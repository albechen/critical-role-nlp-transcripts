00:00:03.462 --> 00:00:07.158
MATT: Everyone, welcome to the new
episode of Critical Role.

00:00:07.158 --> 00:00:09.003
This evening, we luckily
have Ashley Johnson

00:00:09.003 --> 00:00:10.731
back in as her character Pike.

00:00:10.731 --> 00:00:13.462
Unfortunately, Laura
Bailey will be gone for

00:00:13.462 --> 00:00:15.669
most of the game, possibly,
she might come in,

00:00:15.669 --> 00:00:18.160
'cause she's busy recording
a show with Wil Wheaton.

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.211
It's gonna be a great
show, but we'll miss her,

00:00:20.211 --> 00:00:22.130
until she shows up.

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:25.030
However, we shall see what
the next chapter has in store

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:25.863
in just a moment.

00:00:25.863 --> 00:00:26.696
In the meantime,

00:00:26.696 --> 00:00:29.869
let's go ahead and get you situated
with the character backgrounds.

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:31.412
TRAVIS: Right, listen up.

00:00:31.412 --> 00:00:35.579
If you have ale, then you have
a friend in Grog Strongjaw.

00:00:37.038 --> 00:00:40.743
A goliath of towering height and size.

00:00:40.743 --> 00:00:43.898
This barbarian has an appetite for the two

00:00:43.898 --> 00:00:45.846
great loves in his life:

00:00:45.846 --> 00:00:47.763
combat, women, and ale.

00:00:49.778 --> 00:00:50.776
(record scratch)

00:00:50.776 --> 00:00:51.665
Wait.

00:00:51.665 --> 00:00:54.164
Easily the brains of the group,

00:00:54.164 --> 00:00:57.541
Grog is often consulted
for his vast knowledge

00:00:57.541 --> 00:01:01.653
of shapes, colors, and
(giggles), shiny things.

00:01:01.653 --> 00:01:03.567
But also ale.

00:01:03.567 --> 00:01:07.603
In his early years, armed
with his two handed gray axe,

00:01:07.603 --> 00:01:09.857
Grog often enjoyed proving his might

00:01:09.857 --> 00:01:13.280
amongst the ranks of his
family's wandering herd.

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:14.410
But after coming upon

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:17.669
an unsuspecting elderly
gnome in the woods,

00:01:17.669 --> 00:01:21.748
he objected to the killing
of such an innocent life.

00:01:21.748 --> 00:01:25.915
A creature of impulse, Grog
felt only pity for this,

00:01:26.783 --> 00:01:29.962
this terrified little thing.

00:01:29.962 --> 00:01:33.242
His disobedience cost him dearly.

00:01:33.242 --> 00:01:36.727
Beaten bloody, and banished
by the herd leader,

00:01:36.727 --> 00:01:40.894
his uncle Kevdak, Grog was
abandoned, and left to die.

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.657
Exiled from his herd,

00:01:43.657 --> 00:01:46.898
it was then that the
relative of the very gnome

00:01:46.898 --> 00:01:49.315
he fought to save, saved him.

00:01:50.445 --> 00:01:54.071
It was the kindness of a
gnome cleric named Pike

00:01:54.071 --> 00:01:58.143
that healed Grog, bringing
him back from death's edge.

00:01:58.143 --> 00:02:01.631
And they have remained
close friends ever since.

00:02:01.631 --> 00:02:04.458
Most nights, Grog can be found challenging

00:02:04.458 --> 00:02:07.628
entire taverns to wrestling matches.

00:02:07.628 --> 00:02:11.112
Or accompanying Scanlan
to the nearest house,

00:02:11.112 --> 00:02:13.612
where you pay for lady favors.

00:02:14.868 --> 00:02:15.701
Also ale.

00:02:16.669 --> 00:02:18.650
MARISHA: A first impression of Keyleth

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:20.887
would leave you with little information

00:02:20.887 --> 00:02:22.762
on the half-elven druid.

00:02:22.762 --> 00:02:25.079
You might even think that
her social awkwardness

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:28.599
due to her sheltered
upbringing is kind of sweet.

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:31.319
Of course it would be
unwise to underestimate her

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:33.079
based on first impressions.

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:34.773
(thunder clap)

00:02:34.773 --> 00:02:37.344
Under that unintimidating, petite frame

00:02:37.344 --> 00:02:39.957
is a vicious beast,
waiting to be unleashed,

00:02:39.957 --> 00:02:42.364
whose natural powers have
made even the fiercest

00:02:42.364 --> 00:02:44.762
of champions pee their pants.

00:02:44.762 --> 00:02:45.595
Literally.

00:02:45.595 --> 00:02:46.735
(giggles)

00:02:46.735 --> 00:02:49.640
Born to the air tribe of the Ashari people,

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.292
Keyleth was raised with
a deep love of nature

00:02:52.292 --> 00:02:54.252
and the elemental magics.

00:02:54.252 --> 00:02:55.929
It is her people's inherent duty

00:02:55.929 --> 00:02:58.712
to protect the delicate areas in Tal'Dorei

00:02:58.712 --> 00:03:00.427
where the four elemental planes

00:03:00.427 --> 00:03:02.828
begin to bleed with this realm.

00:03:02.828 --> 00:03:04.325
Since she was a little girl,

00:03:04.325 --> 00:03:06.575
she had quite a knack
for air manipulation,

00:03:06.575 --> 00:03:08.690
and beast shaping abilities.

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:11.718
Well, if you consider
kittens and flying squirrels

00:03:11.718 --> 00:03:13.334
to be little beasts.

00:03:13.334 --> 00:03:14.334
Which, I do.

00:03:15.348 --> 00:03:16.352
Anyways.

00:03:16.352 --> 00:03:18.824
It wasn't long before the
headmaster of the tribe,

00:03:18.824 --> 00:03:22.650
her father, Korren, realized
her true prodigious abilities,

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.877
and she was inveterated to succeed him

00:03:24.877 --> 00:03:27.012
as the next headmaster.

00:03:27.012 --> 00:03:30.108
Just like that, her jovial
childhood was stripped,

00:03:30.108 --> 00:03:32.769
and replaced with endless
spell memorization,

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:34.605
teachings from ancient traditions,

00:03:34.605 --> 00:03:37.105
and exceedingly high expectations.

00:03:37.105 --> 00:03:39.944
Every druid leader-to-be
must embark on a journey

00:03:39.944 --> 00:03:41.555
to seek out the sister tribes

00:03:41.555 --> 00:03:44.052
in order to introduce
and establish respect

00:03:44.052 --> 00:03:46.213
amongst the fellow headmasters.

00:03:46.213 --> 00:03:50.270
They call this the
Aramente, or Noble Odyssey.

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:52.073
When her father felt she was ready,

00:03:52.073 --> 00:03:55.198
he set her on the path to
truly discovering herself,

00:03:55.198 --> 00:03:58.852
not knowing when or if
she will ever return.

00:03:58.852 --> 00:04:01.547
As she hiked down the
mountain towards Stilben,

00:04:01.547 --> 00:04:03.977
she meditated on the task ahead.

00:04:03.977 --> 00:04:06.314
Part of the Aramente is proving yourself

00:04:06.314 --> 00:04:09.326
a strong warrior, a valiant protector,

00:04:09.326 --> 00:04:11.881
and a wise, and compassionate leader.

00:04:11.881 --> 00:04:13.386
With this knowledge,

00:04:13.386 --> 00:04:16.719
one thought plays in repeat in her mind:

00:04:17.594 --> 00:04:19.177
Is she even worthy?

00:04:21.392 --> 00:04:23.773
TALIESIN: Percy was the
third of seven children,

00:04:23.773 --> 00:04:26.689
born to a noble family who
lived far to the north,

00:04:26.689 --> 00:04:29.140
in the ancient castle of Whitestone.

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:31.962
With so many siblings to
share the burdens of lordship,

00:04:31.962 --> 00:04:34.504
Percy turned his
attentions to the sciences,

00:04:34.504 --> 00:04:37.104
engineering, and naturalism.

00:04:37.104 --> 00:04:39.333
One day, a mysterious couple

00:04:39.333 --> 00:04:42.176
named Lord and Lady
Briarwood came to court.

00:04:42.176 --> 00:04:44.159
During a feast held in their honor,

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:47.332
the Briarwoods violently
took control of the castle,

00:04:47.332 --> 00:04:49.116
killing or imprisoning everyone

00:04:49.116 --> 00:04:51.201
who would stand in their way.

00:04:51.201 --> 00:04:53.296
Percy awoke chained in the dungeon,

00:04:53.296 --> 00:04:55.699
only to be freed by his younger sister.

00:04:55.699 --> 00:04:59.439
Together they fled, chased
by the Briarwoods' men.

00:04:59.439 --> 00:05:01.449
As they ran, Percy's sister

00:05:01.449 --> 00:05:04.524
took several arrows to
the chest, and fell.

00:05:04.524 --> 00:05:05.777
Percy kept running,

00:05:05.777 --> 00:05:08.077
eventually jumping into a freezing river,

00:05:08.077 --> 00:05:10.555
and floating unconscious to freedom.

00:05:10.555 --> 00:05:13.409
He did not remember waking
up on a fishing boat.

00:05:13.409 --> 00:05:15.365
He barely remembered the next two years

00:05:15.365 --> 00:05:19.384
as he slowly made his way
as far south as possible.

00:05:19.384 --> 00:05:22.106
Then one night, Percy had a dream.

00:05:22.106 --> 00:05:25.197
A roaring cloud of smoke
offered him vengeance

00:05:25.197 --> 00:05:27.872
against those who destroyed his family.

00:05:27.872 --> 00:05:32.039
When he awoke, Percy began
to design his first gun.

00:05:32.039 --> 00:05:33.304
(gunshot)

00:05:35.017 --> 00:05:36.458
SAM: Oh, you haven't heard

00:05:36.458 --> 00:05:38.331
of Scanlan Shorthalt?

00:05:38.331 --> 00:05:40.015
Well gird your loins ladies

00:05:40.015 --> 00:05:42.039
because he has his eyes on you.

00:05:42.039 --> 00:05:44.342
A talented musician, master of disguise,

00:05:44.342 --> 00:05:46.794
and dashingly handsome in his own mind,

00:05:46.794 --> 00:05:49.017
Scanlan sings songs almost as much

00:05:49.017 --> 00:05:51.513
as he sings his own praises.

00:05:51.513 --> 00:05:53.155
Born a poor gnome,

00:05:53.155 --> 00:05:56.087
Scanlan used his endless
charm and soaring tenor voice

00:05:56.087 --> 00:05:59.371
to croon for coin and
support his single mother.

00:05:59.371 --> 00:06:02.226
One day he was discovered
by a half orc promoter,

00:06:02.226 --> 00:06:06.046
and joined Dr. Dranzel's
Spectacular Traveling Troop,

00:06:06.046 --> 00:06:08.292
where he learned the ways of the world,

00:06:08.292 --> 00:06:11.857
and honed his skills as
a bard extraordinaire.

00:06:11.857 --> 00:06:13.362
A loner much of his life,

00:06:13.362 --> 00:06:15.161
Scanlan has never quite come to terms

00:06:15.161 --> 00:06:16.941
with the violent death of his mother

00:06:16.941 --> 00:06:18.996
at the hands of a goblin invasion.

00:06:18.996 --> 00:06:21.542
While his years on the road provided many,

00:06:21.542 --> 00:06:26.095
shall we say, educational
experiences with the opposite sex,

00:06:26.095 --> 00:06:29.960
deep down Scanlan yearns for
the one thing he's never known:

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:33.395
the true love of a fellow gnome.

00:06:33.395 --> 00:06:36.441
Still, Scanlan considers
himself a lover first,

00:06:36.441 --> 00:06:39.776
performer second, and
fighter a distant third.

00:06:39.776 --> 00:06:42.074
On the battlefield,
he'll support his allies,

00:06:42.074 --> 00:06:44.068
but rarely draws blood,

00:06:44.068 --> 00:06:46.913
unless it's to protect fellow gnome, Pike.

00:06:46.913 --> 00:06:49.051
Count on Scanlan for a hearty laugh,

00:06:49.051 --> 00:06:51.832
a rollicking song, and
a twinkle in his eye

00:06:51.832 --> 00:06:55.749
that melts hearts, and
makes the females swoon.

00:06:56.672 --> 00:06:57.884
(sputtering)

00:06:57.884 --> 00:07:00.071
ORION: Greetings, and salutations.

00:07:00.071 --> 00:07:02.181
I am Tiberius Stormwind.

00:07:02.181 --> 00:07:04.289
I hail from a town called Tirex,

00:07:04.289 --> 00:07:06.291
located in the heart of Draconia.

00:07:06.291 --> 00:07:08.672
Born from a politically respected family,

00:07:08.672 --> 00:07:12.341
at the age of 15, I succeeded
in passing the sorcerer's right,

00:07:12.341 --> 00:07:14.681
showing prodigy-like control of my magic.

00:07:14.681 --> 00:07:16.593
The judges in the Draconian high council

00:07:16.593 --> 00:07:18.819
were amazed at how powerful my spells were

00:07:18.819 --> 00:07:20.773
for how long I had been training.

00:07:20.773 --> 00:07:21.778
At 20 years old,

00:07:21.778 --> 00:07:24.243
I was the youngest appointed
member of the magic guild

00:07:24.243 --> 00:07:25.885
in Draconian history.

00:07:25.885 --> 00:07:27.867
For the next few years I almost went mad

00:07:27.867 --> 00:07:30.365
from the malaise of being a guild member,

00:07:30.365 --> 00:07:32.290
as it's rather boring.

00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:34.944
However, one day I
happened upon a chamber,

00:07:34.944 --> 00:07:36.858
unused for quite some time.

00:07:36.858 --> 00:07:39.323
In the room were stacks of books and maps,

00:07:39.323 --> 00:07:40.803
of the surrounding cities and areas

00:07:40.803 --> 00:07:42.235
around the known world.

00:07:42.235 --> 00:07:44.496
For months I would frequent the chamber,

00:07:44.496 --> 00:07:46.578
and learn of artifacts from legend.

00:07:46.578 --> 00:07:48.319
After a long period of research,

00:07:48.319 --> 00:07:50.471
I made a list of artifacts
that caught my eye.

00:07:50.471 --> 00:07:52.828
I brought these findings
to the high council

00:07:52.828 --> 00:07:54.893
and was told that all of the information

00:07:54.893 --> 00:07:57.269
in the chamber I stumbled
upon was either believed

00:07:57.269 --> 00:08:00.074
to be fiction or unsolvable mysteries,

00:08:00.074 --> 00:08:02.073
and hence were lost forever.

00:08:02.073 --> 00:08:04.951
I found those answers to be unacceptable.

00:08:04.951 --> 00:08:06.874
A year later I devised a ruse,

00:08:06.874 --> 00:08:08.468
and managed to convince the city council

00:08:08.468 --> 00:08:10.621
to lend support in me leaving Draconia

00:08:10.621 --> 00:08:12.366
on a mission of peace and diplomacy

00:08:12.366 --> 00:08:13.846
for the surrounding kingdoms,

00:08:13.846 --> 00:08:15.724
going from town to town and making friends

00:08:15.724 --> 00:08:18.318
and allies in and for
the name of Draconia.

00:08:18.318 --> 00:08:20.089
Being a red dragonborn,

00:08:20.089 --> 00:08:23.255
I had quite the task on
my hands, in that respect.

00:08:23.255 --> 00:08:24.881
But it was exactly what I needed,

00:08:24.881 --> 00:08:27.930
so I could explore the world
and find these artifacts,

00:08:27.930 --> 00:08:30.416
as I felt the truth was out there.

00:08:30.416 --> 00:08:32.788
Some may describe me as buffoonish,

00:08:32.788 --> 00:08:34.099
but I say poppycock to all that!

00:08:34.099 --> 00:08:35.190
(sputtering)

00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:37.592
I am much sharper than
most give me credit for.

00:08:37.592 --> 00:08:40.624
I just don't pay attention
to things sometimes.

00:08:40.624 --> 00:08:42.984
I've also been known to be rather cunning,

00:08:42.984 --> 00:08:46.651
loyal, happy go lucky,
and, well, dangerous.

00:08:47.644 --> 00:08:50.936
I can't help but show my true
scales every now and then.

00:08:50.936 --> 00:08:55.870
But overall, I think I'm quite
friendly for a dragonborn.

00:08:55.870 --> 00:08:57.135
LIAM: Never entirely welcome

00:08:57.135 --> 00:08:59.086
in the company of elves or men,

00:08:59.086 --> 00:09:03.019
Vax’ildan learned at a young
age to skip past formality,

00:09:03.019 --> 00:09:06.386
preferring instead to
invite himself in your door.

00:09:06.386 --> 00:09:08.814
Along with twin sister Vex'ahlia,

00:09:08.814 --> 00:09:10.666
Vax was born by a chance encounter

00:09:10.666 --> 00:09:14.383
between elven royalty and human peasantry.

00:09:14.383 --> 00:09:16.608
Raised by their mother
in their early years,

00:09:16.608 --> 00:09:18.795
the twins were eventually
sent off to their father

00:09:18.795 --> 00:09:21.021
in the elven capitol of Syngorn.

00:09:21.021 --> 00:09:24.732
But their cool reception among
the elves there never warmed,

00:09:24.732 --> 00:09:27.153
and their time in the capitol didn't last.

00:09:27.153 --> 00:09:29.652
The siblings stole away one autumn night,

00:09:29.652 --> 00:09:32.178
and set out on the open road.

00:09:32.178 --> 00:09:33.929
After a few years of wandering,

00:09:33.929 --> 00:09:36.816
they eventually decided
to return to their mother,

00:09:36.816 --> 00:09:39.173
and journey back to the lands of their youth.

00:09:39.173 --> 00:09:42.267
But instead of finding
their childhood home,

00:09:42.267 --> 00:09:44.764
they returned to a pile of rubble.

00:09:44.764 --> 00:09:48.427
Their mother was gone,
their home burned to ash.

00:09:48.427 --> 00:09:51.305
Pressing the townspeople for answers,

00:09:51.305 --> 00:09:53.521
they learned of the day the dragon came.

00:09:53.521 --> 00:09:55.688
(roaring)

00:09:57.050 --> 00:09:58.964
With their ties all severed,

00:09:58.964 --> 00:10:00.798
Vax’ildan and his sister set out

00:10:00.798 --> 00:10:04.360
to find their fortune together in Tal'dorei.

00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:07.373
An outsider since birth,
Vax quickly learned

00:10:07.373 --> 00:10:11.331
to solve life's challenges
in his own particular way,

00:10:11.331 --> 00:10:14.116
often by side-stepping them entirely.

00:10:14.116 --> 00:10:17.830
And when his knack for circumventing
adversity isn't enough,

00:10:17.830 --> 00:10:19.487
(drawing blades)

00:10:19.487 --> 00:10:22.111
the way of blades the
elves schooled him in

00:10:22.111 --> 00:10:25.001
more than makes up the difference.

00:10:25.001 --> 00:10:26.981
LAURA: Like so many half elves,

00:10:26.981 --> 00:10:29.227
Vex'ahlia has spent most of her life

00:10:29.227 --> 00:10:31.821
suffering the cool reception of a people

00:10:31.821 --> 00:10:34.155
who don't fully accept her.

00:10:34.155 --> 00:10:37.233
Born of a human mother
and an elven father,

00:10:37.233 --> 00:10:40.738
who only later in life took an
interest in their existence,

00:10:40.738 --> 00:10:43.729
Vex'ahlia and her twin brother Vax’ildan

00:10:43.729 --> 00:10:47.415
quickly realized the only
people they could truly rely on

00:10:47.415 --> 00:10:50.605
in this world were each other.

00:10:50.605 --> 00:10:52.455
It was at the age of ten when the two

00:10:52.455 --> 00:10:54.189
were taken from their mother,

00:10:54.189 --> 00:10:56.055
and brought to live in Syngorn,

00:10:56.055 --> 00:10:58.457
the isolated elven city
for which their father

00:10:58.457 --> 00:11:00.129
was an ambassador.

00:11:00.129 --> 00:11:04.525
He quietly took them in, but
always kept an icy distance.

00:11:04.525 --> 00:11:07.313
And after too many years
of disdainful looks,

00:11:07.313 --> 00:11:10.830
the pair decided to leave
his indifference behind

00:11:10.830 --> 00:11:12.835
and set out on their own.

00:11:12.835 --> 00:11:16.958
Vax took to the cities,
stealing small trinkets

00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:19.447
and learning the ways of a thief.

00:11:19.447 --> 00:11:22.176
While Vex kept to the woods.

00:11:22.176 --> 00:11:24.469
She preferred the isolation.

00:11:24.469 --> 00:11:27.686
Always the keen observer,
she learned to hunt,

00:11:27.686 --> 00:11:31.036
and to track, to spy, and to shoot.

00:11:31.036 --> 00:11:33.666
And through a series of fateful events,

00:11:33.666 --> 00:11:37.368
earned herself a companion
in the form of a bear--

00:11:37.368 --> 00:11:41.241
her own stolen trinket--
to fight along side her

00:11:41.241 --> 00:11:43.826
and protect her fiercely.

00:11:43.826 --> 00:11:45.846
Also he is adorable.

00:11:45.846 --> 00:11:48.013
And gives expert massages.

00:11:49.186 --> 00:11:50.711
TRAVIS: Right, listen up.

00:11:50.711 --> 00:11:54.878
If you have ale, then you have
a friend in Grog Strongjaw.

00:11:56.296 --> 00:12:00.028
A goliath of towering height and size,

00:12:00.028 --> 00:12:02.279
this Barbarian has an appetite

00:12:02.279 --> 00:12:05.211
for the two great loves in his life:

00:12:05.211 --> 00:12:07.128
combat, women, and ale.

00:12:08.891 --> 00:12:09.952
(record scratch)

00:12:09.952 --> 00:12:10.885
Wait.

00:12:10.885 --> 00:12:13.383
Easily the brains of the group,

00:12:13.383 --> 00:12:16.777
Grog is often consulted
for his vast knowledge

00:12:16.777 --> 00:12:20.901
of shapes, colors, and
(giggles), shiny things.

00:12:20.901 --> 00:12:22.765
But also ale.

00:12:22.765 --> 00:12:26.861
In his early years, armed
with his two-handed great axe,

00:12:26.861 --> 00:12:28.945
Grog often enjoyed proving his might

00:12:28.945 --> 00:12:32.465
amongst the ranks of his
family's wandering herd.

00:12:32.465 --> 00:12:34.814
But after coming upon an unsuspecting

00:12:34.814 --> 00:12:36.384
elderly gnome in the wood--

00:12:37.014 --> 00:12:38.167
MATT: Welcome back.

00:12:38.167 --> 00:12:40.307
Unfortunately, we don't have
Pike's video ready yet.

00:12:40.307 --> 00:12:41.140
I'm working on it.

00:12:41.140 --> 00:12:41.973
ASHLEY: My bad.

00:12:41.973 --> 00:12:42.842
MATT: This week got away from me,

00:12:42.842 --> 00:12:43.922
and Ashley got it to me a little late,

00:12:43.922 --> 00:12:45.551
but we'll have it up
next week, don't worry.

00:12:45.551 --> 00:12:47.702
However we are happy
to have Ashley with us.

00:12:47.702 --> 00:12:49.952
(all cheer)

00:12:50.992 --> 00:12:53.941
She's come down from her BAFTA cloud.

00:12:53.941 --> 00:12:55.342
(all laugh)

00:12:55.342 --> 00:12:56.861
Which is amazing, congratulations again.

00:12:56.861 --> 00:12:58.911
ASHLEY: Thank you guys.

00:12:58.911 --> 00:13:00.940
MATT: So yeah, as a heads up too,

00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:02.476
if you wanna do any quick
announcements real fast,

00:13:02.476 --> 00:13:03.817
I think you had an announcement
you wanted to make.

00:13:03.817 --> 00:13:05.492
ASHLEY: It's my mom's birthday today.

00:13:05.492 --> 00:13:06.539
(all cheer)

00:13:06.539 --> 00:13:08.628
MATT: Happy birthday Ashley's mom, yay!

00:13:08.628 --> 00:13:09.641
ASHLEY: Her name's Nancy.

00:13:09.641 --> 00:13:10.474
LIAM: Hi Nancy.

00:13:10.474 --> 00:13:12.246
TRAVIS: Happy birthday, Nancy.

00:13:12.246 --> 00:13:13.737
Totally watching this right now.

00:13:13.737 --> 00:13:15.239
MARISHA: Is she watching?

00:13:15.239 --> 00:13:16.562
ASHLEY: She probably is.

00:13:16.562 --> 00:13:18.708
(all laugh)

00:13:18.708 --> 00:13:19.791
MATT: Well, hello!

00:13:20.850 --> 00:13:22.854
Also for those who are
Hearthstone players,

00:13:22.854 --> 00:13:25.857
the new Black Hawk Mountain
Expansion came out today,

00:13:25.857 --> 00:13:28.369
in which I voice Nefarian and Ragnaros.

00:13:28.369 --> 00:13:29.653
(all cheer)

00:13:29.653 --> 00:13:32.110
My vanilla-WoW-playing self 
from back in the day

00:13:32.110 --> 00:13:33.982
is nerding out over that, so enjoy that.

00:13:33.982 --> 00:13:35.289
Anyone have anything
else they wanna announce

00:13:35.289 --> 00:13:36.258
or talk about?

00:13:36.258 --> 00:13:37.361
Are we good to start?

00:13:37.361 --> 00:13:38.293
SAM: Hi, mom!

00:13:38.293 --> 00:13:39.126
MARISHA: Hi, mom.

00:13:39.915 --> 00:13:40.915
MATT: All righty.

00:13:40.915 --> 00:13:43.637
TRAVIS: I don't think my mom knows
what the internet is.

00:13:46.058 --> 00:13:49.025
ORION: Related, I leveled my
undead holy priest to 64

00:13:49.025 --> 00:13:50.518
last night, on Warcraft.

00:13:50.518 --> 00:13:52.347
ZAC: We're just
about a thousand happy--

00:13:52.347 --> 00:13:53.913
MATT: Congrats.

00:13:53.913 --> 00:13:56.103
Way to go, level 64.

00:13:56.103 --> 00:13:59.516
So you're just barely into
burning crusade, good man.

00:13:59.516 --> 00:14:00.349
(all laugh)

00:14:00.349 --> 00:14:01.645
TALIESIN: I got one too.

00:14:01.645 --> 00:14:04.015
My brother who also works in video games

00:14:04.015 --> 00:14:06.588
gave a talk at GVC this year,
and it just went online,

00:14:06.588 --> 00:14:10.177
and not now but later you should watch

00:14:10.177 --> 00:14:13.719
Alex Jaffe's talk on metagame balancing.

00:14:13.719 --> 00:14:15.817
It's really really fun, it's fabulous,

00:14:15.817 --> 00:14:17.229
and you learn a lot.

00:14:17.229 --> 00:14:19.412
MATT: There you go, Alex Jaffe, look it up.

00:14:19.412 --> 00:14:20.535
MARISHA: Alex is brilliant.

00:14:20.535 --> 00:14:23.208
MATT: All right guys, so, getting
to the game at hand.

00:14:23.208 --> 00:14:25.345
So little overview for the story,

00:14:25.345 --> 00:14:27.902
the party has been sent
to the city of Kraghammer,

00:14:27.902 --> 00:14:32.407
through a friend of theirs
named Arcanist Allura Vysoren.

00:14:32.407 --> 00:14:34.257
A good friend of hers and a folk hero

00:14:34.257 --> 00:14:36.686
throughout the land known
as Lady Kima of Vord,

00:14:36.686 --> 00:14:39.412
who's the halfling paladin of Bahamut,
has gone missing.

00:14:39.412 --> 00:14:40.848
She went on a vision quest

00:14:40.848 --> 00:14:43.577
as part of a pilgrimage she's
been on for the past year,

00:14:43.577 --> 00:14:46.344
and sensed a dark evil brewing

00:14:46.344 --> 00:14:48.349
far beneath the city of Kraghammer.

00:14:48.349 --> 00:14:50.873
Disappeared into the city and
hasn't been seen for weeks.

00:14:50.873 --> 00:14:53.302
So Arcanist Allura asked the party,

00:14:53.302 --> 00:14:56.028
hired them essentially, to
go and see her whereabouts.

00:14:56.028 --> 00:14:57.248
Upon getting to Kraghammer,

00:14:57.248 --> 00:15:00.072
they interacted with some
of the local characters,

00:15:00.072 --> 00:15:01.905
eventually found theirself talking

00:15:01.905 --> 00:15:05.313
to Lord Nostoc Greyspine, who
owns the mines at the very bottom

00:15:05.313 --> 00:15:08.151
of Kraghammer proper.

00:15:08.151 --> 00:15:11.319
After a brief encounter
with a mutated abomination

00:15:11.319 --> 00:15:12.663
of a Naga creature,

00:15:12.663 --> 00:15:15.638
they were then hired by lord
Nostoc to go into the mines,

00:15:15.638 --> 00:15:17.960
find whatever's creating
these abominations,

00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:19.909
destroy whatever is the source of them,

00:15:19.909 --> 00:15:22.290
and he will pay well and also pay for each

00:15:22.290 --> 00:15:24.721
creature head that is
brought to him individually.

00:15:24.721 --> 00:15:26.495
After getting into the mines,

00:15:26.495 --> 00:15:29.074
a few battles ensue with
some of the local denizens,

00:15:29.074 --> 00:15:31.982
couple of the umber hulks,
that were turned into snails,

00:15:31.982 --> 00:15:34.776
and other interesting circumstances.

00:15:34.776 --> 00:15:36.615
The party then found 
what looked to be

00:15:36.615 --> 00:15:38.311
an entirely abandoned goblin city,

00:15:38.311 --> 00:15:40.357
and a series of goblinoid corpses,

00:15:40.357 --> 00:15:43.345
many of which had bored
holes in their skull

00:15:43.345 --> 00:15:45.484
in various states of decay.

00:15:45.484 --> 00:15:48.382
They found a long bridge
across an open chasm.

00:15:48.382 --> 00:15:50.987
Upon traversing it,
Scanlan went invisible,

00:15:50.987 --> 00:15:53.340
and found what looked
like a duergar war camp,

00:15:53.340 --> 00:15:56.406
which are like ashy-skinned, evil dwarves

00:15:56.406 --> 00:15:58.477
that live deep underground.

00:15:58.477 --> 00:16:00.934
Watched a dwarf get executed
by what appeared to be

00:16:00.934 --> 00:16:03.126
some sort of strange alienoid creature,

00:16:03.126 --> 00:16:05.933
that was revealed to be an
illithid, or a mind flayer.

00:16:05.933 --> 00:16:09.416
A being that is psychic
and consumes brains.

00:16:09.946 --> 00:16:11.117
ASHLEY: Brains!

00:16:11.117 --> 00:16:12.250
MATT: Upon returning,

00:16:12.250 --> 00:16:13.959
the party had a plan to lead them

00:16:13.959 --> 00:16:16.597
off of a illusionary cliff,
that went pretty well.

00:16:16.597 --> 00:16:19.062
Ended up taking out a significant portion

00:16:19.062 --> 00:16:21.773
of the charging army at the time.

00:16:21.773 --> 00:16:24.054
Vax here, however, got
stunned on the way across

00:16:24.054 --> 00:16:27.382
by the one mind flayer, nearly fell,
however was saved by Tiberius

00:16:27.382 --> 00:16:28.669
at the last moment.

00:16:29.313 --> 00:16:32.012
Nearly lost their magic
carpet, but it was retrieved.

00:16:32.012 --> 00:16:33.893
ASHLEY: Wait, you still have
the magic carpet, right?

00:16:33.893 --> 00:16:35.894
MATT: Yeah, it got recovered. Barely.

00:16:35.894 --> 00:16:38.420
MARISHA: We got it back, it's okay.

00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:39.969
TRAVIS: Not thanks to some.

00:16:39.969 --> 00:16:41.962
MATT: (laughs)

00:16:41.962 --> 00:16:44.557
After brief discussion, Keyleth and Vex

00:16:44.557 --> 00:16:47.215
decided they didn't want to listen
to anyone's bullshit,

00:16:47.215 --> 00:16:50.017
and hijacked magic carpet,

00:16:50.017 --> 00:16:52.188
flew down into the chasm below,

00:16:52.188 --> 00:16:55.473
and discovered behind one of
the underground waterfalls

00:16:55.473 --> 00:16:56.890
some sort of a

00:16:58.317 --> 00:17:00.752
mind flayer who was
cast out from the society,

00:17:00.752 --> 00:17:04.048
covered in rags, kind of
a twisted physical form,

00:17:04.048 --> 00:17:05.723
and after a very tense discussion

00:17:05.723 --> 00:17:08.377
seemed to befriend it under the guise of

00:17:08.377 --> 00:17:12.625
mutually agreed retribution
against those that are oppressive

00:17:12.625 --> 00:17:14.682
to this whole chasm area.

00:17:14.682 --> 00:17:16.146
MARISHA: Clarence.

00:17:16.146 --> 00:17:17.700
LIAM and SAM: Clarota.

00:17:19.664 --> 00:17:21.873
MATT: Clarota. I don't think he'll
take kindly to Clarence.

00:17:21.873 --> 00:17:26.040
However, this is where we
left off the previous game.

00:17:28.933 --> 00:17:30.016
ASHLEY: So nervous.

00:17:32.085 --> 00:17:34.375
MATT: As you guys have gathered up,

00:17:34.375 --> 00:17:36.623
and you've finished your luxurious song

00:17:36.623 --> 00:17:39.123
to try and ease his torn form,

00:17:40.470 --> 00:17:43.153
he finishes tapping his
toe in spite of himself.

00:17:43.153 --> 00:17:45.238
Looks about the rest
of the group and says,

00:17:45.238 --> 00:17:46.747
once again, not vocally,

00:17:46.747 --> 00:17:48.525
but speaking directly into your mind,

00:17:48.525 --> 00:17:50.341
through a horrifying whispered voice

00:17:50.341 --> 00:17:53.037
that you cannot even close
your ears to get rid of,

00:17:53.037 --> 00:17:56.860
"I think it's best we rest out of sight."

00:17:56.860 --> 00:17:58.753
He points across the chasm,

00:17:58.753 --> 00:18:02.277
to the war camp that is
looming across the way.

00:18:02.277 --> 00:18:04.383
He begins to dart off
towards the abandoned

00:18:04.383 --> 00:18:06.291
goblinoid village.

00:18:07.789 --> 00:18:09.945
ORION: I guess we should follow him, then.

00:18:09.945 --> 00:18:11.476
SAM: Yes, that's wise.

00:18:11.476 --> 00:18:13.313
TALIESIN: I think that's a great idea.

00:18:13.313 --> 00:18:14.136
SAM: We follow.

00:18:14.136 --> 00:18:16.603
TALIESIN: No, nothing can be there.

00:18:16.603 --> 00:18:19.771
MATT: As you guys make your way in
toward the goblinoid village,

00:18:19.771 --> 00:18:23.213
you can see Clarota who
is genuinely hovering

00:18:23.213 --> 00:18:24.839
about a foot off the ground,

00:18:24.839 --> 00:18:29.064
and kind of just coasting
around in a very creepy way.

00:18:29.064 --> 00:18:31.515
Finds one tent, opens up and looks inside,

00:18:31.515 --> 00:18:34.320
"Here, here we can talk."

00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:35.403
Darts inside.

00:18:36.590 --> 00:18:37.578
TRAVIS: We follow.

00:18:37.578 --> 00:18:39.613
SAM: We do follow, yes.

00:18:39.613 --> 00:18:41.362
MATT: As you're following--

00:18:41.362 --> 00:18:42.195
TRAVIS: Oh crap.

00:18:42.195 --> 00:18:43.028
SAM: Oh God, we're dead.

00:18:43.028 --> 00:18:44.568
TRAVIS: Why?

00:18:44.568 --> 00:18:46.083
Why would he touch his dice?

00:18:46.083 --> 00:18:47.712
We're gonna die!

00:18:47.712 --> 00:18:50.505
MATT: As you're following towards
the center of this town,

00:18:50.505 --> 00:18:53.387
you, see in the distance,
a small light moving,

00:18:53.387 --> 00:18:55.585
back from the direction
where you first saw

00:18:55.585 --> 00:18:59.252
that duergar camp, where
Grog was assaulted.

00:19:00.758 --> 00:19:02.832
TRAVIS: I don't recall that.

00:19:02.832 --> 00:19:04.316
LIAM: Look back the way we came,

00:19:04.316 --> 00:19:07.684
there's some sort of light up ahead.

00:19:07.684 --> 00:19:09.362
ORION: That can't be good.

00:19:09.362 --> 00:19:11.573
LIAM: Stay with Clarota, I'm
gonna go take a look,

00:19:11.573 --> 00:19:12.446
Scanlan, come on.

00:19:12.446 --> 00:19:13.946
SAM: I'm coming with.

00:19:15.011 --> 00:19:16.892
MATT: Both of you guys roll stealth.

00:19:16.892 --> 00:19:19.419
TRAVIS: I'll stay outside the
tent if somebody wants

00:19:19.419 --> 00:19:22.502
to ask him how to get a
Magneto helmet like his.

00:19:22.502 --> 00:19:23.510
(all laugh)

00:19:23.510 --> 00:19:24.468
'Cause I'm gonna need that.

00:19:24.468 --> 00:19:25.812
ORION: I'll talk to him.

00:19:25.812 --> 00:19:27.577
SAM: It's just a roll? Not great.

00:19:27.577 --> 00:19:28.757
Nine!

00:19:28.757 --> 00:19:29.971
LIAM: 29.

00:19:29.971 --> 00:19:31.753
TALIESIN: That's a number.

00:19:31.753 --> 00:19:32.836
MATT: So, as you

00:19:34.499 --> 00:19:38.160
officially vanish into the
ether and surrounding darkness,

00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:39.958
Scanlan, who still has that song

00:19:39.958 --> 00:19:41.827
stuck in his head from earlier,

00:19:41.827 --> 00:19:44.646
his slow jam is just...
(laughs)

00:19:44.646 --> 00:19:47.084
Abstractedly humming to
himself without realizing,

00:19:47.084 --> 00:19:48.895
and calling a little bit of attention,

00:19:48.895 --> 00:19:52.684
at which point you began
to hear some footsteps

00:19:52.684 --> 00:19:55.443
in the distance that come
to an immediate halt.

00:19:55.443 --> 00:19:58.072
LIAM: Grab Scanlan, put my hand
over his mouth, and say,

00:19:58.072 --> 00:20:00.021
Quiet, man, what's wrong with you?

00:20:00.021 --> 00:20:02.730
SAM: It's a nervous habit! I'm sorry!

00:20:02.730 --> 00:20:04.575
(all laugh)

00:20:04.575 --> 00:20:07.796
LIAM: With great power comes great
responsibility, shut up!

00:20:07.796 --> 00:20:10.595
SAM: It's a gift I have to
share with the world!

00:20:10.595 --> 00:20:12.074
LIAM: Later, later.

00:20:12.074 --> 00:20:15.203
Save it for the mind flayer.

00:20:15.203 --> 00:20:18.771
So with him tucked under
my arm like a football,

00:20:18.771 --> 00:20:20.688
I start to creep further.

00:20:21.996 --> 00:20:25.360
And try to make out--
if there's light from the lantern,

00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:27.845
I can see in dim light, thanks to
daddy's blood, so.

00:20:27.845 --> 00:20:30.175
I'm gonna try to figure
out what it is exactly

00:20:30.175 --> 00:20:31.188
that I'm seeing.

00:20:31.188 --> 00:20:33.328
MATT: Go ahead and make
a perception check.

00:20:33.328 --> 00:20:35.011
SAM: I also have low light vision.

00:20:35.011 --> 00:20:37.833
MATT: You can make perception
check with disadvantage,

00:20:37.833 --> 00:20:39.318
because you're under his arm.

00:20:39.318 --> 00:20:40.318
LIAM: Perception check? Oh.

00:20:40.758 --> 00:20:41.631
SAM: Nope.

00:20:42.721 --> 00:20:44.704
LIAM: Do I have any advantage on that?

00:20:44.704 --> 00:20:45.757
MATT: No.
LIAM: 11.

00:20:45.757 --> 00:20:46.590
MATT: All right.

00:20:47.313 --> 00:20:49.369
Actually, directly
looking in the direction

00:20:49.369 --> 00:20:50.972
of that duergar camp earlier,

00:20:50.972 --> 00:20:53.663
you can see behind a pillar
that's blocking your view,

00:20:53.663 --> 00:20:56.362
it's obstructing your view
of the actual camp proper,

00:20:56.362 --> 00:20:58.492
you can see some movement in the light.

00:20:58.492 --> 00:21:01.202
You hear some shuffling,
it sounds like plate.

00:21:02.902 --> 00:21:07.603
You hear a voice just kind
of muttering to itself.

00:21:07.603 --> 00:21:10.186
A familiar, female gnomish voice.

00:21:11.559 --> 00:21:12.392
LIAM: Pike?

00:21:13.645 --> 00:21:14.820
ASHLEY: Hey guys!

00:21:14.820 --> 00:21:16.764
(all laugh)

00:21:16.764 --> 00:21:17.931
ASHLEY: It's me, Pike!

00:21:19.620 --> 00:21:21.239
LIAM: Jeez, where have you been?

00:21:21.239 --> 00:21:23.930
ASHLEY: Oh man, I've had quite a time.

00:21:23.930 --> 00:21:26.430
I've missed you guys terribly.

00:21:27.847 --> 00:21:29.889
A lot has happened.

00:21:29.889 --> 00:21:32.749
I'm sure for you guys as well.

00:21:32.749 --> 00:21:33.985
SAM: Not so much.

00:21:33.985 --> 00:21:36.667
ORION: I say into my thing,
"Scanlan, what the hell's going on?"

00:21:36.667 --> 00:21:39.294
SAM: Don't worry, it's a friend,
we'll bring her back soon.

00:21:39.294 --> 00:21:41.862
ORION: Okay, well,
there's a mind flayer here.

00:21:41.862 --> 00:21:42.935
SAM: Keep him busy.

00:21:42.935 --> 00:21:43.935
He likes slow jams.

00:21:43.935 --> 00:21:45.221
ORION: Right, right.

00:21:45.221 --> 00:21:47.195
MATT: As you guys take a look at Pike,

00:21:47.195 --> 00:21:49.763
you notice she's fully armored, but dirty,

00:21:49.763 --> 00:21:51.345
she's got sweat across her face,

00:21:51.345 --> 00:21:53.494
looks like she may have
had a couple scuffles

00:21:53.494 --> 00:21:55.942
on the way through here.

00:21:55.942 --> 00:21:56.775
ASHLEY: I did.

00:21:56.775 --> 00:21:58.629
MATT: She's got a wild look to her eyes.

00:21:58.629 --> 00:21:59.545
SAM: Oh my God.

00:21:59.545 --> 00:22:01.333
MATT: Genuinely relieved to see you.

00:22:01.333 --> 00:22:03.188
Pike, you've managed to come down here

00:22:03.188 --> 00:22:04.546
through the front of the mines,

00:22:04.546 --> 00:22:06.515
which for the most part have been clear.

00:22:06.515 --> 00:22:08.963
You follow what details you can
after asking around

00:22:08.963 --> 00:22:11.191
and discovering that the rest of your party

00:22:11.191 --> 00:22:13.029
had ventured below without you.

00:22:13.029 --> 00:22:15.028
You've followed the tracks best you can,

00:22:15.028 --> 00:22:17.545
and are glad that you at
least chose the right path

00:22:17.545 --> 00:22:20.835
and ran into them before you ran into
something far more dangerous.

00:22:20.835 --> 00:22:23.045
What you were inspecting
was this campsite

00:22:23.045 --> 00:22:24.884
that appeared to have been abandoned.

00:22:24.884 --> 00:22:27.133
What caught your eye
was against the stone wall

00:22:27.133 --> 00:22:29.207
right above the ring of stones that form

00:22:29.207 --> 00:22:30.422
the fire itself,

00:22:30.422 --> 00:22:32.588
there is a giant symbol
carved into the stone

00:22:32.588 --> 00:22:35.296
that is a protective sigil of Bahamut,
the platinum dragon,

00:22:35.296 --> 00:22:37.404
which is a religious symbol of protection,

00:22:37.404 --> 00:22:39.923
used in different divine rituals.

00:22:39.923 --> 00:22:41.426
LIAM: We were looking at that,

00:22:41.426 --> 00:22:43.384
we couldn't make heads or tails of it.

00:22:43.384 --> 00:22:44.771
You ever seen that before?

00:22:47.635 --> 00:22:48.477
ASHLEY: No.

00:22:48.477 --> 00:22:50.119
(all laugh)

00:22:50.119 --> 00:22:52.498
MATT: Go ahead and make a religion check.

00:22:52.498 --> 00:22:55.367
LIAM: Are you sure?
Think about it, just for a moment longer.

00:22:55.367 --> 00:22:57.999
ASHLEY: Well give me, actually,
let me rethink on this.

00:22:57.999 --> 00:22:58.880
I think maybe--

00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:00.706
MARISHA: So wait, are we all reunited?

00:23:00.706 --> 00:23:02.153
LIAM: Oh, it's a natural 20!

00:23:02.953 --> 00:23:04.692
MARISHA: Oh, welcome back Pike!

00:23:04.692 --> 00:23:06.109
TRAVIS: The first roll.

00:23:06.109 --> 00:23:07.522
MARISHA: Are we all reunited?

00:23:07.522 --> 00:23:08.802
LIAM: You just forgot.

00:23:08.802 --> 00:23:10.245
ASHLEY: I just-- you know what?

00:23:10.245 --> 00:23:12.172
Actually, now that I'm thinking about it.

00:23:12.172 --> 00:23:13.129
(all laugh)

00:23:13.129 --> 00:23:15.444
MATT: You clutch your 
holy symbol instinctually

00:23:15.444 --> 00:23:18.182
as you reach up and run your fingers
along the stonework,

00:23:18.182 --> 00:23:20.504
tracing the carving across the stone.

00:23:20.504 --> 00:23:22.079
As you do, your eyes close,

00:23:22.079 --> 00:23:25.076
and you feel the warmth
of Sarenrae's presence

00:23:25.076 --> 00:23:27.530
fill your mind for a second,
and for a split moment,

00:23:27.530 --> 00:23:30.863
you can see a well-armored, very driven,

00:23:31.762 --> 00:23:33.985
female halfling with hair pulled back

00:23:33.985 --> 00:23:36.459
into tight brown braids,

00:23:36.459 --> 00:23:38.828
a dark green cloak
thrown over one shoulder,

00:23:38.828 --> 00:23:42.192
who's currently carving
that symbol into the stone.

00:23:42.192 --> 00:23:43.948
You're seeing Lady Kima of Vord,

00:23:43.948 --> 00:23:45.947
the one who left this symbol,

00:23:45.947 --> 00:23:48.609
to protect her campsite
as she made up camp here.

00:23:48.609 --> 00:23:50.759
You don't know how long
ago this transpired,

00:23:50.759 --> 00:23:53.483
but this was definitely
left by her in this tunnel.

00:23:53.483 --> 00:23:55.115
LIAM: What is it?

00:23:55.115 --> 00:23:57.617
ASHLEY: It was left by a woman.

00:23:57.617 --> 00:24:00.166
SAM: Lady Kima, 
the one we're trying to find?

00:24:00.166 --> 00:24:01.421
ASHLEY: Yes, Lady Kima.

00:24:01.421 --> 00:24:02.885
LIAM: How did you know that?

00:24:02.885 --> 00:24:04.773
SAM: Me and Pike are like--

00:24:04.773 --> 00:24:05.690
TRAVIS: Oh, Jesus.

00:24:06.447 --> 00:24:09.333
SAM: It's so great to see you, you
look fantastic by the way.

00:24:09.333 --> 00:24:11.268
ASHLEY: I don't feel fantastic.

00:24:11.268 --> 00:24:15.017
SAM: Bring it in, bring it in, give me a hug.

00:24:15.017 --> 00:24:17.063
Ooh, you smell a little.

00:24:17.063 --> 00:24:18.807
I like it though.

00:24:18.807 --> 00:24:20.516
Somehow it works on you.

00:24:20.516 --> 00:24:23.683
LIAM: We're in a very complicated situation,

00:24:24.547 --> 00:24:27.392
a lot has happened to us.

00:24:27.392 --> 00:24:31.168
We found sort of a war camp down here,

00:24:31.168 --> 00:24:33.251
and there is sort of a

00:24:34.595 --> 00:24:36.477
being, I don't know what to call it.

00:24:36.477 --> 00:24:40.839
He's got a little of
this going on, and he

00:24:40.839 --> 00:24:43.076
speaks and lashes out through his mind.

00:24:43.076 --> 00:24:46.478
We fought a huge force down here,

00:24:46.478 --> 00:24:48.555
and then we ended up
falling into a cavern,

00:24:48.555 --> 00:24:51.264
and then Keyleth and my sister

00:24:51.264 --> 00:24:53.259
found another one, what are they called?

00:24:53.259 --> 00:24:54.092
They're called--

00:24:54.092 --> 00:24:55.415
illithids.

00:24:55.415 --> 00:24:56.248
SAM: Yes, yes.

00:24:56.248 --> 00:24:58.661
And we found a rogue one,

00:24:58.661 --> 00:25:02.307
and we may team up with
him-- or her?-- to go back

00:25:02.307 --> 00:25:05.273
and get revenge and maybe
kick some ass in the camp.

00:25:05.273 --> 00:25:06.860
LIAM: This just happened.

00:25:06.860 --> 00:25:10.301
He seems extremely dangerous, however,

00:25:10.301 --> 00:25:13.487
the forces we faced in the other illithid

00:25:13.487 --> 00:25:16.074
seem maybe worse.
So that's where we're at.

00:25:16.593 --> 00:25:18.629
SAM: So welcome back.

00:25:18.629 --> 00:25:20.125
Great, sounds like a fun time.

00:25:20.125 --> 00:25:22.299
SAM: Let's rejoin our friends, shall we?

00:25:22.299 --> 00:25:24.312
ASHLEY: Let's go kick some ass.

00:25:24.312 --> 00:25:26.879
SAM: So we trot back over to
the dead goblin village.

00:25:26.879 --> 00:25:29.299
MATT: All right, you make your
way back to the tent

00:25:29.299 --> 00:25:30.887
that was originally scouted out.

00:25:30.887 --> 00:25:32.796
The rest of the party's there waiting

00:25:32.796 --> 00:25:35.462
as Clarota is awkwardly
sitting in the far end,

00:25:35.462 --> 00:25:38.955
just looking out as all of you
slowly approach and enter the tent.

00:25:40.427 --> 00:25:42.391
Not speaking, just reactionary,

00:25:42.391 --> 00:25:44.644
and keeping a watch on all of you.

00:25:44.644 --> 00:25:46.616
ORION: I turn to Clarota, I'm like,

00:25:46.616 --> 00:25:48.137
"Ooh, that's our friend, Pike.

00:25:48.137 --> 00:25:49.078
"She's a good ally.

00:25:49.078 --> 00:25:50.395
"Hello, Pike!"

00:25:50.395 --> 00:25:51.598
ASHLEY: Hello everybody.

00:25:51.598 --> 00:25:54.681
ALL: (gasp) Pike!

00:25:55.567 --> 00:25:58.791
ORION: Sometimes we hug as allies, Clarota.

00:25:58.791 --> 00:26:00.335
MARISHA: Where have you been?

00:26:00.335 --> 00:26:02.585
ASHLEY Well, I had quite a time.

00:26:03.532 --> 00:26:05.902
When we were up on the tower,

00:26:07.632 --> 00:26:09.106
I noticed something,

00:26:09.106 --> 00:26:10.456
and I felt...

00:26:10.456 --> 00:26:13.456
I had to leave,
because I started to

00:26:14.998 --> 00:26:16.001
have a vision.

00:26:16.651 --> 00:26:18.318
ORION: Oh, those are fun.

00:26:21.048 --> 00:26:24.444
ASHLEY: I feel like I should talk to
you guys about this later,

00:26:24.444 --> 00:26:25.694
just because--

00:26:25.924 --> 00:26:26.876
SAM: It's personal?

00:26:26.876 --> 00:26:28.592
ASHLEY: What is your name? I'm so sorry.

00:26:28.592 --> 00:26:30.577
I'm Pike, it's very nice to meet you.

00:26:30.577 --> 00:26:33.706
MATT: You get a better look as
you approach this entity.

00:26:33.706 --> 00:26:35.454
You see what looks like a very tall,

00:26:35.454 --> 00:26:38.115
thin, gaunt-looking humanoid
with a hood over the head

00:26:38.115 --> 00:26:39.666
as you approach.

00:26:39.666 --> 00:26:42.604
You get a better look
at the facial features.

00:26:42.604 --> 00:26:46.525
Smooth, kind of dull, bluish-purple skin.

00:26:46.525 --> 00:26:49.860
These sunken, creepy,
yellowish green eyes,

00:26:49.860 --> 00:26:52.215
and instead of where a
mouth or nose would be,

00:26:52.215 --> 00:26:54.847
you see four slightly twitching tentacles.

00:26:54.847 --> 00:26:58.398
Barely obscuring what looks like
a round lamprey-like toothed maw.

00:26:58.398 --> 00:27:00.395
LIAM: Pike, this is Clarota.

00:27:01.858 --> 00:27:03.108
We've just met.

00:27:03.926 --> 00:27:05.274
ASHLEY: Can I shake his hand?

00:27:05.274 --> 00:27:07.214
MATT: Do you wanna reach your hand out?

00:27:07.214 --> 00:27:08.047
ASHLEY: Yes.

00:27:09.271 --> 00:27:11.809
MATT: There is no physical response,

00:27:11.809 --> 00:27:13.857
the hand is not extended, but you hear,

00:27:13.857 --> 00:27:16.568
in the middle of your
mind, at full volume,

00:27:16.568 --> 00:27:18.052
a creepy whispered voice go,

00:27:19.052 --> 00:27:23.119
"Are you to be one of our allies as well?"

00:27:25.627 --> 00:27:26.578
ASHLEY: Yes.

00:27:26.578 --> 00:27:27.854
Of course.

00:27:27.854 --> 00:27:30.712
MATT: "Very well, she may stay."

00:27:30.712 --> 00:27:32.505
ORION: Thank you very much, Clarota.

00:27:32.832 --> 00:27:36.015
ASHLEY: I take my hand and
scratch the back of my head.

00:27:36.015 --> 00:27:37.762
(all laugh)

00:27:37.762 --> 00:27:40.262
MARISHA: I take Pike and I kind of

00:27:41.677 --> 00:27:44.246
pull her out of the tent
really quick, and I'm like--

00:27:44.246 --> 00:27:45.472
SAM: Girl talk.

00:27:45.472 --> 00:27:47.285
MARISHA: Okay he's like a mind flayer,

00:27:47.285 --> 00:27:49.467
and we found him in a
hole under a waterfall,

00:27:49.467 --> 00:27:51.539
but he's cool, but he wants vengeance.

00:27:51.539 --> 00:27:54.412
ASHLEY: Is that-- the thing is
covering, so he can't be--

00:27:54.412 --> 00:27:56.549
MARISHA: He's like outcast, yeah.

00:27:56.549 --> 00:28:00.716
But he's gonna help us fight
all of his tribe who hates us.

00:28:03.118 --> 00:28:04.488
LIAM: Clarota.

00:28:04.488 --> 00:28:07.291
ASHLEY: Do we know for sure 
he's helping us?

00:28:07.291 --> 00:28:08.212
ORION: Yes.

00:28:08.212 --> 00:28:09.573
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:28:09.573 --> 00:28:12.194
LIAM: Can you help us understand your kind?

00:28:13.139 --> 00:28:14.222
Your history?

00:28:15.409 --> 00:28:18.659
How you've come to be here and who this

00:28:19.740 --> 00:28:22.654
individual is that is
fucking with your shit?

00:28:22.654 --> 00:28:24.724
(all laugh)

00:28:24.724 --> 00:28:27.288
MATT: Proverbial statement, I like that.

00:28:27.288 --> 00:28:29.607
At which point Clarota's eyes narrow,

00:28:29.607 --> 00:28:32.017
and you can feel just the
general mood and energy

00:28:32.017 --> 00:28:34.036
of the inside of the tent grows dark.

00:28:34.036 --> 00:28:35.266
It grows mildly

00:28:36.334 --> 00:28:37.167
tense.

00:28:38.940 --> 00:28:41.721
Suddenly you feel this
presence, a voice once again,

00:28:41.721 --> 00:28:44.471
fill your mind as Clarota says,

00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:50.013
"Seven years since I discovered my curse.

00:28:50.013 --> 00:28:54.096
"My form was struck with
the brand of the Arcane.

00:28:55.050 --> 00:28:59.133
"And these foul arts proved
difficult to conceal.

00:29:02.095 --> 00:29:05.178
"My brethren could sense my impurity,

00:29:06.556 --> 00:29:09.139
"my deviation, and cast me out.

00:29:11.582 --> 00:29:14.582
"I was severed from the Elder Brain.

00:29:16.197 --> 00:29:20.197
"And chased on threat of
death, should I return.

00:29:21.379 --> 00:29:25.289
"I wandered these tunnels in squalor,

00:29:25.289 --> 00:29:29.289
"feeding on what paltry
filth I could ensnare,

00:29:30.332 --> 00:29:34.499
"and fleeing from the ones
I could not face alone.

00:29:36.876 --> 00:29:41.043
"In my wandering, I discovered
a duergar stronghold,

00:29:42.847 --> 00:29:44.430
"with a magma pool,

00:29:45.690 --> 00:29:49.985
"and it proved to be a
decent source of sustenance

00:29:49.985 --> 00:29:51.235
"for some time.

00:29:53.988 --> 00:29:57.238
"Paying off the occasional straggler.

00:29:58.464 --> 00:30:01.464
"Suddenly a great battle took place.

00:30:05.198 --> 00:30:09.281
"It appeared something
had sieged the stronghold.

00:30:10.926 --> 00:30:14.804
"Reading the surface
thoughts of the deep dwarves

00:30:14.804 --> 00:30:17.450
"I encountered in the following weeks,

00:30:17.450 --> 00:30:19.617
"I found a shift of power.

00:30:22.148 --> 00:30:25.803
"Whatever had taken this hold had now

00:30:25.803 --> 00:30:29.352
"demanded fealty of them.

00:30:29.352 --> 00:30:34.164
"And they accepted when
faced with annihilation.

00:30:34.164 --> 00:30:37.831
"This entity that took
the duergar by force,

00:30:40.364 --> 00:30:41.947
"they called K'varn.

00:30:44.917 --> 00:30:47.632
"I caught no sight of it.

00:30:47.632 --> 00:30:49.739
"But the fear I could sense,

00:30:49.739 --> 00:30:54.533
"from within these doors
were so primal, so great,

00:30:54.533 --> 00:30:58.033
"that I knew to keep a distance to be safe.

00:31:00.948 --> 00:31:05.115
"But four months ago
one of my estranged people,

00:31:06.795 --> 00:31:09.545
"was captured by these ash-skins,

00:31:10.826 --> 00:31:14.395
"and brought within the obsidian walls,

00:31:14.395 --> 00:31:17.478
"for what I assumed was interrogation.

00:31:19.492 --> 00:31:23.773
"Long after, the bulk of
the Duergar people marched

00:31:23.773 --> 00:31:26.162
"in packs through the long, deep tunnels

00:31:26.162 --> 00:31:29.786
"that led to my people's colony

00:31:29.786 --> 00:31:30.953
"and attacked.

00:31:32.647 --> 00:31:36.480
"Strangely, before much
bloodshed could occur,

00:31:37.862 --> 00:31:42.029
"which I only assume was the
next step in this onslaught,

00:31:43.149 --> 00:31:44.982
"the fighting stopped.

00:31:45.972 --> 00:31:50.410
"And the colony allowed
the ash skins to waltz

00:31:50.410 --> 00:31:54.577
"directly into the temple,
unharmed, unchallenged,

00:31:55.640 --> 00:31:58.223
"where our Elder Brain resides.

00:32:00.379 --> 00:32:05.182
"It wasn't until after I
discovered whoever this

00:32:05.182 --> 00:32:09.349
"K'varn is, they themselves
infiltrated the temple,

00:32:10.633 --> 00:32:14.800
"and somehow took the Elder
Brain under their own control.

00:32:16.775 --> 00:32:20.942
"I watched as my people had
their will robbed of them.

00:32:25.325 --> 00:32:28.580
"And they took the will of all the others

00:32:28.580 --> 00:32:32.080
"that lived and breathed in these tunnels.

00:32:33.568 --> 00:32:37.651
"Now, a terrible army is
forged of both factions.

00:32:41.543 --> 00:32:45.376
"And they walk under the
banner of this K'varn.

00:32:49.683 --> 00:32:53.203
"Since this, I've fled
back to the higher tunnels,

00:32:53.203 --> 00:32:55.396
"and scrounged for materials so I could

00:32:55.396 --> 00:32:58.432
"shield myself from
the iron grip influence

00:32:58.432 --> 00:33:01.182
"of the now enslaved Elder Brain.

00:33:02.556 --> 00:33:04.056
"It took me weeks.

00:33:05.189 --> 00:33:08.832
"But I'm confident I'm
safe from its influence.

00:33:08.832 --> 00:33:09.665
"For now."

00:33:11.933 --> 00:33:15.490
TALIESIN: Is that the thing that
you wear upon your head?

00:33:15.490 --> 00:33:17.056
MATT: As it pulls the hood back,

00:33:17.056 --> 00:33:19.072
you see once again this kind of haphazard,

00:33:19.072 --> 00:33:22.541
metallic cluster of patches of metal,

00:33:22.541 --> 00:33:26.275
and iron, this dull kind
of blue metallish glow,

00:33:26.275 --> 00:33:27.924
that you can only now
see once he's sitting

00:33:27.924 --> 00:33:29.752
in near pitch darkness.

00:33:29.752 --> 00:33:32.082
As he reaches up and
runs his finger along it,

00:33:32.082 --> 00:33:32.915
"Yes.

00:33:34.337 --> 00:33:36.670
"This I feel can protect me.

00:33:38.016 --> 00:33:39.266
"But I think...

00:33:41.830 --> 00:33:45.994
"I think there is a way to change
the tides of this circumstance,

00:33:45.994 --> 00:33:49.827
"I feel that if I could
somehow free my people

00:33:51.272 --> 00:33:54.493
"from the influence of K'varn,

00:33:54.493 --> 00:33:57.874
"release its hold on the hive mind,

00:33:57.874 --> 00:34:01.791
"my people would allow
me to rejoin the colony.

00:34:03.360 --> 00:34:06.122
"To be one again with my family.

00:34:06.122 --> 00:34:07.289
"My brethren."

00:34:09.589 --> 00:34:13.628
LIAM: I have a few questions.
Is that all right?

00:34:13.628 --> 00:34:15.293
MATT: "Yes."

00:34:15.293 --> 00:34:18.460
LIAM: You and your brethren, without this,

00:34:20.277 --> 00:34:21.944
do you think as one?

00:34:23.516 --> 00:34:25.433
MATT: "We think as individuals,

00:34:25.433 --> 00:34:28.911
but the hive mind connects us all.

00:34:28.911 --> 00:34:33.079
"The hive mind gives us
knowledge, history, direction.

00:34:35.328 --> 00:34:37.911
"It is the source of our family."

00:34:39.454 --> 00:34:43.621
LIAM: So, one individual of your
family sees something,

00:34:45.984 --> 00:34:50.606
the entire hive sees the
same, is that correct?

00:34:50.606 --> 00:34:52.118
MATT: "Yes."

00:34:53.513 --> 00:34:54.993
ORION: Oh dear, that's no good.

00:34:54.993 --> 00:34:56.175
(all laugh)

00:34:56.175 --> 00:35:00.342
LIAM: And you mentioned the Arcane
being a stigma upon you?

00:35:01.805 --> 00:35:04.263
MATT: At which point it turns its gaze away,

00:35:04.263 --> 00:35:07.413
and slinks down
into its form slightly.

00:35:10.934 --> 00:35:14.453
LIAM: What do your brethren put their faith in,

00:35:14.453 --> 00:35:15.953
if not the Arcane?

00:35:17.144 --> 00:35:21.061
MATT: "They put their faith in
the arts of the mind.

00:35:22.871 --> 00:35:24.454
"Both understanding,

00:35:25.537 --> 00:35:28.954
"manipulating, controlling, and devouring."

00:35:32.719 --> 00:35:36.664
ORION: Clarota, we've already
allied ourselves with you,

00:35:36.664 --> 00:35:38.772
as we've already agreed.

00:35:38.772 --> 00:35:41.772
MATT: "You'll help me free my people?

00:35:41.772 --> 00:35:45.122
"To be family again, to belong."

00:35:45.122 --> 00:35:46.622
ORION: As we said, yes.

00:35:48.566 --> 00:35:51.160
But the thing you wear on your head,

00:35:51.160 --> 00:35:54.409
it would make us all the more

00:35:54.409 --> 00:35:56.791
equipped to take on this task.

00:35:56.791 --> 00:36:01.750
It's against such powerful mind
creatures, such as yourself,

00:36:01.750 --> 00:36:04.637
I know my way around a
couple Arcane things,

00:36:04.637 --> 00:36:07.399
but nothing of the mind control sorts.

00:36:07.399 --> 00:36:09.865
If someone like me were to be influenced,

00:36:09.865 --> 00:36:11.718
it would be very bad for our group.

00:36:11.718 --> 00:36:13.497
Even yourself, perhaps.

00:36:13.497 --> 00:36:17.478
It would do well to at least maybe show us

00:36:17.478 --> 00:36:19.357
how you built it, and--

00:36:19.357 --> 00:36:21.382
You get what I'm getting at, right?

00:36:21.382 --> 00:36:23.825
TRAVIS: I would like a steel beanie as well.

00:36:23.825 --> 00:36:26.972
ASHLEY: Basically, where do we get one of those?

00:36:26.972 --> 00:36:29.948
MATT: "It would take weeks to build another."

00:36:29.948 --> 00:36:30.781
TRAVIS: Weeks?

00:36:30.781 --> 00:36:32.947
TALIESIN: I would like to take a
look into it if possible,

00:36:32.947 --> 00:36:36.187
and see if it makes sense. I am a builder.

00:36:36.187 --> 00:36:40.327
MARISHA: Maybe we can figure out 
something a little bit more jerryrigged.

00:36:40.327 --> 00:36:44.494
TALIESIN: If we were all hidden, we would
have a distinct advantage.

00:36:45.714 --> 00:36:49.252
TRAVIS: I have a very large bronze
pot in the bag of holding.

00:36:49.252 --> 00:36:51.094
Could I wear that on me noggin?

00:36:51.094 --> 00:36:52.645
TALIESIN: If you like.

00:36:52.645 --> 00:36:55.249
MATT: It gives you a look in response and says,

00:36:55.249 --> 00:36:59.416
"This protects me from the
influence of the hive mind,

00:37:00.519 --> 00:37:02.852
"my preexisting connection."

00:37:05.293 --> 00:37:07.040
TALIESIN: Could we be hidden from them?

00:37:07.040 --> 00:37:08.236
Would there be a way

00:37:08.236 --> 00:37:10.890
to cloak ourselves from
their understanding?

00:37:10.890 --> 00:37:13.390
MATT: "Stay hidden from the others.

00:37:14.414 --> 00:37:17.081
"Their sight is the mind's sight.

00:37:18.655 --> 00:37:22.822
"The Elder Brain is a collection of
the once living mind flayers

00:37:24.311 --> 00:37:25.394
"of my people."

00:37:26.331 --> 00:37:29.257
LIAM: I have one more question,

00:37:29.257 --> 00:37:32.635
and we have allied ourselves
to you, that's true.

00:37:32.635 --> 00:37:36.802
But I'm curious to know,
hopefully our goals intertwine,

00:37:38.149 --> 00:37:39.717
and we want the same thing.

00:37:39.717 --> 00:37:43.476
But once that is achieved, and it will be,

00:37:43.476 --> 00:37:46.393
what happens then for the Illithid?

00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:50.030
Do you return to your home below?

00:37:52.984 --> 00:37:55.317
Do your people harbor any

00:37:57.158 --> 00:37:58.325
ambition to

00:38:00.969 --> 00:38:03.302
move upward into Kraghammer?

00:38:05.121 --> 00:38:08.673
MATT: It looks to the side and says,

00:38:08.673 --> 00:38:12.256
"Our ambition is to
pursue the continuation

00:38:13.519 --> 00:38:17.410
"of our knowledge-seeking.

00:38:17.410 --> 00:38:20.964
"We have no interest in the surface.

00:38:20.964 --> 00:38:24.964
"We only wish to spread
our dominion here below.

00:38:26.813 --> 00:38:29.813
"Expand our great city of Yug'Voril."

00:38:31.211 --> 00:38:33.058
LIAM: I'm sorry, what was that name?

00:38:33.058 --> 00:38:34.141
MATT: "Yug'Voril."

00:38:36.568 --> 00:38:38.819
ORION: Sounds like a lovely town, Yug'Voril.

00:38:38.819 --> 00:38:40.236
MATT: "It's beautiful."

00:38:41.105 --> 00:38:44.938
TALIESIN: I feel that we could
come to an arrangement.

00:38:45.999 --> 00:38:47.365
LIAM: I do as well.

00:38:47.365 --> 00:38:50.582
TALIESIN: We would require of
you, at the very least,

00:38:50.582 --> 00:38:52.738
safe passage once we have helped you

00:38:52.738 --> 00:38:55.108
reunite with your people, for ourselves,

00:38:55.108 --> 00:38:59.392
and for a friend of ours
who's lost in the darkness,

00:38:59.392 --> 00:39:01.725
who we are here to retrieve.

00:39:02.964 --> 00:39:07.131
MATT: "For this deed, of freeing
my people from this

00:39:10.687 --> 00:39:13.437
"insidious presence that is K'varn..."

00:39:15.046 --> 00:39:17.866
TALIESIN: Freeing all of our people.

00:39:17.866 --> 00:39:20.783
MATT: "I believe this could be arranged."

00:39:21.857 --> 00:39:24.357
LIAM: Scanlan, does he speak true?

00:39:25.424 --> 00:39:27.327
SAM: Uh.

00:39:27.327 --> 00:39:28.463
Let's find out.

00:39:28.463 --> 00:39:29.818
(all laugh)

00:39:29.818 --> 00:39:32.524
SAM: I'm gonna just see if
I can detect any lies.

00:39:32.524 --> 00:39:35.607
MATT: Go ahead and make an insight check.

00:39:36.451 --> 00:39:37.915
SAM: What am I adding to this?

00:39:37.915 --> 00:39:38.748
LIAM: Insight.

00:39:39.639 --> 00:39:40.996
SAM: Oh.

00:39:40.996 --> 00:39:42.602
13.

00:39:42.602 --> 00:39:44.422
I'm not an insight person.

00:39:44.422 --> 00:39:45.375
ASHLEY: Oh, can I--

00:39:45.375 --> 00:39:46.421
TRAVIS: (scoffs)

00:39:46.421 --> 00:39:47.626
LIAM: 20 over here!

00:39:47.626 --> 00:39:49.078
TALIESIN: What are you doing?

00:39:49.078 --> 00:39:50.405
TRAVIS: She's rolled twice.

00:39:50.405 --> 00:39:51.747
ASHLEY: Assisting, assisting.

00:39:51.747 --> 00:39:52.536
(all laugh)

00:39:52.536 --> 00:39:54.416
TALIESIN: All of your 20's,
running out.

00:39:54.416 --> 00:39:57.228
MATT: It's too late for the assist, 
unfortunately, 'cause it's already rolled.

00:39:57.228 --> 00:39:58.774
LIAM: But can she suss him out?

00:39:58.774 --> 00:40:03.041
MATT: Best you can tell, those
who are looking into it,

00:40:03.041 --> 00:40:06.988
he seems to be speaking
from a point of desperation,

00:40:06.988 --> 00:40:09.425
and intent, as he has no other option.

00:40:10.340 --> 00:40:12.105
He is genuinely--

00:40:12.105 --> 00:40:13.886
You can see it in the way he talks,

00:40:13.886 --> 00:40:16.480
and the way he speaks about his family.

00:40:16.480 --> 00:40:18.669
He's a little crazy.

00:40:18.669 --> 00:40:21.184
The isolation has put him to a point

00:40:21.184 --> 00:40:24.472
where he wants to return to his people,

00:40:24.472 --> 00:40:27.695
and will do whatever it
takes to get back with them,

00:40:27.695 --> 00:40:30.112
however, he also seems to be,

00:40:31.004 --> 00:40:33.746
in a weird way that you can read,

00:40:33.746 --> 00:40:36.324
appreciative that you're willing to help,

00:40:36.324 --> 00:40:39.491
and seems to be, on his part, genuine.

00:40:42.549 --> 00:40:44.112
As a note, music's not playing?

00:40:44.112 --> 00:40:46.259
I don't know if there's a reason for that.

00:40:46.259 --> 00:40:49.566
TRAVIS: Did he say his eyes, the flayer's eyes,

00:40:49.566 --> 00:40:52.263
are what put people in
trances, or their minds?

00:40:52.263 --> 00:40:53.681
SAM: Yeah, the eyes, the eyes.

00:40:53.681 --> 00:40:55.845
TRAVIS: So if we wear helmets,
it's not gonna help us.

00:40:55.845 --> 00:40:58.572
SAM: No, the helmet is what separates
him from his hive mind.

00:40:58.572 --> 00:40:59.837
It wouldn't help us at all.

00:40:59.837 --> 00:41:01.685
TRAVIS: I'll still wear the big
bronze pot on my head.

00:41:01.685 --> 00:41:03.888
MATT: You put the pot on your head.
It's clunky.

00:41:03.888 --> 00:41:04.976
TRAVIS: On my whole head.

00:41:04.976 --> 00:41:06.402
MATT: You cannot see with the pot on your head.

00:41:06.402 --> 00:41:08.314
TRAVIS: No, but I'm protected from the flayer.

00:41:08.314 --> 00:41:10.437
SAM: Can you bore two like, ghost holes in?

00:41:10.437 --> 00:41:13.642
TRAVIS: I don't need it, I have
incredible warrior skills.

00:41:13.642 --> 00:41:17.280
TALIESIN: Do their powers work with reflection?

00:41:17.280 --> 00:41:20.413
MATT: "No, they can peer into your very mind."

00:41:22.836 --> 00:41:27.198
TALIESIN: But if we approach them
using a reflective surface

00:41:27.198 --> 00:41:29.823
to view them, can they peer into our minds

00:41:29.823 --> 00:41:31.707
through a reflected surface?

00:41:31.707 --> 00:41:34.714
MATT: "If they know you're
there, you're in sight,

00:41:34.714 --> 00:41:36.545
"they can read into you."

00:41:36.545 --> 00:41:37.378
TRAVIS: Shit.

00:41:38.531 --> 00:41:39.979
MARISHA: They can read our minds.

00:41:39.979 --> 00:41:44.146
MATT: "If you are obscured, unknown to
them, then you are hidden.

00:41:45.355 --> 00:41:50.039
"They cannot sense you, but
if they know you are there,

00:41:50.039 --> 00:41:52.372
"they can peer, they can pry."

00:41:53.957 --> 00:41:57.788
LIAM: Is there any way to be hidden for us?

00:41:57.788 --> 00:41:59.455
MATT: "Hidden from sight.

00:42:00.929 --> 00:42:03.556
"Be hidden from knowledge.

00:42:03.556 --> 00:42:05.223
"Be hidden from them."

00:42:09.445 --> 00:42:10.857
MARISHA: Clarence?

00:42:10.857 --> 00:42:12.327
Sorry, Clarota.

00:42:12.327 --> 00:42:13.744
SAM: How about Clay?

00:42:14.604 --> 00:42:16.524
MATT: "Clarota!"

00:42:17.264 --> 00:42:18.323
TRAVIS: Jesus.

00:42:18.323 --> 00:42:20.233
MARISHA: Sorry, Clarota.

00:42:20.233 --> 00:42:22.816
I just have one quick question.

00:42:23.974 --> 00:42:27.265
Why would you want to rejoin your colony

00:42:27.265 --> 00:42:29.515
after they've banished you?

00:42:30.391 --> 00:42:31.558
Why not leave?

00:42:32.458 --> 00:42:34.717
MATT: "I have nowhere to go.

00:42:34.717 --> 00:42:38.085
"They are my essence, my connection.

00:42:38.085 --> 00:42:39.502
"I long to return.

00:42:40.555 --> 00:42:43.223
"It is the way of my people,

00:42:43.223 --> 00:42:46.052
"I understand this curse I hold.

00:42:46.052 --> 00:42:50.999
"I spite myself, I look upon this disease,
and spit.

00:42:50.999 --> 00:42:52.711
"But perhaps,

00:42:54.480 --> 00:42:57.563
"with this deed, they can overlook it."

00:42:59.102 --> 00:43:01.670
MARISHA: You're not diseased, you're special.

00:43:01.670 --> 00:43:02.503
TRAVIS: Oh, God.

00:43:04.793 --> 00:43:05.964
SAM: Question, Clarota.

00:43:05.964 --> 00:43:08.714
MATT: "You know nothing of my culture.

00:43:10.436 --> 00:43:12.186
"You presume too much."

00:43:16.159 --> 00:43:20.836
LIAM: I think we do understand
your desires though,

00:43:20.836 --> 00:43:23.926
and we can align ours with yours.

00:43:23.926 --> 00:43:27.563
So let us speak of specifics, Clarota.

00:43:27.563 --> 00:43:28.396
SAM: Strategy.

00:43:28.396 --> 00:43:30.041
LIAM: Strategy.

00:43:30.041 --> 00:43:32.958
SAM: Number one, that assortment of

00:43:34.088 --> 00:43:36.912
dwarves and some of your friends

00:43:36.912 --> 00:43:39.519
and ogres over there on the
other side of the chasm.

00:43:39.519 --> 00:43:42.104
Is that something that we
need to face headlong,

00:43:42.104 --> 00:43:44.087
or can we maybe surpass them,

00:43:44.087 --> 00:43:48.254
trying to find K'varn, or this
temple that you speak of?

00:43:49.726 --> 00:43:51.476
MATT: "We may if you wish.

00:43:52.461 --> 00:43:54.628
"Their stronghold is far below.

00:43:57.288 --> 00:44:00.378

"Perhaps the general can be
pried for information.

"If you bring him to me."

00:44:26.488 --> 00:44:30.154
SAM: "Bring him," so you won't be 
accompanying us on any adventure, or...?

00:44:30.154 --> 00:44:31.716
MATT: "I will be coming."

00:44:33.709 --> 00:44:35.074
ORION: We have to fetch him.

00:44:35.074 --> 00:44:37.317
SAM: And the general is in that...

00:44:37.317 --> 00:44:38.822
ORION: Where you were, right?

00:44:38.822 --> 00:44:39.722
SAM: Yes, yes.

00:44:39.722 --> 00:44:41.718
So we have to go over.

00:44:41.718 --> 00:44:44.623
ASHLEY: Did you say something about a temple,

00:44:44.623 --> 00:44:46.607
or did I completely misunderstand?

00:44:46.607 --> 00:44:49.599
MATT: "There is a temple in our city.

00:44:49.599 --> 00:44:53.766
"Where my people reside, that
is where the Elder Brain sits."

00:44:55.554 --> 00:44:56.984
SAM: We'll get there eventually,

00:44:56.984 --> 00:44:59.997
but first step is this smaller
force across the chasm.

00:44:59.997 --> 00:45:02.007
TRAVIS: Yeah, we're gonna put the beat down.

00:45:02.007 --> 00:45:03.514
(all laugh)

00:45:03.514 --> 00:45:05.701
ORION: Well said, Grog.

00:45:05.701 --> 00:45:07.901
MARISHA: You said there was a big army front,

00:45:07.901 --> 00:45:09.609
guarding this general?

00:45:09.609 --> 00:45:10.863
Of duergar?

00:45:10.863 --> 00:45:13.659
SAM: Well, the general's right across the chasm.

00:45:13.659 --> 00:45:16.429
MARISHA: Oh, he's just right across the way?

00:45:16.429 --> 00:45:19.390
MATT: "Their forces are gathering there.
The bulk of their army

00:45:19.390 --> 00:45:23.547
"currently is divided between that
and the stronghold below."

00:45:24.273 --> 00:45:26.530
LIAM: Percy shot this one, I think.

00:45:26.530 --> 00:45:27.376
TALIESIN: I did.

00:45:27.376 --> 00:45:29.018
LIAM: I think it's important to point out

00:45:29.018 --> 00:45:31.975
that your kin, this general,

00:45:31.975 --> 00:45:34.144
is aware of at least three of us,

00:45:34.144 --> 00:45:38.311
of my dragonborn friend, the
singer over here, and myself.

00:45:39.636 --> 00:45:42.114
SAM: I don't think he knows about me.

00:45:42.114 --> 00:45:44.664
TRAVIS: No, you were invisible.
LIAM: Just us, then.

00:45:44.664 --> 00:45:46.361
ORION: I don't even know if he saw me.

00:45:46.361 --> 00:45:48.118
He saw my funny cards.

00:45:48.118 --> 00:45:50.868
LIAM: True, it could be just me then.

00:45:52.387 --> 00:45:55.990
ORION: Oh, I cast Prestidigitation on Pike
and I clean her up real quick.

00:45:56.952 --> 00:45:58.970
LIAM: You look lovely.

00:45:58.970 --> 00:46:02.771
How do you think your
kin will react to that?

00:46:02.771 --> 00:46:06.463
What will their response be
if they know that outsiders have come?

00:46:06.463 --> 00:46:08.616
If they've seen just me at this moment,

00:46:08.616 --> 00:46:10.533
plus a few illusions.

00:46:11.806 --> 00:46:14.161
MATT: "They will be prepared.

00:46:14.161 --> 00:46:16.828
"So you must find another way in.

00:46:19.017 --> 00:46:22.830
"You must think how to not be seen."

00:46:24.102 --> 00:46:25.145
TRAVIS: Think.

00:46:25.145 --> 00:46:26.658
(all laugh)

00:46:26.658 --> 00:46:28.325
ORION: Don't worry, Grog.

00:46:29.225 --> 00:46:31.138
MATT: You've never ever, in your life,

00:46:31.138 --> 00:46:35.614
ever heard someone else
chuckle inside your brain,

00:46:35.614 --> 00:46:37.675
but you hear within the center of yours:

00:46:37.675 --> 00:46:42.742
(chuckles) "Think, yes."

00:46:42.742 --> 00:46:44.881
TRAVIS: Oh ho, it echoes in the pot.

00:46:44.881 --> 00:46:47.082
(all laugh)

00:46:47.082 --> 00:46:49.666
But I start laughing to myself.
(silly laughter)

00:46:50.605 --> 00:46:52.987
LIAM: Can I assume that you
would have already given us

00:46:52.987 --> 00:46:55.987
any advice by now if you knew a way?

00:46:57.736 --> 00:47:00.736
Are we stuck with our own resources?

00:47:01.627 --> 00:47:04.240
MATT: "I've only watched from a distance.

00:47:04.240 --> 00:47:06.862
"Getting too close was too dangerous.

00:47:06.862 --> 00:47:09.279
"I only read surface thoughts.

00:47:10.214 --> 00:47:13.047
"If I were seen, I would be nothing,

00:47:13.939 --> 00:47:16.288
"I would be destroyed."

00:47:16.288 --> 00:47:18.838
LIAM: So no back doors, no secret
entrances that you know of,

00:47:18.838 --> 00:47:20.858
into the camp, anywhere near this general?

00:47:20.858 --> 00:47:22.909
MATT: "None."

00:47:22.909 --> 00:47:25.147
LIAM: Fuck.

00:47:25.147 --> 00:47:27.483
TRAVIS: What's in the bottom of the crevasse?

00:47:27.483 --> 00:47:29.080
SAM: It's water and magma.

00:47:29.080 --> 00:47:30.572
TRAVIS: Can we pick up the little loch ness monster

00:47:30.572 --> 00:47:32.198
and throw it at him or something?

00:47:32.198 --> 00:47:36.265
SAM: Oh yes, down below, in the waters,

00:47:36.265 --> 00:47:38.828
our allies - Vex, and uh, somebody.

00:47:39.278 --> 00:47:41.144
(all laugh)

00:47:41.144 --> 00:47:43.778
Found some creatures under the water,

00:47:43.778 --> 00:47:46.278
snatching bodies as they fell.

00:47:47.168 --> 00:47:48.001
Keyleth.

00:47:48.001 --> 00:47:49.575
Yes, I forgot who went.

00:47:49.575 --> 00:47:51.105
ORION: Her majesty, Keyleth.

00:47:51.105 --> 00:47:53.344
SAM: Pike's beauty distracted me,

00:47:53.344 --> 00:47:55.513
you shouldn't have cleaned her up so nice.

00:47:55.513 --> 00:47:56.903
ORION: I'm sorry.

00:47:56.903 --> 00:47:58.839
SAM: Anyway, there were some creatures

00:47:58.839 --> 00:48:00.254
down below in the waters,

00:48:00.254 --> 00:48:02.162
are those anything that we could use,

00:48:02.162 --> 00:48:03.914
or should we just avoid them?

00:48:03.914 --> 00:48:05.768
MATT: You see it actually hisses for a second,

00:48:05.768 --> 00:48:07.532
as soon as you mention this he goes,

00:48:07.532 --> 00:48:08.449
"No, avoid.

00:48:08.449 --> 00:48:11.155
"That creature is older than all of us.

00:48:11.155 --> 00:48:13.738
"It resides there, an ancient mind.

00:48:15.197 --> 00:48:17.030
"One that should be

00:48:18.626 --> 00:48:19.626
"Kept at bay.

00:48:19.626 --> 00:48:22.397
"An aboleth."

00:48:22.397 --> 00:48:24.107
SAM: Do you need a lozenge?

00:48:24.107 --> 00:48:26.720
(all laugh)

00:48:26.720 --> 00:48:28.050
MATT: Its eyes narrow once again,

00:48:28.050 --> 00:48:30.720
not quite understanding the words you use,

00:48:30.720 --> 00:48:31.880
seemingly amused.

00:48:31.880 --> 00:48:33.477
SAM: It's a gnome thing.

00:48:33.477 --> 00:48:34.359
MATT: As a brief aside, too,

00:48:34.359 --> 00:48:36.293
I checked the connection on my iPad,

00:48:36.293 --> 00:48:38.382
I'm playing music fine, and
the connection's in the iPad,

00:48:38.382 --> 00:48:40.253
I don't quite know where
it's losing its connection.

00:48:40.253 --> 00:48:43.086
But I think we need some music.

00:48:44.415 --> 00:48:46.620
SAM: All right, so let's review
our options, shall we?

00:48:46.620 --> 00:48:48.001
TRAVIS: We're gonna charge in there.

00:48:48.001 --> 00:48:50.316
SAM: We can't charge, there's a chasm.

00:48:50.316 --> 00:48:51.764
LIAM: How did that go with
the little brain thing?

00:48:51.764 --> 00:48:52.736
Not too well.

00:48:52.736 --> 00:48:55.307
TALIESIN: The chasm is a problem.

00:48:55.307 --> 00:48:56.474
SAM: Master switch.

00:48:59.832 --> 00:49:02.656
MARISHA: An entire colony of mind flayers.

00:49:02.656 --> 00:49:04.754
SAM: We could fly in, right?

00:49:04.754 --> 00:49:06.771
LIAM: The bridge is gone, we have to--

00:49:06.771 --> 00:49:10.018
SAM: We can fly in death from above.

00:49:10.018 --> 00:49:11.461
TRAVIS: I don't know if I can.

00:49:11.461 --> 00:49:13.260
SAM: Well, we can figure out a way.

00:49:13.260 --> 00:49:15.274
Enough of us can turn into flying things

00:49:15.274 --> 00:49:16.121
to get you there.

00:49:16.121 --> 00:49:17.092
TALIESIN: We also have a flying carpet.

00:49:17.092 --> 00:49:18.541
We can repair the bridge if we had to,

00:49:18.541 --> 00:49:20.525
at least put a rope across.

00:49:20.525 --> 00:49:21.525
ASHLEY: I think--

00:49:24.583 --> 00:49:27.140
SAM: Or we could disguise ourselves somehow.

00:49:27.140 --> 00:49:29.529
ASHLEY: I think I know where we need to go.

00:49:29.529 --> 00:49:30.538
SAM: What?

00:49:30.538 --> 00:49:31.371
TRAVIS: Really?

00:49:32.482 --> 00:49:33.315
MARISHA: Really?

00:49:34.225 --> 00:49:36.142
LIAM: Get out of this city.

00:49:37.265 --> 00:49:38.729
MARISHA: Please, do tell.

00:49:38.729 --> 00:49:39.627
SAM: So, hold on--

00:49:39.627 --> 00:49:42.321
(static)

00:49:42.321 --> 00:49:44.721
(music)

00:49:44.721 --> 00:49:45.654
MATT: There we go.

00:49:45.654 --> 00:49:46.987
SAM: There's music.

00:49:56.183 --> 00:49:58.174
ASHLEY: Oh wait, I think I read this wrong.

00:49:58.174 --> 00:50:00.037
(all laugh)

00:50:00.037 --> 00:50:01.867
SAM: Pike, don't toy with our emotions.

00:50:01.867 --> 00:50:03.253
TRAVIS: You just got back.

00:50:03.253 --> 00:50:05.250
ASHLEY: So you guys haven't gone to the war camp.

00:50:05.250 --> 00:50:06.083
SAM: We have.

00:50:06.083 --> 00:50:07.052
ASHLEY: You have.

00:50:07.052 --> 00:50:08.697
SAM: We been there and we quickly retreated.

00:50:08.697 --> 00:50:11.232
LIAM: Scanlan took a poke about.

00:50:11.232 --> 00:50:15.094
He boofed himself out of sight
and had a look around,

00:50:15.094 --> 00:50:17.706
and then we returned to the edge of it,

00:50:17.706 --> 00:50:19.668
and I kind of flipped the bird at them,

00:50:19.668 --> 00:50:20.850
and taunted them a little,

00:50:20.850 --> 00:50:24.092
but most of us haven't been in.

00:50:24.092 --> 00:50:25.851
ASHLEY: Have you been to the lake?

00:50:25.851 --> 00:50:27.774
TRAVIS: None of us went in the water.

00:50:27.774 --> 00:50:28.648
SAM: Lake?

00:50:28.648 --> 00:50:30.663
No, there's no-- what, there's a lake?

00:50:30.663 --> 00:50:32.579
ASHLEY: Isn't that where that thing is?

00:50:32.579 --> 00:50:34.656
TRAVIS: The bottom of the crevasse, right?

00:50:34.656 --> 00:50:36.363
LIAM: Under the bridge, there was--

00:50:36.363 --> 00:50:38.548
SAM: No, that's rushing water, that's not--

00:50:38.548 --> 00:50:41.302
MATT: The area after the big drop
that was at the bottom,

00:50:41.302 --> 00:50:42.645
there was a lake of water.

00:50:42.645 --> 00:50:44.923
And there was a waterfall
coming out of the natural--

00:50:44.923 --> 00:50:48.072
LIAM: And the ogres were getting
sucked under by something.

00:50:48.072 --> 00:50:50.046
TRAVIS: So we didn't go down there.

00:50:50.046 --> 00:50:51.798
MARISHA: Is there something under the lake?

00:50:51.798 --> 00:50:53.131
ASHLEY: Well I just--

00:50:54.507 --> 00:50:56.082
I don't know if I should
be talking about this

00:50:56.082 --> 00:50:57.919
in front of him.

00:50:57.919 --> 00:51:00.941
TRAVIS: We could go away from him for a second.

00:51:00.941 --> 00:51:05.363
LIAM: He will probably hear the
thoughts inside your mind.

00:51:05.363 --> 00:51:09.245
ORION: Clarota is totally fine
to talk in front of. He's amazing.

00:51:09.245 --> 00:51:10.370
ASHLEY: Earmuffs.

00:51:10.370 --> 00:51:11.323
(all laugh)

00:51:14.381 --> 00:51:17.133
ASHLEY: Well, shall I share a vision I had?

00:51:17.133 --> 00:51:19.311
LIAM: I think so, Pike. I think at this point,

00:51:19.311 --> 00:51:21.983
we should just move forward.

00:51:21.983 --> 00:51:24.483
ASHLEY: In this vision that I had,

00:51:26.694 --> 00:51:29.611
I was pulled down toward the mines.

00:51:30.761 --> 00:51:35.195
Into the tunnels, below where
the dwarves were working.

00:51:35.195 --> 00:51:37.392
MARISHA: Through the lake?

00:51:37.392 --> 00:51:40.071
ASHLEY: Well, past the goblinoid creatures,

00:51:40.071 --> 00:51:42.904
and past a great underground lake.

00:51:46.037 --> 00:51:48.772
Past a jagged onyx colored fortress,

00:51:48.772 --> 00:51:50.040
framed in molten rock.

00:51:50.040 --> 00:51:51.910
TRAVIS: We haven't been there yet.

00:51:51.910 --> 00:51:54.877
ASHLEY: Past a field of broken glass and bone.

00:51:54.877 --> 00:51:56.214
Have you seen any of this?

00:51:56.214 --> 00:51:57.501
TALIESIN and MARISHA: No.

00:51:57.501 --> 00:51:59.367
TRAVIS: I don't think an onyx fortress.

00:51:59.367 --> 00:52:01.163
ORION: Those last things sound terrible.

00:52:01.163 --> 00:52:03.375
LIAM: Yes, that all sounds shitty.

00:52:03.375 --> 00:52:04.208
(all laugh)

00:52:04.208 --> 00:52:06.008
LIAM: The last thing we've seen is the lake,

00:52:06.008 --> 00:52:07.393
and we didn't go too close to it,

00:52:07.393 --> 00:52:10.365
because a couple of
ogres fell in from above,

00:52:10.365 --> 00:52:12.273
and they disappeared like
something grabbed them.

00:52:12.273 --> 00:52:14.660
TRAVIS: We didn't have him fly down there
and get a close look.

00:52:14.660 --> 00:52:16.708
LIAM: No, we haven't had a look around.

00:52:16.708 --> 00:52:18.405
ASHLEY: I wonder if there's like--

00:52:18.405 --> 00:52:20.716
MARISHA: I can cast Water Breathing on all of us.

00:52:20.716 --> 00:52:23.417
TRAVIS: Why don't we send one,
like Mars Rover over here,

00:52:23.417 --> 00:52:25.264
and have him go check it out?

00:52:25.264 --> 00:52:28.431
MARISHA: I can always turn into, like, a whale.

00:52:29.026 --> 00:52:31.650
LIAM: Perhaps, but the water
breathing sounds good to me.

00:52:31.650 --> 00:52:33.484
I feel like a head-on--

00:52:33.484 --> 00:52:35.978
TRAVIS: Isn't there something in the water?

00:52:35.978 --> 00:52:37.561
LIAM: -- run into the chasm is a bad idea.

00:52:37.561 --> 00:52:39.707
ORION: I pull out my empty bottle,

00:52:39.707 --> 00:52:40.932
and I go, and I have this!

00:52:40.932 --> 00:52:42.618
LIAM: Yes, he's got a bottle, plus,

00:52:42.618 --> 00:52:44.503
we've killed a fucking dragon.

00:52:44.503 --> 00:52:48.421
I know it's not an easy
task to accomplish,

00:52:48.421 --> 00:52:50.483
but we're pretty badass, I think.

00:52:50.483 --> 00:52:51.982
We might have a good chance.

00:52:51.982 --> 00:52:56.476
MARISHA: So wait, is going through the lake gonna
get us through to the general?

00:52:56.476 --> 00:52:57.917
LIAM: Well, we don't know.

00:52:57.917 --> 00:53:00.214
TRAVIS: We haven't been down
to the water's surface.

00:53:00.214 --> 00:53:01.555
SAM: What's the best-case scenario?

00:53:01.555 --> 00:53:02.991
What, we come up behind them?

00:53:02.991 --> 00:53:04.610
It's still gonna be a fight.

00:53:04.610 --> 00:53:07.735
TRAVIS: But maybe there's a
different vantage point.

00:53:07.735 --> 00:53:09.051
SAM: We can fly over them,

00:53:09.051 --> 00:53:10.952
that seems like a pretty
good attack point.

00:53:10.952 --> 00:53:12.732
TALIESIN: Some of us can fly over them.

00:53:12.732 --> 00:53:14.924
MARISHA: Well we can figure out
to where where all of us can fly over them.

00:53:14.924 --> 00:53:17.451
I'm more concerned about us cloaking ourselves.

00:53:17.451 --> 00:53:19.443
Even if we're flying they're still
going to see us.

00:53:19.443 --> 00:53:21.602
SAM: There's an ancient death thing down there.

00:53:21.602 --> 00:53:23.549
TRAVIS: He might die, didn't say it was foolproof.

00:53:23.549 --> 00:53:25.366
SAM: I don't know, man, he's volunteering you.

00:53:25.366 --> 00:53:27.820
ORION: Wait, what's going on?

00:53:27.820 --> 00:53:29.160
LIAM: I mean, our options are:
we can vote on it,

00:53:29.160 --> 00:53:30.678
although we all know Keyleth is just

00:53:30.678 --> 00:53:32.592
gonna go fucking do whatever she wants.

00:53:32.592 --> 00:53:34.733
Our options are--

00:53:34.733 --> 00:53:36.410
MARISHA: That was one time.

00:53:36.410 --> 00:53:37.523
LIAM: Just the one time.

00:53:37.523 --> 00:53:38.377
MARISHA: Just one time.

00:53:38.377 --> 00:53:39.475
TRAVIS: Never to be forgotten.

00:53:39.475 --> 00:53:41.341
LIAM: Our options are a headlong advance

00:53:41.341 --> 00:53:43.560
into the middle of their camp.

00:53:43.560 --> 00:53:45.385
That's a big fucking force.

00:53:45.385 --> 00:53:48.077
SAM: Or some sort of disguise, distraction.

00:53:48.077 --> 00:53:48.910
TRAVIS: Tiberius.

00:53:48.910 --> 00:53:50.349
MATT: Is the stream down by the way?

00:53:50.349 --> 00:53:51.801
ZAC: It goes down every two hours

00:53:51.801 --> 00:53:53.609
and 17 minutes, it's
been doing that for--

00:53:53.609 --> 00:53:54.957
It comes right back up.

00:53:54.957 --> 00:53:57.094
MATT: All right, so let us know when it's back up.

00:53:57.094 --> 00:53:59.480
SAM: Two hours and 17 minutes,
that sounds like Lost or something.

00:53:59.480 --> 00:54:00.397
TRAVIS: Tiberius.

00:54:00.397 --> 00:54:01.338
Do it.

00:54:01.338 --> 00:54:03.087
MARISHA: Amityville Twitch stream.

00:54:03.087 --> 00:54:05.560
TRAVIS: Go fly all the way down
to the water's surface.

00:54:05.560 --> 00:54:09.023
Like Michael J. Fox in
Back to the Future 2,

00:54:09.023 --> 00:54:12.106
and check out if there's any other tunnels

00:54:12.106 --> 00:54:13.909
that we haven't seen, or ways to go.

00:54:13.909 --> 00:54:16.241
ORION: Isn't this the same water that you bended?
MARISHA: I think so.

00:54:16.241 --> 00:54:18.709
TRAVIS: We didn't go down to the
water's surface though, did we?

00:54:18.709 --> 00:54:20.354
MARISHA: Well, we went over the top of it,

00:54:20.354 --> 00:54:21.840
and kind of looked down.

00:54:21.840 --> 00:54:22.940
TRAVIS: Oh, we did? We went all the way down?

00:54:22.940 --> 00:54:24.706
MARISHA: When I was bending the water back,

00:54:24.706 --> 00:54:27.101
we were kind of in that area, right?

00:54:27.101 --> 00:54:28.794
That was that area, but the lake--

00:54:28.794 --> 00:54:30.514
SAM: Do it smart.

00:54:30.514 --> 00:54:32.252
Let's go bomb them.

00:54:32.252 --> 00:54:33.700
ASHLEY: What if, I mean--

00:54:33.700 --> 00:54:34.923
TRAVIS: Can you freeze it?

00:54:34.923 --> 00:54:37.348
ASHLEY: Do you guys wanna like,
put me down on a rope,

00:54:37.348 --> 00:54:42.288
and I can just run around,
see if there's any openings?

00:54:42.288 --> 00:54:43.360
I mean I have a lot of armor.

00:54:43.360 --> 00:54:44.537
LIAM: Go fishing with you?

00:54:44.537 --> 00:54:45.956
MARISHA: Go fishing, yeah.

00:54:45.956 --> 00:54:47.542
ASHLEY: Well no, just like halfway,

00:54:47.542 --> 00:54:49.709
and then I can run around
and look for tunnels.

00:54:49.709 --> 00:54:51.598
Well some of us can fly, so we're okay.

00:54:51.598 --> 00:54:54.307
MARISHA: I can attempt to try and
drain the lake a little bit.

00:54:54.307 --> 00:54:57.112
LIAM: And Keyleth said that she
can cast Water Breathing,

00:54:57.112 --> 00:54:58.966
can help us breathe
underneath the surface.

00:54:58.966 --> 00:55:00.340
TRAVIS: We have two underwater breathing potions.

00:55:00.340 --> 00:55:01.657
MARISHA: Control Water's a level five spell.

00:55:01.657 --> 00:55:03.291
MATT: I realize that.
But that's a lot of water.

00:55:03.291 --> 00:55:04.944
TRAVIS: But remember, we're
slow as balls in water.

00:55:04.944 --> 00:55:06.752
LIAM: You were having trouble, if I recall,

00:55:06.752 --> 00:55:08.912
just getting the waterfall
out of the way to create,

00:55:08.912 --> 00:55:10.443
I mean it was amazing, but--

00:55:10.443 --> 00:55:11.475
MARISHA: I managed to get it stopped--

00:55:11.475 --> 00:55:13.330
LIAM: I know, you fucking saved the day,

00:55:13.330 --> 00:55:14.714
but we're talking about--

00:55:14.714 --> 00:55:15.557
MARISHA: A lake.

00:55:15.557 --> 00:55:16.873
LIAM: Yeah, Lake Superior.

00:55:16.873 --> 00:55:17.995
SAM: This is not just a lake,

00:55:17.995 --> 00:55:19.976
there is a death monster in there.

00:55:19.976 --> 00:55:22.165
If we go under the water, we're dead.

00:55:22.165 --> 00:55:23.348
TRAVIS: Can we stand on it?

00:55:23.348 --> 00:55:24.671
Anything, if we wanna fight it?

00:55:24.671 --> 00:55:26.502
Or are we gonna be
fighting it in the water?

00:55:26.502 --> 00:55:28.248
TALIESIN: Well, we can all have Water Breathing.

00:55:28.248 --> 00:55:29.469
TRAVIS: Yeah, but we'll be slow.

00:55:29.469 --> 00:55:32.025
SAM: And we'll be underwater,
where there's a death monster.

00:55:32.025 --> 00:55:34.009
TRAVIS: I'm not worried about
that part of the question.

00:55:34.009 --> 00:55:37.389
LIAM: There's 50 to 100 fucking creeps up top.

00:55:37.389 --> 00:55:39.706
SAM: Well, then let's come up with a good plan.

00:55:39.706 --> 00:55:42.011
ASHLEY: Maybe there's hidden stairs
or something,

00:55:42.011 --> 00:55:43.305
like in Indiana Jones?

00:55:43.305 --> 00:55:45.648
TRAVIS: Can you electrify the
water and fry the guy?

00:55:45.648 --> 00:55:47.247
LIAM: Hold up, hold up.

00:55:47.247 --> 00:55:49.344
ORION: There's only 26 people up there.

00:55:49.344 --> 00:55:51.359
On our last count.

00:55:51.359 --> 00:55:53.601
TALIESIN: Before the ones we killed, or after?
ORION: After.

00:55:53.601 --> 00:55:55.955
LIAM: Those are the ones we saw, though.

00:55:55.955 --> 00:55:57.936
How do we know how far back the camp goes?

00:55:57.936 --> 00:55:59.594
How many are in the gate behind it?

00:55:59.594 --> 00:56:01.809
TRAVIS: Don't a couple of you have Lightning?

00:56:01.809 --> 00:56:03.809
Can't you deep-fry the water?

00:56:04.652 --> 00:56:07.784
MARISHA: I mean, I can make a giant whirlpool.

00:56:07.784 --> 00:56:09.940
LIAM: Wait a second, wait a second.

00:56:09.940 --> 00:56:12.512
Clarota, you've been
listening to our thoughts

00:56:12.512 --> 00:56:14.057
for the last ten minutes.

00:56:14.057 --> 00:56:16.974
SAM: And what clear thoughts they have been.

00:56:16.974 --> 00:56:18.394
LIAM: What do you think?

00:56:18.964 --> 00:56:20.464
What do you think?

00:56:22.237 --> 00:56:25.221
MATT: "What resides in that lake is

00:56:25.221 --> 00:56:29.518
"something you wish not to tamper with.
An ancient mind."

00:56:29.518 --> 00:56:30.921
TRAVIS: Blah blah blah.

00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:33.454
Hodie-fucking-ho.

00:56:33.454 --> 00:56:36.753
MATT: "It clouds the water with its own filth.

00:56:36.753 --> 00:56:39.500
"You find yourself unable to breathe air."

00:56:39.500 --> 00:56:41.193
MARISHA: Didn't that happen already?

00:56:41.193 --> 00:56:43.326
MATT: "Its mind, it takes--"

00:56:43.326 --> 00:56:44.601
LIAM: Have you seen it?

00:56:44.601 --> 00:56:46.364
MATT: "Yes."

00:56:46.364 --> 00:56:47.520
LIAM: It's big?

00:56:47.520 --> 00:56:49.696
MATT: "It's rather large."

00:56:51.011 --> 00:56:54.391
ASHLEY: Is it like a many-armed

00:56:54.391 --> 00:56:55.801
...situation?

00:56:55.801 --> 00:56:57.819
(all laugh)

00:56:57.819 --> 00:56:59.486
MATT: "One could say, yes."

00:57:00.778 --> 00:57:01.778
ASHLEY: Okay. Swell.

00:57:02.828 --> 00:57:03.998
LIAM: What's the sitch?

00:57:03.998 --> 00:57:06.581
MARISHA: So we can face Cthulhu, or

00:57:08.719 --> 00:57:12.537
little Cthulhu minons,
seems to be our choice.

00:57:12.537 --> 00:57:13.370
ORION: Clarota.

00:57:13.370 --> 00:57:14.955
TRAVIS: Why don't I have Lightning, I swear.

00:57:14.955 --> 00:57:17.327
Can't you fry the water first?
See if it hurts it?

00:57:17.330 --> 00:57:20.060
SAM: We can fly overhead and just
Lightning the shit out of it.

00:57:20.060 --> 00:57:21.384
TRAVIS: Do that, please.

00:57:21.384 --> 00:57:23.514
'Cause maybe there's a
way-- there's a tunnel,

00:57:23.514 --> 00:57:25.322
and we come up behind
them or whatever it was.

00:57:25.322 --> 00:57:29.563
LIAM: That illithid took out my
brain from like 100 feet.

00:57:29.563 --> 00:57:32.267
SAM: You know what-- wait, wait, if I may.

00:57:32.267 --> 00:57:35.600
When I was there, I saw the main general

00:57:37.863 --> 00:57:39.870
control all of them instantly,

00:57:39.870 --> 00:57:42.196
when he was about to make
a sacrifice, or feed,

00:57:42.196 --> 00:57:44.212
or whatever he was doing.

00:57:44.212 --> 00:57:45.336
No offense.

00:57:45.336 --> 00:57:48.503
He instantly had all of their command.

00:57:49.425 --> 00:57:52.594
If we could somehow get to him, and

00:57:53.374 --> 00:57:55.565
cut off that connection, distract him,

00:57:55.565 --> 00:57:59.025
influence him somehow to
command them to all jump

00:57:59.025 --> 00:58:01.559
in the lake, for instance.

00:58:01.559 --> 00:58:04.110
That would get rid of a
lot of them all at once.

00:58:04.110 --> 00:58:06.376
LIAM: Can you make me invisible?

00:58:06.376 --> 00:58:08.116
SAM: I can get you there.

00:58:08.116 --> 00:58:11.834
I can make you unseeable,
but not invisible.

00:58:11.834 --> 00:58:12.805
LIAM: What?

00:58:12.805 --> 00:58:14.412
TRAVIS: What's the difference?

00:58:14.412 --> 00:58:16.085
SAM: I can make you a fly.

00:58:16.085 --> 00:58:18.397
TALIESIN: May I examine-- without removing--

00:58:18.397 --> 00:58:21.127
may I examine your device?

00:58:21.127 --> 00:58:21.960
TRAVIS: Oh, shit.

00:58:21.960 --> 00:58:23.122
MATT: Make a persuasion roll.

00:58:23.122 --> 00:58:24.609
TRAVIS: Oh man, Percy, Percy.

00:58:24.609 --> 00:58:26.718
SAM: What's he doing?

00:58:26.718 --> 00:58:27.831
ORION: He's asking to--

00:58:27.831 --> 00:58:28.664
TALIESIN: 16.

00:58:29.450 --> 00:58:30.987
LIAM: What's he doing?

00:58:30.987 --> 00:58:32.111
SAM: Touching the hat.

00:58:32.111 --> 00:58:34.548
MATT: He glares at you and says,

00:58:34.548 --> 00:58:38.715
"Our agreement does not
include this interaction."

00:58:41.144 --> 00:58:45.377
TALIESIN: It may be the key to
returning you to your people.

00:58:45.377 --> 00:58:46.699
TRAVIS: Tiberius.

00:58:46.699 --> 00:58:47.532
ORION: Yes?

00:58:47.532 --> 00:58:49.412
TRAVIS: Would you go fry the fucking lake?

00:58:49.412 --> 00:58:51.165
TALIESIN: I won't touch. I will just look.

00:58:52.226 --> 00:58:53.583
ORION: I'm reading my book.

00:58:53.583 --> 00:58:55.862
TRAVIS: No, I want you to--

00:58:55.862 --> 00:58:58.505
MATT: It kind of bows its head,
but does not move closer.

00:58:58.505 --> 00:59:02.205
It just slightly shows
you an element of it.

00:59:02.205 --> 00:59:05.743
TALIESIN: Can I understand how it functions?

00:59:05.743 --> 00:59:08.388
MATT: Best you can tell

00:59:08.388 --> 00:59:11.842
it looks like a skullcap
that's been kind of

00:59:11.842 --> 00:59:13.458
decently made for what it is,

00:59:13.458 --> 00:59:15.754
but you can see some of
the hammer marks on it,

00:59:15.754 --> 00:59:18.421
or whatever it was put together.

00:59:21.349 --> 00:59:25.516
It appears to be a very simple
piece of metallic material.

00:59:25.716 --> 00:59:27.002
TALIESIN: So it's magic.

00:59:27.002 --> 00:59:29.431
MATT: It looks like it is some
sort of enchantment,

00:59:29.431 --> 00:59:31.113
probably what's causing the effect.

00:59:31.113 --> 00:59:34.332
It's not any mechanical
device that causes it.

00:59:34.332 --> 00:59:36.866
TRAVIS: (metal clanging)

00:59:36.866 --> 00:59:39.963
TALIESIN: So there'd be no way to
build something to create a feedback loop?

00:59:42.072 --> 00:59:42.905
MARISHA: Ooh.

00:59:44.819 --> 00:59:46.271
I see what you're getting at.

00:59:46.271 --> 00:59:49.141
TALIESIN: I wanna try and see if there's any way
that I can take a look at this

00:59:49.141 --> 00:59:51.210
and figure out a way to build some sort

00:59:51.210 --> 00:59:52.404
of feedback system.

00:59:52.404 --> 00:59:54.022
MARISHA: We need to build a coconut radio.

00:59:54.022 --> 00:59:55.995
SAM: We don't even have a laboratory.

00:59:55.995 --> 00:59:58.398
TALIESIN: He wants a coconut radio.

00:59:58.398 --> 01:00:00.028
ORION: I love coconuts.

01:00:00.028 --> 01:00:02.887
MATT: You have never interacted with 
anything psionic-based before.

01:00:04.995 --> 01:00:06.545
The time to research that,

01:00:06.545 --> 01:00:09.781
and the materials needed
to do it would take months.

01:00:10.991 --> 01:00:11.991
TALIESIN: Plan two--

01:00:11.991 --> 01:00:14.154
LIAM: This is a fairly shitty situation.

01:00:14.154 --> 01:00:15.755
TRAVIS: While all this is going on!

01:00:15.755 --> 01:00:18.255
TALIESIN: Because if they can't see,

01:00:18.255 --> 01:00:19.255
what if we blind them?

01:00:19.255 --> 01:00:20.468
LIAM: How?

01:00:20.468 --> 01:00:22.276
MARISHA: With some sort of interference?

01:00:22.276 --> 01:00:24.735
TALIESIN: With a really bright light.

01:00:24.735 --> 01:00:26.850
ORION: Oh, I love doing light things.

01:00:26.850 --> 01:00:29.969
TALIESIN: What if they are so blind
they can't actually see us coming?

01:00:29.969 --> 01:00:32.918
MARISHA: I believe Pike and I both have
access to spells like that.

01:00:32.918 --> 01:00:35.403
SAM: I assume that would make
us pretty blind as well.

01:00:35.403 --> 01:00:37.280
MARISHA: Not necessarily.

01:00:37.280 --> 01:00:38.898
ASHLEY: Not if we wear our--

01:00:38.898 --> 01:00:40.634
SAM: -- sunglasses?

01:00:40.634 --> 01:00:42.371
(all laugh)

01:00:42.371 --> 01:00:44.698
TALIESIN: Can I attempt to build sunglasses?

01:00:44.698 --> 01:00:47.127
SAM: Before we build sunglasses--

01:00:47.127 --> 01:00:49.115
MATT: You can probably make a couple

01:00:49.115 --> 01:00:50.968
with the materials you have on hand.

01:00:50.968 --> 01:00:53.238
You are limited when
it comes to resources,

01:00:53.238 --> 01:00:55.320
as you are currently halfway underground.

01:00:55.320 --> 01:00:56.487
TALIESIN: Even better.

01:00:56.487 --> 01:00:58.795
TRAVIS: Vax could show his ass,
that's a pretty white light.

01:00:58.795 --> 01:01:00.233
TALIESIN: That's as white as it gets.

01:01:00.233 --> 01:01:02.030
LIAM: It's pale as shit. When I go to the beach,

01:01:02.030 --> 01:01:03.425
I don't tan, I stroke.

01:01:03.425 --> 01:01:06.234
SAM: But I thought we established that 
they don't need visual contact to influence us,

01:01:06.234 --> 01:01:08.567
they just need to be able to be aware--

01:01:08.567 --> 01:01:11.495
TALIESIN: Once they have visual contact
they can influence us,

01:01:11.495 --> 01:01:13.669
but they need to make that visual contact

01:01:13.669 --> 01:01:15.081
in the first place.

01:01:15.081 --> 01:01:17.664
MATT: "The dark, deep dwarves,

01:01:18.815 --> 01:01:21.948
"they hate light. This I know."

01:01:21.962 --> 01:01:23.839
MARISHA: I think it'll stun them long enough

01:01:23.839 --> 01:01:24.951
for us to get across.

01:01:24.951 --> 01:01:27.078
TALIESIN: If we could perhaps put some Light spells

01:01:27.078 --> 01:01:28.827
on the back and the front of our shields,

01:01:28.827 --> 01:01:31.038
so that we are guarded from it.

01:01:31.038 --> 01:01:33.779
ORION: If you can make a pair
for our friend here,

01:01:33.779 --> 01:01:35.451
that would help him out, I assume.

01:01:35.451 --> 01:01:37.580
MARISHA: Wait, that's not a bad idea.

01:01:37.580 --> 01:01:40.247
Pike, can we temporarily enchant

01:01:41.763 --> 01:01:45.125
the magic carpet as a spotlight

01:01:45.125 --> 01:01:46.375
as we fly over?

01:01:48.359 --> 01:01:50.109
As a light death ray?

01:01:51.386 --> 01:01:53.941
LIAM: We've seen you surrounded
in radiant light before,

01:01:53.941 --> 01:01:56.195
you think you can do that to the carpet?

01:01:56.195 --> 01:01:58.051
ASHLEY: I mean, I have--

01:01:58.051 --> 01:01:59.794
MARISHA: We should have Daylight.

01:01:59.794 --> 01:02:01.800
Where's my book?

01:02:01.800 --> 01:02:03.780
Where's my Player's Handbook?

01:02:03.780 --> 01:02:06.589
LIAM: And Clarota, while
they're figuring that out,

01:02:06.589 --> 01:02:10.589
if we remain to be hidden
or blind our opponents

01:02:11.450 --> 01:02:13.450
as we approach your kin,

01:02:14.341 --> 01:02:18.221
will not know our
thoughts 'til they see us?

01:02:18.221 --> 01:02:19.054
MATT: "Yes.

01:02:20.652 --> 01:02:24.819
"They need to look into you,
by knowing you're there."

01:02:27.462 --> 01:02:31.629
LIAM: Can I fight one of your
kin with a blindfold on?

01:02:33.381 --> 01:02:34.214
MATT: "Perhaps."

01:02:38.665 --> 01:02:40.144
TRAVIS: I thought if they could see you--

01:02:40.144 --> 01:02:40.977
ORION: Clarota.

01:02:41.991 --> 01:02:44.557
The mind hive that you possess,

01:02:44.557 --> 01:02:48.749
how close can one be
before it actually affects?

01:02:48.749 --> 01:02:51.813
Say 100 feet, caught my friend in mid air,

01:02:51.813 --> 01:02:53.146
alas, in their run-in.

01:02:54.291 --> 01:02:55.958
Is its range about--?

01:02:57.675 --> 01:02:59.832
MATT: "That's about the distance, yes."

01:03:02.900 --> 01:03:06.067
SAM: You may not know the answer to this.

01:03:07.067 --> 01:03:09.193
I don't doubt your knowledge and wisdom,

01:03:09.193 --> 01:03:13.227
but I happen to have a
ring with mind shielding,

01:03:13.227 --> 01:03:15.560
will that aid me in any way?

01:03:15.560 --> 01:03:16.875
MATT: "It may.

01:03:17.925 --> 01:03:21.285
"If it gives you resistance to psionic influence,

01:03:21.285 --> 01:03:24.742
"it would be of aid, yes."

01:03:25.739 --> 01:03:26.919
MARISHA: Daylight.

01:03:26.919 --> 01:03:28.339
TRAVIS: Do we have a plan?

01:03:29.269 --> 01:03:31.213
LIAM: It wouldn't be hard to get hold of

01:03:31.213 --> 01:03:34.182
some pitch down here, some tar.

01:03:34.182 --> 01:03:35.327
SAM: To burn?

01:03:35.327 --> 01:03:36.650
LIAM: No.

01:03:36.650 --> 01:03:38.231
If you can be invisible,

01:03:38.231 --> 01:03:40.523
and you have a ring of mind shielding,

01:03:40.523 --> 01:03:43.660
and you can carry a bucket of
pitch to that motherfucker,

01:03:43.660 --> 01:03:47.105
you can splash it on its
face, cover its eyes,

01:03:47.105 --> 01:03:48.544
and it's helpless.

01:03:49.384 --> 01:03:50.217
TALIESIN: My God.

01:03:50.217 --> 01:03:53.248
SAM: Or I can hang that big
brass pot on its head.

01:03:53.248 --> 01:03:54.900
TRAVIS: But I'm wearing that.

01:03:54.900 --> 01:03:57.740
LIAM: Yes, but it could take it off, possibly.

01:03:57.740 --> 01:03:59.650
If you smear sticky shit on its eyes--

01:03:59.650 --> 01:04:01.725
SAM: So wait, I just have to blind it?

01:04:01.725 --> 01:04:03.229
LIAM: Then it can't control--

01:04:03.229 --> 01:04:05.841
SAM: Well, I happen to have a Blindness spell!

01:04:05.841 --> 01:04:09.884
MATT: "It may still try, but to be blind,

01:04:09.884 --> 01:04:13.726
"it would be very difficult for it to pry
into your mind."

01:04:17.768 --> 01:04:20.539
SAM: Could it still control the others, though?

01:04:20.539 --> 01:04:21.997
MATT: "Probably.

01:04:21.997 --> 01:04:25.696
"That is a permanent enslavement."

01:04:25.696 --> 01:04:28.050
SAM: So you want me to go in there, solo,

01:04:28.050 --> 01:04:30.077
invisible, and try to blind this thing.

01:04:30.077 --> 01:04:31.070
LIAM: No, not solo.

01:04:31.070 --> 01:04:32.143
SAM: I'm in!

01:04:32.143 --> 01:04:35.947
LIAM: I like your idea of turning me into a fly.

01:04:35.947 --> 01:04:37.277
You and I go in--

01:04:37.277 --> 01:04:39.537
TALIESIN: And we've got Light spells.

01:04:39.537 --> 01:04:43.704
MARISHA: Pike and I can cast Daylight
on our magic carpet.

01:04:45.898 --> 01:04:48.402
ASHLEY: I can cast it onto my shield,

01:04:48.402 --> 01:04:51.943
and then on the carpet, and
we would have a double--

01:04:51.943 --> 01:04:53.483
MARISHA: I have to take a nap, though.

01:04:55.937 --> 01:04:56.770
What's that?

01:04:57.847 --> 01:05:00.117
LIAM: But that could get us in close.

01:05:00.117 --> 01:05:02.544
Scanlan and I could get in closer,

01:05:02.544 --> 01:05:05.942
and blind it, and I could
stab it in the head.

01:05:05.942 --> 01:05:08.583
MARISHA: I mean, technically I can also turn into 
something flying,

01:05:08.583 --> 01:05:10.562
I could back you guys up,

01:05:10.562 --> 01:05:12.998
if someone else wants to take the carpet.

01:05:12.998 --> 01:05:14.982
SAM: We can all get there.

01:05:14.982 --> 01:05:16.367
We can all get there.

01:05:16.367 --> 01:05:18.947
MARISHA: I can cast Daylight on your helmet.

01:05:18.947 --> 01:05:20.315
On your pot helmet.

01:05:20.315 --> 01:05:22.427
TRAVIS: Really?
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:05:22.427 --> 01:05:24.040
TRAVIS: That I'm game with

01:05:24.040 --> 01:05:25.311
MARISHA: All right.

01:05:25.311 --> 01:05:28.066
TRAVIS: I'll be like a lighthouse, walking around.

01:05:28.066 --> 01:05:29.488
Crushing life.

01:05:29.488 --> 01:05:30.488
(all laugh)

01:05:30.488 --> 01:05:33.122
MATT: You'd be the cover of 
John Carpenter's "The Thing."

01:05:33.122 --> 01:05:36.817
LIAM: Did everyone hear Percy,
that's a good idea.

01:05:36.817 --> 01:05:37.748
TALIESIN: Two fronts.

01:05:37.748 --> 01:05:39.033
LIAM: Yes, two fronts.

01:05:39.033 --> 01:05:39.866
SAM: What is it?

01:05:39.866 --> 01:05:41.822
LIAM: You and I separate from the group,

01:05:41.822 --> 01:05:43.910
they go in shining like a beacon,

01:05:43.910 --> 01:05:47.031
you and I (buzzes) in,

01:05:47.031 --> 01:05:50.870
and while the illithid is focused on them,

01:05:50.870 --> 01:05:54.337
we go in, you blind him,
and I stab him in his maw.

01:05:55.233 --> 01:05:56.139
It's pretty good.

01:05:56.139 --> 01:05:57.986
SAM: That's a suicide mission.

01:05:57.986 --> 01:05:59.771
TRAVIS: I like it, let's do it.

01:05:59.771 --> 01:06:01.720
LIAM: What else are we going to do?

01:06:01.720 --> 01:06:03.213
TALIESIN: I'm behind this plan.

01:06:03.213 --> 01:06:06.873
SAM: Surgical, special ops, seal team six.

01:06:06.873 --> 01:06:08.813
MARISHA: What does Vax have to say about this?

01:06:08.813 --> 01:06:10.932
LIAM: Vex, you mean? My sister Vex?

01:06:10.932 --> 01:06:11.765
MARISHA: Yes, that one.

01:06:11.765 --> 01:06:12.598
LIAM: That's a good question.

01:06:12.598 --> 01:06:14.221
SAM: Oh, Vex, you look so tired.

01:06:14.221 --> 01:06:16.438
MATT: Vex, your sister seems genuinely perturbed

01:06:16.438 --> 01:06:18.998
by the circumstance, but looks to you and says,

01:06:20.100 --> 01:06:23.785
"Look, I found him, you
deal with the situation.

01:06:23.785 --> 01:06:25.278
"Just tell me what to do."

01:06:25.278 --> 01:06:27.117
SAM: She's so like that.

01:06:27.117 --> 01:06:29.367
(all laugh)

01:06:31.847 --> 01:06:32.860
ASHLEY Let's do it.

01:06:32.860 --> 01:06:34.573
LIAM: I gave up trying to
understand her years ago.

01:06:34.573 --> 01:06:37.165
MARISHA: Do you know what time it is?

01:06:37.165 --> 01:06:39.578
I'm feeling a bit nappy.

01:06:39.578 --> 01:06:41.149
ORION: Your hair looks fine.

01:06:41.149 --> 01:06:43.331
LIAM: Well, I--
SAM: Wait-- (shushes)

01:06:43.331 --> 01:06:46.553
MATT: "If you need rest, then rest.

01:06:46.553 --> 01:06:49.303
"Time of day has no bearing down here."

01:06:51.177 --> 01:06:52.885
MARISHA: I have to rest so I can--

01:06:52.885 --> 01:06:56.055
I'm gonna read up on this Daylight spell,

01:06:56.055 --> 01:06:59.034
so that you and me can both cast it.

01:06:59.034 --> 01:07:01.274
ASHLEY Yeah, we'll just take a nap and just get,

01:07:01.274 --> 01:07:04.981
you know, rest our muscles,
and get ready for the fight.

01:07:06.658 --> 01:07:09.490
TRAVIS: I'm gonna read up
on this Chopping Head spell.

01:07:09.840 --> 01:07:10.899
Yep, I'm read up.

01:07:10.899 --> 01:07:13.495
SAM: I'm gonna sing a little song to inspire

01:07:13.495 --> 01:07:16.488
a couple of my allies here, if I can.

01:07:16.488 --> 01:07:18.452
MATT: Okay, I would recommend
doing it after rest.

01:07:18.452 --> 01:07:20.238
The dice would go away while they rest.

01:07:20.238 --> 01:07:21.180
SAM: Okay, forget it.

01:07:21.180 --> 01:07:24.097
MARISHA: I go ahead and I light an incense

01:07:24.097 --> 01:07:27.925
in our teepee, and I make some flowers grow.

01:07:27.925 --> 01:07:29.092
That's better. That's nice.

01:07:30.207 --> 01:07:32.527
TALIESIN: I'm gonna do a little bit of work

01:07:32.527 --> 01:07:34.549
on that first trick arrow.

01:07:34.549 --> 01:07:35.954
On the trap arrow.

01:07:35.954 --> 01:07:37.548
Since I've got a little time.

01:07:37.548 --> 01:07:39.235
MATT: Go ahead and make a roll.

01:07:39.235 --> 01:07:40.318
TALIESIN: That's a--

01:07:40.871 --> 01:07:42.288
What am I rolling?

01:07:42.288 --> 01:07:44.879
MATT: Your engineering-- your tinker's kit.

01:07:44.879 --> 01:07:47.223
TALIESIN: Oh, it's just an intelligence roll, right?

01:07:47.223 --> 01:07:48.632
MATT: Plus your tinker's kit proficiency.

01:07:48.632 --> 01:07:50.973
It's down underneath your skills.

01:07:50.973 --> 01:07:53.075
Proficiency, at the very bottom left.

01:07:53.075 --> 01:07:55.388
TALIESIN: Yeah, I don't have a number for that.

01:07:55.388 --> 01:07:58.190
MATT: You can add your proficiency modifier
to your intelligence check.

01:07:58.190 --> 01:08:00.957
Add your intelligence modifier plus four.

01:08:00.957 --> 01:08:02.290
TALIESIN: Ah, thank you.

01:08:04.560 --> 01:08:05.266
17.

01:08:05.266 --> 01:08:06.919
MATT: All right, and so what are
you trying to accomplish

01:08:06.919 --> 01:08:07.952
with this arrow again?

01:08:07.952 --> 01:08:10.250
TALIESIN: I was just trying to make
an entanglement arrow.

01:08:10.250 --> 01:08:12.153
It's a trapper's arrow.

01:08:12.153 --> 01:08:13.267
MATT: Okay.

01:08:13.267 --> 01:08:16.497
You manage to work out what
seems like a tanglefoot bag-type

01:08:16.497 --> 01:08:19.011
detonation, where if an arrow were fired,

01:08:19.011 --> 01:08:21.005
it would be a grapple check
against the individual,

01:08:21.005 --> 01:08:22.658
probably give them
penalties until they're able

01:08:22.658 --> 01:08:24.193
to break free of the grapple.

01:08:24.193 --> 01:08:25.587
So yeah, success on that one.

01:08:25.587 --> 01:08:27.291
TRAVIS: Nice job, Doogie.

01:08:27.291 --> 01:08:29.607
TALIESIN: I'm gonna be Hawkeyeing
Laura out at some point,

01:08:29.607 --> 01:08:30.720
I got a couple of them.

01:08:30.720 --> 01:08:32.312
ORION: Before I retire, Clarota,

01:08:32.312 --> 01:08:35.187
you said you wanted to
speak with me later.

01:08:35.187 --> 01:08:36.434
Anything in particular,

01:08:36.434 --> 01:08:39.254
or you wish to save it for after the battle?

01:08:39.254 --> 01:08:40.638
MATT: "Perhaps after.

01:08:40.638 --> 01:08:43.953
"I just am curious about the source

01:08:43.953 --> 01:08:45.899
"of your Arcane power."

01:08:45.899 --> 01:08:47.493
ORION: Ooh, I'd be happy to discuss it.

01:08:47.493 --> 01:08:51.161
I could learn a great
deal from you as well.

01:08:52.978 --> 01:08:53.943
MATT: "Later."

01:08:53.943 --> 01:08:55.765
ORION: Later, of course.

01:08:55.765 --> 01:08:57.750
I go to my books.

01:08:57.750 --> 01:08:59.113
MATT: So Clarota closes his eyes,

01:08:59.113 --> 01:09:01.337
and kind of goes into a meditative stance.

01:09:01.337 --> 01:09:03.693
The rest of you, those
who have spells to choose,

01:09:03.693 --> 01:09:05.940
go ahead and choose
your spells accordingly

01:09:05.940 --> 01:09:07.066
for the next day.

01:09:07.066 --> 01:09:08.066
TRAVIS: Rub it in.

01:09:08.066 --> 01:09:10.381
I'm sharpening my ax.

01:09:10.381 --> 01:09:11.908
MATT: Good. Good.

01:09:11.908 --> 01:09:13.207
TRAVIS: It is good.

01:09:13.207 --> 01:09:15.345
SAM: Just doing my vocal warmups.

01:09:15.345 --> 01:09:18.729
♫ Me me me me me me me me me ♫

01:09:18.729 --> 01:09:19.970
MARISHA: I'm meditating.

01:09:19.970 --> 01:09:23.075
SAM: ♫ Molto bene, molto bene, 
molto bene, molto bene ♫

01:09:23.075 --> 01:09:25.779
TRAVIS: The human torch was denied a bank loan.

01:09:25.779 --> 01:09:28.029
(all laugh)

01:09:30.447 --> 01:09:33.608
MATT: So as you all have your evening's rest...

01:09:33.608 --> 01:09:35.017
Not very comfortable.

01:09:35.017 --> 01:09:37.021
Number one, you're in the middle of a tent

01:09:37.021 --> 01:09:38.923
of a goblinoid city. Second,

01:09:38.923 --> 01:09:42.064
just the general proximity
of sleeping near an illithid,

01:09:42.064 --> 01:09:45.455
you just have a general
sense of unsettling dreams,

01:09:45.455 --> 01:09:47.513
imagery that is disturbing.

01:09:48.493 --> 01:09:52.138
Pike, you have many flashbacks
to the vision you had,

01:09:52.138 --> 01:09:54.145
and actually wake partway through the night

01:09:54.145 --> 01:09:55.251
in a cold sweat.

01:09:55.251 --> 01:09:59.076
As you wake up, you all
kind of slowly come to,

01:09:59.076 --> 01:10:01.230
it's about four hours
into the evening's rest.

01:10:01.230 --> 01:10:02.650
You feel a slight tremor,

01:10:02.650 --> 01:10:05.409
a familiar tremor that
you felt once before in this cavern.

01:10:05.409 --> 01:10:06.719
(rumbling)

01:10:06.719 --> 01:10:09.660
You feel the ground begin
to vibrate and shake.

01:10:09.660 --> 01:10:11.910
TALIESIN: I get up and look around.

01:10:12.995 --> 01:10:14.328
SAM: Is Clay awake?

01:10:15.331 --> 01:10:16.815
(all laugh)

01:10:16.815 --> 01:10:18.580
MATT: Eyes are open, just sitting there.

01:10:18.580 --> 01:10:20.787
SAM: Clarota, do you know
what that rumbling is?

01:10:20.787 --> 01:10:24.379
MATT: "There are many creatures
that live in this rock.

01:10:24.379 --> 01:10:25.879
"You'd best be still."

01:10:26.950 --> 01:10:28.331
SAM: Ooh, still.

01:10:28.331 --> 01:10:29.164
MATT: "Still."

01:10:30.961 --> 01:10:31.957
ORION: Don't move.

01:10:31.957 --> 01:10:33.707
TRAVIS: So, vocal warm ups.

01:10:34.639 --> 01:10:36.402
MATT: Everyone make a stealth check.

01:10:36.402 --> 01:10:37.235
MARISHA: Oh!

01:10:37.235 --> 01:10:38.535
TRAVIS: Fucking nipples.

01:10:38.535 --> 01:10:39.355
MARISHA: Pooper.

01:10:42.940 --> 01:10:44.870
TRAVIS: We get advantage on that, right?

01:10:45.483 --> 01:10:46.259
MATT: Nope!

01:10:46.259 --> 01:10:47.092
ORION: 16.

01:10:48.501 --> 01:10:49.576
SAM: 14.

01:10:49.576 --> 01:10:50.675
MARISHA: 19.
TALIESIN: 18.

01:10:50.675 --> 01:10:51.592
LIAM: 20.

01:10:51.592 --> 01:10:52.729
ASHLEY: One.

01:10:52.729 --> 01:10:53.866
TRAVIS: One.

01:10:53.866 --> 01:10:55.003
(all laugh)

01:10:55.003 --> 01:10:56.232
MATT: Two natural ones?

01:10:56.232 --> 01:10:57.383
TRAVIS: Yup!

01:10:57.383 --> 01:10:59.492
SAM: After her two natural 20's.

01:10:59.492 --> 01:11:00.745
LIAM: Nothing to add.

01:11:00.745 --> 01:11:02.441
ASHLEY: Nothing to add.

01:11:02.441 --> 01:11:04.166
Well I'm new to armor, you know.

01:11:04.166 --> 01:11:05.860
MATT: You both rolled natural ones.

01:11:05.860 --> 01:11:08.006
Those both count as two failures.

01:11:08.006 --> 01:11:08.939
ASHLEY: Fuck.

01:11:08.939 --> 01:11:11.958
MATT: Thankfully, the rest of your group
all rolled pretty high.

01:11:11.958 --> 01:11:13.544
So it was four versus five.

01:11:13.875 --> 01:11:14.708
ORION: Yes!

01:11:14.708 --> 01:11:15.935
MATT: You guys just barely succeed.

01:11:15.935 --> 01:11:19.105
As you all hold still, barely breathe,

01:11:19.115 --> 01:11:20.657
the rumbling intensifies,

01:11:20.657 --> 01:11:23.157
and goes on for a good
minute, minute and a half,

01:11:23.157 --> 01:11:25.048
before it eventually subsides.

01:11:25.048 --> 01:11:25.968
TRAVIS: Aw.

01:11:25.968 --> 01:11:27.963
Thought we were gonna get a warm up.

01:11:27.963 --> 01:11:29.864
MATT: Fades into the distance.

01:11:29.864 --> 01:11:32.074
Rumbling is complete.

01:11:32.074 --> 01:11:34.044
It appears to be no issue.

01:11:34.044 --> 01:11:35.127
Clarota says,

01:11:36.305 --> 01:11:39.936
"Many of these creatures,
they pick up on movement,

01:11:39.936 --> 01:11:42.103
"in that sound, be wary."

01:11:43.151 --> 01:11:44.894
LIAM: What creatures are you speaking of now?

01:11:44.894 --> 01:11:45.727
Is this something--

01:11:45.727 --> 01:11:47.354
SAM: The rumbling creatures.

01:11:47.354 --> 01:11:49.076
LIAM: But what are they?

01:11:49.076 --> 01:11:51.166
ORION: Probably buttholes.

01:11:51.166 --> 01:11:52.893
MATT: "I've only got glimpses."

01:11:52.893 --> 01:11:56.237
LIAM: This is something worse
than umberhulks, I assume.

01:11:56.237 --> 01:11:57.404
MATT: "Larger, yes."

01:11:59.734 --> 01:12:00.854
SAM: All right, we've all rested up.

01:12:00.854 --> 01:12:03.448
LIAM: Buttholes in the underdark!

01:12:03.448 --> 01:12:05.838
SAM: I had a crazy dream.

01:12:05.838 --> 01:12:08.333
It said if Geek &amp;amp; Sundry got to 1,400 followers,

01:12:08.333 --> 01:12:10.659
there would be some sort of a giveaway.

01:12:10.659 --> 01:12:13.260
ORION: Oh, I had the same dream, Scanlan!

01:12:13.260 --> 01:12:14.084
SAM: Wow!

01:12:14.084 --> 01:12:15.984
MATT: Yeah guys, just so you're aware,

01:12:15.984 --> 01:12:17.426
every 50 subscribers we get,

01:12:17.426 --> 01:12:20.952
we are giving away an awesome
Geek &amp;amp; Sundry game package.

01:12:20.952 --> 01:12:23.036
ZAC: Ethanmyhead just won one.

01:12:23.036 --> 01:12:24.954
MATT: Oh, there you go, congratulations!

01:12:24.954 --> 01:12:26.197
We already got a winner.

01:12:26.197 --> 01:12:28.955
We'll be putting those out for every 50
subscribers we get tonight.

01:12:28.955 --> 01:12:31.570
We'll be choosing one to
win that awesome award,

01:12:31.570 --> 01:12:34.277
our wonderful package,
so keep that in mind.

01:12:37.807 --> 01:12:40.491
SAM: So the plan is again, you and I,

01:12:40.491 --> 01:12:43.309
stealth. The rest, attack with light?

01:12:43.309 --> 01:12:45.751
What's first, what's second,
what happens here?

01:12:45.751 --> 01:12:48.077
LIAM: Well, I need to take a moment to find some--

01:12:48.077 --> 01:12:51.115
I'm gonna look around and
see if I can find any pitch,

01:12:51.115 --> 01:12:52.760
anywhere in the goblin camp.

01:12:52.760 --> 01:12:55.460
MATT: Okay, go ahead and make a survival check.

01:12:55.460 --> 01:12:57.358
Actually, this would be investigation.

01:12:57.358 --> 01:12:59.036
LIAM: Investigation.

01:12:59.036 --> 01:13:01.703
I got the exact same number, 12.

01:13:02.919 --> 01:13:04.625
MATT: Takes about an hour.

01:13:04.625 --> 01:13:07.495
You manage to find, essentially, a few piles of

01:13:08.480 --> 01:13:12.237
rather disgusting,
sticky, goblinoid refuse,

01:13:12.237 --> 01:13:15.278
that you imagine will probably
stick and burn pretty well.

01:13:15.278 --> 01:13:16.788
In a pitch-type way, yeah.

01:13:16.788 --> 01:13:17.838
LIAM: Goblin shit?

01:13:17.838 --> 01:13:20.308
MATT: You find just a whole
bunch of goblin shit.

01:13:20.308 --> 01:13:22.742
LIAM: Let's cook it up a little.

01:13:22.742 --> 01:13:25.194
TALIESIN: How do you feel about
lacing it with gun powder?

01:13:25.194 --> 01:13:26.787
SAM: I'll make some fire for you.

01:13:26.787 --> 01:13:28.573
LIAM: Feel pretty good about that.

01:13:28.573 --> 01:13:31.421
MARISHA: Goblin molotov cocktails? I like that.

01:13:31.421 --> 01:13:32.963
TALIESIN: Goblin poop cocktail.

01:13:32.963 --> 01:13:35.298
LIAM: So here's how I think this goes.

01:13:35.298 --> 01:13:37.655
I think the team

01:13:37.655 --> 01:13:40.333
infuses the carpet, and any shields,

01:13:40.333 --> 01:13:42.757
or head pots they have with radiant light.

01:13:43.867 --> 01:13:46.553
They go in and make a big
stink on the side of the camp.

01:13:46.553 --> 01:13:48.330
You and I go in, you're invisible.

01:13:48.330 --> 01:13:49.855
I'm a--

01:13:49.855 --> 01:13:53.585
SAM: Fly, flea, mosquito,
dragonfly, whatever you'd like.

01:13:53.585 --> 01:13:55.335
LIAM: Yes, let's say fly.

01:13:56.600 --> 01:13:59.933
We go in, find the illithid, and then

01:14:02.682 --> 01:14:03.682
we pop in,

01:14:05.435 --> 01:14:07.540
you yell, "Hey, Spanky,"

01:14:07.540 --> 01:14:09.264
throw goblin shit in its face.

01:14:09.264 --> 01:14:12.207
SAM: Or I try to blind it with magic.

01:14:12.207 --> 01:14:13.322
LIAM: Yes.

01:14:13.322 --> 01:14:14.155
TALIESIN: Both.

01:14:14.155 --> 01:14:15.905
ORION: Both! Why not both?

01:14:17.603 --> 01:14:20.611
LIAM: We want to increase our odds.

01:14:20.611 --> 01:14:24.278
As soon as he's blind,
I go in for the kill.

01:14:25.442 --> 01:14:28.710
And then it's on us to deal
with what happens after that.

01:14:28.710 --> 01:14:30.053
TRAVIS: It's playtime.

01:14:30.053 --> 01:14:31.313
LIAM: It's playtime.

01:14:31.313 --> 01:14:33.897
SAM: Might I suggest one other wrinkle.

01:14:33.897 --> 01:14:34.980
LIAM: Yes, please do.

01:14:34.980 --> 01:14:37.856
SAM: Remember there are some
dwarves being held captive.

01:14:37.856 --> 01:14:40.052
We can make our way to
them and release them.

01:14:40.052 --> 01:14:42.063
TRAVIS: We don't need all of them, though.

01:14:42.063 --> 01:14:43.724
Just to cause further distraction,

01:14:43.724 --> 01:14:45.799
or to get some allies on the inside.

01:14:45.799 --> 01:14:48.597
LIAM: It's possible they could
be weary, frightened.

01:14:48.597 --> 01:14:49.430
TALIESIN: Mind controlled.

01:14:49.430 --> 01:14:51.776
LIAM: Seems unreliable-- yes, mind controlled.

01:14:51.776 --> 01:14:53.929
TRAVIS: They're probably ready to fight, like me.

01:14:53.929 --> 01:14:55.361
(all laugh)

01:14:55.361 --> 01:14:58.786
SAM: Grog, we understand, you
want to bash some things.

01:14:58.786 --> 01:15:00.657
LIAM: Your time to kill is coming.

01:15:00.657 --> 01:15:03.232
SAM: All right, is there anyone else in the party

01:15:03.232 --> 01:15:06.223
who could help us with stealth, or anything?

01:15:06.223 --> 01:15:07.618
ASHLEY: Definitely not me.

01:15:07.618 --> 01:15:08.451
SAM: Okay.

01:15:08.451 --> 01:15:09.504
TRAVIS: Clang clang.

01:15:09.504 --> 01:15:11.432
ASHLEY Clang clang clang clang.

01:15:11.432 --> 01:15:14.449
MATT: As a note, just remember. 
Because you're the one who walked through.

01:15:14.449 --> 01:15:17.336
There is essentially a shanty town, 
a tent city of war tents.

01:15:17.336 --> 01:15:18.646
With a few rock formations.

01:15:19.562 --> 01:15:21.881
You also notice that, or
you remember last time,

01:15:21.881 --> 01:15:24.742
that there was the main square
that had the raised platform.

01:15:24.742 --> 01:15:27.039
And then there was the
small stone barracks,

01:15:27.039 --> 01:15:29.019
where it seemed both the mind flayer

01:15:29.019 --> 01:15:31.930
and the duergar general both went back in.

01:15:31.930 --> 01:15:33.765
SAM: So we gotta go into the barracks.

01:15:33.765 --> 01:15:36.087
MATT: Well that's where you
saw at least they were

01:15:36.087 --> 01:15:37.240
last time you were there.

01:15:37.240 --> 01:15:39.016
LIAM: That's our starting point, I imagine.

01:15:39.016 --> 01:15:40.412
ORION: Well, there's two targets.

01:15:40.412 --> 01:15:41.892
SAM: So we gotta get in, and then get in.

01:15:41.892 --> 01:15:43.618
LIAM: The main thing is to get the illithid,

01:15:43.618 --> 01:15:47.015
because if he's out, nobody's--

01:15:47.015 --> 01:15:49.859
Then they're all separate.

01:15:49.859 --> 01:15:52.303
He's playing chess with all his minions

01:15:52.303 --> 01:15:53.303
until we take him out.

01:15:53.303 --> 01:15:54.670
TRAVIS: I hate chess.

01:15:54.670 --> 01:15:56.886
ORION: So we all strike right on him.

01:15:56.886 --> 01:16:00.192
You two are going to
take that little journey.

01:16:00.192 --> 01:16:02.501
The rest of us, what shall we do?

01:16:02.501 --> 01:16:05.627
I have many options and they're all fun.

01:16:05.627 --> 01:16:06.460
So Percy.

01:16:07.884 --> 01:16:09.116
Your sniper rifle.

01:16:09.116 --> 01:16:11.147
I should think that you want to post up

01:16:11.147 --> 01:16:12.809
and start taking out position.

01:16:12.809 --> 01:16:15.052
TALIESIN: I'll do that at first, 
but then eventually

01:16:15.052 --> 01:16:17.261
I'm going to just have to
jump into the fray.

01:16:17.261 --> 01:16:20.704
ORION: Yes, of course, onslaught
to the rest of the camp,

01:16:20.704 --> 01:16:22.386
that we'll go about it too, right?

01:16:22.386 --> 01:16:24.358
Make a bunch of noise, a bunch of light.

01:16:24.358 --> 01:16:27.906
SAM: How are you going to get Grog over there?

01:16:27.906 --> 01:16:32.026
MARISHA: I'm gonna put a giant
sunlight beacon on his head,

01:16:32.026 --> 01:16:34.151
and I'm gonna release him to the wilds.

01:16:34.151 --> 01:16:36.348
LIAM: Yes, but there's no
bridge, we talked about--

01:16:36.348 --> 01:16:38.294
MARISHA: Oh, how are we gonna
get him over it?

01:16:38.294 --> 01:16:40.517
LIAM: We have an infinite amount of rope.

01:16:40.517 --> 01:16:42.352
SAM: How do we get it over there?

01:16:42.352 --> 01:16:44.875
LIAM: Tiberius talks about making
him light as a feather.

01:16:44.875 --> 01:16:46.340
TRAVIS: Or you can fly me.

01:16:46.340 --> 01:16:48.028
SAM: Yes, you can fly him, right?

01:16:48.028 --> 01:16:49.350
ORION: Perhaps you can fly.

01:16:49.350 --> 01:16:51.902
TRAVIS: Why don't we turn my
pot into a lighthouse,

01:16:51.902 --> 01:16:54.097
and then you fly me
over, and I'll do like,

01:16:54.097 --> 01:16:56.097
abominable snow man walk.

01:16:56.097 --> 01:16:57.773
MARISHA: I like that.

01:16:57.773 --> 01:16:59.931
LIAM: Clarota, is there anything you can do

01:16:59.931 --> 01:17:02.141
to help us on this endeavor?

01:17:02.997 --> 01:17:08.330
MATT: "I can try to cloud his mind 
with mine,

01:17:08.330 --> 01:17:13.558
"but you have to swear
to protect me from harm."

01:17:13.947 --> 01:17:15.609
LIAM: You have our word.

01:17:15.609 --> 01:17:17.670
SAM: -- that we will try.

01:17:17.670 --> 01:17:19.132
(all laugh)

01:17:20.012 --> 01:17:21.309
MATT: "Then I will come.

01:17:22.257 --> 01:17:23.974
"You must work swiftly.

01:17:23.974 --> 01:17:28.897
"If we can leap most of the city,

01:17:28.897 --> 01:17:31.139
"get to that barrack, storm it,

01:17:31.139 --> 01:17:34.972
"and take out the mind flayer that resides."

01:17:37.506 --> 01:17:40.852
SAM: Let's set down right in
the middle of the thing.

01:17:40.852 --> 01:17:43.333
MARISHA: Well I was gonna say,
can we set down where

01:17:43.333 --> 01:17:45.172
we're kind of backing you guys up,

01:17:45.172 --> 01:17:47.334
holding the fort down while you guys go?

01:17:47.334 --> 01:17:48.860
LIAM: There's no bridge.

01:17:48.860 --> 01:17:50.340
SAM: We all have to get there.

01:17:50.345 --> 01:17:51.458
MARISHA: I'm not worried about that.

01:17:51.458 --> 01:17:52.919
LIAM: Get over together, get to the edge.

01:17:52.919 --> 01:17:54.731
SAM: Yes, but where are we going to make land?

01:17:54.731 --> 01:17:57.003
In the middle of the shit,
next to the barracks?

01:17:57.003 --> 01:17:59.275
MARISHA: I say we might as well
go closest to the barracks as we can get.

01:17:59.275 --> 01:18:02.142
SAM: Okay, then you and I
can get in the barracks.

01:18:02.142 --> 01:18:05.355
LIAM: That's a good idea.
If we go as high as we can,

01:18:05.358 --> 01:18:07.939
and just hug the ceiling
of this motherfucker,

01:18:07.939 --> 01:18:09.441
and then go down in the middle.

01:18:09.441 --> 01:18:11.782
And as we're going down,

01:18:11.782 --> 01:18:14.129
you turn me into a fly and go invisible,

01:18:14.129 --> 01:18:16.234
and that's when all hell breaks lose.

01:18:16.234 --> 01:18:17.817
TRAVIS: I like that part.

01:18:18.657 --> 01:18:19.470
Let's do it.

01:18:19.470 --> 01:18:20.990
LIAM: No time like the present.

01:18:20.990 --> 01:18:22.452
TRAVIS: Hands up if you're in.

01:18:22.452 --> 01:18:25.079
MARISHA: I'm gonna start buffing people like crazy.

01:18:25.079 --> 01:18:26.701
ORION: I cast Stoneskin.

01:18:26.701 --> 01:18:28.877
TALIESIN: Gonna be buffing us
like a vampire slayer.

01:18:28.877 --> 01:18:31.142
MARISHA: Oh! Joss Whedon
up in this bitch!

01:18:31.142 --> 01:18:33.286
SAM: Question to the dungeon master.

01:18:33.286 --> 01:18:34.096
MATT: Yes.

01:18:34.096 --> 01:18:36.527
SAM: I think my Polymorph spell
is a concentration spell.

01:18:36.527 --> 01:18:37.360
MATT: It is, yes.

01:18:39.440 --> 01:18:40.857
SAM: I'm going solo.

01:18:42.879 --> 01:18:44.138
(sighs)

01:18:44.138 --> 01:18:44.971
TRAVIS: Do it.

01:18:44.971 --> 01:18:46.370
SAM: I can get you in.

01:18:46.370 --> 01:18:47.645
I can make you a fly,

01:18:47.645 --> 01:18:49.681
but I can't be invisible at the same time.

01:18:49.681 --> 01:18:51.598
LIAM: I will sneak through.

01:18:52.999 --> 01:18:57.239
If shit goes south, I will
peel off and join the others.

01:18:57.239 --> 01:19:00.250
MARISHA: Well, I can cast Pass
Without A Trace on myself,

01:19:00.250 --> 01:19:02.542
and as long as we hug close to me,

01:19:02.542 --> 01:19:05.155
there's an area around me
that's like a dark shadow.

01:19:05.155 --> 01:19:07.322
We get like, all stealthy.

01:19:09.430 --> 01:19:10.470
SAM: We're going in.

01:19:10.470 --> 01:19:12.042
LIAM: We're just gonna have to improvise that.

01:19:12.042 --> 01:19:13.474
We'll do it live, we'll do it live.

01:19:13.474 --> 01:19:15.174
MARISHA: Wait, wait, wait! Don't go in yet.

01:19:15.174 --> 01:19:16.492
Let me buff people.

01:19:16.492 --> 01:19:17.811
MATT: You said you were casting Stoneskin?

01:19:17.811 --> 01:19:18.926
Stoneskin is concentration.

01:19:18.926 --> 01:19:20.121
The moment you cast another
concentration spell,

01:19:20.121 --> 01:19:21.204
it goes away.

01:19:22.584 --> 01:19:23.675
ORION: Oh, right.

01:19:23.675 --> 01:19:24.954
So I don't cast it, then.

01:19:24.954 --> 01:19:27.204
(all laugh)

01:19:29.093 --> 01:19:31.158
God damned concentration spells.

01:19:31.158 --> 01:19:33.127
TRAVIS: I would like to cast, um.

01:19:33.127 --> 01:19:35.377
(all laugh)

01:19:36.345 --> 01:19:38.095
TRAVIS: Blood Lust on myself.

01:19:39.486 --> 01:19:40.516
Blood Lust.

01:19:40.516 --> 01:19:44.266
MARISHA: I go ahead and I cast
Enhance Ability on Vex.

01:19:46.580 --> 01:19:48.330
ALL: Vax.

01:19:48.330 --> 01:19:49.552
LIAM: Sorry, everybody does it.

01:19:49.552 --> 01:19:51.536
Our mother did it, I do it sometimes.

01:19:51.536 --> 01:19:52.621
MATT: To increase his dexterity?

01:19:52.621 --> 01:19:54.040
MARISHA: To increase your dexterity.

01:19:54.040 --> 01:19:56.297
MATT: So essentially you have advantage

01:19:56.297 --> 01:19:58.448
on dexterity-based checks, yeah.

01:19:58.448 --> 01:19:59.783
MARISHA: Which is your stealth, right?

01:19:59.783 --> 01:20:01.224
MATT: Yes.

01:20:01.224 --> 01:20:02.877
MARISHA: And then I'm gonna go ahead

01:20:02.877 --> 01:20:04.434
and let me keep track of all this.

01:20:04.434 --> 01:20:07.860
And I'm gonna go ahead and cast Daylight

01:20:07.860 --> 01:20:09.853
on Grog's helmet.

01:20:11.460 --> 01:20:12.896
Are we ready for this, are we going?

01:20:12.896 --> 01:20:13.729
SAM: Yeah, let's go.

01:20:13.729 --> 01:20:14.562
TRAVIS: Let's do it.

01:20:14.562 --> 01:20:18.418
MARISHA: And I'm gonna go ahead
and cast Daylight on--

01:20:18.418 --> 01:20:19.472
SAM: Wait.

01:20:19.472 --> 01:20:20.305
TRAVIS: What?

01:20:20.305 --> 01:20:21.191
SAM: Wait.

01:20:21.191 --> 01:20:24.626
We're trying to sneak
over them before we land.

01:20:24.626 --> 01:20:26.310
Don't cast Daylight on anything yet.

01:20:26.310 --> 01:20:28.752
We don't wanna be bright
and shiny in the sky.

01:20:28.752 --> 01:20:30.807
MATT: A giant flare coasting over the city.

01:20:30.807 --> 01:20:31.906
TRAVIS: We'll be like UFO's.

01:20:31.906 --> 01:20:33.320
LIAM: (hissing)

01:20:33.320 --> 01:20:34.970
MARISHA: I'm gonna go ahead and
cast Pass Without A Trace

01:20:34.970 --> 01:20:35.803
on myself.

01:20:37.346 --> 01:20:39.659
MATT: All right, so that's preparation there.

01:20:39.659 --> 01:20:43.151
SAM: I'm gonna sing a little
ditty to inspire Vax.

01:20:43.151 --> 01:20:45.785
♫ I didn't see the Vax

01:20:45.785 --> 01:20:48.972
♫ 'Cause he's so goddamned stealthy

01:20:48.972 --> 01:20:52.829
♫ Da da da da da da da da

01:20:52.829 --> 01:20:54.240
TRAVIS: Was that "I Saw The Sun"?

01:20:54.240 --> 01:20:55.073
SAM: Yes it was.

01:20:55.073 --> 01:20:57.018
(all laugh)

01:20:57.018 --> 01:20:58.464
MATT: That wondrous rendition allows you

01:20:58.464 --> 01:21:01.714
a d8 inspiration dice, hold on to that.

01:21:04.933 --> 01:21:06.213
ORION: Is everybody finished?

01:21:06.213 --> 01:21:09.167
LIAM: Vox Machina, let's do this shit.

01:21:09.167 --> 01:21:12.219
MARISHA: I turn into an eagle,
and I'll take the gnomes.

01:21:12.219 --> 01:21:13.731
MATT: All right.

01:21:13.731 --> 01:21:14.564
Scanlan.

01:21:15.699 --> 01:21:16.830
Pike is heavy with the plate mail,

01:21:16.830 --> 01:21:21.028
but it's still enough to carry
with your giant eagle form.

01:21:21.028 --> 01:21:23.243
LIAM: Tiberius, Percy, and I are on the carpet,

01:21:23.243 --> 01:21:27.410
and Tiberius, are you good
to help Grog fly across?

01:21:28.393 --> 01:21:29.226
ORION: Fly.

01:21:30.523 --> 01:21:34.518
MATT: At which point you feel this
strange lifting sensation,

01:21:34.518 --> 01:21:36.680
for a second your stomach
kind of has butterflies,

01:21:36.680 --> 01:21:39.720
and you realize that you
can just think forward,

01:21:39.720 --> 01:21:41.024
and you drift forward.

01:21:41.024 --> 01:21:42.821
Think back, you drift back.

01:21:42.821 --> 01:21:44.738
Think up, you drift up.

01:21:45.598 --> 01:21:47.322
TRAVIS: Amazing, don't puke in the helmet though,

01:21:47.322 --> 01:21:49.773
that would be gross.

01:21:49.773 --> 01:21:52.734
(imitates puking)

01:21:52.734 --> 01:21:55.630
ORION: Am I light enough for him to take me in?

01:21:55.630 --> 01:21:57.112
TRAVIS: I can't see anything.

01:21:57.112 --> 01:21:58.840
Just a cauldron on my head.

01:21:58.840 --> 01:21:59.696
ORION: For him to carry me.

01:21:59.696 --> 01:22:00.529
MATT: For him to carry you?

01:22:00.529 --> 01:22:01.389
Yeah, yeah.

01:22:01.389 --> 01:22:03.317
ORION: I hop on your back.

01:22:03.317 --> 01:22:04.635
Let's go, Grog.

01:22:04.635 --> 01:22:05.468
TRAVIS: Great.

01:22:07.090 --> 01:22:09.630
MARISHA: I guess the rest of them are on the rug?

01:22:09.630 --> 01:22:11.560
TRAVIS: I can't see, so you gotta tell me.

01:22:11.560 --> 01:22:13.250
I start flying the wrong way.

01:22:13.250 --> 01:22:16.329
ORION: Back up, the other way,
other way, very good.

01:22:16.329 --> 01:22:18.333
MATT: You actually clutch Grog
by the sides of his face,

01:22:18.333 --> 01:22:19.544
and start steering him.

01:22:19.544 --> 01:22:21.189
(all laugh)

01:22:21.189 --> 01:22:22.146
ORION: Wherever I move your head,

01:22:22.146 --> 01:22:23.729
just tilt that way.

01:22:26.212 --> 01:22:29.008
SAM: Are we all in flight now?

01:22:29.008 --> 01:22:30.079
LIAM: We're all taken care of, yes.

01:22:30.079 --> 01:22:32.298
SAM: And the carpet?

01:22:32.298 --> 01:22:34.973
LIAM: Tiberius, Percy, and I are on the carpet.

01:22:34.973 --> 01:22:36.390
SAM: What about Vex?

01:22:37.333 --> 01:22:38.166
Is she with us?

01:22:38.166 --> 01:22:39.022
ASHLEY: She's on the carpet.

01:22:39.022 --> 01:22:40.059
SAM: She's staying behind.

01:22:40.059 --> 01:22:42.411
MATT: Vex, for the time being,

01:22:42.411 --> 01:22:44.888
because it's just easier
to organize for that,

01:22:44.888 --> 01:22:46.570
is coming on the carpet with you guys,

01:22:46.570 --> 01:22:49.820
and is preparing in case she is needed.

01:22:50.698 --> 01:22:52.525
TALIESIN: She's just quiet 
'cause she's feeling smug

01:22:52.525 --> 01:22:53.882
about the last game.

01:22:53.882 --> 01:22:54.715
LIAM: Yes.

01:22:55.609 --> 01:23:00.078
MATT: She's feeling smug about
making another RPG right now.

01:23:00.078 --> 01:23:00.911
LIAM: She'll be back.

01:23:00.911 --> 01:23:03.257
SAM: I wanna see how you fly, Grog.

01:23:03.257 --> 01:23:05.392
ORION: It's really rickety!

01:23:05.392 --> 01:23:07.600
TRAVIS: It's one arm in and one forward.

01:23:07.600 --> 01:23:09.030
(all laugh)

01:23:09.030 --> 01:23:10.113
ORION: Just think.

01:23:12.242 --> 01:23:14.776
LIAM: Do you propel yourself with thoughts?

01:23:14.776 --> 01:23:16.963
MATT: It's an awkward zig zag.

01:23:16.963 --> 01:23:20.046
TALIESIN: Do you think happy thoughts?

01:23:22.057 --> 01:23:23.590
MARISHA: I'm gonna fly in the middle

01:23:23.590 --> 01:23:26.709
between Grog and the carpet,

01:23:26.709 --> 01:23:30.876
that way my Pass Without A
Trace encompasses everybody.

01:23:31.905 --> 01:23:32.870
MATT: All right.

01:23:32.870 --> 01:23:35.604
LIAM: I turn to Scanlan and say, Scanlan,

01:23:35.604 --> 01:23:38.055
we are probably going to die today.

01:23:38.055 --> 01:23:39.759
It has been an honor.

01:23:39.759 --> 01:23:41.489
SAM: It has been an honor.

01:23:41.489 --> 01:23:42.534
ASHLEY: You won't die today.

01:23:42.534 --> 01:23:44.076
SAM: Only one of us will die.

01:23:44.076 --> 01:23:45.659
And it won't be me.

01:23:46.729 --> 01:23:48.581
I can be invisible.

01:23:48.581 --> 01:23:49.414
(all laugh)

01:23:49.414 --> 01:23:51.416
ORION: You're not listening, it'll just happen.

01:23:51.416 --> 01:23:52.266
LIAM: What were you saying Tiberius?

01:23:52.266 --> 01:23:53.470
ORION: Nothing.

01:23:53.470 --> 01:23:57.546
LIAM: Don't play it that way,
what were you saying?

01:23:57.546 --> 01:23:59.476
ORION: I was saying, if you're all finished,

01:23:59.476 --> 01:24:03.277
I'll just make you invisible
right before it happens.

01:24:03.277 --> 01:24:05.681
MATT: You guys are all coasting over the chasm.

01:24:05.681 --> 01:24:08.481
Now you're over the top
of the large bridge,

01:24:08.481 --> 01:24:12.314
and the 200-foot-wide
open hole in this tunnel

01:24:13.854 --> 01:24:15.741
that leads to the lake below.

01:24:15.741 --> 01:24:18.364
As you glance down, you
can see just a little bit

01:24:18.364 --> 01:24:19.670
of a trickle from the soft red light

01:24:19.670 --> 01:24:20.922
that is deeper inside.

01:24:20.922 --> 01:24:22.219
You can see the small streams of lava,

01:24:22.219 --> 01:24:24.132
they're just slowly pooling at the bottom

01:24:24.132 --> 01:24:27.082
on the outskirts of the lake proper.

01:24:27.082 --> 01:24:29.697
As you begin to make it to the other side,

01:24:29.697 --> 01:24:31.626
you can see tiny shapes moving in this

01:24:31.626 --> 01:24:34.543
barely lit war camp of the duergar.

01:24:36.763 --> 01:24:37.875
As you're coasting over,

01:24:37.875 --> 01:24:42.735
and Clarota is along with
you guys with his hood up,

01:24:42.735 --> 01:24:45.735
he kind of whispers into
all of your heads, just,

01:24:45.735 --> 01:24:48.485
"Beware that some of these armies

01:24:49.831 --> 01:24:53.914
"carry abominations created
below within my city.

01:24:56.734 --> 01:25:00.045
"I know not what to expect from them.

01:25:00.045 --> 01:25:01.212
"So be wary."

01:25:03.509 --> 01:25:07.050
As this happens, everyone
make a stealth check.

01:25:07.050 --> 01:25:09.397
Everyone, because of the
Pass Without A Track,

01:25:09.397 --> 01:25:11.204
everyone gets a plus ten
to their stealth check.

01:25:11.204 --> 01:25:12.037
TRAVIS: Plus ten?

01:25:12.037 --> 01:25:13.311
MATT: Plus ten.

01:25:13.311 --> 01:25:14.592
Thanks to Keyleth.
SAM: Thank God.

01:25:14.592 --> 01:25:16.283
MATT: Keyleth, however, you
are carrying two gnomes,

01:25:16.283 --> 01:25:17.862
so you have a disadvantage on it.

01:25:17.862 --> 01:25:19.060
ASHLEY: Oh no.

01:25:19.060 --> 01:25:20.310
LIAM: It's all right.

01:25:22.048 --> 01:25:24.048
MARISHA: Even with the plus 10?

01:25:29.819 --> 01:25:30.652
18?

01:25:30.652 --> 01:25:31.485
MATT: 18.

01:25:31.485 --> 01:25:32.318
SAM: 15.

01:25:34.334 --> 01:25:35.994
TALIESIN: 22.

01:25:35.994 --> 01:25:37.170
TRAVIS: 27.

01:25:37.170 --> 01:25:38.065
SAM: Wow.

01:25:38.065 --> 01:25:38.898
ASHLEY: 23.
LIAM: 28.

01:25:44.809 --> 01:25:45.642
MATT: All right.

01:25:45.642 --> 01:25:48.926
You guys begin to crest over
the very top of the war camp,

01:25:48.926 --> 01:25:50.234
and looking down you can see now,

01:25:50.234 --> 01:25:52.417
there are what looks to be the beginnings

01:25:52.417 --> 01:25:55.277
of tunneling siege
engines being constructed.

01:25:55.277 --> 01:25:56.496
SAM: What? Siege?

01:25:56.496 --> 01:25:57.391
MATT: Siege.

01:25:57.391 --> 01:26:00.552
You can see giant wheeled
carts with drills up front,

01:26:00.552 --> 01:26:04.362
giant auger bores that are
being currently constructed.

01:26:04.362 --> 01:26:06.369
You can see what looks
like a series of weapons

01:26:06.369 --> 01:26:07.539
being stacked at the ready.

01:26:07.539 --> 01:26:09.232
You can see there is a preparation

01:26:09.232 --> 01:26:12.821
for some sort of attack
on the city above.

01:26:12.821 --> 01:26:14.090
LIAM: Want to take Kraghammer.

01:26:14.090 --> 01:26:15.670
MATT: Continue to press ahead.

01:26:15.670 --> 01:26:20.261
There does not seem to be
any reaction to your flying.

01:26:20.261 --> 01:26:21.426
SAM: Don't say anything.

01:26:21.426 --> 01:26:23.310
LIAM: This close to the ceiling.

01:26:23.310 --> 01:26:25.364
ASHLEY: Good thing we didn't cast the light.

01:26:25.364 --> 01:26:28.233
ORION: We can all talk to each other.

01:26:28.233 --> 01:26:30.423
SAM: Whisper to each other.

01:26:30.423 --> 01:26:31.256
Shut up!

01:26:32.218 --> 01:26:33.051
MARISHA: Oh, cool.

01:26:33.051 --> 01:26:35.361
SAM: Just wait 'til we get there.

01:26:35.361 --> 01:26:39.600
MATT: You guys make it towards the
center portion of the city.

01:26:39.600 --> 01:26:41.456
TRAVIS: Roll shake it, roll
shake it, roll shake it.

01:26:41.456 --> 01:26:42.456
TALIESIN: Die rolls.

01:26:44.437 --> 01:26:46.046
MATT: You can just start beginning to see

01:26:46.046 --> 01:26:48.461
the opening in the
center of this war camp.

01:26:48.461 --> 01:26:51.285
There is a circle where there
are no tents constructed,

01:26:51.285 --> 01:26:53.784
you can see what looks to
be a small wooden platform,

01:26:53.784 --> 01:26:57.367
and there is a stone
building that is of

01:26:58.523 --> 01:27:01.296
makeshift functional construction.

01:27:01.296 --> 01:27:03.080
Not pretty, but functional,
looks like a barracks,

01:27:03.080 --> 01:27:05.096
or some sort of a large bunker.

01:27:05.096 --> 01:27:08.629
Right on the northern
side of that opening,

01:27:08.629 --> 01:27:10.903
that center portion of the war camp.

01:27:10.903 --> 01:27:12.631
That would be what you saw,

01:27:12.631 --> 01:27:15.543
both the general and the mind
flayer head of this encampment

01:27:15.543 --> 01:27:17.009
go into last time you--

01:27:17.009 --> 01:27:17.842
SAM: The barracks.

01:27:17.842 --> 01:27:18.675
MATT: Yes.

01:27:18.675 --> 01:27:19.508
SAM: With a roof?

01:27:19.508 --> 01:27:20.456
MATT: There is a roof to it,

01:27:20.456 --> 01:27:22.097
you don't know if there's any roof access.

01:27:22.097 --> 01:27:23.764
But there is a roof.

01:27:25.216 --> 01:27:27.472
LIAM: Tiberius, can you turn me invisible now.

01:27:27.472 --> 01:27:29.699
ORION: (sputtering)

01:27:29.699 --> 01:27:32.699
SAM: But we're still in the air, right?

01:27:32.699 --> 01:27:34.838
He's gotta concentrate on that.

01:27:34.838 --> 01:27:36.546
LIAM: He's sitting on the carpet.

01:27:36.546 --> 01:27:37.379
SAM: Yeah but he's--

01:27:37.379 --> 01:27:38.707
MARISHA: Thinking about--

01:27:38.707 --> 01:27:40.104
SAM: Him flying.

01:27:40.104 --> 01:27:41.661
ORION: I cast invisibility on you,

01:27:41.661 --> 01:27:43.156
that's when everything happens.

01:27:43.156 --> 01:27:45.406
(all laugh)

01:27:46.596 --> 01:27:48.201
MARISHA: Just falls from the air.

01:27:48.201 --> 01:27:50.245
LIAM: So are we floating above?

01:27:50.245 --> 01:27:51.903
MATT: You guys are currently

01:27:51.903 --> 01:27:55.298
floating about 100 to 150
feet above the war camp,

01:27:55.298 --> 01:27:57.475
you do not appear to
have been noticed yet.

01:27:57.475 --> 01:27:58.308
TRAVIS: Get down there and wing it.

01:27:58.308 --> 01:27:59.553
SAM: Should we land on the roof?

01:27:59.553 --> 01:28:01.776
Or do we land right
outside the barracks door?

01:28:01.776 --> 01:28:02.609
What do we do?

01:28:02.609 --> 01:28:04.277
ASHLEY: Roof, roof, roof.

01:28:04.277 --> 01:28:06.246
SAM: You guys wanna stay up and we'll go down?

01:28:06.246 --> 01:28:07.242
TRAVIS: You go!

01:28:07.242 --> 01:28:08.075
Yes.

01:28:08.075 --> 01:28:08.908
SAM: Yeah?
TRAVIS: Yes!

01:28:08.908 --> 01:28:09.805
MARISHA: We can start on the roof,

01:28:09.805 --> 01:28:10.857
that way that gives us time.

01:28:10.857 --> 01:28:13.215
LIAM: But I can't go invisible
while you're flying.

01:28:13.215 --> 01:28:14.083
TRAVIS: Who needs you to be invisible?

01:28:14.083 --> 01:28:15.342
You're a stealthy bastard.

01:28:15.342 --> 01:28:16.979
ORION: We land on the roof, we get in there,

01:28:16.979 --> 01:28:18.118
I cast Invisibility on you,

01:28:18.118 --> 01:28:19.077
and then you go do your thing.

01:28:19.077 --> 01:28:22.064
LIAM: We're running the risk of
as we come down on Duergar,

01:28:22.064 --> 01:28:23.760
going (groans).

01:28:23.760 --> 01:28:27.612
ORION: We would risk that anyway, either way.

01:28:27.612 --> 01:28:29.380
SAM: I'm so scared right now.

01:28:29.380 --> 01:28:30.597
(all laugh)

01:28:30.597 --> 01:28:33.782
TRAVIS: Why don't we land on the roof

01:28:33.782 --> 01:28:35.221
and we all lay flat,

01:28:35.221 --> 01:28:36.365
except for the people that are going in,

01:28:36.365 --> 01:28:37.643
and you cast Invisibility.

01:28:37.643 --> 01:28:38.940
SAM: This is the exact 
conversation they had

01:28:38.940 --> 01:28:40.764
when they were about to go kill Osama.

01:28:40.764 --> 01:28:43.014
(all laugh)

01:28:45.316 --> 01:28:47.043
ORION: Wait, I have an idea.

01:28:47.043 --> 01:28:47.876
TRAVIS: Oh God.

01:28:49.553 --> 01:28:51.281
ORION: Is there enough weight
for me get on the carpet

01:28:51.281 --> 01:28:52.114
at this point?

01:28:52.114 --> 01:28:54.242
ASHLEY: This is fucking stressful.

01:28:54.242 --> 01:28:55.312
MATT: You can certainly try.

01:28:55.312 --> 01:28:57.474
There was weight, but you're not
aware of how much was on it.

01:28:57.474 --> 01:28:59.809
ORION: Yes I do, it's 1000 pounds.

01:28:59.809 --> 01:29:03.186
MATT: You don't know how much
weight is on there, total.

01:29:03.186 --> 01:29:05.743
ORION: Everybody, how much do you weigh?

01:29:05.743 --> 01:29:07.390
SAM: Don't ask a woman that!

01:29:07.390 --> 01:29:09.422
ORION: I'm sorry, Your Highness,
but I need to know.

01:29:09.422 --> 01:29:11.512
The idea is if, I can
step off on the carpet,

01:29:11.512 --> 01:29:13.818
and hang with you guys,

01:29:13.818 --> 01:29:17.514
then Grog you can float down to the

01:29:17.514 --> 01:29:20.854
whatchamacallit, and take Vax here,

01:29:20.854 --> 01:29:23.780
then I can, oh shit, I need
to be near you to cast it,

01:29:23.780 --> 01:29:26.248
damn it!
(all laugh)

01:29:26.248 --> 01:29:27.186
MARISHA: Let's just land on the roof.

01:29:27.186 --> 01:29:28.361
ASHLEY: Let's land on the roof.

01:29:28.361 --> 01:29:32.326
LIAM: We're gonna go in, we're
gonna hit the roof,

01:29:32.326 --> 01:29:34.219
you turn me invisible,
he turns him invisible,

01:29:34.219 --> 01:29:37.102
you guys light up the
night, and we just do it,

01:29:37.102 --> 01:29:37.935
we just gotta go.

01:29:37.935 --> 01:29:38.768
ASHLEY: We're lighting up now?

01:29:38.768 --> 01:29:40.872
SAM: You light up on the roof?

01:29:40.872 --> 01:29:42.717
Let's look for access first.

01:29:42.717 --> 01:29:44.230
Don't light up 'til we give the go aside.

01:29:44.230 --> 01:29:45.320
ASHLEY: We're still not safe stealthy.

01:29:45.320 --> 01:29:46.644
ORION: We need to wait before we light up.

01:29:46.644 --> 01:29:50.158
LIAM: If anyone takes notice,
then turn off the lights.

01:29:50.158 --> 01:29:51.055
SAM: By the way--

01:29:51.055 --> 01:29:53.725
TALIESIN: Do not light up until you see the black

01:29:53.725 --> 01:29:54.934
or greens of their eyes.

01:29:54.934 --> 01:29:56.934
SAM: By the way, Clarota--

01:29:57.861 --> 01:30:00.812
Clarota you have definitely
picked the right people

01:30:00.812 --> 01:30:01.979
to assist you.

01:30:04.080 --> 01:30:05.728
MATT: There's no verbal response,

01:30:05.728 --> 01:30:09.720
but you do just emotionally
sense a slight hint of regret.

01:30:09.720 --> 01:30:11.992
(all laugh)

01:30:11.992 --> 01:30:13.743
MATT: Emanating from the mind flayer.

01:30:13.743 --> 01:30:14.910
SAM: We got this!

01:30:16.201 --> 01:30:17.905
All right, let's go land on the roof.

01:30:17.905 --> 01:30:20.413
LIAM: All right, let's do it.

01:30:20.413 --> 01:30:21.742
MATT: You guys descend.

01:30:21.742 --> 01:30:22.825
ORION: Down, down.

01:30:23.764 --> 01:30:25.907
MATT: Eagle flies down, you both,
(wind rushing),

01:30:25.907 --> 01:30:26.962
as part of the landing,

01:30:26.962 --> 01:30:29.330
everyone make a secondary stealth check.

01:30:29.330 --> 01:30:31.004
TALIESIN and MARISHA: We still have that plus 10?

01:30:31.004 --> 01:30:32.192
MATT: You still have the spell.

01:30:32.192 --> 01:30:33.599
ORION: Oh yes!

01:30:33.599 --> 01:30:34.432
MARISHA: Oh, that was cocked.

01:30:34.432 --> 01:30:35.573
TALIESIN: Yeah!

01:30:35.573 --> 01:30:36.406
MARISHA: Oh, no!

01:30:38.007 --> 01:30:39.663
TALIESIN: You're a terrible person.

01:30:39.663 --> 01:30:40.817
SAM: 30.

01:30:40.817 --> 01:30:41.650
ORION: 20.

01:30:43.133 --> 01:30:46.868
MARISHA: I'm like those boobies, that
crash land when they fall.

01:30:46.868 --> 01:30:47.701
MATT: You rolled at disadvantage?

01:30:47.701 --> 01:30:49.632
MARISHA: Well, I rolled a one.

01:30:49.632 --> 01:30:50.922
MATT: Okay.

01:30:50.922 --> 01:30:51.941
Two failures.

01:30:51.941 --> 01:30:53.441
TALIESIN: That's a 15, 29.

01:30:55.511 --> 01:30:56.721
TRAVIS: 23.
ASHLEY: 21.

01:30:56.721 --> 01:30:57.759
LIAM: 28.

01:30:57.759 --> 01:31:01.342
MATT: Pass Without A Trace is the saving grace.

01:31:02.549 --> 01:31:06.099
A bit of a harsh landing,
from your perspective,

01:31:06.099 --> 01:31:09.884
but thankfully you have two
small gnomes to break your fall.

01:31:09.884 --> 01:31:11.697
ASHLEY and SAM: (groan)

01:31:11.697 --> 01:31:14.515
MATT: You drag them a little bit
across the stonework on the top.

01:31:14.515 --> 01:31:15.633
It's not stonework, actually.

01:31:15.633 --> 01:31:17.377
Most of this whole thing, is stonework,

01:31:17.377 --> 01:31:21.387
it looks like the roof
of this is made of

01:31:21.387 --> 01:31:23.720
like a thick scavenged wood.

01:31:25.978 --> 01:31:27.076
Whether it was taken from the surface

01:31:27.076 --> 01:31:28.133
or from the mines itself,

01:31:28.133 --> 01:31:30.820
it is just wooden planks
that are all keeping--

01:31:30.820 --> 01:31:32.540
ASHLEY: Let's go in through the roof.

01:31:32.540 --> 01:31:34.370
TALIESIN: It's reclaimed, it's very nice.

01:31:34.370 --> 01:31:36.214
LIAM: If that thing sees us, though,

01:31:36.214 --> 01:31:37.800
it could be game over.

01:31:37.800 --> 01:31:39.246
I still think we should stick to the plan

01:31:39.246 --> 01:31:40.525
of blinding it.

01:31:40.525 --> 01:31:41.591
ORION: Yeah, do it.

01:31:41.591 --> 01:31:43.450
SAM: So some of us need to go inside.

01:31:43.450 --> 01:31:44.462
LIAM: You and I.

01:31:44.462 --> 01:31:49.363
TRAVIS: Yeah, the two go inside, and if shit
goes down, we light it up.

01:31:49.363 --> 01:31:52.527
LIAM: I will fucking yell into my
earring if shit goes down,

01:31:52.527 --> 01:31:54.145
and you guys gotta pray for me.

01:31:54.145 --> 01:31:54.978
TRAVIS: Go find shit!

01:31:54.978 --> 01:31:58.282
SAM: We look around for any roof access.

01:31:58.282 --> 01:31:59.882
TRAVIS: Come on, Chip 'n' Dale.

01:31:59.882 --> 01:32:01.967
MATT: Looking around, there is no roof entrance.

01:32:01.967 --> 01:32:04.163
It looks like it is
purely a functional roof

01:32:04.163 --> 01:32:06.704
for any weathering, rocks,

01:32:06.704 --> 01:32:08.674
you do see there are a few small rocks

01:32:08.674 --> 01:32:12.266
and pieces of cavern that
may have plummeted here.

01:32:12.266 --> 01:32:13.953
SAM: No chimneys.

01:32:13.953 --> 01:32:15.076
MATT: No chimneys, no nothing,

01:32:15.076 --> 01:32:16.401
there doesn't appear to be a fireplace,

01:32:16.401 --> 01:32:18.982
or any sort of interior like that.

01:32:18.982 --> 01:32:22.662
Glancing over the sides, you
can see that on the floor--

01:32:22.662 --> 01:32:25.415
You can't really tell if
there's two floors or not,

01:32:25.415 --> 01:32:28.158
it looks tall enough to have two floors,

01:32:28.158 --> 01:32:29.463
but you don't see a set of windows

01:32:29.463 --> 01:32:31.842
or anything that belies that to you.

01:32:31.842 --> 01:32:34.333
May just be a really tall single floor.

01:32:34.333 --> 01:32:36.991
But there are a couple
of small window openings,

01:32:36.991 --> 01:32:40.824
one on each side of-- 
[static]

01:32:42.312 --> 01:32:44.897
SAM: We're gonna go--

01:32:44.897 --> 01:32:47.037
LIAM: Tiberius, could you do me a favor

01:32:47.037 --> 01:32:49.341
of making me disappear?

01:32:49.341 --> 01:32:52.468
ORION: Yes, when I do this, though,
it's going to be very cool.

01:32:52.468 --> 01:32:54.394
(all laugh)

01:32:54.394 --> 01:32:56.745
LIAM: Holy shit, where are my hands?

01:32:56.745 --> 01:32:57.747
ORION: Right?

01:32:57.747 --> 01:32:59.393
MATT: You immediately disappear from view.

01:32:59.393 --> 01:33:01.818
You currently, visually do not exist.

01:33:01.818 --> 01:33:03.003
MARISHA: And you still have my buff.

01:33:03.003 --> 01:33:04.378
TRAVIS: We're like, flat on the roof, right?

01:33:04.378 --> 01:33:06.551
MATT: You guys are all on the
roof now, you're fine.

01:33:06.551 --> 01:33:07.571
Your Fly spell vanishes,

01:33:07.571 --> 01:33:09.398
you feel your weight
return to you for a second.

01:33:09.398 --> 01:33:10.723
For a split moment you're a little sad,

01:33:10.723 --> 01:33:11.556
'cause you were having fun.

01:33:11.556 --> 01:33:12.389
TRAVIS: Oh.

01:33:12.389 --> 01:33:13.571
(all laugh)

01:33:13.571 --> 01:33:15.724
TRAVIS: I was a dancer.

01:33:15.724 --> 01:33:18.604
SAM: We can see the window,
we pick one of the sides,

01:33:18.604 --> 01:33:20.281
I don't know, west side.

01:33:20.281 --> 01:33:21.188
MATT: West side!

01:33:21.188 --> 01:33:23.021
SAM: Is it a single pane?

01:33:23.958 --> 01:33:26.041
Is it an openable window?

01:33:27.188 --> 01:33:29.970
MATT: As you glance over, it is just an opening.

01:33:29.970 --> 01:33:31.448
There is no glass.

01:33:31.448 --> 01:33:32.321
There is nothing blocking the way.

01:33:32.321 --> 01:33:35.962
It is about roughly big enough to fit

01:33:35.962 --> 01:33:39.144
a normal-sized half-elf or human.

01:33:39.144 --> 01:33:42.311
LIAM: I take Scanlan by the scruff, and

01:33:43.286 --> 01:33:44.935
swing him down.

01:33:44.935 --> 01:33:47.410
SAM: Oh, I turn invisible.

01:33:47.410 --> 01:33:49.572
MATT: As you grab him and
you're bringing him down,

01:33:49.572 --> 01:33:50.512
you cast Invisibility on yourself,

01:33:50.512 --> 01:33:51.555
you both vanish now,

01:33:51.555 --> 01:33:53.227
all the rest of you are
kind of holding your breath,

01:33:53.227 --> 01:33:55.052
hoping that now that you don't
know what's happening,

01:33:55.052 --> 01:33:56.417
it's gonna go well.

01:33:56.417 --> 01:33:58.492
LIAM: I'm scaling in after him.

01:33:58.492 --> 01:34:01.156
LIAM: Go ahead and just make
an acrobatics check.

01:34:01.156 --> 01:34:03.697
SAM: Don't roll a one, please don't drop me.

01:34:03.697 --> 01:34:04.530
LIAM: 18.

01:34:04.530 --> 01:34:05.902
MATT: All right, yeah, you're good.

01:34:05.902 --> 01:34:07.719
You gingerly scale down the wall,

01:34:07.719 --> 01:34:10.086
the stones thankfully are

01:34:10.086 --> 01:34:11.464
just haphazardly put together,

01:34:11.464 --> 01:34:13.311
where there's enough grip
space for you to catch on.

01:34:13.311 --> 01:34:15.283
SAM: I have a climbing kit!

01:34:15.283 --> 01:34:16.116
(all laugh)

01:34:16.116 --> 01:34:16.949
LIAM: We're in, we're in.

01:34:16.949 --> 01:34:18.518
MATT: Little late for that, but okay.

01:34:18.518 --> 01:34:20.561
(all laugh)

01:34:20.561 --> 01:34:22.525
MATT: You lower him down, you bring him inside,

01:34:22.525 --> 01:34:25.061
you step down through the opening,

01:34:25.061 --> 01:34:28.428
into the center of the hallway.

01:34:28.428 --> 01:34:29.400
SAM: We can't talk to each other.

01:34:29.400 --> 01:34:31.345
TRAVIS: Yes we get a map, finally!

01:34:31.345 --> 01:34:32.637
SAM: We can't signal each other,

01:34:32.637 --> 01:34:34.858
and we don't know where each other is.

01:34:34.858 --> 01:34:36.200
I hold his hand.

01:34:36.200 --> 01:34:37.328
(all laugh)

01:34:37.328 --> 01:34:40.639
LIAM: We're holding hands, I'm
leaning way down on the side.

01:34:40.639 --> 01:34:42.370
TRAVIS: 'Course you are.

01:34:42.370 --> 01:34:44.658
LIAM: Sam and I have done this before.

01:34:44.658 --> 01:34:46.241
ORION: I use my earring.

01:34:48.898 --> 01:34:52.086
SAM: I'm not gonna talk back to
you, so whatever you say.

01:34:52.086 --> 01:34:54.676
ORION: Just to remind you of how
these particular things work,

01:34:54.676 --> 01:34:57.663
I'm not actually talking right now.

01:34:57.663 --> 01:35:02.614
So you can just talk to each
other through the rings.

01:35:05.760 --> 01:35:07.180
MATT: As the two of you step into this room,

01:35:07.180 --> 01:35:08.013
you look about you,

01:35:08.013 --> 01:35:11.525
and there are some ramshackle,
makeshift beds in the room.

01:35:11.525 --> 01:35:13.169
Five to be exact, from right to left.

01:35:13.169 --> 01:35:14.558
This appears to be one portion

01:35:14.558 --> 01:35:18.115
of a barracks-type sleeping arrangement.

01:35:18.115 --> 01:35:19.812
Beds are empty, they're kind of tossed,

01:35:19.812 --> 01:35:20.883
they're not like well-kept or anything.

01:35:20.883 --> 01:35:21.962
There's sheets kind of tossed about,

01:35:21.962 --> 01:35:24.245
and it smells awful in here, but it--

01:35:24.245 --> 01:35:27.595
LIAM: First, I just heard
Tiberius' voice in my head.

01:35:27.595 --> 01:35:29.825
So I'm going to test it out and think.

01:35:29.825 --> 01:35:31.788
Scanlan, can you hear me?

01:35:31.788 --> 01:35:33.205
SAM: Can I hear him?

01:35:34.104 --> 01:35:34.987
MATT: From?

01:35:34.987 --> 01:35:38.665
LIAM: I heard Tiberius whispering about.

01:35:38.665 --> 01:35:41.192
SAM: From thoughts only, can I hear him?

01:35:41.192 --> 01:35:42.547
MATT: No.

01:35:42.547 --> 01:35:46.714
LIAM: I tug on his hand to keep
going into the barracks.

01:35:49.701 --> 01:35:53.183
SAM: I notice that his hand
is weirdly cold and sweaty.

01:35:53.183 --> 01:35:54.984
MATT: Yeah, not weirdly.

01:35:54.984 --> 01:35:57.265
LIAM: You just lean to
live with the stage fright,

01:35:57.265 --> 01:35:59.182
you never move past it.

01:36:01.521 --> 01:36:02.920
Should we pause right now?

01:36:02.920 --> 01:36:04.217
MARISHA: You didn't bring your stuff?

01:36:04.217 --> 01:36:05.641
LAURA: I didn't have it!

01:36:05.641 --> 01:36:06.801
ORION: Come on in!

01:36:06.801 --> 01:36:09.062
LIAM: Look, my sister's here.

01:36:09.062 --> 01:36:10.674
LAURA: Hello!

01:36:10.674 --> 01:36:13.113
LIAM: We'll make it work.

01:36:13.113 --> 01:36:14.249
We'll bring you up to speed later,

01:36:14.249 --> 01:36:16.544
you're on the roof of
Osama Bin Laden's house.

01:36:16.544 --> 01:36:17.825
(all laugh)

01:36:17.825 --> 01:36:19.946
LIAM: So question for the DM, I'm invisible.

01:36:19.946 --> 01:36:23.416
Do I need to stealth, do I stealth?

01:36:23.416 --> 01:36:24.696
MATT: There's still a stealth
check 'cause you're invisible,

01:36:24.696 --> 01:36:27.443
but noise is still a factor.

01:36:27.443 --> 01:36:30.078
You just have 
advantage on your stealth check.

01:36:30.078 --> 01:36:33.178
LIAM: So, I think we should probably stealth.

01:36:33.178 --> 01:36:34.636
And start moving in.

01:36:34.636 --> 01:36:36.239
SAM: Yeah, that's, we tug each other.

01:36:36.239 --> 01:36:40.591
MATT: Beyond being invisible, you
guys make your stealth check.

01:36:40.591 --> 01:36:44.118
SAM: I mean, I'm invisible,
and I rolled a five.

01:36:44.118 --> 01:36:45.159
MATT: You have an advantage, you roll twice.

01:36:45.159 --> 01:36:48.254
'Cause you're both invisible.

01:36:48.254 --> 01:36:49.087
SAM: 13.

01:36:49.087 --> 01:36:49.921
LIAM: 20.

01:36:49.921 --> 01:36:51.073
MATT: All right.

01:36:51.073 --> 01:36:52.507
You both feel you're stealthed,

01:36:52.507 --> 01:36:54.981
there is one opening into a hallway here.

01:36:54.981 --> 01:36:56.630
LIAM: We have, does anyone have a laser light?

01:36:56.630 --> 01:36:57.463
TRAVIS: Yep.

01:36:57.463 --> 01:36:58.296
LIAM: All right.

01:36:58.296 --> 01:37:00.129
TRAVIS: Squeeze it together.

01:37:01.863 --> 01:37:03.353
Press the little button.

01:37:03.353 --> 01:37:04.339
LIAM: Squeeze it together?

01:37:04.339 --> 01:37:05.232
Ah, there we go.

01:37:05.232 --> 01:37:08.662
Okay so we're going to go down here.

01:37:08.662 --> 01:37:10.598
MATT: Down to this one.

01:37:10.598 --> 01:37:11.431
As you guys step out,

01:37:11.431 --> 01:37:14.772
you can see immediately
there are two duergar guards

01:37:14.772 --> 01:37:16.858
right by a door that leads
to a central chamber.

01:37:16.858 --> 01:37:18.753
LIAM: So we're gonna go this way.

01:37:18.753 --> 01:37:19.586
MATT: All right.

01:37:22.139 --> 01:37:23.972
Immediately you see--

01:37:26.183 --> 01:37:28.595
TRAVIS: I like how you guys have
different-colored lightsabers.

01:37:28.595 --> 01:37:30.391
MATT: Two more Duergar guards.

01:37:30.391 --> 01:37:33.917
TRAVIS: (lightsaber noises)

01:37:33.917 --> 01:37:36.153
LIAM: All right, I'm inching up,

01:37:36.153 --> 01:37:37.350
I'm pulling Scanlan behind me,

01:37:37.350 --> 01:37:39.779
but I'm inching up to this
door, just peeking through,

01:37:39.779 --> 01:37:40.909
seeing what I can see.

01:37:40.909 --> 01:37:42.667
MATT: Okay, looking inside, you
can see these small symbols,

01:37:42.667 --> 01:37:44.978
basically just red stone, the glow stone,

01:37:44.978 --> 01:37:47.367
that lights the underground caverns here

01:37:47.367 --> 01:37:49.630
and in a large portion of Kraghammer,

01:37:49.630 --> 01:37:52.334
are just embedded in the
wall in a small sconce.

01:37:52.334 --> 01:37:54.739
Peering through here, you
see one against the wall,

01:37:54.739 --> 01:37:56.790
you also see along the edges here,

01:37:56.790 --> 01:37:59.103
what looks to be racks of spears and pikes

01:37:59.103 --> 01:38:02.770
and hammers and various war
accoutrements of weapons,

01:38:02.770 --> 01:38:05.363
just hanging, and there's a set of armor,

01:38:05.363 --> 01:38:07.280
over a small, wooden

01:38:10.042 --> 01:38:12.746
arrangement, the armor itself
is just being stored there.

01:38:12.746 --> 01:38:16.163
This looks to be like a fast-grab armory.

01:38:17.815 --> 01:38:18.648
LIAM: Okay.

01:38:19.774 --> 01:38:23.223
I pull Scanlan by the hand,
and we enter into this room.

01:38:23.223 --> 01:38:25.649
SAM: This is so romantic.

01:38:25.649 --> 01:38:28.304
LIAM: It's just like
the day we met, Sam.

01:38:28.304 --> 01:38:29.197
MAT: You guys enter.

01:38:29.197 --> 01:38:32.694
LIAM: Quietly walking this way.

01:38:32.694 --> 01:38:34.705
We're past the door, that
looks like the front door.

01:38:34.705 --> 01:38:36.619
MATT: It is the front door,
it is currently closed, though.

01:38:36.619 --> 01:38:37.787
LIAM: We're gonna keep going this way.

01:38:37.787 --> 01:38:41.287
SAM: Oh man, we're doing-- we're flanking!

01:38:42.928 --> 01:38:45.339
MATT: Just come out this way.

01:38:45.339 --> 01:38:47.506
There is one duergar here.

01:38:48.658 --> 01:38:51.243
There doesn't appear to
be a doorway or entrance

01:38:51.243 --> 01:38:54.102
to the central chamber on
this side of the hallway.

01:38:54.102 --> 01:38:55.677
SAM: That's pretty good.

01:38:55.677 --> 01:38:57.579
LIAM: I still have the pitch in a bucket.

01:38:57.579 --> 01:39:00.564
The shit in a bucket
in my hand, by the way.

01:39:00.564 --> 01:39:02.590
SAM: We can take these guys,
I'm not worried about that.

01:39:02.590 --> 01:39:04.257
LIAM: But we'd make noise.

01:39:05.574 --> 01:39:10.087
How far apart are the two
duergar standing in that door?

01:39:10.087 --> 01:39:12.549
MATT: They're about five feet
apart, just enough space,

01:39:12.549 --> 01:39:15.966
like one is on each side of the doorway.

01:39:18.045 --> 01:39:18.878
LIAM: Okay.

01:39:21.081 --> 01:39:21.914
SAM: Wait.

01:39:23.833 --> 01:39:25.670
What are those red things right there?

01:39:25.670 --> 01:39:28.058
MATT: Those are the small sconces
with the glow stone,

01:39:28.058 --> 01:39:29.806
the red stone that lights the--

01:39:29.806 --> 01:39:31.475
SAM: So we're trying to get there.

01:39:31.475 --> 01:39:33.934
ORION: -- with Greater Invisibility,
so you can attack,

01:39:33.934 --> 01:39:36.270
and you'll still be invisible.

01:39:36.270 --> 01:39:40.020
LIAM: I pull a gold coin out of my pocket,

01:39:43.181 --> 01:39:45.514
and throw it in this corner.

01:39:46.799 --> 01:39:48.415
SAM: This is straight up Metal Gear.

01:39:48.415 --> 01:39:51.279
(all laugh)

01:39:51.279 --> 01:39:55.249
MATT: Go ahead and just make a
general dexterity check.

01:39:55.249 --> 01:39:57.906
LIAM: And because of Keyleth, I
have advantage, correct?

01:39:57.906 --> 01:39:58.997
MATT: Yes.

01:39:58.997 --> 01:39:59.830
ORION: Sure do.

01:40:01.430 --> 01:40:03.377
LIAM: So this is, what is this?

01:40:03.377 --> 01:40:06.297
MATT: Just a dexterity modifier.

01:40:06.297 --> 01:40:07.758
LIAM: So that's a 17.

01:40:07.758 --> 01:40:09.175
MATT: All right, you--

01:40:11.265 --> 01:40:13.322
(coin ringing)

01:40:13.322 --> 01:40:16.551
Ringing sound, both of the
duergar kinda look over.

01:40:16.551 --> 01:40:18.609
They look at each other.

01:40:18.609 --> 01:40:20.551
Grunt for a second.

01:40:20.551 --> 01:40:22.367
This one nods her head
and begins walking over

01:40:22.367 --> 01:40:24.566
to inspect it, this one stays at its post.

01:40:24.566 --> 01:40:26.071
MARISHA: (Metal Gear voice) Must have been my 
imagination.

01:40:26.071 --> 01:40:28.321
(all laugh)

01:40:29.905 --> 01:40:32.155
LIAM: I pull Scanlan behind me,

01:40:34.153 --> 01:40:37.236
and tiptoe right behind this asshole.

01:40:39.049 --> 01:40:41.062
TRAVIS: Do it! Put it in him!

01:40:41.062 --> 01:40:44.086
LIAM: And take out my vorpal blade.

01:40:44.086 --> 01:40:45.749
And reach out and grab him by the hair

01:40:45.749 --> 01:40:47.055
and stick it in the back of his neck.

01:40:47.055 --> 01:40:48.523
SAM: You got my dice.

01:40:48.523 --> 01:40:50.707
MATT: All right, so, as you reach up,

01:40:50.707 --> 01:40:53.861
you grasp the back of this really nasty,

01:40:53.861 --> 01:40:56.063
wiry, thick duergar hair--

01:40:56.063 --> 01:40:57.228
LIAM: I'm so tense right now.

01:40:57.228 --> 01:41:00.702
MATT: You yank the head back, and
take the base of the blade,

01:41:00.702 --> 01:41:03.180
go ahead and make an attack roll.

01:41:03.180 --> 01:41:04.077
It's a surprise roll,

01:41:04.077 --> 01:41:06.979
so you have an advantage on the attack.

01:41:06.979 --> 01:41:07.812
LIAM: Okay, good.

01:41:07.812 --> 01:41:09.176
MATT: I believe you have a bonus too,

01:41:09.176 --> 01:41:11.177
if you get the attack.

01:41:11.177 --> 01:41:12.010
LIAM: Yes.

01:41:12.010 --> 01:41:12.843
MARISHA: Sneak attack?

01:41:12.843 --> 01:41:14.093
LIAM: Well, I get--

01:41:14.932 --> 01:41:16.548
Yes, I get

01:41:16.548 --> 01:41:20.810
advantage, but you can't triple
up on advantage I believe?

01:41:20.810 --> 01:41:21.999
(loud bang offscreen)

01:41:21.999 --> 01:41:22.832
SAM: What was that?

01:41:22.832 --> 01:41:25.165
MATT: That was to freak you out.

01:41:26.194 --> 01:41:27.541
All right, so just double-checking here

01:41:27.541 --> 01:41:28.908
as part of your ability.

01:41:28.908 --> 01:41:33.075
SAM: Remember every 50 subscribers
gets a free giveaway.

01:41:33.952 --> 01:41:36.315
ORION: Subscribe now, kids.

01:41:36.315 --> 01:41:37.394
ASHLEY: What is that smile?

01:41:37.394 --> 01:41:39.144
MATT: If you score it, and the creature 
is surprised,

01:41:39.144 --> 01:41:40.397
it is a critical hit,
that's the other thing

01:41:40.397 --> 01:41:41.230
I was going to mention.

01:41:41.230 --> 01:41:42.063
LIAM: Thank you.

01:41:42.063 --> 01:41:45.123
So this isn't a dexterity
check, this is an attack.

01:41:45.123 --> 01:41:47.351
MATT: This is an attack.

01:41:47.351 --> 01:41:48.285
LIAM: Okay.

01:41:48.285 --> 01:41:49.535
So that's a 26.

01:41:51.126 --> 01:41:52.903
MATT: That is going to hit, and
that is a critical hit.

01:41:52.903 --> 01:41:54.280
Go ahead and roll damage with Sneak Attack.

01:41:54.280 --> 01:41:55.113
TALIESIN: Yeah!

01:41:56.128 --> 01:41:57.295
LAURA: Die die die.

01:41:58.864 --> 01:42:00.739
LIAM: I'm sweating.

01:42:00.739 --> 01:42:02.893
Okay, that's two plus seven is nine.

01:42:02.893 --> 01:42:05.810
That's nine, that's just that part.

01:42:06.837 --> 01:42:08.298
Six.

01:42:08.298 --> 01:42:09.726
Seven.

01:42:09.726 --> 01:42:11.088
Nine.

01:42:11.088 --> 01:42:11.921
14.

01:42:13.121 --> 01:42:13.954
And 19.

01:42:15.852 --> 01:42:17.903
Which is, what's doubled,
the Sneak Attack damage?

01:42:17.903 --> 01:42:19.541
MATT: The Sneak Attack damage
and the dice damage.

01:42:19.541 --> 01:42:22.931
MATT: And the dice damage, 19 plus, is 26,

01:42:22.931 --> 01:42:24.069
52.

01:42:24.069 --> 01:42:24.996
MARISHA: Oh!

01:42:24.996 --> 01:42:25.854
TALIESIN: Whoa!

01:42:25.854 --> 01:42:28.616
MATT: As you pull the head back,
you can hear a slight,

01:42:28.616 --> 01:42:31.119
a slight (gurgles) is about as much noise

01:42:31.119 --> 01:42:33.157
as can make it out before the blade just,

01:42:33.157 --> 01:42:34.723
right out the front of its throat,

01:42:34.723 --> 01:42:36.375
blocking any passage of the air.

01:42:36.375 --> 01:42:38.521
As you hold it, you twist the blade,

01:42:38.521 --> 01:42:39.464
it goes limp in your hand,

01:42:39.464 --> 01:42:40.816
but you catch it and
keep holding it there,

01:42:40.816 --> 01:42:42.187
so it doesn't make any noise.

01:42:42.187 --> 01:42:43.875
You're now clutching a dead duergar.

01:42:43.875 --> 01:42:45.511
SAM: Easy, easy.

01:42:45.511 --> 01:42:47.678
ASHLEY: (shushes) Night-night.

01:42:49.100 --> 01:42:49.933
LAURA: Oh yeah!

01:42:49.933 --> 01:42:51.534
TRAVIS: Lean him up against the wall!
Like he's standing there.

01:42:51.534 --> 01:42:52.367
LIAM: Just had a thought,

01:42:52.367 --> 01:42:55.545
I'm going to sit him
back against the wall,

01:42:55.545 --> 01:42:58.695
and let him slide against
it, and grab Scanlan,

01:42:58.695 --> 01:43:00.195
and into the room.

01:43:01.949 --> 01:43:03.926
MATT: Into this room?

01:43:03.926 --> 01:43:05.866
MARISHA: There's Scanlan.

01:43:05.866 --> 01:43:08.365
TALIESIN: He's still standing up, kind of.

01:43:08.365 --> 01:43:11.761
LAURA: Why is he leading
Scanlan, what's happening?

01:43:11.761 --> 01:43:14.205
LIAM: (shushes)

01:43:14.205 --> 01:43:18.370
SAM: While I'm invisible, I
look around for traps.

01:43:18.370 --> 01:43:21.335
I'm just gonna see if
there's any trap doors.

01:43:21.335 --> 01:43:24.016
MATT: Go ahead and make a perception check.

01:43:24.016 --> 01:43:25.113
SAM: Not great?

01:43:25.113 --> 01:43:26.196
LIAM: I got a 28.

01:43:27.751 --> 01:43:29.403
SAM: Nine.

01:43:29.403 --> 01:43:31.148
MATT: You notice no traps. What
you do notice, though,

01:43:31.148 --> 01:43:33.137
is there a giant kind of war room table,

01:43:33.137 --> 01:43:34.565
at the top of this raised platform.

01:43:34.565 --> 01:43:36.298
It's about six feet up,

01:43:36.298 --> 01:43:38.405
and there's a stairway
that leads up to it.

01:43:38.405 --> 01:43:40.155
You see at the table.

01:43:41.186 --> 01:43:43.130
One of the illithid mind flayers.

01:43:43.130 --> 01:43:46.555
The armored general that you saw before.

01:43:46.555 --> 01:43:48.387
And there are two other duergar currently

01:43:48.387 --> 01:43:50.246
at the table.

01:43:50.246 --> 01:43:51.867
TRAVIS: Nope, nope, nope, nope.

01:43:51.867 --> 01:43:54.125
ASHLEY: Stay invisible.

01:43:54.125 --> 01:43:55.773
SAM: We can't communicate.

01:43:55.773 --> 01:43:56.787
TRAVIS: You guys have got seconds until

01:43:56.787 --> 01:43:57.701
that other guard comes back.

01:43:57.701 --> 01:43:58.598
LIAM: We can't talk.

01:43:58.598 --> 01:43:59.582
MATT: You hear footsteps behind you.

01:43:59.582 --> 01:44:02.851
LIAM: I put the bucket of shit
into Scanlan's hands.

01:44:02.851 --> 01:44:04.344
LAURA: What are you doing?

01:44:04.344 --> 01:44:05.486
LIAM: Give him a little nudge,

01:44:05.486 --> 01:44:06.673
a gentle little nudge.

01:44:06.673 --> 01:44:08.441
SAM: I step forward into the room,

01:44:08.441 --> 01:44:10.501
and I hurl it at the fucker's face.

01:44:10.501 --> 01:44:12.131
The mind controllers.

01:44:12.131 --> 01:44:15.588
LIAM: And I'm rolling behind
him at the same time.

01:44:15.588 --> 01:44:18.339
Behind the illithid, ready to go.

01:44:18.339 --> 01:44:19.483
MATT: So I'll say you go up here as well?

01:44:19.483 --> 01:44:22.033
LIAM: Oh yeah, behind him, behind him.

01:44:22.033 --> 01:44:23.041
LAURA: What is happening?

01:44:23.041 --> 01:44:24.680
MATT: Make a stealth check, both of you.

01:44:24.680 --> 01:44:26.355
TRAVIS: Oh God, oh God.

01:44:26.355 --> 01:44:28.188
Oh God, over extended.

01:44:30.127 --> 01:44:31.868
SAM: Wait, do we get the plus ten to stealth?

01:44:31.868 --> 01:44:32.701
MATT: No.

01:44:32.701 --> 01:44:34.315
LIAM: Plus advantage, oh thank christ.

01:44:34.315 --> 01:44:35.307
SAM: 19.

01:44:35.307 --> 01:44:38.557
LIAM: Using Scanlan's advantage, so 16, 29.

01:44:39.842 --> 01:44:41.842
(sighs)

01:44:42.920 --> 01:44:43.753
MATT: Okay.

01:44:46.222 --> 01:44:48.288
You slink up behind, seemingly unnoticed.

01:44:48.288 --> 01:44:51.352
There's a slight twitch
to the mind flayer's head,

01:44:51.352 --> 01:44:53.029
for a second, as you go ahead,

01:44:53.029 --> 01:44:54.856
and take a big ol'--

01:44:54.856 --> 01:44:55.689
SAM: Bucket of shit!

01:44:55.689 --> 01:44:56.889
MATT: And fling it.

01:44:56.889 --> 01:44:58.651
(all laugh)

01:44:58.651 --> 01:45:01.722
MATT: Go ahead and make an attack roll.

01:45:01.722 --> 01:45:05.222
It would be, you're not proficient with

01:45:06.316 --> 01:45:08.793
goblin shit buckets, unfortunately,

01:45:08.793 --> 01:45:10.049
so go ahead and roll a d20,

01:45:10.049 --> 01:45:12.233
and add your dexterity.

01:45:12.233 --> 01:45:13.753
ORION: (groans)

01:45:13.753 --> 01:45:15.541
SAM: My dexterity?

01:45:15.541 --> 01:45:17.147
MATT: Dexterity or strength, whichever's
higher, strength higher?

01:45:17.147 --> 01:45:21.090
SAM: No, no, strength is not higher for me.

01:45:21.090 --> 01:45:22.075
Oh, it is higher!

01:45:22.075 --> 01:45:22.908
So 19.

01:45:23.953 --> 01:45:24.870
MATT: All righty.

01:45:26.254 --> 01:45:27.204
TALIESIN: Oh my God.

01:45:27.204 --> 01:45:29.981
MATT: You fling it as the Invisibility
spell wears off of you

01:45:29.981 --> 01:45:32.854
as part of the attack,
you fling the bucket.

01:45:32.854 --> 01:45:36.511
A spray of thick, green,
goblin fecal matter

01:45:36.511 --> 01:45:38.158
goes streaking through the air

01:45:38.158 --> 01:45:40.463
as the illithid turns, its eyes wide,

01:45:40.463 --> 01:45:42.956
to see you suddenly appear,

01:45:42.956 --> 01:45:45.882
and then suddenly see this
entire batch of thick goblin shit

01:45:45.882 --> 01:45:48.230
just (splashes) across its face.

01:45:48.230 --> 01:45:51.211
Suddenly you see his tentacles
writhing,

01:45:51.211 --> 01:45:54.241
as it screams, all of
you hear in your head

01:45:54.241 --> 01:45:55.383
a scream.

01:45:55.383 --> 01:45:57.677
LIAM: I'm stabbing, I'm stabbing!

01:45:57.677 --> 01:45:59.389
ORION: I cast Stoneskin immediately.

01:45:59.389 --> 01:46:01.505
MATT: As this happens, you cast Stoneskin,

01:46:01.505 --> 01:46:02.461
you go in for the blade,

01:46:02.461 --> 01:46:05.186
and you hear a counter voice in your mind.

01:46:05.186 --> 01:46:06.019
ASHLEY: Fuck.

01:46:06.019 --> 01:46:07.686
MATT: Clarota going, "Now."

01:46:08.867 --> 01:46:12.116
MARISHA: I cast Light on Grog's head!

01:46:12.116 --> 01:46:14.318
MATT: Your head comes to an extremely bright glow,

01:46:14.318 --> 01:46:15.662
all of you averting your gaze.

01:46:15.662 --> 01:46:17.459
LIAM: This is stealth, right? Stealth for me?

01:46:17.459 --> 01:46:19.703
MATT: No, you're invisible.

01:46:19.703 --> 01:46:20.939
LIAM: Oh, okay.

01:46:20.939 --> 01:46:22.329
SAM: Attack, attack, kill him!

01:46:22.329 --> 01:46:23.162
LIAM: 29! 29!

01:46:24.759 --> 01:46:26.536
MATT: That definitely rolls to
hit, you have surprise.

01:46:26.536 --> 01:46:27.485
Go ahead and roll.

01:46:27.485 --> 01:46:28.555
LIAM: That's a critical, right?

01:46:28.555 --> 01:46:29.706
I'm assassinating this mother fucker.

01:46:29.706 --> 01:46:30.539
MATT: It's a critical, technically. Yep.

01:46:31.880 --> 01:46:33.622
SAM: We're going for the general?

01:46:33.622 --> 01:46:36.455
LIAM: The illithid can control us all.

01:46:38.400 --> 01:46:39.593
ASHLEY: Should we go in?

01:46:39.593 --> 01:46:40.536
ORION: We don't know anything.

01:46:40.536 --> 01:46:41.697
MATT: So, roll damage on this.

01:46:41.697 --> 01:46:42.971
LIAM: Roll my damage.

01:46:42.971 --> 01:46:43.924
ORION: We just heard a scream.
Oh, we can act on that.

01:46:43.924 --> 01:46:44.886
TRAVIS: And I rage.

01:46:44.886 --> 01:46:45.800
MATT: Stone skin. Light on his head.

01:46:45.800 --> 01:46:46.958
TRAVIS: Rage.

01:46:46.958 --> 01:46:47.837
MATT: Going into a rage.

01:46:47.837 --> 01:46:48.788
ASHLEY: Daylight on my shield.

01:46:48.788 --> 01:46:49.836
MATT: Daylight on your shield.

01:46:49.836 --> 01:46:51.851
LAURA: I'm so happy to be here.

01:46:51.851 --> 01:46:54.612
(all laugh)

01:46:54.612 --> 01:46:56.330
MATT: I will say for the purposes of this battle,

01:46:56.330 --> 01:46:57.365
there is no Trinket here,

01:46:57.365 --> 01:47:00.471
because Trinket would not have fit
across the way to get there.

01:47:00.471 --> 01:47:01.304
LAURA: Okay.

01:47:01.304 --> 01:47:02.677
TRAVIS: Didn't you give her an arrow?

01:47:02.677 --> 01:47:05.415
TALIESIN: Yes, and you have an entrapment arrow 
now.

01:47:05.415 --> 01:47:07.396
LAURA: Okay, I get ready for that.

01:47:07.396 --> 01:47:08.313
LIAM: Okay, DM?

01:47:09.470 --> 01:47:10.451
62 into the back of his head.

01:47:11.523 --> 01:47:12.832
TALIESIN: Oh, shit!

01:47:12.832 --> 01:47:13.665
TRAVIS: 62?

01:47:14.602 --> 01:47:15.956
ASHLEY: How?

01:47:15.956 --> 01:47:17.206
LIAM: Critical hit.

01:47:18.168 --> 01:47:20.849
MATT: You take the blade, and
as it pierces the back--

01:47:20.849 --> 01:47:22.283
LIAM: Oh, it's a poison one by the way.

01:47:22.283 --> 01:47:23.653
ORION: Damn!

01:47:23.653 --> 01:47:25.290
MATT: It pierces the back of its skull,

01:47:25.290 --> 01:47:26.461
you feel the muscles in its neck

01:47:26.461 --> 01:47:29.579
tense in reaction to the blade,
but the blade slips past.

01:47:29.579 --> 01:47:32.081
You can see a gout of purplish-black blood

01:47:32.081 --> 01:47:32.997
begin to spill from its neck,

01:47:32.997 --> 01:47:35.280
as it instinctually reaches up,

01:47:35.280 --> 01:47:38.306
and pulls the blade from
the back of its head.

01:47:38.306 --> 01:47:40.003
What's the DC on the poison?

01:47:40.003 --> 01:47:41.420
LIAM: I have no idea.

01:47:42.982 --> 01:47:44.170
MATT: It should be on the blade info.

01:47:44.170 --> 01:47:45.503
LIAM: Poison dagger.

01:47:46.367 --> 01:47:47.200
TALIESIN: Fuck.

01:47:48.261 --> 01:47:49.094
Ah!

01:47:49.094 --> 01:47:52.041
LIAM: I think it's oh, it's 15.

01:47:52.041 --> 01:47:52.874
TALIESIN: This was a good plan.

01:47:52.874 --> 01:47:54.596
MATT: The poison does not seem to take effect,

01:47:54.596 --> 01:47:56.103
the body resists it.

01:47:56.103 --> 01:47:58.001
It is still alive.

01:47:58.001 --> 01:48:00.210
But it's clutching the back of its neck,

01:48:00.210 --> 01:48:02.588
as it turns around going (sputters),

01:48:02.588 --> 01:48:05.056
you can see its blood
spurting out of its mouth,

01:48:05.056 --> 01:48:07.425
and its eyes are now
just burning with rage.

01:48:07.425 --> 01:48:09.477
All the rest of these duergar are now reaching

01:48:09.477 --> 01:48:11.889
and pulling their weapons out.

01:48:11.889 --> 01:48:12.819
Everyone roll initiative.

01:48:12.819 --> 01:48:15.069
(all yell)

01:48:16.210 --> 01:48:18.155
LAURA: I don't have my stuff with me.

01:48:18.155 --> 01:48:19.658
LIAM: Natural 20.

01:48:19.658 --> 01:48:20.575
MATT: Oh, shit.

01:48:24.143 --> 01:48:26.673
SAM: Let's kill some bad guys.

01:48:26.673 --> 01:48:29.173
TRAVIS: I don't know what you're doing.

01:48:31.610 --> 01:48:32.777
MATT: All right, so.

01:48:34.381 --> 01:48:35.214
25 to 20?

01:48:36.291 --> 01:48:38.241
LIAM: 20. Natural 20.

01:48:38.241 --> 01:48:39.074
MATT: But you have no bonuses?

01:48:39.074 --> 01:48:40.585
You should have your dex bonus too.

01:48:40.585 --> 01:48:42.502
LIAM: Oh yeah, that's a 25.

01:48:43.457 --> 01:48:46.074
MATT: So, I'm gonna say you're
probably going in first, buddy.

01:48:46.074 --> 01:48:47.045
TALIESIN: Yeah!

01:48:47.045 --> 01:48:49.143
MATT: All right, 20, 25 to 20, anyone else?

01:48:49.143 --> 01:48:50.864
LAURA: Oh, I think I got like a 21.

01:48:50.864 --> 01:48:51.697
MATT: What'd you roll?

01:48:51.697 --> 01:48:52.758
LAURA: I got 16 plus--

01:48:52.758 --> 01:48:54.337
MATT: Yep, that'd be 21, yeah.

01:48:54.337 --> 01:48:55.504
All right, so.

01:49:00.795 --> 01:49:02.138
19, anyone?

01:49:02.138 --> 01:49:02.972
TALIESIN: 19.

01:49:02.972 --> 01:49:03.889
MATT: 19, nice.

01:49:06.910 --> 01:49:07.743
LAURA: No.

01:49:10.144 --> 01:49:10.977
TALIESIN: Gonna wing it.

01:49:10.977 --> 01:49:11.810
MATT: 18, anyone?

01:49:11.810 --> 01:49:12.643
TRAVIS: 18.

01:49:12.643 --> 01:49:13.476
MATT: Nice.

01:49:13.476 --> 01:49:14.448
ORION: I got 16.

01:49:14.448 --> 01:49:16.657
MARISHA: Do you have like a picture,

01:49:16.657 --> 01:49:18.800
or a file anywhere, saved of your--

01:49:18.800 --> 01:49:19.838
LAURA: I got jack shit!

01:49:19.838 --> 01:49:21.137
MARISHA: Of your sheet?

01:49:21.137 --> 01:49:23.367
LIAM: We snuck into the war camp.

01:49:23.367 --> 01:49:24.534
LAURA: We're in the war camp?

01:49:24.534 --> 01:49:27.135
LIAM: We all landed on the top
of their main building.

01:49:27.135 --> 01:49:28.952
MATT: So, what's your?

01:49:28.952 --> 01:49:30.388
SAM: 14.

01:49:30.388 --> 01:49:31.221
ORION: I have 16.

01:49:31.221 --> 01:49:32.388
MATT: 16, all right, so Tiberius.

01:49:33.639 --> 01:49:35.956
Scanlan, what was yours?

01:49:35.956 --> 01:49:37.148
ASHLEY: Nine.

01:49:37.148 --> 01:49:38.390
MARISHA: Also nine.

01:49:38.390 --> 01:49:39.934
ASHLEY: Not to brag.

01:49:39.934 --> 01:49:42.851
TRAVIS: Ashley's first two rolls were 20s.

01:49:44.034 --> 01:49:47.427
MATT: All right, top of the round
is Vax, with initiative.

01:49:47.427 --> 01:49:49.569
LIAM: I'm just gonna (grunts) in the
back of his head some more.

01:49:49.569 --> 01:49:51.111
I'm still invisible according to Tiberius'

01:49:51.111 --> 01:49:52.600
Greater Invisibility spell.

01:49:52.600 --> 01:49:56.253
ORION: No no no, as soon as I cast Stoneskin,

01:49:56.253 --> 01:49:57.192
you were attacking,

01:49:57.192 --> 01:49:58.495
that's why I said this is all going--

01:49:58.495 --> 01:50:00.127
MATT: You are now visible, you are not stealthed.

01:50:00.127 --> 01:50:01.845
LIAM: Stab him in the back of the head.

01:50:01.845 --> 01:50:05.625
For assassinate, do I get
the critical still here, DM?

01:50:05.625 --> 01:50:06.458
MATT: No.

01:50:06.458 --> 01:50:08.823
You've gotten the one hit, it
is completely aware of you,

01:50:08.823 --> 01:50:09.888
it is not a surprise attack.

01:50:09.888 --> 01:50:10.938
LIAM: So this is a 28.

01:50:10.938 --> 01:50:12.336
MATT: It is so aware of you,

01:50:12.336 --> 01:50:14.162
it has never been more
aware of you in its life.

01:50:14.162 --> 01:50:15.800
(all laugh)

01:50:15.800 --> 01:50:16.995
LIAM: I just rolled a 28.

01:50:16.995 --> 01:50:19.006
MATT: Okay, that definitely hits.

01:50:19.006 --> 01:50:21.654
Attacking with your off hand?

01:50:21.654 --> 01:50:23.626
LIAM: Oh, so this is my bonus attack?

01:50:23.626 --> 01:50:25.137
MATT: Yeah, you get the one attack,
then you get the bonus hand.

01:50:25.137 --> 01:50:26.887
Which is just dice damage.

01:50:27.869 --> 01:50:30.254
LIAM: Okay, this is fire.

01:50:30.254 --> 01:50:35.120
My flame tongue dagger, I
got two plus six is eight.

01:50:35.120 --> 01:50:36.537
MATT: Eight?
LIAM: Eight.

01:50:37.416 --> 01:50:38.249
MATT: All right.

01:50:40.637 --> 01:50:42.237
And your other attack?

01:50:42.237 --> 01:50:43.070
Are you doing your bonus attack?

01:50:43.070 --> 01:50:44.262
LIAM: Was that the bonus attack?

01:50:44.262 --> 01:50:45.306
Or was that my main attack?

01:50:45.306 --> 01:50:47.391
MATT: This is your new combat round,
that was your main attack.

01:50:47.391 --> 01:50:50.515
LIAM: That's a nine, and here
comes my bonus attack.

01:50:50.515 --> 01:50:51.476
Okay, 14.

01:50:51.476 --> 01:50:52.309
MARISHA: Kill him.

01:50:52.309 --> 01:50:53.324
LIAM: 24.

01:50:53.324 --> 01:50:54.157
MATT: 24 hits.

01:50:55.711 --> 01:50:58.204
LIAM: Here comes my keen dagger.

01:50:58.204 --> 01:50:59.704
Which is an eight.

01:51:01.392 --> 01:51:02.225
MATT: Eight damage?

01:51:02.225 --> 01:51:03.058
LIAM: Yes.

01:51:03.058 --> 01:51:03.933
MATT: So the first strike,

01:51:03.933 --> 01:51:05.884
you swing across with
the flame tongue dagger.

01:51:05.884 --> 01:51:07.511
As it backs up, you put another gash

01:51:07.511 --> 01:51:10.592
across the front of its
neck and chest area.

01:51:10.592 --> 01:51:12.754
It reels back and is looking
at you with angry fury.

01:51:12.754 --> 01:51:14.832
You feel this coming shake,

01:51:14.832 --> 01:51:17.351
this horrible force of severe retribution

01:51:17.351 --> 01:51:20.298
coming to your mind, and
as you're bracing for it,

01:51:20.298 --> 01:51:21.571
you take your other blade,

01:51:21.571 --> 01:51:24.351
you see its mouth opens up
with frustration and anger

01:51:24.351 --> 01:51:25.738
as its tentacles kinda curl back,

01:51:25.738 --> 01:51:27.699
and just go in for the grab.

01:51:27.699 --> 01:51:29.907
You place the blade
squarely into that maw,

01:51:29.907 --> 01:51:32.048
you feel the scraping of its
teeth across your knuckles,

01:51:32.048 --> 01:51:32.881
but it doesn't matter,

01:51:32.881 --> 01:51:35.648
because whatever anger and
light was once in its face,

01:51:35.648 --> 01:51:36.680
goes dark and dull.

01:51:36.680 --> 01:51:38.229
(all cheer)

01:51:38.229 --> 01:51:39.633
MATT: As immediately it crumples to the ground,

01:51:39.633 --> 01:51:42.877
lifeless, pull the blade from the maw,

01:51:42.877 --> 01:51:44.003
mind flayer down.

01:51:44.003 --> 01:51:45.951
(all cheer)

01:51:45.951 --> 01:51:46.868
MARISHA: Yeah Vax!

01:51:48.133 --> 01:51:50.142
MATT: He was next, but not anymore.

01:51:50.142 --> 01:51:51.090
As it falls to the ground,

01:51:51.090 --> 01:51:54.340
all the rest of the duergar immediately

01:51:55.791 --> 01:51:57.338
have a reaction.

01:51:57.338 --> 01:51:58.675
We'll get to their turn in a second.

01:51:58.675 --> 01:51:59.705
Vex, you're up.

01:51:59.705 --> 01:52:01.232
So you're on the roof, up here right now.

01:52:01.232 --> 01:52:02.498
SAM: Gotta get inside first.

01:52:02.498 --> 01:52:04.194
LAURA: We have to run down in?

01:52:04.194 --> 01:52:06.383
MATT: Run down, you're on a wooden roof surface,

01:52:06.383 --> 01:52:08.780
you heard before there's an entrance here,

01:52:08.780 --> 01:52:09.613
and an entrance there.

01:52:09.613 --> 01:52:11.013
LIAM: Windows are swing-down-in-able.

01:52:11.013 --> 01:52:14.763
SAM: Unless Grog can just
tear through the roof.

01:52:16.846 --> 01:52:17.966
LAURA: What was your initiative?

01:52:17.966 --> 01:52:18.984
LIAM: It's wood.

01:52:18.984 --> 01:52:19.999
TALIESIN: You can hold initiative.

01:52:19.999 --> 01:52:21.360
LAURA: I guess I'll hold, I'll hold,

01:52:21.360 --> 01:52:23.285
to see what the hell's happening.

01:52:23.285 --> 01:52:25.469
MATT: So you hold on that.

01:52:25.469 --> 01:52:28.949
It is now this dude's turn, the general.

01:52:28.949 --> 01:52:31.177
He, unaffected by this, it seems,

01:52:31.177 --> 01:52:34.606
just angrily leaps on to
the table, runs across,

01:52:34.606 --> 01:52:38.662
(groans), and jumps down towards you.

01:52:38.662 --> 01:52:42.829
As he does, you see his
physical form seems to enlarge.

01:52:45.348 --> 01:52:47.989
His actual small dwarvish
form begins to swell,

01:52:47.989 --> 01:52:49.207
his muscles tense.

01:52:49.207 --> 01:52:50.544
He's about the size of a normal person,

01:52:50.544 --> 01:52:52.207
if not a little bigger right now.

01:52:52.207 --> 01:52:54.320
He comes at you with this giant black,

01:52:54.320 --> 01:52:56.320
jagged metal war hammer.

01:52:57.276 --> 01:52:59.778
(groans) Comes down to swing at you,

01:52:59.778 --> 01:53:02.952
as he comes down, you
see it burst into flame.

01:53:02.952 --> 01:53:04.814
There's fire now surrounding
the head of this war hammer

01:53:04.814 --> 01:53:05.970
as it arcs toward you.

01:53:05.970 --> 01:53:06.803
SAM: What?

01:53:08.399 --> 01:53:10.566
MATT: That is going to be a

01:53:12.918 --> 01:53:13.751
24 to hit.

01:53:13.751 --> 01:53:15.602
LIAM: Oh, it hits, but I use Uncanny Dodge

01:53:15.602 --> 01:53:18.280
to try to swoop out of
the way as best I can.

01:53:18.280 --> 01:53:20.280
MATT: All righty. You suffer--

01:53:23.089 --> 01:53:25.122
That would be...

01:53:25.122 --> 01:53:29.205
12 plus six fire damage,
so, 18, reduced to nine.

01:53:30.702 --> 01:53:32.752
You take nine damage from the strike.

01:53:32.752 --> 01:53:35.746
As it strikes down, it
goes for a back swing

01:53:35.746 --> 01:53:37.629
to attack you a second time.

01:53:37.629 --> 01:53:40.546
That is going to be a 15 versus AC.

01:53:41.563 --> 01:53:44.122
This time you just dodge
completely out of the way.

01:53:44.122 --> 01:53:45.412
Derge out of the way.

01:53:45.412 --> 01:53:46.284
MARISHA: Derge.

01:53:46.284 --> 01:53:48.231
LIAM: Er mah gerd, I derged.

01:53:48.231 --> 01:53:49.925
(all laugh)

01:53:49.925 --> 01:53:51.508
MATT: Percy, you're up.

01:53:52.498 --> 01:53:54.603
TALIESIN: Just in case, I'm going to push off

01:53:54.603 --> 01:53:55.717
and wait for Grog.

01:53:55.717 --> 01:53:57.738
So I'm holding my turn.

01:53:57.738 --> 01:54:00.074
MATT: Okay, Grog, your turn.

01:54:00.074 --> 01:54:01.520
TRAVIS: Right, so we're on the
roof of the thing, right?

01:54:01.520 --> 01:54:02.353
MATT: Correct, you are.

01:54:02.353 --> 01:54:05.777
TRAVIS: I'm in a rage, I take
the pot still on my head,

01:54:05.777 --> 01:54:07.224
and I pick up my ax,

01:54:07.224 --> 01:54:10.396
and I draw one gigantic
smash through the roof

01:54:10.396 --> 01:54:11.229
of the building.

01:54:11.229 --> 01:54:12.956
MATT: Go ahead and make a strength check.

01:54:12.956 --> 01:54:13.873
TALIESIN: God, yes.

01:54:15.245 --> 01:54:16.693
ORION: This is all you're good for.

01:54:16.693 --> 01:54:18.360
MARISHA: Yes, come on Grog.

01:54:19.277 --> 01:54:21.081
This is all you're good for.

01:54:21.081 --> 01:54:24.001
TRAVIS: 15.

01:54:24.001 --> 01:54:25.313
MATT: 15?
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:54:25.313 --> 01:54:26.423
MATT: All right.

01:54:26.423 --> 01:54:28.026
MARISHA: Come on.

01:54:28.026 --> 01:54:28.859
SAM: 15?

01:54:29.937 --> 01:54:32.115
MATT: You bring your ax up,

01:54:32.115 --> 01:54:33.464
you bring it down on
top as hard as you can,

01:54:33.464 --> 01:54:35.552
go ahead and roll ax damage.

01:54:35.552 --> 01:54:36.680
TRAVIS: Is that a d12?

01:54:36.680 --> 01:54:39.398
MATT: It's a d12 plus your strength modifier.

01:54:39.398 --> 01:54:41.329
Plus two 'cause you're raging.

01:54:41.329 --> 01:54:42.375
TRAVIS: Do I get advantage on that?

01:54:42.375 --> 01:54:43.208
MATT: No.

01:54:44.501 --> 01:54:45.334
TRAVIS: Seven.

01:54:45.334 --> 01:54:46.562
LAURA: Plus two 'cause you're raging.

01:54:46.562 --> 01:54:47.395
TRAVIS: Nine.

01:54:47.395 --> 01:54:48.560
MATT: Nine damage, okay.

01:54:48.560 --> 01:54:51.101
As you swing the ax down,
slam, it hits the wood.

01:54:51.101 --> 01:54:52.968
With the sheer weight of you there,

01:54:52.968 --> 01:54:54.646
and most of you guys conglomerated
at that point,

01:54:54.646 --> 01:54:57.857
the actual roof breaks open and splits,

01:54:57.857 --> 01:54:58.985
into a small space.

01:54:58.985 --> 01:55:01.872
You slide down in the process.

01:55:01.872 --> 01:55:04.400
ASHLEY: I jump on to Grog's foot.

01:55:04.400 --> 01:55:06.542
(all laugh)

01:55:06.542 --> 01:55:07.850
MATT: All right.

01:55:07.850 --> 01:55:10.812
Go ahead, both of you
make an acrobatics check.

01:55:10.812 --> 01:55:12.405
ASHLEY: Oh, I wouldn't have had to do it.

01:55:12.405 --> 01:55:14.840
All right, well, I'm in the building.

01:55:14.840 --> 01:55:16.385
TRAVIS: 21.

01:55:16.385 --> 01:55:17.218
MATT: Acrobatics check?

01:55:17.218 --> 01:55:18.051
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:55:18.051 --> 01:55:18.893
MATT: Pike?

01:55:18.893 --> 01:55:22.168
You have disadvantage 'cause
you're in plate armor.

01:55:22.168 --> 01:55:23.107
ASHLEY: Six.

01:55:23.107 --> 01:55:25.855
MATT: All right, so Grog, you
manage to land on your feet.

01:55:25.855 --> 01:55:28.256
Pike, you actually
plummet off and fall off

01:55:28.256 --> 01:55:30.036
to the side, right there.

01:55:30.036 --> 01:55:31.968
You are currently prone,
and from the fall,

01:55:31.968 --> 01:55:33.189
which you guys both dropped down,

01:55:33.189 --> 01:55:34.151
you managed to reduce the damage,

01:55:34.151 --> 01:55:38.149
but you from the fall, you take
eight points of fall damage.

01:55:38.149 --> 01:55:39.087
You are now flat on your back,

01:55:39.087 --> 01:55:42.074
the wind knocked out of you for a minute.

01:55:42.074 --> 01:55:43.325
SAM: Pike!

01:55:43.325 --> 01:55:44.494
ASHLEY: I'm okay, I'm okay!

01:55:44.494 --> 01:55:45.910
SAM: Oh okay, thank God.

01:55:45.910 --> 01:55:46.743
MATT: All right.

01:55:47.705 --> 01:55:51.288
That brings us now,
Vex and Percy are the same.

01:55:52.245 --> 01:55:54.114
TALIESIN: You first? Or should I go first?

01:55:54.114 --> 01:55:55.121
LAURA: Let's go down at the same time.

01:55:55.121 --> 01:55:56.879
TALIESIN: We'll go, we both jump
down at the same time.

01:55:56.879 --> 01:55:57.712
MATT: Both jump down,

01:55:57.712 --> 01:56:01.471
go ahead and make your
acrobatics checks, guys.

01:56:01.471 --> 01:56:02.304
TALIESIN: 20.

01:56:03.540 --> 01:56:05.022
LAURA: Oh, I rolled really bad.

01:56:05.022 --> 01:56:05.855
MATT: What did you roll?

01:56:05.855 --> 01:56:09.075
LAURA: I rolled a two, but I
add it to my acrobatics.

01:56:09.075 --> 01:56:10.094
MATT: Yes, which is?

01:56:10.094 --> 01:56:10.927
SAM: Which you don't know.

01:56:10.927 --> 01:56:12.485
LAURA: Which is like, I bet.

01:56:12.485 --> 01:56:13.747
MATT: Your acrobatics, as you're proficient in it,

01:56:13.747 --> 01:56:14.838
and you have plus five dex,

01:56:14.838 --> 01:56:16.647
so that would bring it to 11?

01:56:16.647 --> 01:56:17.480
LAURA: Yes.

01:56:17.480 --> 01:56:18.313
MATT: Or no, 12.

01:56:18.313 --> 01:56:19.171
LAURA: Yes.

01:56:19.171 --> 01:56:20.858
LIAM: Did you bring any Wheaton
power from the other room?

01:56:20.858 --> 01:56:23.258
(all laugh)

01:56:23.258 --> 01:56:24.917
MATT: You just barely land on your feet,

01:56:24.917 --> 01:56:27.227
you do take fall damage,
but you don't fall prone.

01:56:27.227 --> 01:56:29.987
You take eight points of fall damage.

01:56:29.987 --> 01:56:31.788
Percy, you manage to land fine,

01:56:31.788 --> 01:56:33.971
without any damage, on your feet.

01:56:33.971 --> 01:56:36.950
On the ground, both of you
kind of three-point landing.

01:56:36.950 --> 01:56:38.287
Avengers style.

01:56:38.287 --> 01:56:40.533
TALIESIN: Do I have time to get a shot off?

01:56:40.533 --> 01:56:43.283
MATT: You do, that was your movement.

01:56:44.125 --> 01:56:45.813
So what's the deal?

01:56:45.813 --> 01:56:47.651
TALIESIN: Wow, I'm taking a second,

01:56:47.651 --> 01:56:51.022
and I see that Vax is getting attacked,

01:56:51.022 --> 01:56:53.064
and I'm gonna just take a shot at the--

01:56:53.064 --> 01:56:55.743
The guy with the hammer.

01:56:55.743 --> 01:56:57.455
The biggest thing I see.

01:56:57.455 --> 01:57:00.910
MATT: Do you have your glasses or goggles on?

01:57:00.910 --> 01:57:02.891
TALIESIN: Yeah, that's right, I have a helmet.

01:57:02.891 --> 01:57:04.414
So yeah, I'm wearing the helmet.

01:57:04.414 --> 01:57:05.720
I'm cool with that.

01:57:05.720 --> 01:57:07.642
MATT: So go for it.

01:57:07.642 --> 01:57:09.059
LIAM: Do it, Starlord.

01:57:10.971 --> 01:57:12.314
TALIESIN: Ah! A natural 20.

01:57:12.314 --> 01:57:13.330
(all cheer)

01:57:13.330 --> 01:57:15.816
MATT: Against the general,
or one of the duergar?

01:57:15.816 --> 01:57:16.706
TALIESIN: The general.

01:57:16.706 --> 01:57:19.340
LIAM: The guy on the table attacking me.

01:57:19.340 --> 01:57:20.988
MATT: Yeah, you can just barely see him,

01:57:20.988 --> 01:57:22.193
the stairway is up there.

01:57:22.193 --> 01:57:24.198
TALIESIN: Doesn't matter, as long
as I have-- partial cover,

01:57:24.198 --> 01:57:25.031
it don't matter.

01:57:25.031 --> 01:57:26.123
MATT: Right, I know, and he does have,

01:57:26.123 --> 01:57:28.056
he has three-quarters cover
because of the distance,

01:57:28.056 --> 01:57:29.514
but you natural 20'd, so it doesn't matter.

01:57:29.514 --> 01:57:32.712
TALIESIN: I can ignore it, I ignore
three-quarters cover.

01:57:32.712 --> 01:57:33.830
MATT: You do, because--

01:57:33.830 --> 01:57:34.663
TALIESIN: I'm awesome.

01:57:34.663 --> 01:57:35.496
MATT: Yep.

01:57:35.496 --> 01:57:36.689
(all laugh)

01:57:36.689 --> 01:57:39.819
TALIESIN: So that's double 1d-- I should have gotten

01:57:39.819 --> 01:57:42.700
some bonuses on that, I'm an idiot.

01:57:42.700 --> 01:57:43.533
Plus five.

01:57:44.687 --> 01:57:46.303
It's just double dice damage?

01:57:46.303 --> 01:57:49.147
MATT: Double dice damage, then add your modifier.

01:57:49.147 --> 01:57:49.980
MARISHA: Woo!

01:57:49.980 --> 01:57:52.240
TALIESIN: That's 19 points of damage.

01:57:52.240 --> 01:57:53.273
MATT: To the general, nice.

01:57:53.273 --> 01:57:54.428
MARISHA: Nice.

01:57:54.428 --> 01:57:55.479
MATT: (explosion)

01:57:55.479 --> 01:57:56.888
He gets shot in the back
of the shoulderplate,

01:57:56.888 --> 01:57:57.966
you hear it ricochet and a little bit

01:57:57.966 --> 01:58:00.227
of blood begins to streak
off the back of his head.

01:58:00.227 --> 01:58:01.679
He looks over his shoulder
with an angry grunt,

01:58:01.679 --> 01:58:04.785
you can see now this dwarf,
who's still swelling in size.

01:58:04.785 --> 01:58:08.952
It looks, (growls), an
angry nostril flare.

01:58:10.245 --> 01:58:11.710
You, have your bow ready?

01:58:11.710 --> 01:58:14.541
LAURA: I wanna do Lightning Arrow on the guy

01:58:14.541 --> 01:58:15.894
attacking my brother.

01:58:15.894 --> 01:58:16.727
MATT: That guy there?

01:58:16.727 --> 01:58:17.560
LAURA: Yeah.

01:58:17.560 --> 01:58:21.353
MATT: Okay, go ahead and roll to attack.

01:58:21.353 --> 01:58:22.882
LAURA: Ugh, I don't think I hit.

01:58:22.882 --> 01:58:23.715
MATT: What'd you roll?

01:58:23.715 --> 01:58:24.735
LAURA: I had rolled a four.

01:58:24.735 --> 01:58:27.397
MATT: A four, you had a plus 11 to hit,

01:58:27.397 --> 01:58:29.417
it's going to be a 15,
unfortunately you miss.

01:58:29.417 --> 01:58:31.334
The arrow streaks past.

01:58:34.428 --> 01:58:36.699
Yeah, the arrow just ended up
striking the wall back here

01:58:36.699 --> 01:58:38.870
and (explosion) arcs
lightning throughout the wall,

01:58:38.870 --> 01:58:39.703
unfortunately does not--

01:58:39.703 --> 01:58:42.491
LAURA: I Hunter's Mark him anyway,
just for future stuff.

01:58:42.491 --> 01:58:43.324
MATT: You used your--

01:58:43.324 --> 01:58:44.171
LAURA: That was a bon--

01:58:44.171 --> 01:58:46.244
MATT: You used your bonus action
to cast Lightning Arrow.

01:58:46.244 --> 01:58:47.702
LAURA: Oh! So I get a regular attack now?

01:58:47.702 --> 01:58:48.801
MATT: Well, that was part of your regular attack,

01:58:48.801 --> 01:58:49.877
like your next arrow you fired.

01:58:49.877 --> 01:58:51.096
LAURA: I get it.

01:58:51.096 --> 01:58:52.244
(all laugh)

01:58:52.244 --> 01:58:53.563
TALIESIN: You're going off-book, this is cool.

01:58:53.563 --> 01:58:56.768
MATT: I think, let me double-check
real fast, just to be sure.

01:58:56.768 --> 01:58:58.750
Because I don't wanna screw
you out of a cool turn.

01:58:58.750 --> 01:59:00.000
LAURA: That is mine!

01:59:01.282 --> 01:59:02.462
MATT: Next time bring your sheet.

01:59:02.462 --> 01:59:03.295
LAURA: I'm sorry.

01:59:03.295 --> 01:59:04.128
MATT: That's okay.

01:59:04.128 --> 01:59:05.134
Yeah that's a bonus
action to cast lightning,

01:59:05.134 --> 01:59:06.265
into your next arrow you fire,

01:59:06.265 --> 01:59:07.647
however, you do have two attacks.

01:59:07.647 --> 01:59:08.772
So you can shoot a second time.

01:59:08.772 --> 01:59:11.964
It just isn't affected by Lightning Arrow.

01:59:11.964 --> 01:59:13.073
LAURA: I roll 14.

01:59:13.073 --> 01:59:14.387
MATT: That does hit, go ahead and roll
damage

01:59:14.387 --> 01:59:15.507
there's 1d10, plus--

01:59:15.507 --> 01:59:17.039
LAURA: I think it was 1d8, actually.

01:59:17.039 --> 01:59:20.453
MATT: Oh, for the longbow?
Okay, 1d8 plus five for your dex,

01:59:20.453 --> 01:59:22.329
and then plus two for the bow.

01:59:22.329 --> 01:59:23.848
Plus seven.

01:59:23.848 --> 01:59:24.754
LAURA: Ten.

01:59:24.754 --> 01:59:26.072
MATT: Ten damage, all right.

01:59:26.072 --> 01:59:28.727
So first arrow just
streaks off, hits the wall.

01:59:28.727 --> 01:59:29.749
As he's kind of staring at Percy,

01:59:29.749 --> 01:59:30.811
he looks towards you, and as he does,

01:59:30.811 --> 01:59:31.915
the second arrow

01:59:31.915 --> 01:59:33.408
sticks into the plate,
he kinda looks at it.

01:59:33.408 --> 01:59:34.445
(grunts)

01:59:34.445 --> 01:59:36.828
Just snaps it off in the armor.

01:59:36.828 --> 01:59:38.519
Grabbing his two-handed sword, or sorry,

01:59:38.519 --> 01:59:41.838
the war hammer in the other hand.

01:59:41.838 --> 01:59:44.029
Minis, it's confusing.

01:59:44.029 --> 01:59:47.007
All right, that ends your turn.

01:59:47.007 --> 01:59:50.177
Grog, the light that is
beaming from your helmet

01:59:50.177 --> 01:59:52.120
currently right now is
filling up the room,

01:59:52.120 --> 01:59:55.781
and it is extremely bright,
most of you guys can handle it.

01:59:55.781 --> 01:59:58.605
You see all the duergar at
the table like (groans),

01:59:58.605 --> 01:59:59.952
bunch of duergar come running in as well,

01:59:59.952 --> 02:00:01.614
as they run in, they're
having to shield their eyes,

02:00:01.614 --> 02:00:04.330
but it's actually physically hurting them

02:00:04.330 --> 02:00:05.424
to be in that room right now.

02:00:05.424 --> 02:00:06.692
They're like (groans).

02:00:06.692 --> 02:00:09.505
Keeping it at bay, this
one attempts to run in,

02:00:09.505 --> 02:00:12.381
this one's kind of making its way over.

02:00:12.381 --> 02:00:15.088
These guys here, this one's
gonna go ahead and run here,

02:00:15.088 --> 02:00:16.873
this one's gonna go
ahead and come to Grog.

02:00:16.873 --> 02:00:20.445
These two are gonna come up behind.

02:00:20.445 --> 02:00:22.086
SAM: Is that guy the general?

02:00:22.086 --> 02:00:23.504
MATT: That guy's the general, yes.

02:00:23.504 --> 02:00:25.312
This one's gonna come up behind to you.

02:00:25.312 --> 02:00:29.164
All right, they have
disadvantage on their attacks.

02:00:29.164 --> 02:00:30.100
ORION: Nice.

02:00:30.100 --> 02:00:31.523
MATT: Because of the light.

02:00:31.523 --> 02:00:33.799
(all cheer)

02:00:33.799 --> 02:00:35.908
TRAVIS: 'Cause I'm so bright.

02:00:35.908 --> 02:00:37.683
MATT: Attack against you.

02:00:37.683 --> 02:00:40.274
MARISHA: You're the brightest
tool in the shed today.

02:00:40.274 --> 02:00:42.357
MATT: That is a 17 versus AC.

02:00:43.932 --> 02:00:46.543
You just dodge out of the way.

02:00:46.543 --> 02:00:49.050
Next one, its
war pick against you, Grog.

02:00:49.050 --> 02:00:50.879
ASHLEY: Get skinny, get skinny.

02:00:50.879 --> 02:00:52.489
MATT: That is

02:00:52.489 --> 02:00:53.795
20 versus AC?

02:00:53.795 --> 02:00:54.628
TRAVIS: That hits.

02:00:54.628 --> 02:00:56.357
MATT: That hits, all right.

02:00:56.357 --> 02:00:58.940
You take eight points of damage

02:01:00.545 --> 02:01:02.604
as it slams you with its
war pick in the chest,

02:01:02.604 --> 02:01:03.802
you can feel it kind of gets about

02:01:03.802 --> 02:01:05.017
a half an inch of depth into it,

02:01:05.017 --> 02:01:06.005
but you just kind of shrug it off,

02:01:06.005 --> 02:01:08.130
and flex your muscles and it
pops it out of your torso.

02:01:08.130 --> 02:01:09.297
TRAVIS: That's cute.

02:01:10.427 --> 02:01:12.260
MATT: The two against you.

02:01:15.179 --> 02:01:17.346
That'll be a 19 versus AC.

02:01:18.760 --> 02:01:20.261
LAURA: Oh, yeah, that hits for sure.

02:01:20.261 --> 02:01:22.518
MATT: And a 17 versus AC.

02:01:22.518 --> 02:01:23.351
LAURA: That--

02:01:24.206 --> 02:01:25.039
hits.

02:01:25.039 --> 02:01:26.345
MATT: All right, so you take two hits.

02:01:26.345 --> 02:01:27.928
That's 11 damage.

02:01:29.217 --> 02:01:32.817
And 13 damage as both of them
start whaling you from behind

02:01:32.817 --> 02:01:33.872
with war picks.

02:01:33.872 --> 02:01:35.108
LIAM: Vex'ahlia!

02:01:35.953 --> 02:01:36.871
I yell.

02:01:36.871 --> 02:01:38.038
LAURA: 13 and what?

02:01:39.468 --> 02:01:40.754
MATT: All right.

02:01:40.754 --> 02:01:43.235
Next up is the one that's attacking you.

02:01:43.235 --> 02:01:44.068
SAM: Scanlan.

02:01:44.068 --> 02:01:46.910
MATT: Scanlan, that's going to
be, at a disadvantage,

02:01:46.910 --> 02:01:48.853
a 15 versus armor class.

02:01:48.853 --> 02:01:49.686
SAM: 14.

02:01:49.686 --> 02:01:51.756
MATT: 14? That still strikes you.

02:01:51.756 --> 02:01:54.085
You take eight points of
damage from the war pick.

02:01:54.085 --> 02:01:55.845
Slamming you over the shoulder.

02:01:55.845 --> 02:01:58.077
SAM: (yells out) Ah, I'm so awesome, Pike!

02:01:58.077 --> 02:02:00.327
(all laugh)

02:02:02.016 --> 02:02:04.319
MATT: That ends their go, Tiberius, you're up.

02:02:04.319 --> 02:02:05.471
ORION: I'm still on the roof, right?

02:02:05.471 --> 02:02:06.730
MATT: You're still on the roof, yes.

02:02:06.730 --> 02:02:09.073
ORION: What can I see, like if I go down,

02:02:09.073 --> 02:02:10.421
what can I see?

02:02:10.421 --> 02:02:11.442
MATT: You look through the hole,

02:02:11.442 --> 02:02:13.069
and you can see pretty much
the entire battlefield.

02:02:13.069 --> 02:02:14.740
You're just up here
looking down through it.

02:02:14.740 --> 02:02:16.210
ORION: Oh, wonderful.

02:02:16.210 --> 02:02:17.565
MATT: You're currently the
only one still up there.

02:02:17.565 --> 02:02:20.422
ORION: Yes, I think I'll stay right
here, thank you very much.

02:02:20.422 --> 02:02:23.126
And how tall is the roof?

02:02:23.126 --> 02:02:24.376
How high is it?

02:02:25.691 --> 02:02:26.524
15 feet?

02:02:26.524 --> 02:02:29.285
MATT: It's about 25 feet up?

02:02:29.285 --> 02:02:31.702
ORION: Okay, wonderful, wonderful.

02:02:33.021 --> 02:02:35.164
So, let me see here.

02:02:35.164 --> 02:02:36.331
This is fun.

02:02:37.621 --> 02:02:40.141
MATT: You are technically, because I can do it.

02:02:40.141 --> 02:02:41.793
TALIESIN: Gonna use one of the
little lifties, aren't you?

02:02:41.793 --> 02:02:42.626
MATT: I am.

02:02:43.493 --> 02:02:44.359
MARISHA: Finally.

02:02:44.359 --> 02:02:45.779
LIAM: Bring the fire, Tiberus.

02:02:45.779 --> 02:02:46.612
SAM: Oh.

02:02:50.644 --> 02:02:51.477
Toys.

02:02:51.477 --> 02:02:53.685
MARISHA: Now he's getting out toys.

02:02:53.685 --> 02:02:54.518
TALIESIN: Aw yeah.

02:02:54.518 --> 02:02:57.101
SAM: Come on, do something.

02:02:57.101 --> 02:02:58.145
ORION: I'm waiting for him to do something,

02:02:58.145 --> 02:02:58.989
'cause it's so cool.

02:02:58.989 --> 02:03:00.632
MARISHA: I got him this for
Christmas two years ago,

02:03:00.632 --> 02:03:01.580
and he's finally using it.

02:03:01.580 --> 02:03:02.413
MATT: You are up here right now.

02:03:05.130 --> 02:03:05.963
ORION: Awesome.

02:03:05.963 --> 02:03:06.894
TRAVIS: Three-dimensional fighting.

02:03:06.894 --> 02:03:08.625
LIAM: Toys, toys.

02:03:08.625 --> 02:03:10.129
MATT: Is that visible?

02:03:10.129 --> 02:03:11.629
TALIESIN: Yeah.

02:03:12.960 --> 02:03:14.210
Sweet D&amp;amp;D rave.

02:03:15.992 --> 02:03:17.364
ORION: Okay.

02:03:17.364 --> 02:03:18.614
I'm going to--

02:03:19.732 --> 02:03:22.504
I see the two guards behind Vex, right?

02:03:22.504 --> 02:03:23.440
Is that what's going on?

02:03:23.440 --> 02:03:24.273
MATT: Yep, right there.

02:03:24.273 --> 02:03:26.399
ORION: And then the one duergar in front of Grog?

02:03:26.399 --> 02:03:27.232
Is that what's going on, too?

02:03:27.232 --> 02:03:28.065
MATT: Yep, right there.

02:03:28.065 --> 02:03:30.288
Great, I will cast

02:03:30.288 --> 02:03:32.399
Grand Columns

02:03:32.399 --> 02:03:35.142
under all three of those
dudes, and pin 'em.

02:03:35.142 --> 02:03:38.057
Right up against the roof.

02:03:38.057 --> 02:03:39.162
With my columns.

02:03:39.162 --> 02:03:39.995
LIAM: Clever girl.

02:03:39.995 --> 02:03:40.828
MATT: The?

02:03:41.748 --> 02:03:43.228
ORION: Pillars, yes.

02:03:43.228 --> 02:03:44.889
MATT: But those pillars only go 15 feet up.

02:03:44.889 --> 02:03:47.264
ORION: No, they go up to 25.

02:03:47.264 --> 02:03:48.194
MATT: 25? Oh nice.

02:03:48.194 --> 02:03:49.027
ORION: Yeah.

02:03:49.027 --> 02:03:49.938
MATT: Okay.

02:03:49.938 --> 02:03:52.044
ORION: That's why I always ask that question.

02:03:53.393 --> 02:03:57.077
It does 66 bludgeoning
damage when it's pinned.

02:03:57.077 --> 02:03:57.957
ASHLEY: Bye bye.

02:03:57.957 --> 02:04:00.718
SAM: If they don't make their save.

02:04:00.718 --> 02:04:02.069
MATT: All right, so.

02:04:02.069 --> 02:04:04.948
Go ahead and what is your DC on that?

02:04:04.948 --> 02:04:05.959
Your spell DC?

02:04:05.959 --> 02:04:06.792
ORION: 17.

02:04:06.792 --> 02:04:07.959
MATT: 17, all right.

02:04:14.250 --> 02:04:16.536
All right, the heartiness
of the duergar resilience

02:04:16.536 --> 02:04:19.365
gives them advantage on
saves against spells.

02:04:19.365 --> 02:04:21.639
They all make their saves.

02:04:21.639 --> 02:04:22.472
SAM: What?

02:04:23.357 --> 02:04:26.085
MATT: But they are still up
on these platforms now,

02:04:26.085 --> 02:04:27.984
raised above.

02:04:27.984 --> 02:04:29.067
So what is--

02:04:31.193 --> 02:04:33.157
Does it do any damage if
they make their saves?

02:04:33.157 --> 02:04:35.740
ORION: (reading)

02:04:37.157 --> 02:04:38.741
SAM: Come on iPhone, come on iphone!

02:04:39.964 --> 02:04:41.291
MARISHA: You're supposed to know everything!

02:04:41.291 --> 02:04:42.458
SAM: iPhone five!

02:04:43.894 --> 02:04:44.977
This is the Fifth Edition.

02:04:44.977 --> 02:04:45.907
ORION: Why doesn't it say?

02:04:45.907 --> 02:04:47.436
I guess it doesn't.

02:04:47.436 --> 02:04:48.686
It doesn't say.

02:04:49.936 --> 02:04:51.185
MATT: So they are currently--

02:04:51.185 --> 02:04:52.380
SAM: What is this madness?

02:04:52.380 --> 02:04:53.880
TALIESIN: Oh, you're crazy.

02:04:55.375 --> 02:04:57.292
ORION: Oh, wait a minute, no.

02:04:58.126 --> 02:04:59.285
You make this call.

02:04:59.285 --> 02:05:01.204
If a pillar is prevented
from reaching its full height

02:05:01.204 --> 02:05:02.636
because of a ceiling or other obstacle,

02:05:02.636 --> 02:05:04.697
a creature on the pillar
takes 66 bludgeoning damage

02:05:04.697 --> 02:05:07.029
and is restrained, pinched
between the pillar and obstacle.

02:05:07.029 --> 02:05:08.802
The restrained creature can use an action

02:05:08.802 --> 02:05:10.299
to make a strength or dexterity check

02:05:10.299 --> 02:05:12.475
against the spell save DC. On a success they are

02:05:12.475 --> 02:05:14.523
no longer restrained, and must
either move off the pole,

02:05:14.523 --> 02:05:15.661
or fall off of it.

02:05:15.661 --> 02:05:17.393
So they still, it still happens,

02:05:17.393 --> 02:05:19.053
but they're not pinned by it.

02:05:19.053 --> 02:05:19.886
Got you, okay.

02:05:19.886 --> 02:05:21.396
So go ahead and roll
damage for all of them.

02:05:21.396 --> 02:05:22.284
MARISHA: Woo!

02:05:22.284 --> 02:05:23.275
MATT: Good to know.

02:05:23.275 --> 02:05:24.898
(sings) New spells that just got released.

02:05:24.898 --> 02:05:27.295
LIAM: There's magic in the dwarves.

02:05:27.295 --> 02:05:28.609
SAM: Magic in them.

02:05:28.609 --> 02:05:30.477
LIAM: The duergar.

02:05:30.477 --> 02:05:33.021
MARISHA: ♫ A whole new spell

02:05:33.021 --> 02:05:36.499
TALIESIN: ♫ A fantastic way to die

02:05:36.499 --> 02:05:38.702
MARISHA: ♫ No one can tell us no

02:05:38.702 --> 02:05:39.535
ORION: 27 damage.

02:05:39.535 --> 02:05:41.207
MARISHA: ♫ Except for Matt

02:05:41.207 --> 02:05:43.993
(all laugh)

02:05:43.993 --> 02:05:47.239
MATT: All three of the duergar are crushed.

02:05:47.239 --> 02:05:48.323
SAM: To death?

02:05:48.323 --> 02:05:49.226
MATT: Against the ceiling.

02:05:49.226 --> 02:05:50.210
ORION: I did 27 damage to each one.

02:05:50.210 --> 02:05:51.864
TRAVIS: Nice!

02:05:51.864 --> 02:05:54.062
MATT: Splat, splat, splat, they're all slammed
into the ceiling,

02:05:54.062 --> 02:05:57.062
you can see limp dwarf arms and legs

02:05:57.908 --> 02:05:59.624
now dangling out of the stone pillars

02:05:59.624 --> 02:06:01.594
that are now permanently
embedding them into the ceiling.

02:06:01.594 --> 02:06:02.439
LIAM: Yeah, son.

02:06:02.439 --> 02:06:03.400
SAM: Crazy room!

02:06:03.400 --> 02:06:05.361
ORION: I go like this, hah!

02:06:05.361 --> 02:06:08.028
I use two of my sorcerer points,

02:06:09.088 --> 02:06:10.521
and I cast Quicken Spell,

02:06:10.521 --> 02:06:13.827
and I look at the general, and I--

02:06:13.827 --> 02:06:16.007
Because of my books I've
been tampering with,

02:06:16.007 --> 02:06:18.174
I cast Blight on his eyes.

02:06:19.686 --> 02:06:20.519
Okay.

02:06:20.519 --> 02:06:22.184
'Cause I wanna.

02:06:22.184 --> 02:06:23.986
(all laugh)

02:06:23.986 --> 02:06:25.593
MATT: What's the-- the DC is 17, you said?

02:06:25.593 --> 02:06:27.179
ORION: Yes.

02:06:27.179 --> 02:06:28.589
MATT: All right, natural 20.

02:06:28.589 --> 02:06:29.422
So he makes his save.

02:06:29.422 --> 02:06:31.735
(all groan)

02:06:31.735 --> 02:06:34.203
ORION: He takes 8d8 damage, and if he saves,

02:06:34.203 --> 02:06:35.606
he takes half the damage.

02:06:35.606 --> 02:06:36.439
MATT: Okay.

02:06:38.399 --> 02:06:39.232
ORION: 10, 15.

02:06:41.366 --> 02:06:42.992
LIAM: They were all eights, right?

02:06:42.992 --> 02:06:44.716
MARISHA: Well, he does all of them 
and then divides.

02:06:44.716 --> 02:06:45.549
SAM: But you said half.

02:06:45.549 --> 02:06:46.976
MARISHA: He rolls all of them and then divides.

02:06:46.976 --> 02:06:48.149
SAM: I see.

02:06:48.149 --> 02:06:50.964
ORION: 15 plus, what is that, ten, 14.

02:06:50.964 --> 02:06:51.830
MARISHA: Your first one was--

02:06:51.830 --> 02:06:52.663
ORION: 29?

02:06:54.035 --> 02:06:57.651
MATT: So we'll say a solid 14 points of damage.

02:06:57.651 --> 02:06:58.984
All right, gotcha.

02:07:00.271 --> 02:07:03.310
No other effect, just the
damage from Blight, right?

02:07:03.310 --> 02:07:05.653
ORION: Yeah, because he made his save.

02:07:05.653 --> 02:07:06.559
MATT: All right, Scanlan, you're up.

02:07:06.559 --> 02:07:07.979
SAM: Oh, okay.

02:07:07.979 --> 02:07:10.973
I'm going to, (groans).

02:07:10.973 --> 02:07:13.264
God there's so few people to kill now.

02:07:13.264 --> 02:07:14.910
(all laugh)

02:07:14.910 --> 02:07:16.829
SAM: You did it all, is it
just us and the general?

02:07:16.829 --> 02:07:18.126
LAURA: Wait, that guy behind you though.

02:07:18.126 --> 02:07:19.132
MATT: Just you guys, the general.

02:07:19.132 --> 02:07:21.349
There's a guy right behind you.

02:07:21.349 --> 02:07:22.622
Those guys got slammed.

02:07:25.204 --> 02:07:27.287
SAM: Okay, I'm gonna cast

02:07:30.209 --> 02:07:32.589
Dominate Person on the general.

02:07:32.589 --> 02:07:34.423
TRAIVS: (laughs) What does that do?

02:07:34.423 --> 02:07:35.821
ORION: Oh shit.

02:07:35.821 --> 02:07:36.654
TALIESIN: No.

02:07:36.654 --> 02:07:38.386
LIAM: He's a power top.

02:07:38.386 --> 02:07:39.867
MATT: With advantage, he
rolled a one and a two,

02:07:39.867 --> 02:07:40.700
on the saving throw.

02:07:40.700 --> 02:07:42.459
(all cheer)

02:07:42.459 --> 02:07:44.271
MATT: That's ridiculous, okay.

02:07:44.271 --> 02:07:45.689
SAM: I'm going to

02:07:45.689 --> 02:07:47.771
Dominate him and inform him,

02:07:47.771 --> 02:07:50.015
I can give him a command, right?

02:07:50.015 --> 02:07:50.848
Yes.

02:07:50.848 --> 02:07:51.681
ORION: You can make him do whatever.

02:07:51.681 --> 02:07:53.687
SAM: I'm going to tell him to stand down,

02:07:53.687 --> 02:07:57.104
and tell all of his allies to stand down.

02:07:58.233 --> 02:07:59.066
MATT: All right.

02:08:01.653 --> 02:08:03.626
He turns around.

02:08:03.626 --> 02:08:06.524
Gives you a look, a strange look, he goes.

02:08:06.524 --> 02:08:09.524
"Men, all of you, drop your weapons!

02:08:10.392 --> 02:08:11.225
"Now.

02:08:12.078 --> 02:08:16.258
"We are surrendering to
our new infiltrators."

02:08:16.258 --> 02:08:19.508
He throws his war hammer to the ground.

02:08:21.085 --> 02:08:23.402
The rest of them all kind of look around.

02:08:23.402 --> 02:08:26.077
Go ahead and, I'm gonna have
you make intimidation check

02:08:26.077 --> 02:08:27.000
on his behalf.

02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:28.407
SAM: Okay, on his behalf?

02:08:28.407 --> 02:08:29.240
MATT: Yes.

02:08:31.002 --> 02:08:32.293
SAM: Do I add mine?

02:08:32.293 --> 02:08:35.243
MATT: No, I'm just considering
that, so you rolled 11?

02:08:35.243 --> 02:08:36.076
SAM: 11.

02:08:39.831 --> 02:08:41.998
(sings along with the music)

02:08:43.392 --> 02:08:45.242
MATT: The three other duergar look confused,

02:08:45.242 --> 02:08:46.496
look at the dead mind flayer,

02:08:46.496 --> 02:08:47.910
look at their general
telling them to surrender,

02:08:47.910 --> 02:08:50.114
and they all kinda throw
their weapons to the ground,

02:08:50.114 --> 02:08:52.198
and stand there with
their arms to the side,

02:08:52.198 --> 02:08:55.751
kind of waiting for
what's gonna happen next.

02:08:55.751 --> 02:09:00.250
As you finish that,
Clarota slowly drifts down.

02:09:00.250 --> 02:09:02.234
SAM: Oh yeah, Clarota, thanks
for all the fucking help.

02:09:02.234 --> 02:09:04.484
(all laugh)

02:09:06.010 --> 02:09:06.843
LAURA: Oh no.

02:09:06.843 --> 02:09:08.593
This is gonna be bad.

02:09:10.513 --> 02:09:12.256
MATT: Clarota just kinda looks around.

02:09:12.256 --> 02:09:15.366
Says, you hear this voice in your mind go,

02:09:15.366 --> 02:09:18.199
"I had my doubts, but, well done."

02:09:21.077 --> 02:09:22.684
ORION: Thank you.

02:09:22.684 --> 02:09:23.970
MATT: So.

02:09:23.970 --> 02:09:25.857
That ends that turn.

02:09:25.857 --> 02:09:27.994
Scanlan, do you want to move at all?

02:09:27.994 --> 02:09:29.924
Are you going to stay where you are?

02:09:29.924 --> 02:09:31.370
SAM: I'm gonna stay where, well,

02:09:31.370 --> 02:09:32.605
I'm gonna move just a couple feet

02:09:32.605 --> 02:09:33.871
away from the guy right behind me,

02:09:33.871 --> 02:09:36.720
and I'm going to, as my bonus action,

02:09:36.720 --> 02:09:39.841
might as well give Grog some dice.

02:09:39.841 --> 02:09:41.077
And also just tell everyone,

02:09:41.077 --> 02:09:42.629
remember, let's not kill the general,

02:09:42.629 --> 02:09:44.217
we need him for information.

02:09:44.217 --> 02:09:45.578
LIAM: Probably if anyone tries to hit him,

02:09:45.578 --> 02:09:47.661
he'll snap out of it, so.

02:09:50.351 --> 02:09:51.351
SAM: That's it.

02:09:53.410 --> 02:09:56.660
I also take a little poo in my pants.

02:09:57.524 --> 02:09:58.607
TALIESIN: Small kilo.

02:10:02.022 --> 02:10:04.174
SAM: This is still--

02:10:04.174 --> 02:10:06.279
A battle? Even though.

02:10:06.279 --> 02:10:07.112
No combatants?

02:10:07.112 --> 02:10:09.378
MATT: I mean, if you guys are deciding
not to fight anymore,

02:10:09.378 --> 02:10:11.383
what's your plan?

02:10:11.383 --> 02:10:12.216
MARISHA: I--

02:10:13.281 --> 02:10:17.097
Come on down and I say, good work guys.

02:10:17.097 --> 02:10:20.142
That was cool, that was great.

02:10:20.142 --> 02:10:21.759
SAM: He's under my spell.

02:10:21.759 --> 02:10:22.988
LAURA: Perhaps we should tie him up.

02:10:22.988 --> 02:10:24.363
MARISHA: That's what I was gonna say,

02:10:24.363 --> 02:10:28.759
I cast Grasping Vine
and I just take a vine

02:10:28.759 --> 02:10:32.180
and I tie his hands behind his back.

02:10:32.180 --> 02:10:33.972
And kind of grapple him.

02:10:33.972 --> 02:10:35.194
SAM: So that'll break the spell.

02:10:35.194 --> 02:10:37.904
MARISHA: Well no, I'm not damaging him, I'm just--

02:10:37.904 --> 02:10:38.805
LIAM: Hugging him.

02:10:38.805 --> 02:10:39.638
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:10:39.638 --> 02:10:41.013
LAURA: Hugging him with vines.

02:10:41.013 --> 02:10:42.763
TALIESIN: Vine hugs.

02:10:46.001 --> 02:10:50.168
MATT: As this is happening, you
guys feel a familiar tremble.

02:10:51.064 --> 02:10:51.897
SAM: Oh no.

02:10:53.243 --> 02:10:54.456
Be quiet.

02:10:54.456 --> 02:10:56.020
MATT: In the ground.

02:10:56.020 --> 02:10:58.020
LIAM: DM is out of his mind.

02:10:59.703 --> 02:11:00.857
MATT: Everyone make a stealth check.

02:11:00.857 --> 02:11:01.690
(all laugh)

02:11:01.690 --> 02:11:03.231
MARISHA: Damn it.

02:11:03.231 --> 02:11:05.374
ORION: Oh, that's a 20.

02:11:05.374 --> 02:11:06.624
SAM: That is a 20.

02:11:07.509 --> 02:11:09.723
MARISHA: (whimpers)

02:11:09.723 --> 02:11:12.979
This is the second time I
rolled a one on my stealth check.

02:11:12.979 --> 02:11:14.455
TALIESIN: Wow.

02:11:14.455 --> 02:11:15.992
MARISHA: I'm not stealthy today.

02:11:15.992 --> 02:11:16.825
ASHLEY: 17.
LIAM: 18.

02:11:16.825 --> 02:11:17.658
LAURA: 19.

02:11:17.658 --> 02:11:18.722
TRAVIS: 14.

02:11:18.722 --> 02:11:20.352
TALIESIN: 23.

02:11:20.352 --> 02:11:21.337
LIAM: Pretty good overall.

02:11:21.337 --> 02:11:22.241
ORION: Two.

02:11:22.241 --> 02:11:23.757
SAM: 22.

02:11:23.757 --> 02:11:24.590
MATT: All right.

02:11:30.124 --> 02:11:33.683
There is the rumble,
gets louder and louder,

02:11:33.683 --> 02:11:38.509
and you can see the duergar
looking around nervously.

02:11:38.509 --> 02:11:41.842
The rumbling kind of fades for a second.

02:11:43.169 --> 02:11:44.912
And with a cacophonous cracking sound,

02:11:44.912 --> 02:11:47.434
the stone floor beneath
you

02:11:47.434 --> 02:11:48.435
splits open.

02:11:48.435 --> 02:11:49.268
SAM: No!

02:11:50.959 --> 02:11:51.850
MATT: Right here.

02:11:51.850 --> 02:11:53.005
LIAM: (groans)

02:11:53.005 --> 02:11:54.197
MATT: Percy, make an acrobatics check

02:11:54.197 --> 02:11:57.213
and try to avoid whatever
is coming through.

02:11:57.213 --> 02:11:59.320
SAM: Whatever? It's a dragon!

02:11:59.320 --> 02:12:00.504
TALIESIN: 18.
LIAM: It's a worm.

02:12:00.504 --> 02:12:02.559
MATT: All right, you manage to
just pull out of the way.

02:12:02.559 --> 02:12:04.097
As a large--

02:12:04.097 --> 02:12:06.118
LAURA: What the fuck is that?

02:12:06.118 --> 02:12:07.253
MARISHA: : What is that?

02:12:07.253 --> 02:12:09.890
MATT: A large armored four-legged creature

02:12:09.890 --> 02:12:12.764
comes bursting out of
the ground around you.

02:12:12.764 --> 02:12:14.679
ORION: Oh great, it's a rock butthole.

02:12:14.679 --> 02:12:17.230
(all laugh)

02:12:17.230 --> 02:12:21.448
MATT: Lets out this horrible
screeching growl,

02:12:21.448 --> 02:12:23.832
has this kind of hungry look in its eyes.

02:12:23.832 --> 02:12:25.624
MARISHA: Can I reactionary real quick,

02:12:25.624 --> 02:12:28.921
take my Grasping Vine and just lift him

02:12:28.921 --> 02:12:30.009
and kind of put him in the corner

02:12:30.009 --> 02:12:32.116
to keep the general safe?

02:12:32.116 --> 02:12:34.365
MATT: Unfortunately, no.

02:12:34.365 --> 02:12:35.721
ORION: Is he rooted?

02:12:35.721 --> 02:12:37.451
MATT: He is currently--

02:12:37.451 --> 02:12:39.689
Is considered grappled.

02:12:39.689 --> 02:12:41.539
LIAM: I have a question.

02:12:41.539 --> 02:12:42.839
MARISHA: I was just trying to keep him safe.

02:12:42.839 --> 02:12:43.971
LIAM: Can we take a potty break before?

02:12:43.971 --> 02:12:44.861
SAM: A potty break?

02:12:44.861 --> 02:12:45.943
No breaks tonight!

02:12:45.943 --> 02:12:46.776
LIAM: No breaks?

02:12:46.776 --> 02:12:47.776
MARISHA: No breaks.

02:12:48.753 --> 02:12:50.726
MATT: We're pushing through.

02:12:50.726 --> 02:12:51.559
You need a bottle.

02:12:51.559 --> 02:12:53.476
MARISHA: Exercise your kegels.

02:12:55.059 --> 02:12:56.481
MATT: If you really need to go, you can.

02:12:56.481 --> 02:12:58.116
When it's not your turn.

02:12:58.116 --> 02:12:58.979
LIAM: No, I'm fine.

02:12:58.979 --> 02:13:01.859
SAM: Just pee on Ashley, it's okay.

02:13:01.859 --> 02:13:04.776
CREW: Suck it up, man.

02:13:04.776 --> 02:13:06.372
MATT: As this entity comes burrowing up

02:13:06.372 --> 02:13:08.789
from underneath the ground,

02:13:10.668 --> 02:13:13.413
it immediately makes a

02:13:13.413 --> 02:13:14.830
strike against--

02:13:21.259 --> 02:13:22.804
SAM: Guys, this is so exciting.

02:13:22.804 --> 02:13:24.646
And Laura has no idea what's going on.

02:13:24.646 --> 02:13:26.887
LAURA: No clue, good times.

02:13:26.887 --> 02:13:29.027
MATT: This is gonna be a bite
attack against you, Percy.

02:13:29.027 --> 02:13:32.701
That is, all right, 24 versus armor class.

02:13:32.701 --> 02:13:34.284
TRAVIS: Shit, bite is at 24.

02:13:35.185 --> 02:13:36.106
TALIESIN: Yeah, that--

02:13:36.106 --> 02:13:36.939
That hits.

02:13:37.904 --> 02:13:40.938
MATT: As you reactively attempt
to move out of the way,

02:13:40.938 --> 02:13:43.452
this creature comes
tearing out of the ground.

02:13:43.452 --> 02:13:46.013
Gets its bearings, rears back,

02:13:46.013 --> 02:13:48.672
and this giant, toothy
maw comes clamping down

02:13:48.672 --> 02:13:50.783
onto your entire torso.

02:13:50.783 --> 02:13:52.521
You suffer 36 points of piercing damage.

02:13:52.521 --> 02:13:53.401
SAM: Oh!

02:13:53.401 --> 02:13:54.832
TALIESIN: The fuck?

02:13:54.832 --> 02:13:55.733
MARISHA: 36?

02:13:55.733 --> 02:13:58.316
MATT: 36 points of piercing damage.

02:14:03.161 --> 02:14:05.578
That's going to end its turn.

02:14:06.506 --> 02:14:07.509
MARISHA: Shit.

02:14:07.509 --> 02:14:09.310
MATT: Pike, you're up.

02:14:09.310 --> 02:14:10.703
ASHLEY: Okay, well.

02:14:10.703 --> 02:14:11.703
TALIESIN: That hurt.

02:14:12.641 --> 02:14:14.098
ASHLEY: I'm still prone?

02:14:14.098 --> 02:14:14.931
MATT: You are prone,

02:14:14.931 --> 02:14:16.031
you can use your movement to get back up.

02:14:16.031 --> 02:14:19.339
ASHLEY: Okay, I use my movement to get back up.

02:14:19.339 --> 02:14:21.592
Do I also get an attack for doing that?

02:14:21.592 --> 02:14:23.239
MATT: You still have your action,
and your bonus action,

02:14:23.239 --> 02:14:24.104
it's just your move.

02:14:24.104 --> 02:14:25.717
ASHLEY: Okay.

02:14:25.717 --> 02:14:29.884
I will use Guiding Bolt, and
I'm gonna shoot that thing.

02:14:31.142 --> 02:14:35.090
MATT: All right, go ahead and roll for the attack.

02:14:35.090 --> 02:14:36.580
SAM: That's my girlfriend.
TRAVIS: Come on, Pike.

02:14:36.580 --> 02:14:37.630
MARISHA: Does this guy appear to be messed up

02:14:37.630 --> 02:14:39.425
by the Daylight at all?

02:14:39.425 --> 02:14:40.766
ASHLEY: Okay.

02:14:40.766 --> 02:14:42.006
Do I add anything?

02:14:42.006 --> 02:14:44.123
MATT: You add your spell attack modifier,

02:14:44.123 --> 02:14:46.388
it's on your spell sheet.

02:14:46.388 --> 02:14:47.813
So the top of your spell sheet.

02:14:47.813 --> 02:14:49.472
ASHLEY: Sorry guys.

02:14:49.472 --> 02:14:51.055
Oh sweet, okay, so.

02:14:54.340 --> 02:14:55.716
That would be 25.

02:14:55.716 --> 02:14:57.023
MATT: That definitely hits.

02:14:57.023 --> 02:14:59.119
So, Guiding Bolt, what does that do?

02:14:59.119 --> 02:15:02.286
ASHLEY: So I roll, where'd it go, I roll 4d6.

02:15:04.231 --> 02:15:05.079
I roll 4d6.

02:15:05.079 --> 02:15:07.329
MATT: 4d6, go ahead and do that.

02:15:10.807 --> 02:15:11.640
ASHLEY: Yes.

02:15:14.691 --> 02:15:15.957
16.

02:15:15.957 --> 02:15:17.860
MATT: 16, all right.

02:15:17.860 --> 02:15:21.488
So you reach back,
clutching your holy symbol.

02:15:21.488 --> 02:15:22.882
You get back off the ground,

02:15:22.882 --> 02:15:25.756
release your hand as this
suddenly flaring blast

02:15:25.756 --> 02:15:27.453
of divine energy comes cascading

02:15:27.453 --> 02:15:28.806
out of the front of your palm,

02:15:28.806 --> 02:15:30.300
blasting into the side of the face,

02:15:30.300 --> 02:15:32.426
nearly searing one of
the eyes of the creature.

02:15:32.426 --> 02:15:34.687
It rears back, brings
one leg up instinctually,

02:15:34.687 --> 02:15:37.542
(growls) slams the ground in the process--

02:15:37.542 --> 02:15:38.674
How you doing?

02:15:38.674 --> 02:15:40.240
That's disadvantage to your next attack.

02:15:40.240 --> 02:15:41.073
LIAM: Aw!

02:15:44.052 --> 02:15:46.402
ASHLEY: Wait, what are you at?

02:15:46.402 --> 02:15:47.402
TALIESIN: I'm at 38.

02:15:49.835 --> 02:15:51.508
MATT: It lands, puts its foot
back on the ground,

02:15:51.508 --> 02:15:54.113
and kinda gears its attention towards you.

02:15:54.113 --> 02:15:55.128
It's angling around the room

02:15:55.128 --> 02:15:57.940
for what should be its next meal.

02:15:57.940 --> 02:15:59.837
Anything else you wanna do?

02:15:59.837 --> 02:16:02.479
ASHLEY: Can I give him a healing potion?

02:16:02.479 --> 02:16:03.675
Can I heal him?

02:16:03.675 --> 02:16:04.654
MATT: He's too far away.

02:16:04.654 --> 02:16:05.487
You could use your bonus action

02:16:05.487 --> 02:16:06.571
if you wanna use Healing Word.

02:16:06.571 --> 02:16:07.512
ASHLEY: Okay, I'll use Healing Word.

02:16:07.512 --> 02:16:09.654
MATT: Okay, so go ahead and roll that for him.

02:16:09.654 --> 02:16:13.260
While you're doing that, brings us--

02:16:13.260 --> 02:16:16.463
So Clarota now gets its action.

02:16:16.463 --> 02:16:17.924
MARISHA: Yeah, Clarota!

02:16:17.924 --> 02:16:20.457
MATT: Clarota now looks wide-eyed, seeing this happen.

02:16:20.457 --> 02:16:23.957
You hear a slight voice in
the back of your head go,

02:16:23.957 --> 02:16:25.943
"This is complicating."

02:16:25.943 --> 02:16:27.357
As it rears back,

02:16:27.357 --> 02:16:29.795
you hear the slight
echoing, screeching sound,

02:16:29.795 --> 02:16:32.647
that just manages to skirt the outside

02:16:32.647 --> 02:16:34.202
of your mental capacity.

02:16:34.202 --> 02:16:35.459
You feel like if you were any closer,

02:16:35.459 --> 02:16:36.584
or if it was directed towards you,

02:16:36.584 --> 02:16:38.575
it would be a horrible
ringing pain in your head.

02:16:38.575 --> 02:16:40.329
You're just peripheral to it.

02:16:40.329 --> 02:16:42.475
It makes its attack.

02:16:42.475 --> 02:16:44.601
Unfortunately, the exterior, the bulette,

02:16:44.601 --> 02:16:46.173
and/or its mind shielding is too strong,

02:16:46.173 --> 02:16:48.114
it seems to have no
effect on the creature.

02:16:48.114 --> 02:16:49.162
SAM: Damn it!

02:16:49.162 --> 02:16:51.170
Clarota, worthless!

02:16:51.170 --> 02:16:53.503
MATT: A bulette, is the entity.

02:16:56.061 --> 02:16:58.947
That ends its turn,
top of the round, Vax.

02:16:58.947 --> 02:17:01.530
LIAM: Okay, I think, where's the laser?

02:17:02.770 --> 02:17:03.905
Here it is.

02:17:03.905 --> 02:17:06.250
It looks like I have
just enough squares to go

02:17:06.250 --> 02:17:07.416
one two three.

02:17:10.032 --> 02:17:10.912
Who's this right here?

02:17:10.912 --> 02:17:12.208
MATT: That's a duergar.

02:17:12.208 --> 02:17:13.772
Weapon on the ground, not armed right now.

02:17:13.772 --> 02:17:15.652
LIAM: Can I get to here on a turn?

02:17:15.652 --> 02:17:17.077
I can't tell.

02:17:17.077 --> 02:17:18.243
MATT: What's your movement?

02:17:18.243 --> 02:17:20.075
LIAM: It's 30 feet.

02:17:21.708 --> 02:17:24.614
I'll use my bonus action to
click my haste boots together.

02:17:24.614 --> 02:17:27.331
MATT: Okay, then you can definitely do that.

02:17:27.331 --> 02:17:30.191
LIAM: Okay, and since Percy
is right up against it,

02:17:30.191 --> 02:17:32.911
I'm able to deal Sneak Attack damage,

02:17:32.911 --> 02:17:34.869
because there's another one of its foes.

02:17:34.869 --> 02:17:36.054
MATT: Exactly, yes.

02:17:36.054 --> 02:17:37.272
You don't get an advantage on the attack,

02:17:37.272 --> 02:17:38.834
but if you attack, you do it.

02:17:38.834 --> 02:17:41.824
LIAM: So I'm gonna try to strike
him in his underbelly.

02:17:41.824 --> 02:17:42.656
MATT: All right.

02:17:43.618 --> 02:17:45.749
Even the underbelly
itself is heavily armored,

02:17:45.749 --> 02:17:47.585
you have to kind of gauge
quickly where the plate is.

02:17:47.585 --> 02:17:48.466
LIAM: 20.

02:17:48.466 --> 02:17:49.321
MATT: 20?

02:17:49.321 --> 02:17:50.443
20 hits.

02:17:50.443 --> 02:17:52.543
MATT: Go ahead and roll with
your Sneak Attack damage.

02:17:52.543 --> 02:17:53.555
MARISHA: So 20 hits?

02:17:53.555 --> 02:17:55.138
LIAM: Oh, and it was--

02:17:56.200 --> 02:17:57.121
Never mind.

02:17:57.121 --> 02:17:57.955
So three.

02:18:04.105 --> 02:18:05.105
There we go.

02:18:11.066 --> 02:18:11.898
22.

02:18:13.726 --> 02:18:15.318
MATT: 22 damage?

02:18:15.318 --> 02:18:16.152
All righty.

02:18:17.563 --> 02:18:18.396
Got it.

02:18:19.504 --> 02:18:21.671
Cool, that brings us to--

02:18:24.147 --> 02:18:26.858
The general is going to
attempt to make a saving throw.

02:18:26.858 --> 02:18:27.950
SAM: Shit.

02:18:27.950 --> 02:18:29.045
He can do that?

02:18:29.045 --> 02:18:29.878
MATT: Every time he gets a turn round,

02:18:29.878 --> 02:18:33.127
he gets a chance to break out of the--

02:18:33.127 --> 02:18:34.320
And he does.

02:18:34.320 --> 02:18:35.638
SAM: Oh, he broke out?

02:18:35.638 --> 02:18:36.481
LAURA: (gasps)

02:18:36.481 --> 02:18:39.565
MATT: Shrugs off the mental influence
of the Dominate spell.

02:18:39.565 --> 02:18:42.139
However, he is not currently armed.

02:18:42.139 --> 02:18:43.307
He uses his

02:18:45.535 --> 02:18:49.272
movement, or action to
pick up the war hammer.

02:18:49.272 --> 02:18:50.941
Fury and anger is in his eyes.

02:18:50.941 --> 02:18:52.101
MARISHA: He's still grappled.

02:18:52.101 --> 02:18:53.678
SAM: No no, he just broke out, right?

02:18:53.678 --> 02:18:55.068
MARISHA: Oh, from the grapple, too?

02:18:55.068 --> 02:18:56.752
MATT: Yeah, he used his whole turn
to break out of the grapple

02:18:56.752 --> 02:18:58.147
and grab its weapon, that's all he can do.

02:18:58.147 --> 02:18:59.273
SAM: Where is he?

02:18:59.273 --> 02:19:00.477
MATT: Right there.

02:19:00.477 --> 02:19:01.749
LIAM: To fight the bulette?

02:19:01.749 --> 02:19:02.582
Or to--

02:19:02.582 --> 02:19:03.592
MATT: You have no idea.

02:19:03.592 --> 02:19:04.919
LIAM: Oh, we don't know, oh.

02:19:04.919 --> 02:19:07.427
He could just be reacting to the bulette.

02:19:07.427 --> 02:19:08.894
MATT: The flames on the hammer are out too.

02:19:08.894 --> 02:19:09.924
But it picks up the war hammer,

02:19:09.924 --> 02:19:11.304
it's cold black steel currently.

02:19:11.304 --> 02:19:12.137
TRAVIS: We got our Davy Jones in the room,

02:19:12.137 --> 02:19:13.623
he'll take care of the dwarves.

02:19:13.623 --> 02:19:15.456
MATT: That brings us to...

02:19:16.806 --> 02:19:17.638
Grog.

02:19:17.638 --> 02:19:19.812
TRAVIS: (groans)

02:19:19.812 --> 02:19:20.912
Kitty!

02:19:20.912 --> 02:19:23.939
I would like to go into a frenzied rage,

02:19:23.939 --> 02:19:26.743
and charge at Clifford the big red dog.

02:19:26.743 --> 02:19:28.525
(all alguH)

02:19:28.525 --> 02:19:29.943
MATT: You leap off the higher platofrm,

02:19:29.943 --> 02:19:31.387
come rushing out with your ax in the air,

02:19:31.387 --> 02:19:33.737
as you come down using the
full weight of your body

02:19:33.737 --> 02:19:37.282
behind the attack, go ahead
and roll your three attacks.

02:19:37.282 --> 02:19:40.147
TRAVIS: All right, I have nine, eight, 17.

02:19:40.147 --> 02:19:42.025
SAM: You have one dice from me.

02:19:42.025 --> 02:19:43.386
I've inspired you.

02:19:43.386 --> 02:19:44.825
TRAVIS: Oh.

02:19:44.825 --> 02:19:45.995
SAM: (singing) Grog. Grog.

02:19:45.995 --> 02:19:47.505
TRAVIS: Is it a 20 or is it a what?

02:19:47.505 --> 02:19:49.501
MATT: You get to add a d8 to an attack roll.

02:19:49.501 --> 02:19:51.023
SAM: If you have a shitty attack roll,

02:19:51.023 --> 02:19:53.383
add a d8 to it, if you have a shitty roll.

02:19:53.383 --> 02:19:54.216
TRAVIS: 17.

02:19:54.216 --> 02:19:56.293
ORION: Grog, smash right
through his plate thingy.

02:19:56.293 --> 02:19:58.129
MATT: Barely hits.

02:19:58.129 --> 02:19:58.962
TRAVIS: 19.

02:19:58.962 --> 02:20:00.133
MATT: Hits, all three attacks hit.

02:20:00.133 --> 02:20:02.827
TRAVIS: Yeah, that one hits, 16 plus eight.

02:20:02.827 --> 02:20:04.954
MATT: So all three attacks hit,
roll damage for three hits.

02:20:04.954 --> 02:20:07.422
As you come now, just
slamming your grey ax,

02:20:07.422 --> 02:20:08.900
into the side of this armored beast,

02:20:08.900 --> 02:20:10.282
just over and over again.

02:20:10.282 --> 02:20:12.268
Cleaving this nice little wide section

02:20:12.268 --> 02:20:13.403
of its armor on the side.

02:20:13.403 --> 02:20:15.736
LIAM: Take his fucking head off.

02:20:17.921 --> 02:20:19.366
TRAVIS: 14.

02:20:19.366 --> 02:20:20.199
21.

02:20:24.391 --> 02:20:25.224
21 again.

02:20:26.927 --> 02:20:27.760
ASHLEY: What?

02:20:27.760 --> 02:20:28.593
TRAVIS: 22.

02:20:29.727 --> 02:20:30.832
LAURA: Oh, so.

02:20:30.832 --> 02:20:32.439
22, 21, and 14.

02:20:32.439 --> 02:20:33.272
SAM: Whoa.

02:20:34.221 --> 02:20:35.309
LAURA: I was doing his math.

02:20:35.309 --> 02:20:36.496
(all laugh)

02:20:36.496 --> 02:20:38.351
MATT: 21, 22, and 14 you said?

02:20:38.351 --> 02:20:39.184
ASHLEY: 57?

02:20:39.184 --> 02:20:40.298
SAM: 57.

02:20:40.298 --> 02:20:43.326
TRAVIS: I don't wanna do math and show you all up.

02:20:43.326 --> 02:20:45.810
LIAM: That's a level nine barbarian.

02:20:45.810 --> 02:20:50.265
MATT: So, slam him, you see a portion
of its side armor splits,

02:20:50.265 --> 02:20:54.461
you can see a little bit of
that dark red, fleshy interior.

02:20:54.461 --> 02:20:55.897
You do a significant amount of damage,

02:20:55.897 --> 02:20:57.843
and leave a nice little
weak point in its armor.

02:20:57.843 --> 02:20:59.180
However, it still doesn't seem

02:20:59.180 --> 02:21:00.986
to be entirely phased by the damage,

02:21:00.986 --> 02:21:02.650
it just kinda shrugs at the damage,

02:21:02.650 --> 02:21:03.903
and kinda glares at you for a second.

02:21:03.903 --> 02:21:06.317
One of its eyes that was focused
on Percy and Keyleth,

02:21:06.317 --> 02:21:10.096
now looks over
at you Jurassic-Park style,

02:21:10.096 --> 02:21:13.875
with the t-rex up at
the side of the vehicle.

02:21:13.875 --> 02:21:15.132
Vex?

02:21:15.132 --> 02:21:17.714
LAURA: I back up a little bit.

02:21:17.714 --> 02:21:18.816
Yeah, like that.

02:21:18.816 --> 02:21:22.233
And I'm gonna cast Hail of Thorns on him.

02:21:23.283 --> 02:21:24.563
MATT: Okay.

02:21:24.563 --> 02:21:25.521
SAM: Sounds nasty.

02:21:25.521 --> 02:21:26.354
LAURA: Right?

02:21:28.037 --> 02:21:30.012
I'm gonna shoot like a regular attack.

02:21:30.012 --> 02:21:31.378
MATT: So your bonus action to cast
Hail of Thorns,

02:21:31.378 --> 02:21:33.671
and then you attack
with the arrow, go for it.

02:21:33.671 --> 02:21:34.504
LAURA: Yes.

02:21:36.616 --> 02:21:37.683
MATT: You're adding 11 to it.

02:21:37.683 --> 02:21:40.510
LAURA: Okay, good, then that'd be

02:21:40.510 --> 02:21:41.805
18.

02:21:41.805 --> 02:21:42.829
MATT: 18? 18 hits.

02:21:42.829 --> 02:21:47.535
LAURA: Yes, so I was casting that
as a level three spell.

02:21:47.535 --> 02:21:50.452
I roll 3d-- that means I roll 3d10.

02:21:52.233 --> 02:21:54.014
MATT: Against the creature?

02:21:54.014 --> 02:21:56.264
LAURA: Against 14 which is my

02:21:57.409 --> 02:21:58.992
spell level thingy.

02:22:01.041 --> 02:22:02.632
TRAVIS: 3d10.

02:22:02.632 --> 02:22:04.123
LAURA: Yeah, 1d10 for damage.

02:22:04.123 --> 02:22:05.540
MATT: Yep, go for it.

02:22:08.941 --> 02:22:10.463
LAURA: That is an eight-sided dice, yay!

02:22:10.463 --> 02:22:11.630
MATT: There yougo.

02:22:16.102 --> 02:22:17.600
LAURA: An eight.

02:22:17.600 --> 02:22:18.850
MATT: That'd be 25.

02:22:20.612 --> 02:22:24.362
LAURA: I get another attack,
so I'm gonna do that.

02:22:26.138 --> 02:22:27.383
Natural 20!
(all cheer)

02:22:27.383 --> 02:22:29.441
MATT: Nice, all right, go ahead and roll damage,

02:22:29.441 --> 02:22:31.872
double the dice and add
your modifier of seven.

02:22:31.872 --> 02:22:33.804
LIAM: That arrow just went slow mo.

02:22:33.804 --> 02:22:35.304
LAURA: Double the dice.

02:22:36.417 --> 02:22:37.250
15.

02:22:37.250 --> 02:22:38.083
MATT: 15, all right.

02:22:38.083 --> 02:22:40.729
So what happens here is
you pull an arrow out,

02:22:40.729 --> 02:22:42.292
as you whisper a couple of
words under your breath,

02:22:42.292 --> 02:22:44.349
you see all these thorny
spikes being to shoot out

02:22:44.349 --> 02:22:45.493
the shaft of the arrow.

02:22:45.493 --> 02:22:47.874
You release it and as it strikes
in the front of its face,

02:22:47.874 --> 02:22:49.194
the arrow actually splinters,

02:22:49.194 --> 02:22:51.500
sending a bunch of these
thorns all over its torso,

02:22:51.500 --> 02:22:53.098
piercing an inch or two into its armor

02:22:53.098 --> 02:22:54.943
with each blast of these thorns.

02:22:54.943 --> 02:22:57.077
It kinda rears back and
tries to shake itself off.

02:22:57.077 --> 02:22:59.185
As it does, you get a little bit of a look

02:22:59.185 --> 02:23:00.426
as Grog backs away from it,

02:23:00.426 --> 02:23:01.704
checking to see the wound he left.

02:23:01.704 --> 02:23:04.428
You take your secondary arrow,
aim for the red soft spot,

02:23:04.428 --> 02:23:05.963
boom, slips right past the armor plating,

02:23:05.963 --> 02:23:07.546
doing the extra damage on the interior

02:23:07.546 --> 02:23:09.060
of its physical self.

02:23:09.060 --> 02:23:11.337
Awesome, that's your turn I believe.

02:23:11.337 --> 02:23:12.170
ASHLEY: Good turn.

02:23:12.170 --> 02:23:13.066
MATT: Percy, you're up.

02:23:13.066 --> 02:23:15.782
TALIESIN: Okay, is my hand still stuck in its 
mouth?

02:23:15.782 --> 02:23:18.239
(all laugh)

02:23:18.239 --> 02:23:19.580
TALIESIN: I would like it to be.

02:23:19.580 --> 02:23:22.582
MATT: If you'd like to, yeah,
you could've left it there.

02:23:22.582 --> 02:23:24.467
TALIESIN: Do I have an advantage to hit

02:23:24.467 --> 02:23:26.213
if my gun is in its mouth?

02:23:26.213 --> 02:23:27.593
(all laugh)

02:23:27.593 --> 02:23:30.673
MATT: You are considered grappled
if you leave your hand there.

02:23:30.673 --> 02:23:33.029
You can remain grappled for
advantage on the attack roll.

02:23:33.029 --> 02:23:33.862
TALIESIN: Done.

02:23:35.831 --> 02:23:36.863
So I get to roll twice?

02:23:36.863 --> 02:23:37.982
MATT: You do.

02:23:37.982 --> 02:23:41.732
MARISHA: This is a whole new
meaning to point-blank.

02:23:44.309 --> 02:23:45.320
TALIESIN: 19.

02:23:45.320 --> 02:23:46.863
MATT: 19, that'll hit.

02:23:46.863 --> 02:23:49.022
TALIESIN: Okay, I spent some grit on this,

02:23:49.022 --> 02:23:51.302
and did some interesting modifiers.

02:23:51.302 --> 02:23:52.135
MATT: How much grit did you spend?

02:23:52.135 --> 02:23:52.968
TALIESIN: Two points of grit.

02:23:52.968 --> 02:23:54.801
MATT: Okay, this is the--

02:23:56.334 --> 02:23:57.303
TALIESIN: The Deadshot.

02:23:57.303 --> 02:23:59.720
And I also took a negative

02:24:03.352 --> 02:24:06.487
five hit for a plus ten damage to this shot,

02:24:06.487 --> 02:24:09.409
and I'm using my fire modifier.

02:24:09.409 --> 02:24:10.739
I'm just being an asshole.

02:24:10.739 --> 02:24:13.655
(all laugh)

02:24:13.655 --> 02:24:15.072
MARISHA: That's amazing.

02:24:17.422 --> 02:24:18.339
TALIESIN: That's...

02:24:19.395 --> 02:24:22.194
16 and 20, 35 points of fire damage

02:24:22.194 --> 02:24:24.423
inside of its mouth.

02:24:24.423 --> 02:24:27.363
MATT: So, your hand inside,
you pull back and fire,

02:24:27.363 --> 02:24:28.991
knowing which barrel is next.

02:24:28.991 --> 02:24:31.847
You hear this dull(muffled explosion) sound,

02:24:31.847 --> 02:24:34.055
and its eyes kinda pulse for a second,

02:24:34.055 --> 02:24:35.987
in intense fury and pain,

02:24:35.987 --> 02:24:38.333
smoke just billows out
the sides of its mouth,

02:24:38.333 --> 02:24:41.352
and its nostrils, and it begins
to kind of shake its head,

02:24:41.352 --> 02:24:43.200
lifting you about a foot off the ground,

02:24:43.200 --> 02:24:45.602
painfully, but you think
it's worth the deal.

02:24:45.602 --> 02:24:46.714
Well done.

02:24:46.714 --> 02:24:47.827
TALIESIN: Thank you.

02:24:47.827 --> 02:24:48.660
LIAM: Aw man.

02:24:50.187 --> 02:24:51.400
MATT: I will say that ends your turn.

02:24:51.400 --> 02:24:53.429
LIAM: Thank you Gary Gygax, wherever you are.

02:24:53.429 --> 02:24:55.679
(all laugh)

02:24:57.869 --> 02:24:59.290
MATT: All right.

02:24:59.290 --> 02:25:02.307
The duergar, currently
seeing the situation,

02:25:02.307 --> 02:25:04.642
and the change of tone, go
and grab their weapons.

02:25:04.642 --> 02:25:05.670
TRAVIS: Change of tone.

02:25:05.670 --> 02:25:07.224
(all laugh)

02:25:07.224 --> 02:25:09.214
TRAVIS: Shit got real.

02:25:10.631 --> 02:25:12.374
MATT: This duergar is going to move up,

02:25:12.374 --> 02:25:14.840
back to you, Scanlan, as it sees

02:25:14.840 --> 02:25:16.581
that you were the one that
took over the general.

02:25:16.581 --> 02:25:17.414
SAM: Dicks, bring it.

02:25:17.414 --> 02:25:18.247
LIAM: Dicks.

02:25:18.247 --> 02:25:19.178
MATT: This one comes rushing in.

02:25:19.178 --> 02:25:20.648
MARISHA: Aw, come on.

02:25:20.648 --> 02:25:21.789
LIAM: Freakin' tank in the room.

02:25:21.789 --> 02:25:24.264
MARISHA: There's a bigger problem, bro.

02:25:24.264 --> 02:25:26.231
MATT: Opportunists, man.

02:25:26.231 --> 02:25:28.581
It rushes after you, actually.

02:25:28.581 --> 02:25:30.524
LIAM: ♫ Why can't we be friends

02:25:30.524 --> 02:25:32.882
ALL: ♫ Why can't we be friends

02:25:32.882 --> 02:25:34.496
MATT: All right, the attack against you, Scanlan.

02:25:34.496 --> 02:25:37.126
That is gonna be a 17 versus AC.

02:25:37.126 --> 02:25:39.758
All right, this one is actually
also physically growing

02:25:39.758 --> 02:25:41.530
in size as it comes towards you.

02:25:41.530 --> 02:25:42.511
SAM: It's getting hard.

02:25:42.511 --> 02:25:44.808
(all laugh)

02:25:44.808 --> 02:25:46.058
MATT: You suffer

02:25:48.370 --> 02:25:50.184
16 points of damage.

02:25:50.184 --> 02:25:51.017
ORION: Such a bummer.

02:25:51.017 --> 02:25:52.975
MATT: As the war pick comes
slamming into your side.

02:25:52.975 --> 02:25:55.046
You see it's coming, but
you're just not fast enough.

02:25:55.046 --> 02:25:57.034
It hits you, on impact,
it may have cracked a rib,

02:25:57.034 --> 02:25:58.319
you're not sure.

02:25:58.319 --> 02:26:00.842
The one that's coming
up against you, rolls,

02:26:00.842 --> 02:26:03.577
that's going to be a
17 versus armor class.

02:26:03.577 --> 02:26:04.494
LIAM: Fuck you.

02:26:05.395 --> 02:26:06.642
MATT: You see it and just duck out of the way,

02:26:06.642 --> 02:26:09.399
its war pick slams into
the stone wall next to you,

02:26:09.399 --> 02:26:11.633
with a horrible screeching stone sound.

02:26:13.078 --> 02:26:14.411
High-AC rogue, yo.

02:26:15.283 --> 02:26:17.479
All right that ends their
turn, Tiberius, you're up.

02:26:17.479 --> 02:26:22.025
ORION: I'm looking in, I'm
like, oh, that's no good.

02:26:22.025 --> 02:26:25.992
I look at where he made
the crack in the armor,

02:26:25.992 --> 02:26:27.359
where is that, is that in the head?

02:26:27.359 --> 02:26:28.961
MATT: It's in the head area, right over here.

02:26:28.961 --> 02:26:29.982
ORION: Right, awesome.

02:26:29.982 --> 02:26:34.559
I'm going to kind of motion
towards the mind flayer,

02:26:34.559 --> 02:26:37.183
and give a telepathic wink.

02:26:37.183 --> 02:26:38.354
MATT: It is on the ground.

02:26:38.354 --> 02:26:39.187
ORION: Yeah.

02:26:40.378 --> 02:26:41.521
SAM: Are you flirting with it?

02:26:41.521 --> 02:26:43.029
MATT: You make a telepathic wink.

02:26:43.029 --> 02:26:46.459
ORION: And I'm going to cast Telekinesis,

02:26:46.459 --> 02:26:49.577
and I'm going to pry open the metal.

02:26:49.577 --> 02:26:51.037
I'm not going to target the creature,

02:26:51.037 --> 02:26:53.111
I'm going to target the armor.

02:26:53.111 --> 02:26:53.944
TRAVIS: Nice.

02:26:54.922 --> 02:26:55.898
MATT: Interesting thought, okay.

02:26:55.898 --> 02:26:58.717
See if it-- the 17 is the DC?

02:26:58.717 --> 02:26:59.550
ORION: Yes.

02:26:59.550 --> 02:27:00.584
TRAVIS: This could be cool.

02:27:00.584 --> 02:27:02.392
MATT: All right, it fails.

02:27:04.293 --> 02:27:05.781
So here's what happens.

02:27:05.781 --> 02:27:07.698
For the effect of this.

02:27:08.561 --> 02:27:10.434
It suffers, I'm gonna say it suffers

02:27:10.434 --> 02:27:14.228
about 2d6 points of
damage from the tearing.

02:27:14.228 --> 02:27:15.876
So go ahead and roll that.

02:27:15.876 --> 02:27:16.709
ORION: Six damage.

02:27:16.709 --> 02:27:18.141
MATT: So six damage, however,

02:27:18.141 --> 02:27:20.526
you have effectively reduced
its armor class by five.

02:27:20.526 --> 02:27:21.359
TRAVIS: Yes!

02:27:21.359 --> 02:27:22.192
MATT: In doing so.

02:27:22.192 --> 02:27:23.025
SAM: Ooh!

02:27:24.299 --> 02:27:29.004
ORION: And I'm going to spend
two more sorcery points,

02:27:29.004 --> 02:27:30.653
and do the spell again.

02:27:30.653 --> 02:27:32.320
I'm going to do a--

02:27:36.949 --> 02:27:39.815
I'm gonna do Firebolt, right in the hole.

02:27:39.815 --> 02:27:41.680
And I'm going to use my metamagic wand

02:27:41.680 --> 02:27:42.978
to fire the spell.

02:27:42.978 --> 02:27:44.285
MARISHA: Fire in the hole!

02:27:44.285 --> 02:27:46.035
MATT: All right, go for it!

02:27:47.630 --> 02:27:50.630
SAM: He has so many dice, it's crazy.

02:27:52.079 --> 02:27:53.412
ORION: Oh, that hits.

02:27:54.405 --> 02:27:57.215
TALIESIN: Actually, does that
crit? Does your 19 crit?

02:27:57.215 --> 02:27:58.650
MATT: No.

02:27:58.650 --> 02:28:01.733
Usually, 20 is only crit, except for,

02:28:02.799 --> 02:28:04.211
I think he has a bonus ability.

02:28:04.211 --> 02:28:06.661
SAM: Critical Role by the
way, name of the show.

02:28:06.661 --> 02:28:09.622
(all laugh)

02:28:09.622 --> 02:28:12.475
MATT: It's okay, you're good,
and you're a fighter,

02:28:12.475 --> 02:28:13.531
which means eventually you'll end up

02:28:13.531 --> 02:28:16.766
with four attacks per round anyway, so 
you're fine.

02:28:16.766 --> 02:28:17.599
ORION: Can't do that.

02:28:17.599 --> 02:28:20.021
TALIESIN: I'm looking forward to it.

02:28:26.358 --> 02:28:29.138
MATT: Damage, what you got?
Scanlan, you're on deck, by the way.

02:28:29.138 --> 02:28:30.138
SAM: I'm ready.

02:28:31.140 --> 02:28:33.156
ORION: I zap him, I zap him for one.

02:28:33.156 --> 02:28:33.989
MATT: Okay.

02:28:33.989 --> 02:28:36.174
(all laugh)

02:28:36.174 --> 02:28:37.942
ORION: No, no no no, I empowered it.

02:28:37.942 --> 02:28:39.822
Full, it takes ten damage.

02:28:39.822 --> 02:28:41.872
'Cause I empowered the spell.

02:28:41.872 --> 02:28:43.521
MATT: That's correct, so.

02:28:43.521 --> 02:28:44.739
As you pull down with the ray,

02:28:44.739 --> 02:28:47.981
it streaks down across the
ceiling portion of the building,

02:28:47.981 --> 02:28:50.565
right into the fleshy,
exposed part of its armor,

02:28:50.565 --> 02:28:52.174
now it looks like it has
this giant jagged scar

02:28:52.174 --> 02:28:53.007
in the side of its head,

02:28:53.007 --> 02:28:54.690
where you can see muscle and sinew

02:28:54.690 --> 02:28:56.479
pulsing with each of its movements.

02:28:56.479 --> 02:28:57.438
You blast into it,

02:28:57.438 --> 02:28:59.478
you can see this darkened black portion

02:28:59.478 --> 02:29:02.472
of its interior flesh, it's now charred,

02:29:02.472 --> 02:29:04.302
slight embers beginning to percolate

02:29:04.302 --> 02:29:08.086
and burn on the outskirts of the impact.

02:29:08.086 --> 02:29:10.762
Well done, you gonna stay where you are?

02:29:10.762 --> 02:29:12.391
ORION: Yes.

02:29:12.391 --> 02:29:13.494
MATT: Scanlan, what you got?

02:29:13.494 --> 02:29:15.935
SAM: Okay, I'm going, I know
he'll get a hit on me,

02:29:15.935 --> 02:29:18.774
but I'm gonna run away
from the guy behind me,

02:29:18.774 --> 02:29:20.719
run straight at the general,

02:29:20.719 --> 02:29:25.394
and just open out my arms
in an outstretched big hug,

02:29:25.394 --> 02:29:28.541
and I'm like, come here
big guy, come here!

02:29:28.541 --> 02:29:30.511
And I give him a big hug,
and upon touching him,

02:29:30.511 --> 02:29:31.997
I cast Banishment on him

02:29:31.997 --> 02:29:33.732
and send him to another dimension.

02:29:33.732 --> 02:29:34.793
ORION: Nice!

02:29:34.793 --> 02:29:35.626
MATT: All right.

02:29:35.626 --> 02:29:38.124
(all laugh)

02:29:38.124 --> 02:29:42.357
MATT: As you move away, the duergar
is going to attempt to make,

02:29:42.357 --> 02:29:44.618
as a reaction, to make an attack on you.

02:29:44.618 --> 02:29:46.026
SAM: It's okay, it's all cool for Pike.

02:29:46.026 --> 02:29:49.020
MATT: That's going to be a
13 versus armor class.

02:29:49.020 --> 02:29:50.371
SAM: Does not hit.

02:29:50.371 --> 02:29:53.551
MATT: You hear it coming, as
you're walking, "buddy!"

02:29:53.551 --> 02:29:55.647
(all laugh)

02:29:55.647 --> 02:29:57.480
MATT: Duck under a war pick.

02:29:59.395 --> 02:30:00.584
MATT: With advantage on its saving throw.

02:30:00.584 --> 02:30:02.149
What's the DC?

02:30:02.149 --> 02:30:02.982
SAM: DC?

02:30:02.982 --> 02:30:03.816
MATT: The DC on your spell?

02:30:03.816 --> 02:30:07.371
SAM: Well, if I'm doing it
through my cone, it's 19.

02:30:07.371 --> 02:30:09.200
MATT: I will say for this, you do
not have it through your cone,

02:30:09.200 --> 02:30:11.151
because you had your arms
open, you didn't specify,

02:30:11.151 --> 02:30:13.579
however, it still fails

02:30:13.579 --> 02:30:16.647
it's saving throw. The
general, as you reach up,

02:30:16.647 --> 02:30:18.203
he has his war pick ready.

02:30:18.203 --> 02:30:22.357
Pulls back its war pick
as the flames burst in.

02:30:22.357 --> 02:30:23.288
(all laugh)

02:30:23.288 --> 02:30:26.578
MATT: Then blinks out of existence.

02:30:26.578 --> 02:30:27.905
(all cheer)

02:30:27.905 --> 02:30:28.795
ORION: Nice move.

02:30:28.795 --> 02:30:29.628
ASHLEY: One down, one down.

02:30:29.628 --> 02:30:32.099
SAM: Oh, he's gone, oh, where did he go?

02:30:32.099 --> 02:30:33.590
I don't know.

02:30:33.590 --> 02:30:34.870
MATT: How long does it last, by the way?

02:30:34.870 --> 02:30:36.168
SAM: It's concentration.

02:30:36.168 --> 02:30:37.795
(all laugh)

02:30:37.795 --> 02:30:39.128
MATT: Okay. All right.

02:30:40.506 --> 02:30:42.570
LIAM: Scanlan Shorthalt, playing Vegas,
ladies and gentlemen.

02:30:42.570 --> 02:30:43.981
SAM: Do I get a bonus?

02:30:43.981 --> 02:30:45.084
MATT: You do get a bonus action.

02:30:45.084 --> 02:30:47.426
SAM: Okay, I'm just going
to sing a little ditty

02:30:47.426 --> 02:30:49.931
to Pike, just to give
her a little inspiration.

02:30:49.931 --> 02:30:52.146
I'll just do some pelvic
thrusting--

02:30:52.146 --> 02:30:55.111
a little (guitar),

02:30:55.111 --> 02:30:56.280
that's a flute, by the way.

02:30:56.280 --> 02:30:58.049
(all laugh)

02:30:58.049 --> 02:31:00.454
ORION: Super, play that thing.

02:31:00.454 --> 02:31:03.056
MATT: His electric flute gives
you a d8 inspiration dice,

02:31:03.056 --> 02:31:04.995
so you can add that to any attack rolls.

02:31:04.995 --> 02:31:08.629
LIAM: He can do anything with any instrument.

02:31:08.629 --> 02:31:10.003
ASHLEY: Sweet licks on your flute.

02:31:10.003 --> 02:31:12.253
(all laugh)

02:31:16.967 --> 02:31:18.684
MATT: All right, so, Keyleth.

02:31:18.684 --> 02:31:21.775
MARISHA: So, upon seeing this big thing crash in,

02:31:21.775 --> 02:31:23.275
and I'm like, oh.

02:31:24.891 --> 02:31:26.203
Now you're really angry.

02:31:26.203 --> 02:31:29.500
But I just kind of analyze
him and I say okay,

02:31:29.500 --> 02:31:32.195
and then I go, (grunts),

02:31:32.195 --> 02:31:34.921
and I turn into a rhinoceros.

02:31:34.921 --> 02:31:35.754
ALL: Ooh!

02:31:37.089 --> 02:31:39.824
MATT: Okay, I don't have a
rhinoceros mini on me,

02:31:39.824 --> 02:31:42.224
so we'll use a bear for the time being,

02:31:42.224 --> 02:31:43.398
but we'll know it's a rhinoceros.

02:31:43.398 --> 02:31:44.807
SAM: Why don't you have a rhinoceros?

02:31:44.807 --> 02:31:46.962
MATT: 'Cause I was not prepared for such things.

02:31:46.962 --> 02:31:48.604
LIAM: Way to slack off, Mercer.

02:31:48.604 --> 02:31:52.637
MATT: Hey, I'm gonna order a
rhinoceros now, you happy?

02:31:52.637 --> 02:31:54.455
I'm gonna go to Toys R Us.

02:31:54.455 --> 02:31:55.791
TALIESIN: Get the whole animal collection.

02:31:55.791 --> 02:31:58.390
Actually got them, the whole set.

02:31:58.390 --> 02:32:00.733
MATT: So you transform into a rhinoceros,

02:32:00.733 --> 02:32:02.572
now basically facing an armored beast

02:32:02.572 --> 02:32:04.405
with an armored beast.

02:32:05.491 --> 02:32:07.031
MARISHA: Kaiju battle.

02:32:07.031 --> 02:32:08.963
(all laugh)

02:32:08.963 --> 02:32:09.796
MATT: Whatcha got, whatcha doing?

02:32:09.796 --> 02:32:11.393
MARISHA: I'm charging him.

02:32:14.398 --> 02:32:16.407
TRAVIS: Activity in the Breach.

02:32:16.407 --> 02:32:18.516
MATT: You leap down, go in for the attack,

02:32:18.516 --> 02:32:20.313
this duergar already used its reaction,

02:32:20.313 --> 02:32:21.578
so it can't attack you.

02:32:21.578 --> 02:32:25.161
MARISHA: So if he fails to save, I knock him over.

02:32:26.394 --> 02:32:28.975
That's plus seven, so 19?

02:32:28.975 --> 02:32:29.970
MATT: 19 does hit.

02:32:29.970 --> 02:32:30.803
MARISHA: Awesome!

02:32:32.039 --> 02:32:33.495
MATT: Does save though, is not knocked over.

02:32:33.495 --> 02:32:34.396
MARISHA: A strength save?

02:32:34.396 --> 02:32:35.229
MATT: Yeah.

02:32:35.229 --> 02:32:36.062
MARISHA: Aw, damn it.

02:32:36.062 --> 02:32:38.041
MATT: This is a big creature.

02:32:38.041 --> 02:32:39.541
MARISHA: He does, I do

02:32:40.941 --> 02:32:43.006
2d8 of bludgeoning damage.

02:32:43.006 --> 02:32:44.006
MATT: Go for it.

02:32:45.782 --> 02:32:48.593
MARISHA: Seven, nine, 14 damage.

02:32:48.593 --> 02:32:50.343
MATT: 14 damage, all right.

02:32:51.562 --> 02:32:53.080
You have multi attack or
did you get the one hit?

02:32:53.080 --> 02:32:54.529
MARISHA: Well, I charged, yeah.

02:32:54.529 --> 02:32:55.924
MATT: Okay yeah, so the charge is the hit.

02:32:55.924 --> 02:32:57.797
But you slam into it, your horn gores,

02:32:57.797 --> 02:32:58.630
you can see actually,

02:32:58.630 --> 02:33:00.545
you slam it into the
side of the armor wound

02:33:00.545 --> 02:33:03.307
that Grog left and then
Tiberius pried open.

02:33:03.307 --> 02:33:04.222
Part of it gets pulled back,

02:33:04.222 --> 02:33:06.809
and you see a quick
splatter of some sort of

02:33:06.809 --> 02:33:10.094
bloody splash as you're
staring to actually

02:33:10.094 --> 02:33:12.367
pull apart its interior.

02:33:12.367 --> 02:33:13.693
The horn is jabbed in there,

02:33:13.693 --> 02:33:15.730
and it manages to shrug
it off at the last point.

02:33:15.730 --> 02:33:17.920
You do significant gore to its side.

02:33:17.920 --> 02:33:18.837
LIAM: Good musical riff.

02:33:20.620 --> 02:33:21.912
MARISHA: Oh, wait.

02:33:21.912 --> 02:33:24.739
No no no, that's right, keep going.

02:33:24.739 --> 02:33:27.189
It's actually 15 damage.

02:33:27.189 --> 02:33:29.435
I always forget that I have a plus
one to attack.

02:33:29.435 --> 02:33:30.268
MATT: 15? Yeah, don't forget that.

02:33:30.268 --> 02:33:31.101
You need to remember that.

02:33:36.412 --> 02:33:38.580
After taking the arrow wound,

02:33:38.580 --> 02:33:40.136
and after everyone else
attacking around it,

02:33:40.136 --> 02:33:42.467
it's going to try and get
a different situation.

02:33:42.467 --> 02:33:44.050
It's going to jump.

02:33:45.202 --> 02:33:49.072
It rears back, and leaps into the air.

02:33:49.072 --> 02:33:49.905
SAM: Oh jesus.

02:33:51.824 --> 02:33:55.895
MATT: Landing right on top
of Clarota and Scanlan.

02:33:55.895 --> 02:33:57.062
SAM: Oh no!

02:33:59.192 --> 02:34:00.622
ASHLEY: Wait, does he get, do we get--

02:34:00.622 --> 02:34:03.917
MATT: You guys all get attacks
on it as it jumps away.

02:34:03.917 --> 02:34:04.828
MARISHA: We all get attacks?

02:34:04.828 --> 02:34:05.661
MATT: Yes, you do.

02:34:05.661 --> 02:34:06.676
SAM: Do I?

02:34:06.676 --> 02:34:07.696
MATT: No, you do not.

02:34:07.696 --> 02:34:08.912
MARISHA: We get advantage, right?

02:34:08.912 --> 02:34:09.745
MATT: No.

02:34:09.745 --> 02:34:11.644
TALIESIN: Did he take me, no he didn't take me.

02:34:11.644 --> 02:34:14.149
MATT: No, actually, you are still in its hand.

02:34:14.149 --> 02:34:16.133
In its mouth, it carries you with it.

02:34:18.729 --> 02:34:19.562
MARISHA: 19.

02:34:20.999 --> 02:34:23.471
MATT: Okay, so 19, you hit.

02:34:23.471 --> 02:34:24.491
LIAM: 24.
MATT: Hit.

02:34:24.491 --> 02:34:25.408
TRAVIS: 26.
MATT: Hit.

02:34:29.627 --> 02:34:30.781
No, it's the three of you, so that's it.

02:34:30.781 --> 02:34:32.966
So all of you guys just roll
damage for a basic attack.

02:34:32.966 --> 02:34:34.282
SAM: Come on, kill him before he gets to me.

02:34:34.282 --> 02:34:35.275
TRAVIS: 24.

02:34:35.275 --> 02:34:36.275
MATT: 24 damage?

02:34:37.673 --> 02:34:38.918
24 damage you said?

02:34:38.918 --> 02:34:39.751
Nice.
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:34:39.751 --> 02:34:41.385
ASHLEY: Was I close enough to
him to get an attack?

02:34:41.385 --> 02:34:43.382
MATT: No you weren't, unfortunately.

02:34:43.382 --> 02:34:44.215
LIAM: 11.

02:34:44.215 --> 02:34:45.607
MATT: 11, all righty, and?

02:34:45.607 --> 02:34:46.440
MARISHA: 17.

02:34:46.440 --> 02:34:47.471
ASHLEY: Yeah.

02:34:47.471 --> 02:34:48.971
MATT: So, as it lands.

02:34:51.280 --> 02:34:53.045
All of you guys have to make a strength

02:34:53.045 --> 02:34:56.123
or dex saving throw, your choice.

02:34:56.123 --> 02:34:57.714
For Percy.

02:34:57.714 --> 02:34:59.117
TALIESIN: Dex.

02:34:59.117 --> 02:35:02.832
MATT: And Scanlan, and I'm rolling for Clarota.

02:35:02.832 --> 02:35:03.999
Clarota fails.

02:35:05.190 --> 02:35:06.219
TALIESIN: 20.

02:35:06.219 --> 02:35:08.829
MATT: It's okay, it's okay, Scanlan.

02:35:08.829 --> 02:35:10.301
It's okay, you can do this.

02:35:10.301 --> 02:35:13.134
MATT: What'd you roll?
TALIESIN: 20.

02:35:14.133 --> 02:35:16.153
SAM: He's coming back from the other dimension.

02:35:16.153 --> 02:35:17.486
I rolled a nine.

02:35:20.295 --> 02:35:21.658
ORION: Did it hit the floor or did you go again?

02:35:21.658 --> 02:35:23.823
SAM: No, I used the one that
rolled on the floor.

02:35:23.823 --> 02:35:25.288
LAURA: Roll it on the table, that doesn't count.

02:35:25.288 --> 02:35:27.527
MATT: So Clarota is not prone.

02:35:27.527 --> 02:35:30.372
SAM: Dungeon Master, does a
roll on the floor count?

02:35:30.372 --> 02:35:31.205
What happened?

02:35:31.205 --> 02:35:32.038
MATT: I usually roll on the table.

02:35:32.038 --> 02:35:33.957
I usually prefer to roll on the table.

02:35:33.957 --> 02:35:34.893
SAM: It's even worse.

02:35:34.893 --> 02:35:37.299
(all laugh)

02:35:37.299 --> 02:35:38.661
LIAM: That'll learn ya.

02:35:38.661 --> 02:35:41.090
MATT: You guys are knocked prone on the ground,

02:35:41.090 --> 02:35:45.292
and you all take 14 points
of bludgeoning damage,

02:35:45.292 --> 02:35:47.293
plus 14 points of slashing damage.

02:35:47.293 --> 02:35:48.693
As he just lands on top of you.

02:35:48.693 --> 02:35:51.445
Yeah, so 28 points of
damage, as it crushes you,

02:35:51.445 --> 02:35:53.169
and its claws sink into you.

02:35:53.169 --> 02:35:54.951
Clarota takes the same.

02:35:54.951 --> 02:35:56.571
LIAM: Did it drag Percy through the air?

02:35:56.571 --> 02:35:57.834
TALIESIN: Yes it did.

02:35:57.834 --> 02:35:58.706
LAURA: It did?

02:35:58.706 --> 02:36:01.091
TALIESIN: My arms are still stuck in its mouth.

02:36:01.091 --> 02:36:01.924
MATT: You're not knocked prone,

02:36:01.924 --> 02:36:04.210
but you do take 14 points
of crushing damage,

02:36:04.210 --> 02:36:07.163
as its mouth bites down on
your arm again, for free.

02:36:07.163 --> 02:36:07.996
TALIESIN: That's fine.

02:36:07.996 --> 02:36:11.663
MATT: It's going to actually release you, Percy.

02:36:13.684 --> 02:36:15.706
So you're there.

02:36:15.706 --> 02:36:16.539
MARISHA: Think your arm might be a 
bit busted.

02:36:16.539 --> 02:36:21.124
MATT: It turns, and makes a bite
attack against Scanlan.

02:36:21.124 --> 02:36:22.374
SCANLAN: As he does

02:36:23.687 --> 02:36:24.937
I distract him.

02:36:26.344 --> 02:36:29.131
(air horn blowing)

02:36:29.131 --> 02:36:31.350
(all laugh)

02:36:31.350 --> 02:36:32.767
SAM: Playing my shawm.

02:36:33.663 --> 02:36:35.390
MATT: That's the sound a shawm makes?

02:36:35.390 --> 02:36:36.756
SAM: Cutting Words reaction.

02:36:36.756 --> 02:36:37.954
MATT: Okay, so as your reaction,

02:36:37.954 --> 02:36:39.905
go ahead and do that, so roll the d8.

02:36:39.905 --> 02:36:41.840
ASHLEY: (imitates horn)

02:36:41.840 --> 02:36:43.800
TRAVIS: It's like the start of a Pitbull song.

02:36:43.800 --> 02:36:44.892
SAM: Six.

02:36:44.892 --> 02:36:47.424
MATT: Okay, he rolled a 27.

02:36:47.424 --> 02:36:49.114
Reduced it by seven to 19.

02:36:49.114 --> 02:36:51.140
So even with the reduction, it's not enough,

02:36:51.140 --> 02:36:52.890
you're on the ground.

02:36:54.784 --> 02:36:56.796
It sinks its teeth right into you.

02:36:56.796 --> 02:36:58.629
You take, let's see.

02:37:02.573 --> 02:37:04.465
LIAM: These games keep getting better.

02:37:04.465 --> 02:37:06.691
MATT: You take 41 points of piercing damage.

02:37:06.691 --> 02:37:08.796
LAURA: Oh my gosh.

02:37:08.796 --> 02:37:09.698
LIAM: Scanlan!

02:37:09.698 --> 02:37:12.303
SAM: No worries, I'm just at negative 36 now.

02:37:12.303 --> 02:37:13.814
(all laugh)

02:37:13.814 --> 02:37:14.647
MARISHA: Really?

02:37:14.647 --> 02:37:15.480
SAM: Yep.

02:37:15.480 --> 02:37:16.989
MATT: Okay, so.

02:37:16.989 --> 02:37:19.427
MARISHA: Wait, how did that happen?

02:37:19.427 --> 02:37:20.736
TALIESIN: That happened fast.

02:37:20.736 --> 02:37:22.323
LIAM: He's unconscious, he's in bad shape,

02:37:22.323 --> 02:37:23.156
but we're gonna get him.

02:37:23.156 --> 02:37:23.989
MATT: Scanlan's looking rough,

02:37:23.989 --> 02:37:25.818
Scanlan is now just being thrashed around

02:37:25.818 --> 02:37:26.651
in the mouth of the creature.

02:37:26.651 --> 02:37:27.630
TRAVIS: How many hit points do you have?

02:37:27.630 --> 02:37:30.217
MATT: His limp arms and legs
just (thumping)

02:37:30.217 --> 02:37:32.346
as it's kind of just running him around

02:37:32.346 --> 02:37:33.659
and across the air.

02:37:33.659 --> 02:37:35.126
LIAM: Hashtag save Scanlan.

02:37:35.126 --> 02:37:37.582
Strings of gnome blood are
being flung across the room.

02:37:37.582 --> 02:37:41.227
LIAM: Oh, he's so little though, he's so little.

02:37:41.227 --> 02:37:42.140
MATT: Pike, your turn.

02:37:42.140 --> 02:37:44.890
ASHLEY: Okay, so time for a Cure Wounds.

02:37:45.816 --> 02:37:46.733
So I guess.

02:37:47.722 --> 02:37:49.259
Let's see.

02:37:49.259 --> 02:37:51.714
MATT: You can't even see him right now.

02:37:51.714 --> 02:37:54.004
If you want to Cure Wounds,
you have to touch him.

02:37:54.004 --> 02:37:56.560
ASHLEY: I'll go, yeah, I'll go.

02:37:56.560 --> 02:37:58.396
SAM: I'm being thrashed around.

02:37:58.396 --> 02:38:00.660
ASHLEY: Can I just go, he's over there?

02:38:00.660 --> 02:38:02.425
LAURA: He's in the mouth of the thing.

02:38:02.425 --> 02:38:03.753
LIAM: She's 25 speed.

02:38:03.753 --> 02:38:06.239
MATT: So you can move five squares.

02:38:06.239 --> 02:38:07.266
ASHLEY: Okay.

02:38:07.266 --> 02:38:09.932
MARISHA: Didn't you get that speed boost?

02:38:09.932 --> 02:38:11.216
ASHLEY: How close can I get to him?

02:38:11.216 --> 02:38:12.764
I can't see the lines in the squares.

02:38:12.764 --> 02:38:14.201
ORION: Don't forget your boots, Pike.

02:38:14.201 --> 02:38:16.701
ASHLEY: Oh, I have sprinter's boots!

02:38:17.548 --> 02:38:19.515
I have sprinter's boots.

02:38:21.266 --> 02:38:25.239
Okay, so I'm gonna use
my sprinter's boots.

02:38:25.239 --> 02:38:26.072
I can--

02:38:27.042 --> 02:38:29.183
While you wear these boots,
you can use a bonus action,

02:38:29.183 --> 02:38:30.969
and click the boots' heels together,

02:38:30.969 --> 02:38:32.870
if you do, the boots
double your walking speed

02:38:32.870 --> 02:38:33.787
for one minute.

02:38:33.787 --> 02:38:36.102
MATT: So you can move ten squares,
takes your bonus action.

02:38:36.102 --> 02:38:39.057
ASHLEY: So then, I'm so sorry, I
can't see the squares.

02:38:39.057 --> 02:38:40.963
So if I can get ten to get over there.

02:38:40.963 --> 02:38:43.906
MATT: So you go one, two, three, four, five,

02:38:43.906 --> 02:38:47.443
six, seven, eight, there is a ledge there,

02:38:47.443 --> 02:38:49.891
and he's blocking the way up, so nine, ten,

02:38:49.891 --> 02:38:51.627
make an acrobatics check to actually

02:38:51.627 --> 02:38:53.837
jump and climb up onto the--

02:38:53.837 --> 02:38:55.397
LAURA: Oh no.

02:38:55.397 --> 02:39:00.056
MATT: With disadvantage, 'cause
you have plate armor.

02:39:00.056 --> 02:39:02.911
LIAM: But what about her--

02:39:02.911 --> 02:39:04.903
MATT: Disadvantage, you roll
twice and take a lower.

02:39:04.903 --> 02:39:06.736
ASHLEY: Wait, wait, hold on.

02:39:07.594 --> 02:39:09.844
Can I cast Guided Strike?

02:39:09.844 --> 02:39:11.427
Which adds ten to--

02:39:13.292 --> 02:39:15.052
SAM: I gave you a dice.

02:39:15.052 --> 02:39:17.290
I gave you a dice.

02:39:17.290 --> 02:39:20.002
LIAM: Which means you're--

02:39:20.002 --> 02:39:20.835
Ten.

02:39:20.835 --> 02:39:21.671
MATT: Total of ten?

02:39:21.671 --> 02:39:22.504
LIAM: Yeah.

02:39:22.504 --> 02:39:23.337
MATT: That's exactly what you needed.

02:39:23.337 --> 02:39:24.545
(all cheer)

02:39:24.545 --> 02:39:25.885
MATT: That was the baseline. You run up,

02:39:25.885 --> 02:39:27.817
it takes all the strength you can feel,

02:39:27.817 --> 02:39:28.796
you're gonna be sore in the morning.

02:39:28.796 --> 02:39:30.962
All your muscles tense
as you pull yourself up,

02:39:30.962 --> 02:39:33.409
with all the inertia from the run,

02:39:33.409 --> 02:39:35.912
your parkour up to the top, land,

02:39:35.912 --> 02:39:37.864
Scanlan's there, currently
being flung around,

02:39:37.864 --> 02:39:39.386
you manage to reach up and grab him,

02:39:39.386 --> 02:39:42.601
and get in a brief tug of war
with the bulette creature.

02:39:42.601 --> 02:39:44.474
ASHLEY: Hey, get away from him, man!

02:39:44.474 --> 02:39:46.308
MATT: As you cast Cure Wounds.

02:39:46.308 --> 02:39:47.391
Go ahead and--

02:39:48.251 --> 02:39:51.320
ASHLEY: So that's Mass Cure Wounds, so does that heal--

02:39:51.320 --> 02:39:52.969
MATT: Is it Mass Cure Wounds, or
just doing Cure Wounds?

02:39:52.969 --> 02:39:54.390
ASHLEY: I'll just do Cure Wounds.

02:39:54.390 --> 02:39:56.263
MATT: So at what level are you using?

02:39:56.263 --> 02:39:57.144
SAM: Don't chintz out.

02:39:57.144 --> 02:39:58.634
ASHLEY: I'm gonna use it at the highest-- I'll use it at fifth level.

02:39:58.634 --> 02:39:59.823
SAM: Cast whatever you can cast.

02:39:59.823 --> 02:40:00.819
LIAM: It's one or multiple people.

02:40:00.819 --> 02:40:02.832
SAM: Can you do it at a higher level?

02:40:02.832 --> 02:40:04.672
ASHLEY: Yeah, I'll do it at my highest
level that I can cast,

02:40:04.672 --> 02:40:05.505
which is--

02:40:05.505 --> 02:40:07.391
SAM: Let's not cheap out on Scanlan here.

02:40:07.391 --> 02:40:11.009
ASHLEY: Sorry guys, I'm just warming up again.

02:40:11.009 --> 02:40:13.259
(all laugh)

02:40:14.490 --> 02:40:16.907
TRAVIS: Let's not skimp on Scanlan.

02:40:18.631 --> 02:40:20.646
LIAM: Remember when I brought
you back from the dead?

02:40:20.646 --> 02:40:21.733
Remember that? Remember that?

02:40:21.733 --> 02:40:23.958
SAM: Remember when my kiss
healed you from death?

02:40:23.958 --> 02:40:25.142
Just throwing that out there.

02:40:25.142 --> 02:40:26.164
ASHLEY: -- which I think is eight.

02:40:26.164 --> 02:40:28.150
MATT: So it's 5d8 + 5.

02:40:28.150 --> 02:40:31.053
5d8 + 5 is how
much you're healing him.

02:40:31.053 --> 02:40:31.886
LIAM: You're gonna be all right.

02:40:31.886 --> 02:40:34.040
ASHLEY: My spell attack bonus, plus eight?

02:40:34.040 --> 02:40:35.137
MATT: You don't have to worry about the bonus,

02:40:35.137 --> 02:40:35.970
you're just touching him.

02:40:35.970 --> 02:40:37.261
ASHLEY: So 5d8 + 5.

02:40:37.261 --> 02:40:40.094
MATT: Is what you're healing him, yes.

02:40:46.771 --> 02:40:47.604
All right.

02:40:49.297 --> 02:40:50.130
SAM: That's three.

02:40:50.130 --> 02:40:53.019
LIAM: I think you did it four times, yeah.

02:40:53.019 --> 02:40:53.852
ASHLEY: 18, plus five.

02:40:53.852 --> 02:40:56.435
SAM: I thought that was three, no?

02:40:57.333 --> 02:40:59.263
ASHLEY: Yeah, 23, 23.

02:40:59.263 --> 02:41:00.838
SAM: Plus five.

02:41:00.838 --> 02:41:03.261
LIAM: That was plus five.

02:41:03.261 --> 02:41:04.699
LAURA: Are you still unconscious?

02:41:04.699 --> 02:41:07.282
SAM: But now I'm only negative 11.

02:41:08.168 --> 02:41:09.753
ASHLEY: Wait, what?

02:41:09.753 --> 02:41:12.967
SAM: I've taken almost 100
points of damage in this.

02:41:12.967 --> 02:41:15.446
MATT: You're unconscious, how it works in this,

02:41:15.446 --> 02:41:17.317
and this is different from Pathfinder--

02:41:17.317 --> 02:41:18.592
Yeah, you go to zero and you stay there.

02:41:18.592 --> 02:41:20.519
You are now up to 23.

02:41:20.519 --> 02:41:22.291
LIAM: You don't go below zero, you hit zero,

02:41:22.291 --> 02:41:25.289
and you're there, making
rolls to see if you die.

02:41:25.289 --> 02:41:27.544
LAURA: You only have three chances if you roll,

02:41:27.544 --> 02:41:29.361
fail, three times, you die.

02:41:29.361 --> 02:41:31.111
MATT: And if something hits you
while you're unconscious,

02:41:31.111 --> 02:41:32.526
it's an automatic fail.

02:41:32.526 --> 02:41:34.330
Now you're 23 hit points.

02:41:34.330 --> 02:41:36.305
SAM: Hey, I feel great, guys!
(all laugh)

02:41:36.305 --> 02:41:38.165
MATT: You're still in its
mouth being shook around.

02:41:38.165 --> 02:41:40.734
SAM: Oh shit!
(all laugh)

02:41:40.734 --> 02:41:43.683
SAM: What is this ride?

02:41:43.683 --> 02:41:44.850
This is crazy!

02:41:45.774 --> 02:41:47.948
MATT: Pike, that's your turn.

02:41:47.948 --> 02:41:49.099
ASHLEY: I can't do anything else, right?

02:41:49.099 --> 02:41:50.887
MATT: Clarota's going to get up.

02:41:50.887 --> 02:41:52.452
LIAM: Come on Clarota, show us what you got.

02:41:52.452 --> 02:41:54.743
MATT: Clarota looks pretty rough.

02:41:54.743 --> 02:41:55.576
Rears back.

02:41:55.576 --> 02:41:56.693
LIAM: Got to bring that mental power

02:41:56.693 --> 02:41:59.737
and that arcane magic, let's do it.

02:41:59.737 --> 02:42:03.288
MATT: Taking a cue from the opening you left,

02:42:03.288 --> 02:42:05.621
Clarota pulls back its hand,

02:42:06.683 --> 02:42:09.725
you see a familiar spark
of bluish electrical energy

02:42:09.725 --> 02:42:11.911
as Clarota reaches for
unleashing a torrent

02:42:11.911 --> 02:42:13.362
of electrical arcane energy forward,

02:42:13.362 --> 02:42:14.998
into the form of a Lightning Bolt.

02:42:14.998 --> 02:42:18.997
Blasting across the bow
of this giant creature.

02:42:18.997 --> 02:42:19.830
Let's see.

02:42:21.105 --> 02:42:24.438
Does not make its saving throw, so it's

02:42:30.816 --> 02:42:32.369
32 points of lightning damage.

02:42:32.369 --> 02:42:33.202
LAURA: Clarota!

02:42:34.674 --> 02:42:36.187
MATT: As the back of its armor is now seared,

02:42:36.187 --> 02:42:38.266
and you can see parts of its armored flesh

02:42:38.266 --> 02:42:42.240
are kind of blackened and
charred and slightly crimping.

02:42:43.073 --> 02:42:44.355
Vax, you're up.

02:42:44.355 --> 02:42:45.476
LIAM: Okay,

02:42:45.476 --> 02:42:49.050
so I've got enough room
to run up to its anus,

02:42:49.050 --> 02:42:50.258
which I'll do.

02:42:50.258 --> 02:42:51.542
TRAVIS: As you always do.

02:42:51.542 --> 02:42:52.492
LIAM: It's got plenty of people around,

02:42:52.492 --> 02:42:54.249
so that means I can Sneak Attack him.

02:42:54.249 --> 02:42:57.101
MATT: As you rush past, before you attack?

02:42:57.101 --> 02:42:58.745
This duergar that was right by you,

02:42:58.745 --> 02:43:00.799
that has currently grown to a larger size

02:43:00.799 --> 02:43:01.863
gets a free swing at you.

02:43:01.863 --> 02:43:03.055
LIAM: Ain't no thing.

02:43:03.055 --> 02:43:05.382
MATT: That's going to be a 21 to hit.

02:43:05.382 --> 02:43:06.500
LIAM: Okay, that hits.

02:43:06.500 --> 02:43:09.833
MATT: All right, with its war pike it takes--

02:43:10.737 --> 02:43:13.843
deals 14 points of damage to you.

02:43:13.843 --> 02:43:16.313
LIAM: Who cares, I'm saving
my gnome friend, okay.

02:43:16.313 --> 02:43:17.146
Here I go.

02:43:18.932 --> 02:43:21.432
14, it's a 25 to hit his butt.

02:43:22.369 --> 02:43:23.202
MATT: 25 hits.

02:43:24.310 --> 02:43:26.388
LIAM: This is my keen dagger, with vorpal blade,

02:43:26.388 --> 02:43:29.252
two plus seven is nine, that's just nine.

02:43:29.252 --> 02:43:31.266
Where's a pencil, that's a pencil.

02:43:31.266 --> 02:43:33.149
And then we add my Sneak Attack damage,

02:43:33.149 --> 02:43:35.149
which is six, seven, ten.

02:43:38.158 --> 02:43:38.991
15.

02:43:39.967 --> 02:43:41.717
21, plus nine, is 30.

02:43:44.557 --> 02:43:46.499
MATT: All right, nice.

02:43:46.499 --> 02:43:47.401
LIAM: To the butt.

02:43:47.401 --> 02:43:48.402
Specifically to the butt.

02:43:48.402 --> 02:43:49.286
MATT: As you rush up,

02:43:49.286 --> 02:43:51.099
you take a moment as it's thrashing about,

02:43:51.099 --> 02:43:53.679
and you can see what looks, anatomy-wise,

02:43:53.679 --> 02:43:55.721
to be probably where it
expels whatever it eats.

02:43:55.721 --> 02:43:57.055
LIAM: The hole? Right in there.

02:43:57.055 --> 02:43:59.708
MATT: You go ahead and just
slash and eviscerate there.

02:43:59.708 --> 02:44:01.045
LIAM: How do you like me now?

02:44:01.045 --> 02:44:02.858
MATT: Even back there it's heavily armored,

02:44:02.858 --> 02:44:06.079
it takes, you carve through, and it--

02:44:06.079 --> 02:44:08.542
You've definitely left a lasting
impression on this bulette.

02:44:08.542 --> 02:44:09.375
LIAM: Pucker up, baby, pucker up.

02:44:09.375 --> 02:44:10.695
SAM: Hashtag, armored anus.

02:44:10.695 --> 02:44:13.470
(all laugh)

02:44:13.470 --> 02:44:15.005
TRAVIS: What, what, in the butt.

02:44:15.005 --> 02:44:17.689
LIAM: This is D&amp;amp;D in 2015, people, 2015.

02:44:17.689 --> 02:44:18.730
So that's the first attack, right?

02:44:18.730 --> 02:44:19.731
Now I get a second attack?

02:44:19.731 --> 02:44:21.014
MATT: The general also, by the way,

02:44:21.014 --> 02:44:23.703
appears as the
concentration spell was lost

02:44:23.703 --> 02:44:24.871
as you were unconscious.

02:44:24.871 --> 02:44:27.608
SAM: I must have stopped
concentrating for some reason.

02:44:27.608 --> 02:44:30.187
MATT: However, it is right
in front of, it's like.

02:44:32.177 --> 02:44:33.728
It's now in his face.

02:44:33.728 --> 02:44:35.061
LIAM: Second attack.

02:44:36.799 --> 02:44:37.823
22.

02:44:37.823 --> 02:44:39.411
MATT: That hits.

02:44:39.411 --> 02:44:41.581
Okay, and that's a four plus ten,

02:44:41.581 --> 02:44:45.164
ten points of fire-based
damage to the butt.

02:44:46.083 --> 02:44:47.042
MATT: All right.

02:44:47.042 --> 02:44:49.292
(all laugh)

02:44:50.432 --> 02:44:51.765
TRAVIS: Preparation H?

02:44:53.123 --> 02:44:55.606
Fire damage to the anus.

02:44:55.606 --> 02:44:58.023
MATT: That brings us to his turn.

02:44:59.548 --> 02:45:00.381
LAURA: The general's?

02:45:00.381 --> 02:45:02.523
MATT: The general's turn, who now
is there from the bulette,

02:45:02.523 --> 02:45:04.751
sees it, looks over and sees you.

02:45:04.751 --> 02:45:06.044
TRAVIS: It's right in front of him!

02:45:06.044 --> 02:45:09.271
MATT: Kind of sitting there
with your bloody hand.

02:45:09.271 --> 02:45:13.466
It's still flaming, swings
back, and goes for your head.

02:45:13.466 --> 02:45:14.692
TALIESIN: God.

02:45:14.692 --> 02:45:17.460
MATT: That is a 23 versus armor class.

02:45:17.460 --> 02:45:19.793
TALIESIN: Ah, yeah, that's gonna hit.

02:45:21.936 --> 02:45:22.935
Armor class sucks.

02:45:22.935 --> 02:45:23.982
MATT: Plus the fire damage.

02:45:23.982 --> 02:45:25.217
ASHLEY: What are you at?

02:45:25.217 --> 02:45:26.282
TALIESIN: I'm at

02:45:26.282 --> 02:45:27.532
39 I wanna say?

02:45:29.429 --> 02:45:32.103
MATT: Well, you take 31 points of damage.

02:45:32.103 --> 02:45:33.902
Including the fire damage from the pike,

02:45:33.902 --> 02:45:36.330
it goes for its second attack against you.

02:45:36.330 --> 02:45:37.263
TRAVIS: This thing sucks.

02:45:37.263 --> 02:45:39.863
MATT: That's gonna be a 22 versus armor class.

02:45:39.863 --> 02:45:41.052
TALIESIN: That's gonna hit.

02:45:41.052 --> 02:45:42.210
LIAM: It's a tank.

02:45:42.210 --> 02:45:43.043
TRAVIS: One.

02:45:43.043 --> 02:45:44.126
MATT: You take...

02:45:46.280 --> 02:45:48.223
That's gonna be 21 points of damage.

02:45:48.223 --> 02:45:49.165
TALIESIN: I'm out.

02:45:49.165 --> 02:45:53.165
Okay, Percy being pummeled
and pummeled again.

02:45:54.093 --> 02:45:55.926
Loses, your gun falls from your hand,

02:45:55.926 --> 02:45:58.265
as you slump to the ground,
your eyes roll back,

02:45:58.265 --> 02:45:59.853
unconsciousness and darkness.

02:45:59.853 --> 02:46:00.686
SAM: We're droppin' like flies!

02:46:00.686 --> 02:46:01.942
MATT: Taking you.

02:46:01.942 --> 02:46:03.773
That brings us to--

02:46:03.773 --> 02:46:05.736
ASHLEY: Everybody knows shit's fucked.

02:46:05.736 --> 02:46:06.569
MATT: Grog.

02:46:06.569 --> 02:46:08.641
TRAVIS: What, me? Bah!

02:46:08.641 --> 02:46:10.197
How tall is the thing?

02:46:10.197 --> 02:46:13.844
MATT: Tall? I'd say it's probably about...

02:46:13.844 --> 02:46:16.549
20 feet tall? 15, 20 feet tall?

02:46:16.549 --> 02:46:18.307
TRAVIS: Can I climb up on its back?

02:46:18.307 --> 02:46:21.189
MATT: It's not your size, it'd be really, really

02:46:21.189 --> 02:46:22.389
tight, pinning in there.

02:46:22.389 --> 02:46:24.143
TRAVIS: I would like to run up to its right side

02:46:24.143 --> 02:46:25.581
and flank it.

02:46:25.581 --> 02:46:26.851
MATT: Over here?

02:46:26.851 --> 02:46:27.750
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:46:27.750 --> 02:46:29.417
MATT: So you run around.

02:46:31.958 --> 02:46:33.869
Which you can do, 'cause
you're a freaking barbarian.

02:46:33.869 --> 02:46:35.683
TRAVIS: (snarls)

02:46:35.683 --> 02:46:36.971
MATT: All right, go ahead, you're
making your attacks.

02:46:36.971 --> 02:46:39.355
Go for it, three strikes against it.

02:46:39.355 --> 02:46:40.188
TRAVIS: 21.

02:46:41.106 --> 02:46:41.939
Hits, right?

02:46:41.939 --> 02:46:43.332
MATT: 21 definitely hits.

02:46:43.332 --> 02:46:44.568
TRAVIS: 16 plus eight, hits.

02:46:44.568 --> 02:46:45.873
MATT: Definitely hits.

02:46:45.873 --> 02:46:46.963
TRAVIS: Natural 20!

02:46:46.963 --> 02:46:49.219
(all cheer)

02:46:49.219 --> 02:46:50.491
TRAVIS: Does that mean I get extra?

02:46:50.491 --> 02:46:51.730
LIAM: Double damage, it means double damage.

02:46:51.730 --> 02:46:52.997
TRAVIS: Oh, double damage, okay.

02:46:52.997 --> 02:46:54.059
MATT: So first strike.

02:46:54.059 --> 02:46:56.178
ASHLEY: Kill him, kill him, kill him!

02:46:59.562 --> 02:47:00.871
TRAVIS: 16?

02:47:00.871 --> 02:47:02.371
MATT: 16 damage?
TRAVIS: Yes.

02:47:04.292 --> 02:47:05.204
LAURA: 21.

02:47:05.204 --> 02:47:06.444
TRAVIS: 21, thank you.

02:47:06.444 --> 02:47:07.978
LIAM: Stay in school, kids.

02:47:07.978 --> 02:47:08.967
TRAVIS: Stay on the table.

02:47:08.967 --> 02:47:11.723
MATT: It's the critical now,
so double the dice roll.

02:47:11.723 --> 02:47:13.473
TRAVIS: 20, thank you, and.

02:47:15.169 --> 02:47:16.669
15, plus that, 20.

02:47:18.254 --> 02:47:20.731
MATT: You double the dice,
then add the modifier.

02:47:20.731 --> 02:47:22.071
TRAVIS: Oh, double the second one.

02:47:22.071 --> 02:47:24.027
LAURA: So that's 40 on the last one.

02:47:24.027 --> 02:47:24.920
SAM: Jesus.

02:47:24.920 --> 02:47:25.920
LAURA: So 61, 76.
MATT: How do you want to do this, Grog?

02:47:27.771 --> 02:47:30.021
(all cheer)

02:47:31.080 --> 02:47:31.913
ASHLEY: Oh, you killed him?

02:47:31.913 --> 02:47:32.982
LIAM: Yes!

02:47:32.982 --> 02:47:34.333
MATT: How you wanna do this, Grog?

02:47:34.333 --> 02:47:37.286
TRAVIS: I would like to chop
down into the fleshy bit,

02:47:37.286 --> 02:47:38.544
and after I've sliced--

02:47:38.544 --> 02:47:39.892
MATT: The fleshy bit is on the
opposite side, by the way.

02:47:39.892 --> 02:47:41.691
So you're now at an unarmored side.

02:47:41.691 --> 02:47:43.612
However, it's still holding
Scanlan in its mouth,

02:47:43.612 --> 02:47:45.648
shaking him around, so,
how do you wanna finish it?

02:47:45.648 --> 02:47:48.154
TRAVIS: Can I get to its mouth at all?

02:47:48.154 --> 02:47:49.361
MATT: I could say for the flavor of this,

02:47:49.361 --> 02:47:51.460
yeah, you manage to just
barely make it over here.

02:47:51.460 --> 02:47:52.518
TRAVIS: I would like to swing through

02:47:52.518 --> 02:47:53.861
and catch the corner of its mouth,

02:47:53.861 --> 02:47:56.359
open its mouth wide, and
then I'd like to reach in,

02:47:56.359 --> 02:47:59.640
and with my teeth, pull its
fucking tongue out of its head,

02:47:59.640 --> 02:48:01.607
and start thrashing it side to side.

02:48:01.607 --> 02:48:02.655
(all laugh)

02:48:02.655 --> 02:48:04.937
MATT: First you rush up with your ax,

02:48:04.937 --> 02:48:07.584
using all of the aggression,
you take it and swing it,

02:48:07.584 --> 02:48:10.251
barely leaving you with a shave.

02:48:11.114 --> 02:48:12.449
You gash the side of its mouth,

02:48:12.449 --> 02:48:14.292
and draw this giant wound open.

02:48:14.292 --> 02:48:15.886
As it does, you actually snap,

02:48:15.886 --> 02:48:18.414
and cut through the tendons
that clench the jaw,

02:48:18.414 --> 02:48:19.720
causing it to fall open and slack.

02:48:19.720 --> 02:48:21.030
Scanlan spills out of its mouth,

02:48:21.030 --> 02:48:22.664
hitting the ground with a dull thud.

02:48:22.664 --> 02:48:25.215
As its mouth is now open,
it kind of rears back.

02:48:25.215 --> 02:48:26.320
You shake your head angrily,

02:48:26.320 --> 02:48:28.681
as the froth is gathering at
the corners of your mouth.

02:48:28.681 --> 02:48:32.259
You drop your ax from
one hand, grab the jaw,

02:48:32.259 --> 02:48:35.945
reach in, bite down on
its giant meaty tongue.

02:48:35.945 --> 02:48:37.365
Using your hand at the back of it,

02:48:37.365 --> 02:48:39.777
you pull and yank and you feel the muscle

02:48:39.777 --> 02:48:42.264
tearing and tensing before,
eventually it comes free,

02:48:42.264 --> 02:48:45.236
and is now dangling about 25, 30 pounds,

02:48:45.236 --> 02:48:47.736
of very very wet, tongue meat.

02:48:50.327 --> 02:48:51.929
With your third attack,
how do you finish it?

02:48:51.929 --> 02:48:54.088
(all laugh)

02:48:54.088 --> 02:48:56.538
TRAVIS: What do you after you're biting
its tongue in your mouth?

02:48:56.538 --> 02:48:57.393
MATT: That's what I'm asking.

02:48:57.393 --> 02:48:58.349
TRAVIS: That's a good point.

02:48:58.349 --> 02:48:59.227
MATT: It's looking really rough,

02:48:59.227 --> 02:49:00.741
but you still need to get
that final death blow.

02:49:00.741 --> 02:49:01.963
What are you doing with this, Grog?

02:49:01.963 --> 02:49:02.871
ASHLEY: Rip him apart.

02:49:02.871 --> 02:49:05.383
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'm gonna King Kong his jaw.

02:49:05.383 --> 02:49:07.195
I'm gonna take the broken
part, the top of his head,

02:49:07.195 --> 02:49:09.050
and just pull apart.

02:49:09.050 --> 02:49:11.512
MATT: Okay, so you drop your ax entirely,

02:49:11.512 --> 02:49:13.522
the tongue still dangling from your mouth.

02:49:13.522 --> 02:49:16.415
You reach and put one foot up
into the bottom of the jaw,

02:49:16.415 --> 02:49:18.438
using your other hands you push and push,

02:49:18.438 --> 02:49:20.521
you hear it crack, and pull,

02:49:20.521 --> 02:49:22.018
as it tenses and is trying to push down.

02:49:22.018 --> 02:49:24.187
It has no tension because
the jaw was destroyed.

02:49:24.187 --> 02:49:26.867
You pull back and hear a sickening snap,

02:49:26.867 --> 02:49:28.763
as the armor plate buckles underneath

02:49:28.763 --> 02:49:31.184
where the neck joint would
be on such a creature.

02:49:31.184 --> 02:49:33.095
Its eyes kinda roll back for a second,

02:49:33.095 --> 02:49:34.671
and it begins to slacken.

02:49:34.671 --> 02:49:36.309
As it does, you reach up with your fist,

02:49:36.309 --> 02:49:39.098
and penetrate the bottom of
where its brain would be.

02:49:39.098 --> 02:49:41.654
With a sickening (suction) sound,

02:49:41.654 --> 02:49:44.500
it goes entirely limp and
collapses on the ground.

02:49:44.500 --> 02:49:46.229
LIAM: And that's why you're on the team.

02:49:46.229 --> 02:49:48.236
(all cheer)

02:49:48.236 --> 02:49:49.191
TRAVIS: And as it falls,

02:49:49.191 --> 02:49:51.070
the tongue that's hanging in my mouth,

02:49:51.070 --> 02:49:53.540
I look to one of the
dwarves that's left, I go,

02:49:53.540 --> 02:49:55.122
who's next?

02:49:55.122 --> 02:49:56.613
(all laugh)

02:49:56.613 --> 02:49:57.702
MATT: We're gonna end it there for the night.

02:49:57.702 --> 02:49:59.952
(all groan)

02:50:02.500 --> 02:50:04.073
MATT: Damn guys, well done.

02:50:04.073 --> 02:50:05.147
TALIESIN: I'm sleeping.

02:50:05.147 --> 02:50:07.860
SAM: Oh, Percy's dead, hashtag save Percy.

02:50:07.860 --> 02:50:10.351
LAURA: I want more chicken.

02:50:10.351 --> 02:50:11.583
MATT: Before we finish, I'd say go ahead

02:50:11.583 --> 02:50:12.729
and throw a heal up on him.

02:50:12.729 --> 02:50:13.571
MARISHA: Oh yeah.

02:50:13.571 --> 02:50:14.832
TALIESIN: Thank you.

02:50:14.832 --> 02:50:15.832
ASHLEY: Good plan.

02:50:18.056 --> 02:50:19.588
MATT: It's nasty, man.

02:50:19.588 --> 02:50:21.717
You guys picked that, by the way.

02:50:21.717 --> 02:50:23.772
LAURA: Oh seriously?
TRAVIS: They did?

02:50:23.772 --> 02:50:24.635
You dicks!

02:50:24.635 --> 02:50:25.552
TALIESIN: You suck.

02:50:26.888 --> 02:50:28.251
ZAC: That was the chat room.

02:50:28.251 --> 02:50:29.915
ORION: Try harder next time.

02:50:29.915 --> 02:50:31.487
MATT: We'll be doing more of
those as time goes on.

02:50:31.487 --> 02:50:32.320
Not all the time,

02:50:32.320 --> 02:50:33.983
but whenever I have the
opportunity to put it in there,

02:50:33.983 --> 02:50:35.072
I'm gonna start asking for you guys

02:50:35.072 --> 02:50:37.583
to help me figure out what
to throw at these adventurers.

02:50:37.583 --> 02:50:38.817
LIAM: You sadists.

02:50:38.817 --> 02:50:40.107
(all laugh)

02:50:40.107 --> 02:50:41.006
ZAC: We shouldn't tell them the other options,
should we,

02:50:41.006 --> 02:50:43.077
just in case we wanna save them.

02:50:43.077 --> 02:50:45.392
MATT: Oh no, they'll come back in, don't worry.

02:50:45.392 --> 02:50:46.225
ASHLEY: 25.

02:50:46.225 --> 02:50:48.121
TALIESIN: Oh wow, I feel much better.

02:50:48.121 --> 02:50:51.642
ZAC: So you guys, we're gonna
be doing a Q and A.

02:50:51.642 --> 02:50:53.396
MATT: Yeah, for anyone who wants to stay over.

02:50:53.396 --> 02:50:54.451
ZAC: Anyone who wants to stick around,

02:50:54.451 --> 02:50:57.342
the audience has a ton of
questions for you guys.

02:50:57.342 --> 02:51:00.051
For the audience, it's a sub-only Q and A,

02:51:00.051 --> 02:51:02.955
so if you're been wondering
whether or not you should sub,

02:51:02.955 --> 02:51:05.008
let me give you some reasons why.

02:51:05.008 --> 02:51:07.645
Number one, you can ask
these guys questions

02:51:07.645 --> 02:51:08.827
in a little bit.

02:51:08.827 --> 02:51:10.167
Number two, every 50 subs,

02:51:10.167 --> 02:51:12.918
we're giving away tabletop promo kits

02:51:12.918 --> 02:51:17.062
that are like $250 worth of special stuff,

02:51:17.062 --> 02:51:19.347
and we will ship that internationally,

02:51:19.347 --> 02:51:20.180
doesn't matter.

02:51:20.180 --> 02:51:21.337
Even in Antarctica.

02:51:21.337 --> 02:51:23.718
We want someone in Antarctica
to do tabletop day,

02:51:23.718 --> 02:51:25.445
do you know anyone?

02:51:25.445 --> 02:51:26.278
MATT: I don't.

02:51:27.608 --> 02:51:29.835
ZAC: We had someone last year.

02:51:29.835 --> 02:51:31.284
MATT: Well shit, we gotta reach out then.

02:51:31.284 --> 02:51:33.606
ZAC: They're gone, they were
like the only people there,

02:51:33.606 --> 02:51:34.439
and they're gone.

02:51:34.439 --> 02:51:36.637
MATT: There's nobody there left,
they were the last bastion.

02:51:36.637 --> 02:51:38.300
Well, somebody needs to move to Antarctica

02:51:38.300 --> 02:51:40.336
in the next few days and let us know,

02:51:40.336 --> 02:51:41.400
so then we can totally use that.

02:51:41.400 --> 02:51:44.470
ZAC: We also do a Minecraft
server, for subs only,

02:51:44.470 --> 02:51:45.471
but if you want in on that,

02:51:45.471 --> 02:51:47.810
there's no automated message
for that server info,

02:51:47.810 --> 02:51:51.299
so just make sure and message
the Geek &amp;amp; Sundry account,

02:51:51.299 --> 02:51:54.376
and we'll get you that sub IP address

02:51:54.376 --> 02:51:55.991
for the Minecraft server.

02:51:55.991 --> 02:51:58.619
I know we have more,
there's lots more stuff.

02:51:58.619 --> 02:52:01.599
We do some other sub-only
chats throughout the week.

02:52:01.599 --> 02:52:03.725
lots of emotes, other fun stuff.

02:52:03.725 --> 02:52:05.691
But we're gonna go ahead
and roll some videos

02:52:05.691 --> 02:52:08.008
while we get set up for the Q and A.

02:52:08.008 --> 02:52:09.291
This was a lot of fun, oh!

02:52:09.291 --> 02:52:12.459
I would like to challenge
you guys to do a quick

02:52:12.459 --> 02:52:14.796
little donation drive for the charity

02:52:14.796 --> 02:52:16.125
that you guys support.

02:52:16.125 --> 02:52:17.625
MATT: Yeah, for 826LA.

02:52:18.543 --> 02:52:19.922
Had it going up in the chat room,

02:52:19.922 --> 02:52:20.806
if you have the opportunity,

02:52:20.806 --> 02:52:22.878
you wanna help support these children

02:52:22.878 --> 02:52:25.961
getting side educations and tutoring.

02:52:28.641 --> 02:52:30.881
ZAC: You guys
wanna tell them about,

02:52:30.881 --> 02:52:32.503
just to get them psyched up for it?

02:52:32.503 --> 02:52:34.024
'Cause we can get that command going.

02:52:34.024 --> 02:52:36.916
MARISHA: Yeah, 826LA, they're a
non-profit organization

02:52:36.916 --> 02:52:40.037
that helps primarily with literacy

02:52:40.037 --> 02:52:42.767
and creative story children for children

02:52:42.767 --> 02:52:45.850
between the ages of like five and 18.

02:52:46.915 --> 02:52:50.498
They have a really
great young authors book

02:52:51.939 --> 02:52:53.234
that you can buy that's a collection

02:52:53.234 --> 02:52:54.566
of all of the kids' book,

02:52:54.566 --> 02:52:57.992
and you can also go and check
out the time travel mart,

02:52:57.992 --> 02:52:59.293
there's one in Echo Park and then

02:52:59.293 --> 02:53:01.245
there's also one in Marina Del Rey.

02:53:01.245 --> 02:53:03.232
But you should just google 826,

02:53:03.232 --> 02:53:05.076
'cause I know there's one in Seattle,

02:53:05.076 --> 02:53:06.680
I know there's one in like Atlanta.

02:53:06.680 --> 02:53:08.837
New York, San Francisco.

02:53:08.837 --> 02:53:11.014
There might be an 826 in your city.

02:53:11.014 --> 02:53:12.550
LIAM: 826LA probably, right?

02:53:12.550 --> 02:53:15.800
MARISHA: 826LA is who we're raising money for.

02:53:17.605 --> 02:53:19.823
But yeah all of the 826 store fronts

02:53:19.823 --> 02:53:22.122
are a little bit different,
depending on where you go.

02:53:22.122 --> 02:53:23.160
They're super cool.

02:53:23.160 --> 02:53:25.042
MATT: Guys, please, check it out, it's awesome.

02:53:25.042 --> 02:53:28.046
It's a good group of people,
what they do is fantastic.

02:53:28.046 --> 02:53:29.706
If you have the opportunity please do,

02:53:29.706 --> 02:53:31.248
go ahead and donate to the charity.

02:53:31.248 --> 02:53:33.033
MATT: Well, thank you guys so much for tuning in

02:53:33.033 --> 02:53:34.774
for the fourth episode of Critical Role,

02:53:34.774 --> 02:53:36.531
with the grand return of Pike, our cleric.

02:53:36.531 --> 02:53:38.662
(all laugh)

02:53:38.662 --> 02:53:39.791
MATT: Necessary.

02:53:39.791 --> 02:53:40.624
Glad to have you back,

02:53:40.624 --> 02:53:42.761
I'm sure everyone here is
glad to have the healer back.

02:53:42.761 --> 02:53:44.633
LAURA: Especially today.

02:53:44.633 --> 02:53:46.671
TALIESIN: Very happy today.

02:53:46.671 --> 02:53:49.772
MATT: And a surprise return of Laura, so.

02:53:49.772 --> 02:53:51.173
LAURA: What a time to join the game.

02:53:51.173 --> 02:53:52.161
MATT: Heck yeah.

02:53:52.161 --> 02:53:53.567
All right guys, well, we're
gonna take a little bit

02:53:53.567 --> 02:53:54.630
to set up for the Q and A.

02:53:54.630 --> 02:53:56.294
Those who can stay, feel free to,

02:53:56.294 --> 02:53:57.320
those who can't, totally understand.

02:53:57.320 --> 02:53:58.937
We have kids and families to get to.

02:53:58.937 --> 02:54:00.266
Those who can will be here for the Q and A

02:54:00.266 --> 02:54:01.381
for the next hour or so.

02:54:01.381 --> 02:54:02.214
ZAC: One more thing,

02:54:02.214 --> 02:54:05.111
just so they know we're following through.

02:54:05.111 --> 02:54:08.062
We have the picture for you guys to sign.

02:54:08.062 --> 02:54:12.468
So Niareth won this, when
we reached 1,000 subs,

02:54:12.468 --> 02:54:14.618
so I think Pike is all
that's left for that.

02:54:14.618 --> 02:54:16.312
MATT: Pike is left to sign
this Player's Handbook.

02:54:16.312 --> 02:54:17.145
SAM: I haven't signed it.

02:54:17.145 --> 02:54:19.995
ZAC: And then we've got the picture.

02:54:19.995 --> 02:54:23.822
So we'll pass that around
while we're doing the set up.

02:54:23.822 --> 02:54:25.687
MATT: Do any of you have the gold marker?

02:54:25.687 --> 02:54:26.645
ZAC: I'll find it.

02:54:26.645 --> 02:54:27.478
MATT: All right, cool.

02:54:27.478 --> 02:54:28.548
Yeah guys we're gonna go
ahead and set up for this,

02:54:28.548 --> 02:54:30.110
we'll see you in a little
bit for the Q and A,

02:54:30.110 --> 02:54:32.114
thank you everyone for watching.

02:54:32.114 --> 02:54:32.947
Thanks guys.

02:54:32.947 --> 02:54:34.247
Awesome day at Critical Role, thanks.

02:54:34.247 --> 02:54:35.080
ASHLEY: Bye!

02:54:36.542 --> 02:54:38.726
WIL: Hey nerds, I'm Wil Wheaton, I know right?

02:54:38.726 --> 02:54:39.578
And guess what?

02:54:39.578 --> 02:54:40.481
It is back.

02:54:40.481 --> 02:54:43.119
International Tabletop Day has returned,

02:54:43.119 --> 02:54:45.797
this year on April 11th.

02:54:45.797 --> 02:54:46.779
What is that, you say?

02:54:46.779 --> 02:54:48.376
What is Tabletop Day?

02:54:48.376 --> 02:54:51.292
Well, if you don't
know, then shame on you.

02:54:51.292 --> 02:54:54.202
International Tabletop Day
is a worldwide celebration

02:54:54.202 --> 02:54:56.901
dedicated to the tabletop games we love

02:54:56.901 --> 02:54:59.183
to play with the people we love.

02:54:59.183 --> 02:55:01.036
People we like, people
we've never even met before,

02:55:01.036 --> 02:55:01.869
it doesn't matter,

02:55:01.869 --> 02:55:04.016
last year we had over
3,000 registered events

02:55:04.016 --> 02:55:07.227
across seven continents
and over 80 countries,

02:55:07.227 --> 02:55:08.242
that is amazing!

02:55:08.242 --> 02:55:12.045
But this year we're going
to make it even bigger.

02:55:12.045 --> 02:55:14.348
"Will Wheaton, how can
we make it even bigger

02:55:14.348 --> 02:55:15.375
"than last year?"

02:55:15.375 --> 02:55:16.375
That's what she said.

02:55:16.375 --> 02:55:17.208
Start now.

02:55:17.208 --> 02:55:20.562
Trend #TabletopDay on Twitter,
because that was awesome.

02:55:20.562 --> 02:55:23.269
Broadcast your plans on the internet,

02:55:23.269 --> 02:55:25.928
make a video, share
pictures, start a blog,

02:55:25.928 --> 02:55:29.083
create a dating profile for
other sexy gamers in your area,

02:55:29.083 --> 02:55:30.861
whatever you want.

02:55:30.861 --> 02:55:33.858
Celebrate it in your own way,
but we wanna hear from you.

02:55:33.858 --> 02:55:35.627
Be sure to use #TabletopDay,

02:55:35.627 --> 02:55:37.452
or @TabletopDay to let us know.

02:55:37.452 --> 02:55:39.161
It is up to you, world.

02:55:39.161 --> 02:55:41.144

and check out some of our favorite games.

02:55:47.140 --> 02:55:49.354
We will be streaming our own live event,

02:55:49.354 --> 02:55:52.257
here in Los Angeles for you to watch.

02:55:52.257 --> 02:55:55.060
And there will be more on that soon.

02:55:55.060 --> 02:55:57.891
You love tabletop games, and we love you,

02:55:57.891 --> 02:56:00.940
so join us in the global celebration,

02:56:00.940 --> 02:56:02.190
on April 11th.

02:56:03.113 --> 02:56:04.446
Play more games.

02:56:05.951 --> 02:56:07.252
Hey everybody, I'm Wil Wheaton,

02:56:07.252 --> 02:56:09.101
and I am coming to you semi-live

02:56:09.101 --> 02:56:12.187
from the Twitch TV set here
at the Geek &amp;amp; Sundry stages

02:56:12.187 --> 02:56:14.181
in beautiful downtown Burbank, California.

02:56:14.181 --> 02:56:17.444
I am here to tell you
everything you ever wanted

02:56:17.444 --> 02:56:19.982
to know about Tabletop's RPG show,

02:56:19.982 --> 02:56:22.475
coming this June, but were afraid to ask.

02:56:22.475 --> 02:56:24.135
Or have been asking for close to a year

02:56:24.135 --> 02:56:24.968
and I've been saying,

02:56:24.968 --> 02:56:27.488
"We'll tell you at some
point in the future."

02:56:27.488 --> 02:56:30.983
You can consider this
the big announcement.

02:56:30.983 --> 02:56:33.694
It was incredibly difficult
to cast this show.

02:56:33.694 --> 02:56:35.716
We needed people who were very comfortable

02:56:35.716 --> 02:56:39.010
improvising, who had experience
playing role playing games,

02:56:39.010 --> 02:56:42.374
and who were available when
we planned to shoot the show.

02:56:42.374 --> 02:56:45.311
It was surprisingly difficult
to get a pool of people

02:56:45.311 --> 02:56:47.885
who fit all of those criteria,

02:56:47.885 --> 02:56:50.470
and choose the most awesome among them.

02:56:50.470 --> 02:56:55.044
So your cast playing in
this wonderful show are:

02:56:55.044 --> 02:56:58.544
Yuri Lowenthal, Laura Bailey, Hank Green,

02:56:59.643 --> 02:57:01.338
and Alison Haislip.

02:57:01.338 --> 02:57:03.277
I'm really excited to have
these people all together.

02:57:03.277 --> 02:57:04.638
They're all my friends,

02:57:04.638 --> 02:57:06.856
they are all wonderful storytellers,

02:57:06.856 --> 02:57:10.271
and they are going to
be a tremendous party

02:57:10.271 --> 02:57:11.596
of adventurers.

02:57:11.596 --> 02:57:14.584
I'm only gonna try to
kill them a little bit.

02:57:14.584 --> 02:57:16.034
The most frequently asked question

02:57:16.034 --> 02:57:17.739
since I announced that
there was going to be

02:57:17.739 --> 02:57:20.629
a Tabletop RPG show is, hey Wil Wheaton!

02:57:20.629 --> 02:57:22.468
Why are you so awesome?

02:57:22.468 --> 02:57:24.574
The second most frequently
asked question is,

02:57:24.574 --> 02:57:28.324
what system are you
using to power this game?

02:57:29.162 --> 02:57:30.226
First and foremost,

02:57:30.226 --> 02:57:31.779
I needed a system that
was going to support

02:57:31.779 --> 02:57:34.119
the way I play roleplaying games,

02:57:34.119 --> 02:57:37.820
and that is telling a
story collaboratively

02:57:37.820 --> 02:57:40.532
with a group of players with me as the GM.

02:57:40.532 --> 02:57:42.491
I looked at some very well known systems

02:57:42.491 --> 02:57:44.971
like Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons,
and Savage Worlds,

02:57:44.971 --> 02:57:48.327
I looked at systems that
I love, like Fate Core,

02:57:48.327 --> 02:57:52.494
and I even looked at the
True 20, a d20 modern system.

02:57:53.329 --> 02:57:55.156
And I really wanted to use something

02:57:55.156 --> 02:57:58.019
that was released by an
independent publisher.

02:57:58.019 --> 02:58:01.818
I wanted to bring
something to the forefront

02:58:01.818 --> 02:58:04.714
of the roleplaying world
that maybe not as many

02:58:04.714 --> 02:58:08.335
people are familiar with
as I want them to be.

02:58:08.335 --> 02:58:09.919
But I wanna play the way that I played

02:58:09.919 --> 02:58:12.239
when I was falling in love
with roleplaying games

02:58:12.239 --> 02:58:13.127
when I was a kid.

02:58:13.127 --> 02:58:14.975
I wanna be able to sit around on a couch

02:58:14.975 --> 02:58:16.368
and some chairs with my friends,

02:58:16.368 --> 02:58:19.110
not have to worry about a map
on a table in front of us,

02:58:19.110 --> 02:58:21.659
and just work together
to use our imaginations

02:58:21.659 --> 02:58:22.687
to tell a story.

02:58:22.687 --> 02:58:24.621
But there's a system that I really love

02:58:24.621 --> 02:58:27.213
that's elegant, it's easy to learn,

02:58:27.213 --> 02:58:30.299
it's easy to teach, it's
very easy to understand,

02:58:30.299 --> 02:58:33.989
and it really just gets out of the way

02:58:33.989 --> 02:58:36.688
when you want to tell a story together.

02:58:36.688 --> 02:58:39.002
And that is the Adventure Game Engine

02:58:39.002 --> 02:58:41.335
that Green Ronin Publishing used

02:58:41.335 --> 02:58:44.652
to drive the Dragon Age
tabletop roleplaying game.

02:58:44.652 --> 02:58:47.408
I asked the developer three years ago

02:58:47.408 --> 02:58:49.325
to please make generic,

02:58:50.160 --> 02:58:52.453
so that we can build a
setting and put on top of it.

02:58:52.453 --> 02:58:54.599
They said actually this is
something we really wanna do.

02:58:54.599 --> 02:58:56.193
And it's come together.

02:58:56.193 --> 02:58:58.955
We have been able to work
together with Green Ronin

02:58:58.955 --> 02:59:02.066
to develop the fantasy
Adventure Game Engine.

02:59:02.066 --> 02:59:04.122
This is gonna take a lot
of the things you know

02:59:04.122 --> 02:59:05.718
from the Dragon Age RPG,

02:59:05.718 --> 02:59:09.476
and put it all together
to support our world,

02:59:09.476 --> 02:59:12.809
which I have had the best time creating.

02:59:14.309 --> 02:59:18.476
I sat down three months ago
with some amazing writers,

02:59:20.154 --> 02:59:23.635
and just started brainstorming
about what kind of world

02:59:23.635 --> 02:59:25.318
we wanted to explore.

02:59:25.318 --> 02:59:27.965
But what I kept coming back to is,

02:59:27.965 --> 02:59:31.548
I love science fiction,
and I love fantasy.

02:59:32.606 --> 02:59:34.844
Why not put them together?

02:59:34.844 --> 02:59:38.598
Why not build a world that is inspired by

02:59:38.598 --> 02:59:40.848
the 1978 Heavy Metal movie,

02:59:42.575 --> 02:59:46.658
and 1980's amazing Saturday
morning cartoon show,

02:59:47.676 --> 02:59:49.831
Thundarr the Barbarian.

02:59:49.831 --> 02:59:51.786
I thought it would be great for characters

02:59:51.786 --> 02:59:54.800
to encounter goblinoid kind of creatures,

02:59:54.800 --> 02:59:56.735
and instead of them using crossbows,

02:59:56.735 --> 02:59:58.412
they're using laser rifles.

02:59:58.412 --> 03:00:00.076
I've got it all worked out,

03:00:00.076 --> 03:00:02.737
we have a huge team of writers
that put all this together

03:00:02.737 --> 03:00:04.218
that built an amazing codex

03:00:04.218 --> 03:00:07.394
that gave terrific logic to all of these

03:00:07.394 --> 03:00:09.928
decisions that we made.

03:00:09.928 --> 03:00:11.381
We're not gonna tell you what they are.

03:00:11.381 --> 03:00:13.361
You may discover some of
them during the course

03:00:13.361 --> 03:00:14.831
of the season.

03:00:14.831 --> 03:00:17.989
So what is the name of
this incredible world?

03:00:17.989 --> 03:00:22.985
The title of our show is
Titansgrave: The Ashes of Valkana.

03:00:22.985 --> 03:00:24.720
You can sort of come
up with your own ideas

03:00:24.720 --> 03:00:26.938
about what those words mean.

03:00:26.938 --> 03:00:28.401
I know, but I'm not telling.

03:00:28.401 --> 03:00:31.884
'Cause that's not how the Wheaton talks.

03:00:31.884 --> 03:00:34.176
Titansgrave: The Ashes of Valkana

03:00:34.176 --> 03:00:37.694
will premiere right here
at Geekandsundry.com

03:00:37.694 --> 03:00:38.694
on June 2nd.

03:00:39.758 --> 03:00:41.875
For those of you not in America,

03:00:41.875 --> 03:00:44.062
Titansgrave: The Ashes of Valkana

03:00:44.062 --> 03:00:47.298
will premiere right here on Geek &amp;amp; Sundry

03:00:47.298 --> 03:00:48.783
on two June.

03:00:48.783 --> 03:00:51.861
So I hope that you're as
excited about this as I am,

03:00:51.861 --> 03:00:53.295
and I hope that you will tune in,

03:00:53.295 --> 03:00:55.539
and then watch us for ten straight weeks

03:00:55.539 --> 03:00:57.728
of incredible high
adventure story telling,

03:00:57.728 --> 03:01:00.202
and until then, play more games.

03:01:00.202 --> 03:01:02.319
IVAN: Hey guys, Ivan here, the
host of Game the Game,

03:01:02.319 --> 03:01:04.199
on Geek &amp;amp; Sundry's new Twitch channel.

03:01:04.199 --> 03:01:06.202
I'm here with Becca, Ify, and Hector,

03:01:06.202 --> 03:01:08.880
to get you excited about
International Tabletop Day.

03:01:08.880 --> 03:01:10.171
So International Tabletop Day

03:01:10.171 --> 03:01:11.699
is going to be on April 11th,

03:01:11.699 --> 03:01:13.692
and all of our friends
at AEG have brought us

03:01:13.692 --> 03:01:15.725
an amazing edition of Love Letter

03:01:15.725 --> 03:01:17.342
in order to play with you today.

03:01:17.342 --> 03:01:19.205
That's right nerds.

03:01:19.205 --> 03:01:21.419
It's Batman Love Letter.

03:01:21.419 --> 03:01:23.494
Now Batman Love Letter is a game of logic,

03:01:23.494 --> 03:01:24.799
deduction, and risk,

03:01:24.799 --> 03:01:27.037
in which you try to capture or hold

03:01:27.037 --> 03:01:29.052
the highest value card in your hand

03:01:29.052 --> 03:01:30.442
by the end of the rounds.

03:01:30.442 --> 03:01:32.355
In the meantime we'll all be playing cards

03:01:32.355 --> 03:01:34.022
in order to eliminate each other.

03:01:34.022 --> 03:01:36.352
But whoever has the highest-value card

03:01:36.352 --> 03:01:39.405
at the end of the round will win a token.

03:01:39.405 --> 03:01:42.600
So who will be the greatest
detective in all of Gotham?

03:01:42.600 --> 03:01:43.679
It's gonna be Batman.

03:01:43.679 --> 03:01:46.871
BECCA: Oh, no, no, no, no, no,
it'll be Poison Ivy.

03:01:46.871 --> 03:01:50.382
IFY: You guys both are wrong,
it's going to be Bane.

03:01:50.382 --> 03:01:52.428
HECTOR: It's probably not gonna be Robin.

03:01:52.428 --> 03:01:54.084
(all laugh)

03:01:54.084 --> 03:01:56.537
IVAN: Now, normally we will
play until seven tokens,

03:01:56.537 --> 03:01:58.171
but for the purposes of this video,

03:01:58.171 --> 03:01:59.751
we'll play until three.

03:01:59.751 --> 03:02:01.610
Whoever gets three is gonna win.

03:02:01.610 --> 03:02:03.200
Let's play.

03:02:03.200 --> 03:02:05.726
Pass out your cards Becca, one to each.

03:02:05.726 --> 03:02:06.559
BECCA: Burn the first?

03:02:06.559 --> 03:02:08.144
IVAN: Burn the first.

03:02:08.144 --> 03:02:10.343
You have to burn a card
before you even begin,

03:02:10.343 --> 03:02:12.213
because there is a mystery card

03:02:12.213 --> 03:02:13.962
that isn't in play normally.

03:02:13.962 --> 03:02:15.809
So keep that in mind when you're playing.

03:02:15.809 --> 03:02:17.441
HECTOR: Burning a card, who are we playing with?

03:02:17.441 --> 03:02:18.858
The Batman villain Firefly?

03:02:18.858 --> 03:02:20.179
(all laugh)

03:02:20.179 --> 03:02:22.248
IFY: Leave the jokes to me, Robin.

03:02:22.248 --> 03:02:23.282
HECTOR: All right, fine.

03:02:23.282 --> 03:02:26.595
IFY: Just so you know, I'm doing
a set at the comedy store,

03:02:26.595 --> 03:02:29.518
and I need three friends to show up.

03:02:29.518 --> 03:02:30.632
HECTOR: What night is it?

03:02:30.632 --> 03:02:31.596
I'm busy that night.

03:02:31.596 --> 03:02:34.351
IFY: I didn't even give you the time yet.

03:02:34.351 --> 03:02:36.419
IVAN: Hector, why don't you go first?

03:02:36.419 --> 03:02:37.699
HECTOR: Robin.

03:02:37.699 --> 03:02:39.485
IVAN: Robin, the man wonder.

03:02:39.485 --> 03:02:41.068
HECTOR: Okay, here we go.

03:02:43.901 --> 03:02:45.651
I'm gonna play Robin.

03:02:48.074 --> 03:02:50.845
I've got protection for
my entire next round.

03:02:50.845 --> 03:02:51.678
IVAN: Right.

03:02:51.678 --> 03:02:53.344
So every single time you play a card,

03:02:53.344 --> 03:02:55.954
normally it has an action
that is attached to it.

03:02:55.954 --> 03:02:57.807
So I'm playing Catwoman,

03:02:57.807 --> 03:03:00.526
who allows me to look at
another player's hand.

03:03:00.526 --> 03:03:01.443
Poison Ivy?

03:03:03.827 --> 03:03:05.448
Noted.

03:03:05.448 --> 03:03:06.281
Now it's your turn.

03:03:06.281 --> 03:03:09.193
BECCA: It's my turn, so I draw a card.

03:03:09.193 --> 03:03:11.737
I'm gonna hang on to that one, maybe.

03:03:11.737 --> 03:03:13.544
And I also play Catwoman.

03:03:13.544 --> 03:03:16.627
And I'm going to look at Bane's hand.

03:03:18.415 --> 03:03:19.324
That's terrible.

03:03:19.324 --> 03:03:22.427
IFY: You make fun of me but
you lack the understanding

03:03:22.427 --> 03:03:23.677
of my strategy.

03:03:25.014 --> 03:03:27.163
I will play the Batman.

03:03:27.163 --> 03:03:30.144
I can't guess Robin's
because he has immunity,

03:03:30.144 --> 03:03:32.039
but I can guess Poison Ivy's.

03:03:32.039 --> 03:03:33.246
IVAN: If he can guess correctly,

03:03:33.246 --> 03:03:34.362
not only does he get a token,

03:03:34.362 --> 03:03:35.963
but she's eliminated from the round,

03:03:35.963 --> 03:03:37.939
and now there's only
three of us available.

03:03:37.939 --> 03:03:39.892
So it's one step closer to victory.

03:03:39.892 --> 03:03:41.183
What's your guess?

03:03:41.183 --> 03:03:43.345
IFY: My guess is Two-Face.

03:03:43.345 --> 03:03:44.897
BECCA: Incorrect.

03:03:44.897 --> 03:03:45.818
IVAN: Robin?

03:03:45.818 --> 03:03:47.175
HECTOR: Thanks, Batman.

03:03:47.175 --> 03:03:48.842
All right, here we go.

03:03:50.998 --> 03:03:52.965
I'm also gonna play Batman.

03:03:52.965 --> 03:03:56.895
I'm gonna guess that Poison
Ivy has the Joker card.

03:03:56.895 --> 03:03:57.945
BECCA: Incorrect.

03:03:57.945 --> 03:03:58.936
HECTOR: Darn it.

03:03:58.936 --> 03:04:00.791
Jiminey Jillickers.

03:04:00.791 --> 03:04:03.539
BECCA: Now you have to do something
terribly embarrassing, right?

03:04:03.539 --> 03:04:04.468
Or is that just Half Scrolls?

03:04:04.468 --> 03:04:06.735
HECTOR: Like maybe wear a Robin
costume, cool, sounds good.

03:04:06.735 --> 03:04:08.482
Oh, already doing it, great.

03:04:08.482 --> 03:04:09.794
So great.

03:04:09.794 --> 03:04:13.502
IVAN: I have two cards and I'm going to

03:04:13.502 --> 03:04:15.553
also play the Batman.

03:04:15.553 --> 03:04:17.332
You've been picked on a lot, Poison Ivy.

03:04:17.332 --> 03:04:18.904
BECCA: I've been picked on so much.

03:04:18.904 --> 03:04:21.524
IVAN: You played a Batman.

03:04:21.524 --> 03:04:22.596
HECTOR: Get him Batman.

03:04:22.596 --> 03:04:24.331
IVAN: I'm gonna guess you've got a Poison Ivy.

03:04:24.331 --> 03:04:25.498
IFY: You're wrong!

03:04:25.498 --> 03:04:27.214
IVAN: (groans)

03:04:27.214 --> 03:04:28.607
IFY: No survivors!

03:04:28.607 --> 03:04:30.086
IVAN: (laughs)

03:04:30.086 --> 03:04:32.649
All right, I'm done, go ahead, Poison Ivy.

03:04:32.649 --> 03:04:34.790
BECCA: If anyone's wondering
why so many Batman cards

03:04:34.790 --> 03:04:36.752
are being drawn, it's because
there are five in the deck.

03:04:36.752 --> 03:04:39.371
There's either one or two
of all the other characters.

03:04:39.371 --> 03:04:43.288
So I draw, and I will
play, myself, Poison Ivy.

03:04:46.052 --> 03:04:47.302
This card says,

03:04:48.190 --> 03:04:50.423
choose any player including yourself

03:04:50.423 --> 03:04:53.775
to discard his or her
hand, and draw a new card.

03:04:53.775 --> 03:04:55.560
Ivan, you look pretty confident.

03:04:55.560 --> 03:04:56.474
Discard.

03:04:56.474 --> 03:04:57.307
IVAN: Discard, all right.

03:04:57.307 --> 03:04:58.140
BECCA: And draw a new hand.

03:04:58.140 --> 03:04:58.973
IVAN: Had a Two-Face.

03:04:59.819 --> 03:05:01.614
IFY: It's time for me to draw.

03:05:01.614 --> 03:05:03.168
IVAN: I have a hard time thinking that we're

03:05:03.168 --> 03:05:05.327
gonna get anything out
of you in that mask.

03:05:05.327 --> 03:05:06.981
IFY: Oh, you'll see.

03:05:06.981 --> 03:05:08.538
BECCA: I'm sorry, what?

03:05:08.538 --> 03:05:09.482
IFY: You'll see.

03:05:09.482 --> 03:05:10.380
BECCA: What did he say?

03:05:10.380 --> 03:05:11.731
IVAN: I think it's something about seals?

03:05:11.731 --> 03:05:14.068
BECCA: Did you need help opening a seal?

03:05:14.068 --> 03:05:17.304
IFY: I'll play the Batman, and
I will guess Becca again,

03:05:17.304 --> 03:05:19.636
she has the Harley Quinn.

03:05:19.636 --> 03:05:20.636
BECCA: Incorrect.

03:05:22.312 --> 03:05:23.621
HECTOR: Geez, we're terrible at this game.

03:05:23.621 --> 03:05:25.333
IVAN: We're really, really bad.

03:05:25.333 --> 03:05:26.289
BECCA: I'm great at it.

03:05:26.289 --> 03:05:28.854
IFY: Sooner or later.

03:05:28.854 --> 03:05:30.984
IVAN: He's in there, or he's there.

03:05:30.984 --> 03:05:32.521
Not there, there.

03:05:32.521 --> 03:05:33.599
Not there, there.

03:05:33.599 --> 03:05:34.449
BECCA: There?
IVAN: There.

03:05:34.449 --> 03:05:35.282
BECCA: Where?

03:05:35.282 --> 03:05:38.992
HECTOR: I'm going to play my own version of Bane.

03:05:38.992 --> 03:05:40.748
That was terrible.

03:05:40.748 --> 03:05:42.325
BECCA: You don't have the mask.

03:05:42.325 --> 03:05:45.000
HECTOR: Myself and another player
can secretly compare hands,

03:05:45.000 --> 03:05:47.453
and whichever hand is lowest is out.

03:05:47.453 --> 03:05:49.373
So I'm gunning for you, Poison Ivy.

03:05:49.373 --> 03:05:50.550
Because you kissed me that one time,

03:05:50.550 --> 03:05:53.362
and then you didn't wanna
hang out with me afterwards,

03:05:53.362 --> 03:05:54.795
like that was really mean, so.

03:05:54.795 --> 03:05:56.435
BECCA: I had ulterior motives.

03:05:56.435 --> 03:06:00.002
IVAN: I'm not looking, Batman's not looking.

03:06:00.002 --> 03:06:01.362
BECCA: I'm out of the game.

03:06:01.362 --> 03:06:02.606
HECTOR: You're out, yes!

03:06:02.606 --> 03:06:04.905
BECCA: I had myself again.

03:06:04.905 --> 03:06:06.637
IVAN: Which means you have a
higher numbered card.

03:06:06.637 --> 03:06:07.731
HECTOR: Yes, that is correct.

03:06:07.731 --> 03:06:08.810
IVAN: Higher than five.

03:06:08.810 --> 03:06:10.919
HECTOR: Good detective work, Batman.

03:06:10.919 --> 03:06:13.428
Real genius, this one.

03:06:13.428 --> 03:06:14.542
IVAN: All right.

03:06:14.542 --> 03:06:16.008
This is the last card of the deck,

03:06:16.008 --> 03:06:20.148
which means after this, whoever
has the highest card, wins.

03:06:20.148 --> 03:06:22.105
HECTOR: Duh, Batman, we know, God.

03:06:22.105 --> 03:06:24.215
IVAN: I'm playing Robin, Robin.

03:06:24.215 --> 03:06:25.125
All right?

03:06:25.125 --> 03:06:27.013
BECCA: That makes me think he has the Joker.

03:06:27.013 --> 03:06:28.602
IVAN: Well, we'll find out won't we?

03:06:28.602 --> 03:06:29.968
What do you got?

03:06:29.968 --> 03:06:31.218
IFY: I had myself.

03:06:32.389 --> 03:06:34.225
HECTOR: Boom, Harley Quinn beats Bane.

03:06:34.225 --> 03:06:37.274
IVAN: And the Joker beats Harley Quinn.

03:06:37.274 --> 03:06:38.133
HECTOR: Darn it.

03:06:38.133 --> 03:06:39.822
IVAN: I got you, Joker.

03:06:39.822 --> 03:06:41.059
BECCA: Take your token.

03:06:41.059 --> 03:06:43.372
IVAN: I will take my narcissistic token

03:06:43.372 --> 03:06:45.119
that has my symbol on it.

03:06:45.119 --> 03:06:47.185
HECTOR: This is just what Batman
needed, an ego boost.

03:06:47.185 --> 03:06:49.766
Batman needed an ego boost, great.

03:06:49.766 --> 03:06:50.754
IFY: Robin.

03:06:50.754 --> 03:06:52.527
BECCA: The deb chef, the deb chef.

03:06:52.527 --> 03:06:54.791
HECTOR: You seem to live with a multi billionaire,

03:06:54.791 --> 03:06:57.130
yet can't afford contacts.

03:06:57.130 --> 03:06:58.898
What's the deal with that?

03:06:58.898 --> 03:07:00.648
BECCA: No burn card, no burn card.

03:07:00.648 --> 03:07:01.481
IVAN: Oh, great.

03:07:01.481 --> 03:07:04.802
So since I won the last
round, I get to play first,

03:07:04.802 --> 03:07:07.102
because I am the greatest detective.

03:07:07.102 --> 03:07:09.439
And I got a Catwoman,

03:07:09.439 --> 03:07:13.321
which means I think I'm
interested in Bane's hand.

03:07:13.321 --> 03:07:14.906
Whatcha got, Bane?

03:07:14.906 --> 03:07:17.392
You got crap, is what he's got.

03:07:17.392 --> 03:07:19.471
BECCA: Choose any player including yourself

03:07:19.471 --> 03:07:22.597
to discard his or her
hand and draw a new card.

03:07:22.597 --> 03:07:24.011
Hector, burn your card.

03:07:24.011 --> 03:07:25.322
HECTOR: You got it, but it's Robin,

03:07:25.322 --> 03:07:26.918
and I'm not gonna tell you again.

03:07:26.918 --> 03:07:30.270
All right, I had Batman, which is cool,

03:07:30.270 --> 03:07:32.850
because he's the least
value card in the game,

03:07:32.850 --> 03:07:33.810
so that's just gonna help me out,

03:07:33.810 --> 03:07:35.561
so I'm just gonna grab a new card.

03:07:35.561 --> 03:07:37.679
IFY: All right, I'm going to draw.

03:07:37.679 --> 03:07:38.679
Draw a card.

03:07:39.525 --> 03:07:42.311
Oof, oof, oof, such a good card.

03:07:42.311 --> 03:07:45.363
IVAN: Who are you gonna use it on, Bane?

03:07:45.363 --> 03:07:46.743
BECCA: It's probably Batman.

03:07:46.743 --> 03:07:49.645
IFY: I'm gonna do a Batman card.

03:07:49.645 --> 03:07:51.572
Robin, do you have Poison Ivy?

03:07:51.572 --> 03:07:54.155
HECTOR: (laughs) No.

03:07:55.468 --> 03:07:57.249
IFY: My turn is over.

03:07:57.249 --> 03:07:59.768
HECTOR: All right, it's my turn.

03:07:59.768 --> 03:08:01.798
Dick Grayson and Jason Todd, Tim Drake,

03:08:01.798 --> 03:08:05.199
Stephanie Brown, Carrie
Kelley, John Blake, help me.

03:08:05.199 --> 03:08:06.611
Okay, here we go.

03:08:06.611 --> 03:08:09.459
My girl Selina Kyle, Catwoman, bam.

03:08:09.459 --> 03:08:12.126
And I wanna look at Bane's hand.

03:08:13.033 --> 03:08:14.419
Show me back here buddy,
show me back here,

03:08:14.419 --> 03:08:15.365
whatcha got?

03:08:15.365 --> 03:08:16.234
IFY: Got this.

03:08:16.234 --> 03:08:17.391
HECTOR: Okay, good to know.

03:08:17.391 --> 03:08:18.487
IVAN: All right.

03:08:18.487 --> 03:08:22.145
I'm going to just play my ward Robin.

03:08:22.145 --> 03:08:23.046
HECTOR: You're welcome.

03:08:23.046 --> 03:08:24.713
IVAN: Grant me immunity.

03:08:27.706 --> 03:08:28.830
BECCA: Batman.

03:08:28.830 --> 03:08:31.678
I'm gonna guess that Bane has Poison Ivy.

03:08:31.678 --> 03:08:32.928
IFY: You're wrong!

03:08:34.063 --> 03:08:36.646
BECCA: You'll never have Poison Ivy.

03:08:37.500 --> 03:08:39.167
IFY: I'll use Catwoman.

03:08:40.256 --> 03:08:42.651
BECCA: To look at another player's hands.

03:08:42.651 --> 03:08:44.151
HECTOR: Pause for error.

03:08:45.777 --> 03:08:47.994
IFY: I will look at

03:08:47.994 --> 03:08:49.494
Poison Ivy's hand.

03:08:51.026 --> 03:08:54.583
HECTOR: Don't do it Bane, don't fall
into that venus fly trap.

03:08:54.583 --> 03:08:56.586
Get it, 'cause it's a trap, 'cause it's.

03:08:56.586 --> 03:08:57.419
It's a plant based pun.

03:08:57.419 --> 03:08:58.336
IVAN: Good job.

03:08:59.519 --> 03:09:01.091
IFY: Ah.

03:09:01.091 --> 03:09:01.924
IVAN: There it is.

03:09:01.924 --> 03:09:03.183
IFY: Ah.

03:09:03.183 --> 03:09:04.016
Ah!

03:09:05.228 --> 03:09:07.380
IVAN: Robin, Robin go ahead.

03:09:07.380 --> 03:09:09.672
HECTOR: Okay, here we go.

03:09:09.672 --> 03:09:10.856
IVAN: What's it gonna be?

03:09:10.856 --> 03:09:13.426
HECTOR: I'm gonna play Batman.

03:09:13.426 --> 03:09:15.960
And I'm gonna guess that Bane

03:09:15.960 --> 03:09:17.460
Has a Batman card.

03:09:18.547 --> 03:09:20.019
IFY: You are wrong.

03:09:20.019 --> 03:09:22.520
IVAN: For once he doesn't have a Batman card.

03:09:22.520 --> 03:09:25.687
IFY: I want to point out to the watchers.

03:09:27.009 --> 03:09:29.414
Hector looked at my hand.

03:09:29.414 --> 03:09:30.595
HECTOR: Oh I did, that's true.

03:09:30.595 --> 03:09:33.161
IFY: And saw me play the card.

03:09:33.161 --> 03:09:36.661
He knew exactly which card was in my hand.

03:09:37.722 --> 03:09:39.805
And chose the wrong card.

03:09:40.842 --> 03:09:44.682
IVAN: This is why you're the boy
wonder, and not Batman.

03:09:44.682 --> 03:09:45.772
HECTOR: I'd like to point out,

03:09:45.772 --> 03:09:48.454
that my chest has made
me very uncomfortable,

03:09:48.454 --> 03:09:50.602
and I'm clearly out of my element,

03:09:50.602 --> 03:09:52.779
and dressing me up as Robin
was a good call everybody,

03:09:52.779 --> 03:09:54.259
good call everyone.

03:09:54.259 --> 03:09:56.096
Good call guys.

03:09:56.096 --> 03:09:56.929
Wow.

03:09:56.929 --> 03:09:59.829
IFY: I really thought that
was game over for me.

03:09:59.829 --> 03:10:01.420
I was wrong.

03:10:02.684 --> 03:10:04.055
HECTOR: Oh my God.

03:10:04.055 --> 03:10:08.222
Your annoying voice has
really gotten into my head.

03:10:09.569 --> 03:10:11.902
BECCA: That's his greatest power.

03:10:13.207 --> 03:10:15.203
IVAN: I also have the Batman.

03:10:15.203 --> 03:10:18.844
So we know he doesn't have a
Batman, you know what it is.

03:10:18.844 --> 03:10:20.107
Thanks Robin.

03:10:20.107 --> 03:10:21.137
Useless.

03:10:21.137 --> 03:10:24.970
So I'm gonna guess that
Bane has Harley Quinn.

03:10:27.480 --> 03:10:28.840
IFY: You are wrong!

03:10:28.840 --> 03:10:30.067
IVAN: Damn.

03:10:30.067 --> 03:10:30.917
I tried.

03:10:30.917 --> 03:10:35.711
All the clues are there,
just one missing element.

03:10:35.711 --> 03:10:39.310
BECCA: I played Batman, I'm going
to guess that Bane has

03:10:39.310 --> 03:10:40.624
Two-Face.

03:10:40.624 --> 03:10:43.431
IFY: You are wrong as well.

03:10:43.431 --> 03:10:46.089
IVAN: He has the Joker then, or something.

03:10:46.089 --> 03:10:49.384
How can you throw that many
Batmans at a single man,

03:10:49.384 --> 03:10:51.060
and not get what he's got in his hand.

03:10:51.060 --> 03:10:52.780
HECTOR: He really did break you, he really did.

03:10:57.164 --> 03:10:59.342
And now I'm Nightwing, great,
that's how long that took.

03:10:59.342 --> 03:11:00.925
IFY: I'm going to say.

03:11:01.954 --> 03:11:05.378
Two-Face can trade hands with Becca.

03:11:05.378 --> 03:11:07.378
BECCA: (sighs)

03:11:08.471 --> 03:11:10.304
IVAN: That's where it was.

03:11:12.820 --> 03:11:13.710
Robin?

03:11:13.710 --> 03:11:14.960
HECTOR: It's my turn.

03:11:16.478 --> 03:11:17.895
IVAN: Diddly fingers.

03:11:18.840 --> 03:11:20.500
HECTOR: You guys think you're gonna win this?

03:11:20.500 --> 03:11:21.795
You don't know Dick.

03:11:21.795 --> 03:11:23.780
Greyson, because that's my real name.

03:11:23.780 --> 03:11:25.619
I'm gonna play

03:11:25.619 --> 03:11:26.507
Bane.

03:11:26.507 --> 03:11:27.533
BECCA: Bane-in it up.

03:11:27.533 --> 03:11:30.089
IVAN: What's up, who's gonna compare?

03:11:30.089 --> 03:11:32.564
HECTOR: It's gonna be you, Batman.

03:11:32.564 --> 03:11:33.863
Let's see what you got, old chum.

03:11:33.863 --> 03:11:35.483
Oh hoh, bye, you're out.

03:11:35.483 --> 03:11:36.690
(laughs)

03:11:36.690 --> 03:11:38.190
IVAN: Batman card, so.

03:11:39.350 --> 03:11:40.198
Batman's out.

03:11:40.198 --> 03:11:41.977
BECCA: Batman's the worst.

03:11:41.977 --> 03:11:42.810
HECTOR: Oh my gosh.

03:11:42.810 --> 03:11:45.157
IVAN: How's it feel to knock a
man down from his tower?

03:11:45.157 --> 03:11:45.990
HECTOR: It feels great.

03:11:45.990 --> 03:11:46.823
IVAN: Right, okay.

03:11:46.823 --> 03:11:47.656
HECTOR: How's it feel for not giving me--

03:11:47.656 --> 03:11:50.144
MARISHA: Great for my back.

03:11:50.144 --> 03:11:50.977
ZAC: We're live.

03:11:50.977 --> 03:11:52.014
MATT: What's up everyone,

03:11:52.014 --> 03:11:53.994
we got this camera right
here in the middle, right?

03:11:53.994 --> 03:11:55.121
ASHLEY: Hello.

03:11:55.121 --> 03:11:55.954
LIAM: Oh, hi.

03:11:55.954 --> 03:11:57.403
MATT: Thank you guys for watching.

03:11:57.403 --> 03:11:58.743
Hope you enjoyed yourselves.

03:11:58.743 --> 03:12:01.039
These guys all being crazy players,

03:12:01.039 --> 03:12:02.579
and kicking ass,

03:12:02.579 --> 03:12:04.215
and occasionally getting
knocked unconscious,

03:12:04.215 --> 03:12:05.048
and nearly eaten.

03:12:05.048 --> 03:12:06.490
ZAC: Any mods want to put this in sub mode for us?

03:12:06.490 --> 03:12:08.092
Let's do sub mode.

03:12:08.092 --> 03:12:10.240
MARISHA: So you have to sub.

03:12:10.240 --> 03:12:12.083
Bye everybody who's not a sub.

03:12:12.083 --> 03:12:13.151
ASHLEY: Bye!

03:12:13.151 --> 03:12:13.984
ZAC: They can still watch,

03:12:13.984 --> 03:12:14.817
they just can't ask questions.

03:12:14.817 --> 03:12:15.650
ORION: Oh.

03:12:15.650 --> 03:12:16.483
Okay.

03:12:16.483 --> 03:12:19.198
MARISHA: Well, your word is not important.

03:12:19.198 --> 03:12:21.625
LIAM: Laura had to bugger out.

03:12:21.625 --> 03:12:23.749
ASHLEY: Wait, is that a little icon of you?

03:12:23.749 --> 03:12:24.582
MATT: Yeah.

03:12:24.582 --> 03:12:25.466
ASHLEY: What?

03:12:25.466 --> 03:12:26.749
ORION: Yeah, he's an emoji now.

03:12:26.749 --> 03:12:27.759
ASHLEY: You're an emoji?

03:12:27.759 --> 03:12:28.592
MATT: It's weird.

03:12:28.592 --> 03:12:29.425
TALIESIN: He's made it.

03:12:29.425 --> 03:12:30.634
ASHLEY: You've made it.

03:12:32.651 --> 03:12:33.875
MATT: All right, so how are we
doing the questions?

03:12:33.875 --> 03:12:35.165
Are we just picking as we go?

03:12:35.165 --> 03:12:37.211
ZAC: You can moderate yourselves.

03:12:37.211 --> 03:12:39.918
ASHLEY: Laura and Sam did leave.

03:12:39.918 --> 03:12:41.058
MATT: Unfortunately.

03:12:41.058 --> 03:12:44.759
ASHLEY: Laura had to go to a thing,
and Sam had to go to a thing.

03:12:44.759 --> 03:12:46.528
MATT: Sam's thing is kids.

03:12:46.528 --> 03:12:48.291
Sam has two kids.

03:12:48.291 --> 03:12:49.440
Liam has two kids, but he--

03:12:49.440 --> 03:12:50.273
ASHLEY: Hey look at--

03:12:51.458 --> 03:12:53.708
(all laugh)

03:12:54.655 --> 03:12:55.966
MATT: I am so sorry, everyone.

03:12:55.966 --> 03:12:58.719
LIAM: I mean he's pretty good at
Dungeon Mastering, right?

03:12:58.719 --> 03:13:00.306
ASHLEY: Yeah, he's pretty good.

03:13:00.306 --> 03:13:02.375
ORION: Someone asked what alignment we are.

03:13:02.375 --> 03:13:04.996
First question, what
alignment are our characters?

03:13:04.996 --> 03:13:06.012
MARISHA: We're all good.

03:13:06.012 --> 03:13:06.999
LIAM: Chaotic good.

03:13:06.999 --> 03:13:07.832
ASHLEY: Chaotic good.

03:13:07.832 --> 03:13:09.764
ORION: Tiberius is chaotic good.

03:13:09.764 --> 03:13:11.510
TRAVIS: Chaotic neutral, bitches.

03:13:11.510 --> 03:13:13.044
LIAM: What was your first
roleplaying experience?

03:13:13.044 --> 03:13:15.266
I saw that go through.

03:13:15.266 --> 03:13:16.955
TALIESIN: GURPS in high school.

03:13:16.955 --> 03:13:18.122
ALL: GURPS.

03:13:18.973 --> 03:13:22.664
MATT: The second edition of Dungeons
&amp;amp; Dragons in high school.

03:13:22.664 --> 03:13:23.497
TRAVIS: This.

03:13:23.497 --> 03:13:24.782
ASHLEY: Was my first, yeah.

03:13:24.782 --> 03:13:26.202
LIAM: This guy just started.

03:13:26.202 --> 03:13:28.184
I did AD&amp;amp;D in high school,

03:13:28.184 --> 03:13:31.347
and I DM'ed while playing,
which is totally cheating.

03:13:31.347 --> 03:13:35.267
This is the first pure
experience I've had.

03:13:35.267 --> 03:13:38.017
ORION: This is my first campaign also.

03:13:39.156 --> 03:13:41.139
I was a Magic the Gathering fan.

03:13:41.139 --> 03:13:45.899
MARISHA: I actually had Matt as my
first DM, way before

03:13:45.899 --> 03:13:47.490
All this started.

03:13:47.490 --> 03:13:49.810
So I played a few other games, and then,

03:13:49.810 --> 03:13:52.384
now I'm back to the OG master.

03:13:52.384 --> 03:13:55.938
LIAM: I saw, when and how did you
all start playing together?

03:13:55.938 --> 03:13:58.452
The reason this started is because,

03:13:58.452 --> 03:14:01.898
I directed Matt as Leon
Kennedy in Resident Evil 6,

03:14:01.898 --> 03:14:04.159
and every time he came in he would say,

03:14:04.159 --> 03:14:06.533
"hey, you know, I'm running a game,

03:14:06.533 --> 03:14:08.055
"you can come in and just do a one off."

03:14:08.055 --> 03:14:09.072
And I was like, "oh, I got babies,

03:14:09.072 --> 03:14:12.129
"I can't do that, I can't
do that, I can't do that."

03:14:12.129 --> 03:14:15.341
And then finally once for
my birthday I thought,

03:14:15.341 --> 03:14:17.277
I can do a one off, it'll be
the only time we'll do it,

03:14:17.277 --> 03:14:18.833
just see how it goes.

03:14:18.833 --> 03:14:22.096
Scanlan and I did a podcast together,

03:14:22.096 --> 03:14:24.140
and every week we would do some new thing,

03:14:24.140 --> 03:14:26.743
and we're like fuck it, let's play D&amp;amp;D.

03:14:26.743 --> 03:14:29.043
We all did it and everybody got snake bit,

03:14:29.043 --> 03:14:31.532
and it's been the best
thing that ever happened.

03:14:31.532 --> 03:14:32.365
To me at least.

03:14:32.365 --> 03:14:33.749
ASHLEY: Yup.

03:14:33.749 --> 03:14:36.114
ORION: Our character alignments do matter

03:14:36.114 --> 03:14:38.676
on how we play the characters,
an earlier question.

03:14:38.676 --> 03:14:40.216
MATT: Yeah, they do definitely matter.

03:14:40.216 --> 03:14:42.281
A couple quick answers here.

03:14:42.281 --> 03:14:45.297
The conversion from
Pathfinder to Fifth Edition

03:14:45.297 --> 03:14:47.929
was decided because, as
we're going on to this show,

03:14:47.929 --> 03:14:50.730
and we had so many players,
combat tends to get bogged down,

03:14:50.730 --> 03:14:52.544
and a lot of floating
modifiers in Pathfinder.

03:14:52.544 --> 03:14:53.854
For large groups like this it's difficult

03:14:53.854 --> 03:14:55.398
to keep it flowing and moving.

03:14:55.398 --> 03:14:56.761
I felt once I had taken
a look at Fifth Edition,

03:14:56.761 --> 03:14:58.696
that the combat system was
a little more simplified,

03:14:58.696 --> 03:15:01.642
and a little easier to make
freeform and just roll with it.

03:15:01.642 --> 03:15:03.942
So that was a much better decision.

03:15:03.942 --> 03:15:06.026
Plus Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons
generally has a better

03:15:06.026 --> 03:15:07.595
name recognition than Pathfinder,

03:15:07.595 --> 03:15:09.189
so when you're putting a show out there,

03:15:09.189 --> 03:15:11.794
it's probably easier to do
with very minimal transition,

03:15:11.794 --> 03:15:12.989
it took a little bit of customizing,

03:15:12.989 --> 03:15:15.682
like for Percy's gunslinger.

03:15:15.682 --> 03:15:17.203
We just had to customize
it, we made it ourselves.

03:15:17.203 --> 03:15:18.069
We sat down.

03:15:18.069 --> 03:15:18.902
TALIESIN: Took a day.

03:15:18.902 --> 03:15:20.259
MATT: Took a day, and we worked out,

03:15:20.259 --> 03:15:21.092
some of the stuff we wanted to keep,

03:15:21.092 --> 03:15:22.163
some of the things that didn't break it,

03:15:22.163 --> 03:15:23.309
we wanted to make it interesting.

03:15:23.309 --> 03:15:26.759
It is a martial archetype
for the fighter class.

03:15:26.759 --> 03:15:30.250
So it does give the bonus
a fighter class does.

03:15:30.250 --> 03:15:31.456
Nothing is too overpowered about it,

03:15:31.456 --> 03:15:33.281
other than just having custom weapons,

03:15:33.281 --> 03:15:34.815
and some cool grit-based abilities

03:15:34.815 --> 03:15:37.419
that we kinda transferred
over from Pathfinder.

03:15:37.419 --> 03:15:38.252
It's interesting.

03:15:38.252 --> 03:15:41.592
It's a good challenge
to see how it works out.

03:15:41.592 --> 03:15:42.509
TALIESIN: It is, it's working out.

03:15:42.509 --> 03:15:43.421
I'm digging it.

03:15:43.421 --> 03:15:45.713
I keep reading and finding
things I'm not doing

03:15:45.713 --> 03:15:47.856
that could be more interesting, so.

03:15:47.856 --> 03:15:49.633
MATT: Keeping your hand and
firing into the mouth

03:15:49.633 --> 03:15:50.973
of a bulette is fun.

03:15:50.973 --> 03:15:52.705
TALIESIN: That felt great.

03:15:52.705 --> 03:15:56.164
LIAM: Travis, everybody's
asking about your shirt.

03:15:56.164 --> 03:15:57.442
TRAVIS: Oh.

03:15:57.442 --> 03:16:00.677
I think it's a website
called redbubble.com?

03:16:00.677 --> 03:16:03.064
I just googled Grog, and there was that.

03:16:03.064 --> 03:16:04.934
TALIESIN: Just google Grog.

03:16:04.934 --> 03:16:06.641
TRAVIS: I needed it right away.

03:16:09.458 --> 03:16:10.471
Right, right.

03:16:10.471 --> 03:16:12.139
LIAM: I'm also seeing, why did we switch

03:16:12.139 --> 03:16:14.326
from Pathfinder to Fifth Edition?

03:16:14.326 --> 03:16:16.072
MATT: I answered that a second ago.

03:16:16.072 --> 03:16:16.905
LIAM: Oh, you did?

03:16:16.905 --> 03:16:18.054
MATT: Yeah, the idea being that
the reason we switched

03:16:18.054 --> 03:16:19.657
was it was easier for large-scale combat,

03:16:19.657 --> 03:16:21.610
and the system was a
little more simplified,

03:16:21.610 --> 03:16:24.664
and I felt for such a large
party it'd be easier to do.

03:16:24.664 --> 03:16:26.188
Plus character creation
for any guests we have

03:16:26.188 --> 03:16:28.237
in the future, so that
was the main reason.

03:16:28.237 --> 03:16:30.676
I love Pathfinder, but
at this size, it's good.

03:16:30.676 --> 03:16:31.829
Answering your earlier question too,

03:16:31.829 --> 03:16:33.842
I saw someone ask, a good party size.

03:16:33.842 --> 03:16:38.616
Legitimately, my preference is
between four and six players.

03:16:38.616 --> 03:16:41.070
This works because
they're amazing players,

03:16:41.070 --> 03:16:43.255
and because we keep it very freeform,

03:16:43.255 --> 03:16:46.150
and not getting bogged
down in minutia too often.

03:16:46.150 --> 03:16:50.112
The four to six players I
think is a good sweet spot.

03:16:50.112 --> 03:16:52.006
MARISHA: I see, does Keyleth have limitations

03:16:52.006 --> 03:16:54.612
on what animals she can transform into?

03:16:54.612 --> 03:16:56.214
Yeah, for the most part
I can only transform

03:16:56.214 --> 03:16:58.220
into beasts and I have to be under

03:16:58.220 --> 03:17:00.138
a certain challenge rating.

03:17:00.138 --> 03:17:02.496
So right now, at my level, I
can only turn into beasts

03:17:02.496 --> 03:17:05.281
that are a challenge
reading of three or lower.

03:17:05.281 --> 03:17:06.380
MATT: A third of your druid level, right?

03:17:06.380 --> 03:17:10.355
MARISHA: Yeah, a third of my druid
level which is nine right now.

03:17:10.355 --> 03:17:12.745
But for the most part I can change into

03:17:12.745 --> 03:17:15.768
almost anything as long as
it's under a challenge rating

03:17:15.768 --> 03:17:17.183
of three.

03:17:17.183 --> 03:17:18.423
MATT: Pike, how do you feel about Scanlan?

03:17:18.423 --> 03:17:19.580
Do you return his affections?

03:17:19.580 --> 03:17:20.762
ASHLEY: Oh, well.

03:17:20.762 --> 03:17:22.742
I'm on the fence about him.

03:17:24.978 --> 03:17:27.516
He's really pretty
great, but I don't know.

03:17:27.516 --> 03:17:28.874
I'm not really sold yet.

03:17:28.874 --> 03:17:30.243
MARISHA: You know Pike, I feel
like we haven't actually

03:17:30.243 --> 03:17:31.538
girl talked about this.

03:17:31.538 --> 03:17:32.991
ASHLEY: I know, we never girl talked about it.

03:17:32.991 --> 03:17:33.824
MARISHA: We should.

03:17:33.824 --> 03:17:34.657
ASHLEY: I know, we should talk.

03:17:34.657 --> 03:17:38.638
I just, I really like him,
I think he's really funny.

03:17:38.638 --> 03:17:42.275
I really the fact that
he's a musician, but.

03:17:42.275 --> 03:17:43.108
MARISHA: That's hot.

03:17:43.108 --> 03:17:45.230
ASHLEY: I don't know, I'm not
really sold on him yet.

03:17:45.230 --> 03:17:47.001
MARISHA: I'm just concerned if
he could treat you well.

03:17:47.001 --> 03:17:48.753
ASHLEY: Oh no, you know what?

03:17:48.753 --> 03:17:50.586
MARISHA: He's got bad habits.

03:17:51.873 --> 03:17:54.238
ASHLEY: He likes to frequent brothels
and things like that,

03:17:54.238 --> 03:17:55.571
which, you know.

03:17:56.406 --> 03:17:58.156
I'd wanna give him his
freedom and his space.

03:17:58.156 --> 03:18:00.912
I don't know if I'm into it.

03:18:00.912 --> 03:18:02.344
TALIESIN: If I say it so you can understand it,

03:18:02.344 --> 03:18:03.256
what's the point?

03:18:05.474 --> 03:18:07.185
LIAM: Someone's asking if we like presents.

03:18:07.185 --> 03:18:09.754
I think we'd all like fan art.

03:18:09.754 --> 03:18:12.372
MATT: Fan art's awesome, we love it.

03:18:12.372 --> 03:18:15.899
LIAM: Immortalize our
shitheadedness, that'd be good.

03:18:15.899 --> 03:18:16.846
MARISHA: Oh, it's true.

03:18:16.846 --> 03:18:18.657
ASHLEY: Another couple people on there

03:18:18.657 --> 03:18:20.600
were asking about my ears.

03:18:20.600 --> 03:18:23.389
And I really like
supporting small businesses.

03:18:23.389 --> 03:18:28.179
And there's a store on Etsy
called Tiny Tangerines,

03:18:28.179 --> 03:18:30.953
and she makes these by hand.

03:18:30.953 --> 03:18:34.369
And makes like deer, and bears,

03:18:34.369 --> 03:18:35.364
she makes a ton of stuff.

03:18:35.364 --> 03:18:36.796
MATT: That's really cute.

03:18:36.796 --> 03:18:38.129
ASHLEY: Check her out.

03:18:39.314 --> 03:18:40.868
LIAM: We still got that little one.

03:18:40.868 --> 03:18:43.202
Socrates asked what was a favorite moment

03:18:43.202 --> 03:18:46.170
before we started streaming the show?

03:18:46.170 --> 03:18:49.183
Our first game was pretty amazing.

03:18:49.183 --> 03:18:50.266
MARISHA: Our first game was great,

03:18:50.266 --> 03:18:54.152
I've got some good memories from that one.

03:18:54.152 --> 03:18:57.636
LIAM: Most of us, I was giggling uncontrollably,

03:18:57.636 --> 03:18:59.605
I couldn't believe we were doing it.

03:18:59.605 --> 03:19:02.216
And just watching my friends,
who I work with all the time,

03:19:02.216 --> 03:19:04.473
just dropping into
character, there was no like,

03:19:04.473 --> 03:19:06.557
oh, let's see, what will
I do, what am I doing?

03:19:06.557 --> 03:19:08.282
I will move, I will roll.

03:19:08.282 --> 03:19:11.874
Like Bailey, Bailey dropped
into character from the get-go,

03:19:11.874 --> 03:19:13.291
and was a ringer.

03:19:14.255 --> 03:19:16.894
But the moment I was thinking
of was when Pike died.

03:19:16.894 --> 03:19:17.835
Pike died.

03:19:17.835 --> 03:19:18.668
MATT: Like died died.

03:19:18.668 --> 03:19:23.153
LIAM: Shortly before we switched
from private to public.

03:19:23.153 --> 03:19:24.326
It was emotional.

03:19:24.326 --> 03:19:26.903
A couple people started
crying, I teared up.

03:19:26.903 --> 03:19:29.652
We put two and a half years into this,

03:19:29.652 --> 03:19:31.872
and we're all very connected to it.

03:19:31.872 --> 03:19:33.319
I'm not gonna get into it,

03:19:33.319 --> 03:19:35.799
but I've had a hard couple
of years personally,

03:19:35.799 --> 03:19:38.482
everything's fine, but this
was like therapy for me.

03:19:38.482 --> 03:19:41.285
And to see one of my friends go down?

03:19:41.285 --> 03:19:42.446
ASHLEY: It was sad.

03:19:42.446 --> 03:19:43.382
LIAM: It was fucking emotional.

03:19:43.382 --> 03:19:44.732
MARISHA: I don't think a few people were crying,

03:19:44.732 --> 03:19:46.192
I think everyone was crying.

03:19:46.192 --> 03:19:47.025
ORION: I was crying.

03:19:47.025 --> 03:19:48.505
ASHLEY: I was definitely crying.

03:19:48.505 --> 03:19:50.597
I was like, "no, I love
doing this so much!"

03:19:50.597 --> 03:19:52.147
I don't wanna, I mean,

03:19:52.147 --> 03:19:53.754
when you spend that much time with people,

03:19:53.754 --> 03:19:56.106
over two and a half years,
you get so attached,

03:19:56.106 --> 03:19:57.823
and attached to characters.

03:19:57.823 --> 03:19:59.662
MARISHA: We know these characters almost as well

03:19:59.662 --> 03:20:01.601
as we know each other now.

03:20:01.601 --> 03:20:04.390
MATT: Factoids, the tower you made for us

03:20:04.390 --> 03:20:06.150
in Minecraft is awesome.

03:20:06.150 --> 03:20:08.003
Seriously, well done,
look at the pictures,

03:20:08.003 --> 03:20:09.591
it's great, we're gonna have
to actually go through it.

03:20:09.591 --> 03:20:10.554
MARISHA: Wait, we have a tower?

03:20:10.554 --> 03:20:12.770
MATT: A guy built an entire tower for the group.

03:20:12.770 --> 03:20:13.686
ASHLEY: No way!

03:20:13.686 --> 03:20:15.910
MARISHA: They built a castle Greyskull?

03:20:15.910 --> 03:20:19.417
MATT: Essentially, on the Geek
&amp;amp; Sundry Minecraft server.

03:20:21.787 --> 03:20:22.709
No.

03:20:22.709 --> 03:20:23.945
Wait no I did see that!

03:20:23.945 --> 03:20:24.778
It was huge.

03:20:24.778 --> 03:20:26.155
ZAC: It towers over the entire --

03:20:26.155 --> 03:20:26.988
LIAM: Of what?

03:20:26.988 --> 03:20:28.023
MATT: Of him!

03:20:28.023 --> 03:20:29.906
Someone made a sculpture of--.

03:20:29.906 --> 03:20:31.860
Did you make that or somebody else?

03:20:31.860 --> 03:20:32.761
You made that?

03:20:32.761 --> 03:20:33.594
ZAC: Oh no.

03:20:33.594 --> 03:20:36.099
MATT: Okay, somebody else made it for you.

03:20:36.099 --> 03:20:37.804
LIAM: Do we have $50 in the budget

03:20:37.804 --> 03:20:40.881
to go on eBay and get a
Castle of Greyskull set?

03:20:40.881 --> 03:20:42.037
Put it on the set somewhere?

03:20:42.037 --> 03:20:43.204
Let's do that.

03:20:44.328 --> 03:20:45.257
MATT: There we go.

03:20:45.257 --> 03:20:47.224
I see a couple quick questions.

03:20:47.224 --> 03:20:48.391
ORION: To answer your question,

03:20:48.391 --> 03:20:52.224
there is an origin of
Tiberius, fully written.

03:20:53.156 --> 03:20:54.351
I won't say it all right now,

03:20:54.351 --> 03:20:56.601
but he comes from a political family,

03:20:56.601 --> 03:20:58.718
and there's a whole
bunch of layers to him.

03:20:58.718 --> 03:21:01.218
He is a thought-out character.

03:21:02.740 --> 03:21:05.323
The buffoonery is half-planned.

03:21:07.258 --> 03:21:10.866
MARISHA: I mean, we're all really
deep, thought out characters.

03:21:10.866 --> 03:21:13.241
ORION: Well, they asked if I actually thought out

03:21:13.241 --> 03:21:14.357
a story for him.

03:21:14.357 --> 03:21:18.033
He does have a thing for
this character named Allura.

03:21:18.033 --> 03:21:19.119
MATT: Yeah, Arcanist Allura,

03:21:19.119 --> 03:21:21.266
the one that actually
sent them on this mission,

03:21:21.266 --> 03:21:22.859
he has kind of a thing for.

03:21:22.859 --> 03:21:23.906
ORION: She's super awesome.

03:21:23.906 --> 03:21:25.682
Hot, I think she's hot.

03:21:25.682 --> 03:21:26.597
MATT: She's pretty hot.

03:21:26.597 --> 03:21:27.597
ASHLEY: Super hot.

03:21:29.944 --> 03:21:31.004
MATT: The gunslinger class info,

03:21:31.004 --> 03:21:33.692
I actually posted on
Twitter a few days ago,

03:21:33.692 --> 03:21:36.141
it's in my dropbox if you
look through my Twitter.

03:21:36.141 --> 03:21:37.061
It's on there, otherwise,

03:21:37.061 --> 03:21:38.179
we'll probably put it up on the website,

03:21:38.179 --> 03:21:39.409
when all the website stuff is up there.

03:21:39.409 --> 03:21:41.530
I'm happy to release it now.

03:21:41.530 --> 03:21:43.699
It's pretty balanced, it's fun.

03:21:43.699 --> 03:21:44.802
Might have some tweaks down the road,

03:21:44.802 --> 03:21:46.470
depending on how things play out.

03:21:46.470 --> 03:21:48.163
You should go to my Twitter,
you'll find it there.

03:21:48.163 --> 03:21:50.365
TRAVIS: We're gonna have a website
with all our characters.

03:21:50.365 --> 03:21:51.698
LIAM: Yeah, we're working towards that.

03:21:51.698 --> 03:21:52.961
MATT: Working on it, yeah.

03:21:52.961 --> 03:21:55.354
Like a lot of things right
now, it's a work in progress.

03:21:56.618 --> 03:22:00.072
LIAM: Someone asked what kind of
food would everyone like?

03:22:00.072 --> 03:22:01.115
ORION: Ooh, like Thai food.

03:22:01.115 --> 03:22:01.948
LIAM: I like Indian.

03:22:01.948 --> 03:22:03.204
MATT: Ooh, Indian is good.

03:22:03.204 --> 03:22:04.430
ASHLEY: I really noticed--

03:22:04.430 --> 03:22:05.996
ZAC: Let them know not to order food.

03:22:05.996 --> 03:22:08.429
LIAM: Don't, that's a terrible idea.

03:22:08.429 --> 03:22:11.258
ORION: We just had a bunch of chicken.

03:22:11.258 --> 03:22:12.311
MARISHA: Oh you mean like right now?

03:22:12.311 --> 03:22:13.144
Yeah, don't do it right now.

03:22:13.144 --> 03:22:13.977
ZAC: If you tell them what you want,

03:22:13.977 --> 03:22:15.004
all of a sudden I'll get a call, like,

03:22:15.004 --> 03:22:16.216
"your food is on the way!"

03:22:16.216 --> 03:22:18.259
MARISHA: Yeah, no, not right now, maybe next week.

03:22:18.259 --> 03:22:20.255
TRAVIS: Matt, you're going
to Wizard World in Philly.

03:22:20.255 --> 03:22:21.412
But we will not be joining

03:22:21.412 --> 03:22:24.052
because we don't own a
private fucking plane.

03:22:24.052 --> 03:22:25.467
MARISHA: But I'll be there.

03:22:25.467 --> 03:22:26.951
Is anybody else gonna be there?

03:22:26.951 --> 03:22:28.917
TRAVIS: Oh really?

03:22:28.917 --> 03:22:29.750
MARISHA: We'll be there.

03:22:29.750 --> 03:22:31.693
LIAM: Somebody asked something, like,

03:22:31.693 --> 03:22:34.679
what do we hope is the
result of this show?

03:22:34.679 --> 03:22:36.504
I can't remember the wording.

03:22:36.504 --> 03:22:38.819
Obviously we're doing this
because we love each other

03:22:38.819 --> 03:22:41.536
and we're having fun
together, but I also hope,

03:22:41.536 --> 03:22:45.757
D&amp;amp;D has been, its entire
history has been like,

03:22:45.757 --> 03:22:47.711
"oh, it's this weird thing that guys do

03:22:47.711 --> 03:22:50.081
"with dice in a room."

03:22:50.081 --> 03:22:53.120
Anyone can do this, I love video games,

03:22:53.120 --> 03:22:56.886
I work in video games, but
D&amp;amp;D has changed my life.

03:22:56.886 --> 03:23:01.204
It is social, it is person
to person, it is real,

03:23:01.204 --> 03:23:04.103
because it's people in a
room doing shit together,

03:23:04.103 --> 03:23:06.359
and that's kind of lacking
a little bit in our world,

03:23:06.359 --> 03:23:08.068
and I would say find some friends.

03:23:08.068 --> 03:23:09.833
I mean, I love that there are sort of

03:23:09.833 --> 03:23:12.420
online tools to play with
people across the country,

03:23:12.420 --> 03:23:14.545
but if you can find three
or four people in your town

03:23:14.545 --> 03:23:16.712
to do this, I'd say do it.

03:23:17.757 --> 03:23:19.021
Do it.

03:23:19.021 --> 03:23:20.243
TRAVIS: Yeah, do it.

03:23:20.243 --> 03:23:22.396
MARISHA: There's something really
amazing about the fact

03:23:22.396 --> 03:23:24.835
that we're all essentially
kind of building

03:23:24.835 --> 03:23:28.162
and communally developing
a story together,

03:23:28.162 --> 03:23:30.913
and that's something that not a whole lot

03:23:30.913 --> 03:23:32.121
of things can grant you,

03:23:32.121 --> 03:23:36.121
and we don't really get
in today's society much.

03:23:38.096 --> 03:23:40.756
We're all kinda creating this as a thing.

03:23:40.756 --> 03:23:42.929
And I think it's good
that we're like, hey,

03:23:42.929 --> 03:23:45.034
this is socially acceptable.

03:23:45.034 --> 03:23:48.071
D&amp;amp;D's cool, everyone should play D&amp;amp;D.

03:23:48.071 --> 03:23:50.645
MATT: Actually, the IT Crowd episode of D&amp;amp;D

03:23:50.645 --> 03:23:52.771
is one of the best on camera examples

03:23:52.771 --> 03:23:54.084
of a D&amp;amp;D game night thing.

03:23:54.084 --> 03:23:55.230
ORION: That is an awesome episode.

03:23:55.230 --> 03:23:56.826
MATT: Fucking hilarious, and a great,

03:23:56.826 --> 03:23:59.769
truncated version of this
is kinda what the game is.

03:23:59.769 --> 03:24:01.490
So good on you.

03:24:01.490 --> 03:24:03.080
ORION: Cut to them weeping.

03:24:03.080 --> 03:24:04.088
TALIESIN: So many questions going so quickly.

03:24:04.088 --> 03:24:05.378
MATT: I know.

03:24:05.378 --> 03:24:07.333
ASHLEY: I want a Grog shirt that says "do it."

03:24:07.333 --> 03:24:09.626
TALIESIN: And the kitty shirts were an accident.

03:24:09.626 --> 03:24:10.980
This was not planned.

03:24:10.980 --> 03:24:11.813
MARISHA: Oh yeah, our kitty shirts.

03:24:11.813 --> 03:24:13.720
LIAM: Someone's saying what
edition to start with?

03:24:13.720 --> 03:24:15.239
I would start with the most recent,

03:24:15.239 --> 03:24:16.705
because you know they're
gonna keep updating

03:24:16.705 --> 03:24:17.843
it over the years.

03:24:17.843 --> 03:24:20.042
MATT: Fifth is great, Fifth
is a great entry point.

03:24:20.042 --> 03:24:20.875
LIAM: It's really loose.

03:24:20.875 --> 03:24:22.332
I feel like all of us felt like,

03:24:22.332 --> 03:24:25.386
we were doing Pathfinder, and...

03:24:25.386 --> 03:24:27.128
Fucking loved it, otherwise
we wouldn't be doing it,

03:24:27.128 --> 03:24:29.402
but it was really intricate,

03:24:29.402 --> 03:24:31.848
and we were doing it
every six or seven weeks,

03:24:31.848 --> 03:24:33.953
when we were off-air, so.

03:24:33.953 --> 03:24:35.792
We felt like the rules
were really complicated

03:24:35.792 --> 03:24:37.862
and we'd lose track of it.

03:24:37.862 --> 03:24:39.063
We loved doing it, obviously,

03:24:39.063 --> 03:24:42.646
but Fifth Edition is
really fast and loose.

03:24:44.356 --> 03:24:45.319
I recommend that.

03:24:45.319 --> 03:24:46.900
And Travis just stuck
his finger in my ear,

03:24:46.900 --> 03:24:48.483
he kinda does that.

03:24:49.655 --> 03:24:51.988
He hits me in the nads a lot.

03:24:53.275 --> 03:24:56.431
MATT: This is a homebrew campaign.

03:24:56.431 --> 03:24:58.956
I wrote it all just kind
of for the hell of it.

03:24:58.956 --> 03:25:02.502
Custom, don't really base
it on anything existing.

03:25:02.502 --> 03:25:03.710
I feel like I'm playing
more in that world,

03:25:03.710 --> 03:25:06.398
and I always hate the idea
of, in the middle of DMing,

03:25:06.398 --> 03:25:07.805
having to go to a module,

03:25:07.805 --> 03:25:10.163
or having to look for a
rule that wasn't my own.

03:25:10.163 --> 03:25:11.398
It feels more detached.

03:25:11.398 --> 03:25:12.318
There are modules that are great,

03:25:12.318 --> 03:25:13.266
and I've run great modules,

03:25:13.266 --> 03:25:15.104
but for me personally, with the pacing,

03:25:15.104 --> 03:25:17.345
and the flow of the game,
I prefer to do homebrew.

03:25:17.345 --> 03:25:20.492
LIAM: Connected to that, someone
asked, if you had any tips,

03:25:20.492 --> 03:25:21.782
and I'd like to know
the answer to this too,

03:25:21.782 --> 03:25:23.879
because I'm running a game
for my eight-year-old son

03:25:23.879 --> 03:25:25.959
and his friends who are about to start,

03:25:25.959 --> 03:25:28.581
do you have any tips for new DM's?

03:25:28.581 --> 03:25:29.802
MATT: Yes.

03:25:29.802 --> 03:25:30.941
Let's see.

03:25:30.941 --> 03:25:32.917
I could do a whole panel on that.

03:25:32.917 --> 03:25:34.993
Tips for new DMs.

03:25:34.993 --> 03:25:36.414
Preparation is important.

03:25:36.414 --> 03:25:40.954
You wanna outline cities,
come up with ideas for NPCs,

03:25:40.954 --> 03:25:43.707
that you think would be
essential to a story,

03:25:43.707 --> 03:25:46.207
or like people that really
run elements of the town.

03:25:46.207 --> 03:25:47.962
Simple notes can be
like, they're this race,

03:25:47.962 --> 03:25:49.775
this is their disposition,

03:25:49.775 --> 03:25:51.506
if you have a particular
voice you wanna try for,

03:25:51.506 --> 03:25:53.410
make a note of this kind of voice.

03:25:53.410 --> 03:25:55.486
So whenever you come back
to them you have a reminder.

03:25:55.486 --> 03:25:58.048
And spend a lot of time
building that structure,

03:25:58.048 --> 03:25:59.629
you don't have to be too detailed.

03:25:59.629 --> 03:26:01.449
Always leave room to play in the world,

03:26:01.449 --> 03:26:03.304
because you never know what
your players are gonna do.

03:26:03.304 --> 03:26:05.531
Be prepared to improv.

03:26:05.531 --> 03:26:07.129
I prefer loose preparation,

03:26:07.129 --> 03:26:10.945
and then just kinda rolling
where the players take you.

03:26:10.945 --> 03:26:13.872
LIAM: Although you wrote a
monologue for Clarence, right?

03:26:13.872 --> 03:26:15.659
Because that was very intricate.

03:26:15.659 --> 03:26:16.798
We were all just ready--

03:26:16.798 --> 03:26:19.756
ASHLEY: Yeah, there's no way you
just thought that up.

03:26:19.756 --> 03:26:20.902
MATT: There are certain elements,

03:26:20.902 --> 03:26:23.183
part of the notes I take
is for certain NPCs

03:26:23.183 --> 03:26:25.692
I'll write down key
information that they know,

03:26:25.692 --> 03:26:27.230
and depending on how you ask them,

03:26:27.230 --> 03:26:28.063
what you say to them,

03:26:28.063 --> 03:26:29.638
and what you try and extract from them,

03:26:29.638 --> 03:26:32.033
they might give you
some of the information,

03:26:32.033 --> 03:26:34.572
they might not, if you coerce
them, or intimidate them.

03:26:34.572 --> 03:26:37.223
Or if they're willing to
give up the information,

03:26:37.223 --> 03:26:38.525
I have all that written down.

03:26:38.525 --> 03:26:39.859
So for that information today,

03:26:39.859 --> 03:26:42.397
you guys were asking
him, and since you allied

03:26:42.397 --> 03:26:47.020
with Clarence, he was
willing to discuss with you.

03:26:47.020 --> 03:26:48.042
So I had all that prewritten,

03:26:48.042 --> 03:26:49.549
but depending on how much you said,

03:26:49.549 --> 03:26:51.257
it was what you guys asked.

03:26:51.257 --> 03:26:52.590
LIAM: Do you have

03:26:53.482 --> 03:26:55.583
random encounters ready,
in case we're like,

03:26:55.583 --> 03:26:57.574
"ah, fuck it, I don't wanna
go down to the dungeon,

03:26:57.574 --> 03:26:59.524
"I wanna go back up and
beat up some dwarves."

03:26:59.524 --> 03:27:02.923
Do you have shit kind of ready?

03:27:02.923 --> 03:27:05.118
MATT: Yep. I have a stack of different creature

03:27:05.118 --> 03:27:06.554
and encounters already prebuilt,

03:27:06.554 --> 03:27:09.529
based on what you guys may encounter.

03:27:09.529 --> 03:27:11.126
Tonight was an example
of players being able

03:27:11.126 --> 03:27:12.959
to pick what happened.

03:27:13.795 --> 03:27:16.095
But also it's one of those
things where it depended,

03:27:16.095 --> 03:27:17.418
I don't know where you guys are gonna go.

03:27:17.418 --> 03:27:18.761
I present a story,

03:27:18.761 --> 03:27:21.168
I present an idea of a
general throughline,

03:27:21.168 --> 03:27:23.829
but how you guys go
from point A to point B,

03:27:23.829 --> 03:27:24.853
that's entirely up to you.

03:27:24.853 --> 03:27:26.799
Sometimes that can be a
very long, meandering line,

03:27:26.799 --> 03:27:29.524
sometimes it could be a direct ray, so.

03:27:29.524 --> 03:27:31.205
TRAVIS: There was a question, how
much do you improvise,

03:27:31.205 --> 03:27:33.373
and when is it appropriate to improvise?

03:27:33.373 --> 03:27:35.248
MATT: A lot, and always.

03:27:35.248 --> 03:27:37.229
MARISHA: Always, yeah.

03:27:37.229 --> 03:27:38.685
TRAVIS: The answer is yes.

03:27:38.685 --> 03:27:41.215
MATT: I've had whole games where
I've prepared a session,

03:27:41.215 --> 03:27:42.310
and none of it happened,

03:27:42.310 --> 03:27:45.853
because people just put
an entirely wrong direction.

03:27:45.853 --> 03:27:48.112
Not wrong, but a different direction.

03:27:48.112 --> 03:27:49.322
So the whole game was just me

03:27:49.322 --> 03:27:50.827
pulling everything out of my ass.

03:27:50.827 --> 03:27:52.911
MARISHA: Like that time we walked
through the back door

03:27:52.911 --> 03:27:55.073
of the Thieves' Guild, that was fun.

03:27:55.073 --> 03:27:56.476
MATT: Yeah, there was that.

03:27:56.476 --> 03:27:58.886
MARISHA: What's up, Thieves' Guild.

03:27:58.886 --> 03:28:00.318
'Sup.

03:28:02.531 --> 03:28:04.448
ORION: Donkey Kong, Pikachu.

03:28:05.566 --> 03:28:06.399
TRAVIS: What?

03:28:06.399 --> 03:28:07.706
ORION: Somebody asked me what my favorite

03:28:07.706 --> 03:28:09.146
Smash Brothers character is.

03:28:09.146 --> 03:28:10.019
TRAVIS: Oh.

03:28:10.019 --> 03:28:14.081
LIAM: Somebody asked how we
pick the character class

03:28:14.081 --> 03:28:15.567
that we picked.

03:28:15.567 --> 03:28:17.523
When we first started
this game, and I said,

03:28:17.523 --> 03:28:20.766
"hey, it's my birthday,
I wanna play a game."

03:28:20.766 --> 03:28:23.149
Laura really likes rogues as well,

03:28:23.149 --> 03:28:26.462
but I made sure that as
fast as I fucking could.

03:28:26.462 --> 03:28:27.545
TRAVIS: She was pissed.

03:28:27.545 --> 03:28:28.878
LIAM: So she, yeah.

03:28:28.878 --> 03:28:32.692
She plays rogue, in like
Dragon Age and everything.

03:28:32.692 --> 03:28:33.871
That shit's a favorite class of hers,

03:28:33.871 --> 03:28:35.123
so I know I got it out there.

03:28:35.123 --> 03:28:36.817
Also, the reason that we're twins

03:28:36.817 --> 03:28:38.873
is because Laura and I have
the exact same birthday,

03:28:38.873 --> 03:28:39.706
May 28th.

03:28:41.119 --> 03:28:42.289
ASHLEY: I didn't know that.

03:28:42.289 --> 03:28:43.240
MARISHA: I didn't know that either.

03:28:43.240 --> 03:28:45.507
LIAM: That's why we're twins.

03:28:45.507 --> 03:28:46.340
MARISHA: That's cool.

03:28:46.340 --> 03:28:49.113
ASHLEY: I knew-- I came in late to the game,

03:28:49.113 --> 03:28:51.142
and there were only a couple options left.

03:28:51.142 --> 03:28:53.432
And I had never played, so.

03:28:53.432 --> 03:28:55.323
I picked gnome because I
was like, oh, that's funny.

03:28:55.323 --> 03:28:59.162
And then cleric, I didn't really
realize what a cleric was.

03:28:59.162 --> 03:29:03.180
And how detailed it can
be if you've never played.

03:29:03.180 --> 03:29:04.239
And important to the game.

03:29:04.239 --> 03:29:06.618
So when I started I was like, well shit,

03:29:06.618 --> 03:29:09.134
this is a little tougher
than I thought it would be.

03:29:09.134 --> 03:29:13.039
But it's been awesome,
I love being a cleric.

03:29:13.039 --> 03:29:14.278
LIAM: I'm so glad we pulled you in.

03:29:14.278 --> 03:29:16.111
ASHLEY: Me too, man, me too.

03:29:18.532 --> 03:29:21.913
Oh, also, someone asked,
who is Pike's deity.

03:29:21.913 --> 03:29:25.535
And it's Sarenrae, the goddess of healing

03:29:25.535 --> 03:29:28.545
and redemption, among other things.

03:29:28.545 --> 03:29:31.609
MATT: Which is carried over
actually from Pathfinder.

03:29:31.609 --> 03:29:34.447
Fifth Edition has its own suggested,

03:29:34.447 --> 03:29:36.979
there's never a definitive pantheon.

03:29:36.979 --> 03:29:39.398
But they have the deity pantheon.

03:29:39.398 --> 03:29:40.977
But we're carrying over Pathfinder deities

03:29:40.977 --> 03:29:44.092
that were prominently in the campaign
up to this certain point,

03:29:44.092 --> 03:29:45.133
because why the hell not?

03:29:45.133 --> 03:29:46.296
We're not gonna make her change her deity,

03:29:46.296 --> 03:29:47.457
that would be weird.

03:29:47.457 --> 03:29:48.891
MARISHA: Travis, how did you pick your character?

03:29:48.891 --> 03:29:49.724
TRAVIS: What?

03:29:49.724 --> 03:29:50.936
Oh.

03:29:50.936 --> 03:29:54.369
I asked what the biggest
playable character was, I think.

03:29:54.369 --> 03:29:57.869
One that liked to fight, drink, and fight.

03:30:00.998 --> 03:30:02.379
LIAM: One of the greatest pleasures for me,

03:30:02.379 --> 03:30:05.080
and I'm obviously a huge nerdlinger,

03:30:05.080 --> 03:30:08.210
and this is just me reliving high school.

03:30:08.210 --> 03:30:11.091
When I was talking to Sam
about starting all this,

03:30:11.091 --> 03:30:12.332
and saying hey, let's get together,

03:30:12.332 --> 03:30:13.930
it's what I wanna do for my birthday,

03:30:13.930 --> 03:30:17.145
we pulled Travis in,
Travis is fucking tight,

03:30:17.145 --> 03:30:18.295
look at him.

03:30:18.295 --> 03:30:20.761
He's not the stereotypical D&amp;amp;D player,

03:30:20.761 --> 03:30:23.215
and he was as snake bitten as the rest of us.

03:30:23.215 --> 03:30:25.727
Play Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons,
please play Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons.

03:30:25.727 --> 03:30:26.560
TRAVIS: It was so good.

03:30:26.560 --> 03:30:27.393
ASHLEY: It's the best.

03:30:27.393 --> 03:30:28.226
LIAM: It'll make you so happy.

03:30:28.226 --> 03:30:29.322
ORION: What about you?

03:30:29.322 --> 03:30:30.840
Keyleth?

03:30:30.840 --> 03:30:32.922
MARISHA: I remember at the time I had a,

03:30:32.922 --> 03:30:34.203
we were playing another campaign,

03:30:34.203 --> 03:30:36.935
and I had like a rogue assassin,

03:30:36.935 --> 03:30:38.893
that you were in with me.

03:30:38.893 --> 03:30:42.724
And I had a kind of assassin character

03:30:42.724 --> 03:30:47.495
who was super seductress,
and really high charisma.

03:30:47.495 --> 03:30:49.322
And I remember when I joined this game,

03:30:49.322 --> 03:30:52.379
I didn't really know any of you guys

03:30:52.379 --> 03:30:53.243
really all that well,

03:30:53.243 --> 03:30:55.403
and I was kind of new to this world,

03:30:55.403 --> 03:30:58.348
so I ended up going with a kind of druid,

03:30:58.348 --> 03:31:00.815
and I kind of deliberately
made her introvert,

03:31:00.815 --> 03:31:04.648
in a weird way to kind
of reflect my newcoming

03:31:05.743 --> 03:31:07.203
to the group, but I was like,

03:31:07.203 --> 03:31:09.644
"whoa, it'll be like I can be quiet."

03:31:09.644 --> 03:31:11.381
so Keyleth has a really low charisma,

03:31:11.381 --> 03:31:14.743
but I kind of spin it
in that she's naive,

03:31:14.743 --> 03:31:16.484
and doesn't really know.

03:31:16.484 --> 03:31:20.042
And that's why she says
things like, "but Clarence."

03:31:20.042 --> 03:31:21.046
(all laugh)

03:31:21.046 --> 03:31:22.621
MARISHA: "You're just special."

03:31:22.621 --> 03:31:26.033
Because she's naive, and kind of quiet.

03:31:26.033 --> 03:31:27.458
So she was just different than anything

03:31:27.458 --> 03:31:28.910
I've played before.

03:31:28.910 --> 03:31:30.244
But I really love being a druid.

03:31:30.244 --> 03:31:32.267
Druids are great.

03:31:32.267 --> 03:31:34.735
TALIESIN: I played a lot in school.

03:31:34.735 --> 03:31:35.905
Other than Matt,

03:31:35.905 --> 03:31:38.745
I probably had the most
experience playing D&amp;amp;D,

03:31:38.745 --> 03:31:39.887
and playing roleplaying games.

03:31:39.887 --> 03:31:41.175
TRAVIS: Yeah you did.

03:31:41.175 --> 03:31:42.231
Genius.

03:31:42.231 --> 03:31:45.443
TALIESIN: So I was really excited by
the gunslinger in Pathfinder

03:31:45.443 --> 03:31:48.244
just 'cause it was something
I hadn't done before.

03:31:48.244 --> 03:31:51.797
So I found it the most
interesting and unusual,

03:31:51.797 --> 03:31:55.733
but I was not, and I also
felt it was a hole within

03:31:55.733 --> 03:31:57.924
the group that could be filled very well.

03:31:57.924 --> 03:32:00.739
LIAM: Thedouginator
keeps asking you, Matt,

03:32:00.739 --> 03:32:02.484
how you brought the party together

03:32:02.484 --> 03:32:04.760
the first day of play.

03:32:04.760 --> 03:32:07.972
MARISHA: Wait, we haven't heard
Tiberius' story as sorcerer.

03:32:07.972 --> 03:32:10.770
Then we can answer that question.

03:32:10.770 --> 03:32:12.325
ORION: When this was going on,

03:32:12.325 --> 03:32:15.142
I asked Matt if there was a caster yet,

03:32:15.142 --> 03:32:18.794
like any glass cannons, and he said no.

03:32:18.794 --> 03:32:22.377
So I debated between
a wizard and sorcerer.

03:32:23.510 --> 03:32:26.502
When we went over the different mechanics,

03:32:26.502 --> 03:32:29.167
how a wizard and a sorcerer works,

03:32:29.167 --> 03:32:31.268
I was more drawn to that.

03:32:31.268 --> 03:32:33.945
And I'm a huge RPG guy.

03:32:33.945 --> 03:32:36.028
LIAM: You're so entertaining.

03:32:36.963 --> 03:32:38.960
ORION: To piggyback a quick question,

03:32:38.960 --> 03:32:41.556
to seal off the Tiberius thing,

03:32:41.556 --> 03:32:44.306
somebody asked if any of our voice acting

03:32:44.306 --> 03:32:46.765
influences our characters.

03:32:46.765 --> 03:32:48.446
Tiberius, absolutely.

03:32:48.446 --> 03:32:52.446
I played Elminster Aumar
in the Neverwinter MMO.

03:32:53.872 --> 03:32:55.426
Which is a D&amp;amp;D MMO.

03:32:55.426 --> 03:32:57.180
And when we started this

03:32:57.180 --> 03:32:59.847
I'm essentially doing Elminster,

03:33:01.739 --> 03:33:04.072
but I made him super bubbly.

03:33:07.302 --> 03:33:09.586
TALIESIN: No, someone asked how the group, yeah.

03:33:09.586 --> 03:33:12.037
MATT: We got together, first
session, essentially,

03:33:12.037 --> 03:33:14.823
was in a swamp town named Stillben,

03:33:14.823 --> 03:33:16.989
and the group at the time had,

03:33:16.989 --> 03:33:18.480
for their own separate reasons,

03:33:18.480 --> 03:33:20.514
been in this town, needing money,

03:33:20.514 --> 03:33:24.064
and had kind of come
together as a mercenary group

03:33:24.064 --> 03:33:25.641
out of necessity.

03:33:25.641 --> 03:33:29.356
So the first session was
them having known each other

03:33:29.356 --> 03:33:32.319
from a circumstance where they
all ended up helping out

03:33:32.319 --> 03:33:34.940
an individual in the city, long story short,

03:33:34.940 --> 03:33:37.237
they had a small rapport,

03:33:37.237 --> 03:33:39.162
and knew at least each
other were useful,

03:33:39.162 --> 03:33:40.643
and needed cash.

03:33:40.643 --> 03:33:41.811
And there was a job board in the town.

03:33:41.811 --> 03:33:44.621
So the first session was them being hired

03:33:44.621 --> 03:33:48.134
to look into a conspiracy
within this swamp

03:33:48.134 --> 03:33:50.566
port town, Stillben.

03:33:50.566 --> 03:33:52.387
That was their first
real adventure together.

03:33:52.387 --> 03:33:56.578
And when that finished,
they kept going from there.

03:33:56.578 --> 03:33:58.483
ORION: Uh, troll penis story.

03:33:58.483 --> 03:33:59.316
ASHLEY: Troll penis.

03:33:59.316 --> 03:34:00.665
(all laugh)

03:34:00.665 --> 03:34:01.498
MARISHA: That's fair.

03:34:01.498 --> 03:34:03.045
ORION: I know you guys keep asking.

03:34:03.045 --> 03:34:05.382
LIAM: Take it away, Mercer.

03:34:05.382 --> 03:34:07.132
MATT: There was a battle.

03:34:08.275 --> 03:34:09.672
Subterranean battle
that involved the party

03:34:09.672 --> 03:34:13.839
sneaking upon a group of two
trolls that were around a fire.

03:34:14.812 --> 03:34:18.513
The idea to work past
this came to Tiberius

03:34:18.513 --> 03:34:22.808
to transform himself
visually into a female troll

03:34:22.808 --> 03:34:24.572
so he could Bugs Bunny them.

03:34:24.572 --> 03:34:27.565
Hey boys, you know, that thing.

03:34:27.565 --> 03:34:29.371
Not knowing the temperament of trolls,

03:34:29.371 --> 03:34:31.120
especially ones that are deep underground,

03:34:31.120 --> 03:34:32.933
and don't get to see
female trolls very often,

03:34:32.933 --> 03:34:34.636
they immediately just
got extremely aggressive,

03:34:34.636 --> 03:34:35.826
and he found himself almost between

03:34:35.826 --> 03:34:37.826
a rock and a hard place.

03:34:38.761 --> 03:34:41.082
ORION: I was getting raped by trolls.

03:34:41.082 --> 03:34:44.111
MATT: The party then descended
upon these trolls,

03:34:44.111 --> 03:34:47.142
and in the middle of
battle, at numerous times,

03:34:47.142 --> 03:34:49.825
I believe Percy once and Laura the other,

03:34:49.825 --> 03:34:54.225
both took specific shots
at each troll's dick.

03:34:54.225 --> 03:34:59.055
Rolled a good shot with enough
damage to blow them off.

03:34:59.055 --> 03:35:02.369
Now being a troll, they regenerate.

03:35:02.369 --> 03:35:05.919
But it was still a good effect,
and when the battle was over,

03:35:05.919 --> 03:35:07.687
it was decided by the party to at least

03:35:07.687 --> 03:35:10.065
take one as a trophy and place
it in the bag of holding.

03:35:10.065 --> 03:35:12.193
TRAVIS: That was decided by me, thank you.

03:35:12.193 --> 03:35:14.507
MATT: By Grog, and as such,
it stayed for a while,

03:35:14.507 --> 03:35:16.505
until it was used as an
implement of distraction

03:35:16.505 --> 03:35:17.870
in another encounter I believe.

03:35:17.870 --> 03:35:18.703
TRAVIS: It worked.

03:35:18.703 --> 03:35:19.536
MATT: Yeah, it worked.

03:35:19.536 --> 03:35:20.825
That was where troll dick came from.

03:35:20.825 --> 03:35:22.287
ORION: It was spitroasting.

03:35:22.287 --> 03:35:24.788
LIAM: Jake Bodro asked what's it like playing

03:35:24.788 --> 03:35:27.023
for three hours in front of 2,500 people?

03:35:27.023 --> 03:35:29.923
I think our games have
gotten a little bit better,

03:35:29.923 --> 03:35:32.761
only because when we play privately,

03:35:32.761 --> 03:35:35.828
there were sometimes lulls,
where we weren't sure what to do,

03:35:35.828 --> 03:35:38.025
we would go off to bathroom,
we would take a break.

03:35:38.025 --> 03:35:40.787
But now there's a little bit
of the element of theater to it.

03:35:40.787 --> 03:35:42.329
Just a sprinkle of it.

03:35:42.329 --> 03:35:44.580
And it kinda of gooses the energy up.

03:35:44.580 --> 03:35:46.049
ORION: I'm doing the same thing for the record.

03:35:48.284 --> 03:35:49.586
TRAVIS: I keep seeing this one.

03:35:49.586 --> 03:35:51.479
For the 11 year old Sadie,

03:35:51.479 --> 03:35:53.251
the son of Odin shall have that cookie!

03:35:53.251 --> 03:35:54.834
MATT: Aw, that's sweet.

03:35:56.223 --> 03:35:57.473
ASHLEY: There you go.

03:35:59.093 --> 03:36:00.809
MATT: There is one bag of holding in the group,

03:36:00.809 --> 03:36:02.726
and Grog always has it.

03:36:04.026 --> 03:36:07.091
TRAVIS: A troll dick
and a bulette tongue.

03:36:07.091 --> 03:36:08.427
MATT: There are many things
that go into the bag.

03:36:08.427 --> 03:36:09.465
TRAVIS: It hasn't gone in that bag.

03:36:09.465 --> 03:36:10.793
TALIESIN: Is there still a cow in the bag?

03:36:10.793 --> 03:36:12.639
TRAVIS: No, Dork the ox.

03:36:12.639 --> 03:36:14.338
MATT: Dork the ox is probably not.

03:36:14.338 --> 03:36:17.876
TRAVIS: That's when we first
learned its limitations.

03:36:17.876 --> 03:36:20.696
MATT: Why does Scanlan have
so many awesome spells?

03:36:20.696 --> 03:36:21.974
Bards in Fifth Edition have one

03:36:21.974 --> 03:36:23.650
of the options they can choose.

03:36:23.650 --> 03:36:25.317
As they level up,

03:36:25.317 --> 03:36:27.798
can choose a couple of spells
from any spellcasting class,

03:36:27.798 --> 03:36:29.891
which is great, and the boon that
bards kinda needed to be

03:36:29.891 --> 03:36:31.393
more combat-effective.

03:36:31.393 --> 03:36:33.330
And you can choose the School of Lore

03:36:33.330 --> 03:36:36.161
or the School of Combat,
I think, for the bard.

03:36:36.161 --> 03:36:37.113
He chose the School of
Lore which allows you

03:36:37.113 --> 03:36:38.615
even more spells from other classes

03:36:38.615 --> 03:36:39.739
to boost your repertoire,

03:36:39.739 --> 03:36:42.952
so he became a fucking amazing bard.

03:36:42.952 --> 03:36:47.287
LIAM: Also, Sam Riegel did a lot
of a capella in college.

03:36:47.287 --> 03:36:49.612
TRAVIS: He did, he really did.

03:36:49.612 --> 03:36:53.884
LIAM: He helped write several
seasons of The Voice,

03:36:53.884 --> 03:36:55.195
which was all about a capella,

03:36:55.195 --> 03:36:58.087
so Samis sort of a ringer
for the bard class.

03:36:58.087 --> 03:36:59.242
MATT: Yeah, kinda had to happen that way.

03:36:59.242 --> 03:37:01.106
TRAVIS: Can Marisha do her dwarf impersonation?

03:37:01.106 --> 03:37:01.939
MARISHA: Nope.

03:37:02.864 --> 03:37:03.697
LIAM: Yordee yorda--

03:37:03.697 --> 03:37:05.769
MARISHA: Yorda youree yourdee yourd.

03:37:05.769 --> 03:37:08.985
ASHLEY: Someone asked if Grog could keep

03:37:08.985 --> 03:37:11.118
one of his women in the bag of holding.

03:37:11.118 --> 03:37:13.400
You can't put living things
in the bag of holding.

03:37:13.400 --> 03:37:14.720
TALIESIN: As we've learned.

03:37:14.720 --> 03:37:16.102
MATT: You can.
MARISHA: With Dork.

03:37:16.102 --> 03:37:17.508
MATT: They just die.

03:37:17.508 --> 03:37:19.894
TRAVIS: There's no air, it's like a vacuum.

03:37:19.894 --> 03:37:21.019
A magical vacuum.

03:37:21.019 --> 03:37:22.305
MATT: Dork the ox did not survive.

03:37:23.473 --> 03:37:26.391
TRAVIS: One giant dead ox came out of the bag.

03:37:26.391 --> 03:37:28.233
LIAM: Someone keeps asking if any of us

03:37:28.233 --> 03:37:30.608
have hirelings, or henchmen,

03:37:30.608 --> 03:37:32.012
and the simple answer to that is no.

03:37:32.012 --> 03:37:33.116
MATT: That's not true.

03:37:33.116 --> 03:37:33.949
LIAM: Just Trinket.

03:37:33.949 --> 03:37:35.443
ORION: At our Keep.

03:37:35.443 --> 03:37:36.276
TALIESIN: We do.

03:37:36.276 --> 03:37:37.859
LIAM: Oh, that's right!

03:37:38.905 --> 03:37:40.085
TRAVIS: Yeah, we battle-tested them.

03:37:40.085 --> 03:37:41.687
ORION: We have a Keep back in--

03:37:41.687 --> 03:37:42.787
LIAM: Right before we started.

03:37:42.787 --> 03:37:44.288
TRAVIS: The game before we came here.

03:37:44.288 --> 03:37:46.163
After they saved the kingdom of Eman,

03:37:46.163 --> 03:37:48.856
the sovereign Uriel Tal'Dorei III,

03:37:48.856 --> 03:37:51.000
as part of his gift to the group

03:37:51.000 --> 03:37:53.025
for essentially saving his family

03:37:53.025 --> 03:37:57.974
and the city itself, had a
Keep constructed for them,

03:37:57.974 --> 03:37:59.107
and took about six months or so,

03:37:59.107 --> 03:37:59.940
and the Keep was finished,

03:37:59.940 --> 03:38:02.678
and then the party's first
session

03:38:02.678 --> 03:38:05.399
was them finding who they're going to hire

03:38:05.399 --> 03:38:06.662
to take care of the Keep for them.

03:38:06.662 --> 03:38:08.959
LIAM: It was like one episode of the Sims.

03:38:08.959 --> 03:38:09.792
MATT: Kind of.

03:38:09.792 --> 03:38:12.372
It was great too, 'cause Grog's whole idea

03:38:12.372 --> 03:38:14.807
of making them to see who
would be the better hire

03:38:14.807 --> 03:38:16.759
was to break the pool cue and be like,

03:38:16.759 --> 03:38:17.843
"who survives?"

03:38:17.843 --> 03:38:19.092
Make them fight, it was pretty great.

03:38:19.092 --> 03:38:22.618
TALIESIN: For Tone17, I played
a modified Malkavian,

03:38:22.618 --> 03:38:24.789
and a Smetty if you can
believe such a thing,

03:38:24.789 --> 03:38:27.120
which was badass.

03:38:27.120 --> 03:38:28.174
MATT: There you go.

03:38:28.174 --> 03:38:30.921
LIAM: We've been playing for
two and a half years.

03:38:30.921 --> 03:38:32.166
Someone wanted to know how long.

03:38:32.166 --> 03:38:33.111
TALIESIN: Oh my God, really?

03:38:33.111 --> 03:38:34.530
TRAVIS: Did we tell them about your podcast

03:38:34.530 --> 03:38:36.080
with the recording of the very first one?

03:38:39.600 --> 03:38:44.275
LIAM: If you want, Sam and I,
it's kind of languishing,

03:38:44.275 --> 03:38:47.255
but we have a podcast
together called AllWorkNoPlay.

03:38:47.255 --> 03:38:48.088
TRAVIS: It's amazing.

03:38:48.088 --> 03:38:50.341
LIAM: We're both parents, we have kids,

03:38:50.341 --> 03:38:52.147
so we have no time to do anything.

03:38:52.147 --> 03:38:55.217
Enough time to take a shit.

03:38:55.217 --> 03:38:56.632
The first or second episode,

03:38:56.632 --> 03:38:59.334
the first episode is about
us playing the first game,

03:38:59.334 --> 03:39:01.678
and there's audio from the first game.

03:39:01.678 --> 03:39:05.845
Again, go to iTunes, or to
AllWorkNoPlay on Pod Bean,

03:39:08.140 --> 03:39:10.550
and you'll hear about two minutes of us

03:39:10.550 --> 03:39:14.096
dealing with a puzzle
that Matt threw at us.

03:39:14.096 --> 03:39:15.197
MARISHA: It was timed.

03:39:15.197 --> 03:39:18.854
LIAM: Yeah, it was timed, there
was an hourglass going off.

03:39:18.854 --> 03:39:22.490
It was us discovering
D&amp;amp;D really for the first time.

03:39:22.490 --> 03:39:24.924
AllWorkNoPlay, all one word.

03:39:24.924 --> 03:39:26.234
MARISHA: Actually one of my favorite stories

03:39:26.234 --> 03:39:28.133
that I tell all the time is about you,

03:39:28.133 --> 03:39:31.759
from our first game, 'cause if
you remember, I didn't play.

03:39:31.759 --> 03:39:35.228
I just kinda helped Matt help you guys.

03:39:35.228 --> 03:39:37.102
I was like a D&amp;amp;D minion.

03:39:37.102 --> 03:39:38.544
And I remember I was helping you,

03:39:38.544 --> 03:39:40.169
and I remember you were like,

03:39:40.169 --> 03:39:44.971
"So, if I just wanted to go
up and punch those guards,

03:39:44.971 --> 03:39:46.225
"I could do that?"

03:39:46.225 --> 03:39:47.453
And I was like, yeah,
well you would go up,

03:39:47.453 --> 03:39:48.286
and you would punch them,

03:39:48.286 --> 03:39:50.278
and then Matt would tell
you how you'd do that.

03:39:50.278 --> 03:39:53.861
And then you went like
this, you were like.

03:39:56.361 --> 03:39:57.194
TRAVIS: Computing.

03:39:57.194 --> 03:40:00.922
MARISHA: Yeah, you were like,
"so, we can do anything?"

03:40:00.922 --> 03:40:02.392
(all laugh)

03:40:02.392 --> 03:40:04.142
MARISHA: And I was like, yeah.

03:40:05.371 --> 03:40:09.125
LIAM: Taliesin on game one
was actually not Percy,

03:40:09.125 --> 03:40:11.024
he was a dragonborn paladin?

03:40:11.024 --> 03:40:12.229
TALIESIN: I was a dragonborn paladin.

03:40:12.229 --> 03:40:14.321
LIAM: You fucking blew our minds, we were like,

03:40:14.321 --> 03:40:15.154
"what do I do?

03:40:15.154 --> 03:40:17.179
"Can I do damage points
to stop this puzzle."

03:40:17.179 --> 03:40:19.591
There was this tunnel with
all these moving parts,

03:40:19.591 --> 03:40:21.233
we thought we were gonna be crushed,

03:40:21.233 --> 03:40:23.220
and he was a dragonborn
for the first episode.

03:40:23.220 --> 03:40:25.720
It's in the recording on the
the AllWorkNoPlay podcast.

03:40:25.720 --> 03:40:30.276
And he just breathed ice
on this water-based--

03:40:30.276 --> 03:40:31.749
TALIESIN: Contraption.

03:40:31.749 --> 03:40:33.803
LIAM: And froze it, and everyone was like,

03:40:33.803 --> 03:40:34.827
"you can do that?

03:40:34.827 --> 03:40:36.256
"You can't just roll dice and hit it?"

03:40:36.256 --> 03:40:37.855
And that's when we kind of understood

03:40:37.855 --> 03:40:39.353
oh, it's whatever the fuck you want.

03:40:39.353 --> 03:40:41.552
TALIESIN: That was such a good game for learning

03:40:41.552 --> 03:40:42.890
the basic mechanics.

03:40:42.890 --> 03:40:44.037
Such a well put together game.

03:40:44.037 --> 03:40:46.404
ORION: Matt does control the
music while we play.

03:40:46.404 --> 03:40:47.643
MATT: Yes, I have playlists.

03:40:47.643 --> 03:40:49.583
They were much more broad playlists before,

03:40:49.583 --> 03:40:50.796
unfortunately on the stream,

03:40:50.796 --> 03:40:54.270
we have to use only
approved royalty-free music,

03:40:54.270 --> 03:40:55.911
so it took me a while to
figure it out previous to this.

03:40:55.911 --> 03:40:57.227
TRAVIS: I do miss those Madonna songs.

03:40:57.227 --> 03:40:58.417
MATT: I know.

03:40:58.417 --> 03:41:00.562
I used to play a lot of Bush.

03:41:00.562 --> 03:41:02.425
MARISHA: Hey, would that count as fan art?

03:41:02.425 --> 03:41:05.049
If fans made us music?

03:41:05.049 --> 03:41:05.882
TRAVIS: Yeah.

03:41:05.882 --> 03:41:06.715
MARISHA: Could we then use that?

03:41:08.365 --> 03:41:09.978
Yeah? He's nodding.

03:41:09.978 --> 03:41:11.678
ZAC: They can send
us whatever they want.

03:41:11.678 --> 03:41:13.795
MARISHA: Some consent forms? Yeah.

03:41:13.795 --> 03:41:14.713
TRAVIS: If one of your characters died,
would you roll a new character?

03:41:14.713 --> 03:41:16.145
ORION: Music people out there.

03:41:16.145 --> 03:41:18.467
MARISHA: Any music people.

03:41:18.467 --> 03:41:21.016
Anything atmospheric.

03:41:22.980 --> 03:41:24.108
LIAM: No, no, that's an important question.

03:41:24.108 --> 03:41:24.941
TRAVIS: Ignore it.

03:41:24.941 --> 03:41:25.774
LIAM: No, it's important.

03:41:25.774 --> 03:41:27.579
Someone's asking, if we die,

03:41:27.579 --> 03:41:29.613
would we roll in a new character?

03:41:29.613 --> 03:41:31.723
And plus, we just started this show,

03:41:31.723 --> 03:41:33.115
so part of us were wondering like,

03:41:33.115 --> 03:41:34.254
what if we die the second episode?

03:41:34.254 --> 03:41:35.087
What happens?

03:41:35.087 --> 03:41:38.089
We recorded this opening
to the show that's coming.

03:41:38.089 --> 03:41:39.769
MATT: So here's how I run the world.

03:41:39.769 --> 03:41:42.372
I feel that one of the
problems in some RPGs

03:41:42.372 --> 03:41:43.948
is that death becomes flippant when magic

03:41:43.948 --> 03:41:45.790
allows you to completely undo it.

03:41:45.790 --> 03:41:48.252
In my campaigns certain powerful spells

03:41:48.252 --> 03:41:50.860
like Greater Restoration, Resurrection,

03:41:50.860 --> 03:41:52.713
things like that are a challenge,

03:41:52.713 --> 03:41:54.847
meaning you can definitely undo death,

03:41:54.847 --> 03:41:56.850
but a lot of it is based
on your capabilities

03:41:56.850 --> 03:41:58.004
as a spellcaster,

03:41:58.004 --> 03:42:00.538
your attachment to the people
you've been traveling with.

03:42:00.538 --> 03:42:03.099
So if ever a character does die,

03:42:03.099 --> 03:42:06.849
a resurrection can be attempted,
but it is a challenge.

03:42:06.849 --> 03:42:08.679
Which means there's a
possibility of it failing.

03:42:08.679 --> 03:42:10.897
In which case, if the resurrection fails,

03:42:10.897 --> 03:42:13.717
the soul is lost, the
character is permanently dead.

03:42:13.717 --> 03:42:16.189
The player then can leave
and never come back

03:42:16.189 --> 03:42:17.022
if they want to,

03:42:17.022 --> 03:42:18.565
but they have the option
to create a new character,

03:42:18.565 --> 03:42:20.104
and be reintroduced to the campaign

03:42:20.104 --> 03:42:22.375
like half a level lower than the rest.

03:42:22.375 --> 03:42:23.818
ASHLEY: That would suck so much.

03:42:23.818 --> 03:42:27.064
LIAM: When Pike died we had, all of us,

03:42:27.064 --> 03:42:29.327
many series of dice rolls to do,

03:42:29.327 --> 03:42:31.363
and it was very story-based.

03:42:31.363 --> 03:42:33.247
MARISHA: Yeah people are asking how she came back.

03:42:33.247 --> 03:42:36.696
LIAM: Yeah, I mean, luckily
we were in a big city,

03:42:36.696 --> 03:42:37.836
there was a huge temple.

03:42:37.836 --> 03:42:40.670
There were very wise clerics who were good

03:42:40.670 --> 03:42:41.672
at bringing people back.

03:42:41.672 --> 03:42:43.291
But still, we all had to roll.

03:42:43.291 --> 03:42:45.451
There was three rounds we had to roll,

03:42:45.451 --> 03:42:47.204
he might have fudged
numbers, I don't know.

03:42:47.204 --> 03:42:49.621
But we were all still scared.

03:42:51.117 --> 03:42:52.985
We had to all, the majority of us,

03:42:52.985 --> 03:42:56.047
had to have good rolls
three times in a row.

03:42:56.047 --> 03:42:57.181
Scanlan had to put--

03:42:57.181 --> 03:42:58.646
TRAVIS: The tears of three women in the room.

03:42:58.646 --> 03:43:01.601
LIAM: The tears, Scanlan had
to kiss her on the head,

03:43:01.601 --> 03:43:03.254
he put a figure that he carved of her,

03:43:03.254 --> 03:43:04.831
it was very elaborate.

03:43:04.831 --> 03:43:07.777
This one was majorly in tears.

03:43:07.777 --> 03:43:09.455
Laura was in tears.

03:43:09.455 --> 03:43:10.865
ASHLEY: I was in tears.

03:43:10.865 --> 03:43:12.479
TALIESIN: Laura was hyperventilating.

03:43:12.479 --> 03:43:14.744
ORION: And when that was going on, I remember,

03:43:14.744 --> 03:43:17.245
when that went off, being still Tiberius,

03:43:17.245 --> 03:43:19.708
I was like in half character but half not,

03:43:19.708 --> 03:43:22.945
and I was not crying,
I was like, (grumbles)

03:43:22.945 --> 03:43:23.778
the whole time,

03:43:23.778 --> 03:43:26.181
and as soon as she sprung back to life,

03:43:26.181 --> 03:43:27.155
because the cleric--

03:43:27.155 --> 03:43:29.183
MATT: Breathed in her first breath after that.

03:43:29.183 --> 03:43:31.959
ORION: We luckily, because I
know it was a tight roll.

03:43:31.959 --> 03:43:32.866
MATT: It was a very tight roll.

03:43:32.866 --> 03:43:35.214
It was a DC of 14 in the final roll,

03:43:35.214 --> 03:43:39.075
and because Scanlan brought
out this figure of her

03:43:39.075 --> 03:43:41.720
that he had carved for her
like two months beforehand

03:43:41.720 --> 03:43:44.015
as a gift, sets it down and
kisses her on the forehead,

03:43:44.015 --> 03:43:47.116
and it was kinda the
final connection point.

03:43:47.116 --> 03:43:51.116
He needed 14, he rolled
a 12, but, because he--

03:43:54.129 --> 03:43:57.894
There's a plus two modifier to
the skill check, being a bard,

03:43:57.894 --> 03:44:00.783
and that was what he
needed, he just made it.

03:44:00.783 --> 03:44:01.928
Basic, basic--

03:44:01.928 --> 03:44:03.530
LIAM: Someone's asking if we drink while playing,

03:44:03.530 --> 03:44:04.876
and the answer is no.

03:44:04.876 --> 03:44:06.582
(all laugh)

03:44:06.582 --> 03:44:07.915
TRAVIS: It's just water in those tankards.

03:44:09.335 --> 03:44:10.978
TALIESIN: Coffee.

03:44:14.674 --> 03:44:15.941
MARISHA: I almost did, yeah.

03:44:15.941 --> 03:44:20.361
ORION: When she came back to
life is when Tiberius,

03:44:20.361 --> 03:44:23.854
I was like, "oh my God, she's okay!"

03:44:23.854 --> 03:44:26.343
ASHLEY: I think also having--

03:44:26.343 --> 03:44:29.080
Because with magic and
everything like that,

03:44:29.080 --> 03:44:31.881
just bringing somebody
back to life so easily,

03:44:31.881 --> 03:44:36.048
since we don't have that as
much as maybe other games--

03:44:37.184 --> 03:44:39.460
It's heightened, so every
time someone gets hurt,

03:44:39.460 --> 03:44:42.180
we're all, I think now,
after having that death,

03:44:42.180 --> 03:44:43.585
all of us are like, "where are you at?

03:44:43.585 --> 03:44:44.524
"Where are you at?"

03:44:44.524 --> 03:44:45.747
ORION: Where are you going?

03:44:45.747 --> 03:44:48.848
I wish I could turn to
Sam, but he's not here.

03:44:48.848 --> 03:44:52.160
ASHLEY: We're all so stressed out now, which is,

03:44:52.160 --> 03:44:53.350
it's kinda cool.

03:44:53.350 --> 03:44:55.514
MATT: Mortality's a real thing
you have to deal with,

03:44:55.514 --> 03:44:57.122
and up until Pike's death it was kind of

03:44:57.122 --> 03:44:59.262
a thing people weren't considering.

03:44:59.262 --> 03:45:01.696
It just happened so suddenly.

03:45:01.696 --> 03:45:03.993
LIAM: One I see keep coming up
since we started is

03:45:03.993 --> 03:45:08.160
how would we react to life
if we were our characters?

03:45:10.352 --> 03:45:12.305
I don't know, or differently
from our characters?

03:45:12.305 --> 03:45:15.612
'Cause I wouldn't stab my
children when they frustrate me.

03:45:15.612 --> 03:45:17.134
MATT: I'd be in a padded room.

03:45:17.134 --> 03:45:19.551
(all laugh)

03:45:19.551 --> 03:45:22.697
MARISHA: I feel like everyone
tries to make decisions

03:45:22.697 --> 03:45:26.168
in a game that their character
would make in real life,

03:45:26.168 --> 03:45:27.788
'cause that's kind of the point.

03:45:27.788 --> 03:45:32.462
I take into consideration
that I have shitty charisma,

03:45:32.462 --> 03:45:33.954
whenever I open my mouth.

03:45:33.954 --> 03:45:36.429
I feel like we all try and
take into consideration

03:45:36.429 --> 03:45:38.068
our background and our alignment,

03:45:38.068 --> 03:45:39.566
because that's, you know.

03:45:39.566 --> 03:45:41.736
TALIESIN: I feel significantly more
badass than my character.

03:45:44.285 --> 03:45:45.202
ORION: I feel...

03:45:47.460 --> 03:45:49.372
Tiberius is just me with magic.

03:45:51.000 --> 03:45:52.165
So that's how I feel.

03:45:52.165 --> 03:45:53.770
TRAVIS: Grog was easy, he makes bad decisions,

03:45:53.770 --> 03:45:56.103
which is just all that I do.

03:45:58.767 --> 03:46:00.315
MATT: Pike died when they were fighting

03:46:00.315 --> 03:46:01.492
what was called a treachery demon,

03:46:01.492 --> 03:46:02.659
or a glabrezu,

03:46:03.566 --> 03:46:07.384
which had basically infiltrated the

03:46:07.384 --> 03:46:11.254
Sovereign Uriel, and the city of Emon.

03:46:11.254 --> 03:46:12.821
And when it revealed its final form,

03:46:12.821 --> 03:46:14.515
it got one lucky critical hit on Pike

03:46:14.515 --> 03:46:17.798
when she was too close, and
just instantly took her out.

03:46:17.798 --> 03:46:18.922
That's how she died.

03:46:18.922 --> 03:46:21.203
Someone's asking if they can (laughs)

03:46:21.203 --> 03:46:23.027
send us equipment we need for the show.

03:46:23.027 --> 03:46:23.860
Zac.

03:46:23.860 --> 03:46:24.768
ZAC: Yeah, they can.

03:46:24.768 --> 03:46:25.601
MATT: What do you need?

03:46:25.601 --> 03:46:26.555
ZAC: We'll put it on the wishlist.

03:46:26.555 --> 03:46:27.610
MATT: There you go, it's on the wishlist.

03:46:27.610 --> 03:46:28.479
ORION: There's a wishlist?

03:46:28.479 --> 03:46:30.654
MATT: I didn't know there was
one, but now there is.

03:46:30.654 --> 03:46:32.631
ZAC: Castle Greyskull on there.

03:46:32.631 --> 03:46:35.798
LIAM: How do we feel about Team Demihooman,

03:46:37.513 --> 03:46:40.570
and inspiring them to play
D&amp;amp;D for the first time?

03:46:40.570 --> 03:46:42.599
I think the number one
reason we all wanna do this

03:46:42.599 --> 03:46:45.262
is because we love each
other, and we love this game.

03:46:45.262 --> 03:46:46.999
The second thing is we all knew,

03:46:46.999 --> 03:46:49.120
we kind of felt like--

03:46:49.120 --> 03:46:52.446
We're gonna make Dungeons
&amp;amp; Dragons cool again.

03:46:52.446 --> 03:46:53.337
MATT: Try at least.

03:46:54.394 --> 03:46:56.075
LIAM: And make it open for anyone to do,

03:46:56.075 --> 03:46:58.175
there's no reason not to do this.

03:46:58.175 --> 03:47:00.762
If there's someone you know
who doesn't understand it,

03:47:00.762 --> 03:47:01.897
don't worry about it.

03:47:01.897 --> 03:47:05.165
Just find some friends
and connect with them.

03:47:05.165 --> 03:47:06.380
MATT: I find one of the difficult things

03:47:06.380 --> 03:47:09.008
is explaining to somebody
who has never played an RPG,

03:47:09.008 --> 03:47:11.216
or a game of D&amp;amp;D at all, they're like,

03:47:11.216 --> 03:47:13.280
"how does it work, what is it?"

03:47:13.280 --> 03:47:15.652
And it's hard to explain, so if anything,

03:47:15.652 --> 03:47:18.422
now we have an example with this show.

03:47:18.422 --> 03:47:19.724
Other than the IT Crowd episode,

03:47:19.724 --> 03:47:21.859
or the Community episode,

03:47:21.859 --> 03:47:23.719
which are both great
examples for quick little

03:47:23.719 --> 03:47:24.762
succinct things.

03:47:24.762 --> 03:47:26.584
TALIESIN: If we had the power to
bring one guest player

03:47:26.584 --> 03:47:27.417
for one session.

03:47:27.417 --> 03:47:28.613
ORION: Oh, that's easy.

03:47:28.613 --> 03:47:30.142
Tom Hanks, for sure.

03:47:30.142 --> 03:47:32.708
(all laugh)

03:47:32.708 --> 03:47:33.721
MARISHA: Mazes and Madness.

03:47:33.721 --> 03:47:34.565
ZAC: Everyone is asking for you guys

03:47:34.565 --> 03:47:35.820
to somehow get Vin Diesel.

03:47:35.820 --> 03:47:37.375
MARISHA: I was gonna say, Vin Diesel.

03:47:37.375 --> 03:47:38.422
ORION: He lives for this shit!

03:47:38.422 --> 03:47:40.334
MATT: Vin Diesel's good.

03:47:40.334 --> 03:47:42.042
Top of my list is Stephen Colbert,

03:47:42.042 --> 03:47:43.914
because I know he also plays.

03:47:43.914 --> 03:47:45.107
ASHLEY: That would be amazing.

03:47:45.107 --> 03:47:47.939
TALIESIN: I would love to see Joss Whedon do this.

03:47:47.939 --> 03:47:50.469
I admit I would like to
see Joss Whedon play D&amp;amp;D.

03:47:50.469 --> 03:47:52.020
That'd be interesting.

03:47:53.530 --> 03:47:54.442
ZAC: That might be possible.

03:47:54.442 --> 03:47:55.617
TALIESIN: Okay, I'm throwing that one out there.

03:47:55.617 --> 03:47:56.985
ORION: What, Tom Hanks isn't?

03:47:56.985 --> 03:47:58.223
MARISHA: Felicia's got some.

03:47:59.315 --> 03:48:02.732
MATT: But he's also a super fuckin' busy man.

03:48:04.042 --> 03:48:06.586
ORION: Guys, tweet at Tom Hanks
to come play with us.

03:48:06.586 --> 03:48:09.062
TRAVIS: I'm Morgan Freeman, and I rolled a one.

03:48:09.062 --> 03:48:11.812
MATT: Right now, Critical Role Hanks.

03:48:13.108 --> 03:48:15.444
See if we can make it trend.

03:48:15.444 --> 03:48:16.635
Patton Oswalt would be great.

03:48:16.635 --> 03:48:18.429
ORION: That'd be hilarious.

03:48:18.429 --> 03:48:19.936
ZAC: What about Dan Harmon,

03:48:19.936 --> 03:48:21.585
just so I can get fired, can we do that?

03:48:21.585 --> 03:48:23.437
(all laugh)

03:48:23.437 --> 03:48:24.782
MATT: Yeah.

03:48:24.782 --> 03:48:26.898
Hardwick used to play
D&amp;amp;D with Patton Oswalt

03:48:26.898 --> 03:48:28.534
in the mid-2000s.

03:48:28.534 --> 03:48:29.974
I can't even imagine what
those games were like.

03:48:29.974 --> 03:48:31.918
ORION: I'd like to like--

03:48:31.918 --> 03:48:34.956
Amy Poehler, I'd like
to have one of those.

03:48:34.956 --> 03:48:36.653
ZAC: She might be open to that.

03:48:36.653 --> 03:48:38.523
She's a partner with Legendary.

03:48:38.523 --> 03:48:41.883
ORION: I'd love her, Tina, Tina Fey.

03:48:41.883 --> 03:48:43.160
LIAM: Someone keeps asking about Troy,

03:48:43.160 --> 03:48:46.338
I don't know if Troy Baker is ready.

03:48:47.854 --> 03:48:49.746
ORION: I don't think he's ready for this jelly.

03:48:51.284 --> 03:48:52.280
You guys think he's ready for this jelly?

03:48:52.280 --> 03:48:53.790
I don't think so.

03:48:53.790 --> 03:48:54.891
MATT: Whenever it comes up in conversation,

03:48:54.891 --> 03:48:57.044
Troy always gives me that look of like...

03:48:57.044 --> 03:48:58.080
"All right."

03:48:58.080 --> 03:49:01.147
TRAVIS: You can see him swimming
in the infinity of--

03:49:01.147 --> 03:49:02.613
MARISHA: "That's not cool."

03:49:02.613 --> 03:49:04.380
LIAM: He has some preconceived notions.

03:49:04.380 --> 03:49:07.666
MARISHA: "My scarves are cooler than you."

03:49:07.666 --> 03:49:09.306
MATT: Once we get him like a proper

03:49:09.306 --> 03:49:10.505
plus two enchanted scarf.

03:49:10.505 --> 03:49:12.528
ASHLEY: Can we ship Grog and Vex?

03:49:12.528 --> 03:49:15.142
TRAVIS: Grog and Vex.

03:49:15.142 --> 03:49:18.889
No, I'm here to annoy Vex
by smacking her bear around,

03:49:18.889 --> 03:49:22.744
and she's here to tell
me not to kill myself.

03:49:22.744 --> 03:49:25.484
"Don't jump into the crevasse,
it's 1000 feet deep."

03:49:25.484 --> 03:49:27.442
ASHLEY: Troy Baker is Pike's distanced dad.

03:49:27.442 --> 03:49:29.282
(all laugh)

03:49:29.282 --> 03:49:31.245
MATT: That's pretty funny.

03:49:31.245 --> 03:49:32.641
LIAM: Answer this question I like,

03:49:32.641 --> 03:49:33.474
I saw it a couple times,

03:49:33.474 --> 03:49:35.593
how did you guys get involved in streaming

03:49:35.593 --> 03:49:37.093
for Geek &amp;amp; Sundry?

03:49:38.122 --> 03:49:39.023
TRAVIS: Virgin sacrifice.

03:49:39.023 --> 03:49:41.137
MATT: The best way I know that happened was,

03:49:41.137 --> 03:49:42.145
we had been playing for a while,

03:49:42.145 --> 03:49:44.812
and we all work in the industry.

03:49:46.040 --> 03:49:49.676
People began to hear about
our voiceover D&amp;amp;D game,

03:49:49.676 --> 03:49:50.509
weirdly.

03:49:50.509 --> 03:49:51.540
Like I'd come into sessions with directors

03:49:51.540 --> 03:49:52.814
I've never worked with
before, they'd be like,

03:49:52.814 --> 03:49:55.277
"Oh yeah, you're the guy
that runs that D&amp;amp;D game."

03:49:55.277 --> 03:49:57.376
How did that happen? How is that my thing?

03:49:57.376 --> 03:49:58.687
I'm cool with it, like heck yeah,

03:49:58.687 --> 03:50:00.295
my little high school self is like,

03:50:00.295 --> 03:50:02.635
I'm okay with being known about that.

03:50:02.635 --> 03:50:06.530
But then over time eventually
Geek &amp;amp; Sundry contacted us.

03:50:06.530 --> 03:50:08.661
Felicia had heard about it.

03:50:08.661 --> 03:50:10.003
They called me in for a meeting,

03:50:10.003 --> 03:50:11.350
and we spent a number of months

03:50:11.350 --> 03:50:12.937
trying to figure out what
format we were gonna try,

03:50:12.937 --> 03:50:14.584
if we wanna do it like multi camera,

03:50:14.584 --> 03:50:15.740
filmed canned episodes,

03:50:15.740 --> 03:50:17.224
then eventually the Twitch
possibility came up,

03:50:17.224 --> 03:50:18.057
and we were like no,

03:50:18.057 --> 03:50:20.003
this is a much better format for us.

03:50:20.003 --> 03:50:21.645
And that's kind of how it happened.

03:50:21.645 --> 03:50:24.477
LIAM: Are you kosher with me,

03:50:24.477 --> 03:50:26.494
you took this film, there's a video of you

03:50:26.494 --> 03:50:28.462
breaking the news to us that Geek &amp;amp; Sundry

03:50:28.462 --> 03:50:29.482
came to you about it.

03:50:29.482 --> 03:50:31.056
Are you kosher with me sharing that video?

03:50:31.056 --> 03:50:32.108
MATT: Yeah, I don't see why not.

03:50:32.108 --> 03:50:33.625
LIAM: All right, I'll find a way to put it

03:50:33.625 --> 03:50:35.497
through my Twitter.

03:50:35.497 --> 03:50:37.530
So just keep your eye on my Twitter.

03:50:37.530 --> 03:50:38.549
ASHLEY: Wait, what are you sharing?

03:50:38.549 --> 03:50:40.445
LIAM: There was a video that Orion took

03:50:40.445 --> 03:50:45.018
when Matt told us about
Geek &amp;amp; Sundry coming to him.

03:50:45.018 --> 03:50:48.788
And us all sort of toasting and laughing.

03:50:48.788 --> 03:50:49.621
ORION: Reacting.

03:50:49.621 --> 03:50:51.538
LIAM: Giggling like idiots.

03:50:52.503 --> 03:50:54.173
MATT: Why is D&amp;amp;D Pathfinder
making you so much more

03:50:54.173 --> 03:50:55.962
attached to the characters
than a regular RPG?

03:50:55.962 --> 03:50:57.830
If you mean like a video game RPG?

03:50:57.830 --> 03:50:59.661
I mean you get attached either way,

03:50:59.661 --> 03:51:02.139
but with this, because you
are so much more fluid,

03:51:02.139 --> 03:51:03.820
with how you can influence the world,

03:51:03.820 --> 03:51:05.880
and the character, and the
way the character reacts

03:51:05.880 --> 03:51:10.006
to the world and how it can
influence it is so much more--

03:51:10.006 --> 03:51:10.839
MARISHA: Personal.

03:51:10.839 --> 03:51:13.296
MATT: Personal, a good way of putting it.

03:51:13.296 --> 03:51:14.489
It's just that much more involving,

03:51:14.489 --> 03:51:17.056
and you invest so much
into that atmosphere.

03:51:17.056 --> 03:51:18.431
And it depends on the group,

03:51:18.431 --> 03:51:19.841
some people just like to do dungeon crawls,

03:51:19.841 --> 03:51:21.179
and kill and get loot and experience,

03:51:21.179 --> 03:51:23.512
and that's totally cool too.

03:51:24.392 --> 03:51:25.486
For me at least.

03:51:25.486 --> 03:51:27.982
I like 'em both for different reasons.

03:51:27.982 --> 03:51:30.443
I still play the crap
out of video game RPGs.

03:51:30.443 --> 03:51:32.690
LIAM: Someone asked if given the chance,

03:51:32.690 --> 03:51:35.273
would we like to do a live game

03:51:37.264 --> 03:51:40.807
at a convention like Acquisition Inc.?

03:51:40.807 --> 03:51:43.081
I'd like to do, although
there's nine of us,

03:51:43.081 --> 03:51:44.360
so that'd be kind of--

03:51:44.360 --> 03:51:45.775
ASHLEY: That'd be a long game.

03:51:45.775 --> 03:51:49.032
ZAC: We may be asking
you guys to do that soon.

03:51:49.032 --> 03:51:50.187
LIAM: Oh good, then yes.

03:51:50.187 --> 03:51:52.566
MATT: As long as you're handling the tech,

03:51:52.566 --> 03:51:54.173
I think we'd be fine with that.

03:51:54.173 --> 03:51:55.283
LIAM: I'd like to do it.

03:51:55.283 --> 03:51:57.850
ZAC: We may be streaming from Comic Con,

03:51:57.850 --> 03:51:58.793
I don't know.

03:51:58.793 --> 03:52:00.313
We may be asking if you guys are gonna

03:52:00.313 --> 03:52:02.248
go through that hell hole.

03:52:03.503 --> 03:52:05.037
LIAM: The answer is yes.

03:52:05.037 --> 03:52:07.870
ORION: Can we get a jib? I like crane shots.

03:52:07.870 --> 03:52:08.758
MARISHA: Ooh.

03:52:10.156 --> 03:52:11.872
ASHLEY: A helicopter? A helicopter shot.

03:52:11.872 --> 03:52:12.712
ORION: Put it on the wishlist.

03:52:12.712 --> 03:52:14.433
ZAC: Put it on the wishlist, a jib.

03:52:17.131 --> 03:52:18.623
LIAM: How many of you aside from Matt

03:52:18.623 --> 03:52:21.790
have run a game of D&amp;amp;D or another RPG?

03:52:22.778 --> 03:52:25.580
In high school I ran a D&amp;amp;D game,

03:52:25.580 --> 03:52:28.498
I ran a Rifts game for a little while.

03:52:28.498 --> 03:52:29.581
MATT: Rifts, yes.

03:52:30.715 --> 03:52:33.802
LIAM: I ran a cyberpunk game
for a little while.

03:52:33.802 --> 03:52:34.635
TRAVIS: Really?

03:52:34.635 --> 03:52:35.468
LIAM: Yes.

03:52:36.804 --> 03:52:39.274
The last two months I have been helping

03:52:39.274 --> 03:52:41.127
my eight-year-old son
and two of his friends

03:52:41.127 --> 03:52:42.692
from school create characters.

03:52:42.692 --> 03:52:45.707
And I wouldn't have done this if Matt

03:52:45.707 --> 03:52:48.382
had not forced this shit into my life.

03:52:48.382 --> 03:52:49.544
I wouldn't have done this,

03:52:49.544 --> 03:52:52.350
but I'm about to start
running a game for my son,

03:52:52.350 --> 03:52:54.768
the half-elf druid, and his two friends,

03:52:54.768 --> 03:52:58.771
the dragonborn fighter,
and the dragonborn rogue.

03:52:58.771 --> 03:53:00.168
TRAVIS: What if they die?

03:53:00.168 --> 03:53:02.106
LIAM: That's just how the cookie
crumbles, motherfucker.

03:53:02.106 --> 03:53:04.213
TRAVIS: Oh man, you are teaching life lessons.

03:53:04.213 --> 03:53:05.264
MARISHA: Gotta teach lessons.

03:53:05.264 --> 03:53:06.293
TRAVIS: Go Fish and then D&amp;amp;D.

03:53:06.293 --> 03:53:10.651
TALIESIN: I ran a Rifts game as well in high school.

03:53:10.651 --> 03:53:14.615
Then I ran a game of
Vampire the Masquerade,

03:53:14.615 --> 03:53:16.459
and I was in a bunch of them.

03:53:16.459 --> 03:53:17.938
LIAM: Of course you did.

03:53:17.938 --> 03:53:21.061
TALIESIN: Couple rounds of Paranoia, and Hole,

03:53:21.061 --> 03:53:22.525
because that's funny.

03:53:22.525 --> 03:53:23.510
Hole was amazing.

03:53:23.510 --> 03:53:24.454
MATT: Which you gave me books for.

03:53:24.454 --> 03:53:25.939
For my birthday, which was awesome.

03:53:25.939 --> 03:53:28.467
MARISHA: I was a part of a Buffy the Vampire Slayer

03:53:28.467 --> 03:53:30.388
tabletop RPG for a while.

03:53:30.388 --> 03:53:32.566
Yeah, it's actually quite fun.

03:53:32.566 --> 03:53:34.149
I was a pyromancer.

03:53:35.532 --> 03:53:39.183
ORION: Somebody asked a fun one,
they asked if we play,

03:53:39.183 --> 03:53:41.766
what's our favorite video game?

03:53:42.813 --> 03:53:44.024
MARISHA: What's our favorite video games?

03:53:44.024 --> 03:53:45.802
Oh that's a hard question.

03:53:45.802 --> 03:53:46.635
ORION: Is it?

03:53:46.635 --> 03:53:47.972
MARISHA: There's so many!

03:53:47.972 --> 03:53:48.935
ORION: Well we can skip it.

03:53:48.935 --> 03:53:51.323
LIAM: Metal Gear, Dragon Age.

03:53:51.323 --> 03:53:53.451
ASHLEY: Probably Portal, Portal or Dragon Age.

03:53:53.451 --> 03:53:54.352
MATT: Portal's great.

03:53:54.352 --> 03:53:55.900
LIAM: Castlevania, Symphony of the Night,

03:53:55.900 --> 03:53:57.553
I played 'til I had blisters on my thumbs.

03:53:57.553 --> 03:53:59.253
MATT: Symphony of the Night, yeah, dude.

03:53:59.253 --> 03:54:00.086
What is a man?

03:54:00.086 --> 03:54:01.274
TALIESIN: Borderlands 2, and I'm happy--

03:54:01.274 --> 03:54:03.605
ASHLEY: Borderlands 2.

03:54:03.605 --> 03:54:06.924
LIAM: Pool of Radiance on my Commodore 64.

03:54:06.924 --> 03:54:07.817
ORION: Oh shit.

03:54:07.817 --> 03:54:10.742
LIAM: Baldur's Gate, which I
played again on my iPad

03:54:10.742 --> 03:54:12.242
a year or two ago.

03:54:13.458 --> 03:54:15.331
Somebody, oh go ahead.

03:54:15.331 --> 03:54:17.040
ORION: I was just saying.

03:54:17.040 --> 03:54:19.866
LIAM: Somebody asked how we focus in the room

03:54:19.866 --> 03:54:23.323
with the sexual magnetism
that is Scanlan Shorthalt.

03:54:23.323 --> 03:54:24.651
ASHLEY: Ooh, it's tough man.

03:54:24.651 --> 03:54:25.484
LIAM: I don't know.

03:54:25.484 --> 03:54:26.317
TALIESIN: I wear a codpiece.

03:54:26.317 --> 03:54:28.238
I wear a codpiece that
keeps everything in check.

03:54:28.238 --> 03:54:29.832
MATT: I'm heavily sedated most of the game,

03:54:29.832 --> 03:54:31.102
just for that reason.

03:54:31.102 --> 03:54:32.840
Otherwise the clothes
would just come right off.

03:54:32.840 --> 03:54:35.657
LIAM: I just let myself get a
gigantic boner every week.

03:54:37.591 --> 03:54:39.248
MATT: Does anyone play League?

03:54:39.248 --> 03:54:40.530
Generally.
MARISHA: Sometimes.

03:54:40.530 --> 03:54:42.686
We're playing Heroes
of the Storm more now.

03:54:42.686 --> 03:54:44.229
ORION: I'm a big Final Fantasy fan.

03:54:44.229 --> 03:54:45.922
I like all kinds of games.

03:54:45.922 --> 03:54:49.382
I definitely would say
if I had to pick one RPG,

03:54:49.382 --> 03:54:51.422
cause I'm an RPG guy, I love Chrono Cross,

03:54:51.422 --> 03:54:52.323
that'd be my favorite game.

03:54:52.323 --> 03:54:55.142
I've played that more than
I have Chrono Trigger,

03:54:55.142 --> 03:54:56.338
which is way too many times.

03:54:56.338 --> 03:54:59.255
TRAVIS: Dragon Age race/class.

03:55:00.516 --> 03:55:02.494
Ash, anybody that plays?

03:55:02.494 --> 03:55:03.435
MATT: Elf rogue.

03:55:03.435 --> 03:55:04.829
TALIESIN: Human fighter.

03:55:04.829 --> 03:55:06.372
TRAVIS: Always the mage.

03:55:06.372 --> 03:55:08.821
LIAM: Travis, stupid question, Thor, Odinson,

03:55:08.821 --> 03:55:10.914
or Hulk, in a knock down drag out?

03:55:10.914 --> 03:55:12.274
TRAVIS: Oh (scoffs).

03:55:12.274 --> 03:55:13.895
ORION: Type-0 also, dammit.

03:55:13.895 --> 03:55:16.757
TRAVIS: Contractually, Thor, realistically, Hulk.

03:55:19.617 --> 03:55:22.269
I mean I am Thor, I
can't say any other guy.

03:55:22.269 --> 03:55:23.835
TALIESIN: Hulk's on a scaling power level,

03:55:23.835 --> 03:55:25.685
'cause he just gets too mad.

03:55:25.685 --> 03:55:28.650
TRAVIS: Yeah let's just be real about that.

03:55:28.650 --> 03:55:30.209
That's Hulk.

03:55:30.209 --> 03:55:31.657
MATT: Tried new Final Fantasy yet?

03:55:31.657 --> 03:55:35.157
ASHLEY: ChocolateSweets a bunch of times has asked

03:55:35.157 --> 03:55:38.209
would you guys consider
cosplay for the games?

03:55:38.209 --> 03:55:40.340
TALIESIN: Well technically.

03:55:40.340 --> 03:55:41.194
We already did.

03:55:41.194 --> 03:55:43.694
MARISHA: You'll see, maybe next week?

03:55:44.717 --> 03:55:45.886
MATT: He's trying the best he can.

03:55:45.886 --> 03:55:48.728
We have an intro coming
up some point soon.

03:55:48.728 --> 03:55:49.713
ZAC: Halfway done.

03:55:49.713 --> 03:55:54.266
MATT: Halfway done, we all shot
loosely in character costumes

03:55:54.266 --> 03:55:55.622
inspired by everyone's characters,

03:55:55.622 --> 03:55:56.937
so you'll be able to see that soon.

03:55:56.937 --> 03:55:59.514
TALIESIN: If anyone would like to make us costumes.

03:55:59.514 --> 03:56:01.650
LIAM: One man doing it all.

03:56:01.650 --> 03:56:03.067
TRAVIS: A million arms.

03:56:08.768 --> 03:56:10.413
ASHLEY: I think it would be kinda hard for me

03:56:10.413 --> 03:56:12.785
to play the game in cosplay,

03:56:12.785 --> 03:56:15.408
'cause I have probably the most armor now.

03:56:15.408 --> 03:56:16.420
MATT: You do.

03:56:16.420 --> 03:56:17.412
You wear the most armor.

03:56:18.396 --> 03:56:19.841
ORION: That's a cool question.

03:56:19.841 --> 03:56:21.754
If you had to switch characters Matt,

03:56:21.754 --> 03:56:23.466
if you had to switch characters,

03:56:23.466 --> 03:56:25.383
which one would you be?

03:56:26.637 --> 03:56:28.667
MARISHA: If you had to trade places with one of us?

03:56:28.667 --> 03:56:30.822
ORION: Yeah, if you would switch characters.

03:56:30.822 --> 03:56:31.655
ZAC: That question was Matt included,

03:56:31.655 --> 03:56:32.488
question was for everyone,

03:56:32.488 --> 03:56:34.448
if you guys could switch
characters with anyone,

03:56:34.448 --> 03:56:35.281
who would you pick?

03:56:35.281 --> 03:56:36.531
Including Matt.

03:56:38.043 --> 03:56:41.876
ASHLEY: I would probably switch
with Liam or Travis.

03:56:43.189 --> 03:56:46.864
TALIESIN: Tiberius would be mine, I'd take Tiberius.

03:56:46.864 --> 03:56:49.197
LIAM: Scanlan, I would be Scanlan.

03:56:49.197 --> 03:56:51.068
MATT: I would be Scanlan, bards man.

03:56:51.068 --> 03:56:52.278
Bards are my favorite class.

03:56:52.278 --> 03:56:54.757
MARISHA: I'd be probably either Scanlan or Pike.

03:56:54.757 --> 03:56:55.842
TRAVIS: I'd be Trinket.

03:56:57.455 --> 03:56:58.380
MATT: Yeah you would.

03:57:00.421 --> 03:57:01.806
TRAVIS: Why are you peeing on everything?

03:57:01.806 --> 03:57:03.468
MARISHA: Bards and clerics are great.

03:57:03.468 --> 03:57:05.346
ORION: I'd definitely be Grog.

03:57:05.346 --> 03:57:08.759
Just the complete
opposite of what I can do.

03:57:08.759 --> 03:57:11.782
TALIESIN: I'm a WoW player on occasion,
I haven't played in ages.

03:57:11.782 --> 03:57:13.115
ORION: For the Horde.

03:57:15.776 --> 03:57:17.360
MATT: Player wants to play a lizardfolk monk,

03:57:17.360 --> 03:57:18.911
what's my opinion about the idea?

03:57:18.911 --> 03:57:19.999
That's fine, I mean a player can play

03:57:19.999 --> 03:57:20.832
whatever they want to,

03:57:20.832 --> 03:57:22.885
as long as you as the DM
want it in your campaign.

03:57:22.885 --> 03:57:24.842
Just make sure they have
more to their character

03:57:24.842 --> 03:57:27.754
besides "I'm a lizard monk!"

03:57:27.754 --> 03:57:29.250
have a good reason why
they trained as a monk.

03:57:29.250 --> 03:57:31.340
If they make a cool personality behind it,

03:57:31.340 --> 03:57:32.565
work it into the social structure

03:57:32.565 --> 03:57:34.209
of their lizardfolk people,

03:57:34.209 --> 03:57:36.389
and see whether the monks
will be shunned or accepted,

03:57:36.389 --> 03:57:38.068
are they an outcast of the society?

03:57:38.068 --> 03:57:39.011
Think of those ideas,

03:57:39.011 --> 03:57:40.846
and make a cool character
based on the story,

03:57:40.846 --> 03:57:41.952
from a fighting standpoint?

03:57:41.952 --> 03:57:43.112
That'd be cool.

03:57:43.112 --> 03:57:44.736
I used to play a

03:57:44.736 --> 03:57:48.703
lizard monk in Ruins of Kunark
back in the old EQ days.

03:57:48.703 --> 03:57:50.529
Oh man.

03:57:50.529 --> 03:57:51.362
That was a while back.

03:57:51.362 --> 03:57:53.699
LIAM: Someone asked when
Trinket came into the mix.

03:57:53.699 --> 03:57:54.532
Day one.

03:57:54.532 --> 03:57:55.365
TRAVIS: Day one.

03:57:55.365 --> 03:57:57.614
She had that shit like that.

03:57:57.614 --> 03:57:59.473
She knew she wanted a pet bear.

03:57:59.473 --> 03:58:01.296
MARISHA: He hasn't died yet.

03:58:01.296 --> 03:58:02.427
ORION: He hasn't died, it's amazing,

03:58:02.427 --> 03:58:04.368
this thing has not died.

03:58:04.368 --> 03:58:05.375
He should have died so many times.

03:58:05.375 --> 03:58:06.619
MATT: She spent all of her character focus

03:58:06.619 --> 03:58:08.441
in having a pet from combat,

03:58:08.441 --> 03:58:09.563
and then never puts it in combat,

03:58:09.563 --> 03:58:11.485
because she doesn't want it to get killed,

03:58:11.485 --> 03:58:12.995
and it's fucking hilarious.

03:58:12.995 --> 03:58:14.965
TRAVIS: We put it jeopardy situations before.

03:58:14.965 --> 03:58:16.190
MATT: Yeah, you have.

03:58:16.190 --> 03:58:17.497
Every time she goes, "never again!"

03:58:17.497 --> 03:58:20.217
And I'm like, all right, well.

03:58:20.217 --> 03:58:22.697
TALIESIN: The day that bear dies,
it's gonna get ugly.

03:58:22.697 --> 03:58:23.628
ASHLEY: It's gonna be bad.

03:58:23.628 --> 03:58:27.347
ORION: It's good to change her, as a character.

03:58:27.347 --> 03:58:28.947
TRAVIS: Alignment shift.

03:58:28.947 --> 03:58:30.497
TALIESIN: So much black to wear.

03:58:30.497 --> 03:58:33.199
MARISHA: Douginator asked me a
super detailed question.

03:58:33.199 --> 03:58:35.885
So I don't wanna blow over
it, 'cause it was awesome.

03:58:35.885 --> 03:58:39.289
He asked me how my path has gone,

03:58:39.289 --> 03:58:42.020
and my personal Aramente journey,

03:58:42.020 --> 03:58:44.471
and how working with the group has helped

03:58:44.471 --> 03:58:46.070
and slowed it down.

03:58:46.070 --> 03:58:49.602
For the Air Ashari and
for Keyleth's journey,

03:58:49.602 --> 03:58:53.271
it's kind of expected
to take her maybe ten,

03:58:53.271 --> 03:58:55.090
maybe 20 years?

03:58:55.090 --> 03:58:57.673
It takes her like, the
Aramente is expected

03:58:57.673 --> 03:58:59.097
to take a long time,

03:58:59.097 --> 03:59:01.513
and part of it is her kind
of proving herself a hero.

03:59:01.513 --> 03:59:04.135
So she kind of ended up tagging along

03:59:04.135 --> 03:59:06.885
with this motley crew in order to

03:59:08.272 --> 03:59:11.280
kind of help her so
she's not doing it alone.

03:59:11.280 --> 03:59:13.726
So it's a good thing
that she's tagging along.

03:59:13.726 --> 03:59:17.249
But she also has to deal
with sometimes the moral

03:59:17.249 --> 03:59:21.083
dilemma of maybe choices that she might

03:59:21.083 --> 03:59:23.454
not normally make if she
wasn't with the group

03:59:23.454 --> 03:59:25.574
that she has to go with.

03:59:25.574 --> 03:59:28.124
LIAM: I see two questions I wanna address.

03:59:28.124 --> 03:59:30.896
One is what is each of our favorite kill?

03:59:30.896 --> 03:59:32.445
ORION: I was gonna say that was a good one.

03:59:32.445 --> 03:59:35.408
LIAM: And the second one is
what's the story behind

03:59:35.408 --> 03:59:37.266
the Super High Intensity Team?

03:59:37.266 --> 03:59:39.662
(all laugh)

03:59:39.662 --> 03:59:40.585
LIAM: Let's start with the kills,

03:59:40.585 --> 03:59:42.722
and then we'll get to the SHITs.

03:59:42.722 --> 03:59:46.889
My favorite kill, I finished
off a blue dragon we faced.

03:59:48.527 --> 03:59:51.562
We all chipped away at this dragon,

03:59:51.562 --> 03:59:54.939
someone who had disguised himself as human

03:59:54.939 --> 03:59:59.106
for a long time, then we came
to their secret cubbyhole,

04:00:00.044 --> 04:00:01.561
and they revealed themselves.

04:00:01.561 --> 04:00:02.802
We chipped away and chipped away,

04:00:02.802 --> 04:00:07.117
then at the end I sort
of parkour-ran up a wall

04:00:07.117 --> 04:00:09.280
and shoved the daggers into its neck,

04:00:09.280 --> 04:00:13.447
and just slid down its
entire body and finished it.

04:00:14.979 --> 04:00:17.487
ORION: My favorite kill is actually--

04:00:17.487 --> 04:00:18.320
LIAM: Until today.

04:00:18.320 --> 04:00:20.580
ORION: When Pike kicked the bucket,

04:00:20.580 --> 04:00:24.100
and that moment all of us
realized what happened,

04:00:24.100 --> 04:00:27.440
and there was an instant
shift in real emotion,

04:00:27.440 --> 04:00:29.395
where whatever the hell,

04:00:29.395 --> 04:00:30.783
I don't even remember
who we were fighting,

04:00:30.783 --> 04:00:33.220
because I went like, fucking cast this,

04:00:33.220 --> 04:00:35.601
and everyone's just, kill this thing,

04:00:35.601 --> 04:00:39.630
because we all cared so much
in a real life situation,

04:00:39.630 --> 04:00:43.668
where we hated this
thing, with real emotion,

04:00:43.668 --> 04:00:45.984
and we just slaughtered it.

04:00:45.984 --> 04:00:49.214
TALIESIN: The demon-possessed royal
family was my favorite.

04:00:49.214 --> 04:00:50.261
LIAM: That was the same thing.

04:00:50.261 --> 04:00:52.118
TALIESIN: Yeah, that was my favorite fight.

04:00:52.118 --> 04:00:54.238
Just using the light,
also we were shooting,

04:00:54.238 --> 04:00:56.502
I was getting to shoot
holes in the glass.

04:00:56.502 --> 04:00:58.508
MATT: The entire throne room
had a glass dome overtop,

04:00:58.508 --> 04:01:00.980
but because the family had been possessed

04:01:00.980 --> 04:01:03.900
by the shades, these shadow entities,

04:01:03.900 --> 04:01:05.626
it was all covered.

04:01:05.626 --> 04:01:07.500
They were able to force these spirits

04:01:07.500 --> 04:01:09.713
out of the physical bodies
without killing them

04:01:09.713 --> 04:01:11.571
by being able to tear off the cloth

04:01:11.571 --> 04:01:13.372
or shoot holes in it to allow sunlight in

04:01:13.372 --> 04:01:14.667
and use that as part of the battle tactic,

04:01:14.667 --> 04:01:15.601
it worked out really cool.

04:01:15.601 --> 04:01:16.692
MARISHA: Yeah, that was fun.

04:01:16.692 --> 04:01:18.113
TRAVIS: My favorite kill wasn't even an enemy,

04:01:18.113 --> 04:01:19.954
it was when Scanlan summoned that pony,

04:01:19.954 --> 04:01:21.817
when we were facing those five wizards.

04:01:21.817 --> 04:01:22.893
(all laugh)

04:01:22.893 --> 04:01:23.844
TRAVIS: He summoned this pony,

04:01:23.844 --> 04:01:27.029
and then I turned and abruptly
cut its fucking head off,

04:01:27.029 --> 04:01:29.099
and reached in and grabbed its organs,

04:01:29.099 --> 04:01:31.412
and smeared its gore all over myself,

04:01:31.412 --> 04:01:32.892
and started screaming.

04:01:34.237 --> 04:01:36.570
And Mercer was like, "okay."

04:01:38.223 --> 04:01:39.056
ORION: The fight ended there.

04:01:39.056 --> 04:01:41.889
MATT: Roll intimidation, with a bonus.

04:01:44.481 --> 04:01:46.687
TRAVIS: Butchered a pony for intimidation.

04:01:46.687 --> 04:01:48.162
MATT: Yeah, it worked.

04:01:48.162 --> 04:01:50.737
MARISHA: I think one of my
favorite Keyleth moments,

04:01:50.737 --> 04:01:52.751
it wasn't a kill,

04:01:52.751 --> 04:01:56.812
but when we were in the
crazy, Michael Jackson,

04:01:56.812 --> 04:02:01.505
Neverland Ranch, sorcerer
dude's plane of existence.

04:02:01.505 --> 04:02:03.009
MATT: The Dread Emperor.

04:02:03.009 --> 04:02:04.965
MARISHA: Yeah, when we were in
his plane of existence,

04:02:04.965 --> 04:02:08.858
and we encountered that
big tree rock monster,

04:02:08.858 --> 04:02:11.246
and I just happened to
take Command Plants,

04:02:11.246 --> 04:02:13.279
and he happened to be a plant monster,

04:02:13.279 --> 04:02:14.629
so it just worked out perfectly,

04:02:14.629 --> 04:02:17.043
and I was just like, "we
don't wanna fight you!

04:02:17.043 --> 04:02:18.575
"back down."

04:02:18.575 --> 04:02:20.516
and avoided an entire battle.

04:02:20.516 --> 04:02:22.714
TALIESIN: Getting the magic carpet
was also pretty badass.

04:02:22.714 --> 04:02:25.660
MARISHA: Oh yeah, that was a good story.

04:02:25.660 --> 04:02:29.111
LIAM: Another fabulous moment that
you guys have to know about

04:02:29.111 --> 04:02:33.687
is we wanted to get into
a tower at one point,

04:02:33.687 --> 04:02:36.436
and there was a very intelligent sort of

04:02:36.436 --> 04:02:39.540
right-hand man to whoever owned the tower.

04:02:39.540 --> 04:02:41.502
Scanlan just started fast-talking,

04:02:41.502 --> 04:02:43.681
which is his defining characteristic.

04:02:43.681 --> 04:02:46.012
Took his finger and put it
right here as a mustache,

04:02:46.012 --> 04:02:48.470
and said, "hi, I'm Burt Reynolds."

04:02:48.470 --> 04:02:50.152
(all laugh)

04:02:50.152 --> 04:02:53.402
LIAM: And he rolled, either
Scanlan rolled a 20--

04:02:53.402 --> 04:02:55.214
TRAVIS: I think it was a natural.

04:02:55.214 --> 04:02:56.735
MATT: He rolled a natural 20.

04:02:56.735 --> 04:02:58.369
LIAM: And you weren't expecting it to work,

04:02:58.369 --> 04:03:00.864
in any way, shape, or form, and you went,

04:03:00.864 --> 04:03:01.697
"okay."

04:03:02.905 --> 04:03:04.723
TRAVIS: Mr. Reynolds.

04:03:04.723 --> 04:03:06.398
MARISHA: Burt Reynolds just announced that he's

04:03:06.398 --> 04:03:08.767
gonna be at Philly Wizard World with us,

04:03:08.767 --> 04:03:11.391
so we could theoretically
tell him that story.

04:03:11.391 --> 04:03:12.391
MATT: I have to.

04:03:13.433 --> 04:03:15.382
ASHLEY: Burt Reynolds would be a dream guest.

04:03:17.232 --> 04:03:18.327
ORION: Him and Tom Hanks.

04:03:18.327 --> 04:03:20.339
TRAVIS: He'd have to play on a bearskin carpet.

04:03:20.339 --> 04:03:23.422
MATT: The whole family history organized.

04:03:24.572 --> 04:03:26.687
ASHLEY: I've only had one kill.

04:03:26.687 --> 04:03:28.105
TRAVIS: But, it was what?

04:03:28.105 --> 04:03:29.519
ASHLEY: And it was a dragon.

04:03:29.519 --> 04:03:30.873
TRAVIS: Yeah, dragonslayer.

04:03:30.873 --> 04:03:33.235
ASHLEY: But the thing that I,

04:03:33.235 --> 04:03:37.249
probably the whole battle with the family

04:03:37.249 --> 04:03:39.695
that was sort of possessed
when I actually died,

04:03:39.695 --> 04:03:42.571
that was probably one
of my favorite battles.

04:03:42.571 --> 04:03:45.321
Maybe not after I died, prior to.

04:03:47.311 --> 04:03:50.002
When I got to finish off the dragon--

04:03:50.002 --> 04:03:52.038
TALIESIN: Was that on Christmas?

04:03:52.038 --> 04:03:53.946
ASHLEY: The dragon? Yes.

04:03:53.946 --> 04:03:57.491
That night was so amazing because we had,

04:03:57.491 --> 04:03:59.672
we made it a winter festival.

04:03:59.672 --> 04:04:02.172
So we all came in our pajamas.

04:04:04.460 --> 04:04:06.746
It was close to Christmas,

04:04:06.746 --> 04:04:07.967
that's why it was a winter festival.

04:04:07.967 --> 04:04:10.171
It was like our little Christmas party.

04:04:10.171 --> 04:04:11.121
MARISHA: Our holiday episode.

04:04:11.121 --> 04:04:13.523
LIAM: That was sad for me because it was my idea

04:04:13.523 --> 04:04:15.204
but I had health problems at the time

04:04:15.204 --> 04:04:16.448
and I had to bow out,

04:04:16.448 --> 04:04:18.595
and I was very, very, very sad.

04:04:18.595 --> 04:04:20.235
MATT: But you made it to this year's.

04:04:20.235 --> 04:04:23.009
I made it the following year, yeah.

04:04:23.009 --> 04:04:25.008
TALIESIN: Yeah, we had a whole little
thing, it was really nice.

04:04:25.008 --> 04:04:29.117
MATT: I would love to play D&amp;amp;D
with Dame Judy Dench.

04:04:29.117 --> 04:04:29.950
MARISHA: Heck yeah.

04:04:29.950 --> 04:04:31.976
MATT: You guys can tweet at her
so you can get her to agree.

04:04:31.976 --> 04:04:32.809
LIAM: The SHITs.

04:04:32.809 --> 04:04:33.690
How did we become the SHITs?

04:04:33.690 --> 04:04:35.202
MATT: Yes.

04:04:35.202 --> 04:04:37.535
So the party had run into a,

04:04:39.038 --> 04:04:42.329
debearded, actually, shaven
dwarf named Grimthorn,

04:04:42.329 --> 04:04:44.039
who wanted to represent them for,

04:04:44.039 --> 04:04:47.801
what is occasionally, a
roving brawling guild,

04:04:47.801 --> 04:04:48.700
essentially.

04:04:48.700 --> 04:04:50.809
Like underground fighting
rings that happen

04:04:50.809 --> 04:04:53.001
around the world at different
points throughout the year.

04:04:53.001 --> 04:04:55.643
It may come up again, we'll see.

04:04:55.643 --> 04:04:59.156
But they had to think of a team name.

04:04:59.156 --> 04:05:00.613
And Scanlan.

04:05:01.621 --> 04:05:03.638
Recommended the Super
High Intensity Team.

04:05:03.638 --> 04:05:07.305
Which stuck for a while,
so the group name,

04:05:07.305 --> 04:05:09.408
against the better judgement of, I think,

04:05:09.408 --> 04:05:12.605
a lot of the group, became The SHITs.

04:05:12.605 --> 04:05:13.969
So their name for a while was The SHITs,

04:05:13.969 --> 04:05:15.362
they were announced as
The SHITs in the ring,

04:05:15.362 --> 04:05:16.232
when they won the tournament.

04:05:16.232 --> 04:05:17.653
That was when the pony was cut in half,

04:05:17.653 --> 04:05:19.354
to intimidate the opposing team.

04:05:19.354 --> 04:05:20.335
TRAVIS: Scanlan's idea also.

04:05:20.335 --> 04:05:22.859
ORION: Tiberius and Keyleth were not happy.

04:05:22.859 --> 04:05:24.175
MATT: SHITs stuck for a while until eventually

04:05:24.175 --> 04:05:25.257
they got rid of the SHITs,

04:05:25.257 --> 04:05:27.727
as all of a sudden they
were about to go to the

04:05:27.727 --> 04:05:30.681
winter festival parade in their honor

04:05:30.681 --> 04:05:32.558
for saving the entire city of Eman,

04:05:32.558 --> 04:05:33.951
and the Sovereign Uriel said,

04:05:33.951 --> 04:05:35.702
"what should we announce you as?"

04:05:35.702 --> 04:05:37.738
and it was decided not
to announce you guys

04:05:37.738 --> 04:05:39.591
in front of the city at
your parade as The SHITs.

04:05:39.591 --> 04:05:41.962
ASHLEY: I was super into it.

04:05:41.962 --> 04:05:44.085
Still love The SHITs.

04:05:44.085 --> 04:05:45.935
MATT: Instead the name became Vox Machina.

04:05:45.935 --> 04:05:47.153
So if you've heard them say that,

04:05:47.153 --> 04:05:48.749
that's the official team name

04:05:48.749 --> 04:05:50.278
they've created for themselves as a group.

04:05:50.278 --> 04:05:52.406
ORION: With credit to Sam as well,

04:05:52.406 --> 04:05:54.823
which was voted down was also

04:05:56.564 --> 04:05:58.064
the Brotherhood of the Sisterhood.

04:05:58.064 --> 04:05:58.955
Which I was a huge fan of.

04:05:59.832 --> 04:06:02.196
I really wanted it to be the
Brotherhood of the Sisterhood.

04:06:02.196 --> 04:06:03.877
But Vox Machina sounded cooler.

04:06:03.877 --> 04:06:05.608
ASHLEY: The Brotherhood of the
Sisterhood of the Order,

04:06:05.608 --> 04:06:07.167
or something like that?

04:06:07.167 --> 04:06:10.401
MARISHA: The Order of the Brotherhood
of the Sisterhood.

04:06:10.401 --> 04:06:12.272
ORION: So Tiberius recognizes as the

04:06:12.272 --> 04:06:14.990
Vox Machina/Brotherhood of the Sisterhood.

04:06:14.990 --> 04:06:17.501
LIAM: LargoSensei keeps asking,

04:06:17.501 --> 04:06:22.128
what are your most cathartic
voice acting experiences?

04:06:22.128 --> 04:06:23.942
I'm gonna guess for Ashley
that's The Last of Us,

04:06:23.942 --> 04:06:26.449
since that's your fucking
heart ripped out of your chest.

04:06:26.449 --> 04:06:27.866
ASHLEY: Probably, yeah.

04:06:29.073 --> 04:06:32.313
LIAM: Gollum was pretty sad for me,

04:06:32.313 --> 04:06:33.626
because he's a miserable bastard.

04:06:33.626 --> 04:06:36.318
Also Angel from Wolverine, the X-Men.

04:06:36.318 --> 04:06:38.098
ORION: Wait, does cathartic mean sad?

04:06:38.098 --> 04:06:42.281
LIAM: Well it just means get
your fucking demons out.

04:06:42.281 --> 04:06:43.931
Chew it up.

04:06:43.931 --> 04:06:45.315
TALIESIN: Mine's really old,

04:06:45.315 --> 04:06:49.086
it's probably either
Monster or Paranoia Agent.

04:06:49.086 --> 04:06:51.107
I'm gonna go that far back.

04:06:51.107 --> 04:06:53.152
Yeah, all the way back.

04:06:53.152 --> 04:06:54.682
MATT: Fate Zero for me had a moment

04:06:54.682 --> 04:06:56.879
that was pretty intense emotionally,

04:06:56.879 --> 04:06:59.390
that I really enjoyed.

04:06:59.390 --> 04:07:01.500
TRAVIS: Knuckles the Echidna in Sonic.

04:07:01.500 --> 04:07:03.589
(all laugh)

04:07:03.589 --> 04:07:04.799
MATT: Sonic Boom, yo.

04:07:04.799 --> 04:07:06.382
MARISHA: Boom, Sonic Boom.

04:07:08.063 --> 04:07:08.896
TRAVIS: What's that?

04:07:08.896 --> 04:07:09.960
LIAM: Infamous, maybe?

04:07:09.960 --> 04:07:11.171
TRAVIS: Oh, yeah.

04:07:11.171 --> 04:07:13.431
LIAM: Pretty fucking sad.

04:07:13.431 --> 04:07:14.986
TRAVIS: Brothers. Brotherhood.

04:07:14.986 --> 04:07:16.042
Brotherly love.

04:07:16.042 --> 04:07:19.590
ORION: I'd say for me it was doing Type-0.

04:07:19.590 --> 04:07:23.807
Not so much the actual lines,
'cause I had a lot of fun.

04:07:23.807 --> 04:07:26.568
I don't know if that's cathartic, but.

04:07:26.568 --> 04:07:30.068
Completing an actual real life dream goal.

04:07:32.177 --> 04:07:33.800
I've said this a couple times before,

04:07:33.800 --> 04:07:37.381
but the last day I was
recording the last stuff,

04:07:37.381 --> 04:07:39.580
I was literally crying on the way home,

04:07:39.580 --> 04:07:42.738
because I finally got to level myself up.

04:07:42.738 --> 04:07:45.037
And this thing kept it up,
and it was really cool.

04:07:45.037 --> 04:07:46.311
TRAVIS: Matt, who were you in Fate-0?

04:07:46.311 --> 04:07:48.767
MATT: I'm Kiritsugu, Kiritsugu Emiya.

04:07:48.767 --> 04:07:49.600
TRAVIS: Bless you.

04:07:49.600 --> 04:07:50.433
MATT: Thank you.

04:07:51.449 --> 04:07:52.681
That's the dark assassin character.

04:07:52.681 --> 04:07:53.957
TALIESIN: Saw a question about Percy's home,

04:07:53.957 --> 04:07:55.032
and his family.

04:07:55.032 --> 04:07:56.590
Percy has a really really big family,

04:07:56.590 --> 04:07:58.277
that I don't mention in the video,

04:07:58.277 --> 04:08:01.211
and he has not been home yet.

04:08:01.211 --> 04:08:03.112
He has no interest in going home yet,

04:08:03.112 --> 04:08:04.969
'cause that's terrifying.

04:08:04.969 --> 04:08:06.672
So we have not dealt with that.

04:08:06.672 --> 04:08:08.301
MATT: That's going to be interesting
when that comes around.

04:08:08.301 --> 04:08:10.168
TRAVIS: What's under the freakin' lake?

04:08:10.168 --> 04:08:11.626
LIAM: What's under the freakin' lake, Matt?

04:08:11.626 --> 04:08:12.832
MARISHA: Yeah, what's under the lake?

04:08:12.832 --> 04:08:14.659
MATT: You were told.

04:08:14.659 --> 04:08:16.781
ORION: Yeah, it's one of those big--

04:08:16.781 --> 04:08:17.614
MATT: Aboleth.

04:08:17.614 --> 04:08:19.546
MARISHA: Oh yeah that's right, I did write it down.

04:08:19.546 --> 04:08:22.385
MATT: Which you encountered one underground.

04:08:22.385 --> 04:08:24.885
MARISHA: Yes, I was a shark.

04:08:24.885 --> 04:08:27.042
MATT: Put the slime into the water.

04:08:27.042 --> 04:08:29.013
You could only breathe water
and couldn't breathe air.

04:08:29.013 --> 04:08:30.007
MARISHA: Remember, 'cause I was like,

04:08:30.007 --> 04:08:32.746
"I'm gonna be crafty
and turn into a shark,"

04:08:32.746 --> 04:08:35.508
and then I started immediately drowning.

04:08:35.508 --> 04:08:39.215
ORION: How do you keep players
from getting OP, Matt?

04:08:39.215 --> 04:08:41.751
MATT: Make the monsters more powerful.

04:08:41.751 --> 04:08:43.710
ORION: Behind the scenes,

04:08:43.710 --> 04:08:46.140
I'm always constantly up his ass,

04:08:46.140 --> 04:08:48.162
trying to make Tiberius as OP as possible,

04:08:48.162 --> 04:08:50.020
and he's always stopping me a lot.

04:08:50.020 --> 04:08:51.937
MATT: Balance is important.

04:08:53.125 --> 04:08:54.288
I mean, the characters,

04:08:54.288 --> 04:08:55.770
everyone here has really good characters

04:08:55.770 --> 04:08:56.965
that have a lot of cool abilities,

04:08:56.965 --> 04:08:59.376
but they also have a lot of challenges

04:08:59.376 --> 04:09:00.635
that come at them that make them,

04:09:00.635 --> 04:09:03.011
not only use those abilities, but also,

04:09:03.011 --> 04:09:04.810
monsters can have cool abilities too.

04:09:04.810 --> 04:09:07.633
LIAM: Bracheon89, you said
Stephen King plays D&amp;amp;D?

04:09:07.633 --> 04:09:08.866
ASHLEY: Yes, that's what I was trying to say.

04:09:08.866 --> 04:09:10.011
What?

04:09:10.011 --> 04:09:11.534
LIAM: Bracheon, we're going
to wait for your answer.

04:09:11.534 --> 04:09:12.869
How do you know he plays D&amp;amp;D?

04:09:12.869 --> 04:09:13.702
ASHLEY: Are you sure?

04:09:13.702 --> 04:09:14.535
LIAM: Let's get him in here.

04:09:14.535 --> 04:09:15.702
MATT: I'd love that.

04:09:16.571 --> 04:09:19.899
TALIESIN: The group's worst decision
in D&amp;amp;D was the dragon,

04:09:19.899 --> 04:09:21.374
I think.

04:09:21.374 --> 04:09:22.527
MARISHA: Oh yeah, Grog?

04:09:22.527 --> 04:09:23.360
TALIESIN: Grog.

04:09:23.360 --> 04:09:25.102
TRAVIS: Listen, there was a shitload of gold.

04:09:25.102 --> 04:09:27.427
ASHLEY: I still don't think that was a bad idea.

04:09:27.427 --> 04:09:28.801
ORION: Oh, when he started hoarding all the gold?

04:09:28.801 --> 04:09:29.912
MARISHA: We still don't know if that--

04:09:29.912 --> 04:09:30.745
LIAM: Takes a lot of stupid.

04:09:30.745 --> 04:09:32.129
MARISHA: He might have been an ally.

04:09:32.129 --> 04:09:34.774
We might have killed
someone who was valuable.

04:09:34.774 --> 04:09:37.365
TALIESIN: You were still freaking
out like a month later,

04:09:37.365 --> 04:09:38.746
you were feeling really bad.

04:09:38.746 --> 04:09:40.342
TRAVIS: Well, I did almost get us killed.

04:09:40.342 --> 04:09:41.175
ASHLEY: I feel like it was a good decision.

04:09:41.175 --> 04:09:42.008
MATT: To be fair,

04:09:42.008 --> 04:09:43.505
it's the only time I've ever had a player

04:09:43.505 --> 04:09:44.962
rage loot before.

04:09:44.962 --> 04:09:46.304
(all laugh)

04:09:46.304 --> 04:09:49.278
MATT: You went into a rage, and
used it to just loot more.

04:09:49.278 --> 04:09:51.093
And then the dragon revealed itself,

04:09:51.093 --> 04:09:52.218
and you looked at it,

04:09:52.218 --> 04:09:53.353
and you just kept looting.

04:09:53.353 --> 04:09:56.044
(all laugh)

04:09:56.044 --> 04:09:57.929
TRAVIS: You guys take care of this.

04:09:57.929 --> 04:09:59.141
ASHLEY: That was hilarious.
MATT: That's Grog.

04:09:59.141 --> 04:10:00.416
LIAM: Somebody keeps asking,

04:10:00.416 --> 04:10:01.996
and we'll do a show of hands here,

04:10:01.996 --> 04:10:04.338
Lord of the Rings or Game of Thrones?

04:10:04.338 --> 04:10:05.630
ASHLEY: Oh, come on.

04:10:05.630 --> 04:10:06.686
MARISHA: Ooh, that's tough.

04:10:06.686 --> 04:10:07.519
LIAM: What do you prefer?

04:10:07.519 --> 04:10:09.378
10 seconds to think
about it, and then I'll--

04:10:09.378 --> 04:10:10.634
TALIESIN: That's like Star Trek or Star Wars.

04:10:10.634 --> 04:10:12.378
MARISHA: Yeah, hard.

04:10:12.378 --> 04:10:13.446
LIAM: They're asking the question.

04:10:13.446 --> 04:10:15.301
ZAC: Don't be afraid, come on.

04:10:15.301 --> 04:10:16.134
TRAVIS: That's tough.

04:10:16.134 --> 04:10:19.163
LIAM: Lord of the Rings,
fuckin' Lord of the Rings.

04:10:19.163 --> 04:10:21.659
There you go, there's the answer.

04:10:21.659 --> 04:10:23.782
ASHLEY: I don't know, man.

04:10:23.782 --> 04:10:25.399
TALIESIN: Lord of the Rings, but
I see Game of Thrones on the side.

04:10:25.399 --> 04:10:26.629
LIAM: I love Game of Thrones.

04:10:26.629 --> 04:10:27.475
MARISHA: Of course we do.

04:10:27.475 --> 04:10:28.964
TRAVIS: Lord of the Rings.

04:10:28.964 --> 04:10:30.159
TALIESIN: We wouldn't have Game of Thrones

04:10:30.159 --> 04:10:31.225
without Lord of the Rings.

04:10:31.225 --> 04:10:32.058
MARISHA: That's the thing.

04:10:32.058 --> 04:10:34.254
LIAM: Maybe possibly not Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons

04:10:34.254 --> 04:10:35.495
without Lord of the Rings.

04:10:35.495 --> 04:10:38.297
ASHLEY: This is true, it's the OG.

04:10:38.297 --> 04:10:39.741
I don't know what that even--

04:10:39.741 --> 04:10:40.902
TALIESIN: You said that.

04:10:40.902 --> 04:10:42.122
That just came out of your mouth.

04:10:42.122 --> 04:10:44.435
ASHLEY: Please let's leave it alone.

04:10:44.435 --> 04:10:45.482
Moving on.

04:10:45.482 --> 04:10:46.315
TRAVIS: That's the OG.

04:10:46.315 --> 04:10:48.556
ASHLEY: What is this, what do we have over here?

04:10:48.556 --> 04:10:50.596
Well, who was the old gnome that Grog saved

04:10:50.596 --> 04:10:51.858
in his intro video?

04:10:51.858 --> 04:10:52.691
LIAM: Pike's daddy.

04:10:52.691 --> 04:10:54.637
ASHLEY: No, that was my great great grandfather.

04:10:54.637 --> 04:10:55.917
TRAVIS: That's right.

04:10:55.917 --> 04:10:58.001
ASHLEY: Yes, great great grandfather Wilhand.

04:10:58.001 --> 04:11:00.267
TRAVIS: Wilhelm, hand? Wilhand.

04:11:00.267 --> 04:11:01.100
ASHLEY: That's right.

04:11:01.100 --> 04:11:03.551
LIAM: Wilhand the money.

04:11:06.091 --> 04:11:08.491
TRAVIS: Grog has an intelligence of six,
he's gonna get names wrong from time to time.

04:11:08.491 --> 04:11:12.328
LIAM: Everybody, if you could
choose whatever fantasy world

04:11:12.328 --> 04:11:14.583
to live in, what would it be?

04:11:14.583 --> 04:11:15.810
TRAVIS: Marvel.

04:11:15.810 --> 04:11:16.794
TALIESIN: Ooh.

04:11:16.794 --> 04:11:18.794
ORION: I would live in the...

04:11:19.982 --> 04:11:23.129
Next Generation world, universe.

04:11:23.129 --> 04:11:24.414
TALIESIN: You had me at Marvel.

04:11:24.414 --> 04:11:25.495
TRAVIS: Yeah.

04:11:25.495 --> 04:11:26.580
ZAC: Here's the thing,

04:11:26.580 --> 04:11:28.761
you could live in Marvel what you live in,

04:11:28.761 --> 04:11:31.439
if you couldn't live in
that world as a superhero,

04:11:31.439 --> 04:11:32.832
just as a normal person.

04:11:32.832 --> 04:11:34.803
TRAVIS: Right, not in New York.

04:11:34.803 --> 04:11:36.017
Anybody that lives in New York

04:11:36.017 --> 04:11:37.458
in the Marvel universe is just stupid.

04:11:37.458 --> 04:11:38.822
Like rent's gotta be $1.50.

04:11:38.822 --> 04:11:39.727
TALIESIN: Terrible idea.

04:11:39.727 --> 04:11:41.792
MATT: I'd say Myst.

04:11:41.792 --> 04:11:44.364
So I can just write my own worlds

04:11:44.364 --> 04:11:46.290
to infinity from there.

04:11:46.290 --> 04:11:47.255
LIAM: Lord of the Rings.

04:11:47.255 --> 04:11:48.258
MATT: Or Amber as well.

04:11:48.258 --> 04:11:49.957
ASHLEY: I was gonna say Lord of the Rings.

04:11:49.957 --> 04:11:52.034
Maybe Rivendell.

04:11:52.034 --> 04:11:53.895
MARISHA: I'm gonna say Final Fantasy 10.

04:11:53.895 --> 04:11:54.770
MATT: Grey Havens.

04:11:54.770 --> 04:11:56.431
If you're gonna do Lord of the Rings, do
Grey Havens,

04:11:56.431 --> 04:11:57.735
'cause you're far enough away from Mordor,

04:11:57.735 --> 04:12:00.279
where it's generally
not gonna be a problem.

04:12:00.279 --> 04:12:03.098
LIAM: I wanna be one of the Fellowship.

04:12:03.098 --> 04:12:05.868
Ashley Johnson lived in a
Marvel universe already, right?

04:12:05.868 --> 04:12:06.780
MATT: That's true.

04:12:06.780 --> 04:12:09.096
ORION: See, and it's a big hassle.

04:12:09.096 --> 04:12:10.319
MARISHA: It was a big hassle.

04:12:10.319 --> 04:12:11.526
ORION: Yeah.

04:12:11.526 --> 04:12:13.588
MATT: Before the stream, our D&amp;amp;D session--

04:12:13.588 --> 04:12:15.778
MARISHA: High insurance rates.

04:12:15.778 --> 04:12:16.859
MATT: Before the stream our D&amp;amp;D sessions

04:12:16.859 --> 04:12:19.412
would happen once every
month to month and a half,

04:12:19.412 --> 04:12:20.486
more like month and a half.

04:12:20.486 --> 04:12:21.962
LIAM: Why is Matt Scarlet Witch?

04:12:21.962 --> 04:12:23.545
MATT: I'm down with it.

04:12:24.578 --> 04:12:26.421
'Cause I alter reality.

04:12:26.421 --> 04:12:28.471
Power makes sense.

04:12:28.471 --> 04:12:29.887
Our sessions used to be once every month,

04:12:29.887 --> 04:12:30.745
or month and a half,

04:12:30.745 --> 04:12:34.073
and they would be about
six to eight hours.

04:12:34.073 --> 04:12:35.658
But the problem is we'd
play so infrequently,

04:12:35.658 --> 04:12:38.196
every session I'd have to
remind everyone what happened,

04:12:38.196 --> 04:12:40.037
and it was hard to schedule.

04:12:40.037 --> 04:12:41.291
Part of the reason we're
even doing this show,

04:12:41.291 --> 04:12:42.752
is because it's technically work,

04:12:42.752 --> 04:12:45.097
which allows those of us who have families

04:12:45.097 --> 04:12:48.496
and children more of an
excuse to come more often.

04:12:48.496 --> 04:12:49.329
So yeah.

04:12:51.126 --> 04:12:53.876
LIAM: Googoo17, Arkazey keeps asking,

04:12:55.615 --> 04:12:57.420
what's your favorite
nerdy t-shirt you own?

04:12:57.420 --> 04:12:59.873
Mine is one that says Mordor World Tour,

04:12:59.873 --> 04:13:01.574
it looks like a rock 'n' roll t-shirt,

04:13:01.574 --> 04:13:03.569
but it says Mordor World Tour.

04:13:03.569 --> 04:13:05.031
MARISHA: That's cool.

04:13:05.031 --> 04:13:07.005
Favorite nerdy t-shirt.

04:13:07.005 --> 04:13:10.290
TALIESIN: I've got a Sons of Anarchy
Doctor Who t-shirt,

04:13:10.290 --> 04:13:12.598
I'm a really big fan of.

04:13:12.598 --> 04:13:14.664
I'll wear it next week.

04:13:14.664 --> 04:13:18.544
MARISHA: I've got like an army, kind of soldiery,

04:13:18.544 --> 04:13:23.272
looking t-shirt that says
Chimera, like Chimera Corps.

04:13:23.272 --> 04:13:24.248
MATT: That's actually the one I was gonna say,

04:13:24.248 --> 04:13:26.287
that's my favorite shirt too.

04:13:26.287 --> 04:13:28.096
MARISHA: I like your displacer kitty you've got.

04:13:28.096 --> 04:13:29.391
MATT: Displacer kitty's kind of cool.

04:13:29.391 --> 04:13:30.406
Adorable.

04:13:30.406 --> 04:13:32.509
TALIESIN: I like your shine on me shirt.

04:13:32.509 --> 04:13:33.342
MATT: Oh God.

04:13:33.342 --> 04:13:34.862
If you guys haven't watched.

04:13:35.789 --> 04:13:37.609
Chris Dane Owens, on YouTube,

04:13:37.609 --> 04:13:39.114
Chris Dane Owens, Shine on Me.

04:13:39.114 --> 04:13:40.918
It's a music video, watch it.

04:13:40.918 --> 04:13:44.457
Chris Dane Owens, Shine, or
Shine on Me, YouTube, do it.

04:13:44.457 --> 04:13:45.512
TALIESIN: I love that you own the shirt from it.

04:13:45.512 --> 04:13:47.385
MATT: I bought a shirt from it,
'cause it's that amazing,

04:13:47.385 --> 04:13:48.329
I had to.

04:13:48.329 --> 04:13:49.973
TRAVIS: Did anyone tell Pike that Scanlan

04:13:49.973 --> 04:13:52.272
killed the naga for her?

04:13:52.272 --> 04:13:53.526
MATT: I don't think someone's done it yet.

04:13:53.526 --> 04:13:56.045
LIAM: Scanlan had his first kill.

04:13:56.045 --> 04:13:57.033
You saw it, right?

04:13:57.033 --> 04:13:58.949
MATT: You saw it on the stream.

04:13:58.949 --> 04:14:00.585
ASHLEY: I saw it, me, Ashley saw it,

04:14:00.585 --> 04:14:03.189
but Pike did not hear about it yet.

04:14:03.189 --> 04:14:05.006
Who knows, that could be the thing

04:14:05.006 --> 04:14:06.985
that seals the deal.

04:14:06.985 --> 04:14:08.410
I'll be like, you killed the naga?

04:14:08.410 --> 04:14:09.818
Okay, let's do this.

04:14:09.818 --> 04:14:12.068
(all laugh)

04:14:14.792 --> 04:14:17.441
MARISHA: Any betrayals in the game?

04:14:17.441 --> 04:14:22.040
MATT: No betrayals, disagreements,
and occasional--

04:14:22.040 --> 04:14:23.049
TRAVIS: Trippings and beat-downs.

04:14:23.049 --> 04:14:25.211
MATT: And stealing of flying carpets.

04:14:25.211 --> 04:14:27.044
ASHLEY: I actually did step,

04:14:27.886 --> 04:14:31.077
I kind of did hurt Liam one game.

04:14:31.077 --> 04:14:31.910
Or Vax.

04:14:33.773 --> 04:14:35.213
LIAM: The game we played together?

04:14:35.213 --> 04:14:37.414
We did just the two of us one night.

04:14:37.414 --> 04:14:41.581
ASHLEY: There were some of the
girls changing in a room.

04:14:43.120 --> 04:14:44.091
MATT: I forgot about this.

04:14:44.091 --> 04:14:47.119
LIAM: I was very curious to see you naked.

04:14:47.119 --> 04:14:49.016
But that's kinda fallen on the wayside.

04:14:49.016 --> 04:14:50.317
ASHLEY: Vax was very curious to see

04:14:50.317 --> 04:14:52.607
what a gnome looked like naked.

04:14:52.607 --> 04:14:53.942
LIAM: Never seen it before.

04:14:53.942 --> 04:14:55.143
MARISHA: So you did a little peeping tom?

04:14:55.143 --> 04:14:56.799
LIAM: Why wouldn't I wanna expand my horizons?

04:14:56.799 --> 04:14:57.953
MATT: So he rolled stealth.

04:14:57.953 --> 04:15:00.968
ASHLEY: So he rolled stealth, and
he did, and saw or whatever,

04:15:00.968 --> 04:15:03.286
and then when I came back
out, and I found out about it.

04:15:03.286 --> 04:15:04.838
LIAM: Looked good, it was compact.

04:15:06.285 --> 04:15:08.163
ASHLEY: It was just a small human.

04:15:08.163 --> 04:15:10.013
And I think I stepped on your foot,

04:15:10.013 --> 04:15:11.481
and gave you some damage.

04:15:11.481 --> 04:15:12.314
LIAM: Maybe a hit point.

04:15:12.314 --> 04:15:13.514
ASHLEY: Yeah, a hit point or two.

04:15:13.514 --> 04:15:14.548
MATT: You earned it.

04:15:14.548 --> 04:15:15.423
ASHLEY: I earned it.

04:15:15.423 --> 04:15:17.335
ORION: Somebody, seagullblaster--

04:15:17.335 --> 04:15:19.992
LIAM: No, Vax didn't spy on
Vex, sorry, go ahead.

04:15:19.992 --> 04:15:23.647
ORION: Asked-- Tiberius said something
about the Palestone,

04:15:23.647 --> 04:15:26.555
and what it is, and this is,

04:15:26.555 --> 04:15:27.784
somebody asked a different question,

04:15:27.784 --> 04:15:30.413
this is kinda gonna answer both.

04:15:30.413 --> 04:15:31.739
I, and everybody else,

04:15:31.739 --> 04:15:34.575
wrote backstories for Matthew

04:15:34.575 --> 04:15:39.317
to essentially give him so he
could construct our universe.

04:15:39.317 --> 04:15:41.854
Tiberius' particular quest

04:15:41.854 --> 04:15:45.282
is looking for particular artifacts.

04:15:45.282 --> 04:15:47.737
Essentially I made him like Mulder.

04:15:47.737 --> 04:15:50.145
Nobody believes in the city
that these things exist,

04:15:50.145 --> 04:15:53.139
except him, so the truth
is out there kinda thing.

04:15:53.139 --> 04:15:56.323
So I made up these five
different artifacts

04:15:56.323 --> 04:15:57.383
that do different things.

04:15:57.383 --> 04:15:58.645
And I don't know what they do until

04:15:58.645 --> 04:16:00.992
I might maybe find them, and if I do,

04:16:00.992 --> 04:16:04.789
it's up to him, to Matt,
to determine what they are,

04:16:04.789 --> 04:16:06.437
if they are anything.

04:16:06.437 --> 04:16:07.715
They might be nothing, I don't know.

04:16:07.715 --> 04:16:10.186
I've found one item so
far, and it's awesome,

04:16:10.186 --> 04:16:13.155
and all of us have given him bits and pieces,

04:16:13.155 --> 04:16:15.283
and that's how he constructs our story

04:16:15.283 --> 04:16:17.577
with things that you throw in yourself.

04:16:17.577 --> 04:16:19.437
MATT: Yeah, and each player,

04:16:19.437 --> 04:16:22.381
all their story lines work into the world.

04:16:22.381 --> 04:16:24.692
Not all of them will happen
immediately of course,

04:16:24.692 --> 04:16:27.143
some people have had personal encounters

04:16:27.143 --> 04:16:30.483
and story encounters already,
some are yet to occur,

04:16:30.483 --> 04:16:32.298
and there will be points
throughout the campaign

04:16:32.298 --> 04:16:34.943
where the party will probably have to move

04:16:34.943 --> 04:16:37.846
and individually deal
with each person's story

04:16:37.846 --> 04:16:39.343
to some extent.

04:16:39.343 --> 04:16:42.033
MARISHA: Dealt a little bit with each person.

04:16:42.033 --> 04:16:44.255
MATT: Touched a little bit like--

04:16:44.255 --> 04:16:46.715
In Eman, we've seen Vex and Vax's father.

04:16:46.715 --> 04:16:49.062
LIAM: Vex and I ran into to our father again

04:16:49.062 --> 04:16:50.498
for the first time in many years,

04:16:50.498 --> 04:16:51.874
it was a little frosty.

04:16:51.874 --> 04:16:53.087
MATT: Had a new family.

04:16:53.087 --> 04:16:55.297
LIAM: Have a little half sister.

04:16:55.297 --> 04:16:56.511
TRAVIS: Matt, you have a favorite voice?

04:16:56.511 --> 04:17:00.767
And does it hurt to do
the gnarly monster voice?

04:17:00.767 --> 04:17:02.129
MATT: If you do it for an
extended period of time

04:17:02.129 --> 04:17:03.560
it can be kind of shitty.

04:17:03.560 --> 04:17:05.634
ASHLEY: I don't know how you do this new one.

04:17:05.634 --> 04:17:06.595
TRAVIS: Breathing in and out.

04:17:06.595 --> 04:17:07.895
LIAM: That's inward singing, man.

04:17:07.895 --> 04:17:09.494
TRAVIS: It is inward singing.

04:17:09.494 --> 04:17:11.043
LIAM: And then I'm fucking singing,

04:17:11.043 --> 04:17:14.126
and then--

04:17:19.205 --> 04:17:20.038
MATT: Actually, it's funny,

04:17:20.038 --> 04:17:22.831
a bunch of my NPCs that
I've done since high school

04:17:22.831 --> 04:17:25.962
have ended up turning into
characters I've booked.

04:17:25.962 --> 04:17:27.479
I'll go into an audition and be like,

04:17:27.479 --> 04:17:29.404
"I'll go ahead and do Nutibe Curios,

04:17:29.404 --> 04:17:31.369
"from my Second campaign,"

04:17:31.369 --> 04:17:32.758
and I'll end up doing that character.

04:17:32.758 --> 04:17:36.008
Alof in Pillars is a character I NPCed

04:17:37.855 --> 04:17:38.939
back in high school.

04:17:38.939 --> 04:17:39.772
LIAM: That's awesome.

04:17:39.772 --> 04:17:41.348
TALIESIN: They still haven't heard my favorite voice

04:17:41.348 --> 04:17:42.808
from this campaign yet.

04:17:42.808 --> 04:17:44.739
'Cause we haven't gone
back to the city yet.

04:17:44.951 --> 04:17:47.951
MATT: Oh, Gilmore?

04:17:47.951 --> 04:17:50.790
LIAM: Gilmore is a wonderful
magician who owns a shop.

04:17:51.806 --> 04:17:52.689
ORION: Was that the fancy--

04:17:52.689 --> 04:17:53.699
LIAM: Yes, in the city of Eman,

04:17:53.699 --> 04:17:57.104
he's got a big friggin'
crush on me, and wants me.

04:17:57.104 --> 04:18:00.447
Wants me and some day you
and I will actualize that.

04:18:00.447 --> 04:18:01.355
MATT: We'll have to roleplay that.

04:18:02.738 --> 04:18:03.642
LIAM: Maybe in a game. Maybe not.

04:18:03.642 --> 04:18:07.425
TRAVIS: What do we think is
taking over the hive mind?

04:18:07.425 --> 04:18:09.081
MATT: What do you guys think is
taking over the hive mind?

04:18:09.081 --> 04:18:10.794
MARISHA: Well we know it's named--

04:18:10.794 --> 04:18:11.777
ORION: Obviously some butthole.

04:18:13.539 --> 04:18:15.483
ASHLEY: I think I might have an idea.

04:18:15.483 --> 04:18:16.536
TRAVIS: Yeah, you had a vision that we don't even

04:18:16.536 --> 04:18:18.191
know about yet, right?

04:18:18.191 --> 04:18:19.337
ASHLEY: Well.

04:18:19.337 --> 04:18:23.138
TRAVIS: Taking those mushrooms,
having those visions.

04:18:23.138 --> 04:18:24.795
ASHLEY: Taking those mushrooms.

04:18:24.795 --> 04:18:28.011
LIAM: Someone asked how do game devs find us

04:18:28.011 --> 04:18:29.344
for acting work?

04:18:30.282 --> 04:18:33.194
We all audition, hundreds
of people audition,

04:18:33.194 --> 04:18:37.018
for every role in Los
Angeles, we all just try.

04:18:37.018 --> 04:18:40.734
Today I worked on a superhero game,

04:18:40.734 --> 04:18:43.671
and the guy who was directing
me for voiceover said,

04:18:43.671 --> 04:18:45.048
"hey, so what are you doing
for the rest of the day?"

04:18:45.048 --> 04:18:46.689
And I said, well, I'm gonna go to the gym,

04:18:46.689 --> 04:18:48.378
I'm gonna do this, then
I'm gonna go do that,

04:18:48.378 --> 04:18:49.478
do you know about that D&amp;amp;D show

04:18:49.478 --> 04:18:50.686
that a couple of us are doing?

04:18:50.686 --> 04:18:52.111
And he's like, "yeah, I heard about that."

04:18:52.111 --> 04:18:54.654
And the guy who had written the game went,

04:18:54.654 --> 04:18:56.924
"yeah, I've watched every episode."

04:18:56.924 --> 04:18:58.538
(all laugh)

04:18:58.538 --> 04:19:00.104
MATT: So awesome.

04:19:00.104 --> 04:19:01.521
TALIESIN: That's so cool.

04:19:03.947 --> 04:19:05.912
ASHLEY: Someone wants to hear Gilmore's voice.

04:19:05.912 --> 04:19:07.262
TALIESIN: I think we should save that for,

04:19:07.262 --> 04:19:09.254
wait until they actually meet Gilmore.

04:19:09.254 --> 04:19:11.071
TRAVIS: Yeah, we can't give it away.

04:19:11.071 --> 04:19:12.272
MATT: Gilmore's a fun one.

04:19:12.272 --> 04:19:13.701
ASHLEY: Gilmore's awesome.

04:19:13.701 --> 04:19:15.845
MATT: Gilmore is very Broadway.

04:19:16.803 --> 04:19:18.437
He's very--

04:19:18.437 --> 04:19:19.475
TALIESIN: Not the gargoyle.

04:19:19.475 --> 04:19:20.376
MATT: No, no.

04:19:20.376 --> 04:19:23.128
I could see him being a
character in a John Waters film.

04:19:23.128 --> 04:19:25.073
TALIESIN: Oh my God, yeah.

04:19:25.073 --> 04:19:26.116
ASHLEY: Totally.

04:19:26.116 --> 04:19:27.378
LIAM: Give him a pencil-thin mustache.

04:19:27.378 --> 04:19:28.315
MATT: Yeah.

04:19:32.148 --> 04:19:33.862
TALIESIN: I'm trying to catch up.

04:19:33.862 --> 04:19:35.830
TRAVIS: Greater overall motivations?

04:19:36.757 --> 04:19:37.613
MATT: That may or may not be secret,

04:19:37.613 --> 04:19:39.095
depending on the characters.

04:19:39.095 --> 04:19:43.677
MARISHA: What is each person's
favorite D&amp;amp;D monster?

04:19:43.677 --> 04:19:44.652
TRAVIS: A dead one.

04:19:45.839 --> 04:19:49.172
LIAM: I liked it when Grog got it on with a,

04:19:50.203 --> 04:19:51.458
what was it, a nymph?

04:19:51.458 --> 04:19:52.291
TRAVIS: What?

04:19:52.291 --> 04:19:53.193
MATT: Yeah!

04:19:53.193 --> 04:19:55.127
TRAVIS: You don't know man, I
went through the portal,

04:19:55.127 --> 04:19:57.109
handled my business like a champ.

04:19:57.109 --> 04:19:58.877
LIAM: In the air.

04:19:58.877 --> 04:20:00.309
TRAVIS: I don't kiss and tell.

04:20:00.309 --> 04:20:01.142
Nobody knows.

04:20:01.142 --> 04:20:02.709
I got what we were supposed to get.

04:20:02.709 --> 04:20:04.248
LIAM: A nymph could have attacked us,

04:20:04.248 --> 04:20:05.713
but Grog looked her in the eye,

04:20:05.713 --> 04:20:07.312
and she liked what she saw.

04:20:07.312 --> 04:20:08.883
Then he disappeared for a little while,

04:20:08.883 --> 04:20:11.333
and he came back and he
was in a really good mood.

04:20:11.333 --> 04:20:12.553
TRAVIS: I flashed her the look, man.

04:20:12.553 --> 04:20:13.714
She was mine, what can I say?

04:20:14.647 --> 04:20:17.329
TALIESIN: I like the little green gelatinous cubes.

04:20:17.329 --> 04:20:19.074
I think they're fun, and
then if you make 'em right,

04:20:19.074 --> 04:20:20.082
you can just make 'em out of jello,

04:20:20.082 --> 04:20:23.014
and eat them when you're
done, that's awesome.

04:20:23.014 --> 04:20:25.002
MATT: I don't wanna answer that
question necessarily,

04:20:25.002 --> 04:20:27.032
because I might be using
them in the campaign

04:20:27.032 --> 04:20:27.865
at some point.

04:20:27.865 --> 04:20:28.698
ORION: Which one?

04:20:28.698 --> 04:20:29.626
MATT: Nothing.

04:20:29.626 --> 04:20:31.390
ASHLEY: So that means we haven't used 'em yet.

04:20:31.390 --> 04:20:34.229
MATT: But overall, I just love the tarrasque

04:20:34.229 --> 04:20:35.938
because it's like the game ender.

04:20:35.938 --> 04:20:37.115
It's the godzilla.

04:20:37.115 --> 04:20:38.836
It's the one DM's move where he's like,

04:20:38.836 --> 04:20:40.236
"I'm done with this campaign, hey guys,

04:20:40.236 --> 04:20:41.783
"you're gonna fight a tarrasque,
either you're all gonna die,

04:20:41.783 --> 04:20:43.732
"or you beat it, and you beat the game!"

04:20:43.732 --> 04:20:45.392
So the tarrassque is always fun.

04:20:45.392 --> 04:20:47.588
ORION: Is it the final boss?

04:20:47.588 --> 04:20:50.999
LIAM: I've always been fascinated with the mind flayers.

04:20:50.999 --> 04:20:54.832
You're fucking throwing
an army of them at us.

04:20:56.669 --> 04:20:57.762
'Cause they're dangerous.

04:20:57.762 --> 04:20:59.155
MATT: Yeah, they're terrible.

04:20:59.155 --> 04:21:01.803
LIAM: And they're so outside of the norm.

04:21:01.803 --> 04:21:03.788
MATT: And hey you stealthed up,

04:21:03.788 --> 04:21:05.722
and pretty much killed
one in one round today.

04:21:05.722 --> 04:21:06.974
ORION: That was insane.

04:21:06.974 --> 04:21:09.579
When the mud on the face,

04:21:09.579 --> 04:21:11.512
and the stab in the
fucking back of the head.

04:21:11.512 --> 04:21:15.095
MATT: You guys black ops'ed that entire barracks.

04:21:16.533 --> 04:21:18.679
LIAM: I'm proud of the knife.

04:21:18.679 --> 04:21:21.567
TALIESIN: I know what you're talking about.

04:21:21.567 --> 04:21:23.433
TRAVIS: Grog and Scanlan have no bastard children,

04:21:23.433 --> 04:21:24.893
that we know of.

04:21:27.019 --> 04:21:28.787
Or that you can prove.

04:21:28.787 --> 04:21:30.124
LIAM: Other streamed D&amp;amp;D games,

04:21:30.124 --> 04:21:33.551
like Rollplay hosted by itmejp?

04:21:33.551 --> 04:21:34.384
TRAVIS: No.

04:21:34.384 --> 04:21:35.399
LIAM: No.

04:21:35.399 --> 04:21:36.564
Maybe we will, though.

04:21:36.564 --> 04:21:37.397
ORION: I won't.

04:21:37.397 --> 04:21:40.300
LIAM: Everyone play Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons.

04:21:40.300 --> 04:21:43.050
ASHLEY: My favorite NPC character is

04:21:46.174 --> 04:21:47.994
a little butler who I think became--

04:21:48.963 --> 04:21:50.125
TRAVIS: Yes!

04:21:50.125 --> 04:21:52.778
ASHLEY: He's the cutest little
thing you will ever see,

04:21:52.778 --> 04:21:55.385
and I think now he works at--

04:21:55.385 --> 04:21:56.360
TALIESIN: He works for us now.

04:21:56.360 --> 04:21:57.344
MATT: Yep, you guys hired him,

04:21:57.344 --> 04:21:59.974
and he's currently helping
keep your Keep in good shape.

04:21:59.974 --> 04:22:00.898
ASHLEY: What's his name?

04:22:00.898 --> 04:22:01.731
ORION: The old fellow, right?

04:22:01.731 --> 04:22:04.611
MATT: I'm trying to remember, I'll have to
go look at the list again.

04:22:04.611 --> 04:22:05.729
I have so many NPCs, I have a hard time.

04:22:05.729 --> 04:22:06.819
ASHLEY: He's just the sweetest little thing

04:22:06.819 --> 04:22:08.236
you ever did see.

04:22:11.030 --> 04:22:12.375
MATT: Grog's flatlined intelligence,

04:22:12.375 --> 04:22:13.817
anything like that happen before?

04:22:13.817 --> 04:22:16.744
That was the first of
that type of situation.

04:22:16.744 --> 04:22:18.611
TRAVIS: I went unconscious once 'cause I fell,

04:22:18.611 --> 04:22:19.506
how far did I fall?

04:22:19.506 --> 04:22:20.419
TALIESIN: Wow, you fell.

04:22:20.419 --> 04:22:21.436
ORION: Oh, that was a crazy one too.

04:22:21.436 --> 04:22:23.373
MATT: They were there fighting
in an underground cavern,

04:22:23.373 --> 04:22:25.223
and at the very, very top of this giant,

04:22:25.223 --> 04:22:27.467
like 170-foot ceiling,

04:22:27.467 --> 04:22:29.463
which they had all kinda floated up to,

04:22:29.463 --> 04:22:31.789
and put a rope, anchor in.

04:22:31.789 --> 04:22:33.183
TRAVIS: I was ready to Toro the bull.

04:22:33.183 --> 04:22:35.346
MATT: The first umber hulk you guys ever encountered,

04:22:35.346 --> 04:22:37.252
ended up pushing Grog out of the hole,

04:22:37.252 --> 04:22:38.715
bullrushing him.

04:22:38.715 --> 04:22:40.642
Had the rope tied around his waist,

04:22:40.642 --> 04:22:42.359
but unfortunately Grog
weighs about 600 pounds,

04:22:42.359 --> 04:22:43.192
rope snapped,

04:22:43.192 --> 04:22:44.736
and he took enough damage
to go from full health

04:22:44.736 --> 04:22:47.573
to unconscious and
bleeding out in one round.

04:22:47.573 --> 04:22:49.517
MARISHA: 'Cause he confused you, right?

04:22:49.517 --> 04:22:51.768
And you just hari-karied off the hole?

04:22:51.768 --> 04:22:53.596
TRAVIS: I was gonna dodge and be all awesome,

04:22:53.596 --> 04:22:57.323
and say ole or some
shit, but I was just out.

04:22:57.323 --> 04:22:59.746
MARISHA: That was when I was a spider tiger.

04:22:59.746 --> 04:23:01.531
'Cause I cast Spider Climb on myself,

04:23:01.531 --> 04:23:02.546
and I was in tiger form,

04:23:02.546 --> 04:23:04.402
so I was spider climbing
all over the place.

04:23:04.402 --> 04:23:05.756
MATT: That's also one of my
favorite risky rolls,

04:23:05.756 --> 04:23:07.416
which was after that happened,

04:23:07.416 --> 04:23:10.251
Tiberius, you pushed the
umber hulk onto the ground,

04:23:10.251 --> 04:23:11.778
or through the hole, it fell.

04:23:11.778 --> 04:23:13.532
ORION: I had this amazing spell with Pathfinder

04:23:13.532 --> 04:23:17.163
called Aquasphere, orb, and you can like,

04:23:17.163 --> 04:23:19.355
capture large creatures.

04:23:19.355 --> 04:23:21.657
I literally can waterbend a sphere

04:23:21.657 --> 04:23:23.943
and carry this dude and drop them down,

04:23:23.943 --> 04:23:26.751
it was amazing, I miss it so much.

04:23:26.751 --> 04:23:28.334
Continue the story.

04:23:29.709 --> 04:23:32.021
MATT: So essentially Tiberius decided,

04:23:32.021 --> 04:23:33.206
'cause Grog was unconscious,

04:23:33.206 --> 04:23:34.507
and the creature was down there.

04:23:34.507 --> 04:23:35.970
All of them were stuck 170 feet up,

04:23:35.970 --> 04:23:38.632
in this little hive essentially.

04:23:38.632 --> 04:23:40.765
Tiberius said fuck it, he
jumped out of the hole,

04:23:40.765 --> 04:23:44.339
swan dove down, and cast
Featherfall on himself

04:23:44.339 --> 04:23:45.172
at the last minute,

04:23:45.172 --> 04:23:46.240
had to make a concentration check

04:23:46.240 --> 04:23:47.455
because of the wind rushing past,

04:23:47.455 --> 04:23:48.549
and having to cast a spell while falling.

04:23:48.549 --> 04:23:50.037
It's a very difficult thing.

04:23:50.037 --> 04:23:53.903
He had about a 40% chance of success,

04:23:53.903 --> 04:23:56.223
60% chance of instant
death, and he made the roll.

04:23:56.223 --> 04:24:00.396
I love risky moments like
that so much, I love 'em.

04:24:00.396 --> 04:24:02.740
TRAVIS: It was pretty legit.

04:24:02.740 --> 04:24:05.717
ORION: I did it again and held
that fucker, it was intense.

04:24:05.717 --> 04:24:07.953
MARISHA: I'm wondering when we're
gonna face a beholder.

04:24:07.953 --> 04:24:09.093
MATT: That'll be nasty.

04:24:09.093 --> 04:24:11.737
MARISHA: That's my favorite D&amp;amp;D monster.

04:24:11.737 --> 04:24:13.312
ORION: With all the eyes?

04:24:13.312 --> 04:24:16.514
MARISHA: They're like a big floating head

04:24:16.514 --> 04:24:19.235
with a giant eye, and
they've got tentacles,

04:24:19.235 --> 04:24:20.856
with eyes on the end of 'em,

04:24:20.856 --> 04:24:25.194
and each eyeball does a
different ray of effect.

04:24:25.194 --> 04:24:26.433
TRAVIS: A beholder?

04:24:26.433 --> 04:24:27.975
MATT: Nasty.

04:24:27.975 --> 04:24:29.454
TRAVIS: You know what that is too?

04:24:29.454 --> 04:24:30.628
LIAM: Yeah.
MARISHA: They're nasty.

04:24:30.628 --> 04:24:31.461
ASHLEY: Bad news bears.

04:24:31.461 --> 04:24:32.406
MARISHA: They're super awesome.

04:24:32.406 --> 04:24:33.983
One of these days we're gonna fight one.

04:24:33.983 --> 04:24:35.221
MATT: One of these days.

04:24:35.221 --> 04:24:38.511
LIAM: They're a signature character
of Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons.

04:24:38.511 --> 04:24:39.870
They represent D&amp;amp;D.

04:24:39.870 --> 04:24:42.639
TRAVIS: What made the dwarves get
bigger today in the battle?

04:24:42.639 --> 04:24:44.818
MATT: That's actually an ability of the duergar.

04:24:44.818 --> 04:24:45.651
LIAM: Viagra.

04:24:45.651 --> 04:24:46.783
MATT: Yeah.

04:24:46.783 --> 04:24:50.206
They can summon through
sheer force of will,

04:24:50.206 --> 04:24:52.027
and just the way they've
been bred over time,

04:24:52.027 --> 04:24:54.222
they can increase their
form for a short time

04:24:54.222 --> 04:24:55.935
to increase their damage,

04:24:55.935 --> 04:24:58.495
and be just a general asshole, so.

04:24:58.495 --> 04:25:00.065
It's an ability the duergar have.

04:25:00.065 --> 04:25:01.243
TRAVIS: Long lost son.

04:25:01.243 --> 04:25:04.038
LIAM: I'm gonna guess that none
of us have been to Sweden?

04:25:04.038 --> 04:25:04.871
MATT: I have.

04:25:04.871 --> 04:25:06.515
ASHLEY: My dad was from Sweden.

04:25:06.515 --> 04:25:08.419
MATT: That's awesome. I've been to Gothenberg.

04:25:08.419 --> 04:25:09.275
TALIESIN: That's not surprising.

04:25:09.275 --> 04:25:10.806
ORION: I have not, but I would like to go.

04:25:10.806 --> 04:25:12.692
MARISHA: Yeah, who wouldn't
want to go to Sweden?

04:25:12.692 --> 04:25:14.188
LIAM: Makes sense.

04:25:14.188 --> 04:25:15.481
Pale and blonde.

04:25:15.481 --> 04:25:16.864
MATT: Have you been?

04:25:16.864 --> 04:25:17.697
ASHLEY: Never been.

04:25:17.697 --> 04:25:20.507
MATT: It's beautiful, I spent two
weeks in Gothenberg, Sweden,

04:25:20.507 --> 04:25:21.999
on business years ago.

04:25:21.999 --> 04:25:23.543
It was gorgeous.

04:25:23.543 --> 04:25:24.633
Food was amazing.

04:25:24.633 --> 04:25:25.512
Nothing like walking down the street

04:25:25.512 --> 04:25:27.867
and seeing a giant gothic stone structure

04:25:27.867 --> 04:25:29.683
with an archway and a gargoyle perched,

04:25:29.683 --> 04:25:32.367
and you walk in and it's a 7-Eleven.

04:25:32.367 --> 04:25:33.512
It's pretty hilarious.

04:25:33.512 --> 04:25:34.652
All the architecture there is old,

04:25:34.652 --> 04:25:36.897
but it's been repurposed, it's great.

04:25:36.897 --> 04:25:38.722
LIAM: If you had to choose

04:25:38.722 --> 04:25:40.302
would you pick to receive an extra level,

04:25:40.302 --> 04:25:41.495
or Matt's hair?

04:25:41.495 --> 04:25:43.022
MATT: God damn it.
LIAM: Matt's hair.

04:25:43.022 --> 04:25:44.151
(all laugh)

04:25:44.151 --> 04:25:46.037
ASHLEY: Hair, obviously.

04:25:46.037 --> 04:25:47.421
MARISHA: Receive an extra level or Matt's hair.

04:25:47.421 --> 04:25:51.245
TRAVIS: You can't get hair like
this without unicorn blood.

04:25:51.245 --> 04:25:52.810
My God.

04:25:52.810 --> 04:25:53.743
MATT: I'm gonna shave my head one of these days.

04:25:53.743 --> 04:25:56.937
LIAM: Shave his head, he can't DM anymore.

04:25:56.937 --> 04:25:58.123
MATT: I'd wither.

04:25:58.123 --> 04:25:58.956
It's like Sampson.

04:25:58.956 --> 04:26:00.717
I would just like become
this little raisin,

04:26:00.717 --> 04:26:01.792
I'd be David Tennant.

04:26:01.792 --> 04:26:05.793
LIAM: The beholder strikes for the-- mawp. Mawp.

04:26:09.837 --> 04:26:11.233
MATT: Let's see.

04:26:11.233 --> 04:26:12.954
What are the questions we got up there?

04:26:12.954 --> 04:26:14.608
MARISHA: It is 11:38, by the way.

04:26:14.608 --> 04:26:17.217
LIAM: What is the most outrageous
and unexpected thing

04:26:17.217 --> 04:26:19.266
to come from a natural 20?

04:26:19.266 --> 04:26:20.914
That was Scanlan.

04:26:20.914 --> 04:26:22.258
ASHLEY: Probably the--

04:26:22.258 --> 04:26:24.367
LIAM: Scanlan as Burt Reynolds.

04:26:24.367 --> 04:26:25.378
MARISHA: Oh right.

04:26:25.378 --> 04:26:29.545
MATT: We'll take about five
more minutes of questions.

04:26:30.580 --> 04:26:31.538
Five or ten more minutes of questions,

04:26:31.538 --> 04:26:32.371
then we gotta take off.

04:26:32.371 --> 04:26:33.625
LIAM: How long will you be doing this show?

04:26:33.625 --> 04:26:34.458
30 years.

04:26:35.971 --> 04:26:38.675
MATT: Considering we've been playing
for two and a half years,

04:26:38.675 --> 04:26:40.284
and everyone's level nine,

04:26:40.284 --> 04:26:44.250
we can keep going for quite some time.

04:26:44.250 --> 04:26:46.273
Whether or not we continue past that,

04:26:46.273 --> 04:26:48.165
means either we do a new campaign,

04:26:48.165 --> 04:26:51.968
or we go into epic or mythic levels?

04:26:51.968 --> 04:26:54.916
We'll cross that bridge when we get to it.

04:26:54.916 --> 04:26:55.763
I mean, I'd love to keep playing

04:26:55.763 --> 04:26:56.746
for as long as people wanna play,

04:26:56.746 --> 04:26:58.265
but also people get busy, life changes,

04:26:58.265 --> 04:26:59.611
we'll see how it goes.

04:26:59.611 --> 04:27:02.414
I'm in for the long haul as
much as everyone else is.

04:27:02.414 --> 04:27:04.717
LIAM: Matt, multiple people are
asking what the music is

04:27:04.717 --> 04:27:06.615
that we're hearing on the show.

04:27:06.615 --> 04:27:08.909
MATT: What you hear in the
show is a combination of

04:27:08.909 --> 04:27:10.386
a gentlemen named Kevin Macleod,

04:27:10.386 --> 04:27:13.423
who has a website called Incompetech,

04:27:13.423 --> 04:27:15.837
which he produces really amazing,

04:27:15.837 --> 04:27:17.561
royalty-free musical tracks.

04:27:17.561 --> 04:27:20.134
I've used them for many
web series for many years.

04:27:20.134 --> 04:27:21.283
He's very talented, and I contacted him,

04:27:21.283 --> 04:27:22.597
and asked him permission
to use on the stream.

04:27:22.597 --> 04:27:24.935
He's like, "yeah, anything
on Twitch, go for it."

04:27:24.935 --> 04:27:28.410
And the other half are a
lot of soundscapes I use

04:27:28.410 --> 04:27:30.007
from a company called Platemail Games,

04:27:30.007 --> 04:27:33.186
which make great custom RPG soundscapes,

04:27:33.186 --> 04:27:36.034
and some tracks that are just creepy,

04:27:36.034 --> 04:27:39.636
and dwarf cityscapes,
and dark forest night.

04:27:39.636 --> 04:27:41.922
It's a great, great resource.

04:27:41.922 --> 04:27:45.728
Those are my two big ones
for this Twitch stream.

04:27:45.728 --> 04:27:47.858
ORION: And yes, we did roll
for our starting stats.

04:27:47.858 --> 04:27:51.432
MATT: Yeah it was 4d6, drop the lowest,

04:27:51.432 --> 04:27:52.314
arrange as desired.

04:27:52.314 --> 04:27:55.452
So it was a powerful campaign.

04:27:55.452 --> 04:27:57.316
LIAM: What was the most nail-biting moment

04:27:57.316 --> 04:27:58.286
the group has seen?

04:27:58.286 --> 04:27:59.119
It was Pike's death.

04:27:59.119 --> 04:27:59.952
MARISHA: Pike dying.

04:27:59.952 --> 04:28:01.035
MATT: Definitely.

04:28:04.685 --> 04:28:05.752
Do you prefer being the DM,

04:28:05.752 --> 04:28:07.062
or do you like mixing it
up and being characters?

04:28:07.062 --> 04:28:09.084
I never get a chance to play games really.

04:28:09.084 --> 04:28:10.451
It's kind of one of those, always a DM,

04:28:10.451 --> 04:28:12.698
never a bride circumstance.

04:28:12.698 --> 04:28:13.550
LIAM: You wanna play with my kid?

04:28:13.550 --> 04:28:14.776
MATT: Yeah.

04:28:14.776 --> 04:28:16.261
I'll be an evil character
and murder them all,

04:28:16.261 --> 04:28:17.670
you're going to regret it immediately,

04:28:17.670 --> 04:28:18.560
make 'em just cry.

04:28:18.560 --> 04:28:20.354
LIAM: "Listen, that's the game, suck it up!"

04:28:20.354 --> 04:28:22.267
MATT: Yeah, turn it into Mazes and Monsters.

04:28:22.267 --> 04:28:23.640
TALIESIN: Is that why you play so much War Machine,

04:28:23.640 --> 04:28:26.267
is because for once you
don't have to be responsible?

04:28:26.267 --> 04:28:27.184
MATT: Probably.

04:28:28.091 --> 04:28:29.160
I occasionally,

04:28:29.160 --> 04:28:30.812
I got to play a game of
Diaspora for a while,

04:28:30.812 --> 04:28:33.156
with Philip Eisner, the guy
who wrote Event Horizon.

04:28:33.156 --> 04:28:37.239
So playing a sci-fi kind
of horror-based universe

04:28:38.763 --> 04:28:39.982
with him running, that was great.

04:28:39.982 --> 04:28:40.854
That was very brief.

04:28:40.854 --> 04:28:43.976
LIAM: Matt, can you give us any
teasers of things to come?

04:28:43.976 --> 04:28:44.830
MATT: No.

04:28:46.681 --> 04:28:47.762
See as they happen, man,

04:28:47.762 --> 04:28:49.537
that's part of the fun,
the mystery of it all.

04:28:49.537 --> 04:28:50.775
I know what's coming.

04:28:50.775 --> 04:28:52.658
I got stuff planned for years.

04:28:52.658 --> 04:28:53.491
It's gonna be fun.

04:28:53.491 --> 04:28:56.476
LIAM: Do you have any advice
to get into voice acting?

04:28:56.476 --> 04:28:59.068
Learn to act, study acting,
go to where the work is,

04:28:59.068 --> 04:29:02.967
keep acting, in anything,
in fucking anything.

04:29:02.967 --> 04:29:04.477
Go to where the work is.

04:29:06.622 --> 04:29:07.455
Act.

04:29:09.703 --> 04:29:10.836
MATT: What age did you play your first

04:29:10.836 --> 04:29:12.327
tabletop RPG game?

04:29:12.327 --> 04:29:14.536
For me it was Second
Edition Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons,

04:29:14.536 --> 04:29:16.542
and it was freshman year of high school.

04:29:16.542 --> 04:29:18.010
TALIESIN: GURPS, 13.

04:29:18.010 --> 04:29:21.406
I was, yeah, 13 years old, GURPS.

04:29:21.406 --> 04:29:23.562
ASHLEY: Favorite tabletop games, not D&amp;amp;D?

04:29:23.562 --> 04:29:24.974
LIAM: Get Hulk Hogan to play.

04:29:24.974 --> 04:29:25.807
ORION: That's not D&amp;amp;D?

04:29:25.807 --> 04:29:27.649
TALIESIN: Mansions of Madness.

04:29:27.649 --> 04:29:29.556
MARISHA: Mansions of Madness is great.

04:29:29.556 --> 04:29:32.383
ORION: Is MTG, Magic the Gathering a tabletop?

04:29:32.383 --> 04:29:33.289
Is that considered tabletop?

04:29:33.289 --> 04:29:35.622
MARISHA: It's a card building game.

04:29:36.538 --> 04:29:37.371
ORION: Magic.

04:29:38.389 --> 04:29:39.652
MARISHA: War Machine.

04:29:39.652 --> 04:29:41.278
MATT: War Machine is really fun.

04:29:41.278 --> 04:29:43.171
MARISHA: I'm a Cryx player.

04:29:43.171 --> 04:29:44.246
MATT: It's awesome.

04:29:44.246 --> 04:29:45.977
ASHLEY: I'm just starting.

04:29:45.977 --> 04:29:46.967
MATT: You're the awesome Retribution.

04:29:46.967 --> 04:29:49.428
ORION: I'm Circle of Orboros.

04:29:55.277 --> 04:29:57.750
TALIESIN: We played with Scanlan, of course we do.

04:29:57.750 --> 04:29:59.226
TRAVIS: It said do you ever think about sexuality

04:29:59.226 --> 04:30:01.653
while playing, besides Grog, of course.

04:30:01.653 --> 04:30:04.462
Scanlan does, I'm sure other people have.

04:30:04.462 --> 04:30:06.050
TALIESIN: It's hard not to think about it with Sam.

04:30:06.050 --> 04:30:08.278
TRAVIS: We just pay for it.

04:30:08.278 --> 04:30:10.374
LIAM: Are we gonna release more
background information

04:30:10.374 --> 04:30:11.688
of your campaign?

04:30:11.688 --> 04:30:12.666
MATT: Yes, actually.

04:30:12.666 --> 04:30:13.499
LIAM: We are?

04:30:14.591 --> 04:30:18.584
MATT: Time has been hard, but
I'm trudging through.

04:30:18.584 --> 04:30:20.731
What I'm gonna make
essentially is a video recap

04:30:20.731 --> 04:30:23.439
of the previous two and a
half years of the campaign.

04:30:23.439 --> 04:30:25.640
I'm gonna narrate it,
it's gonna be very simple.

04:30:25.640 --> 04:30:26.542
It's gonna be just information,

04:30:26.542 --> 04:30:29.067
with the occasional slides
of stuff in the background.

04:30:29.067 --> 04:30:30.436
But I'm working on a video,

04:30:30.436 --> 04:30:31.726
kind of like your guys' intros,

04:30:31.726 --> 04:30:34.914
that'll be a synopsis of the story

04:30:34.914 --> 04:30:36.716
up until this stream stared.

04:30:36.716 --> 04:30:37.983
TRAVIS: Claymation, that's awesome, man.

04:30:37.983 --> 04:30:41.148
MATT: I will destroy you, I
will fucking stab you.

04:30:41.148 --> 04:30:43.565
LIAM: If you want, it's not much,

04:30:44.635 --> 04:30:47.946
but I have a Vine account
that's under the name

04:30:47.946 --> 04:30:51.779
VoiceofOBrien, and I
took a lot of Vine videos

04:30:53.050 --> 04:30:54.064
from our private game.

04:30:54.064 --> 04:30:55.243
So it's not a ton,

04:30:55.243 --> 04:30:57.334
but you'll see us acting like shitheads.

04:30:57.334 --> 04:30:58.827
TRAVIS: That's seven seconds at a time.

04:30:58.827 --> 04:31:00.572
MARISHA: Seven seconds at a time, yeah.

04:31:00.572 --> 04:31:01.541
I think I still have the video

04:31:01.541 --> 04:31:04.265
of you trying to woo the nymph lady.

04:31:04.265 --> 04:31:06.848
TRAVIS: Try?
TALIESIN: That was a good video.

04:31:08.160 --> 04:31:10.175
MARISHA: It's basically just you
flirting with my boyfriend.

04:31:10.175 --> 04:31:11.996
TALIESIN: I have some videos of the tarot game,

04:31:11.996 --> 04:31:14.098
and a couple of us

04:31:14.098 --> 04:31:15.990
TRAVIS: Matt is now a nymph.

04:31:15.990 --> 04:31:17.573
MATT: Yeah, we sat there, and, hey man,

04:31:17.573 --> 04:31:19.536
I've had to flirt with
quite a few of these people

04:31:19.536 --> 04:31:21.904
as characters, it's interesting.

04:31:21.904 --> 04:31:25.753
LIAM: Who's your favorite NPC that
you brought to life for us?

04:31:25.753 --> 04:31:27.831
MATT: Oh, that's a tough one.

04:31:27.831 --> 04:31:28.743
There's been a lot of good ones.

04:31:28.743 --> 04:31:31.876
I really enjoyed Grimthorn,
the dwarf that was--

04:31:31.876 --> 04:31:32.826
LIAM: Clarota is pretty good.

04:31:32.826 --> 04:31:34.251
MATT: Yeah, Clarota is great.

04:31:34.251 --> 04:31:36.948
He was the one eyed dwarf with the shave,

04:31:36.948 --> 04:31:38.500
that was taking you guys
to the fighting ring.

04:31:38.500 --> 04:31:39.333
He was fun.

04:31:39.333 --> 04:31:42.150
I'm enjoying Balgus as
well, he's a good one.

04:31:42.150 --> 04:31:42.983
MARISHA: Ballsack.

04:31:42.983 --> 04:31:43.900
LIAM: Ballsack.

04:31:46.177 --> 04:31:48.847
MARISHA: Do we have nicknames for all of our NPCs?

04:31:48.847 --> 04:31:52.637
MATT: You know, I really enjoy
Arcanist Allura Visoren.

04:31:52.637 --> 04:31:53.470
ORION: So do I!

04:31:53.470 --> 04:31:57.637
MATT: She's an awesome, powerful,
headstrong elven sorceress,

04:31:58.969 --> 04:32:02.045
who is part of a, not a secret,

04:32:02.045 --> 04:32:05.992
but a very powerful circle
of magic practitioners

04:32:05.992 --> 04:32:06.825
around the world,

04:32:06.825 --> 04:32:08.520
and also a member of
the council of Tal'Dorei.

04:32:08.520 --> 04:32:10.479
She's one of the largest
allies that this group

04:32:10.479 --> 04:32:12.551
has had through a lot
of the adventure arcs,

04:32:12.551 --> 04:32:14.861
and I love playing her, she's great.

04:32:14.861 --> 04:32:17.624
LIAM: Grog, have you even thrown
a gnome as an attack.

04:32:17.624 --> 04:32:19.062
TRAVIS: The very first time we played,

04:32:19.062 --> 04:32:21.609
I picked up Sam and
chucked him across a room.

04:32:21.609 --> 04:32:23.010
That was full of a trap.

04:32:23.010 --> 04:32:24.093
MARISHA: Fastball special.

04:32:25.017 --> 04:32:26.851
TRAVIS: And it worked.

04:32:26.851 --> 04:32:28.024
It was awesome.

04:32:28.024 --> 04:32:28.872
MATT: What character type would I play

04:32:28.872 --> 04:32:29.908
if I ever got a chance to play?

04:32:29.908 --> 04:32:32.641
I would probably be a bard.

04:32:32.641 --> 04:32:36.528
I wanna make a bard that
actually conducts the battle.

04:32:36.528 --> 04:32:38.873
Meaning, sits there and watches the fight,

04:32:38.873 --> 04:32:40.159
and he's conducting,

04:32:40.159 --> 04:32:41.784
like music happens when
other people attack.

04:32:41.784 --> 04:32:44.029
Cymbals go off, and drum beats,

04:32:44.029 --> 04:32:46.235
and all of his abilities are tied to music,

04:32:46.235 --> 04:32:48.602
so he's actually conducting
the battle like a symphony.

04:32:48.602 --> 04:32:49.527
That's what I wanna make.

04:32:49.527 --> 04:32:50.360
MARISHA: That's cool.

04:32:50.360 --> 04:32:52.099
ASHLEY: That's badass.

04:32:52.099 --> 04:32:53.723
MATT: One day.

04:32:53.723 --> 04:32:55.775
LIAM: Would you ever play an evil character?

04:32:55.775 --> 04:32:58.527
My contingency plan, if I get killed,

04:32:58.527 --> 04:32:59.490
I don't know about evil,

04:32:59.490 --> 04:33:02.704
but he won't be as nice as Vax.

04:33:02.704 --> 04:33:04.508
MATT: Evil characters have to
be discussed with the DM.

04:33:04.508 --> 04:33:06.376
I'm iffy on the evil character,

04:33:06.376 --> 04:33:07.582
unless they have a good reason,

04:33:07.582 --> 04:33:09.451
and a personality that isn't going to

04:33:09.451 --> 04:33:11.136
completely derail the campaign.

04:33:11.136 --> 04:33:12.734
Doing an evil campaign, that's fine.

04:33:12.734 --> 04:33:14.573
But if you're building a character

04:33:14.573 --> 04:33:16.044
that is going to inherently be a troll,

04:33:16.044 --> 04:33:17.374
and basically diminish everybody else's

04:33:17.374 --> 04:33:20.505
good time in the story,
it becomes a problem.

04:33:20.505 --> 04:33:21.685
ZAC: It's the internet though, man.

04:33:21.685 --> 04:33:22.540
MATT: I know.

04:33:22.540 --> 04:33:24.903
If you make a cool,
interesting evil character,

04:33:24.903 --> 04:33:26.505
that can be evil but still like,

04:33:26.505 --> 04:33:28.990
like a good example would
be in Baldur's Gate, Edwin.

04:33:28.990 --> 04:33:30.679
ZAC: What if one of your guests,

04:33:30.679 --> 04:33:33.777
that came on for one night,
would they be allowed to be?

04:33:33.777 --> 04:33:34.882
MATT: Yeah, they'd be allowed to.

04:33:34.882 --> 04:33:37.228
They may not survive.

04:33:37.228 --> 04:33:39.187
ORION: Tiberius might not--

04:33:39.187 --> 04:33:40.144
MARISHA: Or kill them.

04:33:40.144 --> 04:33:42.708
LIAM: I don't know about evil,
but if I have to come back,

04:33:42.708 --> 04:33:44.968
I might be a lot more selfish.

04:33:44.968 --> 04:33:46.583
MATT: In it cool news, tabletop columnist,

04:33:46.583 --> 04:33:48.838
offering to DM a game for me.

04:33:48.838 --> 04:33:50.761
I may have to hit you
up on that some time.

04:33:50.761 --> 04:33:52.339
'Cause that'd be awesome.

04:33:52.339 --> 04:33:54.171
TALIESIN: He deserves a break.

04:33:55.170 --> 04:33:56.564
ZAC: How do you remember all the voices

04:33:56.564 --> 04:33:57.930
that you've done of the
NPC's over the years?

04:33:57.930 --> 04:34:00.509
MATT: I make notes and audio files.

04:34:00.509 --> 04:34:01.343
TRAVIS: You do?

04:34:01.343 --> 04:34:02.176
MATT: I do.

04:34:02.176 --> 04:34:03.087
As a reminder in case I forget.

04:34:03.087 --> 04:34:04.039
TRAVIS: Jarvis.

04:34:04.039 --> 04:34:05.633
(all laugh)

04:34:05.633 --> 04:34:07.280
MATT: I have notes written next to every NPC,

04:34:07.280 --> 04:34:09.420
like an accent or dialect
that I chose for them,

04:34:09.420 --> 04:34:10.785
a general texture.

04:34:10.785 --> 04:34:12.117
Kind of like what you'd see for breakdowns

04:34:12.117 --> 04:34:13.639
for a character you're auditioning for.

04:34:13.639 --> 04:34:14.808
I basically make that for each NPC

04:34:14.808 --> 04:34:16.165
to remind me of what I've done.

04:34:16.165 --> 04:34:17.634
And if it's a particularly weird voice

04:34:17.634 --> 04:34:19.736
that I don't know if I could
replicate in the future,

04:34:19.736 --> 04:34:21.502
after the session I'll go
and do a little audio file

04:34:21.502 --> 04:34:23.429
of me doing the voice so
I can go back to it later.

04:34:23.429 --> 04:34:24.848
TRAVIS: You're a freak of nature, man.

04:34:24.848 --> 04:34:25.848
TALIESIN: Seriously.

04:34:27.826 --> 04:34:28.659
MATT: Good question.

04:34:28.659 --> 04:34:29.491
MARISHA: There's a lot that goes into it.

04:34:29.491 --> 04:34:31.800
I think Matt, just to
put it into perspective,

04:34:31.800 --> 04:34:32.862
for everyone in the chat room,

04:34:32.862 --> 04:34:36.098
I think Matt probably
spends close to eight hours,

04:34:36.098 --> 04:34:39.840
at least, on each time before we play.

04:34:39.840 --> 04:34:41.831
Or I guess at least we used to.

04:34:41.831 --> 04:34:42.665
MATT: For our big session,

04:34:42.665 --> 04:34:44.476
I'd spend as much time
preparing as we did playing.

04:34:44.476 --> 04:34:45.310
I'll put it that way,

04:34:45.310 --> 04:34:46.304
I spend as much time preparing as we play.

04:34:46.304 --> 04:34:47.205
So for these sessions,

04:34:47.205 --> 04:34:48.653
I'm spending about three hours a week,

04:34:48.653 --> 04:34:50.585
preparing, what, three to four hours a week?

04:34:50.585 --> 04:34:52.088
For old sessions that was bigger.

04:34:52.088 --> 04:34:54.651
LIAM: Someone asked, what was the
reaction to discovering

04:34:54.651 --> 04:34:56.174
you had a magic flying carpet?

04:34:56.174 --> 04:34:59.094
Which you can see if you
go to Matt's YouTube channel.

04:34:59.094 --> 04:35:01.655
There's a video that
Ashley made of us playing,

04:35:01.655 --> 04:35:03.970
and you see our reactions to that.

04:35:03.970 --> 04:35:07.029
MARISHA: Who was it, was it you, or Vex?

04:35:07.029 --> 04:35:10.002
That tried to float down with the carpet,

04:35:10.002 --> 04:35:13.043
and then we realized it was magic?

04:35:13.043 --> 04:35:14.207
LIAM: Yeah, underneath.

04:35:14.207 --> 04:35:16.190
MARISHA: But we tried to just
use it like a parachute.

04:35:16.190 --> 04:35:18.232
MATT: It was a crumbling tower,
it was Allura's tower.

04:35:18.232 --> 04:35:19.874
You guys went into,
realized she was missing,

04:35:19.874 --> 04:35:21.901
because the tower had been attacked.

04:35:21.901 --> 04:35:23.754
You set off essentially a defense system

04:35:23.754 --> 04:35:25.770
of her arcane tower,

04:35:25.770 --> 04:35:28.325
which caused it to
crumble into a tiny pearl.

04:35:28.325 --> 04:35:29.743
ORION: Tiberius jumped out the window

04:35:29.743 --> 04:35:30.848
and just cast Featherfall.

04:35:30.848 --> 04:35:32.507
MATT: Yeah, and just kinda glided away.

04:35:32.507 --> 04:35:34.538
You turned into an eagle
and grabbed the gnomes.

04:35:34.538 --> 04:35:36.519
The rest of the party had to try

04:35:36.519 --> 04:35:38.810
to rapidly escape a crumbling tower

04:35:38.810 --> 04:35:40.481
that was compacting on to itself.

04:35:40.481 --> 04:35:43.493
MARISHA: I think it was mainly
the twins in the tower.

04:35:43.493 --> 04:35:45.493
LIAM: Hey, Grog almost died once.

04:35:47.045 --> 04:35:49.241
He fell from a great--

04:35:49.241 --> 04:35:50.784
MATT: You fall a lot, but when
you fall on to something,

04:35:50.784 --> 04:35:52.534
that thing is fucked.

04:35:54.643 --> 04:35:55.865
MATT: All right, we're winding down here,

04:35:55.865 --> 04:35:57.449
'cause we gotta leave here shortly guys.

04:35:57.449 --> 04:35:58.408
Two more questions.

04:35:58.408 --> 04:35:59.512
LIAM: Three more questions.

04:35:59.512 --> 04:36:00.930
ZAC: Closing messages
before you guys go, too.

04:36:00.930 --> 04:36:02.504
MATT: Oh yeah, all right, so we'll
do a couple more questions,

04:36:02.504 --> 04:36:04.252
then we'll go to closing messages.

04:36:04.252 --> 04:36:05.437
Who wants to pick?

04:36:05.437 --> 04:36:06.518
LIAM: Let's make it a magic three.

04:36:06.518 --> 04:36:07.534
MARISHA: Let's do a good one.

04:36:07.534 --> 04:36:11.502
MATT: Three, three questions, make 'em quick.

04:36:11.502 --> 04:36:12.502
Let's see.

04:36:16.979 --> 04:36:18.863
MARISHA: Waiting for a good one.

04:36:18.863 --> 04:36:20.080
MATT: How much does Grog weigh?

04:36:20.080 --> 04:36:22.598
Grog weighs approximately
600 pound we decided.

04:36:22.598 --> 04:36:24.442
TRAVIS: Just under 700.

04:36:24.442 --> 04:36:26.275
MATT: So he's kinda rough.

04:36:27.146 --> 04:36:28.569
TRAVIS: It's all muscle, bitch.

04:36:28.569 --> 04:36:30.035
MATT: Yeah it is.

04:36:30.035 --> 04:36:31.535
Muscle and brains.

04:36:32.845 --> 04:36:34.345
TRAVIS: Muscle and wang.

04:36:36.165 --> 04:36:37.529
500 pounds and a hundred-pound wang.

04:36:37.529 --> 04:36:38.797
MATT: Any of you consider running a game

04:36:38.797 --> 04:36:40.783
for fans of the stream?

04:36:40.783 --> 04:36:43.086
Actually, I've run a couple
games at conventions

04:36:43.086 --> 04:36:44.383
for some groups.

04:36:44.383 --> 04:36:46.990
I had a couple of sessions I ran,

04:36:46.990 --> 04:36:48.152
actually in conjunction with Wizards,

04:36:48.152 --> 04:36:49.579
they sent stuff out for us.

04:36:49.579 --> 04:36:50.492
TALIESIN: And for charity.

04:36:50.492 --> 04:36:54.947
MATT: Yeah, we've had some charity
D&amp;amp;D games out here in L.A.

04:36:54.947 --> 04:36:55.779
So we've done them before.

04:36:55.779 --> 04:36:57.719
I'd consider it if there
was time available,

04:36:57.719 --> 04:36:59.331
and a venue that allowed it.

04:36:59.331 --> 04:37:00.859
So if it does happen,

04:37:00.859 --> 04:37:03.692
we'll definitely announce it here.

04:37:05.017 --> 04:37:07.018
TRAVIS: Best item in your inventory?

04:37:07.018 --> 04:37:08.536
ORION: That's for a magic item?

04:37:08.536 --> 04:37:10.118
TRAVIS: Oh, did we already say that?

04:37:10.118 --> 04:37:10.952
I'm just blanking.

04:37:10.952 --> 04:37:11.785
ORION: No.

04:37:13.432 --> 04:37:15.432
TALIESIN: It's hard to read this quickly.

04:37:15.432 --> 04:37:16.648
MATT: You guys have some good questions.

04:37:16.648 --> 04:37:18.124
TRAVIS: My brain's turning into applesauce.

04:37:18.124 --> 04:37:19.541
ASHLEY: I know, me too.

04:37:22.732 --> 04:37:25.261
LIAM: Do you realize how lucky you all are

04:37:25.261 --> 04:37:27.451
to have such a nice group of friends?

04:37:27.451 --> 04:37:28.458
ALL: Yes.

04:37:28.458 --> 04:37:29.669
MATT: Very much so.

04:37:29.669 --> 04:37:31.849
TALIESIN: The world is cold and unfeeling.

04:37:31.849 --> 04:37:33.713
LIAM: Let's close it on that.

04:37:33.713 --> 04:37:35.237
I love these guys.

04:37:35.237 --> 04:37:38.011
MATT: And I like to think that this is,

04:37:38.011 --> 04:37:39.666
because there are so many good
people out there in the world,

04:37:39.666 --> 04:37:41.886
and we were lucky enough
to find each other

04:37:41.886 --> 04:37:42.936
through weird circumstances.

04:37:42.936 --> 04:37:44.832
And there are so many good
people in the world out there,

04:37:44.832 --> 04:37:45.978
don't close yourself off to it.

04:37:45.978 --> 04:37:48.169
You'd be surprised how many awesome--

04:37:48.169 --> 04:37:49.372
TRAVIS: How long does it usually take
the woman in the back

04:37:49.372 --> 04:37:51.215
to tie her boot?

04:37:51.215 --> 04:37:53.832
MARISHA: I'm multi-tasking.

04:37:53.832 --> 04:37:55.732
MATT: No, that's the question we end it on.

04:37:55.732 --> 04:37:57.797
That's the question.

04:37:57.797 --> 04:37:59.145
MARISHA: I've just been tightening my laces

04:37:59.145 --> 04:38:01.075
while I've been kicking it back here.

04:38:01.075 --> 04:38:02.935
ZAC: I'm gonna squeeze in here really quick.

04:38:08.277 --> 04:38:11.078
So I have some thank
you's I wanna call out

04:38:11.078 --> 04:38:12.618
while you guys are here.

04:38:12.618 --> 04:38:13.913
I figured they'd appreciate
me calling them out

04:38:13.913 --> 04:38:16.689
the most while you guys were on screen.

04:38:16.689 --> 04:38:18.848
'Cause they like you guys for some reason.

04:38:18.848 --> 04:38:19.681
ALL: Aw.

04:38:19.681 --> 04:38:22.106
ZAC: So these are all people
that have sent us stuff

04:38:22.106 --> 04:38:25.688
off Amazon, to help
make the studio better.

04:38:27.087 --> 04:38:28.587
So Danielle Denny.

04:38:30.101 --> 04:38:31.672
ASHLEY: Thanks Danielle!

04:38:31.672 --> 04:38:33.401
MATT: Danielle, thank you so much Danielle.

04:38:33.401 --> 04:38:34.901
ZAC: Bradley Dealman?

04:38:36.330 --> 04:38:37.163
MARISHA: Dalman.

04:38:37.163 --> 04:38:38.439
MATT: Bradley Dalman.

04:38:38.439 --> 04:38:39.430
LIAM: Do we know what they sent us?

04:38:39.430 --> 04:38:40.982
Can you tell us some of
the things they sent?

04:38:40.982 --> 04:38:42.556
ZAC: I have, I--

04:38:42.556 --> 04:38:45.256
Well I mean they're like--

04:38:45.256 --> 04:38:47.809
new microphones for
that station and lights.

04:38:47.809 --> 04:38:48.749
MARISHA: That's amazing.

04:38:48.749 --> 04:38:50.249
ZAC: Wii controllers.

04:38:51.113 --> 04:38:54.395
MATT: Brad, thank you, that's amazing.

04:38:54.395 --> 04:38:58.142
ZAC: And other stuff for tech we
needed that we didn't have.

04:38:58.142 --> 04:39:00.578
Shane and Russell said thanks
for all your hard work,

04:39:00.578 --> 04:39:01.938
and everything you are doing.

04:39:01.938 --> 04:39:03.047
MATT: Aw.

04:39:03.047 --> 04:39:03.881
Thank you Shane!

04:39:03.881 --> 04:39:05.437
ZAC: Ty Odlinger.

04:39:05.437 --> 04:39:06.871
ASHLEY: Ty!

04:39:06.871 --> 04:39:08.274
ZAC: Timothy B. Hudson.

04:39:08.274 --> 04:39:09.107
ASHLEY: Timothy!

04:39:09.107 --> 04:39:11.252
ZAC: Timothy B. Hudson, he went nuts.

04:39:11.252 --> 04:39:12.085
MATT: Timothy!

04:39:13.524 --> 04:39:14.577
TALIESIN: Triple threat.

04:39:14.577 --> 04:39:16.871
ZAC: Kathel T. Stockdale.

04:39:16.871 --> 04:39:18.532
ASHLEY: Cool name, Kathel.

04:39:18.532 --> 04:39:19.855
ZAC: Yeah, that's rad.

04:39:19.855 --> 04:39:21.355
Luis Archuletta.

04:39:22.537 --> 04:39:23.817
MATT: Luis Archeletta!

04:39:23.817 --> 04:39:25.343
ASHLEY: Luis!

04:39:25.343 --> 04:39:26.812
ZAC: Steve Chua.

04:39:26.812 --> 04:39:27.646
MATT: Steve!

04:39:27.646 --> 04:39:29.601
ZAC: Here's a little something
to help you guys out.

04:39:29.601 --> 04:39:31.214
Another one from Chua,

04:39:31.214 --> 04:39:32.373
here's a little something
to help you guys out.

04:39:32.373 --> 04:39:33.332
And I know there's more coming in,

04:39:33.332 --> 04:39:34.674
this is what we've got so far.

04:39:34.674 --> 04:39:35.625
Thanks everybody.

04:39:35.625 --> 04:39:37.108
MATT: That's so cool guys, thank you.

04:39:37.108 --> 04:39:40.957
ZAC: And they also have asked
that a couple of you guys

04:39:40.957 --> 04:39:42.916
come on Honesty Hour sometime.

04:39:42.916 --> 04:39:43.825
LIAM: What is that?

04:39:43.825 --> 04:39:46.825
ZAC: It's a show I do on Monday nights,

04:39:48.067 --> 04:39:51.574
where it's 100% no-holds-barred.

04:39:51.574 --> 04:39:54.237
I will answer any question that they ask.

04:39:54.237 --> 04:39:55.070
TRAVIS: What?

04:39:55.070 --> 04:39:56.270
ORION: I would love to do that.

04:39:56.270 --> 04:39:58.253
TRAVIS: Sounds like a horrifying idea.

04:39:58.253 --> 04:40:00.087
ZAC: Okay, they've asked
specifically for Ashley,

04:40:00.087 --> 04:40:01.419
they've asked for Matt, and as for,

04:40:01.419 --> 04:40:03.299
actually I think everyone has been asked

04:40:03.299 --> 04:40:04.759
at one point in time.

04:40:04.759 --> 04:40:07.047
So I'll say maybe I'll
have you guys once a month.

04:40:07.047 --> 04:40:08.629
ASHLEY: When is Honesty Hour?

04:40:08.629 --> 04:40:12.546
ZAC: It's usually Monday nights from nine to,

04:40:12.546 --> 04:40:13.700
whenever the fuck.

04:40:13.700 --> 04:40:16.044
Like it went to 1:30AM the other night.

04:40:16.044 --> 04:40:17.411
CREW: Isn't it really an Honesty Time?

04:40:17.411 --> 04:40:20.828
ZAC: Don't do it!

04:40:24.322 --> 04:40:25.756
It's only for subscribers.

04:40:25.756 --> 04:40:30.674
It's not that bad, because they
ask really great questions,

04:40:30.674 --> 04:40:31.881
a lot of them have been about

04:40:31.881 --> 04:40:34.404
how have you gotten through
certain aspects of depression,

04:40:34.404 --> 04:40:36.393
or what kind of thing--

04:40:36.393 --> 04:40:37.226
MARISHA: Oh that's good.

04:40:37.226 --> 04:40:38.952
ZAC: It's pretty inspirational.

04:40:38.952 --> 04:40:41.483
LIAM: How many times have you been
hit in the nuts in your life?

04:40:41.483 --> 04:40:42.692
ZAC: I can say twice.

04:40:42.692 --> 04:40:45.932
And would probably
explained how it happened,

04:40:45.932 --> 04:40:46.765
and what I did.

04:40:46.765 --> 04:40:48.478
It's just story time.

04:40:48.478 --> 04:40:51.873
Sometimes the questions
get a little inappropriate.

04:40:51.873 --> 04:40:53.039
MATT: That's okay.
ZAC: That's fine.

04:40:53.039 --> 04:40:53.872
MATT: But like for the most part,

04:40:53.872 --> 04:40:54.826
the audience here's been so awesome,

04:40:54.826 --> 04:40:56.968
they're all super intelligent
with great questions.

04:40:56.968 --> 04:40:58.382
I'd be down, I'd totally be down.

04:40:58.382 --> 04:40:59.972
ASHLEY: Wait, is this Noncompliant?

04:40:59.972 --> 04:41:00.835
ZAC: Yeah.

04:41:00.835 --> 04:41:01.773
MATT: Oh, that's awesome.

04:41:01.773 --> 04:41:04.479
Yeah, I got the Noncompliant
tattoo this week, actually.

04:41:04.479 --> 04:41:05.436
MARISHA: Oh yeah, I saw your picture.

04:41:05.436 --> 04:41:06.853
ASHLEY: That's amazing.

04:41:07.909 --> 04:41:09.381
ZAC: We have a comic book show on Tuesday.

04:41:09.381 --> 04:41:13.061
TRAVIS: (air-horn sound)

04:41:13.061 --> 04:41:13.907
ZAC: Real talk with Zac.

04:41:13.907 --> 04:41:16.046
But thank you guys so much for doing this.

04:41:16.046 --> 04:41:17.307
The subscribers really wanted to do it,

04:41:17.307 --> 04:41:19.980
so hopefully you guys enjoyed as well.

04:41:19.980 --> 04:41:21.147
And we will

04:41:22.743 --> 04:41:24.553
come back next week.

04:41:24.553 --> 04:41:25.386
TRAVIS: Yeah!

04:41:25.386 --> 04:41:26.219
ASHLEY: Yay!

04:41:27.899 --> 04:41:31.297
ZAC: Tomorrow, if you guys are at Wonder Con,

04:41:31.297 --> 04:41:33.085
are any of you guys
gonna be at Wonder Con?

04:41:33.085 --> 04:41:34.654
TALIESIN: Saturday.
MARISHA: I don't know, maybe.

04:41:34.654 --> 04:41:36.025
ORION: I'll be there Saturday.

04:41:36.025 --> 04:41:37.120
MATT: I'm sadly not gonna be there.

04:41:37.120 --> 04:41:40.870
ZAC: I will be there tomorrow
from 12:30 to one,

04:41:42.990 --> 04:41:44.494
for a meet and greet,

04:41:44.494 --> 04:41:47.191
which I'm going to pretend
is an autograph signing,

04:41:47.191 --> 04:41:48.646
and I'm going to bring my own pictures.

04:41:48.646 --> 04:41:50.675
MATT: Yeah!

04:41:50.675 --> 04:41:51.811
ZAC: We're gonna have fun with it.

04:41:51.811 --> 04:41:53.183
Going in costume.

04:41:53.183 --> 04:41:55.173
Becca and I are going in costume,

04:41:55.173 --> 04:41:57.774
and then Hector and Ify will be at four.

04:41:57.774 --> 04:42:01.816
And then Hector and Ify are doing a Q and A,

04:42:01.816 --> 04:42:05.886
or no, a trivia game
that night on the stage

04:42:05.886 --> 04:42:07.401
for Geek &amp;amp; Sundry and stuff like that.

04:42:07.401 --> 04:42:08.708
So Geek &amp;amp; Sundry will be there,

04:42:08.708 --> 04:42:10.295
you guys should stop by.

04:42:10.295 --> 04:42:13.659
LIAM: Thanks for all those
greater than three's, guys.

04:42:13.659 --> 04:42:15.047
MATT: Less than three's.

04:42:15.047 --> 04:42:17.348
TALIESIN: Greater than three, too.

04:42:17.348 --> 04:42:18.722
ZAC: The computer, the story behind that,

04:42:18.722 --> 04:42:20.457
is during the charity drive,

04:42:20.457 --> 04:42:23.713
we had a robot read off
all the donation messages.

04:42:23.713 --> 04:42:25.742
And the robot would say,
and when they made a heart,

04:42:25.742 --> 04:42:27.804
it would say, "we less than three."

04:42:27.804 --> 04:42:28.671
MATT: So beautiful.

04:42:28.671 --> 04:42:29.847
ZAC: So we turned that into a thing.

04:42:29.847 --> 04:42:31.663
LIAM: (robot voice) We less than three you.

04:42:32.913 --> 04:42:36.305
MATT: It fucks me up every time you do that.

04:42:36.305 --> 04:42:37.209
ZAC: Cool.

04:42:37.209 --> 04:42:38.180
Thanks guys!

04:42:38.180 --> 04:42:39.541
TALIESIN: Forgot you speak-and-spell.

04:42:39.541 --> 04:42:40.374
ZAC: Thank you so much.

04:42:40.374 --> 04:42:42.452
MARISHA: Bye.
