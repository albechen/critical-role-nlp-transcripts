00:00:00.297 --> 00:00:05.885
MATT: And welcome back to our second half of our
Shadow of War game, brought to you and sponsored

00:00:05.885 --> 00:00:13.316
by WB Games. Thank you so much for letting this
happen. All of us are all voice actors in the

00:00:13.316 --> 00:00:18.327
game, in case you didn't check out the intro to
the first half. We're excited to bring these

00:00:18.327 --> 00:00:22.653
orcish characters of this one-shot together. If
you haven't seen the first half, you should

00:00:22.653 --> 00:00:26.497
probably go back and watch that first. Otherwise,
you'll be really confused.

00:00:26.497 --> 00:00:28.398
LAURA: You should because it's really good.

00:00:28.398 --> 00:00:29.706
DARIN: Well, we could do it right now.

00:00:29.706 --> 00:00:30.902
LAURA: Yeah, do it all again?

00:00:30.902 --> 00:00:36.499
MATT: Yeah! Fine! But yeah, Shadow of War comes
out October 10th, looking forward to that. The

00:00:36.499 --> 00:00:45.187
Shadow of War iOS and Android game is out now, so
check it out. Anyway, bringing us back in. As the Forcs--

00:00:45.187 --> 00:00:47.616
TRAVIS and LAURA: The Forcs!

00:00:47.616 --> 00:00:52.321
MATT: As the Forcs have taken their break to rest
themselves for a moment, to assess what to do

00:00:52.321 --> 00:00:58.388
next, you are now standing on the opposite edge of
one of the Mithrim Spur Mountains, just past the

00:00:58.388 --> 00:01:04.261
crest. As you traveled down, you found hidden in
this alcove, six uruks, five of which are

00:01:04.261 --> 00:01:07.348
currently sleeping and bundled, and one who's
keeping watch with a burning torch.

00:01:07.348 --> 00:01:09.160
LAURA: Wait, did we actually take a short rest?

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:10.420
SAM: No.

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.053
TRAVIS: I got the numbers wrong.

00:01:12.053 --> 00:01:14.121
LAURA: I thought it was intentional.

00:01:14.121 --> 00:01:15.422
TRAVIS: Totally.

00:01:15.422 --> 00:01:18.714
LAURA: We took a moment, so I didn't actually get
my action surge back.

00:01:18.714 --> 00:01:19.781
MATT: Nope.

00:01:19.781 --> 00:01:21.609
SAM: Why are you Australian now?

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:22.918
LAURA: Am I?

00:01:22.918 --> 00:01:24.499
TRAVIS: It's super flexible.

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:26.797
LAURA: Don't you worry about it, Samuel.

00:01:26.797 --> 00:01:33.070
DARIN: If you've seen the first part, please send
us a clip of what we sounded like at that point.

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:42.500
So we can go back, "Oh, right!" Because apparently
(French accent) I am this orc. I enjoy a fork.

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:51.650
TRAVIS: Slavic. Listen, I have not bathed a short
sword in blood under the cover of dark in so long!

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:58.435
I want to sneak up, and I want to take their
bowels and pull them out while they sleep. But! We

00:01:58.435 --> 00:02:02.272
have to take care of that one that's watching
guard, first. Who's sneaky?

00:02:02.272 --> 00:02:04.038
LAURA: Should I run down there and kill him?

00:02:04.038 --> 00:02:05.419
TRAVIS: Naw, are you sneaky?

00:02:05.419 --> 00:02:06.664
LAURA: I don't know.

00:02:06.664 --> 00:02:08.466
TRAVIS: Can you look?

00:02:08.466 --> 00:02:11.278
SAM: Skak, don't you have some sort of a
crossbow?

00:02:11.278 --> 00:02:12.379
TRAVIS: I do!

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:14.249
SAM: Maybe you should be the one to take him
down.

00:02:14.249 --> 00:02:16.856
LAURA: Maybe we can lead him toward us and then--

00:02:16.856 --> 00:02:18.532
SAM: Oh, we could cause a diversion!

00:02:18.532 --> 00:02:21.683
LAURA: Yeah, and then you can take him out away
from the guards that're sleeping.

00:02:21.683 --> 00:02:22.941
TRAVIS: I like it!

00:02:22.941 --> 00:02:28.040
SAM: Wait. If we make a noise or something, won't
he wake up everybody else?

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.631
LAURA: What if we hit him with a rock and he comes
looking for it?

00:02:30.631 --> 00:02:32.908
TRAVIS: Yeah, or you crack a branch, right?
(cracking noise)

00:02:32.908 --> 00:02:37.499
LAURA: Oh, that's a good idea! And I take a really
big branch and I break it in half.

00:02:37.499 --> 00:02:42.189
SAM: Oh no. We're dumb.

00:02:42.189 --> 00:02:50.410
MATT: The minute you hear the (cracking) sound,
you hear this faint (grunt) sound over the cliff.

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:53.221
As you glance over, you see the one with the torch
is now like--

00:02:53.221 --> 00:02:55.266
SAM: How far away is he?

00:02:55.266 --> 00:02:58.219
MATT: About 25 feet from you, 30 feet, down
below.

00:02:58.219 --> 00:03:00.350
SAM: Crossbow him!

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:02.369
LAURA: (hooting)

00:03:02.369 --> 00:03:04.839
MATT: He's now walking toward one of them to
start--

00:03:04.839 --> 00:03:07.362
LAURA: I'm trying to sound like an owl in the
night. Hoo-hoo!

00:03:07.362 --> 00:03:10.261
MATT: Make a performance check.

00:03:10.261 --> 00:03:11.452
LAURA: Okay.

00:03:11.452 --> 00:03:14.939
TRAVIS: Can I aid her? Can I aid her with my Minor
Illusion?

00:03:14.939 --> 00:03:20.621
MATT: Sure. How-- what are you going to do?

00:03:20.621 --> 00:03:23.383
TRAVIS: Let's make it, like, a two-headed owl.

00:03:23.383 --> 00:03:26.922
LAURA: I like it. Do I roll at advantage, then?

00:03:26.922 --> 00:03:36.191
MATT: Because it's a two-headed owl? No. Sorry.
What'd you roll?

00:03:36.191 --> 00:03:39.092
LAURA: Oh, I rolled a three. Minus two.

00:03:39.092 --> 00:03:47.295
MATT: (laughing) So it's a (gurgling).

00:03:47.295 --> 00:03:51.503
LAURA and TRAVIS: (hooting and gurgling)

00:03:51.503 --> 00:03:52.677
TRAVIS: Wait, harmony.

00:03:52.677 --> 00:03:54.642
LAURA and TRAVIS: (harmonizing) Hoo!

00:03:54.642 --> 00:03:57.698
SAM: Little pitchy.

00:03:57.698 --> 00:04:02.473
MATT: The uruk keeping guard immediately goes,
"What the shrak?" Goes and starts shaking one of

00:04:02.473 --> 00:04:03.542
them awake.

00:04:03.542 --> 00:04:05.038
LAURA: Oh no! Hit him before he does that!

00:04:05.038 --> 00:04:08.069
TRAVIS: I take the crossbow and I try to put it
right in the back, where his head meets his neck.

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:11.607
MATT: Okay. He doesn't currently see you,
necessarily. Roll a stealth check.

00:04:11.607 --> 00:04:14.904
TRAVIS: 20.

00:04:14.904 --> 00:04:19.620
MATT: Does not seem to see you, so roll advantage
on the attack.

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:24.259
TRAVIS: Okay. Natural 20.

00:04:24.259 --> 00:04:28.976
MATT: So go ahead and roll the dice.

00:04:28.976 --> 00:04:33.802
TRAVIS: Okay. d8 plus four. Eight, (counting).

00:04:33.802 --> 00:04:36.909
MATT: Well, roll your sneak attack damage too,
because that all gets doubled as well.

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:42.829
TRAVIS: 16, 19, 22.

00:04:42.829 --> 00:04:44.480
LAURA: 22 times two.

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:49.460
MATT: Well, you don't add the modifier to it yet.
Double dice. So 22 times two? As he's shaking one

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:58.841
of the uruk, he's like, "Hey, get up! Oof!"
(gurgling) The one uruk's like, "What the shit?

00:04:58.841 --> 00:05:08.150
"I was sleeping!" The other one's like, (gurgling)
and falls onto his back, dead. He's like, "Huh?"

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:12.709
The other one's getting up. He's leaning forward
now, inspecting the one who was there keeping watch.

00:05:12.709 --> 00:05:15.189
TRAVIS: I can cast Sleep.

00:05:15.189 --> 00:05:16.620
LAURA: Do it!

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:19.861
DARIN: I can use Misty Step. Can I? To sneak
over.

00:05:19.861 --> 00:05:21.820
MATT: You could appear right behind him if you
wanted to.

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:23.932
DARIN: I would like to use Misty Step.

00:05:23.932 --> 00:05:29.411
MATT: All right, so, as you're doing this, you
slip into the shadows and quickly dart through the

00:05:29.411 --> 00:05:34.610
shadow, appearing behind the one who's waking up.
He's like, "What in the--?" What are you going to do?

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:38.976
DARIN: I speak for Sauron. And I try to rip his
throat out.

00:05:38.976 --> 00:05:40.678
TRAVIS: Oh shit.

00:05:40.678 --> 00:05:43.711
LAURA: Rip it out quietly!

00:05:43.711 --> 00:05:45.290
TRAVIS: Shh!

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:48.350
MATT: Make a grapple check. So go ahead and roll
athletics.

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:54.157
DAVIS: 16, plus my strength? 19.

00:05:54.157 --> 00:06:00.093
MATT: All right, so, as it's sitting up from its
weird, tattered bedroll, you whisper in its ear,

00:06:00.093 --> 00:06:04.631
"I speak for Sauron." Grab the back of its head.
Go ahead and roll an attack to try and bite into

00:06:04.631 --> 00:06:06.092
its throat.

00:06:06.092 --> 00:06:09.387
DARIN: That is 13.

00:06:09.387 --> 00:06:13.173
MATT: 13? Roll damage.

00:06:13.173 --> 00:06:16.742
DARIN: Seven.

00:06:16.742 --> 00:06:24.291
MATT: Okay. Seven points. All right. As you pull
the head back and bite into the throat, it's like

00:06:24.291 --> 00:06:28.833
(gurgling and gasping). You tear a chunk out of
its throat, but it's making all these gurgling

00:06:28.833 --> 00:06:32.037
noises. All the other uruks start rousing.

00:06:32.037 --> 00:06:34.763
LAURA: You should snap its neck! It's quieter!

00:06:34.763 --> 00:06:36.354
MATT: So what do you want to do?

00:06:36.354 --> 00:06:38.965
DARIN: I have another attack. I'm going to bite
his neck again.

00:06:38.965 --> 00:06:40.855
MATT: Go for it.

00:06:40.855 --> 00:06:43.292
LAURA: He's a creative one, Mozuu.

00:06:43.292 --> 00:06:49.936
DARIN: You see, Mozuu the Chosen means, I choose
one thing and I do it over and over again, and

00:06:49.936 --> 00:06:53.784
that's it. That's it! That's what Sauron said. It
is a 13.

00:06:53.784 --> 00:06:55.901
MATT: 13, all right. Go ahead and roll damage.
Second time.

00:06:55.901 --> 00:07:00.994
DARIN: For the love of Pete's Dragon. Okay, that
is another seven because that's what happens.

00:07:00.994 --> 00:07:03.105
TRAVIS: I thought he said quietly!

00:07:03.105 --> 00:07:06.809
MATT: All right, as you go, (growling) Still
alive. Bite down again and pull out another

00:07:06.809 --> 00:07:12.037
piece. You're taking chunks out of this orc's
throat but it's still alive. It's like (yelling),

00:07:12.037 --> 00:07:16.538
reaching up and grabbing at you now, and it's got
the back of your head and is trying to pull you

00:07:16.538 --> 00:07:19.709
onto the ground. All the other ones are rousing
and grabbing their weapons.

00:07:19.709 --> 00:07:21.621
LAURA: I think they know we're here.

00:07:21.621 --> 00:07:24.156
SAM: Are they up? Are they behind a wall?

00:07:24.156 --> 00:07:28.495
MATT: They're in an alcove, like a little
cliffside platform at the side of the mountain.

00:07:28.495 --> 00:07:33.333
There's a mountain wall and then an outcropping,
and they're on the outcropping. It's hidden,

00:07:33.333 --> 00:07:35.295
recessed. Below you.

00:07:35.295 --> 00:07:40.266
SAM: Below us! Oh, we're coming in from the
mountain. So we can jump down.

00:07:40.266 --> 00:07:42.066
MATT: If you want to try.

00:07:42.066 --> 00:07:44.668
LAURA: We didn't take a short rest, though.

00:07:44.668 --> 00:07:46.117
MATT: It's about 25 feet down below.

00:07:46.117 --> 00:07:47.637
LAURA: That would've been real smart.

00:07:47.637 --> 00:07:49.292
DARIN: To be fair, they know &lt;i&gt;I'm&lt;/i&gt; here.

00:07:49.292 --> 00:07:51.896
LAURA: Maybe I should rest while this is going on
because I should really rest.

00:07:51.896 --> 00:07:53.662
TRAVIS: I'll cast Sleep on them.

00:07:53.662 --> 00:07:55.907
MATT: So you pull out a small pouch--

00:07:55.907 --> 00:08:02.186
TRAVIS: Yeah, with like, sleeping powder and
herbs. I untie the top of it and I go, (whoosh).

00:08:02.186 --> 00:08:07.795
MATT: All righty. So--

00:08:07.795 --> 00:08:09.208
LAURA: You're going to sleep too!

00:08:09.208 --> 00:08:11.108
TRAVIS: Oh shit, well, I'm sure--

00:08:11.108 --> 00:08:13.619
MATT: All right, roll 5d8.

00:08:13.619 --> 00:08:15.844
LAURA: Wow, 5d8?!

00:08:15.844 --> 00:08:19.560
DARIN: Orc throat makes me sleepy.

00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:24.479
LAURA: It's 5d8 of--? Oh, okay, I know.

00:08:24.479 --> 00:08:27.807
TRAVIS: 32.

00:08:27.807 --> 00:08:36.090
MATT: 32. So two of the uruk that are getting up
out of bed are like, (grunt) reach for their

00:08:36.090 --> 00:08:42.007
weapons, and are like (grunting, then snoring),
and fall immediately back to sleep. The other

00:08:42.007 --> 00:08:44.468
three, however, are still rousing up from their
slumber.

00:08:44.468 --> 00:08:45.717
TRAVIS: The other three are?

00:08:45.717 --> 00:08:46.737
MATT: Yeah.

00:08:46.737 --> 00:08:48.298
TRAVIS: That's the best I got.

00:08:48.298 --> 00:08:50.880
MATT: At this point, combat is definitely engaged.
I need you all to roll initiative.

00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:54.219
DARIN: And I'm okay? I did not fall asleep?

00:08:54.219 --> 00:08:58.488
MATT: Well, no, because it affects creatures with
the lower hit dice, and you actually have a higher

00:08:58.488 --> 00:09:00.685
hit point value than most of them there. So you
weren't affected.

00:09:00.685 --> 00:09:03.830
TRAVIS: And I choose? I choose which one--

00:09:03.830 --> 00:09:04.979
LAURA: No.

00:09:04.979 --> 00:09:06.124
DARIN: 14.

00:09:06.124 --> 00:09:08.088
TRAVIS: It says I choose--

00:09:08.088 --> 00:09:09.708
SAM: Well, it doesn't matter.

00:09:09.708 --> 00:09:10.798
MATT: All right.

00:09:10.798 --> 00:09:12.376
SAM: Seven.

00:09:12.376 --> 00:09:14.011
MATT: Seven, all righty.

00:09:14.011 --> 00:09:15.478
LAURA: Eight.

00:09:15.478 --> 00:09:16.874
MATT: All righty.

00:09:16.874 --> 00:09:26.053
TRAVIS: 21. I need to be a little intelligent
bastard from now on.

00:09:26.053 --> 00:09:35.380
MATT: All righty. So Skak, you're up first. You
just threw the sleep powder into the air. You

00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:38.946
watch as they get to their feet and begin to pull
their weapons out. It looks like the fray is on.

00:09:38.946 --> 00:09:41.157
You're at the top of the combat round. What do you
want to do?

00:09:41.157 --> 00:09:43.133
TRAVIS: I'll take the nearest one with my crossbow
and fire.

00:09:43.133 --> 00:09:44.376
MATT: Okay, go for it.

00:09:44.376 --> 00:09:48.628
TRAVIS: Is he within melee range of him, for sneak
attack? Probably not, because he's working on the

00:09:48.628 --> 00:09:50.069
guy with the throat, right?

00:09:50.069 --> 00:09:53.373
MATT: Yeah, the guy with the throat is the only
one that you have sneak attack on.

00:09:53.373 --> 00:09:54.830
TRAVIS: 15.

00:09:54.830 --> 00:09:56.181
MATT: 15 hits.

00:09:56.181 --> 00:10:01.165
TRAVIS: Nice. That does seven points of piercing
damage.

00:10:01.165 --> 00:10:02.631
MATT: All right.

00:10:02.631 --> 00:10:09.710
TRAVIS: Are we hopping off down a cliff, or are we
running in toward where they are?

00:10:09.710 --> 00:10:13.901
MATT: That's up to you. They're about 25 feet down
below on this cliff.

00:10:13.901 --> 00:10:15.825
TRAVIS: I'm going to stay up on my perch.

00:10:15.825 --> 00:10:18.554
MATT: Okay, stay up on your perch. Got you. You
still have a bonus action if you wanted to hide.

00:10:18.554 --> 00:10:22.521
TRAVIS: But I can only hide or disengage or--

00:10:22.521 --> 00:10:26.751
LAURA: You could hide so they can't see you.

00:10:26.751 --> 00:10:29.211
TRAVIS: Oh, well, let them see me.

00:10:29.211 --> 00:10:32.032
MATT: All right, there you go. So Skak is up in
the open. Mozuu, you're up.

00:10:32.032 --> 00:10:37.741
DARIN: Okay. I am going to keep ripping at the
man's-- Well, not the man. I'm going to keep

00:10:37.741 --> 00:10:38.700
ripping him.

00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:40.723
MATT: The uruk, so go ahead for the attack.

00:10:40.723 --> 00:10:43.248
DARIN: Oh, for the love of Pete's Dragon. Five.

00:10:43.248 --> 00:10:46.722
MATT: Five. You go to bite and this time it's
reached over and it's grabbed a blade and a dagger.

00:10:46.722 --> 00:10:51.056
It jams the pommel up into your mouth and it hits
the roof of your mouth. (gagging) You're now being

00:10:51.056 --> 00:10:56.171
partially choked by its blade, by the hilt of its
blade. So your first strike does not hit it. You

00:10:56.171 --> 00:10:57.391
want to try a second time?

00:10:57.391 --> 00:11:00.251
DARIN: Yes. And I have a blade in my mouth?

00:11:00.251 --> 00:11:05.722
MATT: You have the pommel and hilt jammed up into
your jaw and it's trying to keep you at bay.

00:11:05.722 --> 00:11:10.561
DARIN: I'm going to try and jab the pommel in its
eye. No, it's not stuck in my mouth, right?

00:11:10.561 --> 00:11:12.489
MATT: Not at the moment, but you could bite down
if you wanted.

00:11:12.489 --> 00:11:16.789
DARIN: All right, I will. For the-- Seven.

00:11:16.789 --> 00:11:21.823
MATT: Seven. You try and bite down on it. Actually
breaks a tooth on the inside and you're like,

00:11:21.823 --> 00:11:27.591
"Ugh!" You feel the pain sting through your jaw.
This is a stronger uruk than you expected and it's

00:11:27.591 --> 00:11:30.568
currently putting up quite a fight. So that ends
your turn, Mozuu?

00:11:30.568 --> 00:11:31.737
DARIN: Ends my turn.

00:11:31.737 --> 00:11:36.627
MATT: All right. Arby and this group are all going
at the same time. So what are you doing, Arby?

00:11:36.627 --> 00:11:44.597
LAURA: I'm going to jump down. I'm going to run at
them and attack the one that's got him.

00:11:44.597 --> 00:11:51.305
MATT: Okay. So as you leap, make an acrobatics
check.

00:11:51.305 --> 00:11:52.603
LAURA: Oh no.

00:11:52.603 --> 00:11:53.892
TRAVIS: How far? 25 feet down?

00:11:53.892 --> 00:11:55.216
MATT: 25 feet, yeah.

00:11:55.216 --> 00:11:57.591
LAURA: Four!

00:11:57.591 --> 00:12:02.750
TRAVIS: Plus anything? Oh no!

00:12:02.750 --> 00:12:04.732
MATT: Mozuu, make a dexterity saving throw.

00:12:04.732 --> 00:12:06.532
TRAVIS: Oh, no way.

00:12:06.532 --> 00:12:13.873
DARIN: 18 plus-- that's a
19.

00:12:13.873 --> 00:12:18.052
MATT: Okay. So you suffer seven points of
bludgeoning damage as you fall from the cliffside

00:12:18.052 --> 00:12:23.992
above. As you fall, you land like a large
cannonball, right in the space where Mozuu was.

00:12:23.992 --> 00:12:28.600
Mozuu, at the last minute, mouth filled with gore
and dagger, looks up and sees the shadow

00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:32.452
encroaching. Kicks away just as you (impact).

00:12:32.452 --> 00:12:35.763
LAURA: Slam down with my maul right as I hit the
ground!

00:12:35.763 --> 00:12:41.344
MATT: You land right on the guy he had. So you
slam the maul into the ground, because you don't

00:12:41.344 --> 00:12:45.751
know where he is. You look around for a moment to
look down and realize that your feet are six

00:12:45.751 --> 00:12:52.804
inches deep into the torso of this once-living orc
that has been splattered on the ledge. All right.

00:12:52.804 --> 00:12:55.774
LAURA: I'll use my second attack to hit another
one!

00:12:55.774 --> 00:12:57.282
MATT: All right, go for it.

00:12:57.282 --> 00:12:59.173
TRAVIS: You are slaughtering today.

00:12:59.173 --> 00:13:03.482
LAURA: I'm screaming as I'm doing it. 24!

00:13:03.482 --> 00:13:05.044
MATT: 24 hits.

00:13:05.044 --> 00:13:13.035
LAURA: Deet de deet de deet. Ooh, ah! 15!

00:13:13.035 --> 00:13:25.473
MATT: 15? All right. That'll destroy him. All
right, so. So it was seven from that one to, okay.

00:13:25.473 --> 00:13:31.568
As you land and crush him, you swing wide with
your giant maul and it hits one and pins it

00:13:31.568 --> 00:13:36.084
against the wall. It hits it and slams against the
wall. You watch it splatter across the side,

00:13:36.084 --> 00:13:37.674
destroyed.

00:13:37.674 --> 00:13:39.634
LAURA: Like a gnat, that one! Ha ha, ha!

00:13:39.634 --> 00:13:45.653
MATT: All right, that'll end your turn, Arby? As
that's happening, the orcs are getting up and

00:13:45.653 --> 00:13:51.273
grabbing their weapons. There are the two still
sleeping. As all this is happening, they're

00:13:51.273 --> 00:13:57.142
(snoring) in the middle of their bedroll. These
two other ones that are wounded are going to stand

00:13:57.142 --> 00:14:01.884
up. They're both going to go after you since
you're the one who just arrived aggressively. The

00:14:01.884 --> 00:14:05.117
first one's going to swing at you.

00:14:05.117 --> 00:14:06.594
TRAVIS: Frustrated DM.

00:14:06.594 --> 00:14:08.057
MATT: That's a ten.

00:14:08.057 --> 00:14:09.123
LAURA: No.

00:14:09.123 --> 00:14:14.014
MATT: The side of their battleaxe, clang! Against
your armor, no effect. A natural 20!

00:14:14.014 --> 00:14:18.373
TRAVIS: There's the make-up. There it is.

00:14:18.373 --> 00:14:21.273
LAURA: That's a load of shrak, that is!

00:14:21.273 --> 00:14:25.244
MATT: One on a d10, so that's two plus-- You take
five points of slashing damage from its critical

00:14:25.244 --> 00:14:31.897
hit. You deflect it with a chuckle, your giant
olog-hai physical self able to withstand such

00:14:31.897 --> 00:14:35.154
paltry blows. You're called Unstoppable for a
reason.

00:14:35.154 --> 00:14:37.444
LAURA: That's right. Unbreakable. That's me.

00:14:37.444 --> 00:14:42.148
MATT: All right, so. That ends the orc's turn
there, the one you crushed there, the one that's

00:14:42.148 --> 00:14:51.238
sleeping. Yeah, they don't get a saving throw
until they get hit or the spell ends. Fun. All

00:14:51.238 --> 00:14:58.506
right. There's a third orc right now that's
backing away. Hands up, full belly shown, like

00:14:58.506 --> 00:14:59.844
(heavy breathing).

00:14:59.844 --> 00:15:01.348
LAURA: Kill the weak one!

00:15:01.348 --> 00:15:04.980
MATT: "No, no no!" Eden, your turn.

00:15:04.980 --> 00:15:06.517
SAM: I will jump on the weak one.

00:15:06.517 --> 00:15:10.694
MATT: Roll an acrobatics check, please.

00:15:10.694 --> 00:15:16.475
SAM: Oh boy. Check? 15.

00:15:16.475 --> 00:15:22.340
MATT: 15, all right. You land on it without issue
and you actually reduce the damage from the impact

00:15:22.340 --> 00:15:26.802
to two. You only take two points of bludgeoning
damage from the fall as you land on top of it. Go

00:15:26.802 --> 00:15:29.390
ahead and roll a d4. Add your strength modifier.

00:15:29.390 --> 00:15:31.721
SAM: d4, add strength.

00:15:31.721 --> 00:15:35.519
MATT: Oh god, which one is it?

00:15:35.519 --> 00:15:40.619
SAM: Three, plus strength is one. So four!

00:15:40.619 --> 00:15:45.467
MATT: Four, so. You land and it slams onto the
ground. We'll see if it manages-- Nope! It's

00:15:45.467 --> 00:15:51.590
knocked prone. So it falls onto the ground. You're
on top of it currently. Felt a bone snap somewhere

00:15:51.590 --> 00:15:55.788
in its ribcage, the back of its shoulder blade.
It's currently pinned onto the ground underneath you.

00:15:55.788 --> 00:15:59.270
SAM: I will take my quarterstaff and-- like
churning butter.

00:15:59.270 --> 00:16:08.537
MATT: All right, go ahead and roll some attacks.
It is considered prone, so you have advantage on

00:16:08.537 --> 00:16:10.238
your attacks against it.

00:16:10.238 --> 00:16:13.720
SAM: Good, because that was a two. And that's a
natural 20!

00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:16.890
MATT: Oh, shit! Okay, so roll your first attack
damage.

00:16:16.890 --> 00:16:20.150
SAM: d8, seven, plus four. 11.

00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:23.875
LAURA: Wait, seven times two, because it was a
critical. So 14.

00:16:23.875 --> 00:16:26.131
SAM: 14 plus four is 18.

00:16:26.131 --> 00:16:31.899
MATT: Okay, so the first hit, as you jam down, you
go to stir it. You hit right at the base of the

00:16:31.899 --> 00:16:36.010
skull and the neck breaks immediately. But you
feel like you still have to go through the motion

00:16:36.010 --> 00:16:39.996
so you still stir inside, even though it's not
living. The body's limp and being pushed around in

00:16:39.996 --> 00:16:42.470
a circle. You're like, (yelling in disgust).

00:16:42.470 --> 00:16:44.711
TRAVIS: What's it look like, being pushed around
in a circle?

00:16:44.711 --> 00:16:48.410
MATT: (yelling) About like that. So that's your
first strike.

00:16:48.410 --> 00:16:50.120
SAM: Well, is he dead?

00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:53.108
MATT: Yes. He's very dead.

00:16:53.108 --> 00:17:00.371
SAM: Orc physiology is not my specialty. Do I see
other orcs? Uruks, around me?

00:17:00.371 --> 00:17:05.702
MATT: There are two sleeping and there is one that
was first struck by you with your crossbow, that

00:17:05.702 --> 00:17:09.150
was wounded, but it's still standing and its
blade's out.

00:17:09.150 --> 00:17:10.959
SAM: I get one more attack, right?

00:17:10.959 --> 00:17:12.155
MATT: You do.

00:17:12.155 --> 00:17:16.895
SAM: I will move to that one and hit him. Right?

00:17:16.895 --> 00:17:20.450
MATT: Okay, what's your movement?

00:17:20.450 --> 00:17:21.421
SAM: 40.

00:17:21.421 --> 00:17:24.311
MATT: Actually, yes. You would have enough,
because you are quicker than the other. So you

00:17:24.311 --> 00:17:26.857
have enough speed to get right up to him. Go ahead
and make your second attack.

00:17:26.857 --> 00:17:28.421
LAURA: You're so speedy.

00:17:28.421 --> 00:17:29.697
SAM: Not with advantage?

00:17:29.697 --> 00:17:30.800
MATT: No.

00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:32.887
SAM: That's probably a miss. It's a nine.

00:17:32.887 --> 00:17:39.230
MATT: Yep. This one sees you crush his friend and
stir him up a bit, and prepares itself. As you

00:17:39.230 --> 00:17:44.198
rush toward, darts out of the way and dodge-rolls
beyond your attack. No effect.

00:17:44.198 --> 00:17:51.316
SAM: It's a wraith! It's a grave-walker! They can
disappear at will!

00:17:51.316 --> 00:17:54.410
MATT: All right, so, that ends Eden's turn. Skak,
you're up first.

00:17:54.410 --> 00:17:58.222
TRAVIS: The last one that remains un-asleep:
crossbow.

00:17:58.222 --> 00:17:59.414
MATT: Go for it.

00:17:59.414 --> 00:18:02.041
TRAVIS: Nice. Is he now within melee of him?

00:18:02.041 --> 00:18:03.500
MATT: He is, yes.

00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:14.544
TRAVIS: 17, so I'll use my sneak attack. 12,
that's an eight. 12, 16, 20!

00:18:14.544 --> 00:18:18.381
MATT: Yeah, between the damage he already took--
This one, the arrow strikes right in the abdomen.

00:18:18.381 --> 00:18:24.486
It clutches it, gets the axe up to its side, and
you see it, with its final bit of strength, trying

00:18:24.486 --> 00:18:30.048
to strike a blow toward your olog friend over
there, but crumples to the ground and bleeds out

00:18:30.048 --> 00:18:31.513
from its abdomen.

00:18:31.513 --> 00:18:33.431
SAM: Thanks, Skak!

00:18:33.431 --> 00:18:41.223
TRAVIS: Yeah. Now, quiet-- I'm looking at you--
quietly kill the other, and leave one for

00:18:41.223 --> 00:18:42.659
questioning!

00:18:42.659 --> 00:18:44.704
SAM: Kill the other? There's two asleep.

00:18:44.704 --> 00:18:47.963
LAURA: I walk over and use my maul and smash down
on one of the ones that's sleeping.

00:18:47.963 --> 00:18:52.552
MATT: Okay, make an attack with advantage. It's an
auto-crit because it is incapacitated.

00:18:52.552 --> 00:18:57.896
LAURA: Ooh, 16 plus eight, so that's definitely
going to hit, and it's not a crit.

00:18:57.896 --> 00:19:01.703
MATT: No, it is a crit. It's an auto-crit because
it's right there. Actually, you wouldn't even have

00:19:01.703 --> 00:19:09.203
to roll because, when it's incapacitated. No,
attack rolls have advantage, you're right. And

00:19:09.203 --> 00:19:12.672
within five feet, it's a critical hit. So yeah,
you did hit and you have a crit.

00:19:12.672 --> 00:19:16.637
TRAVIS: Re-roll that. That'll do.

00:19:16.637 --> 00:19:19.547
LAURA: Yeah! 20 plus five, 25!

00:19:19.547 --> 00:19:28.291
MATT: (snoring) (impact) Scattered. Gallagher
performance. All of you are like (splatter).

00:19:28.291 --> 00:19:30.772
SAM: A good kill.

00:19:30.772 --> 00:19:38.173
MATT: The one sleeping now has this section of
hand that slopped onto its head. Pulls it in,

00:19:38.173 --> 00:19:40.565
cuddles with the disembodied orc arm.

00:19:40.565 --> 00:19:42.454
TRAVIS: Sucks the thumb.

00:19:42.454 --> 00:19:45.438
SAM: Sucking somebody else's thumb! That's so
gross!

00:19:45.438 --> 00:19:51.205
TRAVIS: How do I get down? I'm tiny!

00:19:51.205 --> 00:19:53.553
LAURA: Here! I'll catch you!

00:19:53.553 --> 00:19:58.942
SAM: We'll catch you, just come down. Oh, wait! I
have a blanket. Let's spread it out and we'll hold

00:19:58.942 --> 00:20:01.213
it, and you can jump down on the blanket.

00:20:01.213 --> 00:20:03.242
TRAVIS: Don't let me fall!

00:20:03.242 --> 00:20:07.141
LAURA: No, of course not! Right as he jumps, I let
go and start picking my nose.

00:20:07.141 --> 00:20:09.623
MATT: Make an acrobatics check.

00:20:09.623 --> 00:20:16.954
TRAVIS: Oh no. Oh, hey! 17! Trickster rogues, man,
okay!

00:20:16.954 --> 00:20:25.143
MATT: All right, so, as you leap off and watch one
of three taut points on it vanish, you flap your

00:20:25.143 --> 00:20:30.624
arms really fast to try and maneuver through the
air. You manage to hit some tension on their side

00:20:30.624 --> 00:20:37.015
and roll off. You only suffer three points of
bludgeoning damage as you roll on the ground. As

00:20:37.015 --> 00:20:39.924
you land, I want you to roll a constitution saving
throw.

00:20:39.924 --> 00:20:42.668
SAM: What's that all about? Oh, I know what it
is.

00:20:42.668 --> 00:20:44.735
TRAVIS: Oh, that's not good. That's a six.

00:20:44.735 --> 00:20:51.941
MATT: All right, so, as you roll and land, the
sleeping powder seems to have worn off. The one

00:20:51.941 --> 00:20:55.515
that's on the ground, clutching and sucking on the
thumb of the disembodied uruk arm goes,

00:20:55.515 --> 00:21:07.889
(sniffing and grunting) (confused noises) (cry of alarm).

00:21:07.889 --> 00:21:09.407
TRAVIS: Grab him!

00:21:09.407 --> 00:21:10.882
SAM: We're not to kill him?

00:21:10.882 --> 00:21:12.225
TRAVIS: No! Question him!

00:21:12.225 --> 00:21:16.723
DARIN: We will question him, and we will question
him in the patented way we always question

00:21:16.723 --> 00:21:21.934
individuals, when we all speak as one!

00:21:21.934 --> 00:21:24.003
SAM, LAURA, and TRAVIS: As one!

00:21:24.003 --> 00:21:26.962
SAM, DARIN, and LAURA: Don't bite his throat.

00:21:26.962 --> 00:21:28.552
DARIN: Right.

00:21:28.552 --> 00:21:32.211
TRAVIS: You, strong people, grapple him!

00:21:32.211 --> 00:21:33.532
SAM: I will grapple him!

00:21:33.532 --> 00:21:35.503
MATT: Make an athletics check.

00:21:35.503 --> 00:21:38.767
SAM: Not good. Nine.

00:21:38.767 --> 00:21:44.117
MATT: Natural 19. As you go to grab, he goes
(yelling), pulls away. You can attempt to make

00:21:44.117 --> 00:21:47.142
another, if you want. You get two attacks. You can
make one per attack.

00:21:47.142 --> 00:21:50.664
SAM: That's right. This one is, it's an athletics
check? 13.

00:21:50.664 --> 00:21:55.761
MATT: 13. Yeah, no, he's like, (grunting), pushes
away from you twice. This slimy little orc is now

00:21:55.761 --> 00:21:56.925
freaked out.

00:21:56.925 --> 00:21:59.782
LAURA: I start grabbing at him like it's a piece
of paper blowing in the wind.

00:21:59.782 --> 00:22:03.768
MATT: Make an athletics check. It's like (slurping
sounds).

00:22:03.768 --> 00:22:08.506
LAURA: Oh no! Athletics, or what? Athletics is
ten.

00:22:08.506 --> 00:22:15.185
MATT: Ten. Nope! It's like grabbing the soap.
Boop, boop, boop! It keeps slipping out of your

00:22:15.185 --> 00:22:16.655
grasp and it's crawling on the ground.

00:22:16.655 --> 00:22:18.015
LAURA: 25!

00:22:18.015 --> 00:22:23.145
MATT: 25. Okay, yeah, that'll do it. It slips past
each one, crawling on the ground,

00:22:23.145 --> 00:22:27.505
(heavy breathing) (clunk) "Ugh!" You get the ankle and
you pull it back in. Slides onto his back and is

00:22:27.505 --> 00:22:31.995
like, (panicked yelling) underneath this giant
olog body, covered in armor, that's towering over

00:22:31.995 --> 00:22:33.845
it. Looking up at you, Arby, like--

00:22:33.845 --> 00:22:36.740
LAURA: We're going to ask you some questions.

00:22:36.740 --> 00:22:39.673
TRAVIS: All together, right? One, two--

00:22:39.673 --> 00:22:59.747
ALL: --Three. Who do you serve? We are the Forcs!
Who do you serve? Not meaning food! Because we are

00:22:59.747 --> 00:23:01.615
the Forcs!

00:23:01.615 --> 00:23:04.772
MATT: Somebody make an intimidation check.

00:23:04.772 --> 00:23:07.534
TRAVIS: Not me.

00:23:07.534 --> 00:23:10.702
SAM: I will intimidate. Natural one.

00:23:10.702 --> 00:23:12.287
LAURA: Seven.

00:23:12.287 --> 00:23:14.736
TRAVIS: Nine.

00:23:14.736 --> 00:23:17.138
DARIN: (softly) Two.

00:23:17.138 --> 00:23:19.392
TRAVIS: Oh my god. Are you serious?

00:23:19.392 --> 00:23:29.084
MATT: After this display, the uruk on the ground
goes, (bursts into laughter). "What is this? What,

00:23:29.084 --> 00:23:35.656
"the Forcs? Really? (giggling) Just kill me."

00:23:35.656 --> 00:23:38.866
SAM: I guess we have to kill him.

00:23:38.866 --> 00:23:40.341
TRAVIS: Give him pain.

00:23:40.341 --> 00:23:41.386
SAM: Pain?

00:23:41.386 --> 00:23:42.410
TRAVIS: Pain.

00:23:42.410 --> 00:23:49.286
LAURA: I lift him up, hanging by his ankle. Do we
want to use him as a piñata?

00:23:49.286 --> 00:23:57.666
SAM: It's multicultural. Sure! I'll take out my
length of chain and sort of start whipping him.

00:23:57.666 --> 00:24:00.868
MATT: (shrieking)

00:24:00.868 --> 00:24:04.696
LAURA: Who do you serve? Who do you work for?

00:24:04.696 --> 00:24:14.423
MATT: "My! Name's! Borg! Please, stop it! I'm
Borg!"

00:24:14.423 --> 00:24:18.029
LAURA &amp;amp; DARIN: Borg. Borg? Borg borg.

00:24:18.029 --> 00:24:25.259
LAURA: Who sent you? Where are you from? Who do
you work for?

00:24:25.259 --> 00:24:27.219
SAM: We're looking for Ur-Gram.

00:24:27.219 --> 00:24:29.785
MATT: "I know Ur-Gram!"

00:24:29.785 --> 00:24:32.519
SAM: You do! Where's Ur-Gram?

00:24:32.519 --> 00:24:36.379
MATT: (stuttering) "I could tell you. I could show
you!"

00:24:36.379 --> 00:24:38.150
LAURA: All right! I drop him.

00:24:38.150 --> 00:24:51.348
MATT: "Oh! (groaning) Okay. I could show you. So.
Just know, Ur-Gram is strange. He's a fanatic. Bit

00:24:51.348 --> 00:24:54.608
"of a creepy individual."

00:24:54.608 --> 00:25:03.724
LAURA: Should we take a short rest while we talk
about him? Can I sit down? I'm going to sit down

00:25:03.724 --> 00:25:05.929
and listen to what he's saying.

00:25:05.929 --> 00:25:12.330
MATT: This uruk, which at a close glance is small,
it's borderline goblin in how thin and tiny it is,

00:25:12.330 --> 00:25:24.651
sits up on his feet. (wheezing) "A fanatic,
Ur-Gram is. Near death once, he was! Now works for

00:25:24.651 --> 00:25:32.768
"some tark who walks like the wraiths do. The
Bright Lord, he is. Marks all his gobs with his

00:25:32.768 --> 00:25:40.698
"hand, he does. I don't question, though. Ur-Gram
can break any of us. I've seen it, I have."

00:25:40.698 --> 00:25:44.488
LAURA: He can't break me. I'm unbreakable.

00:25:44.488 --> 00:25:46.047
MATT: "That's good."

00:25:46.047 --> 00:25:48.588
TRAVIS: You said he works for the Bright Lord?

00:25:48.588 --> 00:25:54.150
MATT: "The Bright Lord, aye. I've seen him around.
He's just some stupid man-filth."

00:25:54.150 --> 00:25:55.693
TRAVIS: Pig-skin!

00:25:55.693 --> 00:25:57.109
SAM: Soft-skin!

00:25:57.109 --> 00:25:59.269
LAURA: Man-swine!

00:25:59.269 --> 00:26:02.785
SAM: Sure, sure, those are all good ones.

00:26:02.785 --> 00:26:05.360
DARIN: What other ones can we use?

00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:07.668
SAM: Man-filth! Man-beast!

00:26:07.668 --> 00:26:10.140
MATT: "I already said man-filth."

00:26:10.140 --> 00:26:18.459
DARIN: Now, what other insults could we use, all
together, in one voice? In our traditional way?

00:26:18.459 --> 00:26:22.239
MATT: "Please, don't. Borg is asking you."

00:26:22.239 --> 00:26:27.750
DARIN: You see, we're tougher than your master.
You said creepy? Who's creepier than the Forcs?

00:26:27.750 --> 00:26:29.906
You can answer.

00:26:29.906 --> 00:26:31.340
MATT: "No one?"

00:26:31.340 --> 00:26:33.720
SAM: Correct answer.

00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:41.510
DARIN: There's two things I know. We are the
creepiest, and that's it.

00:26:41.510 --> 00:26:44.011
MATT: (whimpering)

00:26:44.011 --> 00:26:48.908
TRAVIS: So Ur-Gram works for the Bright Lord and
can bend anyone to his will?

00:26:48.908 --> 00:26:52.948
MATT: "Well, didn't bend me. Didn't ask."

00:26:52.948 --> 00:26:54.558
SAM: Where is he?

00:26:54.558 --> 00:26:56.062
MATT: "I'll show you."

00:26:56.062 --> 00:27:02.335
LAURA: Can you show us in 30 minutes? Because I
want to take a short break.

00:27:02.335 --> 00:27:05.332
MATT: "Sure, take your rest."

00:27:05.332 --> 00:27:08.073
SAM: If we rest, what if they send a patrol up
here?

00:27:08.073 --> 00:27:11.142
LAURA: We'll pretend that we're the guards that we
just killed.

00:27:11.142 --> 00:27:17.072
TRAVIS: You lead us to Ur-Gram, we'll rest for a
minute, and then when you lead us we'll let you leave!

00:27:17.072 --> 00:27:19.051
MATT: "Okay."

00:27:19.051 --> 00:27:22.601
LAURA: I'm going to use him as a pillow as I take
a short rest.

00:27:22.601 --> 00:27:28.006
TRAVIS: I'm going to bind his hands first, and
then I'm going to stick some dirty garments

00:27:28.006 --> 00:27:32.022
hanging off of Eden in his mouth, to gag him up.

00:27:32.022 --> 00:27:39.810
DARIN: You have a choice, mate. You could join us.
Every Forc, as has been proven by science, has

00:27:39.810 --> 00:27:47.405
five forky things. We are but four! If you join
us, we will be five.

00:27:47.405 --> 00:27:48.874
LAURA: No, but then we'd be--

00:27:48.874 --> 00:27:50.730
SAM: --the Fircs.

00:27:50.730 --> 00:27:59.323
LAURA: Doesn't work as well. If you join us, you
could be my pillow as long as you want.

00:27:59.323 --> 00:28:01.350
MATT: (muffled whimpering)

00:28:01.350 --> 00:28:03.091
TRAVIS: Hold on. I take out the--

00:28:03.091 --> 00:28:07.464
LAURA: I fluff him up and lay down.

00:28:07.464 --> 00:28:10.791
MATT: (yelps of pain) You break a few bones in the
process.

00:28:10.791 --> 00:28:16.720
TRAVIS: I should gag him back up. I walk back over
to Eden and I tear off a bit of cloth near the

00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:23.652
groin area. Yeah, I put it back in. Okay, should
we take a short rest?

00:28:23.652 --> 00:28:25.203
SAM: I guess.

00:28:25.203 --> 00:28:28.972
MATT: All right, so you guys all take a short
rest. You can use any hit dice that are currently

00:28:28.972 --> 00:28:30.402
unspent.

00:28:30.402 --> 00:28:34.532
SAM: Got to use them all.

00:28:34.532 --> 00:28:36.791
TRAVIS: Because you have those hit dice once per
day.

00:28:36.791 --> 00:28:40.071
SAM: Back up at full.

00:28:40.071 --> 00:28:43.572
MATT: You get your ki back. You get your action
surge back.

00:28:43.572 --> 00:28:46.893
DARIN: Almost full.

00:28:46.893 --> 00:28:48.874
LAURA: Almost full, not quite.

00:28:48.874 --> 00:28:52.909
MATT: All right. At the end of this rest, as
you're laying back, you hear this silent

00:28:52.909 --> 00:28:55.671
whimpering as Borg's like (whimpering).

00:28:55.671 --> 00:28:57.342
LAURA: It's okay, Borg-borg.

00:28:57.342 --> 00:29:01.991
TRAVIS: Oh man, pet names.

00:29:01.991 --> 00:29:04.425
LAURA: Well, he said his name twice!

00:29:04.425 --> 00:29:06.862
TRAVIS: Pet names for our captive.

00:29:06.862 --> 00:29:09.131
SAM: Lead us to Ur-Gram.

00:29:09.131 --> 00:29:11.034
MATT: "I need to get up first."

00:29:11.034 --> 00:29:12.681
TRAVIS: You've got a gag in your mouth.

00:29:12.681 --> 00:29:14.118
MATT: (muffled)

00:29:14.118 --> 00:29:15.555
TRAVIS: Now hold on!

00:29:15.555 --> 00:29:18.273
MATT: "Blah! I need to get up first!"

00:29:18.273 --> 00:29:19.718
SAM: Let him up.

00:29:19.718 --> 00:29:21.268
LAURA: All right, I sit up.

00:29:21.268 --> 00:29:23.464
MATT: (gasping and heavy breathing)

00:29:23.464 --> 00:29:30.458
LAURA: You're very comfy. I start taking his ropes
off him as I pat his little head.

00:29:30.458 --> 00:29:32.906
TRAVIS: Oh, why are you untying his hands?

00:29:32.906 --> 00:29:35.680
LAURA: Well, because I thought he needs to walk?

00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:37.955
TRAVIS: They're on his hands!

00:29:37.955 --> 00:29:41.719
LAURA: I don't understand what the problem is.

00:29:41.719 --> 00:29:46.941
TRAVIS: Now, I've made him a nice bit of jewelry
for his wrists. Let's leave it on so he feels like

00:29:46.941 --> 00:29:48.542
he's part of the group.

00:29:48.542 --> 00:29:49.550
LAURA: All right.

00:29:49.550 --> 00:29:52.396
TRAVIS: Okay. I tie his hands back together. In
front!

00:29:52.396 --> 00:29:55.763
LAURA: Should I undo his feet then?

00:29:55.763 --> 00:29:57.232
TRAVIS: Those were never tied.

00:29:57.232 --> 00:29:58.292
LAURA: Okay.

00:29:58.292 --> 00:30:07.113
MATT: As you guys continue eastward under the
cover of night, having crossed over the apex of

00:30:07.113 --> 00:30:12.692
this mountain range, you descend down the
treacherous paths and cliffs below. A few hours

00:30:12.692 --> 00:30:19.502
downward, continuing with the pushing of Borg
ahead of you, he begins to continuously glance out

00:30:19.502 --> 00:30:25.843
in the darkness ahead of you until eventually, you
come around one bend through this small valley

00:30:25.843 --> 00:30:33.246
path that's been carved through years and years of
heavy rains and wind that have burrowed this small

00:30:33.246 --> 00:30:38.749
walkway through these big cliff-sides. You turn
around the corner and you can see, immediately,

00:30:38.749 --> 00:30:46.540
about a dozen or so dotted lights in the distance,
the dark. Maybe a quarter-mile away. There, Borg

00:30:46.540 --> 00:30:57.067
goes, "That there! That's where he is! That's
where Ur-Gram and the tark have been preparing!"

00:30:57.067 --> 00:30:59.620
LAURA: Is the Bright Lord down there?

00:30:59.620 --> 00:31:01.074
MATT: "Maybe!"

00:31:01.074 --> 00:31:03.103
SAM: How do we get inside?

00:31:03.103 --> 00:31:07.108
MATT: "I don't know! I've only had to go outside
of it!"

00:31:07.108 --> 00:31:09.115
DARIN: You've never been inside?

00:31:09.115 --> 00:31:12.753
MATT: "Oh, well I've been inside, but they let me
in! Don't think they're going to do that for you."

00:31:12.753 --> 00:31:15.314
SAM: Is there a password or something?

00:31:15.314 --> 00:31:20.675
LAURA: Do all of you wear special hats or
something?

00:31:20.699 --> 00:31:30.294
MATT: "I mean--" He looks down at himself and
looks around. "They gave us these." He tugs at the

00:31:30.294 --> 00:31:38.246
tunic that he has under his ramshackle, piecemeal
armor. There's this soft grey material that has a

00:31:38.246 --> 00:31:45.894
dull grey handprint that's pulled across the
front. He goes, "Maybe this?"

00:31:45.894 --> 00:31:49.562
LAURA: That's pretty. I could wear that.

00:31:49.562 --> 00:31:51.167
SAM: You're big.

00:31:51.167 --> 00:31:57.066
DARIN: You said the other uruk were marked by this
Bright Lord?

00:31:57.066 --> 00:31:59.191
MATT: "Well, he gives them like, a--"

00:31:59.191 --> 00:32:04.196
DARIN: Does it leave a print on their face?

00:32:04.196 --> 00:32:05.814
MATT: "Don't think so."

00:32:05.814 --> 00:32:07.708
LAURA: You want me to give it a try?

00:32:07.708 --> 00:32:09.033
TRAVIS: Do it.

00:32:09.033 --> 00:32:12.399
LAURA: All right, I walk over to Mozuu and slap
him as hard as I can across the face.

00:32:12.399 --> 00:32:14.866
DARIN: How many hit points do I lose?

00:32:14.866 --> 00:32:16.793
MATT: What's your strength modifier?

00:32:16.793 --> 00:32:18.506
LAURA: Five.

00:32:18.506 --> 00:32:23.953
MATT: Your strength modifier is five? You take six
points of bludgeoning damage to the face, as your

00:32:23.953 --> 00:32:27.903
jaw actually disconnects from one side and
(cracking sound).

00:32:27.903 --> 00:32:30.163
TRAVIS: You are &lt;i&gt;huge&lt;/i&gt;. Oh my gosh.

00:32:30.163 --> 00:32:34.627
DARIN: (indistinct)

00:32:34.627 --> 00:32:36.954
LAURA: I can't understand you.

00:32:36.954 --> 00:32:38.751
TRAVIS: Is that what the mark looks like?

00:32:38.751 --> 00:32:42.206
MATT: "Yeah."

00:32:42.206 --> 00:32:49.458
TRAVIS: Can I make an insight check to see if he's
lying? Natural 20.

00:32:49.458 --> 00:32:55.847
MATT: Yeah, he's totally lying. He has no idea. He
watched you slap the shit out of your friend and

00:32:55.847 --> 00:32:57.567
is amused by it.

00:32:57.567 --> 00:33:04.527
TRAVIS: I've got an idea. What if we untie him
and he brings us in as new recruits to Ur-Gram?

00:33:04.527 --> 00:33:06.267
LAURA: And then what?

00:33:06.267 --> 00:33:10.277
TRAVIS: We'll get an audience with him and we cut
his head off! And then we bring it back.

00:33:10.277 --> 00:33:12.192
MATT: "I can hear you!"

00:33:12.192 --> 00:33:14.637
SAM: No, we're not going to cut &lt;i&gt;your&lt;/i&gt; head off!

00:33:14.637 --> 00:33:15.717
MATT: "Oh, oh!"

00:33:15.717 --> 00:33:18.235
LAURA: No, no, the Man-eater. The Face-eater.

00:33:18.235 --> 00:33:19.762
MATT: "I could do that! I could help you in."

00:33:19.762 --> 00:33:22.477
TRAVIS: And we'll cut you in on the spoils.

00:33:22.477 --> 00:33:24.820
LAURA: Good idea!

00:33:24.820 --> 00:33:32.678
SAM: We're going to get a lot of money for this
mission, and we'll give you one half.

00:33:32.678 --> 00:33:35.087
MATT: Make a deception check.

00:33:35.087 --> 00:33:39.203
TRAVIS: That's me, man! I actually have deception
for once!

00:33:39.203 --> 00:33:40.925
SAM: 15!

00:33:40.925 --> 00:33:51.096
MATT: He's like, "That's very generous. So then,
to Ur-Gram? Come on."

00:33:51.096 --> 00:33:54.338
DARIN: To Ur-Gram! May I fix my jaw?

00:33:54.338 --> 00:33:56.128
SAM: Oh, I can fix it! I'm a medic.

00:33:56.128 --> 00:33:57.154
DARIN: Thank you.

00:33:57.154 --> 00:33:58.557
MATT: Make a medicine check.

00:33:58.557 --> 00:34:05.214
SAM: That's cocked. 11 plus medicine? 14.

00:34:05.214 --> 00:34:11.620
MATT: 14? It takes a minute, but eventually
(cracking). It's sore. It's swollen. Your face

00:34:11.620 --> 00:34:13.068
looks disproportionate.

00:34:13.068 --> 00:34:14.812
DARIN: I feel alive.

00:34:14.812 --> 00:34:25.779
LAURA: I start yanking his robes off of his hands.
His robes off? His &lt;i&gt;ropes&lt;/i&gt; off of his hands. I'll

00:34:25.779 --> 00:34:27.775
take his robes off too, just in case.

00:34:27.775 --> 00:34:29.724
TRAVIS: Make him naked!

00:34:29.724 --> 00:34:33.735
SAM: He needs to have a costume on, for the ruse.

00:34:33.735 --> 00:34:39.368
LAURA: All right, I give him his robes back.
Sorry.

00:34:39.368 --> 00:34:46.993
SAM: Remember, you're bringing us in because we're
new recruits. You're here to see Ur-Gram. No

00:34:46.993 --> 00:34:48.189
questions.

00:34:48.189 --> 00:34:50.108
TRAVIS: Ferocious warriors, we are.

00:34:50.108 --> 00:34:53.918
SAM: The moment you betray us, we will kill you.

00:34:53.918 --> 00:34:55.097
MATT: "Right."

00:34:55.097 --> 00:34:56.398
TRAVIS: Painfully.

00:34:56.398 --> 00:34:58.799
SAM: And that's it.

00:34:58.799 --> 00:35:06.591
MATT: "Okay, good to know. Follow me!" Begins to
carefully dart around. You guys progress for about

00:35:06.591 --> 00:35:10.799
20 or so minutes before you reach the very base of
this mountain. It's now evened out and you're in

00:35:10.799 --> 00:35:16.820
this valley, where this small fortress is. The
closer you get, I want you to make a perception check.

00:35:16.820 --> 00:35:19.167
SAM: All of us?

00:35:19.167 --> 00:35:20.653
MATT: All of you guys.

00:35:20.653 --> 00:35:23.885
TRAVIS: 17.

00:35:23.885 --> 00:35:25.359
SAM: 17 here as well.

00:35:25.359 --> 00:35:27.077
LAURA: Ooh, 22.

00:35:27.077 --> 00:35:30.628
MATT: All right. Darin?

00:35:30.628 --> 00:35:31.813
DARIN: Plus what?

00:35:31.813 --> 00:35:32.779
MATT: Perception.

00:35:32.779 --> 00:35:33.825
LAURA: It's toward the bottom.

00:35:33.825 --> 00:35:36.227
DARIN: Oh, 14.

00:35:36.227 --> 00:35:42.016
MATT: All right, some decent rolls all around.
Okay, you guys can see, on the other side of this

00:35:42.016 --> 00:35:47.262
wide valley, where the torchlights encircle a
fenced, walled encampment, a single ramshackle

00:35:47.262 --> 00:35:54.438
watchtower marks the center of the interior of
this large, sharpened pike-like wall. The back

00:35:54.438 --> 00:35:58.404
half of the wall is buttressed against the
mountain base, across the valley from you,

00:35:58.404 --> 00:36:04.164
vanishing into a large cavern. So it's not a full
encirclement. You see the wall encircles around

00:36:04.164 --> 00:36:08.136
the base of the mountain and each side ends at the
mountain. There's an actual natural cavern that

00:36:08.136 --> 00:36:12.045
the base of it hides in shadow.

00:36:12.045 --> 00:36:14.914
LAURA: That's a nice camp. They've got a real nice
camp.

00:36:14.914 --> 00:36:17.225
TRAVIS: Location, location, location.

00:36:17.225 --> 00:36:20.013
SAM: But do they have grog?

00:36:20.013 --> 00:36:21.655
TRAVIS: I hope.

00:36:21.655 --> 00:36:32.816
MATT: You had the 22? You also hear, faintly, off
in the distance, this (snuffling and growling).

00:36:32.816 --> 00:36:38.727
You've heard this sound before. It's kept you up
at night, whenever the caragors in their cages

00:36:38.727 --> 00:36:44.375
were particularly rambunctious. It sounds like a
caragor. As soon as you hear it, you also hear a

00:36:44.375 --> 00:36:50.096
(alert yelp). A second one, not far from it, goes
(snuffling).

00:36:50.096 --> 00:36:53.446
LAURA: There's caragors!

00:36:53.446 --> 00:36:58.112
MATT: Yeah, but like, near you. Maybe 40 feet from
you, at the moment.

00:36:58.112 --> 00:36:59.594
TRAVIS: Are there trees around us?

00:36:59.594 --> 00:37:01.796
MATT: No trees. You're in Mordor right now.

00:37:01.796 --> 00:37:06.442
TRAVIS: Yep, just thought I'd ask. You know, some
ashen trees?

00:37:06.442 --> 00:37:13.805
MATT: I mean, there are jagged rocks. Part of the
terrain itself is a series of broken shale and

00:37:13.805 --> 00:37:17.877
large rock faces that jut out of the ground from
seismic activity.

00:37:17.877 --> 00:37:20.883
LAURA: Should we hide behind rocks? It's
caragors.

00:37:20.883 --> 00:37:22.558
TRAVIS: You hear caragors?

00:37:22.558 --> 00:37:25.456
LAURA: Yeah, like real big-sounding ones.

00:37:25.456 --> 00:37:27.353
TRAVIS: Prepare to fight! And I hide.

00:37:27.353 --> 00:37:28.974
MATT: Okay, make a stealth check.

00:37:28.974 --> 00:37:32.106
SAM: Hide? No, we should sneak past them!

00:37:32.106 --> 00:37:36.066
TRAVIS: That's true, we should. 16.

00:37:36.066 --> 00:37:41.993
MATT: Okay. So you watch as Skak disappears behind
a rock. What are you guys doing?

00:37:41.993 --> 00:37:44.847
LAURA: I also try to duck behind a rock.

00:37:44.847 --> 00:37:46.399
SAM: Are we going to sit here?

00:37:46.399 --> 00:37:51.388
LAURA: I'm going to duck behind a rock and wait
for one to show its face around a rock, and then

00:37:51.388 --> 00:37:53.407
I'm going to hit it with my maul.

00:37:53.407 --> 00:37:55.367
MATT: Okay, make a stealth check with
disadvantage.

00:37:55.367 --> 00:37:57.792
SAM: Why don't we try to go past them?!

00:37:57.792 --> 00:38:01.595
LAURA: Seven.

00:38:01.595 --> 00:38:13.021
MATT: Okay. You watch as Arby nods, follows suit,
right behind where Skak is. The rock's almost the

00:38:13.021 --> 00:38:18.980
size of Arby, so you see this outline of Arby
clutching this rock and trying to act quiet as the

00:38:18.980 --> 00:38:21.648
armor (clanking).

00:38:21.648 --> 00:38:25.788
TRAVIS: Look and see if we can make it past them!
You, stick your head out.

00:38:25.788 --> 00:38:32.449
SAM: All right, I will stealthily see if I can see
any caragors. Move out, look around.

00:38:32.449 --> 00:38:35.088
MATT: Make a stealth check.

00:38:35.088 --> 00:38:39.186
SAM: Ooh! 25!

00:38:39.186 --> 00:38:43.138
LAURA: Sneaky sneaky!

00:38:43.138 --> 00:38:49.047
MATT: As you climb a little bit of the rock face
on one side of this pathway that's carved into the

00:38:49.047 --> 00:38:56.949
mountain base here, you glance up. You can see the
faint bit of moonlight that breaks through one of

00:38:56.949 --> 00:39:01.736
the nearby clouds. You can see the outer rim of
two fully-grown caragors that are currently

00:39:01.736 --> 00:39:07.698
walking, maybe 15 feet from each other, a dual
hunting scenario. They're both like (sniffing and

00:39:07.698 --> 00:39:13.798
grunting) on the ground, and they're smelling for
any sort of possible prey that might be in the

00:39:13.798 --> 00:39:15.249
vicinity.

00:39:15.249 --> 00:39:19.108
SAM: Hi! We need to distract them somehow. Does
anyone have any meat on them?

00:39:19.108 --> 00:39:22.158
LAURA: No, but I have a bell!

00:39:22.158 --> 00:39:24.058
SAM: A bell?

00:39:24.058 --> 00:39:25.199
LAURA: Yeah.

00:39:25.199 --> 00:39:26.589
SAM: That would distract?

00:39:26.589 --> 00:39:29.036
LAURA: Well, it's a bell! It makes noise.

00:39:29.036 --> 00:39:31.409
MATT: (bell clanging) The bell is now ringing in
her hand.

00:39:31.409 --> 00:39:34.789
SAM: Throw the bell!

00:39:34.789 --> 00:39:37.941
LAURA: I throw the bell as far away as I can!

00:39:37.941 --> 00:39:42.730
MATT: The caragors at this point (snarling). They
both go jumping and leaping in toward where the

00:39:42.730 --> 00:39:44.169
source of the bell sound was.

00:39:44.169 --> 00:39:45.478
LAURA: I throw the bell!

00:39:45.478 --> 00:39:46.763
MATT: Make a strength check.

00:39:46.763 --> 00:39:48.932
TRAVIS: Oh my god. Please throw it a mile.

00:39:48.932 --> 00:39:51.690
LAURA: 18!

00:39:51.690 --> 00:39:55.929
MATT: The bell arcs behind where you guys were.

00:39:55.929 --> 00:39:57.923
LAURA: Oh wait, no, 15. Because it's not a saving
throw.

00:39:57.923 --> 00:40:03.742
MATT: Right. It arcs off behind you and you watch
as one large caragor, nearly 15 feet from end to

00:40:03.742 --> 00:40:08.896
end, leaps from the top of the cliff, down into
the ravine behind you, the rock ravine where you

00:40:08.896 --> 00:40:13.838
were, and pounces on right where the bell landed.
You hear it ping (crushing). With an impact, you

00:40:13.838 --> 00:40:19.366
see rocks get thrown, as it scrapes across the
ground and it tears where the sound source was, it

00:40:19.366 --> 00:40:23.569
sits there, tearing at it. The other one comes
right up to the edge to inspect inside. Right over

00:40:23.569 --> 00:40:28.295
where you are, it hasn't quite noticed you right
now as you guys are all standing still, the bell

00:40:28.295 --> 00:40:30.986
is quickly being noticed to not be anything
fleshy.

00:40:30.986 --> 00:40:33.024
LAURA: I look up. Is it like right above the
head?

00:40:33.024 --> 00:40:35.570
MATT: It's about, maybe, five feet above you right
now.

00:40:35.570 --> 00:40:39.152
LAURA: So I could take my maul and go like
&lt;i&gt;this!&lt;/i&gt;

00:40:39.152 --> 00:40:40.700
MATT: Sure.

00:40:40.700 --> 00:40:44.000
TRAVIS: I could use Mage Hand to create a better
distraction.

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:45.799
LAURA: Too late.

00:40:45.799 --> 00:40:47.533
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:40:47.533 --> 00:40:53.212
MATT: Go ahead and roll an attack. You have
advantage on this strike since it's unaware of

00:40:53.212 --> 00:40:55.162
your position.

00:40:55.162 --> 00:40:56.229
LAURA: 26.

00:40:56.229 --> 00:40:57.558
MATT: 26 hits, yeah.

00:40:57.558 --> 00:41:04.019
LAURA: (laughing) Aw. 11.

00:41:04.019 --> 00:41:09.429
MATT: 11 points of damage, nice. So, as the one
that-- its snout kind of creeped over the edge,

00:41:09.429 --> 00:41:15.893
you can see its teeth are this thick underbite of
its jaw pulling open as it's trying to take in

00:41:15.893 --> 00:41:20.630
the air both through its nose and its mouth.
(snarling) At which point, out of the darkness,

00:41:20.630 --> 00:41:28.775
this giant maul head slams right into its snout
and it backs up briefly, and as that happens and

00:41:28.775 --> 00:41:33.668
you pull the maul back, it glances down with this
look of absolute hatred and death in its eyes.

00:41:33.668 --> 00:41:36.440
(roars)

00:41:36.440 --> 00:41:37.740
LAURA: I think it saw us.

00:41:37.740 --> 00:41:41.139
MATT: You do get a second attack because you did
take the action on this one. And at this point,

00:41:41.139 --> 00:41:45.200
the other one spins around from where the bell
was, hearing the pained sound of its ally.

00:41:45.200 --> 00:41:46.393
LAURA: 17?

00:41:46.393 --> 00:41:47.470
MATT: 17 hits.

00:41:47.470 --> 00:41:53.780
LAURA: Yes! 12.

00:41:53.780 --> 00:41:59.830
MATT: 12 points of damage, all righty. So, as it's
gearing up over the side, you take the maul and

00:41:59.830 --> 00:42:02.866
slam it again. This time it moves its head to the
side and it hits the side of its neck. It's a

00:42:02.866 --> 00:42:07.013
heavy hit, and it takes the brunt of it, but it's
&lt;i&gt;so&lt;/i&gt; big. I mean, you're pretty big as an

00:42:07.013 --> 00:42:10.985
olog-hai. It's probably at least two or more times
the mass of your body.

00:42:10.985 --> 00:42:13.048
LAURA: Oh, it's so much bigger than I thought it
was.

00:42:13.048 --> 00:42:15.128
TRAVIS: I think you were thinking it was like a
dog.

00:42:15.128 --> 00:42:20.560
SAM: Oh, because you didn't play an orc in the
game, so you don't know that these things are

00:42:20.560 --> 00:42:22.682
really powerful.

00:42:22.682 --> 00:42:23.806
LAURA: No!

00:42:23.806 --> 00:42:25.117
TRAVIS: Really terrible.

00:42:25.117 --> 00:42:27.708
DARIN: But they can be defeated by a bell.

00:42:27.708 --> 00:42:29.818
TRAVIS: It's like a giant liger.

00:42:29.818 --> 00:42:33.398
MATT: And on that note, I would like everybody to
roll initiative, please, as these two caragor are

00:42:33.398 --> 00:42:36.477
now bearing down on you in this ravine. Oh, okay.

00:42:36.477 --> 00:42:39.542
LAURA: We got more of them than they have. It's
okay.

00:42:39.542 --> 00:42:41.247
DARIN: 17.

00:42:41.247 --> 00:42:42.605
MATT: Oh, nice.

00:42:42.605 --> 00:42:44.695
SAM: I think we should try to run.

00:42:44.695 --> 00:42:49.249
MATT: (laughs) Yeah, these guys don't seem very
fast.

00:42:49.249 --> 00:42:50.736
SAM: Six.

00:42:50.736 --> 00:42:51.848
LAURA: Oh no.

00:42:51.848 --> 00:42:53.437
TRAVIS: Yeah, only four-legged.

00:42:53.437 --> 00:42:54.736
LAURA: Nine.

00:42:54.736 --> 00:42:58.645
TRAVIS: Greyhounds of death. 15.

00:42:58.645 --> 00:43:05.017
MATT: All right, Mozuu, you're up first. There's
the one that's up behind you on the path, maybe

00:43:05.017 --> 00:43:08.780
about 15, 20 feet from you, and there's the one
that's right above the edge right now that she

00:43:08.780 --> 00:43:10.424
slammed twice in the face. What are you going to
do?

00:43:10.424 --> 00:43:11.797
DARIN: Thunderous Smite.

00:43:11.797 --> 00:43:14.876
MATT: All right, so you pull forth your war pick,
and you're going to go ahead and strike which one?

00:43:14.876 --> 00:43:17.863
DARIN: The one that was closest to Arby.

00:43:17.863 --> 00:43:18.978
MATT: Okay.

00:43:18.978 --> 00:43:20.607
DARIN: Or I should go for the other one?

00:43:20.607 --> 00:43:23.615
MATT: It's a little high for you right now.
Because of her size, she can barely reach it.

00:43:23.615 --> 00:43:27.810
You'd have to try and make your way up either
Arby, or climb part of the cliff side. Up to you.

00:43:27.810 --> 00:43:30.740
DARIN: Do you mind if I climb you?

00:43:30.740 --> 00:43:31.959
LAURA: Not a bit.

00:43:31.959 --> 00:43:33.140
DARIN: I'm going to climb.

00:43:33.140 --> 00:43:34.410
MATT: Make an athletics check.

00:43:34.410 --> 00:43:35.820
DARIN: Okay.

00:43:35.820 --> 00:43:38.896
SAM: That's either a one or a 20.

00:43:38.896 --> 00:43:40.631
DARIN: I don't know what that is.

00:43:40.631 --> 00:43:42.052
SAM: It's a 20!

00:43:42.052 --> 00:43:43.521
DARIN: Oh, it's a 20!

00:43:43.521 --> 00:43:52.371
MATT: Oh, snap, okay. So, using Arby's body as a
ramp, you begin to leap up from shoulder to back

00:43:52.371 --> 00:43:56.690
to shoulder, the top of her head, and jump in the
air, warpick in the sky as you scream to bring it

00:43:56.690 --> 00:43:59.067
bearing down on the first caragor before you.

00:43:59.067 --> 00:44:02.650
DARIN: (yelling) I speak for Sauron!

00:44:02.650 --> 00:44:05.982
MATT: (laughs) All righty, so, make an attack roll
against it.

00:44:05.982 --> 00:44:09.980
DARIN: 16.

00:44:09.980 --> 00:44:12.841
MATT: 16 hits! Go ahead and roll for this.

00:44:12.841 --> 00:44:15.941
DARIN: I think it's a 1d8 plus three.

00:44:15.941 --> 00:44:19.411
MATT: So yes, 1d8 plus three, and then you add an
additional 2d6 thunder damage to the target.

00:44:19.411 --> 00:44:29.128
DARIN: That's eight, and the six, that is three,
and that is a one. 12.

00:44:29.128 --> 00:44:30.361
MATT: 12 points of damage?

00:44:30.361 --> 00:44:31.440
DARIN: Yeah.

00:44:31.440 --> 00:44:35.701
MATT: All right, so. As you slam the war pick
right into the front of its snout, it jams into

00:44:35.701 --> 00:44:42.971
one nostril and tears through across the side of
its face, releasing this gout of dark purplish-red

00:44:42.971 --> 00:44:49.303
blood, and as the impact hits, there's a burst of
energy. The sheer force of your anger as you

00:44:49.303 --> 00:44:58.041
scream in its face scares it back, and it blows
about ten feet behind you and is knocked prone. It

00:44:58.041 --> 00:45:02.081
rolled a natural four plus four, that's eight. And
I believe your spell DC is 11, right?

00:45:02.081 --> 00:45:04.503
DARIN: Yes it is. Oh yeah!

00:45:04.503 --> 00:45:08.093
MATT: This caragor now gets thrown back ten feet
and is knocked prone on the ground on its side.

00:45:08.093 --> 00:45:13.844
It's trying to snap around and get its feet any
sort of purchase to get back up on to the ground,

00:45:13.844 --> 00:45:16.089
but currently it's open.

00:45:16.089 --> 00:45:18.893
DARIN: The Forcs are a powerful team.

00:45:18.893 --> 00:45:21.278
TRAVIS: We don't forc around.

00:45:21.278 --> 00:45:25.180
MATT: That ends your turn. Okay, so, Skak, you're
up.

00:45:25.180 --> 00:45:28.885
TRAVIS: Skak. Because it's laying prone, I
probably can't see it from below, right?

00:45:28.885 --> 00:45:30.263
MATT: No, you'd have get up.

00:45:30.263 --> 00:45:36.528
TRAVIS: I'll aim to the other one that turned at
the sound of pain, and I will use my crossbow to

00:45:36.528 --> 00:45:37.693
shoot at it.

00:45:37.693 --> 00:45:39.948
MATT: All right, go for it. It just turned around.
(growls)

00:45:39.948 --> 00:45:43.043
TRAVIS: That's terrible. 12.

00:45:43.043 --> 00:45:51.861
MATT: 12. Okay. That does not hit. You turn around
and you fire and it--

00:45:51.861 --> 00:45:55.374
TRAVIS: (whimpers) Bonus action! Hide!

00:45:55.374 --> 00:45:59.974
MATT: I'll let you move around the rock where you
are and try and hide.

00:45:59.974 --> 00:46:03.814
TRAVIS: Okay, fair enough. 18. On stealth.

00:46:03.814 --> 00:46:08.374
MATT: Okay. Good to know. All right. That ends
your turn, it's now their turn. So the one that

00:46:08.374 --> 00:46:13.075
was knocked prone gets up off the ground. Ten feet
away, it still has enough movement as you're

00:46:13.075 --> 00:46:18.915
standing now on the shoulders of Arby. It's going
to go ahead and-- Let's see.

00:46:18.915 --> 00:46:25.614
DARIN: And we put on a big coat and pretend we're
one person. And we sneak into a movie theatre.

00:46:25.614 --> 00:46:33.893
MATT: It takes a five-foot step back and goes into
a 15-foot leap right towards you. It's a deadly

00:46:33.893 --> 00:46:36.714
leap. (snarls) It lunges towards you.

00:46:36.714 --> 00:46:40.674
DARIN: Mm-hmm. This was a wonderful game. Thank you
for letting me play.

00:46:40.674 --> 00:46:46.495
MATT: Yeah, I need both Mozuu and Arby to make
strength or dexterity saving throw, your choice.

00:46:46.495 --> 00:46:48.389
TRAVIS: Get its attention, you can do it.

00:46:48.389 --> 00:46:50.412
DARIN: That's a 13.

00:46:50.412 --> 00:46:51.633
LAURA: 25.

00:46:51.633 --> 00:46:59.897
MATT: You succeed, you do not. All right, so. Here
we go.

00:46:59.897 --> 00:47:04.874
TRAVIS: All the dice come out. Just all the dice.

00:47:04.874 --> 00:47:14.255
MATT: 14 points of bludgeoning and slashing damage
to you, Mozuu, and you are knocked prone as it

00:47:14.255 --> 00:47:19.385
lands on top of you, knocking you off of Arby's
shoulders. You are now on the ground with it on

00:47:19.385 --> 00:47:23.134
top of you going (snarls). And it's tearing and
biting at you as you are currently pinned to the floor.

00:47:23.134 --> 00:47:26.717
DARIN: He's trying to rip out my throat? Sure is
poetic.

00:47:26.717 --> 00:47:32.169
MATT: Turnabout's fair play. You take seven points
of damage, Arby, and you are not knocked prone or

00:47:32.169 --> 00:47:37.266
thrown off, you manage to keep your weight there.
However, it's partially standing on you now, its

00:47:37.266 --> 00:47:41.344
hind legs are up on your back and it's using you
to hold itself as it's currently putting all of

00:47:41.344 --> 00:47:46.674
its weight on Mozuu. The other one that was shot
at by Skak is going to go ahead and rush forward

00:47:46.674 --> 00:47:54.004
and it's going to go ahead and make a deadly leap
as well. Let's see, all that going on with that

00:47:54.004 --> 00:48:01.146
space it's going to have to go after Eden. I need
you to go ahead and make a strength or dexterity

00:48:01.146 --> 00:48:02.745
saving throw, your choice.

00:48:02.745 --> 00:48:05.216
SAM: I'll choose dexterity, and that's a 21.

00:48:05.216 --> 00:48:14.950
MATT: 21, all right. Okay, you take six points of
bludgeoning and slashing damage together, and you

00:48:14.950 --> 00:48:18.940
are not knocked prone. It doesn't pin you in the
space. You just manage to pull out of the way, but

00:48:18.940 --> 00:48:24.431
it's right up in your face now and your back's
against the rock that he's hiding behind. There's

00:48:24.431 --> 00:48:28.413
your friends and the other caragor right behind
you over your shoulders, and this one is right in

00:48:28.413 --> 00:48:32.524
front of you right now, slashing and snarling at
you. That's going to end their turn. Arby, you're up.

00:48:32.524 --> 00:48:36.508
LAURA: I'm going to spin around and try to hit the
one that's standing on me.

00:48:36.508 --> 00:48:38.257
MATT: Okay, that's the one you've hit before, so
go for it.

00:48:38.257 --> 00:48:41.885
LAURA: Yeah. Ooh, 26.

00:48:41.885 --> 00:48:43.281
MATT: 26 hits!

00:48:43.281 --> 00:48:52.224
LAURA: Aw. Dang. Plus seven plus five is 12.

00:48:52.224 --> 00:48:57.762
MATT: All righty, so that first hit slams into its
side. You hit it again, you hear the crunch. One

00:48:57.762 --> 00:49:00.698
shoulder blade seems to almost buckle a little
bit. It's looking pretty hurt but it's still

00:49:00.698 --> 00:49:01.655
standing there.

00:49:01.655 --> 00:49:05.030
LAURA: I'm going to try to hit it again. That's a
19.

00:49:05.030 --> 00:49:06.282
MATT: That hits.

00:49:06.282 --> 00:49:11.561
LAURA: 14.

00:49:11.561 --> 00:49:19.314
MATT: 14, all righty. And with that, you slam up
your maul a second time. It actually catches it

00:49:19.314 --> 00:49:25.091
right underneath the jaw and forces its head to
snap up so fast that its spine seems to break into

00:49:25.091 --> 00:49:29.756
place, and with a (whines) it falls limp, the
entirety of its weight sliding off of your

00:49:29.756 --> 00:49:33.560
shoulders and onto Mozuu, who is now prone and
pinned underneath it.

00:49:33.560 --> 00:49:38.131
DARIN: I've gotten the most damage of this entire
game.

00:49:38.131 --> 00:49:41.331
LAURA: Eden! Do you want me to try to hit that one
too?

00:49:41.331 --> 00:49:43.334
SAM: Yes!

00:49:43.334 --> 00:49:46.890
LAURA: I'm going to action surge and try to run up
to the other one and attack it too.

00:49:46.890 --> 00:49:47.958
TRAVIS: Action surge.

00:49:47.958 --> 00:49:50.852
MATT: Okay. So. Taking a little bit there, shoving
it off to the side, you rush up to the one that's

00:49:50.852 --> 00:49:52.302
right in the face of Eden. It's a quick jaunt.

00:49:52.302 --> 00:49:54.126
LAURA: That's a 24.

00:49:54.126 --> 00:49:55.060
MATT: That hits!

00:49:55.060 --> 00:49:56.791
SAM: You're so powerful.

00:49:56.791 --> 00:49:59.371
TRAVIS: Wow.

00:49:59.371 --> 00:50:00.592
LAURA: Are you kidding me?!

00:50:00.592 --> 00:50:02.151
TRAVIS: Double ones both times!

00:50:02.151 --> 00:50:03.134
MATT: What?!

00:50:03.134 --> 00:50:05.701
LAURA: Sorry, that's seven points of damage.

00:50:05.701 --> 00:50:09.774
MATT: All right, seven points of damage. You rush
up and swing at it. This time, it brings its head

00:50:09.774 --> 00:50:13.302
back and manages to deflect some of the blow with
the side of its face; not quite doing as much

00:50:13.302 --> 00:50:14.867
damage as you'd like.

00:50:14.867 --> 00:50:16.770
LAURA: Ooh, natural 20 on the next hit!

00:50:16.770 --> 00:50:18.882
MATT: Make up for that! There you go!

00:50:18.882 --> 00:50:23.283
LAURA: 25 points of damage.

00:50:23.283 --> 00:50:27.952
MATT: 25 points of damage! So, while it deflects
the first blow, as it turns its head back to

00:50:27.952 --> 00:50:34.381
strike at you, you put your foot up and hold it
right in its jaw to keep it from getting away. You

00:50:34.381 --> 00:50:39.302
use that to aim it up and whack right up the side
of its temple. It rings its bell and you watch as

00:50:39.302 --> 00:50:44.551
it pulls away, the slobber and blood dripping from
its jaws, shaking its head back and forth from the

00:50:44.551 --> 00:50:46.893
pain you just inflicted. I believe that ends your
turn.

00:50:46.893 --> 00:50:47.931
LAURA: Yes, it does.

00:50:47.931 --> 00:50:49.361
MATT: End of Arby's turn brings it to you, Eden.

00:50:49.361 --> 00:50:57.172
SAM: (growling) I will attack relentlessly! 23 to
hit.

00:50:57.172 --> 00:50:58.458
MATT: 23 hits!

00:50:58.458 --> 00:51:02.488
SAM: That is five points of damage.

00:51:02.488 --> 00:51:04.771
TRAVIS: Relentless damage!

00:51:04.771 --> 00:51:09.243
SAM: I will use my Flurry of Blows.

00:51:09.243 --> 00:51:12.701
MATT: You get two attacks and then you can use
your Flurry.

00:51:12.701 --> 00:51:19.318
SAM: Got it. So, second attack doesn't hit. It's
12. So I can't use my Flurry of Blows?

00:51:19.318 --> 00:51:20.171
MATT: You can!

00:51:20.171 --> 00:51:21.206
SAM: Okay! Flurry of Blows!

00:51:21.206 --> 00:51:22.407
MATT: So you get two more attacks.

00:51:22.407 --> 00:51:25.766
SAM: That's worse. And 15.

00:51:25.766 --> 00:51:26.992
MATT: 15 just barely hits.

00:51:26.992 --> 00:51:38.546
SAM: Eight! Plus four is 12 points of damage. Plus
I will choose a condition for it. Strength saving

00:51:38.546 --> 00:51:46.209
throw? If it fails, no, it probably is strong.
It's probably dextrous, too. I'm going to choose

00:51:46.209 --> 00:51:49.292
that it can't take reactions until the end of my
next turn.

00:51:49.292 --> 00:51:53.663
MATT: So it can't take attacks of opportunity.
There you go. Perfect. That ends your turn, Eden.

00:51:53.663 --> 00:51:58.722
Mozuu, you're up. Currently prone and pinned under
the dead body of a caragor.

00:51:58.722 --> 00:52:00.475
DARIN: May I call for help?

00:52:00.475 --> 00:52:01.562
MATT: Yes, you may.

00:52:01.562 --> 00:52:08.129
DARIN: I would like to do that. You thought I was
going to say something else, but I would like to

00:52:08.129 --> 00:52:14.066
call: Hello? Might I have a bit of aid, please?

00:52:14.066 --> 00:52:18.154
MATT: Are you going to attempt to pull your way
out, or are you just waiting for someone to help you?

00:52:18.154 --> 00:52:19.533
DARIN: I'm waiting for someone to help me.

00:52:19.533 --> 00:52:22.263
MATT: You're holding your action for someone to
aid.

00:52:22.263 --> 00:52:23.754
DARIN: I've been beaten up a lot.

00:52:23.754 --> 00:52:26.031
TRAVIS: Do we see him under this giant caragor?

00:52:26.031 --> 00:52:31.223
MATT: You hear and see, out of the corner of your
eye. You especially see it because you're right

00:52:31.223 --> 00:52:34.568
behind the rock and you see his head and shoulders
are right there like, "Help!"

00:52:34.568 --> 00:52:41.308
DARIN: Excellent. The person who isn't the
strongest! This'll be fun!

00:52:41.308 --> 00:52:43.613
TRAVIS: I'm on my way!

00:52:43.613 --> 00:52:50.769
MATT: Holding your action for someone to help you.
That brings us to Skak's turn.

00:52:50.769 --> 00:53:02.327
TRAVIS: (panicked noises) Can I not help him at
all? I pop back up out of hiding. Can I take aim

00:53:02.327 --> 00:53:08.364
with the crossbow again? As a bonus, can I smash a
poison vial on one of my arrows to make it a

00:53:08.364 --> 00:53:09.793
poisoned arrow?

00:53:09.793 --> 00:53:14.151
MATT: It's an action to poison a weapon. It's more
of a preparation thing.

00:53:14.151 --> 00:53:20.102
TRAVIS: I'll keep that in mind. Crossbow! Natural
20!

00:53:20.102 --> 00:53:25.570
MATT: Oh shit! Roll your dice and then add the
modifiers after you double it.

00:53:25.570 --> 00:53:27.530
TRAVIS: Six.

00:53:27.530 --> 00:53:29.033
LAURA: Plus your sneak attack.

00:53:29.033 --> 00:53:31.368
TRAVIS: Is it sneak attack? Is he within melee of
the other ones?

00:53:31.368 --> 00:53:33.100
MATT: Yeah, they've both been bashing it.

00:53:33.100 --> 00:53:46.182
TRAVIS: Excellent. Oh god. 16. 24.

00:53:46.182 --> 00:53:50.443
LAURA: You're supposed to double your dice, all of
your dice.

00:53:50.443 --> 00:53:54.244
TRAVIS: 26. That one's supposed to be doubled too,
right?

00:53:54.244 --> 00:53:55.070
LAURA: Yep.

00:53:55.070 --> 00:53:56.204
TRAVIS: Okay. 26.

00:53:56.204 --> 00:54:07.095
MATT: 26 points of damage. All right. Yeah. As you
peek out of hiding, you see it snapping and

00:54:07.095 --> 00:54:16.695
snarling at both of your friends over on the side.
You take a moment and slow your breathing. (heartbeats)

00:54:16.726 --> 00:54:21.984
And release the crossbow bolt. You watch
behind as it streaks forward between your friends.

00:54:21.984 --> 00:54:27.851
The caragor turns, opening its jaw to snap over
Arby and it goes right in the back of the throat,

00:54:27.851 --> 00:54:36.764
up into the brain and it collapses to the ground,
no longer moving.

00:54:36.764 --> 00:54:39.563
TRAVIS: Oh, are you okay, Mozuu?

00:54:39.563 --> 00:54:41.783
DARIN: Yes.

00:54:41.783 --> 00:54:43.773
LAURA and SAM: Mozuu?

00:54:43.773 --> 00:54:46.851
DARIN: I am a talking caragor!

00:54:46.851 --> 00:54:49.994
LAURA: I walk over and try to push the caragor.

00:54:49.994 --> 00:54:57.686
MATT: Since you're not in immediate danger, it
takes you a minute or so. You all manage to push

00:54:57.686 --> 00:55:03.323
this giant caragor corpse off of Mozuu's body.
You're sore, you're crushed, you're sweaty and

00:55:03.323 --> 00:55:05.445
covered in blood, but you're now standing.

00:55:05.445 --> 00:55:08.223
LAURA: See! That wasn't so bad!

00:55:08.223 --> 00:55:11.014
SAM: Is our prisoner still around, or did he run
away?

00:55:11.014 --> 00:55:12.954
MATT: Make a perception check.

00:55:12.954 --> 00:55:14.858
LAURA: Oh, I forgot we even had him!

00:55:14.858 --> 00:55:17.385
SAM: Oh, perception! 21!

00:55:17.385 --> 00:55:22.494
MATT: 21. He is quite a ways down the walkway
sprinting away.

00:55:22.494 --> 00:55:23.867
SAM: I could catch him!

00:55:23.867 --> 00:55:24.947
TRAVIS: Can you?

00:55:24.947 --> 00:55:25.872
SAM: I can!

00:55:25.872 --> 00:55:27.044
LAURA: Let's take off after him.

00:55:27.044 --> 00:55:30.893
SAM: I'm going to sprint after him using Step of
the Wind.

00:55:30.893 --> 00:55:37.257
MATT: You're going to use another ki point. With
your speed and double dash, as he's sprinting.

00:55:37.257 --> 00:55:44.305
(heavy panting) About a minute later or so, you
catch up right behind him and he's within grasp of

00:55:44.305 --> 00:55:48.504
you. He hasn't noticed you, he's just eyes on the
prize right towards the fortress.

00:55:48.504 --> 00:55:51.444
SAM: I grab the top of his skull.

00:55:51.444 --> 00:55:54.791
MATT: Make an athletics check to grapple him.

00:55:54.791 --> 00:55:57.391
SAM: Athletics? 17.

00:55:57.391 --> 00:56:03.377
MATT: 17. You grab him by the back of the head and
he gets yanked out from under his feet and slams

00:56:03.377 --> 00:56:06.877
into the ground. You're still clutching him. You
pick him up. He's dangling now from your giant

00:56:06.877 --> 00:56:08.495
olog mitts.

00:56:08.495 --> 00:56:10.738
SAM: Can't run from the Forcs!

00:56:10.738 --> 00:56:16.886
MATT: "I was running from the caragors!
Self-preservation, mate!"

00:56:16.886 --> 00:56:21.776
SAM: That makes sense. All right, we'll wait here
for the others and then we follow this plan.

00:56:21.776 --> 00:56:22.656
MATT: "Yes!"

00:56:22.656 --> 00:56:23.696
SAM: You're on our side.

00:56:23.696 --> 00:56:24.618
MATT: "Of course!"

00:56:24.618 --> 00:56:25.796
SAM: I trust you implicitly.

00:56:25.796 --> 00:56:27.289
MATT: "Don't worry!"

00:56:27.289 --> 00:56:30.071
SAM: I don't worry about anything.

00:56:30.071 --> 00:56:33.026
TRAVIS: Can we see if he's killing him or having a
chat?

00:56:33.026 --> 00:56:37.256
MATT: Make a perception check.

00:56:37.256 --> 00:56:41.377
TRAVIS: Nope! Two!

00:56:41.377 --> 00:56:45.050
MATT: You see him grabbing him by the head and
pulling him in and you see a bit of a struggle.

00:56:45.050 --> 00:56:46.997
LAURA: You should probably shoot him.

00:56:46.997 --> 00:56:47.946
TRAVIS: He's killing him.

00:56:47.946 --> 00:56:48.801
LAURA: Yeah.

00:56:48.801 --> 00:56:49.906
TRAVIS: I nock an arrow.

00:56:49.906 --> 00:56:52.447
MATT: Roll an attack.

00:56:52.447 --> 00:56:56.737
TRAVIS: Oh shit. 25.

00:56:56.737 --> 00:56:58.882
MATT: Roll damage with sneak attack.

00:56:58.882 --> 00:57:02.762
(laughter)

00:57:02.762 --> 00:57:04.356
LAURA: We're so terrible!

00:57:04.356 --> 00:57:10.955
TRAVIS: That's terrible! Eight. Nine. 13.

00:57:10.955 --> 00:57:13.292
MATT: As you're holding him.

00:57:13.292 --> 00:57:18.726
SAM: I trust you implicitly. We are in this
together 100%.

00:57:18.726 --> 00:57:22.763
MATT: "Don't worry, we've got this! All right, we're
going to make our way inside."

00:57:22.763 --> 00:57:27.757
SAM: Friends. Oh no!

00:57:27.757 --> 00:57:30.669
TRAVIS: Heal him!

00:57:30.669 --> 00:57:39.620
SAM: I can! I will use my medical kit to stabilize
him! I pull out the arrow! No, don't do this to

00:57:39.620 --> 00:57:50.489
me! Come on, fight! You can come back! I spit into
the wound, I close it with my hand.

00:57:50.489 --> 00:57:55.389
MATT: I'm going to ask you right now to make an
initiative roll to see how fast you are at healing

00:57:55.389 --> 00:57:58.281
him versus how fast he's bleeding out from the
wound.

00:57:58.281 --> 00:57:59.535
SAM: Nine.

00:57:59.535 --> 00:58:13.607
MATT: You finish applying the bandages, you've
pulled out the bolt, and you have the body there.

00:58:13.607 --> 00:58:17.887
(cough) He rolled a three.

00:58:17.887 --> 00:58:19.987
SAM: Bock! Bock-Bock! What's his name?

00:58:19.987 --> 00:58:20.933
LAURA: Borg-Borg!

00:58:20.933 --> 00:58:21.881
SAM: Borg-Borg?

00:58:21.881 --> 00:58:23.117
MATT: "Just Borg."

00:58:23.117 --> 00:58:34.178
SAM: Borg, I thought I had lost you. I don't know
what happened. All I can say is: I'm sorry and it

00:58:34.178 --> 00:58:36.048
will never happen again.

00:58:36.048 --> 00:58:44.770
MATT: You guys approach as Eden is cradling this
freshly bandaged goblin.

00:58:44.770 --> 00:58:45.948
LAURA: Did we kill him?

00:58:45.948 --> 00:58:47.288
TRAVIS: Oh, you fixed him up?

00:58:47.288 --> 00:58:49.647
SAM: Why did you do that?! He's our ticket in!

00:58:49.647 --> 00:58:51.648
LAURA and TRAVIS: Oh!

00:58:51.648 --> 00:58:56.639
SAM: I think you can still trust us, all right?

00:58:56.639 --> 00:58:58.164
MATT: "Okay."

00:58:58.164 --> 00:59:03.567
TRAVIS: Or you can take that as a sign of things
to come if you do it again!

00:59:03.567 --> 00:59:05.601
MATT: Make an intimidation check.

00:59:05.601 --> 00:59:09.948
TRAVIS: Prepare to feel the-- oh, not terrible!
20!

00:59:09.948 --> 00:59:16.460
MATT: He goes, "Right. Point making. I'm good. All
right."

00:59:16.460 --> 00:59:27.110
TRAVIS: Boy, don't you call me point making! All
right. Inside. Wait. Should we make him look a

00:59:27.110 --> 00:59:29.468
little better? You almost killed him.

00:59:29.468 --> 00:59:32.950
LAURA: Does anybody have any lipstick? And some
rouge?

00:59:32.950 --> 00:59:34.920
TRAVIS: What?

00:59:34.920 --> 00:59:37.521
LAURA: I thought we were going to make him
pretty.

00:59:37.521 --> 00:59:38.917
SAM: I have a robe.

00:59:38.917 --> 00:59:44.559
DARIN: I have oil. In certain cases, I'm just
saying.

00:59:44.559 --> 00:59:46.071
LAURA: I have some bagpipes.

00:59:46.071 --> 00:59:47.196
TRAVIS: I have a crowbar.

00:59:47.196 --> 00:59:48.342
SAM: You have a bagpipe?

00:59:48.342 --> 00:59:52.333
LAURA: I like to play music sometimes, that's
all.

00:59:52.333 --> 00:59:56.181
SAM: I think we're good, let's just get on with
it.

00:59:56.181 --> 01:00:04.121
MATT: All right. So as you guys slowly begin to
encroach upon the outer elements of this fortress,

01:00:04.121 --> 01:00:10.860
the points of torchlight burning in these braziers
along the top side of it, you can see guards

01:00:10.860 --> 01:00:16.631
walking back and forth along the edges, shortbows
at the side, nocked and ready in case any sign of

01:00:16.631 --> 01:00:22.961
danger happens. You can see a front-- actually,
for you guys that are closest, go ahead and make a

01:00:22.961 --> 01:00:25.102
perception check.

01:00:25.102 --> 01:00:28.112
TRAVIS: Yeah! 17.

01:00:28.112 --> 01:00:29.442
MATT: All righty.

01:00:29.442 --> 01:00:30.401
SAM: Nothing.

01:00:30.401 --> 01:00:31.441
LAURA: Five.

01:00:31.441 --> 01:00:33.502
DARIN: Nine.

01:00:33.502 --> 01:00:39.071
MATT: Okay. So as you all stare off and it's about
as much as you can make out. You, however, Skak,

01:00:39.071 --> 01:00:43.891
looking ahead, you can see: one, there's a main
entrance. There's two large, eight-foot-wide doors

01:00:43.891 --> 01:00:51.986
that are currently closed on the north side of the
wall. You also see what happens to be a

01:00:51.986 --> 01:00:58.924
muck-covered mud hole that's towards the south
side, where the wall meets the mountain, where you

01:00:58.924 --> 01:01:05.172
can see it's a little swampy and it looks like
some of this thick muck and mud meets up to the

01:01:05.172 --> 01:01:06.916
side of the wall there.

01:01:06.916 --> 01:01:15.325
TRAVIS: So the doors lie ahead but I see off to
the side a little quagmire.

01:01:15.325 --> 01:01:16.332
LAURA: What's that?

01:01:16.332 --> 01:01:20.109
TRAVIS: It's like mucky, muddier earth and
liquid--

01:01:20.109 --> 01:01:21.477
LAURA: Oh, we could take a bath!

01:01:21.477 --> 01:01:26.252
TRAVIS: We could, yes, or we could see if perhaps
there's a way under the wall.

01:01:26.252 --> 01:01:31.063
DARIN: Do you know what that is? Have you been
through there before?

01:01:31.063 --> 01:01:35.133
MATT: "Well, I've seen it, aye."

01:01:35.133 --> 01:01:37.216
DARIN: Have you ever seen anyone go in or out of
there?

01:01:37.216 --> 01:01:39.576
MATT: "Not intentionally. It's the shrak
hole."

01:01:39.613 --> 01:01:41.264
(groaning)

01:01:41.264 --> 01:01:42.698
LAURA: What's that?

01:01:42.698 --> 01:01:51.845
MATT: "I could show you." (coughs) Its wrapping is
all around the face and one eye-- it was already

01:01:51.845 --> 01:01:55.758
swollen from earlier and is now-- he's a
wrecked-looking goblin.

01:01:55.758 --> 01:01:57.356
LAURA: What happened to your neck?

01:01:57.356 --> 01:02:00.005
MATT: "I don't know."

01:02:00.005 --> 01:02:02.728
TRAVIS: So we either go in through the front
door--

01:02:02.728 --> 01:02:04.545
SAM: Or the back door.

01:02:04.545 --> 01:02:13.384
TRAVIS: (laughs) Oh yes, literally! Oh jeez! Oh
gosh.

01:02:13.384 --> 01:02:16.699
SAM: I think we should go through the back door.

01:02:16.699 --> 01:02:19.959
(laughter)

01:02:19.959 --> 01:02:21.678
TRAVIS: (laughs) Okay.

01:02:21.678 --> 01:02:23.484
SAM: Hey, shrak happens.

01:02:23.484 --> 01:02:31.108
TRAVIS: Yeah, it does. Shrak yeah! Okay, do we
send him first? No, because if he gets in, he

01:02:31.108 --> 01:02:34.248
runs away. I'm just saying.

01:02:34.248 --> 01:02:36.224
SAM: Yeah, we'll go first. Right?

01:02:36.224 --> 01:02:37.671
TRAVIS: Which one of us?

01:02:37.671 --> 01:02:43.156
DARIN: Who's the most beaten up? Who's been through
absolute hell?

01:02:43.156 --> 01:02:44.419
SAM: You.

01:02:44.419 --> 01:02:47.583
DARIN: There's two things I know. I'm going
first--

01:02:47.583 --> 01:02:50.191
ALL: And that's it.

01:02:50.191 --> 01:02:53.590
DARIN: I'm going first.

01:02:53.590 --> 01:02:54.937
SAM: Go through that shrak hole!

01:02:54.937 --> 01:02:58.894
MATT: All right. So I want you guys to all make
stealth checks to make your way around that hole

01:02:58.894 --> 01:03:00.336
without being seen.

01:03:00.336 --> 01:03:01.905
SAM: We're stealthing?

01:03:01.905 --> 01:03:05.117
MATT: Yes, and that's disadvantage for you, Arby,
unfortunately. Because you have heavy armor on.

01:03:05.117 --> 01:03:07.646
LAURA: (high-pitched) Oh man! But I rolled so well
on that first one!

01:03:07.646 --> 01:03:08.939
MATT: (high-pitched) Well, roll a second time!

01:03:08.939 --> 01:03:10.275
DARIN: So the roll plus dexterity?

01:03:10.275 --> 01:03:12.195
MATT: No, it's a stealth check.

01:03:12.195 --> 01:03:13.308
DARIN: Oh, five.

01:03:13.308 --> 01:03:14.630
TRAVIS: Five total?

01:03:14.630 --> 01:03:15.532
SAM: Nine.

01:03:15.532 --> 01:03:16.576
DARIN: It was a one.

01:03:16.576 --> 01:03:17.996
TRAVIS: 21.

01:03:17.996 --> 01:03:19.386
LAURA: Ten.

01:03:19.386 --> 01:03:25.617
MATT: Okay! As you guys quietly make your way over
to the shrak hole, you approach the base of the

01:03:25.617 --> 01:03:32.585
gate there and you hear a voice above you go,
"Hey! What are you doing?"

01:03:32.585 --> 01:03:34.088
SAM: Bonk! Say something!

01:03:34.088 --> 01:03:39.916
MATT: You look up and there's three archers that
all have their bows notched on you, going, "What

01:03:39.916 --> 01:03:41.045
"the hell are you--"

01:03:41.045 --> 01:03:42.444
SAM: Brick, say something!

01:03:42.444 --> 01:03:52.392
MATT: "Oh. We're gathering for the alchemist. Getting
some more prime shrak for his boomy balls!

01:03:52.392 --> 01:03:59.086
"Yeah!" He's going to attempt to make a deception--
oh, not bad, actually. Let's see if they-- rolling

01:03:59.086 --> 01:04:07.265
against myself here. "All right. Who are them?"

01:04:07.265 --> 01:04:10.757
LAURA: We're the Forcs!

01:04:10.757 --> 01:04:14.852
MATT: "What's the Forcs?"

01:04:14.852 --> 01:04:17.096
LAURA: It's what you eat with!

01:04:17.096 --> 01:04:19.138
SAM: We work for Ur-Gram!

01:04:19.138 --> 01:04:23.207
MATT: Make a deception check.

01:04:23.207 --> 01:04:26.715
SAM: Oh no. Five.

01:04:26.715 --> 01:04:34.727
MATT: One of them starts whispering to the other
one and the one that he's whispering to nods and

01:04:34.727 --> 01:04:40.723
goes and grabs one of the torches and starts going
over towards one of the unlit braziers. You've

01:04:40.723 --> 01:04:46.656
seen these before; they're used usually as a
beacon, a warning, a signal for any sort of undue--

01:04:46.656 --> 01:04:49.735
SAM: Let's go through the shrak hole right away!
Fast, charging in!

01:04:49.735 --> 01:04:51.243
LAURA: You kill him.

01:04:51.243 --> 01:04:55.345
TRAVIS: The guy walking towards the brazier? Yeah,
but there are three longbows above us and we have

01:04:55.345 --> 01:04:56.504
the low ground.

01:04:56.504 --> 01:04:58.972
SAM: That's why we have to go through the shrak
hole, as fast as we can!

01:04:58.972 --> 01:05:01.377
LAURA: Kill him so he doesn't light it, then we go
into the poop.

01:05:01.377 --> 01:05:07.046
TRAVIS: Okay. I eye the guy walking with the torch
towards the brazier. Does he look like he intends

01:05:07.046 --> 01:05:08.635
to light said brazier?

01:05:08.635 --> 01:05:09.843
MATT: He looks like he intends to light it.

01:05:09.843 --> 01:05:13.999
TRAVIS: I will draw very quickly the crossbow and
try and put one in while he's not looking.

01:05:13.999 --> 01:05:15.544
MATT: Go ahead and roll for an attack.

01:05:15.544 --> 01:05:17.024
TRAVIS: Rolling with sneak attack.

01:05:17.024 --> 01:05:19.353
SAM: How high is the wall, Matt?

01:05:19.353 --> 01:05:20.493
LAURA: Is it a surprise attack?

01:05:20.493 --> 01:05:24.566
MATT: No, it is not a surprise attack. It's
probably about 15 feet high.

01:05:24.566 --> 01:05:26.217
TRAVIS: But is it a sneak attack?

01:05:26.217 --> 01:05:31.294
MATT: You weren't-- oh, you were pretty stealthed,
the rest weren't. So yeah, it is now a sneak

01:05:31.294 --> 01:05:32.304
attack.

01:05:32.304 --> 01:05:33.503
TRAVIS: 16 to hit.

01:05:33.503 --> 01:05:36.273
MATT: 16 to hit. Yeah, that hits! The archer.

01:05:36.273 --> 01:05:45.248
TRAVIS: Okay. Ten, 15, 16, 17.

01:05:45.248 --> 01:05:50.654
MATT: All right, so the one that's walking towards
the brazier falls off the wall on the side and

01:05:50.654 --> 01:05:54.154
slams into the mud there. And the other two
archers immediately go--

01:05:54.154 --> 01:05:55.742
TRAVIS: (shouting) Go!

01:05:55.742 --> 01:05:59.293
MATT: And they both pull and they're going to both
fire arrows down. One of them is going to fire at

01:05:59.293 --> 01:06:04.095
you-- actually they're both going to fire at you
because you killed their friend. You revealed

01:06:04.095 --> 01:06:05.873
yourself. They suck though-- that's an 11.

01:06:05.873 --> 01:06:07.063
TRAVIS: That will miss!

01:06:07.063 --> 01:06:08.814
MATT: Yeah. And a ten.

01:06:08.814 --> 01:06:10.780
TRAVIS: That misses as well!

01:06:10.780 --> 01:06:15.392
MATT: So you duck out on both sides and they both
go for secondary arrows and begin running towards

01:06:15.392 --> 01:06:17.243
the brazier themselves now. What are you guys
doing?

01:06:17.243 --> 01:06:19.854
LAURA: Oh no! You should hit them too because
they're going to light it.

01:06:19.854 --> 01:06:21.933
SAM: I'm going to jump up onto the wall.

01:06:21.933 --> 01:06:23.434
LAURA: Can you do that?

01:06:23.434 --> 01:06:31.271
SAM: I'm going to use my step of the wind which
doubles my jump distance. Distance, does that mean

01:06:31.271 --> 01:06:32.244
height?

01:06:32.244 --> 01:06:36.141
MATT: Well, yeah. But horizontal distance-- we'll
say height for this. What's your strength

01:06:36.141 --> 01:06:37.304
modifier?

01:06:37.304 --> 01:06:42.146
SAM: Four-- one. My strength modifier is one.

01:06:42.146 --> 01:06:50.317
MATT: Right. It doubles it, so you get (grunts).
I'll say you barely-- because of your height.

01:06:50.317 --> 01:06:55.331
Because you are an olog, you barely get your
fingers up on the top. Go ahead and make a

01:06:55.331 --> 01:06:57.184
strength saving throw to try and pull yourself up.

01:06:57.184 --> 01:07:00.925
SAM: Okay. (scoffs) Nine.

01:07:00.925 --> 01:07:06.675
MATT: You drop back down. It's just too high.

01:07:06.675 --> 01:07:09.876
LAURA: Are there any rocks around?

01:07:09.876 --> 01:07:12.575
MATT: Make an investigation check if you want to.

01:07:12.575 --> 01:07:16.305
DARIN: We did take a rest. Did we regain any spells
we use?

01:07:16.305 --> 01:07:19.744
MATT: No. It's a long rest.

01:07:19.744 --> 01:07:20.673
LAURA: 12.

01:07:20.673 --> 01:07:24.105
MATT: A 12? You find a small rock. In your hand,
it's really small.

01:07:24.105 --> 01:07:27.867
LAURA: I'm going to try to throw this little rock
at one of them.

01:07:27.867 --> 01:07:29.828
MATT: Make an attack roll. (laughs)

01:07:29.828 --> 01:07:32.565
LAURA: 11!

01:07:32.565 --> 01:07:35.881
MATT: It arcs over the wall.

01:07:35.881 --> 01:07:40.212
LAURA: I'm used to bigger-sized rocks, is all. Just
because they were so--

01:07:40.212 --> 01:07:42.083
SAM: To the shrak hole!

01:07:42.083 --> 01:07:43.851
LAURA: Wait, you have it. Try to hit it.

01:07:43.851 --> 01:07:45.856
TRAVIS: I'm going to try and hit him, one of the
last two.

01:07:45.856 --> 01:07:48.044
MATT: All right, go for it and they're going to go
again.

01:07:48.044 --> 01:07:50.398
TRAVIS: Okay. 15.

01:07:50.398 --> 01:07:51.940
MATT: 15 just barely hits!

01:07:51.940 --> 01:07:56.208
LAURA: We've got to get them before they light the
brazier!

01:07:56.208 --> 01:07:58.521
SAM: It'll be okay.

01:07:58.521 --> 01:08:01.385
MATT: It's technically not sneak attack because
you've already hit them.

01:08:01.385 --> 01:08:03.132
TRAVIS: Oh, thank you. Then that is only-- it's
only ten.

01:08:03.132 --> 01:08:09.509
MATT: Ten damage. Okay, so one of them gets hit
and he's still standing and he's going to whip

01:08:09.509 --> 01:08:13.113
around and try to fire back at you. The other one
that's running past is going to go ahead and pull

01:08:13.113 --> 01:08:20.031
out a torch and try to light it. All right, so
that ends your turn. They're going to go. One is

01:08:20.031 --> 01:08:24.423
going to take another shot at you. There we go!
That is a 24 to hit.

01:08:24.423 --> 01:08:26.902
DARIN: Do we all get-- I did not make an action.

01:08:26.902 --> 01:08:28.274
MATT: Oh shit! That's right, you didn't. So you
go.

01:08:28.274 --> 01:08:29.343
DARIN: Shrak hole.

01:08:29.343 --> 01:08:30.445
SAM: Shrak hole.

01:08:30.445 --> 01:08:31.113
LAURA: You go in?

01:08:31.113 --> 01:08:32.242
DARIN: Yes, I'm going in.

01:08:32.242 --> 01:08:42.023
MATT: Okay. So you go ahead and make a-- as you
dive into it, make an investigation check to try

01:08:42.023 --> 01:08:43.523
and feel your way through.

01:08:43.523 --> 01:08:44.888
LAURA: Eww!

01:08:44.888 --> 01:08:47.193
DARIN: Seven.

01:08:47.193 --> 01:08:53.864
MATT: You disappear into it and writhe around a
bunch to try and reach out for something. It's

01:08:53.864 --> 01:08:58.334
very taut. Even your uruk form is having a hard
time pulling underneath.

01:08:58.334 --> 01:09:00.927
DARIN: Again I feel alive.

01:09:00.927 --> 01:09:03.354
MATT: Indeed. (laughs) All right, so you--

01:09:03.354 --> 01:09:06.193
TRAVIS: Uncanny dodge, please.

01:09:06.193 --> 01:09:12.393
MATT: Yes. That would be seven points of piercing
damage, reduced to three and the other guy manages

01:09:12.393 --> 01:09:18.555
to light the brazier. The light goes bright. The
signal has been lit. What are you guys doing?

01:09:18.555 --> 01:09:24.824
TRAVIS: We should run to the front door and act
like we saw attackers running off in a different

01:09:24.824 --> 01:09:26.150
direction.

01:09:26.150 --> 01:09:27.345
LAURA: That's really smart.

01:09:27.345 --> 01:09:34.717
SAM: Split the party? He's in shrak right now. I'm
going to go in the shrak hole.

01:09:34.717 --> 01:09:43.471
LAURA: I'm going to pick up the body of the guy
that fell and try to throw him at the other guy.

01:09:43.471 --> 01:09:46.787
MATT: Make an attack roll!

01:09:46.787 --> 01:09:49.084
LAURA: Yeah? I'm big.

01:09:49.084 --> 01:09:51.774
MATT: This is just your strength modifier. You're
not proficient in bodies.

01:09:51.774 --> 01:09:55.229
TRAVIS: (laughs) Body chucking's not a thing?

01:09:55.229 --> 01:09:56.235
LAURA: Eight.

01:09:56.235 --> 01:10:02.838
MATT: Eight? (laughs) You slam it against the
wall. It slides down and hits the ground. You hear

01:10:02.838 --> 01:10:06.143
this horrible crunching sound as a number of
previously unbroken bones are now freshly broken

01:10:06.143 --> 01:10:09.811
in the dead body. You have another attack if you
want to walk up and try it again.

01:10:09.811 --> 01:10:12.524
LAURA: I want to try it again but this time, since
I didn't throw him high enough, I'm going to spin

01:10:12.524 --> 01:10:14.815
around and try to lob him up. Yeah.

01:10:14.815 --> 01:10:17.185
MATT: Okay. Make another attack roll with a
crumpled body.

01:10:17.185 --> 01:10:21.185
LAURA: (laughs) That's terrible! Seven!

01:10:21.185 --> 01:10:26.851
MATT: You release a little too early and it (heavy
impact) hits the wall right next to you. One of

01:10:26.851 --> 01:10:32.045
the arms tears and flies off against the mud. You
liquefied his insides at this point.

01:10:32.045 --> 01:10:34.297
LAURA: He's not feeling very good.

01:10:34.297 --> 01:10:35.503
TRAVIS: Are we going into the shrak hole?

01:10:35.503 --> 01:10:36.583
SAM: I'm going into the shrak hole!

01:10:36.583 --> 01:10:38.487
LAURA: How big is the shrak hole? Can all of us
fit in there?

01:10:38.487 --> 01:10:44.561
MATT: Well, as you dive in, it pushes you out the
other side. You get shoved out, plopped out,

01:10:44.561 --> 01:10:50.774
covered in shrak. And you look around, immediately
you can see, as you wipe your eyes off the

01:10:50.774 --> 01:10:55.386
shrak, everybody is now starting to look around at
the signal and begin to grab their weapons and

01:10:55.386 --> 01:11:00.534
start preparing for an incursion. You dive into
it. You get halfway in-- this is a very small

01:11:00.534 --> 01:11:05.558
space underneath and you're a very large olog. I'm
going to need you to make either an athletics

01:11:05.558 --> 01:11:08.785
check or an acrobatics check to try and push
through. Your choice.

01:11:08.785 --> 01:11:10.955
SAM: Acrobatics. 19.

01:11:10.955 --> 01:11:16.285
MATT: 19. You push through and watch as the bottom
of the wall splinters and breaks, but you manage

01:11:16.285 --> 01:11:22.607
to make your way through and now, you stand up
behind Mozuu, a good number of feet taller than

01:11:22.607 --> 01:11:27.422
him, also covered in shrak and you both now look
around at this chaos happening. What are you

01:11:27.422 --> 01:11:28.375
doing?

01:11:28.375 --> 01:11:30.065
LAURA: Well, go in, Skak.

01:11:30.065 --> 01:11:37.299
TRAVIS: No. Yes, and I jump in. I jump in after
him, in the shrak hole.

01:11:37.299 --> 01:11:42.436
MATT: All right. You dive in. The space has been
opened, thankfully. You follow through. They paved

01:11:42.436 --> 01:11:43.355
the path.

01:11:43.355 --> 01:11:45.886
TRAVIS: Oh, I could barely make it through! So
big.

01:11:45.886 --> 01:11:57.496
MATT: You glide through and now it's just you and
your friend, Borg, who's looking at the archers.

01:11:57.587 --> 01:12:01.972
Well, the archers, the one that's with the torch
is going to go ahead and try and take another

01:12:01.972 --> 01:12:05.837
shot. They're both taking a shot. One's going to
be at you and one's going to be at you, now that

01:12:05.837 --> 01:12:08.426
you guys are on that side. Against you, that is a
21.

01:12:08.426 --> 01:12:09.306
TRAVIS: Hits.

01:12:09.306 --> 01:12:12.128
MATT: You take-- ooh, nine points of piercing
damage.

01:12:12.128 --> 01:12:14.332
TRAVIS: Uncanny dodge. No, I already used my
reaction.

01:12:14.332 --> 01:12:18.964
MATT: Well, you used it from last time, so it
returns. So you have it back again. You can use

01:12:18.964 --> 01:12:25.907
it-- yeah. okay, it's reduced to four points of
piercing damage. And then one against you is a

01:12:25.907 --> 01:12:27.676
14.

01:12:27.676 --> 01:12:28.742
LAURA: Doesn't hit me.

01:12:28.742 --> 01:12:35.147
MATT: It breaks off the armor. They're both firing
arrows down at you. All right, so what are you

01:12:35.147 --> 01:12:40.997
guys doing? You glide underneath as they fire at
you. You slip under. You're back there with Borg.

01:12:40.997 --> 01:12:45.527
LAURA: I'm telling Borg to go through before me.
Go on.

01:12:45.527 --> 01:12:53.450
MATT: Dives in, like slowly wades into it (groans)
and goes under and pushes his way through without

01:12:53.450 --> 01:12:54.497
an issue.

01:12:54.497 --> 01:13:01.276
LAURA: All right. I'm going to gingerly lower
myself into the shrak and then go under slowly.

01:13:01.276 --> 01:13:09.744
MATT: Okay. As you guys get up on the other side,
you can now see about 40 to 50 various uruk have

01:13:09.744 --> 01:13:16.069
now gathered at the base of the wall where you're
standing. They're all armored and ready, their

01:13:16.069 --> 01:13:20.227
weapons are drawn and you are completely
surrounded on the interior of this wall. Nothing

01:13:20.227 --> 01:13:27.412
but liquid shrak at your back, as you all stand
there but they're all keeping at bay. You watch as

01:13:27.412 --> 01:13:35.282
a hand comes up behind the crowd and goes,
"Hold!" Everyone was like-- they are ready to tear

01:13:35.282 --> 01:13:45.067
at you but they begin to part at the center and
you watch with heavy steps as an olog-hai

01:13:45.067 --> 01:13:51.931
approaches with a giant, mutated underbite with
tusks that reach up past the nostril. The eyes

01:13:51.931 --> 01:13:58.337
peek through from heavily scarred muscle tissue
where a face once existed, but has since been torn

01:13:58.337 --> 01:14:05.606
and not healed very well over. You see, clutching
a giant greataxe in its grasp, what you assume to

01:14:05.606 --> 01:14:15.928
be Ur-Gram the Face-Eater, who's approached and goes,
"Who? Who enters &lt;i&gt;my&lt;/i&gt; home?"

01:14:15.928 --> 01:14:19.129
DARIN: The Bright Lord called to us.

01:14:19.129 --> 01:14:22.951
MATT: Make a deception check.

01:14:22.951 --> 01:14:28.372
DARIN: 15.

01:14:28.372 --> 01:14:36.018
MATT: "The Bright Lord, you say?"

01:14:36.018 --> 01:14:37.770
DARIN: Yes.

01:14:37.770 --> 01:14:45.410
MATT: "Then stand at me! Walk up and prove you
bear the mark!"

01:14:45.410 --> 01:14:52.709
DARIN: I bear no mark yet. I desire to.
I've literally gone through shrak for this moment.

01:14:52.709 --> 01:15:02.676
The Bright Lord spoke to me in my head. He told
me, the strong take what they want. And I want to

01:15:02.676 --> 01:15:04.837
be part of the Bright Lord's army.

01:15:04.837 --> 01:15:14.397
MATT: At this point, you see Ur-Gram is taken
aback by this response and glances over his

01:15:14.397 --> 01:15:22.818
shoulders. He steps back and you hear a voice from
behind him go, "Let me see this orc. Bring him

01:15:22.818 --> 01:15:29.816
"before me." And as Ur-Gram steps aside, you see a
human male standing with long, somewhat-tattered

01:15:29.816 --> 01:15:36.918
dark hair, beard towards the base of the chin,
wearing leather and hide armor and bits of

01:15:36.918 --> 01:15:46.999
chainmail beneath a dark cloak with a single long
blade extended to one side. All the rest of the

01:15:46.999 --> 01:15:52.500
various uruks around the area separate and back
away. As they do, you see a familiar flash in

01:15:52.500 --> 01:15:58.590
their eyes, that strange gray-white light that you
saw when you first had your fortress attacked. The

01:15:58.590 --> 01:16:07.005
human man walks forward. "You say you came this
far for the Bright Lord. Then come. Stand before

01:16:07.005 --> 01:16:10.665
"me. Be marked as you say your request."

01:16:10.665 --> 01:16:12.440
LAURA: (whispering) Mozuu! Mozuu!

01:16:12.440 --> 01:16:13.978
SAM: (whispering) He's been chosen.

01:16:13.978 --> 01:16:23.769
DARIN: I walk towards the Bright Lord. I kneel
before the Bright Lord. I am Mozuu the Chosen.

01:16:23.769 --> 01:16:25.811
Choose me, Bright Lord.

01:16:25.811 --> 01:16:33.832
MATT: As he looks down upon this snivelling uruk,
his hand protrudes forward and you see for a

01:16:33.832 --> 01:16:39.715
second, the outer image of his form begin to
shimmer and for a moment, you see a familiar sight

01:16:39.715 --> 01:16:45.738
you've only seen towards the outskirts of the dead
waste and swamps on the western side of Mordor.

01:16:45.738 --> 01:16:50.939
You see spiritual energy pull out of him and you
see for a brief instant, a wraith-like form of

01:16:50.939 --> 01:16:56.830
some long-dead elf that marks the exterior of his
body. As the hand reaches forward, this voice

01:16:56.830 --> 01:17:04.882
echoes around. "Come. May you join the rest of
this army." Takes the hand and places it against

01:17:04.882 --> 01:17:06.700
the side of Mozuu's face.

01:17:06.700 --> 01:17:11.620
LAURA: I scream out, No! And run forward and try
to tackle him. Manswine!

01:17:11.620 --> 01:17:15.611
(laughter)

01:17:15.611 --> 01:17:18.032
MATT: I need you all to roll initiative right
now.

01:17:18.032 --> 01:17:23.378
TRAVIS: Oh crap, oh crap, oh crap!

01:17:23.378 --> 01:17:27.388
DARIN: That's really something!

01:17:27.425 --> 01:17:28.930
LAURA: Oh shrak, oh shrak, oh shrak!

01:17:28.930 --> 01:17:30.337
DARIN: So much for that idea.

01:17:30.337 --> 01:17:35.739
MATT: Okay. You rolled a 12 initiative?

01:17:35.739 --> 01:17:36.970
DARIN: Yeah.

01:17:36.970 --> 01:17:38.251
MATT: All right. So we have--

01:17:38.251 --> 01:17:41.818
SAM: Nine here.

01:17:41.818 --> 01:17:43.490
MATT: All righty.

01:17:43.490 --> 01:17:44.998
LAURA: 18.

01:17:44.998 --> 01:17:51.336
MATT: Oh wow. You are dead even with the tark.

01:17:51.336 --> 01:17:53.429
TRAVIS: 16 for me.

01:17:53.429 --> 01:18:05.717
MATT: Okay. All right, so top of the round. Arby.
As you go charging forward right as the hand

01:18:05.717 --> 01:18:09.419
reaches to grab the side of Mozuu's face, what are
you going to do?

01:18:09.419 --> 01:18:11.290
LAURA: I'm going to--

01:18:11.290 --> 01:18:13.224
MATT: Make a shove attack or try and push him out
of the way?

01:18:13.224 --> 01:18:15.189
LAURA: I was trying to push him off of Mozuu.

01:18:15.189 --> 01:18:20.060
MATT: Okay then. Making a shove attack for your
first strike. I believe I need you to make an

01:18:20.060 --> 01:18:26.371
athletics check. I'm checking here. It doesn't
happen &lt;i&gt;too&lt;/i&gt; often.

01:18:26.371 --> 01:18:27.771
LAURA: 20!

01:18:27.771 --> 01:18:39.329
MATT: 20. Okay. Yep, contested against athletics
or acrobatics. All righty. Weirdly enough, you

01:18:39.329 --> 01:18:45.200
manage to get in fast enough. Your large olog-hai
form (heavy footsteps) and slam with your shoulder

01:18:45.200 --> 01:18:50.140
into this tark. He goes flying off, spinning in the
air and landing, barely catching himself as he

01:18:50.140 --> 01:18:55.890
skids back about ten feet or so. Looks up at you
and still the wraith form is on the outside. The

01:18:55.890 --> 01:19:01.630
eyes flash with this vibrant scary white light and
the wraith form fits back into the body. As the

01:19:01.630 --> 01:19:08.504
tark stands to his feet, the blade at his side and
goes, "Very well. So you've chosen death."

01:19:08.504 --> 01:19:10.620
LAURA: (shouting) Death!

01:19:10.620 --> 01:19:12.275
(laughter)

01:19:12.275 --> 01:19:15.460
MATT: All right. So you still have another attack
if you want to take it.

01:19:15.460 --> 01:19:23.566
LAURA: Okay! I want to keep attacking him! I don't
know which dice to use though. Okay! 26!

01:19:23.566 --> 01:19:25.622
MATT: 26 hits!

01:19:25.622 --> 01:19:32.499
LAURA: (shouting) Man-filth! 14!

01:19:32.499 --> 01:19:41.963
MATT: (laughs) 14 points of damage. Nice! All
right. So as you hit him, you hear a ringing out

01:19:41.963 --> 01:19:49.389
behind him, the voice of the Face-Eater himself,
Ur-Gram says, "Gravewalker! Smash the invaders!"

01:19:49.389 --> 01:19:53.220
TRAVIS: Oh jeez.

01:19:53.220 --> 01:19:54.631
LAURA: We're all going to die!

01:19:54.631 --> 01:19:56.477
(laughter)

01:19:56.477 --> 01:19:58.533
TRAVIS: There's only 40 of them. 40 or 50.

01:19:58.533 --> 01:20:04.292
MATT: All right. So at this point, the gravewalker, 
who's now up in front of you, takes the hit and

01:20:04.292 --> 01:20:11.753
glares back at you with the burning white eyes.
He's going to go ahead and make two strikes on you

01:20:11.753 --> 01:20:16.052
with Urfael, his sword. That is a 21.

01:20:16.052 --> 01:20:17.459
LAURA: That hits me.

01:20:17.459 --> 01:20:26.490
MATT: And that is seven points of slashing damage.
And 19.

01:20:26.490 --> 01:20:28.232
LAURA: Ugh. That also hits.

01:20:28.232 --> 01:20:34.533
MATT: That is six points of slashing damage and
then he is going to go ahead and attempt a shadow

01:20:34.533 --> 01:20:41.582
strike attack. As it strikes you twice with the
sword, sidesteps to the side and looks around at

01:20:41.582 --> 01:20:48.576
you and that is a 16. What's your armor class?

01:20:48.576 --> 01:20:49.587
TRAVIS: 16!

01:20:49.587 --> 01:20:55.025
MATT: 16! It hits you! As you watch the
gravewalker suddenly vanishes from his place, a

01:20:55.025 --> 01:21:00.102
streak of vibrant white light shoots between the
two of you and appears right in front of you,

01:21:00.102 --> 01:21:06.410
before striking down. That's an 18 to hit?

01:21:06.410 --> 01:21:08.121
TRAVIS: (laughs) Yeah, it hits!

01:21:08.121 --> 01:21:14.312
MATT: All right. You suffer five points of-- I'm
sorry, nine points of slashing damage and four

01:21:14.312 --> 01:21:15.973
points of radiant damage.

01:21:15.973 --> 01:21:19.021
TRAVIS: Whoa, so can I use uncanny dodge on the
slashing but not the radiant?

01:21:19.021 --> 01:21:20.642
MATT: Well, it's against the whole attack.

01:21:20.642 --> 01:21:24.212
TRAVIS: So 13 points down to seven?

01:21:24.212 --> 01:21:29.198
MATT: Correct. Down to six, it would be. All
right. And that's going to end the gravewalker's

01:21:29.198 --> 01:21:31.988
turn. All right. Ending that, Skak, you're up.

01:21:31.988 --> 01:21:41.138
TRAVIS: (shrieks) Please! Let us live! Let us
live! I want to be with you! And I will aim my

01:21:41.138 --> 01:21:43.757
crossbow over at Eden.

01:21:43.757 --> 01:21:45.575
(laughter)

01:21:45.575 --> 01:21:51.378
TRAVIS: And I'll pull the trigger.

01:21:51.378 --> 01:21:55.986
MATT: (laughs) Okay! Roll. Go for it.

01:21:55.986 --> 01:22:01.486
TRAVIS: Is he within melee of one of my 40 or 50
of my new allies?

01:22:01.486 --> 01:22:05.525
MATT: No. What was once an ally is now no
longer--

01:22:05.525 --> 01:22:07.097
TRAVIS: 23.

01:22:07.097 --> 01:22:10.362
SAM: That hits, but I'll use deflect missiles.

01:22:10.362 --> 01:22:12.856
MATT: Roll for damage.

01:22:12.856 --> 01:22:16.616
TRAVIS: (laughs) Ah, shit! Seven.

01:22:16.616 --> 01:22:22.285
SAM: I reduce that by more than seven points.

01:22:22.285 --> 01:22:25.357
MATT: So as you fire the crossbow bolt, you watch
as Eden--

01:22:25.357 --> 01:22:29.530
SAM: (catches bolt) (bolt whooshes)

01:22:29.530 --> 01:22:30.646
TRAVIS: Oh!

01:22:30.646 --> 01:22:32.872
(laughter)

01:22:32.872 --> 01:22:35.746
MATT: So you spend a ki point and go ahead and
roll an attack with it. It's considered

01:22:35.746 --> 01:22:36.589
proficient.

01:22:36.589 --> 01:22:37.859
LAURA: Oh my god. You get to attack him?

01:22:37.859 --> 01:22:40.605
MATT: Yeah. If you reduce the damage past what it
did, you get to throw it back at him.

01:22:40.605 --> 01:22:41.895
LAURA: That's awesome!

01:22:41.895 --> 01:22:45.209
SAM: 16. I rolled a 16 plus I don't
know.

01:22:45.209 --> 01:22:50.267
MATT: Yeah, that hits! So go and roll damage. So
it's a d8 plus your dexterity.

01:22:50.267 --> 01:22:52.284
SAM: Oh. My dexterity is plus four.

01:22:52.284 --> 01:22:53.778
MATT: Yeah. So d8 plus four.

01:22:53.778 --> 01:22:56.484
TRAVIS: (scared voice) Play along! Tell a joke!

01:22:56.484 --> 01:22:58.835
SAM: Eight plus four.

01:22:58.835 --> 01:23:00.423
MATT: 12 points of piercing damage.

01:23:00.423 --> 01:23:02.596
TRAVIS: I can't use uncanny dodge--

01:23:02.596 --> 01:23:04.808
MATT: No, you already used it! (laughs)

01:23:04.808 --> 01:23:10.256
LAURA: What are you at right now?

01:23:10.256 --> 01:23:11.499
TRAVIS: Eight.

01:23:11.499 --> 01:23:15.687
MATT: Good to know. All right, at the end of your
turn-- you still have a bonus action if you want

01:23:15.687 --> 01:23:17.050
to try something.

01:23:17.050 --> 01:23:19.826
TRAVIS: I want to hide behind the gravewalker's
legs!

01:23:19.826 --> 01:23:21.437
(laughter)

01:23:21.437 --> 01:23:27.818
MATT: Okay! So you move behind the gravewalker?
All right, at the end of your turn, he's going to

01:23:27.818 --> 01:23:34.027
use two of his legendary actions to try a dominate
on you.

01:23:34.027 --> 01:23:35.705
TRAVIS: Me?

01:23:35.705 --> 01:23:37.418
MATT: Yes. So as you reach behind--

01:23:37.418 --> 01:23:39.427
SAM: You've shown yourself to be weak.

01:23:39.427 --> 01:23:40.731
(laughter)

01:23:40.731 --> 01:23:42.596
TRAVIS: I was born this way.

01:23:42.596 --> 01:23:48.857
MATT: It's an 18. So he reaches behind and as he's
still staring forward, grasps the side of your

01:23:48.857 --> 01:23:52.510
face and you feel this burning, singeing
sensation. Make a wisdom saving throw.

01:23:52.510 --> 01:23:57.170
TRAVIS: 13.

01:23:57.170 --> 01:24:03.933
MATT: 13. The mark, the brand of the gravewalker
now burned into your face. You see the majesty of

01:24:03.933 --> 01:24:08.788
the Bright Lord before you and you understand.
This is the one to follow.

01:24:08.788 --> 01:24:10.650
TRAVIS: This is the one to follow.

01:24:10.650 --> 01:24:14.789
MATT: So whereas you may have decided to change
allegiance before, it's solidified now. You are

01:24:14.789 --> 01:24:17.630
working for the gravewalker.

01:24:17.630 --> 01:24:19.410
TRAVIS: Yes! Bright Lord!

01:24:19.410 --> 01:24:25.418
MATT: All right. That ends that turn. Mozuu,
you're up. The rest of the uruks are stepping back

01:24:25.418 --> 01:24:28.320
and watching this. They're just enjoying the
fray.

01:24:28.320 --> 01:24:31.460
DARIN: I stand ready to be chosen.

01:24:31.460 --> 01:24:40.535
MATT: (laughs) So you stay there and still
kneeling, 20 feet away? All righty. That's your

01:24:40.535 --> 01:24:41.464
whole--

01:24:41.464 --> 01:24:49.780
DARIN: There's two things I know. The Bright Lord
is my new master and I am merely Mozuu unless you

01:24:49.780 --> 01:24:51.891
choose me.

01:24:51.891 --> 01:24:59.746
MATT: (evil laughter) Perfect. All right, that
ends Mozuu's turn. Eden, you're up, having just

01:24:59.746 --> 01:25:02.251
thrown the bolt back at Skak.

01:25:02.251 --> 01:25:11.223
SAM: I look over at Arby, trying to get a sense of
what-- is she on my side?

01:25:11.223 --> 01:25:13.026
(laughter)

01:25:13.026 --> 01:25:20.015
LAURA: I got a lot of shrak falling off me right
now.

01:25:20.015 --> 01:25:31.990
SAM: (sighs) This is not going to end well. Our
leader, Barfta, told us if we found where they

01:25:31.990 --> 01:25:36.749
were, that would be a reward. I'm going to leave.

01:25:36.749 --> 01:25:41.293
(laughter)

01:25:41.293 --> 01:25:45.553
SAM: I can't win this fight!

01:25:45.553 --> 01:25:47.361
MATT: All right. So--

01:25:47.361 --> 01:25:49.028
TRAVIS: Not with &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; attitude!

01:25:49.028 --> 01:25:51.920
SAM: Everyone's turning into bad guys!

01:25:51.920 --> 01:25:55.201
TRAVIS: Well, technically, we &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; bad guys.

01:25:55.201 --> 01:26:04.302
SAM: That's right. Oh, I don't know what to do! I
can't beat that guy. He's a wraith! I'm going to--

01:26:04.302 --> 01:26:06.351
MATT: You're going to run?

01:26:06.351 --> 01:26:11.240
SAM: --spend my last ki point and run as fast as I
can through the shrak.

01:26:11.240 --> 01:26:22.715
MATT: You're like-- dive back into the shrak hole
underneath. It's easy enough for you to push past

01:26:22.715 --> 01:26:28.757
now, since you made way earlier. You pop out on
the other side and start bolting away. All right.

01:26:28.757 --> 01:26:34.052
At the end of your turn, the gravewalker's going
to go ahead and use his last legendary action--

01:26:34.052 --> 01:26:41.349
seeing you dart away, he's going to turn back
towards you. He's going to go ahead and the blade

01:26:41.349 --> 01:26:46.892
goes away for a second and pulls his bow, Azkar,
out and pulls back an arrow, releases it.

01:26:46.892 --> 01:26:51.425
Actually, that's a 12! Rolled really low.

01:26:51.425 --> 01:26:54.502
LAURA: I dodge it. It's all the shrak on me, it
slips off.

01:26:54.502 --> 01:26:58.290
MATT: It slips off and you're unmoving.
Unbreakable, even.

01:26:58.290 --> 01:26:59.524
LAURA: Unbreakable!

01:26:59.524 --> 01:27:04.433
MATT: All right. Back to the top. It's now Arby
and the gravewalker's turn.

01:27:04.433 --> 01:27:06.838
LAURA: I run over and I try to hit him!

01:27:06.838 --> 01:27:10.808
MATT: All right, you rush, maul swinging in the
air. Go for it.

01:27:10.808 --> 01:27:14.608
LAURA: Oh no! That's 11!

01:27:14.608 --> 01:27:20.932
MATT: 11? You go and swing and you watch as the
form shimmies by and he dodges right out of the

01:27:20.932 --> 01:27:22.881
way, preternaturally fast.

01:27:22.881 --> 01:27:26.708
LAURA: You're tricky, you! I try to hit him
again!

01:27:26.708 --> 01:27:28.187
MATT: Okay.

01:27:28.187 --> 01:27:34.157
LAURA: Oh no! That's only 11, again!

01:27:34.157 --> 01:27:39.497
MATT: (laughs) The second swing goes wide and for
a second, you're sure you made contact but in the

01:27:39.497 --> 01:27:45.036
space where the hammer goes, you watch as the
gravewalker stands back into place. "You sow chaos

01:27:45.036 --> 01:27:46.743
"and invite it."

01:27:46.743 --> 01:27:49.765
LAURA: I don't even know what you mean.

01:27:49.765 --> 01:27:58.198
MATT: "Bow or crumple before your Bright Lord. The
choice matters not, for death has already found me

01:27:58.198 --> 01:28:04.650
"once and lost." And he's going to go ahead and
attempt a wraith stun attack against you. That is

01:28:04.650 --> 01:28:06.301
23 to hit?

01:28:06.301 --> 01:28:07.417
LAURA: Oh no!

01:28:07.417 --> 01:28:14.441
MATT: All right. You take ten points of radiant
damage.

01:28:14.441 --> 01:28:22.859
LAURA: I'm going to use my troll's endurance! And
I'm going to take that down by ten.

01:28:22.859 --> 01:28:26.148
MATT: By ten? So it hits you and you resist the
damage but I still need you to make a constitution

01:28:26.148 --> 01:28:27.187
saving throw.

01:28:27.187 --> 01:28:32.422
LAURA: Oh no. 21!

01:28:32.422 --> 01:28:38.977
MATT: Okay. You feel the impact, the wraith
energies, but your physical form, being a tough

01:28:38.977 --> 01:28:45.104
olog-hai, you resist the stunning effect of the
strike and push through it. No stun on you

01:28:45.104 --> 01:28:51.086
whatsoever. And then he's going to go ahead and
follow up with two more attacks with Urfael, as

01:28:51.086 --> 01:28:56.379
the bow's been put by the side. He's going to
swing twice with the blade against you. That is a

01:28:56.379 --> 01:29:04.602
15? It just slides off your armor. Second strike,
that's cocked. Natural one.

01:29:04.602 --> 01:29:06.484
ALL: Yeah!

01:29:06.484 --> 01:29:11.267
MATT: So he swings a second time and you actually
catch the blade in your hand. You feel it like

01:29:11.267 --> 01:29:15.478
cutting into your grip a little bit, but you
tighten as you stare down at the gravewalker.

01:29:15.478 --> 01:29:20.671
Unmoved at this threatening presence that's
looking up at you, like it's only an

01:29:20.671 --> 01:29:21.798
inevitability.

01:29:21.798 --> 01:29:23.816
LAURA: I'm a boss fight, pig-skin!

01:29:23.816 --> 01:29:26.584
(laughter)

01:29:26.584 --> 01:29:33.746
MATT: All right. So that's going to go ahead and
end their turn. Skak, you're up.

01:29:33.746 --> 01:29:43.172
TRAVIS: I serve the Bright Master! Can I hold my
attack and ask for one of the large uruks or

01:29:43.172 --> 01:29:49.194
uruk-hais to pick me up and throw me above the
wall so I can take a crossbow shot at fleeing

01:29:49.194 --> 01:29:50.353
Eden?

01:29:50.353 --> 01:29:56.434
MATT: Sure, you glance off to the side and one of
the ologs who's off to the side there, has chains

01:29:56.434 --> 01:30:03.821
around the chest, you can see maybe it was more
of the physical-handy ologs as opposed to warrior.

01:30:03.821 --> 01:30:07.214
Looks at you with a nod. Make a persuasion check.

01:30:07.214 --> 01:30:13.849
TRAVIS: We all must serve, answer the call! Yeah,
that's going to be a 19.

01:30:13.849 --> 01:30:22.758
MATT: 19! The olog picks you up and gives
you an alley-oop into the air. Yeah, easily

01:30:22.758 --> 01:30:27.069
enough, you arc up. Make an acrobatics check to
try and land your feet on the wall.

01:30:27.069 --> 01:30:29.580
TRAVIS: 21.

01:30:29.580 --> 01:30:36.557
MATT: You land on the edge of the wall and you
glance up, just passing, you can see Eden darting

01:30:36.557 --> 01:30:38.170
away.

01:30:38.170 --> 01:30:39.638
TRAVIS: We cannot flee!

01:30:39.638 --> 01:30:42.947
MATT: Make an attack!

01:30:42.947 --> 01:30:48.810
TRAVIS: Does he know what's coming? Any chance of
sneak attack? He's on the other side of the wall.

01:30:48.810 --> 01:30:51.978
MATT: I will say, he's not aware of your presence.
Sure, I'll allow it.

01:30:51.978 --> 01:31:02.929
TRAVIS: Yeah! 15, 17, 18.

01:31:02.929 --> 01:31:05.429
MATT: 18 points of piercing damage.

01:31:05.429 --> 01:31:13.279
SAM: I will use my troll's endurance to reduce
that by 11 points.

01:31:13.279 --> 01:31:15.488
LAURA: Seven points.

01:31:15.488 --> 01:31:20.778
MATT: So crossbow bolt catches you in the back of
the shoulder blades, right where the spine meets

01:31:20.778 --> 01:31:22.811
them. Your body tenses for a second.

01:31:22.811 --> 01:31:39.823
SAM: I touch the arrow and I say, ugh! He's right.
Forcs don't run. They stick in meat and they stay

01:31:39.930 --> 01:31:43.571
there forever. And I turn around and I run back
into the shrak hole!

01:31:43.571 --> 01:31:46.533
(laughing)

01:31:46.533 --> 01:31:54.862
MATT: All right, so when you get to your turn,
you're bolting back. All right. So Mozuu, it's

01:31:54.862 --> 01:31:57.065
back up to your turn.

01:31:57.065 --> 01:31:59.618
DARIN: Can I hold it until the actions are done?

01:31:59.618 --> 01:32:01.752
MATT: I mean, pretty much everyone else is gone.

01:32:01.752 --> 01:32:11.051
DARIN: Can I speak to the Bright Lord? I said I
heard the voice of Sauron. I lied. I never heard

01:32:11.051 --> 01:32:16.943
anything, but I will hear your voice if you would
speak to me.

01:32:16.943 --> 01:32:25.123
MATT: Okay. You use that as your action? All
right, at the top. It is Arby and Talion's turn.

01:32:25.123 --> 01:32:27.309
So, what are you doing?

01:32:27.309 --> 01:32:31.548
LAURA: Do I still have a hold of his blade?

01:32:31.548 --> 01:32:33.184
MATT: Currently, yeah.

01:32:33.184 --> 01:32:39.793
LAURA: Oh, yeah. Can I try to smack it with
himself and say stop hitting yourself! Stop

01:32:39.793 --> 01:32:41.125
hitting yourself!

01:32:41.125 --> 01:32:46.453
MATT: Sure. All right. Go ahead and make-- this
would be an athletics versus athletics.

01:32:46.453 --> 01:32:50.207
LAURA: A 14.

01:32:50.207 --> 01:32:55.674
MATT: 23. As you attempt to do it, he pulls the
blade from your grasp. Cuts your hand a little bit

01:32:55.674 --> 01:32:57.233
but nothing too major.

01:32:57.233 --> 01:33:00.737
LAURA: All right, then I'm going to try to attack
him then.

01:33:00.737 --> 01:33:04.489
MATT: So you have one more attack.

01:33:04.489 --> 01:33:05.644
LAURA: That is a 20!

01:33:05.644 --> 01:33:06.872
MATT: 20 hits!

01:33:06.872 --> 01:33:13.001
LAURA: Seven plus five is 12.

01:33:13.001 --> 01:33:18.123
MATT: All right. 12 points of damage. This time,
the gravewalker gets taken off his feet a little

01:33:18.123 --> 01:33:22.605
bit. He rolls a little bit, just around the side
and gets back up to his feet, maybe five feet,

01:33:22.605 --> 01:33:28.726
almost ten feet from you. Blade's still out, looks
at you, looks at the surrounding scenarios. Seems

01:33:28.726 --> 01:33:32.005
to become somewhat impressed by the fact that
you're still fighting in the midst of such

01:33:32.005 --> 01:33:34.537
immeasurable danger.

01:33:34.537 --> 01:33:45.024
LAURA: And as my bonus action, I'm going to take
my second wind. I'm going to take 1d10 and add five to it.

01:33:45.024 --> 01:33:48.175
So 14 points of damage added back!

01:33:48.175 --> 01:33:53.654
MATT: There you go. At which point, the
gravewalker turns his back on you and steps

01:33:53.654 --> 01:34:00.735
towards Mozuu and says, "Then prove to me. Prove
to me you have what it takes." And reaches down

01:34:00.735 --> 01:34:04.034
and grabs your face, this time finally making
contact. Go ahead and make a wisdom saving throw.

01:34:04.034 --> 01:34:08.196
You can opt to not resist it if you'd like to.

01:34:08.196 --> 01:34:10.581
DARIN: That is 16.

01:34:10.581 --> 01:34:14.314
MATT: Do you want to resist it or you want to let
it happen?

01:34:14.314 --> 01:34:15.475
DARIN: I'm on board.

01:34:15.475 --> 01:34:18.953
MATT: Then you don't need to make a saving throw.
Then that being the case, the brand burns in the

01:34:18.953 --> 01:34:24.425
side of your face. You watch as Mozuu's eyes flare
with a vibrant energy. And as it fades, you now

01:34:24.425 --> 01:34:27.844
see that indeed, this prophecy you spoke earlier
seems to be true.

01:34:27.844 --> 01:34:29.512
DARIN: I'm truly chosen.

01:34:29.512 --> 01:34:34.436
MATT: You are now. As the brand is there, you
glance back and see the pittance that is the

01:34:34.436 --> 01:34:42.077
existence of your previous allies. And the Bright
Lord, as you stand up, goes, "Kill for me." And

01:34:42.077 --> 01:34:44.696
looks back towards Arby.

01:34:44.696 --> 01:34:47.958
TRAVIS: Not me, we're on the same team!

01:34:47.958 --> 01:34:50.015
DARIN: Right, buddy!

01:34:50.072 --> 01:34:52.658
TRAVIS: Betrayers unite!

01:34:52.658 --> 01:34:58.013
MATT: And with that, he's going to go ahead and
pull back Azkar and take two arrow shots at you.

01:34:58.013 --> 01:35:00.895
That is a 23.

01:35:00.895 --> 01:35:02.357
LAURA: Oh, that hits me!

01:35:02.357 --> 01:35:03.664
MATT: And a 19.

01:35:03.664 --> 01:35:04.822
LAURA: Oh no!

01:35:04.822 --> 01:35:12.745
MATT: All right. That is 11 points of piercing
damage and seven points of piercing damage. Both

01:35:12.745 --> 01:35:17.730
arrows slam into your armor; you can feel the
plates break and crumble. These are not normal

01:35:17.730 --> 01:35:22.326
arrows, not with the strength that they're being
tossed at you. That's going to end the

01:35:22.326 --> 01:35:26.265
gravewalker's turn. Skak, you're up. You can see
Eden running back.

01:35:26.265 --> 01:35:29.327
TRAVIS: Yeah. Crossbow.

01:35:29.327 --> 01:35:32.195
MATT: You want to try and hide first?

01:35:32.195 --> 01:35:36.714
TRAVIS: Oh! Does it up my-- if I'm from a hidden
position?

01:35:36.714 --> 01:35:41.295
MATT: Well, if you can manage to hide and move and
he's not aware of where you are? I'll allow it.

01:35:41.295 --> 01:35:43.335
TRAVIS: I will use my bonus action to try and
hide.

01:35:43.335 --> 01:35:44.956
MATT: Okay. So make a stealth check.

01:35:44.956 --> 01:35:46.766
TRAVIS: 27.

01:35:46.766 --> 01:35:48.907
MATT: Make a perception check if you like, Eden.

01:35:48.907 --> 01:35:51.191
SAM: Natural 20.

01:35:51.191 --> 01:35:53.477
TRAVIS: Oh my god!

01:35:53.477 --> 01:36:02.090
MATT: So right as he's running, he glances up and
catches you. Skak, make your attack. No sneak

01:36:02.156 --> 01:36:03.570
attack on this one, unfortunately.

01:36:03.570 --> 01:36:05.450
TRAVIS: Damn! Oh, that's pretty good. 25.

01:36:05.450 --> 01:36:12.262
SAM: That hits, but I will catch that shit. I
mean, catch that shrak and throw it back.

01:36:12.262 --> 01:36:13.891
MATT: Do you have any ki left?

01:36:13.891 --> 01:36:16.021
SAM: It doesn't say I need ki!

01:36:16.021 --> 01:36:18.245
MATT: To throw it back, you need to spend a ki.

01:36:18.245 --> 01:36:20.490
SAM: Oh, I see. I can catch it.

01:36:20.490 --> 01:36:33.420
TRAVIS: 12 points of damage, and I will use fury of
the small to add five extra damage to it, so 17.

01:36:33.420 --> 01:36:35.440
SAM: I rolled 17.

01:36:35.440 --> 01:36:36.863
MATT: What?!

01:36:36.863 --> 01:36:41.337
SAM: It's 1d10 plus nine. So I rolled an
eight.

01:36:41.337 --> 01:36:43.117
TRAVIS: What happens?

01:36:43.117 --> 01:36:46.199
MATT: So as he's running, and just catches it.

01:36:46.199 --> 01:36:50.661
TRAVIS: It's not fair. It's not fair!

01:36:50.661 --> 01:36:53.931
I can only do that once a day!

01:36:53.931 --> 01:36:59.403
MATT: All right. Ending Skak's turn. Mozuu, you're
up.

01:36:59.403 --> 01:37:01.771
DARIN: Sorry.

01:37:01.771 --> 01:37:04.644
LAURA: Yeah, you're real sorry. Chosen.

01:37:04.644 --> 01:37:09.479
DARIN: I leap at Arb-Uruk and attempt to rip her
throat out.

01:37:09.479 --> 01:37:14.792
MATT: All right. Make an athletics check against
Arb-Uruk. You make an athletics check as well, as

01:37:14.792 --> 01:37:16.093
it's opposed.

01:37:16.093 --> 01:37:18.739
DARIN: 20.

01:37:18.739 --> 01:37:22.702
LAURA: Oh, no. Athletics. Oh no, he gets me. 12.

01:37:22.702 --> 01:37:26.729
MATT: So you leap onto the front of her. Which, by
the way, you're small in comparison. You're like

01:37:26.729 --> 01:37:30.695
this spider climbing up the body up to the throat.
Go ahead and make an attack.

01:37:30.695 --> 01:37:36.469
DARIN: Okay. 16 plus three. 19.

01:37:36.469 --> 01:37:39.702
MATT: 19. Armor class is 18. Roll a d4 plus your
strength modifier.

01:37:39.702 --> 01:37:43.601
DARIN: That is a five.

01:37:43.601 --> 01:37:48.181
MATT: So you take five points of piercing damage
as Mozuu begins biting chunks out of your throat.

01:37:48.181 --> 01:37:50.661
DARIN: Do I get another attack or is leaping the
attack?

01:37:50.661 --> 01:37:52.151
MATT: I'll consider leaping as part of it.

01:37:52.151 --> 01:37:53.616
DARIN: That's a good thing. Sorry.

01:37:53.616 --> 01:37:54.984
TRAVIS: Sorry!

01:37:54.984 --> 01:37:56.184
MATT: All right. Eden, you're up.

01:37:56.184 --> 01:37:59.551
SAM: Do I have enough movement to get under the
shrak hole?

01:37:59.551 --> 01:38:04.351
MATT: As you ran and then came right back, you
come up from underneath and you're out of the

01:38:04.351 --> 01:38:10.800
shrak hole and you see now Mozuu latched onto
Arb-Uruk, biting into the throat.

01:38:10.800 --> 01:38:12.432
SAM: I'm going to attack Mozuu.

01:38:12.432 --> 01:38:13.611
MATT: Go for it.

01:38:13.611 --> 01:38:15.190
SAM: Or is the Bright--

01:38:15.190 --> 01:38:18.195
MATT: The Bright Lord is not that far from you.
You can get to the Bright Lord. You're pretty fast.

01:38:18.195 --> 01:38:19.507
LAURA: Attack Mozuu!

01:38:19.507 --> 01:38:23.124
SAM: I'll attack Mozuu. I choose Mozuu the
Chosen.

01:38:23.124 --> 01:38:24.456
MATT: Go for it.

01:38:24.456 --> 01:38:25.625
SAM: Mozuu!

01:38:25.625 --> 01:38:28.172
DARIN: Mozuu!

01:38:28.172 --> 01:38:31.275
SAM: 20 to hit.

01:38:31.275 --> 01:38:33.828
MATT: 20 to hit? That hits Mozuu, I think.

01:38:33.828 --> 01:38:38.318
DARIN: Oh yes, I'm at 18. Otherwise known as, ow.

01:38:38.318 --> 01:38:40.447
SAM: Eight plus four. 12.

01:38:40.447 --> 01:38:46.072
MATT: So 12 points of bludgeoning damage as out of
nowhere, Eden rushes forward and slams you in the

01:38:46.072 --> 01:38:50.342
side of the body. Almost knocking you off of
Arb-Uruk but not quite strong enough to do so.

01:38:50.342 --> 01:38:54.573
SAM: A second attack. 11 plus seven. 18 to hit!

01:38:54.573 --> 01:38:56.516
MATT: That hits. Roll damage again!

01:38:56.516 --> 01:39:01.555
SAM: Two plus four. So that's six more points of
damage.

01:39:01.555 --> 01:39:04.420
MATT: Six more points of bludgeoning damage. And
you have your bonus action still, if you want to.

01:39:04.420 --> 01:39:09.058
SAM: Oh! One more hit. This is an open-handed hit,
right?

01:39:09.058 --> 01:39:10.533
MATT: I believe so, yeah.

01:39:10.533 --> 01:39:15.749
SAM: No good. That's a 13 to hit.

01:39:15.749 --> 01:39:19.930
MATT: 13. The third and final hit, you manage to
deflect it with your with your arm. It makes no

01:39:19.930 --> 01:39:23.408
impact there. Ending Eden's turn. Up to you and
the gravewalker.

01:39:23.408 --> 01:39:30.854
LAURA: Can I grab a hold of Mozuu and rip him off
me and then hit the gravewalker with him?

01:39:30.854 --> 01:39:32.483
MATT: Sure! Go for it!

01:39:32.483 --> 01:39:35.214
MATT: So make an athletics check and you make an
athletics check as well.

01:39:35.214 --> 01:39:38.590
LAURA: 13.

01:39:38.590 --> 01:39:40.640
DARIN: Ten.

01:39:40.640 --> 01:39:44.763
MATT: Yeah, you tear him off. Go ahead and make an
attack roll. You don't get the proficiency bonus

01:39:44.763 --> 01:39:47.270
on this but you still get your strength bonus.

01:39:47.270 --> 01:39:50.894
LAURA: Just my strength modifier? 18.

01:39:50.894 --> 01:40:00.114
MATT: 18 hits the gravewalker! His AC is 17! I'll
say for this one, roll a d6 and add your strength

01:40:00.114 --> 01:40:01.842
modifier.

01:40:01.842 --> 01:40:05.717
SAM: Kill the tark! For the glory of the uruk!

01:40:05.717 --> 01:40:08.252
MATT: You don't get to reroll your damage roll
because he's not considered--

01:40:08.252 --> 01:40:09.931
LAURA: He's not a two-handed weapon?

01:40:09.931 --> 01:40:13.662
MATT: Sure! You know what, sure! I'll let him be a
two-handed weapon. Yeah, I'll allow it.

01:40:13.662 --> 01:40:14.709
LAURA: So that's ten.

01:40:14.709 --> 01:40:17.427
MATT: So ten points of bludgeoning damage to both
you and the gravewalker.

01:40:17.427 --> 01:40:18.537
DARIN: Guess what?

01:40:18.537 --> 01:40:19.567
MATT and TRAVIS: What?

01:40:19.567 --> 01:40:22.307
LAURA: You're unconscious?

01:40:22.307 --> 01:40:27.889
MATT: After the hit, Mozuu goes limp in your hand
and you're flailing him around in the grasp.

01:40:27.889 --> 01:40:35.610
The gravewalker takes the hit, looks up at
you. He's going to go ahead and make

01:40:35.610 --> 01:40:40.296
one strike with Urfael. That is 20.

01:40:40.296 --> 01:40:41.979
LAURA: Oh no! It hits me.

01:40:41.979 --> 01:40:47.461
MATT: All right, you take eight points of slashing
damage. And that is a 22 to hit.

01:40:47.461 --> 01:40:49.368
LAURA: Oh god. It gets me.

01:40:49.368 --> 01:40:51.638
MATT: You take 12 points of slashing damage.

01:40:51.638 --> 01:40:55.130
LAURA: Oh no! I'm unconscious!

01:40:55.130 --> 01:41:02.415
MATT: You're unconscious? All right, as you fall
unconscious and collapse to the ground, he reaches

01:41:02.415 --> 01:41:07.641
down and grasps the side of your face and you feel
this urge of energy come up from underneath and as

01:41:07.641 --> 01:41:12.451
your eyes flare open, you see the burning, vibrant
eyes of the wraith within the gravewalker say,

01:41:12.451 --> 01:41:20.819
"Stand and join me." Do you want to resist or not?
Make a will save to resist, if you want.

01:41:20.819 --> 01:41:22.359
LAURA: I'm going to try and resist it.

01:41:22.359 --> 01:41:26.620
MATT: Make a wisdom saving throw.

01:41:26.620 --> 01:41:28.732
LAURA: Oh shit! 19.

01:41:28.732 --> 01:41:34.635
MATT: And you do. Brought back to the brink, there
the gravewalker stands ahead of you. As you

01:41:34.635 --> 01:41:43.182
resist, he goes, "Fine. I gave you a choice."
Spins the blade around and takes you out from that point.

01:41:43.182 --> 01:41:44.976
SAM: Is she dead?

01:41:44.976 --> 01:41:46.081
MATT: Yeah.

01:41:46.081 --> 01:41:46.931
SAM: Dead dead?

01:41:46.931 --> 01:41:48.314
TRAVIS: Yep. Dead.

01:41:48.314 --> 01:41:53.776
LAURA: I didn't get turnt! And it was worth it!

01:41:53.776 --> 01:41:56.830
MATT: Skak, your turn, up on the edge of the
wall.

01:41:56.830 --> 01:42:02.146
TRAVIS: Can I try and resist the domination? That
I'm under the hold?

01:42:02.146 --> 01:42:03.281
MATT: No.

01:42:03.281 --> 01:42:11.486
TRAVIS: No. Then I will gladly take a-- can I jump
down from the wall? No, crossbow. Is he within

01:42:11.486 --> 01:42:13.828
melee of anybody for sneak attack?

01:42:13.828 --> 01:42:18.504
MATT: Actually, yeah. He would have been in melee
with her, which means he's right next to Talion.

01:42:18.504 --> 01:42:20.631
So, yeah.

01:42:20.631 --> 01:42:22.426
TRAVIS: All right. Crossbow right at him.

01:42:22.426 --> 01:42:25.056
SAM: I don't think I have another resistance to
this this time, I mean, is it cycled through

01:42:25.056 --> 01:42:26.030
again?

01:42:26.030 --> 01:42:28.035
MATT: It would be because you've gone since last
time.

01:42:28.035 --> 01:42:29.563
TRAVIS: With my bonus, can I try and hide?

01:42:29.563 --> 01:42:31.712
MATT: You may.

01:42:31.712 --> 01:42:32.892
TRAVIS: That's 26.

01:42:32.892 --> 01:42:34.339
MATT: Make a perception check.

01:42:34.339 --> 01:42:35.992
SAM: It's not good. It's like eight.

01:42:35.992 --> 01:42:37.032
MATT: All right.

01:42:37.032 --> 01:42:39.196
TRAVIS: How do I get advantage on the rolls? Sneak
attack?

01:42:39.196 --> 01:42:43.540
MATT: Well, you do now that he doesn't see you.

01:42:43.540 --> 01:42:46.563
TRAVIS: Okay great, come on. Damn it! Okay, that's
fine. 18.

01:42:46.563 --> 01:42:48.183
MATT: 18 hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

01:42:48.183 --> 01:42:55.277
TRAVIS: Aw. 12, 15, 20.

01:42:55.277 --> 01:43:01.092
SAM: I resist 18 points of damage.

01:43:01.092 --> 01:43:02.566
TRAVIS: Damn it!

01:43:02.566 --> 01:43:09.232
But the tip goes into your chin.

01:43:09.232 --> 01:43:12.892
MATT: Oh my god. That's so great. I love it. I
love it so much.

01:43:12.892 --> 01:43:16.647
TRAVIS: Dang it, Eden! Just take it! Take the
arrow!

01:43:16.647 --> 01:43:20.261
SAM: I'm making a nice collection of your arrows.

01:43:20.261 --> 01:43:23.905
TRAVIS: Throw it at the Bright Lord!

01:43:23.905 --> 01:43:25.545
MATT: All right, that ends your turn, Skak.

01:43:25.545 --> 01:43:26.579
TRAVIS: Yes.

01:43:26.579 --> 01:43:28.109
MATT: Mozuu's unconscious.

01:43:28.109 --> 01:43:29.370
DARIN: Mozuu's dead.

01:43:29.370 --> 01:43:32.012
MATT: Mozuu's pretty gone. Eden, you're up.

01:43:32.012 --> 01:43:39.643
SAM: Yes. All right, Bright Lord, let's see what
you got! Hi-ya!

01:43:39.643 --> 01:43:42.571
LAURA: Shrak is flinging everywhere.

01:43:42.571 --> 01:43:46.341
MATT: Yeah. All across.

01:43:46.341 --> 01:43:57.093
SAM: 13! Ugh! Nine!

01:43:57.093 --> 01:44:06.542
Bonus action! Oh! 18 plus seven, that's 25!

01:44:06.542 --> 01:44:11.258
MATT: That hits. Go ahead and roll a d6 plus
damage.

01:44:11.258 --> 01:44:17.932
SAM: Oh, you've got a mark on your face from my
hand! Oh, it's a poo mark!

01:44:17.932 --> 01:44:25.716
That's the mark of the shrak! The shrak lord!
One!

01:44:25.716 --> 01:44:27.456
MATT: Plus?

01:44:27.456 --> 01:44:28.631
SAM: Plus four, I guess?

01:44:28.631 --> 01:44:35.303
MATT: All right, so five damage. He's going to use
a legendary action at the end of your turn to do

01:44:35.303 --> 01:44:42.681
dominate on you. He goes, "One mark for another,
uruk brother." Reaches forward to grasp at you.

01:44:42.681 --> 01:44:47.294
Natural 20. Make a wisdom saving throw.

01:44:47.294 --> 01:44:48.753
SAM: I mean, you got a 20!

01:44:48.753 --> 01:44:52.860
MATT: I'll say disadvantage on the wisdom saving
throw, because of the natural 20.

01:44:52.860 --> 01:44:54.629
SAM: Yeah. So seven?

01:44:54.629 --> 01:45:00.947
MATT: As the brand of the gravewalker burns into
your face, suddenly you see now the vision of

01:45:00.947 --> 01:45:06.455
glory, the possible downfall of the Dark Lord and
a new beginning under the Bright Lord here in

01:45:06.455 --> 01:45:13.273
Mordor. And as he pulls the hand away, now the
fray has come to a calm. The villains and the

01:45:13.273 --> 01:45:19.314
current scenario from there and now, your
perspective now ended. The rest of the uruk begin

01:45:19.314 --> 01:45:25.799
to gather around. Face-eater Ur-Gram comes up
behind and the gravewalker looks about to invite

01:45:25.799 --> 01:45:35.254
those that survived the fray now under his grasp.
"Come. We must salvage the shreds. I mean to carve

01:45:35.254 --> 01:45:41.364
"my way northwest." You watch now as a red-orange
flare off in the distance up in the clouds

01:45:41.364 --> 01:45:49.484
signifies the volcanic explosion within Mount Doom
far, far away. "Stand at my side, orcs. For we

01:45:49.484 --> 01:45:58.372
"march on Barad-dűr. The time of the Dark Lord
wanes in the wake of the Bright Lord's wrath."

01:45:58.372 --> 01:46:00.282
And that's where we're going to end it tonight.

01:46:00.282 --> 01:46:03.065
(cheering)

01:46:03.065 --> 01:46:04.453
LAURA: That was awesome!

01:46:04.453 --> 01:46:05.864
MATT: Well done, guys!

01:46:05.864 --> 01:46:08.004
TRAVIS: That was fun!

01:46:08.004 --> 01:46:10.006
LAURA: I died!

01:46:10.006 --> 01:46:16.568
TRAVIS: I want you to know that after that ended,
I went up and shot Eden in his sleep. To rise

01:46:16.568 --> 01:46:19.575
through the ranks.

01:46:19.575 --> 01:46:20.607
MATT: And there you have it.

01:46:20.607 --> 01:46:21.714
TRAVIS: My warchief ambitions.

01:46:21.714 --> 01:46:25.376
DARIN: Well, we tried to hit every angle of the
orcs in the game.

01:46:25.376 --> 01:46:26.899
LAURA: That was so fun!

01:46:26.899 --> 01:46:29.811
MATT: That was great. Guys, well done. That was a
blast.

01:46:29.811 --> 01:46:38.659
SAM: But not as fun as the game that's coming out
on October 10. It's called "Mordor, Mordor, Mordor."

01:46:38.659 --> 01:46:40.317
DARIN: No it is not!

01:46:40.317 --> 01:46:51.321
MATT: Shadow of War, coming out October 10. Also
out on iOS and for Android. WB Games, thank you so

01:46:51.321 --> 01:46:54.692
much for making this happen. We had a blast. Hope
you guys had a good time.

01:46:54.692 --> 01:46:58.389
TRAVIS: That shadow strike is real in the game,
too. It's legit.

01:46:58.389 --> 01:47:03.379
MATT: All right. Well, have a wonderful day. And
is it Thursday yet? Bye.

01:47:03.379 --> 01:47:11.317
