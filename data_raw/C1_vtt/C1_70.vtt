00:00:00.457 --> 00:00:03.948
MATT: Hello, everyone, and welcome to tonight's
episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us

00:00:03.948 --> 00:00:09.685
nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play
Dungeons and Dragons. Tonight, picking up from a

00:00:09.685 --> 00:00:14.615
crazy episode last week, we have Percy among us
still.

00:00:14.615 --> 00:00:19.580
TALIESIN: Hi! Ugh, my product!

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:25.511
MATT: We'll get through a few announcements. One,
apparently this is the night where we all wear the

00:00:25.511 --> 00:00:31.740
same shirt, because that happened. Also, three of
us may have gone to a CHVRCHES concert on Monday

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:37.978
and are obsessed with them, so there's that.
Anyway. Let's jump in here. First and foremost,

00:00:37.978 --> 00:00:42.436
tonight is our fantastic sponsor returning as
often as they do and thank you so much, Loot Crate!

00:00:42.436 --> 00:00:44.808
(cheering)

00:00:44.808 --> 00:00:50.754
SAM: Loot Crate. The theme of this month is
horror. I've been dabbling in the hip-hop world

00:00:50.754 --> 00:00:58.391
lately, so I prepared a little rap. It's pretty
street, guys.

00:00:58.391 --> 00:01:03.034
LAURA: Oh no! No, you are not doing that right
now!

00:01:03.034 --> 00:01:08.653
SAM: It's going to be pretty hardcore, so buckle
up. Maestro, I need a track.

00:01:08.653 --> 00:01:13.841
[hip-hop music]

00:01:13.841 --> 00:01:22.104
SAM: A little louder. Got to feel a jam here. My
name is MC Sammy, and I'm here to say, I love Loot

00:01:22.104 --> 00:01:28.873
Crate in a major way. Their boxes are fly and full
of loot. You'll feel real dope and that's no bull

00:01:28.873 --> 00:01:37.952
shoot! Yeah! (record scratch) I'm funky fresh, a
real hip-hopper and we got a discount to save you

00:01:37.952 --> 00:01:44.000
some copper. If you use our code you can save
three bucks! And if you don't, I don't give a fu--

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.599
beatbox break down. (beat boxing)

00:01:47.599 --> 00:01:50.138
(laughter)

00:01:50.138 --> 00:01:52.873
SAM: There's more.

00:01:52.873 --> 00:01:54.845
TRAVIS: I have the hiccups!

00:01:54.845 --> 00:01:59.098
SAM: So in conclus-- oh.

00:01:59.098 --> 00:02:03.548
(laughter)

00:02:03.548 --> 00:02:14.529
SAM: So in conclusion, listen up, G, I'm down with
Loot Crate and with OPP. Their swag is the bomb,

00:02:14.529 --> 00:02:19.236
and their threads rocks. You want horror? It's in
the box! Word!

00:02:19.236 --> 00:02:22.523
LAURA: Wow!

00:02:22.523 --> 00:02:25.513
MATT: Thank you, Sam!

00:02:25.513 --> 00:02:26.499
SAM: Sure.

00:02:26.499 --> 00:02:27.942
LAURA: That made me sweat.

00:02:27.942 --> 00:02:32.166
SAM: Man. That went really well.

00:02:32.166 --> 00:02:36.993
MATT: That did not at all send hip-hop back to
1991.

00:02:36.993 --> 00:02:41.855
MARISHA: I think I saw that in my D.A.R.E. class.

00:02:41.855 --> 00:02:47.009
(laughter)

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:54.483
MATT: Thank you, Loot Crate, for allowing us, week
after week, to have Sam do this. Thank you. Thank

00:02:54.483 --> 00:02:55.653
you, Sam.

00:02:55.653 --> 00:03:00.949
SAM: Also, lootcrate.com/criticalrole now goes to
a custom Critical Role page within lootcrate.com,

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:04.752
and you should check it out. Love you all. Word to
your mama.

00:03:04.752 --> 00:03:07.599
(laughter)

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:11.959
MATT: All righty! Next up on the list.

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:13.698
LIAM: I knew this episode would start in tears.

00:03:13.698 --> 00:03:15.899
(laughter)

00:03:15.899 --> 00:03:20.845
MATT: It hasn't even started yet! Laura, do you
want to talk about merch stuff coming up here?

00:03:20.845 --> 00:03:22.321
LAURA: Merch stuff coming up?

00:03:22.321 --> 00:03:24.754
MATT: Preorders are still going?

00:03:24.754 --> 00:03:28.619
LAURA: Yeah, preorders for the hoodies are still
going on, aren't they? How about that, guys?

00:03:28.619 --> 00:03:34.958
They're still happening. You can still order those
for I think a whole other week. No? Am I wrong?

00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:38.231
I'm stroking out so hard. For another week!

00:03:38.231 --> 00:03:43.117
MARISHA: Continuing the 1991 trend.

00:03:43.117 --> 00:03:50.531
MATT: All right. The next thing we want to
mention, as 'tis the season of Halloween, we are

00:03:50.531 --> 00:03:54.457
announcing tonight, leading up to the end of the
month, we're having a Critical Role Halloween

00:03:54.457 --> 00:04:01.343
costume contest. If any of you guys are dressing
up as anything Critical Role related whatsoever,

00:04:01.343 --> 00:04:06.700
go ahead and tweet it at us or Instagram it at us
with the hashtag #CriticalCostumes. Together, one

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:12.007
word. #CriticalCostumes. We'll have a winner and a
runner-up. Prizes are to be determined. Sam is

00:04:12.007 --> 00:04:15.221
dead-set on giving away a bunch of his old shirts.
That might be one of them. We'll figure it out.

00:04:15.221 --> 00:04:16.985
TALIESIN: It's going to be a Halloween treat.

00:04:16.985 --> 00:04:19.599
LAURA: We don't know what we're doing yet.

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:23.540
MARISHA: No. I also didn't tell Geek and Sundry we
were doing this.

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:28.090
MATT: This isn't a Geek and Sundry contest. This is
our contest. We are doing this with you guys.

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:33.866
We'll be figuring out prizes. Yeah.
#CriticalCostumes. You'll have to the end of the

00:04:33.866 --> 00:04:38.817
month up until Halloween proper. We shall
determine a winner and runner-up. Excited to see

00:04:38.817 --> 00:04:40.298
what you guys do.

00:04:40.298 --> 00:04:46.008
Laura and Travis, you want to talk about another
episode of another project you guys are working on?

00:04:46.008 --> 00:04:51.850
TRAVIS: I will! We're both in Telltale's the
Batman series, which is great. Laura plays

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:57.728
Catwoman. I play Harvey Dent. Episode two released
last week or the week before. I think it was last

00:04:57.728 --> 00:05:02.905
week. It's really great. It's on major consoles,
PS4, Xbox One. You can get it on your phone now,

00:05:02.905 --> 00:05:11.781
too, so check it out and watch us be a part of the
Batman rogues' gallery. Yeah. And save Harvey Dent.

00:05:11.824 --> 00:05:14.875
Don't worry about Catwoman. She's a piece of cat
poop.

00:05:14.875 --> 00:05:16.547
MATT: There you have it.

00:05:16.547 --> 00:05:18.699
LIAM: That's a line straight from the game!

00:05:18.699 --> 00:05:21.207
TRAVIS: You can look forward to that kind of
writing.

00:05:21.263 --> 00:05:28.673
LAURA: In addition, though, to Batman: The
Telltale Series, Gears of War is launching on the

00:05:28.673 --> 00:05:35.383
11th. We just did a big live event yesterday.
Gears of War 4. If you got the Ultimate Edition,

00:05:35.383 --> 00:05:39.631
you can download it and you can play it early. As
in, tonight. Which, you shouldn't do. You should

00:05:39.631 --> 00:05:42.650
be watching us. But you could do it after you're
done watching us.

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:45.434
TRAVIS: It's pretty sweet. I played it a bunch.
It's really great.

00:05:45.434 --> 00:05:46.847
MATT: That's fantastic.

00:05:46.847 --> 00:05:47.803
MARISHA and TALIESIN: War harder.

00:05:47.803 --> 00:05:55.460
MATT: Other couple of announcements. Really
amazing isometric RPG that me and few of you guys

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:57.683
have worked on. Liam, you worked on it. Sam, did
you work on Masquerada?

00:05:57.683 --> 00:05:58.643
SAM: Which?

00:05:58.643 --> 00:05:59.776
MATT: Masquerada?

00:05:59.776 --> 00:06:00.525
SAM: Nope!

00:06:00.525 --> 00:06:05.503
MATT: Nope! Me and Liam worked on Masquerada. It
came out last week on Steam, and I believe it will

00:06:05.503 --> 00:06:11.053
be available on consoles later in the year. It's a
great story, incredibly well-written, fantastic cast.

00:06:11.053 --> 00:06:13.315
LIAM: Matt is very fancy in it.

00:06:13.315 --> 00:06:20.218
MATT: Yes! I highly recommend it. I'm really proud
of the game. If you like really good narrative

00:06:20.218 --> 00:06:24.829
stories and great character development, I highly
recommend it. Check out Masquerada on Steam.

00:06:24.829 --> 00:06:28.542
Coming up towards the end of this month, too,
Titanfall 2.

00:06:28.542 --> 00:06:31.910
LAURA: Your trailer looks so good!

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:39.987
MATT: I play the protagonist in the single-player
mode. You should check it out. You get to have a

00:06:39.987 --> 00:06:45.788
fun buddy cop experience with me and your titan.
Check that out in a few weeks, guys.

00:06:45.788 --> 00:06:50.910
LIAM: That's all I'm allowed to say. I also play a
guy. Yeah. Okay. That's it.

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:53.982
LAURA: That's as far it gets right now.

00:06:53.982 --> 00:06:57.004
TRAVIS: We're basically in all the video games,
you guys.

00:06:57.004 --> 00:06:59.073
SAM: I'm not in that one, apparently.

00:06:59.073 --> 00:07:00.584
TALIESIN: Apparently not.

00:07:00.584 --> 00:07:12.953
SAM: Yeah, well, Matt, are you in Blue Robot 13?
Yeah. Are you in Verdant Lightning? Yeah.

00:07:12.953 --> 00:07:14.374
LAURA: Are those real games?

00:07:14.374 --> 00:07:15.616
SAM: No, they're not real.

00:07:15.616 --> 00:07:20.569
TALIESIN: They could've been, though. I was
nodding like, yeah, Verdant Lightning. I have that.

00:07:20.569 --> 00:07:26.358
MATT: Couple of other quick announcements. Me and
Taliesin, not this weekend but the weekend after,

00:07:26.358 --> 00:07:31.426
will be in New Hampshire at Another Anime Con.
We'll be doing panels and signings and fun stuff

00:07:31.426 --> 00:07:37.473
there. Those of you guys in that vicinity, come
say hello to us. Bring things and books to sign

00:07:37.473 --> 00:07:42.620
and bring questions for our panels, because we
will be lonely otherwise. (German accent) And it

00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:47.957
would be a great time to meet you, and make your
way to Another Anime Convention. We'll see you there.

00:07:47.957 --> 00:07:50.115
TALIESIN: (German accent) We'll be doing these
accents--

00:07:50.115 --> 00:07:52.348
SAM: That's your New Hampshire accent?

00:07:52.348 --> 00:07:56.639
MATT: (German accent) That's what they sound like
in New Hampshire, is that correct? (normal voice)

00:07:56.639 --> 00:08:01.588
Last but not least, guys, please don't forget to
vote.

00:08:01.588 --> 00:08:03.583
TALIESIN: Register!

00:08:03.583 --> 00:08:05.575
LAURA: Register to vote! You've still got some
time.

00:08:05.575 --> 00:08:07.095
MARISHA: And then vote.

00:08:07.095 --> 00:08:10.916
MATT: Deadlines for most states are coming up
pretty soon. California has until October 24th as

00:08:10.916 --> 00:08:17.098
the deadline to register. Please register so you
can go out and vote. It's so important, you guys.

00:08:17.098 --> 00:08:23.098
Oh my god. Seriously, we're living in an Orwellian
fantasy right now. Please vote.

00:08:23.098 --> 00:08:26.557
MARISHA: We'll be there, waiting in lines at
public schools just like everybody else.

00:08:26.557 --> 00:08:31.004
TRAVIS: Yeah, we're going to come to the line that
you would go to if you vote because we know which

00:08:31.004 --> 00:08:34.786
ones you're going to be at. We'll shake your hand.
We're going to be there for each one of you.

00:08:34.786 --> 00:08:37.367
Individually. Like Santa Claus.

00:08:37.367 --> 00:08:40.386
MATT: Travis will be there at each individual one
at the speed of light.

00:08:40.386 --> 00:08:43.444
TALIESIN: My voting center actually has a tank out
front that's a National Guard center that we play

00:08:43.444 --> 00:08:47.196
on the tank. There'll be a picture of me with a
tank later.

00:08:47.196 --> 00:08:48.121
MARISHA: That's cool!

00:08:48.121 --> 00:08:49.541
TALIESIN: Yeah, it's nice.

00:08:49.541 --> 00:08:56.179
MATT: Unless we have any other announcements, I
think it's time to bring us down to tonight's

00:08:56.179 --> 00:08:58.799
episode of Critical Role.

00:08:58.799 --> 00:10:34.860
[dramatic music]

00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:40.932
MATT: Hello, and welcome back. So! Picking up
where we last left off. Vox Machina, our band of

00:10:40.932 --> 00:10:45.050
adventurers, had been collecting the Vestiges of
Divergence, a series of artifacts to prepare for

00:10:45.050 --> 00:10:49.985
their coming encounter with Thordak the Cinder
King and the rest of the Chroma Conclave, a group

00:10:49.985 --> 00:10:55.241
of evil, ancient dragons that banded together to
tear across and dominate the Tal'Dorei

00:10:55.241 --> 00:10:56.289
countryside.

00:10:56.289 --> 00:11:03.186
During their most recent journey, they were
tailing a competitive group searching for these

00:11:03.186 --> 00:11:08.924
same artifacts led by a forgotten villain of the
past known as Dr. Ripley. They were led into a

00:11:08.924 --> 00:11:13.540
trap, and a heavy battle took place, one that
claimed the life of Percival. The party retrieved

00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:20.790
his body, took it back to Whitestone, and through
a series of very lucky rolls and imploring his

00:11:20.790 --> 00:11:26.624
soul to return, once freeing it from the devouring
jaws of Orthax the shadow demon, he was restored

00:11:26.624 --> 00:11:27.716
to life.

00:11:27.716 --> 00:11:33.408
Celebration was short-lived thus far. After an
evening's rest, they were asked by their old ally,

00:11:33.408 --> 00:11:38.480
Seeker Asum, to meet them upstairs in Castle
Whitestone in the war room for a very important

00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:46.139
meeting. Upon arriving around the central table,
Asum revealed himself to actually be Raishan, the

00:11:46.139 --> 00:11:50.449
green dragon and member of the Chroma Conclave
that you had not seen since the original attack on

00:11:50.449 --> 00:11:58.647
Emon, and left you last with the bombshell and bit
of information that Raishan's here to make an

00:11:58.647 --> 00:12:05.289
alliance and as you are, as well, Raishan is
interested in the destruction and downfall of

00:12:05.289 --> 00:12:07.317
Thordak, the Cinder King.

00:12:07.317 --> 00:12:17.762
And that's where we're going to pick up. Having
just revealed through the somewhat transformed

00:12:17.762 --> 00:12:26.973
eyebrows, eyes, and upper face of the hairless,
tattooed and scarred side head of Seeker Asum, you

00:12:26.973 --> 00:12:31.620
can see the reptilian green scales billow out and
become glowing yellowish reptilian eyes peeking

00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:41.944
through. The voice modulates into more of a
deeper, but thin, reedy hiss after Asum looks to

00:12:41.944 --> 00:12:57.097
you all as Raishan and says, "I wish to kill the
Cinder King. Now, do you accept my alliance?"

00:12:57.097 --> 00:13:02.720
LAURA: That's it? We're just supposed to trust
you?

00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:07.535
MATT: "No! I assumed you'd ask questions. I'm an
open book. What do you require?"

00:13:07.535 --> 00:13:13.183
LIAM: Why in the fuck should we trust you?

00:13:13.183 --> 00:13:20.611
MATT: "You shouldn't, to be perfectly honest. I am
a being that rides the line between what's true

00:13:20.611 --> 00:13:28.580
"and what's false, and I know your research has
spoken the same. However, strange circumstances

00:13:28.580 --> 00:13:36.892
"make for strange bedfellows. And circumstances as
they are, I think you have very little choice, as

00:13:36.892 --> 00:13:38.479
"do I."

00:13:38.479 --> 00:13:40.572
LIAM: What do you claim your motives to be?

00:13:40.572 --> 00:13:48.412
MATT: "Listen for a moment, and I'll tell you a
bit about the history of this green dragon before you.

00:13:48.412 --> 00:13:57.873
"My home is south of here within the jungles of
the Rifenmist Peninsula along the southern side of

00:13:57.873 --> 00:14:05.476
"the Stormcrest. That is where I met the Cinder
King nearly two decades ago. He encroached upon my

00:14:05.476 --> 00:14:18.808
"territory. We battled then, an exhausting struggle
over days. Thordak is keen of eye, however, and

00:14:18.808 --> 00:14:30.399
"older than I. He held his assault. He saw me, and
he saw my disease.

00:14:30.399 --> 00:14:39.346
"I was cursed a half-century ago, when I
infiltrated and toppled a temple of Melora that

00:14:39.346 --> 00:14:46.356
"was being built by a high druid for her roving
peons. As I consumed her last follower, broke the

00:14:46.356 --> 00:14:54.968
"druid upon her altar, she gave her dying breath to
spite me. This sickness that she imparted was

00:14:54.968 --> 00:15:02.890
"merely an inconvenience, but as the years wore on,
it spread and worsened.

00:15:02.890 --> 00:15:11.355
"I left my pursuits of base interests and began to
obsess over a cure for this before it took me. I

00:15:11.355 --> 00:15:19.802
"burned through servant after servant to find
&lt;i&gt;anything&lt;/i&gt; on such a disease. Everything failed.

00:15:19.802 --> 00:15:23.210
"&lt;i&gt;Everything.&lt;/i&gt;

00:15:23.210 --> 00:15:37.986
"Thordak somehow noted and recognized my ailment.
He said, 'You are unwell. A rare malady upon you.

00:15:37.986 --> 00:15:49.159
"'It will claim you, in time. However, I've traveled
the world, I've gathered many secrets, and I know

00:15:49.159 --> 00:15:56.489
"'how to be rid of it. To burn it out of your
system with a fire you will never find. I've done

00:15:56.489 --> 00:16:02.616
"'it before. I can burn away the worst of
illnesses.'

00:16:02.616 --> 00:16:11.847
"Now, I am a creature that can pierce any lie by
nature. I know in my heart that he spoke the truth

00:16:11.847 --> 00:16:26.109
"that day, that dragon. When asked what he wanted
in return, he said, 'Your servitude.' We made an

00:16:26.109 --> 00:16:32.674
"agreement. He would return once he marked his
domain. We discussed the terms.

00:16:32.674 --> 00:16:43.193
"However, he did not return. I grew furious and
sought answers only to find that he was brought

00:16:43.193 --> 00:16:54.614
"low and sealed away by some assembled others, some
fools from Emon. It took me years of seeking, but

00:16:54.614 --> 00:17:00.419
"I found his whereabouts. I was not going to let my
chance to strike away this bloody curse slip from

00:17:00.419 --> 00:17:11.282
"me, so I met him on the fire plane. Over the
years, I saw his swelling, his pained form. He

00:17:11.282 --> 00:17:16.763
"spoke of plans, ideas for vengeance and
domination, but he would not relinquish the

00:17:16.763 --> 00:17:20.140
"secrets he promised me until I released him.

00:17:20.140 --> 00:17:27.940
"I proposed the Conclave. I assembled the others.
I negotiated the agreements. I corrupted the

00:17:27.940 --> 00:17:32.428
"binding stone. I prepared the Pyrah gate. I did
&lt;i&gt;everything&lt;/i&gt;!

00:17:32.428 --> 00:17:43.901
"As time went on, Thordak's clarity muddled. It
seemed his bindings, the power that he was

00:17:43.901 --> 00:17:51.814
"absorbing, was beginning to drive him mad, so we
did not have any more time. I needed to initiate

00:17:51.814 --> 00:17:57.677
"the escape before he lost enough to forget our
agreement, the means to even fulfill his side of

00:17:57.677 --> 00:18:07.080
"the bargain. No celestial solstice as planned, but
Winter's Crest would have to do. And with Thordak

00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:14.600
"freed, the Conclave assembled, Tal'Dorei was
razed, divided, and won.

00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:26.165
"But Thordak still withheld his words. He laughs
at my requests. I see now that he does not mean to

00:18:26.165 --> 00:18:35.374
"tell me, and never really did, as his mind began
to go. He enjoys his seat of power over all of

00:18:35.374 --> 00:18:46.774
"you, over me. I want him &lt;i&gt;dead&lt;/i&gt;! I want to watch
him be torn apart, I want to see his eyes go cold

00:18:46.774 --> 00:18:54.576
"and in that very moment, I want to call his spirit
back and bind his word to tell me how I can save

00:18:54.576 --> 00:19:00.190
"myself. And then laugh at his misfortune as I tear
what's left of him.

00:19:00.190 --> 00:19:15.616
"&lt;i&gt;That&lt;/i&gt; is why I come to you. I have not the power
to take him myself."

00:19:15.616 --> 00:19:27.705
MARISHA: Thordak will experience all of those
things. He will burn and he will suffer and you

00:19:27.705 --> 00:19:30.943
will not be there to watch it happen.

00:19:30.943 --> 00:19:34.657
LAURA: Keyleth?

00:19:34.657 --> 00:19:46.595
MARISHA: You want to feel the burning inside of
you? Oh, you will feel it, Raishan. But it will

00:19:46.595 --> 00:19:58.900
not be from Thordak or whatever proposed cure he
made up. The burning you feel will be from the

00:19:58.900 --> 00:20:14.282
souls of ten thousand Fire Ashari as they sear your
flesh, and the last thing that you will see will

00:20:14.282 --> 00:20:27.447
be &lt;i&gt;my&lt;/i&gt; face as I watch you suffer, as you watched
a quarter of my civilization burn!

00:20:27.447 --> 00:20:40.728
MATT: "Child, I commend your bravery in the face
of certain doom, but think before you give in to

00:20:40.728 --> 00:20:47.664
"such base passions. There is much to be gained by
us working together, and so much more to be lost."

00:20:47.664 --> 00:20:54.984
MARISHA: Oh, you commend me for bravery? Oh,
Raishan, for someone who is supposed to be so

00:20:54.984 --> 00:21:09.566
smart-- I am not afraid! I know what you are. You
are a parasite. You walk around calling yourself a

00:21:09.566 --> 00:21:20.118
magnificent ancient dragon. You are nothing more
than a leech. You consumed the energy of my people

00:21:20.118 --> 00:21:27.459
for years! And we're supposed to just trust you?

00:21:27.459 --> 00:21:28.905
MATT: "Child, your anger is misplaced--"

00:21:28.905 --> 00:21:31.277
MARISHA: (shouting) Call me child one more goddamn
time!

00:21:31.277 --> 00:21:33.234
TRAVIS: I move behind Keyleth.

00:21:33.234 --> 00:21:43.043
MATT: "I did not slay a single one of your people.
Thordak's release destroyed the top of that

00:21:43.043 --> 00:21:44.086
"mountain--"

00:21:44.086 --> 00:21:51.170
MARISHA: (shouting) Which you did! You unleashed
the mad dog, you bitch! This is your fucking

00:21:51.170 --> 00:22:09.969
fault! (quieter) He's just a mad king. As you said
so yourself, you're the master planner! But your

00:22:09.969 --> 00:22:20.345
plan backfired, didn't it? So now you've come to
us, and you think that you can formulate some

00:22:20.345 --> 00:22:29.551
other master plan that's still going to somehow
get you what you want! You dumb fool. When will

00:22:29.551 --> 00:22:31.662
you fucking learn?

00:22:31.662 --> 00:22:37.981
MATT: "Keyleth."

00:22:37.981 --> 00:22:40.524
MARISHA: Raishan.

00:22:40.524 --> 00:22:55.168
MATT: "Do not mistake my grace in this room for
need of conflict, nor foolhardy wishes. If I

00:22:55.168 --> 00:22:59.697
"wanted each one of you dead, I would be chewing on
your bones right now."

00:22:59.697 --> 00:23:19.607
TALIESIN: I think, perhaps, if I may be so bold as
to tidy up what Keyleth is trying to drive home

00:23:19.607 --> 00:23:31.012
here, is that for all intents and purposes from
this side of the table, you strike me as a

00:23:31.012 --> 00:23:37.638
desperate creature who's pretending that he has a
choice to be here and has brought-- she, excuse

00:23:37.638 --> 00:23:46.655
me. That is another conversation. You've brought
very little to the table. We are not impressed

00:23:46.655 --> 00:23:52.316
with your notions that somehow we can work
together. You need us, and this is all you bring?

00:23:52.316 --> 00:23:54.868
MATT: "I bring information--"

00:23:54.868 --> 00:23:56.322
TALIESIN: (scoffs)

00:23:56.322 --> 00:23:58.042
MATT: "I bring knowledge of Thordak--"

00:23:58.042 --> 00:23:59.360
TALIESIN: Where is Asum?

00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:02.005
MATT: "I know where Asum is--"

00:24:02.005 --> 00:24:03.465
TALIESIN: Where is Asum?

00:24:03.465 --> 00:24:04.698
LIAM: Let's start with that.

00:24:04.698 --> 00:24:07.843
TALIESIN: Let's stop pretending you have a choice
here.

00:24:07.843 --> 00:24:20.717
MATT: "The one you call Seeker Asum is alive, in
Emon, still working amongst the Clasp. The story I

00:24:20.717 --> 00:24:28.992
"gave you was mostly truth, peppered with necessary
deceit to place me here amongst you for the time I

00:24:28.992 --> 00:24:33.818
"needed. He is there to secure survivors against
Thordak.

00:24:33.818 --> 00:24:41.634
"I infiltrated the ranks of the Clasp, gained his
trust, which allowed me to find your whereabouts,

00:24:41.634 --> 00:24:49.289
"and so I came. He sent me on a mission to notify
you of his plans, which, by the way, along with

00:24:49.289 --> 00:24:56.722
"Brotoras, Goldhand, and the Clasp's cooperation,
they have a plan to strike at the Cinder King."

00:24:56.722 --> 00:25:10.866
LIAM: Insight check. Well, hold on. No. 13. Never
mind.

00:25:10.866 --> 00:25:13.055
MATT: Slippery dragon.

00:25:13.055 --> 00:25:15.022
(laughter)

00:25:15.022 --> 00:25:18.690
MATT: There's no reason for you to believe or
disbelieve. It's just words to you right now.

00:25:18.690 --> 00:25:20.311
LIAM: Yeah.

00:25:20.311 --> 00:25:25.841
LAURA: What's their plan?

00:25:25.841 --> 00:25:35.702
MATT: "One that'll fail, of course. You see, they
put their knowledge in what a red dragon is

00:25:35.702 --> 00:25:42.719
"capable of. They believe that by quelling the
flames or stoking some nature of the crystal in

00:25:42.719 --> 00:25:48.069
"its belly's magic, there would be a way to stop
him. And there is a path to be taken there, yes,

00:25:48.069 --> 00:25:54.517
"but their knowledge is faulty. They don't
understand the nature of the enchantment, and

00:25:54.517 --> 00:25:58.902
"should they attack, they will burn in the flames
of their own righteousness."

00:25:58.902 --> 00:26:02.355
LAURA: What's your illness?

00:26:02.355 --> 00:26:14.726
MATT: "I wish I knew the extent of it--" And you
watch as Asum's form grows a little more green in

00:26:14.726 --> 00:26:20.595
places, the scales unfolding, and as the image,
though still in the halfling form, where the

00:26:20.595 --> 00:26:25.517
scales rest you can see a series of deep,
purplish-black veins that ride up the side of the

00:26:25.517 --> 00:26:38.267
throat, and across the chest and the arms, and
they pulse with each heartbeat. "It withers my

00:26:38.267 --> 00:26:50.605
"constitution. It makes me weary. I've sat with
this for nearly a hundred years. My brain is not

00:26:50.605 --> 00:26:56.741
"dull, but I wish not to have this brilliant
intellect waste away into ash because I couldn't

00:26:56.741 --> 00:26:58.427
"find an answer."

00:26:58.427 --> 00:27:00.487
LAURA: So you come before us and you tell us
you're weak?

00:27:00.487 --> 00:27:03.397
MATT: "Well, weak by my standards."

00:27:03.397 --> 00:27:06.556
MARISHA: You're weak by mine, too.

00:27:06.556 --> 00:27:13.647
LIAM: &lt;i&gt;If&lt;/i&gt; we were to work with you, and that is a
massive fucking if, if we were to work with you

00:27:13.647 --> 00:27:21.357
and Thordak were to fall-- Paint us a picture,
what can we look forward to after that? What

00:27:21.357 --> 00:27:24.517
happens to you, where do you go, what happens to
Tal'Dorei?

00:27:24.517 --> 00:27:31.801
MATT: "I have no interest in this mass domination.
Most of these petty creatures that you call your

00:27:31.801 --> 00:27:37.386
"brethren, they live amongst their cities, and
that's fine. My happiness lies in returning to my

00:27:37.386 --> 00:27:43.478
"home in the Rifenmist, where I can pillage the
eastern and southern coasts. Or I can ride out

00:27:43.478 --> 00:27:50.717
"amongst the Viridian Ocean and steal what is
necessary to survive and enjoy my network of

00:27:50.717 --> 00:27:54.173
"followers and spies. Far away from where you
live."

00:27:54.173 --> 00:27:59.177
LIAM: You might as well be feeding us nursery
rhymes.

00:27:59.177 --> 00:28:02.796
MARISHA: Sounds like a life happily ever after.

00:28:02.796 --> 00:28:10.657
MATT: "If you're uncomfortable with my proximity,
post the fall of the king, I will happily take my

00:28:10.657 --> 00:28:17.274
"presence elsewhere. Gather my people, my
belongings, and find a roost, somewhere across the

00:28:17.274 --> 00:28:18.907
"Ozmit perhaps."

00:28:18.907 --> 00:28:22.815
TALIESIN: I'm comfortable with that being a
conversation that happens later.

00:28:22.815 --> 00:28:25.369
LAURA: Well, obviously, but I don't believe
anything she says.

00:28:25.369 --> 00:28:30.249
TRAVIS: You're sure that Thordak has a cure for
you?

00:28:30.249 --> 00:28:43.038
MATT: "I have spent many years trying to untangle
what could be the lie behind those eyes, and I am

00:28:43.038 --> 00:28:53.581
"certain. There is a confidence with knowing and
withholding. It is stronger than the strongest of

00:28:53.581 --> 00:29:03.652
"bluffs, and I've seen that confidence in the
Cinder King. A cruelty in that knowledge, that

00:29:03.652 --> 00:29:05.133
"smugness."

00:29:05.133 --> 00:29:09.619
LAURA: Is he still insane?

00:29:09.619 --> 00:29:21.661
MATT: "By most standards, has been for some time,
but it continues to slip. His narcissism grows to

00:29:21.661 --> 00:29:24.423
"dangerous bounds."

00:29:24.423 --> 00:29:28.837
TRAVIS: What about the white dragon?

00:29:28.837 --> 00:29:35.573
TALIESIN: Before we would consider any terms, we
would need the white dragon removed from the

00:29:35.573 --> 00:29:36.932
playing field.

00:29:36.932 --> 00:29:46.238
MARISHA: Could be a good way for you to show us
your loyalty, even though you have none. But know,

00:29:46.238 --> 00:30:03.541
Raishan, whatever deal we strike does not end in
you leaving my sight. You're going to die. You're

00:30:03.541 --> 00:30:08.334
going to die, even if I have to die doing it.

00:30:08.334 --> 00:30:12.511
MATT: "Amusing."

00:30:12.511 --> 00:30:20.756
TALIESIN: Really, this is a conversation about
whether or not we wait to try and kill you until

00:30:20.756 --> 00:30:27.154
before or after the Cinder King. That's fair, I
think.

00:30:27.154 --> 00:30:37.221
MATT: "You think that because you took surprise
upon Umbrasyl, the brute, his inferior intellect,

00:30:37.221 --> 00:30:45.648
"that you will have the opportunity to strike me
down? You have no idea what I'm capable of, no

00:30:45.648 --> 00:30:48.610
"matter what malady festers within me."

00:30:48.610 --> 00:30:53.214
TALIESIN: Oh, we know.

00:30:53.214 --> 00:30:55.736
MATT: "This is your home, right, Percival?"

00:30:55.736 --> 00:30:56.693
TALIESIN: It is.

00:30:56.693 --> 00:30:59.230
MATT: "It would be a shame for it to suddenly no
longer exist."

00:30:59.286 --> 00:31:01.347
MARISHA: Can we please just fucking kill her now?

00:31:01.347 --> 00:31:12.838
TALIESIN: I'm not Keyleth. Your threats, they
won't bend me, because I believe you. I believe

00:31:12.838 --> 00:31:19.521
that you would rend this entire city asunder.
That's why I'm at the table. I am conscious of

00:31:19.521 --> 00:31:30.706
where we are, I'm conscious of who you are, and
I'm conscious of what you need. I'm just trying to

00:31:30.706 --> 00:31:36.597
make sure that everybody's clear that the minute
that red dragon dies, all bets are off. You know

00:31:36.597 --> 00:31:45.404
it as well as I do. And you should be wary,
because only one side of this table is

00:31:45.404 --> 00:31:47.471
underestimating the other.

00:31:47.471 --> 00:31:52.234
TRAVIS: Which side is it?

00:31:52.234 --> 00:31:53.692
TALIESIN: Thank you, Grog.

00:31:53.692 --> 00:31:59.158
SAM: Can I do a perception check to make sure that
this being is actually in the room and is not just

00:31:59.158 --> 00:32:01.480
some sort of phantom?

00:32:01.480 --> 00:32:03.861
LAURA: We've seen this before.

00:32:03.861 --> 00:32:11.526
SAM: 17. Oh wait, am I proficient? No, 19.

00:32:11.526 --> 00:32:19.936
MATT: 19, okay. The entity you see before you does
appear to be physically present, to the best of

00:32:19.936 --> 00:32:24.609
your knowledge. No one's touched it or attempted
to, but it does seem to be present with you.

00:32:24.609 --> 00:32:31.563
TRAVIS: All right, I love a good story, so do you have
a plan?

00:32:31.563 --> 00:32:33.763
TALIESIN: One step at a time. White dragon.

00:32:33.763 --> 00:32:49.304
MATT: "Vorugal is a beast. Simple of mind. Eager
to kill, eat, sleep. That's about the extent. As

00:32:49.304 --> 00:32:53.541
"long as it's given enough land and cattle to
devour, it seems happy. It enjoys the hunt; it

00:32:53.541 --> 00:32:55.541
"enjoys the challenge."

00:32:55.541 --> 00:32:57.820
TALIESIN: How willing do you feel to be a
participant in his demise?

00:32:57.820 --> 00:33:02.046
LIAM: A lot better if you'd be willing to shed a
bit of blood.

00:33:02.046 --> 00:33:05.108
TALIESIN: Get your hands dirty.

00:33:05.108 --> 00:33:11.206
MARISHA: Oh, she's already done that.

00:33:11.206 --> 00:33:22.609
MATT: "Our agreement, should this go forward, does
not end when the Cinder King dies. I demand the

00:33:22.609 --> 00:33:26.262
"opportunity to converse with the spirit from the
corpse.

00:33:26.262 --> 00:33:46.626
"Once that's done, then you may pull your rug out
from under me, if you will. I wish you the best of luck."

00:33:46.626 --> 00:33:51.980
TALIESIN: Well, I assume once he's dead, either
you'll turn on us or you'll run away. Either way

00:33:51.980 --> 00:33:53.816
works for me.

00:33:53.816 --> 00:33:56.425
LIAM: Yeah, we're getting a bit ahead of
ourselves. Are you going to scrap with the white

00:33:56.425 --> 00:33:57.977
dragon with us or not?

00:33:57.977 --> 00:34:02.913
LAURA: Can you talk him into flying off, leaving
everyone alone?

00:34:02.913 --> 00:34:06.236
TALIESIN: No, I want a dead dragon.

00:34:06.236 --> 00:34:16.053
MATT: "You see, whereas I have the aptitude to
know where my alliances stand, Vorugal is, of the

00:34:16.053 --> 00:34:18.368
"entire Conclave, the closest Thordak has to a lap
dog."

00:34:18.368 --> 00:34:20.440
LAURA: So dead, then.

00:34:20.440 --> 00:34:22.702
MATT: "Probably the best bet, yes."

00:34:22.702 --> 00:34:26.375
TALIESIN: Yes, Grog?

00:34:26.375 --> 00:34:36.623
TRAVIS: I have a question. Do you want to talk to
Thordak's dead spirit, or are you after the big

00:34:36.623 --> 00:34:38.181
shiny jewel in the middle of his chest?

00:34:38.181 --> 00:34:42.168
MATT: "I have no interest in whatever enchantment
shackles him to his insanity. I merely wish to

00:34:42.168 --> 00:34:45.903
"draw from him the secret I've been promised."

00:34:45.903 --> 00:34:47.298
TRAVIS: Insight check to see if he's lying.

00:34:47.298 --> 00:34:48.174
LAURA: Ditto!

00:34:48.174 --> 00:34:49.559
MATT: Insight check, both of you guys, go.

00:34:49.559 --> 00:34:51.403
LAURA: Oh, that was terrible!

00:34:51.403 --> 00:34:52.666
TRAVIS: 18.

00:34:52.666 --> 00:34:57.124
LAURA: Ugh, 13.

00:34:57.124 --> 00:34:58.280
MATT: Seems to be telling the truth.

00:34:58.280 --> 00:34:59.222
TRAVIS: Yeah, sure.

00:34:59.222 --> 00:35:00.617
LAURA: Well, yeah, sure she does.

00:35:00.617 --> 00:35:02.016
TRAVIS: He's telling the truth.

00:35:02.016 --> 00:35:02.804
LAURA: She.

00:35:02.804 --> 00:35:04.381
TRAVIS: She's telling the truth.

00:35:04.381 --> 00:35:17.086
TALIESIN: Once the white dragon's off the board,
then we will hammer out whatever promises can be

00:35:17.086 --> 00:35:24.430
made, but until then, there's just many players on
the field to say one way or another.

00:35:24.430 --> 00:35:29.359
LAURA: Have you been here as Asum this whole time?
What have you been doing?

00:35:29.359 --> 00:35:32.141
MATT: "Gathering information, like I do."

00:35:32.141 --> 00:35:34.886
LAURA: What do you do, sleep in his room like a
halfling?

00:35:34.886 --> 00:35:41.567
TRAVIS: Yeah, do you wear his clothes, and use his
soap, and brush with his toothbrush?

00:35:41.567 --> 00:35:46.824
MATT: "No, I moved down to the stables and found a
soft bit of hay. &lt;i&gt;Yes,&lt;/i&gt; I sleep in his bed and his clothes."

00:35:46.824 --> 00:35:53.885
TRAVIS: That's a lot of attitude to what I feel is
a simple question. It's gross.

00:35:53.885 --> 00:35:54.842
MARISHA: It's pretty gross.

00:35:54.842 --> 00:35:58.498
TALIESIN: It must be so humiliating for you that
you need to turn to us for help. You do have my

00:35:58.498 --> 00:35:59.772
pity in that regard.

00:35:59.772 --> 00:36:06.932
MATT: "It isn't the most optimal circumstance, but
I think we both have much to gain."

00:36:06.932 --> 00:36:12.621
MARISHA: Why do you think Thordak is the only one with
knowledge of a cure?

00:36:12.621 --> 00:36:17.288
MATT: "Because everywhere I've sought the
information seems to have been destroyed by

00:36:17.288 --> 00:36:19.074
"Thordak once we made the accord."

00:36:19.074 --> 00:36:22.331
LAURA: If you tell us what the disease is--

00:36:22.331 --> 00:36:36.674
MARISHA: Because that puny little druid that
cursed you-- well, don't forget you're dealing

00:36:36.674 --> 00:36:38.763
with a puny little druid right here.

00:36:38.763 --> 00:36:43.831
MATT: "You could take a look if you like, but I
myself do not know its nature."

00:36:43.831 --> 00:36:46.296
LAURA: Have you tried Greater Restoration?

00:36:46.296 --> 00:36:47.992
(laughter)

00:36:47.992 --> 00:36:50.657
MARISHA: That seems to be the solution to all of
our problems.

00:36:50.657 --> 00:36:52.724
TALIESIN: It's the chicken soup of Dungeons and
Dragons.

00:36:52.724 --> 00:36:56.314
MARISHA: Chicken soup for the DND soul.

00:36:56.314 --> 00:36:58.737
LIAM: It's feed a curse, starve perma-death.

00:36:58.737 --> 00:37:06.662
TRAVIS: Please, go ahead.

00:37:06.662 --> 00:37:10.162
MATT: "Yes, I have."

00:37:10.162 --> 00:37:11.284
MARISHA: What was the question?

00:37:11.284 --> 00:37:16.976
MATT: "I've tried all forms of cleansing magic.
I've bent many diviners to my aid, and all have

00:37:16.976 --> 00:37:27.553
"failed! This isn't a simple magic, this was a
spirit curse, this was something far more

00:37:27.553 --> 00:37:29.224
"powerful."

00:37:29.224 --> 00:37:34.547
TRAVIS: Sounds like a job for me. (spits) Come
on.

00:37:34.547 --> 00:37:36.736
TALIESIN: You don't have to.

00:37:36.736 --> 00:37:39.059
MATT: "I don't want to."

00:37:39.059 --> 00:37:43.231
TRAVIS: Spit smells funny, you know.

00:37:43.231 --> 00:37:45.823
TALIESIN: Is it two days until the white dragon?

00:37:45.823 --> 00:37:48.146
LAURA: How long do we have?

00:37:48.146 --> 00:37:54.404
TRAVIS: Wait, will Thordak know if we do something
to Vorugal?

00:37:54.404 --> 00:37:56.207
TALIESIN: Of course.

00:37:56.207 --> 00:38:01.243
MATT: "It's likely. Very quickly, yes."

00:38:01.243 --> 00:38:02.170
TRAVIS: Why?

00:38:02.170 --> 00:38:05.767
MATT: "Keeps a close watch on his subjects. He's
paranoid. Requires us to continuously

00:38:05.767 --> 00:38:07.911
"check in, which I have been."

00:38:07.911 --> 00:38:13.352
LAURA: You've been checking in from where? Here?

00:38:13.352 --> 00:38:18.444
MATT: "I have my means in my room, yes."

00:38:18.444 --> 00:38:20.681
LAURA: Does he know where you are?

00:38:20.681 --> 00:38:27.432
MATT: "No. As far as he knows, I'm currently
somewhere on the outskirts of Westruun attempting

00:38:27.432 --> 00:38:31.394
"to forge some sort of vengeance for what happened
to Umbrasyl."

00:38:31.394 --> 00:38:38.755
TALIESIN: If he did find out he was here, it would
be very easy to turn the two of them against each

00:38:38.755 --> 00:38:39.710
other.

00:38:39.710 --> 00:38:52.898
LAURA: So when Vorugal flew over... did he not
sense you?

00:38:52.898 --> 00:39:00.792
MATT: "I'm very good at avoiding the sight of
those who would seek me if I wish not to be seen."

00:39:00.792 --> 00:39:04.925
LAURA: Was he seeking you, or was he seeking
Whitestone?

00:39:04.925 --> 00:39:10.077
MATT: "Based on the correspondence that was put
out by Thordak, he was very perturbed at the death

00:39:10.077 --> 00:39:19.810
"of the black dragon that you've slain. As such,
sent a rather large assortment of his and

00:39:19.810 --> 00:39:26.910
"Vorugal's wyvern army to sweep the entire middle
eastern side of Tal'Dorei in search of you, I

00:39:26.910 --> 00:39:28.284
"presume.

00:39:28.284 --> 00:39:38.686
"Thankfully, your allies put up some sort of
illusory barrier, which I did not disturb during

00:39:38.686 --> 00:39:42.371
"that time, to whatever consolation that is to our
agreement."

00:39:42.371 --> 00:39:48.059
TALIESIN: It is of great consolation. In fact, I
would go so far as to say that I am willing to say

00:39:48.059 --> 00:39:56.341
that these talks will continue post the
destruction of the white dragon, so long as these

00:39:56.341 --> 00:39:58.602
talks take place in Whitestone.

00:39:58.602 --> 00:40:02.304
LAURA: We won't have much time to talk after the
destruction of the white dragon.

00:40:02.304 --> 00:40:08.883
TALIESIN: We'll have enough. And if there is no
Whitestone to hold talks in, there will be no talks.

00:40:08.883 --> 00:40:10.345
MATT: "This is true."

00:40:10.345 --> 00:40:19.679
SAM: One moment. Game this out for me, friends. If
this is all bullshit and Thordak has sent this

00:40:19.679 --> 00:40:29.078
little lady here to trick us into traveling with
her to Draconia, where Thordak is lying in wait to

00:40:29.078 --> 00:40:36.405
kill us the second we get there, well, then if
we're making a deal for this little lady to kill

00:40:36.405 --> 00:40:42.412
on our behalf, why do we need to go? Can we just
stay in Whitestone and you go kill the white

00:40:42.412 --> 00:40:45.659
dragon for us? You're powerful, aren't you? Why do
you need us?

00:40:45.659 --> 00:40:56.334
MATT: "You see, if I were to utilize my full
potential, which would be required to fell

00:40:56.334 --> 00:41:03.061
"Vorugal-- as idiotic as the creature is, it's
still a very dangerous and cunning foe."

00:41:03.061 --> 00:41:06.203
LIAM: Not for you. You're so clever.

00:41:06.203 --> 00:41:13.410
SAM: Yeah, you can pretend to be Vorugal's--
something, pet hamster-- for a while until you

00:41:13.410 --> 00:41:15.265
kill him in his sleep.

00:41:15.265 --> 00:41:23.001
MATT: "Maybe I overestimated your intelligence,
but in doing so, would immediately paint a target

00:41:23.001 --> 00:41:29.011
"on my back for Thordak. I think it's best that I
remain in his good graces, as we all flank up

00:41:29.011 --> 00:41:31.482
"unexpectedly when the time is right."

00:41:31.482 --> 00:41:32.642
TALIESIN: He is correct.

00:41:32.642 --> 00:41:33.879
MATT: "She!"

00:41:33.879 --> 00:41:35.823
TALIESIN: I'm really enjoying that.

00:41:35.823 --> 00:41:41.766
TRAVIS: I would also say that if she wanted to set
a trap with three dragons on us, they would all be

00:41:41.766 --> 00:41:43.146
here right now.

00:41:43.146 --> 00:41:50.662
TALIESIN: Also, they could've avoided it entirely
and waited for us to go to Draconia, as opposed to

00:41:50.662 --> 00:41:55.374
having someone come by to remind us that we were
going to Draconia in the first place. It seems

00:41:55.374 --> 00:41:57.153
like an awful lot of work.

00:41:57.153 --> 00:42:01.663
MARISHA: I still don't really know why we need her
to begin with. We're powerful enough. Why don't we

00:42:01.663 --> 00:42:02.959
just kill her now?

00:42:02.959 --> 00:42:05.697
TALIESIN: Honestly? Because it would damage the
castle.

00:42:05.697 --> 00:42:09.755
TRAVIS: No, don't provoke--

00:42:09.755 --> 00:42:12.733
SAM: What is that move? Don't do that.

00:42:12.733 --> 00:42:16.397
MARISHA: Are you inviting?

00:42:16.397 --> 00:42:25.821
MATT: "I'm saying the choice is yours. Either we
work together, or you all fall."

00:42:25.821 --> 00:42:30.685
TRAVIS: Come on. Even my simple mind sees the
advantages here.

00:42:30.685 --> 00:42:36.769
LIAM: Keyleth. All we're debating is the order in
which they die.

00:42:36.769 --> 00:42:42.576
MARISHA: She was first on my list.

00:42:42.576 --> 00:43:02.611
TALIESIN: I don't recommend lists. The only reason
I'm stopping you from doing this-- and I swear

00:43:02.611 --> 00:43:05.858
this is the truth-- is because this is my home.

00:43:05.858 --> 00:43:07.954
MARISHA: But this could be our best chance.

00:43:07.954 --> 00:43:09.677
TALIESIN: There would be nothing left.

00:43:09.677 --> 00:43:10.914
MARISHA: Could be the easiest--

00:43:10.914 --> 00:43:22.272
MATT: "Half-elf. Look at me. Your worldview is
clouded by optimism that does not belong in

00:43:22.272 --> 00:43:33.459
"Exandria. There is good, there is evil, but this
world has been remade many times because life is

"destruction. You should know this as a purveyor of
life in its own right. The cycle lives on. The

dies or is eaten. You can put whatever fine

"dressing on it you like."

00:43:54.118 --> 00:43:56.050
LIAM: Yeah, shut the fuck up, sick bag.

00:43:56.050 --> 00:44:01.576
MARISHA: She's not making this easy to walk away,
you guys!

00:44:01.576 --> 00:44:10.229
LIAM: Percy is right. We don't want the
people of Whitestone to fall like the people of

00:44:10.229 --> 00:44:13.629
the Ashari.

00:44:13.629 --> 00:44:15.570
LAURA: More deaths do not make it right, Keyleth.

00:44:15.570 --> 00:44:17.957
TRAVIS: You're going to get yours. You're going to
get it.

00:44:17.957 --> 00:44:23.711
MATT: "Are you telling me you have not claimed a
life or two in your time? Do you think your goals

00:44:23.711 --> 00:44:29.497
"and your attempts to save those close to you have
not been wrought with bloodshed?"

00:44:29.497 --> 00:44:40.389
MARISHA: Oh, I know the consequences of every step
of my actions. It is you, Raishan, who did not

00:44:40.389 --> 00:44:44.198
realize the biggest consequence is standing in
front of you right now.

00:44:44.198 --> 00:44:48.645
MATT: "Do you think you have not stepped on an
anthill to get to your destination?"

00:44:48.645 --> 00:44:50.954
MARISHA: I don't give a flying shit.

00:44:50.954 --> 00:44:54.667
MATT: "I merely stepped on an anthill to get to
mine."

00:44:54.667 --> 00:44:56.797
LIAM: You're just fucking winding her up, man.

00:44:56.797 --> 00:45:07.472
MATT: "Understand, there are different levels of
thought, intellect, and intent here. I come to you

00:45:07.472 --> 00:45:14.240
"because we have much to gain together. Or lose
everything by not listening to what I have to say."

00:45:14.240 --> 00:45:16.973
TALIESIN: You will join us in the fight against
the white dragon.

00:45:16.973 --> 00:45:24.178
MATT: "I will, if you promise to let Thordak's
soul be mine."

00:45:24.178 --> 00:45:27.143
TALIESIN: Nope, that's not the deal.

00:45:27.143 --> 00:45:30.217
LIAM: We're talking about a second round of
negotiations.

00:45:30.217 --> 00:45:35.670
TALIESIN: We will consider your offer once the
white dragon is dead, not a minute before.

00:45:35.670 --> 00:45:37.746
MATT: "This isn't a negotiation."

00:45:37.746 --> 00:45:40.668
TALIESIN: This is everything of a negotiation, you
fool.

00:45:40.668 --> 00:45:42.522
MATT: "What am I getting out of this?"

00:45:42.522 --> 00:45:44.132
TALIESIN: Your life!

00:45:44.132 --> 00:45:46.852
SAM: An opportunity to prove yourself to us.

00:45:46.852 --> 00:45:47.975
TALIESIN: A cure to yourself.

00:45:47.975 --> 00:45:51.418
LAURA: A chance to take down Thordak. You said
yourself you can't do it on your own.

00:45:51.418 --> 00:45:54.554
LIAM: We haven't danced with a dragon that now
stands breathing.

00:45:54.554 --> 00:45:57.072
TALIESIN: Your desperation is so obvious.

00:45:57.072 --> 00:46:03.579
MARISHA: We walk away, and you die. Or we stay,
(whispering) and you die.

00:46:03.579 --> 00:46:20.686
MATT: "If I aid you with the tearing of Vorugal as
a show of goodwill, in response, you keep my true

00:46:20.686 --> 00:46:23.659
"nature secret between those in this room."

00:46:23.659 --> 00:46:27.772
TRAVIS: Oh. Yeah.

00:46:27.772 --> 00:46:33.281
MATT: "You maintain that I have access to the
length and breadth of Whitestone."

00:46:33.281 --> 00:46:41.295
TRAVIS: Wait a minute. Why the length and bread of
Whitestone?

00:46:41.295 --> 00:46:49.959
MATT: "Largely because I have interests in
deciding my plan against Thordak. Let's just say

00:46:49.959 --> 00:46:55.734
"some of it may include a trinket or two that have
come in your way on your travels."

00:46:55.734 --> 00:47:04.695
TRAVIS: Are you fully aware of what lies beneath
Whitestone?

00:47:04.695 --> 00:47:08.019
MATT: "I have some ideas."

00:47:08.019 --> 00:47:09.794
TALIESIN: Would you like to see it?

00:47:09.794 --> 00:47:12.868
MATT: "I have seen it already."

00:47:12.868 --> 00:47:14.170
TALIESIN: Have you?

00:47:14.170 --> 00:47:15.370
LAURA: You've been down there?

00:47:15.370 --> 00:47:18.294
MATT: "I've been here for some time, my dear."

00:47:18.294 --> 00:47:21.845
LAURA: Then why didn't we meet down there? Why are
you so scared of it?

00:47:21.845 --> 00:47:24.162
TRAVIS: Yeah, if you've seen it, tell us what it
is.

00:47:24.162 --> 00:47:28.688
MARISHA: I know. You know.

00:47:28.688 --> 00:47:30.209
TALIESIN: Of course he--

00:47:30.209 --> 00:47:34.605
SAM: You say it first.

00:47:34.605 --> 00:47:38.960
MATT: "I'm not telling you anything. That was not
part of the negotiation."

00:47:38.960 --> 00:47:41.423
TRAVIS: How big is it? If you've seen it.

00:47:41.423 --> 00:47:44.887
(laughter)

00:47:44.887 --> 00:47:46.559
SAM: Describe it.

00:47:46.559 --> 00:47:50.498
TALIESIN: One dead white dragon and then--

00:47:50.498 --> 00:47:53.039
MARISHA: Oh jeez, what is that?

00:47:53.039 --> 00:48:01.576
MATT: Raishan snaps her fingers. You see a spark,
and you notice a brief burst akin to a minor

00:48:01.576 --> 00:48:06.359
illusion. No sound, nothing, just the image of a
tiny black orb.

00:48:06.359 --> 00:48:09.046
TRAVIS: Shit! She's seen it.

00:48:09.046 --> 00:48:22.297
TALIESIN: One dead white dragon, and then the
negotiations continue. We will speak to no one of

00:48:22.297 --> 00:48:28.637
what you truly are, although we may caution others
that we're looking a bit sideways at Seeker Asum.

00:48:28.637 --> 00:48:35.009
MATT: "I would recommend none of that. Any
suspicion means I'm being followed. If I'm

00:48:35.009 --> 00:48:41.720
"followed and feeling threatened, the person you
told may not survive. We do not want that, but I'm

00:48:41.720 --> 00:48:46.957
"going to look out for myself, so anyone you tell,
you're putting in danger."

00:48:46.957 --> 00:48:48.585
TALIESIN: That's also fair.

00:48:48.585 --> 00:48:54.914
MARISHA: Anyone you touch, you're then putting
yourself in danger. If any of our friends wind up

00:48:54.914 --> 00:48:57.822
dead, we're looking at you first.

00:48:57.822 --> 00:48:59.802
MATT: "Fair enough."

00:48:59.802 --> 00:49:01.899
LAURA: Have you done anything with the rest of our
friends?

00:49:01.899 --> 00:49:07.340
MARISHA: Where's Asum? Did we already cover that?

00:49:07.340 --> 00:49:08.851
LAURA: Yeah, we already covered that.

00:49:08.851 --> 00:49:11.145
MARISHA: I was very angry. I couldn't hear a whole
lot.

00:49:11.145 --> 00:49:16.209
TALIESIN: Whitestone will not fall. If Whitestone
falls, all deals are off. If Whitestone is

00:49:16.209 --> 00:49:19.285
attacked, all deals are off. You keep it off the
radar.

00:49:19.285 --> 00:49:24.403
MATT: "It's already off the radar. I just will not
touch the radar."

00:49:24.403 --> 00:49:25.814
TALIESIN: That'll do.

00:49:25.814 --> 00:49:26.917
LIAM: What is radar?

00:49:26.917 --> 00:49:28.221
MATT: "I don't know."

00:49:28.221 --> 00:49:31.563
TALIESIN: Do you never go into my room? Do you
never look at what I'm working on?

00:49:31.563 --> 00:49:33.438
SAM: What room are we in right now?

00:49:33.438 --> 00:49:36.062
MATT: This is the old war room, which is upstairs
facing the front.

00:49:36.062 --> 00:49:40.553
LAURA: The old war room, because we moved the new
one down into the ziggurat and she didn't respect that!

00:49:40.553 --> 00:49:41.394
MATT: Nope.

00:49:41.394 --> 00:49:43.938
MARISHA: (whispers) Bitch.

00:49:43.938 --> 00:49:46.691
LIAM: I said (singing) bitch.

00:49:46.691 --> 00:49:51.447
SAM: How big is the room?

00:49:51.447 --> 00:49:58.701
MATT: It's about, I'd say-- close to 30 feet by 60
feet.

00:49:58.701 --> 00:50:01.215
SAM: How many entrances?

00:50:01.215 --> 00:50:04.321
MATT: There's two doors that enter, and then two
windows that face out the front.

00:50:04.321 --> 00:50:06.662
LAURA: Are you going to attack her all of a
sudden? Are you going to attack her right now?

00:50:06.662 --> 00:50:08.848
SAM: We should probably kill her right now.

00:50:08.848 --> 00:50:15.567
MARISHA: I agree with that! Can I do a scan of the
room, like a perception check to see if I notice

00:50:15.567 --> 00:50:20.080
magical traps or anything weird set up?

00:50:20.080 --> 00:50:21.539
MATT: Make an investigation check.

00:50:21.539 --> 00:50:22.759
MARISHA: Investigation?

00:50:22.759 --> 00:50:24.499
MATT: If you're looking for traps, it's
investigation.

00:50:24.499 --> 00:50:27.293
MARISHA: No, is there anything off? Does it look
like there's an opening?

00:50:27.293 --> 00:50:29.011
MATT: Make a general perception check.

00:50:29.011 --> 00:50:32.174
TRAVIS: We can kill her whenever. Might as well
use her.

00:50:32.174 --> 00:50:38.198
MARISHA: General perception? 21.

00:50:38.198 --> 00:50:43.819
MATT: 21? Glancing about the room, it does not
appear to have anything that you notice different.

00:50:43.819 --> 00:50:47.375
It has the two banners on the side walls. It has
the table in the center with some chairs scattered

00:50:47.375 --> 00:50:55.942
about and there's the two windows opposite. One
window that currently Raishan has to her back.

00:50:55.942 --> 00:51:04.647
LIAM: I don't think Scanlan is wrong. I think he
is weak.

00:51:04.647 --> 00:51:08.320
LAURA: Why?

00:51:08.320 --> 00:51:09.494
SAM: It.

00:51:09.494 --> 00:51:18.503
LIAM: However, she will try to destroy as much as
possible out of spite in her death throes.

00:51:18.503 --> 00:51:24.940
TALIESIN: Thus also exposing the city. We will be
attacked. That will be the end of Whitestone.

00:51:24.940 --> 00:51:33.562
TRAVIS: I walk up very gingerly to Keyleth, and I
grab one of her antlers very gently, and I say:

00:51:33.562 --> 00:51:43.077
Look, if you want to go, we're with you, but if
you exercise a little patience, I think we'll get

00:51:43.077 --> 00:51:45.889
more out of this, and you'll still get yours in
the end.

00:51:45.889 --> 00:51:50.671
MARISHA: Is Grog talking to me about patience
right now?

00:51:50.671 --> 00:51:52.598
LAURA: That's very important.

00:51:52.598 --> 00:51:53.782
MARISHA: That's so extreme.

00:51:53.782 --> 00:52:01.591
TRAVIS: Don't get me wrong, I want to crack it
open right now, but we'll get more later.

00:52:01.591 --> 00:52:03.122
LIAM: He's learned a lot.

00:52:03.122 --> 00:52:06.109
MARISHA: Grog--

00:52:06.109 --> 00:52:19.828
TALIESIN: I guarantee you, the complete lack of
satisfaction that you feel when she's finally dead

00:52:19.828 --> 00:52:22.858
will be just as potent two days from now.

00:52:22.858 --> 00:52:31.971
MARISHA: Did Thordak tell you about the trinkets
of ours that you wanted?

00:52:31.971 --> 00:52:38.639
MATT: "Thordak has no idea what lies beneath this
city. Thordak is too obsessed with himself."

00:52:38.639 --> 00:52:40.344
MARISHA: About what we have, I mean.

00:52:40.344 --> 00:52:45.901
MATT: "Are you referring to your Vestiges?"

00:52:45.901 --> 00:52:47.175
MARISHA: She knows.

00:52:47.175 --> 00:52:52.367
MATT: "You already told me everything. You
informed me of your entire journey."

00:52:52.367 --> 00:52:55.646
LAURA: I know, okay! Because we're really smart
and we totally--

00:52:55.646 --> 00:52:59.699
SAM: We knew it was you all along. We want you to
know what you're up against.

00:52:59.699 --> 00:53:00.920
LAURA: That's right.

00:53:00.920 --> 00:53:01.957
MATT: "Of course you did."

00:53:01.957 --> 00:53:03.085
LIAM: Taunting you all along.

00:53:03.085 --> 00:53:08.047
MARISHA: We thought she was Asum. We talked, and
she knows. She knows. We told her everything. What

00:53:08.047 --> 00:53:09.331
does he want?

00:53:09.331 --> 00:53:19.731
MATT: "What does Thordak want? Thordak wants
everything. Everything. Thordak is using the

00:53:19.731 --> 00:53:29.590
"crystal in his belly to slowly build a volcano
beneath Emon. To turn the surrounding city and the

00:53:29.590 --> 00:53:32.442
"countryside into a new mountain of his visage."

00:53:32.442 --> 00:53:35.837
LAURA: How long until that happens?

00:53:35.837 --> 00:53:40.890
MATT: "That's going to be another hundred years
before the entire mountain is complete, but the

00:53:40.890 --> 00:53:47.812
"physicality is already adjusting. The molten rock
begins to swirl and flow beneath the Cloudtop

00:53:47.812 --> 00:53:49.020
"District."

00:53:49.020 --> 00:53:51.770
TRAVIS: Wait, you said he's building a volcano?

00:53:51.770 --> 00:53:58.467
MATT: "Well, the volcano is being summoned beneath
him. Such is the nature of the crystal he carries.

00:53:58.467 --> 00:54:03.993
"The energy he absorbed from the fire elemental
plane carried over with him, and it's still

00:54:03.993 --> 00:54:10.515
"hungry. It's why he swells; that's why he's in
pain. But he just laughs amidst it, as it also

00:54:10.515 --> 00:54:13.495
"gives him extreme power and nigh
invulnerability."

00:54:13.495 --> 00:54:19.644
TRAVIS: And you said you knew Thordak before he
was trapped in the elemental plane. Was he, in any

00:54:19.644 --> 00:54:24.494
way, on what is now known as Glintshore before the
elemental plane?

00:54:24.494 --> 00:54:30.073
MATT: "It's possible. I have no knowledge of this
Glintshore."

00:54:30.073 --> 00:54:34.720
LIAM: What do you know about the Briarwoods?

00:54:34.720 --> 00:54:39.216
MATT: "I don't think I know anything about some
Briarwoods."

00:54:39.216 --> 00:54:45.463
LIAM: Really? What do you think about the wall
surrounding that beach ball down there? It's a

00:54:45.463 --> 00:54:47.045
little creepy down there, isn't it?

00:54:47.045 --> 00:54:51.232
MATT: "It's a little off-putting, yes."

00:54:51.232 --> 00:54:56.532
LIAM: You expect us to believe you know nothing,
as smart as you are, you know &lt;i&gt;nothing&lt;/i&gt; of what

00:54:56.532 --> 00:54:58.661
happened there in the months past.

00:54:58.661 --> 00:55:00.324
MATT: "I know what I've been told."

00:55:00.324 --> 00:55:06.361
LIAM: Are you sure you're not trying to summon
something awful out of that marble?

00:55:06.361 --> 00:55:12.161
MATT: "Do you think I wish to have another
creature that I pay subservience to?"

00:55:12.161 --> 00:55:13.866
LAURA: No.

00:55:13.866 --> 00:55:15.749
TRAVIS: Maybe if he can heal you.

00:55:15.749 --> 00:55:21.266
LAURA: Is Melora an enemy of Vecna? Do we know
that?

00:55:21.266 --> 00:55:31.654
MATT: Essentially, Melora is the goddess of the
wilderness and the sea. Very nature, life,

00:55:31.654 --> 00:55:40.896
elemental-based deity. Vecna is not a god. Vecna
was very powerful, wanted to become a god and was

00:55:40.896 --> 00:55:50.274
balked and scattered, supposedly destroyed a long
time ago but the cults still endure and infiltrate

00:55:50.274 --> 00:55:52.550
and wander various parts of Exandria.

00:55:52.550 --> 00:55:54.570
LIAM: What do you want to do with that thing?

00:55:54.570 --> 00:56:02.159
MATT: "It pertains to what I think is a sound plan
to bring Thordak down to our level."

00:56:02.159 --> 00:56:04.061
LIAM: Well, tell me a little bit more.

00:56:04.061 --> 00:56:07.511
MATT: "I will tell you, once we finish this next
length of your journey, since you are so eager to

00:56:07.511 --> 00:56:09.266
"have made the agreement."

00:56:09.266 --> 00:56:10.510
LAURA: Makes sense.

00:56:10.510 --> 00:56:13.907
LIAM: I think you're lying through your teeth. I
think you want something you're not telling us

00:56:13.907 --> 00:56:17.888
about, but I do want the white dragon dead, and we
can work on it later.

00:56:17.888 --> 00:56:21.628
SAM: Let's all agree that this is definitely
bullshit.

00:56:21.628 --> 00:56:29.102
TALIESIN: No, I'm going to disagree. I think that
everything that she said is the truth, and I think

00:56:29.102 --> 00:56:34.725
that she's not saying an awful lot more. Deception
is far less interesting if you're not telling the

00:56:34.725 --> 00:56:40.419
truth all the time, and I think she's telling a
lot of truth, just not nearly all of it.

00:56:40.419 --> 00:56:42.814
LIAM: Lies of omission are a tricky thing, aren't
they?

00:56:42.814 --> 00:56:47.115
TALIESIN: They're far more tricky than simple
lies, and I think that we've heard an awful lot of truth.

00:56:47.115 --> 00:56:49.256
TRAVIS: I'm confused.

00:56:49.256 --> 00:56:53.104
TALIESIN: So yes, I'm willing to work with what we
have.

00:56:53.104 --> 00:56:57.592
MARISHA: Do you have any ideas on how to defeat
Vorugal?

00:56:57.592 --> 00:57:05.957
MATT: "Well, for one thing, I will be peripheral
to the battle. I will aid you, but I cannot be

00:57:05.957 --> 00:57:14.062
"seen on the battlefield, or Thordak will know
immediately there has been a turn of allegiance."

00:57:14.062 --> 00:57:15.933
LAURA: So what good are you? What can you do?

00:57:15.933 --> 00:57:18.301
SAM: Can you shapeshift into other beasts?

00:57:18.301 --> 00:57:24.398
MATT: "I can change my form into a number of
creatures and be of assistance in that way. I have

00:57:24.398 --> 00:57:28.015
"a series of arcane talents that I can bring to the
battlefield, as well."

00:57:28.015 --> 00:57:32.830
SAM: We needed a beast to bait Vorugal with.

00:57:32.830 --> 00:57:35.416
LAURA: I have an idea with that.

00:57:35.416 --> 00:57:39.072
TALIESIN: I believe we're all on the same page.

00:57:39.072 --> 00:57:41.947
MARISHA: What's interesting is the way that
stacks, too.

00:57:41.947 --> 00:57:44.072
TRAVIS: Go ahead, or do you want to save it?

00:57:44.072 --> 00:57:48.686
LAURA: If we're in this together, can I say it in
front of her?

00:57:48.686 --> 00:57:49.645
SAM: Sure.

00:57:49.645 --> 00:57:51.700
TRAVIS: No, don't.

00:57:51.700 --> 00:57:57.029
SAM: Well, she'll need to know, at some point.
Once we get there.

00:57:57.029 --> 00:58:03.048
TRAVIS: I say we agree on principle. We agree--

00:58:03.048 --> 00:58:07.463
TALIESIN: Yes, we agree.

00:58:07.463 --> 00:58:11.939
TRAVIS: I agree. Hands?

00:58:11.939 --> 00:58:14.215
SAM: What are we agreeing on?

00:58:14.215 --> 00:58:17.003
TRAVIS: To fight with Raishan.

00:58:17.003 --> 00:58:20.252
TALIESIN: I'm in this far.

00:58:20.252 --> 00:58:27.064
SAM: You don't need our votes. It's already
decided.

00:58:27.064 --> 00:58:32.765
TRAVIS: You're abstaining? I really wish you would
vote. Your vote matters.

00:58:32.765 --> 00:58:36.304
SAM: Is voting this time important, particularly?

00:58:36.304 --> 00:58:38.528
LIAM: Jump on the carpet and go kill her, anyway.

00:58:38.528 --> 00:58:43.614
SAM: But if I don't vote, won't someone else vote
for me?

00:58:43.614 --> 00:58:48.053
TRAVIS: No, you actually sway the vote in greater
ways than you can possibly imagine. Very

00:58:48.053 --> 00:58:49.093
important.

00:58:49.093 --> 00:58:50.844
SAM: I don't even know how. Is it easy to find
out?

00:58:50.844 --> 00:58:52.434
TRAVIS: I'm sure the internet has all your
answers.

00:58:52.434 --> 00:58:55.678
SAM: I should go online and find out how to
register to vote.

00:58:55.678 --> 00:59:00.646
LIAM: Look, it's never an easy choice, but you
have to fall down on one side or the other,

00:59:00.646 --> 00:59:01.735
Scanlan.

00:59:01.735 --> 00:59:04.391
LAURA: Preferably one that doesn't rely on hate as
a message.

00:59:04.391 --> 00:59:08.301
TALIESIN: Okay, we've gone far enough off the
track. Okay, reeling it back.

00:59:08.301 --> 00:59:11.327
SAM: All right, let's kill a dragon and feel that
burn.

00:59:11.327 --> 00:59:16.290
(laughter)

00:59:16.290 --> 00:59:20.227
LIAM: Oh, Chris Hardwick as Gern, coming in for
the political joke!

00:59:20.227 --> 00:59:25.101
SAM: All right, I'm in, for now.

00:59:25.101 --> 00:59:26.773
MATT: "All right."

00:59:26.773 --> 00:59:34.214
MARISHA: Keyleth holds her hand out to shake her
hand.

00:59:34.214 --> 00:59:40.066
LIAM: I am drawing a blade behind my back.

00:59:40.066 --> 00:59:45.948
MATT: Asum walks around the table slowly, making
eye contact with you, those yellow, reptilian

00:59:45.948 --> 00:59:58.615
slits for eyes. Brushes past you. "You've grown
quite a bit in just these few moments, young Keyleth."

00:59:58.615 --> 01:00:09.537
MARISHA: I heat up my hands a little bit with my
flame hands. Feel the burn.

01:00:09.537 --> 01:00:16.425
SAM: The dragon dies.

01:00:16.425 --> 01:00:19.496
(laughter)

01:00:19.496 --> 01:00:29.395
MATT: She stands there, keeping the grip, and then
releases your hand. "Very well. What's your plan

01:00:29.395 --> 01:00:32.398
"against Vorugal?"

01:00:32.398 --> 01:00:42.152
TRAVIS: We need a moment. I feel like the emotions
in here are a bit raw. Can we please?

01:00:42.152 --> 01:00:47.955
TALIESIN: We will reconvene tomorrow for battle.
Plan for travel. Tomorrow morning to arrange

01:00:47.955 --> 01:00:50.372
travel and the battle plan towards--

01:00:50.372 --> 01:00:53.251
SAM: Shouldn't we keep an eye on this one all
night?

01:00:53.251 --> 01:00:54.209
TALIESIN: No.

01:00:54.209 --> 01:00:56.315
LAURA: What? We haven't kept an eye on her the
whole time.

01:00:56.315 --> 01:01:00.276
SAM: I know, but she could be sneaking around,
creeping into rooms--

01:01:00.276 --> 01:01:02.317
TALIESIN: That she hasn't already creeped into?

01:01:02.317 --> 01:01:07.384
MATT: "I can guarantee you you're not wrong, but I
have been and I will, regardless of what you try."

01:01:07.384 --> 01:01:11.253
SAM: She could come into my room at night and do
things to me that I don't want to be done.

01:01:11.253 --> 01:01:13.331
TRAVIS: Let's be honest, there's nothing--

01:01:13.331 --> 01:01:15.566
TALIESIN: Let's be fair.

01:01:15.566 --> 01:01:18.404
LAURA: You're giving her ideas right now, aren't
you?

01:01:18.404 --> 01:01:24.222
TALIESIN: I'm not changing the status of the
castle. She has the same status she had before,

01:01:24.222 --> 01:01:26.203
there's no sense in changing them.

01:01:26.203 --> 01:01:29.334
SAM: I'm going to have sex with every beast on
every continent.

01:01:29.334 --> 01:01:31.344
TALIESIN: Thank you, Captain Kirk.

01:01:31.344 --> 01:01:34.173
MATT: (singing) Gotta catch 'em all.

01:01:34.173 --> 01:01:37.403
(laughter)

01:01:37.403 --> 01:01:40.200
TALIESIN: I'm content with this.

01:01:40.200 --> 01:01:48.497
MATT: "Very well. I'll go check in with the boss,
if you will. Alleviate any concern on his end."

01:01:48.497 --> 01:01:49.805
TALIESIN: Thank you.

01:01:49.805 --> 01:01:51.224
MATT: "We shall meet tomorrow."

01:01:51.224 --> 01:01:52.688
TALIESIN: See you tomorrow.

01:01:52.688 --> 01:01:57.674
MARISHA: Can I get an insight check on that "check
in with the boss?" See if she's going to turn

01:01:57.674 --> 01:01:59.731
around and tell him everything.

01:01:59.731 --> 01:02:01.068
LAURA: Natural 20!

01:02:01.068 --> 01:02:06.359
MARISHA: Come on, natural 20! It wasn't bad. It
was a 15, so 26.

01:02:06.359 --> 01:02:07.744
TRAVIS: That's not a 20.

01:02:07.744 --> 01:02:09.501
SAM: Whispers.

01:02:09.501 --> 01:02:14.223
TALIESIN: While you're whispering, Sam's got
another rap for you.

01:02:14.223 --> 01:02:17.245
SAM: Do I?

01:02:17.245 --> 01:02:25.942
LIAM: (rapping) Whenever I go to the Loot Crate,
somebody kill me now 'cause of the embarrassment

01:02:25.942 --> 01:02:28.482
I'm experiencing, live in front of the Internet.

01:02:28.482 --> 01:02:29.914
TALIESIN: Hey-o.

01:02:29.914 --> 01:02:36.480
TRAVIS: Holy shit. I was alive for that. I was
alive for that just now.

01:02:36.480 --> 01:02:39.222
LIAM: I didn't have a sideways hat. I needed a
sideways hat.

01:02:39.222 --> 01:02:41.174
TRAVIS: The glasses didn't help, either.

01:02:41.174 --> 01:02:44.831
LIAM: What is this? Manure Movers of America?

01:02:44.831 --> 01:02:46.639
SAM: That's my hat.

01:02:46.639 --> 01:02:50.268
TALIESIN: The feather shirt really adds the
whole--

01:02:50.268 --> 01:02:53.533
(laughter)

01:02:53.533 --> 01:02:55.472
SAM: Yeah, boi!

01:02:55.472 --> 01:02:56.892
MATT: Raishan looks very confused.

01:02:56.892 --> 01:03:00.173
MARISHA: All right, let's go.

01:03:00.173 --> 01:03:06.672
MATT: "Very well. See you tomorrow." The image of
the veins, the scales, everything, reverts back to

01:03:06.672 --> 01:03:09.765
normal. Seeker Asum nods and leaves the room.

01:03:09.765 --> 01:03:13.646
TALIESIN: Downstairs, to the real room. To the
real room, downstairs. Downstairs, to the real room.

01:03:13.646 --> 01:03:18.200
SAM: To the real war room, magically incapable
of--

01:03:18.200 --> 01:03:19.353
LAURA: Yes.

01:03:19.353 --> 01:03:24.379
SAM: Okay, but wait, before we go down there, two
things: Keyleth, can you scry today?

01:03:24.379 --> 01:03:27.182
MARISHA: Yes, I can.

01:03:27.182 --> 01:03:28.935
TALIESIN: Do not!

01:03:28.935 --> 01:03:34.388
SAM: We could check in on Vorugal. Make sure that
Vorugal is actually there.

01:03:34.388 --> 01:03:37.576
LAURA: Don't actually look at Vorugal, look at
something near Vorugal.

01:03:37.576 --> 01:03:45.563
SAM: Just to make sure Vorugal is in town and not
here. We could look into Raishan's room right now

01:03:45.563 --> 01:03:50.190
and watch how it communicates with its boss.

01:03:50.190 --> 01:03:53.992
TALIESIN: Absolutely do not think that's a good
idea.

01:03:53.992 --> 01:03:56.272
LAURA: I don't think so, either. She'll know.

01:03:56.272 --> 01:03:58.216
MARISHA: Yeah, let's go down to the war room.

01:03:58.216 --> 01:04:02.345
SAM: She'll go ape-shit and what? So we kill her.
We're better than she is!

01:04:02.345 --> 01:04:04.096
TALIESIN: We're really not.

01:04:04.096 --> 01:04:08.517
LIAM: She's obviously hiding shit from us, and if
one of us goes and pokes our nose in there, she's

01:04:08.517 --> 01:04:11.155
going to start a draw, right there.

01:04:11.155 --> 01:04:13.813
MARISHA: Are we in the war room? Can we go down
and talk about this in the war room?

01:04:13.813 --> 01:04:18.912
MATT: All right, so you guys make your way through
Whitestone through the tunnels to the location of

01:04:18.912 --> 01:04:22.882
the ziggurat. The war room is a series of tables
and chairs that have been assembled on the top of

01:04:22.882 --> 01:04:32.234
the ziggurat, near the spinning bead of death, as
you call it. But yeah, it's makeshift, it's

01:04:32.234 --> 01:04:37.238
functional. There's currently nobody else in here
even though there are a couple of guards stationed

01:04:37.238 --> 01:04:43.732
to make sure that nobody comes in here without
approval. You are currently stepping up to the top

01:04:43.732 --> 01:04:47.518
of the ziggurat, and there it rests, still
spinning silently in place.

01:04:47.518 --> 01:04:49.995
TRAVIS: Drop it on them.

01:04:49.995 --> 01:04:54.089
LAURA: I sit on the table. What's going on?

01:04:54.089 --> 01:04:55.894
TRAVIS: No, tell them your plan.

01:04:55.894 --> 01:05:00.015
MARISHA: Keyleth screams her head off for a
second.

01:05:00.015 --> 01:05:03.442
LAURA: You did well, dear.

01:05:03.442 --> 01:05:15.732
TALIESIN: I know how hard that was. I know. And I
wish I could say I did as well as you did, when it

01:05:15.732 --> 01:05:17.408
was my turn.

01:05:17.408 --> 01:05:22.426
MARISHA: I don't think I understood until that
moment what you did.

01:05:22.426 --> 01:05:26.910
LIAM: You'll have your day. Absolutely.

01:05:26.910 --> 01:05:38.139
TALIESIN: We can't spy on her. Well, we &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; spy
on her, but we have to be careful. We shouldn't

01:05:38.139 --> 01:05:44.481
spy on her when she's speaking to Thordak because
Thordak might see it, which would mean that plan

01:05:44.481 --> 01:05:46.783
or no plan, everything would be ruined.

01:05:46.783 --> 01:05:53.693
LIAM: If Thordak senses, sees, any one of us in
the same place as her, he will go mad.

01:05:53.693 --> 01:06:04.407
TALIESIN: And then if I were her, I would destroy
this city and all of us as quickly as possible and run.

01:06:04.407 --> 01:06:10.519
LAURA: I feel like she needs to talk to the spirit
because she's going to try to absorb his power or

01:06:10.519 --> 01:06:11.652
something.

01:06:11.652 --> 01:06:21.413
MARISHA: She's a fucking idiot. What do I know
about Melora and this curse? Because there are a

01:06:21.413 --> 01:06:23.606
lot of druids who worship Melora.

01:06:23.606 --> 01:06:25.471
MATT: Make a religion check.

01:06:25.471 --> 01:06:36.413
MARISHA: That's not good. I never do religion
checks. Nine.

01:06:36.413 --> 01:06:51.110
MATT: You know that Melora is worshipped by druids
of nature, hunters, societies that exist in a more

01:06:51.110 --> 01:06:58.904
natural setting, as well as ship captains, oversea
merchants, in hopes of getting good luck in

01:06:58.904 --> 01:07:08.067
getting across large bodies of water and weather.
She is considered by some to be good, some

01:07:08.067 --> 01:07:13.771
consider her to be in a neutral space and more of
like a mother nature type entity amongst the

01:07:13.771 --> 01:07:23.028
pantheon here, if there was one. And as far as
curses go, you don't have too much experience with

01:07:23.028 --> 01:07:30.915
curses outside of the minor ones that you've seen
used or have yourself at your disposal. But even

01:07:30.915 --> 01:07:34.005
just from the few of you, Sam especially, Sam, go
ahead and roll an intelligence check.

01:07:34.005 --> 01:07:34.949
SAM: Who, me?

01:07:34.949 --> 01:07:36.242
MATT: Yes.

01:07:36.242 --> 01:07:43.748
SAM: I need my thing. Hold on. Intelligence?
Straight intelligence?

01:07:43.748 --> 01:07:44.839
MATT: Yes.

01:07:44.839 --> 01:07:46.647
SAM: 16.

01:07:46.647 --> 01:07:49.055
MATT: 16, and you get to add your plus two.

01:07:49.055 --> 01:07:50.255
SAM: 18.

01:07:50.255 --> 01:07:54.523
MATT: And if you wanted to, add your inspiration
die.

01:07:54.523 --> 01:07:59.266
SAM: I will inspire myself, which is d12 now,
right?

01:07:59.266 --> 01:08:00.526
MATT: Yeah, d12.

01:08:00.526 --> 01:08:03.001
SAM: 26.

01:08:03.001 --> 01:08:04.202
MATT: 26, okay.

01:08:04.202 --> 01:08:05.907
SAM: Wow. That escalated fast.

01:08:05.907 --> 01:08:13.312
MATT: That's what you can do as a bard; it's
pretty rad. Through the two of you conversing over

01:08:13.312 --> 01:08:20.143
this, there are simple curses that can be imparted
for a temporary period of time, usually as some

01:08:20.143 --> 01:08:27.794
sort of a penance to someone who slighted you.
Some that are part of a corruption on the land, a

01:08:27.794 --> 01:08:36.179
blight that spreads to a life source. And there
are soul curses. Usually where someone feels so

01:08:36.179 --> 01:08:42.097
wronged in their final moments that they basically
burn their soul and any possibility of the

01:08:42.097 --> 01:08:51.279
afterlife purely to scourge whoever was
responsible for their pain. It's rarely ever done,

01:08:51.279 --> 01:08:57.919
because it is essentially accepting oblivion. Your
existence is done. The gods don't hold any sway

01:08:57.919 --> 01:09:03.403
over your immortal soul; there is no afterlife.
However, you die knowing, for whatever that means

01:09:03.403 --> 01:09:10.337
in that brief moment, that you have scarred the
individual in some degree for possibly the rest of time.

01:09:10.337 --> 01:09:15.300
SAM: Do we know anything about how it can be
reversed or undone?

01:09:15.300 --> 01:09:20.964
MATT: No, you have no idea. You've heard of it in
stories. And as far as you know, it was mainly a

01:09:20.964 --> 01:09:25.560
folklore element, and you're like okay, no, I've
kind of heard of this. So if there was anything, this

01:09:25.560 --> 01:09:27.508
might be it.

01:09:27.508 --> 01:09:35.085
LIAM: I worry about her intentions with this
thing. Help me remember. When Pike has spoken to

01:09:35.085 --> 01:09:39.501
dead things, they cannot lie.

01:09:39.501 --> 01:09:41.093
TALIESIN: That's true.

01:09:41.093 --> 01:09:49.429
LIAM: So she wants to talk to Thordak's spirit.
Who presumably cannot lie, right?

01:09:49.429 --> 01:09:50.765
TALIESIN: Yes.

01:09:50.765 --> 01:09:56.600
LIAM: Which could mean the cure to this disease.
But it could mean something to do with that thing.

01:09:56.600 --> 01:10:06.952
TALIESIN: It could. It also, and this is a third
option. (sighs) Thordak could have tasked her with

01:10:06.952 --> 01:10:15.638
bringing us to him in a way that he feels
comfortable with, and only then will he cure her.

01:10:15.638 --> 01:10:18.659
I believe he holds the cure as sway.

01:10:18.659 --> 01:10:20.999
MARISHA: This whole thing could be an entire
trap.

01:10:20.999 --> 01:10:25.301
TALIESIN: Which means that we do have an ally for
defeating the white dragon.

01:10:25.301 --> 01:10:27.262
SAM and TALIESIN: And should use it.

01:10:27.262 --> 01:10:28.765
SAM: But then right after.

01:10:28.765 --> 01:10:31.769
TALIESIN: Well, if the opportunity presents
itself.

01:10:31.769 --> 01:10:33.285
SAM: Or shake her.

01:10:33.285 --> 01:10:38.090
TALIESIN: If the opportunity presents itself to
kill her there, in a way that is fitting and where

01:10:38.090 --> 01:10:40.204
we have advantage, then yes.

01:10:40.204 --> 01:10:41.777
LIAM: Away from this city.

01:10:41.777 --> 01:10:43.399
TALIESIN: In Draconia.

01:10:43.399 --> 01:10:51.827
LAURA: We never mentioned J'mon Sa Ord when we got
back, so Asum does not know about that, or Raishan

01:10:51.827 --> 01:10:53.500
doesn't know about that.

01:10:53.500 --> 01:10:55.150
MARISHA: Unless she was scrying on us, which is
highly possible.

01:10:55.150 --> 01:10:56.416
TALIESIN: Which is highly possible.

01:10:56.416 --> 01:10:59.632
LAURA: Do we have no way of having knowledge of
when someone scries on us? They can do it.

01:10:59.632 --> 01:11:02.009
TALIESIN: Sometimes we can notice, but often--

01:11:02.009 --> 01:11:06.118
MARISHA: I would have to have a super high
perception in order to maybe sense it?

01:11:06.118 --> 01:11:11.256
MATT: If someone were to scry on you and you were
to succeed on your saving throw, they would fail

01:11:11.256 --> 01:11:15.504
to scry, and you'd have some sort of inkling that
something weird is going on. If you are a person

01:11:15.504 --> 01:11:21.157
who's capable of casting the spell like you are,
you would be like, "Okay, someone's trying to peer

01:11:21.157 --> 01:11:22.393
"through the veil."

01:11:22.393 --> 01:11:26.099
LAURA: So you would know. She would know if
someone was trying to scry on us.

01:11:26.099 --> 01:11:27.238
MATT: Unless she--

01:11:27.238 --> 01:11:30.231
SAM and MATT: If she picked up on it.

01:11:30.231 --> 01:11:33.030
MATT: You have no recollection of that happening.

01:11:33.030 --> 01:11:36.678
MARISHA: Is there a way I can start looking out
for that?

01:11:36.678 --> 01:11:43.773
MATT: You can be very conscious of that
possibility and keen on intercepting should

01:11:43.773 --> 01:11:45.174
anything like that occur, sure.

01:11:45.174 --> 01:11:48.820
TALIESIN: The other thing that can happen is we
can set different forms of attack when we finally

01:11:48.820 --> 01:11:54.249
go against Thordak so that we have our mode of
entry and the way that we are going to be moving

01:11:54.249 --> 01:12:00.328
that attack forward and make sure we have
secondary lines of attack that she will have no

01:12:00.328 --> 01:12:02.729
knowledge of, that we will keep separated from
her.

01:12:02.729 --> 01:12:08.520
SAM: Is there any way to move Whitestone, to
reinforce Whitestone, to get something here to

01:12:08.520 --> 01:12:09.869
protect Whitestone?

01:12:09.869 --> 01:12:14.407
TALIESIN: A bit. But not a lot. There's just not
enough time.

01:12:14.407 --> 01:12:17.157
TRAVIS: How many Vestiges are left?

01:12:17.157 --> 01:12:20.780
LIAM and LAURA: Two?

01:12:20.780 --> 01:12:22.472
TALIESIN: That we know of.

01:12:22.472 --> 01:12:26.890
LAURA: Speaking of Vestige, this is part of the
plan. So?

01:12:26.890 --> 01:12:32.232
MARISHA: The Spire of Conflux was born from
Melora, so I'm wondering--

01:12:32.232 --> 01:12:37.058
LAURA: (gasps) The Spire of Conflux. That's why
we've heard of her!

01:12:37.058 --> 01:12:38.117
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:12:38.117 --> 01:12:39.196
LAURA: Shit!

01:12:39.196 --> 01:12:43.947
MARISHA: Oh, I've been thinking about that staff
for a while. I'm wondering if I can get to the

01:12:43.947 --> 01:12:49.878
staff quick enough, it could be the key to really
defeating Raishan.

01:12:49.878 --> 01:12:53.329
LAURA: It's resting in the belly of a terrible
beast in the Abyss, right?

01:12:53.329 --> 01:12:54.407
MARISHA: Correct.

01:12:54.407 --> 01:12:56.109
LAURA: So. Gate scroll.

01:12:56.109 --> 01:12:59.562
MARISHA: And Vorugal loves something to hunt.

01:12:59.562 --> 01:13:06.439
LAURA: What if we bring it through, let it fight
Vorugal, kill Vorugal, get the staff--

01:13:06.439 --> 01:13:11.882
MARISHA: Kill Raishan. I like this plan.

01:13:11.882 --> 01:13:14.232
LAURA: Not like anything could go wrong with it
but--

01:13:14.232 --> 01:13:19.130
TALIESIN: It's a good start. It's brazen. I like
it.

01:13:19.130 --> 01:13:23.270
SAM: (sighs)

01:13:23.270 --> 01:13:24.417
TRAVIS: Yes?

01:13:24.417 --> 01:13:25.994
TALIESIN: There's no easy way to do this.

01:13:25.994 --> 01:13:29.483
SAM: We don't know what that thing is that has--
what the beast is.

01:13:29.483 --> 01:13:33.799
MARISHA: Apparently, it's a goristro. A goristro?

01:13:33.799 --> 01:13:35.411
TALIESIN: Can I make a history check?

01:13:35.411 --> 01:13:37.051
MARISHA: It's a barista?

01:13:37.051 --> 01:13:40.265
TALIESIN: There's no defeating a barista.

01:13:40.265 --> 01:13:44.179
MARISHA: And she's really angry, because it's fall
time. Pumpkin spice lattes.

01:13:44.179 --> 01:13:46.805
MATT: No, I'd say this would be a religion check.

01:13:46.805 --> 01:13:50.137
TALIESIN: Not history, it'd be religion?

01:13:50.137 --> 01:13:51.366
TRAVIS: I got this.

01:13:51.366 --> 01:13:52.803
MARISHA: On what a goristro is?

01:13:52.803 --> 01:13:58.110
MATT: Let me double-check just to be sure.
Specifically, this is knowledge of fiends is what

01:13:58.110 --> 01:13:59.230
this is.

01:13:59.230 --> 01:14:04.141
MARISHA: Apparently, his name was Yenk. Yank?

01:14:04.141 --> 01:14:06.303
MATT: Yenk. Y-E-N-K.

01:14:06.303 --> 01:14:07.734
MARISHA and LAURA: Yenk.

01:14:07.734 --> 01:14:09.320
TRAVIS: All those yanks.

01:14:09.320 --> 01:14:14.800
TALIESIN: One day, there will be a creature whose
name we don't make fun of.

01:14:14.800 --> 01:14:18.632
LIAM and TALIESIN: Not this day!

01:14:18.632 --> 01:14:24.329
MATT: And every creature you make fun of is going
to hurt that much more when it kills you.

01:14:24.329 --> 01:14:28.104
TALIESIN: We are the Peter Parker of this game. We
walk around mocking things.

01:14:28.104 --> 01:14:30.585
MATT: It's great. It's so wonderful.

01:14:30.585 --> 01:14:34.283
TALIESIN: There's like this seventh ring of hell
where they're all hanging out going, "And then

01:14:34.283 --> 01:14:35.984
"they called me Purvan."

01:14:35.984 --> 01:14:40.027
LIAM: "It's pronounced 'Purvin.' That's so much
better."

01:14:40.027 --> 01:14:43.372
TALIESIN: "I was named after my grandfather,
man."

01:14:43.372 --> 01:14:49.919
MATT: I'd say honestly, like I might give a
religion check or a straight intelligence check.

01:14:49.919 --> 01:14:55.134
It's going to be a hard DC for anybody that doesn't
have any specific knowledge or training in

01:14:55.134 --> 01:14:56.627
anything fiend-centric.

01:14:56.627 --> 01:14:58.479
MARISHA: In anything fiend-centric?

01:14:58.479 --> 01:15:02.877
MATT: A goristro is a fiend. It lives in the
Abyss. Most things in the abyss are fiends.

01:15:02.877 --> 01:15:05.653
SAM: You said religion?

01:15:05.653 --> 01:15:11.700
MATT: I said possibly religion, if you have it
trained. If you're proficient in religion.

01:15:11.700 --> 01:15:13.517
LAURA: Can Pike--

01:15:13.517 --> 01:15:15.679
MATT: You can go ask her.

01:15:15.679 --> 01:15:18.220
MARISHA: She's here.

01:15:18.220 --> 01:15:21.963
TALIESIN: I'll send one of the guards to go bring
her in.

01:15:21.963 --> 01:15:26.754
MATT: You wait about an hour. Pike quickly jogs
up. You hear the clanking of the armor as she

01:15:26.754 --> 01:15:32.156
ascends the steps. "Hey, guys! Hi! What do you
need?"

01:15:32.156 --> 01:15:34.365
TRAVIS: Barely heard you coming that time.

01:15:34.365 --> 01:15:38.224
MATT: "Oh, thank you, Grog."

01:15:38.224 --> 01:15:44.914
LAURA: Pike, have you ever heard of a goristro
named Yenk?

01:15:44.914 --> 01:15:51.176
MATT: "No?"

01:15:51.176 --> 01:15:56.824
LAURA: Nothing? It's a fiend in the Abyss.
Anything about a goristro?

01:15:56.824 --> 01:16:01.194
MATT: "Fiends are bad, but I don't know anything
about a goristro."

01:16:01.194 --> 01:16:03.859
LAURA: At least you know how to pronounce it.

01:16:03.859 --> 01:16:12.571
TALIESIN: Do we have a library to consult?

01:16:12.571 --> 01:16:17.009
TRAVIS: What would be wrong with summoning it?
What if it's really bad?

01:16:17.009 --> 01:16:23.071
TALIESIN: I think it's a great idea. The worst
thing that happens is it's going to have to fight

01:16:23.071 --> 01:16:24.242
two dragons.

01:16:24.242 --> 01:16:28.055
SAM: It's a cool idea, but I don't think we can.
We need to know the beast that we are summoning.

01:16:28.055 --> 01:16:29.805
TALIESIN: We have its name.

01:16:29.805 --> 01:16:34.427
MARISHA: Yeah, we know what it is. Can we go to a
library, find a picture?

01:16:34.427 --> 01:16:36.199
LIAM: Maybe Allura knows.

01:16:36.199 --> 01:16:42.134
LAURA: Where is Allura? We haven't seen her in
forever. She's out--

01:16:42.134 --> 01:16:43.704
SAM: She's a dragon.

01:16:43.704 --> 01:16:45.816
TALIESIN: They can't all be dragons!

01:16:45.816 --> 01:16:49.673
TRAVIS: I have something to confess. I farted.

01:16:49.673 --> 01:16:50.992
LAURA: Just now?

01:16:50.992 --> 01:16:52.024
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:16:52.024 --> 01:16:59.725
TALIESIN: Does the little black orb absorb that?
And suddenly the demon-portal-hell opens.

01:16:59.725 --> 01:17:01.213
"Oh, that's all it took!"

01:17:01.213 --> 01:17:04.683
(laughter)

01:17:04.683 --> 01:17:11.562
MATT: What do you guys want to do?

01:17:11.562 --> 01:17:14.303
TALIESIN: I'm going to go research.

01:17:14.303 --> 01:17:16.518
LAURA: Yeah, can we go in the library and look in
the books there?

01:17:16.518 --> 01:17:22.391
MATT: Sure. Okay. Who's going to the library?
Okay, those two. What's everyone else doing?

01:17:22.391 --> 01:17:24.217
LIAM: I need to talk to you for a minute.

01:17:24.217 --> 01:17:28.202
MARISHA: Okay. I stare blankly into space.

01:17:28.202 --> 01:17:38.778
MATT: Okay, roll for perception. No. 
Grog, Scanlan, what are you guys doing?

01:17:38.778 --> 01:17:40.871
SAM: Nothing for us to do.

01:17:40.871 --> 01:17:44.329
TRAVIS: What are you talking about? We're the
masterminds of this portion of the adventure.

01:17:44.329 --> 01:17:47.381
SAM: You're right. What do you want to do?

01:17:47.381 --> 01:17:49.844
TRAVIS: I've got nothing.

01:17:49.844 --> 01:17:58.933
LAURA: Is there somebody religious, outside of
Pike, in the city? Oh yeah, ask Kash!

01:17:58.933 --> 01:18:03.966
MATT: Kash is in Vasselheim right now.

01:18:03.966 --> 01:18:06.171
TALIESIN: But we do have priests. We have two
priests.

01:18:06.171 --> 01:18:08.234
MATT: You have Keeper Yennen.

01:18:08.234 --> 01:18:11.751
TRAVIS: Yeah, ask him about a giant fiend-beast.
I'm sure they know all about it.

01:18:11.751 --> 01:18:16.362
SAM: All right, Grog and I will go talk to Keeper
Yennen about Yenk.

01:18:16.362 --> 01:18:17.307
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:18:17.307 --> 01:18:21.513
TALIESIN: You could also always pray to the Raven
Queen.

01:18:21.513 --> 01:18:23.939
LAURA: Oh yeah, you do have a shrine, after all.

01:18:23.939 --> 01:18:30.468
MATT: We'll go with your guys' conversation first.
Vax and Keyleth.

01:18:30.468 --> 01:18:45.158
LIAM: Come on, that's a good idea. Let's go to the
temple. I've been thinking a lot about your longer

01:18:45.158 --> 01:18:52.786
life that you told me about. Once you're leading
your people, you've come into your own, yeah?

01:18:52.786 --> 01:18:57.508
MARISHA: If I live past killing these dragons,
yeah.

01:18:57.508 --> 01:19:08.157
LIAM: A thousand years or so, yeah? Now, I've
thought a lot about that, and I think we should

01:19:08.157 --> 01:19:19.448
make a point of seeing that it happens. Well, once
you come out the other side of this. I want that

01:19:19.448 --> 01:19:21.218
for you.

01:19:21.218 --> 01:19:33.643
MARISHA: What do &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; want? I have a born duty to
my people that's hard to escape.

01:19:33.643 --> 01:19:39.415
LIAM: Well, if we're all alive in a month, we can
work that out.

01:19:39.415 --> 01:19:43.011
MARISHA: I guess we'll cross that bridge when we
get there.

01:19:43.011 --> 01:19:55.384
LIAM: In the meantime, I want you to have this.
And I undo my cloak and shove it into her hands.

01:19:55.384 --> 01:19:58.269
MARISHA: (whispers) Which cloak?

01:19:58.269 --> 01:20:01.940
LIAM: I only have one. Made from the--

01:20:01.940 --> 01:20:05.459
MARISHA: Oh, the displacer cloak.

01:20:05.459 --> 01:20:12.148
LIAM: I'm so used to you smashing across our
enemies, shoulder-to-shoulder with Grog, I get

01:20:12.148 --> 01:20:21.429
complacent. You're so strong. I know that. So much
more powerful than I am. Lulled me into a false

01:20:21.429 --> 01:20:32.372
sense of security. But I can't have you gone. I
need you here, so anything we can do to stack the

01:20:32.372 --> 01:20:46.343
deck in your favor. When you fell yesterday, it
shook me.

01:20:46.343 --> 01:20:52.266
MARISHA: Seems to be a trend, watching all of us
fall.

01:20:52.266 --> 01:20:56.984
LIAM: Kiki, will you wear that?

01:20:56.984 --> 01:21:10.515
MATT: You'll have to attune to it on a short rest,
but you can do that. While you guys are doing

01:21:10.515 --> 01:21:15.867
that, Percy and Vex, could you guys roll an
investigation check, each of you? Percy, minus

01:21:15.867 --> 01:21:19.300
three, because you're still suffering resurrection
issues.

01:21:19.300 --> 01:21:26.570
LAURA: Investigation? Oh! No, this has nothing to
do with dragons.

01:21:26.570 --> 01:21:30.462
SAM: It's okay. You're fine.

01:21:30.462 --> 01:21:32.314
LAURA: Ten.

01:21:32.314 --> 01:21:33.615
TALIESIN: I did.

01:21:33.615 --> 01:21:36.861
LAURA: Did you get a 20? Does it still count as a
20?

01:21:36.861 --> 01:21:39.101
TALIESIN: Yeah, a 20's a 20.

01:21:39.101 --> 01:21:41.409
MATT: It's still minus three. What's your total?

01:21:41.409 --> 01:21:47.604
TALIESIN: Investigation? 21, after that minus
three. But this is a natural 20.

01:21:47.604 --> 01:21:57.724
MATT: And ten? All righty. You guys spend the
better part of the next two hours or so poring

01:21:57.724 --> 01:22:00.978
through the various libraries. You know them very
well. You've read through a lot of these growing

01:22:00.978 --> 01:22:08.904
up. There aren't a lot of tomes or books that deal
with anything terribly fiendish. You do find one

01:22:08.904 --> 01:22:20.104
that deals with tales of the Betrayer Gods. It's
more of an old history tome that deals with

01:22:20.104 --> 01:22:26.555
pre-Divergence. It deals with the Founding, which
is the first era; the Age of Arcanum, which is the

01:22:26.555 --> 01:22:36.300
second era; this is all pre-Divergence. It speaks
of the Betrayer Gods and many of their creations

01:22:36.300 --> 01:22:44.354
and their followers that began to lay waste to
civilization and began to enslave the creators of

01:22:44.354 --> 01:22:47.153
those that remained on the side of light.

01:22:47.153 --> 01:23:02.478
You do see mention in there of various fiends and
demons and princes of evil. It's all very thick

01:23:02.478 --> 01:23:12.521
religious text, but there is one page that has
artwork on it. Sketched and simple, but it shows

01:23:12.521 --> 01:23:21.102
this strange, almost long, lithe vulture-like
creature, with wings and clawed hands, and a

01:23:21.102 --> 01:23:34.157
beak-like mouth, called a vrock. You see another
section that has a woman, but the lower half of

01:23:34.157 --> 01:23:41.527
her body is serpentine, like a snake, and she has
six arms carrying six different blades. It says

01:23:41.527 --> 01:23:49.902
"marilith." Behind them, you see a looming
creature of hulking fur and muscle with fists like

01:23:49.902 --> 01:23:59.351
battering rams, a turned up, pug-like nose with a
toothy jaw, and giant horns adorned with brass

01:23:59.351 --> 01:24:04.223
rings that curve forward. Under that it says
"goristro."

01:24:04.223 --> 01:24:05.609
LAURA: Did you find it?

01:24:05.609 --> 01:24:09.251
TALIESIN: Well, that's intimidating.

01:24:09.251 --> 01:24:12.031
LAURA: That's enormous.

01:24:12.031 --> 01:24:17.587
TALIESIN: Yes. I think the dragon will be
pleased.

01:24:17.587 --> 01:24:19.723
LAURA: I hope the dragon kills it.

01:24:19.723 --> 01:24:21.327
TALIESIN: I'm fine either way.

01:24:21.327 --> 01:24:24.665
LAURA: Well, that's helpful.

01:24:24.665 --> 01:24:29.500
TALIESIN: It's very helpful. Whoever survives--

01:24:29.500 --> 01:24:47.378
LAURA: We kill them. No problem. Anyway! And I
leave. We should probably show everybody what we found.

01:24:47.378 --> 01:24:58.988
LIAM: It feels really third-grade in here, all of
a sudden.

01:24:58.988 --> 01:25:03.474
MATT: The awkward pause dissipates, and you both
bumble your way out of the library to find the others.

01:25:03.474 --> 01:25:05.763
TALIESIN: We both go out the door at the same
time.

01:25:05.763 --> 01:25:07.136
LAURA: No, you first--

01:25:07.136 --> 01:25:08.333
TALIESIN: Please--

01:25:08.333 --> 01:25:15.146
MATT: Grog, Scanlan, you guys make your way over
to--

01:25:15.146 --> 01:25:19.999
SAM: We are the worst people for this mission.

01:25:19.999 --> 01:25:21.416
TRAVIS: We've got this on lock!

01:25:21.416 --> 01:25:32.614
MATT: There's Keeper Yennen there with his small
temple to Erathis, I believe. There's nobody in

01:25:32.614 --> 01:25:40.059
there, currently. It's empty. He's sweeping up
with one of his assistants that's helping keep the

01:25:40.059 --> 01:25:41.765
place clean.

01:25:41.765 --> 01:25:45.035
SAM: Tally-ho, Keeper Yennen.

01:25:45.035 --> 01:25:49.582
MATT: "It's been some time. I'm glad to see that
you're all safe and sound."

01:25:49.582 --> 01:25:57.349
SAM: Yes, well. We come seeking knowledge that
only you have. Maybe.

01:25:57.349 --> 01:26:01.053
MATT: "Well, I am at your service. What can I
do?"

01:26:01.053 --> 01:26:07.843
SAM: We needed some information about something
that is beyond our scope.

01:26:07.843 --> 01:26:14.056
TRAVIS: Wait. I don't know if he's cool, man.
Maybe you should check him.

01:26:14.056 --> 01:26:19.654
SAM: Check him? All right. I'll check him.

01:26:19.654 --> 01:26:21.636
MATT: "What?"

01:26:21.636 --> 01:26:24.426
TRAVIS: Yennen, you keep your hands where I can
see them.

01:26:24.426 --> 01:26:25.952
MATT: "This is very--"

01:26:25.952 --> 01:26:28.117
TRAVIS: Just keep them where I can see them.

01:26:28.117 --> 01:26:30.838
MATT: He's got the broom in front.

01:26:30.838 --> 01:26:34.311
SAM: I'm going to slowly touch his arms, make sure
he's real.

01:26:34.311 --> 01:26:39.966
MATT: Your hands meet cloth and somewhat wrinkled
older gentleman skin.

01:26:39.966 --> 01:26:41.698
SAM: I'll pat him down.

01:26:41.698 --> 01:26:43.575
MATT: Make an investigation check.

01:26:43.575 --> 01:26:46.634
SAM: 19.

01:26:46.634 --> 01:26:52.474
MATT: You find a small pouch, seems to contain a
few coins. A somewhat stale piece of half-eaten

01:26:52.474 --> 01:26:59.733
bread. A couple of unlit candles. That's about
it.

01:26:59.733 --> 01:27:03.535
SAM: I sniff the bread. (sniffing) He's clean.

01:27:03.535 --> 01:27:07.443
TRAVIS: All right. As you were.

01:27:07.443 --> 01:27:10.709
MATT: "Most unusual."

01:27:10.709 --> 01:27:12.580
TRAVIS: Don't worry. Can't be too careful.

01:27:12.580 --> 01:27:13.987
SAM: There's dragons around.

01:27:13.987 --> 01:27:18.013
MATT: "Right, right. That's all right." He picks
the bread up off the ground and puts it back in

01:27:18.013 --> 01:27:19.089
his pocket.

01:27:19.089 --> 01:27:20.572
SAM: Sorry about that.

01:27:20.572 --> 01:27:29.297
TRAVIS: We're actually hoping you have some
information on a fiendish beast named Lucas.

01:27:29.297 --> 01:27:30.503
SAM: Nope.

01:27:30.503 --> 01:27:34.550
TRAVIS: Named Victor.

01:27:34.550 --> 01:27:43.366
SAM: Yenk. Yenk. And he is a-- what's the type of
beast? A goristro.

01:27:43.366 --> 01:27:53.723
MATT: "I have come across texts that speak of a
goristro. I do not know of one named Yenk,

01:27:53.723 --> 01:27:55.413
"specifically."

01:27:55.413 --> 01:28:03.492
SAM: Well, it's very important that we know his
name-- or her name-- accurately, because, well,

01:28:03.492 --> 01:28:09.342
for many reasons. But we need to know its true
name. Is there any text you can point us to?

01:28:09.342 --> 01:28:12.722
TRAVIS: Or tell us what you know of goristros.

01:28:12.722 --> 01:28:23.868
MATT: "They were dangerous front-line behemoths
when the fiends attacked these lands, back in the

01:28:23.868 --> 01:28:31.807
"pre-Divergence era. They were 20-plus feet tall
and living battering rams that tore through stone

01:28:31.807 --> 01:28:33.994
"like it was paper."

01:28:33.994 --> 01:28:40.576
SAM: Force is their weapon, not fire or any
magic?

01:28:40.576 --> 01:28:53.502
MATT: "I don't know the specifics, but the texts I
have read speak of it being an unstoppable fist in

01:28:53.502 --> 01:28:56.905
"the service of the Dark Princes."

01:28:56.905 --> 01:29:00.975
TRAVIS: Right, now, we are totally up to date on
how to fight these things, but we are also part of

01:29:00.975 --> 01:29:08.506
a group that's making sure you are at your best in
case they come round here. If I were to ask you

01:29:08.506 --> 01:29:11.237
how to fight one of these things, what would you
bring?

01:29:11.237 --> 01:29:16.514
MATT: "Everything?"

01:29:16.514 --> 01:29:19.238
(laughter)

01:29:19.238 --> 01:29:26.176
TRAVIS: An interesting answer. Might you be a
little less vague for my simple friend here?

01:29:26.176 --> 01:29:29.211
SAM: Do they have any resistances? Acid, poison,
fire?

01:29:29.211 --> 01:29:38.344
MATT: "I have no idea, unfortunately. I'm not
extremely well versed in fiendish things. I know a

01:29:38.344 --> 01:29:43.033
"bit offhand from my teachings, but it's a very
specific--"

01:29:43.033 --> 01:29:48.718
TRAVIS: I expected more, really. I did.

01:29:48.718 --> 01:29:52.564
SAM: Are we going to play bad Grog, good gnome?

01:29:52.564 --> 01:29:56.698
TRAVIS: I don't even know if it's worth it, at
this point. I expected more.

01:29:56.698 --> 01:29:59.924
SAM: Oh, you're going to guilt it out of him.

01:29:59.924 --> 01:30:03.407
MATT: "I'm not withholding any information. I
genuinely--"

01:30:03.407 --> 01:30:09.979
TRAVIS: You want to protect Whitestone, right? See
its people to prosperity?

01:30:09.979 --> 01:30:11.848
MATT: "That's what I'm doing."

01:30:11.848 --> 01:30:14.906
TRAVIS: All right, then, maybe you should &lt;i&gt;learn
more about hellish fiends!&lt;/i&gt;

01:30:14.906 --> 01:30:17.473
MATT: "We've rebuilt half the city--"

01:30:17.473 --> 01:30:22.681
SAM: (voice breaking) Grog, I don't think I can--
I'm emotional thinking of all the people in

01:30:22.681 --> 01:30:24.680
Whitestone who are going to die.

01:30:24.680 --> 01:30:26.012
TRAVIS: Look what you've done.

01:30:26.012 --> 01:30:30.903
SAM: I can't keep it together. Is there any
information you might know that can save your

01:30:30.903 --> 01:30:32.365
people?

01:30:32.365 --> 01:30:39.906
MATT: (strained) "I don't know!" And he rushes off
toward his room. You start hearing him turning

01:30:39.961 --> 01:30:44.196
over blankets, things tumbling onto the ground.
He's tearing through his room in the back of the

01:30:44.196 --> 01:30:45.229
temple.

01:30:45.229 --> 01:30:46.988
TRAVIS: Well done. You've got to lick your fingers
and then wet--

01:30:46.988 --> 01:30:49.033
SAM: Oh, good, yeah. Ooh.

01:30:49.033 --> 01:30:56.143
MATT: About ten minutes go by before he comes out,
sweat pouring down his face. He's like, (panting)

01:30:56.143 --> 01:30:59.795
"I have nothing. I'm sorry."

01:30:59.795 --> 01:31:10.188
TRAVIS: It's all right. We all have room to
improve. I suppose we know now where yours lies.

01:31:10.188 --> 01:31:17.027
You have your orders. Don't make me tell Percy
about this.

01:31:17.027 --> 01:31:19.061
MATT: Make an intimidation check.

01:31:19.061 --> 01:31:22.516
LIAM: That guy's going to go back to his room and
flagellate himself.

01:31:22.516 --> 01:31:25.403
SAM: We're shaking down our friend.

01:31:25.403 --> 01:31:27.093
TRAVIS: 24.

01:31:27.093 --> 01:31:36.794
MATT: He goes, "Yes, right, of course. I will
further my research, and perhaps I could send

01:31:36.794 --> 01:31:44.482
"someone to scour the rubble of the Cobalt Reserve.
It may take a couple weeks. I'm so sorry."

01:31:44.482 --> 01:31:49.510
TRAVIS: Not a bad idea. You've done lovely work in
here, by the way. The rebuilding effort looks great.

01:31:49.510 --> 01:31:50.891
MATT: "Thank you."

01:31:50.891 --> 01:31:53.507
TRAVIS: I'd like to see that passion in the rest
of your projects, that's all.

01:31:53.507 --> 01:31:57.994
SAM: Is there anyone else who has knowledge that
you can think of that we should speak to?

01:31:57.994 --> 01:32:02.268
MATT: "Not that still lives in the city,
unfortunately. You're in the service of the

01:32:02.268 --> 01:32:09.121
"greatest minds of our city now, up in the castle.
We're trying to put homes up for those who need them."

01:32:09.121 --> 01:32:10.472
TRAVIS: Shit.

01:32:10.472 --> 01:32:11.593
LAURA: Yeah.

01:32:11.593 --> 01:32:13.815
SAM: Thank you for your service to Whitestone.

01:32:13.815 --> 01:32:16.346
MATT: "Also, thank you for yours."

01:32:16.346 --> 01:32:21.160
SAM: We've had a weird, rough week, so sorry if
we--

01:32:21.160 --> 01:32:23.191
MATT: "Apparently, now so have I."

01:32:23.191 --> 01:32:31.532
TRAVIS: Just curious, do you need any money for
these homes? Or anything?

01:32:31.532 --> 01:32:34.144
MATT: "Cassandra's taking care of the costs."

01:32:34.144 --> 01:32:35.765
TRAVIS: Right. Shit.

01:32:35.765 --> 01:32:39.818
MATT: "She's sending up materials from the Turst
Fields."

01:32:39.818 --> 01:32:44.677
TRAVIS: You should know, we've been taking surveys
around the town, like, "A, B, C, people most

01:32:44.677 --> 01:32:49.892
"important in the rebuilding of Whitestone," and
role models, and you're always the first name.

01:32:49.892 --> 01:32:51.312
Isn't that right, Scanlan?

01:32:51.312 --> 01:32:53.630
SAM: I don't think we can talk our way out of this
one.

01:32:53.630 --> 01:32:57.760
TRAVIS: I'm just trying to make him feel better.
It's you.

01:32:57.760 --> 01:32:59.421
SAM: You're top five in Whitestone, for sure.

01:32:59.421 --> 01:33:05.169
MATT: "I appreciate-- It's very kind."

01:33:05.169 --> 01:33:08.211
TRAVIS: You're doing good work. (strained) All
right.

01:33:08.211 --> 01:33:10.773
MATT: "I have a lot of sweeping to do, if you
don't mind."

01:33:10.773 --> 01:33:17.035
SAM: We did a good thing in there, Grog.

01:33:17.035 --> 01:33:25.897
MATT: The assistant is over there wide-eyed,
watching this whole circumstance. He's a young,

01:33:25.897 --> 01:33:31.529
maybe 17-year-old boy in a similar robe.
"Sebastian, stop staring and help me clean!"

01:33:31.529 --> 01:33:35.715
"Yes, sir!" They both start sweeping the rest of
the temple as you guys walk out.

01:33:35.715 --> 01:33:38.003
SAM: He's going to kill you someday.

01:33:38.003 --> 01:33:40.248
TRAVIS: We clearly got the most info out of
anybody.

01:33:40.248 --> 01:33:43.810
SAM: I think we got all there was. High-five.

01:33:43.810 --> 01:33:48.903
MATT: All right. The two of you finally make your
way to the recently constructed temple of the

01:33:48.903 --> 01:33:52.604
Raven Queen that Percy had built. What would you
like to do?

01:33:52.604 --> 01:33:56.237
LIAM: I want to go in and have a moment. Pray.

01:33:56.237 --> 01:33:58.085
MATT: Okay.

01:33:58.085 --> 01:34:09.412
LIAM: So I will go in and kneel down where
Percival showed me and stay quiet for a few

01:34:09.412 --> 01:34:27.741
minutes, then ask a couple of questions. I haven't
spoken in a while. I'm trying to grow stronger.

01:34:27.741 --> 01:34:55.400
Whatever it is you need. Maybe it is selfish, but
I seek vengeance against my mother's killer. Once

01:34:55.400 --> 01:35:14.039
I have it, I will go to the ends of this world for
you. To help me go stronger, is there anything you

01:35:14.039 --> 01:35:25.475
can tell me about the fiend named Yenk? We need to
use it.

01:35:25.475 --> 01:35:30.114
MATT: Roll a religion check.

01:35:30.114 --> 01:35:34.069
LAURA: You can do it!

01:35:34.069 --> 01:35:40.158
LIAM: I will stick with that. No, I'll stick with
that. 21.

01:35:40.158 --> 01:35:49.889
MATT: 21. The door still left ajar to the temple
as Keyleth walked in earlier, a bit of a breeze

01:35:49.889 --> 01:35:56.437
swirls in for a second, carrying a few leaves.
They scatter around, come to rest. The candles

01:35:56.437 --> 01:36:06.754
flicker for a moment and the light dims ever so
slightly. Nothing beyond that from your

01:36:06.754 --> 01:36:16.197
perspective, Keyleth. You, Vax, feel a familiar
cold embrace. It's interesting. It's chilling and

01:36:16.197 --> 01:36:25.579
causes your skin to goosebump, but it's still
comforting. While you see nothing within your

01:36:25.579 --> 01:36:37.934
closed eyes, you can sense a pair of cold lips to
your left ear that whispers toward you, "Knowledge

01:36:37.934 --> 01:36:55.423
"of this is earned. You seek this with your allies.
Some have already found secrets. I can only say

01:36:55.423 --> 01:37:12.163
"that the path you walked to the sphinx gave you
what you need. Stay alive." You feel the lips fade

01:37:12.163 --> 01:37:18.473
from your ear. Warmth comes back to your sides,
and your eyes flicker open, knowing that her

01:37:18.473 --> 01:37:20.331
presence is no longer there.

01:37:20.331 --> 01:37:26.050
MARISHA: Any luck?

01:37:26.050 --> 01:37:34.751
LIAM: Sort of. She told me something, but I'm too
stupid to understand.

01:37:34.751 --> 01:37:44.543
MARISHA: I don't think that's true. Gods really
enjoy being vague. What'd she say?

01:37:44.543 --> 01:37:51.521
LIAM: She said that the path to the sphinx told us
everything we want to know.

01:37:51.521 --> 01:37:55.347
MARISHA: Which sphinx? We've seen two now.

01:37:55.347 --> 01:37:58.205
LIAM: She didn't say.

01:37:58.205 --> 01:38:01.323
MARISHA: Damn it. Why do they have to be so
cryptic?

01:38:01.323 --> 01:38:04.140
LIAM: Because they can.

01:38:04.140 --> 01:38:05.446
MARISHA: Ugh.

01:38:05.446 --> 01:38:10.015
LIAM: Come here. That's on crooked.

01:38:10.015 --> 01:38:17.115
MARISHA: I don't think I wear it as well as you.
It's a little baggy.

01:38:17.115 --> 01:38:24.340
LIAM: Here's to a thousand years of you.

01:38:24.340 --> 01:38:28.149
MARISHA: That made me a little nauseous. Let's
go.

01:38:28.149 --> 01:38:34.355
MATT: As you guys all go to convene in Castle
Whitestone to discuss the next length of your

01:38:34.355 --> 01:38:41.136
plan, we're going to take a restroom break. See
you guys back here in a few minutes. Thank you

01:38:41.136 --> 01:38:45.332
once again, Loot Crate, for being awesome, our
sponsor. Thank you guys for sticking around. See

01:38:45.332 --> 01:38:48.019
you guys in a minute.

01:38:48.019 --> 01:38:51.000
LAURA: "Is it Thursday yet?" Did you almost say
"Is it Thursday yet?"

01:38:51.000 --> 01:57:03.616
[break]

01:57:03.616 --> 01:57:08.836
MATT: Welcome back everybody from the break.
Before we get started, I wanted to bring this up

01:57:08.836 --> 01:57:14.082
in case you guys were not aware. I was made aware
of it at the end of last week, but they announced

01:57:14.082 --> 01:57:21.092
Twitch Prime. What that allows is for anybody out
there that has an Amazon Prime account you get

01:57:21.092 --> 01:57:25.786
automatically one free subscription to a Twitch
channel of your choice, so if you are not a

01:57:25.786 --> 01:57:29.395
subscriber to Geek and Sundry's Twitch, to help
support the show, and you have an Amazon Prime

01:57:29.395 --> 01:57:31.952
account, you can do that now, free of charge.

01:57:31.952 --> 01:57:34.292
TRAVIS: You'll be in the chat room; you'll get all
the goodies.

01:57:34.292 --> 01:57:37.234
MATT: All the goodies, you'll have access to the
VODs immediately. You won't have to wait until

01:57:37.234 --> 01:57:40.820
Monday for the YouTube videos to come out for the
episodes, and it is of no additional cost to you

01:57:40.820 --> 01:57:44.322
as long as you have a Prime membership. I wanted
to make sure you guys were aware of that, because

01:57:44.322 --> 01:57:45.932
I was recently made aware of that.

01:57:45.932 --> 01:57:55.458
All righty. Picking up where we left off, the rest
of you guys have done some research, gathered some

01:57:55.458 --> 01:58:00.701
information that may or may not be helpful. What
do you want to do for the rest of your preparation

01:58:00.701 --> 01:58:02.564
for whatever you wish to do going forward?

01:58:02.564 --> 01:58:03.875
LIAM: This is before beddy-bye time?

01:58:03.875 --> 01:58:05.095
MATT: Yeah, you guys are still--

01:58:05.095 --> 01:58:07.632
TALIESIN: I've a few things I think we should do.

01:58:07.632 --> 01:58:08.915
LAURA: Okay?

01:58:08.915 --> 01:58:10.575
MARISHA: I think there's a lot we need to do.

01:58:10.575 --> 01:58:12.573
TALIESIN: First, I think we should brew some tea
and not drink it.

01:58:12.573 --> 01:58:17.968
LAURA: Oh. It only lasts for how long?

01:58:17.968 --> 01:58:19.166
TRAVIS: What?

01:58:19.166 --> 01:58:20.846
LAURA: The venomous tea.

01:58:20.846 --> 01:58:22.873
MATT: It'll probably last for the day.

01:58:22.873 --> 01:58:24.992
LAURA: All right, yeah. It'll last for 24 hours.

01:58:24.992 --> 01:58:28.070
SAM: So wait, you want to make poison and not do
anything with it?

01:58:28.070 --> 01:58:29.437
LAURA: We'll keep it.

01:58:29.437 --> 01:58:30.473
MARISHA: Just in case.

01:58:30.473 --> 01:58:32.924
SAM: In case someone comes over for tea?

01:58:32.924 --> 01:58:33.862
MARISHA: Emergency poison.

01:58:33.862 --> 01:58:37.289
TRAVIS: Why wouldn't you make it in front of her,
and then it's &lt;i&gt;way&lt;/i&gt; less conspicuous.

01:58:37.289 --> 01:58:44.830
LAURA: (gasps) That's true! Let's make some and
put it a flask, and then we'll do it later.

01:58:44.830 --> 01:58:46.352
LIAM: Are you talking about for Raishan?

01:58:46.352 --> 01:58:47.903
TALIESIN: No, just to have some poison.

01:58:47.903 --> 01:58:49.182
LIAM: She's a poisonous dragon.

01:58:49.182 --> 01:58:51.133
LAURA: Just to have some poison in general. Not
necessarily for Raishan.

01:58:51.133 --> 01:58:52.727
TALIESIN: Maybe we'll make it in the morning.

01:58:52.727 --> 01:58:54.138
LIAM: Maybe an enemy will come over. You're
right.

01:58:54.138 --> 01:58:56.628
MARISHA: Maybe an enemy will come over.

01:58:56.628 --> 01:59:04.399
MATT: As a specific master of dragon and dragon
knowledge, so you're aware, green dragons are--

01:59:04.399 --> 01:59:06.297
LAURA: Poison.

01:59:06.297 --> 01:59:07.786
MATT: Poison by nature.

01:59:07.786 --> 01:59:09.153
LAURA: I don't think this is for Raishan!

01:59:09.153 --> 01:59:10.021
MATT: Okay.

01:59:10.021 --> 01:59:16.242
TALIESIN: I was actually thinking if we had a bit
of poison and if we could get it into the system

01:59:16.242 --> 01:59:19.261
of one of the larger creatures at some point. A
big pot of poison, maybe.

01:59:19.261 --> 01:59:22.255
LAURA: I knew you didn't think it was for
Raishan.

01:59:22.255 --> 01:59:25.076
TALIESIN: Raishan's not going to drink tea and
die.

01:59:25.076 --> 01:59:27.968
MARISHA: Right, internet? We knew it wasn't for
Raishan.

01:59:27.968 --> 01:59:30.283
MATT: (laughs) All right.

01:59:30.283 --> 01:59:37.500
TALIESIN: Yeah, I want to go downstairs, and I
want to see if Grog will give me all of the guns

01:59:37.500 --> 01:59:41.032
to go upstairs and look at our giant cache of guns
that we suddenly have.

01:59:41.032 --> 01:59:44.749
MARISHA and TALIESIN: All the guns.

01:59:44.749 --> 01:59:56.984
SAM: That reminds me. On the walk home with Grog,
I turn to him and say: Oi, Grog, got any of those guns?

01:59:56.984 --> 01:59:58.017
TRAVIS: I do!

01:59:58.017 --> 01:59:59.193
SAM: How many?

01:59:59.193 --> 02:00:06.965
TRAVIS: Two pistols, two rifles, really long
skinny guy. And I've got a greatsword.

02:00:06.965 --> 02:00:15.145
SAM: Why should Percy have all the fun? What say
you and me take a pistol each, just as a backup

02:00:15.145 --> 02:00:17.142
plan? An insurance policy.

02:00:17.142 --> 02:00:19.449
TRAVIS: I don't want a pistol. How about you take
one?

02:00:19.449 --> 02:00:21.978
SAM: You don't want a pistol?

02:00:21.978 --> 02:00:22.986
TRAVIS: No!

02:00:22.986 --> 02:00:24.667
SAM: You'd look so cool!

02:00:24.667 --> 02:00:26.452
TRAVIS: It's not as intimate as what I do.

02:00:26.452 --> 02:00:29.555
SAM: You are about the personal touch.

02:00:29.555 --> 02:00:30.942
TRAVIS: I need the connection.

02:00:30.942 --> 02:00:35.518
TALIESIN: What are the actual chances that he will
even know how to operate it? I'm not talking to

02:00:35.518 --> 02:00:39.612
either of you. I'm talking to the powers that be.

02:00:39.612 --> 02:00:44.782
TRAVIS: It'd be like a little GI Joe handgun. Do
you want a pistol?

02:00:44.782 --> 02:00:46.689
SAM: Do you have any ammo?

02:00:46.689 --> 02:00:50.275
TRAVIS: I do. I have 185 rounds.

02:00:50.275 --> 02:00:52.518
SAM: Holy shit!

02:00:52.518 --> 02:00:56.794
TRAVIS: So I take out one of the two pistols. Do
they look the same?

02:00:56.794 --> 02:00:58.933
MATT: They look comparable, yes.

02:00:58.933 --> 02:01:00.087
TRAVIS: Which one?

02:01:00.087 --> 02:01:03.298
SAM: Is there any blood on either of them?

02:01:03.298 --> 02:01:04.535
TRAVIS: Are there?

02:01:04.535 --> 02:01:06.500
MATT: A little smattering on each of them, yeah.

02:01:06.500 --> 02:01:08.113
TRAVIS: I'll give you the super bloody one.

02:01:08.113 --> 02:01:09.225
SAM: I want the bloody one.

02:01:09.225 --> 02:01:12.497
TRAVIS: Yeah! I toss it to him, and I give him--

02:01:12.497 --> 02:01:15.381
LAURA: Six ammo. (laughs)

02:01:15.381 --> 02:01:18.811
TRAVIS: (laughs) 15 rounds of ammo.

02:01:18.811 --> 02:01:26.528
SAM: Thank you, Grog. Thank you very much. I don't
know what to do with this, so I'll pocket it.

02:01:26.528 --> 02:01:30.023
TRAVIS: I'm pretty sure if you look into it--

02:01:30.023 --> 02:01:32.631
LAURA: Don't even encourage that--

02:01:32.631 --> 02:01:36.619
SAM: I've seen Percy do that a lot. Stares right
down the barrel and make sure it's working.

02:01:36.619 --> 02:01:39.055
TRAVIS: Yeah, that's where the expression comes
from: "right down the barrel."

02:01:39.055 --> 02:01:43.965
TALIESIN: Don't do that at home, kids. Just don't
do that.

02:01:43.965 --> 02:01:46.044
LAURA: Just don't.

02:01:46.044 --> 02:01:51.316
MATT: All right, so you go looking for Grog who is
not around the castle, and eventually, as you step

02:01:51.316 --> 02:01:55.026
out, you notice Scanlan and Grog both walking up
the pathway to the front of Whitestone Castle.

02:01:55.026 --> 02:01:58.890
TALIESIN: Oh good! We need to go through the guns,
we need to see what we have, we need to clean them

02:01:58.890 --> 02:02:00.782
up. I've got a plan.

02:02:00.782 --> 02:02:07.628
TRAVIS: Yeah, right, yeah. We need to-- (sniffs)
&lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; need to clean up the guns.

02:02:07.628 --> 02:02:09.519
TALIESIN: I do. I need to clean up the guns.

02:02:09.519 --> 02:02:12.646
TRAVIS: Who has those guns? &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt; have the guns.

02:02:12.646 --> 02:02:14.990
TALIESIN: You do. That's right; you were very
clever.

02:02:14.990 --> 02:02:16.483
TRAVIS: What you have?

02:02:16.483 --> 02:02:25.935
TALIESIN: I have a book. It's a very nice book.

02:02:25.935 --> 02:02:27.956
TRAVIS: Are you joking?

02:02:27.956 --> 02:02:30.651
TALIESIN: No! No, I have a cloak. Would you like a
cloak?

02:02:30.651 --> 02:02:31.925
TRAVIS: For what?

02:02:31.925 --> 02:02:35.152
TALIESIN: The guns. I thought we were making a
trade here.

02:02:35.152 --> 02:02:36.744
TRAVIS: Yeah, no, we are.

02:02:36.744 --> 02:02:38.497
TALIESIN: All right, do you want a cloak, then?

02:02:38.497 --> 02:02:39.950
LIAM: A Vestige?

02:02:39.950 --> 02:02:41.688
TALIESIN: No, I've just got a cloak.

02:02:41.688 --> 02:02:43.965
(laughter)

02:02:43.965 --> 02:02:44.895
TRAVIS: What does it do?

02:02:44.895 --> 02:02:47.438
TALIESIN: It looks smashing, and it's quite warm.

02:02:47.438 --> 02:02:48.818
TRAVIS: It's a cloak of smashing?

02:02:48.818 --> 02:02:50.475
TALIESIN: Yes, it is a cloak of smashing.

02:02:50.475 --> 02:02:55.126
TRAVIS: Deal. All right. I will trade you that for
the long barrel thing.

02:02:55.126 --> 02:02:56.524
TALIESIN: I'll need them all.

02:02:56.524 --> 02:02:57.777
TRAVIS: In a minute.

02:02:57.777 --> 02:02:59.962
TALIESIN: No, I need them all. I really don't have
anything else.

02:02:59.962 --> 02:03:02.009
SAM: You don't have any guns? What happened to
your guns?

02:03:02.009 --> 02:03:03.773
TALIESIN: Well, no. I need to clean--

02:03:03.773 --> 02:03:05.280
TRAVIS: What about your glasses?

02:03:05.280 --> 02:03:09.022
TALIESIN: (chuckles) I sort of need those
glasses--

02:03:09.022 --> 02:03:10.066
TRAVIS: Do you?

02:03:10.066 --> 02:03:11.125
TALIESIN: Yes.

02:03:11.125 --> 02:03:16.176
TRAVIS: Give me your glasses. Just let me hold
them. Show us some faith.

02:03:16.176 --> 02:03:19.330
SAM: We're friends here, right, Grog?

02:03:19.330 --> 02:03:21.948
TALIESIN: Is everybody here? Is everybody watching
us?

02:03:21.948 --> 02:03:25.985
MATT: Just the three of you guys and three guards
back by the front of the castle.

02:03:25.985 --> 02:03:30.976
SAM: I don't know what he's doing. I would not
trust him. But then again, you don't have a choice.

02:03:30.976 --> 02:03:34.659
TALIESIN: I don't trust him, either. I did have
siblings; I'm aware of how this happens.

02:03:34.659 --> 02:03:38.935
TRAVIS: How many fingers am I holding up?

02:03:38.935 --> 02:03:40.267
TALIESIN: Four.

02:03:40.267 --> 02:03:41.863
TRAVIS: Was he right?

02:03:41.863 --> 02:03:43.047
SAM: He was right!

02:03:43.047 --> 02:03:45.782
TRAVIS: I don't know why you need the glasses.

02:03:45.782 --> 02:03:48.475
TALIESIN: I need the glasses because I can't see
things that are up close. I can see things that

02:03:48.475 --> 02:03:50.153
are far away perfectly fine.

02:03:50.153 --> 02:03:54.693
TRAVIS: How many fingers am I holding up?

02:03:54.693 --> 02:03:56.130
TALIESIN: I don't know.

02:03:56.130 --> 02:03:57.286
TRAVIS: Is he right?

02:03:57.286 --> 02:03:58.369
SAM: He doesn't know.

02:03:58.369 --> 02:03:59.881
(laughter)

02:03:59.881 --> 02:04:04.867
TRAVIS: Very well. You passed. Glasses. And I give
him the two rifles.

02:04:04.867 --> 02:04:07.869
TALIESIN: He also has Ripley's gun?

02:04:07.869 --> 02:04:08.902
MATT: Yes.

02:04:08.902 --> 02:04:16.057
TALIESIN: Why don't we come inside so I can
explain to you my plan so that you can feel good--

02:04:16.057 --> 02:04:19.027
TRAVIS: No, this is very important for me out
here. I have a position of power, and I'm not

02:04:19.027 --> 02:04:23.019
about to give it up. What else have you got?

02:04:23.019 --> 02:04:27.748
TALIESIN: I have a title. I can title you.

02:04:27.748 --> 02:04:29.678
SAM: Oh, yes! Title him!

02:04:29.678 --> 02:04:32.316
TALIESIN: Would you like a title?

02:04:32.316 --> 02:04:36.455
TRAVIS: Take note, Scanlan: this is how you get
shit done. I'm listening.

02:04:36.455 --> 02:04:42.698
TALIESIN: All right, I will title you if you give
me everything that I need. I need all the

02:04:42.698 --> 02:04:48.188
ammunition, all the guns, especially the
complicated guns. I'm going to need everything.

02:04:48.188 --> 02:04:53.874
TRAVIS: Yeah, I have one other pistol, I have 170
rounds for the little bitty guy, and I've got 26

02:04:53.874 --> 02:04:56.228
rounds for the (belches) rifles.

02:04:56.228 --> 02:04:57.593
TALIESIN: All right.

02:04:57.593 --> 02:04:59.386
TRAVIS: Do you want the full plate armor and the
greatsword, too?

02:04:59.386 --> 02:05:02.036
TALIESIN: No, plate armor and greatsword are
completely up to you.

02:05:02.036 --> 02:05:06.253
TRAVIS: (belches) Okay. I give it all over. What's
my title?

02:05:06.253 --> 02:05:16.180
TALIESIN: Grand Poobah de Doink of All of This and
That.

02:05:16.180 --> 02:05:19.920
SAM: Grand Poobah de Doink of All of This and
That.

02:05:19.920 --> 02:05:26.039
TALIESIN: Of &lt;i&gt;All&lt;/i&gt; of This and That. It comes with
no money and no land, but it is a title.

02:05:26.039 --> 02:05:34.558
SAM: I'm unfamiliar with protocol. A Grand Poobah,
how do you address them? Is it a "your Majesty," a

02:05:34.558 --> 02:05:36.509
"your Highness," "your Grace?"

02:05:36.509 --> 02:05:39.068
TALIESIN: No it's "Hey you, over there." "Hey, you
guy."

02:05:39.068 --> 02:05:40.483
SAM: Hey, you guy.

02:05:40.483 --> 02:05:43.519
TRAVIS: Yes, my humble servants.

02:05:43.519 --> 02:05:45.736
TALIESIN: "Sweet chestnut."

02:05:45.736 --> 02:05:47.682
TRAVIS: Are those all official names?

02:05:47.682 --> 02:05:49.916
TALIESIN: Oh, yes. They're used in very different
ways.

02:05:49.916 --> 02:05:53.896
TRAVIS: Well look, let's keep it on the low-low,
right, I don't want too many people getting

02:05:53.896 --> 02:05:58.432
jealous, so like only in private quarters will you
address me by my &lt;i&gt;official&lt;/i&gt; title.

02:05:58.432 --> 02:06:00.597
TALIESIN: Okay, or the shortened versions
thereof.

02:06:00.597 --> 02:06:03.203
TRAVIS: Yeah, which I look forward to learning.

02:06:03.203 --> 02:06:06.348
TALIESIN: You will enjoy them. I'm sure we will
all enjoy them.

02:06:06.348 --> 02:06:07.841
SAM: This is a great day, Grog.

02:06:07.841 --> 02:06:13.962
TRAVIS: It is, right? Man, I just keep coming up
in the world. Coming up, against all the odds. I

02:06:13.962 --> 02:06:19.501
feel like an Eminem song in the background right
now. Eight Mile, bitches. Let's go inside.

02:06:19.501 --> 02:06:26.190
TALIESIN: Didn't even bother to insight check, did
you? That's great. That makes me so happy.

02:06:26.190 --> 02:06:30.542
SAM: Percy, don't forget, you promised me one
of those guns.

02:06:30.542 --> 02:06:33.863
TALIESIN: I'd actually have to teach you how to
use it, you are aware of that?

02:06:33.863 --> 02:06:38.175
SAM: Maybe you can teach me first, and when I've
learned, you can give me one.

02:06:38.175 --> 02:06:44.085
TALIESIN: Maybe we'll have that conversation. I'm
going to take a look at their various levels of

02:06:44.085 --> 02:06:48.506
repair. I want to take a look at how they look,
how many of them need work, how many of them are

02:06:48.506 --> 02:06:49.660
at least functional.

02:06:49.660 --> 02:06:54.769
MATT: Most of them need work. A number of them
backfired during the actual battle, and the other

02:06:54.769 --> 02:07:00.498
ones were not taken very good care of, so you're
probably going to need to run a few repair checks

02:07:00.498 --> 02:07:03.036
on that. You have the materials at your disposal,
you have your workshop.

02:07:03.036 --> 02:07:12.126
TALIESIN: I'm going to do this not in private, but
I'm going to be, then I want to look at Ripley's gun.

02:07:12.126 --> 02:07:16.442
MATT: Okay. You take a good solid look at Animus,
get a feel for it.

02:07:16.442 --> 02:07:18.361
TRAVIS: I've got it!

02:07:18.361 --> 02:07:22.033
MATT: Thank you, Travis.

02:07:22.033 --> 02:07:24.561
SAM: (belches)

02:07:24.561 --> 02:07:26.191
LAURA: Wow.

02:07:26.191 --> 02:07:28.517
TALIESIN: Oh my god, really?

02:07:28.517 --> 02:07:30.649
LIAM: That was Laura Bailey-esque.

02:07:30.649 --> 02:07:33.996
TRAVIS: Can I find Vax while he's looking for the
gun?

02:07:33.996 --> 02:07:35.120
MATT: Yep.

02:07:35.120 --> 02:07:38.464
LAURA: Yeah, I want to go find Vax and Keyleth, as
well.

02:07:38.464 --> 02:07:40.372
TRAVIS: I'm sorry, I meant Vex.

02:07:40.372 --> 02:07:41.530
LAURA: Oh, me?

02:07:41.530 --> 02:07:42.498
TRAVIS: Yeah, you.

02:07:42.498 --> 02:07:44.705
LAURA: You want to find me? Hi, what's up?

02:07:44.705 --> 02:07:48.172
TRAVIS: Hey, so remember when you showed me your
boobies during the fight with Kern?

02:07:48.172 --> 02:07:49.584
LAURA: Oh, you saw them?

02:07:49.584 --> 02:07:52.435
TRAVIS: Only out of the peripheral.

02:07:52.435 --> 02:07:53.953
LAURA: Okay, yes?

02:07:53.953 --> 02:07:58.080
TRAVIS: I wanted to say thank you on a very
delayed timeline by giving you this potion of

02:07:58.080 --> 02:07:59.499
superior healing.

02:07:59.499 --> 02:08:04.221
(laughter)

02:08:04.221 --> 02:08:05.799
LAURA: Thank you &lt;i&gt;so&lt;/i&gt; much, Grog.

02:08:05.799 --> 02:08:09.700
TRAVIS: Yeah, so if they ever get jacked up again,
heal them, because I fight better with boobies

02:08:09.700 --> 02:08:10.958
around.

02:08:10.958 --> 02:08:12.200
LAURA: I'll remember that.

02:08:12.200 --> 02:08:12.985
TRAVIS: Okay, cool.

02:08:12.985 --> 02:08:13.869
LAURA: All right.

02:08:13.869 --> 02:08:14.669
TRAVIS: Deal.

02:08:14.669 --> 02:08:15.711
LAURA: Thank you so much.

02:08:15.711 --> 02:08:16.631
TALIESIN: This is mean.

02:08:16.631 --> 02:08:18.123
LIAM: That was spectacular.

02:08:18.123 --> 02:08:23.872
TALIESIN: I missed everything. I'll watch it on
the preview because this is a--

02:08:23.872 --> 02:08:27.217
MARISHA: Isn't it breast cancer awareness month?
It is, right?

02:08:27.217 --> 02:08:28.756
TALIESIN: Now I'm aware.

02:08:28.756 --> 02:08:30.092
MARISHA: Check your boobs, ladies.

02:08:30.092 --> 02:08:31.320
LAURA: It's important.

02:08:31.320 --> 02:08:33.306
LIAM: Don't let them get jacked up.

02:08:33.306 --> 02:08:46.950
TALIESIN: Okay, I'm going to do my best to clean
and work on these guns tonight, and at some point,

02:08:46.950 --> 02:08:49.231
I'm going to send a guard to find Vax.

02:08:49.231 --> 02:08:55.326
MATT: Vex, you've gone and looked for Vax and
Keyleth. After you guys had your conversation

02:08:55.326 --> 02:09:01.217
about everything, eventually you catch up to-- are
you guys still together? Yeah, so you find the two

02:09:01.217 --> 02:09:02.189
of them.

02:09:02.189 --> 02:09:04.172
LAURA: Hey, did you find anything?

02:09:04.172 --> 02:09:07.628
LIAM: Sort of. I wanted to talk to you and
probably Percival, as well.

02:09:07.628 --> 02:09:09.280
LAURA: Yes?

02:09:09.280 --> 02:09:16.286
LIAM: Well, I communed with my deity--

02:09:16.286 --> 02:09:20.028
LAURA and MARISHA: The Raven Queen.

02:09:20.028 --> 02:09:24.884
LIAM: That's the one! And she said something that
I don't know what she meant.

02:09:24.884 --> 02:09:26.120
LAURA: Okay.

02:09:26.120 --> 02:09:33.152
LIAM: I asked about this Yenk, and she said
everything we needed to know we saw on the way to

02:09:33.152 --> 02:09:34.805
the sphinx.

02:09:34.805 --> 02:09:36.308
LAURA: Which one?

02:09:36.308 --> 02:09:37.852
MARISHA: That's what I said!

02:09:37.852 --> 02:09:40.099
LIAM: She didn't say.

02:09:40.099 --> 02:09:41.175
LAURA: Okay.

02:09:41.175 --> 02:09:43.346
LIAM: I'm drawing a blank, I don't know.

02:09:43.346 --> 02:09:45.889
LAURA: Everything we need, we saw on the way to
the sphinx.

02:09:45.889 --> 02:09:51.230
LIAM: So I remember the more recent trip better.
What happened the first time?

02:09:51.230 --> 02:09:53.100
LAURA: Well, it's here--

02:09:53.100 --> 02:09:54.288
LIAM: It was under the Slayer's Take.

02:09:54.288 --> 02:09:55.154
LAURA: No.

02:09:55.154 --> 02:09:56.443
LIAM: Yes, under the Slayer's Take.

02:09:56.443 --> 02:09:57.916
LAURA: But there was a ziggurat, as well.

02:09:57.916 --> 02:10:02.279
LIAM: Yes. Then the second time--

02:10:02.279 --> 02:10:06.017
LAURA: We went down a cavern, and there was a
name.

02:10:06.017 --> 02:10:08.020
MARISHA: Right. Had to do the whole name trial.

02:10:08.020 --> 02:10:09.174
LIAM: Grog almost drowned.

02:10:09.174 --> 02:10:16.650
MARISHA: So the first one was near where the
Cindergrove is.

02:10:16.650 --> 02:10:19.565
LAURA: Right, and she worshipped the goddess of
knowledge.

02:10:19.565 --> 02:10:23.119
MARISHA: Osysa was her name.

02:10:23.119 --> 02:10:25.367
LIAM: We just spoke to her.

02:10:25.367 --> 02:10:34.483
MATT: Osysa was the gynosphinx who works at the
Slayer's Take. The goddess she worships is Ioun.

02:10:34.483 --> 02:10:36.163
LAURA and MARISHA: Ioun!

02:10:36.163 --> 02:10:45.649
LAURA: So maybe we need to talk to Ioun, no? Maybe
we just talk to a god. That's impossible unless you're--

02:10:45.649 --> 02:10:51.387
LIAM: I just did it, yeah, but I didn't understand
what she told me, so six of one, half a dozen of

02:10:51.387 --> 02:10:52.484
the other.

02:10:52.484 --> 02:10:55.198
LAURA: Worthless, really. Yeah. That's a nice
cloak you have there, Keyleth.

02:10:55.198 --> 02:10:59.387
MARISHA: It's a little baggy, but thank you.

02:10:59.387 --> 02:11:03.489
LIAM: I gave you a cloak once, and you stopped
using it.

02:11:03.489 --> 02:11:11.733
LAURA: This is true. It looks lovely, though,
stacked next to the rest of my clothing. Do you

02:11:11.733 --> 02:11:13.492
want it back?

02:11:13.492 --> 02:11:15.080
LIAM: No, I do not want it back.

02:11:15.080 --> 02:11:21.929
LAURA: He only gives cloaks to those he really
cares about, Keyleth. Really cares about.

02:11:21.929 --> 02:11:27.849
LIAM: This is really awkward, and I'm going to
walk the fuck out of here. Good night, ladies.

02:11:27.849 --> 02:11:31.751
MARISHA: I got a wink from Vex!

02:11:31.751 --> 02:11:36.574
LIAM: I go off looking for Percy.

02:11:36.574 --> 02:11:43.048
TALIESIN: Good man.

02:11:43.048 --> 02:11:47.079
MATT: While they share their awkward smile, you
find Percival down in his workshop, currently

02:11:47.079 --> 02:11:52.490
repairing weaponry with Ripley's gun placed down
out on its own in the middle of the table.

02:11:52.490 --> 02:11:53.891
LIAM: Hello?

02:11:53.891 --> 02:11:55.397
TALIESIN: Oh, good. It's you.

02:11:55.397 --> 02:11:56.595
LIAM: Do you mind?

02:11:56.595 --> 02:11:58.657
TALIESIN: Not at all. I was actually hoping you
would stop in.

02:11:58.657 --> 02:12:01.935
LIAM: Gods! What does all this shit do?

02:12:01.935 --> 02:12:06.697
TALIESIN: Mostly break, quite successfully.

02:12:06.697 --> 02:12:12.591
LIAM: Just like us. I just broke in the temple
that you--

02:12:12.591 --> 02:12:16.989
TALIESIN: I assume it was vague and unhelpful?

02:12:16.989 --> 02:12:18.817
LIAM: It was.

02:12:18.817 --> 02:12:19.955
TALIESIN: Excellent!

02:12:19.955 --> 02:12:25.406
LIAM: First, I don't think I ever officially
thanked you for it.

02:12:25.406 --> 02:12:27.179
TALIESIN: You're welcome.

02:12:27.179 --> 02:12:30.656
LIAM: Thank you. How are you feeling, buddy?

02:12:30.656 --> 02:12:36.950
TALIESIN: (sighs) I'm terrified, but other than
that, I think I'm good.

02:12:36.950 --> 02:12:48.559
LIAM: I came here for a reason, you're the brain,
you're the one that hangs brain. I don't know what

02:12:48.559 --> 02:13:03.327
to make of my conversation with the higher power.
I asked about Yenk. I asked what we should do, and

02:13:03.327 --> 02:13:06.967
she talked about the sphinxes. She said that
everything that we needed to know we learned on

02:13:06.967 --> 02:13:11.305
the way to the sphinx. I don't know which one? I
don't know if it was the gynosphinx or the

02:13:11.305 --> 02:13:12.699
not-gynosphinx?

02:13:12.699 --> 02:13:19.821
TALIESIN: I would assume it was the sphinx that
was guarding her treasure. Oh! You should take a

02:13:19.821 --> 02:13:28.743
look at this. And I point at the open book with
the picture. Look what we have. &lt;i&gt;That&lt;/i&gt; is our friend.

02:13:28.743 --> 02:13:31.275
MARISHA: Oh, is that Yenk?

02:13:31.275 --> 02:13:33.932
LAURA: Well, it's one of Yenk's brethren.

02:13:33.932 --> 02:13:36.419
LIAM: Did you follow me down here? I said I didn't
fucking want to--

02:13:36.419 --> 02:13:39.437
LAURA: Well, obviously Keyleth's there, so I
figured I was, too!

02:13:39.437 --> 02:13:42.382
MARISHA: I thought you were working in the middle
of--

02:13:42.382 --> 02:13:48.223
TALIESIN: My door's open. I'm in my thing, but
it's open, and I've already sent people to send for--

02:13:48.223 --> 02:13:53.324
MARISHA: I said "Hi, Percy." It's not my fault no
one notices I'm around. It's not my fault I'm a

02:13:53.324 --> 02:13:54.631
fucking wallflower.

02:13:54.631 --> 02:13:59.849
LIAM: You scared the shit out of me. This is some
nasty business. This is what we're dealing with?

02:13:59.849 --> 02:14:06.485
TALIESIN: Yes, and if all goes well, which it
never does, that will be fighting the white

02:14:06.485 --> 02:14:15.694
dragon, and possibly the green dragon. And one of
the two of them will kill the other, and then we

02:14:15.694 --> 02:14:18.033
swoop in and clean up what's left.

02:14:18.033 --> 02:14:20.794
LIAM: I don't know if it's smart, but I'm really
curious.

02:14:20.794 --> 02:14:26.873
TALIESIN: I know. I understand; I feel the same
way. It's probably not going to work. It's

02:14:26.873 --> 02:14:28.372
probably going to go terribly.

02:14:28.372 --> 02:14:31.339
LIAM: I think it might.

02:14:31.339 --> 02:14:37.148
TALIESIN: I think it might work. I'm feeling good
about that.

02:14:37.148 --> 02:14:43.146
LAURA: Do we even know how to use the Gate scroll
exactly? Scanlan has to use it, right?

02:14:43.146 --> 02:14:44.971
LIAM: Yeah, the little guy can pull it off.

02:14:44.971 --> 02:14:47.173
MARISHA: It's going to have to be either Scanlan
or me but--

02:14:47.173 --> 02:14:48.368
SAM: Hey, guys!

02:14:48.368 --> 02:14:50.243
MARISHA: Scanlan! Hey!

02:14:50.243 --> 02:14:55.590
SAM: Door was open, thought I'd come in. Grog's
right outside in the hall.

02:14:55.590 --> 02:14:59.510
MARISHA: Hey, Grog! Come on in.

02:14:59.510 --> 02:15:02.865
LIAM: Have you ever been here? Look at all this
fucking esoteric bullshit!

02:15:02.865 --> 02:15:04.286
TRAVIS: Wow.

02:15:04.286 --> 02:15:07.047
SAM: It's crazy! Is that a brain in a jar?

02:15:07.047 --> 02:15:11.492
TALIESIN: No-- yes, that is &lt;i&gt;something&lt;/i&gt; in a jar.
It's not a brain, though.

02:15:11.492 --> 02:15:13.210
TRAVIS: What's that a picture of?

02:15:13.210 --> 02:15:15.545
LAURA: Oh, that's the goristro.

02:15:15.545 --> 02:15:16.957
TRAVIS: Oh. What are the other ones?

02:15:16.957 --> 02:15:22.066
LAURA: Well, one is called a snake lady. A
marilith.

02:15:22.066 --> 02:15:25.286
TRAVIS: Are they all together, or is it the one
guy?

02:15:25.286 --> 02:15:30.182
LAURA: I think it's just the one guy. Hopefully,
other things can't come through. Can they? Read

02:15:30.182 --> 02:15:31.703
that scroll again, Scanlan.

02:15:31.703 --> 02:15:38.043
SAM: What, my Gate scroll? Yeah, well, I left that
at home today, but I think it calls the thing that

02:15:38.043 --> 02:15:41.987
you call for. You give it a name, it goes, it
grabs it, it brings it in.

02:15:41.987 --> 02:15:44.340
LAURA: It doesn't bring other things through?
Doesn't leave the gate open?

02:15:44.340 --> 02:15:49.461
SAM: The gate does stay open for as long as your
conjuration, which is about a minute.

02:15:49.461 --> 02:15:52.026
LAURA: So other things could come through.

02:15:52.026 --> 02:15:53.730
SAM: Yes, that is true--

02:15:53.730 --> 02:15:55.895
MARISHA: But you could close the gate once it
passes through.

02:15:55.895 --> 02:16:03.994
SAM: I could drop it, yes. However, this is a
tricky spell for me because I am not-- as much as

02:16:03.994 --> 02:16:10.957
it pains me to say this, I am not good enough to
cast this spell.

02:16:10.957 --> 02:16:13.154
LIAM: You're selling yourself short.

02:16:13.154 --> 02:16:20.291
SAM: I'm really good, but I'm not quite that good,
so I can cast it, but it carries a risk. If luck

02:16:20.291 --> 02:16:25.182
is not on my side, it will not work.

02:16:25.182 --> 02:16:30.544
TRAVIS: Like, it burns when you pee risk, or it's
going to fall off in three months risk?

02:16:30.544 --> 02:16:36.298
SAM: Like it won't work forever. I get one shot.
If I don't do it right, it's gone forever.

02:16:36.298 --> 02:16:37.896
TRAVIS: Are we talking about your penis, still?

02:16:37.896 --> 02:16:40.468
SAM: Yes. My penis will fall off.

02:16:40.468 --> 02:16:41.749
TRAVIS: That is terrible.

02:16:41.749 --> 02:16:43.459
LAURA: We will have Raishan with us.

02:16:43.459 --> 02:16:53.206
SAM: I'm not giving this thing to Raishan. But do
we know anyone who is at a slightly higher skill

02:16:53.206 --> 02:16:54.607
level than me?

02:16:54.607 --> 02:16:56.016
LIAM: Allura or Gilmore.

02:16:56.016 --> 02:16:59.939
MARISHA: Also, Kima wanted to come with us to
fight the white dragon, remember?

02:16:59.939 --> 02:17:01.631
SAM: Is she an arcane caster?

02:17:01.631 --> 02:17:06.356
MARISHA: She's not, but if Kima is going, then
maybe Allura will.

02:17:06.356 --> 02:17:12.410
TRAVIS: We can't bring them. We'd have to tell
them that Raishan's with us.

02:17:12.410 --> 02:17:18.591
LAURA: No, we wouldn't. Raishan will be in
disguise.

02:17:18.591 --> 02:17:24.204
LIAM: Raishan has had everyone fooled for a long
time.

02:17:24.204 --> 02:17:27.126
SAM: Do we know where Kima and Allura are?

02:17:27.126 --> 02:17:29.668
MATT: You haven't checked in to see if they're
here or not.

02:17:29.668 --> 02:17:31.603
LAURA: Oh, they could be at the castle?

02:17:31.603 --> 02:17:36.480
MATT: They wouldn't be at the castle. They stay at
one of the houses at the northern end of the city.

02:17:36.480 --> 02:17:39.132
TRAVIS: Should I call for a guard?

02:17:39.132 --> 02:17:40.333
TALIESIN: Call for a guard.

02:17:40.333 --> 02:17:41.657
TRAVIS: (loudly) Guard!

02:17:41.657 --> 02:17:44.425
TALIESIN: There's one literally down the hall.

02:17:44.425 --> 02:17:46.006
TRAVIS: Oh. (stage whisper) Guard!

02:17:46.006 --> 02:17:53.795
MATT: Who has now arrived and steps up. "You
called, Grog?"

02:17:53.795 --> 02:17:58.041
TRAVIS: Yeah, no, please don't use my official
title. If you would, could you go see if Lady Kima

02:17:58.041 --> 02:18:00.974
and Lady Allura are around?

02:18:00.974 --> 02:18:03.396
MATT: "Do you wish for me to fetch them?"

02:18:03.396 --> 02:18:05.679
TRAVIS: Yes. Go forth, quickly, with haste.

02:18:05.679 --> 02:18:10.251
MATT: He rushes off. You hear the armor and
chainmail clinking in the distance.

02:18:10.251 --> 02:18:11.458
LAURA: What time is it?

02:18:11.458 --> 02:18:17.623
MATT: It's mid-afternoon. You guys have spent the
day doing research and checking things out. You

02:18:17.623 --> 02:18:22.150
woke up in the morning and you had your
conversation with Raishan, so it's two, three in

02:18:22.150 --> 02:18:23.288
the afternoon.

02:18:23.288 --> 02:18:28.239
MARISHA: I have another question. How far are we,
timeline in the year? How close are we getting to

02:18:28.239 --> 02:18:29.807
Winter's Crest?

02:18:29.807 --> 02:18:39.074
MATT: You are close to three months past it, so
you have a ways to go before it's Winter's Crest

02:18:39.074 --> 02:18:40.205
again.

02:18:40.205 --> 02:18:41.805
MARISHA: When's the next solstice?

02:18:41.805 --> 02:18:47.883
MATT: The celestial solstice? You're not sure,
actually. Make a nature check.

02:18:47.883 --> 02:18:51.325
MARISHA: There's not a summer solstice and winter
solstice?

02:18:51.325 --> 02:18:53.186
MATT: There are solstices, yes.

02:18:53.186 --> 02:18:57.134
MARISHA: 24.

02:18:57.134 --> 02:19:07.081
MATT: 24. The next solstice is going to be in
about a month. Roughly 28 days.

02:19:07.081 --> 02:19:09.487
LAURA: Whatever relevance that has.

02:19:09.487 --> 02:19:11.585
TRAVIS: So none at all.

02:19:11.585 --> 02:19:14.312
TALIESIN: No, I see what you're getting at.

02:19:14.312 --> 02:19:25.543
MARISHA: Thordak was busted out on the winter's
solstice, right? Also, the Briarwoods were rushing

02:19:25.543 --> 02:19:29.829
to try and get the ziggurat up and running in time
for the solstice.

02:19:29.829 --> 02:19:32.296
LAURA: Right. Important day, is that?

02:19:32.296 --> 02:19:39.743
MARISHA: Very important day, where nature and
stars tend to align and planes can blur a little bit.

02:19:39.743 --> 02:19:46.788
TRAVIS: Can I ask a quick question? I really like
this plan to use the gate thing and go attack

02:19:46.788 --> 02:19:52.222
Vorugal. I don't even feel like we need Raishan
for it. Shouldn't we lure her away to somewhere

02:19:52.222 --> 02:19:54.030
and then fucking kill her?

02:19:54.030 --> 02:19:56.253
TALIESIN: This &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; luring her away somewhere.

02:19:56.253 --> 02:19:58.188
MARISHA: The sooner she dies, the happier I'll
be.

02:19:58.188 --> 02:20:00.630
LAURA: We get her over there, and then we kill her
afterward.

02:20:00.630 --> 02:20:09.694
TRAVIS: But we'll be weak and she's on the fringe,
because remember, she's barely helping out?

02:20:09.694 --> 02:20:12.717
SAM: What is she going to be doing to help us,
anyway?

02:20:12.717 --> 02:20:14.009
TRAVIS: We haven't decided.

02:20:14.009 --> 02:20:19.833
LAURA: She was going to be another magic user,
dressed as a human, or something.

02:20:19.833 --> 02:20:25.356
TRAVIS: I like tricks, but Ripley got us pretty
good, and I don't feel like walking right into

02:20:25.356 --> 02:20:27.798
another trap one week before another fight.

02:20:27.798 --> 02:20:40.450
LIAM: I think better to get Raishan away from
here, and in that fray, she might not be touched,

02:20:40.450 --> 02:20:43.564
but she might be whittled down a little bit.
That's better than nothing.

02:20:43.564 --> 02:20:45.128
TALIESIN: She'll spend some power.

02:20:45.128 --> 02:20:47.251
LIAM: We have to get her away from Whitestone. We
have to.

02:20:47.251 --> 02:20:52.493
TRAVIS: I guess we couldn't get her anywhere with
a low ceiling, where her dragon form doesn't have

02:20:52.493 --> 02:20:54.011
such an advantage?

02:20:54.011 --> 02:20:55.553
TALIESIN: I think the ceiling would give.

02:20:55.553 --> 02:20:58.595
TRAVIS: No, I mean a cave or something.

02:20:58.595 --> 02:20:59.804
SAM: We could do that.

02:20:59.804 --> 02:21:00.964
TALIESIN: How?

02:21:00.964 --> 02:21:03.276
MARISHA: Vorugal lived in a cave.

02:21:03.276 --> 02:21:08.618
LAURA: Yeah, but a little cave. A cave that Asum
would fit in.

02:21:08.618 --> 02:21:14.665
MATT: That wasn't a cave, it was inside a chasm. A
giant ravine.

02:21:14.665 --> 02:21:21.567
TALIESIN: I think far away on another continent is
a great idea.

02:21:21.567 --> 02:21:23.449
TRAVIS: What about the little cave in Glintshore?

02:21:23.449 --> 02:21:28.630
TALIESIN: I'm happy just to take her. She's going
to follow us already.

02:21:28.630 --> 02:21:37.551
MARISHA: Well, here's my question. I'm sure she's
anticipating us turning on her. What would you do

02:21:37.551 --> 02:21:40.401
if you were a green dragon anticipating people
turning on you?

02:21:40.401 --> 02:21:51.956
TALIESIN: It depends. If I needed them, I would
put myself in a position of safety, make myself

02:21:51.956 --> 02:21:56.796
useful, and then make sure I was back somewhere
where they would not attack me as quickly as

02:21:56.796 --> 02:22:00.901
possible. If I didn't need them, I would turn on
them immediately after the fight.

02:22:00.901 --> 02:22:05.577
LIAM: She's going to put out the barest amount of
effort to help us from behind.

02:22:05.577 --> 02:22:14.252
TALIESIN: If we die, her plan foils. If we do not
feel she put in enough effort, her plan also foils.

02:22:14.252 --> 02:22:22.894
TRAVIS: I picture Thordak going, "Raishan, use
your treachery and intellect and go kill Vox Machina."

02:22:22.894 --> 02:22:30.369
TALIESIN: My feeling is use your treachery-- Where
are we? We're in my shop right now? Okay.

02:22:30.369 --> 02:22:37.398
MARISHA: Keep that in mind. We could be getting
spied on. Are we being watched?

02:22:37.398 --> 02:22:43.420
MATT: You have no sense of being watched by any
exterior force.

02:22:43.420 --> 02:22:48.693
LIAM: Also, we know we're walking into this shit.
That's no surprise.

02:22:48.693 --> 02:22:55.293
SAM: And our plan doesn't necessarily have to be
kill Vorugal, turn and kill Raishan right there.

02:22:55.293 --> 02:22:58.939
We can keep playing with her for a little while
longer.

02:22:58.939 --> 02:23:01.634
LAURA: She can sense lies.

02:23:01.634 --> 02:23:08.252
TRAVIS: All right, so we buck up. We go through
with it.

02:23:08.252 --> 02:23:13.563
TALIESIN: We go through with it. We made an
agreement. I say we honor it until such point as

02:23:13.563 --> 02:23:15.538
it is deeply inconvenient.

02:23:15.538 --> 02:23:16.856
TRAVIS: I'm down.

02:23:16.856 --> 02:23:19.192
LAURA: Can I go find Zahra?

02:23:19.192 --> 02:23:20.972
MATT: You can, yes.

02:23:20.972 --> 02:23:23.961
TALIESIN: Vax, your boy.

02:23:23.961 --> 02:23:27.640
LIAM: Arguably so, yeah.

02:23:27.640 --> 02:23:37.061
TALIESIN: Your boy. I'm thinking of creating a
company of shot for the castle with these guns. Do

02:23:37.061 --> 02:23:45.640
you think that would be a position that would suit
him? Guards that would be forbidden from carrying

02:23:45.640 --> 02:23:53.013
these weapons outside the walls of the castle
itself, and would arm the parapets if there was an

02:23:53.013 --> 02:23:55.012
attack from a dragon.

02:23:55.012 --> 02:24:03.558
LIAM: I do. I don't know how good a judge of
character I am, though.

02:24:03.558 --> 02:24:06.617
TALIESIN: Hopefully, a better judge than I am.

02:24:06.617 --> 02:24:23.857
LIAM: You know, I have face-planted more than any
of you, maybe. I have with that boy. I can see it

02:24:23.857 --> 02:24:34.092
in his eyes. We're up to our elbows in blood.
There has to be room for a little bit of

02:24:34.092 --> 02:24:37.339
redemption in this world.

02:24:37.339 --> 02:24:43.763
TALIESIN: I'm a big believer in second chances. At
least, I am now.

02:24:43.763 --> 02:24:47.596
LIAM: It's a good idea.

02:24:47.596 --> 02:24:55.035
TALIESIN: I wanted to check with you. I thought
this was something that I assumed you would have

02:24:55.035 --> 02:24:57.563
some insight into.

02:24:57.563 --> 02:25:02.175
LIAM: Do we have time to teach them how these
things work?

02:25:02.175 --> 02:25:05.977
TALIESIN: He may already know a bit. He spent some
time around them, which is also why I thought it

02:25:05.977 --> 02:25:07.552
might be helpful.

02:25:07.552 --> 02:25:13.111
LIAM: Do you want to talk to him?

02:25:13.111 --> 02:25:22.321
TALIESIN: Well, I figured &lt;i&gt;we&lt;/i&gt; would talk to him.
I'm still not 100%. We are going to be fighting

02:25:22.321 --> 02:25:24.635
these dragons, and I am not at my best.

02:25:24.635 --> 02:25:29.882
LIAM: Well, you probably need to get to bed, but
why don't we go find him before it grows too late?

02:25:29.882 --> 02:25:39.396
TALIESIN: I'll continue to work on these. Bring
him down when you find him.

02:25:39.396 --> 02:25:42.206
LIAM: I will. Thank you. I head out.

02:25:42.206 --> 02:25:47.074
MATT: Okay. Percy, can you make three tinkering
checks for me?

02:25:47.074 --> 02:25:48.508
TALIESIN: Tinkering check?

02:25:48.508 --> 02:25:49.533
MATT: Yes.

02:25:49.533 --> 02:25:50.593
SAM: Three.

02:25:50.593 --> 02:26:06.708
TALIESIN: Stop that. Where did all my dice go?
Okay, apparently I have three. Dex, proficiency,

02:26:06.708 --> 02:26:24.550
if I recall? Okay. That's a 29, a 27, and a 13.

02:26:24.550 --> 02:26:28.554
MATT: Okay. Rudimentary in their design, but
functional. You manage to clean them all and

02:26:28.554 --> 02:26:34.888
repair the ones that were heavily damaged earlier
and make them functional again without an issue.

02:26:34.888 --> 02:26:38.538
During that time, Keyleth, you were going to
mention something, you said?

02:26:38.538 --> 02:26:40.172
TRAVIS: And Zahra.

02:26:40.172 --> 02:26:45.073
MARISHA: What did you say about Ioun, and why is
Ioun important right now?

02:26:45.073 --> 02:26:56.712
MATT: Ioun is the god of knowledge and spreading
of knowledge and was what the temple that Osysa

02:26:56.712 --> 02:27:02.401
watches beneath the Slayers' Take is based around.
It's also what the ziggurat beneath the city used

02:27:02.401 --> 02:27:07.213
to be: a temple to Ioun, before it was corrupted
by the Briarwoods.

02:27:07.213 --> 02:27:11.509
MARISHA: Scanlan, do you still have those Ioun
stones?

02:27:11.509 --> 02:27:13.602
SAM: I have an Ioun stone.

02:27:13.602 --> 02:27:23.994
MARISHA: Okay. Was Raven's Slumber the name of the
temple?

02:27:23.994 --> 02:27:25.620
LAURA: That's my necklace.

02:27:25.620 --> 02:27:32.648
MARISHA: That's your necklace that's got Trinket
in it.

02:27:32.648 --> 02:27:39.290
LAURA: When we're not in the city. He's out of the
necklace. Yes, he's always around.

02:27:39.290 --> 02:27:49.136
MARISHA: What if we go back to that temple?

02:27:49.136 --> 02:27:51.402
SAM: And do what?

02:27:51.402 --> 02:27:54.931
MATT: Vax is gone right now.

02:27:54.931 --> 02:27:56.559
LAURA: I'm also gone.

02:27:56.559 --> 02:27:59.544
TALIESIN: She's been helping me clean.

02:27:59.544 --> 02:28:03.107
MARISHA: Never mind, keep going. I'm just trying
to figure this out.

02:28:03.107 --> 02:28:10.515
MATT: All right. Vex, you go ahead and find Zahra,
who's in the process of still researching in her

02:28:10.515 --> 02:28:20.228
room, her and Allura, while she was focusing on
the ziggurat and the essence of it. So you find

02:28:20.228 --> 02:28:24.130
her and her tomes are spread out, and she's
actually fallen asleep on her desk in her room.

02:28:24.130 --> 02:28:29.943
LAURA: Knock-knock? Zahra?

02:28:29.943 --> 02:28:37.630
MATT: Puts her wand out in your direction.
"Darling, I'm so sorry! I didn't mean that."

02:28:37.630 --> 02:28:40.661
LAURA: How are you? How are things?

02:28:40.661 --> 02:28:48.331
MATT: "Tiring, if anything." She wipes this bit of
drool from the side of her chin. Immediately sits

02:28:48.331 --> 02:28:50.572
upright in her chair.

02:28:50.572 --> 02:28:52.857
LAURA: I never noticed the drool, don't worry.

02:28:52.857 --> 02:29:00.008
MATT: (chuckles) "Good, just trying to figure out
what we can from these siphons."

02:29:00.008 --> 02:29:01.696
LAURA: Anything interesting?

02:29:01.696 --> 02:29:05.743
MATT: "Not yet, though it's been a lot of fun
throwing things into them and watching them go away."

02:29:05.743 --> 02:29:14.936
LAURA: Speaking of, you've been very busy, I know,
with all of your research, but do you remember

02:29:14.936 --> 02:29:17.105
what we spoke of before we left?

02:29:17.105 --> 02:29:18.748
MATT: "Remind me."

02:29:18.748 --> 02:29:20.604
LAURA: Arrows of dragon-slaying?

02:29:20.604 --> 02:29:26.544
MATT: "Oh, yes! I was able to muster one."

02:29:26.544 --> 02:29:29.299
LAURA: Okay, that's wonderful! One is better than
none.

02:29:29.299 --> 02:29:35.001
MATT: "That is all I've been able to get done in
time." She pulls out a small case and opens it. It

02:29:35.001 --> 02:29:42.121
looks a little roughshod, not quite as perfect,
but she says, "The enchantment took."

02:29:42.121 --> 02:29:47.620
LAURA: Wonderful! This is costly, what do I owe
you?

02:29:47.620 --> 02:29:54.497
MATT: "Oh, for this?" Let's find out.

02:29:54.497 --> 02:30:01.941
LAURA: I hope this isn't a lot.

02:30:01.941 --> 02:30:05.557
TRAVIS: 5,000 gold.

02:30:05.557 --> 02:30:12.757
MATT: "That would come to roughly-- on the market,
about 30,000 gold pieces."

02:30:12.757 --> 02:30:23.787
LAURA: But she made it, so that's not how much it
would be, right? Zahra said it wasn't that much before.

02:30:23.787 --> 02:30:35.258
MATT: "It's &lt;i&gt;mostly&lt;/i&gt; done? I could keep working on
it, if you like, and make it all done."

02:30:35.258 --> 02:30:40.680
LAURA: Oh. Okay. But that's 30,000 gold pieces?

02:30:40.680 --> 02:30:44.866
MATT: "Well, for cost and time. I'd put it more
about 12, for a friend."

02:30:44.866 --> 02:30:48.527
LAURA: Jesus. Man.

02:30:48.527 --> 02:30:51.172
TRAVIS: Better make it work, then. Better wait.

02:30:51.172 --> 02:30:53.941
LAURA: I'll wait. You keep making this awesome.

02:30:53.941 --> 02:30:59.372
MATT: "Okay. Sorry dear, I haven't had a lot of
time."

02:30:59.372 --> 02:31:01.812
LAURA: (dryly) No. I know you're so busy.

02:31:01.812 --> 02:31:07.062
LIAM: The romance is over.

02:31:07.062 --> 02:31:09.636
(laughter)

02:31:09.636 --> 02:31:14.604
LAURA: Mark it back down to one in my-- Zahra,
you're amazing.

02:31:14.604 --> 02:31:19.104
LIAM: (dryly) No, it's great. It's super cool.

02:31:19.104 --> 02:31:26.972
LAURA: We're going into battle pretty soon. These
fuckers are pretty dangerous, so I'm concerned.

02:31:26.972 --> 02:31:33.356
MATT: "So should I balk on the research and focus
on--"

02:31:33.356 --> 02:31:37.486
LAURA: Keep doing what you're doing. If you find
the time--

02:31:37.486 --> 02:31:40.561
MATT: "Noted."

02:31:40.561 --> 02:31:42.888
LAURA: Thank you, Zahra.

02:31:42.888 --> 02:31:49.977
MATT: "No worries, dear. I should make some tea."
She rubs her eye a little bit, gets up. "Have a

02:31:49.977 --> 02:31:55.216
"good night, Vex." Walks by. As she exits the room
as you stand there, her tail whips you in the back.

02:31:55.216 --> 02:31:57.359
LAURA: I deserved that!

02:31:57.359 --> 02:32:00.649
LIAM: Mary is going to see this!

02:32:00.649 --> 02:32:02.654
LAURA: Mary said it was only five, okay.

02:32:02.654 --> 02:32:06.923
TALIESIN: Mary says a lot of things.

02:32:06.923 --> 02:32:09.914
TRAVIS: Did Kima and Allura show up yet?

02:32:09.914 --> 02:32:13.411
MATT: Kima shows up.

02:32:13.411 --> 02:32:15.489
TRAVIS: Kima shows up? Kima!

02:32:15.489 --> 02:32:22.476
MATT: As she walks up, it's midday. She's not
armored at all. She's wearing a standard linen

02:32:22.476 --> 02:32:28.135
shirt that's sweat through. It looks like she's
been doing physical labor work and she comes up

02:32:28.135 --> 02:32:32.392
with dirt smeared in her face. "Grog, it's been a
while!"

02:32:32.392 --> 02:32:36.637
TRAVIS: It has! Yeah, you little badass.

02:32:36.637 --> 02:32:43.010
MATT: (chuckles) "You big badass. What can I do
for you?"

02:32:43.010 --> 02:32:46.941
TRAVIS: Oh. Yeah. The thinkers are inside the
room.

02:32:46.941 --> 02:32:52.142
SAM: Hey. Where's Allura?

02:32:52.142 --> 02:32:54.443
MATT: "Do you need me to get her, as well?"

02:32:54.443 --> 02:32:57.072
SAM: Yeah, the guard was supposed to get you
both.

02:32:57.072 --> 02:33:02.599
MATT: "Ugh. I'll be right back." She leaves for a
bit. You wait a little bit longer.

02:33:02.599 --> 02:33:13.316
Eventually, she comes back with Allura. Allura not
quite as dirty as Kima. They both arrive. "Hello,

02:33:13.316 --> 02:33:18.412
"I'm glad to see you've returned. Can I help you?"

02:33:18.412 --> 02:33:27.878
SAM: Yes, I don't normally need to ask for help
with magic, but this Gate scroll that I have here,

02:33:27.878 --> 02:33:30.309
is this something that you can do?

02:33:30.309 --> 02:33:33.641
MATT: "This is beyond my magic."

02:33:33.641 --> 02:33:37.003
SAM: Forget I ever showed it to you. Doesn't
exist.

02:33:37.003 --> 02:33:39.139
MATT: "No, this is incredible. This is very
powerful magic."

02:33:39.139 --> 02:33:41.744
SAM: I know it's really cool, but you shouldn't
know about it. It's bad news.

02:33:41.744 --> 02:33:50.289
MATT: "I think it has quite a bit of utility, to
be honest. Do you need this, or could I--"

02:33:50.289 --> 02:33:54.018
SAM: No, I do need it, desperately, yes. It's very
vital to our mission.

02:33:54.018 --> 02:33:55.810
MATT: "Well, all right."

02:33:55.810 --> 02:34:00.043
TRAVIS: Whoa, wait. Do you have a use for it in
mind, in particular?

02:34:00.043 --> 02:34:10.322
MATT: "Well, this is the kind of spell that I
could copy into my spellbook, and once I'm able to

02:34:10.322 --> 02:34:13.292
"utilize it down the road it would be at my
disposal."

02:34:13.292 --> 02:34:16.736
SAM: Would that make this scroll inactive?

02:34:16.736 --> 02:34:22.817
MATT: "It would destroy the scroll, but I would be
able to utilize the spell in a few years, maybe."

02:34:22.817 --> 02:34:28.848
TRAVIS: How long does it take to copy down the
scroll? A couple seconds?

02:34:28.848 --> 02:34:31.267
MATT: "It takes a few hours, maybe."

02:34:31.267 --> 02:34:34.622
TRAVIS: What is this voice I'm hearing?

02:34:34.622 --> 02:34:38.789
LAURA: I just wandered back. I'm done talking to
Zahra. Hey. The door's open.

02:34:38.789 --> 02:34:55.191
MATT: "Be careful with that. From what I can glean
from the enchantment, it offers you quite a chance

02:34:55.191 --> 02:35:00.461
"to pull pretty much anything to your side, but no
real bindings on what you pull through."

02:35:00.461 --> 02:35:14.336
SAM: Yes. I think I understand how it works, but I
don't know if I'll be able to do it when the time comes.

02:35:14.336 --> 02:35:19.463
TRAVIS: No bindings on what comes through? You
might get more than you bargained for?

02:35:19.463 --> 02:35:27.467
MATT: "There are many a mage who ended up trying
to bend something to their will and weren't seen

02:35:27.467 --> 02:35:29.122
"ever again."

02:35:29.122 --> 02:35:36.182
SAM: I think what she's referring to is once we
pull the thing through, it acts of its own

02:35:36.182 --> 02:35:38.495
volition. We can't tell it what to do.

02:35:38.495 --> 02:35:40.669
LAURA: We stay clear.

02:35:40.669 --> 02:35:46.010
TRAVIS: Okay. But will its friends come through?

02:35:46.010 --> 02:35:48.406
SAM: Probably not?

02:35:48.406 --> 02:35:51.153
TRAVIS: Probably is good enough for me.

02:35:51.153 --> 02:35:55.299
SAM: (sighs) All right.

02:35:55.299 --> 02:35:59.833
LAURA: Once we pull it through, how do we keep it
in place long enough for--

02:35:59.833 --> 02:36:03.300
SAM: We don't, we pull it through right in front
of--

02:36:03.300 --> 02:36:05.361
LAURA: How do we get in front of--

02:36:05.361 --> 02:36:06.928
SAM: I could be invisible.

02:36:06.928 --> 02:36:11.406
TRAVIS: Allura, thank you so much for your time.
Please don't let us disturb you any longer.

02:36:11.406 --> 02:36:18.249
MATT: "No worries, I'm about to ready continuing
to strengthen the veil with Shaun--"

02:36:18.249 --> 02:36:22.882
SAM: Also I don't know if you'd heard, but Tiberius
fell.

02:36:22.882 --> 02:36:45.904
MATT: "Oh. I'm sorry to hear that. These are
dangerous times. I've got something I've got to

02:36:45.904 --> 02:36:56.845
"do. Stay safe. Be careful with that." She walks
out of the room, a little dazed, and rubs the top

02:36:56.845 --> 02:37:01.221
of Kima's head, and you watch her leave.

02:37:01.221 --> 02:37:03.557
LAURA: How is she?

02:37:03.557 --> 02:37:07.780
MATT: "She's stretched a little thin these days,
to be honest."

02:37:07.780 --> 02:37:09.870
LAURA: Her and Gilmore both.

02:37:09.870 --> 02:37:12.691
MATT: "Well there's a lot going on, and a lot
needs to be &lt;i&gt;found&lt;/i&gt; and a lot needs to be &lt;i&gt;done&lt;/i&gt;,

02:37:12.691 --> 02:37:22.521
"and a never-ending barrage of responsibility.
Which I despise. Where are you guys off to?"

02:37:22.521 --> 02:37:26.600
LAURA: Well, something you might enjoy, actually.

02:37:26.600 --> 02:37:35.344
MATT: "Really?" You see this big, toothy grin curl
across her face, and her fingers twitch. "So?"

02:37:35.344 --> 02:37:37.374
LAURA: Feel like killing a dragon?

02:37:37.374 --> 02:37:44.183
MATT: (excited chuckles) "I was hoping you'd say
that! Let me get my armor. How soon? When?"

02:37:44.183 --> 02:37:47.478
TRAVIS: Pretty soon. We only save you for the big
fights.

02:37:47.478 --> 02:37:55.599
MATT: "All righty! Stay right here. I'll be right
back!" She darts off with a spring in her step and

02:37:55.599 --> 02:37:57.546
a little chuckle as she heads down the
hall.

02:37:57.546 --> 02:37:59.105
TRAVIS: Quick, before she comes back.

02:37:59.105 --> 02:38:00.084
LAURA: No!

02:38:00.084 --> 02:38:02.533
TRAVIS: What? It would be the best bag ever, come
on.

02:38:02.533 --> 02:38:04.511
SAM: Won't she ask why Asum is with us?

02:38:04.511 --> 02:38:06.952
LAURA: No.

02:38:06.952 --> 02:38:08.782
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:38:08.782 --> 02:38:13.387
MARISHA: Here's what I think. She's going to find out
eventually, and then what do we say when they all

02:38:13.424 --> 02:38:15.346
know we've known the whole time?

02:38:15.346 --> 02:38:22.354
TRAVIS: Look, when we start attacking Seeker Asum,
then we kill Kima. What? She's probably a dragon, too.

02:38:22.354 --> 02:38:30.509
LAURA: Shit. I totally did that, didn't I? But she
wanted to come! And fight the dragon. I'm an idiot.

02:38:30.509 --> 02:38:35.340
TRAVIS: Look, we don't have to tell her. As soon
as we hit Raishan, she'll reveal herself, anyway.

02:38:35.340 --> 02:38:38.962
That was our agreement, not tell, right?

02:38:38.962 --> 02:38:42.375
MARISHA: But then what happens when Kima goes, did
you guys know?

02:38:42.375 --> 02:38:43.845
TALIESIN: Yes.

02:38:43.845 --> 02:38:45.465
TRAVIS: Yeah. She didn't ask.

02:38:45.465 --> 02:38:49.377
SAM: Paints us as pretty shady folk.

02:38:49.377 --> 02:38:53.865
MARISHA: These are the people we need to trust us.
They are our allies.

02:38:53.865 --> 02:38:57.569
TALIESIN: She has kept secrets from us, and we
have a perfectly legitimate reason for not

02:38:57.569 --> 02:38:58.566
telling.

02:38:58.566 --> 02:38:59.883
TRAVIS: I'm with Percy on that.

02:38:59.883 --> 02:39:00.979
MARISHA: That was also years ago!

02:39:00.979 --> 02:39:05.275
TALIESIN: No, we have a very-- fine! We still have
a perfectly reasonable reason for not telling

02:39:05.275 --> 02:39:08.740
anyone, which is that if we tell people the city
gets destroyed.

02:39:08.740 --> 02:39:10.091
LAURA: And they get destroyed!

02:39:10.091 --> 02:39:14.065
TALIESIN: You are welcome to tell her, and then we
have to deal with the city being destroyed.

02:39:14.065 --> 02:39:18.570
TRAVIS: Plus, Kima is a total bash brother, and if
she gets to find out she gets to kill two dragons

02:39:18.570 --> 02:39:21.202
instead of one, I don't think she's going to be
upset.

02:39:21.202 --> 02:39:24.945
SAM: I don't know, we're putting her in a lot of
danger.

02:39:24.945 --> 02:39:27.213
TALIESIN: As opposed to staying here.

02:39:27.213 --> 02:39:31.657
MARISHA: And we were aware, and we could have told
her. She going to be angry at not telling her the

02:39:31.657 --> 02:39:32.628
full parameters.

02:39:32.628 --> 02:39:33.552
TALIESIN: She will.

02:39:33.552 --> 02:39:36.862
TRAVIS: Yeah, did see her, though? She's sweaty.
She's working on the outside of houses.

02:39:36.862 --> 02:39:38.814
MARISHA: This is not someone we want to lose our
trust.

02:39:38.814 --> 02:39:44.110
SAM: She could help protect the city, it could go
under siege.

02:39:44.110 --> 02:39:47.289
TALIESIN: She's a soldier. They're used to not
being told things.

02:39:47.289 --> 02:39:54.264
MARISHA: No, she is not a soldier in our
manifested army! She is our friend and ally. There

02:39:54.264 --> 02:39:57.171
is a difference right now. This is a different
duty and relationship.

02:39:57.171 --> 02:39:59.639
LAURA: I feel like I got us into this, and I'm
really sorry about that.

02:39:59.639 --> 02:40:02.639
SAM: We can get her out of it really quickly.

02:40:02.639 --> 02:40:04.477
TALIESIN: We can tell her not to come.

02:40:04.477 --> 02:40:07.020
SAM: We can tell her that it never happened.

02:40:07.020 --> 02:40:14.393
TRAVIS: You saw how excited she was! It's her
choice! If she's our friend and ally, let her choose.

02:40:14.393 --> 02:40:18.750
SAM: She'll choose a fight every time.

02:40:18.750 --> 02:40:19.745
TRAVIS: Yeah!

02:40:19.745 --> 02:40:23.837
MARISHA: But she'll choose a fight unaware of
exactly what she's getting into.

02:40:23.837 --> 02:40:29.248
TALIESIN: Well, we can make that clear, then. Tell
her that there are aspects of this fight that

02:40:29.248 --> 02:40:33.933
sadly must remain secret, that it's far more
dangerous than we could possibly even explain--

02:40:33.933 --> 02:40:35.247
TRAVIS: Yep, what he said.

02:40:35.247 --> 02:40:38.499
TALIESIN: And that things may go completely
tits-up.

02:40:38.499 --> 02:40:43.156
MARISHA: This is Lady Kima we are talking about!
She is one of the most hard-headed people we know.

02:40:43.156 --> 02:40:46.156
She is going to push until we tell her what
happened.

02:40:46.156 --> 02:40:48.349
TALIESIN: Even if we tell her the truth, she's
still going to want to come.

02:40:48.349 --> 02:40:55.168
MARISHA: So then either we tell her the truth and
trust that she can keep a secret, or she doesn't

02:40:55.168 --> 02:40:59.425
come. She's going to find out, and I don't want to
lose her trust.

02:40:59.425 --> 02:41:00.815
TALIESIN: I don't want to tell her.

02:41:00.815 --> 02:41:02.121
MARISHA: Percy--

02:41:02.121 --> 02:41:07.765
TALIESIN: No, I'm happy for her not to come
because I don't want to tell her, because I don't trust--

02:41:07.765 --> 02:41:10.707
MARISHA: I don't trust anyone right now.

02:41:10.707 --> 02:41:14.546
TALIESIN: I barely trust &lt;i&gt;us&lt;/i&gt; to keep this secret,
let alone another person.

02:41:14.546 --> 02:41:18.380
TRAVIS: Oh my god, honestly. All right. To a
vote.

02:41:18.380 --> 02:41:21.066
LAURA: What are we voting on?

02:41:21.066 --> 02:41:23.911
TRAVIS: Whether we bring Kima or not.

02:41:23.911 --> 02:41:30.059
MARISHA: She's going to be mad at us either way,
so it depends on if she's mad at us now or even

02:41:30.059 --> 02:41:31.753
more angry at us later.

02:41:31.753 --> 02:41:37.755
TRAVIS: I want her to fight a dragon. All those in
favor of Kima &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; going to fight a dragon, raise

02:41:37.755 --> 02:41:46.206
your hand. All those in favor of Kima &lt;i&gt;going&lt;/i&gt; to
fight a dragon, raise your hand.

02:41:46.206 --> 02:41:49.777
LAURA: You're abstaining?

02:41:49.777 --> 02:41:50.975
LIAM: I'm not there.

02:41:50.975 --> 02:41:52.016
LAURA: Oh shit!

02:41:52.016 --> 02:41:54.131
TRAVIS: I grab my earring. I'm like, Vax, where
are you? Can you hear me?

02:41:54.131 --> 02:41:56.680
LIAM: I'm sure I'm more than 500 feet away.

02:41:56.680 --> 02:41:57.650
MATT: Yeah.

02:41:57.650 --> 02:42:04.436
MARISHA: Well, look, she's then going to wonder
why we uninvited her. We are lying to her no

02:42:04.436 --> 02:42:06.164
matter which way we take right now.

02:42:06.164 --> 02:42:08.394
SAM: If you want I can wipe her memory of the fact
that we offered--

02:42:08.394 --> 02:42:09.780
TRAVIS: Oh my god!

02:42:09.780 --> 02:42:13.862
LAURA: If she finds out, she is going to be really
super pissed.

02:42:13.862 --> 02:42:15.421
TALIESIN: I'm okay with this plan.

02:42:15.421 --> 02:42:18.240
TRAVIS: Removing an ally from a fight.

02:42:18.240 --> 02:42:20.592
LAURA: I feel like she should come.

02:42:20.592 --> 02:42:26.175
TRAVIS: Taking one of the guns and going, nah! I
want that gun to trust me.

02:42:26.175 --> 02:42:31.910
MARISHA: Look, I want her there more than
anything. I don't want to lie to her and I also

02:42:31.910 --> 02:42:37.300
don't want her dead and I don't want to drag her
into a situation she could have known more about.

02:42:37.300 --> 02:42:42.005
SAM: I defer to the Grand Poobah's will. I will
change my vote to yes.

02:42:42.005 --> 02:42:44.177
TRAVIS: There could be ears listening.

02:42:44.177 --> 02:42:47.346
SAM: I know. Don't worry, I'll wipe their minds,
too. Let's bring her.

02:42:47.346 --> 02:42:48.690
TALIESIN: You really won't.

02:42:48.690 --> 02:42:49.880
LAURA: Let's do it.

02:42:49.880 --> 02:42:50.828
MARISHA: So we're bringing her?

02:42:50.828 --> 02:42:54.067
SAM: Yes. And what's our plan? Do we go to sleep
and wake up and go? How do we get there?

02:42:54.067 --> 02:42:57.309
TALIESIN: We go in the morning.

02:42:57.309 --> 02:42:59.573
SAM: How are we getting there?

02:42:59.573 --> 02:43:00.813
LAURA: Tree Stride.

02:43:00.813 --> 02:43:04.778
SAM: We're going to burn her spell in the morning
to get there? Shouldn't we go now, sleep there?

02:43:04.778 --> 02:43:10.371
TALIESIN: No, I was assuming we would go there
tomorrow, set everything up, and then have it

02:43:10.371 --> 02:43:14.398
happen the day after. We can go camp in our house,
deep in--

02:43:14.398 --> 02:43:20.317
SAM: With Raishan? In &lt;i&gt;my&lt;/i&gt; house? Raishan's not
getting in the mansion, ever.

02:43:20.317 --> 02:43:27.707
TRAVIS: By the way, that two-week time period we
had. How far into that are we?

02:43:27.707 --> 02:43:29.181
SAM: Two days?

02:43:29.181 --> 02:43:31.355
MATT: Yeah, you got a handful of days left.

02:43:31.355 --> 02:43:32.973
TRAVIS: Okay. Just checking.

02:43:32.973 --> 02:43:39.313
TALIESIN: We go there, we set up. Raishan can
handle herself.

02:43:39.313 --> 02:43:42.394
SAM: Fine, let's go.

02:43:42.394 --> 02:43:45.415
MARISHA: We're going? Well, you know what? I've
got to handle something first.

02:43:45.415 --> 02:43:46.783
SAM: Oh boy.

02:43:46.783 --> 02:43:54.343
MATT: While this is happening: Vax. Eventually,
you find your way to the makeshift training

02:43:54.343 --> 02:44:03.397
barracks that are established on the northeastern
side of the city where Kashaw was earlier training

02:44:03.397 --> 02:44:07.638
recruits. You can see now that this late in the
afternoon, most of the training has come to a

02:44:07.638 --> 02:44:14.607
halt, but Jarett is still in the process right now
of instructing Kynan. Kynan has been given more

02:44:14.607 --> 02:44:25.534
standard Whitestone armor to get rid of the dark,
roguish look that he had before, partially to help

02:44:25.534 --> 02:44:32.882
him mentally feel like he's in a different place
and has some connection to the city. But Jarett is

02:44:32.882 --> 02:44:40.340
in the process now of working him through some
swordplay. As you approach, the two of them stop

02:44:40.340 --> 02:44:47.106
and Jarett looks over towards you. "Ah, Vax, it is
good to see you. What can we do for you?"

02:44:47.106 --> 02:44:49.947
LIAM: Well, first, how's he coming along?

02:44:49.947 --> 02:44:54.919
MATT: "Well he's a bit rough around the edges, but
he's actually a pretty decently trained fighter."

02:44:54.919 --> 02:44:57.907
LIAM: Yeah, I'd agree with that.

02:44:57.907 --> 02:44:59.344
MATT: Kynan's quiet.

02:44:59.344 --> 02:45:07.378
LIAM: I'm on de Rolo business right now. Can I
borrow the boy?

02:45:07.378 --> 02:45:09.443
MATT: "I don't know. Do you want to be borrowed?"

02:45:09.443 --> 02:45:14.887
"I suppose. Did I do anything?"

02:45:14.887 --> 02:45:17.402
LIAM: No, you're fine. Take a walk with me?

02:45:17.402 --> 02:45:18.854
MATT: "Sure."

02:45:18.854 --> 02:45:20.437
LIAM: I need to head back to the castle.

02:45:20.437 --> 02:45:25.450
MATT: "Let me just--" And he hands the blade over
to Jarett, who takes it and sheathes it on the side.

02:45:25.450 --> 02:45:28.894
LIAM: Jarett. He'll be back tomorrow for a little
more, all right?

02:45:28.894 --> 02:45:37.599
MAT: "All right. I shall prepare. Don't do
anything stupid, boy." He smiles, and comes up and

02:45:37.599 --> 02:45:42.493
starts walking with you but keeps about a foot and
a half, two feet between the two of you. He seems

02:45:42.493 --> 02:45:45.595
to still be putting a boundary there.

02:45:45.595 --> 02:46:03.767
LIAM: Hey. Listen to me. I wanted to give you a
little more time. I wanted to. And I don't think

02:46:03.767 --> 02:46:14.155
we have it. Things are moving fast. You didn't
know what was going on. I don't fault you; I fault

02:46:14.155 --> 02:46:32.840
myself. That day you showed up-- look at me. I had
a point, but I made sport of you while making it,

02:46:32.840 --> 02:46:41.477
and that is on me. And I'm sorry for it.

02:46:41.477 --> 02:47:01.570
MATT: "I'm sorry, too. I should have taken it for
the lesson it was, and I was too dumb and young to

02:47:01.570 --> 02:47:04.979
"let it get through my thick skull."

02:47:04.979 --> 02:47:14.208
LIAM: Hey, man. I'm a little bit older than you,
but I'm a massive fucking shithead. I've made

02:47:14.208 --> 02:47:20.809
plenty of mistakes, and I only knew how easy it
was for shit to blow up in your face, and now it

02:47:20.809 --> 02:47:29.698
has. Percival and I want to offer you a means of
squaring yourself off.

02:47:29.698 --> 02:47:34.809
MATT: "What do you need?"

02:47:34.809 --> 02:47:46.557
LIAM: This city is in danger, and it needs people
watching it, and I know you're training. Percy--

02:47:46.557 --> 02:47:57.271
I'm sorry, Percival-- has a task for you, and I
think it's well suited for you. You were around

02:47:57.271 --> 02:48:04.939
Ripley, you were around her other men, and you
know how to use a sidearm.

02:48:04.939 --> 02:48:13.571
MATT: "I've toyed with it. I wouldn't say I'm a
great shot, by any means."

02:48:13.571 --> 02:48:18.809
LIAM: Sure. But the number of people who know how
to use those things I can count on two hands.

02:48:18.809 --> 02:48:26.379
Here. We have guns now. We need people to use
them, so I want you to come and talk to Percival

02:48:26.379 --> 02:48:32.399
for a bit, and we're going to work out a plan for
you to show some people the ropes.

02:48:32.399 --> 02:48:35.677
MATT: "All right. Okay."

02:48:35.677 --> 02:48:50.368
LIAM: This is your second chance. I don't doubt
you're going to make the best of it. I truly do

02:48:50.368 --> 02:48:56.021
not. And again, I was going to wait on this,
because I can see the pain in your eyes, but there

02:48:56.021 --> 02:49:04.604
isn't time. And I want you to be well equipped, so
I want you to take these. And I hand him two of

02:49:04.604 --> 02:49:11.433
the three daggers that I bought that day, and I
take out the Keen Dagger, which requires

02:49:11.433 --> 02:49:22.712
attunement. These are mine, and now they're yours.
Water under the bridge, and I don't want to hear a

02:49:22.712 --> 02:49:25.245
word, just walk with me to de Rolo.

02:49:25.245 --> 02:49:31.807
MATT: "Okay. Thank you."

02:49:31.807 --> 02:49:35.974
LIAM: I'm sorry.

02:49:35.974 --> 02:49:46.084
MATT: "I'm sorry." He walks along with you,
eventually leading you back to Percy's workshop

02:49:46.084 --> 02:49:52.390
where the instruction is given for the weapons.
Anything beyond that he doesn't understand about

02:49:52.390 --> 02:50:02.417
the rifles. Nothing construction, general
outfitting. He seems to be more of an adept

02:50:02.417 --> 02:50:05.694
student than you expected. He's got some intellect
to him, at the very least, he can pick up the

02:50:05.694 --> 02:50:10.166
details pretty quick. Quick learner, when he puts
his mind to it.

02:50:10.166 --> 02:50:20.699
About this time, as you're having this discussion,
you can hear the bounding of armored feet, and

02:50:20.699 --> 02:50:26.651
bursting through the partially open door you see,
fully armored, eager, hair pulled back in a tight

02:50:26.651 --> 02:50:35.945
braid, big old maul scraping on the stone behind
her. "All right. When are we doing this?"

02:50:35.945 --> 02:50:37.953
TALIESIN: Tomorrow.

02:50:37.953 --> 02:50:40.601
MATT: "Tomorrow? That's--"

02:50:40.601 --> 02:50:43.411
(laughter)

02:50:43.411 --> 02:50:47.728
MATT: "Does it &lt;i&gt;have&lt;/i&gt; to be tomorrow?"

02:50:47.728 --> 02:50:49.710
SAM: Why, what are you doing tomorrow?

02:50:49.710 --> 02:50:51.789
MATT: "It's really quiet here. I'm getting
extremely bored."

02:50:51.789 --> 02:50:53.190
SAM: Oh. You want to go now?

02:50:53.190 --> 02:50:55.952
MATT: "I mean, whenever you need to, I'm just
saying--"

02:50:55.952 --> 02:50:58.508
SAM: We could go now and camp there.

02:50:58.508 --> 02:51:04.459
TALIESIN: That'll give Kik a chance to replenish.

02:51:04.459 --> 02:51:08.008
LAURA: Yeah, that's true.

02:51:08.008 --> 02:51:13.451
MARISHA: I don't see any difference in Raishan
being able to kill us in our sleep here or there.

02:51:13.451 --> 02:51:18.003
LIAM: She could stay in the shittiest room in the
mansion, Scanlan.

02:51:18.003 --> 02:51:22.517
SAM: She's not getting in the mansion. She can go
sit in the fucking snow and go to sleep, for all I care.

02:51:22.517 --> 02:51:24.840
MATT: "I'm very confused right now."

02:51:24.840 --> 02:51:26.746
SAM: Oh.

02:51:26.746 --> 02:51:27.914
LIAM: Do the thing.

02:51:27.914 --> 02:51:32.314
(laughter)

02:51:32.314 --> 02:51:34.307
LAURA: It's only ten minutes now. It's only ten
fucking minutes.

02:51:34.307 --> 02:51:40.405
SAM: The whole shebang, or just what we said right
now? Just what we just said right now, just that? Great.

02:51:40.405 --> 02:51:44.095
TALIESIN: No, wait! Might as well test the
waters.

02:51:44.095 --> 02:51:47.677
SAM: Okay, yeah. Good. Nine minutes and counting.

02:51:47.677 --> 02:51:51.801
MATT: "Okay, hang on, whoa. I need some
clarification here." The hammer slams down onto

02:51:51.801 --> 02:51:53.148
the stonework.

02:51:53.148 --> 02:51:59.152
TALIESIN: Shut the door, lock it. This is not how
I wanted this to go down, but apparently this is

02:51:59.152 --> 02:52:04.595
how it's happening-- wait a minute. Your boy is
gone by now, right? We sent him out.

02:52:04.595 --> 02:52:06.139
LAURA: He's gone.

02:52:06.139 --> 02:52:10.146
MATT: (laughs) No, you guys were teaching him
about the guns when she came back.

02:52:10.146 --> 02:52:13.339
LIAM: You never know when it's out of character or
in character--

02:52:13.381 --> 02:52:18.085
MATT: Mind you, he seems largely confused and
doesn't seem to know what's going on.

02:52:18.085 --> 02:52:25.006
TALIESIN: I'm going to go take the boy for a
stroll and show him how this is going to work and

02:52:25.006 --> 02:52:30.413
explain to him everything. Gentlemen, you actually
plan how we're going to kill dragons. Excuse me.

02:52:30.413 --> 02:52:34.768
Give me strength.

02:52:34.768 --> 02:52:40.374
LIAM: All right, quickly. Kima, we need to talk to
you about something very important, and if it

02:52:40.374 --> 02:52:42.361
doesn't go well, Scanlan is going to erase your
memory, but--

02:52:42.361 --> 02:52:44.992
MATT: "Excuse me?!"

02:52:44.992 --> 02:52:46.641
SAM: I can do crazy things.

02:52:46.641 --> 02:52:49.139
MATT: "No, nobody's doing that to me!"

02:52:49.139 --> 02:52:57.640
LIAM: Of course not, because you are so cool. Cool
as a cucumber. We're in a bit of a predicament. We

02:52:57.640 --> 02:53:04.879
are going to Draconia so that you can fight not
one but two dragons. Here's the thing: one of the

02:53:04.879 --> 02:53:07.996
dragons is here right now, is coming with us in
disguise--

02:53:07.996 --> 02:53:10.249
MATT: Immediately the maul gets grabbed, she says,
"Here?"

02:53:10.249 --> 02:53:12.543
LAURA: No, I think you're doing it wrong.
Scanlan--

02:53:12.543 --> 02:53:13.774
LIAM: We've got eight more minutes!

02:53:13.774 --> 02:53:15.047
LAURA: No, we don't.

02:53:15.047 --> 02:53:22.569
SAM: Lady Kima. We, in order to kill one dragon,
are entering into a deal with another.

02:53:22.569 --> 02:53:24.465
LIAM: Before we kill it.

02:53:24.465 --> 02:53:26.994
MATT: "Are you crazy?!"

02:53:26.994 --> 02:53:28.592
TRAVIS: I know, that's what I said.

02:53:28.592 --> 02:53:29.980
LAURA: Pure stupidity.

02:53:29.980 --> 02:53:31.267
MATT: "Obviously, yes!"

02:53:31.267 --> 02:53:32.730
TRAVIS: Hear him out.

02:53:32.730 --> 02:53:43.036
SAM: If we do this, it could help us kill the
dragon that killed Tiberius.

02:53:43.036 --> 02:53:45.892
MATT: "And you think you can trust this dragon?"

02:53:45.892 --> 02:53:47.707
ALL: No.

02:53:47.707 --> 02:53:52.697
MATT: "Come on, guys!"

02:53:52.697 --> 02:53:58.464
TRAVIS: All right, look. The dragon is actually
poisoned by a curse. She's very weak.

02:53:58.464 --> 02:54:00.484
MATT: "Great! Perfect!"

02:54:00.484 --> 02:54:02.703
TRAVIS: We plan to take advantage of that.

02:54:02.703 --> 02:54:06.059
MATT: "Why don't we kill the dragon here, and then
kill the other dragon &lt;i&gt;there&lt;/i&gt;--"

02:54:06.059 --> 02:54:09.834
LAURA: She'll fuck up Whitestone. It'll give us
away. We have to get away from the city.

02:54:09.834 --> 02:54:18.414
SAM: Lady Kima, you're looking at a group of
idiots who have felled dragons, killed beholders,

02:54:18.414 --> 02:54:25.409
negotiated with sphinxes, gone to other realms and
other planes, and somehow managed to get out of it

02:54:25.409 --> 02:54:27.122
more or less alive.

02:54:27.122 --> 02:54:30.350
MATT: "You are a lucky bunch of sons-of-bitches,
that I'll give to you!"

02:54:30.350 --> 02:54:32.183
LIAM: You know what also this is like?

02:54:32.183 --> 02:54:34.032
LAURA: I'm keeping an eye on the time.

02:54:34.032 --> 02:54:36.155
MATT: She leans on her hammer.

02:54:36.155 --> 02:54:41.992
LIAM: This is what this is like: this is just like
the Underdark, with one exception. We worked with

02:54:41.992 --> 02:54:48.836
that fucking asshole thinking he might have some
redeeming qualities and he didn't, he turned on

02:54:48.836 --> 02:54:49.786
us, right?

02:54:49.786 --> 02:54:53.081
MATT: "Yeah, and who told you that? Who told you
that was going to happen? Who at the very first

02:54:53.081 --> 02:54:56.572
"moment you showed him to me said, 'This guy is
going to try and kill you?'"

02:54:56.572 --> 02:55:00.746
LIAM: But on the side, he helped us get as far as
he did, but then he got shot through the head, but

02:55:00.746 --> 02:55:06.980
that's water under the bridge! &lt;i&gt;This&lt;/i&gt; time, we
know that we're dealing with a fucking piece of

02:55:06.980 --> 02:55:14.281
shit. We're going to turn on the piece of shit and
kill her. The whole plan is to get them all to

02:55:14.281 --> 02:55:18.803
turn on each other, and then we mop up the messy
bits afterwards.

02:55:18.803 --> 02:55:20.073
TALIESIN: Seven minutes!

02:55:20.073 --> 02:55:25.145
LIAM: One dragon or two dragons? You want to play?
Let's play.

02:55:25.145 --> 02:55:30.242
SAM: Or you can let us go into this without you.
And probably all die.

02:55:30.242 --> 02:55:32.287
MATT: "Yeah, you're all going to die!"

02:55:32.287 --> 02:55:34.278
TRAVIS: Oh.

02:55:34.278 --> 02:55:36.174
LIAM: You were ready to run with us, girl!

02:55:36.174 --> 02:55:39.041
MATT: "Oh, I'm coming with you, because I'm not
going to let you die!"

02:55:39.041 --> 02:55:40.209
SAM: Oh, you are?

02:55:40.209 --> 02:55:51.212
MATT: "God. Stupid bunch of gits, I swear.
Bahamut, are you serious? (scoffs) This is

02:55:51.212 --> 02:55:56.076
"ridiculous. I'm not going to tell anyone you made
this plan until it's done, because this is

02:55:56.076 --> 02:55:57.961
"&lt;i&gt;stupid&lt;/i&gt; as &lt;i&gt;shit&lt;/i&gt;."

02:55:57.961 --> 02:56:03.884
SAM: It could be. But with you by our side, it has
a slightly better chance of going correct.

02:56:03.884 --> 02:56:04.942
MATT: "Yes, it does."

02:56:04.942 --> 02:56:06.481
LIAM: Kimmy, can you be cool?

02:56:06.481 --> 02:56:07.761
MATT: "Please don't call me that."

02:56:07.761 --> 02:56:08.983
SAM: Lil' Kim.

02:56:08.983 --> 02:56:11.383
LIAM: Can you be cool?

02:56:11.383 --> 02:56:14.323
MATT: "Where's the dragon?"

02:56:14.323 --> 02:56:17.635
LAURA: It's in Draconia.

02:56:17.635 --> 02:56:20.727
TALIESIN: Six minutes.

02:56:20.727 --> 02:56:22.375
MATT: "What about the one that's here?"

02:56:22.375 --> 02:56:24.289
LAURA: It's hiding.

02:56:24.289 --> 02:56:25.497
MATT: "Hiding?"

02:56:25.497 --> 02:56:28.494
LIAM: It's going to show up after the fact. In
Draconia.

02:56:28.494 --> 02:56:33.014
MATT: "So this whole deal, you just don't trust me
enough to tell me where the dragon's sleeping in

02:56:33.014 --> 02:56:36.095
"our place right now? You're all acting very
weird."

02:56:36.095 --> 02:56:37.510
TRAVIS: We made a deal.

02:56:37.510 --> 02:56:42.209
SAM: It's for your own protection. We can't tell
you everything.

02:56:42.209 --> 02:56:46.339
LAURA: What if you go running off? What if you go
try to kill it in here, and Whitestone gets

02:56:46.339 --> 02:56:47.872
destroyed?

02:56:47.872 --> 02:56:49.993
MATT: "Please."

02:56:49.993 --> 02:56:52.928
LAURA: It's a temptation. Believe me, we know.

02:56:52.928 --> 02:56:56.389
MATT: "It is very tempting, trust me, yes it is.
But I'm also not stupid."

02:56:56.389 --> 02:56:58.124
SAM: After all we've been through--

02:56:58.124 --> 02:57:01.816
LIAM: We've all almost died a hundred times.

02:57:01.816 --> 02:57:11.775
SAM: We're asking you to trust us blindly in this
scenario, and I know that it's not ideal, but we

02:57:11.775 --> 02:57:13.726
have saved you before.

02:57:13.726 --> 02:57:20.379
MARISHA: And Kima, please remember: between me and
you, of all people, before we trusted the

02:57:20.379 --> 02:57:23.205
illithid, we trusted you.

02:57:23.205 --> 02:57:24.764
LAURA: Well &lt;i&gt;we&lt;/i&gt; trusted her.

02:57:24.764 --> 02:57:27.902
MARISHA: You're right. I didn't trust you.

02:57:27.902 --> 02:57:29.805
MATT: "I was about to say--"

02:57:29.805 --> 02:57:41.147
MARISHA: They trusted you. I didn't. I'm getting
to my point! But we grew past that, and now I

02:57:41.147 --> 02:57:44.954
trust you more implicitly than most people in this
world.

02:57:44.954 --> 02:57:46.206
MATT: "Good."

02:57:46.206 --> 02:57:48.647
TALIESIN: This is precisely why you people need
me!

02:57:48.647 --> 02:57:54.599
LIAM: I think all these words are fucking it up.
She seems down. I think we should just get it on.

02:57:54.599 --> 02:57:59.319
LAURA: Here's the thing, though: you have to
pretend like you don't know. It's super

02:57:59.319 --> 02:58:00.584
important.

02:58:00.584 --> 02:58:02.026
LIAM: Right. Can you be cool?

02:58:02.026 --> 02:58:04.167
MATT: "You're asking me to lie?"

02:58:04.167 --> 02:58:07.726
LAURA: Well. Pretend.

02:58:07.726 --> 02:58:11.362
MATT: "I'm not real good at lying."

02:58:11.362 --> 02:58:14.093
TRAVIS: How about you just don't say anything?

02:58:14.093 --> 02:58:15.292
MATT: "That I can do."

02:58:15.292 --> 02:58:19.765
LAURA: Okay. Perfect. And don't attack.

02:58:19.765 --> 02:58:22.348
TALIESIN: Four minutes.

02:58:22.348 --> 02:58:23.702
SAM: Should I wipe her memory?

02:58:23.702 --> 02:58:24.622
TRAVIS and LAURA: No.

02:58:24.622 --> 02:58:26.332
SAM: Might be easier, at this point.

02:58:26.332 --> 02:58:27.563
TRAVIS: No, we're good.

02:58:27.563 --> 02:58:31.965
MATT: "You come near me with any sort of magic
mumbo-jumbo, I'm going to clock you in the head, Scanlan."

02:58:31.965 --> 02:58:34.983
SAM: Lady Kima, I don't know what you're talking
about.

02:58:34.983 --> 02:58:42.927
MATT: "I love you, but I'm going to clock you in
the head if you try and wipe my memory, little gnome."

02:58:42.927 --> 02:58:47.042
LIAM: Kima. We've got three minutes left. Kima.

02:58:47.042 --> 02:58:48.449
MATT: "Until what?!"

02:58:48.449 --> 02:58:51.453
LAURA: He can choose any ten minutes he wants,
really.

02:58:51.453 --> 02:58:56.295
LIAM: That's true. You know our mind, you know
what our plan is. You're kind of a firebrand, do

02:58:56.295 --> 02:59:01.247
you think it might be better for you not to know--
you know now, but to not know going in and then

02:59:01.247 --> 02:59:04.551
you kill everything on sight when we're there?

02:59:04.551 --> 02:59:08.377
MATT: "I have no idea what you're talking about,
and this is really starting to frustrate me. Are

02:59:08.377 --> 02:59:09.580
"we going to kill a dragon?"

02:59:09.580 --> 02:59:10.618
LAURA and TRAVIS: Yes.

02:59:10.618 --> 02:59:11.692
MATT: "We're going to kill two dragons?"

02:59:11.692 --> 02:59:12.864
LIAM: One to two dragons, yes.

02:59:12.864 --> 02:59:14.167
MATT: "Great, okay. What's the plan?"

02:59:14.167 --> 02:59:15.926
TRAVIS: We leave tonight.

02:59:15.926 --> 02:59:16.982
LAURA: We go.

02:59:16.982 --> 02:59:22.398
SAM: We go where the dragon is, we're going to
release bait. When the dragon is done with the

02:59:22.398 --> 02:59:24.160
bait, we go in and kill the dragon.

02:59:24.160 --> 02:59:25.331
TRAVIS: Yep, pretty much.

02:59:25.331 --> 02:59:26.539
LIAM: And then another dragon.

02:59:26.539 --> 02:59:28.853
SAM: Maybe a third after that.

02:59:28.853 --> 02:59:35.105
LAURA: If we're totally weak, though, we can't
fight the second dragon right away, we have to

02:59:35.105 --> 02:59:38.271
save up our strength and then fight her after so
we don't die.

02:59:38.271 --> 02:59:48.217
MATT: "I'm not going to lie, I admire your drive
and gusto. Just be smart about this."

02:59:48.217 --> 02:59:52.304
TALIESIN: Look at that, she says she can't lie,
and there she did it so well.

02:59:52.304 --> 02:59:53.491
SAM: I thought you were gone.

02:59:53.491 --> 02:59:57.572
TALIESIN: I'm listening in to this whole thing
through the earphone as I'm talking. That's how I

02:59:57.572 --> 03:00:01.527
keep telling you how long you have, because I'm
laughing &lt;i&gt;so&lt;/i&gt; much.

03:00:01.527 --> 03:00:02.872
MATT: "All right. Well, then."

03:00:02.872 --> 03:00:04.619
MARISHA: I'm going to go talk to the Sun Tree.

03:00:04.619 --> 03:00:07.351
SAM: I thought we were going? We're leaving now?

03:00:07.351 --> 03:00:09.132
MARISHA: Just gather your shit. I'll meet you
there.

03:00:09.132 --> 03:00:10.301
SAM: Where?

03:00:10.301 --> 03:00:12.192
TALIESIN and MARISHA: The Sun Tree.

03:00:12.192 --> 03:00:13.550
LIAM: She's our ticket there.

03:00:13.550 --> 03:00:16.846
LAURA: Don't talk to anyone, Kima.

03:00:16.846 --> 03:00:19.455
MATT: "If we're leaving soon, I'm sticking with
you guys."

03:00:19.455 --> 03:00:27.078
TALIESIN: I'm going to let Asum in on our plan.

03:00:27.078 --> 03:00:32.361
LIAM: Hey, Scanlan, could you wipe Kynan's memory,
please?

03:00:32.361 --> 03:00:33.576
SAM: Kynan?

03:00:33.576 --> 03:00:34.482
LIAM: Yeah, he's here.

03:00:34.482 --> 03:00:35.851
SAM: Kynan didn't really hear anything.

03:00:35.851 --> 03:00:37.010
TALIESIN: No, I left with him.

03:00:37.010 --> 03:00:38.023
LIAM: You left with him?

03:00:38.023 --> 03:00:39.506
TALIESIN: I haven't been in the room because I
took him away.

03:00:39.506 --> 03:00:40.894
LIAM: I redact that statement. Excellent.

03:00:40.894 --> 03:00:43.673
LAURA: Yeah, that's why Percy left.

03:00:43.673 --> 03:00:45.831
LIAM: I see. I was focused on the fire--

03:00:45.831 --> 03:00:51.184
TALIESIN: Oh, no. I've walked Kynan to show him
how I would like things to function.

03:00:51.184 --> 03:00:55.607
MATT: Yeah, and as you're listening in you gave
him all the instruction and he takes it in pretty

03:00:55.607 --> 03:01:02.959
well. Jarett catches up with you, and you both
coordinate with that. All right. You head to the

03:01:02.959 --> 03:01:05.184
Sun Tree while the rest of you gather the rest of
your materials and supplies.

03:01:05.184 --> 03:01:13.719
LAURA: I'm going to-- well, if we have time. I'm
going to attune my cold-snap armor to me, so I'll

03:01:13.719 --> 03:01:17.431
probably not have my bracers attuned.

03:01:17.431 --> 03:01:23.139
MATT: Okay, so that's two damage off any of your
ranged attacks. So keep note of that.

03:01:23.139 --> 03:01:26.163
LAURA: But I get, what, cold resistance and added
AC, or something?

03:01:26.163 --> 03:01:35.450
TALIESIN: I'm going to attune Animus and drop the
gloves of missile snaring for this fight.

03:01:35.450 --> 03:01:37.813
LIAM: Free wet willies.

03:01:37.813 --> 03:01:48.638
MATT: As you attune the weapon, there's a brief
familiar dark glow on the weapon, and all the

03:01:48.638 --> 03:01:53.327
three names that exist on the barrel all
dissipate. It's now a clean barrel.

03:01:53.327 --> 03:01:59.978
LAURA: Oh no.

03:01:59.978 --> 03:02:10.167
TALIESIN: Well, all right. We'll have to have a
talk about that. Is it all right if I let Asum

03:02:10.167 --> 03:02:12.888
know what our basic plan is?

03:02:12.888 --> 03:02:15.146
SAM: What, that we're leaving now?

03:02:15.146 --> 03:02:21.853
TALIESIN: We're leaving now, we'll be heading
there, the fight will be tomorrow. There will be a

03:02:21.853 --> 03:02:29.441
creature that we will lure and bait the white
dragon with, we will attack at the end. We expect

03:02:29.441 --> 03:02:34.198
to see her participation. If we are not acutely
aware of it, all deals are off.

03:02:34.198 --> 03:02:36.890
LIAM: Sounds good to me.

03:02:36.890 --> 03:02:38.784
TALIESIN: I relay that information.

03:02:38.784 --> 03:02:41.466
MATT: Okay. Do you go to Asum's room?

03:02:41.466 --> 03:02:44.430
TALIESIN: I knock.

03:02:44.430 --> 03:02:46.041
MATT: You knock on the door.

03:02:46.041 --> 03:02:47.204
TALIESIN: Asum?

03:02:47.204 --> 03:02:53.387
MATT: A voice goes, (shushes). You hear lowered
voices from the other side of the door for a

03:02:53.387 --> 03:02:54.843
moment.

03:02:54.843 --> 03:02:59.126
TALIESIN: I walk away, assuming that Asum will
know where to find me.

03:02:59.126 --> 03:03:03.429
TRAVIS: That's it?

03:03:03.429 --> 03:03:10.723
TALIESIN: I go back to gathering my things, pulling
powder and shot out of what was necessary.

03:03:10.723 --> 03:03:17.973
MATT: Okay. About ten minutes go by, and as you're
gathering things Asum approaches. "I'm sorry,

03:03:17.973 --> 03:03:20.297
"Percy. I was indisposed."

03:03:20.297 --> 03:03:25.770
TALIESIN: I apologize. I hope I didn't disrupt
anything important.

03:03:25.770 --> 03:03:35.212
MATT: "No. I was keen enough to cover, but both
the Cinder King and the Frigid Doom are under the

03:03:35.212 --> 03:03:38.300
"impression that there is no mounting danger."

03:03:38.300 --> 03:03:43.679
TALIESIN: Tonight, we go to Draconia.

03:03:43.679 --> 03:03:45.749
MATT: "Very well."

03:03:45.749 --> 03:03:54.685
TALIESIN: Tomorrow, we fight the dragon. We will
bait him with another creature of great strength--

03:03:54.685 --> 03:04:00.864
MATT: "Might I ask what creature of great strength
you intend to bait Vorugal with?"

03:04:00.864 --> 03:04:06.550
TALIESIN: I don't think anything you've ever heard
of before.

03:04:06.550 --> 03:04:08.267
MATT: "Try me."

03:04:08.267 --> 03:04:19.643
TALIESIN: What the hell. I pull out the book and
show him the picture.

03:04:19.643 --> 03:04:21.080
SAM: (whispering) Her.

03:04:21.080 --> 03:04:22.735
TALIESIN: Sorry. Thank you.

03:04:22.735 --> 03:04:24.449
LAURA: Well, it's Asum right now.

03:04:24.449 --> 03:04:25.968
LIAM: It's confusing, man.

03:04:25.968 --> 03:04:27.798
TALIESIN: Yeah. There's a lot of gender issues in
this.

03:04:27.798 --> 03:04:31.748
MATT: "Reaching into the Abyss! That's curious."

03:04:31.748 --> 03:04:39.556
TALIESIN: I figured that quite possibly, in
private, you and I have the closest dispositions.

03:04:39.556 --> 03:04:43.152
MATT: "I can see that kinship, as well."

03:04:43.152 --> 03:04:51.137
TALIESIN: Once that fight has concluded, we mop up
whatever is left. We expect to see your

03:04:51.137 --> 03:04:56.310
participation in some form. I understand if it
can't be direct.

03:04:56.310 --> 03:05:06.608
MATT: "I can be of aid, I just have to remain
inconspicuous. I cannot be seen to be part of this

03:05:06.608 --> 03:05:08.044
"confrontation."

03:05:08.044 --> 03:05:09.356
TALIESIN: Obviously.

03:05:09.356 --> 03:05:12.777
MATT: "And all shall be fine."

03:05:12.777 --> 03:05:20.466
TALIESIN: We may have some extra people with us,
as well.

03:05:20.466 --> 03:05:26.868
MATT: "This was not discussed. Who would you
intend to bring into this deal?"

03:05:26.868 --> 03:05:37.535
TALIESIN: That, sadly, I cannot inform. Although
there will be Draconians. They are disinterested

03:05:37.535 --> 03:05:38.889
in our politics.

03:05:38.889 --> 03:05:40.183
MATT: "And disposable?"

03:05:40.183 --> 03:05:48.142
TALIESIN: I would hope not. But I understand your
point of view. I will say for the sake of this

03:05:48.142 --> 03:05:57.385
encounter, our point of view will be dominant. But
I understand and respect yours. When dealing with

03:05:57.385 --> 03:06:03.732
ants, you must respect the needs of ants. Surely
you understand?

03:06:03.732 --> 03:06:07.812
MATT: "I follow. All right."

03:06:07.812 --> 03:06:13.111
TALIESIN: So there will be that. We will have a
couple of accompanying members as well, but since

03:06:13.111 --> 03:06:18.401
you're staying hidden, it shouldn't be a problem.
I would recommend not showing up in this form, at

03:06:18.401 --> 03:06:19.505
the very least.

03:06:19.505 --> 03:06:28.469
MATT: "Oh, in this form? I have many forms I can
take. I have an idea. Very well. Fetch me when

03:06:28.469 --> 03:06:29.795
"you're ready."

03:06:29.795 --> 03:06:34.613
TALIESIN: We will be leaving on our own. You will
have to meet us there. I'm sure getting to

03:06:34.613 --> 03:06:37.449
Draconia shouldn't be too much of a problem for
you?

03:06:37.449 --> 03:06:41.832
MATT: "Why not travel with you and your band? That
seems like a waste of magic."

03:06:41.832 --> 03:06:51.642
TALIESIN: It does, but sadly we are trying to keep
our own reality quiet. The needs of ants. And

03:06:51.642 --> 03:06:55.550
also, they don't want you around. They don't trust
you.

03:06:55.550 --> 03:07:02.770
MATT: "I understand that, but if you're going now,
it takes me at least three, four days of travel

03:07:02.770 --> 03:07:04.933
"over the ocean to get to Draconia."

03:07:04.933 --> 03:07:15.512
TALIESIN: Surely you can find a faster way. You
got here very quickly. You so rarely lie that I'm

03:07:15.512 --> 03:07:22.808
so fascinated that when you do, I think I'm
starting to get your tells, just a bit of them.

03:07:22.808 --> 03:07:26.888
MATT: "You're a funny little man."

03:07:26.888 --> 03:07:30.289
TALIESIN: I take that as the highest compliment.

03:07:30.289 --> 03:07:34.439
MATT: "Well, then. I'll see you tomorrow."

03:07:34.439 --> 03:07:36.711
TALIESIN: See you tomorrow.

03:07:36.711 --> 03:07:40.764
MATT: And Asum turns around and exits.

03:07:40.764 --> 03:07:48.442
TALIESIN: I turn the corner, get far enough away,
and drop to my knees and breathe deeply for a

03:07:48.442 --> 03:07:50.031
minute.

03:07:50.031 --> 03:07:52.494
MARISHA: Well done.

03:07:52.494 --> 03:08:00.935
TALIESIN: Head to the Sun Tree.

03:08:00.935 --> 03:08:11.172
MATT: All right. You guys make your way to the Sun
Tree. While you're walking, Keyleth, you head

03:08:11.172 --> 03:08:12.996
there, as well. Is there anything you wanted to do
before they arrive?

03:08:12.996 --> 03:08:20.102
MARISHA: Yes, I wanted to go underneath in our
little Sun Tree cave that we carved out.

03:08:20.102 --> 03:08:23.686
MATT: Okay. So you go beneath the tavern, into the
basement, down into the little tunnel beneath that

03:08:23.686 --> 03:08:25.148
leads to the Sun Tree's roots.

03:08:25.148 --> 03:08:29.560
MARISHA: Yeah. And I cast Commune with Nature.

03:08:29.560 --> 03:08:30.617
MATT: Okay.

03:08:30.617 --> 03:08:48.303
MARISHA: (laughs) There's so much pressure on
this. Is there a way I can put my hand inside the Sun Tree?

03:08:48.303 --> 03:08:49.617
TALIESIN: Wow.

03:08:49.617 --> 03:08:50.894
LAURA: Yeah.

03:08:50.894 --> 03:08:58.215
MATT: It's less of a merger and more as you touch
and connect to the roots, your consciousness and

03:08:58.215 --> 03:08:59.543
the Sun Tree's consciousness can combine.

03:08:59.543 --> 03:09:00.937
LAURA: You're holding the roots.

03:09:00.937 --> 03:09:16.556
TRAVIS: Dear diary--

03:09:16.556 --> 03:09:18.566
LAURA: Today I talked to the Sun Tree.

03:09:18.566 --> 03:09:20.340
MARISHA: Dear Sun Tree--

03:09:20.340 --> 03:09:21.860
SAM: It was so turgid.

03:09:21.860 --> 03:09:23.870
TRAVIS: Turgid?

03:09:23.870 --> 03:09:28.304
TALIESIN: It was an appropriate usage of the word!
Very well done, very good.

03:09:28.304 --> 03:09:29.423
MATT: Yeah!

03:09:29.423 --> 03:09:32.197
MARISHA: Okay, I'm going to cast Commune with
Nature and try and connect with the Sun Tree.

03:09:32.197 --> 03:09:37.670
MATT: You grab the roots and feel the warmth flow
through your hands and there your consciousness

03:09:37.670 --> 03:09:41.807
connects with that of the Sun Tree, and you are
both present in that same plant space.

03:09:41.807 --> 03:09:48.235
MARISHA: Sun Tree?

03:09:48.235 --> 03:09:50.817
MATT: "Hey, Keyleth."

03:09:50.817 --> 03:09:56.180
(giggling)

03:09:56.180 --> 03:09:58.644
MATT: "Been a while."

03:09:58.644 --> 03:10:00.838
MARISHA: Hey Sun Tree.

03:10:00.838 --> 03:10:03.667
MATT: "Hey, Keyleth."

03:10:03.667 --> 03:10:08.264
MARISHA: Without burning a question, can I
personally ask you, how are you doing, man?

03:10:08.264 --> 03:10:10.910
MATT: "Doing all right."

03:10:10.910 --> 03:10:12.411
MARISHA: Yeah?

03:10:12.411 --> 03:10:18.939
MATT: "A little cold, but... Whitestone."

03:10:18.939 --> 03:10:28.394
MARISHA: Okay, man, yeah. Hey, Sun Tree?

03:10:28.394 --> 03:10:30.798
MATT: "Yeah, Keyleth?"

03:10:30.798 --> 03:10:44.424
MARISHA: So you're overtop all these arcane
ley-lines across the whole globe, right? I've

03:10:44.424 --> 03:10:53.671
traveled a lot of places here lately. What are all
the cities that the other arcane ley lines fall across?

03:10:53.671 --> 03:10:58.776
MATT: "I don't rightly know."

03:10:58.776 --> 03:11:01.510
MARISHA: Can I sense it through the Sun Tree's
roots?

03:11:01.510 --> 03:11:07.493
MATT: Which, as he converses with you, he says,
"I've been here a long time. Don't really get

03:11:07.493 --> 03:11:18.883
"around much, being a tree." But you do feel this
light, fuzzy, blue, almost like a mist energy,

03:11:18.883 --> 03:11:25.654
like a particle energy that is coalesced around
Whitestone and above it, and it shoots off in six

03:11:25.654 --> 03:11:29.976
different directions, some that curl up
northwards, some that curl out over the ocean, and

03:11:29.976 --> 03:11:38.295
you see them spider out in places and then go
beyond your peripheral. The ley-lines only spider

03:11:38.295 --> 03:11:43.781
out past the Alabaster Sierras; you can't see much
further than that.

03:11:43.781 --> 03:11:53.682
MARISHA: Are there any cities, any places of
interest I can see that we've been through before,

03:11:53.682 --> 03:11:55.398
where they happen to cross?

03:11:55.398 --> 03:11:57.718
MATT: Let me look at the specifics of Commune with
Nature real fast.

03:11:57.718 --> 03:12:05.033
MARISHA: I'm trying to see if I can use the Sun
Tree to extend my vision a little further.

03:12:05.033 --> 03:12:07.498
MATT: Unfortunately, the spell only lasts for
up to three miles.

03:12:07.498 --> 03:12:11.862
MARISHA: Yeah. I want to extend a little further?

03:12:11.862 --> 03:12:17.241
MATT: You sense that yes, these ley energies do
travel much further and surround the world and

03:12:17.241 --> 03:12:22.645
make a network of various magical pathways, but
unfortunately the Sun Tree and your vision right

03:12:22.645 --> 03:12:31.009
now doesn't go far beyond Whitestone. "Yeah. It
isn't a lot."

03:12:31.009 --> 03:12:42.257
MARISHA: So the ziggurat, the spinning orb of
death that happens to be right underneath you, are

03:12:42.257 --> 03:12:44.654
you in touch with what that might be feeding?

03:12:44.654 --> 03:12:46.635
MATT: "Can't say I do."

03:12:46.635 --> 03:12:48.516
MARISHA: Goddamn it, Sun Tree! Goddamn it!

03:12:48.516 --> 03:12:57.638
MATT: "Keyleth, calm down. I'm happy to answer
your questions, invite you to my space. Just

03:12:57.638 --> 03:13:00.661
"because I'm not an all-seeing tree, don't be angry
with me."

03:13:00.661 --> 03:13:02.877
MARISHA: I'm not angry with &lt;i&gt;you,&lt;/i&gt; Sun Tree.

03:13:02.877 --> 03:13:06.369
MATT: "Angry in general. Just chill."

03:13:06.369 --> 03:13:09.575
MARISHA: That's really easy for you to say, Sun
Tree.

03:13:09.575 --> 03:13:10.821
MATT: "Yeah, it is."

03:13:10.821 --> 03:13:15.828
(laughter)

03:13:15.828 --> 03:13:20.203
MARISHA: Okay. All right. Sun Tree.

03:13:20.203 --> 03:13:22.020
MATT: "Yeah, Keyleth?"

03:13:22.020 --> 03:13:26.500
MARISHA: You're a tree from Pelor, yes?

03:13:26.500 --> 03:13:28.292
MATT: "More or less."

03:13:28.292 --> 03:13:37.291
MARISHA: Have there been the attention of any
other gods on Whitestone right now? That you can

03:13:37.291 --> 03:13:46.096
sense? Or can I sense? I'm asking the Sun Tree out
of humor, but can I sense it? I'm assuming the

03:13:46.096 --> 03:13:48.250
tree doesn't actually know fucking shit.

03:13:48.250 --> 03:13:55.259
MATT: The tree may know a lot, just, the right
questions need to be asked. The Sun Tree says, "To

03:13:55.259 --> 03:14:03.802
"be perfectly honest, Keyleth, even Pelor's grace
left this place hundreds of years ago. His

03:14:03.802 --> 03:14:10.559
"presence is here in bits and pieces, but when I
was first taking seed, the gods were much more

03:14:10.559 --> 03:14:16.724
"present, much easier to read. Kind of lonely
nowadays."

03:14:16.724 --> 03:14:19.474
MARISHA: That's so sad.

03:14:19.474 --> 03:14:22.435
MATT: "I know, Keyleth. I know."

03:14:22.435 --> 03:14:28.567
MARISHA: You've got me, Sun Tree. I'm here. You
shouldn't be lonely.

03:14:28.567 --> 03:14:32.546
MATT: "When you're around, Keyleth, nobody can be
lonely."

03:14:32.546 --> 03:14:36.222
MARISHA: Aww, that's so-- aww.

03:14:36.222 --> 03:14:39.968
LAURA: He's saying that as you're holding on to
his roots.

03:14:39.968 --> 03:14:42.235
MATT: Don't make it weird, Laura.

03:14:42.235 --> 03:14:43.365
LAURA: Sorry.

03:14:43.365 --> 03:14:45.354
LIAM: It was weird five minutes ago, Matt!

03:14:45.354 --> 03:15:00.263
MARISHA: Okay, Sun Tree. I don't think I have much
time left, but is there anything-- you said you're

03:15:00.263 --> 03:15:09.287
lonely. I just want to say if you ever want to
talk, I'm here. You know you can confide in me. If

03:15:09.287 --> 03:15:12.201
there's anything you want to say, I'm all ears,
you know?

03:15:12.201 --> 03:15:14.083
MATT: "I appreciate that."

03:15:14.083 --> 03:15:15.039
MARISHA: Yeah?

03:15:15.039 --> 03:15:16.571
MATT: "You've got to come to me."

03:15:16.571 --> 03:15:21.944
(laughter)

03:15:21.944 --> 03:15:25.243
MATT: "But when you do, hell yeah."

03:15:25.243 --> 03:15:33.625
MARISHA: You know, I didn't really get any of the
things I was looking for, Sun Tree, but I still

03:15:33.625 --> 03:15:35.437
feel a little better. Thank you.

03:15:35.437 --> 03:15:37.326
MATT: "That's all that matters, Keyleth."

03:15:37.326 --> 03:15:40.048
MARISHA: Yeah! You're cool, Sun Tree.

03:15:40.048 --> 03:15:41.868
MATT: "You're cool too, girl."

03:15:41.868 --> 03:15:43.671
MARISHA: Aww! Not as cool as you.

03:15:43.671 --> 03:15:45.234
MATT: "Probably."

03:15:45.234 --> 03:15:49.136
MARISHA: Yeah. Okay, I'm going to be walking
through you here in a minute, so I wanted to let

03:15:49.136 --> 03:15:53.349
you know that there's going to be eight people
going through, so don't feel alarmed.

03:15:53.349 --> 03:15:54.721
MATT: "Oh boy."

03:15:54.721 --> 03:15:56.179
MARISHA: Does that hurt you?

03:15:56.179 --> 03:15:57.630
MATT: "It tingles a little."

03:15:57.630 --> 03:15:58.654
MARISHA: Oh, okay.

03:15:58.654 --> 03:15:59.762
MATT: "That's all right."

03:15:59.762 --> 03:16:02.112
MARISHA: I'm sorry. I'm not going to stop doing
it, but I'm sorry.

03:16:02.112 --> 03:16:04.686
MATT: "I appreciate it."

03:16:04.686 --> 03:16:07.133
MARISHA: All right. Bye, Sun Tree.

03:16:07.133 --> 03:16:09.099
MATT: "Bye, Keyleth."

03:16:09.099 --> 03:16:11.861
LAURA: Has anybody seen Keyleth?

03:16:11.861 --> 03:16:15.127
MATT: As you go up top, the whole group is
gathered there, currently.

03:16:15.127 --> 03:16:17.433
TALIESIN: She's downstairs with her wood.

03:16:17.433 --> 03:16:20.996
LAURA: Oh. Did you have fun?

03:16:20.996 --> 03:16:25.190
LIAM: You seem way more relaxed than even an hour
ago.

03:16:25.190 --> 03:16:26.733
TALIESIN: You smell of pine.

03:16:26.733 --> 03:16:29.503
LAURA: And sap.

03:16:29.503 --> 03:16:33.697
LIAM: Yep. I'll have whatever she's having.

03:16:33.697 --> 03:16:36.717
SAM: Are we ready to do this?

03:16:36.717 --> 03:16:37.825
LAURA: Yeah.

03:16:37.825 --> 03:16:39.053
MARISHA: Sure.

03:16:39.053 --> 03:16:48.552
SAM: Hey, before we go, Lady Kima. (singing) When
the gnome hits your eye like a big pizza pie,

03:16:48.552 --> 03:16:53.407
you've been mind-melded! (speaking) I'm going to
wipe her mind. It's too risky.

03:16:53.407 --> 03:16:55.222
TALIESIN: Of what?

03:16:55.222 --> 03:16:57.267
SAM: Of the whole conversation. It's too risky.

03:16:57.267 --> 03:16:59.897
TALIESIN: That's a lot of mind--

03:16:59.897 --> 03:17:02.338
SAM: Nope! It's a ten-minute conversation.

03:17:02.338 --> 03:17:04.750
LIAM: Ten minutes, when he wants it.

03:17:04.750 --> 03:17:07.185
MATT: All right, what's your spell DC on this?

03:17:07.185 --> 03:17:08.283
SAM: 21.

03:17:08.283 --> 03:17:11.093
MATT: Well, you didn't have your hand cone out,
though, when you did it.

03:17:11.093 --> 03:17:12.889
SAM: Oh, you're going to bust me on that? 19,
then.

03:17:12.889 --> 03:17:14.970
(laughter)

03:17:14.970 --> 03:17:24.946
MATT: Kima's eyes blink for a second.

03:17:24.946 --> 03:17:29.163
"Didn't I warn you, Scanlan Shorthalt, 
not to try and wipe my mind?!"

03:17:29.163 --> 03:17:30.633
SAM: (yelps)

03:17:30.633 --> 03:17:34.456
MATT: She's taking a hit. Natural 20.

03:17:34.456 --> 03:17:36.470
(gasps)

03:17:36.470 --> 03:17:39.272
MATT: Right there. Okay.

03:17:39.272 --> 03:17:45.553
SAM: (nervous laugh) This is how I die.

03:17:45.553 --> 03:17:48.242
TALIESIN: I'm okay with this.

03:17:48.242 --> 03:17:50.681
MARISHA: I &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; feeling relaxed.

03:17:50.681 --> 03:18:06.955
MATT: You take 35 points of damage. 27 of it blunt
damage from the actual impact with the hammer; the

03:18:06.955 --> 03:18:12.264
rest of it's thunder damage. As her Holy Thunder
Maul slams into the side of your head and sends

03:18:12.264 --> 03:18:16.304
you skidding ten feet across the ground, coming to
a halt.

03:18:16.304 --> 03:18:17.936
TALIESIN: That felt fair.

03:18:17.936 --> 03:18:19.605
LAURA: Well, he deserved it.

03:18:19.605 --> 03:18:21.230
MATT: "Damn right, he did."

03:18:21.230 --> 03:18:25.503
LIAM: Well, he had good-- there's a lot at
stake--

03:18:25.503 --> 03:18:28.137
TRAVIS: Vax. Let it be.

03:18:28.137 --> 03:18:32.742
LAURA: How about we get through the tree before we
talk anymore?

03:18:32.742 --> 03:18:36.311
MATT: "I love you guys, but--"

03:18:36.311 --> 03:18:37.704
LAURA: Yeah.

03:18:37.704 --> 03:18:39.436
TALIESIN: Oh, no, he had that coming.

03:18:39.436 --> 03:18:40.787
TRAVIS: It was a good swing.

03:18:40.787 --> 03:18:45.879
MATT: "Thank you. I've been tense recently,
anyway."

03:18:45.879 --> 03:18:50.785
LIAM: I pull the gnome up and cast Lay on Hands
and give him ten hit points. You all right,

03:18:50.785 --> 03:18:51.786
buddy?

03:18:51.786 --> 03:18:58.182
SAM: (groaning) You passed the test. You're worthy
of coming with us on the journey.

03:18:58.182 --> 03:19:02.515
TALIESIN: We can only apologize for him so much.

03:19:02.515 --> 03:19:05.755
MATT: "This is true. Shall we get on with it?"

03:19:05.755 --> 03:19:07.475
TRAVIS and TALIESIN: Yes.

03:19:07.475 --> 03:19:13.160
LAURA: We're popping in far enough away, right? In
the tree grove up above the chasm?

03:19:13.160 --> 03:19:15.148
LIAM: There was that sideways tree?

03:19:15.148 --> 03:19:18.414
MATT: The sideways tree was where you came
through, but you found a tree above that you could

03:19:18.414 --> 03:19:19.395
get to.

03:19:19.395 --> 03:19:22.044
MARISHA: And I grew a tree, right? Didn't I grow
some trees?

03:19:22.044 --> 03:19:23.216
MATT: Yeah.

03:19:23.216 --> 03:19:24.639
MARISHA: I pick one of those trees.

03:19:24.639 --> 03:19:31.887
MATT: Okay. You finish your Transport Via Plants
spell. The portal opens. You all begin darting

03:19:31.887 --> 03:19:34.995
through, Kima darts through. Who's the last one
out?

03:19:34.995 --> 03:19:37.524
TALIESIN: I'll be the last one out.

03:19:37.524 --> 03:19:39.415
MATT: Make a perception check.

03:19:39.415 --> 03:19:48.355
TALIESIN: No. 11.

03:19:48.355 --> 03:19:54.314
MATT: 11. Okay. You dart through the portal before
it closes. You all emerge from the other side. The

03:19:54.314 --> 03:20:00.099
cold, snowy ice hits you. There is actually a bit
of a snowstorm that is blowing through right now

03:20:00.099 --> 03:20:05.663
as you come on the other side. Immediately, the
wind chill hits you, and it gets extremely cold.

03:20:05.663 --> 03:20:14.832
It was darker in the day; it was starting to get
later in the afternoon. Here, it is night. It is

03:20:14.832 --> 03:20:23.122
blustery. Not quite blizzard, but definitely a
heavy snow. Decent wind, night, on the bluff right

03:20:23.122 --> 03:20:30.159
outside the ravine that dips down into the
remnants of Draconia, and the small, icy throne

03:20:30.159 --> 03:20:32.641
that Vorugal currently calls home.

03:20:32.641 --> 03:20:35.493
TALIESIN: Let's find a place to hide the mansion
and sleep.

03:20:35.493 --> 03:20:39.411
MARISHA: What time is it here?

03:20:39.411 --> 03:20:44.020
MATT: It's night. You don't know what hour, but
it's black night.

03:20:44.020 --> 03:20:46.913
MARISHA: I can scry once we get in the mansion.

03:20:46.913 --> 03:20:49.885
LAURA: Can you set us up?

03:20:49.885 --> 03:20:51.933
SAM: Sure, yeah. I'll poof the mansion.

03:20:51.933 --> 03:20:53.245
MATT: Okay.

03:20:53.245 --> 03:20:59.849
LIAM: Also, quickly, I've attuned Whisper, and
I've changed the Deathwalker's Ward to cold.

03:20:59.849 --> 03:21:03.912
LAURA: What's my armor class now that I've put the
cold-snap armor on?

03:21:03.912 --> 03:21:05.349
MATT: You had armor on before, right?

03:21:05.349 --> 03:21:07.417
LAURA: I did, so is it up two points from that?

03:21:07.417 --> 03:21:12.184
MATT: The armor was plus two, right? You have the
item card for it? Then yeah, your armor class

03:21:12.184 --> 03:21:13.536
would be up by two.

03:21:13.536 --> 03:21:25.489
All right, so. You guys enter the mansion. Kima
comes in, looking around. "Well, that's pretty

03:21:25.489 --> 03:21:26.908
"damn swanky!"

03:21:26.908 --> 03:21:29.624
TALIESIN: Yeah. Shut the door.

03:21:29.624 --> 03:21:31.421
MATT: (shushes)

03:21:31.421 --> 03:21:33.271
SAM: I was going to show you to your room--

03:21:33.271 --> 03:21:34.464
MATT: "No."

03:21:34.464 --> 03:21:37.060
SAM: All right, well, then you can sleep in the
fucking living room.

03:21:37.060 --> 03:21:39.748
MATT: "Fine. I've slept in worse."

03:21:39.748 --> 03:21:44.434
SAM: Great. Servants! Don't help her.

03:21:44.434 --> 03:21:54.452
MATT: "I don't need any help." She leans up
against the side of the foyer wall and starts

03:21:54.452 --> 03:21:59.384
taking her armor off. She's keeping an eye on
Scanlan the whole time.

03:21:59.384 --> 03:22:02.157
LAURA: Kima, there's extra rooms upstairs.

03:22:02.157 --> 03:22:03.952
MATT: "I'm good here."

03:22:03.952 --> 03:22:05.990
TRAVIS: Are you hungry at all?

03:22:05.990 --> 03:22:07.990
MATT: "I actually am pretty hungry, yeah."

03:22:07.990 --> 03:22:09.896
TRAVIS: I'll find food for you. I go for the
kitchen.

03:22:09.896 --> 03:22:14.533
MATT: "Thank you." What else do you guys want to
get done in preparation for this?

03:22:14.533 --> 03:22:23.365
LIAM: Do we want to have a Heroes' Feast because
of the terror that dragons inflict upon all those who--

03:22:23.365 --> 03:22:27.285
SAM: Is it prepared?

03:22:27.285 --> 03:22:30.898
LIAM: What else are we saving it for, other than
this?

03:22:30.898 --> 03:22:33.727
SAM: No, I mean, she has to prepare it ahead of
time.

03:22:33.727 --> 03:22:41.220
MARISHA: Can I cast it ahead of time? Sorry. Can I
cast Heroes' Feast at a higher level?

03:22:41.220 --> 03:22:44.242
MATT: You can, yeah. But do you have it prepared?

03:22:44.242 --> 03:22:48.366
MARISHA: No, I brought Transport via Plants. I can
do it in the morning.

03:22:48.366 --> 03:22:52.924
LAURA: But it uses one of your spells? Is that all
right? I mean, it's pretty important.

03:22:52.924 --> 03:22:58.541
MARISHA: It is pretty important. Can I do it as a
ritual spell?

03:22:58.541 --> 03:23:10.330
MATT: I don't think it works that way unless it
says it's a ritual. Sorry. Yeah, Heroes' Feast is

03:23:10.330 --> 03:23:12.734
not a ritual, so you have to have it prepared.

03:23:12.734 --> 03:23:18.155
SAM: You can do it tomorrow morning, or not at
all.

03:23:18.155 --> 03:23:22.940
MARISHA: I'm going to scry.

03:23:22.940 --> 03:23:24.770
MATT: Okay. What are you going to scry?

03:23:24.770 --> 03:23:30.761
MARISHA: I don't want to necessarily scry on
Vorugal, but can I scry in her--

03:23:30.761 --> 03:23:38.280
TALIESIN: She has guards. We also have the leader
of the dragonborn.

03:23:38.280 --> 03:23:42.675
MARISHA: What do you mean?

03:23:42.675 --> 03:23:46.262
TALIESIN: We can see where &lt;i&gt;he&lt;/i&gt; is right now.

03:23:46.262 --> 03:23:49.396
MARISHA: Instead of spying on Vorugal?

03:23:49.396 --> 03:23:53.086
LAURA: Who? What?

03:23:53.086 --> 03:23:58.938
SAM: Wasn't the leader of the dragonborn a female,
first of all? And wasn't Vorugal a male?

03:23:58.938 --> 03:24:00.651
LAURA: She was. Vorugal's a male.

03:24:00.651 --> 03:24:07.253
MATT: Tooma is the leader of the-- They're not
Draconians. These are the Ravenites. Draconians

03:24:07.253 --> 03:24:12.082
were essentially wiped out. Ravenites currently
hold the ravine.

03:24:12.082 --> 03:24:14.356
LAURA: Scry on Tooma.

03:24:14.356 --> 03:24:15.899
MARISHA: I can scry a few times.

03:24:15.899 --> 03:24:20.047
MATT: Just so you're aware, you can only scry on
someone on the same plane of existence, so you'll

03:24:20.047 --> 03:24:22.721
have to step outside the mansion to scry.

03:24:22.721 --> 03:24:26.957
MARISHA: Oh. I'll step outside the mansion to
scry.

03:24:26.957 --> 03:24:28.086
MATT: Okay.

03:24:28.086 --> 03:24:32.475
MARISHA: I step outside the mansion, and I take a
good, hard look around.

03:24:32.475 --> 03:24:34.893
LAURA: I'll sit in the door, and I'll keep an eye
on this.

03:24:34.893 --> 03:24:36.401
MATT: Okay, both you guys make perception checks.

03:24:36.401 --> 03:24:38.502
SAM: I'm also going out there with them.

03:24:38.502 --> 03:24:40.218
TRAVIS: I'm in the kitchen.

03:24:40.218 --> 03:24:41.415
LAURA: Natural 20.

03:24:41.415 --> 03:24:45.958
MARISHA: Hey! 14.

03:24:45.958 --> 03:24:46.992
SAM: Ten.

03:24:46.992 --> 03:24:49.305
MATT: What's the total on that for you, Vex?

03:24:49.305 --> 03:24:54.557
LAURA: 33.

03:24:54.557 --> 03:25:05.634
MATT: Okay. For what distance that you can see,
there is no light visible down in the ravine. It

03:25:05.634 --> 03:25:11.027
is pitch-black darkness. You can see around you,
there are the trees that you guys came through, a

03:25:11.027 --> 03:25:16.146
couple of other barren, broken trees that have
been long dead or at least leafless for a while,

03:25:16.146 --> 03:25:20.844
slowly curling over the edge of the ravine. The
land has eroded over time and they've slowly begun

03:25:20.844 --> 03:25:28.269
to move with it. You don't see anything else in
the immediate vicinity. It is freezing cold,

03:25:28.269 --> 03:25:31.745
though. You're doing okay because of your armor.
You're a little chilly, and you're shaking

03:25:31.745 --> 03:25:37.724
naturally from the wind chill as you're preparing
the ritual. You begin to focus on the scrying. Who

03:25:37.724 --> 03:25:39.817
are you scrying on, currently?

03:25:39.817 --> 03:25:42.021
MARISHA: First, I'm going to scry on Tooma.

03:25:42.021 --> 03:25:52.836
MATT: All right. As the cold begins to hit, the
tips of your fingers begin to go numb, you finish

03:25:52.836 --> 03:25:59.018
the ritual. Your eyes glaze over white, and your
vision projects itself into the darkness in front

03:25:59.018 --> 03:26:04.764
of you. It rushes down like a sudden drop of a
roller coaster into the bottom of the ravine, and

03:26:04.764 --> 03:26:11.299
is rushed to the side, inside the warm interior of
the wall on the western end of the ravine.

03:26:11.299 --> 03:26:16.955
Darting through a number of familiar tunnels, you
find yourself back to the small village that was

03:26:16.955 --> 03:26:25.499
built by the Ravenites, through the central
circular opening where the small fountain was, and

03:26:25.499 --> 03:26:33.304
you're thrust into the tent where you first met
Tooma. There you see upon the throne is Tooma with

03:26:33.304 --> 03:26:41.624
four guards around, currently draped over and
asleep. Slowly snoring as her head droops.

03:26:41.624 --> 03:26:48.509
MARISHA: What's going on around her? Do people
seem to be preparing for a battle?

03:26:48.509 --> 03:26:56.048
MATT: You can't really tell. You only have focus
on her. You see very fuzzy things. There's not a

03:26:56.048 --> 03:26:58.035
lot of action around that you can tell.

03:26:58.035 --> 03:27:01.523
MARISAH: I'm going to do it again.

03:27:01.523 --> 03:27:08.567
MATT: The scry finishes. Your fingers are now
getting more cold.

03:27:08.567 --> 03:27:10.697
MARISHA: I take the cloak and wrap it around as
much as I can.

03:27:10.697 --> 03:27:13.535
MATT: Putting your flame hands to warm yourself up
a bit.

03:27:13.535 --> 03:27:30.014
MARISHA: Now, I'm going to scry on that outside
entrance to Vorugal's lair.

03:27:30.014 --> 03:27:37.254
MATT: Well, Vorugal's lair is in the open of the
ravine. It's a little ways up.

03:27:37.254 --> 03:27:39.288
LARUA: Yeah, remember, it's that raised ice
platform.

03:27:39.288 --> 03:27:43.430
MATT: Where you guys are up on top, it goes down
into the ravine, and the ravine curls through and

03:27:43.430 --> 03:27:48.149
splits off in different directions. In the center
of where a section of the ravine forks off, in the

03:27:48.149 --> 03:27:52.168
center there is that cluster of ice with all the
spikes off it on top of the rubble of one of the

03:27:52.168 --> 03:27:57.665
central islands of Draconia. That's where Vorugal
is currently living.

03:27:57.665 --> 03:28:04.680
MARISHA: Okay, because we were in there earlier,
so can I scry on the location? Not trying to focus

03:28:04.680 --> 03:28:06.183
necessarily on Vorugal?

03:28:06.183 --> 03:28:10.551
TALIESIN: There will be guards at the guard
stations all around the outside.

03:28:10.551 --> 03:28:18.708
MATT: Generally, a particular creature you can
choose from. I can let you scry on the location,

03:28:18.708 --> 03:28:21.796
but I'll have to make you roll for it.

03:28:21.796 --> 03:28:23.619
LAURA: I think that's dangerous.

03:28:23.619 --> 03:28:25.884
MARISHA: Scrying on the dragon, or the location,
or both?

03:28:25.884 --> 03:28:30.420
LAURA: Both. Anything near Vorugal, I feel like
it's dangerous.

03:28:30.420 --> 03:28:33.289
MARISHA: Not knowing could be more dangerous.

03:28:33.289 --> 03:28:40.551
LAURA: Plus, Thordak has those scrying balls
within the location.

03:28:40.551 --> 03:28:58.293
MARISHA: Did Vorugal have any other allies? Do you
remember some of the guards?

03:28:58.293 --> 03:29:03.904
TALIESIN: Just the guards, and it's not really
allies at all. Everybody will turn the moment it looks--

03:29:03.904 --> 03:29:09.153
MARISHA: All right. I abandon the campaign and go
back inside.

03:29:09.153 --> 03:29:16.125
MATT: Okay. Anything else you guys wish to do to
prepare for the evening, before the morning comes?

03:29:16.125 --> 03:29:19.640
SAM: Oh, I'm going to try to load the gun.

03:29:19.640 --> 03:29:28.285
MATT: Okay. Make a dexterity check. Add your
dexterity modifier to a d20 roll.

03:29:28.285 --> 03:29:31.574
SAM: 16.

03:29:31.574 --> 03:29:37.357
MATT: 16. You take a moment and take one of the
pistols. The little barrel clicks out, and you go,

03:29:37.357 --> 03:29:38.461
"Oh!" You take--

03:29:38.461 --> 03:29:41.074
TALIESIN: That's your dex save, not your dex
modifier.

03:29:41.074 --> 03:29:42.937
SAM: Oh! Thank you. 11.

03:29:42.937 --> 03:29:54.865
MATT: 11? You've seen Percy load a bunch, so you
go and take this small bit of powder, put it in,

03:29:54.865 --> 03:30:00.153
put the bullet inside. It slides in, and it seems
fine.

03:30:00.153 --> 03:30:04.434
SAM: Okay. That's it. Holstered.

03:30:04.434 --> 03:30:08.396
MATT: All right. Anything else, guys?

03:30:08.396 --> 03:30:12.667
TALIESIN: I have to sleep it off. I feel terrible,
so I'm just going to sleep.

03:30:12.667 --> 03:30:18.632
MARISHA: Where exactly are we going to-- Do we
have a plan on dropping this beast?

03:30:18.632 --> 03:30:25.794
TALIESIN: We're going to tell Tooma to tell the
dragon that they've found something to kill, and

03:30:25.794 --> 03:30:29.797
take him out into the wastelands where we're going
to release it.

03:30:29.797 --> 03:30:31.616
MARISHA: Should we go try and talk to Tooma now?

03:30:31.616 --> 03:30:35.795
TALIESIN: We could send, I would say, Vax--

03:30:35.795 --> 03:30:39.267
LAURA: I think Scanlan, Polymorphed, something
very teeny.

03:30:39.267 --> 03:30:43.563
SAM: What's going on? Are we going to go talk to
Tooma?

03:30:43.563 --> 03:30:46.266
LAURA: And let her know the plan of releasing--

03:30:46.266 --> 03:30:52.124
TRAVIS: If you leave the safety of the mansion,
you have the chance of being ambushed at any time

03:30:52.124 --> 03:30:53.911
by a fucking dragon.

03:30:53.911 --> 03:30:55.863
SAM: Can we all go as a group tomorrow? No?

03:30:55.863 --> 03:30:59.136
LAURA: No, we can't wander on down into Vorugal's
territory.

03:30:59.136 --> 03:31:00.781
SAM: How far are we from Tooma?

03:31:00.781 --> 03:31:01.972
TALIESIN: Very close.

03:31:01.972 --> 03:31:06.093
LAURA: That's why I said, if you Polymorph into a
teeny, flying bug--

03:31:06.093 --> 03:31:07.542
MARISHA: Fly there. I can Polymorph you.

03:31:07.542 --> 03:31:13.885
LIAM: You can be invisible, as well, and I'm very
sneaky.

03:31:13.885 --> 03:31:15.641
SAM: You could fly.

03:31:15.641 --> 03:31:20.534
LAURA: Dragons see a lot. A lot.

03:31:20.534 --> 03:31:25.689
LIAM: Well, the dragon would know if I was really
a mouse or not, though, as well.

03:31:25.689 --> 03:31:30.750
SAM: We're not going near the dragon. We're going
to see Tooma.

03:31:30.750 --> 03:31:32.886
LAURA: Pretty close to the dragon.

03:31:32.886 --> 03:31:34.965
MARISHA: Yeah, in the same area.

03:31:34.965 --> 03:31:45.529
MATT: Maybe a half- to quarter-mile away from the
entrance to Tooma's area.

03:31:45.529 --> 03:31:47.173
LIAM: Got that Dust of Tracelessness?

03:31:47.173 --> 03:31:54.883
SAM: We could fly in as little birds or something.
Stay low in the ravines, out of sight.

03:31:54.883 --> 03:32:00.299
LIAM: I don't know how to un-Polymorph myself. One
of us has to talk, and you'll do the talking, yeah?

03:32:00.299 --> 03:32:05.724
MARISHA: I can drop Polymorph as long as you guys
keep me in contact with the earpieces.

03:32:05.724 --> 03:32:07.212
SAM: We'll be out of range.

03:32:07.212 --> 03:32:12.614
MARISHA: Then I don't know.

03:32:12.614 --> 03:32:17.904
LIAM: Hit us with the Dust of Tracelessness. You
turn invisible. We'll hoof it.

03:32:17.904 --> 03:32:19.944
SAM: Sure.

03:32:19.944 --> 03:32:21.604
LIAM: Yeah.

03:32:21.604 --> 03:32:22.811
TRAVIS: All of us?

03:32:22.811 --> 03:32:26.374
TALIESIN: No, just them. If they run into a
problem--

03:32:26.374 --> 03:32:29.280
LIAM: We're shit out of luck.

03:32:29.280 --> 03:32:33.243
MARISHA: Are the earpieces going to stay in
range?

03:32:33.243 --> 03:32:36.673
LIAM: Not in a quarter-mile.

03:32:36.673 --> 03:32:39.573
LAURA: Be safe. This is dangerous.

03:32:39.573 --> 03:32:42.243
SAM: All right.

03:32:42.243 --> 03:32:51.120
MATT: They don't work from within the mansion to
outside the mansion. It's a different plane of

03:32:51.120 --> 03:32:52.461
existence, technically.

03:32:52.461 --> 03:33:03.373
MARISHA: Then I'm going to go Minxie form, my
white snow-tiger, and I will stay within earshot

03:33:03.373 --> 03:33:06.131
range so that way if anything goes bad, I can
alert the rest of the group.

03:33:06.131 --> 03:33:10.059
LAURA: How are you going to stay in earshot?

03:33:10.059 --> 03:33:11.971
MARISHA: Earpieces.

03:33:11.971 --> 03:33:14.298
LAURA: Just from the top of the cavern?

03:33:14.298 --> 03:33:17.180
MARISHA: I'll follow as close as I can.

03:33:17.180 --> 03:33:18.642
LIAM: With Dust of Tracelessness.

03:33:18.642 --> 03:33:20.620
TALIESIN: Should be fine.

03:33:20.620 --> 03:33:23.366
LIAM: Hit us, Grog.

03:33:23.366 --> 03:33:26.684
MARISHA: Let's go without having some sort of--

03:33:26.684 --> 03:33:30.591
TRAVIS: You know, the Dust of Tracelessness you
sprinkle behind you.

03:33:30.591 --> 03:33:33.166
MATT: Yeah, it gets rid of tracks. Makes you
harder to track.

03:33:33.166 --> 03:33:36.344
LAURA: I can cast Past Without a Trace on you.

03:33:36.344 --> 03:33:40.944
SAM: I can make us both invisible, so we'll be
plenty stealthy.

03:33:40.944 --> 03:33:45.014
TRAVIS: And real quick, we've got to tell Tooma
that we're coming? You don't think if we start

03:33:45.014 --> 03:33:47.665
attacking her dragon, she'll be like, "Oh! It's
those fucks from two weeks ago!"

03:33:47.665 --> 03:33:49.188
TALIESIN: We're not attacking the dragon.

03:33:49.188 --> 03:33:52.993
LAURA: That's true. If we bust out the thing and
then--

03:33:52.993 --> 03:33:58.668
SAM: No, but they need their people all ready to
attack.

03:33:58.668 --> 03:34:05.280
LIAM: We want them to know to stay clear, to not
attack this thing if they can help it.

03:34:05.280 --> 03:34:09.680
SAM: Also, they might be able to tell us where we
should release the beast.

03:34:09.680 --> 03:34:14.251
MARISHA: Yeah, they would know. They've been
tracking down animals for it to hunt for a while.

03:34:14.251 --> 03:34:15.737
LIAM: It's a worthwhile risk.

03:34:15.737 --> 03:34:18.920
MARISHA: They have to tell him where to find it.

03:34:18.920 --> 03:34:22.962
MATT: You're going there right now?

03:34:22.962 --> 03:34:26.006
LIAM: Yeah, gather up. You, Scanlan, here.

03:34:26.006 --> 03:34:31.369
LAURA: I don't know if Pass Without a Trace works
if I'm not near you.

03:34:31.369 --> 03:34:35.109
MARISHA: I think you have to cast it on yourself.

03:34:35.109 --> 03:34:42.032
SAM: We'll be invisible. It'll be fine. We're the
best in the business. We walked around here

03:34:42.032 --> 03:34:47.250
completely without any stealth protection last
time. We did fine, and we didn't even know

03:34:47.250 --> 03:34:49.265
anything about the culture or the people.

03:34:49.265 --> 03:34:51.510
LAURA: Yeah, but there was no dragon last time.

03:34:51.510 --> 03:34:58.380
MARISHA: I can enhance one of y'all's abilities so
you have advantage on rolls for a stat. I can do

03:34:58.380 --> 03:34:59.811
that to one of you.

03:34:59.811 --> 03:35:02.169
SAM: Maybe you should enhance my stealth ability.

03:35:02.169 --> 03:35:06.189
MARISHA: That's what I was thinking. I'm going to
cast Enhance Ability, and that's a dex ability,

03:35:06.189 --> 03:35:13.256
the Cat's Grace or whatever it was? Cat's Grace on
Scanlan. I'm going to turn into Minxie.

03:35:13.256 --> 03:35:19.684
LIAM: Can I do the same? Does that stuff stack, or
no? I could cast Bless, do the same thing, help

03:35:19.684 --> 03:35:20.784
with saves and--

03:35:20.784 --> 03:35:21.692
MATT: Yeah.

03:35:21.692 --> 03:35:23.059
LIAM: All right, I Bless the three of us.

03:35:23.059 --> 03:35:29.387
SAM: Oh, thanks. I will give us both Invisibility,
level three Invisibility.

03:35:29.387 --> 03:35:36.696
MATT: Okay. Both of you go invisible. You turn
Minxie. What are you doing?

03:35:36.696 --> 03:35:40.310
MARISHA: I'm going to stealth as far behind them
as I can.

03:35:40.310 --> 03:35:43.156
MATT: You guys are all stealthing along the top of
the ravine?

03:35:43.156 --> 03:35:47.270
SAM: Yeah. The top of the ravine? In the ravine,
right?

03:35:47.270 --> 03:35:49.135
MATT: How are you getting down?

03:35:49.135 --> 03:35:50.994
SAM: Oh. Oh, it's steep?

03:35:50.994 --> 03:35:55.098
MATT: It's a cliff. It's the Grand Canyon.

03:35:55.098 --> 03:36:01.144
LIAM: I shoot out the wings, and I glide Scanlan
and I invisibly down to the bottom.

03:36:01.144 --> 03:36:08.975
MATT: Okay. You guys disappear down into the
ravine. You lose eye contact with them once

03:36:08.975 --> 03:36:10.656
they're outside of 120 feet of you.

03:36:10.656 --> 03:36:15.956
MARISHA: I'll stalk the top of the ravine and keep
an ear open.

03:36:15.956 --> 03:36:17.002
MATT: Okay.

03:36:17.002 --> 03:36:22.202
MARISHA: And keep an eye out for anything that
looks horrifying and bad.

03:36:22.202 --> 03:36:24.018
MATT: Okay. Make a--

03:36:24.018 --> 03:36:26.932
SAM: Horrifying check.

03:36:26.932 --> 03:36:28.862
MATT: Make a perception check.

03:36:28.862 --> 03:36:31.532
SAM: Who, us? Her? Everyone?

03:36:31.532 --> 03:36:32.775
MATT: Either of you.

03:36:32.775 --> 03:36:34.054
SAM: 16.

03:36:34.054 --> 03:36:38.541
LIAM: Perception, you said? 22.

03:36:38.541 --> 03:36:48.233
MATT: 22. All right. You glide down, and it takes
you a moment, but you do, over the next 30 minutes

03:36:48.233 --> 03:36:55.299
or so it takes you to finally find the area that's
familiar to you in this dark, that is where you

03:36:55.299 --> 03:37:00.640
guys previously were. You're having to look around
for quite a bit, and it's a lot of having to go

03:37:00.640 --> 03:37:07.687
back up again and glide around. It's a big space,
and in the dark, in the middle of the night, it's

03:37:07.687 --> 03:37:12.536
very difficult for you to figure out any sign of
where you previously tread. You do manage to find

03:37:12.536 --> 03:37:15.098
it, but you're now looking at-- how long does
Invisibility last?

03:37:15.098 --> 03:37:16.377
SAM: One hour.

03:37:16.377 --> 03:37:19.386
MATT: Okay, so you guys are about halfway through
Invisibility's functionality.

03:37:19.386 --> 03:37:21.022
LIAM: And halfway through flying.

03:37:21.022 --> 03:37:27.870
MATT: Marisha, make a survival wilderness check.

03:37:27.870 --> 03:37:31.437
LAURA: I want to sit on the door.

03:37:31.437 --> 03:37:34.250
MATT: A stoop?

03:37:34.250 --> 03:37:40.840
MARISHA: What do I use? Just nature?

03:37:40.840 --> 03:37:42.535
MATT: This is wisdom survival.

03:37:42.535 --> 03:37:43.567
MARISHA: 15.

03:37:43.567 --> 03:37:51.781
MATT: Okay. Best you can, you begin to follow the
edge of the ravine and try and do your best,

03:37:51.781 --> 03:37:58.927
remembering the path of the ravine based on where
you were previously and taking in what sort of

03:37:58.927 --> 03:38:05.440
outcroppings and structures were familiar to you.
You think you may have found, over time, something

03:38:05.440 --> 03:38:09.043
near the entrance. You're not sure. Best you can
do right now.

03:38:09.043 --> 03:38:16.174
You guys eventually find the entrance where you
were led in by the rest of the Ravenites. You zip

03:38:16.174 --> 03:38:26.053
through, and it begins to open up into the
subterranean town, if you will. It is very quiet.

03:38:26.053 --> 03:38:38.088
There are a few walking, appear to be
sentries, haphazardly armed and armored. But it

03:38:38.088 --> 03:38:41.509
seems like the majority of those here are
sleeping.

03:38:41.509 --> 03:38:47.402
LIAM: Whatever we do, we don't want to scare the
shit out of everybody and get attacked.

03:38:47.402 --> 03:38:52.234
SAM: No. Should we become visible, or wait until
we get right up next to Tooma and then become

03:38:52.234 --> 03:38:53.244
visible?

03:38:53.244 --> 03:38:55.202
LIAM: I think we go visible now.

03:38:55.202 --> 03:39:03.755
SAM: All right. Okay, yes, let's do it. I'll drop
Invisibility.

03:39:03.755 --> 03:39:09.996
MATT: Both of you guys appear. Do you begin to
walk toward the central--

03:39:09.996 --> 03:39:12.567
SAM: Yeah, so is anyone awake?

03:39:12.567 --> 03:39:15.262
LIAM: No, we just hear quiet underground.

03:39:15.262 --> 03:39:20.764
MATT: It's a quiet, underground tunnel with a
bunch of huts and tents and small abodes that are

03:39:20.764 --> 03:39:25.819
all silent. There are two wandering sentries that
are armored. As soon as you begin walking through,

03:39:25.819 --> 03:39:27.714
they both turn and look, and see you.

03:39:27.714 --> 03:39:29.586
SAM: Hi. Hello.

03:39:29.586 --> 03:39:31.007
MATT: Spears out.

03:39:31.007 --> 03:39:36.717
SAM: It's fine. Yes, we're friends of Tooma. We've
come to parlay.

03:39:36.717 --> 03:39:38.344
MATT: "Put your weapons down."

03:39:38.344 --> 03:39:41.251
SAM: I have no weapons. I play fiddles.

03:39:41.251 --> 03:39:44.339
MATT: "I see a sword at your side."

03:39:44.339 --> 03:39:46.421
SAM: Would you like me to drop it to the floor?

03:39:46.421 --> 03:39:47.455
MATT: "Yes."

03:39:47.455 --> 03:39:52.055
SAM: All right. Well, I'm already being asked to
take off my belt.

03:39:52.055 --> 03:39:56.304
MATT: "You, too."

03:39:56.304 --> 03:39:57.756
LIAM: All right.

03:39:57.756 --> 03:40:04.838
SAM: We're friends of Tooma. We have an important
mission.

03:40:04.838 --> 03:40:06.939
MATT: Persuasion check.

03:40:06.939 --> 03:40:11.186
SAM: 22.

03:40:11.186 --> 03:40:20.791
MATT: (Draconic words) The other guard walks off.
There's an awkward three-minute beat where he's

03:40:20.791 --> 03:40:27.265
staring at both of you intently, with the spear
out. Eventually the other guard comes back and

03:40:27.265 --> 03:40:32.575
talks back to him in a language you don't
understand. (Draconic words)

03:40:32.575 --> 03:40:34.006
SAM: Oh yeah, we don't speak this.

03:40:34.006 --> 03:40:35.982
LAURA: I should've gone. I really should've gone.

03:40:35.982 --> 03:40:46.269
MATT: "It is a strange hour to drop by, but Tooma
will see you. Leave your weapons where they lay."

03:40:46.269 --> 03:40:51.903
LIAM: You're going to take good care of them?
You're going to leave them there?

03:40:51.903 --> 03:40:53.803
MATT: "They will stay where they lay."

03:40:53.803 --> 03:40:55.353
LIAM: All right.

03:40:55.353 --> 03:41:06.299
MATT: "Come with us." Both of them stand behind
you guys, spears to your back, and nudge you to

03:41:06.299 --> 03:41:12.157
continue forward. You make your way to Tooma's
tent. The four guards inside are there, with their

03:41:12.157 --> 03:41:16.660
spears at the ready. Two of them have shields and
they're-- not an aggressive stance, but definitely

03:41:16.660 --> 03:41:22.275
alert and making sure that you're aware, by their
physicality, that they're paying attention to you

03:41:22.275 --> 03:41:25.403
and are ready to deal with anything you bring.

03:41:25.403 --> 03:41:33.942
Across the way, there's a small fire in the center
of the room, a small fire pit that is largely

03:41:33.942 --> 03:41:40.655
burned out now to small embers. The smell of
smoke and sage is very prominent and strong in the

03:41:40.655 --> 03:41:50.156
room. Tooma, you can see, is now cupping a small
goblet made of simple wood. You see steam rising

03:41:50.156 --> 03:41:52.010
off of it, and she's sipping.

03:41:52.010 --> 03:41:54.274
LIAM: I'll leave this up to you, Mr. Reynolds.

03:41:54.274 --> 03:41:58.179
SAM: Lady Tooma, sorry to wake you out of your
slumber.

03:41:58.179 --> 03:42:00.728
MATT: "It is a very strange hour."

03:42:00.728 --> 03:42:07.953
SAM: Well, where we come from, it's a totally
different time. We've come to complete our promise

03:42:07.953 --> 03:42:16.477
to you. The fact that we are here should give you
at least some confidence that we are men of our words.

03:42:16.477 --> 03:42:18.012
MATT: "Aye, it was close."

03:42:18.012 --> 03:42:23.643
SAM: As a show of good faith, could you please
instruct your guards to go get our weapons and

03:42:23.643 --> 03:42:28.116
bring them close to us? Not for any use, we just
want them close by.

03:42:28.116 --> 03:42:34.698
MATT: "You are not among enemies. Your weapons
will stay where they are while we speak."

03:42:34.698 --> 03:42:40.261
SAM: We really would like them close to us.

03:42:40.261 --> 03:42:42.519
MATT: "Then you should leave."

03:42:42.519 --> 03:42:50.062
SAM: All right. Then we'll leave, and the dragon
will torment your people forever.

03:42:50.062 --> 03:42:52.527
MATT: "That is your choice."

03:42:52.527 --> 03:43:01.759
LIAM: We came with a whole fucking plan. Do you
want to hear about it?

03:43:01.759 --> 03:43:07.055
MATT: "I would love to hear about it, but I do not
talk to people who stumble into my home before the

03:43:07.055 --> 03:43:10.987
"sun rises with weapons and arms at their side."

03:43:10.987 --> 03:43:15.832
SAM: We are not trying to have weapons by our
side, we want them close at hand. I don't trust

03:43:15.832 --> 03:43:18.623
them with people I don't know.

03:43:18.623 --> 03:43:23.577
MATT: "They will not be touched! Everyone is
sleeping, foolish gnome."

03:43:23.577 --> 03:43:27.690
LIAM: We came to report, and we'll get out of
here, all right?

03:43:27.690 --> 03:43:34.045
SAM: Here's the plan. We'll be quick so you can
get back to sleep. Tomorrow morning, we're going

03:43:34.045 --> 03:43:40.390
to release a beast that will, we hope, lure the
dragon out of its lair. We want you and your

03:43:40.390 --> 03:43:43.778
people at the ready to attack. Can that be done?

03:43:43.778 --> 03:43:47.058
MATT: "That can be done, yes."

03:43:47.058 --> 03:43:51.759
SAM: And where would you recommend we release this
beast?

03:43:51.759 --> 03:44:05.804
MATT: Her eyes curl up with a slight, slick sound
of older, not-as-moisturized lizard eyes. You see

03:44:05.804 --> 03:44:23.170
these eyelids click across as she thinks. "Across,
to the northern side of the ravine, the ramp leads

03:44:23.170 --> 03:44:41.331
"up. Up that ramp, you will see a circle of stones,
a hundred feet across. That should suffice."

03:44:41.331 --> 03:44:43.008
SAM: Insight check.

03:44:43.008 --> 03:44:44.248
MATT: Make it.

03:44:44.248 --> 03:44:49.226
SAM: 16.

03:44:49.226 --> 03:44:50.760
MATT: 16?

03:44:50.760 --> 03:44:56.707
SAM: I get a whisper! Who will talk about Loot
Crate?

03:44:56.707 --> 03:45:00.593
LIAM: Man, so many good things about Loot Crate.

03:45:00.593 --> 03:45:09.015
TRAVIS: It's a horror theme this month, you guys.
Friday the 13th. Halloween. Nightmare on Elm

03:45:09.015 --> 03:45:11.965
Street. Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

03:45:11.965 --> 03:45:17.385
TALIESIN: I'm a Halloween fan, myself.

03:45:17.385 --> 03:45:24.437
SAM: Is there any particular time that the dragon
would be hungry for a hunt?

03:45:24.437 --> 03:45:30.227
MATT: "The dragon is always hungry for a hunt.
It's hungry now, I'm sure."

03:45:30.227 --> 03:45:38.462
SAM: And once this hunt happens, and hopefully
weakens the dragon, will you be ready to pounce?

03:45:38.462 --> 03:45:40.827
MATT: "We will be ready."

03:45:40.827 --> 03:45:46.610
SAM: All right. How do we get word to you that
we're in position?

03:45:46.610 --> 03:45:50.619
MATT: "We'll be ready."

03:45:50.619 --> 03:45:54.675
SAM: Okay. Anything else?

03:45:54.675 --> 03:46:06.031
LIAM: The thing we're going to release is gnarly,
so give it a little bit of space.

03:46:06.031 --> 03:46:09.804
MATT: "I will tell my men."

03:46:09.804 --> 03:46:17.624
LIAM: All right, good chat. Scanlan, want to head
back to the pad?

03:46:17.624 --> 03:46:21.420
SAM: Unless you'd like to talk about anything else
tonight?

03:46:21.420 --> 03:46:23.916
MATT: "Please, leave me."

03:46:23.916 --> 03:46:31.103
SAM: Not a morning person? Evening person?

03:46:31.103 --> 03:46:33.536
LIAM: Hey, let's go get our shit and get out of
here.

03:46:33.536 --> 03:46:34.939
SAM: All right.

03:46:34.939 --> 03:46:39.339
LIAM: I grab him by the scruff of the neck and
start pulling him out of the room.

03:46:39.339 --> 03:46:43.169
MATT: You guys leave the tent, make your way back.
Your weapons are right where you dropped them.

03:46:43.169 --> 03:46:51.091
SAM: (hyperventilating)

03:46:51.091 --> 03:46:57.051
LIAM: I'm so sorry, Simon. I should never have
left you in there. Love you.

03:46:57.051 --> 03:47:02.587
MATT: You make your way out toward where the
cavern opens into the ravine itself. The snow is

03:47:02.587 --> 03:47:10.546
still a good foot and a half up now, up the
ravine. What do you guys do?

03:47:10.546 --> 03:47:14.472
LIAM: How long has it been since I bamfed out the
wings? An hour?

03:47:14.472 --> 03:47:18.256
MATT: I'd say it's getting pretty close. You're
not quite sure of the exact time.

03:47:18.256 --> 03:47:21.122
LIAM: Start going up toward the ridge.

03:47:21.122 --> 03:47:23.672
SAM: I hope this doesn't make us fall!

03:47:23.672 --> 03:47:27.395
MATT: All right. You take the wind, the cold wind
hitting the wings. Even though they're an

03:47:27.395 --> 03:47:32.483
extension of the armor, you feel this twinge of
cold hit you. Thankfully you have your resistance

03:47:32.483 --> 03:47:33.957
up, so it's helping with that.

03:47:33.957 --> 03:47:35.731
SAM: One more Invisibility for both of us.

03:47:35.731 --> 03:47:37.462
MATT: All right.

03:47:37.462 --> 03:47:38.948
LAURA: That's &lt;i&gt;important&lt;/i&gt;.

03:47:38.948 --> 03:47:43.039
MATT: Thank you for noting that.

03:47:43.039 --> 03:47:45.309
LIAM: This is intense.

03:47:45.309 --> 03:47:49.288
TRAVIS: (laughing) His hand was like, all right.

03:47:49.288 --> 03:47:54.107
MATT: All right. You guys invisibly coast up
through the ravine.

03:47:54.107 --> 03:48:01.079
TRAVIS: Did you hear the garment of the reaper as
he walked past you?

03:48:01.079 --> 03:48:05.611
(laughter)

03:48:05.611 --> 03:48:08.137
TRAVIS: "Thank you for noting that."

03:48:08.137 --> 03:48:18.337
MATT: Making your way up onto the top of the
cliffside, into a soft bank of snow. Keyleth,

03:48:18.337 --> 03:48:24.342
you do hear the (soft impact) of several footfalls
maybe 40 feet to the left of you. You look over to

03:48:24.342 --> 03:48:26.963
see an indentation in the snow.

03:48:26.963 --> 03:48:30.149
MARISHA: I start pacing that way, assuming it's
them.

03:48:30.149 --> 03:48:35.546
MATT: You guys watch Minxie emerge from the
darkness and snow.

03:48:35.546 --> 03:48:37.965
MARISHA: (meows)

03:48:37.965 --> 03:48:45.123
SAM: Hi, Random Cat Who Is Definitely Supposed To
Be Part of This Landscape. Let's go.

03:48:45.123 --> 03:48:54.262
MARISHA: I got this form from being in the
mountains of my hometown, so yes.

03:48:54.262 --> 03:48:56.271
MATT: You hear, (nonsense meowing).

03:48:56.271 --> 03:48:58.328
(laughter)

03:48:58.328 --> 03:48:59.722
SAM: Can we ride?

03:48:59.722 --> 03:49:01.040
LIAM: Yeah, can we get a lift?

03:49:01.040 --> 03:49:04.622
SAM: I can, probably. I'm little.

03:49:04.622 --> 03:49:06.509
MATT: You both could ride Minxie.

03:49:06.509 --> 03:49:08.069
LIAM: You're massive, aren't you?

03:49:08.069 --> 03:49:10.507
MARISHA: They can ride me? I'm that big?

03:49:10.507 --> 03:49:15.730
MATT: I mean, not full, but they could both be on
your back and you'd be like, (strained noises).

03:49:15.730 --> 03:49:17.233
You could carry them along.

03:49:17.233 --> 03:49:19.837
MARISHA: (strained noises) Back hurts. Come on.

03:49:19.837 --> 03:49:25.657
MATT: You eventually bring them back to the
outside of the door, with Vex waiting for you on

03:49:25.657 --> 03:49:31.898
the stoop. You guys make your way into the warm
interior of Scanlan's mansion, where Kima is

03:49:31.898 --> 03:49:39.105
currently de-armored and snoring, leaning against
the foyer wall. You guys prepare yourselves for an

03:49:39.105 --> 03:49:44.328
evening's rest, for tomorrow, you battle one,
possibly two dragons.

03:49:44.328 --> 03:49:50.229
And that's where we're going to leave the session
for tonight. We'll be back here next week for

03:49:50.229 --> 03:49:52.540
whatever this chaos is going to be.

03:49:52.540 --> 03:49:55.942
SAM: Are you ready to rumble?!

03:49:55.942 --> 03:50:01.501
MATT: We've got Yenk the goristro coming in versus
Vorugal, the Frigid Doom, versus Raishan, the

03:50:01.501 --> 03:50:04.007
Diseased Deceiver.

03:50:04.007 --> 03:50:05.775
LAURA: The Diseased--?

03:50:05.775 --> 03:50:07.469
MATT: The Diseased Deceiver.

03:50:07.469 --> 03:50:12.651
MARISHA: The Diseased Deceiver! Well, I'm going to
write that down.

03:50:12.651 --> 03:50:18.015
TALIESIN: Nothing is going to go wrong. Everything
is great.

03:50:18.015 --> 03:50:23.404
TRAVIS: And we set ourselves up for it.

03:50:23.404 --> 03:50:25.523
SAM: I think we've got a really solid plan.

03:50:25.523 --> 03:50:27.525
LIAM: Two massive enemies.

03:50:27.525 --> 03:50:28.910
TALIESIN: And an army.

03:50:28.910 --> 03:50:34.477
SAM: Also, there's a really good chance that I
won't be able to summon that thing, and then we'll

03:50:34.477 --> 03:50:35.781
have to improvise.

03:50:35.781 --> 03:50:38.054
LAURA: Oh god, I didn't think about that.

03:50:38.054 --> 03:50:48.390
MATT: Don't roll low. Don't roll low, Sam.
&lt;i&gt;Please&lt;/i&gt; don't roll low. That would be so bad.

03:50:48.390 --> 03:50:49.984
SAM: Or so great!

03:50:49.984 --> 03:50:51.709
MATT: Or so great.

03:50:51.709 --> 03:50:54.369
MARISHA: Can I use Enhance Ability to help him out
with his spellcasting?

03:50:54.369 --> 03:50:59.750
SAM: The thing has a DC. A very high DC.

03:50:59.750 --> 03:51:08.048
MATT: You're probably pretty good because you have
a high enough charisma. For you, Enhance Ability,

03:51:08.048 --> 03:51:09.181
let's see.

03:51:09.181 --> 03:51:15.149
LAURA: Can you inspire yourself when you're
casting a spell?

03:51:15.149 --> 03:51:16.546
SAM: I don't know, can I?

03:51:16.546 --> 03:51:23.671
MATT: Let me look at the rules for this. It should
say on the scroll. What do you have to roll?

03:51:23.671 --> 03:51:25.433
SAM: I didn't bring any of my stuff tonight.

03:51:25.433 --> 03:51:31.414
MATT: Actually, Enhance Ability might help with
that. It does give advantage on checks to the

03:51:31.414 --> 03:51:38.080
specific ability, which would be charisma. So it
would be Eagle's Splendor, you would get advantage

03:51:38.080 --> 03:51:39.342
on charisma checks.

03:51:39.342 --> 03:51:40.465
SAM: Eagle's Splendor?

03:51:40.465 --> 03:51:46.499
MARISHA: Yeah, they've got fancy names for each
one, like Cat's Grace, Eagle's Splendor.

03:51:46.499 --> 03:51:52.999
MATT: So in theory, that could help. We'll define
it more. I'll look at the scroll I wrote up, look

03:51:52.999 --> 03:51:57.660
at the rule, make sure we confirm that before next
episode, but yes. That is probably a possibility.

03:51:57.660 --> 03:52:02.578
And if this is an ability check, you could also
inspire yourself with a d12.

03:52:02.578 --> 03:52:05.014
MARISHA: Honey badger Spock, is that what you just
said?

03:52:05.014 --> 03:52:12.153
MATT: Anyway, start thinking how you're going to
handle this next week, guys. You've got a week to

03:52:12.153 --> 03:52:13.829
pull this together.

03:52:13.829 --> 03:52:17.952
MARISHA: Yeah, we can talk this time!

03:52:17.952 --> 03:52:19.562
LIAM: Sure. We're in the mansion.

03:52:19.562 --> 03:52:23.944
MATT: Yeah, you guys are having a whole night
where you can work this out.

03:52:23.944 --> 03:52:28.060
TALIESIN: Yeah, and I'm annoyed that I know what
that perception check was about, and that Percy

03:52:28.060 --> 03:52:30.118
doesn't know. It really annoys me.

03:52:30.118 --> 03:52:31.119
MATT: You don't know.

03:52:31.119 --> 03:52:32.105
TALIESIN: Yeah, I do.

03:52:32.105 --> 03:52:36.894
MATT: Anyway, guys, well done. Great game tonight.
Thank you guys for watching. We'll be back here

03:52:36.894 --> 03:52:40.727
next week, on Thursday. Is it Thursday yet?

03:52:40.727 --> 03:59:33.104
[music]
