00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.669
MATT: Hello, and welcome this evening to Critical
Role, everyone. A show where a bunch of us

00:00:03.705 --> 00:00:09.600
nerdy-ass voice actors play Dungeons and Dragons
and have a good time. Guess we can go ahead and--

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:13.590
we forgot to do the format this time and start
with the intro. We trying to do that going forward

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.113
because it makes more sense. But for now, let's go
ahead and jump to the intro and we'll be right

00:00:17.113 --> 00:00:20.276
back to describe what we have going on.

00:00:20.276 --> 00:01:27.176
[dramatic music]

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.787
MATT: Welcome back. So first and foremost, we got
a couple quick announcements to get into for this

00:01:31.787 --> 00:01:36.926
week. For every 100 subs we get to the channel
this evening we'll be doing giveaways. The

00:01:36.926 --> 00:01:42.397
giveaways this week will include a signed photo of
the cast of Critical Role, as well as, for the

00:01:42.397 --> 00:01:48.409
first time offering, a large print poster of one
of the classic moments within our campaign drawn

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:53.002
by our illustrious Kit Buss, our official artist
for Critical Role. I think Zac should be showing

00:01:53.002 --> 00:01:55.865
you that photo that we'll be giving away, a really
nice, high-quality print of that signed by the

00:01:55.865 --> 00:02:03.515
cast. And we'll send that out to whoever wins the
wonderful prize for the chat room. I think we're

00:02:03.515 --> 00:02:09.019
50 away from our first giveaway. So, you got to
get that climbing so we can give that out shortly.

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:15.172
Also, as we've previously, the past two weeks, had
some great guests joining our first half of the

00:02:15.172 --> 00:02:19.713
Vox Machina group on their adventure, this week we
have two new guests joining us for this and next

00:02:19.713 --> 00:02:24.251
week. If I can have a big, warm welcome to our
players this week: Wil Wheaton and Will Friedle.

00:02:24.251 --> 00:02:29.084
Thank you guys so much for joining us. Excited to
have you.

00:02:29.084 --> 00:02:30.274
MARISHA: So awesome.

00:02:30.274 --> 00:02:31.588
WILL: Slightly nervous.

00:02:31.588 --> 00:02:36.670
WIL: You're going to be great, don't worry about
it. I want to apologize in advance to Liam for

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.903
having to share a table with me. I'm sorry for
what's going to happen to your dice on account of

00:02:40.903 --> 00:02:47.767
how close we are to each other. I hope you're not
too attached to anything

00:02:47.767 --> 00:02:49.589
with your character at all.

00:02:49.589 --> 00:02:51.356
(laughter)

00:02:51.356 --> 00:02:56.413
WIL: I know. I'm just telling you, if there's dice
you really love, you might want to put them away.

00:02:56.413 --> 00:02:59.165
LIAM: I'll just kiester this one.

00:02:59.165 --> 00:03:05.047
MATT: That's the most comfortable way to do that.
Well, awesome guys. Thank you so much for joining

00:03:05.087 --> 00:03:10.432
us in this. Before we jump in, let's see if we
have any announcements that anyone wants to make,

00:03:10.432 --> 00:03:16.394
anything coming up, anything you want to talk
about. I'll start. I'll say that as of flying out

00:03:16.394 --> 00:03:20.058
this evening, I should say, I have a flight at
12:15 from LAX. I'll be flying out to Columbus,

00:03:20.058 --> 00:03:24.847
Ohio for Matsuricon this weekend. So, any of you
guys out there in the Ohio area want to come and

00:03:24.847 --> 00:03:29.333
visit me for the weekend, I'll be doing signings,
panels, and general hanging out with fans and

00:03:29.333 --> 00:03:34.555
stuff. So if you're in the vicinity, come say hi.
That's my announcement. Anyone else have anything

00:03:34.555 --> 00:03:35.668
they want to mention?

00:03:35.668 --> 00:03:41.188
ORION: Yeah. I recently started my own Twitch
stream. So you can follow me and watch. I play a

00:03:41.188 --> 00:03:47.265
lot of video games, guys. It's horrible addiction
that's amazing. But it's @orionacaba on Twitch.

00:03:47.265 --> 00:03:50.951
MATT: You keep streaming Thursdays at 7:00, which
I think is really counterproductive.

00:03:50.951 --> 00:03:52.591
ORION: It's weird.

00:03:52.591 --> 00:03:57.888
WIL: When you've mastered being in two places at
once, it's silly not to take advantage of it.

00:03:57.888 --> 00:04:04.283
ORION: I am actually hosting Geek and Sundry on my
channel right now.

00:04:04.283 --> 00:04:05.633
MATT: Oh, look at you.

00:04:05.633 --> 00:04:08.601
LIAM: Are you simultaneously brewing at home right
now?

00:04:08.601 --> 00:04:12.669
WIL: I am. And I am also running this game in
an alternate universe.

00:04:12.669 --> 00:04:14.813
LIAM: Oh. Wow.

00:04:14.937 --> 00:04:24.049
WIL: It's pretty great. Yeah. And Matt rolls so
bad in that game. It's really great. I am having

00:04:24.156 --> 00:04:29.285
dinner with my wife tomorrow so I'm looking
forward to that. We're probably going to put a

00:04:29.285 --> 00:04:35.617
whole chicken in the smoker in the afternoon and
then I think we're going to play some games. I'm

00:04:35.617 --> 00:04:38.461
introducing her to a game that I got at Gen Con
called Lanterns.

00:04:38.461 --> 00:04:39.763
MARISHA: Lanterns?

00:04:39.763 --> 00:04:42.039
WIL: Yeah, really fun Dom Lux game. Really like it
a lot.

00:04:42.039 --> 00:04:43.808
MARISHA: We'll have to check that out.

00:04:43.808 --> 00:04:48.043
WILL: I, after four lovely years, popped the
question last week.

00:04:48.043 --> 00:04:49.615
MATT: Yes, you did.

00:04:49.615 --> 00:04:51.407
WILL: And I am engaged to be married. Yes.

00:04:51.407 --> 00:04:53.263
(cheering)

00:04:53.263 --> 00:04:54.907
WILL: Thank you very much.

00:04:54.907 --> 00:04:58.495
MATT: I would say Susan's a very lucky girl, but
really, it's the other way around.

00:04:58.495 --> 00:05:01.140
WILL: No, I'm the lucky one. I lucked out. I
really was the one who lucked out.

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:03.268
LIAM: Does she know or is this the proposal?

00:05:03.307 --> 00:05:08.092
WILL: I was going to propose like this, but we
live in the woods and we don't get this show

00:05:08.092 --> 00:05:13.653
there. We have no internet whatsoever. No, she
knows. She knows. She stupidly said yes, so we'll

00:05:13.653 --> 00:05:15.426
see what happens next.

00:05:15.426 --> 00:05:19.812
WIL: If you need an entree into the Society of Men
Who Married Way Above Their Stations, I can

00:05:19.812 --> 00:05:21.225
provide you an introduction.

00:05:21.225 --> 00:05:28.137
WILL: Thank you. (laughs) That's awesome. Yes,
that is absolutely what happened here, so I will

00:05:28.137 --> 00:05:28.938
need that.

00:05:28.938 --> 00:05:30.959
WIL: Yeah, they're members-only jackets.

00:05:30.959 --> 00:05:32.374
MARISHA: Members-only jackets.

00:05:32.374 --> 00:05:39.239
WIL: The sleeves are little too short on all of
the jackets, so we remember.

00:05:39.239 --> 00:05:40.849
WILL: That's perfect. I like that.

00:05:40.849 --> 00:05:42.415
MATT: A lot of suede.

00:05:42.415 --> 00:05:44.034
WILL and WIL: Yeah.

00:05:44.034 --> 00:05:45.689
(laughter)

00:05:45.689 --> 00:05:48.990
WIL: And a nylon hood zipped into the neck, for
some reason.

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:51.906
MATT: Which no one ever uses, and you forget it's
there until you're like, "What's that? Oh, right."

00:05:51.906 --> 00:05:53.446
Congratulations.

00:05:53.446 --> 00:05:56.336
WILL: Thank you. You are the first to know that
that's happened.

00:05:56.336 --> 00:06:02.999
MATT: There you go. Exclusive. Critical Role
exclusive. Well, fantastic. Let's go ahead and

00:06:02.999 --> 00:06:05.352
jump into where we left off.

00:06:05.352 --> 00:06:09.135
WIL: I thought I just heard you say you need a
pencil.

00:06:09.135 --> 00:06:10.373
ORION: Yeah, I do.

00:06:10.373 --> 00:06:14.078
WILL: That's what happens when you're in multiple
places at once. The realities start blending.

00:06:14.078 --> 00:06:15.797
WILL: I'll share, if you'd like.

00:06:15.797 --> 00:06:17.215
ORION: Thank you.

00:06:17.215 --> 00:06:19.640
MATT: Anyone else need a pencil? Everyone good?

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:21.229
WILL: That was a good throw and catch.

00:06:21.229 --> 00:06:23.478
WIL: I have a mechanical pencil that looks like a
pencil pencil.

00:06:23.478 --> 00:06:28.314
WILL: I think I have the same kind of pencil.

00:06:28.314 --> 00:06:29.792
WIL: Yeah, it's nice.

00:06:29.792 --> 00:06:31.897
MARISHA: We do the hand-eye coordination thing.

00:06:31.897 --> 00:06:38.716
MATT: All righty, guys. As it currently stands,
Vox Machina throughout its ventures found itself

00:06:38.716 --> 00:06:45.119
in the city of Vasselheim, as of late. They came
to seal away the Horn of Orcus they had tore from

00:06:45.119 --> 00:06:49.345
the head of the beholder K'Varn deep in the
Underdark. Once they had completed this journey,

00:06:49.345 --> 00:06:56.460
they spent some time in the city trying to figure
out what can be done there, preparation for

00:06:56.460 --> 00:07:04.498
possibly Keyleth making a venture out to one of her
Ashari tribes. During which, Grog entered a fight

00:07:04.498 --> 00:07:07.977
ring and lost. And the party decided to go ahead
and--

00:07:07.977 --> 00:07:09.427
MARISHA: Never forget.

00:07:09.427 --> 00:07:13.747
MATT: I have a feeling Kern and Grog are going to
have a round two in the near future, depending on

00:07:13.747 --> 00:07:18.612
how Grog's feeling about that. Then the party saw
that there was some sort of hydra-like being that had

00:07:18.612 --> 00:07:23.063
been harrying the walls of the outskirts of the
city of Vasselheim. Being the adventurers they

00:07:23.063 --> 00:07:27.227
are, they took it upon themselves to leap out into
the jungles and the forests of the Vesper

00:07:27.227 --> 00:07:34.797
Timberland. Found and hunted down this hydra,
fought it, and upon slaying it, discovered there

00:07:34.797 --> 00:07:39.067
was another group also hunting this hydra. An
actually sanctioned group. And that hunting this

00:07:39.136 --> 00:07:41.847
hydra is considered illegal in 
Vasselheim unless you had actually been contracted to

00:07:41.887 --> 00:07:47.885
do so. So in breaking the laws of Vasselheim, they
could have been tried for it, but instead chose to

00:07:47.885 --> 00:07:53.470
return to the city with this group of hunters and
be brought before their guildmaster, the

00:07:53.470 --> 00:07:59.454
Huntmaster known as Huntmaster Vanessa Cyndrial.
Basically, they were given the choice: they could

00:07:59.454 --> 00:08:04.409
go to trial or they could undergo their own
personal trial to join the guild, the Slayer's

00:08:04.409 --> 00:08:10.163
Take, which is essentially a guild that takes on
contracts to hunt various requested creatures

00:08:10.163 --> 00:08:16.206
down, harvest elements of their physical bodies to
then be sold or returned to these individuals and

00:08:16.206 --> 00:08:21.120
be paid for it. If they manage to complete these
trials, they will be absolved of breaking the law

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:25.172
because they will now be within the confines of it
and will be members of the guild. So choosing

00:08:25.172 --> 00:08:30.045
that, they were then also notified that they would
be splitting up into two different groups, much to

00:08:30.045 --> 00:08:32.481
the chagrin of Vex and Vax, our twins.

00:08:32.481 --> 00:08:36.070
WILL: Split apart.

00:08:36.070 --> 00:08:38.550
LIAM: Separation anxiety is a real thing.

00:08:38.550 --> 00:08:48.795
MATT: So this group, the second adventuring group,
has gathered itself back to the Bellows' Respite

00:08:48.795 --> 00:08:56.517
inn. Vax, you were asked to go the bar, to join
your sister, Vex, for a shot of the hardest liquor

00:08:56.517 --> 00:09:01.652
they had available to deal with the coming
separation. You shared a brief breakfast, shared

00:09:01.652 --> 00:09:09.394
your bitter, spiteful, alcoholic imbibement, and
then went your separate ways. The first group went

00:09:09.394 --> 00:09:14.719
initially, and it's been about an hour or so of
you guys waiting in the tavern for them to, as far

00:09:14.719 --> 00:09:17.919
as you know, take care of their business before you
were to go to the guild yourselves. So, we have

00:09:17.919 --> 00:09:24.974
Tiberius, Keyleth, and Vax all sitting around the
Bellows' Respite tavern lamenting what's going to

00:09:24.974 --> 00:09:26.458
come next.

00:09:26.458 --> 00:09:33.499
ORION: Oh, cheer up, Vax. She'll be back soon.
I've never seen you quite so down.

00:09:33.499 --> 00:09:38.088
MARISHA: I've been separated from my parents for a
really long time. You get used to it.

00:09:38.088 --> 00:09:39.458
It's not too bad.

00:09:39.458 --> 00:09:45.527
LIAM: It took you years to do that. I'm two
minutes in, so I'll grieve a little bit longer.

00:09:45.527 --> 00:09:49.633
MARISHA: Don't say the word grieve. That's
strong.

00:09:49.633 --> 00:09:55.159
ORION: Yes, it's implying that someone has died.
And no one has. So, you know.

00:09:55.159 --> 00:09:58.459
MARISHA: It's only a few days. It'll be good.
Separation makes the heart grow fonder and all

00:09:58.459 --> 00:09:59.427
that stuff.

00:09:59.427 --> 00:10:03.032
LIAM: It's fine. I just have a low tolerance for
bullshit, and I'd like to get past this little

00:10:03.032 --> 00:10:07.507
piece of shit that we're being made to swallow.

00:10:07.507 --> 00:10:16.152
ORION: I agree. Stormwinds should not be meddling
around with these peasants. Are we in a tavern?

00:10:16.152 --> 00:10:18.501
MATT: You are currently in the Bellows' Respite
Tavern.

00:10:18.501 --> 00:10:25.028
ORION: Barkeep, bring me your finest ale for my
friend here and for the lady. I'll take a water.

00:10:25.028 --> 00:10:32.066
MATT: The relatively jovial, ginger-bearded,
rotund human gentleman who runs the establishment

00:10:32.066 --> 00:10:36.368
comes over to you. Looks like himself is a little
bleary-eyed and hasn't quite adjusted to the

00:10:36.368 --> 00:10:42.213
morning light itself. "Oh okay. Certainly, I'll go
ahead and retrieve that for you. It's three? Three

00:10:42.262 --> 00:10:43.643
"is what I'm looking at?"

00:10:43.643 --> 00:10:44.913
MARISHA: What time is it?

00:10:44.913 --> 00:10:47.922
MATT: Right now, I'd say it's roughly 9:00 to
10:00 in the morning.

00:10:47.922 --> 00:10:53.011
MARISHA: Oh sure. Let's start early. Why not?

00:10:53.011 --> 00:10:57.810
ORION: And I flip him a couple of gold coins.

00:10:57.810 --> 00:11:00.459
MATT: He tries to catch it, fumbles. Goes and pick
it up.

00:11:00.459 --> 00:11:02.785
MARISHA: Don't throw. That's rude.

00:11:02.785 --> 00:11:11.859
MATT: Five minutes go by. Your food and drink are
brought to your table, and you continue to lament

00:11:11.859 --> 00:11:17.821
about the coming time. Is there anything else you
guys wish to take care of before you make

00:11:17.821 --> 00:11:19.892
your way to the Slayer's Take Guildhall?

00:11:19.892 --> 00:11:26.153
MARISHA: Well, since we're getting separated, Grog
is taking the Bag of Holding.

00:11:26.153 --> 00:11:28.469
ORION: I have one; don't forget that.

00:11:28.469 --> 00:11:33.022
MARISHA: Right, but we had a lot of stuff in that
Bag of Holding. I kept most of the stuff that I

00:11:33.022 --> 00:11:37.150
needed on me, but how many healing potions do we
have?

00:11:37.150 --> 00:11:41.258
LIAM: Not a lot. That's what I'm concerned about.
We lost our meat shield and we don't have Pike. So

00:11:41.258 --> 00:11:45.703
I think we probably need to go and get some
potions.

00:11:45.703 --> 00:11:51.106
MARISHA: I can go ahead and brush up on healing
spells, as well. Make sure I come a little bit

00:11:51.106 --> 00:11:53.357
more well-equipped, just in case.

00:11:53.357 --> 00:11:57.164
ORION: I'm good on potions, but we should restock
our supply.

00:11:57.164 --> 00:11:58.644
LIAM: How many have you got?

00:11:58.644 --> 00:12:04.056
ORION: I have, let me see here, three potions of
greater healing, and three

00:12:04.056 --> 00:12:05.740
regular potions of healing.

00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:07.026
LIAM: Can I have one?

00:12:07.026 --> 00:12:10.618
ORION: I suppose. If we're just going to buy more,
it doesn't matter. But just in case something

00:12:10.618 --> 00:12:11.893
happens along the way.

00:12:11.893 --> 00:12:13.259
LIAM: Thank you.

00:12:13.259 --> 00:12:15.546
MARISHA: I only have one greater healing potion
right now.

00:12:15.546 --> 00:12:20.558
ORION: Yes, so we'll go buy more. And then we'll
see what else they have. I would like to see if we

00:12:20.558 --> 00:12:26.722
can procure a couple of items, like a couple of
empty vials. I've used a lot of mine. Maybe find

00:12:26.722 --> 00:12:31.102
some acid or whatnot at these item shops. So let's
look around and get the stuff.

00:12:31.102 --> 00:12:32.120
MARISHA: Okay.

00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:35.312
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and make an investigation
check.

00:12:35.312 --> 00:12:39.353
MARISHA: Apparently we have the flying carpet?

00:12:39.353 --> 00:12:41.996
LIAM: Do we have the flying carpet?

00:12:41.996 --> 00:12:49.152
MATT: The flying carpet is, for the most part,
kept wrapped up in Grog's Bag of Holding.

00:12:49.152 --> 00:12:57.263
MARISHA: Because I think Grog was checking out.
He's breaking up a little bit. But I feel like he

00:12:57.263 --> 00:12:59.927
just told me that we took the flying carpet.

00:12:59.927 --> 00:13:03.142
LIAM: (imitating Grog) We took the flying carpet.
Sorry.

00:13:03.142 --> 00:13:08.448
MARISHA: He's very far away, but I feel it's
reaching its limits.

00:13:08.448 --> 00:13:12.020
LIAM: (imitating Grog) I would like to bogart the
flying carpet and everything in the fucking Bag.

00:13:12.020 --> 00:13:15.191
MARISHA: He apparently left us with the flying
carpet?

00:13:15.191 --> 00:13:21.877
ORION: He's saying he left with the flying carpet,
Keyleth. He left with it. We don't have it.

00:13:21.877 --> 00:13:27.806
MARISHA: He said, remember, you took the flying
carpet. To break RP for a second.

00:13:27.806 --> 00:13:29.883
LIAM: (imitating Grog) Am I texting you that right
now?

00:13:29.883 --> 00:13:34.677
MARISHA: Yeah. I can't. You're cutting out. You're
cutting out, Grog.

00:13:34.677 --> 00:13:40.378
ORION: I held it for a time, but I only have my
Wheel of Mending in mine, as far as I know. Hold

00:13:40.378 --> 00:13:42.249
on, let me check.

00:13:42.249 --> 00:13:45.311
MATT: As you reach into your Bag of Holding--

00:13:45.311 --> 00:13:47.200
ORION: I'm thinking really hard.

00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:53.535
MATT: Through the luck of the draw, it seems to be
that the last resting place of the flying carpet

00:13:53.575 --> 00:13:55.072
was within your Bag of Holding.

00:13:55.183 --> 00:13:57.299
ORION: Hold on. Oh here it is.

00:13:57.299 --> 00:14:03.076
MARISHA: Oh, look at that. We have it.

00:14:03.076 --> 00:14:05.146
ORION: Shut my mouth. I guess I was wrong.

00:14:05.146 --> 00:14:06.428
MARISHA: Found it. We're good.

00:14:06.428 --> 00:14:10.067
LIAM: All right, let's go to the store. I don't
really want to drag this out any longer than we

00:14:10.067 --> 00:14:12.266
have to. And I walk out the door and start going.

00:14:12.266 --> 00:14:14.524
MATT: Okay. What did you roll for your
investigation check, Tiberius?

00:14:14.524 --> 00:14:15.444
ORION: 16.

00:14:15.444 --> 00:14:21.074
MATT: 16? Okay. As you guys take the next 20
minutes wandering the Quad Roads district of

00:14:21.074 --> 00:14:27.182
Vasselheim, asking around. A lot of the shops here
offer general supplies. There are a few that are

00:14:27.182 --> 00:14:31.637
focused on the mining supplies as there is a large
market mining cobalt out of the center of the

00:14:31.637 --> 00:14:38.264
mountain the city is built around. You find places
that provide clockwork for large grandfather

00:14:38.264 --> 00:14:44.243
clocks that are starting to be distributed in this part of
the city. You also find that there is a large

00:14:44.286 --> 00:14:49.931
bazaar-type market in the center of the Quad Roads
that you passed by when you first came to town.

00:14:49.931 --> 00:14:57.469
Amongst many of these barkers, you do catch one
small tent, Tiberius, that catches your eye

00:14:57.469 --> 00:15:04.315
because it resembles the same purple color as one
tent you guys entered in Emon about a year or so

00:15:04.315 --> 00:15:07.251
ago, in which you encountered a fortune teller.

00:15:07.251 --> 00:15:15.666
MARISHA: Oh shit! It's the Witch's Fortune. What
are you looking for?

00:15:15.666 --> 00:15:18.504
LIAM: Look at those fingers fly.

00:15:18.504 --> 00:15:20.809
ORION: I approach.

00:15:20.809 --> 00:15:28.169
MARISHA: Do you know her name? Remember her name?
I can probably find it. It would take a minute of

00:15:28.169 --> 00:15:39.005
digging, through. Hang on. I've got to go back to my
old notes. I've got to go back to my old D&amp;D

00:15:39.056 --> 00:15:42.092
notes. Keep doing stuff.

00:15:42.092 --> 00:15:46.847
MATT: So as you enter the tent, you pull the
curtains apart. There is one other individual who

00:15:46.847 --> 00:15:51.491
seems to be just perusing the interior. But the
smell that hits you immediately is very heavy

00:15:51.491 --> 00:16:00.556
sage, ceremonial burning of various spices, giving
the area a mystical scent. The light itself is

00:16:00.556 --> 00:16:04.950
very low, just a few flickering candles and a
hooded lantern in the far corner directed outward

00:16:04.950 --> 00:16:12.215
give a bit of ambiance to the interior of the
tent. The series of small ropes and cords made of

00:16:12.215 --> 00:16:25.650
hemp and silk carry trinkets and bones and various
enchanted accoutrements. And in the far back

00:16:25.650 --> 00:16:31.582
corner, amongst the table there is indeed a very
beautiful elven woman dressed in a fine silk gown

00:16:31.582 --> 00:16:37.623
with a metallic headband, her dirty blonde hair
behind her ears. And she looks to be in the middle

00:16:37.623 --> 00:16:43.755
of shuffling a deck of tarot cards. As you enter,
she looks up and gives you a look of surprise and

00:16:43.755 --> 00:16:46.277
then a curious look of remembrance.

00:16:46.277 --> 00:16:47.448
MARISHA: Am I with him?

00:16:47.448 --> 00:16:50.348
MATT: You're behind him and outside of the tent.
He entered. Did you guys want to go in with him?

00:16:50.348 --> 00:16:51.491
LIAM and MARISHA: Yes.

00:16:51.491 --> 00:16:55.317
MATT: All right, you enter and are greeted by this
same atmosphere.

00:16:55.317 --> 00:16:59.458
MARISHA: (gasps) Trista!

00:16:59.458 --> 00:17:02.142
MATT: She gives you a cross look.

00:17:02.142 --> 00:17:08.182
MARISHA: It's been so long! Fancy meeting you
here.

00:17:08.182 --> 00:17:13.869
MATT: She puts her finger up for a second, turns
over to the noblewoman who is currently perusing

00:17:13.869 --> 00:17:19.322
this small shelf of books and tomes. "I'm terribly
sorry. Would you mind just giving us a moment?

00:17:19.322 --> 00:17:22.057
"I've some personal business to attend to."

00:17:22.057 --> 00:17:26.412
The noble woman is like, "Oh, fine. I didn't want
to purchase anything anyway." And stomps out of

00:17:26.412 --> 00:17:29.418
the tent. The door closes behind her.

00:17:29.418 --> 00:17:34.220
At which point the elven woman immediately turns.
"Trista's my sister."

00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:36.905
MARISHA: You're Forsythia?

00:17:36.905 --> 00:17:43.076
MATT: "It's good to see you again, young
half-elf." You can see now with the current

00:17:43.076 --> 00:17:49.192
atmosphere, the light seems to dim the interior of
the tent. And the elven woman's visage shimmers

00:17:49.192 --> 00:17:54.804
and then fades and there sitting behind the table
you see a large, hunched forward, gnarled

00:17:54.804 --> 00:18:02.550
humanoid. This woman, who is definitively referred
to as a hag, is currently

00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:07.626
lording over the table, long, twisted fingers
holding that same deck of cards. Looking up at you

00:18:07.626 --> 00:18:14.390
with a crooked nose and pointed chin. There's a
grin on her face. And looks to you and, "It has

00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:23.334
"been some time, dragonborn. I can still see there
is a fraction of you still missing."

00:18:23.334 --> 00:18:30.155
ORION: Yes. I still don't know what that means.
But I am actually happy to see you, milady.

00:18:30.155 --> 00:18:36.570
MATT: Still shuffling her cards. "So was there
anything I can help you with?"

00:18:36.611 --> 00:18:45.796
ORION: Yes. Yes, there is. You mentioned before,
when I asked you last, of the Boros Ring. You

00:18:45.796 --> 00:18:56.998
revealed that it was in the Fey, the Wild Fen. I
am also in search of the item that I did not get

00:18:56.998 --> 00:19:03.739
to ask you about called the Pale Stone. I wish to
know the location of that, as well.

00:19:03.739 --> 00:19:19.219
MATT: She gives you a keen look. "I think for the
time being, one quest is enough. Return when you've

00:19:19.219 --> 00:19:27.678
"procured this ring you so graciously seek, then
perhaps the rest of this will be revealed. Grow

00:19:27.678 --> 00:19:37.068
"greedy with fate and I fear the timeline will
swallow you up, young dragonblood." She pulls the

00:19:37.068 --> 00:19:40.440
cards down and just starts going over her own
reading. Each card she slams down with a heavy

00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:50.589
thud. The room seems to almost cloud, the air
growing thicker. And there's a hint of frustration

00:19:50.638 --> 00:19:56.231
that she's currently being bothered and strung
out. After she takes a few moments to herself, she

00:19:56.231 --> 00:20:02.404
looks back you. "Is there business you seek, aside
from asking me these questions? Perhaps a bauble

00:20:02.404 --> 00:20:05.836
"or two. I make fine baubles."

00:20:05.836 --> 00:20:09.550
ORION: Since you're not in the business of
information, then we are in the business of

00:20:09.550 --> 00:20:17.794
procuring some specific items. Potions. I'm
looking for a few empty glass vials. Perhaps some

00:20:17.794 --> 00:20:19.186
acid, if you have it.

00:20:19.186 --> 00:20:24.226
MATT: She stands up. And as she stands up, you can
now see the hag, which hunched forward, sits at a

00:20:24.226 --> 00:20:29.403
solid five feet tall. At full height, even with
the hunch, she's now cresting the top of the tent

00:20:29.403 --> 00:20:37.755
at seven feet. Long, stringy, gray-black hair
framing the shoulders. The same nice goldish silk

00:20:37.755 --> 00:20:45.652
outfit the elf appearance was wearing is there. It
looks much more world-tattered and matches the one

00:20:45.652 --> 00:20:49.370
currently wearing it. She reaches behind her,
still staring you intently in the face, and grabs

00:20:49.370 --> 00:20:55.670
a small case off the wall. Sets it down before
her. Pulls back the wooden lid and inside, you can

00:20:55.670 --> 00:21:06.255
see there are three small glass vials. "These are
what I have to offer. Two of them will right your

00:21:06.255 --> 00:21:13.577
"physical form, perhaps take care of some of those
wounds someone as foolish and careless as you

00:21:13.577 --> 00:21:26.838
"eventually deal with. The third one is caustic in its
nature. Its application is up to you. They are

00:21:26.838 --> 00:21:34.706
"sold as a set, though. 300 gold pieces. Take it or
leave."

00:21:34.706 --> 00:21:44.152
ORION: You don't have to be all nasty about it. I
have the money. Here you go.

00:21:44.152 --> 00:21:50.225
MATT: She reaches over and as you hold the small
bag of coin out, her hand completely engulfs

00:21:50.225 --> 00:21:54.185
yours. The fingers wrap around, and for a second
you feel a tug. And you are awkwardly pulled

00:21:54.185 --> 00:21:58.835
forward a few inches. You get closer to her face.
The breath catches your nostrils, the scent of

00:21:58.835 --> 00:22:05.853
swamp water and old fish. It's a moment of
intensity where you forget your surroundings for a

00:22:05.853 --> 00:22:11.059
brief moment. And it's just you and this entity.
And you realize, she's far older than you ever

00:22:11.059 --> 00:22:17.531
gave her credit for. She pulls the bag of coin
from your hand and withdraws. The light seems to

00:22:17.531 --> 00:22:24.490
return from the peripheral of your vision. Keyleth
and Vax are there at your side. She reaches

00:22:24.490 --> 00:22:32.329
forward and pushes the box forward toward you on
the table. "Be safe, and may fortune smile upon

00:22:32.329 --> 00:22:33.954
"most of you."

00:22:33.954 --> 00:22:43.986
ORION: Yes, I know something bad is going to
happen. I show them the box. I take it and pick it

00:22:43.986 --> 00:22:49.920
up. This is all she had to offer. She's not taking
questions.

00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:52.461
MARISHA: You're not taking any questions right
now?

00:22:52.461 --> 00:22:53.942
MATT: "Not today."

00:22:53.942 --> 00:22:55.626
MARISHA: Not today?

00:22:55.626 --> 00:23:02.748
MATT: "As you know, my dealings with fate take a
lot out of me. I'm not quite ready for another

00:23:02.748 --> 00:23:10.377
"round of tellings. You see, this city, as most
bits of civilization, are very eager to hear what

00:23:10.377 --> 00:23:15.723
"the future has in store for them. So I'm a bit
tapped out at the moment." And you can see a

00:23:15.723 --> 00:23:19.815
bit of dried blood around one of her nostrils. And
if you recall last time, the process was very

00:23:19.851 --> 00:23:28.878
physically taxing on her. "Perhaps return in a
week or so. And if I'm not here, I'm around."

00:23:28.918 --> 00:23:35.822
LIAM: Old one, are you still willing to trade
today?

00:23:35.822 --> 00:23:40.195
MATT: "Trade?"

00:23:40.195 --> 00:23:48.327
LIAM: I'm wondering if you have any poisons beyond
the run-of-the-mill nightshades

00:23:48.327 --> 00:23:52.261
this afternoon or morning?

00:23:52.261 --> 00:24:02.863
MATT: She stands up and reaches over, and there's
a small alchemical glassware set up on the side.

00:24:02.863 --> 00:24:10.587
And you see it's cracked and old and it's been
brutalized. And she pulls a very small vial of

00:24:10.587 --> 00:24:21.854
some dark, black, almost umbra-type liquid where
you can't even see shine in the light. It absorbs all

00:24:21.896 --> 00:24:30.946
the light. She puts it forward. "This would be
very unfortunate to find its way into the

00:24:30.946 --> 00:24:33.432
"bloodstream of an enemy, yes?"

00:24:33.432 --> 00:24:36.354
LIAM: What do you want for it?

00:24:36.354 --> 00:24:47.078
MATT: "A favor. Not now, but perhaps down the
road."

00:24:47.078 --> 00:24:49.233
ORION: She does that, Vax. A lot.

00:24:49.233 --> 00:24:52.591
LIAM: Why not?

00:24:52.591 --> 00:24:59.828
MATT: She pushes it forward with her long, crooked
fingernail, shoves the vial forward. It screeches

00:24:59.828 --> 00:25:06.317
across the top of the table. She withdraws her
hand. "So it is done." At that moment, there's a

00:25:06.317 --> 00:25:13.598
very a cold shiver down the back of your neck that
then fades. She just grins with this nasty, toothy

00:25:13.598 --> 00:25:20.957
grin. "Now, be on your way. I have cards to
shuffle."

00:25:20.957 --> 00:25:23.290
LIAM: Yoink.

00:25:23.290 --> 00:25:32.195
MARISHA: It was so nice to see a familiar face in
such a strange place. She's lovely.

00:25:32.195 --> 00:25:34.752
ORION: Yes. Good day, madam.

00:25:34.752 --> 00:25:41.616
MATT: As you step out, she raises her hand in
front of her and her form once again shimmers and

00:25:41.616 --> 00:25:46.673
shifts down to that beautiful elven maiden that
greeted you as you entered. The lights tend to

00:25:46.673 --> 00:25:49.592
blossom a little bit and you close the tent behind
you.

00:25:49.592 --> 00:25:54.685
LIAM: As we're leaving, I say, that's a good look.

00:25:54.685 --> 00:26:02.427
MATT: Gives a slight breathy chuckle that starts
beautiful. (chuckle turns into a cackle)

00:26:02.464 --> 00:26:06.021
ORION: What did we actually get?

00:26:06.021 --> 00:26:16.924
MATT: You acquired two potions of greater healing,
and a vial of caustic liquid. You are uncertain as

00:26:16.924 --> 00:26:18.451
to what its properties are.

00:26:18.451 --> 00:26:20.078
MARISHA: Caustic liquid.

00:26:20.078 --> 00:26:29.586
MATT: You also don't quite know the properties of
yours, but you gather, the assurance from a

00:26:29.586 --> 00:26:33.758
creature of this power, that she speaks in
riddles, but not in untruths.

00:26:33.758 --> 00:26:39.136
ORION: I'm going to give you another one of the
greater potions. So mark that down.

00:26:39.136 --> 00:26:44.296
LIAM: Thank you. We're right in the middle of the
bazaar. Do we want to take a quick jog around? I

00:26:44.296 --> 00:26:47.583
grab someone passing by and say, you, potions?
Where? Here?

00:26:47.583 --> 00:26:51.924
MATT: The person looks down at your arm, brushes
it off, and the middle-aged gentleman goes,

00:26:51.924 --> 00:26:58.757
"Sir, you do realize that most of the potion
trade is controlled by the clergy?"

00:26:58.810 --> 00:27:01.250
MARISHA: They're all like no magic and stuff
here.

00:27:01.250 --> 00:27:05.069
LIAM: I did not know that. Thank you. Well, shit.

00:27:05.069 --> 00:27:07.811
MARISHA: Wait. Did he say that it was controlled
by the clergy?

00:27:07.811 --> 00:27:09.546
ORION: So we should go there.

00:27:09.546 --> 00:27:16.925
MARISHA: Hang on. Just because it is controlled by
the clergy doesn't mean that it's legal. Doesn't

00:27:16.925 --> 00:27:21.322
mean that if we go knocking on their door
requesting potions that they're going to take

00:27:21.354 --> 00:27:25.698
kindly to that. Kind of like getting your
concealed deadly

00:27:25.698 --> 00:27:29.062
weapons license in certain places.

00:27:29.062 --> 00:27:33.382
LIAM: I grab another weirdo passing by and say,
excuse me. There's probably a temple around here.

00:27:33.382 --> 00:27:36.566
Can you point us in the right direction?

00:27:36.566 --> 00:27:42.186
MATT: The individual looks at you awkwardly and
points over. And you can see just past the

00:27:42.186 --> 00:27:46.752
outskirts of this bazaar, there are a number of
buildings that line the outer area of this central

00:27:46.752 --> 00:27:53.791
portion. You can see where he is pointing, there
is a large cathedral made of almost, from this

00:27:53.791 --> 00:28:00.689
distance, a warbling, warped obsidian, and it is
far more ominous and obelisk-like in appearance

00:28:00.689 --> 00:28:05.421
than the other temples. In a district of the city
that you haven't been to yet. But it is the

00:28:05.421 --> 00:28:07.092
closest temple.

00:28:07.092 --> 00:28:11.744
WIL: Warbling Obsidian is my Black Crowes cover
band.

00:28:11.744 --> 00:28:17.743
LIAM: I'm getting itchy. Can we just go to the
Take please?

00:28:17.743 --> 00:28:25.075
MARISHA: I turn and I lean into Tiberius and I
say, he's going to be cranky the entire time

00:28:25.075 --> 00:28:26.742
we're on this field trip, isn't he?

00:28:26.742 --> 00:28:28.270
ORION: Yes, and usually I'm the cranky one.

00:28:28.309 --> 00:28:29.543
MARISHA: I know.

00:28:29.543 --> 00:28:32.195
ORION: So let's head to the temple. Right? Yes?

00:28:32.195 --> 00:28:33.885
MARISHA: I guess.

00:28:33.885 --> 00:28:35.803
ORION: Can you turn into a horse?

00:28:35.803 --> 00:28:40.823
MARISHA: Yes, but that's a little forward, don't
you think?

00:28:40.823 --> 00:28:42.241
ORION: I'm just asking.

00:28:42.241 --> 00:28:44.817
LIAM: Are we going to the temple or the Take?

00:28:44.817 --> 00:28:47.601
ORION: Oh, the Take? What would make you feel
better?

00:28:47.601 --> 00:28:51.271
LIAM: Let's get on with it, shall we? Jesus, 
whoever that is.

00:28:51.271 --> 00:28:57.613
ORION: That was that one carpenter we met in in
Vasselheim.

00:28:57.667 --> 00:29:00.891
LIAM: Oh, he was sweet. He had some good herb.

00:29:00.891 --> 00:29:06.134
ORION: Yes, he did. He sure knew how to-- it was
dank.

00:29:06.134 --> 00:29:15.397
MATT: "Dank," which is arcane terms for
"thaumaturgical." Anyway. You make your way to the

00:29:15.397 --> 00:29:22.552
southern outskirts of this portion of the bazaar,
which leads its way into the central building

00:29:22.552 --> 00:29:27.766
cluster portion of the Quad Roads district to the
outside of the Slayer's Take Guildhall. You walk

00:29:27.766 --> 00:29:33.280
up to the main doorway which has the inscription
in front. And pushing the door open, you enter

00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:42.571
into the main foyer area, where you see the same
cast-iron chandeliers hanging from the ceiling,

00:29:42.571 --> 00:29:49.057
the dark wood rafters frame the entire internal
area. And there sitting at the central desk is

00:29:49.057 --> 00:29:58.052
Mertin, the scarred-up halfling with the
relatively joyful disposition. He looks up from

00:29:58.052 --> 00:30:05.175
his books. "Okay, it appears to me that we have
the other half of this adventuring group to deal

00:30:05.175 --> 00:30:09.513
"with. Let us hope that perhaps you have better
luck than your previous friends in what has been

00:30:09.513 --> 00:30:11.143
"chosen for you, eh?"

00:30:11.143 --> 00:30:12.693
LIAM: They already headed out?

00:30:12.693 --> 00:30:16.366
MATT: "Yes, they left not more than an hour ago, I
imagine."

00:30:16.366 --> 00:30:19.806
MARISHA: And what were they contracted with?

00:30:19.806 --> 00:30:22.547
MATT: "Oh, nothing. They're going to kill a
dragon. Would you like

00:30:22.547 --> 00:30:23.923
"me to go get the mistress for you?"

00:30:23.923 --> 00:30:24.855
LIAM: Excuse me?

00:30:24.855 --> 00:30:27.591
MATT: "I'll take that as a yes. I'll be right
back."

00:30:27.591 --> 00:30:29.942
And he gets up from his table and wanders off.

00:30:29.942 --> 00:30:38.259
ORION: They'll be fine. I'm sure of it. Scanlan
makes good decisions all the time.

00:30:38.291 --> 00:30:48.412
MATT: As you wait a few moments, eventually
Mertin returns. But he seems, his head down, a

00:30:48.412 --> 00:30:52.004
little humbly, and gestures out with his hands.
And you hear the familiar footsteps of the

00:30:52.004 --> 00:31:00.610
Huntmaster, Vanessa Cyndrial. Her tiefling
appearance both very striking in her chiseled bone

00:31:00.610 --> 00:31:06.121
structure in her face, her dark leather armor
itself creaking slightly with each footstep. And

00:31:06.121 --> 00:31:09.772
she has that very commanding yet welcoming
appearance, which you know hides a very

00:31:09.772 --> 00:31:20.333
hard-to-read interior. She steps forward. "Well,
are you ready to take on the other half of this

00:31:20.333 --> 00:31:27.811
"mission? Your friends were eager. And they
traveled with some of our finer warriors. Are you

00:31:27.811 --> 00:31:29.892
"confident in your capabilities today?"

00:31:29.892 --> 00:31:34.787
ORION: Listen, don't be smug with me. None of us
what to be here or cooperate with this stupid

00:31:34.833 --> 00:31:37.557
event just to abide your laws.

00:31:37.557 --> 00:31:39.556
MARISHA: Tiberius, we could be on trial.

00:31:39.556 --> 00:31:42.149
ORION: The answer is yes. Let's get on with it.

00:31:42.149 --> 00:31:49.235
MATT: "You see, it is very simple. I like it,
direct and to the point. I respect that."

00:31:49.235 --> 00:31:51.571
ORION: Oh. Well, thank you.

00:31:51.571 --> 00:31:57.743
MATT: "The angry, flowery part in the middle, not so
much a fan of. All right. So," she reaches behind

00:31:57.779 --> 00:32:04.262
and pulls out what looks like a small, rolled-up
piece of parchment. Looks at it for a second.

00:32:04.262 --> 00:32:10.698
"Well, you have one other hopeful for this guild
that will be joining you for this, and a leader

00:32:10.698 --> 00:32:15.636
"will be assigned to you on this excursion to keep an eye
on you and make sure you stay within the rules and

00:32:15.676 --> 00:32:18.478
"not go absconding to some other country and we
have to hunt you down."

00:32:18.478 --> 00:32:19.859
LIAM: Fantastic.

00:32:19.859 --> 00:32:21.440
ORION: Can we use the word liaison?

00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:27.984
MATT: "A liaison, if you will. Mertin, would you
get the other hopeful for this?"

00:32:27.984 --> 00:32:33.172
Mertin says, "Of course, my lady." He gets up, and
walks over, and knocks on a door. As you hear the

00:32:33.218 --> 00:32:39.392
door knock on the opposite side of the room, opens
it up. And the red, tousled hair, halfling.

00:32:39.392 --> 00:32:44.015
"Kashaw, your group has arrived."

00:32:44.015 --> 00:32:50.704
WILL: Well, it's about time. I'm sick of waiting.
(sighs) He walks out and meets everybody.

00:32:50.704 --> 00:32:56.421
MATT: As you guys look, the door opens, and a
human male steps out into the light. If you wish to

00:32:56.421 --> 00:32:58.404
describe yourself.

00:32:58.404 --> 00:33:07.689
WILL: I am Kashaw Vesh, an acolyte. Here I am,
waiting for you for so long now. Do I have to

00:33:07.689 --> 00:33:09.750
travel with them the entire time?

00:33:09.750 --> 00:33:13.596
MATT: "For the remainder of this contract at
least. But once you have joined the Guild, perhaps

00:33:13.596 --> 00:33:15.121
"other groups will be assigned to you."

00:33:15.121 --> 00:33:20.190
MARISHA: I'm sorry. I'm sorry, were we late? We
didn't mean to keep you waiting. Or do you mean

00:33:20.190 --> 00:33:28.830
like, you've been waiting for us for a long time
in the destiny, "we're here and where have you

00:33:28.830 --> 00:33:31.293
been my whole life" kind of way?

00:33:31.293 --> 00:33:33.351
WILL: Is she always like this?

00:33:33.351 --> 00:33:35.421
ORION: Yes, she is.

00:33:35.421 --> 00:33:37.544
LIAM: Not good at reading emotions.

00:33:37.544 --> 00:33:40.182
WILL: This is going to be fun. Yes. No, I meant
you're late.

00:33:40.182 --> 00:33:42.925
MARISHA: Wait. Is that what people say about me?

00:33:42.925 --> 00:33:44.880
LIAM: I don't.

00:33:44.880 --> 00:33:46.447
MARISHA: We'll talk later.

00:33:46.447 --> 00:33:47.528
WILL: Who are you?

00:33:47.528 --> 00:33:49.345
LIAM: Vax'ildan.

00:33:49.345 --> 00:33:51.855
ORION: I am Tiberius Stormwind.

00:33:51.855 --> 00:33:53.449
WILL: A dragonborn.

00:33:53.449 --> 00:33:56.885
LIAM: What's your thing? What do you do?

00:33:56.885 --> 00:34:01.681
WILL: What I do is not really important. What I
want to get done, I think, is what matters. What I

00:34:01.681 --> 00:34:04.814
want to do is start this quest. Is that what you
called it? Quest?

00:34:04.814 --> 00:34:05.960
MATT: "It is a contract."

00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:09.449
WILL: A contract, a job. Can we just get out
there, please, and do what we have to do?

00:34:09.449 --> 00:34:10.682
MATT: "Very well."

00:34:10.682 --> 00:34:13.995
LIAM: I agree. Let's hurry it up, Merkin. Shall
we?

00:34:13.995 --> 00:34:16.454
WILL: That wasn't your name, was it?

00:34:16.454 --> 00:34:20.563
MATT: "It's Mertin. Mertin is the name. But it's
okay."

00:34:20.563 --> 00:34:24.875
LIAM: I'm not from these parts. It's my accent.
Sorry.

00:34:24.875 --> 00:34:36.089
MATT: "I can hear accent from upbringing. It's
Syngornian use. It's fine. Mertin. Never mind." By

00:34:36.089 --> 00:34:40.313
the way, the human that has walked out, you can
see has shoulder-length brown hair, a leather

00:34:40.313 --> 00:34:46.930
cord that is tied around the center of the
forehead. Eyes two different colors. One I believe

00:34:46.930 --> 00:34:48.258
is a light blue?

00:34:48.258 --> 00:34:53.389
WILL: It's a light blue. One is a bright yellow.
And his right arm, all the way up from where you

00:34:53.389 --> 00:34:56.576
can see where it disappears below the armor is
covered in one-inch cuts,

00:34:56.576 --> 00:35:00.516
with scars all the way up.

00:35:00.516 --> 00:35:02.375
ORION: Ah, a religious man.

00:35:02.375 --> 00:35:03.811
WILL: Maybe.

00:35:03.811 --> 00:35:11.119
MATT: Mertin goes over and knocks on a door, opens
it up. This individual is easy to hear from a

00:35:11.119 --> 00:35:16.256
distance. The heavy footfalls and the grumbling
echoes through the hallways before he even

00:35:16.256 --> 00:35:21.516
appears. Mertin leads you into the light of the
main foyer area. "This will be the group of which

00:35:21.516 --> 00:35:25.481
"you will be guiding on this. I appreciate you
doing this for us. I know it's not really usually

00:35:25.481 --> 00:35:30.299
"what you do. But here is your team for this
contract."

00:35:30.299 --> 00:35:36.626
WIL: I'm sorry, where is the team?

00:35:36.626 --> 00:35:38.058
MATT: "This is your team."

00:35:38.058 --> 00:35:42.981
And Vanessa chuckles to herself. "I'm sorry. This
is what you'll be dealing with today."

00:35:42.981 --> 00:35:45.312
MARISHA: Hi.

00:35:45.312 --> 00:35:48.749
ORION: Hello, I'm Tiberius Stormwind.

00:35:48.749 --> 00:35:51.518
MATT: "Now Thorbir, play nice."

00:35:51.518 --> 00:35:54.821
MARISHA: What was that?

00:35:54.821 --> 00:35:58.382
MATT: "Thorbir. Thorbir, play nice."

00:35:58.382 --> 00:36:10.804
WIL: So he's a dwarf. He's a really stout dwarf.
He's got really a long, red beard that's singed off

00:36:10.804 --> 00:36:22.901
in the lower right corner. The bottom of the top
part of his beard is braided and clamped off with

00:36:22.901 --> 00:36:29.571
all these ornate things. He's got these big,
thick, ropey, white braids that come down on

00:36:29.571 --> 00:36:37.602
either side of his face and frame his face. And
these have these really big Dwarven runes on them.

00:36:37.602 --> 00:36:39.505
Do any of you speak Dwarven?

00:36:39.505 --> 00:36:40.454
ORION: Yes.

00:36:40.454 --> 00:36:41.441
MARISHA: No.

00:36:41.441 --> 00:36:42.355
WILL: Yes.

00:36:42.355 --> 00:36:50.296
WIL: All right, so for those of you who speak
Dwarven, this is a really offensive curse word in

00:36:50.296 --> 00:36:56.990
Dwarven. And this one is an even more offensive
curse word in Dwarven. You don't say these in

00:36:56.990 --> 00:37:03.513
friendly company. He's got a scar that
runs down across his face. And the eye that it

00:37:03.568 --> 00:37:12.604
runs through is black. And his other eye is blue.
And you can see that he's got Dwarven script

00:37:12.604 --> 00:37:19.205
written in tattoos all the way down his right
arm.

00:37:19.248 --> 00:37:24.818
MATT: "So please, if you would not mind making
sure that they see their contract to fruition,

00:37:24.818 --> 00:37:30.306
"taking them on this as you will, showing them the
ropes of the guild, and try not get them killed."

00:37:30.306 --> 00:37:32.498
WIL: And for me?

00:37:32.498 --> 00:37:37.603
MATT: "Well, you will be rewarded as per the
contract. You will have done the guild a great

00:37:37.603 --> 00:37:40.477
"favor, which you know favors can go a very long
way in the guild."

00:37:40.477 --> 00:37:45.794
WIL: I certainly do. You don't have to tell me
about repaying favors.

00:37:45.794 --> 00:37:53.514
MATT: "Fair enough. Well, perhaps now would be a
good time for this jovial lot of adventurers to

00:37:53.514 --> 00:37:56.369
"know what it is they are to hunt down."

00:37:56.369 --> 00:37:58.948
WIL: Is it an actual group?

00:37:58.948 --> 00:38:04.760
MATT: "Well, we'll see how well you can make it
into one. Perhaps this is a test for you as well,

00:38:04.760 --> 00:38:06.183
"fair dwarf."

00:38:06.183 --> 00:38:09.253
MARISHA: I think is going to be an excellent
bonding experience.

00:38:09.253 --> 00:38:10.815
WILL: Seriously, the whole time she is like this?

00:38:10.815 --> 00:38:13.316
ORION: Yes, she is. It grows on you, though.

00:38:13.316 --> 00:38:15.186
WILL: I'm sure it does.

00:38:15.186 --> 00:38:16.352
So does the plague.

00:38:16.352 --> 00:38:18.960
MARISHA: Everyone has such a problem with
optimism.

00:38:19.013 --> 00:38:27.409
MATT: She unravels it. Looks at it. "I think this
will do well for what is required. We will bind

00:38:27.409 --> 00:38:32.889
"this contract to you now. Feel free to take over.
If you wouldn't mind reading, half-elf."

00:38:32.889 --> 00:38:45.358
MARISHA: You know, public speaking is not really
my strong suit. Okay. Ordered and paid in advance

00:38:45.358 --> 00:38:47.635
by anonymous.

00:38:47.635 --> 00:38:50.838
ORION: Oh, they're a fun group.

00:38:50.838 --> 00:38:55.689
MARISHA: This contract, binding in honor and the
elements, sets upon the agreed members of the

00:38:55.734 --> 00:39:00.816
Slayer's Take Guildhall, and the task of locating
and slaying the below-mentioned entity, and the

00:39:00.816 --> 00:39:10.123
recovery of the below-listed harvested anatomy
items. And any anatomy items not recovered or not

00:39:10.123 --> 00:39:15.980
in functional condition will be deducted from the
final payment and refunded to the client. Oh. This

00:39:15.980 --> 00:39:21.333
contract is good for three days and should the
contract not be fulfilled within that time period,

00:39:21.333 --> 00:39:26.272
all payments are null and void, this contract is
null and void, and membership of the Slayer's Take

00:39:26.272 --> 00:39:30.765
is revoked-- outside of the Huntmaster's willful
forgiveness.

00:39:30.765 --> 00:39:32.910
LIAM: Skip to the punchline.

00:39:32.910 --> 00:39:41.901
MARISHA: The quarry has been approved for hunting
by the Holy Paramours of the Crown of Erathis. The

00:39:41.901 --> 00:39:50.374
quarry of one rakshasa. What's a rakshasa?

00:39:50.374 --> 00:39:51.770
LIAM: Tiger man.

00:39:51.770 --> 00:39:53.326
MARISHA: Tiger man?

00:39:53.326 --> 00:39:55.179
LIAM: Essentially.

00:39:55.179 --> 00:39:56.650
WILL: How do you know that?

00:39:56.650 --> 00:39:59.915
LIAM: Storybooks in Syngorn.

00:39:59.915 --> 00:40:10.159
MARISHA: We need two rakshasa eyes, one rakshasa
tongue, one rakshasa heart, two rakshasa claws,

00:40:10.159 --> 00:40:14.544
and two rakshasa canine teeth. So canine.

00:40:14.544 --> 00:40:17.062
ORION: Would this be an arcana or this be a
history check?

00:40:17.062 --> 00:40:19.182
MATT: This would be more of an arcana check.

00:40:19.182 --> 00:40:21.150
ORION: I'm going to do an arcana check. 18.

00:40:21.150 --> 00:40:29.975
MATT: 18? Rakshasas were entities that originally
stemmed from the realm of the Nine Hells. They are

00:40:29.975 --> 00:40:41.318
devils. They are deceptive, and usually embed
themselves in elements of society where they can

00:40:41.318 --> 00:40:50.294
grasp and take power. They love having servitude
beneath them, and they are notoriously difficult

00:40:50.294 --> 00:40:59.314
and slippery to find, let alone nail down and
destroy. Appearance-wise, they look like a normal

00:40:59.314 --> 00:41:07.655
humanoid man, but have the face of a tiger, and
the other curious element is both of their hands

00:41:07.655 --> 00:41:15.076
are reversed. That's as much as you can glean from
your formal training and understanding.

00:41:15.076 --> 00:41:18.083
LIAM: Does this cat have a name?

00:41:18.083 --> 00:41:22.353
MATT: "Why does it matter? All we know is we can
confirm that there is one within the vicinity,

00:41:22.353 --> 00:41:27.005
"or huntable at the very least. The rest is
up to you to find."

00:41:27.005 --> 00:41:33.436
MARISHA: The quarry is where it's been last
located? Oh, okay. Yeah, you double-check it. I

00:41:33.436 --> 00:41:35.272
might have missed something.

00:41:35.272 --> 00:41:37.182
WILL: Why can't we know who the client is?

00:41:37.182 --> 00:41:40.967
MATT: "The client has decided they wish to remain
anonymous for this contract."

00:41:40.967 --> 00:41:44.434
ORION: This seems to be bothering you, Kashaw.

00:41:44.434 --> 00:41:48.098
WILL: Everything's been bothering me lately. She's
not helping. Do you want to read this?

00:41:48.098 --> 00:41:55.498
ORION: It's going to say the same thing. Which
part?

00:41:55.498 --> 00:42:00.912
WILL: Give me this. How far to the quarry?

00:42:00.912 --> 00:42:05.198
MATT: "Your quarry is the creature."

00:42:05.198 --> 00:42:09.123
WILL: You said it was in the vicinity. What are we
talking "in the vicinity?" Are we talking a day's

00:42:09.123 --> 00:42:10.936
hike? We talking an hour from here?

00:42:10.936 --> 00:42:14.379
MATT: "Meaning, we've been able to confirm that
there is one that is within a huntable distance

00:42:14.379 --> 00:42:19.865
"within the three days of the contract. However,
part of this trial is to see just how good you are

00:42:19.865 --> 00:42:25.876
"at finding and destroying such creatures, so that
information is for you to find, unless you do not

00:42:25.876 --> 00:42:29.347
"feel your skills are up to par for the Slayer's
Take, in which case, you are more than welcome to

00:42:29.347 --> 00:42:32.226
"go for the door, human."

00:42:32.226 --> 00:42:37.645
LIAM: And you have no further information? Are
there any grumpkins you want us to find? Do you

00:42:37.645 --> 00:42:42.670
expect us to go out with no information at all to
find a man with a tiger's head?

00:42:42.670 --> 00:42:48.416
MATT: "Well, you seem like a well-traveled unit.
You seem to have done well enough to find and

00:42:48.416 --> 00:42:53.417
"destroy great things you spoke of as you walked
into these halls. Prove to me that you are more

00:42:53.417 --> 00:42:58.234
"than just sell-swords. Show to me that you have
the intellect, that you have the skill sets, that

00:42:58.234 --> 00:43:03.669
"you have the cleverness to find the creature that
does not wish to be found."

00:43:03.669 --> 00:43:06.374
LIAM: Is this how things normally go around here?

00:43:06.374 --> 00:43:11.848
WIL: Normally, I don't waste my time with the
likes of you. Man with a tiger's head is going to

00:43:11.848 --> 00:43:18.541
stand out. No problem finding him. Let's stand
here and talk about this forever, or let's head

00:43:18.585 --> 00:43:20.975
out and get this over with.

00:43:20.975 --> 00:43:27.800
ORION: Well, dwarf, why don't you do your title and
lead then? And I should warn you, you are walking

00:43:27.800 --> 00:43:35.823
with a Stormwind. You may not know my name, but I
can assure you, I alone am an army, so we are well

00:43:35.863 --> 00:43:39.328
protected. So, lead us to find this tiger-man,
please.

00:43:39.328 --> 00:43:41.577
WIL: Dragonborn is a lot of talk.

00:43:41.577 --> 00:43:45.866
WILL: If he's an army, why not just send him out?

00:43:45.866 --> 00:43:50.084
MARISHA: That was probably the ballsiest thing
you've ever said.

00:43:50.084 --> 00:43:54.822
WIL: All right, Storm?

00:43:54.822 --> 00:43:59.476
ORION: Wind. People call me Tibsy.

00:43:59.476 --> 00:44:04.402
WIL: Let's see how good you are at following. And
he heads out.

00:44:04.402 --> 00:44:07.268
LIAM: He's not very good. Oh, he's gone.

00:44:07.268 --> 00:44:11.749
MATT: As the dwarf exits, and you guys follow.
Outside of the Slayer's Take into the center of

00:44:11.749 --> 00:44:20.314
the main Quad Roads thoroughfare, on the outskirts
of the bazaar to seek a rakshasa, wherever one may

00:44:20.314 --> 00:44:22.624
be found.

00:44:22.624 --> 00:44:25.866
MARISHA: I thought this was going to be a fun
field trip.

00:44:25.866 --> 00:44:28.876
ORION: Well, I mean "rakshasa" does sound fun.
Rakshasa!

00:44:28.876 --> 00:44:33.888
MARISHA: It does. It is a tiger person, so maybe
we can relate.

00:44:33.888 --> 00:44:36.070
WILL: I want to switch teams.

00:44:36.070 --> 00:44:40.007
ORION: No, it gets better.

00:44:40.007 --> 00:44:45.768
LIAM: What's your name again? I'm sorry.

00:44:45.768 --> 00:44:49.042
WILL: I am Kashaw Vesh. Call me Brother Kash.
Everyone else does.

00:44:49.042 --> 00:44:52.336
LIAM: Kash. Brother Kash, are you new to the
Guild, as well?

00:44:52.336 --> 00:44:56.926
WILL: I'm not a member of the Guild yet. I had
something happen with someone who did something

00:44:56.966 --> 00:44:59.803
and now I'm here. Why don't we leave it at that,
for now?

00:44:59.803 --> 00:45:01.309
LIAM: That's how we got here.

00:45:01.309 --> 00:45:04.277
WILL: Apparently, I only have to be here for
another three days, which will be good.

00:45:04.277 --> 00:45:05.992
LIAM: All right.

00:45:05.992 --> 00:45:14.717
WIL: I'm impatient. Perception 20. Is there
anything around that indicates where, which of

00:45:14.717 --> 00:45:20.153
these four directions is the best direction to
go?

00:45:20.153 --> 00:45:28.049
MATT: Knowing the city for the while that you've
been here, you know there are places of open

00:45:28.049 --> 00:45:32.094
business that have a lot of traffic are also
good places to ask for if anyone has seen anything

00:45:32.094 --> 00:45:37.123
that might match a certain description, or an
individual that you are seeking, any strange

00:45:37.123 --> 00:45:42.974
behavior. And so you know that the center of the
Quad Roads where that bazaar is, is a good place

00:45:42.974 --> 00:45:46.644
to start requesting information as you have
currently none at your disposal.

00:45:46.644 --> 00:45:51.062
MARISHA: Just to get this clear, a rakshasa's not
a beast?

00:45:51.062 --> 00:45:53.425
MATT: It's like a man.

00:45:53.425 --> 00:45:55.087
WILL and ORION: It's a demon.

00:45:55.087 --> 00:45:57.658
MATT: It's a demon creature that looks like a
man.

00:45:57.658 --> 00:46:00.864
MARISHA: But it's not a beast, by definition?

00:46:00.864 --> 00:46:02.074
MATT: No.

00:46:02.074 --> 00:46:07.962
LIAM: I'm sorry. I'd like to make an insight check
on the dwarf, not to see if he is lying, but he

00:46:07.962 --> 00:46:11.874
could be. Can I get a gut instinct into what his
deal is?

00:46:11.874 --> 00:46:14.149
MATT: Go ahead and make an insight check.

00:46:14.149 --> 00:46:21.932
LIAM: Three, but I'm going to use my Luck to try
that again. 18 plus two is 20.

00:46:21.932 --> 00:46:25.819
MATT: Would you like to go ahead and roll a 20?

00:46:25.819 --> 00:46:31.351
WIL: Yeah, that's a two. All right.

00:46:31.351 --> 00:46:34.362
(laughter)

00:46:34.362 --> 00:46:39.176
LIAM: Just reinforce the myth, man.

00:46:39.176 --> 00:46:50.490
WIL: That's one better than I usually roll. I'd
say it's twice as good as I usually do.

00:46:50.490 --> 00:46:59.792
MATT: Gruff exterior. There is definitely a
toughened past to him. He seems driven. Not

00:46:59.792 --> 00:47:07.157
necessarily untrustworthy, per se, but definitely
a man of little patience and currently does not

00:47:07.157 --> 00:47:10.689
seem to be too pleased with the fact that he's
essentially babysitting, in his mind.

00:47:10.689 --> 00:47:12.456
LIAM: Is there a marshmallow center?

00:47:12.456 --> 00:47:17.861
MATT: You may find out in due time. Yet that is
too hard to read at this moment.

00:47:17.861 --> 00:47:24.803
WILL: If you're in the bazaar, do I have to be out
of the city to cast Locate Creature?

00:47:24.803 --> 00:47:28.982
MATT: You can cast that anywhere you want to. Your
magic is divine. This is your city.

00:47:28.982 --> 00:47:31.432
LIAM: And that's not just a descriptor, either.

00:47:31.432 --> 00:47:40.739
WILL: Thank you. It's normally fabulous, but not
in this city. So then how do I go about casting

00:47:40.739 --> 00:47:42.071
Locate Creature?

00:47:42.071 --> 00:47:43.381
MATT: You can just tell me.

00:47:43.381 --> 00:47:45.466
WILL: I'd like to go ahead and cast Locate
Creature.

00:47:45.466 --> 00:47:48.774
MATT: All right, so as you guys are having this
discussion, you're having this weird stare-off and

00:47:48.774 --> 00:47:53.559
considering where to go in the bazaar. You stop in
the nearby alley two buildings down from where the

00:47:53.559 --> 00:47:57.874
Slayer's Take Guildhall is. And you begin just
taking a small dagger from your side and carving a

00:47:57.874 --> 00:48:07.071
circle in the ground. Throw some runes down that
are specific to your patron. Take a moment and

00:48:07.071 --> 00:48:16.373
concentrate on the description of this rakshasa.
Looking at the specifics of the spell to make sure

00:48:16.373 --> 00:48:26.264
that I don't give you misinformation... Locate
Creature. Beautiful.

00:48:26.264 --> 00:48:29.209
WILL: You guys have jazz hands.

00:48:29.209 --> 00:48:31.505
ORION and WILL: Rakshasa.

00:48:31.505 --> 00:48:37.537
MATT: You focus your mind for a second, and your
holy symbol begins to drift up from underneath

00:48:37.537 --> 00:48:42.488
your armor. You instinctively take and slap it
down underneath, and then refocus your vision,

00:48:42.488 --> 00:48:47.647
your eyes closed. And you can see what looks like
a pulsing energy, like a very dark flame.

00:48:47.647 --> 00:48:52.988
Something that itself, you can already smell the
sulfur. You can smell the lineage, the devil

00:48:52.988 --> 00:49:01.387
lineage that this entity is. And there is indeed
one not too terribly far from where you currently are.

00:49:01.387 --> 00:49:04.978
It's faint, which means that it is on the
outskirts. And you know this lasts for a good

00:49:04.978 --> 00:49:11.465
thousand feet or so. But it does give you a
northeastern direction. And the spell fades.

00:49:11.465 --> 00:49:13.742
MARISHA: Northeastern direction.

00:49:13.742 --> 00:49:20.315
WILL: We should go northeast. It is also
unfortunately, or fortunately, depending on how

00:49:20.315 --> 00:49:22.600
you look at it, closer than we thought.

00:49:22.600 --> 00:49:24.555
LIAM: In the walls of the city?

00:49:24.555 --> 00:49:27.606
WILL: Not in the walls, but very close to them.

00:49:27.606 --> 00:49:33.045
MARISHA: Do we have any type of plan of attack?
Does anyone know how to fight these things? Any

00:49:33.045 --> 00:49:34.350
earthly clue?

00:49:34.350 --> 00:49:35.398
WILL: Leader boy?

00:49:35.398 --> 00:49:37.085
MARISHA: Leader boy?

00:49:37.085 --> 00:49:39.162
WIL: I'm sorry, are you talking to me?

00:49:39.162 --> 00:49:41.339
ORION: Thorbir is what they meant to say.

00:49:41.339 --> 00:49:43.281
WILL: Listen to Stormfather over here.

00:49:43.281 --> 00:49:47.482
MARISHA: I take my social cues from other people. I'm
sorry.

00:49:47.482 --> 00:49:49.910
WIL: In my experience, there has not been a
problem invented

00:49:49.910 --> 00:49:51.863
that can't be solved with an axe.

00:49:51.863 --> 00:49:54.435
ORION: That's true. We've seen that.

00:49:54.435 --> 00:49:56.300
WILL: Wonderfully helpful. Thank you.

00:49:56.300 --> 00:49:57.557
WIL: You're welcome.

00:49:57.557 --> 00:49:59.008
LIAM: Follow the axe.

00:49:59.008 --> 00:50:06.167
WIL: Now what I want you to do is imagine an 
hourglass. You got that? Good picture of an hourglass

00:50:06.208 --> 00:50:11.693
in your heads? See all that sand draining out?
Let's get a move on.

00:50:11.693 --> 00:50:14.746
ORION: Okay. What am I doing with this sand?

00:50:14.746 --> 00:50:20.267
MARISHA: I agree with that. Are we supposed to do
something with the sand?

00:50:20.267 --> 00:50:22.092
WIL: Yeah, count it.

00:50:22.092 --> 00:50:26.022
MARISHA: Oh, that would take so long. Can we
tag-team this?

00:50:26.022 --> 00:50:27.787
WIL: She always like this?

00:50:27.787 --> 00:50:29.040
ORION: Yes.

00:50:29.040 --> 00:50:38.014
WILL: Stormcloud's counting sand. I don't know
what she's doing over here. Northeast. How about

00:50:38.014 --> 00:50:42.352
let's start walking that way and see what happens? Can
we give that a shot?

00:50:42.352 --> 00:50:44.990
ORION: I agree. You did the fancy spell.

00:50:44.990 --> 00:50:47.829
WILL: It's not as fancy as you might think.

00:50:47.829 --> 00:50:56.321
WIL: I've pulled my axe out and I'm sort of
holding it like a walking stick. And just very

00:50:56.321 --> 00:51:01.387
deliberately, very demonstratively walking ahead
in that direction.

00:51:01.387 --> 00:51:04.485
MATT: With each footfall, you know that what was
once, probably hundreds of years ago, a nice

00:51:04.485 --> 00:51:12.749
cobblestone roadway in the center of the city has
been slowly hit with mud, dirt, snow, sleet, and

00:51:12.749 --> 00:51:16.913
so each step is a slight moisture with each
footfall.

00:51:16.913 --> 00:51:19.510
ORION: I'm assuming there's no stables around.

00:51:19.598 --> 00:51:22.649
MATT: Not immediately, those are usually to the
very outside of the city.

00:51:22.649 --> 00:51:25.082
LIAM: Why are you jonesing for a horse?

00:51:25.082 --> 00:51:29.931
ORION: So I don't get all dirty.

00:51:29.931 --> 00:51:40.468
MATT: Thorbir, leading forward in the northeastern
direction that was given by Brother Kash,

00:51:40.468 --> 00:51:48.471
eventually brings you around the side of the
bazaar. And you can now see why it's called the

00:51:48.471 --> 00:51:52.404
Quad Roads, there are two main roads that meet
right where the bazaar occurs and then they spread

00:51:52.404 --> 00:51:56.880
off into the other sections of the city. To the
northeastern section, from your guys' perspective,

00:51:56.880 --> 00:52:05.253
the district begins to drift into another district
that you have not previously visited. This

00:52:05.253 --> 00:52:11.936
district is, you've heard it mentioned before,
known as the Duskmeadow. Now, previous sections

00:52:11.936 --> 00:52:17.493
you've been in have been worshipers of Bahamut,
the Platinum Dragon. There was the Braving

00:52:17.493 --> 00:52:23.116
Grounds, which worships Kord, the god of strength
and warfare and honor. The Quad Roads, which is

00:52:23.116 --> 00:52:29.733
under Erathis, the deity of civilization and
invention. The Duskmeadow falls under the watchful

00:52:29.733 --> 00:52:40.071
eye of the Raven Queen, the goddess of death. That
large obsidian-type structure that you were led

00:52:40.071 --> 00:52:45.213
to earlier is the temple that resides in the
center of this district. And you've heard mention

00:52:45.213 --> 00:52:49.168
before of a few of the things that exist here.
That being probably Raven's Crest, which is

00:52:49.298 --> 00:52:55.207
the main temple to the Raven Queen. This is also
where the Amaranthine Oubliette is located, which

00:52:55.207 --> 00:52:58.508
is essentially the prison of the entire city of
Vasselheim.

00:52:58.508 --> 00:53:00.132
MARISHA: The what?

00:53:00.132 --> 00:53:02.114
MATT: The Amaranthine Oubliette.

00:53:02.114 --> 00:53:08.640
ORION: Hammertime oubliette.

00:53:08.640 --> 00:53:10.697
MARISHA: Oh, there it is.

00:53:10.697 --> 00:53:17.927
MATT: This is also where most of the dead of the
city are interred into a series of catacombs that

00:53:17.927 --> 00:53:24.791
are built deep beneath this section of the city.
Far enough away from the oubliette to the point

00:53:24.791 --> 00:53:28.859
where isn't crossover and is enough of an escape,
because that apparently has happened in the past

00:53:28.909 --> 00:53:33.779
history of the city. As you begin pushing towards the
edge of where the two districts meet, you can see

00:53:33.825 --> 00:53:41.273
that there is an area of the town that, for lack of
better term, it's a more jovial than expected

00:53:41.273 --> 00:53:46.386
area. There are a series of stands put up along
the side of the road. There's a lot of beggars

00:53:46.386 --> 00:53:50.868
sitting on the side of the street that are
currently panhandling to those who walk by. There

00:53:50.868 --> 00:53:57.220
are a number of taverns. You can hear music coming
from various establishments. And it seems almost

00:53:57.220 --> 00:54:02.638
the closer you get to the death-oriented district
on the border of the Quad Roads, the more and more

00:54:02.638 --> 00:54:13.041
it pushes into a shadier Mardi Gras-type
experience. So you make your way towards that

00:54:13.041 --> 00:54:17.648
dividing line there. What you would like to do?

00:54:17.648 --> 00:54:19.511
ORION: What say you, Thorbir?

00:54:19.511 --> 00:54:24.485
WIL: Let's ask around and see if anything has been
a little out the ordinary, or maybe,

00:54:24.485 --> 00:54:26.895
in the ordinary.

00:54:26.895 --> 00:54:31.175
ORION: Yes, I like that phrasing.

00:54:31.175 --> 00:54:37.296
WILL: Have to imagine anywhere this thing goes,
there's going to be strange deaths associated with

00:54:37.296 --> 00:54:39.131
it. We might as well look there.

00:54:39.131 --> 00:54:42.377
ORION: That's actually a good idea, as well.

00:54:42.377 --> 00:54:48.073
LIAM: And where we're walking, are there shops and
stands, as well, or is it residential?

00:54:48.073 --> 00:54:55.245
MATT: There are many that sell jewelry, many that
sell very well-made clothing, some of them party

00:54:55.245 --> 00:55:02.675
attire, there are some that sell exotic fruits
that have been imported in various states of ripeness.

00:55:02.675 --> 00:55:04.987
MARISHA: Is anyone selling any masks?

00:55:04.987 --> 00:55:07.347
MATT: Make a perception check.

00:55:07.347 --> 00:55:13.432
MARISHA: Passive or active?

00:55:13.432 --> 00:55:15.832
MATT: That would be an active perception check as
you're seeking it.

00:55:15.832 --> 00:55:17.068
MARISHA: 21.

00:55:17.068 --> 00:55:22.690
MATT: 21. You do glance around and there is one
cart that carries costume, party attire supplies.

00:55:22.690 --> 00:55:25.380
It doesn't seem to have too many customers right
now, but they do have

00:55:25.380 --> 00:55:28.271
a couple of masks that are on display.

00:55:28.324 --> 00:55:31.663
MARISHA: Are there any masks that look like tiger
masks?

00:55:31.663 --> 00:55:36.498
MATT: Looking at it, there are none that are
tiger-specific, no. They seem to be molded leather

00:55:36.498 --> 00:55:40.541
and some more impish, goblin-y in appearance.

00:55:40.541 --> 00:55:44.122
MARISHA: Is there someone working the stand?

00:55:44.122 --> 00:55:51.313
MATT: There is, yes. You see a woman in her
forties or so, thin, with a big toothy smile. Her

00:55:51.313 --> 00:55:55.046
hair is pulled back into tight bun. You can see
there's little bit of her blondish hair turning to

00:55:55.046 --> 00:55:57.184
gray on the sides around her ears, Reed Richard-style.

00:55:57.184 --> 00:56:02.358
ORION: Did you say this was the Bahamut part of
town, too?

00:56:02.358 --> 00:56:08.906
MATT: The Bahamut section is far away. That's
another section of the city. You are now on the

00:56:08.906 --> 00:56:14.422
line between the Duskmeadow and the Quad Roads, so
it's Erathis and the Raven Queen.

00:56:14.422 --> 00:56:18.689
LIAM: I'm pulling a mask off the wall. This is a
beautiful piece. Do you make them yourself?

00:56:18.689 --> 00:56:23.353
MATT: "I do. I do, I make them myself by hand,
hence the price."

00:56:23.353 --> 00:56:31.157
LIAM: They are quite beautiful. We're travelers
here. I've never seen a neighborhood like this. Is

00:56:31.157 --> 00:56:35.154
there a festival going on here, or is this pretty
much the basic fare of the day here?

00:56:35.154 --> 00:56:38.858
MATT: "This is the localized festival of the city.
If you've been around Vasselheim long enough

00:56:38.858 --> 00:56:44.183
"you've seen there is little interest in
celebration depending on some places. But, at

00:56:44.183 --> 00:56:51.032
"least on this line, some people can appreciate the
fleetness that is life and grasp it by the roots

00:56:51.032 --> 00:56:52.740
"and make it its own before it's snuffed out."

00:56:52.740 --> 00:56:59.031
LIAM: Here particularly, there seems to be
electricity in the air almost. It's very bustling.

00:56:59.031 --> 00:57:01.771
This is the norm around here?

00:57:01.771 --> 00:57:07.188
MATT: "Consistently. That's why I come and bring
my business here. I wouldn't do very well up

00:57:07.188 --> 00:57:12.476
"north, I'll tell you that. All them dragon
types--" Looks to you. "No offense. All them

00:57:12.535 --> 00:57:18.176
"silver dragon lovers have an issue with things as
celebratory."

00:57:18.176 --> 00:57:25.647
LIAM: And I pull out ten gold, and I spread them
on her desk.

00:57:25.647 --> 00:57:27.087
MATT: "How many masks?"

00:57:27.087 --> 00:57:28.354
LIAM: Oh, none.

00:57:28.354 --> 00:57:29.959
MARISHA: Oh, I would like one.

00:57:29.959 --> 00:57:31.425
MATT: "Take your pick."

00:57:31.425 --> 00:57:36.584
LIAM: I slide one coin away from the other nine,
and then dragging my finger across those say, is

00:57:36.584 --> 00:57:41.374
there anything out of the ordinary these days?

00:57:41.374 --> 00:57:45.582
MATT: Go ahead and make a persuasion roll.

00:57:45.582 --> 00:57:48.421
LIAM: 15.

00:57:48.421 --> 00:58:01.641
MATT: 15? She gives you a look like she's trying
to read you, looks about left and right. Glances

00:58:01.641 --> 00:58:07.532
at you and looks a little ugh. Glances at you and
looks really taken aback, and then comes back to you

00:58:07.532 --> 00:58:09.745
with a escape of comfort.

00:58:09.745 --> 00:58:15.612
LIAM: Watching her, I pull out another five and
spread them in front of the first nine.

00:58:15.612 --> 00:58:24.491
MATT: "Well, I mean, some businesses here are a
bit shady, I won't lie. And there are some

00:58:24.491 --> 00:58:34.222
"long-standing businesses that have quarrels.
Usually, they end in small scuffles, or one

00:58:34.222 --> 00:58:42.834
"purchases the other and ousts them from the city.
This is one of the few areas in which the more adult pleasures can be

00:58:42.834 --> 00:58:48.501
"found, so there's a lot of money to be had. But
recently, there's been, at least from what I've

00:58:48.501 --> 00:58:55.462
"heard, a series of bodies have turned up. There
were a few found, fished out by the Bastions in

00:58:55.462 --> 00:59:00.050
"the water trough on the outskirts of the
Duskmeadow."

00:59:00.050 --> 00:59:02.391
LIAM: The Bastions: what are they?

00:59:02.391 --> 00:59:10.376
MATT: "Bastions who are the guardians of the city.
From what I hear, they had been mauled by some

00:59:10.376 --> 00:59:12.101
"sort of strange beast."

00:59:12.101 --> 00:59:13.890
LIAM: Mauled?

00:59:13.890 --> 00:59:17.267
MATT: "Now, beasts on the outside of the city,
that I can see. But on the inside, that is the

00:59:17.267 --> 00:59:19.311
"stuff of nightmares. Is it not?"

00:59:19.311 --> 00:59:21.818
ORION: Yes, I would agree.

00:59:21.818 --> 00:59:25.750
MARISHA: Have you had invaders like this before?

00:59:25.750 --> 00:59:34.277
MATT: "I mean, death is not an uncommon occurrence
for certain areas of the city." And she gestures

00:59:34.277 --> 00:59:41.386
off to the distant temple. "Some people invite it,
even. But such violent death like this is usually

00:59:41.386 --> 00:59:46.917
"kept to the outside of the city, at least with
some sort of cause. This seems to be a murderous

00:59:46.917 --> 00:59:51.296
"rampage that, me personally, I don't want to go
out at night without protection."

00:59:51.296 --> 00:59:55.727
MARISHA: Is there is any indication of the cause
of death on these corpses? How do they find them?

00:59:55.727 --> 00:59:59.975
MATT: "I don't know. I've not investigated.
Perhaps you have to ask the Bastions yourself

00:59:59.975 --> 01:00:01.840
"that. Or anyone who was in the vicinity."

01:00:01.840 --> 01:00:04.017
LIAM: And can you point us in the right
direction?

01:00:04.149 --> 01:00:10.933
MATT: She looks around, and points off. And you
can see, there isn't a whole lot of Bastion

01:00:10.933 --> 01:00:16.580
presence in this portion of the city, especially
since the Bastions are more of a voluntary guard.

01:00:16.580 --> 01:00:23.282
People from the different clergies, the different
temples, train to become Bastions, and fit

01:00:23.282 --> 01:00:28.863
themselves with whatever their deity's armor is. You
do see there are two Bastions armored in a very

01:00:28.863 --> 01:00:37.032
dark, dark brown leather that carry a symbol of
what looks like a silver raven that is embroidered

01:00:37.032 --> 01:00:39.882
on one shoulder of a cloak that is tossed to one
side.

01:00:39.882 --> 01:00:41.615
LIAM: These guys are right here, essentially?

01:00:41.615 --> 01:00:46.926
MATT: Yeah. Oh. They're across the road about
maybe a block up. "I believe they're Bastions from

01:00:46.926 --> 01:00:49.082
"the Duskmeadow. Perhaps you could ask them."

01:00:49.082 --> 01:00:52.316
MARISHA: Does she have any masks that look like a
raven? A raven mask?

01:00:52.350 --> 01:00:54.592
MATT: She does actually have one that looks like a
raven.

01:00:54.592 --> 01:00:55.887
MARISHA: I want that one.

01:00:55.887 --> 01:01:00.301
MATT: "Very well. A good choice. It doesn't quite
match the color of your attire, but perhaps I have

01:01:00.301 --> 01:01:01.931
"an outfit that could match for you?"

01:01:01.931 --> 01:01:02.958
MARISHA: Oh!

01:01:02.958 --> 01:01:05.032
WILL: Oh my god, we're going clothes shopping.

01:01:05.032 --> 01:01:10.276
MARISHA: Do you have a little cloak as well? A
little cape?

01:01:10.276 --> 01:01:13.942
MATT: "Cloaks I don't, but there but there is a
cloakery about four blocks that way on your left.

01:01:13.942 --> 01:01:15.748
"They can probably help you there."

01:01:15.748 --> 01:01:16.899
MARISHA: Thank you so much.

01:01:16.899 --> 01:01:18.142
MATT: "Of course."

01:01:18.142 --> 01:01:22.162
LIAM: I notice a serpent-shaped mask on the wall.
I just pick it up and put it on and say, thank

01:01:22.162 --> 01:01:27.218
you, madam. Much obliged. And walk off and clap
Thorbir on the shoulder and keep walking.

01:01:27.218 --> 01:01:34.775
WIL: Thorbir hangs back a little bit and waits for
them to get to the door. And he looks at the shop

01:01:34.775 --> 01:01:42.356
keep and, do you have any masks that might fit a
little girl?

01:01:42.356 --> 01:01:51.449
MATT: "Yes, of course, friend dwarf." And she goes
and rummages through a small bag and pulls out a

01:01:51.449 --> 01:02:00.125
mask. This little purple mask that seems to have
small fake gems forming the outside, with a

01:02:00.125 --> 01:02:05.207
couple of ribbons that dangle where it would tie around
the head. It's simple, but it's pretty.

01:02:05.207 --> 01:02:10.253
"Unfortunately, not many people bring children to
this side of the district. They don't sell very

01:02:10.253 --> 01:02:16.035
"well. But if you would like one, I would be happy
to part with for two gold?"

01:02:16.035 --> 01:02:20.453
WIL: One gold.

01:02:20.453 --> 01:02:25.350
MATT: Make a persuasion roll.

01:02:25.350 --> 01:02:26.745
WIL: 18.

01:02:26.745 --> 01:02:36.376
MATT: "One gold. Guess it is better to sell it
than not at all. Here you are. I must say, I won't

01:02:36.376 --> 01:02:45.953
"tell anyone, but purple is a pretty color on you."

01:02:45.953 --> 01:02:55.148
WIL: Yes, it is. He walks out.

01:02:55.148 --> 01:03:01.705
MATT: All right. A few moments pass as you wonder
where your dwarven leader has vanished to, he

01:03:01.705 --> 01:03:05.398
steps out through the front of the establishment.

01:03:05.398 --> 01:03:09.134
WIL: Let's go.

01:03:09.134 --> 01:03:16.502
ORION: Great. Do you have potions? Are you all
potioned up? Are you good on items, Thorbir?

01:03:16.502 --> 01:03:20.242
WIL: I'm all right. Are you all right?

01:03:20.242 --> 01:03:22.273
ORION: I'm just fine.

01:03:22.273 --> 01:03:27.640
LIAM: Well, we're in a rush, but if it's easy. How
do you come by potions in this town?

01:03:27.640 --> 01:03:29.821
WIL: Do I know the answer to that?

01:03:29.821 --> 01:03:35.322
MATT: You do. They're either provided, from some
of your experience, by the Slayer's Take, but

01:03:35.322 --> 01:03:39.028
those are usually offered at the start of a
contract. The fact that they weren't offered on

01:03:39.028 --> 01:03:45.703
this means either they don't have any currently at
their disposal, or they felt that this contract

01:03:45.703 --> 01:03:53.475
probably wouldn't require it with the construct of
this group being set out. Other than that, they

01:03:53.475 --> 01:03:58.718
are a little hard to come by. A lot of them are
controlled by the main temples and are pretty much

01:03:58.718 --> 01:04:04.388
given straight to the Bastions. There aren't a
lot of individuals that are in need of them within

01:04:04.388 --> 01:04:09.000
the city, and those that travel out are either
members of the Slayer's Take or members of the

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:13.048
Bastion forces. So they are little hard to come
by.

01:04:13.048 --> 01:04:18.377
WIL: I think that if we're going to find them
anywhere, it might be around here. Might be we can

01:04:18.377 --> 01:04:23.716
take some through trade. Maybe some might fall off
a Bastion or two.

01:04:23.716 --> 01:04:27.318
ORION: Well, let's go talk to one then, shall we?

01:04:27.318 --> 01:04:30.735
WILL: Thought that's what we were doing. Are
going to the two Bastions over there or what?

01:04:30.735 --> 01:04:32.430
ORION: Yes, Kashaw.

01:04:32.430 --> 01:04:37.599
WILL: Good. One other thing you need to know about
them: they're horribly paid, so money talks with

01:04:37.599 --> 01:04:38.965
these people.

01:04:38.965 --> 01:04:40.592
ORION: Very well.

01:04:40.592 --> 01:04:48.601
MARISHA: As he goes ahead, I keep up my pace until
I trail behind him a little bit.

01:04:48.601 --> 01:04:50.806
WILL: Wonderful.

01:04:50.806 --> 01:04:54.502
LIAM: My hood goes up, and I'm gone.

01:04:54.502 --> 01:04:59.190
MATT: All right. As you guys step across the way.
It's about a block up. One of them is partially

01:04:59.190 --> 01:05:02.662
inside the alley between two of the buildings. You
can see he has one hand up on the wall and the

01:05:02.662 --> 01:05:06.099
other down. One of them is relieving himself on
the side of the building, while the other is

01:05:06.099 --> 01:05:10.951
keeping watch, arms crossed, looking out across the
road. The one that's immediately present, or

01:05:10.951 --> 01:05:17.006
before you, you can see is human, a
scruffy brown beard around the edge of the chin.

01:05:17.006 --> 01:05:25.494
The hair itself is cut very short. A little
heavier in appearance. A little muscle, a little

01:05:25.494 --> 01:05:33.346
layer of winter padding, but the black leather
armor definitely gives you the appearance of

01:05:33.346 --> 01:05:38.965
somebody who is a Bastion of the Raven Queen. As
you approach, the hooded half-elf, the dwarf

01:05:38.965 --> 01:05:46.367
walking with the giant axe, and the bumbling
dragonborn, the human cleric with a very angry

01:05:46.367 --> 01:05:53.680
disposition, and the awkward half-elf druid
stepping in pace with him. Gives you all a cursory

01:05:53.680 --> 01:05:56.357
look and immediately puts a hand to his side where
you can see that there is a rapier currently

01:05:56.357 --> 01:06:01.009
sheathed. "Aye, you walk with purpose."

01:06:01.009 --> 01:06:04.395
WIL: We walk for the Guild.

01:06:04.395 --> 01:06:07.145
MATT: "Slayer's Take it is?"

01:06:07.145 --> 01:06:08.531
WIL: It is.

01:06:08.531 --> 01:06:12.132
MATT: "What business have you on this side of
town, then? Aren't you supposed to be out past the

01:06:12.174 --> 01:06:13.966
"walls killing creatures and such?"

01:06:13.966 --> 01:06:17.583
WIL: Our business takes us where our business
takes us. Our business brings us here today.

01:06:17.583 --> 01:06:19.810
MATT: "All right, then what's your business?"

01:06:19.810 --> 01:06:22.735
WIL: You might be having some trouble?

01:06:22.735 --> 01:06:24.927
MATT: "Aye."

01:06:24.927 --> 01:06:32.251
WIL: What's causing you trouble and what's going
to get us out of here might be the same thing.

01:06:32.251 --> 01:06:39.585
MATT: The gentleman to the left of him finishes
shaking off the rest of his alleyway journey.

01:06:39.585 --> 01:06:43.137
WILL: Any more than twice and you're just playing
with it, pal.

01:06:43.137 --> 01:06:53.384
MATT: He turns around and throws his tunic over.
"Excuse me, it's official Bastion business.

01:06:53.384 --> 01:06:57.981
"Anyway." And he nods over to the bearded gentleman
who's standing there.

01:06:57.981 --> 01:07:06.657
"There are certain bits of business that are
official in this town. I don't know how honestly

01:07:06.657 --> 01:07:11.917
"right it is to be talking with common folk, or even the
Guild who does what it likes."

01:07:11.917 --> 01:07:15.698
WIL: I'm sorry, you're not talking to common
folk.

01:07:15.698 --> 01:07:17.263
WILL: He wants money.

01:07:17.263 --> 01:07:20.003
WIL: I know what he wants.

01:07:20.003 --> 01:07:22.757
WILL: Well, then give to him so we can get out of
here.

01:07:22.757 --> 01:07:25.004
LIAM: I'm circling around.

01:07:25.004 --> 01:07:30.500
MATT: Make a stealth check.

01:07:30.500 --> 01:07:32.719
LIAM: 31.

01:07:32.719 --> 01:07:40.347
MATT: I'm not even going to roll. I'm going to ask
you to go ahead and you can choose if you want

01:07:40.347 --> 01:07:42.750
persuasion or intimidation on this. You're riding
that line.

01:07:42.750 --> 01:07:52.281
WIL: I'm equally bad at both of them. But I think
that Thorbir wants to go intimidation. I'll give

01:07:52.281 --> 01:07:56.203
that a try. There it is!

01:07:56.203 --> 01:07:57.866
ORION: 20?

01:07:57.866 --> 01:08:00.586
WIL: What's the exact opposite of that?

01:08:00.586 --> 01:08:02.955
(laughter)

01:08:02.955 --> 01:08:06.585
MATT: You know, I've heard about it for so long.

01:08:06.585 --> 01:08:12.278
WIL: I know, right? You can't believe that it's a
real thing until you're actually there.

01:08:12.278 --> 01:08:16.090
LIAM: Everybody talks about spontaneous
combustion, but I'd never believed it.

01:08:16.090 --> 01:08:24.062
WIL: It's silly. It's so silly to do this.

01:08:24.062 --> 01:08:25.698
MARISHA: Dice shame.

01:08:25.698 --> 01:08:28.397
LIAM: Naughty.

01:08:28.397 --> 01:08:36.626
MATT: I don't know what ancient Aztec deity's
temple you defaced when you were a child, but man.

01:08:36.626 --> 01:08:40.665
All right, so as you lean forward--

01:08:40.665 --> 01:08:42.599
WIL: Please, just let me step into a bucket.

01:08:42.599 --> 01:08:45.363
(laughter)

01:08:45.363 --> 01:08:53.436
MATT: We'll get to that. As you lean forward,
forcing your presence on this Bastion, his hand's

01:08:53.436 --> 01:08:58.742
still holding the edge of his rapier. He steps
forward into you, to the point where you're almost

01:08:58.742 --> 01:09:07.013
forehead to forehead. "Sorry, I have to lean down
to reach your level. But if you're going to go

01:09:07.013 --> 01:09:14.870
"about asking questions and not offering proper
compensation for information, well, then. I think

01:09:14.870 --> 01:09:17.372
"we have no business here."

01:09:17.372 --> 01:09:26.929
WIL: If it's compensation you're looking for,
let's just speak plain. And I pull out four gold.

01:09:26.929 --> 01:09:34.288
LIAM: And while he has their attention, I'm going
to check out his pockets.

01:09:34.288 --> 01:09:39.824
MATT: Go ahead and make a perception check.

01:09:39.824 --> 01:09:47.085
LIAM: Ew, that's not good. I'm going to use Luck.
That's better. That's all right. Perception, you

01:09:47.085 --> 01:09:48.368
said? 28.

01:09:48.368 --> 01:09:53.556
MATT: 28? Taking a moment as you sneak up behind the
one he's talking to-- the two guys are shoulder to

01:09:53.583 --> 01:09:57.693
shoulder, squaring off with the rest of this
group. The one that had been relieving himself in

01:09:57.744 --> 01:10:02.581
the alleyway is a little bit closer to you. You
can see as he put his tunic right and everything,

01:10:02.581 --> 01:10:06.997
he jostled around and revealed a couple of small
pouches on his side. One of which, you heard

01:10:06.997 --> 01:10:10.518
a clinking of glass on the inside. Go ahead and make
a sleight-of-hand check.

01:10:10.518 --> 01:10:15.089
MARISHA: Go rogue, go.

01:10:15.089 --> 01:10:19.909
LIAM: Because I'm wearing a Cloak of Elvenkind,
which I know affects stealth checks but not--

01:10:19.909 --> 01:10:21.896
MATT: Not sleight of hand, no.

01:10:21.896 --> 01:10:24.276
LIAM: That's all right. 20.

01:10:24.276 --> 01:10:35.620
MATT: 20. All right. You reach over and find the
edge of the leather loop that attaches itself to

01:10:35.620 --> 01:10:40.654
the side of this Bastion's belt. You tug ever
so gently to the side and the loop releases and

01:10:40.654 --> 01:10:55.006
you pull it off, seemingly without any noticing.
As you pull out the four gold from inside, the

01:10:55.006 --> 01:11:01.174
Bastion looks out and scoffs and goes, "Clearly,
pittance fee for this. What's to let me think

01:11:01.174 --> 01:11:05.992
"that you aren't actually part of this murder
scheme? You just walk up and try and start asking

01:11:05.992 --> 01:11:10.543
"questions like this. First off, where did you hear
about it? Second, you look like the kind that

01:11:10.543 --> 01:11:14.962
"would go ahead and be mauling folks in the street,
do you not, sir dwarf? You got the eyes of one

01:11:14.962 --> 01:11:17.329
"who's probably done a few dark deeds."

01:11:17.329 --> 01:11:22.050
WIL: Oh, I have. More than you can imagine.

01:11:22.050 --> 01:11:25.162
MATT: "Then explain to me why we shouldn't take
you in for questioning right now." And he pulls

01:11:25.162 --> 01:11:26.994
his rapier out.

01:11:26.994 --> 01:11:35.010
ORION: Hold on. Everybody calm down. Hi, I'm
Tiberius Stormwind. My friend Thorbir here

01:11:35.040 --> 01:11:37.060
didn't mean to offend, of course.

01:11:37.060 --> 01:11:45.587
MATT: The blade up toward your face. And he says,
"Look, dragon man, I was talking to the dwarf.

01:11:45.587 --> 01:11:53.913
"You, I have no business with at the moment. So.
You've got ten seconds before we take you in."

01:11:53.913 --> 01:12:08.754
WIL: I reach into my pocket and rattle my coins
around a little bit. Maybe I could buy us some

01:12:08.754 --> 01:12:14.749
time. And I drop ten gold out into my other hand.

01:12:14.749 --> 01:12:22.915
MATT: Make a persuasion roll.

01:12:22.915 --> 01:12:24.910
WILL: One! No, it isn't.

01:12:24.910 --> 01:12:26.551
MATT: Three.

01:12:26.551 --> 01:12:34.339
WIL: That's funny. I rolled a three on this die.
So that's going to be a six. Guys, I think we're

01:12:34.339 --> 01:12:37.660
fighting the Bastions. I feel like maybe it's
going that way.

01:12:37.660 --> 01:12:39.240
MARISHA: You rolled a one?

01:12:39.240 --> 01:12:40.593
MATT: I rolled one.

01:12:40.593 --> 01:12:44.136
MARISHA: You all have really low self-confidence.

01:12:44.136 --> 01:12:50.830
MATT: As you push forward the coins, in a
semi-awkward forceful manner, the Bastion himself

01:12:50.830 --> 01:12:56.365
also seems to be caught off-guard, and looks down,
and looks about. Realizing that now it looks like

01:12:56.365 --> 01:13:02.812
you are visibly out in the open, paying money to
the Bastions. He looks back. "People don't stand

01:13:02.812 --> 01:13:07.231
"out in public and do it!" And he pulls you all off
into the alleyway to the side of the complex. Out

01:13:07.231 --> 01:13:12.425
of the middle of the area into the shade between
the buildings. He reaches over and takes the coins

01:13:12.425 --> 01:13:22.367
from your hand and hurries them into a pocket.
"All right, look. I'll tell you what we know. But

01:13:22.367 --> 01:13:25.387
"if you're going to be messing around with this
investigation, I ask that you don't let anyone

01:13:25.387 --> 01:13:30.804
"know that you spoke with us. This is all on your
own. And if you do say anything, we'll deny it and

01:13:30.804 --> 01:13:35.415
"we'll make sure to put you in the Oubliette
yourself for this. All right?"

01:13:35.415 --> 01:13:36.612
ORION: Fair enough.

01:13:36.612 --> 01:13:38.609
WIL and WILL: All right.

01:13:38.609 --> 01:13:46.067
MATT: "Now, we have found a series of bodies over
the past few years, scattered about. A few months at

01:13:46.067 --> 01:13:53.370
"a time between. All with a similar pattern of death
to them. We found large portions, the meaty

01:13:53.370 --> 01:14:00.121
"portions of the body had been torn away, some of
them apparently eaten. There are marks that are

01:14:00.121 --> 01:14:06.910
"indicative of some sort of beast ravaging the
corpses, but no signs of a beast coming or going.

01:14:06.910 --> 01:14:10.681
"And we've had many of our finest trackers looking
for any sort of sign of a creature that may have

01:14:10.681 --> 01:14:15.754
"found its way into the city. They've been in the
rooftops, the gutters, perhaps even the sewers. No

01:14:15.754 --> 01:14:20.852
"sign of any such creature traveling amongst any of
these scenes.

01:14:20.852 --> 01:14:27.786
"Now, all of the bodies have been found wrapped up
and discarded in the canals. A lot of them

01:14:27.786 --> 01:14:35.326
"surrounding the Abundant Terrace." Looks at the
rest of you. "That's where Melora's eye is

01:14:35.326 --> 01:14:45.182
"watchful. What's really got us confused of late
is, the most recent murder that we found was a

01:14:45.182 --> 01:14:50.802
"very powerful merchant lord from Ank'harel, one
that's been in this city for no more than a month.

01:14:50.802 --> 01:14:56.317
"He's well-known in these parts as bringing in a lot
of business. His caravans come through via

01:14:56.317 --> 01:15:03.000
"various skyships. And he brings with himself an
influx of much-needed mercantile in the city."

01:15:03.003 --> 01:15:04.835
MARISHA: What's his name?

01:15:04.835 --> 01:15:08.128
MATT: "I'm not allowed to say."

01:15:08.128 --> 01:15:11.225
WILL: You're not allowed to say?

01:15:11.225 --> 01:15:15.415
MATT: "The merchant's name is Tyrell."

01:15:15.415 --> 01:15:17.214
MARISHA: What?

01:15:17.214 --> 01:15:24.644
MATT: "Tyrell. Lord Tyrell. If you say any of this
to any of our people, I swear I'll make your life

01:15:24.644 --> 01:15:29.129
"the hardest it's been in months. And from the
looks of you, you've had a very hard few months.

01:15:29.129 --> 01:15:39.851
"Lord Tyrell's body was found, but apparently
during the murder. We have one beggar that

01:15:39.851 --> 01:15:45.203
"apparently caught sight of this the murderer. 
As best as we can tell, it was some sort of

01:15:45.203 --> 01:15:50.975
"lycanthrope. The beggar was babbling, but it
seemed there was some sort of wolf-like creature.

01:15:50.975 --> 01:15:56.572
"It was seen bipedal walking a man, but tore this
man right through the throat, most of his chest.

01:15:56.572 --> 01:16:06.260
"But when spotted, didn't run, just vanished.
Disappeared. No longer in his sight. No tracks

01:16:06.260 --> 01:16:16.469
"left behind. Just gone. Didn't know if it was
angry poltergeist, ghost. But the last place he

01:16:16.469 --> 01:16:24.385
"was staying is at a recent establishment, only
been here a couple of years. Referred to as

01:16:24.385 --> 01:16:31.640
"the Velvet Cabaret. The Velvet Cabaret 
is a very high-end place."

01:16:31.640 --> 01:16:32.983
WILL: I know it well.

01:16:32.983 --> 01:16:35.300
MATT: "You do?" He gives you a look of--

01:16:35.300 --> 01:16:38.310
WILL: I've heard about it from somewhere else.

01:16:38.310 --> 01:16:40.456
ORION: Scanlan? Have you been talking to Scanlan?

01:16:40.456 --> 01:16:43.876
WILL: Don't know who that is, Stormshadow.

01:16:43.876 --> 01:16:47.407
ORION: He likes whores. Okay. It's weird.

01:16:47.407 --> 01:16:54.068
MATT: "The fact that that the lord had been
staying at the Velvet Cabaret for some time, and

01:16:54.068 --> 01:16:59.307
"we were feeling pretty close to possibly finding
the source of these murders. Our bastion force

01:16:59.307 --> 01:17:06.855
"from the Duskmeadow worked with the Quadroads and
we actually raided it. Found nothing. Nothing but

01:17:06.855 --> 01:17:13.368
"the patrons, no sign of any sort of foul play. We
were forced to leave empty handed. That's all

01:17:13.368 --> 01:17:16.105
"we've got."

01:17:16.105 --> 01:17:18.685
WILL: I have a question about the bodies. Have you
seen them?

01:17:18.685 --> 01:17:21.396
MATT: "I've only seen the most recent. The rest,
I've just heard of."

01:17:21.396 --> 01:17:25.633
WILL: Anything similar with them? Are they all
men? Are they all women? Are they children?

01:17:25.633 --> 01:17:34.527
MATT: "No children. Most of them seem to be well
off to do folk. Dressed well."

01:17:34.527 --> 01:17:39.729
WILL: Wealthy men and women? And you say you've
searched everywhere, including the catacombs?

01:17:39.729 --> 01:17:44.771
MATT: "Most. Catacombs themselves are sealed off.
We've asked around, and there's been no sign of

01:17:44.771 --> 01:17:48.572
"movement in or out. And gods forbid, anyone stays
in those places.

01:17:48.572 --> 01:17:50.160
"That's a nasty place to be staying."

01:17:50.160 --> 01:17:52.009
WILL: It is, indeed.

01:17:52.009 --> 01:17:58.997
ORION: Is there a way that the bastions could
organize some kind of gathering of sorts? Perhaps

01:17:58.997 --> 01:18:04.088
a mandatory town meeting, where all would have 
to gather for maybe

01:18:04.088 --> 01:18:06.843
an announcement or something official?

01:18:06.843 --> 01:18:11.882
MATT: "All the bastions? That's near impossible.
The city's scattered politically enough as it

01:18:11.882 --> 01:18:19.095
"is. People can be rallying whenever there's some
sort of force coming against the city. But when it

01:18:19.095 --> 01:18:24.294
"comes to nothing for any particular reason, just
the investigators take care of it themselves."

01:18:24.294 --> 01:18:28.202
WIL: He serves the Raven Queen, right? He's got
the Raven Queen patch on him?

01:18:28.202 --> 01:18:29.223
MATT: Yeah.

01:18:29.223 --> 01:18:38.397
WIL: This part of town, death isn't the worst
thing in the world. Lots of planes other than

01:18:38.397 --> 01:18:45.252
ours, might be you're a little bit closer than
some of the rest of us are; we're underneath the

01:18:45.252 --> 01:18:54.290
mountain. You wouldn't happen to know about anyone
performing any rituals or maybe opening up lines

01:18:54.290 --> 01:19:01.512
of communication that may have been made and
disturbed?

01:19:01.512 --> 01:19:07.392
MATT: "I certainly hope not. These sort of
communion rituals are sanctified and held within

01:19:07.392 --> 01:19:14.779
"the actual temple to the Raven Queen itself. If
anyone is doing any sort of business, there is a

01:19:14.779 --> 01:19:18.225
"very watchful eye over the city. Anything that is
unsanctioned,

01:19:18.225 --> 01:19:20.725
"I can guarantee we'll know about it."

01:19:27.415 --> 01:19:32.343
ORION: May we seek audience with this Raven
Queen?

01:19:32.343 --> 01:19:35.740
MARISHA: I mean, she's a goddess.

01:19:35.740 --> 01:19:37.609
ORION: Oh. She's not here?

01:19:37.609 --> 01:19:40.988
MARISHA: She's not a queen. She's a goddess.

01:19:40.988 --> 01:19:44.556
MATT: You can see the two the two bastions are
looking at each other with expression of

01:19:44.556 --> 01:19:46.373
"Really?"

01:19:46.373 --> 01:19:48.787
ORION: We're new around here.

01:19:48.787 --> 01:19:51.657
MATT: "Listen, we've talked long enough. We got to
get back to our posts."

01:19:51.657 --> 01:19:56.153
MARISHA: Oh, wait. You mentioned investigators?

01:19:56.153 --> 01:20:00.680
MATT: "There are different people assigned to
investigate. We were part of the team that was

01:20:00.680 --> 01:20:03.828
"sent as part of the investigation raid on the
Velvet Cabaret."

01:20:03.828 --> 01:20:09.771
MARISHA: It's not a group of people. It's just,
"you're an investigator today" kind of thing?

01:20:09.771 --> 01:20:12.043
MATT: "That's part of what we do as Bastions,
aye."

01:20:12.043 --> 01:20:15.159
MARISHA: Gotcha. Is there anyone else that is part
of the investigation team that you think would be

01:20:15.159 --> 01:20:16.746
good to talk to?

01:20:16.746 --> 01:20:19.190
MATT: "They wouldn't have any more information
than we do, no."

01:20:19.190 --> 01:20:21.211
MARISHA: Can I do an insight check on him?

01:20:21.211 --> 01:20:23.776
MATT: Yeah, go for it.

01:20:23.776 --> 01:20:27.580
MARISHA: 23.

01:20:27.580 --> 01:20:33.328
MATT: He seems forthright enough. He seems
impatient and a little flustered with the fact

01:20:33.328 --> 01:20:35.959
that you've been pushing these questions to him.
But he doesn't

01:20:35.959 --> 01:20:38.339
seem to be covering anything necessarily.

01:20:38.339 --> 01:20:41.640
WIL: Did he tell us where they found the-- I
didn't write this down.

01:20:41.640 --> 01:20:47.141
LIAM: And Lord Tyrell factored in how?

01:20:47.141 --> 01:20:52.480
WIL: Can you tell us where you found the body of
the merchant lord?

01:20:52.480 --> 01:20:58.750
MATT: "The body was found in the side alley to the
Velvet Cabaret."

01:20:58.750 --> 01:21:03.280
WILL: You said wrapped up? Or just the ones in the
river were wrapped up?

01:21:03.280 --> 01:21:08.239
MATT: "The ones that were found in the river, they
were wrapped up in blankets. Whatever put them

01:21:08.239 --> 01:21:13.191
"aside was not some beast. There was some
intelligence to this. And they were placed

01:21:13.191 --> 01:21:17.968
"deliberately, which means, I don't think there's
just one thing doing this."

01:21:17.968 --> 01:21:20.280
WILL: Were the blankets the same, or were they all
different?

01:21:20.280 --> 01:21:30.060
MATT: "They seemed to be different. Some were just
scattered cloths. Some were tattered sheets. Some

01:21:30.060 --> 01:21:35.532
"were bolts of fine material. Really varied. There
was no pattern to it."

01:21:35.532 --> 01:21:40.556
WILL: Was anything missing from Lord Tyrell?

01:21:40.556 --> 01:21:45.859
MATT: "Nothing more than his throat, his
trachea."

01:21:45.859 --> 01:21:51.647
LIAM: We've pumped these guys for all they've
got.

01:21:51.647 --> 01:21:56.159
WIL: You're all right. Sorry about that.

01:21:56.159 --> 01:22:06.312
MATT: "It's all right, just offer more coin up
front next time. Be well. And if you hear

01:22:06.312 --> 01:22:12.663
"anything, find any information, come straight to
us. Don't be getting into official business.

01:22:12.663 --> 01:22:20.859
"You're sanctified as a Slayer, but don't make us
look bad." They step around you guys, back out

01:22:20.859 --> 01:22:23.017
into the main street.

01:22:23.017 --> 01:22:24.355
WIL: Velvet Cabaret?

01:22:24.355 --> 01:22:25.910
MARISHA: Velvet Cabaret.

01:22:25.910 --> 01:22:27.229
WILL: It's close.

01:22:27.229 --> 01:22:35.923
MARISHA: So we know that this guy-- while we walk
there, I was talking. We know that this guy is a

01:22:35.923 --> 01:22:41.860
demon from the Nine Hells. So, he seems to be
targeting wealthy people. Do you think these are

01:22:41.860 --> 01:22:48.762
people that tried to get under his control, under
his servitude, and it didn't go his way, so he

01:22:48.762 --> 01:22:50.839
ended up killing them?

01:22:50.839 --> 01:22:58.732
WIL: Folk don't go into the Velvet Cabaret unless
they got a lot of coin. Someone like Lord Tyrell.

01:22:58.732 --> 01:23:01.969
Do we know anything about him? Does his name ring
any bells for us at all?

01:23:01.969 --> 01:23:03.247
MATT: Roll a history check.

01:23:03.247 --> 01:23:12.259
WIL: Oh boy. (laughs) It happened again!

01:23:12.259 --> 01:23:17.561
MATT: This is unprecedented. You are the
nega-Percy right now.

01:23:17.561 --> 01:23:20.633
WIL: Just telling you. I'm just telling you.

01:23:20.633 --> 01:23:22.341
MATT: This is impressive.

01:23:22.341 --> 01:23:26.620
WIL: You think it isn't real. You think it's a
thing I make jokes about.

01:23:26.620 --> 01:23:33.255
MATT: You take a moment to conjecture where you
may have heard the name. What was the name again?

01:23:33.255 --> 01:23:42.325
WIL: Oh, the guy from Battlestar Galactica. 
Oh, what was his name? Adama?

01:23:42.325 --> 01:23:46.034
MATT: You want to roll a history check?

01:23:46.034 --> 01:23:47.897
WILL: d20?

01:23:47.897 --> 01:23:50.419
MATT: d20 and add your history modifier.

01:23:50.419 --> 01:23:54.287
WILL: Add my history. 20. Total of 20.

01:23:54.287 --> 01:24:00.591
MATT: Total is 20? All right. You've heard of the
city of Ank'Harel. It's a desert city from a long

01:24:00.591 --> 01:24:06.212
ways away. But you aren't specifically aware of
this individual. You however, Kashaw, you know

01:24:06.212 --> 01:24:16.556
that Lord Tyrell has come through this city a few
times in the past year or so. You've only been

01:24:16.556 --> 01:24:22.372
here a short time yourself, but in the time that
you've been here, you've heard tales of this large

01:24:22.372 --> 01:24:27.953
caravan that comes through. And it is a parade. He
usually brings with him a good 13 different carts

01:24:27.953 --> 01:24:40.150
that contain all sorts of jewels and materials and
tapestries and fine silks, and it's almost a small

01:24:40.150 --> 01:24:46.822
party whenever this is this long walking caravan
is brought into the city. So you are aware of this

01:24:46.822 --> 01:24:50.824
individual. You're surprised that the death has be
kept so hush-hush.

01:24:50.824 --> 01:24:54.312
WILL: And are there rumors of about him bring in
anything else? Anything illicit? Or is it kind of

01:24:54.312 --> 01:24:55.735
"what you see is what you get?"

01:24:55.735 --> 01:24:59.927
MATT: As far as you know? No information that has
caught your ear per se, but the fact that he's

01:24:59.927 --> 01:25:01.413
staying in this district, who knows?

01:25:01.413 --> 01:25:10.140
WIL: Folks tend to stay-- Let me try that again.
Folk tend to stay with their own class. These

01:25:10.140 --> 01:25:18.388
victims are all wealthy folk. And they seem to
have the Velvet Cabaret in common. It's very

01:25:18.388 --> 01:25:24.716
likely that we're dealing with somebody who is
rich and powerful.

01:25:24.716 --> 01:25:26.866
WILL: What does a demon need money for?

01:25:26.866 --> 01:25:28.636
WIL: Who says he's after money?

01:25:28.636 --> 01:25:31.493
MARISHA: Seems to be after power.

01:25:31.493 --> 01:25:35.992
LIAM: Tyrell was passing through. I wonder how
many people would notice him gone

01:25:35.992 --> 01:25:37.992
here in Vasselheim.

01:25:37.992 --> 01:25:39.322
ORION: I'm sure quite a few.

01:25:39.322 --> 01:25:42.637
MARISHA: And it seems like it's no secret when he
comes to town.

01:25:42.637 --> 01:25:44.371
WILL: It was a party every time he showed up.

01:25:44.371 --> 01:25:48.935
MARISHA: And according to the guards, these
murders have been going on for the past few years,

01:25:48.935 --> 01:25:56.404
so it seems like whatever we're dealing with might
have time to plan ahead. If he's been aware of the

01:25:56.404 --> 01:26:02.251
past few times that Tyrell has come through the
town and could possibly know the next time he's

01:26:02.251 --> 01:26:04.242
coming through.

01:26:04.242 --> 01:26:10.266
ORION: And if we could pinpoint when it actually
started, we know years, but actually when, then we

01:26:10.266 --> 01:26:14.887
can actually narrow it down to the establishments
and other things that were established then.

01:26:14.887 --> 01:26:21.598
WIL: Would there be a place where we could inquire
as to some sort of ledger like that when this guy

01:26:21.598 --> 01:26:27.765
comes in and with the intention of trying to
correlate it with when different murders have

01:26:27.765 --> 01:26:34.496
happened? Actually, I take that back. Thorbir
doesn't think that deeply. That's not the thing

01:26:34.496 --> 01:26:40.947
that he wants to do. That sounds like a lot of
thinking and not a lot of hitting things.

01:26:40.947 --> 01:26:47.162
LIAM: This killer could be hiding in plain sight 
at the Cabaret. Could be an employee there.

01:26:47.162 --> 01:26:49.172
ORION: Or the owner himself.

01:26:49.172 --> 01:26:55.277
MARISHA: How long ago did the bastions say that
they raided the Velvet Cabaret?

01:26:55.277 --> 01:26:57.191
WILL: It was a month ago, wasn't it?

01:26:57.191 --> 01:27:00.231
MATT: It was a few weeks back when the murder
occurred, yeah.

01:27:00.231 --> 01:27:06.009
MARISHA: So here's my question: do you think he
would stick around after it was raided? Or do you

01:27:06.009 --> 01:27:07.154
think he'd move on?

01:27:07.154 --> 01:27:09.174
LIAM: The thing is vanishing upon sight.

01:27:09.174 --> 01:27:13.982
WILL: And gotten away with it for the last two or
three years. I don't think he cares much anymore.

01:27:13.982 --> 01:27:20.518
LIAM: My question is: we have three days,
Cabaret's the only lead we have. How do we draw

01:27:20.518 --> 01:27:23.191
this person, he or she, out?

01:27:23.191 --> 01:27:26.778
MARISHA: I believe it is three days.

01:27:26.778 --> 01:27:30.080
LIAM: We have three days to collar it.

01:27:30.080 --> 01:27:35.777
MATT: You have three days to complete the
contract, meaning slaying the entity you're

01:27:35.777 --> 01:27:37.124
contracted to.

01:27:37.124 --> 01:27:39.802
WILL: I was going to say that you look like a man
who knows wealth.

01:27:39.802 --> 01:27:40.986
ORION: Yes.

01:27:40.986 --> 01:27:42.955
LIAM: I've spent time with wealth.

01:27:42.955 --> 01:27:48.841
WILL: Well, I never have, so I would think maybe
if you were a merchant coming into

01:27:48.841 --> 01:27:51.869
town, very wealthy, looking for some adult
entertainment,

01:27:51.869 --> 01:27:56.133
might be a way to bring him out the forefront.

01:27:56.133 --> 01:28:03.204
ORION: Oh, I agree. I cast Alter Self on myself
and turn myself into an elf.

01:28:03.204 --> 01:28:04.609
You're half-elf right?

01:28:04.609 --> 01:28:05.721
LIAM: Half-elves.

01:28:05.721 --> 01:28:13.427
ORION: I'll turn into a half-elf, akin to a
high-born half elf.

01:28:13.427 --> 01:28:18.057
MATT: All right, fair enough. Even in comparison
to Vax, your attire is very nice.

01:28:18.057 --> 01:28:20.367
MARISHA: Does this mean that I should go change
clothes?

01:28:20.367 --> 01:28:22.845
WILL: You were going to go shopping.

01:28:22.845 --> 01:28:23.748
MARISHA: I was.

01:28:23.748 --> 01:28:26.484
ORION: You look okay.

01:28:26.484 --> 01:28:27.841
MARISHA: Thank you.

01:28:27.841 --> 01:28:32.285
LIAM: Let's go. I jingle what gold I have in a
pouch in front of Keyleth's face and say, let's go

01:28:32.285 --> 01:28:33.934
shopping. Come on.

01:28:33.934 --> 01:28:35.158
WIL: Shopping montage.

01:28:35.158 --> 01:28:41.974
MATT: As you guys go out shopping for better
looking, well-to-do attire, we'll go ahead and

01:28:41.974 --> 01:28:44.517
take a quick five-minute break and we'll return
here and as you guys continue to the next step of

01:28:44.517 --> 01:28:49.389
your hunt for the rakshasa.

01:28:49.389 --> 01:28:54.775
WIL: Oh, Tyrell! I just remembered.

01:28:54.775 --> 01:29:00.980
(laughter)

01:29:00.980 --> 01:29:03.557
WIL: What a silly thing to forget.

01:29:03.557 --> 01:29:09.535
LIAM: As the rakshasa bears down on your head.

01:29:09.535 --> 01:29:14.356
MATT: Last thing engraved on your tombstone. Yeah,
quick five-minute break. First off, before we get

01:29:14.356 --> 01:29:20.754
to that, guys: A big thank you to Negihama once
again, our patron saint of ridiculous gifts, who

01:29:20.754 --> 01:29:23.311
purchased these sconces to put on the wall.

01:29:23.311 --> 01:29:24.753
LIAM: They're legit.

01:29:24.753 --> 01:29:26.064
MARISHA: Aren't the sconces awesome?

01:29:26.064 --> 01:29:27.793
MATT: They are amazing.

01:29:27.793 --> 01:29:29.236
MARISHA: The LEDs change colors.

01:29:29.236 --> 01:29:33.036
MATT: Reminder: every hundred subs we're
giving away a signed picture and signed full-scale

01:29:33.036 --> 01:29:37.525
poster of Kit's art. And for the break, the
five-minute break we're going to take real fast,

01:29:37.525 --> 01:29:41.182
we have an awesome video that was presented to us
by some of the Critters that I think you'll also

01:29:41.182 --> 01:29:43.762
appreciate as well. So we'll go ahead roll that
and use the potty

01:29:43.762 --> 01:29:46.556
and we'll see you guys in a few minutes.

01:29:46.556 --> 01:29:55.728
[break]

01:39:54.334 --> 01:39:57.188
MATT: Welcome back. I assume we'll have a Liam
here in just a moment.

01:39:57.188 --> 01:39:59.274
ORION: He's just stealthing.

01:39:59.274 --> 01:40:02.846
WILL: He's stealthing. He rolled a 28 
and disappeared.

01:40:02.846 --> 01:40:12.617
WIL: I was talking Liam's ear off during the break
about how much I love the dynamic among the three

01:40:12.617 --> 01:40:20.186
of you, and commiserating about how you feel
really naked and exposed when your whole party

01:40:20.186 --> 01:40:26.285
isn't together. How weird that feels to not have
everybody together at the same time. I think I

01:40:26.285 --> 01:40:28.198
kept him from the bathroom.

01:40:28.198 --> 01:40:34.318
MATT: Oh, gotcha. That's okay. He'll arrive. When
he comes, we'll all awkwardly stare. Yeah. When he

01:40:34.318 --> 01:40:42.228
does. When he arrives we'll all just-- But in the
meantime, you managed to go back and--

01:40:42.228 --> 01:40:50.511
LIAM: Stealth. Disadvantage on my next five
attacks.

01:40:50.511 --> 01:40:52.599
(laughter)

01:40:52.599 --> 01:40:54.649
WILL: I love the awkward stare. It was great.

01:40:54.649 --> 01:40:59.336
WIL: He's actually a very generous DM if he does
that. I actually make my players roll damage when

01:40:59.336 --> 01:41:01.069
they upset me.

01:41:01.069 --> 01:41:03.161
MATT: Oh, that's good to know.

01:41:03.161 --> 01:41:06.680
WIL: Yeah, dude, d6 damage if you annoy the GM.

01:41:06.680 --> 01:41:14.059
MATT: Wrath of the gods comes down upon you. All
right, so you guys taken a few minutes to acquire

01:41:14.059 --> 01:41:22.214
outfits that seem a little more fitting as to the
establishment you're planning to go and enter.

01:41:22.295 --> 01:41:25.584
MARISHA: Guys, we should have aliases. Can we have
aliases?

01:41:25.584 --> 01:41:27.354
WIL: Yeah, I'll be Thorbir.

01:41:27.354 --> 01:41:29.937
WILL: I like it. It's easy to remember.

01:41:29.937 --> 01:41:38.232
MARISHA: Very easy. Oh, you know what, maybe I
could-- would it be weird if I'm Vex? That's

01:41:38.232 --> 01:41:40.651
weird, isn't it?

01:41:40.651 --> 01:41:42.945
LIAM: That's really weird.

01:41:42.945 --> 01:41:48.707
MARISHA: Okay. What's a good elven name? What's
something common in Elven? You were around this

01:41:48.707 --> 01:41:56.819
stuff. All of my people have weird tribal names.
What's good?

01:41:56.819 --> 01:42:01.595
LIAM: Elivr is nice. Coralin.

01:42:01.595 --> 01:42:05.509
MARISHA: Oh, Coralin. Do I look like a Coralin?

01:42:05.509 --> 01:42:07.300
WILL: What does a Coralin look like?

01:42:07.300 --> 01:42:10.861
ORION: She does that. Just agree.

01:42:10.861 --> 01:42:15.629
LIAM: I will be Scanlan Shorthalt.

01:42:15.629 --> 01:42:21.049
MARISHA: (stutters) What, you can be Scanlan, but
I couldn't be Vex?

01:42:21.049 --> 01:42:25.342
LIAM: No, you can't do that. I'm just saying 
it's weird.

01:42:25.342 --> 01:42:28.085
MARISHA: That's double standard, Vax. I'm just
saying.

01:42:28.085 --> 01:42:33.288
ORION: I think it's maybe because you're not his
sister and it would be weird because that's his

01:42:33.288 --> 01:42:34.517
sister's name.

01:42:34.517 --> 01:42:36.286
WILL: You have a sister?

01:42:36.286 --> 01:42:38.256
LIAM: I have a twin, yes.

01:42:38.256 --> 01:42:43.564
WILL: What does she look like? Oh.

01:42:43.564 --> 01:42:46.177
ORION: But she's a female.

01:42:46.177 --> 01:42:48.209
WILL: She sounds lovely.

01:42:48.209 --> 01:42:50.128
WIL: Humans, am I right?

01:42:50.128 --> 01:42:52.294
MARISHA: She's very nice.

01:42:52.294 --> 01:42:55.724
WILL: That's what they say about all the ugly
girls. "She's very nice."

01:42:59.604 --> 01:43:04.164
MARISHA: I feel like I'm learning so much from
you. Is that what they say?

01:43:04.164 --> 01:43:07.181
ORION: Life lessons, yes.

01:43:07.181 --> 01:43:09.495
WILL: Velvet Cabaret?

01:43:09.495 --> 01:43:12.242
LIAM: To the Cabaret.

01:43:12.242 --> 01:43:16.848
WIL: I presume that I'll play the role of your
guard.

01:43:16.848 --> 01:43:18.606
LIAM: Bodyguard, yes.

01:43:18.606 --> 01:43:24.520
WILL: What does that make me? How about your
valet? You'll need one if you're wealthy. Would

01:43:24.520 --> 01:43:25.933
you have a human, though?

01:43:25.933 --> 01:43:32.162
LIAM: Of course. Of course I'll have a human,
being elven.

01:43:32.162 --> 01:43:35.078
ORION: Are we on our way there now?

01:43:35.078 --> 01:43:40.175
LIAM: Yeah, we're walking and talking. And you're
changed into a gnome.

01:43:40.175 --> 01:43:42.786
ORION: Now I change. I change, because it only
lasts a certain amount of time.

01:43:42.786 --> 01:43:44.269
LIAM: Boy or girl?

01:43:44.269 --> 01:43:45.984
ORION: I'm a boy.

01:43:45.984 --> 01:43:49.791
WILL: So are you Lord Vax?

01:43:49.791 --> 01:43:53.259
LIAM: Lord Scanlan of the Shorthalts.

01:43:53.259 --> 01:43:58.953
WILL: Lord Scanlan, okay. Lord Scanlan of the--
I'm sorry, of the what?

01:43:58.953 --> 01:43:59.997
LIAM: Of the Shorthalts.

01:43:59.997 --> 01:44:03.194
WILL: Of the Shorthalts. Okay.

01:44:03.194 --> 01:44:06.806
LIAM: We have a cobbling empire. Shoes.

01:44:06.806 --> 01:44:13.401
WILL: The Shorthalts. Okay. Lord Scanlan of the
Shorthalts.

01:44:13.401 --> 01:44:19.717
LIAM: We cater mostly to halflings and gnomes.
Everyone, but specifically because they're so

01:44:19.717 --> 01:44:20.775
underserved.

01:44:20.775 --> 01:44:23.188
WILL: You have a gnome shoe empire?

01:44:23.188 --> 01:44:25.642
LIAM: Rolling in it, baby.

01:44:25.642 --> 01:44:29.381
WIL: Where's your empire, human?

01:44:29.381 --> 01:44:31.703
WILL: I have no empire. I'm his valet.

01:44:31.703 --> 01:44:34.361
LIAM: We're wonderful partners, dear.

01:44:34.361 --> 01:44:36.219
MARISHA: Am I your wife?

01:44:36.219 --> 01:44:40.834
LIAM: Do you want to be? Is that weird?

01:44:40.834 --> 01:44:44.055
MARISHA: No.

01:44:44.055 --> 01:44:46.813
ORION: I say it's equally-- no, it's fine.

01:44:46.813 --> 01:44:52.602
MARISHA: No, it's fine. Yeah, I can be your
wife. I can RP this. I mean I can pretend to be.

01:44:52.602 --> 01:44:58.663
Yeah. So Coralin Shorthalt.

01:44:58.663 --> 01:45:01.717
WIL: Thorbir is pulling on his beard and breathing
deeply.

01:45:01.717 --> 01:45:05.177
ORION: Now I cast Alter Self.

01:45:05.177 --> 01:45:09.527
MATT: All right. Cast and a flash of light. You
guys all pick up the very, very heavy smell of

01:45:09.527 --> 01:45:13.179
breakfast ale emanating from the deeply breathing,
angry dwarf.

01:45:13.179 --> 01:45:17.310
ORION: Wait, Vax. What was my role in this?

01:45:17.310 --> 01:45:21.664
LIAM: You're an advisor. A financial advisor.

01:45:21.664 --> 01:45:23.217
ORION: Financial advisor. Excellent.

01:45:23.217 --> 01:45:32.336
MATT: All right. You guys make your way to a
little bit further north this of this route, five

01:45:32.336 --> 01:45:36.015
or six blocks until you get the outskirts of the
Velvet Cabaret, which based on the description

01:45:36.015 --> 01:45:39.439
you've gotten from a few individuals you asked
around, very easy to find. The fancy house of

01:45:39.439 --> 01:45:46.353
entertainment. It is a two-story building of dark
cherry wood with strips of what looks to be black

01:45:46.353 --> 01:45:53.496
suede bolted in a pattern along the outside of it.
It stands out like a sore thumb against the rest

01:45:53.496 --> 01:46:03.196
of the architecture, but it looks a night club. It
looks very, very gaudy, but in a way that the

01:46:03.196 --> 01:46:08.582
garishness looks expensive, and so you can't
really fault it for looking the way it does.

01:46:08.582 --> 01:46:11.057
WIL: It looks like cruise ship goth club.

01:46:11.057 --> 01:46:13.170
MATT: I like that. I'll take that.

01:46:13.170 --> 01:46:15.753
WILL: Cruise ship goth club.

01:46:15.753 --> 01:46:16.921
WIL: That's a thing that exists.

01:46:16.921 --> 01:46:17.950
WILL: Really?!

01:46:17.950 --> 01:46:20.425
MATT: When are we going to this?

01:46:20.425 --> 01:46:25.665
WIL: Every year on the Jonathan Coulton Cruise, we
gather in the cruise ship goth club.

01:46:25.665 --> 01:46:27.265
WILL: Wow.

01:46:27.265 --> 01:46:28.870
MATT: JoCo Cruise.

01:46:28.870 --> 01:46:31.557
WILL: Too many jokes.

01:46:31.557 --> 01:46:40.506
MATT: I know. As you approach the front, you can
see that there are two bouncers established at the

01:46:40.506 --> 01:46:48.714
very front. To the left, you see a meaty male
dragonborn, bronze scale with painted face scars.

01:46:48.714 --> 01:46:53.397
He has a very, very intense look about him. He's
thicker. He's built like a barrel. He sits with

01:46:53.397 --> 01:46:58.513
his arms crossed, looking angrily out amongst the
rest of the folks outside. To the other side, you

01:46:58.513 --> 01:47:05.369
recognize a burly-looking female with short hair
and some facial tattoos. The Siren, who you saw

01:47:05.369 --> 01:47:11.149
battle in the Cauldron, apparently works as one of
the bouncers of the Velvet Cabaret.

01:47:11.149 --> 01:47:22.987
ORION: I approach right next to Vax, as we move
up. Scanlan. In Draconic I go, greetings and

01:47:22.987 --> 01:47:25.204
salutations, friend.

01:47:25.204 --> 01:47:33.362
MATT: He gives you a look of confusion for a
second and leans forward and the dragonborn looks

01:47:33.362 --> 01:47:41.375
very intently at you and says back in Draconic,
"Are you a member?"

01:47:41.375 --> 01:47:50.867
ORION: Not yet. We are new to this place. My
master here is seeking audience with his kind. We

01:47:50.999 --> 01:47:56.224
were guided to this place. This establishment has
a high reputation.

01:47:56.224 --> 01:48:00.841
We wish to inquire how to get inside.

01:48:00.841 --> 01:48:06.790
MATT: Looks over to the Siren. Siren glances back
and, "What's he saying?"

01:48:06.790 --> 01:48:13.250
And the dragonborn glances over. And he says out
loud in Common now, at this point, "He's saying

01:48:13.250 --> 01:48:18.618
"that they're looking to come in here and talk to
other elvish guys, I guess."

01:48:18.618 --> 01:48:24.402
ORION: Oh, not elvish, but more people of high
society. High society here.

01:48:24.402 --> 01:48:27.587
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

01:48:34.557 --> 01:48:36.406
ORION: 21.

01:48:36.412 --> 01:48:47.127
MATT: 21. He gives a glance over. "Well, if you're
not a member, you can acquire membership, but it

01:48:47.127 --> 01:48:49.747
"has to approved first by the owner."

01:48:49.747 --> 01:48:56.372
ORION: May we seek audience with him to ask or
apply, or however that goes about.

01:48:56.372 --> 01:49:00.528
MATT: "Let me get his assistant. Hold on just a
second. Siren."

01:49:00.528 --> 01:49:05.140
She gives a look. "I'll be right back." She rolls
up her sleeves

01:49:05.140 --> 01:49:07.672
and steps inside as the door opens.

01:49:07.672 --> 01:49:11.225
MARISHA: As I see her, I turn and face outward.

01:49:11.225 --> 01:49:14.157
WILL: You know her?

01:49:14.157 --> 01:49:15.967
MARISHA: No.

01:49:15.967 --> 01:49:17.168
WILL: Okay.

01:49:17.171 --> 01:49:22.828
MATT: As the door opens, you can already hear 
what sounds like soft harp music coming from the

01:49:22.828 --> 01:49:26.955
interior. And it's hard to actually look inside
because as you can see there are silks draped

01:49:26.955 --> 01:49:30.564
crossed over and in front of the entryway, as soon
as you step in.

01:49:30.564 --> 01:49:36.312
A few moments pass, eventually the Siren returns
and you are greeted at the doorway by a dwarf with

01:49:36.312 --> 01:49:45.850
very well-groomed facial hair. A beard that comes
to a fine point, has a little gold ring at the

01:49:45.850 --> 01:49:54.136
very bottom that kinks it at the bottom, this
little poof. With makeup on. Very rosy cheeks, and

01:49:54.136 --> 01:50:00.265
you can see there is eyeliner around his eyes.
Smile to his face. Wearing these long white robes,

01:50:00.265 --> 01:50:07.433
lots of jewelry. And the rest of his dark brown
hair is pulled into a dual ponytail that runs down

01:50:07.799 --> 01:50:13.792
to the middle of the back. Comes to door and
immediately says, "Gracious welcome to all of you.

01:50:13.792 --> 01:50:17.030
"I've been told that you're seeking possible
membership to our establishment."

01:50:17.030 --> 01:50:20.397
ORION: In Dwarvish I say, that's correct.

01:50:20.397 --> 01:50:28.360
MATT: "Well, fantastic, then. Don't leave possible
patrons outside." And looks off to the two

01:50:28.360 --> 01:50:34.095
bouncers and they grumble and step off to the
side. "Come in. Come in. Follow me." And he steps

01:50:34.095 --> 01:50:40.438
inside. As you guys walk in behind him,
immediately you're hit with the strong smell of

01:50:40.438 --> 01:50:50.348
exotic incense and the cooking of meat mingling
with that. It has this smell of everything good

01:50:50.348 --> 01:50:53.414
you've ever smelled mixed into one location.

01:50:53.414 --> 01:50:57.114
WILL: Love the smell of these places.

01:50:57.114 --> 01:51:03.932
MATT: The interior is fairly low-lit with what
looks like a series of faerie-fire lamps dangling

01:51:03.932 --> 01:51:09.890
in small lattice cages. So it has this light
purplish-pink glow to the general interior. There

01:51:09.890 --> 01:51:14.705
are no stools or chairs. There are tables that low
set and the floor is nearly covered with very,

01:51:14.705 --> 01:51:19.315
very expensive looking pillows. All the patrons
are currently sitting cross-legged or laying

01:51:19.315 --> 01:51:24.247
around the tables. And you can see the clientele
is very well dressed and very wealthy. There is

01:51:24.247 --> 01:51:29.139
laughter and conversation. There's definitely has
a very, very different air. It's like stepping

01:51:29.139 --> 01:51:33.211
into a whole different world from what you're used
to seeing in Vasselheim. And you get the feeling

01:51:33.211 --> 01:51:37.278
that whoever created this establishment definitely
created it to provide a very different experience

01:51:37.278 --> 01:51:40.735
for most people who work here, which means one, it
probably makes a really good killing to the small

01:51:40.735 --> 01:51:44.104
number of clientele, number two, it probably isn't
very well liked by the people who have been living

01:51:44.104 --> 01:51:50.034
here most their life. As you look around, too,
there are dice games being played, there are many

01:51:50.034 --> 01:51:58.342
gold pieces being stacked up on tables. It appears
that there's definitely a lively-- what's the word

01:51:58.342 --> 01:52:07.092
I'm looking for? My brain isn't working-- gambling
arrangement in this place. You notice that all the

01:52:07.092 --> 01:52:15.495
guards in the inside, the bouncers, are common
sell-swords. There's no unification to their

01:52:15.495 --> 01:52:18.639
adornments or any of their armor and stuff. There
are a few folks that are looking around, keeping

01:52:18.639 --> 01:52:23.647
the peace, arms crossed. They all definitely have
weapons visible. And they're just sitting there,

01:52:23.647 --> 01:52:26.813
guarding just like the bouncers were at front of
the place.

01:52:26.813 --> 01:52:28.703
WILL: How many dwarves?

01:52:28.703 --> 01:52:30.374
MATT: Just the one that let you inside.

01:52:30.374 --> 01:52:33.548
MARISHA: I reach over and I grab Vax's hand.

01:52:33.548 --> 01:52:39.517
LIAM: I fold her arm in and walk forward.

01:52:39.517 --> 01:52:40.527
MATT: All right.

01:52:40.527 --> 01:52:45.801
WILL: I think, as they move forward, I would like
to pull Thorbir aside and say, maybe since we're

01:52:45.801 --> 01:52:49.165
trying to get membership here, you should cover
your runes.

01:52:53.945 --> 01:52:55.435
WIL: Noted.

01:52:55.435 --> 01:52:57.336
WILL: Thank you.

01:52:57.336 --> 01:53:08.668
WIL: I'd like to make a perception check to size
up the guards around. Ten.

01:53:08.668 --> 01:53:12.558
MATT: Well, that's a step in the right direction.

01:53:12.558 --> 01:53:18.118
WIL: I rolled four times as good as I usually
roll.

01:53:18.118 --> 01:53:24.394
MATT: Looking about, they look armored. It's hard
to tell their skill level, based on the low light

01:53:24.394 --> 01:53:30.065
in here. They seem definitely keeping an eye out,
but you can tell they've been working here a while

01:53:30.065 --> 01:53:34.234
and they've grown comfortable. What you do notice,
though, is a lot of the servers that are walking

01:53:34.234 --> 01:53:42.037
around are young men and women dressed in very
fine silk robes or gowns. All have these iron

01:53:42.037 --> 01:53:47.704
bands around their neck, collars, that aren't
chained to anything. But it immediately gives you

01:53:47.704 --> 01:53:58.785
this mental image of slavery or some sort of
servitude. It does not appear that they are

01:53:58.785 --> 01:54:05.067
actually in some sort of servitude, but the
adornment they wear is almost trying to get across

01:54:05.067 --> 01:54:10.410
that atmosphere, as if that's part of what you're
paying for. It sickens you a little.

01:54:10.410 --> 01:54:18.172
WIL: I'm going to carry myself and I'm going to do
what I can to give off that I'm keeping an eye on

01:54:18.172 --> 01:54:25.418
this guy, that I'm the guy. That's how I'm trying
to carry myself.

01:54:25.418 --> 01:54:29.347
MATT: Okay. As you guys you have walked to the
center of this room now, the dwarf individual who

01:54:29.347 --> 01:54:37.244
let you in turns around and with a bit of a bow.
"I would to introduce myself. My name is Hosin. I

01:54:37.244 --> 01:54:43.598
"am the manager of this fine establishment, the
Velvet Cabaret. I'd like to welcome you..."

01:54:43.598 --> 01:54:46.406
LIAM: Scanlan of the Shorthalts.

01:54:46.406 --> 01:54:49.759
MATT: "Scanlan of the Shorthalts? Where do you
hail from? I've not heard of them."

01:54:49.759 --> 01:54:54.637
LIAM: We come from Emon. I sell shoes. We sell
shoes.

01:54:54.637 --> 01:54:57.104
MARISHA: Yes, Coralin Shorthalt.

01:54:57.104 --> 01:54:58.598
MATT: "Coralin Shorthalt."

01:54:58.598 --> 01:54:59.991
MARISHA: Yes, pleasure.

01:54:59.991 --> 01:55:04.650
MATT: "Very well. Well, you have interest in
membership you say?"

01:55:04.650 --> 01:55:12.263
LIAM: We do. We're hoping to sample the atmosphere
here. Is there entertainment? We heard there was

01:55:12.263 --> 01:55:14.317
great entertainment.

01:55:14.317 --> 01:55:18.019
MATT: "Oh yes, quite entertainment here at certain
hours, if you like. For now, we have more an

01:55:18.019 --> 01:55:21.148
"atmospheric presentation." And he looks over, and
you can you see that there is small stage off to

01:55:21.148 --> 01:55:28.323
the corner. There sits a very beautiful elven
woman, dressed in a gold gown that is sleeveless

01:55:28.323 --> 01:55:32.806
and hugs to her form very well. You can see that
it shimmers and little bit of purple fairy light

01:55:32.806 --> 01:55:36.934
that is hanging above her. And she just this
gorgeous-looking silver harp in front of her.

01:55:36.934 --> 01:55:40.691
She's just plucking away. Her eyes are closed,
like she's just caught in the moment. And there's

01:55:40.691 --> 01:55:45.531
group of people that are sitting around her
chatting softly, not to be overbearing to the

01:55:45.531 --> 01:55:48.258
music, but to just be around that atmosphere.

01:55:48.258 --> 01:55:54.139
ORION: Your wonderful employees mentioned
membership. We'd like to acquire that as well, I

01:55:54.139 --> 01:55:56.717
assume, as well.

01:55:56.717 --> 01:55:59.007
MATT: You're saying this to Hosin?

01:55:59.007 --> 01:56:01.996
LIAM: This is Thorlaxalux, my financial advisor.

01:56:01.996 --> 01:56:06.299
ORION: Thorlaxalux, at your service. I bow
gracefully.

01:56:06.299 --> 01:56:09.229
MATT: Make a persuasion roll. No, deception roll.
Deception roll.

01:56:09.229 --> 01:56:12.795
ORION: What is that? 16?

01:56:12.795 --> 01:56:19.944
MATT: 16? All right. "The pleasure is mine. And
it's not often that come across elves that have

01:56:19.944 --> 01:56:21.745
taken the time to learn the tongue of my folk."

01:56:21.745 --> 01:56:24.228
ORION: I know many languages.

01:56:24.228 --> 01:56:30.530
MARISHA: He's very well traveled. Very well
cultured. That's part why we hired him.

01:56:30.530 --> 01:56:35.474
ORION: I was a bit of a shut-in as a child. All I
had were books on languages to read and whatnot,

01:56:35.474 --> 01:56:37.445
and adventures and what have you.

01:56:37.445 --> 01:56:42.904
MATT: "Well, if you are seeking membership, you
should probably speak with our patron, the owner

01:56:42.904 --> 01:56:49.411
"of this establishment. He's currently in a
meeting, I believe, but step with me for a

01:56:49.411 --> 01:56:52.571
"moment." And he leads you to go to the other side
of the room. And you know, all these draped orange

01:56:52.571 --> 01:56:59.149
and gold silks that are constantly getting in your
way as you push through. Leads you into a doorway

01:56:59.149 --> 01:57:04.702
that is covered in these silks. You push into the
hallway to the right and left. There's a door

01:57:04.702 --> 01:57:07.564
across the way, and two doors down the left. And
the door at the very end is a really

01:57:07.564 --> 01:57:15.009
ornate-looking door with a series of locks that
currently unlocked. Hosin walks up to it and

01:57:15.009 --> 01:57:21.913
knocks gently onto it, takes a listen. "Ah, it
appears that he will be available in just a

01:57:21.913 --> 01:57:25.212
"moment, if you'd like to sit tight, and you're
more than welcome to speak."

01:57:25.212 --> 01:57:35.503
MARISHA: Question, Hosin. While we wait, do you
happen to have any wine or ale? Just while we

01:57:35.503 --> 01:57:37.498
wait. It's been such a long travel.

01:57:37.498 --> 01:57:39.383
MATT: "But of course."

01:57:39.383 --> 01:57:40.780
MARISHA: Thank you. You're so kind.

01:57:40.780 --> 01:57:46.620
MATT: He claps his hands, and you can see one of
the servants that you saw walking with a small

01:57:46.620 --> 01:57:49.792
tray enters from the side of the hallway. "Yes?"

01:57:49.792 --> 01:57:56.933
Hosin turns. "The finest wine we have available 
for the elven lass right here." The servant

01:57:56.933 --> 01:58:04.292
immediately darts off, averting the eyes. A moment
passes. Returns with three glasses of wine,

01:58:04.292 --> 01:58:09.655
looking over you two. Hands one to each of you.
And the servant, still averting his gaze from the

01:58:09.655 --> 01:58:14.002
guests, smiles, gives a little curtsy, and then
darts back into the main room.

01:58:14.002 --> 01:58:17.459
MARISHA: Cheers. Cling.

01:58:17.459 --> 01:58:21.704
LIAM: I cling and hand my glass to Thorbir.

01:58:27.344 --> 01:58:30.680
MARISHA: I take a sip of mine. It's very good.

01:58:30.680 --> 01:58:35.546
WIL: All right. I'm sipping to keep up the charade, 
but I'm not happy about it.

01:58:40.036 --> 01:58:44.704
MATT: It's definitely an elvish blend, which is
generally too sweet for your tastes, but for what

01:58:44.704 --> 01:58:48.919
you were expecting, it's not too bad. Its
serviceable. Nowhere near strong enough to really

01:58:48.919 --> 01:58:51.931
do anything, but it's not water.

01:58:51.931 --> 01:58:57.345
WIL: So as I hand it back to you, I sort of
mutter, wine.

01:58:57.345 --> 01:59:03.505
(laughter)

01:59:03.505 --> 01:59:07.185
WIL: Giant dwarven air quotes.

01:59:07.185 --> 01:59:13.583
MATT: The doorway at the end of the hallway opens
up suddenly, and as it does, a servant walks out

01:59:13.583 --> 01:59:19.354
holding a tray that contains a bunch of
partially-eaten fruits and what looks the outer

01:59:19.354 --> 01:59:27.838
gristle of some sort of cooked meat, and looks at
you all awkwardly and steps past and disappears

01:59:27.838 --> 01:59:35.665
into the other room. You hear a voice come down
the hallway. "Enter! I ask you all to enter. You

01:59:35.665 --> 01:59:43.364
"are to meet me. Please, come, sit, be comfortable.
Welcome to the Velvet Cabaret."

01:59:43.364 --> 01:59:46.942
LIAM: Look to Thorbir and then look in the room.

01:59:50.732 --> 01:59:52.787
WIL: I step into the room.

01:59:52.787 --> 02:00:00.039
MATT: As you enter, Hosin lowers his head and
offers his arms at the rest of you to acquiesce.

02:00:00.039 --> 02:00:08.074
Stepping into the room, you see-- once again, a
room that has a square or rectangular table in the

02:00:08.074 --> 02:00:14.577
center that has a series of small platters on it
with bits of previously devoured meal, and there

02:00:14.577 --> 02:00:21.321
are three small cushions on the ground that you
see would act as some sort of sitting arrangement.

02:00:21.321 --> 02:00:26.887
The opposite side of the room has three large
purple cushions on which there are two women, also

02:00:26.887 --> 02:00:31.021
servants, that are just lying back comfortably,
just resting, and in the center, you see a man,

02:00:31.021 --> 02:00:40.126
very dark complexion, ratty looking, crimped dark
hair, very well-trimmed beard and mustache

02:00:40.126 --> 02:00:49.077
ensemble, and long black and gold robes. Very,
very long sleeves and jewelry adorning every ounce

02:00:49.077 --> 02:00:52.934
of his hands, his fingers, you can barely see the
actual skin beneath, there is just so much jewelry

02:00:52.934 --> 02:00:58.650
adorning him. He looks up smiling with his elbows
near the edge of the table. "Have a seat. We are

02:00:58.650 --> 02:01:04.261
"to talk, yes? Introduce yourselves. Guests are
always welcome, but I wish to know who it is that

02:01:04.261 --> 02:01:05.952
"I am guesting for."

02:01:05.952 --> 02:01:16.484
LIAM: I seat Coralin and have a seat myself. And
pretending to check out the women in the room, I

02:01:16.484 --> 02:01:21.627
make a perception check. And that is a 16.

02:01:21.627 --> 02:01:26.080
MATT: All right, what are trying to see?

02:01:26.080 --> 02:01:31.031
LIAM: Oh, if anything sets off my alarm
bells.

02:01:31.031 --> 02:01:36.010
MATT: They seem to be lounging. And there isn't
like fear in their eyes or that they are being

02:01:36.010 --> 02:01:39.532
mistreated per se. Almost like they're here for
atmosphere.

02:01:39.532 --> 02:01:40.758
LIAM: And the room itself?

02:01:40.758 --> 02:01:46.542
MATT: The room itself-- Most of the walls have
like a velvety texture to them. All the wood has

02:01:46.542 --> 02:01:53.507
been covered with some sort of material that has a
comfortable almost-- Everything feels like it's a

02:01:53.507 --> 02:01:59.774
lounging bedroom. And that's the aesthetic of a
lot of the interior of this location. You cannot

02:01:59.774 --> 02:02:04.681
quite see the source of the light in the room. It
almost feels like there's an indirect lighting

02:02:04.681 --> 02:02:08.846
accoutrement across the ceiling. Whatever the
source of lighting is, it's being spread across

02:02:08.846 --> 02:02:17.421
the top. It gives this sort of dark intimate feel
to this current room at least. As he gestures out

02:02:17.421 --> 02:02:22.846
to the rest of you to sit. "I fear there are only
three seats, but I assume that your accompaniment

02:02:22.846 --> 02:02:31.738
"are accustomed to standing, anyway. So do not
worry. Very good. Now you say you come for

02:02:31.738 --> 02:02:36.420
"membership. Membership does not come cheap.
Membership does not come to anyone. We have

02:02:36.420 --> 02:02:40.519
"a certain level of clientele we wish to keep, because
in keeping this it is easy enough for us to

02:02:40.519 --> 02:02:46.282
"consider it very-- how do I say?-- exquisite."

02:02:46.282 --> 02:02:50.993
MARISHA: I'm sorry, before we go on, what was your
name? I don't believe I caught it.

02:02:50.993 --> 02:02:53.277
MATT: "I did not catch your name either."

02:02:53.277 --> 02:02:56.129
MARISHA: Oh, I'm sorry, I am Coralin. Coralin
Shorthalt.

02:02:56.129 --> 02:02:57.092
MATT: "Coralin Shorthalt."

02:02:57.092 --> 02:02:58.803
MARISHA: Of the Emon Shorthalts.

02:02:58.948 --> 02:03:02.805
MATT: Takes your hand and leans forward, and gives
you this ginger kiss to edge of your fingers.

02:03:02.805 --> 02:03:13.566
Yeah, there is a slimy-ish presence, but not too
aggressive. Just a very well-trained type of

02:03:13.566 --> 02:03:15.290
dealing with guests.

02:03:15.290 --> 02:03:19.532
MARISHA: I subversively wipe it on my robes.

02:03:19.532 --> 02:03:26.909
MATT: "My name is Vince Cyinnor. And I am the
owner of this house of joy and pleasure."

02:03:26.909 --> 02:03:36.030
LIAM: I'm the lucky man who married her. My name
is Scanlan of the Shorthalts. We're in from Emon,

02:03:36.030 --> 02:03:46.007
and reputation of this establishment is well known
within all parts of the walls. We're looking to

02:03:46.007 --> 02:03:50.732
possibly become members here. We hear the
entertainment is top-notch, and we hear that

02:03:50.732 --> 02:04:04.009
business happens within these walls. But I'm not
convinced. I'm hoping to stay for an hour to see

02:04:04.009 --> 02:04:11.680
what you have to offer. When I find I like a
place, I stay for a long time and leave a lot of

02:04:11.680 --> 02:04:16.053
money. I'd just like a little taste.

02:04:16.053 --> 02:04:19.496
MATT: Make a deception check.

02:04:19.638 --> 02:04:30.536
LIAM: Using my last Luck of the day. That's
better. 15.

02:04:30.536 --> 02:04:44.343
MATT: 15. "Hosin, if you don't mind." And the door
closes behind you guys. "Well, Scanlan Shorthalt.

02:04:44.343 --> 02:04:54.966
"What, may I ask, business do you run that gives
you the liquid assets to think that you can walk

02:04:54.966 --> 02:05:01.028
"and rub shoulders among such astute clientele? You
are well-dressed, I see, and well-versed in

02:05:01.028 --> 02:05:10.445
"conversation. But have not heard of you before and
I have very acute ears for people of such heritage

02:05:10.445 --> 02:05:11.841
"in this city."

02:05:11.841 --> 02:05:20.924
LIAM: We hail from Emon. We're not very flashy. We
certainly don't do much in public in Emon. I

02:05:20.924 --> 02:05:25.419
prefer to make my money and enjoy my money and I
don't believe in ostentation.

02:05:25.419 --> 02:05:35.693
MATT: "Why have you come to this establishment? I
am made of ostentation, for I do not fear what

02:05:35.693 --> 02:05:39.725
"people judge or think here. Do what you like."

02:05:39.725 --> 02:05:45.551
LIAM: Don't get me wrong. I enjoy the form of a
beautiful woman as much as the next man.

02:05:45.551 --> 02:05:49.830
MATT: "Why limit yourself?"

02:05:49.830 --> 02:05:52.925
LIAM: Who said I do?

02:05:52.925 --> 02:05:57.246
MATT: "Even this one here, while his appearance
may be rough, I'm certain that under certain

02:05:57.246 --> 02:06:04.615
"circumstances he could be persuaded to prove his
weight in more than gold and weaponry."

02:06:04.615 --> 02:06:10.489
MARISHA: Mr. Cyinnor, I think it is best that you
do not make presumptions

02:06:10.489 --> 02:06:14.165
on our relationship and dealings.

02:06:14.165 --> 02:06:24.444
LIAM: My wife and I are businessmen. And what we
hear is that this is where business happens.

02:06:24.444 --> 02:06:30.349
MATT: "Business does happen here, yes. Quite a bit
of interesting business."

02:06:30.349 --> 02:06:35.575
MARISHA: And we are very interested in all of
those interesting businesses.

02:06:35.575 --> 02:06:43.569
MATT: "From what I hear, as my assistant has told me,
your business is shoes. Tell me, why would the

02:06:43.569 --> 02:06:50.127
"business of shoes require such an ostentatious
location for business?"

02:06:50.127 --> 02:06:56.182
LIAM: The shoes are the public face, but the well
runs deep.

02:06:56.182 --> 02:07:05.399
MATT: "We get to the meat of the matter, eh? So,
shoes is but an appearance. What is your business

02:07:05.399 --> 02:07:08.568
"aside from cobbling, Mr. Shorthalt?"

02:07:08.568 --> 02:07:23.355
LIAM: I know my way around poison, and I hear you
have the rarest of breeds here. I have come to

02:07:23.355 --> 02:07:28.670
spend some money to satisfy my clients.

02:07:28.670 --> 02:07:34.755
MATT: Make a deception check.

02:07:34.755 --> 02:07:36.086
LIAM: 15 again.

02:07:36.086 --> 02:07:37.209
MATT: What was it?

02:07:37.209 --> 02:07:38.773
LIAM: 15 again.

02:07:38.773 --> 02:07:51.937
MATT: "Poisons? So you supply to what?
King-killers? Supply to sell-swords? You apply

02:07:51.937 --> 02:08:00.009
"them to your own weapons? You realize this city is
very, very tight-knit when it comes to these sorts of

02:08:00.009 --> 02:08:04.685
"industries. Although I know you would think possibly
to find it here, I guarantee you what we deal with

02:08:04.864 --> 02:08:07.752
"here has nothing to do with slitting of throats."

02:08:07.752 --> 02:08:14.844
LIAM: I'm not looking to sell. I'm looking to
buy.

02:08:14.844 --> 02:08:25.015
MATT: "I will tell you one thing that I am interested
in buying. I'm interested in buying information.

02:08:25.015 --> 02:08:33.561
"I'm interested in buying loyalty. I'm interested
in buying trust. Since you've walked into this

02:08:33.561 --> 02:08:39.575
"room, there has been an air of something not right
about you. And through this conversation, I have

02:08:39.575 --> 02:08:46.645
"come to believe that perhaps you're not telling me
the truth. Now, I will ask of you this moment,

02:08:46.645 --> 02:08:54.925
"whoever you may be, Shorthalt or not, but this
entire facility is very well paid to make sure

02:08:54.925 --> 02:09:00.918
"that should you try anything funny, you won't get
but two steps before the heads leave your

02:09:00.918 --> 02:09:07.535
"shoulders. So let's be frank here. Who are you?
Why are you here?"

02:09:07.535 --> 02:09:17.537
MARISHA: Mr. Vince, let's not play coy. I am sure
you have dealt with many a powerful client in

02:09:17.537 --> 02:09:22.795
your day. And I am sure that it is not unfamiliar
to you that many powerful clients

02:09:22.795 --> 02:09:27.974
have many deep secrets.

02:09:27.974 --> 02:09:30.927
ORION: As she finishes that, I dispel Alter Self.

02:09:30.927 --> 02:09:37.774
MATT: Okay. As your actual dragonborn appearance
restores itself, he sits back.

02:09:37.774 --> 02:09:44.724
ORION: My apologies. I am Tiberius Stormwind--
yes, wind.

02:09:44.724 --> 02:09:46.535
WILL: I can never get it right.

02:09:46.535 --> 02:09:54.872
ORION: I merely dispelled this to show you that
earning your trust is in our best interests. I do

02:09:54.872 --> 02:09:56.600
not wish to deceive.

02:09:56.600 --> 02:10:00.039
MATT: "Then perhaps you should have walked in this
form when you first arrived."

02:10:00.039 --> 02:10:04.550
ORION: Many people don't take kindly to a red
dragonborn by the way. I just thought it was best.

02:10:04.550 --> 02:10:10.984
We're in a new town and it was standard protocol
whenever we visit a new town. My apologies.

02:10:10.984 --> 02:10:17.477
MATT: "Well, one person has come clean. What about
this one? What is your business here?"

02:10:17.477 --> 02:10:23.024
WILL: My business here is the same as theirs.
We're here, in the long run, to help you.

02:10:23.024 --> 02:10:26.619
MATT: "What is to help me? You have not told me
what your business is."

02:10:26.619 --> 02:10:32.947
LIAM: We're here to stop a murderer.

02:10:32.947 --> 02:10:35.187
MATT: "Explain."

02:10:35.187 --> 02:10:44.786
LIAM: Bodies have been showing up outside this
building. Multiple bodies. We're not going to get

02:10:44.786 --> 02:10:49.407
into the details, but we've been sent here to stop
that from happening any further.

02:10:49.407 --> 02:10:51.922
ORION: We're fairly sure you know of this.

02:10:51.922 --> 02:10:55.143
LIAM: Look at this guy. Does he look like he's
fucking around?

02:10:55.143 --> 02:11:00.656
WIL: He winks at him.

02:11:00.656 --> 02:11:06.470
MATT: The force of the wink itself is intense
enough to the point where he physically shudders

02:11:06.470 --> 02:11:09.170
and leans back a few inches.

02:11:09.170 --> 02:11:16.375
LIAM: Now, you must be aware of this problem.
Can't be a surprise to you. People are starting to

02:11:16.375 --> 02:11:21.589
take notice in this city. This was inevitable.

02:11:21.589 --> 02:11:25.623
WILL: Do you still have Lord Tyrell's
possessions?

02:11:25.623 --> 02:11:33.736
MATT: "This is about Lord Tyrell? We do have his
possessions. They have been investigated. Our

02:11:33.736 --> 02:11:38.571
"establishment has already been investigated. The
Bastions were very thorough, and we have been

02:11:38.571 --> 02:11:41.299
"found absolved of any sort of involvement."

02:11:41.299 --> 02:11:47.699
MARISHA: We are not Bastions. And we are not here
to accuse. And we are not here to investigate your

02:11:47.699 --> 02:11:49.146
establishment.

02:11:49.146 --> 02:11:55.334
MATT: "Interesting. You come in here and lie. It
seems to me exactly what you're doing. Now, are

02:11:55.334 --> 02:11:58.499
"you coming to ask questions? To see what
involvement we have? Answers? We've already told

02:11:58.499 --> 02:12:01.133
"everything to anyone else. We have no involvement.
I don't know what you're talking about. This is

02:12:01.133 --> 02:12:03.511
"ridiculous. And I may have to ask you to leave."

02:12:03.511 --> 02:12:05.490
MARISHA: He's shutting down. Someone do something
quick.

02:12:05.490 --> 02:12:08.421
LIAM: Insight check, insight check. Balls.

02:12:08.421 --> 02:12:11.645
WIL: I will also make an insight check.

02:12:11.645 --> 02:12:13.880
MARISHA: Can I do that, as well?

02:12:13.880 --> 02:12:16.221
(laughter)

02:12:16.221 --> 02:12:22.464
MATT: What did you get?

02:12:22.464 --> 02:12:25.118
MARISHA: We're all going to die.

02:12:25.118 --> 02:12:27.648
LIAM: That makes my ten look titanic.

02:12:27.648 --> 02:12:31.784
WIL: I'm trying to make you look good. It's what
Thorbir does.

02:12:31.784 --> 02:12:34.040
MARISHA: 19.

02:12:34.040 --> 02:12:35.919
WIL: I rolled a two.

02:12:35.919 --> 02:12:37.832
WILL: You're going up.

02:12:37.832 --> 02:12:43.151
MATT: It's not impressive. That's mythic.

02:12:43.151 --> 02:12:45.605
WIL: Statistically unlikely.

02:12:45.605 --> 02:12:47.968
WILL: That's the thing. You're beating math.

02:12:47.968 --> 02:12:54.133
WIL: I've been beating math for 20 years. I'm very
good.

02:12:54.133 --> 02:12:57.652
MATT: Yeah. You're the singularity that ruins the
universe.

02:12:57.652 --> 02:13:03.002
WIL: Somewhere in the world there's a person who
never rolls under 17. And I was placed on this

02:13:03.002 --> 02:13:12.141
planet to balance the math to save you all. To
prevent the center of the planet from collapsing

02:13:12.141 --> 02:13:15.099
and taking us all with it. You're welcome.

02:13:15.099 --> 02:13:18.809
LIAM: She's in New Zealand. The other side of the
Earth.

02:13:18.809 --> 02:13:24.324
MATT: All right. So, as you're all taking this
moment to yourself. It's hard to read. It seems

02:13:24.324 --> 02:13:29.560
like he's very thorough and offended by this
circumstance. You glean that there is a

02:13:29.560 --> 02:13:37.287
nervousness, and there are droplets of sweat
across his brow. And his brusqeness does show a

02:13:37.287 --> 02:13:38.918
bit of fear in his eyes.

02:13:38.918 --> 02:13:46.650
MARISHA: About this time, I go (fwoosh) and I cast my
wind spell. And I slam the doors behind us. And I

02:13:46.854 --> 02:13:52.430
slam the shutters. And turn out all the lights.
Did you say there was candlelight? Or did you say

02:13:52.430 --> 02:13:54.065
there was weird indirect lighting.

02:13:54.065 --> 02:13:57.131
MATT: Yeah, indirect lighting. You don't quite
know where the source is coming from. The door was

02:13:57.131 --> 02:14:03.734
already closed behind you. Hosin closed it. But as
the wind comes out, all the silks blow against the

02:14:03.734 --> 02:14:10.222
wall. Pillows are lobbed to the sides. Both of the
women in there (yelps) and pull back against walls,

02:14:10.340 --> 02:14:15.343
trying to keep out of the circumstance. And you
can see Vince has begun to stand up and his hair

02:14:15.343 --> 02:14:17.849
blown back. "What is the meaning of this?"

02:14:17.849 --> 02:14:25.356
MARISHA: Now. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to do that.
I sometimes get a little out of control. But

02:14:25.356 --> 02:14:28.630
remain calm! All right?! Jesus! Remain calm!

02:14:28.630 --> 02:14:30.005
ORION: You calm down.

02:14:30.005 --> 02:14:32.308
MARISHA: I'm sorry! I'm trying to remain calm,
too!

02:14:32.308 --> 02:14:33.919
WILL: Doing a great job.

02:14:33.919 --> 02:14:37.442
MARISHA: Thank you! Okay.

02:14:37.442 --> 02:14:39.262
MATT: Persuasion check.

02:14:39.262 --> 02:14:40.607
MARISHA: Damn it.

02:14:40.607 --> 02:14:43.188
LIAM: Who's in this room? It's the women--

02:14:43.188 --> 02:14:51.244
MATT: It's the women and Vince. Hosin closed the
door and left in the hallway.

02:14:51.244 --> 02:14:52.928
LIAM: Vince is the--

02:14:52.928 --> 02:14:53.940
MATT: Owner.

02:14:53.940 --> 02:14:55.020
LIAM: But is he human?

02:14:55.020 --> 02:14:56.135
MATT: He's human.

02:14:56.135 --> 02:14:59.258
ORION: I'm going to approach him and I'm going to
cast Mage Hand. I'm going to have it float right up

02:14:59.258 --> 02:15:05.101
in front of me. I'm like, now, you better start
cooperating, because it seems to me that you're

02:15:05.101 --> 02:15:10.269
getting very nervous. And we don't want to do
anything. Nor do we want to leave. All we want is

02:15:10.269 --> 02:15:17.093
information. I guess we want to know what you want
to know, too. We want a lot of information. So

02:15:17.093 --> 02:15:19.835
start talking and stop acting like a fool.

02:15:19.835 --> 02:15:21.966
MATT: Make an intimidation check.

02:15:21.966 --> 02:15:27.110
LIAM: He's sometimes hard to follow, but you don't
want to fuck with him.

02:15:27.110 --> 02:15:28.441
ORION: 15.

02:15:28.441 --> 02:15:33.095
MATT: 15? As you do this, between you standing,
he's in the process of standing up, and he was

02:15:33.095 --> 02:15:39.068
reaching for something under one of the cushions.
As you do that, he glances about the room, looks

02:15:39.068 --> 02:15:42.963
over to you specifically, and back to the
dragonborn, the dwarf.

02:15:42.963 --> 02:15:46.778
MARISHA: And I say, and whatever weapon you were
about to brandish,

02:15:46.778 --> 02:15:50.388
you'd best wise to leave it be.

02:15:50.388 --> 02:15:57.579
MATT: "You realize, you may have just alerted
pretty much the entirety of my guard to this

02:15:57.579 --> 02:16:00.265
"establishment. They'll be descending on this room
soon."

02:16:00.265 --> 02:16:03.448
MARISHA: And you realize that this is only because
of your doing?

02:16:03.448 --> 02:16:06.413
MATT: He sits down on the cushion again.

02:16:06.413 --> 02:16:14.984
WIL: And Thorbir looks at him and goes, okay. And
pulls his greataxe out and leans on his greataxe.

02:16:14.984 --> 02:16:17.714
ORION: I disperse the magic hand.

02:16:17.714 --> 02:16:27.861
MARISHA: I say, now. Our quarrel is not with you.
We are not with the guard.

02:16:27.861 --> 02:16:29.757
We are not with the Bastions.

02:16:29.757 --> 02:16:31.508
ORION: More calm.

02:16:31.508 --> 02:16:33.611
WILL: Yes, still doing a great job with the calm,
there.

02:16:33.611 --> 02:16:42.464
MARISHA: I'm trying. I'm sorry. I get emotional.
I'm trying to remain calm, here. Okay?

02:16:42.464 --> 02:16:44.367
MATT: "What do you wish to know?"

02:16:44.367 --> 02:16:48.279
WILL: Once again, do you still have Lord Tyrell's
possessions?

02:16:48.279 --> 02:16:53.074
MATT: "His possessions are not under my keeping,
no."

02:16:53.074 --> 02:16:56.574
ORION: There we go. Thank you. Where are they?

02:16:56.574 --> 02:16:58.715
MATT: "I have no idea."

02:16:58.715 --> 02:17:00.235
WILL: I want to do a perception check.

02:17:00.235 --> 02:17:01.283
MATT: This would be insight, yeah.

02:17:01.283 --> 02:17:06.541
WILL: Insight check. Nice, where are we? Ooh, wow.
26.

02:17:06.541 --> 02:17:07.779
MATT: 26.

02:17:07.779 --> 02:17:09.229
WIL: What's that like?

02:17:09.229 --> 02:17:13.844
WILL: That's 29 of your rolls, strangely enough.

02:17:13.844 --> 02:17:20.616
(laughter)

02:17:20.616 --> 02:17:27.222
MATT: Looking at you tense. He's fumbling lie
after lie right now.

02:17:27.381 --> 02:17:30.266
WILL: It's just, you could easily tell.

02:17:30.266 --> 02:17:35.316
MATT: Yeah. For you especially, all the signs are
there, the quivering to his voice, his eyes

02:17:35.316 --> 02:17:38.391
darting from person to person. He's still
covering.

02:17:38.391 --> 02:17:43.401
WILL: Okay, you're sitting in a room now with a
whole bunch of people that want to hurt you. So

02:17:43.401 --> 02:17:49.183
it's obvious that you're lying. What do you know,
or this guy and this guy

02:17:49.183 --> 02:17:51.398
are going to dragon and axe you.

02:17:51.398 --> 02:18:02.493
MATT: "Look, what happened was unfortunate. There
are things beyond your understanding or control

02:18:02.493 --> 02:18:04.244
"involved here."

02:18:04.244 --> 02:18:06.884
WIL: Oh, I don't know, we can understand a lot.

02:18:06.884 --> 02:18:11.813
ORION: We fought a beholder before.

02:18:11.813 --> 02:18:17.197
MARISHA: Do not take us for fools who just walked
in here without a clue.

02:18:17.197 --> 02:18:23.083
LIAM: I walk forward, I pull out Dagger of Venom
and I drop a little bead of black down the blade

02:18:23.083 --> 02:18:32.247
and I hold it just about a centimeter under his
neck. I've all run out of patience, friend. We're

02:18:32.247 --> 02:18:38.219
here to help this city and you're going to help
us. Talk.

02:18:38.219 --> 02:18:41.521
MATT: Make an intimidation check with advantage
because of this whole setup here.

02:18:41.521 --> 02:18:45.046
MARISHA: Dear god, so many. Come on.

02:18:45.046 --> 02:18:47.771
LIAM: 20.

02:18:47.771 --> 02:18:52.580
MATT: "They'll kill me if I say anything."

02:18:52.580 --> 02:18:54.948
WILL: We're going to kill you now.

02:18:54.948 --> 02:18:56.666
LIAM: Now or later, friend.

02:18:56.666 --> 02:18:59.365
ORION: And we could protect you from them. Or it.

02:18:59.365 --> 02:19:09.003
MATT: "This establishment. I am not the owner. I
am a figurehead. Something else currently pulls

02:19:09.003 --> 02:19:10.910
"the strings from behind."

02:19:10.910 --> 02:19:12.772
MARISHA: Something else?

02:19:12.772 --> 02:19:14.461
ORION: As we said, it.

02:19:14.461 --> 02:19:21.137
MATT: And he looks off, past you, just over your
shoulder.

02:19:21.137 --> 02:19:22.503
LIAM: Perception check.

02:19:22.503 --> 02:19:24.180
MARISHA: Oh, son of a bitch.

02:19:24.180 --> 02:19:27.571
LIAM: 23.

02:19:27.571 --> 02:19:32.382
MATT: You glance over your shoulder briefly and at
this point you can see the door is partially ajar,

02:19:32.382 --> 02:19:38.385
and you can see in what little light there is a
dwarven face staring through the passage that then

02:19:38.385 --> 02:19:41.377
slams the door shut quickly and you hear
footsteps.

02:19:41.377 --> 02:19:43.089
MARISHA and WILL: Was that Hosin?

02:19:43.089 --> 02:19:44.618
MATT: That was Hosin, yeah.

02:19:44.618 --> 02:19:46.333
MARISHA: Fucking Hosin.

02:19:46.333 --> 02:19:48.357
WILL: Thanks a lot, hoser!

02:19:48.357 --> 02:19:55.605
MATT: He's shaking his head now, the blade there,
as you hear the feet running off now.

02:19:55.605 --> 02:20:03.806
MARISHA: I'm going-- something tiny and fast.
What's tiny and fast?

02:20:03.806 --> 02:20:06.183
LIAM: Mouse, rat.

02:20:06.183 --> 02:20:11.407
MARISHA: I'm going rat, and I'm going after
Hosin.

02:20:11.407 --> 02:20:18.149
MATT: All right. You guys watch as Keyleth all of
a sudden grasps the side of her armor and then her

02:20:18.149 --> 02:20:21.364
form shrinks down to a tiny rat, then darts
underneath.

02:20:21.364 --> 02:20:25.649
LIAM: I'm going to bap this guy in the head. I'm
going to just flip the blade and strike him across

02:20:25.649 --> 02:20:27.386
the forehead.

02:20:27.386 --> 02:20:32.612
ORION: As I see her do this, I open the scroll of
Polymorph. I do Polymorph on myself, and I turn

02:20:32.612 --> 02:20:35.580
myself into a gadfly. And follow.

02:20:35.580 --> 02:20:40.349
MATT: Okay. The scroll is consumed and gone. You
turn into a fly and follow, as well. Two of your

02:20:40.349 --> 02:20:42.935
party members just shrunk and vanished and went
off as creatures.

02:20:42.935 --> 02:20:44.915
You, go ahead and roll for an attack.

02:20:44.915 --> 02:20:49.843
LIAM: Okay, so on a surprise, it's advantage. So
19's pretty good. I'll take the 19

02:20:49.843 --> 02:20:54.787
over the two. So that's 19 plus-- 30.

02:20:54.909 --> 02:20:58.045
MATT: That hits, go ahead and roll sneak attack
damage on that.

02:20:58.045 --> 02:21:03.164
LIAM: Okay, sneak attack damage. Is this a
surprise because he didn't know it was coming?

02:21:03.164 --> 02:21:04.469
MATT: Yes, it is.

02:21:04.469 --> 02:21:11.265
LIAM: It is? So because of my assassinate feat,
then this is a critical hit. So just the sneak

02:21:11.265 --> 02:21:20.912
attack damage? Okay, four, eight, ten, 12, 15, 21,
42.

02:21:20.912 --> 02:21:25.748
MATT: With 42? Yeah, you (whack). He's out like a
light. Lights off, face on a pillow. The two

02:21:25.748 --> 02:21:31.422
women squeal in reaction. You guys, as you
rush under the door, what are you guys doing?

02:21:31.433 --> 02:21:35.449
WIL: I've been leaning over to see what he was
reaching for.

02:21:35.449 --> 02:21:42.586
MATT: As you glance over you can see what appears
to be a small jeweled blade that is hidden

02:21:42.586 --> 02:21:46.650
underneath one of the cushions there. It's a
curved dagger that comes to a gradual point.

02:21:46.650 --> 02:21:48.824
WIL: I'm going to take that.

02:21:48.824 --> 02:21:52.038
MATT: Okay. So mark down jeweled dagger in your
equipment.

02:21:52.038 --> 02:21:54.832
WILL: I want to search him. I want to see if he
has anything on him, in his pockets, anything.

02:21:54.832 --> 02:22:02.025
MATT: Okay. As you are beginning to go through his
body, you guys have rushed beneath, and as you can

02:22:02.025 --> 02:22:09.387
see, the dwarf, Hosin, is walking down the hallway
really quickly with his robes open.

02:22:09.387 --> 02:22:12.635
ORION: As a gadfly, can I really quickly buzz in
front of him?

02:22:12.635 --> 02:22:15.259
MATT: You pull underneath, because you had to go
underneath the door to make it into the hallway.

02:22:15.259 --> 02:22:21.255
You see him, he's about 15 feet away, and as he's
walking, he's looking about very nervously. He's

02:22:21.255 --> 02:22:27.314
seen one of the guards is approaching, and he
looks back over and sees the rat scurrying down

02:22:27.314 --> 02:22:28.361
the hallway.

02:22:28.361 --> 02:22:29.642
ORION: How far away is he from me?

02:22:29.642 --> 02:22:30.849
MATT: He's about 20 feet.

02:22:30.849 --> 02:22:33.531
ORION: How far away is the guard in front of him?

02:22:33.531 --> 02:22:38.386
MATT: You know what, let me go ahead and pull this
up. It'll give a good indicator of the

02:22:38.386 --> 02:22:39.852
circumstance here.

02:22:39.852 --> 02:22:42.186
MARISHA: He does what?

02:22:42.186 --> 02:22:47.735
ORION: Oh god, we have a map.

02:22:47.735 --> 02:22:50.276
LIAM: Gentlemen, we need to move.

02:22:50.276 --> 02:22:52.772
ORION: Okay, so he's right there.

02:22:52.772 --> 02:22:55.952
LIAM: Mama Cass, what have you found?

02:22:55.952 --> 02:23:03.546
MATT: All right, you guys are currently inspecting
him at the moment,

02:23:03.546 --> 02:23:04.890
as you guys are rushing through.

02:23:04.890 --> 02:23:07.318
ORION: Oh! So I'm within 20 feet of him,
whatever?

02:23:07.318 --> 02:23:13.025
MATT: Actually no, he'd be back here. He's just
rushing past. So he's 20 to 25 feet from you.

02:23:13.025 --> 02:23:23.305
ORION: Okay. Ah. I'm going to dispel Polymorph,
and I'm going to cast Silence in front of him. I'm

02:23:23.305 --> 02:23:24.744
going to silence him.

02:23:24.744 --> 02:23:30.823
MATT: Okay. All right, so you're using him as the
source?

02:23:30.823 --> 02:23:32.085
ORION: Yes.

02:23:32.085 --> 02:23:39.503
MATT: Okay. So as you un-Polymorph, he looks over
his shoulder and sees you take this form, you go

02:23:39.503 --> 02:23:47.514
ahead and cast Silence, which has an opposition.
What level spell is that? 2nd-level?

02:23:47.514 --> 02:23:51.153
ORION: Yes. I believe so.

02:23:51.153 --> 02:24:02.952
MATT: Okay, cool. So that creates a sphere of a
20-foot radius of silence here. So he goes and he

02:24:02.952 --> 02:24:09.085
does like a hand motion. Nothing happens.
Frustrated, he continues to run. I'm going to have

02:24:09.085 --> 02:24:11.503
you guys roll initiative.

02:24:11.503 --> 02:24:17.984
MARISHA: Fucking shit. 17.

02:24:17.984 --> 02:24:19.479
MATT: 17?

02:24:19.479 --> 02:24:24.781
ORION: Sorry. What is that? 17.

02:24:24.781 --> 02:24:34.171
MATT: 17 and 17. All right. So you guys will both
be going first, but before we finish that, as you

02:24:34.171 --> 02:24:39.146
guys are searching the body you hear all of a
sudden the sound of some sort of scuffle, a flash

02:24:39.146 --> 02:24:44.168
of some sort of energy in the hallway that's
muffled between the doorway, and footsteps also

02:24:44.168 --> 02:24:47.987
happening. As you're just starting to get through
his pockets you start hearing some sort of a

02:24:47.987 --> 02:24:50.327
scuffle outside of the room.

02:24:50.327 --> 02:24:51.670
WIL: I'm gone.

02:24:51.670 --> 02:24:52.763
WILL: Me, too.

02:24:52.763 --> 02:24:55.383
MATT: So I'll have you guys roll initiative, as
well.

02:24:55.383 --> 02:25:03.721
WIL: Four.

02:25:03.721 --> 02:25:05.626
MATT: All right.

02:25:05.626 --> 02:25:13.011
LIAM: Not great. Nine.

02:25:13.011 --> 02:25:15.007
WILL: 11.

02:25:15.007 --> 02:25:23.999
WIL: There's 20 faces on this. So. I mean, look
right? It can happen. I know that it's possible.

02:25:24.114 --> 02:25:26.297
I've done it in my life.

02:25:26.297 --> 02:25:30.804
MATT: All right, so as you guys are turning, we'll
get to your turn in a moment. Tiberius and

02:25:30.804 --> 02:25:32.648
Keyleth, you're up first.

02:25:32.648 --> 02:25:39.135
MARISHA: Are we at the same time? I guess I'll go
ahead and cast out of my beast shape as well and

02:25:39.135 --> 02:25:42.451
cast Hold Person on him as he's running away.

02:25:42.451 --> 02:25:46.149
MATT: Okay. Cool. Just staying where you are? Are
you going to stay there or are you going to move?

02:25:46.149 --> 02:25:47.600
MARISHA: Well, he's right there, right?

02:25:47.600 --> 02:25:49.215
MATT: Right there, yeah.

02:25:49.215 --> 02:25:50.624
MARISHA: So I'm just going to try and hold him.

02:25:50.624 --> 02:25:57.267
MATT: Okay, so you go ahead and cast Hold Person.
As the spell releases, you can see the mystical

02:25:57.267 --> 02:26:02.423
shimmering cage that seems to encapsulate, seems
to shrug it off.

02:26:02.423 --> 02:26:06.051
MARISHA: Because he's not a person! He's not a
person. I should've fucking done Grasping Vine.

02:26:06.051 --> 02:26:07.976
Goddamn it. All right.

02:26:07.976 --> 02:26:09.506
MATT: Do you want to move or are you staying where
you are?

02:26:09.506 --> 02:26:11.556
MARISHA: Yeah, I'll follow after his ass.

02:26:11.556 --> 02:26:15.159
MATT: All right, you can get up to pretty much
right adjacent to him if you want.

02:26:15.159 --> 02:26:17.080
All right. Tiberius?

02:26:17.080 --> 02:26:23.069
ORION: I'm going to cast Telekinesis and grab him
that way.

02:26:23.069 --> 02:26:27.391
MATT: Okay. So from where you are you go ahead and
you create your telekinetic force, you rush out,

02:26:27.391 --> 02:26:34.273
and the telekinetic force seems to have no effect
on the dwarf's form.

02:26:34.273 --> 02:26:36.717
ORION: It's the rakshasa! That's him!

02:26:36.717 --> 02:26:40.532
MATT: Do you move?

02:26:40.532 --> 02:26:47.124
ORION: No. I yell at you, don't chase him!

02:26:47.124 --> 02:26:50.251
MARISHA: And I go, what?

02:26:50.251 --> 02:26:55.326
MATT: Which you don't hear, because she goes [no
audio].

02:26:55.326 --> 02:26:57.392
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm in the silent bubble.

02:26:57.392 --> 02:26:59.898
MATT: Yeah, there is currently no sound coming
from the center of that area.

02:26:59.898 --> 02:27:01.089
ORION: But she can hear me.

02:27:01.089 --> 02:27:02.060
MATT: She can hear you.

02:27:02.060 --> 02:27:06.918
ORION: And I'm not that far. You heard me, the
other way! The other way! And I move in the room

02:27:06.918 --> 02:27:08.353
with these guys.

02:27:08.353 --> 02:27:12.251
MATT: Okay. As you guys turn, you see Tiberius
come rushing into the room.

02:27:12.251 --> 02:27:17.033
ORION: The rakshasa! Nothing works on him! And I
think that's not normal!

02:27:17.033 --> 02:27:18.872
LIAM: You're speaking Draconian!

02:27:18.872 --> 02:27:29.260
ORION: Yes, sorry! Rakshasa. I believe the dwarf
is the rakshasa. I cast many things, and Keyleth

02:27:29.260 --> 02:27:32.495
is in there, nothing hit him.

02:27:32.495 --> 02:27:37.404
LIAM: You left her with him? I shove past him and
go straight through the door.

02:27:37.404 --> 02:27:47.600
WIL: You ran away from the target? Ugh. I stomp
past him in my dwarfy stomps.

02:27:47.600 --> 02:27:54.296
MATT: Hosin gets just out of the sphere of silence
and then angrily does a motion

02:27:54.296 --> 02:27:55.952
with a hand and then--

02:27:55.952 --> 02:27:58.658
(shouting)

02:27:58.658 --> 02:28:00.752
MARISHA: I knew it was going to happen!

02:28:00.752 --> 02:28:08.978
MATT: That'll bring us next to Brother Kash.
Kashaw. What do you want to do?

02:28:08.978 --> 02:28:15.514
WILL: I want to go back eight moves and catch the
thing. I think what we're going to have to do now

02:28:15.514 --> 02:28:20.716
is find out where he is. Let's Locate Creature
again, if we can.

02:28:20.716 --> 02:28:26.875
MATT: Okay, this is during your turn. Is there
anything you want to do?

02:28:26.875 --> 02:28:29.233
WILL: Can we locate creature, see how close he
is?

02:28:29.233 --> 02:28:30.884
MATT: How long does it take to cast Locate
Creature?

02:28:30.884 --> 02:28:33.055
WILL: I believe it is one action.

02:28:33.055 --> 02:28:37.595
MATT: Okay, so you can do that, so you mark that
off as another casting of that spell.

02:28:37.595 --> 02:28:38.719
WILL: Okay.

02:28:38.719 --> 02:28:45.148
MATT: As you rush out into the hallway and see
that it's vanishing, you cast the spell for a

02:28:45.148 --> 02:28:51.820
second, you can see the direction of the creature
is roughly ahead of you and you also see a door on

02:28:51.820 --> 02:28:56.255
the opposite side, this right-hand door open and
close.

02:28:56.255 --> 02:29:02.753
MARISHA: He goes invisible? He's not teleporting,
he's just invisible. That's a big thing.

02:29:02.753 --> 02:29:05.438
WILL: Yeah, he's here. He's still here. We can't
see him.

02:29:05.438 --> 02:29:08.671
MATT: You still have 15 feet of movement, if you
want to move forward.

02:29:08.671 --> 02:29:10.229
WILL: Yeah, I would like to move forward.

02:29:10.229 --> 02:29:14.902
MATT: Okay. So you'll get up to that point with
your turn. And you gather that that's the

02:29:14.902 --> 02:29:17.745
direction of him, and that you know that's where
it's going.

02:29:17.745 --> 02:29:20.984
WILL: I know where it's going, okay. So we saw the
door shut. That's where he is, let's go.

02:29:20.984 --> 02:29:23.046
LIAM: Don't run blindly in there, hold on.

02:29:23.046 --> 02:29:24.209
MATT: Vax, you're up.

02:29:24.209 --> 02:29:32.903
LIAM: I'm going to run just up past Keyleth, I'm
going to look at her as I pass. Not bad. Keep

02:29:32.903 --> 02:29:35.502
going, stop there, and now I'm going to try to
sense traps.

02:29:35.502 --> 02:29:40.712
MATT: At this point, there? Okay, so you can get
up to here if you're going to use an action as

02:29:40.712 --> 02:29:42.236
well to dash.

02:29:42.236 --> 02:29:44.128
LIAM: If I use, that's fine, yeah.

02:29:44.128 --> 02:29:48.559
MATT: Okay, as you go to talk to her no words come
out.

02:29:48.559 --> 02:29:51.927
ORION: Can I see what's going on?

02:29:51.927 --> 02:29:56.918
MATT: No, you're in the other room, still.
Everyone darted out and you're making your way

02:29:56.918 --> 02:29:59.191
out. So go ahead and make a perception check.

02:29:59.191 --> 02:30:02.120
LIAM: Okay. 21.

02:30:02.120 --> 02:30:07.973
MATT: 21. Glancing about the room, there doesn't
appear to be anything that catches you as a trap.

02:30:07.973 --> 02:30:14.762
This hallway is fairly often-traversed by the
clientele of this establishment, and nothing seems

02:30:14.762 --> 02:30:18.132
dangerous. That would be difficult to put in the
middle of a place and still run a business.

02:30:18.132 --> 02:30:27.091
LIAM: Okay. I look at Kash and Keyleth and say--
Are we out of initiative?

02:30:27.091 --> 02:30:28.178
We're still in initiative.

02:30:28.178 --> 02:30:29.501
MATT: We're still in initiative. Currently, for
the moment,

02:30:29.501 --> 02:30:31.095
just for the sake of the pacing on this.

02:30:31.095 --> 02:30:35.133
WIL: I'm going as far as I can down the hall
toward the direction of the bad guy.

02:30:35.133 --> 02:30:41.476
MATT: Okay. That gets you to about there. Cool,
that ends that turn, at which point three of the

02:30:41.476 --> 02:30:46.693
bouncers then start pushing through the silks. One
of them pushes his way here, this one pushes

02:30:46.693 --> 02:30:55.480
aside, and they come out, weapons drawn, seeing
all of you there, and one of them goes [no audio].

02:30:55.480 --> 02:31:04.256
That's their turn, but it looks like they're ready
to jump into some sort of combat circumstance.

02:31:04.256 --> 02:31:07.172
That brings us to the top of the round, Tiberius,
you're up.

02:31:07.172 --> 02:31:10.245
ORION: Where'd you say the guards came from?

02:31:10.245 --> 02:31:14.749
MATT: They came from the main room, where the
silks are that separate the hallway from the main

02:31:14.749 --> 02:31:20.978
area. And you start hearing people shouting and
some slight yelps and screams from the other

02:31:20.978 --> 02:31:24.664
room.People who seem freaked out by the sudden
rise in energy.

02:31:24.664 --> 02:31:26.471
ORION: What was that guy's name? Lohan?

02:31:26.471 --> 02:31:27.546
WIL: Hosin?

02:31:27.546 --> 02:31:28.571
ORION: Hosin?

02:31:28.571 --> 02:31:31.590
WIL: The dwarf is Hosin. The other guy is Vince.

02:31:31.590 --> 02:31:39.395
ORION: I just disperse Silence, and before I go
out, I turn into Hosin. Alter Self.

02:31:39.395 --> 02:31:45.902
MATT: Okay, so you use your action to cast Alter
Self. You take Hosin's form, step out, closing the

02:31:45.902 --> 02:31:47.559
door behind you.

02:31:47.559 --> 02:31:49.610
ORION: How did he sound, again?

02:31:49.610 --> 02:31:51.133
MATT: How did he sound?

02:31:51.133 --> 02:31:52.525
ORION: I don't remember.

02:31:52.525 --> 02:31:54.188
MARISHA: He's a dwarf.

02:31:54.188 --> 02:31:57.637
WILL: He was Scottish, but fancy Scottish.

02:31:57.637 --> 02:32:00.214
LIAM: He's glam rock. Glam rock.

02:32:00.214 --> 02:32:02.873
ORION: Oh, right, right. What's all this noise out
here?

02:32:02.873 --> 02:32:06.417
What are you bothering my friends for? Guards!

02:32:06.417 --> 02:32:10.559
MATT: The guards look over confused and, "We heard
there was a--"

02:32:10.559 --> 02:32:16.304
ORION: Everything's fine. These are friends. Get
on with your business. Get back on patrol. Make

02:32:16.304 --> 02:32:18.823
sure nothing happens or I'll have your heads.

02:32:18.823 --> 02:32:20.807
MATT: Make a deception check.

02:32:20.807 --> 02:32:25.545
MARISHA: Oh, come on, Tiberius.

02:32:25.545 --> 02:32:27.141
ORION: 28.

02:32:27.141 --> 02:32:35.258
MATT: The guards look at each other. "All right,
but if anything happens again, there's a problem,

02:32:35.258 --> 02:32:41.534
"let us know. We'll be at the ready." They sheathe
their weapons and look untrustingly to the rest of

02:32:41.534 --> 02:32:44.411
your group with your weapons currently drawn and
step back--

02:32:44.411 --> 02:32:45.882
ORION: Go on, get out.

02:32:45.882 --> 02:32:50.273
MATT: They disappear back into the main room and
they start calming down some of the other patrons

02:32:50.273 --> 02:32:53.637
who are starting to peek around them, trying to
see what's going on, the action. Some look smiling

02:32:53.637 --> 02:32:57.871
and curious to see what's happening, and they're,
"Go back to your tables. It's fine; there's no

02:32:57.871 --> 02:33:00.484
"problem." And they disperse the energy.

02:33:00.484 --> 02:33:05.087
LIAM: Not bad, Tiberius.

02:33:05.087 --> 02:33:17.142
MARISHA: With that, I continue with the charade
and loop my arm around Vax and say, shall we go

02:33:17.142 --> 02:33:19.148
into that room?

02:33:19.148 --> 02:33:27.119
LIAM: Just a moment, dear. Pull out the same
poisoned blade and start walking down that hall a

02:33:27.119 --> 02:33:31.065
little further, and I want to see if I sense any
traps further ahead.

02:33:31.065 --> 02:33:34.160
MATT: Okay, to about there? Make a perception
check.

02:33:34.160 --> 02:33:36.785
LIAM: Natural 20.

02:33:36.785 --> 02:33:51.977
WIL: And balance was restored to the universe. Oh
god, don't do that! Come on!

02:33:51.977 --> 02:33:57.528
MATT: Put it away. Watch as the dice just like
turns to dust.

02:33:57.528 --> 02:34:01.288
WIL: It's the end of Raiders.

02:34:01.288 --> 02:34:06.306
MATT: Exactly. You glance about the room as you're
walking forward carefully, looking at the

02:34:06.306 --> 02:34:09.877
floorboards, looking at the tapestries on the
walls, looking for anything that would be out of

02:34:09.877 --> 02:34:14.174
sorts, and your eyes very keen to find anything
out of the ordinary. The room thankfully does not

02:34:14.174 --> 02:34:16.702
appear to have anything specifically trapped. It
seems fairly safe.

02:34:16.702 --> 02:34:20.096
LIAM: Oh. Okay. And those are doors up there?

02:34:20.096 --> 02:34:21.693
MATT: Yeah. Door to the right, door to the left.

02:34:21.693 --> 02:34:23.895
LIAM: Would that check include the doors
themselves?

02:34:23.895 --> 02:34:27.639
MATT: I would say with a natural 20, yes. The
doors both also seem to be functional doors, not

02:34:27.639 --> 02:34:29.460
designed with any sort of trap attached.

02:34:29.460 --> 02:34:31.774
LIAM: All right. Pressing my ear to the door on my
left.

02:34:31.774 --> 02:34:37.076
MATT: Okay. Listen to it. Perception roll.

02:34:37.076 --> 02:34:39.922
LIAM: So many. Six.

02:34:39.922 --> 02:34:41.547
MATT: Seems fairly quiet.

02:34:41.547 --> 02:34:44.716
ORION: If we've stopped pursuing, does that take
us out of initiative?

02:34:44.716 --> 02:34:47.874
MATT: You guys are not, you guys are not currently
in initiative because you're not in the thick of

02:34:47.874 --> 02:34:50.296
battle. You managed to disperse the conflict.

02:34:50.296 --> 02:34:52.158
LIAM: I want to do it at the other door as well.

02:34:52.158 --> 02:34:54.393
MATT: All right, you step to the other door. You
guys want to do anything else while you're waiting

02:34:54.393 --> 02:34:55.589
on him?

02:34:55.589 --> 02:34:59.589
WIL: I'm just going to come, I want to get as
close to him as I can and I'm ready for a fight.

02:34:59.589 --> 02:35:00.806
MARISHA: Yeah, I follow.

02:35:00.806 --> 02:35:08.401
ORION: Thorbir. Do you have an extra sword or arm
on you? Perhaps a shortsword?

02:35:08.401 --> 02:35:11.683
WIL: I give him the jeweled dagger.

02:35:11.683 --> 02:35:13.513
LIAM: That one's a 19.

02:35:13.513 --> 02:35:21.973
MATT: 19? Listening, you hear what sounds like a
slight (creak) sound, some sort of a scooting of

02:35:21.973 --> 02:35:24.533
wood on wood, and then silence.

02:35:24.533 --> 02:35:26.757
LIAM: Kick in the door. Hard as I can.

02:35:26.757 --> 02:35:30.675
MATT: Okay. Make a strength roll. This would be
straight strength.

02:35:30.675 --> 02:35:37.437
LIAM: Wait, that's the wrong guy. 12. 14.

02:35:37.437 --> 02:35:41.446
ORION: As he's doing that, I'm going to drink a
potion of frost giant strength.

02:35:41.446 --> 02:35:50.069
MATT: Okay. You slam your foot into the door. Oh,
that was the foot that you just got healed. Oh,

02:35:50.069 --> 02:35:54.527
that's going to bruise. That's really going to
bruise.

02:35:54.527 --> 02:35:58.016
LIAM: Keyleth-- Coralin, darling, could you come
up here please?

02:35:58.016 --> 02:36:01.226
MARISHA: Yes? Did you stub your toe, darling?

02:36:01.226 --> 02:36:06.050
LIAM: Yeah. I think I want to get this door open
quickly, please.

02:36:06.050 --> 02:36:07.943
WIL: I'm going to hit the door with my axe.

02:36:07.943 --> 02:36:14.016
MATT: Okay. Go for it and roll. What did you
roll?

02:36:14.016 --> 02:36:15.894
LIAM: A one!

02:36:15.894 --> 02:36:22.907
MARISHA: No way! It's a lie. If it wasn't live, no
one would believe it.

02:36:22.907 --> 02:36:28.540
WIL: I rolled a one. Because it is what I do.

02:36:28.540 --> 02:36:34.700
MATT: I'm going to test this theory. I'm going to
trade you, for now, and I'm going to leave you

02:36:34.700 --> 02:36:39.036
with that dice and see if it has any impact
whatsoever.

02:36:39.036 --> 02:36:42.612
LIAM: You have to throw it into the fire, Mr.
Frodo!

02:36:42.612 --> 02:36:47.682
WIL: The curse doesn't care about which die is
rolled.

02:36:47.682 --> 02:36:50.135
MATT: Which is very possible, but there needs to
be--

02:36:50.135 --> 02:36:52.247
LIAM: This is like science class.

02:36:52.247 --> 02:36:57.244
MARISHA: Maybe it's because that dice was in the
vicinity of Matt's hair, you'll be good.

02:36:57.244 --> 02:37:03.334
MATT: All right.

02:37:03.334 --> 02:37:08.271
WIL: So how much damage do I take for some
reason?

02:37:08.271 --> 02:37:14.523
MATT: So as you pull back the axe, you actually
swing wildly backward, nearly hitting Vax in the

02:37:14.523 --> 02:37:18.847
process. You have to dodge out of the way as the
axe embeds itself into the wood behind you.

02:37:18.847 --> 02:37:23.295
WIL: Ugh. Again.

02:37:23.295 --> 02:37:25.075
MATT: Axe is stuck.

02:37:25.075 --> 02:37:30.380
LIAM: I slap myself on the forehead and go ugh.
Pull out thieves' pick and start on the lock.

02:37:30.380 --> 02:37:38.934
MATT: Okay, you unclasp. As you do, you feel your
throat seize suddenly as the cold liquid tends to

02:37:38.934 --> 02:37:47.289
freeze up what is normally a very warm and very
fire-breeding interior to your throat. And it

02:37:47.289 --> 02:37:55.268
thaws slowly, and as you exhale you can see the
mist, and suddenly your muscles pulse with energy

02:37:55.268 --> 02:38:00.046
and you feel like your physical form is embodied
strength far more than you've ever felt in your

02:38:00.046 --> 02:38:01.680
body before.

02:38:01.680 --> 02:38:06.694
ORION: With his jeweled dagger, I take out my
dagger. I feel great.

02:38:06.694 --> 02:38:08.452
LIAM: The freshmaker.

02:38:08.452 --> 02:38:12.786
MATT: There's now the angriest dwarf right now
clutching two daggers as you get down with your

02:38:12.786 --> 02:38:13.987
thieves' tools.

02:38:13.987 --> 02:38:17.396
LIAM: Yeah, let's try to leave the room. That's
better. That's a 24.

02:38:17.396 --> 02:38:27.453
MATT: All right. The door swings open without
issue. It's one of the easier jobs you've had.

02:38:27.453 --> 02:38:29.248
LIAM: I should've done that in the first place.

02:38:29.248 --> 02:38:31.984
MARISHA: Yeah! Should've beat it down and then.

02:38:31.984 --> 02:38:35.850
MATT: You push open the door and find your way
into what looks like a very well-adorned bedroom.

02:38:35.850 --> 02:38:41.618
There is a small table on the side where there are
some books stacked up. There's a dresser on the

02:38:41.618 --> 02:38:48.729
far end that's closed. There is a canopy bed set
up. There is a small end-table on the side. And

02:38:48.729 --> 02:38:55.127
the rest of the room has a nice circular rug
that's thrown across the center, and there are no

02:38:55.127 --> 02:38:57.239
windows currently to this room.

02:38:57.239 --> 02:39:03.050
LIAM: I turn my head to everyone and just mouth
the words-- and perception check the room.

02:39:03.050 --> 02:39:06.037
MARISHA: Can I perception check, as well?

02:39:06.037 --> 02:39:07.312
LIAM: 24.

02:39:07.312 --> 02:39:11.795
MARISHA: Can I just look to see, I want to just
meditate and-- what did you just roll? 24?

02:39:11.795 --> 02:39:12.759
LIAM: 24.

02:39:12.759 --> 02:39:18.008
MARISHA: I want to see if I see any movements or
brushes of cloth or anything like that.

02:39:18.008 --> 02:39:19.388
MATT: Okay.

02:39:19.388 --> 02:39:22.837
MARISHA: 19. Not as good as Vax.

02:39:22.837 --> 02:39:24.681
MATT: All right.

02:39:24.681 --> 02:39:31.049
WIL: How long does it take me to pull the axe out
of the wall, and how far into Yakety Sax does the

02:39:31.049 --> 02:39:40.088
soundtrack get while I'm up there and with the
foot and then I'm jumping on it and trying to pull

02:39:40.088 --> 02:39:41.563
it down.

02:39:41.563 --> 02:39:46.701
MATT: We're currently hitting the one minute 15
second mark. Haven't quite pulled it out of the

02:39:46.701 --> 02:39:47.783
wood yet.

02:39:47.783 --> 02:39:53.090
WIL: Okay, good. And my little legs are kicking
underneath me while I pull it down, cursing in

02:39:53.090 --> 02:39:53.988
Dwarven.

02:39:53.988 --> 02:39:56.944
LIAM: They call me Benny. Benny Hill.

02:39:56.944 --> 02:40:01.215
MATT: Do you wish to enter the room?

02:40:01.215 --> 02:40:06.590
WILL: I don't, actually. Because of all the sound,
I wish to turn my back to the room and guard the

02:40:06.590 --> 02:40:08.935
hallway while everybody else is inside checking
out the room.

02:40:08.935 --> 02:40:11.132
MATT: Okay, you're keeping an eye out, and you do
see that there's one of the guards just to the

02:40:11.132 --> 02:40:16.184
side who's just keeping an eye looking over
carefully. You guys make a perception check,

02:40:16.184 --> 02:40:20.741
looking around the room, you see there is no
movement, there are no curtains on the walls.

02:40:20.741 --> 02:40:26.783
There is the rug, and most everything else in here
seems to be perfectly still. You catch what looks

02:40:26.783 --> 02:40:32.476
like a little bit of movement of the canopy bed,
the material that's on top. There's a slight sway

02:40:32.476 --> 02:40:37.830
to it that comes to stillness you just barely
catch with your keen half-elven eye.

02:40:37.830 --> 02:40:50.012
LIAM: I would like to run up the bed and stab up.
Both hands. Clicking the Boots of Haste.

02:40:50.012 --> 02:40:54.639
MATT: Okay. (bam) Click the Boots of Haste, you
run and charge up into the bed and stab upward

02:40:54.639 --> 02:41:02.060
into the canopy. The material is torn asunder,
this very fine, probably imported silk is carved

02:41:02.060 --> 02:41:07.513
into three separate ribbons and falls gently onto
the cushion of the bed proper, revealing the

02:41:07.513 --> 02:41:09.395
hardwood ceiling above you.

02:41:09.395 --> 02:41:18.960
LIAM: I'm going to check the ceiling. There's a
lot of perception. I'm all out of Luck. That's no

02:41:18.960 --> 02:41:20.676
good. That's a 14.

02:41:20.676 --> 02:41:24.019
MATT: 14, looking about, it's solid wood, you can
move your fingers along and you're standing on the

02:41:24.019 --> 02:41:27.224
bed, you can just get it within reach, and feeling
along the board, it's all pretty solid.

02:41:27.224 --> 02:41:38.303
MARISHA: I want to make myself soccer field goalie
this stuff with the door, in the door frame, just

02:41:38.303 --> 02:41:43.235
really trying to see if I can see any brush of
dust or movement.

02:41:43.235 --> 02:41:52.054
MATT: Okay. Keeping an eye out. You pull your axe
free. Into the hallway door in front of you. Not a

02:41:52.054 --> 02:41:55.271
lot of strength. You pull it out and try the best
you can to save some grace.

02:41:55.271 --> 02:42:00.071
WILL: Well done. Yeah, that was graceful.

02:42:00.071 --> 02:42:02.447
LIAM: I motion Tiberius over.

02:42:02.447 --> 02:42:09.225
ORION: Should I do a perception on that? Nope.

02:42:09.225 --> 02:42:12.495
MATT: That ceiling looks pretty solid.

02:42:12.495 --> 02:42:17.529
WILL: Can I turn, saving my back to the door, I
turn over. I do a perception check.

02:42:17.529 --> 02:42:20.068
MATT: Go for it. You step over, you glance past
Keyleth.

02:42:20.068 --> 02:42:21.434
WILL: Oh my god, one.

02:42:21.434 --> 02:42:27.970
WIL: Stop trying to steal my thing, you guys.

02:42:27.970 --> 02:42:32.513
MATT: You glance over and you're more distracted
by the fact that Keyleth is doing this awkward

02:42:32.513 --> 02:42:37.596
field goal thing in the door to you for no reason,
and you forget

02:42:37.596 --> 02:42:39.415
what you were in the middle of doing.

02:42:39.415 --> 02:42:40.649
MARISHA: I'm trying to make myself big.

02:42:40.649 --> 02:42:42.845
MATT: There appears to be no exit from the
ceiling.

02:42:42.845 --> 02:42:44.097
WIL: Can I enter the room?

02:42:44.097 --> 02:42:46.163
MATT: You may. You push past the confused cleric.

02:42:46.163 --> 02:42:53.691
WIL: Okay, so I look around. I look at the rug. I
sigh heavily. And I pull the rug.

02:42:53.691 --> 02:42:59.086
MATT: You pull the rug, revealing a wooden floor.
Plain slats.

02:42:59.086 --> 02:43:01.098
MARISHA: You thought that was going to be good!

02:43:01.098 --> 02:43:05.778
WILL: With a point, too!

02:43:05.778 --> 02:43:13.676
MATT: You were never a fan of elves or half-elves
before, but this one's really starting to dig into

02:43:13.676 --> 02:43:15.094
you a little.

02:43:15.094 --> 02:43:21.354
WIL: I'll make a perception check because we could
total up all my rolls and I'd have five.

02:43:21.354 --> 02:43:23.755
LIAM: Come on. Hey!

02:43:23.755 --> 02:43:27.383
WIL: Look at that. That's actually better. 20.

02:43:27.383 --> 02:43:32.438
MATT: 20. You pull the rug back. There's nothing
there, and you look about at the rest of the folks

02:43:32.438 --> 02:43:40.394
with a heavy sigh. But the rug was on the right
track. Everyone was keeping high. Looking beneath

02:43:40.394 --> 02:43:48.220
the bed, you can see what looks to be, in the
shadow, some little bit of elevated wood that

02:43:48.220 --> 02:43:50.351
catches your attention.

02:43:50.351 --> 02:43:58.190
WIL: I just, under the bed!

02:43:58.190 --> 02:44:01.581
ORION: Oh! I'll motion over there.

02:44:01.581 --> 02:44:08.062
LIAM: We're not silenced, right? So I'm yanking
off any fancy clothes I have on and I'm pulling my

02:44:08.062 --> 02:44:14.285
Cloak of Elvenkind out. I'm putting it over. And I
spider under the bed and check it for traps.

02:44:14.285 --> 02:44:17.519
MARISHA: I pick up his clothes and I put them in
the Bag of Holding.

02:44:17.519 --> 02:44:19.657
WILL: Oh my god, she's folding the clothes. We're
in the middle of this,

02:44:19.657 --> 02:44:20.881
and she's folding the clothes.

02:44:20.881 --> 02:44:23.184
MARISHA: They might come in handy later.

02:44:23.184 --> 02:44:25.343
LIAM: 25 for looking for traps.

02:44:25.343 --> 02:44:28.799
MATT: Okay. Well, it's a good thing you rolled
high enough perception, because as you spider

02:44:28.799 --> 02:44:35.521
underneath, your first hand goes underneath and
you nearly tumble and you catch yourself. There is

02:44:35.521 --> 02:44:41.570
a five-foot-wide hole in the ground right beneath
this bed. And as you catch yourself, you can feel

02:44:41.570 --> 02:44:47.816
a little bit of wind slowly drifting up from
underneath. There's some sort of airflow coming up

02:44:47.816 --> 02:44:50.836
from underneath this bed where this hole is, and
you feel over and you can see that little bit of

02:44:50.836 --> 02:44:55.300
wood that you saw looking forward is the top of a
makeshift ladder that is currently fastened to the

02:44:55.300 --> 02:44:57.521
side of this tunnel that disappears beneath the
room.

02:44:57.521 --> 02:44:58.908
LIAM: Is there dim light down there?

02:44:58.908 --> 02:45:03.475
MATT: It is pitch black. You can see with the dim
light from your low-light vision a little ways

02:45:03.475 --> 02:45:08.859
into it, about 20 or so feet from the angle you're
at, because you're not looking directly in. And

02:45:08.859 --> 02:45:12.129
even just glancing over the side it continues down
for quite a while.

02:45:12.129 --> 02:45:16.292
WILL: And it's big enough to fit all of us if we
wanted to go.

02:45:16.292 --> 02:45:19.567
MATT: Independently, yes. One person would go
down. It would be single file, of course, because

02:45:19.567 --> 02:45:21.430
it's a tight tunnel.

02:45:21.430 --> 02:45:24.215
WILL: Only one way to go, right?

02:45:24.215 --> 02:45:26.583
LIAM: You can see in pitch black, right?

02:45:26.583 --> 02:45:29.376
WIL: I have darkvision, 60 feet.

02:45:29.376 --> 02:45:31.631
LIAM: Is that dim or dark?

02:45:31.631 --> 02:45:32.621
WIL: Dark.

02:45:32.621 --> 02:45:38.502
MATT: Darkvision, you can see within a short
distance of pitch black and then a larger distance at

02:45:38.502 --> 02:45:39.899
low light, so yeah.

02:45:39.899 --> 02:45:41.253
WIL: I'll go.

02:45:41.253 --> 02:45:47.699
MATT: All right. So we'll put in order here, who's
going down next? All right. And after Vax?

02:45:47.699 --> 02:45:50.224
MARISHA: I'll follow my husband.

02:45:50.224 --> 02:45:52.498
MATT: Keyleth. That's weird. Tiberius?

02:45:52.498 --> 02:45:58.712
ORION: Before we go down, I'm going to take off my
outer-- no, I can't take off anything because

02:45:58.712 --> 02:46:05.462
that's all my gear. Never mind. I don't do that,
but before we go down I cast Stoneskin on myself.

02:46:05.462 --> 02:46:07.908
I cast that right now.

02:46:07.908 --> 02:46:13.614
MATT: Okay. As your form shimmers for a second and
you see-- you notice this too, Kashaw-- his scales

02:46:13.614 --> 02:46:18.782
almost seem to protrude into earthy spikes and
then form and solidify, almost like his body

02:46:18.782 --> 02:46:20.644
becomes its own suit of armor.

02:46:20.644 --> 02:46:21.852
WILL: Okay, that's cool.

02:46:21.852 --> 02:46:23.839
ORION: Even though I'm still a dwarf, though.

02:46:23.839 --> 02:46:27.505
WILL: I'm going to go, but I'm going to cast
Freedom of Movement

02:46:27.505 --> 02:46:29.232
on myself before I go down there.

02:46:29.232 --> 02:46:34.552
MATT: Okay. As you do, even with the encumbrance
of the armor you're wearing, you feel like your

02:46:34.660 --> 02:46:40.636
form is a little more agile and you're ready for
anything that might try and stop your passage. You

02:46:40.636 --> 02:46:47.436
guys begin making your way down, with Thorbir
leading the way. You descend for a good three to

02:46:47.436 --> 02:46:52.149
four minutes, you gather probably a hundred feet
or more down, rung by rung, and there are a few

02:46:52.149 --> 02:46:57.093
that you reach that are a little rickety. About a
hundred feet down, one hits your foot and snaps,

02:46:57.093 --> 02:47:02.072
but you manage to catch yourself on it, but you
get the feeling this ladder is probably not meant

02:47:02.072 --> 02:47:06.245
to hold someone of your heavy physical form.

02:47:06.245 --> 02:47:07.854
WIL: Largesse?

02:47:07.854 --> 02:47:13.322
MATT: Largesse, you could use, yes. One by one,
you make your way down until eventually you're,

02:47:13.322 --> 02:47:20.761
you begin to see towards the edge of your
darkvision, floor finally begins to appear and rise

02:47:20.761 --> 02:47:27.179
towards you. You step off the ladder into what
appears to be a small circular area that leads

02:47:27.179 --> 02:47:34.126
into another ten-foot-by-ten-foot tunnel, ten by
15 foot up, and continues forward. This is very

02:47:34.126 --> 02:47:37.147
natural carved earth, it's not smoothed stone, it
just looks like a tunnel

02:47:37.147 --> 02:47:39.284
that was mined out of the floor.

02:47:39.284 --> 02:47:40.447
WILL: Is it still dark?

02:47:40.447 --> 02:47:42.378
MATT: It is still dark, there is no light source
currently.

02:47:42.378 --> 02:47:44.053
And you all eventually make your way down.

02:47:44.053 --> 02:47:46.563
WILL: Is there anything loose down there that I
can grab a hold of?

02:47:46.563 --> 02:47:50.738
MATT: You can't see anything. Mr. Human, you are
in pitch-black darkness.

02:47:50.738 --> 02:47:55.107
WILL: Well, that's why I'm wondering if I feel
around underneath me to try to find some kind-- do

02:47:55.107 --> 02:47:57.786
I find a loose stone? Do I find a pebble? Can I
find anything to grab?

02:47:57.786 --> 02:48:00.497
MATT: Reach down, yeah, you manage to find a
couple of small stones.

02:48:00.497 --> 02:48:02.070
ORION: As he's milling about, Light.

02:48:02.070 --> 02:48:04.496
WILL: That's what I was going to do, but he beat
me to it. Thank you.

02:48:04.496 --> 02:48:11.388
MATT: So you reach down and you find a stone, you
pick it up, you begrudgingly grab your holy

02:48:11.388 --> 02:48:17.046
symbol, and as you begin to recite your cantrip
incantation, a flash of white light comes gleaming

02:48:17.046 --> 02:48:20.048
off the top of the dragonborn sorcerer's staff.

02:48:20.048 --> 02:48:22.868
ORION: Dagger. Because I have two daggers in my
hands.

02:48:22.868 --> 02:48:26.569
MATT: That's true. One of the daggers is now
glowing. The jeweled one, twice as pretty when

02:48:26.569 --> 02:48:28.571
it's emanating torchlight.

02:48:28.571 --> 02:48:32.279
WILL: Nice. Thanks for the warning, by the way.

02:48:32.279 --> 02:48:34.637
ORION: Sorry, I usually just do it when it's
dark.

02:48:34.637 --> 02:48:36.728
WIL: This tunnel goes in just one direction?

02:48:36.728 --> 02:48:37.973
MATT: One direction.

02:48:37.973 --> 02:48:40.079
WIL: I'm walking down the tunnel.

02:48:40.079 --> 02:48:51.775
MATT: Okay. So we'll say for the sake of marching
order, who all is going in after Thorbir?

02:48:51.775 --> 02:48:53.808
In what order?

02:48:53.808 --> 02:48:55.350
WILL: I'll go next.

02:48:55.350 --> 02:48:56.779
MATT: All right. Following Thorbir.

02:48:56.779 --> 02:48:59.346
LIAM: I'll go behind Kash.

02:48:59.346 --> 02:49:02.581
WILL: I don't need this at all, but I just wanted
to play with it. That's me right there.

02:49:02.581 --> 02:49:08.644
ORION: I'll follow. I'll keep on Thorbir's six.

02:49:08.644 --> 02:49:10.235
MATT: Okay.

02:49:10.235 --> 02:49:13.597
ORION: I'll stay 15 feet behind him.

02:49:13.597 --> 02:49:18.599
MATT: 15 feet behind? All right. And Keyleth, you
continue up that way. All right, so that'll be the

02:49:18.599 --> 02:49:19.900
marching order.

02:49:19.900 --> 02:49:26.675
WIL: So I've got my axe out. And may I make a
perception check to see what I see? To just see if

02:49:26.675 --> 02:49:30.246
I can pick up footprints or motion or whatever?

02:49:30.246 --> 02:49:37.148
MATT: This would be more tracking, if you're
looking for footprints, so that'd be wisdom.

02:49:37.148 --> 02:49:42.102
WIL: Okay. Just a straight wisdom?

02:49:42.102 --> 02:49:43.489
MATT: Survival.

02:49:43.489 --> 02:49:48.977
WIL: Survival, hang on. Not my system. Eight.

02:49:48.977 --> 02:49:58.235
MATT: Eight? Okay. It's hard to tell. It looks
like this area is not heavily traversed, and what

02:49:58.235 --> 02:50:02.740
little sign of footprints there are scattered
enough that it's hard to make out a specific

02:50:02.740 --> 02:50:05.863
print. But I mean, they have been traveled
before.

02:50:05.863 --> 02:50:12.296
LIAM: I'm looking over Thorbir's head and looking
for traps as he walks from behind. 22.

02:50:12.296 --> 02:50:19.661
MATT: 22? All right. As you guys are walking
forward and going through this, you get about 40

02:50:19.661 --> 02:50:26.303
feet forward before you catch that there is a
slight divot, a small drop in the dirt, and one

02:50:26.303 --> 02:50:32.850
looks like a section of intentionally placed plate
of some kind.

02:50:32.850 --> 02:50:39.628
LIAM: Wait a tick. I'm going to go up to the edge
of it and try to inspect it and see if I can find

02:50:39.628 --> 02:50:47.281
a trigger or see how it works. Six. And that is,
what is that, perception?

02:50:47.281 --> 02:50:49.314
MATT: Are you checking to see how it works?

02:50:49.314 --> 02:50:51.522
LIAM: I want to see if I can disarm.

02:50:51.522 --> 02:50:55.861
MATT: To disarm it. Okay, that would be with your
thieves' tools. So this would be a dexterity plus

02:50:55.861 --> 02:50:57.741
your thieves' tools, so plus seven.

02:50:57.741 --> 02:50:59.245
LIAM: That's a 19.

02:50:59.245 --> 02:51:05.274
MATT: 19? Okay. As you go to the plate, you stop
and look up at the walls to the side, and to each

02:51:05.274 --> 02:51:08.860
side of the wall you can see these tiny little
holes, these little quarter-sized,

02:51:08.860 --> 02:51:17.143
gold-piece-sized tunnels bored multiple places on
both sides of this wall. And you take the plate,

02:51:17.143 --> 02:51:23.616
you realize this is a pressure plate-based trap,
and taking one dagger, you slightly lift it. The

02:51:23.616 --> 02:51:30.764
second one, you eventually find beneath where the
trigger apparatus is, and you gingerly cut each

02:51:30.764 --> 02:51:35.423
part of these spring-loaded triggers until
eventually the plate rises more and more and more

02:51:35.423 --> 02:51:40.552
and you remove the last bit, the plate tips over,
and the trap itself is disarmed.

02:51:40.552 --> 02:51:42.323
WILL: Nice work.

02:51:42.323 --> 02:51:44.651
ORION: I mean, well done, rogue.

02:51:44.651 --> 02:51:55.787
WIL: So I keep going down. I want to hit a thing.

02:51:55.787 --> 02:51:58.506
MATT: All righty.

02:51:58.506 --> 02:52:00.440
WIL: That's not a wall.

02:52:00.440 --> 02:52:11.434
MATT: There is that. All right. Pushing forward,
continuing for another 30-40 feet, do you want to

02:52:11.434 --> 02:52:12.824
check traps again?

02:52:12.824 --> 02:52:14.784
LIAM: Again. 12.

02:52:14.784 --> 02:52:21.045
MATT: 12? Okay. Pushing forward for a period of
time, there doesn't appear to be any change. There

02:52:21.045 --> 02:52:25.784
are no more divots. You're keeping a very close
eye for the traps. And as you're walking forward

02:52:25.784 --> 02:52:31.061
with your axe. As you're stepping forward you get
this weird tickle across your nose, like a spider

02:52:31.061 --> 02:52:35.216
web of some kind that catches you, and you
instinctively reach up and brush it away from your

02:52:35.216 --> 02:52:40.344
nose. As your finger presses against it, it's much
sturdier than a spider web. It's a metallic wire,

02:52:40.344 --> 02:52:50.921
and as you push away (tink). You hear that slight
noise. Tiberius, behind you, you hear a grinding

02:52:50.921 --> 02:53:00.943
of stone, and a loud slam sounds, like something
extremely heavy just dropped behind you.

02:53:00.943 --> 02:53:02.590
MARISHA: Run!

02:53:02.590 --> 02:53:06.859
MATT: You guys glance over your shoulder and you
see what looks to be a fairly rounded boulder--

02:53:06.859 --> 02:53:12.400
ORION: I dispel Alter Self immediately so I have
longer-ass legs.

02:53:12.400 --> 02:53:15.840
MATT: Well, Alter Self is gone if you're casting
Stoneskin, because that's a concentration spell.

02:53:15.840 --> 02:53:20.371
Oh, that. But that only carries it for a few
rounds. It's been a longer time than that.

02:53:20.371 --> 02:53:24.571
ORION: It's been 15 minutes. Time has passed.
Never mind. I don't do shit.

02:53:24.571 --> 02:53:27.483
MATT: But yeah, don't worry about that. But the
stone boulder just--

02:53:27.483 --> 02:53:29.338
MARISHA: Indiana Jones, motherfuckers!

02:53:29.338 --> 02:53:36.500
MATT: Picking up speed with the slow decline of
this room. All of you guys, what are you doing?

02:53:36.500 --> 02:53:38.409
ALL: Run!

02:53:38.409 --> 02:53:40.070
MATT: You're bolting forward.

02:53:40.070 --> 02:53:42.069
ORION: I cast Fly on myself and fly.

02:53:42.069 --> 02:53:50.160
MATT: You cast Fly, pushing forward, and you guys
get a little speed, but you've noticed the

02:53:50.160 --> 02:53:54.780
boulder's started to gather steam as it continues
down, and the pathway you guys are running is

02:53:54.780 --> 02:53:58.791
going at a heavier and heavier decline as you push
forward.

02:53:58.791 --> 02:54:04.666
ORION: Oh! As I'm flying, I turn around with my
ring and I cast Slow on the boulder.

02:54:04.666 --> 02:54:14.727
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and make a-- actually, no.
This is interesting. Let me see if Slow would have

02:54:14.727 --> 02:54:24.568
a direct effect on this boulder. That's something
that happens right now that I didn't consider. I

02:54:24.568 --> 02:54:29.957
love when that happens. Unfortunately, it is not a
creature and actually it affects the physical

02:54:29.957 --> 02:54:36.929
metabolism and muscle use of an individual. This
is just a solid structured object. As you release

02:54:36.929 --> 02:54:42.097
the spell, you see the air around it poof, and
drift a little slower, and the boulder seems to

02:54:42.097 --> 02:54:47.865
stutter for a moment, but continues to push
forward. That was your action.

02:54:47.865 --> 02:54:49.824
ORION: Damn it.

02:54:49.824 --> 02:54:54.369
LIAM: I would like to cast all of my spells in
succession for the next ten minutes.

02:54:54.369 --> 02:54:59.635
MATT: I assume you're going full sprint? Okay, so
pushing forward, you all push forward, Tiberius

02:54:59.635 --> 02:55:03.781
who has stopped to turn around and cast the spell
is not at a full dash, so he trails behind. The

02:55:03.781 --> 02:55:05.929
boulder is currently gaining on Tiberius.

02:55:05.929 --> 02:55:07.667
ORION: I Gandalf it.

02:55:07.667 --> 02:55:13.210
MATT: So you turn around. You're continuing to fly
forward. So you guys just turn to push forward.

02:55:13.210 --> 02:55:16.655
Tiberius, the boulder is nearly upon you now. What
are you going to do?

02:55:16.655 --> 02:55:22.713
ORION: Oh! Awesome. Is it at least ten to 15 feet
away from me?

02:55:22.713 --> 02:55:26.005
MATT: It is about ten to five feet away from you,
you can see it cresting--

02:55:26.005 --> 02:55:32.997
ORION: Sweet. As I'm now frustrated, I cast a
5th-level spell, and I will cast my Obelisk of

02:55:32.997 --> 02:55:36.613
Iron, three in a row behind me.

02:55:36.613 --> 02:55:41.411
MATT: Okay. All right. You burned that spell. All
of a sudden, the room behind you, out of the

02:55:41.411 --> 02:55:47.028
stone, pockets of iron ore or whatever material is
beneath the earth behind you is brought together

02:55:47.028 --> 02:55:51.779
into a liquid mass and then shoots up in the
center of the hallway behind you. With each one of

02:55:51.779 --> 02:55:54.713
these pillars slamming into the wall, you guys
hear these three multiple explosions behind you,

02:55:54.713 --> 02:56:00.607
and for a brief second you fear the worst for
Tiberius' current status. Immediately following

02:56:00.607 --> 02:56:05.943
that, you hear the impact of stone against iron,
and you see the obelisks bend with this horrible

02:56:05.943 --> 02:56:07.898
creaking sound.

02:56:07.898 --> 02:56:09.423
MARISHA: Keep running!

02:56:09.423 --> 02:56:11.843
ORION: That should stop it right there.

02:56:11.843 --> 02:56:13.324
MARISHA: I don't know.

02:56:13.324 --> 02:56:16.182
MATT: The sound of the rolling has stopped.

02:56:16.182 --> 02:56:20.606
MARISHA: I still don't trust it. Let's just all
get out of this hole.

02:56:20.606 --> 02:56:25.899
ORION: I keep Gandalfing.

02:56:25.899 --> 02:56:27.898
MARISHA: It could give way at any moment.

02:56:27.898 --> 02:56:29.678
LIAM: Let's walk. Shall we walk? I think we should
walk.

02:56:29.678 --> 02:56:31.259
WIL: I like to walk.

02:56:31.259 --> 02:56:40.144
MATT: Okay. You guys continue moving forward, the
decline getting a little more difficult to

02:56:40.144 --> 02:56:44.548
traverse as your feel yourselves now having to
feel your arms across the wall or use it for

02:56:44.548 --> 02:56:49.789
balance to make sure you don't just fall. Also,
the moisture in the air begins to grow more and

02:56:49.789 --> 02:56:57.287
more thick. Some source of liquid some point down
in the future has permeated what was originally

02:56:57.287 --> 02:57:05.162
dusty, dry air with liquid of some kind, and the
air itself grows more and more rancid in scent. It

02:57:05.162 --> 02:57:11.597
smells like refuse or rot. It's hard to describe,
and it's old. It's musky, it's terrible, and it

02:57:11.597 --> 02:57:16.589
grows stronger the farther you go. As you continue
pushing forward, you also feel that the dusty

02:57:16.589 --> 02:57:19.243
ground is becoming more and more mud-like.

02:57:19.243 --> 02:57:22.855
WIL: Is it making my hair poof out and look
stupid?

02:57:22.855 --> 02:57:27.500
MATT: A little bit, yeah. You spent all morning
treating it and it's undoing everything you did.

02:57:27.500 --> 02:57:30.018
WIL: This is why I lived in the mountains.

02:57:30.018 --> 02:57:35.475
WILL: Is there any light? Any light source?
There's no natural light? We're not walking

02:57:35.475 --> 02:57:36.818
towards any type of light?

02:57:36.818 --> 02:57:38.889
MATT: It's just a tunnel into darkness right now.

02:57:38.889 --> 02:57:40.875
MARISHA: Does there appear to be any type of plant
life?

02:57:40.875 --> 02:57:47.606
MATT: From what you can tell, there is no plant
life at all whatsoever. The moisture gathered on

02:57:47.606 --> 02:57:53.471
the walls you can now see are dripping. The
condensation has given this tunnel more of a

02:57:53.471 --> 02:57:58.109
mineral-pocketed look, and the ground is getting
more sludgy with each step.

02:57:58.109 --> 02:58:01.395
WIL: I want to make a-- I'm sorry, you're not
done.

02:58:01.395 --> 02:58:08.714
MARISHA: I was just going to ask: are the walls
stone or chiseled-out rock?

02:58:08.714 --> 02:58:15.517
MATT: It feels like it's chiseled-out, hard earth
that has been packed and supported with either

02:58:15.517 --> 02:58:21.335
small wooden things that are inset to make sure it
doesn't collapse at some point, a lot of that has

02:58:21.335 --> 02:58:23.079
either fallen through.

02:58:23.079 --> 02:58:25.485
WILL: So it could collapse at any time.

02:58:25.485 --> 02:58:29.481
MATT: Well, if you do any severe damage to its
structure. It would probably be a bad idea.

02:58:29.481 --> 02:58:31.283
MARISHA: Right, like drop a boulder down it.

02:58:31.283 --> 02:58:32.830
MATT: It's not a mine shaft.

02:58:32.830 --> 02:58:34.922
MARISHA: What were you going to say?

02:58:34.922 --> 02:58:40.008
WIL: I would like to make a-- you tell me what
check it is. What I want to do is to look down

02:58:40.008 --> 02:58:49.538
into this thick mud stuff. What I'm looking for
are tracks, and if I do well enough, I want to see

02:58:49.538 --> 02:58:55.734
if I can get a sense of how fast the thing was
going. Has it slowed down because it's

02:58:55.734 --> 02:58:57.623
comfortable, or is it still running?

02:58:57.623 --> 02:59:00.925
MATT: Okay, make another survival check.

02:59:00.925 --> 02:59:03.913
WIL: So I'm underground.

02:59:03.913 --> 02:59:09.016
MATT: Actually, as a dwarf I'll give you advantage
on that, so roll again. That makes sense, this is

02:59:09.016 --> 02:59:11.895
your place.

02:59:11.895 --> 02:59:17.868
LIAM: Well, the higher one was four. The lower one
was a one.

02:59:17.868 --> 02:59:19.908
WILL: The higher one was a four?

02:59:19.908 --> 02:59:24.001
WIL: Remember what I told you about the Wheaton
dice curse? I'm sorry. Because no one will believe

02:59:24.001 --> 02:59:26.887
me. No one ever believes me.

02:59:26.887 --> 02:59:30.218
MARISHA: He's been taking pictures of all his
fails so everyone believes it.

02:59:30.218 --> 02:59:35.992
WILL: At this point, I'd be amazed that he hasn't
helped us in any way, shape, or form, and cast a

02:59:35.992 --> 02:59:37.871
perception check of my own.

02:59:37.871 --> 02:59:39.023
MATT: Sure.

02:59:39.023 --> 02:59:47.861
WILL: There we go. So let's see, we are at 21.

02:59:47.861 --> 02:59:49.383
MATT: 21, okay.

02:59:49.383 --> 02:59:52.769
WILL: You are useless. For the love of god.

02:59:52.769 --> 02:59:57.041
MATT: As a pre-existing member of the Slayer's
Take and the man who was currently set to be the

02:59:57.041 --> 03:00:01.938
leader of your group, you're beginning to wonder
if this guild is the kind of thing you really want

03:00:01.938 --> 03:00:03.999
to be joining, at this point.

03:00:03.999 --> 03:00:05.890
WIL: I haven't been in a fight yet.

03:00:05.890 --> 03:00:12.884
MATT: True. But looking down you can see there are
no tracks, actually. This line has not been

03:00:12.884 --> 03:00:18.939
traversed in quite some time, and the smoothness
of it says that whatever came through here did not

03:00:18.939 --> 03:00:20.404
leave any footprints.

03:00:20.404 --> 03:00:21.364
WILL: At all?

03:00:21.364 --> 03:00:26.855
MATT: No. Also, as you guys continue, you reach a
point where, especially with your heavy armor-- go

03:00:26.855 --> 03:00:29.034
ahead and make a dexterity saving throw.

03:00:29.034 --> 03:00:30.488
MARISHA: Oh no.

03:00:30.488 --> 03:00:31.893
LIAM: You got this.

03:00:31.893 --> 03:00:34.230
WILL: Ten. So wait. 13.

03:00:34.230 --> 03:00:42.341
MATT: 13? Okay. You're stepping forward, keeping
an eye out, and you look back at the group and

03:00:42.341 --> 03:00:50.148
take a step and your foot slips out from under
you. (smack) You hit the slime and begin to slide

03:00:50.148 --> 03:00:57.017
down the tunnel as part of the decline. You guys
watch as your cleric Goonies-style slide vanishes

03:00:57.017 --> 03:00:58.393
into the darkness.

03:00:58.393 --> 03:01:00.178
WILL: It's our time. It's our time down here.

03:01:00.178 --> 03:01:02.535
WIL: Hey, you guys!

03:01:02.535 --> 03:01:09.072
MATT: Kashaw has vanished into the darkness and
you hear, (screams).

03:01:09.072 --> 03:01:11.147
WILL: (screams)

03:01:11.147 --> 03:01:15.737
ORION: As I see this happening, I run over and go
like, this looks like a lot of fun!

03:01:15.737 --> 03:01:17.636
MATT: As you lunge through the air, because you're
flying, still.

03:01:17.636 --> 03:01:22.728
ORION: Oh. Has ten minutes passed? I thought ten
minutes? It only lasts for like ten minutes.

03:01:22.728 --> 03:01:25.779
MATT: Oh, then yeah, it's faded. So you just slide
after?

03:01:25.779 --> 03:01:28.519
ORION: Yeah, I go, this looks like a lot of fun.
And I go and I slide.

03:01:28.519 --> 03:01:31.294
MATT: Tiberius slides after, body first across the
slime.

03:01:31.294 --> 03:01:35.134
MARISHA: And then I see Tiberius go and I go,
(whoops). And I go, too.

03:01:35.134 --> 03:01:40.014
MATT: All right. Three of your party have just
vanished into the darkness, hoping that fate will

03:01:40.014 --> 03:01:42.396
take them to some place of pillows and feathers.

03:01:42.396 --> 03:01:45.304
LIAM: I think I'd rather walk as long as I can.

03:01:45.304 --> 03:01:46.995
WIL: I think I'm with you.

03:01:46.995 --> 03:01:56.706
MATT: All right. You guys both make dexterity
saving throws.

03:01:56.706 --> 03:02:00.594
WIL: 16.

03:02:00.594 --> 03:02:02.293
LIAM: 16.

03:02:02.293 --> 03:02:07.205
MATT: Wow. You manage to slowly make your way down
this tunnel, almost-- what's that?

03:02:07.205 --> 03:02:09.158
ORION: My dex was 18, by the way.

03:02:09.158 --> 03:02:13.119
MATT: It doesn't matter; you jumped into this. You
intentionally fell.

03:02:13.119 --> 03:02:15.975
LIAM: We can't even hear you anymore. You're miles
away.

03:02:15.975 --> 03:02:18.498
MATT: Yeah. You guys slowly begin to make your way
down the tunnel, as you can't even hear them

03:02:18.498 --> 03:02:22.849
anymore. You guys, one after another, sliding down
the slide and grime going past you. You smell in

03:02:22.849 --> 03:02:30.031
the air what smells like vegetable matter that's
been long, long falling in compost, along with

03:02:30.031 --> 03:02:38.049
what smells like rancid feces mixed with mold.
It's this terrible continuously growing scent.

03:02:38.049 --> 03:02:40.620
ORION: I put up my nose scales.

03:02:40.620 --> 03:02:45.365
MATT: Until eventually, out of the darkness,
because you're ahead of everyone, you're outside

03:02:45.365 --> 03:02:49.367
of the range of his Light spell, the slime stops
and there's just air.

03:02:49.367 --> 03:02:52.276
LIAM: Hey, you guys!

03:02:52.276 --> 03:03:04.614
MATT: And a few moments of this air rushing past
you as you're immediately stopped with a wet sound

03:03:04.614 --> 03:03:13.816
as you impact hard into some sort of heavy spongy
matter. Thankfully, because it's spongy, you only

03:03:13.816 --> 03:03:19.675
suffer four points of damage, so you can mark that
somewhere on the sheet. Mainly just from the way

03:03:19.675 --> 03:03:24.456
you landed and your armor sticks into where the
plates are and just the impact was bad for your

03:03:24.456 --> 03:03:30.516
body. But you're now in darkness, looking up,
sitting on what feels like you're on some sort of

03:03:30.516 --> 03:03:35.293
strange compost heap. Looking up, you see in the
darkness this small light begin to appear, and you

03:03:35.293 --> 03:03:37.855
see this dragonborn--

03:03:37.855 --> 03:03:40.040
ORION: I'm laughing, by the way.

03:03:40.040 --> 03:03:42.601
WILL: Can I try to move, since I hear him
laughing, can I try to move out of the way?

03:03:42.601 --> 03:03:47.097
MATT: You roll out of the way as the two of you
scream down. With the light that now shines you

03:03:47.097 --> 03:03:51.277
can see this is a cylindrical cistern of some
kind. It is a tunnel that is very tall, and you

03:03:51.277 --> 03:03:55.040
both impact into the same heap.

03:03:55.040 --> 03:03:57.739
LIAM: Shitter's full!

03:03:57.739 --> 03:04:07.656
ORION: As we land, I look around. Oh, that was a
lot of fun. I cast Prestidigitation three times in

03:04:07.656 --> 03:04:09.187
a row and clean us all up.

03:04:09.187 --> 03:04:14.270
MATT: You try and clean what you can, but you guys
are like knee to nearly waist deep as you get up

03:04:14.270 --> 03:04:15.357
and move around--

03:04:15.357 --> 03:04:16.671
ORION: Or at least our faces.

03:04:16.671 --> 03:04:18.038
MATT: Your faces are clean.

03:04:18.038 --> 03:04:19.852
WILL: What a wonderful smell you've discovered.

03:04:19.852 --> 03:04:25.197
MATT: And it's a terrible smell. This room is
quite honestly a mixture of long-rotting food, of

03:04:25.197 --> 03:04:30.180
dried vegetation that has been discarded here for
whatever reason, a lot of it's hay and thatch that

03:04:30.180 --> 03:04:36.881
has been just rotting and molding for god knows
how many years, and quite honestly, feces from

03:04:36.881 --> 03:04:38.651
some indeterminate entity.

03:04:38.651 --> 03:04:45.742
MARISHA: I use my Druidcraft to take out some of
my sage and light it

03:04:45.742 --> 03:04:49.038
and spread some of my sage around.

03:04:49.038 --> 03:04:57.457
ORION: You're making it worse. Now it's smoky and
smells. Prestidigitate it out of my face.

03:04:57.457 --> 03:05:01.332
MATT: As you guys are doing this, you guys are
making your way down the tunnel. And you have a

03:05:01.332 --> 03:05:08.248
ways to catch up to them, you do hear (squeaking).
You hear this, and as you look around with the

03:05:08.248 --> 03:05:12.928
light you can see little bits of movement leaping
through this heap.

03:05:12.928 --> 03:05:15.585
LIAM: Rat horde.

03:05:15.585 --> 03:05:17.952
WILL: Rats are going to be wonderful.

03:05:17.952 --> 03:05:25.271
MATT: Then suddenly, thrusting out of some of this
heap, you see a large arm or tendril, brownish-tan

03:05:25.271 --> 03:05:29.212
in color just slams onto the side of it.

03:05:29.212 --> 03:05:32.449
ORION: Oh shit. I go invisible.

03:05:32.449 --> 03:05:36.990
WILL: You've got to help-- where the hell did he
go?

03:05:36.990 --> 03:05:41.057
MATT: At which point you now see emerging from it
two of these giant tendrils, which at the end are

03:05:41.057 --> 03:05:47.197
covered in these long, teeth-like spines, grasping
the sides of this stone cylinder, pulling itself

03:05:47.197 --> 03:05:51.088
out of the refuse, shaking as it pulls itself
forward. You now see the body that contains it

03:05:51.088 --> 03:05:56.312
with one third central tendril that rises up, what
looks like creepy eyes or nose-holes that are

03:05:56.312 --> 03:06:01.923
looking around and glancing at both of you, and
you see emerging beneath that the body, this

03:06:01.923 --> 03:06:09.706
large, eight- to ten-foot-thick, wide,
covered-in-slime body that is this gargantuan

03:06:09.821 --> 03:06:16.669
toothy maw that opens up with a tongue that lolls
out. And that's where we're going to go ahead and

03:06:16.669 --> 03:06:25.493
end today's session. We'll pick it up next week
right where we left off. You guys slowly making

03:06:25.493 --> 03:06:27.716
your way down the tunnel. We'll pick up with that
next time.

03:06:27.716 --> 03:06:31.056
WILL: Toothy maw is where we end it!

03:06:31.056 --> 03:06:33.377
MATT: Yep. Toothy maw.

03:06:33.377 --> 03:06:36.381
MARISHA: Tentacley, brown, twitchy eyeball, toothy
maw. That's all we know?

03:06:36.381 --> 03:06:41.117
MATT: That's all you know. And some sort of
strange sound and other small things moving.

03:06:41.117 --> 03:06:43.309
WIL: Do you give out prizes for the most ones
rolled in a night,

03:06:43.309 --> 03:06:45.175
because I'm pretty sure I won that.

03:06:45.175 --> 03:06:48.466
MATT: I do, and for that prize I give you a fancy
yellow d20.

03:06:48.466 --> 03:06:55.588
WIL: Oh! Thank you. That's great. Does it have all
ones on it?

03:06:55.588 --> 03:06:59.575
MATT: Shit. Yeah. How did that happen?

03:06:59.575 --> 03:07:02.161
MARISHA: Oh, that's been your problem the whole
time.

03:07:02.161 --> 03:07:05.093
LIAM: Congratulations, you've won imploding
self-esteem.

03:07:05.093 --> 03:07:15.267
WIL: That stacks, right? I already have that. I
mean, it would be silly if I couldn't-- is that an

03:07:15.267 --> 03:07:20.435
ongoing? Because that's a feat I took when I
started.

03:07:20.435 --> 03:07:23.931
MATT: Yeah, yeah, I tried to tell you not to take
that but, you know, character flavor is

03:07:23.931 --> 03:07:25.234
important.

03:07:25.234 --> 03:07:28.946
WIL: Listen, it's a class feature. It's an actor's
class feature.

03:07:28.946 --> 03:07:31.766
LIAM: After enough time, you can suck people into
it.

03:07:31.766 --> 03:07:39.211
MATT: Well, guys, thank you so much!

03:07:39.211 --> 03:07:41.412
WIL: Thanks, Matt. That was amazing.

03:07:41.412 --> 03:07:44.477
MATT: That was a fun first round. Got one more
session with you guys.

03:07:44.477 --> 03:07:46.504
MARISHA: Yes, and what did you think of your first
game?

03:07:46.504 --> 03:07:50.576
WILL: It was incredible, nothing should be this
fun. Seriously, it was so much fun.

03:07:50.576 --> 03:07:52.192
Yeah. Awesome.

03:07:52.192 --> 03:07:56.442
MATT: Well guys, thank you, I'm so glad you could
join us and I'm excited for next week. And thank

03:07:56.442 --> 03:08:01.549
you guys for tuning in, hope you're enjoying it as
much as we are. We can't stay too long,

03:08:01.549 --> 03:08:06.822
unfortunately, I have a flight to catch very soon

03:12:32.548 --> 03:12:38.941
ZAC: Thank you everybody for helping us get to 6k.
They've already started a stupid e-mail chain

03:12:38.941 --> 03:12:41.376
talking about what musical songs they're going to
sing.

03:12:41.376 --> 03:12:47.586

Elizabeth came back to visit and watch.

STEVE: I'm just going to troll. Hi.

03:13:01.074 --> 03:13:03.297

incredible time, looking forward to the session

03:13:19.125 --> 03:13:20.997
you guys want to bust out tonight?

03:13:20.997 --> 03:13:22.913
MARISHA: I don't want to wait a week.

03:13:22.913 --> 03:13:30.741
WIL: Really fun and really weird to be on this
side of that screen. So odd for me, and just to

03:13:30.741 --> 03:13:36.530
play a character who's so different from the
characters I used to play before I DMed all the

03:13:36.530 --> 03:13:42.167
time. It's weird to be a guy who just doesn't
think about stuff and like is not particularly

03:13:42.167 --> 03:13:51.138
charismatic and anyway, people who have thought
about playing or want to play RPGs, when we were

03:13:51.138 --> 03:13:55.786
rolling up this guy, I was so excited when I got--
what did I roll for him? Anyway he's got a minus

03:13:55.786 --> 03:14:01.780
one. I rolled an eight for his charisma, and I was
so excited because I was like, well now I know

03:14:01.780 --> 03:14:07.504
exactly who this guy is. I know exactly who he is
and it's going to be really fun to be him. It was

03:14:07.504 --> 03:14:12.382
really great, it was really fun to come and I
found out about your game because Liam directed me

03:14:12.382 --> 03:14:17.136
in a voice session. I want to be on your show so
much.

03:14:17.136 --> 03:14:22.061
MATT: Well, now it is done. Dreams do come true.
Then we smash them.

03:14:22.061 --> 03:14:25.185
WILL: Now roll a one and get us out of here.

03:14:25.185 --> 03:14:31.219
WIL: I'll try, but since it's not going to count,
I don't know.

03:14:31.219 --> 03:14:32.821
LIAM: It'll be a 20. 19.

03:14:32.821 --> 03:14:36.076
(laughter)

03:14:36.076 --> 03:14:42.501
MATT: Thanks so much. We'll see you next week, 7PM
on the Twitch stream. Have a wonderful week.

03:14:42.501 --> 03:14:44.776
MARISHA: Bye!
