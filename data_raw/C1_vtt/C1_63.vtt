(laughing)

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:39.300
MATT: And welcome back to tonight's episode.
So, picking up where we left off, Vox Machina,

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:44.970
having to find and collect the artifacts known as
the Vestiges of Divergence to prepare themselves

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:50.460
for battle against the Chroma Conclave, a group of
extremely dangerous chromatic dragons who are

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:57.430
wreaking havoc on the Tal'Dorei countryside,
and get vengeance for the loss of Vex and Vax's

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:01.380
father in the past. Er, sorry, mother. The
father's still around, and kind of a dick.

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:02.330
LAURA: Yeah.

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:07.610
MATT: It's been a long week. However, you guys
have been making your way into the Feywild in

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:13.810
search of a specific item known as Fenthras,
a bow of which Vex has been sort of keeping an

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:14.910
eye on this whole time.

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:16.130
LAURA: Ahh, totally.

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:23.690
MATT: Just like that. (laughs) We're all having
Gen Con plague residual, here. They've made their

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:28.470
way through a number of strange, dangerous,
and awkward encounters in the Feywild, including

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.720
an encounter with their father, I meant to say
earlier, in Syngorn, which is currently hiding out

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:36.450
in the Feywild until they've prepared for battle
against Thordak the Cinder King. You went to the

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:42.480
Moonbrush and parleyed between pixies and
werewolves, you pushed past the Gilded Run,

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:47.130
a series of enchanted, dangerous rivers that keep
the Shademirk Bog in check from spreading across

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:52.530
the land with its corruption, and you stepped into
the Shademirk Bog, its strange, sludgey, black,

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:59.680
corrupt interior, stumbling upon what appears to
be a small hovel built out of a tree trunk.

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:06.270
The gnomes, making their way towards via Vex's
broom, caught a partial glimpse of the creature

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:10.810
that lived within, a door was suddenly opened,
and upon floating back, the broom was robbed of

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:17.030
its magical enchantment temporarily. The party
regathered and are now deciding what to do here in

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:21.980
the depths of the Shademirk Bog. So, as the gnomes
have returned, your broom has seemingly been

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:23.610
proven to still function--

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:25.270
LAURA: Don't say 'seemingly'.

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.930
MATT: Why? It's fun.

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:26.500
LAURA: Don't say 'seemingly'.

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:27.420
MATT: It's fun.

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:28.440
MARISHA: We confirmed.

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:29.640
LAURA: Yeah.

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.090
MATT: What would you guys like to do?

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:34.260
SAM: All right, so that place over there,
the hut.

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:35.670
LAURA: Yeah.

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:39.560
SAM: I think it was not a good idea to go over
there. I think it's one of the things that

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.440
what's-his-fuck warned us about.

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:42.270
LAURA: Garmelie?

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.890
SAM: Yes.

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:44.000
LAURA: The hag, right?

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.680
SAM: I don't know. I wasn't really paying
attention.

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:46.980
LAURA: Yeah, no, he warned us about...

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.000
TALIESIN: I'm feeling the hag. Is anybody else
feeling the hag?

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.940
SAM: Something about a hut.

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:51.150
LAURA: I am not feeling the hag.

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:52.570
LIAM: I'm not feeling the hag.

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:54.070
MARISHA: How do you mean? Yeah, how do you mean,
feeling?

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:55.190
LIAM: I've had enough hag.

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:56.540
TALIESIN: We're not feeling the hag, but I think
we should avoid her.

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:58.740
LAURA: The Hut of Wodenna.

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:00.100
MARISHA: The Hut of Wodenna, right.

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:01.300
SAM: Yeah, that's probably Wodenna.

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:02.470
LAURA: It could be.

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:07.500
SAM: So why don't we go around the hut? Is that
possible? Is Garmelie gone?

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:08.250
LAURA: Garmelie's gone.

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:09.500
MATT: Garmelie left, you guys.

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:10.190
SAM: Oh yeah.

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.750
TRAVIS: Peaced out.

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:11.570
MATT: He wouldn't even enter the forest with you.

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:13.650
LAURA: However, she is aware of our presence, now,
isn't she?

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:16.080
SAM: So? We're big and scary. She's a little old
lady.

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:20.510
LIAM: What's the terrain like around this hut?

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:27.140
MATT: The forests of the Shademirk Bog is a very
very thickly wooded swamp with thick-trunked trees

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:35.830
and almost weeping willow-type sagging canopies,
but the entirety of each piece of brush here is

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:42.440
coated and seemingly seeping this kind of black
sticky tar-like ichor that just kind of pools and

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:48.470
seeps into the ground, so even traversing this
territory's been a slow, arduous process.

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:56.660
There is a small clearing around where this tree
trunk hovel is currently located, and the tree

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:01.090
itself does not appear to match the surrounding
trees

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:04.310
that kind of embody most of this forest
terrain.

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:07.200
LIAM: Does it look possible to skirt around it
from where we are?

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:10.000
MATT: You could skirt around it, most definitely,
yeah. It's just something you saw in the distance

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.570
and went and inspected, you could avoid it
entirely.

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:12.470
LIAM: Okay.

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:13.950
TALIESIN: And we do have a direction to move.

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:17.430
LAURA: Yeah, we know, we know that is not where
the bow is.

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:20.710
MARISHA: Yes, it was on Garmelie's list of things
to avoid.

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:22.990
SAM: But maybe she could help us in a way.

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:27.000
LAURA: I know, it's so terrible! I want to like
explore everything here because--

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.230
MARISHA: I wonder if she knows the other hags that
we've encountered.

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:31.280
LAURA: Forsythia...

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:35.920
SAM: It's like that urge when you're standing at
the edge of a cliff, like part of your body wants

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:37.300
to jump a little bit?

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:37.990
LAURA: Yeah.

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:39.020
SAM: I kinda wanna go in there.

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:40.120
LAURA: Kind of like when I dove into the river.

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:40.750
SAM: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:41.660
MATT: Yeah, exactly.

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:44.670
MARISHA: Well, see, you guys did kind of jump,
and it didn't feel good, right?

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:45.470
LAURA: Right, true.

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:46.300
TRAVIS: Devil's advocate.

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:47.310
MARISHA: So...

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:53.470
TRAVIS: What if she's lonely, and two, what if
she's not the hag and she knows where the hag is?

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:58.710
MARISHA: One, I'm certain she is lonely, and two,
she's probably the hag.

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:00.180
TALIESIN: I'm pretty sure she's the hag.

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:01.630
MARISHA: She's definitely probably the hag.

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:06.040
LIAM: We've kind of already had this conversation
before we went and poked a badger with those

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:09.510
floating instruments, we really don't need to do
every single thing.

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:11.010
LAURA: No, we don't, we really don't.

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:12.350
TRAVIS: I'm just saying you're profiling, is all.

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:14.320
LIAM: And I have a bad history with hags,
and I would like--

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:15.400
LAURA: Yes, you do.

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:16.860
LIAM: --to skip this fucking place.

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:21.530
TALIESIN: I'm okay with that. I, honestly I could
use a bit of sleep at some point and I think

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:24.740
moving in the correct direction, getting a bit of
sleep somewhere safe...

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:28.140
LAURA: And we've been do-si-doing the whole time
we've been having this conversation, definitely.

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:29.910
TALIESIN: I'm working on that as well.

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:31.670
MARISHA: I feel like we're trying to talk
ourselves out of this, aren't we?

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:33.930
LAURA: I think we need to not go towards the hut.

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:35.930
MARISHA: Okay, we'll not go towards the hut.

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:37.180
LAURA: To the tree, to scariness.

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:39.010
TALIESIN: If there was a time to not be us,
this is the moment.

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:39.650
MARISHA: It's probably now.

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:40.690
LAURA: This is that time.

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:41.420
TALIESIN: Right now.

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:42.240
TRAVIS: I take out the javelin of lightning.

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:43.130
ALL: No!

00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:45.590
SAM: You have a javelin of lightning?

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:46.230
LAURA: He does.

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:47.240
TRAVIS: I do.

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:48.220
TALIESIN: He does, in fact, have a javelin of
lightning.

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:49.320
SAM: Why have you never used a javelin of
lightning?

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:50.960
LAURA: He has, he has one time. Don't.

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:53.220
TRAVIS: And I, I just make sure that it's clean
and put it back.

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:54.320
MATT: Okay.

00:06:54.320 --> 00:07:01.050
LAURA: Let's just sneakily go off and just not pay
any more attention to this charming little tree.

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:02.160
MARISHA: Okay.

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:04.390
TALIESIN: I feel like we've done enough damage for
one day.

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:06.730
TRAVIS: Yeah, we've gotta at least come back this
way, so, you know.

00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:08.590
LAURA: This is true. Ugh.

00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:10.600
MATT: All righty. You guys--

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:12.390
TRAVIS: We go around. Stealthily.

00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:16.010
LAURA: Stealthily walk away from the hut.

00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:18.330
TRAVIS: Do we still have Pass Without a Trace?

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:20.710
LAURA: Do we still have Pass Without a Trace
going, or do I need--no, it dropped, it dropped.

00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:22.230
MATT: You traveled quite a while, yeah.

00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:27.920
LAURA: Because we fought something, so I would
need to cast it again. Which I do! Cast again.

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:29.300
Pass Without a Trace.

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:30.660
SAM: Thank you!

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:33.050
LAURA: Um, maybe Dust of Tracelessness behind us
so the hag

00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:35.250
doesn't feel tempted to maybe follow in
our footsteps.

00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:37.800
TRAVIS: Don't tell me what to do, devil-woman.

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:42.420
TRAVIS: I take out the Dust of Tracelessness.
It looks good, I put it back.

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:45.490
LAURA: Grog, please, flower-girl, please.

00:07:45.490 --> 00:07:52.650
TRAVIS: Javelin or Dust of Tracelessness,
they go together. If I do one, I do the other.

00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:54.040
LAURA: You're terrible. That's terrible.

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:56.560
TRAVIS: I need a little danger in my life.

00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:58.960
TALIESIN: I promise you, we're going to kill
something very soon.

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:00.060
LAURA: Soon!

00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:01.400
TRAVIS: There's a giant werewolf following us...

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:03.890
LAURA: We just killed the crocodile plant.
We just killed a crocodile plant.

00:08:03.890 --> 00:08:04.890
MARISHA: That's true.

00:08:04.890 --> 00:08:06.490
LAURA: Seriously, we just fought something.

00:08:06.490 --> 00:08:08.550
MARISHA: You were inside his gut. You have to
remember that.

00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:09.780
LAURA: Just did that.

00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:11.170
TRAVIS: I didn't really hit it that much,
it was very unsatisfying.

00:08:11.170 --> 00:08:12.980
(All laugh.)

00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:15.210
LAURA: Let's walk away.

00:08:15.210 --> 00:08:16.650
LAURA: I wanna stealth.

00:08:16.650 --> 00:08:19.230
MATT: All right. Everyone make a stealth check.

00:08:19.230 --> 00:08:21.230
MARISHA: All right. New d20.

00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:23.010
LAURA: Oh, high hopes!

00:08:23.010 --> 00:08:24.940
TRAVIS: Did you say Pass Without a Trace?

00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:26.820
LAURA: Pass Without a Trace, I cast Pass Without a
Trace.

00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:28.090
TALIESIN: Huh. That's weird.

00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:30.110
MARISHA: That's a dick move. That is a--

00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:31.100
TALIESIN: That's weird.

00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:32.490
LAURA: Did you get a 20, did you get a 20 on it?

00:08:32.490 --> 00:08:33.160
TALIESIN: I got a 19.

00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:33.950
LAURA: Aw.

00:08:33.950 --> 00:08:35.660
MARISHA: He got a 19 and I got a three.

00:08:35.660 --> 00:08:36.430
LAURA: Oh, come on.

00:08:36.430 --> 00:08:37.500
(All laugh.)

00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:39.100
LAURA: That's just not cool.

00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:39.950
MATT: That's actually pretty funny.

00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:41.140
SAM: That's one better than before!

00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:41.990
MATT: Yeah.

00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:43.050
LIAM: Are these new opal dice?

00:08:43.050 --> 00:08:43.770
MARISHA: It's a step in the right direction.

00:08:43.770 --> 00:08:44.580
LAURA: They are.

00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:45.510
TRAVIS: They switched, yeah.

00:08:45.510 --> 00:08:46.460
SAM: New dice.

00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:48.360
LAURA: There's no excuse now.

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:49.340
MATT: All right, so.

00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:50.860
LAURA: I think it's just a curse on you, Marisha.

00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:51.580
MATT: Stealth.

00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:52.090
TRAVIS: 25.

00:08:52.090 --> 00:08:53.570
MATT: 25. Vax?

00:08:53.570 --> 00:08:54.790
LIAM: Did we use the Dust of Tracelessness?

00:08:54.790 --> 00:08:56.910
LAURA: No, we used Pass Without a Trace, though,
so add ten.

00:08:56.910 --> 00:08:59.510
LIAM: No? Well, I will settle for a 27.

00:08:59.510 --> 00:09:01.240
MATT: Okay, with a plus ten?

00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:02.470
LIAM: No, I, didn't we use--

00:09:02.470 --> 00:09:03.670
LAURA and TRAVIS: Pass Without a Trace.

00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:05.040
MATT: Pass Without a Trace was used.

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:06.030
LIAM: I just, oh, all right.

00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:07.100
LAURA and MATT: You said Dust of Tracelessness.

00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:07.700
LIAM: Oh, 37.

00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:09.620
MATT: Lotta traces going on, it's fine. Plus ten
added, so 37.

00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:10.330
LAURA: 36.

00:09:10.330 --> 00:09:11.090
MATT: 36.

00:09:11.090 --> 00:09:11.910
MARISHA: 20.

00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:12.800
TALIESIN: 35.

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:14.060
SAM: 30.

00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:15.310
MATT: All right, and Pike...

00:09:15.310 --> 00:09:16.310
LAURA: Pike!

00:09:16.310 --> 00:09:17.110
MATT: All right.

00:09:17.110 --> 00:09:18.470
(All laugh.)

00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:24.360
MATT: Ehhh, natural three. It's okay. You guys
make your way around the outskirts of this kind of

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:31.200
open glade area, scooting by. As you begin to
separate, finally getting to a point where the

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:39.370
direction you're trying to head, where you noticed
seemingly all the liquid that's seeping from,

00:09:39.370 --> 00:09:45.530
the actual movement, momentum of the horrible
black material was like pushing slowly outward

00:09:45.530 --> 00:09:51.570
from apparently some center place? You follow that
slow flow best you can. As you begin to pull away,

00:09:51.570 --> 00:09:57.000
you hear a slight creak sound in the distance.
(creaking)

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.090
LAURA: No. Can we see if the door shut?

00:09:59.090 --> 00:10:00.190
TRAVIS: Hide! I hide.

00:10:00.190 --> 00:10:01.050
LAURA: Did the door shut?

00:10:01.050 --> 00:10:02.340
MATT: Perception check.

00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:05.480
LIAM: Yeah, perception.

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:08.000
LAURA: Um. 25.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.250
MATT: You look back over your shoulder and notice
the door just (creaking, bang) and closes.

00:10:12.250 --> 00:10:12.810
LAURA: Okay.

00:10:12.810 --> 00:10:13.520
TRAVIS: Fuck.

00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:14.480
LAURA: No, that's...

00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:15.750
MATT: As it closes--

00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:16.530
TRAVIS: She's out here now.

00:10:16.530 --> 00:10:20.700
MATT: --there's a sudden flash of wind, and
there's a flicker in Pike's form as all of a

00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:22.180
sudden she (flickering sound)

00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:23.340
LAURA: No!

00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:24.500
PIKE: Guys?

00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:31.000
MATT: And her divine form vanishes in place,
apparently sent back to the source of where she

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:32.710
projected her essence.

00:10:32.710 --> 00:10:34.120
LAURA: She didn't get, like, stolen or something?

00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:35.500
LIAM: That is never not unsettling.

00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:36.560
LAURA: Away?

00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:39.760
MATT: Uh, not to your knowledge. It's similar to
the previous times that she's been unable to keep

00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:47.080
her form there for you. Especially between planes,
you can imagine it's been rather difficult for

00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:49.550
her to be here for the time she has.

00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:52.960
LAURA: Maybe the hag cast a Dispell she did on the
broom?

00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:55.120
MARISHA: Yeah, Dispell Magic.

00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:57.030
TALIESIN: Or maybe things just got strange.

00:10:57.030 --> 00:10:58.140
MARISHA: Poor reception.

00:10:58.140 --> 00:10:59.170
SAM: Something I said.

00:10:59.170 --> 00:11:00.170
LAURA: Love you, Pike.

00:11:00.170 --> 00:11:01.720
TRAVIS: Something you said. (laughs)

00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:05.310
LAURA: Definitely something you said.

00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:06.080
MARISHA: Okay.

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:07.420
MATT: All right.

00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:11.900
MARISHA: Can we see the hag moving
inside the hut through the window?

00:11:11.900 --> 00:11:14.670
MATT: You make a perception check as you're
glancing that way.

00:11:14.670 --> 00:11:15.970
TRAVIS: Can I look for Ukurat?

00:11:15.970 --> 00:11:18.830
MATT: Perception check.

00:11:18.830 --> 00:11:19.530
MARISHA: Oh my god.

00:11:19.530 --> 00:11:20.540
LAURA: Seriously?

00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:21.490
MARISHA: 14.

00:11:21.490 --> 00:11:25.490
MATT: 14? You see movement on the inside,
but no actual physical bead on an entity.

00:11:25.490 --> 00:11:27.930
You just see the light being broken in the
window.

00:11:27.930 --> 00:11:28.990
LAURA: Okay, so she's...

00:11:28.990 --> 00:11:29.890
MARISHA: Yeah, she's inside.

00:11:29.890 --> 00:11:30.930
LAURA: That's good.

00:11:30.930 --> 00:11:32.430
TRAVIS: A gigantic 11.

00:11:32.430 --> 00:11:33.720
SAM: You've yet to break single digits with them.

00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:34.710
TALIESIN: New die.

00:11:34.710 --> 00:11:38.180
MATT: You barely notice anything beyond the trees,
you have to remind yourself, oh, there's a house

00:11:38.180 --> 00:11:39.940
there. But.

00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:42.020
(Laura laughs.)

00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:44.160
TRAVIS: That sounds accurate.

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:45.970
MATT: Yeah.

00:11:45.970 --> 00:11:48.730
TRAVIS: Who are these people, like, (gasps).

00:11:48.730 --> 00:11:53.180
LAURA: Keyleth, what direction was the big scary
blight on the land?

00:11:53.180 --> 00:11:54.180
MARISHA: Northeast?

00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:54.990
SAM: Northwest.

00:11:54.990 --> 00:11:55.930
MATT: Northwest.

00:11:55.930 --> 00:11:57.280
MARISHA: Northwest. Northwest.

00:11:57.280 --> 00:11:58.450
LAURA: So we head that direction.

00:11:58.450 --> 00:11:59.890
MARISHA: This direction.

00:11:59.890 --> 00:12:01.810
MATT: All right. (laughs)

00:12:01.810 --> 00:12:03.040
MARISHA: This direction.

00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:07.590
MATT: Following Keyleth's lead, you guys begin to
slowly make your way through this bog and--

00:12:07.590 --> 00:12:10.330
LAURA: Keep an eye out for anything moving.

00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:12.990
MATT: Everything's slowly moving in its own right,
this kind of (sludgey sound)

00:12:12.990 --> 00:12:14.220
LAURA: Shit.

00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:15.790
TRAVIS: Easy there, tiger.

00:12:15.790 --> 00:12:17.020
MATT: Sliding of awful liquid.

00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:18.470
LAURA: Anything seemingly aggressive.

00:12:18.470 --> 00:12:19.570
MATT: Understood.

00:12:19.570 --> 00:12:21.800
TRAVIS: Don't shoot any trees.

00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:28.010
MATT: As you kind of push further, further
northward, you guys are having...

00:12:28.010 --> 00:12:29.450
do you have to sneeze?

00:12:29.450 --> 00:12:30.160
LAURA: It went away.

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:36.320
MATT: Okay, good. You get the sensation,
it's not even a sensation, the rest of the party

00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:40.380
-- aside from you-- you guys are getting knee-deep
in this liquid now, and it's to the point where

00:12:40.380 --> 00:12:45.330
you're having to take one step, lurch it out of
the liquid onto another, and you're having to go

00:12:45.330 --> 00:12:49.880
out of your way to kind of hug the edges of trees
where the roots themselves are protruding to give

00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:52.980
yourself some kind of foothold as opposed to
getting stuck in this bog. You, Scanlan,

00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:57.630
are having a particularly rough time trying to
walk on your own, because with each... though with

00:12:57.630 --> 00:13:00.840
your light form, it's a lot of strength to even
pull your

00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:04.970
little feet out of this tar-like substance. So.

00:13:04.970 --> 00:13:07.640
TRAVIS: Yeah, Pimps-a-lot, you wanna?

00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:09.030
SAM: Absolutely.

00:13:09.030 --> 00:13:09.860
TRAVIS: Okay.

00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:12.010
TRAVIS: Can I pick him up? And it's black stuff,
right?

00:13:12.010 --> 00:13:12.940
MATT: Yeah.

00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:14.540
TRAVIS: Can I smell the black stuff on him?

00:13:14.540 --> 00:13:18.760
MATT: Yeah, I mean, it permeates the area but it's
particularly strong at his feet and lower

00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:27.300
extremities, almost went up to his upper thighs.
It is a, it smells like a combination of wet

00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:34.540
blacktop, sulfur, and compost decay.

00:13:34.540 --> 00:13:36.880
TRAVIS: Yeah, in the summer?

00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:39.940
MATT: Yeah, like a hot, hot, Florida compost,
yeah.

00:13:39.940 --> 00:13:41.320
TRAVIS: I know that exact, accurate smell.

00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:43.270
MATT: Yeah. It's delightful.

00:13:43.270 --> 00:13:45.140
SAM: Drakkar.

00:13:45.140 --> 00:13:46.810
TRAVIS: You smell terrible.

00:13:46.810 --> 00:13:48.160
SAM: Sorry.

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:49.710
LAURA: That's a lot, coming from Grog.

00:13:49.710 --> 00:13:51.250
SAM: That is true.

00:13:51.250 --> 00:13:54.580
TRAVIS: How about you, I'll put you on my
shoulder, but how about you sit on my shoulder

00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:57.230
like strapped back there and just hang out the
back?

00:13:57.230 --> 00:13:58.800
SAM: Sit on your shoulder straps.

00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:03.230
TRAVIS: No, don't put your feet near my face,
like hang out on the back of me.

00:14:03.230 --> 00:14:05.390
SAM: All right, all right. Thank you for the
lift.

00:14:05.390 --> 00:14:07.890
TRAVIS: No worries.

00:14:07.890 --> 00:14:10.930
LAURA: It's good, you can keep an eye out for the
hag following behind us.

00:14:10.930 --> 00:14:11.990
SAM: That's good.

00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:14.190
SAM: Wait, am I like being Yoda-carried right
now?

00:14:14.190 --> 00:14:16.200
(All laugh.)

00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:17.430
LAURA: Yes.

00:14:17.430 --> 00:14:20.220
TRAVIS: I'm flipping and climbing vines and shit.

00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:25.600
MARISHA: Oh man, that makes me want a Scanlan
backpack. Oh man.

00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:31.180
MATT: Okay. As you guys push on forward,
Keyleth guiding the direction, you're the only

00:14:31.180 --> 00:14:34.950
one who moves without an issue. Are you tracking
ahead of the party, or are you staying with them?

00:14:34.950 --> 00:14:37.050
LAURA: I am tracking a little bit ahead of them.

00:14:37.050 --> 00:14:43.260
MATT: All right. You travel for about another hour
or so forward, and you, just being naturally alert

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:49.480
as you are, notice some shift of movement that is
more sudden than the slow sway of some of the

00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:55.100
various branches and boughs of nearby trees.
A little bit in the direction you're traveling

00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:56.400
and to the left.

00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:58.390
LAURA: What did it look like? Just movement?

00:14:58.390 --> 00:15:03.300
MATT: It moves again, and you see what appears to
be some almost large rock-like figure that's

00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:09.310
shifting, and the more you take a moment to focus,
it looks like a humanoid-type creature hunched

00:15:09.310 --> 00:15:12.650
over, facing away from you.

00:15:12.650 --> 00:15:17.050
LAURA: (mouthing) We should go, we should go that
way.

00:15:17.050 --> 00:15:21.040
LAURA: Can I point everybody to go around,
keeping a wide berth?

00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:22.150
MATT: Okay.

00:15:22.150 --> 00:15:23.230
TRAVIS: Lead the way.

00:15:23.230 --> 00:15:25.820
LAURA: Percy, look over there with your eyesight,
look through

00:15:25.820 --> 00:15:28.240
your little scope and see what you see.

00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:29.990
TALIESIN: I'm gonna try and scope it.

00:15:29.990 --> 00:15:33.160
MATT: Okay. Make a perception check with
advantage.

00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:39.380
TALIESIN: Ugh. Could be worse. 16.

00:15:39.380 --> 00:15:40.310
LAURA: Oh.

00:15:40.310 --> 00:15:46.340
MATT: Okay. You, um. You take a moment and kind of
train on this movement. You now see there are two

00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:51.980
figures that are facing each other, and they
themselves are covered in this horrible liquid,

00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:58.490
and you recognize the form a little bit.
These, they're humanoid, but they have long,

00:15:58.490 --> 00:16:07.450
exaggerated jaws, very long forearm limbs, tall,
straggly black hair, long, pointed hooked nose,

00:16:07.450 --> 00:16:14.040
and they're both eating something that's
partially stuck in this bog. These are trolls,

00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:19.560
these are two large trolls that are currently in
the process of eating some sort of creature.

00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:21.490
TALIESIN: A pair of trolls.

00:16:21.490 --> 00:16:23.560
LAURA: (whispering) We need to be very quiet.

00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:25.980
MATT: You've had a piece of troll in your bag for
a while.

00:16:25.980 --> 00:16:26.840
LAURA: Oh!

00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:29.150
TRAVIS: Oh yeah. Troll dick.

00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:30.950
LAURA: So we've killed them before, that's good to
know.

00:16:30.950 --> 00:16:32.660
TRAVIS: Yeah. They're huge.

00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:34.120
MATT: Trolls are pretty big.

00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:35.300
LAURA: They were--

00:16:35.300 --> 00:16:36.800
TRAIVS: About how big are they?

00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:39.530
MATT: Like... I'd say, even with the hunch,
nine feet tall.

00:16:39.530 --> 00:16:45.530
LAURA: Yeah. Just... you know, maybe go around?

00:16:45.530 --> 00:16:47.180
SAM: Yes, we should go around.

00:16:47.180 --> 00:16:48.600
LAURA: What do you think?

00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:50.150
SAM: We could kill them quite easily.

00:16:50.150 --> 00:16:50.950
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:16:50.950 --> 00:16:52.520
LAURA: Well, there's two of them that we see.

00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:54.220
TALIESIN: That we see.

00:16:54.220 --> 00:16:55.390
TRAVIS: Hey, Percy.

00:16:55.390 --> 00:16:58.190
LIAM: They're stupid, aren't they?

00:16:58.190 --> 00:16:59.390
LAURA: Didn't, wait--

00:16:59.390 --> 00:17:00.340
MARISHA: I don't know.

00:17:00.340 --> 00:17:02.660
LAURA: Didn't Tiberius turn into a lady-troll?

00:17:02.660 --> 00:17:04.090
TALIESIN: That was a thing, yes.

00:17:04.090 --> 00:17:05.400
MARISHA: That happened.

00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:06.430
LAURA: Oh.

00:17:06.430 --> 00:17:08.670
MARISHA: To be fair, also, everything in the
Feywild--

00:17:08.670 --> 00:17:09.650
SAM: What?

00:17:09.650 --> 00:17:12.720
MARISHA: -- has been more sensitive, defensive,
and more intelligent.

00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:14.110
LAURA: They could be smarter.

00:17:14.110 --> 00:17:15.580
TALIESIN: They could be smart trolls.

00:17:15.580 --> 00:17:17.760
LAURA: They could be, like, hag trolls, which is
just terrifying.

00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:19.890
TALIESIN: They're eating something that's stuck.

00:17:19.890 --> 00:17:21.730
LAURA: Which could be us very soon.

00:17:21.730 --> 00:17:23.100
TALIESIN: Which could be us very soon.

00:17:23.100 --> 00:17:24.370
LAURA: We need to keep moving.

00:17:24.370 --> 00:17:25.540
TALIESIN: Let's keep moving.

00:17:25.540 --> 00:17:27.070
LAURA: The longer we stand still, the more stuck
we get.

00:17:27.070 --> 00:17:30.090
MATT: You hear this (grunt) in the distance,
and you now, looking through your scope,

00:17:30.090 --> 00:17:34.250
you see that one of them has looked up from its
eating, its mouth covered in all sorts of shiny,

00:17:34.250 --> 00:17:39.900
fresh liquid, and it kind of glances past.
Its eyes, the pupils are white against yellow

00:17:39.900 --> 00:17:46.380
eyes, so it has this very kind of flash across a
cat's face type gleam across the eyeballs.

00:17:46.380 --> 00:17:51.240
They kind of... (grunts)

00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:52.710
LIAM: Can we all see this?

00:17:52.710 --> 00:17:56.230
MATT: Yeah, you guys can see, since you've all
made note of these creatures in the distance.

00:17:56.230 --> 00:17:58.670
LIAM: Why don't we back it up slow for once?

00:17:58.670 --> 00:18:00.850
LAURA: Well, how about we don't move at all right
now?

00:18:00.850 --> 00:18:03.300
MARISHA: Everybody freeze.

00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:09.440
MATT: Turns around, (trollish grunt), says
something to the other one. They both grab a big

00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:13.520
chunk of whatever they're eating, jam it in their
mouth, and then dive down into the muck.

00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:15.350
SAM: Oh, shit.

00:18:15.350 --> 00:18:18.200
LAURA: Can we get up in the trees?

00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:19.950
MATT: If you'd like to try and climb them.

00:18:19.950 --> 00:18:21.310
LAURA: Can we try and climb the trees?

00:18:21.310 --> 00:18:22.590
TALIESIN: We're going to try and climb a tree.

00:18:22.590 --> 00:18:24.260
SAM: To what end? Then we're just gonna sit here
forever?

00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:25.120
TALIESIN: For a minute.

00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:28.360
LAURA: Well no, we can go from tree branch to tree
branch. Are they tightly enough connected that we

00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:29.920
can travel on the top of the trees?

00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:31.650
MATT: Possibly. Might require some jumping.

00:18:31.650 --> 00:18:33.070
SAM: I am a backpack right now.

00:18:33.070 --> 00:18:34.910
LAURA: I'm gonna get on the broom and fly up.

00:18:34.910 --> 00:18:38.100
MATT: You fly up.

00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:39.860
LIAM: I'll climb after her.

00:18:39.860 --> 00:18:42.110
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and make an athletics check,
if you don't mind, Vax.

00:18:42.110 --> 00:18:44.800
TRAVIS: I'm not scared of trolls.

00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:45.390
LIAM: 18.

00:18:45.390 --> 00:18:46.810
SAM: Could you be, please?

00:18:46.810 --> 00:18:50.920
MATT: It takes you a minute, but you manage to get
up to the tree. You come up into the trees.

00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:53.300
Do you break the canopy, or do you stop up at the
branches?

00:18:53.300 --> 00:18:58.810
LAURA: I wanted to... yeah, sure, I'll break the
canopy.

00:18:58.810 --> 00:19:02.760
MATT: Okay. As you're climbing up, your sister
actually goes past where the branches, leaves,

00:19:02.780 --> 00:19:07.310
and the top of the trees end. Before you can
really kind of speak out to question, she

00:19:07.310 --> 00:19:14.360
disappears. You, Vex, come shooting up off the top
out, and you can see now before you the Shademirk

00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:19.280
in its entirety, kind of wrapping around the base
of this one mountain, that kind of comes up into

00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:27.020
two sharp peaks, like horns on some sort of a
large debased devil, but it's just a formless rock

00:19:27.020 --> 00:19:31.910
mold that comes up into those two peaks.
Looking around you, you can see the trees are

00:19:31.910 --> 00:19:37.460
very, very dense and heavily packed together,
and what immediately catches your eye is about

00:19:37.460 --> 00:19:44.660
two, three miles ahead, right towards where the
base of the mountain seems to sink into the

00:19:44.660 --> 00:19:50.100
Shademirk, there is one very, very large tree that
stands above the rest of them.

00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:52.140
LAURA: Oh, shit. Why didn't I go above the canopy
before?

00:19:52.140 --> 00:19:54.240
MARISHA: Is it to the northwest?

00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:58.650
MATT: It is what would be considered to the
northwest of you. It, whereas the rest of the

00:19:58.650 --> 00:20:05.410
Shademirk continues to this relative 20-,
30-foot-tall canopy, this tree probably goes

00:20:05.410 --> 00:20:11.380
up about a hundred-plus feet and the branches
string outward and have long strands and vines

00:20:11.380 --> 00:20:19.600
dangling from them, it's, this is a massive
example of local flora and fauna.

00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:25.710
LAURA: Wow. Okay. I say, I see the tree! And I
come back down into the canopy.

00:20:25.710 --> 00:20:26.910
MATT: Okay.

00:20:26.910 --> 00:20:33.610
LAURA: Can I come down and grab... Keyleth? And
lift her up into the tree too?

00:20:33.610 --> 00:20:34.760
MATT: Sure.

00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:37.400
MARISHA: Ooh.

00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:40.920
TRAVIS: How high are the lowest branches?

00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:44.690
MATT: The lowest branches are about seven feet
up.

00:20:44.690 --> 00:20:46.650
TRAVIS: You wanna lift?

00:20:46.650 --> 00:20:52.800
SAM: I'm just a passenger. I'm on you. If you're
not going up, I'm staying on you.

00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:54.030
TRAVIS: I'm not going up.

00:20:54.030 --> 00:20:55.080
LAURA: You're not gonna go up in the tree?

00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:55.960
SAM: We're gonna--

00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:59.590
TRAVIS: You think my giant ass is gonna jump
frockily-fucky-fucky from branch to branch in the

00:20:59.590 --> 00:21:02.350
treetops like some kind of acrobat?

00:21:02.350 --> 00:21:03.380
LAURA: I don't know.

00:21:03.380 --> 00:21:05.700
TRAVIS: No! No.

00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:10.620
SAM: We're standing our muck.

00:21:10.620 --> 00:21:15.390
MARISHA: Well, okay, is what we're trying to do
figure out a way to not have to walk in the muck?

00:21:15.390 --> 00:21:16.480
LAURA: Yeah, I think so.

00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:17.580
MARISHA: You're--

00:21:17.580 --> 00:21:20.450
LAURA: I feel like the trolls are gonna pop up,
like, somewhere near us.

00:21:20.450 --> 00:21:22.270
TRAVIS: Can I put my back against a tree?

00:21:22.270 --> 00:21:22.970
MATT: Yeah.

00:21:22.970 --> 00:21:23.900
TRAVIS: A large tree.

00:21:23.900 --> 00:21:26.950
MATT: Yeah. The nearest tree, the one that Vax
actually climbed up, is the one that's closest to

00:21:26.950 --> 00:21:32.240
you guys, and it's close enough for you to just
take a five-foot step back up into it.

00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:36.120
SAM: I'm back here! I'm back here, I'm back here,
I'm back here!

00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:37.450
LAURA: You're against the tree.

00:21:37.450 --> 00:21:40.690
TRAVIS: I turn around. The trees talk.

00:21:40.690 --> 00:21:42.770
SAM: It's me. Don't back up into a tree--

00:21:42.770 --> 00:21:44.540
TRAVIS: I spin around again and put my back to
this tree.

00:21:44.540 --> 00:21:47.320
SAM: I'm still back here! I'm still back here!

00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:48.360
TRAVIS: Oh.

00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:50.620
LAURA: While that's going on, can I fly down and
get Percy out of the muck

00:21:50.620 --> 00:21:52.110
and bring him up into the tree?

00:21:52.110 --> 00:21:53.550
MATT: Sure.

00:21:53.550 --> 00:21:57.170
LIAM: I'm gonna chime in over the earring and say,
Somebody could turn Grog into a marmoset or

00:21:57.170 --> 00:21:58.950
something, that would work for the circumstances.

00:21:58.950 --> 00:22:00.270
LAURA: Oh, shit.

00:22:00.270 --> 00:22:03.820
MARISHA: That's what I was gonna say, I can always
polymorph you for a moment, Grog.

00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:09.030
TRAVIS: I might be down with being some kind of
monkey.

00:22:09.030 --> 00:22:13.970
MARISHA: You want to be a monkey? Yeah. What kind
of monkey?

00:22:13.970 --> 00:22:14.830
TRAVIS: Gorilla.

00:22:14.830 --> 00:22:15.640
MARISHA: Okay.

00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:16.700
LAURA: Oh, shit.

00:22:16.700 --> 00:22:18.500
MARISHA: And I turn Grog into a gorilla.

00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:22.420
MATT: And with that, Grog's already pretty large
form just grows smaller and hairier.

00:22:22.420 --> 00:22:26.630
TRAVIS: Nimble as shit.

00:22:26.630 --> 00:22:29.950
LAURA: What the fuck! I should get Scanlan...

00:22:29.950 --> 00:22:34.200
MATT: You look down at yourself and kind of
marveling at your hands, which haven't changed too

00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:37.970
much other than the place some of the fingers and
thumbs, you already have pretty big, strong,

00:22:37.970 --> 00:22:42.330
hands, but you also pull up one of your feet from
the muck and you can see the additional appendage

00:22:42.330 --> 00:22:48.310
that you now have in the prehensile toes.

00:22:48.310 --> 00:22:50.670
LAURA: Grog, get in the tree, get in the tree.

00:22:50.670 --> 00:22:51.980
TALIESIN: I don't see a change, I'm not sure.

00:22:51.980 --> 00:22:52.590
TRAVIS: No.

00:22:52.590 --> 00:22:53.230
LAURA: Tree.

00:22:53.230 --> 00:22:53.850
TRAVIS: No.

00:22:53.850 --> 00:22:54.930
LAURA: Please.

00:22:54.930 --> 00:22:55.580
TRAVIS: Grog.

00:22:55.580 --> 00:22:56.690
LAURA: Aw.

00:22:56.690 --> 00:22:58.600
SAM: Also has the mind of an ape.

00:22:58.600 --> 00:22:59.540
MATT: Yep.

00:22:59.540 --> 00:23:00.500
LAURA: Seriously?

00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:01.390
MATT: Yeah.

00:23:01.390 --> 00:23:03.310
MARISHA: Which might be more intelligent than what
he was before...

00:23:03.310 --> 00:23:04.390
MATT: Actually, let's...

00:23:04.390 --> 00:23:05.500
TRAVIS: Ah, shit.

00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:08.000
MATT: Let's have a look what the--

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:11.680
TRAVIS: Gorillas can't--

00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:16.190
MATT: Let's see, let's pull up the Monster Manual
here and see exactly what we're working with.

00:23:16.190 --> 00:23:17.620
LAURA: Gorillas are pretty fucking smart.

00:23:17.620 --> 00:23:18.620
TALIESIN: Yeah, you have one, don't you?

00:23:18.620 --> 00:23:19.960
MARISHA: I think I do.

00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:21.890
LAURA: I think they'd be smarter than Grog.

00:23:21.890 --> 00:23:23.750
MARISHA: I do, but I don't have it in my little
book.

00:23:23.750 --> 00:23:25.870
LAURA: They can learn sign language, they have,
like, an entire, yeah.

00:23:25.870 --> 00:23:30.410
LIAM: Strongjaw's kitten?

00:23:30.410 --> 00:23:32.650
LAURA: Oh!

00:23:32.650 --> 00:23:37.470
MATT: All right, we'll go with the stats for an
ape, 'cause that's what's here and available.

00:23:37.470 --> 00:23:40.590
They do have intelligence of six, so you are as
intelligent as you were before.

00:23:40.590 --> 00:23:42.470
(All laugh.)

00:23:42.470 --> 00:23:43.970
TRAVIS: But I do this with my foot.

00:23:43.970 --> 00:23:47.380
(All laugh.)

00:23:47.380 --> 00:23:49.410
MARISHA: Looks good on you, Grog.

00:23:49.410 --> 00:23:51.130
TRAVIS: I'm gonna-- can I?

00:23:51.130 --> 00:23:52.130
MATT: No, you can't talk.

00:23:52.130 --> 00:23:54.960
TRAVIS: (gorilla noises)

00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:58.890
LAURA: Shit. Scanlan, do you want to ride on
Grog's back still,

00:23:58.890 --> 00:24:00.360
or do you want to come up in the tree?

00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:01.370
SAM: No, I don't--

00:24:01.370 --> 00:24:02.590
TRAVIS: (gorilla noises)

00:24:02.590 --> 00:24:06.070
MARISHA: Ooh, you'd be like a little silverback
baby.

00:24:06.070 --> 00:24:08.250
LAURA: Can I go down and grab Scanlan and put him
on the broom with me?

00:24:08.250 --> 00:24:08.930
MATT: Sure.

00:24:08.930 --> 00:24:09.630
LAURA: Okay.

00:24:09.630 --> 00:24:10.780
SAM: Thank you.

00:24:10.780 --> 00:24:12.530
LIAM: Honestly, I can't even tell the difference.

00:24:12.530 --> 00:24:14.320
TRAVIS: That still translates, right?

00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:15.560
MATT: Yeah.

00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:18.300
MARISHA: Okay, I know the twins are good on
flying, for the most part.

00:24:18.300 --> 00:24:19.810
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'll stay down here as bait.

00:24:19.810 --> 00:24:21.350
LAURA: Yeah, yeah.

00:24:21.350 --> 00:24:25.790
LIAM: I don't know, how long ago did you bust out
my wings for me, DM? Under 24 hours?

00:24:25.790 --> 00:24:28.460
MATT: Yeah, it's been under 24 hours. So
unfortunately your wings are not available.

00:24:28.460 --> 00:24:29.890
LAURA: No wings for you.

00:24:29.890 --> 00:24:33.550
MARISHA: Well, but you can walk unhindered,
right? You can walk fine?

00:24:33.550 --> 00:24:34.790
LAURA: Yeah, yeah.

00:24:34.790 --> 00:24:36.630
MARISHA: Can someone borrow your broom?

00:24:36.630 --> 00:24:37.800
LAURA: Again? Yes.

00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:38.900
MARISHA: Again. (laughs)

00:24:38.900 --> 00:24:41.170
LAURA: Yeah, that worked really well last time.
Totally. Somebody can.

00:24:41.170 --> 00:24:44.390
MARISHA: Give it to your brother. He's
trustworthy, right? Right? Right, Vax?

00:24:44.390 --> 00:24:51.730
LAURA: He had the carpet before, so. Maybe not so
much, but the whole point was for the trolls to

00:24:51.730 --> 00:24:55.480
not have us on the ground, the trolls, but.

00:24:55.480 --> 00:24:57.080
MARISHA: Oh, right, that's true.

00:24:57.080 --> 00:24:58.950
LAURA: Can we just try to travel amongst the
trees?

00:24:58.950 --> 00:25:00.730
TALIESIN: Let's see what happens.

00:25:00.730 --> 00:25:03.790
SAM: Stick to the plan.

00:25:03.790 --> 00:25:08.230
MARISHA: I'm gonna go ahead, I'm gonna use a
Beastshape and I'm gonna go into an eagle form.

00:25:08.230 --> 00:25:14.190
MATT: Okay. Giant eagle. All right. Beastshape is
taken, he's gorillafied,

00:25:14.190 --> 00:25:16.060
you have Scanlan up on your broom.

00:25:16.060 --> 00:25:17.280
LAURA: Yes.

00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:20.370
MATT: And then Vax and... Percy, are you just
traveling through the canopy?

00:25:20.370 --> 00:25:21.540
LAURA: Shit.

00:25:21.540 --> 00:25:23.160
MATT: Or are you carrying somebody, Keyleth?

00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:24.130
LAURA: Do you wanna carry Scanlan?

00:25:24.130 --> 00:25:25.360
MARISHA: I can carry Scanlan.

00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:26.430
MATT: Okay.

00:25:26.430 --> 00:25:27.890
LIAM: How thick are the trees here?

00:25:27.890 --> 00:25:29.250
LAURA: I feel like we could--

00:25:29.250 --> 00:25:31.710
MATT: They range anywhere from between five feet
and--

00:25:31.710 --> 00:25:35.720
LIAM: I had such a hard time when I flew up the
other day, such a hard time...

00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:37.200
LAURA: Yeah.

00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:40.420
LIAM: And everyone's just floating up, easy as
pie.

00:25:40.420 --> 00:25:43.030
MARISHA: To be fair, I've been flying a lot longer
than you have, Vax.

00:25:43.030 --> 00:25:44.860
LAURA: That's true, and your wings are much larger
than hers were.

00:25:44.860 --> 00:25:45.640
MARISHA: It's true.

00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:46.880
LIAM: Yeah.

00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:49.970
LAURA: Yeah. And I've got a skinny little broom,
so I'm not flapping any wings.

00:25:49.970 --> 00:25:51.740
LIAM: I'm skinnier than your broom.

00:25:51.740 --> 00:25:52.970
LAURA: Yes, well.

00:25:52.970 --> 00:25:55.380
(Marisha laughs.)

00:25:55.380 --> 00:25:56.940
LIAM: Let's do it.

00:25:56.940 --> 00:25:57.590
TALIESIN: All right.

00:25:57.590 --> 00:25:58.560
MATT: All right.

00:25:58.560 --> 00:26:01.720
LAURA: Then I guess I can take one of you on the
broom with me.

00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:04.330
TALIESIN: Take him. I'll be fine. I'm gonna,
I have a potion of climbing.

00:26:04.330 --> 00:26:06.370
LAURA: Do you wanna hop on this, since you have no
flight?

00:26:06.370 --> 00:26:07.760
MARISHA: Ooh, potion of climbing, nice.

00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:08.780
LAURA: Brother?

00:26:08.780 --> 00:26:11.810
MARISHA: All right, I fly over to Scanlan.

00:26:11.810 --> 00:26:13.480
LIAM: No, but I will anyway.

00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:14.850
SAM: I'm with you now?

00:26:14.850 --> 00:26:15.970
MARISHA: (eagle sound)

00:26:15.970 --> 00:26:17.110
LAURA: All right, he's on the broom with me.

00:26:17.110 --> 00:26:20.340
MATT: All right, so the twins are on the broom,
they go up. Grog, you just have a field day

00:26:20.340 --> 00:26:25.930
leaping through those branches, and just coasting
through, keeping an eye best you can on the

00:26:25.930 --> 00:26:29.160
guiding broom above the actual tree canopy.
You go ahead and

00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:31.340
grab Scanlan as well and follow suit.

00:26:31.340 --> 00:26:35.370
MATT: As soon as you break up as well, you can see
the large tree in the distance. Percy, doing the

00:26:35.370 --> 00:26:39.070
best you can to keep an eye on Grog or at least
listen to that regard, you drink your potion of

00:26:39.070 --> 00:26:43.750
climbing and begin leaping off and kind of
ninja-scattering your way through the higher

00:26:43.750 --> 00:26:45.320
branches of the trees as well.

00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:46.570
TRAVIS: Anime shit.

00:26:46.570 --> 00:26:47.430
TALIESIN: Oh yeah.

00:26:47.430 --> 00:26:53.330
MATT: So if I can go ahead and get Grog and Percy
to go ahead and make three successive athletics

00:26:53.330 --> 00:26:54.800
checks, if you could.

00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:56.480
TALIESIN: With advantage?

00:26:56.480 --> 00:26:58.690
MATT: This would be, for you it would be
advantage, yeah.

00:26:58.690 --> 00:27:02.270
TRAVIS: What's the modifier for king of the apes?

00:27:02.270 --> 00:27:04.700
MATT: You know what, I'll give you advantage on
this just 'cause you're an ape.

00:27:04.700 --> 00:27:07.140
TALIESIN: Athletics or acrobatics?

00:27:07.140 --> 00:27:09.820
MATT: Um. For the purposes of climbing and
grabbing,

00:27:09.820 --> 00:27:11.360
I would say this is more of an athletics check.

00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:12.280
TALIESIN: Okay.

00:27:12.280 --> 00:27:14.830
MATT: Since this is more upper-body strength
and--

00:27:14.830 --> 00:27:18.270
LAURA: Not parkouring, not parkouring through the
treetops.

00:27:18.270 --> 00:27:19.100
TALIESIN: That'll do.

00:27:19.100 --> 00:27:20.600
TRAVIS: That's a 20, 12 plus eight.

00:27:20.600 --> 00:27:21.800
TALIESIN: 16.

00:27:21.800 --> 00:27:25.590
MATT: All righty.

00:27:25.590 --> 00:27:26.660
TRAVIS: 21.

00:27:26.660 --> 00:27:27.730
TALIESIN: 24.

00:27:27.730 --> 00:27:29.690
MATT: All righty. Last one.

00:27:29.690 --> 00:27:31.670
TRAVIS: Not so great. 23.

00:27:31.670 --> 00:27:33.410
TALIESIN: Natural 20.

00:27:33.410 --> 00:27:39.690
MATT: All righty. To your surprise, as the potion
energy surges through your body, even with the

00:27:39.690 --> 00:27:43.820
relatively slick surface that a lot of these
branches and trees have, you have an innate

00:27:43.820 --> 00:27:47.730
ability to point out which ones are the strongest,
easiest to grab a hold and just keep the momentum

00:27:47.730 --> 00:27:51.750
going in the semblance of a parkour-like
leap-and-grab-type circumstance, you have managed

00:27:51.750 --> 00:27:56.810
to move through almost with the grace of the
gorilla ahead of you. You lose sight a few times,

00:27:56.810 --> 00:28:01.580
but you guys do take the better part of the next
forty minutes or so to eventually make your way

00:28:01.580 --> 00:28:07.500
closer and closer to the tree where the shadow,
the shade of it against the permanently dusk sun

00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:12.470
now begins to creep over the place you are in the
forest. You have now entered a shaded nightfall by

00:28:12.470 --> 00:28:18.750
the actual tree's location and placement.
The lower forest below you is pitch-black at this

00:28:18.750 --> 00:28:23.510
point, other than a little bit of light that
filters in from nearby lit areas of the forest.

00:28:23.510 --> 00:28:24.990
(Audible feedback.)

00:28:24.990 --> 00:28:25.700
LAURA: Oh.

00:28:25.700 --> 00:28:26.370
MATT: Oh?

00:28:26.370 --> 00:28:26.990
LAURA: Oh.

00:28:26.990 --> 00:28:28.270
SAM: There's a punk band warming up.

00:28:28.270 --> 00:28:30.010
(All laugh.)

00:28:30.010 --> 00:28:40.610
MATT: Never ends. There we go. You guys make your
way towards, are you going straight for the tree

00:28:40.610 --> 00:28:41.730
or are you...?

00:28:41.730 --> 00:28:43.840
LAURA: Okay. Do we wanna go straight for the tree
now,

00:28:43.840 --> 00:28:45.630
or do we wanna like rest up before we do
that?

00:28:45.630 --> 00:28:47.570
TALIESIN: I think we want to observe it and rest
up.

00:28:47.570 --> 00:28:48.440
LIAM: Observe, yes.

00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:49.230
MARISHA: Like scout?

00:28:49.230 --> 00:28:50.350
LAURA: Watch it and see what's going on with it?

00:28:50.350 --> 00:28:51.090
LIAM: Yes.

00:28:51.090 --> 00:28:52.490
LAURA: Before we just go straight to it?

00:28:52.490 --> 00:28:53.490
TRAVIS: We don't have the mansion, right?

00:28:53.490 --> 00:28:54.420
SAM: We have the mansion.

00:28:54.420 --> 00:28:55.890
TALIESIN: We do. We have the mansion.

00:28:55.890 --> 00:28:58.230
TRAVIS: (gorilla noise)

00:28:58.230 --> 00:29:01.230
SAM: How many hours since we've slept last?

00:29:01.230 --> 00:29:06.130
MATT: I'd say it's probably been, surmising,
six to seven.

00:29:06.130 --> 00:29:10.350
TALIESIN: Really? It's been since the river.

00:29:10.350 --> 00:29:11.620
MATT: Yeah.

00:29:11.620 --> 00:29:12.460
LAURA: Yeah.

00:29:12.460 --> 00:29:15.240
SAM: So we can at least do some, we can get closer
and do some recon.

00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:16.320
LAURA: Yeah.

00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:18.560
LIAM: Let's do recon, let's observe it for the
next six to ten hours

00:29:18.560 --> 00:29:20.110
and then rest up in the shag.

00:29:20.110 --> 00:29:21.530
LAURA: That's a long time. All right.

00:29:21.530 --> 00:29:25.320
MARISHA: I go ahead and I take off with Scanlan
and do kind of

00:29:25.320 --> 00:29:26.730
a high aerial loop around the tree.

00:29:26.730 --> 00:29:28.660
SAM: (worried noise)

00:29:28.660 --> 00:29:29.940
MATT: All righty.

00:29:29.940 --> 00:29:31.870
LAURA: Oh jeez, around the tree? Around it?

00:29:31.870 --> 00:29:34.130
MARISHA: Just at the top, really high. Really
high, getting nice--

00:29:34.130 --> 00:29:39.890
LAURA: I wanna kind of perch on top of a tree
nearby and just kind of see it from there.

00:29:39.890 --> 00:29:40.790
MARISHA: Watch.

00:29:40.790 --> 00:29:43.190
TALIESIN: I want to see if I can find the source
of the bog muck.

00:29:43.190 --> 00:29:48.860
MATT: Okay. You both make a perception check from
being up in the tree.

00:29:48.860 --> 00:29:51.350
SAM: Wait, tre-- oh.

00:29:51.350 --> 00:29:52.720
MARISHA: Do I have advantage because I'm an
eagle?

00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:54.610
MATT: Well, it would be--

00:29:54.610 --> 00:29:57.250
SAM: Above the tree, yeah. Yeah, yeah.

00:29:57.250 --> 00:29:59.620
MARISHA: Don't eagles have advantage?

00:29:59.620 --> 00:30:00.570
SAM: Eight.

00:30:00.570 --> 00:30:04.330
(All laugh.)

00:30:04.330 --> 00:30:06.830
MARISHA: I do have advantage.

00:30:06.830 --> 00:30:07.820
SAM: Just 'cause.

00:30:07.820 --> 00:30:08.570
MARISHA: Okay.

00:30:08.570 --> 00:30:09.480
MATT: Eagle eyes.

00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:14.070
MARISHA: Eagle eyes. 27.

00:30:14.070 --> 00:30:22.650
MATT: 27. As you coast around the outside of this
gargantuan tree, you can see there are a number of

00:30:22.650 --> 00:30:28.430
places where the branches meet and where elements
of the bark are slightly split, and there is just

00:30:28.430 --> 00:30:36.640
a slow, perpetual flow of this black tar-like
substance. You've seen it on smaller scales

00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:41.590
seeping from the trees in this actual forest,
it's like the entirety of the landscape is kind

00:30:41.590 --> 00:30:46.460
of creating this, but the bulk of it, whether it
be the source of the general corruption or at

00:30:46.460 --> 00:30:51.880
least is the largest central location of its
source? There are a number of places throughout

00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:55.440
this tree where it's just seeping out like sap.

00:30:55.440 --> 00:30:56.820
MARISHA: Like sap.

00:30:56.820 --> 00:30:58.370
LAURA: Like bleeding out oil.

00:30:58.370 --> 00:30:59.720
MATT: Out of the actual tree.

00:30:59.720 --> 00:31:01.790
MARISHA: Like even the top of the tree and stuff.

00:31:01.790 --> 00:31:03.330
LIAM: Like evil maple syrup.

00:31:03.330 --> 00:31:04.650
MARISHA: Evil maple syrup, yeah.

00:31:04.650 --> 00:31:06.920
LAURA: Mm, sounds tasty. Can--

00:31:06.920 --> 00:31:08.190
TRAVIS: Like ghostbusters.

00:31:08.190 --> 00:31:13.710
LAURA: -- we see any kind of movement, any kind of
things moving around the tree?

00:31:13.710 --> 00:31:18.240
MATT: You don't see anything moving around the
tree at the moment, other than just the gentle

00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:22.800
swaying as a little bit of wind hits the sides of
it, portions of its long hundreds and hundreds of

00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:29.490
hanging vines just kind of slowly get moved and
tangled by the windfall. If you want to make a

00:31:29.490 --> 00:31:35.350
perception check as well.

00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:38.130
LAURA: Okay. That would be 30.

00:31:38.130 --> 00:31:39.710
MATT: Okay.

00:31:39.710 --> 00:31:43.870
LIAM: I got a natural 20. Using Luck.

00:31:43.870 --> 00:31:48.910
MATT: Great. So the two twins up there on the
broom, as you kind of glance around the other

00:31:48.910 --> 00:32:00.140
side, you both can see the branches themselves
occasionally will shift and curl up, almost like

00:32:00.140 --> 00:32:05.750
an arm recoiling, and then relax slowly back out
again,

00:32:05.750 --> 00:32:09.640
like a stretching arm held still for too long.

00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:16.190
LAURA: Oh, shit. I think the tree is alive and not
in a normal plant sort of way.

00:32:16.190 --> 00:32:17.420
LIAM: Yeah.

00:32:17.420 --> 00:32:18.510
LAURA: Yeah.

00:32:18.510 --> 00:32:21.980
MATT: You also notice some of the vines that are
wrapped around and kind of curled around these

00:32:21.980 --> 00:32:27.390
branches as well occasionally recoil and pull in
and shift and move up, it's like there's a whole

00:32:27.390 --> 00:32:33.510
ecosystem based around numerous forms of plant
life that cause this thing

00:32:33.510 --> 00:32:35.910
to almost act like a giant organism.

00:32:35.910 --> 00:32:37.690
LAURA: Fuck, I do not wanna get close to that
thing.

00:32:37.690 --> 00:32:39.240
MARISHA: I know, that's intimidating.

00:32:39.240 --> 00:32:43.100
LIAM: I'm gonna rest my chin on my sister's
shoulder and just stare for a minute and say,

00:32:43.100 --> 00:32:47.800
you know, that bow is going to be reeeally cool.

00:32:47.800 --> 00:32:49.810
LAURA: God, I hope so.

00:32:49.810 --> 00:32:52.130
LIAM: Yeah. Worth it.

00:32:52.130 --> 00:32:54.310
MARISHA: Still on my back, Scanlan, you wanna get
closer?

00:32:54.310 --> 00:32:59.470
SAM: I'm using my eight perception, I report to
the others, it's just a normal tree, guys.

00:32:59.470 --> 00:33:01.550
(All laugh.)

00:33:01.550 --> 00:33:04.920
SAM: Nothing out of the ordinary, no movement,
nothing. It's safe.

00:33:04.920 --> 00:33:09.670
LAURA: Thanks, Scanlan. Your eyes, your eyes...

00:33:09.670 --> 00:33:12.100
TRAVIS: Can I check myself for parasites?

00:33:12.100 --> 00:33:14.500
MATT: You find a number of them, actually.
They're delicious.

00:33:14.500 --> 00:33:17.790
(All laugh.)

00:33:17.790 --> 00:33:21.610
MATT: For the two of you that are below the
treeline, you don't get a grand view above,

00:33:21.610 --> 00:33:25.570
it's too hard to see, but you guys make your way
close to the actual base of the tree?

00:33:25.570 --> 00:33:27.320
LAURA: Ugh! No! What? The base of the fucking
tree?

00:33:27.320 --> 00:33:28.410
LIAM: No, no.

00:33:28.410 --> 00:33:30.070
LAURA: No fucking way, don't do that.

00:33:30.070 --> 00:33:32.120
TALIESIN: I'm gonna get close enough to at least
make out some detail.

00:33:32.120 --> 00:33:34.300
MARISHA: And I'll do kind of a tighter loop around
it.

00:33:34.300 --> 00:33:34.910
MATT: Okay.

00:33:34.910 --> 00:33:36.740
MARISHA: See if I can get any more details.

00:33:36.740 --> 00:33:39.980
MATT: All right. Percy, you have to get pretty
close to even get a view because of the density of

00:33:39.980 --> 00:33:43.990
the trees the closer you get to this. So you guys
are probably going to have to get within 20,

00:33:43.990 --> 00:33:47.670
30 feet to get a view of the exterior of the
large tree.

00:33:47.670 --> 00:33:49.030
LIAM: That's a bad idea.

00:33:49.030 --> 00:33:50.880
LAURA: Yeah. Can we see him walking towards it?

00:33:50.880 --> 00:33:52.830
MATT: No, you have no view of them this high in
the canopy.

00:33:52.830 --> 00:33:53.620
LAURA: Fuck.

00:33:53.620 --> 00:33:57.060
MATT: They're below the treeline. Percy,
as you get closer you begin to notice that the

00:33:57.060 --> 00:34:03.390
actual roots of the tree almost come 10 feet up
before they merge with

00:34:03.390 --> 00:34:07.460
the outside of the tree itself, a number of--

00:34:07.460 --> 00:34:12.510
TALIESIN: Is it a solid trunk, or is it like a
combined trunk?

00:34:12.510 --> 00:34:19.010
MATT: It's a solid trunk in most of its places,
but there are swaths of vines that wrap around it

00:34:19.010 --> 00:34:25.050
and curl and create these giant, tight nets,
almost like a Rat King of tails across certain

00:34:25.050 --> 00:34:27.930
portions of its exterior near the base, and where
some of

00:34:27.930 --> 00:34:30.590
the roots join with the central tree trunk.

00:34:30.590 --> 00:34:34.270
TALIESIN: I'm gonna back up and try and find a
place to scan the ground,

00:34:34.270 --> 00:34:37.250
find a place to put a door for our mansion.

00:34:37.250 --> 00:34:38.260
MATT: Okay.

00:34:38.260 --> 00:34:39.270
TALIESIN: Safe.

00:34:39.270 --> 00:34:43.420
MATT: Okay, I mean, there are a number of areas
that are somewhat clear on the ground, but there

00:34:43.420 --> 00:34:49.790
is no-- All the landscape is coated with this
molasses-type material, even the bits that aren't

00:34:49.790 --> 00:34:54.600
submerged and are relatively shallow, there is
still that substance all across them.

00:34:54.600 --> 00:34:59.160
MARISHA: I was doing a tighter loop.

00:34:59.160 --> 00:35:00.530
MATT: Right.

00:35:00.530 --> 00:35:03.650
MARISHA: Of the tree, see if I can get any more
details that we haven't already seen.

00:35:03.650 --> 00:35:08.390
MATT: Okay. Keeping your eyes out as best you can
as you loop around a second time, you get closer,

00:35:08.390 --> 00:35:13.700
no real change in what you're able to observe.
You have a higher detailed look at it, but once

00:35:13.700 --> 00:35:19.160
again, you see a number of these vine-clusters
around the base of some of these branches,

00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:22.500
you see elements where the bark has split and
sealed over and split again

00:35:22.500 --> 00:35:25.030
and just spills out more of this black filth.

00:35:25.030 --> 00:35:27.840
MARISHA: Okay.

00:35:27.840 --> 00:35:33.000
MATT: You aren't able to make out any sort of
other details about its surface.

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:34.490
MARISHA: I fly back to the others.

00:35:34.490 --> 00:35:35.010
MATT: Okay.

00:35:35.010 --> 00:35:35.850
LAURA: Percy?

00:35:35.850 --> 00:35:36.660
TALIESIN: Yes?

00:35:36.660 --> 00:35:38.170
LAURA: Are you on the ground?

00:35:38.170 --> 00:35:39.590
TALIESIN: No, but I'm close to it.

00:35:39.590 --> 00:35:42.540
LAURA: Do you see any sort of animal life around
the tree?

00:35:42.540 --> 00:35:46.290
TALIESIN: Nothing, no.

00:35:46.290 --> 00:35:54.320
LAURA: The only thing I've seen is actual branches
moving like arms. I think the tree's alive.

00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:58.020
TALIESIN: If I were animal life, I would live
beneath the surface.

00:35:58.020 --> 00:36:00.520
LAURA: Like the trolls.

00:36:00.520 --> 00:36:08.250
TALIESIN: Like the trolls. I think there's quite
possibly things that live in the muck.

00:36:08.250 --> 00:36:10.760
Probably not on top of it.

00:36:10.760 --> 00:36:17.190
LAURA: Do you guys think maybe we should, um.
We should get in the mansion and have a nice

00:36:17.190 --> 00:36:20.180
little chat and figure out what the fuck we're
gonna do?

00:36:20.180 --> 00:36:22.690
SAM: Sure. Sounds good to me.

00:36:22.690 --> 00:36:24.410
TRAVIS: How do I not become a gorilla anymore?

00:36:24.410 --> 00:36:25.400
LAURA: Yeah?

00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:26.850
LIAM: Yeah. We want to be at full strength.

00:36:26.850 --> 00:36:28.260
MATT: You don't.

00:36:28.260 --> 00:36:29.640
MARISHA: It's up to me.

00:36:29.640 --> 00:36:30.820
LIAM: Don't run in willy-nilly.

00:36:30.820 --> 00:36:32.520
TRAVIS: I look at Keyleth and I go--

00:36:32.520 --> 00:36:34.610
MATT: She doesn't see you, 'cause she's way above
the trees and you're just kind of down in the

00:36:34.610 --> 00:36:37.460
forest as a gorilla going--

00:36:37.460 --> 00:36:39.330
TRAVIS: I'm on the ground?

00:36:39.330 --> 00:36:43.250
MATT: You're not on the ground, you're up in the
actual tree top.

00:36:43.250 --> 00:36:49.990
SAM: While we still have a, I'll phone down to Vex
and Vax and Percy and say, while we still have a

00:36:49.990 --> 00:36:56.280
giant eagle, is there any point to us, to me and
Kiki scanning back to where those trolls were and

00:36:56.280 --> 00:37:00.010
just making sure they're not following us or
anything?

00:37:00.010 --> 00:37:02.750
TALIESIN: No, although if you find a log
approximately two feet thick,

00:37:02.750 --> 00:37:04.670
I could certainly use that.

00:37:04.670 --> 00:37:05.640
SAM: A log?

00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:07.300
TALIESIN: A log, about two feet thick.

00:37:07.300 --> 00:37:08.560
LAURA: About how long, though?

00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:12.540
TALIESIN: Doesn't matter.

00:37:12.540 --> 00:37:17.250
LAURA: You wanna fly down? We fly down, I take the
broom and try to find a log.

00:37:17.250 --> 00:37:18.560
LIAM: Yeah, you're in control.

00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:19.400
LAURA: All right.

00:37:19.400 --> 00:37:24.260
MATT: All right, so the two of you kind of-- make
a perception check.

00:37:24.260 --> 00:37:27.020
LAURA: (laughs) Yeah.

00:37:27.020 --> 00:37:28.130
LIAM: Seventeen.

00:37:28.130 --> 00:37:30.020
LAURA: That's interesting. I got fifteen.

00:37:30.020 --> 00:37:31.810
MATT: Okay, uh.

00:37:31.810 --> 00:37:34.250
LIAM: What a lackluster okay.

00:37:34.250 --> 00:37:35.850
LAURA: Yeah, okay.

00:37:35.850 --> 00:37:43.090
MATT: It takes you guys the better part of an hour
to finally find a piece of abandoned dead tree

00:37:43.090 --> 00:37:45.530
husk from which you'll be able to carve a piece
that

00:37:45.530 --> 00:37:47.770
matches the description of what
Percy's requesting.

00:37:47.770 --> 00:37:48.980
LAURA: All right.

00:37:48.980 --> 00:37:52.930
MATT: Requires some cleaning, it is very thick
with the actual tar, but you do manage to bring it

00:37:52.930 --> 00:37:56.930
back to him. A little larger than what you wanted,
but it can be carved down.

00:37:56.930 --> 00:38:00.440
TALIESIN: It's fine, I've got a thought,
so I'm gonna try something.

00:38:00.440 --> 00:38:03.340
MARISHA: I drop Grog's polymorph and my eagle
form.

00:38:03.340 --> 00:38:04.680
SAM: (screams as though falling)

00:38:04.680 --> 00:38:08.600
MARISHA: ...after I've landed.

00:38:08.600 --> 00:38:10.060
SAM: Oh, okay.

00:38:10.060 --> 00:38:12.430
MATT: Okay. You are back to your regular Grog
self.

00:38:12.430 --> 00:38:19.930
TRAVIS: My pants are down, as my hand was behind
my bottom, just contemplating flinging some poo.

00:38:19.930 --> 00:38:23.760
MATT: All right, and in that brief moment all of a
sudden you are, well, some of your sense have come

00:38:23.760 --> 00:38:26.940
to you. Not much else has changed other than your
physicality, but...

00:38:26.940 --> 00:38:27.990
TRAVIS: Hi guys.

00:38:27.990 --> 00:38:29.160
LAURA: Hi Grog.

00:38:29.160 --> 00:38:32.080
LIAM: I think a little bit actually got out,
buddy.

00:38:32.080 --> 00:38:36.430
LAURA: Gross! Come on.

00:38:36.430 --> 00:38:41.080
TRAVIS: It didn't, don't worry.

00:38:41.080 --> 00:38:43.370
LAURA: So foul.

00:38:43.370 --> 00:38:48.440
MATT: All right, so. You've all managed to
reconvene a little ways off from the base of this

00:38:48.440 --> 00:38:53.230
large tree. What do you wish to do?

00:38:53.230 --> 00:38:55.070
SAM: Should we--

00:38:55.070 --> 00:38:57.260
LAURA: (singing) Mansion it up!

00:38:57.260 --> 00:38:58.060
SAM: Yeah?

00:38:58.060 --> 00:39:01.480
TALIESIN: I could use some sleep, and I've got a
little thing to work on for the moment.

00:39:01.480 --> 00:39:02.210
SAM: Okay.

00:39:02.210 --> 00:39:04.900
LIAM: What are you doing with this log, Percival?
What is this for?

00:39:04.900 --> 00:39:06.190
MARISHA: Is this what we were talking about that
time?

00:39:06.190 --> 00:39:07.170
TALIESIN: Swamp shoes.

00:39:07.170 --> 00:39:07.930
MARISHA: Swamp shoes.

00:39:07.930 --> 00:39:09.000
LAURA: Swamp shoes?

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:10.270
TALIESIN: I think some swamp shoes might not be a
terrible idea.

00:39:10.270 --> 00:39:11.730
MARISHA: I can help you with those.

00:39:11.730 --> 00:39:13.480
TALIESIN: Thank you. Swamp shoes.

00:39:13.480 --> 00:39:14.650
LAURA: So you can walk like me?

00:39:14.650 --> 00:39:19.130
TALIESIN: Yes. I mean, not quickly, it won't help
you walk quickly, it's not necessarily the most

00:39:19.130 --> 00:39:22.910
stealthy thing on earth, but you won't drop two
feet into the muck every time you take a step.

00:39:22.910 --> 00:39:23.760
LAURA: That's good.

00:39:23.760 --> 00:39:27.860
TRAVIS: I've got a question. Can one of us that
can turn into things go in the muck?

00:39:27.860 --> 00:39:29.590
LAURA: Oh.

00:39:29.590 --> 00:39:32.420
TALIESIN: Maybe.

00:39:32.420 --> 00:39:39.750
LAURA: I feel like, is it bad? Do we get any kind
of bad vibe, bad energy off the muck?

00:39:39.750 --> 00:39:42.060
SAM: Other than it being black magic?

00:39:42.060 --> 00:39:45.960
MATT: Roll an insight check.

00:39:45.960 --> 00:39:47.870
TALIESIN: The muck is unhappy to be there.

00:39:47.870 --> 00:39:49.420
MARISHA: That mud looked at me the wrong way.

00:39:49.420 --> 00:39:51.710
LAURA: No, but I mean, what if it makes us sad to
be around it?

00:39:51.710 --> 00:39:53.160
TALIESIN: It does make us sad to be around it.

00:39:53.160 --> 00:39:56.960
LAURA: Nineteen. Nineteen.

00:39:56.960 --> 00:39:59.650
MATT: Those are some nice boots you're wearing,
you're probably gonna have to get a new pair when

00:39:59.650 --> 00:40:09.040
all this is over. It stinks, it's sticky,
the muck itself is probably not a very nice

00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:14.310
conversationalist. It doesn't also from what you
can tell appear to be sentient or give you any

00:40:14.310 --> 00:40:16.670
kind of bad vibe that you can pick up.

00:40:16.670 --> 00:40:18.070
LAURA: Okay.

00:40:18.070 --> 00:40:19.500
TALIESIN: It's just muck.

00:40:19.590 --> 00:40:20.630
MATT: From looking at it. It is muck.

00:40:20.700 --> 00:40:21.650
TRAVIS: I mean, I'll go in and--

00:40:21.650 --> 00:40:22.100
MARISHA: I can go.

00:40:22.100 --> 00:40:22.510
TRAVIS: Yeah?

00:40:22.510 --> 00:40:23.300
LAURA: Stanky-stank.

00:40:23.300 --> 00:40:24.020
MATT: Stanky-stank.

00:40:24.020 --> 00:40:24.570
MARISHA: Sounds fun.

00:40:24.570 --> 00:40:27.320
TRAVIS: What are you gonna turn into?

00:40:27.320 --> 00:40:32.110
MARISHA: Something that burrows. I guess I
technically could've taken a short rest, correct?

00:40:32.110 --> 00:40:33.480
MATT: Not yet, no.

00:40:33.480 --> 00:40:34.470
TALIESIN: We haven't yet.

00:40:34.470 --> 00:40:35.600
SAM: So we're doing this now?

00:40:35.600 --> 00:40:37.900
MARISHA: In the time we're just chilling? Okay,
well, I'll take a short rest.

00:40:37.900 --> 00:40:39.970
TALIESIN: Let's take a long rest, I mean.

00:40:39.970 --> 00:40:41.330
SAM: Well, no, I--

00:40:41.330 --> 00:40:42.850
MARISHA: I just want to take a short rest, just--

00:40:42.850 --> 00:40:46.260
MATT: A short rest is about half an hour or so.
Half an hour to an hour.

00:40:46.260 --> 00:40:48.210
MARISHA: Yeah, just enough time, and then I'm
gonna

00:40:48.210 --> 00:40:51.040
turn into an earth elemental and I'm gonna
swan dive--

00:40:51.040 --> 00:40:51.990
SAM: Wait, wait!

00:40:51.990 --> 00:40:53.060
LAURA: Swan dive?

00:40:53.060 --> 00:40:55.740
MATT: We'll get to that. Because as you take your
short rest and

00:40:55.740 --> 00:40:59.840
begin sitting amongst the ground or
the bough of the trees--

00:40:59.840 --> 00:41:02.670
MARISHA: I thought we were in the mansion.

00:41:02.670 --> 00:41:04.430
MATT: No, the mansion hasn't been cast yet.

00:41:04.430 --> 00:41:05.460
MARISHA: Oh.

00:41:05.460 --> 00:41:10.530
MATT: So as you're resting, here amongst the tree
tops--

00:41:10.530 --> 00:41:12.160
LAURA: We're in the tree tops.

00:41:12.160 --> 00:41:16.230
MATT: Yeah. The branches begin to sag ever so
slowly.

00:41:16.230 --> 00:41:17.290
LAURA: Shit.

00:41:17.290 --> 00:41:24.980
MATT: And particularly Keyleth and Percy,
actually Grog as well, you begin to feel the

00:41:24.980 --> 00:41:31.160
branches slowly almost trying to push you off
them, like you sort of slide forward.

00:41:31.160 --> 00:41:32.810
MARISHA: Did I say something? I don't know.

00:41:32.810 --> 00:41:36.880
TALIESIN: No, you didn't say anything.

00:41:36.880 --> 00:41:42.370
LAURA: Trees, you're so lovely, even though you're
covered in this black stuff, I can tell that you

00:41:42.370 --> 00:41:44.970
have really good personalities.

00:41:44.970 --> 00:41:46.870
MARISHA: You've clearly been moisturizing.

00:41:46.870 --> 00:41:48.140
TRAVIS: You really don't think that's--

00:41:48.140 --> 00:41:49.930
MATT: All the branches begin to slowly sag down.

00:41:49.930 --> 00:41:52.030
LAURA: Shit! I push off, we're flying, we're
hovering.

00:41:52.030 --> 00:41:53.640
MATT: And you guys all begin to slide down--

00:41:53.640 --> 00:41:55.400
TALIESIN: I'm going to make a jump to another
tree.

00:41:55.400 --> 00:41:56.530
MARISHA: Yeah, I do the same.

00:41:56.530 --> 00:41:58.400
MATT: Okay, make an athletics check, both of you.

00:41:58.400 --> 00:41:59.640
SAM: I will too.

00:41:59.640 --> 00:42:01.240
LAURA: What about you, Grog?

00:42:01.240 --> 00:42:02.370
MARISHA: Oh my god. This is horrifying.

00:42:02.370 --> 00:42:05.550
TALIESIN: Oh my god.

00:42:05.550 --> 00:42:06.590
TRAVIS: All right, I'll try.

00:42:06.590 --> 00:42:07.560
MARISHA: Ten.

00:42:07.560 --> 00:42:09.270
TALIESIN: My potion has worn off, hasn't it?

00:42:09.270 --> 00:42:11.120
MATT: At this point in time? How long does it
last?

00:42:11.120 --> 00:42:13.070
TALIESIN: One hour.

00:42:13.070 --> 00:42:15.410
MATT: Yeah.

00:42:15.410 --> 00:42:18.120
TRAVIS: I frenzy raged last time.

00:42:18.120 --> 00:42:20.650
MATT: Yeah, so you have disadvantage.

00:42:20.650 --> 00:42:22.310
SAM: You're dead, sir.

00:42:22.310 --> 00:42:24.900
LAURA: Oh no.

00:42:24.900 --> 00:42:26.340
TRAVIS: Don't worry about it.

00:42:26.340 --> 00:42:28.360
LAURA: Oh my god, you rolled 19 twice in a row.

00:42:28.360 --> 00:42:29.530
TRAVIS: Yeah, 19 and 16.

00:42:29.530 --> 00:42:30.690
LAURA: Oh, okay.

00:42:30.690 --> 00:42:31.780
TRAVIS: 24.

00:42:31.780 --> 00:42:33.840
MATT: Okay, so you leap onto another tree branch.

00:42:33.840 --> 00:42:35.190
SAM: I got a 23.

00:42:35.190 --> 00:42:37.490
MATT: You also leap after and actually land next
to Grog.

00:42:37.490 --> 00:42:38.260
SAM: Hey, buddy!

00:42:38.260 --> 00:42:39.620
GROG: Hey, pal!

00:42:39.620 --> 00:42:40.700
MATT: What did you get, Percy?

00:42:40.700 --> 00:42:41.540
TALIESIN: Seven.

00:42:41.540 --> 00:42:42.360
LAURA: Oh no.

00:42:42.360 --> 00:42:43.050
MARISHA: 10.

00:42:43.050 --> 00:42:43.850
LAURA: Oh no!

00:42:43.850 --> 00:42:46.110
MATT: You both reach, leap for the branch,
but you're a good foot and a half, two feet

00:42:46.110 --> 00:42:48.120
short, and as your fingers catch the edge--

00:42:48.120 --> 00:42:49.160
MARISHA: Percy, catch me!

00:42:49.160 --> 00:42:55.000
MATT: It's slick, and both of you go plummeting
about 15 feet to the ground. You both suffer four

00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:58.940
points of falling damage as you catch yourself on
the ground, kind of jamming your ankles a little

00:42:58.940 --> 00:43:06.100
bit. There's a (splash) of liquid as you impact
and the lower patch goes partway up your calf,

00:43:06.100 --> 00:43:09.010
almost to your knee, as you hit and you have to
wiggle to try and--

00:43:09.010 --> 00:43:11.770
TALIESIN: I want the mansion, now.

00:43:11.770 --> 00:43:12.580
SAM: Okay.

00:43:12.580 --> 00:43:16.330
LAURA: Can we drop the endless rope down, say,
hey, grab on.

00:43:16.330 --> 00:43:17.340
MATT: Yeah.

00:43:17.340 --> 00:43:19.380
LAURA: And try to yank 'em back up into the tree.

00:43:19.380 --> 00:43:21.320
MATT: Okay. You guys take the rope and begin to
pull yourself up.

00:43:21.320 --> 00:43:23.030
You feel your branch begin to slowly--

00:43:23.030 --> 00:43:24.180
LAURA: Oh, I was on the broom.

00:43:24.180 --> 00:43:25.300
MATT: You're still on the broom this whole time?

00:43:25.300 --> 00:43:27.280
LAURA: I've been on the broom, yeah, I don't wanna
stand on anything.

00:43:27.280 --> 00:43:29.570
MATT: All right. Then you manage to get the rope
down, you guys grab onto the rope and you pull

00:43:29.570 --> 00:43:36.810
them ever so slowly out of the muck. It's a lot of
weight. I need you to make a strength check.

00:43:36.810 --> 00:43:40.600
LAURA: Can I tie the rope off on a branch?

00:43:40.600 --> 00:43:41.810
TALIESIN: It won't hold.

00:43:41.810 --> 00:43:43.150
LIAM: Can I help?

00:43:43.150 --> 00:43:47.530
MATT: Sure. Sure, we can do that. You don't need a
strength check to tie the rope off, we'll just

00:43:47.530 --> 00:43:54.760
take it. You guys manage to pull yourselves at
least out of the muck, however, you've gotta climb

00:43:54.760 --> 00:43:58.130
up the rope to try and get back in the branches?

00:43:58.130 --> 00:43:59.400
TALIESIN: I'm just gonna hold on.

00:43:59.400 --> 00:44:00.860
LAURA: We just need to get in the fucking
mansion.

00:44:00.860 --> 00:44:02.040
TALIESIN: We just need to get in the mansion.

00:44:02.040 --> 00:44:03.200
MARISHA: Yeah, can we have the mansion?

00:44:03.200 --> 00:44:04.730
SAM: Okay, I'll do the mansion.

00:44:04.730 --> 00:44:06.260
MARISHA: I mean, we can still come in and out of
the mansion.

00:44:06.260 --> 00:44:07.290
SAM: Yeah, that's true, that's true.

00:44:07.290 --> 00:44:09.040
MATT: All right.

00:44:09.040 --> 00:44:14.860
SAM: I will cast the mansion. I will sing the song
to conjure it.

00:44:14.860 --> 00:44:21.640
(Sings) Home, home on the range,
where the trees are acting real strange,

00:44:21.640 --> 00:44:26.670
where chickens are pecked,
Vex shoots me in the neck,

00:44:26.670 --> 00:44:29.870
and the hot tub is filled with grenades.

00:44:29.870 --> 00:44:33.130
(All laugh and applaud.)

00:44:33.130 --> 00:44:35.290
MATT: Well done.

00:44:35.290 --> 00:44:39.700
TRAVIS: I'm sick, don't make me laugh that hard.

00:44:39.700 --> 00:44:48.210
MATT: All right. With that, Scanlan, after leaping
onto the next branch, you create the doorway into

00:44:48.210 --> 00:44:52.460
the mansion up in the trees. You guys all slowly
eventually climb back up and get to where the

00:44:52.460 --> 00:44:57.610
entrance is, and each member of Vox Machina
currently present leap into the mansion,

00:44:57.610 --> 00:45:00.310
to safety, where it's seemingly much more clean,
though

00:45:00.310 --> 00:45:03.880
you are dragging clumps of this liquid on
the main carpet.

00:45:03.880 --> 00:45:04.810
TRAVIS: That's good.

00:45:04.810 --> 00:45:05.880
TALIESIN: It's fine.

00:45:05.880 --> 00:45:07.810
SAM: I command my servants to wipe our feet.

00:45:07.810 --> 00:45:11.330
TRAVIS: Whoa whoa whoa, I'm sure you want to test
the gunk, right, Percy?

00:45:11.330 --> 00:45:12.770
LAURA: Yeah, we should--

00:45:12.770 --> 00:45:13.940
SAM: Oh, go out and test it?

00:45:13.940 --> 00:45:17.140
TRAVIS: Is it flammable, is it poisonous,
is it acidic?

00:45:17.140 --> 00:45:21.120
MARISHA: I take my fire hands and I see if I can
light the gunk on fire.

00:45:21.120 --> 00:45:26.870
MATT: Okay. As you bring it near, the gunk does
not burn. You see one little pssh as a bubble

00:45:26.870 --> 00:45:32.160
bursts and there is a little burst of sulfurous
flame, but it burns away in an instant, the actual

00:45:32.160 --> 00:45:33.990
liquid itself does not catch.

00:45:33.990 --> 00:45:39.200
MARISHA: Okay. I start taking my short rest.

00:45:39.200 --> 00:45:40.680
MATT: All right.

00:45:40.680 --> 00:45:42.800
LAURA: Should one of us lick it?

00:45:42.800 --> 00:45:45.460
TALIESIN: Sure.

00:45:45.460 --> 00:45:47.840
SAM: Grog?

00:45:47.840 --> 00:45:51.150
TRAVIS: I take a pinky-smear--

00:45:51.150 --> 00:45:53.270
LIAM: Give it to Mikey, he'll try anything.

00:45:53.270 --> 00:46:00.520
TRAVIS: Like a droplet, right, I stick my tongue
out, and I touch it to my tongue.

00:46:00.520 --> 00:46:06.720
MATT: It resembles, and it's only familiar to you
because you've tried this before, it's like

00:46:06.720 --> 00:46:13.790
tasting the filthiest copper coin you've ever held
in a pocket before. It has that kind of metallic

00:46:13.790 --> 00:46:21.290
residue to it, but also this kind of earthy
griminess where it's probably been devoured and

00:46:21.290 --> 00:46:23.870
digested by a number of creatures before it found
its way--

00:46:23.870 --> 00:46:24.630
LAURA: Ew!

00:46:24.630 --> 00:46:26.440
TRAVIS: I detect a note of digestive tract.

00:46:26.440 --> 00:46:28.460
MATT: It is not pleasant by any means.

00:46:28.460 --> 00:46:31.610
LAURA: Do you feel evil? More than usual?

00:46:31.610 --> 00:46:33.880
TRAVIS: I raise my hand-- no.

00:46:33.880 --> 00:46:36.470
LAURA: Okay.

00:46:36.470 --> 00:46:39.130
TALIESIN: Give me a little bit and I'll do
something to it. I don't really know what I can

00:46:39.130 --> 00:46:40.710
tell you, but I'll take a look.

00:46:40.710 --> 00:46:43.450
LAURA: Hold out your hand, then.

00:46:43.450 --> 00:46:51.360
TALIESIN: Thank you. I need that tree as well,
let's take that down to-- want to help me with

00:46:51.360 --> 00:46:54.240
this before your nap or after?

00:46:54.240 --> 00:46:58.240
MARISHA: I dunno. After.

00:46:58.240 --> 00:47:00.420
TALIESIN: All right, I'll start on it, then you
can help when you finish.

00:47:00.420 --> 00:47:02.560
MATT: All right, so you guys begin...

00:47:02.560 --> 00:47:04.960
TALIESIN: I'm gonna go work for a little bit.

00:47:04.960 --> 00:47:07.850
MATT: Okay. What are the rest of you doing?

00:47:07.850 --> 00:47:14.570
LIAM: I'm gonna hobble past Vex and say, you know,
I think that broom is not as well-suited for, um,

00:47:14.570 --> 00:47:22.470
men. I think you might have done Gern a favor.
I've just taken a very long spin class.

00:47:22.470 --> 00:47:25.850
I sort of tenderly walk past.

00:47:25.850 --> 00:47:28.920
LAURA: Well, I have a seat, sorry I didn't think
about.

00:47:28.920 --> 00:47:32.110
LIAM: Oh dear.

00:47:32.110 --> 00:47:36.340
MATT: So Vax goes to rest his bruised arch.

00:47:36.340 --> 00:47:41.630
(All laugh.)

00:47:41.630 --> 00:47:43.630
MARISHA: Is that enough time?

00:47:43.630 --> 00:47:45.110
MATT: You're making those--

00:47:45.110 --> 00:47:46.390
TALIESIN: I'm gonna make swamp shoes.

00:47:46.390 --> 00:47:47.790
MATT: Okay, that's gonna take you--

00:47:47.790 --> 00:47:50.470
TALIESIN: They're very simple, but yes, I have to
make a lot of them.

00:47:50.470 --> 00:47:52.370
MATT: You have to make a pair for most everybody
here.

00:47:52.370 --> 00:47:56.720
TALIESIN: And I'm going to be enlisting her help,
it's literally just thin slices, I'm not making

00:47:56.720 --> 00:47:58.790
them super nice, I'm just--

00:47:58.790 --> 00:48:00.630
MARISHA: I druidcraft the shit out of those.

00:48:00.630 --> 00:48:02.450
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm gonna have her--

00:48:02.450 --> 00:48:05.110
LAURA: I'm gonna come out of the door with you.

00:48:05.110 --> 00:48:07.300
TALIESIN: That's pretty much what I'm doing other
than sleeping.

00:48:07.300 --> 00:48:10.690
MATT: Okay, go ahead and make four tinkering
checks.

00:48:10.690 --> 00:48:19.740
SAM: I'm gonna inspire him once with an
inspirational quote.

00:48:19.740 --> 00:48:22.610
You have to look through the
rain to see the rainbow.

00:48:22.610 --> 00:48:25.100
(All laugh.)

00:48:25.100 --> 00:48:27.130
TRAVIS: I gotta leave, I can't--

00:48:27.130 --> 00:48:32.450
TALIESIN: I have to take a negative 10 for that,
like that really removes 10?

00:48:32.450 --> 00:48:34.620
MARISHA: Did you get that from a fortune cookie,
where'd you get that?

00:48:34.620 --> 00:48:35.380
TRAVIS: I can't be here when this happens.

00:48:35.380 --> 00:48:39.450
SAM: Hey, pal. Life is what happens when you're
making other plans.

00:48:39.450 --> 00:48:44.120
If plan A doesn't work,
there's still 25 letters left in the alphabet.

00:48:44.120 --> 00:48:45.230
LAURA: Oh, wow.

00:48:45.230 --> 00:48:46.320
TRAVIS: Oh my god.

00:48:46.320 --> 00:48:47.990
LAURA: That's three inspirations you've just given
him.

00:48:47.990 --> 00:48:49.280
TALIESIN: Let's burn that page.

00:48:49.280 --> 00:48:51.370
MATT: That's borderline Lisa Frank quotes here,
this is...

00:48:51.370 --> 00:48:54.170
LIAM: Kill him!

00:48:54.170 --> 00:48:58.320
TALIESIN: Can I remove that extra two from your
charisma? I'm gonna wipe it out.

00:48:58.320 --> 00:49:00.810
MATT: Yeah, all that reading finally goes to
shit.

00:49:00.810 --> 00:49:03.310
SAM: It was my footprints you saw.

00:49:03.310 --> 00:49:06.230
TALIESIN: It's proficiency bonus, plus dex.

00:49:06.230 --> 00:49:07.670
MATT: Yes, go for it.

00:49:07.670 --> 00:49:10.080
SAM: I was carrying you all along.

00:49:10.080 --> 00:49:16.470
TALIESIN: I hate you. I hate everything that you
stand for. Oh, this is nice. This is, um.

00:49:16.470 --> 00:49:19.390
MATT: Remember, you don't have to use the
inspiration dice if you don't want to.

00:49:19.390 --> 00:49:20.770
TALIESIN: It's two 26s.

00:49:20.770 --> 00:49:21.810
MATT: Okay.

00:49:21.810 --> 00:49:26.270
TALIESIN: I'm keeping the inspiration dice.
And, let's see, and two 19s.

00:49:26.270 --> 00:49:31.810
MATT: All righty. Yeah, you guys take the better
part of the next hour to make some loosely

00:49:31.810 --> 00:49:37.410
functional swamp shoes. They'll get you a short
distance, they're not gonna last you a long time.

00:49:37.410 --> 00:49:39.570
TALIESIN: They're not pretty. They're made of
rope.

00:49:39.570 --> 00:49:42.670
MATT: Yeah. All right. So you finish your short
rest.

00:49:42.670 --> 00:49:44.780
MARISHA: I really wanna swan dive into the muck.

00:49:44.780 --> 00:49:48.710
LAURA: I feel like, Keyleth, a swan dive is maybe
not the best idea because I feel like it'll make a

00:49:48.710 --> 00:49:51.340
lot of noise. Maybe nice and quiet.

00:49:51.340 --> 00:49:56.850
MARISHA: If I tighten my abs and keep my feet
together, it shouldn't make much noise at all.

00:49:56.850 --> 00:49:58.290
TALIESIN: You've been watching a lot of Olympics.

00:49:58.290 --> 00:50:00.190
MARISHA: I have been watching a lot of Olympics.

00:50:00.190 --> 00:50:03.900
LIAM: I come back in with a big bag of ice.

00:50:03.900 --> 00:50:07.300
MATT: And two spirits trying to hold it for you.

00:50:07.300 --> 00:50:09.540
TRAVIS: Did we take a long rest or just a short
rest?

00:50:09.540 --> 00:50:11.770
LAURA: Short rest right now so Keyleth can go into
the muck.

00:50:11.770 --> 00:50:13.870
TALIESIN: I'm going for a full long rest after my
crap.

00:50:13.870 --> 00:50:17.570
LAURA: I'm gonna go outside with her and just
hover on the broom to keep an eye.

00:50:17.570 --> 00:50:22.390
SAM: I'm going out as well and I'm just sort of
shuffling in place and moving.

00:50:22.390 --> 00:50:23.880
LAURA: Do you wanna hang out on the broom with
me?

00:50:23.880 --> 00:50:25.460
SAM: Oh yes, that would be better.

00:50:25.460 --> 00:50:27.410
MATT: All right, so the two of you on the broom.
Grog, what are you doing?

00:50:27.410 --> 00:50:30.900
TRAVIS: I'm going into the kitchen with the
Titanstone Knuckles,

00:50:30.900 --> 00:50:33.980
and I'm gonna start hitting things.

00:50:33.980 --> 00:50:35.730
LAURA: Wow, Grog's getting aggressive.

00:50:35.730 --> 00:50:39.310
TRAVIS: Well, I wanna see if I can upgrade the
knuckles, so I'm gonna start using them.

00:50:39.310 --> 00:50:41.520
LAURA: Oh, smart. Smart.

00:50:41.520 --> 00:50:45.300
SAM: I have a training basement, but okay, sure.

00:50:45.300 --> 00:50:47.360
TALIESIN: And there's food.

00:50:47.360 --> 00:50:50.420
MATT: You guys make your way to the front door,
in the distance you can hear a series of dull

00:50:50.420 --> 00:50:56.080
thuds, bangs, cracks, and various sounds as Grog
begins to just punch his way through the entirety

00:50:56.080 --> 00:50:57.120
of your mansion's kitchen.

00:50:57.120 --> 00:50:58.640
LAURA: Do you wanna check on that?

00:50:58.640 --> 00:50:59.880
SAM: Seems like it's normal.

00:50:59.880 --> 00:51:02.730
LAURA: All right.

00:51:02.730 --> 00:51:07.970
MATT: You doubt you'd ever see a fully dominated
spiritual servant look nervous, yet at this moment

00:51:07.970 --> 00:51:13.950
you have about 17 of them all just going
(high-pitched whine).

00:51:13.950 --> 00:51:15.670
You just tear through the vicinity.

00:51:15.670 --> 00:51:16.980
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:51:16.980 --> 00:51:19.960
MATT: You're trying desperately to finish up your
short rest, as you get up, you hear this noise as

00:51:19.960 --> 00:51:23.320
well as you guys make your way to the front door.
You're left to try and finish up this project,

00:51:23.320 --> 00:51:26.390
probably for the next 20 minutes or so,
while they go ahead and attempt this process.

00:51:26.390 --> 00:51:28.540
Vax, you're resting up your loins with ice.

00:51:28.540 --> 00:51:33.580
LIAM: No, I mean, I'm gonna take my bag of ice and
I'm gonna sit on the doorjamb and watch them go.

00:51:33.580 --> 00:51:36.060
And just see if they need help, but I'll
stay here if I can.

00:51:36.060 --> 00:51:39.070
MATT: All right. You.

00:51:39.070 --> 00:51:42.400
LAURA: Scanlan, do you wanna actually sit on my
lap so you don't have to suffer through the

00:51:42.400 --> 00:51:44.910
indignity that Vax just did?

00:51:44.910 --> 00:51:47.710
SAM: Yes, that would be lovely, thank you.

00:51:47.710 --> 00:51:49.360
MATT: All right, so as you guys step out,
Keyleth.

00:51:49.360 --> 00:51:51.020
SAM: Will you tell me a story?

00:51:51.020 --> 00:51:52.740
LAURA: Whatever you want, darling.

00:51:52.800 --> 00:51:58.450
MATT: Keyleth, as you step off of the tree branch,
are you gonna climb down

00:51:58.450 --> 00:51:59.980
or just leap down into the muck?

00:51:59.980 --> 00:52:07.200
MARISHA: I swan-dive. I take a minute to compose
myself. And then--

00:52:07.200 --> 00:52:08.340
LAURA: You're earth elemental?

00:52:08.340 --> 00:52:11.390
MARISHA: --as gracefully as possible, pull like a
Pocahontas,

00:52:11.390 --> 00:52:14.880
and then turn into the earth elemental
as I dive in.

00:52:14.880 --> 00:52:15.980
TALIESIN: Sail!

00:52:15.980 --> 00:52:17.020
MARISHA: Sail!

00:52:17.020 --> 00:52:22.630
MATT: All right, as you do, your form suddenly
ripples and extends out into the form of your

00:52:22.630 --> 00:52:30.340
elemental body. You slam into the surface and sink
down below. You guys see a slight (burble sound)

00:52:30.340 --> 00:52:40.130
in the liquid, and it leaves this sort of crater
of splash that slowly closes up over with no sign

00:52:40.130 --> 00:52:42.260
of Keyleth now visible on the surface.

00:52:42.260 --> 00:52:46.940
LAURA: I'm gonna hand Vax the endless rope and
say, you might just wanna drop that down to the

00:52:46.940 --> 00:52:49.690
muck so she can get out if she needs it. Maybe.
Like fish for her.

00:52:49.690 --> 00:52:52.390
LIAM: Yeah, I go and I tie one end of it to the
heaviest piece

00:52:52.390 --> 00:52:55.050
of furniture I can find in the
foyer.

00:52:55.050 --> 00:52:59.990
MATT: All right. No heavy furniture per se,
but there are a series of large marble pillars

00:52:59.990 --> 00:53:03.280
that are load-bearing within the interior,
and that's probably your best bet, so you go

00:53:03.280 --> 00:53:04.910
ahead and wrap the rope around that.

00:53:04.910 --> 00:53:07.110
LIAM: Yes, I use the swirly-whirly knot.

00:53:07.110 --> 00:53:11.160
MATT: Great. The one that Pike taught you from her
sailing days.

00:53:11.160 --> 00:53:21.370
MARISHA: I start to earthglide, breaststroking
through the mud under the swamp to the tree.

00:53:21.370 --> 00:53:22.890
LAURA: To the tree, you're going to the tree?

00:53:22.890 --> 00:53:24.890
MARISHA: I'm heading towards it.

00:53:24.890 --> 00:53:25.960
SAM: Wait, hold up.

00:53:25.960 --> 00:53:29.110
MATT: Swimming through the tar itself is a slowing
process even as an earth elemental. Earthgliding

00:53:29.110 --> 00:53:35.400
would mean going subterranean to where the actual
physical earth and soil is what you can traverse

00:53:35.400 --> 00:53:38.690
through. The tar is not natural in comparison to
your elemental form,

00:53:38.690 --> 00:53:41.030
so you'd have to go beneath the actual bog.

00:53:41.030 --> 00:53:43.660
MARISHA: How much further down is it?

00:53:43.660 --> 00:53:48.430
MATT: I'd say it's probably anywhere from three to
five feet, depending on certain things, that's to

00:53:48.430 --> 00:53:51.310
get past how much of it has seeped into the
ground.

00:53:51.310 --> 00:53:53.050
MARISHA: Okay, then I go down.

00:53:53.050 --> 00:53:55.690
MATT: Okay. You go down, and you have to get lower
the closer you get to it, as the actual seep,

00:53:55.690 --> 00:54:05.400
the actual depth in which this substance seems to
have penetrated the dirt gets lower and lower.

00:54:05.400 --> 00:54:10.320
You begin to move through as you glide in the
darkness.

00:54:10.320 --> 00:54:12.650
SAM: You know what, we should've definitely tied
that rope to her before--

00:54:12.650 --> 00:54:16.330
LAURA: Yeah, before she went in, yeah yeah yeah.

00:54:16.330 --> 00:54:19.840
MARISHA: I wanna use my tremor-sense too to just
be aware.

00:54:19.840 --> 00:54:26.030
MATT: Yeah, every now and then you feel a twitch,
a large twitch in the ground, and you kind of

00:54:26.030 --> 00:54:32.200
shoulder-charger into what seems to be a large
root that is dug into the ground. And you start

00:54:32.200 --> 00:54:36.800
finding little pockets here and there beneath
these roots of that awful tar-like substance that

00:54:36.800 --> 00:54:44.720
have just been pushed into the ground like these
little tar geodes, if you will. You start feeling

00:54:44.720 --> 00:54:51.400
around and finding these large roots that are just
a heavy network of chaos beneath the tree.

00:54:51.400 --> 00:54:57.610
You're now under the tree, probably a good 25,
30 feet below it.

00:54:57.610 --> 00:55:01.790
MARISHA: Okay. If I reach and out touch one of the
roots,

00:55:01.790 --> 00:55:04.450
like just run my hand along it, what happens?

00:55:04.450 --> 00:55:05.820
SAM: God, what is she doing?

00:55:05.820 --> 00:55:07.030
TALIESIN: You're my hero.

00:55:07.030 --> 00:55:11.410
MATT: You run your hand along the root. It's
stiff, the surface of the bark itself is a little

00:55:11.410 --> 00:55:20.270
rough at the touch. Yeah.

00:55:20.270 --> 00:55:22.170
TALIESIN: Sorry. I just love that word.

00:55:22.170 --> 00:55:26.060
SAM: Dick joke.

00:55:26.060 --> 00:55:33.200
MARISHA: I move back a little bit, kind of getting
away from the tree.

00:55:33.200 --> 00:55:40.220
MATT: Okay, glide backward, away from that large
root that you had run into.

00:55:40.220 --> 00:55:45.480
MARISHA: Do I sense any type of creatures living
under here?

00:55:45.480 --> 00:55:47.630
MATT: Not within your vicinity, no.

00:55:47.630 --> 00:55:50.410
MARISHA: Any movement, nothing crazy?

00:55:50.410 --> 00:55:55.180
MATT: Just the occasional shift, like a very faint
movement that's

00:55:55.180 --> 00:56:00.470
rather sudden in certain areas nearby.

00:56:00.470 --> 00:56:02.990
MARISHA: Okay, I'm gonna start making my way back
to the mansion.

00:56:02.990 --> 00:56:04.510
TALIESIN: It was good, it was good.

00:56:04.510 --> 00:56:08.980
MATT: You earthglide back up, you guys, after
waiting a few minutes, suddenly emerging from the

00:56:08.980 --> 00:56:14.610
bottom of the bog, you see Keyleth's now covered
in black tar-like material,

00:56:14.610 --> 00:56:16.600
her elemental form emerges.

00:56:16.600 --> 00:56:18.320
MARISHA: Ooh, like the swamp thing? Do I look like
the swamp thing?

00:56:18.320 --> 00:56:19.180
MATT: Kinda.

00:56:19.180 --> 00:56:20.630
MARISHA: That's cool.

00:56:20.630 --> 00:56:22.200
LAURA: Are you okay?

00:56:22.200 --> 00:56:23.670
MARISHA: (rock noises)

00:56:23.670 --> 00:56:26.340
LAURA: Oh, right. Cool.

00:56:26.340 --> 00:56:29.860
MATT: She talks. It sounds like a slow-moving
rockslide. (rock sounds)

00:56:29.860 --> 00:56:31.440
LAURA: Awesome.

00:56:31.440 --> 00:56:33.870
TALIESIN: Do you speak rock?

00:56:33.870 --> 00:56:41.430
MARISHA: That's very poetic. And then I kind of
make my way up and drop earth elemental form.

00:56:41.430 --> 00:56:46.390
MATT: Okay, as you drop the form, much of the muck
just kind of drops off of where the form once was.

00:56:46.390 --> 00:56:52.800
A little bit's still clinging to the bottom of
your robes, but mostly clean.

00:56:52.800 --> 00:56:58.490
MARISHA: Yeah, I think it's good, I didn't really
see much or learn much more than we already knew.

00:56:58.490 --> 00:57:00.420
LAURA: Did you see any creatures around?

00:57:00.420 --> 00:57:01.340
MARISHA: No creatures.

00:57:01.340 --> 00:57:03.010
SAM: Did the muck try to eat you?

00:57:03.010 --> 00:57:05.670
MARISHA: The muck did not try to eat me.
It's not as deep as I would've thought, actually.

00:57:05.670 --> 00:57:13.650
It's only three feet or so deep. I do believe
that the tree is living, though. I think its roots

00:57:13.650 --> 00:57:17.270
were kind of twitching and moving around.

00:57:17.270 --> 00:57:20.180
SAM: But you felt the roots, it's not an illusion,
it's a real tree.

00:57:20.180 --> 00:57:21.860
MARISHA: It is a real tree.

00:57:21.860 --> 00:57:22.990
SAM: Okay.

00:57:22.990 --> 00:57:25.360
MARISHA: The roots were very turgid.

00:57:25.360 --> 00:57:27.520
SAM: Hmm. What a good word.

00:57:27.520 --> 00:57:30.030
MARISHA: Someone taught that to me earlier.

00:57:30.030 --> 00:57:36.170
TALIESIN: I feel like a terrible person, I think.
It's just a great word, that's all.

00:57:36.170 --> 00:57:38.450
MATT: All right. So with her return, what are you
guys gonna do?

00:57:38.450 --> 00:57:40.320
TRAVIS: (punching sounds)

00:57:40.320 --> 00:57:42.430
LAURA: Do you wanna go, maybe?

00:57:42.430 --> 00:57:45.750
SAM: Yeah, I guess we should go in and see what
going on, what's cooking in the kitchen.

00:57:45.750 --> 00:57:46.670
LAURA: Okay.

00:57:46.670 --> 00:57:50.090
MATT: As you guys rush into the kitchen,
and looking around, you can see now every

00:57:50.090 --> 00:57:54.900
cabinet's pulled off of its hinges and shattered
in half, what was a central stone island is now

00:57:54.900 --> 00:57:57.390
just a pile of smashed granite.

00:57:57.390 --> 00:57:58.600
SAM: Damn it.

00:57:58.600 --> 00:58:04.190
MATT: Every single possible breakable utensil,
platter--

00:58:04.190 --> 00:58:06.050
TRAVIS: Don't forget the holes in the wall.

00:58:06.050 --> 00:58:11.330
MATT: Oh, it is just ruin. You see every servant
is now on the ground trying to scoop things up,

00:58:11.330 --> 00:58:13.510
and as soon as they get a handful to go ahead and
set it somewhere,

00:58:13.510 --> 00:58:18.180
just slapped out of their hand by a fist.

00:58:18.180 --> 00:58:21.400
SAM: Grog, what are you doing? This is our kitchen
and we need to eat dinner here!

00:58:21.400 --> 00:58:27.950
TRAVIS: I'm trying to activate these, and they
require pain. (yells)

00:58:27.950 --> 00:58:33.470
MATT: With that, what was once a large black
cauldron that was used in soup and other sort of

00:58:33.470 --> 00:58:40.100
base-like liquids, is now, pwang, a large heavy
ding is now on the inside in the shape of a fist,

00:58:40.100 --> 00:58:41.580
and it's half as useful.

00:58:41.580 --> 00:58:42.480
LAURA: Grog!

00:58:42.480 --> 00:58:44.650
TRAVIS: Do I notice any difference in the
gauntlets?

00:58:44.650 --> 00:58:48.270
MATT: Make a perception check.

00:58:48.270 --> 00:58:49.860
TRAVIS: At disadvantage?

00:58:49.860 --> 00:58:50.880
LAURA: Because you're super tired.

00:58:50.880 --> 00:58:52.800
MATT: Yes, because you haven't rested yet.

00:58:52.800 --> 00:58:55.400
TRAVIS: One less. Ten.

00:58:55.400 --> 00:58:58.390
MATT: No difference whatsoever.

00:58:58.390 --> 00:59:02.560
TRAVIS: Maybe I need to hit people.

00:59:02.560 --> 00:59:04.270
LIAM: I start backing away slow.

00:59:04.270 --> 00:59:05.920
(All laugh.)

00:59:05.920 --> 00:59:09.010
TALIESIN: I walk in at this point and I'm just
looking for some chicken.

00:59:09.010 --> 00:59:11.860
MARISHA: I also walk in. Scanlan!

00:59:11.860 --> 00:59:13.820
LAURA: Oh, you're not an earth elemental anymore.

00:59:13.820 --> 00:59:15.050
MARISHA: Are you remodeling?

00:59:15.050 --> 00:59:15.930
LAURA: That's too bad.

00:59:15.930 --> 00:59:21.350
SAM: I didn't intend to, but Grog has forgotten
that I have a whole training ground downstairs

00:59:21.350 --> 00:59:27.550
that he could've used. Grog, if you need to hit
something, someone,

00:59:27.550 --> 00:59:31.400
I can give you a few of the servants.

00:59:31.400 --> 00:59:32.630
TRAVIS: Would you?

00:59:32.630 --> 00:59:34.750
SAM: Sure, I've got like a hundred of them.

00:59:34.750 --> 00:59:35.610
TRAVIS: How many?

00:59:35.610 --> 00:59:36.690
SAM: You guys don't mind, do you?

00:59:36.690 --> 00:59:38.330
LAURA: Wait, do they feel pain?

00:59:38.330 --> 00:59:41.670
MATT: They all turn to you and kinda go.

00:59:41.670 --> 00:59:43.310
TRAVIS: How many can I have?

00:59:43.310 --> 00:59:45.400
SAM: Have a dozen. Baker's dozen.

00:59:45.400 --> 00:59:47.030
TRAVIS: I go into the next room.

00:59:47.030 --> 00:59:48.360
TALIESIN: A dozen bakers.

00:59:48.360 --> 00:59:49.600
TRAVIS: With the dozen servants.

00:59:49.600 --> 00:59:52.000
LAURA: Go downstairs, Grog!

00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:54.400
TRAVIS: What if a change happens, don't you wanna
be there?

00:59:54.400 --> 00:59:56.060
LAURA: All right, yeah.

00:59:56.060 --> 01:00:00.220
LIAM: Scanlan, does your house unbreak itself if
Grog breaks it, you know, if it goes away,

01:00:00.220 --> 01:00:03.890
it poofs and it comes back, is all his damage
there or does it--

01:00:03.890 --> 01:00:07.640
TRAVIS: Please. Grog always leaves his mark.

01:00:07.640 --> 01:00:13.930
SAM: The damage, I believe, I've never seen damage
this bad in our place before, but. I believe it

01:00:13.930 --> 01:00:17.000
will reset. It goes back to normal at the end.

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.100
MATT: We'll find out.

01:00:19.100 --> 01:00:21.070
LAURA: We haven't looked at the spa since we
destroyed it.

01:00:21.070 --> 01:00:22.910
SAM: I haven't been down to the spa in a while.

01:00:22.910 --> 01:00:26.260
TRAVIS: I pick up one of the servants by the head
and I try and crush his head.

01:00:26.260 --> 01:00:27.790
LAURA: Oh, no!

01:00:27.790 --> 01:00:30.350
MATT: Your fingers pass through its spectral form.
There's no actual--

01:00:30.350 --> 01:00:33.610
TRAVIS: Make yourself grabbable.

01:00:33.610 --> 01:00:34.930
SAM: You have to try harder, Grog.

01:00:34.930 --> 01:00:36.600
MATT: Passes through again.

01:00:36.600 --> 01:00:43.950
TRAVIS: Fix this. You fix this now. I will break
more stuff.

01:00:43.950 --> 01:00:46.200
SAM: I thought that would work, honestly.

01:00:46.200 --> 01:00:47.530
TALIESIN: Is Keyleth still covered in goop?

01:00:47.530 --> 01:00:48.510
TRAVIS: I punched the cow before.

01:00:48.510 --> 01:00:49.820
LAURA: You did punch a cow.

01:00:49.820 --> 01:00:50.860
MARISHA: I kinda fwooshed it off.

01:00:50.860 --> 01:00:51.880
TALIESIN: Do you have any left on you?

01:00:51.880 --> 01:00:54.760
LIAM: Grog, he doesn't want you to know this,
he told me this the last time you were here,

01:00:54.760 --> 01:00:59.900
you actually have to do that 33 times before it
takes hold, so just keep going.

01:00:59.900 --> 01:01:04.160
TRAVIS: I grab again. I grab again. I grab again.
I grab again.

01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:11.000
MATT: As you keep going, you're not even sure
quite what a 33 is, but you just keep going.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:18.290
The servant stands there, its kind of loosely
formless face, other than you can see eyes,

01:01:18.290 --> 01:01:22.340
a nose, and a mouth, but the features are very
plain and translucent,

01:01:22.340 --> 01:01:26.360
just stay wide and staring straight at you.

01:01:26.360 --> 01:01:28.970
TRAVIS: Fine, fine. Bring me a cow.

01:01:28.970 --> 01:01:31.570
LAURA: Ohh.

01:01:31.640 --> 01:01:33.820
SAM: We usually have one cow.

01:01:33.820 --> 01:01:36.430
MATT: The servants vanish and come back,
you hear a familiar (dinging).

01:01:36.430 --> 01:01:38.890
LAURA: No, I hated it when you punched the cow!

01:01:38.890 --> 01:01:40.170
TRAVIS: No, no, no.

01:01:40.170 --> 01:01:41.800
TALIESIN: I'm going back to my room.

01:01:41.800 --> 01:01:44.010
TRAVIS: It's time to ring this bell.

01:01:44.010 --> 01:01:45.150
LAURA: No.

01:01:45.150 --> 01:01:46.440
TRAVIS: I beat the shit out of the cow.

01:01:46.440 --> 01:01:48.210
(All groan.)

01:01:48.210 --> 01:01:51.190
LAURA: That is awful. I leave, I can't watch,
I go and look for chicken.

01:01:51.190 --> 01:01:55.450
SAM: Before you beat this poor senseless cow--

01:01:55.450 --> 01:01:57.610
TRAVIS: It's a purple, like, ethereal cow.

01:01:57.610 --> 01:01:59.140
MATT: Yeah.

01:01:59.140 --> 01:02:01.120
LAURA: It's still a cow, it's still a cow, don't.

01:02:01.120 --> 01:02:06.540
TRAVIS: I'm gonna rocky ribs the shit out of this
cow.

01:02:06.540 --> 01:02:09.870
LIAM: Street Fighter it?

01:02:09.870 --> 01:02:16.520
MATT: Bonus round. You take the next half an hour,
beating the non-living crap out of this spectral

01:02:16.520 --> 01:02:22.800
cow, which, every impact has a sound hit.
Does not seem to react in pain as much as

01:02:22.800 --> 01:02:28.820
(distressed mooing). There's no physical damage
seen upon its form, it just gets knocked around.

01:02:28.820 --> 01:02:29.440
LAURA: That's good.

01:02:29.440 --> 01:02:34.410
SAM: I've got an idea. I can fix this, Grog,
I want you to be a satisfied customer. Let's go

01:02:34.410 --> 01:02:35.730
downstairs.

01:02:35.730 --> 01:02:36.600
TRAVIS: Okay.

01:02:36.600 --> 01:02:37.850
SAM: Okay. I take him downstairs.

01:02:37.850 --> 01:02:38.880
MATT: All right.

01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:45.860
SAM: I say, you're gonna punch me and keep
punching me as long as you can. All right?

01:02:45.860 --> 01:02:46.920
TRAVIS: Are you sure?

01:02:46.920 --> 01:02:50.790
SAM: And I transform into a triceratops.

01:02:50.790 --> 01:02:53.730
LAURA: Awesome.

01:02:53.730 --> 01:02:56.320
MARISHA: I go downstairs to watch.

01:02:56.320 --> 01:02:59.300
TRAVIS: Is this my day-birth or something?

01:02:59.300 --> 01:03:02.200
SAM: Birthday. I mean, (growls)

01:03:02.200 --> 01:03:06.440
MATT: Yes, as you hear the growling creature
you've never seen before in your life, horns

01:03:06.440 --> 01:03:12.120
protruding from the front of its bony, armored
headpiece, its scaled armored body standing before

01:03:12.120 --> 01:03:18.860
you, massive, snorting, you just start punching
the crap out of it.

01:03:18.860 --> 01:03:20.840
TRAVIS: Yeah. Rage-punching.

01:03:20.840 --> 01:03:24.790
(All singing Jurassic Park theme.)

01:03:24.790 --> 01:03:26.530
SAM: I'm gonna fight back a little.

01:03:26.530 --> 01:03:31.440
MATT: A little bit? All right. You guys do begin
to scrap back and forth for the next ten minutes.

01:03:31.440 --> 01:03:35.150
'Cause it takes ten minutes of solid punching and
missing for Grog to eventually whittle your

01:03:35.150 --> 01:03:42.560
triceratops hitpoints down to zero. However,
in the process, you do manage to get a bit gored,

01:03:42.560 --> 01:03:46.650
suffering a total of nine points of piercing
damage throughout the entirety of this, just

01:03:46.650 --> 01:03:52.190
little scrapes and scratches, the occasional
puncture wound, but eventually you get one solid

01:03:52.190 --> 01:03:57.860
crack with the gauntlets across his face,
and the triceratops form shifts back down to a

01:03:57.860 --> 01:04:01.100
tiny little Scanlan Shorthalt.

01:04:01.100 --> 01:04:03.180
LAURA: Don't hit him, don't hit him!

01:04:03.180 --> 01:04:11.110
SAM: Wait, wait, did it work? Are your gauntlets
better or whatever you're trying to do?

01:04:11.110 --> 01:04:12.500
TRAVIS: Do I feel anything?

01:04:12.500 --> 01:04:13.610
MATT: Perception check.

01:04:13.610 --> 01:04:17.640
LAURA: You need to rest so you can perceive things
better. Oh.

01:04:17.640 --> 01:04:21.300
TALIESIN: Can you roll lower?

01:04:21.300 --> 01:04:23.470
TRAVIS: I could. There's one number lower.

01:04:23.470 --> 01:04:27.030
(All laugh.)

01:04:27.030 --> 01:04:31.570
MATT: No seeming change whatsoever. Although no
scarring. The good thing about the gauntlets is

01:04:31.570 --> 01:04:33.390
that they're powerful enough where all those
impacts

01:04:33.390 --> 01:04:36.380
don't appear to have scratched or dented
the surface.

01:04:36.380 --> 01:04:38.160
TRAVIS: No.

01:04:38.160 --> 01:04:39.520
SAM: Am I okay?

01:04:39.520 --> 01:04:44.250
MATT: You're a little sore. That last hit did
carry over a little bit, the form didn't absorb

01:04:44.250 --> 01:04:50.790
the entirety of the blow. You did come back with,
uh. Four points of bludgeoning damage to your

01:04:50.790 --> 01:04:56.370
chin, so you're, you know, a little bit of blood
on the corner of your lip that you can taste,

01:04:56.370 --> 01:04:59.750
and your jaw is a little sore on the right side.

01:04:59.750 --> 01:05:04.530
TALIESIN: Just for fun while everything's going
on, I'm running two passive experiments in my lab

01:05:04.530 --> 01:05:06.110
while I'm working on the shoes.

01:05:06.110 --> 01:05:06.830
MATT: Sure.

01:05:06.830 --> 01:05:10.130
MARISHA: Oh, and I help him finish the shoes by
helping druidcraft them.

01:05:10.130 --> 01:05:13.610
TALIESIN: I'm leaving some of the muck on some
chicken that I took from the kitchen to see if it

01:05:13.610 --> 01:05:16.810
has any effect on flesh after a long exposure.

01:05:16.810 --> 01:05:17.880
MATT: Okay.

01:05:17.880 --> 01:05:20.360
TALIESIN: And then I'm distilling some to see if I
can even

01:05:20.360 --> 01:05:22.860
identify anything in there or anything weird.

01:05:22.860 --> 01:05:26.100
MATT: All right. So what are you guys doing now?

01:05:26.100 --> 01:05:29.180
TRAVIS: Being disappointed.

01:05:29.180 --> 01:05:32.260
TALIESIN: Do you have to roll for that?

01:05:32.260 --> 01:05:32.690
MATT: Disadvantage.

01:05:32.690 --> 01:05:33.690
LAURA: Natural 20.

01:05:33.690 --> 01:05:37.830
(All laugh.)

01:05:37.830 --> 01:05:39.490
LAURA: I was saying it, but it really happened!

01:05:39.490 --> 01:05:41.320
TALIESIN: Metaphor! Metaphor!

01:05:41.320 --> 01:05:52.090
SAM: You know what, Grog, you could, it might make
you feel better if you repaid the favor.

01:05:52.090 --> 01:05:56.160
I've been meaning to try to upgrade Mythcarver.

01:05:56.160 --> 01:05:58.730
TRAVIS: Yeah, come get it. Come get it.

01:05:58.730 --> 01:06:05.950
SAM: All right, I'm gonna do a stab. I'm gonna
sing a note and see if this does anything to

01:06:05.950 --> 01:06:11.730
Mythcarver. I'll just go (sings a note) and I'll
try and jam it through his arm.

01:06:11.730 --> 01:06:15.800
MATT: Okay, you hit up a scale of notes,
and one note resonates with the blade, and the

01:06:15.800 --> 01:06:20.570
harmonic resonance kind of causes it to shake ever
so slightly as it kind of amplifies the sound.

01:06:20.570 --> 01:06:21.880
Go ahead and roll an attack.

01:06:21.880 --> 01:06:22.950
LAURA: Oh my god.

01:06:22.950 --> 01:06:25.110
SAM: 18 plus nine.

01:06:25.110 --> 01:06:28.070
MATT: That definitely hits. Go ahead and roll
damage.

01:06:28.070 --> 01:06:37.610
SAM: Uh, not much. 1d8. Three, six, plus one...
ooh, nine!

01:06:37.610 --> 01:06:42.380
MATT: Nine points of damage to you, Grog,
as the blade kinda sinks about four inches

01:06:42.380 --> 01:06:43.730
through one of your pectoral muscles.

01:06:43.730 --> 01:06:46.230
TRAVIS: (grunts)

01:06:46.230 --> 01:06:50.380
SAM: And I will sing as I withdraw it as well.
(sings a note)

01:06:50.380 --> 01:06:55.590
MATT: You pull it out and the blade almost
vibrates as it does, it scatters the blood off of

01:06:55.590 --> 01:06:57.640
its surface as you withdraw it from the wound.

01:06:57.640 --> 01:07:01.560
SAM: Do I notice any change in the weapon?

01:07:01.560 --> 01:07:02.710
MATT: It is bloodless.

01:07:02.710 --> 01:07:03.810
SAM: Damn it.

01:07:03.810 --> 01:07:05.030
MATT: No noticeable change.

01:07:05.030 --> 01:07:05.890
TRAVIS: Nothing?

01:07:05.890 --> 01:07:06.680
MATT: Nothing.

01:07:06.680 --> 01:07:08.550
TRAVIS: You're only gonna do it once?

01:07:08.550 --> 01:07:09.940
SAM: But it hurts you!

01:07:09.940 --> 01:07:13.570
TRAVIS: Nah. Do one more, but like, angry-sing.

01:07:13.570 --> 01:07:19.880
SAM: All right. All right, one more time.
I'll do some like Black Sabbathy sort of

01:07:19.880 --> 01:07:24.130
(heavy metal screaming).

01:07:24.130 --> 01:07:26.070
MATT: (laughs) Go for it.

01:07:26.070 --> 01:07:27.050
SAM: All right.

01:07:27.050 --> 01:07:31.070
MATT: Take advantage on this one because of your
intense singing.

01:07:31.070 --> 01:07:32.380
SAM: 18 plus nine.

01:07:32.380 --> 01:07:34.200
MATT: All right, go ahead and roll damage.

01:07:34.200 --> 01:07:36.370
LAURA: Oh my god.

01:07:36.370 --> 01:07:38.860
SAM: Ooh, yeah, that's better.

01:07:38.860 --> 01:07:40.220
SAM and TALIESIN: Ooh!

01:07:40.220 --> 01:07:41.920
SAM: 15.

01:07:41.920 --> 01:07:43.330
MATT: Shnk! Other pectoral muscle now.

01:07:43.330 --> 01:07:44.510
TRAVIS: (yelps)

01:07:44.510 --> 01:07:48.080
MATT: A matching wound, this one kind of, (yelps),
tickles you a little as it goes a little deeper

01:07:48.080 --> 01:07:52.710
and kinda tickles the outside of a lung.

01:07:52.710 --> 01:07:57.360
SAM: All right. I withdraw. And any change?

01:07:57.360 --> 01:08:02.430
MATT: As you withdraw, it kind of rings with the
pullback, blood scattered, blade is clean,

01:08:02.430 --> 01:08:03.590
no noticeable change.

01:08:03.590 --> 01:08:04.940
SAM: Ah, damn it. All right, forget it.

01:08:04.940 --> 01:08:06.300
TRAVIS: These things don't work.

01:08:06.300 --> 01:08:07.350
SAM: I know, these suck.

01:08:07.350 --> 01:08:10.460
TRAVIS: What are we doing wrong?

01:08:10.460 --> 01:08:14.120
SAM: I don't know. Wish there was a manual.

01:08:14.120 --> 01:08:20.520
TRAVIS: Have we looked for instructions? Is there
writing on the Titanstone Knuckles?

01:08:20.520 --> 01:08:22.940
MATT: There are various carvings on it.

01:08:22.940 --> 01:08:25.200
TRAVIS: Carvings.

01:08:25.200 --> 01:08:27.190
SAM: Anything on mine?

01:08:27.190 --> 01:08:31.370
MATT: There are runes around the base of it.
What languages do you know?

01:08:31.370 --> 01:08:34.700
SAM: Nothing. I know Common and Gnome.

01:08:34.700 --> 01:08:36.360
MATT: Yeah, you don't recognize it.

01:08:36.360 --> 01:08:41.890
LAURA: I'm gonna go up to Grog and cast Cure
Wounds at third level.

01:08:41.890 --> 01:08:47.520
MATT: Okay, go for it, you can roll that up.

01:08:47.520 --> 01:08:49.480
LAURA: Ten whole points of healing.

01:08:49.480 --> 01:08:51.040
TRAVIS: Thanks, man.

01:08:51.040 --> 01:08:52.600
MARISHA: I also go ahead and cure myself up.

01:08:52.600 --> 01:08:53.890
MATT: Okay. All right.

01:08:53.890 --> 01:08:55.160
SAM: We're about to take a rest.

01:08:55.160 --> 01:08:56.000
MARISHA: Eh.

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:57.050
MATT: What else do you guys want to do?

01:08:57.050 --> 01:08:58.240
TRAVIS: I'm gonna long rest now.

01:08:58.240 --> 01:08:59.770
TALIESIN: Long rest, eat some chicken.

01:08:59.770 --> 01:09:02.580
MARISHA: Wait, do we have any vague plan, wait,
we plan at dawn?

01:09:02.580 --> 01:09:04.800
LAURA: We'll plan tomorrow morning.

01:09:04.800 --> 01:09:06.070
MARISHA: We'll plan at dawn.

01:09:06.070 --> 01:09:06.870
TRAVIS: We'll plan at dawn.

01:09:06.870 --> 01:09:10.670
LAURA: I wanna go upstairs and just open the door
and keep an eye out of it for just a little bit

01:09:10.670 --> 01:09:12.910
and see what I see out the doorway.

01:09:12.910 --> 01:09:18.440
MATT: Okay. Make a perception check.

01:09:18.440 --> 01:09:27.360
LAURA: Oh, come on! Oh, um. That would be a 15.

01:09:27.360 --> 01:09:31.240
MATT: 15. All right. How much time do you spend
out there?

01:09:31.240 --> 01:09:32.600
LAURA: Well, at the door?

01:09:32.600 --> 01:09:33.310
MATT: Yeah.

01:09:33.310 --> 01:09:37.360
LAURA: How much time can I spend and still get a
good rest?

01:09:37.360 --> 01:09:42.030
MATT: Well, I mean, you need an eight-hour rest
for a full night's rest, so it depends how much

01:09:42.030 --> 01:09:44.140
time you want to push off until you begin taking
your rest.

01:09:44.140 --> 01:09:46.440
LAURA: Oh, right. Well, how about a couple hours?

01:09:46.440 --> 01:09:50.140
MATT: Okay. First hour, seemingly no real change.
Second hour,

01:09:50.140 --> 01:09:56.220
go ahead and make another perception check.

01:09:56.220 --> 01:09:58.330
LAURA: 17.

01:09:58.330 --> 01:10:08.420
MATT: 17. You do notice a little ways off,
some of the tree brush shifts a little bit,

01:10:08.420 --> 01:10:11.920
and then you see what looks to be a few trees
kind of (fwoosh).

01:10:11.920 --> 01:10:13.060
LAURA: Disappear?

01:10:13.060 --> 01:10:18.580
MATT: Seemingly there's now a hole in the canopy
where once was straight canopy.

01:10:18.580 --> 01:10:20.580
TRAVIS: What do you think that is?

01:10:20.580 --> 01:10:22.020
LAURA: I dunno.

01:10:22.020 --> 01:10:23.720
TRAVIS: Like a giant werewolf maybe?

01:10:23.720 --> 01:10:26.900
LAURA: A giant werewolf eating an entire tree?

01:10:26.900 --> 01:10:29.760
TRAVIS: Tree's not missing.

01:10:29.760 --> 01:10:31.870
LAURA: The tree, like, disappeared?

01:10:31.870 --> 01:10:36.640
MATT: There is now a hole in the canopy where
there was not previously, seemingly the treetops

01:10:36.640 --> 01:10:38.870
that filled that space have kind of moved out of
the way.

01:10:38.870 --> 01:10:40.730
MARISHA: They go straight down?

01:10:40.730 --> 01:10:47.770
LAURA: Oh, I bet something was sitting in the tree
maybe and was keeping still. That could be it.

01:10:47.770 --> 01:10:53.130
Can I look down underneath us and see if the
trees are kind of staying put where we are?

01:10:53.130 --> 01:10:56.660
MATT: Yeah, and glancing about, nothing is really
moving in your vicinity, and the area, the part of

01:10:56.660 --> 01:10:59.520
the canopy that is now missing, is a pretty large
area.

01:10:59.520 --> 01:11:02.000
LAURA: It seems bigger than a creature would be.

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:06.870
MATT: It would probably have been the sudden
removal or shift of multiple trees to leave that

01:11:06.870 --> 01:11:09.430
opening in the canopy.

01:11:09.430 --> 01:11:10.950
TALIESIN: All right.

01:11:10.950 --> 01:11:12.220
LAURA: Holy moly.

01:11:12.220 --> 01:11:13.140
TALIESIN: All right.

01:11:13.140 --> 01:11:17.030
MARISHA: Maybe something has trees on its back and
moves.

01:11:17.030 --> 01:11:23.250
LAURA: Wow, maybe the hag can just move her hut
magically whenever she wants.

01:11:23.250 --> 01:11:26.530
Do you think that's possible?

01:11:26.530 --> 01:11:28.570
MARISHA: I don't know, maybe.

01:11:28.570 --> 01:11:31.070
LAURA: But the big scary tree, that's staying
still.

01:11:31.070 --> 01:11:31.680
MATT: Yeah.

01:11:31.680 --> 01:11:33.130
MARISHA: Was it coming from that direction?

01:11:33.130 --> 01:11:34.380
MATT: Yeah, it's still in its place.

01:11:34.380 --> 01:11:35.850
LAURA: What direction was it coming from?

01:11:35.850 --> 01:11:38.060
MATT: Actually, it would be kind of southwest from
where you are now.

01:11:38.060 --> 01:11:40.050
MARISHA: So the direction we came from.

01:11:40.050 --> 01:11:44.780
MATT: No, you came southeast, not the direction
where you came from, it's still maybe a

01:11:44.780 --> 01:11:51.000
quarter-mile to a half-mile from where you
currently are, so it's not on your path per se.

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:52.620
TRAVIS: Can I roll some hit dice to heal up?

01:11:52.620 --> 01:11:53.540
LAURA: All right. Shit.

01:11:53.540 --> 01:11:55.270
MATT: Well, for a full night's rest you're fully
healed.

01:11:55.270 --> 01:11:57.890
LAURA: I guess I shut the door. That's creepy.

01:11:57.890 --> 01:11:59.950
MATT: All right. You close the door.

01:11:59.950 --> 01:12:03.540
LAURA: I don't know who I would talk to about
that. Can I go find Keyleth, are you asleep yet?

01:12:03.540 --> 01:12:06.510
MARISHA: No. I don't think so. I've been helping
Percy with his shoes.

01:12:06.510 --> 01:12:08.630
TALIESIN: Yeah, we're in my room. Making shoes.

01:12:08.630 --> 01:12:10.400
MATT: Okay. Shoes are finished now.

01:12:10.400 --> 01:12:11.960
LAURA: Oh. Okay. So you guys are together?

01:12:11.960 --> 01:12:13.620
MARISHA: Just finished making shoes.

01:12:13.620 --> 01:12:15.510
LAURA: Oh, look at those beautiful shoes.
They're lovely.

01:12:15.510 --> 01:12:17.080
MARISHA: Yeah, they might work.

01:12:17.080 --> 01:12:18.440
TALIESIN: They're not, but thank you.

01:12:18.440 --> 01:12:20.370
MATT: They're pretty rough. They're pretty rough.

01:12:20.370 --> 01:12:21.470
LAURA: No, no, those look great.

01:12:21.470 --> 01:12:22.270
MARISHA: Thank you.

01:12:22.270 --> 01:12:23.660
TALIESIN: Rustic. Very rustic.

01:12:23.660 --> 01:12:25.380
MARISHA: Thank you. I'm proud of them, Percy.

01:12:25.380 --> 01:12:26.390
TALIESIN: I'm proud too.

01:12:26.390 --> 01:12:28.460
TRAVIS: Your shoes suck.

01:12:28.460 --> 01:12:31.050
TALIESIN: You're not here.

01:12:31.050 --> 01:12:34.600
MATT: He did pop in briefly to just tell you
that.

01:12:34.600 --> 01:12:36.300
LAURA: (Grog voice) Those shoes suck.

01:12:36.300 --> 01:12:38.460
MATT: And closes the door.

01:12:38.460 --> 01:12:41.620
SAM: He did that to everybody's room, just in
case.

01:12:41.620 --> 01:12:44.660
MATT: To cover all his bases.

01:12:44.660 --> 01:12:46.160
SAM: Hey!

01:12:46.160 --> 01:12:47.470
MATT: Perfect.

01:12:47.470 --> 01:12:48.790
LAURA: Can I sit down?

01:12:48.790 --> 01:12:51.220
MARISHA: You were supposed to be a bootmaker.
You're super-judgey.

01:12:51.220 --> 01:12:52.380
LAURA: Oh, this is true.

01:12:52.380 --> 01:12:53.470
TALIESIN: You were a bootmaker, that's very true.

01:12:53.470 --> 01:12:54.370
MATT: You did start making your own boots, yeah.

01:12:54.370 --> 01:12:55.400
LAURA: That was your very first--

01:12:55.400 --> 01:12:57.700
TRAVIS: You didn't ask me to make the boots.

01:12:57.700 --> 01:13:02.280
LAURA: Can I sit down and start playing with the
shoes? And, um, ask, Keyleth? Do you know of

01:13:02.280 --> 01:13:06.000
anything that would cause entire trees to vanish?

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:07.730
MARISHA: How do you mean, vanish?

01:13:07.730 --> 01:13:12.300
LAURA: Well, I was staring at the door, and all of
a sudden, around a space,

01:13:12.300 --> 01:13:15.080
about three trees just disappeared.

01:13:15.080 --> 01:13:18.200
MARISHA: Like something really large passed in
front of it?

01:13:18.200 --> 01:13:21.000
LAURA: No, like they dropped, and there's a hole
in the canopy.

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:22.000
TALIESIN: Huh.

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:23.320
MARISHA: That's different.

01:13:23.320 --> 01:13:24.130
TALIESIN: That's interesting.

01:13:24.130 --> 01:13:25.700
LAURA: Do you know of anything that would cause
that?

01:13:25.700 --> 01:13:26.670
TRAVIS: In the Feywild?

01:13:26.670 --> 01:13:28.780
MARISHA: Do I know of anything that would cause
that? Can I roll a nature check or something?

01:13:28.780 --> 01:13:31.260
MATT: Roll a nature check.

01:13:31.260 --> 01:13:32.560
MARISHA: Don't fucking fail me.

01:13:32.560 --> 01:13:34.580
LAURA: Would we have learned anything about that
in our studies?

01:13:34.580 --> 01:13:36.050
MARISHA: (yells wordlessly)

01:13:36.050 --> 01:13:37.720
SAM: Wow, those dice.

01:13:37.720 --> 01:13:39.450
LAURA: Maybe just don't use them anymore.

01:13:39.450 --> 01:13:40.870
TRAVIS: Don't know who you pissed off...

01:13:40.870 --> 01:13:41.690
MARISHA: 14.

01:13:41.690 --> 01:13:42.520
MATT: 14.

01:13:42.520 --> 01:13:44.360
LAURA: They're so nice and-- maybe just put them
on display!

01:13:44.360 --> 01:13:46.840
Maybe put them in a really pretty
glass case.

01:13:46.840 --> 01:13:52.140
MATT: No. Make 'em work for you. Make 'em work for
you. You paid for that shit.

01:13:52.140 --> 01:13:53.980
LAURA: Turn 'em into jewelry?

01:13:53.980 --> 01:14:00.860
MATT: I mean, there are a number of things that
could've done it, whether it be lumbering,

01:14:00.860 --> 01:14:05.350
people chopping down trees takes them down.
Creatures that are large can push over trees.

01:14:05.350 --> 01:14:09.460
Trees that are dying and rotting and eventually
fall over on their own.

01:14:09.460 --> 01:14:12.690
LAURA: Did it look like they dropped down,
though? Or did it look like they dropped over?

01:14:12.690 --> 01:14:15.900
MATT: It's hard to know from this perspective.
You just saw them kind of fall out of the canopy,

01:14:15.900 --> 01:14:20.200
so you're not sure if it was at an angle or
straight down or what.

01:14:20.200 --> 01:14:22.270
MARISHA: That could be so many things.

01:14:22.270 --> 01:14:22.810
LAURA: Yeah.

01:14:22.810 --> 01:14:25.610
MARISHA: It's hard to say.

01:14:25.610 --> 01:14:30.320
TALIESIN: At this point, can I tell anything about
the muck from just boiling it to separate

01:14:30.320 --> 01:14:35.280
components? Trying to just see what's in there.
I'm assuming it's probably just death-paste,

01:14:35.280 --> 01:14:37.980
it's just rot.

01:14:37.980 --> 01:14:46.840
MATT: It looks to be just congealed decayed
matter. It does not have any properties that you

01:14:46.840 --> 01:14:52.300
can tell on a chemical level at least that stand
out.

01:14:52.300 --> 01:14:53.860
TALIESIN: But it is decayed matter.

01:14:53.860 --> 01:14:57.570
MATT: It is various types of decayed matter,
organic matter.

01:14:57.570 --> 01:15:00.060
TALIESIN: The tree is producing it.

01:15:00.060 --> 01:15:01.850
LAURA: So it is like oil.

01:15:01.850 --> 01:15:03.490
TALIESIN: Well, here's my question.

01:15:03.490 --> 01:15:06.970
MARISHA: It's producing a lot of it, too.
Way more than it should.

01:15:06.970 --> 01:15:08.860
TALIESIN: What do trees need to live?

01:15:08.860 --> 01:15:09.810
TRAVIS: Grass.

01:15:09.810 --> 01:15:11.050
SAM: Sunlight and water.

01:15:11.050 --> 01:15:12.430
LAURA: Sunlight and water.

01:15:12.430 --> 01:15:14.400
MARISHA: And a little bit of minerals and dirt.

01:15:14.400 --> 01:15:17.590
TALIESIN: Where is the sunlight?

01:15:17.590 --> 01:15:19.620
LAURA: Not here.

01:15:19.620 --> 01:15:21.730
TALIESIN: And the tree's alive.

01:15:21.730 --> 01:15:24.370
MARISHA: Well, we're also in the Feywild.

01:15:24.370 --> 01:15:26.460
LAURA: Might not need the same thing.

01:15:26.460 --> 01:15:27.880
MARISHA: Might not need the same thing.

01:15:27.880 --> 01:15:30.320
TALIESIN: Well, it's got to eat something.
This is what it's producing,

01:15:30.320 --> 01:15:31.860
and it's got to eat something.

01:15:31.860 --> 01:15:33.620
LAURA: Maybe it eats living creatures?

01:15:33.620 --> 01:15:35.030
TALIESIN: Maybe it eats trees.

01:15:35.030 --> 01:15:38.480
LIAM: So Percival, would you imagine that the
science of the Feywild, I don't know what that

01:15:38.480 --> 01:15:46.170
phrase means, would it be the same as our own
world? Maybe it follows different rules.

01:15:46.170 --> 01:15:53.010
TALIESIN: It probably does, but at the same time,
you don't get something from nothing. And...

01:15:53.010 --> 01:15:56.100
life needs things to live.

01:15:56.100 --> 01:15:57.990
SAM: That's so poetic.

01:15:57.990 --> 01:16:02.110
TALIESIN: You don't get life from nothing.
A little iffy.

01:16:02.110 --> 01:16:06.430
LAURA: And we did see those branches moving like
actual limbs on a being

01:16:06.430 --> 01:16:09.090
as opposed to branches on a tree.

01:16:09.090 --> 01:16:12.430
MARISHA: Well, I mean, nothing here has really
been natural.

01:16:12.430 --> 01:16:14.100
LAURA: It could be like a venus flytrap.

01:16:14.100 --> 01:16:20.880
TALIESIN: It's just a hypothesis, but what if the
tree's carnivorous. Or omnivorous.

01:16:20.880 --> 01:16:24.000
LAURA: I think that's a very viable option.

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:29.100
MARISHA: So you think maybe it's the tree that ate
that other group of trees?

01:16:29.100 --> 01:16:29.950
LAURA: Possibly.

01:16:29.950 --> 01:16:31.460
TALIESIN: It's very big.

01:16:31.460 --> 01:16:32.740
MARISHA: It's a cannibal tree?

01:16:32.740 --> 01:16:34.140
TALIESIN: It might be a cannibal tree.

01:16:34.140 --> 01:16:35.450
MARISHA: It's eating its own kind?

01:16:35.450 --> 01:16:39.950
TRAVIS: I mean, the sphinx did say that the bow is
the heart of a cancerous tree, I think if we're

01:16:39.950 --> 01:16:43.070
expecting to not find the tree, we're stupid.

01:16:43.070 --> 01:16:46.200
MARISHA: Does Fenthras mean anything? Fenthras
doesn't mean anything, right?

01:16:46.200 --> 01:16:47.910
TRAVIS: I am the wrong one to ask.

01:16:47.910 --> 01:16:49.620
LAURA: Fenthras, is that elven?

01:16:49.620 --> 01:16:51.210
MATT: Fenthras is elven.

01:16:51.210 --> 01:16:52.410
MARISHA: Is that a name?

01:16:52.410 --> 01:16:57.820
MATT: There is no direct translation to it,
per se, but its name has hints or at least bases

01:16:57.820 --> 01:17:06.280
of the ancient elven words for protector and
growth.

01:17:06.280 --> 01:17:09.130
TALIESIN: Interesting.

01:17:09.130 --> 01:17:10.610
MARISHA: Protector and growth.

01:17:10.610 --> 01:17:12.700
TRAVIS: Why don't we poison the tree?

01:17:12.700 --> 01:17:13.830
LAURA: I think it's already poisoned.

01:17:13.830 --> 01:17:15.450
TALIESIN: How do you poison a poisoned tree?

01:17:15.450 --> 01:17:16.590
LAURA: Give it sunlight.

01:17:16.590 --> 01:17:20.330
TALIESIN: Sunlight is definitely something you
should put in your arsenal.

01:17:20.330 --> 01:17:23.130
Whatever it's not used to being exposed to.

01:17:23.130 --> 01:17:25.970
LAURA: Sunlight and water. Fresh water.

01:17:25.970 --> 01:17:28.090
TALIESIN: I don't think rot is going to be how we
kill this thing.

01:17:28.090 --> 01:17:30.620
I think it's not going to be like
the crocodile.

01:17:30.620 --> 01:17:31.950
TRAVIS: Abba music.

01:17:31.950 --> 01:17:33.020
LAURA: (laughs) Abba music.

01:17:33.020 --> 01:17:33.960
MARISHA: No, it seems--

01:17:33.960 --> 01:17:35.990
TALIESIN: It needs purification.

01:17:35.990 --> 01:17:38.140
SAM: Don't worry, Pike can... oh.

01:17:38.140 --> 01:17:39.950
TRAVIS: I also have poison.

01:17:39.950 --> 01:17:40.930
SAM: Oh, okay.

01:17:40.930 --> 01:17:43.070
TALIESIN: I think it might just laugh poison off.

01:17:43.070 --> 01:17:44.590
TRAVIS: Oh.

01:17:44.590 --> 01:17:45.960
TALIESIN: I don't know.

01:17:45.960 --> 01:17:47.460
TRAVIS: What about honey?

01:17:47.460 --> 01:17:48.860
TALIESIN: Nothing laughs honey off.

01:17:48.860 --> 01:17:50.580
LAURA: You have honey? Can you make honey in
your--

01:17:50.580 --> 01:17:51.780
TALIESIN: Can you make honey in that jar?

01:17:51.780 --> 01:17:54.100
LIAM: Pull out the magic jug, yeah.

01:17:54.100 --> 01:17:55.930
LAURA: You can make fresh water in that jug,
though, can't you?

01:17:55.930 --> 01:17:57.350
TRAVIS: I got honey for you.

01:17:57.350 --> 01:17:59.020
TALIESIN: You've got very little brain, don't
you?

01:17:59.020 --> 01:18:00.070
MARISHA: Make some maple syrup?

01:18:00.070 --> 01:18:01.460
SAM: How about holy water?

01:18:01.460 --> 01:18:02.380
TRAVIS: No.

01:18:02.380 --> 01:18:03.770
LAURA: Maybe? I don't know.

01:18:03.770 --> 01:18:05.920
TRAVIS: I mean, I can make some water if you wanna
bless it.

01:18:05.920 --> 01:18:06.680
SAM: No.

01:18:06.680 --> 01:18:08.670
TALIESIN: That's not what we're hoping for.

01:18:08.670 --> 01:18:12.470
MARISHA: I mean, when I was in my earth elemental
form, I got up underneath the tree, I mean,

01:18:12.470 --> 01:18:17.530
I feel like if we needed to, I can get inside of
it.

01:18:17.530 --> 01:18:19.240
TRAVIS: (laughs) By yourself?

01:18:19.240 --> 01:18:22.580
LAURA: I think that could be a very scary
prospect.

01:18:22.580 --> 01:18:27.560
TRAVIS: Let me tell you a tale of two people that
went inside a dragon.

01:18:27.560 --> 01:18:29.160
LIAM: Worked out.

01:18:29.160 --> 01:18:31.200
MARISHA: Yeah, they're still sitting here today.
It's fine.

01:18:31.200 --> 01:18:34.520
TALIESIN: I was about to say, I don't think it's
much of a cautionary tale, really.

01:18:34.520 --> 01:18:38.640
MARISHA: No. If anything, it's a terrible,
terrible influence.

01:18:38.640 --> 01:18:45.990
TALIESIN: Yes. I think that's definitely,
I think light, I think electricity.

01:18:45.990 --> 01:18:49.530
MARISHA: Well, it's not short on water, that's for
sure.

01:18:49.530 --> 01:18:53.850
TALIESIN: There is water in the, was there
groundwater of some kind?

01:18:53.850 --> 01:18:58.070
MARISHA: I mean, it was sludgy enough. Was there
groundwater?

01:18:58.070 --> 01:19:02.420
MATT: I mean, there were pockets or some bit of
groundwater in there, but a lot of the dense

01:19:02.420 --> 01:19:08.070
pockets you found were just deeply seated pockets
of that sludge-like material that seems to be

01:19:08.070 --> 01:19:10.550
produced or put out by the nearby roots.

01:19:10.550 --> 01:19:11.600
MARISHA: Right.

01:19:11.600 --> 01:19:15.130
LAURA: When you talked to the trees around you,
did it seem like they were actually alive,

01:19:15.130 --> 01:19:18.060
or was it all dead forest that we've been
traveling through?

01:19:18.060 --> 01:19:19.500
MARISHA: When I communed with nature?

01:19:19.500 --> 01:19:20.000
LAURA: Yeah.

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:24.160
MARISHA: Everything was alive everywhere.
That's what, the rules here haven't really--

01:19:24.160 --> 01:19:28.840
SAM: Have you been talking to any of the trees
around here? Right around here?

01:19:28.840 --> 01:19:31.330
MARISHA: Yeah, I can. I can.

01:19:31.330 --> 01:19:33.940
LAURA: Maybe before we sleep. Can you talk to the
nature?

01:19:33.940 --> 01:19:36.550
MARISHA: I can.

01:19:36.550 --> 01:19:38.230
TALIESIN: I'll watch this.

01:19:38.230 --> 01:19:43.410
MARISHA: Do we have any questions that I might
want to figure out before I--

01:19:43.410 --> 01:19:45.670
SAM: Is the big tree eating you all?

01:19:45.670 --> 01:19:49.040
LAURA: Are you friends with the big tree? How can
we help?

01:19:49.040 --> 01:19:50.540
TALIESIN: Can we cure you?

01:19:50.540 --> 01:19:54.970
MARISHA: Cure the tree, is the tree eating other
things, can we cure the tree...

01:19:54.970 --> 01:19:56.800
SAM: Is that a tree?

01:19:56.800 --> 01:19:58.380
MARISHA: Is that even a tree?

01:19:58.380 --> 01:20:00.190
LAURA: Oh, what if it's a big scary creature,
not actually a tree?

01:20:00.190 --> 01:20:01.630
TRAVIS: Can we hurt the tree?

01:20:01.630 --> 01:20:03.040
LIAM: Does the tree have a weakness?

01:20:03.040 --> 01:20:04.550
LAURA: Yeah.

01:20:04.550 --> 01:20:08.310
MARISHA: I'll maybe try and figure out...
okay, all right. I'm gonna go step outside.

01:20:08.310 --> 01:20:11.730
LAURA: Do you want to hang out on the broom so you
don't actually step--

01:20:11.730 --> 01:20:13.210
TRAVIS: You're just giving the broom away now.

01:20:13.210 --> 01:20:15.500
LAURA: Well, I just don't want anybody to actually
stand on a tree for very long.

01:20:15.500 --> 01:20:17.030
TRAVIS: Just saying.

01:20:17.030 --> 01:20:20.430
MARISHA: I have to be connected with the ground,
I think.

01:20:20.430 --> 01:20:22.550
TALIESIN: Tie a rope around her this time.

01:20:22.550 --> 01:20:23.700
LAURA: Right.

01:20:23.700 --> 01:20:29.930
MARISHA: Okay, yeah, tie a rope around me.
And I jump back in the mud.

01:20:29.930 --> 01:20:35.270
MATT: You land (splash), close to knee-deep in the
actual muck below you.

01:20:35.270 --> 01:20:37.230
MARISHA: I'm gonna kind of lay back into it.

01:20:37.230 --> 01:20:39.090
LAURA: Oh, jeez!

01:20:39.090 --> 01:20:40.840
SAM: Ooh, like American Beauty?

01:20:40.840 --> 01:20:42.630
MARISHA: Sensory deprivation tank-style.

01:20:42.630 --> 01:20:44.700
LAURA: I just send things down onto her.

01:20:44.700 --> 01:20:45.800
SAM: Chicken?

01:20:45.800 --> 01:20:48.100
MATT: As you lay there, you slowly sink into it,
until you guys just see the outside of Keyleth's

01:20:48.100 --> 01:20:52.550
face emerge, some of her horned crown sticking out
of the muck. A little bit of her chest and her

01:20:52.550 --> 01:20:56.450
knees and some of the hands emerging, the rest of
her is submerged entirely in this muck.

01:20:56.450 --> 01:20:57.850
TRAVIS: Sweet.

01:20:57.850 --> 01:21:02.230
MATT: You close your eyes and begin reciting the
incantation of the spell. You begin to worry as

01:21:02.230 --> 01:21:07.400
she begins to sink further in, but as she finishes
the incantation she stops sinking and it brings

01:21:07.400 --> 01:21:12.000
her to the surface halfway and keeps her at this
balance point there.

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.470
LAURA: We're just staring out the door down at
her.

01:21:14.470 --> 01:21:15.980
TALIESIN: Holding a rope.

01:21:15.980 --> 01:21:19.950
MATT: Suddenly your consciousness kind of extends
into all the nearby, and it's rush because there's

01:21:19.950 --> 01:21:26.770
just life all around you, life itself is dark,
it's twisted, but it is living. What do you wish

01:21:26.770 --> 01:21:30.780
to ask of the nearby essence?

01:21:30.780 --> 01:21:43.140
MARISHA: Um, okay. Can I figure out what is
feeding the tree, what the tree, if the tree is

01:21:43.140 --> 01:21:49.810
consuming things around it, what is fueling the
tree?

01:21:49.810 --> 01:21:52.200
MATT: The response?

01:21:52.200 --> 01:21:55.390
MARISHA: I sense a lot coming out from the tree,
that's clear,

01:21:55.390 --> 01:21:57.960
can I sense an energy going in
towards the tree?

01:21:57.960 --> 01:22:01.610
MATT: Well, your question is, what is feeding the
tree? You have to ask a question.

01:22:01.610 --> 01:22:05.260
MARISHA: What is fueling the tree, yes.

01:22:05.260 --> 01:22:06.790
MATT: Sondur.

01:22:06.790 --> 01:22:08.600
SAM: Sondur?

01:22:08.600 --> 01:22:10.440
LAURA: We aren't listening to this.

01:22:10.440 --> 01:22:14.370
MARISHA: Sondur.

01:22:14.370 --> 01:22:20.750
TRAVIS: I love having a character who can't read.
No pressure.

01:22:20.750 --> 01:22:25.970
MATT: Sondur is the only response you get.

01:22:25.970 --> 01:22:32.320
MARISHA: What is the tree's weakness?

01:22:32.320 --> 01:22:33.740
SAM: Poovah.

01:22:33.740 --> 01:22:37.840
(All laugh.)

01:22:37.840 --> 01:22:42.400
SAM: Shamalaka.

01:22:42.400 --> 01:22:44.080
TALIESIN: Terry.

01:22:44.080 --> 01:22:45.570
LAURA: (laughs) Terry.

01:22:45.570 --> 01:22:50.320
MATT: You get no response, it seems like the
question doesn't take hold in the connection,

01:22:50.320 --> 01:22:56.440
there is no answer to that question. It doesn't
consume

01:22:56.440 --> 01:22:58.410
the question asked as part of the incantation.

01:22:58.410 --> 01:23:01.510
LAURA: Remember, we asked if it was an actual
tree, if it's an actual tree.

01:23:01.510 --> 01:23:07.940
SAM: Has it been eating you?

01:23:07.940 --> 01:23:12.060
LAURA: (whispers) Who is Sondur?

01:23:12.060 --> 01:23:18.020
MARISHA: Who is Sondur? That's actually,
I should've thought about that,

01:23:18.020 --> 01:23:20.610
that's a good one.

01:23:20.610 --> 01:23:26.410
MATT: It has to relate to the area, terrain,
bodies of water, actual information about

01:23:26.410 --> 01:23:31.750
individuals? The living essence of the forest
would not probably know that.

01:23:31.750 --> 01:23:45.770
MARISHA: Okay. Then can I ask the living fauna
around me if this tree is sucking life force from

01:23:45.770 --> 01:23:51.730
them? Is the tree in the middle hurting the plants
all around, like for example--

01:23:51.730 --> 01:23:57.720
MATT: The answer is yes.

01:23:57.720 --> 01:23:59.360
MARISHA: Is that all I got?

01:23:59.360 --> 01:24:01.230
MATT: That's your two questions. You asked one
that wasn't effectual,

01:24:01.230 --> 01:24:06.510
and thus the incantation
did not consider it utilized.

01:24:06.510 --> 01:24:08.390
SAM: Is it a tree?

01:24:08.390 --> 01:24:12.040
MATT: One more question.

01:24:12.040 --> 01:24:17.840
MARISHA: Is the cancerous tree more than just a
tree?

01:24:17.840 --> 01:24:19.620
SAM: Good question.

01:24:19.620 --> 01:24:21.280
MATT: Yes.

01:24:21.280 --> 01:24:22.420
SAM: Yes.

01:24:22.420 --> 01:24:24.700
MARISHA: Sure, that probably... sure.

01:24:24.700 --> 01:24:26.160
TALIESIN: We got a name.

01:24:26.160 --> 01:24:29.830
MATT: And with that, suddenly, you feel the
incantation break its hold with the nearby life

01:24:29.830 --> 01:24:32.460
sources, you begin to sink once again.

01:24:32.460 --> 01:24:33.930
LAURA: (gasps) Pull her out, pull her out.

01:24:33.930 --> 01:24:38.010
MATT: As you guys pull up as you reach up and grab
it, pulling her free from the swampy morass,

01:24:38.010 --> 01:24:41.800
and carry her back up to the entrance of the
mansion.

01:24:41.800 --> 01:24:43.780
SAM: What did he say?

01:24:43.780 --> 01:24:45.040
MARISHA: Sondur.

01:24:45.040 --> 01:24:46.030
SAM: Sondur.

01:24:46.030 --> 01:24:47.250
LAURA: What do you mean, Sondur?

01:24:47.250 --> 01:24:48.480
MARISHA: Sondur, that's...

01:24:48.480 --> 01:24:50.380
LAURA: Is that a band, what is it?

01:24:50.380 --> 01:24:51.530
SAM: Flight of the Sondurs?

01:24:51.530 --> 01:24:53.740
MARISHA: (laughs) Flight of the Sondurs.

01:24:53.740 --> 01:24:55.400
TRAVIS: Is that like an elven word?

01:24:55.400 --> 01:24:56.780
LAURA: Is it an elven word?

01:24:56.780 --> 01:24:57.840
MARISHA: Is it an elven word?

01:24:57.840 --> 01:24:58.800
LAURA: That we've heard?

01:24:58.800 --> 01:25:00.130
SAM: Do any of us recognize the word?

01:25:00.130 --> 01:25:05.120
MATT: None of you recognize the word, but it does
sound like a name with elvish background or

01:25:05.120 --> 01:25:11.450
heritage, or at least some sort of ancient elvish
roots to the name structure. It doesn't have

01:25:11.450 --> 01:25:16.180
specific meaning, but there are names you've heard
of people of

01:25:16.180 --> 01:25:22.140
elven lineage that are plays on a similar sound.

01:25:22.140 --> 01:25:25.920
LAURA: Does it sound... I mean, what would those
names mean?

01:25:25.920 --> 01:25:29.210
MATT: Well, I mean, the one that's closest to you
is your father's, which is Syldor.

01:25:29.210 --> 01:25:31.890
LAURA: Right, and he's a dick, so the tree
probably is too.

01:25:31.890 --> 01:25:34.930
SAM: Sondur, Syldor, they're brothers.

01:25:34.930 --> 01:25:36.930
MATT: Totally.

01:25:36.930 --> 01:25:38.310
SAM: Isn't that how it works?

01:25:38.310 --> 01:25:40.100
LAURA: That is how it works. Vex and Vax.

01:25:40.100 --> 01:25:43.720
MARISHA: Percy.

01:25:43.720 --> 01:25:44.470
TALIESIN: Yes?

01:25:44.470 --> 01:25:48.320
MARISHA: You've done a lot of reading of the elven
culture. Do you know anything about a Sondur?

01:25:48.320 --> 01:25:50.790
MATT: You have no idea.

01:25:50.790 --> 01:25:56.140
TALIESIN: I have no idea. I'm racking my brain and
wishing I had access to a library.

01:25:56.140 --> 01:25:57.670
LAURA: Do you have a library here?

01:25:57.670 --> 01:26:01.870
SAM: Do I?

01:26:01.870 --> 01:26:06.700
MATT: Well, you can have one apparate within the
mansion, if you wish.

01:26:06.700 --> 01:26:08.230
SAM: With books?

01:26:08.230 --> 01:26:09.880
MATT: Yeah.

01:26:09.880 --> 01:26:16.170
SAM: Of course I have a library! It's in my
personal chambers where I do all of my studying.

01:26:16.170 --> 01:26:17.480
TRAVIS: Keyleth.

01:26:17.480 --> 01:26:19.480
LAURA: Oh. We have to go to your actual bedroom?

01:26:19.480 --> 01:26:21.030
TALIESIN: It's all pornography. Just the entire
library is like--

01:26:21.030 --> 01:26:22.210
SAM: Only in the back.

01:26:22.210 --> 01:26:23.670
TALIESIN: It's like Beauty and the Beast,
it's just pornography.

01:26:23.670 --> 01:26:24.620
MARISHA: Yes, Grog?

01:26:24.620 --> 01:26:28.180
TRAVIS: Did you ask if the tree was just one
thing?

01:26:28.180 --> 01:26:31.300
MARISHA: It didn't appear to be one thing.

01:26:31.300 --> 01:26:40.870
Because it was harming the plant life
around it. So it's not necessarily all connected,

01:26:40.870 --> 01:26:47.680
it seems. But it is also definitely not just a
tree.

01:26:47.680 --> 01:26:54.470
TRAVIS: What if we, like, salt the earth? That's
an expression.

01:26:54.470 --> 01:26:58.400
TALIESIN: It's more than an expression, it's
legitimately something you do. Unfortunately,

01:26:58.400 --> 01:27:00.210
you need salt for that.

01:27:00.210 --> 01:27:03.800
LAURA: Do we have salt? Do we have lots of salt
here in the mansion, Scanlan?

01:27:03.800 --> 01:27:05.670
SAM: It's all over the floor of the kitchen.

01:27:05.670 --> 01:27:08.390
LAURA: Oh, but we can't bring it out, we can't
bring it out.

01:27:08.390 --> 01:27:10.200
TRAVIS: I have 12 gallons of salt water.

01:27:10.200 --> 01:27:12.150
MARISHA: Didn't you get a bunch of salt when you
jumped into the--

01:27:12.150 --> 01:27:14.370
LAURA: I don't know if 12 gallons is enough to
kill a tree.

01:27:14.370 --> 01:27:16.070
MARISHA: --when you did the cannonball contest?

01:27:16.070 --> 01:27:17.160
TALIESIN: That wasn't salt.

01:27:17.160 --> 01:27:20.560
TRAVIS: I've heard them say it before, they're
like, oh, you are the salt of the earth.

01:27:20.560 --> 01:27:25.800
TALIESIN: That wasn't salt, that was something
else, and I used it all for the cannonball.

01:27:25.800 --> 01:27:30.440
SAM: So what's our plan? Do we attack this thing
with brute force? How do we corrupt the ground?

01:27:30.440 --> 01:27:34.430
You can turn the ground to stone, will that help
anything? Right?

01:27:34.430 --> 01:27:38.330
TRAVIS: What's on the other side of this tree?
It's huge, it's a hundred feet.

01:27:38.330 --> 01:27:43.140
TALIESIN: Inside the tree is the bow. I think if
we remove the bow, I think if we find the bow

01:27:43.140 --> 01:27:46.730
inside the tree, I think that's how--

01:27:46.730 --> 01:27:49.800
SAM: That's a lot of tree to search, it could be
way up, it could be in a branch.

01:27:49.800 --> 01:27:52.250
LIAM: What is the legend, at the heart of this
tree?

01:27:52.250 --> 01:27:55.120
TALIESIN: The heart of this tree. I think we go
in.

01:27:55.120 --> 01:27:58.110
TRAVIS: It used to be a titan that had its heart
broken or something.

01:27:58.110 --> 01:27:59.370
LIAM: Probably inside.

01:27:59.370 --> 01:28:01.020
LAURA: Yeah, what if the--

01:28:01.020 --> 01:28:08.770
SAM: It says it now acts as the heart to a
cancerous tree corrupting the verdant land.

01:28:08.770 --> 01:28:11.500
TALIESIN: If I were the heart of a tree,
I'd be in the center.

01:28:11.500 --> 01:28:16.650
MARISHA: It was a bow that felled the titans.

01:28:16.650 --> 01:28:21.030
LAURA: I feel like we probably should've done some
research on Fenthras before we came out here.

01:28:21.030 --> 01:28:23.320
SAM: We can go to my library.

01:28:23.320 --> 01:28:25.060
LAURA: Look in your library, I am following you to
your library.

01:28:25.060 --> 01:28:26.760
TALIESIN: I'm curious to see the library,
I just want to see

01:28:26.760 --> 01:28:28.240
what a giant disaster this is.

01:28:28.240 --> 01:28:31.040
MATT: You did receive a little information about
it from Allura, from her research as well.

01:28:31.040 --> 01:28:32.500
LAURA: Yes, that's right, that's right!

01:28:32.500 --> 01:28:34.660
MATT: Did you write that down?

01:28:34.660 --> 01:28:36.260
SAM: Maybe?

01:28:36.260 --> 01:28:39.410
LAURA: Yeah, but I listened to her real hard when
she was talking.

01:28:39.410 --> 01:28:41.360
SAM: Marisha writes down everything.

01:28:41.360 --> 01:28:43.240
MARISHA: I do, it's just... where.

01:28:43.240 --> 01:28:44.710
SAM: The bigger question is how does she find it.

01:28:44.710 --> 01:28:48.360
MARISHA: How do I find it, exactly. When did we
talk to her?

01:28:48.360 --> 01:28:51.810
MATT: Last time you were in Whitestone, right
before you left for the actual Feywild.

01:28:51.810 --> 01:28:55.370
LAURA: Aw man, I don't think I wrote it down,
I think I was just listening.

01:28:55.370 --> 01:28:58.140
MARISHA: All right, Feywild, hang on.

01:28:58.140 --> 01:29:01.350
SAM: I know that Simon's mom is Elwen.

01:29:01.350 --> 01:29:04.810
MATT: There you go. See? Perfect. That was
pre-stream.

01:29:04.810 --> 01:29:10.140
SAM: I know that...

01:29:10.140 --> 01:29:12.320
LAURA: Fenthras! No, that's all I wrote.

01:29:12.320 --> 01:29:14.520
MATT: (laughs) You were so excited for a second.
So excited.

01:29:14.520 --> 01:29:16.700
LAURA: I was so excited 'cause I saw it written
down, but no, I didn't write.

01:29:16.700 --> 01:29:18.220
MATT: No.

01:29:18.220 --> 01:29:19.380
LAURA: I'm sorry.

01:29:19.380 --> 01:29:20.930
TRAVIS: You're gonna make me check my notes?

01:29:20.930 --> 01:29:25.130
LAURA: I didn't write it down. Dammit. Balls.
But I have a real good--

01:29:25.130 --> 01:29:28.500
SAM: I know that there's a hatmaker named Deirdre
somewhere in the world.

01:29:28.500 --> 01:29:30.530
MATT: Guys. You guys.

01:29:30.530 --> 01:29:34.580
LIAM: Would a really successful history check help
Vex remember what the fuck she was told?

01:29:34.580 --> 01:29:39.330
MATT: (laughs) Go ahead and make a history check.

01:29:39.330 --> 01:29:41.220
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay.

01:29:41.220 --> 01:29:43.850
TRAVIS: I've got vegemite written down.

01:29:43.850 --> 01:29:45.930
TALIESIN: I think that's a shopping list.

01:29:45.930 --> 01:29:49.140
MARISHA: God, I was clearly writing incredibly
fast.

01:29:49.140 --> 01:29:51.010
LAURA: Shit history.

01:29:51.010 --> 01:29:52.090
TALIESIN: Yeah.

01:29:52.090 --> 01:29:53.170
SAM: Did you roll it?

01:29:53.170 --> 01:29:54.340
LAURA: 17 is what I rolled.

01:29:54.340 --> 01:29:55.310
SAM: Well, that's something.

01:29:55.310 --> 01:29:56.700
MATT: 17 is not too bad.

01:29:56.700 --> 01:29:58.090
MARISHA: I have 'archfey, black heart'.

01:29:58.090 --> 01:29:59.470
MATT: Yes.

01:29:59.470 --> 01:30:02.400
LAURA: Okay, that jogged my memory a little bit,
I sort of remember.

01:30:02.400 --> 01:30:03.620
MATT: There you go.

01:30:03.620 --> 01:30:05.310
MARISHA: He was an arch-- yes, go ahead.

01:30:05.310 --> 01:30:13.690
MATT: There was an archfey that existed here that
was apparently the holder of Fenthras that was

01:30:13.690 --> 01:30:19.680
betrayed and his heart became corrupted and thus
became the center of this corruption.

01:30:19.680 --> 01:30:23.930
SAM: There you go.

01:30:23.930 --> 01:30:26.800
MARISHA: So we can assume that the archfey is
probably Sondur.

01:30:26.800 --> 01:30:28.180
LAURA: Sondur.

01:30:28.180 --> 01:30:33.540
MARISHA: And he's probably still inside the tree,
and he probably is not gonna let go of his bow.

01:30:33.540 --> 01:30:36.530
LAURA: What exactly is an archfey?

01:30:36.530 --> 01:30:43.540
MATT: An archfey, from your knowledge and
experience, they're very powerful fey creatures,

01:30:43.540 --> 01:30:47.680
some largely belonged to some of the leading
courts in the Feywild,

01:30:47.680 --> 01:30:49.440
the Seelie and the Unseelie.

01:30:49.440 --> 01:30:50.420
LIAM: Oberon.

01:30:50.420 --> 01:30:51.310
LAURA: Oh.

01:30:51.310 --> 01:30:54.800
MATT: Some unaffiliated. Like for instance,
in Midsummer Night's Dream,

01:30:54.800 --> 01:30:57.240
Titania and Oberon would totally be archfey.

01:30:57.240 --> 01:30:58.630
LAURA: Archfey. Okay.

01:30:58.630 --> 01:31:03.940
MATT: Very, very powerful and influential fey
creatures that both have understanding and powers

01:31:03.940 --> 01:31:07.650
to bend the surrounding Feywild to their will.

01:31:07.650 --> 01:31:12.650
MARISHA: And then he must have fought in what was
known as the Calamity?

01:31:12.650 --> 01:31:14.620
TRAVIS: Yes.

01:31:14.620 --> 01:31:20.940
MATT: Well, the Calamity wasn't against the
titans, the Calamity, those were the final battles

01:31:20.940 --> 01:31:25.240
of the gods physically on Exandria before the
Divergence in which they

01:31:25.240 --> 01:31:28.910
separated from all their creations for good.

01:31:28.910 --> 01:31:31.030
MARISHA: Where does 'black heart' come from?

01:31:31.030 --> 01:31:33.670
MARISHA: Why did I write that down?

01:31:33.670 --> 01:31:36.520
MATT: His heart was corrupted? I don't know why
you wrote it down.

01:31:36.520 --> 01:31:38.550
MARISHA: I wrote down 'black heart'.

01:31:38.550 --> 01:31:39.920
TALIESIN: Seemed like a thing.

01:31:39.920 --> 01:31:41.160
MARISHA: Seemed important.

01:31:41.160 --> 01:31:42.290
MATT: Sure.

01:31:42.290 --> 01:31:43.540
LAURA: Okay.

01:31:43.540 --> 01:31:45.060
MARISHA: 'Cause he was corrupted. Okay.

01:31:45.060 --> 01:31:47.400
SAM: So we're fighting an archfey inside a tree.

01:31:47.400 --> 01:31:50.530
LAURA: So we know how to fight the tree. Okay.

01:31:50.610 --> 01:31:52.520
SAM: We gotta get the archfey out of the tree.

01:31:52.520 --> 01:31:55.040
TALIESIN: We gotta get the archfey out of the
tree.

01:31:55.040 --> 01:31:56.530
MARISHA: So someone's going into the tree.

01:31:56.530 --> 01:31:58.140
LAURA: Maybe we can talk to it.

01:31:58.140 --> 01:31:59.860
SAM: What's its name again? Sorry.

01:31:59.860 --> 01:32:00.830
MATT: Sondur.

01:32:00.830 --> 01:32:01.900
SAM: Sondur.

01:32:01.900 --> 01:32:03.300
MATT: Was the name you were given.

01:32:03.300 --> 01:32:05.240
LAURA: Maybe if we call out to him, he'll talk to
us.

01:32:05.240 --> 01:32:06.730
MARISHA: Maybe.

01:32:06.730 --> 01:32:09.260
LIAM: Maybe if we put Shorthalt forward...

01:32:09.260 --> 01:32:10.930
LAURA: You're so charming.

01:32:10.930 --> 01:32:12.330
TALIESIN: You are so charming.

01:32:12.330 --> 01:32:13.340
SAM: Yeah, sure.

01:32:13.340 --> 01:32:15.470
TALIESIN: And you have so much good advice.

01:32:15.470 --> 01:32:16.640
TRAVIS: Do fey creatures live a long time?

01:32:16.640 --> 01:32:17.790
SAM: Hey, Sondur, Sondur, give us your bow.

01:32:17.790 --> 01:32:20.520
TRAVIS: What if he was betrayed by something in
the Feywild, and we found that thing,

01:32:20.520 --> 01:32:22.120
whether it was a comrade or a--

01:32:22.120 --> 01:32:26.520
LIAM: Well, that seems likely, but we'd have to
turn over every stone in la-la land to find it.

01:32:26.520 --> 01:32:29.000
LAURA: Or we have to talk to him and find out,
and maybe...

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:32.100
TRAVIS: Yeah, and you can talk to trees.

01:32:32.100 --> 01:32:36.690
MARISHA: I can. I can attempt to talk to the
tree.

01:32:36.690 --> 01:32:38.600
TALIESIN: After a rest, I'm going to sleep.

01:32:38.600 --> 01:32:39.750
LIAM: Scanlan and Keyleth combo?

01:32:39.750 --> 01:32:40.690
MARISHA: Huh?

01:32:40.690 --> 01:32:43.560
LIAM: Scanlan and Keyleth duo to talk to the
tree?

01:32:43.560 --> 01:32:45.340
SAM: What are we asking the tree?

01:32:45.340 --> 01:32:46.470
LAURA: In the morning.

01:32:46.470 --> 01:32:47.830
SAM: Yeah, but what are we--

01:32:47.830 --> 01:32:49.070
TRAVIS: Who betrayed it.

01:32:49.070 --> 01:32:52.280
LAURA: We're gonna talk to Sondur and see,
you know, why are you acting this way?

01:32:52.280 --> 01:32:55.410
LIAM: Yes, how can we help you, how can we fix
what's going on?

01:32:55.410 --> 01:32:58.860
LAURA: Oh no, look at his face, he looks like that
is a very bad idea.

01:32:58.860 --> 01:33:00.000
MARISHA: (laughs) Why are you acting this way?

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:04.220
MATT: No, I'm just, I'm just enjoying you guys
planning and plotting.

01:33:04.220 --> 01:33:07.600
SAM: We're just gonna say hey, Sondur, how can we
help you?

01:33:07.600 --> 01:33:10.730
LAURA: Yeah yeah yeah, like how can we help you?
Why are you hurting?

01:33:10.730 --> 01:33:12.360
MARISHA: Please give us your bow, yeah.

01:33:12.360 --> 01:33:15.100
LAURA: No, no, don't even bring up the bow right
now, let's just try to help him out.

01:33:15.100 --> 01:33:21.420
MARISHA: So wait, are we here on a mission to
cleanse the land? Is that what we're posing as?

01:33:21.420 --> 01:33:23.500
We're like missionaries?

01:33:23.500 --> 01:33:26.420
LAURA: I mean, if we did cleanse the land,
that would be a wonderful thing.

01:33:26.420 --> 01:33:27.740
TALIESIN: That would be great.

01:33:27.740 --> 01:33:29.390
MARISHA: It would be a wonderful thing.

01:33:29.390 --> 01:33:31.000
TALIESIN: But we're also getting the bow.

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:34.780
LAURA: The bow is a wonderful thing. I have a
pretty fucking cool bow now, I don't even know if

01:33:34.780 --> 01:33:38.860
this new one's gonna be as cool. You don't even
know what Mythcarver does, Titanstone Knuckles

01:33:38.860 --> 01:33:42.600
aren't advancing at all, who knows? Maybe this bow
is shit and

01:33:42.600 --> 01:33:45.740
the whole point of this is so we can help people.

01:33:45.740 --> 01:33:47.790
TALIESIN: I think it'll give you wings so you can
fly.

01:33:47.790 --> 01:33:49.870
TRAVIS: Can't we just say that we're obsessed with
the hundred-foot fucking

01:33:49.870 --> 01:33:52.170
moving tree in the middle of the Feywild?

01:33:52.170 --> 01:33:54.170
LAURA: Maybe we just think it's really cool.

01:33:54.170 --> 01:33:56.620
TRAVIS: Yeah, we've come to talk to it, no
bullshit.

01:33:56.620 --> 01:33:57.710
SAM: We're fanboys.

01:33:57.710 --> 01:33:58.500
LAURA: Yeah.

01:33:58.500 --> 01:33:59.260
TRAVIS: No.

01:33:59.260 --> 01:34:00.860
LAURA: Yeah, like we've heard tale and it's
wonderful.

01:34:00.860 --> 01:34:02.570
TRAVIS: We wanna know what's up.

01:34:02.570 --> 01:34:04.940
SAM: Great. That sounds like it's gonna end well.

01:34:04.940 --> 01:34:06.890
TRAVIS: Well, if he pulls any shit then we kill
it.

01:34:06.890 --> 01:34:07.900
SAM: Okay.

01:34:07.900 --> 01:34:12.560
TALIESIN: I am going to sleep, there's nothing
that can be solved right now that cannot be solved

01:34:12.560 --> 01:34:14.440
over coffee and bacon.

01:34:14.440 --> 01:34:16.200
LAURA: We don't have bacon.

01:34:16.200 --> 01:34:17.540
MARISHA: Just chicken and waffles.

01:34:17.540 --> 01:34:19.100
TALIESIN: I will make bacon from chicken.

01:34:19.100 --> 01:34:20.580
SAM: Chicken-skin bacon.

01:34:20.580 --> 01:34:21.770
LAURA: Ooh. That actually sounds really good.

01:34:21.770 --> 01:34:23.230
TALIESIN: That actually sounds really good.

01:34:23.230 --> 01:34:24.750
LIAM: Tofurkey.

01:34:24.750 --> 01:34:26.520
MATT: All right. You guys all taking your long
rest?

01:34:26.520 --> 01:34:27.860
(Various sounds of agreement.)

01:34:27.860 --> 01:34:28.940
MATT: All right, you all--

01:34:28.940 --> 01:34:30.740
LIAM: No, I'm going to knock on my sister's door
before she falls asleep.

01:34:30.740 --> 01:34:31.810
MATT: All right.

01:34:31.810 --> 01:34:33.800
LAURA: Oh shit, I'm pretty tired, what's up?

01:34:33.800 --> 01:34:39.700
LIAM: Hey, well, you know, we don't get a lot of
time to talk alone because everything is so fucked

01:34:39.700 --> 01:34:49.950
up, but you seemed really on-edge. More than
normal, when we lived there before.

01:34:49.950 --> 01:34:51.640
You know what I'm talking about.

01:34:51.640 --> 01:34:53.520
LAURA: Oh, yeah.

01:34:53.520 --> 01:34:56.170
LIAM: Are you all right?

01:34:56.170 --> 01:35:13.550
LAURA: Um. Yes? I don't know. It's the weirdest
thing, I never realized how much it affected me

01:35:13.550 --> 01:35:22.680
until we actually were faced with it again.
It was good, standing in front of him with

01:35:22.680 --> 01:35:27.860
everyone else, wasn't it?

01:35:27.860 --> 01:35:37.670
LIAM: I've... he's not a concern for me anymore.
I don't think fondly back on it, we have bigger

01:35:37.670 --> 01:35:48.090
things on our plates, but I do care how he affects
you, and there is no question how much it affected

01:35:48.090 --> 01:35:56.350
you when Percival made his offer in that room,
and I was a little surprised. And I'm not trying

01:35:56.350 --> 01:36:06.760
to start an argument or anything like that,
I know why he did it, of course. And every fairy

01:36:06.760 --> 01:36:14.850
within a thousand miles of that room could see how
deeply it affected you, and it surprised me,

01:36:14.850 --> 01:36:27.030
because... Look, if that makes you happy,
it is to be embraced, and I'm certainly in

01:36:27.030 --> 01:36:35.340
support of anything that gives our father
heartburn, but...

01:36:35.340 --> 01:36:48.540
I'm sorry, his offer, in your brother's
eyes, is a bit like gilding a lily or framing a

01:36:48.540 --> 01:37:04.660
sunset. You have always been the coolest person I
have known, ever, in my life. And you still are.

01:37:04.660 --> 01:37:19.860
You're already perfect, at least in your
brother's eyes. And I guess I just hope you

01:37:19.860 --> 01:37:28.130
believe in you as much as I do, because it's quite
a bit.

01:37:28.130 --> 01:37:37.410
LAURA: Thank you. I mean, I can't give back the
title, that would be kind of shit.

01:37:37.410 --> 01:37:39.550
LIAM: Well, you're a countessa know, I understand,
that's what you are.

01:37:39.550 --> 01:37:42.070
LAURA: Baroness, no, baroness, actually.

01:37:42.070 --> 01:37:46.690
LIAM: All right.

01:37:46.690 --> 01:37:52.870
LAURA: Just a little bit cooler than before.
Just a little?

01:37:52.870 --> 01:37:59.520
LIAM: Whatever floats your boat, Stubby, but,
you know. Just don't wuss out on me now.

01:37:59.520 --> 01:38:01.130
LAURA: I won't.

01:38:01.130 --> 01:38:03.730
LIAM: All right? You've always been stronger than
me, I need you to keep doing that.

01:38:03.730 --> 01:38:07.040
LAURA: It's all an act, dear.

01:38:07.040 --> 01:38:14.570
LIAM: Bullshit. That's it.

01:38:14.570 --> 01:38:18.390
LAURA: I love you. Thank you.

01:38:18.390 --> 01:38:21.370
LIAM: I love you too.

01:38:21.370 --> 01:38:24.080
LAURA: Go get some sleep. Your feathers are all
ruffled.

01:38:24.080 --> 01:38:32.360
LIAM: All right.

01:38:32.360 --> 01:38:36.840
MATT: All right, so as you separate and go find
your own ways to rest, you guys find your way to

01:38:36.840 --> 01:38:43.740
your dreams for the evening, getting a full
night's rest, HP resolved to full, spells

01:38:43.740 --> 01:38:46.540
returned, and we're gonna go ahead and take a
break. 

01:38:46.540 --> 01:38:50.480
MATT: Welcome back, everyone. So, we had a quick
break, you guys, coming to consciousness the next

01:38:50.480 --> 01:38:58.800
morning, freshly rested, the smell of some cooked
chicken in the downstairs area

01:38:58.800 --> 01:39:01.900
and a little bit of
chicken-skin bacon...

01:39:01.900 --> 01:39:05.680
LAURA: Can I go knock on Percy's door before we
head downstairs, just really fast?

01:39:05.680 --> 01:39:07.180
MATT: Yeah.

01:39:07.180 --> 01:39:10.060
LAURA: Um. Percival?

01:39:10.060 --> 01:39:11.560
TALIESIN: Yes, yes, good morning.

01:39:11.560 --> 01:39:16.150
LAURA: Sorry. Good morning. I forgot you're grumpy
when you wake up.

01:39:16.150 --> 01:39:17.910
TALIESIN: It's all right.

01:39:17.910 --> 01:39:25.540
LAURA: Look, Vax came and talked to me last night,
and he actually reminded me of something that I

01:39:25.540 --> 01:39:28.310
forgot to say to you, which is: thank you.
Seriously.

01:39:28.310 --> 01:39:34.330
We haven't really had a moment to say
anything, and...

01:39:34.330 --> 01:39:35.470
TALIESIN: No.

01:39:35.470 --> 01:39:45.910
LAURA: Really, what you did back in Syngorn was
more than I ever expected, and honestly it's,

01:39:45.910 --> 01:39:53.290
I don't know of any other time that somebody has
stuck up for me quite as much, outside of Vax.

01:39:53.290 --> 01:39:55.960
So thank you.

01:39:55.960 --> 01:40:01.740
TALIESIN: You're welcome. And... it's the lovely
thing about a title, and I had one to give,

01:40:01.740 --> 01:40:10.680
is that it's, when used appropriately and
properly, it's mostly there to remind you you

01:40:10.680 --> 01:40:12.300
don't really need it.

01:40:12.300 --> 01:40:15.610
LAURA: Right. Question, though?

01:40:15.610 --> 01:40:16.970
TALIESIN: Yes?

01:40:16.970 --> 01:40:25.210
LAURA: Because I sort of realized, being a
baroness of Whitestone, that I literally owe my

01:40:25.210 --> 01:40:28.390
fealty and allegiance to... you.

01:40:28.390 --> 01:40:30.420
TALIESIN: Yes.

01:40:30.420 --> 01:40:31.640
LAURA: All right.

01:40:31.640 --> 01:40:33.960
TALIESIN: Well, technically my sister, but yes.

01:40:33.960 --> 01:40:34.910
LAURA: Okay.

01:40:34.910 --> 01:40:36.680
TALIESIN: If that makes you feel a little better.

01:40:36.680 --> 01:40:42.810
LAURA: Thank you, Grand Sire de Rolo, and if
there's anything you ever need in return,

01:40:42.810 --> 01:40:44.050
all you have to do is ask.

01:40:44.050 --> 01:40:51.180
TALIESIN: Never do that again, that was very
weird. It was really, it was... it was worth it to

01:40:51.180 --> 01:40:52.780
see the look on his face.

01:40:52.780 --> 01:40:54.090
LAURA: It was quite wonderful.

01:40:54.090 --> 01:40:57.460
TALIESIN: It was quite wonderful. No, and it
worked out well, because technically speaking

01:40:57.460 --> 01:41:02.130
there's only really about 15 foot square that's
actually standing

01:41:02.130 --> 01:41:05.950
that you technically have a baronry over.

01:41:05.950 --> 01:41:06.780
LAURA: Oh.

01:41:06.780 --> 01:41:10.130
TALIESIN: And at the moment it is currently a
shrine to the Raven Queen,

01:41:10.130 --> 01:41:11.920
so that works out well.

01:41:11.920 --> 01:41:16.770
LAURA: Oh, that's what... so technically we gave
it to Zahra, didn't we?

01:41:16.770 --> 01:41:18.390
TALIESIN: No, she's just fixing it up for us.

01:41:18.390 --> 01:41:19.810
LAURA: Okay, all right.

01:41:19.810 --> 01:41:27.170
TALIESIN: We did not give it to her. It wasn't
mine to give. Just the title. You're welcome,

01:41:27.170 --> 01:41:32.530
and... it doesn't change anything.

01:41:32.530 --> 01:41:35.600
LAURA: Good, that would be very strange,
wouldn't it?

01:41:35.600 --> 01:41:37.290
TALIESIN: Yeah. Although I imagine you're
eventually going to

01:41:37.290 --> 01:41:40.390
become very insufferable, but yes.

01:41:40.390 --> 01:41:41.910
LAURA: Only sometimes, dear.

01:41:41.910 --> 01:41:44.540
TALIESIN: Oh, you have to be... there's a thing.
But we'll get to that later. There is a thing,

01:41:44.540 --> 01:41:46.950
I forgot, there is a thing.

01:41:46.950 --> 01:41:49.120
LAURA: Does it have to do with the Hunt?

01:41:49.120 --> 01:41:52.300
TALIESIN: Yes, a thing, we'll get to that,
it's really not important right now. That's if we

01:41:52.300 --> 01:41:55.290
survive, that would be very important, but right
now it's not.

01:41:55.290 --> 01:41:57.190
LAURA: Not... not a given.

01:41:57.190 --> 01:41:58.010
TALIESIN: No.

01:41:58.010 --> 01:41:59.280
LAURA: We might die today.

01:41:59.280 --> 01:42:00.130
TALIESIN: We might.

01:42:00.130 --> 01:42:01.600
LAURA: I'm gonna get some coffee.

01:42:01.600 --> 01:42:04.050
TALIESIN: I think that's an excellent idea.
Let me join you.

01:42:04.050 --> 01:42:11.660
MATT: You all eventually find your way down,
breakfast served in a central dining table with

01:42:11.660 --> 01:42:13.910
no platters, no silverware.

01:42:13.910 --> 01:42:15.550
LAURA: Thanks, Grog.

01:42:15.550 --> 01:42:18.280
TRAVIS: It's a mansion! We could eat somewhere
else.

01:42:18.280 --> 01:42:22.110
MATT: The meals are just placed literally on the
table.

01:42:22.110 --> 01:42:26.960
TRAVIS: Bare-bones. I like it.

01:42:26.960 --> 01:42:30.320
SAM: All right, eat up, let's go.

01:42:30.320 --> 01:42:35.170
MATT: You finish your meal, and you guys prepared
yourselves, what are you doing?

01:42:35.170 --> 01:42:36.790
SAM: We go out into the world, right?

01:42:36.790 --> 01:42:37.890
TRAVIS: Bum-rush the tree.

01:42:37.890 --> 01:42:38.850
LAURA: Uh-uh.

01:42:38.850 --> 01:42:40.380
TALIESIN: I have shoes for everybody.

01:42:40.380 --> 01:42:42.080
SAM: Oh!

01:42:42.080 --> 01:42:43.060
MARISHA: Yes.

01:42:43.060 --> 01:42:44.360
SAM: Those are terrible shoes.

01:42:44.360 --> 01:42:45.890
TALIESIN: They're awful, I'm aware.

01:42:45.890 --> 01:42:47.270
TRAVIS: We put the shoes on?

01:42:47.270 --> 01:42:48.340
LIAM: What do they look like?

01:42:48.340 --> 01:42:49.650
TALIESIN: We're going to wear the shoes.

01:42:49.650 --> 01:42:50.320
SAM: Yeah, describe them.

01:42:50.320 --> 01:42:53.610
TALIESIN: They're swamp shoes. They're circular,
they're like large circles, and there's like a

01:42:53.610 --> 01:42:56.640
base connected to them, and whole thing's
connected together with ropes.

01:42:56.640 --> 01:43:00.050
MARISHA: Kind of like snowshoes but with more
surface area.

01:43:00.050 --> 01:43:01.730
TRAVIS: I'm only wearing that if it helps.

01:43:01.730 --> 01:43:06.400
TALIESIN: It does. It will keep you from sinking
into the muck. It will allow you to, you'll have

01:43:06.400 --> 01:43:10.920
to walk very slowly, you can't walk very quickly,
and if things get hairy you can cut them off,

01:43:10.920 --> 01:43:13.610
they're just wood and rope, they're not that
complicated.

01:43:13.610 --> 01:43:15.440
MARISHA: Basically, wood paddles on our feet.

01:43:15.440 --> 01:43:17.390
TALIESIN: Yes. Move like a giant frog.

01:43:17.390 --> 01:43:18.610
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:43:18.610 --> 01:43:20.380
TRAVIS: I put the giant frog-shoes on.

01:43:20.380 --> 01:43:24.150
MATT: All right, you put them on. You guys exit
the mansion?

01:43:24.150 --> 01:43:28.050
LIAM: I set the Deathwalker's Ward for necrotic
damage.

01:43:28.050 --> 01:43:30.060
MATT: Okay, necrotic damage is set. Okay.
As you guys emerge--

01:43:30.060 --> 01:43:35.120
LAURA: Oh. Wait.

01:43:35.120 --> 01:43:37.460
TALIESIN: You don't need them, though. You're the
one person who doesn't need them.

01:43:37.460 --> 01:43:42.090
LAURA: How long does Protection Against Poison
last? Oh, it's only an hour, okay, so no,

01:43:42.090 --> 01:43:43.470
I don't want to cast it yet.

01:43:43.470 --> 01:43:44.560
MATT: Okay.

01:43:44.560 --> 01:43:45.840
MARISHA: But you have that.

01:43:45.840 --> 01:43:46.700
LAURA: I do.

01:43:46.700 --> 01:43:47.880
MARISHA: I won't take that.

01:43:47.880 --> 01:43:49.670
SAM: Maybe now would be, we're going straight to
the tree, right?

01:43:49.670 --> 01:43:50.930
MARISHA: Are we still doing our--

01:43:50.930 --> 01:43:52.140
LAURA: Aren't you going to try to talk to it?

01:43:52.140 --> 01:43:56.630
TALIESIN: Talk to it, see what happens, and if
everything goes terribly, we just retreat back to

01:43:56.630 --> 01:43:58.710
the mansion, it's not going anywhere anytime
soon.

01:43:58.710 --> 01:44:00.330
SAM: Should any of us hide?

01:44:00.330 --> 01:44:02.080
TALIESIN: I'm going to keep back in the treeline.

01:44:02.080 --> 01:44:06.600
LAURA: I can only cast it on one person, though,
Keyleth. I don't have, I'm not as good with

01:44:06.600 --> 01:44:10.180
spells as you, so if you can do it to multiple
people, it might be good.

01:44:10.180 --> 01:44:12.330
MATT: All right.

01:44:12.330 --> 01:44:14.780
LIAM: Do we have any fancy, um, fancy--

01:44:14.780 --> 01:44:15.740
LAURA: (posh voice) Fancy?

01:44:15.740 --> 01:44:20.740
LIAM: Crystal bowls for Keyleth to crush up and
feed us from?

01:44:20.740 --> 01:44:21.600
LAURA: What?

01:44:21.600 --> 01:44:22.420
SAM: Crystal what?

01:44:22.420 --> 01:44:23.590
LAURA: Oh, like a Fancy--

01:44:23.590 --> 01:44:24.680
LIAM: Heroes' Feast, yeah.

01:44:24.680 --> 01:44:29.320
LAURA: Heroes' Feast? I don't know if we have--

01:44:29.320 --> 01:44:30.200
LIAM: Never mind.

01:44:30.200 --> 01:44:31.780
MATT: I don't think you have one purchased and
ready.

01:44:31.780 --> 01:44:33.040
TALIESIN: I don't think we have one.

01:44:33.040 --> 01:44:35.350
LIAM: I don't claim to understand anything.

01:44:35.350 --> 01:44:37.170
MARISHA: We'd have to make that decision now,
while I'm learning

01:44:37.170 --> 01:44:39.270
my spells at the top of the day.

01:44:39.270 --> 01:44:40.110
TALIESIN: No, no.

01:44:40.110 --> 01:44:41.080
SAM: Don't do it.

01:44:41.080 --> 01:44:42.310
LAURA: We should've done it last night if we were
gonna do it.

01:44:42.310 --> 01:44:43.540
MATT: Yeah.

01:44:43.540 --> 01:44:45.410
TALIESIN: It'll be fine.

01:44:45.410 --> 01:44:49.680
LAURA: It's gonna be fine, we're all gonna die.

01:44:49.680 --> 01:44:51.840
SAM: All right.

01:44:51.840 --> 01:44:55.800
LAURA: How are you guys gonna go talk to him,
are you just like walking to him?

01:44:55.800 --> 01:44:58.700
TALIESIN: A tree is just a door that hasn't been
made yet, remember.

01:44:58.700 --> 01:45:05.520
MARISHA: That is true. That is an old Druidish
proverb.

01:45:05.520 --> 01:45:07.270
TALIESIN: It's an old Druidish one?

01:45:07.270 --> 01:45:09.880
MARISHA: Yep.

01:45:09.880 --> 01:45:10.400
TALIESIN: Thank you.

01:45:10.400 --> 01:45:13.390
MATT: All right. So. You guys emerge from the
mansion?

01:45:13.390 --> 01:45:14.790
SAM: Yeah, anyone want to go stealth or anything?

01:45:14.790 --> 01:45:15.910
LAURA: Yeah yeah yeah.

01:45:15.910 --> 01:45:17.880
SAM: It's just gonna be all of us presenting
ourself?

01:45:17.880 --> 01:45:21.410
LAURA: Maybe we'll go stealth... well, can a tree
see us? I dunno. Let's go stealth.

01:45:21.410 --> 01:45:23.400
MATT: All right.

01:45:23.400 --> 01:45:25.200
LAURA: Why not? And you guys can go talk to it.

01:45:25.200 --> 01:45:26.120
SAM: All right.

01:45:26.120 --> 01:45:27.910
MATT: Roll stealth checks as you emerge from the
mansion,

01:45:27.910 --> 01:45:31.250
up into the boughs of the tree where you
left the exit.

01:45:31.250 --> 01:45:34.470
TRAVIS: You don't think we're, like, perfectly on
this tree's radar?

01:45:34.470 --> 01:45:37.530
That going stealth is
insulting?

01:45:37.530 --> 01:45:39.500
MARISHA: I'm kinda wondering if the tree has a
tremor-sense.

01:45:39.500 --> 01:45:42.060
LAURA: Oh, that's true. All right, all right,
you're right.

01:45:42.060 --> 01:45:44.920
SAM: Don't do stealth, I'll present us all as a
group.

01:45:44.920 --> 01:45:46.340
LAURA: Okay.

01:45:46.340 --> 01:45:53.170
MATT: All right. You emerge. Still the dusklight,
that kind of warm purplish-orange perpetual

01:45:53.170 --> 01:45:58.540
sunset glow in the sky. The tree there remains.
You glance out. That little pocket where the

01:45:58.540 --> 01:46:04.190
trees were is filled once more. The trees now
stand, the pocket is now done.

01:46:04.190 --> 01:46:07.680
LAURA: That's where, that's where the hole was!
But it's not a hole anymore!

01:46:07.680 --> 01:46:13.290
MATT: Make a perception check as you're looking.

01:46:13.290 --> 01:46:15.320
LAURA: That's good, that's good. 29.

01:46:15.320 --> 01:46:22.860
MATT: 29. About three-quarters of a mile further
west from your current location, there is now a

01:46:22.860 --> 01:46:28.290
different opening in the canopy, similar size,
but even further out that way.

01:46:28.290 --> 01:46:34.190
LAURA: What the fuck? It's further away.
Trees fucking moved. At least it's further away

01:46:34.190 --> 01:46:36.260
from us and not closer to us.

01:46:36.260 --> 01:46:41.940
MARISHA: Wait, is it the same... maybe it is
something big blocking it, with like an invisible

01:46:41.940 --> 01:46:46.900
field? I don't know. I don't know.

01:46:46.900 --> 01:46:50.140
MATT: So. What's the plan?

01:46:50.140 --> 01:46:56.940
SAM: We have no plan. So let's just walk right up.
I take, me and Keyleth take tip of the spear,

01:46:56.940 --> 01:46:59.520
and we just walk right up to the base of the
tree.

01:46:59.520 --> 01:47:00.730
LAURA: I float on my broom.

01:47:00.730 --> 01:47:03.260
MATT: Okay, so. What's the marching order?

01:47:03.260 --> 01:47:04.880
SAM: Scanlan and Keyleth first.

01:47:04.880 --> 01:47:06.210
MATT: Scanlan and Keyleth at the front.

01:47:06.210 --> 01:47:07.670
LAURA: Oh no, oh no.

01:47:07.670 --> 01:47:08.750
MATT: Who's after them?

01:47:08.750 --> 01:47:09.740
TRAVIS: I'm in the middle.

01:47:09.740 --> 01:47:11.410
MATT: All right, so Grog's up next.

01:47:11.410 --> 01:47:12.850
LAURA: Trinket's behind Grog.

01:47:12.850 --> 01:47:17.550
MATT: Trinket's behind Grog, all righty.
Percy? Vax? Are you guys holding up the rear?

01:47:17.550 --> 01:47:19.060
TALIESIN: Yes.

01:47:19.060 --> 01:47:20.240
MATT: And you're on the broom above.

01:47:20.240 --> 01:47:21.490
LAURA: I'm on the broom, yes.

01:47:21.490 --> 01:47:22.530
MATT: All right, got it.

01:47:22.530 --> 01:47:24.850
LIAM: I actually think I want to tail Grog.

01:47:24.850 --> 01:47:25.710
MATT: All right.

01:47:25.710 --> 01:47:26.630
LIAM: Thank you.

01:47:26.630 --> 01:47:27.820
TALIESIN: I'll take the rear, then.

01:47:27.820 --> 01:47:31.650
MATT: All right, so Percy's at the rear,
Vax and Trinket are both right behind Grog as you

01:47:31.650 --> 01:47:37.490
guys push forward. You touch down in the swamp,
the actual thickness of the morass, moving

01:47:37.490 --> 01:47:40.270
forward very slowly with the swamp shoes.
Grog,

01:47:40.270 --> 01:47:43.600
you get two steps before they break under
your weight.

01:47:43.600 --> 01:47:44.780
TRAVIS: Good.

01:47:44.780 --> 01:47:46.140
MARISHA: We tried.

01:47:46.140 --> 01:47:47.720
TRAVIS: I take them off.

01:47:47.720 --> 01:47:52.980
MATT: Okay. But the rest of you, it does help,
you are not sinking. Your progress is very slow,

01:47:52.980 --> 01:47:57.110
slower than it was previously when you were
already at half-speed, but you aren't breaking the

01:47:57.110 --> 01:48:01.640
surface of the actual substance. It is sticky,
and you have to pull it forth, and it is tension

01:48:01.640 --> 01:48:05.780
put on the ropes, but for the most part,
most of you are light of foot, and it's not a

01:48:05.780 --> 01:48:13.620
huge issue. Except for you. Trinket's just up to
his elbows, just (sloshing) through the water.

01:48:13.620 --> 01:48:14.970
LAURA: Does he look miserable?

01:48:14.970 --> 01:48:16.410
MATT: He's not enjoying himself.

01:48:16.410 --> 01:48:18.730
LAURA: Do you wanna go in the crystal? Okay.

01:48:18.730 --> 01:48:20.460
MATT: And he just keeps pushing forward.

01:48:20.460 --> 01:48:22.340
LIAM: All right, I'm scritching his ears while we
walk.

01:48:22.340 --> 01:48:24.880
LAURA: Thank you.

01:48:24.880 --> 01:48:30.060
MATT: You push onward. It's not too far of a
distance, it takes you ten or fifteen minutes to

01:48:30.060 --> 01:48:36.630
reach the very base of the tree where you had
previously scoped out. The large roots climb up

01:48:36.630 --> 01:48:43.350
ten, 12 feet before emerging from the base of this
large tree. Maybe, at this point you can look at

01:48:43.350 --> 01:48:50.630
it now, taller than you thought at a distance.
It's roughly 80 to 100 feet in width and probably

01:48:50.630 --> 01:48:56.150
over 150 to 200 feet tall. It is just a thick,
solid, giant tree.

01:48:56.150 --> 01:48:58.680
LAURA: That is a huge-ass tree.

01:48:58.680 --> 01:49:06.190
SAM: As we approach, I take a little muck and I'm
going to draw like a little tree on my forehead

01:49:06.190 --> 01:49:10.690
and one on Keyleth's forehead as well.

01:49:10.690 --> 01:49:12.190
MARISHA: What are you drawing?

01:49:12.190 --> 01:49:14.070
SAM: Just like a little mud tree on your
forehead.

01:49:14.070 --> 01:49:14.950
MARISHA: Oh, yeah.

01:49:14.950 --> 01:49:16.600
LIAM: Not a penis at all.

01:49:16.600 --> 01:49:18.350
LAURA: Oh, yeah.

01:49:18.350 --> 01:49:20.000
MARISHA: How is my tree?

01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:21.640
LAURA: Looks kind of like a dick.

01:49:21.640 --> 01:49:22.770
MARISHA: Scanlan!

01:49:22.770 --> 01:49:24.950
SAM: Don't worry. It's for a good cause.

01:49:24.950 --> 01:49:31.790
MATT: You step up to the heavy roots there,
and the mass of vines that are all clustered and

01:49:31.790 --> 01:49:35.370
matted together. What do you do?

01:49:35.370 --> 01:49:36.810
TRAVIS: We fan out.

01:49:36.810 --> 01:49:38.630
SAM: Just a little bit.

01:49:38.630 --> 01:49:40.620
LAURA: Yeah, we kind of branch, we just spread out
a little bit.

01:49:40.620 --> 01:49:42.590
MATT: All right, so you guys spread out a little
bit.

01:49:42.590 --> 01:49:44.070
MARISHA: Are we trying to talk to it first?

01:49:44.070 --> 01:49:47.540
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, talk to it. Be charming.

01:49:47.540 --> 01:50:00.560
SAM: I call out to it. Sondur! Sondur, hear us! We
are your devotees! We have come to pay homage and

01:50:00.560 --> 01:50:06.140
respect to you. We follow your ways and your
teachings.

01:50:06.140 --> 01:50:11.640
MARISHA: And I make myself to look like the
tree-dick on my forehead.

01:50:11.640 --> 01:50:16.670
SAM: We wear your mark on our heads to show
respect.

01:50:16.670 --> 01:50:24.660
Please show us your power and grant us
your blessings.

01:50:24.660 --> 01:50:33.540
MATT: Long absence of sound following your
statement. Couple of small vines as part of that

01:50:33.540 --> 01:50:38.130
knotted mess kind of twist tighter and then relax.

01:50:38.130 --> 01:50:41.050
Does not appear to be any sort of reaction beyond
that.

01:50:41.050 --> 01:50:42.640
MARISHA: I cast Speak with Plants.

01:50:42.640 --> 01:50:43.380
SAM: Okay.

01:50:43.380 --> 01:50:44.680
MATT: All right.

01:50:44.680 --> 01:50:50.540
LAURA: Just repeat--

01:50:50.540 --> 01:50:52.780
MARISHA: Are you waiting for me?

01:50:52.780 --> 01:50:57.310
MATT: You imbue plants within 30 feet of you with
limited sentience and animation, giving them the

01:50:57.310 --> 01:51:02.560
ability to communicate with you and to follow your
simple commands.

01:51:02.560 --> 01:51:07.910
MARISHA: Sondur. Can you hear me?

01:51:07.910 --> 01:51:10.760
SAM: Question one.

01:51:10.760 --> 01:51:16.730
MATT: There is no response.

01:51:16.730 --> 01:51:28.220
MARISHA: I am Keyleth from the Air Ashari.
Druids of the prime realm.

01:51:28.220 --> 01:51:32.810
Are you still present?

01:51:32.810 --> 01:51:43.070
MATT: This low, cracking, creaking sound of heavy
wood on wood-fall begins to slowly emerge in your

01:51:43.070 --> 01:51:45.390
head. It just says,

01:51:45.390 --> 01:51:52.950
"I am here."

01:51:52.950 --> 01:51:55.280
MARISHA: We would like to see your heart.

01:51:55.280 --> 01:51:56.490
LAURA: What?

01:51:56.490 --> 01:51:57.570
SAM: Wow. Straight to it.

01:51:57.570 --> 01:51:58.970
LAURA: Just straight-up. Just right in.

01:51:58.970 --> 01:52:03.160
SAM: Just straight to it. Just go straight for...
I wanna spend the night with you.

01:52:03.160 --> 01:52:04.640
Just straight there.

01:52:04.640 --> 01:52:11.450
MATT: There's a pause. You hear, (snapping
sounds), and you notice the vines, some are

01:52:11.450 --> 01:52:15.760
pulling and snapping while others begin to slowly
pull apart.

01:52:15.760 --> 01:52:20.930
That giant mass of vines that are clustered
between two of the large roots that merge with the

01:52:21.140 --> 01:52:29.190
tree? Begin to untangle and fall free, revealing
what appears to be a slowly opening pathway into

01:52:29.190 --> 01:52:37.640
the tree itself. You now see what looks to be
about four and a half feet tall and about three

01:52:37.640 --> 01:52:42.550
feet wide, a tunnel, like a crack in the bark
itself,

01:52:42.550 --> 01:52:45.140
that disappears into darkness deeper into
the tree.

01:52:45.140 --> 01:52:46.340
LAURA: No.

01:52:46.340 --> 01:52:51.360
MARISHA: Me and my fellow companions are coming
in.

01:52:51.360 --> 01:52:53.060
LAURA: No, this is so stupid.

01:52:53.060 --> 01:52:54.440
SAM: Coming in?

01:52:54.440 --> 01:52:55.110
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:52:55.110 --> 01:52:56.170
SAM: All right.

01:52:56.170 --> 01:52:57.020
TRAVIS: Wait, how big is it?

01:52:57.020 --> 01:52:58.120
MARISHA: I go in first.

01:52:58.120 --> 01:52:58.870
SAM: Wait, you're going in?

01:52:58.870 --> 01:52:59.960
LAURA: What, you're just going in?

01:52:59.960 --> 01:53:00.720
SAM: Going with Kiki.

01:53:00.720 --> 01:53:01.520
TALIESIN: Going in.

01:53:01.520 --> 01:53:02.960
TRAVIS: You said four and a half feet...

01:53:02.960 --> 01:53:04.690
MATT: Four and a half feet tall, about three feet
wide.

01:53:04.690 --> 01:53:06.110
LAURA: So we can all fit in.

01:53:06.110 --> 01:53:08.040
MATT: Well, you're gonna have to practically crawl
to get in there, Grog.

01:53:08.040 --> 01:53:08.960
TRAVIS: Not this guy.

01:53:08.960 --> 01:53:09.910
LAURA: You can fit in there.

01:53:09.910 --> 01:53:10.920
MATT: You can fit, but you're gonna have to
crawl.

01:53:10.920 --> 01:53:11.760
MARISHA: Just army crawl.

01:53:11.760 --> 01:53:12.960
LAURA: Can Trinket fit through?

01:53:12.960 --> 01:53:14.280
LIAM: It's gonna be a squeaker.

01:53:14.280 --> 01:53:17.540
MATT: Trinket's gonna have to get down and like--

01:53:17.540 --> 01:53:18.520
SAM: Your Pokeball.

01:53:18.520 --> 01:53:20.980
LAURA: I know, I can just put him in the crystal
and then--

01:53:20.980 --> 01:53:22.020
MATT: You can do that too, yeah.

01:53:22.020 --> 01:53:22.980
LAURA: I'll put him in the crystal.

01:53:22.980 --> 01:53:25.480
MATT: Okay. Trinket into the Raven's Slumber.

01:53:25.480 --> 01:53:26.300
SAM: Do you want to stay outside?

01:53:26.300 --> 01:53:27.600
LAURA: Grog, you can do it.

01:53:27.600 --> 01:53:28.800
TRAVIS: Not normally.

01:53:28.800 --> 01:53:30.010
LAURA: Turn your shoulders.

01:53:30.010 --> 01:53:31.720
TALIESIN: (chicken noises)

01:53:31.720 --> 01:53:37.100
LIAM: Could you pour some Crisco out of that magic
jug of yours and lube up?

01:53:37.100 --> 01:53:38.630
LAURA: Yeah, oil yourself up, real good.

01:53:38.630 --> 01:53:40.230
MATT: Just Winnie the Pooh you through?

01:53:40.230 --> 01:53:42.990
SAM: Mayonnaise. Mayonnaise is slippery. Butter.

01:53:42.990 --> 01:53:44.930
LIAM: This is Sparta. Come on.

01:53:44.930 --> 01:53:46.070
TRAVIS: I'm going in, I'm going in.

01:53:46.070 --> 01:53:47.680
MATT: Oh, bother.

01:53:47.680 --> 01:53:48.290
LAURA: Oh, bother.

01:53:48.290 --> 01:53:50.440
MATT: I don't know why he's British suddenly.
All right, so, marching order.

01:53:50.440 --> 01:53:51.510
Who's going in first?

01:53:51.510 --> 01:53:52.280
MARISHA: Me.

01:53:52.280 --> 01:53:52.960
MATT: Keyleth.

01:53:52.960 --> 01:53:53.740
SAM: And me second.

01:53:53.740 --> 01:53:55.270
MATT: And Scanlan, who's going in after them?

01:53:55.270 --> 01:53:56.140
LIAM: I am.

01:53:56.140 --> 01:53:57.410
LAURA: Then me, behind him.

01:53:57.410 --> 01:53:58.950
MATT: Vax, Vex.

01:53:58.950 --> 01:53:59.990
TALIESIN: Then me.

01:53:59.990 --> 01:54:02.150
MATT: Percy. And then finally Grog.

01:54:02.150 --> 01:54:04.760
LAURA: Grog!

01:54:04.760 --> 01:54:05.670
MATT: All right.

01:54:05.670 --> 01:54:07.340
MARISHA: Bringing up the rear this time, Grog.

01:54:07.340 --> 01:54:08.990
MATT: So.

01:54:08.990 --> 01:54:12.150
LIAM: Here comes the general.

01:54:12.150 --> 01:54:15.240
MATT: As you begin to make your way into this
entrance to the tree--

01:54:15.240 --> 01:54:17.440
LAURA: Oh no. We are so dumb.

01:54:17.440 --> 01:54:22.110
MATT: This scent catches you as soon as you step
five, ten feet into the darkness.

01:54:22.110 --> 01:54:23.860
LAURA: It smells like fart?

01:54:23.860 --> 01:54:34.550
MATT: It's metallic, iron-like. Sharp, acrid,
uninviting. As you step inside and your hand

01:54:34.550 --> 01:54:43.510
touches the inside of the entranceway, Keyleth,
as soon as your fingers make contact with the

01:54:43.510 --> 01:54:47.980
slick wood, there's an image that flashes in your
head.

01:54:47.980 --> 01:54:49.160
LAURA: Oh, god.

01:54:49.160 --> 01:54:51.390
SAM: The whispers, the whispers.

01:54:51.390 --> 01:54:53.550
LAURA: Oh no.

01:54:53.550 --> 01:54:54.610
SAM: Oh my gosh.

01:54:54.610 --> 01:54:57.960
LAURA: Don't hit that.

01:54:57.960 --> 01:54:59.260
MARISHA: Watch the--

01:54:59.260 --> 01:55:00.670
LAURA: That would be so bad.

01:55:00.670 --> 01:55:02.050
SAM: Oh boy.

01:55:02.050 --> 01:55:03.850
LAURA: I'm gonna smack his ass right now. Whack!

01:55:03.850 --> 01:55:06.460
SAM: Ordinarily I would plug Lootcrate right here,
but this is too tense.

01:55:06.460 --> 01:55:07.600
MARISHA: Wait wait wait.

01:55:07.600 --> 01:55:10.710
TALIESIN: Way too tense to talk about all the
great things Lootcrate will send you every month.

01:55:10.710 --> 01:55:14.630
SAM: Way too tense, yeah, I'm too nervous to
remember the three-dollar-a-month discount that

01:55:14.630 --> 01:55:16.180
you would get by signing up--

01:55:16.180 --> 01:55:18.990
TRAVIS: That's Lootcrate.com/crates.

01:55:18.990 --> 01:55:21.870
LAURA: No, it's /criticalrole. And it'll take you
to crates.

01:55:21.870 --> 01:55:29.650
TALIESIN: Crates will just show you everything
they have.

01:55:29.650 --> 01:55:31.240
MARISHA: We're not alone.

01:55:31.240 --> 01:55:32.470
SAM: What do you mean?

01:55:32.470 --> 01:55:33.420
LAURA: What do you mean?

01:55:33.420 --> 01:55:35.250
SAM: There's creatures?

01:55:35.250 --> 01:55:36.710
MARISHA: He's watching us.

01:55:36.710 --> 01:55:38.050
SAM: Who?

01:55:38.050 --> 01:55:39.490
LAURA: Sondur.

01:55:39.490 --> 01:55:45.160
MATT: As you're saying this, your hand's following
the side, and it opens up again. You only have

01:55:45.160 --> 01:55:52.390
about five feet of walking before this tiny tunnel
opens up into an interior chamber.

01:55:52.390 --> 01:55:56.660
TRAVIS: Well, I hope he's watching. We just
crawled in his tree anus.

01:55:56.660 --> 01:55:58.040
MATT: His tranus?

01:55:58.040 --> 01:55:59.470
(All laugh.)

01:55:59.470 --> 01:56:04.000
SAM: Ah, Matt.

01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:09.230
LIAM: Bad DM.

01:56:09.230 --> 01:56:15.490
MARISHA: Sondur. Is this you leading us straight
to you?

01:56:15.490 --> 01:56:19.590
MATT: Nothing.

01:56:19.590 --> 01:56:21.590
TRAVIS: How about we hit the wall?

01:56:21.590 --> 01:56:24.090
LAURA: No! We're trapped in the tree.

01:56:24.090 --> 01:56:31.230
SAM: I will, I'll try one more time and just say,
Sondur, we are... Sondurites, here to pay homage

01:56:31.230 --> 01:56:37.910
to you. Please, show yourself and make us feel
your presence.

01:56:37.910 --> 01:56:39.890
MATT: Are you guys still entering, or have you
stopped?

01:56:39.890 --> 01:56:41.990
LAURA: (sings) Oh, Sondur... (stops singing) We're
walking forward, we're walking forward.

01:56:41.990 --> 01:56:43.370
MATT: Because some of you are still outside of the
tree.

01:56:43.370 --> 01:56:44.140
TALIESIN: Still going in.

01:56:44.140 --> 01:56:45.990
MATT: Okay. So you all eventually make your way
inside this space.

01:56:45.990 --> 01:56:49.530
MARISHA: I look at Scanlan and wipe the tree-dick
off my forehead.

01:56:49.530 --> 01:56:51.070
MATT: Okay, it's pitch-black in here, by the way.

01:56:51.070 --> 01:56:52.350
SAM: (whispering) It's our sign!

01:56:52.350 --> 01:56:57.260
MATT: Percy, you see nothing. The rest of you have
some semblance of dark-vision here, so you can

01:56:57.260 --> 01:57:08.290
see, the interior here, it is wall-to-wall vines
and thick, heavy roots. You are definitely on the

01:57:08.290 --> 01:57:16.410
inside of the tree, this portion of the giant
hollow chamber. You can see it kind of lifts up.

01:57:16.410 --> 01:57:22.530
Entangled webs of these branches and
smaller, long-dead trees jutting out inside,

01:57:22.530 --> 01:57:28.320
like actual smaller physical trees within the
large tree. As you all enter, the little bit of

01:57:28.320 --> 01:57:34.110
light behind you, Grog? Begins to shrink,
and you look over your shoulder as the entrance

01:57:34.110 --> 01:57:38.660
you came through slams closed and you are all left
in darkness.

01:57:38.660 --> 01:57:40.130
LAURA: We're just stuck in a tree now.

01:57:40.130 --> 01:57:42.230
TRAVIS: Well, he puckered up.

01:57:42.230 --> 01:57:49.770
MATT: The smell gets stronger and stronger.
At that point, as Grog, you kind of pull your way

01:57:49.770 --> 01:57:53.910
through, and you're all standing
shoulder-to-shoulder in this dark space,

01:57:53.910 --> 01:57:59.640
this one singular tree root that's sticking up
from the center in two different places.

01:57:59.640 --> 01:58:06.680
This thin, reedy voice begins to echo through,
sourceless around you, that says,

01:58:06.680 --> 01:58:17.150
"I know you. The moment you touched my
sickness, I knew you."

01:58:17.150 --> 01:58:23.160
At this moment, small patches of fungal clusters

01:58:23.160 --> 01:58:30.260
begin to illuminate in the room. Areas of the
vines and ground just spring to life, and this

01:58:30.260 --> 01:58:37.350
dull blue glow begins to fill the room with very,
very low light. You can just make out shapes.

01:58:37.350 --> 01:58:41.840
You can see that the vines are just very slowly
shifting around you. The walls are not still.

01:58:41.900 --> 01:58:45.700
That little bit of movement you'd occasionally
catch on the outside of the tree, it is perpetual

01:58:45.790 --> 01:58:53.390
inside here. It is this constant churning mass of
living tree. You look up, and you can see all the

01:58:53.390 --> 01:58:59.160
branches come and mat together into this conical
ceiling, where a number of vines drip down and

01:58:59.160 --> 01:59:08.250
just hang, hundreds of them. You see the vines are
slowly coalescing in the center of this upward

01:59:08.250 --> 01:59:16.270
kind of pinnacle. Slithering one into the next
like a thousand slithering snakes.

01:59:16.270 --> 01:59:18.160
A voice comes out again.

01:59:18.160 --> 01:59:22.460
"Why do you come here, children of the
lost?

01:59:22.460 --> 01:59:30.480
What purpose brings you to Sondur's madness and pain?"

01:59:30.480 --> 01:59:34.150
LAURA: We've come to help you.

01:59:34.150 --> 01:59:41.860
MATT: A mass in the ceiling separates ever so
slightly, and you watch as two feet descend from

01:59:41.860 --> 01:59:50.680
this strange apex. You now see the feet are a full
creature, held aloft by connected tendrils of

01:59:50.680 --> 01:59:58.930
black plant matter, emanating from the back and
shoulders, as it slowly descends from the ceiling.

01:59:58.930 --> 02:00:07.770
A thin, elf-like individual, their body comprised
of hundreds of small plants, leaves, and thorns.

02:00:07.770 --> 02:00:12.710
The only semblance of flesh you see across the
face is the nose, the eyes, and the mouth.

02:00:12.710 --> 02:00:19.040
The rest of it just slowly giving way to a
similar nest of plant-like vines that completely

02:00:19.040 --> 02:00:29.320
fill the exterior of this room. It slowly touches
down, its feet hitting the ground, and as it does,

02:00:29.410 --> 02:00:35.560
the tendrils all detach and withdraw back into
the ceiling, leaving it there, arms to its side,

02:00:35.560 --> 02:00:41.460
its head down. Its face comes up, its eyes
immediately open with this bright yellow glow that

02:00:41.460 --> 02:00:48.250
kind of bathes you. You can see the form,
the edges of all of your allies now, even being

02:00:48.250 --> 02:00:51.940
framed by this light that's just pouring forth
from its face.

02:00:51.940 --> 02:00:54.240
LAURA: I bow.

02:00:54.240 --> 02:00:56.540
LIAM: Follow suit.

02:00:56.540 --> 02:00:58.970
SAM: Sure, I'll bow as well.

02:00:58.970 --> 02:01:05.740
MATT: You all bow before this creature. Do you
bow? All right.

02:01:05.740 --> 02:01:07.120
MARISHA: I stand as well.

02:01:07.120 --> 02:01:08.680
MATT: All right.

02:01:08.680 --> 02:01:16.590
"You all come here, but one of
you is the reason."

02:01:16.590 --> 02:01:24.040
It looks straight towards you. The light focuses
and narrows from his eyes.

02:01:24.040 --> 02:01:44.290
"You. Sweet, broken Vex'ahlia. Unwanted daughter,
unproven ally. Selfish and cruel. You drive those

02:01:44.290 --> 02:01:56.500
"whom you would call family into danger and death
for your own gain. I understand you."

02:01:56.500 --> 02:02:03.140
There's a softness and sadness to the face as
he takes one step in your direction.

02:02:03.140 --> 02:02:12.750
"You are lost without
form. Without knowing who you are, child.

02:02:12.750 --> 02:02:17.010
"You stand shattered by expectation.

02:02:17.010 --> 02:02:26.420
"Presenting an illusion of confidence.
Behind it, you never left that bloodied girl,

02:02:26.420 --> 02:02:39.660
"dagger in hand, body at your feet. You are a
killer, run as you may. The tears you cry are not

02:02:39.660 --> 02:02:54.220
"in vain, my sweet, my dear Vex'ahlia. You can rise
above your trembling destiny. I have lived a

02:02:54.220 --> 02:03:12.720
"thousand years and a day. I have seen many things.
I can grant many gifts."

02:03:12.720 --> 02:03:15.280
LAURA: Are we still pretending to like this fuck?

02:03:15.280 --> 02:03:16.490
SAM: Nope.

02:03:16.490 --> 02:03:26.800
LAURA: I don't want anything you offer.

02:03:26.800 --> 02:03:40.000
MATT: "You mistake. My intent is not to hurt,
but to understand. I see lots of my youth in you.

02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:52.840
"We are not as different as you may think.
You have things I do not. Companionship.

02:03:52.840 --> 02:04:10.030
"I have been without for so very long. And the
ones I have let in have hurt me so very deeply."

02:04:10.030 --> 02:04:14.660
His eyes actually cast away from you for a
second and he steps back into place. Almost seems

02:04:14.660 --> 02:04:23.160
to, his confident form withdraws into this almost
hanging, sad position.

02:04:23.160 --> 02:04:27.400
LAURA: You've been betrayed.

02:04:27.400 --> 02:04:30.310
MATT: We all have in some degree, yes.

02:04:30.310 --> 02:04:34.260
LAURA: Is that why you are what you are now?

02:04:34.260 --> 02:04:42.540
MATT: I don't even remember. I just know that I'm
alone and she left me there.

02:04:42.540 --> 02:04:47.440
LAURA: She? Who is she?

02:04:47.440 --> 02:05:05.860
MATT: Memories have faded. I just want someone to
understand me, that's all. Can you understand me?

02:05:05.860 --> 02:05:19.620
LAURA: Sondur. I understand.

02:05:19.620 --> 02:05:27.780
MATT: "Is there trust in you?"

02:05:27.780 --> 02:05:35.530
His form steps forward once more, his head tilted,
looking at you curiously.

02:05:35.530 --> 02:05:38.450
LAURA: You want to be loved.

02:05:38.450 --> 02:05:57.070
MATT: I wish a bond. A companion once more.
Would you embrace me? Embrace your rebirth?

02:05:57.070 --> 02:06:03.020
I could give you so much.

02:06:03.020 --> 02:06:12.130
LIAM: Vex'ahlia.

02:06:12.130 --> 02:06:19.610
MATT: I could give you the means to protect them.
Your home.

02:06:19.610 --> 02:06:24.910
LAURA: What would you ask in return?

02:06:24.910 --> 02:06:30.080
MATT: Your heart.

02:06:30.080 --> 02:06:36.160
LAURA: My heart is someone else's. And I pull my
bow.

02:06:36.160 --> 02:06:43.280
MATT: He withdraws a moment. The tendrils whip out
again and connect into his back,

02:06:43.280 --> 02:06:47.810
and he's pulled aloft, back, further in.

02:06:47.810 --> 02:07:01.080
"All I ask is one who
knows my pain. What is your answer?"

02:07:01.080 --> 02:07:03.530
LAURA: I release the arrow.

02:07:03.530 --> 02:07:06.290
MATT: Roll an attack.

02:07:06.290 --> 02:07:08.870
LAURA: I'm sorry, I feel so guilty about it!

02:07:08.870 --> 02:07:10.490
MATT: Roll an attack.

02:07:10.490 --> 02:07:14.020
SAM: He just wanted a kiss and you shot him!

02:07:14.020 --> 02:07:15.590
MARISHA: He's a dick.

02:07:15.590 --> 02:07:16.950
LAURA: 25.

02:07:16.950 --> 02:07:22.820
MATT: All right. Go ahead and roll damage.

02:07:22.820 --> 02:07:25.620
SAM: Just a lonely guy.

02:07:25.620 --> 02:07:27.590
LAURA: 16.

02:07:27.590 --> 02:07:29.110
TALIESIN: I have no respect for anyone who says
we're not so different.

02:07:29.110 --> 02:07:31.660
MATT: 16 points of piercing damage.

02:07:31.660 --> 02:07:35.170
LIAM: And shitting black diarrhea out of the
tree.

02:07:35.170 --> 02:07:42.240
MATT: As the arrow hits his form as he's being
pulled up-- (gasps)-- you hear the air escape like

02:07:42.240 --> 02:07:50.070
he had the wind knocked out of him. His glowing
yellow eyes blink, blink, and his jaw kind of

02:07:50.070 --> 02:08:01.620
hangs open. There in the low-lit darkness.
And you watch as more of that black, thick tar

02:08:01.620 --> 02:08:08.240
just begins to pour from his mouth onto the
ground, splattering and seeping into the floor.

02:08:08.240 --> 02:08:12.110
His jaw slowly closes.

02:08:12.110 --> 02:08:16.920
"Then I am to be alone."

02:08:16.920 --> 02:08:18.600
He reaches his hand up, and you watch--

02:08:18.600 --> 02:08:19.650
MARISHA: Oh shit!

02:08:19.650 --> 02:08:28.970
MATT: -- as these vines reveal and give to him
this large curved bow that he grasps in his hand.

02:08:28.970 --> 02:08:34.170
The other vines curl around his body, and you can
see his form begin to build, like his actual body

02:08:34.170 --> 02:08:40.260
begins to grow as the vines become part of him.
His face of flesh disappears behind an exterior

02:08:40.260 --> 02:08:46.700
of dark and gnarled wood. The voice grows deep as
he all of a sudden withdraws into the side of the

02:08:46.700 --> 02:08:54.670
tree itself, and then bursts forth, landing on the
ground. Not an elf-like entity, but some sort of

02:08:54.670 --> 02:09:00.220
gnarled root-like tree creature, holding Fenthras
in one hand.

02:09:00.220 --> 02:09:02.150
LAURA: Was that bad? Should I have not attacked
him?

02:09:02.150 --> 02:09:03.150
SAM: You did great.

02:09:03.150 --> 02:09:03.940
LAURA: Okay.

02:09:03.940 --> 02:09:05.240
TALIESIN: No, no, he was being terrible.

02:09:05.240 --> 02:09:06.170
LAURA: We should probably--

02:09:06.170 --> 02:09:08.240
MATT: Your choice is made.

02:09:08.240 --> 02:09:09.040
LAURA: I call out Trinket--

02:09:09.040 --> 02:09:14.420
MATT: Become another memory here and keep me
company in oblivion.

02:09:14.420 --> 02:09:18.500
SAM: Oh, god.

02:09:18.500 --> 02:09:22.560
MATT: The two dead trees quake and begin to lift
up--

02:09:22.560 --> 02:09:23.520
MARISHA: Oh, fuck.

02:09:23.520 --> 02:09:25.730
MATT: -- from the sides of the tree. Everyone roll
initiative.

02:09:25.730 --> 02:09:27.830
TALIESIN: Oh.

02:09:27.830 --> 02:09:29.240
TRAVIS: Yeah!

02:09:29.240 --> 02:09:30.840
LAURA: I feel so guilty.

02:09:30.840 --> 02:09:32.180
MARISHA: No, he was a fucking cock.

02:09:32.180 --> 02:09:33.520
LAURA: He was terrible, was it mean?

02:09:33.520 --> 02:09:35.230
MARISHA: No, dude.

02:09:35.230 --> 02:09:37.480
LAURA: Okay, we're in the tree, we're in the
tree.

02:09:37.480 --> 02:09:39.590
MARISHA: Like you said, I don't trust anyone who
says we're alike, you and I.

02:09:39.590 --> 02:09:42.140
SAM: What, were you gonna give him a hug and get
possessed forever?

02:09:42.140 --> 02:09:44.010
LAURA: I know, he's offering terrible things,
right?

02:09:44.010 --> 02:09:45.390
TALIESIN: He was a dick.

02:09:45.390 --> 02:09:47.380
MARISHA: I also don't like anyone who tries to act
like

02:09:47.380 --> 02:09:50.000
we didn't make our own choice to come in here.

02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:52.860
TALIESIN: And for that matter, anybody who says
we're not so different,

02:09:52.860 --> 02:09:54.850
that's usually a sign of a terrible person.

02:09:54.850 --> 02:09:55.950
MARISHA: That we're totally different.

02:09:55.950 --> 02:09:57.100
TALIESIN: Terrible person.

02:09:57.100 --> 02:09:58.630
SAM: Because we're terrible people.

02:09:58.630 --> 02:10:00.190
TALIESIN: Well, that's very fair.

02:10:00.190 --> 02:10:01.680
LIAM: He's creeping on my sister, fuck him.

02:10:01.680 --> 02:10:03.850
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:10:03.850 --> 02:10:09.460
TALIESIN: I was only not shooting him to be
polite.

02:10:09.460 --> 02:10:11.200
TRAVIS: Oh, shit.

02:10:11.200 --> 02:10:16.940
MATT: All right, so. 25 to 20, anybody?

02:10:16.940 --> 02:10:18.180
TALIESIN: 21.

02:10:18.180 --> 02:10:19.320
MATT: 21.

02:10:19.320 --> 02:10:20.820
LIAM: 23.

02:10:20.820 --> 02:10:24.230
MATT: Nice.

02:10:24.230 --> 02:10:27.170
TRAVIS: Just so you know, your notepad is in the
upper-left.

02:10:27.170 --> 02:10:28.700
LIAM: Secrets.

02:10:28.700 --> 02:10:30.740
LAURA: (laughs) Scootch-scootch.

02:10:30.740 --> 02:10:36.090
MATT: All right, and so. Vax, Percy, 21, er,
20 to 15?

02:10:36.090 --> 02:10:37.120
TRAVIS: 18.

02:10:37.120 --> 02:10:38.100
MARISHA: 15.

02:10:38.100 --> 02:10:39.020
SAM: 15.

02:10:39.020 --> 02:10:40.780
MATT: All righty.

02:10:40.780 --> 02:10:54.910
LAURA: I got that one hit and that was all I got.
I'm sorry.

02:10:54.910 --> 02:10:58.110
MATT: All right, and then...

02:10:58.110 --> 02:10:59.290
LAURA: 14.

02:10:59.290 --> 02:11:14.990
MATT: 14? Okay. All righty. So, top of the round,
Vax. You have first up.

02:11:14.990 --> 02:11:17.050
You're currently over here.

02:11:17.050 --> 02:11:20.560
LIAM: Yeah. I can see fuck-all through this
magical window--

02:11:20.560 --> 02:11:21.820
MATT: I understand.

02:11:21.820 --> 02:11:25.960
LIAM: So I see where I am in that circle,
what are the big clumps of poop in the middle?

02:11:25.960 --> 02:11:30.590
MATT: This right here is part of the root that is
growing up in the center of this tree. There are

02:11:30.590 --> 02:11:36.180
two trees on the side that are shifting,
and the actual large dark-rooted form that is now

02:11:36.180 --> 02:11:39.450
Sondur is over here on the far side.

02:11:39.450 --> 02:11:46.420
LIAM: All right, boots click, uh, I am hanging
back behind-- is Trinket out still?

02:11:46.420 --> 02:11:49.150
LAURA: He's out. Oh. I haven't brought him out
yet, I haven't brought him out.

02:11:49.150 --> 02:11:50.130
MATT: No.

02:11:50.130 --> 02:11:52.430
LIAM: All right. Then I'm just leaning out from
behind Grog

02:11:52.430 --> 02:11:55.560
and I am going to dagger-dagger-dagger him.

02:11:55.560 --> 02:11:57.130
MATT: All righty, go for it.

02:11:57.130 --> 02:11:59.550
LIAM: And I'm first to attack so I have
advantage.

02:11:59.550 --> 02:12:01.500
MATT: You do.

02:12:01.500 --> 02:12:03.710
LIAM: Okay, so the first hit is a 26.

02:12:03.710 --> 02:12:06.110
MATT: 26 hits.

02:12:06.110 --> 02:12:08.340
LIAM: Yeah, second is a 26.

02:12:08.340 --> 02:12:09.860
MATT: Hits.

02:12:09.860 --> 02:12:12.970
LIAM: And the third is a 21.

02:12:12.970 --> 02:12:14.940
MATT: 21. All three hit.

02:12:14.940 --> 02:12:16.850
LIAM: Okay, so the first one is sneak attack.

02:12:16.850 --> 02:12:17.900
MATT: It is.

02:12:17.900 --> 02:12:25.610
LIAM: This one is the flame-tongue, here it goes.
Six and seven,

02:12:25.610 --> 02:12:27.770
here comes the sneak attack damage.

02:12:27.770 --> 02:12:29.440
MATT: All the sneak attack damage!

02:12:29.440 --> 02:12:30.560
LIAM: Say again?

02:12:30.560 --> 02:12:33.010
MATT: Percy, you're up next, just so you're
aware.

02:12:33.010 --> 02:12:39.740
LIAM: (mumbling) 30 for the first.

02:12:39.740 --> 02:12:41.950
MATT: 30, nice.

02:12:41.950 --> 02:12:50.930
LIAM: Seven for the second, and eight for the third.

02:12:51.140 --> 02:12:55.980
MATT: Great, all right. You, tapping the boots,
rush out behind Grog, fling all three daggers,

02:12:55.980 --> 02:13:04.550
all seem to stick into the wood-armored exterior
of Sondur's treant form. You see he kind of pulls

02:13:04.550 --> 02:13:09.930
back a bit from the impact. Damage definitely has
been sustained unexpectedly.

02:13:09.930 --> 02:13:12.350
LIAM: Where am I in relation to the party,
to my sister?

02:13:12.350 --> 02:13:17.100
MATT: You're right there, your sister is right
there. So you're about 10 feet from her.

02:13:17.100 --> 02:13:20.600
LIAM: I'm gonna just roll forward and crouch in
front of her low,

02:13:20.600 --> 02:13:22.930
to give her a shot but be in
front of her.

02:13:22.930 --> 02:13:26.160
MATT: All righty. There you go. All right,
that finishes your turn.

02:13:26.160 --> 02:13:28.340
That brings us to Percy.

02:13:28.340 --> 02:13:36.270
TALIESIN: I'm going to dart to the right and keep
about 10 to 15 feet distance away from the

02:13:36.270 --> 02:13:39.850
exterior wall, because that looks creepy as fuck.

02:13:39.850 --> 02:13:40.910
MATT: Okay.

02:13:40.910 --> 02:13:44.480
TALIESIN: About there. First thing I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna pull out Bad News and I'm gonna take a

02:13:44.480 --> 02:13:47.060
shot, and I'm gonna try and disarm him.

02:13:47.060 --> 02:13:48.940
MATT: Okay.

02:13:48.940 --> 02:13:54.390
TALIESIN: So. We'll see if that does anything.

02:13:54.390 --> 02:13:55.730
Natural 20.

02:13:55.730 --> 02:13:57.660
LAURA: Yes!

02:13:57.660 --> 02:14:01.330
SAM: At least five a session.

02:14:01.330 --> 02:14:03.620
LIAM: That loaded die was the best investment we
ever made.

02:14:03.620 --> 02:14:07.000
TALIESIN: It was the best, it was such a
wonderful, wonderful--

02:14:07.000 --> 02:14:08.560
SAM: Did a fan give that to you?

02:14:08.560 --> 02:14:10.280
TALIESIN: A fan gave that to me, yes they did.

02:14:10.280 --> 02:14:11.550
MATT: All right, natural 20.

02:14:11.550 --> 02:14:18.080
TALIESIN: Natural 20, and that means I don't even
burn the grit for it, and that's arm-shot, so.

02:14:18.080 --> 02:14:22.200
Strength saving throw against a DC 19.

02:14:22.200 --> 02:14:25.990
MATT: That is 21, so yeah, it manages to maintain
it.

02:14:25.990 --> 02:14:34.320
TALIESIN: Okay, so it maintains it. I forgot to
cast Hex, but god damn it. That's fine.

02:14:34.320 --> 02:14:38.140
So, taking my shot...

02:14:38.140 --> 02:14:39.840
MATT: Dice times two.

02:14:39.840 --> 02:14:45.750
TALIESIN: That went well. That's 19 times two,
that's 38.

02:14:45.750 --> 02:14:47.800
MATT: 38 points of damage.

02:14:47.800 --> 02:14:49.680
TALIESIN: That's 44 points of damage.

02:14:49.680 --> 02:14:51.750
MATT: 44 points of damage on the critical hit.

02:14:51.750 --> 02:14:55.950
TALIESIN: Of piercing damage. I'm gonna reload.

02:14:55.950 --> 02:14:57.080
MATT: All right.

02:14:57.080 --> 02:14:59.250
TALIESIN: I'm gonna cast Hex.

02:14:59.250 --> 02:15:03.110
MATT: The impact manages to hit part of the wood,
it splinters,

02:15:03.110 --> 02:15:08.910
not doing as much damage as you'd
expect it would.

02:15:08.910 --> 02:15:10.650
TALIESIN: That's fine.

02:15:10.650 --> 02:15:14.040
MATT: It's still a nice hit, but the form seemed
to resist it--

02:15:14.040 --> 02:15:18.330
TALIESIN: Seems to be taking it. That's fine.
I'm casting Hex.

02:15:18.330 --> 02:15:19.450
MATT: All right.

02:15:19.450 --> 02:15:26.720
TALIESIN: I'm giving him disadvantage on strength
saving throws.

02:15:26.720 --> 02:15:28.380
MATT: All righty.

02:15:28.380 --> 02:15:29.420
TALIESIN: I'm gonna take another shot--

02:15:29.420 --> 02:15:31.090
MATT: Ability checks, not saving throws.

02:15:31.090 --> 02:15:34.490
TALIESIN: Yeah, checks, excuse me. I'm gonna take
another shot at getting that damn bow out of his

02:15:34.490 --> 02:15:49.230
hand. So we'll see if we can do that. Yeah,
that's a 19, so that's 32 to hit.

02:15:49.230 --> 02:15:51.810
MATT: That hits.

02:15:51.810 --> 02:15:54.850
TALIESIN: He can roll his saving throw.

02:15:54.850 --> 02:15:59.020
MATT: 17, so no.

02:15:59.020 --> 02:16:00.540
TALIESIN: So no, he drops the bow.

02:16:00.540 --> 02:16:01.890
MATT: The bow gets dropped.

02:16:01.890 --> 02:16:02.820
SAM: Oh, shit!

02:16:02.820 --> 02:16:03.920
TALIESIN: Bow's on the ground.

02:16:03.920 --> 02:16:08.220
MARISHA: Oh, bow's on the ground, bow's on the
ground.

02:16:08.220 --> 02:16:15.460
TALIESIN: That's a terrible roll. That's okay.
So that's ten points of piercing damage and two

02:16:15.460 --> 02:16:17.620
points of necrotic damage.

02:16:17.620 --> 02:16:19.440
MATT: Okay.

02:16:19.440 --> 02:16:21.360
SAM: How do you want to do this?

02:16:21.360 --> 02:16:26.550
MATT: So you fire the second shot, does hit,
a little crack of impact, the wood on the

02:16:26.550 --> 02:16:31.770
exterior splinters a bit, the necrotic hit does
still push through. All right, that finishes your

02:16:31.770 --> 02:16:36.130
turn, as Fenthras gets blasted off, a finger's
actually missing from the impact.

02:16:36.130 --> 02:16:38.440
A finger begins to grow back.

02:16:38.440 --> 02:16:40.330
TALIESIN: Bow's on the ground!

02:16:40.330 --> 02:16:44.250
MATT: All right, Grog. Actually, no, before you're
up, we're at count 20. All right.

02:16:44.250 --> 02:16:45.620
SAM: Count 20.

02:16:45.620 --> 02:16:46.830
LAURA: What's that mean?

02:16:46.830 --> 02:16:48.290
MARISHA: What does that mean?

02:16:48.290 --> 02:16:50.730
MATT: So. Suddenly the ground quakes for a second,
part of the roots expand--

02:16:50.730 --> 02:16:52.620
TALIESIN: Oh, shit.

02:16:52.620 --> 02:16:53.450
SAM: Lair actions.

02:16:53.450 --> 02:16:58.730
MATT: -- and a cloud of gas begins to fill a small
area about that big.

02:16:58.730 --> 02:17:00.260
LAURA: Oh, of course.

02:17:00.260 --> 02:17:05.450
MATT: I need Scanlan, Keyleth, Vax, and Vex to
make a constitution saving throw.

02:17:05.450 --> 02:17:06.950
MARISHA: Where's that dice?

02:17:06.950 --> 02:17:08.520
LIAM: Oh, that's our specialty.

02:17:08.520 --> 02:17:10.010
MARISHA: Yeah, right? Not bad.

02:17:10.010 --> 02:17:11.550
LAURA: Oh, natural 20!

02:17:11.550 --> 02:17:12.740
MATT: Nice.

02:17:12.740 --> 02:17:15.340
LIAM: I'm gonna burn a Luck. 16.

02:17:15.340 --> 02:17:16.750
MATT: All right.

02:17:16.750 --> 02:17:18.310
MARISHA: 20 total, 20 total.

02:17:18.310 --> 02:17:20.090
SAM: 20 total.

02:17:20.090 --> 02:17:22.380
MATT: Okay.

02:17:22.380 --> 02:17:23.930
(All laugh.)

02:17:23.930 --> 02:17:25.120
MATT: All of you guys manage to just in time--

02:17:25.120 --> 02:17:26.180
TRAVIS: He's pissed.

02:17:26.180 --> 02:17:30.660
MATT: -- catch your breath and keep below the
poison cloud as it dissipates in the vicinity of

02:17:30.660 --> 02:17:40.790
you, so you reduce the damage to each of you guys
to be

02:17:40.790 --> 02:17:43.310
12 points of poison damage to all of you guys.

02:17:43.310 --> 02:17:48.250
MARISHA: Damn. That's half.

02:17:48.250 --> 02:17:52.520
MATT: So that's 12 points of poison damage to each
one of you guys. Now, Grog, it's your turn.

02:17:52.520 --> 02:17:56.050
TRAVIS: I would like to advance-- I would like to
rage.

02:17:56.050 --> 02:17:57.410
MATT: All right.

02:17:57.410 --> 02:18:05.760
TRAVIS: I would like to advance as far as I can
get towards the treant.

02:18:05.760 --> 02:18:08.180
MATT: You can get right there, you're not quite
close enough to hit.

02:18:08.180 --> 02:18:12.920
TRAVIS: Hey, that's cool, and I'm gonna use the
chain of returning with the blood axe, and I'm

02:18:12.920 --> 02:18:14.940
gonna throw it at the tree.

02:18:14.940 --> 02:18:16.030
MATT: All right.

02:18:16.030 --> 02:18:18.130
TRAVIS: At Sondur.

02:18:18.130 --> 02:18:22.980
MATT: Go for it.

02:18:22.980 --> 02:18:27.580
TRAVIS: That's not great. Oh! 20 total.

02:18:27.580 --> 02:18:29.640
MATT: 20 total? All righty.

02:18:29.640 --> 02:18:31.870
(background music becomes distorted)

02:18:31.870 --> 02:18:34.110
LAURA: Oh no. We gotta get a new cable, a new
cable for you.

02:18:34.110 --> 02:18:35.380
SAM: It's dying.

02:18:35.380 --> 02:18:37.320
MATT: I know, I have a new iPad coming, actually.

02:18:37.320 --> 02:18:38.220
LAURA: Oh, okay.

02:18:38.220 --> 02:18:40.690
MATT: It's in the budget, having issues,
strangely. Which is a shame, because this works

02:18:40.690 --> 02:18:43.160
really well for this battle. I dunno. Maybe.

02:18:43.160 --> 02:18:44.500
SAM: Music help!

02:18:44.500 --> 02:18:45.640
MATT: I'll try.

02:18:45.640 --> 02:18:47.590
MARISHA: Oh, that got so awkwardly quiet.

02:18:47.590 --> 02:18:49.780
LAURA: Oh no, it's all...

02:18:49.780 --> 02:18:52.100
MATT: Yeah, I don't wanna tear it. Whatever,
it's fine, it's fine.

02:18:52.100 --> 02:18:55.000
MARISHA: It just sounds weird inside the tree...

02:18:55.000 --> 02:18:56.050
TALIESIN: Acoustics.

02:18:56.050 --> 02:18:56.900
MARISHA: Acoustics.

02:18:56.900 --> 02:18:59.360
SAM: If anyone works for Apple and wants to send
us all new iPads.

02:18:59.360 --> 02:19:00.640
(All laugh.)

02:19:00.640 --> 02:19:03.830
TALIESIN: iPhones. iPad Pros.

02:19:03.830 --> 02:19:05.500
MARISHA: Preferably in rose gold.

02:19:05.500 --> 02:19:07.510
(The music comes back in, less distorted.)

02:19:07.510 --> 02:19:08.860
SAM: Better? Better!

02:19:08.860 --> 02:19:10.000
LAURA: That sounds better.

02:19:10.000 --> 02:19:11.050
MATT: It's working better.

02:19:11.050 --> 02:19:12.950
MARISHA: Yes, much better. Much better.

02:19:12.950 --> 02:19:13.620
LAURA: Yeah.

02:19:13.620 --> 02:19:14.420
MARISHA: You're good.

02:19:14.420 --> 02:19:15.510
MATT: Okay, cool. We're good.

02:19:15.510 --> 02:19:17.000
SAM: Forget those iPads.

02:19:17.000 --> 02:19:19.010
MATT: So, Grog, what was your attack roll?

02:19:19.010 --> 02:19:20.270
TRAVIS: It was a 20 total.

02:19:20.270 --> 02:19:25.520
MATT: That does just barely hit. Go ahead and roll
damage.

02:19:25.520 --> 02:19:27.970
TRAVIS: 24.

02:19:27.970 --> 02:19:29.050
MATT: 24 points--

02:19:29.050 --> 02:19:33.360
TRAVIS: Ahh, plus... four points of necrotic
damage, for 28.

02:19:33.360 --> 02:19:40.130
MATT: 28 points of damage. The axe, with all your
heaving might behind it, travels the ten feet to

02:19:40.130 --> 02:19:47.600
slam into the chest of Sondur. Reaches up and
tries to grab it, smashing it between his hands to

02:19:47.600 --> 02:19:54.530
hold it there. Go ahead and make your strength to
pull it back.

02:19:54.530 --> 02:19:55.970
TRAVIS: 18.

02:19:55.970 --> 02:19:59.130
MATT: 18, yeah, that works fine, okay.

02:19:59.130 --> 02:20:02.280
MARISHA: It appeared he took damage from the
necrotic?

02:20:02.280 --> 02:20:04.110
MATT: Yeah, he did.

02:20:04.110 --> 02:20:05.920
TRAVIS: On Percy's and mine.

02:20:05.920 --> 02:20:06.820
MATT: Yeah.

02:20:06.820 --> 02:20:08.300
MARISHA: So he can take necrotic damage.

02:20:08.300 --> 02:20:09.230
TALIESIN: Apparently he can.

02:20:09.230 --> 02:20:10.530
LAURA: That's good, that's good.

02:20:10.530 --> 02:20:11.970
MARISHA: Good to know.

02:20:11.970 --> 02:20:14.220
MATT: But not as impacting on the necrotic damage
as much as you'd hoped.

02:20:14.220 --> 02:20:15.100
LAURA: Oh, okay.

02:20:15.100 --> 02:20:16.210
MARISHA: On the necrotic damage.

02:20:16.210 --> 02:20:18.000
TRAVIS: But Liam did, I mean, Vax did something.

02:20:18.000 --> 02:20:19.920
MATT: Yeah, you guys have all done damage to him,
it was just

02:20:19.920 --> 02:20:21.840
generally lesser than you hoped it would be.

02:20:21.840 --> 02:20:23.560
TRAVIS: Yeah, yours was surprisingly good.

02:20:23.560 --> 02:20:24.650
LAURA: Piercing damage...

02:20:24.650 --> 02:20:27.090
MATT: Well, his just, he just sneak attacked.

02:20:27.090 --> 02:20:28.410
TALIESIN: We haven't found a winner.

02:20:28.410 --> 02:20:29.210
LAURA: Okay.

02:20:29.210 --> 02:20:30.040
LIAM: Sneak-attack damage.

02:20:30.040 --> 02:20:32.330
TALIESIN: We haven't found a winner, we've just
been hitting him really god damned hard.

02:20:32.330 --> 02:20:36.120
MATT: But anyway. So you pull the axe back,
grab it from the chain, it's back in your grip,

02:20:36.120 --> 02:20:38.360
you're fine, you're good to go. Does that end
your turn?

02:20:38.360 --> 02:20:39.520
TRAVIS: That does.

02:20:39.520 --> 02:20:42.400
MATT: All right, at the end of your turn,
he's gonna go ahead and burn two legendary

02:20:42.400 --> 02:20:47.140
actions to cast a spell.

02:20:47.140 --> 02:20:52.130
LAURA: Oh no! He's like a dragon!

02:20:52.130 --> 02:20:55.130
MATT: All right. I need-- (laughs)

02:20:55.130 --> 02:20:57.140
LAURA: I should've just gone evil.

02:20:57.140 --> 02:21:03.350
MATT: I need everyone, all of you, to make a
dexterity saving throw.

02:21:03.350 --> 02:21:05.150
SAM: Is he casting a spell?

02:21:05.150 --> 02:21:06.380
MATT: He is, yes.

02:21:06.380 --> 02:21:08.230
SAM: I will attempt to Counterspell it.

02:21:08.230 --> 02:21:13.310
MATT: Okay. All right, go ahead and make your d20
plus six.

02:21:13.310 --> 02:21:15.270
SAM: I'm gonna go at level five.

02:21:15.270 --> 02:21:16.420
MATT: Okay.

02:21:16.420 --> 02:21:19.840
SAM: Level five. What do I, d20 plus six?

02:21:19.840 --> 02:21:23.100
MATT: Correct.

02:21:23.100 --> 02:21:24.150
SAM: 24.

02:21:24.150 --> 02:21:25.110
MATT: 24?

02:21:25.110 --> 02:21:26.060
SAM: Yeah.

02:21:26.060 --> 02:21:26.980
MATT: All right.

02:21:26.980 --> 02:21:27.720
MARISHA: Hell yeah.

02:21:27.720 --> 02:21:31.330
MATT: He goes to create this spell, and suddenly
it fizzles in midair,

02:21:31.330 --> 02:21:33.340
unable to actually take effect.

02:21:33.340 --> 02:21:34.650
(Sam rings a bell.)

02:21:34.650 --> 02:21:35.870
MARISHA: Hell yeah, Scanlan! Hell yeah.

02:21:35.870 --> 02:21:37.340
(All laugh.)

02:21:37.340 --> 02:21:43.640
MATT: All right, so that finishes that. Ending
Grog's turn, the legendary actions return now.

02:21:43.640 --> 02:21:45.170
SAM: Return?

02:21:45.170 --> 02:21:46.140
MATT: Yes.

02:21:46.140 --> 02:21:47.870
SAM: But he's just used them!

02:21:47.870 --> 02:21:53.550
MATT: Yeah, it comes back at the end of his next
round. At the beginning of his round, you watch as

02:21:53.550 --> 02:21:59.090
his form begins to seal up the wounds he had
taken, beginning to heal ever-so-slightly.

02:21:59.090 --> 02:22:01.420
LAURA: It's his turn now.

02:22:01.420 --> 02:22:09.450
MATT: He reaches down and grabs the bow from the
ground, and you watch as he sinks down into the

02:22:09.450 --> 02:22:12.890
ground, roots reaching up and grabbing him,
and he vanishes into the bottom of the tree.

02:22:12.890 --> 02:22:18.270
MARISHA: Whoa. Yeah.

02:22:18.270 --> 02:22:21.020
That makes sense. It's what I would do.

02:22:21.110 --> 02:22:24.910
SAM: He's getting that invisible figurine that he
has.

02:22:24.910 --> 02:22:27.200
MATT: And reemerges--

02:22:27.200 --> 02:22:30.910
SAM: Oh, hi. Hi, friend.

02:22:30.910 --> 02:22:35.070
MATT: -- way up in the top of the tree, out of the
branches up there, his upper torso extends outward

02:22:35.070 --> 02:22:37.090
and he pulls back the bow--

02:22:37.090 --> 02:22:38.140
LAURA: Oh no.

02:22:38.140 --> 02:22:41.420
MATT: -- and begins just unleashing arrows that
are forming out of his hand, these thin

02:22:41.420 --> 02:22:48.490
thorn-like arrows are built out of his viny-like
arm, and he pulls back and releases them as they

02:22:48.770 --> 02:22:54.730
snap as arrows towards you guys. He's going to
make a bramble-shot attack at you, Grog.

02:22:54.730 --> 02:22:57.810
SAM: Bramble-shot. Sounds tasty.

02:22:57.810 --> 02:23:01.430
MATT: That is going to be 21.

02:23:01.430 --> 02:23:02.480
TRAVIS: Hits.

02:23:02.480 --> 02:23:14.060
MATT: That hits. All right. So you take 14 points
of piercing damage, reduced to half, so you take

02:23:14.060 --> 02:23:18.110
seven points, plus four points of lightning
damage.

02:23:18.110 --> 02:23:19.250
TRAVIS: Lightning damage?

02:23:19.250 --> 02:23:20.840
(Computer alert sound.)

02:23:20.840 --> 02:23:22.570
SAM: Hi, hi Liam.

02:23:22.570 --> 02:23:24.890
LIAM: Not my computer.

02:23:24.890 --> 02:23:31.920
MATT: Plus an additional 18 points of piercing
damage.

02:23:31.920 --> 02:23:33.190
TRAVIS: Halved?

02:23:33.190 --> 02:23:34.560
MATT: Halved to nine.

02:23:34.560 --> 02:23:35.560
LAURA: Wow.

02:23:35.560 --> 02:23:40.080
MATT: As the arrow hits you, and then bursts into
a series of jagged, thorny vines that wrap around

02:23:40.080 --> 02:23:42.750
you. I need you to make a strength saving throw.

02:23:42.750 --> 02:23:45.150
TRAVIS: That's pretty awesome.

02:23:45.150 --> 02:23:47.400
TALIESIN: We're gonna set him on fire, we're gonna
hit him with light,

02:23:47.400 --> 02:23:48.850
we're gonna hit him with things.

02:23:48.850 --> 02:23:50.210
MARISHA: I was thinking fire too.

02:23:50.210 --> 02:23:52.290
LAURA: Lightning. Lightning? Has anybody tried
electricity yet?

02:23:52.290 --> 02:23:53.280
TRAVIS: 22.

02:23:53.280 --> 02:23:57.110
MATT: 22. You feel the bramble vines wrap around
you and try to hold you in place, and you just

02:23:57.110 --> 02:23:58.980
angrily burst out of them.

02:23:58.980 --> 02:24:00.250
SAM: Yes!

02:24:00.250 --> 02:24:00.940
LAURA: Yes!

02:24:00.940 --> 02:24:01.620
MARISHA: Fuck yeah!

02:24:01.620 --> 02:24:02.600
MATT: You are not restrained.

02:24:02.600 --> 02:24:04.100
SAM: Yes, for once.

02:24:04.100 --> 02:24:06.400
MARISHA: (laughing) Yeah, you're not grappled.

02:24:06.400 --> 02:24:08.660
MATT: He's gonna go ahead and unleash two more
arrows--

02:24:08.660 --> 02:24:09.700
LAURA: Shit, Jesus.

02:24:09.700 --> 02:24:13.920
MATT: -- this time towards you, as he's kind of
focused now on the--

02:24:13.920 --> 02:24:15.310
LAURA: Both of them at me?

02:24:15.310 --> 02:24:16.720
MATT: Yeah.

02:24:16.720 --> 02:24:18.040
TRAVIS: Rejection's a bitch.

02:24:18.040 --> 02:24:18.930
MARISHA: Yeah, rejection.

02:24:18.930 --> 02:24:20.920
MATT: He's not too happy with being rejected,
it seems.

02:24:20.920 --> 02:24:22.280
MARISHA: He's been alone for too long.

02:24:22.280 --> 02:24:23.910
MATT: The first one is 24 to hit.

02:24:23.910 --> 02:24:24.840
LAURA: That hits.

02:24:24.840 --> 02:24:27.100
MATT: Second is a 25 to hit.

02:24:27.100 --> 02:24:28.080
LAURA: Both hit.

02:24:28.080 --> 02:24:29.480
MATT: All right.

02:24:29.480 --> 02:24:30.740
LAURA: I'm gonna die.

02:24:30.740 --> 02:24:31.710
MATT: So you take--

02:24:31.710 --> 02:24:32.840
MARISHA: No, you're not.

02:24:32.840 --> 02:24:38.410
SAM: Nah, you'll be fine. (whispering) She's dead.
She's dead. She's definitely dead.

02:24:38.410 --> 02:24:46.020
MATT: 13 points of damage with one lightning, and,
that's a lucky roll, eight points of piercing

02:24:46.020 --> 02:24:48.400
damage with one lightning.

02:24:48.400 --> 02:24:49.710
LAURA: Okay.

02:24:49.710 --> 02:24:53.140
MATT: As two additional arrows just wh-whack!
right inside of you, and you look down and can see

02:24:53.140 --> 02:24:58.600
these large, thin stiletto-like wooden forms that
are just

02:24:58.600 --> 02:25:01.150
pierced into your armor and cut into your flesh.

02:25:01.150 --> 02:25:04.200
LAURA: Is that plus one additional lightning
damage, you mean?

02:25:04.200 --> 02:25:04.970
MATT: Yeah.

02:25:04.970 --> 02:25:06.310
LAURA: Okay, so 14 and nine?

02:25:06.310 --> 02:25:12.780
MATT: Right. Yep. That's gonna end Sondur's turn.
The two dead trees that you saw quaking on the

02:25:12.780 --> 02:25:21.150
sides suddenly burst out, the roots becoming legs,
and you watch as two treants emerge from the

02:25:21.150 --> 02:25:22.420
sides of the tree.

02:25:22.420 --> 02:25:24.270
TRAVIS: Oh, I was joking when I said it.

02:25:24.270 --> 02:25:25.860
TALIESIN: You shouldn't have been.

02:25:25.860 --> 02:25:26.740
SAM: Oh my god.

02:25:26.740 --> 02:25:33.230
MATT: Large sort of freed and sentient trees begin
stomping forward towards you guys. This one is

02:25:33.230 --> 02:25:41.860
going to go ahead and rush up to you folks,
while this one is gonna go right for Percy,

02:25:41.860 --> 02:25:43.910
which is right in its side there.

02:25:43.910 --> 02:25:45.910
SAM: God, this is a tough one.

02:25:45.910 --> 02:25:47.550
MATT: Two slam attacks against you, Percy.

02:25:47.550 --> 02:25:48.820
MARISHA: Ooh, fuck.

02:25:48.820 --> 02:25:50.730
MATT: That is a 19 to hit.

02:25:50.730 --> 02:25:51.860
TALIESIN: That hits.

02:25:51.860 --> 02:25:53.730
MATT: And a natural 20.

02:25:53.730 --> 02:25:56.850
TALIESIN: That doesn't hit.

02:25:56.850 --> 02:25:58.980
MATT: All right.

02:25:58.980 --> 02:26:00.420
TRAVIS: Natural 20.

02:26:00.420 --> 02:26:11.500
MATT: That sucked. For you. Right, so the first
hit, you take 17 points of bludgeoning damage.

02:26:11.500 --> 02:26:19.810
The second hit, 28 points of bludgeoning damage,
as the giant tree just whack! And as soon as you

02:26:19.810 --> 02:26:23.030
try and get out of the way, the giant fist comes
down and slams you right across the neck and

02:26:23.030 --> 02:26:28.640
shoulders, causing you to take a knee, and you can
feel the muscle pop from some sort of

02:26:28.640 --> 02:26:36.740
overextension. The giant tree now, you can see its
bark contorted in this angry face as it pours more

02:26:36.740 --> 02:26:41.170
of that black oil-like liquid out of the corner of
its mouth. The other one that's rushed up against

02:26:41.170 --> 02:26:45.090
the two of you is going to go ahead and take one
hit against you, Vex, and two hits against you,

02:26:45.090 --> 02:26:50.520
Vax. Sorry, it only gets two slams. One on each.
My apologies.

02:26:50.520 --> 02:26:53.790
One against you, Vex, is going to
be sixteen.

02:26:53.790 --> 02:26:54.870
LAURA: Oh, it misses.

02:26:54.870 --> 02:26:56.020
SAM: Hey!

02:26:56.020 --> 02:26:59.580
MATT: You duck out of the way and it actually
slams the large root tree to the front of you.

02:26:59.580 --> 02:27:03.280
The other one goes to Vax. That is going to be a
26 to hit.

02:27:03.280 --> 02:27:07.280
LIAM: Oh yeah. Uncanny dodge.

02:27:07.280 --> 02:27:09.530
MATT: Okay, so you take--

02:27:09.530 --> 02:27:13.350
LIAM: Oh, at disadvantage, excuse me, because of
the cloak of displacement.

02:27:13.350 --> 02:27:16.420
MATT: Rolled an 18 on the second one, so it still
hits you.

02:27:16.420 --> 02:27:20.910
So that effect goes away, but you would take
18 points of bludgeoning damage, reduced to nine

02:27:20.910 --> 02:27:28.920
because of your Uncanny Dodge. All right,
that ends their turn. Now it is Scanlan and

02:27:28.920 --> 02:27:31.780
Keyleth's turn. What are you guys doing?

02:27:31.780 --> 02:27:34.060
SAM: Preference?

02:27:34.060 --> 02:27:36.070
MARISHA: I'm gonna go for the ents.

02:27:36.070 --> 02:27:37.560
SAM: I'm gonna go for the big guy.

02:27:37.560 --> 02:27:39.170
MARISHA: All right. So you go first, then.

02:27:39.170 --> 02:27:44.140
SAM: All right. I'm gonna go a couple steps to the
right,

02:27:44.140 --> 02:27:46.360
like split the difference between me and
Percy.

02:27:46.360 --> 02:27:48.250
MATT: All righty.

02:27:48.250 --> 02:27:52.980
SAM: I will cast, I will use the wand of...
well, jeez,

02:27:52.980 --> 02:27:54.790
lightning or fire, lightning or fire.

02:27:54.790 --> 02:27:55.350
MARISHA: Fire.

02:27:55.350 --> 02:27:56.470
LAURA: Try fire.

02:27:56.470 --> 02:27:59.770
SAM: Wand of fireballs, I'll use three charges.

02:27:59.770 --> 02:28:00.960
MARISHA: Fuck yeah.

02:28:00.960 --> 02:28:03.180
SAM: At the big guy upstairs.

02:28:03.180 --> 02:28:03.940
MATT: Up there?

02:28:03.940 --> 02:28:04.450
SAM: Yeah.

02:28:04.450 --> 02:28:05.240
MATT: Okay.

02:28:05.240 --> 02:28:06.370
MARISHA: Pew-pew.

02:28:06.370 --> 02:28:07.790
LAURA: Big guy upstairs. Santa Claus?

02:28:07.790 --> 02:28:10.320
MARISHA: The CEO of this tree.

02:28:10.320 --> 02:28:11.810
MATT: DC of what on the spell?

02:28:11.810 --> 02:28:14.120
SAM: 15.

02:28:14.120 --> 02:28:16.630
MATT: That, yeah, he makes his save with a 19.
So half-damage,

02:28:16.630 --> 02:28:20.420
go ahead and roll that, five charges?

02:28:20.420 --> 02:28:25.170
SAM: I'm going to use three, I get three charges
and then two more is five...

02:28:25.170 --> 02:28:26.300
yeah, five. Yes, five.

02:28:26.300 --> 02:28:27.250
MATT: Yes, so--

02:28:27.250 --> 02:28:28.410
SAM: So it's 10d6.

02:28:28.410 --> 02:28:29.420
MATT: Correct.

02:28:29.420 --> 02:28:43.310
SAM: Okay. Six, eight, 14, 16, 17. 23... 28, 32.
33.

02:28:43.310 --> 02:28:43.970
MATT: 33.

02:28:43.970 --> 02:28:45.100
SAM: Halved.

02:28:45.100 --> 02:28:52.250
MATT: Half that for 15, or 16 actually, sorry.
16 points of fire damage as the Fireball bursts

02:28:52.250 --> 02:28:57.860
up where you can see some of the roots are blown
off and a bit of the upper ceiling collapses and

02:28:57.860 --> 02:28:59.090
hangs for a second.

02:28:59.090 --> 02:29:01.190
LAURA: Did it look like it actually affected him,
the fire?

02:29:01.190 --> 02:29:03.690
MATT: It looked like he took damage from it,
yeah.

02:29:03.690 --> 02:29:04.960
TRAVIS: It didn't catch fire.

02:29:04.960 --> 02:29:08.860
MATT: It didn't seem to catch fire, no. In fact,
the decaying liquid

02:29:08.860 --> 02:29:11.580
it seems to be spewing out of it, it's almost--

02:29:11.580 --> 02:29:12.830
TRAVIS: A natural retardant?

02:29:12.830 --> 02:29:16.770
MATT: Yeah, it's preventing any flame from
catching on the creature in the vicinity as the

02:29:16.770 --> 02:29:23.010
flames slowly go out. The vines begin to reform to
close up the ceiling, and you see Sondur is still

02:29:23.010 --> 02:29:29.300
kind of gliding through the vines and using them
to move along the upper outside of the tree.

02:29:29.300 --> 02:29:31.170
Is that going to be the end of your movement?

02:29:31.170 --> 02:29:36.180
SAM: Yeah, I'll use a bonus action, gah,
do I heal or do I inspire? What's more helpful

02:29:36.180 --> 02:29:41.070
here? I will heal Percy a little bit.

02:29:41.070 --> 02:29:45.900
I can only cast Healing Word at level one
as a bonus action, right?

02:29:45.900 --> 02:29:47.570
MATT: You can cast it at any level you want to as
a bonus action.

02:29:47.570 --> 02:29:48.110
SAM: Oh, okay.

02:29:48.110 --> 02:29:49.670
MATT: Since you didn't actually cast a spell,
you used the wand.

02:29:49.670 --> 02:29:55.040
SAM: Oh, that's true. Okay, well then I'll do it
at, uh, level two.

02:29:55.040 --> 02:29:55.840
TALIESIN: Okay.

02:29:55.840 --> 02:30:01.990
SAM: I don't know what I'm gonna need today.
It's 2d4 plus five.

02:30:01.990 --> 02:30:03.510
TALIESIN: Okay. Do you roll that or do I?

02:30:03.510 --> 02:30:04.470
SAM: I do.

02:30:04.470 --> 02:30:06.220
MATT: Plus six, technically, because your charisma
went up.

02:30:06.220 --> 02:30:13.880
SAM: Ooh! Oh, nice. I will sing to him, let's see
if I can do this. "Come on, come on, get your

02:30:13.880 --> 02:30:20.410
Scanlan on, it's Thursday night and it won't be
long, gonna play my flute, play my shawm,

02:30:20.410 --> 02:30:26.300
it's Thursday night and it won't be long 'til I
get your health up, get your health up, I got all

02:30:26.300 --> 02:30:32.360
you need, no I don't shoot bows, I don't swing
swords, but damn I can sing."

02:30:32.360 --> 02:30:35.550
(All cheer.)

02:30:35.550 --> 02:30:37.480
MATT: You take that god damn inspiration.

02:30:37.480 --> 02:30:39.410
MARISHA: That was really good!

02:30:39.410 --> 02:30:42.210
LIAM: Sang for his supper.

02:30:42.210 --> 02:30:46.840
SAM: 4d4 plus six. Er. Four plus six, ten.
Ten, ugh!

02:30:46.840 --> 02:30:48.340
LAURA: Ten is better than nothing!

02:30:48.340 --> 02:30:49.740
MARISHA: That's pretty good.

02:30:49.740 --> 02:30:53.830
MATT: Ten hit points as the song pushes your
healing at a rapid pace because it's so inspiring.

02:30:53.830 --> 02:30:56.410
All right. Are you staying where you are,
Scanlan?

02:30:56.410 --> 02:30:59.680
SAM: I already moved a little bit, I'm gonna stick
right there, yeah.

02:30:59.680 --> 02:31:03.610
MATT: Yeah, you moved ten feet, so you're gonna
stay there? Okay. Keyleth.

02:31:03.610 --> 02:31:08.400
MARISHA: Okay, so these trees that are moving
appear to be living trees more or less, correct?

02:31:08.400 --> 02:31:10.830
MATT: Appear to be, yeah. From what you can tell.

02:31:10.830 --> 02:31:14.910
MARISHA: I'm gonna cast Tree Stride on myself.

02:31:14.910 --> 02:31:17.180
MATT: Okay.

02:31:17.180 --> 02:31:22.330
MARISHA: And then I'm gonna go into fire elemental
form and flame on.

02:31:22.330 --> 02:31:23.490
TALIESIN: Yeah!

02:31:23.490 --> 02:31:24.820
LAURA: Oh shit, girl!

02:31:24.820 --> 02:31:26.000
SAM: Have you done that before?

02:31:26.000 --> 02:31:28.030
MARISHA: No, and I don't know if it's really gonna
work.

02:31:28.030 --> 02:31:29.790
SAM: You're Johnny Storm?

02:31:29.790 --> 02:31:30.800
LAURA: Flame on!

02:31:30.800 --> 02:31:32.520
MARISHA: Oh, I've been a fire elemental before,
yeah.

02:31:32.520 --> 02:31:35.110
MATT: So you're gonna move next to this tree,
then? Is that what you're gonna do?

02:31:35.110 --> 02:31:37.450
MARISHA: Well, I'm casting Tree Stride.

02:31:37.450 --> 02:31:41.950
MATT: Right, but Tree Stride, you have to,
you have the ability to enter a tree. You must

02:31:41.950 --> 02:31:44.110
use five feet of movement to enter a tree.

02:31:44.110 --> 02:31:47.750
MARISHA: Right. I'm casting Tree Stride because
it's a concentration that lasts a minute.

02:31:47.750 --> 02:31:48.780
MATT: Right.

02:31:48.780 --> 02:31:52.130
MARISHA: And then I'm going to use my bonus action
to flame on.

02:31:52.130 --> 02:31:57.520
MATT: Okay.

02:31:57.520 --> 02:31:59.160
LAURA: This is pretty cool.

02:31:59.160 --> 02:32:02.020
MARISHA: If this works.

02:32:02.020 --> 02:32:05.810
MATT: Where once was Keyleth is now a fire
elemental.

02:32:05.810 --> 02:32:07.620
LAURA: I fell over, I was so impressed.

02:32:07.620 --> 02:32:13.090
MARISHA: All the rage of the fire ashari.
And then I'm going to enter inside that treant

02:32:13.090 --> 02:32:14.980
right in front of me.

02:32:14.980 --> 02:32:16.960
LAURA: She's going to enter inside of it.

02:32:16.960 --> 02:32:23.240
MARISHA: I'm going to very nicely enter it with
its permission and consent.

02:32:23.240 --> 02:32:24.790
MATT: Okay.

02:32:24.790 --> 02:32:31.870
MARISHA: And then I'm going to multi-attack.

02:32:31.870 --> 02:32:37.450
MATT: So you're using this to just stay within the
tree while punching it on fire.

02:32:37.450 --> 02:32:46.600
MARISHA: Well, ideally, because as per the rules
of Tree Stride, I may use, I instantly know the

02:32:46.600 --> 02:32:51.510
location of all other trees of the same kind and
as part of my movement I can pass into

02:32:51.510 --> 02:32:54.300
any other trees of my choice of that same kind.

02:32:54.300 --> 02:32:55.400
MATT: Yep.

02:32:55.400 --> 02:32:57.590
MARISHA: So I'm gonna take this guy on for right
now.

02:32:57.590 --> 02:33:01.060
MATT: Okay, go for it. So, make your attack rolls
against this treant.

02:33:01.060 --> 02:33:02.750
TRAVIS: Interesting, Keyleth.

02:33:02.750 --> 02:33:04.370
TALIESIN: You are doing some crazy shit.

02:33:04.370 --> 02:33:05.580
LAURA: Crazy shit.

02:33:05.580 --> 02:33:06.560
MARISHA: We'll see.

02:33:06.560 --> 02:33:08.150
SAM: We brought a gun to a tree-fight.

02:33:08.150 --> 02:33:11.430
(All laugh.)

02:33:11.430 --> 02:33:18.180
MARISHA: Those are pretty good. The first hit,
sorry, I don't know my... I'm trying to find what

02:33:18.180 --> 02:33:24.570
I add here. Okay. So the first one is going to be
25 to hit.

02:33:24.570 --> 02:33:26.190
MATT: 25 hits, yep.

02:33:26.190 --> 02:33:27.650
MARISHA: And the second one's going to be 16.

02:33:27.650 --> 02:33:28.530
MATT: Just barely hits.

02:33:28.530 --> 02:33:30.390
MARISHA: Fuck yeah.

02:33:30.390 --> 02:33:33.720
LIAM: (Malone voice) They send one of yours to the
Feywild, you send one of theirs to the morgue.

02:33:33.720 --> 02:33:35.840
(All laugh.)

02:33:35.840 --> 02:33:38.300
MATT: Don't forget your additional, because even
if you're a fire elemental you still get your

02:33:38.300 --> 02:33:39.660
additional fire damage.

02:33:39.660 --> 02:33:41.410
MARISHA: Flame hands, which is an additional d6,
correct?

02:33:41.410 --> 02:33:42.460
MATT: Correct.

02:33:42.460 --> 02:33:53.570
MARISHA: So I am rolling 2d6 plus three twice,
so I'll do 4d... or, I'll roll 3d6 twice.

02:33:53.570 --> 02:34:03.030
First one... not bad. Eight plus five is 13,
plus another three, so 16. 16 for the first one.

02:34:03.030 --> 02:34:07.840
MATT: 16 points of fire damage, all right.
All right, the next one?

02:34:07.840 --> 02:34:15.240
MARISHA: The next one is 14.

02:34:15.240 --> 02:34:18.510
MATT: All right.

02:34:18.510 --> 02:34:26.810
MARISHA: And until the creature takes an action to
douse the fire, the target takes-- oh, it also,

02:34:26.810 --> 02:34:35.100
anything that if I move within, it immediately
takes 1d10 damage whenever I move into its space.

02:34:35.100 --> 02:34:39.320
MATT: All right, so go ahead and roll another
d10.

02:34:39.320 --> 02:34:42.500
MARISHA: Nine.

02:34:42.500 --> 02:34:44.950
SAM: Also, if it's a tree it instantly dies.

02:34:44.950 --> 02:34:46.760
LAURA: That's just the rule, that's just what it
says.

02:34:46.760 --> 02:34:49.690
MATT: You notice as you tear into its body with
the Tree Stride to open it up, it looks down

02:34:49.690 --> 02:34:54.130
confused as you pull into it and then just begin
pummeling and scraping the inside of its form.

02:34:54.130 --> 02:35:02.320
As you do so, from the inside, what little bit of
fire retardant-like black liquid was somewhat

02:35:02.320 --> 02:35:07.440
dried or coated on these, not as thick as it was
on Sondur, not only has it caught fire but the

02:35:07.440 --> 02:35:13.090
wood here is very, very ready for kindling,
and it's vulnerable to fire, everything in that

02:35:13.090 --> 02:35:15.280
was doubled, so you just tear into it--

02:35:15.280 --> 02:35:17.150
(All yell.)

02:35:17.150 --> 02:35:20.600
MATT: You just watch as this treant has a flaming
elemental in its stomach just bursting forth in

02:35:20.600 --> 02:35:27.340
gouts of fire. You watch as it begins to crack up
the center and parts of it are just bursting into

02:35:27.340 --> 02:35:29.120
flames and burning at the top.

02:35:29.120 --> 02:35:29.970
LAURA: Holy crap.

02:35:29.970 --> 02:35:31.470
MATT: It's having a bad day right now.

02:35:31.470 --> 02:35:33.350
LAURA: Keyleth. Serious.

02:35:33.350 --> 02:35:35.260
MATT: Is that the end of your turn?

02:35:35.260 --> 02:35:37.050
MARISHA: That I am satisfied with, yes.

02:35:37.050 --> 02:35:40.360
MATT: All right. Ending Keyleth's turn, that
brings us to Vex, you're up.

02:35:40.360 --> 02:35:45.520
LAURA: Okay. I'm gonna step just a little bit away
from that flaming tree.

02:35:45.520 --> 02:35:48.830
MARISHA: Yes. It is now a safety hazard.

02:35:48.830 --> 02:35:50.640
LAURA: To the side, I'm just gonna step to the
side. Yeah.

02:35:50.640 --> 02:35:52.360
MARISHA: Careful for falling limbs.

02:35:52.360 --> 02:35:57.930
LAURA: I'm gonna Hunter's Mark Sondur, damn it.

02:35:57.930 --> 02:36:00.540
MATT: Okay, as you pull back it does get an attack
of opportunity on you.

02:36:00.540 --> 02:36:01.960
LAURA: Aw.

02:36:01.960 --> 02:36:04.100
MATT: That is an 18 plus ten, 28.

02:36:04.100 --> 02:36:06.080
LAURA: Oh, fuck.

02:36:06.080 --> 02:36:07.950
MATT: So you take--

02:36:07.950 --> 02:36:09.210
SAM: A billion.

02:36:09.210 --> 02:36:11.260
MATT: -- 17 points of bludgeoning damage as you
rush back--

02:36:11.260 --> 02:36:12.250
LAURA: Motherfucker.

02:36:12.250 --> 02:36:16.160
MATT: -- and the flaming treant just reaches out
and strikes you across the back of the head,

02:36:16.160 --> 02:36:20.390
almost sending you tumbling to the ground.
Giant dull thud in the back, you can feel the

02:36:20.390 --> 02:36:22.110
headache growing in your skull, but you continue
forward.

02:36:22.110 --> 02:36:28.010
LAURA: Ah! (strained) Fuck you. Okay. I Hunter's
Mark Sandor. Sandor?

02:36:28.010 --> 02:36:29.050
MARISHA: Sondur.

02:36:29.050 --> 02:36:30.520
TALIESIN: Sondur.

02:36:30.520 --> 02:36:33.170
LAURA: Sondur, Sondur. Sandor is in Game of
Thrones.

02:36:33.170 --> 02:36:34.270
MATT: Yes.

02:36:34.270 --> 02:36:40.570
LAURA: And then I'm going to attack him with the
sky sentinel bow.

02:36:40.570 --> 02:36:43.930
MATT: Go for it.

02:36:43.930 --> 02:36:53.930
LAURA: (nervous noises) 17 on the first one.

02:36:53.930 --> 02:36:54.790
MATT: Misses.

02:36:54.790 --> 02:36:56.280
LAURA: Natural 20 on the second one.

02:36:56.280 --> 02:36:57.100
MARISHA: What up!

02:36:57.100 --> 02:37:00.920
LAURA: And 19 on the third.

02:37:00.920 --> 02:37:01.920
MATT: Misses.

02:37:01.920 --> 02:37:04.010
LAURA: Fucking balls mother bitch, okay, wow.

02:37:04.010 --> 02:37:07.040
MATT: But the critical hit, so go ahead and roll
damage for the critical.

02:37:07.040 --> 02:37:08.780
LAURA: So what, do I just double all my dice?

02:37:08.780 --> 02:37:15.720
MATT: Yeah, double the dice and then add the bonus
at the end.

02:37:15.720 --> 02:37:17.370
SAM: How's the Sky bar?

02:37:17.370 --> 02:37:20.110
MARISHA: I think this is caramel? Nope, fudge.

02:37:20.110 --> 02:37:21.420
TALIESIN: Oh, you got the fudge end.

02:37:21.420 --> 02:37:23.000
MARISHA: I got the fudge end.

02:37:23.000 --> 02:37:31.840
LAURA: 16 times two is 32, yeah? Plus seven,
plus two. 41.

02:37:31.840 --> 02:37:35.030
MATT: 41 points of damage.

02:37:35.030 --> 02:37:40.740
LAURA: On the first attack. And then I'll attack
him again. 'Cause that was just one.

02:37:40.740 --> 02:37:43.880
MATT: Right, that was the sky sentinel. You didn't
double the bonus, right,

02:37:43.880 --> 02:37:45.500
that was just the dice roll?

02:37:45.500 --> 02:37:46.870
LAURA: Nope, I just doubled the dice.

02:37:46.870 --> 02:37:49.820
MATT: Shit, yeah, with Hunter's Mark, yeah,
that's slick. All right, go for it.

02:37:49.820 --> 02:37:52.880
LAURA: Okay, so the second one, I'm gonna attack
him through the blazing bowstring.

02:37:52.880 --> 02:37:56.300
MATT: Go for it.

02:37:56.300 --> 02:37:58.400
LAURA: And that is a 30.

02:37:58.400 --> 02:37:59.950
MATT: 30 hits, yes.

02:37:59.950 --> 02:38:01.910
TRAVIS: How high is Sondur?

02:38:01.910 --> 02:38:07.770
MATT: He is roughly 30 feet up.

02:38:07.770 --> 02:38:10.390
TALIESIN: At the very least, I might try and get
him to drop the bow, and then you're gonna be the

02:38:10.390 --> 02:38:14.150
one who has to grab it if things get...

02:38:14.150 --> 02:38:19.330
LAURA: Is 14 plus eight, is 22. 22 on the second.

02:38:19.330 --> 02:38:21.370
MATT: 22 points of damage. Nice.

02:38:21.370 --> 02:38:26.280
LAURA: And that was with eight points of fire
damage. I don't know if that matters.

02:38:26.280 --> 02:38:29.090
LIAM: Is he pressed against the roof of this
chamber?

02:38:29.090 --> 02:38:31.270
MATT: He's getting up towards the roof, yeah.

02:38:31.270 --> 02:38:32.700
LIAM: Towards it.

02:38:32.700 --> 02:38:36.990
MATT: As the two arrows shhhk to the side,
the one single arrow pierces into the side of his

02:38:36.990 --> 02:38:40.860
chest and arm where Percy had shot before,
and the arrow disappears into the side,

02:38:40.860 --> 02:38:45.030
and you see a burst of electrical energy causing
the one arm that was getting ready to pull one of

02:38:45.030 --> 02:38:48.810
its thorny arrows kind of goes limp for a second,
and a second arrow just shoots right in the side

02:38:48.810 --> 02:38:53.160
of the face and is now protruding from underneath
his cheekbone. (angry breathing)

02:38:53.160 --> 02:38:57.820
LAURA: And for my movement, can I get on my broom
for my movement?

02:38:57.820 --> 02:38:59.200
MATT: You'd have to--

02:38:59.200 --> 02:39:00.600
LAURA: I'd have to pull it out.

02:39:00.600 --> 02:39:03.010
MATT: Your broom is kind of slung over your
shoulder.

02:39:03.010 --> 02:39:08.430
LAURA: Right. Okay. Then I'm just gonna...
I feel like anywhere I go it's danger-zone in

02:39:08.430 --> 02:39:10.700
here. I'm gonna try to hide behind that tree in
the middle,

02:39:10.700 --> 02:39:12.740
but I feel like that's a bad idea. Yeah.

02:39:12.740 --> 02:39:16.770
MATT: You're right there.

02:39:16.770 --> 02:39:19.520
LAURA: I don't want him to be able to hit me with
arrows if possible.

02:39:19.520 --> 02:39:24.500
MATT: Right, no worries. At the end of your turn,
he's going to use two of his legendary actions to

02:39:24.500 --> 02:39:32.120
try and cast a different spell, actually.
He begins to, from up there above, lifts his hand

02:39:32.120 --> 02:39:41.280
up like this. I need everyone but Grog to make a
dexterity saving throw, including the treants.

02:39:41.280 --> 02:39:43.070
MARISHA: Including me inside the treant?

02:39:43.070 --> 02:39:45.880
SAM: I guess I will try to counterspell this one
as well.

02:39:45.880 --> 02:39:47.780
MATT: Okay.

02:39:47.780 --> 02:39:50.470
SAM: Also at level five, I don't know if that
helps.

02:39:50.470 --> 02:39:54.950
MATT: All right. So go ahead and roll, plus six.

02:39:54.950 --> 02:39:59.210
SAM: All right. Plus six? 16.

02:39:59.210 --> 02:40:12.000
MATT: Nope. Sorry. Close, you were one off.
So dexterity saving throws for the treants.

02:40:12.000 --> 02:40:15.760
Nope. And nope.

02:40:15.760 --> 02:40:17.480
LAURA: 17.

02:40:17.480 --> 02:40:18.570
LIAM: 29.

02:40:18.570 --> 02:40:20.080
MATT: So Vax succeeds.

02:40:20.080 --> 02:40:21.930
LAURA: 17.

02:40:21.930 --> 02:40:23.980
MATT: Grog, you don't have to worry about it,
'cause you're out of the radius.

02:40:23.980 --> 02:40:25.010
MARISHA: 16.

02:40:25.010 --> 02:40:27.820
TALIESIN: 14.

02:40:27.820 --> 02:40:28.780
SAM: Oh, am I rolling for--

02:40:28.780 --> 02:40:29.700
MATT: Yes, you are.

02:40:29.700 --> 02:40:31.170
SAM: What is the save?

02:40:31.170 --> 02:40:32.740
MATT: This is a dexterity saving throw.

02:40:32.740 --> 02:40:37.560
SAM: Dexterity saving throw. 14.

02:40:37.560 --> 02:40:45.260
MATT: All right. Vax, only you succeed. Suddenly
you feel as if there is a sense of weightlessness,

02:40:45.260 --> 02:40:49.380
or at least you're being drawn at a very intense
speed upward in the room. Vax, you manage to reach

02:40:49.380 --> 02:40:52.460
down and grab one of the roots on the ground and
hold yourself there while the rest of you are

02:40:52.460 --> 02:40:57.100
thrown, including the treants, at a similar
velocity as you would plummet off a cliff,

02:40:57.100 --> 02:41:04.530
but upward. Up into the ceiling and roof,
slamming into the roots, crack! And then gravity

02:41:04.530 --> 02:41:11.280
returns to normal and all of you fall, once again,
slamming back down onto the ground.

02:41:11.280 --> 02:41:14.510
MARISHA: Am I immune to that as a fire elemental?

02:41:14.510 --> 02:41:18.080
MATT: You still take bludgeoning damage as an
elemental.

02:41:18.080 --> 02:41:22.380
MARISHA: Just resistant to it.

02:41:22.380 --> 02:41:25.050
SAM: How high's the roof above the ground?

02:41:25.050 --> 02:41:30.580
MATT: It's about 50 feet at the top.

02:41:30.580 --> 02:41:33.650
LAURA: So 100... no, that's just two times in a
row.

02:41:33.650 --> 02:41:35.060
SAM: Two 50 drops.

02:41:35.060 --> 02:41:36.210
LAURA: Wow.

02:41:36.210 --> 02:41:46.880
MATT: That's a total of 24 points of bludgeoning
damage to all of you except for Vax.

02:41:46.880 --> 02:41:48.370
MARISHA: I take half damage.

02:41:48.370 --> 02:41:49.990
MATT: You take half that, because--

02:41:49.990 --> 02:41:51.390
MARISHA: How much did you say it was? 24?

02:41:51.390 --> 02:41:52.110
SAM: 24.

02:41:52.110 --> 02:41:54.490
MATT: Not you, Grog, you're unaffected by it.
Yeah. But the treants also take it.

02:41:54.490 --> 02:41:58.100
SAM: Oh! Poor guys.

02:41:58.100 --> 02:42:02.440
MATT: All righty.

02:42:02.440 --> 02:42:04.960
SAM: No problem, no problem.

02:42:04.960 --> 02:42:09.520
MATT: End of Vex's turn. Vax, you're up.
You watch as all of your friends and the treants

02:42:09.520 --> 02:42:14.320
come crashing down from the ceiling, slamming,
you hear the groans of various people getting up

02:42:14.320 --> 02:42:18.030
off of root knots on the ground.

02:42:18.030 --> 02:42:20.480
Your feet come back to you, and it's your
go.

02:42:20.480 --> 02:42:23.870
LIAM: So the treants are prone, right?

02:42:23.870 --> 02:42:26.640
MATT: In fact, everybody here for the most part is
prone, yes.

02:42:26.640 --> 02:42:31.390
LIAM: Everybody's prone, and that gives me
advantage on the attack as well, doesn't it?

02:42:31.390 --> 02:42:32.980
MATT: Technically, yes.

02:42:32.980 --> 02:42:35.360
MARISHA: I'm immune to prone.

02:42:35.360 --> 02:42:41.450
LIAM: All right, so I'm just gonna whip down and
stab into the treant that's at my feet now.

02:42:41.450 --> 02:42:43.350
MATT: All righty, go for it.

02:42:43.350 --> 02:42:45.820
LIAM: Okay, first attack is a 29.

02:42:45.820 --> 02:42:47.270
MATT: That definitely hits.

02:42:47.270 --> 02:42:51.900
LIAM: Well, actually, yeah, 29. Second attack is a
29.

02:42:51.900 --> 02:42:53.230
MATT: Hits.

02:42:53.230 --> 02:42:56.720
LIAM: Third attack is a 17.

02:42:56.720 --> 02:42:58.490
MATT: Hits. All three hit.

02:42:58.490 --> 02:42:59.510
LIAM: Okay, so the first one...

02:42:59.510 --> 02:43:01.200
MATT: Percy, you're up next.

02:43:01.200 --> 02:43:03.750
LIAM: Which is with the dagger of venom,
I don't know if it'll do anything, but I'm gonna

02:43:03.750 --> 02:43:31.920
use the poison in it. Two... eight... 28, and the
poison DC on that is 15.

02:43:31.990 --> 02:43:35.200
MATT: No, it does not succeed, it rolled a one.

02:43:35.200 --> 02:43:39.210
LIAM: 11 points of poison damage on top of that.

02:43:39.210 --> 02:43:40.650
MATT: All righty.

02:43:40.650 --> 02:43:46.220
LIAM: Second attack does seven. This is the
flametongue dagger,

02:43:46.220 --> 02:43:47.940
I don't know if that's going
to do anything--

02:43:47.940 --> 02:43:49.930
MATT: Sorry, how much on the first attack again?

02:43:49.930 --> 02:43:51.250
LIAM: And the third attack does--

02:43:51.250 --> 02:43:53.630
TRAVIS: Liam, how much was your first attack?

02:43:53.630 --> 02:43:57.060
LIAM: I don't remember, now. Uh, I can figure it
out...

02:43:57.060 --> 02:44:01.910
MATT: Make sure I got it right.

02:44:01.910 --> 02:44:06.810
LIAM: It was roughly, it was 20-something. 25.

02:44:06.810 --> 02:44:10.450
MATT: Yeah, we're good, we're good. All right,
third strike?

02:44:10.450 --> 02:44:12.100
LIAM: Third strike got eight.

02:44:12.100 --> 02:44:13.600
MATT: Eight, got it.

02:44:13.600 --> 02:44:14.550
LIAM: Thanks.

02:44:14.550 --> 02:44:17.920
MATT: As it's on the ground, sprawled out,
flames still burning off of it, you leap up onto

02:44:17.920 --> 02:44:22.720
its thigh and come down to some of the open wound
that Keyleth's fire elemental's been tearing

02:44:22.720 --> 02:44:26.720
through, you're just prying into it with your
daggers and pulling the bark back, revealing its

02:44:26.720 --> 02:44:36.470
softer, burning underwood, if you will. You do a
sincerely awful amount of damage to it, and it

02:44:36.470 --> 02:44:39.870
looks like the creature's already in dire
straits.

02:44:39.870 --> 02:44:41.410
SAM: This is one of the treants?

02:44:41.410 --> 02:44:42.540
MATT: One of the treants, yes.

02:44:42.540 --> 02:44:43.410
SAM: Oh, okay.

02:44:43.410 --> 02:44:44.950
MATT: Does that end your turn?

02:44:44.950 --> 02:44:48.800
LIAM: I just quickly look into Keyleth's flaming
eyes and say, "Finish it off," and then I'm going

02:44:48.800 --> 02:44:57.670
to run double speed along the curve of the wall
underneath flying fuck.

02:44:57.670 --> 02:44:58.690
MATT: This way?

02:44:58.690 --> 02:44:59.380
LIAM: Yeah.

02:44:59.380 --> 02:45:00.560
MARISHA: Other way, I think.

02:45:00.560 --> 02:45:02.760
MATT: Oh, this way. The one that's not flaming?

02:45:02.760 --> 02:45:05.640
LIAM: Past Keyleth and the one that I just stabbed
the shit out of.

02:45:05.640 --> 02:45:07.110
LAURA: Oh, the other way, you were going the right
way.

02:45:07.110 --> 02:45:08.050
MATT: This way.

02:45:08.050 --> 02:45:09.000
LIAM: Yeah.

02:45:09.000 --> 02:45:13.930
MATT: Okay. You're about there with your
movement.

02:45:13.930 --> 02:45:15.820
LIAM: I've got double speed.

02:45:15.820 --> 02:45:21.170
MATT: All right. Oh yeah, double speed, you'd
actually get closer to there if you wanted.

02:45:21.170 --> 02:45:25.970
All right, that ends your turn. Percy, you're up.
Actually, at the end of Percy's turn he's gonna

02:45:25.970 --> 02:45:33.000
use his last legendary action to go ahead and make
an attack with Fenthras. As he sees you running

02:45:33.000 --> 02:45:36.400
past, Vax, he goes ahead and takes one arrow shot
at you

02:45:36.400 --> 02:45:38.850
as you're running super fast across the
floor.

02:45:38.850 --> 02:45:40.780
LIAM: Disadvantage.

02:45:40.780 --> 02:45:42.450
MATT: No, because, well, no--

02:45:42.450 --> 02:45:43.390
LIAM: Turns on--

02:45:43.390 --> 02:45:47.750
MATT: -- no, you did, at the beginning of your
turn it did, you're right. So. Good thing, too,

02:45:47.750 --> 02:45:54.550
19 and a one. It goes to fire but you're too
quick, and as it releases its spikelike arrow,

02:45:54.550 --> 02:46:00.230
you hear it go right past you, catching the edge
of the cloak and actually going through it,

02:46:00.230 --> 02:46:06.340
leaving a small hole in the corner, but no impact
to you. All right, so now, Percy, it's your turn.

02:46:06.340 --> 02:46:09.750
TALIESIN: We're both prone, does that mean that
we're in combat,

02:46:09.750 --> 02:46:11.660
or can I walk away from it and it doesn't--

02:46:11.660 --> 02:46:13.810
MATT: You're both prone, you can walk away without
it getting an attack of opportunity, you just

02:46:13.810 --> 02:46:15.630
spend half your movement to get up.

02:46:15.630 --> 02:46:20.460
TALIESIN: All right, I'm spending half my movement
to get up, and I'm backing up against the wall.

02:46:20.460 --> 02:46:22.730
MATT: Okay.

02:46:22.730 --> 02:46:28.050
TALIESIN: Backing up against the wall. I'm not
using Bad News, I'm going to use Retort,

02:46:28.050 --> 02:46:35.540
I'm going to try and, first thing I'm gonna do is
use a bonus action to heal a little bit. Yeah.

02:46:35.540 --> 02:46:46.580
That's nine plus twelve, so that's 21. Figure
that out when it's not my turn. Next thing I'm

02:46:46.580 --> 02:46:51.030
gonna do is I'm gonna start shooting to try and
get that bow out of his hands one more time.

02:46:51.030 --> 02:46:52.120
MATT: Okay.

02:46:52.120 --> 02:46:53.700
TALIESIN: First shot...

02:46:53.700 --> 02:46:55.740
MATT: This is with Retort, right?

02:46:55.740 --> 02:47:06.800
TALIESIN: Retort, yeah. Same trick, but not nearly
as much damage. That's 16 to hit?

02:47:06.800 --> 02:47:12.030
MATT: Hits the nearby wood, splinters off one of
the vines, sending a shower of broken wood chips.

02:47:12.030 --> 02:47:13.460
TALIESIN: Firing again.

02:47:13.460 --> 02:47:15.230
LIAM: C'mon, dangerous nerd, do it!

02:47:15.230 --> 02:47:17.700
LAURA: (laughs) Dangerous nerd.

02:47:17.700 --> 02:47:21.190
TALIESIN: That's another 16.

02:47:21.190 --> 02:47:24.930
MATT: Can't quite catch a bead on it. Being a
human without dark vision, it's hard to see it in

02:47:24.930 --> 02:47:26.680
the low glowing light.

02:47:26.680 --> 02:47:29.450
MARISHA: I give off a soft glow.

02:47:29.450 --> 02:47:31.910
MATT: But at a distance.

02:47:31.910 --> 02:47:33.470
TALIESIN: 18 to hit?

02:47:33.470 --> 02:47:34.370
MATT: That misses.

02:47:34.370 --> 02:47:38.620
(All groan.)

02:47:38.620 --> 02:47:45.320
TALIESIN: God damn it. Okay. That's my bloody
roll.

02:47:45.320 --> 02:47:47.730
MARISHA: That's always a bummer, man. That sucks.

02:47:47.730 --> 02:47:51.990
MATT: Ending Percy's turn, that brings us to our
next set of lair actions. All right.

02:47:51.990 --> 02:47:55.520
TALIESIN: God damn it.

02:47:55.520 --> 02:48:00.460
MATT: Suddenly all the vines on the nearby walls
on the inside of the tree whip out and begin

02:48:00.460 --> 02:48:09.060
grabbing anyone nearby. Percy, Scanlan, Keyleth,
and Vax, you guys are all of a sudden, the vines

02:48:09.060 --> 02:48:13.030
try and wrap around you. They pull you back.

02:48:13.030 --> 02:48:14.830
MARISHA: Immune to grapple.

02:48:14.830 --> 02:48:15.520
MATT: So yeah.

02:48:15.520 --> 02:48:16.650
LIAM: Dexterity save?

02:48:16.650 --> 02:48:20.930
MATT: The vines try and wrap around you, Keyleth,
and burn in the process. You are still pulled

02:48:20.930 --> 02:48:29.650
right against the wall. I need Vax, Scanlan,
and Percy to make a strength saving throw.

02:48:29.650 --> 02:48:30.460
SAM: Strength.

02:48:30.460 --> 02:48:31.310
LIAM: Strength.

02:48:31.310 --> 02:48:32.220
MATT: Yes.

02:48:32.220 --> 02:48:36.260
SAM: Oh, god. Just straight strength?

02:48:36.260 --> 02:48:37.180
TALIESIN: 23.

02:48:37.180 --> 02:48:38.460
SAM: 15.

02:48:38.460 --> 02:48:39.980
LIAM: Burn a Luck. Ah, 20.

02:48:39.980 --> 02:48:45.110
MATT: 20, okay. Vax and Percy, you guys manage to
break free of the vines. Scanlan, you are

02:48:45.110 --> 02:48:48.680
considered grappled, so your speed is zero.
The vines are actually holding you against the

02:48:48.680 --> 02:48:52.290
side. They're not hurting you or anything,
but you cannot actually move from your space

02:48:52.290 --> 02:48:56.000
'cause you're being held against the wall of the
tree.

02:48:56.000 --> 02:48:59.980
That ends the legendary action. Grog,
you're up.

02:48:59.980 --> 02:49:05.030
TRAVIS: Can I run immediately underneath Sondur?

02:49:05.030 --> 02:49:06.680
MATT: Sondur, yes you can.

02:49:06.680 --> 02:49:11.680
TRAVIS: Are there any vines that are hanging from
him? There are none?

02:49:11.680 --> 02:49:16.530
MATT: There are vines hanging from the ceiling,
but he himself just kind of sunk into the tree

02:49:16.530 --> 02:49:21.390
and then emerged above, he himself does not have
any wayward vines that are just hanging.

02:49:21.390 --> 02:49:24.230
TRAVIS: Right. Are there any vines that look like
they might be thick enough for me to try and climb

02:49:24.230 --> 02:49:25.960
up if I wanted to get to his height?

02:49:25.960 --> 02:49:28.040
MATT: Probably a couple, yeah.

02:49:28.040 --> 02:49:34.880
TRAVIS: Could I grab a few of those vines to try
and climb up to where he's at?

02:49:34.880 --> 02:49:39.310
MATT: Make an athletics check. With disadvantage.
And then you have advantage because you're

02:49:39.310 --> 02:49:44.680
raging, so just a straight roll on that.

02:49:44.680 --> 02:49:48.300
TRAVIS: Athletics. 23.

02:49:48.300 --> 02:49:56.950
MATT: 23, all right, let me check and see how far
you can actually climb at that speed.

02:49:56.950 --> 02:50:04.870
SAM: Tense fight, guys. Wouldn't wanna be in it
with anyone else.

02:50:04.870 --> 02:50:07.100
LIAM: Us against the environment.

02:50:07.100 --> 02:50:09.380
SAM: I think that my plan should work.

02:50:09.380 --> 02:50:13.350
MATT: I'd say your physical strength and your
ability to just kind of one hand over hand,

02:50:13.350 --> 02:50:17.470
not even pull up, especially with your Titan
gauntlets and that type of a roll, you could

02:50:17.470 --> 02:50:20.930
probably get right up to him, but that's gonna be
your action to get up there.

02:50:20.930 --> 02:50:21.930
TRAVIS: Okay.

02:50:21.930 --> 02:50:25.450
MATT: So you'll only have your bonus action left
at that time, but essentially you climb up and get

02:50:25.450 --> 02:50:30.530
right up to where he is at the top of the tree.
As he's up there pulling the bow back, getting

02:50:30.530 --> 02:50:36.650
ready to, you see another pointed arrow kind of
shift out of his arm, you come right up to his

02:50:36.650 --> 02:50:39.810
face and you're right there holding on with the
vines,

02:50:39.810 --> 02:50:43.140
with the axe hanging over your shoulder
with the chain.

02:50:43.140 --> 02:50:48.910
TRAVIS: With my bonus action, can I let out the
loudest howl I possibly can.

02:50:48.910 --> 02:50:51.760
MATT: Yes, you can.

02:50:51.760 --> 02:50:55.420
TRAVIS: (howls)

02:50:55.420 --> 02:50:57.600
MATT: All righty.

02:50:57.600 --> 02:51:00.400
MARISHA: Calling in the cavalry.

02:51:00.400 --> 02:51:02.400
LAURA: Yeah, come on! Please, I hope he can get in
here.

02:51:02.400 --> 02:51:03.310
MATT: That's your turn?

02:51:03.310 --> 02:51:04.510
TRAVIS: That's my turn.

02:51:04.510 --> 02:51:06.730
MATT: All right. It is now Sondur's turn.

02:51:06.730 --> 02:51:08.560
SAM: Oh boy.

02:51:08.560 --> 02:51:09.400
MATT: All righty.

02:51:09.400 --> 02:51:11.470
LAURA: He's deaf from that howl, he's definitely
deaf.

02:51:11.470 --> 02:51:20.530
MATT: No, not so much. Sondur takes Fenthras and
actually lets go of it to his side, and these

02:51:20.530 --> 02:51:25.810
vines grab it and hold it in place just wherever
he lets it go. As he pulls back, his fingers curl

02:51:25.810 --> 02:51:32.030
up into these giant, extremely hard petrified
root-like clusters, and he just starts starts

02:51:32.030 --> 02:51:37.740
whaling on you as you're holding onto that vine.
Three strikes against you.

02:51:37.740 --> 02:51:39.960
The first one is gonna
be a 25.

02:51:39.960 --> 02:51:42.060
TRAVIS: Hits.

02:51:42.060 --> 02:51:43.540
MATT: Second one is a 23.

02:51:43.540 --> 02:51:44.510
TRAVIS: Also hits.

02:51:44.510 --> 02:51:47.780
MATT: Third one is a 15.

02:51:47.780 --> 02:51:49.770
TRAVIS: Misses.

02:51:49.770 --> 02:51:58.830
MATT: It hits you, but just not enough to do any
damage. So, looking at this, that brings it to,

02:51:58.830 --> 02:52:08.360
oh no, that's two. 14 points of bludgeoning
damage on the first one, halved.

02:52:08.360 --> 02:52:10.130
And the second one--

02:52:10.130 --> 02:52:12.320
LAURA: Oh, it's just the fucking coolest.

02:52:12.320 --> 02:52:16.810
MATT: 22 points of bludgeoning damage, reduced to
11. I need you to go ahead and make a strength

02:52:16.810 --> 02:52:20.530
saving throw to maintain your hold on that vine.

02:52:20.530 --> 02:52:24.960
As he just bats you around.

02:52:24.960 --> 02:52:26.420
TRAVIS: That's a 21.

02:52:26.420 --> 02:52:31.070
MATT: 21. It punches you twice, and your grip
causes you to slide a foot, but you catch yourself

02:52:31.070 --> 02:52:35.770
and you're still maintaining yourself. The vine is
now swinging from the impact, and you're in the

02:52:35.770 --> 02:52:39.610
process of this weird momentum where you're
passing by a little out of control with your

02:52:39.610 --> 02:52:42.860
movement up in the air of the inside of this
tree.

02:52:42.860 --> 02:52:44.090
TRAVIS: Awesome.

02:52:44.090 --> 02:52:52.040
MATT: So that's gonna end its action. You now
watch as Sondur reaches up and grabs the bow again

02:52:52.040 --> 02:52:59.160
and shifts into the tree to get away from you.
You do get an attack of opportunity, though.

02:52:59.160 --> 02:53:05.900
As you come around, watching him sink in with
your one hand on the axe.

02:53:05.900 --> 02:53:12.680
TRAVIS: Oh, that was so close to being a crit.
That is a 33.

02:53:12.680 --> 02:53:14.270
MATT: (laughs)

02:53:14.270 --> 02:53:16.100
LAURA: 19 isn't a crit for him, right?

02:53:16.100 --> 02:53:16.940
TRAVIS: No.

02:53:16.940 --> 02:53:22.810
MATT: No. So go ahead, I will say the damage is
gonna be a 1d10 rather than a 1d12, just for the

02:53:22.810 --> 02:53:28.630
sake of, you're swinging with one hand.

02:53:28.630 --> 02:53:36.460
TRAVIS: That's... wait, no, that's 22 plus one
point of necrotic damage, so 23.

02:53:36.460 --> 02:53:41.600
MATT: All right, so 23 points of slashing damage
as you come around, as the vine is arcing around,

02:53:41.600 --> 02:53:47.500
whack! You cleave through, catch part of the side
of the shoulder and the jaw. Part of this hard

02:53:47.500 --> 02:53:52.890
bony root exterior actually gets carved off and
you see more black ooze spill out from underneath

02:53:52.890 --> 02:54:01.780
as it shrieks, pulling back into the tree.
You watch him vanish, you're still left there.

02:54:01.780 --> 02:54:03.270
TRAVIS: Killed him.

02:54:03.270 --> 02:54:05.080
LAURA: Good job, Grog.

02:54:05.080 --> 02:54:09.560
LIAM: Smacked him into the wall.

02:54:09.560 --> 02:54:15.190
TRAVIS: Not so tough, really.

02:54:15.190 --> 02:54:23.910
LIAM: Go hide like a potato in the earth.
Oh jeez.

02:54:23.910 --> 02:54:34.280
MATT: As high up as Sondur can get, right at the
edge, actually emerging out of the ceiling portion

02:54:34.280 --> 02:54:38.940
of the top of it, ten feet higher than he was
before, he comes out with Fenthras.

02:54:38.940 --> 02:54:41.040
LAURA: Ten feet higher than he was before?

02:54:41.040 --> 02:54:44.480
MATT: Before, he was out of the wall, before the
ceiling even came up into a cone. He's now coming

02:54:44.480 --> 02:54:46.290
out of the ceiling in another part.

02:54:46.290 --> 02:54:47.340
LAURA: Jeez.

02:54:47.340 --> 02:54:50.910
MATT: Now hanging out halfway and ready to go
ahead and let loose with a bow, that's gonna end

02:54:50.910 --> 02:54:52.060
his turn, however.

02:54:52.060 --> 02:54:54.770
LIAM: How high off the ground is that apex that
he's hanging out of?

02:54:54.770 --> 02:54:57.070
MATT: Right now he's 40 feet up.

02:54:57.070 --> 02:54:58.580
LIAM: 40 feet, all right.

02:54:58.580 --> 02:55:03.020
MATT: Yep. That ends his turn, it is now the
treants' go. They both get up, using half their

02:55:03.020 --> 02:55:12.400
movement. (laughs) Let's see. That one currently
is just being harried with the flames on the

02:55:12.400 --> 02:55:14.990
inside, it takes, does it take any damage on its
turn?

02:55:14.990 --> 02:55:21.370
MARISHA: It does. Unless he douses himself,
he takes another 1d10.

02:55:21.370 --> 02:55:24.260
MATT: Go ahead and do 1d10 damage to him.

02:55:24.260 --> 02:55:27.960
MARISHA: Six.

02:55:27.960 --> 02:55:29.240
TALIESIN: Doubled.

02:55:29.240 --> 02:55:30.860
LAURA: Doubled, yeah.

02:55:30.860 --> 02:55:34.770
MATT: As it begins to take the damage, it begins
to pat out the flames, but as it does, the fire

02:55:34.770 --> 02:55:40.520
just roars into this inferno, and you hear it give
out this creaking, painful (pained groan) as it

02:55:40.520 --> 02:55:45.320
tumbles forward in a timber fashion, the flames
actually burning the life essence out of the

02:55:45.320 --> 02:55:50.270
treant. It falls to the ground, dead, smoldering.

02:55:50.270 --> 02:55:52.050
SAM: Hey, damn!

02:55:52.050 --> 02:55:53.320
TRAVIS: Yes.

02:55:53.320 --> 02:55:57.750
MATT: You pop out of his form as the living entity
is no longer living and you are but an elemental

02:55:57.750 --> 02:56:02.460
now. I'm gonna leave him there just for reference,
because it is a big thing to get through.

02:56:02.460 --> 02:56:06.420
But you are now pushed off to the side.
That treant is gone. The other one gets up and

02:56:06.420 --> 02:56:10.730
steps over to Percy.

02:56:10.730 --> 02:56:12.060
TALIESIN: I made a friend.

02:56:12.060 --> 02:56:14.980
MATT: You did. As you just manage to avoid that,
the treant comes up

02:56:14.980 --> 02:56:16.690
and goes into a double-slam against you.

02:56:16.690 --> 02:56:18.000
LAURA: Fuck.

02:56:18.000 --> 02:56:20.010
MATT: That is gonna be 19.

02:56:20.010 --> 02:56:21.160
TALIESIN: That hits.

02:56:21.160 --> 02:56:22.660
MATT: And 21.

02:56:22.660 --> 02:56:24.140
TALIESIN: That also hits.

02:56:24.140 --> 02:56:29.920
MATT: All righty. You take--

02:56:29.920 --> 02:56:31.460
TALIESIN: I'm fine.

02:56:31.460 --> 02:56:41.280
MATT: 13 points of bludgeoning damage. 20 points
of bludgeoning damage on the second hit.

02:56:41.280 --> 02:56:42.390
LAURA: (gasps)

02:56:42.390 --> 02:56:44.040
TALIESIN: That's mean.

02:56:44.040 --> 02:56:47.140
MATT: It's now pushing you up against the side of
the tree. You can feel the roots hitting the back

02:56:47.140 --> 02:56:52.450
of your head, and as you ricochet off the impact,
you come into another fist right to the face.

02:56:52.450 --> 02:56:56.410
You feel the nose break under the impact and
possibly a tooth get loose as you spit blood out

02:56:56.410 --> 02:56:59.050
the side. It was a rough hit on you.

02:56:59.050 --> 02:57:00.530
TALIESIN: Yeah, that was rough.

02:57:00.530 --> 02:57:04.970
MATT: All right. That ends the treants' turn.
Scanlan and Keyleth, you're up.

02:57:04.970 --> 02:57:09.240
MARISHA: You're still--

02:57:09.240 --> 02:57:12.610
MATT: You're grappled, and currently prone.

02:57:12.610 --> 02:57:13.960
SAM: Okay.

02:57:13.960 --> 02:57:15.790
MARISHA: Where is he? Where are you, Scanlan?

02:57:15.790 --> 02:57:17.180
SAM: I'm against the close side of the wall.

02:57:17.180 --> 02:57:18.510
MATT: You're over there.

02:57:18.510 --> 02:57:20.960
But because your movement is zero and you're
grappled, you cannot get up. So right now you are

02:57:20.960 --> 02:57:23.370
prone and stuck to a wall.

02:57:23.370 --> 02:57:25.390
SAM: Can I pull out a wand, or not even?

02:57:25.390 --> 02:57:27.920
MATT: You can pull out a wand, you're just at
disadvantage for all attacks right now.

02:57:27.920 --> 02:57:30.270
SAM: All attacks. Even spell attacks?

02:57:30.270 --> 02:57:33.300
MATT: You have disadvantage on attack rolls,
and any attack rolls against you have advantage,

02:57:33.300 --> 02:57:37.210
yeah. If they're within five feet of you.
Otherwise they have disadvantage.

02:57:37.210 --> 02:57:39.320
MARISHA: I might be able to try and do something,
if I can go first.

02:57:39.320 --> 02:57:41.330
SAM: That's attack rolls, Fireballs just happen.

02:57:41.330 --> 02:57:42.390
MATT: Correct.

02:57:42.390 --> 02:57:44.330
MARISHA: Maybe I can burn you away.

02:57:44.330 --> 02:57:52.570
SAM: I'll do Fireball on the treant. I'll aim it
far away enough so that it won't hit us.

02:57:52.570 --> 02:57:55.470
Is that a thing? Is that possible?

02:57:55.470 --> 02:58:00.130
MATT: It is, it's hard because you're on the
ground and he's right there.

02:58:00.130 --> 02:58:02.550
SAM: Can I go up?

02:58:02.550 --> 02:58:05.030
LAURA: Can you hit Sondur?

02:58:05.030 --> 02:58:07.770
SAM: Well, yeah, but I don't know how--

02:58:07.770 --> 02:58:11.780
MATT: It's your call. It's a tough circumstance
here, because to hit the treant from your

02:58:11.780 --> 02:58:15.100
perspective, you'd have to hit behind it,
but you have no view behind it

02:58:15.100 --> 02:58:16.430
because you're on the ground.

02:58:16.430 --> 02:58:18.010
SAM: Got it. Got it. All right.

02:58:18.010 --> 02:58:23.930
MATT: I mean, if you want to try that, I'll give
you a roll, and based on how good you roll it may

02:58:23.930 --> 02:58:26.160
or may not hit an ally.

02:58:26.160 --> 02:58:32.270
SAM: Then I will not risk it and I will just
Fireball good old Sondur, I guess.

02:58:32.270 --> 02:58:34.710
MATT: All righty. How many more--

02:58:34.710 --> 02:58:37.460
SAM: I'll use three more charges. I have seven
total.

02:58:37.460 --> 02:58:39.780
MATT: Okay. Seven total left? Or total?

02:58:39.780 --> 02:58:41.910
SAM: Total. So I've used three.

02:58:41.910 --> 02:58:44.230
MATT: Well no, you used five last time.

02:58:44.230 --> 02:58:48.800
SAM: I thought the first one is just three balls?
No? I don't know how this shit works.

02:58:48.800 --> 02:58:50.640
MATT: What does it say on the actual item?

02:58:50.640 --> 02:58:53.150
SAM: I don't have it anymore. I lost it months and
months ago.

02:58:53.150 --> 02:58:56.390
(All laugh.)

02:58:56.390 --> 02:59:02.050
MATT: It's a good thing it's in the Dungeon
Master's Guide. God damn it, Sam. Let me know

02:59:02.050 --> 02:59:05.550
these things, I can get you the item printout.

02:59:05.550 --> 02:59:07.760
LIAM: King of improv. Right here.

02:59:07.760 --> 02:59:12.270
MATT: Okay. Wand of Fireballs, has seven charges.
You can use an action to expend one or more

02:59:12.270 --> 02:59:16.800
charges to cast the Fireball spell. For one
charge, it's the level three, and for each

02:59:16.800 --> 02:59:18.540
additional charge it's more than that. So.

02:59:18.540 --> 02:59:20.150
SAM: So I used three charges.

02:59:20.150 --> 02:59:22.280
MATT: So you used three charges, you have four
charges left, yes.

02:59:22.280 --> 02:59:23.880
SAM: Okay, so I'm gonna use three on him.

02:59:23.880 --> 02:59:27.070
MATT: Oh, three more? All right. Go for it.
That'll be another 10d6.

02:59:27.070 --> 02:59:29.120
TALIESIN: I don't understand how magic works.

02:59:29.120 --> 02:59:30.950
LAURA: I don't know, I don't understand that at
all.

02:59:30.950 --> 02:59:32.610
MATT: We'll see if he makes his saving throw.
It does not make the saving throw, it's gonna use

02:59:32.610 --> 02:59:34.340
its legendary resistance to automatically make
it.

02:59:34.340 --> 02:59:34.970
LAURA: Aw.

02:59:34.970 --> 02:59:36.080
MARISHA: Fucking dick.

02:59:36.080 --> 02:59:37.310
LAURA: Does that half it again?

02:59:37.310 --> 02:59:40.950
MATT: Yeah.

02:59:40.950 --> 02:59:42.980
TRAVIS: I have a question.

02:59:42.980 --> 02:59:44.700
MATT: What's your question, Grog?

02:59:44.700 --> 02:59:48.300
TRAVIS: I forgot about Retaliation. That's a new
feat I have.

02:59:48.300 --> 02:59:50.690
MATT: Yeah, where when it hits you you can use
your reaction, but you used your reaction to get

02:59:50.690 --> 02:59:52.740
an attack of opportunity, so you still hit him.

02:59:52.740 --> 02:59:53.980
TRAVIS: Oh, that's true.

02:59:53.980 --> 02:59:57.030
MATT: But essentially, they don't have to do that
now. As long as they hit you, you can use your

02:59:57.030 --> 02:59:58.740
reaction to just hit them back.

02:59:58.740 --> 03:00:00.090
TRAVIS: Hit them back.

03:00:00.090 --> 03:00:01.450
MATT: So yeah, as long as you stay within melee--

03:00:01.450 --> 03:00:05.390
TRAVIS: As long as I'm within five feet.
That count on his two hits against me?

03:00:05.390 --> 03:00:08.420
MATT: I mean, you can only do it once, because you
only get one reaction.

03:00:08.420 --> 03:00:09.760
TRAVIS: One time. Okay.

03:00:09.760 --> 03:00:11.780
MATT: And you technically already hit him with
that.

03:00:11.780 --> 03:00:12.790
TRAVIS: That's true.

03:00:12.790 --> 03:00:14.670
MATT: Same thing, so you used your attack of
opportunity,

03:00:14.670 --> 03:00:16.240
so you can do that whenever anybody hits you.

03:00:16.240 --> 03:00:17.200
LAURA: See, you're fine.

03:00:17.200 --> 03:00:18.380
MATT: You're good, but good to remember.

03:00:18.380 --> 03:00:19.350
SAM: Laura, are you like...

03:00:19.350 --> 03:00:20.650
LAURA: About to die? Yeah.

03:00:20.650 --> 03:00:21.860
TRAVIS: I haven't used it before.

03:00:21.860 --> 03:00:23.870
SAM: All right, that was 29. So 14.

03:00:23.870 --> 03:00:25.870
MATT: 29. Halve that, 14 points of fire damage.

03:00:25.870 --> 03:00:27.450
LAURA: Like one more hit and I'm unconscious.

03:00:27.450 --> 03:00:30.340
MATT: As another Fireball bursts into the air,
lighting up the room even brighter for an

03:00:30.340 --> 03:00:36.610
instant. You can see now as the smoke clears,
the front of Sondur's form is black and beginning

03:00:36.610 --> 03:00:43.050
to char with each blast of flame. A lot of the oil
has dried off and is now coming off in clumps.

03:00:43.050 --> 03:00:44.400
LAURA: That's good.

03:00:44.400 --> 03:00:45.970
MATT: Almost like dried mud. All right.

03:00:45.970 --> 03:00:51.840
SAM: I will also heal Vex. She's close enough,
right? Yeah? Yeah? Ish?

03:00:51.840 --> 03:00:52.940
TALIESIN: Yeah.

03:00:52.940 --> 03:00:54.460
SAM: With an inspirational quote.

03:00:54.460 --> 03:00:58.480
LAURA: (laughing) No.

03:00:58.480 --> 03:01:00.780
SAM: Something Percival once said a long,
long time ago.

03:01:00.780 --> 03:01:02.080
TALIESIN: Oh no. Oh no.

03:01:02.080 --> 03:01:02.860
LAURA: I'm ready.

03:01:02.860 --> 03:01:06.800
SAM: Life needs things to live. That's it.
That's the whole quote.

03:01:06.800 --> 03:01:09.740
(All laugh.)

03:01:09.740 --> 03:01:16.360
SAM: Earlier tonight. Percival von Fredrickstein
von Rollo de Frankenstein de Roll.

03:01:16.360 --> 03:01:19.390
Credit where credit is due.

03:01:19.390 --> 03:01:21.100
LIAM: Put it on a kitten poster.

03:01:21.100 --> 03:01:23.320
SAM: Oh, and I'll do it at level three, so that's,

03:01:23.320 --> 03:01:25.860
sorry, not inspiration, healing, healing, healing.

03:01:25.860 --> 03:01:26.800
LAURA: Oh, okay.

03:01:26.800 --> 03:01:28.570
MATT: That's right, this is a healing spell,
all right.

03:01:28.570 --> 03:01:32.080
SAM: So that's 3d4 plus six.

03:01:32.080 --> 03:01:34.430
MARISHA: Oh man.

03:01:34.430 --> 03:01:35.310
SAM: 12.

03:01:35.310 --> 03:01:36.740
LAURA: Okay, thank you!

03:01:36.740 --> 03:01:38.570
TALIESIN: 12 helps.

03:01:38.570 --> 03:01:40.060
MATT: All right, Keyleth.

03:01:40.060 --> 03:01:48.440
MARISHA: Okay. I am going to march over to that,
oh man, to that guy.

03:01:48.440 --> 03:01:50.230
TALIESIN: Number two?

03:01:50.230 --> 03:01:51.720
MARISHA: Number two. Treant number two.

03:01:51.720 --> 03:01:53.010
MATT: All right.

03:01:53.010 --> 03:01:58.040
MARISHA: I want to see if I can Tree Stride
through him--

03:01:58.040 --> 03:02:00.610
MATT: Did you take damage from the fall earlier?

03:02:00.610 --> 03:02:01.540
MARISHA: I did.

03:02:01.540 --> 03:02:03.040
MATT: Make a concentration check.

03:02:03.040 --> 03:02:04.720
SAM: (sings a note)

03:02:04.720 --> 03:02:06.530
MARISHA: Even though I have resistance on
bludgeoning damage and all that shit?

03:02:06.530 --> 03:02:10.960
MATT: Yeah. So just add your constitution
modifier.

03:02:10.960 --> 03:02:12.630
MARISHA: Oh, my constitution modifier? As a--

03:02:12.630 --> 03:02:15.800
MATT: As a fire elemental.

03:02:15.800 --> 03:02:17.020
MARISHA: Just my modifier?

03:02:17.020 --> 03:02:17.700
MATT: Yes.

03:02:17.700 --> 03:02:18.580
MARISHA: Eight.

03:02:18.580 --> 03:02:20.290
MATT: Yeah, so Tree Stride has faded. Sorry.

03:02:20.290 --> 03:02:22.990
MARISHA: Fuck!

03:02:22.990 --> 03:02:28.980
MATT: Concentration spells when you take damage,
man.

03:02:28.980 --> 03:02:35.210
MARISHA: Well, I still whelm him. That guy in
front of me. I still can move into his space.

03:02:35.210 --> 03:02:40.930
MATT: Into his space. Go ahead and make your
attacks.

03:02:40.930 --> 03:02:45.980
MARISHA: That's my fucking opal dice again.
Asshole. Oh look, and that was 18.

03:02:45.980 --> 03:02:47.390
SAM: You gotta roll it angry.

03:02:47.390 --> 03:02:49.090
LAURA: Oh, maybe that's the key.

03:02:49.090 --> 03:02:50.180
TALIESIN: Maybe you have to roll it angry.

03:02:50.180 --> 03:02:51.530
TRAVIS: You're being so fucking nice.

03:02:51.530 --> 03:02:52.410
TALIESIN: Angry die.

03:02:52.410 --> 03:02:53.900
LIAM: But she's always angry.

03:02:53.900 --> 03:02:55.060
LAURA: Just like "arrgh" every time you roll it.

03:02:55.060 --> 03:02:57.460
MATT: Keyleth must embrace her anger to actually
make the dice work for her. I like that.

03:02:57.460 --> 03:02:58.890
MARISHA: Two slam attacks.

03:02:58.890 --> 03:03:01.370
LAURA: See, that's Taliesin's secret, he's always
angry.

03:03:01.370 --> 03:03:04.450
TALIESIN: Always angry.

03:03:04.450 --> 03:03:06.200
MATT: Are you rolling with advantage?

03:03:06.200 --> 03:03:07.730
MARISHA: Do I roll with advantage?

03:03:07.730 --> 03:03:08.730
MATT: No.

03:03:08.730 --> 03:03:09.760
MARISHA: No.

03:03:09.760 --> 03:03:13.010
MATT: Sorry, I saw you roll two dice, so I...
those are both attacks at once? Got you.

03:03:13.010 --> 03:03:14.930
MARISHA: No, I'm rolling my three dice.

03:03:14.930 --> 03:03:16.400
SAM: Two slam attacks, right?

03:03:16.400 --> 03:03:18.010
MATT: You have two slam attacks. Did you roll to
hit on those?

03:03:18.010 --> 03:03:19.640
MARISHA: Oh, wait, no, I don't think I did.

03:03:19.640 --> 03:03:20.730
MATT: That's what I'm asking.

03:03:20.730 --> 03:03:21.820
MARISHA: I forgot that part.

03:03:21.820 --> 03:03:23.650
MATT: Do that first.

03:03:23.650 --> 03:03:28.370
MARISHA: Oh, man. Two 11s. Which, 17 to hit both
times.

03:03:28.370 --> 03:03:29.310
SAM: Make a wish.

03:03:29.310 --> 03:03:30.280
MATT: Both hit.

03:03:30.280 --> 03:03:37.890
MARISHA: Okay, so the first one, um. 15 for the
first one.

03:03:37.890 --> 03:03:41.980
MATT: Okay.

03:03:41.980 --> 03:03:43.880
LAURA: All the big ones, they just--

03:03:43.880 --> 03:03:45.050
TRAVIS: Love it.

03:03:45.050 --> 03:03:46.770
LAURA: They're pretty but--

03:03:46.770 --> 03:03:50.430
MARISHA: And another 15 for the second one.

03:03:50.430 --> 03:03:51.680
LAURA: Why would you do that?

03:03:51.680 --> 03:03:56.210
MATT: And for the first one, it was...

03:03:56.210 --> 03:03:58.470
TALIESIN: That don't suck. And then he's on fire
now, right?

03:03:58.470 --> 03:04:01.890
MARISHA: He's on fire. Oh, and he takes another
d10 because I moved into his space.

03:04:01.890 --> 03:04:02.860
MATT: Yeah.

03:04:02.860 --> 03:04:04.520
LAURA: Oh, good good good, that's good.

03:04:04.520 --> 03:04:05.600
MATT: And he's on fire.

03:04:05.600 --> 03:04:07.860
MARISHA: So another four points from me.

03:04:07.860 --> 03:04:09.630
SAM: (softly sings along with the background
music)

03:04:09.630 --> 03:04:11.580
MATT: All righty. The flames burn up into his
form, he starts shrieking as the flame starts

03:04:11.580 --> 03:04:16.760
curling up its body, it does not like being on
fire. That end your turn?

03:04:16.760 --> 03:04:18.250
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:04:18.250 --> 03:04:26.690
MATT: All righty. At the end of your turn,
Sondur is gonna go ahead and--

03:04:26.690 --> 03:04:29.310
SAM: I'm just gonna go ahead and borrow this.
Possibly permanently.

03:04:29.310 --> 03:04:30.300
TALIESIN: God damn it.

03:04:30.300 --> 03:04:31.760
MATT: Is gonna cast another spell.

03:04:31.760 --> 03:04:34.310
TRAVIS: Over here, you piece of shit. Nope.

03:04:34.310 --> 03:04:38.300
LAURA: Anything?

03:04:38.300 --> 03:04:41.400
TRAVIS: I cough weakly.

03:04:41.400 --> 03:04:44.510
MATT: The bow's held aloft, he looks down and sees
you on the ground, Vex.

03:04:44.510 --> 03:04:45.680
LAURA: Ow.

03:04:45.680 --> 03:04:49.610
MATT: And just extends his fingers and says,
"You had your choice."

03:04:49.690 --> 03:04:52.010
Make a constitution saving throw.

03:04:52.010 --> 03:04:57.190
LAURA: Oh, good. 20.

03:04:57.190 --> 03:04:59.540
MATT: 20? Success.

03:04:59.540 --> 03:05:01.500
(All cheer.)

03:05:01.500 --> 03:05:03.230
MATT: So you take half damage.

03:05:03.230 --> 03:05:05.410
SAM: Half damage? Wait, what? No damage!

03:05:05.410 --> 03:05:07.310
MARISHA: That sounded like a lot of dice.

03:05:07.310 --> 03:05:08.670
LAURA: That's a lot of dice.

03:05:08.670 --> 03:05:10.000
LIAM: That's a fucking miracle is what that is.

03:05:10.000 --> 03:05:15.050
TALIESIN: That sounds like a handful of hate.
That was like four dice.

03:05:15.050 --> 03:05:19.370
TRAVIS: It's okay, they're all d1s.

03:05:19.370 --> 03:05:23.550
MATT: 31 halved... you take 16 points of necrotic
damage.

03:05:23.550 --> 03:05:25.460
TALIESIN: You're good.

03:05:25.460 --> 03:05:27.150
MARISHA: You all right? Still up.

03:05:27.150 --> 03:05:28.730
MATT: As the Blight spell takes over--

03:05:28.730 --> 03:05:29.560
SAM: Whoa.

03:05:29.560 --> 03:05:34.010
MATT: -- you feel the vines wrap around you and
the life force pulled from your form momentarily.

03:05:34.010 --> 03:05:39.040
Suddenly they crack and break as you shove them
off, the air pulled from your lungs, and you gasp

03:05:39.040 --> 03:05:42.950
for air, holding onto that last little sliver of
life you still have.

03:05:42.950 --> 03:05:44.630
MARISHA: Two can play at that game, motherfucker.

03:05:44.630 --> 03:05:46.060
TALIESIN: You need healing.

03:05:46.060 --> 03:05:48.490
MATT: All righty. Now it's your turn, Vex.

03:05:48.490 --> 03:05:49.650
LAURA: Now it's my turn.

03:05:49.650 --> 03:05:50.650
MATT: Yes.

03:05:50.650 --> 03:05:53.510
LAURA: Okay. I'm gonna take, can I--

03:05:53.510 --> 03:05:55.380
MATT: You're still prone on the ground, by the
way.

03:05:55.380 --> 03:05:56.440
LAURA: I stand up.

03:05:56.440 --> 03:05:58.710
MATT: All right, so that's half your movement.

03:05:58.710 --> 03:06:01.290
LAURA: Can I take a greater healing potion?

03:06:01.290 --> 03:06:02.540
MATT: You can.

03:06:02.540 --> 03:06:03.450
LAURA: As a bonus?

03:06:03.450 --> 03:06:04.390
MATT: Yep.

03:06:04.390 --> 03:06:05.940
LAURA: How much is that?

03:06:05.940 --> 03:06:09.990
MATT: Greater healing would be 4d4 plus four.

03:06:09.990 --> 03:06:21.070
LAURA: Okay. 11 plus four is 15. Okay.

03:06:21.070 --> 03:06:23.400
SAM: Okay, okay.

03:06:23.400 --> 03:06:25.140
TRAVIS: It's that hit back.

03:06:25.140 --> 03:06:34.300
LAURA: Okay, that's good, that's good. 37, okay.
Okay. I guess I will,

03:06:34.300 --> 03:06:37.860
his Hunter's Mark is still on him, right?

03:06:37.860 --> 03:06:41.440
MATT: Actually, you should make a concentration
check because of the Blight damage, which I forgot

03:06:41.440 --> 03:06:45.080
to take as far as the fall damage earlier as well,
so make two concentration checks.

03:06:45.080 --> 03:06:46.210
LAURA: Cool.

03:06:46.210 --> 03:06:48.160
MATT: Yeah, so add your constitution modifier.

03:06:48.160 --> 03:06:49.210
TRAVIS: (laughs) Yeah.

03:06:49.210 --> 03:06:52.850
LAURA: 19 for the first. And a natural one for the
second.

03:06:52.850 --> 03:06:54.480
MATT: Yeah, no, that's faded, sorry.

03:06:54.480 --> 03:06:59.030
LAURA: Okay, cool. Okay, so--

03:06:59.030 --> 03:07:03.260
MATT: Actually, Percy, I need you to make a
concentration check as well.

03:07:03.260 --> 03:07:05.200
I need to get better at that.

03:07:05.200 --> 03:07:10.000
LAURA: I guess for my-- Jesus Christ.

03:07:10.000 --> 03:07:12.690
MATT: Two, one for each slam.

03:07:12.690 --> 03:07:14.210
TALIESIN: It's a constitution?

03:07:14.210 --> 03:07:16.920
MATT: Yeah, add your constitution modifier.

03:07:16.920 --> 03:07:17.910
TALIESIN: Ten.

03:07:17.910 --> 03:07:19.460
MATT: Yeah, so the Hex has also faded, sorry.

03:07:19.460 --> 03:07:20.640
TALIESIN: Damn it.

03:07:20.640 --> 03:07:26.290
LAURA: Fuck. I guess I'm gonna Hail of Thorns
him.

03:07:26.290 --> 03:07:28.300
MATT: Okay, go for it.

03:07:28.300 --> 03:07:29.920
TRAVIS: Well, tit-for-tat, give him something
else.

03:07:29.920 --> 03:07:30.760
LAURA: Right?

03:07:30.760 --> 03:07:31.970
TALIESIN: Just hurt him, just hurt him.

03:07:31.970 --> 03:07:33.080
SAM: Yeah, man.

03:07:33.080 --> 03:07:35.790
LAURA: Okay, so that's a regular attack.

03:07:35.790 --> 03:07:37.390
MATT: What level are you casting it at?

03:07:37.390 --> 03:07:39.720
LAURA: Oh! Right, oh, I can cast it at higher.

03:07:39.720 --> 03:07:40.900
MATT: Yes you can.

03:07:40.900 --> 03:07:42.800
LAURA: I'm gonna cast it at a level four.
Fuck it.

03:07:42.800 --> 03:07:45.170
MATT: Go for it! So go ahead and roll the attack.

03:07:45.170 --> 03:07:51.690
LAURA: Okay, that is... I roll a d20 and then I
add what? My spell attack bonus?

03:07:51.690 --> 03:07:54.630
MATT: No, it's just a regular attack, and if it
hits-- because you cast the spell as a bonus

03:07:54.630 --> 03:07:57.400
action onto an arrow, release the arrow,
and if it hits--

03:07:57.400 --> 03:07:58.830
LAURA: 27.

03:07:58.830 --> 03:08:04.670
MATT: 27 hits. So you do damage for the arrow,
plus an additional 4d10 damage, yeah.

03:08:04.670 --> 03:08:05.980
LAURA: 4d10.

03:08:05.980 --> 03:08:07.150
LIAM: Girl!

03:08:07.150 --> 03:08:12.680
LAURA: That's good, that's good, that's good.
Oh, that's good, okay. 17 for the actual hit.

03:08:12.680 --> 03:08:13.640
MATT: Nice.

03:08:13.640 --> 03:08:15.740
LAURA: And then an additional 4d10?

03:08:15.740 --> 03:08:16.640
MATT: Yep.

03:08:16.640 --> 03:08:28.150
LAURA: Wow. That's awesome. Hopefully these will
be good. 20 additional.

03:08:28.150 --> 03:08:32.290
MATT: 20 points of damage to him. Nice. As you
release the arrow, it sticks into his chest.

03:08:32.290 --> 03:08:35.990
(chuckles) "You will--" (explosion sound)

03:08:35.990 --> 03:08:38.440
It just
bursts in his chest, these thorns go spraying into

03:08:38.440 --> 03:08:42.340
him and the nearby area, just like a pipe bomb
went off in his chest, and he's just like

03:08:42.340 --> 03:08:49.820
(gasping roar of pain). All right. And do you want
to move or stay where you are?

03:08:49.820 --> 03:08:52.180
LAURA: I'm gonna stay where I am.

03:08:52.180 --> 03:08:52.960
MATT: Okay.

03:08:52.960 --> 03:08:55.330
LAURA: But I'm gonna hold onto that tree.

03:08:55.330 --> 03:08:58.660
MATT: Okay, you grapple onto that tree. End of
your turn, he's gonna use his last legendary

03:08:58.660 --> 03:09:08.570
action to make one attack with Fenthras back at
you out of anger. That is a 25.

03:09:08.570 --> 03:09:09.920
LAURA: That hits me.

03:09:09.920 --> 03:09:11.710
MATT: All right.

03:09:11.710 --> 03:09:14.170
SAM: I'm gonna actually, wait, can I Cutting Words
that?

03:09:14.170 --> 03:09:16.120
MATT: Sure. What are you gonna do? What do you
say?

03:09:16.120 --> 03:09:17.140
MARISHA: C'mon, c'mon.

03:09:17.140 --> 03:09:23.330
SAM: I'm gonna insult him. I'm gonna call him a
(clears throat)

03:09:23.330 --> 03:09:28.560
"Oi, you fobbing elf-skinned flapdragon!

03:09:28.560 --> 03:09:36.470
"You paunchy ill-breeding lewdster! You
unmuscled reeling ripe mumblenews!"

03:09:36.470 --> 03:09:38.700
Shakespeare insult generator.

03:09:38.700 --> 03:09:40.300
MATT: That is fantastic.

03:09:40.300 --> 03:09:42.650
TRAVIS: That's unbelievable.

03:09:42.650 --> 03:09:44.020
MATT: That's really quite good.

03:09:44.020 --> 03:09:46.450
LAURA: He's really old, so that really means a lot
to him.

03:09:46.450 --> 03:09:50.390
MATT: Unfortunately, they fall on deaf ears,
he's beyond 60 feet from you,

03:09:50.390 --> 03:09:52.060
and doesn't hear the insult.

03:09:52.060 --> 03:09:54.970
SAM: What? I thought the roof was only like 45
feet up, 50 feet up!

03:09:54.970 --> 03:09:56.630
MATT: But you're over there.

03:09:56.630 --> 03:10:02.340
SAM: I yelled it really loud.

03:10:02.340 --> 03:10:04.860
TALIESIN: Did you use the cone? No, you can't use
the-- oh, you could use the cone.

03:10:04.860 --> 03:10:12.460
MATT: Just on the cusp. At an angle, let me see
here, 'cause he's about 55 feet from you and then

03:10:12.460 --> 03:10:16.030
is 40 feet up, yeah, at the angle, he's just out
of range.

03:10:16.030 --> 03:10:19.640
MARISHA: Aw, Pythagoras's theorem, man, c'mon,
that's right at 60, right?

03:10:19.640 --> 03:10:21.750
MATT: Just misses him.

03:10:21.750 --> 03:10:26.420
MARISHA: A-squared plus b-squared equals
c-squared? C'mon.

03:10:26.420 --> 03:10:28.020
SAM: No problem.

03:10:28.020 --> 03:10:31.670
MATT: Yeah, he's just out of the range. You shout
it, it echoes, it was a great insult, but he's too

03:10:31.670 --> 03:10:33.440
focused--

03:10:33.440 --> 03:10:34.350
LAURA: Fuck.

03:10:34.350 --> 03:10:38.540
MATT: -- and looses the arrow. It manages to catch
you for...

03:10:38.540 --> 03:10:43.960
TALIESIN: Oh, don't make that face.

03:10:43.960 --> 03:10:46.580
MATT: 15 points of piercing damage and one point
of lightning damage.

03:10:46.580 --> 03:10:48.160
LAURA: Okay. Okay.

03:10:48.160 --> 03:10:49.060
MARISHA: Still up?

03:10:49.060 --> 03:10:50.130
LAURA: I'm good.

03:10:50.130 --> 03:10:51.000
TALIESIN: Ish.

03:10:51.000 --> 03:10:52.080
LAURA: Ish.

03:10:52.080 --> 03:10:53.500
TALIESIN: Esque.

03:10:53.500 --> 03:10:55.600
MATT: All right. Up at the top of the round.
Vax, you're up.

03:10:55.600 --> 03:10:59.090
LIAM: All right, I think from where I'm standing
I'm close enough to see that Keyleth is absolutely

03:10:59.090 --> 03:11:01.760
mauling the tree, she's right on top of it,
right?

03:11:01.760 --> 03:11:03.290
MATT: That appears to be the case, yes.

03:11:03.290 --> 03:11:04.790
LIAM: With double speed I can get there, yeah?

03:11:04.790 --> 03:11:06.410
MATT: Yes, you can.

03:11:06.410 --> 03:11:09.880
LIAM: All right, so I'm gonna flit across the
floor, come up right behind Keyleth, shoot right

03:11:09.880 --> 03:11:14.600
around the side of her and stab up and in,
one-two-three.

03:11:14.600 --> 03:11:17.320
MATT: Go for it.

03:11:17.320 --> 03:11:22.080
LIAM: First attack is a 28.

03:11:22.080 --> 03:11:23.850
MATT: 28 hits.

03:11:23.850 --> 03:11:26.560
LIAM: Second attack is a 29.

03:11:26.560 --> 03:11:27.670
MATT: Hits.

03:11:27.670 --> 03:11:29.860
LIAM: And the third attack is a 26.

03:11:29.860 --> 03:11:32.170
MATT: Hits, all three hit.

03:11:32.170 --> 03:11:43.190
LIAM: Sneak attack on the first. Two plus six is
eight... 30.

03:11:43.190 --> 03:11:44.360
MATT: 30 points.

03:11:44.360 --> 03:11:49.210
LIAM: For the first attack, second attack does
seven, and the third attack does ten.

03:11:49.210 --> 03:11:51.180
MATT: Ten, all righty.

03:11:51.180 --> 03:11:52.660
LIAM: Ten and seven.

03:11:52.660 --> 03:11:56.180
MATT: You rush up from the side, seeing the
inferno engulfing the creature as it's shrieking

03:11:56.180 --> 03:12:00.320
in pain, you rush up and just start stabbing it
repeatedly, throwing your dagger up into the

03:12:00.320 --> 03:12:05.010
various exposed parts of its bark form. You can
see it's actually breaking apart from the inside.

03:12:05.010 --> 03:12:07.790
It's still holding itself together, but it's
looking pretty rough.

03:12:07.790 --> 03:12:11.550
LIAM: Am I burning at all, as I just came up next
to flamey here?

03:12:11.550 --> 03:12:13.760
MATT: What's the radius, Keyleth?

03:12:13.760 --> 03:12:15.120
LAURA: On fire damage.

03:12:15.120 --> 03:12:17.900
MATT: What's the radius to take damage? When they
come within a certain area of you?

03:12:17.900 --> 03:12:20.410
MARISHA: No, it's when I'm--

03:12:20.410 --> 03:12:21.800
TALIESIN: Sharing space.

03:12:21.800 --> 03:12:28.560
MARISHA: Five feet, maybe? Wait. I think it's when
I'm sharing space.

03:12:28.560 --> 03:12:30.500
LIAM: Because that came up in the past, being
around her.

03:12:30.500 --> 03:12:32.660
MATT: No, you're right, it doesn't affect,
you're fine, you're fine.

03:12:32.660 --> 03:12:33.490
LIAM: Woo!

03:12:33.490 --> 03:12:37.130
MATT: You're good. You can feel the heat,
it's emanating from it, definitely. All right.

03:12:37.130 --> 03:12:38.780
That end your turn, Vax?

03:12:38.780 --> 03:12:39.480
LIAM: Yeah.

03:12:39.480 --> 03:12:40.910
MATT: Percy, you're up.

03:12:40.910 --> 03:12:43.100
TALIESIN: I just watch this. I put my gun down,
pull out my sword,

03:12:43.100 --> 03:12:44.740
and just start hacking at the tree.

03:12:44.740 --> 03:12:47.140
MATT: Go for it.

03:12:47.140 --> 03:12:48.670
SAM: What happened?

03:12:48.670 --> 03:12:50.830
TALIESIN: That's 25.

03:12:50.830 --> 03:12:52.490
MATT: 25 hits.

03:12:52.490 --> 03:12:54.730
TALIESIN: 23.

03:12:54.730 --> 03:12:57.700
MATT: Hits.

03:12:57.700 --> 03:12:59.820
TALIESIN: And 27.

03:12:59.820 --> 03:13:06.890
MATT: Hits. All three hit.

03:13:06.890 --> 03:13:10.390
(A dice clings loudly against a glass.)

03:13:10.390 --> 03:13:15.220
TALIESIN: That's a thing that happens now.
Okay, and so that's...

03:13:15.220 --> 03:13:17.050
(Travis elbows the set, which makes a loud thump
noise)

03:13:17.050 --> 03:13:20.570
TRAVIS: Jesus. Thunder strikes outside the tree.

03:13:20.570 --> 03:13:21.930
LIAM: What was that?

03:13:21.930 --> 03:13:23.710
LAURA: That was Travis hitting the side of the
room.

03:13:23.710 --> 03:13:26.280
TRAVIS: I'm too big for this world.

03:13:26.280 --> 03:13:28.000
TALIESIN: 35 points of slashing damage.

03:13:28.000 --> 03:13:29.380
MATT: On the first hit? Rolled together?

03:13:29.380 --> 03:13:30.330
TALIESIN: All three together.

03:13:30.330 --> 03:13:31.250
MATT: I was like, holy shit.

03:13:31.250 --> 03:13:32.300
TALIESIN: Yeah, I just went thump-thump-thump.

03:13:32.300 --> 03:13:33.550
MATT: Yeah.

03:13:33.550 --> 03:13:35.100
TRAVIS: You're a greater barbarian than I am.

03:13:35.100 --> 03:13:38.230
MATT: As it's on fire and shrieking, you pull the
sword out and, seeing the wounds that Vax already

03:13:38.230 --> 03:13:43.920
left open, you leap up off of one knee, leap up,
spin it around, and jam it into the center where

03:13:43.920 --> 03:13:46.680
you see the bark is actually splitting, and with
that, you look down at Keyleth, and together,

03:13:46.680 --> 03:13:50.560
she forces outward as you dig down with the
blade. The treant actually splits up the middle

03:13:50.560 --> 03:13:55.880
and then just falls to two sides and begins to
burn from the inside.

03:13:55.880 --> 03:13:57.130
SAM: It's looking pretty rough.

03:13:57.130 --> 03:14:00.420
(All laugh.)

03:14:00.420 --> 03:14:01.850
MARISHA: Is he dead? He's dead.

03:14:01.850 --> 03:14:02.920
LAURA: That's good, that's good.

03:14:02.920 --> 03:14:04.410
MATT: He is dead and on the ground there,
just burning.

03:14:04.410 --> 03:14:06.640
SAM: Loot the body. Might get some acorns.

03:14:06.640 --> 03:14:07.780
LAURA: So much lumber.

03:14:07.780 --> 03:14:09.810
MARISHA: Let's make s'mores after this!

03:14:09.810 --> 03:14:11.490
MATT: Percy, do you want to move or do you stay
where you are?

03:14:11.490 --> 03:14:17.330
TALIESIN: I'm going to move, I'm going to charge
north, just to split the group up a bit.

03:14:17.330 --> 03:14:18.430
MATT: Over here?

03:14:18.430 --> 03:14:22.730
TALIESIN: Yeah, actually if I can hug the edge a
little closer--

03:14:22.730 --> 03:14:24.470
MATT: Like there, or around this way, you mean?

03:14:24.470 --> 03:14:26.380
TALIESIN: Around that way, and then ten feet away
from the wall.

03:14:26.380 --> 03:14:29.170
MATT: Ten feet away.

03:14:29.170 --> 03:14:33.390
TALIESIN: And then, bonus action to put my mask on
in case anything more gassy happens.

03:14:33.390 --> 03:14:34.330
MATT: Okay.

03:14:34.330 --> 03:14:39.500
TALIESIN: And then I've got a grit left,
so fuck it, I'm gonna-- oh no, because I can't

03:14:39.500 --> 03:14:43.370
switch weapons fast enough. Never mind. I'm gonna
call it.

03:14:43.370 --> 03:14:44.990
LIAM: I have a question, and I could be wrong--

03:14:44.990 --> 03:14:45.890
MATT: Yes?

03:14:45.890 --> 03:14:47.720
LIAM: I thought Percy gave me that mask.

03:14:47.720 --> 03:14:49.850
TALIESIN: I took it back from you last game.

03:14:49.850 --> 03:14:51.190
MATT: He did.

03:14:51.190 --> 03:14:52.610
LIAM: Oh right, I forgot.

03:14:52.610 --> 03:14:54.210
TALIESIN: 'Cause you weren't there.

03:14:54.210 --> 03:14:56.820
MATT: You weren't there and he was walking through
the swamp, yeah.

03:14:56.820 --> 03:14:58.050
LIAM: That is true.

03:14:58.050 --> 03:15:00.630
TALIESIN: Yeah, you can have it back if you want,
I just took it for the swamp.

03:15:00.630 --> 03:15:03.240
LIAM: Nah, it looks good on you.

03:15:03.240 --> 03:15:05.110
MATT: It's now count 20.

03:15:05.110 --> 03:15:10.000
LAURA: Any sign of umber-werewolfy--

03:15:10.000 --> 03:15:10.950
TRAVIS: Ukurat.

03:15:10.950 --> 03:15:12.170
LAURA: Ukurat?

03:15:12.170 --> 03:15:24.350
MATT: So. First you watch as a low mist begins to
slowly filter into the room. Everyone in this

03:15:24.350 --> 03:15:29.160
radius here, it's gonna be Keyleth, Vax, Percy,
and Vex,

03:15:29.160 --> 03:15:32.200
I need you all to make a wisdom saving throw.

03:15:32.200 --> 03:15:34.350
SAM: Oh.

03:15:34.350 --> 03:15:35.400
MARISHA: Wisdom.

03:15:35.400 --> 03:15:36.800
MATT: Yes, as the fog fills the--

03:15:36.800 --> 03:15:38.300
LAURA: Natural 20!

03:15:38.300 --> 03:15:39.430
TALIESIN: 19.

03:15:39.430 --> 03:15:40.550
SAM: Wow.

03:15:40.550 --> 03:15:41.610
LIAM: Best wisdom roll of my life.

03:15:41.610 --> 03:15:43.120
SAM: What'd you get, Liam?

03:15:43.120 --> 03:15:44.650
LIAM: 21, which was huge for me.

03:15:44.650 --> 03:15:45.570
MATT: 21.

03:15:45.570 --> 03:15:46.680
LAURA: Natural 20.

03:15:46.680 --> 03:15:49.080
MARISHA: 18 plus 11, so 29.

03:15:49.080 --> 03:15:50.350
TALIESIN: 23.

03:15:50.350 --> 03:15:52.080
MATT: Jesus Christ.

03:15:52.080 --> 03:15:53.530
TRAVIS: It's just on that smog thing.

03:15:53.530 --> 03:15:57.700
MATT: You feel like the fog as it fills your
senses begins to cloud your mind and your vision

03:15:57.700 --> 03:16:01.550
begins to blur, but then you shake it from your
mind and focus in and it has no effect on you.

03:16:01.550 --> 03:16:03.670
LAURA: Yes!

03:16:03.670 --> 03:16:08.760
MATT: Lot of fucking help that did. At which
point, the area that it closed before, where you

03:16:08.760 --> 03:16:13.370
guys entered, you hear this loud creaking sound
and the breaking of wood and bark.

03:16:13.370 --> 03:16:14.430
TALIESIN: Yeah!

03:16:14.430 --> 03:16:18.060
MATT: Suddenly you watch as it's forced open as
these two feral claws (growls).

03:16:18.060 --> 03:16:20.820
(All cheer.)

03:16:20.820 --> 03:16:28.810
MATT: And Ukurat darts inside from the entrance.
Looks around, looks up. "Where's my quarry?"

03:16:28.810 --> 03:16:31.050
LAURA: Up, up, up!

03:16:31.050 --> 03:16:37.580
MATT: Looks up and sees Sondur. "So be it."
And begins jumping onto the wall and climbing

03:16:37.580 --> 03:16:40.600
and running up the side of the actual--

03:16:40.600 --> 03:16:42.230
TALIESIN: Parkour.

03:16:42.230 --> 03:16:43.780
MATT: Parkour, indeed.

03:16:43.780 --> 03:16:47.940
SAM: You could cut me out first! Okay, just go,
it's okay.

03:16:47.940 --> 03:16:51.240
MATT: Gets up and runs, and he only manages to get
just up to

03:16:51.240 --> 03:16:55.200
where we'll say where Sondur is there
in his turn.

03:16:55.200 --> 03:16:56.720
LAURA: Look at how big they both are.

03:16:56.720 --> 03:17:00.070
MATT: But he's now right up in the face of Sondur.
Sondur's like, (grunts).

03:17:00.070 --> 03:17:01.720
SAM: Sic 'em.

03:17:01.720 --> 03:17:04.720
MATT: All right, that ends his turn, 20, Grog,
you're up.

03:17:04.720 --> 03:17:09.010
TRAVIS: I've been so taken out of this fight,
it's driving me crazy. I'm hanging from vines,

03:17:09.010 --> 03:17:12.470
I see Wolfman come up, I'm not gonna be left out
of this.

03:17:12.470 --> 03:17:15.240
Can I try and Tarzan my way over into the
fray?

03:17:15.240 --> 03:17:17.520
All: Yes!

03:17:17.520 --> 03:17:21.040
MATT: Yes. This will be the majority of your
movement and your action to do so.

03:17:21.040 --> 03:17:22.610
TRAVIS: Just get me there, baby.

03:17:22.610 --> 03:17:25.580
MATT: All right. So you, go ahead and make an
athletics check.

03:17:25.580 --> 03:17:27.240
TRAVIS: Okay. With advantage.

03:17:27.240 --> 03:17:32.420
MATT: With advantage. At disadvantage because of
your skill check, so just regular attack.

03:17:32.420 --> 03:17:33.500
LAURA: No.

03:17:33.500 --> 03:17:34.500
MATT: What'd you roll?

03:17:34.500 --> 03:17:36.920
TRAVIS: A one.

03:17:36.920 --> 03:17:40.560
TALIESIN: Watch out for that tree.

03:17:40.560 --> 03:17:43.970
MATT: Getting your momentum, you pull back and
your feet catch the edge, and you push off,

03:17:43.970 --> 03:17:47.150
and you swing out, and as you reach for the next
vine (snapping sound).

03:17:47.150 --> 03:17:49.130
MARISHA: Oh my god.

03:17:49.130 --> 03:17:51.250
LAURA: Ohh. Boo.

03:17:51.250 --> 03:17:58.050
MATT: You plummet to the ground. That puts you,
you take

03:17:58.050 --> 03:18:02.370
eight points of bludgeoning damage and fall prone.

03:18:02.370 --> 03:18:06.600
TRAVIS: Okay. And prone. That's probably more
insulting.

03:18:06.600 --> 03:18:08.810
LIAM: Are you halfway done yet, Groggy?

03:18:08.810 --> 03:18:13.730
TRAVIS: Because it fails, does that still take up
all my action? All my whole thing?

03:18:13.730 --> 03:18:16.320
MATT: I mean, you still have your bonus action.

03:18:16.320 --> 03:18:17.870
TRAVIS: To get up?

03:18:17.870 --> 03:18:21.360
MATT: No, half your movement, but yeah, you won't
be able to this turn, so.

03:18:21.360 --> 03:18:23.300
TRAVIS: I'll cry a little.

03:18:23.300 --> 03:18:26.130
LAURA: Do you have any other bonus, anything you
can do for a bonus action?

03:18:26.130 --> 03:18:28.500
TRAVIS: Do I keep my rage, because I fell and took
damage?

03:18:28.500 --> 03:18:34.200
MATT: Uh. Let me double-check the specifics for
the rage here, if it's, just to make sure.

03:18:34.200 --> 03:18:36.140
TRAVIS: I think it has to be an attack.

03:18:36.140 --> 03:18:37.780
MARISHA: I mean, he's gotta be pretty angry.

03:18:37.780 --> 03:18:38.990
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'd be angry.

03:18:38.990 --> 03:18:39.900
MARISHA: I'd be angry.

03:18:39.900 --> 03:18:41.570
LAURA: Yeah, I'd think that would piss him the
fuck off.

03:18:41.570 --> 03:18:42.790
MATT: No, you took damage, so it maintains.

03:18:42.790 --> 03:18:43.820
(All cheer.)

03:18:43.820 --> 03:18:45.530
MATT: You're really angry now, you're like "Fuck
this!"

03:18:45.530 --> 03:18:46.860
TRAVIS: I'm good.

03:18:46.860 --> 03:18:51.380
MATT: All right. So. That ends Grog's turn.
It is now Sondur's turn. Sondur, who is looking

03:18:51.380 --> 03:19:00.090
at this sudden large werewolf entity that shows up
out of nowhere knows he has to get away from this,

03:19:00.090 --> 03:19:07.350
and is gonna go ahead and attempt to begin by
vine-walking into the, well he heals a little bit

03:19:07.350 --> 03:19:13.320
first, sorry. And then he's gonna go ahead and
vine-walk into the wall. Ukurat does get an attack

03:19:13.320 --> 03:19:24.410
of opportunity on him. That does hit, a 27.
So he takes 15 points of slashing damage.

03:19:24.410 --> 03:19:32.600
And vanishes back into the wall and emerges on
this side here.

03:19:32.600 --> 03:19:35.030
MARISHA: Exactly where Grog was? That's cool.

03:19:35.030 --> 03:19:36.160
MATT: Over here.

03:19:36.160 --> 03:19:39.910
LAURA: So close to where Grog was. Damn it.

03:19:39.910 --> 03:19:43.610
MATT: From there, he's gonna go ahead and make
three attacks with Fenthras.

03:19:43.610 --> 03:19:47.010
First one's gonna be at you, Vex.

03:19:47.010 --> 03:19:48.960
SAM: My God, better miss.

03:19:48.960 --> 03:19:51.090
MATT: That is a 20.

03:19:51.090 --> 03:19:52.900
LAURA: 20 is my armor class.

03:19:52.900 --> 03:19:59.320
MATT: Aw. You suffer 15 points of piercing damage
and

03:19:59.320 --> 03:20:02.060
four points of thunder damage, or, uh,
lightning damage.

03:20:02.060 --> 03:20:03.300
LAURA: 19?

03:20:03.300 --> 03:20:04.670
MATT: 19.

03:20:04.670 --> 03:20:07.280
LAURA: Cool.

03:20:07.280 --> 03:20:08.530
SAM: You're still alive!

03:20:08.530 --> 03:20:09.700
LAURA: I'm still alive.

03:20:09.700 --> 03:20:11.570
SAM: Wow. That's impressive.

03:20:11.570 --> 03:20:14.190
MATT: Shhnk. The first arrow hits you and you take
the damage and lean against the tree, and you're

03:20:14.190 --> 03:20:17.960
still standing. He goes, (angry roar), pulls back
and takes another shot.

03:20:17.960 --> 03:20:19.130
TALIESIN: God damn it.

03:20:19.130 --> 03:20:25.110
LAURA: Can I shout out, "I was wrong! Uh...
you're so dreamy!"

03:20:25.110 --> 03:20:28.600
MATT: Same exact roll, 20, hits you again.

03:20:28.600 --> 03:20:29.800
SAM: Damn it.

03:20:29.800 --> 03:20:41.060
MATT: Natural nine on that one. This one is going
to be... that is eight plus three, eight points of

03:20:41.060 --> 03:20:43.030
piercing damage plus three points of lightning,
so.

03:20:43.030 --> 03:20:45.660
MARISHA: She's down.

03:20:45.660 --> 03:20:52.180
MATT: With that, Vex falls unconscious onto the
ground. With his third and final shot of the

03:20:52.180 --> 03:21:01.160
round, he's gonna look down at, I'm gonna say at
Percy, who's right below. Take a shot at Percy.

03:21:01.160 --> 03:21:02.460
Natural 20.

03:21:02.460 --> 03:21:04.080
MARISHA: What? What?

03:21:04.080 --> 03:21:05.270
TRAVIS: Wow.

03:21:05.270 --> 03:21:07.050
MATT: It works against you, sometimes.

03:21:07.050 --> 03:21:07.990
TALIESIN: Bastard.

03:21:07.990 --> 03:21:13.480
MARISHA: Fucker's having a good round.

03:21:13.480 --> 03:21:15.580
MATT: 23 points of piercing damage and four points
of lightning.

03:21:15.580 --> 03:21:17.470
TALIESIN: I'm gonna do a missile snare.

03:21:17.470 --> 03:21:18.170
MATT: Okay.

03:21:18.170 --> 03:21:19.310
LAURA: Yes!

03:21:19.310 --> 03:21:20.780
TALIESIN: 23 points of piercing damage?

03:21:20.780 --> 03:21:21.710
MATT: Correct.

03:21:21.710 --> 03:21:27.940
TALIESIN: That's gonna be 13 points of piercing
damage.

03:21:27.940 --> 03:21:30.190
MATT: Okay, plus four lightning, so 17.

03:21:30.190 --> 03:21:35.940
TALIESIN: And can I use that four, I'm gonna take
that four lightning, can that hit the glove?

03:21:35.940 --> 03:21:38.310
MATT: We can say you bring up the glove and it
does--

03:21:38.310 --> 03:21:39.990
TALIESIN: I mean, like, hitting, so--

03:21:39.990 --> 03:21:43.860
MATT: Yeah, it takes the damage, but you kind of
bring it up instinctually and it does seem to rev

03:21:43.860 --> 03:21:45.130
some charge to it.

03:21:45.130 --> 03:21:47.050
TALIESIN: All right, so that's rolling now,
that's in play.

03:21:47.050 --> 03:21:47.780
MATT: There you go.

03:21:47.780 --> 03:21:48.790
TALIESIN: Thank you.

03:21:48.790 --> 03:21:55.450
MATT: All right. That ends his turn. The treants
are gone. Let's see. That's gonna bring us to

03:21:55.450 --> 03:21:57.790
Scanlan and Keyleth.

03:21:57.790 --> 03:22:00.400
SAM: You wanna do--

03:22:00.400 --> 03:22:04.660
MARISHA: I don't know if I can be grappled.

03:22:04.660 --> 03:22:06.800
We can Dimension Door, though, I can try and take
you--

03:22:06.800 --> 03:22:10.870
SAM: Nah, I can't do that to you.

03:22:10.870 --> 03:22:14.250
MARISHA: I can try coming to get you undone.

03:22:14.250 --> 03:22:16.950
SAM: I can't Dimension Door you.

03:22:16.950 --> 03:22:19.320
MARISHA: No, I mean, I mean burn you from the
vines.

03:22:19.320 --> 03:22:20.320
SAM: Oh.

03:22:20.320 --> 03:22:24.140
MARISHA: Like get you ungrappled. I don't know if,
so, question.

03:22:24.140 --> 03:22:29.910
Could Bigby's Hand toss a fire
elemental's ass?

03:22:29.910 --> 03:22:33.610
MATT: Yeah, I mean, you have some sort of
physicality to you,

03:22:33.610 --> 03:22:36.790
it's just somewhat fluid in
its structure.

03:22:36.790 --> 03:22:40.940
MARISHA: So it's like a magical hand meets magical
fire elemental could kinda work?

03:22:40.940 --> 03:22:42.280
MATT: Yeah.

03:22:42.280 --> 03:22:43.520
TRAVIS: Like a Molotov cocktail.

03:22:43.520 --> 03:22:46.930
MARISHA: All right. Here's what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna go over to Scanlan and I'm gonna burn

03:22:46.930 --> 03:22:49.240
the vines around him that are holding him in.

03:22:49.240 --> 03:22:50.230
MATT: Okay.

03:22:50.230 --> 03:22:51.510
SAM: Is that your action, though?

03:22:51.510 --> 03:22:52.840
MATT: That would be your action, yeah.

03:22:52.840 --> 03:22:53.880
MARISHA: That's my action?

03:22:53.880 --> 03:22:56.420
SAM: Don't do that, then. You need to, no,
you need to attack--

03:22:56.420 --> 03:22:58.230
LAURA: Yeah, don't use your action to--

03:22:58.230 --> 03:23:00.080
SAM: Fuck that. I'm fine.

03:23:00.080 --> 03:23:02.890
MATT: So as you run up to Scanlan, he's telling
you this. What are you doing?

03:23:02.890 --> 03:23:05.500
SAM: Leave me, I'm fine, this is cozy.

03:23:05.500 --> 03:23:12.370
MARISHA: I go, "Okay." And I hold my action until
I wait for Scanlan. I wait for Scanlan.

03:23:12.370 --> 03:23:15.200
MATT: Okay, so you move over there and you hold
your action waiting for Scanlan to...

03:23:15.200 --> 03:23:17.250
MARISHA: To--

03:23:17.250 --> 03:23:18.540
SAM: To throw you.

03:23:18.540 --> 03:23:19.550
MARISHA: To throw me.

03:23:19.550 --> 03:23:21.480
MATT: Okay. All right. Scanlan.

03:23:21.480 --> 03:23:29.200
SAM: I will heal Vex with my bonus action first,
right, she's still within range, yes?

03:23:29.200 --> 03:23:29.980
MATT: Yeah.

03:23:29.980 --> 03:23:33.710
SAM: (singing) I'm... I don't know.

03:23:33.710 --> 03:23:40.600
I'm giving you everything,
all that health will bring, this is true.

03:23:40.600 --> 03:23:42.400
TRAVIS: Fucking Spice Girls.

03:23:42.400 --> 03:23:43.930
LAURA: Is that Spice Girls?

03:23:43.930 --> 03:23:50.200
SAM: (singing) And all I want from you is a
promise you will kiss me forever.

03:23:50.200 --> 03:23:51.830
MARISHA: It was girl power that healed you.

03:23:51.830 --> 03:23:53.080
LAURA: Girl power healed me. I feel it.

03:23:53.080 --> 03:23:55.230
MARISHA: I'm feeling it, yeah. Spice magic.

03:23:55.230 --> 03:23:57.670
SAM: (singing) I'm - I'm! - giving you
everything, all that health I bring, yeah--

03:23:57.670 --> 03:24:02.390
All right, so that's at level one.

03:24:02.390 --> 03:24:06.360
MATT: So 1d4 plus six.

03:24:06.360 --> 03:24:07.540
SAM: Eight.

03:24:07.540 --> 03:24:08.440
LAURA: Awesome.

03:24:08.440 --> 03:24:11.060
MATT: So you heal eight. You come to consciousness
again on the ground, face-down, you can see the

03:24:11.060 --> 03:24:13.170
sludge sort of filling in your nostrils--

03:24:13.170 --> 03:24:14.990
LAURA: (gasps) Spice Girls?

03:24:14.990 --> 03:24:16.790
MARISHA: This is my jam.

03:24:16.790 --> 03:24:21.450
SAM: And then I will cast Bigby's Hand.

03:24:21.450 --> 03:24:24.310
MATT: All righty. Next to Keyleth.

03:24:24.310 --> 03:24:27.490
SAM: Next to Keyleth, and cup her gently.

03:24:27.490 --> 03:24:29.720
MARISHA: I turn into a fireball myself.

03:24:29.720 --> 03:24:31.570
MATT: Okay.

03:24:31.570 --> 03:24:36.010
SAM: And just sort of cup and fling.

03:24:36.010 --> 03:24:37.610
TRAVIS: Cup that ball.

03:24:37.610 --> 03:24:38.750
MARISHA: Very gently.

03:24:38.750 --> 03:24:40.390
TALIESIN: As you've cupped so many before.

03:24:40.390 --> 03:24:41.400
SAM: Yes.

03:24:41.400 --> 03:24:43.450
MATT: Okay. Roll a d20 plus eight.

03:24:43.450 --> 03:24:45.190
SAM: What is that for?

03:24:45.190 --> 03:24:49.100
MATT: That is the strength of Bigby's Hand
throwing the elemental.

03:24:49.100 --> 03:24:51.050
TALIESIN: (singing) I believe in you, you can do
the thing.

03:24:51.050 --> 03:24:52.040
SAM: 24.

03:24:52.040 --> 03:25:01.610
MATT: 24. You lob the elemental in a wide arc.
It makes it most of the way, and then falls past

03:25:01.610 --> 03:25:08.150
and lands on the ground there. You are by him.
Not quite a hit on that one, unfortunately.

03:25:08.150 --> 03:25:10.240
MARISHA: God damn it!

03:25:10.240 --> 03:25:13.850
MATT: But you do take five points of bludgeoning
damage from the fall.

03:25:13.850 --> 03:25:15.920
LAURA: Ooh, nice.

03:25:15.920 --> 03:25:21.320
MATT: A 25 or higher would have got to him.
He's a long ways away!

03:25:21.320 --> 03:25:24.660
MARISHA: Five points halved, or was that--

03:25:24.660 --> 03:25:25.820
MATT: That's halved.

03:25:25.820 --> 03:25:28.040
SAM: Hey, you've still got your attack.

03:25:28.040 --> 03:25:29.040
MARISHA: Did I?

03:25:29.040 --> 03:25:30.210
TRAVIS: Yeah, you've been thrown.

03:25:30.210 --> 03:25:34.750
MATT: You held your action, so you can still use
your action to do something if you can.

03:25:34.750 --> 03:25:37.240
TRAVIS: Can you?

03:25:37.240 --> 03:25:38.320
MARISHA: Can I--

03:25:38.320 --> 03:25:39.820
SAM: Just throw a fireball?

03:25:39.820 --> 03:25:41.030
MARISHA: I can't do that.

03:25:41.030 --> 03:25:42.360
SAM: Aren't you Johnny Storm?

03:25:42.360 --> 03:25:43.960
MARISHA: I gotta be there.

03:25:43.960 --> 03:25:45.670
MATT: Yeah, it's a melee thing.

03:25:45.670 --> 03:25:48.560
MARISHA: Do I still have any movement?

03:25:48.560 --> 03:25:52.720
MATT: No, just your action. To get through,
I'd say... what's your speed as an elemental?

03:25:52.720 --> 03:25:53.780
MARISHA: 50.

03:25:53.780 --> 03:25:56.960
MATT: 50? It took you 25 to get there, you still
have 25 feet, I would say.

03:25:56.960 --> 03:26:03.890
MARISHA: Can I start climbing 25 feet up the
wall?

03:26:03.890 --> 03:26:06.630
MATT: Make an athletics check.

03:26:06.630 --> 03:26:07.810
MARISHA: Okay.

03:26:07.810 --> 03:26:11.680
MATT: Using the strength of the fire elemental.
Add your strength modifier.

03:26:11.680 --> 03:26:13.520
MARISHA: Not good.

03:26:13.520 --> 03:26:14.360
MATT: What'd you roll?

03:26:14.360 --> 03:26:15.300
MARISHA: Five.

03:26:15.300 --> 03:26:18.770
MATT: Five? You start climbing up, you get maybe
five feet up the wall, but already the impact of

03:26:18.770 --> 03:26:22.580
the fall and most of your round exhausted you for
this one pass.

03:26:22.580 --> 03:26:27.160
MARISHA: Okay, well then I'm gonna take the rest
of my action, I'm just going to angrily slam into

03:26:27.160 --> 03:26:31.010
the tree, and see if I can catch the tree up under
him on fire.

03:26:31.010 --> 03:26:34.950
MATT: Okay, cool. Ending your turn, Keyleth.
Vex, you're up.

03:26:34.950 --> 03:26:36.130
LAURA: I'm up?

03:26:36.130 --> 03:26:38.120
MATT: Yeah, you're conscious, you're on the
ground.

03:26:38.120 --> 03:26:40.380
SAM: Run away.

03:26:40.380 --> 03:26:48.800
LAURA: Uh, oh right, you're on the ground.
Can I, ah, fuck. Okay.

03:26:48.800 --> 03:26:52.650
MATT: Actually, hold on. Sorry, I'm gonna be a
dick here.

03:26:52.650 --> 03:26:53.690
TALIESIN: Really?

03:26:53.690 --> 03:26:56.660
MATT: He's getting his legendary actions back at
the end of Keyleth's turn, watching Scanlan heal

03:26:56.660 --> 03:26:59.830
you, he's gonna use another one of his legendary
actions to take an attack on you as you come to

03:26:59.830 --> 03:27:01.150
consciousness on the ground.

03:27:01.150 --> 03:27:02.670
LAURA: You're an asshole, Sondur.

03:27:02.670 --> 03:27:08.960
MATT: He does attack at disadvantage, though,
because you are prone. That puts him at a 16.

03:27:08.960 --> 03:27:09.840
LAURA: Yay!

03:27:09.840 --> 03:27:11.770
(Loud computer noise in the background.)

03:27:11.770 --> 03:27:15.920
MATT: He fires an arrow, but it hits the ground
inches from your face. You see the spike impact

03:27:15.920 --> 03:27:17.170
and then turn to dust.

03:27:17.170 --> 03:27:18.730
LAURA: Youuu.

03:27:18.730 --> 03:27:20.240
MATT: All right, so take your turn.

03:27:20.240 --> 03:27:24.350
LAURA: Fuck. I'm gonna... it's useless, I can't do
anything.

03:27:24.350 --> 03:27:26.430
SAM: Heal yourself.

03:27:26.430 --> 03:27:30.620
LAURA: I know, but my heal is an action,
and then I can't attack.

03:27:30.620 --> 03:27:32.510
SAM: Do you have any more potions?

03:27:32.510 --> 03:27:37.120
LAURA: Um. I've got, oh, I've got a superior
healing potion,

03:27:37.120 --> 03:27:39.220
that's better than a greater, right?

03:27:39.220 --> 03:27:40.100
MATT: Yeah.

03:27:40.100 --> 03:27:41.620
LAURA: Okay. I'll use that.

03:27:41.620 --> 03:27:43.970
SAM: Is that like a venti?

03:27:43.970 --> 03:27:45.860
MATT: Yeah, that is 8d4 plus eight.

03:27:45.860 --> 03:27:46.900
SAM: Whoa!

03:27:46.900 --> 03:27:47.990
LAURA: Okay.

03:27:47.990 --> 03:27:49.610
MATT: That is one of the pricy healing potions.

03:27:49.610 --> 03:27:50.900
LAURA: Oh, well, okay.

03:27:50.900 --> 03:27:52.780
TALIESIN: Burn it!

03:27:52.780 --> 03:28:02.380
LAURA: Ten...

03:28:02.380 --> 03:28:04.490
MARISHA: That would've been so cool had it
worked.

03:28:04.490 --> 03:28:06.130
TALIESIN: I know. Had it worked.

03:28:06.130 --> 03:28:07.630
LAURA: 20 plus eight... 28.

03:28:07.630 --> 03:28:09.780
MATT: 28 you heal, yeah.

03:28:09.780 --> 03:28:11.930
SAM: That's the last time I listen to you.

03:28:11.930 --> 03:28:13.680
TALIESIN: It was a good plan.

03:28:13.680 --> 03:28:22.610
LAURA: Okay, so I'm back at 36. Okay. I'm gonna
run and duck behind Grog.

03:28:22.610 --> 03:28:26.500
MATT: Well, you get up, which is half your
movement, so you have five, 15 more feet,

03:28:26.500 --> 03:28:27.570
so you can move three squares.

03:28:27.570 --> 03:28:28.830
LAURA: Can I get to Grog?

03:28:28.830 --> 03:28:31.330
MATT: No. You can get there, is the closest you
can get.

03:28:31.330 --> 03:28:37.140
LAURA: All right, I'll go to there and then I
will, I'm gonna Hail of Thorns him again.

03:28:37.140 --> 03:28:39.030
MATT: Okay.

03:28:39.030 --> 03:28:40.040
LAURA: Oh wait, is that--

03:28:40.040 --> 03:28:42.370
MATT: No, your Hail of Thorns is a bonus action,
and you already used your heal spell, so no.

03:28:42.370 --> 03:28:46.410
LAURA: A bonus action, okay. Then I'm gonna,
so I've got two attacks on him.

03:28:46.410 --> 03:28:47.970
MATT: Yeah, you do.

03:28:47.970 --> 03:28:51.220
LAURA: I'm gonna hit him with two attacks.

03:28:51.220 --> 03:28:52.850
MATT: Go for it, roll for the attacks.

03:28:52.850 --> 03:28:55.410
LAURA: I get another flaming bowstring, I've got
one more flaming bowstring.

03:28:55.410 --> 03:28:57.820
MATT: Vax, you're up next, by the way. Go for it.

03:28:57.820 --> 03:28:59.520
SAM: Someday Travis will attack again.

03:28:59.520 --> 03:29:01.070
MATT: The first one is the flaming bowstring.

03:29:01.070 --> 03:29:02.260
TRAVIS: Will he?

03:29:02.260 --> 03:29:03.240
SAM: It's been like eight weeks.

03:29:03.240 --> 03:29:04.960
MATT: 17. The flaming shot unfortunately goes
wide,

03:29:04.960 --> 03:29:07.310
slams into the wall next to him and the
flame curls up.

03:29:07.310 --> 03:29:09.210
LAURA: Okay, so 23 on the second hit.

03:29:09.210 --> 03:29:14.030
MATT: Second hit does hit, so roll damage.

03:29:14.030 --> 03:29:14.990
LAURA: 15.

03:29:14.990 --> 03:29:16.930
MATT: 15 points of damage? All righty.

03:29:16.930 --> 03:29:19.140
LAURA: And then I'm gonna duck behind the tree as
much as I can.

03:29:19.140 --> 03:29:21.300
MATT: Well, that was your full movement was to get
there, so.

03:29:21.300 --> 03:29:24.120
LAURA: Can I not use my full movement to get--

03:29:24.120 --> 03:29:29.630
MATT: To get behind the tree? Hmm, you wouldn't
really have much of a shot at him. I guess he--

03:29:29.630 --> 03:29:31.530
LAURA: Could I have shot him before I moved?

03:29:31.530 --> 03:29:35.970
MATT: You would've been there, suuuure. I normally
don't let that retroactively happen.

03:29:35.970 --> 03:29:37.380
LAURA: Okay okay okay.

03:29:37.380 --> 03:29:40.470
MATT: I'm gonna say you're halfway through.
You're sort of there.

03:29:40.470 --> 03:29:41.660
LAURA: Okay.

03:29:41.660 --> 03:29:45.900
MATT: All right. So. That brings us to Vax.
You're up.

03:29:45.900 --> 03:29:47.470
LIAM: Vex just healed herself, right?

03:29:47.470 --> 03:29:48.530
MATT: She did, yes.

03:29:48.530 --> 03:29:51.000
LIAM: All right. All right. And is he within 60
feet of me?

03:29:51.000 --> 03:29:55.430
MATT: Actually, uh, he is, but at the end of Vex's
turn he's going to take a second shot.

03:29:55.430 --> 03:29:57.310
LAURA: What? What? Why?

03:29:57.310 --> 03:30:00.370
MATT: No, he's gonna use his other two legendary
actions to cast another spell.

03:30:00.370 --> 03:30:01.610
LAURA: He just has so much.

03:30:01.690 --> 03:30:03.780
TALIESIN: Asshole!

03:30:04.020 --> 03:30:05.750
MATT: Angry that she gets up and runs off to the
side, he says,

03:30:05.750 --> 03:30:08.690
"You stay DOWN."

03:30:08.690 --> 03:30:10.710
I need you to make another constitution saving throw.

03:30:10.710 --> 03:30:18.000
LAURA: Jeez Louise, come on, man! Saving throw?

03:30:18.000 --> 03:30:18.820
MATT: Yes.

03:30:18.820 --> 03:30:20.060
LAURA: 19.

03:30:20.060 --> 03:30:22.160
MATT: 19? What's your constitution modifier?

03:30:22.160 --> 03:30:25.590
LAURA: Zero, but I have a +2 on all saving throws
with my ring.

03:30:25.590 --> 03:30:31.990
MATT: That's true. Nice. All righty. That is...

03:30:31.990 --> 03:30:35.050
TALIESIN: God damn it.

03:30:35.050 --> 03:30:38.900
TRAVIS: Yeah, when it's like, when he's playing
fucking Applejacks back there.

03:30:38.900 --> 03:30:45.100
MARISHA: I know.

03:30:45.100 --> 03:30:47.990
LAURA: Is this another Blight, did he cast Blight
again? Motherfuck.

03:30:47.990 --> 03:30:51.560
MATT: 41 points of necrotic damage, halved to 20,
you take 20.

03:30:51.560 --> 03:30:52.410
LAURA: Oh, god.

03:30:52.410 --> 03:30:53.230
SAM: You out again?

03:30:53.230 --> 03:30:54.000
MARISHA: You're down again, aren't you?

03:30:54.000 --> 03:30:57.160
LAURA: No, it was halved to 20, so I'm 16.

03:30:57.160 --> 03:30:58.130
SAM: Hey!

03:30:58.130 --> 03:30:59.780
MATT: But a second Blight is used.

03:30:59.780 --> 03:31:00.940
MARISHA: Blight's nasty.

03:31:00.940 --> 03:31:02.180
TALIESIN: Blight's nasty.

03:31:02.180 --> 03:31:03.990
MATT: All right. Vax, now it's your turn.

03:31:03.990 --> 03:31:06.000
LIAM: He's within 60 feet of me?

03:31:06.000 --> 03:31:08.000
MATT: He would be, yes.

03:31:08.000 --> 03:31:13.740
LIAM: All right. And is there anyone around me? I
just can't see too well from here.

03:31:13.740 --> 03:31:16.090
MATT: There's people around you, but there's
nobody next to him.

03:31:16.090 --> 03:31:26.220
LIAM: Next to him, no, I know. Fuck it. I'm gonna
burn a bonus action and shoot out the wings and

03:31:26.220 --> 03:31:29.140
I'm gonna fly into his face and stab into each
side of his neck.

03:31:29.140 --> 03:31:30.220
TALIESIN: Fuck yeah!

03:31:30.220 --> 03:31:36.080
MATT: All righty. All of a sudden, the giant raven
wings streak out from each side of you and the air

03:31:36.080 --> 03:31:40.000
in the entirety of the room begins to swirl around
you, your hair gets tossed, as the giant wings

03:31:40.000 --> 03:31:46.630
begin to push him into the air. The raven-like
dagger-wielding champion of the Raven Queen leaps

03:31:46.630 --> 03:31:51.200
up and finds himself face-to-face with Sondur,
blades out. Go ahead and make your attacks.

03:31:51.200 --> 03:31:56.620
MARISHA: The breeze from his wings kinda stokes my
fire elemental form a little bit

03:31:56.620 --> 03:31:57.880
and I'm kind of into it.

03:31:57.880 --> 03:32:01.850
MATT: There you go. Yeah you are! Vax, go for it.

03:32:01.850 --> 03:32:02.900
LIAM: 28 on the first.

03:32:02.900 --> 03:32:04.450
MATT: Hits.

03:32:04.450 --> 03:32:05.850
LIAM: 29 on the second.

03:32:05.850 --> 03:32:06.830
MATT: Hits.

03:32:06.830 --> 03:32:08.640
LIAM: As I stab into both sides of his neck,
I say,

03:32:08.640 --> 03:32:10.720
If you want to get to my sister you gotta
get through me.

03:32:10.720 --> 03:32:15.410
Stab-stab. First one is ten,
second one is eight.

03:32:15.410 --> 03:32:20.930
MATT: All righty. As you jam both blades into the
side, the flames kind of curling up from the hit

03:32:20.930 --> 03:32:26.120
of one, the poison dagger jammed into the other,
the head descends and the mouth opens and from

03:32:26.120 --> 03:32:30.660
the inside you can see the semblance of the
human-like face you saw before come peek through,

03:32:30.660 --> 03:32:36.550
leaning out, almost like the queen alien's
secondary mouth. It kind of leans into your face,

03:32:36.550 --> 03:32:40.170
and the grin curls up in this evil smile.

03:32:40.170 --> 03:32:47.630
"I'll take both of you at this rate. There's only
so many betrayals one can survive."

03:32:47.630 --> 03:32:52.000
It clinks back into the head, the jaw closes.
That finishes your turn, Vax.

03:32:52.000 --> 03:32:53.120
LIAM: Yep.

03:32:53.120 --> 03:32:54.990
MATT: Percy, you're up. At the end of Vax's
turn...

03:32:54.990 --> 03:32:56.820
no, he can't, he already used his spell,
you're right.

03:32:56.820 --> 03:33:00.160
TALIESIN: All right. Okay.

03:33:00.160 --> 03:33:02.660
MARISHA: This guy had a rough breakup or
something, man.

03:33:02.660 --> 03:33:10.790
TALIESIN: No breakup is that rough. I'm going to,
I'm switching back to Bad News, and I'm going to

03:33:10.790 --> 03:33:14.750
reload and I'm going to try and, got that last
grit,

03:33:14.750 --> 03:33:17.170
I'm gonna just try and get him to drop the bow.

03:33:17.170 --> 03:33:18.870
MATT: Okay.

03:33:18.870 --> 03:33:20.270
MARISHA: Come on, Percy.

03:33:20.270 --> 03:33:22.310
TALIESIN: Part one. That'll do. 24.

03:33:22.310 --> 03:33:23.950
MATT: 24 hits.

03:33:23.950 --> 03:33:26.550
TALIESIN: He has to make a strength saving throw.

03:33:26.550 --> 03:33:29.440
MATT: Okay, that is a two, he's gonna use a
legendary resistance,

03:33:29.440 --> 03:33:31.770
the second one, to make the save.

03:33:31.770 --> 03:33:33.640
TALIESIN: Made the save using a legendary
resistance.

03:33:33.640 --> 03:33:34.430
MATT: Yes.

03:33:34.430 --> 03:33:36.490
TALIESIN: Okay, that's fine, don't care.

03:33:36.490 --> 03:33:41.800
MARISHA: (laughing) Don't care.

03:33:41.800 --> 03:33:46.150
TALIESIN: That'll do. That's 20 points of damage.

03:33:46.150 --> 03:33:49.560
MATT: All right.

03:33:49.560 --> 03:33:51.670
SAM: He has to make a strength check?

03:33:51.670 --> 03:33:54.190
TALIESIN: He has to make a, it's strength saving
throw.

03:33:54.190 --> 03:33:55.250
SAM: Saving.

03:33:55.250 --> 03:33:57.290
TALIESIN: Yeah, he makes it.

03:33:57.290 --> 03:34:02.780
SAM: Because I had a Cutting Words a while back.

03:34:02.780 --> 03:34:06.860
MATT: Right, but it means he has disadvantage,
but even if he fails, which he would've in that

03:34:06.860 --> 03:34:10.440
case, he still gets to make it automatically as
part of the legendary resistance.

03:34:10.440 --> 03:34:13.340
SAM: So that's negated my Cutting Words as well.

03:34:13.340 --> 03:34:16.550
MATT: For a legendary resistance, it does.
Which is why if you can burn through those early,

03:34:16.550 --> 03:34:19.600
then they're a little more vulnerable.

03:34:19.600 --> 03:34:24.170
TALIESIN: And just because nothing else seems to
be happening, I'm just gonna burn my Action Surge

03:34:24.170 --> 03:34:27.340
and just keep plowing into him for two more
shots.

03:34:27.340 --> 03:34:28.870
MATT: All right. How much damage did the first one
do?

03:34:28.870 --> 03:34:34.240
TALIESIN: That did 20 points of damage.

03:34:34.240 --> 03:34:37.980
MATT: Nice! (gunshot sound)

03:34:37.980 --> 03:34:43.090
TALIESIN: Taking another shot, that's 29.

03:34:43.090 --> 03:34:44.450
MATT: Hits.

03:34:44.450 --> 03:34:50.260
TALIESIN: That's 28 points of damage.

03:34:50.260 --> 03:34:52.200
MATT: Three hits. Go ahead and roll the other two
damage, now.

03:34:52.200 --> 03:34:53.020
TALIESIN: Hm?

03:34:53.020 --> 03:34:54.490
MATT: So you hit with all three, so.

03:34:54.490 --> 03:34:55.880
TALIESIN: No, I've been doing damage.

03:34:55.880 --> 03:34:57.220
MATT: Oh, those were the damage.

03:34:57.220 --> 03:34:58.090
TALIESIN: Yeah.

03:34:58.090 --> 03:34:59.130
MATT: Oh, I'm sorry.

03:34:59.130 --> 03:35:02.070
TALIESIN: Sorry. That's 20 points of damage and 28
points of damage. 22... wait.

03:35:02.070 --> 03:35:03.930
20 points of damage on the first attack.

03:35:03.930 --> 03:35:04.780
MATT: Yeah.

03:35:04.780 --> 03:35:10.940
TALIESIN: Attack I just did was 28 points of
damage.

03:35:10.940 --> 03:35:12.650
MATT: 28, sorry, all right, and then the third
one.

03:35:12.650 --> 03:35:14.080
TALIESIN: And then the third one.

03:35:14.080 --> 03:35:17.000
MATT: Roll to hit.

03:35:17.000 --> 03:35:20.700
TALIESIN: That hits, that's a 31.

03:35:20.700 --> 03:35:21.630
MATT: All righty.

03:35:21.630 --> 03:35:23.010
MARISHA: Do you crit on a 19?

03:35:23.010 --> 03:35:24.400
TALIESIN: I do not crit on a 19.

03:35:24.400 --> 03:35:26.460
MARISHA: Fuck. That's a good roll, though,
that's a good roll.

03:35:26.460 --> 03:35:28.190
TALIESIN: 18 points of damage.

03:35:28.190 --> 03:35:34.950
MATT: Nice. So (three gunshots) you can see now
he's starting to sag as he hangs outside of the

03:35:34.950 --> 03:35:40.860
wall with the daggers still held in him by Vax,
both impacts, each blast hitting the side of his

03:35:40.860 --> 03:35:46.650
torso, you can see now the wooden-armored exterior
is shattered and there's just this writhing mass

03:35:46.650 --> 03:35:51.170
of dark veiny vines holding his torso together.
He's looking pretty rough.

03:35:51.170 --> 03:35:55.590
TALIESIN: Lay into him! And I'm gonna run and
try and get some cover on the ent.

03:35:55.590 --> 03:35:59.070
In the dead-ent. Dead-ent dead-ent.

03:35:59.070 --> 03:36:00.420
SAM: (to the tune of the Pink Panther theme)
Dead-ent dead-ent--

03:36:00.420 --> 03:36:02.060
SAM, TALIESIN, and MARISHA: Dead-ent dead-ent
dead-ent dead-ent--

03:36:02.060 --> 03:36:03.320
MATT: Grog, you're up.

03:36:03.320 --> 03:36:04.700
LIAM: (slightly delayed) Dead-ent.

03:36:04.700 --> 03:36:06.500
TRAVIS: All right, can I stand up?

03:36:06.500 --> 03:36:07.410
MATT: Yes.

03:36:07.410 --> 03:36:13.400
TRAVIS: And I casually walk over so that I'm
standing between Vex and Sondur, right in front of

03:36:13.400 --> 03:36:15.420
Vex, like a human shield.

03:36:15.420 --> 03:36:16.550
MATT: Right there? Yes.

03:36:16.550 --> 03:36:22.580
TRAVIS: And I look up and I'm like, "Jesus,
this is fucking stupid. I've broken some hearts

03:36:22.580 --> 03:36:30.120
in my time, but you, stupid Romeo, are taking it
way too far. Guess what? NOBODY CARES." And I take

03:36:30.120 --> 03:36:32.500
the javelin of lightning and I throw it at him.

03:36:32.500 --> 03:36:34.780
(All cheer.)

03:36:34.780 --> 03:36:38.470
MATT: Slick. So let's go ahead and roll for that.

03:36:38.470 --> 03:36:40.520
SAM: Javelin of lightning.

03:36:40.520 --> 03:36:41.720
TALIESIN: Very very fair.

03:36:41.720 --> 03:36:44.260
MATT: Let me see what you have to do for that.
Do you have the item rules there?

03:36:44.260 --> 03:36:45.370
TRAVIS: I do have it here.

03:36:45.370 --> 03:36:46.510
MATT: What does it say?

03:36:46.510 --> 03:36:52.560
TRAVIS: If it hits, they have to make a DC 17
dexterity saving throw. If it hits, it's a 4d6

03:36:52.560 --> 03:36:54.950
lightning. Half if they make it.

03:36:54.950 --> 03:36:57.000
MATT: Right. So go ahead and roll to hit,
what was the hit?

03:36:57.000 --> 03:36:58.640
TALIESIN: And he burned a legendary save.

03:36:58.720 --> 03:37:01.210
TRAVIS: It was 24.

03:37:01.210 --> 03:37:02.880
SAM: He burned two of them.

03:37:02.880 --> 03:37:03.660
TALIESIN: Yeah.

03:37:03.660 --> 03:37:07.150
MATT: It hits, go ahead and roll damage.

03:37:07.150 --> 03:37:08.210
TRAVIS: 4d6.

03:37:08.210 --> 03:37:11.170
SAM: He didn't use any sort of legendary thing,
Matt?

03:37:11.170 --> 03:37:15.280
MATT: Well, when you hurl it, you don't roll to
hit with it. Five feet wide, it extends out from

03:37:15.280 --> 03:37:17.380
you to the target within 120 feet.

03:37:17.380 --> 03:37:24.140
Each creature in the line, excluding you and
the target, must make a DC... no, you're right,

03:37:24.140 --> 03:37:28.950
I read too far ahead. Yeah, you're good,
so 4d6 lightning damage.

03:37:28.950 --> 03:37:33.230
TRAVIS: Nice. Six, eight, seven... 12.

03:37:33.230 --> 03:37:35.060
MATT: 12 points of lightning damage?

03:37:35.060 --> 03:37:37.020
TRAVIS: 12 points of lightning damage.

03:37:37.020 --> 03:37:38.020
MATT: How do you want to do this?

03:37:38.020 --> 03:37:39.780
(All scream and cheer.)

03:37:39.780 --> 03:37:40.770
LAURA: Fuck, yeah!

03:37:40.770 --> 03:37:41.890
MARISHA: Yeah, Grog!

03:37:41.890 --> 03:37:43.060
SAM: You got the kill?

03:37:43.060 --> 03:37:43.760
MARISHA: Yes!

03:37:43.760 --> 03:37:45.350
SAM: You didn't do anything!

03:37:45.350 --> 03:37:48.190
TALIESIN: Walking around like an idiot the entire
game.

03:37:48.190 --> 03:37:50.480
TRAVIS: Chasing him around the room.

03:37:50.480 --> 03:37:52.750
SAM: You fell five times!

03:37:52.750 --> 03:37:55.120
MARISHA: You basically killed him with bro-shame.

03:37:55.120 --> 03:37:56.660
LIAM: And that cheeky line about romance.

03:37:56.660 --> 03:38:05.050
TRAVIS: I know, fuck! I throw it and hopefully get
it to go right in his mouth as he's trying to have

03:38:05.050 --> 03:38:11.010
a comeback. And I'll just look bewildered that it
worked.

03:38:11.010 --> 03:38:12.460
MATT: As you just shove it upward--

03:38:12.460 --> 03:38:15.550
LIAM: Can he use his bonus action to just shove
his sunglasses up at the end?

03:38:15.550 --> 03:38:20.620
MATT: As you chuck the javelin, you see it burst
forth with lightning-based propulsion magic.

03:38:20.620 --> 03:38:27.080
It sinks into the center of the jaw, which the
eyes go wide, the jaw hangs open loosely,

03:38:27.080 --> 03:38:33.940
and you can see the secondary face of Sondur
inside, the javelin pierced through his jaw now,

03:38:33.940 --> 03:38:38.370
his eyes wide, and you see the hand reach up to
try and grab the back of the vines. As he does,

03:38:38.370 --> 03:38:47.660
the javelin bursts into a shockwave of electrical
energy, scattering his body into a hundred pieces

03:38:47.660 --> 03:38:55.190
across the wall, falling off. Vax, you are pushed
back from the force of it, tumbling, manage to

03:38:55.190 --> 03:38:59.790
catch yourself in the air with your wings,
still flying, as the rest of Sondur's body just

03:38:59.790 --> 03:39:05.880
comes clattering to the ground in chunks.

03:39:05.880 --> 03:39:09.550
LAURA: I jump up on Grog's back. What the fuck!

03:39:09.550 --> 03:39:11.330
TRAVIS: I honestly did not expect that to happen.

03:39:11.330 --> 03:39:13.000
TALIESIN: I'm gonna walk up and grab--

03:39:13.000 --> 03:39:14.190
LAURA: Oh my god.

03:39:14.190 --> 03:39:15.280
MATT: The javelin clatters to the ground.

03:39:15.280 --> 03:39:16.990
TALIESIN: Grab the bow, real quick.

03:39:16.990 --> 03:39:19.400
TRAVIS: I go get the javelin, because it's
obviously worth keeping.

03:39:19.440 --> 03:39:22.910
SAM: I instinctually throw Keyleth in the air.

03:39:22.910 --> 03:39:24.580
MARISHA: And I go for it, too.

03:39:24.580 --> 03:39:28.830
MATT: You manage to dig yourself out of your vines
and rush up to Keyleth.

03:39:28.830 --> 03:39:30.020
SAM: No, no, with the hand.

03:39:30.020 --> 03:39:33.400
MATT: With the hand, oh yeah. The hand darts over,
grabs the fire elemental, and just kinda

03:39:33.400 --> 03:39:36.980
(sound of throwing and catching).

03:39:36.980 --> 03:39:39.380
MARISHA: Heeheehee.

03:39:39.380 --> 03:39:44.680
TRAVIS: Can I run back to Vex and offer her a
healing potion, unless someone can do better?

03:39:44.680 --> 03:39:47.830
LAURA: Oh, I can cast Cure Wounds on myself.

03:39:47.830 --> 03:39:49.790
TRAVIS: Are you all right?

03:39:49.790 --> 03:39:57.080
LAURA: I'm fine. Thank you. I was really
regretting that, attacking him, I thought maybe I

03:39:57.080 --> 03:40:00.260
should've just said yes and dealt with it.

03:40:00.260 --> 03:40:01.850
TRAVIS: What, become a corpse bride?

03:40:01.850 --> 03:40:02.860
TALIESIN: He was terrible.

03:40:02.860 --> 03:40:04.300
LAURA: I don't know, I just felt terrible.

03:40:04.300 --> 03:40:05.620
TALIESIN: He was terrible.

03:40:05.620 --> 03:40:08.260
MARISHA: I drop my fire elemental form.

03:40:08.260 --> 03:40:09.440
TALIESIN: That was a terrible person.

03:40:09.440 --> 03:40:11.620
TRAVIS: It's all right.

03:40:11.620 --> 03:40:13.440
LAURA: Thanks, Grog.

03:40:13.440 --> 03:40:15.260
TRAVIS: You did... you did good.

03:40:15.260 --> 03:40:16.800
LAURA: Thanks, so did you.

03:40:16.800 --> 03:40:20.200
MATT: A loud impact sounds as Ukurat lands.

03:40:20.200 --> 03:40:21.660
SAM: Oh, thank god.

03:40:21.660 --> 03:40:27.050
LAURA: I'm gonna cast Cure Wounds on myself before
anything else happens. As high of a level as I

03:40:27.050 --> 03:40:27.900
can, which is level three.

03:40:27.900 --> 03:40:29.030
MATT: Go for it.

03:40:29.030 --> 03:40:31.020
SAM: Does my Song of Rest need to be during a
short rest?

03:40:31.020 --> 03:40:32.360
MATT: Yes.

03:40:32.360 --> 03:40:38.580
TALIESIN: We have a mansion that's within walking
distance. And if we have to, we will run.

03:40:38.580 --> 03:40:42.320
TRAVIS: I'm gonna hand her the potion anyway,
as she's standing there, so.

03:40:42.320 --> 03:40:50.490
MATT: Okay. As she finishes healing herself,
Ukurat walks up towards the center of the room

03:40:50.490 --> 03:40:58.720
where you're standing next to her, and just kind
of pushes the currently now-smoldering body of the

03:40:58.720 --> 03:41:03.600
treant to the side.

03:41:03.600 --> 03:41:12.730
"A little late on the call to
arms. I'm just sad I missed most of the fight."

03:41:12.730 --> 03:41:17.400
TRAVIS: Didn't want you to miss out on all the
action.

03:41:17.400 --> 03:41:24.600
MATT: Got a couple licks in. Well. I guess this
calls us even.

03:41:24.600 --> 03:41:28.890
LAURA: Yeah.

03:41:28.890 --> 03:41:30.010
SAM: Thanks for coming.

03:41:30.010 --> 03:41:32.420
LAURA: Thank you for joining us.

03:41:32.420 --> 03:41:35.070
MATT: Be safe.

03:41:35.070 --> 03:41:36.030
LAURA: You too.

03:41:36.030 --> 03:41:39.690
TRAVIS: Wait. What will you do now?

03:41:39.690 --> 03:41:51.490
MATT: "My business is my own. As is yours.
I'll find my people. We'll find a home for us.

03:41:51.490 --> 03:41:55.190
"Now. You've done your task.

03:41:55.190 --> 03:42:01.620
"Leave before you plummet into any further
unknown dangers, foolish people."

03:42:01.620 --> 03:42:05.340
He turns around and leaps
towards the opening that he carved and crawls out

03:42:05.340 --> 03:42:07.250
of it and just disappears.

03:42:07.250 --> 03:42:09.000
MARISHA: You know, from him I think that was a
compliment.

03:42:09.000 --> 03:42:09.840
TALIESIN: It kind of was.

03:42:09.840 --> 03:42:10.790
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:42:10.790 --> 03:42:12.750
TRAVIS: He's so awesome.

03:42:12.750 --> 03:42:15.010
TALIESIN: It is sort of sad that we didn't catch
any theater.

03:42:15.010 --> 03:42:16.660
LAURA: Well, there's still time.

03:42:16.660 --> 03:42:18.790
TRAVIS: Can I try and jump through the hole like
he did?

03:42:18.790 --> 03:42:21.760
MATT: You reach over and leap through the hole.
Catch it.

03:42:21.760 --> 03:42:23.670
Yeah, it's still open, it's like pulled
open and actually--

03:42:23.670 --> 03:42:26.270
TRAVIS: I don't make it all the way in, though,
do I? It's up there.

03:42:26.270 --> 03:42:29.810
MATT: Oh, no, the hole that he pulled in was the
entrance you walked in to the base.

03:42:29.810 --> 03:42:31.110
TRAVIS: Oh, good.

03:42:31.110 --> 03:42:32.090
MATT: So you get there.

03:42:32.090 --> 03:42:33.530
TRAVIS: Little colonoscopy?

03:42:33.530 --> 03:42:36.930
MATT: Little bit, yeah.

03:42:36.930 --> 03:42:42.780
MARISHA: I go up to Vex and I just grab her arm
and I say,

03:42:42.780 --> 03:42:54.430
Don't let any man-- or anyone for that
matter-- make you feel like you need them to be

03:42:54.430 --> 03:43:03.610
great. Because you don't. I'm not good with
words.

03:43:03.610 --> 03:43:07.260
LAURA: That was wonderful, Keyleth. Thank you.

03:43:07.260 --> 03:43:08.770
MARISHA: But he was an asshole.

03:43:08.770 --> 03:43:10.850
LAURA: No, yeah, he was really... right?

03:43:10.850 --> 03:43:13.040
MARISHA: And I don't want you ever dating an
asshole.

03:43:13.040 --> 03:43:16.270
LAURA: (laughs) Thank you.

03:43:16.270 --> 03:43:18.680
MARISHA: He wasn't good enough, he was mean.

03:43:18.680 --> 03:43:20.340
TALIESIN: I'm going to saunter over.

03:43:20.340 --> 03:43:21.250
LAURA: What?

03:43:21.250 --> 03:43:25.740
TALIESIN: (in an exaggeratedly evil voice) We're a
lot alike, you and I. Bleaaah. (normal voice) What

03:43:25.740 --> 03:43:27.010
an asshole, Jesus.

03:43:27.010 --> 03:43:31.850
MARISHA: (in an exaggeratedly evil voice) You drug
your friends to their doom.

03:43:31.850 --> 03:43:35.160
TRAVIS: Can I walk over to Vax while they're
making a show?

03:43:35.160 --> 03:43:37.220
MARISHA: We keep making a show.

03:43:37.220 --> 03:43:38.500
TRAVIS: Quietly, I say,

03:43:38.500 --> 03:43:43.760
What was he talking about
with the bloody dagger?

03:43:43.760 --> 03:43:47.050
LIAM: Sorry, Feywild interference, what was that?

03:43:47.050 --> 03:43:52.780
TRAVIS: What was he saying about the bloody dagger
when he was talking to Vex?

03:43:52.780 --> 03:43:58.940
LIAM: You know, it's interesting, I understand
exactly zero percent of what the DM was saying

03:43:58.940 --> 03:44:01.700
while he was in-character as that particular
character

03:44:01.700 --> 03:44:04.700
due to the nature of Skype and
microphones.

03:44:04.700 --> 03:44:05.620
TRAVIS: Yes.

03:44:05.620 --> 03:44:09.330
LIAM: So I was faking understanding the whole
time, and then picked it up in retrospect

03:44:09.330 --> 03:44:13.210
listening to Laura's responses. I missed it.

03:44:13.210 --> 03:44:14.820
TRAVIS: Yeah.

03:44:14.820 --> 03:44:16.180
LAURA: Who's this Laura you're speaking of?

03:44:16.180 --> 03:44:18.980
(All laugh.)

03:44:18.980 --> 03:44:23.240
LIAM: I don't know. I don't know anything.

03:44:23.240 --> 03:44:29.100
LAURA: That's okay. It's fine that you didn't
hear. He said nothing about a bloody dagger.

03:44:29.100 --> 03:44:31.070
Nothing at all.

03:44:31.070 --> 03:44:34.610
LIAM: We should find that dagger. No question.

03:44:34.610 --> 03:44:37.730
TALIESIN: Is there anything other than the bow
worth looting on this terrible person, since I'm

03:44:37.730 --> 03:44:39.080
rummaging through his...

03:44:39.080 --> 03:44:40.430
MATT: Make an investigation check.

03:44:40.430 --> 03:44:41.520
TALIESIN: Right.

03:44:41.520 --> 03:44:44.000
TRAVIS: Well, let's not downplay the bow.

03:44:44.000 --> 03:44:44.920
TALIESIN: I've got it already.

03:44:44.920 --> 03:44:47.740
SAM: Hey, guys, I'm still trapped in the vines!

03:44:47.740 --> 03:44:52.440
LAURA: Oh, Scanlan! I run over and I start
pulling the vines off of him. Holy shit, Scanlan,

03:44:52.440 --> 03:44:55.760
I'm so sorry. Thank you for healing me.

03:44:55.760 --> 03:44:57.180
SAM: Certainly.

03:44:57.180 --> 03:44:58.940
TRAVIS: Are you in fine form? Should I hit you
until you--

03:44:58.940 --> 03:45:02.900
SAM: No, don't hit me. I'll sing more Spice
Girls.

03:45:02.900 --> 03:45:04.280
LAURA: That was really lovely.

03:45:04.280 --> 03:45:05.390
SAM: Thank you.

03:45:05.390 --> 03:45:09.250
LAURA: Spice Girls is so empowering.

03:45:09.250 --> 03:45:15.760
MATT: So, you pull the vines from him, as you
inspect around, too, you notice there's not much

03:45:15.760 --> 03:45:25.600
really of worth here. This home is mostly natural
in its base. However, the slow trickle of the

03:45:25.600 --> 03:45:36.730
black oil-like substance has ceased. Most of it's
grown thicker and stopped, and it just feels like

03:45:36.730 --> 03:45:41.670
the whole place went into this sudden stasis,
like the slow crawl of everything nearby,

03:45:41.670 --> 03:45:45.480
the vines, everything stopped.

03:45:45.480 --> 03:45:47.500
LAURA: We didn't kill the whole forest, did we?

03:45:47.500 --> 03:45:48.540
SAM: Little bit.

03:45:48.540 --> 03:45:50.280
MARISHA: I drop to my knees and do a Commune with
Nature.

03:45:50.280 --> 03:45:53.180
MATT: Okay.

03:45:53.180 --> 03:45:58.210
MARISHA: Do I gather a different energy from the
surrounding plants?

03:45:58.210 --> 03:46:05.100
MATT: You still feel the ever-present bloom of
life and life-forces surrounding you entirely.

03:46:05.100 --> 03:46:15.870
You do feel a wave of relaxation. There is a sort
of general radial sigh that is slowly trickling

03:46:15.870 --> 03:46:17.610
from the center of the tree.

03:46:17.610 --> 03:46:19.410
MARISHA: Do I still sense the presence of Sondur?

03:46:19.410 --> 03:46:23.110
MATT: No.

03:46:23.110 --> 03:46:33.760
MARISHA: Do, last question. Does the tree seem
happier? What is the tree gonna do from here on

03:46:33.760 --> 03:46:36.820
out? What are you gonna do, tree?

03:46:36.820 --> 03:46:38.080
MATT: Exist.

03:46:38.080 --> 03:46:42.200
MARISHA: Exist, cool. Everything seems great.

03:46:42.200 --> 03:46:45.580
TRAVIS: Cool. Since I got the killing blow,
can I chop this tree down now?

03:46:45.580 --> 03:46:46.520
LAURA: This whole tree?

03:46:46.520 --> 03:46:47.420
MARISHA: This big one?

03:46:47.420 --> 03:46:49.000
SAM: No, it's just a tree now, I think it's okay.

03:46:49.000 --> 03:46:52.730
MARISHA: Yeah, you know, the tree just told me
that it actually feels much better, so.

03:46:52.730 --> 03:46:54.200
TRAVIS: I get to chop a tree at some point.

03:46:54.200 --> 03:46:56.160
LAURA: You see those trees over there?

03:46:56.160 --> 03:46:59.130
TRAVIS: They're already down.

03:46:59.130 --> 03:47:02.880
LAURA: No no no, I see it twitching, Grog,
it's definitely twitching.

03:47:02.880 --> 03:47:08.390
LIAM: We're going to Vasselheim soon, you can cut
down a lot of trees there. It's cold there,

03:47:08.390 --> 03:47:10.290
they could use the firewood. Soon.

03:47:10.290 --> 03:47:12.830
MARISHA: Trees that won't take it personal.

03:47:12.830 --> 03:47:15.910
TALIESIN: I know that's not nearly as much fun,
but it is available.

03:47:15.910 --> 03:47:16.870
TRAVIS: This is true.

03:47:16.870 --> 03:47:18.680
LIAM: What are we talking about? Vex'ahlia.

03:47:18.680 --> 03:47:19.590
LAURA: What?

03:47:19.590 --> 03:47:22.080
LIAM: I'm fucking curious. Pull that bowstring.

03:47:22.080 --> 03:47:22.880
LAURA: Well, I don't have it.

03:47:22.880 --> 03:47:24.950
TALIESIN: Toss it.

03:47:24.950 --> 03:47:27.690
SAM: Are you sure Vex'ahlia should get it?

03:47:27.690 --> 03:47:28.770
TALIESIN: I know, I was thinking that.

03:47:28.770 --> 03:47:30.250
LAURA: Do you need it, Scanlan, do you think--

03:47:30.250 --> 03:47:32.730
SAM: I think maybe I should get it, I fought
bravely in the last fight.

03:47:32.730 --> 03:47:34.980
LAURA: You did. Maybe Grog should get it, I mean,
he did get the killing blow.

03:47:34.980 --> 03:47:38.030
LIAM: Scanlan, I think you would make a very good
arrow for it.

03:47:38.030 --> 03:47:40.640
(All laugh.)

03:47:40.640 --> 03:47:42.550
TRAVIS: I could get down with that.

03:47:42.550 --> 03:47:46.420
MATT: You hold it in your hand and look at it.
The handle is wrapped with a very tight dark

03:47:46.420 --> 03:47:52.140
brown, black leather, and at the cusp of where the
handle itself is and where the arrow is notched is

03:47:52.140 --> 03:48:00.500
this nice golden-bronze cap-like metallic inlay.
The rest of the bow itself is this curved,

03:48:00.500 --> 03:48:10.120
almost deep verdant green jungle vine-type
texture to it, where it builds on itself like a

03:48:10.120 --> 03:48:16.480
series of natural leaf scales. And as it curves
into the ends of the actual recurve bow,

03:48:16.480 --> 03:48:23.440
as you hold it, it flexes and shifts on its own.
It actually looks, as you hold it it almost seems

03:48:23.440 --> 03:48:32.780
to tighten and then relax, and then as you reach
back an arrow, it goes taut, and the string goes

03:48:32.860 --> 03:48:39.290
extremely tight. As you pull the arrow back,
it's like no strength involved at all.

03:48:39.290 --> 03:48:40.220
LAURA: What?

03:48:40.220 --> 03:48:46.300
MATT: It pulls back on its own, and as soon as you
release, the arrow that you fire shoots off at an

03:48:46.300 --> 03:48:52.040
incredible speed and the actual bow itself flexes
with such intensity that it makes this roaring

03:48:52.040 --> 03:48:54.980
whoosh sound with each shot.

03:48:54.980 --> 03:48:57.070
TALIESIN: Well, that's exciting.

03:48:57.070 --> 03:48:58.990
LAURA: That's really badass.

03:48:58.990 --> 03:49:01.710
TRAVIS: You wanna shoot me with it?

03:49:01.710 --> 03:49:04.050
LAURA: I wanna shoot everything with it.

03:49:04.050 --> 03:49:08.320
LIAM: Do you still need muscle strength to pull
it, or is it just easy-peasy now?

03:49:08.320 --> 03:49:11.510
LAURA: It's kind of easy-peasy. I guess anybody
could pull this.

03:49:11.510 --> 03:49:13.320
LIAM: You're going to have to start doing pushups,
then.

03:49:13.320 --> 03:49:18.480
LAURA: (laughs) I guess I did say--

03:49:18.480 --> 03:49:21.080
MARISHA: Do you want to hit something? Here,
I'm--

03:49:21.080 --> 03:49:23.290
SAM: Do you want to shoot me? I'll be okay.

03:49:23.290 --> 03:49:24.620
LAURA: I'm not going to shoot you.

03:49:24.620 --> 03:49:26.240
SAM: I'll be okay, you shot me before.

03:49:26.240 --> 03:49:26.980
LAURA: No.

03:49:26.980 --> 03:49:27.980
SAM: Right here.

03:49:27.980 --> 03:49:28.890
TALIESIN: You don't know what it does.

03:49:28.890 --> 03:49:30.650
LAURA: Oh, look at that scar, it's beautiful.

03:49:30.650 --> 03:49:31.940
TRAVIS: Can we get out of this fucking tree
first?

03:49:31.940 --> 03:49:33.740
LAURA: You're right, we should probably get out of
here, maybe.

03:49:33.740 --> 03:49:36.400
SAM: Guys. Life needs things to live.

03:49:36.400 --> 03:49:39.800
(All laugh.)

03:49:39.800 --> 03:49:43.730
TALIESIN: I had not had my coffee, I was tired,
there was no bacon...

03:49:43.730 --> 03:49:48.260
SAM: And we are those things. I think we've all
learned a lot today.

03:49:48.260 --> 03:49:49.640
LAURA: We've learned so much.

03:49:49.640 --> 03:49:50.880
TALIESIN: I hate you so much.

03:49:50.880 --> 03:49:52.910
TRAVIS: I walk out of the tree.

03:49:52.910 --> 03:49:55.450
TALIESIN: I need fresh air. I'm done.

03:49:55.450 --> 03:50:00.220
LAURA: What does it look like outside of the tree?
Is the black muck still black mucky?

03:50:00.220 --> 03:50:04.610
MATT: I mean, the whole forest is still just
coated in this horrible thick liquid.

03:50:04.610 --> 03:50:06.650
TRAVIS: Did you loot Sondur's body?

03:50:06.650 --> 03:50:08.280
TALIESIN: I did, but it wasn't much.

03:50:08.280 --> 03:50:12.370
MATT: But when you approached and you inspected
the tree, there was just an ever-constant flow of

03:50:12.370 --> 03:50:18.470
it, of this thick molasses-type material,
just slowly drifting down the tree. You look down

03:50:18.470 --> 03:50:21.900
and a lot of it seems to have stopped and is
hardening, almost like an amber.

03:50:21.900 --> 03:50:24.480
LAURA: Okay.

03:50:24.480 --> 03:50:25.910
TRAVIS: Like Jurassic Park.

03:50:25.910 --> 03:50:26.850
TALIESIN: This is good.

03:50:26.850 --> 03:50:28.050
SAM: (cracks up)

03:50:28.050 --> 03:50:29.730
LAURA: Yeah, at least it's not burying the forest
anymore.

03:50:29.730 --> 03:50:31.040
TALIESIN: No, we did very well.

03:50:31.040 --> 03:50:31.820
SAM: Sweet.

03:50:31.820 --> 03:50:33.380
TALIESIN: Let's go home.

03:50:33.380 --> 03:50:34.900
MARISHA: You guys ready to go home?

03:50:34.900 --> 03:50:38.460
TALIESIN: I'm, well. Do we wanna, is there a
reason to stay or is it time to go home?

03:50:38.460 --> 03:50:39.630
LAURA: Let's get out of here.

03:50:39.630 --> 03:50:41.130
MARISHA: I think I've seen enough of the Feywild
for now.

03:50:41.130 --> 03:50:41.980
TALIESIN: I'm quite pleased.

03:50:41.980 --> 03:50:43.170
SAM: We could stop at that hut on the way out.

03:50:43.170 --> 03:50:44.150
MARISHA: No, no, no.

03:50:44.150 --> 03:50:45.110
LAURA: No no. Not.

03:50:45.110 --> 03:50:46.150
SAM: We never found the theater.

03:50:46.150 --> 03:50:48.330
LIAM: The theater, the theater! What about the
theater?

03:50:48.330 --> 03:50:49.320
SAM: You know what we could do--

03:50:49.320 --> 03:50:50.850
LAURA: Sorry, brother, I think we have other
things to attend to.

03:50:50.850 --> 03:50:55.480
SAM: You know what we could do, Vex'ahlia,
we could go about 200 feet away from the hut and

03:50:55.480 --> 03:50:59.280
you could just--fink!--and see what it does and
then we'll shift out of there.

03:50:59.280 --> 03:51:01.790
LAURA: And then we just shoot out of the Feywild.
How about no.

03:51:01.790 --> 03:51:02.940
SAM: All right.

03:51:02.940 --> 03:51:06.130
TRAVIS: Anybody want to climb to the top of the
200-foot tree to see what the rest of the land

03:51:06.130 --> 03:51:06.960
looks like?

03:51:06.960 --> 03:51:08.530
MATT: (clapping)

03:51:08.530 --> 03:51:09.380
LIAM: I fly up there--

03:51:09.380 --> 03:51:10.700
SAM: Oh! Wait, someone's here.

03:51:10.700 --> 03:51:13.430
MATT: You hear slow clapping from nearby.

03:51:13.430 --> 03:51:14.450
MARISHA: That can't be good.

03:51:14.450 --> 03:51:15.350
LAURA: Oh, no.

03:51:15.350 --> 03:51:22.730
MATT: As you look off to the side of the tree,
rounding the bend, you see a very tall and thin,

03:51:22.730 --> 03:51:32.550
chest-forward, regal-posed, almost elflike but
still exaggerated in the Feylike features.

03:51:32.550 --> 03:51:39.060
Long ears that curl past the head. The head
itself is small with a pointed chin, the eyes

03:51:39.060 --> 03:51:46.410
almond-shaped and wild, curly orange hair like a
lion's mane that goes down to the lower back,

03:51:46.410 --> 03:51:53.850
just up and large, curves up at the very tip.
You see sleeveless silk vestments of blue and

03:51:53.850 --> 03:51:57.970
green billowing freely behind him as he walks up
clapping.

03:51:57.970 --> 03:52:00.580
LAURA: I instantly case Cure Wounds on myself
again.

03:52:00.580 --> 03:52:01.310
MATT: All right.

03:52:01.310 --> 03:52:04.880
LAURA: At a level three.

03:52:04.880 --> 03:52:07.600
MATT: How much do you heal?

03:52:07.600 --> 03:52:09.980
LAURA: 13 plus eight is 25.

03:52:09.980 --> 03:52:12.190
MATT: There you go. 25.

03:52:12.190 --> 03:52:13.440
LIAM: Garmelie?

03:52:13.440 --> 03:52:15.220
LAURA: No, that's wrong. 21.

03:52:15.220 --> 03:52:16.670
MATT: Bravo, everyone.

03:52:16.670 --> 03:52:18.250
SAM: Who is this?

03:52:18.340 --> 03:52:22.080
MATT: Bravo to each and every one of you.
It's been fun to watch. You know, I get so

03:52:22.080 --> 03:52:34.940
disinterested in these lands, and I have to say,
I'm impressed. Well. I wish to say adieu.

03:52:34.940 --> 03:52:36.440
Good luck on your journeys.

03:52:36.440 --> 03:52:37.950
LAURA: Who are you?

03:52:37.950 --> 03:52:44.690
MATT: But I am a simple wanderer. An individual
who sees the landscape for artistic benefit.

03:52:44.690 --> 03:52:48.580
TALIESIN: I knew it.

03:52:48.580 --> 03:52:52.440
MATT: But I'm glad to have made your acquaintance.
It definitely made these past few days absolutely

03:52:52.440 --> 03:52:58.330
devoid of boredom, at the very least, and filled
my sketchbook.

03:52:58.330 --> 03:52:59.490
MARISHA: Garmelie?

03:52:59.490 --> 03:53:02.650
MATT: Is one of my names. I prefer Artagan.

03:53:02.650 --> 03:53:04.590
SAM: Artagan?

03:53:04.590 --> 03:53:10.700
MATT: But Garmelie suits needs here and there.
I go by many names and many interesting--

03:53:10.700 --> 03:53:13.110
TALIESIN: I knew I should've asked for that
portrait.

03:53:13.110 --> 03:53:15.830
SAM: What are you?

03:53:15.830 --> 03:53:21.280
MATT: I'm afraid the time for questions is done.
As your journey has come to an end, and I have to

03:53:21.280 --> 03:53:22.880
be out of here quickly as--

03:53:22.880 --> 03:53:25.540
SAM: I cast Otiluke's Resilient Sphere on him.

03:53:25.540 --> 03:53:27.470
MARISHA: And I cast Hold Person at the same time.

03:53:27.470 --> 03:53:29.270
MATT: (laughs)

03:53:29.270 --> 03:53:35.120
TALIESIN: What? What! What! What!

03:53:35.120 --> 03:53:36.270
TRAVIS: Nice, Sam.

03:53:36.270 --> 03:53:37.670
TALIESIN: No! Oh!

03:53:37.670 --> 03:53:39.210
LAURA: What is he? Who is he? What is he?

03:53:39.210 --> 03:53:39.820
MATT: All right.

03:53:39.820 --> 03:53:40.780
SAM: I don't know.

03:53:40.780 --> 03:53:42.000
MATT: What's the DC?

03:53:42.000 --> 03:53:42.980
LIAM: He's a deity.

03:53:42.980 --> 03:53:43.970
TRAVIS: Hold it, Marisha.

03:53:43.970 --> 03:53:44.900
SAM: 19.

03:53:44.900 --> 03:53:46.440
MARISHA: 19 for mine as well.

03:53:46.440 --> 03:53:47.690
SAM: 'Cause I didn't pull up the Cone.

03:53:47.690 --> 03:53:49.090
LAURA: Is he like a god?

03:53:49.090 --> 03:53:56.210
MATT: Right. So. The sphere appears around his
form, however, Keyleth, your spell does not seem

03:53:56.210 --> 03:53:59.870
to take any sort of hold on him. As it forms
around,

03:53:59.870 --> 03:54:03.950
he's still just standing there unmoved,
hands clasped.

03:54:03.950 --> 03:54:10.870
"That's adorable. So. Where to
now? Where's your journey taking you? I take it

03:54:10.870 --> 03:54:16.530
"this was not your only purpose. Where's your next
destination?"

03:54:16.530 --> 03:54:20.820
TRAVIS: We left an empty grave inside, it's got
your name on it if you don't talk.

03:54:20.820 --> 03:54:21.980
LAURA: Pfff.

03:54:21.980 --> 03:54:27.620
MATT: Please.

03:54:27.620 --> 03:54:32.090
LAURA: We go home. And we kill a dragon.

03:54:32.090 --> 03:54:37.560
MATT: Good. They are fickle creatures. They need
to be taught a lesson.

03:54:37.560 --> 03:54:39.490
LAURA: Any tips?

03:54:39.490 --> 03:54:56.530
MATT: (laughs) Don't be eaten. Um. Do not
misunderstand their intelligence. Some are more

03:54:56.530 --> 03:55:05.290
bestial. Some are more together. Anyway.
If you'd be so kind,

03:55:05.290 --> 03:55:07.190
I'd like to get on with my day.

03:55:07.190 --> 03:55:11.940
LAURA: Wait, one last thing. What is this statue
that you tried to steal from me?

03:55:11.940 --> 03:55:13.030
TRAVIS: (whispers) Nice.

03:55:13.030 --> 03:55:18.270
MATT: Oh, that's a companion. You're welcome to
keep him with you. I just figured since I was

03:55:18.270 --> 03:55:21.350
leaving you soon, I'd have someone to wander at my
side as well.

03:55:21.350 --> 03:55:22.780
SAM: A companion? What does that mean?

03:55:22.780 --> 03:55:23.820
MATT: Yes.

03:55:23.820 --> 03:55:24.980
TRAVIS: A statue.

03:55:24.980 --> 03:55:27.770
SAM: Does he come to life?

03:55:27.770 --> 03:55:29.430
MATT: With the right words, yes.

03:55:29.430 --> 03:55:31.830
LAURA, SAM, TALIESIN, and MARISHA: What are those
words?

03:55:31.830 --> 03:55:38.210
MATT: (laughs) Well. Take some time with it.
You'll learn them soon enough.

03:55:38.210 --> 03:55:43.000
MARISHA: You know, for someone who hates the
theater, you've made quite a show of all this.

03:55:43.000 --> 03:55:45.740
(All laugh.)

03:55:45.740 --> 03:55:47.690
TRAVIS: Oh man. That was a ten.

03:55:47.690 --> 03:55:49.300
LAURA: That was good, that was good, Keyleth.

03:55:49.300 --> 03:55:52.830
LIAM: Yep, yep, yep.

03:55:52.830 --> 03:56:00.880
MATT: Touche, Keyleth, touche. But no, seriously,
I fucking hate the theater.

03:56:00.880 --> 03:56:06.680
You avoided the other one, right?

03:56:06.680 --> 03:56:08.180
LAURA: The hag?

03:56:08.180 --> 03:56:09.450
MATT: Hag?

03:56:09.450 --> 03:56:11.050
SAM: The hut, the hut.

03:56:11.050 --> 03:56:12.030
MARISHA: Wodenna.

03:56:12.030 --> 03:56:12.840
LAURA: The hut.

03:56:12.840 --> 03:56:14.100
MATT: The hut, yes, you avoided the hut?

03:56:14.100 --> 03:56:15.870
SAM: She's not a hag?

03:56:15.870 --> 03:56:20.880
MATT: She's many things, but she's not a hag.
She's an ex.

03:56:20.880 --> 03:56:23.540
LAURA: Oh.

03:56:23.540 --> 03:56:25.460
MATT: Anyway. If you don't mind.

03:56:25.460 --> 03:56:26.680
SAM: One question.

03:56:26.680 --> 03:56:30.350
MATT: (exasperated noise) Now you grow boring and
dreary. I hate boredom.

03:56:30.350 --> 03:56:33.150
SAM: Do you stay on this plane or do you come with
us?

03:56:33.150 --> 03:56:34.390
MATT: No, I stay on this plane.

03:56:34.500 --> 03:56:36.290
SAM: All right.

03:56:36.290 --> 03:56:39.440
MATT: Unless I decide to come with you. But that's
of my own volition.

03:56:39.440 --> 03:56:41.890
Probably when you least expect it.

03:56:41.890 --> 03:56:42.940
SAM: All right.

03:56:42.940 --> 03:56:45.070
TALIESIN: Good day to you, Puck. Good day.

03:56:45.070 --> 03:56:46.610
SAM: What was your name again?

03:56:46.610 --> 03:56:48.020
MATT: Ah, well. Artagan.

03:56:48.020 --> 03:56:50.910
SAM and LAURA: Artagan.

03:56:50.910 --> 03:56:52.360
LAURA: Thanks for the fun.

03:56:52.360 --> 03:56:55.050
TALIESIN: Thanks for the art.

03:56:55.050 --> 03:56:58.220
MATT: Thanks for the memories. Ah, memories.

03:56:58.220 --> 03:57:03.940
SAM: You know, at some point you should ask
yourself why we didn't just kill you and why we

03:57:03.940 --> 03:57:07.260
knew that you were there the whole time.

03:57:07.260 --> 03:57:11.300
MATT: What, you think I didn't let you find me?
Think you could've killed me if you wanted?

03:57:11.300 --> 03:57:15.030
TRAVIS: Artagan. Did you know Sondur?

03:57:15.030 --> 03:57:18.020
MATT: I knew of Sondur, yes.

03:57:18.020 --> 03:57:20.040
MARISHA: Did you know Sorudin?

03:57:20.040 --> 03:57:20.750
SAM: Who?

03:57:20.750 --> 03:57:23.150
MARISHA: Sorudin the Happy?

03:57:23.150 --> 03:57:31.630
MATT: Sorudin I did not know, but I was aware of
the enchantment left behind. But who am I to lead

03:57:31.630 --> 03:57:34.930
a horse to water when you are so determined to
drink yourself?

03:57:34.930 --> 03:57:37.370
LAURA: (laughs) It was great fun.

03:57:37.370 --> 03:57:41.460
MATT: That it was. It was great fun. But alas.

03:57:41.460 --> 03:57:42.690
SAM: All right.

03:57:42.690 --> 03:57:45.350
MARISHA: I have a feeling we'll meet you again,
Artagan.

03:57:45.350 --> 03:57:51.700
MATT: I hope so. It does get ever so boring.

03:57:51.700 --> 03:57:55.160
SAM: All right, I'll release the sphere on one
condition.

03:57:55.160 --> 03:57:57.750
MATT: Yes?

03:57:57.750 --> 03:58:05.530
SAM: I believe you have a quill that belongs to
us. Just a single writing implement.

03:58:05.530 --> 03:58:10.180
We lent it to you, we want it back.

03:58:10.180 --> 03:58:13.540
MATT: It appears in his hand.

03:58:13.540 --> 03:58:17.410
"I'm happy to give it to you, but I'm
apparently trapped in this sphere of magic."

03:58:17.410 --> 03:58:18.830
SAM: All right, I'll let you go.

03:58:18.830 --> 03:58:20.070
MATT: Thank you.

03:58:20.070 --> 03:58:25.580
SAM: Thank you. Vax. Was this yours?

03:58:25.580 --> 03:58:28.470
LAURA: There's your raven feather. Nice.

03:58:28.470 --> 03:58:39.390
MATT: "All right. Travel safe. Stay alive.
And maybe visit. If you get lonely."

03:58:39.390 --> 03:58:43.530
And he gives a deep bow and just vanishes.

03:58:43.530 --> 03:58:45.470
LAURA: He was fucking cool.

03:58:45.470 --> 03:58:47.240
TALIESIN: Dear god, let's get out of here before
something else happens.

03:58:47.240 --> 03:58:50.380
LAURA: I really liked him.

03:58:50.380 --> 03:58:52.720
MARISHA: Everyone hold hands and say Kumbaya.

03:58:52.720 --> 03:58:55.780
SAM: Okay. Let's go back to our plane.

03:58:55.780 --> 03:58:57.470
TRAVIS: You don't want to see the ex?

03:58:57.470 --> 03:58:58.950
ALL: No.

03:58:58.950 --> 03:59:01.600
MARISHA: We've dealt with enough scorned lovers
for one day.

03:59:01.600 --> 03:59:03.620
TALIESIN: People get bitchy over here.

03:59:03.620 --> 03:59:05.310
LAURA: Where are we popping into?

03:59:05.310 --> 03:59:06.450
MARISHA: I guess Whitestone?

03:59:06.450 --> 03:59:07.230
TALIESIN: Whitestone.

03:59:07.230 --> 03:59:07.980
LAURA: Yeah.

03:59:07.980 --> 03:59:09.100
LIAM: What are we doing, we're warping out?

03:59:09.100 --> 03:59:10.300
TALIESIN: Yeah, we're warping out.

03:59:10.300 --> 03:59:11.270
SAM: Say bye to the Fey.

03:59:11.270 --> 03:59:13.470
LAURA: Hold your hands up, brother, we're holding
your hands.

03:59:13.470 --> 03:59:17.940
LIAM: Yeah, but I'm tangling my fingers up,
if she'll let me, with Keyleth.

03:59:17.940 --> 03:59:18.680
LAURA: Oh.

03:59:18.680 --> 03:59:19.620
SAM: Gross.

03:59:19.620 --> 03:59:20.280
TRAVIS: I let go.

03:59:20.280 --> 03:59:21.620
TALIESIN: Ew.

03:59:21.620 --> 03:59:22.710
MATT: All right.

03:59:22.710 --> 03:59:23.880
MARISHA: I take his hand.

03:59:23.880 --> 03:59:27.720
LIAM: And say, just quietly to the side,

03:59:27.720 --> 03:59:32.780
You know, you've been pretty fucking amazing
lately. As usual.

03:59:32.780 --> 03:59:38.260
MARISHA: I say, You haven't been quite bad,
yourself. And then we go to Whitestone.

03:59:38.260 --> 03:59:44.240
MATT: To Whitestone. The transition takes place,
you all feel the breath fill your lungs as all of

03:59:44.240 --> 03:59:49.130
a sudden your momentum is shot through but a step
forward, and you catch yourself standing outside

03:59:49.130 --> 03:59:53.640
of the Sun Tree in the center of Whitestone's main
area.

03:59:53.640 --> 03:59:55.200
And that's where we'll end tonight's
session.

03:59:55.200 --> 03:59:58.810
TRAVIS: What! Got your bow!

03:59:58.810 --> 03:59:59.910
LAURA: Hey!

03:59:59.910 --> 04:00:00.950
MARISHA: You got your bow!

04:00:00.950 --> 04:00:01.870
TRAVIS: You didn't die!

04:00:01.870 --> 04:00:02.850
TALIESIN: You got your bow.

04:00:02.850 --> 04:00:03.860
SAM: Ooh, there it is.

04:00:03.860 --> 04:00:05.440
LAURA: Ahh, there's the card, there's the card.

04:00:05.440 --> 04:00:08.530
MARISHA: Man, that guy tried to act like he knew
you. Fuck that shit.

04:00:08.530 --> 04:00:09.810
MATT: Ryan, do you have the--

04:00:09.810 --> 04:00:11.630
LAURA: He had so many things wrong.

04:00:11.630 --> 04:00:12.700
MARISHA: Oh, dude.

04:00:12.700 --> 04:00:14.980
MATT: The item list that you found--

04:00:14.980 --> 04:00:17.780
SAM: What does it do, what does it do?

04:00:17.780 --> 04:00:24.810
LAURA: Okay, okay. +3 bonus to attack and damage
rolls. 1d4 lightning damage.

04:00:24.810 --> 04:00:26.310
TALIESIN: Yeah.

04:00:26.310 --> 04:00:32.980
LAURA: I can declare a bramble-shot like you did.
Whoa. Target takes an additional 4d8 piercing

04:00:32.980 --> 04:00:37.620
damage, plus they have to make a strength saving
throw or be restrained.

04:00:37.620 --> 04:00:41.600
MATT: Restrained means it can't move, all their
attacks have disadvantage, and attacks against

04:00:41.600 --> 04:00:46.240
them have advantage, until they break free.
And this is the figurine.

04:00:46.240 --> 04:00:54.750
LAURA: Whoa, this is so cool! Once per short rest,
I can use an Oracle Shot.

04:00:54.750 --> 04:00:55.670
SAM: What does that do?

04:00:55.670 --> 04:01:00.450
LAURA: I can project my sight through my arrow
that I fire from it, for up to ten minutes.

04:01:00.450 --> 04:01:02.470
SAM: Oh, Prince of Thieves-style?

04:01:02.470 --> 04:01:03.330
LAURA: My god.

04:01:03.330 --> 04:01:04.800
TALIESIN: Is that really a thing?

04:01:04.800 --> 04:01:05.730
SAM: I don't know.

04:01:05.730 --> 04:01:06.650
TALIESIN: Okay.

04:01:06.650 --> 04:01:07.530
LAURA: That's awesome.

04:01:07.530 --> 04:01:09.310
MARISHA: That's cool, she's like Hanzo.

04:01:09.310 --> 04:01:10.300
MATT: It's pretty cool.

04:01:10.300 --> 04:01:16.370
LAURA: Imagine from the broom up high how far that
arrow would go. And then when a creature is killed

04:01:16.370 --> 04:01:21.070
by an arrow from this weapon, a single six-foot
tree grows out of their corpse.

04:01:21.070 --> 04:01:22.550
TALIESIN: Yeah!

04:01:22.550 --> 04:01:24.350
MARISHA: Out of their corpse?

04:01:24.350 --> 04:01:25.850
SAM: A Christmas tree?

04:01:25.850 --> 04:01:27.210
LAURA: A Christmas tree.

04:01:27.210 --> 04:01:28.850
MATT: Depending on the time of year, it may be.

04:01:28.850 --> 04:01:31.530
TRAVIS: You don't need the Onyx Dog, why don't I
hold onto that.

04:01:31.530 --> 04:01:32.530
SAM: Wait, you got the dog?

04:01:32.530 --> 04:01:34.760
LAURA: Wait, no, I wanna see what it is.

04:01:34.760 --> 04:01:36.210
MARISHA: Yeah, can we talk about that dog? Can we
talk about it?

04:01:36.210 --> 04:01:37.140
TRAVIS: You don't need it.

04:01:37.140 --> 04:01:38.370
LAURA: I have it.

04:01:38.370 --> 04:01:39.340
MATT: (laughs)

04:01:39.340 --> 04:01:40.400
LAURA: Travis.

04:01:40.400 --> 04:01:41.670
TALIESIN: Roll for it. Roll for it, bro.

04:01:41.670 --> 04:01:44.270
LIAM: More animals. More animals for Vex.

04:01:44.270 --> 04:01:49.190
LAURA: I don't wanna keep it, I just wanna,
I'm the one holding onto it, man.

04:01:49.190 --> 04:01:52.360
TRAVIS: We'll have to tune in next Thursday to see
what it is.

04:01:52.360 --> 04:01:55.700
SAM: Sounds good to me.

04:01:55.700 --> 04:01:57.670
TALIESIN: Stay tuned for another episode of
Critical Role.

04:01:57.670 --> 04:02:02.370
MATT: You're such a terrible person, I love it.
All right, well guys, thank you so much.

04:02:02.370 --> 04:02:04.840
That's the end of this episode, we'll be back
next Thursday.

04:02:04.840 --> 04:02:06.570
MARISHA: Back in Whitestone!

04:02:06.570 --> 04:02:08.140
LAURA: Whitestone!

04:02:08.140 --> 04:02:13.860
MATT: To see what adventures befall Vox Machina in
the next arc of the story. In the meantime,

04:02:13.860 --> 04:02:16.780
thank you for watching, we're gonna get some
sleep.

04:02:16.780 --> 04:02:18.460
Thank you Lootcrate for your awesome
sponsorship.

04:02:18.460 --> 04:02:20.220
ALL: Lootcrate!

04:02:20.220 --> 04:02:28.520
MATT: Thank you Critters for having patience for
our eleven-plus-hour, 11PM later episode tonight.

04:02:28.520 --> 04:02:31.590
Ask you all: Is it Thursday yet?
