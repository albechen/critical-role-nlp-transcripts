00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:10.090
(no audio)

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:12.090
MATT: Welcome back, guys.

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.300
I hope you enjoyed your--
your holiday.

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:16.540
Hope you enjoyed
your new year

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:19.660
and are ready to tackle all the
chaos this year has coming.

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:22.150
Both fists forward.

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:25.060
So, missed you guys.

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:26.630
Last we left off
was a little crazy,

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:28.570
but before we get
to that circumstance,

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.270
let's go ahead and start
with our announcements.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.270
Yay!

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.060
(cheers)

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.270
First and foremost, our
first episode of the year

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.180
is sponsored by us
happy to be back.

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:38.210
We have no
sponsor tonight.

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:39.630
(cheers)

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:40.780
MARISHA: Happiness!

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:43.030
MATT: So sponsored instead
by viewers like you.

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:45.060
So...

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.720
Thank you.

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:49.120
But, yeah, so other
announcements we have.

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:52.540
Me and Marisha will be running
from this episode tonight

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:55.720
to pack and leave at a super
early, pre-dawn flight.

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:58.570
Pretty much, or at
dawn flight, to MAGFest.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:59.750
We'll be there getting
in later tomorrow,

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:01.330
and be there this weekend.

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:02.450
So, those of you who are going
to MAGFest, we'll see you there.

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.239
We have--

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:05.420
LAURA: Is that what it is,
just a lot of magazines?

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:06.660
MATT: Just a lot of magazines.

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:09.780
-TALIESIN: People, US Weekly.
-MARISHA: Oprah.

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.390
MATT: We pretty much got
in there only because

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:13.000
of the article
in Game Informer.

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:15.600
That's the only
reason we were invited.

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.330
No, MAGFest is great.

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.240
We have a Critical Role
panel tomorrow evening

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:21.390
that me and Marisha
will be doing,

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:22.840
and other fun stuff
Saturday and Sunday.

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:24.150
So, look for us
in the schedule

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.150
and we'll look forward
to seeing you guys

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.270
at the actual event.

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:29.390
Travis, you wanted to
mention something real quick?

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.330
TRAVIS: Yes! I wanted to
give a quick shout out

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.240
to Kathy Creshe, Creshaw,

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:36.300
I don't know
how to say it.

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:37.810
TALIESIN: That was a good shout out.

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:39.600
TRAVIS: From Pennsylvania.

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:40.720
SAM: Big fan of the show?

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.150
TRAVIS: We love you,
from us, to you.

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:44.480
-LAURA: We read your email.
-TRAVIS: It was wonderful.

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:46.060
TRAVIS: Sam!

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.630
SAM: Uh, yeah, tonight's sponsor
is Critical Role, as you said,

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:49.810
we have lots of stuff.

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.690
Lots of merchandise
available in the store.

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.300
The logo shirt, mugs,
patches, nail wraps,

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:57.810
hats, key chains, and
necklaces are available

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.600
and if you didn't see it
over the Christmas break,

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.540
we have the
Gilmore shirts and the

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:04.090
"How do you want
to do this?" shirts

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:07.630
and you guys know this,

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:11.690
we have a big Spanish
speaking fan base,

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.330
and I wanted to
give them some love,

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.360
so I thought I'd do our
ad tonight in Spanish.

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.660
Two notes, two notes,
I don't speak Spanish,

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:22.840
and second note
is my neighbor's son

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.000
translated this for me.

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.840
So, he's in Spanish Two.

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.030
Should be pretty basic.

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:30.420
TRAVIS: Not, "He's Spanish too."

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.030
SAM: No, he's-- he's a
sophomore in high school.

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.060
Hola, me llamo Sam Riegel.

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.220
Aquí está mi perro. Se llama Travis Willingham.

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.090
Una broma. ¿Te gustan las camisas t-shirt?

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:51.740
Espero que sí porque tenemos dos camisas
t-shirt para vender en nuestra tienda.

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.000
Una es color morado.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.750
Es para Gilmore's Glorious Goods.

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.090
(laughter)

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.210
La otra no es morado, es gris.

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:06.120
Tiene el slogan de Matthew Mercer,
which is...

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:07.870
¿Como quieres hacer esto?

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.780
(laughter)

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:15.300
No cuestan muchos pesos.

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:16.480
Tu vas a ir internet y comprar ahora.

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:19.150
¡Gracias por favor!

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.450
(applause, cheers)

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.420
-TRAVIS: Muy bien!
-MARISHA: Yay for Spanish Two!

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:27.150
TALIESIN: High school Spanish is
the official language

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:30.030
of Los Angeles, well done.

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:31.630
TRAVIS: A future translator
will then, like, show up?

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:33.660
-SAM: I don't know.
-TALIESIN: It'll be insulted.

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:35.030
Actually, yeah, it'll
actually Google translate

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:37.240
and will be like,
I refuse to even touch this.

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:39.390
SAM: It's for our
Spanish language viewers.

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:40.510
-There are many.
-TRAVIS: That was great.

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.690
MATT: This is true.
Thank you so much.

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:46.720
Anyone else?

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:48.510
Oh, I want to announce
real fast too.

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.180
We received quite a
bit of Critmas gifts

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:53.180
after we had filmed the
Critmas episode last month.

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:56.420
So, as we're slowly retrieving
them from the mailbox,

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:57.780
me, Marisha,
Taliesin, and possibly

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:59.570
anybody that's available
at the time, Liam,

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:02.120
Laura will be
doing a Periscope opening

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:03.270
of the rest of those gifts

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:04.720
in the next couple
of weeks or so.

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:06.240
Be announcing it
ahead of time,

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:08.210
so pay attention to
that, but it is coming.

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:09.240
So, don't worry.

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:10.840
We'll be getting
to your presents

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:15.510
and thanking you for all your
awesome unnecessary generosity.

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:17.420
You're so wonderful

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:19.480
and we'll let you
know once it's happening.

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:20.839
Anybody else have any other
announcements they want to make?

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:23.150
-TRAVIS: Hands up!
-SAM: Uh?

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:24.390
TRAVIS: Hands up!

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:25.840
MATT: Alright, great.

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:27.360
That being the case.

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:29.150
-MARISHA: I don't know--
-LIAM: I don't know what this--

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:32.570
MATT: Let's go ahead
and dive in.

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:37.030
To the first 2017
episode of Critical Role.

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:42.810
TALIESIN: ♪ Do you believe
in life after-- ♪♪

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:51.360
(growling, screaming)

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:59.270
♪

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:01.270
(electricity crackling)

00:05:01.300 --> 00:06:04.780
♪

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:16.030
MATT: Hello, everyone,
and welcome back.

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:19.060
So, getting us up to speed
with the current circumstance

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:22.060
that we left off at
the end of last episode.

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:23.870
Vox Machina,
the main adventurers,

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.270
spending the better
part of this past year

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:29.120
under the shadow of
the Chroma Conclave,

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:30.660
a group of ancient
chromatic dragons

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:32.720
that have
banded together,

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:35.840
seemingly under the banner
of Thordak, The Cinder King,

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:38.720
a great red dragon
that had been sealed

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:41.570
in the fire elemental plane
for a number of years.

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:44.840
Newly released and
carrying with him

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:47.090
what was called
a soul anchor.

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:51.780
A magical artifact made from
the heart of a fire primordial

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:54.150
that had begun to
cause him to mutate

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:57.420
and swell and become something
beyond what he was.

00:06:57.450 --> 00:07:00.180
Also driving him
apparently insane.

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:02.840
As he dominated the
countryside of Tal'Dorei,

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:05.210
along with the
rest of the Conclave,

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:06.690
you gather artifacts
of great power

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:08.120
called the Vestiges
of Divergence

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:11.330
under the guidance
of two sphinx allies.

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:13.630
You travel between
various planes

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:15.090
and gathering
these artifacts

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:18.600
gathered allies and prepared for
this climactic confrontation

00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:20.600
in your home city of Emon,

00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:23.510
now partially brought
to ruin and flame.

00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:25.090
You assembled an army.

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:28.300
You snuck beneath the city.

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:31.450
You arrived within the center
of the Cloudtop district

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:34.750
nearly under the nose of
Thordak's defending hordes,

00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:39.210
and through a climactic
seeming sacrifice

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:41.510
by your friends
Kashaw and Zahra,

00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:43.660
were allowed to pass
directly into the Cloudtop

00:07:43.690 --> 00:07:45.750
heading off Thordak
before he could emerge

00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:48.780
from his subterranean lair

00:07:48.810 --> 00:07:50.360
and lay waste to the armies

00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:53.060
as they pushed inward
towards his lair.

00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:55.180
♪

00:07:55.210 --> 00:07:57.210
TRAVIS: When you say it like that.

00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:58.810
MATT: There you all did battle

00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:03.360
with the great colossal
Thordak, The Cinder King.

00:08:03.390 --> 00:08:06.090
A well prepared
fight rolled out

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:07.480
and while there
was much danger,

00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:10.720
you all persevered and managed
to, using the vestiges,

00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:12.300
destroy the soul anchor

00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:16.240
once it was revealed within the
body of the great red dragon.

00:08:16.270 --> 00:08:19.750
His form rescinding
and withering back

00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:23.480
to its regular,
seemingly withering size.

00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:26.660
You-- it attempted to
flee back into its lair,

00:08:26.690 --> 00:08:30.360
but the rather rapid and
temporarily winged rogue,

00:08:30.390 --> 00:08:31.720
Vax'ildan gave chase and

00:08:31.750 --> 00:08:34.840
dealt a finishing blow
to the great red beast

00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:38.450
midway through its cavern
towards its lair.

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:43.419
There you were joined
briefly by your sister

00:08:43.450 --> 00:08:46.270
and an ally you had made through
this circumstance, Raishan,

00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:48.390
one green dragon.

00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:50.660
The member of the Conclave
that seemingly had made

00:08:50.690 --> 00:08:52.660
a tenuous alliance with you

00:08:52.690 --> 00:08:55.450
as her goal also was
to destroy Thordak.

00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:58.420
Aiding you in the battle,
Raishan followed suit

00:08:58.450 --> 00:09:02.600
and upon the corpse of
Thordak laying cut, bleeding

00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:04.780
and dead in the
center of this cavern,

00:09:04.810 --> 00:09:08.270
she wished to take her end
of the deal you had made.

00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:11.420
To be left alone with
the corpse for a moment

00:09:11.450 --> 00:09:13.180
to acquire some
secret knowledge

00:09:13.210 --> 00:09:17.000
that apparently she was seeking
from the dead dragon.

00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:19.450
Upon releasing the
energy from the scroll

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:23.720
which she had utilized
the incantation from,

00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:27.600
you decided that vengeance
being your oath as a paladin

00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:32.270
and the history that
you have with Keyleth

00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:35.180
and Keyleth's people
that died under the guise

00:09:35.210 --> 00:09:38.120
of Raishan's initial
plotting with Thordak

00:09:38.150 --> 00:09:40.390
to not let this creature
stand and attacked it.

00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:43.480
Both you and your sister, just
as Keyleth began to arrive.

00:09:43.510 --> 00:09:46.090
The rest of the party
slowly staggering behind.

00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:50.060
Raishan sneered and went
further back into the cavern.

00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:53.780
You all gave chase into this
dark, volcanic tunnel system

00:09:53.810 --> 00:09:56.450
which then opened up into
a large, red flaming cavern

00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:59.000
filled with
lava pools and rivers,

00:09:59.030 --> 00:10:03.720
and apparently a
handful of red eggs,

00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:07.570
it looked like scattered
throughout this room.

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:09.870
Thick dark red
crimson scales

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.420
with crystalline formations
pouring out of the sides.

00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:17.120
Very similar to Thordak's
primordial dragon form.

00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:22.000
Upon finding not Raishan,
but just this empty space,

00:10:22.030 --> 00:10:24.390
you looked up
to see a series

00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:27.540
of arcane
summoned meteors

00:10:27.570 --> 00:10:29.210
suddenly given form,

00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:30.570
rocketing from the
ceiling of the cavern

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:33.330
and slamming into the floor

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:36.240
dealing some of you
a pretty dangerous blow

00:10:36.270 --> 00:10:39.210
and sending you scattering
across the floor a bit.

00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:42.210
Vex being thrown
across the way.

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:45.840
You all managed to survive as
at the end of the last battle,

00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:47.330
I'd forgotten that
you had made your save

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:48.660
and you actually, your
bludgeon damage was halved,

00:10:48.690 --> 00:10:53.210
so Vex is conscious,
though still hurting.

00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:56.150
-SAM: ♪ Whoo ♪
-LIAM: ♪ Whoo ♪♪

00:10:56.180 --> 00:10:57.660
MATT: As the dust settles

00:10:57.690 --> 00:11:01.180
and you all take stock of
what had just transpired,

00:11:01.210 --> 00:11:03.780
you see the snout of
the green dragon pull up

00:11:03.810 --> 00:11:05.600
into what appears
to be a series

00:11:05.630 --> 00:11:09.780
of dark volcanic
exhaust tunnels

00:11:09.810 --> 00:11:13.060
that seem to be like
a hive network of--

00:11:13.090 --> 00:11:14.210
of honeycomb type tunnels

00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:17.330
that just spiral off
all through the ceiling,

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:20.000
and that's where we left off
in the last sequence here.

00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:21.810
SAM: Geez, Louise.

00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:25.000
MATT: Which, previously, behind
if I'm--if I'm correct,

00:11:25.030 --> 00:11:27.060
and I believe I am, and
if not, internet, it's fine,

00:11:27.090 --> 00:11:28.630
we'll--we'll do
the narrative.

00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:29.750
We have the three
of you in the room.

00:11:29.780 --> 00:11:31.300
We have Percy, Scanlan,
Pike and Gilmore

00:11:31.330 --> 00:11:33.480
rushing up behind
as fast as they can.

00:11:33.510 --> 00:11:34.540
Grog and Kima
had stayed behind

00:11:34.570 --> 00:11:36.450
to finish up one of
the more recent battles

00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:39.720
and Jarret is
just not going in.

00:11:39.750 --> 00:11:42.030
He is not in a
place to follow suit.

00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:43.690
"You got this, you got this.

00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:45.510
Do not worry, it's okay."

00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:47.150
LIAM: Before we ran into
the bigger chamber,

00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:49.810
Gilmore and Jarret had caught up
with us if I remember correctly.

00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:50.810
MATT: No, they did not.

00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:52.510
LAURA: Oh, they hadn't
gotten to us.

00:11:52.540 --> 00:11:53.810
LIAM: I remember
that they did.

00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:57.060
MATT: No, they would have gotten
into the chamber with you.

00:11:57.090 --> 00:11:58.810
Only the three of you
made it into the chamber.

00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:00.150
LIAM: That's what I mean.

00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:01.300
MATT: They got into the tunnel,

00:12:01.330 --> 00:12:03.480
but they hadn't
got up to your guys.

00:12:03.510 --> 00:12:04.810
The speed in which
you guys all got there

00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:06.480
was basically just Raishan
and the three of you,

00:12:06.510 --> 00:12:07.870
then the
attack happened.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.060
Raishan rushed in,
you rush after her.

00:12:10.090 --> 00:12:14.420
Everyone else has kinda
been left in the dust.

00:12:14.450 --> 00:12:15.840
They're not too
far behind you,

00:12:15.870 --> 00:12:19.750
but things be as they may.

00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:23.510
We begin tonight's episode

00:12:23.540 --> 00:12:24.780
at this next
round of combat.

00:12:24.810 --> 00:12:26.180
Continuing
where we last did.

00:12:26.210 --> 00:12:28.000
LAURA: Oh, God, oh God!

00:12:28.030 --> 00:12:30.420
-MARISHA: Jesus Christ.
-TRAVIS: Oh God, oh God, oh God.

00:12:30.450 --> 00:12:32.390
-MATT: So--
-SAM: Why from there?

00:12:32.420 --> 00:12:37.180
You're fine.

00:12:37.210 --> 00:12:41.660
-TALIESIN: No, stop, don't.
-MARISHA: Yeah, police.

00:12:41.690 --> 00:12:43.360
MATT: So, at the top of
this combat round,

00:12:43.390 --> 00:12:46.300
technically, Percy, you
have the initiative on this.

00:12:46.330 --> 00:12:49.150
You are continuing to push
through this-- this hallway.

00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:51.270
You haven't quite even,
at a double dash,

00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:54.000
you can hear explosions
in the distance

00:12:54.030 --> 00:12:57.030
and then you guys watch as
suddenly smoke, silt and ash

00:12:57.060 --> 00:13:00.780
come flying through
the tunnel from within

00:13:00.810 --> 00:13:03.630
immediately followed by the
sound of these large, heavy,

00:13:03.660 --> 00:13:05.690
banging explosions.

00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:07.360
Some sort of heavy impact,

00:13:07.390 --> 00:13:10.420
a series of impacts seem to have
detonated deep within the tunnel

00:13:10.450 --> 00:13:12.840
and immediately set everyone
in the vicinity on edge

00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:15.720
knowing that something
is still transpiring

00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:20.090
in a very dangerous way
deeper within this tunnel.

00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:24.120
TALIESIN: I am throwing on my mask and
I am running into the room.

00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:26.630
I'm actually gonna
be spider crawling.

00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:30.390
I'm gonna be on the-- on
the walls so that I'm-- yeah.

00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:32.210
I don't want to be in the line
of anything that happens.

00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:33.300
MARISHA: That's awesome.

00:13:33.330 --> 00:13:37.870
LIAM: Spider Percy's
my favorite Percy.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:39.120
MATT: It's just the feet, Percy.

00:13:39.150 --> 00:13:42.750
MARISHA: ♪ Spider Percy,
Spider Percy ♪♪

00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:45.270
MATT: You can if you want,
if you really want to.

00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:46.480
SAM: He's like
walking like this?

00:13:46.510 --> 00:13:47.480
-MATT: Yeah.
-TALIESIN:Running.

00:13:47.510 --> 00:13:49.480
SAM: Cool!

00:13:49.510 --> 00:13:52.570
TALIESIN: This ain't Dr. Strange,
this is--

00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:55.270
LIAM: He's doing this and
nothing's happening.

00:13:55.300 --> 00:13:58.120
TALIESIN: Out of fluid, you know.

00:13:58.150 --> 00:13:59.570
LIAM: If anyone can make it,
it's you.

00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:03.870
TALIESIN: I know, I got to make-- I got
to make Spider-- Spider Percy.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:05.420
MATT: So, anyway,
that ends your turn.

00:14:05.450 --> 00:14:07.840
You--you run past
on the side of the wall,

00:14:07.870 --> 00:14:10.510
as the ash begins to settle
around you as you run past,

00:14:10.540 --> 00:14:12.210
kind of preparing your weapons
for a coming confrontation,

00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:13.600
you glance out to your right

00:14:13.630 --> 00:14:17.420
and see there the smoldering
wreckage of red scales

00:14:17.450 --> 00:14:22.330
and dragon blood that was once
Thordak, the cinder king.

00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:24.030
You see that and
down it's about--

00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:25.450
You keep running.

00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:27.840
You can see a gentle glimmer in
the distance of a battlefield,

00:14:27.870 --> 00:14:29.090
but you're not
quite there yet.

00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:31.300
TALIESIN: Okay.

00:14:31.330 --> 00:14:32.540
MATT: Okay, the top
of the round.

00:14:32.570 --> 00:14:36.840
The three of you finding
yourselves in this circumstance.

00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:38.390
We go to the lair actions.

00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:39.540
So, these lair actions are--

00:14:39.570 --> 00:14:41.060
LAURA: Oh God.

00:14:41.090 --> 00:14:43.690
MATT: Of Thordak's lair, as this
is not Raishan's lair,

00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:45.120
but even though
Thordak is dead,

00:14:45.150 --> 00:14:48.270
the lair itself
has its own natural,

00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:50.060
naturally
occurring dangers.

00:14:50.090 --> 00:14:53.270
-TRAVIS: Damn it!
-MATT: So.

00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:54.300
SAM: What?

00:14:54.330 --> 00:14:56.270
That don't make
no sense, man.

00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:58.300
Thordak's dead.

00:14:58.330 --> 00:14:59.810
His lair dies with him.

00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:01.330
MATT: Over time!

00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:03.120
Maybe, you don't know.

00:15:03.150 --> 00:15:04.810
TRAVIS: His home security
system still pays for it.

00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:06.270
-LAURA: Yeah.
-MATT: Exactly, yeah.

00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:09.660
It's-- it's on a recurring
subscription plan.

00:15:09.690 --> 00:15:10.780
So, there will be--

00:15:10.810 --> 00:15:12.330
TALIESIN: How do I pee?

00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:15.570
MATT: The lava that you had
just landed across.

00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:17.750
So, Vex'ahlia, as you are
knocked from the explosions

00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:19.390
of the meteors from
landing on your back,

00:15:19.420 --> 00:15:22.030
and just barely getting
back up to your feet,

00:15:22.060 --> 00:15:25.090
your vision comes back as
you see the stream of lava

00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:26.870
that's just
barely pouring past.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.090
Very slowly begins to...

00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:31.330
LAURA: I back up, I back up.

00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:35.330
MATT: As it opens and sprays
here at 20 foot radius.

00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:37.600
LAURA: I climb back up
and I bump an egg.

00:15:37.630 --> 00:15:42.090
MATT: I'm going to bring
out my templates.

00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:43.240
TALIESIN: No.

00:15:43.270 --> 00:15:45.000
LAURA: This is gonna
kill me, isn't it?

00:15:45.030 --> 00:15:47.180
MATT: This will explode
and all three of you--

00:15:47.210 --> 00:15:49.090
I need you all three to make
dexterity saving throws.

00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:51.120
-MARISHA: Oh, boy.
-TALIESIN: Yay.

00:15:51.150 --> 00:15:53.690
MARISHA: This is great.

00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:55.510
LAURA: Cool.

00:15:55.540 --> 00:15:57.270
This is-- is this--

00:15:57.300 --> 00:15:59.780
TALIESIN: First roll of 2017.

00:15:59.810 --> 00:16:02.300
-LAURA: Oh, wait, I'm hasted.
-MARISHA: Twenty total.

00:16:02.330 --> 00:16:04.360
-SAM: Twenty total's good.
-MARISHA: Yeah!

00:16:07.870 --> 00:16:10.330
-LAURA: Seven.
-LIAM: Twenty-seven.

00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:12.600
MATT: Okay, that's fine.

00:16:12.630 --> 00:16:16.150
So, as it is a hotter, more
dangerous vicinity here,

00:16:16.180 --> 00:16:18.450
the damage is higher, but you
all managed to make your saves,

00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:19.600
so you're only
taking half damage

00:16:19.630 --> 00:16:21.630
as you all avoid from
the spray of magma

00:16:21.660 --> 00:16:25.120
that just bursts out and
splashes in your area.

00:16:25.150 --> 00:16:27.270
LIAM: Evasion keeps me
at zero, yeah?

00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:31.270
MATT: Yes, because you have
your rogue evasionness,

00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:33.150
and it's
three ones, alright.

00:16:33.180 --> 00:16:34.660
-LAURA: Yay.
-TALIESIN: Yay.

00:16:34.690 --> 00:16:37.570
MATT: So, that'll be 18 points of
fire damage reduced to nine.

00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:40.570
(indistinguishable dialogue)

00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:42.480
MARISHA: I mean, I'm not, you know.

00:16:42.510 --> 00:16:44.570
-LAURA: Still terrified.
-MARISHA: Taking it for granted.

00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:46.870
(talking over each other)

00:16:50.870 --> 00:16:52.810
Yeah, yeah,
something like that.

00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:54.540
Or five, it's debatable.

00:16:54.570 --> 00:16:56.420
Depends on the
health of the people.

00:16:56.450 --> 00:16:59.630
MATT: Next up in the initiative
order is Raishan.

00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:00.810
LAURA: Oh, good.

00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:02.270
MATT: So, as the splash happens,

00:17:02.300 --> 00:17:04.060
you glance up and you
can see what looks to be

00:17:04.089 --> 00:17:07.300
a series of maybe a dozen or
so of these volcanic lava tubes

00:17:07.329 --> 00:17:09.750
that kind of are these--

00:17:09.780 --> 00:17:13.240
these caverns roughly the
size of a very low live,

00:17:13.270 --> 00:17:16.390
kind of pushed in
cat-like Raishan.

00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:19.270
You see the head and the tail
kind of hanging out the side

00:17:19.300 --> 00:17:22.119
as Raishan begins
to mutter some sort

00:17:22.150 --> 00:17:23.690
of an incantation
under her breath.

00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:24.750
You hear the echo...

00:17:24.780 --> 00:17:26.240
(whispering incantation)

00:17:26.270 --> 00:17:29.540
Between the room as it kind
of quivers for a second.

00:17:29.570 --> 00:17:33.390
And her form
just vanishes.

00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:34.840
TRAVIS: Damn it.

00:17:34.870 --> 00:17:37.030
LIAM: But we saw where she was
before she went into--

00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:38.270
MATT: You did.

00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:39.480
SAM: Fight over, that's it.

00:17:39.510 --> 00:17:40.480
That's great.

00:17:40.510 --> 00:17:42.570
LAURA: Oh my God, she--
she ran away.

00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:46.390
SAM: Alright, let's mop
up here and go home.

00:17:46.420 --> 00:17:48.060
TRAVIS: Punk ass, Raishan.

00:17:48.090 --> 00:17:51.720
MARISHA: The air ate her.

00:17:51.750 --> 00:17:53.420
MATT: I guarantee you that's
probably not the case.

00:17:53.450 --> 00:17:55.360
No.

00:17:55.390 --> 00:17:56.600
TRAVIS: You're saying
there's a chance.

00:17:56.630 --> 00:17:59.630
MATT: Yes.

00:17:59.660 --> 00:18:00.840
Alrighty.

00:18:00.870 --> 00:18:04.570
MARISHA: Dude.

00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:06.420
TALIESIN: Just shunned her
into invisibility.

00:18:06.450 --> 00:18:07.600
MATT: Great.

00:18:07.630 --> 00:18:09.570
That brings us next
to Keyleth's turn.

00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:11.240
LAURA: Keyleth, just kill her.

00:18:11.270 --> 00:18:12.720
Find her and kill
her so we can get--

00:18:12.750 --> 00:18:14.300
MARISHA: Whereabouts
was she last?

00:18:14.330 --> 00:18:17.810
MATT: Last you saw was up
in this cavernous area

00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:21.810
roughly in this
portion of the ceiling.

00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:24.570
MARISHA: But we can assume she probably
went invisible and then moved.

00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:25.870
LIAM: Yeah.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:27.270
MARISHA: I could do Faerie Fire on her,

00:18:27.300 --> 00:18:28.330
but I mean, I don't
know where she is

00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:29.390
and it's a 20 foot cube.

00:18:29.420 --> 00:18:31.660
It'd probably be a waste.

00:18:31.690 --> 00:18:35.690
So, instead, I'm going
to cast Call Lightning

00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:37.840
at fourth level,

00:18:37.870 --> 00:18:40.840
and go fire elemental.

00:18:40.870 --> 00:18:42.690
MATT: Okay.

00:18:45.810 --> 00:18:48.180
-SAM: How's that work?
-LAURA: It's an ongoing--

00:18:48.210 --> 00:18:50.120
Lightning is an ongoing--

00:18:50.150 --> 00:18:51.690
MARISHA: Yeah, it's a concentration.

00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:53.390
Yeah, I can make it--

00:18:53.420 --> 00:18:55.030
SAM: So it just exists there?

00:18:55.060 --> 00:18:56.420
-Ready to strike?
-TALIESIN: Like a ghostbuster.

00:18:56.450 --> 00:18:57.690
SAM: Cool.

00:18:57.720 --> 00:19:00.630
MATT: So, as you watch
Keyleth's eyes flare

00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:04.060
with this bright electric
kind of blue yellow light,

00:19:04.090 --> 00:19:06.450
as the ash and bit of dust

00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:08.240
that has been kind of
plummeting from the ceiling

00:19:08.270 --> 00:19:10.090
from the impact of
the meteor swarms

00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:13.210
and the movement of some
now not seeable dragon

00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:15.330
amongst the ceiling caverns.

00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:17.180
It gathers into
this swirling storm

00:19:17.210 --> 00:19:20.000
that begins to build
and form across the top

00:19:20.030 --> 00:19:21.630
domed portion
of this cavern.

00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:24.670
As it does, you watch bolts
of electricity...

00:19:25.510 --> 00:19:28.210
Arc through the storm
as Keyleth's form

00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:32.600
then whooshes into a burst
swirl of flaming energy.

00:19:32.630 --> 00:19:36.660
Her physical body now becoming
a swirling fire elemental.

00:19:36.690 --> 00:19:39.060
You wish to move or you're
gonna stay where you are?

00:19:39.090 --> 00:19:42.480
MARISHA: I'm going to take a few
steps back and-- question.

00:19:42.510 --> 00:19:45.150
Can I look up
and see if, like,

00:19:45.180 --> 00:19:49.510
the clouds are kind of shaping
around like a, you know,

00:19:49.540 --> 00:19:53.450
roughly
dragon shaped body?

00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:54.690
That make sense?

00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:56.570
TALIESIN: She's looking for
disturbances of the force.

00:19:56.600 --> 00:19:58.540
MATT: Sure.

00:19:58.570 --> 00:20:01.660
MARISHA: You gave me that
"this is bullshit" look.

00:20:01.690 --> 00:20:03.090
TALIESIN: Roll a 29.

00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:04.330
MARISHA: Oh, that's not bad.

00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:05.510
With perception,
perception.

00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:07.210
Sorry, I'm so nervous, 26.

00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:08.510
MATT: Twenty-six.

00:20:08.540 --> 00:20:10.810
Glancing about between
the dust that's falling,

00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:12.600
the movement of the storm
that you've gathered

00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:14.240
at the roof of the ceiling,

00:20:14.270 --> 00:20:16.060
you don't see anything
that identifies

00:20:16.090 --> 00:20:17.840
the location
of a dragon now.

00:20:17.870 --> 00:20:19.300
MARISHA: Yeah, so it's fine.

00:20:19.330 --> 00:20:20.750
So, I'll take a
few steps back.

00:20:20.780 --> 00:20:22.970
MATT: So you're
about right there?

00:20:23.630 --> 00:20:24.810
MARISHA: Yeah, oh, oh.

00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:26.270
TALIESIN: Wow, it's
weirdly mirrored.

00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:27.270
Okay, that
took me a second.

00:20:27.300 --> 00:20:28.480
-MARISHA: It's totally mirrored.
-TALIESIN: Yeah!

00:20:28.510 --> 00:20:29.690
LAURA: Oh!

00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:31.300
-TALIESIN: Yeah, I know, cool.
-LIAM: Your screen is flipped.

00:20:31.330 --> 00:20:33.000
-LAURA: That's crazy.
-MARISHA: It's fine.

00:20:33.030 --> 00:20:34.030
It's not a problem.

00:20:34.060 --> 00:20:35.300
TALIESIN: We have the
same view you do.

00:20:35.330 --> 00:20:36.510
LAURA: It's actually, no,
I think it's better,

00:20:36.540 --> 00:20:37.750
because we're looking at
it from his perspective.

00:20:37.780 --> 00:20:39.030
TALIESIN: So, we can say
like, "move us down,"

00:20:39.060 --> 00:20:40.090
and they'll be
towards him now.

00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:41.540
Yeah.

00:20:41.570 --> 00:20:44.510
-MARISHA: I'm sorry, so move me--
-MATT: Further in?

00:20:44.540 --> 00:20:47.330
MARISHA: Yeah, down-- down.

00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:49.150
SAM: Towards the lava
or away from the lava?

00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:50.780
MARISHA: Right there,
down one more.

00:20:50.810 --> 00:20:52.180
-Other way.
-TALIESIN: South.

00:20:52.210 --> 00:20:53.570
-LAURA: Oh my God.
-MARISHA: South.

00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:55.240
Yeah, that's good,
that's-- that's good.

00:20:55.270 --> 00:20:57.360
-TALIESIN: There.
-MATT: Good, alright.

00:20:57.390 --> 00:20:58.420
LAURA: Where's our pointer?

00:20:58.450 --> 00:20:59.870
MATT: Where's your
laser pointers guys?

00:20:59.890 --> 00:21:01.360
TALIESIN: Where are our pointers?

00:21:01.390 --> 00:21:03.570
We need new pointers.

00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:04.720
LAURA: It's been
three weeks, Matt.

00:21:04.750 --> 00:21:05.840
MATT: It has been, I know.

00:21:05.870 --> 00:21:07.030
SAM: We've forgotten how to play.

00:21:07.060 --> 00:21:08.030
MATT: That's okay.

00:21:08.060 --> 00:21:09.030
Alright, so--

00:21:09.060 --> 00:21:10.150
MARISHA: It's like inverted controls.

00:21:10.180 --> 00:21:11.660
TALIESIN: I'm taking Diva.

00:21:11.690 --> 00:21:12.810
MATT: Now, is that your turn?

00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:14.030
MARISHA: Yes.

00:21:14.060 --> 00:21:15.870
MATT: Alright, finishing
Keyleth's turn.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.240
That brings us to Gilmore
who's rushing up past--

00:21:18.270 --> 00:21:20.540
LAURA: Come on, Gilmore.

00:21:20.570 --> 00:21:23.750
MATT: Keeping up his pace
as much as he can.

00:21:23.780 --> 00:21:25.480
"Oh, boy.

00:21:25.510 --> 00:21:28.630
I know you guys take
me to the nicest places."

00:21:28.660 --> 00:21:30.570
And he's just
jogging as best he can.

00:21:30.570 --> 00:21:32.270
Rushing into the ash cloud

00:21:32.300 --> 00:21:35.030
as another one pushes through.

00:21:35.060 --> 00:21:37.210
Some of the wind
tending to push

00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:41.600
and causing swirling little
dust devils of ash and cinder.

00:21:41.630 --> 00:21:44.720
That's gonna
end his turn.

00:21:44.750 --> 00:21:45.870
Vex, you're up.

00:21:45.870 --> 00:21:47.000
LAURA: Oh.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:49.550
-MATT: So you glance up.
-LAURA: I glance up.

00:21:49.550 --> 00:21:52.030
MATT: You see all this happening,
what are you gonna do?

00:21:52.030 --> 00:21:54.510
LAURA: I'm gonna get on my broom.

00:21:54.540 --> 00:21:56.150
TALIESIN: Get on up.

00:21:56.180 --> 00:22:00.570
LAURA: And I'm gonna
take a health potion.

00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:02.910
-MATT: Okay.
-LAURA: So...

00:22:02.910 --> 00:22:04.300
MATT: Regular health potion?

00:22:04.330 --> 00:22:06.420
LAURA: I have a Greater.

00:22:06.450 --> 00:22:07.720
-MATT: Okay.
-LAURA: I have one Greater.

00:22:07.750 --> 00:22:08.780
So, that's a what?

00:22:08.810 --> 00:22:10.750
4d8?

00:22:10.780 --> 00:22:13.480
MATT: A Greater is 4d4 plus four.

00:22:17.150 --> 00:22:19.770
Remember you guys
are pretty low

00:22:19.770 --> 00:22:21.780
on any powerful
potions at this point.

00:22:21.810 --> 00:22:23.330
You used most
of them, so, yeah.

00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:26.560
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, I had
a Greater left.

00:22:28.270 --> 00:22:30.090
It's jack shit.

00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:32.240
Ten, ten whole points.

00:22:32.270 --> 00:22:35.090
MATT: There you go,
ten points of healing.

00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:37.390
On your broom.

00:22:37.420 --> 00:22:41.570
LAURA: I'm gonna go back
towards the entrance.

00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:43.030
Post up to the entrance,

00:22:43.060 --> 00:22:47.420
like off the ground
as far as I can get.

00:22:47.420 --> 00:22:49.390
MATT: That's about as
far as you can get.

00:22:49.420 --> 00:22:51.660
You want to stay hovering or
just like there on the ground?

00:22:51.660 --> 00:22:53.000
LAURA: Hovering!

00:22:53.030 --> 00:22:55.390
Stay off the ground
and can I--

00:22:55.420 --> 00:22:57.570
MATT: Are you going up
ten feet or 20 feet

00:22:57.600 --> 00:22:59.510
or are you staying
just above the ground

00:22:59.510 --> 00:23:01.180
so you're not
standing on it?

00:23:01.210 --> 00:23:02.330
LAURA: I'm gonna go up ten feet.

00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:03.930
MATT: Okay.

00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:08.480
LAURA: And if I can be a little bit
further away from Keyleth,

00:23:08.510 --> 00:23:09.510
that'd be clutch.

00:23:09.540 --> 00:23:10.720
MATT: Okay.

00:23:10.750 --> 00:23:12.760
LAURA: I mean, I don't know
if it'd be clutch,

00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:15.030
but it would be helpful.

00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:17.150
Can I look up,

00:23:17.180 --> 00:23:20.240
and see if
I can see like,

00:23:20.270 --> 00:23:23.120
dust coming down
from any of the holes,

00:23:23.150 --> 00:23:25.760
to see if Raishan is moving around

00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:27.510
in the holes
on the ceiling--

00:23:27.540 --> 00:23:29.060
MATT: Roll a perception check.

00:23:29.090 --> 00:23:30.390
LIAM: There's a storm cloud.

00:23:30.420 --> 00:23:32.090
LAURA: I know, I know.

00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:33.210
Is this
pertaining to dragons

00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:35.670
so I would
get advantage?

00:23:37.210 --> 00:23:38.640
MATT: Sure.

00:23:40.450 --> 00:23:42.690
-LAURA: That's the same thing.
-LIAM: Two 13's.

00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:45.240
LAURA: So, perception,
so that's 26.

00:23:45.270 --> 00:23:47.660
MATT: Okay, so glancing
about, unfortunately,

00:23:47.690 --> 00:23:49.810
the gathering of the
Call Lightning cloud

00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:53.090
combined with the other
dark ash-filled interior,

00:23:53.090 --> 00:23:55.240
you don't see anything
that signifies

00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:56.810
the location
of a dragon.

00:23:56.840 --> 00:23:58.540
You do glance over
and you notice

00:23:58.570 --> 00:24:00.240
that where you
landed previously,

00:24:00.270 --> 00:24:03.020
one of the eggs was pretty
much just destroyed by this--

00:24:03.020 --> 00:24:05.240
'cause it was the area
of the meteor swarm

00:24:05.240 --> 00:24:06.630
where you guys were hit.

00:24:06.660 --> 00:24:07.780
So, all gathered here,

00:24:07.810 --> 00:24:09.390
so this egg right here
by where you were,

00:24:09.420 --> 00:24:12.870
is currently just crushed
inward and filled with rock.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:15.070
-MARISHA: And--
-LAURA: Really?

00:24:15.070 --> 00:24:16.770
Is there anything
oozing out of it?

00:24:16.770 --> 00:24:18.240
MARISHA: Yeah, what's--

00:24:18.270 --> 00:24:19.450
LAURA: I should have
looked at it before.

00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:21.180
MATT: It's hard to see,
it's far away,

00:24:21.210 --> 00:24:23.480
but it looks like the
egg has been destroyed.

00:24:23.510 --> 00:24:25.660
-LAURA: Destroyed?
-SAM: Destroyed?

00:24:25.690 --> 00:24:27.180
LAURA: She doesn't care
about the eggs.

00:24:27.210 --> 00:24:28.870
SAM: Or she didn't destroy it.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:30.720
LIAM: Not the Mama!

00:24:31.630 --> 00:24:34.030
LAURA: Okay, so I've got--
I'm so sorry.

00:24:34.060 --> 00:24:35.390
MARISHA: That's true.

00:24:35.420 --> 00:24:37.720
TRAVIS: So, it's covered with rocks.

00:24:37.750 --> 00:24:38.780
LAURA: I don't know
where my notes are

00:24:38.810 --> 00:24:40.630
to see what my
spells were from before.

00:24:40.660 --> 00:24:43.890
I didn't have it set up
cause I'm a horrible person.

00:24:43.890 --> 00:24:45.600
MARISHA: But that was
from the lair action.

00:24:45.630 --> 00:24:47.190
SAM: Yeah, that wasn't her.

00:24:47.190 --> 00:24:49.150
LAURA: Okay, this is--
this is the last one.

00:24:49.180 --> 00:24:51.030
Oh, I didn't do like
any spells before.

00:24:51.060 --> 00:24:54.240
So, I'm gonna cast--

00:24:54.270 --> 00:24:56.480
I'm gonna cast
Cure Wounds on myself.

00:24:56.510 --> 00:24:57.480
MATT: Okay.

00:24:57.510 --> 00:25:00.060
What level?

00:25:00.090 --> 00:25:01.480
MARISHA: Yeah, but does she
care or even not care?

00:25:01.510 --> 00:25:02.540
TALIESIN: We'll find out.

00:25:02.570 --> 00:25:03.810
LAURA: I'm gonna cast
it at third level.

00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:06.720
MATT: Okay.

00:25:06.750 --> 00:25:10.330
LAURA: So, that's 1d8-- 2d8 plus
my spell casting modifier.

00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:12.210
-MATT: So, a 3d8 technically.
-LAURA: 3d8?

00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:14.230
MATT: Cause if you're
casting at third level,

00:25:14.230 --> 00:25:15.990
it's 3d8 plus your spell modifier.

00:25:15.990 --> 00:25:17.750
LAURA: Okay.

00:25:17.750 --> 00:25:19.300
TRAVIS: That's good,
that's good, that's good.

00:25:19.330 --> 00:25:21.150
MARISHA: This is turning into
a Jerry Springer episode.

00:25:21.180 --> 00:25:23.090
Is she or is
she not the mom?

00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:26.300
LAURA: No, my modifier, which is my wisdom.

00:25:26.330 --> 00:25:28.210
Ten plus--

00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:30.090
Jesus Christ,
I'm sorry!

00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:31.120
Ten plus--

00:25:31.150 --> 00:25:32.240
TALIESIN: Three weeks, man.

00:25:32.270 --> 00:25:33.630
LAURA: Thirteen points heal.

00:25:33.660 --> 00:25:34.870
MARISHA: It's like riding a bike,
riding a bike.

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:36.450
LIAM: Three weeks to
stew, everybody.

00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:37.450
MATT: Alright, there you go.

00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:39.060
At the end of your turn--

00:25:39.090 --> 00:25:40.600
Actually she's gonna do--

00:25:40.630 --> 00:25:42.840
TALIESIN: It's like riding a
bike with pen and paper.

00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:44.450
MATT: Okay.

00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:46.270
You feel this strange,

00:25:46.300 --> 00:25:49.040
sudden warm tingling sensation

00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:51.720
separate from the healing spell
just in your vicinity.

00:25:51.750 --> 00:25:55.100
Almost like a warm breeze
just kind of passes through you.

00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:57.330
That's it.

00:25:57.360 --> 00:25:59.030
-SAM: Oh, boy.
-MATT: End of your turn.

00:25:59.060 --> 00:26:01.060
-SAM: What does that mean?
-LAURA: I don't know.

00:26:01.090 --> 00:26:02.510
SAM: You've been
cursed forever.

00:26:02.540 --> 00:26:04.660
-TRAVIS: It's a bloody fart.
-TALIESIN: Farting dragon.

00:26:04.690 --> 00:26:06.690
Invisible
farting dragon.

00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:09.210
LAURA: What if that
was a baby dragon?

00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:10.570
LIAM: I'm gonna take to the air.

00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:13.330
I'm going to-- do I
still feel hasted yet?

00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:15.840
MATT: You-- yes, you do.

00:26:15.870 --> 00:26:18.240
LIAM: I'm going to
fly past my sister

00:26:18.270 --> 00:26:22.120
and slap the one Greater healing
potion I have into her palm.

00:26:22.150 --> 00:26:23.760
LAURA: Oh, thank you.

00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:25.240
LIAM: Oh, Superior,
excuse me.

00:26:25.270 --> 00:26:27.570
LAURA: What?!

00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:29.810
LIAM: And then
I'm going to

00:26:30.870 --> 00:26:34.690
curve around over Keyleth

00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:38.150
and stab the egg there with
the Dragon Slayer blade.

00:26:38.150 --> 00:26:39.730
-SAM: Oh, boy.
-MATT: This one?

00:26:39.730 --> 00:26:41.000
-LIAM: Yes.
-MATT: Okay.

00:26:41.030 --> 00:26:43.030
SAM: Stabbing eggs?

00:26:43.060 --> 00:26:45.310
TALIESIN: That should give you a
Dragon Slayer bonus also.

00:26:45.310 --> 00:26:47.070
MATT: Go ahead and
roll for attack.

00:26:47.070 --> 00:26:48.660
TRAVIS: Isn't that poaching?

00:26:48.690 --> 00:26:51.360
LIAM: That is 29.

00:26:51.390 --> 00:26:53.120
MATT: That hits.

00:26:53.150 --> 00:26:55.210
SAM: Go home Travis, you're drunk.

00:26:55.240 --> 00:26:57.550
TRAVIS: I'm working on it.

00:26:57.550 --> 00:26:59.710
LAURA: The babies will
help us though.

00:26:59.710 --> 00:27:02.360
What if the
babies are cute?

00:27:02.390 --> 00:27:04.870
-Can we raise them?
-TALIESIN: No.

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:07.060
MARISHA: You want to try and
Daenerys this shit?

00:27:07.090 --> 00:27:10.480
TALIESIN: We can raise them
by setting them on fire.

00:27:10.510 --> 00:27:12.510
MARISHA: We each get one, you guys.

00:27:12.540 --> 00:27:13.720
LIAM: Twenty-six.

00:27:13.750 --> 00:27:15.450
MATT: Twenty-six
points of damage.

00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:17.300
Alright, you take the
blade as you rush up

00:27:17.330 --> 00:27:18.300
and then hack through it.

00:27:18.330 --> 00:27:20.120
The blade only
gets a few inches

00:27:20.150 --> 00:27:22.240
into the tough outer
exterior of this egg

00:27:22.270 --> 00:27:23.660
and you have to push
and carve through

00:27:23.690 --> 00:27:26.000
and you do carve a--

00:27:26.030 --> 00:27:29.570
a sliver through the egg's shell
and a little bit of

00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:32.600
deep, brownish-maroon liquid

00:27:32.630 --> 00:27:35.450
begins to spill out
of it, but that's--

00:27:35.450 --> 00:27:37.720
it's not a heavy amount
of damage to the egg.

00:27:37.750 --> 00:27:40.750
LIAM: I'm gonna take Whisper
and take that further.

00:27:40.780 --> 00:27:43.750
MATT: Go ahead and roll for a
secondary attack.

00:27:43.780 --> 00:27:46.610
-LIAM: That is 28 to hit.
-MATT: 28, that hits.

00:27:49.630 --> 00:27:53.450
I'll mark the eggs that
are damaged and destroyed.

00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:54.930
This one is...

00:27:55.720 --> 00:27:58.390
LIAM: That's a total of 15.

00:27:58.420 --> 00:28:00.180
MATT: Oh, that's not
working too well.

00:28:00.210 --> 00:28:02.150
Good to know. Total of what?

00:28:02.180 --> 00:28:04.630
-LIAM: Fifteen.
-MATT: Fifteen, okay.

00:28:04.660 --> 00:28:07.390
With that much damage, the egg
begins to crack even further.

00:28:07.420 --> 00:28:08.750
More of the liquid
begins to spill.

00:28:08.780 --> 00:28:10.360
The blade pulls through
and you can see,

00:28:10.390 --> 00:28:12.480
as you tear a chunk
of the actual shell

00:28:12.510 --> 00:28:14.510
of this egg off
and it falls,

00:28:14.540 --> 00:28:17.740
you have punctured some
sort of thick amniotic sac.

00:28:17.740 --> 00:28:20.030
That's what the fluid
that's spilling out of it,

00:28:20.060 --> 00:28:22.030
but you haven't
seemingly touched

00:28:22.060 --> 00:28:23.860
any sort of flesh
or creature within,

00:28:23.860 --> 00:28:26.690
but the egg is currently has
a section that is exposed.

00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:29.180
LIAM: And I have--if
I'm still hasted,

00:28:29.210 --> 00:28:30.540
I have a lot of
movement left,

00:28:30.570 --> 00:28:33.480
so I'm going
to fly and hover

00:28:33.510 --> 00:28:37.570
about 15 feet above
the egg towards you,

00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:39.720
towards your DM tape
on the side there.

00:28:39.750 --> 00:28:41.210
-MATT: Over here?
-LIAM: Yeah.

00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:42.360
MATT: Okay.

00:28:42.390 --> 00:28:44.480
LIAM: Fifteen feet
in the air.

00:28:44.510 --> 00:28:47.510
♪

00:28:47.540 --> 00:28:51.030
I have 120 feet of
movement total hasted.

00:28:51.060 --> 00:28:52.510
LAURA: So, we were lining up?

00:28:52.540 --> 00:28:54.630
We're seriously lining up?

00:28:54.660 --> 00:28:56.120
LIAM: No, I'm all the
way over there.

00:28:56.150 --> 00:28:57.690
-LAURA: No, you're in a line.
-LIAM: That's not where I want to be.

00:28:57.720 --> 00:28:58.740
I want to be--

00:28:58.740 --> 00:29:01.390
MATT: I know, I'm-- I'm calculating
how much movement you have.

00:29:01.390 --> 00:29:02.720
LIAM: I'm arguing with
her, not you.

00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:04.370
MATT: Ah, no worries.

00:29:04.370 --> 00:29:07.140
LIAM: Cause that's what we do
cause we love each other.

00:29:07.720 --> 00:29:09.300
MATT: You can get
right there.

00:29:09.330 --> 00:29:10.480
LIAM: Okay.

00:29:10.510 --> 00:29:12.030
Fifteen feet
in the air.

00:29:12.060 --> 00:29:13.620
MATT: Fifteen feet
in the air?

00:29:13.620 --> 00:29:16.300
LIAM: That's not the egg that
I'm talking about though.

00:29:16.330 --> 00:29:17.840
LAURA: Look, I'm talking about--

00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:20.330
LIAM: I'm talking about
the egg closer to Matt.

00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:22.490
LAURA: Yes, there it is.

00:29:22.490 --> 00:29:23.920
-LIAM: There.
-LAURA: That one!

00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:25.240
LIAM: This is where
I want to go.

00:29:25.270 --> 00:29:27.000
LAURA: That's where
you are, dude.

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:28.000
LIAM: That's over there?

00:29:28.030 --> 00:29:29.450
LAURA: Yeah, it's reverse.

00:29:29.480 --> 00:29:32.150
LIAM: It's the--it's the
flip screen is--

00:29:32.180 --> 00:29:33.270
I don't want
to go there.

00:29:33.300 --> 00:29:36.120
I want to go across
from everybody.

00:29:36.150 --> 00:29:37.330
It's the flip.

00:29:37.360 --> 00:29:38.630
SAM: Guys, just don't
look at the TV.

00:29:38.660 --> 00:29:40.120
Look at the screen.

00:29:40.150 --> 00:29:42.060
MATT: Over this way?

00:29:42.090 --> 00:29:43.150
TRAVIS: Closer, Matt?

00:29:43.180 --> 00:29:45.030
LIAM: I'm gonna kill you all.

00:29:45.060 --> 00:29:46.780
MATT: Bare with this, new tech.

00:29:46.810 --> 00:29:49.840
New year, we're
making this work.

00:29:49.870 --> 00:29:51.780
LIAM: There, there.

00:29:51.810 --> 00:29:53.240
The egg that's there.

00:29:53.240 --> 00:29:55.240
TALIESIN: I have a brilliant solution
for this for next time.

00:29:55.240 --> 00:29:56.510
MATT: So, from there-- yeah.

00:29:56.540 --> 00:29:57.660
You wouldn't be
able to make it there.

00:29:57.660 --> 00:29:58.570
LIAM: Literally, in game.

00:29:58.600 --> 00:29:59.750
SAM: Invert controls.

00:29:59.780 --> 00:30:00.780
TRAVIS: It's like a jet fighter.

00:30:00.810 --> 00:30:02.660
-MARISHA: Battleship.
-TALIESIN: We can Battleship it.

00:30:02.690 --> 00:30:04.510
Next time, next time, we'll
just have a row of letters

00:30:04.540 --> 00:30:05.690
and a row of numbers.

00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:08.600
-Says move me up to L7.
-LAURA: I can't use inverted controls.

00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:10.190
SAM: I only use inverted.

00:30:10.190 --> 00:30:12.630
LAURA: Really?

00:30:12.660 --> 00:30:13.840
TALIESIN: Isn't that a great idea?

00:30:13.870 --> 00:30:15.120
MATT: Destroyed.

00:30:15.150 --> 00:30:17.270
TALIESIN: That was amazing.

00:30:19.060 --> 00:30:23.450
MATT: This egg has one
crack in the side there.

00:30:24.810 --> 00:30:26.390
Okay.

00:30:26.420 --> 00:30:28.240
LAURA: Did you just mark
on your cool eggs?

00:30:28.270 --> 00:30:29.760
TRAVIS: He's using dry erase.

00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:31.570
MATT: Wet erase and, you know. It's fun.

00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:33.480
TALIESIN: It's either that
or lick them.

00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:35.460
SAM: How many more times are we
gonna play

00:30:35.460 --> 00:30:37.360
with dragon eggs in a year?

00:30:38.450 --> 00:30:40.270
TRAVIS: Did you have us on
tiny plastic eggs?

00:30:40.270 --> 00:30:42.720
MATT: Yeah, so I ordered
way too many.

00:30:42.750 --> 00:30:44.680
I put a bunch in my cart
to make sure that I--

00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:46.130
I didn't know
which one to get

00:30:46.130 --> 00:30:47.600
and then forgot about it,
came back and was like,

00:30:47.630 --> 00:30:49.090
"Oh shit, I got
to order that."

00:30:49.120 --> 00:30:51.740
Ended up buying
like three bags full.

00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:54.510
TALIESIN: What am I gonna do
with all these eggs?

00:30:54.540 --> 00:30:57.180
MATT: We'll have egg
plastic giveaways.

00:30:57.210 --> 00:30:58.780
That ends
your turn, Vax?

00:30:58.810 --> 00:31:01.300
Alright.

00:31:01.330 --> 00:31:03.210
At the end of
your turn, Vax,

00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:06.670
you feel the effect of
the haste potion dissipate

00:31:06.670 --> 00:31:09.570
and your body, all of a sudden,
goes from this hyperactive,

00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:12.570
very familiar mode
to extremely lethargic

00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:15.770
and you find yourself having
to fight to catch your breath.

00:31:16.870 --> 00:31:19.330
So, you can't take
any actions next turn.

00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:21.920
-Can't do anything.
-LAURA: Oh, it's the potion.

00:31:21.920 --> 00:31:23.660
MATT: It's the potion,
it's not the boots.

00:31:23.690 --> 00:31:25.780
LIAM: The boots, right.

00:31:25.810 --> 00:31:28.240
MATT: Kima is trying to keep
up pace with you, Grog.

00:31:28.270 --> 00:31:30.570
You're still in
your large form.

00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:33.060
How long's that last for?

00:31:33.090 --> 00:31:34.930
TRAVIS: Let me check.

00:31:34.930 --> 00:31:36.330
Enlarge: 10 minutes.

00:31:36.330 --> 00:31:38.710
MATT: Yeah, alright, so you're
like bounding through.

00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:40.210
Kima's falling behind.

00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:42.750
As you guys both enter,
and continue past

00:31:42.780 --> 00:31:44.780
you hear the explosions in the
distance and all of a sudden,

00:31:44.810 --> 00:31:48.180
the rolling of smoke
and ash rushes past you.

00:31:50.010 --> 00:31:51.380
The smell
doesn't bother you

00:31:51.380 --> 00:31:53.540
cause you've had the smell
of burning beard hair

00:31:53.570 --> 00:31:55.390
most of this
close to your nose.

00:31:55.420 --> 00:31:56.660
What was once your
great bush beard

00:31:56.690 --> 00:31:58.410
is a little tighter
to your face now.

00:31:58.410 --> 00:31:59.480
TRAVIS: What?

00:31:59.480 --> 00:32:01.600
You've taken a few dragon fire breaths

00:32:01.630 --> 00:32:03.090
to the face.

00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:04.360
The fact that
you have any hair

00:32:04.390 --> 00:32:07.120
is by the grace of your
ancestral history.

00:32:07.150 --> 00:32:08.510
That Dwarven
belt you have.

00:32:08.540 --> 00:32:11.560
TRAVIS: I know, that's why it's so precious.

00:32:11.560 --> 00:32:13.960
MATT: But are you just going full sprint

00:32:13.960 --> 00:32:15.390
to catch up
with everybody?

00:32:15.390 --> 00:32:16.840
-TRAVIS: Yeah.
-MATT: Alright.

00:32:16.870 --> 00:32:17.990
TRAVIS: I'll just roll it.

00:32:17.990 --> 00:32:20.000
I still have
Pike with me, right?

00:32:20.030 --> 00:32:21.330
MATT: Pike is coming
with you, yeah.

00:32:21.360 --> 00:32:22.450
'Cause you picked her up.

00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:24.540
so you're just
running with Pike.

00:32:24.570 --> 00:32:27.690
Kima's just
like, "Damn it!"

00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:30.030
Left in the ash.

00:32:30.060 --> 00:32:32.480
You, while you were behind,
you, with your full speed,

00:32:32.510 --> 00:32:34.600
being faster than everybody
else in this group,

00:32:34.630 --> 00:32:37.030
you almost catch up entirely
to Percy and Gilmore

00:32:37.060 --> 00:32:40.060
and pretty much on their
initiative count going forward,

00:32:40.090 --> 00:32:43.150
or at least of the arrival
count in the next round.

00:32:43.180 --> 00:32:45.600
That finishes your go.

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:49.180
Let's see.

00:32:49.210 --> 00:32:53.150
♪

00:32:53.180 --> 00:32:54.720
You were after Vax, right?

00:32:54.750 --> 00:32:57.570
TRAVIS: Yes, no, no, I was
right before Vax.

00:32:57.600 --> 00:33:01.060
MATT: Right, so I got a little out
of order, sorry, my apologies.

00:33:01.090 --> 00:33:04.120
Alright, so anyway, it wouldn't
have made a difference.

00:33:04.150 --> 00:33:06.720
So Kima goes for a run. Pike.

00:33:06.750 --> 00:33:08.870
Is Pike doing
anything on your back?

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:10.570
LAURA: Yes.

00:33:10.600 --> 00:33:12.720
Pike's gonna heal you.

00:33:12.750 --> 00:33:13.840
-TRAVIS: Who?
-LAURA: You.

00:33:13.870 --> 00:33:15.780
-TRAVIS: Me?
-SAM: Ran away.

00:33:15.810 --> 00:33:17.780
-LAURA: Yeah, she's--
-LIAM: Oh, wait, she's with him.

00:33:17.780 --> 00:33:19.360
-LAURA: Yeah.
-MATT: He's carrying her.

00:33:19.390 --> 00:33:20.540
LIAM: Nice.

00:33:20.570 --> 00:33:22.060
TRAVIS: I got a little backpack.

00:33:22.060 --> 00:33:23.120
MARISHA: I was just gonna say,
is she Yoda-ing you?

00:33:23.150 --> 00:33:24.360
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:33:24.390 --> 00:33:26.020
MARISHA: Is it like a Yoda
situation, that's awesome.

00:33:26.020 --> 00:33:27.270
TRAVIS: The force.

00:33:27.300 --> 00:33:28.630
That was terrible.

00:33:28.660 --> 00:33:31.180
MATT: That was pretty
awful, actually.

00:33:31.210 --> 00:33:33.540
(talking over each other)

00:33:36.870 --> 00:33:39.420
SAM: Hi, I'm Yoda.

00:33:40.600 --> 00:33:42.720
TRAVIS: I think that's
his brother, Carl.

00:33:42.750 --> 00:33:46.390
LAURA: She's gonna cast Cure Wounds
at third level on him.

00:33:46.420 --> 00:33:48.620
TALIESIN: That Seagulls
song is so great.

00:33:48.620 --> 00:33:50.380
LAURA: So, that's three d8's.

00:33:50.380 --> 00:33:52.430
MARISHA: One of the best things
they've done in a while.

00:33:52.430 --> 00:33:54.720
TALIESIN: One of the best things
they've done in a long while.

00:33:54.720 --> 00:33:56.780
LAURA: Ooh, that's pretty good.

00:33:56.810 --> 00:34:00.660
Sixteen plus her page, her modifier.

00:34:02.330 --> 00:34:04.630
What is-- oh, that's--

00:34:04.660 --> 00:34:06.390
TRAVIS: Wisdom?

00:34:06.420 --> 00:34:08.840
LAURA: That's my page.

00:34:08.840 --> 00:34:10.000
LIAM: Clerics are--

00:34:10.030 --> 00:34:11.510
MATT: Wisdom, wisdom.

00:34:11.540 --> 00:34:13.780
Five, so add five to that.

00:34:13.810 --> 00:34:15.719
LAURA: Plus five, 18.

00:34:15.750 --> 00:34:17.540
-Twenty-one.
-MATT: There you go.

00:34:17.570 --> 00:34:19.000
TRAVIS: Thanks, Pike.

00:34:19.030 --> 00:34:21.810
LAURA: "Oh, you're
welcome, Grog."

00:34:21.840 --> 00:34:25.239
-LIAM: You know.
-LAURA: Well, you know.

00:34:25.270 --> 00:34:26.750
MATT: Scanlan.

00:34:26.780 --> 00:34:29.580
SAM: I will run...

00:34:31.060 --> 00:34:33.719
my 25 feet,

00:34:33.750 --> 00:34:37.719
and then pop a potion.

00:34:41.510 --> 00:34:44.600
Just a normal potion of healing
'cause that's all I got.

00:34:44.630 --> 00:34:47.210
MATT: So, that's a 1d--
2d4 plus two.

00:34:47.239 --> 00:34:48.260
SAM: Okay.

00:34:50.389 --> 00:34:52.210
Ooh.

00:34:52.239 --> 00:34:53.449
2d4 plus two?

00:34:53.480 --> 00:34:55.420
MATT: Yep.

00:34:55.449 --> 00:34:56.780
SAM: Five.

00:34:56.810 --> 00:34:58.240
MATT: You heal
five hit points.

00:34:58.270 --> 00:34:59.570
SAM: Great, I'm up to 70.

00:34:59.570 --> 00:35:01.980
MATT: Are you-- are you doing
anything else on your turn?

00:35:01.980 --> 00:35:03.210
Are you dashing?

00:35:03.240 --> 00:35:04.920
SAM: Can I use my action to dash?

00:35:04.920 --> 00:35:07.060
MATT: Yes, your action to
move again, essentially.

00:35:07.090 --> 00:35:08.270
SAM: Okay.

00:35:08.300 --> 00:35:10.000
I will do such a thing
cause I don't even know.

00:35:10.030 --> 00:35:11.540
I'm just following
people and--

00:35:11.570 --> 00:35:14.330
MATT: Yeah, you're a little bit behind
and you're pretty much--

00:35:14.360 --> 00:35:15.810
Grog has caught up to you,

00:35:15.840 --> 00:35:18.910
and you guys are just behind
Gilmore and Percy at this point.

00:35:18.910 --> 00:35:20.870
SAM: Okay, I'm in
front of Grog still?

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:22.780
-MATT: Yeah.
-TRAVIS: Damn.

00:35:22.810 --> 00:35:24.030
(laughing)

00:35:24.060 --> 00:35:25.680
MATT: Well, he was
running while you--

00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:28.360
(breathing heavily)

00:35:28.390 --> 00:35:31.770
SAM: Objects in the mirror
are gigantic.

00:35:32.750 --> 00:35:35.120
MATT: Okay, at the end
of your turn--

00:35:39.090 --> 00:35:40.300
SAM: I die.

00:35:40.330 --> 00:35:46.660
♪

00:35:46.690 --> 00:35:48.630
MATT: Vax.

00:35:48.660 --> 00:35:51.240
You, as you fly over with
your wings in the air,

00:35:51.270 --> 00:35:52.690
looking down at the egg.

00:35:52.720 --> 00:35:56.390
You feel this sudden
warm wind pass through you.

00:35:56.420 --> 00:35:58.180
LAURA: What is that?

00:35:58.210 --> 00:35:59.420
MARISHA: Fuck, is that her?

00:35:59.450 --> 00:36:01.090
MATT: You don't quite--
it seems sourceless,

00:36:01.120 --> 00:36:03.930
but it just seems to
fill you and leave.

00:36:04.660 --> 00:36:06.600
LAURA: Does it feel good when it
happens or does it feel like--

00:36:06.630 --> 00:36:08.210
MATT: It's just different.

00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:10.150
It's already a hot, like
you're all sweating in here,

00:36:10.180 --> 00:36:11.510
so the fact that
you feel something,

00:36:11.540 --> 00:36:13.720
like, warm briefly comparatively
to the temperature around you

00:36:13.750 --> 00:36:14.810
is what catches
your attention.

00:36:14.840 --> 00:36:15.810
It doesn't hurt
or damage you,

00:36:15.840 --> 00:36:17.630
but it just
seems strange.

00:36:17.660 --> 00:36:19.300
TALIESIN: I don't like any of this.

00:36:19.300 --> 00:36:20.840
MARISHA: I don't like any of it.

00:36:20.840 --> 00:36:22.110
SAM: It's menopause.

00:36:23.450 --> 00:36:24.690
LAURA: It's natural.

00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:29.210
LIAM: You ruined the surprise.

00:36:29.240 --> 00:36:31.390
TRAVIS: I cast Menopause on you.

00:36:31.420 --> 00:36:34.000

I suffer it myself.

00:36:34.030 --> 00:36:36.450

-TRAVIS: You bastard.

00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:38.360
MATT: Percival, we're up at the
top of the initiative.

00:36:38.390 --> 00:36:40.330
TALIESIN: I'm running my
way in there.

00:36:40.360 --> 00:36:42.390
MATT: Alright.

00:36:42.420 --> 00:36:46.570
So...

00:36:46.600 --> 00:36:48.240
Alrighty.

00:36:48.270 --> 00:36:50.660
Percival, at a full run.

00:36:50.690 --> 00:36:52.510
If you go full run,
you'll manage to get

00:36:52.540 --> 00:36:55.120
just barely inside
the cavern about there.

00:36:55.150 --> 00:36:56.120
TALIESIN: Okay.

00:36:56.150 --> 00:36:57.840
MATT: Right there.

00:36:57.870 --> 00:37:00.150
-TALIESIN: That'll do.
-MATT: So, that'll be your turn.

00:37:00.180 --> 00:37:02.210
There's still a bonus action
if you have any use for it, so.

00:37:02.240 --> 00:37:04.180
TALIESIN: I don't really have--

00:37:04.210 --> 00:37:05.780
Mostly I just want to
use my bonus action

00:37:05.810 --> 00:37:08.060
to take in everything and
look around and have a--

00:37:08.090 --> 00:37:09.780
have a good, good
serious look.

00:37:09.810 --> 00:37:11.720
In fact, I'll even
take a perception roll

00:37:11.720 --> 00:37:12.940
if I can have one.

00:37:12.940 --> 00:37:14.420
-MATT: Go for it.
-TALIESIN: Okay.

00:37:14.450 --> 00:37:17.450
SAM: Just a good
sit and think.

00:37:17.480 --> 00:37:18.720
TALIESIN: Let's get-- okay,
no never mind.

00:37:18.750 --> 00:37:20.810
That's pretty good.

00:37:20.840 --> 00:37:24.540
Wow, it has been a while.

00:37:24.570 --> 00:37:26.060
-Twenty-five.
-MATT: Twenty-five.

00:37:26.090 --> 00:37:29.450
Glancing around,
you see a fire elemental

00:37:29.480 --> 00:37:31.120
that briefly startles you

00:37:31.150 --> 00:37:32.360
as you kind of whip
around in that direction,

00:37:32.390 --> 00:37:33.810
but you recognize--

00:37:33.840 --> 00:37:35.600
MARISHA: And like, it's got
antlers, and I'm like...

00:37:35.630 --> 00:37:37.120
(grunts)

00:37:37.150 --> 00:37:38.390
TALIESIN: I love Hannibal
too, it's great.

00:37:38.420 --> 00:37:42.540
Okay.

00:37:42.570 --> 00:37:44.540
Eggs, dust.

00:37:44.570 --> 00:37:45.600
MATT: Yeah, you see eggs.

00:37:45.630 --> 00:37:47.330
One is destroyed
and just leaking out

00:37:47.360 --> 00:37:48.780
and like a series
of boulders

00:37:48.810 --> 00:37:51.420
and what looks like
some sort of a large,

00:37:51.450 --> 00:37:54.510
concave impression on the top.

00:37:54.540 --> 00:37:56.420
There are eggs scattered
throughout the area.

00:37:56.450 --> 00:37:58.120
There's a giant
storm cloud gathering

00:37:58.150 --> 00:38:00.090
in the roof of the cavern,

00:38:00.120 --> 00:38:01.720
and there is the
large pool of lava

00:38:01.750 --> 00:38:03.240
with the small
pool over there.

00:38:03.270 --> 00:38:04.480
You see occasional glimmers

00:38:04.510 --> 00:38:07.180
of what look like
coin in the distance.

00:38:07.210 --> 00:38:09.180
TALIESIN: Can you put me,
like, on the wall

00:38:09.210 --> 00:38:10.540
just cause I don't
think I'd be--

00:38:10.570 --> 00:38:13.120
I was still spider crawling
so even

00:38:13.150 --> 00:38:14.540
on top of the little
wall thing, if you want.

00:38:14.540 --> 00:38:15.840
MATT: Sure, I'll
put you there.

00:38:15.870 --> 00:38:17.030
Sure, why not, Percy?

00:38:17.060 --> 00:38:18.090
-TALIESIN: Thank you.
-MATT: You're welcome.

00:38:18.120 --> 00:38:19.420
TALIESIN: That makes me happy.

00:38:19.450 --> 00:38:22.060
LIAM: How high is it to these
holes in the ceiling from--

00:38:22.090 --> 00:38:25.330
MATT: I'd say it's
about 60, 70 feet up?

00:38:25.360 --> 00:38:29.270
-LAURA: Okay.
-TALIESIN: Cool, cool.

00:38:29.300 --> 00:38:33.600
MATT: Yeah, the whole cavern's
kind of domed like this.

00:38:33.630 --> 00:38:35.780
Alrighty, then,
that's Percy's turn.

00:38:35.810 --> 00:38:38.030
Another lair action's
going to transpire.

00:38:38.060 --> 00:38:40.270
SAM: Oh.

00:38:40.300 --> 00:38:41.330
This one's a good one.

00:38:41.360 --> 00:38:42.480
This one heals everybody.

00:38:42.510 --> 00:38:44.330
MATT: Yeah.

00:38:44.360 --> 00:38:47.420
There is a fissure
that erupts

00:38:47.450 --> 00:38:49.660
over in this
side of the room.

00:38:49.690 --> 00:38:53.000
The ground kind of
cracks open and this--

00:38:53.030 --> 00:38:55.150
You've seen
it happen once.

00:38:55.180 --> 00:38:59.840
A plume of poisonous gas
fills this space here.

00:38:59.870 --> 00:39:03.090
LAURA: It's okay, we're
immune to poison.

00:39:03.120 --> 00:39:04.360
MATT: Let's see.

00:39:04.390 --> 00:39:06.660
I need-- I need you, Vex,

00:39:06.690 --> 00:39:08.840
to make a constitution
saving throw.

00:39:08.870 --> 00:39:11.630
LAURA: Even I'm immune to poison?

00:39:11.660 --> 00:39:13.480
Oh, no.

00:39:13.510 --> 00:39:14.480
MARISHA: Really?

00:39:14.510 --> 00:39:15.510
Even with Hero's Feast?

00:39:15.540 --> 00:39:17.540
-SAM: Oh, no.
-MARISHA: Oh, shit.

00:39:23.210 --> 00:39:24.870
LAURA: I got plus two
for the ring.

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:26.240
So, 11.

00:39:26.270 --> 00:39:27.360
SAM: Eleven.

00:39:27.390 --> 00:39:28.540
MATT: Okay, good, I'll
keep that in mind.

00:39:28.570 --> 00:39:30.300
TALIESIN: That's a number.

00:39:30.330 --> 00:39:31.750
MATT: Okay.

00:39:31.780 --> 00:39:33.750
It is now...

00:39:33.780 --> 00:39:35.360
TRAVIS: What does that mean?

00:39:35.390 --> 00:39:37.120
What does it mean?

00:39:37.150 --> 00:39:39.360
LAURA: Slowly my skin starts
to melt off my body.

00:39:39.390 --> 00:39:42.420
MATT: Yeah, you just-- the cloud
kind of fills the area

00:39:42.450 --> 00:39:44.330
and you start
coughing, that's it.

00:39:44.360 --> 00:39:47.840
It hasn't gone your turn yet,
so, it is now Raishan's turn.

00:39:47.870 --> 00:39:50.870
Legendary actions
are restored.

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:53.600
TALIESIN: I hate all of this.

00:39:53.630 --> 00:39:55.600
Oh, good, I was worried
about her legendary actions.

00:39:55.630 --> 00:39:58.180
♪

00:39:58.210 --> 00:40:00.450
MARISHA: Are you being facetious?

00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:02.880
TALIESIN: I don't know
what that means.

00:40:04.030 --> 00:40:05.330
LAURA: Who's turn is
it right now?

00:40:05.360 --> 00:40:07.030
-It's Raishan's?
-MATT: It's Raishan's turn.

00:40:07.060 --> 00:40:08.720
Deciding what to do.

00:40:11.720 --> 00:40:12.840
Okay.

00:40:12.870 --> 00:40:14.360
TALIESIN: I don't know the
meaning of the word.

00:40:20.030 --> 00:40:21.690
MATT: Um...

00:40:21.720 --> 00:40:23.270
SAM: This is fun.

00:40:23.300 --> 00:40:25.330
Just good, clean fun.

00:40:26.420 --> 00:40:27.810
MATT: Percival.

00:40:27.840 --> 00:40:29.750
SAM: Oh.

00:40:29.780 --> 00:40:31.180
MATT: As you're running
along the wall,

00:40:31.210 --> 00:40:32.600
and you glance in the vicinity,

00:40:32.630 --> 00:40:35.090
you see the cloud of poison
kind of burst from the ground

00:40:35.120 --> 00:40:37.270
and you're just
out of the range of it.

00:40:40.110 --> 00:40:42.370
I'm sorry, it's just within
your range from where the--

00:40:42.370 --> 00:40:44.120
TALIESIN: I'm wearing my mask.

00:40:44.120 --> 00:40:45.660
MATT: Yeah, you have
your mask on.

00:40:45.660 --> 00:40:48.150
TALIESIN: I don't know if it actually
helps, but there we are.

00:40:48.150 --> 00:40:49.950
TRAVIS: You look fabulous.

00:40:49.950 --> 00:40:53.270
MATT:So, as you're standing
kind of amongst this--

00:40:53.300 --> 00:40:56.720
this fume, you see this
within this, this cloud,

00:40:56.750 --> 00:41:00.120
a kind of strange burst of very,
very faint light in your area

00:41:00.150 --> 00:41:02.270
and you feel, even
in this heated room,

00:41:02.300 --> 00:41:04.780
a sudden surge of heat within
your kind of torso region

00:41:04.810 --> 00:41:06.150
and then it fades.

00:41:06.180 --> 00:41:08.030
LAURA: What does it mean?!

00:41:08.060 --> 00:41:10.090
It's freaking me
the fuck out.

00:41:10.120 --> 00:41:12.740
TRAVIS: She's blazing us, ya'll.
She's lighting us up.

00:41:12.740 --> 00:41:14.380
LAURA: What if it's like--

00:41:14.380 --> 00:41:16.030
TRAVIS: Doesn't Hunter's Mark feel
like something sometimes?

00:41:16.060 --> 00:41:17.570
LAURA: Oh my God,
that's right.

00:41:17.570 --> 00:41:19.770
What if she's like marking
us for death or something?

00:41:19.770 --> 00:41:22.760
MATT: You now can faintly
hear what sounds like...

00:41:24.390 --> 00:41:26.480
There are footsteps moving
through the tunnels,

00:41:26.510 --> 00:41:28.840
but you're unable
in the current chaos

00:41:28.870 --> 00:41:31.090
and the obscured vision
to see where it's happening

00:41:31.120 --> 00:41:33.210
but there is movement happening
above you throughout the cavern.

00:41:33.240 --> 00:41:34.660
TALIESIN: My save versus magic

00:41:34.690 --> 00:41:36.330
would not help
with this at all.

00:41:36.360 --> 00:41:38.360
Cabal's Ruin would
not help with this.

00:41:38.360 --> 00:41:39.600
Okay, just check.

00:41:42.030 --> 00:41:44.000
MATT: Okay.

00:41:44.030 --> 00:41:47.150
That ends Raishan's turn.

00:41:47.180 --> 00:41:50.870
That's gonna bring
us to Keyleth.

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:53.390
MARISHA: Okay.

00:41:53.420 --> 00:41:58.150
Really unsure of what's going
on, so I'm just going to...

00:41:58.180 --> 00:42:00.180
TRAVIS: Laser pointer right here.

00:42:00.210 --> 00:42:01.240
LAURA: Laser pointer.

00:42:01.270 --> 00:42:02.810
MARISHA: Thank you.

00:42:02.840 --> 00:42:07.270
I'm gonna go to that egg right
here that Vax was wailing on.

00:42:07.300 --> 00:42:09.510
-MATT: Yep.
-MARISHA: And try and finish it off.

00:42:09.540 --> 00:42:11.540
MATT: Okay, you move up and as
you get to the edge of it,

00:42:11.570 --> 00:42:14.120
you can see now the light
that your body's giving off.

00:42:14.150 --> 00:42:15.780
So, the fire elemental
is glinting off of piles

00:42:15.810 --> 00:42:18.840
of gold and platinum that are
kind of gathered around the egg.

00:42:18.870 --> 00:42:21.750
About a third of it is
still submerged in volcanic rock

00:42:21.780 --> 00:42:23.630
and has been placed
here for quite some time.

00:42:23.660 --> 00:42:26.060
LAURA: Don't let me die,
I need to loot.

00:42:26.090 --> 00:42:28.810
MATT: You can see the crack in
the exterior of the egg

00:42:28.840 --> 00:42:31.570
and the kind of thick
purplish amniotic fluid

00:42:31.600 --> 00:42:33.000
that is slowly dribbling
down like a--

00:42:33.030 --> 00:42:34.240
like a slow moving molasses

00:42:34.270 --> 00:42:38.300
or sap from the wound
left behind by Vax.

00:42:38.330 --> 00:42:40.150
MARISHA: I'm gonna do
two slam attacks.

00:42:40.180 --> 00:42:44.870
-MATT: Go for it.
-MARISHA: Multi attack.

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:47.450
Uh, wait.

00:42:50.600 --> 00:42:53.090
Those were
both nine's.

00:42:53.120 --> 00:42:55.570
Which is--
so 15 total.

00:42:55.600 --> 00:42:57.210
-To hit?
-MATT: Fifteen to hit?

00:42:57.240 --> 00:42:58.360
It does hit, yes.

00:42:58.390 --> 00:43:01.030
MARISHA: Okay, and that is--

00:43:01.060 --> 00:43:03.180
MATT: Only because he pre-damaged
it to that point.

00:43:03.210 --> 00:43:07.480
You're basically attacking
through the shell of the egg.

00:43:07.510 --> 00:43:09.630
Removed a portion of
its armor, so otherwise--

00:43:09.660 --> 00:43:11.090
TALIESIN: You're punching a
dragon fetus right now.

00:43:11.120 --> 00:43:12.210
MARISHA: I am totally
punching a dragon--

00:43:12.240 --> 00:43:16.600
TALIESIN: That's like
so eggs benedict.

00:43:16.630 --> 00:43:20.330
MARISHA: Plus six,
so that's a ten.

00:43:20.360 --> 00:43:22.750
Fourteen,
eighteen damage.

00:43:22.780 --> 00:43:24.720
MATT: Okay.

00:43:24.750 --> 00:43:27.270
So, you plunge your
flaming fist into the fluid.

00:43:27.300 --> 00:43:30.360
You hear it immediately sizzle
as your fist goes into it.

00:43:30.390 --> 00:43:33.150
You punch something
dense on the inside.

00:43:33.180 --> 00:43:34.600
(groaning)

00:43:34.630 --> 00:43:36.690
LAURA: Oh, you punched
a baby dragon.

00:43:36.720 --> 00:43:38.270
LIAM: Good.

00:43:38.300 --> 00:43:40.750
LAURA: "Good."

00:43:40.780 --> 00:43:42.690
-MARISHA: Okay, that's my turn.
-LAURA: In the head.

00:43:42.720 --> 00:43:43.750
MATT: You did both of
those slam attacks?

00:43:43.780 --> 00:43:46.630
MARISHA: Those were both--
those my attacks.

00:43:46.660 --> 00:43:48.030
MATT: You rolled a 15 and a--

00:43:48.060 --> 00:43:51.570
MARISHA: I rolled two nine's
and I have a plus six.

00:43:51.600 --> 00:43:53.600
-MATT: Oh!
-MARISHA: I rolled both of 'em twice.

00:43:53.630 --> 00:43:55.000
MATT: Oh, oh, so you
rolled 15 both times.

00:43:55.030 --> 00:43:56.060
-MARISHA: Yes.
-MATT: Got you.

00:43:56.090 --> 00:43:57.180
Then how much damage
did you total?

00:43:57.210 --> 00:43:58.540
-MARISHA: Eighteen.
-MATT: Eighteen from both attacks?

00:43:58.570 --> 00:44:00.510
-MARISHA: Yes.
-MATT: Okay, cool.

00:44:00.540 --> 00:44:02.750
Alright, so,
with both slams,

00:44:02.780 --> 00:44:05.780
the first fist goes in and
slams and hits something.

00:44:05.810 --> 00:44:07.450
The second time you
reach in and slamming,

00:44:07.480 --> 00:44:09.090
you grab it and pull out,

00:44:09.120 --> 00:44:11.000
as you kind of yank out of
the egg just a little bit,

00:44:11.030 --> 00:44:15.870
you see what looks
like the snout of a very

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:19.420
tiny Thordak essentially.

00:44:19.450 --> 00:44:21.630
But whereas the red dragon
you saw Thordak,

00:44:21.660 --> 00:44:24.120
that was like
partially volcanic,

00:44:24.150 --> 00:44:26.450
crystalline with
the burning eyes,

00:44:26.480 --> 00:44:28.810
this creature
is seemingly made

00:44:28.840 --> 00:44:33.600
from pure primordial
fire and rock.

00:44:33.630 --> 00:44:38.300
This is a whole
new form of dragon.

00:44:38.330 --> 00:44:39.510
MARISHA: He made them clones.

00:44:39.540 --> 00:44:40.870
LAURA: What if he made--
what if it's one

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:43.210
for every member
of the Conclave?

00:44:43.240 --> 00:44:44.360
MARISHA: How many are there?

00:44:44.390 --> 00:44:46.030
LAURA: There's five eggs,
but one is crushed

00:44:46.060 --> 00:44:49.210
and that would be Raishan and
there would be nothing in it.

00:44:49.240 --> 00:44:50.540
SAM: What?

00:44:50.570 --> 00:44:52.120
MARISHA: Wait, are we sure
there was nothing in it?

00:44:52.150 --> 00:44:53.480
LAURA: I don't know.

00:44:53.510 --> 00:44:55.030
MARISHA: Do you want to go check and see
if there was something in it?

00:44:55.060 --> 00:44:56.390
TRAVIS: Covered in rock,
we can't see.

00:44:56.420 --> 00:44:57.780
MARISHA: Are there five--
there are five eggs?

00:44:57.810 --> 00:44:59.210
SAM: Or he was making their
own basketball team.

00:44:59.240 --> 00:45:01.020
MATT: There are five eggs
that you can see currently.

00:45:01.020 --> 00:45:02.780
LIAM: And they're all red,
they're all red.

00:45:02.810 --> 00:45:03.810
MATT: They're all red, yes.

00:45:03.840 --> 00:45:04.860
LAURA: Okay, well,
they're all red.

00:45:04.930 --> 00:45:06.030
Maybe they're
all Thordak's.

00:45:06.060 --> 00:45:07.810
MARISHA: They're little clones?

00:45:07.840 --> 00:45:09.060
TALIESIN: If they're clones, maybe it's

00:45:09.090 --> 00:45:11.120
literally five new
breeds of dragon.

00:45:11.150 --> 00:45:12.120
LAURA: Oh my God.

00:45:12.150 --> 00:45:13.300
TRAVIS: Only one way
to find out.

00:45:13.330 --> 00:45:14.630
MARISHA: Yeah, only one
way to find out.

00:45:14.660 --> 00:45:16.570
-Let's bust open another one.
-LAURA: Is it still alive?

00:45:16.600 --> 00:45:17.630
TALIESIN: What do you call the
little chocolate eggs?

00:45:17.660 --> 00:45:18.780
LAURA: Is it alive?

00:45:18.810 --> 00:45:20.660
MARISHA: Is it alive or did
I kind of kill it by--

00:45:20.690 --> 00:45:22.360
MATT: You kind of killed it.

00:45:22.390 --> 00:45:24.390
It's currently
limp in your grasp.

00:45:24.420 --> 00:45:25.450
SAM: Hey, you killed a dragon.

00:45:25.480 --> 00:45:26.450
LAURA: Good job.

00:45:26.480 --> 00:45:28.720
MARISHA: "I did it!

00:45:28.750 --> 00:45:30.080
I got one!"

00:45:30.100 --> 00:45:31.960
MATT: Keyleth, the
dragon snapper.

00:45:31.960 --> 00:45:35.390
TALIESIN: This is the like the Westworld
version of killing a dragon.

00:45:35.420 --> 00:45:37.340
SAM: How do you want to do this?

00:45:37.340 --> 00:45:38.450
Sunny side up.

00:45:38.450 --> 00:45:40.090
(laughing)

00:45:40.090 --> 00:45:41.420
TALIESIN: Benedict.

00:45:41.450 --> 00:45:43.420
MATT: Perfect.

00:45:43.450 --> 00:45:44.540
You still have
some movement, Keyleth,

00:45:44.570 --> 00:45:47.000
if you want
to move still.

00:45:47.030 --> 00:45:48.570
MARISHA: I do, don't I.

00:45:48.600 --> 00:45:53.360
I want to start
heading towards Vax.

00:45:53.390 --> 00:45:55.720
MATT: Towards Vax
this way, okay.

00:45:56.630 --> 00:45:58.810
What's your movement
in fire elemental form?

00:45:58.840 --> 00:46:01.030
-MARISHA: Fifty feet.
-MATT: Fifty feet?

00:46:01.060 --> 00:46:05.100
You get about there, however,
unaffected by fire and--

00:46:05.100 --> 00:46:07.060
MARISHA: And I'm, like, hovering.

00:46:07.090 --> 00:46:08.630
MATT: You're comfortable in this.

00:46:08.660 --> 00:46:10.600
-MARISHA: It's like a spa.
-MATT: Kinda yeah.

00:46:10.630 --> 00:46:11.980
-It's tingly.
-MARISHA: It's like a hot spring.

00:46:11.980 --> 00:46:13.140
MATT: It's perfect.

00:46:13.140 --> 00:46:15.390
Alright, that
ends your turn.

00:46:15.420 --> 00:46:19.510
Gilmore, just at a full run
gets up to the side here,

00:46:19.540 --> 00:46:20.720
and is kind of flanking.

00:46:20.750 --> 00:46:22.690
He enters the space,
pushes up against the wall

00:46:22.720 --> 00:46:25.550
and just kind of
surveys the territory.

00:46:26.150 --> 00:46:29.510
He looks spooked but
also kind of in that,

00:46:29.510 --> 00:46:31.210
"Well, we're here"
type mentality.

00:46:31.240 --> 00:46:35.180
Looks about the room and
goes, "Everyone all right?

00:46:35.210 --> 00:46:37.240
Please tell me
everyone's all right."

00:46:37.270 --> 00:46:39.150
(coughing)

00:46:39.180 --> 00:46:40.390
(whimpering)

00:46:40.420 --> 00:46:42.120
"Great."

00:46:43.240 --> 00:46:45.330
That ends Gilmore's
turn as he just arrives.

00:46:45.360 --> 00:46:46.630
Grog.

00:46:46.660 --> 00:46:50.300
(roars)

00:46:50.330 --> 00:46:52.150
You just come sprinting in.

00:46:52.180 --> 00:46:54.570
TRAVIS: Can I smack Shaun's
ass as I go by?

00:46:54.600 --> 00:46:57.030
Going, "Come on, Shaun."

00:46:57.060 --> 00:47:00.750
-MATT: Sure.
-LIAM: Shaun breaks in half.

00:47:00.780 --> 00:47:04.660
MATT: You aren't stealthy,
and as you run by,

00:47:04.690 --> 00:47:08.540
Shaun sees you about
to swing and goes like,

00:47:08.570 --> 00:47:11.150
"Fine."

00:47:11.180 --> 00:47:12.540
Whack!

00:47:12.570 --> 00:47:14.480
Might have
dislocated his hip.

00:47:14.510 --> 00:47:15.480
He's like...

00:47:15.510 --> 00:47:18.000
(strained laugh)

00:47:18.030 --> 00:47:19.150
"I'll charge you later."

00:47:19.180 --> 00:47:20.870
LAURA: That's gonna be a bruise
on the ass for sure.

00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:22.810
MATT: You get about there
and you are--

00:47:22.840 --> 00:47:24.420
Pike is technically
on your space,

00:47:24.450 --> 00:47:26.240
kind of clutching
to your shoulders.

00:47:26.270 --> 00:47:28.210
We'll say back here.

00:47:28.240 --> 00:47:29.810
Little Yoda backpack.

00:47:29.810 --> 00:47:31.390
TRAVIS: Do I get any
additional movement

00:47:31.420 --> 00:47:32.810
or am I just here now?

00:47:32.840 --> 00:47:34.810
MATT: You are a little
bit behind everybody.

00:47:34.840 --> 00:47:37.540
You've just now caught up to
everybody, and that's--

00:47:37.570 --> 00:47:38.630
Just your full double run

00:47:38.660 --> 00:47:40.240
and you just arrived
at the edge of the map.

00:47:40.270 --> 00:47:41.750
TRAVIS: "I'm here.

00:47:41.780 --> 00:47:44.440
Let the piñatas begin."

00:47:44.440 --> 00:47:46.220
SAM: "Okay, what's a piñata?"

00:47:46.220 --> 00:47:48.660
TRAVIS: "I don't know, I thought
it was a celebration.

00:47:48.690 --> 00:47:51.420
-Is it not?"
-MARISHA: You should ask Sam.

00:47:51.450 --> 00:47:53.600
SAM: Hola, me llamo Sam Riegel.

00:47:53.630 --> 00:47:55.060
MARISHA: Yeah, there you go.

00:47:55.090 --> 00:47:58.270
TALIESIN: ¿Donde está la biblioteca?

00:47:58.300 --> 00:48:01.300
MATT: Alright, that'll
bring us to Vex's turn.

00:48:01.330 --> 00:48:03.120
LAURA: Oh, okay, alright.

00:48:03.150 --> 00:48:07.030
MATT: At the top of your turn,

00:48:07.060 --> 00:48:09.870
the poison has
filled your lungs

00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:14.660
and while you
suffer no damage,

00:48:14.690 --> 00:48:17.330
you are incapacitated.

00:48:17.360 --> 00:48:19.090
You are just in
a coughing fit,

00:48:19.120 --> 00:48:20.390
almost falling
off of your broom.

00:48:20.420 --> 00:48:21.720
Like sliding off
to the side and just...

00:48:21.750 --> 00:48:23.270
(coughing)

00:48:23.300 --> 00:48:24.540
And you just
can't do anything.

00:48:24.570 --> 00:48:26.240
-LAURA: I can't do anything?
-MATT: Nope.

00:48:26.270 --> 00:48:28.000
LAURA: It was a whole
fucking turn?

00:48:28.030 --> 00:48:29.300
-MATT: Yep.
-LAURA: Gone.

00:48:29.330 --> 00:48:33.510
MARISHA: So, both the
twins have no turns.

00:48:33.540 --> 00:48:34.780
LAURA: Okay.

00:48:34.810 --> 00:48:36.150
MATT: The poison has
completely filled you

00:48:36.180 --> 00:48:37.480
to the point
where you're seizing.

00:48:37.510 --> 00:48:38.600
You feel the muscles
tightening up, and--

00:48:38.630 --> 00:48:40.180
LAURA: It's not hurting me--

00:48:40.210 --> 00:48:41.690
MATT: It's not hurting you, but
you're unable to do anything.

00:48:41.720 --> 00:48:42.870
TRAVIS: Sulfurous gas.

00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:46.300
It wrecks your shit.

00:48:46.330 --> 00:48:47.840
LIAM: Welcome to Hot Pepper Gaming.

00:48:47.870 --> 00:48:49.240
LAURA: That's good,
because you know what?

00:48:49.270 --> 00:48:50.540
I didn't have
anything planned

00:48:50.570 --> 00:48:51.840
and it would have been a
cluster fuck like last time,

00:48:51.870 --> 00:48:53.450
so fuck it.

00:48:53.480 --> 00:48:55.540
MATT: Vax.

00:48:55.570 --> 00:48:57.330
You currently
are just kinda like...

00:48:57.360 --> 00:48:58.720
(gasping)

00:48:58.750 --> 00:49:01.690
Taking a breath, your vision
kind of blurs for a moment

00:49:01.720 --> 00:49:03.480
and you can see the double
vision trying to align.

00:49:03.510 --> 00:49:05.060
It comes in to focus

00:49:05.090 --> 00:49:06.450
and you see Keyleth's
fire elemental form

00:49:06.480 --> 00:49:07.810
kind of gliding across.

00:49:07.840 --> 00:49:09.720
You see the edge of your
sister currently shadowed

00:49:09.750 --> 00:49:12.420
against this cloud of toxic, sulfurous gas

00:49:12.420 --> 00:49:14.060
that is spewed up
from the ground.

00:49:14.090 --> 00:49:15.920
You can hear her
coughing in the distance.

00:49:15.920 --> 00:49:17.560
You see a bunch
of your allies

00:49:17.560 --> 00:49:19.600
now beginning
to just show up

00:49:19.600 --> 00:49:23.120
on the outside of the
room's kind of lit interior,

00:49:23.150 --> 00:49:24.360
and it takes you
the full round

00:49:24.390 --> 00:49:26.570
to kind of
catch your breath.

00:49:26.600 --> 00:49:28.060
LIAM: No movement either, yeah?

00:49:28.090 --> 00:49:29.120
MATT: Let me double
check actually.

00:49:29.150 --> 00:49:31.570
I'm pretty sure...

00:49:31.600 --> 00:49:32.840
Let me see here.

00:49:32.870 --> 00:49:38.780
♪

00:49:38.810 --> 00:49:43.150
Can't move or take actions
until next turn, so no.

00:49:43.180 --> 00:49:47.090
Alright, so that ends
the end of Vax's turn.

00:49:47.120 --> 00:49:50.240
Let's see, at the
end of your turn.

00:49:50.270 --> 00:49:52.810
There is going to be...

00:49:52.840 --> 00:49:54.240
LIAM: This is fucking--

00:49:54.270 --> 00:49:56.510
(indistinct whispering)

00:49:58.530 --> 00:50:00.250
SAM: Did I--did I get a turn?

00:50:00.250 --> 00:50:01.450
No, I did mine already.

00:50:01.450 --> 00:50:03.120
MATT: Yeah, we're gonna
get to yours.

00:50:03.150 --> 00:50:05.290
LIAM: I'm still in the same position
15 feet up that I was.

00:50:05.290 --> 00:50:07.150
MATT: You are, yes.

00:50:07.180 --> 00:50:09.730
Yeah, your wings
are just like...

00:50:10.870 --> 00:50:13.600
Grog, you see this
kind of faint glimmer

00:50:13.630 --> 00:50:16.240
of energy around you

00:50:16.240 --> 00:50:18.120
and you instinctually
kind of like...

00:50:18.150 --> 00:50:19.150
(grunts)

00:50:19.180 --> 00:50:20.240
(growls)

00:50:20.270 --> 00:50:21.330
But no temperature change.

00:50:21.360 --> 00:50:22.710
Nothing seems to happen.

00:50:22.710 --> 00:50:25.210
TRAVIS: Do I smell anything?

00:50:25.240 --> 00:50:28.450
MATT: You smell sweaty gnome on metal armor.

00:50:28.480 --> 00:50:30.300
-LAURA: "Sorry."
-TRAVIS: "Honestly, really?

00:50:30.330 --> 00:50:31.540
I mean, come on."

00:50:31.570 --> 00:50:34.750
LIAM: "I'm just a little
nervous is all."

00:50:34.780 --> 00:50:37.780
TRAVIS: "Did you eat mustard pretzels
before this, my god?"

00:50:37.810 --> 00:50:40.570
LIAM: "Maybe."

00:50:40.600 --> 00:50:44.150
LAURA: "You know how
they make me calm."

00:50:44.180 --> 00:50:45.550
TRAVIS: Calm?

00:50:48.330 --> 00:50:50.450
SAM: Double Ashley is
the best Ashley.

00:50:57.540 --> 00:51:00.630
MATT: Kima's running, desperately
trying to catch up.

00:51:03.060 --> 00:51:05.000
But she's not quite
in the battlefield yet.

00:51:05.030 --> 00:51:06.420
It's Pike's go.

00:51:06.450 --> 00:51:07.720
LIAM: Pike, Pike,
it's your turn.

00:51:07.750 --> 00:51:10.330
LAURA: Okay, okay.

00:51:10.360 --> 00:51:12.090
LIAM: Yeah, let's buff everybody.

00:51:12.120 --> 00:51:15.510
LAURA: Yeah, so she's gonna cast--
what she should do mass--

00:51:15.540 --> 00:51:16.780
MARISHA: Is there anything
that could help

00:51:16.810 --> 00:51:20.630
with the stuff that has
been magically cast on us?

00:51:20.660 --> 00:51:22.780
TALIESIN: We don't actually
know what's been done.

00:51:22.810 --> 00:51:25.510
LAURA: Oh, on everybody
and it's 30 feet.

00:51:25.540 --> 00:51:27.060
How far--

00:51:27.090 --> 00:51:28.330
Can she move up and get--

00:51:28.360 --> 00:51:31.060
How many people can
she get in a 30 foot cone?

00:51:31.090 --> 00:51:32.510
MATT: A 30 foot cone?

00:51:32.540 --> 00:51:34.390
LAURA: A 30 foot radius.

00:51:34.420 --> 00:51:36.630
MATT: From where she is,
it's six squares.

00:51:36.660 --> 00:51:37.750
LIAM: But she can
move forward.

00:51:37.780 --> 00:51:39.150
MATT: She can move 25 squares
right now.

00:51:39.180 --> 00:51:40.390
She's been
on Grog's back.

00:51:40.420 --> 00:51:42.120
She can kind of
like leap off and--

00:51:42.150 --> 00:51:45.210
LIAM: But she could get closer
to--to Vex, right?

00:51:45.240 --> 00:51:46.450
LAURA: Vex and Percy and Grog?

00:51:46.480 --> 00:51:47.660
LIAM: Yeah.

00:51:47.690 --> 00:51:49.150
MATT: She's right here,
she can move this way

00:51:49.180 --> 00:51:50.180
or this way or
wherever you want.

00:51:50.210 --> 00:51:51.600
LAURA: Let's-- okay.

00:51:51.630 --> 00:51:52.600
MARISHA: Here, guys.

00:51:52.630 --> 00:51:53.600
TRAVIS: Here's a pointer.

00:51:53.630 --> 00:51:56.480
MARISHA: Laser pointer.

00:51:56.510 --> 00:51:58.390
LIAM: If she gets near Vex,

00:51:58.420 --> 00:52:02.120
then she can get Grog,
Gilmore, Percy.

00:52:02.150 --> 00:52:03.450
LAURA: Maybe like in that area?

00:52:03.480 --> 00:52:04.780
-LIAM: Yeah, yeah.
-LAURA: Or like, no.

00:52:04.810 --> 00:52:06.510
-LIAM: Closer to Percy.
-LAURA: Yeah!

00:52:06.540 --> 00:52:08.780
MATT: This-- she'll just be on the
outskirts of getting Percy

00:52:08.810 --> 00:52:10.000
and can get all
the rest of you guys.

00:52:10.030 --> 00:52:11.060
LIAM: Keyleth as well?

00:52:11.090 --> 00:52:12.420
TALIESIN: She doesn't
really need it.

00:52:12.450 --> 00:52:13.480
LIAM: Why not?

00:52:13.510 --> 00:52:14.480
MATT: She can just
catch Keyleth.

00:52:14.510 --> 00:52:15.660
LAURA: Yeah, sweet,
that's great.

00:52:15.690 --> 00:52:17.210
Then she casts Beacon
of Hope from there.

00:52:17.240 --> 00:52:18.240
MATT: Okay.

00:52:18.270 --> 00:52:19.390
MARISHA: What did that do,
oh, that was--

00:52:19.420 --> 00:52:21.720
LAURA: That gives you advantage
on wisdom saving throws,

00:52:21.750 --> 00:52:23.210
death saving throws,

00:52:23.240 --> 00:52:25.750
regains max number of
hit points for healing.

00:52:25.780 --> 00:52:28.150
MATT: Or it would, possibly.

00:52:28.180 --> 00:52:29.780
SAM: Oh, shit.

00:52:29.810 --> 00:52:31.120
There's interferon.

00:52:31.150 --> 00:52:33.570
LIAM: Gilmore stabs Vax.

00:52:33.600 --> 00:52:35.120
LAURA: I'm hitting him
with the laser.

00:52:35.150 --> 00:52:38.660
SAM: Don't blind our DM.

00:52:38.690 --> 00:52:42.690
TALIESIN: I can't see the die, I'm gonna
assume it was an natural 20.

00:52:42.720 --> 00:52:45.630
MATT: I'd roll again.

00:52:45.660 --> 00:52:48.360
There we go, that's
we're looking for.

00:52:48.390 --> 00:52:52.240
Okay.

00:52:52.270 --> 00:52:54.300
It's a natural 20,
so yeah.

00:52:54.330 --> 00:52:58.300
There is a burst of
greenish blue arcane energy

00:52:58.330 --> 00:52:59.870
that just kind of...

00:53:00.060 --> 00:53:02.090
around Pike as she
tries to cast the spell.

00:53:02.120 --> 00:53:03.360
The spell fizzles.

00:53:03.390 --> 00:53:04.870
MARISHA: She got counter spelled.

00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:06.630
LAURA: Oh!

00:53:06.660 --> 00:53:08.030
I hate her!

00:53:08.060 --> 00:53:09.390
TRAVIS: We're in a
no magic zone.

00:53:09.420 --> 00:53:11.240
LAURA: No, it's just--

00:53:11.270 --> 00:53:14.240
SAM: No magic works here.

00:53:14.270 --> 00:53:15.510
Don't even try.

00:53:15.540 --> 00:53:16.630
LAURA: Alright.

00:53:16.660 --> 00:53:18.780
TRAVIS: Just ruins everything
I was gonna do.

00:53:18.780 --> 00:53:20.440
LAURA: Great.

00:53:21.090 --> 00:53:23.180
TALIESIN: It's okay, she burned
a counterspell.

00:53:23.210 --> 00:53:24.240
LAURA: Great.

00:53:24.270 --> 00:53:26.330
MATT: Scanlan, your turn.

00:53:26.360 --> 00:53:28.450
SAM: I move as far as I can.

00:53:28.480 --> 00:53:30.870
-MATT: You...
-SAM: Did I make it in?

00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:33.950
MATT: Running up, you're like
just on the outskirts.

00:53:33.950 --> 00:53:37.390
You get caught up right about
there in the center of the room.

00:53:37.420 --> 00:53:39.750
That's as far
as you can get.

00:53:39.780 --> 00:53:41.000
SAM: Alright.

00:53:41.030 --> 00:53:42.300
Can I yell out?

00:53:42.330 --> 00:53:43.330
MATT: Yes.

00:53:43.360 --> 00:53:46.030
SAM: "Where's Raishan?"

00:53:46.060 --> 00:53:50.090
LAURA: (coughing)

00:53:50.120 --> 00:53:52.060
LIAM: "Ceiling."

00:53:52.090 --> 00:53:53.270
TRAVIS: "I just got here."

00:53:53.300 --> 00:53:55.660
LIAM: "She's in the
fucking ceiling, man."

00:53:55.690 --> 00:53:57.270
SAM: "She's in the ceiling?"

00:53:57.300 --> 00:53:58.300
LIAM: "Yeah."

00:53:58.300 --> 00:54:00.340
LAURA: (coughing)

00:54:00.340 --> 00:54:01.810
LIAM: I'm sorry: Alien.

00:54:01.840 --> 00:54:03.430
Ceiling!

00:54:05.060 --> 00:54:06.690
MARISHA: They're in the walls.

00:54:06.720 --> 00:54:08.440
The goddamn walls.

00:54:08.440 --> 00:54:11.150
MATT: It would have taken you
moving action to get there.

00:54:11.150 --> 00:54:13.320
You have a bonus
if you want to take it.

00:54:13.320 --> 00:54:15.390
SAM: Bonus?

00:54:15.420 --> 00:54:19.510
Bonus, I will-- shit.

00:54:19.540 --> 00:54:21.390
TALIESIN: You'll shit?

00:54:21.420 --> 00:54:22.840
-SAM: Bonus.
-LIAM: True to form.

00:54:22.870 --> 00:54:25.150
SAM: No, I'll heal
myself again.

00:54:25.180 --> 00:54:27.390
I'll do a second level.

00:54:27.420 --> 00:54:28.390
MATT: Healing Word?

00:54:28.420 --> 00:54:30.570
-SAM: Healing Word.
-MATT: Go for it.

00:54:30.600 --> 00:54:31.660
SAM: So that's 2d4 plus--

00:54:31.690 --> 00:54:32.810
MATT: 2d4 plus six, yeah.

00:54:32.840 --> 00:54:34.150
MARISHA: Oh, yay.

00:54:34.180 --> 00:54:35.240
SAM: Twelve, okay.

00:54:35.270 --> 00:54:36.420
MARISHA: That's better,
that's good.

00:54:36.450 --> 00:54:37.450
Good job.

00:54:37.480 --> 00:54:38.630
Good job.

00:54:38.660 --> 00:54:41.480
-SAM: Gerd jerb.
-TALIESIN: Gerd jerb.

00:54:42.150 --> 00:54:43.720
SAM: Great, I'll take it.

00:54:43.750 --> 00:54:45.660
Back up to something.

00:54:45.690 --> 00:54:47.120
MATT: Perfect.

00:54:48.920 --> 00:54:50.030
Let's see here.

00:54:50.030 --> 00:54:51.390
That ends Scanlan's turn.

00:54:51.420 --> 00:54:53.030
Percy, you're up.

00:54:53.060 --> 00:54:55.360
TALIESIN: Alright, I'm gonna use Animus

00:54:55.390 --> 00:54:58.360
and I'm gonna take
some potshots at that

00:54:58.390 --> 00:55:02.060
egg that's on
the other side of Grog.

00:55:02.060 --> 00:55:03.740
-MATT: Over here?
-TALIESIN: Yeah.

00:55:03.740 --> 00:55:05.760
Is that one of the
dead one or is that the--

00:55:05.760 --> 00:55:07.420
MATT: That was the one that
Keyleth just punched.

00:55:07.450 --> 00:55:08.540
TALIESIN: That you just
punched through?

00:55:08.570 --> 00:55:09.660
MARISHA: Uh-huh.

00:55:09.690 --> 00:55:11.550
TALIESIN: Okay, in that case,
I'm gonna keep--

00:55:11.550 --> 00:55:13.850
MATT: You see no other eggs
where you currently are.

00:55:13.850 --> 00:55:16.130
MATT: Except the one
that's right over here.

00:55:16.130 --> 00:55:18.120
You could technically fire at
the one that's across the way.

00:55:18.120 --> 00:55:22.300
TALIESIN: I'm gonna actually start
walking along the wall.

00:55:22.330 --> 00:55:25.210
This way as
far as I can go.

00:55:25.240 --> 00:55:26.330
LIAM: Oh, he's sticking
to it, yeah.

00:55:26.360 --> 00:55:27.690
TALIESIN: Yeah.

00:55:27.720 --> 00:55:28.690
MARISHA: That's cool.

00:55:28.720 --> 00:55:30.180
LAURA: Hey, look, an egg.

00:55:30.210 --> 00:55:31.450
TALIESIN: And I know, like, I'm too
close to shoot at that egg,

00:55:31.480 --> 00:55:32.540
but I can shoot at--

00:55:32.570 --> 00:55:33.750
MARISHA: It's like an
Easter egg hunt.

00:55:33.780 --> 00:55:34.750
LAURA: But you're above it.

00:55:34.780 --> 00:55:36.090
Aren't you high
on the wall?

00:55:36.120 --> 00:55:38.190
TALIESIN: Technically, I am
far away enough from it that I shouldn't--

00:55:38.190 --> 00:55:40.120
MATT: Do you want to go
further on here

00:55:40.150 --> 00:55:41.390
or on this alcove here?

00:55:41.420 --> 00:55:43.460
TALIESIN: Further like--
like this direction.

00:55:43.460 --> 00:55:44.940
I want to
head this way.

00:55:44.940 --> 00:55:46.940
MATT: Okay, so you're moving
across the wall.

00:55:46.940 --> 00:55:48.900
You end at about
there at full movement.

00:55:48.900 --> 00:55:51.030
TALIESIN: Okay, and I'm too
close to the egg

00:55:51.030 --> 00:55:52.820
to get a clean shot
at it right now, right?

00:55:52.820 --> 00:55:54.580
-MATT: Well, I mean--
-TALIESIN: I've got some height, so.

00:55:54.580 --> 00:55:55.840
MATT: Yeah, you could--

00:55:55.870 --> 00:55:57.780
TALIESIN: I'm using a
one-handed, so.

00:55:57.810 --> 00:55:59.540
I'm gonna
fire with Animus.

00:55:59.570 --> 00:56:01.120
I'm gonna take three pot shots at it

00:56:01.150 --> 00:56:03.240
with Sharpshooter.

00:56:06.030 --> 00:56:07.280
Shot number one.

00:56:09.030 --> 00:56:11.000
Yay, that could
have been terrible.

00:56:11.030 --> 00:56:13.180
-26.
-MATT: 26 hits.

00:56:13.210 --> 00:56:15.780
TALIESIN: Should I just roll
all three and then do damage?

00:56:15.780 --> 00:56:17.210
-MATT: Sure.
-TALIESIN: Okay.

00:56:17.240 --> 00:56:20.270
26, um, 14.

00:56:20.300 --> 00:56:22.030
MATT: Fourteen does not hit.

00:56:22.060 --> 00:56:23.660
-TALIESIN: That's fine.
-MARISHA: Oh, man.

00:56:23.690 --> 00:56:26.060
♪

00:56:26.090 --> 00:56:28.150
TALIESIN: And 16.

00:56:28.180 --> 00:56:29.570
MATT: Sixteen does not hit.

00:56:29.600 --> 00:56:32.180
TALIESIN: Okay, I'm firing really
terribly, but that's okay.

00:56:32.180 --> 00:56:33.780
LIAM: Hanging off a wall.

00:56:33.810 --> 00:56:36.100
TALIESIN: Hanging off a wall,
this is new.

00:56:37.210 --> 00:56:39.390
Let me get my dice.

00:56:41.180 --> 00:56:42.540
That's alright.

00:56:46.090 --> 00:56:49.330
Twenty-three points of damage
plus four psychic damage.

00:56:49.360 --> 00:56:51.030
MATT: Okay.

00:56:51.060 --> 00:56:52.860
Alright, so,
first shot.

00:56:52.860 --> 00:56:55.000
It pierces through and actually
cracks part of the egg.

00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:57.240
You can see it's almost
like a spider spiral

00:56:57.270 --> 00:56:59.330
where the egg
interior cracks inward.

00:56:59.360 --> 00:57:00.780
It pierces and a
little bit of dark liquid

00:57:00.810 --> 00:57:02.480
begins to pool out of it.

00:57:02.510 --> 00:57:04.390
That's as much as you make
as the next two shots

00:57:04.420 --> 00:57:06.780
seem to ricochet
off of its hard shell.

00:57:06.810 --> 00:57:09.300
TALIESIN: Alright, that's my--

00:57:10.030 --> 00:57:11.750
Yeah, I'm just gonna
use my bonus to reload

00:57:11.780 --> 00:57:12.810
and take some more shots.

00:57:12.840 --> 00:57:14.780
TRAVIS: ♪ Dancing on the ceiling ♪

00:57:14.810 --> 00:57:17.810

SAM: Best music video.

MATT: Okay.

00:57:22.450 --> 00:57:23.810
SAM: It's like a piñata.

00:57:27.870 --> 00:57:29.240
¿No sé?

00:57:31.330 --> 00:57:32.810
MATT: Okay.

00:57:32.840 --> 00:57:34.840
Suddenly, the entire
lair begins to shake.

00:57:34.870 --> 00:57:36.360
-TRAVIS: Shit.
-TALIESIN: Goddammit.

00:57:36.390 --> 00:57:38.880
MATT: Like this tremor
begins to emanate

00:57:38.880 --> 00:57:41.720
from the ceiling
portion of this.

00:57:41.750 --> 00:57:44.390
Pieces of rock begin to...

00:57:44.420 --> 00:57:46.480
Fall from the ceiling.

00:57:46.510 --> 00:57:48.420
I need...

00:57:49.330 --> 00:57:51.240
The guys who
are flying, so,

00:57:51.270 --> 00:57:54.720
Keyleth, Vax and Vex,
don't worry about this.

00:57:54.750 --> 00:57:59.390
Everyone else, I need you to
make a dexterity saving throw.

00:57:59.420 --> 00:58:02.000
SAM: Even me, I'm
barely in the room?

00:58:02.030 --> 00:58:05.030
MATT: It's a big radius.

00:58:05.060 --> 00:58:07.630
SAM: I got one foot out.

00:58:07.660 --> 00:58:08.690
What is it dex--?

00:58:08.720 --> 00:58:10.270
MATT: Dexterity.

00:58:10.300 --> 00:58:11.510
TALIESIN: That's better.

00:58:11.540 --> 00:58:12.840
TRAVIS: Ten.

00:58:12.870 --> 00:58:14.810
SAM: Seventeen.

00:58:14.840 --> 00:58:16.510
TALIESIN: Fifteen.

-MATT: Okay.
-LAURA: Five.

00:58:18.090 --> 00:58:20.360
MATT: Five, okay.

00:58:20.390 --> 00:58:22.300
-Pike...
-LAURA: Oh, I'm sorry.

00:58:22.330 --> 00:58:26.450
TRAVIS: Grog both lose your footing
and plummet backward.

00:58:26.480 --> 00:58:28.480
Gilmore rolls a
natural 20, he's fine.

00:58:28.510 --> 00:58:30.000

00:58:33.780 --> 00:58:36.510
Great dodger,
since I was 12."

00:58:38.030 --> 00:58:40.240
Yeah, Percy, you mange
to just barely hold on

00:58:40.270 --> 00:58:41.810
without losing your the--

00:58:41.840 --> 00:58:43.510
TALIESIN: Thankfully my
spider sense tingled.

00:58:43.540 --> 00:58:44.780
-MATT: Oh!
-MARISHA: Oh!

00:58:44.780 --> 00:58:47.150
MATT: I almost want you to
just go home for that.

00:58:47.180 --> 00:58:48.770
TALIESIN: Now I'm gonna fall.

00:58:48.770 --> 00:58:50.530
TRAVIS: A whole bunch
of cheese here.

00:58:50.530 --> 00:58:51.630
MATT: Yep.

00:58:51.660 --> 00:58:53.090
Okay.

00:58:53.120 --> 00:58:54.240
That ends the lair action.

00:58:54.270 --> 00:58:56.380
LAURA: Next turn with disadvantage.

00:58:56.380 --> 00:58:57.810
(laughing)

00:58:57.840 --> 00:59:00.250
MATT: It is now Raishan's turn.

00:59:00.250 --> 00:59:02.050
LAURA: Oh, that was
a lair action?

00:59:02.050 --> 00:59:03.890
-MATT: Yeah.
-LAURA: Oh, Jesus.

00:59:03.890 --> 00:59:06.260
TRAVIS: We should just call
that Raishan's turn.

00:59:06.260 --> 00:59:07.220
MATT: Nah.

00:59:09.270 --> 00:59:11.660
You watch as through
the cloud of lightning

00:59:11.690 --> 00:59:16.030
that's kind of swirling,
a small dragon-like form

00:59:16.060 --> 00:59:18.270
just pierces through
momentarily.

00:59:18.300 --> 00:59:19.600
It's still see-through.

00:59:19.630 --> 00:59:23.050
You can see the rest
of the swirling storm around it,

00:59:23.050 --> 00:59:25.630
but it's enough of that
Predator-like appearance,

00:59:25.660 --> 00:59:28.060
where it just
shapes and shimmies,

00:59:28.090 --> 00:59:29.750
or shimmers
through the vicinity.

00:59:29.780 --> 00:59:32.090
It shimmies through.

00:59:33.150 --> 00:59:35.720
As it does, you watch
this claw kind of lift up

00:59:35.750 --> 00:59:37.750
as this low
echoing voice...

00:59:37.780 --> 00:59:41.330
(whispering in foreign language)

00:59:41.360 --> 00:59:42.480
LAURA: This is all of
us with the light.

00:59:42.510 --> 00:59:44.330
All of us
with the heat.

00:59:44.360 --> 00:59:45.570
TALIESIN: Okay, what is this?

00:59:45.600 --> 00:59:47.450
LAURA: It's gonna do something,
I know it.

00:59:47.480 --> 00:59:50.360
TALIESIN: We're-- we're all--

00:59:50.390 --> 00:59:51.840
MATT: Okay, 30 foot cubes.

00:59:51.870 --> 00:59:54.600
TALIESIN: We're all just gonna turn inside
out and that'll be the end.

00:59:54.630 --> 00:59:56.180
TRAVIS: We'll all turn
into chickens.

00:59:56.180 --> 00:59:58.030
TALIESIN: It's gonna be like
John Carpenter's The Thing.

00:59:58.060 --> 01:00:00.210
TRAVIS: And then the eggs will
turn into big chickens.

01:00:00.240 --> 01:00:03.120
LIAM: First, we'll all
mash together.

01:00:03.150 --> 01:00:05.600
TALIESIN: And then get separated
out into equal piles.

01:00:05.630 --> 01:00:06.870
LAURA: Oh, geez.

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:08.390
MATT: Yeah, 30 foot cube.

01:00:08.420 --> 01:00:11.720
I can only get-- she can
only get Vex, Pike and Grog,

01:00:11.720 --> 01:00:13.380
but I need the
three of you to make

01:00:13.380 --> 01:00:14.840
a constitution
saving throw.

01:00:14.840 --> 01:00:16.180
TRAVIS: Constitution?

01:00:16.210 --> 01:00:17.240
MATT: Yes.

01:00:17.270 --> 01:00:18.330
LAURA: Damn it!

01:00:18.360 --> 01:00:19.480
TALIESIN: ♪ Constitution ♪

01:00:19.510 --> 01:00:21.300
♪ Come on ♪♪

01:00:21.330 --> 01:00:23.270
-LIAM: Yeah.
-LAURA: So, that's good.

01:00:23.300 --> 01:00:24.720
I don't get
any bonus though.

01:00:24.750 --> 01:00:26.420
Twenty-one?

01:00:26.450 --> 01:00:27.480
TALIESIN: Nice.

01:00:27.510 --> 01:00:28.480
LIAM: Oh, thank God.

01:00:28.510 --> 01:00:30.480
-TRAVIS: Twenty-seven.
-MATT: Okay, and Pike?

01:00:30.510 --> 01:00:31.630
LAURA: Oh, oh.

01:00:31.660 --> 01:00:32.630
You roll for Pike.

01:00:32.660 --> 01:00:34.120
LIAM: Okay.

01:00:34.150 --> 01:00:35.240
She gets the meteor.

01:00:35.270 --> 01:00:36.720
I hope it's good.

01:00:36.750 --> 01:00:39.330
-It's a one.
-LAURA: Oh, no!

01:00:39.360 --> 01:00:42.330
MATT: Well, Vex and
Pike both failed.

01:00:42.360 --> 01:00:46.390
LAURA: Oh, that's as high as I get
without a natural 20, man!

01:00:46.420 --> 01:00:48.270
MATT: It's a spell DC of 22, I'm sorry.

01:00:48.300 --> 01:00:49.750
SAM: Whoa.

01:00:49.780 --> 01:00:52.750
MATT: You and Pike both suffer 57
points of necrotic damage.

01:00:52.780 --> 01:00:54.720
LAURA: Fucking shit!

01:00:54.750 --> 01:00:56.180
TRAVIS: Oh, fuck.

01:00:56.210 --> 01:01:01.150
MATT: Grog, you take
half as much.

01:01:01.180 --> 01:01:04.700
So, it'd be 28.

01:01:04.700 --> 01:01:06.720
Twenty-eight points
necrotic damage.

01:01:06.750 --> 01:01:09.810
Suddenly, you feel the
very air itself go gray.

01:01:09.840 --> 01:01:12.300
The color is taken
from your vision

01:01:12.330 --> 01:01:14.480
and your life force
is drawn out of you

01:01:14.510 --> 01:01:18.210
through Abi-Dalzim's
Horrid Wilting.

01:01:18.240 --> 01:01:20.300
-SAM: Horde wilting?
-MATT: Horrid wilting.

01:01:20.330 --> 01:01:22.180
The air is drawn
from your lungs.

01:01:22.210 --> 01:01:24.660
You feel your skin crack and
tighten against your skeleton.

01:01:24.660 --> 01:01:26.300
MARISHA: Adele Dazeem's--

01:01:26.330 --> 01:01:28.100
MATT: Adele Dazeem's
Horrid Wilting.

01:01:28.100 --> 01:01:30.180
(laughing)

01:01:30.210 --> 01:01:33.390
TRAVIS: Amazing, yes.

01:01:33.420 --> 01:01:35.690
Change it, don't
ever say it right.

01:01:35.720 --> 01:01:37.780
MATT: That's what it is now going forward.

01:01:37.810 --> 01:01:39.330
LAURA: Man!

01:01:39.360 --> 01:01:40.540
SAM: Are you alive?

01:01:40.570 --> 01:01:42.330
LAURA: No, I'm-- I'm unconscious,
so is Pike.

01:01:42.360 --> 01:01:44.260
-Both of us.
-MATT: Oh, shit.

01:01:44.260 --> 01:01:45.780
Well, Pike is
not unconscious.

01:01:45.810 --> 01:01:47.450
(gasps)

01:01:47.480 --> 01:01:49.030
LAURA: Pike came back.

01:01:49.060 --> 01:01:50.920
MATT: Wait, did her armor
get used last battle?

01:01:50.920 --> 01:01:52.330
-I don't think it did.
-LAURA: It didn't?

01:01:52.360 --> 01:01:54.510
TRAVIS: It got used once,
where was it?

01:01:54.540 --> 01:01:56.510
TALIESIN: Previously, in
a previous battle.

01:01:56.540 --> 01:01:57.750
-LAURA: Against?
-TALIESIN: Fire giant.

01:01:57.780 --> 01:01:59.570
LAURA: Oh, yeah.

01:01:59.600 --> 01:02:01.030
TALIESIN: How do I remember this?

01:02:01.060 --> 01:02:02.390
That's horrifying.

01:02:02.420 --> 01:02:04.180
MATT: The fire giant of--

01:02:04.210 --> 01:02:06.360
TALIESIN: At the battle at the--

01:02:06.390 --> 01:02:08.420
-LIAM: In the fire fort.
-MATT: To the fort, yes.

01:02:08.450 --> 01:02:09.480
LAURA: Oh, at Fort Daxio.

01:02:09.510 --> 01:02:11.090
-LIAM: Yep, yep, yep.
-MATT: You are correct.

01:02:11.090 --> 01:02:13.420
LAURA: Okay, so Pike's alive.

01:02:13.450 --> 01:02:16.030
-MATT: With how many hit points?

01:02:16.060 --> 01:02:18.360
MARISHA: Jesus, that was an eighth
level necromancy spell.

01:02:18.390 --> 01:02:21.000
LAURA: No, no, no, she got
five hit points.

01:02:21.030 --> 01:02:22.810
MATT: So, Pike is at
five hit points.

01:02:22.840 --> 01:02:25.330
LAURA: And are there any eggs
within 15 feet of her?

01:02:25.360 --> 01:02:26.570
MATT: Nope.

01:02:26.600 --> 01:02:28.300
LAURA: Is there a Raishan
within 15 feet of her?

01:02:28.330 --> 01:02:30.480
-MATT: Nope.
-LAURA: Well, then, fuck it.

01:02:30.510 --> 01:02:33.720
MATT: But Vex plummets out of the
poison cloud off of her broom,

01:02:33.750 --> 01:02:35.810
slams into the
ground and clatters,

01:02:35.840 --> 01:02:39.760
spinning and falling
to the ground not moving.

01:02:39.760 --> 01:02:42.480
LAURA: Thanks for knocking
over the little cube too.

01:02:42.510 --> 01:02:44.330
I like that added.

01:02:44.360 --> 01:02:47.450
TALIESIN: Backhanding it, no less.

01:02:47.480 --> 01:02:49.540
-TRAVIS: Damn.
-MATT: Alrighty.

01:02:49.570 --> 01:02:53.270
TRAVIS: Are there lasting effects
from Adele Nazeem's wilting?

01:02:53.300 --> 01:02:55.360
Like are we halved
or anything?

01:02:55.390 --> 01:02:58.240
-MATT: From what you know, no.
-LAURA: "From what you know."

01:02:58.270 --> 01:03:00.150
TRAVIS: It just sucks right
now is all I know.

01:03:00.180 --> 01:03:01.210
Everything just sucks.

01:03:01.240 --> 01:03:02.450
SAM: Jesus!

01:03:02.480 --> 01:03:03.840
LAURA: Yeah.

01:03:03.870 --> 01:03:05.440
TRAVIS: Okay.

01:03:06.270 --> 01:03:08.330
MATT: So, that-- that is gonna
end Raishan's turn.

01:03:08.360 --> 01:03:11.740
The form is still somewhat
visible, though, transparent.

01:03:11.740 --> 01:03:14.150
It took her full movement
to even get to that point.

01:03:14.180 --> 01:03:16.400
MARISHA: And where is she,
she still on the ceiling?

01:03:16.400 --> 01:03:18.540
MATT: To give you a position, right now...

01:03:18.540 --> 01:03:22.780
♪

01:03:22.810 --> 01:03:25.930
It's right there.

01:03:25.930 --> 01:03:27.330
SAM: Forty, fifty feet up?

01:03:27.360 --> 01:03:29.140
MATT: Though transparent.

01:03:31.060 --> 01:03:32.770
It's 50 feet up.

01:03:34.750 --> 01:03:36.600
TRAVIS: Fuck.

01:03:36.630 --> 01:03:38.370
TALIESIN: Oh, don't do that then.

01:03:38.370 --> 01:03:40.720
LAURA: Oh, I just remembered.

01:03:40.750 --> 01:03:42.750
TALIESIN: You left the gas on.

01:03:45.330 --> 01:03:47.300
TRAVIS: And she's 40, 40 up?

01:03:47.330 --> 01:03:49.330
MATT: Fifty feet up.

01:03:49.360 --> 01:03:50.840
SAM: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

01:03:50.870 --> 01:03:53.270
MATT: So, Keyleth, what
are you doing?

01:03:53.300 --> 01:03:54.630
MARISHA: Okay.

01:03:56.760 --> 01:03:58.350
I can still see her a little bit.

01:03:58.350 --> 01:04:00.210
SAM: This is a dragon fight, guys.

01:04:00.240 --> 01:04:03.840
MATT: Yeah, you can barely make
out the-- the outline.

01:04:03.870 --> 01:04:06.570
MARISHA: Okay, so since
she's in my cloud,

01:04:06.600 --> 01:04:08.270
I'm going to kind of like,

01:04:08.300 --> 01:04:11.630
do one of those sideways
arcing lightning strikes.

01:04:11.660 --> 01:04:12.840
Just...

01:04:12.870 --> 01:04:16.120
and arc everything
right towards that bitch.

01:04:16.150 --> 01:04:18.690
MATT: Great, go for it.

01:04:18.720 --> 01:04:20.540
MARISHA: She just takes
damage, right?

01:04:20.570 --> 01:04:23.000
MATT: For Call Lightning, no,
you have to roll--

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:26.000
No, sorry, a creature has to
make a dexterity saving throw.

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:27.780
So, what's your DC?

01:04:27.810 --> 01:04:30.440
-MARISHA: Twenty.
-MATT: Twenty?

01:04:31.660 --> 01:04:34.420
LAURA: How many lightnings
are heading towards her?

01:04:34.450 --> 01:04:35.570
MATT: Nineteen.

01:04:35.600 --> 01:04:37.180
Total of ten plus nine.

01:04:37.210 --> 01:04:40.300
-MARISHA: Yes!
-TRAVIS: Wow!

01:04:40.330 --> 01:04:41.510
MATT: That's 4d10.

01:04:41.540 --> 01:04:42.540
MARISHA: Yes, it is!

01:04:42.570 --> 01:04:44.400
-SAM: Whoa.
-MATT: Lightning damage.

01:04:44.400 --> 01:04:45.950
MARISHA: Yep, yep!

01:04:49.210 --> 01:04:50.330
4d10.

01:04:50.360 --> 01:04:52.000
-Okay, I rolled that.
-TALIESIN: You rolled well.

01:04:52.030 --> 01:04:53.270
MARISHA: I rolled okay.

01:04:53.300 --> 01:04:56.060
I actually rolled--
did roll real well.

01:04:56.060 --> 01:04:57.540
You're right,
I rolled well.

01:04:57.570 --> 01:04:59.000
Nine, nine, 18.

01:04:59.030 --> 01:05:03.630
Plus eight,
that is 26 damage.

01:05:03.660 --> 01:05:05.420
MATT: Nice.

01:05:05.450 --> 01:05:08.840
You watch as the form tries to
pull itself back into the cloud,

01:05:08.870 --> 01:05:11.750
the cloud lights up
with this crackling

01:05:11.780 --> 01:05:13.240
reddish pink
electrical energy

01:05:13.270 --> 01:05:15.540
that then turns to
a bright burning red

01:05:15.570 --> 01:05:17.510
as it arcs past
and slams into her.

01:05:17.540 --> 01:05:19.150
You watch the energy arc

01:05:19.180 --> 01:05:20.750
across the body of
Raishan, the dragon.

01:05:20.780 --> 01:05:22.870
(snarling)

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.600
TALIESIN: Does she have to make
a concentration save?

01:05:25.600 --> 01:05:27.900
-MATT: She does.
-TALIESIN: To remain invisible?

01:05:29.360 --> 01:05:31.270
MATT: Yeah, she's fine.

01:05:31.300 --> 01:05:33.060
TRAVIS: "Yeah, she's fine."

01:05:33.090 --> 01:05:34.240
Fifty-seven.

01:05:34.270 --> 01:05:35.750
MARISHA: I still have
movement, right?

01:05:35.750 --> 01:05:36.690
MATT: You do, yes.

01:05:36.720 --> 01:05:38.420
Your full movement,
you haven't moved yet.

01:05:38.420 --> 01:05:40.450
You just pulled it
down in that one moment.

01:05:40.480 --> 01:05:43.890
MARISHA: I am going to head towards
the egg that got cracked open

01:05:43.890 --> 01:05:45.720
that's in the center there.

01:05:45.750 --> 01:05:46.720
MATT: Over there?

01:05:46.750 --> 01:05:48.420
-MARISHA: Yeah.
-MATT: Okay.

01:05:48.450 --> 01:05:51.330
You can go all
the way over to it.

01:05:51.360 --> 01:05:54.510
MARISHA: Can I do a bonus action
to like, examine?

01:05:54.510 --> 01:05:56.520
MATT: I mean, you can make a
perception check and look at it.

01:05:56.520 --> 01:05:57.870
If you want to
rummage through it,

01:05:57.870 --> 01:05:59.540
that'll probably
take your action.

01:05:59.540 --> 01:06:01.490
MARISHA: Okay, I'll do just a
perception check right now.

01:06:01.490 --> 01:06:02.540
MATT: Okay.

01:06:02.570 --> 01:06:03.840
MARISHA: Twenty-three.

01:06:03.870 --> 01:06:05.660
MATT: Okay, as
soon as you rush up

01:06:05.660 --> 01:06:07.660
and get a glance at it,

01:06:07.690 --> 01:06:12.570
you can see that a lot of the
dark, purplish maroon fluid

01:06:12.600 --> 01:06:14.300
that filled most of the egg

01:06:14.330 --> 01:06:16.630
is just coating the
outside of the egg's shell

01:06:16.660 --> 01:06:20.540
and there are a series of
rocks and pieces of rubble

01:06:20.570 --> 01:06:22.720
from the initial
meteor swam impact

01:06:22.750 --> 01:06:24.750
that has just
sundered this egg.

01:06:24.780 --> 01:06:26.390
It's about half the
height of the others,

01:06:26.420 --> 01:06:28.900
it's just all that's been
kinda collapsed inward.

01:06:28.900 --> 01:06:30.350
This egg is ruined.

01:06:30.350 --> 01:06:32.630
TALIESIN: So, we have two ruined
eggs at this point.

01:06:32.630 --> 01:06:34.180
MARISHA: And no sign of a--

01:06:34.210 --> 01:06:35.570
SAM: And one almost ruined.

01:06:35.600 --> 01:06:38.830
MARISHA: And no sign of
a dragon baby?

01:06:38.830 --> 01:06:40.390
MATT: Nothing you can see.

01:06:40.420 --> 01:06:41.450
MARISHA: Alright.

01:06:41.480 --> 01:06:43.890
TALIESIN: Might be just deep
in there and flattened.

01:06:43.890 --> 01:06:46.000
MARISHA: Flattened, yeah,
that's my turn.

01:06:46.030 --> 01:06:48.480
TALIESIN: Could have just
been a bad egg.

01:06:48.510 --> 01:06:51.330
MATT: Ending Keyleth's turn,
that brings us to Gilmore.

01:06:51.360 --> 01:06:53.110
Gilmore watching
this happen,

01:06:53.110 --> 01:06:55.240
watching Vex go down.

01:06:56.240 --> 01:06:58.090
Let's see what he does here.

01:06:58.120 --> 01:07:00.060
(indistinct muttering)

01:07:08.600 --> 01:07:10.030
MARISHA: Oh, that's funny.

01:07:10.060 --> 01:07:11.750
TALIESIN: Like five of
them in here.

01:07:11.750 --> 01:07:13.210
Do something about this.

01:07:13.240 --> 01:07:16.450
MATT: Okay, as Raishan's form
is up there he goes,

01:07:16.480 --> 01:07:18.330
(sighs)

01:07:18.360 --> 01:07:20.420
"Not today, not ever!"

01:07:20.450 --> 01:07:22.240
And releases
his hand like this

01:07:22.240 --> 01:07:27.430
and you watch as a burst
of strangely shifting

01:07:28.180 --> 01:07:31.420
rippling arcane energy
similar to the same ripple

01:07:31.450 --> 01:07:34.660
that is shrouding Raishan

01:07:34.690 --> 01:07:37.090
seems to kind of scatter
up in that direction.

01:07:37.120 --> 01:07:38.840
He's going to attempt to...

01:07:38.870 --> 01:07:40.250
MARISHA: Come on.

01:07:42.060 --> 01:07:45.390
MATT: With his successful
dispel magic, Raishan--

01:07:45.420 --> 01:07:48.300
the form becomes
completely visible now.

01:07:48.330 --> 01:07:51.630
The invisibility
has worn off.

01:07:51.660 --> 01:07:53.780
And is now standing
completely visible.

01:07:53.810 --> 01:07:55.720
As this happens, Raishan...

01:07:55.750 --> 01:07:57.690
(snarls)

01:07:57.720 --> 01:08:01.270
"I will enjoy eating
the flesh from your bones."

01:08:01.300 --> 01:08:02.300
SAM: Oh.

01:08:02.330 --> 01:08:04.030
Did she say "balls"?

01:08:04.030 --> 01:08:06.030
LAURA: Yeah, definitely.

01:08:06.060 --> 01:08:09.240
MATT: Definitely said balls. No.

01:08:09.270 --> 01:08:10.480
MARISHA: Dragon delicacy.

01:08:10.510 --> 01:08:12.090
MATT: Gilmore is then going to...

01:08:12.120 --> 01:08:16.330
Gilmore goes from
excitement to "Shit."

01:08:16.359 --> 01:08:18.510
TRAVIS: Not my balls!

01:08:18.540 --> 01:08:23.180
MATT: He's going to-- knowing the
tactics that are being used,

01:08:23.210 --> 01:08:26.000
he's gonna try to spread out
form the rest of the group.

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:29.360
Over here towards the
destroyed egg across the wall.

01:08:29.360 --> 01:08:31.359
That's going to
end Gilmore's turn.

01:08:31.390 --> 01:08:33.390
This brings us to Grog.

01:08:33.420 --> 01:08:34.630
TRAVIS: Uh, can I get up, please?

01:08:34.660 --> 01:08:36.600
-MATT: You can.
-TALIESIN: Get on up.

01:08:36.630 --> 01:08:39.210
LAURA: Get on up!

01:08:39.240 --> 01:08:41.720
TRAVIS: Can I see Vex
sprawled out?

01:08:41.750 --> 01:08:42.870
MATT: You do, yes.

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:44.540
TRAVIS: Yeah, can I run to Vex?

01:08:44.569 --> 01:08:46.180
MATT: Sure.

01:08:46.210 --> 01:08:48.630
TRAVIS: (humming)

01:08:48.660 --> 01:08:51.120
I have one really-- what's
the really big potion?

01:08:51.149 --> 01:08:52.870
-Is it the Superior?
-LIAM: Superior.

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:54.120
TRAVIS: I have one of those.

01:08:54.149 --> 01:08:55.689
Can I shove it in her gullet?

01:08:55.720 --> 01:08:57.669
MATT: You can, it'll take
your action to do it.

01:08:57.669 --> 01:08:58.510
LAURA: Oh.

01:08:58.540 --> 01:09:00.810
You don't have
to Grog, it's okay.

01:09:00.840 --> 01:09:02.029
I mean--

01:09:02.060 --> 01:09:03.270
TRAVIS: Okay, I want you
to reroll a character.

01:09:03.300 --> 01:09:04.420
Here we go.

01:09:04.450 --> 01:09:07.090
I'm going to take
my axe and--

01:09:07.120 --> 01:09:10.300
Yeah, I shove
it in her mouth.

01:09:10.330 --> 01:09:12.650
MATT: Superior, that
is 8d4 plus 8.

01:09:12.650 --> 01:09:14.240
TRAVIS: Oh, I got to roll it?

01:09:14.270 --> 01:09:16.089
-MATT: Yeah.
-TRAVIS: Oh, gee-- oh man.

01:09:16.089 --> 01:09:17.710
LAURA: Wait, 8d4.

01:09:20.210 --> 01:09:22.210
(indistinct)

01:09:30.510 --> 01:09:32.479
Whoa, 17.

01:09:37.779 --> 01:09:41.270
-TRAVIS: Twenty-four.
-LIAM: Plus eight.

01:09:41.300 --> 01:09:44.000
-TRAVIS: Thirty-two.
-LAURA: Thirty-two?

01:09:44.029 --> 01:09:45.610
That was insane, Grog!

01:09:48.359 --> 01:09:51.390
MATT: So with that, your eyes
come into focus, Vex,

01:09:51.420 --> 01:09:55.570
as you feel the clatter
of glass against your teeth,

01:09:55.600 --> 01:09:56.780
the vial being
pulled from your mouth.

01:09:56.810 --> 01:09:58.450
You kind of
cough for a second.

01:09:58.480 --> 01:10:01.180
Come into conscious as Grog,
in his giant form,

01:10:01.210 --> 01:10:04.360
cradling you like a tiny baby
in his one giant mitt.

01:10:04.390 --> 01:10:06.750
Just kind of smiles.

01:10:06.780 --> 01:10:07.750
TALIESIN: It's like a
Terry Gilliam movie.

01:10:07.780 --> 01:10:09.390
LAURA: "Thanks."

01:10:09.420 --> 01:10:10.510
(snarls)

01:10:10.540 --> 01:10:11.660
(laughing)

01:10:11.690 --> 01:10:12.850
Go rage!

01:10:12.850 --> 01:10:15.160
MATT: Alright, don't forget you do
have a point of exhaustion,

01:10:15.160 --> 01:10:17.210
as you've gone-- unless
you've continued your rage

01:10:17.240 --> 01:10:18.750
this whole time,
which you can, so never mind.

01:10:18.780 --> 01:10:20.330
TRAVIS: Yeah, just
rolling through.

01:10:20.360 --> 01:10:21.480
MATT: You got that now.

01:10:21.510 --> 01:10:23.070
You're just
like a freak.

01:10:23.070 --> 01:10:25.390
TRAVIS: I might have
chipped a tooth...

01:10:25.420 --> 01:10:26.840
LAURA: All good.

01:10:26.870 --> 01:10:27.840
All good, all good.

01:10:27.870 --> 01:10:30.000
TRAVIS: Like Mentos and Coke.

01:10:30.030 --> 01:10:33.840
MATT: You're like drink it, drink it.

01:10:33.870 --> 01:10:35.720
Alright, great,
that ends Grog's turn.

01:10:35.750 --> 01:10:39.240
Vex, you are conscious,
prone, but conscious.

01:10:39.270 --> 01:10:41.630
LAURA: God, okay.

01:10:41.660 --> 01:10:43.090
Fuck.

01:10:43.120 --> 01:10:46.450
Can I shoot from my
laying down position?

01:10:46.480 --> 01:10:49.240
MATT: You can, I'd say your attacks
would have disadvantage.

01:10:49.270 --> 01:10:52.060
LAURA: Okay, then I'm gonna get
up on my knee and shoot up.

01:10:52.090 --> 01:10:53.750
Cause I just wake up and see
her right above me, don't I?

01:10:53.780 --> 01:10:55.060
MATT: Yep, you do.

01:10:55.090 --> 01:10:57.240
LAURA: Alright, then
I'm gonna try to--

01:10:57.270 --> 01:10:58.300
Oh wait, I already
used Brambleshot,

01:10:58.330 --> 01:10:59.300
or at least,
I tried to today.

01:10:59.330 --> 01:11:00.420
MATT: You did, yeah.

01:11:00.450 --> 01:11:01.600
LAURA: So, I'm gonna shoot her.

01:11:01.630 --> 01:11:02.750
MATT: Do it!

01:11:02.780 --> 01:11:04.390
LAURA: Can I Hunter's Mark
her first, though?

01:11:04.420 --> 01:11:05.780
MATT: You certainly can.

01:11:05.810 --> 01:11:07.650
LAURA: Hey!

01:11:09.330 --> 01:11:10.690
I don't get
sneak attack.

01:11:10.720 --> 01:11:14.120
Nobody's near her, right?

01:11:14.150 --> 01:11:15.780
MATT: That was--
that was great.

01:11:15.810 --> 01:11:18.330
Gilmore rolled a 19 on the dispel.

01:11:18.360 --> 01:11:19.360
LAURA: Nineteen?

01:11:19.390 --> 01:11:20.570
MATT: Yeah, that was
really good.

01:11:20.600 --> 01:11:21.660
LAURA: Oh, that's
what I rolled.

01:11:21.690 --> 01:11:23.150
-MATT: Oh, did you?
-LAURA: As well.

01:11:23.180 --> 01:11:25.540
MATT: Nice, look at that, you 
and Gilmore just synchronizing.

01:11:25.540 --> 01:11:27.610
-MATT: And 19's your total?
-LAURA: Yeah.

01:11:27.610 --> 01:11:30.180
-MATT: Misses.
-LAURA: Fuckin' A.

01:11:30.210 --> 01:11:33.300
That one,
I hope, 28.

01:11:33.330 --> 01:11:34.450
MATT: Hits.

01:11:34.480 --> 01:11:37.120
LAURA: Okay, so 28
on the second one.

01:11:37.150 --> 01:11:39.090
Oh God, what's
happening?

01:11:39.120 --> 01:11:40.750
MARISHA: I don't know.

01:11:46.910 --> 01:11:49.200
LAURA: Sixteen plus three
points of lightning.

01:11:49.200 --> 01:11:51.270
TALIESIN: I'm not gonna
play that game, man.

01:11:51.300 --> 01:11:52.390
Not playing.

01:11:52.420 --> 01:11:54.600
I'm not playing
this game no more.

01:11:54.630 --> 01:11:56.570
It's not the time.

01:11:56.600 --> 01:11:59.450
MATT: Did you include your
damage for it being a dragon?

01:11:59.450 --> 01:12:00.690
LAURA: Yes.

01:12:00.720 --> 01:12:01.840
MATT: Alright.

01:12:01.870 --> 01:12:04.240
So now you can
see Raishan emerging

01:12:04.270 --> 01:12:06.150
from one of the
volcanic caves.

01:12:06.180 --> 01:12:07.270
The storm's
swirling around her,

01:12:07.300 --> 01:12:08.450
as she begins to
pull back into it,

01:12:08.480 --> 01:12:09.570
you fire two arrows.

01:12:09.600 --> 01:12:11.660
One gets lost, the other one--

01:12:11.690 --> 01:12:13.090
(snarling)

01:12:13.120 --> 01:12:14.510
Into the side
of her throat.

01:12:14.540 --> 01:12:16.420
LAURA: Can I move--
can I move...

01:12:16.450 --> 01:12:18.540
MATT: You move three squares.

01:12:18.570 --> 01:12:20.540
LAURA: Can I get on my broom?

01:12:20.570 --> 01:12:23.360
MATT: You get onto
your broom, yeah.

01:12:23.390 --> 01:12:25.660
LAURA: Like move a
one square away.

01:12:25.690 --> 01:12:27.330
-MATT: One square?
-LAURA: Yeah.

01:12:27.360 --> 01:12:29.390
Away from Grog
and Pike, yeah.

01:12:29.420 --> 01:12:30.870
Like that makes
any difference, but--

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.420
-MATT: Okay, perfect.
-TALIESIN: It's a start.

01:12:33.450 --> 01:12:35.090
LAURA: Thanks, Grog.

01:12:35.120 --> 01:12:36.330
TRAVIS: (snarls)

01:12:36.360 --> 01:12:38.360
MATT: Ends Vex's turn,
Vax, you're up.

01:12:38.390 --> 01:12:40.180
LIAM: Okay, just to clarify,
so looking at the minis.

01:12:40.210 --> 01:12:41.630
The back side's
to me, but really,

01:12:41.660 --> 01:12:44.810
her face is poking
out of a hole, right?

01:12:44.840 --> 01:12:46.120
MATT: Like the front half is.

01:12:46.150 --> 01:12:47.660
LIAM: Front half of
her and she's--

01:12:47.690 --> 01:12:50.000
and she's at the roof
which is 70 feet up,

01:12:50.030 --> 01:12:53.000
so maybe her head is
down, like, five feet out,

01:12:53.030 --> 01:12:54.000
ten feet out,
something like that?

01:12:54.030 --> 01:12:55.330
MATT: Roughly, yeah.

01:12:55.360 --> 01:12:57.420
LIAM: Alright, I want to,
and I'm--I'm back, right?

01:12:57.450 --> 01:12:58.780
-After...
-MATT: You have now--

01:12:58.810 --> 01:13:00.150
Yeah, you've regained
your composure.

01:13:00.180 --> 01:13:02.060
However your other
potion has now worn off.

01:13:02.090 --> 01:13:06.120
-You are no longer--
-LAURA: Invulnerable?

01:13:06.150 --> 01:13:09.180
-LIAM: I want to fly--
-LAURA: Oh!

01:13:09.210 --> 01:13:11.390
-LIAM: Go ahead.
-LAURA: My hasted had worn off, right?

01:13:11.420 --> 01:13:13.540
I just assumed
it had, okay.

01:13:13.570 --> 01:13:17.330
LIAM: So, if I'm 15 feet up
and she's, maybe, 65 down,

01:13:17.360 --> 01:13:20.360
I'm within range for
sharpshooter already.

01:13:20.390 --> 01:13:21.480
MATT: Technically, yeah.

01:13:21.510 --> 01:13:23.660
LIAM: So, and-- and
last question.

01:13:23.690 --> 01:13:25.660
When you do-- for
duel wielding, action--

01:13:25.690 --> 01:13:27.480
bonus action, but you told
me once you can reverse that

01:13:27.510 --> 01:13:29.090
and do bonus
action and action.

01:13:29.120 --> 01:13:30.870
I think.

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.240
MATT: The bonus attack is part
of your attack action,

01:13:33.270 --> 01:13:34.270
so it's actually
after your--

01:13:34.300 --> 01:13:35.420
LIAM: Never mind then.

01:13:35.450 --> 01:13:37.540
I'm gonna fly
straight at her face,

01:13:37.570 --> 01:13:40.240
and I'm gonna shove the Dragon
Slayer sword into her mouth

01:13:40.270 --> 01:13:42.420
and I want to try to sever her
fucking tongue out of her mouth.

01:13:42.450 --> 01:13:47.270
-SAM: Oh!
-LAURA: Whoa!

01:13:47.300 --> 01:13:48.750
LIAM: Terrible.

01:13:48.780 --> 01:13:51.540
Whisper, I'm gonna do the same
thing with the bonus action.

01:13:51.570 --> 01:13:54.660
That is 26.

01:13:54.690 --> 01:13:56.690
MATT: Twenty-six to
hit, that hits.

01:13:56.720 --> 01:14:07.240
♪

01:14:07.270 --> 01:14:10.330
LIAM: Ten plus four,
psychic damage 14.

01:14:10.360 --> 01:14:12.360
MATT: Fourteen points of damage.

01:14:12.390 --> 01:14:13.870
Okay, so you go
for the tongue

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.180
and you get the
blade up to the mouth.

01:14:16.210 --> 01:14:19.120
Suddenly, her looking down 
and having a very,

01:14:19.150 --> 01:14:21.600
very wide view of the entire
battlefield is very advantageous

01:14:21.630 --> 01:14:22.750
from her perspective.

01:14:22.780 --> 01:14:24.420
She sees you out of the
corner of her eye,

01:14:24.450 --> 01:14:26.150
she turns to try
and snap at you,

01:14:26.180 --> 01:14:28.390
and the jaws come down
and catch the blade.

01:14:28.420 --> 01:14:30.000
So, it doesn't
go for the tongue,

01:14:30.030 --> 01:14:32.750
but you use that momentum to
glide it up the actual tooth

01:14:32.780 --> 01:14:34.270
and jam it into the gum.

01:14:34.300 --> 01:14:36.240
You manage to slam up there

01:14:36.270 --> 01:14:37.660
and the blood spurts
out from the wound and--

01:14:37.690 --> 01:14:38.840
(snarls)

01:14:38.870 --> 01:14:41.090
Rears back and so now
you're kind of flying up

01:14:41.120 --> 01:14:42.330
by her face now.

01:14:42.360 --> 01:14:44.570
LIAM: I should have like
10 or 15 movement left

01:14:44.600 --> 01:14:46.030
with 60 for wings, yeah?

01:14:46.060 --> 01:14:49.510
If I was 15 feet up and she
was a little less than 70?

01:14:49.540 --> 01:14:51.480
MATT: Fifteen feet up, yes, but
you're also coming at an angle,

01:14:51.510 --> 01:14:54.000
which, you lose
distance on that.

01:14:54.030 --> 01:14:55.240
LIAM: So am I at zero?

01:14:55.270 --> 01:14:56.360
MATT: You're pretty
much at zero, yeah.

01:14:56.390 --> 01:14:58.030
LAURA: Ooh, like right
in front of her face.

01:14:58.060 --> 01:15:00.270
-TRAVIS: Just stay there like Tinkerbell.

01:15:00.300 --> 01:15:02.810
LIAM: Okay. All done.

01:15:03.630 --> 01:15:07.300
MATT: That ends your turn.

01:15:07.800 --> 01:15:09.150
TRAVIS: You are grounded.

01:15:09.180 --> 01:15:10.480
MATT: At the end of your turn,

01:15:10.510 --> 01:15:13.120
she's going to use
another legendary action.

01:15:13.150 --> 01:15:15.240
To do a tail
attack against you.

01:15:16.450 --> 01:15:19.840
She pulls part of
her torso out for a moment,

01:15:19.870 --> 01:15:22.030
and her tail whips
out in your direction

01:15:22.060 --> 01:15:23.780
to try and slam into you.

01:15:23.810 --> 01:15:28.000
That is a 19 plus,
what is it, 32.

01:15:28.030 --> 01:15:30.690
LIAM: Don't think that
hits actually.

01:15:30.720 --> 01:15:32.780
So I'll use
Uncanny Dodge.

01:15:37.300 --> 01:15:39.810
MATT: That's gonna be 24 points
of bludgeoning damage

01:15:39.840 --> 01:15:43.090
reduced to 12,
so there you go.

01:15:43.120 --> 01:15:45.660
Alright, that brings
us to Kima's turn.

01:15:45.690 --> 01:15:47.210
Kima finally arrives.

01:15:47.240 --> 01:15:49.630
-MARISHA: Kima!
-SAM: Hey!

01:15:49.660 --> 01:15:51.870
TRAVIS: Slow poke!

01:15:51.870 --> 01:15:53.660
MATT: "Seriously?"

01:15:53.690 --> 01:15:56.660
That's her turn.

01:15:56.690 --> 01:16:00.070
TRAVIS: That Holy Avenger's
real heavy.

01:16:01.570 --> 01:16:04.660
MATT: So that brings us to Pike.

01:16:04.690 --> 01:16:07.560
Actually, no at the
end of Kima's turn,

01:16:08.150 --> 01:16:09.750
let's see here.

01:16:09.780 --> 01:16:11.670
Raishan's gonna use
another legendary action

01:16:11.670 --> 01:16:13.420
to attempt another
tail attack against you,

01:16:13.420 --> 01:16:15.190
since you're
within range.

01:16:15.190 --> 01:16:17.150
-That is a...
-LIAM: 10,000.

01:16:17.180 --> 01:16:19.600
MATT: Twenty-one to hit.

01:16:22.360 --> 01:16:24.130
-LIAM: Shit, it just hits.
-MATT: Just hits?

01:16:24.130 --> 01:16:25.370
Okay.

01:16:29.660 --> 01:16:32.510
Seventeen points of
bludgeoning damage.

01:16:32.540 --> 01:16:35.360
Yeah, go and halve that.

01:16:35.390 --> 01:16:38.360
She's used all of her legendary actions
for this round.

01:16:38.390 --> 01:16:39.360
Okay.

01:16:39.390 --> 01:16:41.040
TRAVIS: All legendary-- did you hear that?

01:16:41.040 --> 01:16:42.030
MATT: Pike.

01:16:42.060 --> 01:16:43.780
-TRAVIS: Pike's up.
-LAURA: Okay.

01:16:43.810 --> 01:16:45.890
I think we
should do...

01:16:48.210 --> 01:16:50.600
But okay, if she
does Flame Strike

01:16:50.630 --> 01:16:52.630
can she focus it
on the ceiling?

01:16:52.660 --> 01:16:54.360
Or does it have
to be on the ground?

01:16:54.390 --> 01:16:57.000
MATT: No, it can-- I'd say--

01:16:57.030 --> 01:16:59.700
let me pull it up
real fast here.

01:16:59.700 --> 01:17:01.130
It roars down from the
Heavens in all locations,

01:17:01.130 --> 01:17:02.690
so it doesn't come
out of the floor,

01:17:02.720 --> 01:17:03.690
it comes out of the
ceiling, so yeah.

01:17:03.720 --> 01:17:05.000
LAURA: Okay.

01:17:05.030 --> 01:17:06.660
So, it's her
level five spell.

01:17:06.690 --> 01:17:08.750
-LIAM: Okay, aim it at--
-LAURA: At Raishan?

01:17:08.780 --> 01:17:11.150
At Raishan's butt,
not at Vax.

01:17:12.150 --> 01:17:13.720
MATT: Raishan currently,
only visible,

01:17:13.750 --> 01:17:17.300
is about maybe
10 feet or so of--

01:17:17.330 --> 01:17:18.720
actually pulling
out the tail attack,

01:17:18.750 --> 01:17:21.240
I'd say about 15 feet.

01:17:21.270 --> 01:17:23.150
So if she's careful, yeah,

01:17:23.180 --> 01:17:25.030
she could probably hit
Raishan and not hit Vax.

01:17:25.060 --> 01:17:27.510
-LAURA: Pike is always careful.
-TRAVIS: So careful.

01:17:27.540 --> 01:17:28.570
LAURA: She's the carefulest.

01:17:28.600 --> 01:17:31.270
MATT: Fair enough.

01:17:31.300 --> 01:17:33.540
LAURA: Okay.

01:17:33.570 --> 01:17:35.690
So, wow, that's
a really big--

01:17:35.720 --> 01:17:37.570
Sixty feet, damn.

01:17:37.600 --> 01:17:38.840
TRAVIS: That's good shit.

01:17:38.870 --> 01:17:43.690
LAURA: So, that's 4d6
plus 4d6 radiant.

01:17:47.600 --> 01:17:49.470
MATT: It's gonna be close.

01:17:51.690 --> 01:17:55.390
Yeah, roughly about
55 feet up on the ceiling.

01:17:55.420 --> 01:17:56.720
With that 60 foot range,

01:17:56.750 --> 01:17:58.690
she can just hit Raishan
with the column, so yeah.

01:17:58.720 --> 01:18:01.030
-LAURA: Okay.
-MATT: So that is 8d6 damage.

01:18:01.060 --> 01:18:02.420
LAURA: Okay, wow.

01:18:02.450 --> 01:18:03.940
MATT: Go ahead
and roll that.

01:18:03.940 --> 01:18:05.330
Raishan makes a save--

01:18:05.360 --> 01:18:07.510
LAURA: I roll five and
you roll three.

01:18:07.540 --> 01:18:08.750
MATT: So a dexterity
saving throw.

01:18:08.780 --> 01:18:10.000
LAURA: Oh, just kidding.

01:18:10.030 --> 01:18:12.270
MATT: Twenty-seven, I'm
pretty sure that saves.

01:18:12.300 --> 01:18:14.030
LAURA: No, I want
to roll some.

01:18:14.060 --> 01:18:16.540
I roll, I'll roll three.

01:18:16.570 --> 01:18:17.750
You roll five.

01:18:17.780 --> 01:18:22.720
♪

01:18:22.720 --> 01:18:24.280
-LIAM: Eighteen.
-LAURA: Thirteen.

01:18:24.280 --> 01:18:26.620
MATT: And also makes a
concentration check from your attack earlier.

01:18:26.620 --> 01:18:27.780
LAURA: Thirty-five.

01:18:27.810 --> 01:18:29.450
-SAM: No.
-LAURA: No.

01:18:29.480 --> 01:18:31.510
-SAM: Thirty-one.
-LAURA: Thirty-one.

01:18:31.540 --> 01:18:32.660
-MATT: Thirty-one?
-LIAM: Yeah.

01:18:32.690 --> 01:18:34.180
MATT: So half
that to 15.

01:18:34.210 --> 01:18:35.210
Fifteen points
of damage.

01:18:35.240 --> 01:18:36.540
MARISHA: Benefit of the doubt.

01:18:36.570 --> 01:18:37.690
MATT: Alright, cool, got it.

01:18:37.720 --> 01:18:39.240
LAURA: Why half?

01:18:39.270 --> 01:18:41.030
TALIESIN: She made her
saving throw.

01:18:41.060 --> 01:18:42.810
TRAVIS: At 27.

01:18:42.840 --> 01:18:44.840
MATT: Sorry.

01:18:44.870 --> 01:18:46.720
So, you just barely
move out of the way

01:18:46.750 --> 01:18:48.690
as you watch a familiar
gathering of radiant energy

01:18:48.720 --> 01:18:50.300
up in the ceiling.

01:18:50.330 --> 01:18:51.720
You see the glimmer
in the corner

01:18:51.750 --> 01:18:53.510
of Raishan's
slick eyeballs

01:18:53.540 --> 01:18:56.600
recessed within the
green armor-plated face.

01:18:56.630 --> 01:18:58.810
of the dragon as
all of a sudden--

01:18:58.840 --> 01:19:01.060
A great column of fire
and radiant energy

01:19:01.090 --> 01:19:04.210
blasts Raishan in
the side of the face.

01:19:05.180 --> 01:19:08.330
LAURA: And she's gonna back
up towards the opening

01:19:08.360 --> 01:19:10.600
towards the
entrance a bit.

01:19:10.630 --> 01:19:12.270
-Yeah, like right there.
-MATT: Right there?

01:19:12.300 --> 01:19:14.450
That's as far as
she can get right there.

01:19:14.480 --> 01:19:16.150
Cool.

01:19:16.180 --> 01:19:18.540
SAM: Does she have
a bonus action?

01:19:18.570 --> 01:19:20.690
LAURA: She's got a
bonus action.

01:19:20.720 --> 01:19:22.090
-SAM: Heal herself?
-MARISHA: Is it Healing Word?

01:19:22.120 --> 01:19:23.540
LAURA: Oh, yeah,
she can, right?

01:19:23.570 --> 01:19:26.870
'Cause she can use
a level two or less.

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.540
So, yeah,
she'll do a level--

01:19:29.570 --> 01:19:31.780
she doesn't have
any level two's left.

01:19:31.810 --> 01:19:34.570
She'll do a level one
Healing Word on herself.

01:19:34.600 --> 01:19:35.840
MATT: Okay.

01:19:35.870 --> 01:19:37.570
LAURA: Oh, God, she's
at five hit points.

01:19:37.600 --> 01:19:38.750
-SAM: Yeah, I know.
-TALIESIN: Not anymore.

01:19:38.780 --> 01:19:40.630
LAURA: She's--she's
Pike though.

01:19:40.660 --> 01:19:42.060
This is what
she would have done.

01:19:42.090 --> 01:19:44.270
-TALIESIN: She's now at--
-LAURA: I think.

01:19:44.300 --> 01:19:47.060
TALIESIN: What does the
level one Healing Word do?

01:19:47.090 --> 01:19:49.210
SAM: It's 1d4 plus five
or something like that.

01:19:49.240 --> 01:19:51.600
MARISHA: It does an
additional d4.

01:19:51.630 --> 01:19:53.270
LAURA: Oh.

01:19:53.300 --> 01:19:55.060
MARISHA: Right?

01:19:55.090 --> 01:19:56.510
No, sorry,
just one d4.

01:19:56.540 --> 01:20:00.780
LAURA: One d4 plus five,
so yeah, seven.

01:20:00.810 --> 01:20:02.360
TALIESIN: So, she's at
12 hit points now.

01:20:02.390 --> 01:20:04.510
-SAM: Double dig!
-LAURA: Yeah.

01:20:04.540 --> 01:20:07.120
TALIESIN: That's better.

01:20:07.150 --> 01:20:09.360
-MARISHA: Double dig!
-TALIESIN: That's--

01:20:13.690 --> 01:20:15.840
SAM: What's that look, Matt?

01:20:15.870 --> 01:20:18.240
TRAVIS: Seven points of
healing, so yeah.

01:20:18.270 --> 01:20:20.570
MATT: Cool, does that
end your turn?

01:20:20.600 --> 01:20:21.720
-TRAVIS: Yep.
-LIAM: Yep.

01:20:21.750 --> 01:20:23.570
MATT: Good, Scanlan, you're up.

01:20:23.600 --> 01:20:24.960
SAM: Okay.

01:20:26.510 --> 01:20:29.510
I don't know, man,
this looks rough in here.

01:20:29.540 --> 01:20:31.450
I don't want
to be in here.

01:20:31.480 --> 01:20:34.090
(laughing)

01:20:34.120 --> 01:20:36.730
I'll move forward
and to the left a bit.

01:20:36.730 --> 01:20:39.080
MATT: That's about as
far as you can go.

01:20:39.080 --> 01:20:40.510
SAM: Sorry, to my right.

01:20:40.540 --> 01:20:45.510
To the right,
four to the right.

01:20:45.540 --> 01:20:47.060
Oh, man.

01:20:47.090 --> 01:20:48.840
It's a rough fight.

01:20:48.840 --> 01:20:50.690
But we're winning,
right, now, guys?

01:20:50.720 --> 01:20:52.780
We're winning, we don't
need any help, do we?

01:20:52.810 --> 01:20:54.120
LAURA: (gasps)

01:20:54.150 --> 01:20:55.210
LIAM: Did you forget?

01:20:55.240 --> 01:20:57.270
LAURA: I totally forgot!

01:20:57.300 --> 01:20:59.210
MARISHA: How could you forget?

01:20:59.240 --> 01:21:00.780
It's like all
I've thought about.

01:21:00.780 --> 01:21:02.360
TRAVIS: I will cuddle you,
I will cuddle.

01:21:02.390 --> 01:21:03.660
LAURA: I even wrote--

01:21:03.690 --> 01:21:05.030
TALIESIN: He's not gonna do it
until Ashley's dead.

01:21:05.060 --> 01:21:06.180
LAURA: I wrote a limerick.

01:21:06.210 --> 01:21:07.210
MARISHA: Ashley is almost--

01:21:07.240 --> 01:21:08.690
-SAM: You wrote a limerick?
-LAURA: For you.

01:21:08.720 --> 01:21:11.300
SAM: For me? To do what?

01:21:11.330 --> 01:21:14.000
LAURA: Wait, wait,
I forgot I did it.

01:21:14.030 --> 01:21:16.270
"Have you heard tale
of Scanlan, the bold?

01:21:16.300 --> 01:21:18.630
He won't tell us his age,
but he's old.

01:21:18.660 --> 01:21:20.300
With his blade,
he's a slayer,

01:21:20.330 --> 01:21:21.840
with the ladies,
a player,

01:21:21.870 --> 01:21:24.660
but if he picks up the
flute, he's pure gold."

01:21:24.690 --> 01:21:26.180
MARISHA: Hey!

01:21:26.210 --> 01:21:28.060
(applause, laughing)

01:21:31.390 --> 01:21:33.080
SAM: Alright, so I'm gonna
do Lightning Bolt.

01:21:33.080 --> 01:21:34.110
LAURA: Goddammit!

01:21:34.110 --> 01:21:35.900
(laughter)

01:21:45.300 --> 01:21:49.540
SAM: I will-- I assume that
Scanlan feels strange

01:21:49.570 --> 01:21:51.720
with a brass flute
touching his lips,

01:21:51.750 --> 01:21:53.620
because he's never
played one before.

01:21:53.620 --> 01:21:55.330
MATT: This is true.

01:21:55.360 --> 01:21:58.660
SAM: But does it still come out just
as beautiful and pure as always?

01:21:58.690 --> 01:21:59.720
MATT: Roll a performance check.

01:21:59.750 --> 01:22:03.300
SAM: Okay.

01:22:03.330 --> 01:22:06.390
LAURA: I'm so nervous,
I'm about to cry.

01:22:06.420 --> 01:22:09.330
-SAM: Thirty.
-MARISHA: Oh!

01:22:09.360 --> 01:22:13.270
MATT: In the midst of this chaos,
the rumbling of the room,

01:22:13.300 --> 01:22:17.060
the sound of the lightning
and thunder in the clouds,

01:22:17.090 --> 01:22:21.000
the falling of rock and
soot from the ceiling

01:22:21.030 --> 01:22:22.540
is drowned out by
what sounds like

01:22:22.570 --> 01:22:25.240
the most beautiful
clear flute.

01:22:25.270 --> 01:22:26.390
It just trills...

01:22:26.420 --> 01:22:28.690
(whistling)

01:22:28.720 --> 01:22:30.210
SAM: ♪ Call the dragon ♪

01:22:30.210 --> 01:22:33.360
(all humming)

01:22:33.390 --> 01:22:34.810
♪ Call the dragon ♪♪

01:22:34.840 --> 01:22:37.480
MATT: You finish the song
as you watch the brass glow.

01:22:37.480 --> 01:22:39.720
It begins to
kinda give this--

01:22:39.750 --> 01:22:43.030
this weird shine around
it that begins to emanate

01:22:43.060 --> 01:22:47.420
this kind of
additional warmth

01:22:47.450 --> 01:22:49.450
and light from it
and then it dulls

01:22:49.480 --> 01:22:52.030
and the brass
goes to a very tarnished

01:22:52.060 --> 01:22:54.270
dark metal material.

01:22:54.300 --> 01:22:55.690
TALIESIN: It's Amazon Prime.

01:22:55.720 --> 01:22:58.300
It's gonna take three days
but it's gonna be here.

01:22:58.330 --> 01:23:01.040
SAM: I've played better.

01:23:01.840 --> 01:23:05.690
MATT: You watch the flute ping
in the hallway behind him.

01:23:05.720 --> 01:23:08.300
-So that's your action.
-SAM: Okay.

01:23:08.330 --> 01:23:10.660
As a bonus, I will--

01:23:10.690 --> 01:23:12.720
Boy, everyone's
dying, right?

01:23:12.750 --> 01:23:14.700
TALIESIN: Yeah.

01:23:15.150 --> 01:23:18.360
SAM: Pike's near me, so I'll turn

01:23:18.390 --> 01:23:21.810
and give her a
level two Healing Word.

01:23:21.840 --> 01:23:24.210
-MATT: Okay.
-SAM: As well.

01:23:24.240 --> 01:23:26.080
And I will sing to her:

01:23:28.240 --> 01:23:30.210
♪ I've got Mythcarver
in my pocket ♪

01:23:30.240 --> 01:23:32.450

01:23:48.780 --> 01:23:49.780
MATT: Alrighty.

01:23:49.780 --> 01:23:51.840
MATT: Pike takes her inspiration die.

01:23:51.840 --> 01:23:53.840
SAM: Uh, no, not inspiration,
healing, healing.

01:23:53.840 --> 01:23:55.690
So, wait, I got
to roll or she rolls?

01:23:55.720 --> 01:23:56.840
MATT: You roll for her.

01:23:56.870 --> 01:23:58.510
SAM: Okay, ooh.

01:23:58.540 --> 01:23:59.600
Oh, boy.

01:23:59.630 --> 01:24:01.450
(groaning)

01:24:01.480 --> 01:24:02.840
(laughter)

01:24:02.870 --> 01:24:04.810
-SAM: Eight.
-MATT: She heals eight points.

01:24:04.840 --> 01:24:07.450
SAM: She's up to 20!

01:24:07.480 --> 01:24:10.390
-TALIESIN: She can almost drink.
-MARISHA: She can drink next year.

01:24:10.420 --> 01:24:12.660
MATT: Alrighty, ending Scanlan's turn,
brings us to the top.

01:24:12.690 --> 01:24:14.270
Percival, your turn.

01:24:14.300 --> 01:24:17.120
TALIESIN: Okay, I'm going to...

01:24:18.150 --> 01:24:20.420
Yeah, this is fine.

01:24:20.450 --> 01:24:22.060
SAM: ♪ Can't stop ♪♪

01:24:22.090 --> 01:24:24.810
TALIESIN: I'm going to--
this is fine.

01:24:24.840 --> 01:24:28.120
I'm going to take
some shots with Animus

01:24:28.150 --> 01:24:32.330
at that awful bastard at the
top of the cave.

01:24:32.360 --> 01:24:34.690
First shot, and I'm not making
it a sharpshooter shot,

01:24:34.720 --> 01:24:38.240
I'm just shooting.

01:24:38.270 --> 01:24:39.360
That's good too.

01:24:39.390 --> 01:24:42.090
Oh, that's not bad, 24.

01:24:42.120 --> 01:24:43.090
MATT: 24 hits.

01:24:43.120 --> 01:24:44.730
TALIESIN: Alright.

01:24:46.660 --> 01:24:50.000
LAURA: Look at all those pots
of gold in the corners.

01:24:50.030 --> 01:24:52.810
TALIESIN: That's 13 points plus five
points of psychic damage.

01:24:52.840 --> 01:24:55.570
MATT: Okay.

01:24:55.600 --> 01:24:57.480
TALIESIN: And another shot.

01:24:57.510 --> 01:24:59.570
TRAVIS: Shot.

01:24:59.600 --> 01:25:02.600
TALIESIN: And that's, uh, that's--

01:25:04.420 --> 01:25:05.630
Oh, that's not bad.

01:25:05.660 --> 01:25:07.810
That's two points of
psychic damage to me.

01:25:07.810 --> 01:25:09.020
MATT: Oh, buddy!

01:25:11.210 --> 01:25:14.180
-SAM: He's already unhinged.
-TALIESIN: So that's 54.

01:25:14.210 --> 01:25:17.300
So, that was like
thankfully, just an ow!

01:25:17.330 --> 01:25:18.660
I'm just putting it away.

01:25:18.690 --> 01:25:20.210
I'm just gonna
try and pull--

01:25:20.240 --> 01:25:22.180
pull out the big gun and take
one last shot while I'm--

01:25:22.210 --> 01:25:23.390
while I'm--
well, actually, no,

01:25:23.420 --> 01:25:24.570
that knocks out my
attacks, doesn't it?

01:25:24.600 --> 01:25:26.330
Cause it's a
psychic damage.

01:25:26.360 --> 01:25:27.660
MATT: Well, I was gonna say,

01:25:27.690 --> 01:25:29.690
the psychic damage doesn't
negate your attacks.

01:25:29.720 --> 01:25:32.270
TALIESIN: I don't have time
to switch guns.

01:25:32.300 --> 01:25:34.840
No, cause the psychic damage
knocks that out if I recall.

01:25:34.870 --> 01:25:36.840
MATT: No, psychic damage
doesn't affect the way--

01:25:36.870 --> 01:25:38.300
TALIESIN: So, do I have
time to just try

01:25:38.330 --> 01:25:39.720
and get one more
potshot out or am I--

01:25:39.750 --> 01:25:41.090
MATT: Was Bad News prepared?

01:25:41.120 --> 01:25:42.120
TALIESIN: It was fine, it
was working fine.

01:25:42.150 --> 01:25:43.600
-MATT: It was fine.
-TALIESIN: Yeah.

01:25:43.630 --> 01:25:44.860
Nothing's broke,
well, now...

01:25:44.860 --> 01:25:46.140
MATT: Now it is, yeah.

01:25:46.140 --> 01:25:48.400
TALIESIN: Now that's broken, okay.

01:25:49.060 --> 01:25:50.840
So, and now Bad News,
here we go.

01:25:50.870 --> 01:25:52.840
LIAM: Come on, Golden Snitch!

01:25:52.870 --> 01:25:53.500
Do it!

01:25:55.330 --> 01:25:56.330
TALIESIN: Natural 20!

01:25:56.360 --> 01:25:59.180
-LAURA: Yes!
-TRAVIS: On cue!

01:25:59.210 --> 01:26:01.360
(cheering)

01:26:01.390 --> 01:26:02.840
TALIESIN: Thank you, baby.

01:26:02.870 --> 01:26:03.630
Okay.

01:26:06.810 --> 01:26:08.090
MATT: So, that'll hit.

01:26:08.120 --> 01:26:10.750
TALIESIN: Yeah, let's--
let's take--

01:26:10.780 --> 01:26:11.840
Let's take--

01:26:11.870 --> 01:26:13.300
SAM: Weird critical
things here?

01:26:13.330 --> 01:26:14.570
TALIESIN: I don't do any
weird critical thing

01:26:14.600 --> 01:26:16.150
other than doing
a lot of damage.

01:26:16.180 --> 01:26:17.420
MATT: Correct.

01:26:17.450 --> 01:26:19.540
TALIESIN: Although, where's my--
I do have, okay, so--

01:26:19.570 --> 01:26:21.240
That does a
lot of damage.

01:26:21.240 --> 01:26:22.390
(talking over each other)

01:26:22.420 --> 01:26:24.330
-MARISHA: Amazing.
-TALIESIN: Double dice.

01:26:24.360 --> 01:26:25.360
TRAVIS: Come on,
you deranged--

01:26:25.390 --> 01:26:26.360
LIAM: Find one thing
and do it well.

01:26:26.390 --> 01:26:28.590
TALIESIN: Not bad, okay, that's--

01:26:31.270 --> 01:26:32.540
31 points of damage.

01:26:32.570 --> 01:26:35.180
-MATT: Alright.
-TALIESIN: That'll do.

01:26:35.210 --> 01:26:37.180
MATT: Very nice.

01:26:37.210 --> 01:26:39.800
TALIESIN: Yeah, it's 4d12,
plus six, so.

01:26:41.090 --> 01:26:43.540
And now I'm gonna hide
behind that dragon egg.

01:26:43.570 --> 01:26:46.660
MATT: Alright, so you move behind
the dragon egg right there.

01:26:46.660 --> 01:26:47.810
TALIESIN: Yep.

01:26:47.840 --> 01:26:50.330
Oh, and that means I get
a grit point back ah-ha!

01:26:50.360 --> 01:26:53.330
I can actually do
a thing, that's good.

01:26:53.360 --> 01:26:55.000
Okay, alrighty.

01:26:55.030 --> 01:26:57.000
SAM: So, things are turning around
ever since that limerick.

01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:58.600
LIAM: Watch this, I'm gonna
get turned

01:26:58.630 --> 01:27:00.060
into pulled pork right now.

01:27:00.090 --> 01:27:02.420
MATT: Well, it's the
lair actions now.

01:27:02.450 --> 01:27:04.480
So in this one...

01:27:04.510 --> 01:27:06.810
TALIESIN: The Earth itself
turns against us.

01:27:06.840 --> 01:27:08.060
(rumbles)

01:27:08.090 --> 01:27:09.850
MATT: From beneath
your feet, Grog,

01:27:09.850 --> 01:27:13.420
you feel and you look down
just as the rock splits

01:27:13.450 --> 01:27:16.050
and a spray of--
a tiny geyser of molten rock

01:27:16.050 --> 01:27:17.360
just sprays outward.

01:27:17.360 --> 01:27:19.270
You try and move out
of the way in time,

01:27:19.300 --> 01:27:22.650
but sprays across you,
Pike, Scanlan and Vex.

01:27:22.650 --> 01:27:25.340
So I need you guys all to make
dexterity saving throws.

01:27:25.340 --> 01:27:27.390
LAURA: You want to
make it for me?

01:27:29.980 --> 01:27:31.870
SAM: Natural 20, 25.

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:34.180
MATT: Whoo! That'll do.

01:27:34.210 --> 01:27:36.480
TALIESIN: There's nothing
natural about 25.

01:27:36.510 --> 01:27:39.690
Purely artificial, you've
had work done on that 20.

01:27:39.720 --> 01:27:42.020
-SAM: This is LA.
-TALIESIN: This is LA.

01:27:42.650 --> 01:27:44.810
MARISHA: Lot of LA things
right back to back.

01:27:44.810 --> 01:27:45.866
-It's overwhelming.
-TALIESIN: Man.

01:27:45.866 --> 01:27:46.923
TRAVIS: 21.

01:27:46.923 --> 01:27:47.980
-MATT: 21? Succeeds.
-LAURA: Twenty.

01:27:47.980 --> 01:27:49.270
MATT: Succeeds, Pike?

01:27:49.300 --> 01:27:50.630
LIAM: Eleven for Pike.

01:27:50.660 --> 01:27:52.130
MATT: Pike does
not succeed.

01:27:52.130 --> 01:27:53.120
SAM: 20, 25.

01:27:53.150 --> 01:27:55.870
MATT: Succeed, alright, so, you
guys who all succeeded,

01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:58.870
you take 12 points
of fire damage.

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:02.060
Half of you
are resistant.

01:28:02.090 --> 01:28:04.630
-SAM: So six.
-MATT: Just six.

01:28:04.660 --> 01:28:06.450
Pike takes 12 points
of fire damage

01:28:06.480 --> 01:28:08.510
because she's resistant even
though she failed her save.

01:28:08.540 --> 01:28:09.540
-LAURA: Okay.
-MARISHA: Oh, that's good.

01:28:09.570 --> 01:28:10.540
That's good.

01:28:10.570 --> 01:28:11.870
LAURA: So she's still up.

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:13.420
-SAM: She's still alive!
-TALIESIN: She's still alive.

01:28:13.450 --> 01:28:16.210
SAM: Because of me, let's just
go on record and say that.

01:28:16.240 --> 01:28:18.600
TALIESIN: I'll go with that.

01:28:18.630 --> 01:28:20.240
LIAM: Can you say
it in Spanish?

01:28:20.270 --> 01:28:22.780
SAM: No, I cannot.

01:28:22.810 --> 01:28:25.660
-TALIESIN: Pike.
-SAM: Yo no soy Marinado.

01:28:32.750 --> 01:28:35.060
Alright, that brings us
back to Raishan's turn.

01:28:35.090 --> 01:28:36.360
LAURA: Oh God, oh God.

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:41.420
MATT: Gets her legendary
actions back.

01:28:41.450 --> 01:28:43.520
TRAVIS: It's cool,
you can just go.

01:28:46.090 --> 01:28:48.600
MATT: Given the current
circumstance...

01:28:48.630 --> 01:28:51.030
TALIESIN: No.

01:28:51.060 --> 01:28:52.660
No.

01:28:52.690 --> 01:28:55.870
MATT: Raishan is going
to unleash...

01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:58.360
TRAVIS: Handshake?

01:28:58.390 --> 01:29:01.120
MATT: She's going to unleash a full
round of attacks against you

01:29:01.150 --> 01:29:04.570
as you are right up in her face
and stabbed her in the gums

01:29:04.600 --> 01:29:08.330
and avoided the entirety
of her meteor swarm

01:29:08.360 --> 01:29:11.300
and you also
attacked her.

01:29:11.300 --> 01:29:13.470
TALIESIN: In defense, she had
some corn stuck in her--

01:29:13.470 --> 01:29:15.090
LAURA: Yeah, he really
was helping.

01:29:15.120 --> 01:29:16.660
It'd been there for like--

01:29:16.690 --> 01:29:18.200
MATT: And she appreciates that,

01:29:18.200 --> 01:29:20.630
but the rest of the
stuff is still a problem.

01:29:20.630 --> 01:29:22.600
TALIESIN: I'm trying not
to say anything.

01:29:22.630 --> 01:29:24.540
MATT: That is 22 to
hit with a bite.

01:29:24.570 --> 01:29:26.420
LIAM: That just hits,
Uncanny Dodge.

01:29:26.450 --> 01:29:30.750
SAM: Maybe you should remind
her that we have a deal.

01:29:30.780 --> 01:29:33.270
We're supposed to
be working together.

01:29:33.300 --> 01:29:35.180
MATT: 22, well,
yeah, so they all hit.

01:29:35.180 --> 01:29:37.070
SAM: What happened to
our deal, Raishan?

01:29:37.070 --> 01:29:39.680
LIAM: The first one is Uncanny
and then the rest are--

01:29:39.680 --> 01:29:42.360
MATT: Correct, so the
bite attack is halved.

01:29:42.390 --> 01:29:44.780
Which is good.

01:29:44.810 --> 01:29:48.330
That'll be 22 points
of piercing damage

01:29:49.210 --> 01:29:52.750
and you got the warm
tingle earlier, right?

01:29:52.780 --> 01:29:56.400
You also suffer
ten points

01:29:56.400 --> 01:29:58.140
of poison damage.

01:29:58.140 --> 01:29:59.380
SAM: Ten points of poison?

01:29:59.380 --> 01:30:00.880
LAURA: Even though he's
immune to poison?

01:30:00.880 --> 01:30:02.390
MATT: He's not immune to poison.

01:30:02.420 --> 01:30:04.330
-LAURA: He's not?
-MATT: No.

01:30:04.360 --> 01:30:06.860
LIAM: Not from that-- so that
our Hero's Feast does nothing.

01:30:06.860 --> 01:30:09.240
LAURA: It was Dispel, she dispelled
our Heroes' Feast.

01:30:09.270 --> 01:30:10.780
That's what that
fucking shit was.

01:30:10.810 --> 01:30:14.090
-TRAVIS: Oh!
-LIAM: Is that the total--

01:30:14.120 --> 01:30:15.600
MATT: That was the bite attack.

01:30:15.630 --> 01:30:17.840
So that whole
attack is halved.

01:30:17.870 --> 01:30:21.550
The poison damage and the
piercing you took is halved.

01:30:22.810 --> 01:30:24.770
The claw attack...

01:30:28.300 --> 01:30:31.010
SAM: There was a shimmering and
you didn't feel anything.

01:30:31.010 --> 01:30:32.810
MATT: 26 points of piercing damage.

01:30:32.840 --> 01:30:34.000
LIAM: Vax is falling.

01:30:34.030 --> 01:30:35.030
(gasps)

01:30:35.060 --> 01:30:36.300
SAM: Oh, no.

01:30:36.330 --> 01:30:39.000
MATT: And the tail bats
you on the way down.

01:30:39.030 --> 01:30:42.420
You guys watch as the
darkened wings of Vax go limp

01:30:42.450 --> 01:30:44.420
and he just plummets.

01:30:47.660 --> 01:30:49.270
MARISHA: Oh, boy.

01:30:49.300 --> 01:30:53.030
SAM: That's gonna be--

01:30:53.060 --> 01:30:54.450
MATT: Roll a d20.

01:30:54.480 --> 01:30:56.060
LAURA: Oh, God.

01:30:56.090 --> 01:30:57.720
LIAM: Is this a death save?

01:30:57.750 --> 01:31:01.090
MATT: No, this is a trajectory.

01:31:01.120 --> 01:31:03.660
MARISHA: Oh my God, please
don't land in the lava.

01:31:03.690 --> 01:31:05.780
MATT: You smack right
into the edge,

01:31:05.810 --> 01:31:08.570
but not into
the magma river.

01:31:11.150 --> 01:31:15.060
You hear the cracking sound
of bones breaking upon impact

01:31:15.090 --> 01:31:17.510
and the wings
themselves broken.

01:31:17.540 --> 01:31:21.870
Feathers falling and burning
within the molten rock.

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:23.690
The wings slowly
fold in and curl

01:31:23.720 --> 01:31:26.270
like a spider
dying and vanish.

01:31:27.300 --> 01:31:28.720
LIAM: That sucks.

01:31:28.750 --> 01:31:30.390
SAM: Forever?

01:31:30.420 --> 01:31:33.090
LAURA: No, not forever!

01:31:33.120 --> 01:31:34.840
TALIESIN: He just went unconscious.

01:31:34.870 --> 01:31:36.720
MATT: And with that...

01:31:36.750 --> 01:31:38.630
TALIESIN: Something's gotta
be done about that.

01:31:38.660 --> 01:31:41.090
TRAVIS: You are Anakin
on the riverbed.

01:31:41.120 --> 01:31:42.480
MARISHA: Totally.

01:31:42.510 --> 01:31:46.870
TALIESIN: Magma is practically like your
arch nemesis to be fair.

01:31:46.870 --> 01:31:48.450
LIAM: I don't-- I don't know.

01:31:48.480 --> 01:31:51.280
MATT: Raishan is going to move.

01:31:51.280 --> 01:31:52.120
(pieces crash)

01:31:52.120 --> 01:31:53.150
(shouts)

01:31:53.180 --> 01:31:54.870
MATT: Kima, no!

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:58.390
-MARISHA: Poor Kima!
-SAM: Bye.

01:31:58.420 --> 01:32:00.420
I just got here!

01:32:00.450 --> 01:32:02.630
(indistinct talking)

01:32:10.270 --> 01:32:12.540
MATT: Alrighty.

01:32:12.570 --> 01:32:16.450
And as she emerges now, after
knocking you out of the air,

01:32:16.480 --> 01:32:18.510
wings fully out, Raishan...

01:32:18.540 --> 01:32:21.030
(snarling)

01:32:21.060 --> 01:32:23.210
"You're next."

01:32:23.240 --> 01:32:25.180
And then swoops over
and is now floating

01:32:25.210 --> 01:32:27.810
over the lava pool
over that way.

01:32:27.840 --> 01:32:29.870
And appears to be
preparing for something.

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:32.180
LIAM: Have I got any automatic
fails in a death save?

01:32:32.210 --> 01:32:34.480
MATT: Yes, you did fail a death saving
throw from hitting the ground.

01:32:34.510 --> 01:32:36.440
-LIAM: Hitting the ground?
-MATT: Yes.

01:32:36.440 --> 01:32:39.060
SAM: As she does that, I yell out,
"Could you be more specific?

01:32:39.090 --> 01:32:41.270
Who is next, who?

01:32:41.300 --> 01:32:44.000
Oh, we didn't see who you
were looking at over here.

01:32:44.030 --> 01:32:45.120
No?

01:32:45.150 --> 01:32:49.270
Alright, guess
we'll find out."

01:32:49.300 --> 01:32:51.270
TRAVIS: I was so preoccupied,
I missed it.

01:32:51.300 --> 01:32:52.830
MATT: That ends Raishan's turn.

01:32:52.830 --> 01:32:55.810
Keyleth, you're up.

01:32:55.840 --> 01:33:00.270
MARISHA: Okay, so Keyleth,
pretty pissed off

01:33:00.300 --> 01:33:04.540
from seeing her boyfriend
spiked from the sky.

01:33:04.570 --> 01:33:07.690
I'm going to
kinda get a few,

01:33:07.720 --> 01:33:10.120
well, no, I guess
I can stay here.

01:33:10.150 --> 01:33:12.390
Kind of above the lava

01:33:12.420 --> 01:33:17.090
create a swirling
angry lava vortex

01:33:17.120 --> 01:33:18.870
of lightning and fire

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:20.240
and I'm gonna hit her
again with lightning.

01:33:20.270 --> 01:33:21.780
MATT: Okay.

01:33:21.810 --> 01:33:23.360
Make her save.

01:33:23.390 --> 01:33:26.270
Save 12 plus nine that
is 21, which does save.

01:33:26.300 --> 01:33:27.420
MARISHA: Yeah, she saved.

01:33:27.450 --> 01:33:30.210
MATT: So takes half damage,
so 14 then halved.

01:33:30.240 --> 01:33:32.720
MARISHA: Okay, not too bad.

01:33:32.750 --> 01:33:37.300
Twelve, 14 plus
seven, 21 total.

01:33:37.330 --> 01:33:38.450
Half damage.

01:33:38.480 --> 01:33:39.840
MATT: Okay, so ten points
of lightning damage.

01:33:39.870 --> 01:33:42.630
MARISHA: Not great.

01:33:42.660 --> 01:33:46.120
MATT: Okay, did you want to move or
you gonna stay where you are?

01:33:46.150 --> 01:33:47.720
MARISHA: Um...

01:33:47.750 --> 01:33:49.360
TALIESIN: You can't heal as a
bonus action, can you?

01:33:49.390 --> 01:33:53.000
MARISHA: No, I can't do anything.

01:33:53.030 --> 01:33:57.390
Does-- does Vax look like he's
about to fall in the lava?

01:33:57.420 --> 01:34:01.450
MATT: Vax is approximately
one foot

01:34:01.480 --> 01:34:05.360
from the edge
of the river.

01:34:05.390 --> 01:34:07.870
SAM: One third my size.

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:10.240
TRAVIS: Is it flat or is it...

01:34:10.270 --> 01:34:11.390
MATT: It's slightly domed in.

01:34:11.420 --> 01:34:13.450
MARISHA: Do you have flame
resistance right now?

01:34:13.480 --> 01:34:15.420
Yeah, you said
you're flame resistant.

01:34:15.450 --> 01:34:17.180
TALIESIN: On the armor.

01:34:17.210 --> 01:34:19.750
MARISHA: Okay, so I'm gonna
use my movement then.

01:34:19.780 --> 01:34:22.390
I'm gonna be very careful
to make sure I touch the armor,

01:34:22.420 --> 01:34:23.750
the Raven Queen armor

01:34:23.780 --> 01:34:27.630
and I'm going to see if
I can just fire elemental

01:34:27.660 --> 01:34:31.390
like roll him away
from the edge a little bit.

01:34:31.420 --> 01:34:32.750
MATT: Okay.

01:34:32.780 --> 01:34:35.030
LIAM: The armor is set
to flame resistance.

01:34:35.060 --> 01:34:36.270
MATT: Yes, it is.

01:34:36.300 --> 01:34:37.270
TRAVIS: I thought you were
saying you were gonna like

01:34:37.300 --> 01:34:40.540
roll him in the lava.

01:34:40.570 --> 01:34:41.780
MARISHA: It's been nice.

01:34:41.810 --> 01:34:43.690
(talking over each other)

01:34:47.540 --> 01:34:50.750
MATT: I will say-- I will say the
touch of a fire elemental

01:34:50.780 --> 01:34:52.690
ignites whatever
it touches.

01:34:52.720 --> 01:34:53.750
It's kind of the
essence of the element.

01:34:53.780 --> 01:34:55.060
MARISHA: But he has
fire resistance.

01:34:55.090 --> 01:34:56.060
MATT: Right, which means
he'll take half damage

01:34:56.090 --> 01:34:58.450
from any fire
that you deal.

01:34:58.480 --> 01:35:00.660
However, being the fact

01:35:00.690 --> 01:35:02.060
that you are in
control of your form

01:35:02.090 --> 01:35:03.780
you're not
trying to hurt something,

01:35:03.810 --> 01:35:08.030
I would say that you could
carefully push him aside

01:35:08.060 --> 01:35:11.450
and I'll allow you
a death saving throw

01:35:11.480 --> 01:35:13.720
as opposed to just
taking straight damage.

01:35:13.750 --> 01:35:15.750
LIAM: Okay.

01:35:15.780 --> 01:35:16.750
MATT: I'm making a--

01:35:16.780 --> 01:35:18.450
LIAM: I'm rolling an advantage.

01:35:18.450 --> 01:35:21.030
MATT: An advantage because
of your armor, yeah.

01:35:21.060 --> 01:35:23.240
LIAM: Twelve, succeed.

01:35:23.270 --> 01:35:24.570
So, we're good,
we're good.

01:35:24.600 --> 01:35:26.600
MARISHA: We're cool,
we're good.

01:35:26.630 --> 01:35:27.720
SAM: Here, let me help you.

01:35:27.750 --> 01:35:31.600
Oh God, I killed him.

01:35:31.630 --> 01:35:35.390
LIAM: I feel like in another dimension
this didn't go so well.

01:35:35.420 --> 01:35:37.360
MATT: So you kind of
roll him over...

01:35:37.390 --> 01:35:39.600
MARISHA: That would be the
most Keyleth thing to do.

01:35:39.630 --> 01:35:43.600
I love you so-- oh God,
I killed the thing I love.

01:35:43.630 --> 01:35:47.180
SAM: Oh my God, George, I hugged
the puppy really hard.

01:35:47.210 --> 01:35:49.750
LIAM: No, no, no!

01:35:49.780 --> 01:35:51.390
MARISHA: I'm sorry, George.

01:35:51.420 --> 01:35:52.660
MATT: You barely move him,

01:35:52.690 --> 01:35:54.750
you only get him five feet
from being so careful.

01:35:54.780 --> 01:35:56.300
You could have moved him
further, but he would have--

01:35:56.330 --> 01:35:58.000
been ignited in the process.

01:35:58.030 --> 01:35:59.570
TRAVIS: Oh my God.

01:35:59.600 --> 01:36:02.390
TALIESIN: I got that
extension so bad.

01:36:02.420 --> 01:36:04.000
MATT: Does that end your turn?

01:36:04.030 --> 01:36:07.330
MARISHA: I'm gonna then take a few
steps back away from him now.

01:36:07.360 --> 01:36:09.300
MATT: Okay, back this way,
back where you were?

01:36:09.330 --> 01:36:10.540
MARISHA: Yeah, yes.

01:36:10.570 --> 01:36:14.000
TRAVIS: You would have turned
into a vestige.

01:36:14.030 --> 01:36:15.940
TALIESIN: I don't got to
pretend I'm (indistinct).

01:36:15.940 --> 01:36:17.120
MATT: Okay, that ends your turn?

01:36:17.150 --> 01:36:18.120
-MARISHA: Yeah.
-MATT: Okay.

01:36:18.150 --> 01:36:19.450
At the end of your turn.

01:36:19.480 --> 01:36:22.270
Raishan is still overhead
and casts a spell.

01:36:27.600 --> 01:36:30.660
-LIAM: Duvet, Duvall?
-TRAVIS: Duvet.

01:36:30.690 --> 01:36:32.630
MATT: Alrighty.

01:36:32.660 --> 01:36:36.480
You watch as Raishan
over on the edge...

01:36:38.810 --> 01:36:41.180
her front claws
begin to form

01:36:41.210 --> 01:36:44.150
this strange
geometric sigil

01:36:44.180 --> 01:36:45.480
in the middle of the air

01:36:45.510 --> 01:36:47.390
and each corner of it
is a different color.

01:36:47.420 --> 01:36:51.720
Green, orange, yellow,
red, purple, blue.

01:36:51.750 --> 01:36:54.350
And suddenly
this giant burst--

01:36:54.350 --> 01:36:56.000
SAM: Can I try to
counterspell her?

01:36:56.030 --> 01:36:57.510
MATT: What's the
range on that?

01:36:57.540 --> 01:36:59.180
SAM: 60 feet,
am I just there?

01:36:59.210 --> 01:37:00.630
MARISHA: Come on, Scanlan.

01:37:00.660 --> 01:37:01.690
LAURA: Oh God, Scanlan.

01:37:01.720 --> 01:37:03.390
TRAVIS: What is she casting?

01:37:03.420 --> 01:37:04.570
MATT: She's within range!

01:37:04.600 --> 01:37:06.180
-LAURA: Oh, God!
-TALIESIN: Please, please!

01:37:06.210 --> 01:37:07.840
Please kill it!

01:37:07.870 --> 01:37:10.600
MATT: d20 add six.

01:37:10.630 --> 01:37:12.120
SAM: Eighteen.

01:37:12.150 --> 01:37:13.300
MATT: You rolled an 18?

01:37:13.330 --> 01:37:14.720
SAM: No, I rolled a 12.

01:37:14.750 --> 01:37:17.210
MATT: You rolled a 12,
that's an 18 total?

01:37:17.240 --> 01:37:20.090
It is a...

01:37:20.120 --> 01:37:21.510
Hold on a second.

01:37:21.540 --> 01:37:22.600
TALIESIN: God, I can't breathe.

01:37:22.630 --> 01:37:24.290
MATT: I'm pretty sure...

01:37:27.630 --> 01:37:29.360
SAM: I get a plus two for--

01:37:29.390 --> 01:37:31.030
MATT: Right, oh, I know.

01:37:31.060 --> 01:37:33.180
The sigil-- as the
burst of colored light

01:37:33.210 --> 01:37:35.780
begins to spray forward,
you watch as it just...

01:37:35.810 --> 01:37:40.150
(cheering)

01:37:40.180 --> 01:37:42.190
LAURA: Scanlan! MVP!

01:37:44.300 --> 01:37:46.030
LIAM: Vax wakes up for
two seconds, says,

01:37:46.060 --> 01:37:48.390
"You da man!" and
then lies back down.

01:37:48.420 --> 01:37:50.480
(laughter)

01:37:50.510 --> 01:37:51.720
MATT: Shit.

01:37:51.750 --> 01:37:54.330
I never get to
use Prismatic Spray.

01:37:54.360 --> 01:37:56.120
TRAVIS: That was a day
ruiner, right?

01:37:56.150 --> 01:37:57.150
Day ruiner.

01:37:57.180 --> 01:38:00.860
(talking over each other)

01:38:00.860 --> 01:38:03.480
There's no chance that was
like a healing spray, was it?

01:38:03.510 --> 01:38:05.000
LIAM: Probably not.

01:38:05.030 --> 01:38:06.910
TRAVIS: Like the gesture
of surrender?

01:38:06.910 --> 01:38:09.330
LIAM: It was kind of
like rainbows.

01:38:09.360 --> 01:38:13.510
TALIESIN: It's the angriest Captain
Planet-- it's just the worst--

01:38:13.540 --> 01:38:17.150
MARISHA: Like the most fucked
up Care Bear stare.

01:38:18.030 --> 01:38:22.120
MATT: Alright, so, as the
spell dissipates...

01:38:24.540 --> 01:38:25.810
Raishan angrily...

01:38:25.840 --> 01:38:30.810
SAM: ♪ You got eggs and
you gonna lose 'em ♪

01:38:30.840 --> 01:38:32.300
♪ You got eggs ♪♪

01:38:32.330 --> 01:38:33.660
LAURA: Oh God.

01:38:33.690 --> 01:38:36.390
MATT: Alright, so that ends--
that ends Keyleth's turn.

01:38:36.420 --> 01:38:39.210
That brings us to Gilmore.

01:38:39.240 --> 01:38:41.210
Now, Gilmore over here is--

01:38:41.240 --> 01:38:43.570
what else does he have
left in the tank here?

01:38:48.090 --> 01:38:51.480
He's gonna do a level
four Lightning Bolt.

01:38:51.510 --> 01:38:53.540
TALIESIN: Chromatic spray.

01:38:53.570 --> 01:38:55.970
SAM: Chromatic spray could have
been many things though.

01:38:55.970 --> 01:38:57.540
TALIESIN: Yes, but they're all bad.

01:38:57.570 --> 01:39:00.160
-It's a wheel of death.
-SAM: And they're all bad.

01:39:00.160 --> 01:39:03.120
One of them's
like 70 points of...

01:39:03.150 --> 01:39:05.180
-MARISHA: Yeah.
-TALIESIN: Of just-- just goop.

01:39:05.210 --> 01:39:08.180
MARISHA: Each color
is like bad.

01:39:08.210 --> 01:39:10.050
MATT: Gilmore is going to...

01:39:11.660 --> 01:39:13.780
TALIESIN: It's a great way of dealing
with people who are--

01:39:13.810 --> 01:39:16.060
who are attuned
to deal with you.

01:39:16.090 --> 01:39:18.510
(indistinct talking)

01:39:20.930 --> 01:39:23.150
TALIESIN: You were looking
at that for a while.

01:39:23.150 --> 01:39:24.630
SAM: Yeah, I was, it was good.

01:39:24.660 --> 01:39:27.390
-It looks good.
-TALIESIN: It's really good.

01:39:27.420 --> 01:39:30.360
-It's very you too.
-SAM: Rainbow colored.

01:39:34.390 --> 01:39:36.660
MATT: Sorry.

01:39:36.690 --> 01:39:38.600
LAURA: Check out those
Gilmore t-shirts.

01:39:38.630 --> 01:39:40.330
MATT: I know, sorry, I'm
checking to make sure

01:39:40.360 --> 01:39:42.090
he can do this cause this
is what he's trying to do.

01:39:42.120 --> 01:39:44.090
LIAM: Gilmore's wearing
one right now.

01:39:44.120 --> 01:39:48.330
SAM: Hey, Laura, are those
key chains laser etched?

01:39:48.360 --> 01:39:49.360
LAURA: Why, they are!

01:39:49.390 --> 01:39:50.510
It's so funny
you should ask.

01:39:50.540 --> 01:39:51.690
SAM: Wow, what about the--

01:39:51.720 --> 01:39:53.060
LAURA: So precise.

01:39:53.090 --> 01:39:54.360
SAM: Did I say the key chain
or the necklace?

01:39:54.390 --> 01:39:55.450
What about the necklace?

01:39:55.480 --> 01:39:57.980
MATT: So, Gilmore--
Gilmore runs up.

01:40:00.090 --> 01:40:01.750
And just vanishes
from his place

01:40:01.780 --> 01:40:05.240
and instantly blinks
up over into this area

01:40:05.270 --> 01:40:08.360
using his misty step
as his bonus action.

01:40:08.390 --> 01:40:10.300
And looks upward.

01:40:10.330 --> 01:40:11.570
"How do you like it?"

01:40:11.600 --> 01:40:13.780
Raises his hand
and pulls this way.

01:40:13.810 --> 01:40:15.540
You watch as this
necromantic energy

01:40:15.570 --> 01:40:17.190
begins to gather
around his hands.

01:40:17.190 --> 01:40:19.480
A familiar spell
to you, Keyleth.

01:40:19.510 --> 01:40:22.090
As you watch the
diseased blackened veins

01:40:22.120 --> 01:40:25.480
up the side of Raishan's
body begin to spread

01:40:25.510 --> 01:40:27.870
and grow momentarily
and kind of begin to--

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:30.880
to dig their way
into her throat.

01:40:30.880 --> 01:40:32.300
She begins
to pull backward,

01:40:32.330 --> 01:40:35.570
unfamiliar with this
sudden internal pain.

01:40:35.600 --> 01:40:38.810
Rolls a natural
20 for her save.

01:40:38.840 --> 01:40:40.240
But regardless,
that's still--

01:40:40.270 --> 01:40:41.810
LAURA: I like how he genuinely
looked kind of disappointed

01:40:41.840 --> 01:40:43.210
though that
he rolled a 20.

01:40:43.240 --> 01:40:44.360
TRAVIS: I think he's just--

01:40:44.390 --> 01:40:45.420
LAURA: It made me--
it made me feel great.

01:40:45.450 --> 01:40:46.720
LIAM: He's a really good actor.

01:40:46.750 --> 01:40:48.840
SAM: See, we're not even
gonna need the flute guy.

01:40:48.840 --> 01:40:50.300
LAURA: I hope he shows up.

01:40:50.330 --> 01:40:51.570
I hope he's not like...

01:40:51.600 --> 01:40:54.180
TALIESIN: No, a month from
now he's gonna show up.

01:40:54.210 --> 01:40:56.840
TRAVIS: Attacking like
his carry-on?

01:40:56.870 --> 01:40:59.630
SAM: He's at TSA right now.

01:40:59.660 --> 01:41:01.510
"I have nothing
else metal on me.

01:41:01.540 --> 01:41:04.690
I don't-- oh, I'm bronze."

01:41:06.270 --> 01:41:10.300
MATT: Seventeen points of necrotic
damage to Raishan with the save.

01:41:10.330 --> 01:41:12.330
That's Gilmore's
turn there.

01:41:12.360 --> 01:41:13.930
That brings us to...

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:17.210
Grog.

01:41:17.240 --> 01:41:19.570
-TRAVIS: Me?
-MATT: Yes.

01:41:19.600 --> 01:41:22.420
TALIESIN: Your dragon-based humor
is way too tight right now.

01:41:22.450 --> 01:41:25.210
TRAVIS: Can I run
over with Shaun?

01:41:25.240 --> 01:41:27.670
MATT: Yeah.

01:41:27.670 --> 01:41:30.330
TRAVIS: Can I attach the Chain
of Returning to the axe?

01:41:30.360 --> 01:41:31.510
MATT: Yes.

01:41:31.540 --> 01:41:33.480
TRAVIS: Then, can I swing
it really hard and go,

01:41:33.510 --> 01:41:34.810
"Yeah, catchphrase!"

01:41:34.840 --> 01:41:36.030
and throw it up.

01:41:36.060 --> 01:41:38.330
(laughter)

01:41:38.360 --> 01:41:39.660
MATT: Yes, you can.

01:41:39.690 --> 01:41:41.060
TRAVIS: Good, reckless, please.

01:41:41.060 --> 01:41:42.250
MATT: Yes, you may.

01:41:42.250 --> 01:41:44.420
-SAM: Laura.
-TRAVIS: That's a natural 20.

01:41:44.450 --> 01:41:47.750
-MARISHA: Whoo!
-MATT: Oh, shit!

01:41:47.780 --> 01:41:49.720
Alright.

01:41:49.750 --> 01:41:53.120
TRAVIS: Oh, and with the
brutal critical,

01:41:53.150 --> 01:41:54.360
I get two additional...

01:41:54.390 --> 01:41:56.580
MATT: Yeah, two additional
d12's to that,

01:41:56.580 --> 01:41:57.780
so roll the die first.

01:42:03.300 --> 01:42:07.330
Plus don't forget you
double the necrotic die.

01:42:07.360 --> 01:42:09.390
TRAVIS: Yeah, I do double it?

01:42:09.420 --> 01:42:12.720
MATT: Yeah.

01:42:12.750 --> 01:42:13.810
LIAM: Yes!

01:42:13.840 --> 01:42:17.570
TRAVIS: That's a six,
so that's 12.

01:42:17.600 --> 01:42:20.600
I'm enlarged. Where's the triangle,
who took the triangle?

01:42:20.630 --> 01:42:22.180
LAURA: I don't-- here you go.

01:42:22.210 --> 01:42:23.870
TALIESIN: You got like
valley girl on that.

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:25.390
"Who took the triangle?"

01:42:25.420 --> 01:42:27.930
TRAVIS: That's 29 and then
two additional d12.

01:42:27.930 --> 01:42:29.170
MATT: Correct.

01:42:30.750 --> 01:42:34.210
TRAVIS: Nine, 38.

01:42:34.240 --> 01:42:36.420
Ten, 48.

01:42:36.450 --> 01:42:37.400
MATT: 48?

01:42:39.870 --> 01:42:41.510
Okay.

01:42:41.540 --> 01:42:43.270
LAURA: Did you double
those extras?

01:42:43.300 --> 01:42:44.270
Do you double
those dice as well?

01:42:44.300 --> 01:42:45.390
-TRAVIS: No.
-LAURA: Okay.

01:42:45.420 --> 01:42:46.780
TRAVIS: Brutal critical, you get
two additional damage

01:42:46.810 --> 01:42:48.390
die on my roll.

01:42:48.420 --> 01:42:50.660
MATT: Okay, so, as you rush up,
"Catchphrase!"

01:42:50.690 --> 01:42:53.780
and throw the
axe sideways.

01:42:53.810 --> 01:42:55.870
It arcs upward and
Raishan is currently

01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:57.510
kind of reeling
from the dispel

01:42:57.540 --> 01:43:01.660
and angrily yelling
into the room in draconic.

01:43:01.690 --> 01:43:04.450
Gets partway into a phrase,
just finishing...

01:43:04.480 --> 01:43:05.720
(roaring)

01:43:05.750 --> 01:43:09.090
The axe just jams into the
side of her collarbone

01:43:09.120 --> 01:43:12.090
and front torso area and...

01:43:12.120 --> 01:43:16.790
The axe is still kind of wedged
there, are you gonna pull back?

01:43:16.790 --> 01:43:18.570
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'll
pull it back.

01:43:18.600 --> 01:43:20.450
MATT: So go ahead
and roll your...

01:43:20.480 --> 01:43:23.180
TALIESIN: I don't know why you're
looking over here for that.

01:43:23.210 --> 01:43:24.750
TRAVIS: Yeah, I got it. 23.

01:43:26.840 --> 01:43:29.720
MATT: So, yanking the axe, dislodges
itself and you catch it.

01:43:29.750 --> 01:43:33.000
You see it's covered
in Raishan blood.

01:43:33.030 --> 01:43:35.300
As you pull the axe back, you
watch as something just, like,

01:43:35.330 --> 01:43:37.480
a flash of arcane
energy around her,

01:43:37.510 --> 01:43:39.300
and some sort of spell,

01:43:39.330 --> 01:43:41.510
uncast by her,
just seemingly

01:43:41.540 --> 01:43:44.030
automatically just
kind of surrounds her

01:43:44.060 --> 01:43:47.360
and her flying
begins to speed up.

01:43:49.120 --> 01:43:51.570
LAURA: She got hasted?

01:43:51.600 --> 01:43:52.870
-MARISHA: But how?
-LAURA: How?

01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:54.600
TRAVIS: I didn't know
I was this powerful.

01:43:54.630 --> 01:43:56.360
What the fuck happened?

01:43:56.390 --> 01:43:57.870
LAURA: How did she get hasted?

01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:00.120
LIAM: Well, we'll find out.

01:44:00.150 --> 01:44:02.720
LAURA: What if the brass
dragon's helping her?

01:44:02.750 --> 01:44:05.810
TALIESIN: Or what if the eggs
are helping her?

01:44:05.840 --> 01:44:08.210
MATT: Yeah, you have
maybe 15 more feet.

01:44:08.240 --> 01:44:10.920
TALIESIN: I don't know, I just like
putting things out there.

01:44:10.920 --> 01:44:13.600
TRAVIS: Rolling towards that end
of the map as far as I go.

01:44:13.630 --> 01:44:15.360
MATT: This end, sure.

01:44:15.390 --> 01:44:16.670
LAURA: That end of the map.

01:44:16.670 --> 01:44:18.690
TRAVIS: Can I go that way?

01:44:18.720 --> 01:44:21.120
Yeah, that's cool.

01:44:21.150 --> 01:44:22.810
-Cool.
-MATT: Great.

01:44:22.840 --> 01:44:24.000
LAURA: Oh God.

01:44:24.030 --> 01:44:26.650
MATT: That puts you at
the end of your turn.

01:44:28.810 --> 01:44:30.840
She's gonna use
legendary action.

01:44:30.870 --> 01:44:34.120
At this point in her kind of,
sped up form, she begins to...

01:44:34.150 --> 01:44:36.030
(chanting)

01:44:36.060 --> 01:44:39.330
And there's a slight
ripple again in the air

01:44:39.360 --> 01:44:44.030
similar to what Gilmore
did towards Raishan

01:44:44.060 --> 01:44:45.570
early part of the battle.

01:44:45.600 --> 01:44:48.420
Let me see the...

01:44:48.450 --> 01:44:52.120
TALIESIN: We're making some bad groupings
there, by the way, people.

01:44:52.150 --> 01:44:53.690
MATT: Yeah.

01:44:57.690 --> 01:45:01.480
You feel a kind
of a strange warmth

01:45:01.510 --> 01:45:04.510
and tingling sensation
within your body, Scanlan.

01:45:04.540 --> 01:45:06.660
SAM: Oh, what, me?

01:45:06.690 --> 01:45:08.680
But I didn't
do anything.

01:45:09.840 --> 01:45:12.120
TALIESIN: You relieve
yourself gently.

01:45:12.150 --> 01:45:14.810
LAURA: Did you just pee?

01:45:14.840 --> 01:45:16.240
TALIESIN: I cast Tinkle.

01:45:16.270 --> 01:45:17.840
SAM: I don't get to save or
anything, it just happens?

01:45:17.870 --> 01:45:19.810
MATT: It's not a save, it's
against an effect on you

01:45:19.840 --> 01:45:21.270
and she rolls to--
just like how you roll

01:45:21.300 --> 01:45:23.360
to overcome her
spell's counter spell,

01:45:23.390 --> 01:45:24.600
she gets to roll
to overcome

01:45:24.630 --> 01:45:26.030
whatever effect is on
you with dispel magic.

01:45:26.060 --> 01:45:27.450
SAM: Okay.

01:45:27.480 --> 01:45:31.420
MATT: So, that's gonna be the last
of her legendary actions.

01:45:31.450 --> 01:45:33.210
LAURA: She just dispelled all of us.

01:45:33.240 --> 01:45:35.180
Can we bust out
a feast right now?

01:45:35.210 --> 01:45:37.690
-Just like sit down.
-TALIESIN: We can make eggs benedict.

01:45:37.720 --> 01:45:40.300
We have the makings
for eggs benedict.

01:45:41.420 --> 01:45:44.120
SAM: Does that dispel my fire
resistance as well?

01:45:44.150 --> 01:45:46.090
MATT: No, it only affected
the Heroes' Feast.

01:45:46.120 --> 01:45:47.220
SAM: Okay.

01:45:47.220 --> 01:45:49.210
You'll have to
explain that sometime.

01:45:49.240 --> 01:45:51.000
MATT: Vex, you're up.

01:45:51.030 --> 01:45:52.750
LAURA: So, giving a potion to
somebody is a full action?

01:45:52.780 --> 01:45:55.240
MATT: Yes.

01:45:55.270 --> 01:45:57.120
Cause you have to basically
get there, open it,

01:45:57.150 --> 01:45:58.720
grab them and help
them swallow it

01:45:58.720 --> 01:46:00.240
to have the
effect take place.

01:46:00.270 --> 01:46:03.150
It's a pretty
involved action.

01:46:03.180 --> 01:46:05.750
SAM: That means we don't have
advantage on death saves either.

01:46:05.780 --> 01:46:07.180
Right, wait.

01:46:07.210 --> 01:46:08.630
-LAURA: Did we ever?
-SAM: Yeah, we did.

01:46:08.660 --> 01:46:10.180
LAURA: Oh, that's from
Beacon of Hope.

01:46:10.210 --> 01:46:11.480
That's gone anyway.

01:46:11.510 --> 01:46:12.540
SAM: Is that gone, okay?

01:46:12.570 --> 01:46:14.030
TALIESIN: Yeah, that got eaten.

01:46:14.060 --> 01:46:16.990
LAURA: Okay, then I'm gonna
fly down to my brother.

01:46:18.330 --> 01:46:20.360
And I'm gonna
cast Cure Wounds

01:46:20.390 --> 01:46:23.780
on him at fourth level,

01:46:23.810 --> 01:46:26.210
so that's 4d8.

01:46:26.240 --> 01:46:27.570
SAM: 4d8?

01:46:27.600 --> 01:46:39.120
♪

01:46:39.150 --> 01:46:40.720
LAURA: Oh, 19 plus
eight, wow, 27.

01:46:40.750 --> 01:46:43.600
-SAM: Wow.
-LIAM: Thank you.

01:46:45.470 --> 01:46:47.190
LAURA: You don't got
no wings anymore.

01:46:47.190 --> 01:46:49.000
-LIAM: She dead?
-LAURA: No.

01:46:49.030 --> 01:46:50.780
LIAM: Oh, shit.

01:46:50.810 --> 01:46:52.450
LAURA: Get away
from the lava.

01:46:52.480 --> 01:46:56.300
And then, I'm gonna
fly away from the lava.

01:46:56.330 --> 01:46:57.840
-Up.
-MATT: This way?

01:46:57.870 --> 01:46:59.240
-TRAVIS: Towards Matt.
-LAURA: Yeah, towards Matt.

01:46:59.270 --> 01:47:00.600
Up and towards Matt.

01:47:00.630 --> 01:47:02.390
-MATT: Up and towards me.
-LAURA: Kind of away from Pike.

01:47:02.420 --> 01:47:05.180
Actually,
let's go, oh God.

01:47:05.210 --> 01:47:06.480
MATT: This way?

01:47:06.510 --> 01:47:09.220
LAURA: Yes, yes, what
you just did.

01:47:10.480 --> 01:47:11.750
That way.

01:47:11.780 --> 01:47:14.350
MATT: That's about as far
as you can go right there.

01:47:14.350 --> 01:47:15.120
Okay.

01:47:15.150 --> 01:47:16.150
LAURA: And I get a bonus.

01:47:16.180 --> 01:47:17.750
I can do something
with a bonus.

01:47:17.780 --> 01:47:20.240
I'm gonna
re-Hunter's Mark her.

01:47:20.270 --> 01:47:22.160
-MATT: Yeah, cause you--
-LAURA: Yeah.

01:47:22.160 --> 01:47:24.030
MATT: Alright, so
Hunter's Mark reapplied.

01:47:24.060 --> 01:47:25.210
LAURA: Oh, wait!

01:47:25.240 --> 01:47:27.190
I can take a potion
for myself as a bonus.

01:47:27.190 --> 01:47:28.540
-MATT: Yes.
-LAURA: I'm gonna do that.

01:47:28.570 --> 01:47:29.540
MATT: Alright, go for it.

01:47:29.570 --> 01:47:30.600
TALIESIN: Yeah.

01:47:30.630 --> 01:47:32.390
-Get it.
-LAURA: Okay.

01:47:32.420 --> 01:47:33.600
MATT: Just a regular potion?

01:47:33.630 --> 01:47:36.240
-LAURA: Just a Superior.
-MATT: Oh, right.

01:47:36.270 --> 01:47:37.750
LAURA: That my brother gave me.

01:47:37.780 --> 01:47:40.000
MATT: That is an
8d4 plus eight.

01:47:42.690 --> 01:47:44.000
LAURA: It's a four.

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:46.870
TRAVIS: Easter egg.

01:47:55.630 --> 01:47:57.750
LAURA: Seventeen plus eight.

01:47:57.780 --> 01:47:59.620
TRAVIS: You have one
more dice to roll.

01:47:59.620 --> 01:48:01.090
-LAURA: I do?
-TRAVIS: Yep.

01:48:01.120 --> 01:48:02.240
LAURA: Ooh.

01:48:02.270 --> 01:48:04.480
So, 21 plus
eight, so 29.

01:48:04.510 --> 01:48:05.660
MATT: Nice.

01:48:05.690 --> 01:48:07.720
SAM: You healed
yourself that much?

01:48:07.750 --> 01:48:09.540
Jesus, that's
a big potion.

01:48:09.570 --> 01:48:11.570
LAURA: Yeah that was,
I rolled really well.

01:48:11.600 --> 01:48:13.570
TALIESIN: I may make one
for the table.

01:48:13.570 --> 01:48:16.390
LAURA: I didn't trust that
I would roll that well.

01:48:16.420 --> 01:48:18.240
MATT: That ends your turn, Vex?

01:48:18.270 --> 01:48:19.600
-LAURA: Yes.
-MATT: Vax, you're up.

01:48:19.630 --> 01:48:21.150
LIAM: Okay, so half my movement just
to get to standing, right?

01:48:21.180 --> 01:48:22.390
MATT: Correct.

01:48:22.420 --> 01:48:25.750
LIAM: Okay, I'm gonna throw
Whisper, Flame tongue.

01:48:25.780 --> 01:48:27.630
Raishan should be
within 60 feet, yeah?

01:48:27.660 --> 01:48:30.120
-MATT: Uh, yeah.
-LIAM: Okay.

01:48:34.420 --> 01:48:36.360
-Seventeen for the first.
-MATT: Fails.

01:48:36.390 --> 01:48:39.000
-LIAM: Second is 22.
-MATT: Twenty-two just hits.

01:48:41.600 --> 01:48:44.060
TRAVIS: That's it, that's
Raishan at 22.

01:48:44.090 --> 01:48:45.300
-LIAM: Ten.
-TALIESIN: 22?

01:48:45.330 --> 01:48:46.450
-MARISHA: She's 22.
-MATT: How much damage?

01:48:46.480 --> 01:48:48.780
-LIAM: Ten.
-MATT: Ten points damage.

01:48:48.810 --> 01:48:52.090
LIAM: And I'm going to use my
remaining 15 of movement

01:48:52.120 --> 01:48:56.660
to go diagonally
away from Raishan.

01:48:56.690 --> 01:48:58.120
MATT: Diagonally away this way?

01:48:58.150 --> 01:48:59.810
LIAM: Away from-- diagonal.

01:48:59.840 --> 01:49:01.390
-MATT: Here?
-LIAM: Yeah.

01:49:01.420 --> 01:49:03.390
MATT: Okay, that's as far
as you can get there.

01:49:03.420 --> 01:49:04.750
Okay.

01:49:04.780 --> 01:49:06.120
That ends your turn.

01:49:06.150 --> 01:49:09.260
That brings us to Kima.

01:49:10.870 --> 01:49:14.000
Let's see.

01:49:14.030 --> 01:49:15.840
Kima rushes in with
Holy Avenger,

01:49:15.870 --> 01:49:19.820
and looks over at the distant
dragon and goes, "Oh, shit.

01:49:20.360 --> 01:49:21.660
Who's hurting?"

01:49:21.690 --> 01:49:23.230
LAURA: Everyone.

01:49:23.840 --> 01:49:25.240
SAM: I'm fine.

01:49:25.270 --> 01:49:28.360
LAURA (as PIKE): "I am, I don't want
to say anything though,

01:49:28.360 --> 01:49:29.570
but I kind of am.

01:49:29.570 --> 01:49:30.850
I feel kind of shitty.

01:49:37.720 --> 01:49:39.270
I--I feel like shit."

01:49:39.300 --> 01:49:42.000
-LIAM: "Um..."
-LAURA: "Um..."

01:49:42.030 --> 01:49:44.690
SAM: "I'm kind of bleeding
from my ears, but, whatever."

01:49:44.720 --> 01:49:48.210
MATT: Kima as an action
is gonna cast a...

01:49:48.240 --> 01:49:49.870
LAURA: "I can deal with it.

01:49:49.870 --> 01:49:51.450
It's no big deal."

01:49:51.480 --> 01:49:53.750
MATT: I'm gonna say third
level Cure Wounds.

01:50:00.030 --> 01:50:01.510
LIAM: Matt, my wings
are toast, right?

01:50:01.540 --> 01:50:02.660
MATT: Yeah.

01:50:02.690 --> 01:50:05.180
That's 17 points
of healing to Pike.

01:50:05.210 --> 01:50:07.660
LAURA: Okay, thank you.

01:50:07.690 --> 01:50:10.450
MATT: I think Kima's just
gonna go at a full run.

01:50:10.450 --> 01:50:13.060
(indistinct talking)

01:50:13.090 --> 01:50:15.480
Right, that ends Kima's turn.

01:50:15.510 --> 01:50:18.210
There is a
flash of light

01:50:18.240 --> 01:50:22.060
in the tunnel
behind you guys.

01:50:22.090 --> 01:50:24.850
As a sudden burst
of kind of...

01:50:26.120 --> 01:50:29.150
a whitish orangish energy

01:50:29.180 --> 01:50:33.380
that briefly halos Kima,
Scanlan, and Pike's forms.

01:50:34.810 --> 01:50:38.390
As you watch,
a brass talon...

01:50:38.420 --> 01:50:41.390
(cheering)

01:50:41.420 --> 01:50:45.060
A brass talon, that since it was
used as the top of our tree,

01:50:45.090 --> 01:50:48.760
I forgot to bring its base,
but he'll be acting there.

01:50:48.760 --> 01:50:50.570
TALIESIN: It was a beautiful tree.

01:50:50.600 --> 01:50:53.630
-LAURA: Hey, look, he's standing!
-MARISHA: He's standing.

01:50:53.660 --> 01:50:55.780
TALIESIN: You've been drinking,
brass dragon.

01:50:55.810 --> 01:50:57.660
LAURA: Oh, J'Mon,
you looking good.

01:50:57.690 --> 01:50:59.840
-LIAM: J'Mon!
-LAURA: J'Mon!

01:50:59.870 --> 01:51:01.180
TALIESIN: Have you been
working out?

01:51:01.210 --> 01:51:02.840
You look like you've
been working out.

01:51:02.870 --> 01:51:05.750
MATT: He watches as they arrive

01:51:07.810 --> 01:51:10.700
and kind of bully
their way past the entrance.

01:51:12.030 --> 01:51:15.150
"I was wondering
when you'd call."

01:51:16.390 --> 01:51:18.090
SAM: Glad you came!

01:51:19.025 --> 01:51:21.055
TRAVIS: Nothing cool,
nothing cool with that!

01:51:21.055 --> 01:51:22.840
TALIESIN: Swipe right, swipe right!

01:51:22.840 --> 01:51:24.660
TRAVIS: Sure is glad
you're here!

01:51:24.690 --> 01:51:26.770
SAM: We're happy
to see you?

01:51:29.510 --> 01:51:31.060
TRAVIS: No court speak here.

01:51:31.090 --> 01:51:33.230
SAM: How-- how
was the flight?

01:51:34.180 --> 01:51:36.180
MATT: Actually,
I broke my platforms,

01:51:36.210 --> 01:51:39.060
so I'll just have to use my
imagination for some of this.

01:51:39.090 --> 01:51:41.030
SAM: We need modeling
clay, quick!

01:51:41.060 --> 01:51:44.460
TALIESIN: Fishing wire, we can just string
it from the top of the set.

01:51:44.460 --> 01:51:46.570
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, just
attach it to a string.

01:51:46.600 --> 01:51:47.950
MATT: There we go.

01:51:49.420 --> 01:51:53.600
J'Mon, they kind of stomp
their way into the room,

01:51:53.630 --> 01:51:55.060
stepping over
you, Scanlan.

01:51:55.090 --> 01:51:59.780
Stepping
past you, Vax.

01:51:59.810 --> 01:52:02.830
Nestles in, kind of
surveys the territory.

01:52:04.600 --> 01:52:07.420
"A different color
than I was expecting."

01:52:13.240 --> 01:52:16.470
And releases a blast
of fire breath

01:52:16.470 --> 01:52:18.130
upwards in
the direction--

01:52:18.130 --> 01:52:19.780
TRAVIS: Smoke 'em if
you got 'em.

01:52:19.810 --> 01:52:21.450
C'mon, J'Mon.

01:52:21.480 --> 01:52:23.660
LAURA: ♪ J'Mon ♪
TALIESIN: ♪ J'Mon ♪♪

01:52:28.510 --> 01:52:31.060
MATT: That is a 23.

01:52:31.090 --> 01:52:33.510
Okay, makes
the dex save,

01:52:33.540 --> 01:52:35.810
so Raishan pulls
out of the way

01:52:35.840 --> 01:52:38.110
with a benefit from
the haste spell.

01:52:38.110 --> 01:52:41.890
However it does still
take damage.

01:52:42.450 --> 01:52:44.540
Half damage
from the spell.

01:52:44.570 --> 01:52:47.570
That's 16d6 damage.

01:52:47.600 --> 01:52:51.540
-LAURA: Wow.
-TRAVIS: 16d6.

01:52:51.570 --> 01:52:53.330
Well, that might actually help.

01:52:53.330 --> 01:52:55.730
LIAM: Nobody expects
the Marquette inquisition.

01:52:56.330 --> 01:52:58.770
MATT: That is 58
points fire damage,

01:52:58.770 --> 01:53:00.360
half of that to 20...

01:53:04.240 --> 01:53:05.540
29, whoo, pardon me.

01:53:05.570 --> 01:53:06.570
LAURA: Did you just burp
or did you just--

01:53:06.570 --> 01:53:07.750
MATT: I did.

01:53:07.750 --> 01:53:10.230
MATT: Twenty nine points of
fire damage to Raishan

01:53:10.230 --> 01:53:14.000
from Devo'ssa's
Flame breath.

01:53:14.030 --> 01:53:16.660
J'Mon Sa Ord, as you know.

01:53:16.690 --> 01:53:17.660
TRAVIS: Wow.

01:53:17.690 --> 01:53:19.420
MATT: She makes a concentration check.

01:53:19.450 --> 01:53:20.540
Succeeds.

01:53:20.570 --> 01:53:22.360
TRAVIS: Damn it.

01:53:22.390 --> 01:53:25.660
MATT: So, the haste
remains viable.

01:53:25.690 --> 01:53:29.060
Okay, that ends
J'Mon's turn.

01:53:29.090 --> 01:53:30.450
Pike is up.

01:53:30.480 --> 01:53:31.870
LAURA: Okay.

their head beneath the wing

these strange protrusions

02:01:34.210 --> 02:01:37.210
from the rocky ground
begins to bow upward

02:01:37.240 --> 02:01:40.720
and then crack open as
another familiar cloud of gas

02:01:40.750 --> 02:01:44.330
begins to spill
out in this area.

02:01:45.810 --> 02:01:47.060
TRAVIS: But you're
totally immune.

02:01:47.090 --> 02:01:50.330
MATT: Vax, Vex, Scanlan.

02:01:50.360 --> 02:01:52.120
I need you guys

02:01:52.150 --> 02:01:55.430
to make constitution
saving throws.

02:01:56.150 --> 02:01:57.180
SAM: Nope.

02:01:57.210 --> 02:01:58.690
LAURA: This is just the worst.

02:01:58.690 --> 02:02:00.570
-MATT: J'Mon.
-LAURA: ♪ J'Mon ♪♪

02:02:00.600 --> 02:02:02.330
MATT: Does make it, yes.

02:02:02.360 --> 02:02:03.640
SAM: Four.

02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:07.540
-LAURA: Fourteen.
-LIAM: Eighteen.

02:02:07.570 --> 02:02:10.240
-MATT: Okay, you do make it.
-LIAM: Eighteen.

02:02:10.270 --> 02:02:13.210
MATT: Eighteen, yes, the two
of you manage to succeed.

02:02:13.240 --> 02:02:14.810
Pike as well?

02:02:14.840 --> 02:02:16.900
TALIESIN: Oh, yeah, medicine
won't heal it.

02:02:19.150 --> 02:02:20.340
LAURA: Hold on.

02:02:21.620 --> 02:02:23.010
TRAVIS: That's gotta make it.

02:02:23.010 --> 02:02:25.060
-LIAM: Thirteen.
-LAURA: Fourteen.

02:02:25.090 --> 02:02:26.580
MATT: Okay.

02:02:29.180 --> 02:02:32.360
So, this cloud is still kind
of permeating this area.

02:02:32.390 --> 02:02:33.470
Obscuring it slightly.

02:02:33.470 --> 02:02:35.340
Ending that now
it is Raishan's--

02:02:35.340 --> 02:02:37.570
SAM: Wait, what did I do,
what happened to me?

02:02:37.600 --> 02:02:39.330
-MATT: You rolled a four.
-SAM: Yeah.

02:02:39.360 --> 02:02:41.280
MATT: So, when your turn
comes around next...

02:02:41.280 --> 02:02:43.460
-SAM: I die.
-TRAVIS: I'll let you know.

02:02:43.460 --> 02:02:45.750
MATT: No, you'll just be
coughing and incapacitated.

02:02:45.750 --> 02:02:47.000
The coughing fit

02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:48.750
that this poison gas
creates is so bad

02:02:48.780 --> 02:02:50.450
that you can't do
anything but hack.

02:02:50.480 --> 02:02:52.120
TRAVIS: It is called LA Smog.

02:02:52.150 --> 02:02:53.140
MATT: Yes.

02:02:54.720 --> 02:02:56.480
Now, being Raishan's turn.

02:03:01.540 --> 02:03:03.240
Still hasted, pardon me.

02:03:07.810 --> 02:03:11.360
Raishan is going
to dart backward...

02:03:13.360 --> 02:03:16.060
and snatch up this
one egg with her claws.

02:03:16.090 --> 02:03:19.540
Grabs it and kind of
carries it up underneath.

02:03:19.570 --> 02:03:21.240
MARISHA: Bitch cares.

02:03:21.270 --> 02:03:22.840
-LAURA: She does care!
-MARISHA: She cares!

02:03:22.870 --> 02:03:24.210
LAURA: Let's kill
them eggs.

02:03:24.210 --> 02:03:25.660
TALIESIN: Care Bear stare!

02:03:25.690 --> 02:03:28.350
SAM: Wait, maybe she's just
trying to be a good mom.

02:03:28.350 --> 02:03:30.840
TALIESIN: She's gonna
throw it at us.

02:03:30.870 --> 02:03:33.240
MARISHA: Google Donkey Kong.

02:03:33.270 --> 02:03:35.240
TALIESIN: She could go all
Donkey Kong on us.

02:03:35.270 --> 02:03:37.510
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah.

02:03:37.540 --> 02:03:39.540
(indistinct talking)

02:03:43.090 --> 02:03:46.390
LAURA: (yells)

02:03:46.420 --> 02:03:49.330
MATT: So, that's 20 to get there
and back to grab that.

02:03:49.360 --> 02:03:52.390
She kinda swoops
down, grabs it.

02:03:52.420 --> 02:03:55.690
Moves forward
ever so slightly

02:03:55.720 --> 02:03:58.660
this way, and...

02:04:01.660 --> 02:04:03.840
No, from back here.

02:04:03.870 --> 02:04:08.210
Is going to release a giant
burst of poisonous gas

02:04:08.240 --> 02:04:11.840
outward, affecting--

02:04:11.870 --> 02:04:14.950
Kima shrugs it off,
Pike shrugs it off.

02:04:16.450 --> 02:04:18.060
Grog, you shrug it off

02:04:18.090 --> 02:04:21.840
cause you resist the dispel
that didn't work earlier.

02:04:21.870 --> 02:04:26.510
Gilmore ate the Feast earlier
and is also unaffected.

02:04:26.540 --> 02:04:27.720
However, I need...

02:04:27.750 --> 02:04:29.970
LAURA: Gilmore
didn't get the Feast.

02:04:29.980 --> 02:04:33.030
MATT: That's right, cause you can only
have so many people eat from it.

02:04:33.060 --> 02:04:36.480
Alright, I need Gilmore,
Vax, Vex and Scanlan

02:04:36.510 --> 02:04:39.390
to all make
constitution saving throws.

02:04:39.420 --> 02:04:42.060
SAM: What about Devo'ssa?

02:04:42.090 --> 02:04:44.150
-MATT: Yes.
-TALIESIN: Wow.

02:04:44.180 --> 02:04:46.330
That's not happy.

02:04:46.360 --> 02:04:48.500
Such a pretty die.

02:04:50.390 --> 02:04:52.210
LAURA: Did you say Pike?

02:04:52.240 --> 02:04:53.570
Did you say
Pike as well?

02:04:53.600 --> 02:04:55.270
MATT: Pike didn't
get dispelled.

02:04:55.300 --> 02:04:57.030
So Pike is immune.

02:05:01.570 --> 02:05:03.450
SAM: I got a nine, Matthew.

02:05:03.450 --> 02:05:05.480
-MATT: You got a 9?
-SAM: Constitution?

02:05:05.510 --> 02:05:07.030
-MATT: Yes.
-SAM: Nine.

02:05:07.060 --> 02:05:08.030
MATT: Not you, Percy.

02:05:08.060 --> 02:05:09.840
TALIESIN: I didn't have to roll.

02:05:09.840 --> 02:05:11.570
I'm just mocking him.

02:05:11.600 --> 02:05:13.630
-MATT: Vex?
-LAURA: Fourteen.

02:05:13.660 --> 02:05:15.340
MATT: Okay.

02:05:17.780 --> 02:05:21.630
You guys and Scanlan all suffer
83 points of poison damage.

02:05:21.660 --> 02:05:24.420
TRAVIS: Oh my God!

02:05:24.450 --> 02:05:25.420
MARISHA: How many?

02:05:25.450 --> 02:05:27.620
-MATT: Eighty-three.
-LAURA: Eighty-three.

02:05:29.780 --> 02:05:32.570
MATT: Gilmore.

02:05:32.600 --> 02:05:34.450
TALIESIN: (laughing)

02:05:34.480 --> 02:05:37.870
Gilmore makes his save
roll with a 19 plus three.

02:05:37.870 --> 02:05:40.010
TALIESIN: So, he gets 40.

02:05:40.010 --> 02:05:41.670
MATT: Thanks to your
heal earlier,

02:05:41.670 --> 02:05:43.840
Gilmore is still standing
with two hit points.

02:05:43.840 --> 02:05:46.120
-LAURA: Wow.
-SAM: That makes two of us, friend.

02:05:46.150 --> 02:05:48.660
I'm at two hit
points as well.

02:05:48.690 --> 02:05:50.210
TRAVIS: How y'all doing?

02:05:50.240 --> 02:05:52.750
LAURA: We're unconscious.

02:05:52.780 --> 02:05:53.990
SAM: Did our--

02:05:55.030 --> 02:05:58.060
Our bronze brass dragon
get hurt at all or no?

02:05:58.090 --> 02:06:01.120
MATT: Brass dragon. But it is 
here in a minute.

02:06:01.150 --> 02:06:02.830
Rolls a one on
its saving throw.

02:06:02.830 --> 02:06:05.570
Gonna use legendary resistance
to make the save.

02:06:05.600 --> 02:06:08.840
So he only takes--
they only take--

02:06:08.870 --> 02:06:10.810
TALIESIN: Can you arc lightning?

02:06:10.840 --> 02:06:12.540
MATT: 41 points
of damage there.

02:06:12.570 --> 02:06:14.150
Okay.

02:06:14.180 --> 02:06:16.840
So, as this
billows forth...

02:06:21.540 --> 02:06:25.180
LAURA: Twins go out together.

02:06:25.210 --> 02:06:27.450
MATT: So, Vax, he
falls unconscious.

02:06:27.480 --> 02:06:31.390
Vex, you fall unconscious, fall
off the broom, hit the ground.

02:06:31.420 --> 02:06:33.690
Taking four points
of bludgeoning damage,

02:06:33.720 --> 02:06:35.750
you suffer a death saving
throw from the impact.

02:06:35.780 --> 02:06:37.710
LAURA: From like a teeny
little ten foot fall?

02:06:37.710 --> 02:06:39.270
MATT: 10 foot drop on your head.

02:06:39.300 --> 02:06:41.270
LAURA: That's fucking stupid.

02:06:41.300 --> 02:06:43.240
-MATT: It's only a--
-LAURA: She was sitting stupidly!

02:06:43.270 --> 02:06:44.570
MATT: It's only a d6
bludgeoning damage,

02:06:44.600 --> 02:06:46.030
but when you're
unconscious while falling,

02:06:46.060 --> 02:06:48.940
you now realize the downside
of flying all the time.

02:06:48.940 --> 02:06:49.900
LAURA: Damn it!

02:06:49.900 --> 02:06:51.780
TRAVIS: Didn't you put
air bags on that thing?

02:06:51.780 --> 02:06:53.630
LAURA: I did, I have
a helmet on.

02:06:53.660 --> 02:06:56.300
Did you-- I put
airbags in the witch's hat.

02:06:56.330 --> 02:06:57.510
TALIESIN: It's a football helmet.

02:06:57.540 --> 02:06:59.520
TRAVIS: That's right,
it's magic, it goes...

02:06:59.520 --> 02:07:02.720
SAM: Yeah, I forgot to tell you,
the witch hat is magic.

02:07:02.750 --> 02:07:04.780
TALIESIN: Full of balloons.

02:07:04.810 --> 02:07:06.960
MATT: As the poisonous
breath billows out

02:07:06.960 --> 02:07:09.150
and everyone's coughing
and falling over,

02:07:09.180 --> 02:07:11.060
you watch the twins
fall unconscious,

02:07:11.090 --> 02:07:12.900
Raishan kind of grins.

02:07:15.030 --> 02:07:17.540
"You've got a
few surprises, I see,

02:07:17.570 --> 02:07:20.390
but you're not
the only ones."

02:07:20.420 --> 02:07:23.000
LAURA: Oh, no, does she
have more surprises?

02:07:23.030 --> 02:07:25.010
TRAVIS: I think that's
what she meant, yeah.

02:07:26.390 --> 02:07:28.420
LAURA: I hope that's not--

02:07:28.450 --> 02:07:29.720
TALIESIN: There's cake and
ice cream upstairs.

02:07:29.750 --> 02:07:31.570
SAM: "I have more surprises."

02:07:31.600 --> 02:07:33.780
"Guys, I think she
has more surprises."

02:07:34.520 --> 02:07:36.630
TRAVIS: That's literally
what she just said.

02:07:36.660 --> 02:07:39.330
LAURA: I just thought maybe
the breath was the surprise.

02:07:39.360 --> 02:07:43.750
MATT: And then is going to use
the rest of her movement

02:07:43.780 --> 02:07:45.600
to whip over here.

02:07:48.510 --> 02:07:50.840
TRAVIS: Damn it, damn it, damn it.

02:07:50.870 --> 02:07:52.180
Why'd she have to leave?

02:07:52.210 --> 02:07:53.900
I just wanted to
give her a high five.

02:07:53.900 --> 02:07:56.280
TALIESIN: You need to heal the living
hell out of these people.

02:07:56.280 --> 02:07:57.030
LAURA: Damn it!

02:07:57.060 --> 02:07:58.120
She's carrying...?

02:07:58.150 --> 02:08:00.300
MATT: She's carrying
two eggs underneath.

02:08:00.330 --> 02:08:01.840
TALIESIN: Which means she obviously
can't do claw attacks.

02:08:01.840 --> 02:08:03.420
MATT: She still has
40 feet of movement.

02:08:03.450 --> 02:08:04.810
LAURA: That's true.

02:08:04.840 --> 02:08:08.180
MATT: And is going
to turn back,

02:08:09.300 --> 02:08:11.350
and flies there.

02:08:13.460 --> 02:08:15.270
TRAVIS: Didn't pick up
anything else?

02:08:15.300 --> 02:08:18.000
MATT: No, she grabbed the
two eggs and is positioning.

02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:22.140
Alright, that ends
Raishan's turn.

02:08:22.810 --> 02:08:24.420
Keyleth, you're up.

02:08:24.450 --> 02:08:26.120
TALIESIN: Can you heal?

02:08:26.150 --> 02:08:28.170
MARISHA: I'm wondering if
I should drop this

02:08:28.170 --> 02:08:30.000
and start doing
beefier stuff now.

02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:31.120
LAURA: Yeah.

02:08:31.150 --> 02:08:32.750
MARISHA: I think now's the time.

02:08:32.780 --> 02:08:37.660
SAM: This has only injured
Vax so far, so...

02:08:37.690 --> 02:08:38.780
LAURA: Me and...

02:08:38.810 --> 02:08:40.380
TALIESIN: The twins, they're
both unconscious.

02:08:40.380 --> 02:08:41.270
SAM: Oh, great.

02:08:41.300 --> 02:08:43.830
TALIESIN: With one death saving
throw already failed.

02:08:43.830 --> 02:08:45.060
SAM: Great.

02:08:45.090 --> 02:08:46.630
LAURA: No, just me.

02:08:46.660 --> 02:08:51.090
MARISHA: Okay, I am going
to move from--

02:08:51.120 --> 02:08:53.150
LAURA: And Pike's like out.

02:08:53.180 --> 02:08:57.630
MARISHA: Over the
lava like this direction.

02:08:57.660 --> 02:08:59.300
SAM: She's got some cantrips.

02:08:59.330 --> 02:09:01.060
MARISHA: Geez, I can't tell.

02:09:01.090 --> 02:09:03.080
-MATT: Which way?
-MARISHA: This way, this way.

02:09:03.080 --> 02:09:05.120
See the laser pointer?
No, no, no, I had it.

02:09:05.150 --> 02:09:06.780
I had it and
it went away.

02:09:06.810 --> 02:09:08.720
-Okay.
-MATT: Over here?

02:09:08.750 --> 02:09:10.570
MARISHA: No, it's--
yeah, over there.

02:09:10.600 --> 02:09:13.180
-MATT: Over here?
-MARISHA: Uh-huh.

02:09:13.210 --> 02:09:15.450
And how far away is
Raishan from me now?

02:09:15.480 --> 02:09:17.810
MATT: I'd say roughly
30 feet, 35 feet.

02:09:17.840 --> 02:09:20.530
MARISHA: Okay, move
me like one more closer to her.

02:09:20.530 --> 02:09:21.750
MATT: There you go.

02:09:21.750 --> 02:09:24.750
MARISHA: And how close am I 
from the twins now?

02:09:24.750 --> 02:09:26.180
I can't see.

02:09:26.210 --> 02:09:28.120
MATT: Twins, you're about 30,
another 35 feet from them.

02:09:28.150 --> 02:09:29.660
MARISHA: Okay, let me move
five more feet

02:09:29.690 --> 02:09:31.180
so I can be within
30 feet of the twins.

02:09:31.210 --> 02:09:32.480
MATT: Okay.

02:09:32.510 --> 02:09:34.060
MARISHA: Okay, now I'm
gonna drop my--

02:09:34.090 --> 02:09:36.180
MATT: Well, with both twins,
you'd have to move there.

02:09:36.210 --> 02:09:37.210
You drop your form?

02:09:37.240 --> 02:09:38.660
-MARISHA: Drop my form.
-MATT: Alright.

02:09:38.690 --> 02:09:40.060
MARISHA: I hope this is not
a terrible idea.

02:09:40.090 --> 02:09:41.810
-MATT: I'll put you there.
-TALIESIN: We're at that point.

02:09:41.840 --> 02:09:43.630
MARISHA: We're at that point.

02:09:43.660 --> 02:09:45.720
This is Dungeons
and Dragons!

02:09:45.750 --> 02:09:49.150
TALIESIN: This is dungeon
and dragons.

02:09:49.180 --> 02:09:53.540
MARISHA: I'm going to bust out
the Spire of Conflux.

02:09:55.360 --> 02:09:58.810
So I'm gonna bust out the staff
and be like, "You bitch."

02:09:58.840 --> 02:10:00.150
And then aim it.

02:10:00.180 --> 02:10:03.450
I'm gonna do chain lightning

02:10:03.480 --> 02:10:07.120
and can I try and
hit her and the two eggs

02:10:07.150 --> 02:10:09.630
and maybe like, since
I still have the storm going,

02:10:09.660 --> 02:10:11.540
like, it just looks cool?

02:10:12.950 --> 02:10:14.540
(laughing)

02:10:14.540 --> 02:10:16.300
MATT: Sure.

02:10:16.330 --> 02:10:18.480
LAURA: Doesn't it--?

02:10:18.510 --> 02:10:20.360
MATT: Raishan saves.

02:10:20.390 --> 02:10:22.270
The eggs cannot
save technically,

02:10:22.270 --> 02:10:23.810
so go ahead
and roll damage.

02:10:23.810 --> 02:10:26.210
LAURA: Don't you get the
lightning attacks too?

02:10:26.240 --> 02:10:27.570
If you're doing
chain lightning,

02:10:27.600 --> 02:10:29.570
you still get the other
lightning's that are there?

02:10:29.600 --> 02:10:31.870
MARISHA: I have to choose
to make an action.

02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:33.780
It's still there,

02:10:33.810 --> 02:10:36.660
but I can either like do other
things or choose to do--

02:10:36.660 --> 02:10:38.150
LAURA: I understand.

02:10:42.300 --> 02:10:45.180
MARISHA: Sorry, I don't
do the-- 10d8.

02:10:45.210 --> 02:10:47.230
TALIESIN: Do you need some d8's?

02:10:47.230 --> 02:10:49.200
MARISHA: I have one, two,
three, four, five...

02:10:49.200 --> 02:10:50.850
I think I'm good,
I'll just roll five twice.

02:10:50.850 --> 02:10:52.540
Oh, God, oh, God.

02:10:52.570 --> 02:10:53.720
Did she save?

02:10:53.750 --> 02:10:55.480
MATT: Yes, she did.

02:10:55.510 --> 02:10:56.870
MARISHA: But the eggs didn't?

02:10:56.870 --> 02:10:58.060
MATT: The eggs did not.

02:10:58.090 --> 02:11:01.420
MARISHA: Okay, that's not
phenomenal.

02:11:01.450 --> 02:11:05.300
Three, six, nine,
ten-- nine, ten, eleven.

02:11:05.330 --> 02:11:09.180
Plus four is 15 plus...

02:11:11.330 --> 02:11:12.990
Okay, okay.

02:11:14.780 --> 02:11:16.300
What'd I say, 15?

02:11:16.330 --> 02:11:18.970
Twenty-five, 29.

02:11:20.300 --> 02:11:21.660
Thirty-six total.

02:11:21.690 --> 02:11:23.330
TALIESIN: Oh, wait, wait, wait.

02:11:23.330 --> 02:11:25.060
MARISHA: Oh!

02:11:25.090 --> 02:11:26.690
Oh, and I get to
reroll this one.

02:11:26.720 --> 02:11:29.000
Thirty-six, no,
thirty-eight.

02:11:29.030 --> 02:11:33.270
MATT: Thirty-eight, okay.

02:11:33.300 --> 02:11:37.840
That would be 29,
no, sorry.

02:11:37.870 --> 02:11:40.390
No, from 30, 19.

02:11:40.420 --> 02:11:42.720
Nineteen damage to Raishan
and the two eggs--

02:11:42.750 --> 02:11:44.510
You watch as the bolt hits,

02:11:44.540 --> 02:11:47.290
arcs through her,
arcs through the eggs.

02:11:47.290 --> 02:11:49.330
You see the eggs still
carrying them, no visual.

02:11:49.330 --> 02:11:51.180
MARISHA: It didn't do
anything to 'em?

02:11:51.180 --> 02:11:52.830
MATT: Well, nothing
you can see, no.

02:11:52.830 --> 02:11:54.480
MARISHA: Nothing I can see.

02:11:54.510 --> 02:11:56.300
Maybe I like
microwaved 'em inside.

02:11:56.330 --> 02:11:57.390
Like nuked 'em.

02:11:57.420 --> 02:11:59.270
Might have nuked 'em.

02:11:59.300 --> 02:12:02.030
TRAVIS: Might have been like Vision
and you made 'em super strong.

02:12:02.030 --> 02:12:04.620
MARISHA: Yeah, or I turned 'em into
little Vision dragons.

02:12:04.620 --> 02:12:06.390
You know,
one of the two.

02:12:06.420 --> 02:12:08.600
Okay, and then
for my bonus action,

02:12:08.630 --> 02:12:12.030
I'm going to do a
Healing Word on Vax.

02:12:12.060 --> 02:12:13.100
MATT: Okay.

02:12:16.030 --> 02:12:20.660
MARISHA: I'm just gonna
do it at first level.

02:12:20.690 --> 02:12:22.780
-Sorry.
-LIAM: No, hey.

02:12:22.810 --> 02:12:24.240
TALIESIN: It's back up.

02:12:27.300 --> 02:12:29.270
MARISHA: Three plus (indistinguishable)
so nine total.

02:12:29.300 --> 02:12:31.780
LIAM: Thank you.

02:12:31.810 --> 02:12:34.080
MATT: At the end of your turn,

02:12:36.270 --> 02:12:38.540
watching you form over,
hit her with lightning,

02:12:38.570 --> 02:12:41.510
hit the eggs
and all of a sudden,

02:12:41.540 --> 02:12:45.360
breath come back to the
lungs of Vax on the ground.

02:12:45.390 --> 02:12:48.020
Raishan, "Not so fast."

02:12:48.020 --> 02:12:49.360
Still clutching the eggs,

02:12:49.390 --> 02:12:52.480
her front claws kind
of form this small spiral

02:12:52.510 --> 02:12:54.840
as the air grows
surprisingly cold

02:12:54.870 --> 02:12:57.660
causing this mist to form

02:12:57.690 --> 02:13:00.780
around the extended
ends of her claws.

02:13:00.810 --> 02:13:04.210
As she puts
her arms forth,

02:13:04.240 --> 02:13:06.600
casting Cone of Cold
outward from her.

02:13:06.630 --> 02:13:10.180
LAURA: I wonder if they're elemental,
like, amplifiers.

02:13:10.210 --> 02:13:11.240
MARISHA: The eggs?

02:13:11.270 --> 02:13:13.090
TALIESIN: I think, I think
maybe they're--

02:13:13.120 --> 02:13:14.570
TRAVIS: Just eggs?

02:13:14.600 --> 02:13:17.300
TALIESIN: No, no, I think she
may be on to something.

02:13:17.330 --> 02:13:19.510
MATT: That's going to be...

02:13:19.510 --> 02:13:21.120
I don't know if
it's going to hit.

02:13:21.150 --> 02:13:22.210
TALIESIN: No, no.

02:13:22.240 --> 02:13:23.840
MATT: Does not hit Gilmore.

02:13:23.870 --> 02:13:25.510
However, I need Scanlan...

02:13:25.540 --> 02:13:28.750
SAM: Would I be able to
counter spell this or--

02:13:28.780 --> 02:13:32.780
or am I already in a cloud
of smoke and coughing?

02:13:32.810 --> 02:13:36.330
MATT: Oh, you can't
technically move

02:13:36.360 --> 02:13:38.090
cause you're
doubled over.

02:13:38.090 --> 02:13:39.630
SAM: I'm already in
the cloud, right?

02:13:39.660 --> 02:13:41.030
-MATT: Yeah.
-SAM: Okay.

02:13:41.060 --> 02:13:43.780
LAURA: You're in the cloud,
but you can be restored.

02:13:43.810 --> 02:13:45.220
Cause you've
been backed up.

02:13:45.220 --> 02:13:46.110
SAM: Oh. Backblaze?

02:13:46.110 --> 02:13:48.180
SAM: You're slowly becoming 
me tonight.

02:13:48.180 --> 02:13:49.820
TALIESIN: Can Gilmore
dispel or--

02:13:50.750 --> 02:13:53.330
Just throwing
that out there.

02:13:53.360 --> 02:13:55.700
I know you're
playing a lot of hands here.

02:13:56.690 --> 02:13:59.560
SAM: You're so handsome and
charming all of a sudden.

02:14:02.180 --> 02:14:03.840
MATT: What's the range on that?

02:14:06.930 --> 02:14:09.360
Unfortunately, Gilmore's
just out of range. 60 foot range.

02:14:09.390 --> 02:14:11.970
TALIESIN: Goddammit, okay.

02:14:11.970 --> 02:14:13.660
MATT: Good looking out though.

02:14:13.690 --> 02:14:15.180
TALIESIN: I'm trying.

02:14:15.210 --> 02:14:18.000
MATT: So that is Kima,
Pike, J'Mon,

02:14:18.030 --> 02:14:20.210
Scanlan, Vax and Vex

02:14:20.240 --> 02:14:22.570
all making constitution
saving throws.

02:14:22.600 --> 02:14:23.840
LAURA: I'm unconscious.

02:14:23.870 --> 02:14:26.050
MATT: So, you take
another death save.

02:14:26.050 --> 02:14:27.780
-LAURA: Cool.
-TALIESIN: Goddammit.

02:14:27.810 --> 02:14:29.660
We need to fix that.

02:14:29.690 --> 02:14:32.870
LAURA: I've got one save left.

02:14:33.000 --> 02:14:34.750
TALIESIN: Please, we got
to fix that.

02:14:37.840 --> 02:14:40.300
SAM: Did I-- wait.

02:14:40.330 --> 02:14:44.260
Vax-y poo, did I give
you my cold armor?

02:14:44.260 --> 02:14:45.530
I mean, Vex-y poo.

02:14:45.530 --> 02:14:47.770
LAURA: Yeah, you did,
but it's not attuned.

02:14:47.770 --> 02:14:49.810
SAM: You're not
even using it?

02:14:49.810 --> 02:14:52.060
MATT: And even then, even at half
damage, she's unconscious.

02:14:52.090 --> 02:14:54.450
LAURA: Well, I am, I'm
just not getting cold--

02:14:54.480 --> 02:14:56.870
MATT: So you're at two
death saves on impact.

02:14:57.000 --> 02:15:00.150
You're unconscious
again to zero.

02:15:00.180 --> 02:15:02.450
-You take...
-SAM: I rolled an 11.

02:15:02.480 --> 02:15:03.840
MATT: An eleven, yeah.

02:15:03.870 --> 02:15:06.690
So you take 43 points of cold damage.

02:15:06.720 --> 02:15:08.180
SAM: I'm so dead.

02:15:08.210 --> 02:15:09.330
TRAVIS: No, no, unconscious.

02:15:09.360 --> 02:15:10.750
-MATT: Unconscious.
-LAURA: You're unconscious.

02:15:10.780 --> 02:15:12.030
SAM: Negative 41.

02:15:12.060 --> 02:15:13.180
MATT: Both roll for Pike.

02:15:13.210 --> 02:15:15.630
LAURA: It doesn't matter
what you're negative.

02:15:15.660 --> 02:15:16.660
TRAVIS: Unless it's your
total hit points.

02:15:16.690 --> 02:15:17.690
LAURA: Yeah.

02:15:17.720 --> 02:15:19.120
MATT: Roll for Pike if
you could please.

02:15:19.120 --> 02:15:20.690
LAURA: Well,
I wouldn't count it,

02:15:20.720 --> 02:15:22.420
but yeah, that was--
that was bad.

02:15:22.450 --> 02:15:23.510
It was better when I--

02:15:23.540 --> 02:15:26.570
TALIESIN: Well, not anymore.

02:15:26.600 --> 02:15:28.120
LAURA: What is this,
what is this?

02:15:28.150 --> 02:15:30.240
Constitution,
what is this?

02:15:30.270 --> 02:15:31.660
Five!

02:15:31.690 --> 02:15:33.060
Cause I suck.

02:15:33.090 --> 02:15:35.030
MATT: Pike takes another
43 points of cold damage.

02:15:35.060 --> 02:15:36.810
LAURA: Pike is unconscious.

02:15:36.840 --> 02:15:38.420
SAM: The gnomes are down.

02:15:38.450 --> 02:15:40.240
Well, at least
we got Kima.

02:15:40.270 --> 02:15:41.480
LAURA: Whoa.

02:15:41.510 --> 02:15:44.510
The two-- the twins
and the gnomes are out.

02:15:44.540 --> 02:15:46.570
SAM: Yeah, whoa,
we're down four?

02:15:46.600 --> 02:15:47.930
TALIESIN: We're down four.

02:15:47.930 --> 02:15:50.870
-SAM: Whoa!
-LAURA: This is serious, you guys.

02:15:51.000 --> 02:15:53.030
SAM: Don't worry, Devo'ssa's here

02:15:53.060 --> 02:15:57.150
to give one shot of
28 points of damage.

02:15:57.180 --> 02:15:59.270
Come on, Devo'ssa,
do something!

02:15:59.300 --> 02:16:01.890
TRAVIS: I would hit the dragon
cause it's low enough,

02:16:01.890 --> 02:16:03.910
but it's on the
other side of the map.

02:16:04.570 --> 02:16:07.580
MATT: Alrighty, so that's the
end of Keyleth's turn.

02:16:08.480 --> 02:16:10.270
It's now Gilmore's turn.

02:16:12.600 --> 02:16:14.540
TRAVIS: Come on, Gilmore.

02:16:14.570 --> 02:16:17.390
LAURA: Do you have
Mass Cure, Gilmore?

02:16:17.390 --> 02:16:19.600
MATT: Gilmore does not
cure, unfortunately,

02:16:19.630 --> 02:16:22.300
that's not
his specialty.

02:16:22.330 --> 02:16:23.960
TRAVIS: What about Razzle Dazzle?

02:16:23.960 --> 02:16:25.730
MATT: He's used a
lot of his spells.

02:16:28.420 --> 02:16:29.970
(sighs)

02:16:31.021 --> 02:16:32.300
TALIESIN: I have nothing.

02:16:32.300 --> 02:16:33.570
TRAVIS: Can he cast like--

02:16:33.570 --> 02:16:35.660
SAM: Oh, wait!

02:16:35.690 --> 02:16:36.780
Shit.

02:16:36.809 --> 02:16:38.520
No, that was poison.

02:16:38.520 --> 02:16:40.660
He shot-- Raishan shot
poison at us, right?

02:16:40.690 --> 02:16:41.660
TALIESIN: No, cold.

02:16:41.690 --> 02:16:43.209
LAURA: Cold the last time.

02:16:43.240 --> 02:16:44.360
SAM: No, the cold this time.

02:16:44.389 --> 02:16:45.990
The previous time
it was poison.

02:16:45.990 --> 02:16:47.240
MATT: Yes.

02:16:47.270 --> 02:16:48.570
SAM: Never acid though.

02:16:48.570 --> 02:16:50.299
TALIESIN: No, never acid.

02:16:50.330 --> 02:16:52.000
MATT: Gilmore rushes around J'Mon

02:16:52.030 --> 02:16:53.659
almost as a
defensive stand point,

02:16:53.659 --> 02:16:55.810
but also kind of taking
in the circumstance.

02:16:55.810 --> 02:16:57.870
Watching this blast of
cold air come through.

02:16:57.870 --> 02:17:00.330
Kind of looks around, seeing
everyone on the ground.

02:17:00.360 --> 02:17:02.360
It's like,
"Oh God, oh God."

02:17:02.389 --> 02:17:05.870
And in a fit of rage and
needing to lock this down,

02:17:06.000 --> 02:17:09.240
just gonna go ahead with what
he has left at his disposal

02:17:09.270 --> 02:17:11.719
to release a...

02:17:16.270 --> 02:17:18.309

Beautiful.

actions from Raishan.

She has four,

greenish dart
of arcane energy

is enlarged-ish.

02:25:11.540 --> 02:25:12.710
TRAVIS: No, no, no, no.

02:25:12.710 --> 02:25:14.350
-MARISHA: Come on, man.
-TRAVIS: I don't believe it.

02:25:14.350 --> 02:25:16.000
-MARISHA: Come on!
-TRAVIS: I don't believe.

02:25:16.030 --> 02:25:17.420
SAM: Look at all the notes,
look at all the notes.

02:25:17.450 --> 02:25:19.090
TRAVIS: I don't believe it!

02:25:19.120 --> 02:25:20.360
MATT: Three, two and one.

02:25:20.360 --> 02:25:21.860
That is ridiculous.

02:25:21.860 --> 02:25:23.720
LAURA: You know why
this happened?

02:25:23.750 --> 02:25:25.260
Cause you took
so long to call--

02:25:25.260 --> 02:25:26.870
SAM: Yeah, I know, I know.

02:25:27.000 --> 02:25:28.180
They got--
they got bored

02:25:28.210 --> 02:25:32.240
waiting at home and yeah.

02:25:32.270 --> 02:25:35.270
-MATT: So.
-SAM: It's me, it's on me.

02:25:35.300 --> 02:25:37.330
MATT: As J'Mon rushes up
and unleashes, Raishan,

02:25:37.360 --> 02:25:41.090
who is slippery
at best, and really,

02:25:41.120 --> 02:25:44.240
really, really creepily
deceitful at her worst,

02:25:44.270 --> 02:25:46.030
dodges to the side,
so, she's in the shadows

02:25:46.060 --> 02:25:48.390
and the cloud of
the storm in the air

02:25:48.420 --> 02:25:50.390
to kind of hide her form

02:25:50.420 --> 02:25:54.570
as J'Mon reaches out
and starts slashing Raishan,

02:25:54.600 --> 02:25:57.060
who's now has this kind
of wild look in her eyes

02:25:57.090 --> 02:25:58.720
of now mounting victory.

02:25:58.750 --> 02:26:00.660
From a moment
of fear earlier,

02:26:00.690 --> 02:26:02.720
she manages to avoid
the first two strikes

02:26:02.750 --> 02:26:04.270
and the third one,

02:26:04.300 --> 02:26:06.540
the tail slaps against
the side of Raishan's body.

02:26:06.570 --> 02:26:08.210
Whack and smacks
to no effect.

02:26:08.240 --> 02:26:10.180
TRAVIS: Jesus.

02:26:10.210 --> 02:26:12.390
MATT: That ends
J'Mon's turn.

02:26:12.420 --> 02:26:13.570
It is now
Pike's turn.

02:26:13.600 --> 02:26:14.690
LIAM: Pike, how close
is she to--

02:26:14.720 --> 02:26:17.300
-SAM: Book!
-TALIESIN: Book?

02:26:17.330 --> 02:26:20.810
MATT: Pike is about
25 feet away.

02:26:20.840 --> 02:26:22.600
LIAM: She's gonna run
up, kneel down,

02:26:22.630 --> 02:26:25.810
wait, kiss Vex on
the forehead, and say,

02:26:25.840 --> 02:26:27.240
"Not like this, buddy,"

02:26:27.270 --> 02:26:31.000
and cast Revivify
for her last spell.

02:26:31.030 --> 02:26:32.690
TRAVIS: It is her last.

02:26:32.720 --> 02:26:34.330
MATT: Revivify is touch

02:26:34.360 --> 02:26:37.060
and she's coming up
from unconscious prone

02:26:37.090 --> 02:26:38.180
which means she
doesn't have the movement

02:26:38.210 --> 02:26:39.270
to get there to touch her.

02:26:39.300 --> 02:26:40.480
LIAM: Pike is unconscious?

02:26:40.510 --> 02:26:41.870
MATT: Oh, no, she was--
she was--

02:26:42.000 --> 02:26:42.870
TRAVIS: Pike was not
unconscious.

02:26:43.000 --> 02:26:44.210
MARISHA: She was not
unconscious, she was up.

02:26:44.240 --> 02:26:45.630
TRAVIS: She was up
with 15--

02:26:45.660 --> 02:26:47.510
MATT: Oh, oh.

02:26:47.540 --> 02:26:49.210
LAURA: She had 15.

02:26:49.240 --> 02:26:50.870
-But she was--
-SAM: She was lying down.

02:26:51.000 --> 02:26:52.210
-LAURA: She was lying on--
-MATT: So, she was prone.

02:26:52.240 --> 02:26:53.450
She was prone.

02:26:53.480 --> 02:26:55.090
TRAVIS: Oh, why didn't I
just pick her up?

02:26:55.120 --> 02:26:56.390
MATT: No, so she can move.

02:26:56.420 --> 02:26:58.270
She can't get there.

02:26:58.300 --> 02:26:59.270
LAURA: That's okay.

02:26:59.300 --> 02:27:02.510
MATT: It's a touch spell.

02:27:02.540 --> 02:27:04.630
LIAM: Who's she near?

02:27:04.660 --> 02:27:06.660
MARISHA: How much time does
Revivify need?

02:27:06.690 --> 02:27:07.660
LAURA: A minute.

02:27:07.690 --> 02:27:09.570
TALIESIN: Oh, under
a minute.

02:27:09.600 --> 02:27:11.570
Oh, well, she
can make her way--

02:27:11.600 --> 02:27:13.360
LAURA: She's got
Sprinter's Boots on!

02:27:13.390 --> 02:27:15.810
She just texted.

02:27:15.840 --> 02:27:17.510
MATT: Had she used
them recently?

02:27:17.540 --> 02:27:19.270
LAURA: We didn't use them
in the last fight

02:27:19.300 --> 02:27:20.720
because we didn't
realize she had 'em.

02:27:20.750 --> 02:27:22.480
MATT: The internet
will let us know.

02:27:22.510 --> 02:27:24.490
LAURA: Well, I-- we didn't use 'em
in the fight with Thordak.

02:27:24.490 --> 02:27:26.150
LIAM: She didn't know she had
'em so we didn't use 'em.

02:27:26.180 --> 02:27:27.270
MATT: Right, right, so.

02:27:27.300 --> 02:27:29.240
SAM: Do you have any
other healing spells

02:27:29.270 --> 02:27:30.480
that can work
at a distance?

02:27:30.510 --> 02:27:32.090
-LIAM: She's dead.
-MARISHA: She's dead.

02:27:32.120 --> 02:27:33.120
She's gonna
do Revivify.

02:27:33.150 --> 02:27:35.060
-LAURA: For Pike, though.
-TALIESIN: Yeah, like.

02:27:35.090 --> 02:27:36.810
LIAM: So the Sprinter's Boots do
nothing, I mean, I don't know.

02:27:36.840 --> 02:27:38.300
MATT: The Sprinter's Boots will
let her double her movement

02:27:38.330 --> 02:27:39.510
for a round.

02:27:39.540 --> 02:27:41.360
LIAM: So will she get there?

02:27:41.390 --> 02:27:44.530
LAURA: She's writing in all caps
"Sprinter's Boots!"

02:27:44.530 --> 02:27:45.870
(laughing)

02:27:45.870 --> 02:27:47.240
LIAM: Alright, so Revivify.

02:27:47.270 --> 02:27:49.210
-MATT: Alright.
-TALIESIN: Oh my God.

02:27:49.240 --> 02:27:51.630
MATT: Now, this is mid-combat.

02:27:53.630 --> 02:27:56.540
-For the purposes of this--
-LAURA: Oh God.

02:28:00.460 --> 02:28:02.180
SAM: How long does
it take to cast?

02:28:02.210 --> 02:28:04.030
LIAM: It's instantaneous.

02:28:04.060 --> 02:28:05.420
TALIESIN: Less than six seconds.

02:28:05.450 --> 02:28:07.210
LIAM: One action,
instantaneous.

02:28:07.240 --> 02:28:09.690
MARISHA: Yeah, she did lay out
less than six seconds, man.

02:28:09.720 --> 02:28:11.120
MATT: I understand.

02:28:12.720 --> 02:28:17.660
So, this-- this is going to
be a rapid resurrection skill check.

02:28:17.690 --> 02:28:19.360
LAURA: Oh God, really? Okay.

02:28:20.920 --> 02:28:22.720
MATT: So, but this is
only from Pike

02:28:22.750 --> 02:28:24.380
because it is
a singular roll.

02:28:27.150 --> 02:28:27.910
So.

02:28:29.030 --> 02:28:32.540
LAURA: Can Ashley roll, do you
want to roll Ashley?

02:28:32.570 --> 02:28:36.480
MATT: As Pike rushes up,
what does Pike utilize

02:28:36.510 --> 02:28:40.750
to implore Vex's
soul to return?

02:28:40.780 --> 02:28:42.480
SAM: Liam, you answer.

02:28:42.510 --> 02:28:48.630
♪

02:28:48.660 --> 02:28:50.660
LIAM: My gosh.

02:28:55.330 --> 02:28:58.600
She grabs a dagger
out of Vex's belt

02:28:58.630 --> 02:29:02.030
and cuts off a
lock of her hair

02:29:02.060 --> 02:29:05.360
and presses it
into Vex's hand.

02:29:05.390 --> 02:29:08.780
"It's not time,
it's not time for you.

02:29:08.810 --> 02:29:10.120
No."

02:29:10.150 --> 02:29:18.150
♪

02:29:18.180 --> 02:29:20.030
MATT: Go ahead and just roll a d20.

02:29:20.060 --> 02:29:21.990
LAURA: She's-- oh!

02:29:23.240 --> 02:29:24.300
Oh, no!

02:29:24.330 --> 02:29:25.570
Should we read that?

02:29:25.570 --> 02:29:27.000
TRAVIS: No.

02:29:27.030 --> 02:29:29.540
MATT: A ten?

02:29:29.570 --> 02:29:33.240
As the glow from
the outside of her form

02:29:33.270 --> 02:29:35.810
that just radiates
with the armor itself,

02:29:35.840 --> 02:29:38.420
centrally focuses itself
into her holy symbol

02:29:38.450 --> 02:29:40.300
and is sent down the arm.

02:29:40.330 --> 02:29:41.850
Each piece of
the plate mail

02:29:41.850 --> 02:29:43.480
glowing in succession

02:29:43.510 --> 02:29:45.240
like a series
of chained lights

02:29:45.270 --> 02:29:46.630
as it reaches the fingers,

02:29:46.660 --> 02:29:50.870
touching the bottom of her
fingertips to Vex's torso.

02:29:52.390 --> 02:29:56.420
The air seems to go dark
for a moment around her body

02:29:56.450 --> 02:29:58.510
before it pulses,
and with that,

02:29:58.540 --> 02:30:01.720
you watch as her jaw
moves ever so slightly

02:30:01.750 --> 02:30:05.420
taking in, once more, the
warm air of Thordak's lair.

02:30:05.450 --> 02:30:07.210
MARISHA: No one else die.

02:30:09.920 --> 02:30:11.690
MATT: Pike, want to do
anything else?

02:30:11.720 --> 02:30:13.360
Bonus action?

02:30:14.360 --> 02:30:16.000
LIAM: Geez, I don't--

02:30:16.030 --> 02:30:18.460
LAURA: Oh, she should take-- she should
take a potion or something.

02:30:18.460 --> 02:30:20.120
TRAVIS: Yeah, heal herself please.

02:30:20.150 --> 02:30:22.450
LAURA: She's got a--
she's got a Greater healing--

02:30:22.480 --> 02:30:25.730
Pike has a Greater healing
potion that I know of.

02:30:27.000 --> 02:30:28.000
So she can take it.

02:30:28.000 --> 02:30:29.120
MATT: Okay.

02:30:29.150 --> 02:30:31.300
So that is a
4d4 plus four.

02:30:31.330 --> 02:30:32.450
TRAVIS: This sucks!

02:30:32.480 --> 02:30:33.690
TALIESIN: I'm almost
of the thinking

02:30:33.720 --> 02:30:35.150
that she shouldn't
take it just because--

02:30:35.180 --> 02:30:37.380
-Well, no, she's got--
-LAURA: She's got 15 points.

02:30:37.380 --> 02:30:39.120
TALIESIN: Well, I mean, but
anything hits her--

02:30:39.150 --> 02:30:41.040
half the things that hit her
are gonna even kill that

02:30:41.040 --> 02:30:42.510
and that's a
revive from death.

02:30:42.510 --> 02:30:43.600
LAURA: That's true.

02:30:43.630 --> 02:30:46.540
MARISHA: Yeah, but it's
on her, right?

02:30:46.570 --> 02:30:48.360
Yeah, I see what
you mean though.

02:30:48.390 --> 02:30:49.660
LAURA: Should she wait,
should she hold it?

02:30:49.690 --> 02:30:51.340
SAM: They're in control of her.

02:30:51.340 --> 02:30:53.140
TALIESIN: Yeah, you do it,
you do it, you do it.

02:30:53.140 --> 02:30:55.300
I'm overthinking this.

02:30:55.330 --> 02:30:57.120
LIAM: Yeah, we're talking about
getting people back up.

02:30:57.150 --> 02:31:00.390
At this point, not healing
cause any hit is lethal.

02:31:00.420 --> 02:31:02.000
So getting someone
on their feet.

02:31:02.030 --> 02:31:04.540
TRAVIS: I got some potions
cause I never use 'em, but...

02:31:04.540 --> 02:31:06.630
MATT: Yeah, you guys have been
hording potions for a while.

02:31:06.660 --> 02:31:08.750
You've been burning
through all of them

02:31:08.780 --> 02:31:10.390
from these
two encounters.

02:31:10.420 --> 02:31:12.150
TRAVIS: I've got all the
ones I've never used.

02:31:12.180 --> 02:31:13.600
LIAM: Who's on the
ground by Grog?

02:31:13.630 --> 02:31:14.690
TALIESIN: You.

02:31:14.720 --> 02:31:17.210
LIAM: No, I know I am, but
who else is that?

02:31:17.240 --> 02:31:18.660
TALIESIN: It's Scanlan, Scanlan's
on the ground still.

02:31:18.690 --> 02:31:21.690
LIAM: Is someone up besides me?

02:31:21.720 --> 02:31:23.540
LAURA: Well, I want-- it's
an action if she--

02:31:23.570 --> 02:31:25.030
if she gives it
to anybody else.

02:31:25.060 --> 02:31:27.330
She can't, she can only take it
as a bonus action for herself.

02:31:27.360 --> 02:31:31.120
-TRAVIS: Go.
-LIAM: Go.

02:31:31.150 --> 02:31:33.840
LAURA: Oh, that's really
good though.

02:31:33.870 --> 02:31:36.510
MARISHA: I wonder how bad
Raishan is looking.

02:31:36.540 --> 02:31:38.330
TALIESIN: He hasn't said the phrase.

02:31:38.330 --> 02:31:40.600
-LAURA: Nineteen.
-MATT: Okay, nice.

02:31:40.630 --> 02:31:44.840
Alright, at the end of Pike's
turn, Devo'ssa, J'Mon Sa Ord,

02:31:44.870 --> 02:31:46.270
is gonna use two
legendary actions

02:31:46.300 --> 02:31:47.630
to attempt a
wing attack.

02:31:47.660 --> 02:31:48.720
TALIESIN: Thank God.

02:31:48.750 --> 02:31:50.180
TRAVIS: Come on, come on.

02:31:50.210 --> 02:31:52.750
MATT: He is now like just
assailing Raishan

02:31:52.780 --> 02:31:56.000
with their wings.

02:31:56.030 --> 02:32:00.510
So, Raishan has to make a
dexterity saving throw.

02:32:00.540 --> 02:32:03.570
That is cocked, try again.

02:32:03.600 --> 02:32:05.840
No, that is a failure.

02:32:05.870 --> 02:32:08.540
Raishan's gonna use the
last legendary resistance

02:32:08.570 --> 02:32:09.780
to resist that.

02:32:09.810 --> 02:32:11.780
So instead takes...

02:32:11.810 --> 02:32:15.540
TRAVIS: Fuck!

02:32:15.570 --> 02:32:17.150
MATT: That's...

02:32:17.180 --> 02:32:19.330
MARISHA: She's burned through all
of her legendary resistance?

02:32:19.360 --> 02:32:22.420
MATT: Seven points of bludgeoning
damage and is not knocked prone.

02:32:22.450 --> 02:32:24.540
That would have
messed her up.

02:32:24.570 --> 02:32:25.660
Okay.

02:32:25.690 --> 02:32:27.180
TRAVIS: Is not knocked prone?

02:32:27.210 --> 02:32:28.810
MATT: No, she is not,
she's safe.

02:32:28.840 --> 02:32:32.180
Okay, that brings
us to Scanlan.

02:32:32.210 --> 02:32:35.420
LAURA: We just gotta
get out of here.

02:32:35.450 --> 02:32:37.330
SAM: Fail.

02:32:37.360 --> 02:32:40.390
MATT: That's a death
saving throw off Scanlan.

02:32:40.420 --> 02:32:42.390
Alrighty, that brings us
to the top of the round.

02:32:42.420 --> 02:32:45.850
Percy, you are in
the back of a wall.

02:32:47.000 --> 02:32:48.600
TALIESIN: I'm taking...

02:32:49.540 --> 02:32:53.240
MATT: The curse of the unscathed!

02:32:53.270 --> 02:32:56.340
TALIESIN: You know, I was gonna take shots
at the eggs, but I give up.

02:32:56.340 --> 02:32:58.420
I'm taking just
shots at Raishan.

02:32:58.450 --> 02:33:00.390
MATT: Okay, go for it.

02:33:00.420 --> 02:33:01.570
TALIESIN: Come on.

02:33:01.600 --> 02:33:03.090
Don't be stupid.

02:33:03.120 --> 02:33:04.780
-That's stupid.
-MARISHA: Pretty stupid.

02:33:04.810 --> 02:33:06.450
LAURA: Oh my God,
we're all gonna--

02:33:06.480 --> 02:33:08.000
I'm not gonna say it.

02:33:08.030 --> 02:33:09.060
-We're gonna--
-TRAVIS: Don't you-- shh!

02:33:09.090 --> 02:33:10.150
LAURA: We're gonna get
through this, you guys.

02:33:10.180 --> 02:33:11.150
We're all gonna
get through this.

02:33:11.180 --> 02:33:12.570
TRAVIS: ♪ I gotta get through this ♪

02:33:12.600 --> 02:33:14.240
♪ I gotta get
through this ♪

02:33:14.270 --> 02:33:16.330
♪ I gotta get ♪♪

02:33:16.360 --> 02:33:19.480
TALIESIN: Yeah, so I've got--
that's a-- that's a--

02:33:19.510 --> 02:33:21.330
-That's a gun jam.
-MARISHA: Fuck.

02:33:21.360 --> 02:33:22.720
-MATT: Really?
-TALIESIN: Yeah.

02:33:22.750 --> 02:33:23.750
-LAURA: Fuck.
-TALIESIN: Hold on.

02:33:23.780 --> 02:33:25.420
LAURA: Oh my God.

02:33:25.450 --> 02:33:27.840
TALIESIN: That's a
bad gun jam.

02:33:27.870 --> 02:33:30.180
I'm talking bad,
they're both bad gun jams.

02:33:30.210 --> 02:33:32.090
Alright, I've got
one weapon left

02:33:32.120 --> 02:33:33.510
that can just barely make it,

02:33:33.540 --> 02:33:35.810
so I'm just
screaming to the world.

02:33:35.840 --> 02:33:37.480
Here we go.

02:33:37.510 --> 02:33:38.690
MATT: So you're pulling
out Retort.

02:33:38.720 --> 02:33:40.780
TALIESIN: Yeah, Retort is out
and that's a 23.

02:33:40.810 --> 02:33:42.540
MATT: That hits.

02:33:44.240 --> 02:33:46.050
Two more attacks on that, right?

02:33:47.490 --> 02:33:50.660
TALIESIN: Only one more because I took
an attack with Bad News.

02:33:50.690 --> 02:33:54.450
MATT: That's-- well, Bad News
takes an attack to reload.

02:33:54.480 --> 02:33:57.180
TALIESIN: But-- no, the
first shot went--

02:33:57.210 --> 02:33:59.360
MATT: Right, but usually,
it's action.

02:33:59.390 --> 02:34:03.450
TALIESIN: Right, so I have two more-- I
have two attacks with Retort.

02:34:03.480 --> 02:34:05.880
-So, that's--
-MATT: That hits.

02:34:06.600 --> 02:34:09.300
TALIESIN: That's um, oh,
that's nice.

02:34:09.330 --> 02:34:10.570
Fourteen points of damage.

02:34:10.600 --> 02:34:11.760
MATT: Okay.

02:34:15.060 --> 02:34:16.130
TALIESIN: And...

02:34:18.870 --> 02:34:22.510
Oh, that was so mean, that
was almost a natural 20.

02:34:22.540 --> 02:34:24.920
-Twenty-four.
-MATT: That hits.

02:34:26.840 --> 02:34:29.390
TALIESIN: Ah, 16 points of damage.

02:34:29.420 --> 02:34:30.750
-MATT: Nice.
-TRAVIS: Nice.

02:34:30.780 --> 02:34:33.260
MATT: Let me take some
concentration checks on that.

02:34:33.260 --> 02:34:35.330
Yep and yeah.

02:34:35.360 --> 02:34:37.600
TALIESIN: And I'm going to reload,

02:34:37.630 --> 02:34:38.960
and I'm going to

02:34:40.540 --> 02:34:43.090
start running
across the wall

02:34:43.120 --> 02:34:45.510
away from the fray.

02:34:45.540 --> 02:34:46.750
MATT: Around this way?

02:34:46.780 --> 02:34:48.000
TALIESIN: Yeah.

02:34:48.030 --> 02:34:49.120
MATT: So, you get about there.

02:34:49.150 --> 02:34:50.720
TALIESIN: That far.

02:34:50.750 --> 02:34:52.130
Getting out of the way.

02:34:52.130 --> 02:34:53.540
MATT: Okay.

02:34:53.570 --> 02:34:55.360
That ends your turn.

02:34:55.390 --> 02:34:57.270
It is now back
to a lair action.

02:34:57.300 --> 02:34:59.160
-SAM: Great.
-TRAVIS: Fuck.

02:35:00.060 --> 02:35:02.450
MATT: The ground in the
center here quakes

02:35:02.480 --> 02:35:07.000
and cracks open as a
familiar burst of magma--

02:35:07.030 --> 02:35:09.280
-Everyone in this vicinity.
-LAURA: Goddammit.

02:35:11.060 --> 02:35:15.330
MATT: I need Vex.

02:35:15.360 --> 02:35:17.750
Vax, you're--

02:35:17.780 --> 02:35:21.150
LIAM: Well, I gotta go,
I've got one success.

02:35:21.180 --> 02:35:23.240
MATT: Right, but you're still
unconscious, right?

02:35:23.270 --> 02:35:24.570
LIAM: Yeah.

02:35:24.600 --> 02:35:27.090
MATT: So, you just take-- you just
lose a death saving throw.

02:35:27.120 --> 02:35:30.450
As the magma bursts and sprays
around, so you take one.

02:35:30.480 --> 02:35:32.480
I need you to make
a dexterity save.

02:35:32.510 --> 02:35:35.000
-I need Scanlan--
-SAM: I lose another death save.

02:35:35.030 --> 02:35:37.690
-MATT: You lose another.
-LAURA: You got one left, Scanlan?

02:35:37.720 --> 02:35:39.090
MATT: I need Pike to make

02:35:39.120 --> 02:35:42.840
a dexterity saving throw.

02:35:42.870 --> 02:35:44.060
TRAVIS: Me too, right?

02:35:44.090 --> 02:35:45.180
MATT: And you too, Grog.

02:35:45.210 --> 02:35:46.420
SAM: He's got high dex, right?

02:35:46.450 --> 02:35:47.420
Right?

02:35:47.450 --> 02:35:49.240
LAURA: Well, this, you know what?

02:35:49.240 --> 02:35:51.390
MATT: Gilmore does not make it.

02:35:51.390 --> 02:35:53.240
TRAVIS: That's not bad.

02:35:53.270 --> 02:35:56.210
MATT: I'm rolling shit
for damage, that's good.

02:35:56.240 --> 02:35:57.590
Wow.

02:35:59.000 --> 02:36:00.480
SAM: What'd you roll, Laurs?

02:36:00.510 --> 02:36:02.180
LAURA: I rolled an
eight for Pike.

02:36:02.210 --> 02:36:03.180
MATT: Okay, so--

02:36:03.210 --> 02:36:04.720
LAURA: And a one for me.

02:36:04.750 --> 02:36:07.540
MATT: Okay, ten points of fire
damage to each of you halved,

02:36:07.570 --> 02:36:08.870
so you both take five.

02:36:09.000 --> 02:36:10.480
LAURA: Okay, I'm unconscious.

02:36:10.510 --> 02:36:12.630
MATT: Okay.

02:36:13.480 --> 02:36:16.000
LAURA: This is so fun, you guys,
I love this fight.

02:36:16.000 --> 02:36:17.650
SAM: Let's go-- oh.

02:36:18.510 --> 02:36:20.150
LAURA: Pike's at 29.

02:36:20.180 --> 02:36:22.540
TRAVIS: I rolled a 19.

02:36:22.570 --> 02:36:24.450
MATT: A 19, okay, you succeed,
so you take half damage.

02:36:24.480 --> 02:36:27.390
So you take five, but you're
resistant from the potion,

02:36:27.420 --> 02:36:28.720
so half that, so two.

02:36:28.750 --> 02:36:30.090
Two points
of fire damage.

02:36:30.090 --> 02:36:31.060
TRAVIS: Okay.

02:36:32.150 --> 02:36:33.600
MATT: Alrighty.

02:36:33.630 --> 02:36:35.580
It is now Raishan's turn.

02:36:37.190 --> 02:36:38.410
MARISHA: So not good.

02:36:38.410 --> 02:36:40.660
TRAVIS: I just want to go
flip the table over.

02:36:40.690 --> 02:36:42.150
MATT: Hasted.

02:36:42.180 --> 02:36:44.450
Raishan, by the way, from
the attack from Percy,

02:36:44.480 --> 02:36:47.060
the damage, you can see Raishan
is now visibly bleeding.

02:36:47.090 --> 02:36:48.880
Parts of the
scales are torn.

02:36:48.880 --> 02:36:51.500
You can see now, at a
close up vantage point,

02:36:53.000 --> 02:36:55.630
as much as the previous
dragons you've battled

02:36:55.660 --> 02:36:58.540
have had a lot
of resilience,

02:36:58.570 --> 02:37:00.630
Raishan's taken a
fair amount of damage,

02:37:00.660 --> 02:37:03.330
but seems to not be
quite as physically hearty

02:37:03.360 --> 02:37:05.180
as what you
previously faced

02:37:05.210 --> 02:37:08.630
and is looking
visibly hurt.

02:37:08.660 --> 02:37:11.870
Raishan is going
to begin the round,

02:37:12.000 --> 02:37:14.030
turning to
the rest of you.

02:37:14.060 --> 02:37:18.840
"I have business elsewhere, and
you're being really obnoxious.

02:37:18.870 --> 02:37:21.610
Stay down."

02:37:22.300 --> 02:37:24.630
And glancing over
is going to go ahead

02:37:24.660 --> 02:37:28.720
and with both of her hands,
again, release another...

02:37:28.750 --> 02:37:31.090
She is almost
out of spells.

02:37:31.120 --> 02:37:34.840
Cone of Cold.

02:37:34.870 --> 02:37:36.670
LAURA: Oh no, this is
gonna be Scanlan.

02:37:37.910 --> 02:37:39.000
MARISHA: Fuck.

02:37:39.000 --> 02:37:42.000
MATT: That is-- I need--

02:37:42.030 --> 02:37:44.670
-So, Scanlan--
-TRAVIS: No!

02:37:45.330 --> 02:37:47.450
-MATT: Scanlan is...
-TALIESIN: God fucking damn it.

02:37:47.480 --> 02:37:51.660
MATT: Frozen, covered
in ice, locked in place.

02:37:51.690 --> 02:37:54.960
A solid gnome
bereft of life.

02:37:54.960 --> 02:37:56.240
Motionless
on the ground.

02:37:56.270 --> 02:37:58.600
SAM: I died as I lived: hard.

02:37:58.630 --> 02:38:01.030
(laughter)

02:38:04.330 --> 02:38:05.580
MATT: Gilmore takes--

02:38:05.580 --> 02:38:07.790
TRAVIS: I heard him say
that before he died.

02:38:07.790 --> 02:38:10.120
MATT: Gilmore loses a
death saving throw.

02:38:10.150 --> 02:38:12.120
Vax, you take another damage

02:38:12.120 --> 02:38:14.210
to your two
failed death saving throws.

02:38:14.210 --> 02:38:16.560
Pike needs to make a
constitution saving throw.

02:38:16.560 --> 02:38:18.280
Grog, constitution
saving throw.

02:38:19.940 --> 02:38:21.000
LAURA: Was I in there?

02:38:21.000 --> 02:38:23.070
MATT: You were, so you also--

02:38:25.600 --> 02:38:26.630
TRAVIS: Twenty-four.

02:38:26.660 --> 02:38:28.210
MATT: Twenty-four,
you succeed.

02:38:28.240 --> 02:38:29.450
TRAVIS: Plus 10 for
constitution.

02:38:29.480 --> 02:38:31.890
-LAURA: That's good.
-TRAVIS: Fourteen.

02:38:33.090 --> 02:38:34.060
MARISHA: Jesus.

02:38:34.090 --> 02:38:36.480
LAURA: Eleven for Pike.

02:38:36.510 --> 02:38:39.390
MATT: Okay, that's 30 points
of cold damage to Pike.

02:38:39.420 --> 02:38:41.110
-LAURA: Seriously?
-MATT: Yeah.

02:38:41.110 --> 02:38:42.390
LAURA: She's unconscious.

02:38:42.420 --> 02:38:43.570
TALIESIN: Yep.

02:38:43.600 --> 02:38:45.840
MATT: Pike is unconscious.

02:38:45.870 --> 02:38:47.030
TALIESIN: That's where we're at.

02:38:47.060 --> 02:38:49.020
LAURA: We're-- we're--
I don't know how

02:38:49.020 --> 02:38:51.270
we're gonna
get Scanlan back.

02:38:51.300 --> 02:38:54.120
TALIESIN: I--I have no--
there's no--

02:38:55.690 --> 02:38:57.510
MARISHA: That'll be a
later question?

02:38:57.540 --> 02:38:58.540
TALIESIN: That may happen.

02:38:58.570 --> 02:38:59.600
MATT: So Pike is down.

02:38:59.630 --> 02:39:02.330
-TALIESIN: You have a plan?
-SAM: I have a plan.

02:39:02.360 --> 02:39:05.970
It involves me humping
a lot of angels in heaven.

02:39:09.840 --> 02:39:11.110
TALIESIN: Okay.

02:39:13.600 --> 02:39:15.870
MATT: Watching this carnage,

02:39:16.000 --> 02:39:20.510
you watch as the spell finalizes
the blast of cold arcane energy

02:39:20.540 --> 02:39:23.270
just careening forth
and then fading.

02:39:23.300 --> 02:39:26.600
The ground itself, which is
now, normally glowing orange,

02:39:26.630 --> 02:39:30.150
is now covered with a
very thin sheet of ice

02:39:30.180 --> 02:39:32.840
and you watch steam rise
up from the contrasting heat

02:39:32.870 --> 02:39:34.030
and cold
from the spell

02:39:34.060 --> 02:39:35.840
effecting the
surrounding atmosphere.

02:39:35.870 --> 02:39:37.600
As the mist dissipates,

02:39:37.630 --> 02:39:40.640
you see a big toothy grin
curl across Raishan's face.

02:39:40.640 --> 02:39:43.000
Little bit of dragon blood
curling past her teeth

02:39:43.030 --> 02:39:44.810
from the wounds
that she's suffered.

02:39:44.840 --> 02:39:47.510
Glaring nervously
over at J'Mon Sa Ord,

02:39:47.540 --> 02:39:49.660
who has taken nearly
no damage at this point

02:39:49.690 --> 02:39:52.810
and is currently up
in Raishan's face.

02:39:52.840 --> 02:39:57.690
Raishan says, "Well,
I'm afraid I have to get

02:39:57.720 --> 02:40:01.600
to the rest of my day.

02:40:01.630 --> 02:40:04.270
Die amongst your
friends as you should."

02:40:04.300 --> 02:40:06.540
And just tears off of J'Mon

02:40:06.570 --> 02:40:09.120
and goes into a
full hasted fly away.

02:40:09.150 --> 02:40:11.240
-SAM: Does J'Mon get--
-LIAM: Attack of opportunity, J'Mon.

02:40:11.270 --> 02:40:12.690
MATT: J'Mon does,
J'Mon is gonna make

02:40:12.720 --> 02:40:17.480
a bite attack
against Raishan.

02:40:17.510 --> 02:40:19.280
With a natural 20!

02:40:19.280 --> 02:40:21.020
-SAM: Does that grapple?
-TRAVIS: Are you serious?

02:40:21.020 --> 02:40:23.750
-MARISHA: Does that grapple?
-MATT: It does not grapple.

02:40:23.750 --> 02:40:25.140
But that is...

02:40:27.470 --> 02:40:30.000
MARISHA: She'd have to do a
concentration check, right?

02:40:30.030 --> 02:40:31.510
MATT: She will, yeah.

02:40:31.540 --> 02:40:35.330
That is 18 plus eight.

02:40:35.360 --> 02:40:38.390
That's 26 piercing damage plus
she's immune to poison.

02:40:38.420 --> 02:40:40.300
She takes no
poison damage.

02:40:40.330 --> 02:40:43.060
That's 28 points of
piercing damage to her.

02:40:43.090 --> 02:40:45.450
TALIESIN: (whimpering)

02:40:45.480 --> 02:40:48.570
MATT: Concentration check,
oh, she's fine.

02:40:48.600 --> 02:40:51.230
It's ten plus 14,
so, yeah, she's fine.

02:40:52.450 --> 02:40:55.670
So, the haste does not dispel,
however, J'Mon bites out

02:40:55.670 --> 02:40:57.870
and takes a huge
chunk of flesh

02:40:57.870 --> 02:40:59.810
as the teeth
just scrape across

02:40:59.840 --> 02:41:02.090
the back of Raishan's wing
and shoulder like...

02:41:02.120 --> 02:41:03.210
(snarls)

02:41:03.240 --> 02:41:06.300
But manages to pull
away and at a full

02:41:06.330 --> 02:41:10.060
160 foot flying
speed hasted

02:41:10.090 --> 02:41:12.540
and just disappears
down the hallway.

02:41:12.570 --> 02:41:14.120
MARISHA: Should've done that,
should've done it.

02:41:14.150 --> 02:41:18.030
MATT: Into the ashes
and shadow behind.

02:41:18.060 --> 02:41:19.630
Keyleth, it's your turn.

02:41:19.660 --> 02:41:23.450
MARISHA: Okay, she has 120 foot--
or she just went 160 feet?

02:41:23.480 --> 02:41:24.690
MATT: A 160 feet, yeah.

02:41:24.720 --> 02:41:29.660
♪

02:41:29.690 --> 02:41:31.510
MARISHA: Is she--

02:41:31.540 --> 02:41:39.150
♪

02:41:39.180 --> 02:41:41.120
But she wasn't--

02:41:41.150 --> 02:41:43.860
Fuck me,
oh my God, okay.

02:41:45.660 --> 02:41:48.420
Can I still see her
through the tunnel?

02:41:48.450 --> 02:41:51.880
MATT: No, she is outside of
your dark vision view radius

02:41:51.880 --> 02:41:54.030
and there is no light
in the tunnel ahead

02:41:54.030 --> 02:41:55.540
and it is a
slight incline.

02:41:55.570 --> 02:41:57.270
You just watch her just...

02:41:57.300 --> 02:41:58.870
Disappear into
the dark tunnel.

02:41:59.000 --> 02:42:01.300
Currently have no
bead of sight on her.

02:42:01.330 --> 02:42:03.620
TRAVIS: Smoke the tunnel, dude.

02:42:04.450 --> 02:42:06.570
Maybe you get her, 
maybe you don't.

02:42:06.600 --> 02:42:08.510
I'm gonna shut up.

02:42:08.540 --> 02:42:10.520
MARISHA: It's a range thing.

02:42:12.690 --> 02:42:15.210
I mean, could I
try and-- fuck.

02:42:15.240 --> 02:42:17.180
-This is really bad.
-TALIESIN: Yes, it's really bad.

02:42:17.210 --> 02:42:22.090
♪

02:42:22.120 --> 02:42:23.690
MARISHA: She's so far away, dude.

02:42:23.720 --> 02:42:25.870
SAM: J'Mon can chase her.

02:42:25.870 --> 02:42:27.280
LAURA: But he's there and--

02:42:27.280 --> 02:42:29.700
TALIESIN: And she's so much
faster than him.

02:42:31.270 --> 02:42:32.690
She's hasted.

02:42:32.720 --> 02:42:35.390
TRAVIS: Don't worry, I'm gonna
take off at a run and--

02:42:35.420 --> 02:42:37.000
TALIESIN: Yeah.

02:42:37.030 --> 02:42:40.810
He can only go
probably half her speed.

02:42:40.840 --> 02:42:43.840
TRAVIS: Picture Butterbean
running down an empty street.

02:42:43.870 --> 02:42:46.510
MARISHA: 'Cause my--
my question is--

02:42:46.540 --> 02:42:48.420
SAM: Jarret's still up there.

02:42:48.450 --> 02:42:50.060
MARISHA: She didn't necessarily--

02:42:50.060 --> 02:42:51.830
LAURA: Just waiting,
crossbow loaded.

02:42:51.830 --> 02:42:53.300
TRAVIS: He's just like...

02:42:53.330 --> 02:42:55.150
(whimpers)

02:42:55.840 --> 02:42:57.840
MARISHA: 'Cause could I try
and move up

02:42:57.870 --> 02:43:02.090
and then do a long range
Wall of Stone spell?

02:43:02.120 --> 02:43:06.600
To try and collapse the
tunnel before she gets out?

02:43:06.630 --> 02:43:08.570
It's 120 foot.

02:43:08.600 --> 02:43:10.420
MATT: A 120 foot range?

02:43:10.450 --> 02:43:13.000
The spell from where
you are currently,

02:43:13.030 --> 02:43:17.510
which is over here,
she went 160 feet

02:43:17.540 --> 02:43:19.360
even further away
from you than she was,

02:43:19.390 --> 02:43:21.240
so she'd be beyond
the distance

02:43:21.270 --> 02:43:24.840
of the spell
unfortunately.

02:43:24.870 --> 02:43:26.270
TRAVIS: Cause if you miss,
you trap us.

02:43:26.300 --> 02:43:28.090
LAURA: Yeah, and then
we can't get out.

02:43:28.120 --> 02:43:29.420
MARISHA: No, I mean, I can't--

02:43:29.450 --> 02:43:31.750
I mean, I could get
us out again, but--

02:43:31.780 --> 02:43:33.290
LAURA: A bunch of dead people,

02:43:33.290 --> 02:43:35.630
you could get a bunch
of dead people out?

02:43:35.660 --> 02:43:37.450
MARISHA: I know.

02:43:37.480 --> 02:43:39.740
Okay, wow.

02:43:39.740 --> 02:43:42.100
TRAVIS: Indiana Jones and
the Last crusade.

02:43:42.100 --> 02:43:43.550
MARISHA: This is really bad.

02:43:43.550 --> 02:43:47.660
Okay, I will use...

02:43:48.070 --> 02:43:50.350
LAURA: That wasn't her
last spell, by the way.

02:43:50.350 --> 02:43:52.060
She's got three spell slots left.

02:43:52.060 --> 02:43:54.270
MARISHA: Who's-- yeah,
who's really close?

02:43:54.300 --> 02:43:55.570
Who's like one away?

02:43:55.600 --> 02:43:56.810
Who's like really bad?

02:43:56.840 --> 02:43:58.750
-LAURA: Close to death?
-MARISHA: Yeah.

02:43:58.780 --> 02:44:00.570
LAURA: He's closer to
death than me.

02:44:00.600 --> 02:44:02.180
LIAM: I'm two failures.

02:44:02.210 --> 02:44:05.120
-SAM: Is Pike down?
-LAURA: Pike's unconscious.

02:44:05.150 --> 02:44:06.810
-TRAVIS: Oh, she is?
-SAM: Get Pike up.

02:44:06.840 --> 02:44:09.150
LAURA: I'm one fail,
he's two fails.

02:44:09.180 --> 02:44:10.450
Scanlan's dead.

02:44:10.480 --> 02:44:12.540
TALIESIN: Who's got healing spells?

02:44:12.570 --> 02:44:14.450
Wake up whoever can heal.

02:44:14.480 --> 02:44:16.390
LAURA: I've got Cure Wounds
if I'm awake.

02:44:16.420 --> 02:44:17.630
TALIESIN: So, get her up.

02:44:17.660 --> 02:44:20.290
LIAM: I can heal people
if I get up.

02:44:21.110 --> 02:44:22.810
MARISHA: Okay, it doesn't matter.

02:44:22.840 --> 02:44:24.570
Can I kinda jump and make

02:44:24.600 --> 02:44:28.360
my way over like,
this kind of...

02:44:28.390 --> 02:44:29.750
TALIESIN: Fuck.

02:44:29.780 --> 02:44:34.120
MARISHA: This-- can I cross this
tinier lava right there?

02:44:34.150 --> 02:44:37.060
Kind of like, or is that
a pretty far jump?

02:44:37.090 --> 02:44:38.660
MATT: I mean, you have
to still jump.

02:44:38.690 --> 02:44:40.600
So you have to make
an athletics check.

02:44:40.600 --> 02:44:42.380
MARISHA: How far of a
jump is that?

02:44:42.380 --> 02:44:44.480
MATT: It's about six,
seven feet.

02:44:44.510 --> 02:44:46.720
So make an athletics check.

02:44:46.750 --> 02:44:48.450
MARISHA: Sure, why not?

02:44:48.480 --> 02:44:51.120
Why not at this point?

02:44:51.150 --> 02:44:53.450
LAURA: No, Keyleth, no.

02:44:53.480 --> 02:44:56.560
MARISHA: Well, that was
a natural one.

02:44:56.560 --> 02:44:58.010
TRAVIS: On what, on what?

02:44:58.010 --> 02:44:59.150
SAM: Just moving.

02:44:59.180 --> 02:45:01.030
MARISHA: Just trying
to jump across

02:45:01.060 --> 02:45:03.180
what should have been
literally anything else.

02:45:03.210 --> 02:45:05.190
TRAVIS: How many hit
points do you have?

02:45:05.190 --> 02:45:06.700
How many hit
points do you have?

02:45:06.700 --> 02:45:08.220
SAM: It doesn't matter,
she's not even

02:45:08.220 --> 02:45:10.090
gonna get over to
anyone to heal them.

02:45:10.120 --> 02:45:11.840
-MARISHA: 60.
-LAURA: I don't know, man, lava.

02:45:11.870 --> 02:45:13.300
TRAVIS: One six or six zero.

02:45:13.330 --> 02:45:14.630
-TALIESIN: Six zero.
-SAM: She's fine.

02:45:14.660 --> 02:45:16.090
But no, she's not
necessarily fine.

02:45:16.120 --> 02:45:17.660
LAURA: Lava has a
new rule now.

02:45:17.690 --> 02:45:19.870
MATT: Well, not a new rule,
the actual rule.

02:45:20.000 --> 02:45:23.220
TRAVIS: The actual rule that we didn't
use the very very first time.

02:45:23.220 --> 02:45:24.720
But we felt it last time.

02:45:24.750 --> 02:45:27.330
MATT: So, as you rush
over trying to help,

02:45:27.360 --> 02:45:30.060
you go to leap,
but your foot catches

02:45:30.090 --> 02:45:32.330
what you thought was
solid volcanic rock.

02:45:32.360 --> 02:45:34.720
Unfortunately,
it's brittle and broken

02:45:34.750 --> 02:45:36.480
and it slips
beneath your foot.

02:45:36.510 --> 02:45:38.600
In doing so, you only
get about three feet

02:45:38.630 --> 02:45:41.600
before you plant the
lower half of your body

02:45:41.630 --> 02:45:43.630
straight
into the lava.

02:45:46.720 --> 02:45:47.720
LAURA: Oh my God.

02:45:47.720 --> 02:45:49.330
TRAVIS: (laughing)

02:45:49.330 --> 02:45:51.090
MATT: That's 53 points
of fire damage.

02:45:51.120 --> 02:45:52.210
-LAURA: 53!
-SAM: You're alive!

02:45:52.240 --> 02:45:54.070
LAURA: Get up, get out,
you can get out of it.

02:45:54.070 --> 02:45:55.300
You've got
seven points left.

02:45:55.330 --> 02:45:57.560
TALIESIN: You died as you lived.

02:45:57.560 --> 02:45:59.540
MARISHA: A fucking dumbass, yeah!

02:45:59.570 --> 02:46:00.840
TRAVIS: I can't see!

02:46:00.870 --> 02:46:03.090
It's just a wall of tears.

02:46:06.270 --> 02:46:09.110
LAURA: Can she get out
of the lava or is she just in?

02:46:09.110 --> 02:46:11.610
MARISHA: Can I get out now?
I'm trying to use my movement

02:46:11.610 --> 02:46:12.980
or am I gonna
die if I get out?

02:46:12.980 --> 02:46:16.390
MATT: You're essentially prone in the lava.

02:46:16.420 --> 02:46:19.470
You rolled a one to jump
and you basically went...

02:46:19.470 --> 02:46:21.010
-LAURA: Belly flopped into lava.

02:46:21.010 --> 02:46:23.780
LAURA: You mean, she's gonna take
damage trying to get out of it?

02:46:23.780 --> 02:46:25.240
MARISHA: Can I get out?

02:46:25.240 --> 02:46:26.840
MATT: You're technically prone.

02:46:26.870 --> 02:46:28.660
The rest of your movement
will get you up and out,

02:46:28.690 --> 02:46:30.060
but it'll just
get you out of the lava.

02:46:30.090 --> 02:46:32.330
-LAURA: At least you're out.
-LIAM: Get out, get out.

02:46:32.360 --> 02:46:34.180
MATT: So, you'll get out and you'll
be just on the edge there.

02:46:34.210 --> 02:46:35.510
LAURA: Oh my God.

02:46:38.300 --> 02:46:40.060
TRAVIS: This is the best.

02:46:40.090 --> 02:46:42.130
LAURA: This is the worst!

02:46:43.180 --> 02:46:44.960
MATT: Wow!

02:46:44.960 --> 02:46:47.420
MARISHA: I was like, as long
as I don't roll a one,

02:46:47.450 --> 02:46:49.180
that shouldn't
be that hard-- okay.

02:46:49.180 --> 02:46:51.550
TALIESIN: Oh, look, someone left a
metaphor on the ground.

02:46:51.550 --> 02:46:52.720
(laughter)

02:46:52.750 --> 02:46:54.300
Don't step in it
or anything.

02:46:54.300 --> 02:46:56.510
Oh God,
it's everywhere.

02:46:57.630 --> 02:46:59.390
-TRAVIS: Oh, shit.
-MATT: Wow.

02:46:59.420 --> 02:47:01.210
TALIESIN: Well, this
could've gone worse.

02:47:01.240 --> 02:47:02.330
MATT: Wow!

02:47:02.360 --> 02:47:03.600
TALIESIN: Yeah!

02:47:03.630 --> 02:47:05.270
MARISHA: Okay, I'm out
of the flame.

02:47:05.300 --> 02:47:07.430
MATT: This whole thing's
a metaphor for 2017.

02:47:07.430 --> 02:47:09.780
LAURA: Does J'Mon Sa Ord
have any healing spells?

02:47:09.780 --> 02:47:12.540
MARISHA: And I reach over
as a bonus action

02:47:12.570 --> 02:47:16.090
and do a Healing Word
to-- to Vax.

02:47:16.120 --> 02:47:18.060
MATT: Okay.

02:47:18.090 --> 02:47:19.390
TRAVIS: Just--

02:47:19.420 --> 02:47:20.680
MATT: What level?

02:47:23.360 --> 02:47:24.840
MARISHA: I don't know.

02:47:24.840 --> 02:47:25.970
TRAVIS: Come on, stay with it.

02:47:25.970 --> 02:47:28.030
-Stay in the fight.
-MARISHA: Level one.

02:47:28.060 --> 02:47:30.600
Oh, that's good, that's
four so, nine points.

02:47:30.630 --> 02:47:31.600
SAM: Nine points.

02:47:31.630 --> 02:47:33.120
TRAVIS: He wakes up!

02:47:33.150 --> 02:47:34.450
MATT: Vax is now conscious.

02:47:34.480 --> 02:47:35.510
MARISHA: No, I'm sorry ten points,
that's ten points.

02:47:35.540 --> 02:47:37.540
-MATT: There you go.
-LAURA: Sweet, even better.

02:47:37.570 --> 02:47:40.030
You're double digits.

02:47:40.060 --> 02:47:43.570
Scanlan, we've got to just--
we've got to get Scanlan back.

02:47:45.440 --> 02:47:49.390
TALIESIN: There's a lot of work
that needs to happen.

02:47:49.390 --> 02:47:51.150
TRAVIS: I got her,
I got-- I got Pike.

02:47:51.180 --> 02:47:53.840
TALIESIN: Who's up?

02:47:53.870 --> 02:47:55.000
SAM: Grog is up.

02:47:55.030 --> 02:47:56.330
TALIESIN: I mean, who's next?

02:47:56.360 --> 02:47:57.600
TRAVIS: I think it's me.

02:47:57.630 --> 02:48:01.660
-LAURA: It's Gilmore.
-TRAVIS: No, it's Gilmore.

02:48:01.690 --> 02:48:04.150
MATT: So, Gilmore gets up.

02:48:04.180 --> 02:48:07.240
Kind of looks around.

02:48:07.270 --> 02:48:08.870
"Where did she go?"

02:48:09.000 --> 02:48:11.000
TRAVIS: "Through the tunnel."

02:48:11.030 --> 02:48:12.450
MATT: Okay.

02:48:12.480 --> 02:48:14.690
He rushes this way

02:48:14.720 --> 02:48:17.660
and as he gets
about there, he...

02:48:17.690 --> 02:48:22.210
slams into something that
is currently invisible.

02:48:22.240 --> 02:48:24.240
You see a slight
ripple of arcane energy

02:48:24.240 --> 02:48:27.170
and you see a series
of small glyphs spiral outward

02:48:27.170 --> 02:48:29.420
and then it goes
see-through again.

02:48:29.450 --> 02:48:31.700
He starts slamming
his fists on it.

02:48:32.510 --> 02:48:35.720
"Of course, of course.

02:48:35.750 --> 02:48:37.060
Of course."

02:48:38.600 --> 02:48:39.730
TRAVIS: No.

02:48:41.270 --> 02:48:42.420
MATT: He goes and...

02:48:42.450 --> 02:48:45.690
Let's see what
he has left.

02:48:45.720 --> 02:48:48.600
TRAVIS: She made a
Lite Brite wall.

02:48:48.630 --> 02:48:49.870
MATT: Yeah.

02:48:50.000 --> 02:48:52.030
TRAVIS: He's a mime.

02:48:52.060 --> 02:48:54.720
MATT: Technically, he looks like a
mime from your standpoint.

02:48:54.750 --> 02:48:57.720
MARISHA: Can I turn to J'Mon?

02:48:57.750 --> 02:49:01.010
Say, "J'Mon, can you
sense her presence?

02:49:01.010 --> 02:49:02.250
She's a fellow dragon.

02:49:02.250 --> 02:49:04.270
Do you know where
she might be going

02:49:04.300 --> 02:49:06.240
or what she
might be doing?"

02:49:06.270 --> 02:49:07.940
MATT: "I haven't the faintest.

02:49:07.940 --> 02:49:09.613
I only just arrived."

02:49:11.780 --> 02:49:14.690
TRAVIS: Oh, fuck, Thordak is
outside of the cave!

02:49:14.720 --> 02:49:17.090
LIAM: Are we out of combat now?

02:49:17.120 --> 02:49:19.190
TRAVIS: Thordak is still
in the hallway.

02:49:19.190 --> 02:49:20.780
LAURA: The round's still going.

02:49:20.780 --> 02:49:23.060
MATT: So we're gonna continue going
through the order here.

02:49:23.090 --> 02:49:24.720
LAURA: So, it's Grog,
it's your turn, Grog.

02:49:24.750 --> 02:49:25.870
MATT: So, Grog, it's your turn.

02:49:26.000 --> 02:49:29.540
TRAVIS: I run to my buddy,
Pike, and I beer bong

02:49:29.570 --> 02:49:32.690
this Greater healing
potion into her gullet.

02:49:32.720 --> 02:49:34.660
MATT: Okay.

02:49:34.690 --> 02:49:37.150
-TRAVIS: What is that?
-LAURA: 4d8 plus four.

02:49:37.180 --> 02:49:39.180
I mean, 4d4 plus four.

02:49:39.210 --> 02:49:43.690
MATT: 4d4 plus four.

02:49:43.720 --> 02:49:45.210
TRAVIS: Eight.

02:49:45.240 --> 02:49:47.030
Twelve.

02:49:47.060 --> 02:49:48.720
-Twelve points.
-LAURA: So, Pike is awake.

02:49:48.750 --> 02:49:51.210
TRAVIS: "Hi, hi!"

02:49:51.240 --> 02:49:53.060
-"Go, heal!"
-LAURA: "What's going--"

02:49:53.060 --> 02:49:55.210
TRAVIS: "Lot of problems."

02:49:55.240 --> 02:49:58.030
SAM: Got any more of
those Revivify's?

02:49:58.060 --> 02:50:00.090
MATT: Alright, that
ends your turn, Grog?

02:50:00.120 --> 02:50:02.270
LAURA: Actually, she does have
a third level spell left.

02:50:02.280 --> 02:50:03.290
-MATT: You do.
-MARISHA: Really?

02:50:03.300 --> 02:50:04.060
-LAURA: Yes!

02:50:04.060 --> 02:50:05.790
LAURA: She does have a
third level spell!

02:50:05.790 --> 02:50:07.660
MARISHA: Well, yes, do that,
do that really quick!

02:50:07.660 --> 02:50:09.840
LAURA: She cast Revivify at fourth
level the last time.

02:50:09.840 --> 02:50:11.270
MARISHA: Do it, do it, do it.

02:50:11.300 --> 02:50:13.630
TRAVIS: The eggs that
remain are toast?

02:50:13.660 --> 02:50:14.720
LAURA: Holy shit.

02:50:14.750 --> 02:50:16.960
MATT: Two of them are
completely destroyed

02:50:16.960 --> 02:50:19.350
and there is one that has
been shot and is leaking.

02:50:19.350 --> 02:50:20.840
LAURA: I have it circled.

02:50:20.870 --> 02:50:22.420
TALIESIN: Don't worry about it.

02:50:22.450 --> 02:50:23.450
Let's get out there.

02:50:23.480 --> 02:50:25.120
TRAVIS: Alright, that
ends my turn.

02:50:25.150 --> 02:50:26.420
MATT: Okay.

02:50:26.450 --> 02:50:29.600
That brings us to Vex.

02:50:29.630 --> 02:50:31.420
I need you to make
a death saving throw.

02:50:31.450 --> 02:50:33.090
LAURA: Right.

02:50:33.120 --> 02:50:35.100
I'm scared of all these dice.

02:50:35.100 --> 02:50:38.020
TRAVIS: I'm using what's left of my
movement to go towards that egg.

02:50:38.020 --> 02:50:39.560
MATT: Towards this egg?

02:50:39.560 --> 02:50:41.680
-TRAVIS: Yeah, the one shot egg.
-MATT: Okay.

02:50:41.680 --> 02:50:44.210
♪

02:50:44.240 --> 02:50:46.290
TALIESIN: I'm gonna try
something weird.

02:50:46.290 --> 02:50:49.110
MATT: That's two death
saving throws on Vex.

02:50:49.110 --> 02:50:51.360
-TRAVIS: You failed it?
-LAURA: I failed it.

02:50:51.390 --> 02:50:52.420
MATT: Vax.

02:50:52.450 --> 02:50:54.120
LIAM: I stumble over to my sister

02:50:54.150 --> 02:50:57.840
and cast Lay on Hands and give
her five to bring her back.

02:50:57.870 --> 02:51:00.480
MATT: So, yeah, cause you've
been giving it out--

02:51:00.510 --> 02:51:03.330
LIAM: I haven't done anything
with Lay on Hands.

02:51:03.330 --> 02:51:06.290
Or I might have done it once but
I always do very small amounts.

02:51:06.290 --> 02:51:08.650
I have a total of 15 hit points
cause I'm a third level--

02:51:08.650 --> 02:51:10.590
MATT: I'm pretty sure
you used it once before.

02:51:10.590 --> 02:51:13.180
LIAM: But I've never used more
than five with that spell

02:51:13.210 --> 02:51:14.240
cause it's
worthless to heal.

02:51:14.270 --> 02:51:15.920
It's just good
for bringing up.

02:51:15.920 --> 02:51:17.800
So I have at least
10 hit points left.

02:51:17.800 --> 02:51:20.680
-MATT: Go for it.
-LIAM: Five hit points.

02:51:20.680 --> 02:51:23.210
LAURA: Yeah, cause the only
time you used it before

02:51:23.240 --> 02:51:25.090
was when you BAMFed
up to my broom

02:51:25.120 --> 02:51:26.480
after I grabbed
the dagger.

02:51:26.510 --> 02:51:28.020
MATT: You're still
prone by the way.

02:51:28.020 --> 02:51:29.820
You just basically
crawled over and touched her.

02:51:29.820 --> 02:51:31.030
-LIAM: That's fine.

02:51:31.060 --> 02:51:33.370
I'm gonna use the rest
of my movement to stand.

02:51:33.370 --> 02:51:36.300
MATT: Okay, so you stand up and you
still have half your movement

02:51:36.300 --> 02:51:37.270
if you wanted to.

02:51:37.810 --> 02:51:40.360
LIAM: Everyone who's
down, who's down?

02:51:40.390 --> 02:51:42.170
And I don't mean dead.

02:51:43.300 --> 02:51:45.660
-Pike just got--
-TALIESIN: Pike's up.

02:51:45.690 --> 02:51:47.720
MATT: Pike is conscious,
your sister's conscious.

02:51:47.750 --> 02:51:49.540
-LIAM: Is Kima conscious?
-LAURA: Yes.

02:51:49.570 --> 02:51:50.540
Kima's conscious.

02:51:50.570 --> 02:51:52.330
LIAM: So, we've got
dead Scanlan.

02:51:52.360 --> 02:51:56.240
TALIESIN: And that's--
that's Pike's problem.

02:51:56.270 --> 02:51:58.480
LIAM: And that's it, I'm done.

02:51:58.510 --> 02:51:59.910
Wait, where's that egg?

02:51:59.910 --> 02:52:01.870
-MATT: Which one?
-LIAM: It doesn't matter.

02:52:01.870 --> 02:52:03.280
LAURA: It's the last egg.

02:52:03.280 --> 02:52:04.870
LIAM: I'm done, I'm done.

02:52:07.840 --> 02:52:10.130
MATT: Alrighty, that
ends Vax's turn.

02:52:10.130 --> 02:52:12.870
LAURA: Just worried there's gonna
be another lair action

02:52:12.870 --> 02:52:14.300
in the same spot.

02:52:14.330 --> 02:52:17.870
MATT: Kima rushes up and swinging
her holy sword in the air,

02:52:18.000 --> 02:52:21.750
goes for a full swing, noticing
that everybody's now conscious,

02:52:21.780 --> 02:52:24.550
goes and takes a full swing
towards this invisible barrier.

02:52:25.660 --> 02:52:28.870
As it streaks across, you see
divine energy go flying off

02:52:29.000 --> 02:52:31.780
in a shower of sparks and
a giant shimmering,

02:52:31.810 --> 02:52:34.390
shaking visual on this--

02:52:34.420 --> 02:52:38.330
this force wall that stands here
in the center of the hallway.

02:52:38.360 --> 02:52:41.510
As she finishes her attack,
it shimmers unscathed.

02:52:41.540 --> 02:52:43.720
She goes for a
secondary attack.

02:52:43.750 --> 02:52:44.780
Strikes again.

02:52:44.810 --> 02:52:46.240
This time as it
strikes across

02:52:46.270 --> 02:52:47.720
the sparks are even brighter

02:52:47.750 --> 02:52:50.480
and you can see the impact
almost pushing her back

02:52:50.510 --> 02:52:53.000
off of her feet and
as the blade comes

02:52:53.030 --> 02:52:56.180
to the end of
its second arc.

02:52:56.210 --> 02:52:58.300
She looks up. 
The wall still stands.

02:52:58.330 --> 02:52:59.770
TRAVIS: You are shitting me.

02:52:59.770 --> 02:53:01.120
It doesn't flicker,
doesn't--

02:53:01.150 --> 02:53:03.400
LAURA: It needs like a
dispel or something.

02:53:04.850 --> 02:53:06.390
MARISHA: Oh my God, I could--

02:53:06.420 --> 02:53:07.450
Oh my God, I could!

02:53:07.480 --> 02:53:09.360
TALIESIN: Alright, that's an option.

02:53:09.390 --> 02:53:12.210
MATT: Alrighty that
brings us to...

02:53:13.570 --> 02:53:14.870
-MATT: J'Mon.

02:53:17.210 --> 02:53:19.720
J'Mon rushes.

02:53:19.750 --> 02:53:22.690
Flies up to the edge and
kind of takes a moment

02:53:22.720 --> 02:53:25.390
streak a few claws across it.

02:53:25.420 --> 02:53:26.840
And where the claws streak,

02:53:26.870 --> 02:53:29.600
you can see the shimmering
of this force wall.

02:53:33.540 --> 02:53:35.810
TRAVIS: Well, phone's out, oh God.

02:53:35.840 --> 02:53:38.000
MATT: "The phone's out, oh God"?

02:53:38.030 --> 02:53:40.320
SAM: He's calling an Uber
because he knows

02:53:40.320 --> 02:53:43.020
we're gonna kill him
after this is done.

02:53:43.020 --> 02:53:45.230
MATT: Come on, four percent,
I got four percent left.

02:53:45.230 --> 02:53:47.110
SAM: Four percent, get
this man a charger!

02:53:47.110 --> 02:53:48.810
-MATT: I know.
-SAM: Taliesin!

02:53:48.840 --> 02:53:50.630
LIAM: No, no, no.

02:53:50.660 --> 02:53:53.390
Let's start a
YouTube video on it.

02:53:53.420 --> 02:53:55.750
SAM: Can you run
this over to Matt?

02:53:55.780 --> 02:53:57.810
MATT: Yeah.

02:53:57.840 --> 02:54:01.720
J'Mon, with each strike, is like
testing the boundaries of it

02:54:01.750 --> 02:54:04.200
across the sides of the
tunnel and just goes...

02:54:06.140 --> 02:54:07.750
"This magic holds."

02:54:07.780 --> 02:54:09.330
TRAVIS: What?

02:54:11.450 --> 02:54:12.480
It holds?

02:54:12.510 --> 02:54:14.410
"It--it holds?"

02:54:17.360 --> 02:54:18.690
MATT: Fun charger.

02:54:20.630 --> 02:54:24.000
TALIESIN: Let me know, I've
got maybe a plan.

02:54:24.030 --> 02:54:25.360
Yeah, you've got that.

02:54:25.390 --> 02:54:27.330
That's an option,
I've got another plan.

02:54:27.360 --> 02:54:28.970
You know my plan, my
plan kind of sucks, but.

02:54:28.970 --> 02:54:30.610
MATT: I'm not getting a charge.

02:54:30.610 --> 02:54:32.180
SAM: Give it somebody else.

02:54:32.210 --> 02:54:33.210
There's a button.

02:54:33.240 --> 02:54:34.530
MATT: That's alright.

02:54:34.530 --> 02:54:36.270
It happens.

02:54:36.300 --> 02:54:37.510
Anyway.

02:54:37.540 --> 02:54:39.000
TALIESIN: No, no, it
should just start.

02:54:39.030 --> 02:54:40.510
-SAM: No, there's a button.
-TALIESIN: Oh, there is a button.

02:54:40.540 --> 02:54:42.400
SAM: There's a button,
he'll find it.

02:54:42.400 --> 02:54:45.390
MATT: J'Mon, oh, J'Mon gets
the breath weapon back.

02:54:45.420 --> 02:54:49.120
And kind of pushes...

02:54:49.150 --> 02:54:52.210
both Kima
and Gilmore aside.

02:54:53.390 --> 02:54:55.000
"Excuse me."

02:54:58.750 --> 02:55:03.330
And unleashes a blast of burning
hot breath across this wall.

02:55:03.360 --> 02:55:05.510
As it hits, it
just curls across

02:55:05.540 --> 02:55:07.540
and spreads across
the side of the walls

02:55:07.570 --> 02:55:10.490
as the dragon shields

02:55:10.490 --> 02:55:13.810
both Kima and Gilmore
from the blast.

02:55:13.840 --> 02:55:16.850
As it finishes, the flame
has been split the entirety

02:55:16.850 --> 02:55:18.300
and has no effect
on the wall.

02:55:18.330 --> 02:55:20.470
TRAVIS: Holy shit.

02:55:21.330 --> 02:55:22.650
LAURA: I wonder--

02:55:24.570 --> 02:55:27.270
I wonder if the
beehive thing above us,

02:55:27.300 --> 02:55:30.180
that the holes are
covered in magic as well.

02:55:30.570 --> 02:55:31.960
TRAVIS: Are you conscious?

02:55:31.960 --> 02:55:33.510
LAURA: Am I-- I am conscious.

02:55:33.510 --> 02:55:36.510
TALIESIN: I say, well, maybe killing
the eggs, I don't know.

02:55:36.540 --> 02:55:38.150
Kill the eggs.

02:55:38.180 --> 02:55:39.750
MATT: Pike.

02:55:39.780 --> 02:55:41.090
TRAVIS: Or maybe it's like a
Pacific Rim--

02:55:41.090 --> 02:55:43.270
LAURA: But I don't know
what that says.

02:55:43.300 --> 02:55:45.210
SAM: I--I can give it to you.

02:55:45.240 --> 02:55:47.600
LAURA: But it's now.

02:55:47.630 --> 02:55:52.210
My question is,
Pike runs up, thank you.

02:55:52.240 --> 02:55:53.870
Oh, oh!

02:55:53.870 --> 02:55:55.810
If she runs up, is
she gonna be able

02:55:55.840 --> 02:55:58.670
to get her hand
on-- on Scanlan?

02:56:00.390 --> 02:56:02.080
MATT: Well, she was--

02:56:03.510 --> 02:56:06.150
She was prone, right?

02:56:06.180 --> 02:56:08.090
She just came back
to consciousness.

02:56:08.120 --> 02:56:09.360
So she gets up
for half her movement.

02:56:09.390 --> 02:56:11.240
TALIESIN: We got a minute.

02:56:15.810 --> 02:56:17.150
Got a minute.

02:56:17.180 --> 02:56:19.180
TRAVIS: I would have picked
her up after the last time.

02:56:19.210 --> 02:56:22.090
I was being pissed about-- I
mean, you know, she's so tiny.

02:56:22.120 --> 02:56:24.360
MATT: Being a gnome, it's
one of those things

02:56:24.390 --> 02:56:26.090
where 25 feet halved

02:56:26.120 --> 02:56:29.480
and you always round on
the lower end of the scale.

02:56:29.510 --> 02:56:32.420
At ten feet, she's not close
enough to touch Scanlan.

02:56:32.450 --> 02:56:33.510
Yet.

02:56:33.540 --> 02:56:34.850
MARISHA: Even with the
Sprinter's Boots?

02:56:34.850 --> 02:56:36.690
MATT: Sprinter's Boots
already got used.

02:56:36.720 --> 02:56:38.150
It's got one round use.

02:56:38.180 --> 02:56:40.180
LAURA: She says "She can use the
Sprinter's Boots twice"

02:56:40.210 --> 02:56:42.000
in all caps.

02:56:42.030 --> 02:56:43.530
MATT: Alright then.

02:56:43.530 --> 02:56:45.710
TALIESIN: The caps are what
make it worthwhile.

02:56:45.710 --> 02:56:47.170
MATT: I'll trust her.

02:56:47.170 --> 02:56:48.600
TRAVIS: She's on a 30 second delay

02:56:48.630 --> 02:56:49.690
so she wrote that
before we said it.

02:56:49.720 --> 02:56:52.060
LAURA: Actually she did write
that before we said it.

02:56:52.060 --> 02:56:53.390
-MATT: Good, alright then.

02:56:53.420 --> 02:56:56.690
Then that will be just enough
to put her up next to Scanlan.

02:56:56.720 --> 02:56:58.270
LAURA: Okay.

02:56:58.300 --> 02:57:02.450
So, Pike puts her hands on
either side of his face

02:57:02.480 --> 02:57:06.870
and says, "Scanlan.

02:57:07.000 --> 02:57:10.300
Your letter to me
was wonderful

02:57:10.330 --> 02:57:12.600
and I want to do
what you asked

02:57:12.630 --> 02:57:16.180
but I can't raise Kaylee alone,
I need you to come back."

02:57:16.210 --> 02:57:17.810
And she casts
Revivify on him.

02:57:17.840 --> 02:57:19.180
MATT: Okay.

02:57:19.210 --> 02:57:20.600
Go ahead and
roll a d20.

02:57:25.750 --> 02:57:27.360
LAURA: I'm so scared.

02:57:33.330 --> 02:57:34.780
Thirteen?

02:57:34.810 --> 02:57:36.870
MATT: Thirteen, okay.

02:57:40.540 --> 02:57:44.780
As she implores to
the spirit of Scanlan

02:57:44.810 --> 02:57:46.180
in this frozen form,

02:57:48.450 --> 02:57:53.120
you watch as
the icy crystals

02:57:53.150 --> 02:57:55.270
that have coalesced
around his form

02:57:55.300 --> 02:57:58.300
and locked him in his place,
his face kind of--

02:57:58.330 --> 02:58:01.150
This frozen
look of horror.

02:58:01.180 --> 02:58:03.750
The ice begins to turn
into mist around him

02:58:03.780 --> 02:58:08.000
and his color begins
to return to his skin.

02:58:08.030 --> 02:58:11.200
His expression relaxes
as his eyes suddenly focus

02:58:11.200 --> 02:58:13.630
and Scanlan, you find
yourself conscious again

02:58:13.660 --> 02:58:15.180
looking up at Pike.

02:58:15.210 --> 02:58:19.240
Tears in her eyes, pulling her
hand back from your shoulder.

02:58:19.270 --> 02:58:22.090
Looking up into
the dark, you know,

02:58:22.120 --> 02:58:25.600
glowing lit interior
of Thordak's lair.

02:58:27.840 --> 02:58:29.140
SAM: Don't cry.

02:58:30.600 --> 02:58:32.780
I'm just a little cold.

02:58:32.810 --> 02:58:34.240
LAURA: "Warm up.

02:58:34.270 --> 02:58:36.120
Does anybody
have a blanket?"

02:58:36.150 --> 02:58:38.570
-SAM: "Just hold me."
-LAURA: "Okay."

02:58:38.570 --> 02:58:40.840
-TRAVIS: She sent a picture.
-LAURA: She did.

02:58:40.840 --> 02:58:43.000
She sent a picture
of the Sprinter's Boots cards

02:58:43.030 --> 02:58:44.000
with two uses.

02:58:44.030 --> 02:58:45.270
TRAVIS: "Used twice
while in rest..."

02:58:45.300 --> 02:58:46.420
MATT: There we go.

02:58:46.450 --> 02:58:49.750
Cool, that's what
I wanted, thank you.

02:58:49.780 --> 02:58:52.390
So make sure everyone has
their equipment cards on them.

02:58:52.420 --> 02:58:55.270
Alright, so that
finishes Pike's turn.

02:58:55.300 --> 02:58:58.480
Scanlan, you're
conscious now.

02:59:02.390 --> 02:59:03.490
SAM: Hi.

02:59:03.490 --> 02:59:06.150
TRAVIS: Welcome back, we're
still fucked by the way.

02:59:06.180 --> 02:59:07.420
SAM: What's going on?

02:59:07.450 --> 02:59:08.780
TRAVIS: They sealed us in here

02:59:08.810 --> 02:59:11.690
with a giant magic
screen across this door.

02:59:11.720 --> 02:59:14.570
Dragon's breath does
nothing, Kima does nothing.

02:59:14.600 --> 02:59:16.630
You know anything
about this?

02:59:16.660 --> 02:59:21.030
Any limericks for
magic cave doors?

02:59:21.060 --> 02:59:22.270
SAM: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

02:59:22.300 --> 02:59:23.870
LAURA: Glad you're
back, Scanlan.

02:59:24.000 --> 02:59:26.510
SAM: Thanks, thanks.

02:59:26.540 --> 02:59:31.150
I've got one
thing up my sleeve.

02:59:31.180 --> 02:59:33.810
It's a dog that can
run around and help us.

02:59:33.840 --> 02:59:35.330
That's about it.

02:59:35.980 --> 02:59:38.480
LAURA: Are we gonna have
to take a short rest?

02:59:38.510 --> 02:59:39.540
TALIESIN: No.

02:59:39.570 --> 02:59:41.090
SAM: I don't know,
I don't know.

02:59:41.120 --> 02:59:42.480
What-- there's
magic there?

02:59:42.510 --> 02:59:43.600
I can't do
anything about that.

02:59:43.630 --> 02:59:45.450
LAURA: Can I-- can I--
I know I'm gonna--

02:59:45.480 --> 02:59:47.420
Can I broom up
to the holes?

02:59:47.450 --> 02:59:49.210
God, I'm so scared to
get on this broom again.

02:59:49.240 --> 02:59:51.120
TALIESIN: Well, it's not--
we're still--

02:59:51.150 --> 02:59:53.000
LAURA: Oh, in our order?

02:59:53.030 --> 02:59:55.160
MARISHA: We're still
going in order?

02:59:55.160 --> 02:59:58.540
MARISHA: Do you still have a Mansion?

02:59:58.540 --> 03:00:01.210
MATT: Well, right now, as we're
getting back into this.

03:00:01.240 --> 03:00:02.660
Percy, what are you doing?

03:00:02.690 --> 03:00:03.720
MARISHA: I have a crazy plan.

03:00:03.750 --> 03:00:05.090
LAURA: Did you let the dog out?

03:00:05.120 --> 03:00:06.420
SAM: No, I don't know what--

03:00:06.450 --> 03:00:07.780
TRAVIS: Who let the dog out?

03:00:07.810 --> 03:00:10.570
LAURA: Scanlan, did you
let the dog out?

03:00:10.600 --> 03:00:12.180
SAM: Keyleth, do you
have a crazy plan?

03:00:12.210 --> 03:00:15.450
MARISHA: You only have
to cast the Mansion Door

03:00:15.480 --> 03:00:17.690
within line of
sight, correct?

03:00:17.720 --> 03:00:19.570
SAM: Yes.

03:00:19.600 --> 03:00:21.520
MARISHA: Okay.

03:00:21.520 --> 03:00:23.720
SAM: I don't know that
that's true actually.

03:00:23.750 --> 03:00:26.180
Three hundred feet,
300 feet range.

03:00:26.210 --> 03:00:27.630
LAURA: Do you have it left?

03:00:27.660 --> 03:00:28.630
-SAM: I do.
-TALIESIN: Yeah.

03:00:28.660 --> 03:00:30.150
MARISHA: Okay, two things.

03:00:30.180 --> 03:00:34.720
One, before we start burning
our seventh level spells,

03:00:34.750 --> 03:00:36.480
I still have
Stone Shape.

03:00:36.510 --> 03:00:40.240
Can Keyleth go up to the
wall and do I have enough--

03:00:40.270 --> 03:00:42.540
is there just enough
room in the corridor walls

03:00:42.540 --> 03:00:43.840
that I could
Stone Shape--

03:00:43.840 --> 03:00:45.740
SAM: I could Dimension Door
out of here.

03:00:45.740 --> 03:00:47.030
LAURA: Why would you just--

03:00:47.030 --> 03:00:48.330
LIAM: You get a tunnel
for all of us, mate.

03:00:48.360 --> 03:00:50.150
SAM: Yeah, that would just be me.

03:00:50.150 --> 03:00:53.690
MARISHA: Can I Stone Shape a tunnel
kind of around the thing?

03:00:53.720 --> 03:00:54.550
Or is--

03:00:55.080 --> 03:00:56.830
MATT: First things first,

03:00:56.830 --> 03:00:58.540
Mordenkainen's
Magnificent Mansion

03:00:58.570 --> 03:01:00.390
is a one minute
casting time.

03:01:00.420 --> 03:01:03.090
MARISHA: Okay.

03:01:03.120 --> 03:01:05.180
MATT: So you could do it, but
in the process of doing so,

03:01:05.210 --> 03:01:07.390
you'd probably go through
about 10 different lair actions

03:01:07.400 --> 03:01:08.590
in here.

03:01:08.590 --> 03:01:10.000
TALIESIN: Yeah, there's that.

03:01:10.000 --> 03:01:12.660
MATT: So, Keyleth, you're using,
you said, stone--

03:01:12.690 --> 03:01:16.480
MARISHA: Can I Stone Shape a
little passage around?

03:01:16.510 --> 03:01:20.030
Do I have just enough
kinda to where I can--

03:01:20.060 --> 03:01:23.240
where the barrier is
I can kind of carve

03:01:23.270 --> 03:01:25.060
a little corridor around?

03:01:25.090 --> 03:01:26.890
LIAM: Around or under?

03:01:29.300 --> 03:01:31.690
MATT: It would be very tiny

03:01:31.720 --> 03:01:34.630
and you'd have to crawl
through to create enough--

03:01:34.660 --> 03:01:37.060
Cause you're not quite sure
how thick the barrier is,

03:01:37.090 --> 03:01:39.810
so you have to be--

03:01:39.840 --> 03:01:41.060
have to roll an
investigation check

03:01:41.090 --> 03:01:43.360
and based on your
roll, I'll let you know.

03:01:43.390 --> 03:01:45.390
MARISHA: Okay.

03:01:45.420 --> 03:01:47.720
TALIESIN: This is a plan.

03:01:47.750 --> 03:01:48.870
MARISHA: Eight.

03:01:49.000 --> 03:01:50.030
MATT: Eight?

03:01:50.060 --> 03:01:51.540
You're not sure,
you can give it a shot.

03:01:51.570 --> 03:01:53.360
MARISHA: I'm-- might as well
give it a shot, I mean--

03:01:53.390 --> 03:01:55.000
MATT: Before it gets to you, it does
come back to a lair action.

03:01:55.030 --> 03:01:56.000
LAURA: Wait, but--

03:01:56.030 --> 03:01:57.810
SAM: On my turn,
I drank a potion.

03:01:57.840 --> 03:01:59.360
MATT: Okay, so take
your healing.

03:01:59.390 --> 03:02:00.750
SAM: That's it.

03:02:00.780 --> 03:02:03.090
TALIESIN: Has my
turn not come up yet?

03:02:03.120 --> 03:02:05.750
LAURA: I hate that we can't get
out of this fucking area!

03:02:05.780 --> 03:02:07.510
MATT: Sorry, I asked
you what you were doing.

03:02:07.540 --> 03:02:09.720
TALIESIN: Oh, I want to
try something stupid.

03:02:09.750 --> 03:02:10.840
MATT: What do you want to try?

03:02:10.870 --> 03:02:13.600
TALIESIN: I want to try and run
headlong at the barrier.

03:02:13.600 --> 03:02:14.540
MATT: Okay.

03:02:14.570 --> 03:02:15.780
Well, you have to--

03:02:17.110 --> 03:02:19.550
LAURA: Don't get too close
into this area, Percy,

03:02:19.550 --> 03:02:22.060
cause this is where the fucking
lair action keeps coming up.

03:02:22.060 --> 03:02:23.420
TALIESIN: I want to stay
on the wall.

03:02:23.450 --> 03:02:24.420
MATT: Stay on the wall, okay.

03:02:24.450 --> 03:02:26.120
Leaving you roughly there.

03:02:26.150 --> 03:02:27.630
So even a full turn,

03:02:27.660 --> 03:02:29.300
that's as far as you could
get on a double run.

03:02:29.330 --> 03:02:31.810
TALIESIN: Yeah, and I'm up
on the wall still.

03:02:31.840 --> 03:02:33.390
MATT: Cool.

03:02:33.420 --> 03:02:35.750
Alright, now--
now this happens.

03:02:38.870 --> 03:02:42.150
With this, the
quakiness of the lair

03:02:42.180 --> 03:02:45.420
seems to be subsiding
a little bit.

03:02:45.450 --> 03:02:49.300
There is a tremor
on the ground.

03:02:49.330 --> 03:02:51.270
It only effects those
directly around the barrier,

03:02:51.300 --> 03:02:53.420
so that's my people.

03:02:57.140 --> 03:02:59.300
Everyone succeeds,
so no one falls prone.

03:02:59.330 --> 03:03:02.060
So no effect on that
lair action, per se.

03:03:05.450 --> 03:03:07.400
Alright, past that.

03:03:09.600 --> 03:03:11.870
You can see in
the distance,

03:03:12.000 --> 03:03:13.840
past the wall,
dark in the tunnel,

03:03:13.870 --> 03:03:15.720
which is almost pitch
black beyond the radius,

03:03:15.750 --> 03:03:18.210
you see this slight
purplish glow

03:03:18.240 --> 03:03:19.420
and then a flash
of purple energy.

03:03:19.450 --> 03:03:21.180
TALIESIN: God, fucking damn it!

03:03:21.180 --> 03:03:22.750
MARISHA: Talking to Thordak!

03:03:22.750 --> 03:03:23.960
SAM: Should I go?

03:03:23.960 --> 03:03:25.750
LAURA: What are you gonna do?

03:03:25.750 --> 03:03:27.150
SAM: Distract it, do something.

03:03:27.150 --> 03:03:28.710
TRAVIS: You're gonna be
all by yourself.

03:03:28.710 --> 03:03:30.440
MARISHA: Okay, I'm gonna
Stone Shape

03:03:30.440 --> 03:03:32.030
and try and just
cast a little,

03:03:32.060 --> 03:03:34.510
even if it's a corridor
just right around.

03:03:34.510 --> 03:03:37.240
MATT: It's a touch spell so
you have to get up to it,

03:03:37.270 --> 03:03:40.420
so you're back there.

03:03:40.450 --> 03:03:43.420
So you just get up to
the edge of the doorway

03:03:43.450 --> 03:03:45.060
and the wall
with a double run.

03:03:45.090 --> 03:03:46.420
-MARISHA: Okay.
-MATT: Okay?

03:03:46.450 --> 03:03:48.890
MARISHA: I'm go ahead and
can I use a bonus action.

03:03:48.890 --> 03:03:50.000
MATT: Yeah.

03:03:51.450 --> 03:03:53.690
MARISHA: I'm gonna use
my-- no, no, no,

03:03:53.720 --> 03:03:56.300
I'm gonna just drink a
healing potion real quick.

03:03:56.330 --> 03:03:58.210
Just one of my Greaters.

03:03:58.240 --> 03:04:00.240
MATT: Okay, go for it.

03:04:00.270 --> 03:04:02.110
So it is 4d4 plus four.

03:04:04.480 --> 03:04:05.660
Alright.

03:04:05.690 --> 03:04:07.600
Gilmore.

03:04:09.830 --> 03:04:12.070
TALIESIN: This poor book
has seen better days.

03:04:12.070 --> 03:04:14.120
MATT: Gilmore doesn't
really have anything

03:04:14.150 --> 03:04:16.150
that can be of
aid right now.

03:04:16.150 --> 03:04:18.150
MATT: Gilmore moves
over towards you.

03:04:18.150 --> 03:04:19.870
Preparing for
what you're up to,

03:04:19.870 --> 03:04:22.630
and just kind of puts his hand
on your shoulder, Keyleth,

03:04:22.660 --> 03:04:25.420
and goes, "Whatever you're
doing, I'm right behind you.

03:04:25.450 --> 03:04:26.820
Don't worry."

03:04:27.280 --> 03:04:29.210
TALIESIN: Hold you up so
you don't fall.

03:04:29.240 --> 03:04:30.840
MATT: Grog, you're up.

03:04:30.870 --> 03:04:32.300
MARISHA: I'm not feeling very
confident right now.

03:04:32.330 --> 03:04:35.240
TRAVIS: You look like you're up to
something, do you have a plan?

03:04:35.240 --> 03:04:38.330
MARISHA: I'm trying to Stone Shape
a corridor through this,

03:04:38.360 --> 03:04:40.270
but I don't know if
it's going to be enough

03:04:40.300 --> 03:04:41.660
to get through
the thickness.

03:04:41.690 --> 03:04:43.720
-TRAVIS: Right, as a backup plan...

03:04:43.750 --> 03:04:45.810
TRAVIS: How big is
J'Mon Sa Ord?

03:04:45.840 --> 03:04:47.810
Like a big dragon
or just like eh?

03:04:47.840 --> 03:04:51.150
MATT: About the same
size as Raishan.

03:04:51.180 --> 03:04:53.720
TRAVIS: So, we couldn't like
all Falcor on J'Mon

03:04:53.750 --> 03:04:56.720
up to the spider network of
tunnels in the ceiling, right?

03:04:56.750 --> 03:04:58.300
Like we couldn't ride him.

03:04:58.330 --> 03:05:02.420
MATT: Raishan and J'Mon have a
very similar physicality.

03:05:02.450 --> 03:05:05.270
Like their bodies can, much
like a cat can get really thin,

03:05:05.270 --> 03:05:07.720
just enough to fit
through the tunnels, maybe,

03:05:07.720 --> 03:05:09.040
but not with any riders.

03:05:09.040 --> 03:05:10.850
You guys would probably
be squeezed off

03:05:10.850 --> 03:05:12.480
or crushed in
the process.

03:05:12.510 --> 03:05:13.780
TRAVIS: Could she get us up there

03:05:13.810 --> 03:05:16.130
and then follow us up
through the tunnels if we--

03:05:16.130 --> 03:05:18.030
TALIESIN: We don't know
where they go.

03:05:18.030 --> 03:05:20.030
TRAVIS: It's better
than this place.

03:05:20.060 --> 03:05:21.360
They're exhaust tunnels.

03:05:21.390 --> 03:05:22.660
TALIESIN: That's fair, although I
will say, before we leave,

03:05:22.690 --> 03:05:24.330
we should probably make
sure all those eggs are down

03:05:24.360 --> 03:05:26.870
-before we leave anyway.
-TRAVIS: That's my idea.

03:05:26.870 --> 03:05:30.620
And then, I'm
gonna end my turn.

03:05:30.620 --> 03:05:32.350
LAURA: Are you gonna run
and hit an egg?

03:05:32.350 --> 03:05:33.320
TRAVIS: Oh, yeah!

03:05:33.320 --> 03:05:35.170
LAURA: There's an egg
left over there.

03:05:35.170 --> 03:05:37.290
-TALIESIN: Hit an egg.
-TRAVIS: Shamone!

03:05:37.290 --> 03:05:39.020
Yeah, I'll just
run towards egg.

03:05:39.020 --> 03:05:39.610
Ooh!

03:05:39.610 --> 03:05:41.780
I'm gonna use all three
of my attacks on that egg.

03:05:41.810 --> 03:05:43.810
MATT: Go for it.

03:05:43.840 --> 03:05:45.180
Go for it.

03:05:45.210 --> 03:05:47.270
MARISHA: Egg doesn't know
what's coming.

03:05:47.300 --> 03:05:49.870
TRAVIS: That's a-- that's a 33.

03:05:50.000 --> 03:05:52.180
-MATT: That'll hit.
-TRAVIS: Oh, minus five.

03:05:52.210 --> 03:05:53.840
Okay.

03:06:02.090 --> 03:06:06.330
That's a 31, no, 39.

03:06:06.360 --> 03:06:08.540
MATT: Okay, so the first strike

03:06:08.570 --> 03:06:10.750
just cleaves through
the egg entirely.

03:06:10.780 --> 03:06:12.570
-TRAVIS: Oh.
-MATT: I know.

03:06:12.600 --> 03:06:16.150
You impact at the point of the
bullet that Percy left earlier,

03:06:16.180 --> 03:06:19.030
which kind of left that
spider web crack in the front

03:06:19.030 --> 03:06:21.330
and that just causes
the entire thing to buckle

03:06:21.360 --> 03:06:23.840
under the sheer force
of your axe as it swings.

03:06:23.870 --> 03:06:26.270
The egg gets cut
in half, tumbles over,

03:06:26.300 --> 03:06:30.360
splattering primordial
dragon whelp gore

03:06:30.390 --> 03:06:32.390
and you can see
the remnants inside

03:06:32.420 --> 03:06:35.100
of what is now a two-parter
primordial dragon whelp.

03:06:35.100 --> 03:06:36.640
LAURA: Did it look
like Thordak?

03:06:36.640 --> 03:06:38.830
TRAVIS: Did any dragon parts
spill out of the egg?

03:06:38.830 --> 03:06:40.630
MATT: Yeah, as it flew
off and kind--

03:06:40.660 --> 03:06:42.750
TRAVIS: Could I grab a piece
of it, take a step back

03:06:42.780 --> 03:06:45.390
and try and like throw
it towards the wall

03:06:45.420 --> 03:06:47.690
to see if it bounces
off as well?

03:06:47.720 --> 03:06:50.120
Just in case it's like a,
you know, lair barcode?

03:06:50.150 --> 03:06:51.270
MATT: Sure.

03:06:51.300 --> 03:06:53.000
TRAVIS: Hey, we got through!

03:06:53.000 --> 03:06:54.660
MARISHA: They got the key card.

03:06:54.690 --> 03:06:56.840
TALIESIN: Multi-pass.

03:06:56.870 --> 03:07:00.240
MATT: As you pull it up,
and this creature is,

03:07:00.270 --> 03:07:02.240
nearly identical to the one
that you pulled out earlier.

03:07:02.270 --> 03:07:06.690
It's still deep red crimson,

03:07:06.720 --> 03:07:10.540
but like fully, fully
primordial in its visual.

03:07:10.540 --> 03:07:13.240
You take back a chunk of it
and you throw it at the wall

03:07:13.270 --> 03:07:15.240
and it just
passes through.

03:07:15.270 --> 03:07:16.080
(gasps)

03:07:16.080 --> 03:07:17.130
SAM: What just happened?

03:07:17.130 --> 03:07:18.750
-MARISHA: Shut up!
-LAURA: You were right!

03:07:18.780 --> 03:07:20.170
SAM: What did he just do?

03:07:20.170 --> 03:07:21.950
TALIESIN: You solved it!

03:07:21.950 --> 03:07:23.450
SAM: How, what did he do?

03:07:23.480 --> 03:07:25.060
LIAM: Destroying the last egg.

03:07:25.090 --> 03:07:26.720
SAM: Fucking guy!

03:07:26.750 --> 03:07:28.030
LAURA: Or by--

03:07:28.060 --> 03:07:30.060
MARISHA: Or by-- it's
like he said.

03:07:30.090 --> 03:07:31.390
We cover ourselves
in dragon goo

03:07:31.420 --> 03:07:32.480
and then we
can walk through.

03:07:32.510 --> 03:07:33.780
TALIESIN: One of the two.

03:07:33.810 --> 03:07:35.720
TRAVIS: Residual goo in my hand, I just
like rub it all on my face.

03:07:35.750 --> 03:07:37.120
MATT: It smells terrible.

03:07:37.150 --> 03:07:38.120
TALIESIN: You can hop in the egg.

03:07:38.150 --> 03:07:39.300
It's basically
a hot tub.

03:07:39.330 --> 03:07:41.180
MARISHA: We didn't destroy
all the eggs, right?

03:07:41.210 --> 03:07:43.120
MATT: Currently, you destroyed
three of them

03:07:43.150 --> 03:07:46.270
and two were
lightning baked

03:07:46.300 --> 03:07:47.900
and taken off
by Raishan.

03:07:47.900 --> 03:07:49.300
SAM: My voice
is my passport.

03:07:49.330 --> 03:07:50.600
MARISHA: So, do it.

03:07:50.630 --> 03:07:52.570
It's hard to say.

03:07:52.600 --> 03:07:54.250
TALIESIN: I love that movie.

03:07:54.250 --> 03:07:55.920
LAURA: Maybe we should
hold onto a piece

03:07:55.920 --> 03:07:57.120
and try to
pass through it.

03:07:57.150 --> 03:07:58.390
TALIESIN: Hello.

03:07:58.420 --> 03:07:59.750
MATT: Well, that
finishes Grog's turn.

03:07:59.780 --> 03:08:00.840
Vex?

03:08:00.870 --> 03:08:02.410
LAURA: That's me.

03:08:03.570 --> 03:08:06.410
I used a level-- did I use
a level four spell already?

03:08:06.410 --> 03:08:07.130
Shit.

03:08:07.130 --> 03:08:09.670
MATT: I'm pretty sure you guys
went down guns blazing.

03:08:09.670 --> 03:08:11.690
TALIESIN: Somewhere in the world, there's
a whole chatroom of people

03:08:11.690 --> 03:08:13.330
yelling at you
telling you--

03:08:13.360 --> 03:08:14.360
LAURA: Oh, that's
right, I did.

03:08:14.390 --> 03:08:15.850
I did use it
cause I was--

03:08:15.850 --> 03:08:17.690
MARISHA: Yeah, I was gonna
say, "somewhere"?

03:08:17.720 --> 03:08:19.540
LAURA: So I have a
level three left.

03:08:19.570 --> 03:08:20.870
Who needs healing?

03:08:21.000 --> 03:08:23.150
Me and Pike
and everybody.

03:08:23.180 --> 03:08:25.270
TALIESIN: There's always--
everybody needs healing.

03:08:25.300 --> 03:08:26.810
-MARISHA: Me.
-LAURA: You do.

03:08:26.810 --> 03:08:28.250
SAM: I got single
dig going on.

03:08:28.250 --> 03:08:29.810
LAURA: So do I, I got five.

03:08:29.840 --> 03:08:31.060
TRAVIS: Single dig.

03:08:31.090 --> 03:08:32.650
LAURA: I got five points,
how many you got?

03:08:32.650 --> 03:08:35.030
SAM: I got eight or nine,
I can't remember my math.

03:08:35.060 --> 03:08:37.000
It's pretty bad.

03:08:37.030 --> 03:08:40.630
Wait, if I had one,
plus eight would be nine.

03:08:40.660 --> 03:08:42.410
LAURA: So you have
nine points.

03:08:42.410 --> 03:08:44.030
I'm gonna take
a healing potion.

03:08:44.030 --> 03:08:46.210
I mean, I'm gonna cast
Cure Wounds on myself.

03:08:46.240 --> 03:08:48.480
-MATT: Okay.
-SAM: Oh, yeah, you do your thing.

03:08:48.510 --> 03:08:51.210
MATT: 3d8 plus whatever your
modifier is, go for it.

03:08:52.630 --> 03:08:54.270
TALIESIN: It's all good.

03:08:55.690 --> 03:08:57.120
MARISHA: Kind of.

03:08:57.150 --> 03:09:00.100
TALIESIN: No, it's not, I know,
but like, it's looking better.

03:09:00.100 --> 03:09:01.810
MARISHA: Well, we're not all dead.

03:09:01.810 --> 03:09:03.710
We just can't die anymore.

03:09:03.710 --> 03:09:06.570
TALIESIN: And worst case scenario, we're
stuck in here for another round.

03:09:06.600 --> 03:09:08.120
LAURA: So, 20 points.

03:09:08.150 --> 03:09:10.210
-MATT: Twenty points, okay.
-LAURA: Okay.

03:09:10.240 --> 03:09:12.390
TALIESIN: And you didn't
even burn a spell yet.

03:09:12.390 --> 03:09:13.630
LAURA: Can I run over

03:09:13.660 --> 03:09:15.540
and get some
dragon guts on my hand

03:09:15.570 --> 03:09:18.660
and then to try to put
my hand through the thingy?

03:09:18.690 --> 03:09:20.750
MATT: With your speed and getting up,
cause you were prone.

03:09:20.780 --> 03:09:22.580
LAURA: Please let me
out of this spot.

03:09:22.580 --> 03:09:23.900
MATT: That close right there.

03:09:23.900 --> 03:09:25.360
You can't quite get
to the dragon guts.

03:09:25.360 --> 03:09:26.660
That's as far
as you can get.

03:09:26.690 --> 03:09:28.300
TALIESIN: It may just
be that it's down now,

03:09:28.330 --> 03:09:29.660
but it may be
the dragon guts.

03:09:29.690 --> 03:09:31.240
MATT: Alright, so that
ends Vex's turn, Vax.

03:09:31.270 --> 03:09:32.420
Whatcha doing?

03:09:32.450 --> 03:09:34.400
LIAM: I'm just gonna move
towards the gate.

03:09:34.400 --> 03:09:36.280
Put my hand out and
see if I can go through

03:09:36.280 --> 03:09:37.300
or if I get stopped.

03:09:37.330 --> 03:09:39.060
MATT: You walk right through.

03:09:39.090 --> 03:09:40.120
TALIESIN: Alright!

03:09:40.150 --> 03:09:41.210
LAURA: Oh!

03:09:41.240 --> 03:09:43.120
MARISHA: It's the eggs,
it was the eggs.

03:09:43.120 --> 03:09:44.360
LIAM: Alright, everybody!

03:09:44.390 --> 03:09:46.120
Quietly.

03:09:46.150 --> 03:09:48.400
MARISHA: Hang on, hang on.

03:09:49.570 --> 03:09:52.720
I'm feeling very guilty
because it was my rage

03:09:52.750 --> 03:09:55.090
and anger and
want for vengeance

03:09:55.120 --> 03:09:58.750
which made me run in here
blindly towards her,

03:09:58.780 --> 03:10:01.160
maybe we shouldn't do it
again is all I'm saying.

03:10:01.160 --> 03:10:02.190
TALIESIN: No, too late.

03:10:02.190 --> 03:10:03.450
Got to finish this off.

03:10:03.480 --> 03:10:04.570
MARISHA: Okay.

03:10:04.600 --> 03:10:06.990
LAURA: Does your guilt have
a Mass Cure Wounds?

03:10:06.990 --> 03:10:09.300
In that case,
doesn't matter.

03:10:09.330 --> 03:10:11.110
MATT: "Forward, now!"

03:10:11.120 --> 03:10:13.570
And all of you
just start...

03:10:13.600 --> 03:10:16.420
MARISHA: Avengers Run
down the hall.

03:10:16.450 --> 03:10:18.390
MATT: Like crawling
over all of you.

03:10:18.420 --> 03:10:20.330
TALIESIN: Avengers, it's
clobbering time.

03:10:20.360 --> 03:10:24.450
SAM: I--I grab Kima and I say,
"Get ready to hit a dragon,"

03:10:24.480 --> 03:10:27.850
and I'm gonna Dimension Door
me and Kima to Thordak's body.

03:10:27.850 --> 03:10:29.520
-MATT: Okay.
-LAURA: Oh, geez.

03:10:29.520 --> 03:10:31.030
MATT: Kima goes, "Wait, what?"

03:10:31.060 --> 03:10:32.870
As soon as you
grab the shoulder

03:10:33.000 --> 03:10:34.690
and you both
suddenly vanish

03:10:34.720 --> 03:10:37.240
and reappear at
Thordak's body.

03:10:37.270 --> 03:10:40.540
You both land with
a flash of arcane light.

03:10:40.570 --> 03:10:43.000
As your feet
hit the ground,

03:10:43.030 --> 03:10:46.000
it is an empty tunnel.

03:10:46.030 --> 03:10:47.480
So, no Raishan.

03:10:47.510 --> 03:10:49.480
-There is no Thordak corpse.
-LAURA: Fuck.

03:10:49.510 --> 03:10:51.820
-SAM: There's no Thordak's corpse?
-MARISHA: There's no Thordak's corpse?

03:10:51.820 --> 03:10:54.120
-MATT: Correct.
-LAURA: Fuck!

03:10:54.150 --> 03:10:55.180
Fuck.

03:10:55.210 --> 03:10:57.040
LIAM: She just wanted
to talk to it.

03:10:57.040 --> 03:10:59.090
TALIESIN: She may have
taken him somewhere.

03:10:59.120 --> 03:11:00.570
TRAVIS: Talk to it, my ass.

03:11:00.570 --> 03:11:02.060
She didn't want
to talk to it.

03:11:02.060 --> 03:11:03.700
MARISHA: Or she raised him.

03:11:03.700 --> 03:11:05.320
Jesus.

03:11:05.330 --> 03:11:07.090
LIAM: One last roll
in the hay.

03:11:07.120 --> 03:11:09.920
MATT: As you guys approach, Gilmore
steps up and goes,

03:11:09.920 --> 03:11:11.660
"I think I have
a pretty good idea

03:11:11.690 --> 03:11:13.240
what that flash
we saw was."

03:11:13.270 --> 03:11:15.020
-MARISHA: What?
-TALIESIN: Teleport.

03:11:15.020 --> 03:11:17.000
MATT: "Getting the
hell out of here.

03:11:17.030 --> 03:11:18.840
Son of a bitch!"

03:11:18.870 --> 03:11:20.840
He takes a rock
and throws it.

03:11:20.870 --> 03:11:21.870
Hair's kind
of tussled.

03:11:21.870 --> 03:11:24.390
MARISHA: Vex, can you sense
dragons anywhere nearby?

03:11:24.390 --> 03:11:28.720
LAURA: Can I sense anyone but J'Mon Sa
Ord as far as dragons go nearby?

03:11:28.750 --> 03:11:31.600
I drop down to my
knees and concentrate.

03:11:31.630 --> 03:11:33.270
-MATT: No.
-LAURA: Nothing!

03:11:33.300 --> 03:11:34.300
Nothing.

03:11:34.330 --> 03:11:36.610
She's nowhere.

03:11:37.690 --> 03:11:38.790
Fuck.

03:11:38.790 --> 03:11:41.290
MATT: And that's where we'll
end tonight's episode.

03:11:41.290 --> 03:11:43.360
(all groaning)

03:11:43.390 --> 03:11:45.570
We have a flight
early in the morning.

03:11:45.600 --> 03:11:46.840
TRAVIS: Oh!

03:11:46.870 --> 03:11:49.600
LAURA: I can't believe
that we all came back.

03:11:49.630 --> 03:11:51.580
TALIESIN: I can't believe
we all lived.

03:11:51.580 --> 03:11:53.360
MATT: I can't believe
you all lived.

03:11:53.360 --> 03:11:55.360
TALIESIN: That should
not have happened.

03:11:55.360 --> 03:11:56.810
MARISHA: That was
really scary.

03:11:56.840 --> 03:11:59.000
LAURA: It was just
giant clusterfuck

03:11:59.030 --> 03:12:00.480
from like halfway through

03:12:00.510 --> 03:12:02.270
with just everybody
falling down

03:12:02.270 --> 03:12:03.700
and trying
to get back up.

03:12:03.700 --> 03:12:05.650
MATT: Well, if--

03:12:07.100 --> 03:12:08.720
If you had fallen
into the lava,

03:12:08.750 --> 03:12:11.500
by the way, if you
had rolled poorly,

03:12:11.500 --> 03:12:14.000
you would have been submerged
in lava, which was...

03:12:14.030 --> 03:12:15.600
LAURA: Unconscious.

03:12:15.630 --> 03:12:19.630
MATT: Well, that-- that's
18d10 points of damage.

03:12:19.660 --> 03:12:21.640
If that had exceeded
your max hit points,

03:12:21.640 --> 03:12:24.000
you would have been instantly
dead and turned to ash.

03:12:24.000 --> 03:12:26.020
LIAM: Been nice if I'd
cut out her tongue.

03:12:26.020 --> 03:12:27.460
LAURA: So, gone, gone-gone.

03:12:27.460 --> 03:12:28.260
-MATT: Yeah.

03:12:28.260 --> 03:12:30.150
There were a
few close calls there.

03:12:30.150 --> 03:12:31.650
TRAVIS: She was like three.

03:12:31.650 --> 03:12:33.150
I think there
were like nine.

03:12:33.150 --> 03:12:34.390
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:12:34.420 --> 03:12:37.730
LAURA: And then if you hadn't
counter spelled the color...

03:12:37.730 --> 03:12:39.610
MATT: Oh, yeah, the
Prismatic Spray.

03:12:39.610 --> 03:12:41.030
That would have
been real bad.

03:12:41.060 --> 03:12:43.330
SAM: Who was she
shooting against?

03:12:43.360 --> 03:12:45.540
-TALIESIN: Everybody.
-MARISHA: It's a spray.

03:12:45.540 --> 03:12:46.870
MATT: It's a cone that big.

03:12:46.870 --> 03:12:48.560
TALIESIN: So it would have
been almost everybody.

03:12:48.560 --> 03:12:50.250
MATT: Just so you guys know,

03:12:50.250 --> 03:12:52.480
cause it's a fun spell
to kind of talk about.

03:12:52.480 --> 03:12:53.330
TALIESIN: It is.

03:12:56.030 --> 03:12:58.220
MATT: And each of you
would have been hit

03:12:58.220 --> 03:12:59.780
with a different
colored ray.

03:12:59.810 --> 03:13:03.180
I would have rolled a d8
to see what color had hit you.

03:13:03.210 --> 03:13:06.330
On a one, you take
10d6 fire damage.

03:13:06.360 --> 03:13:08.000
On a failed save, half.

03:13:08.030 --> 03:13:11.420
An orange, take 10d6 acid
damage, save for half.

03:13:11.450 --> 03:13:14.870
Yellow: 10d6 lightning damage.

03:13:15.000 --> 03:13:16.630
So, just randomly
all of you guys

03:13:16.660 --> 03:13:19.780
basically just take
10d6 of something.

03:13:19.810 --> 03:13:22.480
Green: you take 10d6
poison damage, half save.

03:13:22.510 --> 03:13:24.090
Five, 10d6 cold damage.

03:13:24.120 --> 03:13:26.630
Six, on a failed save,
you're restrained

03:13:26.660 --> 03:13:29.300
and you have to keep making
saves or you turn to stone.

03:13:29.330 --> 03:13:31.330
Seven, you're blinded

03:13:31.360 --> 03:13:33.790
and you have
to keep saving.

03:13:35.220 --> 03:13:37.840
A successful save ends it,
if you fail the next save,

03:13:37.870 --> 03:13:40.360
you will be transported
to another plane.

03:13:40.390 --> 03:13:41.690
LAURA: What?!

03:13:41.690 --> 03:13:43.990
SAM: There's one where you
get to do two things.

03:13:44.000 --> 03:13:45.720
MATT: On an eight, on an eight,

03:13:45.750 --> 03:13:48.090
I roll again for two rays
against that person.

03:13:48.120 --> 03:13:50.180
-LAURA: Oh my God!
-TRAVIS: For two rays?

03:13:50.210 --> 03:13:51.510
SAM: What if you
keep rolling eights?

03:13:51.540 --> 03:13:54.240
MATT: Keep rolling eights,
you're gonna be fucked.

03:13:54.270 --> 03:13:55.240
It's a fun one.

03:13:55.270 --> 03:13:56.480
I like that spell.

03:13:56.510 --> 03:13:57.690
LAURA: Wait, what is a 10?

03:13:57.720 --> 03:13:59.540
Is 10 insta-death,
what is 10?

03:13:59.570 --> 03:14:03.000
MATT: It's one d8, so ten would be
instant death, it would be.

03:14:03.030 --> 03:14:05.210
If I roll a
10 on a d8, sure.

03:14:05.240 --> 03:14:07.210
You are so done.

03:14:07.240 --> 03:14:08.750
TALIESIN: The other
plane of dimension

03:14:08.780 --> 03:14:09.780
is like literally
the Beetlejuice,

03:14:09.810 --> 03:14:11.420
like send you
to the sandworms.

03:14:11.450 --> 03:14:13.240
You're just--

03:14:13.270 --> 03:14:14.450
MATT: Oops.

03:14:14.480 --> 03:14:16.520
TALIESIN: And that's-- you're
out of the fight

03:14:16.520 --> 03:14:18.720
until they can go find
you if anyone's left.

03:14:18.720 --> 03:14:21.210
After everyone else
has taken 10d-- suck.

03:14:21.240 --> 03:14:25.450
MATT: So, guys, we'll pick this up
again next week on Thursday.

03:14:25.480 --> 03:14:27.250
Find out
where Raishan is.

03:14:27.250 --> 03:14:28.570
TRAVIS: Maybe.

03:14:28.570 --> 03:14:31.620
MATT: With two eggs and the corpse
of Thordak, The Cinder King.

03:14:31.620 --> 03:14:33.780
LAURA: Well, hopefully,
oh my God.

03:14:33.810 --> 03:14:35.360
TALIESIN: Red eggs and ham?

03:14:35.390 --> 03:14:37.730
TRAVIS: Yeah, she just escaped
with two Iphone 7's.

03:14:37.730 --> 03:14:39.480
MATT: You start with
a disadvantage.

03:14:39.510 --> 03:14:42.420
TALIESIN: I just want the internet to
do a Dr. Seuss red eggs and--

03:14:42.450 --> 03:14:44.240
I just want her
with like a little

03:14:44.270 --> 03:14:47.420
red steak and two little red--

03:14:47.450 --> 03:14:49.000
That's all I want.

03:14:49.030 --> 03:14:50.260
MATT: Alright, guys.

03:14:50.260 --> 03:14:52.750
You guys, we'll see you
at MAGFest this weekend.

03:14:52.780 --> 03:14:55.240
We'll see you
there shortly.

03:14:55.270 --> 03:14:57.030
SAM: Remember, bring
your magazines

03:14:57.060 --> 03:14:59.330
and have Matt and
Marisha sign any magazine.

03:14:59.330 --> 03:15:00.540
TALIESIN: Highlights.

03:15:00.540 --> 03:15:02.000
MARISHA: Yeah, all magazines.

03:15:02.000 --> 03:15:03.330
We will sign them.

03:15:03.360 --> 03:15:05.650
LIAM: I mean, you're gonna say,
you don't know,

03:15:05.650 --> 03:15:08.470
but if J'Mon had not nurked
those three attacks that round,

03:15:08.470 --> 03:15:10.240
might she have gone down?

03:15:10.240 --> 03:15:11.800
MATT: She came pretty close.

03:15:11.800 --> 03:15:14.630
LAURA: Oh, yeah, if J'Mon had not
gotten three, two, one.

03:15:14.660 --> 03:15:16.060
MATT: Three, two and a one.

03:15:16.090 --> 03:15:17.270
MARISHA: That sucked.

03:15:17.300 --> 03:15:18.870
MATT: That really sucked.

03:15:19.000 --> 03:15:22.270
MARISHA: I was about to lay some serious
damage when she ran away.

03:15:22.300 --> 03:15:25.750
I was gonna bust out a seventh
level blight and then she ran.

03:15:25.780 --> 03:15:29.220
MATT: I wasn't getting-- cause that
the fire breath is nasty.

03:15:29.220 --> 03:15:31.400
MARISHA: Yeah, and he didn't
fucking recharge it.

03:15:31.400 --> 03:15:34.450
TRAVIS: If your highness wasn't smart
enough to break another egg...

03:15:34.450 --> 03:15:36.350
LAURA: I got to attack
one time that round.

03:15:36.350 --> 03:15:38.690
Every other round was
just trying not to die.

03:15:38.720 --> 03:15:41.190
LIAM: He should have stretched
before the fight.

03:15:43.570 --> 03:15:46.160
-MATT: But anyway.
-MARISHA: Happy New Year.

03:15:46.160 --> 03:15:47.560
MATT: Happy New Year!

03:15:47.560 --> 03:15:49.030
Well done, guys,
you survived.

03:15:49.030 --> 03:15:50.690
-MARISHA: Yeah.
-TALIESIN: Yay.

03:15:50.690 --> 03:15:52.330
MATT: Mostly.

03:15:52.360 --> 03:15:57.240
Thank you so much for our
sponsor tonight, nobody.

03:15:57.270 --> 03:15:58.810
2017.

03:15:58.840 --> 03:16:00.300
You guys
are our sponsors.

03:16:00.330 --> 03:16:01.790
Well, every
week you are.

03:16:01.790 --> 03:16:03.990
So thank you for all
your wonderful support.

03:16:03.990 --> 03:16:06.570
Happy New Year, welcome
to the chaos of 2017.

03:16:06.600 --> 03:16:09.270
We're there
alongside you for it.

03:16:09.300 --> 03:16:10.840
We'll see you
guys soon and...

03:16:10.870 --> 03:16:12.720
Is it Thursday yet?

03:16:12.750 --> 03:16:13.810
Have a good night.
