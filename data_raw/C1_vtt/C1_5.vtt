MATT: Hello everyone, welcome to the fifth episode
of Critical Role! Before we start and get into the

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:10.451
videos for our initial intro, let me go over a
couple of things for the evening. First off, we're

00:00:10.451 --> 00:00:14.627
shooting to get to 1,500 subscribers by this
evening, and as soon as we get there, we're giving

00:00:14.627 --> 00:00:20.211
out a promo kit that's worth about $250, which is
awesome. We'll all go ahead and sign it at the end

00:00:20.211 --> 00:00:24.888
of the day and get it out to you as well. Also,
Tabletop Day is coming up this Saturday, and a few

00:00:24.888 --> 00:00:28.258
of us will be showing up during the stream as well
and any of you guys playing your own tabletop

00:00:28.258 --> 00:00:32.070
games at home, or whatever the case may be, if you
go to the website and register, for each person

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.898
that registers, we're giving away a boardgame to
the charity Big Brothers and Big Sisters, so

00:00:35.898 --> 00:00:39.337
that's a really, really cool thing that you guys
should get involved with. That's this Saturday, at

00:00:39.337 --> 00:00:46.807
International Tabletop Day, and also, we received
a present apparently from the audience.

00:00:46.807 --> 00:00:47.702
TRAVIS: A present?

00:00:47.702 --> 00:00:48.718
MATT: That I get to open.

00:00:48.718 --> 00:00:49.932
LIAM: Vat eez zis present?

00:00:49.932 --> 00:00:50.670
[static]

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.613
MATT: I don't know vat zis present eez, but now I
get to open zis.

00:00:52.613 --> 00:00:53.279
ALL: Ooh!

00:00:53.279 --> 00:00:55.230
MATT: This is for all of us, apparently.

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.024
TALIESIN: What kind of sack is that?

00:00:59.024 --> 00:01:04.247
MATT: It is a big-- oh, it is a gigantic sack.

00:01:04.306 --> 00:01:05.209
ORION: Ooh, I love gigantic sacks

00:01:05.209 --> 00:01:06.898
MATT: Oh my god guys, this is, this is amazing!

00:01:06.898 --> 00:01:07.873
LAURA: There's a card on it.

00:01:07.873 --> 00:01:08.722
MATT: All right.

00:01:08.722 --> 00:01:09.652
LAURA: On the other side.

00:01:09.652 --> 00:01:16.782
MATT: There's a card? Oh snap. By the power of
#TeamNoStream, you have the power.

00:01:16.782 --> 00:01:19.363
By Negihama, thank you Negihama.

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:21.026
ALL: Thank you Negihama!

00:01:21.026 --> 00:01:28.263
MATT: That's amazing, as we now have for the
group, a castle Greyskull.

00:01:28.263 --> 00:01:33.376
ALL: Huzzah! Yay!

00:01:33.376 --> 00:01:37.119
MATT: So during the intro break we're going to go
ahead and open this and find a place for it

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:41.872
nearby, 'cause this is now representative of the
keep that the players have waiting for them at

00:01:41.872 --> 00:01:46.439
Emon once they get out of this horrible mess.
Anyway guys, welcome to Critical Role,

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:51.360
let's get into those intros, shall we?

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.886
ASHLEY: Pike grew up in the outskirts of town,
near the Bramblewood. Her ancestors were a family

00:01:55.886 --> 00:02:01.839
of deep gnomes with quite an unfavorable
reputation. Thievery, destruction, and trickery

00:02:01.839 --> 00:02:07.902
left them with the curse of the last name of
Trickfoot. Sarenrae, the goddess of healing and

00:02:07.902 --> 00:02:12.952
redemption, had other plans for Pike's
great-great-grandfather Wilhand, who left his

00:02:12.952 --> 00:02:19.736
family at a young age after a dream-- a dream that
changed the course of the Trickfoot family.

00:02:19.736 --> 00:02:24.840
Wilhand devoted his life to Sarenrae, and pledged
from then on that him and his family would live a

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:32.086
life of service and devotion. As a child, Pike
seemed to have an affinity to heal. Whether it was

00:02:32.086 --> 00:02:38.668
animals, people, or even flowers, she felt she had
a purpose in making things whole that had once

00:02:38.668 --> 00:02:44.646
been broken. She studied and learned the ways to
heal through divine magic. She lived a peaceful

00:02:44.646 --> 00:02:51.274
life, quiet and simple, until one day, Wilhand was
captured and almost killed by a group of goliath

00:02:51.274 --> 00:02:56.945
barbarians. One of the goliaths took a stand
against the murder of the innocent gnome, and he

00:02:56.945 --> 00:03:03.961
himself was beaten, bloodied, and left for dead,
abandoned by his herd. Wilhand went to Pike for

00:03:03.961 --> 00:03:11.138
help. She prayed, and healed this barbarian as
best she could, bringing him back to life. When he

00:03:11.138 --> 00:03:18.874
awoke, she discovered his name was Grog Strongjaw.
After that, they were the best of friends, a

00:03:18.874 --> 00:03:25.110
rather unlikely pair. Little did she know that in
a few years' time, Grog would soon return the

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:34.202
favor and bring her back from the clutches of
death. After being killed in battle, Pike felt

00:03:34.202 --> 00:03:39.972
angry. She wanted to be stronger, so that it would
never happen again. She spent four months at sea,

00:03:39.972 --> 00:03:46.138
training with the men and women aboard a ship
called The Broken Howl. Gripping her holy symbol

00:03:46.138 --> 00:03:54.254
in one hand, and her morningstar in the other,
this time, Pike is ready.

00:03:54.254 --> 00:04:02.300
TRAVIS: Right, listen up! If you have ale, then
you have a friend in Grog Strongjaw. A goliath of

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:10.195
towering height and size, this barbarian has an
appetite for the two great loves in his life:

00:04:10.195 --> 00:04:20.870
combat, women, and ale. Wait. Easily the brains of
the group, Grog is often consulted for his vast

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:29.684
knowledge of shapes, colors, and shiny things.
Also ale. In his early years, armed with his

00:04:29.684 --> 00:04:35.647
two-handed greataxe, Grog often enjoyed proving
his might amongst the ranks of his family's

00:04:35.647 --> 00:04:41.898
wandering herd. But after coming upon an
unsuspecting elderly gnome in the woods, he

00:04:41.898 --> 00:04:49.594
objected to the killing of such an innocent life.
A creature of impulse, Grog felt only pity for

00:04:49.594 --> 00:05:00.261
this terrified little thing. His disobedience cost
him dearly. Beaten bloody and banished by the herd

00:05:00.261 --> 00:05:08.156
leader, his uncle Kevdak, Grog was abandoned and
left to die. Exiled from his herd, it was then

00:05:08.156 --> 00:05:16.088
that the relative of the very gnome he fought to
save, saved him. It was the kindness of a gnome

00:05:16.088 --> 00:05:23.119
cleric named Pike that healed Grog, bringing him
back from death's edge. And they have remained

00:05:23.119 --> 00:05:30.150
close friends ever since. Most nights, Grog can be
found challenging entire taverns to wrestling

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:41.810
matches! Or accompanying Scanlan to the nearest
house where you pay for lady favors. Also ale.

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:45.747
MARISHA: A first impression of Keyleth would leave
you with little information on the half-elven

00:05:45.747 --> 00:05:50.819
druid. You might even think that her social
awkwardness due to her sheltered upbringing is

00:05:50.819 --> 00:05:59.220
kind of sweet. Of course, it would be unwise to
underestimate her based on first impressions.

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:04.318
Under that unintimidating petite frame is a
vicious beast waiting to be unleashed, whose

00:06:04.318 --> 00:06:11.430
natural powers have made even the fiercest of
champions pee their pants. Literally. Born to the

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:16.983
Air tribe of the Ashari people, Keyleth was raised
with a deep love of nature and the elemental

00:06:16.983 --> 00:06:23.298
magics. It is her people's inherent duty to
protect the delicate areas in Tal'Dorei where the

00:06:23.298 --> 00:06:28.892
four elemental planes begin to bleed with this
realm. Since she was a little girl, she had quite

00:06:28.892 --> 00:06:35.008
a knack for air manipulation and beast shaping
abilities. Well, if you consider kittens and

00:06:35.008 --> 00:06:42.036
flying squirrels to be little beasts. Which I do.
Anyways, it wasn't long before the headmaster of

00:06:42.036 --> 00:06:48.336
the tribe, her father, Korren, realized her true
prodigious abilities and she was inveterated to

00:06:48.336 --> 00:06:54.437
succeed him as the next headmaster. Just like
that, her jovial childhood was stripped and

00:06:54.437 --> 00:06:59.512
replaced with endless spell memorization,
teachings from ancient traditions, and exceedingly

00:06:59.512 --> 00:07:05.466
high expectations. Every druid leader-to-be must
embark on a journey to seek out the sister tribes

00:07:05.466 --> 00:07:11.550
in order to introduce and establish respect
amongst the fellow headmasters. They call this the

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:17.714
Aramente, or Noble Odyssey. When her father felt
she was ready, he set her on the path to truly

00:07:17.714 --> 00:07:24.387
discovering herself. Not knowing when, or if, she
will ever return. As she hiked down the mountain

00:07:24.387 --> 00:07:31.008
towards Stillben, she meditated on the task ahead.
Part of the Aramente is proving yourself a strong

00:07:31.008 --> 00:07:37.804
warrior, a valiant protector, and a wise and
compassionate leader. With this knowledge, one

00:07:37.804 --> 00:07:45.960
thought plays in repeat in her mind: is she even
worthy?

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:50.171
TALIESIN: Percy was the third of seven
children, born to a noble family who lived far to

00:07:50.231 --> 00:07:55.230
the north, in the ancient castle of Whitestone.
With so many siblings to share the burdens of

00:07:55.230 --> 00:08:02.405
lordship, Percy turned his attentions to the
sciences, engineering, and naturalism. One day, a

00:08:02.588 --> 00:08:08.237
mysterious couple, named Lord and Lady Briarwood,
came to court. During a feast held in their honor,

00:08:08.237 --> 00:08:13.537
the Briarwoods violently took control of the
castle, killing or imprisoning everyone who would

00:08:13.537 --> 00:08:20.292
stand in their way. Percy awoke chained in the
dungeon, only to be freed by his younger sister.

00:08:20.292 --> 00:08:26.610
Together they fled, chased by the Briarwoods' men.
As they ran, Percy's sister took several arrows to

00:08:26.610 --> 00:08:32.533
the chest and fell. Percy kept running, eventually
jumping into a freezing river and floating

00:08:32.533 --> 00:08:38.533
unconscious to freedom. He did not remember waking
up on a fishing boat. He barely remembered the

00:08:38.533 --> 00:08:45.304
next two years, as he slowly made his way as far
south as possible. Then one night, Percy had a

00:08:45.304 --> 00:08:52.280
dream. A roaring cloud of smoke offered him
vengeance against those who destroyed his family.

00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:59.739
When he awoke, Percy began to design his first
gun. (gunshot)

00:08:59.739 --> 00:09:04.689
SAM: Oh, you haven't heard of Scanlan Shorthalt?
Well, gird your loins, ladies, because he has his

00:09:04.689 --> 00:09:10.867
eye on you. A talented musician, master of
disguise, and dashingly handsome in his own mind,

00:09:10.867 --> 00:09:18.170
Scanlan sings songs almost as much as he sings his
own praises. Born a poor gnome, Scanlan used his

00:09:18.170 --> 00:09:24.148
endless charm and soaring tenor voice to croon for
coin and support his single mother. One day, he

00:09:24.148 --> 00:09:30.624
was discovered by a half-orc promoter, and joined
Dr. Dranzel's Spectacular Traveling Troupe, where

00:09:30.624 --> 00:09:36.857
he learned the ways of the world and honed his
skills as a bard extraordinaire. A loner much of

00:09:36.857 --> 00:09:41.408
his life, Scanlan has never quite come to terms
with the violent death of his mother at the hands

00:09:41.408 --> 00:09:47.239
of a goblin invasion. While his years on the road
provided many, shall we say, educational

00:09:47.239 --> 00:09:53.603
experiences with the opposite sex, deep down
Scanlan yearns for the one thing he's never known:

00:09:53.603 --> 00:10:01.439
the true love of a fellow gnome. Still, Scanlan
considers himself a lover first, performer second,

00:10:01.439 --> 00:10:07.730
and fighter distant third. On the battlefield,
he'll support his allies, but rarely draws blood

00:10:07.730 --> 00:10:14.420
unless it's to protect fellow gnome, Pike. Count
on Scanlan for a hearty laugh, a rollicking song,

00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:21.766
and a twinkle in his eye that melts hearts and
makes the females swoon.

00:10:21.766 --> 00:10:28.319
ORION: Greetings and salutations. I am Tiberius
Stormwind. I hail from a town called Ty'rex,

00:10:28.319 --> 00:10:34.225
located in the heart of Draconia, born from a
politically respected family. At the age of 15, I

00:10:34.225 --> 00:10:39.532
succeeded in passing the Sorcerer's Rite, showing
prodigy-like control of my magic. The judges and

00:10:39.532 --> 00:10:44.237
the Draconian High Council were amazed at how
powerful my spells were for how long I had been

00:10:44.237 --> 00:10:48.763
training. At 20 years old, I was the youngest
appointed member of the Magic Guild in Draconian

00:10:48.763 --> 00:10:55.107
history. For the next few years, I almost went mad
from the malaise of being a guild member, as it's

00:10:55.107 --> 00:11:01.441
rather boring. However, one day I happened upon a
chamber, unused for quite some time. In the room

00:11:01.441 --> 00:11:06.669
were stacks of books and maps of the surrounding
cities and areas around the known world. For

00:11:06.669 --> 00:11:11.883
months I would frequent the chamber, and learned
of artifacts from legend. After a long period of

00:11:11.883 --> 00:11:16.406
research, I made a list of artifacts that caught
my eye. I brought these findings to the High

00:11:16.406 --> 00:11:21.049
Council and was told that all of the information
in the chamber I had stumbled upon was either

00:11:21.049 --> 00:11:26.908
believed to be fiction, or unsolvable mysteries,
and hence were lost forever. I found those answers

00:11:26.908 --> 00:11:32.762
to be unacceptable. A year later, I devised a ruse
and managed to convince the city council to lend

00:11:32.762 --> 00:11:37.888
support in me leaving Draconia on a mission of
peace and diplomacy for the surrounding kingdoms,

00:11:37.888 --> 00:11:42.894
going from town to town and making friends and
allies, in and for the name of Draconia. Being a

00:11:42.894 --> 00:11:48.973
red dragonborn, I had quite the task on my hands
in that respect, but it was exactly what I needed

00:11:48.973 --> 00:11:55.039
so I could explore the world and find these
artifacts, as I felt the truth was out there. Some

00:11:55.039 --> 00:12:00.658
may describe me as buffoonish, but I say poppycock
to all that. I am much sharper than most give me

00:12:00.658 --> 00:12:06.294
credit for. I just don't pay attention to things
sometimes. I've also been known to be rather

00:12:06.294 --> 00:12:13.926
cunning, loyal, happy-go-lucky, and well,
dangerous. I can't help but show my true scales

00:12:13.926 --> 00:12:20.296
every now and then. But overall, I think I'm quite
friendly for a dragonborn.

00:12:20.296 --> 00:12:25.175
LIAM: Never entirely welcome in the company of
elves or men, Vax'ildan learned at a young age to

00:12:25.175 --> 00:12:31.663
skip past formality, preferring instead to invite
himself in your door. Along with twin sister

00:12:31.663 --> 00:12:38.828
Vex'ahlia, Vax was born by a chance encounter
between elven royalty and human peasantry. Raised

00:12:38.828 --> 00:12:43.218
by their mother in their early years, the twins
were eventually sent off to their father in the

00:12:43.218 --> 00:12:49.226
elven capital of Syngorn, but their cool reception
among the elves there never warmed, and their time

00:12:49.226 --> 00:12:54.850
in the capital didn't last. The siblings stole
away one autumn night and set out on the open

00:12:54.850 --> 00:13:01.097
road. After a few years of wandering, they
eventually decided to return to their mother, and

00:13:01.097 --> 00:13:06.683
journeyed back to the lands of their youth. But
instead of finding their childhood home, they

00:13:06.683 --> 00:13:13.608
returned to a pile of rubble. Their mother was
gone, their home burned to ash. Pressing the

00:13:13.608 --> 00:13:22.656
townspeople for answers, they learned of the day
the dragon came. With their ties all severed,

00:13:22.847 --> 00:13:29.612
Vax'ildan and his sister set out to find their
fortune together in Tal'Dorei. An outsider since

00:13:29.612 --> 00:13:36.196
birth, Vax quickly learned to solve life's
challenges in his own particular way, often by

00:13:36.196 --> 00:13:44.383
sidestepping them entirely. And when his knack for
circumventing adversity isn't enough, the way of

00:13:44.383 --> 00:13:49.513
blades the elves schooled him in more than makes
up the difference.

00:13:49.513 --> 00:13:54.201
LAURA: Like so many half-elves, Vex'ahlia has
spent most of her life suffering the cool

00:13:54.201 --> 00:14:01.653
reception of a people who don't fully accept her.
Born of a human mother and an elven father who

00:14:01.653 --> 00:14:06.765
only later in life took an interest in their
existence, Vex'ahlia and her twin brother

00:14:06.765 --> 00:14:15.017
Vax'ildan quickly realized the only people they
could truly rely on in this world were each other.

00:14:15.017 --> 00:14:20.189
It was at the age of ten when the two were taken
from their mother, and brought to live in Syngorn,

00:14:20.189 --> 00:14:26.450
the isolated elven city for which their father was
an ambassador. He quietly took them in, but always

00:14:26.450 --> 00:14:33.264
kept an icy distance, and after too many years of
disdainful looks, the pair decided to leave his

00:14:33.264 --> 00:14:41.325
indifference behind, and set out on their own. Vax
took to the cities, stealing small trinkets and

00:14:41.325 --> 00:14:49.150
learning the ways of the thief, while Vex kept to
the woods. She preferred the isolation. Always the

00:14:49.150 --> 00:14:56.339
keen observer, she learned to hunt and to track,
to spy and to shoot. And through a series of

00:14:56.339 --> 00:15:04.112
fateful events, earned herself a companion in the
form of a bear, her own stolen Trinket, to fight

00:15:04.112 --> 00:15:13.565
alongside her and protect her fiercely. Also, he
is adorable and gives expert massages.

00:15:13.965 --> 00:15:18.586
MATT: Welcome back, guys. So we finally have
Pike's video finished, so I hope you got to enjoy

00:15:18.586 --> 00:15:25.720
that. As a heads-up, too, unfortunately we're
going to be down one Scanlan due to work, but

00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:29.521
that's okay, the bard will be in our hearts this
evening, and you're welcome to tweet at him

00:15:29.521 --> 00:15:31.620
angrily to make sure he makes the next session.

00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:32.783
LAURA: Yeah.

00:15:32.783 --> 00:15:39.400
MATT: So, without further ado, let's go and kick
into the recap. So, the party has initially been

00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:46.347
sent down on a mission by the arcanist Allura
Vysoren in search of a halfling paladin who has

00:15:46.347 --> 00:15:51.530
gone missing, named Lady Kima of Vord. A folk hero
and a very respected individual, she went on a

00:15:51.530 --> 00:15:56.708
vision quest and apparently went alone into
Kraghammer seeking some sort of great evil that

00:15:56.708 --> 00:16:02.157
was festering beneath the city, and hasn't been
seen for weeks and weeks. The party was hired by

00:16:02.157 --> 00:16:06.727
her to go and try to find her whereabouts and
hopefully bring her back safely. Since traversing

00:16:06.727 --> 00:16:13.601
and meeting individuals in Kraghammer, they then
spearheaded into the Greyspine Mines where

00:16:13.601 --> 00:16:18.595
apparently these monstrosities have been burbling
out time and time again over the past few weeks.

00:16:18.595 --> 00:16:22.466
Pushing down, they had encountered umber hulks,
they managed to inquire some duergar, which,

00:16:22.466 --> 00:16:28.263
apparently there's a lot of them down here.
Duergar being an ashy-skinned, subterranean dark,

00:16:28.263 --> 00:16:36.971
evil dwarf-type offshoot. One of which had with it
a brain-type quadruped that managed to Brain Spike

00:16:36.971 --> 00:16:42.262
Grog and send him catatonic for a short time.
They, wandering through the caverns, discovered

00:16:42.262 --> 00:16:48.178
there was a duergar war camp across the way from--
across this large chasm that was currently being

00:16:48.178 --> 00:16:52.159
run by a general duergar alongside what appeared
to be, and what they've now discovered to be, a

00:16:52.159 --> 00:16:57.454
mind flayer or an illithid. They managed to, upon
looking deeper into this cavern, finding hidden

00:16:57.454 --> 00:17:02.589
behind a waterfall, thanks to the druid and the
ranger, completely stealing from the rest of the

00:17:02.589 --> 00:17:08.835
group their flying carpet, made a very tenuous
relationship and alignment with another mind

00:17:08.835 --> 00:17:14.781
flayer, apparently cast out of his own society,
searching to find a way to both get revenge and

00:17:14.781 --> 00:17:20.871
find his way back into his colony of people. And
his name was Clarota, lovingly called Clarence by

00:17:20.947 --> 00:17:26.255
the group, probably much to his own chagrin. After
which they decided to go ahead and try to extract

00:17:26.255 --> 00:17:33.185
information from this duergar general, and stop
this war camp from preparing itself for battle and

00:17:33.185 --> 00:17:39.567
attack, seemingly, on Kraghammer in the near
future. Through a strange, crazy plan

00:17:39.567 --> 00:17:44.372
they came up with, they managed to fly undetected
over via flying carpet and eagle, and floating

00:17:44.434 --> 00:17:49.544
sorcerer, over the entire war camp, made a Metal
Gear run into the center of their main barracks--

00:17:49.544 --> 00:17:50.947
(all laugh)

00:17:50.947 --> 00:17:55.843
MATT: -- threw a bucket of goblin shit into the
face of the one mind flayer--

00:17:55.843 --> 00:17:56.857
ASHLEY: Whoops.

00:17:56.857 --> 00:18:02.150
MATT: -- after which, Vax bisected it, pretty
much, in one surprise round of attacks that led to

00:18:02.150 --> 00:18:08.607
a large battle in the center of this building,
partway through which ground began to rumble. And

00:18:08.607 --> 00:18:13.132
then digging a forth from underneath, a bulette, a
gargantuan armored, burrowing creature that was

00:18:13.132 --> 00:18:18.084
hungry and very dangerous that then made the
battle that much more intense. A heavy,

00:18:18.084 --> 00:18:23.213
blood-filled battle later, involved with Percy
getting his hand caught and firing his gun into the gullet

00:18:23.213 --> 00:18:29.320
of the beast, eventually it had its armor pulled
apart and was defeated by the party. The remnants

00:18:29.382 --> 00:18:33.407
of the duergar army inside of this building have
been destroyed, aside from a few stragglers who

00:18:33.407 --> 00:18:37.731
have laid their weapons down, and the general now
lies beaten, on his knees before the rest of the

00:18:37.731 --> 00:18:43.201
party. And that is where we pick up and begin. So,
as you all are catching your breath, breathing

00:18:43.201 --> 00:18:47.677
heavily, as the adrenaline slowly leaves the
system. Looking around this building, with the

00:18:47.677 --> 00:18:50.964
large hole still glaring through the roof.

00:18:50.964 --> 00:18:53.967
ORION: I'm waving through it.

00:18:53.967 --> 00:18:54.966
MATT: Tiberius is waving through it.

00:18:54.966 --> 00:18:56.124
LAURA: Oh, you're still up top.

00:18:56.124 --> 00:19:02.076
MATT: The general's on the ground, warhammer at
his side, blackened armor still kind of sizzling

00:19:02.076 --> 00:19:08.084
with the arcane energy from his temporary
Banishment via Scanlan. He sits there with this

00:19:08.084 --> 00:19:13.055
kind of gnarled, brackish beard, looking about the
rest of you with these wild kind of white-coated

00:19:13.055 --> 00:19:24.312
eyes. "So you found your way in. What's your
purpose? What do you want from me?"

00:19:24.312 --> 00:19:28.344
LIAM: Well, Vax walks right up to him and walks
behind him and grabs him by the hair, and right

00:19:28.344 --> 00:19:32.370
back to this position. Let's have a talk.

00:19:32.370 --> 00:19:33.456
LAURA: Oh.

00:19:33.456 --> 00:19:34.965
LIAM: Would you care to have a chat?

00:19:34.965 --> 00:19:36.272
LAURA: Of course I would, thank you.

00:19:36.272 --> 00:19:39.244
MATT: "If you want blood, take it. It's all you're
getting from me."

00:19:39.244 --> 00:19:40.303
TRAVIS: Okay, kill him.

00:19:40.303 --> 00:19:41.678
ALL: No, wait!

00:19:41.678 --> 00:19:43.027
ORION: Hold on a second, ask the question.

00:19:43.027 --> 00:19:44.289
LAURA: We don't want your blood.

00:19:44.289 --> 00:19:45.444
ORION: What are we asking?

00:19:45.444 --> 00:19:49.110
LAURA: We're looking for a halfling. Have you seen
one?

00:19:49.110 --> 00:19:50.690
MATT: "I don't know what you're talking about."

00:19:50.690 --> 00:19:53.392
LAURA: A female halfling. She came down here.

00:19:53.392 --> 00:19:57.162
MATT: "Well, she wouldn't have gotten far if she
did. Not with my people."

00:19:57.162 --> 00:20:03.212
LIAM: I take my dagger and stick it in about a
centimeter and say, your master is gone, it's just

00:20:03.212 --> 00:20:11.334
you and your friends here now, I think it's in
your best interest to talk. You could walk away

00:20:11.334 --> 00:20:15.667
from here. You don't have to die if you can play
nicely.

00:20:15.667 --> 00:20:19.432
ORION: And believe me when I tell you he usually
kills everybody.

00:20:19.432 --> 00:20:21.333
He doesn't give that offer very often.

00:20:21.333 --> 00:20:23.712
(all laugh)

00:20:23.712 --> 00:20:27.072
MATT: Go ahead and make an intimidation roll with
advantage.

00:20:27.072 --> 00:20:28.480
TRAVIS: First roll of the night. First roll of the
night.

00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:29.049
ORION: Yeah!

00:20:29.049 --> 00:20:30.025
LIAM: Natural 20!

00:20:30.025 --> 00:20:32.078
(all laugh and cheer)

00:20:32.078 --> 00:20:33.606
MATT: That's a way to start.

00:20:33.606 --> 00:20:35.144
MARISHA: The first one tonight!

00:20:35.144 --> 00:20:36.471
LAURA: That's the way!

00:20:36.471 --> 00:20:38.238
TRAVIS: Probably those eight miles you rode.

00:20:38.238 --> 00:20:39.272
ORION: Shush!

00:20:39.272 --> 00:20:45.151
MATT: As you pull the blade to his throat, he
chuckles deeply against the strain. "Your halfling

00:20:45.151 --> 00:20:54.736
"lass was foolish. We took her. We delivered her to
King Murghol as a present. If she lives, she's

00:20:54.736 --> 00:21:00.852
"probably ruined and broken deep within the
dungeons of Emberhold.

00:21:00.852 --> 00:21:02.941
"You're welcome to go for her there."

00:21:02.941 --> 00:21:04.613
LIAM: Who's this king of yours?

00:21:04.613 --> 00:21:05.702
LAURA: King what?

00:21:05.702 --> 00:21:06.747
MARISHA: Murgholt?

00:21:06.747 --> 00:21:07.976
MATT: "Murghol."

00:21:11.666 --> 00:21:15.539
ORION: Which way should we head?

00:21:15.616 --> 00:21:17.170
MATT: "Ooh, down, probably."

00:21:17.170 --> 00:21:20.916
ORION: I mean, is there any particular shortcuts
or less running into

00:21:20.916 --> 00:21:23.640
your kind along the way, I suppose?

00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:26.912
MATT: "I highly doubt it." He spits in your
direction.

00:21:26.912 --> 00:21:32.534
ORION: Oh! Prestidigitation. And I catch it and
throw it back into his face.

00:21:32.534 --> 00:21:35.177
MARISHA: Can I do an insight check to see if he's
lying about that?

00:21:35.177 --> 00:21:37.227
MATT: Go for it.

00:21:37.227 --> 00:21:39.466
TALIESIN: I think we have some prisoners to free
or something as well.

00:21:39.466 --> 00:21:42.741
LAURA: Yes.

00:21:42.741 --> 00:21:44.665
MARISHA: 22.

00:21:44.665 --> 00:21:55.398
MATT: He does not appear to be lying about his
interpretation of her, apparently she is where he

00:21:55.398 --> 00:21:59.078
is. As to where her current state is, you don't
know, but he seems to have a very, very made-up

00:21:59.078 --> 00:22:02.797
mind as to her possibility of her being alive
still.

00:22:02.797 --> 00:22:08.676
MARISHA: What about a secret path that we can
maybe get through to avoid some of these people?

00:22:08.676 --> 00:22:10.779
Was kind of wondering if he's lying.

00:22:10.779 --> 00:22:13.776
MATT: You can press him that information even
harder.

00:22:13.776 --> 00:22:18.156
MARISHA: Hey guys, we should press him for
information about this passage.

00:22:18.156 --> 00:22:19.940
LIAM: Just a couple of more questions.

00:22:19.940 --> 00:22:22.773
LAURA: Can I start speaking to him in Underdark?

00:22:22.773 --> 00:22:23.714
MATT: Of course.

00:22:23.714 --> 00:22:24.736
LAURA: And I ask him--

00:22:24.736 --> 00:22:25.658
MARISHA: That's hot.

00:22:25.658 --> 00:22:31.862
LAURA: Yep, it's an awesome language. Tell me
about the hidden passages. I know there are some.

00:22:31.862 --> 00:22:33.118
I am good tonight, you guys

00:22:33.118 --> 00:22:34.229
TRAVIS: What does Underdark sound like, by the
way?

00:22:34.229 --> 00:22:35.398
(all laugh)

00:22:35.398 --> 00:22:36.482
LAURA: It sounds kind of like--

00:22:36.482 --> 00:22:37.277
TALIESIN: Parseltongue?

00:22:37.277 --> 00:22:38.089
LIAM: It's like Pig Latin.

00:22:38.089 --> 00:22:39.664
LAURA: (speaking Undercommon)

00:22:39.664 --> 00:22:40.920
TRAVIS: Mm, no!

00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:44.200
LIAM: Ere-way are the idden-hay assages-pay?

00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:48.096
MATT: It's kind of reminiscent of Black Speech
from the Tolkien universe, that has that guttural

00:22:48.096 --> 00:22:51.231
(speaking Black Speech) very, very deep.

00:22:51.231 --> 00:22:52.294
LAURA: Oh right, that.

00:22:52.294 --> 00:22:53.588
ALL: (speaking Black Speech)

00:22:53.588 --> 00:22:56.630
MATT: A little bit like a whispering darkness to
it. As she speaks this tongue, it catches a lot of

00:22:56.630 --> 00:22:59.531
you off guard, you've not heard her use this
tongue until this point.

00:22:59.531 --> 00:23:01.608
Make an intimidation check.

00:23:01.608 --> 00:23:05.981
ASHLEY: (gasps) Vex, what are you doing? What is
this coming out of your mouth?

00:23:05.981 --> 00:23:09.054
TRAVIS: That sounds real pretty.

00:23:09.054 --> 00:23:10.273
LAURA: Right, I have my papers.

00:23:10.273 --> 00:23:11.228
MATT: Get your sheet ready.

00:23:11.228 --> 00:23:12.756
LAURA: Oh noes, hold on, hold on.

00:23:12.756 --> 00:23:14.049
MATT: You got your paper today? Lovely.

00:23:14.049 --> 00:23:15.113
LIAM: She's bonafide.

00:23:15.113 --> 00:23:16.393
LAURA: 18.

00:23:16.393 --> 00:23:28.479
MATT: 18. He says, "No passages to the stronghold,
but there is a way in. Aside from the front. Good

00:23:28.479 --> 00:23:31.606
"luck getting up in there from that point."

00:23:31.606 --> 00:23:36.025
ASHLEY: Is it through the lake?

00:23:36.025 --> 00:23:42.734
MATT: "Yes, through the lake. Deep below, you'll
find a tunnel. This tunnel will lead you to a

00:23:42.734 --> 00:23:46.222
"subterranean passage straight to the stronghold."

00:23:46.222 --> 00:23:48.100
LAURA: Can we check to make sure he's not
untruthful?

00:23:48.100 --> 00:23:49.150
MATT: Make an insight.

00:23:49.150 --> 00:23:56.416
LAURA: (groans) Okay. 16?

00:23:56.416 --> 00:23:58.063
MATT: No, he's bullshitting through his teeth.

00:23:58.063 --> 00:23:59.690
LAURA: Oh, okay.

00:23:59.690 --> 00:24:00.983
LIAM: Vex'ahlia?

00:24:00.983 --> 00:24:04.771
MATT: Hey, he seemed honest about the passage but
dishonest about the-- he's basically following her

00:24:04.771 --> 00:24:06.590
lead. "Uh-huh."

00:24:06.590 --> 00:24:07.917
LAURA: You're lying.

00:24:07.917 --> 00:24:09.528
MATT: "Perhaps."

00:24:09.528 --> 00:24:12.194
LAURA: Tell us true, where is it?

00:24:12.194 --> 00:24:17.178
MATT: "If I tell you, will you let me live?"

00:24:17.178 --> 00:24:18.694
TRAVIS: Ooh. Well.

00:24:18.694 --> 00:24:20.219
TALIESIN: I think that's very reasonable.

00:24:20.219 --> 00:24:21.489
LAURA: I think that's reasonable. We'll--

00:24:21.489 --> 00:24:22.646
MATT: "I'm essentially--"

00:24:22.646 --> 00:24:24.004
TALIESIN: We will not kill you.

00:24:24.004 --> 00:24:24.951
LAURA: I think we can--

00:24:24.951 --> 00:24:26.420
TRAVIS: We can lock him up. And then kill him.

00:24:26.420 --> 00:24:27.606
LIAM: We'll leave you alive.

00:24:27.606 --> 00:24:29.029
LAURA: We'll leave you alive.

00:24:29.029 --> 00:24:29.975
LIAM: Yes.

00:24:29.975 --> 00:24:32.657
MATT: "Don't just leave me alive. Give me a chance
to walk from this building,

00:24:32.657 --> 00:24:34.292
"on my own, arms intact."

00:24:34.292 --> 00:24:35.274
TRAVIS: No.

00:24:35.274 --> 00:24:40.271
MATT: "And I'll give you the secret entrance to
Emberhold itself,

00:24:40.271 --> 00:24:42.489
"leading you straight within the throne room."

00:24:42.489 --> 00:24:44.106
ORION: Well, that's a good thing.

00:24:44.106 --> 00:24:47.795
TALIESIN: So we have to leave you alive, and let
you leave this building intact?

00:24:47.795 --> 00:24:49.605
MATT: "Correct."

00:24:49.605 --> 00:24:56.059
TRAVIS: I go over and pick up his warhammer and
say, you may-- maybe-- leave.

00:24:56.059 --> 00:24:58.946
But I get to keep this as a souvenir.

00:24:58.946 --> 00:25:03.303
TALIESIN: I actually think this is an appropriate
moment to play with a bit of banditry. I say we

00:25:03.303 --> 00:25:07.035
take everything from him and he can make his way
out all on his own.

00:25:07.035 --> 00:25:07.911
TRAVIS: I like that idea.

00:25:07.911 --> 00:25:08.721
LAURA: Yeah--

00:25:08.721 --> 00:25:09.571
MARISHA: Ooh, that's fun.

00:25:09.571 --> 00:25:10.406
LAURA: -- all his clothes, everything.

00:25:10.406 --> 00:25:11.398
TRAVIS: Butt naked.

00:25:11.398 --> 00:25:12.499
LIAM: And you can advise--

00:25:12.499 --> 00:25:13.485
MARISHA: Wait, wait, hang on.

00:25:13.485 --> 00:25:14.733
ORION: As is his undergarments on for--

00:25:14.733 --> 00:25:15.857
TRAVIS: Why?

00:25:15.857 --> 00:25:16.962
ORION: I don't care to see that.

00:25:16.962 --> 00:25:20.142
MARISHA: Why don't we take him with us? Just in
casies--

00:25:20.142 --> 00:25:27.121
MATT: At which point, a cold, clammy hand touches
your shoulder and pulls you aside as--

00:25:27.202 --> 00:25:27.867
MARISHA: Ew.

00:25:27.867 --> 00:25:34.515
MATT: -- a partially hooded Clarota steps forward
and says, "I'll attempt to read his surface

00:25:34.515 --> 00:25:40.552
"thoughts. If he tries to keep it from me, I'll
know."

00:25:40.552 --> 00:25:43.502
TRAVIS: Smart, smart!

00:25:43.502 --> 00:25:50.238
MATT: As he steps forward, he puts one hand in front of him
and his eyes gleam with a sickly green hue. You

00:25:50.314 --> 00:25:58.194
can see the general tips his head back for a
second and begins twitching an eye. Sweat begins

00:25:58.194 --> 00:26:03.933
to bead around his brow as Clarota takes another
step forward, tensing his hand once more, his head

00:26:04.009 --> 00:26:09.577
beginning to bow forward with an intensity, a
force of focus towards his direction. You can now

00:26:09.577 --> 00:26:17.632
see the general, "Let me live. Let me go and I'll
tell you. This isn't necessary. I'm willing to

00:26:17.632 --> 00:26:19.848
"give you the information." You can see a trickle
of blood

00:26:19.848 --> 00:26:21.651
begin to pour out of one of his nostrils.

00:26:21.651 --> 00:26:22.805
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:26:22.805 --> 00:26:24.594
ORION: That's a mind flayer.

00:26:24.594 --> 00:26:27.251
LAURA: What do we do? I think we should stop him.
Should we stop him?

00:26:27.251 --> 00:26:28.531
LIAM: Clarota.

00:26:28.531 --> 00:26:29.367
LAURA: Wait.

00:26:29.367 --> 00:26:35.604
LIAM: Does he know anything about K'varn?

00:26:35.604 --> 00:26:41.206
MATT: "Let me see." And the mind flayer pushes
once more into his brain. You see a twitch to his

00:26:41.206 --> 00:26:45.433
face as his head kind of lolls back and rolls for
a second, resisting as best he can. But his will

00:26:45.509 --> 00:26:50.278
is currently being beaten by the defeat of the
battle, the lack of his compatriot mind flayer,

00:26:50.278 --> 00:26:56.548
and the sheer intensity of Clarota now focused on
vengeance and returning to his people. The blood

00:26:56.548 --> 00:27:00.362
beings to stream not just from his nostrils, but
from his ears as well. As Clarota releases him for

00:27:00.362 --> 00:27:11.458
a second, he goes, "He has not seen K'varn, but
knows a bit of his nature. I cannot read it, but

00:27:11.647 --> 00:27:17.525
we could press for more information."

00:27:17.525 --> 00:27:18.478
LIAM: I walk up--

00:27:18.478 --> 00:27:19.909
LAURA: I think we should just ask him.

00:27:19.909 --> 00:27:25.637
LIAM: -- next to Clarota, push the dwarf against
the wall, and say, our friend here is not as

00:27:25.637 --> 00:27:35.693
patient as I am. We want to know about this
K'varn, and we want you and all your men, all your

00:27:35.693 --> 00:27:42.588
little mates here, to throw your weapons into the
chasm, you can go fuck off, but we want to know

00:27:42.588 --> 00:27:47.891
everything. And this is your last chance. Right
now, right here. Talk.

00:27:47.891 --> 00:27:49.271
TRAVIS: And you have to get naked.

00:27:49.271 --> 00:27:50.613
LAURA: (whispers) And you have to get naked.

00:27:50.613 --> 00:27:51.766
LIAM: That's correct.

00:27:51.766 --> 00:27:52.832
ORION: Will you stop with the naked? Grog--

00:27:52.832 --> 00:27:53.823
TRAVIS: What?

00:27:53.823 --> 00:27:54.943
TALIESIN: I'm with you on that.

00:27:54.943 --> 00:27:55.908
TRAVIS: Thank you.

00:27:55.908 --> 00:27:56.921
ASHLEY: Yeah, me too.

00:27:56.921 --> 00:27:59.782
MARISHA: It's starting to become a thing now. I'm
just saying.

00:27:59.782 --> 00:28:09.191
MATT: "K'varn was responsible for forging the
alliance. For centuries and generations, his

00:28:09.191 --> 00:28:19.675
"people and mine killed and fought. It wasn't until
K'varn came that we decided to work together for a

00:28:19.675 --> 00:28:31.066
"common cause. Expansion, unification, dominion
over this land and these mountains. Divided, we

00:28:31.066 --> 00:28:43.007
"were weak, petty, greedy. With K'varn leading us,
we have purpose, we have growth. We could take

00:28:43.007 --> 00:28:48.781
"what we'd like, and I'm but one dwarf. If I fall
over here,

00:28:48.781 --> 00:28:52.831
"many more will take over where I fell."

00:28:52.831 --> 00:28:58.957
TALIESIN: Well, we can see that's obviously worked
out really well for you. I think that I'm

00:28:58.957 --> 00:29:01.034
satisfied, are you satisfied?

00:29:01.034 --> 00:29:02.469
LAURA: What kind of creature is K'varn?

00:29:02.469 --> 00:29:04.012
LIAM: What is K'varn?

00:29:04.012 --> 00:29:06.334
MATT: "I have not seen K'varn personally."

00:29:06.334 --> 00:29:08.530
LAURA: But you've heard rumors, though?

00:29:08.530 --> 00:29:14.935
MATT: "What I know of K'varn-- a being of immense
intelligence. A creature that needs not walk this

00:29:14.935 --> 00:29:24.139
"earth, one that does not touch the land that it
traverses. I know it sees all, it smiles from a

00:29:24.139 --> 00:29:33.668
"toothy maw and laughs, laughs in the darkness.
Protruding from its forehead, one nasty, gnarled

00:29:33.749 --> 00:29:44.684
"black horn, terrible source of its dark power.
That is what's beneath here."

00:29:44.953 --> 00:29:46.205
LAURA: Is he telling the truth?

00:29:46.205 --> 00:29:47.352
MATT: Insight check.

00:29:47.352 --> 00:29:48.960
LIAM: Insight check for me as well.

00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:54.104
TALIESIN: Would I recognize this creature he's
describing?

00:29:54.104 --> 00:29:59.422
MATT: Go ahead and make a nature check. Or arcana,
either one.

00:29:59.422 --> 00:30:00.717
MARISHA: Can I assist him?

00:30:00.717 --> 00:30:01.870
TALIESIN: Or arcana? 14.

00:30:01.870 --> 00:30:03.238
MARISHA: Can I do a nature check?

00:30:03.238 --> 00:30:04.968
MATT: This'll be more for your own personal
knowledge, probably not.

00:30:04.968 --> 00:30:05.928
But you can make one yourself.

00:30:05.928 --> 00:30:07.266
MARISHA: Well, that's what I'm saying.

00:30:07.266 --> 00:30:09.186
TALIESIN: 14.

00:30:09.186 --> 00:30:10.398
MARISHA: 'Cause you're doing arcana?

00:30:10.398 --> 00:30:11.350
TALIESIN: I did arcana.

00:30:11.350 --> 00:30:12.684
ORION: A d20 roll.

00:30:12.684 --> 00:30:17.872
MARISHA: I'm doing nature. 29, nature.

00:30:17.872 --> 00:30:26.797
MATT: All right, so. No natural creature you've
ever heard has this type of essence to it,

00:30:26.797 --> 00:30:29.299
having a single black horn.

00:30:29.299 --> 00:30:31.431
LIAM: It's clearly a narwhal.

00:30:31.431 --> 00:30:32.303
MATT: It is.

00:30:32.303 --> 00:30:33.423
LIAM: It's a sentient narwhal.

00:30:33.423 --> 00:30:35.564
MATT: It's an awful, awful narwhal. Way to spoil
the story, Liam.

00:30:35.564 --> 00:30:37.053
MARISHA: Demon narwhal.

00:30:37.053 --> 00:30:39.481
ASHLEY: (singsong) Well, maybe we should go.

00:30:39.481 --> 00:30:46.941
MATT: Gnashing teeth, black horn, very
intelligent. That doesn't seem to be anything from

00:30:46.941 --> 00:30:52.304
nature itself. From your experience, there are
different entities, but usually there are multiple

00:30:52.304 --> 00:30:57.586
horns. Singular, demonic beings that would have
extreme intelligence, sharp teeth, horns, and

00:30:57.586 --> 00:31:01.942
you've had brief brushes in the past with demonic
entities that seems to run in a similar vein, but

00:31:01.942 --> 00:31:08.861
nothing in particular is creeping into mind. It's
going to be difficult for you to specifically come

00:31:08.861 --> 00:31:16.597
up with this, with what little information you
currently have. Yeah.

00:31:16.597 --> 00:31:18.930
ORION: Well, I'm satisfied.

00:31:18.930 --> 00:31:19.928
LIAM: I am, too.

00:31:19.928 --> 00:31:21.115
LAURA: Maybe we should let him go.

00:31:21.115 --> 00:31:21.969
LIAM: Why don't you strip?

00:31:21.969 --> 00:31:22.759
ORION: I agree.

00:31:22.759 --> 00:31:23.631
TRAVIS: Do you wanna handcuff him?

00:31:23.631 --> 00:31:24.601
ASHLEY: Take off your clothes!

00:31:24.601 --> 00:31:26.671
LAURA: Yeah, let's take his-- We take Grog's
handcuffs out of his bag.

00:31:26.671 --> 00:31:29.523
MATT: "Let me-- That was not the deal! You leave
me, unspoiled, on my life,

00:31:29.523 --> 00:31:31.934
"and I tell you the way into Emberhold."

00:31:31.934 --> 00:31:33.006
LAURA: Well, tell us!

00:31:33.006 --> 00:31:35.301
ORION: Take the hammer. That's rough on him. Leave
his armor on.

00:31:35.301 --> 00:31:37.352
LAURA: You haven't told us yet, have you?

00:31:37.352 --> 00:31:41.138
LIAM: We already told you your weapons are ours.

00:31:41.138 --> 00:31:44.795
TALIESIN: In fact, we'll be keeping your weapons,
your armor, and I believe, your pride.

00:31:44.795 --> 00:31:46.114
MARISHA: Yes.

00:31:46.114 --> 00:31:49.758
LAURA: But your life is yours.

00:31:49.758 --> 00:31:53.436
TALIESIN: You may even outrun the dwarves we're
about to set free.

00:31:53.436 --> 00:31:55.400
ORION and TRAVIS: Oh good, yeah.

00:31:55.400 --> 00:31:58.165
TRAVIS: Nice! Percy's fucked-up tonight, I like
it.

00:31:58.165 --> 00:31:59.593
TALIESIN: I'm in a mood.

00:31:59.593 --> 00:32:00.665
MATT: "Emberhold."

00:32:00.665 --> 00:32:02.096
LIAM: He tried to make a book out of someone's
flesh once.

00:32:02.096 --> 00:32:03.433
LAURA: Wait, wait. He's telling us, shut up.

00:32:03.433 --> 00:32:04.330
LIAM: Yes, sorry.

00:32:04.330 --> 00:32:08.542
MATT: "Emberhold is the fortress of our people,
built to resist assault from all sides."

00:32:08.542 --> 00:32:09.513
LIAM: Shite.

00:32:09.513 --> 00:32:16.921
MATT: "We've an army, hiding about the outskirts
of it. Kind of like an army you might have in one

00:32:16.921 --> 00:32:25.987
"of yours, if you think you have a chance. However,
since I don't think that's what you carry, your

00:32:26.050 --> 00:32:33.695
"best bet is on the left side of the fortress.
There are two streams of molten rock that pour

00:32:33.695 --> 00:32:41.484
"down the side. The smaller of those two streams
covers a secret tunnel."

00:32:41.484 --> 00:32:46.925
LIAM: Insight check. Is he full of shit? I
rolled-- Oh, nothing too hot at all. Never mind,

00:32:46.925 --> 00:32:49.359
forget it. Forget I said anything.

00:32:49.359 --> 00:32:56.132
MATT: All right. He seems to be forthright and
honest with his information. "However, that'll

00:32:56.132 --> 00:33:01.250
"take you through the lava. That's up to you. It's
meant to open from the inside. A trapdoor-like

00:33:01.250 --> 00:33:08.306
"mechanism that spreads the actual flow. From the
outside, well, good luck.

00:33:08.306 --> 00:33:15.245
"I've done my side of the bargain. Let me free."

00:33:15.245 --> 00:33:17.996
LIAM: Stepping behind, I take my knife, and I cut
his belt loose and let his pants fall,

00:33:17.996 --> 00:33:21.140
and I give him a little nudge.

00:33:21.140 --> 00:33:21.974
MATT: Okay.

00:33:21.974 --> 00:33:26.512
LAURA: You're free to go. Not toward your
stronghold, but towards the surface.

00:33:26.512 --> 00:33:29.458
MATT: So his belt falls, changepurse, and
everything.

00:33:29.591 --> 00:33:31.019
He is wearing full plate black armor--

00:33:31.019 --> 00:33:31.960
LIAM: Sure.

00:33:31.960 --> 00:33:33.418
MATT: So his trousers do not plummet.

00:33:33.418 --> 00:33:34.656
LIAM: Aw, that's a shame.

00:33:34.656 --> 00:33:36.109
TRAVIS: Can't we have Scanlan turn him into a
porpoise?

00:33:36.109 --> 00:33:40.241
MATT: He picks up his warhammer.

00:33:40.241 --> 00:33:47.533
TRAVIS: I don't think so. No, that's mine. As a
token to remember you by.

00:33:47.533 --> 00:33:50.113
MATT: "Unspoiled was the deal."

00:33:50.113 --> 00:33:51.363
LIAM: Wasn't the deal.

00:33:51.363 --> 00:33:52.930
TRAVIS: No, it's great. You can really argue all
you want to,

00:33:52.930 --> 00:33:54.928
or I'll just smash your fucking head in.

00:33:54.928 --> 00:33:55.982
LIAM: Wasn't the deal!

00:33:55.982 --> 00:33:57.385
TALIESIN: Alive was the deal.

00:33:57.385 --> 00:34:00.590
LIAM: We said you were alive, your weapons were
ours. What, have you got shit in your ears?

00:34:00.590 --> 00:34:03.127
ORION: I thought you meant you wouldn't get dirty,
like you know, not spoiled.

00:34:03.127 --> 00:34:07.080
Which I was totally fine with.

00:34:07.080 --> 00:34:11.191
MATT: Takes a couple of steps forward towards you,
holding the warhammer out.

00:34:11.191 --> 00:34:13.445
LIAM: Your skull is unspoiled.

00:34:13.445 --> 00:34:18.200
MATT: Suddenly, he turns completely invisible,
vanishes from sight.

00:34:18.200 --> 00:34:21.593
LAURA: My perception's really high, can I try to
find him?

00:34:21.593 --> 00:34:23.233
LIAM: Yeah, we can. Perception check.

00:34:23.233 --> 00:34:24.175
TRAVIS: You dicks.

00:34:24.175 --> 00:34:25.339
MATT: You hear (footsteps running).

00:34:25.339 --> 00:34:26.270
LIAM: Perception check.

00:34:26.270 --> 00:34:27.106
LAURA: Wait, no!

00:34:27.106 --> 00:34:27.825
ORION: He's gone.

00:34:27.825 --> 00:34:28.526
LAURA: Mother bitch.

00:34:28.526 --> 00:34:29.260
MARISHA: It's fine.

00:34:29.260 --> 00:34:30.242
LIAM: 18 for me.

00:34:30.242 --> 00:34:32.073
MARISHA: Just let him go, it's all he's got.

00:34:32.073 --> 00:34:32.939
ASHLEY: We should throw something.

00:34:32.939 --> 00:34:34.485
TRAVIS: (high-pitched) I want the hammer!

00:34:34.485 --> 00:34:36.547
MARISHA: It's all he's got right now. He's naked,
and now he's invisible running through a cavern.

00:34:36.547 --> 00:34:37.174
LAURA: He's not naked!

00:34:37.174 --> 00:34:38.209
MATT: At this point--

00:34:38.209 --> 00:34:39.429
LIAM: I'm gonna attack him.

00:34:39.429 --> 00:34:40.620
MATT: Before you have the opportunity--

00:34:40.620 --> 00:34:41.649
LIAM: Yeah?

00:34:41.649 --> 00:34:44.559
MATT: -- he becomes visible again, about 20 feet
out, gone down the stairs

00:34:44.559 --> 00:34:45.795
and towards the front door and he just--

00:34:45.795 --> 00:34:46.818
LIAM: I'm throwing a dagger at him.

00:34:46.818 --> 00:34:47.529
MARISHA: Oh look.

00:34:47.529 --> 00:34:48.361
MATT: Go for it.

00:34:48.361 --> 00:34:48.946
LIAM: Yeah.

00:34:48.946 --> 00:34:50.348
TRAVIS: And I'm throwing my ax at him with the
chain of returning as well.

00:34:50.348 --> 00:34:52.525
LIAM: Oh good, that's great. 28 for me.

00:34:52.525 --> 00:34:53.253
ORION: Oh shit.

00:34:53.253 --> 00:34:54.557
MATT: All right, that hits.

00:34:54.557 --> 00:34:55.529
LIAM: Yeah, sure it does. Dick!

00:34:55.529 --> 00:34:56.620
MATT: It's not a Sneak Attack, just damage.

00:34:56.620 --> 00:34:57.218
LIAM: Yeah, that's fine.

00:34:57.218 --> 00:34:58.124
MATT: You chuck your ax at him.

00:34:58.124 --> 00:34:58.898
TRAVIS: 17.

00:34:58.898 --> 00:35:00.321
MARISHA: And I just yell, sorry!

00:35:00.321 --> 00:35:01.650
MATT: Okay.

00:35:01.650 --> 00:35:02.454
TRAVIS: 17.

00:35:02.454 --> 00:35:03.637
LIAM: Ten for me.

00:35:03.637 --> 00:35:05.039
MATT: All right, so go ahead and roll damage for
both of you.

00:35:05.039 --> 00:35:05.894
LIAM: Ten.

00:35:05.894 --> 00:35:07.863
MATT: He is there, standing in place with his arms
locked like this.

00:35:07.863 --> 00:35:10.317
LAURA: Oh, Clarota.

00:35:10.317 --> 00:35:12.460
TRAVIS: 15.

00:35:12.460 --> 00:35:13.239
MATT: 15 damage?

00:35:13.239 --> 00:35:14.061
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:35:14.061 --> 00:35:14.711
MATT: All righty.

00:35:14.711 --> 00:35:15.678
TRAVIS: Should've left the hammer.

00:35:15.678 --> 00:35:16.558
LIAM: Ten.

00:35:16.558 --> 00:35:19.644
MATT: Ten damage, all right. There's now a
significant amount of blood beginning to pool down

00:35:19.644 --> 00:35:26.199
his feet, as he's standing there. As he is frozen
in place, Clarota just kinda steps up to the front

00:35:26.199 --> 00:35:31.240
of him, grabs his cheeks and pulls his head in
towards him, as his tendrils slowly wrap around

00:35:31.240 --> 00:35:37.736
his head. You can see them meet at the back of his
skull, and with this horrible crunching sound, you

00:35:37.736 --> 00:35:42.066
see his head shudder, as his limbs go limp.

00:35:42.066 --> 00:35:44.253
LIAM: (sings) Do do do do doo, I'm lovin' it.

00:35:44.253 --> 00:35:46.178
(all laugh)

00:35:46.178 --> 00:35:47.954
MATT: A few moments of this horrible slurping
sound--

00:35:47.954 --> 00:35:48.733
LAURA: Oh no.

00:35:48.733 --> 00:35:56.056
MATT: -- and you hear this dull, sickening, hollow
(suction) sound. The tentacles release, Clarota

00:35:56.056 --> 00:36:00.235
releases his grip from his head, and the captain
falls onto his back,

00:36:00.235 --> 00:36:03.096
a giant bloodied hole in the center of his skull.

00:36:03.096 --> 00:36:04.335
ASHLEY: He ate his brain?

00:36:04.335 --> 00:36:05.969
TRAVIS: I guess you should've left the hammer,
shouldn't you?

00:36:05.969 --> 00:36:07.721
TALIESIN: Some people are terrible losers, just
really terrible.

00:36:07.721 --> 00:36:09.029
ORION: I'm going to loot the body.

00:36:09.029 --> 00:36:11.046
LAURA: Yeah, well. Yeah, we definitely do that.

00:36:11.046 --> 00:36:12.596
TRAVIS: I would like to pick up the hammer.

00:36:12.596 --> 00:36:14.556
MARISHA: This is a good lesson, to no one else
that's watching.

00:36:14.556 --> 00:36:16.183
ORION: Clarota, that was incredible. Well done!

00:36:16.183 --> 00:36:16.921
LAURA: Clarota--

00:36:16.921 --> 00:36:18.017
ASHLEY: Clarota, I am a fan.

00:36:18.017 --> 00:36:19.579
MARISHA: No one is watching this valuable lesson.

00:36:19.579 --> 00:36:21.180
TALIESIN: Do not be an oathbreaker.

00:36:21.180 --> 00:36:22.516
MARISHA: To not be an oathbreaker.

00:36:22.516 --> 00:36:23.690
TALIESIN: Know when you've lost your clothes.

00:36:23.690 --> 00:36:25.827
LAURA: Was that actually, like, a meal for you?

00:36:25.827 --> 00:36:28.821
MATT: As you're looking, you can see there's that
kind of weird purplish crimson around his

00:36:28.821 --> 00:36:31.764
tendrils, as he kinda wipes it off with his hands,
and goes,

00:36:31.764 --> 00:36:37.680
"It's enough to sustain me a while. I 
was getting hungry."

00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:39.815
LAURA: Well. Better him than us, I say.

00:36:39.815 --> 00:36:41.574
TRAVIS: Right. Me, I'm just an appetizer.

00:36:41.574 --> 00:36:42.851
ORION: Yes, indeed.

00:36:42.851 --> 00:36:44.591
LAURA: Loot the body!

00:36:44.591 --> 00:36:49.303
MATT: Yes, so you loot the body. You find amongst
all the duergar bodies here, as you're quickly

00:36:49.303 --> 00:36:52.251
jumping around and grabbing, it's hard to count
the exact amount, but you're looking at somewhere

00:36:52.251 --> 00:36:55.324
in the neighbourhood of about five to six hundred
gold pieces. You'll have to check later.

00:36:55.324 --> 00:36:56.288
LAURA: Ooh!

00:36:56.288 --> 00:36:57.196
LIAM: Mm-hm.

00:36:57.196 --> 00:36:58.155
LAURA: I write that down.

00:36:58.155 --> 00:36:59.201
ORION: He was a general.

00:36:59.201 --> 00:37:01.659
MATT: A series of black iron weapons. None of them
seem to, at a quick glance, have any sort of

00:37:01.659 --> 00:37:07.307
magical value. The blackened plate armor on the
duergar itself does radiate a magical essence, as

00:37:07.307 --> 00:37:09.366
does the warhammer he was holding.

00:37:09.366 --> 00:37:11.207
LAURA: Is it just him wearing the black plate
armor--

00:37:11.207 --> 00:37:11.939
MATT: Yeah.

00:37:11.939 --> 00:37:13.039
LAURA: -- or any of the other bodies wearing it,
too?

00:37:13.039 --> 00:37:15.643
MATT: There are a few that are wearing black
plate, but they're not equivalent enchanted.

00:37:15.643 --> 00:37:18.395
LAURA: We should take that and put it in the bag
of holding, so we can sneak in if we want to.

00:37:18.395 --> 00:37:19.218
TRAVIS: Okay.

00:37:19.218 --> 00:37:20.900
LIAM: Tiberius, can you tell us anything about
these things?

00:37:20.900 --> 00:37:22.491
LAURA: How many sets were there?

00:37:22.491 --> 00:37:24.594
MATT: From what is in here, that would be 11 sets,
total.

00:37:24.594 --> 00:37:26.769
ORION: Yes, that hammer is amazing, obviously,
because we saw it in action.

00:37:26.769 --> 00:37:28.013
I'd say Grog should have it.

00:37:28.013 --> 00:37:29.461
LAURA: 11 sets of armor!

00:37:29.461 --> 00:37:31.614
MATT: Because there were also sets that were on
the rack at the very front.

00:37:31.614 --> 00:37:32.409
LAURA: Nice!

00:37:32.409 --> 00:37:33.301
ASHLEY: Hey.

00:37:33.301 --> 00:37:34.410
MARISHA: Is Grog about to get a new weapon?

00:37:34.410 --> 00:37:35.489
TRAVIS: 11 sets of armor, okay.

00:37:35.489 --> 00:37:37.700
ORION: And I'll do an arcana check, right? An
arcana check on the stuff?

00:37:37.700 --> 00:37:38.598
MATT: An arcana check, yeah.

00:37:38.598 --> 00:37:40.338
TALIESIN: Laura, you got a grapple arrow, last I
gave you, by the way.

00:37:40.338 --> 00:37:41.008
LAURA: I did?

00:37:41.008 --> 00:37:41.929
ORION: 23.

00:37:41.929 --> 00:37:43.245
TALIESIN: Yeah, I got it-- you now have a trap
arrow.

00:37:43.245 --> 00:37:44.158
LAURA: A grappler arrow?

00:37:44.158 --> 00:37:45.971
TALIESIN: Yeah, you fire it and it prones
somebody.

00:37:45.971 --> 00:37:48.086
LAURA: Seriously? That's so cool, thank you!

00:37:48.086 --> 00:37:49.078
MATT: There you go, sir.

00:37:49.078 --> 00:37:50.178
TALIESIN: I'm gonna Hawkeye you out at some
point.

00:37:50.178 --> 00:37:51.236
LAURA: Oh my gosh.

00:37:51.236 --> 00:37:52.041
TALIESIN: I know.

00:37:52.041 --> 00:37:53.468
TRAVIS: Can you do a magical check on the-- Oh,
he's got it.

00:37:53.468 --> 00:37:57.185
ORION: I did.

00:37:57.185 --> 00:37:58.455
MATT: So, as Tiberius is looking over the
equipment,

00:37:58.455 --> 00:38:01.462
kind of poring through his arcane knowledge.

00:38:01.462 --> 00:38:07.365
ORION: Oh, oh, ooh! I think Pike and Grog would
benefit from these, most definitely. Here.

00:38:07.365 --> 00:38:08.760
LAURA: What is it? What was it?

00:38:08.760 --> 00:38:11.460
LIAM: There's not any kind of dark magic about the
armor, is there?

00:38:11.460 --> 00:38:14.026
ORION: I mean, it's dark in color.

00:38:14.026 --> 00:38:15.252
LIAM: Yes, that's fine.

00:38:15.252 --> 00:38:17.185
ORION: But it's, you know, your standard arcana
magic.

00:38:17.185 --> 00:38:20.248
ASHLEY: Clarota, so when you eat their brains, do
you also get their thoughts, maybe?

00:38:20.248 --> 00:38:22.733
TRAVIS: Ooh! The heavy plate armor has resistance
to fire damage.

00:38:22.733 --> 00:38:24.056
ASHLEY: Or it's just-- it's gone after that.

00:38:24.056 --> 00:38:24.801
TRAVIS: The warhammer--

00:38:24.801 --> 00:38:25.895
LIAM: Sh!

00:38:25.895 --> 00:38:33.100
MATT: "There are residual memories, thoughts. It's
delicious." And you can see, there's this almost

00:38:33.100 --> 00:38:37.014
rapturous look in his face you haven't seen
before. For a moment, Clarota looks a little

00:38:37.014 --> 00:38:43.504
younger, a little stronger, a little more
dangerous. And you're put off a little bit by it.

00:38:43.504 --> 00:38:45.117
TRAVIS: Clarota is Dracula.

00:38:45.117 --> 00:38:48.545
MATT: But there's kind of this momentary kind of
relishing in the moment and--

00:38:48.545 --> 00:38:57.311
MARISHA: Do we need to give you a moment alone? We
can leave.

00:38:57.311 --> 00:39:01.308
MATT: "He speaks the truth about the path into the
Emberhold."

00:39:03.988 --> 00:39:05.183
LAURA: All right.

00:39:05.203 --> 00:39:10.719
LIAM: So, he spoke of some sort of trap door
that's easy to open from within,

00:39:10.779 --> 00:39:12.741
but not from outside, correct?

00:39:12.741 --> 00:39:14.779
MARISHA: It was hidden by a lava flow.

00:39:14.779 --> 00:39:16.866
LAURA: Yes, two lava flows--

00:39:16.866 --> 00:39:17.891
MATT: The smaller of the two.

00:39:17.891 --> 00:39:19.025
LAURA: -- the smaller of the two.

00:39:19.025 --> 00:39:20.027
LIAM: The smaller of the two.

00:39:20.027 --> 00:39:20.965
MATT: On the left side.

00:39:20.965 --> 00:39:21.963
MARISHA: On the left side of the keep.

00:39:21.963 --> 00:39:22.897
LAURA: Yes. Can I ask a question?

00:39:22.897 --> 00:39:23.627
MATT: Yes?

00:39:23.627 --> 00:39:24.500
TRAVIS: I'm raising my hand.

00:39:24.500 --> 00:39:25.734
LAURA: Are there a lot of other soldiers still in
the camp, or did we--

00:39:25.734 --> 00:39:27.950
MATT: Oh, there are plenty of soldiers still in
the camp.

00:39:27.950 --> 00:39:28.586
LIAM: Yeah, we--

00:39:28.586 --> 00:39:29.316
LAURA: Ooh.

00:39:29.316 --> 00:39:30.847
MATT: You stealthed into the barracks.

00:39:30.847 --> 00:39:35.324
LAURA: Oh shit! We should've kept him alive, you
guys! Okay, okay, okay. Yes, Grog?

00:39:35.324 --> 00:39:36.998
LIAM: Well, he was about to walk out the door and
cause mayhem.

00:39:36.998 --> 00:39:37.904
ORION: That's true.

00:39:37.904 --> 00:39:39.167
MARISHA: That's true. He was gonna alert
everybody.

00:39:39.167 --> 00:39:42.800
TRAVIS: Can I harvest any natural armor from the
bulette? The kitty?

00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:43.712
LAURA: Ooh!

00:39:43.712 --> 00:39:46.533
MATT: You can certainly try. There's plates that
have been broken and cracked.

00:39:46.533 --> 00:39:48.529
You can try and start cleaving away at it.

00:39:48.529 --> 00:39:51.721
TRAVIS: All right, yes, I start butchering, or
something, the bulette.

00:39:51.721 --> 00:39:55.512
MATT: Okay, you start-- It's really tough hide.
You know, 'cause you tried to cut through before

00:39:55.512 --> 00:39:59.830
and you managed to make a few marks. It takes you
a few minutes. You manage to get, let's say, about

00:39:59.830 --> 00:40:06.813
three saucer-shaped pieces of armor out of it.

00:40:06.813 --> 00:40:08.005
TRAVIS: All right.

00:40:08.005 --> 00:40:12.408
MATT: You could definitely get more, but then you
start hearing bells going off.

00:40:12.408 --> 00:40:13.554
LAURA and TRAVIS: Shit.

00:40:13.554 --> 00:40:15.014
ORION: What do I see? I'm still on the roof.

00:40:15.014 --> 00:40:16.365
LAURA: Okay, we should all-- Can we all--

00:40:16.365 --> 00:40:19.840
MATT: You don't see anything yet. You just hear
bells starting to go off in the city.

00:40:19.840 --> 00:40:23.427
LAURA: Okay, we should all put on black armor.
Does that matter?

00:40:23.427 --> 00:40:25.762
LIAM: We should just get out of here. Keyleth, can
you fucking eagle up and let's go.

00:40:25.762 --> 00:40:27.081
MATT: You start hearing horns.

00:40:27.081 --> 00:40:28.445
LAURA: We need to free those dwarves.

00:40:28.445 --> 00:40:29.181
MARISHA: Eagle up?

00:40:29.181 --> 00:40:32.384
MATT: Big horns. You start seeing torches being
lit.

00:40:32.384 --> 00:40:33.956
LAURA: Stealth, stealth. And get out. Go stealth
and get out.

00:40:33.956 --> 00:40:35.054
LIAM: We need to get out, now.

00:40:35.054 --> 00:40:36.456
ORION: Oh guys, the jig is up!

00:40:36.456 --> 00:40:38.313
LAURA: I shoot my grapple thing and go up out of
the ceiling.

00:40:38.313 --> 00:40:39.328
LIAM: Tiberius.

00:40:39.328 --> 00:40:40.080
ORION: What?

00:40:40.080 --> 00:40:41.814
LIAM: Cast Fly on this fucker right here, we need
to get out of here.

00:40:41.814 --> 00:40:43.860
We just need to get out the way we came in.

00:40:43.860 --> 00:40:52.141
MARISHA: I cast Pass Without A Trace. Everyone
stand near me. And I'll turn into an eagle

00:40:52.141 --> 00:40:53.780
and I scoop up the gnomes.

00:40:53.780 --> 00:40:57.606
MATT: Okay, what's the radius on Pass Without A
Trace?

00:40:57.606 --> 00:40:58.843
LIAM: Like a thousand yards.

00:40:58.843 --> 00:40:59.711
MARISHA: Like a hundred yards.

00:40:59.711 --> 00:41:02.142
MATT: Four miles, it's all I got.

00:41:02.142 --> 00:41:06.523
LAURA: But I take the dust of tracelessness out of
the bag of holding

00:41:06.523 --> 00:41:08.376
and I sprinkle it around the room.

00:41:08.376 --> 00:41:14.307
MATT: Okay.

00:41:14.307 --> 00:41:16.227
LAURA: Can we grapple up out from the ceiling?

00:41:16.227 --> 00:41:19.341
MATT: Well, the arrow that you have that he made,
it's essentially an arrow that bursts into a

00:41:19.341 --> 00:41:21.981
tanglefoot bag. When it bursts, it grapples
whoever's there,

00:41:21.981 --> 00:41:23.258
it's not like grappling an arrow.

00:41:23.258 --> 00:41:24.631
TALIESIN: Yeah, it's not like a string arrow,
although I'll build that.

00:41:24.631 --> 00:41:25.606
LAURA: Oh, I thought it was like a grappling--

00:41:25.606 --> 00:41:26.890
TALIESIN: It's a trip arrow.

00:41:26.890 --> 00:41:27.740
LAURA: Oh, that's cool, okay.

00:41:27.740 --> 00:41:28.943
MARISHA: A 30-foot radius.

00:41:28.943 --> 00:41:30.115
TALIESIN: I'll make you a grappling-- I didn't
follow that though.

00:41:30.115 --> 00:41:31.667
I'll make you a grappling arrow.

00:41:31.667 --> 00:41:33.295
LAURA: I have a grappling hook. Yeah, we should
grapple out.

00:41:33.295 --> 00:41:34.594
MATT: 30-foot radius, okay, so you could just--

00:41:34.594 --> 00:41:35.446
MARISHA: Just, hug me.

00:41:35.446 --> 00:41:36.466
MATT: -- barely get Tiberius in there if you--

00:41:36.466 --> 00:41:37.419
MARISHA: Stay close.

00:41:37.419 --> 00:41:38.327
TRAVIS: You can go on my back.

00:41:38.327 --> 00:41:39.372
MATT: On the platform, so yeah.

00:41:39.372 --> 00:41:40.731
ASHLEY: Okay, I'm gonna jump on Grog's back.

00:41:40.731 --> 00:41:42.281
TRAVIS: Yeah, and I pick up Scanlan under my arm.

00:41:42.281 --> 00:41:43.954
LAURA: We have a regular grappling hook, we'll
just get up out of the--

00:41:43.954 --> 00:41:45.209
TALIESIN: We have a flying carpet.

00:41:45.209 --> 00:41:46.342
ASHLEY: And hold onto some straps.

00:41:46.342 --> 00:41:51.374
MATT: All right, so Scanlan-- Both gnomes get
grabbed by Keyleth as--

00:41:51.374 --> 00:41:54.167
ORION: And we're all on the carpet?

00:41:54.167 --> 00:41:56.895
LIAM: The carpet's away, but this guy is flying?

00:41:56.895 --> 00:41:57.646
ORION: Yes.

00:41:57.646 --> 00:41:58.554
LIAM: Flying Grog.

00:41:58.554 --> 00:41:59.876
TRAVIS: I am? I thought we were all-- Okay.

00:41:59.876 --> 00:42:01.235
LIAM: No, you can't go on the carpet. You're too
heavy.

00:42:01.235 --> 00:42:02.241
LAURA: What are we doing?

00:42:02.241 --> 00:42:03.676
LIAM: We're going up. Straight up.

00:42:03.676 --> 00:42:06.281
LAURA: Up and out. Can we stealth, while we do
it?

00:42:06.281 --> 00:42:08.654
MATT: So, you guys, right now, as you're carrying
the two gnomes,

00:42:08.654 --> 00:42:11.745
all of you except for Grog are on the carpet, 
correct?

00:42:11.745 --> 00:42:12.782
TRAVIS: Yep, I'm flying.

00:42:12.782 --> 00:42:17.959
MATT: You're flying. Okay, so how many spells do
you have left on that? One left? All right.

00:42:17.959 --> 00:42:19.538
LAURA: Where's Trinket?

00:42:19.538 --> 00:42:20.950
TALIESIN: Trinket's back on the other side.

00:42:20.950 --> 00:42:22.609
MATT: Trinket's back on the other side. Trinket
didn't come with you to the battle, because there

00:42:22.609 --> 00:42:23.806
was nobody to get Trinket across.

00:42:23.806 --> 00:42:25.039
LAURA: Oh, he's just on the other side by himself,
all lonely?

00:42:25.039 --> 00:42:25.987
MATT: Yeah, I know.

00:42:25.987 --> 00:42:26.839
LIAM: He's in goblin town.

00:42:26.839 --> 00:42:27.643
MATT: Eh, you weren't here.

00:42:27.643 --> 00:42:29.820
(all laugh)

00:42:29.820 --> 00:42:31.311
MATT: You weren't here to protect your bear.

00:42:31.311 --> 00:42:32.141
LAURA: That's so terrible.

00:42:32.141 --> 00:42:33.290
ASHLEY: He's safe over there?

00:42:33.290 --> 00:42:34.531
MATT: Hopefully.

00:42:34.531 --> 00:42:35.638
ASHLEY: Oh Trinket!

00:42:35.638 --> 00:42:36.717
TRAVIS: He's been raging.

00:42:36.717 --> 00:42:43.013
MATT: Everyone, make a stealth check. With a plus
ten additional modifier

00:42:43.013 --> 00:42:44.864
thanks to Keyleth's spell.

00:42:44.864 --> 00:42:49.418
TRAVIS: Oh, awesome. That helped.

00:42:49.418 --> 00:42:51.424
ORION: 20.

00:42:51.424 --> 00:42:52.258
ASHLEY: Oh, 20!

00:42:52.258 --> 00:42:53.091
MARISHA: 18.

00:42:53.091 --> 00:42:54.108
TRAVIS: Natural? Oh.

00:42:54.108 --> 00:42:55.101
LAURA: Nice. Ooh, natural 20!

00:42:55.101 --> 00:42:56.141
TALIESIN: 19.

00:42:56.141 --> 00:42:58.030
TRAVIS: 19.

00:42:58.030 --> 00:42:59.181
ASHLEY: 20.

00:42:59.181 --> 00:43:00.724
LAURA and TRAVIS: Natural 20.

00:43:00.724 --> 00:43:01.864
LAURA: 31 for me.

00:43:01.864 --> 00:43:02.844
LIAM: 29.

00:43:02.844 --> 00:43:08.473
MATT: All right, so you all take off. As you do,
you can see now, probably close to 30 or 40

00:43:08.473 --> 00:43:12.311
duergar have now begun rushing towards the
barracks in the center of that main open area

00:43:12.311 --> 00:43:18.402
where that wooden platform was, where Scanlan
originally saw a mind flayer. As you rush up, you

00:43:18.402 --> 00:43:25.738
hear (speaks Undercommon). You hear it as
Undercommon, screaming, "There! Above, look!"

00:43:25.738 --> 00:43:26.719
LAURA: Oh, they saw us.

00:43:26.719 --> 00:43:28.093
ASHLEY: Maybe you should scream, like, no, they
went the other way!

00:43:28.093 --> 00:43:29.618
LIAM: Just keep going up, up, up.

00:43:29.618 --> 00:43:31.413
MATT: A stream of javelins comes firing up in your
direction.

00:43:31.413 --> 00:43:32.989
LAURA: How did they see us? I thought we were
stealthed.

00:43:32.989 --> 00:43:34.942
ORION: I see where it's coming and I shoot a
Fireball.

00:43:34.942 --> 00:43:36.708
MATT: Okay.

00:43:36.708 --> 00:43:38.204
LIAM: That's good, that's good.

00:43:38.204 --> 00:43:39.352
MARISHA: Wait, what are you doing?

00:43:39.352 --> 00:43:44.662
MATT: Okay, so there's a volley of javelins and a
Fireball streaking past. You'll be able to get ten

00:43:44.662 --> 00:43:50.309
of them in that Fireball blast, go ahead and roll
for damage on that. However, for those that rolled

00:43:50.309 --> 00:43:56.572
less than 20 on stealth, each of you are getting
three javelins each to you. So that's you two, and

00:43:56.572 --> 00:43:57.982
Grog. What'd you roll again?

00:43:57.982 --> 00:43:59.090
MARISHA: Less than 20.

00:43:59.090 --> 00:43:59.889
ORION: 22.

00:43:59.889 --> 00:44:09.629
MATT: Okay, yeah. So you three. So three javelins
against you, miss you entirely. Percy. Actually,

00:44:09.629 --> 00:44:17.955
one more against you, Keyleth. That one does hit.
You take 14 points of piercing damage as the

00:44:18.033 --> 00:44:21.021
javelin just gleans off the side of your giant
eagle torso.

00:44:21.021 --> 00:44:22.371
MARISHA: (eagle noises)

00:44:22.371 --> 00:44:31.182
MATT: Percy, that's a 21, an 18, and a 20. So you
take three javelins.

00:44:31.182 --> 00:44:37.626
24 points of piercing damage.

00:44:37.626 --> 00:44:38.775
TALIESIN: 24 points?

00:44:38.775 --> 00:44:42.506
MATT: Yeah, 24 points total, as three javelins--
Two strike you off the shoulders and one actually

00:44:42.506 --> 00:44:46.040
embeds itself partway into your waist and you have
to pull it out,

00:44:46.040 --> 00:44:48.543
and probably dug a good six, seven inches in.

00:44:48.543 --> 00:44:49.715
ASHLEY: What are you at?

00:44:49.715 --> 00:44:50.973
TALIESIN: I'm at 15.

00:44:50.973 --> 00:44:51.936
ASHLEY: 15?

00:44:51.936 --> 00:44:53.258
ORION: By the way, 41 points of fire damage.

00:44:53.258 --> 00:44:55.080
TALIESIN: I was already really low.

00:44:55.080 --> 00:44:56.172
TRAVIS: Take me instead.

00:44:56.172 --> 00:44:57.183
LAURA: We haven't healed him yet.

00:44:57.183 --> 00:44:58.459
ASHLEY: Wait, we healed the other game. Even with
that?

00:44:58.459 --> 00:44:59.564
TALIESIN: Oh, did I fully heal?

00:44:59.564 --> 00:45:00.961
MATT: All right, the three that are going towards
Grog--

00:45:00.961 --> 00:45:01.819
TRAVIS: Yeah, come on.

00:45:01.819 --> 00:45:03.466
MATT: That-- Natural 20. A 17, what's your AC?

00:45:03.466 --> 00:45:04.304
ASHLEY: No, it was like 24.

00:45:04.304 --> 00:45:05.226
TRAVIS: 18.

00:45:05.226 --> 00:45:06.025
ASHLEY: 24 points.

00:45:06.025 --> 00:45:07.022
MATT: That one misses, and the last one-- Yeah,
two natural 20s.

00:45:07.022 --> 00:45:07.773
TALIESIN: Yeah.

00:45:07.773 --> 00:45:08.574
ASHLEY: That was 24.

00:45:08.574 --> 00:45:09.268
MATT: Not even joking.

00:45:09.268 --> 00:45:10.195
LIAM: Double crits, oh.

00:45:10.195 --> 00:45:11.013
MATT: All right, so--

00:45:11.013 --> 00:45:12.015
LAURA: Two crits against you?

00:45:12.015 --> 00:45:12.955
LIAM: Good thing you got a thousand hit points.

00:45:12.955 --> 00:45:14.469
TRAVIS: (high-pitched) Oh no.

00:45:14.469 --> 00:45:15.781
LIAM: That's the point of a meat tank.

00:45:15.781 --> 00:45:18.114
MATT: You take a total of 36 points of piercing
damage, Grog.

00:45:18.114 --> 00:45:19.988
ASHLEY: And he still has more hitpoints than we
do.

00:45:19.988 --> 00:45:20.824
MATT: Yeah, probably.

00:45:20.824 --> 00:45:21.586
MARISHA: Ouchies.

00:45:21.586 --> 00:45:22.499
MATT: Oh, barbarian.

00:45:22.499 --> 00:45:24.308
LIAM: If Scanlan were here, he'd moon and blind
all.

00:45:24.308 --> 00:45:26.675
LAURA: He is here, technically.

00:45:26.675 --> 00:45:28.486
MATT: He is here, Scanlan's holding on tight as--

00:45:28.486 --> 00:45:29.735
LIAM: He's here, he's watching.

00:45:29.735 --> 00:45:31.646
TALIESIN: Scanlan's peeing, peeing down.

00:45:31.646 --> 00:45:34.714
MATT: However, as the javelins strike all you
guys, moments later there's a gargantuan

00:45:34.714 --> 00:45:41.720
explosion, and there's a flash of reddish light
from below. A giant fiery blooming explosion

00:45:41.720 --> 00:45:45.866
bursts into the center of that area. You can see
duergar thrown left and right. You manage to take

00:45:45.866 --> 00:45:47.730
out about 12 of them in that one blast.

00:45:47.730 --> 00:45:48.437
ORION: Yes!

00:45:48.437 --> 00:45:49.275
LAURA: Nice!

00:45:49.275 --> 00:45:50.323
LIAM: Yeah, home slice.

00:45:50.323 --> 00:45:53.349
MATT: You guys continue, cresting over the top.
You can now see more and more are starting to

00:45:53.349 --> 00:45:56.763
gather, the bells are going off, the horns are
blowing hard. You can see a bunch of them are now

00:45:56.763 --> 00:45:59.849
running over to what looks like some of this siege
equipment they had constructed--

00:45:59.849 --> 00:46:00.931
MARISHA and LAURA: Oh.

00:46:00.931 --> 00:46:04.031
MATT: Which includes a few large ballistae.

00:46:04.031 --> 00:46:08.689
LIAM: I think we should friggin' dive bomb towards
the far tunnel past this war camp.

00:46:08.689 --> 00:46:10.144
LAURA: No, but Trinket!

00:46:10.144 --> 00:46:11.692
LIAM: Is fine, he's hiding out. They don't know
he's here.

00:46:11.692 --> 00:46:12.772
TRAVIS: Leave him.

00:46:12.772 --> 00:46:13.635
TALIESIN: He'll be fine.

00:46:13.635 --> 00:46:16.533
ORION: I'm not concerned with the bear right now!

00:46:16.533 --> 00:46:18.285
LIAM: We're going to dive. Yes, dive bomb, dive
bomb!

00:46:18.285 --> 00:46:21.246
TALIESIN: The bear can take care of himself.

00:46:21.246 --> 00:46:23.837
LIAM: I take hold of the front of the carpet and
steer it up and over, along the roof and then down

00:46:23.923 --> 00:46:26.180
towards the tunnel. I'm steering the carpet.

00:46:26.245 --> 00:46:30.808
MATT: Okay. You guys are coming down. You
basically shot up, curved around--

00:46:30.892 --> 00:46:32.167
LAURA: We shouldn't go down.

00:46:32.167 --> 00:46:35.737
MATT: And you're going backwards towards the
barracks. As you do, another volley of--

00:46:35.737 --> 00:46:39.333
LAURA: We got to free those dwarves, y'all.

00:46:39.333 --> 00:46:41.166
MATT: Another volley comes to the guys who were
under-stealthed.

00:46:41.166 --> 00:46:42.701
LIAM: We don't have to. That seems complicated.

00:46:42.701 --> 00:46:43.843
ORION: Who's not stealthed?

00:46:43.843 --> 00:46:47.719
MATT: However, there is one attack less each
because of the duergar that you had taken out. So,

00:46:47.719 --> 00:46:53.955
against Keyleth, one hits. You take 12 points of
piercing damage.

00:46:53.955 --> 00:46:58.039
MARISHA: I am no longer an eagle.

00:46:58.039 --> 00:46:59.238
TALIESIN: Oh my God.

00:46:59.238 --> 00:47:00.218
TRAVIS: Oh shit, really?

00:47:00.218 --> 00:47:01.718
MATT: All right, a two and a one versus Percy.

00:47:01.718 --> 00:47:02.783
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:47:02.783 --> 00:47:04.143
TRAVIS: Are you paying attention?

00:47:04.143 --> 00:47:05.045
ORION: Wait, what?

00:47:05.045 --> 00:47:06.154
TRAVIS: She's not an eagle anymore.

00:47:06.154 --> 00:47:06.829
MATT: All right, so.

00:47:06.829 --> 00:47:07.743
LAURA: Keyleth isn't a--

00:47:07.743 --> 00:47:09.082
MARISHA: I hit zero hit points as an eagle.

00:47:09.082 --> 00:47:09.905
ASHLEY: Wait, what are you again?

00:47:09.905 --> 00:47:10.738
LAURA: What happened?

00:47:10.738 --> 00:47:12.156
LIAM: She's not an eagle and she's falling with
the gnomes.

00:47:12.156 --> 00:47:16.864
MATT: Keyleth's form shifts back into that of
Keyleth. You guys are about 80 feet up.

00:47:16.864 --> 00:47:17.869
MARISHA: Help!

00:47:17.869 --> 00:47:18.845
LAURA: Okay, okay!

00:47:18.845 --> 00:47:19.808
ASHLEY: Can I--

00:47:19.808 --> 00:47:23.036
MATT: At which point, both Scanlan and Pike go
into a free fall along with Keyleth.

00:47:23.036 --> 00:47:23.841
ASHLEY: Wait, can I--

00:47:23.841 --> 00:47:25.095
LAURA: No, no, she was on Grog, she was--

00:47:25.095 --> 00:47:26.166
ORION: Are we under them? Are we under them?

00:47:26.166 --> 00:47:27.047
LIAM: I don't know, are we?

00:47:27.047 --> 00:47:27.975
ASHLEY: No, I was on her.

00:47:27.975 --> 00:47:29.146
MATT: No, you guys are about parallel. You guys
were moving together.

00:47:29.146 --> 00:47:29.901
LIAM: Parallel?

00:47:29.901 --> 00:47:30.808
ORION: Go under them!

00:47:30.808 --> 00:47:31.666
LAURA: Yeah, we dive under them.

00:47:31.666 --> 00:47:32.719
LIAM: Dive, dive, dive, dive!

00:47:32.719 --> 00:47:37.040
ORION: I cast Glacial Blast and I create a bridge
that scoops them up, right under them.

00:47:37.040 --> 00:47:38.855
As we dive right under them.

00:47:38.855 --> 00:47:40.200
LIAM: Party trick.

00:47:40.200 --> 00:47:44.081
MATT: Okay, you guys are out in the middle of the
open cavern. There's no place to connect the

00:47:44.081 --> 00:47:47.423
bridge, so you're essentially creating a giant
ice--

00:47:47.423 --> 00:47:48.531
LIAM and LAURA: Chunk.

00:47:48.531 --> 00:47:50.385
MATT: Chunk right beneath them. Which is also now
in freefall.

00:47:50.385 --> 00:47:51.725
ORION: Huh? No!

00:47:51.725 --> 00:47:52.515
MATT: Yes.

00:47:52.515 --> 00:47:53.623
LIAM: Even wizards make mistakes.

00:47:53.623 --> 00:47:54.666
ORION: Damn it!

00:47:54.666 --> 00:47:57.730
MATT: So as you guys try and swoop underneath as
they're plummeting-- You're riding this, go ahead

00:47:57.730 --> 00:47:59.741
and make an acrobatics check.

00:47:59.741 --> 00:48:00.969
LIAM: Okay.

00:48:00.969 --> 00:48:01.844
ORION: No, I didn't think of that.

00:48:01.844 --> 00:48:02.940
MARISHA: I don't know what to do.

00:48:02.940 --> 00:48:04.231
LAURA: Can we try to catch-- can we try to-- what
do I have?

00:48:04.231 --> 00:48:05.427
ASHLEY: Wait, can I--

00:48:05.427 --> 00:48:06.504
TRAVIS: Are we over the war camp, or are we over
the--

00:48:06.504 --> 00:48:07.561
LIAM: 25.

00:48:07.561 --> 00:48:08.456
LAURA: Over the war camp.

00:48:08.456 --> 00:48:12.372
MATT: All right, so you swoop underneath. A sudden
motion, as you're trying to cast. Go ahead and

00:48:12.453 --> 00:48:13.910
roll a concentration check on this.

00:48:13.910 --> 00:48:15.516
MARISHA: Oh, come on, Tiberius.

00:48:15.516 --> 00:48:16.603
TALIESIN: Oh boy.

00:48:16.603 --> 00:48:20.130
MARISHA: Oh, save my life, again, Tiberius.

00:48:20.130 --> 00:48:21.043
ORION: Oh no.

00:48:21.043 --> 00:48:21.861
LAURA: Can I try to--

00:48:21.861 --> 00:48:22.576
MARISHA: Oh shit.

00:48:22.576 --> 00:48:23.742
LIAM: I let go of the front of the carpet, I stick
a--

00:48:23.742 --> 00:48:25.979
ASHLEY: Wait, wait, wait, wait, can I cast War
God's Blessing to give him a plus ten?

00:48:25.979 --> 00:48:26.975
MATT: Unfortunately, you're falling.

00:48:26.975 --> 00:48:27.833
ASHLEY: Fuck.

00:48:27.833 --> 00:48:30.139
MATT: You're like (worried noise), you're just
plummeting through the air like a rock because

00:48:30.139 --> 00:48:31.288
you're in full plate armor.

00:48:31.288 --> 00:48:33.408
LAURA: Can I use the rope of endless twine and try
to lasso one of them?

00:48:33.408 --> 00:48:34.996
'Cause I'm really a good shot.

00:48:34.996 --> 00:48:36.039
ASHLEY: How far are we falling?

00:48:36.039 --> 00:48:37.738
MATT: You have to pull it out of the bag of
holding and then turn into a lasso, that's gonna

00:48:37.738 --> 00:48:39.167
take you a full minute, so you don't have time.

00:48:39.167 --> 00:48:42.045
LIAM: I have a rope. I let go of the front of the
carpet, I put one end of the rope in my sister's

00:48:42.045 --> 00:48:46.664
hand, and I jump off towards Pike, holding it
around in one hand as I go--

00:48:46.664 --> 00:48:47.665
LAURA: Oh god.

00:48:47.665 --> 00:48:48.604
TALIESIN: I grapple onto her to hold her down.

00:48:48.604 --> 00:48:49.966
ASHLEY: No! No, no, no, I have so much armor.

00:48:49.966 --> 00:48:50.902
LAURA: Okay, then you should--

00:48:50.902 --> 00:48:53.297
MATT: All right guys, so here's what happens. In
the time this has transpired, you've rushed

00:48:53.297 --> 00:49:00.815
underneath with the magic carpet, all of you
barely managed to hold on, as both Pike and

00:49:00.815 --> 00:49:05.064
Scanlan and Keyleth all slam into the top of
the--

00:49:05.064 --> 00:49:07.171
LAURA: Oh okay, except you're dangling off of it
now by a rope.

00:49:07.171 --> 00:49:09.031
MATT: You lost your concentration, so Glacial
Blast didn't go off, thankfully.

00:49:09.031 --> 00:49:10.525
That would've been really bad.

00:49:10.525 --> 00:49:12.420
MARISHA: Wait, wait, we slam into the top of
what?

00:49:12.420 --> 00:49:13.314
TALIESIN: Us.

00:49:13.314 --> 00:49:15.427
MATT: You guys slam onto the top of the rest of
the group, in there.

00:49:15.427 --> 00:49:17.086
LAURA: That's too many people on the carpet.

00:49:17.086 --> 00:49:20.684
MATT: Because you lost your concentration, your
flight spell also dissipates.

00:49:20.684 --> 00:49:21.803
Grog is now plummeting.

00:49:21.803 --> 00:49:22.545
LAURA: Oh no!

00:49:22.545 --> 00:49:23.230
TRAVIS: Yay!

00:49:23.230 --> 00:49:26.203
ALL: (worried noises)

00:49:26.203 --> 00:49:27.216
LAURA: We're gonna die!

00:49:27.216 --> 00:49:29.263
MATT: The carpet now has too much weight and is
currently giving out.

00:49:29.263 --> 00:49:32.292
LIAM: #savecriticalrole.

00:49:32.292 --> 00:49:34.474
ORION: Get me close to him. I cast Featherfall on
you.

00:49:34.474 --> 00:49:38.912
MATT: It's slowing your fall, but you guys are--
you're coming down at a very, very fast pace at an

00:49:38.912 --> 00:49:41.942
angle over the barracks towards the back end of
the war camp.

00:49:41.942 --> 00:49:42.769
LAURA: Oh shit.

00:49:42.769 --> 00:49:46.505
MARISHA: Can I cast Wind Wall right underneath of
the carpet to kind of like airbend us up?

00:49:46.505 --> 00:49:48.428
MATT: You can attempt to. Grog--

00:49:48.428 --> 00:49:50.310
TRAVIS: I begin to fart to slow the fall.

00:49:50.310 --> 00:49:52.341
ORION: Who needs Featherfall? I can do it in a
bunch!

00:49:52.341 --> 00:49:53.279
MARISHA: Ahh!

00:49:53.279 --> 00:49:54.457
MATT: Everybody, at this point--

00:49:54.457 --> 00:49:55.296
LIAM: But wait, Dungeon Master?

00:49:55.296 --> 00:49:56.054
MATT: Yes.

00:49:56.054 --> 00:49:58.873
LIAM: Re-explain what's happening. So the carpet
is falling, not as fast as it would, but--

00:49:58.873 --> 00:50:02.077
MATT: Essentially, you guys are flying beside each
other, the three that were falling, you guys

00:50:02.077 --> 00:50:06.443
swooped underneath and caught them, however it's
too much weight to bear, the carpet's now--

00:50:06.443 --> 00:50:08.828
LIAM: How high are we at this second?

00:50:08.828 --> 00:50:11.688
MATT: At this second, you're about 60-70 feet up.

00:50:11.688 --> 00:50:12.421
MARISHA: Ohh.

00:50:12.421 --> 00:50:14.536
LIAM: And the closest building, the highest
building under us is how tall?

00:50:14.536 --> 00:50:15.530
MARISHA: Oh, Jesus.

00:50:15.530 --> 00:50:18.242
MATT: It's about 15 feet tall.

00:50:18.242 --> 00:50:19.340
LIAM: Ohh.

00:50:19.340 --> 00:50:25.360
MATT: Grog, however, goes into a full plummet. You
guys have just caught the rest of them, you've all

00:50:25.360 --> 00:50:27.967
caught them, you're crashing down.

00:50:27.967 --> 00:50:30.765
MARISHA: And did the Wind Wall thing work?

00:50:30.765 --> 00:50:31.862
MATT: Go ahead and roll a concentration.

00:50:31.862 --> 00:50:33.228
LAURA: Everybody jump up in the air!

00:50:33.228 --> 00:50:34.736
MATT: Your constitution modifier.

00:50:34.736 --> 00:50:41.296
MARISHA: Fucking shit. Not good. Seven.

00:50:41.296 --> 00:50:46.286
MATT: The spell fizzles.

00:50:46.286 --> 00:50:49.517
LIAM: Unpause. How far are we from the tunnel that
we were talking about?

00:50:49.517 --> 00:50:53.988
MATT: From what you can see here, you're probably
about 50 to 60 feet.

00:50:54.019 --> 00:50:55.905
LAURA: We're right over the camp, aren't we?

00:50:55.905 --> 00:50:59.125
MATT: You're towards the back of it, thankfully,
the barracks are towards the back of it, so maybe

00:50:59.125 --> 00:51:02.381
about 50 to 60 feet from the full tunnel.

00:51:02.381 --> 00:51:05.093
ORION: Before where the drop is, and that's where
that bottom tunnel is down there?

00:51:05.093 --> 00:51:05.870
MATT: Yep.

00:51:05.870 --> 00:51:06.715
ORION: Okay.

00:51:06.715 --> 00:51:09.644
MATT: You guys go crashing at an angle.

00:51:09.708 --> 00:51:12.862
TALIESIN: I'm going to brace to jump. I'm bracing to roll.

00:51:12.862 --> 00:51:14.205
LAURA: Yeah, we're all like bracing.

00:51:14.205 --> 00:51:15.586
MARISHA: Three-point landing!

00:51:15.586 --> 00:51:17.660
LIAM: I'm grabbing for Pike and going like this.

00:51:17.660 --> 00:51:18.644
LAURA: I have Scanlan!

00:51:18.644 --> 00:51:19.899
MARISHA: What's Grog doing?

00:51:19.899 --> 00:51:21.100
ORION: Where's Grog at?

00:51:21.100 --> 00:51:22.051
LAURA: He's falling.

00:51:22.051 --> 00:51:23.273
LIAM: Grog's gone. Grog's down.

00:51:23.273 --> 00:51:25.336
MATT: Grog is completely separate from you. He was
flying, and lost concentration of his spell.

00:51:25.336 --> 00:51:26.317
Grog's like a stone.

00:51:26.317 --> 00:51:27.382
LAURA: No, Grog!

00:51:27.382 --> 00:51:28.591
ORION: Can I leap towards him?

00:51:28.591 --> 00:51:29.494
TALIESIN: Off what?

00:51:29.494 --> 00:51:30.596
MARISHA: And do what?

00:51:30.596 --> 00:51:31.317
MATT: Off of the carpet--

00:51:31.317 --> 00:51:32.486
ORION: Off of the carpet! Yes!

00:51:32.486 --> 00:51:33.557
LIAM: Do what?

00:51:33.557 --> 00:51:34.726
LAURA: You leap off of the carpet?

00:51:34.726 --> 00:51:39.670
MATT: Go ahead and make an acrobatics check. With
a disadvantage, because you are jumping off of a

00:51:39.670 --> 00:51:43.885
currently flimsy flying carpet to try and catch up
to him.

00:51:43.885 --> 00:51:46.432
LAURA: Oh no.

00:51:46.634 --> 00:51:50.313
ORION: Right now, while I'm doing this, I'm going
to cast Featherfall on myself.

00:51:50.313 --> 00:51:53.857
TRAVIS: Wait, before, you gotta get to me first,
because it will slow you too much.

00:51:53.857 --> 00:51:57.027
ORION: Oh. It would, wouldn't it? I thought it was
only when going down.

00:51:57.027 --> 00:51:58.326
TRAVIS: Gotta get to me first, motherfucker.

00:51:58.326 --> 00:51:59.515
MATT: Go for it.

00:51:59.515 --> 00:52:01.039
ORION: Whoa. Okay.

00:52:01.039 --> 00:52:03.548
MATT: So what's your acrobatics check? The lower
of the two.

00:52:03.548 --> 00:52:04.829
LIAM: You fall a lot.

00:52:04.829 --> 00:52:06.342
TRAVIS: Yeah. Big things go down.

00:52:06.342 --> 00:52:08.215
ORION: 15 and 13.

00:52:08.215 --> 00:52:15.133
MATT: Okay. You manage to fumble out of the
carpet, however, you are now just end-over-end

00:52:15.133 --> 00:52:17.507
falling now off of the side of the carpet on your
own.

00:52:17.507 --> 00:52:18.323
LIAM: This is tense.

00:52:18.323 --> 00:52:18.968
LAURA: This is tense.

00:52:18.968 --> 00:52:20.852
MATT: You're having a hard time even seeing Grog
now.

00:52:20.852 --> 00:52:22.350
The world's just spinning and spinning and
spinning.

00:52:22.350 --> 00:52:23.142
LAURA: Oh God.

00:52:23.142 --> 00:52:23.923
TRAVIS: It's like Gravity.

00:52:23.923 --> 00:52:24.950
MATT: You can attempt--

00:52:24.950 --> 00:52:26.885
ORION: Now I'm going to cast Featherfall.

00:52:26.949 --> 00:52:32.255
MATT: Go ahead, cast and roll concentration
check. What did you roll?

00:52:32.255 --> 00:52:35.781
MARISHA: He rolled a 19. Which is good.

00:52:35.781 --> 00:52:40.718
MATT: Okay. Featherfall gets to you just in time.
Your descent slows.

00:52:40.718 --> 00:52:43.336
In that time, Grog has impacted.

00:52:43.336 --> 00:52:44.205
MARISHA: Fuck!

00:52:44.205 --> 00:52:45.275
LAURA: Oh no, Grog!

00:52:45.275 --> 00:52:46.316
LIAM: We're gonna hit, we're gonna hit. I'm
shielding the healer.

00:52:46.316 --> 00:52:48.073
LAURA: I'm shielding Scanlan.

00:52:48.073 --> 00:52:53.475
MATT: So you all brace for impact. The actual
carpet's careening out of control. You can see

00:52:53.475 --> 00:52:57.790
there's just barely the top of a building you
might be able to try and skim.

00:52:57.790 --> 00:52:59.997
LAURA: Can we jump onto the top of the building?

00:52:59.997 --> 00:53:02.510
MATT: This is going to be up to the one who's been
steering this whole time.

00:53:02.510 --> 00:53:05.278
Go ahead and make an intelligence check.

00:53:05.278 --> 00:53:06.135
LAURA: Intelligence!

00:53:06.135 --> 00:53:06.884
LIAM: Intelligence?

00:53:06.884 --> 00:53:07.530
MATT: Yes.

00:53:07.530 --> 00:53:08.577
ASHLEY: Can I assist?

00:53:08.577 --> 00:53:09.830
MATT: No.

00:53:10.029 --> 00:53:11.245
TRAVIS: Thank God it's not me.

00:53:11.245 --> 00:53:12.298
MARISHA: Can we do nothing and--

00:53:12.298 --> 00:53:14.333
LIAM: Good, good, good, good. 24.

00:53:14.333 --> 00:53:15.060
MATT: 24?

00:53:15.060 --> 00:53:16.082
LIAM: Yeah, so I'm pretty smart.

00:53:16.082 --> 00:53:19.613
MATT: You just managed to skim the edge, which
lessens your impact slightly, however, it does

00:53:19.613 --> 00:53:22.319
send you all into a full end-over-end topple.

00:53:22.319 --> 00:53:23.706
LIAM: Still holding a gnome!

00:53:23.706 --> 00:53:26.898
MATT: Everyone. &lt;i&gt;Everyone.&lt;/i&gt; Make an acrobatics
check.

00:53:26.898 --> 00:53:29.390
LAURA: Oh, god. Which one to roll, which one to
roll.

00:53:29.390 --> 00:53:31.183
MARISHA: Oh, no. What's going on with Grog?

00:53:31.183 --> 00:53:32.570
LIAM: I guess that's what we'll find out
afterwards.

00:53:32.570 --> 00:53:36.084
MATT: Grog's impacted. He was falling faster than
you guys were, he's six hundred pounds going into

00:53:36.084 --> 00:53:39.068
straight freefall. You guys had a little bit of a
fall break.

00:53:39.068 --> 00:53:42.115
MARISHA: Ah, this is going terribly! I'm failing!

00:53:42.115 --> 00:53:45.384
ORION: Do I have to do one also?

00:53:45.384 --> 00:53:47.495
MATT: Everyone. Oh, except for you, because you're
floating.

00:53:47.495 --> 00:53:51.703
LIAM: Do the halflings-- Shit! Do the gnomes get
an advantage

00:53:51.703 --> 00:53:55.246
since the half-elves are protecting them?

00:53:55.246 --> 00:53:56.530
LAURA: Depending on how we roll?

00:53:56.530 --> 00:53:59.230
MATT: It's based on how you guys roll, because
you're the ones who are holding onto them.

00:53:59.230 --> 00:54:00.682
LIAM: Oh, okay.

00:54:00.897 --> 00:54:03.344
LAURA: Welp, Scanlan. I'm sorry to let you know--

00:54:03.344 --> 00:54:04.070
TALIESIN: No.

00:54:04.070 --> 00:54:05.195
LIAM: Oh no!

00:54:05.195 --> 00:54:06.362
MATT: So you got Pike?

00:54:06.362 --> 00:54:07.236
LIAM: Yeah, I got Pike.

00:54:07.236 --> 00:54:08.511
MATT: What'd you roll?

00:54:08.511 --> 00:54:09.783
LIAM: 18.

00:54:09.783 --> 00:54:12.554
MATT: Natural one.

00:54:12.554 --> 00:54:13.570
ASHLEY: 13.

00:54:13.570 --> 00:54:14.468
TRAVIS: 18.

00:54:14.468 --> 00:54:15.964
TALIESIN: 23.

00:54:15.964 --> 00:54:17.593
MARISHA: Four.

00:54:17.593 --> 00:54:19.639
MATT: Okay, so half-damage for you.

00:54:19.639 --> 00:54:22.292
LAURA: But I have a plus nine acrobatics! Plus
nine acrobatics!

00:54:22.292 --> 00:54:23.061
LIAM: Doesn't matter.

00:54:23.061 --> 00:54:24.641
LAURA: Doesn't matter on a natural crit fail.

00:54:24.641 --> 00:54:25.829
TALIESIN: Still gonna knock me out.

00:54:25.829 --> 00:54:28.138
MATT: Roll some fall damage here.

00:54:28.138 --> 00:54:29.583
LAURA: I'm sorry, Scanlan!

00:54:29.583 --> 00:54:31.326
LIAM: It's all right, I got the healer, I got the
healer.

00:54:31.326 --> 00:54:32.353
MARISHA: It's not gonna be good.

00:54:32.353 --> 00:54:33.610
TRAVIS: You're gonna be like an ACME cartoon and
just leave a (pff)

00:54:33.610 --> 00:54:34.478
LAURA and LIAM: (pff)

00:54:34.478 --> 00:54:35.321
MATT: 18 points of damage.

00:54:35.321 --> 00:54:36.058
TALIESIN: I'm out.

00:54:36.058 --> 00:54:36.728
MARISHA: You're out again?

00:54:36.728 --> 00:54:37.865
LAURA: You're unconscious again?

00:54:37.865 --> 00:54:38.472
TALIESIN: Yeah.

00:54:38.472 --> 00:54:40.541
MATT: He didn't have a lot of hit points left.

00:54:40.541 --> 00:54:41.324
LAURA: Oh no, we're all dead!

00:54:41.324 --> 00:54:42.532
MARISHA: This the second time Grog's almost fallen
to his death.

00:54:42.532 --> 00:54:44.902
MATT: 18 points of damage to you. The rest of you
all take 36 points of fall damage,

00:54:44.902 --> 00:54:46.026
except for Grog.

00:54:46.026 --> 00:54:46.983
LIAM: Everybody, everybody?

00:54:46.983 --> 00:54:49.719
LAURA: Everybody? As a group, like we all failed
as a group?

00:54:49.719 --> 00:54:52.096
MATT: Well, no, no, sorry. You succeeded, you rolled a--

00:54:52.172 --> 00:54:53.278
LIAM: 18.

00:54:53.278 --> 00:54:58.906
MATT: 18, so you would also take half-damage, so 
you would take 18 as well.

00:54:59.063 --> 00:55:00.014
ASHLEY: I take--

00:55:00.097 --> 00:55:01.848
MATT: You take half that as well, thanks to his
roll as well.

00:55:01.913 --> 00:55:03.286
TRAVIS: I rolled an 18.

00:55:03.369 --> 00:55:05.021
ASHLEY: Everybody in this club getting hit
points.

00:55:05.021 --> 00:55:06.493
MATT: Right, you were in full plummet, you can
reduce the damage slightly.

00:55:06.493 --> 00:55:08.110
TRAVIS: Well, I was very graceful on the way
down.

00:55:08.110 --> 00:55:10.747
MATT: Yeah, you take 45 points of damage from the
impact, Grog.

00:55:10.747 --> 00:55:11.556
MARISHA: 45?

00:55:11.556 --> 00:55:12.548
MATT: 45 points of damage.

00:55:12.548 --> 00:55:13.852
MARISHA: Oh.

00:55:13.852 --> 00:55:14.946
LIAM: It was halved, so eight.

00:55:14.946 --> 00:55:16.050
MATT: And leave a small crater from the impact.

00:55:16.050 --> 00:55:16.724
TRAVIS: Thank you.

00:55:16.724 --> 00:55:17.883
MARISHA: You know what, that could've been worse.

00:55:17.883 --> 00:55:19.003
LAURA: And I take 35?

00:55:19.003 --> 00:55:20.794
MATT: You and Scanlan both take 36, which puts
Scanlan into a negative as well, because he

00:55:20.794 --> 00:55:22.334
wasn't-- he was not at--

00:55:22.334 --> 00:55:23.736
LAURA: No, no! He was fully healed.

00:55:23.736 --> 00:55:24.337
TRAVIS: Nope.

00:55:24.337 --> 00:55:25.202
MATT: No, he wasn't.

00:55:25.202 --> 00:55:26.409
LAURA: (Softly) Fuck.

00:55:26.409 --> 00:55:27.729
LIAM: No, sorry, no.

00:55:27.729 --> 00:55:30.362
MATT: So, you all tumble end over end, come to
rest.

00:55:30.362 --> 00:55:32.257
MARISHA: We just crash-landed in a war camp.

00:55:32.257 --> 00:55:33.830
MATT: Yeah. On the far end of it, thankfully.

00:55:33.830 --> 00:55:35.230
MARISHA: Oh boy.

00:55:35.230 --> 00:55:38.114
MATT: You guys can hear the bells and the horns
going in the distance. It looks like all the rest

00:55:38.114 --> 00:55:41.992
of the folks that were stationed here moved
towards the center. You managed to arc over them,

00:55:41.992 --> 00:55:43.898
but they're going to be here shortly.

00:55:43.898 --> 00:55:45.549
TRAVIS: Are we near their big war machines?

00:55:45.549 --> 00:55:48.372
MATT: No, the ballistae are on the opposite--

00:55:48.372 --> 00:55:52.327
ORION: So we can see the ledge and that cavern
where we were, where we found the--

00:55:52.327 --> 00:55:55.158
MATT: Well, the ledge is back in the other
direction. You guys are going towards the tunnel

00:55:55.158 --> 00:55:56.849
on the opposite side.

00:55:56.849 --> 00:56:00.627
LIAM: Vax is pulling up Pike onto her feet and
dragging her towards Scanlan, 'cause I know how

00:56:00.627 --> 00:56:02.664
fucked up he was from the last battle.

00:56:02.664 --> 00:56:04.119
ASHLEY: Where's Scanlan? How close--

00:56:04.119 --> 00:56:06.170
MATT: Okay, you guys-- and you, you're kinda
getting up on your knees, coughing--

00:56:06.170 --> 00:56:07.267
MARISHA: How, how--

00:56:07.267 --> 00:56:08.525
ASHLEY: Percy's out, let's go--

00:56:08.525 --> 00:56:09.626
LIAM: But so is Scanlan.

00:56:09.626 --> 00:56:11.027
MATT: Percy's just face-down in the ground,
scrapes across the side of his face.

00:56:11.027 --> 00:56:11.930
ASHLEY: Scanlan's out, too? Fuck.

00:56:11.930 --> 00:56:12.904
LIAM: Scanlan's out, too, right?

00:56:12.904 --> 00:56:14.106
MATT: Scanlan's also out.

00:56:14.106 --> 00:56:15.345
TRAVIS: How about-- I'll give him a level three
potion and you go heal Scanlan.

00:56:15.407 --> 00:56:16.623
LAURA: No, you, here, you take care of him, I'm
right next to Scanlan,

00:56:16.623 --> 00:56:21.175
MATT: You guys are roughly about ten feet from
each other from the impact, just, you were

00:56:21.258 --> 00:56:23.553
scattered, and then you kind of regrouped.

00:56:23.617 --> 00:56:25.734
MARISHA: Okay. Can we see people running towards
us?

00:56:25.905 --> 00:56:27.810
MATT: Not yet, but you assume it's only a short
period of time.

00:56:27.894 --> 00:56:29.307
ORION: Yeah, yeah, we have some time left--

00:56:29.487 --> 00:56:30.465
MARISHA: We don't, I don't know.

00:56:30.672 --> 00:56:34.421
MATT: Grog, what you at?

00:56:34.421 --> 00:56:36.014
TRAVIS: 39.

00:56:36.014 --> 00:56:36.801
MATT: Okay.

00:56:36.801 --> 00:56:37.685
TRAVIS: She's doing a Mass Healing--

00:56:37.685 --> 00:56:38.589
ASHLEY: A Mass Healing Word.

00:56:38.589 --> 00:56:41.262
MATT: Okay. You barely get yourself out of the
crater. That's gonna suck tomorrow!

00:56:41.262 --> 00:56:42.031
MARISHA: Mass Healing Word?

00:56:42.031 --> 00:56:43.181
LIAM: You take Scanlan, I'll take Percy.

00:56:43.181 --> 00:56:43.922
LAURA: Okay! I'm gonna--

00:56:43.922 --> 00:56:44.841
LIAM: Healing potions out.

00:56:44.841 --> 00:56:48.424
MATT: As this is happening, Percy, go ahead and
make a death saving throw.

00:56:48.424 --> 00:56:49.378
LAURA: Oh!

00:56:49.378 --> 00:56:50.468
TRAVIS: A death saving throw?

00:56:50.468 --> 00:56:51.229
LIAM: Sorry, here's three--

00:56:51.229 --> 00:56:52.590
TALIESIN: Is that-- Is that just--

00:56:52.590 --> 00:56:53.341
MATT: What did you roll?

00:56:53.341 --> 00:56:54.231
TALIESIN: A nine.

00:56:54.231 --> 00:56:55.857
MATT: That's a fail, so mark off one fail on your
death saving throw on your sheet.

00:56:55.857 --> 00:56:56.864
LAURA: (gasps)

00:56:56.864 --> 00:56:57.932
ASHLEY and LAURA: No no no no!

00:56:57.932 --> 00:56:58.683
TRAVIS: Oh shit!

00:56:58.683 --> 00:56:59.678
LIAM: Sorry I'm late, Percy.

00:56:59.678 --> 00:57:00.614
MATT: Scanlan does make his.

00:57:00.614 --> 00:57:01.568
LIAM: He's all right, he's all right, he's all
right.

00:57:01.568 --> 00:57:03.313
I've got a healing potion and I'm pouring it--

00:57:03.313 --> 00:57:04.196
ASHLEY: But I'm doing--

00:57:04.196 --> 00:57:06.161
LIAM: I'm pinching Percy's nose and pouring it in
his mouth.

00:57:06.161 --> 00:57:08.112
LAURA: And I'm pouring some down Scanlan's
throat.

00:57:08.112 --> 00:57:12.626
MATT: Okay, all right. So both you guys pour
healing potions. That is-- those are the normal

00:57:12.626 --> 00:57:14.400
ones? The common? The regular healing?

00:57:14.400 --> 00:57:15.213
LIAM: I think so.

00:57:15.213 --> 00:57:15.843
LAURA: Yeah?

00:57:15.843 --> 00:57:17.136
MATT: 2d4 + 2. Go ahead and roll that.

00:57:17.136 --> 00:57:18.114
LIAM: (whispers) 2d4 + 2.

00:57:18.114 --> 00:57:19.509
TRAVIS: I'm taking a level two potion, myself.
Just--

00:57:19.509 --> 00:57:20.466
TALIESIN: 2d4 + 2?

00:57:20.466 --> 00:57:21.342
MATT: Okay, go for it.

00:57:21.342 --> 00:57:22.575
LIAM: Eight. Eight for Percy.

00:57:22.575 --> 00:57:24.837
MATT: That's four--

00:57:24.837 --> 00:57:26.004
TALIESIN: Oh! So I'm at plus eight now?

00:57:26.004 --> 00:57:26.907
MATT and LIAM: Yes.

00:57:26.907 --> 00:57:27.781
LIAM: You're up.

00:57:27.781 --> 00:57:28.537
MATT: Scanlan also comes to consciousness.

00:57:28.537 --> 00:57:29.870
LAURA: 2d4? That's pathetic.

00:57:29.870 --> 00:57:32.278
MATT: That's the cheapest one you've got. 2d4 +
2.

00:57:32.278 --> 00:57:33.838
LIAM: Let's get the fuck out of here and they
can--

00:57:33.838 --> 00:57:34.930
LAURA: Okay, fine.

00:57:34.930 --> 00:57:35.810
TALIESIN: She was gonna do a Mass Healing--

00:57:35.810 --> 00:57:37.019
MARISHA: Yeah, what's your Mass Healing Word?

00:57:37.019 --> 00:57:43.020
ORION: I'd like to know-- on the way down, I was
doing a little chant and I was expending my

00:57:43.020 --> 00:57:47.169
sorcery points to do Flexible Casting, so I regain
a slot spell on my third-level spells.

00:57:47.280 --> 00:57:48.521
MATT: Okay.

00:57:48.521 --> 00:57:53.564
LAURA: As we're getting up, can I see-- Is the
camp nearby, where the prisoners are?

00:57:53.564 --> 00:57:55.198
Is that anywhere near us?

00:57:55.198 --> 00:57:56.806
MATT: No, that's towards the center of the camp.

00:57:56.806 --> 00:58:00.635
LIAM: We gotta keep moving. I pull out another
corked potion and slap it into Percy's hand.

00:58:00.635 --> 00:58:01.627
MARISHA: Yeah, we gotta go.

00:58:01.627 --> 00:58:03.381
LIAM: And then grab him by the wrist and just
start walking.

00:58:03.381 --> 00:58:04.245
TALIESIN: I'm up.

00:58:04.245 --> 00:58:06.609
MARISHA: Here, wait. Save the potion, I cast
Healing Word on Percy.

00:58:06.609 --> 00:58:08.575
ASHLEY: Hold on, I'm gonna do a Mass Cure Wounds.

00:58:08.575 --> 00:58:09.473
LAURA: Mass Cure Wounds?

00:58:09.473 --> 00:58:12.335
MATT: All right. So as you guys are running
towards the back, towards the main tunnel, which

00:58:12.335 --> 00:58:17.809
you can now see, it's roughly a 40- by 30-foot
tunnel. You go running through the buildings. You

00:58:17.809 --> 00:58:19.603
see a few duergar kinda poke out from the
buildings.

00:58:19.603 --> 00:58:21.516
LAURA: Can we stealth while we're doing this, or
are we too, like, injured?

00:58:21.516 --> 00:58:22.363
ORION: No, this is--

00:58:22.363 --> 00:58:23.714
MATT: No, you guys are just bolting at this point.
You're not even

00:58:23.714 --> 00:58:24.857
concentrating on stealth right now.

00:58:24.857 --> 00:58:25.733
LAURA: Bolting it, right.

00:58:25.733 --> 00:58:26.579
TALIESIN: This is, this is--

00:58:26.579 --> 00:58:28.978
MATT: Plus, with the group-- Basically, a few of
you would stealth and the rest of you would be

00:58:28.978 --> 00:58:30.803
left in the dust, so you're just kind of all
pushing for speed at this point.

00:58:30.803 --> 00:58:31.599
LAURA: Okay.

00:58:31.599 --> 00:58:32.110
ORION: Yeah.

00:58:32.110 --> 00:58:36.737
MATT: You all manage to push towards the back of
the entire war camp, into this tunnel. Hearing

00:58:36.737 --> 00:58:42.375
behind you the distant echoing shouts of
approximately 30-plus duergar heading in your

00:58:42.375 --> 00:58:49.662
direction. You hear a few other ballista bolts
hitting the wall above you of the stone.

00:58:49.749 --> 00:58:50.999
ORION: Are we all in the tunnel?

00:58:50.999 --> 00:58:52.520
MATT: You guys have now pushed into the tunnel.

00:58:52.520 --> 00:58:55.178
ORION: I wait for everybody to pass and I cast all
my Grand Columns.

00:58:55.178 --> 00:58:57.656
MATT: Okay, how many can you--

00:58:57.656 --> 00:58:58.452
ORION: Three.

00:58:58.452 --> 00:59:00.962
MATT: Three per spell? And how many spell levels
do you have currently?

00:59:00.962 --> 00:59:03.664
ORION: That's it, that's what I did the SP for, so
that I could cast this right now.

00:59:03.664 --> 00:59:04.783
MATT: Right. So you have one.

00:59:04.783 --> 00:59:05.923
ORION: I have none in my column.

00:59:05.923 --> 00:59:08.113
MATT: Right. How many spell castings did you have
left? Two?

00:59:08.113 --> 00:59:09.336
ORION: No, I had one.

00:59:09.336 --> 00:59:10.328
ASHLEY: (whispers) 24.

00:59:10.328 --> 00:59:11.030
TALIESIN: 24?

00:59:11.030 --> 00:59:11.806
LAURA: 24 mass?

00:59:11.806 --> 00:59:12.862
ASHLEY: 24 mass cure.

00:59:12.862 --> 00:59:13.955
MATT: One left. So you get three columns. It's 30
feet wide.

00:59:13.955 --> 00:59:15.484
LAURA: Oh, she just healed everybody for 24
points.

00:59:15.484 --> 00:59:16.122
ORION: (whispers) Oh, it's 30--

00:59:16.122 --> 00:59:17.002
MARISHA: Oh, dope.

00:59:17.002 --> 00:59:18.165
MATT: Okay, everyone heals for 24 points. Add that
up.

00:59:18.165 --> 00:59:18.999
LIAM: Oh, I feel good!

00:59:18.999 --> 00:59:20.036
LAURA: I feel pretty good now.

00:59:20.036 --> 00:59:20.990
TRAVIS: Dude! Kick that shit.

00:59:20.990 --> 00:59:21.920
LAURA: What what!

00:59:21.920 --> 00:59:22.899
ORION: It's not enough, is it?

00:59:22.899 --> 00:59:23.676
MATT: No.

00:59:23.676 --> 00:59:24.571
ASHLEY: (sighs) Okay. Including myself?

00:59:24.571 --> 00:59:25.384
LIAM and TRAVIS: Yes.

00:59:25.384 --> 00:59:26.999
ORION: Are the caves stone? Like the cave--

00:59:26.999 --> 00:59:28.004
MATT: The walls are stone.

00:59:28.004 --> 00:59:28.651
TRAVIS: Ugh, that's huge.

00:59:28.651 --> 00:59:29.835
LAURA: Oh my god, it's major.

00:59:29.835 --> 00:59:31.839
ORION: Can I like, do it from the side? Can I
attempt to?

00:59:31.839 --> 00:59:33.652
MATT: Pillars go straight up, unfortunately. It's
the nature of the spell's creation.

00:59:33.652 --> 00:59:35.341
MARISHA: Well wait, I can do what you're trying to
do.

00:59:35.341 --> 00:59:36.143
ORION: Oh! Oh yeah!

00:59:36.143 --> 00:59:37.143
MARISHA: I do Wall Of Stone.

00:59:37.143 --> 00:59:38.029
ORION: There you go!

00:59:38.029 --> 00:59:40.115
MATT: Okay! So as you're trying to figure this
out, Keyleth steps over--

00:59:40.115 --> 00:59:41.650
MARISHA: I'm like, oh, is this, oh--

00:59:41.650 --> 00:59:43.578
ORION: It's-- Oh!

00:59:43.578 --> 00:59:47.124
MARISHA: Sorry! You should've just-- I would've--
they're not very--

00:59:47.124 --> 00:59:48.139
ORION: They're columns.

00:59:48.139 --> 00:59:49.022
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:59:49.022 --> 00:59:50.449
ORION: You're good. The wall's good.

00:59:50.449 --> 00:59:51.281
MARISHA: Right.

00:59:51.281 --> 00:59:51.993
ORION: Good.

00:59:51.993 --> 00:59:53.591
LAURA: Are we running? I don't know what you guys
are doing. What's happening right now?

00:59:53.591 --> 00:59:56.779
MATT: As you guys are doing this and rushing in,
you're realizing there's one member of your party

00:59:56.779 --> 00:59:59.718
that you haven't had a lot of time with--

00:59:59.718 --> 01:00:00.544
LAURA and LIAM: Clarota!

01:00:00.544 --> 01:00:01.693
MATT: -- that you didn't think about until this
moment.

01:00:01.693 --> 01:00:02.761
LIAM: Clarota, yeah. Clarota.

01:00:02.761 --> 01:00:03.759
MARISHA: Oh, yeah!

01:00:03.759 --> 01:00:09.362
MATT: You now see, kind of, like, floating, via
levitation ability, about 30 feet away, slowly

01:00:09.362 --> 01:00:12.073
descending towards you, as you're putting up the
wall of stone--

01:00:12.073 --> 01:00:13.051
ORION: Oh! Wait! Hold on!

01:00:13.051 --> 01:00:15.145
TRAVIS: Come on Squidworth, over here!

01:00:15.222 --> 01:00:21.917
MATT: Two bolts go firing towards him; one
whooshes overhead, a second one--

01:00:21.917 --> 01:00:22.839
MARISHA: Clarota!

01:00:22.839 --> 01:00:25.518
MATT: (impact sound) -- through his back, out the
front of his chest--

01:00:25.518 --> 01:00:26.358
LAURA: No!

01:00:26.358 --> 01:00:27.547
MATT: -- off the shoulder.

01:00:27.547 --> 01:00:30.283
ORION: Come on! We need to save him!

01:00:30.283 --> 01:00:31.861
LIAM: He's gotta have more than ten hit points.

01:00:31.861 --> 01:00:33.162
ORION: Recess the wall, recess the wall!

01:00:33.162 --> 01:00:33.992
MARISHA: Wait!

01:00:33.992 --> 01:00:39.309
MATT: You can see now-- and the bolt itself is
about 4 feet long, made of this long, jagged,

01:00:39.309 --> 01:00:40.798
pointed arrow tip.

01:00:40.798 --> 01:00:41.728
LAURA: Oh, man.

01:00:41.728 --> 01:00:44.862
MATT: Clarota begins to falter, and begins to
hover towards you, almost, like, trying to swim

01:00:44.862 --> 01:00:46.334
through the air in your direction.

01:00:46.334 --> 01:00:47.308
LAURA: Can we run out, try to grab him?

01:00:47.308 --> 01:00:48.290
ASHLEY: Can I grab him, hang on to him?

01:00:48.290 --> 01:00:49.273
ORION: Oh!

01:00:49.273 --> 01:00:51.994
MATT: He's about 20 feet from you now, you can try
and reach out and put your hands towards him--

01:00:51.994 --> 01:00:52.612
ORION: Boom!

01:00:52.612 --> 01:00:53.460
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:00:53.460 --> 01:00:54.258
TRAVIS: I take off and run to him.

01:00:54.258 --> 01:00:58.804
ORION: Now I cast Glacial Blast, right under him,
like a slide, right towards us-- and catch him.

01:00:58.804 --> 01:01:01.222
MATT: Okay. So as you guys are running towards
him, instead,

01:01:01.222 --> 01:01:03.199
this giant crystalline form of ice just--

01:01:03.199 --> 01:01:04.473
LAURA: Oh, all right.

01:01:04.473 --> 01:01:07.379
MATT: -- crackles up into what looks like some
sort of strange, winter festival slide that would

01:01:07.379 --> 01:01:09.724
be made for children in the center of town.
Clarota--

01:01:09.724 --> 01:01:10.721
ASHLEY: Awesome.

01:01:10.721 --> 01:01:16.661
MATT: -- as it descends, two more bolts come
towards him. Both (whoosh, whoosh). At this

01:01:16.661 --> 01:01:19.624
distance, in the darkness of the cavern, it's kind
of hard for them to get a bead on him. Both just

01:01:19.624 --> 01:01:25.018
pass overhead. With eyes kind of lolling, Clarota
comes down and hits the edge of the slide, and

01:01:25.018 --> 01:01:28.518
almost loses consciousness at that moment, sliding
through the ice. You guys manage to capture,

01:01:28.518 --> 01:01:30.815
grappling his arms, lift him to his feet--

01:01:30.815 --> 01:01:34.317
MARISHA: And now, Wall Of Stone.

01:01:34.317 --> 01:01:37.178
MATT: You all make it into the tunnel, Keyleth
turns around, raising her hands, the actual

01:01:37.178 --> 01:01:42.723
blackened stonework of this tunnel shakes for a
second, and then a giant, thick wall of natural

01:01:42.723 --> 01:01:45.336
rock closes off the entire tunnel behind you.

01:01:45.336 --> 01:01:46.772
ORION: Nice.

01:01:46.772 --> 01:01:47.940
LAURA: I love you, Trinket!

01:01:47.940 --> 01:01:49.021
LIAM: Completely seals it?

01:01:49.021 --> 01:01:49.972
MARISHA: Oh, gosh.

01:01:49.972 --> 01:01:52.030
MATT: Completely seals it. You guys are now in
complete darkness.

01:01:52.030 --> 01:01:54.076
ORION: Ooh! Light!

01:01:54.076 --> 01:02:00.529
MATT: As the light hits, you can hear, just on the
other side of the surface of the stone wall,

01:02:00.529 --> 01:02:04.691
javelins, other things are being shot at the stone
wall--

01:02:04.691 --> 01:02:05.407
LAURA: Yeah!

01:02:05.407 --> 01:02:09.075
MATT: -- but it's keeping it at bay. You guys are
now at the wall, and behind you the tunnel

01:02:09.075 --> 01:02:11.326
continues into a passage you haven't seen yet.

01:02:11.326 --> 01:02:14.744
TRAVIS: Whatever we do from here, I sprinkle dust
of tracelessness behind us

01:02:14.744 --> 01:02:17.177
the whole time like a fucking flower girl.

01:02:17.177 --> 01:02:19.296
(all laugh)

01:02:19.296 --> 01:02:23.025
LIAM: They could have magic in their possession,
they could use magic as well, so let's move.

01:02:23.025 --> 01:02:23.890
LAURA: Yeah, they could get through it.

01:02:23.890 --> 01:02:24.650
ORION: Yes.

01:02:24.650 --> 01:02:25.448
TALIESIN: Will a healing potion work on Clarota?

01:02:25.448 --> 01:02:26.522
ASHLEY: So, Clarota's with us?

01:02:26.522 --> 01:02:27.164
LAURA: Clarota's with us.

01:02:27.164 --> 01:02:29.514
ASHLEY: Can I go over to Clarota and try to heal
him?

01:02:29.514 --> 01:02:30.958
LAURA: Don't get too close, he might just suck in
your brain.

01:02:30.958 --> 01:02:31.774
MATT: You can certainly try.

01:02:31.774 --> 01:02:32.644
TALIESIN: I've got a potion, so--

01:02:32.644 --> 01:02:33.337
MARISHA: Grog?

01:02:33.337 --> 01:02:34.224
ASHLEY: Should we give him a potion?

01:02:34.224 --> 01:02:34.946
TRAVIS: What?

01:02:34.946 --> 01:02:36.524
MARISHA: Do you have any ale?

01:02:36.524 --> 01:02:39.558
TRAVIS: Yeah, I do have a cask, actually.

01:02:39.558 --> 01:02:40.809
MARISHA: I think I need a drink.

01:02:40.809 --> 01:02:42.529
TRAVIS: Right. I'll--

01:02:42.529 --> 01:02:44.543
TALIESIN: What's a level two potion do?

01:02:44.543 --> 01:02:45.191
TRAVIS: There you are.

01:02:45.191 --> 01:02:48.202
MATT: A level two potion would be 4d4 + 4.

01:02:48.202 --> 01:02:49.623
TRAVIS: I go and hold his shoulders--

01:02:49.623 --> 01:02:50.542
MARISHA: I really need a drink.

01:02:50.542 --> 01:02:53.701
TRAVIS: -- whilst she tries to heal him, just in
case he gets all sucky on her.

01:02:53.701 --> 01:02:55.390
ASHLEY: I think he's gonna give him a potion.

01:02:55.390 --> 01:02:56.033
TRAVIS: Oh.

01:02:56.033 --> 01:02:56.732
TALIESIN: I am.

01:02:56.732 --> 01:02:57.593
TRAVIS: That's much less--

01:02:57.593 --> 01:02:58.505
LAURA: No!

01:02:58.505 --> 01:03:00.392
LIAM: Felicia Day, that's not nice!

01:03:00.392 --> 01:03:02.604
TRAVIS: Hey!

01:03:02.604 --> 01:03:03.991
TALIESIN: 17 points of healing.

01:03:03.991 --> 01:03:05.724
MATT: Okay. 17 points to Clarota.

01:03:05.724 --> 01:03:07.548
ASHLEY: What'd she say?

01:03:07.548 --> 01:03:11.031
MATT: Which-- administering a potion to a mind
flayer is an experience that very few in this

01:03:11.031 --> 01:03:15.798
world have probably ever, or ever will,
experience. As you kind of reach over, grab his

01:03:15.798 --> 01:03:19.310
shoulder, you look for where to put it, and the
tendrils kind of, like, flail about, but begin

01:03:19.310 --> 01:03:24.313
to-- they, as he notices what you're doing, kind
of relax and open up, and you can now see the

01:03:24.313 --> 01:03:29.218
circular, lamprey-like, toothy maw of the mind
flayer. It's a very disturbing, disgusting image,

01:03:29.218 --> 01:03:37.146
with this jagged, yellow teeth, in a circular
form. You pop the cork, and just pour it in. As

01:03:37.146 --> 01:03:41.390
you do, you see the wounds across Clarota's form
begin to seal.

01:03:41.390 --> 01:03:45.385
The arrow is still stuck in its torso.

01:03:45.385 --> 01:03:46.621
LAURA: Can we try to pull it out?

01:03:46.621 --> 01:03:47.849
ASHLEY: Try to break off the part--

01:03:47.849 --> 01:03:48.646
MATT: You can certainly try.

01:03:48.646 --> 01:03:50.285
TRAVIS: I got it (snap)!

01:03:50.285 --> 01:03:53.774
MATT: Go ahead and make a-- this would be a
medicine check.

01:03:53.774 --> 01:03:55.251
LAURA: Do you wanna do that, Grog?

01:03:55.251 --> 01:03:57.348
TRAVIS: I'll do the breaking part.

01:03:57.348 --> 01:03:59.029
MATT: It's iron. It's solid iron.

01:03:59.029 --> 01:03:59.882
ASHLEY: My medicine's a four.

01:03:59.882 --> 01:04:00.821
LAURA: Oh.

01:04:00.821 --> 01:04:01.643
MATT: Breaking it off is not gonna work.

01:04:01.643 --> 01:04:02.834
ASHLEY: What's your medicine?

01:04:02.834 --> 01:04:03.728
TRAVIS: So? Zero.

01:04:03.728 --> 01:04:05.401
MATT: You have to pull it from the wound.

01:04:05.401 --> 01:04:05.849
ASHLEY: Okay. I'll try.

01:04:05.849 --> 01:04:06.797
TALIESIN: Who has a medicine?

01:04:06.797 --> 01:04:07.229
LAURA: So what are you--

01:04:07.229 --> 01:04:08.039
ASHLEY: A four.

01:04:08.039 --> 01:04:09.187
LAURA: Okay. All right.

01:04:09.187 --> 01:04:09.695
ASHLEY: What does everybody have?

01:04:09.695 --> 01:04:10.261
MATT: Go for it.

01:04:10.261 --> 01:04:10.727
LAURA: Do it!

01:04:10.727 --> 01:04:11.392
ASHLEY: Roll this guy? Okay. Nine?

01:04:11.392 --> 01:04:12.527
MATT: A nine.

01:04:12.527 --> 01:04:13.205
LAURA: (laughs) Oh no.

01:04:13.205 --> 01:04:13.885
ASHLEY: Sorry!

01:04:13.885 --> 01:04:16.530
MATT: So. You take your moment, you view up where
the puncture wound is, with a little bit of Grog's

01:04:16.530 --> 01:04:23.620
help, you both grab the edge, and you're like, 'On
three. One, two, three, pull!' You pull through

01:04:23.620 --> 01:04:25.340
the wound, not against the arrow--

01:04:25.340 --> 01:04:26.069
TRAVIS: Right.

01:04:26.069 --> 01:04:29.161
MATT: -- 'cause that would just tear everything
out in the process, but nevertheless, in doing so,

01:04:29.161 --> 01:04:31.822
Clarota does take an additional eight points of
damage.

01:04:31.822 --> 01:04:32.838
ASHLEY: I'm sorry.

01:04:32.838 --> 01:04:35.255
MATT: But, the wound is now no longer a giant--

01:04:35.255 --> 01:04:36.195
LAURA: Able to be healed.

01:04:36.195 --> 01:04:40.378
MATT: -- it's now able to be healed completely,
so. Clarota takes a moment

01:04:40.378 --> 01:04:42.794
and kind of grasps the wound.

01:04:42.794 --> 01:04:48.489
LAURA: I hand him a little healing potion, and
say, sorry.

01:04:48.489 --> 01:04:53.581
MATT: Shatters the glass. At which point, you now
hear (impact sounds) against the stone wall.

01:04:53.581 --> 01:04:54.313
LAURA: We should move!

01:04:54.313 --> 01:04:55.094
ASHLEY: Time to go!

01:04:55.094 --> 01:04:56.581
LIAM: Let's keep moving, yes? Yes.

01:04:56.581 --> 01:05:01.891
TRAVIS: I pick up Clarota. Yeah, why not.

01:05:01.891 --> 01:05:02.736
LAURA: Yeah, all right.

01:05:02.736 --> 01:05:04.856
TRAVIS: I pick up Clarota and we start running
balls.

01:05:04.856 --> 01:05:06.453
LAURA: Is he good enough to walk or is he--

01:05:06.453 --> 01:05:08.242
MATT: He's good enough to walk with you guys.
Well--

01:05:08.242 --> 01:05:11.797
TRAVIS: Well, how about I put one arm under his
face and help him.

01:05:11.797 --> 01:05:13.820
MATT: So you're helping him.

01:05:13.820 --> 01:05:18.022
LIAM: No, that's-- hold on a second. I take out
the flying carpet--

01:05:18.022 --> 01:05:19.099
LAURA: We still have the flying carpet?

01:05:19.099 --> 01:05:19.773
LIAM: Sure we do!

01:05:19.773 --> 01:05:20.357
MATT: Yeah.

01:05:20.357 --> 01:05:22.416
LIAM: Here, sit on this, Clarota.

01:05:22.416 --> 01:05:23.303
LAURA: If you need it.

01:05:23.303 --> 01:05:24.414
LIAM: That'd be easier, yes.

01:05:24.414 --> 01:05:28.892
MATT: Clarota gets up on the carpet and-- "Thank
you." The carpet kind of drifts alongside you

01:05:28.892 --> 01:05:34.306
guys. You guys are pushing backwards towards the
cavern. The tunnel kind of begins to pinch a

01:05:34.306 --> 01:05:38.307
little bit. It gets to about a 15-foot width
before it opens up again. You're about a hundred

01:05:38.307 --> 01:05:43.652
feet back. You can now see it opening into a--
what looks like an extension of the war camp.

01:05:43.652 --> 01:05:45.720
(all groan)

01:05:45.720 --> 01:05:48.988
LAURA: We should've gone down! What were we
thinking?

01:05:48.988 --> 01:05:50.658
MATT: Go ahead and make a perception check.

01:05:50.658 --> 01:05:51.914
LIAM: That guy was lying.

01:05:51.914 --> 01:05:54.237
LAURA: Well, he said go down. We didn't go down.

01:05:54.315 --> 01:05:57.760
LIAM: 21 for me.

01:05:57.760 --> 01:06:05.856
LAURA: 13 for me. I like how my passive perception
is way higher than any rolls that I ever do.

01:06:05.856 --> 01:06:07.953
MATT: I do keep that-- I keep tabs on that.

01:06:07.953 --> 01:06:09.083
TALIESIN: 22.

01:06:09.083 --> 01:06:10.205
MARISHA: Are we all doing perception rolls?

01:06:10.205 --> 01:06:13.362
MATT: For the most part, we've got a few rolls,
and it worked fine. Looking inside though, this

01:06:13.362 --> 01:06:15.639
camp looks like it's been abandoned.

01:06:15.639 --> 01:06:16.505
LAURA: Oh, good!

01:06:16.505 --> 01:06:19.535
MATT: It looks like it was built, and then the
expansion into the war camp you just escaped from

01:06:19.535 --> 01:06:23.839
seemed to be the next step. Like it's slowly
advancing and this section of it has been in

01:06:23.839 --> 01:06:29.529
disuse. As you push in towards the center of the
camp you can see there's older campfires, lots of

01:06:29.529 --> 01:06:33.984
the tents have like partially collapsed. Dust has
gathered.

01:06:33.984 --> 01:06:38.179
LIAM: I'm keeping my eyes peeled for useful shit.

01:06:38.179 --> 01:06:43.384
MATT: Okay. Looking around as well, you see all
the equipment. Any pieces that would be of

01:06:43.384 --> 01:06:48.168
interest have either been taken-- either destroyed
and are broken or have probably been moved into

01:06:48.168 --> 01:06:54.015
the war camp. You glance through a couple of the
tents. Looking about, it's definitely been

01:06:54.015 --> 01:06:59.905
abandoned. It no longer serves a purpose and
anything of use has been stripped and taken. This

01:06:59.905 --> 01:07:05.174
cavern is maybe about 60 feet up or so. It's a
little domed section, and you can now see there

01:07:05.174 --> 01:07:09.756
are two exit tunnels to this section. One that is
kind of straight ahead, a little bit to the left.

01:07:09.756 --> 01:07:13.863
And one that veers off to the direct left of you.
So if you're looking straight from the direction

01:07:13.863 --> 01:07:16.394
you came, there is one right ahead of you, a
little bit to the left

01:07:16.394 --> 01:07:18.278
and one that goes quickly to the left.

01:07:18.278 --> 01:07:19.597
LAURA: Should we take the left one?

01:07:19.597 --> 01:07:20.809
TRAVIS: Which one's the left one?

01:07:20.809 --> 01:07:21.721
MARISHA: He mentioned the left.

01:07:21.721 --> 01:07:23.279
LAURA: Yeah, so maybe we should stay left.

01:07:23.279 --> 01:07:24.056
MATT: Yeah, do that.

01:07:24.056 --> 01:07:27.035
LIAM: Clarota, do you know anything about these
passages?

01:07:27.035 --> 01:07:28.010
LAURA: Do you remember anything?

01:07:28.010 --> 01:07:30.116
MARISHA: Wait, why did he say that? Why did you
say that?

01:07:30.116 --> 01:07:36.767
MATT: 'Cause they're both kind of left. It's a
joke. Clarota takes a moment and kind of looks at

01:07:36.815 --> 01:07:45.219
you, kind of-- his breath. "I've not been this far
up these tunnels. It's too dangerous this close to

01:07:45.219 --> 01:07:49.789
"the war camp. I would've been killed in a
second."

01:07:49.789 --> 01:07:53.237
LAURA: What about the general's memory? Anything
there?

01:07:53.237 --> 01:07:59.840
MATT: He kind of closes his eyes for a second.
"One of these leads below, one of them leads to

01:07:59.840 --> 01:08:04.156
"the surface. I can't recall which."

01:08:04.156 --> 01:08:06.432
LAURA: Can we go up and--

01:08:06.432 --> 01:08:07.493
TRAVIS: Let's split up!

01:08:07.493 --> 01:08:10.425
LAURA: No, can we go next to the one on the far
left and see if I sense

01:08:10.425 --> 01:08:13.153
any like wind coming down, is there--

01:08:13.153 --> 01:08:17.198
MATT: Going to the one on the far left, as you're
stepping you hear a (muffled impact noise)--

01:08:17.198 --> 01:08:18.367
LAURA: Oh, well, good.

01:08:18.367 --> 01:08:20.535
MATT: -- against the distant stone wall that you
put up.

01:08:20.535 --> 01:08:22.019
TRAVIS: I think we get to pick one here.

01:08:22.019 --> 01:08:23.202
MARISHA: Are there any--

01:08:23.202 --> 01:08:24.802
ASHLEY: He did say go left.

01:08:24.802 --> 01:08:26.787
MATT: As you head to the tunnel, you don't sense
any sort of temperature change, but it does seem

01:08:26.787 --> 01:08:29.918
to steady off into a decline that curves to the
left.

01:08:29.918 --> 01:08:30.766
LAURA: We should do that.

01:08:30.766 --> 01:08:31.552
TALIESIN: Sounds good.

01:08:31.552 --> 01:08:34.493
MARISHA: Do you mean, are there like-- is there
any wildlife, any bats,

01:08:34.493 --> 01:08:37.726
any type of animals, anything like that?

01:08:37.726 --> 01:08:42.549
MATT: We shall say, a general sense of this area,
you look and you can see, in this area, unlike the

01:08:42.549 --> 01:08:46.273
previous sections, there are small clusters of
bats on the ceiling.

01:08:46.273 --> 01:08:47.112
MARISHA: Okay, I'm going to--

01:08:47.112 --> 01:08:50.077
MATT: As apparently they have an exit of some kind
to the surface.

01:08:50.077 --> 01:08:52.763
MARISHA: I'm going to go ahead and cast Beast
Sense on one of the bats.

01:08:52.763 --> 01:08:55.702
MATT: Okay.

01:08:55.702 --> 01:08:58.867
MARISHA: And I'm going to channel myself through
the bat and I'm going to

01:08:58.867 --> 01:09:03.715
make him fly down the far left tunnel.

01:09:03.715 --> 01:09:06.959
MATT: Okay. So as you guys are walking over there,
one of the bats--

01:09:06.959 --> 01:09:09.724
ASHLEY: Good call.

01:09:09.724 --> 01:09:15.516
MATT: -- heads down into the tunnel, continues
into the darkness.

01:09:15.516 --> 01:09:16.466
MARISHA: Can I just see--

01:09:16.466 --> 01:09:18.965
MATT: From the echolocation, which is a very
strange sensation, you haven't really done this

01:09:18.965 --> 01:09:22.722
before for a bat and it's a very weird experience.

01:09:22.722 --> 01:09:25.325
MARISHA: Wow, guys, this is really trippy.

01:09:25.325 --> 01:09:27.077
TALIESIN: We just hear (bat sounds).

01:09:27.077 --> 01:09:31.089
MATT: It continues about a steady 40-degree
decline that goes further and further down.

01:09:31.089 --> 01:09:32.728
LAURA: Keep going down. Down, down, down.

01:09:32.728 --> 01:09:37.905
MATT: Eventually, you get to a point where the bat
is out of your sphere of influence and you lose

01:09:37.905 --> 01:09:40.395
your connection to the bat.

01:09:40.395 --> 01:09:41.654
LAURA: Keep going down?

01:09:41.654 --> 01:09:48.495
MARISHA: Well, I didn't really see much, but
definitely there is a pretty steep incline. We

01:09:48.495 --> 01:09:50.091
could try it again and go down the other one.

01:09:50.091 --> 01:09:51.100
LIAM: This is a coin flip.

01:09:51.100 --> 01:09:52.575
LAURA: I think we keep going down. Just stick with
it.

01:09:52.575 --> 01:09:54.252
ORION: Hold on! Incline means up.

01:09:54.252 --> 01:09:55.151
LAURA: Oh.

01:09:55.151 --> 01:09:56.012
MATT: No, it's a decline.

01:09:56.012 --> 01:09:56.781
MARISHA: Decline.

01:09:56.781 --> 01:09:57.999
ORION: Decline means down.

01:09:57.999 --> 01:10:00.319
LAURA: Well, then let's go with the decline. Yes?

01:10:00.319 --> 01:10:01.857
TALIESIN: Yes.

01:10:01.857 --> 01:10:03.028
LAURA: Let's do it!

01:10:03.028 --> 01:10:05.108
TALIESIN: We go. With haste.

01:10:05.108 --> 01:10:05.928
LAURA: Yes.

01:10:05.928 --> 01:10:06.594
MATT: All righty.

01:10:06.594 --> 01:10:07.424
TRAVIS: With haste!

01:10:07.424 --> 01:10:09.273
LAURA: With stealth! With Dust of Tracelessness
behind us.

01:10:09.273 --> 01:10:10.522
TRAVIS: Hey, flower girl!

01:10:10.522 --> 01:10:12.060
LAURA: Flower girl!

01:10:12.060 --> 01:10:16.483
ORION: Actually, there's two tunnels, right?

01:10:16.483 --> 01:10:18.892
MATT: There are two tunnels, yes.

01:10:18.892 --> 01:10:20.182
ORION: And one's smaller than the other?

01:10:20.182 --> 01:10:22.604
MATT: Correct.

01:10:22.604 --> 01:10:24.563
ORION: Hm.

01:10:24.563 --> 01:10:25.524
MATT: Yes?

01:10:25.524 --> 01:10:26.819
TALIESIN: There's no right answer here. It's
just--

01:10:26.819 --> 01:10:28.472
ORION: I know.

01:10:28.472 --> 01:10:29.607
TALIESIN: Yeah.

01:10:29.607 --> 01:10:32.819
ORION: How big is the-- how wide is the smaller
one that we're going through?

01:10:32.819 --> 01:10:38.137
MATT: There's one, the one on the far end, the one
that does not appear to be a decline,

01:10:38.137 --> 01:10:43.191
seems to be the widest of the two.

01:10:43.191 --> 01:10:46.396
TRAVIS: I pull out a torch. Will you light my
torch?

01:10:46.396 --> 01:10:48.865
ORION: Yeah.

01:10:48.865 --> 01:10:50.093
TRAVIS: Nice.

01:10:50.093 --> 01:10:51.946
(all laugh)

01:10:51.946 --> 01:10:53.395
TRAVIS: Are we going to the left?

01:10:53.395 --> 01:10:53.915
LAURA: Yeah.

01:10:53.915 --> 01:10:55.245
TRAVIS: I take off running to the left.

01:10:55.245 --> 01:10:56.112
LAURA: Oh, god. Grog!

01:10:56.112 --> 01:10:56.784
MATT: Okay.

01:10:56.784 --> 01:10:57.383
LIAM: Running, running?

01:10:57.383 --> 01:10:58.003
TRAVIS: Running!

01:10:58.003 --> 01:10:58.597
LIAM: Really running?

01:10:58.597 --> 01:10:59.402
TRAVIS: Running to the left.

01:10:59.402 --> 01:11:00.425
ORION: Oh man, oh no!

01:11:00.425 --> 01:11:01.249
MATT: Grog goes charging into the darkened tunnel
to the very left--

01:11:01.249 --> 01:11:02.085
LAURA: Grog! Stop!

01:11:02.085 --> 01:11:03.473
ORION: Let's go, everybody!

01:11:03.473 --> 01:11:04.333
MARISHA: There he goes!

01:11:04.333 --> 01:11:05.155
LAURA: I'm gonna take off after him.

01:11:05.155 --> 01:11:08.567
MATT: The heavy footsteps of Grog disappearing
into the darkness--

01:11:08.567 --> 01:11:09.667
TRAVIS: (maniacal laugh)

01:11:09.667 --> 01:11:11.038
LAURA: We take off after him, 'cause he needs
help.

01:11:11.038 --> 01:11:11.899
ORION: Let's go!

01:11:11.899 --> 01:11:15.343
MARISHA: Grog, Grog! Don't run too far ahead--
He's gone.

01:11:15.343 --> 01:11:16.351
MATT: You guys give chase.

01:11:16.351 --> 01:11:17.033
LAURA: Yes.

01:11:17.033 --> 01:11:17.887
LIAM: It's like having Goofy as a party member.

01:11:17.887 --> 01:11:18.926
(all laugh)

01:11:18.926 --> 01:11:20.249
LIAM: (Goofy laugh)

01:11:20.249 --> 01:11:21.160
ASHLEY: Hodor!

01:11:21.160 --> 01:11:22.211
TRAVIS: Hah. Hodor.

01:11:22.211 --> 01:11:23.041
ASHLEY: Hodor.

01:11:23.041 --> 01:11:25.457
MATT: As you guys catch up to Grog, which isn't
too hard--

01:11:25.457 --> 01:11:26.445
TRAVIS: What? I'm fast.

01:11:26.445 --> 01:11:27.444
MATT: Are you going to a full sprint, though?

01:11:27.444 --> 01:11:30.279
TRAVIS: No, no, no. I mean. A leisurely jog.

01:11:30.279 --> 01:11:36.416
MATT: Right. You catch up to Grog. The tunnel
itself is about 30 feet wide, 20 feet tall. And it

01:11:36.416 --> 01:11:41.266
is a slow, continuously gradual decline and curve
to the left.

01:11:41.266 --> 01:11:42.477
LAURA: Can you do another wall?

01:11:42.477 --> 01:11:43.854
MATT: Like a spiral, downward.

01:11:43.854 --> 01:11:44.959
LAURA: No?

01:11:44.959 --> 01:11:49.837
TRAVIS: Maybe we could do a cave-in.

01:11:49.837 --> 01:11:51.342
LAURA: Well, that might be dangerous.

01:11:51.342 --> 01:11:53.385
TRAVIS: Yeah, but it'd be fun.

01:11:53.385 --> 01:11:59.312
MATT: You guys continue for another 20 or so
minutes down, before it opens up into a small

01:11:59.312 --> 01:12:07.830
alcove to the right, but the tunnel continues.
This alcove, it's about 35, 40 feet in, and it

01:12:07.830 --> 01:12:12.614
looks like there are remnants here of a camp that
was set up once. Similar to the war camp, but once

01:12:12.614 --> 01:12:14.742
again abandoned, or at least currently not in use.

01:12:14.742 --> 01:12:15.638
LIAM: Any useful shit?

01:12:15.638 --> 01:12:20.765
LAURA: Can we go, oh! Can we go in? We should
probably rest, heal up, get our spells back. Can

01:12:20.765 --> 01:12:26.049
you cast the illusion terrain and make it look
like there's no hole in the cavern here?

01:12:26.049 --> 01:12:31.337
MARISHA: No. I can't, today. I'm sorry.

01:12:31.337 --> 01:12:36.282
ORION: If this is where we're gonna be chilling, I
can seal off that tunnel still.

01:12:36.282 --> 01:12:39.537
LAURA: But we have to be able to get back out.

01:12:39.537 --> 01:12:41.411
ORION: Right.

01:12:41.411 --> 01:12:44.552
TRAVIS: Not necessarily.

01:12:44.552 --> 01:12:45.638
ASHLEY: If I--

01:12:45.638 --> 01:12:50.683
LIAM: No! If you seal off the passage, right, we
keep going down, and if that's a dead end-- it's

01:12:50.683 --> 01:12:55.706
probably not-- if it is, can't we rest and use the
same spell to open it up?

01:12:55.706 --> 01:12:56.762
ORION: No, it's permanent.

01:12:56.762 --> 01:12:57.587
LIAM: That sucks.

01:12:57.587 --> 01:12:59.360
ORION: But we would just have Grog hack away at it
for a while--

01:12:59.360 --> 01:13:00.369
TRAVIS: Thank you!

01:13:00.369 --> 01:13:02.325
ORION: It can be, you know, destroyed.

01:13:02.325 --> 01:13:05.108
TRAVIS: They do call me 'Grog the Locksmith.'

01:13:05.108 --> 01:13:05.925
ORION: Right!

01:13:05.925 --> 01:13:07.020
TRAVIS: They don't call me that.

01:13:07.020 --> 01:13:08.779
LAURA: Can we go in and look at the camp and see,
like, stealthily--

01:13:08.779 --> 01:13:09.537
MATT: Yeah!

01:13:09.537 --> 01:13:10.650
LAURA: -- check out what the camp is?

01:13:10.650 --> 01:13:12.916
MARISHA: I can make it really foggy.

01:13:12.916 --> 01:13:14.029
MATT: Go ahead and make an investigate check.

01:13:14.029 --> 01:13:14.816
MARISHA: I could do that.

01:13:14.816 --> 01:13:15.830
LIAM: Yes, we know that about you.

01:13:15.830 --> 01:13:16.960
TRAVIS: Oh, I can too!

01:13:16.960 --> 01:13:19.184
LIAM: What about in the game, though?

01:13:19.184 --> 01:13:20.385
MARISHA: I can make it look like a--

01:13:20.385 --> 01:13:21.374
LAURA: 20.

01:13:21.374 --> 01:13:22.175
MATT: All right.

01:13:22.175 --> 01:13:23.874
MARISHA: Well, that's a different story.

01:13:23.874 --> 01:13:27.968
MATT: As you guys are having this conversation,
Vex does a quick glance over, there are about four

01:13:27.968 --> 01:13:31.415
tents that are still set up, there appears to be a
small ring where a fire was set up, and you can

01:13:31.415 --> 01:13:32.566
see kind of bits of charcoal--

01:13:32.566 --> 01:13:33.555
TALIESIN: Yes!

01:13:33.555 --> 01:13:36.672
MATT: -- and bits of long, long, long forgotten
burnt meat, remnants, charcoal, and such there.

01:13:36.672 --> 01:13:37.816
TRAVIS: I have two firewood bundles.

01:13:37.816 --> 01:13:40.785
TALIESIN: I'm gonna look for a seal, to see if
there's a seal anywhere around.

01:13:40.785 --> 01:13:42.574
MATT: You do see, on one of the walls--

01:13:42.574 --> 01:13:43.315
TALIESIN: Bam!

01:13:43.315 --> 01:13:45.114
MATT: -- there is a similar seal of Bahamut.

01:13:45.114 --> 01:13:46.760
LAURA: (gasps) Oh! This was her camp!

01:13:46.760 --> 01:13:47.641
TALIESIN: Kima was here!

01:13:47.641 --> 01:13:48.558
LAURA: Kima was here!

01:13:48.558 --> 01:13:49.745
MARISHA: #kimawashere.

01:13:49.745 --> 01:13:51.065
MATT: However, there are four tents here--

01:13:51.065 --> 01:13:51.827
LAURA: Oh.

01:13:51.827 --> 01:13:52.365
ORION: Kima was here.

01:13:52.365 --> 01:13:55.680
MATT: Which means-- previously you saw just one,
from what you saw. There are four here.

01:13:55.680 --> 01:13:57.855
TRAVIS: She had babies.

01:13:57.855 --> 01:14:00.958
MATT: It's an interesting change to your
appearance. Means either been repurposed, or there

01:14:00.958 --> 01:14:04.339
were more people with her, or since then the tent,
the camp has been used

01:14:04.339 --> 01:14:08.381
by other individuals aside from her.

01:14:08.381 --> 01:14:09.563
TRAVIS: Oh.

01:14:09.563 --> 01:14:15.647
MATT: However, glancing through, you do notice
that there are a few discarded travel bags--

01:14:15.647 --> 01:14:17.871
LAURA: Mine! Mine! Mine!

01:14:17.871 --> 01:14:19.105
MARISHA: Ooh!

01:14:19.105 --> 01:14:24.460
MATT: -- carrying rope, grappling hooks, general
cluster of torches, about eight in total--

01:14:24.460 --> 01:14:26.351
LAURA: Okay, that's nice. Torch, torch, torch,
torch.

01:14:26.351 --> 01:14:27.995
TRAVIS: Thank you! Bag of holding, bag of
holding.

01:14:27.995 --> 01:14:31.718
MATT: And as you glance about you can see, in this
alcove, looking at the dirt itself, it looks like

01:14:31.718 --> 01:14:34.889
there was a serious struggle. You can start seeing
drag mark--

01:14:34.889 --> 01:14:39.607
LAURA: Can I use Tracking and see what happened,
like Prince Humperdink, please? Can do?

01:14:39.607 --> 01:14:41.822
MATT: Ah, well, this is part of your investigation
roll, essentially.

01:14:41.822 --> 01:14:43.245
LAURA: Okay, okay.

01:14:43.245 --> 01:14:45.959
MATT: Unless you want to track to where the tracks
went, that's a different story. That's--

01:14:45.959 --> 01:14:49.606
LAURA: Well, can I see who was attacked first?
Does it look like Kima was attacked, or she--

01:14:49.606 --> 01:14:52.948
MATT: It's hard to tell, you see some of the
footsteps, and some of the drag marks, while

01:14:52.948 --> 01:15:00.922
mostly worn over, elements do show some of the
fairer folk. The duergar have a very distinct

01:15:00.922 --> 01:15:08.501
footprint or size. You do see one that resembles
more of, like, gnomish or halfling origin. You see

01:15:08.501 --> 01:15:15.273
drag marks in the dirt, you see other individuals,
looks like there were chunks of rock that have

01:15:15.273 --> 01:15:18.665
been chopped off the side of the wall that look
fresh, where you can see the soot that has settled

01:15:18.665 --> 01:15:22.842
into this part of the cavern is no longer visible
where these scratch marks

01:15:22.842 --> 01:15:26.204
basically took off and exposed fresh rock.

01:15:26.204 --> 01:15:28.892
LAURA: The drag marks, do they lead outside of the
alcove and down?

01:15:28.892 --> 01:15:31.622
MATT: They do, and they lead down the tunnel
further.

01:15:31.622 --> 01:15:33.279
LAURA: Okay.

01:15:33.279 --> 01:15:35.279
TRAVIS: Let's go that way, or are we resting?

01:15:35.279 --> 01:15:36.190
LAURA: Do we need to rest? I mean--

01:15:36.190 --> 01:15:37.282
LIAM: I think we should rest.

01:15:37.282 --> 01:15:38.051
ORION: I need to rest.

01:15:38.051 --> 01:15:40.204
LAURA: -- I feel like we need to get our spells
back, otherwise we're just gonna get killed.

01:15:40.204 --> 01:15:40.788
ORION: Yes.

01:15:40.788 --> 01:15:42.111
MARISHA: Are we being chased right now?

01:15:42.111 --> 01:15:42.933
TALIESIN: Possibly.

01:15:42.933 --> 01:15:43.710
ORION: Possibly.

01:15:43.710 --> 01:15:45.082
MARISHA: Are people hot on our tail?

01:15:45.082 --> 01:15:45.848
ORION: Possibly.

01:15:45.848 --> 01:15:46.824
TALIESIN: We can rest in shifts.

01:15:46.824 --> 01:15:48.091
LAURA: Yeah. I guess that's the best thing to do.

01:15:48.091 --> 01:15:48.852
TRAVIS: I'll stay awake.

01:15:48.852 --> 01:15:51.061
LIAM: I'm totally fine at the moment, so I'll stay
awake too.

01:15:51.061 --> 01:15:53.645
ORION: Should I seal the tunnel?

01:15:53.645 --> 01:15:54.636
MARISHA: I need to sleep.

01:15:54.636 --> 01:15:56.459
LAURA: Maybe seal the tunnel behind us, yeah, so
that--

01:15:56.459 --> 01:15:57.149
LIAM: Yes.

01:15:57.149 --> 01:15:58.528
LAURA: -- if they do come, they have to like, try
to get through.

01:15:58.528 --> 01:16:00.118
ASHLEY: I can stay, I can stay awake too, I'm
okay.

01:16:00.118 --> 01:16:00.755
ORION: Cool.

01:16:00.755 --> 01:16:01.725
ASHLEY: So maybe everybody sleep--

01:16:01.725 --> 01:16:02.747
ORION: So I do.

01:16:02.747 --> 01:16:08.003
MATT: Okay. So you use your spell, you seal off
the tunnel with pillars. You can just barely get

01:16:08.003 --> 01:16:13.040
most of the entranceway covered, there's a couple
of small slivers and spaces between.

01:16:13.040 --> 01:16:15.383
ORION: But we would sure hear them, if they
were--

01:16:15.383 --> 01:16:16.402
LAURA: Trying to get through, yeah.

01:16:16.402 --> 01:16:17.172
MATT: Yeah. If they were.

01:16:17.172 --> 01:16:18.073
LAURA: All right.

01:16:18.073 --> 01:16:23.206
MATT: All right. So you guys end up making camp,
are you guys lighting a fire? Or are you keeping

01:16:23.206 --> 01:16:24.295
it dark? What's your plan?

01:16:24.295 --> 01:16:28.189
TRAVIS: Yeah. I've got two firewood bundles in the
bag of Ikea holding.

01:16:28.189 --> 01:16:29.204
TALIESIN: I don't think we need a fire.

01:16:29.204 --> 01:16:30.020
LIAM: I don't think it's a good idea.

01:16:30.020 --> 01:16:30.806
ASHLEY: Do we need a fire?

01:16:30.806 --> 01:16:31.451
LAURA: Yeah.

01:16:31.451 --> 01:16:32.308
LIAM: We're fine. It's warm down here.

01:16:32.308 --> 01:16:33.101
MATT: It's fairly warm.

01:16:33.101 --> 01:16:33.897
LIAM: Yes.

01:16:33.897 --> 01:16:34.444
ORION: Oh.

01:16:34.444 --> 01:16:35.280
TRAVIS: Then, no?

01:16:35.280 --> 01:16:36.459
(all laugh)

01:16:36.459 --> 01:16:42.314
LIAM: We've got Tiberius, if he's awake, can cast
Light, let's just go into one of these tents.

01:16:42.314 --> 01:16:43.531
TRAVIS: I wanna burn something.

01:16:43.531 --> 01:16:44.278
LAURA: I know.

01:16:44.278 --> 01:16:45.176
MARISHA: Yeah, two to a tent.

01:16:45.176 --> 01:16:46.039
LAURA: You can keep burning a torch.

01:16:46.039 --> 01:16:47.926
MARISHA: We can each have our own tent! There's
enough.

01:16:47.926 --> 01:16:48.957
LAURA: Stick it in the ground.

01:16:48.957 --> 01:16:50.171
TRAVIS: Is there anything made of wood down here?

01:16:50.171 --> 01:16:53.204
ORION: I actually have to rest completely, so I
can't do shifts.

01:16:53.204 --> 01:16:54.378
TRAVIS: I want to set it on fire.

01:16:54.378 --> 01:16:55.250
MATT: Okay. Fair enough.

01:16:55.250 --> 01:16:56.476
ORION: I need all my spell slots.

01:16:56.476 --> 01:16:57.484
MARISHA: I need to sleep as well.

01:16:57.484 --> 01:17:01.206
MATT: What wood there is, is used charcoal in the
abandoned fire pit, unfortunately.

01:17:01.206 --> 01:17:02.844
ASHLEY: Yeah, but can you--

01:17:02.844 --> 01:17:05.730
TRAVIS: I wanted to pyro shit.

01:17:05.730 --> 01:17:07.087
MATT: You guys get set up?

01:17:07.087 --> 01:17:11.712
LIAM: I pull out some dice, so that Grog and I can
gamble while everyone are sleeping.

01:17:11.712 --> 01:17:12.798
TRAVIS: Ooh!

01:17:12.798 --> 01:17:13.680
MATT: Fair enough.

01:17:13.680 --> 01:17:16.466
TALIESIN: How much does a rest heal? Out of
curiosity?

01:17:16.466 --> 01:17:17.370
MATT: A rest heals you to full.

01:17:17.370 --> 01:17:18.205
TALIESIN: Oh, excellent.

01:17:18.205 --> 01:17:19.361
LAURA: Oh, sweet! Yeah, let's fully rest.

01:17:19.361 --> 01:17:22.496
TALIESIN: Do I have time to do a quick engineering
feat, as well?

01:17:22.496 --> 01:17:24.069
MATT: You do not have--

01:17:24.069 --> 01:17:25.200
TALIESIN: Oh, okay. Never mind.

01:17:25.200 --> 01:17:27.548
MATT: Like at this point, I mean, you could--
what're you trying to do? I should say.

01:17:27.548 --> 01:17:30.125
TALIESIN: Make an explosive arrow. I'm just in a
mood.

01:17:30.125 --> 01:17:32.326
MATT: Do you have any currently built explosives?

01:17:32.326 --> 01:17:33.868
TALIESIN: No, but I have gunpowder.

01:17:33.868 --> 01:17:37.103
MATT: You know what, I'll let you go ahead and try
it with just your tinker's kit--

01:17:37.103 --> 01:17:37.809
TALIESIN: Yeah.

01:17:37.809 --> 01:17:38.797
LAURA: Tinker's?

01:17:38.797 --> 01:17:39.929
MATT: It's gonna be a difficult--

01:17:39.929 --> 01:17:40.709
TALIESIN: That's fine!

01:17:40.709 --> 01:17:42.102
MATT: -- roll, but go for it.

01:17:42.102 --> 01:17:44.293
TALIESIN: What do I add? Am I just straight roll?

01:17:44.293 --> 01:17:46.851
MATT: You add your proficiency bonus, which is,
the tinker's kit is four.

01:17:46.851 --> 01:17:50.868
TALIESIN: Oh, okay. Proficiency bonus. 15?

01:17:50.868 --> 01:17:59.459
MATT: 15? Okay, okay. You manage to fasten what
appears to be a black powder, impact-based

01:17:59.459 --> 01:18:04.041
explosive to the tip of an arrow. It's a little
weighty and unwieldy, it might not be the most

01:18:04.041 --> 01:18:06.843
accurate thing in the world, but if it hits it's
probably gonna pack a punch.

01:18:06.843 --> 01:18:09.216
TALIESIN: Okay. I have another gift.

01:18:09.216 --> 01:18:10.095
LAURA: You do?

01:18:10.095 --> 01:18:11.108
TALIESIN: Explosive arrow!

01:18:11.108 --> 01:18:12.153
LAURA: This is the best day ever!

01:18:12.153 --> 01:18:13.030
TALIESIN: It's a bit iffy.

01:18:13.030 --> 01:18:13.964
LIAM: (Cary Elwes voice) Gently! Gently!

01:18:13.964 --> 01:18:14.799
ORION: It's a bit iffy.

01:18:14.799 --> 01:18:15.688
LAURA: Gently!

01:18:15.688 --> 01:18:16.453
MARISHA: Don't trust it!

01:18:16.453 --> 01:18:17.265
TALIESIN: It's a bit iffy.

01:18:17.265 --> 01:18:18.206
LAURA: I gingerly put it in my quiver.

01:18:18.206 --> 01:18:19.233
ORION: More like a shotgun.

01:18:19.233 --> 01:18:20.106
TALIESIN: It'll get better. It'll get better.

01:18:20.106 --> 01:18:20.983
TRAVIS: Can you make me an explosive axe?

01:18:20.983 --> 01:18:22.161
MATT: You very gingerly place it within your
quiver.

01:18:22.161 --> 01:18:23.040
LAURA: Oh god, all right.

01:18:23.040 --> 01:18:23.914
TALIESIN: I don't think you want an explosive
axe.

01:18:23.914 --> 01:18:24.908
MATT: It's heavy in the tip.

01:18:24.908 --> 01:18:25.643
TRAVIS: Why?

01:18:25.643 --> 01:18:26.475
MATT: It's one of those things where, you know,
shooting it is

01:18:26.475 --> 01:18:27.426
going to be an interesting challenge.

01:18:27.426 --> 01:18:28.748
LAURA: Should I keep it away from the rest of my
stuff?

01:18:28.748 --> 01:18:29.625
MATT: That's up to you!

01:18:29.625 --> 01:18:31.069
LAURA: Is there a possibility it could explode
just--

01:18:31.069 --> 01:18:32.001
ORION: You haven't even played with your hammer
yet!

01:18:32.001 --> 01:18:32.779
MATT: I dunno.

01:18:32.779 --> 01:18:35.121
TALIESIN: It's very unlikely to explode on by
itself. 'Cause it needs to be moving at a high

01:18:35.121 --> 01:18:39.098
speed. But it's just not the best thing ever.

01:18:39.098 --> 01:18:40.843
LAURA: Maybe I won't keep it straight behind my
head.

01:18:40.843 --> 01:18:42.120
TALIESIN: Yeah, no. Not straight behind.

01:18:42.120 --> 01:18:44.010
LAURA: Let's just kind of keep it down at my
waist--

01:18:44.010 --> 01:18:44.956
LIAM: Off to the side.

01:18:44.956 --> 01:18:46.041
LAURA: With the dagger, maybe.

01:18:46.041 --> 01:18:46.626
MATT: Okay.

01:18:46.626 --> 01:18:47.731
LAURA: Is that cool?

01:18:47.731 --> 01:18:49.273
TALIESIN: The next one will be better.

01:18:49.273 --> 01:18:50.027
MATT: All right.

01:18:50.027 --> 01:18:51.452
LAURA: All right. Did we all rest? Are we all
rested?

01:18:51.452 --> 01:18:52.169
TALIESIN: Yep.

01:18:52.169 --> 01:18:55.953
MATT: As the evening transpires, you all get your
evenings of rest, you guys kind of keeping watch,

01:18:55.953 --> 01:19:03.579
gambling away. At a certain point, throughout the
evening, something perks up your ears. You begin

01:19:03.579 --> 01:19:07.442
hearing footsteps, many footsteps.

01:19:07.442 --> 01:19:08.480
LIAM: Many footsteps.

01:19:08.480 --> 01:19:10.575
LAURA: (gasps) Oh no. How many is many? A lot.

01:19:10.575 --> 01:19:11.799
LIAM: How many does it sound like?

01:19:11.799 --> 01:19:13.703
MATT: It sounds like anywhere between six, ten,
more--

01:19:13.703 --> 01:19:16.097
LIAM: From, right, from up? Or down.

01:19:16.097 --> 01:19:16.854
MATT: From above, yeah.

01:19:16.854 --> 01:19:17.682
LIAM: From above.

01:19:17.682 --> 01:19:18.473
TRAVIS: Up. Oh.

01:19:18.473 --> 01:19:19.422
LAURA: We should wake up.

01:19:19.422 --> 01:19:20.242
ASHLEY: From above?

01:19:20.242 --> 01:19:21.025
TRAVIS: Like, the ceiling? Or--

01:19:21.025 --> 01:19:21.762
LAURA: Well like the-- no, no, no. From like--

01:19:21.762 --> 01:19:22.610
ASHLEY: Like where you have the--

01:19:22.610 --> 01:19:23.565
LAURA: Up the path, right?

01:19:23.565 --> 01:19:24.320
MATT: Up the path you guys came from.

01:19:24.320 --> 01:19:25.277
LIAM: Wait. Grog and I are the only ones awake,
right?

01:19:25.277 --> 01:19:25.878
ASHLEY: That he shielded off?

01:19:25.878 --> 01:19:26.578
ORION: Yeah, it's sealed.

01:19:26.578 --> 01:19:27.247
TRAVIS: Yep.

01:19:27.247 --> 01:19:27.706
MATT: Yep.

01:19:27.706 --> 01:19:28.450
LIAM: Grog and I are the only ones awake.

01:19:28.450 --> 01:19:28.917
ORION: Right.

01:19:28.917 --> 01:19:30.873
LIAM: Do we lay low, and hold quiet in these
tents? Or do we get everyone up?

01:19:30.873 --> 01:19:35.208
LAURA: They're gonna know, 'cause we blocked off
the friggin' path! I'm asleep. Sorry.

01:19:35.208 --> 01:19:35.621
LIAM: Yeah.

01:19:35.621 --> 01:19:36.472
ASHLEY: I'm still awake.

01:19:36.472 --> 01:19:37.629
TRAVIS: Lay low. Let them come.

01:19:37.629 --> 01:19:39.145
LIAM: I think so.

01:19:39.145 --> 01:19:42.282
LAURA: (whispers) What? You're just really--

01:19:42.282 --> 01:19:43.471
TRAVIS: Keep sleeping and shut up!

01:19:43.471 --> 01:19:45.811
LIAM: No, no, no, I rouse my sister quietly.

01:19:45.811 --> 01:19:46.559
LAURA: What?

01:19:46.559 --> 01:19:47.431
TRAVIS: Oh. Fine.

01:19:47.431 --> 01:19:48.257
LIAM: She's in this tent.

01:19:48.257 --> 01:19:49.222
TRAVIS: Wake her up.

01:19:49.222 --> 01:19:50.031
LAURA: What's going--

01:19:50.031 --> 01:19:52.248
LIAM: (whispers) Quiet.

01:19:52.248 --> 01:19:54.096
MATT: All right. Leaving the rest asleep?

01:19:54.096 --> 01:19:54.671
LIAM: Yeah.

01:19:54.671 --> 01:19:55.962
LAURA: I stealth.

01:19:55.962 --> 01:19:56.983
MATT: The three of you make a stealth check.

01:19:56.983 --> 01:19:58.394
TRAVIS: I stealth as well.

01:19:58.394 --> 01:20:00.353
MATT: You do, Grog. You do.

01:20:00.353 --> 01:20:01.082
LAURA: God damn.

01:20:01.082 --> 01:20:02.181
TRAVIS: Fuck yeah! A two!

01:20:02.181 --> 01:20:03.221
LAURA: I should stop rolling this fucking dice.

01:20:03.221 --> 01:20:04.376
TRAVIS: 17.

01:20:04.376 --> 01:20:05.347
ASHLEY: Wait, are you guys asleep?

01:20:05.347 --> 01:20:06.151
LIAM: 23.

01:20:06.151 --> 01:20:06.980
MARISHA: I'm still passed out.

01:20:06.980 --> 01:20:08.218
LAURA: Oh! Yeah, that was a one. This, by the
way--

01:20:08.218 --> 01:20:08.994
MATT: Again?

01:20:08.994 --> 01:20:10.086
LAURA: -- was given to me by Wil Wheaton.

01:20:10.086 --> 01:20:11.218
TRAVIS: Yeah. Wake up your sister.

01:20:11.218 --> 01:20:12.268
LAURA: Thank you, Wil.

01:20:12.268 --> 01:20:13.442
TRAVIS: It was just us boys--

01:20:13.442 --> 01:20:14.472
MATT: Thank you, Wil.

01:20:14.472 --> 01:20:15.700
TRAVIS: -- and then you woke her up.

01:20:15.700 --> 01:20:16.457
MATT: All right, so--

01:20:16.457 --> 01:20:17.532
ASHLEY: Wait, I was awake too.

01:20:17.532 --> 01:20:18.245
MATT: You were awake too?

01:20:18.245 --> 01:20:18.873
ASHLEY: Yes.

01:20:18.873 --> 01:20:19.727
MATT: At this point? You weren't resting?

01:20:19.727 --> 01:20:20.444
TRAVIS: What. You?

01:20:20.444 --> 01:20:21.067
LAURA: No, she was--

01:20:21.067 --> 01:20:21.840
TRAVIS: Oh, she was actually awake.

01:20:21.840 --> 01:20:22.970
ASHLEY: Because I was, I was still at full--

01:20:22.970 --> 01:20:23.953
LAURA: (whispers) But you needed your spells.

01:20:23.953 --> 01:20:24.629
MATT: Okay, then--

01:20:24.629 --> 01:20:25.553
ASHLEY: Oh, but my spells? Actually--

01:20:25.553 --> 01:20:27.037
MATT: If you're not resting you don't get your
spells back.

01:20:27.037 --> 01:20:27.854
ORION: Yeah, you need--

01:20:27.854 --> 01:20:30.590
ASHLEY: -- I fell asleep! I totally forgot. I am
sound asleep.

01:20:30.590 --> 01:20:31.537
MARISHA: Totally forgot I fell asleep!

01:20:31.537 --> 01:20:32.454
ASHLEY: I was dreaming--

01:20:32.454 --> 01:20:33.811
TRAVIS: She dreamed, in the dream she was still
awake.

01:20:33.811 --> 01:20:34.969
MATT: You are welcome to stay awake if you want,
but you just won't get your spells back.

01:20:34.969 --> 01:20:36.023
ASHLEY: I was dreaming, it was real--

01:20:36.023 --> 01:20:36.677
MATT: You'd probably be exhausted.

01:20:36.677 --> 01:20:37.609
ASHLEY: -- I was so confused, by my dream.

01:20:37.609 --> 01:20:38.573
TALIESIN: You were just going all Inception on
us.

01:20:38.573 --> 01:20:39.392
LIAM: You know, when you can't fall asleep--

01:20:39.392 --> 01:20:40.121
ASHLEY: My perception was off.

01:20:40.121 --> 01:20:41.780
LIAM: -- and you're like, am I dreaming? Or is
this the dream? Or is it real?

01:20:41.780 --> 01:20:42.701
TALIESIN: Spin the top. Spin the top.

01:20:42.701 --> 01:20:43.387
ASHLEY: I was totally sleeping.

01:20:43.387 --> 01:20:44.315
LIAM: And you wake up, and you have to pee, it's
hard to tell.

01:20:44.315 --> 01:20:45.336
ASHLEY: And I spaced.

01:20:45.336 --> 01:20:46.412
TRAVIS: So the three of us are up.

01:20:46.412 --> 01:20:47.467
ASHLEY: I was asleep.

01:20:47.467 --> 01:20:50.536
MATT: All right. So. Between the three of you,
thankfully, you had two successes against one

01:20:50.536 --> 01:20:52.865
failure. You manage to cover for your sister--

01:20:52.865 --> 01:20:53.575
LIAM: Shake it off.

01:20:53.575 --> 01:20:54.272
LAURA: Thank you, thank you.

01:20:54.272 --> 01:20:55.205
MATT: -- who, who, 'Huh? What? What?'

01:20:55.205 --> 01:20:55.971
LAURA: Ah-- what? What?

01:20:55.971 --> 01:20:56.789
MATT: When you wake her up.

01:20:56.789 --> 01:20:57.860
LIAM: Sh! Sh.

01:20:57.860 --> 01:21:04.482
MATT: You guys quietly wait--

01:21:04.482 --> 01:21:05.545
TRAVIS: Oh no, that was a bad expression!

01:21:05.545 --> 01:21:06.911
LIAM: Daggers out! Daggers out!

01:21:06.911 --> 01:21:08.518
ASHLEY: Or that was good?

01:21:08.518 --> 01:21:10.071
MATT: All right. So.

01:21:10.071 --> 01:21:11.228
LAURA: Oh no. Did eyebrows go up?

01:21:11.228 --> 01:21:12.460
TALIESIN: (whistles In the Hall of the Mountain
King)

01:21:12.460 --> 01:21:17.775
MATT: The footsteps progress through, and you--
there's no light source, as duergar for the most

01:21:17.775 --> 01:21:19.559
part do not require light to see in the tunnels.

01:21:19.559 --> 01:21:21.151
LAURA: Can we see through the dark-- but we can
see in the dark?

01:21:21.151 --> 01:21:23.125
MATT: You guys have low-light vision, not dark
vision.

01:21:23.125 --> 01:21:24.035
LIAM: Not dark vision.

01:21:24.035 --> 01:21:25.395
LAURA: There's no light in this area at all?

01:21:25.395 --> 01:21:26.267
TRAVIS: No! It's balls-ass dark!

01:21:26.267 --> 01:21:27.116
LIAM: There's no fire--

01:21:27.116 --> 01:21:28.081
MATT: No, it is pitch black. You just hear--

01:21:28.081 --> 01:21:28.921
LIAM: On purpose no fire.

01:21:28.921 --> 01:21:30.418
MATT: -- you just hear the footprints go by.

01:21:30.418 --> 01:21:31.217
TRAVIS: Good thing we didn't make a campfire!

01:21:31.217 --> 01:21:32.090
LIAM: Sh, sh!

01:21:32.090 --> 01:21:35.540
MATT: You hear them approach the outskirts of the
alcove.

01:21:35.540 --> 01:21:37.061
ASHLEY: I have dark vision, gosh dang it!

01:21:37.061 --> 01:21:37.916
MATT: But you're asleep.

01:21:37.916 --> 01:21:39.291
ASHLEY: I'm fucking sleeping.

01:21:39.291 --> 01:21:40.516
MATT: Yes, you are.

01:21:40.516 --> 01:21:41.745
(all laugh)

01:21:41.745 --> 01:21:43.498
ASHLEY: Bad choices, all around!

01:21:43.498 --> 01:21:45.850
LIAM: They're going!

01:21:45.850 --> 01:21:50.020
MATT: As the footsteps approach the outskirts of
the alcove, the rest of you sleeping soundly,

01:21:50.020 --> 01:21:58.030
unaware of what's transpiring-- A few moments
pass, and the footprints appear to be passing,

01:21:58.030 --> 01:22:02.640
past, downward into the tunnel.

01:22:02.640 --> 01:22:04.451
(all laugh)

01:22:04.451 --> 01:22:08.970
MATT: Eventually, when the footfalls dissipate,
and silence once again takes the camp, you breathe

01:22:08.970 --> 01:22:12.015
a sigh of relief and remove your hand from Vex's
face.

01:22:12.015 --> 01:22:14.188
TRAVIS: Well, maybe just leave it there.

01:22:14.188 --> 01:22:16.093
LIAM: Last time I did that I got kicked in the
nuts, very hard.

01:22:16.093 --> 01:22:19.780
TRAVIS: And liked it.

01:22:19.780 --> 01:22:25.468
MATT: All right. So. Eventually, when you feel
enough time has passed, where those who've been

01:22:25.468 --> 01:22:30.571
resting come from their sleep, spells recovered,
wounds are healed, except for those who didn't

01:22:30.571 --> 01:22:33.942
sleep, you guys maintain the same health you had
previously.

01:22:33.942 --> 01:22:38.094
ASHLEY: What a good sleep I've had! I have all my
spells back!

01:22:38.094 --> 01:22:41.254
MATT: That also puts a level of exhaustion-- So.
There is one level of

01:22:41.254 --> 01:22:43.105
exhaustion on both of you currently.

01:22:43.105 --> 01:22:44.129
LIAM: Sure. So what does that do to us?

01:22:44.129 --> 01:22:44.778
LAURA: Oh no.

01:22:44.778 --> 01:22:45.390
ORION: Ah. You fools!

01:22:45.390 --> 01:22:46.531
MATT: It just means any ability checks you take--

01:22:46.531 --> 01:22:47.272
LIAM: Yes.

01:22:47.272 --> 01:22:48.260
MATT: So, any skills you take are at disadvantage
until you get a full night's rest.

01:22:48.260 --> 01:22:49.218
TRAVIS: I'll take one more level two potion right
now.

01:22:49.218 --> 01:22:50.365
LIAM: Skill? Skill. Okay.

01:22:50.365 --> 01:22:51.524
TRAVIS: One more level two potion.

01:22:51.524 --> 01:22:55.817
MATT: Okay. You can use-- remember, you can use
your hit dice to heal still, before you start

01:22:55.817 --> 01:22:57.718
throwing potions around. If you have a moment to
rest--

01:22:57.718 --> 01:22:59.980
LAURA: Hit dice. We forgot about that because it
wasn't there before.

01:22:59.980 --> 01:23:04.220
MATT: Yeah. (sings) Fifth Edition! Before you
start throwing potions around, 'cause remember,

01:23:04.220 --> 01:23:09.208
you're far away from civilization right now, you
have a very limited number of potions now to lead

01:23:09.208 --> 01:23:11.541
you through here, unless you find some way to
return to the surface.

01:23:11.541 --> 01:23:15.954
LIAM: Just for emergencies.

01:23:15.954 --> 01:23:16.529
ORION: What's happening?

01:23:16.529 --> 01:23:17.389
LIAM: In combat.

01:23:17.389 --> 01:23:21.403
MATT: So. You all eventually come back to
consciousness, in this darkened alcove, pitch

01:23:21.403 --> 01:23:27.866
black. It is still warm, slight smell of soot and
dust in the air, what do you guys want to do?

01:23:27.866 --> 01:23:29.088
LIAM: I have a question.

01:23:29.088 --> 01:23:29.801
MATT: Yes.

01:23:29.801 --> 01:23:35.097
LIAM: Outside of existence. Tiberius put up a
stone, right?

01:23:35.097 --> 01:23:35.811
MATT: Mm-hm.

01:23:35.811 --> 01:23:38.310
LIAM: But I didn't hear any (impact sounds),
right?

01:23:38.310 --> 01:23:43.015
LAURA: Oh, no, he put it up next to our alcove.
So, they just kind of passed by our alcove.

01:23:43.015 --> 01:23:44.548
MATT: It basically matched the wall as you guys
went around.

01:23:44.548 --> 01:23:46.550
LIAM: Oh. So we sealed ourselves into this little
pocket?

01:23:46.550 --> 01:23:47.464
LAURA: Yes. We did.

01:23:47.464 --> 01:23:50.286
LIAM: Oh. We didn't even friggin' need to hide in
the tent! We were in a little bubble of air!

01:23:50.286 --> 01:23:51.973
LAURA: Well, no, well, it's pillars, though, they
could have--

01:23:51.973 --> 01:23:52.946
MATT: You're not completely in there.

01:23:52.946 --> 01:23:53.810
LAURA: -- they could have seen us.

01:23:53.810 --> 01:23:54.278
LIAM: Okay.

01:23:54.278 --> 01:23:56.174
MATT: He could block off most of it, there's like
little spaces between--

01:23:56.174 --> 01:23:57.667
LIAM: Spaces. Okay. All right. Thank you.

01:23:57.667 --> 01:24:02.831
LAURA: I think we should all freshen up, since
it's a new day!

01:24:02.831 --> 01:24:05.591
LIAM: Right. We're all healed, maybe-- Does anyone
have to pee? Or perhaps--

01:24:05.591 --> 01:24:06.460
LAURA: Yeah, that.

01:24:06.460 --> 01:24:07.102
ASHLEY: Yeah.

01:24:07.102 --> 01:24:07.771
LAURA: That.

01:24:07.771 --> 01:24:08.528
ORION: Is anyone particularly dirty?

01:24:08.528 --> 01:24:09.584
LAURA: Intermission!

01:24:09.584 --> 01:24:13.641
MATT: Indeed. So. This, given the point in time
that you all wake from your slumber, we'll

01:24:13.641 --> 01:24:16.455
continue this in a few minutes. In the meantime,
we're gonna go ahead and go to our intermission

01:24:16.455 --> 01:24:19.524
break. See you guys back here in about 12 minutes
or so.

01:24:19.524 --> 01:24:20.448
MARISHA: Oh, cool.

01:24:20.448 --> 01:24:22.643
ZAC: So we're gonna update everyone real quick.

01:24:22.643 --> 01:24:23.565
MATT: All right, what you got, man?

01:24:23.565 --> 01:24:25.205
ZAC: You guys can go, you guys can go.

01:24:25.205 --> 01:24:26.125
MATT: Go, go!

01:24:26.125 --> 01:24:28.235
ZAC: Matt and I are gonna chat. Lucas, can you
turn down all the

01:24:28.235 --> 01:24:29.271
other mics while they're exiting?

01:24:29.271 --> 01:24:30.799
(fart noises in background)

01:24:30.799 --> 01:24:35.641
ZAC: So guys, we already gave away one promo kit,
so we reached our first goal.

01:24:35.641 --> 01:24:36.855
MATT: Awesome. Fantastic.

01:24:36.855 --> 01:24:39.001
ZAC: That's one. I'm gonna bring out a poster for
you guys to sign that

01:24:39.001 --> 01:24:40.272
we'll put inside the promo kit with it.

01:24:40.272 --> 01:24:41.085
MATT: Perfect.

01:24:41.085 --> 01:24:44.964
ZAC: And we're actually pretty close to giving
away our second promo kit. So, just so you guys

01:24:44.964 --> 01:24:52.470
know-- what the shit? If we get another 50, I
think it's like 40 more, or 38 more? The number's

01:24:52.470 --> 01:24:56.838
on the bottom. We'll give away another promo kit,
and these guys will all sign the poster that goes

01:24:56.838 --> 01:24:59.958
inside, and we'll get that shipped out to you as
quickly as possible.

01:24:59.958 --> 01:25:01.104
MATT: Yeah, do it.

01:25:01.104 --> 01:25:04.292
ZAC: That's pretty much the only update there. Oh,
do you want to make a quick mention about the

01:25:04.292 --> 01:25:08.346
charity that you guys work with? Because we've
been posting that in the chat room.

01:25:08.346 --> 01:25:13.100
MATT: Yes, yes. Yes, 826LA, guys, is a charity
that we've been been trying to raise money for.

01:25:13.100 --> 01:25:20.872
Essentially, it's a Los Angeles-based, also in San
Francisco and other parts of the nation. It helps

01:25:20.872 --> 01:25:26.388
teach and tutor children in literacy,
storytelling-- it's a really great charity. Go

01:25:26.388 --> 01:25:31.036
ahead and look on the website 826LA.com for any
and all information you require on it. But they

01:25:31.036 --> 01:25:34.339
are a really good cause, they're good people, and
been a fan of their work for a long time. So we

01:25:34.339 --> 01:25:37.610
are happy to help however we can and however you
guys are able to help as well. So.

01:25:37.610 --> 01:25:42.684
ZAC: Great. If the mods want to post the command
'criticalrole', you guys can link to that charity

01:25:42.771 --> 01:25:46.292
and we'll go ahead and roll those videos so you
guys can get updated on the characters, and we'll

01:25:46.292 --> 01:25:47.386
be back in a little bit.

01:25:47.386 --> 01:25:48.609
MATT: See you guys in a little bit.

01:25:48.609 --> 01:39:10.824
[character intros]

01:39:10.911 --> 01:39:14.408
MATT: Welcome back, guys. All right, I think
everyone is

01:39:14.473 --> 01:39:17.575
sufficiently rested and bathroom breaked.

01:39:17.575 --> 01:39:18.093
LAURA: Yep.

01:39:18.093 --> 01:39:23.598
MATT: And so we will pick it back up. So as you
all regain consciousness and prepare yourselves for

01:39:23.598 --> 01:39:29.246
the day ahead, once again, you've gone a number of
days without sunlight, without any vision of the

01:39:29.331 --> 01:39:32.788
sky. It's a very disorienting experience for all
of you who are unfamiliar with subterranean

01:39:32.819 --> 01:39:37.341
territory. Even though you are rested, you don't
feel rested. There's kinks in your back from the

01:39:37.341 --> 01:39:41.498
rocky floor. The best you could find yourself any
sort of comfort here is from whatever you have on

01:39:41.498 --> 01:39:48.755
your back. Most of you sleep in your armor out of
necessity and paranoia. As consciousness comes to

01:39:48.755 --> 01:39:55.269
you, you guys are able to try and find your way
back out now that you've been sealed in.

01:39:55.269 --> 01:39:57.162
LAURA: Can we squish through the little cracks?

01:39:57.162 --> 01:39:57.907
MATT: No.

01:39:57.907 --> 01:39:58.875
LAURA: We have to cut it down?

01:39:58.875 --> 01:40:03.310
MATT: You have about a five, six-inch gap between
each of them.

01:40:03.310 --> 01:40:06.250
LAURA: So we've gotta break our way out of here,
Grog.

01:40:06.316 --> 01:40:07.950
TRAVIS: Oh, do I get to hit things?

01:40:07.950 --> 01:40:09.003
MATT: You do.

01:40:09.003 --> 01:40:10.088
LIAM: Start smacking the wall.

01:40:10.088 --> 01:40:10.848
TRAVIS: My god.

01:40:10.848 --> 01:40:13.741
ASHLEY: Can I just give it a try, just to see? Try
make a dent.

01:40:13.741 --> 01:40:15.762
MATT: Yeah, go ahead and make an athletics check.

01:40:15.762 --> 01:40:20.009
TRAVIS: And just to try it out, I would like bring
out the flaming hammer of--

01:40:20.009 --> 01:40:22.957
MATT: Actually, for this I would say it's a
straight strength check. This is just physicality,

01:40:22.957 --> 01:40:26.909
strength against the stonework.

01:40:26.909 --> 01:40:29.132
LIAM: Might need to take your armor off.

01:40:29.132 --> 01:40:30.009
ASHLEY: Strength is?

01:40:30.009 --> 01:40:30.605
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:40:30.605 --> 01:40:31.264
LAURA: Oh, it's right here.

01:40:31.264 --> 01:40:33.346
TRAVIS: 23.

01:40:33.414 --> 01:40:35.210
MATT: All right.

01:40:35.210 --> 01:40:36.280
TRAVIS: With the hammer.

01:40:36.280 --> 01:40:36.797
ASHLEY: Ten.

01:40:36.797 --> 01:40:38.339
MARISHA: We're playing pillar pinata.

01:40:38.339 --> 01:40:44.147
MATT: All right, so as Pike-- as you go and swing
at the pillar, you impact with all your might and

01:40:44.147 --> 01:40:49.101
the pillar cracks at the impact. You're like,
'that is awesome', then you look up a few inches

01:40:49.188 --> 01:40:51.197
and notice that Grog's ax is also in the same
pillar.

01:40:51.197 --> 01:40:51.779
ASHLEY: Oh.

01:40:51.779 --> 01:40:53.116
(all laugh)

01:40:53.116 --> 01:40:54.356
ASHLEY: Yay teamwork, teamwork.

01:40:54.356 --> 01:40:55.917
TRAVIS: Yay, you loosened it up for me.

01:40:55.917 --> 01:40:56.852
ASHLEY: Yeah I did!

01:40:56.852 --> 01:40:57.565
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:40:57.565 --> 01:40:58.912
LIAM: (singing) That's fuckin' teamwork.

01:40:58.912 --> 01:41:00.612
ASHLEY: Best pals!

01:41:00.612 --> 01:41:06.319
MATT: You guys, you take five or six minutes or
so. You manage to hack away enough in one of the

01:41:06.319 --> 01:41:12.319
pillars to leave enough room to squeeze through.
It takes a while. You manage to cleave that open.

01:41:12.319 --> 01:41:17.411
You all gather your things, you group together and
you can continue in whichever direction you wish.

01:41:17.411 --> 01:41:18.683
ASHLEY: Down.

01:41:18.683 --> 01:41:20.038
TRAVIS: Yeah, we're going down.

01:41:20.038 --> 01:41:22.483
MATT: All right, as you guys--

01:41:22.483 --> 01:41:23.704
LAURA: Stealth!

01:41:23.704 --> 01:41:27.724
LIAM: There are also some, I believe some duergar
we didn't tell you--

01:41:27.724 --> 01:41:28.935
LAURA: Ahead of us.

01:41:28.935 --> 01:41:35.110
LIAM: Yes, while you were sleeping in the middle
of the night, duergar walked-- I assume--

01:41:35.110 --> 01:41:35.853
LAURA: Dooragar?

01:41:35.853 --> 01:41:36.599
LIAM: Duraga.

01:41:36.599 --> 01:41:38.841
LIAM: (in odd accent) Duergar, some duergar walked
down the passageway while you were sleeping.

01:41:38.841 --> 01:41:39.689
TALIESIN: Doo-agar.

01:41:39.689 --> 01:41:40.290
ORION: Duragar.

01:41:40.290 --> 01:41:41.354
ASHLEY: Dooagar.

01:41:41.354 --> 01:41:43.773
LIAM: But we thought it best to lay low and they
went on.

01:41:43.773 --> 01:41:44.383
MARISHA: That's good.

01:41:44.383 --> 01:41:45.187
LAURA: Yes.

01:41:45.187 --> 01:41:46.337
LIAM: So, steady as she goes.

01:41:46.337 --> 01:41:47.174
LAURA: They might be ahead of us.

01:41:47.174 --> 01:41:48.112
TALIESIN: We should probably be quiet.

01:41:48.112 --> 01:41:50.599
MARISHA: Before we leave, I wanna go ahead and
take a minute to meditate. If you guys can, you

01:41:50.599 --> 01:41:52.597
know, just watch while I meditate.

01:41:52.597 --> 01:41:53.425
TALIESIN: Oh god.

01:41:53.425 --> 01:41:54.589
LAURA: And lend our energy to you.

01:41:54.589 --> 01:41:58.978
MARISHA: Yes, if you guys could lend your positive
energy it would be very helpful.

01:41:58.978 --> 01:42:00.042
TRAVIS: (fart sounds)

01:42:00.042 --> 01:42:01.225
MARISHA: So I can Commune With Nature.

01:42:01.431 --> 01:42:02.421
TALIESIN: I'll be out of the hole.

01:42:02.421 --> 01:42:04.257
MARISHA: I want to do Commune (pronouncing
incorrectly) With Nature.

01:42:04.257 --> 01:42:05.509
MATT: Commune? (pronouncing correctly)

01:42:05.509 --> 01:42:07.168
MARISHA: Yes, or Commune, whatever.

01:42:07.168 --> 01:42:08.645
MATT: You wanna start a commune in nature?

01:42:08.645 --> 01:42:09.452
TRAVIS: Commune.

01:42:09.452 --> 01:42:10.307
MARISHA: Yeah, I want to start a commune in
nature.

01:42:10.307 --> 01:42:11.219
TALIESIN: Commune in a commune.

01:42:11.219 --> 01:42:12.852
ORION: Can we do that? How high is that roll
again?

01:42:12.852 --> 01:42:13.920
MARISHA: Commune in commune in a commune.

01:42:13.920 --> 01:42:15.063
LIAM: Going the homeopathic route, I like it.

01:42:15.063 --> 01:42:15.886
MARISHA: That one.

01:42:15.886 --> 01:42:18.533
MATT: Okay, keeping the best essence--

01:42:18.533 --> 01:42:19.756
TALIESIN: Oh god.

01:42:19.756 --> 01:42:27.201
MATT: -- of the scenery around you, you take a
moment. What's the reach of that one?

01:42:27.201 --> 01:42:38.049
MARISHA: Just read it, where is it?

01:42:38.049 --> 01:42:38.887
MATT: Whatcha got?

01:42:38.887 --> 01:42:40.230
MARISHA: Three miles.

01:42:40.230 --> 01:42:44.279
MATT: Three miles. The natural entities that you
can sense in this cavern system are the few

01:42:44.279 --> 01:42:57.358
clusters of bats that exist in the back portion of
the war camp that you guys just ran from. That's

01:42:57.358 --> 01:43:02.029
about it, I mean, there are a few other strange
things that you've seen that live down here, but

01:43:02.029 --> 01:43:04.251
they wouldn't be anything that you would naturally
sense.

01:43:04.251 --> 01:43:07.306
TRAVIS: What more do you see?

01:43:07.306 --> 01:43:12.598
MARISHA: Lots of bats. They're very nice bats

01:43:12.598 --> 01:43:13.466
TRAVIS: Well, that's good.

01:43:13.466 --> 01:43:14.280
ORION: I love bats.

01:43:14.280 --> 01:43:17.629
MARISHA: Very pleasant, they're very friendly.
That's about it.

01:43:17.629 --> 01:43:18.367
ORION: Very good.

01:43:18.367 --> 01:43:19.278
LAURA: Bats.

01:43:19.278 --> 01:43:20.545
MARISHA and TALIESIN: Bats.

01:43:20.545 --> 01:43:22.016
MARISHA: Okay, carry on, let's go.

01:43:22.190 --> 01:43:22.951
TRAVIS: Oh, good.

01:43:22.951 --> 01:43:23.600
LAURA: All right.

01:43:23.600 --> 01:43:24.563
MARISHA: Thank you for your positive energy.

01:43:24.563 --> 01:43:25.063
LAURA: Nice.

01:43:25.063 --> 01:43:27.725
MATT: All right, you guys step back into the
tunnel, all of you squeezing through with the rest

01:43:27.725 --> 01:43:35.154
of your materials, heading further down. About 15
minutes of travel go by and the very air itself is

01:43:35.154 --> 01:43:37.464
becoming steadily warmer.

01:43:37.464 --> 01:43:38.951
TALIESIN: It's humid in here.

01:43:38.951 --> 01:43:46.490
MATT: The smell is this combination of still
water, groundwater type of a scent mixed with an

01:43:46.490 --> 01:43:51.808
ever-growing kind of sulfur-type, brimstone
smell.

01:43:51.808 --> 01:43:53.128
LIAM: Smells like Grog.

01:43:53.319 --> 01:43:55.280
TRAVIS: I would like to trip Vax.

01:43:55.280 --> 01:43:56.404
(all laugh)

01:43:56.404 --> 01:43:57.331
LIAM: That was quick.

01:43:57.331 --> 01:43:58.333
(all laugh)

01:43:58.333 --> 01:43:59.330
TRAVIS: As he's walking.

01:43:59.330 --> 01:44:04.293
LIAM: I insult you and you trip me in a half a
second? Would you like to take a shot at my nads

01:44:04.293 --> 01:44:05.474
as well?

01:44:05.474 --> 01:44:07.044
LAURA: You knew it was coming, as well.

01:44:07.044 --> 01:44:08.017
MATT: Make an athletics check.

01:44:08.017 --> 01:44:12.323
TRAVIS: Yes! 24!

01:44:12.323 --> 01:44:13.653
MATT: Make an acrobatics check.

01:44:13.653 --> 01:44:14.918
TRAVIS: Suck it, elf.

01:44:14.918 --> 01:44:20.836
LIAM: What goes around comes around, baby. 22.

01:44:20.836 --> 01:44:22.449
MARISHA: Ooh.

01:44:22.449 --> 01:44:25.727
MATT: (impact sound) Face down, Vax.

01:44:25.727 --> 01:44:26.546
TRAVIS: Yes!

01:44:26.546 --> 01:44:29.962
MATT: A slight bruise on the cheek as you go
faceplanting into the stonework ahead of you.

01:44:29.962 --> 01:44:30.859
TALIESIN: For god's sake.

01:44:30.859 --> 01:44:33.043
LIAM: I'm going to voluntarily erase one hit
point.

01:44:33.043 --> 01:44:39.360
TRAVIS: What, what happened? What happened? Did
you not stealth past that little pebble?

01:44:39.360 --> 01:44:45.921
LIAM: It's all right, when the illithid general is
bearing down on your walnut-sized brain--

01:44:45.921 --> 01:44:46.775
TRAVIS: Yeah?

01:44:46.775 --> 01:44:48.277
LIAM: I may be there, I may not.

01:44:48.277 --> 01:44:51.709
ASHLEY: Hey! Don't be rude to him!

01:44:51.709 --> 01:44:52.785
LAURA: You guys, you guys.

01:44:52.785 --> 01:44:54.217
TRAVIS: Oh, I'm so happy right now.

01:44:54.217 --> 01:44:55.491
LAURA: These caverns are getting to us.

01:44:55.491 --> 01:44:57.922
(all laugh)

01:44:57.922 --> 01:44:59.838
MATT: Clarota shuffles alongside you guys.

01:44:59.838 --> 01:45:01.515
LIAM: Right, everyone, we're getting slap-happy.

01:45:01.515 --> 01:45:02.809
LAURA: All right, all right, all right, let's call
this.

01:45:02.809 --> 01:45:03.972
TRAVIS: That's all I wanted.

01:45:03.972 --> 01:45:04.715
ASHLEY: Lack of oxygen.

01:45:04.715 --> 01:45:05.584
LAURA: We're going crazy down here.

01:45:05.584 --> 01:45:06.604
MARISHA: Grog, it's only 9:30 in the morning.

01:45:06.604 --> 01:45:07.448
ORION: I feel fine.

01:45:07.448 --> 01:45:08.480
MARISHA: For christ's sake.

01:45:08.480 --> 01:45:12.889
MATT: As you guys are walking, you're welcome to
make chatter, any discussions you'd like.

01:45:12.889 --> 01:45:17.170
LIAM: That was a high acrobatics roll. I think the
DM wanted me to eat shit.

01:45:17.170 --> 01:45:18.334
MATT: No, it was yours versus his.

01:45:18.334 --> 01:45:18.988
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:45:18.988 --> 01:45:19.481
LAURA: Yeah.

01:45:19.481 --> 01:45:20.382
LIAM: Oh, really? It was a direct contest?

01:45:20.382 --> 01:45:21.613
MATT: It was a direct versus 24 versus 22. He
won.

01:45:21.613 --> 01:45:22.958
LIAM: You still wanted me to eat shit.

01:45:22.958 --> 01:45:25.899
MATT: No, it's up to the rolls, man.

01:45:25.899 --> 01:45:28.790
MARISHA: So wait, we get a chance to chat for a
second?

01:45:28.874 --> 01:45:29.829
ORION: Yes.

01:45:29.829 --> 01:45:37.055
MARISHA: Pike, did you ever fully tell us what all
you saw in your vision? I mean, have you perhaps

01:45:37.055 --> 01:45:38.302
had any more visions?

01:45:38.302 --> 01:45:39.671
LAURA: Visions? You had a vision?

01:45:39.671 --> 01:45:40.763
ASHLEY: I did, I did.

01:45:40.763 --> 01:45:41.690
LAURA: What?

01:45:41.690 --> 01:45:53.630
ASHLEY: So, when I stayed away, I went to a shrine
of Sarenrae, just to sorta see, 'cause I had a

01:45:53.630 --> 01:46:04.556
feeling that I'd been here, or something like
that. So in this vision, I basically saw what

01:46:04.556 --> 01:46:07.664
we've been going through already.

01:46:07.664 --> 01:46:08.909
MARISHA: What?

01:46:08.909 --> 01:46:21.012
ASHLEY: And what the soldier was talking about. So
I saw something that was-- there was a single

01:46:21.012 --> 01:46:24.350
twisted horn of blackened soul matter.

01:46:24.350 --> 01:46:26.038
LAURA: Oh, soul matter?

01:46:26.038 --> 01:46:27.266
MARISHA: Soul matter?

01:46:27.266 --> 01:46:27.951
TALIESIN: Oh.

01:46:27.951 --> 01:46:28.797
LIAM: Sounds dirty.

01:46:28.797 --> 01:46:31.970
ASHLEY: It was a point of concentrated evil.

01:46:31.970 --> 01:46:33.063
ORION: Oh.

01:46:33.063 --> 01:46:34.182
LAURA: This horn?

01:46:34.182 --> 01:46:35.034
ASHLEY: Yes.

01:46:35.034 --> 01:46:36.084
MARISHA: Concentrated evil.

01:46:36.084 --> 01:46:37.342
ORION: Nasty horn.

01:46:37.342 --> 01:46:44.048
ASHLEY: And it was so strong that I couldn't stay
in the vision, because I could feel that it was

01:46:44.048 --> 01:46:51.268
taking over, so I pulled me out of the dream,
among various things. But I saw--

01:46:51.268 --> 01:46:53.746
MARISHA: Like the horn of Sauron?

01:46:53.746 --> 01:46:55.261
ASHLEY: The horn of Sauron, is what it said.

01:46:55.261 --> 01:46:58.340
ORION: Is that your cousin?

01:46:58.340 --> 01:46:59.694
LIAM: Did you see any whales?

01:46:59.694 --> 01:47:00.635
LAURA: The horn of--

01:47:00.635 --> 01:47:01.825
ASHLEY: I didn't see whales.

01:47:01.825 --> 01:47:02.639
LIAM: No whales.

01:47:02.639 --> 01:47:03.572
LAURA: Okay, no narwhals.

01:47:03.572 --> 01:47:04.676
MARISHA: No whales, no narwhals.

01:47:04.676 --> 01:47:06.600
LAURA: The horn of K'varn, yes?

01:47:06.600 --> 01:47:07.419
ASHLEY: Yes.

01:47:07.419 --> 01:47:08.513
LAURA: Okay.

01:47:08.513 --> 01:47:09.930
MARISHA: Horn of evil.

01:47:09.930 --> 01:47:14.812
ASHLEY: I some visions of where sort of-- 'Cause I
kind of went in past and then got to this thing.

01:47:14.812 --> 01:47:18.538
So I guess depending on where we are--

01:47:18.538 --> 01:47:20.870
LAURA: Can you lead in the direction to go?

01:47:20.870 --> 01:47:23.860
ASHLEY: Yes, if I see things that are familiar.
Such as--

01:47:23.860 --> 01:47:26.697
(all laugh)

01:47:26.697 --> 01:47:34.738
ASHLEY: I went past a jagged onyx-colored fortress
framed in molten rock.

01:47:34.738 --> 01:47:35.759
LIAM: Oh.

01:47:35.759 --> 01:47:36.754
LAURA: I think that probably--

01:47:36.754 --> 01:47:37.801
MARISHA: The place we're heading.

01:47:37.801 --> 01:47:38.588
LAURA: The place we're going to.

01:47:38.588 --> 01:47:39.196
ASHLEY: Yes.

01:47:39.196 --> 01:47:40.190
LIAM: That sounds creepy

01:47:40.190 --> 01:47:43.320
ASHLEY: Past a field of broken glass and bone.

01:47:43.320 --> 01:47:44.134
ORION: Right.

01:47:44.134 --> 01:47:45.424
MARISHA: We haven't seen that. Oh no.

01:47:45.424 --> 01:47:46.466
TRAVIS: Obsidian, maybe?

01:47:46.466 --> 01:47:47.527
ASHLEY: Yeah.

01:47:47.527 --> 01:47:48.755
TALIESIN: Or just melted sand.

01:47:48.755 --> 01:47:50.119
TRAVIS: I mean, whatever that is.

01:47:50.119 --> 01:47:59.196
ASHLEY: And the prettiest was into a cavern of
blue crystal, where a fungal fortress--

01:47:59.196 --> 01:48:00.401
LAURA: A fungal fortress?

01:48:00.401 --> 01:48:01.421
MARISHA: Ooh.

01:48:01.421 --> 01:48:03.270
ASHLEY: -- sort of entwined an ancient city of
marble and jade--

01:48:03.270 --> 01:48:04.502
ORION: Three different places.

01:48:04.502 --> 01:48:05.698
LIAM: That sounds really shitty.

01:48:05.698 --> 01:48:07.077
LAURA: Did the blue gemstones look valuable?

01:48:07.077 --> 01:48:08.322
MARISHA: It sounds amazing, that doesn't sound
shitty.

01:48:08.322 --> 01:48:10.690
MATT: As you start to mention that now, Clarota
kind of nods and says,

01:48:10.690 --> 01:48:11.849
LIAM: It feels a bit-- broken glass.

01:48:11.849 --> 01:48:15.943
MATT: "Aye, that's where the colony resides."

01:48:15.943 --> 01:48:17.189
LAURA: Your colony?

01:48:17.189 --> 01:48:18.546
MATT: "Our great city."

01:48:18.546 --> 01:48:19.995
LIAM: In which of those places? In the--

01:48:19.995 --> 01:48:21.349
LAURA: In the fungal city.

01:48:21.349 --> 01:48:22.453
LIAM: Fungal.

01:48:22.453 --> 01:48:24.597
MATT: "Amongst the ruins of jade and glass."

01:48:24.597 --> 01:48:25.772
LAURA: (whispers) Jade.

01:48:25.772 --> 01:48:26.878
ORION: Is that where we should go?

01:48:26.878 --> 01:48:28.599
MARISHA: That's Yug'Voril?

01:48:28.599 --> 01:48:29.802
MATT: "Surrounded by the forest."

01:48:29.802 --> 01:48:31.089
MARISHA: That's Yug'Voril?

01:48:31.089 --> 01:48:38.584
MATT: "The city below Yug'Voril, that is where the
temple resides,

01:48:38.584 --> 01:48:43.023
"where K'varn holds the Elder Brain."

01:48:43.023 --> 01:48:44.207
LAURA: Ah.

01:48:44.207 --> 01:48:45.962
ORION: Ah, this is where we need to go, I'm
assuming.

01:48:45.962 --> 01:48:46.829
MATT: "Ah, yes."

01:48:46.829 --> 01:48:48.729
LIAM: He sounds like a real fun-guy.

01:48:48.729 --> 01:48:49.531
TRAVIS: Oh god.

01:48:49.531 --> 01:48:51.334
(all groan)

01:48:51.334 --> 01:48:52.601
TALIESIN: Trip him again, trip him again.

01:48:52.601 --> 01:48:53.853
MARISHA: Trip him again!

01:48:53.853 --> 01:48:54.834
LIAM: I'm a dad.

01:48:54.834 --> 01:48:56.609
(all laugh)

01:48:56.609 --> 01:48:57.732
LAURA: So I bet the fortress--

01:48:57.732 --> 01:48:59.062
MATT: Make a will saving throw.

01:48:59.062 --> 01:49:00.695
(all laugh)

01:49:00.695 --> 01:49:03.376
ASHLEY: Oh my god.

01:49:03.376 --> 01:49:04.638
LIAM: What is that? Wisdom?

01:49:04.638 --> 01:49:05.308
MATT: Yes.

01:49:05.308 --> 01:49:06.574
LIAM: 12.

01:49:06.574 --> 01:49:13.754
MATT: Okay, you feel a mental slap as Clarota
glares at you from across the tunnel.

01:49:13.754 --> 01:49:18.958
"There'll be none of that in my presence."

01:49:18.958 --> 01:49:21.458
TRAVIS: You got bitch-slapped.

01:49:21.458 --> 01:49:24.209
MATT: "I hate puns."

01:49:24.209 --> 01:49:25.816
(all laugh)

01:49:25.816 --> 01:49:28.395
TRAVIS: (high-pitched voice) I hate puns.

01:49:28.395 --> 01:49:29.827
LIAM: Noted, noted.

01:49:29.827 --> 01:49:35.388
LAURA: So I bet, first fortress you saw, I bet the
one of obsidian was where--

01:49:35.388 --> 01:49:38.430
LIAM: Percy's losing his shit.

01:49:38.430 --> 01:49:42.197
ORION: There's a bathroom right over there,
Percy.

01:49:42.208 --> 01:49:43.787
LAURA: -- where Lady Kima is being held.

01:49:43.787 --> 01:49:44.762
ASHLEY: I think--

01:49:44.762 --> 01:49:48.447
LAURA: I bet that's the one, because he mentioned
molten lava or something. So she's being held

01:49:48.447 --> 01:49:50.500
there and then further in is K'varn.

01:49:50.500 --> 01:49:51.346
ASHLEY: Yeah.

01:49:51.346 --> 01:49:53.351
ORION: So get there, get K'varn.

01:49:53.351 --> 01:49:56.492
MATT: "Yes, Emberhold, yes."

01:49:56.492 --> 01:49:58.225
LAURA: Emberhold, yes. Is that an obsidian
fortress?

01:49:58.225 --> 01:50:00.814
MATT: "It is black and jagged, I think, yes."

01:50:00.814 --> 01:50:03.481
LAURA: Well, let's keep going that way.

01:50:03.481 --> 01:50:05.653
MARISHA: So the ultimate question is, are we
heading the right way? Are we heading the right

01:50:05.653 --> 01:50:07.842
way, Pike, do you know?

01:50:07.842 --> 01:50:09.585
ASHLEY: Can I perception check?

01:50:09.585 --> 01:50:11.608
(all laugh)

01:50:11.608 --> 01:50:16.403
MATT: You guys are unfamiliar with this tunnel,
Clarota is unfamiliar with this tunnel. All you

01:50:16.403 --> 01:50:19.526
know is it's going down. That's better than up.

01:50:19.526 --> 01:50:20.915
ASHLEY: I feel like that's the way we need to go.

01:50:20.915 --> 01:50:22.265
LAURA: So, just keep going, then?

01:50:22.265 --> 01:50:23.478
TALIESIN: Let's keep going.

01:50:23.478 --> 01:50:24.856
TRAVIS: Do I need to take off running again?

01:50:24.856 --> 01:50:25.812
LAURA: No.

01:50:25.812 --> 01:50:29.306
ASHLEY: I think basically we need to go down,
'cause if we go up that means we're going out.

01:50:29.306 --> 01:50:30.814
LAURA: Yeah, let's keep going.

01:50:30.814 --> 01:50:32.169
TRAVIS: We can go--

01:50:32.169 --> 01:50:41.909
MATT: You guys press forward and you begin to
encounter little trickles on the ceiling of

01:50:41.909 --> 01:50:45.435
orange, glowing little puddles.

01:50:45.435 --> 01:50:47.285
LAURA: Avoid that!

01:50:47.285 --> 01:50:49.636
MARISHA: If we learned anything from Minecraft--

01:50:49.636 --> 01:50:51.486
(all laugh)

01:50:51.486 --> 01:50:53.090
LAURA: Don't touch that.

01:50:53.090 --> 01:51:01.136
MATT: Progressing further down, you start seeing
large clusters, little pools of molten rock

01:51:01.206 --> 01:51:10.726
beginning to form under certain sections. In a
little ways up, you begin hearing some additional

01:51:10.726 --> 01:51:13.727
footsteps to your own. Further down the tunnel.

01:51:13.727 --> 01:51:17.718
LAURA: Oh. Can we stealth, can we stealth? And my
favored terrain is the Underdark.

01:51:17.718 --> 01:51:18.919
MATT: It is.

01:51:18.919 --> 01:51:20.808
LAURA: I don't know what that means, though.

01:51:20.808 --> 01:51:22.343
(all laugh)

01:51:22.343 --> 01:51:25.065
LAURA: No, no, no, I know. But I don't know what
favored terrain gives me, because I tried to look

01:51:25.065 --> 01:51:26.506
it up and couldn't find it.

01:51:26.506 --> 01:51:27.769
ASHLEY: You just love it.

01:51:27.769 --> 01:51:29.384
LAURA: Does it give me an advantage?

01:51:29.384 --> 01:51:32.523
MATT: Here, there's a sheet that has all the
information you need.

01:51:32.523 --> 01:51:35.088
LAURA: Oh good, thank you.

01:51:35.088 --> 01:51:40.691
ORION: By the way, I take one of the earrings from
Scanlan and give it to Grog.

01:51:40.691 --> 01:51:42.760
So Grog, now you've got one of the--

01:51:42.760 --> 01:51:43.964
TRAVIS: I've got an earring?

01:51:43.964 --> 01:51:47.371
MATT: Scanlan is not happy about this.

01:51:47.371 --> 01:51:50.031
ORION: Well? He's not saying anything.

01:51:50.031 --> 01:51:55.134
LIAM: Everyone, there's footsteps coming from
ahead. Let Vex'ahlia and I scout ahead.

01:51:55.134 --> 01:51:56.687
Wait for a moment.

01:51:56.687 --> 01:51:58.719
LAURA: Yes, okay. Let's go.

01:51:58.719 --> 01:52:00.447
MATT: Stealth checks, both of you.

01:52:00.447 --> 01:52:04.078
LAURA: Yes, finally.

01:52:04.078 --> 01:52:05.215
LIAM: 22 for me.

01:52:05.215 --> 01:52:06.882
MATT: All right.

01:52:06.882 --> 01:52:12.179
LAURA: The same for me, actually. Twinsies.
Sorry.

01:52:12.179 --> 01:52:15.275
MATT: All right, so you guys vanish into the
darkness best as you can tell, kind of weaving

01:52:15.275 --> 01:52:20.528
between the portions of the tunnel that naturally
shift and give you moments where you can hide up

01:52:20.528 --> 01:52:25.284
inside. As you guys hold back, you guys push
ahead, and you can see the little points of

01:52:25.284 --> 01:52:32.454
glowing light where these lava pools every 100 or
so feet begin to appear. You begin listening out,

01:52:32.454 --> 01:52:38.961
and you hear these footfalls are very heavy, and
the gait of whoever is walking seems to be wider

01:52:38.961 --> 01:52:41.471
than that of the normal humanoid.

01:52:41.538 --> 01:52:43.650
TRAVIS: Ah, let me play. Please.

01:52:43.650 --> 01:52:47.372
LIAM: Well it's definitely not duergar. How far
ahead of us do they sound?

01:52:47.372 --> 01:52:49.188
LAURA: Can we see it?

01:52:49.188 --> 01:52:53.670
MATT: Probably a good 60, 70 feet. You hear some
muttering.

01:52:53.670 --> 01:52:56.194
LAURA: Can I understand what they're saying?

01:52:56.194 --> 01:52:57.308
MATT: No.

01:52:57.308 --> 01:53:01.585
LIAM: I'm listening, trying to make out how many
sets of footsteps I can hear.

01:53:01.585 --> 01:53:05.488
LAURA: And I look on the ground and see if I can
find multiple sets of footsteps as well.

01:53:05.488 --> 01:53:08.193
MATT: Looking on the ground, you guys have no
light source currently. It's pitch black.

01:53:08.193 --> 01:53:10.847
LIAM: But there's lava spilling and we can see in
dim light.

01:53:10.847 --> 01:53:19.683
MATT: Do you want to go to the nearest lava pool?
All right. It's very, very faint visual. You can

01:53:19.683 --> 01:53:23.552
see there are a number of tracks, up and down. All
different sizes. This area, this tunnel is

01:53:23.552 --> 01:53:35.033
traversed quite a lot. Listening, you hear two
sets of heavy footsteps. And you hear what sounds

01:53:35.033 --> 01:53:39.177
like some sort of squeak sound, like a (squeaks).

01:53:39.177 --> 01:53:41.994
TRAVIS: Shit.

01:53:41.994 --> 01:53:44.363
LIAM: Cart. Could be some sort of device--

01:53:44.363 --> 01:53:53.160
MATT: From around the edge, you can just barely
make out these two lumbering humanoid shapes.

01:53:53.160 --> 01:53:56.272
LIAM: Can we tell what they are?

01:53:56.272 --> 01:53:57.925
LAURA: Oh, he's trying to see if they're seeing
us.

01:53:57.925 --> 01:53:59.010
LIAM: Yes.

01:53:59.010 --> 01:54:01.932
MATT: They begin to step towards your direction.

01:54:01.932 --> 01:54:03.314
LAURA: We back away.

01:54:03.314 --> 01:54:05.004
MATT: You guys back and kind of flatten yourself
against the wall.

01:54:05.004 --> 01:54:08.008
LIAM: Separate sides.

01:54:08.008 --> 01:54:15.104
MATT: You can see they're now both dragging behind
them this small roughshod cart,

01:54:15.104 --> 01:54:22.280
with something inside it.

01:54:22.280 --> 01:54:24.819
LAURA: We string a rope across the tunnel.

01:54:24.819 --> 01:54:26.171
MATT: Okay, you pull it across.

01:54:26.171 --> 01:54:27.562
MARISHA: Oh, yeah!

01:54:27.562 --> 01:54:32.559
MATT: (deep grumbling and laughter)

01:54:32.559 --> 01:54:36.548
LIAM: I also yank my serpentine belt off--

01:54:36.548 --> 01:54:38.167
LAURA: Oh!

01:54:38.215 --> 01:54:40.663
LIAM: And throw it out, right under the rope.

01:54:40.663 --> 01:54:41.779
MATT: Okay.

01:54:41.779 --> 01:54:42.825
LAURA: What does that do?

01:54:42.825 --> 01:54:43.685
LIAM: Snake.

01:54:43.685 --> 01:54:47.526
MATT: So, as he throws the leather, the leather
shifts form suddenly in midair into a serpent that

01:54:47.526 --> 01:54:51.534
slips onto the ground, and slithers 
in place, curling up at

01:54:51.612 --> 01:54:53.188
the approaching two monolithic entities.

01:54:53.188 --> 01:54:54.152
LAURA: That is stupid.

01:54:54.152 --> 01:54:55.142
LIAM: Yes, it is.

01:54:55.142 --> 01:54:57.934
LAURA: This is gonna go really poorly.

01:54:57.934 --> 01:55:01.040
MATT: As they begin to cross in front of you, you
both pull taut on the rope.

01:55:01.040 --> 01:55:02.067
LAURA: This is dumb.

01:55:02.067 --> 01:55:11.044
MATT: The immediate one falls forward, tripping
face-first on the ground, a heavy (impact sound).

01:55:11.044 --> 01:55:13.644
You guys hear in the distance this loud thud,
impact sound.

01:55:13.644 --> 01:55:16.472
LAURA: And we call, I go, Grog!

01:55:16.472 --> 01:55:17.871
TRAVIS: I'm raging.

01:55:17.871 --> 01:55:20.719
LIAM: And I leap out, daggers at the fallen one.

01:55:20.719 --> 01:55:21.631
MATT: All right.

01:55:21.631 --> 01:55:22.769
MARISHA: Run!

01:55:22.769 --> 01:55:24.274
MATT: You guys come rushing in, let's go ahead and
roll initiative.

01:55:24.343 --> 01:55:25.372
TALIESIN: Yeah!

01:55:25.372 --> 01:55:27.013
TRAVIS: I raged.

01:55:27.220 --> 01:55:28.431
MATT: I figured you were raging.

01:55:28.431 --> 01:55:31.401
TRAVIS: Well, you know, when the ladies call my
name.

01:55:31.401 --> 01:55:33.472
TALIESIN: That sucks.

01:55:33.472 --> 01:55:36.659
MARISHA: That's not too bad, could be worse.

01:55:36.659 --> 01:55:40.152
ORION: Yes, sounds good.

01:55:40.152 --> 01:55:41.893
MARISHA: What are we fighting? What are we
fighting?

01:55:41.893 --> 01:55:43.489
LAURA: I know, right? Oh god, here we go.

01:55:43.489 --> 01:55:45.308
MARISHA: What are we fighting, we don't know.

01:55:45.308 --> 01:55:46.325
LAURA: Oh! Lava pools.

01:55:46.325 --> 01:55:47.292
TALIESIN: Lava pools.

01:55:47.292 --> 01:55:48.901
MARISHA: Lava pools, Lava pools.

01:55:48.901 --> 01:55:49.952
TRAVIS: Wow.

01:55:49.952 --> 01:55:51.062
ASHLEY: Wow.

01:55:51.062 --> 01:55:53.613
MARISHA: Grog, you better be throwing bitches into
that lava.

01:55:53.613 --> 01:56:00.181
TRAVIS: Last time I tried to do somebody
to something, I did it to myself, so.

01:56:00.181 --> 01:56:01.652
LIAM: Hashtag bitches in lava?

01:56:01.652 --> 01:56:03.022
MARISHA: Hashtag bitches in lava!

01:56:03.022 --> 01:56:04.271
MATT: You guys, coming in this way.

01:56:04.271 --> 01:56:07.053
MARISHA: Bitches in lava, bitches in lava.

01:56:07.053 --> 01:56:10.516
ASHLEY and LAURA: Oh god!

01:56:10.516 --> 01:56:13.969
ORION: She's excited about the lava.

01:56:13.969 --> 01:56:16.806
LIAM: I got 99 problems and a troll ain't one.

01:56:16.806 --> 01:56:18.281
LAURA: Are they trolls, are they ogres?

01:56:18.281 --> 01:56:20.812
MATT: They are two giant ogres.

01:56:20.812 --> 01:56:22.095
LAURA: Oh, god, one's on the ground.

01:56:22.095 --> 01:56:23.240
TRAVIS: Oh, shit.

01:56:23.240 --> 01:56:25.413
LAURA: It's huge, these are really big.

01:56:25.413 --> 01:56:27.154
MATT: One is back here and one's just fallen over
there.

01:56:27.154 --> 01:56:28.487
ASHLEY: Holy cow.

01:56:28.487 --> 01:56:34.490
MATT: And they are carrying some sort of large
cart-like object, I'll just say for now.

01:56:34.490 --> 01:56:36.295
LAURA: This is so dumb, why did we do this?

01:56:36.295 --> 01:56:38.090
TALIESIN: This is a d20.

01:56:38.090 --> 01:56:43.416
MATT: Let's say it's about there. All right.

01:56:43.416 --> 01:56:44.939
TRAVIS: What's in the cart?

01:56:44.939 --> 01:56:46.510
MATT: So, initiative order, guys?

01:56:46.510 --> 01:56:48.091
LAURA: Do we get the surprise at all?

01:56:48.091 --> 01:56:51.741
MATT: You do, actually! I'm rolling initiative, so
we have the order. You guys are gonna have a full

01:56:51.741 --> 01:56:53.545
round of surprise on them first.

01:56:53.545 --> 01:56:55.027
LAURA: Okay, cool.

01:56:55.027 --> 01:56:58.094
MATT: All right, so, 25 to 20?

01:56:58.094 --> 01:56:59.160
LAURA: Oh, man, really?

01:56:59.160 --> 01:57:00.018
MATT: 20 to 15?

01:57:00.018 --> 01:57:00.874
ORION: 19.

01:57:00.874 --> 01:57:01.545
LAURA: 15.

01:57:01.545 --> 01:57:02.407
LIAM: 15.

01:57:04.597 --> 01:57:09.297
ORION: I got scared and I cast Stoneskin
immediately.

01:57:09.363 --> 01:57:10.966
ASHLEY: Cast what?

01:57:10.966 --> 01:57:12.131
ORION: Stoneskin.

01:57:12.131 --> 01:57:14.174
MATT: So Vex and Vax, both at 15?

01:57:14.174 --> 01:57:14.924
LAURA: Yeah.

01:57:14.924 --> 01:57:15.762
LIAM: 15, yeah.

01:57:15.762 --> 01:57:16.861
LIAM and LAURA: Oh!

01:57:16.861 --> 01:57:17.975
MATT: 15 to ten?

01:57:17.975 --> 01:57:18.800
TALIESIN: 13.

01:57:18.800 --> 01:57:19.917
MARISHA: 13 as well.

01:57:19.917 --> 01:57:22.238
ASHLEY: 11.

01:57:22.238 --> 01:57:24.333
LAURA: Oh no, Grog, what did you roll?

01:57:24.333 --> 01:57:29.489
TRAVIS: I farted when I rolled, I rolled a 9.

01:57:29.489 --> 01:57:31.251
MATT: Oh! Grog.

01:57:31.251 --> 01:57:34.979
ASHLEY: Greg.

01:57:35.047 --> 01:57:38.670
ORION: How much does the ogre weigh? Or the ogres,
as you said?

01:57:38.670 --> 01:57:42.828
MATT: The ogres, each one weighs nearly a ton.

01:57:42.828 --> 01:57:44.190
TRAVIS: Oh, shit, really?

01:57:44.190 --> 01:57:46.036
LAURA: Oh, they're huge.

01:57:46.036 --> 01:57:47.928
TRAVIS: So, like, 200 pounds.

01:57:47.928 --> 01:57:52.003
MATT and LIAM: Yes.

01:57:52.003 --> 01:57:53.344
LIAM: Yes, exactly.

01:57:53.344 --> 01:57:54.343
MATT: Yes, Grog, close to that.

01:57:54.343 --> 01:57:56.688
LAURA: Yes, Grog.

01:57:56.688 --> 01:58:06.306
MATT: All right, let's go fast here. Here we go.
All right, so, top of the round-- No! Surprise

01:58:06.306 --> 01:58:08.753
round for both of you guys first, as the rest 
of you rush in, so Vex and Vax,

01:58:08.873 --> 01:58:10.220
you guys get a surprise round.

01:58:10.220 --> 01:58:11.082
LAURA: Awesome.

01:58:11.082 --> 01:58:12.443
LIAM: I'm already jumping in the air, so I'm gonna
go.

01:58:12.443 --> 01:58:13.619
MATT: To the guy on the ground.

01:58:13.619 --> 01:58:18.511
LIAM: Okay, and this, since it's a surprise, it's
automatic crit?

01:58:18.511 --> 01:58:19.431
MATT: Yes!

01:58:19.431 --> 01:58:20.693
LAURA: Oh, nice.

01:58:20.693 --> 01:58:21.481
MARISHA: Hell, yeah!

01:58:21.481 --> 01:58:23.346
MATT: He's on the ground, so you get advantage on
your attack rolls.

01:58:23.543 --> 01:58:27.429
LIAM: Okay, okay, all right, so that's 28.

01:58:27.429 --> 01:58:28.937
MATT: That definitively hits.

01:58:28.937 --> 01:58:38.217
LIAM: Yeah, 1d4 for-- this is my poison dagger.
Two, eight, okay, I'm doing my Sneak Attack

01:58:38.217 --> 01:58:54.280
damage, here we go, four, nine, 12, 18, yeah, 23.
Total for that, 62 points of damage.

01:58:54.280 --> 01:58:55.769
MATT: 62 points of damage.

01:58:55.769 --> 01:58:59.705
LAURA: Wow.

01:58:59.705 --> 01:59:05.154
MATT: You leap on and entirely eviscerate the
ogre. You jumped onto his back, slashing the back

01:59:05.154 --> 01:59:11.812
of his torso. As you pull open the flesh, you
expose the back of the ribcage, and he goes into

01:59:11.812 --> 01:59:15.277
this kind of gurgling sound as it dies immediately
on the spot.

01:59:15.277 --> 01:59:17.195
LAURA, MARISHA and ASHLEY: Oh, what?

01:59:17.195 --> 01:59:22.131
LIAM: And I use my bonus action to hide.

01:59:22.131 --> 01:59:24.007
MATT: Okay.

01:59:24.007 --> 01:59:27.065
TRAVIS: Do you wanna talk to the other one, since--

01:59:27.065 --> 01:59:28.296
LAURA: 62.

01:59:28.296 --> 01:59:31.510
MATT: Okay, roll and make a stealth check.

01:59:31.510 --> 01:59:33.133
LIAM: Natural 20.

01:59:33.133 --> 01:59:33.941
ORION: Nice.

01:59:33.941 --> 01:59:34.908
MATT: All right.

01:59:34.908 --> 01:59:36.584
LIAM: See you later, motherfuckers.

01:59:36.584 --> 01:59:43.005
MATT: The ogre is right there. There is the ogre
on the ground, big squishy ogre.

01:59:43.005 --> 01:59:44.095
LAURA: What?

01:59:44.095 --> 01:59:45.935
TRAVIS: Big squishy ogre.

01:59:46.134 --> 01:59:48.289
MATT: It's considered rough terrain, because now
you have to go over this giant dead body in the

01:59:48.289 --> 01:59:50.737
middle of the-- All right, your turn.

01:59:50.737 --> 01:59:56.286
LAURA: I Hunter's Mark him, and I'm gonna shoot
him with the explosive arrow.

01:59:56.286 --> 01:59:57.323
TALIESIN: Yeah!

01:59:57.323 --> 01:59:58.627
TRAVIS: I like it.

01:59:58.627 --> 02:00:04.231
LAURA: So I'm gonna see if it hits. I'm gonna use
the blazing bowstring. That's a 22.

02:00:04.231 --> 02:00:06.339
MATT: 22 definitely hits.

02:00:06.339 --> 02:00:19.216
LAURA: Okay. Also, blazing bowstring that gives me
a plus d10. So, okay, 14 plus d10,

02:00:19.216 --> 02:00:20.851
wait, that's a ten? Yeah!

02:00:20.851 --> 02:00:21.974
LIAM: That's a ten.

02:00:21.974 --> 02:00:28.497
LAURA: Plus 19 and then Hunter's Mark! Plus six!

02:00:28.497 --> 02:00:29.884
LIAM: Ah yes!

02:00:29.884 --> 02:00:30.848
MATT: 25.

02:00:30.848 --> 02:00:32.159
LAURA: 25, plus whatever the explosive damage is.

02:00:32.159 --> 02:00:35.029
MATT: So! As you pull the arrow out, it's a little
wonky, it's actually, what you rolled, it's a

02:00:35.029 --> 02:00:39.164
minus four penalty to hit with it, but you still
manage to hit because it's a big creature, even

02:00:39.164 --> 02:00:43.903
though it's in very big darkness, you-- you know,
in darkness you ignore partial cover.

02:00:43.903 --> 02:00:44.968
LAURA: Right!

02:00:44.968 --> 02:00:46.204
LIAM: Bellybutton.

02:00:46.204 --> 02:00:52.177
MATT: You fire it. It arcs slightly, smacks in the
side of its chest and stomach area. It's this

02:00:52.246 --> 02:00:55.733
cacophonous explosion sound that rocks the
immediate vicinity.

02:00:55.733 --> 02:00:56.830
TALIESIN: Whoa! Yes!

02:00:56.830 --> 02:00:58.001
TRAVIS: Yes!

02:00:58.001 --> 02:00:59.842
MATT: It takes an additional 2d8 points of
explosive damage.

02:00:59.842 --> 02:01:00.780
MARISHA: Ooh!

02:01:00.780 --> 02:01:01.806
TALIESIN: Yeah!

02:01:01.806 --> 02:01:02.785
ORION: Nice.

02:01:02.785 --> 02:01:06.012
MATT: Nine points, and everything around it also
takes the additional damage--

02:01:06.012 --> 02:01:06.840
LAURA: Oh shit!

02:01:06.840 --> 02:01:08.135
MATT: -- the whole radius does.

02:01:08.135 --> 02:01:09.407
LAURA: Oh, I hope I didn't blow up the cart.

02:01:09.407 --> 02:01:14.529
MATT: The cart-- the wood on the wheels had
shatters and breaks, it falls to one side. What

02:01:14.529 --> 02:01:19.335
you see, some sort of a glass container that was
at the back of the cart shatters and cracks.

02:01:19.335 --> 02:01:20.762
LAURA: (gasps) Oh no.

02:01:20.762 --> 02:01:21.778
MARISHA: Oh.

02:01:21.778 --> 02:01:22.771
TALIESIN: I'm still happy.

02:01:22.771 --> 02:01:24.053
LAURA: Welp?

02:01:24.053 --> 02:01:25.526
LIAM: Still pretty cool, still pretty cool.

02:01:25.526 --> 02:01:26.998
MARISHA: Collateral damage. It's bound to happen.

02:01:26.998 --> 02:01:28.677
MATT: Top of the round. Tiberius.

02:01:28.677 --> 02:01:30.204
LAURA: Oh, and can I move away?

02:01:30.204 --> 02:01:31.471
MATT: You can move if you want. Yeah.

02:01:31.471 --> 02:01:32.860
LAURA: Yeah, I move back.

02:01:32.860 --> 02:01:34.216
MATT: Back to here?

02:01:34.216 --> 02:01:34.949
LAURA: Yeah. Sounds good.

02:01:34.949 --> 02:01:35.804
TRAVIS: Where's your pointer?

02:01:35.804 --> 02:01:36.752
MATT: Use your pointer if you need it.

02:01:36.752 --> 02:01:38.157
LAURA: Oh right! Well, there.

02:01:38.157 --> 02:01:40.569
MATT: All right. Tiberius, you're up first.

02:01:40.569 --> 02:01:45.068
ORION: Very good! I'll take a few steps forward
and be like, well, this is poppycock! And I'll

02:01:45.068 --> 02:01:48.786
shoot a Scorching Ray right at the dude.

02:01:48.786 --> 02:01:50.125
MATT: All right, go for it, roll for the attack.

02:01:50.125 --> 02:01:52.563
LAURA: Does anybody speak Ogre? Nobody speaks
Ogre, though. We can't talk to him.

02:01:52.563 --> 02:01:53.706
TRAVIS: No.

02:01:53.706 --> 02:01:54.870
LIAM: They're dumber than Grog is.

02:01:54.870 --> 02:01:56.012
ORION: So what am I rolling?

02:01:56.012 --> 02:01:58.281
MATT: Do you ignore partial cover?

02:01:58.281 --> 02:02:00.336
ORION: Oh! Like can I just in general?

02:02:00.336 --> 02:02:01.842
MATT: I mean, did you take that feat?

02:02:01.842 --> 02:02:02.700
ORION: No.

02:02:02.700 --> 02:02:09.053
MATT: No. Okay. So yeah. So you're rolling-- okay,
so yeah. So what did you roll to hit?

02:02:09.053 --> 02:02:12.503
ORION: I rolled all three at once. 'Cause I have
to do one for each.

02:02:12.503 --> 02:02:13.340
MATT: Right, yeah.

02:02:13.340 --> 02:02:15.474
ORION: So I got a 12, a 13, and a 12.

02:02:15.474 --> 02:02:18.106
MATT: Okay. All three rays unfortunately miss--

02:02:18.106 --> 02:02:18.915
ORION: Damn it!

02:02:18.915 --> 02:02:22.635
MATT: -- due to the darkness in this room it's
very hard to see, other than the slight glow from

02:02:22.635 --> 02:02:26.624
the lava. So you fire all three rays, and you see
them streak through, and each one gives off just

02:02:26.624 --> 02:02:30.723
enough light from the actual flaming ray to glow
to the vicinity, but not the actual target. You

02:02:30.723 --> 02:02:33.617
see them both streak off and slam the wall on the
opposite side.

02:02:33.617 --> 02:02:36.797
ORION: Wait, do I add my dex on those?

02:02:36.797 --> 02:02:39.458
MATT: You add your spell modifier.

02:02:39.458 --> 02:02:40.877
ORION: (whispers) What's my spell modifier?

02:02:40.877 --> 02:02:42.184
MATT: It's on top of your spell page!

02:02:42.184 --> 02:02:47.028
ORION: Oh! Oh, no, I'm sorry, 20-- plus nine on
all that.

02:02:47.028 --> 02:02:48.471
MATT: Good to know.

02:02:48.471 --> 02:02:49.475
ORION: Yeah, sorry.

02:02:49.475 --> 02:02:50.486
MATT: All three hit. Go ahead and roll damage.

02:02:50.486 --> 02:02:51.473
ORION: Okay.

02:02:51.473 --> 02:02:53.344
MATT: There you go.

02:02:53.344 --> 02:02:57.834
ORION: Okay, first one does five--

02:02:57.834 --> 02:03:00.136
MATT: It's his first time casting spells, guys.
(mouths) It's not.

02:03:00.136 --> 02:03:01.893
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:03:01.893 --> 02:03:03.013
ORION: -- plus five, ten! I rarely do this one,
kids.

02:03:03.013 --> 02:03:04.153
LIAM: It's part of his charm.

02:03:04.153 --> 02:03:05.001
ORION: Ten on the first one.

02:03:05.001 --> 02:03:06.679
MATT: All right.

02:03:06.679 --> 02:03:10.863
ORION: 17 on the second one. And 17 on the second
one.

02:03:10.863 --> 02:03:12.173
LAURA: He's so dead!

02:03:12.173 --> 02:03:13.259
MATT: Okay, is there a saving throw for half
damage?

02:03:13.259 --> 02:03:14.747
ORION: No! I mean, 12 on the third one.

02:03:14.747 --> 02:03:16.422
MATT: Is there a saving throw on this one, or is
it just straight damage?

02:03:16.422 --> 02:03:17.374
ORION: Yeah, straight damage.

02:03:17.374 --> 02:03:19.872
MATT: Okay, cool, gotcha. All right.

02:03:19.872 --> 02:03:21.112
ORION: Yes!

02:03:21.112 --> 02:03:25.980
MATT: All right, so you, you blast the ogre with
three. As each explosion hits, you see the

02:03:25.980 --> 02:03:31.855
rippling of its kind of grotesque flesh from the
impact, the third one blasting off a portion of

02:03:31.855 --> 02:03:38.123
its shoulder, exposing this meaty bone and blood.
It gives out this horrible (roars) into the tunnel

02:03:38.123 --> 02:03:43.994
itself, causing just the atmosphere to shake, as
bits of stone begin to rumble and fall from the

02:03:43.994 --> 02:03:48.562
ceiling. All right, that ends your turn?

02:03:48.562 --> 02:03:49.965
ORION: Yeah!

02:03:49.965 --> 02:03:53.311
MATT: Still standing. Barely. It's now its turn.

02:03:53.311 --> 02:03:55.245
LAURA: (gasps)

02:03:55.245 --> 02:03:56.858
MATT: It steps away.

02:03:56.858 --> 02:04:00.504
LIAM: (whispers) You can't see me.

02:04:00.504 --> 02:04:03.471
LAURA: Over the dead body of his brethren.

02:04:03.471 --> 02:04:05.706
MATT: To that point. It's just going to charge
through,

02:04:05.706 --> 02:04:13.551
as all it can see is the figures in the distance.

02:04:13.551 --> 02:04:14.670
MARISHA: Pick me.

02:04:14.670 --> 02:04:22.165
MATT: That's where it is. At which point, the cart
seems to shift slightly.

02:04:22.165 --> 02:04:23.061
TRAVIS: Oh shit.

02:04:23.061 --> 02:04:24.274
LAURA: Oh no, what did we do?

02:04:24.274 --> 02:04:25.923
LIAM: Oh dear, something's coming out of the jar.

02:04:25.923 --> 02:04:27.204
MARISHA: What did we open?

02:04:27.204 --> 02:04:28.204
LAURA: Oh, god. We let something out.

02:04:28.204 --> 02:04:29.776
MATT: You can see something slowly-- dark
something--

02:04:29.776 --> 02:04:30.931
ORION: I thought it was going to be a good thing!

02:04:30.931 --> 02:04:33.279
MATT: -- amorphous and liquid in nature beginning
to shift in the shadow.

02:04:33.279 --> 02:04:34.240
MARISHA: Oh, great.

02:04:34.240 --> 02:04:35.716
LAURA: Does it-- Oh no-- Is it on fire so we can
see--

02:04:35.716 --> 02:04:36.613
LIAM: No.

02:04:36.613 --> 02:04:37.822
LAURA: -- is it on fire so we can see what it is?

02:04:37.822 --> 02:04:38.517
MATT: No.

02:04:38.517 --> 02:04:39.198
LIAM: No.

02:04:39.198 --> 02:04:39.854
TALIESIN: Oh my god!

02:04:39.854 --> 02:04:40.771
LAURA: The cart wasn't on fire?

02:04:40.771 --> 02:04:41.563
LIAM: It's dangerous! It's dangerous! It's fucking
dangerous!

02:04:41.563 --> 02:04:42.495
MATT: It's just this giant, black, liquid--

02:04:42.495 --> 02:04:43.268
MARISHA: What is that?

02:04:43.268 --> 02:04:43.975
MATT: -- ooze-like creature.

02:04:43.975 --> 02:04:45.526
LIAM: It's black ooze. It's dangerous!

02:04:45.526 --> 02:04:46.667
MARISHA: We just opened Pandora's box.

02:04:46.667 --> 02:04:47.595
LAURA: This is really, really bad!

02:04:47.595 --> 02:04:48.781
LIAM: It's fucking dangerous.

02:04:48.781 --> 02:04:49.995
LAURA: I'm sorry I exploded it.

02:04:49.995 --> 02:04:51.618
MARISHA: Great. That's good. Good.

02:04:51.618 --> 02:04:53.223
LIAM: Stay away from it. Stay away from it. Stay
away from it.

02:04:53.223 --> 02:04:55.240
TRAVIS: So go wrestle it?

02:04:55.240 --> 02:04:56.424
ASHLEY: So go jump in it, is what you're saying.

02:04:56.424 --> 02:04:57.845
LIAM: French kiss that shit!

02:04:57.845 --> 02:04:58.868
TRAVIS: It's mine!

02:04:58.868 --> 02:05:00.219
LAURA: (whispers) Don't attack it.

02:05:00.219 --> 02:05:01.132
TRAVIS: Don't attack it?

02:05:01.132 --> 02:05:02.384
LAURA: I'm scared of it.

02:05:02.589 --> 02:05:03.111
MARISHA: Black ooze.

02:05:03.111 --> 02:05:04.174
LIAM: Ranged attacks.

02:05:04.174 --> 02:05:04.904
MATT: All right.

02:05:04.904 --> 02:05:05.976
LAURA: What does a black ooze do?

02:05:05.976 --> 02:05:06.793
LIAM: Fire and ranged attacks.

02:05:06.793 --> 02:05:07.659
MARISHA: How do I handle that?

02:05:07.659 --> 02:05:08.410
MATT: So! That brings us to--

02:05:08.410 --> 02:05:10.071
TALIESIN: Fire?

02:05:10.071 --> 02:05:10.894
LIAM: Think!

02:05:10.894 --> 02:05:12.351
MATT: Scanlan. Scanlan.

02:05:12.351 --> 02:05:13.391
LAURA: Oh no, oh god, Scanlan.

02:05:13.391 --> 02:05:15.142
MATT: I know you're out there, Scanlan.

02:05:15.142 --> 02:05:16.105
LAURA: Do something amazing, Scanlan!

02:05:16.105 --> 02:05:17.294
LIAM: Sing, Sam! Sing!

02:05:17.294 --> 02:05:22.004
MATT: Scanlan's going to go ahead and sing a song
of inspiration to--

02:05:22.004 --> 02:05:23.584
I'd say Grog just in case he needs to-

02:05:23.584 --> 02:05:26.136
TALIESIN: (sings) When we have to fight the ooze,
you'll never have to lose.

02:05:26.136 --> 02:05:26.870
TRAVIS: What?

02:05:26.870 --> 02:05:27.836
LAURA: You received an inspiration.

02:05:27.836 --> 02:05:28.771
TRAVIS: Oh good, yeah, thank you. It's an eight,
right?

02:05:28.771 --> 02:05:30.866
MATT: Yeah, it's a d8 inspiration dice.

02:05:30.866 --> 02:05:32.230
LAURA: I want some food. I'm so hungry.

02:05:32.230 --> 02:05:34.479
LIAM: (sings) We're up all night in the dark,
we're up all night in the dark.

02:05:34.479 --> 02:05:36.540
TALIESIN and MARISHA: (sing) We're up all night in
the dark.

02:05:36.540 --> 02:05:37.863
ORION: Is that what Sam would do?

02:05:37.863 --> 02:05:42.259
MATT: Scanlan is then going to cast Invisibility
on himself

02:05:42.259 --> 02:05:46.119
as an immediate self-sustaining reaction.

02:05:46.119 --> 02:05:47.749
LIAM: Oh shit, the music! The music!

02:05:47.749 --> 02:05:49.185
MATT: That brings us to Vex!

02:05:49.185 --> 02:05:51.086
LAURA: Me?

02:05:51.086 --> 02:05:52.029
MATT: Yes.

02:05:52.029 --> 02:05:53.154
LIAM: Ranged attack, ranged attack.

02:05:53.154 --> 02:05:54.077
LAURA: Okay, on the thingie?

02:05:54.077 --> 02:05:55.088
MARISHA: Pew pew.

02:05:55.088 --> 02:05:56.261
ORION: Take out the ogre first.

02:05:56.261 --> 02:06:00.941
LAURA: Okay. Well I'm gonna Lightning Bolt the
black ooze!

02:06:01.146 --> 02:06:02.705
MATT: Okay.

02:06:02.705 --> 02:06:03.724
LIAM: Sounds good.

02:06:03.724 --> 02:06:05.704
LAURA: Okay. Which--

02:06:05.704 --> 02:06:06.951
MATT: So you Lightning Arrow.

02:06:06.951 --> 02:06:09.686
LAURA: Yes, I do.

02:06:09.686 --> 02:06:11.157
Okay.

02:06:11.241 --> 02:06:15.601
Oh, and, oh, the other-- never mind, that
other guy's still Hunter's Marked. Okay.

02:06:15.601 --> 02:06:16.627
MARISHA: Well, yeah.

02:06:16.627 --> 02:06:20.924
LIAM: Hit it, hit it, hit it.

02:06:20.924 --> 02:06:22.133
LAURA: Okay, that's good.

02:06:22.133 --> 02:06:22.960
LIAM: Yes, it is!

02:06:22.960 --> 02:06:25.082
LAURA: That's a 19 plus-- that's a regular attack
bonus, right?

02:06:25.082 --> 02:06:26.120
LIAM: It's a crit.

02:06:26.120 --> 02:06:27.621
LAURA: Was it?

02:06:27.621 --> 02:06:29.104
LIAM: Isn't 19-20 crit? That's just for me.

02:06:29.104 --> 02:06:30.021
MATT: No, that's just for you.

02:06:30.021 --> 02:06:31.090
LAURA: That's just for you, yo.

02:06:31.090 --> 02:06:31.880
MATT: Yeah, so that hits.

02:06:31.880 --> 02:06:33.120
LAURA: Okay. So.

02:06:33.120 --> 02:06:34.118
MARISHA: What if it's like a sentient alien
lifeform?

02:06:34.118 --> 02:06:35.391
ASHLEY: This music is so stressful!

02:06:35.391 --> 02:06:36.650
LAURA: Okay, 4d8 of lightning damage.

02:06:36.650 --> 02:06:37.594
MARISHA: You know, like some Spiderman shit.

02:06:37.594 --> 02:06:38.837
MATT: Go ahead and roll the arrow damage.

02:06:38.837 --> 02:06:40.177
MARISHA: Some alien lifeform shit.

02:06:40.177 --> 02:06:41.052
TALIESIN: Well, we should kill it.

02:06:41.052 --> 02:06:42.060
LAURA: Oh, okay.

02:06:42.060 --> 02:06:43.061
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:06:43.061 --> 02:06:47.016
LAURA: Just kidding, I'm just so excited! 11.

02:06:47.016 --> 02:06:48.220
MATT: Okay.

02:06:48.220 --> 02:06:53.902
LAURA: Okay. And the 4d8 of lightning damage.

02:06:53.902 --> 02:06:55.655
MATT: As the arrow disappears into its form--

02:06:55.655 --> 02:06:56.813
LAURA: No.

02:06:56.813 --> 02:06:59.927
MATT: -- the bolt of energy, as you pull out the
arrow and release it, it sparks and you can see

02:06:59.927 --> 02:07:04.973
the blue energy kind of streaking behind the
arrow. It plunges into this thick, black, gooey

02:07:04.973 --> 02:07:08.314
mass and as it does, the lightning just gets
absorbed into its form.

02:07:08.314 --> 02:07:09.655
TRAVIS: Oh, shit balls.

02:07:09.655 --> 02:07:14.201
MATT: It sits for a second, shakes and quivers,
and then splits.

02:07:14.201 --> 02:07:15.211
MARISHA: Oh! No.

02:07:15.211 --> 02:07:16.824
LAURA: Splits?

02:07:16.824 --> 02:07:18.409
LIAM: Yeah, it splits into smaller ones. Smaller
sizes.

02:07:18.409 --> 02:07:22.208
MATT: Dividing into two separate smaller slimes.

02:07:22.208 --> 02:07:23.387
TALIESIN: No!

02:07:23.387 --> 02:07:24.508
LAURA: What is this thing?

02:07:24.508 --> 02:07:28.899
MATT: Seemingly unaffected by the damage of the
lightning. Other than the fact that you altered

02:07:28.899 --> 02:07:30.424
its form slightly.

02:07:30.424 --> 02:07:32.329
LAURA: Great. Cool. Awesome.

02:07:32.329 --> 02:07:34.558
MATT: So, do you wish to move?

02:07:34.558 --> 02:07:42.408
LAURA: Oh, yeah! I back the eff up. Actually,
should-- yeah, yeah. I'm gonna back up.

02:07:42.408 --> 02:07:47.034
To there sounds good.

02:07:47.034 --> 02:07:48.668
MATT: All right!

02:07:48.668 --> 02:07:51.176
That brings us to-- Vax, you're up.

02:07:51.176 --> 02:07:57.446
LIAM: All right, I'm gonna run up to the back of
Tall and Ugly, and try to stab him. I'm gonna do

02:07:57.446 --> 02:07:59.915
the reach-around again, and try to stab him in the
eyes.

02:07:59.915 --> 02:08:01.707
ORION and ASHLEY: The ol' reach-around.

02:08:01.707 --> 02:08:04.682
LIAM: And I'm hidden-- I'm stealth already, I
think, right?

02:08:04.682 --> 02:08:05.607
ORION: Courteous!

02:08:05.607 --> 02:08:06.589
MATT: You are, yes.

02:08:06.589 --> 02:08:07.629
TRAVIS: It's like his character move.

02:08:07.629 --> 02:08:08.473
TALIESIN: The stealthy reach-around.

02:08:08.473 --> 02:08:09.629
TRAVIS: Action figure Vax'ahlia.

02:08:09.629 --> 02:08:11.083
LIAM: So the first attack is an 18.

02:08:11.083 --> 02:08:12.285
TALIESIN: The stealthy reach-around.

02:08:12.285 --> 02:08:13.193
LAURA: That's Vax'ildan.

02:08:13.193 --> 02:08:14.128
MATT: Hits.

02:08:14.128 --> 02:08:15.148
TRAVIS: Sorry. Vax'ildan.

02:08:15.148 --> 02:08:16.194
LIAM: Okay, Sneak Attack, here we go.

02:08:16.194 --> 02:08:17.428
TRAVIS: The signature reach-around move!

02:08:17.428 --> 02:08:28.208
LIAM: For the eyeballs. Two plus seven is--

02:08:28.208 --> 02:08:30.728
LAURA: I'm sorry I let the ooze loose.

02:08:30.940 --> 02:08:31.875
TALIESIN: It's okay.

02:08:31.875 --> 02:08:33.683
LIAM: 40. 52.

02:08:33.683 --> 02:08:39.535
MATT: 52. As you reach behind, the daggers plunge
into it, and the ogre lumbering over doesn't have

02:08:39.535 --> 02:08:45.249
any more to its life. Its jaw just goes slack as
it releases the last bit of air in its lungs,

02:08:45.249 --> 02:08:48.191
tumbling forward, piling onto his friend.

02:08:48.191 --> 02:08:52.520
LIAM: As it does, I want to use my bonus action to
spring off his shoulders towards my friends.

02:08:52.520 --> 02:08:54.815
MATT: Okay. Okay.

02:08:54.815 --> 02:08:56.246
LAURA: That's good.

02:08:56.246 --> 02:08:58.578
MATT: This direction? All right, go ahead and make
an acrobatics check.

02:08:58.578 --> 02:08:59.502
LIAM: Sure.

02:08:59.502 --> 02:09:00.718
LAURA: Over the lava pit.

02:09:00.718 --> 02:09:01.599
TRAVIS: Kill it.

02:09:01.599 --> 02:09:02.863
LAURA: Don't fall in the lava pit.

02:09:02.863 --> 02:09:04.467
LIAM: That's a 15.

02:09:04.467 --> 02:09:08.795
MATT: 15, okay. You barely manage to catch your
footing. Thank god you didn't roll a one. That

02:09:08.795 --> 02:09:13.666
would've been very bad. This ogre then plummets to
the ground, now piling on top of his friend.

02:09:13.666 --> 02:09:15.687
LAURA: Okay, that's good.

02:09:15.687 --> 02:09:19.266
MATT: So now that whole section there is
considered rough terrain.

02:09:19.266 --> 02:09:23.262
All right, that brings us to Percy!

02:09:23.262 --> 02:09:25.421
TALIESIN: Okay, I'm going to try something weird,
here.

02:09:25.421 --> 02:09:26.572
TRAVIS: Oh no.

02:09:26.572 --> 02:09:32.682
TALIESIN: Where am I? Okay. I'm going to step
forward and to the right a bit. Just sort of

02:09:32.682 --> 02:09:38.585
joining this little-- like getting right in here.
And I'm going to try and shoot, and this is gonna

02:09:38.585 --> 02:09:41.599
sound weird, but as I'm running I'm going to--
Actually, back me up to about there.

02:09:41.599 --> 02:09:42.827
MATT: There?

02:09:42.827 --> 02:09:47.180
TALIESIN: I'm going to try and shoot about right
here, I'm gonna try and unleash the lava to send

02:09:47.180 --> 02:09:53.543
the lava-- to see if I can get it to start flowing
towards. Does that make sense?

02:09:53.543 --> 02:09:58.658
MATT: I will tell you, the pool of lava right
there isn't brimming really close to the surface.

02:09:58.658 --> 02:10:00.123
TALIESIN: Oh, it's just down?

02:10:00.355 --> 02:10:02.780
MATT: It would take a significant impact to carve
anything that would release it.

02:10:02.780 --> 02:10:03.562
TALIESIN: Okay, well--

02:10:03.562 --> 02:10:04.413
MATT: It's self-contained.

02:10:04.413 --> 02:10:06.325
TALIESIN: -- I've come forward enough, I'm gonna
take a shot at one of these guys, then.

02:10:06.325 --> 02:10:08.509
MATT: Okay. This one, or this one?

02:10:08.509 --> 02:10:09.470
TALIESIN: That one.

02:10:09.470 --> 02:10:11.099
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and roll for attack--

02:10:11.099 --> 02:10:13.395
TALIESIN: I'm gonna try something else. I'm gonna
try an ice shot.

02:10:13.395 --> 02:10:19.539
MATT: Ice shot. Okay.

02:10:19.539 --> 02:10:20.914
TALIESIN: 15?

02:10:20.914 --> 02:10:21.830
MATT: 15?

02:10:21.830 --> 02:10:22.790
LIAM: (sneezes dramatically)

02:10:22.790 --> 02:10:23.851
LAURA: Bless you.

02:10:23.851 --> 02:10:25.013
MATT: 15 hits!

02:10:25.013 --> 02:10:27.497
TALIESIN: Oh my god. All right, and that's a--

02:10:27.497 --> 02:10:28.509
TRAVIS: 15 hits.

02:10:28.509 --> 02:10:29.308
LAURA: 15 hits.

02:10:29.308 --> 02:10:31.419
TRAVIS: Let's just take it.

02:10:31.419 --> 02:10:34.592
LAURA: Well, what else are we gonna do with it?

02:10:34.592 --> 02:10:39.621
TALIESIN: -- that's 15 points of damage, plus six
points of ice damage.

02:10:39.621 --> 02:10:45.893
MATT: Okay. The bullet pierces his form. You can
see a part of its gelatinous, physical structure

02:10:45.893 --> 02:10:51.222
quiver. The ice explosion, you see go off, and
just get absorbed into the gelatinous form.

02:10:51.222 --> 02:10:52.144
MARISHA: Fuck.

02:10:52.144 --> 02:10:53.234
TALIESIN: Fuck!

02:10:53.234 --> 02:10:58.006
MATT: Seemingly unaffected by the additional
damage. That's your first shot.

02:10:58.006 --> 02:10:59.044
You get two shots, don't you?

02:10:59.044 --> 02:11:01.621
TALIESIN: That's right. Oh, good god.

02:11:01.621 --> 02:11:04.981
MARISHA: But it didn't split, right?

02:11:04.981 --> 02:11:06.702
MATT and ORION: Nope.

02:11:06.702 --> 02:11:10.122
MARISHA: That's cool. It's a perk.

02:11:10.122 --> 02:11:17.970
TALIESIN: Yeah, no, that's-- Okay. I'm going to
attempt to-- Is there any loose-looking rocks that

02:11:17.970 --> 02:11:21.803
are up above? Or is there anything that looks
like, if I gave it a push,

02:11:21.803 --> 02:11:23.391
would fall down, from up above?

02:11:23.391 --> 02:11:28.147
MATT: This tunnel looks pretty, at this point,
pretty cleanly carved out.

02:11:28.147 --> 02:11:30.777
LAURA: What about the areas I exploded?

02:11:30.777 --> 02:11:33.265
MATT: Over there? I mean, there's parts of the
rock, but the explosion was more damaging to

02:11:33.265 --> 02:11:34.578
things that were fragile--

02:11:34.578 --> 02:11:35.781
LAURA: Okay, okay.

02:11:35.781 --> 02:11:36.989
MATT: -- the stonework is pretty solid.

02:11:36.989 --> 02:11:38.232
TALIESIN: I'm gonna take another shot at the same
one and see what happens.

02:11:38.232 --> 02:11:40.688
MATT: Okay, go for it.

02:11:40.688 --> 02:11:42.136
TALIESIN: 20, that hits.

02:11:42.136 --> 02:11:45.273
MATT: Yep! Damage.

02:11:45.273 --> 02:11:48.572
TALIESIN: Not a lot. That's seven points of
damage.

02:11:48.572 --> 02:11:52.600
MATT: Okay. Gotcha. Both shots into it. You see
its form kind of quiver at the impact, but it's

02:11:52.600 --> 02:11:57.891
still slowly slithering forward. Now comes to
Keyleth!

02:11:57.891 --> 02:12:07.457
MARISHA: Okay. I wanna move, kind of be like,
whoops, sorry, 'scuse me, pardon me, and come like

02:12:07.457 --> 02:12:15.295
heresies. Would you say that I'm 30 feet away from
that guy?

02:12:15.295 --> 02:12:20.204
MATT: Just barely. Like, he's just in the cusp of
30 feet from you.

02:12:20.204 --> 02:12:23.973
MARISHA: Will my Thorn Whip reach him? My
30-foot-range Thorn Whip?

02:12:23.973 --> 02:12:25.771
MATT: You can certainly try!

02:12:25.771 --> 02:12:26.915
MARISHA: I'm gonna try and Thorn Whip him!

02:12:26.915 --> 02:12:27.873
MATT: Okay!

02:12:27.873 --> 02:12:28.970
LIAM: (Cosby voice) You see, the black goo
thing--

02:12:28.970 --> 02:12:30.128
MATT: What's the Thorn Whip do?

02:12:30.128 --> 02:12:31.174
LIAM: -- is not so easy to kill.

02:12:31.174 --> 02:12:32.615
(all laugh)

02:12:32.615 --> 02:12:33.458
MARISHA: Huh?

02:12:33.458 --> 02:12:35.209
MATT: What's the Thorn Whip do? Read the spell for
me.

02:12:35.209 --> 02:12:36.170
ASHLEY: Too soon?

02:12:36.170 --> 02:12:37.251
LAURA: Too soon?

02:12:37.251 --> 02:12:48.194
MARISHA: Well, it does 2d6 damage, it's a 30-foot
range, and it pulls 10 feet. Notes I have on it--

02:12:48.194 --> 02:12:52.892
Okay-- piercing damage-- if they are large or
smaller,

02:12:52.892 --> 02:12:55.342
you pull the creature up to ten feet closer.

02:12:55.342 --> 02:13:00.406
MATT: What type of damage is it?

02:13:00.406 --> 02:13:01.311
MARISHA: Piercing.

02:13:01.311 --> 02:13:04.346
MATT: Okay. Gotcha. All right. So, you hit, go
ahead and roll damage.

02:13:04.346 --> 02:13:08.914
MARISHA: I hit. I don't hit. That's funny. Okay.

02:13:08.914 --> 02:13:10.466
MATT: You rolled a 20, right?

02:13:10.466 --> 02:13:11.383
MARISHA: I didn't roll yet.

02:13:11.383 --> 02:13:12.179
MATT: Oh, you didn't roll yet. Sorry.

02:13:12.179 --> 02:13:12.988
MARISHA: No.

02:13:12.988 --> 02:13:13.912
MATT: Okay, go ahead and roll to hit.

02:13:13.912 --> 02:13:14.679
MARISHA: What do I add, my spell modifier?

02:13:14.679 --> 02:13:15.384
MATT: Yep.

02:13:15.384 --> 02:13:16.031
MARISHA: 18.

02:13:16.031 --> 02:13:16.758
MATT: Yeah, you hit.

02:13:16.758 --> 02:13:17.387
LAURA: Woo!

02:13:17.387 --> 02:13:17.983
ASHLEY: Woo!

02:13:17.983 --> 02:13:18.677
MATT: So, go ahead and roll damage.

02:13:18.677 --> 02:13:19.569
MARISHA: 19, sorry, it's actually 19.

02:13:19.569 --> 02:13:23.053
MATT: That still hits! It doesn't move very fast,
it's a little easy to hit.

02:13:23.053 --> 02:13:25.027
LAURA: Okay, that's good.

02:13:25.027 --> 02:13:25.829
MATT: All right, takes its damage.

02:13:25.829 --> 02:13:31.391
MARISHA: One piercing damage, but I pull him ten
feet closer to me. Does he go into the lava?

02:13:31.391 --> 02:13:36.059
MATT: Gets pushed just ever so slightly into the
hole. As it does, you can see this blackish steam

02:13:36.059 --> 02:13:39.252
and smoke begin to billow up from where it hits,
and it (growls).

02:13:39.252 --> 02:13:40.043
LAURA: Good!

02:13:40.043 --> 02:13:42.043
MATT: -- begins to quiver as you're kind of
yanking it back with the Thorn Whip.

02:13:42.043 --> 02:13:43.062
LIAM: What was that sound it made again?

02:13:43.062 --> 02:13:44.394
MATT: (growls)

02:13:44.394 --> 02:13:45.937
(all laugh)

02:13:45.937 --> 02:13:48.996
MATT: It takes 2d10 points of damage--

02:13:48.996 --> 02:13:49.997
LAURA: Woo!

02:13:49.997 --> 02:13:54.864
MATT: -- from the impact of the lava. That's an
additional 17 points of fire damage to it.

02:13:54.864 --> 02:13:55.686
TALIESIN: That's nice.

02:13:55.686 --> 02:13:56.513
LIAM: Yes!

02:13:56.513 --> 02:13:57.344
LAURA: Fire damage!

02:13:57.344 --> 02:13:58.061
ASHLEY: Nice!

02:13:58.061 --> 02:13:58.897
LIAM: Aw, yes!

02:13:58.897 --> 02:13:59.769
LAURA: Kill it with fire!

02:13:59.769 --> 02:14:00.994
MARISHA: And I've got him on a leash now.

02:14:00.994 --> 02:14:01.781
LIAM: Burn it!

02:14:01.781 --> 02:14:03.133
MATT: You do. Is it considered grappled?

02:14:03.133 --> 02:14:04.393
MARISHA: Nope.

02:14:04.393 --> 02:14:06.304
MATT: Then that would be the end of the attack.
The spell dissipates after that.

02:14:06.304 --> 02:14:07.323
MARISHA: Oh, okay.

02:14:07.323 --> 02:14:08.372
MATT: You've gotta do it again the next turn.

02:14:08.372 --> 02:14:08.974
MARISHA: Okay.

02:14:08.974 --> 02:14:09.586
LIAM: Hey, that was pretty good.

02:14:09.586 --> 02:14:10.322
LAURA: Yep.

02:14:10.322 --> 02:14:11.537
MATT: All right. That ends your turn, Pike, you're
up!

02:14:11.537 --> 02:14:17.885
ASHLEY: Okay. So, question. I want to use
something I think that I can use called-- this may

02:14:17.885 --> 02:14:20.192
be stupid, so I have another option if this is
dumb.

02:14:20.192 --> 02:14:21.035
TRAVIS: That's what it's called?

02:14:21.035 --> 02:14:21.941
LAURA: (laughs)

02:14:21.941 --> 02:14:22.654
ASHLEY: Yes.

02:14:22.654 --> 02:14:23.375
ORION: That's a weird spell!

02:14:23.375 --> 02:14:24.083
LIAM: So long!

02:14:24.083 --> 02:14:25.125
ASHLEY: Something called 'Insect Plague'.

02:14:25.125 --> 02:14:25.762
MATT: Okay.

02:14:25.762 --> 02:14:26.789
MARISHA: Ooh, yeah!

02:14:26.789 --> 02:14:32.619
ASHLEY: Which you can use as a ranged attack in a
20-foot-radius sphere?

02:14:32.619 --> 02:14:35.285
MATT: Yes. So, you do it at range, and it creates
a 20-foot radius that does this.

02:14:35.285 --> 02:14:44.480
ASHLEY: Okay, and then it's a 1d10-- creature
takes 4d10 piercing damage-- oh, on a failed save,

02:14:44.480 --> 02:14:46.331
or half as much damage on a successful one.

02:14:46.331 --> 02:14:47.140
LAURA: Okay.

02:14:47.140 --> 02:14:48.136
MATT: Cool! So there's that, yeah.

02:14:48.136 --> 02:14:49.398
LIAM: Very Old Testament!

02:14:49.398 --> 02:14:50.027
ASHLEY: So, I think--

02:14:50.027 --> 02:14:50.705
MATT: Do you wanna move--

02:14:50.705 --> 02:14:51.497
LAURA: Yeah, do it!

02:14:51.497 --> 02:14:52.466
ASHLEY: Okay, you know, let's give it a try!

02:14:52.466 --> 02:14:53.669
LAURA: And then we can see what it does to
creatures within its zone!

02:14:53.669 --> 02:14:54.614
MATT: Where do you wanna go, girl?

02:14:54.614 --> 02:14:55.587
ASHLEY: Okay, so, where am I? I'm sorry, I can't
see.

02:14:55.587 --> 02:14:57.862
MATT: You're right over here. It's your gold
base.

02:14:57.862 --> 02:14:59.389
ASHLEY: So, where do I need to be to do it-- like
over here?

02:14:59.389 --> 02:15:00.908
LIAM: Get closer.

02:15:00.908 --> 02:15:02.708
LAURA: Maybe up next to the ogre dead.

02:15:02.708 --> 02:15:03.715
LIAM: Gotta run up.

02:15:03.715 --> 02:15:05.743
MATT: Okay. One, two, three, four. That's about as
close as you can get there, yeah.

02:15:05.743 --> 02:15:07.769
ASHLEY: Okay. So can I still get it there?

02:15:07.769 --> 02:15:11.370
MATT: Yeah, you can cast it. Where do you want to
put the radius?

02:15:11.370 --> 02:15:13.124
ASHLEY: Are these all five?

02:15:13.124 --> 02:15:14.136
ORION: Yeah.

02:15:14.136 --> 02:15:15.405
MATT: These are all five-foot squares.

02:15:15.405 --> 02:15:16.206
ASHLEY: Okay, so can I--

02:15:16.206 --> 02:15:18.858
LIAM: I'd just like to point out, this is like the
Avengers trailer, where all the heroes run out and

02:15:18.858 --> 02:15:20.112
jump at the same time.

02:15:20.112 --> 02:15:21.092
(all laugh)

02:15:21.092 --> 02:15:21.858
LAURA: Yeah.

02:15:21.858 --> 02:15:23.139
MATT: Yeah. Yeah, you can get these both from
there.

02:15:23.139 --> 02:15:24.505
ASHLEY: Okay, so I'll try to get them both.

02:15:24.505 --> 02:15:25.536
MATT: Okay, all right, so--

02:15:25.536 --> 02:15:26.514
ASHLEY: So then ten.

02:15:26.514 --> 02:15:27.932
MATT: So you go ahead and roll the damage.

02:15:27.932 --> 02:15:30.326
ASHLEY: Okay, so how-- Wait, how many do I roll,
again? At fifth level?

02:15:30.326 --> 02:15:32.792
MATT: You're casting this as a fifth-level spell?

02:15:32.792 --> 02:15:34.038
ASHLEY: Well, maybe I shouldn't--

02:15:34.038 --> 02:15:34.798
MATT: It's up to you.

02:15:34.798 --> 02:15:35.364
LAURA: Yeah, do it.

02:15:35.364 --> 02:15:36.040
ASHLEY: Okay, I'll do it.

02:15:36.040 --> 02:15:37.023
LIAM: Do it, do it, try it.

02:15:37.023 --> 02:15:38.486
ASHLEY: But do I save a healing?

02:15:38.486 --> 02:15:39.321
LIAM: Do it.

02:15:39.321 --> 02:15:39.935
LAURA: Go for it, Pike.

02:15:39.935 --> 02:15:40.891
LIAM: Come on, you're a warrior.

02:15:40.891 --> 02:15:41.857
MATT: It's up to you, Pike. You do what you gotta
do.

02:15:41.857 --> 02:15:46.768
ASHLEY: Okay, so-- Cool, one.

02:15:46.768 --> 02:15:47.449
LAURA: Ten.

02:15:47.449 --> 02:15:48.262
LIAM: Ten.

02:15:48.262 --> 02:15:48.922
ASHLEY: Ten, 11.

02:15:48.922 --> 02:15:49.851
LAURA: 18.

02:15:49.851 --> 02:15:50.933
ASHLEY: 19.

02:15:50.933 --> 02:15:51.700
MATT: Okay.

02:15:51.700 --> 02:15:52.823
ASHLEY: So how many do I roll? That was three--

02:15:52.823 --> 02:15:54.537
MATT: It gets to make a saving throw to see if it
gets half damage.

02:15:54.537 --> 02:15:55.987
ASHLEY: So I roll another one then--

02:15:55.987 --> 02:15:57.037
LAURA: Yeah, four. She gets four.

02:15:57.037 --> 02:15:57.677
MATT: What's--

02:15:57.677 --> 02:16:00.332
ASHLEY: I roll, I roll four. Hold on. 19.

02:16:00.332 --> 02:16:01.006
LAURA: 25.

02:16:01.006 --> 02:16:01.761
LIAM: 25.

02:16:01.761 --> 02:16:02.483
ASHLEY: 25.

02:16:02.483 --> 02:16:04.484
MATT: Okay, what's the DC? What's your spell DC at
the top of your spell sheet?

02:16:04.484 --> 02:16:06.713
ASHLEY: Eight plus-- Or-- No, sorry, sorry, sorry,
sorry.

02:16:06.713 --> 02:16:07.509
MATT: DC should be--

02:16:07.509 --> 02:16:08.414
ASHLEY: 16.

02:16:08.414 --> 02:16:09.252
LIAM: That's better.

02:16:09.252 --> 02:16:10.368
MATT: 16, okay, one makes its save, the other
doesn't.

02:16:10.368 --> 02:16:11.198
ASHLEY: Okay.

02:16:11.198 --> 02:16:12.439
MATT: So what's the total damage?

02:16:12.439 --> 02:16:13.146
LAURA: 25.

02:16:13.146 --> 02:16:13.875
ASHLEY: 25.

02:16:13.875 --> 02:16:16.418
MATT: Okay, so one takes 25, one takes 13.

02:16:16.418 --> 02:16:17.199
ORION: Cool.

02:16:17.199 --> 02:16:18.121
TALIESIN: Wow.

02:16:18.121 --> 02:16:24.235
MATT: Piercing damage. Got it. And, just, insects
appear in the area, doing that much damage. Does

02:16:24.235 --> 02:16:26.510
that stay? Or does that go away at the end of your
turn?

02:16:26.510 --> 02:16:28.778
ASHLEY: Let's see here.

02:16:28.778 --> 02:16:30.491
MATT: What's the duration?

02:16:30.491 --> 02:16:32.090
ASHLEY: Concentration. Up to ten minutes.

02:16:32.090 --> 02:16:33.142
MATT: So you can keep it there if you want to.

02:16:33.142 --> 02:16:33.717
LAURA: Ooh.

02:16:33.717 --> 02:16:34.555
ASHLEY: I'll just keep it.

02:16:34.555 --> 02:16:36.104
MATT: It just does damage every turn to everything
in that radius.

02:16:36.104 --> 02:16:36.924
ASHLEY: Awesome, let's just keep it.

02:16:36.924 --> 02:16:38.055
MATT: Okay.

02:16:38.055 --> 02:16:39.916
ASHLEY: I'm just really concentrating.

02:16:39.916 --> 02:16:41.997
MATT: That ends your turn. Grog, you're up.

02:16:41.997 --> 02:16:49.485
TRAVIS: Right, I would like to pull the flaming
hammer out of the bag of holding.

02:16:49.485 --> 02:16:50.700
LAURA: Yeah.

02:16:50.700 --> 02:16:55.538
TRAVIS: And I would like to run at the-- this
little-- this guy.

02:16:55.538 --> 02:16:57.474
ORION: No, you'll get in the insect cloud.

02:16:57.474 --> 02:16:58.263
TRAVIS: What?

02:16:58.263 --> 02:16:59.497
ORION: You'll get in the insect cloud.

02:16:59.497 --> 02:17:00.481
MATT: All right. One, two, three, four.

02:17:00.481 --> 02:17:03.068
LAURA: Stay away from the insect cloud.

02:17:03.068 --> 02:17:04.578
TRAVIS: I forgot there was an insect cloud.

02:17:04.578 --> 02:17:07.500
MATT: Five, six, seven, eight. That's as far as
you can get, currently.

02:17:07.500 --> 02:17:08.446
TRAVIS: Oh, because there are bodies in the way?

02:17:08.446 --> 02:17:09.992
MATT: Because of the rough terrain, and you have
to jump over the bodies to get there.

02:17:09.992 --> 02:17:11.117
LAURA: Wait, but my natural ability--

02:17:11.117 --> 02:17:14.750
TRAVIS: Then if that's as far as I can get, I
would like to take the hooded lantern I have out

02:17:14.750 --> 02:17:16.541
of the bag of holding and throw it--

02:17:16.541 --> 02:17:19.930
LAURA: Difficult terrain does not slow my group's
travel when this is my favored terrain.

02:17:19.930 --> 02:17:20.785
MARISHA: Ooh!

02:17:20.785 --> 02:17:24.066
(all cheer)

02:17:24.066 --> 02:17:27.262
TRAVIS: Yes!

02:17:27.262 --> 02:17:29.985
MATT: Nice one. Boom, boom, boom. So you just go
charging up overtop the ogre bodies, leaping,

02:17:29.985 --> 02:17:32.475
coming down with the-- hammer, you said?

02:17:32.475 --> 02:17:33.667
TRAVIS: Yes, with the flaming hammer.

02:17:33.667 --> 02:17:34.722
LIAM: Oh man, you the real MVP.

02:17:34.722 --> 02:17:37.643
TRAVIS: -- activating the flaming properties of
rage, and urine, and death.

02:17:37.735 --> 02:17:38.871
MATT: Okay.

02:17:38.871 --> 02:17:39.944
TALIESIN: Flame on.

02:17:39.944 --> 02:17:41.143
(all laugh)

02:17:41.143 --> 02:17:42.214
ORION: Rage, urine, and death.

02:17:42.214 --> 02:17:42.897
LIAM: Wow.

02:17:42.897 --> 02:17:44.101
LAURA: Don't get touched by it. Don't let it touch
you.

02:17:44.101 --> 02:17:44.834
TRAVIS: We'll see.

02:17:44.834 --> 02:17:45.716
ASHLEY: Don't let it touch you.

02:17:45.716 --> 02:17:46.723
LIAM: Work those rules.

02:17:46.723 --> 02:17:49.587
MATT: Go for it. So go ahead and roll for attack.
You have three attacks with this, at--

02:17:49.587 --> 02:17:50.813
MARISHA: Rage, urine, and death.

02:17:50.813 --> 02:17:51.882
MATT: Are you frenzying or regular rage?

02:17:51.882 --> 02:17:53.383
TRAVIS: Raging, raging, rage. Just regular rage.

02:17:53.383 --> 02:17:54.409
MATT: Okay, so you get two attacks.

02:17:54.409 --> 02:17:55.406
TRAVIS: Yeah. 19.

02:17:55.406 --> 02:17:57.591
MATT: 19 hits.

02:17:57.591 --> 02:17:59.644
TRAVIS: And 12.

02:17:59.644 --> 02:18:01.348
MATT: 12 also hits.

02:18:01.348 --> 02:18:02.348
(all cheer)

02:18:02.348 --> 02:18:04.221
TRAVIS: Awesome. And this is a 1d--

02:18:04.221 --> 02:18:07.839
MATT: And damage, are you using it two-handed?

02:18:07.839 --> 02:18:08.868
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:18:08.868 --> 02:18:10.078
MATT: 1d10 damage.

02:18:10.078 --> 02:18:10.821
TRAVIS: 1d10.

02:18:10.821 --> 02:18:15.619
MATT: Plus whatever the fire damage is on the
weapon.

02:18:15.619 --> 02:18:16.994
TRAVIS: That can't be right.

02:18:16.994 --> 02:18:18.679
MATT: What did you roll?

02:18:18.679 --> 02:18:20.361
MARISHA: What? What the dice rolled?

02:18:20.361 --> 02:18:22.459
TRAVIS: 1d10? Is this the right dice?

02:18:22.686 --> 02:18:23.771
TALIESIN: If you rolled zero, you rolled a ten.

02:18:23.771 --> 02:18:25.326
LAURA: If it's a zero, it's a ten.

02:18:25.326 --> 02:18:26.020
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:18:26.020 --> 02:18:26.837
TRAVIS: It's a 30.

02:18:26.837 --> 02:18:27.622
LAURA: Oh, that's a three. He rolled the--

02:18:27.622 --> 02:18:28.392
MATT: Yeah.

02:18:28.392 --> 02:18:29.600
TRAVIS: I was like, 30!

02:18:29.600 --> 02:18:32.481
MATT: So, three plus your proficiency modifier,
which is four.

02:18:32.481 --> 02:18:34.488
TRAVIS: Yeah. Seven.

02:18:34.488 --> 02:18:38.621
MATT: No, this is for damage, so the damage would
be plus your strength modifier.

02:18:38.621 --> 02:18:40.129
TRAVIS: Oh, four.

02:18:40.129 --> 02:18:42.103
MATT: Yeah, so four still. So seven.

02:18:42.103 --> 02:18:43.582
TRAVIS: And plus seven for rage.

02:18:43.582 --> 02:18:45.704
MATT: Plus two for rage.

02:18:45.704 --> 02:18:46.975
TRAVIS: Plus two for rage.

02:18:46.975 --> 02:18:49.732
MATT: Yeah, so whatever the bonus is to your
greataxe--

02:18:49.732 --> 02:18:50.541
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:18:50.541 --> 02:18:51.544
MATT: What's that?

02:18:51.544 --> 02:18:54.933
TRAVIS: Oh, it's-- to the greataxe is seven when
I'm raging.

02:18:54.933 --> 02:18:57.023
MATT: So then ten points of damage, then roll the
fire damage as well.

02:18:57.023 --> 02:18:58.164
TRAVIS: Okay.

02:18:58.164 --> 02:19:00.107
LIAM: How is he keeping all of this in his mind?
It's like a computer in his brain.

02:19:00.107 --> 02:19:01.738
LAURA: I know.

02:19:01.738 --> 02:19:02.833
TRAVIS: Is that a 1d10 also? 1d10?

02:19:02.899 --> 02:19:05.303
MATT: It should say on the actual magical item.

02:19:05.303 --> 02:19:07.314
TRAVIS: Yep, yep. 1d6.

02:19:07.384 --> 02:19:08.792
MATT: So 1d6 additional fire damage.

02:19:08.869 --> 02:19:11.052
TRAVIS: Five.

02:19:11.260 --> 02:19:14.093
MATT: All right, so 15 points of damage total from
the first strike. Go ahead and roll damage from

02:19:14.093 --> 02:19:15.302
the second one.

02:19:15.302 --> 02:19:19.072
TRAVIS: Oh, Jesus. Seven.

02:19:19.072 --> 02:19:21.156
MATT: So 14, plus an additional 1d6.

02:19:21.156 --> 02:19:23.665
LIAM: Grog, math hard.

02:19:23.665 --> 02:19:26.008
TRAVIS: Three.

02:19:26.008 --> 02:19:31.303
MATT: All right, cool. All right, so as you come
running over, leaping in the air, over the ogre

02:19:31.509 --> 02:19:36.460
bodies, you then slam the hammer once in the side,
the fire catching on the metal, on the black iron

02:19:36.460 --> 02:19:38.617
as it streaks through the air, lighting up the
cavern around you.

02:19:38.617 --> 02:19:39.574
LAURA: Yeah!

02:19:39.574 --> 02:19:41.797
MATT: You guys see this, like, red arc, as Grog
comes slamming down into the ooze.

02:19:41.797 --> 02:19:43.136
ORION: Fire hammer!

02:19:43.136 --> 02:19:47.507
MATT: First one, it hits, boom, smacks, the flames
ignite, and the impact, you see it kind of freaks

02:19:47.507 --> 02:19:53.073
out and quivers backwards, screeching sound. As it
does, there's a splash of the black ichor that

02:19:53.073 --> 02:19:54.018
hits your shoulders--

02:19:54.018 --> 02:19:55.276
LAURA: (gasps) No!

02:19:55.276 --> 02:19:57.991
MATT: -- and you feel it burn and bite into your
torso. You take ten points of acid damage.

02:19:57.991 --> 02:19:58.911
TRAVIS: Oh, shit.

02:19:58.911 --> 02:19:59.585
LAURA: Acid.

02:19:59.585 --> 02:20:00.529
ASHLEY: Acid.

02:20:00.529 --> 02:20:03.364
MATT: You reach back, not even thinking in the
frenzy in your brain, you feel like, just seeing

02:20:03.364 --> 02:20:05.830
blood and red in your eyes, as you slam down your
second strike.

02:20:05.917 --> 02:20:07.238
ASHLEY: Grog is gonna start tripping.

02:20:07.238 --> 02:20:10.764
MATT: You feel the second impact. Once again, you
feel the spray of black across your body. You take

02:20:10.764 --> 02:20:13.204
an additional ten points of acid damage.

02:20:13.330 --> 02:20:14.339
TRAVIS: Up close sucks.

02:20:14.339 --> 02:20:15.253
LIAM: That's nothing for Grog, that's nothing.

02:20:15.253 --> 02:20:16.118
ASHLEY: Nothing, nothing.

02:20:16.118 --> 02:20:17.280
MARISHA: Nothing, he likes it, feels good.

02:20:17.280 --> 02:20:18.473
TRAVIS: I'm pretty low.

02:20:18.473 --> 02:20:19.475
MATT: That ends Grog's turn.

02:20:19.475 --> 02:20:21.309
LAURA: You're low? On health? Have you not healed
at all?

02:20:21.309 --> 02:20:22.598
LIAM: No, we stayed up and kept watch.

02:20:22.598 --> 02:20:23.735
MARISHA: Just helped with that itch you couldn't
scratch.

02:20:23.735 --> 02:20:24.783
LAURA: Jeez Louise.

02:20:24.783 --> 02:20:26.244
TRAVIS: No, I'm fine.

02:20:26.328 --> 02:20:27.855
MATT: On this turn, this one pulls out of the
lava--

02:20:27.855 --> 02:20:28.626
LAURA: No.

02:20:28.626 --> 02:20:32.344
MATT: Takes an additional 2d10 from being in at
the start of its turn. An additional eight damage,

02:20:32.344 --> 02:20:37.771
and moves up, both of them flank over to Grog.

02:20:37.771 --> 02:20:42.167
TRAVIS: Come to me, woodland creatures.

02:20:42.167 --> 02:20:45.897
MATT: Both of them attempting to strike you from
each side. As you're flanked,

02:20:45.897 --> 02:20:50.465
that is a 20 versus armor class.

02:20:50.465 --> 02:20:51.814
TRAVIS: That will hit.

02:20:51.814 --> 02:20:53.289
MATT: And a 21 versus armor class.

02:20:53.289 --> 02:20:55.160
TRAVIS: That'll hit, too.

02:20:55.160 --> 02:20:57.046
MARISHA: You're being attacked by jello.

02:20:57.046 --> 02:21:00.228
MATT: All right, both of the creatures, they
(oozing sound) up next to you. These pseudopods

02:21:00.228 --> 02:21:07.320
kind of come billowing out, slamming into you with
the force of an extremely thick, heavy battering

02:21:07.386 --> 02:21:10.850
ram. Both hit you for-- let's see, here--

02:21:10.850 --> 02:21:12.550
TRAVIS: You broke in their glass casket.

02:21:12.550 --> 02:21:13.949
MATT: One hits you for 12 points of damage--

02:21:13.949 --> 02:21:14.638
LAURA: Oh.

02:21:14.638 --> 02:21:15.367
TRAVIS: Okay.

02:21:15.367 --> 02:21:16.904
MATT: The other hits you for 14 points of damage.

02:21:16.904 --> 02:21:17.912
TRAVIS: Okay.

02:21:17.912 --> 02:21:20.052
MATT: Remember, you're raging, so that's halved.

02:21:20.052 --> 02:21:21.168
TRAVIS: Oh, halved. Both of those?

02:21:21.168 --> 02:21:21.800
MATT: Yeah.

02:21:21.800 --> 02:21:22.646
TRAVIS: Awesome.

02:21:22.646 --> 02:21:24.925
LIAM: Tank.

02:21:24.925 --> 02:21:25.966
ASHLEY: He still has more than me.

02:21:25.966 --> 02:21:31.598
MATT: However, both impacts slamming into your
body, the leftover sludge begins to eat away and

02:21:31.598 --> 02:21:37.182
corrode the flesh upon impact. You take from both
sides-- non-halved, because it is not slashing,

02:21:37.182 --> 02:21:44.330
bludgeoning, or piercing damage-- you take a total
of 56 points of acid damage.

02:21:44.330 --> 02:21:45.151
TALIESIN: What?

02:21:45.151 --> 02:21:46.088
ASHLEY: What?

02:21:46.088 --> 02:21:46.920
LAURA: What?

02:21:46.920 --> 02:21:47.946
MATT: From both slams.

02:21:47.946 --> 02:21:48.762
TRAVIS: That's gross.

02:21:48.762 --> 02:21:49.585
LAURA: (gasps) Grog's unconscious.

02:21:49.585 --> 02:21:50.546
TRAVIS: No, I'm not.

02:21:50.546 --> 02:21:51.365
LAURA: You're not?

02:21:51.365 --> 02:21:52.929
LIAM: Double that? Double that, or that?

02:21:52.929 --> 02:21:56.642
MATT: No, from both sides. 28 from each.

02:21:56.642 --> 02:22:00.833
ASHLEY: How many have you got?

02:22:00.833 --> 02:22:02.855
TRAVIS: 14.

02:22:02.855 --> 02:22:03.458
LAURA: Oh my god.

02:22:03.458 --> 02:22:05.591
TRAVIS: Okay, so little piles of shit have got
huevos.

02:22:05.591 --> 02:22:06.428
ASHLEY: Wait, and I can't--

02:22:06.428 --> 02:22:07.509
MATT: Clarota moves from here, up to here.

02:22:07.509 --> 02:22:08.815
LAURA: Clarota, save us!

02:22:08.815 --> 02:22:11.196
MARISHA: Really bad jello. It's, like, fridge
experiment jello.

02:22:11.196 --> 02:22:12.374
TALIESIN: Coffee jello.

02:22:12.374 --> 02:22:13.361
MARISHA: Coffee jello?

02:22:13.361 --> 02:22:14.773
ASHLEY: Grog!

02:22:14.773 --> 02:22:17.768
TRAVIS: That's me, all smart with the fire
hammer.

02:22:17.768 --> 02:22:19.228
MATT: Hey, it did damage, didn't it?

02:22:19.228 --> 02:22:20.673
TRAVIS: It certainly did something.

02:22:20.673 --> 02:22:22.429
MATT: It certainly did something

02:22:22.429 --> 02:22:30.176
Clarota is going to move forward and is
going to attempt a-- It's kind of close-- He is

02:22:30.264 --> 02:22:33.212
going to attempt a Lightning Bolt against this guy
here.

02:22:33.212 --> 02:22:34.619
MARISHA: No.

02:22:34.619 --> 02:22:38.697
LAURA: Don't do a Lightning Bolt! What? Why would
Clarota use a Lightning Bolt when he saw that the

02:22:38.697 --> 02:22:40.543
lightning did not work for me?

02:22:40.543 --> 02:22:42.831
MATT: Clarota did not see.

02:22:42.831 --> 02:22:43.707
LAURA: Ugh.

02:22:43.707 --> 02:22:45.207
MARISHA: Clarota didn't see? Where was Clarota?

02:22:45.207 --> 02:22:46.362
MATT: Way back here.

02:22:46.362 --> 02:22:47.545
LIAM: He has to look. He was hanging back.

02:22:47.545 --> 02:22:48.790
LAURA: Clarota is trying to screw with us.

02:22:48.790 --> 02:22:50.216
MARISHA: Why was he trailing? What the fuck?

02:22:50.216 --> 02:22:51.127
LIAM: Nah, he was hanging back.

02:22:51.127 --> 02:22:52.040
MARISHA: He's a slacker.

02:22:52.040 --> 02:22:52.916
LIAM: He's weak.

02:22:52.916 --> 02:22:53.796
MARISHA: He's a fucking slacker.

02:22:53.796 --> 02:22:54.710
ORION: That's right, he's weak.

02:22:54.710 --> 02:22:56.598
LIAM: He's got this, but he doesn't have this.
He's weak, he's hanging back.

02:22:56.598 --> 02:22:57.503
MARISHA: All right.

02:22:57.503 --> 02:22:58.818
LIAM: What is the deal with the mind flayer?

02:22:58.818 --> 02:23:00.802
MATT: I would recommend not arguing with the DM.

02:23:00.802 --> 02:23:01.458
ORION: Right.

02:23:01.458 --> 02:23:02.140
TRAVIS: Yeah, right.

02:23:02.140 --> 02:23:04.349
MARISHA: I'm not arguing with the DM, I'm calling
Clarota a slacker.

02:23:04.349 --> 02:23:08.621
MATT: Clarota, as it released the bolt of energy,
it streaks past, through the air. It arcs into the

02:23:08.621 --> 02:23:16.316
side of the entity, which then absorbs it.
Clarota's eyes go wide for a second.

02:23:16.316 --> 02:23:19.373
Nervous, it looks at its hands, and puts
them back underneath its robe. As it does--

02:23:19.373 --> 02:23:20.491
LAURA: Fudge!

02:23:20.491 --> 02:23:25.001
MARISHA: Damn it, Clarota.

02:23:25.001 --> 02:23:28.831
MATT: The entity divides once again.

02:23:28.831 --> 02:23:31.574
LAURA: God! Darn it.

02:23:31.574 --> 02:23:32.499
MATT: Into two more--

02:23:32.499 --> 02:23:33.443
LAURA: What is that?

02:23:33.443 --> 02:23:34.345
TRAVIS: Oh, shit.

02:23:34.345 --> 02:23:35.193
LAURA: What is happening?

02:23:35.193 --> 02:23:35.876
TRAVIS: Balls.

02:23:35.876 --> 02:23:36.785
TALIESIN: Oh, god.

02:23:36.785 --> 02:23:41.264
MATT: That ends its turn. At this point in time,
now the loud ruckus

02:23:41.264 --> 02:23:44.300
has been glaring through this tunnel--

02:23:44.300 --> 02:23:45.386
LIAM: Shit.

02:23:45.386 --> 02:23:47.269
MATT: You hear (clicking sound).

02:23:47.269 --> 02:23:48.217
LIAM: Shit.

02:23:48.217 --> 02:23:49.670
TRAVIS: Ah, not an umber hulk.

02:23:49.670 --> 02:23:51.102
LAURA: Is it another one of those--

02:23:51.102 --> 02:23:53.874
MATT: A pair of clacking sounds. And you, as soon
as you look up at the ceiling and you see two

02:23:53.874 --> 02:24:02.004
large creatures clinging to the ceiling, scurrying
across with these strange hooked hands, before

02:24:02.070 --> 02:24:05.065
both immediately leap down from the ceiling.

02:24:05.133 --> 02:24:06.242
TRAVIS: We're in big trouble.

02:24:06.242 --> 02:24:07.240
TALIESIN: Jesus Christ.

02:24:07.240 --> 02:24:07.931
LIAM: Oh, man.

02:24:07.931 --> 02:24:08.992
LAURA: Are you freaking kidding me?

02:24:08.992 --> 02:24:10.460
MARISHA: What are those? What is that?

02:24:10.460 --> 02:24:12.178
LAURA: He's trying to kill us.

02:24:12.178 --> 02:24:12.836
ORION: Oh.

02:24:12.836 --> 02:24:13.805
LAURA: What is this?

02:24:13.805 --> 02:24:18.142
MATT: These two large, armored, beak-faced
subterranean creatures with shells on their backs

02:24:18.142 --> 02:24:20.658
and giant hooked arms leap down from the ceiling.

02:24:20.658 --> 02:24:24.425
LAURA: We're gonna die.

02:24:24.425 --> 02:24:32.638
MATT: One is going to attempt to strike with both
of its hook attacks at Pike.

02:24:32.638 --> 02:24:34.027
LAURA: Pike isn't here!

02:24:34.027 --> 02:24:35.657
MATT: This is one is moving over Tiberius.

02:24:35.657 --> 02:24:38.387
LIAM: Oh, Tiberius, our soft, vulnerable spot.

02:24:38.387 --> 02:24:39.959
ORION: What are you talking about?

02:24:39.959 --> 02:24:42.688
MATT: So, against Pike, that is 21.

02:24:42.688 --> 02:24:43.736
LAURA: Hits.

02:24:43.736 --> 02:24:44.320
TRAVIS: Hits.

02:24:44.320 --> 02:24:45.448
MATT: And 13.

02:24:45.448 --> 02:24:46.206
TRAVIS: Misses.

02:24:46.206 --> 02:24:47.102
LAURA: Misses.

02:24:47.102 --> 02:24:48.827
MATT: All right, you take 11 points of piercing
damage.

02:24:48.827 --> 02:24:50.663
LAURA: Okay.

02:24:50.663 --> 02:24:55.232
MATT: Wherever she is. And the other one misses,
clanging against the armor. The hook scrapes

02:24:55.232 --> 02:25:01.209
across metal, leaving this extremely loud sound.
The other one goes twice against Tiberius.

02:25:01.209 --> 02:25:02.876
That is a 16.

02:25:02.876 --> 02:25:04.565
ORION: A 17.

02:25:04.565 --> 02:25:15.949
MATT: And a nine. Both miss. Barely getting out of
the way. This giant, large, armored creature.

02:25:16.014 --> 02:25:17.749
ASHLEY: Falling from the ceiling.

02:25:17.749 --> 02:25:20.303
MATT: Right there, take a look-- All right, that
ends that, so top of the round.

02:25:20.303 --> 02:25:22.188
Tiberius, you're up.

02:25:22.188 --> 02:25:25.617
ORION: Oh, I look at him with a funky grin.

02:25:25.617 --> 02:25:26.367
MATT: All right.

02:25:26.367 --> 02:25:34.903
ORION: It's a funky one. How much does he weigh?
800 pounds?

02:25:34.903 --> 02:25:41.538
MATT: Pretty heavy. Say probably close to 500-600
pounds.

02:25:41.538 --> 02:25:46.235
ORION: Ah, beautiful. I cast Telekinesis and I
hurl him over my head and chuck him at the other

02:25:46.235 --> 02:25:55.321
one. I want to get him away from Pike. I don't
think I can throw him that far. How far away is he

02:25:55.321 --> 02:25:56.658
from the lava, actually?

02:25:56.658 --> 02:25:58.586
MATT: It's about right there. It's about 35 feet.

02:25:58.586 --> 02:26:00.089
ASHLEY: I'm okay. I have a lot of armor.

02:26:00.089 --> 02:26:01.224
LAURA: She's good.

02:26:01.224 --> 02:26:03.579
ORION: Then I'll try that instead. I'll try to
slam dunk.

02:26:03.579 --> 02:26:10.322
MATT: He makes a saving throw. That fails
entirely. So the creature in front of you lifts up

02:26:10.322 --> 02:26:14.746
in the air, and starts flailing about with its
hooks, trying to find some purchase in the

02:26:14.746 --> 02:26:20.163
ceiling. You toss it over, and it lands squarely
into the pool of lava in the center of the tunnel.

02:26:20.163 --> 02:26:26.504
You hear screeching in pain as it begins trying to
find his way out. Okay.

02:26:26.504 --> 02:26:27.823
LIAM: Yes! Yes!

02:26:27.823 --> 02:26:32.086
MARISHA: I like lava pools. I like lava pools.

02:26:32.086 --> 02:26:40.957
MATT: As it's fully submerged, all right, that is
45 points of fire damage on it immediately as it's

02:26:41.031 --> 02:26:42.958
slowly sinking into the pool of lava.

02:26:42.958 --> 02:26:45.649
TRAVIS: He starts sinking into the pool of lava?

02:26:45.649 --> 02:26:46.718
ASHLEY: Whoa.

02:26:46.718 --> 02:26:49.200
MATT: Tiberius just Telekinesis-ed him up in the
air, and threw it into the lava pool.

02:26:49.200 --> 02:26:50.041
TRAVIS: Yes.

02:26:50.041 --> 02:26:51.034
LAURA: Good job.

02:26:51.034 --> 02:26:55.193
ORION: I use two sorcerer points, and with the
other one I do Glacial Blast at the other guy.

02:26:55.193 --> 02:26:59.867
MATT: The other one there? Okay. Go ahead and
roll-- Add your--

02:26:59.867 --> 02:27:04.733
LAURA: Damn, Tiberius is getting really freaking
cool. Badass.

02:27:04.733 --> 02:27:08.500
ORION: Spell attack, right?

02:27:08.500 --> 02:27:09.517
MATT: Yeah.

02:27:09.517 --> 02:27:13.839
ORION: 13 plus two. 15.

02:27:13.913 --> 02:27:21.986
MATT: 15? Right now, because of the level of
darkness in the room, and because of its distance

02:27:21.986 --> 02:27:27.833
from you-- You just managed to fire, just out of
the range of the creature. It hits the wall behind

02:27:27.833 --> 02:27:31.035
him, leaving the slick of ice across the stone
wall behind it,

02:27:31.035 --> 02:27:33.407
but unfortunately not the actual creature.

02:27:33.407 --> 02:27:42.475
ORION: Okay. Okay. Oh! Right behind it? Do I see
myself missing too? Fine. As I'm missing I'll form

02:27:42.475 --> 02:27:48.985
it into a spike at the end where the walls hit.

02:27:48.985 --> 02:27:49.864
MATT: Okay!

02:27:49.864 --> 02:27:51.046
TRAVIS: Yeah!

02:27:51.046 --> 02:27:56.671
MATT: There is now an ice spike jutting out of the
wall right there. All right, that ends your turn,

02:27:56.671 --> 02:27:58.366
unless you want to move. Still got your move
action.

02:27:58.366 --> 02:27:59.223
LAURA: Ooh. Nice!

02:27:59.223 --> 02:28:02.224
ORION: I'm going to-- where's the-- that way.

02:28:02.224 --> 02:28:03.240
MATT: This way.

02:28:03.240 --> 02:28:05.390
ORION: Out the hell-- with the stuff-- yes.

02:28:05.390 --> 02:28:09.779
MATT: Now it would be the ogres, but they're all
dead.

02:28:09.779 --> 02:28:11.247
(all cheer)

02:28:11.247 --> 02:28:12.455
MATT: Scanlan's up.

02:28:12.455 --> 02:28:15.187
TRAVIS: Yeah, come on, Scanlan!

02:28:15.187 --> 02:28:19.810
MATT: Sees Pike in great danger. Sings a quick
little ditty to go ahead and give an inspiration

02:28:19.810 --> 02:28:23.762
dice to Pike. So you get a d8.

02:28:23.762 --> 02:28:24.836
ASHLEY: Okay.

02:28:24.836 --> 02:28:30.416
MATT: To help you with any sort of attack rolls,
any saving throws, ability checks.

02:28:30.416 --> 02:28:37.340
ASHLEY: How about for healing? Does it help with
healing? Can I add it to anything?

02:28:37.340 --> 02:28:39.259
MATT: Just attack rolls, saving throws, and
checks.

02:28:39.259 --> 02:28:40.259
ASHLEY: Okay.

02:28:40.259 --> 02:28:47.873
MATT: Scanlan is going to attempt to dominate the
monster using his Dominate Creature spell. Saving

02:28:47.873 --> 02:29:00.335
throw. It does not make it. The creature that was
harrowing Pike suddenly drops its claws for a

02:29:00.335 --> 02:29:08.235
second, turns away from you, and starts looking
back towards the oozes and Grog.

02:29:08.235 --> 02:29:11.680
That brings us to Vex. You're up.

02:29:11.680 --> 02:29:18.727
LAURA: Okay. Do I have line-of-sight on the other
ooze that's attacking Grog? The big one?

02:29:18.727 --> 02:29:25.593
MATT: The big one over here? You do. It's dark,
and you have no light source currently, so you can

02:29:25.593 --> 02:29:28.262
try a shot, but it's going to be at disadvantage.

02:29:28.262 --> 02:29:30.269
LAURA: Okay, then I guess I should just--

02:29:30.269 --> 02:29:33.555
LIAM: Half-elves see in dim light up to 60 feet.
Does that pool of lava give anything?

02:29:33.555 --> 02:29:36.370
MATT: It gives a very dull glow to the room. It's
enough where you can see there is something there.

02:29:36.370 --> 02:29:38.825
You can even take a shot as opposed to not having
any chance.

02:29:38.825 --> 02:29:42.017
LAURA: What about the little ooze? One of the
little oozes?

02:29:42.017 --> 02:29:44.915
MATT: Same possibility because you're currently
blocked by this creature

02:29:45.002 --> 02:29:46.918
that's currently sinking into the lava.

02:29:46.918 --> 02:29:53.036
LAURA: I guess I should attack the one that's in
the lava.

02:29:53.036 --> 02:29:54.876
MATT: Okay.

02:29:54.876 --> 02:30:07.929
LAURA: Okay. Well. Oh! Can I-- Is he within ten or
five feet of the other, the little ooze?

02:30:07.929 --> 02:30:10.894
MATT: No, he's ten feet from it.

02:30:10.894 --> 02:30:15.036
LAURA: Okay, then I'll just attack him with my--
I'll just attack him.

02:30:15.245 --> 02:30:15.991
MATT: Okay.

02:30:15.991 --> 02:30:17.665
LAURA: This is lame, that's a lame--

02:30:17.665 --> 02:30:18.955
TRAVIS: Do it!

02:30:18.955 --> 02:30:20.077
MATT: So you have two attacks.

02:30:20.077 --> 02:30:21.119
LIAM: Oh.

02:30:21.119 --> 02:30:23.851
LAURA: Oh right, two attacks. 13?

02:30:23.851 --> 02:30:28.598
MATT: 13 misses, unfortunately.

02:30:28.598 --> 02:30:31.286
LAURA: Pathetic. 20-something.

02:30:31.286 --> 02:30:35.019
MATT: That hits. So the first one, you fire
towards it, except the arrow just (whoosh) into

02:30:35.019 --> 02:30:36.539
the lava and (puff).

02:30:36.539 --> 02:30:37.551
LAURA: All right, cool.

02:30:37.551 --> 02:30:38.898
MATT: With a slight puff of smoke.

02:30:38.898 --> 02:30:40.896
LAURA: Can I have used my flaming bowstring on the
second one?

02:30:40.896 --> 02:30:41.778
MATT: On the second one? If you'd like to.

02:30:41.778 --> 02:30:47.927
LAURA: Sweet. Oh! And I Hunter's Marked him,
because I can do that.

02:30:47.927 --> 02:30:50.156
MATT: All right, so you moved the Hunter's Mark
over, he is now your quarry.

02:30:50.156 --> 02:30:51.005
LAURA: 13.

02:30:51.005 --> 02:30:52.880
MATT: Go ahead and roll the additional fire damage
and your quarry damage.

02:30:52.880 --> 02:31:03.886
LAURA: 13. 19 and 22 damage.

02:31:03.886 --> 02:31:10.342
MATT: 22 damage, all righty. The one arrow
disappears. The second one, as you release it from

02:31:10.342 --> 02:31:14.228
the bowstring, you feel the slight tingle of the
arcane energy released into the arrow. The arrow

02:31:14.228 --> 02:31:17.737
bursts into flame as it releases from your bow,
streaking and piercing the front of its hide as

02:31:17.737 --> 02:31:19.455
it's trying to claw its way out.

02:31:19.455 --> 02:31:20.221
ORION: Nice!

02:31:20.221 --> 02:31:22.432
MATT: Both of its claws are at the edges of the
lava, and it's pulling itself, screeching, its

02:31:22.432 --> 02:31:26.562
mouth and eyes wild with the severe pain it's
feeling as it's slowly melting him from the

02:31:26.562 --> 02:31:31.996
bottom. The arrow (impact sound) into its shoulder
and burst into flame. It's now freaking out. It

02:31:31.996 --> 02:31:34.392
looks like it's having a really, really rough time
making its way out.

02:31:34.392 --> 02:31:35.251
LAURA: Okay.

02:31:35.251 --> 02:31:39.145
MATT: Do you want to move, or you going to stay
where you are?

02:31:39.145 --> 02:31:45.442
LAURA: I'm gonna back up and get against the wall.
Oh wait, that's me!

02:31:45.442 --> 02:31:46.348
MATT: That's you there.

02:31:46.348 --> 02:31:48.488
LAURA: Oh, I was thinking I was Keyleth, I'm gonna
come up next to Keyleth.

02:31:48.488 --> 02:31:49.493
MATT: All right, so right there?

02:31:49.493 --> 02:31:50.534
LAURA: No, against the wall.

02:31:50.534 --> 02:31:51.391
MATT: All right, there?

02:31:51.391 --> 02:31:52.072
LAURA: Yeah.

02:31:52.072 --> 02:31:54.403
MATT: All right. That ends your turn. Vax, you're
up.

02:31:54.403 --> 02:32:01.457
LIAM: Okay, I'm gonna run over the dude in the
lava, I'm gonna jump on him, probably make an

02:32:01.457 --> 02:32:06.139
acrobatics check and land right around here,
between the two little slimes.

02:32:06.139 --> 02:32:07.000
MATT: Acrobatics check.

02:32:07.000 --> 02:32:07.810
LIAM: Yeah.

02:32:07.810 --> 02:32:08.877
LAURA: Don't let the slimes hit you.

02:32:08.877 --> 02:32:10.530
MARISHA: Vault the lava.

02:32:10.530 --> 02:32:12.341
LIAM: It's acrobatics. 22.

02:32:12.341 --> 02:32:15.521
MARISHA: Vault that lava.

02:32:15.521 --> 02:32:18.674
MATT: You jump, impact, and barely land next to
them.

02:32:18.674 --> 02:32:19.705
LAURA: Oh my gosh.

02:32:19.705 --> 02:32:21.888
LIAM: Now, because they are, because Grog is--

02:32:21.888 --> 02:32:23.894
MATT: It does get one swipe of attack of
opportunity on you as you pass by.

02:32:23.894 --> 02:32:26.345
LIAM: Fine.

02:32:26.345 --> 02:32:27.630
MATT: That is going to be a 20.

02:32:27.630 --> 02:32:29.937
LIAM: Okay. It's fine.

02:32:29.937 --> 02:32:31.560
MATT: So, as you leap off of it, its hook swipes
up towards you.

02:32:31.560 --> 02:32:39.547
You go ahead and take 14 points of 
piercing damage.

02:32:39.547 --> 02:32:40.567
LAURA: That's a big hit!

02:32:40.567 --> 02:32:42.366
LIAM: Yeah.

02:32:42.437 --> 02:32:43.645
MATT: All right.

02:32:43.645 --> 02:32:48.957
LIAM: Okay. Okay and since I land, since Grog is
right up against those two--

02:32:48.957 --> 02:32:49.889
MATT: I will eat this later.

02:32:49.889 --> 02:32:55.873
LIAM: I can Sneak Attack one or both of them, so
I'm gonna hit the one closest to the party first.

02:32:55.873 --> 02:32:56.752
MATT: Okay.

02:32:56.752 --> 02:32:57.964
LIAM: This is Sneak Attack.

02:32:57.964 --> 02:32:58.727
MATT: All righty.

02:32:58.727 --> 02:33:00.772
LIAM: This is, this is-- It's an 18.

02:33:00.772 --> 02:33:04.376
MATT: All right, that hits.

02:33:04.376 --> 02:33:11.323
LIAM: Three plus seven is-- this is my flametongue
dagger, so that's-- Oh, hold on, no, I don't know

02:33:11.323 --> 02:33:22.430
what it is yet. Where's my pencil? I'm sending my
dice everywhere. Nine plus six, ten, 15, 18, 40.

02:33:22.430 --> 02:33:27.484
58 on one slime.

02:33:27.484 --> 02:33:29.361
MATT: What is the piercing damage from the
dagger?

02:33:29.361 --> 02:33:30.856
LIAM: The piercing damage?

02:33:30.856 --> 02:33:31.868
MATT: Daggers are piercing, so yeah.

02:33:31.868 --> 02:33:35.516
LIAM: So I don't know. What is that? Is that
what's besides the Sneak Attack damage?

02:33:35.516 --> 02:33:39.101
MATT: Thank you kindly. Mysterious appearance of
paper towels.

02:33:39.171 --> 02:33:46.071
LIAM: That's 18. If it's doubled for the Sneak
Attack? I don't know. It's nine, without a Sneak

02:33:46.156 --> 02:33:47.898
Attack. 18 if it's Sneak Attack.

02:33:47.898 --> 02:33:49.593
MATT: Right. Well, it's a Sneak Attack, because it
is flanking.

02:33:49.593 --> 02:33:50.854
LIAM: So 18 for Sneak Attack.

02:33:50.854 --> 02:33:53.860
MATT: Okay, got you. Cool.

02:33:53.860 --> 02:33:55.473
LIAM: That's first dagger.

02:33:55.473 --> 02:33:56.946
MATT: All right, so second dagger. Go ahead and--

02:33:56.946 --> 02:34:05.331
LIAM: Second dagger attacks the other one. I just
turn around and sink down into the other one for

02:34:05.331 --> 02:34:09.198
16 with the keen, yeah, 16 with the keen dagger.

02:34:09.198 --> 02:34:10.427
MATT: That hits, go ahead and roll damage.

02:34:10.427 --> 02:34:13.495
LIAM: Okay, and this is probably not Sneak Attack
at this point, or is it? I don't know.

02:34:13.495 --> 02:34:14.604
MATT: No, you'll do only one Sneak Attack per
round.

02:34:14.604 --> 02:34:15.532
LIAM: Okay, eight.

02:34:15.532 --> 02:34:20.049
MATT: Eight, gotcha. So as you rush, you leap off,
take the scratch in the air from the hook horror

02:34:20.049 --> 02:34:24.935
creature. You land on the ground, slash one with
your dagger, slash the other. Both slashes are

02:34:24.935 --> 02:34:31.088
almost simultaneous. As you hit, you feel your
blades gain purchase in both creatures, and you

02:34:31.297 --> 02:34:34.500
look down at your arms as the horrible burning
sensation filters onto your hands as the

02:34:34.500 --> 02:34:40.758
splash-back. You take a total of 20 points of acid
damage from the melee attacks

02:34:40.758 --> 02:34:41.787
you took against the creatures.

02:34:41.787 --> 02:34:42.969
LIAM: 20, you said?

02:34:42.969 --> 02:34:43.659
MATT: 20 total, yes.

02:34:43.659 --> 02:34:44.658
LAURA: (whispers) Oh my god.

02:34:44.658 --> 02:34:46.086
LIAM: Okay. All right.

02:34:46.086 --> 02:34:47.603
MATT: All right. That brings us to Percy.

02:34:47.603 --> 02:34:49.016
ASHLEY: You're at 24? Fuck.

02:34:49.016 --> 02:34:50.420
LIAM: It's all right.

02:34:50.420 --> 02:34:51.431
TALIESIN: Where's the laser?

02:34:51.431 --> 02:34:53.006
MARISHA: So they're all still alive, all the oozes
are still alive.

02:34:53.006 --> 02:34:54.195
TALIESIN: Laser.

02:34:54.195 --> 02:34:56.414
MARISHA: It was around here somewhere. You had it
last.

02:34:56.414 --> 02:34:58.554
TRAVIS: What are you looking for?

02:34:58.554 --> 02:34:59.725
LAURA: What? What's happening?

02:34:59.725 --> 02:35:00.932
TALIESIN: Oh, never mind.

02:35:00.932 --> 02:35:02.222
MARISHA: Did I have it? Oh, wait, wait, wait,
wait.

02:35:02.222 --> 02:35:03.151
TALIESIN: Yeah you had it, aha!

02:35:03.151 --> 02:35:04.268
MATT: Percy, what you got?

02:35:04.268 --> 02:35:08.812
TALIESIN: I wanna move just slightly to my right.
Just over there

02:35:08.812 --> 02:35:11.003
so I can get a clear shot at the oozes.

02:35:11.003 --> 02:35:13.061
MATT: Okay, so right there?

02:35:13.061 --> 02:35:14.892
TALIESIN: Yeah, about right there, so I'm not
going to hit anybody.

02:35:14.892 --> 02:35:15.700
MATT: Okay.

02:35:15.700 --> 02:35:19.173
TALIESIN: I'm gonna take two shots at the little
oozes. At the--

02:35:19.173 --> 02:35:20.342
MATT: This one here?

02:35:20.342 --> 02:35:21.438
TALIESIN: Yeah, that right little ooze.

02:35:21.438 --> 02:35:22.475
MATT: Okay.

02:35:22.475 --> 02:35:23.826
MARISHA: Little ooze.

02:35:23.826 --> 02:35:38.949
TALIESIN: First shot. 27 to hit. And that does ten
points of damage. And then I'm gonna take another

02:35:38.949 --> 02:35:45.716
shot at him, I'm going to take a fire shot. And
I'm gonna take a negative five to hit.

02:35:45.716 --> 02:35:48.093
And that's 14.

02:35:48.093 --> 02:35:49.421
MATT: Hits.

02:35:49.421 --> 02:36:00.127
TALIESIN: So that's 15 plus-- that's 23 points of
damage plus three points of fire damage.

02:36:00.127 --> 02:36:02.080
MATT: 26, nice.

02:36:02.080 --> 02:36:04.500
TRAVIS: Yeah, boy. Perce!

02:36:04.500 --> 02:36:05.291
MARISHA: On the little ooze?

02:36:05.291 --> 02:36:06.274
ASHLEY: 26 points of damage?

02:36:06.274 --> 02:36:07.138
LAURA: Woot woot!

02:36:07.138 --> 02:36:08.020
TRAVIS: Wow!

02:36:08.020 --> 02:36:08.741
TALIESIN: Plus fire.

02:36:08.741 --> 02:36:09.640
LAURA: Plus fire.

02:36:09.640 --> 02:36:10.884
TRAVIS: Get on it, nasty.

02:36:10.884 --> 02:36:11.728
LIAM: Pow, pow, pow, pow.

02:36:11.728 --> 02:36:13.207
MATT: All right, that brings us to Keyleth.

02:36:13.207 --> 02:36:14.553
MARISHA: All the oozes are still alive?

02:36:14.553 --> 02:36:16.079
MATT: Yeah.

02:36:16.079 --> 02:36:19.323
MARISHA: Damn oozes. All right. I'm gonna do
something crafty.

02:36:19.323 --> 02:36:20.444
TRAVIS: Yeah!

02:36:20.444 --> 02:36:21.698
ASHLEY: Get it!

02:36:21.698 --> 02:36:23.582
MATT: Gotta eat sometime, guys.

02:36:23.582 --> 02:36:28.103
MARISHA: I'm gonna bamf into an eagle.

02:36:28.103 --> 02:36:29.480
MATT: All right.

02:36:29.480 --> 02:36:34.618
MARISHA: I'm gonna fly over-- I think I'm going to
land right by here.

02:36:34.618 --> 02:36:35.454
MATT: There?

02:36:35.454 --> 02:36:36.198
MARISHA: Uh-huh.

02:36:36.198 --> 02:36:36.863
MATT: All right.

02:36:36.863 --> 02:36:39.507
MARISHA: And I'm gonna do Thunder Wave. Which
is--

02:36:39.507 --> 02:36:40.998
MATT: So you're coming out of eagle form?

02:36:40.998 --> 02:36:42.938
MARISHA: So I'm coming out of eagle form. I was
just using the eagle to fly.

02:36:42.938 --> 02:36:44.708
MATT: Okay, okay.

02:36:44.708 --> 02:36:47.326
MARISHA: Coming out of eagle form, and I'm gonna
do my thunderpush.

02:36:47.326 --> 02:36:53.866
So I take my staff and I throw it down. Kerplash.

02:36:53.866 --> 02:36:54.625
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:36:54.625 --> 02:36:55.720
MARISHA: Today it's kerplash.

02:36:55.720 --> 02:36:56.534
TRAVIS: I buy kerplash.

02:36:56.534 --> 02:36:58.232
MARISHA: Kerplash!

02:36:58.232 --> 02:36:59.310
TALIESIN: Okay.

02:36:59.310 --> 02:37:02.156
MATT: All right! So what is the radius effect on
that?

02:37:02.156 --> 02:37:08.609
MARISHA: It's a 15-foot cube and it pushes
everything ten feet away from me. Directly away.

02:37:08.609 --> 02:37:12.205
MATT: 15-foot cube, okay. So like this cube here?

02:37:12.205 --> 02:37:16.175
MARISHA: Sure. Yeah, a cube in front of me.

02:37:16.175 --> 02:37:19.296
MATT: All right, cool. So, they both get saving
throws.

02:37:19.296 --> 02:37:21.499
MARISHA: Not Grog, though. I'm gonna just--

02:37:21.499 --> 02:37:26.761
MATT: You can do that. Okay, neither makes their
saving throw. So go ahead and roll damage,

02:37:26.761 --> 02:37:28.214
or whatever it does.

02:37:28.214 --> 02:37:29.593
MARISHA: 2d8.

02:37:29.593 --> 02:37:32.351
MATT: 2d8 to each. What is the damage type on
that?

02:37:32.351 --> 02:37:36.591
MARISHA: Six. It just says damage and then they're
pushed. I was--

02:37:36.591 --> 02:37:38.469
MATT: Okay. So I'll go ahead and say it's thunder
damage. All right,

02:37:38.469 --> 02:37:39.543
so they're pushed how long? Ten feet?

02:37:39.543 --> 02:37:42.132
MARISHA: Ten feet. Directly away from me.

02:37:42.132 --> 02:37:44.318
MATT: Yeah. So they're pushed right there. Got
it.

02:37:44.318 --> 02:37:46.690
MARISHA: I was hoping they would go into the
lava.

02:37:46.690 --> 02:37:50.622
MATT: Unfortunately, it's not far enough. Is that
your turn?

02:37:50.622 --> 02:37:51.573
MARISHA: Yep!

02:37:51.573 --> 02:37:53.796
MATT: All right. Pike!

02:37:53.796 --> 02:38:03.519
ASHLEY: Okay, can I sprinter's boot over to Grog?
Sorry, no glasses, guys.

02:38:03.519 --> 02:38:06.177
So I don't see where I am.

02:38:06.177 --> 02:38:08.102
TRAVIS: A boot?

02:38:08.102 --> 02:38:09.218
MATT: You can, yes.

02:38:09.218 --> 02:38:13.893
ASHLEY: Okay, so I'm going to Cure Wounds.

02:38:13.893 --> 02:38:14.946
MATT: All right.

02:38:14.946 --> 02:38:17.951
ASHLEY: 'Cause that's what I do.

02:38:17.951 --> 02:38:19.324
MATT: It's what you do as a healer, yo.

02:38:19.324 --> 02:38:24.006
ASHLEY: So let's see, 1d8 plus spell damage. Wait,
so I'm gonna do it at fourth level, so that means

02:38:24.006 --> 02:38:25.310
I can roll how many times?

02:38:25.310 --> 02:38:27.714
MATT: 4d8.

02:38:27.714 --> 02:38:29.149
ASHLEY: Okay, so--

02:38:29.149 --> 02:38:30.537
MATT: Plus five.

02:38:30.537 --> 02:38:34.270
ASHLEY: Five, eight, 16.

02:38:34.270 --> 02:38:40.299
LAURA: Ooh! That's good! 24?

02:38:40.299 --> 02:38:42.954
ASHLEY: 24. So you heal 24.

02:38:42.954 --> 02:38:44.094
TRAVIS: Thank you!

02:38:44.094 --> 02:38:45.127
MATT: Nice.

02:38:45.127 --> 02:38:46.433
ASHLEY: And then--

02:38:46.433 --> 02:38:48.389
LAURA: Plus, do you add that to anything?

02:38:48.389 --> 02:38:51.295
ASHLEY: Well, he adds it to his 14 that he already
has.

02:38:51.295 --> 02:38:52.768
MATT: Sorry.

02:38:52.768 --> 02:38:57.960
ASHLEY: And then, can I do anything else while I'm
there?

02:38:57.960 --> 02:39:03.610
MATT: No, bonus action to do the item, move,
action to cast the spell.

02:39:03.610 --> 02:39:05.099
ORION: No.

02:39:05.099 --> 02:39:06.627
ASHLEY: Okay.

02:39:06.627 --> 02:39:07.391
MATT: So that's your turn.

02:39:07.391 --> 02:39:08.052
ASHLEY: Okay.

02:39:08.052 --> 02:39:10.446
MATT: Well done. All right, that brings us to
Grog.

02:39:10.446 --> 02:39:13.836
TRAVIS: Right, yeah. I would like to come out of
my rage.

02:39:13.836 --> 02:39:15.795
MATT: All right. So it's level two exhaustion.

02:39:15.795 --> 02:39:17.474
TRAVIS: For the first time ever.

02:39:17.474 --> 02:39:18.450
LAURA: Ever.

02:39:18.450 --> 02:39:20.788
LIAM: Wow. Not sure how I feel about that.

02:39:20.788 --> 02:39:27.517
TRAVIS: What do you-- where do you wanna go?
Towards Keyleth or toward the-- Okay. I'd like to

02:39:27.517 --> 02:39:35.741
pick up Pike and run balls over this way.

02:39:35.741 --> 02:39:36.543
MATT: Okay.

02:39:36.543 --> 02:39:37.886
TRAVIS: Right towards this area.

02:39:37.886 --> 02:39:38.694
MATT: Okay.

02:39:38.694 --> 02:39:40.065
LIAM: I'm all on my own.

02:39:40.065 --> 02:39:44.692
TRAVIS: Well, yeah, look. It nearly killed me the
one time I hit it.

02:39:44.692 --> 02:39:47.286
ORION: You shouldn't be doing melee on things that
can split in half to begin with.

02:39:47.286 --> 02:39:48.452
LAURA: We're gonna die.

02:39:48.452 --> 02:39:50.994
MATT: All right, so you pick up Pike. Level two
exhaustion, your speed is halved.

02:39:50.994 --> 02:39:51.781
LAURA: Oh no.

02:39:51.781 --> 02:39:52.742
TRAVIS: Okay.

02:39:52.742 --> 02:39:53.796
MATT: So you can only move 20 feet.

02:39:53.796 --> 02:39:54.442
TRAVIS: Right.

02:39:54.442 --> 02:39:55.317
ORION: You messed everything up.

02:39:55.317 --> 02:39:56.631
LIAM: Hey man, if I can't be a hero here, where am
I gonna do it?

02:39:56.631 --> 02:39:57.603
ORION: Oh, every other time is fine.

02:39:57.603 --> 02:39:58.954
TRAVIS: Do you want to stay? It doesn't really
matter.

02:39:58.954 --> 02:40:00.312
MATT: You grab her, you turn--

02:40:00.312 --> 02:40:01.325
TRAVIS: You want to stay over there?

02:40:01.325 --> 02:40:02.383
MATT: -- run that way?

02:40:02.383 --> 02:40:03.389
TRAVIS: You know what? I'll--

02:40:03.389 --> 02:40:07.703
MARISHA: Aim for in front of the Scientology
Center. It always goes over really well.

02:40:07.703 --> 02:40:09.544
TRAVIS: Do you just wanna stay?

02:40:09.638 --> 02:40:10.795
ASHLEY: I'm gonna-- I'll stay, I'll stay.

02:40:10.795 --> 02:40:14.971
TRAVIS: I'll leave Pike where she is and I'll run
up and flank Iceberg Lobsterface.

02:40:14.971 --> 02:40:15.853
MATT: Right there?

02:40:15.853 --> 02:40:16.572
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:40:16.572 --> 02:40:17.941
MATT: Okay, so, that's as far as you can get,
unfortunately--

02:40:17.941 --> 02:40:18.791
TRAVIS: Okay.

02:40:18.791 --> 02:40:20.181
MATT: -- 'cause you're double-fatigued.

02:40:20.181 --> 02:40:21.549
TALIESIN: My name in high school.

02:40:21.549 --> 02:40:23.154
MATT: As you run past, both of those slimes--

02:40:23.154 --> 02:40:23.951
ASHLEY: Double?

02:40:23.951 --> 02:40:24.749
MARISHA: Double-fatigue?

02:40:24.749 --> 02:40:26.062
TALIESIN: Iceberg Lobsterface.

02:40:26.062 --> 02:40:27.931
MATT: -- flash out with pseudopods, as reactions.

02:40:27.931 --> 02:40:29.121
LIAM: I'm surrounded by shit.

02:40:29.121 --> 02:40:30.542
TALIESIN: It's what all the kids called me.

02:40:30.542 --> 02:40:31.631
MATT: So, two attacks against you.

02:40:31.631 --> 02:40:32.411
TALIESIN: Long story.

02:40:32.411 --> 02:40:33.309
MATT: That's a 22.

02:40:33.309 --> 02:40:33.947
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:40:33.947 --> 02:40:34.707
ASHLEY: Fuck!

02:40:34.707 --> 02:40:35.608
MATT: And a 19.

02:40:35.608 --> 02:40:36.422
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:40:36.422 --> 02:40:39.135
MATT: All right, so both slam you for 24 points of
bludgeoning damage.

02:40:39.135 --> 02:40:40.313
You're not raged, so it's not halved.

02:40:40.313 --> 02:40:40.990
TRAVIS: Okay.

02:40:40.990 --> 02:40:41.825
LAURA: Ugh.

02:40:41.825 --> 02:40:48.386
MATT: So 24 against you, with an additional 56
points of acid damage.

02:40:48.386 --> 02:40:49.148
ASHLEY: Wait! What?

02:40:49.148 --> 02:40:53.176
TRAVIS: Unconscious!

02:40:53.176 --> 02:40:56.693
TALIESIN: Damn it.

02:40:56.693 --> 02:40:58.551
LAURA: Why didn't you get acid damage?

02:40:58.551 --> 02:40:59.569
MARISHA: Son of a bitch.

02:40:59.569 --> 02:41:03.081
MATT: They haven't hit him yet. That was just Grog
running away.

02:41:03.188 --> 02:41:03.841
LAURA: Oh.

02:41:03.841 --> 02:41:08.047
MATT: Both of them getting attacks of opportunity
on him, and both hitting.

02:41:08.047 --> 02:41:09.747
LIAM: I am surrounded by shit.

02:41:09.747 --> 02:41:10.880
ASHLEY: Guys, guys, guys.

02:41:10.880 --> 02:41:14.618
MATT: Grog falls face-first, right next-- right,
like, literally cradling-- His unconscious body is

02:41:14.618 --> 02:41:16.527
cradling the two dead ogres right now.

02:41:16.527 --> 02:41:17.554
LAURA: No!

02:41:17.554 --> 02:41:21.263
MATT: This slight sound of 'sss' as the acid is,
like, sizzling and scarring his flesh.

02:41:21.263 --> 02:41:23.543
LAURA: Nobody attack the things up close!

02:41:23.543 --> 02:41:25.898
MATT: That brings us to their turn.

02:41:25.898 --> 02:41:27.419
LAURA: Oh, no!

02:41:27.419 --> 02:41:30.100
LIAM: I'm going unconscious here, kids.

02:41:30.100 --> 02:41:32.546
LAURA: All of our heavy hitters are dead.

02:41:32.546 --> 02:41:38.542
MATT: These three oozes turn. Actually, this
one's going to move here--

02:41:38.542 --> 02:41:40.469
ASHLEY: Oh, hello!

02:41:40.469 --> 02:41:41.885
MATT: -- towards Pike.

02:41:41.885 --> 02:41:43.416
LIAM: (Tommy Wiseau voice) Oh, hi, Pike.

02:41:43.416 --> 02:41:44.384
(all laugh)

02:41:44.384 --> 02:41:45.981
MATT: You get an attack of opportunity on it, if
you like--

02:41:45.981 --> 02:41:46.873
LAURA: Oh, hit it!

02:41:46.873 --> 02:41:48.066
LIAM: Hit it? Yeah.

02:41:48.066 --> 02:41:49.440
MATT: -- as it slips away.

02:41:49.440 --> 02:41:50.220
LAURA: Get it!

02:41:50.220 --> 02:41:51.101
TALIESIN: Get it!

02:41:51.101 --> 02:41:52.238
LIAM: Do I have to roll to do that? Right?

02:41:52.238 --> 02:41:53.025
MATT: Yeah, you still have roll to hit it.

02:41:53.025 --> 02:41:54.116
LIAM: 26.

02:41:54.116 --> 02:41:54.940
MATT: Hits.

02:41:54.940 --> 02:41:56.263
LAURA: Why is it going up there?

02:41:56.263 --> 02:41:58.997
ASHLEY: You're gonna kill this thing!

02:41:58.997 --> 02:41:59.924
LIAM: 11.

02:41:59.924 --> 02:42:01.293
MATT: 11?

02:42:01.293 --> 02:42:02.071
LIAM: Yeah.

02:42:02.071 --> 02:42:02.914
MATT: Points of damage?

02:42:02.914 --> 02:42:04.323
LIAM: That's the damage. 11.

02:42:04.323 --> 02:42:05.126
MATT: Yeah.

02:42:05.126 --> 02:42:05.950
LIAM: Oh, yeah yeah yeah.

02:42:05.950 --> 02:42:07.423
MATT: All right, cool.

02:42:07.423 --> 02:42:10.093
ASHLEY: What did you guys vote on?

02:42:10.093 --> 02:42:11.382
MARISHA: No shit.

02:42:11.382 --> 02:42:12.433
LAURA: Did they vote on this?

02:42:12.433 --> 02:42:13.470
ASHLEY: Probably.

02:42:13.470 --> 02:42:15.702
MATT: So, the one that's attacking you, Pike, that
is a--

02:42:15.702 --> 02:42:16.897
LAURA: You guys suck.

02:42:16.897 --> 02:42:19.145
MATT: -- 23, versus armor class.

02:42:19.145 --> 02:42:20.839
ASHLEY: Yes, that hits.

02:42:20.839 --> 02:42:22.543
(all laugh)

02:42:22.543 --> 02:42:25.639
MATT: All right. You take 12 points of bludgeoning
damage from the impact of the pseudopod, with an

02:42:25.639 --> 02:42:27.367
additional 28 points of acid damage.

02:42:27.367 --> 02:42:29.212
LIAM: Son of a gun.

02:42:29.212 --> 02:42:30.162
MARISHA: Pseudopod?

02:42:30.162 --> 02:42:31.697
ASHLEY: Okay, so an additional 28 on top of that.

02:42:31.697 --> 02:42:33.059
TRAVIS: You guys are dicks.

02:42:33.059 --> 02:42:34.220
MATT: Yeah, so a total of 40 points of damage from
the strike.

02:42:34.220 --> 02:42:35.185
ASHLEY: I understand.

02:42:35.185 --> 02:42:36.412
MARISHA: Did he just call it a 'pseudopod'?

02:42:36.412 --> 02:42:41.059
LIAM: Masochists.

02:42:41.059 --> 02:42:43.189
MATT: The other two are going to attack you.

02:42:43.189 --> 02:42:44.628
LIAM: Sure they are.

02:42:44.628 --> 02:42:47.299
MATT: That's going to be a 19 versus armor class.

02:42:47.299 --> 02:42:52.111
LIAM: Yeah, that hits 'cause I'm at 19. Right? So
that hits if I'm at 19?

02:42:52.111 --> 02:42:55.699
MATT: It hits. Yeah. Okay. The other one is a 14,
so that misses.

02:42:55.699 --> 02:42:57.478
LIAM: Okay, so I use Uncanny Dodge on the one that
hit.

02:42:57.478 --> 02:42:58.358
MARISHA: Oh!

02:42:58.358 --> 02:42:59.224
MATT: All right. So.

02:42:59.224 --> 02:42:59.909
TALIESIN: Nice!

02:42:59.909 --> 02:43:00.739
LIAM: Whoa!

02:43:00.739 --> 02:43:01.602
MARISHA: Yeah you do.

02:43:01.602 --> 02:43:02.998
MATT: As you pull that away, you-- You take
half-damage from the strike?

02:43:02.998 --> 02:43:03.917
LIAM: Half-damage. That's right.

02:43:03.917 --> 02:43:06.727
MATT: All right, so that's-- this was a 40. Take
20 points of damage, total,

02:43:06.727 --> 02:43:07.767
from the bludgeoning and the acid.

02:43:07.767 --> 02:43:10.095
LIAM: Oh, I am rough, kids. I am rough.

02:43:10.095 --> 02:43:11.826
LAURA: Plus acid?

02:43:11.826 --> 02:43:13.798
MATT: All right. That ends their turn.

02:43:13.869 --> 02:43:17.811
LAURA: Oh my god.

02:43:17.811 --> 02:43:19.868
MATT: Clarota--

02:43:19.868 --> 02:43:21.648
LAURA: Clarota, save us!

02:43:21.648 --> 02:43:22.959
MATT: -- is going to step forward to there.

02:43:22.959 --> 02:43:24.785
LIAM: Use your magic, you strange flayer, you.

02:43:24.785 --> 02:43:25.866
LAURA: Do not use Lightning Bolt.

02:43:25.866 --> 02:43:26.917
MARISHA: Yeah. No Lightning Bolt, Clarota.

02:43:26.917 --> 02:43:31.412
MATT: Clarota reaches forward, uses his own--
Taking a note from Tiberius, uses his Telekinesis

02:43:31.412 --> 02:43:38.330
spell. The arcanist marks on its body flare up,
and as it does you can see this large creature--

02:43:38.330 --> 02:43:39.415
LAURA: Yeah.

02:43:39.415 --> 02:43:43.155
MATT: -- gets lifted up, and slams on top of this
hook horror--

02:43:43.155 --> 02:43:43.888
ORION: Yes!

02:43:43.888 --> 02:43:44.872
LIAM: That's awesome.

02:43:44.872 --> 02:43:47.116
MATT: -- pushing it further into the lava and
doing additional

02:43:47.116 --> 02:43:48.886
acid damage to the hook horror, which--

02:43:48.886 --> 02:43:50.675
LAURA: Yeah! And it dies?

02:43:50.675 --> 02:43:52.604
ORION: Damn hook whores!

02:43:52.604 --> 02:43:53.891
LIAM: (Cosby voice) You see--

02:43:53.891 --> 02:43:57.437
MATT: -- which completely dissolves and melts the
hook horror.

02:43:57.437 --> 02:43:59.191
(all cheer)

02:43:59.191 --> 02:44:01.225
TRAVIS: All right, Clarence!

02:44:01.225 --> 02:44:06.139
MATT: As it pushes down, the ooze just touches the
edge of the lava, not taking full damage from the

02:44:06.139 --> 02:44:08.554
impact, but just enough from the portion of it.

02:44:08.554 --> 02:44:09.847
LIAM (Jimmy Stewart voice) Clarence! Clarence!

02:44:09.847 --> 02:44:17.916
MATT: Taking an additional five points of fire
damage. All right, it's that one there. Great. All

02:44:17.916 --> 02:44:24.588
right, that brings us to the hook horror's turn,
who is currently dominated by Scanlan. Is going to

02:44:24.588 --> 02:44:28.320
rush forward to the edge here, and strike twice at
the--

02:44:28.320 --> 02:44:29.434
LAURA: Yeah, Scanlan!

02:44:29.434 --> 02:44:35.806
MATT: -- creature in the lava. Both hit.

02:44:35.806 --> 02:44:36.971
TRAVIS: Yes!

02:44:36.971 --> 02:44:38.169
LAURA: I'm full.

02:44:38.169 --> 02:44:51.870
MATT: It's prone. That deals six plus 14. Eight.
All right. The hook horror that Scanlan's

02:44:51.870 --> 02:44:57.911
controlling slams its hooks down into the ooze,
causing the ooze to get pushed further into the

02:44:57.911 --> 02:45:02.197
lava. As you see its form begin to dissipate and
slowly disintegrate into the pool of lava.

02:45:02.197 --> 02:45:03.989
LAURA: Yeah!

02:45:03.989 --> 02:45:08.121
MATT: Leaving this dark, cooled kind of surface
element to it. Slowly breaking apart,

02:45:08.121 --> 02:45:09.717
dissipating over the magma.

02:45:09.717 --> 02:45:10.742
ASHLEY: Bye, bitch.

02:45:10.742 --> 02:45:14.292
MATT: End of its turn, it's going to try and make
a saving throw against the domination effect.

02:45:14.292 --> 02:45:21.718
Rolls a natural 20. Breaks the effect, however I
feel like it did its good for the turn.

02:45:21.718 --> 02:45:25.454
LAURA: Damn it. Did he take acid damage? Is he
hurt?

02:45:25.454 --> 02:45:27.119
MATT: Yeah, he did. He took 20 points of acid
damage from each strike.

02:45:27.119 --> 02:45:28.372
LAURA: Nice. Good, good, good.

02:45:28.372 --> 02:45:29.474
ASHLEY: So there is only one left?

02:45:29.474 --> 02:45:30.715
LAURA: No, there is two little oozes and a big
one.

02:45:30.715 --> 02:45:31.967
LIAM: Two oozes and a monster man.

02:45:31.967 --> 02:45:34.592
MATT: All right, that brings us to the top of the
turn. Tiberius, you're up.

02:45:34.683 --> 02:45:38.689
ORION: Ah very well. I scooch myself a little bit
over behind him.

02:45:38.689 --> 02:45:41.757
MARISHA: (sings) One little two little three
little oozes.

02:45:41.757 --> 02:45:43.068
MATT: Over here?

02:45:43.068 --> 02:45:48.619
ORION: Yeah, that's good, I can see his fanny from
here. I'm going to cast Glacial Blast again, but

02:45:48.619 --> 02:45:53.511
I'm going to form a giant spike once more and jam
it right in his asshole.

02:45:53.511 --> 02:45:56.254
LIAM: Oh, he's pulling a Vax.

02:45:56.254 --> 02:45:59.615
ORION: And I'm going to try and catapult it right
where it's over. Because it's still at the edge of

02:45:59.615 --> 02:46:01.140
the lava pool, right?

02:46:01.140 --> 02:46:07.268
MATT: Mm-hm. So you're going to glacial spike in
the-- Kancho him. Magically kancho.

02:46:07.268 --> 02:46:09.705
ORION: Magic ice kancho blast.

02:46:09.705 --> 02:46:12.941
MATT: Arcane cheat code. All right. So go ahead
and roll to attack.

02:46:12.941 --> 02:46:15.158
LIAM: Up up down down left right left right.

02:46:15.158 --> 02:46:16.456
TRAVIS: A B A B N.

02:46:16.456 --> 02:46:21.043
ORION: 24.

02:46:21.043 --> 02:46:23.661
MATT: That definitely hits. Go ahead and roll
damage.

02:46:23.661 --> 02:46:39.845
ORION: Yeah. One, two, three, four, six. That is
eight. What is that, a 12? 15, 16, 18, 19.

02:46:40.077 --> 02:46:41.749
20. 20 damage.

02:46:41.749 --> 02:46:47.380
MATT: 20 damage? All right, and he's grappled,
correct?

02:46:47.380 --> 02:46:49.457
ORION: I'm not trying to grapple him, I'm trying
to just push him.

02:46:49.457 --> 02:46:50.791
MATT: Push him? Shove?

02:46:50.791 --> 02:46:51.694
ORION: Yeah.

02:46:51.694 --> 02:46:53.203
LAURA: Into the lava.

02:46:53.203 --> 02:46:56.759
ORION: Because he's like swinging at that dude so
I'm like up his keister.

02:46:56.759 --> 02:46:58.239
MATT: All right. All right. So he does make his
saving throw.

02:46:58.239 --> 02:46:59.122
ORION: Okay.

02:46:59.122 --> 02:47:03.469
MATT: Unfortunately, so it doesn't push him into
the lava, but it does slam him and does a shit-ton

02:47:03.676 --> 02:47:04.966
of damage to him, so.

02:47:05.036 --> 02:47:06.506
ORION: Nice.

02:47:06.506 --> 02:47:07.433
MARISHA: In his pooper.

02:47:07.433 --> 02:47:08.541
MATT: Looking rough. Just a little bit.

02:47:08.541 --> 02:47:11.031
ORION: Yeah. I'll spend another two points.

02:47:11.031 --> 02:47:12.786
MATT: How many points do you have now?

02:47:12.786 --> 02:47:13.939
ORION: After this, I'll have five.

02:47:13.939 --> 02:47:15.247
MATT: Okay.

02:47:15.247 --> 02:47:16.868
ORION: Because we had the rest, I regenerated all
my stuff.

02:47:16.868 --> 02:47:17.948
MATT: Right. Right.

02:47:17.948 --> 02:47:19.928
ORION: So I spent two already.

02:47:19.928 --> 02:47:20.864
TRAVIS: He's making trouble.

02:47:20.864 --> 02:47:24.135
ORION: I spent another two on the fight. And I'm
going to do another one. Up his ass again.

02:47:24.135 --> 02:47:25.934
MATT: All right, go ahead and roll for that.

02:47:25.934 --> 02:47:28.254
ORION: Yeah. 20.

02:47:28.254 --> 02:47:29.622
MATT: Uh-huh.

02:47:29.622 --> 02:47:32.443
MARISHA: Uh-huh.

02:47:32.443 --> 02:47:42.489
ORION: Yeah and that is 15. 15 points of damage.

02:47:42.489 --> 02:47:45.963
MATT: Makes his saving throw again, unfortunately.
It does not push him. Does additional points of

02:47:45.963 --> 02:47:49.792
damage. He's looking really rough. You can see
now, this ice has encrusted

02:47:49.792 --> 02:47:51.217
around the outside of its armor.

02:47:51.217 --> 02:47:52.369
ORION: And his butt.

02:47:52.369 --> 02:47:55.927
MATT: And where the wounds from the impact are,
there's cracking

02:47:55.927 --> 02:48:00.064
shards of ice crystal jutting outward.

02:48:00.064 --> 02:48:01.961
ORION: From his arsehole.

02:48:01.961 --> 02:48:11.272
MATT: From his asshole. Scanlan's turn. Should
have had your sheet, Scanlan. Scanlan's going to

02:48:11.272 --> 02:48:15.152
go ahead and, for the hell of it, run up and make
an attack.

02:48:15.152 --> 02:48:17.390
(all laugh)

02:48:17.390 --> 02:48:18.702
TRAVIS: Eff him up, Scanlan.

02:48:18.702 --> 02:48:19.694
ASHLEY: Let's go, Scanlan.

02:48:19.694 --> 02:48:23.946
MATT: Why not? Pulling out, his singing sword
arches in the air, and begins humming to it as he

02:48:23.946 --> 02:48:28.084
walks upon-- The humming kind of adds this
vibration element, like a tuning fork blade, as he

02:48:28.084 --> 02:48:31.963
arcs the sword down.

02:48:31.963 --> 02:48:37.444
MATT: A natural 18. I'm going to assume that hits.
That's going to be a 1d8 longsword damage. That's

02:48:37.444 --> 02:48:42.872
an 8 plus-- 12 points of damage.

02:48:42.872 --> 02:48:43.828
LAURA: Woo, Scanlan.

02:48:43.828 --> 02:48:44.942
TRAVIS and MARISHA: Yeah, Scanlan.

02:48:44.942 --> 02:48:46.265
ASHLEY: Go Scanlan.

02:48:46.265 --> 02:48:52.527
MATT: The blade swings down to where the ice has
encrusted the back of its armored shell. Scanlan

02:48:52.527 --> 02:48:56.823
takes the blade, swings it down, and pierces it
directly into where that ice has gathered. As it

02:48:56.823 --> 02:49:03.262
does, it cracks open the back of its armored
shell. Almost peeling it open like a shrimp. You

02:49:03.262 --> 02:49:08.501
can now see all its fleshy innards are exposed
to the outside. It's looking extremely, extremely

02:49:08.570 --> 02:49:11.488
close to death. It's screaming in pain, kind of
thrashing about now.

02:49:11.488 --> 02:49:12.818
LIAM: Shrimping, cool.

02:49:12.818 --> 02:49:14.480
MATT: Vex, you're up.

02:49:14.480 --> 02:49:18.094
LAURA: Okay. I'm gonna Lightning Bolt the bad
guy.

02:49:18.094 --> 02:49:19.480
MATT: This guy?

02:49:19.480 --> 02:49:20.489
LAURA: Yeah.

02:49:20.489 --> 02:49:21.209
MATT: All right.

02:49:21.209 --> 02:49:23.331
LAURA: Oh wait, no, I should save my brother.

02:49:23.331 --> 02:49:24.091
LIAM: Maybe.

02:49:24.091 --> 02:49:26.129
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to attack one of the oozies
instead.

02:49:26.129 --> 02:49:27.063
LIAM: The one right behind me.

02:49:27.063 --> 02:49:28.356
LAURA: The one right behind him.

02:49:28.356 --> 02:49:30.727
MATT: All right. Go ahead and roll for attack.

02:49:30.727 --> 02:49:36.574
LAURA: Yeah. Yeah, 23.

02:49:36.574 --> 02:49:39.469
MATT: Very nice, very nice, that hits

02:49:39.469 --> 02:49:42.598
LAURA: Oh I Hunter's Mark him first. Bonus.

02:49:42.598 --> 02:49:44.076
ORION: Bonus.

02:49:44.076 --> 02:49:46.614
LIAM: Excellent.

02:49:46.614 --> 02:49:49.533
LAURA: 14 for the first attack.

02:49:49.533 --> 02:49:52.705
ASHLEY: Wait, do we still have Scanlan's
inspiration song?

02:49:52.705 --> 02:49:53.756
MATT: You do, yeah.

02:49:53.756 --> 02:49:54.912
LIAM: You do. You have the die.

02:49:54.912 --> 02:49:57.339
ASHLEY: I have the die. Is what I'm talking about,
sorry.

02:49:57.339 --> 02:50:01.950
LAURA: Do I get six on both attacks? I do, don't
I?

02:50:01.950 --> 02:50:04.362
MATT: Mm-hm.

02:50:04.362 --> 02:50:06.236
LAURA: Yeah. 17 on the second attack.

02:50:06.236 --> 02:50:07.003
MATT: All right.

02:50:07.003 --> 02:50:09.605
LIAM: Kill it. Kill it.

02:50:09.605 --> 02:50:13.602
MATT: With a sickening (splat) sound, the ooze
splatters across the floor.

02:50:13.602 --> 02:50:15.135
LAURA: Yeah.

02:50:15.135 --> 02:50:16.229
LIAM: Thank you.

02:50:16.229 --> 02:50:19.418
MATT: Leaving a small, sizzling pool that's
scarring the rock below it. You can see it slowly

02:50:19.418 --> 02:50:23.868
depressing into the ground. You gonna stay where
you are?

02:50:23.868 --> 02:50:24.886
LAURA: Yeah.

02:50:24.886 --> 02:50:27.536
MATT: All right. That brings us to Vax.

02:50:27.536 --> 02:50:33.677
LIAM: All right. I walk back about 15 feet, and I
go (shnk-shnk). Throw daggers at it.

02:50:33.677 --> 02:50:34.797
MATT: Both daggers?

02:50:34.797 --> 02:50:36.523
LIAM: First one's a 15.

02:50:36.523 --> 02:50:37.263
MATT: That hits.

02:50:37.263 --> 02:50:43.676
LIAM: Okay and that is-- this is my keen dagger.
That is nine.

02:50:43.676 --> 02:50:45.951
MATT: Nine hits.

02:50:45.951 --> 02:50:48.862
LIAM: Second dagger. Definitely hits, that's a
26.

02:50:48.862 --> 02:50:51.399
MATT: Hits. None of them are Sneak Attack,
unfortunately.

02:50:51.399 --> 02:50:55.206
LIAM: That's fine. This is flametongue. I don't
know if fire helps, but that is an eight.

02:50:55.206 --> 02:50:56.416
So nine and an eight.

02:50:56.416 --> 02:51:02.521
MATT: Nine and an eight, gotcha. Both daggers
splash into it. You can see where they would

02:51:02.521 --> 02:51:04.581
slowly be scarred and damaged.

02:51:04.581 --> 02:51:06.865
LIAM: Except that they teleport back to my blink
belt.

02:51:06.865 --> 02:51:10.833
LAURA: Yay, blink belt.

02:51:10.833 --> 02:51:15.450
MATT: As they return to your belt, you can feel
there a slight bit of liquid left,

02:51:15.450 --> 02:51:16.927
and you shake it off quickly.

02:51:16.927 --> 02:51:18.074
LIAM: Shite.

02:51:18.074 --> 02:51:19.180
LAURA: (sings) Shake it off.

02:51:19.180 --> 02:51:21.842
MATT: But no other effect that that. It looks like
it's having a hard time keeping its form together.

02:51:21.842 --> 02:51:26.612
It's kind of shaking and (oozing sound) as it
moves. Still running towards Pike.

02:51:26.612 --> 02:51:28.185
LIAM: Finish that shit, Pike.

02:51:28.185 --> 02:51:29.420
MATT: That brings us to Percy.

02:51:29.420 --> 02:51:30.676
LIAM: Hit it.

02:51:30.676 --> 02:51:38.095
TALIESIN: All right. I'm just taking the shot.
Taking a shot with the bonus.

02:51:38.095 --> 02:51:40.856
So that's 14 to hit.

02:51:40.856 --> 02:51:41.817
MATT: Mm-hm.

02:51:41.817 --> 02:51:47.820
TALIESIN: That hits. So that's 18 points of
damage.

02:51:47.820 --> 02:51:50.139
MATT: All righty.

02:51:50.139 --> 02:51:52.761
TALIESIN: And I'm gonna take the other shot.

02:51:52.761 --> 02:51:56.315
MATT: Is this against the ooze?

02:51:56.315 --> 02:51:58.340
TALIESIN: Yeah, yeah. Sorry, the ooze.

02:51:58.340 --> 02:51:59.441
MATT: All right. Yep.

02:51:59.441 --> 02:52:00.643
TALIESIN: And that's 13 to hit.

02:52:00.643 --> 02:52:01.939
ASHLEY: Grog's unconscious?

02:52:01.939 --> 02:52:03.545
LIAM: He'll be fine in ten minutes, Pike.

02:52:03.545 --> 02:52:04.506
ASHLEY: What?

02:52:04.506 --> 02:52:05.654
LIAM: He's out of the fight, but he'll be fine.

02:52:05.654 --> 02:52:06.827
ASHLEY: Oh, okay.

02:52:06.827 --> 02:52:08.275
TALIESIN: And that's 11 points of damage.

02:52:08.275 --> 02:52:11.389
MATT: The first shot hits, and the ooze kind of
quivers. It leaves this kind of gaping hole, and

02:52:11.389 --> 02:52:15.234
it begins to slowly reform itself. Before it can,
you see the other weak spot where the top of its

02:52:15.234 --> 02:52:21.080
physical form is barely wavering, and it's able to
keep corporeal. You aim the second shot, and as

02:52:21.080 --> 02:52:26.479
you fire, it detonates and that portion of its
upper torso-- whatever it would be-- gets flung

02:52:26.479 --> 02:52:28.770
off and splats against the wall, the rest of it
slowly liquefying

02:52:28.770 --> 02:52:30.404
as the rest of the slime is destroyed.

02:52:30.404 --> 02:52:31.139
ASHLEY: Nice.

02:52:31.139 --> 02:52:31.992
TRAVIS: Yeah, buddy.

02:52:31.992 --> 02:52:33.359
LAURA: Yeah.

02:52:33.419 --> 02:52:34.911
TALIESIN: So I'm going to back up against the
wall.

02:52:34.911 --> 02:52:37.595
I'm going to back to the wall of the-- Yeah.

02:52:37.595 --> 02:52:40.054
MATT: Okay. Keyleth.

02:52:40.054 --> 02:52:45.159
MARISHA: Do I have enough speed to get next to Vex
there? 30 feet?

02:52:45.159 --> 02:52:46.841
MATT: Vax, you mean? Yeah, you do.

02:52:46.841 --> 02:52:48.202
MARISHA: Is that Vax?

02:52:48.202 --> 02:52:52.651
All right, once again, I'm going to
Thorn Whip this bitch.

02:52:52.742 --> 02:52:56.481
MATT: All right, go ahead and roll for attack.

02:52:56.481 --> 02:52:59.250
LIAM: (sings) Thorn Whip.

02:52:59.250 --> 02:53:00.376
MARISHA: 26.

02:53:00.376 --> 02:53:03.395
MATT: That hits, definitely, go ahead and roll
damage.

02:53:03.395 --> 02:53:12.019
LIAM: (sings) Thorn Whip, the bitch is dead.

02:53:12.019 --> 02:53:13.536
MARISHA: Eight points of damage.

02:53:13.631 --> 02:53:14.877
MATT: Okay.

02:53:14.946 --> 02:53:16.044
MARISHA: And I pull him--

02:53:16.044 --> 02:53:17.244
MATT: How do you want to do this?

02:53:17.244 --> 02:53:20.226
(all cheer)

02:53:20.226 --> 02:53:24.311
MATT: The creature is slashing about with its
claws.

02:53:24.311 --> 02:53:30.638
MARISHA: So I take my Thorn Whip, and I go (whip
sound). And I grab him. And I see he's still

02:53:30.638 --> 02:53:33.001
struggling. So I take another one and I go (whip
sound) on the other one.

02:53:33.001 --> 02:53:36.949
And I just go Spiderman-style.

02:53:36.949 --> 02:53:40.767
MATT: And (dragging sound). As you do it, it
plummets face-first into the--

02:53:40.767 --> 02:53:42.876
LAURA: Woo!

02:53:42.876 --> 02:53:46.815
MATT: -- both into the magma and the slightly
still-sizzling form left over

02:53:46.815 --> 02:53:48.161
from the ooze that had melted there.

02:53:48.161 --> 02:53:49.178
ORION: Magma and acid.

02:53:49.178 --> 02:53:54.299
MARISHA: And just for flavor, I take a big gust of
air, a big Wind Burst and I go (whoosh) down into

02:53:54.299 --> 02:53:57.611
the lava pool. Encrusting it all.

02:53:57.611 --> 02:54:02.725
MATT: As you do, it slams down. You hear it scream
underneath as its body begins to quiver. The Wind

02:54:02.725 --> 02:54:06.745
Burst hits, and the cool air rushes through the
tunnel. All of your guys' hair and everything gets

02:54:06.816 --> 02:54:08.994
blown back for a second. You have to cover your
eyes, and as you look back--

02:54:08.994 --> 02:54:11.134
(all laugh)

02:54:11.134 --> 02:54:13.037
MATT: The magma has cooled to a solid
rock-covering surface.

02:54:13.037 --> 02:54:15.400
As darkness falls back into the tunnel--

02:54:15.400 --> 02:54:17.266
ORION: Oh, Light!

02:54:17.266 --> 02:54:20.363
MATT: As Tiberius hits Light, in the tunnel you
can see the--

02:54:20.363 --> 02:54:21.427
LAURA: Grog!

02:54:21.427 --> 02:54:25.692
MATT: -- hook horror, which, a portion of its
upper torso is now encrusted

02:54:25.692 --> 02:54:27.503
into the actual cavern floor.

02:54:27.654 --> 02:54:28.434
LAURA: Awesome.

02:54:28.434 --> 02:54:29.239
TRAVIS: Amazing.

02:54:29.239 --> 02:54:30.162
LAURA: Save Grog!

02:54:30.162 --> 02:54:33.374
ASHLEY: I'm going to go over to Grog and Cure
Wounds at fourth level.

02:54:33.374 --> 02:54:34.890
MATT: All right.

02:54:34.890 --> 02:54:36.346
LIAM: You tried to kill us, but you failed.

02:54:36.346 --> 02:54:38.026
LAURA: Don't challenge them.

02:54:38.026 --> 02:54:38.763
ASHLEY: Don't.

02:54:38.763 --> 02:54:39.749
TALIESIN: Nice try.

02:54:39.749 --> 02:54:43.051
ASHLEY: Nice job, guys.

02:54:43.051 --> 02:54:44.493
TRAVIS: I did a pretty decent job, actually.

02:54:44.493 --> 02:54:47.647
MATT: I ate pizza in front of you guys. I don't
care. It was tasty. Thank you.

02:54:47.647 --> 02:54:49.008
ORION: Yeah.

02:54:49.008 --> 02:54:50.551
MARISHA: I don't care. No shame.

02:54:50.551 --> 02:54:58.042
MATT: Delicious pizza.

02:54:58.042 --> 02:55:06.101
LAURA: No. We're not gonna have Trinket this whole
thing. We better get back to Trinket soon.

02:55:06.101 --> 02:55:07.741
I'm freaking out, you guys.

02:55:07.741 --> 02:55:08.741
MARISHA: That's true, if we keep going.

02:55:08.741 --> 02:55:10.021
ASHLEY: 25 points of heal!

02:55:10.021 --> 02:55:10.874
LIAM: Just in seven more weeks.

02:55:10.874 --> 02:55:11.677
TRAVIS: Thank you!

02:55:11.677 --> 02:55:12.576
ASHLEY: You're welcome!

02:55:12.576 --> 02:55:13.502
MARISHA: I might be able to guide him--

02:55:13.502 --> 02:55:14.972
LIAM: Trinket's on the sidelines, man.

02:55:14.972 --> 02:55:16.797
LAURA: That makes me so sad!

02:55:16.797 --> 02:55:17.698
LIAM: We're not going back.

02:55:17.698 --> 02:55:18.722
LAURA: And it's all you guys' fault!

02:55:18.722 --> 02:55:22.431
LIAM: But it was like three years, Trinket was by
your side. This is the first time ever.

02:55:22.431 --> 02:55:24.173
MATT: As Grog, you come to consciousness again--

02:55:24.173 --> 02:55:27.738
TRAVIS: Ah! Did I kill it?

02:55:27.738 --> 02:55:29.706
LAURA: You did, Grog! Good job!

02:55:29.706 --> 02:55:30.799
TALIESIN: Yes, Grog, you killed it good.

02:55:30.799 --> 02:55:31.749
LAURA: Also, handful of pizza.

02:55:31.749 --> 02:55:32.937
TRAVIS: I put my hand in my pizza!

02:55:32.937 --> 02:55:34.118
(all laugh)

02:55:34.118 --> 02:55:37.043
LIAM: You killed them all, Grog! You were
magnificent!

02:55:37.043 --> 02:55:37.998
MARISHA: Yay, Grog!

02:55:37.998 --> 02:55:39.837
TRAVIS: Aha! Tell me more! (snores)

02:55:39.837 --> 02:55:42.513
(all laugh)

02:55:42.513 --> 02:55:43.657
ASHLEY: Wait--

02:55:43.657 --> 02:55:44.821
MARISHA: Now we pass out.

02:55:44.821 --> 02:55:46.624
ASHLEY: -- so can I also do a Mass Cure Wounds?
Since I just did a--

02:55:46.624 --> 02:55:48.547
MATT: Yeah, if you'd like!

02:55:48.547 --> 02:55:49.908
ASHLEY: Okay. So I'll also do a Mass Cure Wounds.

02:55:49.908 --> 02:55:50.823
LAURA: Yay!

02:55:50.823 --> 02:55:51.925
LIAM: Yes, 'cause I'm at four hit points.

02:55:51.925 --> 02:55:53.182
ASHLEY: Yeah, you're pretty bad.

02:55:53.182 --> 02:55:54.306
MARISHA: Oof.

02:55:54.306 --> 02:55:55.529
LAURA: Brother.

02:55:55.529 --> 02:55:56.521
TALIESIN: I'm fine.

02:55:56.521 --> 02:56:01.033
LIAM: Oh, brother, where art thou?

02:56:01.033 --> 02:56:02.439
ORION: I feel fine!

02:56:02.439 --> 02:56:03.303
LAURA: I feel fine.

02:56:03.303 --> 02:56:04.420
MARISHA: Ah, me too.

02:56:04.420 --> 02:56:05.617
TALIESIN: I feel fine.

02:56:05.617 --> 02:56:07.501
LIAM: Oh! Oh! Oh! Fancy you! Blah-blah-blah-blah!

02:56:07.501 --> 02:56:08.303
(all laugh)

02:56:08.303 --> 02:56:10.095
TALIESIN: Seems that there's one table where
everyone is perfectly reasonable!

02:56:10.095 --> 02:56:10.955
ORION: All the time, yes, Vax!

02:56:10.955 --> 02:56:14.178
LIAM: I'm at four hit points! You go fuck 
yourself.

02:56:14.248 --> 02:56:15.515
MARISHA: Yes, everyone on this side of the table's
good.

02:56:15.515 --> 02:56:16.836
ORION: There's an acid guy! Stab.

02:56:16.836 --> 02:56:18.014
(all laugh)

02:56:18.014 --> 02:56:24.503
LIAM: I was trying to save his ass! I was hurting
myself on purpose.

02:56:24.503 --> 02:56:27.479
MATT: All right. So, as you guys steel yourselves
for a moment, kind of

02:56:27.479 --> 02:56:31.901
recovering from that fateful encounter, you--

02:56:31.901 --> 02:56:34.982
ASHLEY: 22 points of healing--

02:56:34.982 --> 02:56:35.892
LAURA: To everyone.

02:56:35.892 --> 02:56:36.804
MATT: To everyone.

02:56:36.804 --> 02:56:37.676
LIAM: That's pretty good.

02:56:37.676 --> 02:56:38.488
MATT: Everyone heals 22 points of damage.

02:56:38.488 --> 02:56:39.354
LIAM: That's half-ish.

02:56:39.354 --> 02:56:40.270
TALIESIN: I reload.

02:56:40.270 --> 02:56:41.584
LAURA: Well done, well done.

02:56:41.584 --> 02:56:42.742
LIAM: Half-ish.

02:56:42.742 --> 02:56:43.963
ASHLEY: Something additional.

02:56:43.963 --> 02:56:44.917
TRAVIS: Thank you, Pike.

02:56:44.917 --> 02:56:46.986
ASHLEY: Oh, you're welcome, Grog! My best pal.

02:56:46.986 --> 02:56:48.825
TRAVIS: Hell yeah. (growling noises)

02:56:48.825 --> 02:56:50.111
ASHLEY: (growling noises)

02:56:50.111 --> 02:56:50.859
MATT: All right.

02:56:50.859 --> 02:56:53.909
(all laugh)

02:56:53.909 --> 02:56:55.288
TRAVIS: It's a language we speak.

02:56:55.288 --> 02:56:57.432
ASHLEY: Yeah, man, it's like our own thing.

02:56:57.432 --> 02:56:59.002
(all laugh)

02:56:59.002 --> 02:57:00.035
MATT: You guys push forward down the tunnel--

02:57:00.035 --> 02:57:00.732
LAURA: Oh!

02:57:00.732 --> 02:57:01.735
LIAM: Yes.

02:57:01.735 --> 02:57:03.828
LAURA: Limping.

02:57:03.828 --> 02:57:05.676
MATT: For another 20 or so minutes, bringing
yourself along,

02:57:05.676 --> 02:57:07.557
sore from the impact of the battle.

02:57:07.557 --> 02:57:08.785
LIAM: I'm burnt.

02:57:08.785 --> 02:57:15.101
MATT: Bits of your armor scarred. By the way, your
armor--

02:57:15.101 --> 02:57:15.966
LIAM: Yes.

02:57:15.966 --> 02:57:16.877
MATT: -- what type of armor was it?

02:57:16.877 --> 02:57:20.714
LIAM: It was-- it's magical. I found it in the
goblin city. Studded leather armor, plus two.

02:57:20.714 --> 02:57:25.903
MATT: All right. For the acidic nature of this--

02:57:25.903 --> 02:57:30.850
LIAM: Wait. Do you know what's funny? What's funny
is, the armor I had before this, that I wasn't

02:57:30.850 --> 02:57:35.334
paying attention to, was acid resistant! Isn't
that funny?

02:57:35.334 --> 02:57:36.412
MARISHA: And now you don't have it no more?

02:57:36.412 --> 02:57:37.328
LIAM: That's so funny!

02:57:37.328 --> 02:57:38.023
LAURA: That's great!

02:57:38.023 --> 02:57:38.781
MATT: Look at that!

02:57:38.781 --> 02:57:39.954
TRAVIS: That's really funny. Keep going.

02:57:39.954 --> 02:57:40.773
MARISHA: That is funny.

02:57:40.773 --> 02:57:41.621
LIAM: It's in my bag!

02:57:41.621 --> 02:57:42.873
MATT: You wipe it off. Thankfully, the magic
enchantment protects the armor entirely.

02:57:42.873 --> 02:57:43.998
LAURA: Ah! See! That was acid-resistant, too!

02:57:43.998 --> 02:57:45.022
MATT: Grog, what armor do you have?

02:57:45.022 --> 02:57:45.904
LIAM: Even better!

02:57:45.904 --> 02:57:47.967
TRAVIS: Oh, it's like hides and leathers and--

02:57:47.967 --> 02:57:48.686
MATT: Just regular hide.

02:57:48.686 --> 02:57:49.801
TRAVIS: Yep.

02:57:49.801 --> 02:57:53.656
MATT: Currently, as you're walking, you look down
and notice that the armor

02:57:53.656 --> 02:57:56.776
on your torso has near-completely dissolved.

02:57:56.776 --> 02:57:57.639
LAURA: (gasps)

02:57:57.639 --> 02:58:00.391
TRAVIS: Son of a-- Well, you're welcome, ladies!

02:58:00.391 --> 02:58:01.504
LAURA: My, my, Grog!

02:58:01.504 --> 02:58:03.146
TRAVIS: (sings) It's time for a show!

02:58:03.146 --> 02:58:04.586
ORION: Grog! Will you put those away!

02:58:04.586 --> 02:58:08.016
MATT: As it stands, you have no additional armor
class bonus for any armor.

02:58:08.016 --> 02:58:08.869
LAURA: Oh no!

02:58:08.869 --> 02:58:10.939
MATT: Your hide armor is gone. It is completely
dissolved.

02:58:10.939 --> 02:58:13.195
LAURA: What about the black armor? Put on the
dwarven black plate armor!

02:58:13.195 --> 02:58:14.452
TRAVIS: They're dwarves.

02:58:14.452 --> 02:58:17.057
ASHLEY: What if we melt it and then make it a big
one?

02:58:17.057 --> 02:58:19.037
LAURA: If it's magical, it might fit you if you
just try it on!

02:58:19.037 --> 02:58:20.107
ASHLEY: I don't know, would that work?

02:58:20.107 --> 02:58:20.911
ORION: It's true!

02:58:20.911 --> 02:58:24.430
LIAM: Hold on, hold on. DM! DM. I take off my
magical armor,

02:58:24.430 --> 02:58:26.586
which was dwarven in shape before--

02:58:26.586 --> 02:58:27.573
LAURA: (gasps) Oh, good!

02:58:27.573 --> 02:58:30.890
LIAM: -- but I take it off, it shrinks down to
like a little toddler--

02:58:30.890 --> 02:58:32.711
LAURA: Oh! Ew. Cover yourself, Vax!

02:58:32.711 --> 02:58:36.070
LIAM: I'm wearing, like, a Scientology unibody
underwear underneath--

02:58:36.070 --> 02:58:37.150
(all laugh)

02:58:37.150 --> 02:58:37.984
LAURA: Oh, okay.

02:58:37.984 --> 02:58:39.191
ASHLEY: Wouldn't that be-- that's mormons!

02:58:39.191 --> 02:58:40.419
LIAM: The armor shrinks down to like
toddler-size--

02:58:40.419 --> 02:58:41.491
ORION: I don't know what that means!

02:58:41.491 --> 02:58:42.541
LIAM: -- and I hand it to Grog.

02:58:42.541 --> 02:58:43.476
TALIESIN: It's probably for the best.

02:58:43.476 --> 02:58:47.034
LIAM: And I go to my pack and I take out my old
armor, which is acid resistant. Not quite as cool

02:58:47.034 --> 02:58:49.735
as what I was wearing, but I don't want him--

02:58:49.735 --> 02:58:50.977
TRAVIS: You had two pairs of gloves?

02:58:50.977 --> 02:58:52.278
LIAM: I can't-- huh?

02:58:52.278 --> 02:58:53.322
TRAVIS: Kidding. It's Dumb &amp;amp; Dumber.

02:58:53.322 --> 02:58:56.190
LIAM: I can't stare at his pecs for the next three
days, so I'll give him my armor.

02:58:56.190 --> 02:58:57.678
LAURA: I can.

02:58:57.678 --> 02:59:00.505
LIAM: Ooh! And put on what I had on before.

02:59:00.505 --> 02:59:05.624
MATT: All right. So you take a moment, and hand
him new armor, and Grog, this scarred, nearly

02:59:05.624 --> 02:59:09.056
naked goliath form, has been lumbering through
this hallway--

02:59:09.056 --> 02:59:10.345
TRAVIS: Ooh!

02:59:10.345 --> 02:59:11.545
MATT: Hoo! Modesty, Grog!

02:59:11.545 --> 02:59:13.067
(all laugh)

02:59:13.067 --> 02:59:14.277
MATT: You place the studded leather on--

02:59:14.277 --> 02:59:16.227
LIAM: Studded leather armor plus two, okay?

02:59:16.227 --> 02:59:17.480
MATT: So mark that for your AC.

02:59:17.480 --> 02:59:18.936
TRAVIS: Studded armor leather plus two.

02:59:18.936 --> 02:59:19.910
ASHLEY: Wait, but then what are--

02:59:19.910 --> 02:59:20.991
LAURA: He's got his own armor.

02:59:20.991 --> 02:59:22.345
LIAM: I've got my old armor. I found that armor
down here.

02:59:22.345 --> 02:59:24.504
TALIESIN: I'm gonna be the person who actually
examines the cart, at this point.

02:59:24.504 --> 02:59:25.535
MATT: Okay.

02:59:25.535 --> 02:59:26.508
MARISHA: Oh! That's a good idea.

02:59:26.508 --> 02:59:27.334
LAURA: Plus we have other plate armor!

02:59:27.334 --> 02:59:28.262
LIAM: That's a loaner.

02:59:28.262 --> 02:59:29.420
TALIESIN: You know, I just figured someone ought
to.

02:59:29.420 --> 02:59:30.616
MARISHA: What the fuck did we open?

02:59:30.616 --> 02:59:31.629
TRAVIS: Plus two to AC?

02:59:31.629 --> 02:59:32.338
LAURA: Yeah.

02:59:32.338 --> 02:59:33.188
TALIESIN: And it should be me.

02:59:33.188 --> 02:59:34.068
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:59:34.068 --> 02:59:35.096
LIAM: No, it's more complicated than that.

02:59:35.096 --> 02:59:36.533
MATT: Okay, here's the circumstance for you, real
fast, before we get to that. So, Grog.

02:59:36.533 --> 02:59:37.388
TRAVIS: Yep.

02:59:37.388 --> 02:59:43.120
MATT: The armor you had on was hide, which was a
dex bonus of 12 plus your dex. Studded leather is

02:59:43.120 --> 02:59:46.815
also the same, so your AC actually goes up.

02:59:46.815 --> 02:59:50.085
TRAVIS: Oh! Ho! Something that you'd think!

02:59:50.085 --> 02:59:51.563
MATT: So, what was your AC previously?

02:59:51.563 --> 02:59:52.309
TRAVIS: 18?

02:59:52.309 --> 02:59:53.143
MATT: 18?

02:59:53.143 --> 02:59:54.028
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:59:54.028 --> 02:59:55.296
MATT: It should now be 20.

02:59:55.296 --> 02:59:57.112
TRAVIS: Yay! Yes!

02:59:57.112 --> 02:59:58.213
LAURA: Yay, Grog!

02:59:58.213 --> 02:59:59.847
TRAVIS: Grog takes the top off and does a--

02:59:59.847 --> 03:00:02.180
LIAM: Loaner! Loaner.

03:00:02.180 --> 03:00:03.290
TALIESIN: Put it back on.

03:00:03.290 --> 03:00:04.489
LIAM: Loaner.

03:00:04.489 --> 03:00:07.868
LAURA: It's his, he's keeping it. It's going to
stink like Grog, you won't want that back.

03:00:07.868 --> 03:00:10.972
TRAVIS: The things I'm gonna do in this armor,
you're not going to want it back.

03:00:11.139 --> 03:00:15.638
Just give me and Scanlan one night to
break it in, and I promise you, it will be mine.

03:00:15.638 --> 03:00:17.559
MATT: Just the two of you?

03:00:17.559 --> 03:00:21.067
TRAVIS: Well, uh, you know what I mean. Who am I
talking to?

03:00:21.067 --> 03:00:27.137
MATT: All right, well, go ahead and roll an
investigation check.

03:00:27.137 --> 03:00:33.193
TALIESIN: An investigation check, what is that?
Eight.

03:00:33.193 --> 03:00:39.348
MATT: Okay. Looking at the cart, the cart is a
rickety wooden thing, but what was in the cart was

03:00:39.348 --> 03:00:46.682
a large glass unit, a containment unit that was
sealed off. You can see the inside of it has

03:00:46.682 --> 03:00:49.917
slight scarring to the glass, but it seems to be
resistant to whatever the loose creature was

03:00:49.917 --> 03:00:54.266
contained in it. Along the inside of the cart, you
notice there are a couple of just left over chunks

03:00:54.266 --> 03:00:59.535
of flesh of different colors, patches or pieces
you see, like part of a hand that's just in there.

03:00:59.535 --> 03:01:00.991
LAURA: Ew.

03:01:00.991 --> 03:01:05.803
MATT: Partially decomposed, to a certain extent.
It looks like these were either used to feed

03:01:05.803 --> 03:01:14.142
whatever the creature was in there or remnants of
some other strange collection. Based on the best

03:01:14.142 --> 03:01:19.850
you guys can ascertain, this creature was part of
the experimentation-type process that the weird

03:01:19.919 --> 03:01:22.232
naga creature you fought earlier came from.

03:01:22.232 --> 03:01:24.311
LAURA: Oh, great, so there could be more.

03:01:24.311 --> 03:01:25.743
TRAVIS: Did we search the ogres?

03:01:25.743 --> 03:01:27.232
LAURA: Yeah! Loot the ogres!

03:01:27.232 --> 03:01:33.035
MATT: Ogres are wearing nasty, nasty, tattered at
this point, hide armor

03:01:33.035 --> 03:01:34.775
LIAM: Grog could do it.

03:01:34.775 --> 03:01:38.474
MATT: They both carry total, amongst the two of
them, about 24 pieces of gold.

03:01:38.474 --> 03:01:39.241
LAURA: Sweet.

03:01:39.241 --> 03:01:40.207
TRAVIS: I wanna take it.

03:01:40.207 --> 03:01:41.369
LAURA: I add it to party funds.

03:01:41.369 --> 03:01:48.504
TRAVIS: I am searching the ogres, and I keep the
24 gold, but I give two to Vax.

03:01:48.710 --> 03:01:49.655
LIAM: Thank you.

03:01:49.655 --> 03:01:50.358
TRAVIS: You're welcome.

03:01:50.358 --> 03:01:52.536
MARISHA: Can I go and grab shards of the broken
glass of the case?

03:01:52.536 --> 03:01:56.795
MATT: If you'd like to, yeah. So mark that in your
inventory, you have some hand-sized shards of

03:01:56.795 --> 03:01:58.100
broken glass.

03:01:58.100 --> 03:01:59.339
TRAVIS: And two to Pike for healing me.

03:01:59.339 --> 03:02:00.895
ASHLEY: Oh, thanks.

03:02:00.895 --> 03:02:02.745
MATT: Anything else you guys wish to do in this
section?

03:02:02.817 --> 03:02:09.776
LIAM: So we searched the ogres, that's it. I guess
we should just start walking further down.

03:02:09.776 --> 03:02:12.148
TRAVIS: You take a poo on the black puddle of
acid?

03:02:12.148 --> 03:02:19.319
TALIESIN: I think-- Well, no. That's the only heat
source, that's the only lava there was, and now

03:02:19.319 --> 03:02:20.443
it's cool.

03:02:20.443 --> 03:02:21.256
MATT: And now it has cooled, yeah.

03:02:21.256 --> 03:02:22.240
TALIESIN: Okay, never mind, then.

03:02:22.240 --> 03:02:23.047
MARISHA: Sorry.

03:02:23.047 --> 03:02:24.428
TALIESIN: It's all right, I think it's worth it.

03:02:24.428 --> 03:02:25.558
TRAVIS: I'd like to take a hit dice.

03:02:25.558 --> 03:02:26.665
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and do that. As many as you'd
like.

03:02:26.665 --> 03:02:27.983
LIAM: Let's rest for a half-hour or so.

03:02:27.983 --> 03:02:28.724
LAURA: Yeah.

03:02:28.724 --> 03:02:33.986
MATT: Take a moment, you can spend any hit dice
now that you need to to heal yourself. Just make

03:02:33.986 --> 03:02:39.495
sure to mark how many you've used.

03:02:39.495 --> 03:02:43.843
TALIESIN: I just hear the sounds of ones.

03:02:43.843 --> 03:02:47.642
MATT: All right. As you guys take a moment to heal
yourselves, you pull yourselves back up to your

03:02:47.642 --> 03:02:56.202
feet, and you tread further down this tunnel.
Another 25-30 minutes of the slight curvature, and

03:02:56.202 --> 03:03:01.026
it gets steeper and steeper, until eventually it
opens up into a familiar cavern to some of you.

03:03:01.026 --> 03:03:04.405
You see a large waterfall pouring down from
above--

03:03:04.405 --> 03:03:05.548
ASHLEY: (gasps)

03:03:05.548 --> 03:03:06.871
LAURA: Mother bitches.

03:03:06.871 --> 03:03:08.941
MARISHA: It looped around?

03:03:08.941 --> 03:03:15.382
MATT: You are on the outskirts of where the next
tunnel opens up, where there are a few small

03:03:15.382 --> 03:03:20.312
streams of lava pouring from the ceiling. You look
above, and you can see the top of the downward

03:03:20.312 --> 03:03:23.695
cavern. There's the giant lake beneath. And across
the way, you can see the waterfall where Clarota

03:03:23.695 --> 03:03:25.692
was originally discovered.

03:03:25.692 --> 03:03:26.964
MARISHA: Well, we should go pick up Trinket.

03:03:26.964 --> 03:03:28.091
TALIESIN: At least you get your bear.

03:03:28.091 --> 03:03:29.354
LAURA: (gasps) Trinket!

03:03:29.354 --> 03:03:30.555
MARISHA: Let's go pick up Trinket.

03:03:30.555 --> 03:03:32.062
LAURA: Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah.

03:03:32.062 --> 03:03:34.115
TRAVIS: You're going to get your bear killed.

03:03:34.115 --> 03:03:36.110
LIAM: Can you explain? I don't think I understand.

03:03:36.110 --> 03:03:37.115
MARISHA: We left Trinket over there.

03:03:37.115 --> 03:03:38.281
LIAM: Can you explain with your map, Matt?

03:03:38.281 --> 03:03:38.904
MATT: Yes.

03:03:38.904 --> 03:03:39.711
MARISHA: We're at the bottom of the cave.

03:03:39.711 --> 03:03:40.655
ORION: We went down and just--

03:03:40.655 --> 03:03:42.934
LIAM: I get we doubled back, but it would help the
visual, I think.

03:03:42.934 --> 03:03:45.639
MATT: Yeah so-- and I'll have more of this for you
guys next week.

03:03:45.639 --> 03:03:46.915
TRAVIS: It was a warp tube.

03:03:46.915 --> 03:03:50.787
MATT: The path you guys took was essentially--
lead to this back area, which I'll draw for next

03:03:50.787 --> 03:03:57.660
week, and a tunnel that curved all the way around
and exited right there.

03:03:57.660 --> 03:03:58.720
LAURA: So we're--

03:03:58.720 --> 03:04:01.148
LIAM: All right, we'll go get your bear.

03:04:01.148 --> 03:04:04.150
LAURA: We'll go get Trinket, and then we'll go
down the path we should have gone down in the

03:04:04.150 --> 03:04:05.645
first place next week.

03:04:05.645 --> 03:04:06.545
MARISHA: Son of a bitch.

03:04:06.545 --> 03:04:07.489
TALIESIN: Except we get Trinket.

03:04:07.489 --> 03:04:08.555
LAURA: But Trinket!

03:04:08.555 --> 03:04:09.510
MARISHA: So it's not useless.

03:04:09.510 --> 03:04:10.906
LAURA: It was absolutely useless.

03:04:10.906 --> 03:04:11.859
LIAM: That's fate, that's kismet.

03:04:11.859 --> 03:04:12.926
MARISHA: Is there, like, any other way down here?

03:04:12.926 --> 03:04:15.834
MATT: Other than the fact you've completely
destroyed one of the mind flayer generals as well

03:04:15.834 --> 03:04:22.791
as the one helming the war camp above. You've
acquired new magical items and defeated one of the

03:04:22.791 --> 03:04:26.674
abominations that was created for the siege war. I
think you accomplished quite a few things, though

03:04:26.674 --> 03:04:28.095
maybe not as directly as you were hoping.

03:04:28.095 --> 03:04:29.330
TALIESIN: And we acquired our bear.

03:04:29.330 --> 03:04:30.598
LAURA: We got our bear back.

03:04:30.598 --> 03:04:35.256
MATT: All right, so you, taking the flying carpet,
it's a very precarious journey

03:04:35.256 --> 03:04:38.743
as the weight limit for the carpet--

03:04:38.743 --> 03:04:40.023
LIAM: You go on it, right?

03:04:40.023 --> 03:04:41.796
LAURA: He's with me, and he cast Featherfall.

03:04:41.796 --> 03:04:45.868
MATT: You can go ahead and cast Fly on your bear.
Trinket awkwardly (bear noises) manages to swim

03:04:45.868 --> 03:04:47.637
her way down to the bottom floor.

03:04:47.637 --> 03:04:49.188
LAURA: Come, Trinket, come.

03:04:49.188 --> 03:04:54.950
MATT: As you make your way to the base of the
watery lake, at the bottom, you can see a swish to

03:04:54.950 --> 03:05:01.638
the water, and a very familiar sight briefly shows
itself in the distance. As you see a slick domed

03:05:01.638 --> 03:05:06.988
fish-like head protrude with a few tentacles in
the distance, you all instinctively step quite a

03:05:06.988 --> 03:05:09.622
distance away, and it seems to withdraw back into
the water.

03:05:09.622 --> 03:05:11.879
MARISHA: Can I-- While I see it real quick, I'm
going to go ahead and channel

03:05:11.879 --> 03:05:14.054
and cast Beast Sense through it.

03:05:14.054 --> 03:05:16.893
MATT: Nothing bestial of it. This is not a natural
creature.

03:05:16.893 --> 03:05:18.510
MARISHA: Good to know.

03:05:18.510 --> 03:05:25.570
MATT: Clarota once again whispers to the rest of
you, "Stay at bay. The Aboleth is dangerous."

03:05:25.570 --> 03:05:26.832
LAURA: Aboleth?

03:05:26.832 --> 03:05:28.117
MARISHA: Aboleth.

03:05:28.117 --> 03:05:33.464
MATT: You all step back and turn now into the the
tunnel that extends further into the heart of this

03:05:33.464 --> 03:05:39.724
mountain. You see streams of lava pouring from the
top occasionally, and one central flow of molten

03:05:39.724 --> 03:05:44.960
rock tends to fill half of the cavern, like a
small river heading down into the base of the

03:05:44.960 --> 03:05:48.434
mountain. This is very familiar to you, as it's
the path that your dream took you.

03:05:48.434 --> 03:05:50.100
ASHLEY: Guys, this is really familiar to me.

03:05:50.100 --> 03:05:51.769
(all laugh)

03:05:51.769 --> 03:05:54.219
LAURA: We spent a whole game doing--

03:05:54.219 --> 03:05:56.150
MARISHA: Well, we took a wrong turn, I guess.

03:05:56.150 --> 03:05:58.086
LIAM: I don't know. We were flexing our muscles a
little bit.

03:05:58.086 --> 03:05:59.089
LAURA: Flexing our muscles.

03:05:59.089 --> 03:06:00.192
MARISHA: Yeah, I like it.

03:06:00.192 --> 03:06:01.608
LAURA: Plus you got us new armor out of it.

03:06:01.608 --> 03:06:02.878
TRAVIS: And I got naked, too.

03:06:02.878 --> 03:06:08.338
MATT: As you guys begin to step into the next
lengths of your subterranean journey, we'll pick

03:06:08.338 --> 03:06:12.675
that up next week. Thank you all so much for
tuning into Critical Role.

03:06:12.675 --> 03:06:14.443
LAURA: Man, oh man, oh man.

03:06:14.443 --> 03:06:17.840
MATT: Some tense battles. An intense encounter
choice on you guys' part. Well done on that.

03:06:17.840 --> 03:06:19.276
ASHLEY: I want to keep going.

03:06:19.276 --> 03:06:20.780
LIAM: Who's this guy?

03:06:20.780 --> 03:06:21.972
MATT: What is this?

03:06:21.972 --> 03:06:27.294
ZAC: All right, so. Amy was the winner of our
first giveaway.

03:06:27.294 --> 03:06:28.394
MATT: Congrats, Amy.

03:06:28.394 --> 03:06:29.690
(all cheer)

03:06:29.690 --> 03:06:31.509
MARISHA: Huzzah.

03:06:31.509 --> 03:06:36.650
ZAC: I ask whoever hasn't signed this, we're going
to pass it around to all sign it for Amy.

03:06:36.854 --> 03:06:37.850
MATT: Awesome, we'll all do that.

03:06:37.850 --> 03:06:40.104
ZAC: As a thank-you for Amy, she's an avid fan.

03:06:40.104 --> 03:06:41.141
LAURA: Yay!

03:06:41.141 --> 03:06:42.315
MATT: Thank you, Amy, that's awesome.

03:06:42.315 --> 03:06:43.258
MARISHA: Thanks for being a fan.

03:06:43.258 --> 03:06:44.159
ASHLEY: Thanks, Amy.

03:06:44.159 --> 03:06:48.562
ZAC: As a personal challenge, guys, from me to
you, I think we are, what are we, 18 away, Lucas?

03:06:48.562 --> 03:06:50.238
LUCAS: 19.

03:06:50.238 --> 03:06:53.167
LAURA: 19?

03:06:53.167 --> 03:06:54.536
MATT: 19 away from our next package?

03:06:54.536 --> 03:06:55.675
ZAC: From the next one.

03:06:55.675 --> 03:06:57.036
LUCAS: Is it at 1,550?

03:06:57.036 --> 03:06:57.878
ZAC: Yeah.

03:06:57.878 --> 03:06:59.802
LUCAS: Oh, we're 29 away.

03:06:59.802 --> 03:07:00.615
LAURA: Oh, okay.

03:07:00.615 --> 03:07:01.501
MATT: Aw.

03:07:01.501 --> 03:07:02.260
ZAC: Are you sure?

03:07:02.260 --> 03:07:03.351
LUCAS: Yeah, we're at 1,521.

03:07:03.351 --> 03:07:07.754
ZAC: Okay, so we've got a little bit of a ways to
go, but I'm going to go ahead and have these guys

03:07:07.754 --> 03:07:13.428
sign this one as well, and I'm going to push you
guys that by the end of tonight, if we reach

03:07:13.428 --> 03:07:18.164
1,550, I'll go ahead and throw this in with the
next promo kit, as well. And if not I'll hang onto

03:07:18.164 --> 03:07:20.037
it for myself, and I won.

03:07:20.037 --> 03:07:21.502
MATT: Boom.

03:07:21.502 --> 03:07:27.503
ZAC: Thank you guys so much. That was fun. It gets
more intense like every week.

03:07:27.503 --> 03:07:30.898
MATT: That's apparently the path this is taking,
so--

03:07:30.898 --> 03:07:32.554
MARISHA: We keep getting knocked unconscious.

03:07:32.554 --> 03:07:34.189
TRAVIS: We make amazing decisions.

03:07:34.189 --> 03:07:36.032
(all laugh)

03:07:36.105 --> 03:07:38.135
ZAC: And just so you guys know, that was the chat
room that decided on your fate.

03:07:38.135 --> 03:07:38.980
LAURA: You?

03:07:38.980 --> 03:07:39.946
TRAVIS: Sons of bitches.

03:07:39.946 --> 03:07:41.784
MATT: Yeah, second week in a row.

03:07:41.784 --> 03:07:44.922
TRAVIS: (sings) Why can't we be friends?

03:07:44.922 --> 03:07:48.828
ALL: (sing) Why can't we be friends?

03:07:48.828 --> 03:07:52.991
MATT: So the chat room creature choice, those will
be an occasional thing, not a weekly thing, 'cause

03:07:52.991 --> 03:07:56.745
it's too difficult to keep up with that and a
little too random. Plus that's just too many

03:07:56.745 --> 03:08:00.371
creatures to be prepared for. But every few weeks
or so, I'm gonna throw one out there for you guys.

03:08:00.371 --> 03:08:04.751
So come and watch. Hopefully you'll be there for
one of those episodes. Put your friends together,

03:08:04.751 --> 03:08:09.667
vote for the creature you want to see them fight,
and if a TPK happens, not my fault,

03:08:09.667 --> 03:08:11.209
it's totally on you guys.

03:08:11.209 --> 03:08:14.601
LAURA: Is that a total party kill?

03:08:14.601 --> 03:08:15.530
MATT: Total party kill.

03:08:15.530 --> 03:08:18.737
ZAC: That's intense.

03:08:18.810 --> 03:08:23.231
So, guys, we're not going to go offline
just now. We're going to stick around for a little

03:08:23.504 --> 03:08:27.396
while. We're going to throw it up while
we move some cameras, so I'm going to leave it up

03:08:27.396 --> 03:08:30.995
to the chat room. It's up to you guys, we can
either come back and play some Bloodborne on the

03:08:31.067 --> 03:08:36.139
PS4 that you guys bought us, or we can come back
and play some Just Dance 2014 that you guys also

03:08:36.139 --> 03:08:39.996
bought us. So there's dancing or Bloodborne. It's
up to you guys.

03:08:39.996 --> 03:08:43.262
MATT: Dancing is fun to watch, Bloodborne just to
watch him get really, really angry.

03:08:43.262 --> 03:08:45.642
ZAC: I don't get angry. Lucas gets angry, though.

03:08:45.642 --> 03:08:51.391
MATT: This game, the beginning of this game will
make you angry. All right, all right.

03:08:51.463 --> 03:08:56.244
MARISHA: You don't get angry? Have you played Dark
Souls or Demon Souls? Because--

03:08:56.244 --> 03:08:57.483
ZAC: I think actually--

03:08:57.483 --> 03:09:01.674
MATT: Demon Souls mimics, man, I know the pain
you're in for.

03:09:01.674 --> 03:09:04.682
ZAC: What was it like, Bachee or something like
that? Man, that game pissed me off.

03:09:04.682 --> 03:09:05.677
ORION: Bocce ball?

03:09:05.677 --> 03:09:07.944
ZAC: Wings of-- ire, ear, something like that.

03:09:07.944 --> 03:09:09.029
MATT: Oh yeah, I know what you're talking about.

03:09:09.029 --> 03:09:13.466
ZAC: Man, that was heavy. Would any of you guys be
interested in sticking around to dance a round or

03:09:13.466 --> 03:09:20.292
two if we were to go to Just Dance? It's a nightly
staple here. We end the nights with dancing. I

03:09:20.292 --> 03:09:22.706
don't know if you guys have seen that
ridiculousness, but--

03:09:22.706 --> 03:09:24.303
MATT: Who would want to stick around for that?

03:09:24.303 --> 03:09:26.788
ZAC: They're all shivering in fear, you guys

03:09:26.788 --> 03:09:30.518
LIAM: How soon will that start? I'll stay for 20.

03:09:30.518 --> 03:09:31.879
MATT: We can stay for a little bit.

03:09:31.879 --> 03:09:36.054
ZAC: I bet they're are all going to ask for
dancing now.

03:09:36.127 --> 03:09:37.947
LUCAS: See a lot of Bloodborne, actually.

03:09:38.018 --> 03:09:39.336
ZAC: Oh, really?

03:09:39.336 --> 03:09:40.762
MATT: Oh, I live for Bloodborne, man.

03:09:40.762 --> 03:09:41.172
ZAC: Well, the second--
