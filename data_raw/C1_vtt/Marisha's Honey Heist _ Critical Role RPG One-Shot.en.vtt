MARISHA: Hi, everyone, and welcome to tonight's
episode of Critical Role! Trinket's Honey Heist!

00:00:07.133 --> 00:00:17.821
Oh my god. I would like to start off by saying
that this is terrifying. And that's it! So, let's

00:00:17.821 --> 00:00:24.383
get to our announcements really fast. I believe we
have a sponsor, right, Sam Riegel?

00:00:24.383 --> 00:00:28.688
SAM: We do have a sponsor tonight. Our sponsor
tonight is Marvel Puzzle Quest, friends of the

00:00:28.688 --> 00:00:33.988
show. Now, here's the thing. I was so excited
about the Honey Heist and having Marisha Ray as

00:00:33.988 --> 00:00:40.703
our DM, I forgot to write an ad for Marvel Puzzle
Quest. Don't worry, though. We're in good hands. I

00:00:40.703 --> 00:00:46.904
prepared for such an event. A long time ago, I
recorded a generic ad, so we'll just play that in

00:00:46.904 --> 00:00:51.493
its stead, because I didn't write anything
original. So guys, go ahead and roll that generic

00:00:51.493 --> 00:01:00.498
ad. Here it comes. Little delay. It's going
great.

00:01:00.498 --> 00:01:02.323
OFF-SCREEN VOICE #1: Hey big bro, what you doing?

00:01:02.323 --> 00:01:04.528
OFF-SCREEN VOICE #2: You're such a dweeb, little
bro. You haven't heard of--

00:01:04.528 --> 00:01:06.018
SAM: Marvel Puzzle Quest!

00:01:06.018 --> 00:01:08.245
#1: Sounds awesome, but wait. What's--

00:01:08.245 --> 00:01:09.519
SAM: Marvel Puzzle Quest!

00:01:09.519 --> 00:01:11.106
#2: Dude, it's the best--

00:01:11.106 --> 00:01:12.307
SAM: Video game!

00:01:12.307 --> 00:01:13.635
#2: --I've ever--

00:01:13.635 --> 00:01:14.617
SAM: Played!

00:01:14.617 --> 00:01:17.208
#2: --It's so killer-diller, because it's got--

00:01:17.208 --> 00:01:21.104
SAM: Features some of your Marvel teams, like
X-Men, Avengers, and Guardians of the Galaxy!

00:01:21.104 --> 00:01:22.289
#1: No way!

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:24.221
#2: Way! And also--

00:01:24.221 --> 00:01:27.376
SAM: You can recruit Thor, from Thor: Ragnarok,
and Nightcrawler!

00:01:27.376 --> 00:01:29.890
#2: --which is way radical!

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.686
#1: Sounds tubular! Can I try your--

00:01:32.686 --> 00:01:34.556
SAM: Marvel Puzzle Quest!

00:01:34.556 --> 00:01:37.840
#2: Whoa, whoa, I don't let doofuses touch my--

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:39.284
SAM: Marvel Puzzle Quest!

00:01:39.284 --> 00:01:41.069
#2: --get your own!

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:43.718
#1: Me? But how? I'm not made of money!

00:01:43.718 --> 00:01:47.612
#2: You don't need to be, you dingus! You can
get--

00:01:47.612 --> 00:01:49.278
SAM: Marvel Puzzle Quest!

00:01:49.278 --> 00:01:50.674
#2: --for the low price of--

00:01:50.674 --> 00:01:51.850
SAM: It's free.

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:54.500
#1: Hold up! It only costs--

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:55.702
SAM: It's free.

00:01:55.702 --> 00:01:58.590
#2: That's right, nerd-face! The price is--

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:59.777
SAM: It's free.

00:01:59.777 --> 00:02:01.126
#1: Whoa! That's so--

00:02:01.126 --> 00:02:02.256
SAM: Affordable.

00:02:02.256 --> 00:02:04.017
#2: I know! So get some--

00:02:04.017 --> 00:02:05.296
SAM: Marvel Puzzle Quest!

00:02:05.296 --> 00:02:07.221
#2: --for yourself at your local--

00:02:07.221 --> 00:02:10.071
SAM: Apple Store, Google Play, Amazon App Store,
and Steam!

00:02:10.071 --> 00:02:12.893
#1: Oh, you know I will, big bro!

00:02:12.893 --> 00:02:14.467
#2: Righteous, little bro!

00:02:14.467 --> 00:02:15.816
#1: Sweet!

00:02:15.816 --> 00:02:16.812
#2: Boo-yah!

00:02:16.812 --> 00:02:17.618
#1: Dope!

00:02:17.618 --> 00:02:18.607
#2: Ch'yeah!

00:02:18.607 --> 00:02:19.922
#1: Whoomp, there it is!

00:02:19.922 --> 00:02:20.875
#2: Fucken!

00:02:20.875 --> 00:02:21.635
#1: Phat!

00:02:21.635 --> 00:02:22.585
#2: Gettin' jiggy!

00:02:22.585 --> 00:02:25.425
SAM: This goes on for a while. Let's cut it
there!

00:02:25.425 --> 00:02:26.610
#2: Talk to the hand!

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:27.675
#1: Ch'yeah!

00:02:27.675 --> 00:02:28.459
#2: Yeah!

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:29.402
#1: Ch'yeah!

00:02:29.402 --> 00:02:33.698
SAM: Sorry about that. It's a long one, guys.

00:02:33.698 --> 00:02:37.283
TALIESIN: You were so prepared. I don't feel well
anymore.

00:02:37.283 --> 00:02:42.218
BRIAN: I hope that the audio of that stuff didn't
end up on the stream, and they just saw you going,

00:02:42.218 --> 00:02:44.195
"Marvel Puzzle Quest!"

00:02:44.195 --> 00:02:48.511
SAM: That would be amazing. Sorry it took so long,
Marisha.

00:02:48.511 --> 00:02:58.359
MARISHA: No, anything to delay my impending doom.
Okay. Merch! Laura knows what's up, isn't that

00:02:58.359 --> 00:03:00.247
right--? Oh, Matt, you want to do merch?

00:03:00.247 --> 00:03:04.818
MATT: Hi! I mean, the big news is that today,
available, we have the art book!

00:03:04.818 --> 00:03:09.166
SAM: Oh my god!

00:03:09.166 --> 00:03:10.722
LIAM: It's so beautiful.

00:03:10.722 --> 00:03:12.112
TALIESIN: It's full of stars.

00:03:12.112 --> 00:03:15.660
LIAM: Oh hi, Sam, have you seen our art book?

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:16.998
SAM: No, I haven't!

00:03:16.998 --> 00:03:18.081
LIAM: I can't open it now.

00:03:18.081 --> 00:03:19.353
TALIESIN: We cannot open the art book.

00:03:19.353 --> 00:03:20.584
SAM: You still can't even open it, now?

00:03:20.584 --> 00:03:23.641
LIAM: We're not going to show the audience the
insides! Oh my god!

00:03:23.641 --> 00:03:26.157
MATT: Show them one page?

00:03:26.157 --> 00:03:32.613
LIAM: One page? I don't know. We'd have to have
clearance or something, isn't that how it works?

00:03:32.613 --> 00:03:36.846
MATT: I will provide clearance &lt;i&gt;right now&lt;/i&gt;. For
one page! It's on sale today, come on!

00:03:36.846 --> 00:03:38.817
LIAM: Okay, okay.

00:03:38.817 --> 00:03:41.550
BRIAN: They can sue Matt Mercer.

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:50.007
LIAM: I guess, I guess. Shit, man. Let's do this
Percy page, this bomb-ass double Percy spread. Ooh!

00:03:50.007 --> 00:03:52.112
(yelling)

00:03:52.112 --> 00:03:53.343
MARISHA: Pretty bomb-ass!

00:03:53.343 --> 00:03:54.886
LIAM: Look at this gorgeousness!

00:03:54.886 --> 00:03:58.039
SAM: Security's coming down, they're going to shut
us down. Close it, close the book!

00:03:58.039 --> 00:04:00.255
LIAM: Sorry, Rachel.

00:04:00.255 --> 00:04:04.864
MATT: I'll take the heat for it. Yeah, so that's
up.

00:04:04.864 --> 00:04:11.315
TALIESIN: These are now available for order.
They're beautiful and amazing and fabulous.

00:04:11.315 --> 00:04:16.005
MATT: I heard there was a bit of an issue earlier
today? A kerfuffle with international shipping?

00:04:16.005 --> 00:04:17.934
But that has since been fixed.

00:04:17.934 --> 00:04:22.586
TALIESIN: Yeah, we have more or less evened that
out now, so there's currently a standard rate, I

00:04:22.586 --> 00:04:24.047
believe, for international shipping.

00:04:24.047 --> 00:04:29.498
MATT: And for people who've already paid, I
believe we're getting that fixed. Most today, and

00:04:29.498 --> 00:04:30.517
some tomorrow.

00:04:30.517 --> 00:04:31.769
TALIESIN: Yeah, there's a few that are a little
tricky.

00:04:31.769 --> 00:04:33.585
MARISHA: Why does it get so weird about books?

00:04:33.585 --> 00:04:38.165
TALIESIN: It's weird. They were showing me charts
and graphs to explain what happened this morning,

00:04:38.165 --> 00:04:41.768
and it was all very complicated, but it basically
boiled down to our standard Benny Hill

00:04:41.768 --> 00:04:43.088
ridiculousness.

00:04:43.088 --> 00:04:45.625
MARISHA and TALIESIN: (singing Yakety Sax)

00:04:45.625 --> 00:04:47.777
BRIAN: We have this shirt.

00:04:47.777 --> 00:04:53.938
SAM: Oh yeah! That's Matt Mercer with white
sunglasses!

00:04:53.938 --> 00:04:55.353
MATT: No flesh!

00:04:55.353 --> 00:04:57.659
TALIESIN: An absence of Matt Mercer.

00:04:57.659 --> 00:05:01.621
BRIAN: The coolest Kanye West sunglasses on you've
ever seen.

00:05:01.621 --> 00:05:03.780
MATT: They're a little broken, but they work fine
for the image.

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:08.578
TALIESIN: We also have the scarves, although none
of us have the scarves on right now.

00:05:08.578 --> 00:05:10.523
BRIAN: You will see the scarves during the break.

00:05:10.523 --> 00:05:13.401
TALIESIN: And many other things.

00:05:13.401 --> 00:05:15.695
LIAM: Yeah, go to the shop. There's lots of shit.

00:05:15.695 --> 00:05:21.176
BRIAN: The d20s are in. The new Vox Machina d20s
are in the shop.

00:05:21.176 --> 00:05:24.773
SAM: Don't forget to watch Brian's stupid show,
every Tuesday night.

00:05:24.773 --> 00:05:27.393
BRIAN: Don't forget to watch Brian's stupid 
show before it gets canceled.

00:05:27.393 --> 00:05:36.993
MARISHA: Yeah. Oh, we have a weird announcement
that came up pretty fast, as of yesterday. We are

00:05:36.993 --> 00:05:37.997
married.

00:05:37.997 --> 00:05:39.548
MATT: We did get married. That's a thing.

00:05:39.548 --> 00:05:43.213
MARISHA: That didn't happen that fast, though.
That was very long. That was a lot, but we're

00:05:43.213 --> 00:05:45.942
married now.

00:05:45.942 --> 00:05:48.258
(Sam clinking his mug)

00:05:48.258 --> 00:05:50.118
MATT: No, I cannot--

00:05:50.118 --> 00:05:53.960
TALIESIN: That's a deep cut inside joke, right
there.

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:58.707
MARISHA: Force Grey is coming up.

00:05:58.707 --> 00:06:07.259
MATT: Yes, not this Saturday, but the Saturday
after that. November 18th, I think? Yes. We're

00:06:07.259 --> 00:06:12.760
doing the Force Grey finale for season two in New
York. Tickets are available. You can go to the

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:17.345
official Dungeons &amp; Dragons Twitter, or my
Twitter, for information. With fantastic guests

00:06:17.345 --> 00:06:23.431
like Deborah Ann Woll, Joe Manganiello, which
you've seen here on the show, Dylan and Utkarsh

00:06:23.431 --> 00:06:27.522
are going to be back from the series, and we have
our fifth player to announce!

00:06:27.522 --> 00:06:31.217
MARISHA: I'm jumping in as of yesterday! Yeah!

00:06:31.217 --> 00:06:33.396
BRIAN: I didn't think they had that kind of
budget!

00:06:33.396 --> 00:06:41.379
MARISHA: We need one more person! We're down a
player! So I am playing a tortle named Clarapin

00:06:41.379 --> 00:06:48.843
the therrapin. Pretty stoked. Or maybe it's
terrapin, I don't know. It's still new. I'm still

00:06:48.843 --> 00:06:55.140
working it out in my head. But I think we have a
picture of Clarapin. There's no vetting monitor,

00:06:55.140 --> 00:07:02.505
nothing, over there. Ooh! Aah! That's good old
Clarapin! She's a bard!

00:07:02.505 --> 00:07:04.696
LIAM: They just ran a picture of Squirtle.

00:07:04.696 --> 00:07:10.666
MARISHA: Yeah, they totally could have. Teenage
Mutant Ninja-- And moving on from that, the

00:07:10.666 --> 00:07:22.441
Critical Role podcast is up to episode 70. You can
get it on Amazon Echo, Echo Dot, Echo Plus, as

00:07:22.441 --> 00:07:28.365
well as Alexa-enabled devices, as well as other--
I should've read the top of that, "Is now

00:07:28.365 --> 00:07:39.191
"available through Amazon Alexa." That was the top
part of that. Vox Machina: Origins is still out.

00:07:39.191 --> 00:07:41.749
LIAM: We're coming up on another issue pretty
soon.

00:07:41.749 --> 00:07:44.139
MATT: Next few weeks, issue three is going to be
out.

00:07:44.139 --> 00:07:47.669
TALIESIN: But hey, there's a comic book. We're in
it. That's a thing.

00:07:47.669 --> 00:07:50.177
MARISHA: We have our big Critical Role wrap-up on
the 14th.

00:07:50.177 --> 00:07:56.254
BRIAN: Yes, that is going to air on the 14th,
which is a Thursday night, at 7:00, in this very

00:07:56.254 --> 00:08:07.211
timeslot, on these very networks. Both Twitch and
Project Alpha. We will be breaking up the Vox

00:08:07.211 --> 00:08:13.737
Machina journey into five sections. So we
announced on Tuesday night that the first posts

00:08:13.737 --> 00:08:20.083
are up if you want to submit questions for
episodes one through, I believe it's 23. In the

00:08:20.083 --> 00:08:25.037
wrap-up episode, we're going to discuss all kinds
of stuff. We're going to let you guys ask Matt all

00:08:25.037 --> 00:08:29.936
kinds of things. You guys are going to get to ask
each other. We're going to squeeze as many secrets

00:08:29.936 --> 00:08:35.073
out of this delicious man's body as we can, by any
means necessary. I have ordered many medieval

00:08:35.073 --> 00:08:38.794
torture devices. Gummy bears. All kinds of good
stuff.

00:08:38.794 --> 00:08:43.291
SAM: Oh my god, she left. Couldn't take the heat.

00:08:43.291 --> 00:08:46.380
LIAM: Hole in the studio floor. She went down it.

00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:54.621
BRIAN: So yeah, submit questions on the Reddit or
at the Talks Machina Twitter account, or Facebook

00:08:54.621 --> 00:08:56.202
page, or the Alpha forums.

00:08:56.202 --> 00:09:02.207
MARISHA: Correct. And then, of course, me,
Taliesin, Matt, and Liam are going to be at PAX

00:09:02.207 --> 00:09:08.006
Unplugged next Friday. Wednesday Club, still a
thing.

00:09:08.006 --> 00:09:11.120
TALIESIN: Still a thing. We haven't actually
decided what we're doing next week yet, because it

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:16.489
all depends on who's going to be joining us. We
have a couple invites out to people, so we're

00:09:16.489 --> 00:09:19.038
waiting to hear. It'll be fun no matter what.

00:09:19.038 --> 00:09:20.492
BRIAN: When's the Moon Knight episode?

00:09:20.492 --> 00:09:25.298
TALIESIN: Never. Yeah, no, we'll do a Moon Knight.
You want to do a Moon Knight episode?

00:09:25.298 --> 00:09:27.200
BRIAN: I would come on for a Moon Knight episode.

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:28.713
TALIESIN: I'll talk about Moon Knight. I love Moon
Knight.

00:09:28.713 --> 00:09:30.281
LIAM: What about Spider Ham?

00:09:30.281 --> 00:09:33.614
TALIESIN: Oh, Peter Porker? The Spectacular
Spider-Ham? We can do a full animals episode. That

00:09:33.614 --> 00:09:34.849
would be a lot of fun.

00:09:34.849 --> 00:09:41.681
MARISHA: That would be great. You sang in a
Blizzard promo for a new expansion.

00:09:41.681 --> 00:09:47.616
MATT: An upcoming Hearthstone expansion. Kobolds
and Catacombs, which references another cool game

00:09:47.616 --> 00:09:48.956
that sometimes people play.

00:09:48.956 --> 00:09:52.295
MARISHA: Not today, though.

00:09:52.295 --> 00:09:56.707
MATT: No, yeah, of course. But yeah, they had me
sing the announcement trailer, which you can check

00:09:56.707 --> 00:10:04.364
out online and poke fun at me being a silly
voice-in-the-void minstrel bard about making your

00:10:04.364 --> 00:10:07.264
way through catacombs filled with kobolds. So
check it out.

00:10:07.264 --> 00:10:12.437
TALIESIN: Your response via text when we texted
you that that was happening was adorable. "Oh,

00:10:12.437 --> 00:10:14.767
"that's what that was. I suppose that's happening
now."

00:10:14.767 --> 00:10:17.782
MATT: Yeah, I didn't know they were announcing it
at BlizzCon. It was just like, oh, on the opening

00:10:17.782 --> 00:10:19.604
ceremonies screen.

00:10:19.604 --> 00:10:21.506
BRIAN: Were you in there when they did that?

00:10:21.506 --> 00:10:24.795
MATT: We were driving at the time. I was like,
"What is going--?! Oh."

00:10:24.795 --> 00:10:30.413
TALIESIN: Eric and I were at the Overwatch arena.
We were sitting, listening, and we both started

00:10:30.413 --> 00:10:32.150
squealing really loudly.

00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:36.534
BRIAN: Yeah, that looked really fun. I saw they
brought in Darin De Paul on a big throne that they

00:10:36.534 --> 00:10:37.874
were all carrying.

00:10:37.874 --> 00:10:39.751
MARISHA: He is the mayor of BlizzCon.

00:10:39.751 --> 00:10:42.887
MATT: Blizzard can afford it.

00:10:42.887 --> 00:10:51.528
MARISHA: I think that's pretty much it. Last but
not least, I would love to thank Joana, a.k.a.

00:10:51.528 --> 00:10:59.551
@_sleepyjane, for doing the wonderful bear art.
And then I would like to give a huge shout-out to

00:10:59.551 --> 00:11:07.445
Grant Howitt, who is the writer and the producer
of Honey Heist, as well as several other silly RPG

00:11:07.445 --> 00:11:12.277
one-shot games. You can get this for free. That's
the amazing thing about this. He publishes all of

00:11:12.277 --> 00:11:19.039
his games for free. You can support him, which we
highly recommend you do, at patreon.com/gshowitt.

00:11:19.039 --> 00:11:21.516
MATT: H-O-W-I-T-T.

00:11:21.516 --> 00:11:28.184
MARISHA: Yeah, and if you can join his Patreon,
you get some cool stuff that you might see. So

00:11:28.184 --> 00:11:33.966
yeah. Anyway. I think, oh my god.

00:11:33.966 --> 00:11:36.834
TALIESIN: I know, it's weird! It feels weird,
doesn't it?

00:11:36.834 --> 00:11:38.280
BRIAN: Say it!

00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:40.233
MARISHA: What do you say? Like, "Without further
ado"?

00:11:40.233 --> 00:11:42.459
MATT: I don't know, you've only seen it every week
for the past two and a half years!

00:11:42.459 --> 00:11:52.150
MARISHA: Without further ado, let us now jump into
this Trinket's Honey Heist version of Critical Role!

00:11:52.150 --> 00:13:24.766
[dramatic music]

00:13:24.766 --> 00:13:26.449
MARISHA: Welcome back.

00:13:26.449 --> 00:13:28.154
SAM: Serious, serious.

00:13:28.154 --> 00:13:29.858
LIAM: We're bears.

00:13:29.858 --> 00:13:34.619
MARISHA: Where we last left off, didn't happen. So
we'll jump right in.

00:13:34.619 --> 00:13:40.331
MATT: Any rules to go over?

00:13:40.331 --> 00:13:42.422
MARISHA: Oh! Should I go over rules now?

00:13:42.422 --> 00:13:43.835
MATT: I figured, that way we can go right into the
narrative.

00:13:43.835 --> 00:13:45.842
MARISHA: Yeah, where we last left off was rules--

00:13:45.842 --> 00:13:47.553
SAM: Stop backseat DMing!

00:13:47.553 --> 00:13:49.535
MATT: I'm trying to help! It's her first time--
I'll shut up.

00:13:49.535 --> 00:13:57.417
MARISHA: Before we jump in, Honey Heist is a super
simple game. Everyone is a bear. The bear has a

00:13:57.417 --> 00:14:04.094
special skill. We'll see that as we go along. You
will eventually be getting roles. You're trying to

00:14:04.094 --> 00:14:15.858
heist the mother lode of honey heists. So you have
two stats: your bear stat and your criminal stat.

00:14:15.858 --> 00:14:21.904
You start the game with three points in each of
the stats. This is a d6-based game, so whenever

00:14:21.904 --> 00:14:25.959
you do anything remotely bear-related, you're
going to roll your bear stat. You want to try and

00:14:25.959 --> 00:14:33.895
get the number equal to or under how many points
you have in bear. Criminal is anything, basically,

00:14:33.895 --> 00:14:39.642
not related to being a bear. That's quite
literally, actually, what it says, "Not to do

00:14:39.642 --> 00:14:46.371
"anything directly related to being a bear." Same
thing. Equal to or under. Right? If the plan's

00:14:46.371 --> 00:14:52.693
going well, I can reward you with a point in
criminal. You move a point from bear over to the

00:14:52.693 --> 00:14:59.485
stat. Conversely, if you start getting a little
aggravated, or the plan starts not working out in

00:14:59.485 --> 00:15:05.185
your favor, you might move a point from criminal
into bear, the more frustrated you get. If you

00:15:05.185 --> 00:15:11.483
reach six points in either stat, you either turn
into an insane criminal mastermind, betray the

00:15:11.483 --> 00:15:18.413
party, and decide to bounce, or you go completely
feral as a bear and can't really function being a

00:15:18.413 --> 00:15:22.402
criminal anymore, and you're out. So you don't
want that to happen.

00:15:22.402 --> 00:15:27.814
SAM: Is there any other way to die? Like, if you
fall off something, do you die? What happens?

00:15:27.814 --> 00:15:31.217
MARISHA: Just don't jump off any cliffs is my
recommendation.

00:15:31.217 --> 00:15:35.430
MATT: You get more frustrated from jumping off
a cliff. You become more bear-like. Cliffs can't

00:15:35.430 --> 00:15:36.381
kill bears.

00:15:36.381 --> 00:15:41.802
MARISHA: No. It's very cartoonish. Cartoon
physics. Just don't look down if you decide to

00:15:41.802 --> 00:15:43.220
walk off a cliff.

00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:45.659
BRIAN: Do forest fires kill bears?

00:15:45.659 --> 00:15:49.327
MATT: No, they don't. That's why he has to keep
telling us to fight them.

00:15:49.327 --> 00:15:57.163
MARISHA: If you feel like you're starting to get a
little too bear-y, you can flash back to a

00:15:57.163 --> 00:16:03.605
criminal planning sequence in order to move a
point from bear into criminal. If you're feeling a

00:16:03.605 --> 00:16:12.256
little too shady, you can eat a nice little snack
of honey to move a point from criminal back into bear.

00:16:12.256 --> 00:16:15.259
LIAM: Do we have a Batman belt with honey stashed
on it?

00:16:15.259 --> 00:16:16.371
MATT: Nope.

00:16:16.371 --> 00:16:18.585
LIAM: We have to find it and eat it? Yeah.

00:16:18.585 --> 00:16:24.657
MARISHA: That's what you guys are good at. All
right, I think we get started.

00:16:24.657 --> 00:16:31.185
SAM: (bear roar) Ease into it.

00:16:31.185 --> 00:16:36.390
MARISHA: No wookiees. Hereby ban on wookiees.

00:16:36.390 --> 00:16:38.148
BRIAN: Oh, I should go.

00:16:38.148 --> 00:16:40.815
MATT: Well no, it's my plan to die in the first
half of the show.

00:16:40.815 --> 00:16:52.921
MARISHA: This isn't the zombie apocalypse. All
right. It's autumn, two years after the defeat of

00:16:52.921 --> 00:16:55.281
the Chroma Conclave, in Westruun.

00:16:55.281 --> 00:16:56.606
SAM: Wait, we're in Westruun?

00:16:56.606 --> 00:16:58.164
MARISHA: We're in Westruun.

00:16:58.164 --> 00:16:59.575
LIAM: Those fucking assholes.

00:16:59.575 --> 00:17:05.165
MARISHA: The air has that perfect, crisp breeze
indicative of the chillier months to come. The

00:17:05.165 --> 00:17:11.937
scent of deep-fried festival foods and fermented
alcohols radiates heavily from the center of the

00:17:11.937 --> 00:17:17.842
town square in the Opal and Market Wards. The
distant sound of string quartets and laughing

00:17:17.842 --> 00:17:27.455
townsfolk pick up in your ear. Trinket, the
immense sense recall spawns the memory in your

00:17:27.455 --> 00:17:39.627
head, and you know: this is the Happy Food
Festival time. This is your favorite time. But for

00:17:39.627 --> 00:17:47.788
some reason, Vex is walking you away from the
festival, and toward the Bramblewood Forest! "I

00:17:47.788 --> 00:17:55.528
"know, buddy, but listen, I need you to stay here.
Look, I can't have you risking sneaking away and

00:17:55.528 --> 00:17:57.257
"giving in to your temptations again."

00:17:57.257 --> 00:17:59.374
MATT: (sad bear growl)

00:17:59.374 --> 00:18:03.595
MARISHA: "Pike would kill me, and she's already
upset at you for clearing out the Slayer's Cake

00:18:03.595 --> 00:18:14.652
"honey stash the past two times. I know. But look,
I promise you, if you do this for me, buddy, I'll

00:18:14.652 --> 00:18:24.120
"come back with a whole load of festival treats!
All right? All right, darling? Okay. Be good.

00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:33.101
"Don't get into any trouble. Okay? Happy bear." And
she walks on down the road.

00:18:33.101 --> 00:18:34.900
MATT: Where am I at, right now?

00:18:34.900 --> 00:18:41.183
MARISHA: You are currently on the edge of the
Bramblewood Forest, up on a mountain. You can kind

00:18:41.183 --> 00:18:43.079
of see Westruun in the distance.

00:18:43.079 --> 00:18:45.840
MATT: So looking down at the city from a distance?
Okay.

00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:52.269
MARISHA: You can see far off that the city is
dressed up in autumn colors and reds, and there

00:18:52.269 --> 00:19:00.143
are wagons being pulled into the city. You
recalled Vex mentioning something about the

00:19:00.143 --> 00:19:06.866
Slayer's Cake competing in a competition. Seems
like they've got a lot of competitions. They are

00:19:06.866 --> 00:19:17.195
entering Keyleth and Pike's prize honey. Mm-hmm.
So you know there's a lot of honey. As you turn

00:19:17.195 --> 00:19:26.013
around, you hear a few cracks of branches. There's
a crowd of other bears. Seem to have been watching

00:19:26.013 --> 00:19:31.898
the whole time. There's a panda that waves.

00:19:31.898 --> 00:19:34.712
SAM: Can we speak English?

00:19:34.712 --> 00:19:43.729
MARISHA: Yeah, you can speak to each other. You
can kind of mumble through words to humans. Yeah,

00:19:43.729 --> 00:19:46.814
you can, kind of.

00:19:46.814 --> 00:19:49.095
MATT: Hey, you.

00:19:49.095 --> 00:19:50.534
SAM: Yeah?

00:19:50.534 --> 00:19:52.105
MATT: What's your name?

00:19:52.105 --> 00:19:59.721
SAM: Oh, me? I'm Peddy Tuxpin. I'm new to these
parts. I come from, you know, somewhere else. But

00:19:59.721 --> 00:20:04.263
I've been walking around. Checking it out. I like the
place.

00:20:04.263 --> 00:20:06.345
MATT: All right, you seem a little fish out of
water.

00:20:06.345 --> 00:20:07.917
SAM: What's your name?

00:20:07.917 --> 00:20:10.604
MATT: They call me Trinket.

00:20:10.604 --> 00:20:12.069
SAM: You a girl?

00:20:12.069 --> 00:20:19.940
MATT: I am a member of Vox Machina, saviors of
this land, Tal'Dorei, and beyond. You show me some

00:20:19.940 --> 00:20:21.220
respect.

00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:25.479
SAM: I look at his junk. Hey, he's not a girl.

00:20:25.479 --> 00:20:30.758
MATT: Who are you untrustworthy lot, too, to be
with this guy?

00:20:30.811 --> 00:20:40.323
LIAM: Hey, my name is Cookie. I am a bear. This is
my brother, Waffle.

00:20:40.323 --> 00:20:47.904
TALIESIN: How you doing? Yeah, we just rolled into
town, picked up this guy along the way. We don't

00:20:47.904 --> 00:20:53.966
speak for him, not going to give him any credit
right now. Seems like an okay guy.

00:20:53.966 --> 00:20:57.150
MATT: You guys are all hanging out here at the
edge of the Bramblewood for no reason?

00:20:57.150 --> 00:20:58.932
LIAM: Well, man, we heard this town's got the good
shit.

00:20:58.932 --> 00:21:12.578
MATT: You may have heard right. All right. Three
new bears. Three large-sized, normal bears.

00:21:12.578 --> 00:21:15.280
SAM: There's another guy. There's one more guy.

00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:18.224
MATT: I look around, and I only see the three
bears.

00:21:18.224 --> 00:21:19.982
SAM: There's one more.

00:21:19.982 --> 00:21:22.021
BRIAN: I'm a little smaller.

00:21:22.021 --> 00:21:25.209
MARISHA: He peeks out from behind Peddy Tuxpin.

00:21:25.209 --> 00:21:36.507
BRIAN: I'm not really a bear. I'm a honey badger.
My name is Liam Las Vegas. I'm on a bender. That's it.

00:21:36.507 --> 00:21:38.433
SAM: A honey bender?

00:21:38.433 --> 00:21:44.950
BRIAN: I'm on a honey bender. I'm here with you
lads, strictly for the honey.

00:21:44.950 --> 00:21:51.234
TALIESIN: Don't let his personality defects fool
you. He's a top man, knows his business.

00:21:51.234 --> 00:21:54.050
LIAM: I mean, he's a total asshole, but he's
really good at his work.

00:21:54.050 --> 00:21:56.187
TALIESIN: He's good at what he does, when he can
do it.

00:21:56.187 --> 00:21:59.024
BRIAN: Started out as a bottom man, now I'm a top
man.

00:21:59.024 --> 00:22:01.394
TALIESIN: Worked his way to the middle, mostly.

00:22:01.394 --> 00:22:02.958
BRIAN: Middle man.

00:22:02.958 --> 00:22:05.784
TALIESIN: Top of his field, as a middle man.

00:22:05.784 --> 00:22:07.462
BRIAN: Top of the middle.

00:22:07.462 --> 00:22:09.228
TALIESIN: Worked his way from the bottom.

00:22:09.228 --> 00:22:11.248
BRIAN: Started from the bottom, now we at the
middle man.

00:22:11.248 --> 00:22:13.105
TALIESIN: Top of it.

00:22:13.105 --> 00:22:21.136
MARISHA: As you hear the music in the background
press on, all you can keep thinking about,

00:22:21.136 --> 00:22:30.265
Trinket, is that massive stash of honey hiding
right behind the walls of the Hazel Festival.

00:22:30.265 --> 00:22:33.184
MATT: I look out. Do I still see Vex, or is she
far enough away?

00:22:33.184 --> 00:22:36.301
MARISHA: She's pretty far gone, at this point,
over the mountain. She doesn't seem to be paying

00:22:36.301 --> 00:22:37.697
any attention to you.

00:22:37.697 --> 00:22:39.676
TALIESIN: I'm going to try and sense honey.

00:22:39.676 --> 00:22:42.901
MARISHA: Okay, roll a bear.

00:22:42.901 --> 00:22:45.309
TALIESIN: Double die.

00:22:45.309 --> 00:22:46.711
MARISHA: You get advantage, yeah.

00:22:46.711 --> 00:22:51.421
TALIESIN: Nope. Wait, is this--? Nope.

00:22:51.421 --> 00:23:01.006
MARISHA: All right, right now, there's a lot of
fried foods. You know at ren faire, when that mead

00:23:01.006 --> 00:23:06.394
smell and dirt? Kind of like that. That's all
you've got right now. It's a little too much right now.

00:23:06.394 --> 00:23:09.850
LIAM: We probably want to get closer in before we
start using the, you know.

00:23:09.850 --> 00:23:13.282
TALIESIN: No no, the nose ain't picking nothing up
right now. No.

00:23:13.282 --> 00:23:15.432
MARISHA: You begin to make your plan.

00:23:15.432 --> 00:23:18.390
BRIAN: We should obviously get drinks.

00:23:18.390 --> 00:23:26.275
MATT: I was going to say, first and foremost, like
I said, my name's Trinket. I'm an adventurer. I've

00:23:26.275 --> 00:23:31.115
been through dungeons of all sorts and kinds. Used
to scaring things off that are dangerous, in my

00:23:31.115 --> 00:23:37.312
way. I have no idea what the hell you're all
capable of. You, panda bear.

00:23:37.312 --> 00:23:39.077
SAM: The name's Peddy.

00:23:39.077 --> 00:23:40.407
MATT: Peddy.

00:23:40.407 --> 00:23:42.043
SAM: Peddy Bear.

00:23:42.043 --> 00:23:47.706
(muffled laughter)

00:23:47.706 --> 00:23:52.894
MATT: Tell me. If we're going to go into this city
and we're going to reap the rewards of this honey

00:23:52.894 --> 00:23:58.554
festival contest, and I know where it is, what do
you have to bring to the table, anyway?

00:23:58.554 --> 00:24:04.043
MARISHA: Peddy, why don't you go ahead and roll a
d6? This will determine your role.

00:24:04.043 --> 00:24:06.508
SAM: One.

00:24:06.508 --> 00:24:11.863
MARISHA: Peddy. Peddy Tuxpin, you're the muscle of
the group.

00:24:11.863 --> 00:24:24.371
SAM: Let me lay out a day in the life of Peddy
Tuxpin for you. I wake up. I eat. Bamboo, mostly.

00:24:24.371 --> 00:24:30.590
About 10:00am, I eat. 12:00, I eat.

00:24:30.590 --> 00:24:32.518
BRIAN: What do you eat at 12:00?

00:24:32.518 --> 00:24:43.991
SAM: Bamboo. 1:00 through 4:00 is naptime. 4:00 to
bedtime is eating. Now, I lay this all out for you

00:24:43.991 --> 00:24:52.802
because I want you to know, what I do with those
calories is I crush skulls. I break bones. I rough

00:24:52.802 --> 00:25:00.236
up people who haven't made their payments. I,
well, we can arm wrestle if you really want a

00:25:00.236 --> 00:25:04.896
sense of what this Tuxpin's all about.

00:25:04.896 --> 00:25:07.361
LIAM: Peddy, don't hurt him.

00:25:07.361 --> 00:25:11.811
BRIAN: He seems quite serious.

00:25:11.811 --> 00:25:16.140
MATT: As a fellow bear who has immediately stared
at my junk, I feel it is only right and fair that

00:25:16.140 --> 00:25:17.780
I accept your challenge.

00:25:17.780 --> 00:25:19.603
SAM: Oh, we're going to do this! Paws up!

00:25:19.603 --> 00:25:22.050
MATT: (collision sounds)

00:25:22.050 --> 00:25:29.526
MARISHA: I'd say, roll a bear-off. You get
advantage, Peddy.

00:25:29.526 --> 00:25:31.571
TALIESIN and MARISHA: Paw-wrestling.

00:25:31.571 --> 00:25:35.865
SAM: Oh, okay, a one is my better stat.

00:25:35.865 --> 00:25:38.576
MATT: No, I don't. I have a four.

00:25:38.576 --> 00:25:44.608
MARISHA: Without fail, Peddy, like a sprig of
bamboo, snaps all the way back.

00:25:44.608 --> 00:25:46.558
SAM: Oh shit! You okay?

00:25:46.558 --> 00:25:50.207
MATT: All right, we need some muscle. You've
proven yourself worthy. Do I move a point for

00:25:50.207 --> 00:25:52.104
failing the roll?

00:25:52.104 --> 00:25:55.737
MARISHA: Do you feel aggravated? You agreed to it.
You're fine. Not yet.

00:25:55.737 --> 00:25:59.683
TALIESIN: Pandas, they're fighters, not lovers.

00:25:59.683 --> 00:26:04.529
MATT: So, we got muscle. What do you two brothers
got at the table?

00:26:04.529 --> 00:26:05.917
MARISHA: Roll d6s.

00:26:05.917 --> 00:26:09.323
TALIESIN: One.

00:26:09.323 --> 00:26:13.069
MARISHA: Do you want to still also be a muscle, or
would you like to re-roll?

00:26:13.069 --> 00:26:14.893
TALIESIN: No, let's roll that. Four.

00:26:14.893 --> 00:26:19.593
MARISHA: All right. Cookie, you're the brains of
the group.

00:26:19.593 --> 00:26:21.245
LIAM: Of course I am.

00:26:21.245 --> 00:26:25.218
MARISHA: Waffle, you're the hacker.

00:26:25.218 --> 00:26:29.154
(laughter)

00:26:29.154 --> 00:26:31.124
LIAM: A hacker bear!

00:26:31.124 --> 00:26:33.169
SAM: What do we need a hacker for?!

00:26:33.169 --> 00:26:35.321
MATT: Do we write our roles down on our sheet?

00:26:35.321 --> 00:26:37.783
MARISHA: Yes, write your roles down.

00:26:37.783 --> 00:26:42.934
LIAM: Let me tell you, we've hit all the biggest
places. We've hit Vasselheim. We have hit Stilben,

00:26:42.934 --> 00:26:50.532
okay. We've been to the Briarwoods' home turf, and
we got all their fucking honey. We're going to get

00:26:50.532 --> 00:26:54.727
this honey because this fucking guy is going to
hack the system.

00:26:54.727 --> 00:26:58.505
TALIESIN: I can hack anything. Anything you need.
I can hack doors! I can hack people! I can hack

00:26:58.505 --> 00:27:00.476
cities, hack right through them.

00:27:00.476 --> 00:27:03.729
BRIAN: Even with those stubby fingers?

00:27:03.729 --> 00:27:07.949
TALIESIN: Hey man, you know how to hack? Then
don't be talking to me about my business.

00:27:07.949 --> 00:27:11.648
MARISHA: What do you know how to do, Liam Las
Vegas?

00:27:11.648 --> 00:27:13.592
TALIESIN: What exactly do you do, honey badger?

00:27:13.592 --> 00:27:14.792
BRIAN: Two.

00:27:14.792 --> 00:27:15.946
SAM: Re-roll.

00:27:15.946 --> 00:27:24.793
BRIAN: No. No. No. Yeah! Three.

00:27:24.793 --> 00:27:27.427
MARISHA: You're the driver.

00:27:27.427 --> 00:27:32.332
BRIAN: Yeah! Yeah, all right! I'll be the driver.

00:27:32.332 --> 00:27:35.316
SAM: What's your deal?

00:27:35.316 --> 00:27:37.874
BRIAN: I'm the driver!

00:27:37.874 --> 00:27:41.658
LIAM: Where's our ride at? What are we taking this
time?

00:27:41.658 --> 00:27:45.876
BRIAN: Well, we've got a horse and buggy.

00:27:45.876 --> 00:27:48.138
MARISHA: You're going to have to pick up a ride.

00:27:48.138 --> 00:27:55.337
BRIAN: We're going to pick up a ride. Don't worry,
I have super high criminal-risma.

00:27:55.337 --> 00:28:03.402
MARISHA: All right, Trinket, you're the last one.

00:28:03.402 --> 00:28:08.733
MATT: So it looks like we got a nice selection of
abilities, here. So let me tell you what I have to

00:28:08.733 --> 00:28:15.312
offer. One, I know where the honey is. Two, I know
the people probably around it. Three--

00:28:15.312 --> 00:28:19.218
MARISHA: It's anything-- A five? You're a thief.

00:28:19.218 --> 00:28:20.860
SAM: Well, that makes sense.

00:28:20.860 --> 00:28:23.546
BRIAN: Just like your mom!

00:28:23.546 --> 00:28:29.928
MATT: Let me tell you. I've learned a few tricks
from the two that raised me, so that honey's going

00:28:29.928 --> 00:28:31.722
to be as good as ours.

00:28:31.722 --> 00:28:42.191
SAM: I feel like now would be a good time for me
to confess that I don't really like, I've never

00:28:42.191 --> 00:28:45.199
had honey. I eat bamboo, mostly.

00:28:45.199 --> 00:28:46.731
BRIAN: Is it a gluten thing?

00:28:46.731 --> 00:28:51.939
SAM: No no, I just haven't had it. Just don't have
it much where I come from.

00:28:51.939 --> 00:28:55.202
LIAM: You take the bamboo and you stir it around
in the honey. You have them together.

00:28:55.202 --> 00:28:58.045
SAM: That would be good? Okay.

00:28:58.045 --> 00:29:00.988
LIAM: It's like celery and peanut butter. Don't
knock it.

00:29:00.988 --> 00:29:07.451
BRIAN: Did you bring any bamboo with you, in a
sack or something?

00:29:07.451 --> 00:29:08.765
SAM: Did I?

00:29:08.765 --> 00:29:12.381
MARISHA: Did you bring any bamboo? Mm, nah.

00:29:12.381 --> 00:29:16.175
SAM: I ate it on the way here. I eat a lot.

00:29:16.175 --> 00:29:22.797
MARISHA: You also like to eat anything that kind
of remotely resembles bamboo.

00:29:22.797 --> 00:29:27.279
TALIESIN: He's going to get hangry. You're not
going to like him when he's hangry.

00:29:27.279 --> 00:29:33.080
LIAM: All right. Our newfound friend, Trinket.
What can you tell us about this town? Where the

00:29:33.080 --> 00:29:35.901
honey is? What are we working with, here, buddy?

00:29:35.901 --> 00:29:39.795
MATT: All them banners you see out there beyond
the walls? This is a goddamned celebration.

00:29:39.795 --> 00:29:46.767
There's a contest in there. My ears picked it up.
In the middle of that contest area, I can smell

00:29:46.767 --> 00:29:53.032
it, there's all the honey we could ever hope for.
Possibly even some bamboo. Keep your eyes open.

00:29:53.032 --> 00:29:59.608
Now all we have to do is get inside, so, if you're
the brains, what do you suggest?

00:29:59.608 --> 00:30:05.316
LIAM: We need some kind of distraction. We're
going to dress as people. That's the plan.

00:30:05.316 --> 00:30:10.933
SAM: Dress as people? How's that going to work? We
all look giant.

00:30:10.933 --> 00:30:17.033
MARISHA: Trinket, your ears pick up in the
distance: "Hats! Get your hats!"

00:30:17.033 --> 00:30:27.135
MATT: I'm going to immediately go: I think you're
onto something! Cookie, Waffle, Liam Las Vegas,

00:30:27.135 --> 00:30:31.475
Peddy Bear, let's go get us some hats.

00:30:31.475 --> 00:30:39.193
MARISHA: He's about a hundred yards away, entering
into the south entrance of the city, about to

00:30:39.193 --> 00:30:41.285
cross the threshold.

00:30:41.285 --> 00:30:46.784
MATT: Okay. Do we want to try and quickly and
quietly make our way up behind?

00:30:46.784 --> 00:30:49.805
SAM: Well, what do we see?

00:30:49.805 --> 00:30:55.747
BRIAN: I would technically be the smallest,
correct? Being a honey badger rather than a bear?

00:30:55.747 --> 00:31:03.277
I could maybe, if I need to slip by unnoticed, to
grab a couple of things and bring them back to you guys?

00:31:03.277 --> 00:31:08.681
LIAM: That's right, here's what we're going to do,
okay? Cookie and Waffle, we're going to fuck shit up,

00:31:08.681 --> 00:31:13.067
all right? We're going to get in the garbage,
we're going to start fucking with people's shit. I

00:31:13.067 --> 00:31:17.856
might even scare a little kid. When that
happens, you're in. You grab as many fucking hats

00:31:17.856 --> 00:31:21.392
as you can, and you skedaddle back. We meet up
together and then we choose which hats we're going

00:31:21.392 --> 00:31:25.192
to wear, and which makes us look most human, or
elf, or halfling in your case.

00:31:25.192 --> 00:31:31.504
BRIAN: Okay, but one question. Let me know any
size preferences or style before. I don't want to

00:31:31.504 --> 00:31:34.935
come back and then have a big argument, and then I
got to go back again.

00:31:34.935 --> 00:31:37.055
MATT: Mr. Las Vegas, surprise us.

00:31:37.055 --> 00:31:39.819
BRIAN: All right. I can do it.

00:31:39.819 --> 00:31:42.107
MARISHA: All right, Liam, you--

00:31:42.107 --> 00:31:43.565
LIAM: Oh, shit. Sorry.

00:31:43.565 --> 00:31:44.947
MARISHA: Las Vegas.

00:31:44.947 --> 00:31:46.593
MATT: We'll call you Vegas. You're Vegas.

00:31:46.593 --> 00:31:49.482
MARISHA: Goddamn you.

00:31:49.482 --> 00:31:51.491
BRIAN: Vegas strong, baby.

00:31:51.491 --> 00:31:58.448
MARISHA: Vegas, you skitter on down past, using
the rocks and the fauna to dodge as you get up

00:31:58.448 --> 00:32:04.335
close behind the guy. Cookie and Waffle, were you
guys--?

00:32:04.335 --> 00:32:08.752
TALIESIN: I say we split up. You take the bottom
of the road, I take the top.

00:32:08.752 --> 00:32:12.198
LIAM: Okay, what I'm going to do is I'm going to
scare a bunch of little children. I want you to

00:32:12.198 --> 00:32:15.252
start tearing down the festive decorations that
you see.

00:32:15.252 --> 00:32:16.743
TALIESIN: You want me to hack those decorations?

00:32:16.743 --> 00:32:20.121
LIAM: Hack the decorations the fuck off the walls
and make a lot of noise, Waffle.

00:32:20.121 --> 00:32:21.779
TALIESIN: All right, it's going to be a loud hack.

00:32:21.779 --> 00:32:27.378
SAM: Boss, you need me to do anything?

00:32:27.378 --> 00:32:29.847
TALIESIN: If anyone tries to stop us--

00:32:29.847 --> 00:32:32.611
LIAM: You got a suggestion, Trinket?

00:32:32.611 --> 00:32:36.640
MATT: I'm just going to say, be careful about too
much mayhem. We don't want people to suspect

00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:40.794
there's bears running wild around the city. They
might shut down the festival. Then the honey is--

00:32:40.794 --> 00:32:44.559
So if you're going to do a scare, do it and get
out.

00:32:44.559 --> 00:32:51.801
MARISHA: All right. Waffle and Cookie? Flank from
the sides. As you start getting up to the wall of

00:32:51.801 --> 00:32:57.316
the city, you see two guards standing at the
entrance, nodding and greeting people, letting

00:32:57.316 --> 00:33:04.068
them go in as they go. You see a few banners hung
up along the wall. Few flowers.

00:33:04.068 --> 00:33:09.918
TALIESIN: I'm going to hack a couple banners down.
We have a brief disguise. Going to hack a couple

00:33:09.918 --> 00:33:10.775
banners.

00:33:10.775 --> 00:33:13.716
LIAM: You said there's a couple of soldiers,
guards?

00:33:13.716 --> 00:33:15.507
MARISHA: Couple of guards, yeah. Couple of
shields.

00:33:15.507 --> 00:33:17.150
LIAM: Are there any kids in sight?

00:33:17.150 --> 00:33:23.926
MARISHA: There's maybe one or two coming in,
families coming in and filtering into the city for

00:33:23.926 --> 00:33:25.939
the festival. Most people seem to be inside.

00:33:25.939 --> 00:33:28.241
LIAM: Between me and them? Or are the kids open
season, you know what I'm saying?

00:33:28.241 --> 00:33:33.126
MARISHA: Kids are currently open season, yeah. You
see a mom and dad, two kids, typical looking

00:33:33.126 --> 00:33:40.575
family out for a nice day. You see another kid
going along in with one of the vendors. They've

00:33:40.575 --> 00:33:42.396
got some vegetables on their back.

00:33:42.396 --> 00:33:45.768
TALIESIN: We wrap ourselves in these banners that
I've pulled down. Then they won't know that we're

00:33:45.768 --> 00:33:47.695
bears. We'll just be giant flying banners.

00:33:47.695 --> 00:33:49.002
LIAM: They might think we're ghosts.

00:33:49.002 --> 00:33:51.452
TALIESIN: They might be ghosts, and then they'll
be prepared for ghosts. They'll never see us

00:33:51.452 --> 00:33:52.363
coming.

00:33:52.363 --> 00:33:54.444
LIAM: Yeah. They'll try to turn us and it won't
work.

00:33:54.444 --> 00:33:56.060
TALIESIN: Nope, ain't going to do a thing.

00:33:56.060 --> 00:34:00.920
MARISHA: Liam Las Vegas, as this is happening, you
get up right behind. You follow in. You're about

00:34:00.920 --> 00:34:12.072
maybe five feet out from the back of Theobald the
Bold, the best hat vendor in town. Theobald the

00:34:12.072 --> 00:34:19.226
Bold, is because his hat's the boldest. He's a
little halfling dude with scrappy clothes, but

00:34:19.226 --> 00:34:24.589
his hat looks way overpriced in comparison to
everything else. He's hunched, he's got a

00:34:24.589 --> 00:34:26.779
pull-behind wagon piled with hats.

00:34:26.779 --> 00:34:30.773
TALIESIN: Really leaning into it, isn't he?

00:34:30.773 --> 00:34:33.327
MARISHA: "Get your hats! Festival hats!"

00:34:33.327 --> 00:34:35.184
SAM: Go, Las Vegas! Go!

00:34:35.184 --> 00:34:39.570
TALIESIN: I'm going to hack the banners.

00:34:39.570 --> 00:34:43.225
MARISHA: All right, as this is happening, you
start hacking the banner. Roll for criminal.

00:34:43.225 --> 00:34:45.694
That's a double if you're a hacker.

00:34:45.694 --> 00:34:48.527
TALIESIN: Yeah! Two.

00:34:48.527 --> 00:34:56.815
MARISHA: All right, you're a little tangled in
them. The pendants are getting in your face a

00:34:56.815 --> 00:34:59.356
little bit. What are you doing, Cookie?

00:34:59.356 --> 00:35:04.289
LIAM: While I get covered up, I'm going to start
running towards the kids and yell as loud as I can

00:35:04.289 --> 00:35:06.333
like this (intimidating scream).

00:35:06.333 --> 00:35:07.741
MARISHA: The kids (terrified screaming).

00:35:07.741 --> 00:35:11.266
LIAM: I'm going to take a shit and then I'm going
to slap it at the grownups' heads that are with

00:35:11.266 --> 00:35:16.762
the kids. (screams)

00:35:16.762 --> 00:35:25.290
MARISHA: About this time, the dad goes, "Guards!
Bears! Get help!" About this time, one of the

00:35:25.290 --> 00:35:31.464
guards looks over at the other one and goes, "Aw
Glennon, we have a bear attack!" They start running

00:35:31.464 --> 00:35:36.044
after you, banging their shields against the
spears going, (yelling) "Get away!"

00:35:36.044 --> 00:35:37.874
LIAM: I start flinging shit at them!

00:35:37.874 --> 00:35:44.074
MARISHA: "Aw, they're those shit-flinging bears,
Glennon!" (yelling) they're trying to block it.

00:35:44.074 --> 00:35:45.557
Roll for criminal.

00:35:45.557 --> 00:35:47.259
LIAM: Criminal is for flinging shit?

00:35:47.259 --> 00:35:52.028
MARISHA: Roll for bear. I guess you are being more
of a bear than the brains right now.

00:35:52.085 --> 00:35:58.429
LIAM: This is the smartest idea that any bear has
ever had. It's a two!

00:35:58.429 --> 00:36:07.520
MARISHA: You successfully fling shit. As the
guards try to duck and cover, one gets hit right

00:36:07.520 --> 00:36:13.370
in the right eye and he's like, "Aw!" And they
start jabbing at you guys with spears.

00:36:13.370 --> 00:36:14.413
LIAM: We're out!

00:36:14.413 --> 00:36:16.402
TALIESIN: Let's take them out. We're leading them
away from the hats.

00:36:16.402 --> 00:36:23.054
MARISHA: They chase you off, probably a good 50 or
so yards off around the corner.

00:36:23.054 --> 00:36:24.795
TALIESIN: We'll go into the woods, where you're
supposed to poop.

00:36:24.795 --> 00:36:26.809
LIAM: Right. As we're running, I yell: Hack the
system!

00:36:26.809 --> 00:36:33.610
MARISHA: "I think those bears were rabid. Pretty
sure, but we probably should have put them down."

00:36:33.610 --> 00:36:40.190
They slowly walk back. In this time-- how many
hats?

00:36:40.190 --> 00:36:44.118
BRIAN: How many do you think I could carry? Ten?

00:36:44.118 --> 00:36:51.482
MARISHA: You could probably do a few darts and
hide a few in this time. Roll for criminal.

00:36:51.482 --> 00:36:58.887
BRIAN: Okay. Four. No good.

00:36:58.887 --> 00:37:03.007
MARISHA: About this time, in the distraction--

00:37:03.007 --> 00:37:04.655
BRIAN: Have I gotten any away yet?

00:37:04.655 --> 00:37:09.380
MARISHA: Yeah, you got a nice, solid haul. As
you're trying to go for your bonus hats, Theobald

00:37:09.380 --> 00:37:15.221
turns around and goes, "Rats! There's bears and
rats! Get out!"

00:37:15.221 --> 00:37:16.738
BRIAN: I'm not a rat, you piece of shit!

00:37:16.738 --> 00:37:23.481
MARISHA: He stomps at you. "Aw, look, he knocked
over my hats." Starts scooping up the ones.

00:37:23.481 --> 00:37:25.017
BRIAN: I have claws, right?

00:37:25.017 --> 00:37:26.535
MARISHA: Little bit.

00:37:26.535 --> 00:37:29.330
BRIAN: Just want to get him in the butt.

00:37:29.330 --> 00:37:30.865
SAM: Oh right, attack?

00:37:30.865 --> 00:37:32.058
MARISHA: Oh, you're attacking?

00:37:32.058 --> 00:37:33.414
BRIAN: Just going to (boing).

00:37:33.414 --> 00:37:39.415
MARISHA: Roll 2d6 and roll for the lowest under
bear. You have carnage.

00:37:39.415 --> 00:37:40.956
LIAM: Are you going to poke him in the gooch?

00:37:40.956 --> 00:37:43.602
MATT: A one and a two!

00:37:43.602 --> 00:37:52.297
MARISHA: Okay! Theobald goes (yelps) and takes off
running. A few more fall off and you take the

00:37:52.297 --> 00:37:58.337
extra hats.You guys all slowly get back. You
reconvene. That actually went off pretty well,

00:37:58.337 --> 00:38:05.120
considering, so you guys each put a point into
criminal. Waffle, Cookie, and Liam Las Vegas.

00:38:05.120 --> 00:38:07.003
LIAM: Do we take it away from bear when we put it
into criminal?

00:38:07.003 --> 00:38:09.519
MARISHA: Take one away from bear, put it into
criminal.

00:38:09.519 --> 00:38:15.543
MATT: As they're approaching him, I'm talking to
Peddy. There's not a whole lot of space in the

00:38:15.543 --> 00:38:19.833
necklace, it's pretty cramped. At least I have a
pretty good view; it's like a tiny television.

00:38:19.833 --> 00:38:23.587
They're here! All right. How'd it go?

00:38:23.587 --> 00:38:26.414
LIAM and BRIAN: We got hats!

00:38:26.414 --> 00:38:28.325
MATT: You got hats and you smell like shit.

00:38:28.325 --> 00:38:36.445
BRIAN: Does a bear shit on the Pope? I got hats of
every kind you want. We got big ones, I don't know

00:38:36.445 --> 00:38:37.351
what I got.

00:38:37.351 --> 00:38:40.050
MARISHA: Everyone roll a d8! A d8 please!

00:38:40.050 --> 00:38:45.807
BRIAN: I need to borrow one. Oh wait, I have
Marisha's Wyrmwood.

00:38:45.807 --> 00:38:49.842
TALIESIN and BRIAN: Six.

00:38:49.842 --> 00:38:52.233
SAM: Oh, we got three sixes.

00:38:52.233 --> 00:38:55.881
MARISHA: Three sixes. You two sixes reroll because
this is the one hat that I only have one of.

00:38:55.881 --> 00:38:56.747
BRIAN: Five.

00:38:56.747 --> 00:38:57.770
TALIESIN: Eight.

00:38:57.770 --> 00:38:58.867
LIAM: Two.

00:38:58.867 --> 00:39:01.333
MARISHA: You roll twice, you get two hats!

00:39:01.333 --> 00:39:06.003
MARISHA: Peddy, this fez looks real attractive to
you.

00:39:06.003 --> 00:39:07.719
TALIESIN: There's a second fez!

00:39:07.719 --> 00:39:09.341
LIAM: That's the best one!

00:39:09.341 --> 00:39:12.028
TALIESIN: It's inside the other hats. It's in one
of the top hats.

00:39:12.028 --> 00:39:14.812
MATT: Taliesin, do you want a fez and another hat
then?

00:39:14.812 --> 00:39:21.084
MARISHA: You'll get a fez and one more hat, so
roll again. What did you roll, five? Two.

00:39:21.084 --> 00:39:24.410
TALIESIN: I rolled an eight again. It's me! I'm
just going to roll the highest possible over and

00:39:24.410 --> 00:39:25.710
over again.

00:39:25.710 --> 00:39:28.259
MARISHA: What color top hat would you like?

00:39:28.259 --> 00:39:29.909
LIAM: Oh my god, what are my options?

00:39:29.909 --> 00:39:33.717
MARISHA: Black, green, and a leathery tan.

00:39:33.717 --> 00:39:35.791
LIAM: Holy shit, I'll take leathery tan.

00:39:35.791 --> 00:39:38.560
TALIESIN: There's a gray one, too.

00:39:38.560 --> 00:39:40.360
LIAM: Oh my god!

00:39:40.360 --> 00:39:42.758
MATT: That's a Willy Wonka hat!

00:39:42.758 --> 00:39:48.585
LIAM: Holy fuckballs, I am a happy bear. Woohoo!

00:39:48.585 --> 00:39:54.994
MARISHA: Trinket, you get a trilby. What did you
roll again, Liam Las Vegas?

00:39:54.994 --> 00:39:56.218
BRIAN: Five.

00:39:56.218 --> 00:39:58.060
LIAM: That is so confusing.

00:39:58.060 --> 00:40:00.525
BRIAN: I did it just to fuck with you.

00:40:00.525 --> 00:40:03.261
MARISHA: Which cowboy hat do you want?

00:40:03.261 --> 00:40:06.609
BRIAN: Holy fucking shit, you give me that one in
your left hand right this moment.

00:40:06.609 --> 00:40:09.921
TALIESIN: I get a second hat?

00:40:09.921 --> 00:40:11.030
MARISHA: You get a second hat.

00:40:11.030 --> 00:40:12.634
TALIESIN: I rolled an eight again. So now I rolled
a six.

00:40:12.634 --> 00:40:15.942
MARISHA: Roll again because a six is still a fez.

00:40:15.942 --> 00:40:17.224
TALIESIN: I rolled an eight again.

00:40:17.224 --> 00:40:18.442
MARISHA: Roll again.

00:40:18.442 --> 00:40:19.583
TALIESIN: I rolled a three.

00:40:19.583 --> 00:40:21.614
MATT: So you can put three hats on?!

00:40:21.614 --> 00:40:24.689
TALIESIN: I was just going to keep rolling eights
until something else happened.

00:40:24.689 --> 00:40:26.333
MARISHA: What color bowler?

00:40:26.333 --> 00:40:30.504
TALIESIN: The green bowler. Been a while.

00:40:30.504 --> 00:40:32.714
MARISHA: You get to wear a hat on a hat if you
want!

00:40:32.714 --> 00:40:35.460
TALIESIN: I'm going to wear a fez on a bowler.

00:40:35.460 --> 00:40:37.122
MARISHA: Fez on a bowler, there you go.

00:40:37.122 --> 00:40:38.210
MATT: A fowler.

00:40:38.210 --> 00:40:39.371
MARISHA: A fowler?

00:40:39.371 --> 00:40:41.243
SAM: That works.

00:40:41.243 --> 00:40:43.342
LIAM: Jeez, you're that guy in a western.

00:40:43.342 --> 00:40:45.466
SAM: You just hacked that hat.

00:40:45.466 --> 00:40:47.472
TALIESIN: There we are.

00:40:47.472 --> 00:40:55.656
MARISHA: You guys are feeling pretty good about
your hats.

00:40:55.656 --> 00:40:57.595
MATT: This is worth the price of admission, right
here.

00:40:57.595 --> 00:41:02.715
LIAM: Somebody get an organ grinder, stat!
(sings)

00:41:02.715 --> 00:41:05.555
BRIAN: Sam looks like Beary Busey!

00:41:05.555 --> 00:41:12.077
(laughter)

00:41:12.077 --> 00:41:13.870
MARISHA: That's a good code name.

00:41:13.870 --> 00:41:14.924
MATT: Hey Vegas.

00:41:14.924 --> 00:41:15.969
BRIAN: Yeah?

00:41:15.969 --> 00:41:21.522
MATT: Good job. With these hats, there's no way
anybody in the town of Westruun would think that

00:41:21.522 --> 00:41:22.574
we're bears.

00:41:22.574 --> 00:41:25.205
BRIAN: Had to poke a little butt to get them, but
in the end--

00:41:25.205 --> 00:41:27.240
MATT: Haven't we all?

00:41:27.240 --> 00:41:28.636
BRIAN: The butt went away.

00:41:28.636 --> 00:41:34.375
LIAM: I have another brilliant idea.

00:41:34.375 --> 00:41:36.331
MATT: What you got, Cookie?

00:41:36.331 --> 00:41:42.900
LIAM: We ripped down these banners. My brother hacked
the system. They're really big. I can tear this

00:41:42.900 --> 00:41:48.855
shit with my claw and make each of us a cloak to go
with our hats. Then we'll look even more human.

00:41:48.929 --> 00:41:53.542
SAM: You are smarter than the average us!

00:41:53.542 --> 00:41:57.622
LIAM: Three years in bear college, my friend!

00:41:57.622 --> 00:41:58.895
SAM: Oh wow!

00:41:58.895 --> 00:42:01.903
BRIAN: Wait, how many years?

00:42:01.903 --> 00:42:06.691
LIAM: Three.

00:42:06.691 --> 00:42:08.020
BRIAN: Wow!

00:42:08.020 --> 00:42:09.280
SAM: Getting hungry.

00:42:09.280 --> 00:42:11.565
MATT: That's right, we've got some honey to get
to. Come on, guys.

00:42:11.565 --> 00:42:16.776
MARISHA: With that confidence, you stroll right on
up. See if you can test your luck with the guards,

00:42:16.776 --> 00:42:17.948
I guess.

00:42:17.948 --> 00:42:23.482
LIAM: Here's your cloak. Red cloak. Red cloak.
We're going to be the black cloaks.

00:42:23.482 --> 00:42:29.662
MARISHA: They're like giant pendants that you put
holes in, so you've got nice little ascots now.

00:42:29.662 --> 00:42:35.624
Very distinguished! Very festive!

00:42:35.624 --> 00:42:38.005
MATT: Stand up on our hind legs as vertical as we
can.

00:42:38.005 --> 00:42:41.797
TALIESIN: We are hirsute gentlemen!

00:42:41.797 --> 00:42:51.356
MARISHA: As you walk by, the one guard was like,
"Aw, jeez, do I still have shit in my eye? Oh,

00:42:51.356 --> 00:42:56.680
"welcome to the Hazel Festival, sirs. Go on in.
Jeez, can we go get Wet Wipes?"

00:42:56.680 --> 00:42:58.761
LIAM: Keep it moving! Bidet!

00:42:58.761 --> 00:43:01.397
MATT and TALIESIN: (growling) Bidet!

00:43:01.397 --> 00:43:14.720
MARISHA: "Were those goliaths? Okay, let's go take
a break." You successfully enter the city. Is my

00:43:14.720 --> 00:43:15.979
music going?

00:43:15.979 --> 00:43:19.816
MATT: It's going, yeah! I hear it.

00:43:19.816 --> 00:43:27.020
MARISHA: As you get closer into the city, you can
smell wonderful foods. You can see people bringing

00:43:27.020 --> 00:43:35.024
in prized vegetables and they're entering them
into competitions. There's string quartets and

00:43:35.024 --> 00:43:41.334
people dancing in the streets. Mead vendors out in
the open. As you get closer, you actually see a

00:43:41.334 --> 00:43:48.855
three-story-tall, really derpy-looking statue of a
Westruun man with a cowboy hat, he's wearing a

00:43:48.855 --> 00:43:54.874
button down that looks a lot like the Texas state
flag. He's got a shitty voice box saying, "Welcome

00:43:54.874 --> 00:44:05.739
"to the Hazel Festival! Welcome to the Hazel--" and
it repeats every 30 seconds or so. Things are

00:44:05.739 --> 00:44:07.076
decorated around it.

00:44:07.076 --> 00:44:08.622
LIAM: You're in a Johnny Cab!

00:44:08.622 --> 00:44:19.210
MARISHA: Cookie, Waffle. You notice the scent of
honey wafting through the air. Peddy Tuxpin, you

00:44:19.210 --> 00:44:27.722
notice the scent of bamboo in the air. It's a
little dried out and as you look down, you notice

00:44:27.722 --> 00:44:34.750
these little wooden bamboo sample spoons that have
been discarded all over the floor.

00:44:34.750 --> 00:44:36.624
SAM: I'm going to pick them up and eat them.

00:44:36.624 --> 00:44:43.037
MARISHA: It tastes like it's got honey residual on
it. It's scraps, but there's some little drops of

00:44:43.037 --> 00:44:44.593
honey in sample cups.

00:44:44.593 --> 00:44:47.635
MATT: Peddy, people don't eat spoons off the
floor.

00:44:47.635 --> 00:44:49.990
SAM: Oh people, we're people, right.

00:44:49.990 --> 00:44:54.155
MATT: We're people. Just grab them, hold them, and
we'll find a corner for you to have a feast.

00:44:54.155 --> 00:44:59.397
SAM: I pick them up. I pop one in my mouth like a
sucker.

00:44:59.397 --> 00:45:03.234
MARISHA: All right. You guys taste some.

00:45:03.234 --> 00:45:05.377
LIAM: Everybody act casual.

00:45:05.377 --> 00:45:07.414
SAM: It's like a cigarette.

00:45:07.414 --> 00:45:12.920
MATT: I can't pinpoint the source of the honey.
Any of you boys?

00:45:12.920 --> 00:45:14.627
TALIESIN: I'm going to try to pinpoint the source
of the honey.

00:45:14.627 --> 00:45:16.306
LIAM: Same. I smell gold.

00:45:16.306 --> 00:45:21.692
MARISHA: Roll for bear.

00:45:21.692 --> 00:45:25.151
TALIESIN and LIAM: Nope.

00:45:25.151 --> 00:45:27.568
TALIESIN: I'm frustrated.

00:45:27.568 --> 00:45:30.068
MARISHA: Are you getting a little frustrated?

00:45:30.068 --> 00:45:31.296
TALIESIN: Yep.

00:45:31.296 --> 00:45:36.344
MARISHA: Then take and put a point into bear. It's
got to be lower than bear.

00:45:36.344 --> 00:45:38.908
LIAM: We're in trouble there.

00:45:38.908 --> 00:45:44.514
TALIESIN: There's a lot going on. We got to get
close to the source. There's too much happening.

00:45:44.514 --> 00:45:50.881
Bamboo's getting in there, it's mucking up the
system, man. This is a delicate instrument.

00:45:50.881 --> 00:45:57.027
SAM: Guys, is this plan off the rails already?
Should I be worried? I'm freaking out!

00:45:57.027 --> 00:46:02.186
BRIAN: We got these great hats.

00:46:02.186 --> 00:46:04.207
SAM: These people are looking at us funny!

00:46:04.207 --> 00:46:10.686
MARISHA: About this time, you see an old couple
run by going, "Help! Has anyone seen any cows? We

00:46:10.686 --> 00:46:15.527
"lost our prized steer!" She's like, "Gerald, I
told you you should have tied them up!"

00:46:15.527 --> 00:46:17.952
LIAM: What the fuck is this shit?

00:46:17.952 --> 00:46:25.506
MARISHA: As they run by, you see Pike way off in
the distance. She's saying, "Anyone would like a

00:46:25.506 --> 00:46:31.409
"honey sample? Honey sample! Anybody? This is from
the Slayer's Cake! Vote for the Slayer's Cake!"

00:46:31.409 --> 00:46:34.727
LIAM: Holy shit, we eat the gnome and then we get
the honey.

00:46:34.727 --> 00:46:36.723
MATT: Nobody is eating the gnome!

00:46:36.723 --> 00:46:38.011
SAM: But she's so little!

00:46:38.011 --> 00:46:39.214
LIAM: She's covered in honey!

00:46:39.214 --> 00:46:41.731
MATT: She will destroy you, trust me.

00:46:41.731 --> 00:46:43.759
BRIAN: Is she poisonous if you bite into her?

00:46:43.759 --> 00:46:45.351
MATT: Sure, we'll go with that.

00:46:45.351 --> 00:46:52.003
MARISHA: On the other side, you see Reginald's
daughter. What was her name? Aleria? It's

00:46:52.003 --> 00:46:59.486
somewhere in my notes. But it's Reginald's
daughter and she's going, "Honey samples! Try it

00:46:59.486 --> 00:47:03.606
"from the Reginald farm! Honey samples!"

00:47:03.606 --> 00:47:05.450
MATT: That one we could go towards.

00:47:05.450 --> 00:47:06.595
SAM: And kill her?

00:47:06.595 --> 00:47:10.232
MATT: I'm going to approach and tell the other
guys to come along.

00:47:10.232 --> 00:47:13.748
SAM: We're going to talk to her? I'm freaking
out.

00:47:13.748 --> 00:47:15.488
MATT: It's all right, just suck on your spoon.

00:47:15.488 --> 00:47:16.937
SAM: I might just kill her.

00:47:16.937 --> 00:47:19.772
MATT: As I approach Reginald's daughter--

00:47:19.772 --> 00:47:26.493
MARISHA: Still really trying to find her. Damn, I
just wrote down Reginald's daughter. Ameera or

00:47:26.493 --> 00:47:29.659
something? Aleria, or Amelia? We'll call her
Amelia.

00:47:29.659 --> 00:47:36.433
MATT: I approach with my big bear arms at the
side, my cloak over my armor and my delightful

00:47:36.433 --> 00:47:40.228
cap. Get close to the honey and (sniff).

00:47:40.228 --> 00:47:51.008
MARISHA: She looks at you a little confused and
goes, "Hello?"

00:47:51.008 --> 00:47:54.130
MATT: (bear voice) Thank you.

00:47:54.130 --> 00:48:04.491
MARISHA: She turns around to a friend and is like,
"I'm not one to judge, but--" She shuffles away, a

00:48:04.491 --> 00:48:07.873
little uncomfortable.

00:48:07.873 --> 00:48:13.051
MATT: I took a bite of it, a little bit. I take
the rest of it and hold it out and say: One of you

00:48:13.051 --> 00:48:17.916
bears, please, find the source of this goddamn
honey.

00:48:17.916 --> 00:48:19.880
BRIAN: Why did you give it to him?

00:48:19.880 --> 00:48:22.112
SAM: He said bears.

00:48:22.112 --> 00:48:23.386
BRIAN: Oh!

00:48:23.386 --> 00:48:27.023
LIAM: (groaning) It's good!

00:48:27.023 --> 00:48:28.527
TALIESIN: It's not bad!

00:48:28.527 --> 00:48:32.779
LIAM: I like you, city bear. I like you.

00:48:32.779 --> 00:48:34.330
TALIESIN: We're going places.

00:48:34.330 --> 00:48:38.435
LIAM: We could do big things together. I smell
honey, Waffle, I smell it!

00:48:38.435 --> 00:48:39.906
TALIESIN: Oh, I taste it.

00:48:39.906 --> 00:48:46.793
MARISHA: About this time, you see the last and
third contestant in the honey competition,

00:48:46.793 --> 00:48:55.072
wandering on the opposite side of the fountain.
He's going, "Yes! Vote for me! It's Victor! V

00:48:55.072 --> 00:49:06.061
"stands for voting! It's a secret recipe! Try my
secret recipe!" Trinket, you get this waft in the

00:49:06.061 --> 00:49:16.070
air and you're looking at the honey, it's got this
grayish tint to it. You recognize: this is the

00:49:16.070 --> 00:49:18.472
same smell that comes out of Percy's boom-boom
tube.

00:49:18.472 --> 00:49:22.310
MATT: Oh no. How many people are in the audience?

00:49:22.310 --> 00:49:23.428
MARISHA: A decent amount!

00:49:23.428 --> 00:49:24.687
MATT: Oh no!

00:49:24.687 --> 00:49:32.672
MARISHA: A decent amount, people are all over the
place, they're mixing in. They're going to Pike

00:49:32.672 --> 00:49:37.610
and then they're going to Victor, then they're
going to Reginald's daughter, they're jumping

00:49:37.610 --> 00:49:38.457
around.

00:49:38.457 --> 00:49:42.569
MATT: First and foremost, considering the utility
of that honey, I'm going to take a sample and pack

00:49:42.569 --> 00:49:45.357
it under my bear pit for later.

00:49:45.357 --> 00:49:49.385
MARISHA: "Vote for V!"

00:49:49.385 --> 00:49:50.908
MATT: (bear voice) Thank you!

00:49:50.908 --> 00:49:55.449
TALIESIN: I got an idea. I'm going to try
something. I'm going to wander up to Victor.

00:49:55.449 --> 00:49:59.407
MARISHA: "Hello there, hairy fellow! Would you
like some honey?"

00:49:59.407 --> 00:50:06.286
TALIESIN: I dip my paw just a little bit and go,
Mm!

00:50:06.286 --> 00:50:16.407
MARISHA: "Oh! You like it a lot, big guy? Okay!"
And he starts scooping it into the hat.

00:50:16.407 --> 00:50:19.042
TALIESIN: I'm going to fill the fez with honey.
With gunpowder honey.

00:50:19.042 --> 00:50:20.328
LIAM: That's about a hogshead worth.

00:50:20.328 --> 00:50:23.479
TALIESIN: About a hogshead worth. Easily have a
hogshead there.

00:50:23.479 --> 00:50:32.209
MARISHA: "Remember, vote for me, though! The V
stands-- vote for me!"

00:50:32.209 --> 00:50:34.421
TALIESIN: (amenable growling)

00:50:34.421 --> 00:50:38.539
BRIAN: Don't spill it!

00:50:38.539 --> 00:50:40.842
TALIESIN: We're in.

00:50:40.842 --> 00:50:47.381
MATT: Nobody jostle any of these townsfolk too
hard. They're probably a little sensitive at the

00:50:47.381 --> 00:50:48.760
moment.

00:50:48.760 --> 00:50:51.726
LIAM: Little gassy, you think?

00:50:51.726 --> 00:50:59.129
MATT: You'll see. We don't want that honey, we
have enough there. The prize honey is what that

00:50:59.129 --> 00:51:04.302
little one had earlier. Or (squishing) where this
came from.

00:51:04.302 --> 00:51:06.955
BRIAN: My goodness.

00:51:06.955 --> 00:51:12.078
MATT: I didn't think about my hat at the time. I
don't have pockets. I'm storing it in my bear pit.

00:51:12.078 --> 00:51:21.903
TALIESIN: That's Whitestone wildflower, touch of
Feywild star iris. That's good. That's real good.

00:51:21.903 --> 00:51:23.949
MATT: All right, lead us on.

00:51:23.949 --> 00:51:25.960
TALIESIN: (sniffs)

00:51:25.960 --> 00:51:28.072
MARISHA: Which direction are you guys going?

00:51:28.072 --> 00:51:31.415
LIAM: Wait a minute. You got a whole hatful of
honey. Can I have a little honey?

00:51:31.415 --> 00:51:34.313
MARISHA: You may certainly have honey.

00:51:34.313 --> 00:51:36.628
LIAM: I'm going take a little bite of this honey.

00:51:36.628 --> 00:51:38.393
TALIESIN: We're going to need this for later.

00:51:38.393 --> 00:51:45.439
MATT: As he's putting it in his mouth, I grab the
edge. Are you sure about this?

00:51:45.439 --> 00:51:48.116
LIAM: (swallows)

00:51:48.116 --> 00:51:57.000
MARISHA: It's good, all things considered. It's a
little smoky taste to it. Still tastes like honey,

00:51:57.000 --> 00:51:58.383
just a little sulfury.

00:51:58.383 --> 00:52:02.425
LIAM: I've had honey with jalapeno in it, a little
bit of hot pepper.

00:52:02.425 --> 00:52:04.737
MARISHA: It's gritty. It's got a little bit of
crunch in your teeth.

00:52:04.737 --> 00:52:06.630
BRIAN: Someone relieve themselves in the batch?

00:52:06.707 --> 00:52:08.306
MATT: More or less.

00:52:08.306 --> 00:52:13.895
LIAM: Texture. Does that put me back towards bear,
though?

00:52:13.895 --> 00:52:15.111
MARISHA: Huh?

00:52:15.111 --> 00:52:17.082
LIAM: I had some honey; don't we get towards bear
if we have honey?

00:52:17.082 --> 00:52:23.799
MARISHA: You have to have a nice pawful. You've
got to get a-- a sample's not going to work

00:52:23.799 --> 00:52:25.558
LIAM: All right.

00:52:25.558 --> 00:52:35.114
MARISHA: Once again, you might want to stockpile
some honey. It's not a bad idea. You hear a

00:52:35.114 --> 00:52:41.720
carnival barker come out on the stage built
temporarily on the town square. He goes, "Welcome,

00:52:41.720 --> 00:52:55.359
"everyone, the Fire Ashari cultural dance troupe!"
(drumbeat) Fire spinners come out and start doing

00:52:55.359 --> 00:53:05.007
fire poi. Fire breather comes out! Over the crowd.
Everyone's like, "Yeah!" They go rushing up to the stage.

00:53:05.007 --> 00:53:09.495
BRIAN: I run up and start dancing with all of
them, my drape flying everywhere.

00:53:09.495 --> 00:53:12.685
MARISHA: Drunk people are like, "Yeah, look at
this little guy!"

00:53:12.685 --> 00:53:16.142
SAM: I can't be here right now! No!

00:53:16.142 --> 00:53:21.194
MATT: Listen! You guys. We have to get those fire
dancers out of here or get the rest of these

00:53:21.194 --> 00:53:26.136
villagers out of the center here or we're all
dead. That honey you got right there, that touches

00:53:26.136 --> 00:53:29.756
any of that boom boom fire stick, we all go boom.

00:53:29.756 --> 00:53:32.153
TALIESIN: My god.

00:53:32.153 --> 00:53:39.047
BRIAN: I run back over. You guys! You got to come
up, oh man, it's crazy up front! Oh man, the

00:53:39.047 --> 00:53:40.491
honey's blue up there!

00:53:40.491 --> 00:53:42.670
SAM: I can't go up there, I'm scared of fire!

00:53:42.670 --> 00:53:51.198
MARISHA: You see a roaming, free-wandering chicken
that comes up and you can tell it's eating any and

00:53:51.198 --> 00:53:58.023
all trash that it comes across on the floor. As a
spark of ash, a piece of flint flies off the fire

00:53:58.023 --> 00:54:06.804
dancers and falls in front of it. Chicken eats it
mindlessly. (squawk) It explodes and bursts into a

00:54:06.804 --> 00:54:13.758
poof of feathers. Everyone turns, looks over in
your direction.

00:54:13.758 --> 00:54:21.241
MATT: I got a plan. Do you have a direction where
the honey's from that I gave you earlier?

00:54:21.241 --> 00:54:23.103
TALIESIN: I'm going to try to smell it again.

00:54:23.103 --> 00:54:24.011
MARISHA: All right.

00:54:24.011 --> 00:54:27.404
MATT: Please, for the love of god.

00:54:27.404 --> 00:54:32.355
TALIESIN: Yes! Yes I do! That way!

00:54:32.355 --> 00:54:38.154
MARISHA: You can smell that it's coming from the
Opal District a little bit, a really nice tavern

00:54:38.154 --> 00:54:40.522
called the Sun Kissed Inn in that direction.

00:54:40.522 --> 00:54:44.906
MATT: You guys start heading that way. I'll catch
up to you in a minute, I know where the Sun Kissed

00:54:44.906 --> 00:54:48.921
Tavern is. I'm going to try to save some lives.

00:54:48.921 --> 00:54:54.651
MARISHA: You bears split off into a back alleyway
and start following Cookie and Waffle.

00:54:54.651 --> 00:54:58.833
LIAM: I was liking that guy, but I don't know. We
don't need any martyrs in this group.

00:54:58.833 --> 00:55:07.094
MATT: As the townsfolk are gathering around this
fire troupe, I'm going to try to step between the

00:55:07.094 --> 00:55:15.543
threshold of where the various honey-eating folk
and the fire spinners are. Step into that central area.

00:55:15.543 --> 00:55:18.298
LIAM: What's the range on the Vex necklace?

00:55:18.298 --> 00:55:20.711
MATT: I don't know where she is, so we'll find
out.

00:55:20.711 --> 00:55:30.583
MARISHA: Yep, neither do I! She's real busy right
now. People are dancing and they're cheering,

00:55:30.583 --> 00:55:32.789
they're eating the honey. Really stoked.

00:55:32.789 --> 00:55:41.205
MATT: As they begin to encroach, I shake my head
for a second, pull my hat and cloak off, and

00:55:41.205 --> 00:55:48.537
(roar) towards all of the townsfolk, away from the
fire dancers. Attempting to use my terrify special skill.

00:55:48.537 --> 00:55:52.575
MARISHA: Roll 2d6 under bear and take the lower.

00:55:52.575 --> 00:55:56.032
MATT: Two and a three!

00:55:56.032 --> 00:56:02.292
MARISHA: Kids immediately get snapped out of their
dancing trance. Drunk people instantly sober.

00:56:02.292 --> 00:56:06.521
Everyone screams and takes off running into the
other direction.

00:56:06.521 --> 00:56:10.157
MATT: I turn around to the fire dancers.
(growling)

00:56:10.157 --> 00:56:19.924
MARISHA: You can tell a low level one person goes
(groaning) and makes flame, but nothing really

00:56:19.924 --> 00:56:21.306
comes out.

00:56:21.306 --> 00:56:28.997
MATT: I throw the cloak back over my shoulder,
take one of the fire sticks. Bidet! And start

00:56:28.997 --> 00:56:31.502
heading in the direction of the Sun Kissed
Tavern.

00:56:31.502 --> 00:56:33.562
MARISHA: (yelling) She screams and runs off.

00:56:33.562 --> 00:56:35.769
MATT: Do I have to move a point anywhere for
that?

00:56:35.769 --> 00:56:41.222
MARISHA: That was a successful criminal action, so
point from bear to criminal.

00:56:41.222 --> 00:56:43.615
TALIESIN: Good grabbing the stick.

00:56:43.615 --> 00:56:45.831
MATT: I'm holding the flame stick with me now.

00:56:45.831 --> 00:56:53.947
MARISHA: You see Pike, off in the distance, start
looking and moving people out of the way.

00:56:53.947 --> 00:56:55.583
MATT: I get as low as I can.

00:56:55.583 --> 00:57:01.833
MARISHA: "What do you mean, a bear? What did the
bear look like?" She is demanding from other

00:57:01.833 --> 00:57:08.806
people that are screaming in panic right now. You've
successfully wreaked havoc. You hear a few guards

00:57:08.806 --> 00:57:21.560
call out, "Those bears got in the city! Damn it,
O'Donnell!" Keep moving. The rest of you bears,

00:57:21.560 --> 00:57:29.126
you sneak off, go around, heading your way towards
the tavern.

00:57:29.126 --> 00:57:30.519
LIAM: You got a bead on it?

00:57:30.519 --> 00:57:32.701
TALIESIN: Yeah. I think I can hack it.

00:57:32.701 --> 00:57:36.958
LIAM: We're going to stick to the alleyways, we're
going to make our way there quietly. All right?

00:57:36.958 --> 00:57:38.184
TALIESIN: Quiet.

00:57:38.184 --> 00:57:39.531
LIAM: Little guy?

00:57:39.531 --> 00:57:40.606
BRIAN: Huh?

00:57:40.606 --> 00:57:41.447
LIAM: Vegas.

00:57:41.447 --> 00:57:42.303
BRIAN: Yeah!

00:57:42.303 --> 00:57:43.273
LIAM: Take point!

00:57:43.273 --> 00:57:44.834
BRIAN: How many?

00:57:44.834 --> 00:57:46.907
LIAM: 15 HB.

00:57:46.907 --> 00:57:49.688
BRIAN: Okay. What else?

00:57:49.688 --> 00:57:54.724
LIAM: Just get ahead of us, look around the corner,
see if anybody's coming. If there's anybody there--

00:57:54.724 --> 00:57:56.291
BRIAN: Kill them immediately.

00:57:56.291 --> 00:57:59.490
LIAM: You're two feet tall; don't kill them
immediately, just give us a signal!

00:57:59.490 --> 00:58:02.074
BRIAN: And then they get on the ground, and then I
go at the neck.

00:58:02.074 --> 00:58:07.954
LIAM: It's a good thing you're a good at pulling
thorns out of our paws, I'm telling you, Vegas.

00:58:07.954 --> 00:58:10.636
BRIAN: Suck poison out, too, if I really needed
to.

00:58:10.636 --> 00:58:12.368
LIAM: Get up there, earn your fucking keep.

00:58:12.368 --> 00:58:15.657
BRIAN: Okay! I run over and crawl down to the
thing.

00:58:15.657 --> 00:58:18.110
TALIESIN: Damn honey badger don't need any lip.

00:58:18.110 --> 00:58:19.825
BRIAN: Eh, shut up.

00:58:19.825 --> 00:58:29.918
MARISHA: Peek around a corner, look left, look
right. You see a discarded wheelbarrow, a few

00:58:29.918 --> 00:58:34.373
discarded carts, some trash.

00:58:34.373 --> 00:58:41.260
BRIAN: I want a cart. I'm the HB Driver.

00:58:41.260 --> 00:58:48.149
MARISHA: You veer off, you take a closer look. One's
a little pull-behind cart that has shoulder

00:58:48.149 --> 00:58:54.928
straps. It'd be one of the bigger ones.
There's a wheelbarrow. Looks tinier, made of wood,

00:58:54.967 --> 00:59:02.745
but you might be able to maneuver it. It looks
like a little kid wagon, is basically what it is.

00:59:02.745 --> 00:59:04.230
SAM: Vegas, what you got up there?

00:59:04.230 --> 00:59:06.818
BRIAN: I'm looking for one that looks like the
A-Team van!

00:59:06.818 --> 00:59:13.137
SAM: I don't know what that-- no! I'm not from
around here. I'm an out-of-towner.

00:59:13.137 --> 00:59:14.591
LIAM: Bee-Team, come on!

00:59:14.591 --> 00:59:16.621
BRIAN: There's some carts and a wheelbarrow!

00:59:16.621 --> 00:59:18.227
SAM: A cart?

00:59:18.227 --> 00:59:19.237
BRIAN: Yeah!

00:59:19.237 --> 00:59:20.896
SAM: I can lift a cart.

00:59:20.896 --> 00:59:23.344
BRIAN: Okay. Take the cart.

00:59:23.344 --> 00:59:31.146
MARISHA: You push on the cart a little bit. Wheel
falls off and collapses. Looks like it's been

00:59:31.146 --> 00:59:41.998
there for a while. As it collapses, behind that is
a shiny, chrome metallic, little black detailing

00:59:41.998 --> 00:59:48.418
racing stripes on the side-- It's like a little
Radio Flyer wagon.

00:59:48.418 --> 00:59:50.956
LIAM: Does it say de Rolo on it?

00:59:50.956 --> 00:59:55.515
MARISHA: It, in fact, does say de Rolo on it.

00:59:55.515 --> 01:00:06.393
BRIAN: Okay, so there's some really shiny shit
here. I'm going to use extreme caution bringing it

01:00:06.393 --> 01:00:11.749
down the hallway. I'm going to move all the shit
out of the way and pull it down.

01:00:11.749 --> 01:00:15.261
TALIESIN: Vegas, are you sure you can maneuver
this thing? You seen something like this before?

01:00:15.261 --> 01:00:18.764
MARISHA: Roll a criminal check as you're trying to
be stealthy.

01:00:18.764 --> 01:00:20.401
TALIESIN: This thing looks complicated.

01:00:20.401 --> 01:00:22.778
LIAM and BRIAN: How big is it?

01:00:22.778 --> 01:00:24.134
TALIESIN: Bigger than a honeypot?

01:00:24.134 --> 01:00:28.654
MARISHA: It's bigger than a honeypot. It's a Radio
Flyer, it's a little wagon!

01:00:28.654 --> 01:00:30.850
LIAM: So it's big enough for Vegas, but not for a
bunch of bears.

01:00:30.850 --> 01:00:31.816
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:00:31.816 --> 01:00:32.974
BRIAN: Success.

01:00:32.974 --> 01:00:40.965
MARISHA: Success? You shift some things aside. You
hear a rustle from the house. Don't move for a

01:00:40.965 --> 01:00:46.508
second. "George! George!"

01:00:46.508 --> 01:00:49.147
BRIAN: Who the fuck's George? Do we know who
George is?

01:00:49.147 --> 01:00:54.750
MARISHA: "Goddamn my piece of shit husband." She
wanders off. You can continue.

01:00:54.750 --> 01:00:56.442
BRIAN: (low scraping).

01:00:56.442 --> 01:00:59.601
MARISHA: (squeaking) Liam Las Vegas comes back.

01:00:59.601 --> 01:01:02.050
BRIAN: Guys, look! Behold!

01:01:02.050 --> 01:01:04.693
SAM: What we do with that?

01:01:04.693 --> 01:01:13.886
BRIAN: We can put honey in it! And if someone
gets injured, we could--

01:01:13.886 --> 01:01:15.639
SAM: What?

01:01:15.639 --> 01:01:19.409
BRIAN: Put their honey in it so they can focus
on walking!

01:01:19.409 --> 01:01:21.375
SAM: That's really smart!

01:01:21.375 --> 01:01:24.293
TALIESIN: I put my honey in the wagon.

01:01:24.293 --> 01:01:26.284
LIAM: Yeah, smart.

01:01:26.284 --> 01:01:29.222
TALIESIN: Yeah, that really frees me up. Good
thinking.

01:01:29.222 --> 01:01:33.734
MARISHA: You're all stealthing, keep moving down the
alleyways.

01:01:33.734 --> 01:01:35.711
TALIESIN: The wagon with a fez full of honey.

01:01:35.711 --> 01:01:38.343
SAM: I'm looking for anything that looks like
bamboo.

01:01:38.343 --> 01:01:48.616
MARISHA: You're eating the trash along the way.
There's a few foliage and trees that look

01:01:48.616 --> 01:01:49.578
bamboo-y.

01:01:49.578 --> 01:01:50.610
SAM: I'll eat them!

01:01:50.610 --> 01:01:57.844
MARISHA: There's a few cattail rods and fronds
that are not too bad.

01:01:57.844 --> 01:02:00.761
LIAM: We don't have the city bear back yet,
right?

01:02:00.761 --> 01:02:06.203
MARISHA: Not yet. Actually, about this time, as
you guys come around the corner you run, coming

01:02:06.203 --> 01:02:09.160
down the alleyway, right into Trinket.

01:02:09.160 --> 01:02:10.358
LIAM: What's up, big guy?

01:02:10.358 --> 01:02:12.489
SAM: What happened? There was a lot of commotion
back there!

01:02:12.489 --> 01:02:16.505
MATT: Don't worry about it. We need to get to
the tavern. I look down and see the fez in the

01:02:16.505 --> 01:02:20.013
cart and I hold the fire rod away.

01:02:20.013 --> 01:02:22.865
SAM and BRIAN: What's wrong?

01:02:22.865 --> 01:02:26.654
MATT: Safety tip: this doesn't touch that.

01:02:26.654 --> 01:02:28.897
TALIESIN: That's an important safety tip.

01:02:28.897 --> 01:02:30.925
SAM: Get that thing away from me; I don't like
fire.

01:02:30.925 --> 01:02:36.735
TALIESIN: He's wearing a fez, too, you don't want
to get that anywhere near that. It's very

01:02:36.735 --> 01:02:38.208
flammable.

01:02:38.208 --> 01:02:41.176
MATT: I point again and say, this also doesn't
touch that.

01:02:41.176 --> 01:02:42.521
SAM: What?

01:02:42.521 --> 01:02:44.163
LIAM: Well, I don't like to burn.

01:02:44.163 --> 01:02:46.338
MATT: Remember that chicken?

01:02:46.338 --> 01:02:51.656
LIAM: Uh-huh. What, are you saying there's a
correlation?

01:02:51.656 --> 01:02:52.749
BRIAN: You ate the--

01:02:52.749 --> 01:02:56.769
MATT: Don't worry about it. Sun Kissed Tavern.
Keep leading us on with that beautiful nose of yours.

01:02:56.769 --> 01:02:59.567
TALIESIN: Here's a question: How do you spell Sun
Kissed? And I can't read.

01:02:59.567 --> 01:03:03.344
MATT: Shit.

01:03:03.344 --> 01:03:09.082
SAM: Let's keep following the smell.

01:03:09.082 --> 01:03:11.491
MATT: Maybe it's got pictures.

01:03:11.491 --> 01:03:16.904
MARISHA: Out of one of the side alleys, as you
guys are having this conversation, you hear

01:03:16.904 --> 01:03:23.776
(clopping). See that, I'm fucking Dee Bradley
Baker up in here.

01:03:23.776 --> 01:03:30.742
SAM: Did you just self Dee Bradley Baker
yourself?!

01:03:30.742 --> 01:03:38.908
MARISHA: Yeah, I did! I didn't plan those, I
didn't practice those ahead of time. It's not too bad.

01:03:38.908 --> 01:03:41.081
LIAM: That's a joke for 83 people.

01:03:41.081 --> 01:03:47.370
TALIESIN: I don't feel good about that.

01:03:47.370 --> 01:03:54.844
BRIAN: That was up there with all of Dee Bradley
Baker's monsters for sure.

01:03:54.844 --> 01:03:56.051
MARISHA: Totally!

01:03:56.051 --> 01:03:59.129
LIAM: I give that joke five bear claws out of
five. Very nice!

01:03:59.129 --> 01:04:08.447
MARISHA: You see two silhouettes coming out of the
shadows, also wearing hats. One has horns coming

01:04:08.447 --> 01:04:17.893
out of it. Two cows, also trying to pass as
civilians, come up to you and go, "Well, well,

01:04:17.893 --> 01:04:23.755
"well! What do we have here? It looks like we got
ourselves a couple of wise bears!" They're holding

01:04:23.755 --> 01:04:28.383
a stick like it's a tommy gun, but it's definitely
a stick.

01:04:28.383 --> 01:04:31.350
TALIESIN: Careful kids, they've got sticks.

01:04:31.350 --> 01:04:36.495
LIAM: Hey, friend. Let me ask you something. Are
you one of those cow-cows or one of those

01:04:36.495 --> 01:04:40.329
people-passing-themselves-off-as-cows? Just to
avoid confusion.

01:04:40.329 --> 01:04:47.507
MARISHA: "Look, wise guy. I'm a prize cow. Do you
know who we are? We're the blue ribbon winners

01:04:47.507 --> 01:04:53.695
"here at the Hazel Festival. Yeah, that's right.
And you know what? Me, oh, this here is Bonnie."

01:04:53.695 --> 01:05:07.538
She goes, "Hi! You tell them, Cow!" He goes,
"That's Bonnie and I'm Cow. We're tired of living

01:05:07.538 --> 01:05:11.236
like second-class livestock, you hear?"

01:05:11.236 --> 01:05:14.852
SAM: Point of clarification: They're holding
sticks?

01:05:14.852 --> 01:05:18.429
MARISHA: They're holding sticks. Like tommy guns.

01:05:18.429 --> 01:05:21.952
SAM: Yeah!

01:05:21.952 --> 01:05:25.338
BRIAN: I'm pulling a Radio Flyer!

01:05:25.338 --> 01:05:27.480
SAM: You have digits!

01:05:27.480 --> 01:05:33.597
BRIAN: I do, but still. Cows can carry things.

01:05:33.597 --> 01:05:37.018
MARISHA: It's balanced. It's tucked up under.

01:05:37.018 --> 01:05:39.626
TALIESIN: It's a Far Side cartoon, just go with
it.

01:05:39.626 --> 01:05:45.821
LIAM: Beefcake! I don't think we have a problem
here. There's not a lot of overlap: you guys like

01:05:45.821 --> 01:05:48.252
grass, you guys like ribbons.

01:05:48.252 --> 01:05:52.368
MARISHA: "Oh, do we? Do we like grass? Are you
going to start telling me about myself now? Look

01:05:52.368 --> 01:05:55.778
"at these guys, Bonnie." "Yeah, you tell them,
Cow!" "Yeah!"

01:05:55.778 --> 01:05:57.907
BRIAN: You also like to be milked.

01:05:57.907 --> 01:06:03.049
MARISHA: "All right, you know what? You bears, you
get to enjoy your honey. You get to enjoy all

01:06:03.049 --> 01:06:10.763
"these fruits and all these bamboos. And we get
stuck with hay. And I'm just here to say we're tired of

01:06:10.763 --> 01:06:13.494
"it! Aren't we, Bonnie?" "Yeah!"

01:06:13.494 --> 01:06:19.521
SAM: I step forward and crack my bear knuckles and
say: If you're so sick and tired of it, why don't

01:06:19.521 --> 01:06:23.881
you make a move? Come on, let's end this right
here. Let's settle it.

01:06:23.881 --> 01:06:25.702
BRIAN: Take a shit on them, Peddy!

01:06:25.702 --> 01:06:29.035
SAM: I don't shit where I eat!

01:06:29.035 --> 01:06:32.263
BRIAN: Well, then shit on the one you're not going
to eat!

01:06:32.263 --> 01:06:33.928
SAM: Okay! That makes more sense!

01:06:33.928 --> 01:06:39.505
MARISHA: "Is that a threat? Is that supposed to be
some sort of hamburger threat? I get it! I'm a

01:06:39.505 --> 01:06:44.525
"cow, I've heard them all! All right. You want to
throw down? That honey's ours. All right, let's

01:06:44.525 --> 01:06:45.508
"throw down!"

01:06:45.508 --> 01:06:46.762
SAM: Let's do this!

01:06:46.762 --> 01:06:48.772
TALIESIN: Did the cow just drop his stick?

01:06:48.772 --> 01:06:51.328
MARISHA: He did!

01:06:51.328 --> 01:06:56.640
MATT: Here's my question. How much like bamboo do
those sticks look?

01:06:56.640 --> 01:07:04.531
MARISHA: They look pretty good. They look like
some pretty tasty-looking sticks. They're still

01:07:04.531 --> 01:07:06.699
green. He dropped it on the floor.

01:07:06.699 --> 01:07:08.972
MATT: I lean over to Peddy and say: Disarm them.

01:07:08.972 --> 01:07:12.525
SAM: I pounce with panda speed!

01:07:12.525 --> 01:07:14.131
BRIAN: Yes!

01:07:14.131 --> 01:07:20.635
SAM: I throw myself on the stick and I bite it in
half!

01:07:20.685 --> 01:07:22.760
LIAM: Fuck 'em up, Peddy!

01:07:22.807 --> 01:07:25.270
MARISHA: As you bite down on the stick--

01:07:25.270 --> 01:07:27.514
BRIAN: Gnaw on that knob, Peddy!

01:07:27.514 --> 01:07:33.452
MARISHA: --you realize there's actually something
a little bit different about this stick. It has a

01:07:33.452 --> 01:07:41.026
shimmer to it, it's not as easy to bite through.
You realize this is actually a magic stick.

01:07:41.026 --> 01:07:51.258
SAM: What?! Is this true?!

01:07:51.258 --> 01:07:53.161
MARISHA: Yeah!

01:07:53.161 --> 01:07:55.324
SAM: Like, now?

01:07:55.324 --> 01:07:58.348
MARISHA: You can certainly try.

01:07:58.348 --> 01:08:00.000
SAM: This is a spell I can do?

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:10.698
MARISHA: It's a stick that, when you use it, it
turns into a giant whacking trunk. Yeah.

01:08:10.698 --> 01:08:18.286
SAM: Wait, that's this, yeah? When I use this
stick, I become two bears?

01:08:18.286 --> 01:08:25.678
MARISHA: No. Wait, what? Oh, I gave you the wrong
one! That's what you needed.

01:08:25.678 --> 01:08:40.009
SAM: This makes much more sense! But I don't have
to use it now, but have this item.

01:08:40.009 --> 01:08:41.329
MARISHA: You now have it.

01:08:41.329 --> 01:08:48.567
SAM: Okay, great. I can't bite it in half! I'll
just hold onto it with my digits that I have.

01:08:48.567 --> 01:08:56.147
MARISHA: Bonnie and Cow go, "Moo!" and start
trying to stampede you all. What do you do?

01:08:56.147 --> 01:09:03.806
TALIESIN: I take off my cloak and I'm going to try
and bull them out into one of the buildings.

01:09:03.806 --> 01:09:05.313
MARISHA: Roll for criminal.

01:09:05.313 --> 01:09:06.516
TALIESIN: This is all criminal.

01:09:06.516 --> 01:09:10.898
MARISHA: Roll for being a cow hacker. You're cow
hacking.

01:09:10.898 --> 01:09:15.441
TALIESIN: Bovine hacking. Classic. I rolled a
four, I do not hack.

01:09:15.441 --> 01:09:22.052
MARISHA: He doesn't fall for it. He tramples right
over you. You get knocked prone on the ground. You

01:09:22.052 --> 01:09:24.280
get aggravated and take a point in bear.

01:09:24.280 --> 01:09:28.820
LIAM: I'm going to grab Las Vegas by the scruff of
the neck off the Radio Flyer and I'm going to try

01:09:28.820 --> 01:09:31.201
to chuck him on top of Cow.

01:09:31.201 --> 01:09:32.351
MARISHA: All right!

01:09:32.351 --> 01:09:34.860
BRIAN: I'll get on there and I'll start going
carnage, yeah.

01:09:34.860 --> 01:09:41.327
MARISHA: Do fastball special, land on top of him,
get a nice little foam going in the mouth. It's

01:09:41.327 --> 01:09:43.369
good. Roll 2d6.

01:09:43.369 --> 01:09:45.541
LIAM: You're the driver; steer that shit!

01:09:45.541 --> 01:09:48.298
BRIAN: One and two!

01:09:48.298 --> 01:09:55.601
MARISHA: You start tearing at the throat of Cow.
Poor Cow didn't know what was coming to him.

01:09:55.601 --> 01:09:57.013
Scruff is getting--

01:09:57.013 --> 01:09:58.494
BRIAN: Eat more chicken!

01:09:58.494 --> 01:10:05.793
MARISHA: He goes down pretty good. Bonnie turns
and goes, "What?! No! You monsters!" and she turns

01:10:05.793 --> 01:10:07.946
and goes for you, Trinket.

01:10:07.946 --> 01:10:17.696
MATT: As she rears towards me, I get down and be
as imposing a grizzly figure as I can, and give a

01:10:17.696 --> 01:10:23.418
very focused, centered roar right in her
direction. (roars)

01:10:23.418 --> 01:10:25.425
MARISHA: Roll for terrify.

01:10:25.425 --> 01:10:30.798
MATT: Yeah, with a two. I only have two bear right
now.

01:10:30.798 --> 01:10:36.046
MARISHA: She goes, "You'll pay for this."

01:10:36.046 --> 01:10:40.375
MATT: Take your wounded boy, and don't cross a
bear in a hat ever again.

01:10:40.375 --> 01:10:48.155
MARISHA: She grabs Cow and starts trying to drag
him off. It's going to take time.

01:10:48.155 --> 01:10:49.562
SAM: It's going to take a while.

01:10:49.562 --> 01:10:52.822
MARISHA: It's pretty sad, actually.

01:10:52.822 --> 01:10:54.359
BRIAN: Are there any sticks left?

01:10:54.359 --> 01:10:58.796
MARISHA: Just the one stick. There is another
stick. It is just a stick, though.

01:10:58.796 --> 01:11:01.468
SAM: I'm going to eat the second stick.

01:11:01.468 --> 01:11:11.132
MARISHA: Okay. I'd say you get a point in bear for
that. You did some pretty good bear stuff this

01:11:11.132 --> 01:11:12.371
go-round.

01:11:12.371 --> 01:11:14.242
MATT: Do we also move a point into bear?

01:11:14.242 --> 01:11:19.842
MARISHA: You would move a point into criminal, and
you would also move a point into criminal because

01:11:19.842 --> 01:11:21.141
your plan succeeded.

01:11:21.141 --> 01:11:23.423
MATT: For using a special skill. That's right.
That's not good.

01:11:23.423 --> 01:11:28.199
TALIESIN: Say, Trinket. You've got a great singing
voice.

01:11:28.199 --> 01:11:34.883
SAM: Boss, I know she's within earshot, but
shouldn't we leave no witnesses? Do you want me to

01:11:34.883 --> 01:11:37.284
take her out of commission?

01:11:37.284 --> 01:11:41.699
LIAM: She's a fucking cow. Do you think she's
going to go to the city council and report a bunch

01:11:41.699 --> 01:11:46.145
of bears? We need to keep on the task at hand: get
the honey and get out.

01:11:46.145 --> 01:11:51.563
MATT: As she turns away, I take a quick glance to
look at the back of her shoulderblades to see if I

01:11:51.563 --> 01:11:53.857
notice any familiar branding.

01:11:53.857 --> 01:12:04.346
MARISHA: You actually do recognize this branding.
This is from the old couple that Vox Machina saved

01:12:04.346 --> 01:12:07.312
their bears from being eaten from rocs.

01:12:07.312 --> 01:12:08.449
MATT and SAM: Their cows.

01:12:08.449 --> 01:12:10.792
MARISHA: Their cows, yeah. What did I say?

01:12:10.792 --> 01:12:11.792
SAM: You said bears.

01:12:11.792 --> 01:12:14.288
MARISHA: Oh, sorry. Cows.

01:12:14.288 --> 01:12:15.485
LIAM: We got it.

01:12:15.485 --> 01:12:19.651
MARISHA: The same old couple that you saw earlier,
running through looking for their lost cows.

01:12:19.651 --> 01:12:24.869
MATT: I turn to Peddy and say: wait, I know these
cows. We've talked to these cows. These cows are

01:12:24.869 --> 01:12:26.240
assholes.

01:12:26.240 --> 01:12:28.238
SAM: You want me to show them what-for?

01:12:28.238 --> 01:12:29.738
MATT: Finish them off.

01:12:29.738 --> 01:12:33.163
SAM: All right! I'm going to go up and take my
stick and knock Bonnie in the head with it.

01:12:33.163 --> 01:12:44.034
MARISHA: Okay, you use the stick, and as you rear
it back, it turns into a giant tree trunk,

01:12:44.034 --> 01:12:48.970
basically, that comes toppling down right on her
head. Roll for criminal.

01:12:48.970 --> 01:12:53.397
SAM: Oh, I've got to roll well. Two!

01:12:53.397 --> 01:12:55.178
MARISHA: Wait, no. Bear.

01:12:55.178 --> 01:12:56.506
SAM: Either way, I succeed.

01:12:56.506 --> 01:13:01.237
MARISHA: Okay. (impact) A little blood
splatters--

01:13:01.237 --> 01:13:02.336
SAM: She's dead?

01:13:02.336 --> 01:13:09.086
MARISHA: She had a tree fall on her. And then
after a second, it goes back to a stick.

01:13:09.086 --> 01:13:12.339
MATT: Okay, I thought it was a stick. That's on
me.

01:13:12.339 --> 01:13:16.766
SAM: This is amazing! I've got a stick that makes
trees.

01:13:16.766 --> 01:13:19.819
TALIESIN: Who would've thunk it.

01:13:19.819 --> 01:13:21.926
LIAM: Trinket, I'm going to make a proposal to
you.

01:13:21.926 --> 01:13:23.828
MATT: Does it involve honey? I'm starting to get real
twitchy.

01:13:23.828 --> 01:13:24.667
SAM: Boss!

01:13:24.667 --> 01:13:25.782
LIAM: Yeah?

01:13:25.782 --> 01:13:28.902
SAM: Did you hear the part where this turns into
trees?!

01:13:28.902 --> 01:13:32.884
LIAM: It doesn't make any sense. I'm doing
business, all right? Sit tight.

01:13:32.884 --> 01:13:35.465
SAM: I feel like this is a more momentous thing!

01:13:35.465 --> 01:13:39.930
LIAM: It doesn't seem that important in the grand
scheme of things.

01:13:39.930 --> 01:13:42.766
BRIAN: Didn't it used to be a tree, anyway?

01:13:42.766 --> 01:13:45.885
LIAM: Keep your mind on honey, all right, Peddy?

01:13:45.885 --> 01:13:46.797
SAM: All right.

01:13:46.797 --> 01:13:51.857
BRIAN: I know you're not used to holding things
that size in your hand, but you need to focus.

01:13:51.857 --> 01:13:53.017
LIAM: Las Vegas.

01:13:53.017 --> 01:13:54.076
BRIAN: Yo.

01:13:54.076 --> 01:13:57.701
LIAM: You're the best at what you do, bud, but
hold on. The big bears are talking business.

01:13:57.701 --> 01:13:58.872
BRIAN: All right.

01:13:58.872 --> 01:14:05.656
LIAM: You seem like a hard motherfucker to me.
Once we get the honey, I get the sense that you've

01:14:05.656 --> 01:14:08.214
got ties to these people.

01:14:08.214 --> 01:14:10.143
MATT: More or less, yeah.

01:14:10.143 --> 01:14:18.837
LIAM: What say you run free with us? We could hit
Vasselheim. We could get all the fucking honey of every

01:14:18.837 --> 01:14:22.906
temple in that city. The good stuff, after this.

01:14:22.906 --> 01:14:25.009
BRIAN: We've got a cart to pull it in, and
everything.

01:14:25.009 --> 01:14:29.911
TALIESIN: The Slayer's Take's got to have fingers
in dozens of bakeries all over town. Their honey

01:14:29.911 --> 01:14:33.662
pots are sweet.

01:14:33.662 --> 01:14:40.582
MATT: Looking as how I'm five points into criminal
right now, I start nodding slowly, and go: all

01:14:40.582 --> 01:14:47.595
right, I hear what you're saying. You all seem to
be a fairly functional lot. We'll see how this--

01:14:47.595 --> 01:14:54.519
&lt;i&gt;most&lt;/i&gt; of you seem like a functional lot. Let's
see how this goes down. When all's said and done

01:14:54.519 --> 01:14:58.523
and we've enjoyed our just desserts, you might be
onto something.

01:14:58.523 --> 01:15:01.192
LIAM: I like this guy, Waffle.

01:15:01.192 --> 01:15:05.043
TALIESIN: Yeah, there was a honey pun. That's
good. Yeah.

01:15:05.043 --> 01:15:15.194
MARISHA: You peek down the alleyway a little bit.
People are still pretty cleared out of the town

01:15:15.194 --> 01:15:21.947
square from where everyone was looking for a giant
bear that's now running loose in the town. You see

01:15:21.947 --> 01:15:31.126
a few knocked-over jars of the sample honey. It
would be risky, but there's some honey not too far.

01:15:31.126 --> 01:15:37.298
MATT: That's worth the risk. I've got to keep my
eyes focused. My brain right now is caught up with

01:15:37.298 --> 01:15:42.066
the ideas of all the various other heists we could
throw, and I've been a good person so far, a good

01:15:42.066 --> 01:15:49.305
bear, in my life. I can't deter too far from that
path. I'll be right back. And I rush up to try and

01:15:49.305 --> 01:15:51.306
grab one of the canisters and bring it back.

01:15:51.306 --> 01:15:52.881
SAM: Why's he always leaving us like that?

01:15:52.881 --> 01:15:54.045
MARISHA: Roll for criminal.

01:15:54.045 --> 01:15:56.298
MATT: I make it.

01:15:56.298 --> 01:16:00.433
MARISHA: You scoop up as many as you can.

01:16:00.433 --> 01:16:02.285
MATT: I'm jamming it into my mouth directly.

01:16:02.285 --> 01:16:16.791
MARISHA: Move a point from criminal to bear, and
I'd say you can probably bear-handle two more jars

01:16:16.791 --> 01:16:18.592
of honey, awkwardly.

01:16:18.592 --> 01:16:21.583
MATT: I come back and put it into the Radio Flyer.

01:16:21.583 --> 01:16:24.999
BRIAN: Can I eat some of it as I help him?

01:16:24.999 --> 01:16:28.290
MARISHA: Sure. Move a point. Does anyone else want to
eat anything? You good?

01:16:28.290 --> 01:16:33.579
LIAM: I'm all right. I'm feeling pretty in
control, so let those in need scoop the honey first.

01:16:33.579 --> 01:16:36.260
SAM: I'm more of a bamboo person, honestly. I
don't really-- I'm fine.

01:16:36.260 --> 01:16:37.680
MATT: Dip your spoon in it. Try it.

01:16:37.680 --> 01:16:52.947
SAM: Oh yeah, I have those sample spoons.
Delicate. Nice odor. Has a forward nose. Jammy,

01:16:52.947 --> 01:16:54.797
but new-world jammy.

01:16:54.797 --> 01:16:57.083
BRIAN: Jammy? I heard jimmy.

01:16:57.083 --> 01:17:00.148
SAM: Yeah, it's got a steely-oaky feel.

01:17:00.148 --> 01:17:02.196
TALIESIN: What are the notes, man?

01:17:02.196 --> 01:17:03.973
BRIAN: How old would you say it is?

01:17:03.973 --> 01:17:14.468
SAM: 12 years, aged in barrel. Good mouthfeel. I
like it! Hey, this stuff is pretty good. You know

01:17:14.468 --> 01:17:17.391
what this is like? Liquid bamboo.

01:17:17.391 --> 01:17:22.733
LIAM: You know how you can tell a panda bear is a
vegan? It never fucking stops telling you about it.

01:17:22.733 --> 01:17:27.241
BRIAN: Yeah, and the ones that do Crossfit.

01:17:27.241 --> 01:17:31.731
(laughter)

01:17:31.731 --> 01:17:33.403
SAM: What's Crossfit?

01:17:33.403 --> 01:17:37.521
BRIAN: It's when they run up and down the thing,
and they're always talking about the shirts.

01:17:37.521 --> 01:17:41.033
LIAM: No, Vegas, we do Bee-90X.

01:17:41.033 --> 01:17:43.465
BRIAN: Yeah, Bee-90X.

01:17:43.465 --> 01:17:51.025
MATT: Focus! We've got honey hiding somewhere
right now. I don't want you buffoons ruining our

01:17:51.025 --> 01:17:55.184
chance. They know there's bears around now, and I
bought us a little bit of time, but we've got to

01:17:55.184 --> 01:17:56.255
hurry it up.

01:17:56.255 --> 01:17:59.870
LIAM: He talks a lot of sense. Come on. We've got
to keep our eyes on the prize. We've got to get to

01:17:59.870 --> 01:18:00.956
this inn.

01:18:00.956 --> 01:18:02.610
MATT: All right. You've got the nose, you've got
the brains.

01:18:02.610 --> 01:18:04.507
LIAM: You got a scent on it, Waffle?

01:18:04.507 --> 01:18:06.036
TALIESIN: Do I still got a scent on it?

01:18:06.036 --> 01:18:08.402
MARISHA: Yeah, I'd say you've still got a pretty
good scent on it.

01:18:08.402 --> 01:18:14.477
TALIESIN: Yeah, it's this way. Bring the cart
around!

01:18:14.477 --> 01:18:23.430
BRIAN: (squeaking wheels)

01:18:23.430 --> 01:18:31.667
MARISHA: You hear a few guards in the distance,
shouting. It's kind of inaudible. "Clear!" Seems

01:18:31.711 --> 01:18:34.027
people are definitely looking.

01:18:34.027 --> 01:18:36.198
LIAM: Snake? Snake!

01:18:36.198 --> 01:18:46.417
MARISAH: You've definitely put the city on high
alert, for sure. Everyone roll a criminal check as

01:18:46.417 --> 01:18:48.827
you stealthily move through the city.

01:18:48.827 --> 01:18:50.782
SAM: Succeed.

01:18:50.782 --> 01:18:52.402
MATT and BRIAN: Succeed.

01:18:52.402 --> 01:18:55.696
LIAM: I failed big time. I rolled a six.

01:18:55.696 --> 01:18:57.505
MARISHA: All right. What about you, Waffle?

01:18:57.505 --> 01:19:00.280
TALIESIN: I was going to roll, but first, I was
going to think about the last time we were in a

01:19:00.280 --> 01:19:01.990
tricky situation like this.

01:19:01.990 --> 01:19:04.623
BRIAN: Ugh, here comes one of grandpa's old
stories.

01:19:04.623 --> 01:19:10.752
TALIESIN: No, I remember we were doing a roll
through Whitestone. There was high alert.

01:19:10.752 --> 01:19:13.437
MARISHA: Flashback! (flashback noises)

01:19:13.437 --> 01:19:17.915
TALIESIN: We were trying to book our way through
the main square towards that big tree.

01:19:17.915 --> 01:19:19.112
LIAM: Goddamn tree.

01:19:19.112 --> 01:19:23.730
TALIESIN: The tree can give you a little coverage,
but not nearly enough. That cart came by, and we kept

01:19:23.730 --> 01:19:29.271
walking right behind the horses on the cart. No
one suspected a thing. They were sitting there,

01:19:29.271 --> 01:19:34.758
minding their own business, making noise like,
"Bears! Look out, bears!" They didn't see a damn

01:19:34.758 --> 01:19:36.106
thing coming.

01:19:36.106 --> 01:19:39.474
LIAM: Farted the whole way there. Smokescreen.
Done. Out. Honey got.

01:19:39.474 --> 01:19:43.400
TALIESIN: Ba-da-bing. Can I get a point of
criminal?

01:19:43.400 --> 01:19:45.187
MARISHA: You can get a point in criminal back.

01:19:45.187 --> 01:19:47.125
LIAM: Does that save all of us, or just him?

01:19:47.125 --> 01:19:53.777
MARISHA: Just him. I'd say, if you want to switch
a point, since you were part of that, go ahead.

01:19:53.777 --> 01:19:55.107
LIAM: So it goes...

01:19:55.107 --> 01:19:58.090
MARISHA: From bear to criminal.

01:19:58.090 --> 01:20:03.405
TALIESIN: Flashback, you go bear to criminal.
Honey: criminal to bear. Don't know why I'm

01:20:03.405 --> 01:20:04.794
still-- boy.

01:20:04.794 --> 01:20:12.673
MARISHA: And it actually gives you a pretty good
idea, Waffle. Since the town is kind of empty

01:20:12.673 --> 01:20:18.936
right now, you walk by a little news stand that
has tobacco and hand-rolled cigarettes.

01:20:18.936 --> 01:20:28.668
TALIESIN: Sweet syrup, I got me an idea. Hold on. I
walk up. Just trying.

01:20:28.668 --> 01:20:31.347
MARISHA: Okay.

01:20:31.347 --> 01:20:37.811
TALIESIN: Pull a cigar together, basically. Trying
to stealthily grab a couple cigars.

01:20:37.811 --> 01:20:43.591
MARISHA: Okay. I'll allow it to just happen. Just
because of the ridiculousness.

01:20:43.591 --> 01:20:46.971
TALIESIN: I'm going to light a couple.

01:20:46.971 --> 01:20:50.362
MATT: I go to get the fire staff from the ground,
pull it back, pull my cloak back up.

01:20:50.362 --> 01:20:53.756
MARISHA: It's an obnoxiously large flame for what
you're trying to do, but--

01:20:53.756 --> 01:20:56.916
TALIESIN: That's fine. It's fine. Now--

01:20:56.916 --> 01:21:02.396
LIAM: Last time you did this, you got stoned for
three days on the outskirts of Kraghammer. I had

01:21:02.396 --> 01:21:05.447
to talk you out of that tree. Took me three
fucking days!

01:21:05.447 --> 01:21:06.828
TALIESIN: But it worked, didn't it?

01:21:06.828 --> 01:21:08.361
LIAM: Do you have yourself in control?

01:21:08.421 --> 01:21:10.326
TALIESIN: I'm fine. Right now I feel (grunts).

01:21:10.326 --> 01:21:11.865
LIAM: Moderation. Moderation.

01:21:11.865 --> 01:21:16.786
TALIESIN: Feeling good. Feeling fine. So... now?

01:21:16.786 --> 01:21:25.266
MARISHA: Go ahead and put another point into
criminal from bear. It's pretty good. It feels

01:21:25.266 --> 01:21:26.398
pretty good.

01:21:26.398 --> 01:21:28.703
TALIESIN: Yeah. No, smoking. Honey blazed.

01:21:28.703 --> 01:21:37.434
MARISHA: You guys keep moving, doing pretty good.
As you come around a corner, down an alleyway, you

01:21:37.434 --> 01:21:47.178
see a little kerfuffle going on and you see two
bigger kids just sucker-punching on this little

01:21:47.178 --> 01:21:52.530
kid and they're taking honey samples and smearing
it in his hand. A lot of it, it's Victor just

01:21:52.530 --> 01:21:59.075
smearing it into his hair. You hear the kid
screaming, "Hey! Hey! Stop it! Stop it, you guys!

01:21:59.075 --> 01:22:02.533
"Seriously, my dad's going to kick your butt!"

01:22:02.533 --> 01:22:06.950
BRIAN: I run over there and smack one of the kids
in the back of the head.

01:22:06.950 --> 01:22:10.354
MARISHA: He was like, (sneering) "Ah!" Turns
around.

01:22:10.354 --> 01:22:12.217
BRIAN: Stop it!

01:22:12.217 --> 01:22:19.043
MARISHA: "Shit, you guys! Hey Jordan. Jordan, look,
it's a ferret! Let's capture him!"

01:22:19.043 --> 01:22:21.385
BRIAN: I'm not a ferret, you piece of shit! Get
away from him!

01:22:21.385 --> 01:22:23.397
MARISHA: The kids start trying to capture you.

01:22:23.397 --> 01:22:25.470
BRIAN: Oh, that's fine. I just start fucking--

01:22:25.470 --> 01:22:26.854
SAM: Killing?

01:22:26.854 --> 01:22:28.082
MARISHA: Roll for carnage.

01:22:28.082 --> 01:22:29.057
BRIAN: Carnage.

01:22:29.057 --> 01:22:30.932
LIAM: I'm going to run out and help him. I'm going
to jump the other kid.

01:22:30.932 --> 01:22:35.145
BRIAN: (shouting) I don't like bullies! It's a
four.

01:22:35.145 --> 01:22:36.518
MATT: Oh, you have advantage because it's
carnage.

01:22:36.518 --> 01:22:38.612
BRIAN: Yeah, then you have advantage.

01:22:38.612 --> 01:22:41.068
MARISHA: Go ahead, roll for bear plus one.

01:22:41.068 --> 01:22:44.933
BRIAN: I fail. Does that mean I fail? Yeah.

01:22:44.933 --> 01:22:46.509
LIAM: I failed hard.

01:22:46.509 --> 01:22:48.169
MARISHA: Oh shit.

01:22:48.169 --> 01:22:49.249
BRIAN: We both failed.

01:22:49.249 --> 01:22:50.541
LIAM: Son of a bitch!

01:22:50.541 --> 01:22:57.163
MARISHA: (laughs) The kid grabs you successfully.
The other kid turns, sees you. He's like, "Oh

01:22:57.163 --> 01:23:02.956
"shit! Shit, Jordan, it's those bears!" And starts
taking the wooden play sword that he got at the

01:23:02.956 --> 01:23:06.613
festival and just starts beating you with it.

01:23:06.613 --> 01:23:09.275
TALIESIN: I'm going to hack that sword in half! I'm
going to come running up and hack that sword in half.

01:23:09.275 --> 01:23:13.002
MARISHA: Take a point in bear. Also take a point
in bear. As the kid's holding you and you're just

01:23:13.002 --> 01:23:15.327
(struggling sounds).

01:23:15.327 --> 01:23:19.698
MATT: I just sit back and watch with Peddy,
smoking the cigarette that Waffle gave me.

01:23:19.698 --> 01:23:21.278
TALIESIN: I'm going to hack that sword in half.

01:23:21.278 --> 01:23:23.059
BRIAN: This is not how it went in the after school
special.

01:23:23.059 --> 01:23:24.593
MARISHA: How are you going to hack that sword?

01:23:24.593 --> 01:23:27.474
TALIESIN: With my claws. I'm going to hack it in
half.

01:23:27.474 --> 01:23:30.515
MARISHA: You're really pushing that hacker thing,
aren't you?

01:23:30.515 --> 01:23:32.924
TALIESIN: That's what you gave me, man!

01:23:32.924 --> 01:23:36.863
MARISHA: You know, once again, I'll allow it based
on the shitty English language.

01:23:36.863 --> 01:23:40.948
TALIESIN: Thank you. That's how I get away with
almost everything in my life.

01:23:40.948 --> 01:23:42.730
MARISHA: Two dice, under bear.

01:23:42.730 --> 01:23:47.170
TALIESIN: Two dice, under bear. I do it! I hack
the sword.

01:23:47.170 --> 01:23:53.412
MARISHA: Okay. The sword breaks in half. He's
like, "Oh, shit, it's the other bear!"

01:23:53.412 --> 01:23:55.394
TALIESIN: You've been hacked.

01:23:55.394 --> 01:23:56.729
MARISHA: "What? I feel like--"

01:23:56.729 --> 01:24:00.488
TALIESIN: Say it! Say you've been hacked! I hacked
you! Say it!

01:24:00.488 --> 01:24:03.018
MARISHA: "George, what's he trying to say?"

01:24:03.018 --> 01:24:05.069
TALIESIN: (bear sounds)

01:24:05.069 --> 01:24:06.671
MARISHA: As he's distracted--

01:24:06.671 --> 01:24:09.216
LIAM: Do I have a kid on my back, by the way?

01:24:09.216 --> 01:24:16.772
MARISHA: Oh, the other kid that was being bullied
comes up with his prop sword and he goes (whack)

01:24:16.772 --> 01:24:22.350
and comes down right over the top of the first kid
who is holding you. He turns to the second kid.

01:24:22.350 --> 01:24:28.409
They're like, "Aw, shit, man. Come on, let's get
out of here!" And they take off.

01:24:28.409 --> 01:24:30.218
LIAM: I trip one of them as they run.

01:24:30.218 --> 01:24:35.094
MARISHA: "Ugh! You just scraped my knee!"
(crying)

01:24:35.094 --> 01:24:39.158
LIAM: Run, you stubborn prick, you! (manic laughter)

01:24:39.158 --> 01:24:40.509
MARISHA: "Mum!"

01:24:40.509 --> 01:24:44.184
SAM: We're dicks.

01:24:44.184 --> 01:24:48.336
MARISHA: As you flick the cigarette, you see one
of Victor's sample cups go--

01:24:48.336 --> 01:24:49.266
MATT: No!

01:24:49.266 --> 01:24:53.241
MARISHA: --(ignition sounds). It goes (sparking
sound), like a bottle rocket.

01:24:53.241 --> 01:24:59.249
MATT: Right. Point of order. No one flick
cigarettes. Especially if there are kids with it smeared in

01:24:59.249 --> 01:25:05.586
their hair. I'm so sorry. Which, the kid sees a
giant hat-wearing Trinket going (bear sounds).

01:25:05.592 --> 01:25:09.463
MARISHA: He's got this cowlick-- he's sore and
he's like--

01:25:09.463 --> 01:25:12.550
MATT: I hold the torch away.

01:25:12.550 --> 01:25:17.347
MARISHA: "Wow. You know, I really feel like you
guys are trying to talk to me. This is great! You

01:25:17.347 --> 01:25:23.130
"guys saved me! Oh, I got saved by bears! No one's
going to believe me."

01:25:23.130 --> 01:25:26.085
MATT: (grunts)

01:25:26.085 --> 01:25:30.392
MARISHA: "That's right, fuzzy bear. Hey, are you
guys-- you guys want some honey?"

01:25:30.392 --> 01:25:31.385
BRIAN: Yes?

01:25:31.385 --> 01:25:32.638
MARISHA: "I know where there's a lot of honey."

01:25:32.638 --> 01:25:34.180
TALIESIN: That's the only word of English I know.

01:25:34.180 --> 01:25:35.115
BRIAN: Tell us.

01:25:35.115 --> 01:25:38.494
MARISHA: "Okay. See, my dad is the head of
security."

01:25:38.494 --> 01:25:40.959
BRIAN: Congrats.

01:25:40.959 --> 01:25:48.797
MARISHA: "He's the head of-- so he knows where all
the honey is hiding and he told me that there's a

01:25:48.797 --> 01:25:56.564
"code and he made me collect a bunch of fish for it
and it wasn't very fun. But there's a secret code!

01:25:56.564 --> 01:26:00.304
"I can tell it. I can show you where my dad is!"

01:26:00.304 --> 01:26:10.638
LIAM: Kid, how would you like to be an official
bear bandit? (bear sounds)

01:26:10.638 --> 01:26:18.168
MARISHA: "It's so cool having bear friends! Okay,
if you go around the corner and go up there, right

01:26:18.168 --> 01:26:26.892
"next to the Sun Kissed Inn. My mum likes drinking
there a lot. If you go over, next to the Sun Kissed

01:26:26.892 --> 01:26:32.629
"Inn, there's an alley behind it and there's a
door that goes up to the side, and that's where

01:26:32.629 --> 01:26:36.033
"the head of security is."

01:26:36.033 --> 01:26:40.040
LIAM: This kid. I like this kid.

01:26:40.040 --> 01:26:41.745
SAM: Boss, you know--

01:26:41.745 --> 01:26:45.190
MARISHA: "Okay. Have fun. Bye!" And he runs off.

01:26:45.190 --> 01:26:47.235
MATT: Kid, wash your hair!

01:26:47.235 --> 01:26:51.015
MARISHA: (giggling) "Mum!" And he runs off.

01:26:51.015 --> 01:26:53.498
SAM: Do you want to rub him out? No witnesses,
right?

01:26:53.498 --> 01:26:56.222
LIAM: No, you had your fun for the day, all
right?

01:26:56.222 --> 01:27:00.889
BRIAN: Did you say rub him out? I have to say no.

01:27:00.889 --> 01:27:02.998
TALIESIN: It got weird.

01:27:02.998 --> 01:27:04.386
SAM: Vegas.

01:27:04.386 --> 01:27:06.809
LIAM: I remember this one time in Las Vegas...

01:27:06.809 --> 01:27:08.365
SAM: Oh, are you doing a flashback right now?

01:27:08.365 --> 01:27:10.322
(laughter)

01:27:10.322 --> 01:27:11.820
TALIESIN: No.

01:27:11.820 --> 01:27:16.425
LIAM: All right. You got the smell of honey in
your nose, and we're going to the Sunkist Inn. We know

01:27:16.425 --> 01:27:23.186
the head of security is up a side stairway.
What the fuck do we do with that?

01:27:23.243 --> 01:27:24.651
TALIESIN: I don't know. You're the brains.

01:27:24.651 --> 01:27:27.503
BRIAN: I don't think we can take the cart up the
stairs.

01:27:27.588 --> 01:27:29.642
MATT: I think we can with the right muscle.

01:27:29.642 --> 01:27:32.413
BRIAN: Oh. Yeah.

01:27:32.413 --> 01:27:33.963
SAM: I can carry a cart.

01:27:33.963 --> 01:27:35.762
BRIAN: A cart full of honey?

01:27:35.762 --> 01:27:37.250
SAM: Sure. Yeah.

01:27:37.250 --> 01:27:40.804
BRIAN: Could you carry me too, like the old days?

01:27:40.804 --> 01:27:42.894
SAM: Why would I-- what?

01:27:42.894 --> 01:27:46.754
BRIAN: Remember when I was hiding behind you in
the beginning?

01:27:46.794 --> 01:27:47.625
SAM: Yeah.

01:27:47.625 --> 01:27:49.118
TALIESIN: (flashback sounds)

01:27:49.118 --> 01:27:50.485
(laughter)

01:27:50.485 --> 01:27:52.705
TALIESIN: Everyone go back to eight minutes 
into the video.

01:27:52.705 --> 01:27:57.068
SAM: Are we going to do a flashback to that
moment?

01:27:57.068 --> 01:27:59.066
MARISHA: If you would like to.

01:27:59.066 --> 01:28:00.382
BRIAN: Yeah!

01:28:00.382 --> 01:28:05.020
SAM: Yeah. There's another guy. There's another
guy here. You said three bears but there's another

01:28:05.020 --> 01:28:08.486
guy. Why don't you come out from behind me there,
friend?

01:28:08.486 --> 01:28:12.070
BRIAN: Hey, it's me! I don't remember what I said.

01:28:12.070 --> 01:28:16.385
MARISHA: Flashback. (flashback sounds) And you're
back.

01:28:16.385 --> 01:28:20.305
TALIESIN: Someday we're all going to look 
back on this and laugh, right there.

01:28:20.305 --> 01:28:22.676
MARISHA: Go ahead and put a point from bear into
criminal.

01:28:22.676 --> 01:28:26.350
SAM: I think you did that wrong, friend. No, it's
bear to criminal.

01:28:26.350 --> 01:28:29.723
BRIAN: I was hoping it was gonna take a thing--

01:28:29.723 --> 01:28:32.011
MARISHA: Well, you can always eat the honey.

01:28:32.011 --> 01:28:33.621
BRIAN: Oh yeah.

01:28:33.621 --> 01:28:36.258
MARISHA: And then you also take a point from bear into
criminal.

01:28:36.258 --> 01:28:37.899
BRIAN: I'll eat some more honey too.

01:28:37.899 --> 01:28:40.500
MARISHA: Okay. Now you can move that point
back.

01:28:40.500 --> 01:28:42.701
MATT: How many more servings of honey do we have
in the cart?

01:28:42.701 --> 01:28:45.484
MARISHA: You've got a jar and a half.

01:28:45.484 --> 01:28:47.467
TALIESIN: Are they eating the hat honey?

01:28:47.508 --> 01:28:49.943
MATT: Is it a half a jar per serving?

01:28:49.943 --> 01:28:51.266
MARISHA: I'd say yeah, three more.

01:28:51.266 --> 01:28:52.423
TALIESIN: Don't eat the hat honey.

01:28:52.423 --> 01:28:56.300
MATT: All right, don't eat the hat honey. We only
got three proper servings left so we have to be

01:28:56.300 --> 01:28:57.161
sparing.

01:28:57.161 --> 01:28:59.960
LIAM: How close are we to this tavern?

01:28:59.960 --> 01:29:01.446
BRIAN: Well, we're going to go get a fuckton more.

01:29:01.446 --> 01:29:03.776
LIAM: Waffle, what does your nose tell you?

01:29:03.776 --> 01:29:10.375
TALIESIN: (sniffs) I don't know. I have no real
perception of distance that is actually capable of

01:29:10.375 --> 01:29:12.265
being communicated to a bunch of other bears.

01:29:12.265 --> 01:29:13.450
MARISHA: It's close.

01:29:13.450 --> 01:29:15.280
LIAM: Is it like three glens or five?

01:29:15.280 --> 01:29:16.687
TALIESIN: It's close. No, it's like two glens
tops.

01:29:16.687 --> 01:29:17.576
LIAM: Two glens over?

01:29:17.576 --> 01:29:18.513
TALIESIN: It's close.

01:29:18.513 --> 01:29:19.737
MARISHA: That sounds accurate.

01:29:19.737 --> 01:29:22.261
TALIESIN: A glen. Maybe half a hill and a dale.

01:29:22.261 --> 01:29:28.354
LIAM: Okay. Well, let's get close. I want your
nose and my nose. I have a pretty good nose. The

01:29:28.354 --> 01:29:32.598
best noses. You'd be surprised! We get outside
that tavern and try to figure out where in that

01:29:32.598 --> 01:29:35.356
building that honey is, it's probably in the
tavern, probably in the basement of the

01:29:35.356 --> 01:29:40.350
tavern, probably in the back in the larder-- but
let's check it out. Come on.

01:29:40.350 --> 01:29:51.143
MARISHA: And with that, we will take a break. As
always, stay tuned for the wonderful Brian

01:29:51.143 --> 01:29:57.644
Foster's codeword so you can win some shit. I
don't know what you're going to win, but you're

01:29:57.644 --> 01:29:59.187
going to win some shit.

01:29:59.187 --> 01:30:01.510
BRIAN: It's going to be a beautiful deck box.

01:30:01.510 --> 01:30:04.124
MARISHA: And we're going to take a break and we'll
be right back, I guess.

01:30:04.124 --> 01:30:05.633
SAM: Woo-hoo! Marisha Ray!

01:30:05.633 --> 01:30:08.985
(cheers and applause)

01:30:08.985 --> 01:48:28.213
[break]

01:48:28.272 --> 01:48:43.242
MARISHA: Welcome back... to Trinket and Peddy
Tuxpin's Honey Heist. We have a winner for Brian's

01:48:43.242 --> 01:48:45.803
wood, which is HawkWinter01.

01:48:45.803 --> 01:48:48.327
MATT and MARISHA: HawkWinter!

01:48:48.327 --> 01:48:49.858
BRIAN: Sounds like a born winner.

01:48:49.858 --> 01:48:52.632
MARISHA: Yeah. Sounds like a Marvel character.

01:48:52.632 --> 01:48:54.089
MATT: We drink to your honor.

01:48:54.089 --> 01:49:04.368
MARISHA: Sponsored by Marvel Puzzle Quest. Got to
catch them all. And then you, Sam, quick catch-up

01:49:04.368 --> 01:49:05.394
announcement?

01:49:05.394 --> 01:49:13.058
SAM: Yeah, so next week, I will be hosting a

01:49:39.990 --> 01:49:43.104

01:49:43.104 --> 01:49:45.942
MATT: I'm so excited.

01:49:45.942 --> 01:49:50.413
TALIESIN: I am genuinely so pleased that all of
this is happening.

01:49:50.475 --> 01:49:53.992
ALL: Be pleased.

01:49:53.992 --> 01:49:57.853
TALIESIN: Yeah, and if you've got time tomorrow
night, we got the confirm that we're going to be singing

01:49:57.853 --> 01:50:02.709
and drinking on Gather Your Party tomorrow night,
so we're going to be having a pub sing. You get to

01:50:02.709 --> 01:50:03.881
hear me sing.

01:50:03.881 --> 01:50:09.621
MATT: Forgot to mention One Night Only on
Saturday. We're doing GM Tips. Me and Satine are

01:50:09.621 --> 01:50:12.874
hosting a GM Tips One Night Only, this Saturday at
8PM, I believe.

01:50:12.874 --> 01:50:18.218
MARISHA: We've got some pretty awesome people who
are going to be on it.

01:50:18.218 --> 01:50:22.435
BRIAN: I told Satine. She's on board.

01:50:22.435 --> 01:50:26.722
LIAM: Some bad breaking news. This just in: Laura
and Travis actually tripped and fell into a giant

01:50:26.722 --> 01:50:29.534
vat of Tim Tams in Australia and were smothered to
death.

01:50:29.534 --> 01:50:32.345
SAM: Oh no. They tried to get out, but Vegemite
was poured on top.

01:50:32.345 --> 01:50:34.571
MATT: They have to slam their way out of there.
It's the only way to do it.

01:50:34.571 --> 01:50:36.253
LIAM: There was no coffee nearby.

01:50:36.253 --> 01:50:43.259
BRIAN: It looks like Travis went mud-wrestling
again, but unfortunately, that's not mud.

01:50:43.259 --> 01:50:48.918
MARISHA: You can donate to Oxfam to help them out.
No.

01:50:48.918 --> 01:50:52.274
MATT: So?

01:50:52.274 --> 01:50:58.252
MARISHA: All right. Criminal bear posse.

01:50:58.252 --> 01:51:01.148
SAM: We're right back in it.

01:51:01.148 --> 01:51:02.494
MARISHA: You're right back in.

01:51:02.494 --> 01:51:03.772
TALIESIN: Our cloaks, our hats...

01:51:03.772 --> 01:51:06.270
MARISHA: Your cloaks, your ascots, your hats.

01:51:06.270 --> 01:51:08.197
LIAM: Our miniature Superman capes.

01:51:08.197 --> 01:51:11.284
MARISHA: Your pull-behind de Rolo Roller.

01:51:11.284 --> 01:51:19.573
MATT: Taking inventory here. Three sources of
honey, an explosive honey hat.

01:51:19.573 --> 01:51:21.531
TALIESIN: A fez of explosive honey.

01:51:21.531 --> 01:51:23.913
MATT: And a fire staff and a tree stick.

01:51:23.913 --> 01:51:26.448
MARISHA: Not doing too bad.

01:51:26.448 --> 01:51:27.663
MATT: Not a bad haul.

01:51:27.663 --> 01:51:28.919
BRIAN: A cart!

01:51:28.919 --> 01:51:30.033
MARISHA: And a cart.

01:51:30.033 --> 01:51:33.570
LIAM: This could be yours, Trinket, forever and
ever and always.

01:51:33.570 --> 01:51:37.349
MATT: I'm thinking about it, but still. You've
proved to me that you're useful, and you've proved

01:51:37.349 --> 01:51:42.834
to me that you're partner material. Come on,
brains. Lead us to this tavern. Follow your

01:51:42.834 --> 01:51:47.810
brother there. See if you can get us inside this
security door.

01:51:47.810 --> 01:51:51.526
BRIAN: (wheels squeaking)

01:51:51.526 --> 01:51:55.387
(laughter)

01:51:55.387 --> 01:51:58.875
LIAM: Hold up. I take a whiz on the wheels to
silence them.

01:51:58.875 --> 01:52:00.790
MARISHA: Roll for bear?

01:52:00.790 --> 01:52:04.471
(laughter)

01:52:04.471 --> 01:52:05.938
LIAM: I do it!

01:52:05.938 --> 01:52:07.985
MARISHA: You successfully pee on wheels.

01:52:07.985 --> 01:52:09.170
LIAM: Yeah.

01:52:09.170 --> 01:52:14.597
BRIAN: I move the cart to change the wheels so he
can keep a steady stream going.

01:52:14.597 --> 01:52:16.368
LIAM: How's it sound now?

01:52:16.368 --> 01:52:24.504
MARISHA: Much better. You are leaving a bit of
tracks, but it dries in a while. It's good.

01:52:24.504 --> 01:52:26.537
LIAM: The people do that here.

01:52:26.537 --> 01:52:28.453
MATT: Yeah, it's Westruun. It smells like piss
everywhere.

01:52:28.453 --> 01:52:35.836
MARISHA: All right, you guys keep moving, ducking
down alleyways, turning and looking like bears and

01:52:35.836 --> 01:52:45.655
people as you need to. At one point, in the
distance, you hear: "Oh no! We found the Jamesons'

01:52:45.655 --> 01:52:59.097
"lost cows. Hey, can we get a really big wagon?"
That happens in the background. It has people

01:52:59.097 --> 01:53:05.006
distracted for a little bit, it seems. You keep
moving. As you come around the corner, you

01:53:05.006 --> 01:53:10.075
see, across one of the main thoroughfares, the Sun
Kissed Inn.

01:53:10.075 --> 01:53:12.685
BRIAN: That looks familiar.

01:53:12.685 --> 01:53:21.296
MATT: I can't read, but it looks like an inn.
Sun's out. Feeling pretty kissy.

01:53:21.296 --> 01:53:25.203
MARISHA: Looks pretty fancy. Looks nice. You're in
the Opal Ward right now.

01:53:25.203 --> 01:53:27.739
LIAM: Is there a picture of the sun on the sign?

01:53:27.739 --> 01:53:33.339
MARISHA: It's got a nice glow coming up over the
logo.

01:53:33.339 --> 01:53:34.849
LIAM: This is it.

01:53:34.849 --> 01:53:37.887
SAM: Let's go get us some honey. I'm going to go
right through the front door.

01:53:37.887 --> 01:53:39.877
LIAM and TALIESIN: Whoa!

01:53:39.877 --> 01:53:43.272
SAM: What? This is where the honey is, right? Come
on!

01:53:43.272 --> 01:53:46.199
BRIAN: Yeah, but you can't just waltz right in.
She said we've got to go see the head.

01:53:46.199 --> 01:53:47.498
SAM: Who's she?

01:53:47.498 --> 01:53:53.044
LIAM: Peddy. Peddy, I love you, but this is not
your natural environment, even. You're not even a

01:53:53.044 --> 01:53:54.613
bear that's from these parts.

01:53:54.613 --> 01:54:02.086
SAM: All right, I know. I'm from out of town, all
right? Don't make me feel like-- fine.

01:54:02.086 --> 01:54:05.939
LIAM: You're the strongest bear in the group. We
love you. We need you. But come on, let's take it

01:54:05.939 --> 01:54:08.155
one bear paw at a time, all right?

01:54:08.155 --> 01:54:11.312
TALIESIN: One. Just one. I know you've got four.
Just one.

01:54:11.312 --> 01:54:15.650
LIAM: Listen, when we need you to crush somebody's
skulls, who are we going to ask? This guy? No.

01:54:15.650 --> 01:54:18.244
You! Only you.

01:54:18.244 --> 01:54:21.606
MATT: Actually, he's pretty much already almost 
killed one creature, but I get what your point is.

01:54:21.606 --> 01:54:25.439
BRIAN: Cows do not like me. They do not like me.

01:54:25.439 --> 01:54:28.387
TALIESIN: You apparently don't like them.

01:54:28.387 --> 01:54:30.905
BRIAN: When someone calls me a ferret...

01:54:30.905 --> 01:54:35.709
LIAM: We don't insult your integrity. What are we,
animals?

01:54:35.709 --> 01:54:38.651
SAM: What are you, though, seriously? Are you a
mongoose or something?

01:54:38.651 --> 01:54:43.377
BRIAN: No, I'm not a mongoose. Do I have gills? Do
I look like I have gills? I'm not a mongoose.

01:54:43.377 --> 01:54:45.013
SAM: You're right. I should have seen: no gills.

01:54:45.013 --> 01:54:46.503
BRIAN: I'm a honey badger!

01:54:46.503 --> 01:54:47.826
MATT: It's a valid point.

01:54:47.826 --> 01:54:52.991
BRIAN: I'm a honey badger. I'm a little bit
smaller. I wish I was a little bit taller.

01:54:52.991 --> 01:54:55.424
(off-screen laugh)

01:54:55.424 --> 01:54:58.511
(laughter)

01:54:58.511 --> 01:55:03.031
SAM: That's your audience. One person.

01:55:03.116 --> 01:55:12.002
LIAM: All right, cool your jets, Johnny Cash.
Let's case this joint, okay? Waffle! Where's the

01:55:12.002 --> 01:55:13.840
honey smell coming from in this place?

01:55:13.840 --> 01:55:17.687
TALIESIN: (sniffs) I'm trying to pinpoint the
location of the honey.

01:55:17.687 --> 01:55:23.729
MARISHA: You're getting some pretty strong wafts
right through the front door of the Sun Kissed

01:55:23.729 --> 01:55:25.694
Tavern, for sure.

01:55:25.694 --> 01:55:27.886
TALIESIN: I think we've come to the right place.

01:55:27.886 --> 01:55:29.805
SAM: Hey, Waffle?

01:55:29.805 --> 01:55:30.782
TALIESIN: Yeah?

01:55:30.782 --> 01:55:35.208
SAM: There's an exposed pipe here. Maybe you
should sniff right there. You know, hack into the

01:55:35.208 --> 01:55:36.240
mainframe?

01:55:36.240 --> 01:55:40.618
TALIESIN: Don't tell me how to do my business.

01:55:40.618 --> 01:55:41.832
SAM: Sorry.

01:55:41.832 --> 01:55:44.836
TALIESIN: Can I hack the mainframe?

01:55:44.836 --> 01:55:49.560
(laughter)

01:55:49.560 --> 01:55:51.502
BRIAN: Don't tell me how to do what I was just
about to do.

01:55:51.502 --> 01:55:58.260
MARISHA: Yeah. Roll for hacker. Roll for criminal.
It's under criminal.

01:55:58.260 --> 01:56:01.427
LIAM: The last five years of video games have
prepared me for this moment.

01:56:01.427 --> 01:56:02.751
TALIESIN: I do it.

01:56:02.751 --> 01:56:10.770
MARISHA: All right. You get a good sniff, a good
waft. It's a little musty.

01:56:10.770 --> 01:56:12.392
SAM: You're huffing it?

01:56:12.392 --> 01:56:14.748
TALIESIN: No, my whole face is in the
pipe!

01:56:14.748 --> 01:56:26.127
MARISHA: A little bit of fresh laundry, dryer sheets.
You go over and see rat droppings down one side.

01:56:26.127 --> 01:56:30.780
SAM: He can see through the smell?! No, I love
it!

01:56:30.780 --> 01:56:32.228
MARISHA: I'm painting a picture here!

01:56:32.228 --> 01:56:33.788
SAM: No, I love it! Keep it coming!

01:56:33.788 --> 01:56:42.554
MARISHA: You go through, and the smell comes from
this dank air passageway over in the corner, but

01:56:42.554 --> 01:56:48.425
your scent leads you in another direction, and it
jettisons to the left, and it goes up to the

01:56:48.425 --> 01:56:54.003
right, and you see up in this attic loft a
security room.

01:56:54.003 --> 01:56:55.457
TALIESIN: Oh, there's a firewall.

01:56:55.457 --> 01:56:59.460
MARISHA: And that's all you can see, and it snaps
you back into reality.

01:56:59.460 --> 01:57:01.616
TALIESIN: They've got a firewall. I don't think
they got me.

01:57:01.616 --> 01:57:03.400
BRIAN: Don't take the hat near the firewall.

01:57:03.400 --> 01:57:04.772
TALIESIN: No, we're going to keep it very safe.

01:57:04.772 --> 01:57:06.811
LIAM: Point of order. Excuse me, BM. BM?

01:57:06.811 --> 01:57:09.942
SAM: Bear master? Beast master?

01:57:09.942 --> 01:57:12.017
LIAM: Bear master, bee master. Take your pick.

01:57:12.017 --> 01:57:13.445
MARISHA: I'll take beast master.

01:57:13.445 --> 01:57:16.448
LIAM: Can you please paint a picture of the
outside of this building for us humble bears?

01:57:16.448 --> 01:57:24.373
MARISHA: You've got a main thoroughfare in front
of you. Off to your left, you've got the town

01:57:24.373 --> 01:57:30.181
center, where you guys were harassing and
terrifying people. There's a nice fountain in the

01:57:30.181 --> 01:57:31.334
middle of it.

01:57:31.334 --> 01:57:33.927
LIAM: Where we did our expert plan. Yeah, okay.

01:57:33.927 --> 01:57:40.438
MARISHA: Fall foliage in the water of the
fountain. Still pretty rough-looking from where

01:57:40.438 --> 01:57:47.039
there was a mass clearing out of people from the
bear attack, according to the guards. And then off

01:57:47.039 --> 01:57:53.658
the main road, there's the Sun Kissed Inn. It's a
nice white building; looks like it's been pretty

01:57:53.658 --> 01:57:59.653
well-kept. On the bottom floor, there's a tavern.
On the upstairs, there's a little inn you can stay

01:57:59.653 --> 01:58:05.346
at, a little bed-and-breakfast. It's got nice
white columns. A little swinging wood sign says

01:58:05.346 --> 01:58:09.702
Sun Kissed Tavern, with a sun rising up over top
of the title.

01:58:09.702 --> 01:58:13.134
LIAM: What about a side entrance to the security
guard?

01:58:13.134 --> 01:58:22.405
MARISHA: When you keep looking down the main road,
you see another alley-- no, wait. It's this way.

01:58:22.405 --> 01:58:30.226
You see an alley that jettisons off to the left of
the tavern that looks in the direction that his

01:58:30.226 --> 01:58:33.729
hacker sense was taking him.

01:58:33.729 --> 01:58:36.696
LIAM: I didn't smell that. I wasn't there.

01:58:36.696 --> 01:58:40.283
TALIESIN: I think we've got to go around the side.
I think that's our best bet.

01:58:40.283 --> 01:58:41.289
LIAM: All right.

01:58:41.289 --> 01:58:44.282
MARISHA: You've got a catty-corner dart.

01:58:44.282 --> 01:58:48.407
MATT: I wipe the huff coloring off the sides of
Waffle's face.

01:58:48.407 --> 01:58:51.222
SAM: Gold spray paint?

01:58:51.222 --> 01:58:53.597
(laughter)

01:58:53.597 --> 01:58:56.395
MATT: Careful. It ruins your brain.

01:58:56.395 --> 01:58:59.700
BRIAN: You look like my aunt after church. Come
here. Let me get this.

01:58:59.700 --> 01:59:03.133
MARISHA: A little dizzy. It wears off in a
second.

01:59:03.133 --> 01:59:09.092
LIAM: All right. This is good. You're telling me
that the honey is not right through the main doors

01:59:09.092 --> 01:59:10.313
of the tavern.

01:59:10.313 --> 01:59:14.163
TALIESIN: It's deep inside. They've got it
definitely under heavy security.

01:59:14.163 --> 01:59:19.888
LIAM: They've probably got some dipshit upstairs
guarding it, around the back. That's good. This

01:59:19.888 --> 01:59:21.286
works in our favor.

01:59:21.286 --> 01:59:22.366
SAM: I've got an idea.

01:59:22.366 --> 01:59:23.535
MATT: What's your idea?

01:59:23.535 --> 01:59:24.700
BRIAN: Spill the beans!

01:59:24.700 --> 01:59:30.919
SAM: I make a tree right in the middle of the
lobby there. You use your fire stick. Set it on

01:59:30.919 --> 01:59:39.860
fire. The whole place goes up. Problem solved!
Hey, I'm the muscle, all right? I don't come up

01:59:39.860 --> 01:59:41.414
with the plans.

01:59:41.414 --> 01:59:49.343
MATT: Tell you what. If everything goes ass to
sky, that'll be our backup to cover our tracks,

01:59:49.343 --> 01:59:53.243
but we can't start with that. Hold onto it. It's
not a bad idea.

01:59:53.243 --> 01:59:55.878
SAM: There are no bad ideas, right?

01:59:55.878 --> 01:59:57.000
MATT: Exactly!

01:59:57.000 --> 02:00:04.429
TALIESIN: I don't know, maybe we finally heard
one.

02:00:04.494 --> 02:00:08.720
MATT: Can we see, possibly, a stairway or entrance
door to an upper level?

02:00:08.720 --> 02:00:15.309
MARISHA: You can see the entrance from where you
are in this alley. This alley, main street,

02:00:15.309 --> 02:00:20.793
another alley across the street and down that way.
You can see the entrance of the alley, but you

02:00:20.793 --> 02:00:22.791
can't see down it.

02:00:22.791 --> 02:00:25.826
LIAM: We can see the stairway up to security
guards?

02:00:25.826 --> 02:00:29.210
MARISHA: Maybe. You've got to make it to the
alley.

02:00:29.210 --> 02:00:31.003
MATT: Let's get in the alley.

02:00:31.003 --> 02:00:33.161
LIAM: I've got an idea brewing. Let's get a closer
look.

02:00:33.161 --> 02:00:38.922
MARISHA: Everyone roll for criminal to stealthily
cross the street without being seen.

02:00:38.922 --> 02:00:39.682
SAM: Fail!

02:00:39.682 --> 02:00:40.751
MATT: Success.

02:00:40.751 --> 02:00:41.404
LIAM: Fail!

02:00:41.404 --> 02:00:42.805
BRIAN and TALIESIN: Success.

02:00:42.805 --> 02:00:43.860
MARISHA: Okay.

02:00:43.860 --> 02:00:45.601
MATT: Three out of five, maybe?

02:00:45.601 --> 02:00:50.815
MARISHA: Yeah, I was going for a Matt Mercer skill
challenge, where half had to do good.

02:00:50.815 --> 02:00:52.148
LIAM: Who the fuck is that?

02:00:52.148 --> 02:00:53.913
MARISHA: Don't worry about it.

02:00:53.913 --> 02:00:58.641
SAM: Half succeeded, right?

02:00:58.641 --> 02:01:00.081
MARISHA: Yeah, half succeeded. Yeah.

02:01:00.081 --> 02:01:01.238
TALIESIN: More than half.

02:01:01.238 --> 02:01:02.565
MARISHA: You're an uneven number.

02:01:02.565 --> 02:01:04.002
TALIESIN: Tie-breaker.

02:01:04.002 --> 02:01:11.090
MARISHA: I'll allow it. Anyway, you guys crossed
the street, and now you're in the alleyway. At the

02:01:11.090 --> 02:01:18.997
end of it, you see a black nondescript iron door.
It's a little open.

02:01:18.997 --> 02:01:25.159
MATT: It's an iron door on a building made of wood
and plaster? What's the rest of the building

02:01:25.159 --> 02:01:26.149
construct?

02:01:26.149 --> 02:01:27.644
MARISHA: Brick. Brick building.

02:01:27.644 --> 02:01:33.471
MATT: All right, and that door's slightly ajar.
Who wants to take a look at that door?

02:01:33.471 --> 02:01:34.888
SAM: I can knock it in.

02:01:34.888 --> 02:01:38.452
BRIAN: But it's already open! It's already open a
little bit.

02:01:38.452 --> 02:01:45.186
LIAM: May be too good to be true. We go in there--
people, right? They're tricky. They've got brains

02:01:45.186 --> 02:01:48.371
and stuff. Their intelligence is at least eight or
higher.

02:01:48.371 --> 02:01:49.905
BRIAN: What?

02:01:49.905 --> 02:01:52.906
MATT: I don't know. He's the brains.

02:01:52.906 --> 02:01:57.895
LIAM: If we just go in there, it could fucking
blow up in our faces. Maybe that's what we do;

02:01:57.895 --> 02:01:59.889
maybe we have no other option. Here's what I'm
thinking--

02:01:59.889 --> 02:02:01.691
BRIAN: His plan is to blow up everybody's faces.

02:02:01.691 --> 02:02:06.431
LIAM: That's going to blow up the honey, though.
You can't eat burned honey like that.

02:02:06.431 --> 02:02:07.713
BRIAN: Is honey flammable?

02:02:07.713 --> 02:02:08.772
SAM: Does honey burn?

02:02:08.772 --> 02:02:10.506
TALIESIN: Honey absolutely burns.

02:02:10.506 --> 02:02:14.141
BRIAN: What if we burn down everything, and the
only thing that's left is the honey, and then we move all

02:02:14.181 --> 02:02:16.371
the bodies and scoop the honey into the Radio
Flyer?

02:02:16.371 --> 02:02:19.810
LIAM: It's not your fault you're vegan. You have
very little experience with honey. Yes, the honey

02:02:19.810 --> 02:02:20.905
will burn.

02:02:20.905 --> 02:02:23.943
SAM: Nothing wrong with being a vegan, by the way.
I get just as much protein from bamboo.

02:02:23.943 --> 02:02:27.790
LIAM: I'm not saying there's anything wrong with
it. I'm just saying it's real stupid, okay?

02:02:27.790 --> 02:02:34.119
SAM: Listen, it's not my fault that I don't have
to kill an innocent animal to survive like you

02:02:34.119 --> 02:02:35.359
fuckers do.

02:02:35.359 --> 02:02:37.324
MATT: You killed a cow back there.

02:02:37.324 --> 02:02:39.096
SAM: Cows don't count.

02:02:39.096 --> 02:02:48.253
TALIESIN: Hey! We're all hungry. We all want some
honey. Some of us want some bamboo-- that's weird,

02:02:48.253 --> 02:02:49.521
but that's okay.

02:02:49.521 --> 02:02:51.775
BRIAN: Who's going through the door?

02:02:51.775 --> 02:02:54.403
TALIESIN: You're the smallest. Just take a look.

02:02:54.403 --> 02:02:57.174
BRIAN: I can check for traps.

02:02:57.174 --> 02:03:02.910
LIAM: What's above the door? There are giant doors
on the ground floor, right? There's no stairs up

02:03:02.910 --> 02:03:04.182
or nothing?

02:03:04.182 --> 02:03:05.571
MARISHA: Do you want to peek in?

02:03:05.571 --> 02:03:09.671
LIAM: No, I don't. I want to understand what I'm
looking at. Is it brick, stone?

02:03:09.671 --> 02:03:11.305
MARISHA: There's a little stoop.

02:03:11.305 --> 02:03:13.043
LIAM: The building is more than one floor?

02:03:13.043 --> 02:03:14.393
MARISHA: Yes.

02:03:14.393 --> 02:03:16.721
BRIAN: It's an inn with a tavern on the bottom
floor.

02:03:16.721 --> 02:03:22.172
LIAM: Is it possible for a honey badger to climb
up the side of this building?

02:03:22.172 --> 02:03:29.180
BRIAN: Yeah, is there some piping or perhaps a
beautiful Uncharted rope? Why don't you make me a

02:03:29.180 --> 02:03:30.536
tree, you druid?

02:03:30.536 --> 02:03:36.371
MARISHA: There is some piping. Yeah, you could
make a tree. There's some piping, and it goes up.

02:03:36.371 --> 02:03:40.526
There's a little window that doesn't seem to have
much of a purchase, and then there is a balcony on

02:03:40.526 --> 02:03:44.444
the front of the tavern that looks like it leads
to some suites.

02:03:44.444 --> 02:03:48.817
SAM: Sweets! Oh, not like candy.

02:03:48.817 --> 02:03:54.857
LIAM: This is what I'm thinking, and we could rush
in there; it wouldn't be the first time we've done

02:03:54.857 --> 02:04:01.939
that, Waffle. But here's what I'm thinking: one of
us gets up higher than the door and waits, and

02:04:01.939 --> 02:04:08.859
you, Trinket, you speak people pretty good. You
could fool people into thinking you're a human. So

02:04:08.859 --> 02:04:16.012
we send somebody above the door, you knock on it,
draw them out, invite them into a conversation,

02:04:16.012 --> 02:04:20.715
and when they start talking, bam! Honey badger on
their fucking head!

02:04:20.715 --> 02:04:25.070
MATT: That's why you're the brains. All right,
Cookie's got it. Are we all in on this?

02:04:25.070 --> 02:04:27.607
BRIAN: Oh, yeah. I like this one!

02:04:27.607 --> 02:04:28.898
SAM: Do you need a tree?

02:04:28.898 --> 02:04:39.232
BRIAN: No. I've got pipe. I've got suites! I've
got a cart I can jump off of.

02:04:39.232 --> 02:04:41.448
MATT: Cart stays here.

02:04:41.448 --> 02:04:49.077
BRIAN: I can put honey on my hands and stick to
the wall and climb all the way up! I'll use the pipe.

02:04:49.077 --> 02:04:54.496
(laughter)

02:04:54.496 --> 02:05:01.193
MARISHA: Okay. So as you bears are hiding in the
alley, you take this pipe and climb up it. Roll

02:05:01.193 --> 02:05:03.337
for bear. Bear climbing.

02:05:03.337 --> 02:05:08.864
BRIAN: Jesus fuck. Fail.

02:05:08.864 --> 02:05:16.968
MARISHA: You get halfway up the pipe, and it's too
slippery, and you lose purchase, and you go

02:05:16.968 --> 02:05:20.866
(sliding noise) and slide all the way back down.

02:05:20.866 --> 02:05:23.053
BRIAN: What was the other way up?

02:05:23.053 --> 02:05:24.246
SAM: Tree.

02:05:24.246 --> 02:05:29.666
BRIAN: Can we try a tree? Hey, I had some--

02:05:29.666 --> 02:05:31.360
TALIESIN: Never happened before.

02:05:31.360 --> 02:05:33.898
BRIAN: This has never happened to me. I'm 27.

02:05:33.898 --> 02:05:37.266
TALIESIN: That's very old for a honey badger.

02:05:37.266 --> 02:05:41.657
LIAM: You're practically dead! 27?

02:05:41.657 --> 02:05:44.596
SAM: 27?

02:05:44.596 --> 02:05:49.715
BRIAN: I would take the stuff, but the last time,
I was climbing for over four hours--

02:05:49.715 --> 02:05:53.587
SAM: I'm so sorry we're disrespecting an elderly
person.

02:05:53.587 --> 02:05:56.501
LIAM: Don't eat the honey. Rub it into your
flesh.

02:05:56.501 --> 02:05:59.365
SAM: He's not a bear, he's a prairie dog.

02:05:59.365 --> 02:06:03.597
BRIAN: I am not a prairie dog.

02:06:03.597 --> 02:06:09.151
MARISHA: Okay, so you were not feeling too bad
about falling off the post, and then these

02:06:09.151 --> 02:06:12.356
assholes started making fun of you, and now you're
getting a little irritated. Put a point in bear from

02:06:12.356 --> 02:06:13.423
criminal.

02:06:13.423 --> 02:06:15.136
BRIAN: Wait, what?

02:06:15.136 --> 02:06:16.982
MARISHA: Move a point from criminal to bear.

02:06:16.982 --> 02:06:23.216
SAM: All right, here. Let me give you a tree.
Stand back! Stand back, everybody.

02:06:23.216 --> 02:06:26.527
LIAM: Hey, buddy. Have some honey.

02:06:26.527 --> 02:06:28.850
BRIAN: From the cart?

02:06:28.850 --> 02:06:30.288
LIAM: You've earned it.

02:06:30.288 --> 02:06:31.535
BRIAN: All right.

02:06:31.535 --> 02:06:33.867
SAM: Boss, how has he earned it? He hasn't done
anything.

02:06:33.867 --> 02:06:38.189
BRIAN: I tried to climb a pole, and I failed, and
you've been sitting down here taking dumps the

02:06:38.189 --> 02:06:47.186
size of Trinket! Eating all that bamboo. We've got
to stop every five seconds pushing the cart so you

02:06:47.186 --> 02:06:48.464
can take a dump!

02:06:48.464 --> 02:06:52.675
LIAM: I need him to find his mojo again. Let him
have some honey.

02:06:52.675 --> 02:06:59.759
MARISHA: You kill that last jar-- the first half
jar of honey-- to calm down a little bit.

02:06:59.759 --> 02:07:04.352
LIAM: We're going to be swimming in honey any
minute now.

02:07:04.352 --> 02:07:05.585
MARISHA: All right, Peddy.

02:07:05.585 --> 02:07:08.218
SAM: You ready? Okay, stand back, everybody.

02:07:08.218 --> 02:07:11.467
BRIAN: All right, make me a giant wood to climb.

02:07:11.467 --> 02:07:13.899
SAM: I smash the stick down on the ground.

02:07:13.899 --> 02:07:15.472
MARISHA: Roll for criminal.

02:07:15.472 --> 02:07:18.576
SAM: Success.

02:07:18.576 --> 02:07:30.241
MARISHA: Nice! It goes, and you get a big trunk.
Lopsided, and it crashes into the balcony a little

02:07:30.241 --> 02:07:37.098
bit, but it gets there and then gets a little tree
growth at the end. It's not bad.

02:07:37.098 --> 02:07:39.012
SAM: What kind of tree?

02:07:39.012 --> 02:07:41.073
MARISHA: An oak.

02:07:41.073 --> 02:07:42.343
SAM: Sure.

02:07:42.343 --> 02:07:50.479
TALIESIN: Ah, the Marisha "no fucks given" voice.
What the fuck do you need, motherfucker?

02:07:50.479 --> 02:07:52.745
MARISHA: A silver maple.

02:07:52.745 --> 02:07:57.422
SAM: What color would the bark be?

02:07:57.422 --> 02:08:00.679
MARISHA: Brown.

02:08:00.679 --> 02:08:02.382
SAM: Lightish-brown?

02:08:02.382 --> 02:08:04.772
MARISHA: No, this looks like--

02:08:04.772 --> 02:08:06.329
SAM: Fuck it. I'm going to start eating it.

02:08:06.329 --> 02:08:12.348
MARISHA: Okay. You start gnawing at the base of
the tree. As you're climbing, Peddy can't help

02:08:12.348 --> 02:08:13.339
himself.

02:08:13.339 --> 02:08:24.915
BRIAN: I climb up, get to the bushy part, to where
I can't be seen, and then I, real quick, pee down

02:08:24.915 --> 02:08:30.370
onto Peddy and say: Honey badger don't care!

02:08:30.370 --> 02:08:36.486
LIAM: This is a Foster badger.

02:08:36.486 --> 02:08:39.967
(laughter)

02:08:39.967 --> 02:08:41.993
MARISHA: You get up to the top of the balcony.

02:08:41.993 --> 02:08:45.461
MATT: I loudly whisper: are you in place?

02:08:45.461 --> 02:08:50.501
BRIAN: Yes. Wait! Okay, I'm finished.

02:08:50.501 --> 02:09:01.387
MARISHA: You scurry up the tree, peek in the first
window. Empty suite, nicely made hotel bed.

02:09:01.387 --> 02:09:03.156
BRIAN: Any honey?

02:09:03.156 --> 02:09:05.537
MARISHA: No. Pretty empty.

02:09:05.537 --> 02:09:08.073
BRIAN: They don't leave a little honey on the
pillow?

02:09:08.073 --> 02:09:09.451
MARISHA: No honey samples.

02:09:09.451 --> 02:09:13.346
SAM: Turndown service? Honey service?

02:09:13.346 --> 02:09:17.862
LIAM: Liam! Liam, what are you doing up there?

02:09:17.862 --> 02:09:25.494
BRIAN: I don't see any honey. I see a pretty nice
suite. I would stay here.

02:09:25.494 --> 02:09:30.980
LIAM: Great. The plan is, you've got to teabag a
guy when he comes out the door, so stop peeking in

02:09:30.980 --> 02:09:34.186
the windows now that you're done and get ready,
all right?

02:09:34.186 --> 02:09:35.509
BRIAN: Okay.

02:09:35.509 --> 02:09:39.635
LIAM: We're going to let the thespian here do his
thing, then back off.

02:09:39.635 --> 02:09:42.702
BRIAN: The room is empty, and empty of honey.

02:09:42.702 --> 02:09:47.155
MARISHA: There is another window up further from
it on the balcony.

02:09:47.155 --> 02:09:50.633
BRIAN: Is it climbable? I'll climb over there.

02:09:50.633 --> 02:09:52.233
LIAM: I swear to god--

02:09:52.233 --> 02:09:55.530
SAM: Does the door look like it swings in or out?

02:09:55.530 --> 02:09:56.585
MARISHA: Out.

02:09:56.585 --> 02:09:57.778
SAM: It swings out?

02:09:57.778 --> 02:09:59.231
BRIAN: And it's open a little bit, you said?

02:09:59.231 --> 02:10:00.230
MARISHA: Yeah, it's cracked.

02:10:00.230 --> 02:10:07.985
SAM: I'm going to stand in the cavity where the
door swings so I'll be hiding behind the door when

02:10:07.985 --> 02:10:11.235
the door's open, just in case I need to deliver
some muscle.

02:10:11.235 --> 02:10:12.738
MATT: That's a good idea.

02:10:12.738 --> 02:10:14.699
BRIAN: Deliver some muscle?

02:10:14.699 --> 02:10:16.244
SAM: Yeah, gopher. Shut up.

02:10:16.244 --> 02:10:20.374
BRIAN: Like someone ordered it? You're going to
deliver muscle to someone? Hello! Muscle's here.

02:10:20.374 --> 02:10:22.226
Someone ask for muscle?

02:10:22.226 --> 02:10:23.652
SAM: Stop peeing on my tree.

02:10:23.652 --> 02:10:24.943
MATT: Shut it!

02:10:24.943 --> 02:10:26.800
LIAM: Everybody shut the fuck up, okay?

02:10:26.800 --> 02:10:28.016
BRIAN: It's not delivery, it's DiMuscle.

02:10:28.016 --> 02:10:29.670
LIAM: Hey, meerkat? Zip it.

02:10:29.670 --> 02:10:33.154
BRIAN: Sorry. I'm going to go look at this other
window.

02:10:33.154 --> 02:10:35.190
MATT: Are you in place?

02:10:35.190 --> 02:10:37.381
TALIESIN: He's doing something.

02:10:37.381 --> 02:10:39.108
BRIAN: I'm going to check out the other window.

02:10:39.108 --> 02:10:44.786
MARISHA: You peek up carefully, after these guys
yelled at you, and as you peek up, you see a

02:10:44.786 --> 02:10:52.742
room. It looks like it's a hotel suite that's been
taken over temporarily for the Hazel Festival.

02:10:52.742 --> 02:10:58.868
It's covered in black curtains. There's a little
sliver of curtain that you're peeking through.

02:10:58.868 --> 02:11:10.223
Inside, you see square scrying mirrors lined up
along the wall. Papers, a writing desk, and a man

02:11:10.223 --> 02:11:16.748
in a security uniform-- Westruun colors, of
course-- walking back and forth, pacing. Looks

02:11:16.748 --> 02:11:18.492
like he's talking over an earpiece.

02:11:18.492 --> 02:11:26.803
BRIAN: Hey! I see the future victim of my
teabagging! He's here.

02:11:26.803 --> 02:11:27.722
MATT: Up there?

02:11:27.722 --> 02:11:31.995
BRIAN: Yeah, he's in the window. He's got
something in his head.

02:11:31.995 --> 02:11:37.844
LIAM: Look, Trinket's going to knock. Tell us what
he does when Trinket knocks.

02:11:37.844 --> 02:11:40.204
BRIAN: Okay. But don't teabag him yet?

02:11:40.204 --> 02:11:41.618
SAM: Trinket?

02:11:41.618 --> 02:11:42.621
MATT: Yes?

02:11:42.621 --> 02:11:47.308
SAM: If you get in trouble and need me to swing
the door and cause some "panda-monium"

02:11:47.308 --> 02:11:48.316
-- trademarked--

02:11:48.316 --> 02:11:52.534
TALIESIN: We almost made it.

02:11:52.534 --> 02:11:54.325
MARISHA: Surprised that hadn't happened sooner.

02:11:54.325 --> 02:11:56.861
BRIAN: Almost made it. I just lost $500.

02:11:56.861 --> 02:12:02.163
(laughter)

02:12:02.163 --> 02:12:04.992
BRIAN: I've got to call a guy after this!

02:12:04.992 --> 02:12:06.469
MATT: Go on.

02:12:06.469 --> 02:12:09.049
SAM: What's the signal? Give me a code word. Give
me a signal.

02:12:09.049 --> 02:12:18.537
MATT: The codeword is... dollars. How about that?

02:12:18.537 --> 02:12:22.687
SAM: Dollars? Okay. Why would that come up in a
conversation?

02:12:22.687 --> 02:12:25.137
MATT: I don't know. Figure it out.

02:12:25.137 --> 02:12:28.914
LIAM: Dollars, dollars, dollars!

02:12:28.914 --> 02:12:29.910
TALIESIN: Dollars!

02:12:29.910 --> 02:12:31.016
MATT: I don't know. All right.

02:12:31.016 --> 02:12:32.854
SAM: All right, I'm ready.

02:12:32.854 --> 02:12:34.696
MATT: (thudding)

02:12:34.696 --> 02:12:43.749
MARISHA: Las Vegas, you see him look over his
shoulder, and he frustratedly goes,

02:12:43.749 --> 02:12:50.371
"Get on out of here. Go away! I'm busy." 
And he goes back and starts looking back into

02:12:50.371 --> 02:12:55.745
the mirrors, occasionally being like, "Any sign 
of them? Anyone find those goddamn bears?"

02:12:55.745 --> 02:12:57.246
MATT: Anything?

02:12:57.246 --> 02:13:02.011
BRIAN: They're definitely looking for you bears,
that's for sure.

02:13:02.011 --> 02:13:03.752
MATT: (thudding)

02:13:03.752 --> 02:13:12.161
MARISHA: "Ugh. Goddamn it." You see him leave the
room. Trinket, you start hearing--

02:13:12.161 --> 02:13:14.513
BRIAN: He's coming down!

02:13:14.513 --> 02:13:19.275
MATT: I begin to move a little bit off to the side
of the door where it'll be opening, so only part

02:13:19.275 --> 02:13:20.707
of me is visible.

02:13:20.707 --> 02:13:22.911
BRIAN: I climb into the room and under the bed.

02:13:22.911 --> 02:13:24.644
MARISHA: Okay.

02:13:24.644 --> 02:13:29.239
TALIESIN: We're on either side. I'm going to push
against the side of the wall.

02:13:29.239 --> 02:13:32.913
LIAM: How's your criminal looking? Not too high,
Brian. Not too high.

02:13:32.913 --> 02:13:34.746
MATT: I keep knocking.

02:13:34.746 --> 02:13:38.603
MARISHA: He goes, "All right, all right!" He
throws open the door. "What, goddamn it?"

02:13:38.603 --> 02:13:40.965
LIAM: Las Vegas!

02:13:40.965 --> 02:13:53.119
MATT: Have you heard of our lord and savior of
latter-day Allhammer?

02:13:53.119 --> 02:13:58.929
MARISHA: "You guys, I think the bears are rabid,
and I think they're trying to talk to me.

02:13:58.929 --> 02:14:01.676
"I think I've got one right here. 
I'll be goddamned."

02:14:01.676 --> 02:14:05.751
MATT: Make some dollars. Make some dollars. 
Make some dollars! Dollars! Dollars!

02:14:05.751 --> 02:14:07.276
BRIAN: I'm coming down.

02:14:07.276 --> 02:14:08.588
SAM: I'm going for it!

02:14:08.588 --> 02:14:10.895
BRIAN: Attack!

02:14:10.895 --> 02:14:18.613
MARISHA: Okay. The poor guy gets flanked. From
behind the open door, he gets slammed with an iron

02:14:18.613 --> 02:14:25.649
door to the face as a panda bear comes out from
the other side, and right as he sees this big

02:14:25.649 --> 02:14:31.327
black-and-white face come around the corner, Liam
Las Vegas comes from behind and gets him in the

02:14:31.327 --> 02:14:36.763
back, in the nape of the neck. Roll for bear. You
get carnal advantage.

02:14:36.763 --> 02:14:40.524
MATT: Carnal advantage? That's a different skill.

02:14:40.524 --> 02:14:42.209
BRIAN: Success!

02:14:42.249 --> 02:14:43.238
SAM: Fail.

02:14:43.238 --> 02:14:52.172
MARISHA: Okay. He's distracted by you. I don't
think you understood the term "dollars," and you

02:14:52.172 --> 02:14:58.960
waved dopily, and he is now grabbing onto your
scruff, fighting, and he slams the back of his

02:14:58.960 --> 02:15:02.998
head into the wall, beating you up a little bit.
Take a point in bear.

02:15:02.998 --> 02:15:06.948
SAM: Take a point to bear or off bear?

02:15:06.948 --> 02:15:09.059
MARISHA: A point from criminal to bear.

02:15:09.059 --> 02:15:10.602
BRIAN: Oh shit. Okay.

02:15:10.602 --> 02:15:16.791
TALIESIN: I'm going to try and very slyly snatch
his earring in the commotion.

02:15:16.791 --> 02:15:19.077
LIAM: God, his ear's going to come off.

02:15:19.077 --> 02:15:21.159
TALIESIN: I may hack the ear.

02:15:21.159 --> 02:15:24.754
MARISHA: Hack the ear? Okay.

02:15:24.754 --> 02:15:29.198
TALIESIN: Try to hack the earring. I'm going to
try and grab it and put it on my ear.

02:15:29.198 --> 02:15:31.632
MARISHA: All right, roll for criminal.

02:15:31.632 --> 02:15:33.308
TALIESIN: With hacker advantage.

02:15:33.308 --> 02:15:35.275
MARISHA: Sure. Ear hacking.

02:15:35.275 --> 02:15:37.276
TALIESIN: Going for it.

02:15:37.276 --> 02:15:38.968
LIAM: Come on, Waffle.

02:15:38.968 --> 02:15:40.780
TALIESIN: No, I fail.

02:15:40.780 --> 02:15:48.638
MARISHA: Okay. The guy is thrashing around too
much. As you go to reach for his ear, he

02:15:48.638 --> 02:15:55.019
immediately sucker-punches you in the jaw. Take a
point into bear.

02:15:55.019 --> 02:16:00.947
MATT: Okay, if this is happening, I turn to Cookie
and say: Hold him down. He's got a kid; we can't

02:16:00.947 --> 02:16:02.164
kill him.

02:16:02.164 --> 02:16:04.442
SAM: He's got a kid?

02:16:04.442 --> 02:16:06.526
MATT: Yeah, the kid that gave us the information.

02:16:06.526 --> 02:16:07.998
MAIRSHA: "Head of security!"

02:16:07.998 --> 02:16:10.980
SAM: That's right.

02:16:10.980 --> 02:16:12.776
TALIESIN: I had totally forgotten that there was
any relation.

02:16:12.776 --> 02:16:16.568
MATT: I'm the only hero here, apparently.

02:16:16.568 --> 02:16:18.714
TALIESIN: No, this is like Captain Planet. You're
Heart.

02:16:18.714 --> 02:16:20.326
MATT: Apparently, yeah.

02:16:20.326 --> 02:16:28.850
MARISHA: Liam, you hear-- Liam Las Vegas, you
hear, since you're right up on his neck, you hear

02:16:28.850 --> 02:16:36.046
over the earpiece, very faintly: "Hey, boss? Okay,
we're heading your way, boss. Boss, come in."

02:16:36.046 --> 02:16:43.721
BRIAN: Don't come here! I am fine. I have no-- 
I am not in any danger!

02:16:43.721 --> 02:16:46.481
Everything is perfectly fine!

02:16:46.481 --> 02:16:48.071
MARISHA: "Boss?"

02:16:48.071 --> 02:16:50.637
BRIAN: This is how he was talking before!

02:16:50.637 --> 02:16:55.113
MARISHA: You hear, "Boss Buford? I mean no
offense, but have you been drinking again?"

02:16:55.113 --> 02:16:58.923
BRIAN: Maybe a tiny bit. Look, it was a slow
night.

02:16:58.923 --> 02:17:04.746
MARISHA: Buford slams you up against the wall
again. What are the rest of you all doing?

02:17:04.746 --> 02:17:13.590
MATT: I'm going to pull him off of Buford, as he's
slammed Las Vegas into the wall. I'm going to pull

02:17:13.590 --> 02:17:18.256
Vegas off while I slam &lt;i&gt;him&lt;/i&gt; into the wall and get
my bear snout right into his face and give him an

02:17:18.256 --> 02:17:20.975
intimidating growl to get him to stop thrashing.

02:17:20.975 --> 02:17:24.973
MARISHA: Okay, roll for terrify with advantage
under your bear stat.

02:17:24.973 --> 02:17:27.435
MATT: I succeed, with a one.

02:17:27.435 --> 02:17:34.521
MARISHA: He goes, "All right. Just... I'll let you
go."

02:17:34.521 --> 02:17:39.921
MATT: I look at him, and I point with a bear claw
and go, (grunts). And I take some of the honey

02:17:39.921 --> 02:17:47.709
from my bearpit and go, (grunts). Where?

02:17:47.709 --> 02:17:52.748
MARISHA: "Did you just say 'where?' Holy shit."

02:17:52.748 --> 02:17:54.098
MATT: Where?

02:17:54.098 --> 02:18:00.772
MARISHA: "All right. Look, it's down there. 
Go through the Sun Kissed Inn.

02:18:00.772 --> 02:18:04.830
"Go into the cellar room. There's a door. 
You've got to get on the other side of it.

02:18:04.830 --> 02:18:09.701
"Look, just-- here." 
And he pulls out of his back pocket.

02:18:09.701 --> 02:18:18.779
"I fucking hate this job, anyway. It's a piece 
of shit. Go get the honey, all right?"

02:18:18.779 --> 02:18:29.985
MATT: I wipe the honey back in my bear pit and
pull him off to where the door is, where it's

02:18:29.985 --> 02:18:31.776
open, make sure that all of us are inside--

02:18:31.776 --> 02:18:37.351
MARISHA: He looks at the badger, and he goes,
"Here." He doesn't know what you're doing, so in

02:18:37.351 --> 02:18:42.903
another attempt, pulls out a honey sample from his
pocket and goes, "Here!"

02:18:42.903 --> 02:18:45.007
BRIAN: (eager growling)

02:18:45.007 --> 02:18:48.490
MARISHA: And he throws it behind your shoulder to
get you to run away.

02:18:48.490 --> 02:18:54.352
MATT: Do you want to grab the barrel and bring it
in?

02:18:54.352 --> 02:18:56.580
TALIESIN: Yeah, we're getting everything.

02:18:56.580 --> 02:19:06.724
MATT: Okay, so as soon as we get our last honey
jar, the de Rolo Roller in, I shove him back out

02:19:06.724 --> 02:19:10.756
and close the metal door, and then try and find a
way to lock it.

02:19:10.756 --> 02:19:12.527
MARISHA: How are you going to lock it?

02:19:12.527 --> 02:19:15.400
TALIESIN: Is it digital?

02:19:15.400 --> 02:19:21.914
MATT: (laughs) Is there any sort of locking
mechanism or a barricade?

02:19:21.914 --> 02:19:29.287
MARISHA: It's pretty smooth on the outside. Seems
like most of the locking handles are from the

02:19:29.287 --> 02:19:30.631
other side.

02:19:30.631 --> 02:19:34.688
SAM: We could put some stuff in front of the door.
Is there any stuff around the room?

02:19:34.688 --> 02:19:36.853
MARISHA: You did summon a giant tree trunk.

02:19:36.853 --> 02:19:39.142
SAM: We could. Wait, what did you say, boss?

02:19:39.142 --> 02:19:42.364
LIAM: What's to stop the kid from squealing that
we done just thrown out the door?

02:19:42.364 --> 02:19:44.524
BRIAN: I ripped his tongue out before we left.

02:19:44.524 --> 02:19:45.656
LIAM: Did you?

02:19:45.656 --> 02:19:47.595
BRIAN: Nah. I thought about it for a second.

02:19:47.595 --> 02:19:53.735
MARISHA: As you're holding the door, you hear,
(thudding) "Hey, come on!" from the other side.

02:19:53.735 --> 02:19:56.229
SAM: Want me to make a trunk?

02:19:56.229 --> 02:19:59.681
MATT: Peddy, knock him out. I open the door.

02:19:59.681 --> 02:20:03.110
SAM: All right, I'm going to bum-rush him.

02:20:03.110 --> 02:20:05.380
MARISHA: Okay, roll two because you're the
muscle.

02:20:05.380 --> 02:20:07.087
LIAM: Drag his ass in here, Peddy.

02:20:07.087 --> 02:20:10.661
SAM: It doesn't matter. I succeeded on the first
one.

02:20:10.661 --> 02:20:17.736
MARISHA: As the door swings back open, he's met
with a giant panda bear head.

02:20:17.736 --> 02:20:20.292
SAM: (roars)

02:20:20.292 --> 02:20:24.128
MARISHA: He gets whacked in the head and falls
unconscious immediately.

02:20:24.128 --> 02:20:25.739
BRIAN: Can I search his body for more honey?

02:20:25.739 --> 02:20:31.654
MARISHA: Sure. You don't find any. You do find an
old biscuit.

02:20:31.654 --> 02:20:33.260
BRIAN: How old?

02:20:33.260 --> 02:20:41.062
MARISHA: Looks like he put it in his pocket from
this morning. It's a little style. A little stale.

02:20:41.062 --> 02:20:47.775
Not style. It's a little stale. It's an everything
biscuit, like an everything bagel, but an

02:20:47.775 --> 02:20:49.135
everything biscuit.

02:20:49.135 --> 02:20:53.616
TALIESIN: Slayer's Cake. Everything biscuit.

02:20:53.616 --> 02:20:55.946
BRIAN: Isn't that the fraternity initiation
biscuit?

02:20:55.946 --> 02:20:57.613
SAM: Oh, gross.

02:20:57.613 --> 02:21:01.322
BRIAN: She said "everything biscuit," and don't
say "gross" to me, Sam Riegel.

02:21:01.322 --> 02:21:04.651
LIAM: Where does my nose tell me where to go?

02:21:04.651 --> 02:21:13.789
MARISHA: Well, the Sun Kissed Inn, the entrance is
out and through the front door. It's not. This

02:21:13.789 --> 02:21:17.413
appears to be separate, leading up.

02:21:17.413 --> 02:21:20.493
TALIESIN: We've got to get in. I want to take a
look at that security room.

02:21:20.493 --> 02:21:25.634
MARISHA: You open the door. You look behind the
guy unconscious on the floor. Are you going to do

02:21:25.634 --> 02:21:26.814
anything with his body?

02:21:26.814 --> 02:21:29.734
SAM: I'm going to drag it inside and look for a
place to stow it.

02:21:29.734 --> 02:21:31.083
BRIAN: Does he have any keys on his body?

02:21:31.083 --> 02:21:33.187
TALIESIN: Use him to prop the door closed.

02:21:33.187 --> 02:21:36.183
MARISHA: He does have keys on his body, yes.

02:21:36.183 --> 02:21:37.445
BRIAN: Can I take those keys?

02:21:37.445 --> 02:21:38.562
MARISHA: You can take those keys.

02:21:38.562 --> 02:21:42.241
BRIAN: Put them in the de Rolo Roller.

02:21:42.241 --> 02:21:44.453
MARISHA: Yeah, okay.

02:21:44.453 --> 02:21:48.114
BRIAN: In case we want to go up 
to the honeymoon suite.

02:21:48.114 --> 02:21:53.508
MARISHA: This is literally just a stairwell entrance.
It's very thin, clearly there for service and

02:21:53.508 --> 02:21:59.775
bringing in stock. It's a narrow little room.
There seems to be a cupboard under the stairs, if

02:21:59.775 --> 02:22:01.122
you want to stash him there.

02:22:01.122 --> 02:22:05.294
SAM: I'm going to grab him with my teeth 
and try to shove him under the stairs.

02:22:05.294 --> 02:22:12.016
MARISHA: There's a thin stairwell that goes up and
opens up into a loft area. There's one door that

02:22:12.016 --> 02:22:16.391
looks like it was suite #1 and another door that
looks like it was suite #2, where this was.

02:22:16.391 --> 02:22:17.588
LIAM: Get up there.

02:22:17.588 --> 02:22:26.397
MARISHA: As you guys enter in, you open the room.
You see four screens. They're all scrying mirrors.

02:22:26.397 --> 02:22:32.720
A few notes, a few papers, binoculars. A few
bottles of mead. Looks like Buford

02:22:32.720 --> 02:22:34.044
was having a good time.

02:22:34.044 --> 02:22:35.489
MATT: Is it honey mead?

02:22:35.489 --> 02:22:36.635
MARISHA: It is honey mead.

02:22:36.635 --> 02:22:37.923
TALIESIN: All mead is honey mead.

02:22:37.923 --> 02:22:43.783
MATT: I know, but I'm a bear, so I have to
clarify. Can I take one of the bottles

02:22:43.783 --> 02:22:44.852
and drink it?

02:22:44.852 --> 02:22:45.912
MARISHA: You do.

02:22:45.912 --> 02:22:48.143
MATT: (gulping)

02:22:48.143 --> 02:22:56.380
MARISHA: I would say you put a point back into
bear from criminal. You are a little tipsy,

02:22:56.380 --> 02:22:59.187
though, for a little bit.

02:22:59.187 --> 02:23:01.466
MATT: (slurred) It's fine. We're good!

02:23:01.466 --> 02:23:04.860
MARISHA: I don't know how terrifying you might be
for a little bit.

02:23:04.860 --> 02:23:07.436
MATT: Oh, you haven't been around the right people
and enough mead.

02:23:07.436 --> 02:23:12.826
BRIAN: This reminds me, fellows, of the time
Trinket got a little too drunk

02:23:12.826 --> 02:23:14.610
when we were all out at--

02:23:14.610 --> 02:23:18.118
MATT: In this room?

02:23:18.118 --> 02:23:22.999
BRIAN: (laughing) I need a flashback really bad.

02:23:22.999 --> 02:23:26.309
SAM: We just met this guy an hour ago.

02:23:26.309 --> 02:23:29.802
BRIAN: Well, this reminds me of when my cousin
Blinket--

02:23:29.802 --> 02:23:35.592
SAM: Who will also be portrayed by Matthew Mercer
in the flashback? Sure.

02:23:35.592 --> 02:23:40.061
BRIAN: One time, he also got really-- 
I don't know why I went western all of a sudden.

02:23:40.061 --> 02:23:42.015
Anyway, flashback.

02:23:42.015 --> 02:23:43.483
LIAM: He was a bush baby.

02:23:43.483 --> 02:23:46.396
MATT: I'm so drunk and your cousin.

02:23:46.396 --> 02:23:48.582
BRIAN: Ah, he's my cousin.

02:23:48.582 --> 02:23:50.516
MATT: I'm a cousin who's drunk.

02:23:50.516 --> 02:23:56.059
BRIAN: Yeah, anyway, and sadly, we had to take old
Blinket out back and shoot him, because it turned

02:23:56.059 --> 02:23:59.506
out he wasn't our cousin. He was brought into town
by the circus.

02:23:59.506 --> 02:24:06.702
MARISHA: Wow. Holy shit. That definitely qualifies
as a flashback to being a criminal. Get a point

02:24:06.702 --> 02:24:10.614
back from bear to criminal. You're good.

02:24:10.614 --> 02:24:15.493
TALIESIN: I want to take a look at this weird
security system that they have here with all these

02:24:15.493 --> 02:24:20.297
mirrors. Are they viewing other rooms?

02:24:20.297 --> 02:24:27.185
MARISHA: They are. You look at one of them. The
first one is the town square. The second one looks

02:24:27.185 --> 02:24:32.945
like the entrance to the tavern. You see a few
people passed out drunk at tables and a lot of

02:24:32.945 --> 02:24:50.071
action going on. The other two, there's codes in
the corner. It says S-C-R-Y-C-A-M-S-L-R-1.

02:24:50.071 --> 02:24:53.176
Wait, C-L-R-1 and C-L-R-2. It's not important.

02:24:53.176 --> 02:25:01.808
(laughter)

02:25:01.855 --> 02:25:04.588
TALIESIN: Isn't it, though? Isn't it kind of
fucking important, really?

02:25:04.588 --> 02:25:10.029
MARISHA: There's town square, tavern, cellar room
one, cellar room two. That's all you need.

02:25:10.029 --> 02:25:11.919
LIAM: That's what's on these papers here?

02:25:11.919 --> 02:25:19.122
MARISHA: That's what's blinking in the corner of
each of these cameras. Mirrors. Scrying mirrors.

02:25:19.122 --> 02:25:22.514
TALIESIN: I think I can hack these mirrors.

02:25:22.514 --> 02:25:25.482
MARISHA: All right, try to hack the mirrors.

02:25:25.482 --> 02:25:26.981
TALIESIN: I want them to run a loop.

02:25:26.981 --> 02:25:28.522
MARISHA: You want to throw them on a loop?

02:25:28.522 --> 02:25:30.045
TALIESIN: I want to throw them on a loop.

02:25:30.045 --> 02:25:31.323
LIAM: Let the bear work. Let him do his thing.

02:25:31.323 --> 02:25:39.393
MARISHA: That's pretty good. All right, hacker
bear. Roll for hacking.

02:25:39.393 --> 02:25:45.040
TALIESIN: I'm going to mime keyboarding, 
but in doing so, it's going to somehow

02:25:45.040 --> 02:25:46.989
affect a magical spell.

02:25:46.989 --> 02:25:48.228
MARISHA: Sure.

02:25:48.228 --> 02:25:49.721
LIAM: You've got this, Waffle.

02:25:49.721 --> 02:25:53.796
BRIAN: (singing) You came in like a hacker bear.

02:25:53.796 --> 02:25:57.492
TALIESIN: Yeah! Double two.

02:25:57.492 --> 02:26:06.809
MARISHA: As you're hacking, you get a waft of air
from one of the vents off to the side, and it

02:26:06.809 --> 02:26:17.034
brings you back to the pipes in the tunnels, and
in your cracked-out state, you somehow connect to

02:26:17.034 --> 02:26:22.440
the mainframe, and it takes you through, and you
see the tavern, and you see two people passed out

02:26:22.440 --> 02:26:27.852
drunk, and you go through into the first room, and
you see a few tripwires that seem to be strung out

02:26:27.852 --> 02:26:34.382
across the long hallway, and then you go into the
last room, and you see three pedestals, with a

02:26:34.382 --> 02:26:39.235
bunch of honey stacked onto these pedestals. It's
very dimly lit, but you recognize the shape of

02:26:39.235 --> 02:26:40.739
fucking honey barrels.

02:26:40.739 --> 02:26:44.087
TALIESIN: Motherfucking honey barrels.

02:26:44.087 --> 02:26:46.466
LIAM: Barrels? Did you say &lt;i&gt;barrels&lt;/i&gt;?

02:26:46.466 --> 02:26:48.038
TALIESIN: We hit the mother lode.

02:26:48.038 --> 02:26:50.752
BRIAN: I don't know if I have room on the cart for
all of this.

02:26:50.752 --> 02:26:59.976
MARISHA: You go back, and you see Matrix code 
go in front of you, and lights fly by.

02:26:59.976 --> 02:27:06.818
LIAM: Some people see zeros and ones, 
but all I see is honeybees and salmon.

02:27:06.818 --> 02:27:09.391
(laughter)

02:27:09.391 --> 02:27:14.703
MARISHA: You see a bunch of worker bees 
in a hex pattern that looks code-y.

02:27:14.703 --> 02:27:17.377
It's a little green, a little black, like DOS.

02:27:17.377 --> 02:27:18.789
TALIESIN: I'm starting to believe!

02:27:18.789 --> 02:27:23.042
MARISHA: The rest of you see Waffle get a little
nosebleed.

02:27:23.042 --> 02:27:27.235
MATT: Waffle. Waffle!

02:27:27.235 --> 02:27:37.532
MARISHA: As you snap back, you look, and you saw
one guard walk by in the town square entrance.

02:27:37.532 --> 02:27:42.876
About 30 seconds, same guard walks by.

02:27:42.876 --> 02:27:44.826
SAM: It's on a loop.

02:27:44.826 --> 02:27:46.881
TALIESIN: We're clear.

02:27:46.881 --> 02:27:48.561
LIAM: Waffle's going to fight Sugarcone!

02:27:48.561 --> 02:27:59.414
MARISHA: It seems, through whatever magic that you
have tapped into, you have been a little touched

02:27:59.414 --> 02:28:05.528
by the security cam. Security hacking.

02:28:05.528 --> 02:28:13.530
TALIESIN: What?! Wow. This is insane.

02:28:13.530 --> 02:28:15.758
MARISHA: You have to be able to see the honey.

02:28:15.758 --> 02:28:22.891
TALIESIN: No, I get it. This will definitely not
come in useful at all. This is useless and dumb,

02:28:22.891 --> 02:28:24.463
and I can't wait to do it.

02:28:24.463 --> 02:28:31.234
MARISHA: He comes back, and Waffle's got a little
gloss to his eyes. A little bit of a green glow

02:28:31.234 --> 02:28:34.576
crosses them.

02:28:34.576 --> 02:28:39.141
TALIESIN: Ready for an Eggo Waffle. 
I've upgraded to Eggo.

02:28:39.141 --> 02:28:41.371
BRIAN: You look more Belgian to me.

02:28:41.371 --> 02:28:43.253
LIAM: You all right, brother bear?

02:28:43.253 --> 02:28:44.495
TALIESIN: Never better.

02:28:44.495 --> 02:28:46.505
SAM: How do we get down there, 
or wherever we've got to go?

02:28:46.505 --> 02:28:48.419
TALIESIN: That I can't tell you, but I bought us
some time.

02:28:48.419 --> 02:28:50.137
BRIAN: Why is your voice so lame now?

02:28:50.137 --> 02:28:51.504
SAM: I'm sorry.

02:28:51.504 --> 02:28:57.963
MATT: (laughs) Hey, Peddy? Which one of these
rooms has the tree outside of it?

02:28:57.963 --> 02:29:04.196
SAM: It was the one on the left, which is the
first one that he went to. The empty one.

02:29:04.196 --> 02:29:08.225
MATT: All right, we'll follow Vegas. Lead us to
the tree. We'll climb down and go around to the

02:29:08.225 --> 02:29:09.387
inside of the tavern.

02:29:09.387 --> 02:29:13.433
MARISHA: That's good, because right as you walk
out onto the balcony, you see that guard who was

02:29:13.433 --> 02:29:17.590
walking through that you captured on your loop
start walking around, going,

02:29:17.590 --> 02:29:21.055
"Hey, boss? Boss, you here?"

02:29:21.055 --> 02:29:24.829
MATT: Hey, Peddy? Take him out.

02:29:24.829 --> 02:29:26.513
SMA: Where is he? He's down below us?

02:29:26.513 --> 02:29:31.614
MARISHA: He's walking under the balcony, 
looking like he's going to go around

02:29:31.614 --> 02:29:33.332
that alleyway, up to that door.

02:29:33.332 --> 02:29:35.937
LIAM: Peddy, teabag that motherfucker.

02:29:35.937 --> 02:29:39.432
SAM: I'm muscle, but I'm not aerodynamic. 
I climb up bamboo, I don't--

02:29:39.432 --> 02:29:41.996
LIAM: I boot him out the window.

02:29:41.996 --> 02:29:46.097
SAM: (screams)

02:29:46.097 --> 02:30:00.009
MARISHA: Roll for criminal aim, as you try to time
pushing Peddy Tuxpin.

02:30:00.009 --> 02:30:04.180
LIAM: Come on, don't fuck me. One. Yeah.

02:30:04.180 --> 02:30:14.917
MARISHA: You accurately, with great precision,
teabag this poor guard and fall right on top of

02:30:14.917 --> 02:30:17.990
him. He's not dead; he's definitely unconscious,
though.

02:30:17.990 --> 02:30:24.074
TALIESIN: The last thing he saw before going
unconscious were panda testicles at full speed.

02:30:24.074 --> 02:30:26.468
As he screams--

02:30:26.468 --> 02:30:30.056
MATT: A giant tanuki flash.

02:30:30.056 --> 02:30:34.349
MARISHA: He quite literally does not know 
what hit him.

02:30:34.349 --> 02:30:40.412
BRIAN: Next week's Wyrmwood giveaway is
"pandasack." That is the new keyword.

02:30:40.412 --> 02:30:42.665
MATT: It is. Boom.

02:30:42.665 --> 02:30:44.128
BRIAN: Write that down, Max.

02:30:44.128 --> 02:30:47.521
SAM: Ugh, I landed on my nuts!

02:30:47.521 --> 02:30:49.272
BRIAN: Wasn't that the idea?

02:30:49.272 --> 02:30:52.603
MATT: Good job, Peddy! All right, everyone. 
Down the tree. Come on.

02:30:52.603 --> 02:30:57.741
LIAM: Another dose of high art 
from Critical Role.

02:30:57.741 --> 02:31:04.133
TALIESIN: That's the most useful panda testicles
have been in a long time.

02:31:04.133 --> 02:31:06.266
I'm just going to point that out.

02:31:06.266 --> 02:31:14.174
MARISHA: (giggles) You quickly and as swiftly as
you can-- for a group of bears--

02:31:14.174 --> 02:31:18.522
climb down the tree and dart 
and make your way into the front room.

02:31:18.522 --> 02:31:21.590
SAM: I've got my stick. 
What do you want me to do?

02:31:21.590 --> 02:31:24.073
MATT: Make sure you don't leave it behind. 
Might be handy.

02:31:24.073 --> 02:31:28.197
SAM: I've got it. What do we do with this body?
Someone's going to see it!

02:31:28.197 --> 02:31:36.493
MARISHA: You get the Flyer, get it in. 
You are now into the front tavern bar room

02:31:36.493 --> 02:31:38.345
of the Sun Kissed Inn.

02:31:38.345 --> 02:31:44.729
MATT: A valid point. The body of the guy who's
unconscious that he just crushed. I pick up the

02:31:44.729 --> 02:31:52.084
body and look for the window of the balcony we
were just jumping down from and try and ragdoll

02:31:52.084 --> 02:31:59.362
him up into it. (laughing) Arms and legs out.

02:31:59.362 --> 02:32:01.985
LIAM: Full-on Red Dead Redemption.

02:32:01.985 --> 02:32:10.516
MARISHA: Bear? I guess? I don't know.

02:32:10.516 --> 02:32:13.979
BRIAN: That's totally something a bear would do.
Flinging a man through a window?

02:32:13.979 --> 02:32:16.855
MATT: That was a six.

02:32:16.855 --> 02:32:22.579
LIAM: His twisted pretzel body goes two miles,
floating five feet above the ground.

02:32:22.579 --> 02:32:34.751
MARISHA: You miss, and it goes and lands on the
roof of the storage room next door.

02:32:34.751 --> 02:32:36.400
MATT: Close enough.

02:32:36.400 --> 02:32:39.396
(laughter)

02:32:39.396 --> 02:32:47.001
MARISHA: It's not the most immediately visible
thing.

02:32:47.001 --> 02:32:48.815
TALIESIN: No one looks up.

02:32:48.815 --> 02:32:54.744
MATT: It's fine. Sweet dreams. Goes back to catch
up with them in the tavern.

02:32:54.744 --> 02:32:56.809
BRIAN: He won't remember that.

02:32:56.809 --> 02:33:10.647
MARISHA: You all are in the front room of the
tavern. It's the late afternoon. There's no one in

02:33:10.647 --> 02:33:20.059
the tavern, anyway, especially now. There's one
really old guy passed out in the front right-hand

02:33:20.059 --> 02:33:28.168
corner. Seems like he's been there probably since
last night. You hear a commotion and clanking of

02:33:28.168 --> 02:33:33.118
pots and pans of chefs and workers in the back, in
the kitchen, getting things ready for the evening,

02:33:33.118 --> 02:33:37.818
anticipating it will probably be a busy day in the
Hazel Festival.

02:33:37.818 --> 02:33:39.344
TALIESIN: Do I smell honey in the kitchen?

02:33:39.344 --> 02:33:42.091
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:33:42.091 --> 02:33:44.421
SAM: There's honey everywhere in this town.

02:33:44.421 --> 02:33:46.361
MARISHA: There is honey in there.

02:33:46.361 --> 02:33:50.732
MATT: You, with the strange crazy eyes. 
Do you have any idea where the cellar is

02:33:50.732 --> 02:33:52.536
here in the inn?

02:33:52.536 --> 02:34:02.819
MARISHA: It is drowned out by the smell of a
stockroom of honey that is coming from the back

02:34:02.819 --> 02:34:12.515
left-hand corner of the tavern, which is the
entrance to the pantry into the cellar. Guarding

02:34:12.515 --> 02:34:21.144
that front initial doorway into the pantry, which
leads into the bottom cellar, is, with a pint in

02:34:21.144 --> 02:34:24.492
his hand, a passed-out Grog.

02:34:24.492 --> 02:34:26.574
SAM: Grog Strongjaw?

02:34:26.574 --> 02:34:27.763
MARISHA: Grog.

02:34:27.763 --> 02:34:37.073
TALIESIN: The Grog Strongjaw, of the Northampton
Strongjaws? I don't know why I went there.

02:34:37.073 --> 02:34:43.836
MARISHA: The Herd. Technically of the Emon
Strongjaws?

02:34:43.836 --> 02:34:48.140
LIAM: If one of us bears made a history check,
would we know who the fuck this guy is?

02:34:48.140 --> 02:34:49.601
TALIESIN: He looks big.

02:34:49.601 --> 02:34:51.690
MARISHA: Trinket recognizes him immediately.

02:34:51.690 --> 02:34:59.859
SAM: I think I can-- excuse me, this is clearly a
panda bear. He's a skinnier version of me.

02:34:59.859 --> 02:35:05.088
He's black and white. And I will go talk to him 
in Panda, and I will sort this all out.

02:35:05.088 --> 02:35:10.643
MATT: While you're both probably on par
intellectually, I don't know

02:35:10.643 --> 02:35:12.104
if that's going to end as--

02:35:12.104 --> 02:35:16.649
SAM: He's furry. He's got a little fur. He's black
and white. He's my people.

02:35:16.649 --> 02:35:25.398
MATT: Is he right in front of the door to the
pantry?

02:35:25.398 --> 02:35:32.140
MARISHA: There's the bar, there's a door that goes
into the pantry, and then there's a little booth

02:35:32.140 --> 02:35:40.244
and bar tables right off to the left of the door.
Looks like he was placed there, probably told to

02:35:40.244 --> 02:35:46.762
watch out for people coming in and out of the
pantry, and proceeded to drink a lot and pass out

02:35:46.762 --> 02:35:52.494
instead. He's in a little chair, propped up at a
bar table right to the left of the entrance,

02:35:52.494 --> 02:35:55.528
snoring loudly. No what?

02:35:55.528 --> 02:35:56.809
BRIAN: There's cards?

02:35:56.809 --> 02:35:58.346
MARISHA: Cards? Oh!

02:35:58.346 --> 02:36:05.502
MATT: We're going to keep this as plan C. 
Plan A: quietly make our way past.

02:36:05.502 --> 02:36:09.191
TALIESIN: Quick question: which plan comes first?
Is it plan A or plan C?

02:36:09.191 --> 02:36:10.517
MATT: Brains?

02:36:10.517 --> 02:36:19.204
LIAM: I'm going to roll a d6, and I'll tell you.
Plan D comes first.

02:36:19.204 --> 02:36:20.930
TALIESIN: That makes sense.

02:36:20.930 --> 02:36:26.808
SAM: Why does no one value my opinions here?
I feel like I'm offering good ideas--

02:36:26.808 --> 02:36:33.500
BRIAN: When we need you to push something over, 
to dip your balls in something--

02:36:33.500 --> 02:36:37.660
SAM: I feel like I'm thinking outside the box
here, and no one's taking me seriously.

02:36:37.660 --> 02:36:42.131
LIAM: Peddy, you don't make friends with salad. 
No offense. Trinket, this is your home turf.

02:36:42.131 --> 02:36:43.753
I will follow your lead--

02:36:43.753 --> 02:36:45.000
TALIESIN: I don't know what that means!

02:36:45.000 --> 02:36:46.216
MARISHA: I don't, either!

02:36:46.216 --> 02:36:48.932
BRIAN: Vegetarian joke.

02:36:48.932 --> 02:36:51.425
LIAM: He's a vegetarian. All he eats is bamboo. 
No one's going to respect that

02:36:51.425 --> 02:36:52.941
in the bear community.

02:36:52.941 --> 02:36:57.659
BRIAN: While they're doing this, I would like to
go right outside the tavern and see if I can

02:36:57.659 --> 02:37:05.967
secure for us a getaway vehicle. Some type of mode
of transportation, faster than a de Rolo Roller.

02:37:05.967 --> 02:37:14.969
MARISHA: Sure. As you peek out, there's a few
abandoned vegetable carts. People that were there

02:37:14.969 --> 02:37:21.892
to sell their goods and their wares for the
festival. There's one that looks like it was a

02:37:21.937 --> 02:37:31.726
pull-behind churro cart. And there is one cart
that still has a horse attached to it that looks

02:37:31.795 --> 02:37:36.688
like at this point, he's eating all of the
vegetables that are completely unattended

02:37:36.688 --> 02:37:38.450
right now, due to the pandemonium.

02:37:38.450 --> 02:37:43.093
BRIAN: So there's no one around it? 
I will go secure that cart and bring it

02:37:43.093 --> 02:37:44.570
to the entrance of the tavern.

02:37:44.570 --> 02:37:46.056
MARISHA: Okay. How would you like to do that?

02:37:46.056 --> 02:37:49.888
BRIAN: Am I still dressed up as a fucking
awesome-looking guy?

02:37:49.888 --> 02:37:52.128
Like a young Jason Charles Miller?

02:37:52.128 --> 02:37:54.862
MARISHA: Yeah. You totally look like a young Jason
Charles Miller.

02:37:54.862 --> 02:37:58.319
TALIESIN: Does that mean that a young 
Jason Charles Miller looks like a honey badger

02:37:58.319 --> 02:37:59.504
in a cowboy hat?

02:37:59.504 --> 02:38:00.654
BRIAN: It sure does.

02:38:00.654 --> 02:38:03.523
LIAM: I'm picturing a furry Great American Hero.

02:38:03.523 --> 02:38:19.507
BRIAN: Yes! So I will cross the thoroughfare as
suavely and slovenly as I can, and then I will

02:38:19.507 --> 02:38:23.331
approach the cart from the back so as not to
frighten the horse.

02:38:23.331 --> 02:38:27.998
MARISHA: Okay. You see the same guard that was
walking by is currently pounding on the door.

02:38:27.998 --> 02:38:34.417
You can hear him. On the door that you guys came
from that led up to the security room. You can

02:38:34.417 --> 02:38:39.496
hear him going, "Chief? Boss man? Hello?"

02:38:39.496 --> 02:38:48.690
BRIAN: How far away from me is he?

02:38:48.690 --> 02:38:52.774
MARISHA: The guy? He's far enough away. He's not
paying any attention to you right now.

02:38:52.774 --> 02:38:55.292
BRIAN: Does it look like he wants to go in there?

02:38:55.292 --> 02:38:57.211
MARISHA: He's trying to get in, yeah.

02:38:57.211 --> 02:39:02.736
BRIAN: All right. I'm going to go try to cut his
throat.

02:39:02.736 --> 02:39:05.250
SAM: With what? With your claws?

02:39:05.250 --> 02:39:10.663
BRIAN: I'm a fucking honey badger, bro. I'm going
to try to go from behind and silence him.

02:39:10.663 --> 02:39:14.213
Yeah, man, put him in the cement boots.

02:39:14.213 --> 02:39:18.222
MARISHA: That's fucking awesome. Roll for carnage.
You get advantage.

02:39:18.222 --> 02:39:22.828
BRIAN: Success.

02:39:22.828 --> 02:39:29.957
MARISHA: Without any hesitation, he doesn't even
know what came.

02:39:29.957 --> 02:39:33.540
BRIAN: The honey's for me and my friends.

02:39:33.540 --> 02:39:43.615
MARISHA: A theatrical amount of blood sprays on
the door in front, and he slowly drops, smears

02:39:43.615 --> 02:39:47.404
down against the wall. He's dead.

02:39:47.404 --> 02:39:48.888
BRIAN: Oh shit, he's dead?

02:39:48.888 --> 02:39:50.173
MARISHA: He's definitely dead.

02:39:50.173 --> 02:39:54.536
BRIAN: On the wall in the blood, I write, 
&lt;i&gt;Welcome to fabulous Las Vegas.&lt;/i&gt;

02:39:54.536 --> 02:39:59.648
(laughter)

02:39:59.648 --> 02:40:01.621
MARISHA: Roll for criminal.

02:40:01.621 --> 02:40:06.004
BRIAN: Again? Success.

02:40:06.004 --> 02:40:08.942
MARISHA: You get a point from bear into criminal,
for sure.

02:40:09.003 --> 02:40:15.612
LIAM: My criminal mastermind brain tells me that
this is your turf, Trink. I want to follow your

02:40:15.612 --> 02:40:19.065
lead. I see recognition in your eyes. You don't
like this guy. What do we do?

02:40:19.065 --> 02:40:26.597
MATT: No, I like the guy a lot, actually, but he
might like destroying you too much. We've got to

02:40:26.597 --> 02:40:30.150
sneak past. Stay nice and quiet-like. Small guy
can probably get by fine when he catches up, but

02:40:30.150 --> 02:40:32.177
we've got to quietly make our way.

02:40:32.177 --> 02:40:34.747
TALIESIN: Is it a door or a gate? Can we see
past?

02:40:34.747 --> 02:40:44.463
MARISHA: You know those stockrooms, how you have
an open half-door? You can see that there's a

02:40:44.463 --> 02:40:52.962
walk-in pantry, and through the walk-in pantry,
there's a little cellar door. Wooden. It's got a

02:40:52.962 --> 02:40:55.834
circular dowel rod across it.

02:40:55.834 --> 02:40:57.346
TALIESIN: I can't see any honey?

02:40:57.346 --> 02:40:59.992
MARISHA: No, but you know it's through that door.

02:40:59.992 --> 02:41:02.054
TALIESIN: I've got an idea.

02:41:02.054 --> 02:41:05.356
SAM: I've got an idea. That dowel rod looks like
bamboo. I'm going to eat it!

02:41:05.356 --> 02:41:08.422
TALIESIN: You've got a tiny bottle of honey.

02:41:08.422 --> 02:41:13.612
MARISHA: You can also smell a little bit of honey
coming from the pantry room, as well. Not a lot.

02:41:13.612 --> 02:41:20.309
TALIESIN: You've got a tiny bottle of honey,
right? Wasn't someone given a teeny-tiny

02:41:20.309 --> 02:41:21.357
bit of honey?

02:41:21.357 --> 02:41:22.606
SAM: He's got armpit honey.

02:41:22.606 --> 02:41:28.503
BRIAN: I've got it, but I'm not there yet. But
after I so beautifully and poetically murdered

02:41:28.503 --> 02:41:32.401
that man in the street, can I move the cart to the
front of the tavern and rejoin them?

02:41:32.401 --> 02:41:39.021
MARISHA: You can go over and take a little bit of
time, get some leftover vegetables, and lead the

02:41:39.021 --> 02:41:45.425
horse, pulling the cart. These guys are figuring
this out while you're doing that.

02:41:45.425 --> 02:41:55.246
MATT: I pull out a palm-full of pit honey that's
been smeared into my matted fur. I've got this.

02:41:55.246 --> 02:42:01.648
TALIESIN: It'll do. I'm going to look around. Are
there cups or something around?

02:42:01.648 --> 02:42:07.304
MARISHA: Yeah, there's a few, and there's a couple
of empty pint glasses on Grog's table.

02:42:07.304 --> 02:42:10.358
TALIESIN: I put a little bit of the honey into the
empty pint.

02:42:10.358 --> 02:42:14.689
MARISHA: (snores) "Yes, I am the Grand Poobah."

02:42:14.689 --> 02:42:20.387
TALIESIN: I'm going to try and toss the cup past
Grog into the pantry.

02:42:20.387 --> 02:42:22.266
SAM: To wake him up?

02:42:22.266 --> 02:42:23.453
TALIESIN: Quietly.

02:42:23.453 --> 02:42:24.878
MARISHA: You want to wake him up?

02:42:24.878 --> 02:42:29.062
TALIESIN: No, I want to throw the cup into the
pantry. Will that wake him up?

02:42:29.062 --> 02:42:34.365
MARISHA: Okay, you throw a cup. (crash, snorts)
"That's my ale."

02:42:34.365 --> 02:42:41.250
TALIESIN: I'm going to stare at the cup I just
threw.

02:42:41.250 --> 02:42:55.107
MARISHA: About this time, Waffle gets another
little nosebleed. Roll for it.

02:42:55.107 --> 02:42:57.128
TALIESIN: I don't get advantage, I just have to
roll for it, right?

02:42:57.128 --> 02:42:59.855
LIAM: Come on, Bear Eleven.

02:42:59.855 --> 02:43:01.763
TALIESIN: One.

02:43:01.763 --> 02:43:10.937
MARISHA: You see Waffle go, (sparking) and in a
hex techy-looking glow, he goes, (zap)

02:43:10.937 --> 02:43:13.147
and teleports to the broken honey.

02:43:13.147 --> 02:43:15.022
LIAM: In the pantry?

02:43:15.022 --> 02:43:16.288
MARISHA: In the pantry.

02:43:16.288 --> 02:43:21.584
MATT: All right, my turn. I focus really hard on
the broken honey--

02:43:21.584 --> 02:43:24.139
SAM: No, you need a nosebleed. I hit him in the
nose.

02:43:24.139 --> 02:43:30.132
MATT: That's good. (straining)

02:43:30.132 --> 02:43:33.735
SAM: More blood!

02:43:33.735 --> 02:43:37.284
MATT: Okay.

02:43:37.284 --> 02:43:40.538
MARISHA: You go (boop) and squeeze out a little
turd.

02:43:40.538 --> 02:43:46.293
SAM: Hey, you teleported that turd to the floor.

02:43:46.293 --> 02:43:52.177
MARISHA: As you get a little aggravated, you take
a point in bear.

02:43:52.177 --> 02:43:58.646
TALIESIN: I'm going to start figuring out if I can
open this pantry door. I'm quietly working the

02:43:58.646 --> 02:44:00.418
pantry door to try and get downstairs.

02:44:00.418 --> 02:44:06.560
MARISHA: It's got a thick dowel rod across it, and
it's got a chain on top of that, wrapping it up

02:44:06.560 --> 02:44:08.063
for extra security.

02:44:08.063 --> 02:44:09.749
TALIESIN: I didn't think much past this.

02:44:09.749 --> 02:44:15.837
LIAM: Hold on, I've got this. I'm going to pick
this chain's lock.

02:44:15.837 --> 02:44:26.937
MATT: We haven't walked past Grog yet, but you
know what? Our conversation hasn't woken him up

02:44:26.937 --> 02:44:31.892
yet, and the breaking glass didn't wake him up.
Let's just walk through the room. He's pretty

02:44:31.892 --> 02:44:34.175
drunk. All right, let's do that.

02:44:34.175 --> 02:44:37.618
MARISHA: Yeah, make a stealthy...

02:44:37.618 --> 02:44:45.511
MATT: Because I'm a thief, could I consider that
as a skill?

02:44:45.511 --> 02:44:48.032
TALIESIN: Considering that bears can have very
stealthy picnics--

02:44:48.032 --> 02:44:52.784
MARISHA: Let's make this a criminal roll. You're
criminally trying to sneak past Grog.

02:44:52.784 --> 02:44:54.601
LIAM: Welcome to Criminal Roll!

02:44:54.601 --> 02:44:57.150
MATT: Can I use my thief role to be stealthy?

02:44:57.150 --> 02:44:59.018
MARISHA: Yeah. I'll allow it.

02:44:59.018 --> 02:45:03.295
SAM: On the way past, I'm going to look 
and see if Grog has anything else on him

02:45:03.295 --> 02:45:05.914
that we can see or take or use.

02:45:05.914 --> 02:45:20.647
MARISHA: He does actually appear to be wearing
some sunglasses. Yeah. It seems a little odd. They

02:45:20.647 --> 02:45:26.670
look like they were maybe festival glasses.
They're half hanging off his face right now.

02:45:26.670 --> 02:45:28.213
SAM: I'll see if I can take them.

02:45:28.213 --> 02:45:30.016
MARISHA: Okay, roll a criminal check.

02:45:30.016 --> 02:45:32.458
SAM: Super fail.

02:45:32.458 --> 02:45:37.421
BRIAN and MATT: (singing) Super fail, super fail.

02:45:37.421 --> 02:45:38.911
MATT: (singing) He super fucked up.

02:45:38.911 --> 02:45:51.298
MARISHA: As you get the glasses off his face, 
he goes, "Oh shit. It's a fuzzy goliath!"

02:45:51.298 --> 02:45:54.188
And gets up.

02:45:54.188 --> 02:45:55.773
SAM: I growl at him. (roars)

02:45:55.773 --> 02:45:56.870
MARISHA: (roars) He growls back.

02:45:56.870 --> 02:46:00.702
SAM and MARISHA: (roar)

02:46:00.702 --> 02:46:02.296
MARISHA: "You want to wrestle?"

02:46:02.296 --> 02:46:03.666
SAM: Yeah!

02:46:03.666 --> 02:46:08.260
MARISHA: He's drunk, and he takes a big swing at
you.

02:46:08.260 --> 02:46:10.683
SAM: I swing back.

02:46:10.683 --> 02:46:15.892
MARISHA: Okay, roll a muscle roll. Roll with
advantage.

02:46:15.892 --> 02:46:19.832
SAM: Fail. Success!

02:46:19.832 --> 02:46:26.259
MARISHA: You successfully wrestle Grog. He's
pretty drunk. He's not too hard to get to the

02:46:26.259 --> 02:46:29.689
ground. He's now on his back, squirming.

02:46:29.689 --> 02:46:38.046
SAM: I speak to him in Panda: pan pan pan-pan. 
Pan pan pan pan? Pan pan da da da,

02:46:38.046 --> 02:46:40.792
pa-pa-pan pan dan. Panda.

02:46:40.792 --> 02:46:45.890
MARISHA: "Yes, I am Grand Poobah 
de Boink de Boink!"

02:46:45.890 --> 02:46:47.624
SAM: Panda?

02:46:47.624 --> 02:46:50.262
MARISHA: "You Poobah, too?"

02:46:50.262 --> 02:46:51.603
SAM: Panda!

02:46:51.603 --> 02:46:56.183
MARISHA: "Oh, brother!"

02:46:56.183 --> 02:46:59.725
(fake sobbing)

02:46:59.725 --> 02:47:02.511
LIAM: Cookie is picking the fuck out of the lock,
right now!

02:47:02.511 --> 02:47:04.239
MARISHA: Try to pick the lock.

02:47:04.239 --> 02:47:07.438
LIAM: Diddly-diddly-do! That is a fail.

02:47:07.438 --> 02:47:13.472
BRIAN: How is my progress 
of leading a horse across the street, slowly,

02:47:13.472 --> 02:47:15.500
by luring him with vegetables?

02:47:15.500 --> 02:47:24.171
MARISHA: Pretty good. I'd say by this point, you
open the door to see Peddy on top of another guy

02:47:24.171 --> 02:47:28.160
that looks kind of like a panda, and you're not
sure if it's bad or good.

02:47:28.160 --> 02:47:33.232
LIAM: Marisha, what does the flashback do? If I
tell a flashback, it fixes that?

02:47:33.232 --> 02:47:37.706
MARISHA: If you tell a flashback, you get to gain
a point into criminal.

02:47:37.706 --> 02:47:40.000
LIAM: And then roll again?

02:47:40.000 --> 02:47:44.657
MATT: No, it just adjusts your skill points. You
still fail the roll.

02:47:44.657 --> 02:47:46.352
LIAM: All right.

02:47:46.352 --> 02:47:49.474
TALIESIN: I've got a plan to get us in this door.

02:47:49.474 --> 02:47:55.965
MATT: What, are you having a problem again trying
to get into a place with a lock? Like I said, the

02:47:55.965 --> 02:48:01.896
lady who raised me, she's pretty good at picking
this stuff, too. In fact-- and I reach over and

02:48:01.896 --> 02:48:05.987
grab one of the little side bags they usually tie
to me to carry stuff, and I pull out one of the

02:48:05.987 --> 02:48:12.934
lockpicks that Vex keeps stored on my side as a
backup. And with my dexterous thief Trinket giant

02:48:12.934 --> 02:48:16.838
bear paws, try and maneuver these tiny little--

02:48:16.838 --> 02:48:19.387
LIAM: Thin as a blade of grass.

02:48:19.387 --> 02:48:26.790
MATT: It's like trying to hold a cup with boxing
gloves on. (grunts)

02:48:26.790 --> 02:48:31.696
MARISHA: Countless hours, you have practiced in
the middle of the night, just trying to learn how

02:48:31.696 --> 02:48:35.294
to pick a lock. Prove to us, Trinket, 
that you can.

02:48:35.294 --> 02:48:36.721
MATT: Yes!

02:48:36.721 --> 02:48:46.423
MARISHA: (clang) The whole thing snaps from the
inside, because you're a bear, but it successfully

02:48:46.423 --> 02:48:48.037
goes (creak).

02:48:48.037 --> 02:48:52.425
MATT: What did I tell you? Mommy taught me good.

02:48:52.425 --> 02:49:04.947
MARISHA: About this time, Grog goes, "Poobah, I
missed you so--" (snores) and passes back out.

02:49:04.947 --> 02:49:08.384
SAM: I put his sunglasses back on and pat him on
the head.

02:49:08.384 --> 02:49:15.465
MARISHA: All right. You do get an interesting
essence from the sunglasses.

02:49:15.465 --> 02:49:20.146
SAM: Oh? Do they have the same essence as the
stick, or something similar?

02:49:20.146 --> 02:49:21.781
LIAM: Put them on your face, Peddy.

02:49:21.781 --> 02:49:31.701
SAM: All right, I'll take them and put them on.
Try them on once. (giggles) Nice. I'm going to try

02:49:31.701 --> 02:49:33.918
them on once. What do I see?

02:49:33.918 --> 02:49:45.438
MARISHA: You look awesome. You see a bar, 
you see a tavern, and then right as you look past

02:49:45.438 --> 02:49:51.109
the cellar: holy shit, you can see past that 
cellar door! You see tripwires!

02:49:51.109 --> 02:49:52.812
SAM: What?

02:49:52.812 --> 02:49:54.203
LIAM: Peddy, what are you doing?

02:49:54.203 --> 02:50:00.224
SAM: I put on these human glasses, and I can see
through walls.

02:50:00.224 --> 02:50:02.880
BRIAN: And all you had to do was dry-hump that guy
to get them?

02:50:02.880 --> 02:50:04.293
SAM: I was not dry-humping him!

02:50:04.293 --> 02:50:06.494
BRIAN: It looked like you were dry-humping him
when I walked in here.

02:50:06.494 --> 02:50:07.964
LIAM: You can now, if you choose to.

02:50:07.964 --> 02:50:11.917
SAM: Dry-hump him? No.

02:50:11.917 --> 02:50:19.886
MARISHA: You turn and look over your shoulder
outside, out through the tavern exit, and you see

02:50:19.886 --> 02:50:25.477
a dwarf-sized woman turn and swing open the door
of the tavern.

02:50:25.477 --> 02:50:26.999
TALIESIN: We've got to move.

02:50:26.999 --> 02:50:31.081
MARISHA: "Hey! I see you."

02:50:31.081 --> 02:50:34.287
LIAM: Nobody move.

02:50:34.287 --> 02:50:36.892
SAM: Humans can't see movement.

02:50:36.892 --> 02:50:43.687
MARISHA: "I can see you, and I can understand 
what you're saying."

02:50:43.687 --> 02:50:45.270
MATT: Wait, what?

02:50:45.270 --> 02:50:46.413
BRIAN: But I didn't say anything.

02:50:46.413 --> 02:50:48.527
TALIESIN: What number am I thinking of?

02:50:48.527 --> 02:50:50.707
MARISHA: "I can hear you. I can't--"

02:50:50.707 --> 02:50:52.503
TALIESIN: She can't hear us; it's fine.

02:50:52.503 --> 02:50:57.820
SAM: Wait, humans can't see movement, but dwarves
can, I guess.

02:50:57.820 --> 02:51:02.254
MARISHA: "That's not-- okay, what are you all
doing, all right?"

02:51:02.254 --> 02:51:06.644
MATT: I go over. Do these still look functional?

02:51:06.644 --> 02:51:13.332
MARISHA: "Where did you-- wait a second."

02:51:13.332 --> 02:51:15.033
MATT: Do I recognize this?

02:51:15.033 --> 02:51:20.198
MARISHA: You do. This is Tova, the werebear.

02:51:20.198 --> 02:51:23.848
MATT: (moans)

02:51:23.848 --> 02:51:26.516
MARISHA: "Okay. All right, big guy. All right."

02:51:26.516 --> 02:51:31.170
LIAM: This is two years after the Chroma Conclave?
She lived!

02:51:31.170 --> 02:51:36.076
MARISHA: This is the first time that you're seeing
her.

02:51:36.076 --> 02:51:39.028
MATT: The only reason was because of that ring.

02:51:39.028 --> 02:51:41.916
LIAM: (cheers)

02:51:41.916 --> 02:51:49.968
MARISHA: She's wearing a nice slick suit. It's
very good. It's very clean-cut. Looks like she's

02:51:49.968 --> 02:51:52.197
got a nice festive pin.

02:51:52.197 --> 02:51:53.504
BRIAN: Is it all denim?

02:51:53.504 --> 02:51:56.371
MARISHA: No, it's a nice wool. It's good.

02:51:56.371 --> 02:51:58.194
MATT: You look good, Tova. Snazzy.

02:51:58.194 --> 02:52:06.204
MARISHA: "You look good, too, Trinket. 
What do you think you're doing?"

02:52:06.204 --> 02:52:09.092
MATT: It's a celebration in the city. We're
celebrating.

02:52:09.092 --> 02:52:12.282
MARISHA: "I heard rumor that there's 
a bunch of bears running around.

02:52:12.282 --> 02:52:13.945
"Of course it's Vex's dumb bear."

02:52:13.945 --> 02:52:14.979
MATT: Hey!

02:52:14.979 --> 02:52:21.836
MARISHA: "Well, look. What kind of trouble are you
getting into? You guys are going for the honey."

02:52:21.836 --> 02:52:27.534
MATT: I mean, that's absurd. I'm offended,
personally.

02:52:27.534 --> 02:52:29.683
BRIAN: To judge without any evidence.

02:52:29.683 --> 02:52:33.068
MATT: Do you want a cut?

02:52:33.068 --> 02:52:35.348
LIAM: Yeah, but just pretend like we were. 
Do you want in?

02:52:35.348 --> 02:52:43.630
MARISHA: "Do I want-- (laughs) All right. 
You all clearly don't know who you're talking to

02:52:43.630 --> 02:52:46.446
"and who you're getting involved with."

02:52:46.446 --> 02:52:49.406
BRIAN: You just walked in five seconds ago.

02:52:49.406 --> 02:52:56.676
MATT: I barely know you. We flirted in battle once,
and then you went away.

02:52:56.676 --> 02:53:01.620
MARISHA: "All right, look! I am part 
of a super-secret society that is dedicated

02:53:01.620 --> 02:53:06.697
"to protecting bears all across Tal'Dorei. 
One of the most decorated members.

02:53:06.697 --> 02:53:12.107
"It's called the High Bear Nation, all right?" 
It's not bad, right?

02:53:12.107 --> 02:53:19.332
"We take honey and other fruits and vegetables,
steal them from people who don't really need them,

02:53:19.332 --> 02:53:22.948
"and make sure that bear families 
across all of Tal'Dorei are taken care of

02:53:22.948 --> 02:53:24.753
"and never go without honey.

02:53:24.753 --> 02:53:32.299
"Every year, this stupid Hazel Festival that they
always make me work security for, I decided

02:53:32.299 --> 02:53:37.616
"I'm going to take all this leftover food 
that all these people always end up with:

02:53:37.616 --> 02:53:42.567
"I'm going to take it for High Bear Nation. 
Give it to the bears who truly need it."

02:53:42.567 --> 02:53:45.791
SAM: Wait a second, you're going to take all this
honey and give it away?

02:53:45.791 --> 02:53:49.762
BRIAN: Give it away to a bunch of people that are
too lazy to get jobs?

02:53:49.762 --> 02:53:51.566
LIAM: Don't we look needy?

02:53:51.566 --> 02:53:57.227
MARISHA: "No, look. These are needy people, and
the High Bear Nation takes care of all of us,

02:53:57.227 --> 02:54:00.038
"all right? I will get plenty of honey out of this."

02:54:00.038 --> 02:54:05.801
MATT: All right, Beary Sanders. That honey is
for us and us alone. We've earned that, okay?

02:54:05.801 --> 02:54:09.291
I don't want bears that haven't earned it 
getting a piece of what we've made.

02:54:09.291 --> 02:54:12.890
LIAM: Yeah, are you pulling our legs? What is
this, a gingerhazing?

02:54:12.890 --> 02:54:21.246
MARISHA: "You all put in work for this? I don't
think you guys understand. I was part of

02:54:21.246 --> 02:54:25.832
"the planning committee to make sure 
that the security was all right.

02:54:25.832 --> 02:54:33.227
"So here's the deal, since you all seem to have
gotten pretty far. The whole town's out looking

02:54:33.227 --> 02:54:40.205
"for you; I can easily call one of the guards, 
turn you all in right now. Or you help me out.

02:54:40.205 --> 02:54:43.980
"I could use extra hands to carry out 
some of this honey.

02:54:43.980 --> 02:54:49.844
"You'll get your own little cut, and you'll all 
become members of the High Bear Nation."

02:54:49.844 --> 02:54:51.940
SAM: What kind of cut are you talking about here?

02:54:51.940 --> 02:54:55.976
MARISHA: "Enough to last you for a while. I know
how much honey is in there."

02:54:55.976 --> 02:54:59.887
SAM: 50-50? 40-40? 30-30?

02:54:59.887 --> 02:55:02.130
MARISHA: "That's not how--"

02:55:02.130 --> 02:55:04.105
SAM: I'm not the brains of the operation.

02:55:04.105 --> 02:55:07.836
(laughter)

02:55:07.836 --> 02:55:12.838
MARISHA: "A good hogshead's worth for each of you.
How's that sound?"

02:55:12.838 --> 02:55:15.516
BRIAN: Listen, from one extremely high bear to
another--

02:55:15.516 --> 02:55:28.347
(laughter)

02:55:28.347 --> 02:55:36.416
BRIAN: Can you guarantee safe passage, should we
choose to work with you in this endeavor?

02:55:36.416 --> 02:55:38.909
SAM: It's always Bear-20 somewhere.

02:55:38.909 --> 02:55:48.509
(snickering)

02:55:48.509 --> 02:55:51.504
BRIAN: Oh, my makeup's running, and I didn't even
put any on.

02:55:51.504 --> 02:55:53.536
MATT: Can you give us a minute to talk amongst
ourselves, privately?

02:55:53.536 --> 02:55:57.241
MARISHA: "All right."

02:55:57.241 --> 02:56:00.831
MATT: All right. Bears, huddle up.

02:56:00.831 --> 02:56:03.247
BRIAN: I think she likes me for sure.

02:56:03.247 --> 02:56:07.464
MATT: All right, what are our thoughts on this. Do
we want to share with her? We put all the work in.

02:56:07.464 --> 02:56:10.458
It's not a lot of honey. We barely found that off
your--

02:56:10.458 --> 02:56:13.539
LIAM: We already got a hogshead of honey in his
hat.

02:56:13.539 --> 02:56:17.509
MATT: That'll last a meal. I don't think she
understands how hungry we are.

02:56:17.509 --> 02:56:19.729
BRIAN: Yeah, and that one's big.

02:56:19.729 --> 02:56:22.295
MATT: That one only eats bamboo.

02:56:22.295 --> 02:56:27.967
BRIAN: Yeah, but should he switch and start to eat
honey, he could consume much of it.

02:56:27.967 --> 02:56:32.566
SAM: I don't really care about the honey one way
or the other. Honestly, I'm fine just eating

02:56:32.566 --> 02:56:38.342
bamboo, but I do feel like we put in the effort.
This is our heist. It's not hers. If she wants

02:56:38.342 --> 02:56:43.984
to get cut in, we could give her maybe 
a thousand percent. I don't know numbers,

02:56:43.984 --> 02:56:46.191
but a small amount.

02:56:46.191 --> 02:56:50.039
MATT: I could always say, there's five of us 
and one of her.

02:56:50.039 --> 02:56:52.482
If she helps us make our way in there--

02:56:52.482 --> 02:56:54.822
BRIAN: I cut her throat--

02:56:54.822 --> 02:56:59.293
MATT: Trust me, I've seen a lot of battles, 
and I haven't fallen in a single one.

02:56:59.293 --> 02:57:03.910
(laughter)

02:57:03.910 --> 02:57:09.667
MATT: We can take her, no problem. We leave her
tied up. Leave her a little hogshead of honey she

02:57:09.667 --> 02:57:13.829
can take back to her bear friends, and then we
walk away scot-free.

02:57:13.829 --> 02:57:17.657
SAM: As a vegan, I'm going to protest that we not
harm any living creatures.

02:57:17.657 --> 02:57:21.384
MATT: Not harm, just knock unconscious and tie up,
like you've done to every other thing

02:57:21.384 --> 02:57:22.492
we've come across.

02:57:22.492 --> 02:57:27.137
SAM: That's okay. That is not harm. 
But heavens forbid we actually

02:57:27.137 --> 02:57:29.237
kill a human being on this adventure.

02:57:29.237 --> 02:57:32.904
MATT: Oh god, no. Unless they're evil or an
asshole or hurt my mom.

02:57:32.904 --> 02:57:36.071
BRIAN: I did kill a human person, though.

02:57:36.071 --> 02:57:39.086
SAM: Can you flash us back to that incident?

02:57:39.086 --> 02:57:47.171
BRIAN: Well, it was 24 minutes ago, and I slit 
the throat of an innocent douchebag

02:57:47.171 --> 02:57:48.969
who was knocking too loud.

02:57:48.969 --> 02:57:51.787
SAM: Why would you kill an innocent person?

02:57:51.787 --> 02:57:56.918
BRIAN: He nearly discovered all of you, and I
killed him.

02:57:56.918 --> 02:57:59.105
SAM: I can't believe you. You're heartless.

02:57:59.105 --> 02:58:09.749
BRIAN: I do what it takes. Everything I do, I do
it for the squad. Oh my god.

02:58:09.749 --> 02:58:15.178
MARISHA: You get to put a point back into criminal
for that. From bear to criminal.

02:58:15.178 --> 02:58:16.571
BRIAN: Me?

02:58:16.571 --> 02:58:22.311
MATT: Are we agreed? Move forward as the squad,
tag her along, and then when all's said and done,

02:58:22.311 --> 02:58:26.122
leave her behind with a bit of honey, and we move
away with the lion's share.

02:58:26.122 --> 02:58:28.189
TALIESIN: Works for me.

02:58:28.189 --> 02:58:34.205
MATT: All right, break! Tova, you've got yourself
a deal.

02:58:34.205 --> 02:58:39.280
MARISHA: "Yeah? You an honest bear?"

02:58:39.280 --> 02:58:41.568
MATT: Do I look like an honest bear?

02:58:41.568 --> 02:58:43.437
MARISHA: "No."

02:58:43.437 --> 02:58:45.945
BRIAN: Do I look like an honest bear?

02:58:45.945 --> 02:58:48.729
MARISHA: "You look like a honey badger."

02:58:48.729 --> 02:58:53.943
MATT: All right.

02:58:53.943 --> 02:58:57.507
MARISHA: "Here's the deal: we're going to go
through these doors. There's going to be three

02:58:57.507 --> 02:59:04.349
"tripwires. That's what they're called: tripwires.
There's also going to be a security cam in here.

02:59:04.349 --> 02:59:06.596
"We want to be careful. They're watching us."

02:59:06.596 --> 02:59:10.163
SAM: They're not watching us anymore.

02:59:10.163 --> 02:59:13.347
TALIESIN: We've already taken care of the security
camera.

02:59:13.347 --> 02:59:19.676
MARISHA: "Wow, that's pretty impressive. All
right, you guys are pretty good criminal bears.

02:59:19.676 --> 02:59:23.854
"All right, these tripwires, though. Anyone good
at disarming? Yeah, we'll figure it out when we

02:59:23.854 --> 02:59:34.048
"get in. Let's go." You throw open the door and
see a long hallway. Three haphazardly across the

02:59:34.048 --> 02:59:40.050
hall tripwires. They're long, cylindrical,
glowing a bit green. You take a little bit of

02:59:40.050 --> 02:59:51.667
dust, Liam Las Vegas, and they show up a little
bit better, then they go back to their dull,

02:59:51.667 --> 02:59:55.722
transparent look, like fishing wire.

02:59:55.722 --> 02:59:58.209
BRIAN: I don't like this one bit.

02:59:58.209 --> 03:00:03.678
MATT: Does this look like the kind of thing that a
thief-trained bear who has seen thieves do their

03:00:03.678 --> 03:00:06.373
work would have an inkling of how to disable it?

03:00:06.373 --> 03:00:10.185
MARISHA: You can certainly try.

03:00:10.185 --> 03:00:13.581
BRIAN: That sounds so familiar.

03:00:13.581 --> 03:00:18.872
MARISHA: I tried to think up bear puns 
for all of our sayings, and I couldn't find

03:00:18.872 --> 03:00:20.460
any natural ones.

03:00:20.460 --> 03:00:23.082
MATT: The internet will barrage us with them when
we're done.

03:00:23.082 --> 03:00:24.437
BRIAN: There's going to be a lot, yeah.

03:00:24.437 --> 03:00:26.344
TALIESIN: There will be nothing on Twitter other
than bear puns.

03:00:26.344 --> 03:00:30.480
MATT: I go back into the bag of thieves' tools
left over from Vex and pull out what I think might

03:00:30.480 --> 03:00:37.290
work. I take a look at the mechanisms for the trip
wire. Two and a one.

03:00:37.290 --> 03:00:43.890
MARISHA: Nice. Okay, you go up to the first one,
and you see an energy box off to the side. It's

03:00:43.890 --> 03:00:53.383
got a washer keeping it closed. You tilt that to
the side, see the mechanical mechanism

03:00:53.383 --> 03:00:59.317
on the inside. (pop)

03:00:59.317 --> 03:01:04.565
MATT: I turn around with a big goofy smile.

03:01:04.565 --> 03:01:09.357
MARISHA: You got through tripwire one. Two more
to go.

03:01:09.357 --> 03:01:11.411
LIAM: Arcane magic dispelled.

03:01:11.411 --> 03:01:17.959
MATT: Anyone have anything else they could help me
with on this?

03:01:17.959 --> 03:01:20.814
SAM: I can grow a tree.

03:01:20.814 --> 03:01:29.643
LIAM: Hold on. I walk up to it carefully,
gingerly, slowly. I piddle on it.

03:01:29.643 --> 03:01:32.661
MARISHA: (sizzling)

03:01:32.661 --> 03:01:35.008
TALIESIN: That's some hot pee, man.

03:01:35.008 --> 03:01:38.744
LIAM: Nothing? I piddle on it again.

03:01:38.744 --> 03:01:41.032
MARISHA: (weak sizzling)

03:01:41.032 --> 03:01:43.150
LIAM: I really thought that would work.

03:01:43.150 --> 03:01:44.952
SAM: Can't you hack this?

03:01:44.952 --> 03:01:51.345
TALIESIN: I don't know. It looks a little weird. 
I can try and hack it.

03:01:51.345 --> 03:01:53.756
MARISHA: You can try and hack it.

03:01:53.756 --> 03:01:54.948
TALIESIN: I'm going to try and hack one.

03:01:54.948 --> 03:01:57.456
MARISHA: All right, roll two.

03:01:57.456 --> 03:02:01.763
MATT: Don't hack! You're going to be hacking an
actual tripwire.

03:02:01.763 --> 03:02:05.216
TALIESIN: One.

03:02:05.216 --> 03:02:13.003
MARISHA: It's got a little box. You go in. Instead
of messing with the mechanical trip wire, you see

03:02:13.003 --> 03:02:15.293
almost a microchip on the inside.

03:02:15.293 --> 03:02:17.638
TALIESIN: Can I find an off switch and click it?

03:02:17.638 --> 03:02:20.311
MARISHA: You touch it, and it goes (zap).

03:02:20.311 --> 03:02:21.725
TALIESIN: Hacked it.

03:02:21.725 --> 03:02:23.113
SAM: Wow.

03:02:23.113 --> 03:02:24.953
MARISHA: One more.

03:02:24.953 --> 03:02:30.681
MATT: All right, I'll try for the third one. 
Get behind me. If anything goes bad,

03:02:30.681 --> 03:02:33.744
tell Vex I love her.

03:02:33.744 --> 03:02:37.355
BRIAN: But if it goes right, do the grin. 
We like that.

03:02:37.355 --> 03:02:38.504
SAM: Who's Vax?

03:02:38.504 --> 03:02:39.849
LIAM: Or Vex?

03:02:39.849 --> 03:02:41.230
BRIAN: Who's Vax?

03:02:41.230 --> 03:02:43.803
SAM: No, he said Vax. I think he wants us to tell
Vax--

03:02:43.803 --> 03:02:45.971
BRIAN: We'll tell Vax that you love her.

03:02:45.971 --> 03:02:55.130
MATT: Three.

03:02:55.130 --> 03:02:59.957
MARISHA: All right. You and you take points in
criminal.

03:02:59.957 --> 03:03:03.602
MATT: I turn around and look at the group with a
terrible happy-bear smile.

03:03:03.602 --> 03:03:05.752
BRIAN: Yeah.

03:03:05.752 --> 03:03:12.688
MARISHA: Tova's like, "All right. Good work." You
get down to the other end of the hall.

03:03:12.688 --> 03:03:16.356
SAM: As we walk, I'm going to whisper to-- 
what's his name?

03:03:16.356 --> 03:03:18.102
LIAM and TALIESIN: Cookie.

03:03:18.102 --> 03:03:23.507
SAM: Hey, Cookie. I'm getting a bad feeling 
about this Tova chick.

03:03:23.507 --> 03:03:26.680
Think she's going to double-cross us?

03:03:26.680 --> 03:03:33.415
LIAM: You've got to prepare for the worst, my
friend. I need you to be ready. If she makes a

03:03:33.415 --> 03:03:40.096
move, you're sitting on her. She doesn't breathe.
She's breathing in black-and-white ass hair.

03:03:40.096 --> 03:03:42.750
Your ass hair. I need you to be ready.

03:03:42.750 --> 03:03:45.621
SAM: All right. What's the signal? I need
signals.

03:03:45.621 --> 03:03:50.516
LIAM: Steveland Cleamer.

03:03:50.516 --> 03:03:52.596
SAM: Steveland Cleamer?

03:03:52.596 --> 03:03:53.904
LIAM: Steveland Cleamer.

03:03:53.904 --> 03:03:55.678
SAM: Nice and cleaned.

03:03:55.678 --> 03:03:58.179
BRIAN: No, not that. Remember the picture you drew
last time.

03:03:58.179 --> 03:04:04.617
LIAM: Let's bring it home.

03:04:04.617 --> 03:04:08.459
TALIESIN: Let's see the spoils of our work.

03:04:08.459 --> 03:04:10.622
MATT: What happens with the tripwires?

03:04:10.622 --> 03:04:16.090
MARISHA: You get to the other end of the hall,
unharmed by a swarm of bees. That's what would

03:04:16.090 --> 03:04:18.026
have happened if you would've tripped them.

03:04:18.026 --> 03:04:20.576
BRIAN: We would've given them &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; honey, 
that's for sure.

03:04:20.576 --> 03:04:27.491
MARISHA: You get to the other end of the hall, and
there's a hex-shaped door that's closed in front,

03:04:27.491 --> 03:04:34.576
and right off to the right of it is a large
pedestal made out of bluish marble,

03:04:34.576 --> 03:04:39.817
and there's a recess in the middle 
of this pedestal, making a bowl.

03:04:39.817 --> 03:04:44.083
There are also four little baskets on either side.

03:04:44.083 --> 03:04:46.343
LIAM: Are there any Skittles in it?

03:04:46.343 --> 03:04:47.881
MARISHA: No.

03:04:47.881 --> 03:04:48.875
SAM: Any honey?

03:04:48.875 --> 03:04:52.437
MATT: Wait, remember that piece of paper that we
got from that guy earlier?

03:04:52.437 --> 03:04:56.024
BRIAN: Buford. Bloomford.

03:04:56.024 --> 03:04:57.132
MATT: Sure.

03:04:57.132 --> 03:04:59.333
LIAM: Honestly, I'm only thinking about honey.

03:04:59.333 --> 03:05:00.758
TALIESIN: It's really about honey.

03:05:00.758 --> 03:05:08.830
MATT: I can't read. Tova?

03:05:08.830 --> 03:05:11.825
MARISHA: "Okay. Yeah, sure."

03:05:11.825 --> 03:05:14.515
SAM: Wait, are we sure we want to share this with
her?

03:05:14.515 --> 03:05:17.815
MATT: She's a partner in this. 
She's getting an equal--

03:05:17.815 --> 03:05:20.278
she's getting all the share we promised her.

03:05:20.278 --> 03:05:24.391
MARISHA: "I already know what it is. I helped them
to design it. I just don't know the actual code

03:05:24.391 --> 03:05:30.272
"they ended up going with. Here, look." She goes
over to it, and she passes her hand over it, and

03:05:30.272 --> 03:05:40.152
it goes (buzzing) and starts glowing, and then
holographic fish appear in the center of it.

03:05:40.152 --> 03:05:43.848
LIAM: Madness coming out.

03:05:43.848 --> 03:05:48.773
SAM: What is this?

03:05:48.773 --> 03:05:56.312
TALIESIN: Oh my god. What is wrong with you?!

03:05:56.312 --> 03:05:58.839
BRIAN: This is the greatest thing I've ever seen
in my life.

03:05:58.839 --> 03:06:03.049
SAM: Do we need these?

03:06:03.049 --> 03:06:04.686
MARISHA: You will.

03:06:04.686 --> 03:06:08.422
MATT: All right, should I read this out loud?

03:06:08.422 --> 03:06:09.499
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:06:09.499 --> 03:06:11.823
MATT: Via Tova reading this to me.

03:06:11.823 --> 03:06:13.811
MARISHA: Yeah, I help him sound it out.

03:06:13.811 --> 03:06:15.539
SAM: You guys have to share one.

03:06:15.539 --> 03:06:18.492
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm into it.

03:06:18.492 --> 03:06:21.854
MATT: Here, you guys should do this. You're the
brains.

03:06:21.854 --> 03:06:23.397
BRIAN: Matt and I will share this one.

03:06:23.397 --> 03:06:34.005
MATT: 'Green, pink, orange, and yellow. Not every
fish is a friendly fellow. Green is mean and pink

03:06:34.005 --> 03:06:45.611
'stinks. Yellow is mellow, but orange is-- orange
is-- screw it. That Hazel Festival committeewoman

03:06:45.611 --> 03:06:53.196
'can go to hell. I'm not a fucking riddle writer.
Here's the code: orange is the best color, so put

03:06:53.196 --> 03:07:00.100
'one orange fish in each basket, except for two in
the pink. Heh, that one was my idea.'

03:07:00.100 --> 03:07:02.647
(laughter)

03:07:02.647 --> 03:07:08.306
MATT: 'Then the stupid, expensive-- '
I'm so proud I married you.

03:07:08.306 --> 03:07:10.352
BRIAN: Hell yeah.

03:07:10.352 --> 03:07:14.699
MATT: 'Then the stupid, expensive door should open.
Don't know why we're spending this much to lock up

03:07:14.699 --> 03:07:19.299
'a few jars of honey, anyway. 
Signed, Buford T. Justice, head of security.'

03:07:19.299 --> 03:07:24.808
MARISHA: As you say this, Tova puts her hand over
again.

03:07:24.808 --> 03:07:28.859
(electronic song in Korean)

03:07:28.859 --> 03:07:31.017
LIAM: An orange in each, except for two in the
pink, right?

03:07:31.017 --> 03:07:33.001
MATT: An orange in each, except for two in the
pink.

03:07:33.001 --> 03:07:37.826
MARISHA: Wait! Someone has to wear 
the bear hands, because I made them get them,

03:07:37.826 --> 03:07:39.508
so it's even funnier.

03:07:39.508 --> 03:07:45.176
MATT: Taliesin, I think you should only get them
if you have the bear hands on.

03:07:45.176 --> 03:07:47.704
MARISHA: One at a time. You've got to have the
bear hands.

03:07:47.704 --> 03:07:50.664
MATT: An orange in each basket.

03:07:50.664 --> 03:07:53.526
LIAM: And two in the pink.

03:07:53.526 --> 03:07:55.365
BRIAN: You've got it!

03:07:55.365 --> 03:07:56.851
MARISHA: Yay!

03:07:56.851 --> 03:07:58.244
BRIAN: An orange in each...

03:07:58.244 --> 03:08:07.214
TALIESIN: What the hell are they singing?

03:08:07.214 --> 03:08:09.761
MARISHA: I got it from South Korea.

03:08:09.761 --> 03:08:15.166
SAM: Any guards coming?

03:08:15.166 --> 03:08:17.327
MARISHA: No. No guards.

03:08:17.327 --> 03:08:18.746
SAM: We have unlimited time?

03:08:18.746 --> 03:08:21.569
MARISHA: He looped the footage. He did pretty
good.

03:08:21.569 --> 03:08:28.688
LIAM: Two oranges in the pink and one in every
other one.

03:08:28.688 --> 03:08:32.769
BRIAN: Oh god. What do I need?

03:08:32.769 --> 03:08:36.041
MARISHA: Oh! No, he's out!

03:08:36.041 --> 03:08:38.509
MATT: Oh god.

03:08:38.509 --> 03:08:44.233
SAM: Oh! Las Vegas, come on! Focus!

03:08:44.233 --> 03:08:47.338
BRIAN: I'm trying, man. I've got fucking bear
hands.

03:08:47.338 --> 03:08:52.826
MATT: One more orange for the pink. Is that all we
need?

03:08:52.826 --> 03:08:56.945
SAM: Come on, you damn wolverine. Get the thing!

03:08:56.945 --> 03:08:58.867
BRIAN: I'm waiting for one to open.

03:08:58.867 --> 03:09:02.830
MATT: Las Vegas, you can do this!

03:09:02.830 --> 03:09:10.405
BRIAN: Goddamn, it's not opening its mouth!

03:09:10.405 --> 03:09:20.213
MARISHA: Okay, as you start getting irritated, you
get a point in bear, Liam Las Vegas.

03:09:20.213 --> 03:09:26.429
TALIESIN: I have never been so proud of you.

03:09:26.429 --> 03:09:31.159
SAM: Oh, yeah. It's the fishing rod 
that's doing it.

03:09:31.159 --> 03:09:32.834
BRIAN: This thing is warped!

03:09:32.834 --> 03:09:34.909
TALIESIN: Why do I always get a warped one?

03:09:34.909 --> 03:09:37.009
LIAM: Too much crystal honey in Vegas, Liam.

03:09:37.009 --> 03:09:40.208
(groaning)

03:09:40.208 --> 03:09:41.944
TALIESIN: You're a disappointment to everybody.

03:09:41.944 --> 03:09:44.419
MARISHA: Come on, Liam Las Vegas. It's got to be
orange.

03:09:44.419 --> 03:09:48.377
LIAM: Liam, you fucking asshole!

03:09:48.377 --> 03:09:53.458
SAM: I'm getting so frustrated that I'm going to
start freaking out and hitting the doors.

03:09:53.458 --> 03:09:57.038
MARISHA: Oh, the doors behind? Take a point in
bear.

03:09:57.038 --> 03:10:00.202
BRIAN: None of them are opening!

03:10:00.202 --> 03:10:04.032
MATT: In the pink!

03:10:04.032 --> 03:10:05.374
LIAM: Two in the pink!

03:10:05.374 --> 03:10:06.874
(cheering)

03:10:06.874 --> 03:10:13.904
MARISHA: And with that, the hex-shaped doors 
open up.

03:10:13.904 --> 03:10:16.866
LIAM: You mad bastard.

03:10:16.866 --> 03:10:18.858
BRIAN: Damn. That was hard, man.

03:10:18.858 --> 03:10:32.542
MARISHA: And behind the doors-- big mystery.
Where's the mystery? Mysterious. Yeah, that's

03:10:32.542 --> 03:10:45.417
good. Behind the door, you see a dimly lit cellar
room. A waft of cool air blasts by you. You see a

03:10:45.417 --> 03:10:52.720
few bar tables that have been tossed over; clearly
left in here for storage. A few bags of

03:10:52.720 --> 03:10:59.442
grain. And in the middle, on discarded bar
tables-- there are three tables. The first one has

03:10:59.442 --> 03:11:08.912
a little note that says "Slayer's Cake." It's got
a nice couple of small half-barrels of honey. The

03:11:08.912 --> 03:11:13.365
second one says "Reginald's daughter." Whatever
her name is. Has a note.

03:11:13.365 --> 03:11:15.466
MATT: It might have been Amelia.

03:11:15.466 --> 03:11:20.446
MARISHA: I think it was. Something like that.
Ariana? Whatever. Third one.

03:11:20.446 --> 03:11:25.070
MATT: The writing isn't very good. The name begins
with an A and then scribbles.

03:11:25.070 --> 03:11:39.112
MARISHA: In scribbled red lettering, says
"Victor." And there's so much honey in actual boar

03:11:39.112 --> 03:11:47.114
heads that's oozing out. Some's dripping off the
side of the table, and then you follow the drip

03:11:47.114 --> 03:12:00.645
down and see more hogs' heads, goat heads. You see a
bear head. Pretty much looks like any type of head

03:12:00.645 --> 03:12:10.346
he could find, he got it and put gray, ichor-y,
sulfuric-smelling honey.

03:12:10.346 --> 03:12:22.373
You see four torch sconces on the walls, lightly
puttering. You follow, and you see, holy shit!

03:12:22.373 --> 03:12:32.702
Victor brought way too much fucking honey, and the
entire edge of the cellar room is filled with

03:12:32.702 --> 03:12:35.350
weird heads of honey.

03:12:35.350 --> 03:12:41.462
LIAM: Waffle, this is it. This is our father's
dream.

03:12:41.462 --> 03:12:43.966
TALIESIN: Everything we've worked for.

03:12:43.966 --> 03:12:46.708
LIAM: We have reached easy street.

03:12:46.708 --> 03:12:53.159
TALIESIN: It's all honey from here on out. 
Just honey. Everything.

03:12:53.159 --> 03:12:55.739
MATT: How are those sconces looking?

03:12:55.739 --> 03:12:57.722
MARISHA: Precarious.

03:12:57.722 --> 03:13:01.014
MATT: What's in them? Is it magical light?

03:13:01.014 --> 03:13:11.819
MARISHA: Nope, it looks like torch sconces that
they dipped in kerosene. A long-burning torch;

03:13:11.819 --> 03:13:17.442
they probably lit them when they were bringing in
the honey, and then walked out.

03:13:17.442 --> 03:13:21.974
MATT: Do any of them look viably close to dropping
embers?

03:13:21.974 --> 03:13:29.064
MARISHA: There is one that's right over the table
of Victor's that looks like it's a miracle it

03:13:29.064 --> 03:13:31.969
hasn't honestly exploded yet.

03:13:31.969 --> 03:13:36.081
TALIESIN: Let's grab the honey and run.

03:13:36.081 --> 03:13:39.579
BRIAN: I've got a cart outside waiting, with a
horse and everything.

03:13:39.579 --> 03:13:45.819
MATT: Code Sad Bear! We've got to move &lt;i&gt;now&lt;/i&gt;.

03:13:45.819 --> 03:13:48.227
TALIESIN: I'm grabbing honey.

03:13:48.227 --> 03:13:50.193
BRIAN: Is Tova still with us?

03:13:50.193 --> 03:13:56.935
MARISHA: Tova is. She sees the same thing. She's a
little confused as to why you're acting this way.

03:13:56.935 --> 03:14:00.963
MATT: I turn around to her. Tova, all this gray
honey shit is explosive.

03:14:00.963 --> 03:14:02.065
MARISHA: "What?"

03:14:02.065 --> 03:14:03.672
MATT: I know! He's crazy.

03:14:03.672 --> 03:14:06.241
MARISHA: "Why? Why would you-- 
who would do that?"

03:14:06.241 --> 03:14:10.581
MATT: The more you try and question his motives,
the more he makes you more like him. Keep going.

03:14:10.581 --> 03:14:13.103
MARISHA: She walks over, takes a little.

03:14:13.103 --> 03:14:20.424
MATT: I immediately take the fire staff I've been
carrying and throw it as far as I can

03:14:20.424 --> 03:14:22.934
down the opposite hallway, away from this room.

03:14:22.934 --> 03:14:29.852
MARISHA: "Okay, let's go!" And she starts scooping
up honey and throwing them into the Radio Flyer.

03:14:29.852 --> 03:14:32.055
De Rolo Roller.

03:14:32.055 --> 03:14:34.866
BRIAN: Blah-blah-blah.

03:14:34.866 --> 03:14:47.625
MATT: Actually, while this is happening, I reach
over and go: Hey, Cookie. If I buy you a new hat,

03:14:47.625 --> 03:14:49.292
could I borrow yours?

03:14:49.292 --> 03:14:50.944
LIAM: Fuck yeah.

03:14:50.944 --> 03:14:54.928
BRIAN: (singing) If you want to see paradise...

03:14:54.928 --> 03:15:06.264
MATT: I'm going to take the top hat and place it
just over the heavy collection of Victor's honey

03:15:06.264 --> 03:15:08.805
beneath where the sconce is.

03:15:08.805 --> 03:15:12.894
MARISHA: Okay. Are you still wearing the
sunglasses, Peddy?

03:15:12.894 --> 03:15:15.264
SAM: Of course.

03:15:15.264 --> 03:15:20.815
MARISHA: You get a little bit of an advantage,
because at this time, you look up, and you see

03:15:20.815 --> 03:15:26.165
through the roof of the cellar very quick,
shadowed movement.

03:15:26.165 --> 03:15:29.758
SAM: Someone's above us.

03:15:29.758 --> 03:15:34.961
TALIESIN: We'd better move. I'm going to create 
a distraction. Let's get this honey

03:15:34.961 --> 03:15:36.449
out into the cart right now.

03:15:36.449 --> 03:15:38.605
MATT: All right, moving honey as fast as we can
into the cart.

03:15:38.605 --> 03:15:44.084
LIAM: Also, while we're moving, I'm going to take
a big fucking bite of honey on the move.

03:15:44.084 --> 03:15:45.823
MARISHA: Put a point back into bear.

03:15:45.823 --> 03:15:49.309
TALIESIN: I'm going to do the same, as well.

03:15:49.309 --> 03:15:51.484
BRIAN: While they're doing that, I'm going to move
some honey onto the thing, and I'm going to wink

03:15:51.484 --> 03:15:54.116
at Tova and say: I thought I told you that we
won't stop.

03:15:54.116 --> 03:16:10.578
MARISHA: She goes, "Smooth." About this time,
(thud) and through the floorboards from above,

03:16:10.578 --> 03:16:21.814
they splinter, and from the other side, and two
bears in black gis and ninja masks fall through.

03:16:21.814 --> 03:16:32.467
Liam, you look over your shoulder. Las Vegas. And
around the corner are two more bears coming in

03:16:32.467 --> 03:16:39.349
through the hall that you all just entered, too.
Tova looks up, she sees them, and she goes,

03:16:39.349 --> 03:16:42.312
"Shit, it's the Bearracuda!"

03:16:42.312 --> 03:16:43.473
BRIAN: They're not with you?

03:16:43.473 --> 03:16:47.453
(groaning)

03:16:47.453 --> 03:16:52.689
MATT: I immediately glance around. They came
through the ceiling; are there any of the sconces

03:16:52.689 --> 03:16:54.865
that look close to being--

03:16:54.865 --> 03:17:01.677
MARISHA: Yes, there's one on the left closest to
the door. Fractured and got knocked over by one of

03:17:01.677 --> 03:17:06.981
the splintering floorboards and is now swinging
above all of the honey.

03:17:06.981 --> 03:17:12.366
MATT: We can't-- and I point to the ninja bears
coming our way and the ones that just entered--

03:17:12.366 --> 03:17:20.721
Handle it! And I go for the swinging sconce board
to see if I can clap it out with my bear paws and

03:17:20.721 --> 03:17:22.250
put out the flame.

03:17:22.250 --> 03:17:24.332
MARISHA: Okay, roll for bear.

03:17:24.332 --> 03:17:28.533
BRIAN: Am I able to get the cart of honey--

03:17:28.533 --> 03:17:29.760
MATT: Nope!

03:17:29.760 --> 03:17:37.725
MARISHA: Unfortunately, as you try to stamp it out
with the board, the other floorboard catches on

03:17:37.725 --> 03:17:40.504
fire, and now you have two flame sources.

03:17:40.504 --> 03:17:48.773
BRIAN: Can I start trying to make it out with the
de Rolo Roller to the cart? Take the honey out?

03:17:48.773 --> 03:17:50.353
TALIESIN: I've got this, guys!

03:17:50.353 --> 03:17:56.661
MARISHA: As you try to roll it out, you have two
bear ninjas swiping above you. What do you do?

03:17:56.661 --> 03:18:03.951
BRIAN: I try to run past them as fast as I can,
and if one of them gets too close to me, I can try

03:18:03.951 --> 03:18:05.532
to swipe him on my way past.

03:18:05.532 --> 03:18:10.069
MARISHA: Okay, use your nimble bear abilities 
as a honey badger. Straight bear roll.

03:18:10.069 --> 03:18:11.382
BRIAN: Oh, just one?

03:18:11.382 --> 03:18:12.511
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:18:12.511 --> 03:18:14.458
BRIAN: That's a fail.

03:18:14.458 --> 03:18:22.768
MARISHA: Okay, one of them gets a good slap on
you. Bounce off the wall. You get aggravated.

03:18:22.768 --> 03:18:24.296
Point into bear.

03:18:24.296 --> 03:18:30.212
SAM: I'm going to go for one of the ninjas and
attack with my strength. Panda strength.

03:18:30.212 --> 03:18:31.951
MARISHA: Okay, roll with advantage.

03:18:31.951 --> 03:18:34.528
SAM: That's a success. That's not.

03:18:34.528 --> 03:18:41.641
MARISHA: You take the first one, and you sandwich
him with your weight up against the wall.

03:18:41.641 --> 03:18:46.546
He's trying to fight you off.

03:18:46.546 --> 03:18:48.912
SAM: As he's there, I hit him with the tree
stick.

03:18:48.912 --> 03:18:52.659
MARISHA: Okay, roll for criminal to use the
stick.

03:18:52.659 --> 03:18:55.047
SAM: No.

03:18:55.047 --> 03:19:02.975
MARISHA: Okay. Unfortunately, as you're sandwiched
up against him when you try to use it, you don't

03:19:02.975 --> 03:19:09.068
really get good leverage, so you go (bop) with a
dead stick. It doesn't really work. It's still

03:19:09.068 --> 03:19:10.575
forcing against you.

03:19:10.575 --> 03:19:13.135
BRIAN: Not your first time dealing with a dead
stick, is it, Peddy?

03:19:13.135 --> 03:19:22.527
MARISHA: Tova reaches in the back of her suit, and
she pulls out a little throwing hammer. Throws it.

03:19:22.527 --> 03:19:30.595
Let me roll for Tova. Tries and succeeds. 
Hits the first ninja; it gets a little distracted.

03:19:30.595 --> 03:19:36.884
What are you guys doing? You've got the ninjas 
kind of warded off. Two more coming in

03:19:36.884 --> 03:19:41.309
from where they were after Liam Las Vegas.

03:19:41.309 --> 03:19:44.065
BRIAN: Have they abandoned me, so I can keep going
and try to get the cart outside?

03:19:44.065 --> 03:19:45.668
MARISHA: Yeah, they're not too distracted 
with you.

03:19:45.668 --> 03:19:48.860
BRIAN: Okay, so I'm going to keep pushing the de
Rolo Roller out to the thing and load the honey

03:19:48.860 --> 03:19:50.365
into the cart.

03:19:50.365 --> 03:19:56.947
MATT: Knowing that upstairs is Grog, two people
that we've knocked out, another drunk guy who's

03:19:56.947 --> 03:20:00.975
passed out in the bar, and god knows who's nearby,
and the amount of Victor honey that's in here, I'm

03:20:00.975 --> 03:20:02.719
focusing on trying to put the fires out.

03:20:02.719 --> 03:20:04.617
MARISHA: Okay, roll again.

03:20:04.617 --> 03:20:11.849
SAM: Are you going to pee on the fire?

03:20:11.849 --> 03:20:22.037
MATT: Yeah. I'm one of the few that hasn't peed,
so I probably have a full tank. My paws are

03:20:22.037 --> 03:20:28.758
scalded from patting the flames out. I lean back
and try and get as much of an arc as I can.

03:20:28.758 --> 03:20:34.496
MARISHA: Okay, yeah. Roll for bear.

03:20:34.496 --> 03:20:36.249
SAM and MATT: That's a bear thing.

03:20:36.249 --> 03:20:39.415
MATT: No. That's a four.

03:20:39.415 --> 03:20:41.614
MARISHA: Unfortunately, as you--

03:20:41.614 --> 03:20:43.071
MATT: Performance anxiety!

03:20:43.071 --> 03:20:46.376
TALIESIN: Are you pee shy?

03:20:46.376 --> 03:20:48.496
MATT: Trinket apparently is pee shy.

03:20:48.496 --> 03:21:00.024
MARISHA: You back up, and as you back up, you bump
into the table of Victor's honey, and it goes

03:21:00.024 --> 03:21:06.579
(crash) and spills flammable honey 
all across the floor.

03:21:06.579 --> 03:21:07.961
MATT: Sorry!

03:21:07.961 --> 03:21:11.452
SAM: This is not going well!

03:21:11.452 --> 03:21:16.339
MARISHA: The other two Bearracudas come in,
squaring off.

03:21:16.339 --> 03:21:22.575
LIAM: Fuck this! Come here, you. Everybody run!
And I head towards the Bearracudas.

03:21:22.575 --> 03:21:23.685
MARISHA: Okay.

03:21:23.685 --> 03:21:27.843
LIAM: Let's fucking do this.

03:21:27.843 --> 03:21:29.161
MARISHA: Roll for bear attack.

03:21:29.161 --> 03:21:31.942
LIAM: Yes.

03:21:31.942 --> 03:21:38.797
MARISHA: All right, you take one of them. Two big
haymaker swipes. They try to block with their bear

03:21:38.797 --> 03:21:44.615
katanas and miss, and he gets two big gashes right
across his face. He's a little disoriented. You've

03:21:44.615 --> 03:21:47.523
got one more that's in there. He's pretty
unattended.

03:21:47.523 --> 03:21:52.821
TALIESIN: I have something I can do, but it's not
going to be pretty.

03:21:52.821 --> 03:21:54.061
SAM: Let's do it.

03:21:54.061 --> 03:21:55.891
LIAM: Waffle, hack the system!

03:21:55.891 --> 03:22:03.473
TALIESIN: I take the fez of honey, and I throw it
at the Bearracuda.

03:22:03.473 --> 03:22:06.686
MARISHA: Roll for bear.

03:22:06.686 --> 03:22:09.640
TALIESIN: No.

03:22:09.640 --> 03:22:10.854
MARISHA: No?

03:22:10.854 --> 03:22:17.477
TALIESIN: No. I don't know what not throwing 
a hat full of honey looks like.

03:22:17.477 --> 03:22:27.134
MARISHA: You try to get a nice overhand, but it
slips a little bit, and you have this weird,

03:22:27.134 --> 03:22:33.130
spiraling arc of flammable honey that goes
everywhere. You do hit one of the ninjas

03:22:33.130 --> 03:22:35.940
with a decent amount of honey. 
Gets a little disoriented.

03:22:35.940 --> 03:22:44.003
Backs into one of the torch "sconches." 
Sconces. Lights on fire.

03:22:44.003 --> 03:22:45.630
TALIESIN: We've got to roll, kids.

03:22:45.630 --> 03:22:58.540
MARISHA: (yelping) He backs up, trips, blinded by
the fire, falls onto the ground. The fire starts

03:22:58.540 --> 03:23:09.466
following the spilled honey, and then suddenly,
everyone: time slows down. Tova sees what happens.

03:23:09.466 --> 03:23:20.329
She turns to everyone and goes, "Run!" and takes
off through the door.

03:23:20.329 --> 03:23:22.923
TALIESIN: I teleport towards the cart.

03:23:22.923 --> 03:23:26.942
BRIAN: I'm on the cart with the reins in my hands,
ready to go. I'm out there.

03:23:26.942 --> 03:23:35.686
MARISHA: Waffle is gone. You see the fire 
getting closer and closer.

03:23:35.686 --> 03:23:41.575
SAM: I'm going to head for the door, 
and on my way, I'm going to grab Tova by the hair

03:23:41.575 --> 03:23:43.112
and pull her back in.

03:23:43.112 --> 03:23:45.353
MARISHA: Oh shit!

03:23:45.353 --> 03:23:48.478
LIAM: Are there still Bearracudas?

03:23:48.478 --> 03:23:57.427
MARISHA: There are. One is now released free. 
One is on fire. The other is distracted

03:23:57.427 --> 03:24:01.342
by your scratching, and there was one 
that Tova was squaring off.

03:24:01.342 --> 03:24:03.161
LIAM: But she just got pulled through the door?

03:24:03.161 --> 03:24:04.913
MARISHA: She got pulled through the door.

03:24:04.913 --> 03:24:11.662
LIAM: I say: I hear my father's voice in the
morning. And I dive at the remaining Bearracuda

03:24:11.662 --> 03:24:15.935
and plow them down 
into the flammable honey on the floor.

03:24:15.935 --> 03:24:24.454
MARISHA: Okay, roll for bear attack. Also roll for
your muscle strength, so you get advantage.

03:24:24.454 --> 03:24:25.708
LIAM: Yeah.

03:24:25.708 --> 03:24:29.207
SAM: Fail, fail.

03:24:29.207 --> 03:24:39.391
MARISHA: Oh no! You knock over the last remaining
free Bearracuda. He falls right into the flaming

03:24:39.391 --> 03:24:45.470
honey, immediately bursts into flames-- way more
than probably would actually happen.

03:24:45.470 --> 03:24:49.242
You scootch back. Roll to avoid the flame.

03:24:49.242 --> 03:24:51.764
LIAM: Fail.

03:24:51.764 --> 03:25:03.864
MARISHA: You do take a point into criminal for
what you just did. As you back up, Peddy you see

03:25:03.864 --> 03:25:09.850
trying to bolt for the door, grabs Tova, throws
her right back into you. You guys boing.

03:25:09.850 --> 03:25:13.448
So now it's you and Tova. You're out.

03:25:13.448 --> 03:25:15.073
MATT: I have a question.

03:25:15.073 --> 03:25:15.968
MARISHA: Yeah?

03:25:15.968 --> 03:25:20.292
MATT: The trails of honey, are they heading
towards the large--

03:25:20.292 --> 03:25:29.161
MARISHA: A hundred percent. You all have a good
solid four to five more seconds of slo-mo time.

03:25:29.161 --> 03:25:36.510
(whoosh) Peddy's out!

03:25:36.510 --> 03:25:40.759
Tova's like, "What the fuck?"

03:25:40.816 --> 03:25:47.176
MATT: As Tova comes back and slams into Cookie, I
spin around, now that I see this is my fault,

03:25:47.176 --> 03:25:51.297
and I push the back of Cookie to shove 
both of them back through the front doorway.

03:25:51.297 --> 03:25:54.646
I'm going to try to use whatever bear strength 
I have to shove them forward.

03:25:54.646 --> 03:25:56.460
MARISHA: Okay, roll for bear.

03:25:56.460 --> 03:26:00.082
MATT: Success.

03:26:00.082 --> 03:26:18.737
MARISHA: You guys trip. Trinket, as you push, 
you turn, and you see (flame noises).

03:26:18.737 --> 03:26:23.469
And in slow motion, (explosions). 
You make one more bounding leap

03:26:23.529 --> 03:26:27.275
as the explosion blows you out of the cellar door.

03:26:27.275 --> 03:26:32.641
MATT: I close my eyes and in the back of my head,
go: I hope you're within about a hundred feet

03:26:32.641 --> 03:26:36.889
of me, wherever you are, Vex.

03:26:36.889 --> 03:26:48.412
MARISHA: You are jettisoned with the cellar door.
An exploding round of fire

03:26:48.412 --> 03:26:55.057
comes barreling down the hall, burning
all of the oxygen-- that's how fire works--

03:26:55.057 --> 03:27:02.527
in the room as it blasts out of the door. 
Everyone is safe, but there is no Trinket.

03:27:02.527 --> 03:27:09.526
Flames die down. You look in the hallway,

03:27:09.526 --> 03:27:16.356
and there, a little singed, flaming fur, 
with some bald spots, is Trinket.

03:27:16.356 --> 03:27:18.598
SAM: Dead?

03:27:18.598 --> 03:27:19.983
MARISHA: Still alive.

03:27:19.983 --> 03:27:23.738
BRIAN: Get out here! Can I yell "get out here" 
at him?

03:27:23.738 --> 03:27:26.437
MATT: Am I conscious?

03:27:26.437 --> 03:27:27.910
MARISHA: You're unconscious.

03:27:27.910 --> 03:27:29.700
BRIAN: Wake up and then get out here!

03:27:29.700 --> 03:27:34.983
MATT: Which means she's not within a hundred feet
of me, for the love of god.

03:27:34.983 --> 03:27:39.108
SAM: I'm going to go get Trinket and drag. 
No bear left behind!

03:27:39.108 --> 03:27:41.038
MATT: Are the ninjas still around?

03:27:41.038 --> 03:27:43.223
MARISHA: The ninjas all seem to be dead.

03:27:43.223 --> 03:27:55.532
SAM: I'm going to drag him out, lay him down. No
harm will come today. Like in the Revenant,

03:27:55.532 --> 03:28:06.960
I will aggressively mouth-to-mouth. 
Snout-to-snout resuscitation.

03:28:06.960 --> 03:28:09.264
MARISHA: Roll for...

03:28:09.264 --> 03:28:11.357
BRIAN: BPR?

03:28:11.357 --> 03:28:14.522
MARISHA: Yeah. Roll for BPR.

03:28:14.522 --> 03:28:16.410
LIAM: Like Ed Harris in the Abyss.

03:28:16.410 --> 03:28:18.988
MARISHA: Roll for bear. Yeah, you got it. 
You're good.

03:28:18.988 --> 03:28:24.406
SAM: (heavy breathing)

03:28:24.406 --> 03:28:28.494
MARISHA: It's a really odd-looking sight. 
No one's sure what exactly is happening.

03:28:28.494 --> 03:28:30.521
BRIAN: I cover the horse's eyes.

03:28:30.521 --> 03:28:34.114
MARISHA: Trinket, you do wake up.

03:28:34.114 --> 03:28:39.379
SAM: Trinket, if you'd died, I would be so upset.

03:28:39.379 --> 03:28:47.618
MATT: Confused bear. What's going on?

03:28:47.618 --> 03:28:54.245
MARISHA: About this time, Liam Las Vegas, 
you see all the guards running up the alley,

03:28:54.245 --> 03:29:01.282
coming in this direction. The Sun Kissed Tavern 
is up in flames right now.

03:29:01.282 --> 03:29:04.823
BRIAN: I fucking gently and humanely encourage
the--

03:29:04.823 --> 03:29:13.042
MARISHA: You see another bald panda bear 
stumble out. "Oh shit."

03:29:13.042 --> 03:29:18.766
It's Grog. Wakes up from everything. 
What are you guys doing?

03:29:18.766 --> 03:29:20.687
TALIESIN: We're taking off with the honey.

03:29:20.687 --> 03:29:25.250
LIAM: We've got to take the honey and run. 
Come on!

03:29:25.250 --> 03:29:30.131
MATT: As a thank you to Peddy as I get up, 
I grab Peddy by the shoulders

03:29:30.131 --> 03:29:32.220
and push Peddy up onto the cart 
with everybody else.

03:29:32.220 --> 03:29:35.450
MARISHA: Tova runs over. She jumps into the back
of the cart. "Come on!"

03:29:35.450 --> 03:29:38.774
LIAM: Hoppity-hop! Come on!

03:29:38.774 --> 03:29:42.089
MARISHA: Trinket, you're the only one. 
Are you on?

03:29:42.089 --> 03:29:52.256
MATT: No. I look up and say: My family's here.
A life of crime's not for me. You go on ahead.

03:29:52.256 --> 03:29:53.932
You've earned it.

03:29:53.932 --> 03:29:55.968
SAM: We'll never forget you.

03:29:55.968 --> 03:29:58.761
TALIESIN: I grab a little jar of honey. 
Toss it down.

03:29:58.761 --> 03:30:02.026
If anyone asks, we have no idea 
where it came from.

03:30:02.026 --> 03:30:07.124
BRIAN: I yell down: Tell her to fucking remember
Hunter's Mark!

03:30:07.124 --> 03:30:09.788
(laughter)

03:30:09.788 --> 03:30:12.586
MATT: I do, constantly.

03:30:12.586 --> 03:30:21.251
MARISHA: With a crack of the whips, 
you all speed off down into an empty alleyway.

03:30:21.251 --> 03:30:24.849
LIAM: Could've been beautiful, kid. Good luck!

03:30:24.849 --> 03:30:32.795
MARISHA: Tova yells, "Trinket! I'll remember this.
You are a great High Bear."

03:30:32.795 --> 03:30:36.276
MATT: (moans)

03:30:36.276 --> 03:30:43.970
MARISHA: (moans) The horse and buggy pulls off, 
a few rogue cabbages and vegetables

03:30:43.970 --> 03:30:45.760
falling off the end.

03:30:45.760 --> 03:30:53.658
SAM: I turn to the other dudes and say: Listen,
all this trouble for some honey. I know a place

03:30:53.658 --> 03:31:00.728
where bamboo literally grows in forests. 
We can go there and eat as much of it as we want.

03:31:00.728 --> 03:31:04.487
We don't have to break in anywhere. 
There's no surveillance cameras.

03:31:04.487 --> 03:31:09.846
It just grows! Come with me. It'll be fun.
We can turn over a new leaf.

03:31:09.846 --> 03:31:13.688
BRIAN: But on the other side of that leaf, 
there isn't going to be honey,

03:31:13.688 --> 03:31:15.412
and for us, it's about the honey.

03:31:15.412 --> 03:31:19.314
LIAM: Show me the honey.

03:31:19.314 --> 03:31:22.784
BRIAN: Show me the honey, honey.

03:31:22.784 --> 03:31:25.320
SAM: Tova, I'm sorry I tried to kill you.

03:31:25.320 --> 03:31:33.294
MARISHA: "It's all right. It happens a lot. Yeah.
Y'all are all right. I'll talk to the High Bear

03:31:33.294 --> 03:31:39.398
"committee and make sure you guys don't have 
any heat on your tails after this."

03:31:39.398 --> 03:31:43.180
LIAM: You're sure you don't want to come with us?
See the world, sample honey?

03:31:43.180 --> 03:31:49.449
MARISHA: "I've seen enough of the world. 
I think I'm ready for a little honey vacation."

03:31:49.449 --> 03:31:52.119
LIAM: What the fuck does that mean?

03:31:52.119 --> 03:31:55.756
SAM: I honestly don't know.

03:31:55.756 --> 03:31:58.873
BRIAN: I think she's talking about rehab. 
I think she means rehab.

03:31:58.873 --> 03:32:07.013
MARISHA: As you all ride off into the sunset, away
from Westruun, Trinket, you're back in the flaming

03:32:07.013 --> 03:32:14.281
Sun Kissed Tavern. A bunch of guards run in, Vex
and Pike among them. Vex immediately sees you.

03:32:14.281 --> 03:32:25.983
"Oh, my darling bear. Oh no! What happened?" 
She turns and looks at Grog. "Grog."

03:32:25.983 --> 03:32:29.144
MATT: I fall on the ground and go belly-up and go,
(piteous moaning).

03:32:29.144 --> 03:32:37.786
MARISHA: "Oh, buddy. Here, I got you those treats.
Did you save the day? Did you?

03:32:37.786 --> 03:32:41.606
"Are you a good bear? Oh. Grog!"

03:32:41.606 --> 03:32:44.550
And that is where we will end tonight's game.

03:32:44.550 --> 03:32:55.171
(cheering)

03:32:55.171 --> 03:32:56.553
BRIAN: All right!

03:32:56.553 --> 03:32:58.698
MARISHA: That was terrifying! Oh my god.

03:32:58.698 --> 03:33:04.890
LIAM: I wanted to break canon and take Trinket
with us across the nation! Goddamn it!

03:33:04.890 --> 03:33:06.723
MATT: Trinket wouldn't leave.

03:33:06.723 --> 03:33:08.830
BRIAN: We would've gotten 
some strongly worded emails.

03:33:08.830 --> 03:33:13.157
TALIESIN: I wonder if it was Sam Elliot 
at the bar telling that story.

03:33:13.157 --> 03:33:15.113
"Well, Trinket had quite a time."

03:33:15.113 --> 03:33:17.566
BRIAN: Sometimes, there's a bear.

03:33:17.566 --> 03:33:19.983
MARISHA: Good work, bears.

03:33:19.983 --> 03:33:23.430
MATT: Thank you so much for running that. 
Thank you, Marisha.

03:33:23.430 --> 03:33:26.636
TALIESIN: Holy fucking shit.

03:33:26.636 --> 03:33:29.533
MARISHA: I don't think we fucked up canon too
much. That's all right, right?

03:33:29.533 --> 03:33:32.436
LIAM: Fucked up canon? Tova's alive!

03:33:32.436 --> 03:33:33.574
MARISHA: Tova's alive.

03:33:33.574 --> 03:33:34.696
LIAM: Tova's alive!

03:33:34.696 --> 03:33:39.462
MARISHA: I hope Noelle is okay with me doing this.
I meant to text her and email her about it, and I

03:33:39.462 --> 03:33:42.303
kept forgetting, so sorry, Tova.

03:33:42.303 --> 03:33:45.309
BRIAN: I got a text that she has begun litigation
against us already.

03:33:45.309 --> 03:33:47.550
LIAM: Tova's alive!

03:33:47.550 --> 03:33:50.497
BRIAN: Thank you, Grant, for making an amazing
game, too.

03:33:50.497 --> 03:33:55.759
MARISHA: Yeah, for anyone who wants to play this.
If you watched this and were like, "holy shit, now

03:33:55.759 --> 03:34:00.213
"I want to play Honey Heist," it's free to
download. You can download it off his website,

03:34:00.213 --> 03:34:02.620
which I believe is granthowitt.com.

03:34:02.620 --> 03:34:05.141
LIAM: Single sheet, in very large text.

03:34:05.141 --> 03:34:12.305
MARISHA: Yeah, it is a two-page rulebook. One
page for everyone, and one page for the DM. And

03:34:12.305 --> 03:34:19.574
there is a super-secret spells list, if you are a
Patreon backer.

03:34:19.574 --> 03:34:28.443
SAM: One of the spells that I accidentally got
would've turned one of us into secretly two bears

03:34:28.443 --> 03:34:33.821
hiding in a bear costume, and we popped out 
and became two bears.

03:34:33.821 --> 03:34:41.530
MARISHA: You guys were actually supposed to find 
a trenchcoat at some point and get that.

03:34:41.530 --> 03:34:43.313
TALIESIN: And get two bears in a trenchcoat?

03:34:43.313 --> 03:34:44.937
MARISHA: Yeah, it's two bears in a trenchcoat.

03:34:44.937 --> 03:34:50.070
MATT: If you're looking for extra content 
like that, he offers that on his Patreon.

03:34:50.070 --> 03:34:56.235
MARISHA: On his Patreon, yeah. It should be
spammed in the chat right now:

03:34:56.304 --> 03:35:03.626
patreon.com/gshowitt, I believe. 
But yeah, there's a whole other optional--

03:35:03.626 --> 03:35:11.232
you can roll to have cantrips 
and things like that as an added dimension.

03:35:11.232 --> 03:35:14.963
SAM: Where do they get the battle board from
tonight's game?

03:35:14.963 --> 03:35:18.181
MARISHA: That you can get on Amazon Prime!

03:35:18.181 --> 03:35:20.246
SAM: With that song?

03:35:20.246 --> 03:35:25.000
MATT: You can find that theme on iTunes 
for download.

03:35:25.000 --> 03:35:28.464
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughs)

03:35:28.464 --> 03:35:32.408
(electronic song in Korean)

03:35:32.408 --> 03:35:35.921
MARISHA: I came across this one and was like,
"Shit, it says it plays a song?

03:35:35.921 --> 03:35:40.703
"I don't want anything that plays music-- 
no, I want something that plays music." Yeah.

03:35:40.703 --> 03:35:42.473
BRIAN: Pineapple pen.

03:35:42.473 --> 03:35:46.767
(laughter)

03:35:46.767 --> 03:35:56.956
MARISHA: I tried to come up with a million codes
and gave up, so that's how that letter came out.

03:35:56.956 --> 03:36:00.593
SAM: We'll talk about it on Talks Machina.

03:36:00.593 --> 03:36:04.615
BRIAN: Talks on Tuesday with Marisha 
and whoever else is not working.

03:36:04.615 --> 03:36:09.092
MARISHA: And I guess we'll see all of you guys 
at PAX.

03:36:09.092 --> 03:36:16.800
SAM: Special thanks to our sponsor tonight: Marvel
Puzzle Quest. Go to bit.ly/MarvelCrit, capital M,

03:36:16.800 --> 03:36:23.992
capital C. Make sure that they know that 
Critical Role sent you. And don't forget, also,

03:36:23.992 --> 03:36:30.095
that you can battle with some of your favorite 
X-Men, like Rogue or Gambit. That's all I've got.

03:36:30.095 --> 03:36:36.234
MARISHA: Thank you all so much. Next week 
is Sam's one-shot. We will see you all soon.

03:36:36.234 --> 03:36:38.324
Is it Thursday yet?

03:36:38.324 --> 03:36:42.826
BRIAN: It's still Thursday, technically.
I got one! No, I didn't. Goddamn it.

03:36:42.826 --> 03:43:26.134
[music]
