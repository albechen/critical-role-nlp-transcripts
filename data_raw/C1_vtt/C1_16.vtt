00:00:00.666 --> 00:00:04.008
MATT: Hello, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to
this evening's episode of Critical Role, where a

00:00:04.052 --> 00:00:08.632
bunch of us nerdy voice actors sit around a table
and play Dungeons &amp; Dragons. If you are returning,

00:00:08.632 --> 00:00:12.732
welcome back. For those who it's their first time
watching us live on the stream, welcome to the

00:00:12.732 --> 00:00:18.434
chaos. So, before I begin, a couple of quick
notifications I want to give you guys. We had our

00:00:18.434 --> 00:00:25.315
first subscriber giveaway hit before the show
started at 4,200. It was LL1973. Turn the mic

00:00:25.315 --> 00:00:33.681
around. Oh, now you can hear me. Look at this!
The magic of live. Live communication. You have a

00:00:33.742 --> 00:00:39.971
wonderful view of this fantastic midsection. It's
delightful. There we go. Is that better?

00:00:39.971 --> 00:00:40.979
ZAC: Yep.

00:00:40.979 --> 00:00:47.761
MATT: Velcome. So, welcome to Critical Role, for
those who didn't hear me before. D&amp;D, voice

00:00:47.761 --> 00:00:53.452
actors, you know the drill now. So our first
giveaway already happened tonight for the

00:00:53.452 --> 00:00:59.277
subscriber count at 4,200 to LL1973.
Congratulations. You're going to be winning a

00:00:59.277 --> 00:01:03.001
signed Player's Handbook of Dungeons &amp; Dragons
Fifth Edition, as well as a signed photo of the

00:01:03.001 --> 00:01:09.392
Critical Role cast. Our next one will be at 4,250,
so, up to every fifty subscribers after that we

00:01:09.392 --> 00:01:12.134
will be giving away an additional Player's
Handbook and photo signed by the cast.

00:01:12.134 --> 00:01:13.280
Awesome times.

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.334
(cheering)

00:01:15.334 --> 00:01:16.388
MARISHA: Awesome times?

00:01:16.388 --> 00:01:17.441
MATT: Indeed, very awesome times.

00:01:17.441 --> 00:01:18.733
MARISHA: Good times, good time together.

00:01:18.733 --> 00:01:23.374
MATT: I think so, indeed. Also, as a heads-up to
you guys, there will be no Critical Role next week

00:01:23.374 --> 00:01:26.201
because the San Diego Comic-Con is happening. Down
in San Diego.

00:01:26.201 --> 00:01:27.979
MARISHA: We're doing a panel, aren't we?

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:31.156
MATT: I know, we have a panel, though. We have a
panel Thursday, I'll be on the main Geek and

00:01:31.205 --> 00:01:35.848
Sundry panel with Laura at 1-2 and then we have
our actual full Critical Role panel from 4-5. So

00:01:35.848 --> 00:01:38.494
if you are going to be there, come see us at PetCo
Park on Thursday.

00:01:38.494 --> 00:01:39.854
LAURA: You don't need a badge.

00:01:39.854 --> 00:01:42.011
MATT: Nope, you can just come and walk on in.

00:01:42.011 --> 00:01:45.994
MARISHA: Yeah, it is at PetCo Park, so don't get
lost looking around the convention center. Because

00:01:45.994 --> 00:01:48.857
it won't be there. It's at PetCo Park.

00:01:48.857 --> 00:01:52.707
MATT: It's the big sports stadium, which to me is
a wonderful irony of us giving a panel about

00:01:52.707 --> 00:02:02.348
Dungeons &amp; Dragons in the center of a giant sports
stadium. That's right! Indoor kids. However,

00:02:02.348 --> 00:02:11.972
however, they are also filming the panel for those
who can't be there. The panel will be on the

00:02:11.972 --> 00:02:17.781
stream the following day, I believe, so check it
out there, after, with the rest of the Comic-Con

00:02:17.781 --> 00:02:23.401
stream coverage. It'll be fun. Yeah, so that'll be
good. The week after that, me and Marisha are

00:02:23.401 --> 00:02:29.161
going to be out of town in New Zealand, so this
means a two-week period without Critical Role

00:02:29.161 --> 00:02:33.399
main-story stuff, and I apologize, this is all
stuff that got planned before the stream even

00:02:33.399 --> 00:02:38.856
started. We'll be at a convention in New Zealand.
For those out there planning to come to

00:02:38.856 --> 00:02:42.147
Armageddon, please come see us, we'll be down
there. It'll be fun for all New Zealand fans.

00:02:42.147 --> 00:02:48.432
Otherwise, the rest of the Critical Role cast that
are available will be here and will play some

00:02:48.432 --> 00:02:53.641
other sort of game together and generally interact
with the chat and have a good time until we

00:02:53.641 --> 00:02:54.955
return. So.

00:02:54.955 --> 00:02:56.259
MARISHA: We're working it out.

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:58.290
MATT: Yeah, we're getting the circumstance ironed
out.

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.475
MARISHA AND ORION: Hi, Liam!

00:03:01.475 --> 00:03:03.252
MATT: We have Liam on Skype over here.

00:03:03.252 --> 00:03:04.290
LIAM: Hi, guys.

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:05.578
MATT: What's up, buddy?

00:03:05.578 --> 00:03:06.952
LIAM: Hi!

00:03:06.952 --> 00:03:12.546
MATT: Liam, who's finishing up his vacation as
well. As far as I understand, we have a--

00:03:12.546 --> 00:03:14.356
MARISHA: How's New Jersey?

00:03:14.356 --> 00:03:19.136
LIAM: I am deep in upstate New York on the
Canadian border.

00:03:19.136 --> 00:03:27.331
MATT: Slowly migrating into expatriotism. Don't
go Canadian on us.

00:03:27.331 --> 00:03:30.102
LIAM: It's frightening to drive here at night. I
can't wait to do it at two in the morning.

00:03:30.151 --> 00:03:31.106
LAURA: Yay.

00:03:31.106 --> 00:03:32.138
MATT: Yes.

00:03:32.138 --> 00:03:33.731
ASHLEY: I'm drinking out of your mug.

00:03:33.731 --> 00:03:34.622
MATT: She is.

00:03:34.622 --> 00:03:37.862
LIAM: My mug? Here's mine.

00:03:37.862 --> 00:03:39.833
MATT: On river time, there you go.

00:03:39.833 --> 00:03:41.571
MARISHA: On river time, what?

00:03:41.571 --> 00:03:43.414
MATT: That is-- that's a mug.

00:03:43.414 --> 00:03:48.485
MARISHA: Did you instantly turn into a 64-year-old
golfer as soon as you went there?

00:03:48.485 --> 00:03:51.263
LIAM: I'm on a river. I'm on a river.

00:03:51.263 --> 00:03:53.848
LAURA: I'm on a boat. I'm on a boat.

00:03:53.848 --> 00:04:02.552
MATT: So that's going on. Other things we want to
mention. We'll have a special presentation at

00:04:02.552 --> 00:04:09.543
the break today. We're taking a break from the 826LA
charity for another special charity that has been

00:04:09.605 --> 00:04:14.705
running for the past week known as GameChanger:
it's a cancer charity and it's been working in

00:04:14.705 --> 00:04:19.834
conjunction with SquareEnix this past week. To
raise money for cancer research, they've been

00:04:19.834 --> 00:04:26.923
doing-- if you donate $1 to it they're giving away
codes for the first Deus Ex game for PC and a lot

00:04:26.923 --> 00:04:30.779
of other fun stuff. We'll have more information
and a presentation for you at the break. So be

00:04:30.779 --> 00:04:35.156
aware that's the fun charity we're promoting
tonight, so if anyone has the ability to give,

00:04:35.156 --> 00:04:41.115
please do, they're an awesome charity. We're also
waiting on Sam Riegel and Taliesin Jaffe, they're

00:04:41.115 --> 00:04:45.864
both fighting traffic but will be here shortly.
However, let's go ahead and cut to the intro to

00:04:45.864 --> 00:04:49.579
give us a one-minute break, and then we'll jump
right into this crazy, crazy episode. So see you

00:04:49.579 --> 00:04:52.371
in just a moment.

00:04:52.371 --> 00:05:27.206
[no audio]

00:05:27.206 --> 00:05:29.448
Well, while we get that figured out--

00:05:29.448 --> 00:05:30.723
ORION: Oh, is this a podcast now?

00:05:30.723 --> 00:05:31.647
MATT: Apparently.

00:05:31.647 --> 00:05:33.497
ORION: (old-timey voice) Old time radio.

00:05:33.497 --> 00:05:34.919
MARISHA: Well, I think the intro--

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:36.137
MATT: Intro video's frozen.

00:05:36.137 --> 00:05:37.337
ORION: Damn it.

00:05:37.337 --> 00:05:46.727
MATT: Also, this is, as opposed to making it a
surprise, this'll be our last game for a little

00:05:46.742 --> 00:05:48.244
while with--

00:05:48.244 --> 00:05:50.423
LAURA: No, don't say it, don't say it yet.

00:05:50.423 --> 00:05:51.672
MATT: Don't say it-- okay.

00:05:51.672 --> 00:05:52.999
TRAVIS: If you say it, it makes it true.

00:05:52.999 --> 00:05:54.088
MARISHA: Makes it too real.

00:05:54.088 --> 00:05:55.043
MATT: Okay, you're right.

00:05:55.043 --> 00:05:55.799
ORION: Ooh.

00:05:55.799 --> 00:05:57.056
MATT: I'll hold off, all right.

00:05:57.056 --> 00:05:58.832
LIAM: Unfortunately, Travis has to leave the
show.

00:05:58.832 --> 00:06:02.583
MATT: No, that's not true. Grog's ale still needs
to be filled.

00:06:02.583 --> 00:06:03.748
TRAVIS: Smash.

00:06:03.748 --> 00:06:11.010
MATT: Indeed. So we'll patiently wait, folks,
pizza at the ready. Now.

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:12.195
MARISHA: What's going on?

00:06:12.195 --> 00:06:14.172
LIAM: Is there a full table behind this computer?

00:06:14.172 --> 00:06:14.960
LAURA: Pretty much.

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:16.012
MATT: There is, yes.

00:06:16.012 --> 00:06:17.400
LAURA: Travis is directly behind you.

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:20.041
LIAM: Am I in his chest again?

00:06:20.041 --> 00:06:23.505
LAURA: Yeah, you might be even in his face at this
point.

00:06:23.644 --> 00:06:25.946
ORION: It's pretty good, though, I like this
better than the iPad.

00:06:25.946 --> 00:06:27.090
MARISHA: And we can see you more.

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:28.178
LAURA: Can you still see Travis?

00:06:28.178 --> 00:06:29.139
MARISHA AND ORION: Yeah.

00:06:29.139 --> 00:06:29.879
LAURA: Oh.

00:06:29.879 --> 00:06:30.882
MATT: It'll be fine.

00:06:30.882 --> 00:06:31.898
ORION: How can we not see him?

00:06:31.898 --> 00:06:32.702
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughs)

00:06:32.702 --> 00:06:33.402
LAURA: That's true.

00:06:33.402 --> 00:06:34.242
ORION: He's a mountain of man.

00:06:34.242 --> 00:06:35.152
TRAVIS: I am Rushmore.

00:06:35.152 --> 00:06:36.231
MARISHA: Travis takes up this side of the frame.

00:06:36.231 --> 00:06:37.232
ORION: I'm Rushmore.

00:06:37.232 --> 00:06:39.892
MATT: If we're having an issue with the intro
video, do you want to just go to the game?

00:06:39.892 --> 00:06:43.092
TRAVIS: We can do a live intro video.

00:06:43.092 --> 00:06:47.013
ALL: (intro video music)

00:06:47.013 --> 00:06:48.893
MATT: Grog! Goliath Barbarian.

00:06:48.893 --> 00:06:49.942
MARISHA: (crow sound)

00:06:49.942 --> 00:06:51.997
(laughter)

00:06:51.997 --> 00:06:53.235
MATT: -- and we're done.

00:06:53.235 --> 00:06:55.890
TRAVIS: I'd been thinking that this had to happen
at some point.

00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:57.236
MATT: Yeah.

00:06:57.236 --> 00:06:58.847
LAURA: Boomf! I was being you, Tiberius.

00:06:58.847 --> 00:06:59.739
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:06:59.739 --> 00:07:01.120
TRAVIS: We could totally do a Brady Bunch.

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:02.261
MARISHA: Ah ha!

00:07:02.261 --> 00:07:03.069
LAURA: Light!

00:07:03.069 --> 00:07:03.897
MATT: That was pretty good.

00:07:03.897 --> 00:07:05.582
TRAVIS: You guys are on the bottom of the feed,
right?

00:07:05.582 --> 00:07:06.559
ORION: Right.

00:07:06.559 --> 00:07:08.481
TRAVIS: So if you looked up and we looked down,
we'd essentially be looking at each other.

00:07:08.481 --> 00:07:09.441
MARISHA: Oh right, Brady Bunch style!

00:07:09.441 --> 00:07:10.411
LAURA: (gasps) Oh, no way.

00:07:10.411 --> 00:07:11.685
TRAVIS: Oh, hi guys.

00:07:11.685 --> 00:07:12.811
MARISHA: Hi, Travis.

00:07:12.811 --> 00:07:14.041
ORION: Is that how it looks?

00:07:14.041 --> 00:07:16.487
TRAVIS: And then everyone looks to the right to
look at Mercer.

00:07:16.487 --> 00:07:19.212
LAURA: No, yeah, everyone looks to the same--

00:07:19.212 --> 00:07:20.702
TRAVIS: Oh, we look right, you look left.

00:07:20.702 --> 00:07:21.840
TRAVIS AND MATT: No.

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:23.263
MATT: They look right. Everyone looks right.

00:07:23.263 --> 00:07:26.339
MARISHA: Everyone looks right? So if we're looking
this way, "Hi, Matt!"

00:07:26.339 --> 00:07:29.063
MATT: And I disapprovingly look to my left. There
you go.

00:07:29.063 --> 00:07:30.183
ASHLEY: Are we still on?

00:07:30.183 --> 00:07:31.090
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:32.329
ASHLEY: Still going?

00:07:32.329 --> 00:07:33.329
MATT: Real-time Critical Role.

00:07:33.329 --> 00:07:34.282
MARISHA: We're still kind of confused.

00:07:34.282 --> 00:07:35.233
LAURA: I can't tell what happening.

00:07:35.233 --> 00:07:37.092
MATT: So I figure if the intro video's not
working, let's not worry about it. Let's just jump

00:07:37.092 --> 00:07:39.227
into the game and get this started. How about
that?

00:07:39.227 --> 00:07:40.039
TRAVIS: Yeah, why not.

00:07:40.039 --> 00:07:40.931
MATT: Cool with that?

00:07:40.931 --> 00:07:43.034
ASHLEY: Wait, can we show someone that's here
that's really cool?

00:07:43.034 --> 00:07:43.967
MATT: What's up?

00:07:43.967 --> 00:07:45.370
MARISHA: Go ahead and bring him on?

00:07:45.370 --> 00:07:48.082
MATT: Oh, well, we're waiting on the break, unless
you want to do it now.

00:07:48.082 --> 00:07:49.232
ASHLEY: Do it on the break.

00:07:49.232 --> 00:07:50.218
ORION: So we have video problems?

00:07:50.218 --> 00:07:51.620
MARISHA: You can come say hi.

00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:59.389
ORION: I'm Periscope-ing until we're not having
video issues.

00:07:59.389 --> 00:08:01.496
MATT: Well, as far as I know we're on camera.

00:08:01.496 --> 00:08:02.341
ORION: Oh, we are?

00:08:02.341 --> 00:08:03.088
CREW: Yeah.

00:08:03.088 --> 00:08:04.386
MATT: Yeah, just the intro video's not working.

00:08:04.386 --> 00:08:05.406
ORION: Okay.

00:08:05.406 --> 00:08:09.836
MARISHA: Oh, we probably could have been going for
a while. We've just been like dicking around.

00:08:09.836 --> 00:08:11.275
ORION: Bye, guys, we're live.

00:08:11.275 --> 00:08:14.400
MATT: Ah, welcome to the chaos of live internet.
All right, so let's--

00:08:14.410 --> 00:08:16.360
LIAM: I don't think we should go any more meta
than it has to be.

00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:21.321
MATT: Let's jump in, guys. Let's jump in. So a
little bit of overview for those of you who are

00:08:21.321 --> 00:08:26.819
just joining us. At this point in the story, Vox
Machina, this intrepid band of adventurers,

00:08:26.819 --> 00:08:32.604
misfits, whatever you must call them, completed an
adventure through the Underdark, a very dangerous,

00:08:32.604 --> 00:08:33.471
cavernous--

00:08:33.471 --> 00:08:34.577
LAURA: Oh, Sam's here.

00:08:34.577 --> 00:08:35.589
MATT: Oh, we're gonna let Sam in.

00:08:35.589 --> 00:08:36.613
MARISHA: Sam's here!

00:08:36.613 --> 00:08:37.895
ORION: Yeah, he texted.

00:08:37.895 --> 00:08:42.359
MATT: All right, so after completing this
Underdark challenge, they discovered and managed

00:08:42.359 --> 00:08:49.291
to extract an evil artifact known as the Horn of
Orcus that held great power and seemingly has a

00:08:49.291 --> 00:08:55.482
partner somewhere in the world that is unknown.
But the one they have acquired is indestructible,

00:08:55.482 --> 00:08:59.991
as far as folks know, and it was decided by the
Council of Tal'Dorei and Vox Machina that it

00:08:59.991 --> 00:09:06.758
should be sealed away and hopefully forgotten for
the rest of eternity. The best place to do so came

00:09:06.758 --> 00:09:11.449
up in the conversation to be the city of
Vasselheim, which is on a different continent far

00:09:11.449 --> 00:09:15.192
to the northwest of Tal'Dorei, the kingdom where
most of the story as to this point has taken

00:09:15.192 --> 00:09:23.666
place, to be sealed in what is referred to as the
Platinum Sanctuary, the oldest existing temple to

00:09:23.666 --> 00:09:30.585
Bahamut, the good platinum dragon deity. So they
were given passage on a skyship to cross the Ozmit

00:09:30.585 --> 00:09:36.357
Sea to Othanzia, the continent that houses the
capital city, Vasselheim. So the group gathered

00:09:36.357 --> 00:09:43.539
together, rode on to the magically elevated
skyship, and are traversing the ocean carrying the

00:09:43.539 --> 00:09:47.403
Horn of Orcus within this holy container. Hello!

00:09:47.403 --> 00:09:48.774
MARISHA: Hi, Sam.

00:09:48.774 --> 00:09:49.815
MATT: Sam has joined us.

00:09:49.815 --> 00:09:50.914
SAM: Hi!

00:09:50.914 --> 00:09:57.744
MATT: They found themselves over the ocean,
suddenly attacked by a band of what seemed to be wyvern-

00:09:57.807 --> 00:10:03.167
and griffin-riding bandits. The battle took place
on the top of the skyship, some of the magic being

00:10:03.167 --> 00:10:09.258
taken out, a few lives lost, but the party managed
to persevere, take a captive, and continue on

00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:16.105
their journey, the Horn of Orcus and its container
kept safe. And that's where we pick up and begin.

00:10:16.105 --> 00:10:17.929
SAM: Can you say all of that again for me?

00:10:17.929 --> 00:10:19.377
(laughter)

00:10:19.377 --> 00:10:20.868
TRAVIS: You don't listen, anyway.

00:10:20.868 --> 00:10:22.125
MATT: No.

00:10:22.125 --> 00:10:23.938
MARISHA: (laughs) You don't listen, anyway.

00:10:23.938 --> 00:10:32.336
MATT: All righty, so as you guys have settled in,
the Horn safe, you've taken a couple more days on

00:10:32.336 --> 00:10:39.299
this journey, what was told to be about a six-day
journey across the ocean, six to seven days. Is

00:10:39.299 --> 00:10:41.443
there anything you guys wish to accomplish at this
moment?

00:10:41.443 --> 00:10:42.632
SAM: Are we in the air?

00:10:42.632 --> 00:10:43.837
MATT: You are still in the air on the skyship.

00:10:43.837 --> 00:10:44.863
SAM: Not much we can do.

00:10:44.863 --> 00:10:46.657
MARISHA: Well, we just-- so we fought off the
wyverns.

00:10:46.657 --> 00:10:48.409
SAM: Oh, do we have one? We have one.

00:10:48.409 --> 00:10:52.265
TRAVIS: Is the little magician halfling still
being polite and brushing her teeth and stuff?

00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:55.070
LAURA: Oh, that's right, our little halfling that
we--

00:10:55.070 --> 00:10:57.026
TRAVIS: Who you saved. Wuss.

00:10:57.026 --> 00:10:57.921
MATT: Yes.

00:10:57.921 --> 00:10:59.105
SAM: She's a mage, right?

00:10:59.105 --> 00:11:03.782
MATT: That you saved. She is a mage, and she has
also been bound, at the orders of the captain, so

00:11:03.782 --> 00:11:07.371
as not to cause any issues on the ship while she's
there. So as to her future, after your

00:11:07.371 --> 00:11:12.422
conversation with him, as to whether or not she
could work on this ship, based on the fact that

00:11:12.422 --> 00:11:17.104
their first meeting involved her and her band
attacking and trying to murder his entire crew,

00:11:17.104 --> 00:11:23.490
Captain Damon was not too keen on the idea at the
time being and decided to lock her up.

00:11:23.490 --> 00:11:24.558
LAURA: Oh.

00:11:24.558 --> 00:11:26.299
MATT: So. We shall see her fate in the near
future.

00:11:26.299 --> 00:11:27.273
TRAVIS: She's locked up.

00:11:27.273 --> 00:11:28.260
LAURA: Okay. She's locked up.

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:29.464
TRAVIS: She's got tricks, though, right?

00:11:29.464 --> 00:11:33.151
MATT: She has tricks, but there is an anti-magic
brig built into the ship specifically

00:11:33.151 --> 00:11:34.128
for this purpose.

00:11:34.128 --> 00:11:35.293
SAM: Ooh. Fancy.

00:11:35.293 --> 00:11:36.993
TRAVIS: That's all I needed to know.

00:11:37.063 --> 00:11:39.860
LAURA: Oh, that's good to know. I was going to pay
you to put the kibosh on her.

00:11:39.905 --> 00:11:41.239
ORION: She's negged.

00:11:41.239 --> 00:11:42.312
TRAVIS: Cool.

00:11:42.312 --> 00:11:47.271
MATT: (laughs) So. I'll say that Percy is
continuing to read his book. The next few days

00:11:47.271 --> 00:11:50.073
pass without incident. Is there anything you want
to accomplish? Anything?

00:11:50.073 --> 00:11:52.925
ORION: You said the next few days without
incident? Cool.

00:11:52.925 --> 00:11:54.540
TRAVIS: Could I try to further my beard?

00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:55.696
SAM: Oh, yes! Try to grow a beard.

00:11:55.696 --> 00:11:56.890
MARISHA: Yeah, his beard. Let's go for the beard.

00:11:56.890 --> 00:11:58.086
MATT: Go ahead and roll another percentage dice.

00:11:58.086 --> 00:11:59.442
TRAVIS: Yeah! It's a d20, right?

00:11:59.442 --> 00:12:00.479
LAURA: It's a percentage die.

00:12:00.479 --> 00:12:02.222
TRAVIS: Oh, that's right, that's right. The two in
a row. I remember.

00:12:02.222 --> 00:12:03.070
MATT: Two d10s.

00:12:03.070 --> 00:12:04.569
TRAVIS: I'm learning. I'm learning.

00:12:04.569 --> 00:12:05.525
MARISHA: Yep.

00:12:05.525 --> 00:12:06.733
MATT: First one and the second one.

00:12:06.733 --> 00:12:07.877
TRAVIS: Three. Eight.

00:12:07.877 --> 00:12:12.865
MATT: 38. The little bit of peach-fuzz stubble on
the chin of your goliath face begins to slowly

00:12:12.865 --> 00:12:18.134
grow. It's coming out colorless. It's almost
translucent with a hint of gray and white.

00:12:18.134 --> 00:12:19.342
SAM and LAURA: Ew.

00:12:19.442 --> 00:12:21.028
TRAVIS: I'm a Targaryen, baby.

00:12:21.028 --> 00:12:22.177
(laughter)

00:12:22.177 --> 00:12:23.320
LIAM: That's hot.

00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:24.732
LAURA: It's translucent, like--

00:12:24.732 --> 00:12:29.552
MATT: A color is there. It's almost like fishing
line is growing out of the bottom of his chin.

00:12:29.552 --> 00:12:30.417
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:12:30.417 --> 00:12:31.278
SAM: Ugh.

00:12:31.278 --> 00:12:32.092
ASHLEY: Whoa.

00:12:32.092 --> 00:12:33.068
TRAVIS: Don't be jealous.

00:12:33.068 --> 00:12:34.735
ASHLEY: Grog, it's sparkling. It's sparkling!

00:12:34.735 --> 00:12:35.884
LAURA: It's really creepy, Grog.

00:12:35.884 --> 00:12:37.452
ASHLEY: Hey, I feel it. It's like sandpaper, a
little bit.

00:12:37.452 --> 00:12:38.610
TRAVIS: Thank you. Thank you.

00:12:38.610 --> 00:12:42.773
MATT: Keep in mind, goliaths, predominantly--
especially pureblood goliaths-- do not grow facial

00:12:42.773 --> 00:12:48.420
hair. The fact that this magical feat is even
achieving any modicum of growth is in itself an

00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:52.038
arcane marvel, and who knows what detrimental
effects this may have in the long run, going

00:12:52.038 --> 00:12:53.856
against your physiology.

00:12:53.856 --> 00:12:59.643
TRAVIS: Oh, crap. It's all right. It'll make me
look really wise, you guys. Nobody will know.

00:12:59.643 --> 00:13:03.861
MARISHA: I have some beads. If you want, we can
braid it and put beads in there.

00:13:03.861 --> 00:13:04.861
LAURA: Ooh.

00:13:04.861 --> 00:13:06.798
TRAVIS: I'm all about it. Beads and bells and
shit?

00:13:06.798 --> 00:13:07.715
MARISHA: Okay!

00:13:07.715 --> 00:13:08.946
MARISHA: I braid Grog's beard.

00:13:08.946 --> 00:13:10.347
TRAVIS: Give me a staff and I'll be Gandalf.

00:13:10.347 --> 00:13:11.310
MATT: All right.

00:13:11.310 --> 00:13:13.416
MARISHA: And put beads in it. And a few flowers,
as well.

00:13:13.416 --> 00:13:14.606
TRAVIS: Wait! Ooh, weird.

00:13:14.606 --> 00:13:16.174
MARISHA: It looks nice.

00:13:16.174 --> 00:13:17.392
TRAVIS: All right.

00:13:17.392 --> 00:13:23.235
MATT: It takes you a lot of concentration to try
and get any sort of braidage through the about an

00:13:23.235 --> 00:13:25.679
inch to inch and a half facial hair that is
growing from his chin.

00:13:25.679 --> 00:13:26.808
MARISHA: Looks good!

00:13:26.808 --> 00:13:29.329
TRAVIS: It's really tight when you braid it like
that. It pinches.

00:13:29.329 --> 00:13:30.459
MARISHA: You'll get used to it.

00:13:30.459 --> 00:13:33.022
LAURA: Maybe you can cast Grasping Vine on his
chin and grow it out.

00:13:33.022 --> 00:13:34.769
MATT: What could possibly go wrong?

00:13:34.769 --> 00:13:36.049
(laughter)

00:13:36.049 --> 00:13:38.631
TRAVIS: Do it. Could be great.

00:13:38.631 --> 00:13:40.237
ORION: I suggest against this.

00:13:40.237 --> 00:13:41.635
TRAVIS: I thought you suggest violence.

00:13:41.635 --> 00:13:42.807
ORION: No.

00:13:42.807 --> 00:13:44.083
SAM: He encourages violence.

00:13:44.083 --> 00:13:45.341
LAURA: I encourage violence.

00:13:45.341 --> 00:13:46.509
ORION: I'm against this.

00:13:46.509 --> 00:13:47.607
ASHLEY: Is it just violence?

00:13:47.607 --> 00:13:48.790
LAURA: So we're healed. We're healed, right?

00:13:48.790 --> 00:13:49.717
SAM: Oh, days have gone by, right?

00:13:49.717 --> 00:13:51.676
MATT: Yeah, you guys have rested. Days have gone
by, your spells have returned to you--

00:13:51.676 --> 00:13:53.839
LIAM: Hey, DM, days have gone by?

00:13:53.839 --> 00:13:55.207
LAURA: Trinket's feeling good.

00:13:55.207 --> 00:13:57.436
MATT: Days have gone by at this time. You've
continued traveling over the Ozmit Sea.

00:13:57.436 --> 00:13:59.331
ORION: Are we nearing the destination?

00:13:59.331 --> 00:14:01.877
MATT: I'll get to that in just a second. Do you
have a question, Liam?

00:14:01.877 --> 00:14:09.525
LIAM: No, not a question, but last night while
Grog was sleeping-- I can see right up Grog's

00:14:09.525 --> 00:14:17.669
nose. While Grog was sleeping, I went and got a
bit of rope from the ship and used my disguise kit

00:14:17.669 --> 00:14:24.919
that I have. I sort of frayed a part of the rope
and spent about an hour using spirit gum to glue

00:14:24.919 --> 00:14:35.837
bits of frayed rope to Grog's chin into a small
Gilmore-esque goatee. And he didn't seem to wake

00:14:35.837 --> 00:14:39.083
up, and I'd like to see how that worked out.

00:14:39.083 --> 00:14:41.873
MATT: (laughs) All righty.

00:14:41.873 --> 00:14:49.222
TRAVIS: I'm gonna do a sleep check or something,
right? I can't let him survive that.

00:14:49.222 --> 00:14:52.576
MATT: For this, go ahead and make a perception
check with disadvantage.

00:14:52.576 --> 00:14:53.940
TRAVIS: With disadvantage?!

00:14:53.940 --> 00:14:55.847
SAM: Because you're asleep!

00:14:55.847 --> 00:14:56.791
TRAVIS: One.

00:14:56.791 --> 00:14:59.848
(laughter)

00:14:59.848 --> 00:15:01.077
ORION: Get it out now.

00:15:01.077 --> 00:15:04.478
MATT: You wake up the following morning and
immediately run to the nearest reflective surface

00:15:04.638 --> 00:15:11.314
to check on yourself, and you have a glorious,
dark brown, well-braided, mildly frayed, thick,

00:15:11.314 --> 00:15:14.771
coarse goatee braid. It goes about a good three to
four inches from the bottom of your chin. And you

00:15:14.771 --> 00:15:15.928
are very proud.

00:15:15.928 --> 00:15:19.410
TRAVIS: I knew it! I knew it! I am a special boy.
(laughs)

00:15:19.410 --> 00:15:21.314
(laughter)

00:15:21.314 --> 00:15:27.249
TRAVIS: Only this one strand is this color and
everything else is white and translucent,

00:15:27.249 --> 00:15:28.544
whatever--

00:15:28.544 --> 00:15:29.701
ORION: I think it looks good on you, Grog.

00:15:29.701 --> 00:15:30.683
TRAVIS: Thank you!

00:15:30.683 --> 00:15:32.514
I wave my head and it whips around.

00:15:32.723 --> 00:15:33.889
ASHLEY: (sings) I whip my beard back and forth.

00:15:33.889 --> 00:15:35.412
TRAVIS: (sings) I whip my beard back and forth.

00:15:35.412 --> 00:15:45.446
MATT: It stays taut on your chin. All right, so as
you reach the middle of the sixth day of travel,

00:15:45.446 --> 00:15:51.209
the sky, which up to this point had been fairly
sunny and clear, begins to slowly cloud over. The

00:15:51.209 --> 00:15:57.726
weather grows more gray, and the clouds themselves
seem to cluster more into-- I wouldn't say a

00:15:57.726 --> 00:16:01.552
stormfront, but definitely a more gloomy
atmosphere.

00:16:01.552 --> 00:16:05.859
MARISHA: Can I do a nature check to see if this
seems to be natural or arcane?

00:16:05.859 --> 00:16:07.133
MATT: Certainly.

00:16:07.133 --> 00:16:10.728
ORION: Nice.

00:16:10.728 --> 00:16:13.208
LAURA: (sings) With her big fancy die!

00:16:13.208 --> 00:16:15.162
MARISHA: Okay, that's a 10 plus-- 20, total.

00:16:15.162 --> 00:16:19.322
MATT: All right. Looking at these clouds, it is a
slow formation, and they aren't moving at an

00:16:19.322 --> 00:16:25.000
unnecessary speed or seem to have any ominous
press towards you. It just seems like the weather

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.735
itself towards this northern continent seems to be
of a colder variety.

00:16:28.891 --> 00:16:36.355
ORION: I'm going to sense the weather, I suppose,
because this doesn't look fun.

00:16:36.355 --> 00:16:38.662
MATT: Okay. The weather is cold.

00:16:38.662 --> 00:16:40.684
ORION: Ooh, it's cold.

00:16:40.684 --> 00:16:42.527
TRAVIS: So the weather outside is frightful?

00:16:42.527 --> 00:16:45.042
LAURA: Good call, Tiberius. Good call. I agree, it
is rather cold.

00:16:45.042 --> 00:16:47.122
ORION: I don't like this. Scanlan.

00:16:47.122 --> 00:16:48.360
SAM: Oi?

00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:56.137
ORION: Like we were discussing earlier, would you
be interested in the still-standing trade of my

00:16:56.137 --> 00:16:59.319
Ioun Stone for your circlet-crown thingy?

00:16:59.319 --> 00:17:05.029
SAM: Oh, you know what, Tiberius, I have been
giving this a lot of thought and consideration.

00:17:05.029 --> 00:17:06.656
What's for lunch?

00:17:06.656 --> 00:17:10.953
ORION: What would you like for lunch? I already
ate.

00:17:10.953 --> 00:17:13.262
SAM: Oh. No. No, I was done with the
conversation.

00:17:13.262 --> 00:17:14.355
TRAVIS: Oh, good diss.

00:17:14.355 --> 00:17:15.894
LAURA AND ASHLEY: Oh.

00:17:15.894 --> 00:17:21.960
ORION: Well. Keyleth, if you could put a little
slate up for me, I'd like to illustrate something

00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:26.799
for little Scanlan. And perhaps his tiny mind can
comprehend it. (clears throat)

00:17:26.799 --> 00:17:28.080
LAURA: Ooh!

00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:29.521
ASHLEY: Hey, that's rude.

00:17:29.521 --> 00:17:32.028
ORION: Would you, perhaps, do this?

00:17:32.028 --> 00:17:36.267
LAURA: His tiny mind is exactly proportionate for
the rest of his body, Tiberius.

00:17:36.267 --> 00:17:38.506
SAM: Well, not the entire body.

00:17:38.506 --> 00:17:41.406
ORION: I'm going to walk up to the hull and be
like--

00:17:41.406 --> 00:17:44.776
MARISHA: No! Write it right here! I throw up a
slate.

00:17:44.776 --> 00:17:45.887
ORION: Oh. (clears throat)

00:17:45.887 --> 00:17:50.345
MATT: Okay. It's the strangest wall you've
constructed, as up in the air on the ship that is

00:17:50.345 --> 00:17:54.517
mostly constructed out of iron and metal, there is
little to no stone available of which you can

00:17:54.517 --> 00:18:00.091
sprout a Wall of Stone. However, there are weights
set up on top, so what you create is less of a

00:18:00.091 --> 00:18:08.133
smooth Wall of Stone and more of a very thin,
brittle shale wall that may function for the time

00:18:08.133 --> 00:18:10.897
being, but probably won't stand up for more than
five to ten minutes.

00:18:10.897 --> 00:18:13.453
ORION: I see. Prestidigitation. Some chalk.

00:18:13.453 --> 00:18:15.427
MATT: All right.

00:18:15.427 --> 00:18:21.534
ORION: You see, Scanlan, you've had this
particular piece for over ten, let's say, matches

00:18:21.534 --> 00:18:34.169
or weeks. You have used it zero times. In over six
battles, over the same course,

00:18:34.169 --> 00:18:36.586
using it zero times.

00:18:36.586 --> 00:18:38.031
(laughter)

00:18:38.031 --> 00:18:42.186
ORION: I, being a sorcerer, have a special ability
called sorcerer points, where I can do multiple

00:18:42.186 --> 00:18:44.104
spells in a single round.

00:18:44.104 --> 00:18:45.174
SAM: Yes.

00:18:45.174 --> 00:18:47.500
ORION: Which none of you can do. Other than monks,
of course.

00:18:47.500 --> 00:18:50.845
LAURA: That's true. Brag about it, Tiberius. Just
keep bragging about it.

00:18:50.845 --> 00:18:58.494
ORION: When I can do multiple spells, like two,
versus you, who can do one, that means that I can

00:18:58.494 --> 00:19:00.775
do one more spell than you can per round.

00:19:00.775 --> 00:19:01.997
(laughter)

00:19:01.997 --> 00:19:02.972
SAM: All right.

00:19:02.972 --> 00:19:05.855
ORION: And every round after that. One hundred
percent.

00:19:05.855 --> 00:19:08.200
(laughter)

00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:09.964
SAM: This is amazing.

00:19:09.964 --> 00:19:18.071
ORION: Your utilization of the actual item has
been equivalent to nothing. In the interest of the

00:19:18.071 --> 00:19:24.863
group and the use of items in general, it would be
wise to switch it, because you have needed extra

00:19:24.863 --> 00:19:26.366
spells like Invisibility--

00:19:26.366 --> 00:19:28.827
MATT: The shale wall cracks.

00:19:28.827 --> 00:19:30.281
(laughter)

00:19:30.281 --> 00:19:31.944
ORION: Several times.

00:19:31.944 --> 00:19:33.283
MARISHA: I'm sorry.

00:19:33.283 --> 00:19:35.872
ORION: Where my item would be more useful in
general to you.

00:19:35.872 --> 00:19:41.463
LIAM: May I ask, is magical ability inversely
proportionate to wisdom?

00:19:41.463 --> 00:19:43.515
ORION: Oh, me?

00:19:43.515 --> 00:19:44.957
SAM: Who are you asking?

00:19:44.957 --> 00:19:47.314
ASHLEY: Is magical ability inversely proportionate
to wisdom?

00:19:47.314 --> 00:19:52.354
ORION: Absolutely not. I am one of the strongest
casters in all of Draconia, and it only takes the

00:19:52.354 --> 00:19:54.999
strength of my charisma to do my stuff.

00:19:54.999 --> 00:20:00.569
LAURA: Oh. Everything makes sense now, Tiberius.

00:20:00.569 --> 00:20:04.755
TRAVIS: So are you saying you want what he has
back?

00:20:04.907 --> 00:20:08.413
SAM: (laughs) I didn't recognize you, Grog. Is
that you?

00:20:08.413 --> 00:20:10.856
TRAVIS: It is I, Brad Pitt from Legends of the
Fall.

00:20:10.856 --> 00:20:12.817
(laughter)

00:20:12.817 --> 00:20:14.339
TRAVIS: My beard of glory.

00:20:14.339 --> 00:20:16.536
ORION: That is a movie.

00:20:16.536 --> 00:20:18.890
TRAVIS: It's an old bard's tale.

00:20:18.890 --> 00:20:22.247
ORION: So, Scanlan. What say you?

00:20:22.247 --> 00:20:27.351
SAM: Your mathematical skills have been quite
impressive.

00:20:27.351 --> 00:20:30.073
ORION: I don't like to show them off.

00:20:30.073 --> 00:20:36.487
SAM: No, no. For a man of such low wisdom, you are
proving wiser than I ever imagined.

00:20:36.487 --> 00:20:38.453
(laughter)

00:20:38.453 --> 00:20:44.748
SAM: I will gladly make this trade with you. You
have convinced me.

00:20:44.748 --> 00:20:45.585
LAURA: Hey.

00:20:45.585 --> 00:20:46.381
MARISHA: Aww.

00:20:46.381 --> 00:20:47.510
ORION: Oh, wonderful. Thank you.

00:20:47.510 --> 00:20:48.580
SAM: Yes. Yes.

00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:49.288
ASHLEY: Hey.

00:20:49.288 --> 00:20:50.109
LAURA: That's wonderful.

00:20:50.109 --> 00:20:51.175
SAM: All right. Hugs, hugs, hugs.

00:20:51.175 --> 00:20:52.275
(laughter)

00:20:52.275 --> 00:20:53.787
ORION: (explosion sound)

00:20:53.787 --> 00:20:55.580
SAM: Now, what does this thing do?

00:20:55.580 --> 00:20:59.957
ORION: Now you can store up to three level spells.
Three of them in there.

00:20:59.957 --> 00:21:01.482
LAURA: Oh, it's better than the Pearl of Power!

00:21:01.482 --> 00:21:04.284
ORION: And you don't have to expend spell slots to
do the spells.

00:21:04.284 --> 00:21:05.897
SAM: All right. Thank you very much.

00:21:05.897 --> 00:21:06.894
ASHLEY: Hey.

00:21:06.894 --> 00:21:07.891
LAURA: That's a good trade.

00:21:07.891 --> 00:21:08.978
TRAVIS: Oh my god, that was so good.

00:21:08.978 --> 00:21:10.176
ASHLEY: That was amazing.

00:21:10.176 --> 00:21:11.562
ORION: You can put three Lightning Bolts in there
and it costs nothing.

00:21:11.562 --> 00:21:12.853
ASHLEY: Oh, math!

00:21:12.853 --> 00:21:15.795
SAM: All right, all right. I'm man enough to admit
that he's convinced me.

00:21:15.795 --> 00:21:17.956
TRAVIS: That was so good.

00:21:17.956 --> 00:21:19.231
ASHLEY: That was awesome.

00:21:19.231 --> 00:21:21.964
TRAVIS: I don't know what you wrote, but it looked
good.

00:21:21.964 --> 00:21:23.251
MARISHA: Oh, man.

00:21:23.251 --> 00:21:24.573
ORION: I'm sorry.

00:21:24.573 --> 00:21:28.290
MATT: The Ioun Stone which you had taken, you
place by your head and release. It seems to fix

00:21:28.290 --> 00:21:30.762
itself in the air and slowly rotate above your
head.

00:21:30.762 --> 00:21:31.823
ORION: It orbits.

00:21:31.823 --> 00:21:33.819
MATT: Almost held in its own orbital gravity
around your head.

00:21:33.819 --> 00:21:34.568
LAURA: Ooh.

00:21:34.568 --> 00:21:35.736
SAM: Pike.

00:21:35.736 --> 00:21:38.873
ASHLEY: Oh. (laughs) Oh, wow. It's like you have a
halo.

00:21:38.873 --> 00:21:39.882
ORION: It is fancy.

00:21:39.882 --> 00:21:45.788
SAM: It's like a halo. Like your god has smiled on
me, maybe, and said, "He's cool. Go for it."

00:21:45.788 --> 00:21:49.228
ASHLEY: Oh, wow. Well, I don't know if that's what
it means.

00:21:49.228 --> 00:21:54.790
SAM: Well. You know, religion is up to
interpretation, so I interpret it that way.

00:21:54.790 --> 00:21:56.533
ASHLEY: It is very cool-looking.

00:21:56.533 --> 00:21:58.402
SAM: Thank you, Pike.

00:21:58.402 --> 00:22:02.907
TRAVIS: (laughs) So casual, her god. "It's cool.
Go for it."

00:22:02.907 --> 00:22:08.651
MATT: (laughs) Sarenrae. The she-bro you never
had.

00:22:08.651 --> 00:22:10.074
(laughter)

00:22:10.074 --> 00:22:11.763
SAM: Sarenrae's my wingman.

00:22:11.763 --> 00:22:14.050
ASHLEY: We cool, Sarenrae.

00:22:14.050 --> 00:22:15.248
TRAVIS: I can't breathe.

00:22:15.248 --> 00:22:21.576
MATT: Many a cart hold that bumper sticker. All
right, so as this conversation comes to a close,

00:22:21.635 --> 00:22:27.149
the temperature in the sky has gotten noticeably
chillier. And you swear for an instant you start

00:22:27.149 --> 00:22:32.106
seeing what looks like specks of white snow
beginning to drift from the clouds ahead.

00:22:32.106 --> 00:22:33.918
MARISHA: (gasps) It's snowing.

00:22:33.918 --> 00:22:35.113
LAURA: It's snow, Keyleth.

00:22:35.113 --> 00:22:38.721
SAM: (sings) I'm dreaming of a white
whatever-we-celebrate.

00:22:38.721 --> 00:22:40.436
TRAVIS: Festivus!

00:22:40.436 --> 00:22:41.678
ORION: Festivus.

00:22:41.678 --> 00:22:50.924
MARISHA: There was something I should probably
tell you. In this area of land, in Vasselheim, on

00:22:50.924 --> 00:22:59.203
this continent, somewhere, I'm not sure where,
resides the Fire Ashari. Somewhere in

00:22:59.203 --> 00:23:00.484
the town of Pyrah.

00:23:00.484 --> 00:23:01.463
LAURA: What's that?

00:23:01.463 --> 00:23:02.309
ASHLEY: Ooh.

00:23:02.309 --> 00:23:03.488
LAURA: What are Fire Ashari?

00:23:03.488 --> 00:23:07.386
MARISHA: Well, they're my sister tribe. They're a
part of my sister tribe. I come

00:23:07.386 --> 00:23:08.563
from the Air Ashari.

00:23:08.563 --> 00:23:09.294
LAURA: Right.

00:23:09.294 --> 00:23:10.154
TRAVIS: Uh-huh.

00:23:10.154 --> 00:23:11.254
MARISHA: Yeah, from Zephra.

00:23:11.254 --> 00:23:12.305
ASHLEY: (whispers) Fire Ashari?

00:23:12.305 --> 00:23:13.256
LAURA: So they-- oh.

00:23:13.256 --> 00:23:15.942
MARISHA: Yeah, so there are Fire Ashari. So the
point behind the Ashari-- I'm not sure I have

00:23:15.942 --> 00:23:25.052
expressed this to you all in the past few months.
The point of our tribe is we sought out the

00:23:25.052 --> 00:23:32.053
weakest points where the elemental planes start to
bleed with our plane of existence, and these

00:23:32.053 --> 00:23:37.959
planes need to be protected, so our people have
sought them all out in order to make haven there

00:23:37.959 --> 00:23:43.809
and be the protectors that we were all born to be.
And as part of my Aramente, I have to seek out

00:23:43.809 --> 00:23:48.536
each of the headmasters and prove myself a worthy
leader.

00:23:48.536 --> 00:23:49.591
TRAVIS: Ooh.

00:23:49.591 --> 00:23:51.357
MARISHA: Which makes me really nervous.

00:23:51.357 --> 00:23:54.675
LAURA: We've got your back, Keyleth.

00:23:54.675 --> 00:23:56.076
ASHLEY: Oh, you'll do it. You'll totally do it.

00:23:56.076 --> 00:23:57.788
TRAVIS: Yeah. Yeah, we can burn shit for days.

00:23:57.788 --> 00:24:04.464
MARISHA: So I just thought, you know, maybe after
we handle the Horn, maybe we can pop in. You know,

00:24:04.464 --> 00:24:05.577
since we're here.

00:24:05.577 --> 00:24:08.997
LAURA: Totally. You know, if you want to, Keyleth,
when we go, we'll all follow your orders and make

00:24:08.997 --> 00:24:11.072
it seem like you're an extraordinary leader of
us.

00:24:11.072 --> 00:24:12.206
TRAVIS: Ooh, yeah.

00:24:12.206 --> 00:24:14.438
MARISHA: Oh. That could be good. Oh, that sounds
fun!

00:24:14.438 --> 00:24:17.660
ORION: Oh. Good idea, yes. Of course, I will be
your mage guard.

00:24:17.660 --> 00:24:19.922
TRAVIS: Do they make you burn things as a display
of your abilities?

00:24:19.922 --> 00:24:21.592
MARISHA: Well, they kind of teach me new things.

00:24:21.592 --> 00:24:22.523
LAURA: Ooh!

00:24:22.523 --> 00:24:24.218
MARISHA: They kind of instill me with their
knowledge.

00:24:24.218 --> 00:24:26.395
LAURA: So the tornado thing. You could be like a
fire tornado?

00:24:26.395 --> 00:24:28.256
MARISHA: I could. I know!

00:24:28.256 --> 00:24:29.203
TRAVIS: Shut up!

00:24:29.203 --> 00:24:36.171
MARISHA: I'm so excited! But yes. Super nervous,
because social skills aren't my strongest suit.

00:24:36.171 --> 00:24:37.168
LAURA: We've noticed.

00:24:37.168 --> 00:24:38.545
TRAVIS: You're a natural. You're great.

00:24:38.545 --> 00:24:39.689
LAURA: You're great, though.

00:24:39.689 --> 00:24:40.835
MARISHA: Oh, you guys.

00:24:40.835 --> 00:24:41.951
ASHLEY: But it's very charming.

00:24:41.951 --> 00:24:44.015
TRAVIS: We gotta go there. It's fire everywhere!

00:24:44.015 --> 00:24:45.485
ORION: (laughs) Oh.

00:24:45.485 --> 00:24:46.650
MARISHA: Yes. Yes.

00:24:46.650 --> 00:24:49.296
LIAM: Is everything copacetic between the
different tribes?

00:24:49.296 --> 00:24:50.486
TRAVIS: Oh, good question.

00:24:50.486 --> 00:24:51.757
MARISHA: What? What?

00:24:51.757 --> 00:24:52.660
TRAVIS: Is it copacetic?

00:24:52.660 --> 00:24:53.712
LAURA: Are you guys friendly with each other?

00:24:53.712 --> 00:24:54.604
LIAM: Are they happy?

00:24:54.604 --> 00:24:55.461
ORION: The tribes.

00:24:55.461 --> 00:24:58.717
MARISHA: Well, yes. Yeah, no, we're all happy. I
mean, that's kind of the thing, where once a

00:24:58.717 --> 00:25:03.810
generation someone sets out and goes on the
Aramente in order to come back a headmaster, and

00:25:03.810 --> 00:25:10.351
it's kind of like our once-a-generation check-in,
if you will, to make sure everything's okay.

00:25:10.415 --> 00:25:12.920
TRAVIS: Exchange students.

00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:17.632
MARISHA: Unfortunately, the last person to go on
the Aramente didn't come back, which happens

00:25:17.632 --> 00:25:18.862
sometimes. Yeah.

00:25:18.862 --> 00:25:23.299
TRAVIS: Like, didn't come back ever?

00:25:23.299 --> 00:25:24.629
MARISHA: No.

00:25:24.629 --> 00:25:26.294
LAURA: So, like, you could die?

00:25:26.294 --> 00:25:28.820
ORION: Or maybe they got lost to the winds of the
road.

00:25:28.820 --> 00:25:29.998
TRAVIS: Right, yeah.

00:25:29.998 --> 00:25:32.104
MARISHA: It was actually my mother.

00:25:32.104 --> 00:25:33.777
ORION: Oh, goodness.

00:25:33.777 --> 00:25:34.764
LAURA: (gasps) What?

00:25:34.764 --> 00:25:36.028
TRAVIS: To which tribe?

00:25:36.028 --> 00:25:43.203
MARISHA: I-- we don't know. She left when I was a
little girl, so I don't remember much. So I don't

00:25:43.203 --> 00:25:45.864
know if she's alive or dead, really, but--

00:25:45.864 --> 00:25:47.055
LAURA: Keyleth.

00:25:47.055 --> 00:25:48.837
TRAVIS: We did not know that.

00:25:48.837 --> 00:25:51.055
MARISHA: It's okay. It's okay.

00:25:51.055 --> 00:25:52.295
TRAVIS: Yeah, no bigs, right?

00:25:52.295 --> 00:25:53.139
LAURA: Yeah.

00:25:53.139 --> 00:25:54.309
TRAVIS: Just your mother.

00:25:54.309 --> 00:26:00.065
MARISHA: I mean, it's-- I mean. Well. It's fine.
It's just. It's weird. I haven't seen her, so I

00:26:00.065 --> 00:26:00.957
don't know.

00:26:00.957 --> 00:26:01.959
SAM: Awkward.

00:26:01.959 --> 00:26:03.066
MARISHA: I barely remember her.

00:26:03.066 --> 00:26:06.054
TRAVIS: Do you think there's a chance of when we
visit this place, we might have to defend

00:26:06.054 --> 00:26:07.214
ourselves?

00:26:07.214 --> 00:26:09.240
MARISHA: No. No. I wouldn't think so.

00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:10.817
ORION: Which means "of course."

00:26:10.817 --> 00:26:12.860
LAURA: It's not like your family, Grog. They're
actually nice.

00:26:12.860 --> 00:26:14.202
MARISHA: Yeah, we're pretty-- we're cool.

00:26:14.202 --> 00:26:18.833
TRAVIS: Look, my family is nice, too. We just
share love with fists.

00:26:18.833 --> 00:26:20.978
ORION: Understandable.

00:26:20.978 --> 00:26:23.184
LAURA: That sounds wrong in so many ways.

00:26:23.184 --> 00:26:24.656
TRAVIS: It does, actually.

00:26:24.656 --> 00:26:30.927
LIAM: Keyleth, did your mother have to go alone,
or does your tribe permit there to

00:26:30.927 --> 00:26:34.121
be help for you?

00:26:34.121 --> 00:26:37.417
MARISHA: I'm assuming it would be okay. We're
pretty welcoming.

00:26:37.417 --> 00:26:38.621
LAURA: That's good.

00:26:38.621 --> 00:26:39.859
TRAVIS: Yeah, we should totally be there.

00:26:39.859 --> 00:26:41.402
LAURA: All right. We will go.

00:26:41.402 --> 00:26:42.009
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:26:42.009 --> 00:26:43.283
TRAVIS: And maybe ask them if they've seen your
mom.

00:26:43.283 --> 00:26:44.344
MARISHA: Yeah. That'd be interesting.

00:26:44.344 --> 00:26:45.193
LAURA: Yeah.

00:26:45.193 --> 00:26:49.154
MARISHA: It's weird. There's this part of me in
the back of my head that kind of always wonders if

00:26:49.154 --> 00:26:51.139
I'm going to run into her.

00:26:51.201 --> 00:26:54.760
TRAVIS: How old-- when was the last time you saw
your mother, or do you even remember?

00:26:54.760 --> 00:26:58.808
MARISHA: I was five, six maybe, years old when she
left.

00:26:58.808 --> 00:26:59.959
TRAVIS: Wow.

00:26:59.959 --> 00:27:02.326
MARISHA: So I'm the next in line.

00:27:02.326 --> 00:27:04.033
LAURA: (whispers) Wow.

00:27:04.033 --> 00:27:05.274
SAM: This is heavy.

00:27:05.274 --> 00:27:06.177
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:27:06.177 --> 00:27:07.284
ASHLEY: This is very heavy.

00:27:07.284 --> 00:27:08.289
MARISHA: I'm sorry. I didn't mean to bring the
mood down.

00:27:08.289 --> 00:27:09.595
SAM: No, it's fine. It's good to know this.

00:27:09.595 --> 00:27:11.768
MARISHA: I'm just letting you know that we're
going to be in that neck of the woods,

00:27:11.768 --> 00:27:13.048
so I should probably--

00:27:13.048 --> 00:27:13.783
LAURA: Stop by.

00:27:13.783 --> 00:27:14.542
ASHLEY: Yes.

00:27:14.542 --> 00:27:15.502
MARISHA: -- you know, go.

00:27:15.502 --> 00:27:16.175
TRAVIS: Absolutely.

00:27:16.175 --> 00:27:17.167
LAURA: Give a little hello.

00:27:17.249 --> 00:27:19.804
MATT: "Land sighted!" A voice breaks out from 
the side of the ship's bow.

00:27:19.853 --> 00:27:20.615
ORION: Ooh.

00:27:20.615 --> 00:27:25.829
MATT: You guys glance over quickly to the edge of
the skyship, and you see, right over the edge of

00:27:25.829 --> 00:27:33.868
Deera, what looks to be this ominous continent
slowly approaching. Through the mists, the low

00:27:33.868 --> 00:27:38.165
clouds of this area, you can make out what looks
to be a fairly heavily wooded and overgrown

00:27:38.165 --> 00:27:44.037
landscape. You can see dark forest peppered with a
little bit of snowfall across the top.

00:27:44.037 --> 00:27:45.489
LAURA: My kind of place.

00:27:45.489 --> 00:27:49.089
MATT: Occasional mountaintops and peaks breaking
through the canopy of the distant forest.

00:27:49.089 --> 00:27:51.169
LAURA: Look, Trinket! Home.

00:27:51.169 --> 00:27:59.415
MATT: Trinket looms up to the side and looks a bit
chilly and shakes it off. At which point, Kima

00:27:59.415 --> 00:28:04.788
comes up and joins the rest of you. Puts her
elbows over and looks off wistfully for a second

00:28:04.788 --> 00:28:13.541
and goes, (sighs) "It's been some time. Welcome to
Othanzia, folks. It's an interesting place."

00:28:13.541 --> 00:28:14.675
TRAVIS: It is, isn't it?

00:28:14.675 --> 00:28:16.052
LAURA: We'll follow your lead.

00:28:16.052 --> 00:28:23.713
MATT: She points off, says, "This forest here we
refer to as the Vesper Timberland, and it goes for

00:28:23.913 --> 00:28:30.984
"miles and miles and miles before bleeding into
endless tundra to the north, so let's hopefully

00:28:30.984 --> 00:28:39.345
"not travel that far." (sighs) "This'll be
interesting." And she turns around and heads back

00:28:39.345 --> 00:28:41.778
down into the ship. As you continue--

00:28:41.778 --> 00:28:42.730
LAURA: Good talk!

00:28:42.730 --> 00:28:44.576
MARISHA: Why did she say that? (laughs) I know!

00:28:44.576 --> 00:28:45.928
ORION: Who was that person?

00:28:45.928 --> 00:28:47.887
MARISHA: That was so weird, right?

00:28:47.887 --> 00:28:52.502
ORION: Everywhere we go. It's everywhere we go.
Why can't people be normal?

00:28:52.502 --> 00:28:54.926
TRAVIS: She's warming up to me, I can feel it.

00:28:54.926 --> 00:29:02.680
MATT: As the ship slowly begins to descend, you
can see, in the distance, from one of the various

00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:07.487
mountain ranges that break past the top, there is
one singular mountain spire that tends to protrude

00:29:07.538 --> 00:29:14.284
from the center of the forest, about 20 to 30
miles off the shoreline of the Ozmit Sea. Around

00:29:14.284 --> 00:29:20.052
the base of this mountain, you can see, the closer
you get to it, what looks like hundreds upon

00:29:20.052 --> 00:29:25.735
hundreds of stone buildings. You can see little
details along the mountainside. Countless

00:29:25.735 --> 00:29:31.621
staircases are spiraling up this mountain in
different directions in a chaotic fashion. There

00:29:31.621 --> 00:29:36.845
are large structures, fortresses, built into the
side of this mountain spire as you progress up the

00:29:36.845 --> 00:29:46.841
top. And this city proper, which spreads out, I'd
say, about a third larger than Emon. Layers of

00:29:46.841 --> 00:29:51.463
walls and walls and walls. This is
probably the most-fortified city you've seen in

00:29:51.572 --> 00:29:57.946
your existence up to this point. Slowly it begins
to bring itself down towards-- and you can see, as

00:29:57.946 --> 00:30:06.310
you get closer to the city, the walls vary in
color and material. Some look recently built. Some

00:30:06.310 --> 00:30:12.445
look like they'd been constructed in the past 50
to 60 years or so from fine, smooth stone, using

00:30:12.593 --> 00:30:18.594
modern architectural techniques. Some walls look
extremely ancient, partially crumbled and having

00:30:18.594 --> 00:30:28.731
to be refortified. You also notice the top of
these walls are completely covered with what looks

00:30:28.731 --> 00:30:35.020
like these strange dragon-headed ballistae. These
defense ballistae that are along every single row

00:30:35.020 --> 00:30:39.065
of walls. This is a city that is meant to
withstand--

00:30:39.065 --> 00:30:40.433
MARISHA: A siege.

00:30:40.433 --> 00:30:42.133
MATT: -- any sort of a siege or onslaught.

00:30:42.133 --> 00:30:45.824
LAURA: Does it look like it's suffered a lot of
sieges? I mean, is there battle damage to the--

00:30:45.824 --> 00:30:49.745
MATT: It's hard to tell from this distance. You're
just starting to pick up details as the ship

00:30:49.745 --> 00:30:54.241
slowly descends into the city of Vasselheim
proper. But from what you can tell, there are

00:30:54.241 --> 00:30:59.831
scars across some of the larger buildings. Some of
the walls look like they have sections that have

00:30:59.831 --> 00:31:04.742
been knocked down and then rebuilt and then
knocked down and then rebuilt. This is a very,

00:31:04.742 --> 00:31:14.205
very old, old city. Slowly, the ship descends
towards what looks like a smoothed-out, flattened

00:31:14.205 --> 00:31:19.875
platform on top of some mill of some kind. It
doesn't look like it's built for skyship purposes,

00:31:19.875 --> 00:31:25.093
more than it's been haphazardly put together to
receive a skyship should it come to the city. But

00:31:25.093 --> 00:31:30.198
it looks like that type of travel doesn't come to
this area too often. At this point in time, you

00:31:30.258 --> 00:31:33.792
can see now, the crew is gathering their ropes,
they're getting ready to go ahead and lower it

00:31:33.792 --> 00:31:38.818
down. Captain Damon is slowly steering and
shouting directions back and forth to his

00:31:38.818 --> 00:31:50.046
deckhands. The Scalebearers and Kima come up to
the top of the ship, carrying the box that

00:31:50.046 --> 00:31:55.348
contains the Horn of Orcus, as well. As the ship
slowly makes its way to dock on the top of this

00:31:55.348 --> 00:32:02.129
mill, Kima, who has all of her materials over her
shoulder, says, "All right, so. It's everyone's

00:32:02.129 --> 00:32:03.973
"first time here in the city?"

00:32:03.973 --> 00:32:05.018
SAM: Yes.

00:32:05.018 --> 00:32:05.980
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:32:05.980 --> 00:32:07.307
SAM: Yeah, well. Keyleth?

00:32:07.307 --> 00:32:08.606
ORION: I've never been here.

00:32:08.606 --> 00:32:09.386
MARISHA: No.

00:32:09.386 --> 00:32:10.217
SAM: Okay. Yes.

00:32:10.217 --> 00:32:11.020
MATT: "All right."

00:32:11.020 --> 00:32:15.241
ORION: And there's enough in the interim for a
short rest from us getting from there to the last

00:32:15.438 --> 00:32:16.667
day to where we're at?

00:32:16.667 --> 00:32:17.546
MATT: Yeah, yeah.

00:32:17.546 --> 00:32:18.522
TRAVIS: A day's rest? All right.

00:32:18.522 --> 00:32:19.543
ORION: Okay, cool. Awesome.

00:32:19.543 --> 00:32:20.174
MATT: Yeah.

00:32:20.174 --> 00:32:21.267
TRAVIS: Tiberius, you ever been here?

00:32:21.267 --> 00:32:22.031
ORION: No.

00:32:22.031 --> 00:32:23.013
(laughter)

00:32:23.013 --> 00:32:26.191
LAURA: Is it cold in the city?

00:32:26.191 --> 00:32:32.601
MATT: It's pretty chilly as you come down. I mean,
you wear furs naturally in cold environments, but

00:32:32.601 --> 00:32:36.936
this is-- the temperature's to the point where you
may have to consider getting a little bit of

00:32:36.936 --> 00:32:39.043
warmer clothing if you travel too far outside of
the city.

00:32:39.043 --> 00:32:41.082
TRAVIS: How do goliaths do? Not wearing much.

00:32:41.082 --> 00:32:42.739
LAURA: I have a lot of winter cloaks already in
my--

00:32:42.739 --> 00:32:44.232
SAM: We have some fancy cloaks, too, don't we?

00:32:44.232 --> 00:32:45.980
LAURA: Well, those are fancy clothes.

00:32:45.980 --> 00:32:46.806
SAM: Oh.

00:32:46.806 --> 00:32:49.563
LAURA: But I've got winter coats that I bought for
the group a long time ago.

00:32:49.563 --> 00:32:51.742
SAM: All right. Pass them out.

00:32:51.742 --> 00:32:52.922
LAURA: All right.

00:32:52.922 --> 00:32:55.372
MATT: So she pulls out the really nice, thick--

00:32:55.372 --> 00:32:57.154
MARISHA: Oh, that's right. We went shopping.

00:32:57.154 --> 00:32:58.041
LAURA: Remember?

00:32:58.041 --> 00:32:58.983
MARISHA: I remember.

00:32:58.983 --> 00:32:59.962
ASHLEY: Oh, we went shopping.

00:32:59.962 --> 00:33:01.068
TRAVIS: We have three other fancy robes.

00:33:01.068 --> 00:33:01.908
ASHLEY: We had a girl shop day.

00:33:01.908 --> 00:33:02.689
MARISHA: Yep.

00:33:02.689 --> 00:33:03.940
SAM: A fancy. I want a fancy robe.

00:33:03.940 --> 00:33:06.210
TRAVIS: You do? It's huge on you. You want it
anyway.

00:33:06.210 --> 00:33:07.605
ORION: I'd have to take off my cloak, though, to
wear that, right?

00:33:07.605 --> 00:33:08.334
MATT: Yeah.

00:33:08.334 --> 00:33:09.435
ORION: I won't wear one. I keep my cloak on.

00:33:09.435 --> 00:33:10.407
TRAVIS: I give you a colorful one.

00:33:10.407 --> 00:33:11.195
SAM: I'll gird it.

00:33:11.195 --> 00:33:13.061
MATT: We'll say you could probably put it over. It
will just look a little chunky.

00:33:13.061 --> 00:33:13.951
ORION: Okay.

00:33:13.951 --> 00:33:19.706
SAM: I'm going to take a large fancy robe and try
to tie it up-- to gird it so that it looks okay.

00:33:19.706 --> 00:33:21.281
LAURA: He wants a fancy robe, not a fur.

00:33:21.281 --> 00:33:22.560
TRAVIS: Be aware, we only have two left.

00:33:22.560 --> 00:33:23.738
SAM: I'm going to gird my loins.

00:33:23.738 --> 00:33:27.244
MATT: And you gird them well. You look like the
tiniest Turkish wrestler you've ever seen.

00:33:27.244 --> 00:33:28.030
LAURA: Oh.

00:33:28.030 --> 00:33:29.300
(laughter)

00:33:29.300 --> 00:33:30.452
MATT: It's kind of adorable.

00:33:30.452 --> 00:33:33.313
SAM: Also, I'm going to cast Lightning Bolt into
the Ioun Stone.

00:33:33.313 --> 00:33:34.452
ORION: Yay.

00:33:34.452 --> 00:33:38.042
MATT: Okay. So mark that down, you have a
third-level Lightning Bolt saved. You still used

00:33:38.042 --> 00:33:42.940
the spell slot, but after you rest, it'll be safe
inside there. Which is an interesting experience,

00:33:42.940 --> 00:33:49.169
you see him do this arcane finger wiggle in the
air, and then he releases what is a burst of

00:33:49.169 --> 00:33:53.160
electrical energy that immediately funnels itself
and vanishes into the stone, which is now humming

00:33:53.160 --> 00:33:55.982
with this low pulsing glow of greenish-blue
light.

00:33:55.982 --> 00:33:57.743
SAM: (whispers) Pike, are you watching this?

00:33:57.743 --> 00:33:59.406
ASHLEY: Wow, and you're--

00:33:59.406 --> 00:34:01.619
LAURA: It's green? It's a green-- wait, is it like
a diamond shape?

00:34:01.619 --> 00:34:02.761
SAM: I don't know.

00:34:02.761 --> 00:34:04.701
LAURA: It's like a Sim!

00:34:04.701 --> 00:34:06.157
MARISHA: Oh, it's like a Sims thing.

00:34:06.157 --> 00:34:07.094
ORION: It's like a little--

00:34:07.094 --> 00:34:08.583
LAURA: As long as it's green, you're happy,
Scanlan!

00:34:08.583 --> 00:34:11.201
ORION: But I believe it's white, right? It's a
white stone?

00:34:11.201 --> 00:34:14.458
MATT: It is a white stone, but the energy glowing
off it is greenish in color.

00:34:14.458 --> 00:34:15.465
ORION: Ah, there you go.

00:34:15.465 --> 00:34:16.303
MARISHA: He's happy.

00:34:16.303 --> 00:34:17.528
ASHLEY: And you're so well-girded.

00:34:17.528 --> 00:34:19.376
SAM: I'm girded and I've got a shiny head.

00:34:19.376 --> 00:34:24.741
MATT: Eventually the ship comes to a stop. You
feel a little bit of a lurching sensation as the

00:34:24.741 --> 00:34:31.872
ship suddenly halts its advancing. All the ropes
get dropped off the sides. They start bringing

00:34:31.872 --> 00:34:37.602
what looks to be some sort of a haphazard crane
also, in preparation for Trinket to be lowered off

00:34:37.602 --> 00:34:48.969
the ship. You can see, there's a look of-- I can't
describe it better than anxiousness to Kima. She

00:34:48.969 --> 00:34:52.545
says, "If you have any questions about the city,
just speak up and I'll do my best."

00:34:52.545 --> 00:34:54.294
LAURA: Where do we take the Horn?

00:34:54.294 --> 00:34:55.442
SAM: (laughs) That's a good question.

00:34:55.442 --> 00:34:56.599
(laughter)

00:34:56.599 --> 00:34:59.509
MATT: "I believe--" And she looks over the edge of
the ship. "I believe our escorts will be happy to

00:34:59.509 --> 00:35:00.794
"guide us."

00:35:00.794 --> 00:35:01.633
LAURA: Our escorts?

00:35:01.633 --> 00:35:03.824
LIAM: I'd like to do an insight check before we
hustle off.

00:35:03.824 --> 00:35:05.020
MATT: On?

00:35:05.020 --> 00:35:05.765
TRAVIS: Kima.

00:35:05.765 --> 00:35:06.539
LIAM: Kima.

00:35:06.539 --> 00:35:07.585
MATT: Go for it.

00:35:07.585 --> 00:35:10.630
ORION: I would like to look for any places-- oh,
sorry.

00:35:10.630 --> 00:35:12.693
LIAM: I rolled an 18.

00:35:12.693 --> 00:35:14.523
MATT: Okay, and what are you trying to glean off
of her?

00:35:14.523 --> 00:35:23.165
LIAM: Why does she seem anxious? Does she seem
different? Does her demeanor seem different, or

00:35:23.165 --> 00:35:25.243
does she just seem in a hurry?

00:35:25.243 --> 00:35:29.522
MATT: You can probably take it as a little bit of
being in a hurry, but you also get the feeling

00:35:29.522 --> 00:35:42.251
like-- there's a nervousness to her that stems--
it's hard to really tell where it comes from, but

00:35:42.251 --> 00:35:44.317
there is a nervousness to her.

00:35:44.317 --> 00:35:47.349
LAURA: Kima, when was the last time you were with
your Order?

00:35:47.349 --> 00:35:49.689
MATT: "Proper? That would be eight years."

00:35:49.689 --> 00:35:50.694
LAURA: Oh.

00:35:50.694 --> 00:35:55.343
ORION: That's a long time to be out of Order.

00:35:55.343 --> 00:35:56.890
MATT: "Of which-- we are about to meet them."

00:35:56.890 --> 00:35:57.700
ORION: Sorry.

00:35:57.700 --> 00:35:58.927
SAM: High five.

00:35:58.927 --> 00:36:00.319
LAURA: Do you get along well with them?

00:36:00.319 --> 00:36:04.662
MATT: "Yes. Yes. They're just, well." (laughs)
"You'll see." And she leaps over the side of the

00:36:04.662 --> 00:36:09.333
ship, grabbing the rope, and lowers herself down,
as do the rest of the-- the two Scalebearers come

00:36:09.333 --> 00:36:14.751
down in tandem, clutching the chain on the sides
of the box, bringing it down almost like a big

00:36:14.751 --> 00:36:15.922
Jacob's ladder.

00:36:15.922 --> 00:36:17.558
TRAVIS: (quietly) I love you.

00:36:17.558 --> 00:36:20.364
MATT: Eventually, you all make your way onto the
platform, and they're waiting for you. You see

00:36:20.364 --> 00:36:27.596
there's a cluster of well-armored men and women,
wearing semi-matching gray tabards over patchwork

00:36:27.596 --> 00:36:36.316
and plated armor. They look like a really
rough-and-tumble militia, but they all stand firm

00:36:36.316 --> 00:36:41.640
and as you guys walk up, they give a nod of
respect and understanding. Amongst them, you see

00:36:41.640 --> 00:36:47.356
one gentleman, an elderly gentleman with no hair,
completely bald, thick spectacles on the tip of

00:36:47.356 --> 00:36:51.855
his nose, wearing the same silver and blue robes
as the envoys that met you at the Council of

00:36:51.855 --> 00:36:57.731
Tal'Dorei, the ones that are carrying the box. As
you all approach, Kima steps out ahead and says,

00:36:57.731 --> 00:37:00.629
"Yonn. It's been a while."

00:37:00.629 --> 00:37:02.051
SAM: Yonn.

00:37:02.051 --> 00:37:07.524
MATT: The old man steps forward. "It has been,
indeed, Kima. It has, indeed. And that's

00:37:07.524 --> 00:37:10.343
"Scalebearer Yonn, if you don't mind--"

00:37:10.500 --> 00:37:12.014
TRAVIS: Scalebearer.

00:37:12.014 --> 00:37:16.994
MATT: "I would prefer in mixed company the proper
niceties of our presentation."

00:37:16.994 --> 00:37:19.033
LAURA: Oh, we're no proper company. It's all
right.

00:37:19.033 --> 00:37:20.667
MATT: "Hm. And you are?"

00:37:20.667 --> 00:37:23.501
SAM: We are--

00:37:23.501 --> 00:37:28.814
ORION: I'm Tiberius Stormwind, and we are Vox
Machina. Everybody has names, too.

00:37:28.814 --> 00:37:29.857
LAURA: Hmm.

00:37:29.857 --> 00:37:30.736
ASHLEY: I'm Pike.

00:37:30.736 --> 00:37:33.097
MARISHA: Keyleth.

00:37:33.097 --> 00:37:36.862
SAM: I'm Ioun Stone-bearer Scanlan.

00:37:36.862 --> 00:37:39.161
(laughter)

00:37:39.161 --> 00:37:40.476
MATT: He cocks his head curiously.

00:37:40.476 --> 00:37:42.432
SAM: You can call me Kingslayer.

00:37:42.432 --> 00:37:44.087
I also did that.

00:37:44.087 --> 00:37:48.527
MATT: "Very well." Percy introduces himself, as
well.

00:37:48.527 --> 00:37:50.279
TRAVIS: I have a beard.

00:37:50.279 --> 00:37:52.027
(laughter)

00:37:52.027 --> 00:37:56.378
MATT: He gives you the most curious look of all,
which is hard to follow off of Scanlan over here.

00:37:56.378 --> 00:38:03.960
"And I'm to understand these are the bearers of
the artifact?" Kima gives a nod. "Yes, and I think

00:38:04.019 --> 00:38:08.933
"we should be on our way quickly." "Yes, yes, of
course. Please. These are our escorts. Follow

00:38:08.933 --> 00:38:15.596
"suit. We will bring you onward to the Platinum
Sanctuary proper to dispose of this thing."

00:38:15.596 --> 00:38:19.270
SAM: How far is the Platinum Sanctuary?

00:38:19.270 --> 00:38:21.854
MATT: "No more than a 25-minute walk."

00:38:21.854 --> 00:38:22.724
LAURA and SAM: Oh.

00:38:22.724 --> 00:38:24.230
ASHLEY: May I insight-check Yonn?

00:38:24.230 --> 00:38:25.159
MATT: You may.

00:38:25.159 --> 00:38:26.109
LIAM: Yes, please.

00:38:26.109 --> 00:38:27.034
MARISHA: Oh, so--

00:38:27.034 --> 00:38:30.816
ORION: I'm going to look for any temples that
might have a sigil inside while we're going

00:38:30.816 --> 00:38:31.766
through the town.

00:38:31.766 --> 00:38:35.837
MATT: All right. Do you want to ask around about
that?

00:38:35.837 --> 00:38:39.371
ORION: I'll ask the Yonn guy.

00:38:39.371 --> 00:38:42.128
MATT: Okay. Well, first off, you finish your
insight check. What did you roll?

00:38:42.128 --> 00:38:43.362
ASHLEY: What did you get, Liam?

00:38:43.362 --> 00:38:44.409
LIAM: 13.

00:38:44.409 --> 00:38:46.514
ASHLEY: Okay. I got 15.

00:38:46.514 --> 00:38:52.604
MATT: Okay. He seems stuffy. He seems definitely
dedicated to whatever his intent is, but there

00:38:52.604 --> 00:38:57.585
doesn't seem to be anything deceptive in his
speech.

00:38:57.585 --> 00:39:02.824
MARISHA: So am I correct to assume our plan is
that we're going to march this Horn through the

00:39:02.824 --> 00:39:05.265
town? Until we get to the temple?

00:39:05.265 --> 00:39:06.616
LAURA: Well, nobody knows what it is.

00:39:06.616 --> 00:39:07.504
ORION: Right.

00:39:07.504 --> 00:39:08.383
SAM: Well, unless someone--

00:39:08.383 --> 00:39:09.863
LAURA: So we'll just be aware there's a huge
envoy.

00:39:09.863 --> 00:39:12.268
MARISHA: I mean, we can only assume-- Yonn?

00:39:12.268 --> 00:39:13.416
MATT: "Yes?"

00:39:13.416 --> 00:39:17.073
MARISHA: How many people in this city are aware of
this Horn being brought here?

00:39:17.073 --> 00:39:30.536
MATT: "Well, up until now, other than myself, you
travelers, and the Highbearer Vord himself, no one else."

00:39:30.536 --> 00:39:31.501
ORION: Hm.

00:39:31.501 --> 00:39:32.732
MARISHA: Highbearer Vor-- his name is Vord?

00:39:32.732 --> 00:39:34.274
MATT: "Vord. The Highbearer of the Platinum
Dragon."

00:39:34.274 --> 00:39:35.641
LAURA: What kind of man is he?

00:39:35.641 --> 00:39:39.843
MATT: You hear when he mentions Vord, Kima
twitches a little bit, and you remember Kima's

00:39:39.843 --> 00:39:42.489
official title is Lady Kima of Vord.

00:39:42.489 --> 00:39:43.415
LAURA AND ORION: Hm.

00:39:43.415 --> 00:39:45.098
SAM: Her ex?

00:39:45.098 --> 00:39:46.419
TRAVIS: Is that her pops? Her pops?

00:39:46.419 --> 00:39:47.711
ORION: Vonn. Yonn?

00:39:47.711 --> 00:39:50.601
MATT: "Scalebearer Yonn, yes."

00:39:50.601 --> 00:39:56.082
ORION: Oh, Scalebearer Yonn, that's a fun name.
(clears throat) As we travel through town, if you

00:39:56.082 --> 00:40:02.255
could point me to any place that would have a
sigil of arcane-ness--

00:40:02.255 --> 00:40:05.330
SAM: Arcane-iosity is what he's trying to say.

00:40:05.330 --> 00:40:06.479
MATT: "There are none."

00:40:06.479 --> 00:40:07.235
ORION: Oh.

00:40:07.235 --> 00:40:13.080
MATT: "This city, arcane magic for the most part,
is not allowed within consistent practice. This is

00:40:13.129 --> 00:40:14.927
"a divine, a holy place."

00:40:14.927 --> 00:40:15.767
ORION: Ah.

00:40:15.767 --> 00:40:20.960
MATT: "And the arcane tends to, ah. How do you
say, when unwatched, corrupt and destroy from the

00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:22.312
"inside. "

00:40:22.312 --> 00:40:25.183
LIAM: Oh shit, Tiberius.

00:40:25.183 --> 00:40:28.421
ORION: No, I'm fine! He's talking about other
people.

00:40:28.421 --> 00:40:32.287
TRAVIS: You don't have any arcane abilities
anyway, right?

00:40:32.287 --> 00:40:34.188
ORION: Oh of course I do, I'm a sorcerer.

00:40:34.188 --> 00:40:35.570
LAURA: No no no, right?

00:40:35.570 --> 00:40:36.608
SAM: Ix-nay.

00:40:36.608 --> 00:40:37.636
TRAVIS: Wink wink, nudge nudge.

00:40:37.636 --> 00:40:38.930
ORION: No, no, I think he-- sure.

00:40:38.930 --> 00:40:44.596
MATT: "This here in Vasselheim, the cradle of
faith, the Dawn City, of once all civilization and

00:40:44.596 --> 00:40:52.291
"current faith once stemmed from. There is no way
in but by foot. It is a pilgrimage, a journey for

00:40:52.291 --> 00:40:57.287
"each to come here, and those that stay, stay of
their own will and divine right." And as he refers

00:40:57.287 --> 00:41:02.624
to the guards, each guard you see now has around
their neck a very visibly shown holy symbol of

00:41:02.624 --> 00:41:06.672
some kind of deity. Most seem to fall--

00:41:06.672 --> 00:41:08.586
MARISHA: We've basically walked into the
Crucible.

00:41:08.586 --> 00:41:09.663
ORION: It's fine.

00:41:09.663 --> 00:41:15.394
MATT: -- into the realm of Arathis, Avandra,
Melora, and a couple with Bahamut. None of--

00:41:15.394 --> 00:41:16.650
ASHLEY: None of Sarenrae.

00:41:16.650 --> 00:41:17.790
MATT: None of Sarenrae.

00:41:17.790 --> 00:41:18.882
TRAVIS: Or as Liam calls it, Sa-REN-rae.

00:41:18.882 --> 00:41:19.921
LAURA: The best one?

00:41:19.921 --> 00:41:20.851
ASHLEY: The best, the best one.

00:41:20.851 --> 00:41:21.926
LIAM: Sa-REN-rae!

00:41:21.926 --> 00:41:22.937
(laughter)

00:41:22.937 --> 00:41:23.851
ASHLEY: Sarenrae!

00:41:23.851 --> 00:41:26.470
ORION: I'm going to take it you don't see very
many dragonborn in these parts.

00:41:26.470 --> 00:41:28.341
MATT: "No, and frankly you're making me a bit
nervous."

00:41:28.341 --> 00:41:29.187
ORION: Oh.

00:41:29.187 --> 00:41:34.994
MATT: "However, as we ourselves are followers of
the Platinum Dragon, we understand that it is

00:41:34.994 --> 00:41:42.165
"dragonkind at the heart of it, the metallics, that
bring life and civilization and order to this

00:41:42.165 --> 00:41:43.150
"world."

00:41:43.150 --> 00:41:44.348
ORION: Yes.

00:41:44.348 --> 00:41:46.507
MATT: "Your color I find off-putting."

00:41:46.507 --> 00:41:47.381
ORION: It's--

00:41:47.381 --> 00:41:50.069
LAURA: I've always noticed a fine metallic sheen
coming from your red scales.

00:41:50.069 --> 00:41:55.296
ORION: No, I'm of the chromatic nature, I'm a bit
of an anomaly in my family, they're all of the

00:41:55.344 --> 00:42:01.423
metallic brand, I assure you. The Stormwind name
runs true and wide throughout Draconia, but--

00:42:01.423 --> 00:42:03.772
MATT: "I have heard of the Stormwinds, yes."

00:42:03.772 --> 00:42:09.205
ORION: I cast Alter Self real quick and I turn
myself into, I believe, gold. Because that's the

00:42:09.205 --> 00:42:12.315
red-- equivalent of red. On the metallic scale.

00:42:12.361 --> 00:42:14.014
MATT: Okay. He gives you a curious look and
goes--

00:42:14.014 --> 00:42:16.751
ORION: I think that would be better for everyone
involved.

00:42:16.751 --> 00:42:22.684
MATT: "I would be mindful to not do such things so
openly in public in the future."

00:42:22.684 --> 00:42:23.769
ORION: Oh, sorry.

00:42:23.769 --> 00:42:31.890
MATT: "Ahem." And he kind of adjusts his robe.
"This way please, follow me." And Scalebearer Yonn

00:42:31.890 --> 00:42:33.689
leads you--

00:42:33.689 --> 00:42:34.843
LAURA: You look very nice, Tiberius.

00:42:34.843 --> 00:42:35.858
ASHLEY: You look really great in gold.

00:42:35.858 --> 00:42:37.019
ORION: Thank you, thank you.

00:42:37.019 --> 00:42:38.106
MARISHA: So wait, hang on, hang on, hang on.

00:42:38.106 --> 00:42:38.776
TRAVIS: What?

00:42:38.776 --> 00:42:39.925
MARISHA: Before we move on-- we're about to leave,
I'm assuming?

00:42:39.925 --> 00:42:43.724
MATT: You're stepping off the platform onto a
staircase that leads off of the top of the mill.

00:42:43.724 --> 00:42:48.774
MARISHA: Should a few of us kind of like flank
around and--

00:42:48.774 --> 00:42:51.195
LAURA: Definitely, we should all kind of surround
the box, sure.

00:42:51.195 --> 00:42:52.493
TRAVIS: Like rooftops and shit.

00:42:52.493 --> 00:42:53.459
MARISHA: Rooftop shit, yeah.

00:42:53.459 --> 00:42:54.230
LAURA: Oh.

00:42:54.230 --> 00:42:55.081
TRAVIS: I like it.

00:42:55.081 --> 00:42:56.413
MARISHA: I can go eagle form and have aerial
support.

00:42:56.413 --> 00:42:57.475
TRAVIS: I love it.

00:42:57.475 --> 00:43:00.317
LAURA: I can stick to the rooftops, I guess, try
to follow along.

00:43:00.317 --> 00:43:01.356
TRAVIS: Overwatch.

00:43:01.356 --> 00:43:02.625
MARISHA: Overwatch. What's that? Yeah.

00:43:02.625 --> 00:43:04.174
LAURA: I'll snick to the rooftops and try to
follow along, sniper eye.

00:43:04.174 --> 00:43:05.116
MARISHA: Okay.

00:43:05.116 --> 00:43:06.122
TRAVIS: Yeah, you two up top.

00:43:06.122 --> 00:43:07.667
ASHLEY: I'll just stay right on the path.

00:43:07.667 --> 00:43:08.630
TRAVIS: Yep, you and me.

00:43:08.630 --> 00:43:09.742
MATT: All right.

00:43:09.742 --> 00:43:10.983
TRAVIS: Smash hands.

00:43:10.983 --> 00:43:12.166
MATT: All right, so.

00:43:12.166 --> 00:43:13.389
ORION: I'll take the six.

00:43:13.389 --> 00:43:14.632
MATT: Okay. As you--

00:43:14.632 --> 00:43:17.961
LIAM: I'm gonna stay with it but try to blend in
with the crowd.

00:43:17.961 --> 00:43:20.574
MATT: All right, all right. Go ahead and make a
stealth check.

00:43:20.574 --> 00:43:21.839
LIAM: Yes.

00:43:21.839 --> 00:43:23.135
TRAVIS: Scanlan?

00:43:23.135 --> 00:43:26.257
LIAM: 23 for stealth.

00:43:26.257 --> 00:43:29.258
MATT: All right, ah, if you wouldn't mind, Vex,
making a stealth check as well?

00:43:29.258 --> 00:43:30.135
LAURA: Oh.

00:43:30.135 --> 00:43:31.141
TRAVIS: Overwatch.

00:43:31.141 --> 00:43:33.329
MATT: Just to keep your rooftop activity
inconspicuous.

00:43:33.329 --> 00:43:34.513
LAURA: Not disturbing.

00:43:34.513 --> 00:43:35.391
TRAVIS: We have a UAV.

00:43:35.391 --> 00:43:37.076
LAURA: Oh, well I rolled a one. So that's lovely.

00:43:37.076 --> 00:43:38.101
MATT: Okay.

00:43:38.101 --> 00:43:39.303
SAM: Are you flying up above?

00:43:39.303 --> 00:43:40.473
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm going eagle.

00:43:40.473 --> 00:43:42.107
TRAVIS: Don't you have advantage?

00:43:42.107 --> 00:43:45.755
LAURA: Do I have advantage in-- no.

00:43:45.755 --> 00:43:48.173
ORION: And I'm taking up the rear, following
behind.

00:43:48.173 --> 00:43:49.596
MATT: No. Not in this terrain, unfortunately.

00:43:49.596 --> 00:43:50.577
ASHLEY: But there are forests here.

00:43:50.577 --> 00:43:51.924
LAURA: But with the forests I'd be amazing.

00:43:51.924 --> 00:43:53.976
LIAM: I do applaud your honesty, though, sister.

00:43:53.976 --> 00:43:54.821
LAURA: Yeah.

00:43:54.821 --> 00:43:59.391
MATT: So as you loudly clomp up and begin
rooftop-hopping, a few individuals in the city

00:43:59.391 --> 00:44:01.433
kind of take notice and they point up, which by
the way--

00:44:01.433 --> 00:44:03.710
LAURA: I wink at them as I'm climbing up.

00:44:03.710 --> 00:44:09.996
MATT: Ah, the classic Vex wink. All right, so.
Just you guys-- kind of atmosphere, as you step down

00:44:09.996 --> 00:44:13.976
the staircase and get to the main city street
proper, the first thing you notice, the roads

00:44:13.976 --> 00:44:22.243
themselves are not cobblestone, are not brick,
they are mud. They are thick, recently sleeted

00:44:22.300 --> 00:44:29.380
mud. You hear the clomping of horse hooves as
carts are pulled through and each one is a sickly

00:44:29.380 --> 00:44:34.629
(squelch) sound as each footstep makes it through.
The people of this city are a very hardened and

00:44:34.629 --> 00:44:42.448
rugged folk. Most clothing is swathed in furs and
thick leathers, armor is patchwork in itself, most

00:44:42.448 --> 00:44:45.736
of the men grow coarse facial hair and the women
themselves, their hair is wild and their

00:44:45.736 --> 00:44:53.525
appearance very stoic and grizzled. The landscape
of Vasselheim-- oh, thank you kindly. Delivery of

00:44:53.525 --> 00:44:54.590
our chicken.

00:44:54.590 --> 00:44:55.940
MARISHA: Chicken through the magic door.

00:44:55.940 --> 00:45:01.864
MATT: The people who live here, you gather,
quickly walking through-- and Kima gives you a bit

00:45:01.864 --> 00:45:10.474
of insight as well-- live here not because it's
easy to live, not because there's many comforts,

00:45:10.532 --> 00:45:15.119
it's a very harsh living in the city of
Vasselheim. But the city is also currently the

00:45:15.119 --> 00:45:20.875
oldest known bastion of civilization in the world.
As far as it's understood, most human

00:45:20.875 --> 00:45:26.863
civilization, and a lot of humans believe pre-elf
and pre-dwarf, although the dwarves and elves very

00:45:26.863 --> 00:45:32.283
staunchly disagree, all stemmed from this city,
which is believed to be tens of thousands of years

00:45:32.283 --> 00:45:39.848
old. They have uncovered the single oldest temples
to the main deities of good and neutrality within

00:45:39.848 --> 00:45:44.875
this city, and as such it is considered the
holiest place in the modern world, which is why it

00:45:44.875 --> 00:45:51.422
has been through many, many wars and has seen much
warfare and strife and difficulty. And those that

00:45:51.422 --> 00:45:56.120
live here live here because they feel that they
can fight against this, and they actually call it

00:45:56.120 --> 00:46:01.864
a privilege to exist in this harsh landscape as
devotion to their respective deities. Also,

00:46:01.864 --> 00:46:06.531
because it is such a holy place, this is why the
arcane is considered, for the most part, profane

00:46:06.531 --> 00:46:09.815
in public and very carefully controlled otherwise.

00:46:09.815 --> 00:46:12.872
TRAVIS: So we gotta be sneaky with that.

00:46:12.872 --> 00:46:14.036
LAURA: Yeah.

00:46:14.036 --> 00:46:15.809
MATT: The buildings look old--

00:46:15.809 --> 00:46:17.843
TRAVIS: So I'll put my spells in my back pocket
for now.

00:46:17.843 --> 00:46:22.825
MATT: The buildings range from old to newer stone,
warped wood from just the weather itself. You can

00:46:22.825 --> 00:46:28.167
see a lot of the wood has a kind of mossy texture
to it just from the general overgrowth that tends

00:46:28.167 --> 00:46:36.320
to take the city. It's not kept for beauty, it's
kept for function. There's scars across most of

00:46:36.320 --> 00:46:42.264
the buildings where you can see warfare has bled
into the city, and there are markings and various

00:46:42.264 --> 00:46:46.429
points of ancient damage and certain structures
that have not been rebuilt, that have just been

00:46:46.429 --> 00:46:50.185
left in ruin where they stand, because they have
not yet found somebody or a purpose to be

00:46:50.185 --> 00:46:57.678
restructured. It's a very different landscape than
what you're used to, and the walk itself is a very

00:46:57.678 --> 00:47:01.429
solemn, quiet walk through the city. The folks
that do take notice just kind of give a nod of

00:47:01.429 --> 00:47:07.855
acknowledgement or a gruff grunt as they pass by.
There doesn't seem to be a definite interest in

00:47:07.855 --> 00:47:12.412
your travel, this isn't a special occasion. It
seems like travelers and strange occurrences are

00:47:12.412 --> 00:47:15.908
not that unnatural in this city.

00:47:15.908 --> 00:47:18.583
MARISHA: Okay. So it's like New York.

00:47:18.583 --> 00:47:22.386
MATT: You could say that, yeah. It's a very
ancient New York.

00:47:22.386 --> 00:47:25.916
SAM: And we're carrying a large ark, or a box of
some sort?

00:47:25.916 --> 00:47:30.784
MATT: You are carrying the platinum box that the
Horn was kept in.

00:47:30.784 --> 00:47:32.335
SAM: How big is it?

00:47:32.335 --> 00:47:35.027
MATT: It's approximately like a foot and a half,
or two feet by two feet.

00:47:35.075 --> 00:47:36.372
ASHLEY: Oh, Taliesin's here.

00:47:36.372 --> 00:47:37.376
LAURA: Oh!

00:47:37.376 --> 00:47:38.390
TRAVIS: Taliesin's outside.

00:47:38.390 --> 00:47:40.358
SAM: And it's platinum? It's just a platinum box?

00:47:40.358 --> 00:47:44.478
MATT: Yes, it is made of like solid platinum and
silver with a series of very, very intricate

00:47:44.478 --> 00:47:46.467
scrolling and engravings on it.

00:47:46.467 --> 00:47:47.751
MARISHA: Is it sticking out like a sore thumb?

00:47:47.751 --> 00:47:49.491
LAURA: There were some sapphires in there, too,
some blue sapphires, I remember.

00:47:49.491 --> 00:47:50.516
MATT: Yes, yes.

00:47:50.516 --> 00:47:52.193
MARISHA: Is it sticking out like a sore thumb?

00:47:52.193 --> 00:47:58.108
MATT: Best you can tell, there are people taking
notice of it, but none that like stop and gawk,

00:47:58.108 --> 00:48:00.777
they just kind of, "huh." Keep walking.

00:48:00.777 --> 00:48:02.802
MARISHA: Damn, maybe we should've thrown a blanket
or something over it.

00:48:02.802 --> 00:48:05.916
MATT: You could if you want to, now.

00:48:05.916 --> 00:48:08.803
TRAVIS: Can we, though?

00:48:08.803 --> 00:48:13.362
MARISHA: Burlap sack or something? Anybody?

00:48:13.362 --> 00:48:17.131
MATT: The guards still flanking you guys,
surrounding this ensemble as it presses towards

00:48:17.131 --> 00:48:24.888
the base of the mountain. You make your way
towards the edge of the mountain, or where the

00:48:24.888 --> 00:48:28.649
mountain begins at the bottom of the floor, and
you can see dozens of staircases ascending the

00:48:28.649 --> 00:48:35.694
outskirts of this giant pointed cragless spire
that just sticks up into, actually, the clouds cut

00:48:35.694 --> 00:48:41.484
off the top of it. It's reminiscent of Gatshadow,
the mountain outside of Westruun that you guys

00:48:41.484 --> 00:48:42.693
traveled to long ago.

00:48:42.693 --> 00:48:43.672
TRAVIS: Right.

00:48:43.672 --> 00:48:49.253
MATT: But even larger. You continue up this
staircase, and the stonework itself is a little

00:48:49.253 --> 00:48:53.205
lopsided and awkward, and with each step sometimes
you have to kinda catch yourself, especially as

00:48:53.205 --> 00:48:56.148
the wind begins to pick up the higher up the
mountain you go, and it takes about 15 to 20

00:48:56.148 --> 00:49:01.540
minutes to ascend this staircase. Your legs begin
to grow a little sore, until eventually you reach

00:49:01.540 --> 00:49:08.724
the base of what you can only imagine is the
Platinum Sanctuary. You see before you, built into

00:49:08.724 --> 00:49:16.043
the side of the rock of this mountain, a grand
stone fortress that looks older than time in

00:49:16.043 --> 00:49:21.261
itself. You can see the elements have weathered to
the point where even the solid points and how the

00:49:21.261 --> 00:49:28.719
stonework was meant to be an edge has been rounded
and smoothed down. There are a series of silver

00:49:28.719 --> 00:49:33.676
markings across the outskirts of it, which
Tiberius, you recognize as Draconic.

00:49:33.676 --> 00:49:36.212
ORION: Look, Percy, it's Draconic.

00:49:36.212 --> 00:49:37.578
TALIESIN: Oh, so it is.

00:49:37.578 --> 00:49:39.976
(laughter)

00:49:39.976 --> 00:49:42.738
MATT: Certain words in Draconic--

00:49:42.738 --> 00:49:44.637
MARISHA: Percy, you've been so quiet here lately.

00:49:44.637 --> 00:49:46.054
TALIESIN: I don't want to talk about it.

00:49:46.054 --> 00:49:54.492
MATT: You see phrases emblazoned on the side of
this giant temple that say things like "honor,

00:49:54.492 --> 00:50:02.687
justice." Various, very old base Draconic stuff.
The current language is a more refined version.

00:50:02.687 --> 00:50:05.470
This is a very, very ancient basis of that language.

00:50:05.634 --> 00:50:10.573
ORION: See that, Scanlan? That says something like
Apollo Justice something.

00:50:10.573 --> 00:50:12.300
SAM: It's Phoenix something.

00:50:12.300 --> 00:50:15.987
ORION: It's maybe the rise of the justice of the
phoenix.

00:50:16.190 --> 00:50:17.873
SAM: Nah, I don't know.

00:50:17.873 --> 00:50:19.258
ORION: It's a lot of things.

00:50:19.258 --> 00:50:20.279
TRAVIS: Dawn of justice--

00:50:20.279 --> 00:50:23.470
MATT: On the top of this fortress, you see three
constructs that don't match the stone structure.

00:50:23.470 --> 00:50:28.003
These may have been constructed or built many
years later and have been added onto the temple.

00:50:28.003 --> 00:50:35.324
But three ivory and silver spires, towers that
ascend from the top of the fortress itself, almost

00:50:35.324 --> 00:50:40.963
parallel to the very steep mountainside that this
fortress is built into. You come to the front

00:50:40.963 --> 00:50:49.991
doors of this structure. Two very, very large gray
stone doors with almost what looks like white

00:50:49.991 --> 00:50:54.864
marbling through them, and you can see, mostly
worn away but still barely visible, the symbol of

00:50:54.924 --> 00:51:00.646
a shield with a dragon head emblazoned on the
front of it, the symbol of Bahamut. As the

00:51:00.646 --> 00:51:06.371
Scalebearer-- yes, that there-- as the
Scalebearers approach the front, the doors, on

00:51:06.371 --> 00:51:11.946
their own, and open to the interior, the grinding
sound of stone across the marble flooring of the

00:51:11.946 --> 00:51:17.005
fortress proper. You can see the interior. Did you
have a question?

00:51:17.005 --> 00:51:20.480
MARISHA: Can I see inside the temple? Or are the
temples pretty enclosed?

00:51:20.480 --> 00:51:21.957
MATT: You can see now as the doors begin to open.

00:51:21.957 --> 00:51:23.329
MARISHA: Well, I was an eagle flying overhead.

00:51:23.329 --> 00:51:24.080
MATT: Oh, yes! You--

00:51:24.080 --> 00:51:27.511
MARISHA: And I was gonna do a perception check to
see if I noticed, like kinda do a loop

00:51:27.511 --> 00:51:28.578
of the temple.

00:51:28.578 --> 00:51:29.701
MATT: Go for it.

00:51:29.701 --> 00:51:30.993
SAM: So, I'm an eagle.

00:51:30.993 --> 00:51:32.988
MARISHA: So I'm an eagle right now, so.

00:51:32.988 --> 00:51:36.124
TALIESIN: You're such an eagle. Oh my god.

00:51:36.124 --> 00:51:39.446
LAURA: I very, very poorly fall off of the roof
and clamber down.

00:51:39.446 --> 00:51:41.300
MARISHA: 20 total.

00:51:41.300 --> 00:51:50.336
MATT: Best you can tell, there are for the
makeshift guards in the city-- which, you've heard

00:51:50.336 --> 00:51:55.889
them referred to as Bastions, they're all
volunteers, and actually from what you gather

00:51:55.889 --> 00:52:01.843
here, probably a quarter of the populace are
Bastions. So they have a very, very heavy

00:52:01.843 --> 00:52:05.993
civilian-based militia that guards this city.

00:52:05.993 --> 00:52:09.140
SAM: Are those the guys who were with us, the 
envoys?

00:52:09.140 --> 00:52:12.040
MATT: Yes. No, no, not the envoys, the envoys'
come from the temple of Bahamut, they have

00:52:12.153 --> 00:52:18.254
the blue and silver robes. You see, they're just
wearing makeshift patchwork armor, whatever that

00:52:18.254 --> 00:52:22.530
could be scavenged or constructed to outfit a
militia, essentially.

00:52:22.530 --> 00:52:23.814
SAM: Okay.

00:52:23.814 --> 00:52:30.547
MATT: You see them going up and down every which
staircase, just doing various passes and

00:52:30.547 --> 00:52:34.055
patrolwork. Some of them have spyglasses and you
see them looking off in the distance, and as

00:52:34.055 --> 00:52:37.800
you're getting higher up the mountain, too, you
look out about, and you can see the entire forest

00:52:37.800 --> 00:52:44.295
around you. Very thick, ominous, and you swear
every now and then you can see some trees move

00:52:44.295 --> 00:52:48.543
suddenly and heavily before coming to rest in the
distance.

00:52:48.543 --> 00:52:50.151
MARISHA: I'm gonna go check that out first.

00:52:50.151 --> 00:52:55.430
MATT: The rest of you are entering the temple.
Keyleth is not there.

00:52:55.430 --> 00:52:56.849
ORION: Is it lit in there?

00:52:56.849 --> 00:52:58.559
MATT: The doors close behind you.

00:52:58.559 --> 00:53:00.330
SAM: Hope Keyleth is okay.

00:53:00.330 --> 00:53:01.611
LAURA: Keyleth--

00:53:01.611 --> 00:53:03.917
MARISHA: (eagle noises)

00:53:03.917 --> 00:53:10.003
LIAM: I don't think that I was with the group, I
think I was back with the crowd--

00:53:10.003 --> 00:53:10.897
LAURA: No, you--

00:53:10.897 --> 00:53:11.858
SAM: Great.

00:53:11.858 --> 00:53:14.382
LIAM: -- so I see the eagle fly off and I'm just
gonna follow after her.

00:53:14.382 --> 00:53:16.094
LAURA: What?

00:53:16.094 --> 00:53:17.662
MATT: The eagle flies out of the city.

00:53:17.662 --> 00:53:18.865
LIAM: Yeah.

00:53:18.865 --> 00:53:20.997
LAURA: You're gonna leave the city, brother?

00:53:20.997 --> 00:53:22.009
LIAM: No.

00:53:22.009 --> 00:53:23.340
ORION: You're leaving?

00:53:23.340 --> 00:53:24.726
MARISHA: Gonna see if I can figure out what's
making the trees move.

00:53:24.726 --> 00:53:26.007
LIAM: Now that I understand the--

00:53:26.007 --> 00:53:27.141
LAURA: Come on in the temple.

00:53:27.141 --> 00:53:28.752
LIAM: But do I still get shut in my face? So.

00:53:28.752 --> 00:53:30.109
MARISHA: I'm flying! I'm fine.

00:53:30.109 --> 00:53:34.157
LIAM: It's a big solid building, doors are shut,
that's it?

00:53:34.157 --> 00:53:37.402
MATT: Yeah, I mean, the temple, would you like to
enter the temple with the rest of the group?

00:53:37.402 --> 00:53:38.715
LAURA: Yeah, you would.

00:53:38.715 --> 00:53:39.720
ASHLEY: Yeah, do it.

00:53:39.720 --> 00:53:41.052
MATT: All right.

00:53:41.052 --> 00:53:42.162
LIAM: Yeah.

00:53:42.162 --> 00:53:46.697
MATT: So just as the doors are closing, you rush
out of your subtle following pattern and, wait,

00:53:46.697 --> 00:53:49.669
and put your hands up and manage to make your way
into the temple right before the doors close,

00:53:49.669 --> 00:53:52.704
catching up with the rest of the group. Keyleth,
make a perception check.

00:53:52.704 --> 00:53:57.002
MARISHA: I have advantage because I'm an eagle.
Ooh, natural 20!

00:53:57.002 --> 00:53:58.390
SAM and TRAVIS: Nice!

00:53:58.390 --> 00:54:00.215
TALIESIN: On the shiny die.

00:54:00.215 --> 00:54:01.453
MATT: All right.

00:54:01.453 --> 00:54:02.928
ORION: It is on the shiny die.

00:54:02.928 --> 00:54:09.106
MATT: It's hard to see much of anything because
the canopy of this forest is so dense and so

00:54:09.106 --> 00:54:14.173
thick, and the snowfall itself, which is getting
stronger through the air, and is kind of obscuring

00:54:14.173 --> 00:54:18.595
some of your vision, but you glance down and you
see another set of trees shift suddenly about a

00:54:18.595 --> 00:54:24.405
quarter-mile away from the city's walls. And you
can see on the edge of the city wall a number of

00:54:24.405 --> 00:54:28.930
guards are beginning to swarm up to the ballista
and starting to load them and prepare them. You

00:54:28.930 --> 00:54:34.846
glance down, and all you see are something
fast-moving beneath the canopy, something large.

00:54:34.846 --> 00:54:44.730
Something you can swear you see it looks
serpentine-like. But multiple serpentine-like

00:54:44.730 --> 00:54:47.227
bodies or forms. And then it's gone in a second.

00:54:47.227 --> 00:54:49.358
LAURA: Hydra! You think it's a hydra?

00:54:49.358 --> 00:54:51.239
ORION: I don't want it to be a hydra.

00:54:51.239 --> 00:54:53.340
LIAM: Stop gasping, I don't see shit, Laura.

00:54:53.340 --> 00:54:54.352
ORION: Oh, that's right.

00:54:54.352 --> 00:54:55.676
LAURA: Shut up!

00:54:55.676 --> 00:55:00.774
MATT: You see a couple ballista set loose. The
bolts go flying through the air, entering the

00:55:00.774 --> 00:55:08.920
forest. You can hear a loud screeching sound, and
a few dozen forests now begin to shake to the side

00:55:09.075 --> 00:55:13.159
as the creature makes its way away from the city
before going still in the distance.

00:55:13.159 --> 00:55:14.272
MARISHA: Okay.

00:55:14.272 --> 00:55:16.589
MATT: You get the sensation that this is a--

00:55:16.589 --> 00:55:17.734
MARISHA: A common occurrence.

00:55:17.734 --> 00:55:19.299
MATT: -- a common occurrence.

00:55:19.299 --> 00:55:22.830
MARISHA: Okay. Good to know. I'm going to loop
back around. Is there like an open window in the

00:55:22.830 --> 00:55:25.569
temple that I can just fly through--

00:55:25.569 --> 00:55:29.102
ORION: Ooh. Is there a super clear one that she
could try to go through first?

00:55:29.102 --> 00:55:32.108
MARISHA: Be like that Windex commercial, back in
the day.

00:55:32.108 --> 00:55:34.120
MATT: The temple--

00:55:34.120 --> 00:55:35.981
ORION: (crashing sounds) Dammit!

00:55:35.981 --> 00:55:37.750
MATT: You make your way--

00:55:37.750 --> 00:55:39.006
MARISHA: I break my neck, I die.

00:55:39.006 --> 00:55:39.983
ORION: No.

00:55:39.983 --> 00:55:42.868
MATT: There are small-- they are not windows, more
than they are slits for arrow defense.

00:55:42.868 --> 00:55:43.735
TRAVIS: Right.

00:55:43.735 --> 00:55:47.166
MATT: You as Keyleth could squeeze through. It
would be one of those things where you have to

00:55:47.166 --> 00:55:50.387
careen in, transform, and then squeeze through.

00:55:50.387 --> 00:55:51.957
MARISHA: Okay, I'll do that.

00:55:51.957 --> 00:55:55.542
MATT: Which you do, and as you do, you come right
into the face of a spear right there--

00:55:55.542 --> 00:55:59.908
LAURA: (gasps) You should have transformed into a
fly.

00:55:59.994 --> 00:56:02.128
MATT: -- as another one of the Platinum Dragon
guards says, "Who goes there?"

00:56:02.128 --> 00:56:03.181
SAM: Oh boy.

00:56:03.181 --> 00:56:06.663
MARISHA: Hi. Hi.

00:56:06.663 --> 00:56:08.370
MATT: Another guard begins to approach from the
side.

00:56:08.370 --> 00:56:15.478
MARISHA: I am with Vox Machina. I'm pretty sure
they just came through the front door. It's cool.

00:56:15.478 --> 00:56:20.512
I was just doing-- just like aerial support. I'm
just going to go and reconnect with my group.

00:56:20.512 --> 00:56:21.904
It's fine.

00:56:21.904 --> 00:56:23.263
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

00:56:23.263 --> 00:56:24.415
MARISHA: I'm Keyleth.

00:56:24.415 --> 00:56:26.102
TRAVIS: (whispers) Mention the Scalebearer.

00:56:26.102 --> 00:56:27.412
MARISHA: I'm not good at this shit.

00:56:27.412 --> 00:56:28.428
MATT: You're not there, Grog.

00:56:28.428 --> 00:56:29.893
MARISHA: What am I doing? A persuasion check?

00:56:29.893 --> 00:56:30.887
MATT: Yeah.

00:56:30.887 --> 00:56:31.915
MARISHA: Christ.

00:56:31.915 --> 00:56:32.821
ORION: You're going to roll a one.

00:56:32.821 --> 00:56:33.807
MATT: Sorry, Miss Charisma.

00:56:33.807 --> 00:56:34.616
MARISHA: Shut up.

00:56:34.616 --> 00:56:35.644
TALIESIN: Oh, wow.

00:56:35.644 --> 00:56:37.397
MARISHA: Oh, wait. I don't know why I'm rolling
two.

00:56:37.397 --> 00:56:38.895
TALIESIN: That's real funny.

00:56:38.895 --> 00:56:40.375
MARISHA: Six?

00:56:40.375 --> 00:56:41.434
LAURA: Oh no!

00:56:41.434 --> 00:56:42.855
SAM: Keyleth's dead.

00:56:42.855 --> 00:56:45.505
ORION: (whispers) No, they'll probably just put
her in prison.

00:56:45.505 --> 00:56:47.774
MATT: The guy holding the spear to you keeps it
there. The other guy walks up behind and says,

00:56:47.774 --> 00:56:51.789
"Let me see your hands."

00:56:51.789 --> 00:56:52.956
LAURA: (gasps)

00:56:52.956 --> 00:56:55.375
LIAM: Shit.

00:56:55.375 --> 00:56:56.634
MARISHA: Why?

00:56:56.634 --> 00:57:04.982
MATT: "Let me see your hands." He takes your
hands, pulls out a set of shackles--

00:57:04.982 --> 00:57:05.906
LAURA: (gasps)

00:57:05.906 --> 00:57:06.763
ASHLEY: Oh no.

00:57:06.763 --> 00:57:07.770
MATT: -- and locks them on.

00:57:07.770 --> 00:57:09.187
LAURA: This is the second time you've been
arrested!

00:57:09.187 --> 00:57:10.315
MARISHA: Yeah, it is.

00:57:10.315 --> 00:57:13.872
MATT: The guy with spear turns behind you and just
holds it to your back as the gentleman who just

00:57:13.872 --> 00:57:16.630
cuffed you grabs the chain between and starts
pulling you towards the main chamber.

00:57:16.630 --> 00:57:20.402
MARISHA: You know, can we just buzz by the front
foyer, and then we'll find my friends, and then

00:57:20.402 --> 00:57:23.257
we'll all be like, hey, those are my-- It'll be
fine.

00:57:23.257 --> 00:57:24.558
ORION: I think that's where you're going.

00:57:24.558 --> 00:57:28.937
MATT: He leads you down the stairway to an area
where it opens up into a small courtyard, takes

00:57:28.937 --> 00:57:34.350
you to the right of the courtyard into a central
chamber, where the rest of Vox Machina is

00:57:34.350 --> 00:57:35.565
currently being led.

00:57:35.565 --> 00:57:36.694
LAURA: Keyleth!

00:57:36.694 --> 00:57:37.811
ORION: Do I see her?

00:57:37.811 --> 00:57:39.945
MATT: Yeah, you guys all see her being led in, in
cuffs, essentially.

00:57:39.945 --> 00:57:42.701
ORION: Seriously? Again?

00:57:42.701 --> 00:57:44.064
TRAVIS: What did you do?

00:57:44.064 --> 00:57:45.075
LAURA: Again, Keyleth?

00:57:45.075 --> 00:57:46.249
ORION: Your Highness, what is your problem?

00:57:46.249 --> 00:57:50.084
ASHLEY: Oh. She's with us. She's with us, she was
just outside, we got in before.

00:57:50.084 --> 00:57:51.586
TRAVIS: No, we don't know who she is.

00:57:51.586 --> 00:57:53.607
TALIESIN: Actually, can we have a few minutes to
discuss this?

00:57:53.795 --> 00:57:54.893
MARISHA: Shut up, Grog!

00:57:54.893 --> 00:57:58.159
MATT: At this point, Kima turns and says, "She's
with me."

00:57:58.159 --> 00:57:59.193
LAURA: Oh.

00:57:59.193 --> 00:58:03.635
MATT: And both the Scalebearers go, "Lady Kima, I
am so sorry." And they go ahead and take the cuffs

00:58:03.635 --> 00:58:05.925
off real fast and pull the spear back and step
back.

00:58:05.925 --> 00:58:06.741
ASHLEY: Wow.

00:58:06.741 --> 00:58:07.818
LAURA: Yeah, you listen to Lady Kima.

00:58:07.818 --> 00:58:08.594
ORION: The classic.

00:58:08.594 --> 00:58:09.432
MARISHA: The classic.

00:58:09.432 --> 00:58:10.536
ORION: The classic handcuff wrist twist.

00:58:10.536 --> 00:58:11.703
MARISHA: Ouch.

00:58:11.703 --> 00:58:13.061
LIAM: Hardass.

00:58:13.061 --> 00:58:14.455
(laughter)

00:58:14.455 --> 00:58:16.777
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm with her.

00:58:16.777 --> 00:58:20.488
MATT: They back off and bow deeply and escort
themselves off, embarrassed.

00:58:20.488 --> 00:58:21.580
MARISHA: Did you guys see that?

00:58:21.580 --> 00:58:22.576
ASHLEY: That was cool.

00:58:22.576 --> 00:58:23.765
ORION: I nudge Grog.

00:58:23.765 --> 00:58:25.068
TRAVIS: That was cool. You were arrested.

00:58:25.068 --> 00:58:26.739
ORION: Grog, Grog, I'm nudging you.

00:58:26.739 --> 00:58:27.896
TRAVIS: You hadn't done anything.

00:58:27.896 --> 00:58:28.854
TALIESIN: I knew you had it in you.

00:58:28.854 --> 00:58:30.014
MARISHA: I'm starting to feel so hardcore.

00:58:30.014 --> 00:58:31.001
ORION: I'm just nudging you.

00:58:31.001 --> 00:58:31.787
TRAVIS: Oh, okay.

00:58:31.787 --> 00:58:33.093
ORION: Because Kima did something super hot.

00:58:33.093 --> 00:58:33.999
TALIESIN: You need a tattoo.

00:58:33.999 --> 00:58:35.028
MARISHA: I do need a tattoo.

00:58:35.028 --> 00:58:36.907
TRAVIS: I know, I noticed. She doesn't love me,
though.

00:58:36.907 --> 00:58:38.147
LAURA: She does, Grog.

00:58:38.147 --> 00:58:39.233
TRAVIS: No, not yet.

00:58:39.233 --> 00:58:42.452
MATT: All right. Scalebearer Yonn continues to
lead you through this main chamber. And this

00:58:42.452 --> 00:58:46.121
chamber, like I said, it's the temple. It's
strange, because most temples you've seen to

00:58:46.121 --> 00:58:50.906
Bahamut or many other deities are extravagant or
are, you know, built with a modern-day sense of

00:58:50.906 --> 00:58:58.895
architecture. This is a very plain, simple stone
fortress. It's hard to grasp what time it was

00:58:58.895 --> 00:59:04.398
built, but just the smell itself seems very
ancient. There's a scent of dust and age, and

00:59:04.398 --> 00:59:11.919
functionality to its construct. But there's still
a sense of power to it. Especially you, Pike,

00:59:11.919 --> 00:59:16.533
where you're sensitive to divine energy. This
whole place is humming with it. Even though it's

00:59:16.533 --> 00:59:22.197
not the kind you're used to connecting with. This
is-- When they say this is a holy place, you can

00:59:22.197 --> 00:59:23.701
feel it.

00:59:23.701 --> 00:59:26.151
LAURA: Is everything okay, Pike?

00:59:26.151 --> 00:59:31.974
ASHLEY: It's just-- there's a lot of holiness
here.

00:59:31.974 --> 00:59:33.696
(laughter)

00:59:33.696 --> 00:59:34.794
ORION: I would imagine.

00:59:34.794 --> 00:59:35.709
MARISHA: Oh.

00:59:35.709 --> 00:59:37.783
SAM: On a scale from one to five, five being super
holy--

00:59:37.783 --> 00:59:39.546
ASHLEY: Probably six.

00:59:39.546 --> 00:59:40.369
SAM: Whoa.

00:59:40.369 --> 00:59:41.229
LAURA: Whoa.

00:59:41.229 --> 00:59:42.066
MARISHA: (gasps)

00:59:42.066 --> 00:59:43.151
ORION: That's extra holy.

00:59:43.151 --> 00:59:44.266
MARISHA: This temple goes to six.

00:59:44.266 --> 00:59:46.704
ASHLEY: This temple, I mean this--

00:59:46.704 --> 00:59:47.971
ORION: (laughs) This temple goes to six.

00:59:47.971 --> 00:59:51.369
ASHLEY: Just this whole land in particular. I mean
there's a lot, there's a lot here, but--

00:59:51.369 --> 00:59:52.593
ORION: That is good, though.

00:59:52.593 --> 00:59:53.604
ASHLEY: Yes, good.

00:59:53.604 --> 00:59:56.053
SAM: Do you need a moment? Do you need to sit
down? Do you need me to hold you?

00:59:56.053 --> 00:59:58.239
ASHLEY: I think I'm okay to keep going.

00:59:58.239 --> 00:59:59.382
LAURA: All right.

00:59:59.382 --> 01:00:02.994
ASHLEY: But maybe later. We'll see. If I get a
little tired.

01:00:02.994 --> 01:00:08.668
MATT: At which you feel a nudge at your side and
it's an armored elbow from Kima, saying, "If you

01:00:08.831 --> 01:00:13.436
"wouldn't mind holding off on the fraternizing in
the temple of Bahamut, I would really appreciate it."

01:00:13.436 --> 01:00:14.891
MARISHA: Oh, that's right.

01:00:14.891 --> 01:00:16.275
SAM: Message understood.

01:00:16.275 --> 01:00:22.620
MATT: At which point Scalebearer Yonn is now at
the second set of double doors and he presents his

01:00:22.620 --> 01:00:27.130
holy symbol above his chest, it glows a second,
and what was originally just smooth stone doors, you

01:00:27.246 --> 01:00:31.858
see a divine glow and the symbol of Bahamut you
saw at the front of the temple appear for a

01:00:32.019 --> 01:00:37.865
moment, and then as it vanishes the two doors open
on their own into a central worship chamber. This

01:00:37.865 --> 01:00:44.017
is a much larger domed room. It looks like it goes
up about 80 feet to the top of the ceiling, and

01:00:44.017 --> 01:00:50.376
the dome itself has what looks like an extremely
ancient, detailed drawing, like Sistine

01:00:50.376 --> 01:00:57.535
Chapel-style, the tale of the entirety of
creation. You see all the elemental planes

01:00:57.605 --> 01:01:02.192
represented in the corners, the theoretical
corners, where corners would be in a domed room.

01:01:02.192 --> 01:01:09.970
You can see a crude representation of how all the
planes lay over each other, you can see the Astral

01:01:09.970 --> 01:01:14.200
Plane, you can see where the Nine Hells would
exist, and the Abyss itself, and in the center

01:01:14.200 --> 01:01:19.255
there's the Prime Material Plane, and across it
you see a giant image of the great platinum dragon

01:01:19.255 --> 01:01:23.792
Bahamut drawn in all of his glory, currently
snapping down on one of the throats of a

01:01:23.792 --> 01:01:29.098
multi-headed dragon. This other dragon, with five
different heads of five different chromatic

01:01:29.098 --> 01:01:32.867
colors, and this struggle between what you know to
be Bahamut and Tiamat.

01:01:32.867 --> 01:01:34.105
TRAVIS: Tiamat?

01:01:34.105 --> 01:01:35.242
MATT: Tiamat.

01:01:35.242 --> 01:01:36.604
LAURA: Is that the bad one?

01:01:36.604 --> 01:01:37.873
MATT: You gather.

01:01:37.873 --> 01:01:40.189
LIAM: That is the baddest one.

01:01:40.237 --> 01:01:42.688
LAURA: I mean, I know that because I know a lot
about dragons.

01:01:42.688 --> 01:01:43.695
MATT: Indeed.

01:01:43.695 --> 01:01:49.518
MARISHA: Whoa. Do I see or learn anything about
the elemental planes that I didn't know before?

01:01:49.518 --> 01:01:51.583
MATT: Not from the artwork. It's very pretty.

01:01:51.583 --> 01:01:53.033
MARISHA: Ah, so pretty.

01:01:53.033 --> 01:01:56.868
ORION: I take it all in and I'm reminded of one of
the museums at home.

01:01:56.868 --> 01:02:02.458
MATT: And actually, you've seen this art piece in
a book. It's been a long time, but you know that

01:02:02.458 --> 01:02:07.893
this has been studied before and exists somewhere
in Draconia, the tome that talks about this exact

01:02:07.893 --> 01:02:08.778
temple.

01:02:08.778 --> 01:02:09.861
TRAVIS: A book?

01:02:09.861 --> 01:02:11.316
MARISHA: We just made cave drawings, I don't--

01:02:11.316 --> 01:02:13.074
SAM: That's those square things.

01:02:13.074 --> 01:02:15.224
ORION: The square things with all the paper leaves
in them and squiggles.

01:02:15.224 --> 01:02:16.090
TRAVIS: Right.

01:02:16.090 --> 01:02:17.571
LAURA: Is Tiamat still alive? Is he still around?

01:02:17.571 --> 01:02:19.108
ORION: I read a lot of those. Can't put my finger
on it.

01:02:19.108 --> 01:02:21.954
MATT: At which point both Yonn and Kima and the
Scalebearers kind of turn to you with a look of--

01:02:21.954 --> 01:02:29.594
kind of understanding that you don't quite know,
but also the fear and the knowledge that-- they

01:02:29.594 --> 01:02:32.515
don't say anything, they just give you a look that
says, yes, very much so.

01:02:32.515 --> 01:02:38.179
LAURA: Oh. I mean. (nervous laugh) Tiamat's still
around, huh?

01:02:38.179 --> 01:02:40.329
ORION: Unfortunately, yes.

01:02:40.329 --> 01:02:41.452
MATT: They continue walking.

01:02:41.452 --> 01:02:42.260
LAURA: Oh.

01:02:42.260 --> 01:02:49.277
MATT: Now, the floor of this chamber, which is a
very simple stone, you can see there are small

01:02:49.277 --> 01:02:56.082
sculptures, each one representing some sort of a
humanoid entity dressed in similar robes to the

01:02:56.082 --> 01:03:01.429
other envoys and members of this temple that
you've encountered thus far. Some of them are in

01:03:01.429 --> 01:03:05.960
full armor, some are wearing just robes, and
they're very, very old. Some of them seem a little

01:03:05.960 --> 01:03:11.151
more recent, and you gather these each have some
sort of cultural or religious significance to this

01:03:11.151 --> 01:03:16.568
temple. However, one of these is not a statue. In
the center of this worship chamber, which is

01:03:16.568 --> 01:03:24.536
strangely, eerily quiet, there is one humanoid
that turns to the rest of you. What you see before

01:03:24.536 --> 01:03:34.274
you is a slender, elven male draped in long, white
robes that drag a few feet behind his form across

01:03:34.332 --> 01:03:44.413
the ground. He has jet-- not jet, stark-white hair
that is slicked back against his head, no facial

01:03:44.413 --> 01:03:53.577
hair, frail but very handsome features. Elves,
when they age, they age very gracefully--

01:03:53.577 --> 01:03:55.090
LAURA: Yeah we do.

01:03:55.090 --> 01:03:56.434
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:03:56.434 --> 01:03:59.001
MATT: -- and from the look of most elves you've
seen, this is a very old elf that has aged very

01:03:59.001 --> 01:04:08.099
gracefully. He turns to the rest of you and you
see across his neck a very, very well-crafted,

01:04:08.099 --> 01:04:16.608
intricate series of draconic symbols that finishes
with a giant emblem of Bahamut himself. His voice

01:04:16.608 --> 01:04:21.289
rings out and echoes throughout the hallway as you
approach, each footstep echoing as you get closer.

01:04:21.289 --> 01:04:30.577
"Welcome, everyone, to the Platinum Sanctuary. I
am called Highbearer Vord."

01:04:30.577 --> 01:04:32.876
LAURA: Oh, right.

01:04:32.876 --> 01:04:39.047
MATT: "Keeper of this most holy of places. I
received word from a disciple of mine--" At which

01:04:39.047 --> 01:04:47.220
Kima has now stepped forward, and bows, kneels
before him and says, "Your holiness." At which he

01:04:47.220 --> 01:04:53.222
looks down with a smile. "Ah, Kima. I am pleased
to see you. It has been a long time, my disciple."

01:04:53.222 --> 01:04:59.573
He looks up to the rest of the group. "I
understand you carry something of terrible omen.

01:04:59.573 --> 01:05:07.083
"Let us discuss how to be rid of it. Please.
Present the container."

01:05:07.083 --> 01:05:08.571
LAURA: Right here?

01:05:08.571 --> 01:05:13.970
MATT: The Scalebearers step forward and set the
container on the ground. They go to reach for it

01:05:13.970 --> 01:05:19.279
and he goes, "No no no. Do not open it." And he
kind of takes a second and holds his symbol to his

01:05:19.279 --> 01:05:23.361
chest and closes his eyes, and you can see this
kind of divine glow pulse off

01:05:23.361 --> 01:05:24.658
of him for a second.

01:05:24.658 --> 01:05:25.990
MARISHA: Kima, what's happening?

01:05:25.990 --> 01:05:27.182
MATT: She goes, "Shh, shh."

01:05:27.182 --> 01:05:28.292
MARISHA: Okay.

01:05:28.292 --> 01:05:33.659
MATT: The box begins to pulse with the divine
light as well, and then suddenly vanishes and he

01:05:33.659 --> 01:05:43.652
kind of (gasps) catches his breath. "It is as you
said. This must be sealed immediately."

01:05:43.652 --> 01:05:44.659
ORION: Well, yes.

01:05:44.659 --> 01:05:46.958
MARISHA: Yeah-huh. We could have just told you
that.

01:05:46.958 --> 01:05:51.348
MATT: He gives a look to the rest of the group
here, and you can see there's a noticeable bead of

01:05:51.348 --> 01:05:58.444
sweat he kind of wipes off his forehead. "I just
needed to confirm that this was not some

01:05:58.507 --> 01:06:06.827
"haphazardly constructed fake or some other
artifact mistaken for such a horn, but we indeed

01:06:06.983 --> 01:06:09.962
"have within our presence one of the Horns of
Orcus, and this does not bode well."

01:06:09.962 --> 01:06:11.559
LAURA: (whistles)

01:06:11.559 --> 01:06:12.566
MATT: "Thankfully--"

01:06:12.566 --> 01:06:13.797
LAURA: Are you guys-- oh, sorry.

01:06:13.797 --> 01:06:15.166
MATT: "No, please. What do you want to say?"

01:06:15.166 --> 01:06:18.424
LAURA: I was just wondering. You've had one of
these before, yes?

01:06:18.424 --> 01:06:25.816
MATT: "No, but we know that these exist. A few of
us do; the knowledge itself has been lost to time

01:06:25.816 --> 01:06:36.902
"intentionally. It was brought to my attention, and
through discussions with the Council that sent you

01:06:36.902 --> 01:06:42.824
"on this journey, that this would be the safest
place to seal such an artifact, and amongst all

01:06:42.824 --> 01:06:52.047
"our other options, as of this time, I see no other
choice. So. What's been proposed. Allow me to

01:06:52.047 --> 01:06:58.009
"explain to you the plan. One of our most divine
relics of our most beloved protector Bahamut was

01:06:58.009 --> 01:07:08.420
"kept deep beneath this temple, within the mountain
we rest against. The Star of Exaltation, a crystal

01:07:08.575 --> 01:07:14.542
"born from the tear Bahamut shed for the sacrifices
his first devoted made in the Great War of the

01:07:14.542 --> 01:07:22.215
"Beginnings, the Dawn War. This item was
unfortunately lost nearly 300 years ago, giving

01:07:22.215 --> 01:07:27.828
"the last of its power to protect this very
Vasselheim. The intervention it brought from our

01:07:27.983 --> 01:07:36.935
"great deity expended and left the artifact
destroyed. Since the chamber that held this Star,

01:07:36.935 --> 01:07:44.263
"a blessed and ever-watched nexus beneath the gaze
of the Great Platinum Dragon Himself, has gone

01:07:44.263 --> 01:07:51.877
"empty, we've tended to it. We've kept it fairly
well-watched and in the state it was originally

01:07:51.877 --> 01:08:00.362
"constructed for. And we think no greater location
to seal such a deeply-rooted evil exists within

01:08:00.362 --> 01:08:09.226
"our spheres of influence or any other.
Unfortunately, the last time the chamber was

01:08:09.226 --> 01:08:17.074
"cleansed and prepared was some 15 years ago.
Our curate tasked one of our own Scalebearers--"

01:08:17.074 --> 01:08:24.281
And he looks over towards Yonn, who sheepishly
backs away. "-- was tasked with preparing it for

01:08:24.281 --> 01:08:34.899
"your arrival, and the artifact's, and it was found
that the lower chambers have been infested with

01:08:34.899 --> 01:08:38.442
"some manner of foul subterranean spider
creature."

01:08:38.442 --> 01:08:40.014
MARISHA: Oh, man.

01:08:40.014 --> 01:08:47.418
MATT: "Our Scalebearer fled." At which point Yonn
leaves the entire conversation and exits the room.

01:08:47.418 --> 01:08:48.471
ASHLEY: (quietly) Excuse me.

01:08:48.471 --> 01:08:49.579
SAM: Yonn.

01:08:49.579 --> 01:08:52.060
MATT: You hear Kima kind of give a spit in his
direction.

01:08:52.060 --> 01:08:58.436
MATT: "But not before initiating the vault's
defenses."

01:08:58.637 --> 01:09:08.229
(sighs) "So thus, I ask you to complete your
journey into the Hall of the Exalt below, clear

01:09:08.229 --> 01:09:14.730
"out these meager beasts, and guide your reliquary
into the vault chamber to seal it for good."

01:09:14.730 --> 01:09:17.564
ORION: Will we have to contend with the defense
systems as well?

01:09:17.564 --> 01:09:23.667
MATT: "Not all of them, but apparently in his
haste to escape and defend himself, he set a few

01:09:23.716 --> 01:09:26.617
of them to aid his escape."

01:09:26.617 --> 01:09:28.567
LAURA: Great. (shouts) Good job, Yonn!

01:09:28.567 --> 01:09:29.927
MARISHA: Thanks, Yonn.

01:09:29.927 --> 01:09:31.413
MATT: You hear no response other than the
pitter-patter of steps.

01:09:31.413 --> 01:09:32.770
SAM: Why does he still work here?

01:09:32.770 --> 01:09:34.612
TRAVIS: (laughs) Right?

01:09:34.612 --> 01:09:36.440
ORION: (laughs) Very good question.

01:09:36.440 --> 01:09:37.903
TALIESIN: Would you like to speak to his manager?

01:09:37.903 --> 01:09:39.768
SAM: Does he have tenure or something? Is it a
union thing?

01:09:39.768 --> 01:09:46.279
MATT: "He's been with us for many, many years, and
he has great heart and devotion. Though addled may

01:09:46.279 --> 01:09:48.500
"be his mind, he does bring much to the temple."

01:09:48.500 --> 01:09:49.842
MARISHA: He has seniority.

01:09:49.842 --> 01:09:50.821
SAM: All right.

01:09:50.821 --> 01:09:54.984
MARISHA: So wait, you said you lost the Crystal of
Exaltation during the War of--

01:09:54.984 --> 01:09:58.583
MATT: "It was destroyed during a siege of the
city."

01:09:58.583 --> 01:10:00.156
MARISHA: During the War of what? Beginnings?

01:10:00.156 --> 01:10:01.782
MATT: "The War of the Beginnings."

01:10:01.782 --> 01:10:02.907
MARISHA: The War of the Beginnings.

01:10:02.907 --> 01:10:05.069
TALIESIN: That was close.

01:10:05.069 --> 01:10:08.376
MARISHA: And how long ago was this War of the
Beginnings?

01:10:08.533 --> 01:10:11.258
MATT: "Well that, oh, I'm sorry. It was created in
the War of the Beginnings."

01:10:11.258 --> 01:10:12.550
MARISHA: It was created then?

01:10:12.550 --> 01:10:15.902
MATT: "It was lost in a battle, a siege of the
city of Vasselheim 300 years ago."

01:10:15.902 --> 01:10:17.220
LAURA: 300 years?

01:10:17.220 --> 01:10:18.665
MARISHA: Called what? During what war?

01:10:18.665 --> 01:10:19.968
TALIESIN: The Siege of the Metal Champions.

01:10:19.968 --> 01:10:21.402
MATT: "That had no particular name."

01:10:21.402 --> 01:10:22.144
MARISHA: Oh.

01:10:22.144 --> 01:10:22.954
LAURA: Oh.

01:10:22.954 --> 01:10:23.875
MARISHA: Just a siege.

01:10:23.875 --> 01:10:24.675
LAURA: It was just a thing?

01:10:24.675 --> 01:10:25.644
MATT: "It was one of the sieges and there was--"

01:10:25.644 --> 01:10:26.709
SAM: The Battle Where the Thing Was Lost.

01:10:26.709 --> 01:10:27.597
MATT: Yes. There it is.

01:10:27.597 --> 01:10:28.347
ORION: Right.

01:10:28.347 --> 01:10:29.387
(laughter)

01:10:29.387 --> 01:10:35.687
LIAM: Vord. Hi. Question, please. We'll clear out
your basement, that's not a problem. I'd like to

01:10:35.687 --> 01:10:43.525
understand how you plan to protect this horn, how
you plan to keep it out of the hands of entities

01:10:43.525 --> 01:10:45.111
who would use it for ill--

01:10:45.111 --> 01:10:49.115
LAURA: That big scary creature living out in the
woods. Sorry, brother.

01:10:49.115 --> 01:10:50.741
LIAM: Then how-- that's fine.

01:10:50.741 --> 01:10:53.442
MATT: He glances towards you and says, "Oh, that
is but one of many."

01:10:53.442 --> 01:10:54.417
LAURA: Huh.

01:10:54.417 --> 01:11:02.639
MATT: "Let it be known that this temple is
extremely well-guarded. It is continuously under

01:11:02.639 --> 01:11:11.230
"the gaze of our patron deity and while some of the
defenses have been put in place for your arrival,

01:11:11.230 --> 01:11:19.839
"if the entirety of the vault is triggered, there
is nothing that will make its way there

01:11:19.839 --> 01:11:22.025
"unannounced."

01:11:22.025 --> 01:11:24.082
TRAVIS: Good sell.

01:11:24.082 --> 01:11:29.644
SAM: Are we to carry the box down as we journey
into the dungeons below, or are we to leave it

01:11:29.644 --> 01:11:31.828
here while we go clear out the basement?

01:11:31.828 --> 01:11:33.266
MATT: "The Scalebearers will bring it with you."

01:11:33.266 --> 01:11:34.165
SAM: Okay.

01:11:34.165 --> 01:11:35.311
MATT: "Keep them safe."

01:11:35.311 --> 01:11:38.906
SAM: Keep them safe? Oh. All right. We've got
enough to worry about keeping ourselves safe.

01:11:38.906 --> 01:11:48.359
MARISHA: So just to get one thing clear, and I
mean no (clears throat) disrespect, but how was

01:11:48.359 --> 01:11:55.005
the crystal lost 300 years ago, if it was in this
chamber? So this chamber has been

01:11:55.005 --> 01:11:56.241
broken into before?

01:11:56.241 --> 01:12:03.698
MATT: "We can enter the chamber under very
specific circumstances. We, at the time, requested

01:12:03.698 --> 01:12:09.442
"the use of the Star of Exaltation as a divine
focus--"

01:12:09.442 --> 01:12:10.578
MARISHA: Oh.

01:12:10.578 --> 01:12:14.304
MATT: "-- a ritual that required the intervention
of Bahamut to keep the city safe."

01:12:14.304 --> 01:12:17.839
MARISHA: Oh, so someone brought it out and then
was clumsy and lost it.

01:12:17.839 --> 01:12:19.013
LAURA: And then it was lost.

01:12:19.013 --> 01:12:20.095
SAM: And you know what--

01:12:20.095 --> 01:12:22.337
MATT: "It wasn't clumsy and lost. It was used as a
focus in the ritual."

01:12:22.337 --> 01:12:23.051
MARISHA: Oh.

01:12:23.051 --> 01:12:28.859
MATT: "It was by the will of Bahamut Himself that
the Star no longer was required to exist on this plane."

01:12:28.859 --> 01:12:30.214
ORION: She gets it. She gets it.

01:12:30.214 --> 01:12:31.254
MATT: "It served its purpose."

01:12:31.254 --> 01:12:32.448
MARISHA: So it was destroyed.

01:12:32.448 --> 01:12:33.571
LAURA: Lost, as in--

01:12:33.571 --> 01:12:35.332
ORION: Like not around.

01:12:35.332 --> 01:12:38.419
MARISHA: You should change your verbage here.

01:12:38.419 --> 01:12:40.568
TALIESIN: Charisma of ten, ladies and gentlemen.
Charisma of ten.

01:12:40.568 --> 01:12:45.525
LAURA: While everybody's been talking, can I have
used my Primeval Awareness to see within six miles

01:12:45.525 --> 01:12:47.264
if there's any dragons around us?

01:12:47.264 --> 01:12:52.560
SAM: (sings) Primeval Awareness, yeah.

01:12:52.560 --> 01:13:03.489
MATT: So you take a moment and kind of zone out
for a second. You do not sense any dragons in the

01:13:03.489 --> 01:13:06.119
immediate vicinity of the six-mile radius of the
city, no.

01:13:06.119 --> 01:13:09.010
LAURA: Oh, okay. All right. That's all I wanted to
know.

01:13:09.010 --> 01:13:13.622
SAM: (sings) Primeval Awareness, over.

01:13:13.775 --> 01:13:18.212
TRAVIS: Can we drop off this box, or what? I want
to go see the fire dancers.

01:13:18.212 --> 01:13:20.016
SAM: Yeah, let's go.

01:13:20.016 --> 01:13:24.261
LAURA: No, we need to go-- we also need to-- are
we going to do that now?

01:13:24.261 --> 01:13:25.483
SAM: Let's just go.

01:13:25.483 --> 01:13:26.994
LAURA: Go clear out the basement?

01:13:26.994 --> 01:13:28.282
SAM: Yeah, it's the morning, still. Okay? Let's
go.

01:13:28.282 --> 01:13:29.438
ORION: Are we all potioned up, are we all--

01:13:29.438 --> 01:13:30.315
MARISHA: Yeah, we're good.

01:13:30.315 --> 01:13:31.184
ASHLEY: We're all healed.

01:13:31.184 --> 01:13:31.872
ORION: We're good?

01:13:31.872 --> 01:13:32.846
LAURA: Let's clear out the basement.

01:13:32.846 --> 01:13:33.800
TRAVIS: There's nothing down there, right?

01:13:33.800 --> 01:13:34.952
LAURA: Yeah? I mean, you want us to do it now,
yeah?

01:13:34.952 --> 01:13:37.042
TALIESIN: I'm not-- I haven't been paying
attention.

01:13:37.042 --> 01:13:41.056
MATT: "Lest this artifact be left longer in the
open, which I would not be comfortable with."

01:13:41.056 --> 01:13:42.161
LAURA: No, neither would I.

01:13:42.161 --> 01:13:43.744
MATT: "I would prefer this be taken care of
immediately."

01:13:43.744 --> 01:13:44.680
TRAVIS: Yeah, we'll do it now.

01:13:44.680 --> 01:13:45.580
SAM: Let's go do it.

01:13:45.580 --> 01:13:46.543
TALIESIN: We've got a bear.

01:13:46.543 --> 01:13:49.188
LAURA: I mean, obviously we want the Horn taken
care of, but--

01:13:49.236 --> 01:13:50.606
TRAVIS: Here we go.

01:13:50.606 --> 01:13:52.630
LAURA: -- you know, we're taking care of a problem
for you, too.

01:13:52.630 --> 01:13:54.074
SAM: Oh, here it goes.

01:13:54.074 --> 01:13:54.934
TRAVIS: Here it comes.

01:13:54.934 --> 01:13:55.895
SAM: Here it goes.

01:13:55.895 --> 01:13:56.825
ASHLEY: Get it, girl.

01:13:56.825 --> 01:13:57.586
TRAVIS: Son of a bitch.

01:13:57.586 --> 01:13:58.547
ASHLEY: Get it, girl. Get it.

01:13:58.547 --> 01:14:00.129
LIAM: The holiest place on the map.

01:14:00.129 --> 01:14:01.091
ASHLEY: Yeah. (laughs)

01:14:01.091 --> 01:14:02.274
LAURA: The holiest place?

01:14:02.274 --> 01:14:03.653
SAM: Haggle with the pope.

01:14:03.653 --> 01:14:05.388
TALIESIN: Shaking down the pope.

01:14:05.388 --> 01:14:07.949
MATT: "You want a monetary reward--"

01:14:07.949 --> 01:14:09.492
LAURA: I was just wondering.

01:14:09.492 --> 01:14:11.013
MATT: "-- for your aid."

01:14:11.175 --> 01:14:12.098
LAURA: I'm not asking.

01:14:12.098 --> 01:14:17.991
MATT: "The temple can provide a sum of three
thousand gold pieces."

01:14:17.991 --> 01:14:21.008
LAURA: Per party member, yes?

01:14:21.008 --> 01:14:26.359
MATT: "Entirely. Three thousand gold pieces for
your trouble on this journey." At which Kima steps

01:14:26.359 --> 01:14:31.123
forward and says, "Highbearer, we do not need to
take money from--"

01:14:31.123 --> 01:14:34.035
LAURA: We don't want money, of course not. I mean,
I--

01:14:34.035 --> 01:14:38.079
SAM: But think of the good we could do with that
money, giving alms to the poor back home where we are.

01:14:38.079 --> 01:14:42.229
LAURA: Yes, spreading the word of Bahamut where we
go.

01:14:42.229 --> 01:14:43.833
ASHLEY: Are we going to return for it?

01:14:43.833 --> 01:14:51.467
SAM: We do a lot of charity work and it would be
well-received back home. (under his breath) In our Keep.

01:14:51.467 --> 01:14:54.249
MATT: You make a persuasion roll. You make a
deception roll.

01:14:54.249 --> 01:14:55.268
SAM: Deception?

01:14:55.268 --> 01:14:58.522
LAURA: It's not a deception, we really will--

01:14:58.522 --> 01:14:59.988
TRAVIS: No, no. Only one of you.

01:14:59.988 --> 01:15:01.254
MATT: (laughs) No, he won't.

01:15:01.254 --> 01:15:04.002
TALIESIN: The ladies of the evening really, really
do need the money, apparently.

01:15:04.002 --> 01:15:05.136
MARISHA: (laughs) No, he won't.

01:15:05.136 --> 01:15:06.413
TRAVIS: What did you roll, Sam?

01:15:06.413 --> 01:15:07.161
SAM: A 30.

01:15:07.161 --> 01:15:07.836
ORION: (laughs)

01:15:07.836 --> 01:15:09.263
LAURA: Oh. That's really good because I rolled a
19. Wait!

01:15:09.263 --> 01:15:09.961
MARISHA: A 30?

01:15:09.961 --> 01:15:10.849
ASHLEY: No, you didn't.

01:15:10.849 --> 01:15:11.581
LAURA: Yeah, I did.

01:15:11.581 --> 01:15:12.339
LIAM: Three-zero?

01:15:12.339 --> 01:15:15.447
SAM: Three-zero! I have a +13 for deception.
(laughs)

01:15:15.499 --> 01:15:16.456
TRAVIS: Really?

01:15:16.456 --> 01:15:17.412
(laughter)

01:15:17.412 --> 01:15:18.514
TALIESIN: That explains so much.

01:15:18.514 --> 01:15:19.809
TRAVIS: We've got to get you deceiving more.

01:15:19.809 --> 01:15:21.706
MARISHA: (laughs) We've got to get you deceiving
more.

01:15:21.706 --> 01:15:24.857
TRAVIS: Oh my god.

01:15:24.857 --> 01:15:26.826
MARISHA: You should lie more. It's good.

01:15:26.826 --> 01:15:28.707
TALIESIN: Lie to me, Pinocchio. Lie to me.

01:15:28.707 --> 01:15:33.169
MATT: "Three thousand gold, at your disposal, to
bring about and to share in the prosperity of your

01:15:33.169 --> 01:15:35.264
"people back home."

01:15:35.264 --> 01:15:36.363
SAM: Amen.

01:15:36.363 --> 01:15:37.648
(laughter)

01:15:37.648 --> 01:15:39.795
MATT: "Once the artifact is delivered and
sealed."

01:15:39.795 --> 01:15:47.598
SAM: From one holy man to another, I think we've
struck a deal. Let's go.

01:15:47.598 --> 01:15:51.372
ORION: Burt Reynolds, you've done it again.

01:15:51.372 --> 01:15:52.651
TRAVIS: Amen.

01:15:52.651 --> 01:15:54.791
(laughter)

01:15:54.791 --> 01:16:05.749
MATT: As you all turn, Kima goes, "I'll show you
to the vault room."

01:16:05.749 --> 01:16:07.294
LAURA: Are you going to come with us, Kima?

01:16:07.294 --> 01:16:08.406
MATT: "Yes, I'm coming with you."

01:16:08.406 --> 01:16:09.435
LAURA: Oh, good.

01:16:09.435 --> 01:16:12.257
MATT: She glances over at you. (sarcastically)
"Shall we, holy man?"

01:16:12.257 --> 01:16:14.387
(laughter)

01:16:14.387 --> 01:16:16.605
SAM: Why yes, my sister, lead the way.

01:16:16.605 --> 01:16:17.832
MARISHA: Sister.

01:16:17.832 --> 01:16:19.615
(laughter)

01:16:19.615 --> 01:16:23.709
MATT: As you guys are walking out of the chamber,
the doors close behind, she turns to you and says,

01:16:23.709 --> 01:16:29.562
"Is that why you were blessed with such a
temporarily swollen appendage before?"

01:16:29.623 --> 01:16:32.067
SAM: I don't know how the lord works, it's
mysterious.

01:16:32.067 --> 01:16:36.506
(laughter)

01:16:36.506 --> 01:16:42.325
MATT: "Let us be on our way." She kind of walks
off, flustered and frustrated. You guys are led

01:16:42.325 --> 01:16:48.383
down two layers. This actual temple recedes
further and further into the mountain, until

01:16:48.383 --> 01:16:55.610
you're led into what seems to almost be a storage
basement. It's a very musty smell. It's old earth--

01:16:55.610 --> 01:16:58.925
ORION: It's dank down here.

01:16:58.925 --> 01:17:06.922
MATT: Yeah, it kind of has that moldy scent to it.
There are five guards stationed in this storage

01:17:06.922 --> 01:17:13.067
vicinity, and as you approach, they all stand up.
They're all still wearing ceremonial armor, two of

01:17:13.067 --> 01:17:16.131
which you can see are really well-armed, one with
a greatsword and one with a longsword at the side.

01:17:16.131 --> 01:17:22.069
They look pretty prestigious to be assigned to a
basement this terrible.

01:17:22.069 --> 01:17:23.516
LAURA: At ease, soldiers.

01:17:23.516 --> 01:17:26.976
MATT: "Of course, of course."

01:17:26.976 --> 01:17:34.217
MATT: And they step aside. Kima steps forward and
takes her holy symbol and removes it from around

01:17:34.217 --> 01:17:40.216
her neck. She looks at the wall for a second, then
places it into what you didn't see before was some

01:17:40.216 --> 01:17:47.752
sort of a slight recess in the wood. It flashes
with divine energy, and suddenly the wood illusion

01:17:47.752 --> 01:17:53.025
is dispelled and what you see before you is a
stone doorway that begins to slowly shift to the

01:17:53.025 --> 01:17:55.524
side and open up into a staircase.

01:17:55.524 --> 01:18:00.219
LAURA: Are we going to find any of these defenses
right away, or what?

01:18:00.219 --> 01:18:06.168
MATT: Kima kind of gives you a look, shrugs, and,
"To be perfectly honest, I have not been within

01:18:06.168 --> 01:18:07.367
"the vault."

01:18:07.367 --> 01:18:08.365
TALIESIN: Well.

01:18:08.365 --> 01:18:09.517
ASHLEY: Okay.

01:18:09.517 --> 01:18:11.971
MARISHA: Huh. Is there a blueprint somewhere?

01:18:11.971 --> 01:18:14.625
TRAVIS: Liam, you're up. I mean, (clears throat)
Vax.

01:18:14.625 --> 01:18:16.883
SAM: I thought he was Vex.

01:18:16.883 --> 01:18:23.577
LIAM: Sorry, my communication earring was a little
low there. What was said?

01:18:23.577 --> 01:18:25.729
LAURA: Check for some traps, brother.

01:18:25.729 --> 01:18:30.950
LIAM: You got it. You got it. I'm glad to get out
of upstairs, I mutter to my sister, because the

01:18:30.950 --> 01:18:32.976
decor up there was shit.

01:18:32.976 --> 01:18:34.395
MARISHA: (laughs)

01:18:34.438 --> 01:18:45.610
LIAM: That is... high. That was a 26.

01:18:45.610 --> 01:18:47.062
MATT: 26 for?

01:18:47.062 --> 01:18:49.156
LAURA: Traps in the stairway.

01:18:49.156 --> 01:18:50.362
LIAM: Just traps.

01:18:50.362 --> 01:18:53.759
MATT: Perception for traps? All right. As you
slowly begin to descend the stairway, you keep an

01:18:53.759 --> 01:18:57.761
eye out across the staircase itself and any of the
surrounding walls. The stonework here is also

01:18:57.761 --> 01:19:03.164
extremely ancient, marking probably a similarity
to the most ancient of buildings you've seen in

01:19:03.164 --> 01:19:12.103
this city. This subterranean structure is probably
one of the older parts of this temple. You don't

01:19:12.103 --> 01:19:18.218
see anything trap-wise. The stairway eventually
comes to an end into a chamber about 50 feet by 50

01:19:18.218 --> 01:19:21.568
feet. It's very, very low light. There appear to
be--

01:19:21.568 --> 01:19:22.947
ORION: Oh! Light!

01:19:22.947 --> 01:19:28.255
MATT: Okay. The brief moment of light, before your
eyes can really focus in, there's a flash of light

01:19:28.255 --> 01:19:33.661
at the end of Tiberius's staff, and the room
actually gets harder to see. You see there is a

01:19:33.661 --> 01:19:38.164
thick white mist that just kind of hangs in the
air throughout the entirety of this room.

01:19:38.164 --> 01:19:39.111
ORION: Oh! (fssh)

01:19:39.111 --> 01:19:40.712
MARISHA: It's like having your high-beams on when
it's foggy.

01:19:40.712 --> 01:19:42.038
ORION: I de-cast Light.

01:19:42.038 --> 01:19:43.457
MATT: Okay. You dispel the Light.

01:19:43.457 --> 01:19:45.161
ORION: What is all of this poppycock?

01:19:45.161 --> 01:19:48.243
MATT: Your eyes adjust a little bit, and you can
see what looks like-- this room, for the most

01:19:48.243 --> 01:19:52.412
part, doesn't have any sort of details. There are
a couple of sconces with low, flickering light

01:19:52.412 --> 01:19:56.115
that are embedded in the side of the walls of this
50 foot by 50 foot room. It's about 20 feet high.

01:19:56.115 --> 01:20:01.119
MARISHA: I go ahead and I do a little Wind Gust
and I go, (blows air).

01:20:01.119 --> 01:20:02.067
MATT: Okay.

01:20:02.067 --> 01:20:03.824
MARISHA: Down the hall, to clear out the fog.

01:20:03.824 --> 01:20:05.505
MATT: Which spell is this?

01:20:05.505 --> 01:20:07.248
MARISHA: Gust of Wind.

01:20:07.248 --> 01:20:13.490
MATT: Okay, so you cast Gust of Wind. The mist
that was filling this room blows out the other

01:20:13.660 --> 01:20:16.060
side and you can see, the room is a little more
visible now.

01:20:16.060 --> 01:20:17.368
ORION: Oh, very good. Light!

01:20:17.368 --> 01:20:21.465
MATT: There's still a light mist on the sides, but
the center of the walkway is clear for a second.

01:20:21.465 --> 01:20:25.945
You see now in the center of the room what were
initially just dark spots in the mist, there are

01:20:25.945 --> 01:20:31.887
two pillars that are attached from ceiling to
floor, roughly about 20 feet apart from each

01:20:31.887 --> 01:20:37.062
other, kind of in the center of each side of the
room. Each pillar is solid gray stone with what

01:20:37.062 --> 01:20:43.771
looks like intricately carved small dragons almost
curling and wrapping around the statues. Each one

01:20:43.881 --> 01:20:48.198
of their heads kind of turned, mouth opened kind
of angrily in different directions.

01:20:48.198 --> 01:20:55.267
LAURA: Can I check for traps or see if there's
anything--

01:20:55.267 --> 01:20:56.686
TRAVIS: You should re-cast that.

01:20:56.686 --> 01:20:57.985
MATT: You guys, both of you guys make perception
checks.

01:20:57.985 --> 01:20:58.893
LAURA: Yeah.

01:20:58.893 --> 01:20:59.848
LIAM: That's a 19.

01:20:59.848 --> 01:21:01.013
LAURA: Oh, he already rolled. Look at him.

01:21:01.013 --> 01:21:01.913
LIAM: Yeah.

01:21:01.913 --> 01:21:03.883
LAURA: Perception?

01:21:03.883 --> 01:21:04.755
MATT: Mm-hm.

01:21:04.755 --> 01:21:05.803
LAURA: 25.

01:21:05.803 --> 01:21:19.045
MATT: So looking about, Liam-- Sorry, Vax. You
notice the base of each one of these pillars is

01:21:19.045 --> 01:21:23.908
not flush with the floor. There is a slight gap,
meaning there is some sort of a rotation or a

01:21:23.908 --> 01:21:25.353
pivot to these pillars.

01:21:25.353 --> 01:21:26.441
LAURA: Hm.

01:21:26.441 --> 01:21:33.595
MATT: You notice that these mouths of the dragons
seem to be what's creating this white mist, and as

01:21:33.595 --> 01:21:37.564
time progresses, the mist begins to refill up the
room rather quickly.

01:21:37.564 --> 01:21:43.716
LAURA: All right. Do I notice any-- does it seem--
Well, without touching it. Any kind of poisonous

01:21:43.716 --> 01:21:45.826
in nature, anything like that?

01:21:45.826 --> 01:21:47.071
MATT: Looks like mist.

01:21:47.071 --> 01:21:48.547
ASHLEY: Should we run through?

01:21:48.547 --> 01:21:52.873
ORION: While we're standing around, I'd like to
reassign the earrings to Vax, Grog, and Scanlan.

01:21:52.873 --> 01:21:58.321
LAURA: I don't get one anymore? You're taking it
off of me right now?

01:21:58.321 --> 01:22:00.705
TRAVIS: Yeah, he's giving it to me. (laughs)

01:22:00.705 --> 01:22:04.747
ORION: Because we're always together, we're always
kind of in the back together, and they're always

01:22:04.747 --> 01:22:06.890
kind of like up in the fray, so--

01:22:06.890 --> 01:22:09.369
TRAVIS: That's true, I do wander off easily.

01:22:09.369 --> 01:22:10.750
SAM: Oh, is that you, Grog?

01:22:10.750 --> 01:22:12.044
TRAVIS: (laughs) Hi. I know.

01:22:12.044 --> 01:22:14.655
ORION: She's always kind of like in the middle.
She's the wild card. He's always in the back with

01:22:14.655 --> 01:22:17.086
us also because we're the ranged dudes.

01:22:17.086 --> 01:22:18.243
LAURA: All right.

01:22:18.243 --> 01:22:19.709
MARISHA: Wait, do I still have one?

01:22:19.709 --> 01:22:23.471
TALIESIN: I'm putting down my mask, just in case
this is awful.

01:22:23.471 --> 01:22:26.852
MATT: Okay. You guys are still at the stairway.
The mist has now filled the room again in front of you.

01:22:26.852 --> 01:22:30.949
LAURA: Ugh. Should we try breathing it and see
what happens?

01:22:30.949 --> 01:22:31.893
SAM: Yeah, sure.

01:22:31.893 --> 01:22:32.894
MARISHA: My Gust of Wind--

01:22:32.894 --> 01:22:34.231
LAURA: I just reach my arm into the mist and just
see--

01:22:34.231 --> 01:22:38.910
MARISHA: My Gust of Wind lasts up to one minute,
by the way, so I can keep--

01:22:38.910 --> 01:22:41.594
LAURA: Oh, maybe we should just not touch the mist
and go straight through the room.

01:22:41.594 --> 01:22:42.728
MARISHA: I'm just airbending.

01:22:42.728 --> 01:22:44.370
MATT: Okay.

01:22:44.370 --> 01:22:45.989
TALIESIN: You've been wanting to say that.

01:22:45.989 --> 01:22:47.860
LAURA: So you can blow it and we just walk
through?

01:22:47.860 --> 01:22:53.444
MATT: As this conversation has continued-- let's
say about 30 or 40 seconds has gone by in

01:22:53.444 --> 01:22:56.799
transferring the earrings and the discussion, so
there's still a little bit of-- there is a clear

01:22:56.799 --> 01:22:58.149
pathway in the center there.

01:22:58.149 --> 01:22:59.089
MARISHA: Not much time.

01:22:59.089 --> 01:22:59.849
SAM: Let's go.

01:22:59.849 --> 01:23:00.403
LAURA: Should we go?

01:23:00.403 --> 01:23:00.936
SAM: Let's go through.

01:23:00.936 --> 01:23:01.800
LAURA: Let's go before it gets back.

01:23:01.800 --> 01:23:02.377
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:23:02.377 --> 01:23:03.260
ASHLEY: I start running.

01:23:03.260 --> 01:23:03.866
TALIESIN: Yes, go, run.

01:23:03.866 --> 01:23:04.690
LIAM: Hustle, hustle.

01:23:04.690 --> 01:23:05.441
LAURA: Go, go, go.

01:23:05.441 --> 01:23:07.798
MATT: Okay. You all start running through. You're
running through with them and keeping

01:23:07.798 --> 01:23:08.796
concentration on your spell.

01:23:08.796 --> 01:23:09.859
ORION: Vax, check for traps!

01:23:09.859 --> 01:23:11.212
SAM: Vorak, Desona, come!

01:23:11.212 --> 01:23:13.580
LAURA: I perception-checked the room. It didn't
seem like there was anything.

01:23:13.580 --> 01:23:14.745
ORION: Oh, are we good? Okay.

01:23:14.745 --> 01:23:19.516
LIAM: I'm running ten feet ahead of everybody. I
rolled a big old one.

01:23:19.516 --> 01:23:21.041
(laughter)

01:23:21.041 --> 01:23:22.111
SAM: He tripped.

01:23:22.111 --> 01:23:23.410
MATT: Okay.

01:23:23.410 --> 01:23:24.793
MARISHA: Wow.

01:23:24.844 --> 01:23:32.137
MATT: You continue forward, and as you're rushing
through the group, not paying attention, you

01:23:32.194 --> 01:23:38.387
gently hit the edge of the mist barrier with your
shoulder, as you're rushing to the side

01:23:38.387 --> 01:23:42.077
instinctually to stealth along the wall. As your
shoulder breaks the mist--

01:23:42.123 --> 01:23:43.434
LIAM: Bring it.

01:23:43.434 --> 01:23:50.089
MATT: All of the dragon mouths burst into bright
fiery flame and begin spinning rapidly in the

01:23:50.089 --> 01:23:54.418
room. The people that are in the center running
through right now, which include Keyleth, Scanlan,

01:23:54.418 --> 01:23:58.239
Tiberius, and Pike, all of you guys make dexterity
saving throws.

01:23:58.239 --> 01:23:58.984
ASHLEY: What?!

01:23:58.984 --> 01:23:59.787
SAM: Whoa!

01:23:59.787 --> 01:24:00.682
MARISHA: Son of a bitch.

01:24:00.682 --> 01:24:01.354
LAURA: Vax!

01:24:01.354 --> 01:24:02.596
SAM: Way to go, Vax.

01:24:02.596 --> 01:24:04.533
TALIESIN: Teacher, teacher, did I have time to
finish my book?

01:24:04.533 --> 01:24:05.383
MATT: You have.

01:24:05.383 --> 01:24:06.185
TALIESIN: Yes!

01:24:06.185 --> 01:24:07.142
ASHLEY: Dexterity check?

01:24:07.142 --> 01:24:08.148
LIAM: You said dex save? Dex save?

01:24:08.148 --> 01:24:09.426
MATT: Dex save, yes.

01:24:09.426 --> 01:24:12.100
ORION: 18.

01:24:12.100 --> 01:24:13.391
MARISHA: It's all right.

01:24:13.391 --> 01:24:14.255
MATT: 18?

01:24:14.255 --> 01:24:15.319
ORION: Mm-hm.

01:24:15.319 --> 01:24:17.540
MATT: All right. Hmm. Scanlan?

01:24:17.540 --> 01:24:18.779
SAM: Oh! 13.

01:24:18.779 --> 01:24:19.727
MATT: 13.

01:24:19.727 --> 01:24:21.224
ASHLEY: Three.

01:24:21.224 --> 01:24:22.103
MATT: All right.

01:24:22.103 --> 01:24:23.558
LIAM: 26.

01:24:23.558 --> 01:24:24.804
MATT: All right.

01:24:24.804 --> 01:24:25.813
MARISHA: Also 13.

01:24:25.813 --> 01:24:27.288
ASHLEY: But I'm short! I'm so short. They would--

01:24:27.288 --> 01:24:28.329
LAURA: Super duper short.

01:24:28.329 --> 01:24:29.514
TRAVIS: Just going to hit you in the face.

01:24:29.514 --> 01:24:30.625
ASHLEY: They would just flow right over me.

01:24:30.625 --> 01:24:35.772
MATT: Okay. As the flames just burst out
throughout the room, tearing into the air with

01:24:35.772 --> 01:24:40.634
this reddish-white flame, both Vax and Tiberius
manage to try and dodge out of the way as best

01:24:40.634 --> 01:24:44.733
they can, only receiving, each of them--

01:24:44.733 --> 01:24:50.381
LAURA: Well, all Vax has to do is roll,
because he's already on the freaking ground.

01:24:50.535 --> 01:24:52.419
MATT: 12 points of fire damage to each of you.

01:24:52.419 --> 01:24:53.526
MARISHA: To who?

01:24:53.526 --> 01:24:56.077
LIAM: Well, rogue with Uncanny Dodge, for a
successful save gets zero damage.

01:24:56.077 --> 01:24:57.134
MATT: You take none.

01:24:57.134 --> 01:24:58.189
ORION: And I take half.

01:24:58.189 --> 01:24:59.408
MATT: So you take zero damage, you take 12.

01:24:59.408 --> 01:25:00.763
ORION: So I take half. Is it 24 total?

01:25:00.763 --> 01:25:02.300
MATT: No, 24 total. You take half.

01:25:02.300 --> 01:25:03.347
ORION: Oh.

01:25:03.347 --> 01:25:04.355
MARISHA: The rest of us?

01:25:04.355 --> 01:25:06.828
MATT: Scanlan, Keyleth, and Pike all take 24
points of fire damage.

01:25:06.878 --> 01:25:07.612
SAM: Ugh.

01:25:07.612 --> 01:25:08.738
ASHLEY: I got 24 points.

01:25:08.738 --> 01:25:09.792
MARISHA: Ouch.

01:25:09.792 --> 01:25:12.131
ORION: Oh! My robe.

01:25:12.131 --> 01:25:17.035
SAM: Ow. Are we still moving?

01:25:17.035 --> 01:25:18.104
LIAM: Tuck and roll.

01:25:18.104 --> 01:25:19.934
ORION: Are you getting used to your new foot,
Vax?

01:25:19.934 --> 01:25:22.578
LIAM: I'm back!

01:25:22.578 --> 01:25:29.297
MATT: You guys move through-- that's the four of
you guys. Percy, Grog, and Vex and Trinket are all

01:25:29.297 --> 01:25:34.876
behind, as they watch the flames burst out and
they all kind of stop their inertia, and now the

01:25:34.876 --> 01:25:36.441
mist slowly fills up the room.

01:25:36.441 --> 01:25:37.523
TRAVIS: Whoa.

01:25:37.523 --> 01:25:40.264
MATT: About the time that your spell wears off for
the first minute.

01:25:40.264 --> 01:25:43.202
MARISHA: Okay. (weak chuckle) Let's move?

01:25:43.202 --> 01:25:44.536
TRAVIS: It fills up the room?

01:25:44.536 --> 01:25:45.631
LAURA: We're still in the room.

01:25:45.631 --> 01:25:46.675
SAM: The three of us, you're still back.

01:25:46.675 --> 01:25:48.721
MATT: You guys are split right now, with the
bearers, the Scalebearers.

01:25:48.721 --> 01:25:50.992
LAURA: Oh, they're coming with us, they're like
coming with us through the whole thing?

01:25:50.992 --> 01:25:52.406
MATT: They're with you, yeah.

01:25:52.406 --> 01:25:53.369
MARISHA: Wait, hang on.

01:25:53.369 --> 01:25:56.761
LAURA: Keyleth, blow the smoke again. Blow the
mist away. If you can.

01:25:56.761 --> 01:25:59.365
MARISHA: Burning another spell slot. All right,
here we go.

01:25:59.365 --> 01:26:00.437
MATT: Oh, no.

01:26:00.437 --> 01:26:02.857
ASHLEY: We run through it.

01:26:02.857 --> 01:26:04.114
LAURA: And now we run.

01:26:04.114 --> 01:26:05.585
MARISHA: Oh, no. He doesn't care.

01:26:05.585 --> 01:26:06.389
TRAVIS: He doesn't care.

01:26:06.389 --> 01:26:07.790
TALIESIN: No, we walk gently through.

01:26:07.790 --> 01:26:11.793
MATT: Burning the second spell slot. (wind noise)
The mist clears itself. Now that you're aware of

01:26:11.793 --> 01:26:15.522
what it does, you're very careful to direct it
towards the center and leave an open path. The

01:26:15.522 --> 01:26:18.834
rest of you rush through, including the
Scalebearers, in the minute you have. The wind is

01:26:18.834 --> 01:26:22.174
blowing in your face from Keyleth's position. It's
kind of like stepping into the force of a

01:26:22.174 --> 01:26:24.578
hurricane. You have to put your hand in front of
you to see--

01:26:24.578 --> 01:26:26.577
LAURA: (shouts) Your breath smells pretty good,
though, Keyleth.

01:26:26.577 --> 01:26:29.362
MARISHA: Thanks, I tried to get a little of a sage
thing.

01:26:29.362 --> 01:26:31.163
ASHLEY: Sagey rosemary?

01:26:31.163 --> 01:26:32.277
TRAVIS: Very minty.

01:26:32.277 --> 01:26:34.018
MARISHA: A little orange blossom. It's nice.

01:26:34.018 --> 01:26:35.801
ORION: I'm going to Prestidigitate a tiny air
shield in front of me.

01:26:35.801 --> 01:26:37.962
LIAM: When I bite into a York Peppermint Patty--

01:26:37.962 --> 01:26:40.509
MARISHA: It's also pure oxygen, so we could get a
little buzz.

01:26:40.509 --> 01:26:42.577
MATT: It's a very, very tiny shield. It protects
this much of your face.

01:26:42.577 --> 01:26:43.615
ORION: That's what I'm doing.

01:26:43.615 --> 01:26:45.561
MATT: Your eyes are fine. The rest of your robes
are still (windblown cloth sounds).

01:26:45.561 --> 01:26:46.681
ORION: Yeah.

01:26:46.681 --> 01:26:49.359
MATT: You guys all make your way across the room.
You then finish your spell and the mist

01:26:49.359 --> 01:26:53.471
immediately fills up and completely obfuscates
that room behind you once more.

01:26:53.471 --> 01:26:54.784
SAM: One down!

01:26:54.784 --> 01:26:56.611
MARISHA: We made it!

01:26:56.611 --> 01:26:59.514
SAM: 20 rooms to go.

01:26:59.514 --> 01:27:05.700
MATT: You're now in what is a ten-foot-wide
chamber for an additional-- a tunnel or hallway--

01:27:05.700 --> 01:27:10.106
for another 20 feet before it opens up into
another room, but there is no light source in

01:27:10.106 --> 01:27:15.857
there whatsoever. You, with Light on your staff
again, you kind of step ahead to--

01:27:15.857 --> 01:27:17.732
LAURA: Do you want to shoot an arrow in?

01:27:17.732 --> 01:27:19.095
ORION: Oh, would you like to see?

01:27:19.095 --> 01:27:20.130
LAURA: Yeah, let's do it.

01:27:20.130 --> 01:27:21.711
ORION: Yeah, very good. Light.

01:27:21.711 --> 01:27:25.754
MATT: All right, so as Vex releases her arrow,
light bursts forth from the wooden shaft as it

01:27:25.754 --> 01:27:30.108
arcs across the room. As it does, you can see the
room. As compared to the previous one that was

01:27:30.108 --> 01:27:37.698
square in shape, this one is circular. It is
almost a cylinder in its design. Go ahead and make

01:27:37.698 --> 01:27:40.476
a perception check.

01:27:40.476 --> 01:27:44.376
LAURA: 16.

01:27:44.376 --> 01:27:46.046
MATT: Okay.

01:27:46.046 --> 01:27:47.700
LIAM: 29.

01:27:47.700 --> 01:27:49.184
LAURA: He's better.

01:27:49.184 --> 01:27:55.886
MATT: Okay. You notice that across this floor of
the circular room, there are these circles marked

01:27:55.886 --> 01:27:58.480
across the entirety of the surface here.

01:27:58.480 --> 01:28:02.265
LAURA: Great. Those are probably traps.

01:28:02.265 --> 01:28:04.383
TRAVIS: I bet those are fun.

01:28:04.383 --> 01:28:06.245
LAURA: Pressure plates, maybe?

01:28:06.245 --> 01:28:09.552
ORION: Okay, or sigils or-- maybe we have to
activate them or not activate them?

01:28:09.552 --> 01:28:11.413
TRAVIS: I have darkvision, now with a range of 60
feet.

01:28:11.466 --> 01:28:13.635
SAM: Can we see to the other side of the room?

01:28:13.635 --> 01:28:14.580
MATT: Hm?

01:28:14.580 --> 01:28:16.699
SAM: Can we see all the way to the other side of
the room?

01:28:16.907 --> 01:28:20.093
MATT: Opposite side, there is actually a much
larger opening and what looks to be another

01:28:20.093 --> 01:28:24.957
staircase that descends. This one is 20 feet wide.
It's a very wide staircase from what you're used

01:28:24.957 --> 01:28:26.699
to seeing, especially in these structures.

01:28:26.699 --> 01:28:27.924
SAM: And I'm hoping there's no door.

01:28:27.924 --> 01:28:30.459
MATT: No doorway. It's open. It just descends down
below. And the only way you can tell is that the

01:28:30.459 --> 01:28:31.766
arrow arcs across--

01:28:31.766 --> 01:28:33.269
LIAM: Everybody stand back.

01:28:33.269 --> 01:28:35.357
I'm going to click my Boots of Haste--

01:28:35.577 --> 01:28:39.473
LAURA: What? Shouldn't we throw something onto one
of the pressure plates first and see what it does?

01:28:39.525 --> 01:28:45.143
LIAM: Yeah, me. I'm going to click my Boots of
Haste, I'm going to run, I'm going to do a sort of

01:28:45.208 --> 01:28:53.202
a running roll, land on the closest circle and
wait for half a tick and then roll off of it.

01:28:53.202 --> 01:28:54.469
LAURA: Are you kidding me?!

01:28:54.469 --> 01:28:55.423
ORION: What are you doing?

01:28:55.423 --> 01:28:56.504
TRAVIS: No, no, let him do it! Let him do it.

01:28:56.504 --> 01:29:01.165
MATT: So as you guys are about to go, "Wait!", Vax is
already off. Clicks the boots. The arcane magic of

01:29:01.165 --> 01:29:04.051
the Boots of Haste kick into his body. He leaps
forward. Make an acrobatics check.

01:29:04.214 --> 01:29:08.520
LIAM: Okay. 22.

01:29:08.520 --> 01:29:10.521
TRAVIS: I hope you get your eyebrows burned off.

01:29:10.521 --> 01:29:14.594
MATT: All right. You leap forward. Your hand
touches the first circle in the room. As it does,

01:29:14.594 --> 01:29:20.337
there's suddenly a large shift in the room. All of
a sudden, the hand which you had purchase on

01:29:20.337 --> 01:29:25.125
slides out from underneath you. You catch yourself
on your feet, but now suddenly there's a loud

01:29:25.125 --> 01:29:31.034
grinding sound and the entire room seems to be
shifting, moving, spinning in its own right, and

01:29:31.034 --> 01:29:38.427
you instinctually feel something moving towards
you very quickly. Make a dexterity saving throw, Liam.

01:29:38.427 --> 01:29:39.626
SAM: Oh, boy.

01:29:39.626 --> 01:29:42.645
LAURA: Vax!

01:29:42.645 --> 01:29:44.893
ORION: I click my earring. You're an idiot, Vax.

01:29:44.893 --> 01:29:46.918
LIAM: I'm going to use Luck because that blew. And
that's a natural 20.

01:29:46.968 --> 01:29:48.559
SAM AND MARISHA: Oh!

01:29:48.559 --> 01:29:49.551
ASHLEY: Oh snap.

01:29:49.551 --> 01:29:50.653
ORION: Yeah, 20!

01:29:50.653 --> 01:29:51.726
ASHLEY: Yeah, 20.

01:29:51.726 --> 01:29:52.615
MARISHA: Yeah!

01:29:52.615 --> 01:29:57.304
MATT: So. You barely manage to move out of the
way before that circular portion of the ground

01:29:57.304 --> 01:30:02.981
skyrockets up like a pillar-- one very similar to
the one that you created for your spell-- slams

01:30:02.981 --> 01:30:09.320
into the ceiling with a heavy thud, retracts, and
continues again. In fact, looking around you, all

01:30:09.521 --> 01:30:13.464
of them in the room are now, at different levels,
pistoning into the ceiling. (repeated crashing

01:30:13.464 --> 01:30:19.483
rock noises) This entire room is slowly rotating
and there's just a series of pillars mashing into

01:30:19.483 --> 01:30:20.779
the ceiling.

01:30:20.779 --> 01:30:22.627
MARISHA: Oh, it's like a mini-game.

01:30:22.627 --> 01:30:25.069
MATT: You have to make an acrobatics check to try
and get through this now because you have very

01:30:25.069 --> 01:30:26.298
little space to move.

01:30:26.298 --> 01:30:27.710
LIAM: Okay.

01:30:27.710 --> 01:30:29.362
(laughter)

01:30:29.362 --> 01:30:31.321
LIAM: I'm going to use Luck again.

01:30:31.321 --> 01:30:32.623
MATT: (laughs)

01:30:32.623 --> 01:30:35.574
LIAM: That is 18.

01:30:35.574 --> 01:30:42.465
MATT: 18. You manage to make your way halfway
across the room, dodging out of the way as these

01:30:42.465 --> 01:30:46.853
pillars are slamming and retracting. Kind of use
the pattern of when they're pulling down from the

01:30:46.853 --> 01:30:51.778
ceiling, but they're moving very fast. One of them
manages to catch you underneath your ankle. Go

01:30:51.778 --> 01:30:54.536
ahead and make a dexterity saving throw again.

01:30:54.536 --> 01:31:00.381
LIAM: That is 15.

01:31:00.381 --> 01:31:03.455
MATT: 15. All right.

01:31:03.455 --> 01:31:04.935
TRAVIS: Uh-oh.

01:31:04.935 --> 01:31:07.265
ASHLEY: You're going to hurt your foot again,
Vax.

01:31:07.265 --> 01:31:10.460
MATT: It catches you, takes you off of your
balance, and it rockets you towards the ceiling.

01:31:10.460 --> 01:31:14.964
You manage to pull most of your body out of the
way in time, but it still catches the back of your

01:31:14.964 --> 01:31:20.171
shoulder blade. You take 40 points of crushing
damage.

01:31:20.171 --> 01:31:21.136
TRAVIS: Yes! (cackles)

01:31:21.136 --> 01:31:22.644
SAM: Ohhh!

01:31:22.644 --> 01:31:23.658
MARISHA: Holy shit.

01:31:23.658 --> 01:31:26.716
MATT: As you are slammed into the ceiling. And as
the pillar retracts, you roll off with a heavy

01:31:26.716 --> 01:31:32.784
wheeze of pain. (groan) Catching onto your feet
again. Make one more acrobatics check.

01:31:32.784 --> 01:31:35.779
MARISHA: Oh my god. If you get crushed to death--

01:31:35.779 --> 01:31:38.079
TRAVIS: (laughs) On Skype.

01:31:38.079 --> 01:31:39.451
LIAM: That's a 23.

01:31:39.451 --> 01:31:40.586
MATT: What was that?

01:31:40.586 --> 01:31:41.784
TRAVIS: 23.

01:31:41.784 --> 01:31:44.386
MATT: 23.

01:31:44.386 --> 01:31:46.195
LIAM: I'm like an acrobatic cheetah. 23.

01:31:46.195 --> 01:31:51.821
MATT: 23. You manage to-- in the severe pain
you're feeling, you can tell there's probably some

01:31:51.821 --> 01:31:55.673
serious bruising in there and you probably broke a
couple of ribs, but you manage to just barely

01:31:55.673 --> 01:31:59.591
dodge and leap out of the way, making your way
across the room to where the staircase descends,

01:31:59.591 --> 01:32:00.879
out of the immediate danger.

01:32:00.879 --> 01:32:01.820
SAM: Ah.

01:32:01.820 --> 01:32:02.724
LAURA: Jeez.

01:32:02.724 --> 01:32:05.949
MATT: The rest of you now are standing on the
opposite side of this room, which is currently a

01:32:05.949 --> 01:32:08.058
rotating grinding mill.

01:32:08.058 --> 01:32:09.683
TRAVIS: That was great.

01:32:09.683 --> 01:32:13.939
LIAM: I'd like to check if there's any kind of
device or anything on this side--

01:32:13.939 --> 01:32:19.632
ORION: Okay, hold on a second, Vax, just chill out
for a minute. We all just took a little damage

01:32:19.632 --> 01:32:20.733
this last time.

01:32:20.733 --> 01:32:22.243
LIAM: I'm just trying a perception check.

01:32:22.243 --> 01:32:23.165
SAM: He's checking. He's checking.

01:32:23.165 --> 01:32:24.254
MATT: All right, make a perception check.

01:32:24.254 --> 01:32:25.206
MARISHA: For a lever or something.

01:32:25.206 --> 01:32:26.120
TRAVIS: For a switch.

01:32:26.120 --> 01:32:26.926
LIAM: 25.

01:32:26.926 --> 01:32:27.871
SAM: 25.

01:32:27.871 --> 01:32:34.461
MATT: 25. You can see, in the ceiling, in the
very, very center of the room, precariously placed

01:32:34.461 --> 01:32:39.778
right where one of the pillars in the center slams
into the ceiling, there appears to be a small

01:32:39.778 --> 01:32:43.297
quarter-sized hole, gold piece-sized hole in the
ceiling.

01:32:43.297 --> 01:32:44.529
ASHLEY: Yeah, come on, Vex.

01:32:44.529 --> 01:32:46.916
TALIESIN: Race you for it.

01:32:46.916 --> 01:32:48.876
MATT: It's in the middle of the room.

01:32:48.876 --> 01:32:50.819
In the ceiling, where--

01:32:50.974 --> 01:32:53.923
LIAM: Is there a clear shot of it or is there
(bang bang bang) going on?

01:32:53.923 --> 01:32:58.549
MATT: Oh, no, it's still going. The pillars are
still slamming into the roof. And that one hole

01:32:58.549 --> 01:33:02.681
you see is right where one of the pillars slams
into the roof. You only see it intermittently when

01:33:02.681 --> 01:33:03.904
the pillar retracts.

01:33:03.904 --> 01:33:05.100
MARISHA: Go, sharpshooters, go.

01:33:05.100 --> 01:33:06.349
TALIESIN: You first, or me?

01:33:06.349 --> 01:33:09.410
LAURA: Well, let's try this first because you
might just break it down completely.

01:33:09.410 --> 01:33:10.610
TALIESIN: Oh, very well.

01:33:10.610 --> 01:33:12.942
LAURA: You are much more powerful than I am,
Percy.

01:33:12.942 --> 01:33:14.538
TRAVIS: Yeah, ladies first, perhaps.

01:33:14.538 --> 01:33:15.599
TALIESIN: Ladies first.

01:33:15.599 --> 01:33:17.690
LAURA: All right, can I try to shoot an arrow into
the little hole?

01:33:17.690 --> 01:33:23.369
MATT: You can. This is a hard shot because it's at
an angle now. We're talking, this is Robin

01:33:23.369 --> 01:33:27.079
Hood-level split-the-arrow. Because you have to
hit it and then ricochet upward to see if it'll

01:33:27.079 --> 01:33:28.003
have any effect.

01:33:28.003 --> 01:33:28.984
LAURA: Oh, jeez Louise.

01:33:28.984 --> 01:33:30.071
TRAVIS: Well, get up there.

01:33:30.071 --> 01:33:31.405
MARISHA: I place my hands on her shoulders--

01:33:31.405 --> 01:33:32.399
TRAVIS: Can you inspire?

01:33:32.399 --> 01:33:33.553
SAM: I can inspire her.

01:33:33.553 --> 01:33:35.445
MARISHA: And I give her Enhance Ability.

01:33:35.445 --> 01:33:36.590
SAM: Ooh, Enhance Ability.

01:33:36.590 --> 01:33:37.942
LAURA: Okay, what does that mean?

01:33:37.942 --> 01:33:41.979
MARISHA: You have advantage on-- oh, ability
checks. It's just ability checks.

01:33:41.979 --> 01:33:43.365
MATT: Ability checks. It's not going to help for
an attack.

01:33:43.365 --> 01:33:44.528
LAURA: This is, what, an attack?

01:33:44.528 --> 01:33:45.376
MARISHA: Never mind.

01:33:45.376 --> 01:33:46.490
MATT: This would be an attack.

01:33:46.490 --> 01:33:49.316
TRAVIS: I would like to offer my beard for a rub
of good luck.

01:33:49.316 --> 01:33:53.363
LAURA: Thanks, Grog.

01:33:53.363 --> 01:33:56.206
MATT: As you offer the beard, it tears off.

01:33:56.206 --> 01:33:57.093
TRAVIS: What?

01:33:57.093 --> 01:33:58.047
ASHLEY: Oh, no!

01:33:58.047 --> 01:33:59.409
TRAVIS: What did you do?!

01:33:59.409 --> 01:34:03.614
LAURA: You know what, I'm going to tie this to the
arrow. It's going to give it really good luck.

01:34:03.614 --> 01:34:05.699
SAM: That seems like it's aerodynamically--

01:34:05.699 --> 01:34:07.722
LAURA: I'm not actually going to tie it to the
arrow.

01:34:07.771 --> 01:34:08.877
TALIESIN: Okay!

01:34:08.877 --> 01:34:10.616
LAURA: I'm just going to tuck it--

01:34:10.616 --> 01:34:14.948
MATT: Mark in your inventory, you now have Fake
Grog Rope Beard.

01:34:14.948 --> 01:34:17.959
TRAVIS: Is that a -1 to my confidence now?

01:34:17.959 --> 01:34:20.773
MATT: (laughs) It will come into play.

01:34:20.773 --> 01:34:23.053
TRAVIS: (cries)

01:34:23.114 --> 01:34:27.501
ORION: So the goal is to shoot an arrow into
this-- like the Death Star?

01:34:27.580 --> 01:34:29.040
MATT: Essentially, yeah.

01:34:29.040 --> 01:34:30.054
LAURA: Yeah.

01:34:30.054 --> 01:34:35.063
ORION: Okay, cool. As I see her ready, I'm
going to hold up my hand with my ring and point it

01:34:35.227 --> 01:34:36.507
right at that hole.

01:34:36.507 --> 01:34:37.439
MATT: To do--

01:34:37.439 --> 01:34:38.650
LAURA: So you can deflect it if I--

01:34:38.650 --> 01:34:39.510
ORION: I got your back.

01:34:39.510 --> 01:34:40.518
LAURA: All right, thanks, Tiberius.

01:34:40.518 --> 01:34:41.413
ORION: Get it, Vex.

01:34:41.413 --> 01:34:42.357
MATT: All right, and you're going to--

01:34:42.357 --> 01:34:50.782
SAM: I'm going to inspire her. With inspiration.
I'll sing, (sings) Ooh ooh, shut up and shoot that

01:34:50.782 --> 01:34:54.548
hole! Your arrow is my destiny, yeah I said,

01:34:54.548 --> 01:35:00.361
ALL: (sings) Ooh ooh, shut up and shoot that hole!
(laughs)

01:35:00.361 --> 01:35:05.493
MATT: And with that, you feel your focus, you
wait, you breathe in, you breathe out, you breathe

01:35:05.493 --> 01:35:08.331
in, you breathe out in pattern with the slamming
of the piston against the ceiling.

01:35:08.331 --> 01:35:09.565
LAURA: Oh, I'm so nervous.

01:35:09.565 --> 01:35:11.068
ASHLEY: Get it, get it, get it, you're going to do
it.

01:35:11.068 --> 01:35:15.078
MATT: You let out all your breath and you hold,
hold, hold, waiting between heartbeats, and then

01:35:15.078 --> 01:35:17.899
(twwt), release. Go ahead and make your attack
roll.

01:35:17.899 --> 01:35:21.590
LAURA: I'm going to roll the fancy one we got last
week.

01:35:21.590 --> 01:35:23.239
LIAM: Get it, girl. Get it.

01:35:23.239 --> 01:35:28.108
LAURA: All right. (laughs) Oh, no. Okay. I add my
attack bonus?

01:35:28.108 --> 01:35:29.555
MATT: Yes, you do.

01:35:29.555 --> 01:35:30.920
SAM: Plus an inspiration.

01:35:30.920 --> 01:35:31.949
LAURA: Plus an inspiration dice?

01:35:31.949 --> 01:35:33.096
MATT: Plus a d10.

01:35:33.096 --> 01:35:35.389
ORION: Oh, shit.

01:35:35.389 --> 01:35:36.943
MARISHA: (whispering) It's so quiet.

01:35:36.943 --> 01:35:38.342
ORION: I know.

01:35:38.342 --> 01:35:43.584
LAURA: Oh, that's awesome! Okay. 35.

01:35:43.584 --> 01:35:45.531
(yelling)

01:35:45.531 --> 01:35:46.666
TRAVIS: Good inspiration.

01:35:46.666 --> 01:35:52.767
MATT: As you release the arrow, you see the
pillars slamming. The pillar comes down just as

01:35:52.767 --> 01:35:57.445
the arrow crests over it, past another pillar that
just barely manages to miss it by a segment.

01:35:57.445 --> 01:35:59.687
ORION: I cast Telekinesis to swoop it up.
(whoosh)

01:35:59.687 --> 01:36:00.962
SAM: Oh, god.

01:36:00.962 --> 01:36:02.066
ORION: Just to help and guide it.

01:36:02.066 --> 01:36:03.402
ASHLEY: No, but it's already gone in.

01:36:03.402 --> 01:36:04.350
TRAVIS: We don't need it! We don't need it!

01:36:04.350 --> 01:36:05.557
LAURA: Oh, let me just see if I got it first!

01:36:05.557 --> 01:36:06.921
LIAM: She rolled a 35, we don't need shit.

01:36:06.921 --> 01:36:09.519
ORION: It's going in there, anyway. I don't even
have to roll.

01:36:09.519 --> 01:36:16.111
MATT: So. As the pillar pulls down, the arrow goes
cascading forward. Go ahead and make a d20 roll

01:36:16.111 --> 01:36:18.476
with the +5 modifier.

01:36:18.476 --> 01:36:21.396
ORION: Sweet. That's 17.

01:36:21.396 --> 01:36:30.022
MATT: 17? Okay. So as the arrow makes its way, it
ricochets off the bottom edge of the actual hole

01:36:30.022 --> 01:36:35.276
and immediately bends itself upward, the shaft
bending. As it begins to start heading up the

01:36:35.276 --> 01:36:40.012
hole, there's a sudden force of arcane energy that
slams it even harder up into the top of this tiny

01:36:40.012 --> 01:36:41.239
little slit.

01:36:41.239 --> 01:36:42.325
TRAVIS: Yeah, good.

01:36:42.325 --> 01:36:46.934
MATT: As it goes up there, you hear what sounds
like a splintering of wood and metal. Then you

01:36:46.934 --> 01:36:53.957
hear metal grinding. You start seeing bits and
chunks of grinding metal begin to pour out of the

01:36:53.957 --> 01:36:57.688
hole and the pillars begin to (scraping stone).

01:36:57.688 --> 01:36:58.628
LAURA: Hey.

01:36:58.628 --> 01:36:59.564
ASHLEY: Yeah.

01:36:59.564 --> 01:37:00.712
TRAVIS: Nice shot!

01:37:00.712 --> 01:37:01.726
ASHLEY: Yeah, Vex!

01:37:01.726 --> 01:37:04.208
MATT: Eventually coming to a halt.

01:37:04.208 --> 01:37:06.062
MARISHA: A wrench in the machine.

01:37:06.062 --> 01:37:07.161
TALIESIN: I could have done it.

01:37:07.161 --> 01:37:08.122
LAURA: You totally could have done that.

01:37:08.122 --> 01:37:09.651
TALIESIN: I could have made that shot.

01:37:09.651 --> 01:37:10.698
SAM: Next room's yours.

01:37:10.698 --> 01:37:12.299
TALIESIN: Yes, next room, next room's all mine.

01:37:12.299 --> 01:37:13.674
ORION: That was one of those impossible things,
right?

01:37:13.674 --> 01:37:15.150
MATT: Pretty damn close to impossible.

01:37:15.150 --> 01:37:16.422
ORION: I knew it.

01:37:16.422 --> 01:37:17.395
LAURA: Nice.

01:37:17.395 --> 01:37:19.152
MARISHA: (laughs) Pretty damn close to
impossible.

01:37:19.152 --> 01:37:22.613
SAM: All right, let's go across and heal our
rogue.

01:37:22.613 --> 01:37:24.211
TRAVIS: Yeah, we walk across.

01:37:24.211 --> 01:37:26.240
LAURA: Yeah, all right.

01:37:26.240 --> 01:37:31.152
LIAM: As they come to the other side, I clutch my
broken rib and injuredly hold a hand up and give a

01:37:31.152 --> 01:37:34.623
half-assed high-five to my sister. (grunts)

01:37:34.623 --> 01:37:36.636
LAURA: Good job getting slammed into the roof like
that.

01:37:36.636 --> 01:37:37.743
LIAM: Yeah, you're welcome.

01:37:37.743 --> 01:37:38.666
LAURA: Yeah.

01:37:38.666 --> 01:37:39.701
MATT: All right.

01:37:39.701 --> 01:37:44.306
MARISHA: So can we take a short rest to heal up
and then also a short rest to take a short rest in

01:37:44.306 --> 01:37:45.463
real life?

01:37:45.463 --> 01:37:48.957
MATT: You can. We're going to go ahead and stop
here. You're now taking a short rest.

01:37:48.957 --> 01:37:50.014
LAURA: Okay.

01:37:50.014 --> 01:37:54.925
MATT: You guys take a moment. If you want to go
ahead and heal up using any of your hit dice,

01:37:54.925 --> 01:37:56.152
you're able to, Vax.

01:37:56.152 --> 01:37:57.233
MARISHA: I'm going to do that.

01:37:57.233 --> 01:37:58.242
SAM: Me, too.

01:37:58.242 --> 01:38:01.983
MATT: And on that note, we're going to go ahead
and take our five-minute break here, guys.

01:38:01.983 --> 01:38:02.805
TRAVIS: Cool.

01:38:02.805 --> 01:38:03.601
SAM: Five.

01:38:03.601 --> 01:38:05.909
MATT: While the party takes a short rest, we're
taking a five-minute rest. We've got to be done by

01:38:05.909 --> 01:38:07.731
ten tonight with the stream, so.

01:38:07.731 --> 01:38:08.685
SAM: Let's do it.

01:38:08.685 --> 01:38:09.550
LAURA: Woo.

01:38:09.550 --> 01:38:10.470
MATT: So we're going to take a five-minute break.

01:38:10.470 --> 01:38:11.302
SAM: True five. True five.

01:38:11.302 --> 01:38:13.144
MATT: Orion, if you want to go ahead and come
over, we're going to go ahead and give you guys--

01:38:13.144 --> 01:38:14.770
yes, sir?

01:38:14.770 --> 01:38:16.052
ZAC: Bring them on up.

01:38:16.052 --> 01:38:19.345
MATT: Okay, yeah, so we're going to go ahead and
introduce our guests and give them an overview of

01:38:19.345 --> 01:38:21.811
the charity that we have currently on the stream
tonight.

01:38:21.811 --> 01:38:23.203
TRAVIS: That was great work, though.

01:38:23.203 --> 01:38:24.114
LAURA: Yes.

01:38:24.114 --> 01:38:25.387
MARISHA: Oh my god, I rolled two eights in a row.

01:38:25.387 --> 01:38:26.088
TALIESIN: Nice!

01:38:26.088 --> 01:38:26.827
MARISHA: That's awesome.

01:38:26.827 --> 01:38:27.961
MATT: I'm going to pass this over to Orion.

01:38:27.961 --> 01:38:28.754
ORION: Okay.

01:38:28.754 --> 01:38:29.918
MATT: Come on over. Gonna enjoy my chickens.

01:38:29.918 --> 01:38:31.098
SAM: Don't forget to go to Teespring and buy our
T-shirts.

01:38:31.098 --> 01:38:32.839
LAURA: Oh, let-- no! We haven't even talked about
it at all!

01:38:32.839 --> 01:38:34.483
MATT: Yes! By the way, our T-shirts are on
Teespring. We'll have six more days.

01:38:34.483 --> 01:38:35.596
SAM: Six more days.

01:38:35.596 --> 01:38:42.085
MARISHA: They also just went up on our website, on
critrole.com. So you can go to our website and

01:38:42.085 --> 01:38:43.001
find the link.

01:38:43.001 --> 01:38:44.621
MATT: All right, guys, we'll see you in a little
bit. Meanwhile, take it away.

01:38:44.621 --> 01:38:46.855
SAM: I'm going to tweet the Teespring link right
now.

01:38:46.855 --> 01:38:48.320
ZAC: Lucas, go fullscreen.

01:38:48.320 --> 01:38:49.753
MARISHA: Sam is tweeting it.

01:38:49.753 --> 01:38:51.717
ORION: Give me that chair.

01:38:51.781 --> 01:38:54.892
ZAC: Cool. Are you good, man?

01:38:54.892 --> 01:38:55.923
ORION: Yeah.

01:38:55.923 --> 01:38:57.230
ZAC: Sweet.

01:38:57.230 --> 01:39:00.782
ORION: We had points. We had points. Are we
standing for this?

01:39:00.782 --> 01:39:02.487
TAYLOR: Yeah.

01:39:02.487 --> 01:39:12.075
ORION: Tell me that for the chat thing. Hi,
everybody! Orion Acaba here and Taylor Carol. This

01:39:12.075 --> 01:39:19.070
is our special guest. And he's with GameChanger,
and he has a couple of things to say for this

01:39:19.070 --> 01:39:24.781
particular awesome charity that we are working
with today with SquareEnix and the Deus Ex

01:39:24.797 --> 01:39:25.730
anniversary.

01:39:25.730 --> 01:39:26.646
TAYLOR: Yeah.

01:39:26.646 --> 01:39:29.023
MARISHA: Taylor!

01:39:29.023 --> 01:39:32.826
TAYLOR: Well, first of all, on behalf of
GameChanger, I just want to say what a blast it is

01:39:32.826 --> 01:39:38.393
to be with you guys. Personally, I've never
watched D&amp;D before. You guys have made me a huge fan.

01:39:38.393 --> 01:39:39.785
ORION: Yes.

01:39:39.785 --> 01:39:45.812
TAYLOR: And, yeah. So a little bit of backstory
about GameChanger. About nine years ago, I was

01:39:45.812 --> 01:39:51.462
diagnosed terminal form of cancer. I was given
about two weeks left to live, but thankfully it's

01:39:51.462 --> 01:39:54.061
been a long two weeks. I'm totally healthy now.

01:39:54.061 --> 01:39:56.803
(cheers)

01:39:56.803 --> 01:40:02.976
TAYLOR: Thank you. But when I was sick, the most
incredible thing that I saw was the impact that

01:40:02.976 --> 01:40:07.434
video games had on the people and on the children
that were fighting cancer and other rare diseases.

01:40:07.434 --> 01:40:14.614
And witnessing the incredible good of the game
community of video games. My dad and I resolved to

01:40:14.614 --> 01:40:20.617
make an organization that used and capitalized on that
incredible good of the video games, of the

01:40:20.776 --> 01:40:26.106
gaming community, to help those suffering from
rare diseases. And so one year later, GameChanger

01:40:26.304 --> 01:40:31.849
charity was born, and we started out just
collecting games from the incredible gaming

01:40:31.849 --> 01:40:37.696
community, giving them back to kids suffering from
rare diseases. And seven years later it evolved

01:40:37.696 --> 01:40:44.184
into what we have now. Now we're sponsored with
some incredible gaming organizations like Square.

01:40:44.184 --> 01:40:52.275
A huge thanks to them for partnering with us for
this awesome campaign. But yeah, today we go into

01:40:52.275 --> 01:40:58.289
hospitals and do things called GameChanger days
where we go and we bring food for the staff, for

01:40:58.289 --> 01:41:03.377
the families, for the kids suffering from rare
diseases. We bring them gaming packages so they

01:41:03.377 --> 01:41:07.854
can bond together. We provide college
scholarships, and we really just try and provide

01:41:07.854 --> 01:41:15.748
hope and inspiration-- the same hope and
inspiration that games really provided me when I

01:41:15.748 --> 01:41:17.010
was sick.

01:41:17.010 --> 01:41:20.411
ORION: Yeah. That's awesome. And we here at--

01:41:20.411 --> 01:41:22.698
TAYLOR: Oh, thank you. No, thank you guys.

01:41:22.698 --> 01:41:27.627
ORION: And we here at Critical Role really love
organizations like yours, which is why when we

01:41:27.627 --> 01:41:31.772
started talking, it was such a nice partnership
for you to come on and tell us about this

01:41:31.772 --> 01:41:38.947
organization. Tell everybody where they can find
to help, if they wanted to send to GameChanger.

01:41:38.947 --> 01:41:40.855
TAYLOR: Yeah, GameChanger. Yeah.

01:41:40.855 --> 01:41:43.071
ORION: Yeah, where would they go for that, to
check it out?

01:41:43.071 --> 01:41:46.716
TAYLOR: To support GameChanger, to learn more
about what we do, you can visit

01:41:46.716 --> 01:41:54.616
www.gamechangercharity.org, and if you go to our
website, you can see our campaign with Deus Ex.

01:41:54.616 --> 01:41:59.402
You can go online and if you donate anything more
than a dollar, you get a free copy, a director's cut--

01:41:59.402 --> 01:42:03.806
ORION: Oh! Well, awesome. That's cool.
I'll probably do that too.

01:42:03.806 --> 01:42:10.935
It sounds like it's pretty sweet. And I
want to thank you, the rest, with all of us. I'm

01:42:10.999 --> 01:42:19.972
doing this because I'm currently fighting cancer.
I have-- I don't have that bad of a trek to go

01:42:19.972 --> 01:42:27.946
through, but it is very inconvenient and painful,
but hearing stories like you. I mean, you're

01:42:27.946 --> 01:42:34.586
20. He has a beautiful singing voice. He's a
singer. And you're going to Harvard, is that

01:42:34.661 --> 01:42:35.586
what's going on?

01:42:35.586 --> 01:42:36.896
TAYLOR: I am, yeah, I'm a rising junior.

01:42:36.896 --> 01:42:38.403
ORION: Stupid doctors, they don't know shit.

01:42:38.403 --> 01:42:49.349
But people like you inspire me, because up
until a few months ago, I didn't need any of that

01:42:49.349 --> 01:42:54.316
kind of inspiration. So it's great, and your
organization's great, so we just wanted to thank

01:42:54.316 --> 01:42:58.230
you for coming on and speaking with everybody and
letting everybody know, and we'll be working

01:42:58.230 --> 01:43:04.187
together in the future, too, and we'll be doing
lots of fun stuff, so yeah. Check these guys out, please.

01:43:04.187 --> 01:43:05.343
LAURA: Donate, donate.

01:43:05.343 --> 01:43:07.242
ASHLEY: What are you studying at Harvard?

01:43:07.242 --> 01:43:08.715
TAYLOR: I am an English concentrator.

01:43:08.715 --> 01:43:09.992
ORION: Whoa.

01:43:09.992 --> 01:43:10.939
MARISHA: Nice.

01:43:10.939 --> 01:43:11.861
TAYLOR: Yeah, yeah.

01:43:11.861 --> 01:43:12.973
LAURA: I don't even know what that means.

01:43:12.973 --> 01:43:14.881
ORION: Hold on a second. Do you mean like you
concentrate on English?

01:43:14.881 --> 01:43:16.738
TAYLOR: (English accent) English primarily.

01:43:16.738 --> 01:43:19.182
ORION: Oh, very good. Okay, cool.

01:43:19.182 --> 01:43:20.659
That's like my second language.

01:43:20.659 --> 01:43:23.444
TAYLOR: You guys have to teach me better accents.
I love all of your accents.

01:43:23.444 --> 01:43:29.741
ORION: (laughs) Any other questions for our guest,
guys?

01:43:29.741 --> 01:43:34.547
ZAC: I'd like to let everybody know, the mods all
have access to the GameChanger command in the

01:43:34.547 --> 01:43:38.187
chatroom, so if you guys are watching and are not
in the chat, just join the chat really quick and

01:43:38.187 --> 01:43:43.511
you guys will be able to get that link for the
donation link to get Deus Ex and anything over a

01:43:43.511 --> 01:43:46.814
dollar and you get a copy of the game. We're going
to go ahead and let that run all the way

01:43:46.814 --> 01:43:50.947
throughout the rebroadcast and throughout the
weekend, so mods, just keep spamming that

01:43:50.947 --> 01:43:51.984
throughout the chat.

01:43:51.984 --> 01:43:54.228
LAURA: So donations tonight are going to
GameChanger, yeah?

01:43:54.228 --> 01:43:55.276
ORION: Yeah.

01:43:55.276 --> 01:44:01.528
ZAC: It's up to you guys whether or not you want
826LA to go to GameChanger because the link right

01:44:01.528 --> 01:44:04.063
now just goes to Critical Role, so it's up to you
guys for where it goes from there.

01:44:04.063 --> 01:44:05.044
ORION: So we can do that.

01:44:05.044 --> 01:44:07.251
LAURA: Awesome. I think donations tonight will
definitely go to GameChanger, yeah.

01:44:07.251 --> 01:44:09.190
ORION: Yeah, so that's what we'll do. Awesome!

01:44:09.190 --> 01:44:10.169
TAYLOR: Thank you all.

01:44:10.169 --> 01:44:11.101
ORION: Right now. That's the decision.

01:44:11.101 --> 01:44:11.915
TAYLOR: Go team.

01:44:11.915 --> 01:44:12.842
MARISHA: Tell them it's the last day.

01:44:12.842 --> 01:44:14.139
ORION: And this is our last day. Is that right?

01:44:14.139 --> 01:44:15.927
TAYLOR: Yes, so this is the last day to get your
copy--

01:44:15.927 --> 01:44:17.148
ORION: For the Deus Ex thing.

01:44:17.148 --> 01:44:18.701
ZAC: Okay, then I will not let it run over the
weekend.

01:44:18.701 --> 01:44:22.496
ORION: Yeah. But again, dude, thank you for coming
on.

01:44:22.496 --> 01:44:23.607
TAYLOR: Hey, thank you.

01:44:23.607 --> 01:44:27.548
ORION: And we'll break because I have to pee
really bad. But thank you so much.

01:44:27.548 --> 01:44:29.019
TAYLOR: Thank you.

01:44:29.019 --> 01:44:36.909
ZAC: So guys, just to be clear, all of your
donations tonight will go towards GameChanger, but

01:44:36.909 --> 01:44:41.761
if you want a copy of the game, just go and donate
a dollar on the link that we have access to in the

01:44:41.761 --> 01:44:45.674
chatroom. And just so you guys know, there will
not be time for them to read messages tonight

01:44:45.674 --> 01:44:52.039
after the show. Lucas and I both have to catch a
flight, so sorry. We'll get to them next time.

01:44:52.039 --> 01:44:54.508
TAYLOR: Anything more than a dollar.

01:44:54.508 --> 01:44:57.333
ZAC: Anything more than a dollar, to be clear.
Anything more than a dollar.

01:44:57.333 --> 01:44:59.486
ASHLEY: Go donate. Just do it!

01:44:59.486 --> 01:45:03.910
ZAC: Listen to Ashley. We're also really close to
another giveaway, guys. If you guys subscribe, I

01:45:03.910 --> 01:45:09.461
think we're only like ten away from another
giveaway, a large giveaway, which is a signed

01:45:09.461 --> 01:45:14.502
Player's Handbook and a signed photo of the cast.
And every 50 we'll do a giveaway until the show's

01:45:14.502 --> 01:45:19.871
over tonight. We will not be going late, so just
keep in mind, guys, don't send Geek &amp; Sundry

01:45:19.871 --> 01:45:24.698
messages upset that your message wasn't read.
We'll get to it next time. We appreciate you guys

01:45:24.698 --> 01:45:30.528
donating and Lucas, go ahead and go to drop cam.
Yeah, go drop cam.

01:45:30.528 --> 01:56:09.616
[break]

01:56:09.691 --> 01:56:10.753
MATT: Welcome back.

01:56:10.753 --> 01:56:13.371
ZAC: I had a really quick announcement before we
get back into the game. The winner is Paula

01:56:13.371 --> 01:56:15.131
Konito, so congratulations--

01:56:15.131 --> 01:56:16.066
MARISHA: Paula Konito!

01:56:16.066 --> 01:56:17.171
MATT: Paula Konito, congrats!

01:56:17.171 --> 01:56:18.404
MARISHA: Paula Konito!

01:56:18.404 --> 01:56:21.457
ZAC: -- and I understand that we crashed their
website for donations--

01:56:21.457 --> 01:56:22.679
MATT: (laughs)

01:56:22.679 --> 01:56:23.528
ASHLEY: What?

01:56:23.528 --> 01:56:27.730
ZAC: So congratulations, guys, for crashing the
website, but what is not crashed is our donation

01:56:27.730 --> 01:56:32.705
link, so if you scroll down and click on the 826LA
link, all of the donations that are made tonight

01:56:32.705 --> 01:56:34.747
they've said will go to GameChanger

01:56:34.747 --> 01:56:37.440
LAURA: Yeah, the portion of the donations that
would normally go to 826LA tonight are going to go

01:56:37.440 --> 01:56:38.509
to GameChanger.

01:56:38.509 --> 01:56:42.368
ZAC: So just scroll down on the channel page,
click on 826LA or the donate link that's being

01:56:42.368 --> 01:56:46.930
spammed in the chat room, and all of those
donations will go to GameChanger. And they let us

01:56:46.930 --> 01:56:51.113
know before they left, they just got 10,000 more
Deus Ex keys, so we will let that run throughout

01:56:51.113 --> 01:56:52.063
the weekend.

01:56:52.063 --> 01:56:52.975
TRAVIS: That's amazing.

01:56:52.975 --> 01:56:53.937
LAURA: Oh, awesome.

01:56:53.937 --> 01:56:54.897
ORION: Nice!

01:56:54.897 --> 01:56:57.501
ZAC: So the mods will keep spamming that
throughout the weekend and you guys can donate

01:56:57.557 --> 01:57:00.687
throughout the rebroadcast and things like that
for a one-dollar Deus Ex code.

01:57:00.687 --> 01:57:01.720
LAURA: Anything over a dollar.

01:57:01.720 --> 01:57:02.750
ZAC: Anything over a dollar, yeah.

01:57:02.750 --> 01:57:03.693
MATT: That's so awesome.

01:57:03.693 --> 01:57:04.940
ZAC: One-oh-one! Enjoy Deus Ex.

01:57:04.940 --> 01:57:06.062
MATT: Yeah! Thank you guys so much.

01:57:06.062 --> 01:57:07.511
LAURA: It would be good if you donated more than
one dollar, if you want.

01:57:07.511 --> 01:57:09.118
TALIESIN: It's still needed.

01:57:09.118 --> 01:57:10.839
MATT: The Critters are strong. The Critters are
legion.

01:57:10.839 --> 01:57:11.798
TRAVIS: It is. They are.

01:57:11.798 --> 01:57:12.841
MATT: It's amazing the things we can do.

01:57:12.841 --> 01:57:14.287
ORION: It is on. YES.

01:57:14.287 --> 01:57:15.742
TALIESIN: There are Critters in the walls.

01:57:15.742 --> 01:57:16.800
MARISHA: They're in the god--

01:57:16.800 --> 01:57:18.714
MARISHA AND TALIESIN: -- damn walls!

01:57:18.714 --> 01:57:20.279
TALIESIN: Thank you for being there with me on
that.

01:57:20.279 --> 01:57:22.002
MATT: All righty, so! Back into the fray.

01:57:22.002 --> 01:57:23.075
LAURA: Oh, god, okay.

01:57:23.075 --> 01:57:27.844
MATT: You guys, after finishing your short rest,
healing up various wounds in that circumstance--

01:57:27.844 --> 01:57:30.042
SAM: (plays note on flute)

01:57:30.042 --> 01:57:31.835
(laughter)

01:57:31.835 --> 01:57:34.910
MATT: You make your way, playing a fancy little
ditty on the flute. You make your way down this

01:57:34.910 --> 01:57:43.252
long, long staircase. You continue down for, I'd
say, probably a good hundred feet or so before you

01:57:43.252 --> 01:57:49.990
start encountering, I'll say, a mild change in the
scenery, at least. What was normally just a musty

01:57:49.990 --> 01:57:55.505
hallway is becoming thicker and thicker coated
with large spiderwebs.

01:57:55.505 --> 01:57:56.808
LAURA: Ugh.

01:57:56.808 --> 01:57:57.966
TRAVIS: Awesome.

01:57:57.966 --> 01:57:59.332
ORION: Everything's so sticky.

01:57:59.332 --> 01:58:00.473
ASHLEY: Spiders!

01:58:00.473 --> 01:58:04.811
MATT: You manage to push through and cut through,
but it gets to the point where it's just so matted

01:58:04.811 --> 01:58:09.935
you guys are having to bushwhack your way through
as if you had a machete.

01:58:09.935 --> 01:58:12.085
TALIESIN: I'm not taking off my mask.

01:58:12.085 --> 01:58:18.445
TRAVIS: Can I turn to one of those (clears throat)
Scalebearers and ask if they've ever dealt with

01:58:18.445 --> 01:58:21.127
any umber-hulks in this region.

01:58:21.127 --> 01:58:30.382
MATT: Scalebearer Vorak gives kind of a curious
look to your question. Scalebearer Desona looks to

01:58:30.382 --> 01:58:38.068
you and says, "No, I don't believe they exist in
this region. Nor this close to the surface, as far

01:58:38.068 --> 01:58:39.543
"as I know."

01:58:39.543 --> 01:58:42.648
TRAVIS: Right. That's important, isn't it.

01:58:42.648 --> 01:58:47.656
ORION: Are the spiderwebs-- are they becoming more
as we traverse--

01:58:47.656 --> 01:58:49.056
MATT: Yes, they're getting thicker and thicker.

01:58:49.056 --> 01:58:52.339
ORION: Okay, so I'm going to make my way towards
the front of the group because I'm noticing this

01:58:52.339 --> 01:59:00.270
and I'm going to do a Fire Breath, and I'm going
to instantly cast Control Flame and catch as much

01:59:00.270 --> 01:59:03.590
as I can of it, and start spinning it, burning the
webs as we go.

01:59:03.590 --> 01:59:11.154
MATT: Okay. Very cool. So, Tiberius steps forward
and breathes a heating breath of dragon fire out

01:59:11.154 --> 01:59:17.157
of his mouth. As it cascades forward, burning
through the nearby webs, he casts a secondary

01:59:17.157 --> 01:59:21.859
spell and captures it and begins to shape it,
almost like it's a fiery clay in the middle of the

01:59:21.859 --> 01:59:26.283
air. And he utilizes it in a very similar way to
how he uses Telekinesis and begins to use that

01:59:26.283 --> 01:59:29.684
rolling fire to burn through the webbing as you
guys continue down the stairway.

01:59:29.738 --> 01:59:30.471
LAURA: Nice.

01:59:30.471 --> 01:59:31.748
TALIESIN: That's convenient.

01:59:31.748 --> 01:59:33.161
MARISHA: At least it'll be disinfected.

01:59:33.161 --> 01:59:34.974
ORION: Mm-hm-hm. Fire cleans all.

01:59:34.974 --> 01:59:40.722
MATT: It also leaves a terrible stench. Burning
web has this awful kind of--

01:59:40.777 --> 01:59:42.157
TRAVIS: Burnt hair?

01:59:42.157 --> 01:59:46.793
MATT: It's similar. Burnt hair with burnt plastic,
if you can think of it-- it's awful.

01:59:46.793 --> 01:59:48.850
LAURA: What's plastic?

01:59:48.850 --> 01:59:53.520
MATT: This is more for your own player knowledge,
sensory knowledge.

01:59:53.520 --> 01:59:56.077
(laughter)

01:59:56.077 --> 02:00:00.678
MATT: The sound of crackling of the nearby webbing
that's slowly retracting and burning and melting

02:00:00.678 --> 02:00:05.907
is immediately joined by the sound of a low
clicking.

02:00:06.065 --> 02:00:08.731
(groaning)

02:00:08.731 --> 02:00:10.921
LAURA: I stealth immediately.

02:00:10.921 --> 02:00:16.513
MARISHA: Oh, that frickin' sound. Do we-- I can
try to cast Pass Without a Trace on all of us, if

02:00:16.513 --> 02:00:18.031
we want to sneak through here.

02:00:18.031 --> 02:00:19.168
LAURA: Oh, yeah, that would be good!

02:00:19.168 --> 02:00:20.267
MARISHA: Do you want to try to sneak through?

02:00:20.267 --> 02:00:21.056
TRAVIS: Yeah, do it.

02:00:21.056 --> 02:00:22.419
MARISHA: I cast Pass Without a Trace.

02:00:22.419 --> 02:00:23.758
TRAVIS: Now let's vogue.

02:00:23.758 --> 02:00:26.294
This changes every time!

02:00:26.300 --> 02:00:27.486
ORION: Sweet!

02:00:27.486 --> 02:00:30.577
MATT: All right, so Pass Without a Trace is cast,
while you two both make stealth rolls.

02:00:30.577 --> 02:00:32.103
LAURA: So, with the Pass Without a Trace?

02:00:32.103 --> 02:00:33.232
MATT: With the Pass Without a Trace, yes.

02:00:33.232 --> 02:00:34.361
LAURA: 31.

02:00:34.361 --> 02:00:35.659
ORION: (quietly, to Marisha) Is my magic on
stealth, too?

02:00:35.659 --> 02:00:36.585
LIAM: 24.

02:00:36.585 --> 02:00:37.853
MATT: With the plus ten?

02:00:37.853 --> 02:00:39.212
LIAM: Plus ten from what? Say again?

02:00:39.212 --> 02:00:40.197
LAURA: Pass Without a Trace.

02:00:40.197 --> 02:00:41.214
MATT: Keyleth cast Pass Without a Trace.

02:00:41.214 --> 02:00:42.454
LIAM: Oh, 34.

02:00:42.454 --> 02:00:47.559
MATT: All right. You guys dart off to the side,
kind of using the remnants of the web to block

02:00:47.559 --> 02:00:55.902
your physical forms. The boiling fire that has
been placed ahead of you is starting to reflect

02:00:55.902 --> 02:01:01.708
small little points of reflected light throughout
the shadows in the distance that are moving

02:01:01.708 --> 02:01:06.647
towards you as you see giant hairy arachnid legs.

02:01:06.647 --> 02:01:17.516
ORION: I back up! I have my cloak on. And I'm
going to go ahead and cast Stoneskin. That's what

02:01:17.516 --> 02:01:19.185
I do right now.

02:01:19.185 --> 02:01:22.626
MATT: You cast Stoneskin? I'm going to go
ahead and ask--

02:01:22.626 --> 02:01:26.655
MARISHA: I'm also going to cast Stoneskin.

02:01:26.706 --> 02:01:32.942
LAURA: Can I cast, while they're coming-- where
did I write it down?

02:01:32.942 --> 02:01:35.156
SAM: I'm going to go invisible.

02:01:35.156 --> 02:01:39.027
LAURA: Never mind, I can't find my spell.

02:01:53.945 --> 02:01:57.481
SAM: This is exciting, guys. There's a board
of some sort.

02:01:57.549 --> 02:02:00.548
LAURA: I cast Entangle on the ground.

02:02:00.548 --> 02:02:02.383
MATT: In front?

02:02:02.383 --> 02:02:03.835
LAURA: Yeah.

02:02:03.835 --> 02:02:06.212
SAM: You have-- you can cast things?

02:02:06.212 --> 02:02:07.446
LAURA: (quickly) Yeah, yeah, yeah!

02:02:07.446 --> 02:02:09.465
ORION: (quietly) Yeah, she's a ranger, she can
cast stuff.

02:02:09.465 --> 02:02:10.613
TRAVIS: Apparently.

02:02:10.613 --> 02:02:12.077
TALIESIN: As long as it's at range.

02:02:12.077 --> 02:02:13.462
SAM: Grog, you've got a beard spell.

02:02:13.462 --> 02:02:14.451
TRAVIS: I do.

02:02:14.451 --> 02:02:16.547
TALIESIN: That was my terrible joke and I wish I
hadn't. Now I'm embarrassed.

02:02:16.547 --> 02:02:18.488
TRAVIS: I can also cast Flatulence.

02:02:18.488 --> 02:02:21.997
SAM: And you have Frenzied Rage.

02:02:22.047 --> 02:02:31.479
MATT: All right. You can now see skittering off to
the side what appear to be a series of large

02:02:31.479 --> 02:02:36.364
arachnid-like creatures. As you cast Entanglement,
you can--

02:02:36.364 --> 02:02:37.994
LAURA: I'm reading it now.

02:02:37.994 --> 02:02:40.130
MATT: Go ahead and read the spell.

02:02:40.297 --> 02:02:44.141
ORION: Did I manage to catch with the Control
Flame my entire Fire Breath when I did that? And

02:02:44.141 --> 02:02:45.652
I'm controlling it still?

02:02:45.652 --> 02:02:46.867
MATT: Currently you are.

02:02:46.867 --> 02:02:49.952
LAURA: Oh, that's not what it was. That's the
wrong spell. Sorry, sorry, it's Spike Growth, is

02:02:49.952 --> 02:02:51.125
the spell.

02:02:51.125 --> 02:02:52.496
SAM: Spikes growth?

02:02:52.496 --> 02:02:55.457
LAURA: I cast Spike Growth.

02:02:55.457 --> 02:02:57.371
MATT: Spike Growth, okay, that is different.

02:02:57.371 --> 02:03:03.521
LAURA: Yes, which is-- the ground in a 20-foot
radius centered on a point within range twists and

02:03:03.521 --> 02:03:10.120
sprouts hard spikes and thorns. It's difficult
terrain for the duration, but anybody that can see

02:03:10.120 --> 02:03:14.895
me casting it doesn't take damage to it, it's only
the people that don't see me casting it.

02:03:14.895 --> 02:03:16.349
MARISHA: Dope.

02:03:16.349 --> 02:03:18.104
SAM: Really?

02:03:18.104 --> 02:03:19.705
MATT: All right.

02:03:19.705 --> 02:03:23.314
LAURA: Yeah. Any creature that can't see the area
at the time the spell is cast must make a wisdom check.

02:03:23.314 --> 02:03:24.520
ORION: Cool.

02:03:24.520 --> 02:03:26.188
SAM: All right, but can they see the area?

02:03:26.188 --> 02:03:28.329
MATT: They can see the area.

02:03:28.329 --> 02:03:34.628
LAURA: Oh. Well, that's not quite the same thing,
then, what I saw. (yells) Forget it, my spell is stupid!

02:03:34.628 --> 02:03:35.554
SAM: No, no!

02:03:35.554 --> 02:03:36.812
ORION: It's fine, just not in a hallway with
stairs.

02:03:36.812 --> 02:03:37.697
LAURA: I know!

02:03:37.697 --> 02:03:39.558
SAM: It's fine, just stick to arrows, really.

02:03:39.558 --> 02:03:43.853
ASHLEY: She can do so much more than just arrows!

02:03:43.853 --> 02:03:49.208
ORION: As I see this, can I release my Control
Flame and let the Fire Breath just happen, and not

02:03:49.208 --> 02:03:50.371
control it anymore?

02:03:50.371 --> 02:03:56.708
MATT: Looking into your spell now. Oh, Control Flames
is a cantrip. You are able to control just enough

02:03:56.879 --> 02:04:01.010
fire to burn away the things. It wouldn't actually
do any damage if released. Control Fire kind of

02:04:01.010 --> 02:04:03.014
like captures an element of it.

02:04:03.014 --> 02:04:05.741
ORION: Okay. So that's what I was using, the
element of what I did.

02:04:05.741 --> 02:04:06.596
MATT: Yeah.

02:04:06.596 --> 02:04:07.832
ORION: So I used it so I could have the fire.

02:04:07.832 --> 02:04:08.595
MATT: Exactly.

02:04:08.595 --> 02:04:09.358
ORION: Got it.

02:04:09.358 --> 02:04:11.169
MATT: You set it as a catalyst to it.

02:04:11.169 --> 02:04:14.170
LAURA: They can see the ground.

02:04:14.170 --> 02:04:16.019
MATT: They can.

02:04:16.019 --> 02:04:18.472
LAURA: Then no, don't cast it.

02:04:18.628 --> 02:04:20.705
TRAVIS: Doesn't it mess up the ground if we try to
walk through it?

02:04:20.705 --> 02:04:22.068
LAURA: Not you guys, but they--

02:04:22.068 --> 02:04:25.842
MARISHA: But they're spiders. They're probably not
that wise.

02:04:25.842 --> 02:04:27.278
ORION: Can I cast something else?

02:04:27.278 --> 02:04:28.438
MATT: No. Right now everyone rolls initiative.

02:04:28.438 --> 02:04:29.581
ORION: Damn it!

02:04:29.581 --> 02:04:31.588
ASHLEY: Ugh.

02:04:31.588 --> 02:04:32.977
MATT: There are only so many things you can do
here, Tiberius.

02:04:32.977 --> 02:04:34.447
ORION: I know, but I like doing lots of things.

02:04:34.447 --> 02:04:35.375
MATT: I know you do.

02:04:35.375 --> 02:04:37.037
MARISHA: That's not bad! I'll take that.

02:04:37.037 --> 02:04:38.099
SAM: I lost my dice.

02:04:38.099 --> 02:04:38.990
LAURA: That's my punishment.

02:04:38.990 --> 02:04:40.095
TRAVIS: Fuck, yeah.

02:04:40.095 --> 02:04:41.239
TALIESIN: I love my new stats.

02:04:41.239 --> 02:04:42.509
LAURA: I don't think that should count.

02:04:42.509 --> 02:04:45.131
TALIESIN: I rolled terribly this time but my stats
are good.

02:04:45.131 --> 02:04:46.585
SAM: Every time, every time.

02:04:46.585 --> 02:04:48.000
ORION: What?

02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:51.709
SAM: I've never rolled a double digit initiative
roll, ever.

02:04:51.709 --> 02:04:53.949
MATT: Oh, Scanlan, but you roll when it
counts.

02:04:53.949 --> 02:04:56.733
TRAVIS: Just Wil Wheaton roll every time you do
initiative.

02:04:56.786 --> 02:04:58.165
TALIESIN: Is that what we're calling it?
Wheatoning?

02:04:58.165 --> 02:04:59.129
TRAVIS: Yeah, Wheatoning.

02:04:59.129 --> 02:05:00.196
LAURA: Wheatoning? Yeah.

02:05:00.196 --> 02:05:00.952
TALIESIN: All right.

02:05:00.952 --> 02:05:01.840
TRAVIS: Wheatoning.

02:05:01.840 --> 02:05:03.419
SAM: (announcer voice) Wha-Wha-Wheaton.

02:05:03.419 --> 02:05:04.692
MATT: All right, so. 25-20.

02:05:04.692 --> 02:05:05.805
ASHLEY: Natural 20.

02:05:05.805 --> 02:05:07.342
(yelling)

02:05:07.342 --> 02:05:09.354
ASHLEY: I don't think that ever happens when it's
like damage or something.

02:05:09.354 --> 02:05:10.684
MATT: That's okay.

02:05:10.684 --> 02:05:11.777
LAURA: 23.

02:05:11.777 --> 02:05:12.759
ASHLEY: I'm gonna go with it.

02:05:12.759 --> 02:05:13.811
MATT: Okay, so 23. Grog, what have you got?

02:05:13.811 --> 02:05:14.811
TRAVIS: 21.

02:05:14.811 --> 02:05:22.469
MATT: Okay, so we've got Vex, Grog, and Pike,
what's your dex? What's your initiative bonus?

02:05:22.469 --> 02:05:23.836
ASHLEY: Nothing.

02:05:23.836 --> 02:05:26.906
MATT: Nothing, so 20. All right. 20 to 15?

02:05:26.906 --> 02:05:28.116
MARISHA: 17.

02:05:28.116 --> 02:05:29.322
MATT: 17, Keyleth.

02:05:29.322 --> 02:05:30.269
ORION: 15.

02:05:30.269 --> 02:05:31.345
TALIESIN: 16.

02:05:31.345 --> 02:05:40.010
MATT: All right, Percy. Tiberius. Vax?

02:05:40.010 --> 02:05:42.030
LAURA: He's gone.

02:05:42.030 --> 02:05:43.483
MATT: Has left the screen.

02:05:43.483 --> 02:05:44.526
TRAVIS: Oh, really?

02:05:44.526 --> 02:05:45.530
SAM: Great.

02:05:45.530 --> 02:05:46.619
ASHLEY: Last.

02:05:46.619 --> 02:05:48.070
MATT: I'm going to consider that a low
initiative.

02:05:48.070 --> 02:05:49.195
MARISHA: Oh-ho-ho-ho.

02:05:49.195 --> 02:05:50.306
ORION: He just went to go poop.

02:05:50.306 --> 02:05:51.818
SAM: Seven!

02:05:51.857 --> 02:05:53.097
MATT: Seven for Scanlan.

02:05:53.097 --> 02:05:53.963
ORION: Or deal with--

02:05:53.963 --> 02:05:55.470
MATT: All right, we'll get to his turn when we get
to it.

02:05:55.470 --> 02:05:56.412
ASHLEY: (yells) Vax!

02:05:56.412 --> 02:05:57.562
MATT: It's okay. All right, Vex.

02:05:57.562 --> 02:05:58.529
MARISHA: Wait, there he is.

02:05:58.529 --> 02:05:59.559
SAM: He's holding a cat.

02:05:59.559 --> 02:06:01.214
ORION: He has a cat.

02:06:01.277 --> 02:06:03.502
SAM: It's Trinket! It's Trinket!

02:06:03.502 --> 02:06:05.446
MATT: What did you roll for initiative?

02:06:05.446 --> 02:06:06.524
LIAM: That is a 16.

02:06:06.524 --> 02:06:07.551
MATT: 16?

02:06:07.551 --> 02:06:08.334
ORION: Okay.

02:06:08.334 --> 02:06:09.676
TRAVIS: Get your head out of your ass.

02:06:09.676 --> 02:06:10.899
SAM: He's Dr. Evil.

02:06:10.899 --> 02:06:12.552
(laughter)

02:06:12.552 --> 02:06:13.153
MATT: All right, Vex.

02:06:13.153 --> 02:06:14.021
LAURA: Me?

02:06:14.021 --> 02:06:15.327
MATT: Yes.

02:06:15.393 --> 02:06:18.291
LAURA: Oh! I'm going to cast Conjure Barrage at
all of the spiders coming at us.

02:06:18.344 --> 02:06:20.186
MATT: All righty.

02:06:20.186 --> 02:06:23.343
LAURA: I'm going to Hunter's Mark whatever one
looks the biggest.

02:06:23.343 --> 02:06:26.693
MATT: Okay, from this position you will also hit
Tiberius to hit all the spiders.

02:06:26.693 --> 02:06:27.585
LAURA: Oh, where am I?

02:06:27.585 --> 02:06:28.947
MATT: You're right here.

02:06:28.947 --> 02:06:30.443
LAURA: Oh.

02:06:30.443 --> 02:06:34.418
TRAVIS: You gotta do what you gotta do. (laughs)
Sorry.

02:06:34.418 --> 02:06:35.579
MATT: I mean, you could--

02:06:35.579 --> 02:06:37.516
LAURA: I'm going to move to where I'm in the
middle of them. I'm still kind of stuck.

02:06:37.516 --> 02:06:38.467
MATT: Right there?

02:06:38.467 --> 02:06:39.156
MARISHA: Get it!

02:06:39.156 --> 02:06:40.317
LAURA: Yeah, and then I'll Conjure Barrage from
there.

02:06:40.317 --> 02:06:40.953
MATT: Okay.

02:06:40.953 --> 02:06:41.853
TRAVIS: (quietly) Don't encourage it.

02:06:41.853 --> 02:06:43.333
LAURA: I cast Hunter's Mark on the biggest one I
see.

02:06:43.333 --> 02:06:44.811
MATT: Okay, this one here is one of the larger
ones.

02:06:44.811 --> 02:06:45.600
LAURA: Okay.

02:06:45.600 --> 02:06:50.805
MATT: So I'm going to go ahead and mark that one.
So go ahead and-- Conjure Barrage does what

02:06:50.805 --> 02:06:51.860
damage?

02:06:51.860 --> 02:06:52.912
TRAVIS: (quietly) Hate it.

02:06:52.912 --> 02:06:54.883
LAURA: It does 3d8 on all creatures.

02:06:54.883 --> 02:06:56.694
MATT: Do they get a saving throw?

02:06:56.694 --> 02:07:00.963
LAURA: They get-- yes, they do. They get
half-damage if they save.

02:07:00.963 --> 02:07:04.625
MATT: Mmkay. What's the DC on your spells?

02:07:04.625 --> 02:07:08.494
LAURA: (in a funny gruff voice) My DC is 14.

02:07:08.494 --> 02:07:09.576
ORION: (laughs)

02:07:09.576 --> 02:07:10.720
MATT: All righty.

02:07:10.720 --> 02:07:12.020
ORION: (mimicking Laura's gruff voice)
MemememememeME.

02:07:12.020 --> 02:07:13.356
MARISHA: What's your DC, girl?

02:07:13.356 --> 02:07:14.078
LAURA: Okay.

02:07:14.078 --> 02:07:16.902
MARISHA: What's yo digits? Gimme those stats.

02:07:16.902 --> 02:07:19.895
MATT: Okay, all you need--

02:07:19.895 --> 02:07:21.199
LAURA: Do I need to roll for attack?

02:07:21.199 --> 02:07:22.124
MATT: Only this one makes it.

02:07:22.124 --> 02:07:23.258
LAURA: Oh, sweet!

02:07:23.258 --> 02:07:24.774
MATT: No, the barrage just happens. They're all
caught in it.

02:07:24.774 --> 02:07:25.489
LAURA: Okay, cool.

02:07:25.489 --> 02:07:27.453
MATT: So all of them take full damage, except for
this one takes half damage, so go ahead and roll

02:07:27.453 --> 02:07:28.639
the damage on that.

02:07:28.639 --> 02:07:40.030
LAURA: Okay. 3d8. 15, and then 20 for the big one
with the Hunter's Mark.

02:07:40.098 --> 02:07:53.523
MATT: All righty. So. So you moved, did that. Do
you want to move Trinket as well?

02:07:53.523 --> 02:07:55.861
LAURA: Can I have Trinket attack?

02:07:55.861 --> 02:07:57.342
MATT: Trinket--

02:07:57.342 --> 02:07:58.808
LAURA: Oh, that's a lot of them.

02:07:58.808 --> 02:08:01.968
MATT: Well, that, and the spell you cast was an
action. Trinket can attack as part of your attack

02:08:01.968 --> 02:08:02.704
round.

02:08:02.704 --> 02:08:04.535
LAURA: Okay, so I get a second attack?

02:08:04.535 --> 02:08:07.074
MATT: Well, no, your spell was an action. So
that's your turn. You do Conjure Barrage instead

02:08:07.074 --> 02:08:08.553
of your attack.

02:08:08.553 --> 02:08:10.146
LAURA: Cool, I'm going to step back against the
wall.

02:08:10.146 --> 02:08:12.763
MATT: All right, so you step back there. Do you
want to move Trinket anywhere in particular?

02:08:12.763 --> 02:08:14.418
LAURA: Nah, he can't really get anywhere, it's
fine.

02:08:14.418 --> 02:08:15.730
MATT: All right, Trinket is there and-- (bear
noises)

02:08:15.730 --> 02:08:17.065
LAURA: It's good times, guys.

02:08:17.065 --> 02:08:19.810
MATT: Angrily, a growl in the distance. Grog,
you're up.

02:08:19.810 --> 02:08:21.536
TRAVIS: I'd like to hold my turn.

02:08:21.536 --> 02:08:22.515
SAM: What?

02:08:22.515 --> 02:08:23.403
ORION: Ooh, yeah!

02:08:23.403 --> 02:08:24.805
MATT: All right, Grog holds initiative.

02:08:24.805 --> 02:08:25.767
ORION: Strategy.

02:08:25.767 --> 02:08:26.832
MARISHA: Must be something good.

02:08:26.832 --> 02:08:27.835
MATT: Pike, you're up.

02:08:27.835 --> 02:08:32.913
ASHLEY: Okay, how far can I move up to use a
Spiritual Weapon? I can't tell where I'm at. I'm

02:08:33.082 --> 02:08:34.224
sorry, I didn't wear my glasses.

02:08:34.224 --> 02:08:36.479
MATT: I mean, you can move through your allies
without an issue. You can shift through your own

02:08:36.479 --> 02:08:38.806
guys without a problem.

02:08:38.870 --> 02:08:44.194
ASHLEY: Okay, so I would like to cast a golden
spiderweb of thorns.

02:08:44.194 --> 02:08:45.141
SAM: Ooh.

02:08:45.141 --> 02:08:46.152
LAURA: (gasps) What?

02:08:46.152 --> 02:08:47.149
MARISHA: Ooh.

02:08:47.149 --> 02:08:48.130
ORION: (laughs) Nice!

02:08:48.130 --> 02:08:49.126
TALIESIN: Fancy.

02:08:49.126 --> 02:08:51.225
MATT: All right. Okay.

02:08:51.225 --> 02:08:53.661
ASHLEY: And encase the spiders.

02:08:53.661 --> 02:08:55.414
MATT: Okay.

02:08:55.414 --> 02:08:56.782
MARISHA: That's cool.

02:08:56.782 --> 02:08:58.664
MATT: Okay.

02:08:58.664 --> 02:09:00.677
(laughter)

02:09:00.677 --> 02:09:02.069
ASHLEY: Like a thorny net.

02:09:02.069 --> 02:09:05.848
MATT: This would be considered a net, if we are
considering a weapon that you are conjuring for this.

02:09:05.848 --> 02:09:07.266
ASHLEY: I'm just making it look really pretty.

02:09:07.266 --> 02:09:08.000
MATT: Right.

02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:09.010
ASHLEY: Basically.

02:09:09.010 --> 02:09:10.802
TRAVIS: (quietly) It looks so pretty.

02:09:10.802 --> 02:09:16.248
MATT: So the effect of this-- I'm letting you hit
multiple guys with this. It would not do any

02:09:16.248 --> 02:09:17.413
damage.

02:09:17.413 --> 02:09:19.206
ASHLEY: It wouldn't do any damage, it would just
contain them?

02:09:19.206 --> 02:09:21.648
MATT: It would possibly have an effect on their
ability--

02:09:21.648 --> 02:09:26.028
ASHLEY: Even if they're thorny? Even like holy
thorns? Oh.

02:09:26.028 --> 02:09:27.745
MATT: It would be very itchy for them.

02:09:27.745 --> 02:09:29.246
ASHLEY: All right, you know what?

02:09:29.246 --> 02:09:30.733
ORION: Oh. Well, I mean, that's not out of--

02:09:30.733 --> 02:09:32.014
LAURA: I think you should stick with it, it's
awesome.

02:09:32.014 --> 02:09:32.911
SAM: Yeah, man, commit.

02:09:32.911 --> 02:09:33.949
ASHLEY: Okay. Contain them.

02:09:33.949 --> 02:09:34.626
ORION: Yeah, it's thematic.

02:09:34.626 --> 02:09:35.946
ASHLEY: Contain them and then somebody could
just--

02:09:35.946 --> 02:09:36.691
LAURA: Fireball.

02:09:36.691 --> 02:09:37.947
ASHLEY: Throw fire, a fireball at them.

02:09:37.947 --> 02:09:40.090
MATT: All right, go ahead and roll a d20 and then
add five to it.

02:09:40.090 --> 02:09:45.161
ASHLEY: Okay. 12.

02:09:45.161 --> 02:09:46.417
MATT: 12? Okay.

02:09:46.417 --> 02:09:57.431
These four in the immediate front, right
there, as you bring back your mace in the air, you

02:09:57.431 --> 02:10:01.934
kind of hang onto the side with the leather strap
around your wrist. You reach up and grab your holy

02:10:01.934 --> 02:10:06.549
symbol. As you release the holy symbol to hold
your hand up, divine energy streaks out from your

02:10:06.597 --> 02:10:13.107
fingertips and forms into this kind of gold and
silver net. As your arm is doing this kind of

02:10:13.107 --> 02:10:18.512
throwing animation in the air like that, the net
shoots out from the front and spreads down onto

02:10:18.512 --> 02:10:20.560
the spiders and contracts around.

02:10:20.560 --> 02:10:24.401
You can see it catches them and they start
scrambling inside. These front four are considered

02:10:24.401 --> 02:10:25.379
grappled.

02:10:25.379 --> 02:10:26.527
(cheering)

02:10:26.527 --> 02:10:27.775
ASHLEY: All right, all right!

02:10:27.775 --> 02:10:29.190
MATT: The one in the back managed to avoid it.

02:10:29.190 --> 02:10:29.901
ORION: Cool.

02:10:29.901 --> 02:10:30.804
LAURA: Nice!

02:10:30.804 --> 02:10:31.632
MARISHA: Nice!

02:10:31.632 --> 02:10:33.276
MATT: That's it? That brings it to Keyleth.

02:10:33.276 --> 02:10:35.962
MARISHA: Okay, with that new development--

02:10:36.026 --> 02:10:38.773
ORION: Wait. Can you do lightning?

02:10:38.773 --> 02:10:46.006
MARISHA: I can. I'm going to do Poison Spray,
though. Where am I right now?

02:10:46.006 --> 02:10:49.275
MATT: You're right here. Behind Pike as she threw
her giant golden net.

02:10:49.275 --> 02:10:54.266
MARISHA: I'm going to be like, 'scuse me, 'scuse
me, Pike, 'scuse me. Sorry, sorry.

02:10:54.266 --> 02:10:55.854
ASHLEY: Yes? Oh, go through, go through, go go
go!

02:10:55.854 --> 02:10:57.350
MARISHA: Thank you, thank you, thank you.

02:10:57.350 --> 02:10:58.831
ASHLEY: Tag you in! Tag you in!

02:10:58.831 --> 02:11:02.794
MARISHA: (whoosh) Poison Spray! It's a ten-foot
cone.

02:11:02.794 --> 02:11:09.048
MATT: Ten-foot cone. If you want to get right up
in here you could get these three there.

02:11:09.048 --> 02:11:10.218
MARISHA: I'll do that.

02:11:10.218 --> 02:11:11.121
MATT: Okay.

02:11:11.121 --> 02:11:14.237
MARISHA: (whoosh) So, it's a constitution saving
throw.

02:11:14.237 --> 02:11:20.903
MATT: Okay. This one succeeds, this one fails,
this one fails.

02:11:20.903 --> 02:11:24.034
SAM: (singing along with the battle music) It's
the music that means we're having a fight.

02:11:24.034 --> 02:11:27.173
MATT: All right. So, this one succeeds, so no
damage, but these two take damage. Go ahead and

02:11:27.173 --> 02:11:28.066
roll it.

02:11:28.066 --> 02:11:33.687
MARISHA: Okay, so they take 2d12. Six. Ugh. Seven
damage.

02:11:33.687 --> 02:11:35.574
MATT: Seven damage to each.

02:11:35.574 --> 02:11:39.037
MARISHA: It's not great. I think he takes half
damage, though, even though he fails.

02:11:39.037 --> 02:11:41.524
MATT: Does he? I think Poison Mist--

02:11:41.524 --> 02:11:42.935
MARISHA: Poison Spray.

02:11:42.935 --> 02:11:45.381
MATT: Oh, Poison Spray. It's a cantrip. I think
it's damage or nothing.

02:11:45.381 --> 02:11:47.955
MARISHA: Oh, yeah, I guess so.

02:11:47.955 --> 02:11:51.709
MATT: All right. It's your move, do you want to
keep moving or do you want to stay where you are?

02:11:51.709 --> 02:11:58.580
MARISHA: Can I get out of everyone's way?

02:11:58.580 --> 02:12:04.128
MATT: You're currently-- actually, down from where
you cast it, you would be able to move out, yeah.

02:12:04.128 --> 02:12:05.733
MARISHA: Can I back up a little bit? Yeah.

02:12:05.733 --> 02:12:06.917
MATT: You can, they're still grappled.

02:12:06.917 --> 02:12:08.286
MARISHA: I just kind of want to-- yeah.

02:12:08.286 --> 02:12:09.387
MATT: To there. All right.

02:12:09.387 --> 02:12:10.420
MARISHA: Your turn!

02:12:10.420 --> 02:12:12.688
MATT: That ends your turn. Vax, Percy.

02:12:12.688 --> 02:12:16.020
TALIESIN: Please, be my guest.

02:12:16.020 --> 02:12:18.014
LIAM: Did you say Vax, Percy?

02:12:18.014 --> 02:12:18.809
MATT: Yes.

02:12:18.809 --> 02:12:19.621
TRAVIS: Yep.

02:12:19.621 --> 02:12:22.888
LIAM: I'm doing my best seeing from where I can
see here. Keyleth is right in front of me?

02:12:22.888 --> 02:12:25.254
MATT: She was. She just pulled behind you.

02:12:25.254 --> 02:12:26.258
MARISHA: I moved behind.

02:12:26.258 --> 02:12:27.343
LAURA: Now you're in front of the spiders.

02:12:27.343 --> 02:12:28.597
MARISHA: You're good, you're in front.

02:12:28.597 --> 02:12:31.802
LIAM: Okay, there's a little bit of distance, so
I'm just going to start hucking daggers at them.

02:12:31.802 --> 02:12:35.218
I'm going to start with dagger of life stealing.

02:12:35.218 --> 02:12:37.713
MARISHA: You're only two squares away.

02:12:37.713 --> 02:12:40.771
LIAM: That is a 16 to hit.

02:12:40.771 --> 02:12:42.431
MATT: 16 to hit? Hits.

02:12:42.431 --> 02:12:49.467
LIAM: Okay, so that is four, six, is ten of
damage.

02:12:49.467 --> 02:12:50.451
MATT: All right.

02:12:50.451 --> 02:12:54.597
LIAM: Then the keen dagger follows. That is a 27.

02:12:54.597 --> 02:12:55.905
MATT: That hits.

02:12:55.905 --> 02:12:59.940
LIAM: That hits for ten damage, and then--

02:12:59.940 --> 02:13:01.625
LAURA: You're killing them!

02:13:01.625 --> 02:13:02.896
LIAM: And then the flametongue dagger.

02:13:02.896 --> 02:13:06.970
MATT: You're not Hasted anymore, by the way.

02:13:07.032 --> 02:13:10.084
LIAM: You're right, forget it, yeah, forget that
last. That's right, two.

02:13:10.084 --> 02:13:15.956
MATT: So as you're off to the side hiding among
the slowly burning webbing, you move around, huck

02:13:16.167 --> 02:13:20.739
both daggers. One strikes a spider right in the
center of where its eyes are and it screeches for

02:13:20.947 --> 02:13:27.202
a second before it curls up, its legs kind of
pulling into its torso. The other one begins to

02:13:27.202 --> 02:13:31.922
pull out of the net that Pike set, and as it does
you throw the secondary dagger. It strikes it in

02:13:31.922 --> 02:13:36.833
its abdomen, and the blade retracts and returns to
your belt, and as it does, it leaves this streak

02:13:36.833 --> 02:13:41.965
of greenish liquid. And you have a better view of
these spiders now. Go ahead and make a nature

02:13:41.965 --> 02:13:46.259
check, both Keyleth and Vex.

02:13:46.259 --> 02:13:47.436
MARISHA: Dope.

02:13:47.436 --> 02:13:51.043
ORION: By the way, I'm here, but I'm also there.

02:13:51.043 --> 02:13:52.925
MARISHA: Natural 20.

02:13:52.925 --> 02:13:54.718
(yelling)

02:13:54.718 --> 02:13:55.867
MATT: You're also there?

02:13:55.867 --> 02:13:56.751
ORION: Cloak of Displacement.

02:13:56.751 --> 02:13:57.908
LAURA: Good, because I rolled an eight.

02:13:57.908 --> 02:13:58.705
MATT: Oh.

02:13:58.705 --> 02:13:59.721
ORION: There's like two of me.

02:13:59.721 --> 02:14:02.204
MATT: All right. So, Keyleth

02:14:02.204 --> 02:14:04.151
SAM: (whistles with the battle music)

02:14:04.151 --> 02:14:07.757
MATT: You notice as most spider-like creatures go,
you're used to like the darker, furry, wolf-spider

02:14:07.757 --> 02:14:16.371
types. These have a different color. Their
physical bodies are more white and blue. Their

02:14:16.371 --> 02:14:20.629
coloration is mostly white but with a kind of
bluish hue to it and their eyes are almost

02:14:20.629 --> 02:14:22.639
pink-white in color.

02:14:22.639 --> 02:14:23.684
LAURA: Ugh.

02:14:23.684 --> 02:14:25.280
ASHLEY: Because they live underground. There's no
sunlight.

02:14:25.280 --> 02:14:27.033
MATT: They're a very strange, different kind of
spider.

02:14:27.033 --> 02:14:28.370
LIAM: I don't like this.

02:14:28.370 --> 02:14:30.378
MARISHA: Is that all I know, with my natural 20?

02:14:30.378 --> 02:14:36.510
MATT: You haven't encountered too many types of
arachnids, but there's something about them that

02:14:36.510 --> 02:14:40.416
seems loosely themed in the ethereal.

02:14:40.416 --> 02:14:41.784
LAURA: Oh.

02:14:41.784 --> 02:14:43.854
MARISHA: Hm.

02:14:43.854 --> 02:14:51.554
MATT: You in your experience, you've heard of
certain spiders that can travel through the planes

02:14:51.554 --> 02:14:52.976
rapidly.

02:14:52.976 --> 02:14:55.759
ORION: Now damn plane spiders?

02:14:55.759 --> 02:14:57.662
TRAVIS: Maybe we don't have to kill it, maybe they
just (pfft).

02:14:57.662 --> 02:14:58.482
MARISHA: Gotcha.

02:14:58.482 --> 02:15:00.860
Hey, guys, I think these are like magical
bamf-ing spiders.

02:15:00.910 --> 02:15:01.982
ORION: Oh.

02:15:01.982 --> 02:15:02.784
TALIESIN: Okay.

02:15:02.784 --> 02:15:03.706
SAM: Cool, bro, let's kill them.

02:15:03.706 --> 02:15:04.798
MARISHA: Yeah, let's kill them.

02:15:04.798 --> 02:15:06.395
TALIESIN: There's one spider that's not caught?

02:15:06.395 --> 02:15:08.392
LAURA: There's what, there's three spiders left?

02:15:08.392 --> 02:15:09.537
MATT: Yes, one back here.

02:15:09.537 --> 02:15:13.039
TALIESIN: All right, I'm going to take a couple of
shots at it with my Sharpshooter, so let's start

02:15:13.039 --> 02:15:19.757
with 24 to hit?

02:15:19.757 --> 02:15:22.765
MATT: What was it?

02:15:22.765 --> 02:15:23.917
TALIESIN: 24 to hit?

02:15:23.917 --> 02:15:25.100
MATT: That hits.

02:15:25.100 --> 02:15:26.988
TALIESIN: And let's do this. My first shot--

02:15:26.988 --> 02:15:28.505
SAM: Ka-pew!

02:15:28.505 --> 02:15:30.510
TALIESIN: That's depressing.

02:15:30.510 --> 02:15:34.047
Well, I get the bonus, so that's 18
points of damage.

02:15:34.112 --> 02:15:36.115
MATT: 18 points of damage? All righty.

02:15:36.115 --> 02:15:37.018
MARISHA: That's not too depressing.

02:15:37.018 --> 02:15:37.835
ASHLEY: That's not depressing at all.

02:15:37.835 --> 02:15:38.863
TRAVIS: That's not depressing.

02:15:38.863 --> 02:15:41.191
TALIESIN: That's not too depressing. It's because
I'm taking a negative five to hit.

02:15:41.191 --> 02:15:42.754
LAURA: Oh.

02:15:42.814 --> 02:15:51.926
TALIESIN: And that's-- oh, that's not bad. I have
new numbers. 16 to hit.

02:15:51.926 --> 02:15:54.058
MATT: 16 does also hit, yeah.

02:15:54.058 --> 02:15:55.051
TALIESIN: Aha!

02:15:55.051 --> 02:15:55.948
MATT: Same target?

02:15:55.948 --> 02:16:05.088
TALIESIN: Same target, with an added fire bonus.
Three fire damage and 17 as well.

02:16:05.088 --> 02:16:06.205
MATT: All right.

02:16:06.205 --> 02:16:07.297
TALIESIN: 17 plus three fire damage.

02:16:07.297 --> 02:16:08.241
ASHLEY: That bonus is awesome.

02:16:08.241 --> 02:16:09.178
LAURA: He is so dead.

02:16:09.178 --> 02:16:10.822
MATT: (gunshot noise) That spider gets splattered.
You see there's a burst of flame and a (explosion

02:16:10.822 --> 02:16:15.552
noise) as its body is knocked in the air, torn
asunder, and then consumed by the flame burst at

02:16:15.552 --> 02:16:20.182
the same time. You see what looks like a
scattering of ash across the ground and the steps

02:16:20.182 --> 02:16:20.996
beneath it.

02:16:20.996 --> 02:16:22.366
MARISHA: It looks like flash paper?

02:16:22.366 --> 02:16:23.126
MATT: Essentially, yeah.

02:16:23.126 --> 02:16:24.389
TALIESIN: And I duck back behind Grog.

02:16:24.389 --> 02:16:25.805
(laughter)

02:16:25.805 --> 02:16:27.762
TRAVIS: Where are you going?

02:16:27.762 --> 02:16:37.029
MATT: All right. These two spiders that are
currently caught in the net both (whoosh) vanish

02:16:37.029 --> 02:16:38.132
and the net falls flat.

02:16:38.132 --> 02:16:40.111
LAURA: Oh, bamf-ing spiders.

02:16:40.111 --> 02:16:41.537
MATT: (teleportation noise)

02:16:41.537 --> 02:16:44.451
TALIESIN: Oh, shit.

02:16:44.451 --> 02:16:48.247
MATT: One is striking at you.

02:16:48.247 --> 02:16:49.693
LAURA: Me?

02:16:49.693 --> 02:16:52.644
MATT: That is a 21 to hit.

02:16:52.644 --> 02:16:54.149
LAURA: It hits me.

02:16:54.149 --> 02:16:56.195
MATT: And against Percy, that is a 25.

02:16:56.195 --> 02:16:57.844
TALIESIN: Oh my god, that hits.

02:16:57.844 --> 02:17:01.794
MATT: All right. You both take 13 points of
piercing damage

02:17:01.794 --> 02:17:02.778
TALIESIN: Ow!

02:17:02.778 --> 02:17:05.405
MATT: And I need you both to make a constitution
saving throw.

02:17:05.405 --> 02:17:06.992
(groaning)

02:17:06.992 --> 02:17:10.590
TALIESIN: Oh, bugger.

02:17:10.590 --> 02:17:11.931
MARISHA: That can't be good.

02:17:11.931 --> 02:17:13.466
TALIESIN: 13 points of piercing damage?

02:17:13.466 --> 02:17:14.755
MATT: Mm-hm.

02:17:14.755 --> 02:17:16.386
MARISHA: They poofed. Poofers.

02:17:16.386 --> 02:17:18.297
LAURA: 17? Oh, wait. 19.

02:17:18.297 --> 02:17:21.457
MATT: 19 constitution saving throw.

02:17:21.457 --> 02:17:25.366
TALIESIN: Constitution saving throw. (blows
raspberry)

02:17:25.366 --> 02:17:27.128
MARISHA: Oh, no, Percy!

02:17:27.128 --> 02:17:28.546
TALIESIN: Rolled a one.

02:17:28.546 --> 02:17:32.918
MATT: So as all of a sudden, the strange
(teleportation noise) sound streaks behind you,

02:17:32.918 --> 02:17:36.804
you turn over your shoulder just in time to see
the spiders pop out of seemingly nowhere and

02:17:36.804 --> 02:17:40.453
strike into you. The fangs sink into your side and
you knock them off with your elbow.

02:17:40.453 --> 02:17:41.675
LAURA: (grunts in pain)

02:17:41.675 --> 02:17:46.642
MATT: You feel the venom extract itself from the
fangs, but just as you pull it out of the side,

02:17:46.642 --> 02:17:51.156
so it actually does not envenom your body. Percy,
you're not so lucky. The venom pulses into the

02:17:51.218 --> 02:17:52.170
side of your shoulder.

02:17:52.170 --> 02:17:53.339
TALIESIN: (groans in pain)

02:17:53.339 --> 02:17:56.905
MATT: And you feel this burning sensation ripple
through your entire upper right torso. You take 21

02:17:56.905 --> 02:17:58.600
points of poison damage.

02:17:58.600 --> 02:18:00.570
MARISHA: Oh, shit!

02:18:00.570 --> 02:18:05.177
LIAM: What was that number, again?

02:18:05.177 --> 02:18:06.627
ALL: 21.

02:18:06.627 --> 02:18:08.339
SAM: He's fine, he's fine.

02:18:08.339 --> 02:18:10.403
MARISHA: Is that all it does, just poison him?

02:18:10.403 --> 02:18:11.344
MATT: Yep.

02:18:11.344 --> 02:18:12.586
TALIESIN: I am poisoned, though.

02:18:12.586 --> 02:18:14.376
MATT: You are not considered poisoned. It's the
damage that's poison.

02:18:14.376 --> 02:18:15.469
LAURA: Oh, it's straight-up damage.

02:18:15.469 --> 02:18:17.577
MARISHA: Okay, that's not too bad.

02:18:17.577 --> 02:18:19.383
TALIESIN: It could be worse.

02:18:19.383 --> 02:18:22.307
MATT: That ends their turn. Tiberius? You're still
holding your turn, Grog?

02:18:22.307 --> 02:18:23.273
TRAVIS: Mm-hm.

02:18:23.273 --> 02:18:24.284
MARISHA: I did take Protection From Poison.

02:18:24.284 --> 02:18:25.348
LAURA: I should cast that on us.

02:18:25.348 --> 02:18:26.500
MARISHA: If that's necessary.

02:18:26.500 --> 02:18:28.035
MATT: All right, Tiberius?

02:18:28.035 --> 02:18:29.369
ORION: So we're in a hallway, a stairwell?

02:18:29.369 --> 02:18:32.259
MATT: Yes, it's a stairway heading down,
essentially, right here, and then it evens out at

02:18:32.259 --> 02:18:33.440
the bottom point there.

02:18:33.440 --> 02:18:35.925
MARISHA: Fighting on the stairs.

02:18:35.925 --> 02:18:39.250
ORION: Is it like a big--

02:18:39.250 --> 02:18:44.786
MATT: It's about 15 feet up to the ceiling. Ten,
15.

02:18:44.786 --> 02:18:46.695
ORION: Oh. Very well.

02:18:46.695 --> 02:18:47.956
How many are left, two?

02:18:47.956 --> 02:18:48.750
MATT: Two.

02:18:48.750 --> 02:18:49.483
LAURA: Yeah.

02:18:49.483 --> 02:18:50.875
ORION: Obelisk of Stone.

02:18:50.875 --> 02:18:52.104
MATT: Okay.

02:18:52.104 --> 02:18:53.229
MARISHA: Squishy spiders.

02:18:53.229 --> 02:18:54.282
ORION: Yeah, these squishy spiders.

02:18:54.282 --> 02:18:59.322
MATT: So as both the spiders are knocked off both
Percy and Vex, you guys kind of rear back, ready

02:18:59.322 --> 02:19:04.573
to defend yourselves. Suddenly the stairwell
shakes for a second and pillars of stone go (stone

02:19:04.573 --> 02:19:08.922
crushing noises) from underneath. Similar to the
trap room you encountered earlier.

02:19:08.922 --> 02:19:17.948
ORION: That's it. 21.

02:19:17.948 --> 02:19:20.392
MATT: 21? And what's the DC on your spell?

02:19:20.392 --> 02:19:21.373
ORION: 17.

02:19:21.373 --> 02:19:26.993
MATT: 17? Both spiders get mashed pretty horribly
into the ceiling. You see where the pillars are

02:19:26.993 --> 02:19:31.533
slammed into the ceiling permanently. You can see
the legs kind of dangling out for a second and then

02:19:31.533 --> 02:19:35.280
slowly curl in towards where the edge of the
stone pillars are at the ceiling.

02:19:35.343 --> 02:19:36.443
LAURA: Eat it.

02:19:36.443 --> 02:19:40.665
MARISHA: Are there any corpses that are more
accessible than the one that got torched and the

02:19:40.665 --> 02:19:41.801
ones that are squished?

02:19:41.801 --> 02:19:44.156
TRAVIS: Yeah, are there any spider fangs we can
put in the bag?

02:19:44.156 --> 02:19:46.876
MARISHA: Yeah, because I have that book that helps
me do that now.

02:19:46.876 --> 02:19:48.189
TALIESIN: There's the one I shot.

02:19:48.189 --> 02:19:54.162
MATT: You can, actually, there are-- there's one
that you shot. No, actually, the one that you

02:19:54.162 --> 02:19:56.019
killed is the one that burst into flame.

02:19:56.019 --> 02:19:57.515
TALIESIN: Yes, the one that burst into flame.

02:19:57.515 --> 02:20:01.076
MATT: That one's not going to be salvageable.
There's a few that you and Vex killed. Vex and Vax

02:20:01.076 --> 02:20:05.175
both just kind of wiped out a few of the spiders.
Go ahead and make an herbalism roll.

02:20:05.175 --> 02:20:09.225
LAURA: Ooh, I bet we can get some of that poison.
Dip the arrows in it.

02:20:09.225 --> 02:20:14.935
MARISHA: What did the book do again, gave me a
plus or an advantage? Did it give me an advantage

02:20:14.935 --> 02:20:17.313
on rolls or like a plus something?

02:20:17.313 --> 02:20:20.185
MATT: I asked you to write that down. I will say
advantage.

02:20:20.185 --> 02:20:22.315
MARISHA: Oh, wait, you did ask me to write it down
and I think I did.

02:20:22.315 --> 02:20:24.545
MATT: Advantage or a bonus, which of the two is
it?

02:20:24.545 --> 02:20:26.946
MARISHA: Oh, no, I didn't write it down, I just
wrote that I have the books.

02:20:26.946 --> 02:20:30.987
MATT: Ah. I don't remember what I did for that.

02:20:31.034 --> 02:20:34.794
I will say advantage. That's the easiest to
remember.

02:20:34.794 --> 02:20:40.534
MARISHA: That's better. 24.

02:20:40.534 --> 02:20:47.198
MATT: 24. You managed to extract two poison glands
from one of the spiders. The other ones were too

02:20:47.198 --> 02:20:48.542
damaged beyond repair.

02:20:48.542 --> 02:20:49.255
LAURA: Ooh.

02:20:49.255 --> 02:20:49.950
ORION: Sweet.

02:20:49.950 --> 02:20:50.773
MARISHA: Two poison glands.

02:20:50.773 --> 02:20:51.707
MATT: Two small venom glands.

02:20:51.707 --> 02:20:52.407
ORION: Nice.

02:20:52.407 --> 02:20:54.128
MARISHA: I give them to the twins.

02:20:54.128 --> 02:20:54.938
MATT: Okay.

02:20:54.938 --> 02:20:56.363
LAURA: Oh, we can just use them?

02:20:56.363 --> 02:20:57.132
MATT: You don't know.

02:20:57.132 --> 02:20:57.989
LAURA: Okay.

02:20:57.989 --> 02:21:00.564
MATT: She hands you two nasty-looking glands that
are still wet with spider ichor.

02:21:00.564 --> 02:21:02.037
MARISHA: I got this for you guys.

02:21:02.037 --> 02:21:03.481
LAURA: Oh, thank you, Keyleth.

02:21:03.481 --> 02:21:04.950
TRAVIS: Do you want me to hold onto them?

02:21:04.950 --> 02:21:07.298
LIAM: That's very... that's sweet. I love it.

02:21:07.298 --> 02:21:11.030
LAURA: Tiberius, would you happen to have a little
glass vial or something I could put this in?

02:21:11.030 --> 02:21:12.355
ORION: I think I have two left.

02:21:12.355 --> 02:21:13.129
LAURA: Oh!

02:21:13.129 --> 02:21:14.093
ORION: I need to get more.

02:21:14.093 --> 02:21:14.964
TRAVIS: I have them.

02:21:14.964 --> 02:21:15.948
ORION: Oh, here we go. (pop)

02:21:15.948 --> 02:21:17.009
LAURA: Thank you.

02:21:17.009 --> 02:21:19.299
TALIESIN: (laughs) Well.

02:21:19.299 --> 02:21:21.711
TRAVIS: I'm like a Wal-Mart over here. You could
have asked me, but that's cool.

02:21:21.711 --> 02:21:23.278
MARISHA: Your book helps.

02:21:23.278 --> 02:21:24.722
SAM: I'm ready to make my attack turn.

02:21:24.722 --> 02:21:28.023
MATT: All right. There is nothing there.

02:21:28.023 --> 02:21:29.758
(laughter)

02:21:29.758 --> 02:21:32.076
SAM: I sheath my sword.

02:21:32.076 --> 02:21:33.381
MATT: There you go.

02:21:33.381 --> 02:21:35.134
(laughter)

02:21:35.134 --> 02:21:40.146
TALIESIN: A little help here, please? Would be
nice.

02:21:40.146 --> 02:21:40.950
ASHLEY: Yes.

02:21:40.950 --> 02:21:42.782
LAURA: Oh. Oh, wait, I thought you weren't
poisoned-- oh, you need healing because you are--

02:21:42.782 --> 02:21:43.901
ASHLEY: What are you at?

02:21:43.901 --> 02:21:45.104
TALIESIN: I'm at 47.

02:21:45.104 --> 02:21:45.840
LAURA: Okay.

02:21:45.840 --> 02:21:46.740
ASHLEY: Okay.

02:21:46.740 --> 02:21:48.164
SAM: Eh, you're fine. Suck it up.

02:21:48.164 --> 02:21:49.963
ASHLEY: I guess we all need some-- what's
everybody else at?

02:21:49.963 --> 02:21:54.670
LIAM: Ah, that's what I was at after I healed
myself with a handful of hit dice after getting

02:21:54.670 --> 02:21:55.913
crushed into the ceiling.

02:21:55.913 --> 02:21:57.679
LAURA: Yeah, but we took a short break and we're
not doing that now.

02:21:57.679 --> 02:21:59.498
SAM: Use your hit dice, you'll be fine.

02:21:59.498 --> 02:22:01.057
TALIESIN: I could just use my-- oh.

02:22:01.057 --> 02:22:02.031
ASHLEY: Um, hold on.

02:22:02.031 --> 02:22:03.481
MATT: Are you guys taking a short rest, is that
what you're doing?

02:22:03.481 --> 02:22:04.136
LAURA: No.

02:22:04.136 --> 02:22:04.878
TRAVIS: No, no.

02:22:04.878 --> 02:22:05.748
MARISHA: No, we're good.

02:22:05.748 --> 02:22:06.970
ASHLEY: Let me heal you up, Percy, hold on.

02:22:06.970 --> 02:22:08.037
LAURA: Can I ask a question while she's healing
Percy?

02:22:08.037 --> 02:22:09.085
ORION: We've taken a short rest already, right?

02:22:09.085 --> 02:22:09.954
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:22:09.954 --> 02:22:11.875
LAURA: The grappling arrow I used on the little
halfling, I can get that back, right?

02:22:11.875 --> 02:22:13.208
MATT: Yeah, you retrieved it.

02:22:13.208 --> 02:22:15.746
LAURA: Just making sure.

02:22:15.746 --> 02:22:19.335
SAM: I'll continue on down the hallway.

02:22:19.335 --> 02:22:20.766
TRAVIS: I join him.

02:22:20.766 --> 02:22:23.797
MATT: Keyleth, are you still using Pass Without a
Trace?

02:22:23.797 --> 02:22:25.919
MARISHA: No.

02:22:25.919 --> 02:22:26.854
LAURA: No?

02:22:26.854 --> 02:22:28.945
SAM: She had to break it to use Stoneskin.

02:22:28.945 --> 02:22:30.091
MATT: It's a concentration spell, isn't it?

02:22:30.091 --> 02:22:31.406
MARISHA: Yeah, but I cast Stoneskin on myself.

02:22:31.406 --> 02:22:33.381
MATT: You did. All right. So go ahead and make a
stealth roll.

02:22:33.381 --> 02:22:34.542
MARISHA: Sorry.

02:22:34.542 --> 02:22:38.099
SAM: Not good. Nine.

02:22:38.099 --> 02:22:39.308
TRAVIS: I'm with you.

02:22:39.308 --> 02:22:40.211
MATT: Nine. All right.

02:22:40.211 --> 02:22:41.545
SAM: (nasal voice) Nine.

02:22:41.545 --> 02:22:42.835
ASHLEY: Nine, Percy.

02:22:42.835 --> 02:22:46.270
LIAM: I would like to continue to stealth ahead of
the group and also continue checking for traps.

02:22:46.270 --> 02:22:47.599
SAM: We already went.

02:22:47.599 --> 02:22:48.921
TRAVIS: Scanlan's already ahead of you.

02:22:48.921 --> 02:22:49.746
LAURA: Sam already said it.

02:22:49.746 --> 02:22:50.685
LIAM: Oh, he is?

02:22:50.685 --> 02:22:54.412
MATT: As you stealthily move along the side of the
wall, Scanlan comes pattering down the stonework.

02:22:54.412 --> 02:22:55.542
SAM: Skipping.

02:22:55.542 --> 02:22:58.455
ASHLEY: Percy, 18.

02:22:58.455 --> 02:22:59.747
TALIESIN: 18? Thank you.

02:22:59.747 --> 02:23:00.916
LAURA: Scanlan, no. (groans)

02:23:00.916 --> 02:23:04.229
MATT: Into what is a large central chamber. You
can see webbing scattered throughout the entirety

02:23:04.229 --> 02:23:12.840
of the stone room. It's about 60 feet up. There is
very low light from the flickering sconces that

02:23:12.840 --> 02:23:18.545
are on the walls of this towards the base of the
actual room. The building in the center, it looks

02:23:18.545 --> 02:23:22.940
almost like an ancient mausoleum structure, how
it's placed in the center of the room. Closed

02:23:22.993 --> 02:23:27.349
stone doors. But what catches your eye is that the
entirety of the structure seems to be crafted of

02:23:27.349 --> 02:23:32.951
the same platinum-like material as the container
that you guys are carrying the horn in.

02:23:32.951 --> 02:23:33.935
LAURA: Oh, wow.

02:23:33.935 --> 02:23:35.004
SAM: Oh, we made it.

02:23:35.004 --> 02:23:36.819
LAURA: Are there sapphires all over the walls in
here, then?

02:23:36.819 --> 02:23:40.614
MATT: Not the walls of the actual chamber itself,
just this central building right there.

02:23:40.614 --> 02:23:42.885
ORION: We're not stealing from this place.

02:23:42.885 --> 02:23:45.259
MATT: Go ahead and make a perception check, anyone
who wishes to look for traps.

02:23:45.259 --> 02:23:46.307
SAM: While we're out there, I'm going to check--

02:23:46.307 --> 02:23:49.173
LAURA: (gasps) Oh no, that was my big fancy one.

02:23:49.173 --> 02:23:53.956
ORION: Nice. I'm going to check for any arcane
stuff and I got--

02:23:53.956 --> 02:23:55.127
LIAM: 14.

02:23:55.127 --> 02:23:56.567
MATT: 14 perception.

02:23:56.567 --> 02:23:57.655
LIAM: Yeah, 14.

02:23:57.655 --> 02:23:59.757
ORION: I'm going to check for 25.

02:23:59.757 --> 02:24:01.098
TALIESIN: 21.

02:24:01.098 --> 02:24:03.053
MATT: Perception?

02:24:03.053 --> 02:24:04.359
TALIESIN: Perception, 21.

02:24:04.359 --> 02:24:06.398
MATT: Okay. 25 for arcane?

02:24:06.398 --> 02:24:07.372
ORION: Yeah.

02:24:07.372 --> 02:24:16.025
MATT: Best you can gather, as far as the presence
of any arcane in this room, the scrolling on the

02:24:16.025 --> 02:24:24.358
structure in front of you, there are elements of
the scrolling that you can see are based in the

02:24:24.358 --> 02:24:31.557
arcane runes that are used for ritual inscribing,
but there's nothing of any magic that you've ever

02:24:31.557 --> 02:24:36.440
been familiar with that is utilized in this
structure. What did you roll?

02:24:36.440 --> 02:24:39.391
LAURA: Really, really high. Eight.

02:24:39.391 --> 02:24:43.240
MATT: All right. So, who is moving in? Who wants
to--

02:24:43.240 --> 02:24:45.473
SAM: I moved in with Grog.

02:24:45.473 --> 02:24:46.979
TRAVIS: I move in as well.

02:24:46.979 --> 02:24:48.096
LIAM: I'm moving in.

02:24:48.096 --> 02:24:50.843
LAURA: Can I try to stealth and move alongside
just kind of keep to the edge?

02:24:50.843 --> 02:24:51.620
ASHLEY: Going in.

02:24:51.620 --> 02:24:52.593
TRAVIS: We're all going in.

02:24:52.593 --> 02:24:53.692
LIAM: Ditto, kiddo.

02:24:53.692 --> 02:24:55.919
MATT: All right, you move off to the side, kind of
pushing through some of the webs and there's still

02:24:55.919 --> 02:24:57.351
webs on the side of the room.

02:24:57.351 --> 02:25:00.523
ORION: I'll keep close to the guards and the box.

02:25:00.523 --> 02:25:01.607
ASHLEY: Yeah, I'll go in.

02:25:01.607 --> 02:25:03.292
LAURA: Okay, I rolled 18 on the stealth.

02:25:03.292 --> 02:25:04.196
MATT: All righty.

02:25:04.196 --> 02:25:06.209
ASHLEY: I'll go in close to Grog.

02:25:06.209 --> 02:25:07.382
MATT: All righty.

02:25:07.382 --> 02:25:08.394
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:25:08.394 --> 02:25:09.932
LIAM: I'm going to tail my sister, actually.

02:25:09.932 --> 02:25:13.084
MATT: All right. (whoosh) You move around over
here with your sister.

02:25:13.084 --> 02:25:16.256
LAURA: And Trinket's going to stay next to
Keyleth.

02:25:16.256 --> 02:25:17.503
MATT: All righty.

02:25:17.503 --> 02:25:19.063
MARISHA: Come here, Trinket.

02:25:19.063 --> 02:25:20.186
MATT: So they'll go back to this point.

02:25:20.186 --> 02:25:22.010
SAM: I'm going to go invisible.

02:25:22.010 --> 02:25:27.996
TALIESIN: Wait. I'm furry, but I'm not Trinket.
Jesus Christ.

02:25:27.996 --> 02:25:29.592
MARISHA: (laughs)

02:25:29.592 --> 02:25:31.176
MATT: All right, you are currently marked as
invisible, Scanlan.

02:25:31.176 --> 02:25:33.810
LAURA: Can we see a spider in here, like a big
spider?

02:25:33.810 --> 02:25:35.148
MATT: You don't.

02:25:35.148 --> 02:25:37.036
MARISHA: There's always a big mama spider.

02:25:37.036 --> 02:25:38.747
LAURA: Okay, can I-- it's dark?

02:25:38.747 --> 02:25:39.771
MATT: It's very low light.

02:25:39.771 --> 02:25:41.084
SAM: No one's cast Light yet.

02:25:41.084 --> 02:25:41.969
ORION: I know.

02:25:41.969 --> 02:25:44.502
LAURA: I'm going to use my Primeval Awareness and
see if I can sense any spiders in the area.

02:25:44.502 --> 02:25:54.682
MATT: Okay. You take a moment to concentrate and
you sense-- while not in visible range, on the

02:25:54.682 --> 02:26:04.053
opposite side of this room, a whole bunch of tiny
little life sources and one rather large one.

02:26:04.053 --> 02:26:05.494
LAURA: Good to know.

02:26:05.494 --> 02:26:06.358
TRAVIS: Shit.

02:26:06.358 --> 02:26:07.191
ASHLEY: Ugh.

02:26:07.191 --> 02:26:11.771
LAURA: (whispers) Lots of spiders. Lots. I'm going
to cast Protection From Poison on myself.

02:26:11.771 --> 02:26:12.746
MATT: All right.

02:26:12.746 --> 02:26:14.260
TRAVIS: I cast Terminix.

02:26:14.260 --> 02:26:15.979
TALIESIN: (laughs)

02:26:15.979 --> 02:26:19.132
LIAM: I'm drinking a healing potion right now.

02:26:19.132 --> 02:26:20.467
MATT: All righty.

02:26:20.467 --> 02:26:22.929
ASHLEY: I'm going to do the same thing.

02:26:22.929 --> 02:26:27.529
MARISHA: Also, I'll go ahead and-- nah, nah, it's
fine.

02:26:27.529 --> 02:26:29.778
TALIESIN: What does a level two healing potion do,
again?

02:26:29.778 --> 02:26:31.721
MARISHA: I'm going to keep my Stoneskin up.

02:26:31.721 --> 02:26:33.954
ASHLEY: Yeah, what's the level two?

02:26:33.954 --> 02:26:38.607
MATT: Level two healing potion does 4d4 + 4.

02:26:38.607 --> 02:26:43.629
ORION: I'm going to go use Greater Invisibility,
as well.

02:26:43.629 --> 02:26:46.309
MATT: Okay. All right. You are also considered
invisible.

02:26:46.309 --> 02:26:47.531
SAM: Why greater?

02:26:47.531 --> 02:26:51.362
ORION: Because I can cast and still stay
invisible.

02:26:51.362 --> 02:26:59.017
MATT: All right, Kima pushes ahead through the group
while you guys are doing this, walks up to the

02:26:59.066 --> 02:27:03.473
front of the chamber, and you see she takes the
holy symbol around from her neck, the symbol of

02:27:03.524 --> 02:27:09.266
Bahamut, and much like she did to the doorway at
the bottom of the temple earlier to find this

02:27:09.266 --> 02:27:14.804
initial passageway, she feels around in the
scrolling and eventually finds a section of it and

02:27:14.804 --> 02:27:20.844
rotates what looks like a circular part of it that
shifts and then pulls out. When she pulls it out,

02:27:20.844 --> 02:27:27.117
you can see there is a kind of engraving, there is
a recessed engraving of the same shape as her holy

02:27:27.117 --> 02:27:28.144
symbol.

02:27:28.144 --> 02:27:32.123
LAURA: Before she touches anything, can I let her
know that there's a whole lot of spiders on the

02:27:32.123 --> 02:27:33.393
other side of the room.

02:27:33.393 --> 02:27:34.359
MATT: You may do that.

02:27:34.359 --> 02:27:35.790
SAM: Wait, what? You didn't tell any of us that.

02:27:35.790 --> 02:27:38.485
TRAVIS: Can I shift to her right flank, just at
the corner of the mausoleum structure?

02:27:38.485 --> 02:27:39.805
Right there.

02:27:39.805 --> 02:27:43.054
LAURA: Just so everybody's aware, those things we
just fought? There's a ton more of them on the

02:27:43.054 --> 02:27:44.327
other side of this little chamber.

02:27:44.327 --> 02:27:45.688
SAM: Oh, thanks for telling us.

02:27:45.688 --> 02:27:46.584
LAURA: No problem.

02:27:46.584 --> 02:27:47.557
MATT: Grog, make a stealth check.

02:27:47.557 --> 02:27:48.968
MARISHA: (whispers) Be very quiet.

02:27:48.968 --> 02:27:51.455
TRAVIS: Oh, shit. Natural 20.

02:27:51.455 --> 02:27:53.479
(cheering)

02:27:53.479 --> 02:27:55.740
TALIESIN: Spiderman.

02:27:55.740 --> 02:27:58.124
LAURA: Good thing you took that beard off because
it had bells and shit in it.

02:27:58.124 --> 02:27:59.505
TRAVIS: Oh, the beard is still there.

02:27:59.505 --> 02:28:00.681
SAM: No, no, it fell off.

02:28:00.681 --> 02:28:02.019
TRAVIS: Its most majestic part fell off.

02:28:02.019 --> 02:28:02.943
SAM: Oh.

02:28:02.943 --> 02:28:05.134
MATT: Yeah. There's still some goliath peach fuzz
there.

02:28:05.134 --> 02:28:06.443
TRAVIS: Substantial Viking-ness happening.

02:28:06.443 --> 02:28:12.367
MATT: Grog, for a moment there, you recess into
your old hunter training when you were traveling with

02:28:12.367 --> 02:28:19.675
your barbarian tribe and you take in the darkness
around you and walk, fleet of foot, to the edge of

02:28:19.728 --> 02:28:22.775
it, not making a single sound. You're damn proud
of yourself.

02:28:22.775 --> 02:28:23.941
TRAVIS: I am.

02:28:23.941 --> 02:28:24.967
TALIESIN: (whispers) Quietly.

02:28:24.967 --> 02:28:27.243
MATT: So as you tell this to Kima, she goes,
(whispers) "What? Spiders?"

02:28:27.243 --> 02:28:30.602
LAURA: (whispers) Lots and lots of spiders. Is
that going to make noise?

02:28:30.602 --> 02:28:33.403
MATT: (whispers) "I don't know. I haven't been in
this chamber before."

02:28:33.403 --> 02:28:39.142
LAURA: Perhaps we should deal with the spiders
before we make noise, or maybe just be prepared.

02:28:39.142 --> 02:28:44.586
In fact, you know what? I'm going to cast Spike
Growth on the ground in between where they're

02:28:44.586 --> 02:28:46.071
going to have to walk through.

02:28:46.071 --> 02:28:47.640
MARISHA: Ooh, good. Smarty-pants.

02:28:47.640 --> 02:28:49.599
LAURA: Because they can't freaking see it right
now, can they?

02:28:49.599 --> 02:28:50.565
MATT: Which way?

02:28:50.565 --> 02:28:52.480
LAURA: Yeah, there, yeah.

02:28:52.480 --> 02:28:53.753
ASHLEY: Both sides?

02:28:53.753 --> 02:28:55.914
MATT: You said Spike Growth. How much does it
affect?

02:28:55.914 --> 02:29:00.732
LAURA: It affects-- damn it-- I didn't put it in
my thingy because I'm dumb. I'm sorry, I'm sorry,

02:29:00.732 --> 02:29:02.662
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm
sorry.

02:29:02.662 --> 02:29:03.695
MATT: That's okay.

02:29:03.695 --> 02:29:05.136
ORION: You're not dumb. You're a strong, smart
person.

02:29:05.136 --> 02:29:06.335
ASHLEY: While she's looking, could I--

02:29:06.335 --> 02:29:07.224
LAURA: Spike Growth!

02:29:07.224 --> 02:29:08.285
ASHLEY: You found it.

02:29:08.285 --> 02:29:09.329
TALIESIN: Way more than arrows.

02:29:09.329 --> 02:29:11.863
LAURA: It is a 20-foot radius. That's not that
much.

02:29:11.863 --> 02:29:14.471
MATT: Okay, cool. So you can do this whole area
right here is all spiky growth.

02:29:14.471 --> 02:29:16.879
LAURA: And it's hard spikes. Hard spikes and
thorns.

02:29:16.879 --> 02:29:18.049
MATT: Good to know.

02:29:18.049 --> 02:29:19.463
TALIESIN: Briar.

02:29:19.463 --> 02:29:24.476
SAM: All right, well, I'm going to follow suit and
go to the other side and cast Stinking Cloud. No, over--

02:29:24.476 --> 02:29:25.761
MATT: Over here?

02:29:25.761 --> 02:29:27.207
SAM: Over there, yeah.

02:29:27.207 --> 02:29:28.626
TRAVIS: Our side's the best!

02:29:28.626 --> 02:29:30.526
(laughter)

02:29:30.526 --> 02:29:32.459
MATT: Go ahead and make another stealth check.

02:29:32.459 --> 02:29:36.130
SAM: Okay. 15. 17!

02:29:36.130 --> 02:29:37.286
MATT: 17.

02:29:37.286 --> 02:29:39.822
SAM: That's the best stealth I've ever done.

02:29:39.894 --> 02:29:40.634
ASHLEY: Well done.

02:29:40.634 --> 02:29:41.648
TRAVIS: Yeah, buddy.

02:29:41.648 --> 02:29:44.349
MATT: You quietly come by and mutter under your
breath your arcane ritual and all of a sudden

02:29:44.349 --> 02:29:46.775
(quiet whoosh). And what was the size of the cloud
on that one?

02:29:46.775 --> 02:29:55.453
SAM: 30 feet, I think? I think it's 30 feet. Hold
on, hold on, hold on. 90 feet! Oh, that's the range.

02:29:55.453 --> 02:29:56.517
MATT: What's the radius?

02:29:56.517 --> 02:29:57.725
SAM: It's a 20-foot radius.

02:29:57.725 --> 02:29:58.789
ORION: Oh, your cards are cool!

02:29:58.789 --> 02:30:00.811
MATT: 20-foot radius, which would be-- Actually, a
20-foot radius for this would be...

02:30:00.811 --> 02:30:02.059
ORION: Nice, they have little bard thingies.

02:30:02.059 --> 02:30:03.527
MARISHA: Oh, they're purple. Mine has like a--

02:30:03.527 --> 02:30:04.377
ORION: Nice color diversity!

02:30:04.377 --> 02:30:05.568
MATT: This whole area here--

02:30:05.568 --> 02:30:06.427
LAURA: Oh, nice!

02:30:06.427 --> 02:30:07.394
ORION: (laughs) Oh, I did see this.

02:30:07.394 --> 02:30:09.062
MATT: This whole area here is done.

02:30:09.062 --> 02:30:10.331
MARISHA: I've got like a scythe.

02:30:10.331 --> 02:30:11.228
TALIESIN: A sickle.

02:30:11.228 --> 02:30:15.151
MATT: And you also now make a very nasty cloud in
this vicinity as well. This whole area is

02:30:15.220 --> 02:30:17.168
completely marked off on both sides now.

02:30:17.168 --> 02:30:23.073
ORION: I'd like to walk up as I see this going on.
I'm going to take out my deck of illusions. I'm

02:30:23.073 --> 02:30:29.712
going to toss two cards both ways, two cards on
each side. So I'm going to do this, real quick.

02:30:29.712 --> 02:30:34.230
LAURA: Question. That chamber in the center of the
room, does it go all the way to the ceiling, or is it--

02:30:34.230 --> 02:30:35.948
MATT: No, there is a gap.

02:30:35.948 --> 02:30:37.352
ORION: Deck of illusions, everyone.

02:30:37.352 --> 02:30:40.178
LAURA: So there's a huge-- so technically, the
spiders could crawl up the ceiling and drop down

02:30:40.178 --> 02:30:41.342
on us?

02:30:41.342 --> 02:30:42.544
TRAVIS: Yes.

02:30:42.544 --> 02:30:43.752
MATT: In theory?

02:30:43.752 --> 02:30:51.657
TALIESIN: Why would you give him ideas like that?
Just feed him irony!

02:30:51.873 --> 02:30:53.892
TRAVIS: Let's go.

02:30:53.892 --> 02:31:00.764
ORION: Ten of Hearts, Yes! Joker, Queen of Hearts,
and another Joker! What?!

02:31:00.764 --> 02:31:03.021
SAM: What does that mean?

02:31:03.021 --> 02:31:04.454
MATT: Wait, you threw--

02:31:04.454 --> 02:31:06.301
ORION: I put two on each side.

02:31:06.301 --> 02:31:08.131
MATT: Oh, two on each side.

02:31:08.131 --> 02:31:12.331
ORION: Yeah. So, like, two over in the spot before
all that mess over there and two are in the other mess.

02:31:12.331 --> 02:31:14.832
ASHLEY: Do you want to go one up top, just in
case?

02:31:14.832 --> 02:31:16.140
LAURA: Yeah.

02:31:16.140 --> 02:31:17.011
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:31:17.011 --> 02:31:17.978
ORION: So the Jokers--

02:31:17.978 --> 02:31:18.937
MATT: Are you.

02:31:18.937 --> 02:31:20.214
ORION: And a female version of me.

02:31:20.214 --> 02:31:21.228
LAURA: Ooh, that's awesome.

02:31:21.228 --> 02:31:23.199
MATT: All right, so a secondary Tiberius appears
right there.

02:31:23.199 --> 02:31:25.125
ORION: (falsetto) Hello, everyone.

02:31:25.125 --> 02:31:26.914
MARISHA: You know, you make a good woman.

02:31:26.914 --> 02:31:27.989
ORION: (falsetto) Tiberiosa.

02:31:27.989 --> 02:31:29.813
MATT: Female Tiberius appears over on that side.

02:31:29.813 --> 02:31:31.436
MARISHA: Tiberiosa.

02:31:31.436 --> 02:31:35.719
ORION: And then whichever side you decide, a Queen
of Hearts and Ten of Hearts.

02:31:35.719 --> 02:31:37.136
MATT: Queen of Hearts-- oh, interesting.

02:31:37.136 --> 02:31:39.326
TRAVIS: (falsetto) Levi-O-sa, not levio-SA.

02:31:39.326 --> 02:31:41.720
MATT: A succubus appears over here. Winged.

02:31:41.720 --> 02:31:42.909
MARISHA: Well, that's fun.

02:31:42.909 --> 02:31:44.475
MATT: Sorry, what was the other one that you
said?

02:31:44.475 --> 02:31:46.145
ORION: Queen of Hearts and a Ten of Hearts.

02:31:46.145 --> 02:31:49.345
MATT: Ten of Hearts. A cloud giant on this side of
the room.

02:31:49.345 --> 02:31:50.491
LAURA: What?

02:31:50.491 --> 02:31:51.565
ORION: (explosion noise)

02:31:51.565 --> 02:31:52.556
ASHLEY: Rad.

02:31:52.556 --> 02:31:55.804
MATT: We'll use that mini for now, it's fine. All
of a sudden appear, kind of translucent, their

02:31:55.804 --> 02:31:59.098
image flickering. It's not a great illusion, but
it's enough where it catches some attention.

02:31:59.098 --> 02:32:02.984
ORION: And they're positioned right before the
messes of each side.

02:32:02.984 --> 02:32:04.279
MATT: Like right there.

02:32:04.279 --> 02:32:05.541
ORION: Yeah.

02:32:05.541 --> 02:32:09.987
MATT: All righty. Kima's now sitting there like,
(whispers) "Put the key in now?"

02:32:09.987 --> 02:32:13.190
SAM: No, no, do it.

02:32:13.190 --> 02:32:14.356
TALIESIN: Yes, yes, go.

02:32:14.356 --> 02:32:15.707
MARISHA: Okay, you're good. Go for it, yeah.

02:32:15.707 --> 02:32:19.387
MATT: She puts her symbol into the recess. As it
does, the stone doors shift and there's a dull

02:32:19.387 --> 02:32:27.997
kind of creaking of the stone as it slides not
open, but into the walls, revealing an interior

02:32:27.997 --> 02:32:41.636
that is, as the light filters in, the entirety of
the wall, floor, and ceiling of this room is of

02:32:41.636 --> 02:32:47.656
the same scrolling, the same platinum/sapphire
material as the outside of the building and the

02:32:47.656 --> 02:32:52.791
box that's there, except for the design seems to
all filter in towards the center, like the center

02:32:52.791 --> 02:32:55.894
of a spiderweb. All the design coalesces to the
center point.

02:32:55.894 --> 02:32:57.614
LAURA: Had to be a spiderweb.

02:32:57.614 --> 02:33:04.385
MATT: It's not an actual spiderweb. There's a
raised dais up in the center there, about four

02:33:04.385 --> 02:33:11.816
feet wide, about a half-foot thick. Kima kind of
takes her symbol and puts it back around her neck

02:33:11.816 --> 02:33:18.817
and kind of motions like this. The two
Scalebearers begin to move down, carrying the

02:33:18.817 --> 02:33:23.433
case, looking about the rest of you like--

02:33:23.433 --> 02:33:29.761
ORION: I invisibly follow right behind the box,
still keeping my illusions in check.

02:33:29.761 --> 02:33:30.960
MATT: All right.

02:33:30.960 --> 02:33:31.854
ASHLEY: Same, same, same.

02:33:31.854 --> 02:33:32.800
MATT: Everyone holds in place?

02:33:32.800 --> 02:33:33.791
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm not going to move far away.

02:33:33.791 --> 02:33:34.604
ASHLEY: Following.

02:33:34.604 --> 02:33:35.397
TRAVIS: As you will.

02:33:35.397 --> 02:33:36.234
MARISHA: No, no, no, no.

02:33:36.234 --> 02:33:37.202
MATT: You're staying right there?

02:33:37.202 --> 02:33:41.050
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, if I held-- let me shift one
over, just so I'm not in Trinket's way. The other

02:33:41.050 --> 02:33:43.295
way. Yeah.

02:33:43.295 --> 02:33:55.379
MATT: There you go. All right, so. As they enter
the chamber, Kima enters as well, you guys filing

02:33:55.379 --> 02:33:58.972
in behind them, I need you all to make stealth
checks.

02:33:58.972 --> 02:34:00.411
TRAVIS and LAURA: Everybody?

02:34:00.411 --> 02:34:03.661
MATT: No, Tiberius, with advantage, because you're
invisible.

02:34:03.661 --> 02:34:04.776
LIAM: What kind of check?

02:34:04.776 --> 02:34:05.727
SAM: Stealth!

02:34:05.727 --> 02:34:06.595
TRAVIS: Not you.

02:34:06.595 --> 02:34:07.710
MATT: Not you, don't worry about it.

02:34:07.710 --> 02:34:08.646
ASHLEY: I don't?

02:34:08.646 --> 02:34:09.646
MATT: You do.

02:34:09.646 --> 02:34:15.933
ORION: 17.

02:34:15.933 --> 02:34:22.327
ASHLEY: Three.

02:34:22.480 --> 02:34:25.265
(laughter)

02:34:25.265 --> 02:34:27.335
SAM: Clang, clang, clang.

02:34:27.335 --> 02:34:33.042
MATT: So you step into the chamber, losing your
footing for a moment on the smooth, kind of

02:34:33.042 --> 02:34:36.342
platinum-like ridges across the ground, and you
kind of catch yourself, your plate hitting the

02:34:36.342 --> 02:34:43.673
ground with a loud (ting) sound, at which point
the two Scalebearers kind of look at you--

02:34:43.673 --> 02:34:45.491
ASHLEY: (whispers) Sorry! Sorry!

02:34:45.491 --> 02:34:50.580
MATT: With a heavy sigh, and Kima goes, "Go, go,
go!" They both step forward and take and place the

02:34:50.580 --> 02:34:55.468
box into the center of the room on top of the
dais. As they both release the chains, the box

02:34:55.468 --> 02:35:01.357
seems to levitate on its own to the center of the
room, much like how the Horn itself ascended and

02:35:01.357 --> 02:35:06.628
was kept aloft in the center of the box. The box
lifts up and slowly begins to rotate on its own.

02:35:06.628 --> 02:35:11.934
As it does, you can see the sapphire bits that are
ingrained on this box flash with a bright blue

02:35:11.934 --> 02:35:17.499
light and all of a sudden the blue energy
spreads into the ceiling and the floor of this

02:35:17.579 --> 02:35:24.375
room and all of the blue and silver veins that are
carved into this begin to glow with a similar blue

02:35:24.375 --> 02:35:25.363
light.

02:35:25.363 --> 02:35:26.210
SAM: Cool.

02:35:26.210 --> 02:35:27.012
MARISHA: Cool.

02:35:27.012 --> 02:35:28.213
ORION: I love light.

02:35:28.213 --> 02:35:29.740
MATT: At which point, the doors begin to--

02:35:29.740 --> 02:35:30.535
SAM: Which doors?

02:35:30.535 --> 02:35:32.369
MATT: The doors you guys entered this room through
begin to close.

02:35:32.369 --> 02:35:33.513
SAM: Ah, we should leave.

02:35:33.513 --> 02:35:34.690
ORION: I'm going to scootch.

02:35:34.690 --> 02:35:38.863
MATT: Yeah, you guys immediately scootch out of
the way. Kima darts off. Both of them turn around

02:35:38.863 --> 02:35:40.073
and start running back.

02:35:40.073 --> 02:35:42.211
SAM: (whispers) They're going to die.

02:35:42.211 --> 02:35:43.982
MATT: They both make it out.

02:35:43.982 --> 02:35:45.166
ASHLEY: Oh! That's good.

02:35:45.166 --> 02:35:49.018
MATT: They both manage to just squeeze through
real fast as the doors slam behind.

02:35:49.018 --> 02:35:50.677
MARISHA: That would be terrifying.

02:35:50.677 --> 02:35:58.590
MATT: At which point, you see a series of spiders
beginning to try to cut around-- these here,

02:35:58.590 --> 02:36:00.466
what's the DC on your--

02:36:00.466 --> 02:36:02.380
SAM: My spell?

02:36:02.380 --> 02:36:03.378
MATT: Your spell, yeah.

02:36:03.378 --> 02:36:05.913
SAM: 17, because I didn't do it through the hand
cone.

02:36:05.913 --> 02:36:06.641
MATT: Yeah.

02:36:06.641 --> 02:36:07.675
LAURA: (whispers) Why?

02:36:07.675 --> 02:36:08.697
MARISHA: Should we run?

02:36:08.697 --> 02:36:12.655
MATT: Both of these spiders get disoriented and
try to find their way through the Stinking Cloud,

02:36:12.655 --> 02:36:14.560
kind of like (choking, clicking noises).

02:36:14.560 --> 02:36:16.420
MARISHA: Yeah, who's going to be back down here,
theoretically.

02:36:16.420 --> 02:36:17.855
ORION: The guards could come back.

02:36:17.855 --> 02:36:19.675
MATT: None of them make their way through. The
rest of these begin coming forward-- what's the

02:36:19.675 --> 02:36:21.225
roll they have to make for the Spiky Growth?

02:36:21.225 --> 02:36:22.155
LAURA: 14.

02:36:22.155 --> 02:36:24.057
TALIESIN: To repair the room that we broke,
anyway.

02:36:24.057 --> 02:36:26.299
MATT: 14. Both missed their save. What's the
damage on that?

02:36:26.299 --> 02:36:30.192
LAURA: That's 2d4 for every five feet crossed.

02:36:30.192 --> 02:36:34.735
MATT: They would probably be skittering around
here halfway through before they changed

02:36:34.735 --> 02:36:37.139
trajectory, so-- 1d4, 2d4?

02:36:37.139 --> 02:36:38.806
LAURA: 2d4 for every five feet.

02:36:38.806 --> 02:36:44.047
MATT: So 10d4 each.

02:36:44.047 --> 02:36:46.060
MARISHA: Nice!

02:36:46.060 --> 02:36:48.299
MATT: They come charging around the corner rapidly
(skittering noises).

02:36:48.299 --> 02:36:49.800
MARISHA: 10d4? That's cool.

02:36:49.800 --> 02:36:51.067
ORION: Oh, nice, what?

02:36:51.067 --> 02:36:52.366
MARISHA: For her thorns.

02:36:52.366 --> 02:36:53.889
ORION: (whispers) Sweet, thorns.

02:36:53.889 --> 02:36:59.608
MARISHA: My little sister once fell into a rose
bush.

02:36:59.608 --> 02:37:00.825
SAM: Good story.

02:37:00.825 --> 02:37:02.192
MARISHA: It was very painful.

02:37:02.192 --> 02:37:04.162
ORION: Good story? (laughs)

02:37:04.162 --> 02:37:06.535
I once fell into a fire ant hill.

02:37:06.535 --> 02:37:08.907
MARISHA: That sucks, too.

02:37:08.907 --> 02:37:11.660
ORION: It was very painful. I was riding my bike.
It sucked.

02:37:11.660 --> 02:37:12.699
LAURA: 22.

02:37:12.699 --> 02:37:17.906
MATT: 22. Both of these spiders stop in place,
looking severely messed up and damaged and just

02:37:17.906 --> 02:37:22.627
kind of hold their ground, looking very confused.
You see, crawling up over the top of this

02:37:22.627 --> 02:37:32.589
structure, one large white and bluish spider that
leaps up. As this is happening, you guys are

02:37:32.589 --> 02:37:37.640
noticing that blue energy is cracking through the
floor and now following the pattern across the

02:37:37.701 --> 02:37:40.111
entirety of the structure. It crawls up the
walls--

02:37:40.111 --> 02:37:41.127
MARISHA: Oh.

02:37:41.127 --> 02:37:43.685
MATT: -- and that blue energy reaches to the
ceiling and illuminates it. And what you missed

02:37:43.685 --> 02:37:50.214
when you entered the room is you can see, recessed
into the ceiling of this room, four large humanoid

02:37:50.214 --> 02:37:55.774
entities that are just currently held aloft,
buried in the ceiling, of platinum armor.

02:37:55.774 --> 02:37:56.868
ORION: Go.

02:37:56.868 --> 02:37:58.048
TRAVIS: We've got to go. We've got to go.

02:37:58.048 --> 02:38:02.919
MATT: One of them suddenly flashes, dislodges, and
(whoosh, thud), squashing the spider in the

02:38:03.085 --> 02:38:04.073
process.

02:38:04.073 --> 02:38:05.752
(yelling)

02:38:05.752 --> 02:38:06.867
MARISHA: What is that?

02:38:06.867 --> 02:38:09.869
MATT: Just (spider screech, croak) screeching
sound, the spider slowly tries to curl in place,

02:38:09.869 --> 02:38:15.798
the giant platinum golem now slamming on top and
squishing on top. You see as it slowly comes to

02:38:15.798 --> 02:38:23.826
stand, each hand holding these giant platinum
cleavers. You suddenly hear a voice ringing

02:38:23.826 --> 02:38:27.992
through your heads collectively: "Get out."

02:38:27.992 --> 02:38:29.328
LAURA: (whispers) We should get out!

02:38:29.328 --> 02:38:32.669
ORION: You heard the man! You heard him! You heard
him! The earrings, everybody heard him.

02:38:32.669 --> 02:38:35.953
SAM: Wait, can we just leave the thing here with
the golem?

02:38:35.953 --> 02:38:38.363
LAURA: Golems are meant to protect.

02:38:38.363 --> 02:38:39.786
ORION: It's going to kill everything there.

02:38:39.786 --> 02:38:40.784
SAM: Oh, then let's go.

02:38:40.784 --> 02:38:41.740
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:38:41.740 --> 02:38:44.085
MATT: All right, so all of you guys start bolting
out. I want everyone to go ahead and make a

02:38:44.085 --> 02:38:45.265
dexterity check.

02:38:45.265 --> 02:38:48.877
MARISHA: Okay. Yeah, sure.

02:38:48.877 --> 02:38:54.202
ORION: 13.

02:38:54.202 --> 02:38:56.549
MATT: All right, anyone lower than a ten?

02:38:56.549 --> 02:38:58.025
TRAVIS: What about on a ten?

02:38:58.025 --> 02:38:58.860
MARISHA: No.

02:38:58.860 --> 02:39:00.618
MATT: Lower than a ten?

02:39:00.618 --> 02:39:02.242
ORION: (quietly) We all got above ten?

02:39:02.242 --> 02:39:03.142
MATT: Anyone?

02:39:03.142 --> 02:39:04.374
All right. You as well?

02:39:04.374 --> 02:39:05.185
ASHLEY: 14.

02:39:05.185 --> 02:39:05.980
MATT: Awesome.

02:39:05.980 --> 02:39:06.861
(laughter)

02:39:06.861 --> 02:39:07.893
ORION: Even Pike!

02:39:07.893 --> 02:39:10.295
MATT: You guys all come darting out of the room,
except for Kima, who rolls a one.

02:39:10.295 --> 02:39:12.091
So all of you guys come running out of the
room--

02:39:12.158 --> 02:39:13.090
SAM: Kima's dead.

02:39:13.090 --> 02:39:14.032
MARISHA: Kima?

02:39:14.032 --> 02:39:18.060
MATT: The rest of the Scalebearers come rushing
out, they're no longer encumbered by the box.

02:39:18.060 --> 02:39:21.807
Kima's kind of helping everyone get by, trying to
keep everyone at bay, being the hero. As she turns

02:39:21.807 --> 02:39:27.984
around, the first one comes leaping off of the
structure, runs towards her and gives one giant

02:39:27.984 --> 02:39:30.578
sweep with one of its blades.

02:39:30.578 --> 02:39:40.245
Ooh, yeah, that'll hit. You see the blade
streak across the front of her silver armor. She

02:39:40.245 --> 02:39:48.079
takes 24 points of slashing damage. It sends her
flying back ten feet with the sheer force of it,

02:39:48.079 --> 02:39:53.229
but she manages to roll out of it, yeah! With an
acrobatics check, catching herself to her feet and

02:39:53.229 --> 02:39:54.898
just keeps bolting behind the rest of you guys.

02:39:54.898 --> 02:39:56.107
LAURA: Can I see?

02:39:56.107 --> 02:40:00.270
MATT: You now see behind two more (crash, crash)
dislodging from the ceiling as the one that's

02:40:00.270 --> 02:40:03.405
charging after you is coming up the stairway.
Through this, we're now going into a skill

02:40:03.405 --> 02:40:04.863
challenge as you guys are rushing out.

02:40:04.863 --> 02:40:05.637
LAURA: Oh, god.

02:40:05.637 --> 02:40:06.560
TRAVIS: Must go faster. Must go faster.

02:40:06.560 --> 02:40:07.352
SAM: Skill challenge.

02:40:07.352 --> 02:40:08.384
MARISHA: Skill challenge!

02:40:08.384 --> 02:40:09.428
ASHLEY: Ah, go, go!

02:40:09.428 --> 02:40:10.508
ORION: Yeah, all right. Run for your life.

02:40:10.508 --> 02:40:11.375
MARISHA: We haven't done this in a while.

02:40:11.375 --> 02:40:12.565
MATT: Now, as you're running to get through,
there's still bits of webbing still in the way. I

02:40:12.565 --> 02:40:14.577
need everyone to go ahead and make another
dexterity check.

02:40:14.577 --> 02:40:15.615
SAM: All right, doing good.

02:40:15.615 --> 02:40:16.544
ORION: Yes!

02:40:16.544 --> 02:40:17.658
TALIESIN: Yeah!

02:40:17.658 --> 02:40:19.776
MARISHA: Oh, okay, yeah, yeah, sure.

02:40:19.776 --> 02:40:20.685
ORION: 21!

02:40:20.685 --> 02:40:21.593
LAURA: 25.

02:40:21.593 --> 02:40:22.409
TALIESIN: 22.

02:40:22.409 --> 02:40:23.252
TRAVIS: 21.

02:40:23.252 --> 02:40:24.252
LIAM: 26.

02:40:24.252 --> 02:40:25.060
ASHLEY: 17?

02:40:25.060 --> 02:40:25.872
MARISHA: 11?

02:40:25.872 --> 02:40:26.810
TALIESIN: 22.

02:40:26.810 --> 02:40:27.564
MATT: All right.

02:40:27.564 --> 02:40:28.553
SAM: 19.

02:40:28.553 --> 02:40:34.043
MATT: All right, as you guys are all charging up,
kind of helping each other but also clamoring to

02:40:34.043 --> 02:40:38.239
get through, Kima is rushing up and you can see
where one of the Scalebearers has now tripped and

02:40:38.303 --> 02:40:39.451
fallen on the stairs.

02:40:39.451 --> 02:40:40.445
SAM: Oh, no!

02:40:40.445 --> 02:40:42.744
MATT: She runs past, leans back to reach her hand
out as the golem comes up behind--

02:40:42.744 --> 02:40:43.655
MARISHA: No!

02:40:43.655 --> 02:40:45.738
MATT: -- with two hands, swings down with both
blades.

02:40:45.738 --> 02:40:46.885
SAM: Against Kima again?

02:40:46.885 --> 02:40:48.175
MATT: No, this is against one of the
Scalebearers.

02:40:48.175 --> 02:40:48.844
SAM: Oh, okay.

02:40:48.844 --> 02:40:49.735
TALIESIN: Oh no.

02:40:49.735 --> 02:40:50.830
LAURA: Should I be rolling for Trinket?

02:40:50.830 --> 02:40:52.151
MATT: I'm considering Trinket with you, so no.

02:40:52.151 --> 02:40:53.160
MARISHA: Too late, just leave them.

02:40:53.160 --> 02:40:54.336
LAURA: Okay, thank you.

02:40:54.336 --> 02:40:57.144
MATT: We'll do that next round because I forgot.
There's a lot of things to consider. One of them

02:40:57.144 --> 02:41:00.806
hits the stone and just streaks off, sparks flying
through the air, illuminating the space

02:41:00.806 --> 02:41:09.705
secondarily. However, the other Scalebearer takes
28 points of slashing damage from the blow. As it

02:41:09.705 --> 02:41:14.591
reaches up again for a second blow, Kima reaches
down and grabs Desona's arm and lifts her up off

02:41:14.591 --> 02:41:18.217
her feet and they both go charging forward. You
guys make your way up the stairway as you see now

02:41:18.217 --> 02:41:19.739
the golem pushing its way through.

02:41:19.739 --> 02:41:24.779
ORION: I'm going to dissipate my card illusion and
I'm going to cast Fly on myself, so I'm hovering.

02:41:24.779 --> 02:41:26.203
MATT: Okay.

02:41:26.203 --> 02:41:31.790
MARISHA: How much of a gap is there between the
last trailing-behind Scalebearer and the golem?

02:41:31.842 --> 02:41:36.446
MATT: Well, now that Kima's got them, they're
rushing up and there's about a ten-foot, 15-foot

02:41:36.446 --> 02:41:37.251
gap now.

02:41:37.251 --> 02:41:38.178
LAURA: Okay.

02:41:38.178 --> 02:41:39.713
MARISHA: I'm going to turn around and do Wall of
Stone. Boof!

02:41:39.713 --> 02:41:44.099
MATT: Okay. As they rush past, a wall of stone
slams up as the golem goes smashing into it--

02:41:44.366 --> 02:41:47.768
ORION: I'll do support. I'll do Obelisk right
behind it, too.

02:41:47.768 --> 02:41:53.530
MATT: All right. So as you guys come rushing up to
the top of this, you guys are just doing the stone

02:41:53.530 --> 02:41:57.245
wall, obelisk, obelisk, obelisk. We'll say you
cast it twice to go ahead and reinforce.

02:41:57.245 --> 02:41:58.806
MARISHA: Boof!

02:41:58.806 --> 02:42:03.750
MATT: All right, you hear the impact from behind.
You hear stone crack and break and you see two of

02:42:03.750 --> 02:42:08.766
the pillars that you put up impact, dust and bits
of rock shoot out, but it settles. Apparently it's

02:42:08.766 --> 02:42:11.843
holding strong and you start hearing slamming of
some sort of heavy weight behind it.

02:42:11.843 --> 02:42:13.031
MARISHA: Right, run.

02:42:13.031 --> 02:42:16.402
MATT: As well as the following of additional giant
heavy footsteps. It's now got its reinforcements

02:42:16.402 --> 02:42:19.166
caught up to it. You guys charge into the room
with the broken trap, which now has

02:42:19.166 --> 02:42:23.049
partially raised platforms. You're rushing around
and trying to find your way through. You get to

02:42:23.211 --> 02:42:26.881
the other side of the room. There's now an
entirety-- a room filled with mist in front of you.

02:42:26.942 --> 02:42:28.179
LAURA: (gasps) Oh no.

02:42:28.179 --> 02:42:32.875
MARISHA: I still have it. I can Gust of
Wind. That's my last 3rd-level spell.

02:42:33.031 --> 02:42:35.508
MATT: Okay. All right, Gust of Wind. I'm going to
ask all of you guys to make a wisdom check as you

02:42:35.508 --> 02:42:36.779
rush through.

02:42:36.779 --> 02:42:37.962
MARISHA: Including me?

02:42:37.962 --> 02:42:38.825
MATT: Everyone.

02:42:38.825 --> 02:42:40.143
SAM: Wisdom check or saving throw?

02:42:40.143 --> 02:42:41.416
MATT: This is a wisdom check.

02:42:41.416 --> 02:42:45.741
MARISHA: Just adding your wisdom?

02:42:45.741 --> 02:42:47.039
ASHLEY: Natural 20!

02:42:47.039 --> 02:42:48.101
LAURA: What what!

02:42:48.101 --> 02:42:49.058
MATT: Nice!

02:42:49.058 --> 02:42:49.911
ASHLEY: 24.

02:42:49.911 --> 02:42:51.673
MARISHA: Saving throw or just your ability
modifier?

02:42:51.673 --> 02:42:52.462
ORION: 12.

02:42:52.462 --> 02:42:53.361
MATT: Ability modifier.

02:42:53.361 --> 02:42:54.271
TALIESIN: Oh.

02:42:54.271 --> 02:42:55.278
MARISHA: Okay, 16.

02:42:55.278 --> 02:42:56.413
ORION: I thought it was negative three.

02:42:56.413 --> 02:42:58.300
SAM: Ten. Ten for me.

02:42:58.300 --> 02:42:59.225
TALIESIN: 14.

02:42:59.225 --> 02:43:00.302
LAURA: 13.

02:43:00.302 --> 02:43:01.234
LIAM: Nine.

02:43:01.234 --> 02:43:02.145
TRAVIS: Two.

02:43:02.145 --> 02:43:03.230
SAM: Nine, wow.

02:43:03.230 --> 02:43:10.253
MATT: All of you guys are pushing through. So, as
you guys come rushing in you're like, go go! You

02:43:10.253 --> 02:43:14.608
see Keyleth's focusing and getting the wind to
escape, Keyleth rushes up, Kima comes through with

02:43:14.608 --> 02:43:18.025
the two Scalebearers, everyone comes through,
Grog's bringing up the back. You can see now, in

02:43:18.025 --> 02:43:24.414
the back behind him, a giant blade-wielding fist
as the golem comes smashing through the wall. The

02:43:24.414 --> 02:43:28.866
rest of you guys, ushering Grog along, Grog comes
running, hears the sound, looks over his shoulder

02:43:28.866 --> 02:43:34.858
and in the chaos of it, his trajectory is off and
he ends up brushing into the side of the mist.

02:43:34.858 --> 02:43:36.288
LAURA: Oh, no!

02:43:36.288 --> 02:43:38.205
MATT: Grog, go ahead and make a dexterity saving
throw.

02:43:38.205 --> 02:43:40.382
TRAVIS: 12.

02:43:40.382 --> 02:43:47.381
MATT: You end up taking 24 points of fire damage
as the pillars spin, unleashing a torrent of flame.

02:43:47.381 --> 02:43:49.348
TRAVIS: No, bad car wash, bad car wash!

02:43:49.348 --> 02:43:51.111
MARISHA: (laughs) Bad car wash.

02:43:51.111 --> 02:43:53.592
LAURA: Oh, no, Grog, your beard has been singed.

02:43:53.592 --> 02:43:54.313
ORION: Oh!

02:43:54.313 --> 02:43:55.269
TRAVIS: What?

02:43:55.269 --> 02:43:57.590
(laughter)

02:43:57.590 --> 02:44:01.991
MATT: You reach up instinctively, you feel it's as
smooth as a baby goliath's face.

02:44:01.993 --> 02:44:03.300
(laughter)

02:44:03.300 --> 02:44:06.133
ORION: All that work!

02:44:06.133 --> 02:44:08.411
MATT: As you guys charge up the rest of the
staircase--

02:44:08.411 --> 02:44:10.042
ORION: Is Grog behind us now, like the furthest
away?

02:44:10.042 --> 02:44:13.461
MATT: He's just caught up to you guys as you're
rushing up the staircase. You get to the final

02:44:13.461 --> 02:44:19.309
door. You exit. As Kima rushes everyone through,
she brings out her holy symbol real fast, and as

02:44:19.309 --> 02:44:24.578
she pulls it off her neck, you see the first golem
reach the bottom of the staircase. It begins

02:44:24.578 --> 02:44:25.503
looming up--

02:44:25.503 --> 02:44:26.773
ORION: We're leaving! What are you doing?!

02:44:26.773 --> 02:44:29.502
MARISHA: Yeah, go home! Go home! Bad golem.

02:44:29.502 --> 02:44:30.488
TALIESIN: I take a--

02:44:30.488 --> 02:44:33.684
MATT: Kima takes out her holy symbol and holds it
aloft in front of her and says under her breath

02:44:33.684 --> 02:44:40.505
(murmurs), at which point it begins to glow with
this extremely vibrant glow. As it does, you see a

02:44:40.505 --> 02:44:46.074
symbol emblazoned on the front of the golem and it
flashes with light as it stops and just kind of

02:44:46.074 --> 02:44:50.930
holds its place-- and waits. And Kima looks at the
symbol like "I wasn't sure that was going to

02:44:50.930 --> 02:44:53.512
"work." She takes--

02:44:53.512 --> 02:44:55.298
ORION: Tell it to go kill the spider.

02:44:55.298 --> 02:45:00.199
MATT: She takes the symbol and puts it back in the
side of the stone door that originally was closed.

02:45:00.199 --> 02:45:06.661
The doors slowly seal shut once again. She pulls
the symbol out-- and she falls to her knees,

02:45:06.661 --> 02:45:07.956
breathing heavily.

02:45:07.956 --> 02:45:09.352
SAM: Oh, Kima.

02:45:09.352 --> 02:45:10.451
MARISHA: We did it!

02:45:10.451 --> 02:45:11.980
TRAVIS: Next time, lead with that.

02:45:11.980 --> 02:45:15.439
ORION: I agree, Grog. Very well said.

02:45:15.439 --> 02:45:17.580
MATT: "It kind of happened very quickly, I'm
sorry."

02:45:17.580 --> 02:45:20.343
ASHLEY: All right, do some people need to be
healed?

02:45:20.343 --> 02:45:21.347
TALIESIN: Oh, dear.

02:45:21.347 --> 02:45:22.255
LAURA: Yeah.

02:45:22.255 --> 02:45:23.154
SAM: Kima, for sure.

02:45:23.154 --> 02:45:24.000
ORION: I'm actually okay.

02:45:24.000 --> 02:45:24.990
MARISHA: I'm all right. I'm all right.

02:45:24.990 --> 02:45:25.859
TALIESIN: I'm fine.

02:45:25.859 --> 02:45:26.853
SAM: Oh, Grog's got a burnt face.

02:45:26.853 --> 02:45:29.258
TRAVIS: No, I want to wear this pain as a
remembrance of my beard.

02:45:29.258 --> 02:45:31.683
LAURA: You can grow it back, Grog.

02:45:31.683 --> 02:45:32.867
ORION: It's okay, big fella.

02:45:32.867 --> 02:45:38.199
MATT: You make your way back up to the main
chamber, where High Bearer Vord is currently

02:45:38.199 --> 02:45:39.317
waiting for you.

02:45:39.317 --> 02:45:40.375
SAM: Oh, this guy.

02:45:40.375 --> 02:45:47.186
MATT: He turns to you as you enter. "So I am to
assume that your journey was a success?"

02:45:47.186 --> 02:45:53.582
ORION: Yes, surprisingly so. It went off without a
hitch. Well, no.

02:45:53.582 --> 02:45:55.362
LAURA: You've got some good security down there.

02:45:55.362 --> 02:45:56.462
MARISHA: Very good.

02:45:56.462 --> 02:46:00.457
MATT: "I told you. Once it's instilled, it will be
safe."

02:46:00.457 --> 02:46:02.825
LAURA: A little warning next time would be great.

02:46:02.825 --> 02:46:04.454
ASHLEY: 25 points of healing.

02:46:04.454 --> 02:46:05.756
MATT: There you go.

02:46:05.756 --> 02:46:07.402
ORION: You're really a girl on fire now.

02:46:07.402 --> 02:46:09.220
MARISHA: That really heals me up, then.

02:46:09.220 --> 02:46:11.221
TALIESIN: That will top me off very nicely.

02:46:11.221 --> 02:46:12.516
MARISHA: I'll take that.

02:46:12.516 --> 02:46:15.392
ORION: Well done, everyone, by the way.

02:46:15.392 --> 02:46:16.566
LAURA: Yeah.

02:46:16.566 --> 02:46:17.641
TALIESIN: That could've gone worse.

02:46:17.641 --> 02:46:18.898
MARISHA: It could have gone worse.

02:46:19.038 --> 02:46:25.381
MATT: At which point, the High Bearer Vord kind of
raises his hand. "Yonn, if you do not mind." And

02:46:25.381 --> 02:46:26.924
Yonn kind of shuffles forward.

02:46:26.924 --> 02:46:27.775
SAM: Yonn.

02:46:27.775 --> 02:46:29.167
ORION: Such a bore.

02:46:29.167 --> 02:46:30.191
MARISHA: Yawn.

02:46:30.191 --> 02:46:31.871
MATT: "Excuse me, I'm right here."

02:46:31.871 --> 02:46:35.081
ORION: It was a play on words. Your name also
means something that you do when you're tired.

02:46:35.081 --> 02:46:37.234
MARISHA: Yeah!

02:46:37.234 --> 02:46:39.016
MATT: "I don't like you."

02:46:39.016 --> 02:46:40.228
(laughter)

02:46:40.228 --> 02:46:42.127
MATT: He reaches out and puts a big old sack of
coins in your hands.

02:46:42.191 --> 02:46:45.206
LAURA: Oh! I'll hold onto that.

02:46:45.206 --> 02:46:46.297
ORION: Of course.

02:46:46.297 --> 02:46:49.228
TALIESIN: We should mention, you may have to have
one of the rooms repaired.

02:46:49.389 --> 02:46:50.640
ORION: I take a couple out.

02:46:50.640 --> 02:46:54.191
TALIESIN: The spinning column--

02:46:54.191 --> 02:46:56.307
SAM: Circle of death.

02:46:56.307 --> 02:46:57.436
LAURA: Yeah.

02:46:57.436 --> 02:46:58.775
TALIESIN: May have gotten--

02:46:58.775 --> 02:47:03.260
LAURA: A little broken. We thought were maybe just
disarming it but I think we probably broke it.

02:47:03.260 --> 02:47:04.618
TALIESIN: We put an arrow into it.

02:47:04.618 --> 02:47:07.757
TRAVIS: (tearfully) If you find the remnants of a
glorious beard, preserve it.

02:47:07.757 --> 02:47:09.435
LAURA: Oh, Grog, actually--

02:47:09.435 --> 02:47:10.572
TRAVIS: What?

02:47:10.572 --> 02:47:13.186
LAURA: I've got some remnants of a lovely beard.

02:47:13.237 --> 02:47:15.320
And I try to smush it onto his chin.

02:47:15.320 --> 02:47:17.075
TRAVIS: It is not the same.

02:47:17.075 --> 02:47:18.443
MATT: It is not the same.

02:47:18.443 --> 02:47:19.843
LAURA: It looks pretty good.

02:47:19.843 --> 02:47:20.929
MATT: It is not the same.

02:47:20.929 --> 02:47:22.019
LAURA: Dang it.

02:47:22.019 --> 02:47:29.872
MATT: At which point, the High Bearer turns to
you, Pike. "Mighty cleric, I see this meeting,

02:47:29.872 --> 02:47:36.267
"though it escaped my vision before, that you bear
the holy sigil of the Dawnflower, the Lady of

02:47:36.317 --> 02:47:43.718
"Redemption Herself. While we may walk under
different stars, I offer these words that caught

02:47:43.718 --> 02:47:50.772
"my ear naught but a week ago. In an excavation
beneath the toppled tower of Syrac, the

02:47:50.772 --> 02:47:57.254
"long-cursed ruin that sat like a blemish upon this
city for hundreds of years, it was revealed that

02:47:57.254 --> 02:48:04.750
"perhaps the five holy paths that began here at
Vasselheim, there may indeed now be a sixth."

02:48:04.750 --> 02:48:06.285
SAM: What?

02:48:06.285 --> 02:48:13.077
MATT: "A forgotten temple to Sarenrae has been
uncovered. Crumbled, lost, and without light, it

02:48:13.077 --> 02:48:19.637
"sat, forever and a day, and few are around in this
city of her guiding flame to recover and restore

02:48:19.637 --> 02:48:23.142
"its glory. Perhaps you should look into it."

02:48:23.142 --> 02:48:26.209
ASHLEY: I will gladly look into it.

02:48:26.209 --> 02:48:31.740
MATT: "The ruin lies to the west of here, at the
base of the city's mountain. Look for the dark

02:48:31.740 --> 02:48:38.762
"stone ruin. Nevertheless, I thank you for your
time. Kima, if you wouldn't mind, we have some

02:48:38.762 --> 02:48:40.506
"things to discuss as well."

02:48:40.506 --> 02:48:43.577
MARISHA: Oh, quick, Vorg--

02:48:43.577 --> 02:48:48.249
MATT: "Vord. High Bearer Vord."

02:48:48.249 --> 02:48:49.231
MARISHA: Vord.

02:48:49.231 --> 02:48:50.306
TALIESIN: Vord.

02:48:50.306 --> 02:48:51.450
LAURA: Highbearer Vord.

02:48:51.450 --> 02:48:52.773
MATT: "Was that so hard? Yes?"

02:48:52.773 --> 02:49:03.932
MARISHA: Vord? You wouldn't have happened to hear
of maybe a druid tribe called the Fire Ashari?

02:49:03.932 --> 02:49:11.887
They call their little hometown Pyrah. Do you
happen to know, maybe?

02:49:11.887 --> 02:49:19.657
MATT: He gives you a keen look and says, "There
has been talk of a rogue band of druids, not more

02:49:19.719 --> 02:49:25.722
"than two day's travel, in the-- let's see, where
did I put the maps here?" He thinks to himself for

02:49:25.722 --> 02:49:33.964
a moment, considering it. "Towards the Sunder Peak
Mountain Range. Dangerous territory, fraught with

02:49:33.964 --> 02:49:38.072
"volcanic activity. Yet these folks seem to call
it home."

02:49:38.127 --> 02:49:43.884
MARISHA: Is Sunder Peak like west or east to where
we--

02:49:43.884 --> 02:49:46.335
MATT: "Southwest of the city. It's hard to miss."

02:49:46.335 --> 02:49:47.475
MARISHA: Southwest.

02:49:47.475 --> 02:49:50.017
MATT: "Look for the plumes of sulfurous smoke."

02:49:50.017 --> 02:49:52.473
LAURA: Is the temple to Sarenrae on the way to
the--

02:49:52.473 --> 02:49:56.323
MATT: "The temple to Sarenrae is on the same
mountain that this temple is built on."

02:49:56.323 --> 02:49:57.383
LAURA: Oh.

02:49:57.383 --> 02:49:59.356
MATT: "To the west of here. Follow the mountain
base."

02:49:59.356 --> 02:50:01.246
MARISHA: Oh. So we can stop there first?

02:50:01.246 --> 02:50:03.131
ORION: Yes, it's close, it seems.

02:50:03.131 --> 02:50:04.759
LAURA: All of us can--

02:50:04.759 --> 02:50:14.984
ORION: Before we part, you seem to be quite
learned about many things that I am not. Have you

02:50:14.984 --> 02:50:22.157
ever heard of anything called the God's Hammer or
the Pale Stone? Or any particular artifact, Ropes

02:50:22.157 --> 02:50:24.621
of Mercy, perhaps?

02:50:24.621 --> 02:50:26.686
MATT: "I can't say I have, unfortunately."

02:50:26.686 --> 02:50:27.830
ORION: Of course.

02:50:27.830 --> 02:50:30.422
MATT: "But I shall keep this in mind, should the
information come my way."

02:50:30.422 --> 02:50:32.710
ORION: Thank you. I bow.

02:50:32.710 --> 02:50:43.638
MATT: He gives you a look, a quick glance, and
notes: "For the record, while your color is not

02:50:43.638 --> 02:50:52.589
"what it was when you first entered, know that the
great Platinum Dragon sees through this guise to

02:50:52.589 --> 02:50:54.427
"the heart beneath."

02:50:54.427 --> 02:51:00.099
ORION: Yes, thank you for noticing. I agree with
the same sentiment. And I bow in the Draconic

02:51:00.099 --> 02:51:01.891
fashion.

02:51:01.891 --> 02:51:09.007
MATT: "Well, Kima. Business. Thank you all very
much." And he kind of lends his hands out. As he

02:51:09.007 --> 02:51:13.129
extends his hand, the doors on the opposite side of
the room open up.

02:51:13.192 --> 02:51:15.710
LAURA: Magic. Thought it was banned.

02:51:15.710 --> 02:51:19.708
MATT: For the sake of brevity, because we have
people who have to leave on this, very soon, it

02:51:19.708 --> 02:51:27.461
doesn't take you long to find your way across the
city. You find some of the city's Bastions

02:51:27.461 --> 02:51:33.213
standing guard on the outskirts of this crumpled
tower ruin. It's like, black and soot-covered

02:51:33.213 --> 02:51:39.361
stone that looks like a plot of land that has been
left untouched. Like, once it fell, no one wanted

02:51:39.361 --> 02:51:44.161
anything to do with it. You speak with the
Bastions and they eventually let you through,

02:51:44.161 --> 02:51:51.462
especially given the aid of those you've walked
with since arrival. You come to the ruin and you

02:51:51.462 --> 02:51:57.211
can see there's about a 40-foot gap in this pile
of stone that is a recess in the ground, almost

02:51:57.211 --> 02:52:03.005
like a small sinkhole. It looks like there is some
sort of excavation that has been set here. Very

02:52:03.005 --> 02:52:08.406
haphazard. There is very simple wood boards that
have been placed into the side of this small

02:52:08.406 --> 02:52:16.939
sinkhole to allow relatively comfortable, though a bit
rickety, descent into the structure. As you make

02:52:17.004 --> 02:52:22.705
your way down, your eyes adjust to the little bit
of daylight that spills into this dark

02:52:22.705 --> 02:52:31.076
subterranean cavern. There before you, you see a
surprisingly glorious sight: a simple structure of

02:52:31.076 --> 02:52:38.347
brass and polished limestone, ancient as the day
is long. One of the walls has partially collapsed,

02:52:38.347 --> 02:52:44.239
and you see what looks like three figures
rummaging through the debris. An older human

02:52:44.239 --> 02:52:48.762
woman, who is being helped by two others: a young
man of blond hair and simple clothes and an older

02:52:48.762 --> 02:52:54.398
gnome that's carrying a crutch under his arm.
They're all in the process of collecting and

02:52:54.398 --> 02:53:01.262
setting aside and cleaning up various things that
have been recovered from this temple. You

02:53:01.262 --> 02:53:10.314
immediately see against the brass structure the
very simplified symbol of the wings of Sarenrae,

02:53:10.314 --> 02:53:17.850
multiple times across the structure in various
incarnations. This is very much indeed a lost

02:53:17.850 --> 02:53:19.414
temple of Sarenrae.

02:53:19.414 --> 02:53:21.234
LAURA: (whispers) Wow, Pike.

02:53:21.234 --> 02:53:22.795
ASHLEY: (whispers) Wow.

02:53:22.795 --> 02:53:27.128
SAM: So, when you've fully excavated it, you can
come back and check it out.

02:53:27.297 --> 02:53:28.218
ASHLEY: Yes...

02:53:28.218 --> 02:53:31.626
ORION: Or you can stay here and restore it.

02:53:31.626 --> 02:53:36.326
MATT: At which point, the older woman sees you
guys walk down and says, "Please! There's nothing

02:53:36.326 --> 02:53:40.129
"to take. Nothing but history and rock, I guarantee
you. Bandits are not welcome here."

02:53:40.129 --> 02:53:44.370
ASHLEY: No no no! I take out my symbol and I say,
no no no, I'm here to help.

02:53:44.370 --> 02:53:52.635
MATT: You can hear an audible gasp from her. She
says, "My eyes don't deceive. Oh my, I am sorry.

02:53:52.635 --> 02:54:00.250
"My name is Gesyra, a simple painter, but one of,
as far as I know, the three devoted to the Lady of

02:54:00.456 --> 02:54:09.399
"the Everlight here in Vasselheim. And now a
fourth. I don't know where you came from, but

02:54:09.463 --> 02:54:17.213
"would you stay with us for a bit and help us
rebuild? Bring her name into the light amongst the

02:54:17.213 --> 02:54:21.107
"others here in Vasselheim? Restore it to its
glory?"

02:54:21.107 --> 02:54:28.726
ASHLEY: (tearfully) Yes. Oh, man, I don't want to
leave you guys.

02:54:28.726 --> 02:54:34.952
MATT: "It shouldn't take long, especially with
your help. And we can bring the light into the

02:54:34.952 --> 02:54:39.186
"heart of others." And you can see the two other
kind of joined her at the side and they all look at you with

02:54:39.186 --> 02:54:43.150
this look of hope that you can probably tell from
the crinkles in their face they haven't had in

02:54:43.213 --> 02:54:49.152
quite some time. And they look up to you in their
simple clothes as the first true strong bastion

02:54:49.152 --> 02:54:56.297
for Sarenrae that they've seen in a long time.
With that, Pike, you get to turn to the rest of

02:54:56.297 --> 02:54:57.971
the group.

02:54:57.971 --> 02:55:07.514
ASHLEY: Well, I think this is a pilgrimage I have
to take. So, Vox Machina, keep your eyes out. I

02:55:07.514 --> 02:55:18.800
will contact you every once in a while if I can,
and we will meet up once this is completed. All in.

02:55:18.800 --> 02:55:20.706
TRAVIS: Right.

02:55:20.706 --> 02:55:24.219
ASHLEY: Vox Machina on three. One, two, three.

02:55:24.219 --> 02:55:26.717
ALL: Vox Machina.

02:55:26.717 --> 02:55:29.872
ORION: (tearfully) You will be missed very much,
Pike.

02:55:29.872 --> 02:55:32.479
ASHLEY: I'm going to miss you guys very much.

02:55:32.479 --> 02:55:39.661
MATT: And on that note, we have to close because
people are in a rush. Yeah, Ashley will be leaving

02:55:39.661 --> 02:55:44.502
us for a time. She's going to New York for a few
months to shoot a web-- a television series.

02:55:44.502 --> 02:55:45.877
(laughter)

02:55:45.877 --> 02:55:47.439
SAM: A little web series.

02:55:47.502 --> 02:55:53.510
MATT: A wonderful television series she has
recurring. We're really happy and proud of her--

02:55:53.510 --> 02:55:56.186
we're just a jumble of emotions under the
circumstances.

02:55:56.186 --> 02:56:01.040
ASHLEY: You guys have been so amazing and have
made this experience even better for us, and thank

02:56:01.040 --> 02:56:07.543
you so much for going with us on our journey. It
will keep going, but I will be back when I can.

02:56:07.543 --> 02:56:08.510
ORION: You will be back.

02:56:08.510 --> 02:56:09.358
LAURA: You'll be back.

02:56:09.358 --> 02:56:10.286
TALIESIN: You'll be back.

02:56:10.286 --> 02:56:11.232
ORION: She will be back.

02:56:11.232 --> 02:56:12.344
ASHLEY: But it might be a long time.

02:56:12.344 --> 02:56:15.194
MATT: Yeah, she'll pop in and out if she can, and
there will eventually be a return of Pike, but for

02:56:15.194 --> 02:56:18.939
the time being she feels the calling to stay and
help rebuild this temple of Sarenrae.

02:56:18.939 --> 02:56:20.904
MARISHA: We're going to miss you, Pike.

02:56:20.904 --> 02:56:22.468
ASHLEY: I'm going to miss you guys.

02:56:22.468 --> 02:56:24.432
MARISHA: But we understand personal journeys.

02:56:24.432 --> 02:56:25.701
ASHLEY: Personal journey.

02:56:25.701 --> 02:56:28.231
TRAVIS: You have a good time.

02:56:28.231 --> 02:56:29.903
ASHLEY: I will.

02:56:29.903 --> 02:56:37.158
SAM: Pike, I, Scanlan, will not physically wait
for you, but emotionally--

02:56:37.158 --> 02:56:39.221
(laughter)

02:56:39.221 --> 02:56:47.015
SAM: Emotionally I will wait for you, and I will
not stray emotionally. I will always be there for

02:56:47.015 --> 02:56:48.463
you emotionally.

02:56:48.463 --> 02:56:49.466
ASHLEY: Okay, Scanlan.

02:56:49.466 --> 02:56:51.866
SAM: But physically, I mean, come on, it's going
to be months.

02:56:51.866 --> 02:56:57.468
MATT: Thank you so much, Ash. We're going to
miss you but we'll tabs and we'll have you back soon.

02:56:57.671 --> 02:56:58.513
ASHLEY: Okay.

02:56:58.513 --> 02:57:02.736
MATT: All right. Thank you all so much for
watching. Everyone give Ashley love on the

02:57:02.736 --> 02:57:04.071
Twitter, on the internet.

02:57:04.071 --> 02:57:05.208
TRAVIS: Good going, Ashley!

02:57:05.208 --> 02:57:11.253
MATT: And we'll see you guys at Comic-Con next
week. Those that'll be at Anime Expo, I'll be

02:57:11.253 --> 02:57:12.897
there tomorrow for a couple of panels.

02:57:12.897 --> 02:57:14.505
ZAC: Buy those shirts!

02:57:14.505 --> 02:57:15.677
SAM: Oh, yeah, buy the shirts.

02:57:15.677 --> 02:57:18.235
MATT: Six more days for the Critical Role shirts
before they go away.

02:57:18.281 --> 02:57:20.378
LAURA: Hey, it's still got Pike on it, you gotta
get it now.

02:57:20.378 --> 02:57:21.268
ALL: Yeah.

02:57:21.268 --> 02:57:22.382
SAM: Collector's edition.

02:57:22.382 --> 02:57:23.984
ASHLEY: Definitely limited edition.

02:57:23.984 --> 02:57:27.147
MATT: All right, guys, thank you and have a
wonderful evening, we've got to let these guys go.

02:57:27.147 --> 02:57:31.899
We'll see you-- me and Marisha will see you in
three weeks.

02:57:31.899 --> 02:57:34.103
ORION: See us at Comic-Con.

02:57:34.103 --> 02:57:36.181
MARISHA: We'll see you at Comic-Con.

02:57:36.181 --> 02:57:38.501
MATT: The others will see you in two. All right.
Have a wonderful night, guys.
