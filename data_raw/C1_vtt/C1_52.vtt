00:00:00.235 --> 00:00:03.896
MATT: Hello, and good evening everyone, to
tonight's episode of Critical Role, where a bunch

00:00:03.896 --> 00:00:11.158
of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play
Dungeons and Dragons. Tonight's going to be an

00:00:11.158 --> 00:00:15.609
interesting evening based on how we left off last
week, so we'll get to that here in a moment. First

00:00:15.609 --> 00:00:20.709
and foremost, let's get through our announcements.
At the top, we are excited. This episode and the

00:00:20.709 --> 00:00:24.652
episodes of this month are brought to you by our
new sponsor for this month, Loot Crate.

00:00:24.652 --> 00:00:27.375
(cheering)

00:00:27.375 --> 00:00:31.577
MATT: Me and Marisha have been Loot Crate--

00:00:31.577 --> 00:00:33.644
MARISHA: --purveyors for like three years.

00:00:33.644 --> 00:00:39.805
MATT: But they've been awesome enough and
interested in helping us sponsor this next month

00:00:39.805 --> 00:00:44.171
of content, so that being the case, if we want to
go ahead and open some of these boxes real fast,

00:00:44.171 --> 00:00:50.571
and see, so you're aware of the kind of stuff that
Loot Crate does. While they're opening this, Loot

00:00:50.571 --> 00:00:56.196
Crate is a monthly subscription box service that's
20 bucks a month and you get six to eight unique

00:00:56.196 --> 00:00:58.653
items that are based on a specific theme every
month.

00:00:58.653 --> 00:01:01.299
LAURA: Leeloo Dallas Multipass!

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:08.472
TALIESIN: This is the one that comes with the
Harry Potter socks.

00:01:08.472 --> 00:01:11.001
LAURA: Sorry, Matt, you were talking.

00:01:11.001 --> 00:01:13.466
MATT: That's okay. You guys show off what you
got.

00:01:13.466 --> 00:01:16.094
LIAM: I have a little cute facehugger for the
face.

00:01:16.094 --> 00:01:19.372
MARISHA: Yes, a drinking horn!

00:01:19.372 --> 00:01:31.241
SAM: I got a shofar! I'm still saying we should
rename the show Crate-ical Role for this month.

00:01:31.241 --> 00:01:32.511
I'm just saying.

00:01:32.511 --> 00:01:35.778
MATT: No, I'm good. I'm good on that, thank you.

00:01:35.778 --> 00:01:38.863
TALIESIN: This fabulous Labyrinth t-shirt, which
Travis is sporting.

00:01:38.863 --> 00:01:49.558
TRAVIS: I think if David Bowie can't keep you
alive, I don't know what can. Original War of the

00:01:49.558 --> 00:01:52.060
Worlds and The Day the Earth Stood Still prints?

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:59.199
MATT: So, the cool thing about this is, they send
you a new crate every month that has a certain

00:01:59.199 --> 00:02:02.776
theme and the content in that is based around that
theme. If you go to

00:02:02.776 --> 00:02:11.349
www.lootcrate.com/criticalrole, you can enter the
code 'criticalrole', one word, to save $3 on your

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:16.861
new subscription, so if you're thinking about it
and you want to try it out for a little while, go

00:02:16.861 --> 00:02:19.599
ahead and use our code and get yourself a nice
little discount, which is rad.

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:23.940
LIAM: The other neat thing about Loot Crate boxes
is you can turn them inside out and they become

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.016
something. This one's an arcade machine.

00:02:27.016 --> 00:02:28.956
MARISHA: This one's got a maze on the inside.

00:02:28.956 --> 00:02:31.022
TALIESIN: I keep all my stuff in these boxes.

00:02:31.022 --> 00:02:33.956
MARISHA: Yeah, they're good storage boxes. Or
regifting boxes.

00:02:33.956 --> 00:02:36.109
MATT: That the invasion box?

00:02:36.109 --> 00:02:40.797
TRAVIS: Yeah. There's an invasion box, a quest
box, and a power box, but we don't have that yet.

00:02:40.797 --> 00:02:42.665
MATT: Not yet, power box, I think, is this month.

00:02:42.665 --> 00:02:49.070
ASHLEY: There's so much X-Files stuff in here.
This is awesome.

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:51.259
MATT: (laughs) That was a good month.

00:02:51.259 --> 00:03:00.125
LAURA: I think May is World of Warcraft, DBZ. It's
got all these amazing things and I was like, I'm a

00:03:00.125 --> 00:03:02.420
part of all of these things and I want it!

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:10.517
MATT: I like how it's essentially a really tiny
pre-stream Critmas.

00:03:10.517 --> 00:03:20.820
SAM: Guys, you could watch us open stuff all
night.

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:23.709
MATT: I've already lost control of the episode.

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:28.452
TRAVIS: Go to Loot Crate, click the link. Show
some love.

00:03:28.452 --> 00:03:33.084
MATT: So, yeah, lootcrate.com/criticalrole. You
can put in 'criticalrole' as your code there and

00:03:33.084 --> 00:03:34.778
you'll get 3% off your subscription.

00:03:34.778 --> 00:03:36.063
MARISHA: $3 off.

00:03:36.063 --> 00:03:44.583
MATT: Or yeah, sorry, $3, not 3%. Much better than
3%. I'm so stupid. $3. It's awesome. Thank you,

00:03:44.583 --> 00:03:53.227
Loot Crate! Next announcement we have, for those
who missed it previously, it is now available: the

00:03:53.227 --> 00:04:02.862
latest issue of Rat Queens, in which Vox Machina
make a cameo appearance during a certain bar-crawl

00:04:02.862 --> 00:04:11.099
portion of the issue. And some wayward bard ends
up trying to buy a drink for one of the members.

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:13.619
TRAVIS: He's got glorious hair, though.

00:04:13.619 --> 00:04:15.965
MATT: He has glorious hair, which, mine is shorter
now, but it'll grow. Don't worry, those of you who

00:04:15.965 --> 00:04:21.814
freaked out. I've already gotten people who're
like, "You cut it!" and I'm like, "It's hair! I

00:04:21.814 --> 00:04:23.918
"live in the Valley where it's hot."

00:04:23.918 --> 00:04:26.101
LAURA: Well, it's not really hot right now.

00:04:26.101 --> 00:04:33.761
MATT: Yeah, not today. Today, the weather's been
nice. So, yeah, next up on the list, Taliesin.

00:04:33.761 --> 00:04:39.250
Supposedly, for those who haven't seen it, the
next run on Signal Boost, the show that Marisha

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:44.255
writes and produces for, has a new person hosting
the next series of episodes.

00:04:44.255 --> 00:04:49.871
TALIESIN: Who's hosting the new series-- Oh, fuck.
I'd better start working on that right now. Oh.

00:04:49.871 --> 00:04:56.932
It's going to be great. No, I'm having a lot of
fun. We're putting it together, and--

00:04:56.932 --> 00:05:02.034
MARISHA: It's going to be weird. We're going even
weirder. So for everyone who already hates how

00:05:02.034 --> 00:05:03.452
weird it is, buckle up.

00:05:03.452 --> 00:05:17.007
MATT: All right, so, look for that. All right.
Also, there is a new series of Geek and Sundry

00:05:17.007 --> 00:05:24.036
website content coming up called Ask Vox Machina,
in which Vox Machina members have been written to

00:05:24.036 --> 00:05:29.854
by various people living in the world of
Tal'Dorei, asking how to solve their problems. Our

00:05:29.854 --> 00:05:33.348
wondrous players here are answering them in
character. I believe the first one is going to be

00:05:33.348 --> 00:05:34.625
Sam, right?

00:05:34.625 --> 00:05:41.768
SAM: Yeah, Scanlan got some great letters from the
fans, and he replied with some award-winning

00:05:41.768 --> 00:05:45.920
advice. So, check that out tomorrow on
geekandsundry.com.

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:48.373
TALIESIN: Participation awards all around.

00:05:48.373 --> 00:05:50.712
MATT: (laughs) Did you say anticipation awards?

00:05:50.712 --> 00:05:51.719
TALIESIN: Participation.

00:05:51.719 --> 00:05:58.843
MATT: Oh, I like anticipation awards, too. There's
a video game that some people may have heard of

00:05:58.843 --> 00:06:04.692
called Uncharted 4 that's coming out. Reviews have
been coming out and everyone's giving it the best

00:06:04.692 --> 00:06:06.086
game of forever.

00:06:06.086 --> 00:06:07.365
LAURA: It's amazing!

00:06:07.365 --> 00:06:12.674
MATT: So, and I believe one of our own Vox Machina
plays a rather awesome role in that, Laura?

00:06:12.674 --> 00:06:14.889
(cheering)

00:06:14.889 --> 00:06:18.208
MATT: Nadine Ross in the story.

00:06:18.208 --> 00:06:21.866
LAURA: Yeah, she's a villain, so you get to face
off with her. It's really fun.

00:06:21.866 --> 00:06:23.092
MATT: That is exciting.

00:06:23.092 --> 00:06:24.454
LIAM: You are a good actor.

00:06:24.454 --> 00:06:29.669
MATT: And in the multiplayer you might hear me try
and kill you a couple times.

00:06:29.669 --> 00:06:32.559
LIAM: Yeah, kill him a lot for what he's about to
do!

00:06:32.559 --> 00:06:36.449
SAM: You also might hear me try to heal you a
couple times.

00:06:36.449 --> 00:06:38.899
MATT: Okay, so between us, we got you.

00:06:38.899 --> 00:06:41.968
LAURA: That's right, I remember when we were going
in for multiplayer, it was like, we've got several

00:06:41.968 --> 00:06:45.848
members of Vox Machina as the multiplayer
characters, which is pretty ridiculous.

00:06:45.848 --> 00:06:55.915
MATT: Should be fun. All right. Also, we put the
new full title intro on Facebook yesterday, so you

00:06:55.915 --> 00:07:02.221
guys can get it in hi-def glory at your request.
And we've already hit a million views on it in a day.

00:07:02.221 --> 00:07:04.034
TRAVIS: (laughs) Which is weird.

00:07:04.034 --> 00:07:05.912
LIAM: Dungeons and Dragons!

00:07:05.912 --> 00:07:14.921
MATT: It's a good time when you can dress up as
your D&amp;amp;D characters for a weekend and people on

00:07:14.921 --> 00:07:17.763
Facebook are like, cool. Like, that's the weirdest
thing ever.

00:07:17.763 --> 00:07:19.781
TALIESIN: A million people go, huh.

00:07:19.781 --> 00:07:22.355
MATT: Huh. That's a thing. (laughs)

00:07:22.355 --> 00:07:24.684
LAURA: Although I did get made fun of already.

00:07:24.684 --> 00:07:25.747
MATT: Did you?

00:07:25.747 --> 00:07:28.672
LAURA: Some fan pointed out that I looked stupid.

00:07:28.672 --> 00:07:30.291
MATT: Did they really?

00:07:30.291 --> 00:07:33.603
SAM: I wouldn't call that person a fan,
necessarily.

00:07:33.603 --> 00:07:38.515
MATT: They say that (funny voice) I love the intro
but Laura Bailey looks stupid.

00:07:38.515 --> 00:07:40.984
LAURA: (fake cries)

00:07:40.984 --> 00:07:42.551
SAM: I'm sorry I wrote that.

00:07:42.551 --> 00:07:44.677
LAURA: It was Sam.

00:07:44.677 --> 00:07:53.087
MATT: All right, last couple things here. The
title song actually for that intro, written by our

00:07:53.087 --> 00:07:58.144
wondrous friend of the show, Jason Charles Miller,
who you saw play as Garthok, the half-orc rogue a

00:07:58.144 --> 00:08:02.399
number of episodes back, who wrote our original
theme and the new one, has it up on iTunes. So if

00:08:02.399 --> 00:08:08.424
you want to have the most badass, nerdy ringtone
and/or music to play on repeat until you start

00:08:08.424 --> 00:08:12.597
bleeding out of your nose, that is now available
on iTunes, so you can search for the Critical Role

00:08:12.597 --> 00:08:17.969
intro music. It's awesome. All right, Liam, you
want to take it away?

00:08:17.969 --> 00:08:25.025
LIAM: We've come a long way to get here tonight.
It's true we may die, and when our bones are

00:08:25.025 --> 00:08:32.697
turned to dust, carry them away in Wyrmwood gaming
boxes, the finest wooden boxes for carrying the

00:08:32.697 --> 00:08:37.343
remains of the dead ever. They're great! Oh and
you can put dice in 'em too, which is probably

00:08:37.343 --> 00:08:41.839
their intended purpose. And if you like them, they
have many different kinds of woods, you go to

00:08:41.839 --> 00:08:47.101
wyrmwoodgaming.com. And if you want to pay for
shipping, you can, but if you don't want to pay

00:08:47.101 --> 00:08:49.135
for shipping, use the code 'critrole'.

00:08:49.135 --> 00:08:51.104
ALL: Critrole!

00:08:51.104 --> 00:08:55.983
LIAM: Feels so good. And you'll get free shipping.
And then also, lastly, this is the last couple of

00:08:55.983 --> 00:09:02.501
hours for their kickstarter for the sentinel box.
You can get our logo onto any box, like this, or

00:09:02.501 --> 00:09:10.293
you can get the real swag and get the master box.
It looks like this on any wood. And you put your

00:09:10.293 --> 00:09:12.054
dice in it, cards in it.

00:09:12.054 --> 00:09:19.424
ASHLEY: My favorite part of Wyrmwood Gaming is the
magnets. Magnets, bitch!

00:09:19.424 --> 00:09:20.990
(laughter)

00:09:20.990 --> 00:09:22.529
MATT: It's so satisfying.

00:09:22.529 --> 00:09:30.704
LIAM: So, that kickstarter, a couple more hours,
then finito if you want to get in on that. Okay.

00:09:30.704 --> 00:09:34.490
MATT: Cool. And last but not least on my list, it
says 'death to all puppies'. I don't know who

00:09:34.490 --> 00:09:35.530
wrote that.

00:09:35.530 --> 00:09:37.099
TRAVIS: Who would write that?

00:09:37.099 --> 00:09:38.828
LAURA: It was you, Matt. It was you!

00:09:38.828 --> 00:09:48.836
MATT: I'm going to assume it's Sam. It's usually
Sam. All right. Well, then, let's go ahead and

00:09:48.836 --> 00:09:58.252
bring this down now to get in the mood for
tonight's episode of Critical Role.

00:09:58.252 --> 00:11:30.298
[dramatic music]

00:11:30.298 --> 00:11:38.267
MATT: Welcome back. So! Leaving off from last
week's episode, the party of intrepid adventurers,

00:11:38.267 --> 00:11:43.521
Vox Machina, trying to save the whole of Tal'Dorei
from the Chroma Conclave, a collection of

00:11:43.521 --> 00:11:47.961
chromatic dragons that have destroyed many of the
main cities here, have gone about searching for

00:11:47.961 --> 00:11:51.977
items called the Vestiges of Divergence, magical
artifacts from a war of ancient times that

00:11:51.977 --> 00:11:57.290
apparently hold some great power that could aid in
defeating these dragons. One of which, apparently,

00:11:57.290 --> 00:12:06.034
is being held by Kevdak, the leader of the herd of
roaming tribal barbaric individuals that Grog once

00:12:06.034 --> 00:12:13.065
belonged to, and had beaten the crap out of and
left Grog for dead long ago. While the dragons had

00:12:13.065 --> 00:12:17.816
destroyed part of Westruun and left it behind,
this tribe utilized that time to take over the

00:12:17.816 --> 00:12:23.207
town, enslaving or keeping most of the people
under their thumb, and making an accord with the

00:12:23.207 --> 00:12:28.964
one black dragon, Umbrasyl, that is currently in a
tenuous relationship right now with these herd

00:12:28.964 --> 00:12:38.248
members, Herd of the Storm, as they're known. You,
having sent a few of them to their death via a

00:12:38.248 --> 00:12:43.822
trap on the outside, found your way into the city,
saved some of the individuals that lived there, as

00:12:43.822 --> 00:12:51.608
well as Kaylie and Dr. Dranzel, and Grog went
ahead and issued a challenge to the Herd to meet

00:12:51.608 --> 00:12:58.663
with Kevdak himself. After some fairly decent
intimidation checks, it was agreed, and while most

00:12:58.663 --> 00:13:02.953
of the party stealthed behind, you made your way
to the very center of the town square, where

00:13:02.953 --> 00:13:11.048
Kevdak leapt off the top of the ex-Margrave's
homestead and the two of you began to do battle in

00:13:11.048 --> 00:13:15.489
a pit of spikes that was gathered in the center of
the town square, surrounded by a number of the

00:13:15.489 --> 00:13:23.564
clan watching on. During this fight, it went back
and forth a bit before Grog felt that this was a

00:13:23.564 --> 00:13:29.109
losing battle should it continue in this way and
decided to, at least it seemed to me, call out to

00:13:29.109 --> 00:13:37.862
his friends for aid with the classic Shakespearean
battle cry of, "Vox Machina, fuck shit up!"

00:13:37.862 --> 00:13:39.475
LIAM: That's from Coriolanus.

00:13:39.475 --> 00:13:44.305
MATT: Oh, sorry, Coriolanus, thank you. And that
is where we're picking up. So--

00:13:44.305 --> 00:13:51.311
SAM: Before we go, I have to inspire everyone with
this.

00:13:51.311 --> 00:13:55.297
(laughter)

00:13:55.297 --> 00:13:57.756
MATT: Holy shit. What the-- what?

00:13:57.756 --> 00:14:02.653
TALIESIN: What are you? What the fuck are you? Oh
my God!

00:14:02.653 --> 00:14:05.341
LIAM: I want a d10!

00:14:05.341 --> 00:14:12.351
SAM: And look, Ashley's, like, somewhere, I can't
even see.

00:14:12.351 --> 00:14:18.271
MATT: Please tell me that was a gift from
somebody.

00:14:18.271 --> 00:14:25.669
SAM: No, I made this myself, because I wanted you
all to know how passionate I was about tonight.

00:14:25.669 --> 00:14:29.508
LIAM: Sam? Could you kiss your right gun?

00:14:29.508 --> 00:14:33.796
ASHLEY: Kiss it! Kiss it!

00:14:33.796 --> 00:14:43.864
SAM: Mm. Tastes like strawberries. And sweat.

00:14:43.864 --> 00:14:48.952
MATT: Inspiration granted and immediately taken
away.

00:14:48.952 --> 00:14:52.067
TRAVIS: Do your pants also have photoshopped
lightning coming out of the crotch?

00:14:52.067 --> 00:14:53.687
SAM: No, my pants are just jeans.

00:14:53.687 --> 00:14:56.125
ASHLEY: Wait, how far down does it go?

00:14:56.125 --> 00:14:57.974
SAM: All the way, baby.

00:14:57.974 --> 00:15:02.867
MATT: That's the first step of the process. The
pants come soon.

00:15:02.867 --> 00:15:04.783
LAURA: Did you just do that at home with a--?

00:15:04.783 --> 00:15:06.576
SAM: Yeah, I just penciled it in.

00:15:06.576 --> 00:15:18.728
MATT: I can't even. That's a thing. All righty,
so, with that, we are going into the realm of

00:15:18.728 --> 00:15:27.240
battle. Let's go ahead and kick on the proper
music for this. So, with Vox Machina currently on

00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:33.099
the rooftops here and hiding within the bottom of
this building, we have the four archers that have

00:15:33.099 --> 00:15:37.575
appeared on the rooftop of the Margrave's house.
We have most of the individuals that are

00:15:37.575 --> 00:15:43.032
surrounding this, along with the few innocents,
which just for the sake of appearance, here, I

00:15:43.032 --> 00:15:46.168
will go ahead and attempt to mark with a few
markers so you know who you're looking for,

00:15:46.168 --> 00:15:47.956
innocents-wise.

00:15:47.956 --> 00:15:50.475
LIAM: We're the innocents, Matt. We're the
innocents.

00:15:50.475 --> 00:16:02.101
MATT: No, you're not. Not anymore. All right, so,
the red markers are going to act as markers for

00:16:02.101 --> 00:16:07.129
the innocent, just so you're aware.

00:16:07.129 --> 00:16:20.096
TRAVIS: Percy. Percy! Taliesin! You're on that
roof, right?

00:16:20.096 --> 00:16:32.162
MATT: Percy's over there. All righty, so, that all
being the case, guys, as Grog shouted, at this

00:16:32.162 --> 00:16:39.597
moment the individuals in the center of the square
start looking around, confused, not knowing where

00:16:39.597 --> 00:16:46.256
to come from. At this moment, a few of them manage
to catch up a glance at the individuals that are

00:16:46.256 --> 00:16:50.048
on the rooftops. I need everyone to roll
initiative, along with you, Grog, because combat

00:16:50.048 --> 00:16:52.400
has begun again at this point at the top.

00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:54.681
MARISHA: Wait, all of us?

00:16:54.681 --> 00:16:57.275
MATT: All of you guys. This has started.

00:16:57.275 --> 00:17:12.134
TALIESIN: I mean, that's not amazing. That's
better. 14.

00:17:12.134 --> 00:17:24.221
MARISHA: You're still ahead of me. You rolled a
nat 20?

00:17:24.221 --> 00:17:30.051
ASHLEY: Why's he laughing?

00:17:30.051 --> 00:17:31.715
TRAVIS: Because he's fucking evil.

00:17:31.715 --> 00:17:35.516
MATT: 'Because he's fucking evil'? Is that what
you said?

00:17:35.516 --> 00:17:38.304
TRAVIS: Who said that? I will beat him with my
fists.

00:17:38.304 --> 00:17:45.825
MATT: All right, so, for the sake of this one, we
have 25 to 20.

00:17:45.825 --> 00:17:47.727
LAURA: 27.

00:17:47.727 --> 00:17:51.306
LIAM: 24.

00:17:51.306 --> 00:17:54.284
SAM: 21.

00:17:54.284 --> 00:17:57.505
MATT: 21, okay, so we have-- let's see.

00:17:57.505 --> 00:18:03.728
LIAM: All the people who wanted to go first are
going first.

00:18:03.728 --> 00:18:06.884
MATT: All right, 20 to 15?

00:18:06.884 --> 00:18:09.941
TRAVIS: 18.

00:18:09.941 --> 00:18:22.923
MATT: All righty. 15 to ten.

00:18:22.923 --> 00:18:24.713
TALIESIN: 14.

00:18:24.713 --> 00:18:26.130
MARISHA: 13.

00:18:26.130 --> 00:18:27.781
ASHLEY: 12.

00:18:27.781 --> 00:18:30.790
MATT: Pike, getting into the double-digits!

00:18:30.790 --> 00:18:33.855
ASHLEY: Oh, you know. Moving on up.

00:18:33.855 --> 00:18:38.935
TALIESIN: I'd rather have my low roll here than
for anything else.

00:18:38.935 --> 00:18:41.477
LAURA: Oh god, oh god, oh god, oh god.

00:18:41.477 --> 00:18:47.890
TRAVIS: It's like a roller coaster. We're just
going tick-tick-tick-tick-shooom.

00:18:47.890 --> 00:19:07.197
MATT: A lot here I'm keeping track of, guys. All
right, so, the surprise round affects all the

00:19:07.197 --> 00:19:15.235
archers. It affects everyone except for these four
individuals, or these two individuals with the

00:19:15.235 --> 00:19:28.034
clubs, and these two women here with big swords,
and Kevdak. So, top of the round, Vex.

00:19:28.034 --> 00:19:33.514
LAURA: Does the second story of the house that I'm
in have windows? Can I see?

00:19:33.514 --> 00:19:35.715
MATT: The second story does.

00:19:35.715 --> 00:19:41.752
LAURA: Can I run up the stairs, then, so I can get
a better look at the playing field?

00:19:41.752 --> 00:19:47.376
MATT: Actually, this one was supposed to go this
way for the entrance point there. All right. So

00:19:47.376 --> 00:19:50.631
you are currently now looking out the side of the
window.

00:19:50.631 --> 00:19:59.180
LAURA: Okay. I'm going to-- I'm already hiding,
right?

00:19:59.180 --> 00:20:00.671
MATT: Right, no one's seen you at this point.

00:20:00.671 --> 00:20:07.582
LAURA: Okay, then I'm going to Hunter's Mark
Kevdak. And I'm going to hold my turn--

00:20:07.582 --> 00:20:11.043
MATT: Putting a green on him for the Hunter's
Mark.

00:20:11.043 --> 00:20:18.347
LAURA: I'm going to hold my turn until it seems
like he's better incapacitated or until something

00:20:18.347 --> 00:20:20.467
happens. I'm going to hold my turn.

00:20:20.467 --> 00:20:21.952
MATT: Hold your action until--?

00:20:21.952 --> 00:20:26.750
LAURA: I think until Scanlan goes.

00:20:26.750 --> 00:20:33.548
MATT: Okay, so that finishes your turn. Vax,
you're up.

00:20:33.548 --> 00:20:36.266
LIAM: Am I at a window as well, downstairs?

00:20:36.266 --> 00:20:37.939
MATT: You are by a door.

00:20:37.939 --> 00:20:41.378
LIAM: Am I half on a street? In a door?

00:20:41.378 --> 00:20:45.488
MATT: You're inside the house right now. The door
is technically partially ajar because you guys did slip in.

00:20:45.488 --> 00:20:52.266
LIAM: All right, I'm going to click my boots,
crack the door a few inches, and I'm going to hold

00:20:52.266 --> 00:21:00.737
my turn until one of our magic-users pulls a trick
or Kevdak takes a swing at Grog.

00:21:00.737 --> 00:21:09.039
MATT: Okay. That'll end your current actions.
The archers are surprised. They do not go. It is

00:21:09.039 --> 00:21:17.442
Kevdak's turn. Kevdak sees you shouting out. He
rolled a natural 20 on his initiative.

00:21:17.442 --> 00:21:19.791
LAURA: No, he didn't! That's why you shook your
fucking head.

00:21:19.791 --> 00:21:22.837
MATT: Yeah. I was like, man, all right. Let's
start this right.

00:21:22.837 --> 00:21:25.234
MARISHA: Fucking Wheaton!

00:21:25.234 --> 00:21:32.395
MATT: They had Wheaton come in and touch all my
stuff. All right, so he's going to go ahead and,

00:21:32.395 --> 00:21:41.207
seeing you shout like this, he looks about for a
second. He's going to continue his rage. He

00:21:41.207 --> 00:21:52.538
glances about, looks over and he sees nothing
immediately on the rooftops, but looks down at

00:21:52.538 --> 00:21:58.109
this individual now shouting out for help before
him, prostrate, and he gives you a glance and

00:21:58.109 --> 00:22:06.409
says, "Well this seems real familiar, doesn't it,
Strongjaw?" At which point he's going to go ahead

00:22:06.409 --> 00:22:24.855
and take two of his reckless attacks against you.
That's going to be a 28 to hit.

00:22:24.855 --> 00:22:27.395
TRAVIS: I'll have to look, but I think it hits.

00:22:27.395 --> 00:22:31.900
MATT: Yeah. Second attack is a 30 to hit.

00:22:31.900 --> 00:22:33.637
TRAVIS: These aren't Great Weapon Master, right?

00:22:33.637 --> 00:22:35.451
MATT: No, these are not Great Weapon Master.

00:22:35.451 --> 00:22:41.681
LAURA: What is his attack fucking bonus?

00:22:41.681 --> 00:22:45.668
TALIESIN: At least ten.

00:22:45.668 --> 00:23:06.622
MATT: You take 30 points of slashing damage,
reduced to 15. And two points of necrotic damage,

00:23:06.622 --> 00:23:15.779
because it's not reduced. And second one's going
to be 22 points of slashing damage, reduced to 11,

00:23:15.779 --> 00:23:17.736
and then five points of necrotic on top of that.

00:23:17.736 --> 00:23:25.648
SAM: However, for the second slash, I'm going to
use Cutting Words to reduce the damage.

00:23:25.648 --> 00:23:31.199
TRAVIS: Before he does that, you said 17 on the
first one, 11 on the second attack, and how much

00:23:31.199 --> 00:23:32.645
necrotic on the second one?

00:23:32.645 --> 00:23:37.725
LAURA: Seven overall. Plus two necrotic on the
first hit. Five necrotic on the second.

00:23:37.725 --> 00:23:46.173
MATT: You might have to get a little bit closer to
make sure that he can hear you.

00:23:46.173 --> 00:23:49.428
LAURA: Plus that would be giving away your
hiding.

00:23:49.428 --> 00:23:52.846
MATT: What're you going to do, Sam?

00:23:52.846 --> 00:23:58.152
SAM: I step forward closer to him and I use
Cutting Words.

00:23:58.152 --> 00:24:03.393
MATT: Okay, you step to the very edge of the
rooftop here.

00:24:03.393 --> 00:24:04.894
LAURA: Oh god.

00:24:04.894 --> 00:24:07.038
MATT: We'll say for the sake of this, right
there.

00:24:07.038 --> 00:24:15.033
SAM: And I shout, oi, Kevdak! I have a message
from the people of Westruun! And I moon him.

00:24:15.033 --> 00:24:17.839
(laughter)

00:24:17.839 --> 00:24:20.991
SAM: And I say, kiss our metaphorical hairy
arses!

00:24:20.991 --> 00:24:29.538
MATT: Just like that on your shirt. As he brings
around his axe for a second swing, he hears that

00:24:29.538 --> 00:24:35.302
and glances over his shoulder and sees this shiny
gnome butt up on the top. Continuing the swing,

00:24:35.302 --> 00:24:38.748
though, to attack. Go ahead and reduce the damage
using your Cutting Words.

00:24:38.748 --> 00:24:40.295
SAM: Ten, right?

00:24:40.295 --> 00:24:41.442
MATT: Uh-huh.

00:24:41.442 --> 00:24:43.785
SAM: Pff. One.

00:24:43.785 --> 00:24:55.186
MATT: So you take ten points of slashing damage
from that strike. Oh, you're wielding Mythcarver,

00:24:55.186 --> 00:24:58.225
so his next saving throw is at disadvantage,
right?

00:24:58.225 --> 00:24:59.376
SAM: Yes, it is.

00:24:59.376 --> 00:25:07.326
MATT: Because you're not currently wielding your
weapon, Kevdak's going to go ahead and take a step

00:25:07.326 --> 00:25:16.423
back and glance over at you, as he's going to move
his fingers up and point towards the roof. And you

00:25:16.423 --> 00:25:20.937
see a bunch of the other entities and archers,
whoosh, shift their attention over in your

00:25:20.937 --> 00:25:29.529
direction, Sam. All right, that finishes Kevdak's
turn. Scanlan, you're up next. Actually, you do

00:25:29.529 --> 00:25:34.628
get an attack of opportunity on him with your
fist. Because you're not holding your warhammer

00:25:34.628 --> 00:25:36.022
right now.

00:25:36.022 --> 00:25:40.242
TRAVIS: I rolled a five, plus what? My strength?

00:25:40.242 --> 00:25:43.738
MATT: I mean, it's your strength modifier plus
your proficiency modifier.

00:25:43.738 --> 00:25:46.987
TRAVIS: 13?

00:25:46.987 --> 00:25:55.980
MATT: 13, no. You punch his back and it just hits
off his muscle. All right. Sam, you're up.

00:25:55.980 --> 00:26:02.960
SAM: Okay. From my crouched, butt-out position,
whilst holding my Hand Cone of Clarity.

00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:04.724
MATT: Where are you holding it?

00:26:04.724 --> 00:26:06.969
SAM: It's shoved up there.

00:26:06.969 --> 00:26:08.359
LIAM: Between the legs, upside-down.

00:26:08.359 --> 00:26:22.076
SAM: Before I make this attack, when I scanned
around, did I see any of his allies without any

00:26:22.076 --> 00:26:25.483
weapons or carrying a staff or something like
that?

00:26:25.483 --> 00:26:35.559
MATT: No, they're all the type of people that
would be at all times wielding something at their

00:26:35.559 --> 00:26:41.180
side. There are two individuals that you do
notice, there is this one here, and there is

00:26:41.180 --> 00:26:48.152
Greenbeard right there, and they both appear to
have some sort of a quarterstaff-type implement,

00:26:48.152 --> 00:26:52.114
but everything else is either bladed or giant
clubs or some sort of big melee weapon.

00:26:52.114 --> 00:26:53.665
SAM: But they're surprised anyway.

00:26:53.665 --> 00:26:54.651
MATT: They are, yes.

00:26:54.651 --> 00:27:01.449
SAM: Okay. Okay. Well, then, I will cast Hold
Person at level three on Kevdak.

00:27:01.449 --> 00:27:02.598
MATT: On Kevdak.

00:27:02.598 --> 00:27:03.661
SAM: Yes.

00:27:03.661 --> 00:27:05.885
MATT: Oh boy.

00:27:05.885 --> 00:27:08.972
SAM: At level three, so I get to target one other
individual.

00:27:08.972 --> 00:27:10.868
MATT: You would, yeah.

00:27:10.868 --> 00:27:15.540
SAM: And I would target the beardy guy with the
staff.

00:27:15.540 --> 00:27:24.680
MATT: All right, Hold Person. For a minute, wisdom
saving throw, for the duration. Okay.

00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:27.255
SAM: Wisdom saving throw with disadvantage.

00:27:27.255 --> 00:27:30.730
MATT: With disadvantage, yes, that is true.
Kevdak. All right.

00:27:30.730 --> 00:27:32.273
SAM: Because of Cutting Words.

00:27:32.273 --> 00:27:42.395
MATT: He rolled a 19 and an eight. Taking the
eight, that brings it to a ten, so that's a

00:27:42.395 --> 00:27:43.783
failure on him.

00:27:43.783 --> 00:27:45.418
(cheering)

00:27:45.418 --> 00:27:53.627
LAURA: For Hold Person, does it un-paralyze him if
we hit him?

00:27:53.627 --> 00:28:01.881
SAM: No. He's just paralyzed. You can have at him.
And can I still move and do other things?

00:28:01.881 --> 00:28:06.525
MATT: You can in a moment. We have to figure out
if the other guy makes his save. He rolls a

00:28:06.525 --> 00:28:07.752
natural one.

00:28:07.752 --> 00:28:09.324
LAURA: Yay!

00:28:09.324 --> 00:28:12.328
MATT: Aw, man, the rest of these people are going
to be real pissed.

00:28:12.328 --> 00:28:14.872
LIAM: This is where my held turn comes in.

00:28:14.872 --> 00:28:16.422
LAURA: Me too, but I was in front of you.

00:28:16.422 --> 00:28:18.044
LIAM: Yeah, go for it.

00:28:18.044 --> 00:28:20.351
TRAVIS: If you hit him, does he become not
paralyzed?

00:28:20.351 --> 00:28:21.698
LIAM: No, he's stuck.

00:28:21.698 --> 00:28:27.109
MATT: Yes. At the end of each of his turns, the
target can make another wisdom saving throw. And

00:28:27.109 --> 00:28:32.566
paralyzed, for those who are aware what
paralyzation does, a paralyzed creature is

00:28:32.566 --> 00:28:36.320
incapacitated and cannot speak, automatically
fails strength and dexterity saving throws,

00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:40.674
attacks rolls have advantage, and any attack that
hits the target is a critical hit if it's within

00:28:40.674 --> 00:28:42.038
five feet of the creature.

00:28:42.038 --> 00:28:45.617
LAURA: Oh, five feet. Damn it. Oh, but that's good
for Grog. Okay.

00:28:45.617 --> 00:28:47.505
SAM: Okay, wait. I still get my move, right?

00:28:47.505 --> 00:28:48.467
MATT: You do.

00:28:48.467 --> 00:28:52.493
SAM: Okay. Is there any cover? Are there chimneys?
Is there anything I can duck behind?

00:28:52.493 --> 00:28:54.703
MATT: You can duck behind the other side of this
roof if you'd like.

00:28:54.703 --> 00:28:58.161
SAM: And still maintain sight? Oh, wait, no, I'd
be more than 60 feet away.

00:28:58.161 --> 00:29:04.284
MATT: I mean, it's more the casting time. You can
still move away once you've cast the spell and

00:29:04.284 --> 00:29:05.459
hold it there.

00:29:05.459 --> 00:29:11.013
SAM: Okay. Then I'll duck back behind some cover.
And as my bonus, I still get a bonus, I will

00:29:11.013 --> 00:29:17.630
inspire Grog and I'll say, Grog! Now it's your
turn to fuck shit up.

00:29:17.630 --> 00:29:19.560
(laughter)

00:29:19.560 --> 00:29:20.962
SAM: All right.

00:29:20.962 --> 00:29:23.338
MATT: And that finishes your turn, Scanlan?

00:29:23.338 --> 00:29:24.320
SAM: Yeah, that's it.

00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:25.488
MATT: Grog, you're up.

00:29:25.488 --> 00:29:26.821
TRAVIS: He's paralyzed.

00:29:26.821 --> 00:29:33.773
MATT: You watch as he steps away from you, points
up, and all the archers turn towards that,

00:29:33.773 --> 00:29:40.122
everyone else looks over at the rooftop and you
hear a cacophony of voices around growling, before

00:29:40.122 --> 00:29:46.075
Kevdak takes another step and (grunts). And you
see the gleaming ass of Scanlan in the distance,

00:29:46.075 --> 00:29:55.016
the high noonday sun bouncing off of his pale,
sun-dappled, gnomish skin. These two round globes

00:29:55.016 --> 00:29:57.796
of victory staring down from the rooftop.

00:29:57.796 --> 00:30:00.383
SAM: Round globes of victory! I love it.

00:30:00.383 --> 00:30:03.779
TRAVIS: Can I walk around to the front of Kevdak?

00:30:03.779 --> 00:30:05.791
MATT: Do you want to pick up your weapon first,
or?

00:30:05.791 --> 00:30:06.977
TRAVIS: No.

00:30:06.977 --> 00:30:08.796
MATT: Nope? Okay.

00:30:08.796 --> 00:30:10.599
LIAM: Do the twins go first or does Grog go
first?

00:30:10.599 --> 00:30:13.963
MATT: Oh right, because you held your actions, so,
up to you.

00:30:13.963 --> 00:30:16.770
SAM: Okay, do your thing, do your thing.

00:30:16.770 --> 00:30:18.090
LIAM: I'm going to go.

00:30:18.090 --> 00:30:19.308
LAURA: I'm going to go.

00:30:19.308 --> 00:30:23.517
MATT: Yep. All right. So. We have now Vex, taking
your shots.

00:30:23.517 --> 00:30:27.067
LAURA: Yes. Yes. I'm going to shoot from my
Longbow of the Sky Sentinel. So that's three

00:30:27.067 --> 00:30:28.557
attacks on the first attack.

00:30:28.557 --> 00:30:32.441
MATT: Yes, and they all have advantage because
he's paralyzed. This is bad for Kevdak, but we'll

00:30:32.441 --> 00:30:33.802
see how it works.

00:30:33.802 --> 00:30:35.151
LAURA: Okay, so.

00:30:35.151 --> 00:30:37.320
MATT: Still raging, so everything's half-damage.

00:30:37.320 --> 00:30:39.733
LAURA: So 19 plus 12 probably hits on the first
attack.

00:30:39.733 --> 00:30:41.099
MATT: Yeah, that does.

00:30:41.099 --> 00:30:46.512
LAURA: Okay. 19 plus 12 hits on the second.

00:30:46.512 --> 00:30:47.833
MATT: Yep.

00:30:47.833 --> 00:30:50.405
LAURA: And 17 plus 12 hits on the third?

00:30:50.405 --> 00:30:51.537
MATT: Yeah, they all hit.

00:30:51.537 --> 00:31:06.860
LAURA: Okay. I'm adjusting my glasses, I'm so
nervous. Okay. 28 on the first hit.

00:31:06.860 --> 00:31:08.924
MATT: 28, reduced to 14, okay.

00:31:08.924 --> 00:31:17.739
LAURA: 21 on the second hit.

00:31:17.739 --> 00:31:21.483
ASHLEY: Get him, baby.

00:31:21.483 --> 00:31:27.041
LAURA: 16 on the third hit.

00:31:27.041 --> 00:31:31.384
MATT: Okay, that reduces to eight. All the arrows
strike true, thump-thump-thump, but still each one

00:31:31.384 --> 00:31:38.184
is only piercing the flesh so far, he's generally
so dense in his musculature, each impact is not

00:31:38.184 --> 00:31:45.318
having the same satisfying (impact) sound you're
used to. But that ends your held action and it is

00:31:45.318 --> 00:31:46.641
now your turn.

00:31:46.641 --> 00:31:48.164
LAURA: Oh, but I get another attack, because
that's just one attack.

00:31:48.164 --> 00:31:50.549
MATT: Oh right, that was the sky sentinel, go for
it. Take a second attack.

00:31:50.549 --> 00:31:56.210
LAURA: My second attack, I'm going to take at
Greenbeard, and I'm going to shoot through the

00:31:56.210 --> 00:31:58.193
flaming bowstring.

00:31:58.193 --> 00:31:59.657
MATT: Okay.

00:31:59.657 --> 00:32:07.099
LAURA: 17 plus 12 probably hits? 17 plus 12?

00:32:07.099 --> 00:32:08.416
MATT: Yeah, that's going to hit.

00:32:08.416 --> 00:32:19.760
LAURA: Okay. Gah! 14 on that one.

00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:24.973
MATT: 14, okay. 14 damage to him. Greenbeard is
currently stuck there in place, the arrow sinks

00:32:24.973 --> 00:32:30.573
into his robe and you don't even see the impact,
it absorbs into the cloth and he goes, ah, and you

00:32:30.573 --> 00:32:33.623
hear the escaping air from the impact but he can't
actually move.

00:32:33.623 --> 00:32:35.364
TALIESIN: Hunter's Mark.

00:32:35.364 --> 00:32:37.806
LAURA: I hunter's marked, he's hunter's marked
already.

00:32:37.806 --> 00:32:39.107
TALIESIN: Okay.

00:32:39.107 --> 00:32:41.344
MATT: At this point, you'd better.

00:32:41.344 --> 00:32:42.700
TALIESIN: We're not panicking, no, not at all.

00:32:42.700 --> 00:32:44.796
LAURA: Not at all. Hunter's Mark! I did it, I
swear!

00:32:44.796 --> 00:32:46.070
MATT: All right. You're up.

00:32:46.070 --> 00:32:52.141
LIAM: Just to verify, because Kevdak is still
raging, am I denied the surprise attack from

00:32:52.141 --> 00:32:53.408
inside here?

00:32:53.408 --> 00:32:54.527
MATT: Correct.

00:32:54.527 --> 00:33:02.518
LIAM: Okay. So I'm going to use sharpshooter and
drop five to hit harder, I'm going to throw a

00:33:02.518 --> 00:33:05.778
dagger at advantage, yeah?

00:33:05.778 --> 00:33:07.334
MATT: So you're moving up into the doorway.

00:33:07.334 --> 00:33:08.988
LIAM: Yeah, to the doorway, right, so the first--

00:33:08.988 --> 00:33:10.266
MATT: Who are you attacking?

00:33:10.266 --> 00:33:11.676
LIAM: Kevdak. 60 feet.

00:33:11.676 --> 00:33:14.994
MATT: 60 feet, you'd, okay, yeah, you can get
right into there and probably still hit him from

00:33:14.994 --> 00:33:17.864
there. Because you have sharpshooter, you don't
have the second increment range, go for it.

00:33:17.864 --> 00:33:19.289
LIAM: Okay, so it's 25.

00:33:19.289 --> 00:33:20.513
MATT: That hits.

00:33:20.513 --> 00:33:27.230
LIAM: Four, oh, hold on, I'll save that four. 20.
Okay.

00:33:27.230 --> 00:33:36.372
TRAVIS: My hands are fucking shaking.

00:33:36.372 --> 00:33:43.240
LIAM: (counting) 31, 37.

00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:47.720
MATT: 37. And half of that is going to put it at
18.

00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:50.956
LIAM: Okay. I'd like to use my bonus action to
throw the next--

00:33:50.956 --> 00:33:54.285
MATT: You had the held-- a held action is just
your action.

00:33:54.285 --> 00:33:56.035
LAURA: Oh, yeah, you did the clicking the boots of
haste already.

00:33:56.035 --> 00:33:58.242
LIAM: I thought that was a gimme-- oh, that's the
bonus action?

00:33:58.242 --> 00:34:04.402
MATT: Well, the idea being that when you hold your
action, you have an action that you hold until it

00:34:04.402 --> 00:34:08.918
triggers. The bonus action's a whole different
thing that you have to take on your turn.

00:34:08.918 --> 00:34:13.370
LIAM: So taking a hold is an action? I don't
understand.

00:34:13.370 --> 00:34:16.001
SAM: Holding your turn loses your bonus action.

00:34:16.001 --> 00:34:20.579
MATT: Yes, essentially you have your action and
your bonus action. Holding your action means you

00:34:20.579 --> 00:34:23.296
hold that one bit of it but your turn still
continues past it.

00:34:23.296 --> 00:34:28.900
LIAM: Okay. Which doorway, where am I on the map,
I can't see myself? Right there? Could I run to

00:34:28.900 --> 00:34:32.615
the corner of the building that the archers are on
and scrabble up the side of it?

00:34:32.615 --> 00:34:33.792
MATT: Over here?

00:34:33.792 --> 00:34:34.904
LIAM: And get to that archer?

00:34:34.904 --> 00:34:36.151
MATT: You can certain try it.

00:34:36.151 --> 00:34:37.894
(laughter)

00:34:37.894 --> 00:34:41.098
MATT: You rush past one of the peasants, fear in
their face, they're confused and looking around

00:34:41.098 --> 00:34:44.304
and you see there's mud and a little trickle of
blood that's dried down their face. As you

00:34:44.304 --> 00:34:47.801
(darting noise) by, they go, (gasps) You don't pay
too much mind to them.

00:34:47.801 --> 00:34:52.086
LIAM: Acrobatics check?

00:34:52.086 --> 00:34:53.530
MATT: Make an acrobatics check.

00:34:53.530 --> 00:34:55.787
LIAM: 30.

00:34:55.787 --> 00:34:58.642
MATT: 30. You manage to make it up to the top.

00:34:58.642 --> 00:35:00.668
LIAM: Do I have an action left?

00:35:00.668 --> 00:35:02.142
MATT: No, you used your action.

00:35:02.142 --> 00:35:05.920
LIAM: Action, action, bonus action with the hasted
boots?

00:35:05.920 --> 00:35:08.385
MATT: Technically, you wouldn't be able to move at
this point even, but I'm letting you do that.

00:35:08.385 --> 00:35:11.977
Usually your move, it's a little weird.

00:35:11.977 --> 00:35:13.329
LIAM: Okay, so I'm outta gas.

00:35:13.329 --> 00:35:14.229
MATT: So yeah.

00:35:14.229 --> 00:35:16.083
TRAVIS: This is the most epic map ever, by the
way.

00:35:16.083 --> 00:35:23.271
MATT: Trinket's just chilling in the house. (sad
bear noise) All righty. So that ends your held

00:35:23.271 --> 00:35:24.992
action, now Grog, you're up.

00:35:24.992 --> 00:35:29.703
TRAVIS: Can I walk around to the front of Kevdak,
please?

00:35:29.703 --> 00:35:31.066
MATT: Okay.

00:35:31.066 --> 00:35:41.120
TRAVIS: Knowing that he pointed up with a hand at
Scanlan's beautiful ass, hand still on his

00:35:41.120 --> 00:35:49.143
greataxe, paralyzed, can I try and rip--
continuing my rage because he hit me last round--

00:35:49.143 --> 00:35:51.670
can I pull the axe from his hand?

00:35:51.670 --> 00:35:55.014
MATT: Go ahead and make an athletics check.

00:35:55.014 --> 00:35:57.492
LIAM: He's going to fail this one.

00:35:57.492 --> 00:36:01.152
MATT: With advantage, because you are raging.

00:36:01.152 --> 00:36:03.462
TRAVIS: 27.

00:36:03.462 --> 00:36:07.979
MATT: Oof! You yank the bloodaxe from his grip.

00:36:07.979 --> 00:36:09.789
SAM: Yes!

00:36:09.789 --> 00:36:14.331
TRAVIS: Because I'm frenzied raging, do I have
another move?

00:36:14.331 --> 00:36:17.988
MATT: I mean--

00:36:17.988 --> 00:36:19.745
TRAVIS: Like, can I hit him with it?

00:36:19.745 --> 00:36:23.932
MATT: Let's check on that, because I don't know if
it's an attack-action-based, because you didn't

00:36:23.932 --> 00:36:26.652
take an attack action last turn, you used your
action to pull it away.

00:36:26.652 --> 00:36:33.248
Looking at that right now, the berserker is
here. Let me see.

00:36:33.248 --> 00:36:37.382
SAM: Lots of rules tonight, guys. Upper-level
rules.

00:36:37.382 --> 00:36:42.582
MATT: Yeah, it's a bonus action, so you could if
you wanted to. The weapon isn't attuned to you, so

00:36:42.582 --> 00:36:45.301
it would just act as a regular axe, possibly.

00:36:45.301 --> 00:36:46.859
ASHLEY: Make it attuned to you!

00:36:46.859 --> 00:36:48.670
MARISHA: That's a short rest.

00:36:48.670 --> 00:36:58.751
TRAVIS: Can I, looking at the axe, say, oh, I do
hope you have a necromancer in your group, because

00:36:58.751 --> 00:37:00.696
I'm looking at a fucking dead man.

00:37:00.696 --> 00:37:02.539
(laughter)

00:37:02.539 --> 00:37:13.205
TRAVIS: Can I aim right above the gauntlet below
the elbow on his left arm? Swing to his side with

00:37:13.205 --> 00:37:14.433
the axe.

00:37:14.433 --> 00:37:21.104
MATT: Like on his left arm? Sure. You're going to
be-- it's going to-- okay, so you're raging.

00:37:21.104 --> 00:37:25.186
Advantage. Well no, reckless attack would be the
advantage if you wanted to.

00:37:25.186 --> 00:37:27.500
TRAVIS: Well, he did it against me so I get it
against him.

00:37:27.500 --> 00:37:33.191
MATT: Well, you have advantage against attacks
with him anyway, because he's paralyzed. I will

00:37:33.191 --> 00:37:40.663
say, it'll have-- okay, you'll have advantage on
the attack, but I will say it's a general minus

00:37:40.663 --> 00:37:45.914
five to the attack, just because it's a very
specific called shot. Go for it.

00:37:45.914 --> 00:37:47.835
MARISHA: Do it, do it.

00:37:47.835 --> 00:37:53.919
TRAVIS: Oh, that's much better. 20.

00:37:53.919 --> 00:37:56.411
MATT: All right. Go ahead and roll damage.

00:37:56.411 --> 00:37:59.040
TRAVIS: I don't know what the attack bonus is with
the axe.

00:37:59.040 --> 00:38:01.416
MATT: It's a d12, and add your strength modifier.

00:38:01.416 --> 00:38:06.170
TRAVIS: Okay. Where is it? Jesus.

00:38:06.170 --> 00:38:10.039
LAURA: That's it, that's it, that top one. That
one. Yeah.

00:38:10.039 --> 00:38:12.415
MATT: Poor d12.

00:38:12.415 --> 00:38:14.171
TRAVIS: This one? Plus what?

00:38:14.171 --> 00:38:17.105
MATT: Strength modifier, which would be three.

00:38:17.105 --> 00:38:18.706
TRAVIS: Ah. So five.

00:38:18.706 --> 00:38:24.385
MATT: Five. Whoosh, you hack the blade and it
sinks quite a bit into the arm right above the

00:38:24.385 --> 00:38:29.445
elbow, you can see as you pull it out, a bit of
bone is exposed from it, but the arm is still

00:38:29.445 --> 00:38:33.995
intact. It wasn't enough damage to go through, but
he's like, (stifled yell)

00:38:33.995 --> 00:38:37.758
TRAVIS: And it hit him, right? So is it an
automatic critical because it hit?

00:38:37.758 --> 00:38:43.717
MATT: Because you were within five feet, so, yes.
So double the dice. So what'd you roll on the dice?

00:38:43.717 --> 00:38:45.291
TRAVIS: So it was a two.

00:38:45.291 --> 00:38:49.885
MATT: So four. So instead it would be seven
damage. Still not enough. But you do do a

00:38:49.885 --> 00:38:56.824
significant amount of damage to his left arm. His
now-open hand's gripping nothing. Actually the one

00:38:56.824 --> 00:38:59.970
hand was holding the axe and the other one was
pointing up, so he's like, (strained sound)

00:38:59.970 --> 00:39:05.136
looking at you right now as the blood begins to
seep out of the fresh wound on his left arm.

00:39:05.136 --> 00:39:10.925
TRAVIS: Do I have any of my movement left, can I
move around behind him? 50.

00:39:10.925 --> 00:39:14.099
MATT: You can move three more spaces, so yeah.

00:39:14.099 --> 00:39:16.216
TRAVIS: I'll either flank him or, yeah.

00:39:16.216 --> 00:39:25.251
MATT: Three. That's where you can get, right
there. Okay. That ends your turn. Surprise back,

00:39:25.251 --> 00:39:26.689
Percy, you're up.

00:39:26.689 --> 00:39:35.621
TALIESIN: This'll be fun, we'll see what happens.
All right, first thing I'm going to do is cast Hex

00:39:35.621 --> 00:39:39.921
on Kevdak, on the asshole, I'm going to Hex him.

00:39:39.921 --> 00:39:41.857
MATT: (laughs) Cast Hex on the asshole.

00:39:41.857 --> 00:39:49.701
TALIESIN: So he is now enveloped in my dark smoke
of death. He's also now at disadvantage on all

00:39:49.701 --> 00:39:50.892
strength checks.

00:39:50.892 --> 00:39:52.229
MATT: Okay.

00:39:52.229 --> 00:39:53.444
TALIESIN: That's a thing.

00:39:53.444 --> 00:40:00.302
MATT: That's the thing with Hex, all right. So
yeah. You watch as Grog walks around him, Grog's

00:40:00.302 --> 00:40:05.260
shadow seems to stretch out from his form, reach
up, and wrap itself around, almost merging with

00:40:05.260 --> 00:40:10.538
the tattoos across his torso. The actual bear
tattoo almost seems to be almost

00:40:10.538 --> 00:40:12.292
covered with shadow.

00:40:12.292 --> 00:40:14.458
TRAVIS: I love you.

00:40:14.458 --> 00:40:20.409
TALIESIN: I know, I'm so happy. I'm going to take
a little step back to get a slight bit of cover

00:40:20.409 --> 00:40:24.826
from those archers for when they start hearing the
big bang-bangs coming from the house, to get

00:40:24.826 --> 00:40:26.820
half-cover, so I can still--

00:40:26.820 --> 00:40:28.181
MATT: Which way are you going?

00:40:28.181 --> 00:40:32.372
TALIESIN: I'm going from my current vantage point,
to about seven o'clock, eight o'clock.

00:40:32.372 --> 00:40:33.389
MATT: About here?

00:40:33.389 --> 00:40:38.317
TALIESIN: Yeah, about there. For a little bit of
cover from the arrows. And I can still see Kevdak.

00:40:38.317 --> 00:40:39.929
MATT: Yes, you can.

00:40:39.929 --> 00:40:47.228
TALIESIN: So if I wanted to take my little pistol
and start carving a little-- and I've got a nice

00:40:47.228 --> 00:40:53.605
little chunk of bone I can see in his arm-- can I
take a sharpshooter disadvantage to hit that point?

00:40:53.605 --> 00:40:57.918
MATT: You could. I'll move this board a little bit
so you guys can see better.

00:40:57.918 --> 00:41:03.086
TALIESIN: So I'm going to shoot with sharpshooter
specifically for his arm.

00:41:03.086 --> 00:41:07.395
MATT: His left arm, you do not have a view on it
right away.

00:41:07.395 --> 00:41:08.454
TALIESIN: Oh.

00:41:08.454 --> 00:41:10.564
MATT: I would say from your perspective on the
rooftop, because he was turned this way and is

00:41:10.564 --> 00:41:14.204
facing this way, you would have a big ol' view of
his back and shoulders.

00:41:14.204 --> 00:41:16.412
TALIESIN: Okay. I'm going to take a shot for the
elbow.

00:41:16.412 --> 00:41:17.686
MATT: On this arm?

00:41:17.686 --> 00:41:19.405
TALIESIN: I'm going to try, yeah, on the visible
elbow.

00:41:19.405 --> 00:41:20.541
MATT: Okay.

00:41:20.541 --> 00:41:23.882
TALIESIN: I'm going to sharpshooter through that
shit, see what happens.

00:41:23.882 --> 00:41:26.387
MATT: Go for it.

00:41:26.387 --> 00:41:29.475
TALIESIN: Okay. And I'm happy if you want to put
any weird disadvantage--

00:41:29.475 --> 00:41:31.456
MATT: You have advantage on the attack because
he's paralyzed.

00:41:31.456 --> 00:41:36.494
TALIESIN: No, I don't, because I'm at distance. Or
do I have advantage be--

00:41:36.494 --> 00:41:37.678
MARISHA: He's paralyzed.

00:41:37.678 --> 00:41:39.441
TALIESIN: Oh, he's paralyzed! I have advantage on
the attack.

00:41:39.441 --> 00:41:42.606
MATT: You have advantage on that, and then you
have disadvantage because it's a called shot, plus

00:41:42.606 --> 00:41:43.636
minus five.

00:41:43.636 --> 00:41:45.572
TALIESIN: Okay, that's fine. But I get the bonus
ten points still.

00:41:45.572 --> 00:41:46.728
MATT: You would if you hit.

00:41:46.728 --> 00:41:50.923
TALIESIN: Okay. All right. That's fine. Natural
20.

00:41:50.923 --> 00:41:52.923
ALL: Oh!

00:41:52.923 --> 00:41:54.590
TRAVIS: Oh my god, are you serious?

00:41:54.590 --> 00:41:55.859
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah.

00:41:55.859 --> 00:42:02.178
TALIESIN: Should've used the big gun, really. All
right, that's okay. So that's, oh, hello baby,

00:42:02.178 --> 00:42:04.093
you're over here. Actually, I'm going to use the
pink one--

00:42:04.093 --> 00:42:05.716
MATT: What's the first range increment for the
pistol?

00:42:05.716 --> 00:42:07.419
TALIESIN: 400 feet.

00:42:07.419 --> 00:42:08.725
MATT: Yeah, okay.

00:42:08.725 --> 00:42:09.910
TALIESIN: I'm scary.

00:42:09.910 --> 00:42:11.295
MATT: Gun. Go for it.

00:42:11.295 --> 00:42:15.633
TALIESIN: I know. Sorry. I know, I thought about
that. Come on, baby, no whammies.

00:42:15.633 --> 00:42:17.994
Do I double the dice?

00:42:17.994 --> 00:42:19.712
MATT: Double the dice and then add the modifier to
it.

00:42:19.712 --> 00:42:26.552
TALIESIN: Okay, so that's 16, (counting), 32
points of damage for the first shot.

00:42:26.552 --> 00:42:29.445
MATT: 32 points of damage? Okay, half of that into
16.

00:42:29.445 --> 00:42:39.743
(gunshot) You watch as the blast hits into the
side of his arm. The arm actually hyperextends and

00:42:39.743 --> 00:42:47.112
part of the bone shoots out the side, and he goes
and screams out. The arm does not, you know, it

00:42:47.112 --> 00:42:48.752
looks like it's in a rough place.

00:42:48.752 --> 00:42:50.553
TALIESIN: I'm shooting again. Same thing.

00:42:50.553 --> 00:42:53.793
LAURA: Oh my god, he's going to shoot his arm
off.

00:42:53.793 --> 00:42:57.898
TALIESIN: 17, good enough. 17, I'm rolling good.

00:42:57.898 --> 00:43:00.068
MATT: With the disadvantage?

00:43:00.068 --> 00:43:05.068
TALIESIN: No, it cancels out because he's-- it's
no advantage, no disadvantage, right?

00:43:05.068 --> 00:43:09.883
MATT: You got advantage because he's paralyzed,
yeah. You're right, you're right. Hold Person,

00:43:09.883 --> 00:43:11.556
man. Nasty.

00:43:11.556 --> 00:43:13.173
TALIESIN: (counting) 25 to hit. That hits.

00:43:13.173 --> 00:43:16.198
SAM: This is like 127 Hours, except with a gun.

00:43:16.198 --> 00:43:19.536
TALIESIN: That's the title of my, '127 Hours With
a Gun'.

00:43:19.536 --> 00:43:21.385
LIAM: And remember, this is happening in about ten
seconds.

00:43:21.385 --> 00:43:26.795
TALIESIN: I know. I actually, also, I rolled the
wrong die, he didn't take nearly what, that's

00:43:26.795 --> 00:43:28.022
okay, so here.

00:43:28.022 --> 00:43:29.139
MATT: Too late.

00:43:29.139 --> 00:43:31.345
TALIESIN: I know, too late. I know. I fucked that
up.

00:43:31.345 --> 00:43:32.440
MARISHA: You rolled four, though.

00:43:32.440 --> 00:43:39.897
TALIESIN: Yeah, I know, so I did okay. Five, six,
seven, eight-- (counting) 24 points of damage.

00:43:39.897 --> 00:43:46.506
MATT: 24 points of damage. So minus that to 12,
this is the same elbow?

00:43:46.506 --> 00:43:47.722
TALIESIN: Same elbow.

00:43:47.722 --> 00:43:55.515
MATT: (gunshot) You see now, the arm actually is
dangling now from some sort of sinew and bone that

00:43:55.515 --> 00:43:58.426
is barely keeping it on at this point.

00:43:58.426 --> 00:44:02.764
TALIESIN: Do you have a d6 that I can borrow? I'm
going to go for my third, can I borrow your pink

00:44:02.764 --> 00:44:09.134
d6? I want to Bowie this shit. Yeah. I want to be
flamboyant as fuck. All right. Going to call it.

00:44:09.134 --> 00:44:15.457
14. (counting) 24 to hit.

00:44:15.457 --> 00:44:16.765
MATT: That hits.

00:44:16.765 --> 00:44:27.734
TALIESIN: Goodbye, elbow. Eh, well, not bad.
(counting) 23 points of damage.

00:44:27.734 --> 00:44:39.539
MATT: Lower that to 11. Okay. This shot hits the
elbow again, actually destroying a big portion of

00:44:39.539 --> 00:44:47.239
the upper forearm. It's now essentially but a
single leftover bicep muscle that's holding it in

00:44:47.239 --> 00:44:50.867
place as blood's pouring from the wound right
now.

00:44:50.867 --> 00:44:52.307
LIAM: Who wants bacon?

00:44:52.307 --> 00:44:53.580
TALIESIN: All right. I'm calling it for now.

00:44:53.580 --> 00:44:56.292
MATT: All right, that ends Percy's turn. Keyleth,
you're up.

00:44:56.292 --> 00:45:06.696
MARISHA: Okay. I'm going to roll up this roof like
a big, ominous fog cloud. And come up, and I want

00:45:06.696 --> 00:45:09.408
to do a Whirlwind on those two archers up there.

00:45:09.408 --> 00:45:10.964
MATT: Up here? Are you coming from up here, you
mean?

00:45:10.964 --> 00:45:12.048
MARISHA: Yup.

00:45:12.048 --> 00:45:16.878
MATT: All righty. Let's take this here.

00:45:16.878 --> 00:45:19.883
MARISHA: So they must make a DC 13 strength saving
throw.

00:45:19.883 --> 00:45:22.711
TALIESIN: I haven't burned any grit yet, I'm so
excited.

00:45:22.711 --> 00:45:28.120
MATT: Balancing here, there we go. A DC what? Oh
no! Keyleth's dead.

00:45:28.120 --> 00:45:30.145
LAURA and ASHLEY: No!

00:45:30.145 --> 00:45:34.929
TALIESIN: Ironically, crushed by a tree. Curse
you, nature.

00:45:34.929 --> 00:45:36.869
MATT: All right, what's the DC on that?

00:45:36.869 --> 00:45:39.549
MARISHA: The thing that she loved killed her. 13.
Strength.

00:45:39.549 --> 00:45:40.419
MATT: Strength?

00:45:40.419 --> 00:45:42.341
TALIESIN: Strength check or save?

00:45:42.341 --> 00:45:44.524
MATT: This is a saving throw.

00:45:44.524 --> 00:45:46.416
TALIESIN: Oh, damn. Does he still have
disadvantage?

00:45:46.416 --> 00:45:48.499
SAM: Except she's not attacking him.

00:45:48.499 --> 00:45:51.042
MATT: Okay, one of them fails, one of them
succeeds.

00:45:51.042 --> 00:45:58.108
MARISHA: Okay, so the one that fails takes 3d8
plus two bludgeoning damage, which is pretty good.

00:45:58.108 --> 00:46:08.032
11, and he's flung 20 feet away. In a random
direction.

00:46:08.032 --> 00:46:13.563
MATT: In a random direction? All right. Let's go
ahead and see what direction, that's a one, so he

00:46:13.563 --> 00:46:16.558
gets flung this way 20 feet?

00:46:16.558 --> 00:46:17.788
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:46:17.788 --> 00:46:21.793
MATT: Five, ten, 15, 20. (yells, impact). Falls
prone there.

00:46:21.793 --> 00:46:27.574
MARISHA: He takes another 1d6 bludgeoning damage
for every ten feet he was thrown.

00:46:27.574 --> 00:46:34.788
MATT: Yes, that would be-- 2d6, that puts it at, I
rolled double sixes on that, so that's 12 points

00:46:34.788 --> 00:46:35.872
of damage.

00:46:35.872 --> 00:46:36.972
TRAVIS: Yeah yeah!

00:46:36.972 --> 00:46:38.047
MARISHA: And he's knocked prone.

00:46:38.047 --> 00:46:39.144
MATT: Yes he is.

00:46:39.144 --> 00:46:40.424
MARISHA: And the other guy--

00:46:40.424 --> 00:46:42.483
MATT: (yells, impact), as this whirlwind of--

00:46:42.483 --> 00:46:45.613
LAURA and ASHLEY: Ow ow ow ow.

00:46:45.613 --> 00:46:51.251
MATT: Yeah, as you see, of the roof itself up
there, portions of the rooftop are cracking off

00:46:51.251 --> 00:46:56.048
and spinning into the void of wind that Keyleth's
currently creating within herself. Portions of the

00:46:56.048 --> 00:47:01.428
tree branches are swirling into it as various
leaves and dead plant life that had been scattered

00:47:01.428 --> 00:47:04.930
around the roof are all filling this giant vortex
that has appeared on the roof of the Margrave's

00:47:04.930 --> 00:47:08.440
house, tearing into both of the archers. One of
them flung off, landing face-first, the other one--

00:47:08.440 --> 00:47:09.602
MARISHA: Takes half damage.

00:47:09.602 --> 00:47:17.903
MATT: Takes half damage. Okay. All right. Five
points of bludgeoning damage. All right. Does that

00:47:17.903 --> 00:47:19.021
finish your turn?

00:47:19.021 --> 00:47:19.975
MARISHA: Yup.

00:47:19.975 --> 00:47:21.247
MATT: All right. Pike, you're up.

00:47:21.247 --> 00:47:22.665
SAM: Yeah, Pike!

00:47:22.665 --> 00:47:29.930
ASHLEY: Since I can't reach Kevdak, I'm going to
send over a Spiritual Weapon.

00:47:29.930 --> 00:47:32.089
MATT: Okay.

00:47:32.089 --> 00:47:34.794
ASHLEY: Range is 60 feet.

00:47:34.794 --> 00:47:43.900
MATT: Spiritual Weapon. As a cleric. That's a
level... two?

00:47:43.900 --> 00:47:47.677
ASHLEY: I'm going to do it at a higher level, I'm
going to do it at a level five.

00:47:47.677 --> 00:47:50.400
TALIESIN: Five? Five?

00:47:50.400 --> 00:47:52.741
ASHLEY: It's a big one.

00:47:52.741 --> 00:47:54.841
(laughter)

00:47:54.841 --> 00:47:58.521
LIAM: In the shape of Madeline Kahn and it's out
for blood.

00:47:58.521 --> 00:48:00.564
MATT: We'll use this metal d20, where do you want
to place it?

00:48:00.564 --> 00:48:04.227
ASHLEY: Right above him.

00:48:04.227 --> 00:48:07.175
MATT: We'll say in this central area there.

00:48:07.175 --> 00:48:11.702
ASHLEY: It's, I don't even know, a big--

00:48:11.702 --> 00:48:17.498
MATT: What weapon of Sarenrae's retribution would
you want to summon in spiritual form upon Kevdak?

00:48:17.498 --> 00:48:18.673
SAM: A beartrap!

00:48:18.673 --> 00:48:21.003
ASHLEY: I just want it to be a big sword.

00:48:21.003 --> 00:48:28.853
MATT: Okay, so a large greathand sword, almost a
light reflection mirror-image of the Craven Edge

00:48:28.853 --> 00:48:30.500
that nearly tore the soul from your friend--

00:48:30.500 --> 00:48:31.647
TRAVIS: Yes!

00:48:31.647 --> 00:48:37.738
MATT: You see a large light blade of Sarenrae's
wrath emerges out of the stonework in the center

00:48:37.738 --> 00:48:43.996
of the square. Floats in the air for a second, and
you want to go ahead and make that, and this is

00:48:43.996 --> 00:48:45.233
your bonus action--

00:48:45.233 --> 00:48:47.249
ASHLEY: This is a bonus action, yeah.

00:48:47.249 --> 00:48:50.471
MATT: If you want to use your action to cast a
spell, you can't do higher than a level two right

00:48:50.471 --> 00:48:56.721
now. Because of the limitations on spells in our
homebrew. However, do you want to have it attack

00:48:56.721 --> 00:48:57.841
Kevdak?

00:48:57.841 --> 00:48:58.735
ASHLEY: Yeah!

00:48:58.735 --> 00:49:02.050
MATT: All right. Go ahead and roll for the damage.
With advantage.

00:49:02.050 --> 00:49:05.930
ASHLEY: That would be a natural 20.

00:49:05.930 --> 00:49:08.966
LAURA: C'mon, Pike!

00:49:08.966 --> 00:49:11.649
ASHLEY: All right, okay.

00:49:11.649 --> 00:49:13.991
MARISHA: We talked for a week!

00:49:13.991 --> 00:49:16.696
TALIESIN: Hundreds of text messages.

00:49:16.696 --> 00:49:20.393
MATT: Wait 'til the surprise round's over.

00:49:20.393 --> 00:49:23.367
LIAM: You mean 30 seconds with the earring.

00:49:23.367 --> 00:49:26.922
MATT: All right, so, you're looking at 4d8.

00:49:26.922 --> 00:49:31.026
ASHLEY: Okay, I'm going to use Divine Strike
to make it 5d8.

00:49:31.026 --> 00:49:35.074
MATT: Well, that's only on your melee attack, it's
not your actual spells.

00:49:35.074 --> 00:49:36.751
LIAM: It's all right, you're already a badass.

00:49:36.751 --> 00:49:40.448
MATT: So roll 4d8, multiply that by two.

00:49:40.448 --> 00:49:42.471
SAM: Multiply by two.

00:49:42.471 --> 00:49:43.701
MATT: Critical hit.

00:49:43.701 --> 00:49:45.708
SAM: Oh my god.

00:49:45.708 --> 00:49:48.469
ASHLEY: What did you say?

00:49:48.469 --> 00:49:50.587
MATT: You roll 4d8 times two.

00:49:50.587 --> 00:49:52.068
ASHLEY: 22.

00:49:52.068 --> 00:49:53.987
MATT: So 22 plus your wisdom modifier.

00:49:53.987 --> 00:49:56.248
ASHLEY: Is 30.

00:49:56.248 --> 00:49:58.827
MATT: So 30. Half that to 15.

00:49:58.827 --> 00:49:59.966
ASHLEY: Aw.

00:49:59.966 --> 00:50:01.529
SAM: Hey, that's good!

00:50:01.529 --> 00:50:07.459
MATT: As the blade strikes down onto the now
currently brutalized Kevdak who is still held in

00:50:07.459 --> 00:50:14.021
place angrily being whaled upon by the majority of
you. So what else do you want to do

00:50:14.021 --> 00:50:15.482
this turn, if anything?

00:50:15.482 --> 00:50:17.042
LAURA: Oh yeah, you can still do other things!

00:50:17.042 --> 00:50:18.381
MATT: You can move, you have an action.

00:50:18.381 --> 00:50:19.516
LAURA: This is a bonus!

00:50:19.516 --> 00:50:21.796
MATT: It lasts for a minute, and it's not
concentration.

00:50:21.796 --> 00:50:23.677
ASHLEY: Yeah, I should probably, I should
probably--

00:50:23.677 --> 00:50:26.003
MATT: As a bonus action you can make it move and
attack every round, so.

00:50:26.003 --> 00:50:34.185
ASHLEY: Awesome. Okay, so I'm going to, would it
be possible to get down on that bottom roof and hide?

00:50:34.185 --> 00:50:35.198
MATT: Here?

00:50:35.198 --> 00:50:36.106
ASHLEY: Yeah.

00:50:36.106 --> 00:50:37.608
MATT: You could. Make an acrobatics check.

00:50:37.608 --> 00:50:39.199
TALIESIN: Clang clang clang.

00:50:39.199 --> 00:50:48.087
LAURA: You're going to roll, roll for it! I can't
even read that. Oh.

00:50:48.087 --> 00:50:51.858
MATT: What's the total?

00:50:51.858 --> 00:50:54.154
ASHLEY: Five.

00:50:54.154 --> 00:51:02.799
MATT: Fresh off the 20. Pike looks over the edge,
leaps, hits a little bit to the side, her feet

00:51:02.799 --> 00:51:08.055
actually break-- from the weight of the armor and
the angle you hit, break some of the shingles on

00:51:08.055 --> 00:51:12.760
the rooftop and you end up slipping onto your
shield and you slide off the roof.

00:51:12.760 --> 00:51:13.990
LAURA: No!

00:51:13.990 --> 00:51:16.622
MATT: And end up on the ground there.

00:51:16.622 --> 00:51:22.864
MATT: You take seven points of damage from the
fall, and you're knocked prone currently on the

00:51:22.864 --> 00:51:29.149
ground as you now see staring at you-- You're
prone. A number of these angry Herd members that

00:51:29.149 --> 00:51:32.952
are all intent on murder at what's been
happening.

00:51:32.952 --> 00:51:34.989
LIAM: I still think you're really cool.

00:51:34.989 --> 00:51:37.523
ASHLEY: It's okay, I can run out of there with my
Sprinter's Boots.

00:51:37.523 --> 00:51:43.898
MATT: All right, Pike, that ends your turn. Now. I
get to do some more stuff.

00:51:43.898 --> 00:51:45.804
TALIESIN: She's made of armor.

00:51:45.804 --> 00:51:50.579
SAM: They're coming for you, Pike. You got a
reaction or something?

00:51:50.579 --> 00:51:52.870
LAURA: Seriously. Pike, they're all coming for
you.

00:51:52.870 --> 00:51:57.741
SAM: Yeah. You're dead. Do you have a reaction of
some sort? Do you have a reaction?

00:51:57.741 --> 00:51:59.885
MARISHA: Don't die, you are not dying tonight.

00:51:59.885 --> 00:52:02.368
ASHLEY: It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, we're
going to be fine, we're going to be fine.

00:52:02.368 --> 00:52:06.599
TALIESIN: She's made of armor and they're people
with sticks, with sharp sticks.

00:52:06.599 --> 00:52:08.233
SAM: Oh my god, she's going to die.

00:52:08.233 --> 00:52:10.068
MARISHA: She's not going to die, she's not going
to die.

00:52:10.068 --> 00:52:11.239
SAM: Love of my life.

00:52:11.239 --> 00:52:12.534
TALIESIN: Not in one round.

00:52:12.534 --> 00:52:14.149
MARISHA: There's only one guy who ran up to her.

00:52:14.149 --> 00:52:17.301
LAURA: Scanlan, would it say 'reaction' here?

00:52:17.301 --> 00:52:20.318
SAM: She knows what her reactions are. You do have
one.

00:52:20.318 --> 00:52:25.787
MATT: All right, so. Three of these individuals,
some of which you may have passed in your time,

00:52:25.787 --> 00:52:30.888
and two of which you see are members that were
absorbed into the tribe from what was previously

00:52:30.888 --> 00:52:37.619
the Rivermaw tribe, (roar) give off these angry
roars and go into an immediate rage, breaking the

00:52:37.619 --> 00:52:40.877
surprise element, and charge. Three of them on
you, one of them goes darting across the field

00:52:40.877 --> 00:52:49.720
right towards you, Pike. With that, these, pull
out this sheet here, these Herd of the Storm

00:52:49.720 --> 00:52:57.885
warmongers are going to go apeshit on your ass.
Grog, that's six attacks on you. Because of the

00:52:57.885 --> 00:53:01.265
flanking rules, that's going to put four of them
at advantage.

00:53:01.265 --> 00:53:05.133
SAM: Oh my god.

00:53:05.133 --> 00:53:09.869
MATT: First one is going to be an 18 to hit?

00:53:09.869 --> 00:53:11.164
TRAVIS: Misses.

00:53:11.164 --> 00:53:14.562
MATT: Misses. The first one goes and swings
towards you, and you duck underneath it and

00:53:14.562 --> 00:53:17.961
whoomph, misses you by a mile. However, as that's
happening, another blade comes the other

00:53:17.961 --> 00:53:21.278
direction, that's going to be a 25?

00:53:21.278 --> 00:53:22.691
TRAVIS: That hits.

00:53:22.691 --> 00:53:33.521
MATT: Natural 20. Third one, so one hit. Second
one's going to be a 28, so that's two hits and a

00:53:33.521 --> 00:53:38.279
critical. And then one that doesn't have advantage
on you with both strikes is going to be 23, that

00:53:38.279 --> 00:53:41.028
hits, and a 16 that misses. So.

00:53:41.028 --> 00:53:42.643
SAM: You do have inspiration.

00:53:42.643 --> 00:53:43.851
MATT: Four hits and one crit.

00:53:43.851 --> 00:53:46.825
TRAVIS: I can't use it on this stuff, though. Only
when I attack.

00:53:46.825 --> 00:53:55.512
MATT: All righty. So, the four hits first. That's
going to be 15 points of slashing damage.

00:53:55.512 --> 00:53:57.285
TRAVIS: Reduced to seven?

00:53:57.285 --> 00:54:04.697
MATT: Reduced to seven. Right. Ooh, 19 points of
slashing damage, reduced to eight.

00:54:04.697 --> 00:54:06.006
TRAVIS: Okay.

00:54:06.006 --> 00:54:15.405
MATT: 13 points of slashing damage, reduced to
six. And another 13, reduced to six. Now for the crit.

00:54:15.405 --> 00:54:20.608
TALIESIN: I would like to remind you that potions
are a bonus action. Thank you.

00:54:20.608 --> 00:54:24.852
MATT: (counting) That's going to be 22 points of
slashing damage on that, reduced to 11.

00:54:24.852 --> 00:54:27.300
TALIESIN: Whew, you are a tank.

00:54:27.300 --> 00:54:29.898
LAURA: Unless he's unconscious.

00:54:29.898 --> 00:54:34.859
MATT: Pike. So you're now surrounded on all sides,
Kevdak's there before you, but you've now been

00:54:34.859 --> 00:54:39.563
completely swarmed in by three of these entities.
Pike, this one rushes towards you, (battle-cry),

00:54:39.563 --> 00:54:43.929
this female half-elf, you can see a line of drool
from her face with the sheer speed she was running

00:54:43.929 --> 00:54:48.328
and the froth that was forming at the corner of
it. She leaps into the air, blade in front, and is

00:54:48.328 --> 00:54:55.751
going to come down on your tiny form. (counting)
That's 28 to hit on the first one.

00:54:55.751 --> 00:54:57.024
ASHLEY: Yeah.

00:54:57.024 --> 00:55:00.431
MATT: And a 28. Rolled 18s on both advantage
ones.

00:55:00.431 --> 00:55:01.930
ASHLEY: Okay okay okay okay.

00:55:01.930 --> 00:55:09.047
MATT: Right, so two hits on you, you take 19
points of slashing damage from the first strike.

00:55:09.047 --> 00:55:11.469
ASHLEY: That's not halved? No, it's only halved
because he's--

00:55:11.469 --> 00:55:12.788
MATT: Only because he's raging.

00:55:12.788 --> 00:55:14.183
ASHLEY: I'm a barbarian, too!

00:55:14.183 --> 00:55:15.966
(laughter)

00:55:15.966 --> 00:55:26.154
MATT: 19 on the first strike, the second one is
13, so that's a total of 32 points of slashing

00:55:26.154 --> 00:55:30.952
damage to you. And that's going to end the
barbarians' turn, everyone else finishes out

00:55:30.952 --> 00:55:35.024
surprise round, now we're back into full
initiative, everyone's in play, top of the round,

00:55:35.024 --> 00:55:36.149
Vex, you're up.

00:55:36.149 --> 00:55:48.297
LAURA: Okay. If I aim an arrow, it's at
disadvantage?

00:55:48.297 --> 00:55:53.211
MATT: If you aimed specifically for something? It
would be at disadvantage and a minus five to hit.

00:55:53.211 --> 00:55:59.249
LAURA: Okay. I'm going to cast, I'm going to
cast--

00:55:59.249 --> 00:56:03.945
MATT: I mean, he's paralyzed, so it would have
advantage, so it would cancel out, it would be

00:56:03.945 --> 00:56:05.515
just a regular attack at minus five.

00:56:05.515 --> 00:56:06.591
LAURA: Okay, here's my question.

00:56:06.591 --> 00:56:07.554
MATT: Yes?

00:56:07.554 --> 00:56:13.668
LAURA: The siege arrow that Percy gave me, is that
a magical weapon or a technical weapon?

00:56:13.668 --> 00:56:19.468
MATT: It's a technical weapon, it's used
essentially against structures, objects.

00:56:19.468 --> 00:56:20.662
LAURA: So just structures.

00:56:20.662 --> 00:56:24.691
MATT: It's an explosive in an arrow that is used
primarily to destroy structures, yeah.

00:56:24.691 --> 00:56:25.989
LAURA: So it wouldn't harm people?

00:56:25.989 --> 00:56:28.619
MATT: I mean, it would hurt people like a regular
arrow, and it might do a little bit extra, but--

00:56:28.619 --> 00:56:30.109
LAURA: Not anything crazy?

00:56:30.109 --> 00:56:34.599
MATT: Not that you know of, you don't have a full
understanding of what the arrow's capable of. You

00:56:34.599 --> 00:56:35.844
did not create it.

00:56:35.844 --> 00:56:38.015
TALIESIN: I gave you the big debrief with the
arrow, I gave you the how-to--

00:56:38.015 --> 00:56:39.610
LAURA: I know I know I know I know.

00:56:39.610 --> 00:56:40.824
MATT: What're you doing? Hurry.

00:56:40.824 --> 00:56:42.534
LAURA: Okay okay okay! Okay!

00:56:42.534 --> 00:56:43.659
MATT: Vax, you're on deck.

00:56:43.659 --> 00:56:51.176
LAURA: I'm going to cast Hail of Thorns at third
level into a group, the group. At Kevdak.

00:56:51.176 --> 00:56:53.779
TRAVIS: No. Whatever you're going to do. Just do
it.

00:56:53.779 --> 00:56:58.159
LAURA: Just do it? I'm going to do it at Kevdak
and anything that is close to him gets hit.

00:56:58.159 --> 00:56:59.726
Anything--

00:56:59.726 --> 00:57:03.514
MATT: Within five feet of him? And you're doing it
at what level?

00:57:03.514 --> 00:57:04.859
LAURA: At level three.

00:57:04.859 --> 00:57:11.756
MATT: Level three, so that's 3d10 points of piercing
damage. All righty. Okay. So go ahead and make an

00:57:11.756 --> 00:57:18.345
attack against Kevdak, that is going to be-- Yeah,
with advantage because it's not an aimed shot, so

00:57:18.345 --> 00:57:20.077
go ahead and take it.

00:57:20.077 --> 00:57:22.180
LAURA: Natural 20.

00:57:22.180 --> 00:57:24.301
MATT: Are you serious?

00:57:24.301 --> 00:57:27.751
TALIESIN: You've been doing it all night, too. I
figure, you know, it's only fair.

00:57:27.751 --> 00:57:30.179
MATT: I've gotten like one.

00:57:30.179 --> 00:57:32.701
TALIESIN: No, you've had more than one. We've been
counting.

00:57:32.701 --> 00:57:33.723
MATT: I've had two?

00:57:33.723 --> 00:57:36.345
LIAM: Two for Kevdak's initiative and two for
here.

00:57:36.345 --> 00:57:39.733
MATT: That's true, that's true, I actually,
could've been worse. All right, so. Go ahead and

00:57:39.733 --> 00:57:44.941
roll against Kevdak, that is going to be six, or
3d10 times two.

00:57:44.941 --> 00:57:47.168
LAURA: Oh, 3d10? Oh.

00:57:47.168 --> 00:57:50.255
SAM: Yeah, oh.

00:57:50.255 --> 00:57:59.903
LAURA: 20, plus an additional-- oh no, Hunter's
Mark dropped because it's a concentration. But I

00:57:59.903 --> 00:58:07.697
am sneaking-attacking. An additional six. Oh,
that's 12 then, because it doubles the dice.

00:58:07.697 --> 00:58:08.916
MATT: Correct, yeah.

00:58:08.916 --> 00:58:11.393
LAURA: So that's 32 points of damage.

00:58:11.393 --> 00:58:16.602
MATT: 32 on him, reduce that to 16 piercing. All
righty. And then all the rest of them have to make

00:58:16.602 --> 00:58:20.047
dexterity saving throws against your spell DC.
What's your spell DC? This includes Grog.

00:58:20.047 --> 00:58:21.256
LAURA: 15.

00:58:21.256 --> 00:58:22.563
SAM: C'mon, Groggy.

00:58:22.563 --> 00:58:23.733
TRAVIS: What, what was it?

00:58:23.733 --> 00:58:24.696
LAURA: 15.

00:58:24.696 --> 00:58:25.957
TRAVIS: What 15?

00:58:25.957 --> 00:58:27.898
SAM: You got to make a save to get outta the way.

00:58:27.898 --> 00:58:30.188
With inspiration.

00:58:30.188 --> 00:58:33.592
LAURA: With inspiration.

00:58:33.592 --> 00:58:41.367
TRAVIS: 17.

00:58:41.367 --> 00:58:44.235
MATT: All right, so half damage to you, Grog.

00:58:44.235 --> 00:58:45.300
TRAVIS: Okay.

00:58:45.300 --> 00:58:50.581
MATT: Which is halved again, one quarter, because
there's a whole bunch of raging individuals.

00:58:50.581 --> 00:58:53.262
TRAVIS: 32, halved is 16, which is eight.

00:58:53.262 --> 00:58:55.963
MATT: Two of them succeed as well and also take
eight damage.

00:58:55.963 --> 00:58:59.388
LAURA: They're barbarians as well?

00:58:59.388 --> 00:59:01.394
SAM: They're raging? They're raging.

00:59:01.394 --> 00:59:10.199
MATT: And then one of them takes full damage at
16. All righty. So. That concludes your action.

00:59:10.199 --> 00:59:12.199
You want to move, or you going to stay where you
are?

00:59:12.199 --> 00:59:19.610
LAURA: If I fly on my broom, can I go down and
grab Pike? As an action? I mean, as a movement?

00:59:19.610 --> 00:59:25.068
MATT: It's going to be hard-pressed for you this
turn to pull out your broom. I mean, you've been

00:59:25.068 --> 00:59:28.186
clutching your broom with you this whole time, you
leaned it up against the wall as you hid down there?

00:59:28.186 --> 00:59:34.709
LAURA: Okay. I'm going to stay where I am. And I'm
going to hide against the window so nobody can see me.

00:59:34.709 --> 00:59:36.624
MATT: Okay.

00:59:36.624 --> 00:59:38.328
LAURA: Against on-- yeah, like that.

00:59:38.328 --> 00:59:46.127
MATT: That brings us to the next in the initiative
order, Vax.

00:59:46.127 --> 00:59:50.654
LIAM: All right, I want to preface this with, last
week I misspoke, I thought I had one Luck left as

00:59:50.654 --> 00:59:55.276
I used it, but I got it backwards, so I have one
Luck left this week in case I want to use it.

00:59:55.276 --> 00:59:56.308
MATT: Okay.

00:59:56.308 --> 00:59:57.849
SAM: Go back and look at the videotape.

00:59:57.849 --> 01:00:03.143
LIAM: You can. Well no, I said the wrong thing.
But anyway, I want to use my first action to shove

01:00:03.143 --> 01:00:05.009
that archer backward off the roof.

01:00:05.009 --> 01:00:06.365
MATT: Shove them?

01:00:06.365 --> 01:00:07.680
LIAM: Yeah, shove them off.

01:00:07.680 --> 01:00:16.117
MATT: All right, let's go ahead and do a shove
action. Find myself on this one here-- all right,

01:00:16.117 --> 01:00:20.621
so, for shove-- I need you to go ahead and--

01:00:20.621 --> 01:00:22.175
LIAM: Strength?

01:00:22.175 --> 01:00:23.742
MATT: --make an athletics check.

01:00:23.742 --> 01:00:24.879
LIAM: Athletics check.

01:00:24.879 --> 01:00:25.986
MATT: Yes.

01:00:25.986 --> 01:00:28.464
LIAM: I'm going to trigger the Luck right now.

01:00:28.464 --> 01:00:29.511
MATT: All right.

01:00:29.511 --> 01:00:32.079
LIAM: That helped it, yeah. That gets it to 20.

01:00:32.079 --> 01:00:36.912
MATT: To 20? That's going to be a 12.

01:00:36.912 --> 01:00:38.536
LAURA and MARISHA: Yay!

01:00:38.536 --> 01:00:45.140
MATT: So you shove it five feet. This way? All
right, so it's going to go ahead and make an

01:00:45.140 --> 01:00:46.073
acrobatics--

01:00:46.073 --> 01:00:47.656
LIAM: Ah, no, towards you, Matt, was my intention,
yeah.

01:00:47.656 --> 01:00:52.352
MATT: Towards me? All right, this way. Shove, they
do make an acrobatics check but they do land off

01:00:52.352 --> 01:01:00.813
the side here. So they take eight points of damage
being pushed off the side. All righty.

01:01:00.813 --> 01:01:02.904
SAM: This board is incredible.

01:01:02.904 --> 01:01:07.721
MATT: So that person's now fallen out of sight
(yells), off the side.

01:01:07.721 --> 01:01:11.975
LIAM: Now, question: am I able to use my bonus
action to hide behind that chimney from Kevdak's

01:01:11.975 --> 01:01:16.314
view, and the archers are, am I able to do that?
Just with Kevdak?

01:01:16.314 --> 01:01:19.368
MATT: Yeah, the chimney should offer you enough,
and you have a tree between the two of you

01:01:19.368 --> 01:01:20.288
anyway.

01:01:20.288 --> 01:01:22.395
LIAM: Okay. So I hide behind the chimney.

01:01:22.395 --> 01:01:24.134
MATT: Make a dexterity, make a stealth check.

01:01:24.134 --> 01:01:27.537
LIAM: Stealth check. That's 25.

01:01:27.537 --> 01:01:28.531
MATT: Okay.

01:01:28.531 --> 01:01:32.414
LIAM: And I would like to use my last action to
throw at Kevdak, so I should still have advantage,

01:01:32.414 --> 01:01:38.493
because he's held, and I should have, if I'm
hiding, it's a sneak attack, isn't it?

01:01:38.493 --> 01:01:41.636
MATT: Well, sneak attack is if it's an attack with
advantage anyway.

01:01:41.636 --> 01:01:44.981
LIAM: Oh, my friend's still next to him. Oh, then,
then, excuse me, I would like to throw two

01:01:44.981 --> 01:01:46.137
daggers.

01:01:46.137 --> 01:01:47.686
MATT: Well, the shove was your action.

01:01:47.686 --> 01:01:50.730
LIAM: Right, and I did the boots, so I have
action-action-bonus action.

01:01:50.730 --> 01:01:54.864
MATT: Okay, hold on. Let me see if it's-- You
don't have two actions, you have two attacks. Let

01:01:54.864 --> 01:02:02.091
me check and see if it is. There is a distinction
there.

01:02:02.164 --> 01:02:05.178
LIAM: Every millimeter counts tonight.

01:02:05.178 --> 01:02:09.045
MATT: Yeah, this attack replaces one of them, if
you have multiple attacks, with the attack action,

01:02:09.045 --> 01:02:13.594
which you don't. So you have your offhand bonus
and the haste one, so you do have--

01:02:13.594 --> 01:02:24.306
LIAM: Two attacks right now. Okay. So first one is
an 18 to hit Kevdak, second one is a 25 to hit

01:02:24.306 --> 01:02:25.256
Kevdak.

01:02:25.256 --> 01:02:26.376
MATT: Both hit.

01:02:26.376 --> 01:02:33.047
LIAM: Both hit. Okay. So the first one,
(counting).

01:02:33.047 --> 01:02:35.457
MARISHA: That rogue damage. That rogue damage!

01:02:35.457 --> 01:02:46.672
LIAM: I'm missing a big pile of dice! Eight, 12,
13, 19, 22, 28, 30, 36.

01:02:46.672 --> 01:02:54.082
MATT: 36, half that to-- I know, that brings it to
36, 18.

01:02:54.082 --> 01:02:56.066
LIAM: Is it? It's not a crit, right?

01:02:56.066 --> 01:02:57.669
MATT: No, but it's half-damage for him.

01:02:57.669 --> 01:03:02.894
LIAM: Right, I have to be right up against him to
get a crit, and the second dagger does eight

01:03:02.894 --> 01:03:04.107
halved to four.

01:03:04.107 --> 01:03:08.337
MATT: Okay, four damage, gotcha. Total 22 points
of damage on him. As he's taking all these hits.

01:03:08.337 --> 01:03:09.678
All right.

01:03:09.678 --> 01:03:11.097
LIAM: And I have a little bit of movement, right?

01:03:11.097 --> 01:03:12.995
MATT: You do have a little bit of movement,
because you--

01:03:12.995 --> 01:03:18.383
LIAM: I'll go fwoosh, right up against the flat
side, right below Keyleth, pressed against the

01:03:18.383 --> 01:03:19.361
wall there.

01:03:19.361 --> 01:03:20.287
MATT: All right.

01:03:20.287 --> 01:03:21.651
LAURA: Looking up her windskirts?

01:03:21.651 --> 01:03:23.459
LIAM: No. Not that.

01:03:23.459 --> 01:03:27.072
MARISHA: I've got a Marilyn Monroe thing going on
in my air elemental, oh.

01:03:27.072 --> 01:03:29.538
MATT: There we go. So you're now hidden up against
that roof right below there, and your stealth

01:03:29.538 --> 01:03:31.179
check was 25 earlier, so we'll go with that.

01:03:31.179 --> 01:03:34.292
LIAM: All right, maybe, maybe a quick look. Maybe
a quick look.

01:03:34.292 --> 01:03:41.634
MATT: Move the board a little bit for the people
that are watching so they can get a better view

01:03:41.634 --> 01:03:49.642
here. There we go. So you're over here. Right
here, Liam. All right. So! That brings us to--

01:03:49.642 --> 01:03:52.635
LIAM: Oh, shit! Never mind.

01:03:52.635 --> 01:03:53.700
SAM: Six more attacks!

01:03:53.700 --> 01:03:55.048
MATT: No, you're done, your turn's over.

01:03:55.048 --> 01:03:56.720
LIAM: Never mind, I didn't say it, I didn't say it
so it doesn't matter.

01:03:56.720 --> 01:04:08.836
MATT: Yeah. All right, so. This archer here is
going to turn, looking over at the-- let's see.

01:04:08.836 --> 01:04:16.848
He's currently handled, he's okay right there.
This archer saw you firing. Over in that hide,

01:04:16.848 --> 01:04:17.990
he's going to turn to you.

01:04:17.990 --> 01:04:21.950
TALIESIN: I'm looking at him right now, actually,
I've got my gun in my left hand and I'm looking at him.

01:04:21.950 --> 01:04:24.756
MATT: Archer's going to take two shots, pulling on
his longbow, (arrow sounds).

01:04:24.756 --> 01:04:26.532
Two arrows at you, Percy.

01:04:26.532 --> 01:04:28.542
TALIESIN: I smile the whole time. Bring it.

01:04:28.542 --> 01:04:31.506
LIAM: Staring at him with that dead-in-the-eyes
Percy look? Yeah.

01:04:31.506 --> 01:04:33.741
TALIESIN: Do not fuck with Reed Richards. He will
fuck you up.

01:04:33.741 --> 01:04:36.843
MATT: That is a 20 to hit on the first one.

01:04:36.843 --> 01:04:38.474
TALIESIN: That hits.

01:04:38.474 --> 01:04:39.968
MATT: And a 25 on the second.

01:04:39.968 --> 01:04:41.930
TALIESIN: That, that also hits.

01:04:41.930 --> 01:04:46.939
SAM: Everybody's rolling high tonight. Except us.

01:04:46.939 --> 01:04:52.890
MATT: First one is 11 points of piercing damage to
you.

01:04:52.890 --> 01:04:55.325
TALIESIN: 11 for the first one?

01:04:55.325 --> 01:04:56.174
MATT: Yep.

01:04:56.174 --> 01:04:57.383
TALIESIN: I take it in the shoulder.

01:04:57.383 --> 01:05:02.265
MATT: All right. The second one is going to go
ahead and do 13 points of piercing damage.

01:05:02.265 --> 01:05:03.671
TALIESIN: That one I'm going to catch.

01:05:03.671 --> 01:05:06.115
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and roll for it.

01:05:06.115 --> 01:05:08.868
SAM: Gloves of Missile Snaring!

01:05:08.868 --> 01:05:15.206
TALIESIN: That's 14, so not only does it do no
damage, I actually take it and catch.

01:05:15.286 --> 01:05:17.206
MATT: You catch the arrow in front of your face.

01:05:17.206 --> 01:05:18.359
TALIESIN: Snap it.

01:05:18.359 --> 01:05:21.232
MATT: (laughs) That's amazing.

01:05:21.232 --> 01:05:23.558
TALIESIN: And the gun is going to turn to look at
him.

01:05:23.558 --> 01:05:24.486
MATT: Okay.

01:05:24.486 --> 01:05:25.362
TALIESIN: Thank you.

01:05:25.362 --> 01:05:26.582
LAURA: Nice, Percy.

01:05:26.582 --> 01:05:31.641
MATT: You can see from the distance the visage of
this half-orc looks back as you do that and goes--

01:05:31.641 --> 01:05:44.248
And goes to shakily-- hand reaching back for
another arrow. This archer's going to go ahead and

01:05:44.248 --> 01:05:48.871
leap down onto here. Oh, you do get an attack of
opportunity on him.

01:05:48.871 --> 01:05:51.236
LAURA: He knocks down a tree in the process.

01:05:51.236 --> 01:05:55.958
MARISHA: What a dick! That's a natural 18, so
that's a 26.

01:05:55.958 --> 01:05:59.678
MATT: Pretty sure that hits. Also rolled a natural
19 on the acrobatics check, so lands fine, but you

01:05:59.678 --> 01:06:02.561
do manage to do one attack worth of damage to him
as he jumps down.

01:06:02.561 --> 01:06:07.386
LIAM: Airsoft shot to the nuts.

01:06:07.386 --> 01:06:08.812
MARISHA: I rolled double ones.

01:06:08.812 --> 01:06:10.518
LAURA: Pathetic!

01:06:10.518 --> 01:06:12.156
MARISHA: Plus five, so seven.

01:06:12.156 --> 01:06:14.215
LAURA: That's not bad, that's not bad.

01:06:14.215 --> 01:06:15.578
MARISHA: Little damage.

01:06:15.578 --> 01:06:17.601
LIAM: Something to remember you by.

01:06:17.601 --> 01:06:19.072
ASHLEY: Maybe he only has like ten hit points.

01:06:19.072 --> 01:06:24.036
MATT: Cool, so your elemental form swings wide,
manages to slam the bottom of them as they leap

01:06:24.036 --> 01:06:27.852
down, sending them into a spin, but they do manage
to catch themself because they're quite acrobatic.

01:06:27.852 --> 01:06:33.115
In doing so, they step up to the very edge here to
their friend, who is currently on the ground, who

01:06:33.115 --> 01:06:38.202
is also going to get up there, and they're both
going to look at each other, pull their arrows

01:06:38.202 --> 01:06:46.168
out, and they're going to go ahead and make a
series of strikes. Let's see. This one here is

01:06:46.168 --> 01:06:51.053
going to go ahead and is going to shoot at Pike,
because Pike's on the ground. And this one's going

01:06:51.053 --> 01:06:57.263
to go ahead and strike at Grog, because it can't
see Percy over there through the tree. So Grog--

01:06:57.263 --> 01:07:04.083
LAURA: Natural one, natural one.

01:07:04.083 --> 01:07:05.961
MATT: That is a 19.

01:07:05.961 --> 01:07:07.326
TRAVIS: Misses.

01:07:07.326 --> 01:07:12.176
MATT: Misses you? (arrow sound) One arrow hits the
bit of your shoulder armor right here and shatters

01:07:12.176 --> 01:07:15.719
off the bone. The second one, however, is a 26.

01:07:15.719 --> 01:07:16.900
TRAVIS: Yes, that hits.

01:07:16.900 --> 01:07:23.264
MATT: All right, so. From that one, you take, I
don't like that, cocked. Nine points of piercing

01:07:23.264 --> 01:07:29.765
damage. Reduced to four. The one that's taking two
strikes at you, Pike, because you're on the

01:07:29.765 --> 01:07:30.810
ground, now.

01:07:30.810 --> 01:07:33.768
ASHLEY: It's also probably very hard for him to
shoot through the people that are attacking me.

01:07:33.768 --> 01:07:37.618
MATT: There is one individual attacking you that
is on the other side of your body, so you're

01:07:37.618 --> 01:07:39.179
pretty visible from that point in time.

01:07:39.179 --> 01:07:40.916
ASHLEY: Okay.

01:07:40.916 --> 01:07:43.665
LAURA: She's really little.

01:07:43.665 --> 01:07:50.946
MATT: However, the attack, because you are prone,
it has disadvantage on the attack rolls with you

01:07:50.946 --> 01:07:56.819
because it's not within five feet of you. But it's
going to go ahead and attempt to make it. Two 17s

01:07:56.819 --> 01:08:02.713
in a row. Plus ten, that's-- sorry, not plus ten,
plus eight on the archers, yeah, plus eight. So

01:08:02.713 --> 01:08:03.993
that's 25?

01:08:03.993 --> 01:08:04.894
ASHLEY: Yeah.

01:08:04.894 --> 01:08:11.812
MATT: And natural one on the other disadvantage,
so that misses. You take 13 points of piercing

01:08:11.812 --> 01:08:16.616
damage from one of the arrows, (arrow sound). So
it's going to do there. They finish their turns.

01:08:16.616 --> 01:08:23.313
This one is going to, being pushed, shoved off,
come around here.

01:08:23.313 --> 01:08:26.517
MARISHA: What? Who's that?

01:08:26.517 --> 01:08:28.235
LAURA: Oh, that's the one you pushed off the
roof.

01:08:28.235 --> 01:08:35.531
MATT: Is going to come over this way and hide to
the side. Just going to watch what's happening.

01:08:35.531 --> 01:08:41.861
That finishes the archers' turn. Kevdak. (grunts)
Unable to do anything, is going to attempt to make

01:08:41.861 --> 01:08:48.739
a saving throw. And that is going to be a total of
18. What's your DC?

01:08:48.739 --> 01:08:49.853
SAM: 20.

01:08:49.853 --> 01:08:51.400
(yelling)

01:08:51.400 --> 01:08:57.555
TRAVIS: Oh, Scanlan! I will make out with that
fucking shirt, I swear to god!

01:08:57.555 --> 01:09:08.206
SAM: I mean, my spell DC's 18, but with the Hand
Cone of Clarity, okay.

01:09:08.206 --> 01:09:11.526
TALIESIN: Don't talk him out of it.

01:09:11.526 --> 01:09:12.790
SAM: Just making sure.

01:09:12.790 --> 01:09:18.738
MATT: Oh man. All right, well, that ends Kevdak's
turn. Scanlan, you're up.

01:09:18.738 --> 01:09:27.647
SAM: Okay. I, while maintaining concentration I
can still use the wand to do things, yeah? So I'll

01:09:27.647 --> 01:09:30.715
use three charges of the Wand of Fireballs.

01:09:30.715 --> 01:09:32.162
MATT: What're you doing now?

01:09:32.162 --> 01:09:36.328
SAM: I'm aiming a Fireball right around there.

01:09:36.328 --> 01:09:37.867
MATT: So moving up to here.

01:09:37.867 --> 01:09:44.083
SAM: Oh yes, I guess I have to move forward to
attack. Can I get a radius that includes Kevdak

01:09:44.083 --> 01:09:45.478
and these guys over here?

01:09:45.478 --> 01:09:46.898
MATT: Yeah, you can do that.

01:09:46.898 --> 01:09:50.938
SAM: But not Pike. And hopefully not Grog if my
aim is true.

01:09:50.938 --> 01:09:54.185
MATT: Yeah, if you get it there you can manage to
hit all of them but Grog right there.

01:09:54.185 --> 01:09:55.157
SAM: Okay.

01:09:55.157 --> 01:09:56.412
ASHLEY: Go Scanlan!

01:09:56.412 --> 01:09:58.626
MATT: One, two, three, four, five, six.

01:09:58.626 --> 01:10:01.375
SAM: Okay. Three charges is 10d6.

01:10:01.375 --> 01:10:06.128
MATT: All right, so go ahead and roll that. Kevdak
automatically fails, because he's paralyzed.

01:10:06.128 --> 01:10:10.840
LIAM: Yeah. MVP.

01:10:10.840 --> 01:10:12.668
MATT: So does Greenbeard.

01:10:12.668 --> 01:10:16.827
SAM: 34.

01:10:16.827 --> 01:10:26.421
MATT: All right, so. 34, reduced to half because
he's raging. That brings it to six, no, 17. All

01:10:26.421 --> 01:10:38.831
right, and then Greenbeard takes 34. The other
ones there, they do not get advantages because

01:10:38.831 --> 01:10:46.399
they're all just fighters, that's a failure,
failure, what was the spell DC on the wand?

01:10:46.399 --> 01:10:48.467
Because it's different from yours.

01:10:48.467 --> 01:10:51.972
SAM: DC's 15, I wrote it down. DC 15.

01:10:51.972 --> 01:11:03.282
MATT: Okay, so that's a success. Success. So two
of them over there take-- all right.

01:11:03.282 --> 01:11:08.479
TALIESIN: It'll be fine, it'll be fine, things are
working.

01:11:08.479 --> 01:11:15.172
MATT: All righty. Great, so (explosion). Giant
burst of flame hits, it actually sets fire to this

01:11:15.172 --> 01:11:20.556
entire structure. The wooden barricade is in
flames, we'll say for the purposes of considering that.

01:11:20.556 --> 01:11:22.606
SAM: There's flaming spikes on the field!

01:11:22.606 --> 01:11:25.213
MARISHA: Flaming spikes!

01:11:25.213 --> 01:11:31.477
MATT: All right, so. There we go. There is
currently--

01:11:31.477 --> 01:11:35.168
TALIESIN: I was really hoping you were going to
come up with a-- oh wow, that's actually-- never

01:11:35.168 --> 01:11:37.177
mind, I am not disappointed at all.

01:11:37.177 --> 01:11:39.364
MATT: So those are on fire.

01:11:39.364 --> 01:11:44.065
MARISHA: Hah, 'I thought you were going to come
out with a f-- that, that, yeah, that works, that.'

01:11:44.065 --> 01:11:46.132
MATT: All right. So.

01:11:46.132 --> 01:11:50.296
SAM: I'm going to try to do the Pike move and jump
down one level.

01:11:50.296 --> 01:11:52.186
MATT: Down there? All right, make an acrobatics
check.

01:11:52.186 --> 01:11:56.390
SAM: Oh, Jesus. Okay, okay. 14-- 19!

01:11:56.390 --> 01:12:00.646
MATT: 19. You leap down and make it right there.

01:12:00.646 --> 01:12:07.838
SAM: Okay. And I will, with the bonus, I will heal
Grog with a Healing Word.

01:12:07.838 --> 01:12:09.204
MATT: Healing Word, okay.

01:12:09.204 --> 01:12:16.138
What's the range on it?

01:12:16.138 --> 01:12:20.194
SAM: Oh. 60 feet for Healing Word, I believe.
Right?

01:12:20.194 --> 01:12:22.114
MATT: He's just out of your range.

01:12:22.114 --> 01:12:24.557
SAM: Okay, well then I will heal Pike, is that
okay?

01:12:24.557 --> 01:12:26.535
MATT: You can do that, you can shout over the
side. You have to get into view of her, which

01:12:26.535 --> 01:12:28.276
means you have to move a little bit closer to the
edge, but yeah.

01:12:28.276 --> 01:12:29.676
SAM: Okay, I'll do that.

01:12:29.676 --> 01:12:34.510
MATT: Okay, so you get about there, glance off the
side. All right. Go for it.

01:12:34.510 --> 01:12:41.876
SAM: I'll peek over the side and say, (singing)
Never going to fuck you up, never going to let you

01:12:41.876 --> 01:12:46.803
down, never going to run around and not heal you.

01:12:46.803 --> 01:12:48.415
(laughter)

01:12:48.415 --> 01:12:53.894
MATT: All right, so go ahead and roll your heal
for Pike. Grog, you're up next.

01:12:53.894 --> 01:12:55.453
SAM: Yeah, seven points!

01:12:55.453 --> 01:12:56.956
ASHLEY: Oh, I'll take it.

01:12:56.956 --> 01:12:59.957
MATT: Hey, it all helps. All right. And with that,
Grog, you're up.

01:12:59.957 --> 01:13:04.126
LAURA: Oh my god. (singing) Natural crit.

01:13:04.126 --> 01:13:12.941
TRAVIS: So in my frenzied reckless attacking,
great weapon master, can I bring my axe up high

01:13:12.941 --> 01:13:17.336
and swing it for the first attack to his left side
where dangly hand is?

01:13:17.336 --> 01:13:23.319
MATT: You can, go for it. Your regular straight
attack. You have advantage, and then it's

01:13:23.319 --> 01:13:26.784
disadvantage for that, so that brings it to a
regular attack. Minus five.

01:13:26.784 --> 01:13:28.103
TRAVIS: Disadvantage for the?

01:13:28.103 --> 01:13:29.582
MATT: Because of the called shot.

01:13:29.582 --> 01:13:30.623
TRAVIS: Okay.

01:13:30.623 --> 01:13:34.515
MARISHA: But then advantage because it's
reckless?

01:13:34.515 --> 01:13:39.377
TRAVIS: 23.

01:13:39.377 --> 01:13:42.753
MATT: 23? Hits. With the minus five?

01:13:42.753 --> 01:13:45.109
TRAVIS: No. 18.

01:13:45.109 --> 01:13:46.261
MATT: Still hits.

01:13:46.261 --> 01:13:47.809
(cheering)

01:13:47.809 --> 01:13:49.227
TALIESIN: You asshole.

01:13:49.227 --> 01:13:52.527
MATT: So it's a d12.

01:13:52.527 --> 01:13:58.434
TRAVIS: (counting) 20 for the first one. 30, with
great weapon master.

01:13:58.434 --> 01:14:02.110
LAURA: But you double your dice because it's a
natural crit, because he's five feet away.

01:14:02.110 --> 01:14:03.704
MATT: Because he's paralyzed and five feet away.

01:14:03.704 --> 01:14:05.204
TRAVIS: 60.

01:14:05.204 --> 01:14:06.793
LAURA: No, just your dice, double your dice.

01:14:06.793 --> 01:14:11.692
MATT: This is with your axe, right? So with the axe,
it's a d12 plus your raging bonus,

01:14:11.692 --> 01:14:13.036
plus your strength.

01:14:13.036 --> 01:14:15.109
TRAVIS: 11. Which is seven. Or eight. Rage bonus
is eight.

01:14:15.109 --> 01:14:18.760
MATT: Well, the rage bonus should be plus-- the
total becomes plus--

01:14:18.760 --> 01:14:21.166
TRAVIS: Oh sorry, the total bonus is eight.

01:14:21.166 --> 01:14:24.618
MATT: Three plus-- four, isn't it, right now? So
it should be seven.

01:14:24.618 --> 01:14:28.270
TRAVIS: That's why that's a seven. That's it.
Right.

01:14:28.270 --> 01:14:30.540
MATT: Yeah. You're not using your warhammer.
You're not attuned to this weapon.

01:14:30.540 --> 01:14:32.205
TRAVIS: Right, okay, so whatever.

01:14:32.205 --> 01:14:33.252
MATT: So what'd you roll on the dice?

01:14:33.252 --> 01:14:34.298
TRAVIS: 11.

01:14:34.298 --> 01:14:39.804
MATT: 11. Technically it's a critical hit. So, I
mean, it's a critical hit, so you do your brutal

01:14:39.804 --> 01:14:48.936
critical. You roll two more d12s. So it was an 11
times two, that's 22, plus seven, that's 29,

01:14:48.936 --> 01:14:50.109
plus 2d12.

01:14:50.109 --> 01:14:53.887
TRAVIS: Five, so that's 34.

01:14:53.887 --> 01:14:55.139
MATT: 34.

01:14:55.139 --> 01:14:59.256
TRAVIS: And a nine, so that's 43.

01:14:59.256 --> 01:15:02.023
MATT: 43 reduced to half, that's 21 points of
slashing damage.

01:15:02.023 --> 01:15:05.082
TRAVIS: And that's the first one, called shot.

01:15:05.082 --> 01:15:11.031
MATT: With that, thunk, the blade finds its way
into his side, as you hear cracking on the rock

01:15:11.031 --> 01:15:18.426
below him, the sound of the left gauntlet,
(cracking) hitting the bottom of the square. The

01:15:18.426 --> 01:15:22.487
fingers twitch in the gauntlet as he's currently
standing there with his left arm bisected from the

01:15:22.487 --> 01:15:23.979
rest of his body.

01:15:23.979 --> 01:15:25.750
LAURA: Does he shrink?

01:15:25.750 --> 01:15:27.561
MATT: No.

01:15:27.561 --> 01:15:29.185
LAURA: Dammit.

01:15:29.185 --> 01:15:31.482
TRAVIS: Second attack, straight across his back.

01:15:31.482 --> 01:15:32.802
MATT: Okay, straight into his back?

01:15:32.802 --> 01:15:38.742
SAM: Does another smaller doll hand come out to
replace it?

01:15:38.742 --> 01:15:41.384
LAURA: Teeny tiny.

01:15:41.384 --> 01:15:44.942
TRAVIS: That is a 22.

01:15:44.942 --> 01:15:46.336
MATT: 22 hits.

01:15:46.336 --> 01:15:57.582
TRAVIS: Yeah, 22. Okay. And that's four, so double
this-- 12, right? So four times two is eight. Plus

01:15:57.582 --> 01:16:10.324
four is 11. Math is a bitch. And two more of them?
Because it's a critical? Okay. Seven. And a nine.

01:16:10.324 --> 01:16:13.249
MATT: 28, half that is 14.

01:16:13.249 --> 01:16:16.414
LAURA: Math! Math is fun!

01:16:16.414 --> 01:16:21.298
MATT: So you're hacking into him, you see the
wounds are opened and his body is shaking from the

01:16:21.298 --> 01:16:26.520
amount of pain that's wracking him at this time.
He's still holding up against a lot of damage

01:16:26.520 --> 01:16:29.074
that's come to him, but he's starting to look a
little rough.

01:16:29.074 --> 01:16:36.521
TRAVIS: So I have my third frenzied attack for a
bonus action, right? With my bonus action I have

01:16:36.521 --> 01:16:40.439
one superior healing potion. Can I take that?

01:16:40.439 --> 01:16:54.031
MATT: You can, yeah. That will heal you, a
superior, let's see. Superior is 8d4 plus eight.

01:16:54.031 --> 01:16:55.469
TRAVIS: 8d4 plus eight?

01:16:55.469 --> 01:16:58.058
MATT: Your superior, that's the expensive one you
guys got.

01:16:58.058 --> 01:17:01.460
LIAM: 8d4, four-sided, the four-sided. Pyramids.

01:17:01.460 --> 01:17:19.696
TRAVIS: Fuck me, asshole. Fuck. Fuck me asshole!
Seven. Nine. Ele-- 12. 14. 16. 19. 20. 20.

01:17:19.696 --> 01:17:23.331
MATT: All right, so you heal 20. All right, that
ends your turn, Grog. All righty. Unless you want

01:17:23.331 --> 01:17:24.384
to move.

01:17:24.384 --> 01:17:26.490
TRAVIS: Can I, can I-- huh?

01:17:26.490 --> 01:17:28.143
LAURA: You could pick it up.

01:17:28.143 --> 01:17:29.978
TRAVIS: I can't pick it up, I can only move.

01:17:29.978 --> 01:17:34.288
MATT: I mean, you have, you wouldn't be able to
wield your axe.

01:17:34.288 --> 01:17:37.809
LAURA: But can you put it in the Bag of Holding?

01:17:37.809 --> 01:17:39.524
MATT: Next turn, if you want to try it.

01:17:39.524 --> 01:17:45.021
TRAVIS: No, I'm going to, can I move, if I stay in
his flank, if I move away from the three guys that

01:17:45.021 --> 01:17:46.126
are surrounding me, they're--

01:17:46.126 --> 01:17:47.674
MATT: They're all going to get an attack on you.

01:17:47.674 --> 01:17:48.971
TRAVIS: I'll stay.

01:17:48.971 --> 01:17:51.412
MATT: All right. All right, so that finishes your
turn, Grog.

01:17:51.412 --> 01:17:52.408
TRAVIS: Yes, thank you.

01:17:52.408 --> 01:17:58.724
MATT: Next up is Greenbeard, who is currently
frozen in place, however, rolls an 18 plus five,

01:17:58.724 --> 01:18:04.950
as far as, his wisdom is plus ten, so that puts
him at 28. So he resists the Hold Person and is

01:18:04.950 --> 01:18:09.389
currently no longer affected by that. All right,
that finishes his turn, though, because that's the

01:18:09.389 --> 01:18:10.960
end of his turn. Percy, you're up.

01:18:10.960 --> 01:18:17.567
TALIESIN: All right. This is going to be fun. That
asshole who just shot me, I'm now aiming at him.

01:18:17.567 --> 01:18:28.231
And I'm going to push him off the roof, this'll be
fun. So, pushing him off the roof, am I going to

01:18:28.231 --> 01:18:30.610
do extra damage to him, or am I?

01:18:30.610 --> 01:18:33.073
LIAM: If he hits. If he hits the ground.

01:18:33.073 --> 01:18:36.361
TALIESIN: Well, I mean, I'm debating whether or
not to sharpshooter it to do-- no, I think I'll

01:18:36.361 --> 01:18:39.059
just push him off the roof. It's funnier.

01:18:39.059 --> 01:18:40.855
TRAVIS: I can feel my heartbeat in my face.

01:18:40.855 --> 01:18:45.450
LAURA: I know, I can't tell if it's actually
really warm in here or if we're all just really hot.

01:18:45.450 --> 01:18:48.374
MATT: Probably a little bit of column A, a little
bit of column B. What was it?

01:18:48.374 --> 01:18:49.469
TALIESIN: 28 to hit.

01:18:49.469 --> 01:18:51.380
MATT: 28 hits. Non-sharpshooter?

01:18:51.380 --> 01:18:52.470
TALIESIN: Non-sharpshooter.

01:18:52.470 --> 01:18:53.692
SAM: Dullshooter.

01:18:53.692 --> 01:18:59.952
TALIESIN: But I'm doing a torso shot. So he gets
no save, there's no save for the torso shot, he's

01:18:59.952 --> 01:19:03.136
going to take his damage and move ten feet away
from me.

01:19:03.136 --> 01:19:04.177
MATT: Okay.

01:19:04.177 --> 01:19:09.921
TALIESIN: So. That's 14 points of damage, of
piercing damage.

01:19:09.921 --> 01:19:13.582
MATT: 14 points of piercing damage and he gets
shoved off the back of the roof, he's going to

01:19:13.582 --> 01:19:19.322
make an acrobatics check, which he succeeds, so he
lands down there and he only takes one point of

01:19:19.322 --> 01:19:21.716
damage from the fall, but. There you go.

01:19:21.716 --> 01:19:30.999
TALIESIN: Fine. I'm going to reload, and now, what
am I going to do? Let's see.

01:19:30.999 --> 01:19:34.370
SAM: Jump down the chimney, deliver presents.

01:19:34.370 --> 01:19:36.933
TALIESIN: Surveying the field, trying to make some
decisions.

01:19:36.933 --> 01:19:38.520
SAM: Help Pike!

01:19:38.520 --> 01:19:40.006
TALIESIN: I can't. Well!

01:19:40.006 --> 01:19:41.814
MARISHA: Can you hit Greenbeard?

01:19:41.814 --> 01:19:45.916
TALIESIN: I can hit Greenbeard, I'm going to hit
Greenbeard. He's got the magicky creepy thing, right?

01:19:45.916 --> 01:19:49.465
LAURA: Yeah, he's gross. He's got mold on his
neck.

01:19:49.465 --> 01:19:51.944
MATT: Fungal moss on his whole neck and chest
area.

01:19:51.944 --> 01:19:59.372
TALIESIN: All right. Well, we'll see how things
go. Let's do a sharpshooter shot at him right now.

01:19:59.372 --> 01:20:06.165
Let's see what a little bit of damage does to him.
So sharpshooter with Retort. Don't miss. And my

01:20:06.165 --> 01:20:08.512
pistol goes (breaking sound).

01:20:08.512 --> 01:20:10.256
(groaning)

01:20:10.256 --> 01:20:11.640
MATT: All right.

01:20:11.640 --> 01:20:13.597
TALIESIN: And I'm putting it away, so.

01:20:13.597 --> 01:20:16.870
MATT: Okay, all right, so that's going to end your
turn? Keyleth, you're up.

01:20:16.870 --> 01:20:22.325
MARISHA: All right. Tornado's coming down the
house. I'm going to hit these two guys with a

01:20:22.325 --> 01:20:23.688
Whirlwind again.

01:20:23.688 --> 01:20:24.877
MATT: Right here?

01:20:24.877 --> 01:20:27.926
MARISHA: Yep. 13 strength save.

01:20:27.926 --> 01:20:37.826
MATT: 13 strength saves on both of them. Archers--
all right. That's a natural 19 plus two, and two

01:20:37.826 --> 01:20:40.006
natural 19s in a row. Yeah, they both make their
saves.

01:20:40.006 --> 01:20:58.057
MARISHA: So nine plus-- oh, one more d8. Plus
another five, so that was 12 plus five is 17,

01:20:58.057 --> 01:20:59.959
plus another two, so 19 halved.

01:20:59.959 --> 01:21:05.533
MATT: 19 halved? All right, so that puts them at
nine points of bludgeoning damage each. Not really

01:21:05.533 --> 01:21:08.843
having much of an effect at this point in the
fight, however, as you swirl around, picking up

01:21:08.843 --> 01:21:12.440
the debris from the roof as you can, it slams into
them and they brace against it, but they still,

01:21:12.440 --> 01:21:16.727
glancing over their shoulder, realize that they've
got to continue what they're doing now. The bigger

01:21:16.727 --> 01:21:18.786
threat appears to be out in front of them.

01:21:18.786 --> 01:21:20.963
MARISHA: I'm staying in their space, by the way.

01:21:20.963 --> 01:21:24.944
MATT: Right, right, so you're up in there. Up in
their shit.

01:21:24.944 --> 01:21:28.659
LAURA: Up in their business? Oh, it fell anyway!
It happened.

01:21:28.659 --> 01:21:34.870
MATT: There you go. No. All righty. Finished your
turn? All right. Pike, you're up.

01:21:34.870 --> 01:21:37.281
ASHLEY: All right. I'm going to put on my
Sprinter's Boots.

01:21:37.281 --> 01:21:39.662
MATT: They're on you, right?

01:21:39.662 --> 01:21:40.820
ASHLEY: What's that?

01:21:40.820 --> 01:21:44.766
MATT: So you're getting up, that's half your
movement to stand up, all right.

01:21:44.766 --> 01:21:50.866
ASHLEY: Yeah. Okay. And I'm going to run around
towards the back of the house.

01:21:50.866 --> 01:21:52.359
MATT: This way?

01:21:52.359 --> 01:21:54.163
SAM: Door.

01:21:54.163 --> 01:22:04.352
MATT: What're you doing? Ashley, what're you
doing? So your Sprinter's Boots activate, which

01:22:04.352 --> 01:22:10.193
gives you double movement. Right? So you can move
50 feet. But you moved up, it took you 25 to stand

01:22:10.193 --> 01:22:14.361
up because it's half your speed to get up from
prone, so you still have 25 feet you can move.

01:22:14.361 --> 01:22:16.413
ASHLEY: Okay, so I'm going to go around to the
side.

01:22:16.413 --> 01:22:22.815
MATT: This side? All right, so you move. Here?
Right?

01:22:22.815 --> 01:22:24.186
ASHLEY: Yeah, as far as it'll--

01:22:24.186 --> 01:22:28.177
MATT: Okay, so you rush over there. That one guy
takes a swing at you as you rush by, gah!, or girl

01:22:28.177 --> 01:22:36.381
I should say, the female half-elf swings with the
giant blade. That's going to be a 23?

01:22:36.381 --> 01:22:38.056
ASHLEY: Fuck. Yeah.

01:22:38.056 --> 01:22:46.651
MATT: Okay. As the blade smacks you from behind as
you rush past, you suffer 14 points of slashing

01:22:46.651 --> 01:22:52.514
damage. In your back. But you keep running around
the edge. All right, what are you doing?

01:22:52.514 --> 01:22:55.192
ASHLEY: All right, I'm going to heal myself.

01:22:55.192 --> 01:22:56.510
MATT: All righty.

01:22:56.510 --> 01:23:08.371
ASHLEY: A little, doing a little rough here. I'm
going to cast Cure Wounds on myself. At third level.

01:23:08.371 --> 01:23:22.357
SAM: Isn't this exciting?

01:23:22.357 --> 01:23:23.958
LIAM: Yes it is!

01:23:23.958 --> 01:23:25.127
MARISHA: Good times, guys.

01:23:25.127 --> 01:23:26.691
SAM: We're fighting a horde of goliaths!

01:23:26.691 --> 01:23:28.186
MATT: What you got, Ashley?

01:23:28.186 --> 01:23:29.688
ASHLEY: What's that?

01:23:29.688 --> 01:23:30.739
MATT: What you got, what you doing?

01:23:30.739 --> 01:23:31.854
ASHLEY: Oh, I cast Cure Wounds on myself.

01:23:31.854 --> 01:23:33.501
MATT: And you're done? You're healed up? Okay,
that's the end of your turn.

01:23:33.501 --> 01:23:34.793
ASHLEY: I can't do any, don't I have a bonus
action?

01:23:34.793 --> 01:23:36.058
MATT: You have a bonus action still if you want.

01:23:36.058 --> 01:23:37.372
LAURA: You got your spiritual weapon still.

01:23:37.372 --> 01:23:42.790
ASHLEY: Okay, I'm going to use my spiritual weapon
on him again, on Kevdak.

01:23:42.790 --> 01:23:45.777
MATT: Okay, so go ahead and swing for the attack
on that one.

01:23:45.777 --> 01:23:54.972
ASHLEY: Okay, and I'm going to use Guided Strike?

01:23:54.972 --> 01:24:01.095
MATT: Well, I mean, yeah, you have advantage. You
have advantage on the attack, by the way, he's

01:24:01.095 --> 01:24:03.622
paralyzed. He's still paralyzed.

01:24:03.622 --> 01:24:06.971
LAURA: Oh, that's good!

01:24:06.971 --> 01:24:08.331
ASHLEY: It's still under it.

01:24:08.331 --> 01:24:10.607
LAURA: Don't you add anything to it?

01:24:10.607 --> 01:24:11.870
MATT: Add your spell attack.

01:24:11.870 --> 01:24:15.353
ASHLEY: Oh, yeah, well then I'm great. Fuck, I'm
forgetting everything, I'm so nervous!

01:24:15.353 --> 01:24:17.346
MATT: It's okay, you've been away for a while.

01:24:17.346 --> 01:24:20.158
ASHLEY: Okay. Yeah, we're good to go. 22.

01:24:20.158 --> 01:24:25.283
MATT: 22? That hits. So go ahead and roll your
3d8, I think it is, no, 4d8.

01:24:25.283 --> 01:24:26.737
LAURA: 4d8.

01:24:26.737 --> 01:24:32.043
MATT: Plus your wisdom modifier, which is plus--
what's your wisdom modifier?

01:24:32.043 --> 01:24:36.579
SAM: She's doing math, give her a second.

01:24:36.579 --> 01:24:42.060
TALIESIN: Dice are doubled, too? The weapon's
within five feet.

01:24:42.060 --> 01:24:42.891
MATT: Yeah.

01:24:42.891 --> 01:24:44.074
TALIESIN: Thank you.

01:24:44.074 --> 01:24:47.879
SAM: (nerdy voice) Oh, the weapon's within five
feet.

01:24:47.879 --> 01:24:49.201
LAURA: Do you add the spell attack bonus to it?

01:24:49.201 --> 01:24:50.519
TALIESIN: Suck it, nerd. Dear god.

01:24:50.519 --> 01:24:52.921
MATT: No, it's not attack, it's your wisdom
modifier, but what's the dice, the dice are

01:24:52.921 --> 01:24:54.155
doubled because it's a critical hit.

01:24:54.155 --> 01:24:55.165
TRAVIS: 18.

01:24:55.165 --> 01:24:56.119
LAURA: Times two.

01:24:56.119 --> 01:24:59.956
MATT: 36, half that to 18. Then add your wisdom
modifier.

01:24:59.956 --> 01:25:03.190
LAURA: Plus four!

01:25:03.190 --> 01:25:10.511
MATT: Plus four. All right, so. Half of that would
be two, so 20. 20 points of damage to him from the

01:25:10.511 --> 01:25:14.919
strike of that. All righty, that finishes your
turn.

01:25:14.919 --> 01:25:17.435
TRAVIS: Does your piece of paper back there look
like Stephen Hawking's chalkboard?

01:25:17.435 --> 01:25:19.103
MATT: Kind of, right now, yeah.

01:25:19.103 --> 01:25:21.341
SAM: Wow.

01:25:21.341 --> 01:25:24.056
LAURA: That's actually way more organized than I
thought it would be.

01:25:24.056 --> 01:25:28.806
TRAVIS: Young Stephen Hawking. You horrible,
horrible person.

01:25:28.806 --> 01:25:37.705
MATT: First, the woman who just swung past you is
going to go ahead and rush around the corner as

01:25:37.705 --> 01:25:44.510
well and follow you, since you got out of the way.
Rush into and go after you, Pike. The three that

01:25:44.510 --> 01:25:49.715
are on you, Grog, are still going to, after
watching you cut one of Kevdak's arms off, roar

01:25:49.715 --> 01:25:56.179
angrily around you, all three of them (roar), and
go into another round of angry, angry strikes

01:25:56.179 --> 01:25:57.357
against you.

01:25:57.357 --> 01:25:58.605
LAURA: Oh god.

01:25:58.605 --> 01:26:02.676
MATT: All right, so that comes to you, Grog, since
you did reckless attack on him for the stuff, they

01:26:02.676 --> 01:26:06.282
all have advantage on you anyway, so all the
attacks are with advantage, that's six attacks.

01:26:06.282 --> 01:26:08.581
MARISHA: Six attacks.

01:26:08.581 --> 01:26:09.932
MATT: That's a natural 20.

01:26:09.932 --> 01:26:11.424
(yelling)

01:26:11.424 --> 01:26:19.080
MATT: 26 on the second. 23 on the third.

01:26:19.080 --> 01:26:20.630
TRAVIS: Hits.

01:26:20.630 --> 01:26:24.680
MATT: 24 on the fourth.

01:26:24.680 --> 01:26:26.784
TALIESIN: Can you roll poorly?

01:26:26.784 --> 01:26:29.587
MATT: 26 on the fifth.

01:26:29.587 --> 01:26:31.110
SAM: Wow.

01:26:31.110 --> 01:26:33.483
LIAM: Welcome to our production of Julius Caesar.

01:26:33.483 --> 01:26:35.246
MATT: No, they all, five hits and one crit.

01:26:35.246 --> 01:26:36.504
LAURA: What?

01:26:36.504 --> 01:26:42.619
MATT: They all hit, yeah. Reckless attack puts you
in a bad position when you're surrounded with guys

01:26:42.619 --> 01:26:44.556
that can do multiple hits that are also
barbarians.

01:26:44.556 --> 01:26:46.185
LIAM: Here it comes.

01:26:46.185 --> 01:26:51.410
MARISHA: Get that barbarian's resistance.

01:26:51.410 --> 01:26:53.356
MATT: We'll do the crit first on you.

01:26:53.356 --> 01:26:54.464
TRAVIS: Okay.

01:26:54.464 --> 01:26:57.488
MATT: You already used the Stone's Resistance. Oh,
the barbarian, yeah. So that'll help.

01:26:57.488 --> 01:26:59.472
TRAVIS: Don't say the word yet.

01:26:59.472 --> 01:27:00.627
MARISHA: Well.

01:27:00.627 --> 01:27:02.479
SAM: Is it that thing where you die?

01:27:02.479 --> 01:27:07.523
MATT: Seven plus eight, 15, reduced to half,
that's seven. So I'll give you the direct amounts

01:27:07.523 --> 01:27:16.394
here. So this is with the reduction. So that's
seven points of slashing damage. Another seven.

01:27:16.394 --> 01:27:17.826
TRAVIS: Okay.

01:27:17.826 --> 01:27:21.596
MATT: Another seven.

01:27:21.596 --> 01:27:22.842
TRAVIS: Okay.

01:27:22.842 --> 01:27:25.771
MATT: Here we go. That's a nine.

01:27:25.771 --> 01:27:26.930
TRAVIS: Okay.

01:27:26.930 --> 01:27:30.068
MATT: Not that great. That's a six.

01:27:30.068 --> 01:27:31.195
TRAVIS: Okay.

01:27:31.195 --> 01:27:32.662
MATT: And then now the crit.

01:27:32.662 --> 01:27:36.044
LAURA: I thought you said the first one was a
crit.

01:27:36.044 --> 01:27:39.867
LIAM: That's what you said.

01:27:39.867 --> 01:27:42.619
MATT: And then I thought differently but I didn't
say it out loud, but because you're calling me on

01:27:42.619 --> 01:27:43.779
it, I'll let it happen.

01:27:43.779 --> 01:27:45.305
ALL: No, no, no.

01:27:45.305 --> 01:27:48.984
LIAM: Are you saying what's in your head is
different than what's in my head?

01:27:48.984 --> 01:27:56.112
MATT: Okay. That was double sixes. So that's 22
plus eight is 30, so 15 points of slashing damage.

01:27:56.112 --> 01:28:00.308
On all those strikes against you. Pike? Two
attacks on you.

01:28:00.308 --> 01:28:02.105
SAM: You still alive there?

01:28:02.105 --> 01:28:07.960
MATT: That's a natural 20. And that's 15.

01:28:07.960 --> 01:28:09.001
ASHLEY: No.

01:28:09.001 --> 01:28:16.486
MATT: No, so. That is a one and two, so that's
three, six plus eight, you take 14 points of

01:28:16.486 --> 01:28:20.619
slashing damage from this barbarian female who's
all up on your grill.

01:28:20.619 --> 01:28:22.295
ASHLEY: I hate this bitch!

01:28:22.295 --> 01:28:27.768
MATT: Ending that turn, it's now the druid's turn
over here. End of surprise round, the druid's

01:28:27.768 --> 01:28:37.506
going to rush forward here. And do a 5th-level
Cure Wounds. On Kevdak.

01:28:37.506 --> 01:28:39.171
TALIESIN: No!

01:28:39.171 --> 01:28:43.320
MARISHA: I mean, he doesn't have an arm, he
doesn't have the arm. That was-- he can't get that back.

01:28:43.320 --> 01:28:45.338
LIAM: He can't get the bone or stuff, I hope.

01:28:45.338 --> 01:28:47.951
MARISHA: I know, how does that work if you only
have half your--

01:28:47.951 --> 01:28:49.557
LIAM: Ask that guy.

01:28:49.557 --> 01:28:54.112
MATT: All right, we're looking at 5d8.

01:28:54.112 --> 01:28:58.717
SAM: You know what? Fuck it. I'll Counterspell
that.

01:28:58.717 --> 01:29:06.514
MATT: Yeah, it's too high, or no, okay. So. It's
at a fifth level. Go ahead and roll for it,

01:29:06.514 --> 01:29:14.444
adding, so it's d20 plus five, plus two because of
your bardic knowledge.

01:29:14.444 --> 01:29:16.308
LAURA: That's not concentration, it doesn't do
anything.

01:29:16.308 --> 01:29:20.529
SAM: It's not concentration, right, Counterspell?
So what do I do, just a d20?

01:29:20.529 --> 01:29:22.250
MATT: Roll a d20, add seven.

01:29:22.250 --> 01:29:25.743
SAM: 17.

01:29:25.743 --> 01:29:32.379
MATT: Let me check here real fast. Plus the
spell's level. Yeah. It's dispelled.

01:29:32.379 --> 01:29:34.261
SAM: It's dispelled?

01:29:34.261 --> 01:29:35.357
MATT: Yeah, Counterspell.

01:29:35.357 --> 01:29:37.749
(cheering)

01:29:37.749 --> 01:29:40.062
MATT: It was 15, was what he had to beat.

01:29:40.062 --> 01:29:41.951
MARISHA: MVP this fight!

01:29:41.951 --> 01:29:43.633
TALIESIN: Oh my god, Sam. Oh my god.

01:29:43.633 --> 01:29:45.534
LIAM: Scanlan's going to Disneyworld!

01:29:45.534 --> 01:30:09.242
MATT: Okay. (laughs) All right. That ends his
turn. Now. So. This guy here, let's see. Got to

01:30:09.242 --> 01:30:10.874
stand up for this one, pardon me.

01:30:10.874 --> 01:30:12.370
SAM: Oh, shoot.

01:30:12.370 --> 01:30:19.758
LAURA: Shit. Shit.

01:30:19.758 --> 01:30:22.894
ASHLEY: Should we just take a break or something?

01:30:22.894 --> 01:30:32.108
SAM: The benches we're sitting on are covered in so
much ass sweat right now.

01:30:32.108 --> 01:30:35.855
MATT: We'll say for the sake of this, going to put
him up there.

01:30:35.855 --> 01:30:39.785
SAM: Who dat? Who's up there? What's going on
right there?

01:30:39.785 --> 01:30:41.518
MATT: This guy jumps up this way.

01:30:41.518 --> 01:30:44.972
SAM: Hey wait, well, that's where I am, I don't
want him to come up there!

01:30:44.972 --> 01:30:46.345
MATT: Too bad.

01:30:46.345 --> 01:30:47.810
TALIESIN: Does he get an attack of opportunity?

01:30:47.810 --> 01:30:53.946
MATT: These two guys rush forward and grab these
innocents here.

01:30:53.946 --> 01:30:55.967
LAURA: Oh my god. This is where it all turns.

01:30:55.967 --> 01:30:58.442
ASHLEY: Because I fucking fell off the fucking
roof.

01:30:58.442 --> 01:31:01.001
MATT: Yeah, into the middle here, towards the
fire.

01:31:01.001 --> 01:31:02.309
LIAM: Head of the snake.

01:31:02.309 --> 01:31:04.454
MARISHA: Into the fire? What?

01:31:04.454 --> 01:31:12.281
MATT: Pushing them towards the fire with what
remains of their movement. Let's see, this guy's

01:31:12.281 --> 01:31:19.121
going to move in towards Grog there. This archer's
going to get back up--

01:31:19.121 --> 01:31:21.955
SAM: (belches) Pardon me. Was that out loud?

01:31:21.955 --> 01:31:25.340
MARISHA: It's okay, we're not live.

01:31:25.340 --> 01:31:26.774
LAURA: No!

01:31:26.774 --> 01:31:31.283
MATT: Well actually, no, archers aren't part of
this movement. This guy here's going to move into

01:31:31.283 --> 01:31:32.711
Grog there.

01:31:32.711 --> 01:31:34.752
SAM: Now he has seven people attacking him.

01:31:34.752 --> 01:31:52.246
MATT: I don't know what to tell you, man. These
guys here, seeing, hah. This guy's going to be up

01:31:52.246 --> 01:31:56.921
with this one here. This guy can't really get over
there, so he's going to go ahead and rush

01:31:56.921 --> 01:31:58.187
forward.

01:31:58.187 --> 01:32:01.056
LAURA: How many people are there? I feel like
there's so many more people than there were.

01:32:01.056 --> 01:32:02.702
TALIESIN: How do you own this many models?

01:32:02.702 --> 01:32:05.743
LAURA: Why are you doing this to Pike? Stop
hurting her!

01:32:05.743 --> 01:32:08.273
SAM: Only you can protect her.

01:32:08.273 --> 01:32:10.257
ASHLEY: We should've killed the guys first.

01:32:10.257 --> 01:32:13.240
TALIESIN: There's no should'ves, this is what we
got.

01:32:13.240 --> 01:32:16.630
ASHLEY: Okay guys, we can do this, we can do
this.

01:32:16.630 --> 01:32:20.458
MARISHA: It was going pretty well.

01:32:20.458 --> 01:32:23.096
LAURA: Why did it all turn?

01:32:23.096 --> 01:32:24.812
MARISHA: How did he fucking scale that fast?

01:32:24.812 --> 01:32:27.199
LAURA: Because he can roll acrobatics just like we
can!

01:32:27.199 --> 01:32:30.882
MATT: Because they're-- yeah, you guys can do it,
they can do it too. And they're pretty strong. So

01:32:30.882 --> 01:32:35.655
he basically runs up, puts the sword on his back,
jumps up onto the roof, pulls the weapon. He

01:32:35.655 --> 01:32:38.209
doesn't manage to get an attack on you, because it
took all of his movement to get up there. But he

01:32:38.209 --> 01:32:39.452
gets up there.

01:32:39.452 --> 01:32:41.704
MARISHA: No one wants to fuck with the elemental?
Really? No one?

01:32:41.704 --> 01:32:48.326
MATT: Right now, you're not a huge threat to them
at the moment and they're both going to focus

01:32:48.326 --> 01:32:52.751
actually on you, Scanlan. When it gets around to
their turn, though. This guy's going to go ahead

01:32:52.751 --> 01:32:58.328
and pull both of these innocent folk in front of
them as a shield. This guy's going to get freaked

01:32:58.328 --> 01:33:05.556
out, rush around the building and try to escape
there. Okay. So! Bringing us into the combat

01:33:05.556 --> 01:33:12.361
portion of the round, Grog, you have two more
attacking you. This is the bladestorms.

01:33:12.361 --> 01:33:14.972
TRAVIS: Bladestorms?

01:33:14.972 --> 01:33:17.717
MATT: With advantage, that's going to be a 14.

01:33:17.717 --> 01:33:20.986
TRAVIS: That'll miss. I haven't said that much
tonight.

01:33:20.986 --> 01:33:22.228
MATT: 18?

01:33:22.228 --> 01:33:23.705
TRAVIS: That misses.

01:33:23.705 --> 01:33:27.365
MATT: So first one, both attacks swinging across
you, you're feeling it on your back, but it's

01:33:27.365 --> 01:33:31.563
catching most of your armor and part of your flesh
that is nice and calloused and does not really do

01:33:31.563 --> 01:33:40.382
any damage. The second one rolls a 20. Second one,
and second attack on the second one is a 21.

01:33:40.382 --> 01:33:42.573
TRAVIS: That hits, yeah.

01:33:42.573 --> 01:33:49.564
MATT: Yeah. Okay. So you get a critical and hit on
this one. So this is the bladestorm. Critical is

01:33:49.564 --> 01:33:59.920
going to be 16, eight points of slashing damage on
that one. And the next one's going to be four

01:33:59.920 --> 01:34:04.503
points of slashing damage. This is already halved.
Just so you know. So that's that round there.

01:34:04.503 --> 01:34:13.106
Against Pike, only one of them could get to you
and still attack this round, so Pike, that's 19?

01:34:13.106 --> 01:34:15.605
ASHLEY: Misses.

01:34:15.605 --> 01:34:18.387
MATT: And that's going to be a 15.

01:34:18.387 --> 01:34:19.714
ASHLEY: Misses.

01:34:19.714 --> 01:34:22.744
MATT: So one strikes against you, hits the back of
the armor and streaks off, so you spin around as

01:34:22.744 --> 01:34:25.509
the second blade comes around and you deflect it
with the shield angrily.

01:34:25.509 --> 01:34:26.702
MARISHA: Yes!

01:34:26.702 --> 01:34:28.388
ASHLEY: This is so fucking stressful!

01:34:28.388 --> 01:34:33.173
MATT: That brings us back to the top of the
initiative order. Vex, you're up.

01:34:33.173 --> 01:34:36.163
SAM: What, they just approached me, they didn't
attack me?

01:34:36.163 --> 01:34:39.296
MATT: Oh, there was the one guy that got up there
with movement. Thank you for the reminder. So

01:34:39.296 --> 01:34:42.930
before that happens, actually, reminder, this one
did have enough movement to get up there and still

01:34:42.930 --> 01:34:44.191
get attacks off on you.

01:34:44.191 --> 01:34:45.509
LAURA: Okay, he's attacking Percy.

01:34:45.509 --> 01:34:46.607
SAM: No, he's attacking me.

01:34:46.607 --> 01:34:48.172
LAURA: Oh.

01:34:48.172 --> 01:34:51.949
MATT: That's going to be a 13 with the first
strike.

01:34:51.949 --> 01:34:53.712
SAM: That misses.

01:34:53.712 --> 01:34:56.479
MATT: Misses, second one's going to be a 22.

01:34:56.479 --> 01:34:57.903
SAM: That just hits.

01:34:57.903 --> 01:35:00.044
(laughter)

01:35:00.044 --> 01:35:08.781
MATT: All right, that's going to be 17 points of
slashing damage from that greatsword, whoosh. I

01:35:08.781 --> 01:35:10.926
need you to go ahead and make a concentration
check.

01:35:10.926 --> 01:35:13.004
LAURA: Oh no!

01:35:13.004 --> 01:35:17.286
MATT: Yeah, you have Warcaster, so you have
advantage on that.

01:35:17.286 --> 01:35:18.481
LAURA: Come on, Scanlan.

01:35:18.481 --> 01:35:19.673
SAM: 15-- plus anything?

01:35:19.673 --> 01:35:21.321
MATT: It's a constitution.

01:35:21.321 --> 01:35:24.108
SAM: Ooh. Plus two. 17.

01:35:24.108 --> 01:35:25.338
MATT: So 17.

01:35:25.338 --> 01:35:26.835
TALIESIN: That's pretty good.

01:35:26.835 --> 01:35:34.003
MATT: Going to check it real fast, concentration
here-- plus ten, half the damage you take. So that

01:35:34.003 --> 01:35:36.718
would be ten, yeah, you maintain concentration.

01:35:36.718 --> 01:35:38.087
LAURA: Oh, thank god.

01:35:38.087 --> 01:35:42.318
TRAVIS: We might as well just be doing this on a
treadmill, because I think I'm pretty close to 130?

01:35:42.318 --> 01:35:43.820
MATT: All right, Vex, you're up.

01:35:43.820 --> 01:35:46.297
LAURA: Okay. I'm going to fly out of the window on
the broom.

01:35:46.297 --> 01:35:50.013
LIAM: The roof blows off.

01:35:50.013 --> 01:35:52.605
LAURA: Out of the window.

01:35:52.605 --> 01:35:55.803
MATT: Where do you want to go?

01:35:55.803 --> 01:36:06.053
LAURA: I'm going to fly down and I'm going to
shout, Grog! Raise your arm! And I'm going to go

01:36:06.053 --> 01:36:09.181
down and I'm going to hit his hand with the
Pokeball.

01:36:09.181 --> 01:36:10.703
LIAM: Shit.

01:36:10.703 --> 01:36:12.531
MATT: You're going to scoot by here?

01:36:12.531 --> 01:36:19.003
LAURA: I'm above, I want to be high up in the air
but low enough that I can reach down and touch the

01:36:19.003 --> 01:36:21.707
locket to Grog's hand.

01:36:21.707 --> 01:36:24.454
MATT: Okay, it's a good thing Kevdak is paralyzed,
because otherwise he'd get an attack on you.

01:36:24.454 --> 01:36:25.751
LAURA: I know, I know.

01:36:25.751 --> 01:36:28.028
MATT: This will put you in range for their
strikes, so you're going to have to stay in place

01:36:28.028 --> 01:36:31.330
or move past and suffer five attacks of
opportunity.

01:36:31.330 --> 01:36:34.566
LAURA: Wait, all of them can attack, but I'm in
the air!

01:36:34.566 --> 01:36:38.342
MATT: But for you to get low enough to hand him
that, they all have big double greatswords, and

01:36:38.342 --> 01:36:43.605
they're-- well, half of them are half-giants. So
you can do this. As you swish up, which you've

01:36:43.605 --> 01:36:46.014
already said you're going to do, you fly up and
you reach down.

01:36:46.014 --> 01:36:47.662
LAURA: With the locket and I hit.

01:36:47.662 --> 01:36:49.109
MATT: With the locket and you hand over to him, do
you--

01:36:49.109 --> 01:36:50.405
LAURA: I don't hand it to him.

01:36:50.405 --> 01:36:51.804
MATT: Okay. So you just hold it there?

01:36:51.804 --> 01:36:53.789
LAURA: I'm putting Grog in the fucking locket.

01:36:53.789 --> 01:36:56.018
MATT: Oh.

01:36:56.018 --> 01:36:58.721
TRAVIS: She's trying to medevac me.

01:36:58.721 --> 01:37:03.202
MATT: I misunderstood what you were trying to do.
All right, so, what--

01:37:03.202 --> 01:37:04.997
LAURA: I want to fly by and poof and keep going.

01:37:04.997 --> 01:37:06.362
MATT: What's it say again?

01:37:06.362 --> 01:37:08.697
LAURA: It's a wisdom save, but if it's a willing
person they can go in.

01:37:08.697 --> 01:37:11.085
MATT: Yeah. So, Grog, are you willing?

01:37:11.085 --> 01:37:14.531
TRAVIS: Well. Yes.

01:37:14.531 --> 01:37:22.787
MATT: And with that, as you reach down and touch
Grog with it, you see Grog's form shimmer for a

01:37:22.787 --> 01:37:25.766
second into dark shadow, and then vanish inside--

01:37:25.766 --> 01:37:28.431
LAURA: And I want to fly on past and go up to the
next roof.

01:37:28.431 --> 01:37:32.757
MATT: Okay. So Grog is currently off the table as
he's locked inside the gauntlet.

01:37:32.757 --> 01:37:34.800
LAURA: Where should I go, where should I go?

01:37:34.800 --> 01:37:37.699
MATT: Where are you going? As you rush away, you
do get--

01:37:37.699 --> 01:37:42.373
LAURA: I'm going to fly back into the-- I'm going
to fly around the back of the big building.

01:37:42.373 --> 01:37:43.496
MATT: Back here, you mean?

01:37:43.496 --> 01:37:44.558
LAURA: Yeah.

01:37:44.558 --> 01:37:50.508
MATT: Okay. We'll say for the purposes of this,
you are back here.

01:37:50.508 --> 01:37:51.774
LAURA: Okay.

01:37:51.774 --> 01:37:56.897
MATT: As you fly off from doing this, all of them
swing wide at you, that's five attacks of

01:37:56.897 --> 01:38:01.533
opportunity against you. That's 20.

01:38:01.533 --> 01:38:02.962
LAURA: Hits.

01:38:02.962 --> 01:38:05.080
MATT: That is 17.

01:38:05.080 --> 01:38:08.484
LAURA: It did? What'd you, what'd you give me?

01:38:08.484 --> 01:38:10.608
TRAVIS: Yeah, she gave you, she handed out, before
we moved out.

01:38:10.608 --> 01:38:12.461
LAURA: Oh, that's right, she gave me a blessing.

01:38:12.461 --> 01:38:15.417
MATT: Well, it's Aid, you have 15 extra hit
points. So that's what it is.

01:38:15.417 --> 01:38:16.607
LAURA: Oh, okay.

01:38:16.607 --> 01:38:18.373
ASHLEY: I thought it was the armor class goes up
one.

01:38:18.373 --> 01:38:19.898
SAM: I got 15 extra hit points.

01:38:19.898 --> 01:38:24.217
MATT: Yeah, Aid just gives you guys extra hit
points. So anyway. 17. Doesn't hit. All right. So

01:38:24.217 --> 01:38:28.287
three more attacks. That was cocked. 19?

01:38:28.287 --> 01:38:30.209
LAURA: It's my armor class.

01:38:30.209 --> 01:38:31.948
MATT: All right, 26?

01:38:31.948 --> 01:38:33.655
LAURA: Fuck. Balls. Shit. Mother bitch.

01:38:33.655 --> 01:38:36.077
MATT: And that's 19 again. So four attacks hit
you.

01:38:36.077 --> 01:38:37.179
LAURA: Okay.

01:38:37.179 --> 01:38:42.256
MATT: First one is for 14 points of slashing
damage.

01:38:42.256 --> 01:38:43.854
LAURA: Okay.

01:38:43.854 --> 01:38:55.482
MATT: Next one, hoo, that's eight, 12 points of
slashing damage.

01:38:55.482 --> 01:38:56.592
LAURA: Okay.

01:38:56.592 --> 01:38:59.032
SAM: Doubled. Halved.

01:38:59.032 --> 01:39:01.829
TALIESIN: Stop it! Don't be helpful!

01:39:01.829 --> 01:39:05.063
MATT: Nine plus four-- another 13 points of
slashing damage.

01:39:05.063 --> 01:39:06.653
LAURA: Dammit. Okay.

01:39:06.653 --> 01:39:10.849
MATT: And the last one. That's going to be 15
points of slashing damage.

01:39:10.849 --> 01:39:15.651
LAURA: Great, cool, great. I'm fine and I'm just
going to keep going.

01:39:15.651 --> 01:39:19.506
MATT: You streak off as all these blades hammer
into your side, cutting the bottom of your feet,

01:39:19.506 --> 01:39:23.858
one of them hits you in the back of the neck and
curves across your lower back, and as you pull

01:39:23.858 --> 01:39:28.208
away clutching it, you look at your hand with the
blood pooling in the middle of your palm, and you

01:39:28.208 --> 01:39:33.950
look at the gem with a faint glimmer of a form of
a human inside the gem that's currently mingling

01:39:33.950 --> 01:39:38.208
with all the blood that's smeared across your
body, as all of a sudden you coast around, through

01:39:38.208 --> 01:39:43.478
the air, the wind whirling past you, and you spin
around towards the top of the Margrave's estate.

01:39:43.478 --> 01:39:48.297
And you can hear the blood in your body--
(heartbeat sounds)-- in your ears as you start

01:39:48.297 --> 01:39:52.818
getting a little dizzy and realizing just how
rough you are at the moment from that exchange.

01:39:52.818 --> 01:39:54.061
LAURA: Okay.

01:39:54.061 --> 01:39:55.296
MARISHA: Wow.

01:39:55.296 --> 01:40:06.259
MATT: Technically you'd probably be higher than
this. Up there, if you wanted to fly around. Okay.

01:40:06.259 --> 01:40:07.920
So. That ends your turn?

01:40:07.920 --> 01:40:11.342
LAURA: That-- yeah.

01:40:11.342 --> 01:40:12.734
MATT: Vax, you're up.

01:40:12.734 --> 01:40:16.865
LIAM: I'm going to use my bonus action to dash,
and hasted I get 24 squares of movement

01:40:16.865 --> 01:40:17.829
on this board.

01:40:17.829 --> 01:40:18.891
MATT: Yes.

01:40:18.891 --> 01:40:22.665
LIAM: I'm going to drop off the roof, staying
along the wall, I should be able to take a

01:40:22.665 --> 01:40:26.240
diagonal at that corner and totally avoid
Greenbeard.

01:40:26.240 --> 01:40:27.974
MATT: Oh, you mean, dodge off--?

01:40:27.974 --> 01:40:32.250
LIAM: I want to go, no, I want to go straight this
way. Towards the tree, and drop.

01:40:32.250 --> 01:40:34.077
MATT: Towards the tree, drop off here?

01:40:34.077 --> 01:40:41.234
LIAM: All right. Yep. I want to go along the wall.
I can swoop around it and avoid Greenbeard, I'm

01:40:41.234 --> 01:40:45.465
going to run past this barbarian, she'll probably
take an attack but I'm wearing that cloak so she's

01:40:45.465 --> 01:40:51.508
at disadvantage. I'm going to run up to Kevdak and
I'm going to stab him twice-- I should get sneak

01:40:51.508 --> 01:40:53.602
attack damage and a crit, because he's frozen.

01:40:53.602 --> 01:40:54.724
MATT: You do.

01:40:54.724 --> 01:40:56.639
LIAM: Then I'm going to run the fuck out. That's
what I'd like to do.

01:40:56.639 --> 01:40:57.566
MATT: Okay.

01:40:57.566 --> 01:40:58.824
(laughter)

01:40:58.824 --> 01:41:02.021
MATT: You rush up, you manage to avoid Greenbeard,
there is one of these guys there who was holding

01:41:02.021 --> 01:41:05.894
his place, seeing what things were going on, he
had no target at the moment, was staying nearby.

01:41:05.894 --> 01:41:11.513
With disadvantage, that is 21?

01:41:11.513 --> 01:41:13.544
LIAM: Misses. 22.

01:41:13.544 --> 01:41:14.617
MATT: 22!

01:41:14.617 --> 01:41:18.827
LIAM: Daggers out, hasted. Raven Queen armor, fuck
y'all.

01:41:18.827 --> 01:41:25.059
MATT: As you dart past, this blur of dark motion
swings towards you, and where it is about to catch

01:41:25.059 --> 01:41:29.751
some of the armor, there's a burst of black
feathers that lift behind where the blade struck

01:41:29.751 --> 01:41:35.356
through. As you dart up right into the face of
Kevdak, who's like, (strained sound), trying

01:41:35.356 --> 01:41:39.398
desperately to resist the effect of this. Go for
it. Advantage on the attacks.

01:41:39.398 --> 01:41:40.724
LIAM: Okay. Advantage on all these, right right
right.

01:41:40.724 --> 01:41:42.663
LAURA: Oh my god. Ermagerd.

01:41:42.663 --> 01:41:51.020
LIAM: Ermagerd. 22 for the first, which hits. Ah,
yeah, they both hit. And 26 for the second. First

01:41:51.020 --> 01:42:07.049
one. Three plus-- oh my god. Three plus-- Eight,
ten, 16, 22, 23, 29, 32. Which is doubled to 64

01:42:07.049 --> 01:42:08.802
plus six.

01:42:08.802 --> 01:42:10.785
MATT: Well, 32 plus six, because he takes
half-damage.

01:42:10.785 --> 01:42:19.453
LIAM: Right, well, let's get it up to the top and
then halve it. So 32 to 64 plus six is 72 halved.

01:42:19.453 --> 01:42:22.923
MATT: Right, 72 halved puts you at 36.

01:42:22.923 --> 01:42:33.060
LIAM: That's the first, and then the second one
does two plus six is eight, no, two and,

01:42:33.060 --> 01:42:34.693
da-ba-ba-ba--

01:42:34.693 --> 01:42:37.309
LAURA: Four, right?

01:42:37.309 --> 01:42:39.150
LIAM: That's just the dice is doubled, so four,
it's ten.

01:42:39.150 --> 01:42:40.431
MATT: All right.

01:42:40.431 --> 01:42:42.323
LIAM: And I'd like to use the rest of, well, go
ahead.

01:42:42.323 --> 01:42:48.799
MATT: So yeah, so as you rush up, you slam your
dagger square into the side of his body, and as

01:42:48.799 --> 01:42:52.761
you push it inside, you can see his eyes glancing
back down towards you, held in place, his arm

01:42:52.761 --> 01:42:58.946
broken, still dangling from the little elements of
ligaments that keep it shifting there. With the

01:42:58.946 --> 01:43:03.843
impact of the slam, it swings from the sheer force
of the blow. As you push the blade to the hilt and

01:43:03.843 --> 01:43:08.252
even further in, you feel your hands actually push
into the wound itself about an inch, your fingers

01:43:08.252 --> 01:43:14.561
getting dark and wet with the crimson gore of the
interior of his body. As you push up inside, you

01:43:14.561 --> 01:43:20.596
pull back, pulling the blade around, in your
pommel, and jam it over the top of the shoulder,

01:43:20.596 --> 01:43:26.767
into the side of his body, the muscle flexes from
the tension of the Hold Person spell, managing to

01:43:26.767 --> 01:43:29.527
reduce a portion of the damage, but it left a
pretty serious wound.

01:43:29.527 --> 01:43:35.903
LIAM: Any movement I have left, I want to use to
run up to the other side of the wall that Keyleth

01:43:35.903 --> 01:43:41.718
is on. If I have enough, I'll climb up, if not,
I'll go behind that barrel. But if I, before I go,

01:43:41.718 --> 01:43:46.238
quietly I say to Kevdak, your fate is sealed here
today, my friend.

01:43:46.238 --> 01:43:50.744
MATT: Okay. He does not get an attack of
opportunity on you because he is paralyzed, and

01:43:50.744 --> 01:43:54.080
the guy already took one against you so he already
used his reaction, you rush past him. You do not

01:43:54.080 --> 01:43:59.405
have enough movement to get to the top, but you do
get to the corner right where the barrel is. Okay?

01:43:59.405 --> 01:44:00.751
LIAM: Yeah.

01:44:00.751 --> 01:44:02.895
MATT: That ends your turn. It's now the archers'
turn.

01:44:02.895 --> 01:44:04.028
LAURA: Oh god.

01:44:04.028 --> 01:44:08.401
SAM: Oh god. So much bloodshed.

01:44:08.401 --> 01:44:13.423
TRAVIS: Can we do some recreational drugs or
something? Take the edge off?

01:44:13.423 --> 01:44:15.164
LAURA: We're going to, we're all going to die.

01:44:15.164 --> 01:44:18.864
SAM: All we got to do is get Kevdak and they're
fucking lost.

01:44:18.864 --> 01:44:23.164
TALIESIN: I've got a Scrooge McDuck-sized pit of
Xanax at my house I'm just going to dive into.

01:44:23.164 --> 01:44:29.419
LAURA: Once we kill him, his gauntlets are going
to be there, we have to go in and

01:44:29.419 --> 01:44:30.750
get his gauntlets.

01:44:30.750 --> 01:44:38.277
SAM: Yeah, that's a point, that's a point made.
You know who could get them, who's fast and

01:44:38.277 --> 01:44:40.361
strong? Trinket.

01:44:40.361 --> 01:44:45.136
MATT: This guy here is going to go ahead, he's out
of range of you, Marisha. Shoving this barrel off

01:44:45.136 --> 01:44:47.425
the side to try and get away from you.

01:44:47.425 --> 01:44:48.692
TALIESIN: Attack of opportunity.

01:44:48.692 --> 01:44:51.146
MATT: Marisha, you do get an attack of
opportunity, it does fall and hit the barrel next

01:44:51.146 --> 01:44:55.806
to you, I mean, next to Vax. It doesn't hit you,
but it spooks you momentarily as it slams onto the

01:44:55.806 --> 01:44:57.701
barrel next to your side and rolls off.

01:44:57.701 --> 01:44:59.118
MARISHA: Rolling terribly.

01:44:59.118 --> 01:45:00.499
MATT: What'd you get, Keyleth?

01:45:00.499 --> 01:45:01.502
MARISHA: Ten total.

01:45:01.502 --> 01:45:03.325
MATT: Ten total? Misses.

01:45:03.325 --> 01:45:06.370
MARISHA: Oh no, oh, I had to roll to hit. I'm
sorry, I was rolling damage.

01:45:06.370 --> 01:45:07.708
MATT: What'd you roll?

01:45:07.708 --> 01:45:13.661
MARISHA: I didn't roll to hit. To hit, that is,
plus, 16 to hit?

01:45:13.661 --> 01:45:17.355
MATT: 16 versus the archer? 17. Just misses.

01:45:17.355 --> 01:45:20.823
SAM: You really... blew it.

01:45:20.823 --> 01:45:23.064
TALIESIN: To be fair, she's a bit winded.

01:45:23.064 --> 01:45:25.737
SAM: Oh, she's winded, that's nice, that's nice.

01:45:25.737 --> 01:45:32.912
MATT: They're both, having now made out the
connection between the mooning and Kevdak holding

01:45:32.912 --> 01:45:37.370
himself in place, they're both trying to take you
out. One of them has disadvantage because you're

01:45:37.370 --> 01:45:40.833
in its spot and it couldn't get away from you, it
had nowhere to go really. So one's taking two

01:45:40.833 --> 01:45:45.299
attacks at you, Scanlan. That is going to be, heh,
a 12.

01:45:45.299 --> 01:45:46.430
SAM: Miss.

01:45:46.430 --> 01:45:47.896
MATT: And a 26.

01:45:47.896 --> 01:45:48.837
SAM: Hit.

01:45:48.837 --> 01:45:53.486
MATT: The other one's going to have two attacks
with disadvantage against you. That's, even with

01:45:53.486 --> 01:45:54.998
disadvantage, that's a 21.

01:45:54.998 --> 01:45:56.101
SAM: Hit.

01:45:56.101 --> 01:45:59.298
MATT: And the other one with disadvantage is a
15.

01:45:59.298 --> 01:46:00.708
SAM: Hit.

01:46:00.708 --> 01:46:03.205
LAURA: What? 15 hits you?

01:46:03.205 --> 01:46:05.460
SAM: I am not wearing some things.

01:46:05.460 --> 01:46:07.332
MATT: Yeah, it's true. So three attacks hit you.

01:46:07.332 --> 01:46:09.060
SAM: Yeah.

01:46:09.060 --> 01:46:17.053
MATT: The first one is going to be, all right.
That's a full ten plus--

01:46:17.053 --> 01:46:19.882
14 points of piercing damage.

01:46:19.882 --> 01:46:21.766
SAM: Okay.

01:46:21.766 --> 01:46:24.991
MATT: Go ahead and roll your concentration.

01:46:24.991 --> 01:46:26.552
SAM: Oh, yeah, that.

01:46:26.552 --> 01:46:28.146
MATT: So roll and add two.

01:46:28.146 --> 01:46:31.190
SAM: Roll and add two, or?

01:46:31.190 --> 01:46:32.609
MATT: Because it's plus your constitution.

01:46:32.609 --> 01:46:33.695
SAM: Oh. 19.

01:46:33.695 --> 01:46:39.251
MATT: 19? Okay. The next attack deals five points.
Go ahead and roll again with advantage.

01:46:39.251 --> 01:46:44.396
SAM: 19.

01:46:44.396 --> 01:46:53.064
MATT: Damn. All right. And the third one. Yeah,
what's your constitution saving throw, it's plus

01:46:53.064 --> 01:46:54.079
two, right?

01:46:54.079 --> 01:46:55.107
SAM: Yep.

01:46:55.107 --> 01:46:59.663
MATT: Last one does 11 points of piercing damage
to you. And make another series of checks for

01:46:59.663 --> 01:47:01.029
concentration.

01:47:01.029 --> 01:47:03.133
SAM: 17.

01:47:03.133 --> 01:47:04.278
MATT: Fine.

01:47:04.278 --> 01:47:06.216
LAURA: We're fine, we're okay, we're okay?

01:47:06.216 --> 01:47:13.959
MATT: That Warcaster feat, man. Okay, that
finishes those two guys. This one here's off to

01:47:13.959 --> 01:47:20.636
the side, this one's going to go ahead and turn
around this way and get around the edge. Actually,

01:47:20.636 --> 01:47:21.925
he's going to--

01:47:21.925 --> 01:47:23.279
LAURA: I'm going to start crying.

01:47:23.279 --> 01:47:28.318
MATT: This one over here didn't notice you swing
by over the top, swoosh overhead. It does see

01:47:28.318 --> 01:47:36.359
Percy on the roof that shot it, you do have
partial cover, so. We'll say that's half cover, so

01:47:36.359 --> 01:47:48.691
plus two to your AC against this guy's two arrow
shots against you. All righty. That is 26 to hit.

01:47:48.691 --> 01:47:50.146
TALIESIN: Well, that hits.

01:47:50.146 --> 01:47:52.308
MATT: All right. Second strike. Same thing, 26.

01:47:52.308 --> 01:47:53.466
TALIESIN: All right.

01:47:53.466 --> 01:47:54.540
MATT: 18 and 18.

01:47:54.540 --> 01:48:01.195
TALIESIN: 18 and 18? I can use the-- yeah, I only
have one reaction, so. All right.

01:48:01.195 --> 01:48:05.785
MATT: So that's nine points of piercing damage
with the first shot.

01:48:05.785 --> 01:48:06.999
TALIESIN: I'll take that.

01:48:06.999 --> 01:48:08.759
MATT: And 14 points of piercing damage with the
second one.

01:48:08.759 --> 01:48:10.218
TALIESIN: I'll fight that one, I'll contest that.

01:48:10.218 --> 01:48:11.692
SAM: This has been a long fight, guys.

01:48:11.692 --> 01:48:14.041
LIAM: No, this is like 30 seconds later, if that.

01:48:14.041 --> 01:48:16.174
MATT: What are you contesting it with?

01:48:16.174 --> 01:48:19.084
TALIESIN: Gloves of Missile Snaring.

01:48:19.084 --> 01:48:20.695
MATT: How many times can you use that?

01:48:20.695 --> 01:48:25.808
TALIESIN: It's a reaction. It doesn't say, I can
make an attempt to catch.

01:48:25.808 --> 01:48:27.461
MATT: Yeah. So go ahead and make the attempt.

01:48:27.461 --> 01:48:28.719
TALIESIN: That's 14 points?

01:48:28.719 --> 01:48:30.005
MATT: 14 points, yeah.

01:48:30.005 --> 01:48:42.372
TALIESIN: Dexterity modifier, 11, so I can reduce
it to three points of damage. I still got hit, so.

01:48:42.372 --> 01:48:47.811
MATT: So go ahead and mark that. Okay. And this
guy over here at the very top moves over as well

01:48:47.811 --> 01:48:54.616
and is going to go ahead and take two more shots
at Scanlan. Since there's currently not a whole

01:48:54.616 --> 01:49:00.782
lot he can see in the area that's a threat to him,
near this gleaming beacon of pink and purple up on

01:49:00.782 --> 01:49:06.874
the rooftop another friend of his is currently
whaling on, so. Two attacks against you. That's

01:49:06.874 --> 01:49:09.814
going to be a 19.

01:49:09.814 --> 01:49:11.124
SAM: Hit.

01:49:11.124 --> 01:49:12.608
MATT: And 23.

01:49:12.608 --> 01:49:13.738
SAM: Hit.

01:49:13.738 --> 01:49:17.766
MATT: All right. You take another six points of
piercing damage. Go ahead and make your--

01:49:17.766 --> 01:49:19.665
SAM: Yeah, 20.

01:49:19.665 --> 01:49:24.471
MATT: What was it? 20? Okay. Second one is 14
points of piercing damage.

01:49:24.471 --> 01:49:25.788
TALIESIN: Oh, Jesus.

01:49:25.788 --> 01:49:31.568
SAM: Six.

01:49:31.568 --> 01:49:38.459
MATT: And with that, the Hold Person fades,
concentration lost from the barrage of arrows from

01:49:38.459 --> 01:49:48.334
the nearby Herd archers. You hear a roar across
the battlefield, (roars). Currently with one

01:49:48.334 --> 01:49:55.094
busted arm, no arm on the other side, Kevdak is
screaming in terrible pain and anger.

01:49:55.094 --> 01:49:56.972
LIAM: But he's great at riverdance.

01:49:56.972 --> 01:49:59.326
(laughter)

01:49:59.326 --> 01:50:04.365
MATT: All right, archers finish their turn. It
comes to Kevdak's turn. He's going to go ahead and

01:50:04.365 --> 01:50:13.248
use his bonus action to go ahead and use Second
Wind. Heals 17 hit points on that, rolled a ten.

01:50:13.248 --> 01:50:24.809
He is then going to-- let's see. Huh.

01:50:24.809 --> 01:50:26.400
MARISHA: No one's around him.

01:50:26.400 --> 01:50:28.793
MATT: Yeah, he has no axe. He reaches over and
picks up your hammer.

01:50:28.793 --> 01:50:30.604
TALIESIN: With his broken hand?

01:50:30.604 --> 01:50:33.874
MATT: Oh, yeah, no, actually no, he can't do that
right now.

01:50:33.874 --> 01:50:35.458
SAM: With his beak.

01:50:35.458 --> 01:50:37.825
LAURA: He kicks the hammer.

01:50:37.825 --> 01:50:40.900
MARISHA: He, yeah. He teabags it.

01:50:40.900 --> 01:50:43.472
TRAVIS: He kills one of his subordinates for
letting him--

01:50:43.472 --> 01:50:49.607
MATT: Yeah, he turns to one of his subordinates to
the side and says, "One of you, pick that up. The

01:50:49.607 --> 01:50:53.894
"rest of you, kill them." And looks over to the
other two innocent that are on the ground right

01:50:53.894 --> 01:50:59.484
now. He then is going to go ahead and start moving
over towards Greenbeard.

01:50:59.484 --> 01:51:00.929
SAM: Because he moves.

01:51:00.929 --> 01:51:02.079
MATT: Yes?

01:51:02.079 --> 01:51:05.552
SAM: Does Pike get an attack of opportunity?

01:51:05.552 --> 01:51:06.840
LAURA: Oh, the Spiritual Weapon!

01:51:06.840 --> 01:51:13.331
MATT: A Spiritual Weapon is technically not a
creature. It doesn't get a reaction. It's only on

01:51:13.331 --> 01:51:18.664
a bonus action you get a chance to attack with it.
Yeah. He's going to move over here, around the

01:51:18.664 --> 01:51:25.304
flames, up to Greenbeard. Okay. That finishes his
turn, there's not much else he can do at this

01:51:25.304 --> 01:51:27.318
point. Scanlan, you're up.

01:51:27.318 --> 01:51:28.827
SAM: Pike, how you doing?

01:51:28.827 --> 01:51:38.421
ASHLEY: I'm at 20. I'm pretty rough. It's okay,
it's okay, it's okay. I have an idea to try and

01:51:38.421 --> 01:51:40.327
get out of it if I need to.

01:51:40.327 --> 01:51:41.868
SAM: Kevdak or Pike?

01:51:41.868 --> 01:51:45.345
LAURA: They're all clustered right there. If you
have something that does area.

01:51:45.345 --> 01:51:47.560
SAM: They are, I don't care about them, I just
care about Kevdak.

01:51:47.560 --> 01:51:49.053
LIAM: End the fight, Scanlan.

01:51:49.053 --> 01:51:51.060
LAURA: Well, Greenbeard can probably heal Kevdak.

01:51:51.060 --> 01:51:52.125
SAM: All right.

01:51:52.125 --> 01:51:54.367
MARISHA: That's probably what he's going over
there for.

01:51:54.367 --> 01:52:01.843
SAM: I don't think I'll be able to do a Fireball
without hitting either Kiki or that innocent.

01:52:01.843 --> 01:52:06.951
MARISHA: I'm fine, I haven't taken any damage.

01:52:06.951 --> 01:52:08.341
TALIESIN: She's up 60 bonus hit points.

01:52:08.341 --> 01:52:10.737
MARISHA: No, I'm up 90 bonus hit points and I
haven't taken any damage.

01:52:10.737 --> 01:52:14.865
SAM: All right. I'll do the same thing, then.
Shit.

01:52:14.865 --> 01:52:19.564
MATT: What're you doing, Scanlan?

01:52:19.564 --> 01:52:22.054
SAM: Yep. The Wand of Fireballs again.

01:52:22.054 --> 01:52:23.185
MATT: How many--

01:52:23.185 --> 01:52:26.836
SAM: I have seven charges, I've used three, I'll use
three more.

01:52:26.836 --> 01:52:30.442
MATT: Okay, where, in the center here at Kevdak?

01:52:30.442 --> 01:52:32.502
SAM: Yes, Kevdak is the center square.

01:52:32.502 --> 01:52:34.749
MATT: That would hit that archer.

01:52:34.749 --> 01:52:36.426
SAM: Would it hit that innocent?

01:52:36.426 --> 01:52:39.322
MATT: It would hit those innocents there, both of
those innocents.

01:52:39.322 --> 01:52:42.314
SAM: Okay. Angle it a little over towards Kiki so
it doesn't hit the innocent?

01:52:42.314 --> 01:52:45.093
MATT: Yeah, with your angle, you could angle it
this way.

01:52:45.093 --> 01:52:46.901
SAM: Oh, would it hit Vax that way?

01:52:46.901 --> 01:52:48.046
MATT: Yeah, it would.

01:52:48.046 --> 01:52:49.353
LIAM: It's all right. Do it.

01:52:49.353 --> 01:52:50.604
SAM: Okay, I'll kill the innocent.

01:52:50.604 --> 01:52:51.547
LIAM: Do it!

01:52:51.547 --> 01:52:53.475
SAM: I'll kill the innocent.

01:52:53.475 --> 01:52:57.589
LIAM: I can dodge that shit! I can dodge that
shit!

01:52:57.589 --> 01:52:59.753
LAURA: Scanlan! Don't hurt the innocents!

01:52:59.753 --> 01:53:01.314
SAM: I said it already, it's too late.

01:53:01.314 --> 01:53:05.515
MATT: Yep. So Scanlan fires the Fireball at
Kevdak, it detonates.

01:53:05.515 --> 01:53:07.556
LIAM: I could've avoided it completely.

01:53:07.556 --> 01:53:11.909
SAM: Okay. Yes. Do I just roll? 10d8.

01:53:11.909 --> 01:53:13.777
TALIESIN: 10d6.

01:53:13.777 --> 01:53:15.331
SAM: Six. Six, yes.

01:53:15.331 --> 01:53:21.190
MATT: Kevdak, save for that, yeah, he makes his
save.

01:53:21.190 --> 01:53:23.001
MARISHA: Gah, fucking fucker.

01:53:23.001 --> 01:53:27.261
MATT: Because it's DC 15. Greenbeard also makes
his save.

01:53:27.261 --> 01:53:29.278
SAM: 42.

01:53:29.278 --> 01:53:40.562
MATT: 42. Damn. (counting) Ten. So Kevdak takes
ten points of fire damage.

01:53:40.562 --> 01:53:43.840
SAM: Ten? He made his save.

01:53:43.840 --> 01:53:47.427
MATT: Because he made his save for half damage,
and then he takes half that from his rage.

01:53:47.427 --> 01:53:55.370
Greenbeard takes 21. He's looking rough,
Greenbeard is now burned and (grunts) is looking a

01:53:55.370 --> 01:54:02.898
bit frenzied at this point. The archer does make
the save, high dex, they take 21 points on him.

01:54:02.898 --> 01:54:06.465
SAM: (belches) Pardon me.

01:54:06.465 --> 01:54:17.406
MATT: This archer there also makes it. However,
that one's taken-- no, that one hasn't taken a lot

01:54:17.406 --> 01:54:25.694
of damage, it was that one over there. This one
here does also make his save.

01:54:25.694 --> 01:54:28.552
SAM: Ah, Jesus. These guys are unkillable.

01:54:28.552 --> 01:54:30.250
MARISHA: They all made their saves.

01:54:30.250 --> 01:54:32.743
LAURA: Surprise attack would've been really good
on these guys.

01:54:32.743 --> 01:54:40.604
MATT: That guy there does make his save, they're
all rolling 15 or above on this.

01:54:40.604 --> 01:54:41.972
LAURA: God.

01:54:41.972 --> 01:54:47.758
MATT: This guy here rolls a natural 20 on his
save.

01:54:47.758 --> 01:54:49.545
LAURA: Fuck all of them!

01:54:49.545 --> 01:54:53.126
MATT: Well, that was the innocent there.

01:54:53.185 --> 01:54:55.170
ALL: Oh.

01:54:55.170 --> 01:54:56.386
MARISHA: Good job, guy.

01:54:56.386 --> 01:54:58.508
MATT: It's still 21 points of damage for a
peasant, he is incinerated and you hear the

01:54:58.508 --> 01:55:00.773
horrible scream of pain as--

01:55:00.773 --> 01:55:02.764
SAM: Hey, we killed something, guys!

01:55:02.764 --> 01:55:04.864
LAURA: That was the first thing we killed in this
fight.

01:55:04.864 --> 01:55:06.755
MATT: First thing you killed in this fight was an
innocent villager.

01:55:06.755 --> 01:55:08.698
LAURA: That is terrible.

01:55:08.698 --> 01:55:12.298
MATT: And with that scream that echoes in the back
of your mind, knowing the decision you made, a

01:55:12.298 --> 01:55:17.827
little part of your heart sinks in your chest.
However, Keyleth, I need you to go ahead and make

01:55:17.827 --> 01:55:19.343
a dexterity save as well.

01:55:19.343 --> 01:55:22.075
MARISHA: Yeah. On it. Natural 19.

01:55:22.075 --> 01:55:23.967
MATT: All right, so you take 21 points of fire
damage.

01:55:23.967 --> 01:55:28.338
SAM: Even though I can't see her--

01:55:28.338 --> 01:55:37.430
MATT: And actually, that guy technically would
be-- yeah, that innocent there would also be in

01:55:37.430 --> 01:55:41.610
range. He doesn't make his save, he is also
incinerated. Both of them burn.

01:55:41.610 --> 01:55:45.904
MARISHA: Whoops.

01:55:45.904 --> 01:55:47.637
LAURA: Two peasants dead.

01:55:47.637 --> 01:55:49.066
SAM: Sorry.

01:55:49.066 --> 01:55:51.447
MATT: All right. So.

01:55:51.447 --> 01:55:58.288
SAM: Even though I can't see her, I'm so connected
to her, can I try to heal Pike with a big shout?

01:55:58.288 --> 01:56:02.902
MATT: As a Healing Word spell? A creature you can
see within range, so no, you have to be able to

01:56:02.902 --> 01:56:04.374
see her to aid her.

01:56:04.374 --> 01:56:05.511
SAM: Okay.

01:56:05.511 --> 01:56:08.890
MATT: Which you could do if you wanted to risk
it.

01:56:08.890 --> 01:56:12.301
SAM: I don't know if I want to move, this guy is
on me.

01:56:12.301 --> 01:56:14.620
TALIESIN: Yeah, but you're also getting pummeled
by arrows.

01:56:14.620 --> 01:56:16.012
LAURA: That's true.

01:56:16.012 --> 01:56:18.576
TALIESIN: So maybe standing there is not
necessarily the--

01:56:18.576 --> 01:56:21.223
LAURA: Like, up and over would probably be
better.

01:56:21.223 --> 01:56:23.393
SAM: He's going to take a whack at me.

01:56:23.393 --> 01:56:25.796
TALIESIN: He's going to take a whack at you
in a minute anyway.

01:56:25.796 --> 01:56:27.194
LIAM: Can't you stay alongside him the whole
time?

01:56:27.194 --> 01:56:29.965
LAURA: Yeah. If you're within five feet of him, he
doesn't attack.

01:56:29.965 --> 01:56:31.018
LIAM: Just circle him.

01:56:31.018 --> 01:56:34.558
SAM: Okay. I'll circle. I don't know, I can't even
really see where I am, but. Yeah.

01:56:34.558 --> 01:56:37.301
LIAM: Just going around him. Kitty-corner.

01:56:37.301 --> 01:56:39.571
MATT: So yeah, you get over this side here.

01:56:39.571 --> 01:56:40.902
LIAM: Oh, he's dead.

01:56:40.902 --> 01:56:42.415
LAURA: (laughs) Every time.

01:56:42.415 --> 01:56:48.370
MATT: All right, so you move around him. And you
see Pike now surrounded by a number of the

01:56:48.370 --> 01:56:49.544
barbarians.

01:56:49.544 --> 01:56:50.936
LAURA: Oh no!

01:56:50.936 --> 01:56:52.428
MATT: You can use your bonus action to heal her if
you'd like.

01:56:52.428 --> 01:56:54.194
SAM: You have some plan or something, right?

01:56:54.194 --> 01:56:56.869
ASHLEY: I mean, who the fuck knows if that's going
to fucking work?

01:56:56.869 --> 01:57:03.490
SAM: My healing is barely anything. So
I'll inspire you instead, I think.

01:57:03.490 --> 01:57:05.226
ASHLEY: Okay. I'll take it, I'll take it.

01:57:05.226 --> 01:57:06.503
MATT: How do you inspire her?

01:57:06.503 --> 01:57:16.892
SAM: I sing, (singing) Well then I saw her mace,
now I'm a believer, without a trace, of blood in

01:57:16.892 --> 01:57:20.152
her hair. I'm in love.

01:57:20.152 --> 01:57:22.267
ALL: (singing) Ooh-ahh.

01:57:22.267 --> 01:57:24.198
SAM: (singing) I'm a believer.

01:57:24.198 --> 01:57:25.454
MATT: (singing) Take your d10.

01:57:25.454 --> 01:57:28.228
ASHLEY: (singing) I'll take my d10, use it later.

01:57:28.228 --> 01:57:33.561
MATT: Ends Scanlan's turn. That's the end of your
turn. Grog, you are sealed. You have no turn.

01:57:33.561 --> 01:57:37.784
LAURA: Sorry, Grog. I was trying to keep you from
dying.

01:57:37.784 --> 01:57:43.827
MATT: Brings us to Greenbeard, who's in a rough
place right now. Greenbeard is going to go ahead

01:57:43.827 --> 01:57:46.462
and finally do something.

01:57:46.462 --> 01:57:51.308
SAM: God dammit, he's going to heal fucking
Kevdak. It's a new round.

01:57:51.308 --> 01:57:57.555
MATT: "Kevdak. Protect the Herd." And he reaches
forward and touches him.

01:57:57.555 --> 01:57:59.662
ASHLEY: Fuck that guy.

01:57:59.662 --> 01:58:03.502
SAM: Yeah, I'll counterspell that too.

01:58:03.502 --> 01:58:06.873
MATT: As he's right there. That's Heal.

01:58:06.873 --> 01:58:10.315
MARISHA: No, I knew it, I knew it, it's going to
heal him for all of his hit points.

01:58:10.315 --> 01:58:11.812
SAM: I'm counterspelling.

01:58:11.812 --> 01:58:18.097
MATT: Okay, so that's a 6th-level. Go ahead and
roll, add seven, and you have to get 16 or higher.

01:58:18.097 --> 01:58:20.577
SAM: Can I cast it at a higher level?

01:58:20.577 --> 01:58:22.219
MARISHA: Heal is a 7th-level spell.

01:58:22.219 --> 01:58:24.046
MATT: What level are you casting Counterspell at?

01:58:24.046 --> 01:58:28.704
SAM: Do I know what this spell is?

01:58:28.704 --> 01:58:33.224
MATT: No, Heal, 70. Old version was almost all
your hit points.

01:58:33.224 --> 01:58:36.471
SAM: Fifth level.

01:58:36.471 --> 01:58:43.896
MATT: At fifth level? All right, so you're casting
it at fifth level. Counterspell, mark that off.

01:58:43.896 --> 01:58:49.971
Less than or equal to the level of the spell slot
you use. So it is fifth level, doesn't do

01:58:49.971 --> 01:58:57.227
anything. Because what fifth level does is it
increases the equal level of the spell to cancel.

01:58:57.227 --> 01:59:02.857
Fifth level, it's a 6th-level spell, so now you
just roll. So now roll. Add seven. You're trying

01:59:02.857 --> 01:59:04.609
to get 16 or higher.

01:59:04.609 --> 01:59:05.954
LAURA: No!

01:59:05.954 --> 01:59:07.382
ASHLEY: What is it, what is it, what is it?

01:59:07.382 --> 01:59:11.225
SAM: It was a three. But I get advantage.

01:59:11.225 --> 01:59:12.845
MATT: No.

01:59:12.845 --> 01:59:14.514
SAM: Because I'm wearing this.

01:59:14.514 --> 01:59:20.548
MATT: With that, Greenbeard reaches out and
touches Kevdak. Kevdak roars in pain as all of a

01:59:20.548 --> 01:59:27.463
sudden the muscles and tendons in his arm reform
and in his still-wounded but now-functional arm,

01:59:27.463 --> 01:59:32.465
he crushes the gauntlet in his hand. "Bring me the
other!"

01:59:32.465 --> 01:59:33.929
LAURA: Shit.

01:59:33.929 --> 01:59:36.915
MATT: And you see the other one who was over there
reach for the gauntlet.

01:59:36.915 --> 01:59:39.014
MARISHA: God dammit, I was about to handle that. I
was about to handle that!

01:59:39.014 --> 01:59:40.679
Who's bringing him the gauntlet?

01:59:40.679 --> 01:59:46.367
MATT: Greenbeard is now going to go ahead and back
behind here, trying to get behind the tree as he

01:59:46.367 --> 01:59:48.040
now notices he's in the open.

01:59:48.040 --> 01:59:49.201
LIAM: Burn him up.

01:59:49.201 --> 01:59:53.524
MATT: Done his business in that moment. No, as a
bonus action, he's going to go ahead and turn into

01:59:53.524 --> 01:59:55.046
an earth elemental.

01:59:55.046 --> 01:59:56.087
MARISHA: Who is?

01:59:56.087 --> 01:59:57.048
LAURA: Greenbeard.

01:59:57.048 --> 01:59:59.155
MARISHA: Fucking druids! Fucking druids!

01:59:59.155 --> 02:00:01.145
ASHLEY: Kill him! Kill him, Keyleth.

02:00:01.145 --> 02:00:02.146
MATT: All right.

02:00:02.146 --> 02:00:03.414
LIAM: Everything just flipped.

02:00:03.414 --> 02:00:05.992
MATT: Now. Percy, you're up.

02:00:05.992 --> 02:00:07.853
SAM: Kill Kevdak.

02:00:07.853 --> 02:00:14.059
TALIESIN: I was going to say, I can't kill Kevdak,
he just healed for--

02:00:14.059 --> 02:00:16.037
MATT: Kevdak was on the cusp.

02:00:16.037 --> 02:00:19.189
ASHLEY: But now he has 70 extra hit points.

02:00:19.189 --> 02:00:20.365
MATT: He does.

02:00:20.365 --> 02:00:26.986
LAURA: He heals 70 extra hit points? Oh, not 70
percent of his hit points? We can still take him,

02:00:26.986 --> 02:00:28.205
we can still take him.

02:00:28.205 --> 02:00:29.373
TALIESIN: Oh, seven hit points.

02:00:29.373 --> 02:00:30.543
ALL: 70.

02:00:30.543 --> 02:00:33.196
TRAVIS: 140. We have to hit him for 140.

02:00:33.196 --> 02:00:34.825
TALIESIN: He healed him 70 hit points. Is he still
raging, though?

02:00:34.825 --> 02:00:39.423
MATT: Yeah. He continues to rage if he's taken
damage since the last round. He's taken a lot of

02:00:39.423 --> 02:00:40.580
damage.

02:00:40.580 --> 02:00:45.000
MARISHA: We've got to get those fucking
gauntlets.

02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:48.730
LAURA: Don't let him get the gauntlets, Percy!

02:00:48.730 --> 02:00:51.810
MARISHA: Where's the gauntlet, can we see the
gauntlet on the battlefield?

02:00:51.810 --> 02:00:54.010
MATT: It's over here right now, it's on the
ground.

02:00:54.010 --> 02:00:55.730
LIAM: He told somebody to pick it up, but they
didn't do it yet.

02:00:55.730 --> 02:01:07.042
TALIESIN: Okay. No, I can't do that, can I? I look
at the guy next to me, I'm going to take a look--

02:01:07.042 --> 02:01:14.377
oh god. I'm going to take a running jump off the
front of the house.

02:01:14.377 --> 02:01:15.511
SAM: Oh my god.

02:01:15.511 --> 02:01:16.859
TALIESIN: Straight into the--

02:01:16.859 --> 02:01:20.706
LAURA: In the kill box, you're going into the kill
box?

02:01:20.706 --> 02:01:22.470
SAM: You're not fast, you're not a fast person!

02:01:22.470 --> 02:01:24.560
TALIESIN: No, I'm going to jump for the other
house.

02:01:24.560 --> 02:01:27.739
MATT: All right, go ahead and make an acrobatics
check. Oh right, this is a jump, so this would be

02:01:27.739 --> 02:01:28.677
athletics.

02:01:28.677 --> 02:01:31.947
TALIESIN: Is it not an acrobatics, I can't do an
acrobatics, I can't parkour this? My hands are free.

02:01:31.947 --> 02:01:36.363
MATT: I'll say you can make an acrobatics with
disadvantage or an athletics with a single roll.

02:01:36.363 --> 02:01:40.829
Since this is actually the strength of the run,
it's not a big distance, so it's not a huge DC for

02:01:40.829 --> 02:01:42.849
a jump, but it's your call. What do you want to
do?

02:01:42.849 --> 02:01:48.441
TALIESIN: I'll take an athletics. What do you
think, athletics or? Oh, no no. I'll acrobatics it

02:01:48.441 --> 02:01:49.496
with disadvantage.

02:01:49.496 --> 02:01:51.069
MATT: All right. Go for it.

02:01:51.069 --> 02:01:53.723
TALIESIN: Yeah, I. Yeah, no.

02:01:53.723 --> 02:01:54.987
MATT: What'd you roll?

02:01:54.987 --> 02:01:56.773
TALIESIN: I rolled a one.

02:01:56.773 --> 02:02:05.594
MATT: You rolled a one? So, as you leap off the
side, your foot hits the edge of the tile, and the

02:02:05.594 --> 02:02:12.094
blade behind you swings. Which I believe is going
to hit you with a 20. Is that your AC?

02:02:12.094 --> 02:02:13.308
TALIESIN: My AC's 18.

02:02:13.308 --> 02:02:17.609
MATT: 18, yeah. You take seven plus four, 11
points of slashing damage.

02:02:17.609 --> 02:02:18.892
TALIESIN: I'm fine with that.

02:02:18.892 --> 02:02:22.247
MATT: The blow, however, is just enough to throw
you off-kilter, and you go plummeting down into

02:02:22.247 --> 02:02:23.390
the alleyway.

02:02:23.390 --> 02:02:24.400
TALIESIN: Okay.

02:02:24.400 --> 02:02:27.820
MATT: Falling prone. You can use your movement to
get back up, the remainder of your movement, but

02:02:27.820 --> 02:02:31.657
you can't move from there. The fall does deal an
additional five points of bludgeoning damage.

02:02:31.657 --> 02:02:32.781
TALIESIN: Don't care.

02:02:32.781 --> 02:02:40.080
MATT: All right, so you get back up-- You're now
in this alleyway right here facing this line here

02:02:40.080 --> 02:02:41.832
is all you can really see from your perspective.

02:02:41.832 --> 02:02:43.121
TALIESIN: Who can I see from my perspective?

02:02:43.121 --> 02:02:47.888
MATT: You can see Vax, you can see Kevdak, and you
can see this dude here, and an archer, but has

02:02:47.888 --> 02:02:49.397
partial cover because of the--

02:02:49.397 --> 02:02:56.224
TALIESIN: Okay, I'm going to, as a bonus action
I'm going to do a quick heal.

02:02:56.224 --> 02:02:58.193
MATT: Okay. Second Wind?

02:02:58.193 --> 02:03:07.823
TALIESIN: Second Wind. Just to make that go away.
God, that's amazing. 18 back, so, I've got--

02:03:07.823 --> 02:03:09.666
MATT: Second Wind, man.

02:03:09.666 --> 02:03:19.355
TALIESIN: And: ow! I'm going to pull out the big
gun and I'm going to take a nice heavy serious

02:03:19.355 --> 02:03:31.066
look at Kevdak. What am I going to hit him with?
I'm going to take a sharpshooter shot in his face.

02:03:31.066 --> 02:03:34.051
I'm going to go for a headshot with the big gun.

02:03:34.051 --> 02:03:36.533
MATT: A headshot? With the big gun?

02:03:36.533 --> 02:03:38.350
TALIESIN: A headshot. With the big, with
sharpshooter.

02:03:38.350 --> 02:03:39.982
MATT: Right, so you're using the trickshot on
him.

02:03:39.982 --> 02:03:51.559
TALIESIN: Trickshot on sharpshooter. I'm doing a
combo. 23 to hit.

02:03:51.559 --> 02:03:53.045
MATT: That hits.

02:03:53.045 --> 02:03:55.583
TALIESIN: I don't feel good.

02:03:55.583 --> 02:03:59.109
TRAVIS: I have the worst headache right now.

02:03:59.109 --> 02:04:03.188
TALIESIN: I feel really bad right now. I don't
feel happy.

02:04:03.188 --> 02:04:07.739
All right, so that's-- first the
damage.

02:04:07.739 --> 02:04:09.366
MATT: All right.

02:04:09.366 --> 02:04:15.301
TALIESIN: That's 26 points of piercing damage.

02:04:15.301 --> 02:04:18.904
MATT: 26 points of piercing damage, reduced to
half, 13.

02:04:18.904 --> 02:04:26.222
TALIESIN: Plus he has to make a constitution
saving throw against a DC of 19.

02:04:26.222 --> 02:04:31.290
MATT: Constitution, yeah, that's a 23.

02:04:31.290 --> 02:04:34.743
LAURA: Wait, what?

02:04:34.743 --> 02:04:37.451
MARISHA: He just made his constitution save.

02:04:37.451 --> 02:04:40.535
MATT: He's got a high constitution, saving throws,
it's kind of his thing.

02:04:40.535 --> 02:04:43.616
TALIESIN: Reloading, taking another shot. I don't
care, I don't care.

02:04:43.616 --> 02:04:45.434
MATT: Same thing, sharpshooter?

02:04:45.434 --> 02:04:50.078
TALIESIN: Same thing, sharpshooter, I'm going
to--

02:04:50.078 --> 02:04:58.745
MATT: Any other trickshots you're going to use,
or? Deadshot, anything you want to use?

02:04:58.745 --> 02:05:00.827
LAURA: This is heroic death music right now.

02:05:00.827 --> 02:05:02.529
TALIESIN: I hate this music you're playing.

02:05:02.529 --> 02:05:03.749
MATT: I could switch it up, if you want.

02:05:03.749 --> 02:05:04.834
TALIESIN: No no.

02:05:04.834 --> 02:05:06.185
LIAM: Benny Hill?

02:05:06.185 --> 02:05:09.473
TALIESIN: I'm going to drop a grit for advantage,
because--

02:05:09.473 --> 02:05:11.623
MATT: Okay, for deadeye shot?

02:05:11.623 --> 02:05:12.944
TALIESIN: Deadeye with sharpshooter.

02:05:12.944 --> 02:05:14.246
MATT: Go for it.

02:05:14.246 --> 02:05:25.510
TALIESIN: That's good. It can only go up from
there. And we do, all right. That's 19, 26 to hit,

02:05:25.510 --> 02:05:26.434
that hits.

02:05:26.434 --> 02:05:27.594
MATT: With the minus five?

02:05:27.594 --> 02:05:30.227
TALIESIN: Oh, yeah, no, that's with the minus
five, how about that, I rolled a 19.

02:05:30.227 --> 02:05:31.874
MATT: Yeah. Great, yeah, so go ahead and roll
damage on that.

02:05:31.874 --> 02:05:35.676
TALIESIN: Asshole, asshole, that's better.

02:05:35.676 --> 02:05:38.310
LAURA: (laughs) He's saying 'asshole, asshole,
asshole'.

02:05:38.310 --> 02:05:47.932
TALIESIN: That is a seven. So that's 17, 18, 19,
20. 30. 36 points of damage.

02:05:47.932 --> 02:05:49.801
MATT: 36 halved to 18.

02:05:49.801 --> 02:05:56.890
TALIESIN: 18. And that's my two shots so I'm not
reloaded.

02:05:56.890 --> 02:05:59.904
MATT: That's your three attacks. Shot, reloaded,
shot.

02:05:59.904 --> 02:06:10.478
TALIESIN: Shot, reloaded, shot. I'm now going to
burn my action surge.

02:06:10.478 --> 02:06:12.413
MATT: Okay, angry Percy's angry.

02:06:12.413 --> 02:06:19.020
TALIESIN: Can I-- I was going to say, can I burn
that as a run or can I only burn that as an attack?

02:06:19.020 --> 02:06:25.857
MATT: As part of the function, it's like-- You can
use your action as a dash, so you could.

02:06:25.857 --> 02:06:33.776
TALIESIN: I'm going to use my action as a dash to,
oh fuck, there's no way around, is there? Fuck it,

02:06:33.776 --> 02:06:35.882
then, I'm taking another shot.

02:06:35.882 --> 02:06:46.494
MATT: All right, so your fourth attack is a
reload, fifth is an attack. Go for it. Is this

02:06:46.494 --> 02:06:48.195
deadeye as well or just regular?

02:06:48.195 --> 02:06:52.054
TALIESIN: This is sharpshooter as well, no
deadeye.

02:06:52.054 --> 02:06:53.897
MATT: Okay, sharpshooter, go for the shot.

02:06:53.897 --> 02:06:59.149
TALIESIN: 23 to hit.

02:06:59.149 --> 02:07:01.068
MATT: 23 hits.

02:07:01.068 --> 02:07:05.025
TALIESIN: I want to save some grit for some
problems. (raspberry)

02:07:05.025 --> 02:07:06.561
SAM: That's not bad.

02:07:06.561 --> 02:07:07.806
TALIESIN: Yeah it is.

02:07:07.806 --> 02:07:09.174
MARISHA: Wait. Did you roll that?

02:07:09.174 --> 02:07:15.140
TALIESIN: Oh fuck, yeah, thank you! That's the
wrong one. Oh, that's so much better.

02:07:15.140 --> 02:07:17.423
MATT: Hah, you rolled a 20-sider instead of a 12?

02:07:17.423 --> 02:07:18.962
TALIESIN: I can't count, my brain.

02:07:18.962 --> 02:07:22.189
LAURA: We're all breaking.

02:07:22.189 --> 02:07:24.180
MARISHA: I know, we're breaking under pressure.

02:07:24.180 --> 02:07:28.849
TALIESIN: 32 points of damage? 32 points of
damage.

02:07:28.849 --> 02:07:30.796
MATT: 16 points of piercing damage, all right.

02:07:30.796 --> 02:07:31.957
TALIESIN: And a reload.

02:07:31.957 --> 02:07:44.726
MATT: And a reload. That's your turn. Percy is
done, dealing a grand total of 47 points of damage

02:07:44.726 --> 02:07:45.924
in that round.

02:07:45.924 --> 02:07:47.309
(cheering)

02:07:47.309 --> 02:07:48.743
LAURA: That's good!

02:07:48.743 --> 02:07:51.623
SAM: And I did ten, so we're almost back to where
we were.

02:07:51.623 --> 02:07:59.653
MARISHA: Okay, angry at the fact that I'm not doing
much, I'm going to slowly, for flavor, my air

02:07:59.653 --> 02:08:03.198
elemental's going to start burning a little fire,
I'm going to drop my air elemental and I'm going

02:08:03.198 --> 02:08:04.823
to do Firestorm.

02:08:04.823 --> 02:08:07.789
MATT: Okay, Ryan, I need the mini-box that was not
brought.

02:08:07.789 --> 02:08:09.449
ASHLEY: (singing) Mini-box.

02:08:09.449 --> 02:08:15.072
LIAM: Borrow the Thordak mini.

02:08:15.072 --> 02:08:24.617
LAURA: What if we all die and the dragons take
over everything?

02:08:24.617 --> 02:08:26.182
LIAM: No. No.

02:08:26.182 --> 02:08:30.383
SAM: You know, it's this kind of intense fun that
you can get in every Loot Crate.

02:08:30.383 --> 02:08:33.327
(laughter)

02:08:33.327 --> 02:08:34.663
MATT: Dammit, Sam.

02:08:34.663 --> 02:08:38.989
SAM: Every month, you'll be on pins and needles to
see what's in this box.

02:08:38.989 --> 02:08:46.483
MATT: All right, for the time being, I'll use this
one here. All right, so Keyleth, you revert back.

02:08:46.483 --> 02:08:47.904
MARISHA: I revert back.

02:08:47.904 --> 02:08:49.703
MATT: We'll use this barmaid for the time being.

02:08:49.703 --> 02:08:51.035
LAURA: You're a barmaid.

02:08:51.035 --> 02:08:52.416
MARISHA: Aw, I've been demoted.

02:08:52.416 --> 02:08:54.737
LIAM: Beers for everybody.

02:08:54.737 --> 02:08:57.225
TALIESIN: We were at the Ren Faire, to be fair.

02:08:57.225 --> 02:09:00.326
MARISHA: This is alternate timeline version.

02:09:00.326 --> 02:09:02.950
MATT: All right, so, Keyleth, what are you doing?
You dropped form.

02:09:02.950 --> 02:09:06.184
MARISHA: I drop form and I'm going to Firestorm
all up in this bitch.

02:09:06.184 --> 02:09:10.966
MATT: Oh, shit. All right. What are you
firestorming, where, what are you doing?

02:09:10.966 --> 02:09:17.882
MARISHA: Seventh level, so it's ten
ten-square-feet. So let's do like--

02:09:17.882 --> 02:09:20.546
MATT: Ten ten-foot cubes.

02:09:20.546 --> 02:09:22.060
MARISHA: Ten ten-foot cubes.

02:09:22.060 --> 02:09:27.625
SAM: Jesus. Well see, those peasants would've died
anyway, it's not me, it's her, she did it.

02:09:27.625 --> 02:09:29.825
MARISHA: I could've gone around them.

02:09:29.825 --> 02:09:33.136
MATT: So how do you want to arrange this here?

02:09:33.136 --> 02:09:37.138
MARISHA: So let's start, can I do ten including
this archer, ten?

02:09:37.138 --> 02:09:43.752
MATT: You can do there, which would burst off the
corner, it would hit Kevdak, the archer, and

02:09:43.752 --> 02:09:45.085
Greenbeard.

02:09:45.085 --> 02:09:46.545
LIAM: Set that tree on fire.

02:09:46.545 --> 02:09:54.267
MARISHA: Actually, as part of the spell I can
choose to not set the tree on fire. So I choose to

02:09:54.267 --> 02:09:55.650
spare the tree.

02:09:55.650 --> 02:09:57.248
MATT: All right, the tree is spared.

02:09:57.248 --> 02:09:58.800
MARISHA: All plant life is spared.

02:09:58.800 --> 02:10:00.974
TALIESIN: Vegan. Sorry.

02:10:00.974 --> 02:10:06.356
MARISHA: I am not a vegan. From there-- is that a
guy, who's that, who's that?

02:10:06.356 --> 02:10:07.874
SAM: They're all baddies.

02:10:07.874 --> 02:10:10.374
LAURA: Everything's bad unless they've got a red
ring around them.

02:10:10.374 --> 02:10:11.654
ASHLEY: Kill 'em, baby, kill 'em.

02:10:11.654 --> 02:10:12.941
LIAM: C'mon, Red!

02:10:12.941 --> 02:10:15.871
LAURA and ASHLEY: C'mon, Kiki!

02:10:15.871 --> 02:10:18.419
MARISHA: Another one there.

02:10:18.419 --> 02:10:26.753
MATT: Okay, so we have there. There. You'd be able
to get one that wouldn't actually hit any of them.

02:10:26.753 --> 02:10:36.632
MARISHA: That's fine, and then that one. Bam. And
then let's go. Can I go four, and then--

02:10:36.632 --> 02:10:42.080
MATT: Six, seven, and that's about all you can
get.

02:10:42.080 --> 02:10:50.273
MARISHA: And that got all of these guys? And then
can I go eight, nine, get this guy--

02:10:50.273 --> 02:11:04.884
MATT: Eight, nine, ten, it wouldn't be able to get
that far over. I mean, you could-- (counting).

02:11:04.884 --> 02:11:06.463
MARISHA: And get all of 'em?

02:11:06.463 --> 02:11:11.393
MATT: You could probably get this section there,
yeah. Because they're all pretty clustered, just barely.

02:11:11.393 --> 02:11:12.594
MARISHA: Okay.

02:11:12.594 --> 02:11:16.035
SAM: And you're doing an "S", which is cool.

02:11:16.035 --> 02:11:17.566
MATT: Go ahead and roll damage on that, Keyleth.

02:11:17.566 --> 02:11:18.711
MARISHA: Zorro!

02:11:18.711 --> 02:11:19.991
LAURA: Sorro!

02:11:19.991 --> 02:11:22.084
MARISHA: Okay, ten-- Sorro! Sorry.

02:11:22.084 --> 02:11:28.008
LAURA: What are you rolling, what is the damage?

02:11:28.008 --> 02:11:33.265
MARISHA: 10d10. Or no, sorry, sorry. 7d10. Wait.
Let me double-check. Let me double-check what it is.

02:11:33.265 --> 02:11:35.273
LAURA: That's a lot. All tens.

02:11:35.273 --> 02:11:41.711
MATT: I'd say you'd be able to get this guy, this
guy you wouldn't be able to, but all the rest of

02:11:41.711 --> 02:11:43.521
these you could. As long as you get over there.

02:11:43.521 --> 02:11:45.455
MARISHA: 7d10. Okay. 7d10.

02:11:45.455 --> 02:11:47.236
MATT: 7d10. Dexterity saving throws, correct,
against your spell DC?

02:11:47.236 --> 02:11:56.793
MARISHA: Uh-huh, which my spell DC is 19. Eight.

02:11:56.793 --> 02:11:58.200
SAM: Oh, some of those are good.

02:11:58.200 --> 02:12:10.258
MARISHA: Some of those are good. Plus six, so
that's 14, 16, 18, 19. Another nine, around

02:12:10.258 --> 02:12:11.422
another-- 29.

02:12:11.422 --> 02:12:13.735
MATT: 29 total points of fire damage?

02:12:13.735 --> 02:12:15.112
MARISHA: 29 total points of fire damage.

02:12:15.112 --> 02:12:25.920
MATT: Hm. Okay. Kevdak takes-- he failed his save,
but he takes half that, so 14 points of fire damage.

02:12:25.920 --> 02:12:29.387
SAM: He's back to where he was before the Heal.

02:12:29.387 --> 02:12:35.425
MATT: Yep. Greenbeard takes the full. 29.

02:12:35.425 --> 02:12:38.772
LAURA: But now he's a tank. Greenbeard's an earth
elemental.

02:12:38.772 --> 02:12:43.582
MATT: Yeah, Greenbeard's taking earth elemental
damage now. That archer, that archer burns up,

02:12:43.582 --> 02:12:46.558
archer screams in pain as it incinerates from the
Firestorm.

02:12:46.558 --> 02:12:47.943
SAM: Wait, somebody died?

02:12:47.943 --> 02:12:49.108
LAURA: An archer died!

02:12:49.108 --> 02:12:50.530
SAM: Oh, thank god.

02:12:50.530 --> 02:13:02.299
MATT: That bladestorm there takes 29 damage. That
guy there, they all take 29 damage. That druid fails.

02:13:02.299 --> 02:13:06.401
TALIESIN: Are they on fire now too?

02:13:06.401 --> 02:13:09.494
LAURA: They're all burning to death slowly.

02:13:09.494 --> 02:13:20.748
MATT: 29 damage there. That druid and the rest of
them, fail, success, fail with a one, fail. Fail

02:13:20.748 --> 02:13:25.071
with another one. Okay, so 29, all righty.

02:13:25.071 --> 02:13:30.535
LIAM: While the entire square sets on fire, Vax
quietly and quickly falls a little deeper.

02:13:30.535 --> 02:13:33.799
ASHLEY: Falls a little deeper in what?

02:13:33.799 --> 02:13:35.066
LIAM: In love.

02:13:35.066 --> 02:13:37.954
LAURA and ASHLEY: Oh. Aww!

02:13:37.954 --> 02:13:40.882
MATT: All right, cool. All righty.

02:13:40.882 --> 02:13:43.318
MARISHA: I light Vax's fire in the meantime.

02:13:43.318 --> 02:13:45.985
MATT: So. That finishes your turn with a
Firestorm?

02:13:45.985 --> 02:13:51.461
MARISHA: No it does not, I'm going to use a bonus
action to do Grasping Vine.

02:13:51.461 --> 02:13:55.373
MATT: Too high-level, you can't do it, Grasping
Vine's a 4th-level spell. You can only do up to a

02:13:55.373 --> 02:13:57.629
second level as a bonus.

02:13:57.629 --> 02:13:59.696
SAM: Can you use your bonus action to heal?

02:13:59.696 --> 02:14:05.373
MARISHA: I could do a bonus action to heal
somebody. Who's down really bad, can I see Pike?

02:14:05.373 --> 02:14:08.523
MATT: You can't see Pike right now, Pike is out of
the room.

02:14:08.523 --> 02:14:11.098
LAURA: Can you see me up in the air?

02:14:11.098 --> 02:14:12.716
MARISHA: Are you rough? Have you taken some
damage?

02:14:12.716 --> 02:14:14.521
LAURA: Can you see me in the air?

02:14:14.521 --> 02:14:17.247
MARISHA: Can I see Vex flying off into the
distance?

02:14:17.247 --> 02:14:19.827
MATT: Currently, roll a perception check.

02:14:19.827 --> 02:14:24.436
MARISHA: Not great, 14.

02:14:24.436 --> 02:14:27.657
MATT: Nope. You do not see Vex, you have no idea
where she is right now, you just saw her.

02:14:27.657 --> 02:14:32.937
MARISHA: I see, I can't hurt him anymore, I see
Scanlan, that's all I can really see?

02:14:32.937 --> 02:14:36.269
MATT: Scanlan you can see over there, but even
then he's too far away for a Healing Word, I think.

02:14:36.269 --> 02:14:38.127
MARISHA: That's it, that's my turn.

02:14:38.127 --> 02:14:39.620
SAM: Well, kill Kevdak, then.

02:14:39.620 --> 02:14:40.952
MATT: Pike, you're up.

02:14:40.952 --> 02:14:47.317
ASHLEY: All right, so I'm going to look at the three
around me, one of them fell off the roof, so

02:14:47.317 --> 02:14:48.851
there's only three there, right?

02:14:48.851 --> 02:14:53.453
MATT: Correct, there are three, ah. There are five
there total, actually.

02:14:53.453 --> 02:14:54.941
ASHLEY: Well, one of them fell the roof.

02:14:54.941 --> 02:14:56.575
LIAM: You accidentally knocked one off the roof,
Matt, five minutes ago.

02:14:56.575 --> 02:14:58.004
MATT: That's good to know.

02:14:58.004 --> 02:14:59.202
ASHLEY: There's how many there?

02:14:59.202 --> 02:15:00.335
MATT: There's four of them there.

02:15:00.335 --> 02:15:02.019
LIAM: He's drunk, fell asleep.

02:15:02.019 --> 02:15:03.472
MATT: No, it's fine.

02:15:03.472 --> 02:15:06.295
ASHLEY: I'm going to tell them.

02:15:06.295 --> 02:15:08.125
LAURA: I'm a barbarian.

02:15:08.125 --> 02:15:09.910
ASHLEY: I'm a barbarian.

02:15:09.910 --> 02:15:11.570
MATT: There we go. That'll work.

02:15:11.570 --> 02:15:21.562
ASHLEY: I'm going to look at them and I am going
to Command all four of them to attack each other.

02:15:21.562 --> 02:15:26.319
At fourth level.

02:15:26.319 --> 02:15:29.441
LIAM: And they're all by their allies so they
should get advantage on each other.

02:15:29.441 --> 02:15:45.274
MATT: Well, technically it doesn't work that way.
All right. All right, so. What's the DC on that?

02:15:45.274 --> 02:15:48.969
MATT and SAM: Spell DC.

02:15:48.969 --> 02:15:50.632
ASHLEY: 16.

02:15:50.632 --> 02:16:00.001
MATT: That's a failure. That's a failure. That's a
20, so that succeeds. That's a failure. So one of

02:16:00.001 --> 02:16:02.681
them succeeded, three of them didn't.

02:16:02.681 --> 02:16:08.017
TRAVIS: What a call. What. A. Call.

02:16:08.017 --> 02:16:09.510
ASHLEY: Well, hopefully, hopefully.

02:16:09.510 --> 02:16:11.199
MATT: So. Does that end your turn?

02:16:11.199 --> 02:16:12.350
ASHLEY: No.

02:16:12.350 --> 02:16:13.785
MATT: Your bonus action still, what are you going
to do?

02:16:13.785 --> 02:16:15.261
SAM: Heal thyself!

02:16:15.261 --> 02:16:21.816
MATT: You do still have Spiritual Weapon up if you
want to use your bonus action to do that.

02:16:21.816 --> 02:16:29.648
ASHLEY: I'm going to use my Spiritual Weapon.

02:16:29.648 --> 02:16:32.700
MATT: The Spiritual Weapon can only move 20 feet.

02:16:32.700 --> 02:16:33.697
ASHLEY: Say again?

02:16:33.697 --> 02:16:35.000
MATT: It can only move 20 feet as a bonus action.

02:16:35.000 --> 02:16:36.423
SAM: Oh, so it can only catch up to him.

02:16:36.423 --> 02:16:43.100
LIAM: Diagonally. Right on his ass. Yeah!

02:16:43.100 --> 02:16:44.731
TALIESIN: It flies over objects, too.

02:16:44.731 --> 02:16:49.912
MATT: But you can't see him right now, you'd have
to move over to have him in view.

02:16:49.912 --> 02:16:53.969
LAURA: And one of them would get an opportunity
now because--

02:16:53.969 --> 02:16:57.708
MATT: One of them would, if you were to try and
dodge past, yeah. What do you want to do?

02:16:57.708 --> 02:16:59.253
ASHLEY: I have to move anyway.

02:16:59.253 --> 02:17:00.797
MATT: It's up to you. What do you want to do?

02:17:00.797 --> 02:17:02.577
ASHLEY: I'm going to try to-- yeah.

02:17:02.577 --> 02:17:05.937
MATT: Go ahead and make an acrobatics check as you
try to tumble in your armor between the legs of

02:17:05.937 --> 02:17:07.361
one of the guys in front of you.

02:17:07.361 --> 02:17:09.926
SAM: Tumbling!

02:17:09.926 --> 02:17:11.391
LAURA: You can do it, Pike!

02:17:11.391 --> 02:17:14.103
ASHLEY: I have inspiration?

02:17:14.103 --> 02:17:18.210
SAM: Oh, you do have inspiration! And you'll need
it, it looks like.

02:17:18.210 --> 02:17:24.924
MATT: Whatever your acrobatics is.

02:17:24.924 --> 02:17:29.427
SAM: With advantage. With triple disadvantage.

02:17:29.427 --> 02:17:34.498
MATT: What is it?

02:17:34.498 --> 02:17:35.702
ASHLEY: 14?

02:17:35.702 --> 02:17:40.021
MATT: 14. Let me double-check here real fast.

02:17:40.021 --> 02:17:43.680
SAM: Oh, he's going to the book for this. For a
somersault!

02:17:43.680 --> 02:17:46.524
TALIESIN: And isn't this guy technically flanked
by enemies now?

02:17:46.524 --> 02:17:48.602
ASHLEY: I mean, I'm not going to somersault, I'm
going to sneak around.

02:17:48.602 --> 02:17:51.990
LIAM: Can't she run under his balls and--

02:17:51.990 --> 02:17:53.809
SAM: It's okay, let the DM DM.

02:17:53.809 --> 02:17:59.367
MATT: Let me deal with it, guys. You don't want to
prod me right now.

02:17:59.367 --> 02:18:02.792
SAM: Chapter three: Somersaults.

02:18:02.792 --> 02:18:05.720
TALIESIN: All that I have and more.

02:18:05.720 --> 02:18:11.142
LIAM: Matt, you do amazing, every week you do
amazing and we're all going to die.

02:18:11.142 --> 02:18:18.459
MATT: Let's see the roll there. All right, so you
manage to barely push past, but you do trigger a

02:18:18.459 --> 02:18:25.063
second attack of opportunity to do so. From that
guy, that big half-orc there that gets in your way.

02:18:25.063 --> 02:18:33.609
So that's two strikes against you, that is a
natural 20. And that's going to be a 13.

02:18:33.609 --> 02:18:35.274
ASHLEY: Okay, well that misses.

02:18:35.274 --> 02:18:43.454
MATT: So that is a pretty low roll, ten points of
slashing damage.

02:18:43.454 --> 02:18:46.948
ASHLEY: I'm alive, I'm alive.

02:18:46.948 --> 02:18:48.608
MATT: What are you at? What're you at?

02:18:48.608 --> 02:18:50.834
ASHLEY: I am at 15.

02:18:50.834 --> 02:19:00.041
MATT: So as you dodge past, get slammed by two
blades, you arc around the corner and they're all

02:19:00.041 --> 02:19:04.456
looking at each other, confused, some of them
affected by this magic they aren't expecting, and

02:19:04.456 --> 02:19:09.846
you rush around and you see in the distance
Kevdak, who's now getting shot a couple times,

02:19:09.846 --> 02:19:15.284
gets set on fire, flames burst up, and he starts
screaming out in pain. As you turn the corner, you

02:19:15.284 --> 02:19:21.777
look over at your Spiritual Weapon, and you can
nudge it forward. Right there, its full movement,

02:19:21.777 --> 02:19:26.494
20 feet. Go ahead and make an attack with your
spell attack modifier. Does not have advantage

02:19:26.494 --> 02:19:28.593
because he is no longer paralyzed.

02:19:28.593 --> 02:19:32.447
ASHLEY: 20.

02:19:32.447 --> 02:19:35.770
MATT: 20 hits. Go ahead and roll damage. So 4d8
plus four.

02:19:35.770 --> 02:19:37.518
SAM: Oh wow, that's good.

02:19:37.518 --> 02:19:39.709
TALIESIN: Oh no, it doesn't fuck around.

02:19:39.709 --> 02:19:40.898
MATT: Still halved, but.

02:19:40.898 --> 02:19:43.255
LIAM: Yeah well. C'mon Sarenrae.

02:19:43.255 --> 02:19:50.162
ASHLEY: Okay. Plus what?

02:19:50.162 --> 02:19:51.737
MATT: Plus four.

02:19:51.737 --> 02:19:53.161
ASHLEY: All right, 24.

02:19:53.161 --> 02:19:55.518
MATT: 24 halved, to 12.

02:19:55.518 --> 02:19:56.835
ASHLEY: Fuck!

02:19:56.835 --> 02:19:58.477
TRAVIS: I know, I forget about it too.

02:19:58.477 --> 02:19:59.721
MATT: Yeah, I know.

02:19:59.721 --> 02:20:00.780
TRAVIS: I forget about it too.

02:20:00.780 --> 02:20:02.922
TALIESIN: This is how we all feel watching you
fight, by the way.

02:20:02.922 --> 02:20:08.366
MATT: So the blade drifts over and in a giant arc
swings down with a resounding shining metallic

02:20:08.366 --> 02:20:14.624
slam. The blade streaks through and cuts this
swath, the blade doesn't stop, it passes through

02:20:14.624 --> 02:20:20.390
and leaves this scar across his body of burned
radiant energy. (grunt of pain) Looks over and

02:20:20.390 --> 02:20:26.741
glares at you from across the open cobblestone of
this marketplace, and you see for a second that

02:20:26.741 --> 02:20:32.082
look that Grog saw that caused him to drop his
weapon, you suddenly feel this quake in your soul.

02:20:32.082 --> 02:20:35.007
This is a powerful entity whose hatred is now bent
on you.

02:20:35.007 --> 02:20:38.104
ASHLEY: I can still move a little bit more, right?
Because that was only--

02:20:38.104 --> 02:20:42.192
MATT: You can if you'd like to. You may take more
attacks of opportunity, though.

02:20:42.192 --> 02:20:43.977
LAURA: What, why?

02:20:43.977 --> 02:20:48.572
MATT: In order for her to move further, you might
move out of combat with the other guys that are there.

02:20:48.572 --> 02:20:50.620
LIAM: But they're all attacking each other.

02:20:50.620 --> 02:20:55.471
MATT: The Command move means on their next turn
they attack each other. Doesn't mean that they're

02:20:55.471 --> 02:20:56.902
charmed or dominated.

02:20:56.902 --> 02:21:02.766
ASHLEY: But how many feet did I move, how many
feet am I able to move anyway?

02:21:02.766 --> 02:21:05.069
MATT: That would've been ten feet, you can move 15
more.

02:21:05.069 --> 02:21:07.146
ASHLEY: Okay, I can move 15 more anyway.

02:21:07.146 --> 02:21:10.399
MATT: Yeah. But you will take two attacks of
opportunity if you move out of range of these two.

02:21:10.399 --> 02:21:14.044
ASHLEY: But wouldn't that be included in the
attacks that I just took? If I can move 15 total?

02:21:14.044 --> 02:21:18.899
MATT: You can move 25 total because of your tiny
feet. You moved ten, you have 15 more feet you can move.

02:21:18.899 --> 02:21:20.418
MARISHA: Your tiny feet.

02:21:20.418 --> 02:21:24.982
ASHLEY: Should I stay? I'll just stay.

02:21:24.982 --> 02:21:26.612
MATT: Okay.

02:21:26.612 --> 02:21:32.632
SAM: You need to heal yourself, dude.

02:21:32.632 --> 02:21:33.978
ASHLEY: I know, I know, I know.

02:21:33.978 --> 02:21:37.270
MATT: Barbarians are going now. This one picks up
the gauntlet and is going to rush over.

02:21:37.270 --> 02:21:39.100
MARISHA: Fuck!

02:21:39.100 --> 02:21:44.324
MATT: And bring it to Kevdak, and he's going to go
ahead and hold it there, as Kevdak takes his arm and--

02:21:44.324 --> 02:21:45.774
MARISHA: Is the arm still in it?

02:21:45.774 --> 02:21:49.974
MATT: The arm is still in it, yeah. And he looks
at it and takes it with his free hand and clutches

02:21:49.974 --> 02:21:53.805
it to his chest. And looks around at the other
ones, says, "We're going." And he--

02:21:53.805 --> 02:21:55.977
TALIESIN: Wait, was he holding a weapon?

02:21:55.977 --> 02:21:58.533
MATT: Yes, he has no weapons, his weapon was
pulled away from him.

02:21:58.533 --> 02:22:00.022
TALIESIN: I thought someone brought him his
weapon.

02:22:00.022 --> 02:22:01.723
MATT: Oh, brought the hammer, he brings up the
hammer as well, but he doesn't--

02:22:01.723 --> 02:22:04.749
TALIESIN: But I thought he was hold--I'm trying,
yeah, no, I'm desperately trying to give a reason

02:22:04.749 --> 02:22:05.905
why this couldn't work.

02:22:05.905 --> 02:22:08.498
MATT: No, he has no weapon on him currently. He
tried to reach for it, but he had no functioning

02:22:08.498 --> 02:22:12.667
arm at the time. He told someone to pick it up, so
someone has your flaming warhammer. These guys

02:22:12.667 --> 02:22:27.076
here are going to move over here. Move over here.
And that one's going to be attacking Pike. Over

02:22:27.076 --> 02:22:38.669
here, that's two attacks on Pike. That's going to
be a 13? And a 14. Rolled really low on that one.

02:22:38.669 --> 02:22:41.008
TALIESIN: Praise Sarenrae, praise Sarenrae.

02:22:41.008 --> 02:22:46.058
MATT: You hear the growl behind you, and without
even turning your head, you slam your shield up

02:22:46.058 --> 02:22:50.086
and deflect one of the blows. Look over your
shoulder and glare at it as another one comes

02:22:50.086 --> 02:22:53.931
down, and this-- you take your mace and swing it
in a wide arc over and slam their blade against

02:22:53.931 --> 02:23:00.460
the stone wall of the side, deflecting the entire
attack. As that's happening, both of those guys go

02:23:00.460 --> 02:23:06.334
forward. Two and a one. Goes up against one of the
peasants and strikes and the peasant ducks out of

02:23:06.334 --> 02:23:08.159
the way and manages to avoid the attacks.

02:23:08.159 --> 02:23:09.304
LAURA: That's good, that's good.

02:23:09.304 --> 02:23:15.175
MATT: This guy here with the giant club goes down
and dodges one of the attacks, the other one does

02:23:15.175 --> 02:23:20.037
come down at 11, yeah, this peasant gets smashed.

02:23:20.037 --> 02:23:21.637
LAURA: Oh no, was that the little kid?

02:23:21.637 --> 02:23:23.247
MATT: No, this was the drunker guy.

02:23:23.247 --> 02:23:25.528
ASHLEY: Well, he didn't feel it.

02:23:25.528 --> 02:23:27.523
TALIESIN: Died happy.

02:23:27.523 --> 02:23:33.812
MATT: All right. That ends their turn, it's the
druids' turn now.

02:23:33.812 --> 02:23:38.310
LAURA: There's so many. They all get to go.

02:23:38.310 --> 02:23:42.094
SAM: That's how they all feel when we attack.

02:23:42.094 --> 02:23:48.853
MATT: This druid here is going to move forward,
seeing you over there, Vax. Reaches out towards

02:23:48.853 --> 02:23:57.704
you as it only has its 4th-level spells and lower
left, because of you, you Counterspell

02:23:57.704 --> 02:24:04.847
motherfucker. It's going to go ahead and cast
Blight on you, Liam. I'm going to need you to go

02:24:04.847 --> 02:24:09.147
ahead and make a constitution saving throw, as the
druid reaches out at you with its hand and says,

02:24:09.147 --> 02:24:17.719
"Kevdak! Inside!" and concentrates, gripping out.
This female goliath, you can see with these thick

02:24:17.719 --> 02:24:22.506
braids in the back of her head, pulled into a
very, very tight braid down to the lower part of

02:24:22.506 --> 02:24:27.756
her back, reaches out and grasps. You feel the
blood begin to pool in parts of your body and your

02:24:27.756 --> 02:24:29.123
veins turn dark around.

02:24:29.123 --> 02:24:30.245
LIAM: Now, constitution save, right?

02:24:30.245 --> 02:24:31.462
MATT: Yes.

02:24:31.462 --> 02:24:36.825
LIAM: This is real bad. What is that? That's
eight.

02:24:36.825 --> 02:24:39.506
SAM: Eight total?

02:24:39.506 --> 02:24:41.320
MATT: Total. All right.

02:24:41.320 --> 02:24:43.284
LIAM: I'm Kate Moss, man.

02:24:43.284 --> 02:24:50.336
TALIESIN: Don't make that face.

02:24:50.336 --> 02:24:52.814
MATT: You take 41 points of necrotic damage.

02:24:52.814 --> 02:24:54.004
MARISHA: Wow.

02:24:54.004 --> 02:25:00.288
MATT: As you feel the energy pulse through your
entire body and it's like all the blood in your

02:25:00.288 --> 02:25:05.501
body momentarily becomes toxic. Your vision blurs
and you feel the dizziness hit you and you almost

02:25:05.501 --> 02:25:07.841
stumble to one knee but you catch yourself against
the wall.

02:25:07.841 --> 02:25:10.761
LIAM: It just halved me.

02:25:10.761 --> 02:25:16.874
MATT: That ends the druids' turn. Now the
blademongers are going to go. All right. These

02:25:16.874 --> 02:25:18.600
guys are all going to attack each other.

02:25:18.600 --> 02:25:19.907
ALL: Yeah!

02:25:19.907 --> 02:25:21.259
MATT: Except for that one.

02:25:21.259 --> 02:25:23.254
TALIESIN: Are they not going to attack him as
well?

02:25:23.254 --> 02:25:26.963
MATT: Well, one of them's going to go ahead and
attack Pike, because it was the one that wasn't

02:25:26.963 --> 02:25:33.324
affected by the Command spell. That's going to be
a 19. No? Okay!

02:25:33.324 --> 02:25:34.518
ASHLEY: Just misses.

02:25:34.518 --> 02:25:39.974
MATT: And a 13. No. Cannot hit this armored little
gnome, who's pushed against the wall, and you're

02:25:39.974 --> 02:25:43.602
deflecting blows and taking hits against the armor
that are denting the front of it, and you're

02:25:43.602 --> 02:25:44.959
grinning and bearing it.

02:25:44.959 --> 02:25:47.416
ASHLEY: I'm growling! Arrr!

02:25:47.416 --> 02:25:49.199
TRAVIS and ASHLEY: Arr!

02:25:49.199 --> 02:25:56.563
MATT: These guys are attacking each other now.
That is seven-- it hits. They can't hit you but

02:25:56.563 --> 02:26:02.428
they can hit each other. Two attacks against that
guy, and then the other guy. Both hit. So the

02:26:02.428 --> 02:26:08.117
first guy takes 14. 24 points of damage.

02:26:08.117 --> 02:26:09.661
SAM: Are you okay?

02:26:09.661 --> 02:26:10.902
ASHLEY: 15.

02:26:10.902 --> 02:26:12.287
SAM: Do you want us to do something?

02:26:12.287 --> 02:26:13.590
ASHLEY: I can. I'm like--

02:26:13.590 --> 02:26:14.910
MARISHA: Just focus on the mission.

02:26:14.910 --> 02:26:16.247
ASHLEY: Focus on the mission at hand.

02:26:16.247 --> 02:26:32.149
MATT: Ends up-- That guy there then also takes 22
points of damage on them. Okay. They start hacking

02:26:32.149 --> 02:26:40.316
into each other with their blades suddenly, trying
to figure out what's happening. And technically

02:26:40.316 --> 02:26:43.793
another barbarian strikes, so the third one who
actually missed you? That would've been an attack

02:26:43.793 --> 02:26:50.263
against its own guy, because that was the one that
didn't hit, so he would've been-- Once again

02:26:50.263 --> 02:26:55.253
against this guy. So he deals an additional 13
points of damage against one of the other ones.

02:26:55.253 --> 02:27:05.193
Okay. Got you. So that finishes their turn there.
So these guys here are going to move around the

02:27:05.193 --> 02:27:12.700
fire, this guy's going to move up here.

02:27:12.700 --> 02:27:15.572
LIAM: Everyone's at disadvantage with me, just a
reminder.

02:27:15.572 --> 02:27:23.450
MATT: Yeah. This guy here is going to go ahead and
move one, two, three. And then using Greenbeard,

02:27:23.450 --> 02:27:32.016
who reaches out and grabs him with his elemental
arm and alley-oops him up onto the roof. With the

02:27:32.016 --> 02:27:33.434
acrobatics roll. Rolls a one.

02:27:33.434 --> 02:27:35.723
ASHLEY: He dies!

02:27:35.723 --> 02:27:39.760
MATT: This guy gets slammed into the side and
falls back to the ground, missing his turn.

02:27:39.760 --> 02:27:42.294
LAURA: Falls right back down like some other loser
that I know of.

02:27:42.294 --> 02:27:47.890
MATT: Yeah, (laughs). Greenbeard miscalculates and
actually slams him against the wall. And then the

02:27:47.890 --> 02:27:54.652
goliath sort of slides down. Takes four points of
bludgeoning damage from that.

02:27:54.652 --> 02:27:56.711
(laughter)

02:27:56.711 --> 02:28:06.430
MATT: All righty. And that guy there is going to
go ahead and strike at the child.

02:28:06.430 --> 02:28:07.509
LAURA: No!

02:28:07.509 --> 02:28:13.312
MATT: A three. And 14.

02:28:13.312 --> 02:28:15.066
MARISHA: Shifty kid, c'mon.

02:28:15.066 --> 02:28:17.079
SAM: He's a little weasel, he's a little weasel.

02:28:17.079 --> 02:28:22.630
MATT: No, he's going to hit the kid.

02:28:22.630 --> 02:28:25.749
LAURA: He's a scrapper, he's dodgy. No!

02:28:25.749 --> 02:28:28.126
MATT: Kid gets cleaved.

02:28:28.126 --> 02:28:31.502
LAURA: We didn't save anybody and we killed
ourselves.

02:28:31.502 --> 02:28:34.389
ASHLEY: If we kill everybody, maybe I can raise
him.

02:28:34.389 --> 02:28:42.512
MATT: They're now trying to find a way to draw you
out. They're taking turns doing this, keeping, as

02:28:42.512 --> 02:28:48.526
each person they strike down they look about the
rooftops again for more of you. That's going to go

02:28:48.526 --> 02:28:57.397
ahead, and these guys here are going to go ahead
and start swarming over towards the front. This

02:28:57.397 --> 02:29:07.661
guy here (counting) can't quite get to you, Vax.
This guy here, seeing Percy jump down, is going to

02:29:07.661 --> 02:29:15.249
go ahead and jump down to meet you from behind.
See if he makes his. He fails on a two. He falls

02:29:15.249 --> 02:29:17.117
prone. Takes--

02:29:17.117 --> 02:29:18.891
LIAM: "I'm coming. Whoa!"

02:29:18.891 --> 02:29:21.249
MATT: He takes 12 points of falling damage

02:29:21.249 --> 02:29:23.048
LIAM: "Ah, help."

02:29:23.048 --> 02:29:30.834
MATT: However, he does use the rest of his
movement to stand back up and is going to take two

02:29:30.834 --> 02:29:35.777
swings at you, Percy. That's going to be a 23 to
hit?

02:29:35.777 --> 02:29:42.949
TALIESIN: I'm going to pull my magic shield,
actually, I would have to have a 24 AC for that

02:29:42.949 --> 02:29:44.040
not to hit.

02:29:44.040 --> 02:29:45.031
MATT: Correct.

02:29:45.031 --> 02:29:46.095
TALIESIN: Yeah, no, I'm--

02:29:46.095 --> 02:29:53.839
MATT: Okay. Second one's a natural 20. So the
first strike hits you for 12 points of slashing

02:29:53.839 --> 02:30:00.231
damage. Second strike, double ones on the crit, so
that's four, eight points of slashing damage with

02:30:00.231 --> 02:30:06.641
the second hit. (laughs) I rolled double ones on
his crit, that's really frustrating. You're fine

02:30:06.641 --> 02:30:10.439
with that. All right, that ends their turn, top of
the round, Vex, you're up.

02:30:10.439 --> 02:30:11.423
LAURA: Okay.

02:30:11.423 --> 02:30:15.997
MATT: As you're standing there now, bleeding
profusely, holding the necklace that holds Grog,

02:30:15.997 --> 02:30:18.227
what are you doing?

02:30:18.227 --> 02:30:23.383
LAURA: I'm going to fly over right above Kevdak.

02:30:23.383 --> 02:30:30.887
TRAVIS: How high?

02:30:30.887 --> 02:30:34.023
LAURA: Like a good 50 feet.

02:30:34.023 --> 02:30:37.203
MATT: Yeah, that's 50. All right.

02:30:37.203 --> 02:30:48.571
LAURA: All right. I'm going to
Pokeball Grog right out so he can attack straight

02:30:48.571 --> 02:30:51.659
out of the gate. Just like I would Cannonball
Trinket.

02:30:51.659 --> 02:30:53.256
TRAVIS: And I am willing.

02:30:53.256 --> 02:30:54.756
MATT: All right.

02:30:54.756 --> 02:30:57.029
SAM: Aren't you at death's door?

02:30:57.029 --> 02:30:57.997
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:30:57.997 --> 02:31:00.893
MATT: I'll say essentially because you held your
action last turn, if you wanted to go ahead and

02:31:00.893 --> 02:31:05.243
take your action to do a drop attack on this point
here.

02:31:05.243 --> 02:31:11.173
LAURA: Can this be my bonus, so I'm dropping him
out is the bonus, and then I still can attack? I

02:31:11.173 --> 02:31:15.873
mean, it's only a locket. It's not like it's a
whole move.

02:31:15.873 --> 02:31:17.789
MATT: Yeah, I'd say it's your bonus action to do
it, yeah.

02:31:17.789 --> 02:31:18.824
LAURA: Okay.

02:31:18.824 --> 02:31:27.265
MATT: So, Grog, you were released, falling down to
land on top of Kevdak with the bloodaxe in a

02:31:27.265 --> 02:31:28.515
downward arc.

02:31:28.515 --> 02:31:30.073
TRAVIS: And a big windup as we're coming down.

02:31:30.073 --> 02:31:31.473
MATT: Go ahead and roll an attack.

02:31:31.473 --> 02:31:32.976
TRAVIS: Any chance I can make this reckless?

02:31:32.976 --> 02:31:34.326
MATT: Yeah.

02:31:34.326 --> 02:31:38.004
LAURA: No! Then they all get advantages against
you again.

02:31:38.004 --> 02:31:39.250
MATT: Up to you.

02:31:39.250 --> 02:31:46.995
TRAVIS: Oh, thank god for that. Natural. 20. Look
at it. The first one was a one.

02:31:46.995 --> 02:31:48.263
ASHLEY: Fuck you!

02:31:48.263 --> 02:31:53.578
MATT: Ones and twenties, man, you got to stop
this. And that's why he did reckless.

02:31:53.578 --> 02:31:57.740
(screaming and cheering)

02:31:57.740 --> 02:32:00.176
MATT: All right, so go ahead and roll damage on
this.

02:32:00.176 --> 02:32:01.829
ASHLEY: Get 'im, Grog.

02:32:01.829 --> 02:32:05.218
LAURA: Does that mean he gets the three 12s
again?

02:32:05.218 --> 02:32:09.333
MATT: With the Brutal Critical at this level, how
many extra dice is it for you?

02:32:09.333 --> 02:32:14.353
TRAVIS: Brutal Critical is one additional damage
die during critical hits.

02:32:14.353 --> 02:32:17.689
MATT: But then that's gone up since you leveled
previously.

02:32:17.689 --> 02:32:18.866
TRAVIS: That's true.

02:32:18.866 --> 02:32:24.206
MATT: So you are now at, I believe-- so Brutal
Critical, yeah, 13 increases to two. So you roll

02:32:24.206 --> 02:32:29.314
an additional 2d12 on the attack. So roll 1d12
plus, you're not raging anymore, because you spent

02:32:29.314 --> 02:32:30.344
the last round.

02:32:30.344 --> 02:32:31.711
TRAVIS: That's right, that's three.

02:32:31.711 --> 02:32:32.980
MATT: All right, so plus three.

02:32:32.980 --> 02:32:34.174
TRAVIS: So ten.

02:32:34.174 --> 02:32:37.218
MATT: Ten. Plus two more d12s.

02:32:37.218 --> 02:32:45.368
TRAVIS: 12. So that's 22. And a ten. For a 32.

02:32:45.368 --> 02:32:47.181
LAURA: And then double that?

02:32:47.181 --> 02:32:50.670
His crits don't get double?

02:32:50.695 --> 02:32:52.703
MATT: You only double the first roll.

02:32:52.703 --> 02:32:54.786
TRAVIS: Yeah, double the first, right. Which was
ten, so 20, so 42.

02:32:54.786 --> 02:32:58.040
MATT: 42, brings it to 21 damage.

02:32:58.040 --> 02:32:59.714
How do you want to do this?

02:32:59.714 --> 02:33:04.569
(screaming and cheering)

02:33:04.569 --> 02:33:05.687
MARISHA: It worked!

02:33:05.687 --> 02:33:07.002
LIAM: Poetic justice!

02:33:07.002 --> 02:33:14.573
MATT: As the shadow fires from the necklace as she
holds it aloft, bleeding and shaking, you appear,

02:33:14.573 --> 02:33:22.012
and dive down in silence. The square coming
towards you, as Kevdak, clutching in the one

02:33:22.012 --> 02:33:26.415
nearly ruined arm, the other arm that you
bisected, is turning the corner, about to open the

02:33:26.415 --> 02:33:31.671
door to dive into the house to avoid it, looks up
just in time to see you streaking down.

02:33:31.671 --> 02:33:32.901
What do you do?

02:33:32.901 --> 02:33:39.497
TRAVIS: I say: For Strongjaw! And I sink the axe
right into his neck and part him perfectly down

02:33:39.497 --> 02:33:40.986
the middle.

02:33:40.986 --> 02:33:47.759
MATT: With the sheer force of the blow, the weight
behind it, and the intent, the axe hits him right

02:33:47.759 --> 02:33:52.381
in the side of the neck, cleaves off part of his
ear, shaves off part of his skin here, exposing

02:33:52.381 --> 02:33:58.068
the jawbone, hits here, breaks the clavicle, tears
through, and every single rib is destroyed. It

02:33:58.068 --> 02:34:02.773
cuts right through the center of this giant body
until it gets to about the midsection where it

02:34:02.773 --> 02:34:11.798
catches, finally. The upper torso splits open and
covers you with gore, however, you still impact,

02:34:11.798 --> 02:34:14.709
not raging.

02:34:14.709 --> 02:34:16.201
TRAVIS: Yep. Nope.

02:34:16.201 --> 02:34:17.482
MATT: You take--

02:34:17.482 --> 02:34:18.691
SAM: He's going to die.

02:34:18.691 --> 02:34:22.750
TRAVIS: Don't care.

02:34:22.750 --> 02:34:28.370
MATT: 25 points of fall damage from the impact.

02:34:28.370 --> 02:34:33.927
TRAVIS: That will put me unconscious and 21 points
under.

02:34:33.927 --> 02:34:40.018
MATT: And 21 points under. You have that barbarian
ability-- Would that be part of this?

02:34:40.018 --> 02:34:41.442
TRAVIS: I have Relentless Rage.

02:34:41.442 --> 02:34:46.793
MATT: If you drop to zero hit points while raging,
you're not raging. So yeah. As you shout, the

02:34:46.793 --> 02:34:53.861
blow, in a very Superman-versus-Doomsday way,
cleaves him in half, and as you slam into the

02:34:53.861 --> 02:34:59.255
ground, you pull the axe free as your shattered
legbones give under and you fall to the ground.

02:34:59.255 --> 02:35:05.365
You smile as you see his form crumple, and then
you (impact) face-first into the ground before him.

02:35:05.365 --> 02:35:16.151
LAURA: Who's next? Oh, I'm still going. It's still
my turn!

02:35:16.151 --> 02:35:27.372
MATT: It's still your turn. You watch as every
single Herd member in the entire open square gasps

02:35:27.372 --> 02:35:32.995
at this whole sight. They all turn hearing you
scream "For Strongjaw" and see this happen. As

02:35:32.995 --> 02:35:39.073
Kevdak's body slumps to the ground, it shrinks
back down to its average size, and you crumple to

02:35:39.073 --> 02:35:43.617
the ground, smiling, and fall next to him. And
everyone takes a moment of breathless silence.

02:35:43.617 --> 02:35:45.193
What are you doing, Vex?

02:35:45.193 --> 02:35:46.563
LAURA: Oh my god.

02:35:46.563 --> 02:35:47.903
SAM: Wait, are you dead, Grog?

02:35:47.903 --> 02:35:49.492
LAURA and LIAM: He's unconscious.

02:35:49.492 --> 02:35:56.600
LAURA: I mean, my only option to heal him is to
land and touch him.

02:35:56.600 --> 02:36:00.207
SAM: He's surrounded by baddies.

02:36:00.207 --> 02:36:05.032
LAURA: Well. Fuck it, I'm going to land and touch
Grog.

02:36:05.032 --> 02:36:08.448
MATT: Okay. What's the speed of the broom?

02:36:08.448 --> 02:36:10.541
LAURA: I don't know.

02:36:10.541 --> 02:36:12.540
MATT: It should say on the broom how fast you can
move on it.

02:36:12.540 --> 02:36:15.902
LAURA: Do I have that somewhere?

02:36:15.902 --> 02:36:21.524
SAM: You know, in your broom chapter.

02:36:21.524 --> 02:36:23.228
MATT: Here we go, I'll find it for you.

02:36:23.228 --> 02:36:25.452
LAURA: Oh wait, wait.

02:36:25.452 --> 02:36:42.041
MATT: Just a moment, guys. Broom of Flying. Speed
of 50 feet. So you moved from over here, which

02:36:42.041 --> 02:36:45.901
would have put you-- it's about 50 to get there.
So you could use your action to dash with it,

02:36:45.901 --> 02:36:47.572
you'd land, that's all you could do.

02:36:47.572 --> 02:36:56.655
LAURA: I couldn't do anything else? Okay. Then I
guess I'm going to stay where I am and-- Jeez. Can

02:36:56.655 --> 02:37:01.906
I hold my action? I'm going to hold my action
until--

02:37:01.906 --> 02:37:08.289
MATT: Yeah, it's an action to feed a potion to
anyone.

02:37:08.289 --> 02:37:09.452
LAURA: Yeah.

02:37:09.452 --> 02:37:12.143
MATT: What are you going to do, Vex? Hurry up.

02:37:12.143 --> 02:37:16.385
LAURA: I'm going to hold my action until Grog is
healed.

02:37:16.385 --> 02:37:19.920
MATT: Okay. Okay.

02:37:19.920 --> 02:37:23.493
LAURA: And I-- can I shout anything?

02:37:23.493 --> 02:37:24.816
MATT: If you want to.

02:37:24.816 --> 02:37:30.349
LAURA: I'm going to shout, witness Grog Strongjaw,
and bend the knee!

02:37:30.349 --> 02:37:34.309
ASHLEY: It's great, it's great, it's great.

02:37:34.309 --> 02:37:37.835
MATT: Make an intimidation check.

02:37:37.835 --> 02:37:41.581
LAURA: Natural 20!

02:37:41.581 --> 02:37:43.962
(yelling and cheering)

02:37:43.962 --> 02:37:45.604
MATT: Don't hit the table, I was going to go
inspect it.

02:37:45.604 --> 02:37:47.610
LAURA: No, I hit, I hit, but it was, it was a 20,
I swear.

02:37:47.610 --> 02:37:52.155
MATT: No, I trust you guys. I trust you guys.

02:37:52.155 --> 02:37:54.159
SAM: It's all ones and twenties.

02:37:54.159 --> 02:37:58.284
We have these two-sided dice. Just a one and
a 20.

02:37:58.284 --> 02:38:02.819
MATT: This is going to be an interesting night to
explain to the internet, guys. All right.

02:38:02.819 --> 02:38:06.726
LIAM: You opened it up to the dice, and the dice
decided.

02:38:06.726 --> 02:38:08.387
ASHLEY: We witnessed, we witnessed.

02:38:08.387 --> 02:38:22.489
MATT: Okay. So. At this point in time, you watch
as Greenbeard's form shrinks down and shifts back

02:38:22.489 --> 02:38:32.442
into his goliath form, still busted, he's looking
down at the destroyed, crumpled body of Kevdak,

02:38:32.442 --> 02:38:39.269
and you there on the ground as well, looking up at
you above and hovering. He looks over at the other

02:38:39.269 --> 02:38:46.017
goliaths nearby here that are rushing in, and they
all step out and backwards, inspecting this body.

02:38:46.017 --> 02:38:53.447
There's a pause, a moment of pause. But they've
all paid attention to what you said. That ends

02:38:53.447 --> 02:38:56.653
your turn. It is now the archers' turn.

02:38:56.653 --> 02:38:58.648
LIAM: Not me right after Vex?

02:38:58.648 --> 02:38:59.975
MATT: I'm sorry, you're up next.

02:38:59.975 --> 02:39:03.523
LIAM: Yeah. I'm going to use disengage to back a
little bit away from them, I'm going to scrabble

02:39:03.523 --> 02:39:09.091
up the wall-- where's the light, no-- I want to go
up by Keyleth.

02:39:09.091 --> 02:39:10.769
TRAVIS: You're pointing at the screen.

02:39:10.769 --> 02:39:12.021
MATT: So you move around.

02:39:12.021 --> 02:39:18.067
LIAM: I'm not the first one to do that. And pass
her, I want to jump down and land in front of Grog.

02:39:18.067 --> 02:39:21.058
MATT: Okay. So you run past there?

02:39:21.058 --> 02:39:26.878
LIAM: And jump in front of him, between him and--
not Greenbeard, between Grog and everyone over there.

02:39:26.878 --> 02:39:30.349
MATT: Okay, so you'd be leaping, technically onto
the body of Kevdak is what you'd be doing.

02:39:30.349 --> 02:39:31.438
LIAM: That's fine.

02:39:31.438 --> 02:39:32.560
MARISHA: Squish.

02:39:32.560 --> 02:39:38.415
MATT: So you land onto Kevdak's form, very angry
slash, I'll say for the purposes of this you're

02:39:38.415 --> 02:39:41.864
there, because Kevdak's body is way too big right
now to put on the field.

02:39:41.864 --> 02:39:43.633
LAURA: But we are so going to loot that.

02:39:43.633 --> 02:39:45.108
MARISHA: So going to loot that shit.

02:39:45.108 --> 02:39:46.310
MATT: All right, you land.

02:39:46.310 --> 02:39:47.532
LAURA: If we survive this.

02:39:47.532 --> 02:39:49.433
MATT: With your hasted movement, make an
acrobatics check for the jump.

02:39:49.433 --> 02:39:52.184
LIAM: That's fine. 25.

02:39:52.184 --> 02:39:57.984
MATT: Yeah, you scale up, run, leap, land there,
feet sinking into the body.

02:39:57.984 --> 02:40:05.914
LIAM: And I land on him and I say, Kevdak has
fallen. Will you let Strongjaw rise? And I hold my

02:40:05.914 --> 02:40:07.821
action to attack if they come at me.

02:40:07.821 --> 02:40:21.559
MATT: Okay. It's the archers' turn. This archer
has its arrow trained on you and is going to hold

02:40:21.559 --> 02:40:29.679
its action. This archer here is going to move up
to see what's happened, dashing to look out and

02:40:29.679 --> 02:40:33.346
see what happened, doesn't get its turn. This
archer here, who's now moved, moves over to this

02:40:33.346 --> 02:40:38.696
side with its arrow trained on you as well. It's
also going to hold its action. And they're all

02:40:38.696 --> 02:40:42.346
looking at each other at this Mexican standoff
moment where they're all poised and ready.

02:40:42.346 --> 02:40:47.059
Everyone's holding their actions right now. It
would be Kevdak's turn, Scanlan, you're up.

02:40:47.059 --> 02:40:55.356
SAM: I'm pretty far. I'm going to jump down off
the roof and move towards Grog.

02:40:55.356 --> 02:41:07.902
MATT: Okay, so you run down. Okay. The guy who was
up against you has looked over and is not paying

02:41:07.902 --> 02:41:10.079
attention at this moment. Make a stealth check.

02:41:10.079 --> 02:41:13.334
SAM: Oh. Stealth check. 13.

02:41:13.334 --> 02:41:19.133
MATT: 13. As you rush down the thing, he looks
over, looks at you and goes, "Hey. Hey!" And can't

02:41:19.133 --> 02:41:25.461
even catch you, you're too fast. Make an
acrobatics check as you leap off the roof.

02:41:25.461 --> 02:41:28.195
SAM: 19.

02:41:28.195 --> 02:41:36.377
MATT: 19. You gnomish three-point-land in this
square. You're right next to Pike now, you've

02:41:36.377 --> 02:41:40.592
landed next to her. As you're around the corner
now, you see Scanlan (impact) right next to you.

02:41:40.592 --> 02:41:41.993
ASHLEY: Hi!

02:41:41.993 --> 02:41:44.854
MATT: You've got about 15 more feet you can move
if you wanted to.

02:41:44.854 --> 02:41:53.556
SAM: Move 15 feet? Okay. I will, can I, I can't
take her hand and walk too, she can't move right now.

02:41:53.556 --> 02:41:56.184
MATT: No, not at the moment.

02:41:56.184 --> 02:41:57.432
SAM: Okay, well I'm going to continue to walk.

02:41:57.432 --> 02:42:00.137
MATT: I mean, I could say if you wanted to, you
could move half your movement and take her with you.

02:42:00.137 --> 02:42:02.905
SAM: Okay, I'll do that. I'll take her with me.

02:42:02.905 --> 02:42:04.635
MATT: Okay, you take her hand.

02:42:04.635 --> 02:42:14.949
SAM: I'm going to use Healing Word, oh shit, what
just happened?

02:42:14.949 --> 02:42:17.959
MATT: You and Pike move there, holding each
other's hand.

02:42:17.959 --> 02:42:25.897
SAM: Okay. I'm going to use Healing Word on Grog,
and I'm just going to start chanting, Strongjaw!

02:42:25.897 --> 02:42:28.229
Strongjaw! Strongjaw!

02:42:28.229 --> 02:42:31.754
ALL: Strongjaw! Strongjaw! Strongjaw! Strongjaw!

02:42:31.754 --> 02:42:33.508
SAM: Communicate that as a Healing Word.

02:42:33.508 --> 02:42:37.519
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and roll the heal on that. I
also want you to go ahead and make a persuasion check.

02:42:37.519 --> 02:42:39.389
SAM: Me?

02:42:39.389 --> 02:42:40.815
MATT: Yeah.

02:42:40.815 --> 02:42:44.996
SAM: Heal is eight points. What's that do?

02:42:44.996 --> 02:42:46.894
MATT: So you go to zero, and then eight.

02:42:46.894 --> 02:42:48.166
TRAVIS: Okay.

02:42:48.166 --> 02:42:50.949
SAM: And then persuasion check?

02:42:50.949 --> 02:42:52.243
MATT: Yes.

02:42:52.243 --> 02:42:57.245
SAM: Well, I mean, come on.

02:42:57.245 --> 02:42:58.402
TALIESIN: I know.

02:42:58.402 --> 02:42:59.729
SAM: That's 23.

02:42:59.729 --> 02:43:03.364
MATT: Okay. Good to know. Finishes your turn,
Scanlan--?

02:43:03.364 --> 02:43:04.900
SAM: No, I have an action still.

02:43:04.900 --> 02:43:06.207
MATT: Yes, you do.

02:43:06.207 --> 02:43:18.045
SAM: So I will cast Bigby's Hand and lift Grog up
30 feet like a fucking god.

02:43:18.045 --> 02:43:19.590
(laughter)

02:43:19.590 --> 02:43:26.314
SAM: If he's willing.

02:43:26.314 --> 02:43:36.863
MATT: I will say for the purposes of this, because
I want to do this, this is ridiculous.

02:43:36.863 --> 02:43:42.763
SAM: Oh, I had to cast that at level six, by the
way.

02:43:42.763 --> 02:43:45.268
LIAM: Is it full palm-up, or is it Barcalounger
style?

02:43:45.268 --> 02:43:48.399
MARISHA: Is it like a chair?

02:43:48.399 --> 02:43:52.313
SAM: You know what, because he's the god
and the hand is subservient, it's the back of the

02:43:52.313 --> 02:43:55.000
hand like this. It's a dainty lift.

02:43:55.000 --> 02:43:56.704
(laughter)

02:43:56.704 --> 02:44:00.808
MATT: I will say Grog is now currently being held
aloft right there.

02:44:00.808 --> 02:44:02.281
MARISHA: Nice!

02:44:02.281 --> 02:44:09.437
MATT: As the hand is clutching Grog Strongjaw,
lifting him up into the air, you're conscious now

02:44:09.437 --> 02:44:14.070
as the hand's holding you on its back and you get
up from one knee. Grog, it's your turn.

02:44:14.070 --> 02:44:15.143
LIAM: Pinkie's up?

02:44:15.143 --> 02:44:17.563
SAM: Pinkie's up. Tea-time.

02:44:17.563 --> 02:44:31.013
TRAVIS: My herd. Hear me. Fallen is your mighty
leader Kevdak, the very goliath swine who would

02:44:31.013 --> 02:44:38.479
have domesticated you like a common household cat,
who would have made you bend a knee to a mere

02:44:38.479 --> 02:44:44.567
dragon. I show you this. And I reach into the Bag
of Holding and I pull out one of the dragon's

02:44:44.567 --> 02:44:48.110
teeth that is still in there and I toss it into
the middle of the square.

02:44:48.110 --> 02:44:59.005
MATT: Clatters to the ground at the feet of one of
the nearby bladestorms. It stops at his foot. He

02:44:59.005 --> 02:45:01.204
looks at it, picks it up.

02:45:01.204 --> 02:45:09.329
TRAVIS: I would tell you that under the correct
rule, and a return of power to this Herd,

02:45:09.329 --> 02:45:20.799
dragons would bend a knee to the Herd of the
Storm. Where is Zanror?

02:45:20.799 --> 02:45:28.529
MATT: They all look at each other and Greenbeard
hobbles out, still wounded and hurt, into the

02:45:28.529 --> 02:45:30.071
center of this area.

02:45:30.071 --> 02:45:31.891
SAM: Does he have an actual name or is that just
his name?

02:45:31.891 --> 02:45:32.892
MATT: Greenbeard's his name.

02:45:32.892 --> 02:45:34.171
SAM: Oh, great.

02:45:34.171 --> 02:45:47.786
MATT: Steps out into the middle, looking up at
you. "Strongjaw. You stand above us all. In a way."

02:45:47.786 --> 02:45:50.231
(laughter)

02:45:50.231 --> 02:45:59.874
MATT: "Claiming dominion over a herd that you fell
to and left behind for years. Though you struck

02:45:59.874 --> 02:46:08.943
"down Kevdak, what do you think makes you aligned
with the interests of our people?"

02:46:08.943 --> 02:46:19.904
TRAVIS: Oh, you mistake me, Seer of the Herd. I do
not mean to lead this herd, but rather to empower

02:46:19.904 --> 02:46:29.357
you to more powerful game. I'm here to inspire
your aspirations. Never would I ask you to bend

02:46:29.357 --> 02:46:37.429
the knee. Only would I ask you to live and fight
and perhaps die in the most beautiful death you

02:46:37.429 --> 02:46:47.146
can possibly attain. Join me and my fellows.
Come to our aid when I call. And with that, we

02:46:47.146 --> 02:46:52.806
will chase down dragons, gods, and more.

02:46:52.806 --> 02:46:56.254
MATT: Make a persuasion check with advantage.

02:46:56.254 --> 02:46:57.660
LAURA: Come on, come on, come on.

02:46:57.660 --> 02:46:59.517
MATT: With advantage on that.

02:46:59.517 --> 02:47:04.859
TRAVIS: Fuck. That's only an 11.

02:47:04.859 --> 02:47:06.618
ASHLEY: Can I use War God's Blessing, or?

02:47:06.618 --> 02:47:08.452
MATT: I don't think it works for abilities.

02:47:08.452 --> 02:47:12.751
MARISHA: Can I assist him with a skywrite
'Strongjaw'?

02:47:12.751 --> 02:47:16.369
MATT: (laughs) Bing! Strongjaw.

02:47:16.369 --> 02:47:20.011
MARISHA: I mean a stormcloud above him?

02:47:20.011 --> 02:47:22.325
ASHLEY: Inspo, inspo, inspiration from anywhere?

02:47:22.325 --> 02:47:27.156
MATT: It's a little late for that. It's okay. At
this point Greenbeard sizes you up from a

02:47:27.156 --> 02:47:31.366
distance. Everyone else is waiting for a word, you
can see everyone is hand on the side of their

02:47:31.366 --> 02:47:37.543
weapons looking at each other and there's this
extremely tense air. Greenbeard turns around and

02:47:37.543 --> 02:47:47.741
looks to two of the individuals near the front of
the building and goes, "Bring out Zanror." And the

02:47:47.741 --> 02:47:52.718
two of them go inside the door and close it behind
them. They step inside the building and there's

02:47:52.718 --> 02:47:58.556
this long silence. You wait for 30 seconds.

02:47:58.556 --> 02:48:01.908
LAURA: Can I take a healing potion while they're
inside? I'm up on the thing.

02:48:01.908 --> 02:48:03.899
MATT: You can, yes.

02:48:03.899 --> 02:48:05.387
ASHLEY: Can I heal Grog?

02:48:05.387 --> 02:48:07.215
MATT: Are you going to step up?

02:48:07.215 --> 02:48:08.467
ASHLEY: I can see him.

02:48:08.467 --> 02:48:09.565
MATT: You can see him, yeah.

02:48:09.565 --> 02:48:11.044
ASHLEY: So I'm going to cast Heal on him.

02:48:11.044 --> 02:48:12.362
MATT: You're going to cast Heal?

02:48:12.362 --> 02:48:13.163
ASHLEY: Yeah.

02:48:13.163 --> 02:48:19.550
MATT: As you begin to go for your holy symbol, you
can see two of the warriors behind you twitch for

02:48:19.550 --> 02:48:20.641
their weapons.

02:48:20.641 --> 02:48:28.709
TRAVIS: Hold! It is not necessary. Brothers, look
me in the eye. Has the taste of food lost its

02:48:28.709 --> 02:48:37.991
appeal? Has the zest for life fallen from your
hearts? Living in this domesticated dwelling. I

02:48:37.991 --> 02:48:47.645
promise you this: hear me, and I promise you
adventures and glory that is worthy of this herd.

02:48:47.645 --> 02:48:52.837
MATT: The door slams open from the front of the
Margrave's home. You see as the two individuals

02:48:52.837 --> 02:49:00.117
come out with chains over their shoulders as they
drag out into the center two individuals. You see

02:49:00.117 --> 02:49:07.176
another half-giant goliath man, one that you've
all seen once before on your way to Kraghammer

02:49:07.176 --> 02:49:19.402
months and months ago. Well. Yeah, about. You see
him swollen in the face, bruised, and in shackles,

02:49:19.402 --> 02:49:26.061
dragged out and thrown to the ground. And the
other one holds over his shoulder another chain.

02:49:26.061 --> 02:49:33.599
He pulls out behind him a half-giant woman with
the hair on the sides of her head shaved, one

02:49:33.599 --> 02:49:41.654
single long mane of hair, and it looks like she's
with child. Also in shackles. And she's pushed to

02:49:41.654 --> 02:49:51.741
the ground with Zanror. Zanror looks up and you
can see him closing his eyes like the daylight

02:49:51.741 --> 02:50:02.880
itself is very bright and he probably hasn't seen
light in a period of time. "Strongjaw."

02:50:02.880 --> 02:50:06.237
TRAVIS: Cousin.

02:50:06.313 --> 02:50:11.966
MATT: "Well. This is a surprise."

02:50:11.966 --> 02:50:18.235
TRAVIS: Your face seems a little different.

02:50:18.235 --> 02:50:22.018
MATT: It's at this moment that he looks over and
glances, and can see the body of Kevdak on the

02:50:22.018 --> 02:50:27.703
ground for the first time, and then he goes, "You
did this?"

02:50:27.703 --> 02:50:32.082
TRAVIS: Scanlan. Lower me down.

02:50:32.082 --> 02:50:38.992
SAM: I swoop him down. Do you want to be on the
ground or just above it?

02:50:38.992 --> 02:50:40.178
TRAVIS: On the ground.

02:50:40.178 --> 02:50:47.789
SAM: On the ground. But I release him and I make a
fist that clenches right next to him. Just in case

02:50:47.789 --> 02:50:49.495
anything goes bad.

02:50:49.495 --> 02:50:56.698
MATT: So. As you're brought down to the ground,
Bigby's Hand sets you gently on the cobblestone.

02:50:56.698 --> 02:51:09.772
TRAVIS: I take a few steps forward. Yes. This my
work. A debt fulfilled after many, many years.

02:51:09.772 --> 02:51:31.857
MATT: (sighs) "I fear the Herd's lost its edge.
Priorities. My father had grown docile in this

02:51:31.857 --> 02:51:38.381
"place. But he wouldn't be if whispers hadn't found
his ears." And he looks over at Greenbeard.

02:51:38.381 --> 02:51:47.864
Greenbeard immediately steps back and goes, "Look
at him in shackles. This isn't a warrior, this is

02:51:47.864 --> 02:51:51.772
"a slave. Both of 'em." Spits in their direction.

02:51:51.772 --> 02:52:01.387
TRAVIS: Strange. I would ask, why is he in
shackles? What did Zanror do that would draw this

02:52:01.387 --> 02:52:04.101
sort of ire from the Herd?

02:52:04.101 --> 02:52:09.284
MATT: The one that's holding the chains on Zanror
pulls them a little tighter and Zanror's lifted up

02:52:09.284 --> 02:52:13.430
a little bit off of his leaning-forward position,
he's now on his knees and his arms are pulled up,

02:52:13.430 --> 02:52:27.781
in towards his torso. And Greenbeard looks back
towards you. "This skyshield here spoke against his

02:52:27.781 --> 02:52:34.285
"father. He was attempting some sort of a mutiny.
But we quelled that right quick. Gave him time to

02:52:34.285 --> 02:52:42.980
"think about it. His father was deciding what to do
with this traitor. And his next of kin. You,

02:52:42.980 --> 02:52:50.010
"however, seemingly stopped his trial, so I think
it's only fitting that you do the honors of

02:52:50.010 --> 02:52:57.404
"finishing the job." And you can see as you were
lifted off the ground and everything, you did not

02:52:57.404 --> 02:53:04.894
have your weapon with you, as you were on the
ground, lifted up. Greenbeard steps over and takes

02:53:04.894 --> 02:53:10.420
the bloodaxe from the ground, walks up to you, and
hands it out, and looks over to Zanror.

02:53:10.420 --> 02:53:22.492
TRAVIS: I am sorry, Zanror. But I will make it a
glorious death. Bring me the gauntlets as well.

02:53:22.492 --> 02:53:33.080
MATT: "Let it be." And two of the other
individuals, one of the half-orc individuals looks

02:53:33.080 --> 02:53:37.862
over, hushed, and starts backing away from this,
this is too much for him. There's now this tribal

02:53:37.862 --> 02:53:42.234
tension, this cultural tension that only exists
within the initial Herd and has been only recently

02:53:42.234 --> 02:53:49.974
adopted by the Rivermaw that were absorbed by the
Herd and are still confused by this. Two of the

02:53:49.974 --> 02:53:56.151
goliaths step over and pull and pry out the
somewhat soggy leftover arm of Kevdak.

02:53:56.151 --> 02:53:59.358
LAURA: Kind of like when you're eating lobster, to
get the claw out, yeah.

02:53:59.358 --> 02:54:02.853
LIAM: Shrinks as it leaves.

02:54:02.853 --> 02:54:04.161
MATT: They toss it to the ground before you.

02:54:04.161 --> 02:54:07.473
TRAVIS: I stand. Put on the gauntlets.

02:54:07.473 --> 02:54:10.650
MATT: Kevdak at this point is still being held up
by the chains and says--

02:54:10.650 --> 02:54:12.255
TRAVIS: Zanror.

02:54:12.255 --> 02:54:21.137
MATT: Sorry, Zanror. Thank you. "It was
unbefitting of us all to be living under one of

02:54:21.137 --> 02:54:28.474
"those beasts. Under my rule, we were going to take
back our power as a people."

02:54:28.474 --> 02:54:37.381
TRAVIS: Quiet yourself. I've heard enough. And I
lift the bloodaxe and I say: you are a disgrace to

02:54:37.381 --> 02:54:41.465
this herd and I will return this herd to power.

02:54:41.465 --> 02:54:47.021
And I pivot, and I drive the bloodaxe into
Greenbeard.

02:54:47.021 --> 02:54:49.090
MATT: Oh shit! Roll an attack.

02:54:49.090 --> 02:54:50.776
TALIESIN: Yeah you do, buddy.

02:54:50.776 --> 02:54:51.835
TRAVIS: Reckless?

02:54:51.835 --> 02:54:53.351
MATT: If you want to.

02:54:53.351 --> 02:54:57.568
LAURA: No!

02:54:57.568 --> 02:54:58.898
ASHLEY: Get the fuck out!

02:54:58.898 --> 02:55:01.340
LAURA: It's a fucking natural 20.

02:55:01.340 --> 02:55:02.441
MATT: Roll damage.

02:55:02.441 --> 02:55:04.844
SAM: We're going to have to get these dice
calibrated later.

02:55:04.844 --> 02:55:07.619
LAURA: But why does it only happen when it's a
story element?

02:55:07.619 --> 02:55:08.979
TRAVIS: That's an 11.

02:55:08.979 --> 02:55:11.785
MATT: Watch as next week Critical Role implements
dice cam.

02:55:11.785 --> 02:55:13.187
(laughter)

02:55:13.187 --> 02:55:14.824
MATT: No, that's awesome.

02:55:14.824 --> 02:55:16.320
LAURA: Oh, let me take a picture, I'll take a
picture.

02:55:16.320 --> 02:55:17.408
TRAVIS: So that's 15.

02:55:17.408 --> 02:55:18.349
MATT: All right.

02:55:18.349 --> 02:55:19.563
TRAVIS: And then two more?

02:55:19.563 --> 02:55:20.891
MATT: Two more, yeah.

02:55:20.891 --> 02:55:24.982
TALIESIN: Watch next week as we fail to open the
door to his house for an hour and a half.

02:55:24.982 --> 02:55:29.324
MARISHA: Yeah, yes, can't roll above a five next
week.

02:55:29.324 --> 02:55:30.804
TRAVIS: That's 27. 37.

02:55:30.804 --> 02:55:32.656
MATT: How do you want to do this?

02:55:32.656 --> 02:55:34.038
SAM: Oh, you got it?

02:55:34.038 --> 02:55:36.172
MATT: (laughs) He had taken a shit-ton of damage
in the battle, and was already moving by--

02:55:36.172 --> 02:55:37.495
TALIESIN: Yeah, he was pretty low.

02:55:37.495 --> 02:55:39.178
MATT: He had like 12 more hit points left, so.

02:55:39.178 --> 02:55:43.519
TRAVIS: It seems all the poison came from his
head, so I'll remove that from his body.

02:55:43.519 --> 02:55:50.033
MATT: And with that moment, (swishing), with a
very slick snapping sound, the blade coasts

02:55:50.033 --> 02:55:55.653
through and the neck retreats as the head
continues forward and tumbles to the feet as

02:55:55.653 --> 02:56:01.164
Greenbeard's body takes an instinctual step
backward and then falls, lifeless, in the center

02:56:01.164 --> 02:56:05.758
of the marketplace. All the rest of the Herd moves
for a second, nervously.

02:56:05.758 --> 02:56:12.449
TRAVIS: I spin and I say: do you see? Do you see
what staying in one place does? This is what

02:56:12.449 --> 02:56:20.250
weakness looks like. I would return you to the
wild. I would return you to power. But you will

02:56:20.250 --> 02:56:29.346
have to do it under this goliath's rule. Unchain
Zanror.

02:56:29.346 --> 02:56:32.073
SAM: I point Bigby's Hand like he was too.

02:56:32.073 --> 02:56:34.106
(laughter)

02:56:34.106 --> 02:56:42.659
MATT: As Bigby's hand points to Zanror, the two
that are holding the chains move up and begin to

02:56:42.659 --> 02:56:46.921
unchain them both, taking the shackles off his
hands and the female goliath at his side.

02:56:46.921 --> 02:56:52.433
Eventually he stands up, reaches over and puts his
arm around her and says, "I am sorry, Worra."

02:56:52.433 --> 02:56:54.765
TRAVIS: Worra.

02:56:54.765 --> 02:57:03.295
MATT: Worra. She stands and goes, "Do not be
sorry. It seems we've been delivered from our

02:57:03.295 --> 02:57:06.121
"judgment." She looks up towards you. You don't
recognize her.

02:57:06.121 --> 02:57:07.987
TRAVIS: I don't.

02:57:07.987 --> 02:57:11.445
MATT: She's not from the original Herd.

02:57:11.445 --> 02:57:19.197
TRAVIS: Zanror, she is quite a beauty.
Congratulations.

02:57:19.197 --> 02:57:31.401
MATT: "You saved us narrowly being executed,
Grog." And he stands up and gets to the front of

02:57:31.401 --> 02:57:46.212
all the rest of the Herd there. "Call forth the
rest of our people. We do not leave this town yet.

02:57:46.212 --> 02:58:00.279
"We claim Westruun home for one more night. For it
is tomorrow at dawn, we slam our blades against

02:58:00.279 --> 02:58:02.327
"the hide of a dragon."

02:58:02.327 --> 02:58:19.870
TRAVIS: No. This is honor. This is pride. This is
a life worth living.

02:58:19.870 --> 02:58:29.341
MATT: "Will you join us in this glory and pride,
fair cousin Grog? You have proven yourself worthy

02:58:29.341 --> 02:58:35.536
"of life and respect and the might of the Herd of
Storms."

02:58:35.536 --> 02:58:38.745
TRAVIS: How many do you number?

02:58:38.745 --> 02:58:43.239
MATT: He looks about and takes in the mental math
of all the people that were killed.

02:58:43.239 --> 02:58:47.049
MARISHA: Yeah, we didn't kill that many.

02:58:47.049 --> 02:58:54.779
MATT: I know, you took a few down. "We'd stand,
between the people that were loyal to me and my

02:58:54.779 --> 02:59:00.928
"father, a good 43 men strong."

02:59:00.928 --> 02:59:06.899
TRAVIS: More than we need. And I grab my earpiece
and I go, (meekly) thoughts?

02:59:06.899 --> 02:59:08.824
(laughter)

02:59:08.824 --> 02:59:13.795
SAM: I mean, we have a busy day tomorrow already,
I don't know if we should add dragons to it.

02:59:13.795 --> 02:59:15.903
TALIESIN: We're hunting another dragon.

02:59:15.903 --> 02:59:18.253
SAM: Just say yes, we can always leave in the dead
of night.

02:59:18.253 --> 02:59:27.125
TRAVIS: All right. All this bloodshed is giving me
a terrible itch in my ear. We shall stay with you

02:59:27.125 --> 02:59:34.332
and tomorrow we will bathe in the blood of a
dragon.

02:59:34.332 --> 02:59:38.841
MATT: He steps forward to you now, there's a
slight limp to his walk, but there's too much

02:59:38.841 --> 02:59:43.827
pride for him to show it as he tenses and reaches
out his hands to you and clasps it in his own,

02:59:43.827 --> 02:59:47.133
Beastmaster-style, holding onto it.

02:59:47.133 --> 02:59:48.819
TRAVIS: Yeah, strength and honor!

02:59:48.819 --> 02:59:52.900
MATT: "For the dragons, it shall be."

02:59:52.900 --> 02:59:54.681
TRAVIS: It shall be.

02:59:54.681 --> 03:00:03.430
MATT: He releases the grasp. "Let them walk
amongst us as brethren. Come. We have much

03:00:03.430 --> 03:00:11.436
"preparation to do." And he goes back to Worra and
limps into her arms, and she takes him up and it's

03:00:11.436 --> 03:00:15.947
her strength now lifting him on his feet. And the
two begin to make their way across the rest of the

03:00:15.947 --> 03:00:21.945
center of town. All the rest of them take their
weapons and they relax, and they still keep a very

03:00:21.945 --> 03:00:27.893
wary eye of you. The words have been said and
there is still this tenuous truce, but they're

03:00:27.893 --> 03:00:32.075
still coming off the cusp of adrenaline, warfare,
and the slaughtering of their previous leader.

03:00:32.075 --> 03:00:36.340
However, they are going along with the words that
were spoken, and there is a look of general fear

03:00:36.340 --> 03:00:42.401
and respect in their eyes, guarded as it may be.
What do you guys want to do?

03:00:42.401 --> 03:00:47.133
LIAM: I would like to sever the remaining gristle
away from his arm that's holding the gauntlet on.

03:00:47.133 --> 03:00:51.915
MATT: The gauntlets have been retrieved. And given
to Grog, yeah.

03:00:51.915 --> 03:00:55.426
LIAM: Then I would like to loot Greenbeard's
body.

03:00:55.426 --> 03:00:59.574
TRAVIS: Could you do me a favor? Could you butcher
me a skull of Kevdak, please?

03:00:59.574 --> 03:01:00.722
LIAM: Yeah.

03:01:00.722 --> 03:01:03.833
LAURA: Yeah, yeah. I'm going to land.

03:01:03.833 --> 03:01:06.751
MATT: You're going to land, all right.

03:01:06.751 --> 03:01:08.549
LAURA: And I'm going to call Trinket out.

03:01:08.549 --> 03:01:12.146
MATT: Trinket, who's been hiding in the back room
there.

03:01:12.146 --> 03:01:14.138
LAURA: Because things happened so fast for him!

03:01:14.138 --> 03:01:15.227
MATT: They did happen.

03:01:15.227 --> 03:01:16.652
LAURA: And there were really strong people!

03:01:16.652 --> 03:01:20.273
ASHLEY: And I got to go over and heal, yeah.
Already healed him.

03:01:20.273 --> 03:01:23.627
SAM: I'm going to go over-- are there any remains
of the little boy?

03:01:23.627 --> 03:01:25.172
MATT: Yeah.

03:01:25.172 --> 03:01:33.575
SAM: Do you have anything that can heal the little
boy or bring him back somehow, Pike? Key?

03:01:33.575 --> 03:01:34.606
Anything?

03:01:34.606 --> 03:01:38.448
MARISHA: I go and check the little boy. How bad is
he? Is he beyond the point of return?

03:01:38.448 --> 03:01:39.855
MATT: He's done.

03:01:39.855 --> 03:01:41.099
ASHLEY: Could I--

03:01:41.099 --> 03:01:42.993
SAM: Resurrect him or something?

03:01:42.993 --> 03:01:46.031
ASHLEY: I have Raise Dead.

03:01:46.031 --> 03:01:47.430
MATT: Do you?

03:01:47.430 --> 03:01:49.890
LAURA: Does it turn him into a zombie, or does
it--

03:01:49.890 --> 03:01:51.556
MATT: No, it just raises him from the dead.

03:01:51.556 --> 03:01:53.039
LAURA: Okay, yeah, do that.

03:01:53.039 --> 03:01:57.722
ASHLEY: Okay. I'll go over to the little boy and
see if I can--

03:01:57.722 --> 03:02:02.475
MATT: Okay, this will take a while. All right. So,
as the rest of herd move on, following Zanror,

03:02:02.475 --> 03:02:06.242
they begin to separate to gather the rest of the
herd throughout the town. A few stay behind, keeping watch--

03:02:06.242 --> 03:02:09.624
MARISHA: I'll assist Pike in any way that I can.

03:02:09.624 --> 03:02:10.530
MATT: Okay.

03:02:10.530 --> 03:02:12.164
TALIESIN: I'm going to sit and fix my gun.

03:02:12.164 --> 03:02:19.665
MATT: It's going to cost-- 500 gold are consumed
by the casting of this spell as part of the--

03:02:19.665 --> 03:02:21.309
LAURA: I'll help.

03:02:21.309 --> 03:02:32.314
MATT: Okay. Takes an hour. So, as you guys take
this time, this is a short rest for those of you

03:02:32.314 --> 03:02:37.479
who aren't part of this ritual. You complete the
ritual. Go ahead and make a religion check.

03:02:37.479 --> 03:02:42.994
LAURA: Hey, you already boxed up your stuff.

03:02:42.994 --> 03:02:45.914
MATT: She was like, I'm done, I'm out. Peace.

03:02:45.914 --> 03:02:47.362
ASHLEY: 20?

03:02:47.362 --> 03:02:48.990
MATT: d20, add your religion.

03:02:48.990 --> 03:02:50.992
LAURA: That's good.

03:02:50.992 --> 03:02:57.556
ASHLEY: 24.

03:02:57.556 --> 03:03:01.598
MATT: Okay. Vex, you said you wanted to help. What
did you want to help with the ritual on?

03:03:01.598 --> 03:03:03.532
MARISHA: No, I said I wanted to help.

03:03:03.532 --> 03:03:05.524
LAURA: She was assisting. I was helping with the
money.

03:03:05.524 --> 03:03:10.117
MATT: Right, sorry, helping with the money. How
are you aiding with the ritual?

03:03:10.117 --> 03:03:12.398
MARISHA: What? How am I aiding with the ritual?

03:03:12.398 --> 03:03:13.399
MATT: Yes.

03:03:13.399 --> 03:03:14.500
MARISHA: What were you doing?

03:03:14.500 --> 03:03:17.415
MATT: Well, she was casting-- she was preparing
the ritual, preparing seals and taking out the

03:03:17.415 --> 03:03:22.907
components and praying to Sarenrae and speaking
the rites, which channel through her in Celestial

03:03:22.907 --> 03:03:26.038
language. Although she doesn't understand
Celestial, she speaks it through as part of the

03:03:26.038 --> 03:03:27.158
spell, almost like--

03:03:27.158 --> 03:03:28.343
TALIESIN: I speak Celestial.

03:03:28.343 --> 03:03:31.323
MARISHA: I also speak-- no, I speak Primordial. I
keep getting that confused.

03:03:31.323 --> 03:03:33.256
MATT: Yep. How are you aiding in this?

03:03:33.256 --> 03:03:42.265
MARISHA: Can place my hand on his chest and place
my other hand on the ground and try and use

03:03:42.265 --> 03:03:45.685
natural healing to assist?

03:03:45.685 --> 03:03:51.458
MATT: Sure. Go ahead and make a straight wisdom
roll.

03:03:51.458 --> 03:03:54.353
MARISHA: Natural one.

03:03:54.353 --> 03:03:55.486
MATT: Okay.

03:03:55.486 --> 03:03:56.744
TALIESIN: Can I assist?

03:03:56.744 --> 03:03:57.868
MATT: How would you like to assist?

03:03:57.868 --> 03:04:00.738
TALIESIN: I would like to come over and start
listening to the chanting that she's doing in

03:04:00.738 --> 03:04:04.771
Celestial and harmonize and bring a voice to it
since I can actually speak Celestial.

03:04:04.771 --> 03:04:06.768
MATT: Roll a performance check.

03:04:06.768 --> 03:04:08.062
SAM: Performance.

03:04:08.062 --> 03:04:09.332
LAURA: That's lovely.

03:04:09.332 --> 03:04:12.120
TALIESIN: 21.

03:04:12.120 --> 03:04:18.749
MATT: All right. As you finish the ritual, both
the voices of Pike and Percy begin to harmonize

03:04:18.749 --> 03:04:24.862
across these various refrains in a language that,
especially when spoken in this rhythmic,

03:04:24.862 --> 03:04:29.166
ritualistic way, it seems to almost create a third
voice. And then you hear, clearly, there is a

03:04:29.166 --> 03:04:32.840
third voice harmonizing with them that you don't
know where it's coming from.

03:04:32.840 --> 03:04:38.536
SAM: It's me. I'm off here in the corner. (sings
scat)

03:04:38.536 --> 03:04:45.942
MATT: As the beautiful musical tones of the
singing come to a close, your holy symbol, the

03:04:45.942 --> 03:04:53.504
glow fades, and a moment passes before you hear
the soft coughing of the child's throaty

03:04:53.504 --> 03:05:01.419
expulsion, himself taking in his next breath of
air. He sits up, cradling his head.

03:05:01.419 --> 03:05:03.368
"What happened?"

03:05:03.368 --> 03:05:07.711
MARISHA: It's okay. I dump a Cure Wounds in him
now.

03:05:07.711 --> 03:05:09.656
MATT: It's okay!

03:05:09.656 --> 03:05:11.538
(laughter)

03:05:11.538 --> 03:05:14.485
MARISHA: Not a potion! I cast Cure Wounds.

03:05:14.485 --> 03:05:15.780
MATT: Okay, okay.

03:05:15.780 --> 03:05:17.051
TALIESIN: Take it, take it!

03:05:17.051 --> 03:05:18.885
MATT: He's like, (choking sounds).

03:05:18.885 --> 03:05:25.335
LAURA: I cast Grasping Vine and lift him up by the
neck.

03:05:25.335 --> 03:05:26.657
LIAM: Shot right in the chest.

03:05:26.657 --> 03:05:32.317
TALIESIN: Six years of Celestial, and when are you
ever going to use it? It finally pays off.

03:05:32.317 --> 03:05:36.187
ASHLEY: Thanks for helping, Percy.

03:05:36.187 --> 03:05:37.698
TALIESIN: That was lovely, thank you.

03:05:37.698 --> 03:05:42.200
MATT: All right. So the child is brought back to
life, healed, confused, dazed, but not really

03:05:42.200 --> 03:05:44.505
understanding the circumstances around him, just
happy to--

03:05:44.505 --> 03:05:46.176
MARISHA: He heals 24 hit points.

03:05:46.176 --> 03:05:50.796
MATT: Yeah, he's good to go. His wounds close, the
dried blood's still there, but he seems to be in

03:05:50.796 --> 03:05:55.287
perfect health at the moment, although a little
weak and worse for wear.

03:05:55.287 --> 03:05:56.995
LAURA: Where's your mother, child?

03:05:56.995 --> 03:05:58.789
MATT: "I don't know."

03:05:58.789 --> 03:06:00.450
LAURA: Was she here in the square with you?

03:06:00.450 --> 03:06:08.153
MATT: "No, everything went by so fast. They tried
to pull them out, but they found me and pulled me

03:06:08.153 --> 03:06:13.610
"out and brought me here. That's all. There was a
fight and a lot of yelling. That's all I remember."

03:06:13.610 --> 03:06:15.139
ASHLEY: Where do you live?

03:06:15.139 --> 03:06:17.735
MATT: "Up by the temples."

03:06:17.735 --> 03:06:25.889
LAURA: Okay. Well, we'll help you find your
family. And maybe while we're there we can see if

03:06:25.889 --> 03:06:27.971
your grandfather's around.

03:06:27.971 --> 03:06:36.171
MATT: He smiles a little bit. You can still see
the dried blood streaks across his face, but you

03:06:36.171 --> 03:06:40.650
can see past that to the smile that peeks through
beneath his dirty face.

03:06:40.650 --> 03:06:43.833
LAURA: I lift him up and put him on Trinket so we
can start walking.

03:06:43.833 --> 03:06:48.749
MATT: Okay. He laughs and Trinket licks him and
takes some of that off and he is excited to be

03:06:48.749 --> 03:06:53.592
grasping something, although he slides a couple
times. You can see he's weak from the remnants of

03:06:53.592 --> 03:06:54.884
the resurrection spell.

03:06:54.884 --> 03:06:56.352
MARISHA: I give him a boost.

03:06:56.352 --> 03:06:59.142
MATT: Okay. Anybody else doing anything for the
short rest?

03:06:59.142 --> 03:07:07.064
TRAVIS: I would like to not only remove Kevdak's
head, just the upper part, no jaw, just the skull,

03:07:07.064 --> 03:07:14.241
and I would like to use the bloodaxe to flay the
skin around the bear tattoo off.

03:07:14.241 --> 03:07:18.704
LAURA: Is there anything else to loot off of
Kevdak?

03:07:18.704 --> 03:07:22.942
MATT: I mean, there is the bloodaxe, there is
the--

03:07:22.942 --> 03:07:24.165
LAURA: Gauntlets?

03:07:24.165 --> 03:07:30.666
MATT: The gauntlets, and he has four plus-one
enchanted javelins that he did not have an

03:07:30.666 --> 03:07:32.281
opportunity to use this battle.

03:07:32.281 --> 03:07:35.186
LAURA: (sings) Bag of Holding!

03:07:35.186 --> 03:07:37.216
LIAM: I already called Greenbeard.

03:07:37.216 --> 03:07:45.045
TRAVIS: I'll take the plus-one javelins. And I'd
like to put the flayed skin in your refrigerated bag.

03:07:45.045 --> 03:07:48.425
MATT: So mark that, mark down in your refrigerated
bag, flayed bear tattoo of Kevdak.

03:07:48.425 --> 03:07:50.287
LAURA: Flayed bear tattoo. Got it.

03:07:50.287 --> 03:07:56.152
MATT: That's disgusting. General leather armor,
quarterstaff. You do find one potion of greater

03:07:56.152 --> 03:07:58.013
healing he did not have the opportunity to try.

03:07:58.013 --> 03:08:00.768
LAURA: Nice. I'm putting that down.

03:08:00.768 --> 03:08:02.342
MATT: That's all he has on him.

03:08:02.342 --> 03:08:07.888
LIAM: Okay. I'm going to spend the rest of the
time that they did that ritual gathering up the

03:08:07.888 --> 03:08:09.509
bodies, the remains.

03:08:09.509 --> 03:08:10.846
TALIESIN: I'm going to fix my gun.

03:08:10.846 --> 03:08:12.492
MATT: Okay. Make a tinkering check.

03:08:12.492 --> 03:08:19.413
TALIESIN: Just barely. By one point. Did not
break.

03:08:19.413 --> 03:08:21.742
MATT: Good. All right.

03:08:21.742 --> 03:08:22.958
LIAM: I'm going to start a fire--

03:08:22.958 --> 03:08:25.499
MATT: There's already a fire going.

03:08:25.499 --> 03:08:26.404
LIAM: Is it?

03:08:26.404 --> 03:08:29.910
MATT: Well, it's slower-burning embers now. One of
the barricades that had been set fire by the

03:08:29.910 --> 03:08:30.960
Fireball earlier.

03:08:30.960 --> 03:08:33.645
LIAM: I'll stoke it, and then put the bodies on.

03:08:33.645 --> 03:08:39.442
MATT: Okay, so you take the bodies of the dead
villagers that had been lost in the battle and the

03:08:39.442 --> 03:08:44.723
handful of the other combatants that had fallen,
and you throw them onto the fire and it crackles

03:08:44.723 --> 03:08:49.175
and burns over time. The smell of burning bodies
fills the space around it for a while.

03:08:49.175 --> 03:08:55.715
TALIESIN: We have a house to procure some items
from. And a conversation to have with Zanror at

03:08:55.715 --> 03:08:56.712
some point.

03:08:56.712 --> 03:08:58.289
SAM: What time of day is it now?

03:08:58.289 --> 03:09:02.076
TRAVIS: Are there any other goliaths in the square
that are lingering?

03:09:02.076 --> 03:09:06.679
MATT: There are three lingering that are keeping
an eye.

03:09:06.679 --> 03:09:09.581
TRAVIS: Can I walk over to one?

03:09:09.581 --> 03:09:11.511
MATT: Sure.

03:09:11.511 --> 03:09:25.295
TRAVIS: Tonight we prepare for an incredible
battle. Go. Release any meager prisoners you may

03:09:25.295 --> 03:09:28.742
have kept. They will do nothing for our fight.

03:09:28.742 --> 03:09:40.163
MATT: "Very well. These two stay, though. No
offense, but you did just kill one of my friends

03:09:40.163 --> 03:09:41.771
"naught but an hour ago."

03:09:41.771 --> 03:09:44.366
TRAVIS: I did. And your claim is fair.

03:09:44.366 --> 03:09:45.772
TALIESIN: These two?

03:09:45.772 --> 03:09:47.482
LAURA: Who's these two?

03:09:47.482 --> 03:09:51.526
MATT: There were three Herd members that were
keeping an eye--

03:09:51.526 --> 03:09:52.714
LAURA: Oh, okay.

03:09:52.714 --> 03:09:59.140
MATT: Two of them are goliaths. One of them is
human. The human and the other goliath stay

03:09:59.140 --> 03:10:04.936
behind. The one you talked to walks off and seems
to be following through on what you told him to do.

03:10:04.936 --> 03:10:10.314
TALIESIN: Is it Lord Zanror, by the way? I may
request an audience with Lord Zanror at some

03:10:10.314 --> 03:10:12.305
point. With your supervision.

03:10:12.305 --> 03:10:14.915
TRAVIS: Yeah. Have at it.

03:10:14.915 --> 03:10:17.155
MATT: Now Thunderlord Zanror.

03:10:17.155 --> 03:10:22.889
TRAVIS: Yeah, Thunderlord! I say that in my head.

03:10:22.889 --> 03:10:26.621
SAM: We have Pike's dad to find, we've got a house
to loot--

03:10:26.621 --> 03:10:29.252
MARISHA: We've got a child to deliver home.

03:10:29.252 --> 03:10:31.553
MATT: Did you want to look over the items you
found on Kevdak?

03:10:31.553 --> 03:10:33.300
TRAVIS: Oh fucking shit, yes, may I please?

03:10:33.300 --> 03:10:40.088
TALIESIN: And a unique opportunity to maybe really
fuck up a dragon. If we want to be smart.

03:10:40.088 --> 03:10:42.799
MATT: There's your bloodaxe. And there's your
Titanstone Knuckles.

03:10:42.799 --> 03:10:46.289
LAURA: (laughs) Bowing down like he's been
knighted.

03:10:46.289 --> 03:10:53.555
TALIESIN: Hm? We have a dragon who's going to go
pick up a giant package of whatever we give him.

03:10:53.555 --> 03:10:55.091
LAURA: Oh shit, you're right.

03:10:55.091 --> 03:10:58.112
TALIESIN: We could make some interesting decisions
on what's in that box.

03:10:58.112 --> 03:11:02.959
MARISHA: That is an interesting point.

03:11:02.959 --> 03:11:05.405
LAURA: I mean, do we have to stay in the square,
or are we allowed to?

03:11:05.405 --> 03:11:08.843
MATT: No. Doesn't seem to be anything holding you
there other than the ritual that was done. When

03:11:08.843 --> 03:11:13.852
the ritual's completed, you're welcome to go about
what you're doing. At which point you do see as

03:11:13.852 --> 03:11:19.883
time has passed, a few people start poking through
windows, who apparently were either hiding in some

03:11:19.883 --> 03:11:26.240
of these buildings, and see you guys and check out
and then go back into hiding again. The town still

03:11:26.240 --> 03:11:30.518
has people living throughout it. Many of them stay
hidden whenever things move in their vicinity.

03:11:30.518 --> 03:11:31.870
LAURA: Okay.

03:11:31.870 --> 03:11:33.908
MATT: So.

03:11:33.908 --> 03:11:38.765
SAM: What's our thing? Do we want to achieve
anything else tonight or just rest?

03:11:38.765 --> 03:11:43.719
LAURA: I feel like we should return this little
boy to his family. And see if we can

03:11:43.719 --> 03:11:45.244
find your grandpa.

03:11:45.244 --> 03:11:46.964
LIAM: In the short term, we should be able to walk
freely, though.

03:11:46.964 --> 03:11:56.190
MATT: All right. So, as you guys gather
yourselves, partially rested and breathing a sigh

03:11:56.190 --> 03:12:01.541
of relief at the not horrible circumstance that
nearly transpired there thanks to the luck of the

03:12:01.541 --> 03:12:03.046
gods in a lot of cases.

03:12:03.046 --> 03:12:05.268
LAURA: I can't believe we're not all dead.

03:12:05.268 --> 03:12:11.499
MATT: You make your way northward through
Westruun, toward the temple district, small child

03:12:11.499 --> 03:12:13.053
at your side with the intent--

03:12:13.053 --> 03:12:14.064
LAURA: On Trinket.

03:12:14.064 --> 03:12:22.359
MATT: On Trinket by your side. And possibly to
prepare for whatever the Herd has in store for

03:12:22.359 --> 03:12:26.914
dawn. And with that, we'll finish tonight's game.

03:12:26.914 --> 03:12:30.667
MARISHA: Now we're going to have to have another
huge conversation.

03:12:30.667 --> 03:12:38.347
LAURA: We didn't die! I seriously thought we were
all going to die. When he got healed and

03:12:38.347 --> 03:12:40.088
everything was running--

03:12:40.088 --> 03:12:43.611
TRAVIS: Yup. Yup. I was like, we might as well
make it cool, because we're dead.

03:12:43.611 --> 03:12:47.869
LIAM: We had it, then it flipped and it was gone.
And then we snaked it outta the fire.

03:12:47.869 --> 03:12:49.560
MARISHA: But we had them on the run!

03:12:49.560 --> 03:12:52.041
MATT: He, by the way, on that Hold Person, that
Cutting Words/Hold Person.

03:12:52.041 --> 03:12:54.471
Like, that's exactly what that--

03:12:54.471 --> 03:12:59.398
TRAVIS: Dude. Yes. Give it up for the fucking
bard. Who has an article in Dear Vox Machina.

03:12:59.398 --> 03:13:01.218
SAM: Oh yeah, appearing tomorrow.

03:13:01.218 --> 03:13:06.334
MATT: Yeah, no. Kevdak hadn't used his action
surge yet.

03:13:06.334 --> 03:13:08.286
MARISHA: What was that?

03:13:08.286 --> 03:13:10.255
MATT: Kevdak hadn't used his action surge yet.

03:13:10.255 --> 03:13:12.096
SAM: Action surge? What does that do?

03:13:12.096 --> 03:13:13.652
MATT: Multi, it's what he does.

03:13:13.652 --> 03:13:15.656
TALIESIN: What I do, where he can take an extra
action.

03:13:15.656 --> 03:13:17.679
MATT: He can do four attacks in one round with the
bloodaxe.

03:13:17.679 --> 03:13:19.084
SAM: Did he ever get to attack?

03:13:19.084 --> 03:13:23.441
MATT: No. Couldn't make his save. His arms were
gone by the time he came around.

03:13:23.441 --> 03:13:27.855
LAURA: Oh my god, getting his arms off him,
brilliant.

03:13:27.855 --> 03:13:34.545
MATT: Plus, he had four more superiority die and
the riposte ability. So he could--

03:13:34.545 --> 03:13:36.011
TRAVIS: What is riposte?

03:13:36.011 --> 03:13:39.113
MATT: When a creature misses him with a melee
attack, he can use one of his superiority die to

03:13:39.113 --> 03:13:42.415
do a reaction attack as well. So he could in
theory get five attacks in one round.

03:13:42.415 --> 03:13:47.907
TRAVIS: Oh. Holy shit. That's that half-fighter
side, right?

03:13:47.907 --> 03:13:49.399
TALIESIN: That's sexy.

03:13:49.399 --> 03:13:53.086
MATT: Yeah, that Hold Person really changed the
dynamic really fast.

03:13:53.086 --> 03:13:57.766
LIAM: We had a very heated discussion over the
earring in that 30 seconds, let me tell you.

03:13:57.766 --> 03:14:00.191
TALIESIN: Well, we had that whole long walk. That
was the theory.

03:14:00.191 --> 03:14:03.644
ASHLEY: I think that was the most stressful game
I've ever played.

03:14:03.644 --> 03:14:05.062
LAURA: This was incredibly stressful.

03:14:05.062 --> 03:14:07.890
SAM: Pike almost died, Grog died.

03:14:07.890 --> 03:14:15.371
TALIESIN: I was about to be toast. Two more hits
from that guy and that would've been the end of me.

03:14:15.371 --> 03:14:17.342
TRAVIS: That was fucking amazing.

03:14:17.342 --> 03:14:20.048
MARISHA: That was a three-hour battle. We did
nothing but fight.

03:14:20.048 --> 03:14:23.879
MATT: And honestly, mucking it up with the archers
helped too, because they were all about to start

03:14:23.879 --> 03:14:25.954
focus-firing on whoever was visible.

03:14:25.954 --> 03:14:30.448
LAURA: Yeah. So I'm glad we split them up. Getting
Grog out.

03:14:30.448 --> 03:14:36.201
MATT: Getting Grog out was key. If you hadn't
pulled him out and taken all those attacks of

03:14:36.201 --> 03:14:40.345
opportunity? You would be gone. They weren't going
to stop when you hit zero.

03:14:40.345 --> 03:14:41.531
TRAVIS: No no, that would've been it.

03:14:41.531 --> 03:14:43.201
MATT: They were going to cut you up until you were
dead.

03:14:43.201 --> 03:14:44.409
TRAVIS: Yeah. Yep.

03:14:44.409 --> 03:14:45.714
LIAM: Look at that guy.

03:14:45.714 --> 03:14:47.076
MATT: What?

03:14:47.076 --> 03:14:50.361
TRAVIS: I know, look at the face, you saw it too,
didn't you? The shadow of a man that wished he

03:14:50.361 --> 03:14:53.617
could have butchered somebody and didn't quite get
to.

03:14:53.617 --> 03:14:55.349
(laughter)

03:14:55.349 --> 03:14:58.129
TRAVIS: The shadow of Craven Edge lives behind
those eyes.

03:14:58.129 --> 03:15:01.190
MATT: It's okay. Bunch of dudes. You guys have
dragons to deal with.

03:15:01.190 --> 03:15:02.509
LAURA: Oh god.

03:15:02.509 --> 03:15:08.974
MATT: All right, well, guys, thank you very much
for watching. Thanks again for Loot Crate for

03:15:08.974 --> 03:15:10.906
being awesome and being our sponsor--

03:15:10.906 --> 03:15:12.206
ALL: Thank you, Loot Crate!

03:15:12.206 --> 03:15:14.452
MATT: If-- I dunno, if he's still around. Is our
guest still around?

03:15:14.452 --> 03:15:15.927
LAURA: Is he?

03:15:15.927 --> 03:15:18.074
SAM: No, there's no way.

03:15:18.074 --> 03:15:22.960
TRAVIS: Why don't you mention the Loot Crate link
again?

03:15:22.960 --> 03:15:26.876
SAM: Oh yeah, we should flash up the Loot Crate
link and we'll be tweeting that out later.

03:15:26.876 --> 03:15:31.695
MATT: Yeah, it's ww (stammers), www.Loot
Crate.com/criticalrole.

03:15:31.695 --> 03:15:33.563
SAM: So that's five w's?

03:15:33.563 --> 03:15:38.115
TALIESIN: And the code is "criticalrole", not
"critrole".

03:15:38.115 --> 03:15:41.145
MATT: They didn't coordinate with Wyrmwood.

03:15:41.145 --> 03:15:42.469
LIAM: Missed opportunity.

03:15:42.469 --> 03:15:45.614
TALIESIN: I got Loot Crate for my little brother.
It's his nerd of the month club.

03:15:45.614 --> 03:15:47.712
ASHLEY: It's the best. I have Loot Crate and it's
the best.

03:15:47.712 --> 03:15:50.012
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's a bash. Every time around we're
like, aha!

03:15:50.012 --> 03:15:53.620
MARISHA: I know, it's like a little present to
yourself that you forgot you got.

03:15:53.620 --> 03:16:00.288
TALIESIN: Also, anything I don't want, I put into
a big bin and, at Christmas, I am Santa Claus to

03:16:00.288 --> 03:16:04.558
all the kids on the block. It's intense. They all
want to know what's up with me.

03:16:04.558 --> 03:16:11.679
MATT: That's fantastic. All right. Well, in the
meantime, we'll be back next week to see what this

03:16:11.679 --> 03:16:20.924
next chapter in the Westruun portion of this
adventure holds. Well done, guys. That's the

03:16:20.924 --> 03:16:22.513
largest battlefield I've made so far.

03:16:22.513 --> 03:16:24.463
SAM: That was an amazing battlefield.

03:16:24.463 --> 03:16:26.317
LAURA: Good job, Matthew Mercer.

03:16:26.317 --> 03:16:28.692
MARISHA: Thank you, Dwarven Forge!

03:16:28.692 --> 03:16:31.895
MATT: Is he-- he's not here?

03:16:31.895 --> 03:16:33.936
(groans of disappointment)

03:16:33.936 --> 03:16:38.989
MATT: Well, we had the pleasure of having Patrick
Rothfuss in the office today to watch the game, so

03:16:38.989 --> 03:16:42.792
wherever you are, Patrick, pleasure to meet you,
and maybe we'll drag you--

03:16:42.792 --> 03:16:44.321
ASHLEY: Big fans, big fans.

03:16:44.321 --> 03:16:50.261
MATT: Maybe we'll drag you on the show sometime.
Next time you're in LA. So, anyway guys, have a

03:16:50.261 --> 03:16:54.189
wonderful evening, see you next week, and is it
Thursday yet?

03:16:54.189 --> 03:16:57.298
(cheering)

03:16:57.298 --> 03:19:27.675
