00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.911
MATT: Hello everyone, and welcome to this
evening's episode of Critical Role, where a bunch

00:00:03.911 --> 00:00:08.931
of us nerdy-ass voice actors, some of us far from
our place on the Internet, sit around and play

00:00:08.931 --> 00:00:15.600
Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons, throw some dice, and all that
insanity. So, welcome to the chaos. Let's see,

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.005
first and foremost, let's go ahead and get some
announcements out of the way so we can hop into

00:00:19.005 --> 00:00:26.115
the game proper. Sam is on his way, per usual.
Liam is here via Internet.

00:00:26.115 --> 00:00:27.777
LAURA: Can you see him, is he there?

00:00:27.777 --> 00:00:29.708
MATT: There we go, there's our Liam.

00:00:29.708 --> 00:00:30.977
TALIESIN: Digital Liam.

00:00:30.977 --> 00:00:32.335
LAURA: My brother.

00:00:32.335 --> 00:00:33.383
LIAM: What?

00:00:33.383 --> 00:00:35.218
LAURA: I can't see you, you're hiding in the
shadows.

00:00:35.218 --> 00:00:36.287
LIAM: Can you hear me?

00:00:36.287 --> 00:00:37.346
LAURA: I can, yes.

00:00:37.346 --> 00:00:39.919
MATT: Wonders of the Internet.

00:00:39.919 --> 00:00:41.853
LIAM: I'm in the Bag of Holding.

00:00:41.853 --> 00:00:47.574
MATT: That's not going to end well for you, if
oxen have shown us anything. Yeah, poor Dork.

00:00:47.574 --> 00:00:49.329
Always remember Dork.

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:50.836
TRAVIS: Never forget.

00:00:50.836 --> 00:01:00.042
MATT: That's another shirt. Have a seat. Hello!

00:01:00.042 --> 00:01:04.372
LIAM: I can see you guys on Twitch! Did you know
you're on the Internet?

00:01:04.372 --> 00:01:06.338
LAURA: What? You're crazy!

00:01:06.338 --> 00:01:07.665
MARISHA: Someone's watching?

00:01:07.665 --> 00:01:08.988
TRAVIS: Don't make it weird, man.

00:01:08.988 --> 00:01:13.669
MATT: Don't make it weird, Liam. All right, let's
go ahead and plug through these announcements so

00:01:13.669 --> 00:01:14.879
we can get into the game.

00:01:14.879 --> 00:01:15.933
LAURA: Yes, yes.

00:01:15.933 --> 00:01:19.610
MATT: First thing, me and Marisha wanted to reach
out and let everyone know that we're going to be

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:28.464
guests next weekend, I believe it's
the 8th through the 10th, at an event called

00:01:28.464 --> 00:01:31.845
Tekko. Tekko in Pittsburgh. It's an awesome
convention, we're going to be doing panels

00:01:31.845 --> 00:01:36.072
and signings, all that fun stuff. So if any of you
are in that area, you should come hang out at

00:01:36.072 --> 00:01:38.258
Tekko with us, in a week. That would be awesome.

00:01:38.258 --> 00:01:39.593
MARISHA: My old stomping grounds.

00:01:39.593 --> 00:01:40.609
MATT: There you go.

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:42.501
MARISHA: College days, yeah.

00:01:42.501 --> 00:01:47.000
TRAVIS: Aw, sad Affleck.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:55.659
MATT: Sad Affleck, best game ever. Watched it over
and over again. All right, so. Today, guys, is the

00:01:55.659 --> 00:02:00.960
last day to pre-order your Gilmore's Glorious
Goods shirts. We've had them up for a week. There's

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:07.679
a delightful presentation by our lovely Liam. You
should pick one up. I should pick one up. I don't

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:13.741
have one myself, yet. Yeah, go ahead and preorder
a copy. We're trying out this new process to get

00:02:13.741 --> 00:02:17.217
shirts out to everyone, so get that one before
they're gone.

00:02:17.217 --> 00:02:18.658
TRAVIS: It's actually tomorrow.

00:02:18.658 --> 00:02:19.529
MATT: Tomorrow.

00:02:19.529 --> 00:02:21.764
TRAVIS: Tomorrow at midnight is the deadline.

00:02:21.764 --> 00:02:23.931
MATT: So would that be like midnight tonight,
or--?

00:02:23.931 --> 00:02:25.880
LAURA: See, that's exactly what I was asking
Travis.

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.736
TRAVIS: You smart son of a bitches. It's so
simple. Tomorrow at midnight.

00:02:29.736 --> 00:02:31.721
LAURA: Is like in a few hours.

00:02:31.721 --> 00:02:34.007
TRAVIS: Oh my god. Oh my god.

00:02:34.007 --> 00:02:38.929
TALIESIN: 12:01 is the start of the next day. 
Midnight is still today.

00:02:38.929 --> 00:02:40.268
LAURA: Oh, really?

00:02:40.313 --> 00:02:42.536
TALIESIN: Sure. I could be wrong.

00:02:42.536 --> 00:02:44.402
MARISHA: It's 12:00 am.

00:02:44.402 --> 00:02:48.737
LAURA: Is it ending tomorrow night, or is it
ending tonight?

00:02:48.737 --> 00:02:49.981
TRAVIS: Holy shit.

00:02:49.981 --> 00:02:52.262
MATT: I don't know. You should order tonight, just
in case!

00:02:52.262 --> 00:02:56.014
LAURA: I'm scared it's actually ending tonight. He
thinks it's tomorrow night, but I think it might

00:02:56.014 --> 00:02:57.136
be tonight.

00:02:57.136 --> 00:02:59.331
MATT: To be safe, make it tonight, but it's
probably tomorrow night.

00:02:59.331 --> 00:03:00.467
LAURA: It's probably tomorrow night.

00:03:00.467 --> 00:03:01.742
MATT: But to be safe, make it tonight.

00:03:01.742 --> 00:03:04.187
LAURA: He's going to murder us all, very shortly.

00:03:04.187 --> 00:03:09.743
MATT: Save it for the battle. Save it for the
battle, Travis. Also, is it already up in the

00:03:09.743 --> 00:03:10.892
store now?

00:03:10.892 --> 00:03:13.008
TRAVIS: Yes, 6:30 today, it went up.

00:03:13.008 --> 00:03:17.765
MATT: All right, we have two new shirts. Two new
shirts available for pre-order, guys.

00:03:17.765 --> 00:03:21.051
LAURA: All these overlapping things
happening?

00:03:21.051 --> 00:03:22.691
TALIESIN: These two new shirts.

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:24.458
SAM: Whoa, what's that say?

00:03:24.458 --> 00:03:26.115
MATT: Dagger, dagger, dagger.

00:03:26.115 --> 00:03:28.555
SAM: Dagger, dagger-- jagger? Why would it say
jagger?

00:03:28.555 --> 00:03:29.492
TALIESIN: In honor of Mick Jagger.

00:03:29.492 --> 00:03:30.775
SAM: Oh, okay.

00:03:30.775 --> 00:03:35.704
LAURA: And we've got our Critical Role logo 
on the back. So cool.

00:03:35.704 --> 00:03:37.214
MARISHA: So you know it's official.

00:03:37.214 --> 00:03:38.948
TRAVIS: I really like these ones.

00:03:38.948 --> 00:03:42.565
LAURA: They're soft, they feel very nice on your
body.

00:03:42.565 --> 00:03:43.627
MARISHA: They do.

00:03:43.627 --> 00:03:50.571
LAURA: But yeah, those will be up as well for a
week for pre-order, so yeah, check those out. Get

00:03:50.571 --> 00:03:56.736
whatever shirts you can. And I think there's a
limited amount available for purchase right away,

00:03:56.736 --> 00:04:04.210
so if you order fast, you might be able to get
them. But that's a very small amount. And also, to

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:09.231
everybody that's been messaging us on Twitter,
there have been some people that have really been

00:04:09.231 --> 00:04:13.549
wanting us to expand our sizing and we are
definitely working on that. It's hard to find some

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:19.904
vendors that can accommodate us, but we're working
on it, so hopefully moving forward in the future,

00:04:19.904 --> 00:04:22.114
we'll have larger sizes available to everyone.

00:04:22.114 --> 00:04:29.079
MATT: Yeah, we're really, really trying to do
that. Soon. Soon, we'll have announcements. Great,

00:04:29.079 --> 00:04:35.103
so there is also-- let's see, Sam, you had an
announcement about a cartoon?

00:04:35.103 --> 00:04:43.689
SAM: Oh, oh yes. I've been voice directing this
cartoon called Home, based on the movie Home with

00:04:43.689 --> 00:04:50.466
Dreamworks and they just announced today that it
exists. So it's coming out in a week, and it's

00:04:50.466 --> 00:04:53.884
going to be really good. It's a really fun show.
Zaniness.

00:04:53.884 --> 00:04:55.405
TALIESIN: Kooky zany.

00:04:55.445 --> 00:04:57.602
SAM: Kooky zany. Kooky zany. Big, bright colors.

00:04:57.602 --> 00:05:04.085
MATT: Fantastic. Also, tonight is our 47th
episode, we are three episodes away from our big

00:05:04.131 --> 00:05:11.563
50th episode. It'll be a regular episode of this,
depending on where the story is at the time, but

00:05:11.563 --> 00:05:17.505
it'll be special because it's our 50th. Also,
we'll have a couple surprises and we'll be doing

00:05:17.505 --> 00:05:26.223
our big Critmas blowout right after the 50th
episode. Then we'll be putting to rest until the

00:05:26.223 --> 00:05:31.219
holidays come around, but yeah, look forward to
that 50th episode when it hits, guys. So make sure

00:05:31.219 --> 00:05:35.858
you don't miss it. Mark off your calendar. I
already did. But I have to. Every week. So I don't

00:05:35.858 --> 00:05:41.969
have a choice, but you do, and you should come.
Anybody else have any other announcements they want to

00:05:41.969 --> 00:05:43.105
make?

00:05:43.105 --> 00:05:48.997
LIAM: Oh my gosh, Laura, hold up my boxes. Do you
have items that need to be put inside boxes when

00:05:49.045 --> 00:05:53.783
you're not holding dice? Because Wyrmwood Gaming
makes boxes for your dice and if you use the code

00:05:53.783 --> 00:05:54.783
"critrole"--

00:05:54.783 --> 00:05:56.602
LAURA: Critrole! Critrole!

00:05:56.602 --> 00:05:58.760
LIAM: You can get free shipping.

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:04.127
MATT: (laughs) It never makes me not laugh.

00:06:04.127 --> 00:06:08.315
LAURA: By the way, I have some of Liam's dice in
front of me.

00:06:08.315 --> 00:06:09.856
MARISHA: Oh, snap.

00:06:09.856 --> 00:06:12.382
LAURA: Maybe my brother should hang onto his
things.

00:06:12.382 --> 00:06:15.024
LIAM: Don't infect my dice!

00:06:15.024 --> 00:06:18.488
MATT: Cool, anything else, guys? We good?

00:06:18.488 --> 00:06:24.557
MARISHA: My last episode of Signal Boost is this
Tuesday.

00:06:24.557 --> 00:06:26.345
SAM: What do you mean last? You just started!

00:06:26.345 --> 00:06:27.925
MARISHA: Yeah, we rotate hosts out.

00:06:27.925 --> 00:06:28.796
SAM: Oh.

00:06:28.796 --> 00:06:30.664
MARISHA: Because it's like our favorite things and
I don't want to have to--

00:06:30.664 --> 00:06:31.873
SAM: But you're the best host.

00:06:31.873 --> 00:06:33.001
MARISHA: Oh, thank you, Sam.

00:06:33.001 --> 00:06:35.257
TALIESIN: Of all the hosts they've had, she
certainly was the best one.

00:06:35.302 --> 00:06:36.647
SAM: Yes, she's number one.

00:06:36.647 --> 00:06:39.681
MARISHA: Thank you. I'm glad my friends support
me.

00:06:39.681 --> 00:06:41.664
MATT: It's still your show, you still produce it.

00:06:41.664 --> 00:06:46.793
MARISHA: Yes, yeah. I'm not letting it go. I'm
still producing it.

00:06:46.793 --> 00:06:49.326
SAM: Just tell me, am I one of the hosts?

00:06:49.326 --> 00:06:50.723
MARISHA: Do you want to host?

00:06:50.723 --> 00:06:56.059
SAM: Just tell me when, and I will be probably be
20 minutes late.

00:06:56.059 --> 00:06:58.183
MARISHA: Okay, I'll make that work.

00:06:58.183 --> 00:07:01.866
TRAVIS: That's what these pre-show announcements are,
is trailers for those that are late to the stream,

00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:07.006
they don't miss anything. But, see, Batman vs.
Superman, no trailers. Scared the shit out of me.

00:07:07.052 --> 00:07:10.320
You can't do that to somebody. That's half of the
joy of going to the movies.

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:18.477
MATT: What? Yeah. That's half the joy gone and
then you have the movie. Sorry. Anyway, so--

00:07:18.477 --> 00:07:23.797
LIAM: Oh wait, I got one last thing, it's not
really a professional announcement, but I am

00:07:23.797 --> 00:07:29.186
sitting in the kitchen that I grew up in. I'm
playing Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons in the first room that

00:07:29.186 --> 00:07:31.920
I ever played Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons in.

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:34.063
MATT: That's awesome.

00:07:34.063 --> 00:07:36.433
LAURA: That's a wonderful announcement.

00:07:36.433 --> 00:07:48.505
MATT: Fantastic. Well, cool, guys, then let's go
ahead and get this show on the road. So, last we

00:07:48.505 --> 00:07:54.756
left off, Vox Machina, having to traverse the
world in search of artifacts known as the Vestiges

00:07:54.756 --> 00:08:01.246
of Divergence, ancient items of power used in
massive-scale warfare in ancient moments of

00:08:01.246 --> 00:08:07.218
history, they had acquired one from a sunken
temple of the Champion of the Raven Queen, taking

00:08:07.218 --> 00:08:13.076
the life, and thankfully not permanently, of
Vex'ahlia over here. The party then retrieved

00:08:13.076 --> 00:08:18.846
their first artifact and made their way towards
the Pyrah tribe of the Ashari druids, the Fire

00:08:18.846 --> 00:08:25.250
Guardians of the Gate to the Elemental Plane of
Fire, which apparently Thordak, the Cinder King,

00:08:25.250 --> 00:08:30.704
the great red dragon that helms the Chroma
Conclave that just tore through all of the

00:08:30.704 --> 00:08:33.304
civilization of Tal'Dorei, emerged from.

00:08:33.304 --> 00:08:34.491
MARISHA: "Apparently."

00:08:34.491 --> 00:08:41.582
MATT: "Apparently." By that I mean, confirmed,
universally, tore through. You guys went there,

00:08:41.582 --> 00:08:49.057
found a surviving faction of the Pyrah tribe,
including Cerkonos, their Headmaster, as well as a

00:08:49.057 --> 00:08:56.784
few members of your tribe, the Air Ashari,
Keyleth. And your father. You went towards the

00:08:56.784 --> 00:09:04.701
remnants of the Cindergrove, ran into an ally, a
strange blue-scaled dragonborn by the name of Gern

00:09:04.701 --> 00:09:12.897
Blanston, master of necromancy and candle-making
and combining the two for interesting effect. You

00:09:12.897 --> 00:09:23.021
fought your way through the Cindergrove, tearing
through elementals, encasing efreets in hamster

00:09:23.021 --> 00:09:29.077
balls and holding them aloft for extended periods
of time. Worked out well. And then managed to seal

00:09:29.077 --> 00:09:34.710
the Gate with the help of the druidic tribes
there, Gern, and the intrepid adventurers of Vox

00:09:34.710 --> 00:09:40.562
Machina. After which, you went to spend the evening
there on the mountainside to rest before

00:09:40.562 --> 00:09:49.119
continuing your journey to wherever that next step
may be. So the rest of you are beaten, bruised,

00:09:49.119 --> 00:09:54.030
and winded over the previous series of battles and
the accomplishment you achieved here at the top

00:09:54.030 --> 00:10:00.189
of the caldera of this mountain. The erupting,
seismic energies and molten rock that once spewed

00:10:00.189 --> 00:10:06.285
from the center of this rift have calmed, and the
gate once again has been sealed to its dormant,

00:10:06.285 --> 00:10:12.774
controllable, and watchable size. You guys are
free to make camp wherever you'd like.

00:10:12.774 --> 00:10:15.629
LAURA: We already rested, though?

00:10:15.629 --> 00:10:20.953
MATT: Not yet, you're about to set up rest. There
are sections, as you're walking out of the

00:10:20.953 --> 00:10:27.091
Cindergrove, that you can see members of the Pyrah
tribe are pulling up still-functional pieces of

00:10:27.091 --> 00:10:33.396
huts and tents and things that were destroyed when
Thordak tore through the rift, and they're

00:10:33.396 --> 00:10:37.911
beginning to reassemble a place to stay for the
evening for themselves, so if you wish to stay

00:10:37.911 --> 00:10:41.982
among the Pyrah tribe for the evening, it seems to
be at least a relatively safe bet.

00:10:41.982 --> 00:10:46.502
LAURA: What do you think, Keyleth? I mean, it's
your family.

00:10:46.502 --> 00:10:54.082
MARISHA: That's up to you guys. I don't think I
can transport us out of here until we sleep.

00:10:54.082 --> 00:10:57.150
TALIESIN: I have no problem sleeping here this
evening.

00:10:57.150 --> 00:10:59.079
LAURA: I'm rather winded, actually.

00:10:59.079 --> 00:11:00.031
TALIESIN: Yes.

00:11:00.031 --> 00:11:02.600
TRAVIS: What are all the tents and houses made of,
anyway?

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:10.118
MATT: Most of them are made of pieces of stone.
The actual blackened grey rock of this mountain,

00:11:10.118 --> 00:11:15.847
elements of it have been fused together with bits
of glass to forge these thick, very sturdy walls

00:11:15.847 --> 00:11:19.219
when they aren't being torn through by a colossal
red dragon.

00:11:19.219 --> 00:11:20.563
TRAVIS: (scoffs) Whatever.

00:11:20.563 --> 00:11:25.121
MATT: So they're being brought back up, druids are
using what remains of their powers from the fight

00:11:25.121 --> 00:11:32.274
today to assemble more walls of stone, and they're
basically creating ramshackle living spaces using

00:11:32.274 --> 00:11:33.826
their magic.

00:11:33.826 --> 00:11:37.560
MARISHA: I'm going to go ahead and assist them,
because I didn't use any 5th-level spells.

00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:44.683
MATT: All right. So you begin throwing up some
stone walls to help build a small shelter for the

00:11:44.683 --> 00:11:46.803
evening. The rest--

00:11:46.803 --> 00:11:49.551
LAURA: Is Gern completely out of the picture, have
we lost sight of him?

00:11:49.551 --> 00:11:53.457
MATT: You've lost sight of Gern, Gern went back
into the Cindergrove and began essentially

00:11:53.457 --> 00:12:00.679
gutter-sniping what pieces of red dragon scales he
could locate in the vicinity. He has not been seen

00:12:00.679 --> 00:12:04.096
since that moment. Who knows to where he wandered?

00:12:04.141 --> 00:12:05.862
SAM: Key-leth? If I may.

00:12:05.862 --> 00:12:07.251
MARISHA: Yes, Scan-lan?

00:12:07.251 --> 00:12:08.717
LAURA: You said that so weird.

00:12:08.717 --> 00:12:10.510
SAM: That's how it's spelled: Key-leth.

00:12:10.510 --> 00:12:14.189
MARISHA: So regal of you, Scan-lan.

00:12:14.189 --> 00:12:20.061
SAM: Are your people comfortable in these little
huts and stuff, are we going to be safe tonight?

00:12:20.061 --> 00:12:23.557
Because I could assist us with slightly better
shelter.

00:12:23.557 --> 00:12:25.764
LAURA: Like how, what do you mean?

00:12:25.764 --> 00:12:29.024
SAM: With my magical... dalliances.

00:12:29.024 --> 00:12:31.494
TRAVIS: Is that another name for your penis?

00:12:31.494 --> 00:12:33.204
SAM: It is.

00:12:33.204 --> 00:12:35.876
LAURA: Are you going to poop us a bed?

00:12:35.876 --> 00:12:42.126
SAM: I could poop us a bed. Are we okay here,
safely, or should I get us something special?

00:12:42.126 --> 00:12:43.478
TALIESIN: With your dalliance.

00:12:43.478 --> 00:12:44.647
SAM: With my dalliance.

00:12:44.647 --> 00:12:47.560
TALIESIN: I think your penis may have more names
than I do, I'm kind of horrified.

00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:49.933
TRAVIS: Yeah, I want a house from your balls and
bits.

00:12:49.933 --> 00:12:55.573
MARISHA: I mean, my people have lived here for
thousands of years.

00:12:55.573 --> 00:12:58.372
SAM: Yes, but their shelters are destroyed now,
so.

00:12:58.372 --> 00:13:02.010
MARISHA: Sure, I mean, generally we're safe as
long as dragons aren't smashing through the

00:13:02.010 --> 00:13:06.120
village, but I mean, if you have an alternative.

00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:10.784
SAM: I have an alternative. I could do a bit of
dalliancing.

00:13:10.784 --> 00:13:15.023
MARISHA: You know, you've talked about it so much
now, Scanlan.

00:13:15.023 --> 00:13:17.886
TALIESIN: Is this going to be
self-dalliance or are you going to need a partner

00:13:17.919 --> 00:13:18.864
or two?

00:13:18.864 --> 00:13:20.739
LAURA: I know, are we just going to watch you
diddle yourself? Let's have it.

00:13:20.739 --> 00:13:22.352
TRAVIS: Mushroom-stamp the land, let's go.

00:13:22.352 --> 00:13:29.496
SAM: No, no, so I will take a minute and cast
Mordenkainen's Magnificent Mansion.

00:13:29.496 --> 00:13:33.158
TALIESIN: I am so proud of you. I am so proud of
you.

00:13:33.158 --> 00:13:37.304
MATT: Okay, so you guys watch as Scanlan rummages
through some of his side pouches and belongings,

00:13:37.304 --> 00:13:44.577
pulls out a few elements, a small doorway carved
from ivory. He pulls out a piece of polished

00:13:44.577 --> 00:13:49.764
marble, a tiny silver spoon, and puts them on the
ground in front of him, closes his eyes for a

00:13:49.764 --> 00:13:50.815
second--

00:13:50.815 --> 00:13:54.355
SAM: Can I enchant it with a little song or
something?

00:13:54.355 --> 00:13:55.646
MATT: Yes you may.

00:13:55.646 --> 00:14:04.290
SAM: So I'll sing (singing) It's a sick house,
it's mighty mighty, it's letting it all hang--

00:14:04.290 --> 00:14:05.369
that's it.

00:14:05.369 --> 00:14:10.038
MATT: You guys are mildly confused, but as he
picks up the items, you can see the door sets off

00:14:10.038 --> 00:14:16.186
this small spark of white energy that glistens in
the air, hovers, and then creates a somewhat

00:14:16.186 --> 00:14:20.490
shimmering doorway, just standing in the center of
the space in front of you.

00:14:20.490 --> 00:14:23.821
LAURA: What?

00:14:23.821 --> 00:14:31.465
SAM: Would you like to come into my place? It's a
little modest shack that I've been working on.

00:14:31.465 --> 00:14:33.340
LAURA: Is this a teleport sort of--

00:14:33.340 --> 00:14:34.359
TRAVIS: It's a door.

00:14:34.359 --> 00:14:35.437
MARISHA: Is this a joke?

00:14:35.437 --> 00:14:37.253
TALIESIN: There's nothing on the other side of it,
is there?

00:14:37.253 --> 00:14:43.263
SAM: No, no, it's a place where we can rest for
the evening, totally safe and comfortable. It's on

00:14:43.263 --> 00:14:48.276
a slightly different plane from ours, so nothing
can actually hurt us there or get to us.

00:14:48.276 --> 00:14:54.320
LAURA: Is it that fire plane where we just--
there's no dragons in that plane?

00:14:54.320 --> 00:15:01.696
SAM: I haven't checked in a while. Actually, this
is my first time doing this.

00:15:01.696 --> 00:15:05.623
TRAVIS: We should send somebody ahead first to
check. Vax, are you up to the bit?

00:15:05.623 --> 00:15:08.745
LIAM: Am I up to what? What was that, Grog?

00:15:08.745 --> 00:15:11.296
SAM: It's totally safe, don't worry, don't worry.

00:15:11.296 --> 00:15:15.094
LIAM: As long as you're not going to whip out the
cube, then lead the way.

00:15:15.094 --> 00:15:19.354
SAM: How many people can fit in there? It's pretty
big.

00:15:19.354 --> 00:15:26.283
MATT: Any creature you designate when you cast the
spell to enter. So you could say the entire Pyrah

00:15:26.283 --> 00:15:27.585
tribe if you wanted.

00:15:27.585 --> 00:15:28.461
LAURA: What?

00:15:28.461 --> 00:15:29.498
SAM: Everybody.

00:15:29.498 --> 00:15:30.907
MATT: Everybody in the group, or the Pyrah?

00:15:30.907 --> 00:15:32.346
SAM: How many are there?

00:15:32.346 --> 00:15:36.422
MATT: Here, there's close to 35, including the
Zephrah.

00:15:36.422 --> 00:15:42.090
LAURA: Wait, could you technically do this with
any refugees? I mean, where do they go when you

00:15:42.123 --> 00:15:43.754
make the door go away?

00:15:43.754 --> 00:15:50.865
SAM: This is my place, all right? I don't want any
riffraff in there. Listen, there's a guest list,

00:15:50.865 --> 00:15:52.688
there's a guy at the door--

00:15:52.688 --> 00:15:56.536
TALIESIN: I can solve this really quickly. Are any
of the Pyrah tribe hot?

00:15:56.536 --> 00:15:59.713
LAURA: Like, attractive?

00:15:59.713 --> 00:16:00.917
TALIESIN: Attractive.

00:16:00.917 --> 00:16:02.118
LAURA: They're all hot.

00:16:02.118 --> 00:16:09.760
MATT: Through the soot and ash and the rather
somber atmosphere here that paints them as a

00:16:09.805 --> 00:16:14.267
people that are the survivors of a horrible
calamity, beyond that, there's probably a few that

00:16:14.267 --> 00:16:16.353
you'd consider attractive, sure, if you're that
kind of person.

00:16:16.353 --> 00:16:18.482
TALIESIN: That one over there was looking at you,
I saw her wink at you earlier.

00:16:18.482 --> 00:16:19.462
SAM: Oh, really?

00:16:19.462 --> 00:16:20.388
TALIESIN: You should impress her.

00:16:20.388 --> 00:16:22.478
SAM: The one with her face just sheared off?

00:16:22.478 --> 00:16:23.710
TALIESIN: Yeah, why not?

00:16:23.710 --> 00:16:32.051
SAM: All right. Not really my type. I like
full-faced people, but I'll take it, I'll take my

00:16:32.051 --> 00:16:33.277
chance.

00:16:33.277 --> 00:16:34.655
TALIESIN: I think that's big of you.

00:16:34.655 --> 00:16:35.771
LAURA: So terrible.

00:16:35.771 --> 00:16:39.950
SAM: You know, if there's anyone from your
immediate family that you'd like to give lodging

00:16:39.950 --> 00:16:44.201
to tonight-- okay, we'll take them all, we'll take
them all in. We'll take them all in.

00:16:44.201 --> 00:16:47.987
MARISHA: Sure. Do you want to tell them? It is
your humble abode.

00:16:47.987 --> 00:16:49.262
SAM: Ashari people!

00:16:49.262 --> 00:16:50.494
MARISHA: All right.

00:16:50.494 --> 00:16:53.963
MATT: You see some of them stop and drop the rocks
they're currently holding and building some of

00:16:53.963 --> 00:16:55.231
these small shelters.

00:16:55.231 --> 00:17:00.440
SAM: Don't worry about your shelter for tonight.
Let Scanlan Shorthalt take care of you, in every

00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:06.814
way, shape, and form imaginable. Come with me
through this weird magic door into another plane.

00:17:06.814 --> 00:17:09.753
Believe me, it's going to be okay.

00:17:09.753 --> 00:17:15.967
MATT: They all look at each other with a strange
glance and continue building their current

00:17:15.967 --> 00:17:16.949
shelters.

00:17:16.949 --> 00:17:18.668
LAURA: Why the fuck not? And I walk on through.

00:17:18.668 --> 00:17:23.337
MATT: Okay. You open the door, and as you grab it,
it is a solid door, and the handle spins, you look

00:17:23.337 --> 00:17:33.682
inside, and within you see an incredibly lush
foyer to a grand mansion, a 25-, 30-foot ceiling

00:17:33.682 --> 00:17:39.048
made of marble and dark woods, you see a two-part
staircase that splits off onto a second-tier

00:17:39.048 --> 00:17:44.152
floor, you hear soft music playing in the
distance, and immediately you see two somewhat

00:17:44.152 --> 00:17:48.783
ethereal servants come down, dressed as a butler
and a maid, they come down, with an echoing voice

00:17:48.783 --> 00:17:51.306
that say, "How might we be of service?"

00:17:51.306 --> 00:17:52.713
LAURA: What the fuck.

00:17:52.713 --> 00:17:58.799
SAM: Hi. I step in after her. Yes, I've made some
changes to the place. Living quarters are

00:17:58.799 --> 00:18:04.505
upstairs, there's a kitchen, parlor, game room
over there, billiards, all sorts of stuff. We have

00:18:04.505 --> 00:18:11.432
a music room. There are a hundred attendants who
can wait on us. I've assigned some of them

00:18:11.432 --> 00:18:16.906
specific jobs. Five are going to play music for us
wherever we want, especially during our meals.

00:18:16.906 --> 00:18:19.324
MATT: "Let me take your things, Master."

00:18:19.324 --> 00:18:20.523
SAM: Oh, yes, yes, here.

00:18:20.523 --> 00:18:24.923
TRAVIS: I come inside and I see the ethereal
things, I'm like, ghosts! And I take Craven Edge

00:18:24.923 --> 00:18:27.546
and I swing at the ethereal sumbitch!

00:18:27.546 --> 00:18:34.502
SAM: Are you attacking my attendants?

00:18:34.502 --> 00:18:36.757
TRAVIS: No, the ghosts in your house!

00:18:36.757 --> 00:18:38.538
SAM: They're my people!

00:18:38.538 --> 00:18:39.397
TRAVIS: What?

00:18:39.397 --> 00:18:42.336
MATT: By the time you go to stop him, three of the
servants that have grabbed a few of your

00:18:42.336 --> 00:18:47.025
belongings and been carrying away, are swung at,
Craven Edge passing through, and their energy

00:18:47.025 --> 00:18:51.054
dispersing, and their contents of whatever they're
carrying drop and clink to the ground.

00:18:51.054 --> 00:18:52.103
LAURA: No!

00:18:52.103 --> 00:18:53.487
SAM: Jesus Christ--

00:18:53.487 --> 00:18:54.536
TRAVIS: Thank god I'm here.

00:18:54.536 --> 00:19:00.207
SAM: Grog, Grog, easy. Easy. They're not ghosts,
they're not ghosts. They are supernatural

00:19:00.207 --> 00:19:07.872
spirits-- some would say ghosts-- that are good,
they serve us, they serve me--

00:19:07.872 --> 00:19:10.791
LAURA: Wait, do you pay them or do they just work for
you?

00:19:10.791 --> 00:19:12.971
SAM: They're slave ghosts.

00:19:12.971 --> 00:19:15.280
LAURA: This is terrible. Scanlan!

00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:17.441
SAM: Well, no, they like it for some reason.

00:19:17.441 --> 00:19:18.354
LAURA: Are you sure?

00:19:18.354 --> 00:19:21.014
SAM: I can command them to do literally anything
and they like it.

00:19:21.014 --> 00:19:22.039
LAURA: Have you asked them?

00:19:22.039 --> 00:19:24.758
SAM: Watch this. Watch this. I call one over. You
there, you there.

00:19:24.758 --> 00:19:31.276
MATT: This maid comes over, a plumper older woman,
no feet, just drifting along with this path of

00:19:31.276 --> 00:19:34.087
mist behind her. "Yes, Master?"

00:19:34.087 --> 00:19:35.874
SAM: Can you please braid my chest hair?

00:19:35.874 --> 00:19:37.779
MATT: "But of course, Master."

00:19:37.779 --> 00:19:39.466
SAM: Do you like this job?

00:19:39.466 --> 00:19:41.755
MATT: "It is my purpose, Master."

00:19:41.755 --> 00:19:43.511
SAM: See? This is what I'm telling you.

00:19:43.511 --> 00:19:45.657
LAURA: Your purpose, do you enjoy your purpose?

00:19:45.657 --> 00:19:50.367
MATT: "What does one but enjoy their purpose in
life?" And continues braiding his chest hair,

00:19:50.367 --> 00:19:54.319
these tiny little hairs, doing a very good job.
It's not very long, but sure enough, there is a

00:19:54.319 --> 00:19:55.530
pattern.

00:19:55.530 --> 00:19:56.338
LAURA: Wow.

00:19:56.338 --> 00:19:58.658
SAM: Thank you, you're dismissed. Back to the
music room.

00:19:58.658 --> 00:19:59.871
MATT: "Of course, Master."

00:19:59.871 --> 00:20:00.977
LAURA: Do you tip them?

00:20:00.977 --> 00:20:02.441
SAM: You can tip me, I'll pass it out later.

00:20:02.441 --> 00:20:03.710
LAURA: I believe you.

00:20:03.710 --> 00:20:08.466
TRAVIS: Hey, you there, you, ghostie, do you have
any ale in this establishment?

00:20:08.466 --> 00:20:12.667
MATT: "But of course, sir. We have an entire winery
as part of the mansion."

00:20:12.667 --> 00:20:16.549
LAURA: What in the fuck is this place? How are you
doing this?

00:20:16.549 --> 00:20:18.918
TRAVIS: Bring your most expensive frosty glass of
ale.

00:20:18.918 --> 00:20:20.635
MATT: "All right."

00:20:20.635 --> 00:20:23.350
LIAM: I pull Scanlan over to the
side. Have you always been able to do this? Have

00:20:23.350 --> 00:20:25.415
you been holding out on us, man?

00:20:25.415 --> 00:20:28.566
SAM: It never occurred to me to do this before,
for some reason.

00:20:28.566 --> 00:20:33.055
TRAVIS: You shouldn't be Burt Reynolds, you should
be Hugh Hefner from now on.

00:20:33.055 --> 00:20:41.248
SAM: No, this is a skill that I recently acquired.
I would not hold out on you. This is a new skill

00:20:41.248 --> 00:20:46.789
that I've just learned, and I'm still making
improvements to the house. You'll see that our

00:20:46.789 --> 00:20:54.866
dining room has a portrait of myself in it. Not
the one that I had commissioned, but one that I

00:20:54.866 --> 00:21:02.253
had envisioned before. It's just me in a smoking
jacket standing in front of a fireplace with me in

00:21:02.253 --> 00:21:05.966
a smoking jacket above it, Stephen Colbert-style.

00:21:05.966 --> 00:21:07.184
TRAVIS: Really?

00:21:07.184 --> 00:21:15.575
SAM: And we all have our own separate rooms. All
of the beds are circular, they all have a mirror

00:21:15.575 --> 00:21:16.602
over them.

00:21:16.602 --> 00:21:19.780
TRAVIS: Oh my god. It's Graceland!

00:21:19.780 --> 00:21:23.772
SAM: Mine is a waterbed, so be careful.

00:21:23.772 --> 00:21:28.132
LAURA: So wait, you built this entire castle, so
how do we know that you haven't installed creepy

00:21:28.132 --> 00:21:30.678
spy things into our rooms, Scanlan?

00:21:30.678 --> 00:21:31.992
MARISHA: Yeah, little peep holes.

00:21:31.992 --> 00:21:32.846
LAURA: I don't trust you.

00:21:32.846 --> 00:21:35.404
SAM: On we go to the rest of it!

00:21:35.404 --> 00:21:37.026
TRAVIS: I'm waiting on my beer.

00:21:37.026 --> 00:21:40.650
TALIESIN: I've got a great idea. Let's get some
beer, let's take a rest, and in the morning we can

00:21:40.650 --> 00:21:44.340
go to the game room, get some dice and some
paper--

00:21:44.340 --> 00:21:50.924
TRAVIS: A game within a game. The Inception (bass
note).

00:21:50.924 --> 00:21:53.439
TALIESIN: It's called Meta and Dragons, we're just
going to see how deep it goes.

00:21:53.439 --> 00:21:56.964
MARISHA: Keyleth just gets a nosebleed for no
reason. She's not sure why.

00:21:56.964 --> 00:21:58.779
TALIESIN: Had to get that out of my system.

00:21:58.779 --> 00:22:03.521
MATT: An ever-spinning top on the banister. At
this point, Grog, you can see that the servant you

00:22:03.521 --> 00:22:08.345
had sent off comes up with a very large, somewhat
spectral flagon, that upon handing it to you,

00:22:08.345 --> 00:22:11.635
turns into a solid metallic form, and inside--

00:22:11.635 --> 00:22:12.705
TRAVIS: Holy shit.

00:22:12.705 --> 00:22:15.776
MATT: -- a very, very finely chilled, very
nice-smelling wine.

00:22:15.776 --> 00:22:17.367
TRAVIS: I put my hand up for a high-five.

00:22:17.367 --> 00:22:19.511
MATT: It makes contact.

00:22:19.511 --> 00:22:20.460
TRAVIS: It does?

00:22:20.460 --> 00:22:22.607
MATT: A little cushy, but it does make contact,
yes.

00:22:22.607 --> 00:22:25.597
TRAVIS: Wait, these servants will do whatever you
want to do?

00:22:25.597 --> 00:22:30.811
LAURA: That is terrible, it's a terrible path
you're going down right now, I am uncomfortable

00:22:30.811 --> 00:22:31.510
with this--

00:22:31.510 --> 00:22:37.027
SAM: I am way ahead of you, Grog. I'm way ahead of
you. As I said, there are 100 servants here. 50 of

00:22:37.027 --> 00:22:43.850
them are assigned to me and my own personal
service. The rest are available to you in whatever

00:22:43.850 --> 00:22:45.405
capacity you'd like them.

00:22:45.405 --> 00:22:47.805
TRAVIS: This is going to be the best night ever.

00:22:47.805 --> 00:22:50.984
MARISHA: Let me go try and gather the rest of the
Ashari.

00:22:50.984 --> 00:22:53.435
LAURA: So uncomfortable right now.

00:22:53.435 --> 00:22:58.610
MARISHA: Can I get a plate of food from one of the
ghosts as proof?

00:22:58.610 --> 00:23:01.874
TRAVIS: It's about to get Caligula up in this
bitch.

00:23:01.874 --> 00:23:07.991
MATT: The servants gather up a platter of food,
piling up, grapes and meats and cured ham.

00:23:07.991 --> 00:23:11.971
MARISHA: I just pop out of the door and address
the people.

00:23:11.971 --> 00:23:15.776
MATT: As soon as you pop out of the door, it all
turns to smoke and dissipates.

00:23:15.776 --> 00:23:30.098
MARISHA: Aw, son of a-- Hey, guys, hey. It's okay.
It's actually really nice. It's been rough, why

00:23:30.098 --> 00:23:35.124
don't we all take a night off and everyone come in
and get some food. Take a night off.

00:23:35.124 --> 00:23:37.114
LAURA: Scanlan, where are we staying? Where's our
rooms?

00:23:37.114 --> 00:23:42.233
SAM: Rooms are all upstairs. There's individual
rooms for all of us. Mine is at the end of the

00:23:42.233 --> 00:23:50.503
hallway, and is slightly bigger than the rest.
You will find comfortable beds and things in every

00:23:50.503 --> 00:23:55.772
room. The two rooms next to mine are reserved--

00:23:55.772 --> 00:23:57.292
LAURA: For?

00:23:57.292 --> 00:24:02.622
SAM: One is for Pike, the other across the hallway
is for Kaylie, just in case she ever drops by.

00:24:02.622 --> 00:24:03.849
LAURA: That's really sweet.

00:24:03.849 --> 00:24:05.520
TALIESIN: Weird, but sweet.

00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:07.821
SAM: Don't worry, it's not weird.

00:24:07.821 --> 00:24:09.113
TALIESIN: Oh, it's weird.

00:24:09.113 --> 00:24:11.219
SAM: Keeping her close to my heart.

00:24:11.219 --> 00:24:12.838
LAURA: It's super-duper weird. It's really weird.

00:24:12.838 --> 00:24:18.518
SAM: It's not super-duper-- fine, fine, forget it.
When you have a daughter, you can worry about her

00:24:18.518 --> 00:24:20.412
as much as I do.

00:24:20.412 --> 00:24:25.472
MATT: At this point, Keyleth returns with a few
straggler Pyrah tribal members that come in,

00:24:25.472 --> 00:24:31.090
looking about, surprised, bewildered, and some of
them a little freaked out by this transdimensional

00:24:31.090 --> 00:24:36.809
space they just stepped into, TARDIS-style.
Servants come up and start helping them. Some of

00:24:36.809 --> 00:24:40.880
them are still clutching the rocks they were
building as they pass it off and start making

00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:46.335
their way out to various rooms to inspect the
mansion. A few stay back to continue what they

00:24:46.335 --> 00:24:51.456
were already building, ensuring future
establishments to sleep once you guys have left.

00:24:51.456 --> 00:24:55.307
So yeah, you guys are welcome to rest for the
evening, if you'd like.

00:24:55.307 --> 00:24:58.411
LAURA: Is the door protected? Can anybody come in,
or is it only if you invite them?

00:24:58.411 --> 00:24:59.798
SAM: Only invited.

00:24:59.798 --> 00:25:04.728
LAURA: This is the best fucking mansion ever.
How-- I mean-- what?

00:25:04.728 --> 00:25:06.735
TRAVIS: How many times can you do this?

00:25:06.735 --> 00:25:09.890
SAM: Once a day, but that's all we'll need,
right?

00:25:09.890 --> 00:25:16.557
TRAVIS: Shit, yeah. Wait, wait, wait, so if we
were in a fight and things went really south--

00:25:16.557 --> 00:25:18.176
SAM: We could take a break.

00:25:18.176 --> 00:25:21.128
LAURA: (gasps) No, but they could run away, it's
not like time freezes.

00:25:21.128 --> 00:25:22.501
SAM: It does take a while to cast.

00:25:22.501 --> 00:25:23.850
MATT: It takes a minute, so yeah.

00:25:23.850 --> 00:25:24.901
SAM: It takes a minute to cast.

00:25:24.901 --> 00:25:26.421
MARISHA: So it can't be the middle of a battle,
sure.

00:25:26.421 --> 00:25:30.974
LIAM: Is there anything else you can do that you
haven't-- can you make an army of unicorns or a

00:25:30.974 --> 00:25:35.294
giant in a dancing dress, or is this the extent of
what you can do?

00:25:35.294 --> 00:25:38.555
SAM: I'd like to keep a few secrets, if you don't
mind.

00:25:38.555 --> 00:25:40.566
TRAVIS: Can you make fart sounds with your
armpits?

00:25:40.566 --> 00:25:43.407
SAM: Yes. I can bend my thumb all the way back.

00:25:43.407 --> 00:25:52.669
LAURA: I pull out my crystal and I call upon the
great power of Trinket. I choose you.

00:25:52.669 --> 00:26:02.014
MATT: With a flash of deep blue and black light,
Trinket emerges (bear noises).

00:26:02.014 --> 00:26:05.658
LAURA: We have a mansion! You built a Trinket
room.

00:26:05.658 --> 00:26:09.258
SAM: You know what, I totally forgot to build
Trinket a place to sleep.

00:26:09.258 --> 00:26:12.378
LAURA: That's okay, he'll stay in Kaylie's room
for the time being, and then--

00:26:12.378 --> 00:26:14.066
SAM: No no, Kaylie's room is locked.

00:26:14.066 --> 00:26:17.798
LAURA: Pike loves him, I bet he wouldn't mind--

00:26:17.798 --> 00:26:24.003
SAM: Let me just think about this for a second.
There's the third pantry. The third pantry could

00:26:24.003 --> 00:26:30.239
possibly work. It has some just mostly-- no, no,
it's full, we can't use that.

00:26:30.239 --> 00:26:33.556
LAURA: Do you have any rooms with very high
ceilings?

00:26:33.556 --> 00:26:34.979
SAM: The front.

00:26:34.979 --> 00:26:36.912
LAURA: The very front?

00:26:36.912 --> 00:26:38.591
SAM: The front hall.

00:26:38.591 --> 00:26:42.848
LAURA: But I mean somewhere I could put a bed for
myself and Trinket with very high ceilings.

00:26:42.848 --> 00:26:48.591
SAM: All right, yes, there's a whole basement
area. It's a large space.

00:26:48.591 --> 00:26:50.474
LAURA: Wonderful. I'll move my bed down there.

00:26:50.474 --> 00:26:53.375
SAM: It's for training and working with weapons.

00:26:53.375 --> 00:26:55.082
LAURA: That'll be perfect. Trinket needs to
train.

00:26:55.082 --> 00:26:57.596
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'll go down there and I'll stay
with Trinket.

00:26:57.596 --> 00:26:59.709
LAURA: All right.

00:26:59.709 --> 00:27:04.507
TRAVIS: Yeah, I want to train a little, want to
work out a bit.

00:27:04.507 --> 00:27:06.527
LAURA: Totally. I understand.

00:27:06.527 --> 00:27:13.291
TRAVIS: Yep. I need a target, though. Hey, can you
call one of those little ghostly guys over?

00:27:13.291 --> 00:27:14.671
SAM: You can have five of them.

00:27:14.671 --> 00:27:22.270
TRAVIS: Yeah, right, fine. The first one of you
that brings me a cow wins.

00:27:22.270 --> 00:27:30.169
MATT: They all look at each other. "Right away,
sir." And all five of them drift off. A moment

00:27:30.169 --> 00:27:32.165
later, they all return with a spectral cow.

00:27:32.165 --> 00:27:35.009
MARISHA: Like five cows, they each return with
one?

00:27:35.009 --> 00:27:39.665
MATT: No, each one of them is just traveling with
one cow, they've all brought you together one

00:27:39.665 --> 00:27:40.604
spectral cow.

00:27:40.604 --> 00:27:45.018
TRAVIS: It's like a bunch of Mr. Meeseeks with
cows. Do I get to pick a cow? There's just one cow?

00:27:45.018 --> 00:27:46.368
MATT: There's just one cow.

00:27:46.368 --> 00:27:48.359
TRAVIS: Right. So can I touch the cow on the
head?

00:27:48.359 --> 00:27:51.676
MATT: You touch it, and it has weight to it, it
has surface area.

00:27:51.676 --> 00:27:55.301
LAURA: No, we're killing cows, we're killing,
we're killing poor servants--

00:27:55.301 --> 00:27:57.525
TRAVIS: We're not killing anything! And I punch
the cow in the nose.

00:27:57.525 --> 00:27:59.015
SAM: Jesus!

00:27:59.015 --> 00:28:02.681
LAURA: That's so dark!

00:28:02.681 --> 00:28:06.484
TRAVIS: No, look, I'm just seeing what it is.
Stay, Bessie.

00:28:06.484 --> 00:28:10.055
MARISHA: Grog, you just punched a cow in the
face.

00:28:10.055 --> 00:28:11.876
TRAVIS: What, I'm just seeing if it bled. Did the
nose bleed?

00:28:11.876 --> 00:28:12.858
MATT: There is no blood.

00:28:12.858 --> 00:28:13.810
TRAVIS: I punch it again.

00:28:13.810 --> 00:28:15.348
LAURA: Grog! Stop it!

00:28:15.348 --> 00:28:17.063
TRAVIS: I took a really easy punch.

00:28:17.063 --> 00:28:18.731
LAURA: Look, you're hurting it!

00:28:18.731 --> 00:28:19.977
TRAVIS: No, I'm not. Is there any blood?

00:28:19.977 --> 00:28:20.895
MATT: No blood.

00:28:20.895 --> 00:28:22.754
LAURA: Trinket blocks it.

00:28:22.754 --> 00:28:26.672
TRAVIS: Never mind. You know what, I changed my
mind, I don't need a cow. I'm going to go stay in

00:28:26.672 --> 00:28:27.675
a normal room.

00:28:27.675 --> 00:28:32.935
LAURA: No, Grog, actually, I think you should
train for a little bit at least. Just come down to

00:28:32.935 --> 00:28:34.752
the basement and maybe train for a little bit.

00:28:34.752 --> 00:28:36.046
TRAVIS: All right.

00:28:36.046 --> 00:28:41.010
LIAM: I'm sorry, where did that cow come from? I
call one of the servants over to me. Can you get

00:28:41.010 --> 00:28:43.520
anything? Could you get me a small squid?

00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:50.259
MATT: They all look at each other and shake their
head. "No, sir, we have limited resources here.

00:28:50.259 --> 00:28:51.741
"The cow, we happened to have one."

00:28:51.741 --> 00:28:55.854
LIAM: Is that a real cow, Scanlan, or was that
some sort of ghost cow?

00:28:55.854 --> 00:28:57.074
SAM: Ghost cow.

00:28:57.074 --> 00:29:02.515
MATT: At which point the cow disperses.

00:29:02.515 --> 00:29:04.917
TRAVIS: I punched it so hard it exploded.

00:29:04.917 --> 00:29:08.386
TALIESIN: The ghost of a dinner you've already
eaten, come back to haunt you.

00:29:08.386 --> 00:29:15.801
LAURA: I go down to the training room. And I stop
the servant and go, can you bring down a bed for me?

00:29:15.801 --> 00:29:16.878
MATT: Yes.

00:29:16.878 --> 00:29:19.116
LAURA: Thank you. Grog, can we train, please?

00:29:19.116 --> 00:29:21.463
TRAVIS: Yeah. You want to train with me?

00:29:21.463 --> 00:29:24.516
LAURA: Yes, I think I need to train with you,
specifically.

00:29:24.516 --> 00:29:29.033
TRAVIS: All right. Always a good time to get
better, I guess.

00:29:29.033 --> 00:29:31.151
SAM: What's going on over there?

00:29:31.151 --> 00:29:33.220
MARISHA: I don't know.

00:29:33.220 --> 00:29:37.322
MATT: You guys walk out of the foyer into the main
hallway, and at the end to the left you see a

00:29:37.322 --> 00:29:43.685
doorway appear where there wasn't one before. It
opens up on its own, and as you walk you can see

00:29:43.685 --> 00:29:51.912
stairs that lead down and into a basement chamber
that has a sand pit surrounded by brick. There are

00:29:51.912 --> 00:29:57.909
a series of wooden training dummies and various
training accoutrements. There are chains hanging

00:29:57.909 --> 00:30:03.734
from the ceiling for lifting and climbing
exercises. There is a basic set of weapons against

00:30:03.734 --> 00:30:06.814
the weapon rack and a basic set of armor on the
other set.

00:30:06.814 --> 00:30:07.967
SAM: Muscle-ups.

00:30:07.967 --> 00:30:10.005
TRAVIS: Rope climbs.

00:30:10.005 --> 00:30:15.176
TALIESIN: Are we really about to pretend to do
Crossfit? Is that a thing that's actually about to

00:30:15.176 --> 00:30:16.222
happen?

00:30:16.222 --> 00:30:19.034
SAM: Is there a big thing that says WoD on it?

00:30:19.034 --> 00:30:22.205
TRAVIS: Wizard of the Day?

00:30:22.205 --> 00:30:26.803
LAURA: The minute we get downstairs, I start
pawing into the Bag of Holding.

00:30:26.803 --> 00:30:28.069
TRAVIS: What are you doing?

00:30:28.069 --> 00:30:29.528
LAURA: I just need to (grunts).

00:30:29.528 --> 00:30:30.849
(a phone dings)

00:30:30.849 --> 00:30:32.452
SAM: Ooh, how did you do that?

00:30:32.452 --> 00:30:34.086
TRAVIS: That was awesome.

00:30:34.086 --> 00:30:36.648
TRAVIS: What did you grab?

00:30:36.648 --> 00:30:45.427
LAURA: Oh, just this cleaning utensil, is all. Are
we by ourselves? Nobody else came down, right?

00:30:45.427 --> 00:30:47.063
MATT: Just the two of you.

00:30:47.063 --> 00:30:50.566
LAURA: Yeah, I just wanted to do some cleaning
with this broom that I--

00:30:50.566 --> 00:30:51.923
TRAVIS: But this is where you train.

00:30:51.923 --> 00:30:56.592
LAURA: I put it in the Bag of Holding before.
Maybe you can train over there on those dummies,

00:30:56.592 --> 00:31:01.505
and I can just sweep up some of this sand that's
around in this area right here.

00:31:01.505 --> 00:31:03.703
TRAVIS: I thought we were going to train. I
thought we were going to fight.

00:31:03.703 --> 00:31:09.172
LAURA: Yes. Well, Trinket actually wanted some
training with his cannonball. If you will stand

00:31:09.172 --> 00:31:12.561
still so he can run into you a few times, that
would be swell.

00:31:12.561 --> 00:31:19.000
TRAVIS: I feel like there's a problem with this
idea, but I'm not sure what it is, so I do it.

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:24.860
MATT: Okay. Trinket comes along with you and, in a
very confused manner, attempts to train with you

00:31:24.860 --> 00:31:28.920
for a short time. It's been a while since you
wrestled a bear, so it's kind of fun at times.

00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:30.321
LAURA: It's fun, right?

00:31:30.321 --> 00:31:35.044
TRAVIS: Look, I know I usually hit back, but
apparently your mum thinks you can cannonball into

00:31:35.044 --> 00:31:37.565
me, so give it a go.

00:31:37.565 --> 00:31:39.254
LAURA: Go ahead and try, Trinket!

00:31:39.254 --> 00:31:45.794
MATT: Trinket backs up (bear growling), looks over
at you again like, "Are you sure?" Across the sand

00:31:45.794 --> 00:31:48.558
flooring into a giant rolling attack towards you.

00:31:48.558 --> 00:31:49.989
TRAVIS: Oh, fuck.

00:31:49.989 --> 00:31:52.728
MATT: That is going to be... What's Trinket's
attack bonus?

00:31:52.728 --> 00:31:54.885
LAURA: Oh, God, you're really doing it.

00:31:54.885 --> 00:31:55.837
TRAVIS: Yes!

00:31:55.837 --> 00:32:01.631
LAURA: Yes, that's the point of this, to get
Trinket to run into you is the point. His attack

00:32:01.631 --> 00:32:04.142
bonus is plus eight.

00:32:04.142 --> 00:32:06.199
MATT: Plus eight, that's a 23 to hit.

00:32:06.199 --> 00:32:07.447
TRAVIS: Yeah, that hits.

00:32:07.447 --> 00:32:10.604
MATT: You go ahead and take seven points of
bludgeoning damage.

00:32:10.604 --> 00:32:12.570
LAURA: And you're knocked prone!

00:32:12.570 --> 00:32:14.662
MATT: Go ahead and make a strength saving throw.

00:32:14.662 --> 00:32:22.457
TRAVIS: (laughing) Okay. 26.

00:32:22.457 --> 00:32:29.356
MATT: So Trinket rams into you, and you hold firm
and flex. Conversely, the giant bear bounces off,

00:32:29.356 --> 00:32:31.365
stumbles back onto Trinket's butt.

00:32:31.365 --> 00:32:37.547
TRAVIS: That was pretty good! I liked it a lot!

00:32:37.547 --> 00:32:41.186
MATT: Licks you right along the face, beard
cowlicks up a little bit.

00:32:41.186 --> 00:32:46.703
TRAVIS: I think this might be a good look for me.
How do I get it to stay?

00:32:46.703 --> 00:32:50.938
LAURA: While all that is going on, I have a broom
in my hand.

00:32:50.938 --> 00:32:52.062
MATT: You do.

00:32:52.062 --> 00:32:53.950
TRAVIS: I start climbing all over the walls.

00:32:53.950 --> 00:33:00.092
LAURA: I put it between my legs and try to sit on
it.

00:33:00.092 --> 00:33:01.383
MATT: All right.

00:33:01.383 --> 00:33:03.523
SAM: Weirdly, I'm doing the same thing upstairs.

00:33:03.523 --> 00:33:05.507
(laughter)

00:33:05.507 --> 00:33:07.896
TRAVIS: Is one of your servants named Broom?

00:33:07.896 --> 00:33:11.347
LAURA: And I jump in the air a little bit.

00:33:11.347 --> 00:33:12.811
MATT: Hop.

00:33:12.811 --> 00:33:32.994
LAURA: Okay. I say, up! Fly! Lift up! Fatty
Arbuckle! Shenanigans! Ren and Stimpy, I don't know.

00:33:32.994 --> 00:33:34.450
TRAVIS: Rotisserie chicken!

00:33:34.450 --> 00:33:37.589
LAURA: Fuck! Grog.

00:33:37.589 --> 00:33:40.031
TALIESIN: Perhaps it requires a bad Irish accent.

00:33:40.031 --> 00:33:42.051
LAURA: (Irish accent) Fatty Arbuckle!

00:33:42.051 --> 00:33:44.612
(laughter)

00:33:44.612 --> 00:33:46.229
LAURA: Nothing.

00:33:46.229 --> 00:33:47.450
MATT: Nothing.

00:33:47.450 --> 00:33:50.375
TRAVIS: Do you usually yell when you clean?

00:33:50.375 --> 00:33:56.247
LAURA: (groans) I put the broom on the ground. I
walk over and I punch Grog as hard as I can.

00:33:56.247 --> 00:33:58.215
TRAVIS: What was that for?

00:33:58.215 --> 00:34:00.798
MATT: Grog, it's not very strong.

00:34:00.798 --> 00:34:03.400
LAURA: It's not. I'm pretty fucking weak.

00:34:03.400 --> 00:34:07.357
TRAVIS: No, I know, but I like to make her feel
good about it. Ow!

00:34:07.357 --> 00:34:12.089
LAURA: Sorry I hurt you, Grog, I know that was a
very strong punch.

00:34:12.089 --> 00:34:13.625
TRAVIS: I look at Trinket and wink.

00:34:13.625 --> 00:34:16.972
LAURA: Are you guys good? Do you want to keep
training?

00:34:16.972 --> 00:34:18.809
TRAVIS: Yeah, what are you doing?

00:34:18.809 --> 00:34:22.906
LAURA: Nothing! I put the fucking broom back in
the Bag of Holding.

00:34:22.906 --> 00:34:24.898
TRAVIS: You didn't clean very much.

00:34:24.898 --> 00:34:30.216
LAURA: I figured the servants can do it. I walk
upstairs.

00:34:30.216 --> 00:34:31.531
MATT: Okay.

00:34:31.531 --> 00:34:34.261
LIAM: Can Scanlan cast Sad Trombone?

00:34:34.261 --> 00:34:38.247
SAM: We have a music room. I actually have a
trombone.

00:34:38.247 --> 00:34:41.127
MATT: That's true.

00:34:41.127 --> 00:34:44.601
SAM: (sad trombone sound)

00:34:44.601 --> 00:34:48.513
MATT: With Vex not there, Trinket gets a little
antsy and eventually your training session with

00:34:48.513 --> 00:34:53.570
Trinket comes to an end as Trinket goes to seek
Vex. You can finish your wall climbing in solace.

00:34:53.570 --> 00:34:58.384
TRAVIS: All right. I'm good for the night.

00:34:58.384 --> 00:34:59.840
MATT: Okay.

00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:02.120
TRAVIS: I wanted that cow.

00:35:02.120 --> 00:35:04.120
LAURA: I go find Keyleth.

00:35:04.120 --> 00:35:09.762
MARISHA: Okay. I don't know, I'm just chilling.
I'm eating food.

00:35:09.762 --> 00:35:12.248
TRAVIS: Eating food.

00:35:12.248 --> 00:35:14.497
MARISHA: Relaxing.

00:35:14.497 --> 00:35:20.816
LAURA: Hey! Actually-- no, I don't want to talk to
you. Keyleth. What do you know about magical

00:35:20.816 --> 00:35:26.521
things? Like a lot?

00:35:26.521 --> 00:35:35.102
MARISHA: I'm not great at identifying what they
are. I can generally be like, that's magical! But

00:35:35.102 --> 00:35:39.917
I don't know arcane things, only natural-based
magics.

00:35:39.917 --> 00:35:44.603
LAURA: Oh, fuck. Thank you so much!

00:35:44.603 --> 00:35:46.295
MARISHA: Why?

00:35:46.295 --> 00:35:47.922
SAM: Anything I can help you with, Vex?

00:35:47.922 --> 00:35:53.016
LAURA: Scanlan! I might need to talk to you,
dear.

00:35:53.016 --> 00:35:55.899
SAM: Should we retire to my room for this?

00:35:55.899 --> 00:35:58.069
LAURA: Why, yes, we should.

00:35:58.069 --> 00:36:03.760
SAM: (excited gasp) I was not expecting that.

00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:09.047
MARISHA: Keyleth just picks up her plate and
awkwardly leaves.

00:36:09.047 --> 00:36:12.017
LAURA: I go get the broom from the Bag of Holding
again.

00:36:12.017 --> 00:36:16.988
SAM: I run up to my room to make sure that
everything's neat. Light a bunch of candles.

00:36:16.988 --> 00:36:19.187
LAURA: I follow him up and knock on the door.

00:36:19.187 --> 00:36:22.335
MATT: Okay. The door opens up at the first knock.
(creak)

00:36:22.335 --> 00:36:28.756
SAM: I'm lying in bed. Black satin sheets. Oh, I
forgot you were coming!

00:36:28.756 --> 00:36:38.364
LAURA: Wow. Well, darling. I shut the door behind
me. I have a favor to ask you.

00:36:38.364 --> 00:36:43.474
SAM: I should warn you, we're not alone. And I
look over to the five musicians and I ask them to

00:36:43.474 --> 00:36:45.709
strike up a little--

00:36:45.709 --> 00:36:53.432
MATT: A gentle classical piece with a small,
low-timbre brass section comes in.

00:36:53.432 --> 00:36:55.149
SAM: Little bossa nova.

00:36:55.149 --> 00:36:58.872
MATT: Yeah, it's nice. It's not too involved,
doesn't distract you too much.

00:36:58.872 --> 00:37:00.826
LAURA: It's nice mood setting, I like it.

00:37:00.826 --> 00:37:05.756
SAM: Whatever. It's, you know, it's my special
place where I like to come and think about

00:37:05.756 --> 00:37:07.572
philosophy and life.

00:37:07.572 --> 00:37:10.674
LAURA: You're so smart. I've always thought that
about you, that you're very smart.

00:37:10.674 --> 00:37:12.598
SAM: Well, many people do.

00:37:12.598 --> 00:37:15.012
LAURA: Yes. I sit down next to him on the bed.

00:37:15.012 --> 00:37:18.407
SAM: (gulps) It goes up and down a bit. It's a
water bed.

00:37:18.407 --> 00:37:23.629
LAURA: Cozy. Help me!

00:37:23.629 --> 00:37:25.540
SAM: Is that--

00:37:25.540 --> 00:37:27.054
LAURA: What?

00:37:27.054 --> 00:37:29.243
SAM: Did we see that before?

00:37:29.243 --> 00:37:34.485
LAURA: Maybe. Okay, Scanlan, I'm a terrible
person, I know.

00:37:34.485 --> 00:37:36.302
SAM: What did you do?

00:37:36.302 --> 00:37:41.078
LAURA: I took a broom from a poor, poor
dragonborn.

00:37:41.078 --> 00:37:44.063
SAM: You took Gern's magical broom?

00:37:44.063 --> 00:37:45.135
LAURA: Maybe.

00:37:45.135 --> 00:37:46.605
SAM: Oh my gods.

00:37:46.605 --> 00:37:50.301
LAURA: I know, I'm sorry, I know, I'm terrible,
and now it won't work and it was pointless and I

00:37:50.301 --> 00:37:51.903
want it to work. Help me.

00:37:51.903 --> 00:37:53.047
SAM: Because it flies?

00:37:53.047 --> 00:37:54.580
LAURA: Because it flies, Scanlan.

00:37:54.580 --> 00:37:56.431
SAM: What is it with you and flying?

00:37:56.431 --> 00:38:01.574
LAURA: I don't know, there's just something about
being up there in the air that makes me feel alive

00:38:01.574 --> 00:38:03.732
in a way that I've never felt before.

00:38:03.732 --> 00:38:05.436
SAM: I could make you fly.

00:38:05.436 --> 00:38:09.375
LAURA: Okay. Wait-- Oh, you mean. With your cube.

00:38:09.375 --> 00:38:11.748
SAM: Yes, that's right.

00:38:11.748 --> 00:38:14.941
LAURA: I'd rather you do it with this broom,
actually. And not in any weird way, just to be

00:38:14.941 --> 00:38:18.418
able to help me make the broom fly. Do you know
how to do that?

00:38:18.418 --> 00:38:25.671
SAM: I will try. I will examine the broom and make
some sort of check on it.

00:38:25.671 --> 00:38:27.018
MATT: Make an arcana check.

00:38:27.018 --> 00:38:28.591
SAM: Oh, that's not good.

00:38:28.591 --> 00:38:30.545
TRAVIS: Should've come to me for that.

00:38:30.545 --> 00:38:31.937
LAURA: Oh, no!

00:38:31.937 --> 00:38:33.445
TALIESIN: It's a number.

00:38:33.445 --> 00:38:34.566
SAM: 14.

00:38:34.566 --> 00:38:41.573
MATT: 14. Okay. Looking over the broom, you can
tell it's enchanted. There are runes along the

00:38:41.573 --> 00:38:49.855
sides of the broom. You do gather from the nature
of the enchantment that it is an item that

00:38:49.855 --> 00:38:58.846
requires a spoken phrase from the wielder to
initiate its magic. Short of an Identify spell,

00:38:58.846 --> 00:39:03.238
you would probably have to guess. If you know the
Identify spell, that would be a way for you to.

00:39:03.238 --> 00:39:08.188
SAM: I don't. Can I examine it to see if there's
any markings, any hidden anything on it?

00:39:08.188 --> 00:39:12.301
MATT: Make an intelligence check. Or, you know
what, this would be specifically investigation.

00:39:12.301 --> 00:39:13.815
Investigation check.

00:39:13.815 --> 00:39:15.901
SAM: Investigation. 21.

00:39:15.901 --> 00:39:23.611
MATT: You do notice that many of the runes
intricately carved on the side of the broom are--

00:39:23.611 --> 00:39:30.890
they're part of the enchantment; however, there is
a certain phrase that is not part of the

00:39:30.890 --> 00:39:37.524
enchantment. It's scrawled into and very cleverly
hidden amongst the broom. It is not Common. What

00:39:37.524 --> 00:39:38.900
languages do you know?

00:39:38.900 --> 00:39:42.792
SAM: Common, Gnome. Pig Latin.

00:39:42.792 --> 00:39:46.140
MATT: It is not a language you recognize.

00:39:46.140 --> 00:39:48.831
LAURA: I speak Elvish, Draconic, Undercommon?

00:39:48.831 --> 00:39:51.162
SAM: You don't see the words, though.

00:39:51.162 --> 00:39:52.514
LAURA: But you saw it.

00:39:52.514 --> 00:39:57.468
SAM: There's some words here that might be a clue
to the code word. Basically, we need to find the

00:39:57.468 --> 00:39:59.549
code word. What do we know about Gern?

00:39:59.549 --> 00:40:02.367
LAURA: Well, I tried Fatty Arbuckle. I thought
maybe that was something.

00:40:02.367 --> 00:40:04.185
SAM: Did you try the others? Coral? Carol?

00:40:04.185 --> 00:40:05.298
LAURA: Coral. Carol.

00:40:05.298 --> 00:40:07.312
SAM: You probably need to hold it.

00:40:07.312 --> 00:40:11.427
LAURA: What was the... Oh. Coral! Carol! I don't
remember the other one's name.

00:40:11.427 --> 00:40:12.781
SAM: I don't either.

00:40:12.781 --> 00:40:14.579
LAURA: Stimpy? Was it Stimpy? It was Stimpy!

00:40:14.579 --> 00:40:18.979
SAM: Try: On Coral! On Carol! On Stimpy! On Fatty
Arbuckle!

00:40:18.979 --> 00:40:21.986
LAURA: Wait, but what does the word say? Where's
the word?

00:40:21.986 --> 00:40:23.342
SAM: I can't read the words.

00:40:23.342 --> 00:40:24.819
LAURA: Can I find it? What is it?

00:40:24.819 --> 00:40:26.045
MATT: Do you point it out to her?

00:40:26.045 --> 00:40:27.194
SAM: I point it out to her.

00:40:27.194 --> 00:40:28.036
LAURA: What is it?

00:40:28.036 --> 00:40:29.189
MATT: It is Draconic.

00:40:29.189 --> 00:40:30.281
LAURA: What does it say?

00:40:30.281 --> 00:40:35.398
MATT: It's archaic Draconic. It's from the base
root of the language, which is one of the oldest

00:40:35.398 --> 00:40:42.709
languages in civilization. It spells out,
phonetically, the word for candle.

00:40:42.709 --> 00:40:48.375
LAURA: That's smart. (hacking spit)

00:40:48.375 --> 00:40:54.862
MATT: At which point, the broom jumps up in your
hands, and almost lifts you off the bed for a

00:40:54.862 --> 00:40:56.777
second, and you catch it and hold it back down.

00:40:56.777 --> 00:41:06.127
LAURA: (singing) Something has changed within me!
Oh my God! Oh my God. Scanlan.

00:41:06.127 --> 00:41:12.991
SAM: Weirdly, you are not the first floating chick
I've had in my bed. But that is amazing! You're

00:41:12.991 --> 00:41:13.999
flying!

00:41:13.999 --> 00:41:17.991
LAURA: I hug him. I hug him as hard as I've ever
hugged Scanlan. I love you so much. You're my

00:41:17.991 --> 00:41:21.964
favorite person in the entire universe right now.
I owe you--

00:41:21.964 --> 00:41:25.518
SAM: Nope. You owe me nothing. That's what friends
are for.

00:41:25.518 --> 00:41:27.860
LAURA: I love you.

00:41:27.860 --> 00:41:30.181
SAM: I shake her little elf hand.

00:41:30.181 --> 00:41:32.685
MATT: It's a pretty big elf hand compared to your
tiny gnome hand.

00:41:32.685 --> 00:41:33.806
SAM: Okay.

00:41:33.806 --> 00:41:38.222
LAURA: I sit on it. How high are the ceilings in
here?

00:41:38.222 --> 00:41:40.236
MATT: How high are the ceilings in your room?

00:41:40.236 --> 00:41:42.430
SAM: As high as they can be on the top floor.

00:41:42.430 --> 00:41:45.722
MATT: For this room, because it is an
extradimensional space, this room is probably a

00:41:45.722 --> 00:41:50.933
good 50 feet high. High ceilings, with drapery.
It's so garish.

00:41:50.933 --> 00:41:52.284
LAURA: Can I sit side-saddle on it?

00:41:52.284 --> 00:41:53.568
MATT: Yeah.

00:41:53.568 --> 00:41:56.391
LAURA: (hacking spit) I don't remember how I said
it before.

00:41:56.391 --> 00:41:57.920
SAM: You're going to have to remember that now.

00:41:57.920 --> 00:41:59.810
MATT: Better write that down. (hacking spit)

00:41:59.810 --> 00:42:03.209
LAURA: Why didn't I choose something more fun to
say?

00:42:03.209 --> 00:42:10.475
MATT: Welcome to D&amp;amp;D. As the words emit from your
mouth, the broom takes off, and you have to aim it

00:42:10.475 --> 00:42:16.040
a bit. You start going around in circles, slowly
rising up towards the roof of the room.

00:42:16.040 --> 00:42:20.639
LAURA: Yay, this is awesome! I'm really high!

00:42:20.639 --> 00:42:24.691
SAM: I instruct the band to start playing Flight
of the Bumblebee.

00:42:24.691 --> 00:42:29.021
MATT: (whistling)

00:42:29.021 --> 00:42:32.707
LAURA: Oh my gosh! Can I take my hands off?

00:42:32.707 --> 00:42:37.867
MATT: You do, and you start going, "Whoa!" Go
ahead and make a dexterity check.

00:42:37.867 --> 00:42:41.951
LAURA: Oh my God. I probably should have been
lower to the ground when I said that. Okay, that's

00:42:41.951 --> 00:42:44.220
fine. Oh, I'm still exhausted!

00:42:44.220 --> 00:42:45.394
MATT: Yep.

00:42:45.394 --> 00:42:47.547
SAM: Oh, shit.

00:42:47.547 --> 00:42:50.337
LAURA: 20.

00:42:50.337 --> 00:42:54.721
MATT: That's fine. You're fine. A really bad roll
might have had a circumstance, but you manage to

00:42:54.721 --> 00:42:58.301
catch yourself on the broom in time and, okay.
You're getting the hang of it. It's still not

00:42:58.301 --> 00:43:01.651
something you're used to, but it's fine.

00:43:01.651 --> 00:43:03.953
LAURA: Can I point it down towards the ground and
get lower?

00:43:03.953 --> 00:43:08.300
MATT: You do. And you take a few minutes to figure
out the pitch and wobble of it, and it's less of a

00:43:08.300 --> 00:43:14.873
directional flight, more than it is a combination
of how you hold the front of the broom and

00:43:14.873 --> 00:43:20.304
concentrate on its direction. But nevertheless, a
few moments pass, and you get the hang of it.

00:43:20.304 --> 00:43:24.743
LAURA: Oh. My. God. This is the best day of my
entire life.

00:43:24.743 --> 00:43:26.078
SAM: You look great up there.

00:43:26.078 --> 00:43:27.539
LAURA: Thank you. Thank you.

00:43:27.539 --> 00:43:31.104
SAM: But you should not have stolen that!

00:43:31.104 --> 00:43:32.516
LAURA: Oh, I know, I know, it's terrible!

00:43:32.516 --> 00:43:34.003
SAM: He was our friend! He helped us!

00:43:34.003 --> 00:43:36.019
LAURA: How bad of a person am I? I'm a horrible
person!

00:43:36.019 --> 00:43:38.574
SAM: We should do something to repay the debt!

00:43:38.574 --> 00:43:41.835
LAURA: Well, I tried. I was going to give him a
lot of dragon scales, and he wandered away!

00:43:41.835 --> 00:43:44.429
SAM: We can't possibly find him now.

00:43:44.429 --> 00:43:47.361
LAURA: Well, how do I help him? Because I feel
terrible.

00:43:47.361 --> 00:43:53.321
SAM: If we can't help him, you're going to have to
help someone else to make up for the lost karma.

00:43:53.321 --> 00:43:58.192
LAURA: I will help as many people as I can while
I'm flying through the air.

00:43:58.192 --> 00:44:05.762
SAM: Perhaps I will pick someone for you to help
someday. To repay us both.

00:44:05.762 --> 00:44:07.443
LAURA: I think that's a deal, Scanlan.

00:44:07.443 --> 00:44:09.370
SAM: All right. I will mark that down.

00:44:09.370 --> 00:44:14.327
LAURA: What are you, like, a hag now? I sit on it,
and I open the door, and I fly through the

00:44:14.327 --> 00:44:15.326
doorway.

00:44:15.326 --> 00:44:19.485
MATT: She drifts out of the room. The door (slam)
shuts behind her.

00:44:19.485 --> 00:44:21.589
MARISHA: You're going to be one of those Segway
assholes now!

00:44:21.589 --> 00:44:22.923
TRAVIS: Yes, totally!

00:44:22.923 --> 00:44:30.882
MATT: You lean back in your bed, on your fine,
black silken sheets, with Flight of the Bumblebees

00:44:30.882 --> 00:44:32.689
still blaring by the fireplace.

00:44:32.689 --> 00:44:35.094
SAM: All right, guys, it didn't work, you can go.

00:44:35.094 --> 00:44:41.162
MATT: They all get up. The music stops. And they
all slowly drift out of the room, one by one.

00:44:41.162 --> 00:44:44.635
Fireplace still crackling.

00:44:44.635 --> 00:44:46.216
SAM: It's nice in here.

00:44:46.216 --> 00:44:49.976
TALIESIN: I'm sitting wherever there's a lounge of
any kind. I'm working in the sketchbook. Working

00:44:49.976 --> 00:44:51.469
on things.

00:44:51.469 --> 00:44:52.843
MATT: Not a worry.

00:44:52.843 --> 00:44:58.044
MARISHA: I'll be reading my alchemy book, because
I have had so little time to catch up on my

00:44:58.044 --> 00:44:58.920
reading.

00:44:58.920 --> 00:45:00.362
TALIESIN: We never talk anymore, do we?

00:45:00.362 --> 00:45:01.681
MARISHA: We never do.

00:45:01.681 --> 00:45:04.203
TALIESIN: Mmm.

00:45:04.203 --> 00:45:09.041
LAURA: I'm so happy! It's the best!

00:45:09.041 --> 00:45:10.785
MATT: So good!

00:45:10.785 --> 00:45:15.601
LAURA: I'm going to try to sleep. It's going to be
really, really hard because I'm so excited, but I

00:45:15.601 --> 00:45:17.288
really need to get some rest!

00:45:17.288 --> 00:45:18.579
MARISHA: Did you feed the dog?

00:45:18.579 --> 00:45:24.479
TALIESIN: Today? I don't know.

00:45:24.479 --> 00:45:28.310
MATT: So, anyone want to do anything else? You
going to go rest for the evening?

00:45:28.310 --> 00:45:30.330
TRAVIS: I rest.

00:45:30.330 --> 00:45:31.272
TALIESIN: I'm good.

00:45:31.272 --> 00:45:36.362
MATT: All right. You all eventually find your ways
to your rooms, happy and comfortable in the fact

00:45:36.362 --> 00:45:44.172
that no one has to take watch for this night. As
you all get to bed, a few hours into the evening,

00:45:44.172 --> 00:45:50.457
Keyleth, you are just starting to doze off when
you hear a knock at the door.

00:45:50.457 --> 00:45:53.710
MARISHA: (gasps awake) Scanlan?

00:45:53.710 --> 00:45:56.067
MATT: You open the door?

00:45:56.067 --> 00:45:58.181
MARISHA: On my door?

00:45:58.181 --> 00:46:00.171
MATT: On your door.

00:46:00.171 --> 00:46:03.346
MARISHA: Who is it?

00:46:03.346 --> 00:46:08.773
MATT: "Keyleth, it is Cerkonos. Please open up. I
wish to speak with you."

00:46:08.773 --> 00:46:10.859
MARISHA: I open the door.

00:46:10.859 --> 00:46:18.894
MATT: Okay. Cerkonos comes in. The first thing you
notice-- previously, you had seen what was his

00:46:18.894 --> 00:46:26.127
burned-off arm at the shoulder. You can now see
the flesh is extended and is currently very slowly

00:46:26.127 --> 00:46:32.108
in the process of regenerating his lost arm. And
it catches you off-guard for a moment, and he puts

00:46:32.108 --> 00:46:38.958
his hand up and says, "Sorry, it is not very
presentable." And he still keeps his hand over it,

00:46:38.958 --> 00:46:51.033
slightly embarrassed by the mid-regenerative state
of it. "I'm sorry to have disturbed you, I come as

00:46:51.033 --> 00:46:56.771
"unease has taken my mind." And he enters the room
and closes the door behind him. "May we sit?"

00:46:56.771 --> 00:46:58.928
MARISHA: Of course, please, Cerkonos.

00:46:58.928 --> 00:47:02.540
MATT: He goes over and takes one of the nearby
chairs and sets it down, places one across from

00:47:02.540 --> 00:47:12.510
him for you to sit, gestures with his one arm.
Sits down. "I would not speak with those I do not

00:47:12.510 --> 00:47:20.513
"trust. And I have seen your purity of soul,
Keyleth. So I come to you with these concerns."

00:47:20.513 --> 00:47:31.133
His eyes trail off for a moment in the distance,
and he gathers his thoughts and his words. "Four

00:47:31.133 --> 00:47:44.207
"years ago, a young woman came to Pyrah for
redemption. A lost girl, cast out and wishing for

00:47:44.207 --> 00:47:56.724
"acceptance. We, as we do with outcasts, took her
in, taught her. And in time, called her one of our

00:47:56.724 --> 00:48:12.099
"own, one of the Pyrah. In recent months, she began
to grow distant, taking to staying in the

00:48:12.099 --> 00:48:22.851
"Cindergrove unattended for days at a time. One
afternoon, the mountain moved, angry with shifting

00:48:22.851 --> 00:48:34.666
"fires. We felt a disturbance in the Gate, and when
we went to investigate, there she was, commanding

00:48:34.666 --> 00:48:37.362
"powers we did not know she had."

00:48:37.362 --> 00:48:42.634
MARISHA: What kind of powers? Beyond those of
druidic nature?

00:48:42.634 --> 00:48:55.260
MATT: "These were the magics taken by man who defied
the gods. These were the purest of ancient arcane

00:48:55.260 --> 00:49:05.716
"threads. We watched as she reached out and tore
open the Gate. She laughed as we called out to

00:49:05.716 --> 00:49:11.523
"stop. But something terrible emerged from that
wounded sky."

00:49:11.523 --> 00:49:13.604
MARISHA: Thordak?

00:49:13.604 --> 00:49:21.445
MATT: "This dragon you speak of, yes. I defended
all that I could, but the power was too great, and

00:49:21.445 --> 00:49:31.584
"unconsciousness took me. I awoke to my people in
tatters, the fires untethered, and this terrible

00:49:31.584 --> 00:49:47.505
"girl gone. It is both embarrassing and greatly
alarming that we could be infiltrated by such an

00:49:47.505 --> 00:49:54.635
"entity. That blame falls on me, as the headmaster,
for not seeing this earlier."

00:49:54.635 --> 00:50:01.281
MARISHA: You acted within the good nature of our
people, there's nothing wrong with that. How old

00:50:01.281 --> 00:50:04.398
was this girl when she came to you? And how old is
she now?

00:50:04.398 --> 00:50:07.018
MATT: "When she came to us she couldn't be more
than 15."

00:50:07.018 --> 00:50:11.076
MARISHA: So she's 19, 20?

00:50:11.076 --> 00:50:21.167
MATT: "Perhaps. She did not seem to blossom into
womanhood as many do. We considered her more of a

00:50:21.167 --> 00:50:24.170
"runt of her litter, if you will."

00:50:24.170 --> 00:50:29.272
MARISHA: And what was her race?

00:50:29.272 --> 00:50:32.171
MATT: "She seemed human."

00:50:32.171 --> 00:50:35.695
MARISHA: She seemed human? What do you mean?

00:50:35.695 --> 00:50:46.290
MATT: "We take many forms as druids. If she was
indeed human, at that age, to command such power...

00:50:46.290 --> 00:50:48.892
"I do not know her true nature."

00:50:48.892 --> 00:50:51.639
MARISHA: What was her name?

00:50:51.639 --> 00:51:05.615
MATT: "Her name was Raishan. Anyway. I wish to
tell you this because my heart is heavy with

00:51:05.615 --> 00:51:21.082
"guilt, and I want you to know that even in places
of comfort, family, be careful, keep those you

00:51:21.082 --> 00:51:30.289
"know you can trust close. Be mindful of those that
promise aid when they have not proven themselves.

00:51:30.289 --> 00:51:35.762
"If you have an instinct, follow it."

00:51:35.762 --> 00:51:40.345
MARISHA: Are you referring to something in
particular, Cerkonos?

00:51:40.345 --> 00:51:49.578
MATT: "I just do not wish you to make the same
mistake I did. Anyway, I thank you for your

00:51:49.578 --> 00:51:53.994
"companions and you coming to our aid. It shall not
be forgotten."

00:51:53.994 --> 00:52:05.054
MARISHA: I shall keep an ear open for the name
Raishan. If I hear anything about her, I'll send word.

00:52:05.054 --> 00:52:13.391
MATT: "Should you need the aid of the Pyrah,
though we are not much at now, come find me. I

00:52:13.391 --> 00:52:19.283
"look forward for to you bringing Zephrah together.
You will make a fine leader."

00:52:19.283 --> 00:52:26.936
MARISHA: Thank you, Cerkonos. And I'm glad that
you're still with us.

00:52:26.936 --> 00:52:29.306
MATT: "Kaitiaki, Keyleth."

00:52:29.306 --> 00:52:30.820
MARISHA: Kaitiaki, Cerkonos.

00:52:30.820 --> 00:52:32.472
MATT: Cerkonos leaves.

00:52:32.472 --> 00:52:40.930
MARISHA: And I start poring through my notes for
the name Raishan, because Keyleth believes she has

00:52:40.930 --> 00:52:47.094
heard that name before as one of the dragons,
correct? One of the white--

00:52:47.094 --> 00:52:48.407
LAURA: (whispering) It's the green one.

00:52:48.407 --> 00:52:51.110
MARISHA: --the green one. Okay, okay.

00:52:51.110 --> 00:52:52.830
MATT: That is true.

00:52:52.830 --> 00:52:57.549
MARISHA: Do I have any other reference, would I
know anything else about that?

00:52:57.549 --> 00:53:04.490
MATT: That's all you know, is the name
Raishan was used when the Conclave attacked Emon.

00:53:04.490 --> 00:53:09.043
And it seemed the name belonged to the green
dragon that initiated the assault where you guys were.

00:53:09.043 --> 00:53:11.248
MARISHA: Fucking bitch.

00:53:11.248 --> 00:53:17.393
MATT: So, these thoughts echoing through your
mind--

00:53:17.393 --> 00:53:20.346
TALIESIN: Streets will run green with revenge!

00:53:20.346 --> 00:53:21.761
MARISHA: Yes, they will!

00:53:21.761 --> 00:53:27.888
MATT: You sleep, but uneasily, as all of these
realizations swirl in your head. Eventually sleep

00:53:27.888 --> 00:53:38.888
takes you, but it is not an easy sleep. Just
enough to function. Barely. Vax. As you yourself

00:53:38.888 --> 00:53:45.499
have attempted to stave off sleep for many days,
pushing yourself to your limits, it finally takes

00:53:45.499 --> 00:53:54.718
its toll, and you drift off into a deep, deep
slumber. In that slumber, you find yourself in

00:53:54.718 --> 00:54:07.223
darkness. Echoes of a distant voice, muffled, as
if underwater. Crash. The darkness is shattered

00:54:07.223 --> 00:54:14.944
into a thousand black feathers, and you find
yourself falling, falling. Falling towards what

00:54:14.944 --> 00:54:22.665
seems to be a tangled net of glowing threads.
You're afraid you might impact at such a speed,

00:54:22.665 --> 00:54:31.617
but before you do, you slow and come to a stop
before this extremely prominent glowing weave,

00:54:31.617 --> 00:54:41.319
this infinite tapestry in all directions. You are
uncertain of the meaning of this moment when a

00:54:41.319 --> 00:54:49.155
large cold hand reaches past your shoulder and
grasps a thread right before your face, this

00:54:49.155 --> 00:54:56.497
singular glowing thread, pulsing with light like a
heartbeat. You follow the arm over your shoulder,

00:54:56.497 --> 00:55:06.155
and glance up directly into the massive form of
the Raven Queen: porcelain face like a mask, long

00:55:06.155 --> 00:55:15.436
jet-black hair, her body encasing you like a
physical cage. Your eyes follow the arm back to

00:55:15.436 --> 00:55:23.551
the thread that she carries between her massive
fingers. She tugs it, ever so gently, and it

00:55:23.551 --> 00:55:33.606
causes waves to ripple through the tapestry into
infinity. Her voice fills your mind, both calm but

00:55:33.606 --> 00:55:47.968
cold. "This is you, my champion. You are
fate-touched. The choice is yours. Rebirth or

00:55:47.968 --> 00:56:01.930
"ruin. Maker or martyr. Conqueror, tyrant, or
nothing." She plucks the thread from the weave,

00:56:01.930 --> 00:56:07.300
snapping it. You plummet into the hole left behind
it, falling faster and faster into the dark.

00:56:07.300 --> 00:56:12.231
Losing control, you turn around and see the Raven
Queen, disappearing into the distance, growing

00:56:12.231 --> 00:56:19.637
smaller and smaller, until suddenly, nothing.

00:56:19.637 --> 00:56:26.302
Grog. You fall into a deep snore, heavy, heavy
snore, after drinking the wine, climbing up walls,

00:56:26.302 --> 00:56:28.602
you've had an exhausting day of--

00:56:28.602 --> 00:56:30.022
TRAVIS: Sleeping in the sand pit.

00:56:30.022 --> 00:56:32.561
MATT: Okay, you are face down.

00:56:32.561 --> 00:56:34.851
TRAVIS: Like a beach, just (snore).

00:56:34.851 --> 00:56:38.988
MATT: It's great. You've drooled into the sand,
and it's clustered around your beard. It's

00:56:38.988 --> 00:56:46.985
horrifying. But in the middle of snoring, this
restful sleep also comes into your mind, and you

00:56:46.985 --> 00:56:52.501
find yourself walking alone. A long hallway, into
blinding light. You have to cover your face, it's

00:56:52.501 --> 00:57:00.499
so bright, but you push forward because you know
there's only one way to go. You cannot see, but

00:57:00.499 --> 00:57:06.688
you can hear around you and sense the hallway's
ended, and there's now space around you. You

00:57:06.688 --> 00:57:14.181
cannot see, but you sense an arena, gladiatorial
in nature. You can hear the distant whisper and

00:57:14.181 --> 00:57:16.881
hum of crowds cheering.

00:57:16.881 --> 00:57:18.871
SAM: Phillip! Phillip!

00:57:18.871 --> 00:57:28.567
MATT: You sense others around you, closing in
suddenly. A voice, ever-whispering in your ear,

00:57:28.567 --> 00:57:36.034
says, "Release me." Still blinded, eyes closed, on
instinct, you pull the cold, dark blade from your

00:57:36.034 --> 00:57:41.771
back and swing wide, over and over again, feeling
the shuddering shock of each impact, your strength

00:57:41.771 --> 00:57:47.778
matched by the razor-like edge of your weapon,
cleaving down any who would approach. The high of

00:57:47.778 --> 00:57:52.273
adrenaline is incredible, and you laugh aloud at
the sheer thrill of your own power.

00:57:52.273 --> 00:57:53.986
TRAVIS: (laughs triumphantly)

00:57:53.986 --> 00:57:59.834
MATT: The light subsides and your vision returns.
You look to see hundreds of people dead at your

00:57:59.834 --> 00:58:13.863
feet. Farmers, children. You see Pike, motionless,
cast among the carnage. You want to scream, but

00:58:13.863 --> 00:58:20.224
instead you laugh, against your own judgment and
intent, like you're locked within yourself and

00:58:20.224 --> 00:58:27.153
have no control. And as you look up from the pile
of corpses at your feet, you see a towering figure

00:58:27.153 --> 00:58:37.287
before you, cast in furs and bone, standing even a
head and a half's height above you, is Kevdak,

00:58:37.287 --> 00:58:48.316
looking down at you with pride. The entire herd
steps up beside him, staring at you atop your

00:58:48.316 --> 00:59:01.509
throne of corpses, and the herd kneels. Kevdak
bows, looking up at you, smiling. "You. You have

00:59:01.509 --> 00:59:07.833
"finally made me proud, Grog."

00:59:07.833 --> 00:59:16.854
You wake up (gasp), spittle and sand and grit
mashed against your face. Who knows how long it's

00:59:16.854 --> 00:59:25.657
been, but it's been a while since you've had a
dream, let alone one like that.

00:59:25.657 --> 00:59:30.106
Now, as you all eventually come to in the morning,
having your evening's rest, you've recovered your

00:59:30.106 --> 00:59:35.899
hit points, your spells, all of the usual good
stuff, in a fantastic mansion. Maybe not the most

00:59:35.899 --> 00:59:41.232
fantastic rest for some of you, but a fantastic
mansion. You all eventually find your way to the

00:59:41.232 --> 00:59:46.887
breakfast nook, which is as extravagant as you
would imagine a Scanlan-based

00:59:46.887 --> 00:59:48.671
breakfast nook would be.

00:59:48.671 --> 00:59:53.793
TALIESIN: Green marble, silver tiling. Sorry,
carry on.

00:59:53.793 --> 00:59:55.178
MARISHA: Crystal chandelier.

00:59:55.178 --> 00:59:56.683
SAM: Waffle presses.

00:59:56.683 --> 01:00:01.233
MATT: There's a fantastic breakfast feast already
prepared, rows of servants along the walls waiting

01:00:01.233 --> 01:00:07.605
eagerly to attend to you guys as you sit down,
pouring fresh juices. It smells fantastic, and

01:00:07.605 --> 01:00:09.906
most of you look rested, except for a handful.

01:00:09.906 --> 01:00:14.357
SAM: Eat! Drink!

01:00:14.357 --> 01:00:16.821
LAURA: I come skipping into the room, for sure.

01:00:16.821 --> 01:00:18.732
TALIESIN: Good morning.

01:00:18.732 --> 01:00:20.766
SAM: You're looking delighted and delightful.

01:00:20.766 --> 01:00:23.185
LAURA: What a beautiful day it is!

01:00:23.185 --> 01:00:26.610
MARISHA: Do you have wine and ale at the breakfast
buffet?

01:00:26.610 --> 01:00:28.755
SAM: Sure, sure. There's mimosas, there's--

01:00:28.755 --> 01:00:30.171
MARISHA: I'll have a mimosa.

01:00:30.171 --> 01:00:32.470
TALIESIN: You've never heard of breakfast beer?

01:00:32.470 --> 01:00:38.383
SAM: Breakfast beer? Sure. There's milk from a cow
with a broken nose.

01:00:38.416 --> 01:00:45.995
LAURA: Oh, that is so sad. Can you heal it? Can it
be healed?

01:00:45.995 --> 01:00:50.754
SAM: It'll be fine. When we leave this place, all
these people die, anyway.

01:00:50.754 --> 01:00:54.298
TALIESIN: You're supposed to churn the milk after
it leaves the cow.

01:00:54.298 --> 01:00:59.162
LAURA: Wait, Scanlan, can we store things here, or
does it all disappear as soon as we leave?

01:00:59.162 --> 01:01:00.876
SAM: I don't know.

01:01:00.876 --> 01:01:02.463
MATT: You haven't tried it before.

01:01:02.463 --> 01:01:05.087
LAURA: We should leave something inconsequential.

01:01:05.087 --> 01:01:08.801
SAM: We'll leave Trinket, and then we'll try it
again, and if Trinket's still here, we'll know.

01:01:08.801 --> 01:01:11.536
MARISHA: Schrodinger's Trinket.

01:01:11.536 --> 01:01:13.992
SAM: It's just-- no?

01:01:13.992 --> 01:01:14.950
LAURA: No.

01:01:14.950 --> 01:01:17.062
SAM: All right. We'll leave the broom and see if
it's still here.

01:01:17.062 --> 01:01:18.604
LAURA: No, no, no, let's not.

01:01:18.604 --> 01:01:19.797
TALIESIN: What broom?

01:01:19.797 --> 01:01:23.769
SAM: Oh, Vex, is there something you'd like to
admit to the rest of the group? They'll see you

01:01:23.769 --> 01:01:25.699
use it sooner or later.

01:01:25.699 --> 01:01:31.199
MATT: You hear a voice go (grunt). Trinket's over
there, face covered in breakfast food, trying to

01:01:31.199 --> 01:01:36.620
sit at one of the edges of the table like a
person, the actual bowing of the wooden bench that

01:01:36.620 --> 01:01:39.650
Trinket's on, you hear the creaking as he moves
around in it.

01:01:39.650 --> 01:01:51.053
LAURA: Thank you, Scanlan, for making me feel...
So, guess what! I can fly! A-plus!

01:01:51.053 --> 01:01:53.356
TALIESIN: How did that happen?

01:01:53.356 --> 01:02:01.563
MARISHA: I had a really weird night, too. What
happened in your... because, I mean, flight?

01:02:01.563 --> 01:02:03.561
LAURA: Did you have a weird night? Do you want to
tell us about it?

01:02:03.561 --> 01:02:05.152
MARISHA: No, I want to hear about your night.

01:02:05.152 --> 01:02:06.994
TALIESIN: I think you go first.

01:02:06.994 --> 01:02:09.914
MARISHA: I want to learn how you fly.

01:02:09.914 --> 01:02:14.734
LAURA: Okay. So I sort of kind of tricked Gern,
I'm a terrible person.

01:02:14.734 --> 01:02:16.433
SAM: Gern, our friend.

01:02:16.433 --> 01:02:18.443
TRAVIS: You swallowed that last part. What did you
say?

01:02:18.443 --> 01:02:27.278
LAURA: I sort of kind of, this is the worst...
took something that wasn't mine? In a way. I mean,

01:02:27.278 --> 01:02:32.789
I was holding on to it, and then I slipped, and it
fell into the Bag of Holding.

01:02:32.789 --> 01:02:35.087
TRAVIS: Why is that bad?

01:02:35.087 --> 01:02:36.755
TALIESIN: You stole from a candlemaker?

01:02:36.755 --> 01:02:38.491
LAURA: I stole from a necromancer.

01:02:38.491 --> 01:02:41.987
TALIESIN: Slash candlemaker.

01:02:41.987 --> 01:02:45.764
LAURA: Yes. No, he was a nice guy.

01:02:45.764 --> 01:02:50.780
SAM: I think we should hear Vax's opinion of this.

01:02:50.780 --> 01:02:53.818
MARISHA: Vax, I think you were a bad influence.

01:02:53.818 --> 01:03:02.412
LIAM: I can't judge. I've done my share in the past. I
thought you were a little overly nice to him.

01:03:02.461 --> 01:03:04.743
TALIESIN: I mean, to be fair, we did steal a
carpet once.

01:03:04.743 --> 01:03:05.767
LAURA: We did.

01:03:05.767 --> 01:03:07.198
SAM: Did we steal that? I thought it was just a--

01:03:07.198 --> 01:03:09.246
MARISHA: We used that in an emergency.

01:03:09.246 --> 01:03:10.549
TRAVIS: We commandeered it.

01:03:10.549 --> 01:03:12.518
LAURA: We took it, Scanlan, and we didn't tell
Allura.

01:03:12.518 --> 01:03:14.208
TALIESIN: And then never gave it back.

01:03:14.208 --> 01:03:15.370
SAM: That's true.

01:03:15.370 --> 01:03:16.364
LAURA: We're terrible.

01:03:16.364 --> 01:03:20.142
LIAM: I don't think any of us can judge you,
Vex'ahlia, but it does strike me as a little bit

01:03:20.142 --> 01:03:23.212
odd, if nothing else.

01:03:23.212 --> 01:03:29.500
LAURA: I know. I know, I'm afraid these rogue
tendencies I've been learning from you, brother,

01:03:29.500 --> 01:03:35.903
maybe rubbed off a little bit. No, I just, I know
I shouldn't have.

01:03:35.903 --> 01:03:37.579
TRAVIS: I don't care.

01:03:37.579 --> 01:03:42.347
LAURA: I wanted to return it right away, and then
he wandered off. That's a lie, I didn't want to

01:03:42.347 --> 01:03:44.395
return it. But I did want to pay him!

01:03:44.395 --> 01:03:46.529
TRAVIS: I don't think you wanted to do that
either.

01:03:46.529 --> 01:03:50.783
LAURA: No, I did! I did, I wanted to pay him! But
he wandered away, and then I didn't pay him, and

01:03:50.783 --> 01:03:57.346
now I have this broom that I stole, and there's
really no way to return it. Well, I probably could

01:03:57.346 --> 01:03:59.947
find him, but I don't want to because now I can
fly, you guys.

01:03:59.947 --> 01:04:01.845
TRAVIS: Are you going to re-gift it?

01:04:01.845 --> 01:04:03.683
LAURA: No. I'm going to keep it.

01:04:03.683 --> 01:04:06.377
MARISHA: What do you say, Percy? I think it's kind
of funny.

01:04:06.377 --> 01:04:09.700
TALIESIN: Are you honestly asking my opinion? You
said what?

01:04:09.700 --> 01:04:13.648
LAURA: Actually, Percy, do you know-- I know you can
build things and make things wonderful.

01:04:13.648 --> 01:04:19.009
TALIESIN: Can you show me? What is this thing,
what did you steal? What is this thing?

01:04:19.009 --> 01:04:21.285
LAURA: I pull out the broom and I lift up in the
air.

01:04:21.285 --> 01:04:24.827
MATT: You guys watch as Vex all of a sudden
(whoosh) takes off above the breakfast room.

01:04:24.827 --> 01:04:25.832
TRAVIS: Sweet!

01:04:25.832 --> 01:04:28.641
MARISHA: All right, that is pretty cool, Vex.
That's pretty badass.

01:04:28.641 --> 01:04:30.336
TALIESIN: I don't know if I approve of the
metaphor, but that's--

01:04:30.336 --> 01:04:32.305
LIAM: What happens when you shoot a couple arrows
from up there?

01:04:32.305 --> 01:04:33.577
TRAVIS: Yeah, shoot me with an arrow!

01:04:33.577 --> 01:04:34.754
MARISHA: Yeah, shoot some arrows!

01:04:34.754 --> 01:04:36.712
TALIESIN: Okay, you're not holding onto the broom
anymore.

01:04:36.712 --> 01:04:38.823
LAURA: No, I've been practicing! I've been
practicing!

01:04:38.823 --> 01:04:44.829
MARISHA: I reach on the table and I grab what I'm
sure is a whole chicken sitting there.

01:04:44.829 --> 01:04:45.815
SAM: Sure.

01:04:45.815 --> 01:04:47.666
MARISHA: And I hold it up and I go--

01:04:47.666 --> 01:04:49.856
TALIESIN: Has it not occurred to you that you're
not going to be able to fly?

01:04:49.856 --> 01:04:53.947
LAURA: No, no, no, look! I'm not holding on,
Percy! Look at me, not holding on!

01:04:53.947 --> 01:04:56.118
MARISHA: Okay, Vex, ready? Ready, Vex? Vex?

01:04:56.118 --> 01:04:56.930
TALIESIN: Oh, dear.

01:04:56.930 --> 01:04:57.874
MARISHA: Trust.

01:04:57.874 --> 01:04:59.406
SAM: Watch your eyes. Watch your eyes.

01:04:59.406 --> 01:05:01.169
MARISHA: Trust Vex!

01:05:01.169 --> 01:05:04.197
MATT: All right, Laura, I want you to go ahead
and, first, roll a dexterity check.

01:05:04.197 --> 01:05:09.025
LAURA: Okay. Shut up! 13.

01:05:09.025 --> 01:05:16.076
MATT: 13, okay. You almost slip off the broom in
the process of drawing the arrow from the quiver.

01:05:16.076 --> 01:05:20.803
You catch yourself and just barely manage to pull
back and fire. I want you to go ahead and roll an

01:05:20.803 --> 01:05:22.588
attack with disadvantage.

01:05:22.588 --> 01:05:25.491
LAURA: Oh, man, disadvantage. Okay.

01:05:25.491 --> 01:05:30.877
MARISHA: Please, god, may your aim be true today,
Vex.

01:05:30.877 --> 01:05:33.165
LAURA: 16.

01:05:33.165 --> 01:05:38.665
MATT: 16. (impact) The arrow does get relatively
close to your hand, but it does

01:05:38.665 --> 01:05:40.365
stick into the turkey.

01:05:40.365 --> 01:05:43.416
MARISHA: She did it! I hand the chicken to
Scanlan.

01:05:43.416 --> 01:05:45.354
SAM: I start eating.

01:05:45.354 --> 01:05:47.307
TALIESIN: I pull the arrow out of the chicken.

01:05:47.307 --> 01:05:51.675
LIAM: Do it again! And I throw the chicken
closest to me into the air.

01:05:51.675 --> 01:05:52.867
LAURA: Oh, shit.

01:05:52.867 --> 01:05:53.840
SAM: A moving target!

01:05:53.840 --> 01:05:54.954
LAURA: Oh, god, okay.

01:05:54.954 --> 01:05:56.341
MATT: Okay, make another dexterity check.

01:05:56.341 --> 01:05:57.442
LAURA: Okay.

01:05:57.442 --> 01:05:58.622
SAM: There's lots of chickens, by the way.

01:05:58.622 --> 01:06:00.382
LAURA: Shit balls. 13.

01:06:00.382 --> 01:06:04.713
MATT: 13. Okay, this time, you start falling off
and you catch yourself entirely. The arrow just

01:06:04.713 --> 01:06:06.838
goes wide, you don't even get a chance to nock it
in the bow.

01:06:06.838 --> 01:06:08.739
LAURA: Mother bitch, I really need to work on
this! Okay.

01:06:08.739 --> 01:06:10.050
MARISHA: It'll take some practice.

01:06:10.050 --> 01:06:12.902
TALIESIN: I don't think this is-- this may be an
engineering issue.

01:06:12.902 --> 01:06:16.249
LAURA: Yes, Percy, this is the thing. Can you
build a seat on this?

01:06:16.249 --> 01:06:20.089
TALIESIN: I pull out my notepad and start
sketching.

01:06:20.089 --> 01:06:24.381
LAURA: What if you could build a seat, and then I
can sit on it instead of trying to sit on this

01:06:24.381 --> 01:06:25.509
tiny little stick?

01:06:25.509 --> 01:06:26.774
TALIESIN: Let me--

01:06:26.774 --> 01:06:28.063
SAM: Tinker?

01:06:28.063 --> 01:06:29.102
TALIESIN: Tinker.

01:06:29.102 --> 01:06:33.719
MARISHA: You know, beyond it being an engineering
issue, it might be a greed issue first.

01:06:33.719 --> 01:06:36.003
LAURA: Really?

01:06:36.003 --> 01:06:39.509
MARISHA: Look--

01:06:39.509 --> 01:06:41.445
LAURA: How's that mimosa treating you?

01:06:41.445 --> 01:06:49.693
MARISHA: It's phenomenal. It's been a long few
weeks. I don't care. I don't care. We're never

01:06:49.693 --> 01:06:53.338
going to see Gern again. I have so many other
things to care about.

01:06:53.338 --> 01:06:54.741
SAM: Oh, no, she's day drunk again.

01:06:54.741 --> 01:06:56.190
LAURA: Oh, no, are you already drunk, Keyleth?

01:06:56.190 --> 01:07:00.279
MARISHA: No! I'm just, it's been a long few--
Look.

01:07:00.279 --> 01:07:01.350
TRAVIS: Oh, Jesus!

01:07:01.350 --> 01:07:03.702
MARISHA: I don't care anymore.

01:07:03.702 --> 01:07:07.282
TRAVIS: How many was that? Just one, right? We've
been here for five minutes.

01:07:07.282 --> 01:07:08.651
LAURA: I float down.

01:07:08.651 --> 01:07:11.101
MARISHA: No! I just don't want you to die.

01:07:11.101 --> 01:07:14.247
LAURA: I float down eye-level, but I'm still
floating.

01:07:14.247 --> 01:07:18.871
MARISHA: I don't want you to die. I don't want you
to die because of your greed. I don't care that

01:07:18.871 --> 01:07:23.382
you have-- You look amazing. Doesn't she look
amazing?

01:07:23.382 --> 01:07:26.917
TALIESIN: Like a real hoverboard, is there a
chance this one might set on fire as well?

01:07:26.917 --> 01:07:28.747
LAURA: Why are you trying to be an asshole?

01:07:28.747 --> 01:07:29.905
TALIESIN: Sorry.

01:07:29.905 --> 01:07:37.513
LAURA: Here's the thing, Keyleth. I'm not afraid
to die anymore. I came to this realization. I've

01:07:37.513 --> 01:07:42.277
seen the other side. I've come to terms with it.

01:07:42.277 --> 01:07:46.103
MARISHA: Well, that's phenomenal that you've come
to terms with it! I don't know about the rest of

01:07:46.103 --> 01:07:48.434
us in the room that all watched you die, though.

01:07:48.434 --> 01:07:51.398
TALIESIN: I feel too guilty to say no to her. I'm
perfectly content to let this go.

01:07:51.398 --> 01:07:53.120
TRAVIS: It is pretty sweet, flying around like
that.

01:07:53.120 --> 01:07:54.161
LAURA: It's pretty wonderful.

01:07:54.161 --> 01:07:55.209
MARISHA: It's really cool.

01:07:55.209 --> 01:08:01.901
TALIESIN: She's an adult. Deep levels of arrested
development, but an adult nonetheless.

01:08:01.901 --> 01:08:04.049
MARISHA: I don't care about the broom.

01:08:04.049 --> 01:08:07.543
SAM: Keyleth, Vex swore to me that she would only
use it for good.

01:08:07.543 --> 01:08:10.964
LAURA: That's right. I'm not going to steal
anything while I'm riding on it.

01:08:10.964 --> 01:08:13.314
TALIESIN: Where would you put it, anyway? You
can't let go.

01:08:13.314 --> 01:08:16.709
MARISHA: Just don't get into trouble, I guess.

01:08:16.709 --> 01:08:20.088
LAURA: I'll practice as much as I can, and Percy's
going to help me.

01:08:20.088 --> 01:08:21.123
TALIESIN: Yes.

01:08:21.123 --> 01:08:22.954
LAURA: So I can be stable on this thing.

01:08:22.954 --> 01:08:25.443
TALIESIN: I may need some money, but we'll put
something together.

01:08:25.443 --> 01:08:26.937
LAURA: I will give you all the money you want.

01:08:26.937 --> 01:08:29.105
LIAM: Are you going to carry that on your back?

01:08:29.105 --> 01:08:30.427
LAURA: Maybe.

01:08:30.427 --> 01:08:32.828
LIAM: You'll look like a Byroden chimney sweep.

01:08:32.828 --> 01:08:35.727
LAURA: But I feel so good.

01:08:35.727 --> 01:08:42.959
MARISHA: You got out, you came out on top this
time. It might not happen next time.

01:08:42.959 --> 01:08:44.735
LAURA: I start eating while sitting on the broom.

01:08:44.735 --> 01:08:46.935
MARISHA: All right. I think she's listening to me.

01:08:46.935 --> 01:08:48.341
SAM: I think you broke through.

01:08:48.341 --> 01:08:49.376
MARISHA: I think I did.

01:08:49.376 --> 01:08:51.286
TALIESIN: I think you're learning to let people be
people.

01:08:51.286 --> 01:08:52.756
MARISHA: I don't care anymore.

01:08:52.756 --> 01:08:56.359
SAM: Oh, look, look! Another round of chickens has
just arrived for us to eat.

01:08:56.359 --> 01:08:57.964
MARISHA: Oh, chicken!

01:08:57.964 --> 01:09:01.982
SAM: I don't know what breakfast is, so I just
keep commanding them to make chickens.

01:09:01.982 --> 01:09:04.664
MATT: So much chicken, guys.

01:09:04.664 --> 01:09:06.609
LAURA: Where should we head to?

01:09:06.609 --> 01:09:13.057
SAM: What is our next-- Shoot, I kept a to-do list
for us, but I didn't bring it tonight.

01:09:13.057 --> 01:09:14.495
TRAVIS: (burps)

01:09:14.495 --> 01:09:17.218
SAM: Oh. I thought you were going to say
something. That was a belch?

01:09:17.218 --> 01:09:18.157
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:09:18.157 --> 01:09:21.199
LAURA: Did you want to head back to-- Actually,
Keyleth, you said something weird happened last

01:09:21.199 --> 01:09:23.065
night for you as well.

01:09:23.065 --> 01:09:33.430
MARISHA: Yeah. Cerkonos stopped by.

01:09:33.430 --> 01:09:39.742
LAURA: Yeah? I look at my brother. All right,
cool. Keep going.

01:09:39.742 --> 01:09:51.223
MARISHA: Not... As my elder. He stopped by as my
respected elder. Do you all remember

01:09:51.223 --> 01:09:52.958
the name Raishan?

01:09:52.958 --> 01:09:54.274
TALIESIN: Yes.

01:09:54.274 --> 01:09:55.918
LAURA: That's one of the dragons.

01:09:55.918 --> 01:09:59.660
MARISHA: Apparently she's our little
infiltrator.

01:09:59.660 --> 01:10:01.519
LAURA: What do you mean?

01:10:01.519 --> 01:10:11.270
MARISHA: She came to the Fire Ashari, she came to
Pyrah, about four years ago, and the Ashari, being

01:10:11.270 --> 01:10:14.497
the adoptive people that we are, they took her in.

01:10:14.497 --> 01:10:15.867
LAURA: They adopted a dragon?

01:10:15.867 --> 01:10:18.202
MARISHA: They adopted a dragon.

01:10:18.202 --> 01:10:20.136
LAURA: How?

01:10:20.136 --> 01:10:22.960
TALIESIN: Do they think she's the one who
sabotaged the rift?

01:10:22.960 --> 01:10:29.606
MARISHA: They do. They were unaware that she was a
dragon.

01:10:29.606 --> 01:10:32.666
SAM: Does that make her the leader or something?
Is that how all the dragons got through? I'm still

01:10:32.666 --> 01:10:34.042
not quite sure.

01:10:34.042 --> 01:10:35.908
TALIESIN: It makes her the instigator, at the very
least.

01:10:35.908 --> 01:10:42.551
MARISHA: It makes her fairly close to Thordak, it
would seem. Apparently, when she came to the Fire

01:10:42.551 --> 01:10:45.832
Ashari, she was about 15 years old, and...

01:10:45.832 --> 01:10:47.392
SAM: As a dragon?

01:10:47.392 --> 01:10:48.530
TALIESIN: Visually.

01:10:48.530 --> 01:10:50.330
MARISHA: As a human woman.

01:10:50.330 --> 01:10:53.181
LAURA: So she was making it seem like she was 15.

01:10:53.181 --> 01:10:58.547
MARISHA: She was making it seem like she was 15,
and they started realizing that she possessed

01:10:58.547 --> 01:11:08.492
powers far beyond anything that they had seen
before, and then these powers began to exceed

01:11:08.492 --> 01:11:15.217
anything beyond our druidic capabilities. And it
would seem that they realized that too late.

01:11:15.217 --> 01:11:20.574
SAM: Did they say anything about her goals, or
motivations? Her ambitions?

01:11:20.574 --> 01:11:29.379
MARISHA: Cerkonos said one day they woke up and
the mountain was spewing fire, and was angry with

01:11:29.379 --> 01:11:42.838
lava, and when he went to investigate it, she was
there, ripping open the rift. And that was when

01:11:42.838 --> 01:11:46.719
everything happened. When he came to
consciousness, everything was destroyed, so that's

01:11:46.719 --> 01:11:52.297
all he saw. And she was gone. But we know where
she went next.

01:11:52.297 --> 01:11:55.483
TRAVIS: Where?

01:11:55.483 --> 01:11:58.864
SAM: To Emon.

01:11:58.864 --> 01:12:00.312
LAURA: Oh, eventually.

01:12:00.312 --> 01:12:01.453
SAM: Kill everybody.

01:12:01.453 --> 01:12:03.951
LAURA: Right. Totally. That day. The day.

01:12:03.951 --> 01:12:08.550
MARISHA: I was trying to skip exposition, I
thought you guys could fill in the blanks.

01:12:08.550 --> 01:12:12.231
TALIESIN: We thought you had new information
beyond that and would maybe want to add. It was

01:12:12.231 --> 01:12:13.635
certainly set up that way.

01:12:13.635 --> 01:12:15.572
MARISHA: Thank you. I'll work on that next time.

01:12:15.572 --> 01:12:16.812
TALIESIN: It was very leading.

01:12:16.812 --> 01:12:19.035
LAURA: Okay, well that's good to know.

01:12:19.035 --> 01:12:26.401
SAM: So perhaps we should inquire if you think
this-- Raishan?

01:12:26.401 --> 01:12:28.005
MARISHA: Raishan.

01:12:28.005 --> 01:12:34.859
SAM: Has tried to pretend to be a human woman in
any other place? Should we ask around, or was it

01:12:34.859 --> 01:12:39.767
just the one ruse here to gain entry for her
companions?

01:12:39.767 --> 01:12:42.324
MARISHA: I'm not sure.

01:12:42.324 --> 01:12:45.924
SAM: All right. Well, don't trust anyone.

01:12:45.924 --> 01:12:48.489
MARISHA: Don't trust anyone.

01:12:48.489 --> 01:12:49.678
LAURA: Got it.

01:12:49.678 --> 01:12:52.531
MATT: Servant rushes forward, "More chicken,
sir?"

01:12:52.531 --> 01:12:54.361
SAM: Keep it coming.

01:12:54.361 --> 01:12:55.503
MATT: "Right away."

01:12:55.503 --> 01:12:57.414
LAURA: Do you guys have vegetables, maybe? Any
vegetables?

01:12:57.414 --> 01:12:58.712
MATT: "Vegetables, sir?"

01:12:58.712 --> 01:13:01.865
SAM: I forgot to tell them to make them. Sorry.
It's all chicken.

01:13:01.865 --> 01:13:02.996
MATT: "Chicken it is."

01:13:02.996 --> 01:13:08.429
LAURA: Cool. Chicken and mimosas, it's my favorite
breakfast.

01:13:08.429 --> 01:13:10.256
MARISHA: And waffles.

01:13:10.256 --> 01:13:15.432
SAM: Oh, waffles too? Chicken and waffles, that's
right. Maybe someone else should be in charge of

01:13:15.432 --> 01:13:20.206
the food next time we come here. My tastes are a
little--

01:13:20.206 --> 01:13:21.585
TALIESIN: Base?

01:13:21.585 --> 01:13:22.751
LAURA: Little?

01:13:22.751 --> 01:13:24.111
SAM: Singular.

01:13:24.111 --> 01:13:30.337
MARISHA: And one thing that this does confirm is
that this has been a plan that's been in the

01:13:30.337 --> 01:13:33.049
process for a very, very long time.

01:13:33.049 --> 01:13:35.715
SAM: No, I just came up with the chicken this
morning when I woke up.

01:13:35.715 --> 01:13:37.536
LAURA: Where are we going next, you guys?

01:13:37.536 --> 01:13:45.492
SAM: Grog had some brass knuckles to get. Was that
a thing? Did we get those?

01:13:45.492 --> 01:13:50.901
TRAVIS: No. We haven't gotten those yet. But
there's other things to explore.

01:13:50.901 --> 01:13:56.502
SAM: All right. Wait, did we have to go make a
trip to anyone else's homeland? How's Whitestone?

01:13:56.502 --> 01:14:01.366
LAURA: We need to talk to a sphinx. A sphinx's
boyfriend.

01:14:01.366 --> 01:14:05.107
SAM: Oh, that's right. Maybe that should be our
next--

01:14:05.107 --> 01:14:07.154
MARISHA: What was his name? Hang on.

01:14:07.154 --> 01:14:11.525
SAM: And what were we trying to get there? Another
one of the articles of confederation?

01:14:11.525 --> 01:14:16.648
MARISHA: We need the Titanstone Knuckles of Kord,
which Kevdak has.

01:14:16.648 --> 01:14:18.581
TRAVIS: Yep.

01:14:18.581 --> 01:14:21.065
LAURA: That's with your tribe.

01:14:21.065 --> 01:14:22.183
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:14:22.183 --> 01:14:24.125
SAM: Okay, but then there's the sphinx.

01:14:24.125 --> 01:14:25.871
LIAM: Time for a family reunion, Grog.

01:14:25.871 --> 01:14:27.145
SAM: What's that, Vax?

01:14:27.145 --> 01:14:31.531
LIAM: I said it's time for a family reunion, Grog.
Are you ready for that, or do you want to put that

01:14:31.531 --> 01:14:33.060
off a bit?

01:14:33.060 --> 01:14:39.281
TRAVIS: Oh, no, I mean. Whenever. It's. You know.

01:14:39.281 --> 01:14:43.175
LAURA: So do you want to go now, or do you want to
maybe swing by somewhere?

01:14:43.175 --> 01:14:44.959
TALIESIN: It's either that or the library, I
imagine.

01:14:44.959 --> 01:14:46.677
TRAVIS: You want to go to the library?

01:14:46.677 --> 01:14:49.724
TALIESIN: I was just saying that it's either that
or the library.

01:14:49.724 --> 01:14:52.911
SAM: So it's Grog's herd or the sphinx to get
something.

01:14:52.911 --> 01:14:54.909
LAURA: We'll remember.

01:14:54.909 --> 01:15:02.816
SAM: On the way. And then, or, TBD, find something
else to do. I guess Grog's thing is the most

01:15:02.816 --> 01:15:06.685
promising. We know that there's Knuckles there, we
know that there's people we'll know there.

01:15:06.685 --> 01:15:11.756
LAURA: Well, it's all actually around Westruun,
right? Aren't your people around Westruun?

01:15:11.756 --> 01:15:13.257
TRAVIS: You know, they roam.

01:15:13.257 --> 01:15:15.102
LAURA: So we have to find them.

01:15:15.102 --> 01:15:16.077
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:15:16.077 --> 01:15:19.437
LAURA: Last time we ran into them, wasn't it on
the way to Kraghammer?

01:15:19.437 --> 01:15:20.852
TALIESIN: From Westruun.

01:15:20.852 --> 01:15:23.943
MARISHA: Odessa's mate is south of the
Frostweald.

01:15:23.943 --> 01:15:25.251
LAURA: I think it was.

01:15:25.251 --> 01:15:26.342
TRAVIS: Was it?

01:15:26.342 --> 01:15:29.200
LIAM: Yeah, it was. On the way to Kraghammer,
that's right.

01:15:29.200 --> 01:15:31.501
SAM: Is Frostweald near Kraghammer as well?

01:15:31.501 --> 01:15:32.879
LAURA: The Frostweald is--

01:15:32.879 --> 01:15:34.207
MATT: South of Westruun.

01:15:34.207 --> 01:15:35.558
LAURA: South of Westruun, yes.

01:15:35.558 --> 01:15:38.640
TALIESIN: So let's make our way to Westruun, I
suppose, then.

01:15:38.640 --> 01:15:43.556
SAM: And that's in the direction of both Grog's
herd and the Frostweald?

01:15:43.556 --> 01:15:45.473
LAURA: Potentially? Well, Grog would know.

01:15:45.473 --> 01:15:47.308
TRAVIS: What?

01:15:47.308 --> 01:15:50.074
LAURA: Cool. Yes, I think Grog really wants to
go.

01:15:50.074 --> 01:15:51.680
SAM: Yeah, we should probably go there.

01:15:51.680 --> 01:15:52.627
LAURA: Yeah.

01:15:52.627 --> 01:15:53.619
SAM: Let's do that.

01:15:53.619 --> 01:15:59.116
MATT: Your herd wanders all across the Silvercut
Roadway, that whole area to the west of Westruun,

01:15:59.116 --> 01:16:01.883
south of Kraghammer, east of Emon, that vicinity.

01:16:01.883 --> 01:16:03.969
TRAVIS: They wander there.

01:16:03.969 --> 01:16:05.227
LAURA: Around there.

01:16:05.227 --> 01:16:06.168
TRAVIS: Yep.

01:16:06.168 --> 01:16:07.822
LAURA: Okay.

01:16:07.822 --> 01:16:16.964
TRAVIS: But look, I was thinking. It might be a
thing when we find them, right? So picture this.

01:16:16.964 --> 01:16:26.845
Me, and then a lot of other me's, and they're all
really big and angry. So if we want to do anything

01:16:26.845 --> 01:16:28.706
else before that happens--

01:16:28.706 --> 01:16:32.966
SAM: You think they'll attack us? But we're with
you! You're our ally!

01:16:32.966 --> 01:16:41.549
TRAVIS: Yeah, and I'm a super cool, awesome, fun
guy, but we didn't really leave in the best terms.

01:16:41.549 --> 01:16:42.934
LAURA: Oh, weren't you--

01:16:42.934 --> 01:16:47.874
TRAVIS: Ass-kicked, yeah. All left for dead,
pretty much.

01:16:47.874 --> 01:16:55.760
MARISHA: You know what, Grog, it's been a while.
Why exactly were you beat up and kicked out of

01:16:55.760 --> 01:16:57.180
your herd?

01:16:57.180 --> 01:17:03.875
TRAVIS: Right, so I was a bit younger, and we were
wandering through the woods, and we came upon this

01:17:03.875 --> 01:17:12.792
little old bearded thing, right? And he was
carrying groceries, like food and stuff, and

01:17:12.792 --> 01:17:18.044
everybody was a little hammered from boozing, and
they were like, hey, let's kill the little thing,

01:17:18.044 --> 01:17:21.889
and we'll string him up and see what his insides
look like! And normally I'm like, yay, I'll wear

01:17:21.889 --> 01:17:30.935
him as a hat! But he looked really sweet, and I
felt bad, so I said we shouldn't do that. And...

01:17:30.935 --> 01:17:39.961
They didn't like that answer. My uncle in
particular, he didn't like that, so he made me

01:17:39.961 --> 01:17:43.667
fight my cousin, his son.

01:17:43.667 --> 01:17:45.545
LAURA: And?

01:17:45.545 --> 01:17:49.315
TRAVIS: That wasn't bad, I handled that. It was
not a problem.

01:17:49.315 --> 01:17:53.368
MARISHA: Okay. So they might have a grudge about
that.

01:17:53.368 --> 01:17:58.105
TRAVIS: No, there's no grudge. They pretty much
think I'm dead, because after I whooped his son's

01:17:58.105 --> 01:17:59.717
ass, he whooped my ass.

01:17:59.717 --> 01:18:01.239
LAURA: Oh.

01:18:01.239 --> 01:18:02.243
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:18:02.243 --> 01:18:03.823
TALIESIN: We have a thing for that.

01:18:03.823 --> 01:18:04.821
SAM: We do?

01:18:04.821 --> 01:18:06.501
TALIESIN: Can I borrow your hat?

01:18:06.501 --> 01:18:08.729
SAM: Of course you can borrow my hat.

01:18:08.729 --> 01:18:11.048
LAURA: The Hat of Disguise?

01:18:11.048 --> 01:18:15.682
TALIESIN: If you don't want to have an immediate
confrontation with your family, there's no

01:18:15.682 --> 01:18:18.866
particular reason why they have to know you're
alive yet at all.

01:18:18.866 --> 01:18:24.319
SAM: You could wear this hat. Might not fit on
your head, you could maybe put it on one of your

01:18:24.319 --> 01:18:25.418
knuckles.

01:18:25.418 --> 01:18:27.408
TRAVIS: I'm not hiding from my herd.

01:18:27.408 --> 01:18:32.590
TALIESIN: You were giving off the impression of
one who is looking forward to putting something off.

01:18:32.590 --> 01:18:35.230
TRAVIS: I was, was I?

01:18:35.230 --> 01:18:40.554
TALIESIN: You were. You're not anymore, as if
you've been dared, somehow.

01:18:40.554 --> 01:18:42.977
LAURA: Very big.

01:18:42.977 --> 01:18:50.598
SAM: If you're too scared to do it, we can go
elsewhere. Sorry, I will never say that again.

01:18:50.598 --> 01:19:07.986
TRAVIS: No, I'm excited to go. I want to go. We
should go. You know, what we need is the wolf.

01:19:07.986 --> 01:19:09.457
LAURA: The wolf?

01:19:09.457 --> 01:19:10.862
TRAVIS: Yeah. We need--

01:19:10.862 --> 01:19:12.336
LAURA: Oh, the wolf in Whitestone?

01:19:12.336 --> 01:19:16.398
TRAVIS: Yeah. Don't they smell shit? He could help
us find them.

01:19:16.398 --> 01:19:17.750
LAURA: Well, Trinket can smell.

01:19:17.750 --> 01:19:22.124
MARISHA: And I can also theoretically turn into a
wolf to help us find things.

01:19:22.124 --> 01:19:28.014
TRAVIS: I mean, if you want to. I don't know how
long it's been since he's seen a she-wolf, so, you know.

01:19:28.014 --> 01:19:30.462
LIAM: Grog.

01:19:30.462 --> 01:19:32.796
MARISHA: I was talking as in--

01:19:32.796 --> 01:19:35.620
TRAVIS: I mean, it's very generous.

01:19:35.620 --> 01:19:40.205
LIAM: Just out of curiosity, we weren't going to
walk in and negotiate with your uncle. He's not

01:19:40.205 --> 01:19:45.266
going to give us these Knuckles. He's a proud
owner of them, yes?

01:19:45.266 --> 01:19:46.580
TRAVIS: Yep.

01:19:46.580 --> 01:19:50.594
LIAM: And how many are in the herd, roughly?

01:19:50.594 --> 01:19:55.004
TRAVIS: What's a number bigger than five?

01:19:55.004 --> 01:19:56.181
LAURA: Six?

01:19:56.181 --> 01:19:57.649
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's like six.

01:19:57.649 --> 01:20:05.173
MARISHA: You mean it's like at least six? Or
possibly more than six? How fast actually is the

01:20:05.173 --> 01:20:08.771
reproduction process of goliaths?

01:20:08.771 --> 01:20:12.174
TALIESIN: Are there more people in your herd or
fingers on your hand?

01:20:12.174 --> 01:20:18.887
LIAM: I hold up Scanlan's hands and then I hold up
my hands behind them so that all 20 fingers are

01:20:18.887 --> 01:20:23.972
waggling. Grog, are there more than this many in
your herd?

01:20:23.972 --> 01:20:25.493
TRAVIS: Yeah, six.

01:20:25.493 --> 01:20:26.643
LAURA: Okay.

01:20:26.643 --> 01:20:28.226
TALIESIN: He's counting hands, not fingers.

01:20:28.226 --> 01:20:31.087
LAURA: Oh. I hold up mine, too.

01:20:31.087 --> 01:20:33.239
SAM: We all hold up our hands.

01:20:33.239 --> 01:20:34.563
LAURA: How many hands is that?

01:20:34.563 --> 01:20:37.773
LIAM: We're doing rakshasa hands. Grog, is there
more of them than rakshasa hands?

01:20:37.773 --> 01:20:40.387
TRAVIS: That's closer, yeah. It's been a long
time.

01:20:40.387 --> 01:20:43.138
MARISHA: Yeah, this could be bad. This could be
bad.

01:20:43.138 --> 01:20:45.957
TALIESIN: We could attempt to steal them.

01:20:45.957 --> 01:20:49.976
LAURA: Steal from the goliaths? That could work.

01:20:49.976 --> 01:20:51.342
MARISHA: How easy is that?

01:20:51.342 --> 01:20:53.717
LAURA: Does he wear them all the time? Does he put
them in a chest?

01:20:53.717 --> 01:20:55.668
TRAVIS: I mean, they're pretty smart, they're like
me.

01:20:55.668 --> 01:20:58.267
LAURA: Yeah. You're right.

01:20:58.267 --> 01:21:03.283
LIAM: I don't think it's going to be pretty no
matter what we do, but I actually think trying to

01:21:03.283 --> 01:21:11.515
steal them might be a better angle than going
toe-to-toe with "six" goliaths. I just did air quotes.

01:21:11.515 --> 01:21:13.265
LAURA: If six is the right number.

01:21:13.265 --> 01:21:17.680
TRAVIS: Here's the thing, though. Normally, if you
try and steal something, or if you try and break

01:21:17.680 --> 01:21:24.479
the rules and you're like Keyleth and you get
arrested every time, arrested ain't so bad. They

01:21:24.479 --> 01:21:30.446
don't really arrest you. They, like, open you up
and use you as an appetizer.

01:21:30.446 --> 01:21:32.415
LAURA: As a hat.

01:21:32.415 --> 01:21:39.832
TRAVIS: Yeah. That was my thing, though. So I'm a
little nervous about that.

01:21:39.832 --> 01:21:42.818
LIAM: We just have to pick the least terrible
option right now.

01:21:42.818 --> 01:21:47.494
MARISHA: Well, we need these vestiges. We cannot
do anything without these vestiges.

01:21:47.494 --> 01:21:52.639
SAM: It seems to me that no matter where we go, we
are putting ourselves in peril.

01:21:52.639 --> 01:21:54.150
TRAVIS: Yep.

01:21:54.150 --> 01:21:57.653
SAM: So it's really just a question of which peril
do we want to face first.

01:21:57.653 --> 01:22:01.692
MARISHA: And don't we theoretically need the
vestiges before we go visit Odessa's boyfriend?

01:22:01.692 --> 01:22:04.941
SAM: I thought Odessa's boyfriend had a vestige.

01:22:04.941 --> 01:22:06.979
LAURA: No, he has locations of other vestiges.

01:22:06.979 --> 01:22:08.729
TRAVIS: Odessa? Osysa.

01:22:08.729 --> 01:22:09.829
MATT: Osysa.

01:22:09.829 --> 01:22:10.950
MARISHA: Sorry.

01:22:10.950 --> 01:22:14.325
TRAVIS: Shit, that's what I would call her.
Odessa.

01:22:14.325 --> 01:22:24.760
LAURA: I feel like Pike would want to come with
us, Grog. You're very dear to her.

01:22:24.760 --> 01:22:31.266
MARISHA: But wasn't Pike and her grandfather the
reason?

01:22:31.266 --> 01:22:35.651
TRAVIS: It was Pike's grandfather, yeah. And plus,
she's a healer.

01:22:35.651 --> 01:22:40.340
TALIESIN: At the very least, let's make our way to
Westruun, then. Let's get that far and see what's--

01:22:40.340 --> 01:22:43.975
MARISHA: Well, remember Westruun is under dragons
right now.

01:22:43.975 --> 01:22:45.809
SAM: We can instantly transport anywhere.

01:22:45.809 --> 01:22:48.246
LAURA: You know of trees outside of Westruun?

01:22:48.246 --> 01:22:53.668
MARISHA: I can, but it's under dragon reign. In
fact, isn't that where Raishan stopped off?

01:22:53.668 --> 01:22:59.363
MATT: No, the scrying that you saw was Umbrasyl,
the black dragon, that took up residence, it

01:22:59.363 --> 01:23:06.420
seems, in Gatshadow, the mountain north of
Westruun, at the base of the Cloudkeep mountain range.

01:23:06.420 --> 01:23:08.285
LAURA: And Gatshadow is where Grog got his scar,
right?

01:23:08.285 --> 01:23:10.703
MATT: Yep, that's where you guys initially... that
happened.

01:23:10.703 --> 01:23:20.512
TRAVIS: All right. Fuck. Look, if there's a lot of
them, and only a handful of us, it's not usually

01:23:20.512 --> 01:23:28.446
customary to have two sides go at each other. If
we want those Knuckles, I'm pretty sure it might

01:23:28.446 --> 01:23:38.373
have to be one on one. Now, I know I can totally
take my uncle. But I wouldn't mind if we found a

01:23:38.373 --> 01:23:46.517
few extra-credit items before we did that just in
case I have the flu that morning, or it burns when

01:23:46.517 --> 01:23:49.480
I pee. Just something to take the edge off.

01:23:49.480 --> 01:23:51.048
SAM: So sphinx first.

01:23:51.048 --> 01:23:53.977
TRAVIS: If that's what you want to do, then yeah!

01:23:53.977 --> 01:23:55.928
SAM: Say no more.

01:23:55.928 --> 01:24:01.291
MARISHA: Okay. And did we also want to check out
the Cobalt Reserve which was in Westruun, or did

01:24:01.291 --> 01:24:03.345
Allura already handle that and we're cool?

01:24:03.345 --> 01:24:05.015
LAURA: Allura, I think, handled that, right? You
saw her.

01:24:05.015 --> 01:24:10.333
MARISHA: She was there and it looked pretty
trashed. It looked like she grabbed a lot of the

01:24:10.333 --> 01:24:12.017
last of the good things.

01:24:12.017 --> 01:24:15.906
SAM: All right. Let's go to the sphinx, then.
Where's that? The Frostweald, we've been there.

01:24:15.906 --> 01:24:17.837
LAURA: Yes, we have been to the Frostweald.

01:24:17.837 --> 01:24:19.349
SAM: Do you remember any trees there?

01:24:19.349 --> 01:24:22.946
LAURA: Frostweald is where Grog mugged down with
the nymph, right?

01:24:22.946 --> 01:24:25.057
LIAM: Allegedly.

01:24:25.057 --> 01:24:26.147
LAURA: Allegedly.

01:24:26.147 --> 01:24:27.398
SAM: We'll never know.

01:24:27.398 --> 01:24:29.101
TRAVIS: Grog does not kiss and tell.

01:24:29.101 --> 01:24:30.048
LAURA: Yes, you do.

01:24:30.048 --> 01:24:31.113
TRAVIS: All the time.

01:24:31.113 --> 01:24:33.051
LIAM: All the time. All the time.

01:24:33.051 --> 01:24:36.516
MARISHA: Just not that one time that we want to
actually know.

01:24:36.516 --> 01:24:37.764
SAM: Let's go to the Frostweald.

01:24:37.764 --> 01:24:38.824
LAURA: Let's do it!

01:24:38.824 --> 01:24:40.161
SAM: Do you remember any trees?

01:24:40.161 --> 01:24:41.661
MARISHA: Do I remember any trees?

01:24:41.661 --> 01:24:46.640
MATT: At the time, because you were not
specifically paying attention to this ability of

01:24:46.640 --> 01:24:55.208
yours, there is no specific tree that has caught
your attention. You could attempt to make an

01:24:55.208 --> 01:24:59.308
intelligence roll.

01:24:59.308 --> 01:25:08.072
MARISHA: Not my strong suit. A straight
intelligence check? Nine.

01:25:08.072 --> 01:25:14.203
MATT: Nine. Unfortunately, you can't recall the
specific location of any trees in the Frostweald.

01:25:14.203 --> 01:25:17.726
It's been a long time since then, and you weren't
being conscious of it at the time.

01:25:17.726 --> 01:25:21.304
MARISHA: It's been a few years, you guys.

01:25:21.304 --> 01:25:24.679
TALIESIN: All trees look the same, don't they?

01:25:24.679 --> 01:25:26.126
MARISHA: After a while.

01:25:26.126 --> 01:25:28.380
TALIESIN: Say it. All trees look the same.

01:25:28.380 --> 01:25:30.385
LIAM: All right. Everybody hop on Vex's broom.

01:25:30.385 --> 01:25:33.856
LAURA: I mean, we could try.

01:25:33.856 --> 01:25:39.164
MARISHA: I could get us close, or I could scry and
look for a tree.

01:25:39.164 --> 01:25:40.857
MATT: If you would like to, yeah.

01:25:40.857 --> 01:25:42.931
MARISHA: Can I take time to do that?

01:25:42.931 --> 01:25:48.167
MATT: If you want to, yeah. The trees in the area
that you would know, that you recall, there was

01:25:48.167 --> 01:25:54.937
a... There were trees based around the Crossroads,
which is the middle point of the Silvercut roadway

01:25:54.937 --> 01:26:00.188
that's even further northwest, and west of
Westruun. There's the Bramblewood Forest, which is

01:26:00.188 --> 01:26:10.289
just north of Westruun. Most of them would be
further west from there. Those are the closest.

01:26:10.289 --> 01:26:15.004
MARISHA: The closest destination. Would the
Crossroads be good? Maybe get us to the

01:26:15.004 --> 01:26:16.254
Crossroads?

01:26:16.254 --> 01:26:19.576
SAM: Or we could just go to Westruun. Is Westruun
still there?

01:26:19.576 --> 01:26:22.643
LAURA: Westruun's under dragon rule. There's an
actual dragon on Westruun.

01:26:22.643 --> 01:26:26.286
MATT: Not on. Up in the mountain, but watching
down, probably.

01:26:26.286 --> 01:26:29.973
MARISHA: But they've got wyverns policing, right,
in Westruun?

01:26:29.973 --> 01:26:32.180
MATT: You didn't notice in your scry.

01:26:32.180 --> 01:26:37.088
MARISHA: I'm going to assume. Let's do the
Crossroads.

01:26:37.088 --> 01:26:38.575
LAURA: Let's do it! Let's do it! Let's do it!

01:26:38.575 --> 01:26:41.713
MARISHA: We could theoretically run into your
herd, though.

01:26:41.713 --> 01:26:43.044
TRAVIS: Yeah, I mean, I hope we do.

01:26:43.044 --> 01:26:44.600
LAURA: Yeah.

01:26:44.600 --> 01:26:47.683
MARISHA: To the Crossroads!

01:26:47.683 --> 01:26:57.649
MATT: Okay. So you're going to the Crossroads. The
Crossroads is about two days of travel northeast

01:26:57.649 --> 01:27:00.727
of the Frostweald, about three days' travel.

01:27:00.727 --> 01:27:04.549
MARISHA: So I would be going northeast from the
Crossroads? Or if I wanted to go in the

01:27:04.549 --> 01:27:08.840
Bramblewood I would have to southwest to get to
the Frostweald?

01:27:08.840 --> 01:27:16.281
MATT: Here we go. This is the Frostweald. This is
Westruun. This is the Crossroads. This is Emon.

01:27:16.281 --> 01:27:18.012
This is Kraghammer.

01:27:18.012 --> 01:27:19.600
LAURA: Oh shit.

01:27:19.600 --> 01:27:21.561
MARISHA: Where's the Bramble forest?

01:27:21.561 --> 01:27:26.168
MATT: It's right here. It's by Westruun. The
Crossroads is over here. You can totally take the

01:27:26.168 --> 01:27:27.454
Crossroads, but it'll be--

01:27:27.454 --> 01:27:28.760
LAURA: Go to the forest.

01:27:28.760 --> 01:27:30.407
MARISHA: Let's go to the forest. Let's go to the
Bramblewood forest.

01:27:30.407 --> 01:27:31.974
MATT: Bramblewood forest? Okay, that's fine.

01:27:31.974 --> 01:27:37.130
MARISHA: There's got to be some big trees there. I
remember a few big trees. I remember admiring a

01:27:37.130 --> 01:27:39.004
few big trees in the Bramblewood forest.

01:27:39.004 --> 01:27:43.013
MATT: Because you spent a lot of time in Westruun,
specifically, you do recall various locations. You

01:27:43.013 --> 01:27:46.922
take a moment to concentrate on a few trees
actually within Westruun. You recall there was one

01:27:46.922 --> 01:27:50.728
that was near a playground where you had once
interrogated a small child if they had seen--

01:27:50.728 --> 01:27:54.329
TALIESIN: Yeah! I remember that!

01:27:54.329 --> 01:27:56.060
SAM: We spent a whole day in that park.

01:27:56.060 --> 01:28:02.895
MATT: Yep. You begin to cast the spell and you
concentrate on that tree in the park. There's no

01:28:02.895 --> 01:28:06.853
connection to the tree. You gather that the tree
may not have survived the initial attack on

01:28:06.853 --> 01:28:13.409
Westruun. However, you do take a moment and you do
recall at the entrance to the Bramblewood, when

01:28:13.409 --> 01:28:17.528
you guys were briefly attacked by that group of
thieves that were pulling you off to the side,

01:28:17.528 --> 01:28:20.335
pretending to be a stranded caravan.

01:28:20.335 --> 01:28:22.741
MARISHA: That was good.

01:28:22.741 --> 01:28:29.443
MATT: There was a series of rather large trees
that marked the roadway there, and you recall one

01:28:29.443 --> 01:28:36.116
that had distinct markings, and you do manage to
find a point of concentration or connection there.

01:28:36.116 --> 01:28:39.901
MARISHA: I guess it took me a moment to find
signal. Okay. All right. We're good.

01:28:39.901 --> 01:28:41.250
SAM: You need a signal boost.

01:28:41.250 --> 01:28:42.500
MARISHA: I think I got one.

01:28:42.500 --> 01:28:45.930
MATT: You complete the spell against one of the
petrified trees on the outside of the Cindergrove.

01:28:45.930 --> 01:28:51.523
The doorway opens up, and you guys can see a
thicket of Bramblewood trees on the opposite side.

01:28:51.523 --> 01:28:57.043
You all rush through one after the other, Trinket
jumping behind. You all make it through, and

01:28:57.043 --> 01:29:05.314
you're now standing on the central pathway of the
Bramblewood. Further south, you're probably about

01:29:05.314 --> 01:29:09.656
an hour and a half foot travel before you exit the
southern portion of the forest.

01:29:09.656 --> 01:29:13.150
MARISHA: All right, sorry, guys, this is as close
as I could get us.

01:29:13.150 --> 01:29:14.329
LAURA: No, this is great!

01:29:14.329 --> 01:29:16.594
SAM: And how far are we now? A day's travel? Two
days' travel, you said?

01:29:16.594 --> 01:29:29.539
MATT: To the Frostweald? You're about a day and a
half. On horseback you're about a day, under a

01:29:29.539 --> 01:29:32.799
day. On foot, you're looking at about two days'
travel, a little over two days' travel.

01:29:32.799 --> 01:29:34.343
SAM and LAURA: Ugh.

01:29:34.343 --> 01:29:36.014
MATT: That's a rapid pace.

01:29:36.014 --> 01:29:37.451
MARISHA: Mist form.

01:29:37.451 --> 01:29:39.465
TRAVIS: Or we go where?

01:29:39.465 --> 01:29:41.105
MARISHA: We could be clouds.

01:29:41.105 --> 01:29:42.668
SAM: We're not very fast in mist form, are we?

01:29:42.668 --> 01:29:43.699
LAURA: No, we are, we're super fast.

01:29:43.699 --> 01:29:44.622
SAM: Are we?

01:29:44.622 --> 01:29:45.612
MATT: You're fast in mist form.

01:29:45.612 --> 01:29:47.814
MARISHA: How long would it take to get us in mist
form?

01:29:47.814 --> 01:29:53.521
MATT: It would be a little bit faster than a
horse.

01:29:53.521 --> 01:29:55.610
SAM: Like a day.

01:29:55.610 --> 01:29:58.914
MARISHA: Should we turn into clouds and go?

01:29:58.914 --> 01:30:01.110
SAM: I haven't done this before. Is it freaky?

01:30:01.110 --> 01:30:02.769
LAURA: I pop Trinket back into his little
crystal.

01:30:02.769 --> 01:30:04.972
SAM: Is it super freaky?

01:30:04.972 --> 01:30:07.370
TALIESIN: It's so super freaky.

01:30:07.370 --> 01:30:11.120
SAM: All right.

01:30:11.120 --> 01:30:16.365
LAURA: Percy, what if instead of a seat, what if
it was like I was straddling it, and there were

01:30:16.365 --> 01:30:18.610
two little things like footholds?

01:30:18.610 --> 01:30:20.456
TALIESIN: I'm sorry, do you want to design this?

01:30:20.456 --> 01:30:21.818
LAURA: No, no, it's up to you. It's totally you.

01:30:21.818 --> 01:30:22.894
TALIESIN: Are you sure?

01:30:22.894 --> 01:30:24.518
LAURA: I was just coming up with ideas to help you
out.

01:30:24.518 --> 01:30:27.505
TALIESIN: You're welcome to design this, it's just
going to be much more expensive.

01:30:27.505 --> 01:30:29.597
LAURA: No, no, it's all you. It's all you.

01:30:29.597 --> 01:30:32.216
MATT: So, Keyleth, what are you doing? Are you
doing the--

01:30:32.216 --> 01:30:36.929
MARISHA: Yeah. I'm picking my spells because I
haven't done that yet, but yeah. We'll poof!

01:30:36.929 --> 01:30:41.749
MATT: So Keyleth goes ahead and casts-- Is it Wind
Walk?

01:30:41.749 --> 01:30:42.994
MARISHA: Wind Walk.

01:30:42.994 --> 01:30:49.486
MATT: All of you guys take a moment to transform
into a mist form, and you all begin to coast right

01:30:49.486 --> 01:30:56.897
around the top of the trees, making your way south
to the back of the Bramblewood. As soon as you

01:30:56.897 --> 01:31:03.486
exit the top of the trees, you can see Westruun
ahead of you, and there are a number of

01:31:03.486 --> 01:31:09.148
interesting things that catch your attention. First
and foremost, you see, halfway between the

01:31:09.148 --> 01:31:14.911
treetops to the south end of the forest and the
very north part of Westruun, there appears to be a

01:31:14.911 --> 01:31:21.975
large, green open field with thicker patches of
grassland here and there. There is a section that

01:31:21.975 --> 01:31:30.476
is a grassless dirt mound, that has, as you start
coasting over you can see, what looks like spikes

01:31:30.476 --> 01:31:37.980
of wood, a couple of things that glimmer in the
light as you pass over, and what looks like large

01:31:37.980 --> 01:31:46.018
grooves dug in a haphazard pattern. This patch is
about 15 or 20 feet across, and you see two people

01:31:46.018 --> 01:31:48.317
bringing a cart away from it.

01:31:48.317 --> 01:31:52.588
LAURA: Can we mist down a little closer to get a
better view of what it is?

01:31:52.588 --> 01:31:55.610
MATT: Yeah. These wispy people-clouds (wind).

01:31:55.610 --> 01:31:58.738
TALIESIN: Those clouds look like half-elves!

01:31:58.738 --> 01:32:09.878
MATT: No one seems to pay mind. The two
individuals that went away with the cart are a

01:32:09.878 --> 01:32:14.638
little far from what you can see at this point,
but they both appear to be humanoid, in no

01:32:14.638 --> 01:32:20.564
particular rush but they're hauling this large
cart away. As you look, you can see in this patch

01:32:20.564 --> 01:32:26.972
of dirt, the glimmers that you saw was a
smattering of gold and silver coins that appear to

01:32:26.972 --> 01:32:32.240
have been tossed into this pile. It looks like
there are pieces of wood that have been broken and

01:32:32.240 --> 01:32:40.326
crushed in the giant grooves. Who's taking the
intense look at this one right now? Okay, so the

01:32:40.326 --> 01:32:42.923
two of you, I want you to roll investigation
checks.

01:32:42.923 --> 01:32:47.192
TALIESIN: 18.

01:32:47.192 --> 01:32:51.194
LAURA: Wow. No, 16 for me.

01:32:51.194 --> 01:32:57.186
MATT: You recognize, and you get a feel for it
too, because of your specialty in this, you notice

01:32:57.186 --> 01:33:05.318
that the giant grooves that tear into this are
actually sweeping claw marks, like something of a

01:33:05.318 --> 01:33:11.737
large size and a very fast speed came down, and
has come down multiple times, to snatch up

01:33:11.737 --> 01:33:14.116
something that was placed in this location.

01:33:14.116 --> 01:33:16.709
LAURA: Oh, this is where they make their
offerings.

01:33:16.709 --> 01:33:18.265
TALIESIN: This is where the offerings are made.

01:33:18.265 --> 01:33:24.555
LAURA: That's good to know. I have advantage on
anything having to do with dragons.

01:33:24.555 --> 01:33:29.039
MATT: Right, which, as you're seeing this now,
yeah, you would gather the information with him as

01:33:29.039 --> 01:33:33.263
you did. Do you guys continue southward?

01:33:33.263 --> 01:33:35.055
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:33:35.055 --> 01:33:36.466
MATT: Coasting on the outskirts of the city?

01:33:36.466 --> 01:33:38.063
LAURA: It's good to know that that's there,
though.

01:33:38.063 --> 01:33:39.640
TRAVIS: We could set an ambush later.

01:33:39.640 --> 01:33:40.757
LAURA: Yeah!

01:33:40.757 --> 01:33:45.686
MATT: You guys begin to coast around the outside
of Westruun, drifting up above as well, this wispy

01:33:45.686 --> 01:33:54.370
pattern of clouds. You get a view of the external
farmlands that dot the north-northwestern side of

01:33:54.370 --> 01:34:02.219
Westruun. A number of them appear to have been
burned. Not like forest fire or cataclysmic

01:34:02.219 --> 01:34:08.732
meteorite, like intentionally burned. The crops
are charred and black, and there's a pattern to

01:34:08.732 --> 01:34:15.704
how that was set. A few farmhouses also appear to
have burned as well. But there are farmlands that

01:34:15.704 --> 01:34:21.702
are also functional, and you can see people
tilling the land. I want everyone to make a

01:34:21.702 --> 01:34:23.322
perception check.

01:34:23.322 --> 01:34:24.212
TRAVIS: A what?

01:34:24.212 --> 01:34:25.652
LAURA: Perception.

01:34:25.652 --> 01:34:30.563
TRAVIS: 14.

01:34:30.563 --> 01:34:33.445
MARISHA: 16.

01:34:33.445 --> 01:34:34.494
TALIESIN: 18.

01:34:34.494 --> 01:34:35.554
SAM: Three!

01:34:35.554 --> 01:34:36.480
LAURA: 31.

01:34:36.480 --> 01:34:38.031
LIAM: 22.

01:34:38.031 --> 01:34:48.892
MATT: Okay, so people above 20 would be the twins.
All right, so Vex and Vax, you guys look over

01:34:48.892 --> 01:34:57.013
these fields and two things you notice. One, each
set of farmers that are working, there is a

01:34:57.013 --> 01:35:03.653
well-armed individual on the outskirts of each of
these farms that is intently watching them work.

01:35:03.653 --> 01:35:09.381
As you're paying attention to this, one of them
walks over and starts screaming at one and pushes

01:35:09.381 --> 01:35:18.482
them over, and then stands back and keeps guard.
You also notice that the outside of the city,

01:35:18.482 --> 01:35:24.971
there appears to be some sort of construct or
battlements, almost like another wall, a very thin

01:35:24.971 --> 01:35:27.907
wall, has been built around the various entrances
to the city.

01:35:27.907 --> 01:35:32.093
LAURA: They've imprisoned the people. We can't
talk to each other.

01:35:32.093 --> 01:35:34.830
MATT: Can't talk to each other, no, not in mist
form.

01:35:34.830 --> 01:35:37.021
TALIESIN: Just vape at each other.

01:35:37.021 --> 01:35:45.910
TRAVIS: Do we keep going, or do we-- Somebody make
a choice. Down or keep going?

01:35:45.910 --> 01:35:49.781
LAURA: I don't know what good we'll do right now.

01:35:49.781 --> 01:35:52.626
MARISHA: Can't do anything right now.

01:35:52.626 --> 01:35:54.493
TALIESIN: You're the only two that have noticed.

01:35:54.493 --> 01:35:56.439
MATT: It's up to you guys. Do you guys want to go
investigate, or do you want to keep going south?

01:35:56.439 --> 01:35:58.838
LAURA: I mean, how many guards are there around
there?

01:35:58.838 --> 01:36:03.901
MATT: You only see two that are actually in the
immediate farmland, and they're quite a walk away

01:36:03.901 --> 01:36:07.777
from the actual city. They don't appear to be on
heavy lockdown.

01:36:07.777 --> 01:36:14.796
LIAM: As wind, I'll pull in front of my sister and
use windiness and wind hands and wind farts to put

01:36:14.796 --> 01:36:22.591
up a stop sign with my hands and point down if
that's possible in this form.

01:36:22.591 --> 01:36:27.744
MATT: Yeah, that's possible in the form. Vex, you
see Vax, your brother, stop in front of you, put

01:36:27.744 --> 01:36:29.822
his hands up, and point downward with his hands.

01:36:29.822 --> 01:36:37.161
LAURA: What do you want to do? What do you want? I
noticed it too.

01:36:37.161 --> 01:36:38.985
TALIESIN: I float on over to this.

01:36:38.985 --> 01:36:45.277
LIAM: I'm going to go down and I'm going to motion
for her to follow.

01:36:45.277 --> 01:36:46.837
TALIESIN: All right, going down.

01:36:46.837 --> 01:36:47.878
MATT: You guys all follow?

01:36:47.878 --> 01:36:49.088
TALIESIN: I'll solidify on the ground.

01:36:49.088 --> 01:36:52.756
SAM: I'm still thinking about, what were those big
gashes in the ground back there?

01:36:52.756 --> 01:36:56.680
MATT: Yeah, it was really confusing to you. All
right, you guys all drift down towards the ground

01:36:56.680 --> 01:37:00.890
as you see Vax begin to take on physical form on
the outskirts.

01:37:00.890 --> 01:37:03.863
LAURA: Oh, shit. Can we stealth? As we come out of
it, I want to cast Pass Without a Trace

01:37:03.863 --> 01:37:04.974
immediately.

01:37:04.974 --> 01:37:09.214
MATT: Okay. Are you going down to the burnt
farmland or one of the healthy farms?

01:37:09.214 --> 01:37:13.010
LAURA: Can we go down in an area that there's
shadow, to where we're hidden?

01:37:13.010 --> 01:37:16.192
MATT: There are a few of the fields that are more
high crop, corn-style stalks.

01:37:16.192 --> 01:37:18.169
LAURA: Somewhere that when we take form, we'll be
hidden.

01:37:18.169 --> 01:37:19.362
TRAVIS: Just you two, right?

01:37:19.362 --> 01:37:20.172
LAURA: I don't know.

01:37:20.172 --> 01:37:21.015
TALIESIN: I'm going down, too.

01:37:21.015 --> 01:37:21.884
TRAVIS: You three?

01:37:21.884 --> 01:37:25.562
MATT: Okay. Percy, Vax, and Vex all take a moment
to revert back to their physical form.

01:37:25.562 --> 01:37:28.713
SAM: Oh, I'm reverting, too. I'm a follower.

01:37:28.713 --> 01:37:30.573
MATT: All right, Scanlan. Keyleth?

01:37:30.573 --> 01:37:32.880
MARISHA: I guess so.

01:37:32.880 --> 01:37:37.495
TRAVIS: Wow, we're just going to make this super
obvious, huh? There are dragons flying overhead.

01:37:37.495 --> 01:37:40.510
TALIESIN: Well, we've landed.

01:37:40.510 --> 01:37:41.831
MARISHA: We're in a corn field.

01:37:41.831 --> 01:37:44.693
TRAVIS: Yeah, we've landed. Let's do it. We all
want to die.

01:37:44.693 --> 01:37:49.508
MATT: All right, so all of you, including Grog, or
are you staying in your mist form?

01:37:49.508 --> 01:37:52.369
TRAVIS: Fuck it. Let's do it. I'm changing.

01:37:52.369 --> 01:37:55.677
MATT: You all take a moment to revert to your
physical form. I would like everyone to make a

01:37:55.677 --> 01:37:56.877
stealth check.

01:37:56.877 --> 01:37:58.880
LAURA: And I cast Pass Without a Trace, so it's
extra ten.

01:37:58.880 --> 01:38:02.596
MARISHA: Ooh! Natural 19.

01:38:02.596 --> 01:38:05.518
TRAVIS: Hey, 18!

01:38:05.518 --> 01:38:09.629
LAURA: 32.

01:38:09.629 --> 01:38:10.945
LIAM: 25.

01:38:10.945 --> 01:38:12.912
LAURA: Add ten!

01:38:12.912 --> 01:38:14.538
LIAM: 35!

01:38:14.538 --> 01:38:16.141
TALIESIN: 31.

01:38:16.141 --> 01:38:17.039
SAM: 29.

01:38:17.039 --> 01:38:18.048
MARISHA: 36.

01:38:18.048 --> 01:38:19.059
SAM: We're all good.

01:38:19.059 --> 01:38:19.985
TRAVIS: 28.

01:38:19.985 --> 01:38:21.274
MATT: What did you get again?

01:38:21.274 --> 01:38:22.198
LAURA: 32.

01:38:22.198 --> 01:38:23.623
TALIESIN: You don't know we're here anymore.

01:38:23.623 --> 01:38:32.677
MATT: Where'd the party go? You all begin to weave
your way through the various lines of high-stalk

01:38:32.677 --> 01:38:37.849
crop. Where are you heading? Are you heading in
towards the city, or are you heading

01:38:37.849 --> 01:38:38.915
towards the farmers?

01:38:38.915 --> 01:38:43.650
LAURA: We just want to sit here for a minute and
talk about it. Can we just say, so here's the

01:38:43.650 --> 01:38:49.030
thing. Those guards are attacking the farmers. I'm
pretty sure they're using slave labor at this

01:38:49.030 --> 01:38:57.082
point. Kind of like you, Scanlan! Slave labor to
provide food for the city. Vax really wanted to

01:38:57.082 --> 01:39:01.974
stop down, but the thing is, if we kill the guards
and set the farmers free, everybody in the city

01:39:01.974 --> 01:39:04.628
might starve. It's a tough situation right now.

01:39:04.628 --> 01:39:07.748
TALIESIN: Or they might just send more guards,
once they know that one's been killed, and then

01:39:07.748 --> 01:39:09.270
kill everybody involved.

01:39:09.270 --> 01:39:14.440
LAURA: I'm afraid right now I don't know what all
we can do in this town until we can defeat the

01:39:14.440 --> 01:39:17.662
dragon, which unfortunately is rather close.

01:39:17.662 --> 01:39:19.298
MARISHA: It's a bigger problem.

01:39:19.298 --> 01:39:22.742
TALIESIN: We can't do anything for them right now
until we actually know what's happening.

01:39:22.742 --> 01:39:26.392
MATT: As you guys are having this conversation,
you can see there's a slight rustle, and a

01:39:26.392 --> 01:39:32.037
farmer comes across, carrying a small satchel as
he's picking things off of one of the nearby areas.

01:39:32.037 --> 01:39:33.636
TRAVIS: Is he close to us?

01:39:33.636 --> 01:39:35.219
MATT: About 15 feet from you.

01:39:35.219 --> 01:39:36.242
MARISHA: Does he see us?

01:39:36.242 --> 01:39:37.567
MATT: He doesn't seem to notice you guys.

01:39:37.567 --> 01:39:40.977
LAURA: I mean, we can tell him to hold out hope.

01:39:40.977 --> 01:39:43.913
TALIESIN: Maybe he knows what's going on.

01:39:43.913 --> 01:39:48.365
LAURA: He could also be one of the assholes that's
serving the dragon, just like people in Emon.

01:39:48.365 --> 01:39:55.445
TRAVIS: I go (clicks).

01:39:55.445 --> 01:40:02.210
MATT: The farmer turns. (gasps) You now see him.
It's a man in his late 40s, early 50s, gray beard.

01:40:02.210 --> 01:40:05.514
TRAVIS: Shh! Help me out. Shh.

01:40:05.514 --> 01:40:06.490
MATT: "Yeah..."

01:40:06.490 --> 01:40:07.419
TRAVIS: Shh!

01:40:07.419 --> 01:40:08.470
LAURA: Act natural!

01:40:08.470 --> 01:40:09.401
TRAVIS: Keep picking!

01:40:09.401 --> 01:40:10.601
LAURA: Keep picking!

01:40:10.601 --> 01:40:12.005
MATT: He keeps picking.

01:40:12.005 --> 01:40:16.992
LAURA: Hey, you. Do you like the dragon or do you
not like the dragon?

01:40:16.992 --> 01:40:21.378
TALIESIN: In the interest of the internet, we
should probably do stage whispers.

01:40:21.378 --> 01:40:23.769
LAURA: Do you like the dragon or do you not like
the dragon?

01:40:23.769 --> 01:40:30.084
MATT: You can see there's some heavy bruising on
his face and part of his cheek is swollen. He

01:40:30.084 --> 01:40:36.114
goes, "It would be hard around these parts to find
someone who likes a dragon, let alone that one."

01:40:36.114 --> 01:40:37.333
LAURA: Good.

01:40:37.333 --> 01:40:40.017
MATT: "Not the worst of the worries right now,
though."

01:40:40.017 --> 01:40:41.280
LAURA: What's the worst?

01:40:41.280 --> 01:40:43.503
MATT: "The ones who work for him."

01:40:43.503 --> 01:40:49.768
LAURA: Right. So you have to provide food for
everybody living in the city? Is that how that goes?

01:40:49.768 --> 01:40:55.580
MATT: "Every one of them. Otherwise they just go
ahead and steal from whoever's nearby. Isn't a

01:40:55.580 --> 01:40:58.189
"caravan that's made their way past Westruun in the
past week."

01:40:58.189 --> 01:41:09.409
LAURA: Well, here's the thing. We're trying to
help you. We're trying to find a way to (clicking)

01:41:09.409 --> 01:41:16.625
(choking) kill the fucks. You get me? Ill-kay the
agons-dray.

01:41:16.625 --> 01:41:19.868
MATT: Drops the fruit he has in his hand. "Please!
Please help us, please!"

01:41:19.868 --> 01:41:28.308
LAURA: Act natural! Keep picking, keep picking, keep
picking! We want to help you. We really, really,

01:41:28.308 --> 01:41:29.902
really want to help you.

01:41:29.902 --> 01:41:31.178
MATT: "They have my daughter."

01:41:31.178 --> 01:41:32.174
LAURA: Oh, shit.

01:41:32.174 --> 01:41:33.082
TALIESIN: Who's in charge?

01:41:33.082 --> 01:41:34.410
SAM: Who has your daughter?

01:41:34.410 --> 01:41:35.754
TALIESIN: No daughters right now.

01:41:35.754 --> 01:41:37.430
MATT: "Those beasts."

01:41:37.430 --> 01:41:38.982
SAM: Beasts? What beasts?

01:41:38.982 --> 01:41:41.484
LAURA: The guards? They're keeping your daughter?

01:41:41.484 --> 01:41:43.361
MATT: "Keeping a lot of people."

01:41:43.361 --> 01:41:45.002
TRAVIS: Do you know where they keep them?

01:41:45.002 --> 01:41:48.821
MATT: He leans over, nudges towards the direction
of the city.

01:41:48.821 --> 01:41:51.899
TALIESIN: Who's in charge?

01:41:51.899 --> 01:41:53.996
MATT: "I don't know his name."

01:41:53.996 --> 01:42:00.115
SAM: And that spot that we saw, just outside of
town, that's where gold is given to the dragon? Do

01:42:00.115 --> 01:42:01.866
you know anything of that?

01:42:01.866 --> 01:42:05.316
MATT: He looks a little confused. "I don't know.
They just take what we have."

01:42:05.316 --> 01:42:08.597
LIAM: The guy, you don't know his name. What does
he look like? Where have you seen him?

01:42:08.597 --> 01:42:10.336
LAURA: Keep your voice down!

01:42:10.336 --> 01:42:15.674
LIAM: I'm talking through Skype, so it's a little
more difficult for me!

01:42:15.674 --> 01:42:18.916
MATT: Who are you talking about?

01:42:18.916 --> 01:42:27.534
LIAM: The guy who's got your child. You don't know
his name. What does he look like? Where have you

01:42:27.534 --> 01:42:28.870
seen him?

01:42:28.870 --> 01:42:33.407
MATT: "I don't know. They're all different types,
I haven't seen the one who has them. They have them."

01:42:33.407 --> 01:42:36.587
LAURA: They, the guards? The people that serve the
dragon?

01:42:36.587 --> 01:42:40.227
MARISHA: What type of people are they interested
in?

01:42:40.227 --> 01:42:47.406
MATT: "Half-orcs-- Interested in? Whoever keeps
him at bay. I don't know, they take whoever seems

01:42:47.406 --> 01:42:51.891
"useful. Sometimes they take them and slaughter
them before us as a warning."

01:42:51.891 --> 01:42:53.670
MARISHA: Then why did they take your daughter?

01:42:53.670 --> 01:42:55.513
MATT: "I don't want to think about it."

01:42:55.513 --> 01:42:56.964
LAURA: To keep him working!

01:42:56.964 --> 01:43:02.321
TRAVIS: Look. Say we were really bored, and we
wanted to get you your family back.

01:43:02.321 --> 01:43:04.590
Where would you go?

01:43:04.590 --> 01:43:14.580
MATT: He points over to the city. "But there's one
right out..." And you see him pointing angrily

01:43:14.580 --> 01:43:18.586
around the corner, probably to the one that you
saw on the outskirts of the farm area you guys

01:43:18.586 --> 01:43:20.111
came down in.

01:43:20.111 --> 01:43:23.134
TALIESIN: Let's go to the city then, I suppose.

01:43:23.134 --> 01:43:24.038
SAM: Wait, what?

01:43:24.038 --> 01:43:25.146
LAURA: There's a dragon!

01:43:25.146 --> 01:43:28.049
SAM: To do what, to attack half-orcs that work for
a dragon?

01:43:28.049 --> 01:43:29.780
LAURA: Farmer. What's your name?

01:43:29.780 --> 01:43:31.179
MATT: "Reginald."

01:43:31.179 --> 01:43:36.657
LAURA: Reginald. Reginald, we want to help. How
often do you see the dragon flying around?

01:43:36.657 --> 01:43:40.845
MATT: "Once every couple days, maybe."

01:43:40.845 --> 01:43:43.459
LAURA: Once every couple days. When was the last
time you saw him?

01:43:43.459 --> 01:43:52.728
MATT: "About half a day ago. Dusk yesterday. I
don't know. We all stay inside around that time

01:43:52.728 --> 01:43:54.020
"just in case."

01:43:54.020 --> 01:43:58.231
MARISHA: Does he have patrols? Does he have
wyverns working for him as well, that fly around?

01:43:58.231 --> 01:44:04.440
MATT: "I haven't seen anything flying but the
dragon. There was a huge fight not more than a

01:44:04.440 --> 01:44:09.510
"week ago between these people and that thing. They
seem to have come to an accord."

01:44:09.510 --> 01:44:11.026
MARISHA: These people?

01:44:11.026 --> 01:44:12.553
SAM: The orcs?

01:44:12.553 --> 01:44:19.169
MATT: "The orcs, the whatever they are. The big
strong angry ones that keep taking all of our stuff."

01:44:19.169 --> 01:44:21.219
MARISHA: Oh, no.

01:44:21.219 --> 01:44:22.706
LAURA: (gasps)

01:44:22.706 --> 01:44:25.435
SAM: What, what?

01:44:25.435 --> 01:44:26.576
LAURA: What do they look like?

01:44:26.576 --> 01:44:28.466
MARISHA: Do they look like him, maybe?

01:44:28.466 --> 01:44:29.394
MATT: "Some do."

01:44:29.394 --> 01:44:30.904
TRAVIS: Oh, fuck me.

01:44:30.904 --> 01:44:35.343
LAURA: Shit.

01:44:35.343 --> 01:44:39.068
TRAVIS: Fuck, fuck, fuck!

01:44:39.068 --> 01:44:46.686
MATT: "The dragon came in and tore everything
down."

01:44:46.686 --> 01:44:50.008
TRAVIS: Damn it. Shit hammer.

01:44:50.008 --> 01:44:56.735
MATT: "Burned, liquefied, dissolved portions of
this city, people screaming. And then it left.

01:44:56.735 --> 01:44:58.691
"Both of them."

01:44:58.691 --> 01:45:04.384
SAM: You'll be okay. We're going to keep going.
Good luck.

01:45:04.384 --> 01:45:05.593
TRAVIS: No, wait, wait.

01:45:05.593 --> 01:45:06.675
LAURA: Scanlan!

01:45:06.675 --> 01:45:10.905
SAM: No, we have to keep going. We can't face
these goliaths and dragons and orc guards!

01:45:10.905 --> 01:45:12.576
This is craziness!

01:45:12.576 --> 01:45:14.358
MARISHA: One of the dragons was green?

01:45:14.358 --> 01:45:16.830
MATT: "From what we saw."

01:45:16.830 --> 01:45:17.936
LAURA: Green and a black.

01:45:17.936 --> 01:45:21.547
MATT: "Green and a black. I think a white one, but
that one kept going.

01:45:21.547 --> 01:45:23.102
SAM: I mean, we'll be fine.

01:45:23.102 --> 01:45:24.622
MARISHA: And the green one kept going?

01:45:24.622 --> 01:45:32.165
MATT: "All of them kept going. We thought we were
safe. We tried to re-gather. And then, within a

01:45:32.226 --> 01:45:40.565
"day, a bunch of these bastards came and took what
was left. Slaughtering, stealing."

01:45:40.565 --> 01:45:49.673
TRAVIS: We've got to go get his kid.

01:45:49.673 --> 01:45:52.496
LAURA: I feel like we have to help them. We have
to help them!

01:45:52.496 --> 01:45:59.638
MARISHA: Oh man. I feel like you all are talking
like I normally do, and I'm talking like Grog

01:45:59.638 --> 01:46:01.944
normally does. This is such a weird day.

01:46:01.944 --> 01:46:04.297
SAM: No, you're using way too many prepositions.

01:46:04.297 --> 01:46:07.119
TRAVIS: You said there are a lot of people that
look like me.

01:46:07.119 --> 01:46:14.980
MATT: "From what I've seen. I don't go too far
into town, they keep me out here, but I've seen a few."

01:46:14.980 --> 01:46:18.005
LAURA: I'm keeping an eye out for the guard. I
want to keep an eye out for the guard, make sure

01:46:18.005 --> 01:46:19.110
he's not noticing.

01:46:19.110 --> 01:46:20.103
MATT: Perception check.

01:46:20.103 --> 01:46:21.386
TRAVIS: They're in the city?

01:46:21.386 --> 01:46:22.555
MATT: "Most of them are, yeah."

01:46:22.555 --> 01:46:24.586
SAM: Were there six of them?

01:46:24.586 --> 01:46:27.392
LAURA: 17.

01:46:27.392 --> 01:46:30.430
MATT: 17, okay. You don't see the guard nearby.

01:46:30.430 --> 01:46:31.759
TRAVIS: We need that guard.

01:46:31.759 --> 01:46:34.828
MARISHA: What are we going to do right now?

01:46:34.828 --> 01:46:36.513
TRAVIS: We're going to ask him some questions.

01:46:36.513 --> 01:46:41.110
MARISHA: This is a coup on a grander scale than
Whitestone that we're talking about.

01:46:41.110 --> 01:46:42.877
TRAVIS: I just want the guard.

01:46:42.877 --> 01:46:44.801
SAM: Where's the guard? Can we see him?

01:46:44.801 --> 01:46:47.821
MATT: You guys want to try and find him?

01:46:47.821 --> 01:46:50.008
LAURA: Well, I saw him on the other side of the
thingie.

01:46:50.008 --> 01:46:56.839
MATT: Okay. You guys begin making your way towards
the direction that Vex saw the guard. You start

01:46:56.839 --> 01:47:01.479
pushing through the crop, making your way to the
edge, and at the point where these high crops end,

01:47:01.479 --> 01:47:06.809
it opens up into what looks like a heavy
root-based field. Potatoes, carrots, things that

01:47:06.809 --> 01:47:16.412
are beneath the ground. You guys see across the
way the two other farmers that were out there, the

01:47:16.412 --> 01:47:22.755
one that you saw being loosely beaten, they're
both filling satchels and emptying them into two

01:47:22.755 --> 01:47:33.054
larger carts that are put up to horses, one of
them a larger pony. You see what appears to be

01:47:33.054 --> 01:47:42.439
another hulking humanoid, taller than an average
person, skin slightly gray, a smattering of

01:47:42.439 --> 01:47:48.493
tattoos across the body. You recognize--

01:47:48.493 --> 01:47:54.263
LIAM: And best we can tell, he's the only guard?
The only one?

01:47:54.263 --> 01:47:56.033
TRAVIS: No, there's two. There's two.

01:47:56.033 --> 01:47:57.284
LAURA: I have an idea!

01:47:57.284 --> 01:47:59.483
SAM: Wait, he was about to tell us who it is.

01:47:59.483 --> 01:48:04.137
MATT: From what you can see, you actually
recognize this individual.

01:48:04.137 --> 01:48:06.768
TRAVIS: Fucking nipple tassels!

01:48:06.768 --> 01:48:16.703
MATT: This is an individual that you knew quite a
ways ago, a young goliath who was still about a

01:48:16.703 --> 01:48:25.876
half a foot shorter than you when you knew him. He
was named Horace, because he hated it, and Kevdak

01:48:25.876 --> 01:48:32.391
gave him this name and you actually, at some point
in the past, recall even giving Horace a good

01:48:32.391 --> 01:48:38.635
beating. A little of the smaller of the goliaths
you've encountered. This is years later. This punk

01:48:38.635 --> 01:48:47.125
kid, and he was kind of a punk, has grown up now,
and is still smaller than you by a size, but still

01:48:47.125 --> 01:48:51.961
seems to be every bit of an agitating little bitch
you remember, from the way that he's treating

01:48:51.961 --> 01:48:53.252
these people.

01:48:53.252 --> 01:48:54.620
TRAVIS: Is he holding anything?

01:48:54.620 --> 01:48:59.227
MATT: Not in his hand at the moment, no, but he
does have across the back what looks to be some

01:48:59.227 --> 01:49:01.136
sort of large blade sheathed.

01:49:01.136 --> 01:49:03.812
LAURA: Can I give my idea?

01:49:03.812 --> 01:49:04.922
TRAVIS: Yep.

01:49:04.922 --> 01:49:11.427
LAURA: What if we ask Reginald to call for help,
like he needs this fuck's help, and then he comes

01:49:11.427 --> 01:49:13.714
over, and then we spring a trap on him.

01:49:13.714 --> 01:49:15.407
MARISHA: That's not a bad idea.

01:49:15.407 --> 01:49:21.001
LAURA: I can use Hide in Plain Sight on us, and
hide us, and make us look like we're part of the crops.

01:49:21.049 --> 01:49:22.125
TRAVIS: I love it.

01:49:22.125 --> 01:49:23.358
LAURA: To set an ambush.

01:49:23.358 --> 01:49:24.313
TRAVIS: I love it.

01:49:24.313 --> 01:49:28.525
LIAM: And the goal is to question this guy or to
take him out? To question, yeah?

01:49:28.525 --> 01:49:33.577
TRAVIS: We're going to ask him questions, and if
he makes a peep-- Hold on, before we do that. Can

01:49:33.577 --> 01:49:35.339
you see the other guard that was out here?

01:49:35.339 --> 01:49:40.534
MATT: Glancing about, because it is a pretty open
area, you can see the secondary guard is walking

01:49:40.534 --> 01:49:44.040
away, looking to check one of the other
homesteads. There is a farmhouse.

01:49:44.040 --> 01:49:46.645
TRAVIS: It's like Kansas, right, it's flat?

01:49:46.645 --> 01:49:51.052
MATT: Yep, it's flat farmland on the outside of
Westruun. As soon as you break the south side of

01:49:51.052 --> 01:49:53.241
the Bramblewood, it's just plain.

01:49:53.241 --> 01:49:57.706
TRAVIS: What distance would you put him at? How
far away would you put him? 100 yards?

01:49:57.706 --> 01:49:59.179
LAURA: The other guard?

01:49:59.179 --> 01:50:01.398
MATT: I'd say the other guard's probably a good
400 feet.

01:50:01.398 --> 01:50:02.672
TRAVIS: Do it.

01:50:02.672 --> 01:50:04.013
LAURA: Yeah?

01:50:04.013 --> 01:50:04.925
TRAVIS: Do it.

01:50:04.925 --> 01:50:07.298
LAURA: Can I take a minute to camouflage us and
then tell Reginald to call him over?

01:50:07.298 --> 01:50:08.084
MATT: Yeah.

01:50:08.084 --> 01:50:11.766
TRAVIS: When he comes over, I grab him. Nobody do
anything that's loud.

01:50:11.766 --> 01:50:13.539
LAURA: Got it.

01:50:13.539 --> 01:50:21.920
MATT: Okay. So, as you all take a moment, stepping
into parts of the stalks of the edge of this land,

01:50:21.920 --> 01:50:28.158
Vex, you go ahead and start taking up leaves,
patches of dirt, mud from freshly watered ground,

01:50:28.158 --> 01:50:33.176
and you start smattering the rest of the group
with it. You guys are going full Arnold from

01:50:33.176 --> 01:50:36.205
Predator. You begin to blend into the vicinity.

01:50:36.205 --> 01:50:42.517
MARISHA: Question. Could I work with Percy?

01:50:42.517 --> 01:50:44.219
TALIESIN: Yes?

01:50:44.219 --> 01:50:55.050
MARISHA: I have Entangle learned today. Could we
fashion a quick Entangle trap, where when the guy

01:50:55.050 --> 01:50:59.130
steps into it he'll be entangled? Or I could maybe
just be prepared for it?

01:50:59.130 --> 01:51:00.618
MATT: You can be prepared for it when it happens.

01:51:00.618 --> 01:51:01.656
MARISHA: I'll be prepared for it.

01:51:01.656 --> 01:51:05.847
TALIESIN: I'm going to draw her a little sketch of
something that would spring, that you can make out

01:51:05.847 --> 01:51:06.822
of wood.

01:51:06.822 --> 01:51:11.880
MATT: The spell expends when cast, so it's more of
waiting to release it. To make it as part of a set

01:51:11.880 --> 01:51:15.426
trap, that would be a consumable trap you would
have to construct.

01:51:15.426 --> 01:51:18.747
MARISHA: All right. I'll just be prepped with it.

01:51:18.747 --> 01:51:22.077
MATT: Okay. So you guys all have hidden.

01:51:22.077 --> 01:51:24.161
LAURA: Reginald.

01:51:24.161 --> 01:51:27.823
MATT: He's behind you guys, watching all of this
happen. "Yes?"

01:51:27.823 --> 01:51:32.979
LAURA: Act like you're still picking and act like
you hurt your ankle, and call for help from that

01:51:32.979 --> 01:51:35.381
guard over there. We'll protect you.

01:51:35.381 --> 01:51:36.596
MATT: "Promise?"

01:51:36.596 --> 01:51:38.522
TRAVIS: Yeah, I promise.

01:51:38.522 --> 01:51:42.923
MARISHA: And try and maybe keep a bit of a
distance, because I'm going to be doing a trap

01:51:42.923 --> 01:51:46.057
here. It's going to be 20 feet. You don't want to
be in it.

01:51:46.057 --> 01:51:47.490
LAURA: Just step back and call for help.

01:51:47.490 --> 01:51:48.903
MARISHA: Just step back, all right?

01:51:48.903 --> 01:51:55.346
MATT: So you guys are all working on the very edge
of where these crop fields begin. Reginald pushes

01:51:55.346 --> 01:52:05.588
through a little bit, and goes, "Ow! Ow! Ow!" You
hear in the distance a voice go, "Hey you! What's

01:52:05.588 --> 01:52:13.405
"your problem?" He goes, "My ankle!" And he starts
hobbling into the crop. "You shut your trap! It's

01:52:13.405 --> 01:52:18.774
"your fucking ankle! What's that stupid-- Oh, you--"
(grunts) He starts lumbering up. "I'm going to

01:52:18.774 --> 01:52:23.725
"teach you about letting a peep out of that stupid
maw of yours! I'm going to beat that face so hard

01:52:23.725 --> 01:52:26.791
"it can't make a noise ever again! Stupid git!"

01:52:26.791 --> 01:52:27.918
TALIESIN: And now.

01:52:27.918 --> 01:52:29.593
MARISHA: (whoosh)

01:52:29.593 --> 01:52:32.548
LAURA: The minute he's in the high crops so he's
out of visual from the other guard.

01:52:32.548 --> 01:52:35.369
MATT: Okay. So as soon as he steps into the high
crop area.

01:52:35.369 --> 01:52:37.800
MARISHA: I'm waiting for Percy's cue.

01:52:37.800 --> 01:52:39.229
TALIESIN: Now!

01:52:39.229 --> 01:52:42.596
MATT: All right. So what are the specifics of the
Entanglement spell?

01:52:42.596 --> 01:52:44.659
MARISHA: 20 feet.

01:52:44.659 --> 01:52:52.293
SAM: It always works and it catches whoever you
want!

01:52:52.293 --> 01:52:53.836
MARISHA: It always works...

01:52:53.836 --> 01:53:00.809
MATT: All of a sudden all of the crops, all of the
large stalks and vines start (whoosh) wrapping

01:53:00.809 --> 01:53:02.139
around his body.

01:53:02.139 --> 01:53:03.236
LAURA: Shit, mother bitch!

01:53:03.236 --> 01:53:04.292
SAM: What's wrong?

01:53:04.292 --> 01:53:05.518
LAURA: That's a bit obvious.

01:53:05.518 --> 01:53:06.439
MARISHA: Is it obvious?

01:53:06.439 --> 01:53:09.784
MATT: It's once he's inside the area, so it's not
like the wall on the outside.

01:53:09.784 --> 01:53:13.212
LAURA: Okay. I was picturing all the plants
suddenly losing their shit.

01:53:13.212 --> 01:53:15.017
MATT: No, just the ones in the immediate
vicinity.

01:53:15.017 --> 01:53:16.850
SAM: Like a used car lot?

01:53:16.850 --> 01:53:19.789
MATT: Okay, so he's going to attempt to make a
strength saving throw.

01:53:19.789 --> 01:53:23.339
LIAM: I'm going to squat at the edge of the high
crops and keep an eye on the other guard who was

01:53:23.339 --> 01:53:25.492
walking off just to make sure he's oblivious.

01:53:25.492 --> 01:53:31.286
MATT: Make a perception check, if you could, Vax.
Surprised so he has disadvantage on the saving

01:53:31.286 --> 01:53:32.959
throw. What's the DC?

01:53:32.959 --> 01:53:34.796
MARISHA: Me? 19.

01:53:34.796 --> 01:53:38.361
MATT: 19? That's a failure. All right, and what?

01:53:38.361 --> 01:53:39.550
LIAM: 28.

01:53:39.550 --> 01:53:43.136
MATT: 28! Yeah, Vax, keeping an eye, the guard
doesn't seem to have kept notice and continues

01:53:43.136 --> 01:53:49.394
walking off towards the distant farmhouse. The
plants all wrap around his body and he:

01:53:49.394 --> 01:53:50.832
"What's this? Stupid-- "

01:53:50.832 --> 01:53:55.871
TRAVIS: I run over and I tackle him, knock him to
the ground, put my hand over his mouth, punch him

01:53:55.871 --> 01:54:04.259
in the forehead. Punch him again. Punch him a
third time. And I barely lift my hand.

01:54:04.259 --> 01:54:06.789
MATT: "You motherfucker-- "

01:54:06.789 --> 01:54:08.368
TRAVIS: Punch him again.

01:54:08.368 --> 01:54:11.990
MATT: At this point, now he's got blood pouring
out of the corner of the eye. One eye has gone a

01:54:11.990 --> 01:54:16.323
little red from burst vessels. You can see it
starting to swell up already. Blood's now pouring

01:54:16.323 --> 01:54:20.258
out the side of the nose where you've hit it, and
he's still fighting even though the plants have

01:54:20.258 --> 01:54:24.349
kept him entangled. As soon as the calm comes to
him (heavy breathing).

01:54:24.349 --> 01:54:26.958
TRAVIS: (sing-song) Horace.

01:54:26.958 --> 01:54:34.851
MATT: The eyes go wide and all the tension in the
body loosens. "Fucking hell."

01:54:34.851 --> 01:54:36.323
TRAVIS: (muffled) Fucking hell.

01:54:36.323 --> 01:54:39.302
MATT: You're still holding his face? (muffled)
"Fucking hell."

01:54:39.302 --> 01:54:48.275
TRAVIS: I'm going to move my hand. If you make a
sound, wash, rinse, repeat, yeah? Nod.

01:54:48.275 --> 01:54:50.365
Shut the fuck up.

01:54:50.365 --> 01:54:56.899
MATT: He spits a couple teeth out the side of his
mouth.

01:54:56.899 --> 01:54:59.887
TRAVIS: You're looking big.

01:54:59.887 --> 01:55:07.911
MATT: "You're supposed to be dead. You're supposed
to be fucking dead. I watched you beaten to death.

01:55:07.911 --> 01:55:10.143
"Why the fuck are you still alive?"

01:55:10.143 --> 01:55:16.737
TRAVIS: Yeah, right. Funny thing about me. So
look, who else is out in this field with you right now?

01:55:16.737 --> 01:55:29.976
MATT: "No one. It's me and Cole, but Cole's
heading back to the city. We have other ones

01:55:29.976 --> 01:55:33.934
"passed out around, but most of them stay in town,
especially during the day. That's where the

01:55:33.934 --> 01:55:36.367
"festivities are."

01:55:36.417 --> 01:55:38.078
LAURA: Festivities?

01:55:38.078 --> 01:55:43.201
MATT: "Do you want back in? You're alive, man. Now's
the time. It's a good time for the herd."

01:55:43.201 --> 01:55:48.914
TRAVIS: Yeah, no I want back in, for sure. That's
what I've come here for: to come back in. But

01:55:48.914 --> 01:55:56.221
here's the thing. It's a bit of a surprise, right?
Other people haven't seen me. You like a good

01:55:56.221 --> 01:55:57.841
surprise, right, Horace?

01:55:57.841 --> 01:56:00.736
MATT: "Yeah?"

01:56:00.736 --> 01:56:06.371
TRAVIS: Yeah. I thought you might. Here's my
question: have you seen my cousin Zanror?

01:56:06.371 --> 01:56:07.994
Is he in the city?

01:56:07.994 --> 01:56:09.460
MATT: "Probably, aye."

01:56:09.460 --> 01:56:14.483
TRAVIS: Right. And what about Kevdak?

01:56:14.483 --> 01:56:21.154
MATT: "Kevdak stays in the city, as well. Up at
the old Margrave's place, actually. Turned it into

01:56:21.154 --> 01:56:24.608
"his palace. Want me to take you?"

01:56:24.608 --> 01:56:30.563
TALIESIN: Before we go any further, what do I roll
if I want to find out if Horace really does like

01:56:30.563 --> 01:56:33.901
surprises? I'm not kidding.

01:56:33.901 --> 01:56:37.061
MATT: Make an insight check. All of you guys are
still hidden, by the way, unless you want

01:56:37.061 --> 01:56:38.291
to do something.

01:56:38.291 --> 01:56:39.364
TALIESIN: No, I'm just watching.

01:56:39.364 --> 01:56:41.870
LAURA: And we gained another plus ten, so now we
have plus 20 to all of our stealth, by the way,

01:56:41.870 --> 01:56:43.283
from that Hide in Plain Sight.

01:56:43.283 --> 01:56:44.747
SAM: Wait, what?

01:56:44.747 --> 01:56:48.718
LAURA: We have Pass Without a Trace, which adds
plus ten, Hide in Plain Sight adds plus ten.

01:56:48.718 --> 01:56:50.844
That's what I camouflaged us fucking for.

01:56:50.844 --> 01:56:52.788
SAM: How do you have all these things?

01:56:52.788 --> 01:56:56.967
MATT: All of you guys make another stealth check
with plus 20.

01:56:56.967 --> 01:57:04.308
MARISHA: Natural 20, so 40. Actually, I have a
stealth of seven.

01:57:04.308 --> 01:57:05.599
LAURA: 46.

01:57:05.599 --> 01:57:06.937
TALIESIN: 43.

01:57:06.937 --> 01:57:08.550
MARISHA: 47.

01:57:08.550 --> 01:57:12.205
MATT: You guys have never been seen.
Retroactively, no one's ever seen you in your

01:57:12.205 --> 01:57:13.473
entire lives.

01:57:13.473 --> 01:57:16.048
TALIESIN: I could fire my gun, at this point, and
they'd be like, oh, rain's coming.

01:57:16.048 --> 01:57:19.603
MATT: If it was Bad News, it would still probably
break stealth.

01:57:19.603 --> 01:57:20.939
TALIESIN: Well, if it was Bad News, yeah.

01:57:20.939 --> 01:57:30.501
MATT: Okay, unless you rolled a one. Yeah, no.
(laughs) Horace hasn't seen anyone.

01:57:30.501 --> 01:57:34.875
"I could take you in."

01:57:34.875 --> 01:57:39.406
TRAVIS: Right, listen. I was going to pounce on
this poor farmer over here, but I saw you were

01:57:39.406 --> 01:57:42.818
obviously keeping your eye on him. Why are you
doing that?

01:57:42.818 --> 01:57:45.658
MATT: "Which one are you talking about? Reggie?"

01:57:45.658 --> 01:57:47.856
TRAVIS: Yeah. Old Broken Foot over here.

01:57:47.856 --> 01:57:55.113
MATT: (laughs) "He's a little bitch, that one is.
No, but you know what? I caught him sniffing

01:57:55.113 --> 01:57:57.516
"around. I think he's keeping some gold hidden."

01:57:57.516 --> 01:58:00.399
TRAVIS: Really? Gold? This poor farmer?

01:58:00.399 --> 01:58:01.800
MATT: "Twisted his arm a couple of times."

01:58:01.800 --> 01:58:02.998
TRAVIS: Have you?

01:58:02.998 --> 01:58:06.504
MATT: "We could do this for old times' sake. Each
take an arm, pull until he tells us."

01:58:06.504 --> 01:58:08.292
TRAVIS: Oh, like wishbone?

01:58:08.292 --> 01:58:09.623
MATT: "Yeah."

01:58:09.623 --> 01:58:15.748
TRAVIS: Yeah, that does sound like a good idea.
Here's my thing. Why are you guys in this city?

01:58:15.748 --> 01:58:20.796
It's not really our thing to be in civilized
places.

01:58:20.796 --> 01:58:27.915
MATT: "Here's the thing. Let me get loose here for
a minute. I'm feeling a bit uncomfortable."

01:58:27.915 --> 01:58:30.305
TRAVIS: No, I don't think I will, Horace.

01:58:30.305 --> 01:58:41.803
MATT: "Okay. We were heading up north. We took out
a small caravan just south of the road cuts, near

01:58:41.803 --> 01:58:46.807
"the Silvercut Way, and all of a sudden out of the
sky, we saw these streaking dragons come through.

01:58:46.807 --> 01:58:53.523
"Largest I've ever seen. Dangerous as the day's
long. So we fled. We watched them come here and

01:58:53.523 --> 01:59:00.773
"tear into this city. Rend it, destroy it, smoke
and flames and ice and all sorts of craziness. And

01:59:00.773 --> 01:59:07.863
"they kept going. We figured, dragons come, didn't
take the spoils, there's plenty of spoils for us.

01:59:07.863 --> 01:59:13.526
"More than we could ever dream of. Most of it's
pretty well-guarded, but there couldn't be much

01:59:13.526 --> 01:59:19.416
"left over there. So we gathered up who we had, and
mind you, the herd's swelled a bit since you left,

01:59:19.416 --> 01:59:30.278
"my friend. We conquered another wandering tribe
last year. Zanror took the head of their leader

01:59:30.278 --> 01:59:33.807
"and commanded them to join. We're about a hundred
strong these days."

01:59:33.807 --> 01:59:35.362
TRAVIS: Jesus.

01:59:35.362 --> 01:59:36.800
MARISHA: Fuck.

01:59:36.800 --> 01:59:44.385
MATT: "Pecking order. Still us goliaths at the
top. We got all sorts of other piddly men."

01:59:44.385 --> 01:59:45.533
TRAVIS: Really?

01:59:45.533 --> 01:59:52.683
MATT: "Half-men, half-orcs. A few brutalized elves
here and there. They make cooking easy. Anyway, we

01:59:52.683 --> 01:59:59.404
"took that moment and we rushed into the town. Took
it before the day was over. Killed all who didn't

01:59:59.404 --> 02:00:09.897
"bow before Kevdak himself. Days of revelry ensued,
my friend. Oh, you missed out. Wine, women, gold.

02:00:09.897 --> 02:00:21.520
"We took what we wanted until one of them dragons
came back. Black one. Scary. Killed a lot of us.

02:00:21.520 --> 02:00:27.820
"We weren't so much a hundred strong then, but by
the end of that we had 50 or 60 to our name before

02:00:27.820 --> 02:00:38.232
"the anger finally stopped. Kevdak bent a knee and
made an offering to this dragon."

02:00:38.232 --> 02:00:39.750
TRAVIS: Kevdak did?

02:00:39.750 --> 02:00:52.033
MATT: "I know. But trust me, you see a beast this
size... it was survival through a mutual discussion, if you

02:00:52.033 --> 02:01:00.977
"will. Promised our might to its worship, gathered
our spoils, deliver it every now and then. We got

02:01:00.977 --> 02:01:08.826
"to have the leftovers. We rule the city in its
stead. Not a bad deal. Doesn't watch. We leave it

02:01:08.826 --> 02:01:15.706
"what we find-- most of it, at least, we keep a
little on the side-- and we live like kings here.

02:01:15.706 --> 02:01:19.002
"Westruun is now property of the herd."

02:01:19.002 --> 02:01:25.562
TRAVIS: Well, it sounds really good.

02:01:25.562 --> 02:01:31.624
MATT: "You've missed out, and there's quite a few
openings now, since we've lost a few of the less

02:01:31.624 --> 02:01:35.931
"than strong folk. You look strapping. I'm sure
Kevdak would be more than happy to have you back."

02:01:35.931 --> 02:01:38.282
TRAVIS: I do. I've actually brought a few gifts.

02:01:38.282 --> 02:01:40.721
LAURA: (whispering) I notch an arrow.

02:01:40.721 --> 02:01:43.287
TRAVIS: I unsheathe Craven Edge.

02:01:43.287 --> 02:01:46.257
MATT: "That's a good blade."

02:01:46.257 --> 02:01:51.212
TRAVIS: Isn't it. And I ask out loud, are you
hungry?

02:01:51.212 --> 02:02:02.270
MATT: "It's been probably half a day since
breakfast. Aye. Why?" His expression begins to

02:02:02.270 --> 02:02:06.245
shift as realization begins to dawn on his face.

02:02:06.245 --> 02:02:10.174
TRAVIS: I pull it back. I stick the point in
between his ribcage, and I drive it up through him.

02:02:10.174 --> 02:02:12.251
(shocked noises)

02:02:12.251 --> 02:02:18.319
MATT: Before he can say a word-- he tries to speak
through the pain, but it's met with the gurgle as

02:02:18.319 --> 02:02:22.745
various bodily fluids fill the inside of his lungs
and throat.

02:02:22.745 --> 02:02:24.622
TRAVIS: Oh, more?

02:02:24.622 --> 02:02:30.265
MATT: The blade, now, you can see (choking noise)
peeks through the back of the mouth as his eyes go

02:02:30.265 --> 02:02:35.917
ever so dull, the rest of the blood flow pouring
out the sides of his mouth.

02:02:35.917 --> 02:02:39.168
TRAVIS: Pity that, acid reflux.

02:02:39.168 --> 02:02:44.980
LAURA: Grog! Oh shit. Good job, there.

02:02:44.980 --> 02:02:46.371
MARISHA: Vex?

02:02:46.371 --> 02:02:51.783
MATT: As this is happening, the blood that has
filled the mouth begins to seep back into the

02:02:51.783 --> 02:02:58.221
mouth. The trails are still there, but what was
once filled to the brim has been slowly recessed,

02:02:58.221 --> 02:03:07.935
swallowed. Not by the unmoving body of Horace, but
the dark blade itself now drawing from the inside.

02:03:07.935 --> 02:03:11.771
LAURA: What the fuck is that sword, Grog?

02:03:11.771 --> 02:03:13.108
TRAVIS: What?

02:03:13.108 --> 02:03:14.848
LAURA: What is your sword doing?

02:03:14.848 --> 02:03:22.054
TRAVIS: Nothing. It takes in the strength of who
it slays.

02:03:22.054 --> 02:03:24.191
LAURA: It takes in the blood?

02:03:24.191 --> 02:03:26.940
TRAVIS: Did it do that?

02:03:26.940 --> 02:03:28.374
LAURA: Grog.

02:03:28.374 --> 02:03:29.654
TRAVIS: What?

02:03:29.654 --> 02:03:34.340
SAM: You killed him. Was he related to you in some
way?

02:03:34.340 --> 02:03:40.283
TRAVIS: I don't know. I remember him. He was
always a little shit.

02:03:40.283 --> 02:03:45.047
MARISHA: Grog, do you remember killing him five
seconds ago?

02:03:45.047 --> 02:03:46.408
TRAVIS: Who?

02:03:46.408 --> 02:03:49.133
MARISHA: Oh no. You guys.

02:03:49.133 --> 02:03:50.656
LAURA: The little dude. Your little friend?

02:03:50.656 --> 02:03:52.047
TRAVIS: Horace?

02:03:52.047 --> 02:03:54.260
LAURA: You killed him. On purpose?

02:03:54.260 --> 02:03:55.181
TRAVIS: Sure.

02:03:55.181 --> 02:03:56.202
LAURA: You wanted to?

02:03:56.202 --> 02:03:57.822
TRAVIS: Yeah, he was going to go tell about us.

02:03:57.822 --> 02:03:59.653
MARISHA: You were conscious of that?

02:03:59.653 --> 02:04:00.970
TRAVIS: What?

02:04:00.970 --> 02:04:02.533
MARISHA: Is it me?

02:04:02.533 --> 02:04:04.816
SAM: You're using too-big words.

02:04:04.816 --> 02:04:14.769
TRAVIS: So listen, right? Either we stay and do
some recon, or we take out the other guy that's

02:04:14.769 --> 02:04:23.872
walking back to the city. Really shouldn't be a
problem. But if they're all in there, 50 strong, I

02:04:23.872 --> 02:04:30.073
don't think we're quite ready for that. The sneaky
fucks in our group could go take a look, if you're

02:04:30.073 --> 02:04:31.387
feeling randy.

02:04:31.387 --> 02:04:34.530
SAM: What would be our mission?

02:04:34.530 --> 02:04:36.920
TRAVIS: Info only.

02:04:36.920 --> 02:04:42.835
SAM: You killed this one quite easily.

02:04:42.835 --> 02:04:44.300
MARISHA: Very easily.

02:04:44.300 --> 02:04:47.444
TRAVIS: Yeah, but that's because we did it as a
group.

02:04:47.444 --> 02:04:48.580
MARISHA: Did we?

02:04:48.580 --> 02:04:52.678
LAURA: Could we wait until nightfall?

02:04:52.678 --> 02:04:57.404
SAM: I'm going to check out his body. See if
there's any booty on his body.

02:04:57.404 --> 02:05:03.267
LAURA: Well, as soon as we move, we won't be
camouflaged in this crop anymore. We'll lose that.

02:05:03.267 --> 02:05:05.021
MARISHA: Yeah, we won't look like crops.

02:05:05.021 --> 02:05:16.526
MATT: As the stalks unwind, leaving his defiled
body and you draw the blade free, Scanlan, you

02:05:16.526 --> 02:05:23.339
find, across the body, there is a simple, slightly
chipped-but-still-functional greatsword that was

02:05:23.339 --> 02:05:32.051
sheathed in the back, wrapped in a haphazard hide
that functioned as a scabbard. Mostly just leather

02:05:32.051 --> 02:05:38.146
pants, a few furs, looks to be a bone necklace and
a bone bracelet around the wrist which looks to be

02:05:38.146 --> 02:05:45.967
teeth, human teeth. About 27 gold pieces in total
change.

02:05:45.967 --> 02:05:48.607
TRAVIS: How far are we from the city here?

02:05:48.607 --> 02:05:51.989
MATT: About a five-minute walk.

02:05:51.989 --> 02:05:53.765
TRAVIS: Five-minute walk. That's not far.

02:05:53.765 --> 02:05:57.256
LAURA: Keyleth, can you use your powers to suck
him into the ground so that nobody sees him?

02:05:57.256 --> 02:06:02.288
TALIESIN: I honestly don't think they're going to
find him, anyway.

02:06:02.288 --> 02:06:07.123
LAURA: I use my abilities and try to camouflage
the body so that nobody finds him.

02:06:07.123 --> 02:06:12.473
MATT: You pull him up into one of the walls of the
plant stalks and set him in there, mounding up

02:06:12.473 --> 02:06:15.494
whatever bits of fallen leaves and dirt you can.
He's pretty well-hidden.

02:06:15.494 --> 02:06:21.997
MARISHA: I use my Druidcraft to grow some flowers
on top of the dirt.

02:06:21.997 --> 02:06:27.103
MATT: Some flowers come up there. Some of the
local leaves from the stalks bend down and help

02:06:27.103 --> 02:06:28.152
cover him up.

02:06:28.152 --> 02:06:30.298
TALIESIN: Leave a couple of his human teeth that
he's collected--

02:06:30.298 --> 02:06:32.715
SAM: I'll leave all his human teeth, I'm not
gonna take that shit.

02:06:32.715 --> 02:06:37.737
MARISHA: Great, so very successful trip. Stopping
down.

02:06:37.737 --> 02:06:39.516
LAURA: Reggie?

02:06:39.516 --> 02:06:41.465
LIAM: His partner's still long-gone.

02:06:41.465 --> 02:06:42.516
TRAVIS: That guard?

02:06:42.516 --> 02:06:43.516
LAURA: The other guard, yeah?

02:06:43.516 --> 02:06:48.018
MATT: The guard's gone. Reggie's still sitting
there, watched this whole thing happen. Looking at

02:06:48.018 --> 02:06:53.847
you and goes, "You did good. You did good."

02:06:53.847 --> 02:06:57.497
TRAVIS: I know I did. Just imagine what we'll do
to the rest of them.

02:06:57.497 --> 02:07:00.817
MATT: "Thank you. Thank you."

02:07:00.817 --> 02:07:04.794
SAM: Are we going to do anything to the rest of
them?

02:07:04.794 --> 02:07:06.091
LAURA: Right now?

02:07:06.091 --> 02:07:07.702
TALIESIN: I think we're going to go take a look.

02:07:07.702 --> 02:07:14.556
TRAVIS: I don't mind you taking a look, but &lt;i&gt;be
careful&lt;/i&gt;.

02:07:14.556 --> 02:07:19.716
TALIESIN: We can also still turn into mist.

02:07:19.716 --> 02:07:21.155
MARISHA: We can.

02:07:21.155 --> 02:07:22.856
LAURA: They can't hurt us when we're mist.

02:07:22.856 --> 02:07:25.327
SAM: We can all mist and go into the city and
check it out.

02:07:25.327 --> 02:07:26.373
LAURA: See what we see.

02:07:26.373 --> 02:07:27.369
TALIESIN: Be fast and stealthy.

02:07:27.369 --> 02:07:29.209
LAURA: Can we stealth while we're misting?

02:07:29.209 --> 02:07:31.860
SAM: It doesn't matter if they see us, they can't
do anything to us.

02:07:31.860 --> 02:07:37.025
MATT: Yeah, it would be being conscious of the
cloud patterns in the sky, moving with the wind in

02:07:37.025 --> 02:07:42.466
a way where you become less noticeable as something
strange. So it's possible.

02:07:42.466 --> 02:07:45.680
LAURA: Let's try that, so we can spy on the city!
Get closer in.

02:07:45.680 --> 02:07:47.307
TRAVIS: It feels kind of cheap.

02:07:47.307 --> 02:07:49.058
LAURA: Why?

02:07:49.058 --> 02:07:53.029
TRAVIS: I don't know.

02:07:53.029 --> 02:07:58.140
LAURA: At least if we go in, Grog, we can see what
we're up against.

02:07:58.140 --> 02:08:06.463
TRAVIS: Yeah, but can't we use our eyes? Just as
they are. Do we have to turn to smoke this time?

02:08:06.463 --> 02:08:11.254
MARISHA: Why would we not?

02:08:11.254 --> 02:08:13.964
TRAVIS: It feels a little cowardly.

02:08:13.964 --> 02:08:16.713
LAURA: It's not cowardly, Grog, it's safe.

02:08:16.713 --> 02:08:18.110
SAM: You can stay behind.

02:08:18.110 --> 02:08:25.697
LIAM: What if Vex and I went as mist, just the two
of us, quickly? Just the two of us.

02:08:25.697 --> 02:08:27.575
TRAVIS: Yeah, that's fine.

02:08:27.575 --> 02:08:32.112
TALIESIN: I may join you two for this as well.

02:08:32.112 --> 02:08:33.300
LAURA: All right.

02:08:33.300 --> 02:08:39.401
MARISHA: And what are the rest of us going to do?
Just wait? Me, Scanlan, and Grog?

02:08:39.401 --> 02:08:43.317
TRAVIS: You can turn into a cloud, and float in
there, and see what you want to see, but I'm not

02:08:43.317 --> 02:08:48.876
turning into mist when my herd is inside that
city. If I go in, I'm going in.

02:08:48.876 --> 02:08:52.199
SAM: As Grog.

02:08:52.199 --> 02:08:53.524
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:08:53.524 --> 02:08:56.000
MARISHA: So why don't we just not go in right
now?

02:08:56.000 --> 02:09:00.717
SAM: Why don't you all go in, I'll stay back with
Grog.

02:09:00.717 --> 02:09:03.235
TRAVIS: Thank you.

02:09:03.235 --> 02:09:05.160
LAURA: All right.

02:09:05.160 --> 02:09:08.218
TALIESIN: Not crazy-ish.

02:09:08.218 --> 02:09:16.505
MATT: All right, the four of you convert into mist
form, crest up over the edge and start drifting

02:09:16.505 --> 02:09:25.511
your way over the top of Westruun, leaving
Scanlan, Grog, and Reginald amongst the crops.

02:09:25.511 --> 02:09:28.659
TRAVIS: Reginald, you want some ale?

02:09:28.659 --> 02:09:30.979
MATT: "Do you have some?"

02:09:30.979 --> 02:09:36.075
TRAVIS: No, I do, yeah, hold on. Get the cask out,
pour him a cup.

02:09:36.075 --> 02:09:40.219
MATT: He drinks thirstily, both because he seems
genuinely thirsty, and second, it seems like he

02:09:40.219 --> 02:09:41.926
could use a long, hard drink.

02:09:41.926 --> 02:09:44.358
TRAVIS: Pace yourself, son, there's a lot that's
here.

02:09:44.358 --> 02:09:48.113
MATT: "I've been drinking longer than you've been
alive, friend." Just (guzzles).

02:09:48.113 --> 02:09:50.139
TRAVIS: Wow. Another?

02:09:50.139 --> 02:09:51.795
MATT: "Yeah."

02:09:51.795 --> 02:09:53.301
TRAVIS: I'll keep them coming.

02:09:53.301 --> 02:09:57.254
MATT: And, for that, we'll take a quick break,
come back here. See you guys here in a few

02:09:57.254 --> 02:10:01.844
minutes, and we'll continue this story. See you in
a minute!

02:10:01.844 --> 02:26:57.507
[break]

02:26:57.560 --> 02:26:58.863
TALIESIN: Cock goblin.

02:26:58.863 --> 02:27:04.721
MATT: Welcome back! Ha ha, they got it on stream!
Sorry, Liam, we're not as good as you are at it.

02:27:04.721 --> 02:27:08.947
So, guys, quick note before we get back into the
game. Apparently, the shirt link wasn't working

02:27:08.995 --> 02:27:14.005
earlier, it is working now. They got it
functional, so go ahead and hop on now while you

02:27:14.005 --> 02:27:22.861
can. Returning from the break, as Grog and Scanlan
sit, waiting to hear back from the rest of the

02:27:22.861 --> 02:27:28.803
team, traversing over towards Westruun, seeking
information in their mist forms. The two of you

02:27:28.803 --> 02:27:34.520
remain behind. The four of you guys who are in
mist form, where are you going?

02:27:34.520 --> 02:27:43.253
LAURA: Can we stealthily head towards a pocket of
people? Do we see a crowd of people being held?

02:27:43.253 --> 02:27:46.278
MATT: This is your mist form?

02:27:46.278 --> 02:27:47.493
LAURA: This is my mist form.

02:27:47.493 --> 02:27:49.756
MATT: Ocean. I like it. I'd like you guys to make
stealth checks.

02:27:49.756 --> 02:27:51.173
LAURA: Stealth checks!

02:27:51.173 --> 02:27:53.807
MARISHA: Do we still have Pass Without a Trace?

02:27:53.807 --> 02:27:54.888
LAURA: Yes!

02:27:54.888 --> 02:28:00.644
39.

02:28:00.644 --> 02:28:02.533
LIAM: 42.

02:28:02.533 --> 02:28:03.965
TALIESIN: 33.

02:28:03.965 --> 02:28:05.224
MARISHA: 24.

02:28:05.224 --> 02:28:15.253
MATT: You guys make your way across the rest of
the fields. You head over Cole, you can see

02:28:15.253 --> 02:28:21.110
walking his way to the outside of the western side
of the city. You come towards the bottom of the

02:28:21.110 --> 02:28:28.619
gate. You can see the rigid, small fence structure
you noticed when you were far away from the city

02:28:28.619 --> 02:28:36.997
becomes more clearly visible. It is a series of
spears and pikes that are set up as a barrier or a

02:28:36.997 --> 02:28:43.273
barricade to the outside world to Westruun. You do
see adorned atop a number of them a few heads,

02:28:43.273 --> 02:28:46.458
varying sizes, various people, various ages.

02:28:46.458 --> 02:28:49.658
MARISHA: Does this appear to be goliath-built?

02:28:49.658 --> 02:28:53.478
MATT: It's hard to say. It looks built.

02:28:53.478 --> 02:28:56.777
LAURA: And the spikes are facing inward towards
the city, or outward?

02:28:56.777 --> 02:29:02.818
MATT: Outwards. There are breaks in it, but
essentially it's partially a pseudo-defense

02:29:02.818 --> 02:29:06.494
mechanism, it's more as a warning, it's a point of
intimidation.

02:29:06.494 --> 02:29:11.504
MARISHA: So does it look pretty jerry-rigged?

02:29:11.504 --> 02:29:17.432
MATT: Yeah. It's not anything too classically
designed.

02:29:17.432 --> 02:29:20.415
LIAM: No flying buttresses?

02:29:20.415 --> 02:29:22.252
MATT: Not quite, no.

02:29:22.252 --> 02:29:28.244
TALIESIN: Doric columns, oh my &lt;i&gt;god&lt;/i&gt;! Awful!
Tacky!

02:29:28.244 --> 02:29:32.784
MATT: You coast over the outside wall and glance
down within. You can see there are people

02:29:32.784 --> 02:29:42.268
wandering the town, townsfolk that are out in the
streets. Many of them are in pairs or groups, two

02:29:42.268 --> 02:29:49.745
to four people, appear to be traveling from
one place to another. Most of them are accompanied

02:29:49.745 --> 02:29:57.344
by one or two armed individuals. Some of the
people have chains around their neck. You do see a

02:29:57.344 --> 02:30:02.527
number of these buildings are in ruins, patchwork
places. Some are just crushed. Some appear to have

02:30:02.527 --> 02:30:08.990
been melted down, like the wood or stonework
itself has been dissolved into a pile of matter.

02:30:08.990 --> 02:30:17.913
You see places where fires have broken out and
some places have burned into a giant cluster of

02:30:17.913 --> 02:30:26.190
ash and broken wood. A quick memory glance at this
height, you start looking for specific areas that

02:30:26.190 --> 02:30:31.649
you recall from memory. One: you glance over and
see where you first came to meet Pike, where she

02:30:31.649 --> 02:30:39.731
and Wilhand lived. That area is the area of town
that was, apparently, salvaged from the battle. It

02:30:39.731 --> 02:30:45.438
still stands, there appears to be very minimal
impact. As you give yourself enough closeness to

02:30:45.438 --> 02:30:49.899
check in, the red brick homestead of Wilhand does
appear to be standing.

02:30:49.899 --> 02:30:51.742
LAURA: Can we see Wilhand anywhere?

02:30:51.742 --> 02:31:04.701
MATT: At this distance, no. You also note, towards
the shopping district of Westruun, there is the shop

02:31:04.701 --> 02:31:09.160
of Abjurist Noja, one of your first enchanter
friends who protected you during your first

02:31:09.160 --> 02:31:10.295
Winter's Crest.

02:31:10.295 --> 02:31:13.103
MARISHA: Yeah! He cast the protection spell on
us!

02:31:13.103 --> 02:31:14.793
TALIESIN: This is making me feel very old.

02:31:14.793 --> 02:31:20.864
MATT: His structure is still standing as well. A
few buildings around did not fare so well, but his

02:31:20.864 --> 02:31:29.486
shop and a number of other ones adjacent to it
seem to still be standing. You can't really tell

02:31:29.486 --> 02:31:33.500
if they're functional, or how busy they are, or if
anyone's doing anything with them, but that's still

02:31:33.500 --> 02:31:41.513
there. You do notice, though, at numerous parts of
the street, there are just piles and piles of

02:31:41.513 --> 02:31:50.768
burnt wood and ash, like they're large burn piles
that were set at different periods of time and

02:31:50.768 --> 02:31:57.516
have long since burned. Little bits of white,
post-burning plumes that still smolder over the

02:31:57.516 --> 02:32:03.067
past few days. You're not quite sure what these
piles contained at the time they were set ablaze.

02:32:03.067 --> 02:32:12.746
There is still the worship district here. You have
the various temples. Best you can glance, a few of

02:32:12.746 --> 02:32:17.883
them have been partially toppled. There is damage
to some of the buildings. Still too far away to

02:32:17.883 --> 02:32:24.307
make out any specific details beyond that, some of the
structures having taken a hit in previous

02:32:24.307 --> 02:32:26.426
conflicts. You're not sure from which source.

02:32:26.426 --> 02:32:30.222
LAURA: What about the mayor's house where we heard
Horace--?

02:32:30.222 --> 02:32:39.374
MATT: The Margrave's. Towards the southern central portion
of Westruun, south of the main town square where

02:32:39.374 --> 02:32:45.007
the bulk of your first Winter's Crest festival
here in Westruun took place. The Margrave's house

02:32:45.007 --> 02:32:50.943
is at the very southernmost portion of that. That
entire square is lined with row after row of

02:32:50.943 --> 02:32:59.429
sharpened wood sticks and various other weapons,
tridents, broken swords that have been, with

02:32:59.429 --> 02:33:06.205
ropes, strapped together to form a military
barricade. If anything were to attempt to attack

02:33:06.205 --> 02:33:12.680
from the ground, it would be difficult to do so if this
area was filled with prepared soldiers, using

02:33:12.680 --> 02:33:22.098
these as protective guard. The actual Margrave's
home is intact, although at this glance, you can

02:33:22.098 --> 02:33:30.161
see a lot of it has been defiled, elements of the
outside walls are strewn with dark burgundy paint

02:33:30.161 --> 02:33:40.287
slapped over. You can see what looks to be some
sort of strings adorning edges of it, like

02:33:40.287 --> 02:33:49.590
decoration. You see, walking through this area,
what looks to be 12 or 13 or so armed individuals

02:33:49.590 --> 02:33:55.231
of varying heights. Probably a good six or seven
goliaths among them. Others appear to be human,

02:33:55.231 --> 02:34:00.050
half-orc, it's hard to make out the full details
from this distance. They're all on the outskirts

02:34:00.050 --> 02:34:07.073
surrounding what was previously the Margrave's
home. Now the homestead of Kevdak, seemingly.

02:34:07.073 --> 02:34:09.462
LAURA: Can we see Kevdak anywhere?

02:34:09.462 --> 02:34:11.516
MATT: You have no idea what Kevdak looks like.

02:34:11.516 --> 02:34:15.389
LAURA: I look for a bigger goliath than the rest,
or one that looks older and bigger.

02:34:15.389 --> 02:34:18.353
MATT: Make a perception check.

02:34:18.353 --> 02:34:20.991
LAURA: 16.

02:34:20.991 --> 02:34:24.923
MATT: 16. At this distance, it's hard to make out
any specific details. You can barely make out the

02:34:24.923 --> 02:34:28.907
fact that they're goliath. It's only because
you've traveled with Grog so long you can pick out

02:34:28.907 --> 02:34:34.805
the details, the hairless form, the tattoos, the
general tone of skin. They're male and female,

02:34:34.805 --> 02:34:41.260
it's a smattering of all different types of
goliaths. Some of different thickness, some that

02:34:41.260 --> 02:34:46.687
are a little more barrel-chested and wide, some
that are a little shorter. There are other

02:34:46.687 --> 02:34:49.998
similarly dressed individuals that are not
goliaths as well, but they seem to be more of a

02:34:49.998 --> 02:34:54.682
subservient role within the herd than the goliaths
that would be the ruling class within this

02:34:54.682 --> 02:35:02.507
self-contained society. But no one stands out to
you as matching the descriptions of Kevdak that

02:35:02.507 --> 02:35:03.502
Grog gave you.

02:35:03.502 --> 02:35:06.296
TALIESIN: The mansion seems to be where they've
based their operations, though.

02:35:06.296 --> 02:35:07.878
MATT: Seemingly.

02:35:07.878 --> 02:35:11.631
LAURA: We don't see a cluster of prisoners
anywhere out in the open?

02:35:11.631 --> 02:35:13.878
TALIESIN: Where's the prison I was being held in?

02:35:13.878 --> 02:35:18.290
MATT: The prison you were being held in was in the
Umbra Hills. That's far north of Westruun.

02:35:18.290 --> 02:35:20.287
LIAM: That's when we fought the Nightmare.

02:35:20.287 --> 02:35:21.399
LAURA: Yeah!

02:35:21.399 --> 02:35:25.795
TALIESIN: (laughs) (imitates Laura) Yeah!

02:35:25.795 --> 02:35:28.615
LAURA: Do we see a cluster?

02:35:28.615 --> 02:35:31.107
MATT: Do you see a what?

02:35:31.107 --> 02:35:34.405
LAURA: A cluster of prisoners out in the open at
all, or is it just out around--?

02:35:34.405 --> 02:35:37.022
MATT: It's hard to tell because most everyone who
lives here is, in some, way, shape, or form a

02:35:37.022 --> 02:35:46.011
prisoner. You do see at the various gates of the city
as you went through, there's about three, four

02:35:46.011 --> 02:35:53.078
individuals average stationed there. Nobody seems
to be entering or exiting. And the pace of those

02:35:53.078 --> 02:36:00.141
that are not of the herd that you see walking
through the city has a feel of hopelessness, or

02:36:00.141 --> 02:36:06.990
at least their presence outdoors is more of
function. They do what they're told, and if

02:36:06.990 --> 02:36:10.442
they're not, you've already seen what happens to
them.

02:36:10.442 --> 02:36:14.382
MARISHA: Now what?

02:36:14.382 --> 02:36:18.973
TALIESIN: Maybe stealth isn't-- maybe Grog's
right-- we can't talk, can we?

02:36:18.973 --> 02:36:20.388
MARISHA: No, we're fucking clouds.

02:36:20.388 --> 02:36:24.368
LAURA: Can we say go back to the--

02:36:24.368 --> 02:36:26.858
LIAM: Yeah, I'm gesturing to go. Get out.

02:36:26.858 --> 02:36:28.289
LAURA: Yeah, let's go back.

02:36:28.289 --> 02:36:30.878
MATT: Make a stealth check, guys, on the way out.

02:36:30.878 --> 02:36:33.141
SAM: 93.

02:36:33.141 --> 02:36:36.715
TRAVIS: Scanlan and I have been alone.

02:36:36.715 --> 02:36:38.102
LAURA: 39.

02:36:38.102 --> 02:36:39.507
MARISHA: 32.

02:36:39.507 --> 02:36:40.648
LIAM: 44.

02:36:40.648 --> 02:36:41.982
TALIESIN: 26.

02:36:41.982 --> 02:36:48.025
MATT: Okay! You guys make your way westward. Is
there anything you guys wanted to accomplish while

02:36:48.025 --> 02:36:49.361
they were gone?

02:36:49.361 --> 02:36:51.436
SAM: Just massage each other.

02:36:51.436 --> 02:36:58.427
TRAVIS: Right, so I turn to Scanlan. And I say:
you and I are mates, right?

02:36:58.427 --> 02:37:00.590
SAM: Yes, the best of mates.

02:37:00.590 --> 02:37:06.899
TRAVIS: Right. Could I confide something in you?

02:37:06.899 --> 02:37:10.169
SAM: I wasn't aware that you knew what that word
meant.

02:37:10.169 --> 02:37:20.453
TRAVIS: (clears throat) Right. Well, I'm full of
surprises. One of which is-- so, I had this

02:37:20.453 --> 02:37:27.629
horrible dream recently, and in the dream, I was
killing all these people with this amazing sword

02:37:27.629 --> 02:37:28.858
that I have.

02:37:28.858 --> 02:37:30.096
SAM: Yes?

02:37:30.096 --> 02:37:35.820
TRAVIS: But there were a lot of people, and some
of the people that got killed I knew. And I feel

02:37:35.820 --> 02:37:45.372
it has something to do with this sword that I
have. And the secret is: I can hear the sword

02:37:45.372 --> 02:37:47.397
talking to me.

02:37:47.397 --> 02:37:50.773
SAM: Like, talking-talking, or you just--

02:37:50.773 --> 02:37:57.149
TRAVIS: Yeah, look, so I'm telling you because you
and I have such a history, right? And I feel like

02:37:57.149 --> 02:38:01.857
you won't judge me, but, like, I'm afraid the rest
of the group won't quite understand. I don't know

02:38:01.857 --> 02:38:05.941
if I'm crazy or if this sword is talking to me.

02:38:05.941 --> 02:38:08.086
SAM: Do you see a mouth on it or anything?

02:38:08.086 --> 02:38:10.692
TRAVIS: No, I just hear a voice and I was
wondering if maybe I take it out--

02:38:10.692 --> 02:38:11.878
SAM: All the time?

02:38:11.878 --> 02:38:15.450
TRAVIS: No, only when I'm holding it. So, like, I
could take it out now and we could see maybe if

02:38:15.450 --> 02:38:16.655
you hear it.

02:38:16.655 --> 02:38:17.580
SAM: Okay.

02:38:17.580 --> 02:38:19.035
TRAVIS: So I take out Craven Edge.

02:38:19.035 --> 02:38:22.182
MATT: You take out Craven Edge, you hold it out in
front of you.

02:38:22.182 --> 02:38:28.796
TRAVIS: Craven Edge. How did you enjoy your
snack?

02:38:28.796 --> 02:38:35.926
MATT: "It was a good snack. A snack it was. If
there's more where that came from,

02:38:35.926 --> 02:38:38.427
"I would be so thankful."

02:38:38.427 --> 02:38:40.281
TRAVIS: Are you getting that?!

02:38:40.281 --> 02:38:42.966
SAM: No, Grog, I'm not.

02:38:42.966 --> 02:38:47.726
TRAVIS: You're not hearing anything? No, like,
super sexy (low-pitched growl) voice? Nothing?

02:38:47.726 --> 02:38:49.527
SAM: Try one more time.

02:38:49.527 --> 02:38:59.075
TRAVIS: No, it's not worth it. Look, do you want
to hold the sword?

02:38:59.075 --> 02:39:05.124
SAM: Sure! That's a good idea, actually! Can I
hold the sword? How big is it?

02:39:05.124 --> 02:39:12.985
MATT: It's a greatsword. It's almost twice the
length of your whole body and probably weighs

02:39:12.985 --> 02:39:14.879
close to as much as you do.

02:39:14.879 --> 02:39:19.096
SAM: Can you hold the top part and I'll just hold it by
the handle, the hilty-part?

02:39:19.096 --> 02:39:21.915
TRAVIS: I hold the blade, and I hand the hilt
towards Scanlan.

02:39:21.915 --> 02:39:26.028
MATT: As you hand the hilt over towards him, there's
hesitation in the voice, "Only you are worthy of

02:39:26.028 --> 02:39:28.447
"holding me. You will hand me to no one."

02:39:28.447 --> 02:39:38.910
TRAVIS: (grunts) See, now, now, now, Craven, I'm
starting to feel like I'm doubting myself. I'm

02:39:38.910 --> 02:39:42.165
seeing things-- he's talking to me.

02:39:42.165 --> 02:39:43.300
SAM: Okay.

02:39:43.300 --> 02:39:48.984
TRAVIS: I'm going to take it right back, I just
want him to experience your glory.

02:39:48.984 --> 02:39:50.420
MATT: Make a charisma check.

02:39:50.420 --> 02:39:53.442
TRAVIS: Shit. Fuck. That's bad.

02:39:53.442 --> 02:39:54.678
LAURA: No.

02:39:54.678 --> 02:39:59.922
TRAVIS: (gulp) Seven.

02:39:59.922 --> 02:40:18.018
MATT: Seven? Okay. You can't give the sword up. It
means too much, and the voice in your head says,

02:40:18.018 --> 02:40:24.219
"Only those proven worthy to feed me can
carry me. And you, Grog--"

02:40:24.219 --> 02:40:26.456
SAM: Grog, hand me the sword.

02:40:26.456 --> 02:40:33.716
TRAVIS: (pained) No. On second thought, don't
worry about it. It's clearly-- and I take it

02:40:33.716 --> 02:40:43.038
back-- it's not, it's just-- maybe I just need to
see someone or talk to somebody. Clearly, I mean,

02:40:43.038 --> 02:40:45.785
you don't-- it's talking, you don't hear it,
right?

02:40:45.785 --> 02:40:49.672
SAM: I don't hear it, but maybe if you handed it
to me, I could.

02:40:49.672 --> 02:40:53.649
TRAVIS: No, it's really heavy, too. And I sheathe
it.

02:40:53.649 --> 02:40:55.403
SAM: Do I believe him?

02:40:55.403 --> 02:40:58.911
MATT: Make an insight check.

02:40:58.911 --> 02:40:59.954
SAM: Not good.

02:40:59.954 --> 02:41:02.041
MATT: Grog, make a deception check.

02:41:02.041 --> 02:41:05.175
SAM: Not good! Seven!

02:41:05.175 --> 02:41:06.311
TRAVIS: Three!

02:41:06.311 --> 02:41:09.307
(laughing)

02:41:09.307 --> 02:41:16.011
MATT: Grog's not the most able liar, you glean.
You're pretty good at seeing past the deceit of

02:41:16.011 --> 02:41:20.102
others. This definitely falls under the line of
deceit, as adorable as it is to see him try.

02:41:20.102 --> 02:41:28.597
SAM: Grog, you want to give me the sword. And I
will cast Suggestion on him.

02:41:28.597 --> 02:41:31.104
LAURA: Ooh!

02:41:31.104 --> 02:41:33.340
MATT: Is it a wisdom saving throw?

02:41:33.340 --> 02:41:35.858
SAM: I haven't used it in a while, and I don't
have my thing.

02:41:35.858 --> 02:41:39.070
MATT: I'll pull it up real fast, just to make
sure. I'm pretty sure it is.

02:41:39.070 --> 02:41:40.660
TALIESIN: I think it is.

02:41:40.660 --> 02:41:48.358
MATT: Yep, make a wisdom saving throw.

02:41:48.358 --> 02:41:55.086
TRAVIS: Giant modifier on this one. 16. With a
modifier of zero.

02:41:55.086 --> 02:41:56.677
SAM: Well, 18, if I'm not using my thing.

02:41:56.677 --> 02:42:00.710
MATT: Not using the cone, so no, it still fails.
So you feel compelled now to give this sword.

02:42:00.710 --> 02:42:02.665
You're like, no, that's a great idea.

02:42:02.665 --> 02:42:07.381
TRAVIS: You know what? That's a great idea! I feel
like you should hold this sword. And I hold on to the

02:42:07.381 --> 02:42:09.926
blade, but I still hand the hilt to him.

02:42:09.926 --> 02:42:19.657
MATT: As he holds up the sword towards you,
you grasp the handle. As his hand touches it, the

02:42:19.657 --> 02:42:26.473
voice goes, "No! Only you can wield me!" Go ahead
and make a wisdom saving throw again.

02:42:26.473 --> 02:42:29.428
TRAVIS: 18.

02:42:29.428 --> 02:42:31.429
MATT: I'm sorry, that's a charisma saving throw.

02:42:31.429 --> 02:42:32.671
TRAVIS: 19.

02:42:32.671 --> 02:42:34.683
MATT: 19?

02:42:34.683 --> 02:42:35.892
TRAVIS: Yeah, plus one.

02:42:35.892 --> 02:42:42.108
MATT: All right. You feel the influence of the
blade begin into creep into your mind, but the

02:42:42.108 --> 02:42:48.103
bond you have with Scanlan and the time you've
traveled together, you manage to shrug it off.

02:42:48.103 --> 02:42:57.330
Fighting that impulse, you still hand the blade
over. You take the handle. You let go of the

02:42:57.330 --> 02:43:01.392
weapon. You hold it in your hand now. It's a
(heavy thud).

02:43:01.392 --> 02:43:05.225
TALIESIN: You ruin everything good! You take
everything good away from all of us!

02:43:05.225 --> 02:43:07.563
SAM: Well, it's heavy.

02:43:07.563 --> 02:43:09.949
TALIESIN: Throw it into acid, why don't you?!

02:43:09.949 --> 02:43:11.503
TRAVIS: Ask it a question!

02:43:11.503 --> 02:43:13.389
SAM: Oh! I talk to it?

02:43:13.389 --> 02:43:17.041
TRAVIS: Yeah! And it'll talk right back, it's like
that!

02:43:17.041 --> 02:43:29.991
SAM: Oi, Craven Edge. Have you been talking to my
friend Grog?

02:43:29.991 --> 02:43:46.299
MATT: There's a long beat of silence. And then a
barely audible (annoyed sigh).

02:43:46.299 --> 02:43:49.065
LIAM: Sing to it!

02:43:49.065 --> 02:43:59.388
MATT: All of a sudden, you hear this tiny voice
creep up in the back of your head: "If you truly

02:43:59.388 --> 02:44:11.315
"wish to hold me in your grasp, I require you to
prove to me your worthiness."

02:44:11.315 --> 02:44:15.487
TRAVIS: Is it saying something?

02:44:15.487 --> 02:44:17.645
SAM: No.

02:44:17.645 --> 02:44:20.486
TRAVIS: No?! It's not saying anything?!

02:44:20.486 --> 02:44:28.128
SAM: Craven Edge? How do I prove I'm worthy?

02:44:28.128 --> 02:44:29.499
TRAVIS: What?

02:44:29.499 --> 02:44:33.872
(laughing)

02:44:33.872 --> 02:44:40.740
MATT: The blade, all of a sudden, it almost seems
to have a slight shift of its own, like a divining

02:44:40.740 --> 02:44:46.579
rod, and it moves. And the blade shifts away from
the direction of you and Grog and gently shifts

02:44:46.579 --> 02:44:53.157
down the way to an older gentleman who's now
returned to picking a few crops and it points in

02:44:53.157 --> 02:44:58.187
his direction and says, "Prove to me."

02:44:58.187 --> 02:44:59.956
LAURA: Is it Reggie?

02:44:59.956 --> 02:45:01.355
MATT: Pointing to Reginald.

02:45:01.355 --> 02:45:02.545
LAURA: No!

02:45:02.545 --> 02:45:03.758
MARISHA: Not Reggie!

02:45:03.758 --> 02:45:06.312
TRAVIS: Why are you pointing it at Reggie?

02:45:06.312 --> 02:45:17.156
SAM: I don't think I can. I don't think I want to.
So I think I'll try to give the sword back to Grog.

02:45:17.156 --> 02:45:19.225
MATT: Make a charisma check.

02:45:19.225 --> 02:45:24.587
SAM: Is this magic?

02:45:24.587 --> 02:45:35.321
MATT: It's not a spell. Let me double-check, if
you're referring to the gnomish racial capability.

02:45:35.321 --> 02:45:38.422
Let me go ahead and check the rules here, because
this could make a difference here.

02:45:38.422 --> 02:45:42.413
SAM: Well, it's fine.

02:45:42.413 --> 02:45:46.823
MATT: Against magic? I'll say yes, because it's
technically a magical entity.

02:45:46.823 --> 02:45:49.815
SAM: Natural 20.

02:45:49.815 --> 02:45:54.085
TALIESIN: Witchcraft!

02:45:54.085 --> 02:45:58.468
MATT: The sheer force of personality that begins
to exude from this weapon, you sense that it is

02:45:58.468 --> 02:46:05.234
old, it has seen many a hand, and has probably
taken far many more a life. But it's not met a

02:46:05.234 --> 02:46:08.004
gnome like you before, Scanlan Shorthalt.

02:46:08.004 --> 02:46:12.415
TALIESIN: (singing) Never known a gnome like you
before!

02:46:12.415 --> 02:46:14.555
SAM: Take this back, will you?

02:46:14.555 --> 02:46:20.608
TRAVIS: Yeah! I take it back. It talked to you,
then, yeah?

02:46:20.608 --> 02:46:22.788
SAM: Yes, it did.

02:46:22.788 --> 02:46:24.912
TRAVIS: Right, it's creepy as shit.

02:46:24.912 --> 02:46:31.077
SAM: It's very compelling. I don't know if you
should have this, Grog.

02:46:31.077 --> 02:46:35.807
TRAVIS: (confused sputtering) Now, hold on! I just
wanted to make sure that I wasn't fucking, you

02:46:35.807 --> 02:46:41.431
know, batshit crazy, which I'm not! And I'm really
glad that we're sharing in this now. But hey!

02:46:41.431 --> 02:46:51.737
Hey! Don't tell anyone. Promise me.

02:46:51.737 --> 02:46:59.013
SAM: All right. I won't tell anyone. But I might
have to ask some questions about this.

02:46:59.013 --> 02:47:02.868
TRAVIS: No, that's why I brought you in! You're
all smart, right? And I always want to ask

02:47:02.868 --> 02:47:07.149
questions like, what's the first thing it
remembers, what was it doing with Lord Briarwood--?

02:47:07.149 --> 02:47:09.177
SAM: Does it tell you to kill things?

02:47:09.177 --> 02:47:10.352
TRAVIS: No!

02:47:10.352 --> 02:47:12.747
SAM: A lot? I know it does, it just told me to
kill something.

02:47:12.747 --> 02:47:15.120
TRAVIS: You must be a dark wizard.

02:47:15.120 --> 02:47:18.153
SAM: Does it tell you to kill things?

02:47:18.153 --> 02:47:20.216
TRAVIS: No! It just says it's hungry.

02:47:20.216 --> 02:47:27.277
MATT: At which point, you both hear a voice
simultaneously go, "Always hungry."

02:47:27.277 --> 02:47:28.526
SAM: Yeah!

02:47:28.526 --> 02:47:32.996
TRAVIS: You heard it that time! Holy shit! I feel
like Kevin Costner in Field of Dreams and you're

02:47:32.996 --> 02:47:36.541
James Earl Jones! I've got a friend in this now!

02:47:36.541 --> 02:47:39.539
(laughing)

02:47:39.539 --> 02:47:43.634
TALIESIN: Oh boy.

02:47:43.634 --> 02:47:47.662
TRAVIS: Right, so, look, you know.

02:47:47.662 --> 02:47:49.998
SAM: We should not tell the others about this.
This is very strange.

02:47:49.998 --> 02:47:50.937
TRAVIS: Yeah!

02:47:50.937 --> 02:47:51.999
SAM: They might freak out.

02:47:51.999 --> 02:47:52.808
TRAVIS: Right!

02:47:52.808 --> 02:47:56.463
SAM: I'm going to ask about this. When next we see
Pike, I'll ask her about it.

02:47:56.463 --> 02:47:57.591
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:47:57.591 --> 02:48:03.553
SAM: Find out if it's good or bad or neutral.
Because I don't know anything about this. Right, I

02:48:03.553 --> 02:48:05.296
don't know anything about this?

02:48:05.296 --> 02:48:06.977
MATT: Make an arcana check.

02:48:06.977 --> 02:48:08.848
TRAVIS: It could be good; there's nothing wrong
with being hungry.

02:48:08.848 --> 02:48:10.302
SAM: 12.

02:48:10.302 --> 02:48:12.653
MATT: 12. It seems magical.

02:48:12.653 --> 02:48:17.008
SAM: Yeah, I don't know. Don't know anything about
this.

02:48:17.008 --> 02:48:24.924
MATT: As a bard, you understand that there are
certain artifacts, weapons that either upon their

02:48:24.924 --> 02:48:30.758
creation, upon their development, had the essence
of a creature or soul put into it. Or, conversely,

02:48:30.758 --> 02:48:39.903
the weapon came into being as its own personality.
You're not sure of the nature of this, and you're

02:48:39.903 --> 02:48:44.779
unable to ascertain which side of the spectrum it
lies on as far as morality goes.

02:48:44.779 --> 02:48:50.695
SAM: I'll do some investigating. In the meantime,
try not to kill anyone in our party.

02:48:50.695 --> 02:48:53.697
If it tells you to.

02:48:53.697 --> 02:48:55.273
TRAVIS: I would never!

02:48:55.273 --> 02:48:56.200
SAM: Well.

02:48:56.200 --> 02:48:57.155
TRAVIS: Never!

02:48:57.155 --> 02:48:58.034
SAM: Okay.

02:48:58.034 --> 02:48:59.894
TRAVIS: No, yeah there's never even, like--

02:48:59.894 --> 02:49:01.189
SAM: Let's just keep this between us.

02:49:01.189 --> 02:49:02.560
TRAVIS: Yeah, totes.

02:49:02.560 --> 02:49:05.641
SAM: Just like that time in Emon when we--

02:49:05.641 --> 02:49:06.593
TRAVIS: Yep!

02:49:06.593 --> 02:49:07.386
SAM: --double-teamed--

02:49:07.386 --> 02:49:10.115
TRAVIS: The Eiffel Tower!

02:49:10.115 --> 02:49:11.001
SAM: Yep!

02:49:11.001 --> 02:49:12.074
TRAVIS: Yep! All right!

02:49:12.074 --> 02:49:13.388
SAM: It was a--

02:49:13.388 --> 02:49:14.951
TALIESIN: Oh, that went up my nose!

02:49:14.951 --> 02:49:17.695
LAURA: Ugh!

02:49:17.695 --> 02:49:21.930
MATT: At which point, a few clusters of wind come
landing out of the sky.

02:49:21.930 --> 02:49:23.177
MARISHA: What? Green lights?

02:49:23.177 --> 02:49:24.084
LAURA: That's us.

02:49:24.084 --> 02:49:25.514
MATT: You guys, you're the mist!

02:49:25.514 --> 02:49:27.724
MARISHA: (panicked yelling) Oh! It's just me!

02:49:27.724 --> 02:49:30.586
TALIESIN: You're literally just scared of your
hands.

02:49:30.586 --> 02:49:32.565
MARISHA: (relieved) Oh!

02:49:32.565 --> 02:49:34.929
TRAVIS: What did--

02:49:34.929 --> 02:49:36.566
SAM: Nothing happened here. How was your trip?

02:49:36.566 --> 02:49:37.756
TRAVIS: Yeah, boring here.

02:49:37.756 --> 02:49:38.593
LAURA: Totally boring?

02:49:38.593 --> 02:49:39.777
TRAVIS: Yep. No action.

02:49:39.777 --> 02:49:44.212
LAURA: You know, not a lot to see there. There's a
lot of goliaths and a lot of other bad guys

02:49:44.212 --> 02:49:47.660
walking around, oppressing very nice-looking
people.

02:49:47.660 --> 02:49:48.875
TRAVIS: A lot of goliaths?

02:49:48.875 --> 02:49:52.573
MARISHA: They've made really poky fences
everywhere.

02:49:52.573 --> 02:49:53.887
TRAVIS: That's what I'd do.

02:49:53.887 --> 02:50:03.257
LAURA: It looks like if we barged in, straight in,
they'd probably have very good fortifications.

02:50:03.257 --> 02:50:04.470
TRAVIS: Right.

02:50:04.470 --> 02:50:06.694
MARISHA: I also think they're trying to be scary.

02:50:06.694 --> 02:50:08.917
TRAVIS: Trying to be scary?

02:50:08.917 --> 02:50:14.948
MARISHA: Not that you're not scary all the time,
Grog. I just think they're like, ooh.

02:50:14.948 --> 02:50:16.634
LAURA: They really want to look scary.

02:50:16.634 --> 02:50:18.760
MARISHA: They really want to look tough, yeah.

02:50:18.760 --> 02:50:25.237
LAURA: So, here's the thing. Do we barge in,
totally risk our lives? Or try to find a way

02:50:25.237 --> 02:50:28.689
around this situation?

02:50:28.689 --> 02:50:31.474
SAM: There's a central stronghold of some sort?

02:50:31.474 --> 02:50:32.472
TALIESIN: Yes.

02:50:32.472 --> 02:50:33.586
SAM: Is it a fortress?

02:50:33.586 --> 02:50:35.407
LAURA: It's where the mayor lived before.

02:50:35.407 --> 02:50:36.481
SAM: It's a house?

02:50:36.481 --> 02:50:37.955
LAURA: Yeah, it's like a big house.

02:50:37.955 --> 02:50:39.577
TALIESIN and MARISHA: It's a nice house.

02:50:39.577 --> 02:50:45.478
SAM: And if we were to make our way into it,
somehow, what would our mission be?

02:50:45.478 --> 02:50:52.471
LIAM: Well, let's put on the table what we're
doing here. Right? Kevdak has the Knuckles. We

02:50:52.471 --> 02:50:57.392
don't know where he is. He's probably pretty
formidable on his own. And in a day or two, a

02:50:57.392 --> 02:51:02.620
dragon is going to be swinging by, so it's not one
problem, it's a very large problem

02:51:02.620 --> 02:51:04.178
and a &lt;i&gt;massive&lt;/i&gt; problem.

02:51:04.178 --> 02:51:05.469
TRAVIS: Agreed.

02:51:05.469 --> 02:51:12.823
LAURA: I wonder if Kevdak goes to the sacrificial
area where they leave the hoard for the dragon.

02:51:12.823 --> 02:51:14.979
TALIESIN: I wouldn't.

02:51:14.979 --> 02:51:18.810
MARISHA: Or if he does rounds to check in on people.

02:51:18.810 --> 02:51:24.684
TALIESIN: I'll also say I think it's more than
likely that, in the end, I doubt the dragons would

02:51:24.684 --> 02:51:27.941
care who is filling the sacrificial plate.

02:51:27.941 --> 02:51:29.450
LAURA: As long as someone is.

02:51:29.450 --> 02:51:30.728
TALIESIN: As long as the plate's full.

02:51:30.728 --> 02:51:40.196
TRAVIS: As far as this city goes, correct me if
I'm wrong, but we have two options. Either we

02:51:40.196 --> 02:51:49.218
stealth in with the stealthy people, not me
included, and we try and pickpocket Kevdak for the

02:51:49.218 --> 02:51:56.203
Knuckles. Or I challenge Kevdak for the Knuckles.

02:51:56.203 --> 02:52:02.676
MARISHA: Is Kevdak known to ever wander off by
himself? Does he take interest in his subjects to

02:52:02.676 --> 02:52:04.338
where we could corner him alone?

02:52:04.338 --> 02:52:07.879
LAURA: Or is it a walk in and try to challenge
him?

02:52:07.879 --> 02:52:11.293
SAM: We could take out that guard, what was his
name, Cole or something?

02:52:11.293 --> 02:52:14.562
TRAVIS: Yeah, Cole was heading back to the city,
though.

02:52:14.562 --> 02:52:18.136
SAM: Well, we could find one of your goliath
friends, hold them hostage,

02:52:18.136 --> 02:52:20.251
and draw out Kevdak that way.

02:52:20.251 --> 02:52:23.539
TRAVIS: They won't care about a hostage.

02:52:23.539 --> 02:52:26.522
MARISHA: There also could be the issue of are they
going to go looking for Horace?

02:52:26.522 --> 02:52:30.865
TRAVIS: Maybe. Not that hard, though.

02:52:30.865 --> 02:52:37.177
SAM: We could do some sort of a diversion, set a
fire or something that would draw them out. Or set

02:52:37.177 --> 02:52:39.447
a fire to the house they live in.

02:52:39.447 --> 02:52:41.723
MARISHA: That's not a bad idea. What would bring
Kevdak out?

02:52:41.723 --> 02:52:43.736
TALIESIN: Grog. Grog would bring Kevdak out.

02:52:43.736 --> 02:52:44.918
MARISHA: Grog?

02:52:44.918 --> 02:52:48.211
SAM: Do you want to march in there, solo, while we
stealth--

02:52:48.211 --> 02:52:49.290
LAURA: &lt;i&gt;No!&lt;/i&gt;

02:52:49.290 --> 02:52:54.614
SAM: No, no, while we all stealth around in the
rooftops watching, ready to act.

02:52:54.614 --> 02:53:03.219
LIAM: Grog, I'm curious how tied you feel to the
ways of your people now, or if you do. Do you feel

02:53:03.219 --> 02:53:09.620
the need, yourself, to face him on your own, or
would you be amenable, would you be friendly to

02:53:09.620 --> 02:53:14.971
the idea of my sister and I softening him up for a
moment, and then letting you have at it? What do

02:53:14.971 --> 02:53:18.333
you want to do here?

02:53:18.333 --> 02:53:30.752
TRAVIS: So my fear is this: that if it's anyone
but me and him, everyone gets involved. Not just

02:53:30.752 --> 02:53:38.750
us, but all 60 of them in that stronghold. I don't
think we walk out of that very well. I'm not

02:53:38.750 --> 02:53:46.834
opposed to facing him head-on and seeing what fate
has in store for me while you free any prisoners

02:53:46.834 --> 02:53:53.093
that might be around, or ransacking his house for
any fun bits, but I think he's going to have the

02:53:53.093 --> 02:53:54.995
Knuckles on him.

02:53:54.995 --> 02:54:04.074
MARISHA: Question. Is your herd and Kevdak the
type where, if you start getting the upper hand in

02:54:04.074 --> 02:54:07.760
this fight, will the herd move to protect Kevdak?

02:54:07.760 --> 02:54:08.928
TRAVIS: No.

02:54:08.928 --> 02:54:15.114
MARISHA: So they'll honor a one-on-one fight?
They'll honor that? They won't pull a fast one and

02:54:15.114 --> 02:54:17.394
swarm in when he's on his last leg?

02:54:17.394 --> 02:54:23.937
SAM: Tell us this. If we walk in with you into
town, is that not good? Should you walk into town

02:54:23.937 --> 02:54:26.110
alone and we lurk in the shadows?

02:54:26.110 --> 02:54:31.358
MARISHA: Do you want to be on a hilltop, like
standing on a hilltop?

02:54:31.358 --> 02:54:33.363
Because we could arrange that.

02:54:33.363 --> 02:54:45.007
TRAVIS: I would need to think about it.
Regardless, I think now is not the time. Perhaps

02:54:45.007 --> 02:54:48.588
we go look for Osysa's mate.

02:54:48.588 --> 02:54:51.798
SAM: You don't want to do this now? It seems like
now or never!

02:54:51.798 --> 02:54:55.415
MARISHA: We know where Kevdak is, he doesn't seem
to be going anywhere.

02:54:55.415 --> 02:54:57.632
SAM: We may not know where he is after this.

02:54:57.632 --> 02:55:03.115
TRAVIS: He seems pretty fortified. And we don't
have Pike. And this is her hometown.

02:55:03.115 --> 02:55:06.435
MARISHA: Judging by the-- no, I didn't hear any of
that.

02:55:06.435 --> 02:55:12.178
LIAM: I want to throw something in here as well.
And I don't know what to do in this situation, I'm

02:55:12.178 --> 02:55:19.540
looking to you all for guidance. But I do know two
things. One is that I don't want you to fall,

02:55:19.540 --> 02:55:29.187
Grog. We need you. And I do not want you to fall
to Kevdak. And second: if you do fall, I'm not

02:55:29.187 --> 02:55:34.495
willing to walk away without those Knuckles, not
for me to use, but for us to use. We need those

02:55:34.495 --> 02:55:41.679
Knuckles. So if you are to fall at his hand, which
I do not want, I don't know that I can honorably

02:55:41.679 --> 02:55:43.287
walk away.

02:55:43.287 --> 02:55:48.891
TRAVIS: Well, yeah, speaking from a selfish
position, if I fall, you can really do whatever

02:55:48.891 --> 02:55:55.686
the fuck you want. I think honor is bupkis at that
point. So I don't mind what you do after that.

02:55:55.686 --> 02:55:57.497
LAURA: You're not going to fall, Grog.

02:55:57.497 --> 02:55:58.807
TRAVIS: No, no, no.

02:55:58.807 --> 02:56:02.544
LIAM: My first point, Grog, I need &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt;, we all
do.

02:56:02.544 --> 02:56:14.114
TRAVIS: That's very sweet. Uh. Emotion. I would
like it if Pike was here.

02:56:14.114 --> 02:56:15.626
TALIESIN: We know.

02:56:15.626 --> 02:56:17.624
LAURA: We wait.

02:56:17.624 --> 02:56:21.783
MARISHA: Look, could we hear Horace when he was
interrogating him?

02:56:21.783 --> 02:56:22.934
MATT: Yeah.

02:56:22.934 --> 02:56:28.886
MARISHA: Judging by the way Horace was speaking,
it sounds like they're pretty settled in for right now.

02:56:28.886 --> 02:56:32.383
TRAVIS: They're not nomadic any more.

02:56:32.383 --> 02:56:35.084
LIAM: Sitting pretty.

02:56:35.084 --> 02:56:37.365
TRAVIS: Yeah, they ain't going anywhere.

02:56:37.365 --> 02:56:47.825
MARISHA: So we know where he is now. It'll give us
a little bit more time to formulate our plan? This is

02:56:47.825 --> 02:56:52.063
your fight, Grog, we'll follow you in this one.

02:56:52.063 --> 02:56:57.792
LAURA: You want to go in there with Pike?

02:56:57.792 --> 02:56:59.000
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:56:59.000 --> 02:57:00.418
MARISHA: Let's wait for Pike.

02:57:00.418 --> 02:57:08.512
LAURA: We wait for Pike. We wait until Gilmore's
up and standing and we bring Pike here with us.

02:57:08.512 --> 02:57:15.027
MARISHA: Pike might even be an emotional trigger.

02:57:15.027 --> 02:57:17.226
LAURA: For what?

02:57:17.226 --> 02:57:19.674
MARISHA: The herd if they see her, maybe.

02:57:19.674 --> 02:57:20.997
LAURA: They never met her.

02:57:20.997 --> 02:57:23.034
MARISHA: That's true. They probably
don't give any shits.

02:57:23.034 --> 02:57:29.392
TRAVIS: Let's just do this. Let's go after Osysa's
mate. If we don't learn or find anything

02:57:29.392 --> 02:57:32.501
incredibly valuable, we're at the same place we
are now.

02:57:32.501 --> 02:57:33.928
MARISHA: Good point.

02:57:33.928 --> 02:57:35.877
TRAVIS: And then we can kick the tires.

02:57:35.877 --> 02:57:38.082
SAM: Do we still have mist possibilities?

02:57:38.082 --> 02:57:39.640
MARISHA: We do, we can float on.

02:57:39.640 --> 02:57:42.476
LAURA: Is Reginald still around?

02:57:42.476 --> 02:57:47.008
MATT: You notice that Reginald's sitting there,
clutching his full stachel.

02:57:47.008 --> 02:57:49.713
LAURA: Hi, Reggie!

02:57:49.713 --> 02:57:51.428
MATT: "Hi!"

02:57:51.428 --> 02:57:54.465
LAURA: So we're going to help you.

02:57:54.465 --> 02:57:56.816
MATT: "Right."

02:57:56.816 --> 02:57:58.719
TALIESIN: We're going to go get some
reinforcements.

02:57:58.719 --> 02:58:00.526
LAURA: You might have to wait a little while.

02:58:00.526 --> 02:58:02.634
MATT: "That's okay, but you're coming back,
right?"

02:58:02.634 --> 02:58:09.954
LAURA: We most definitely are. Spread the word
that hope is alive. We will find a way to beat this.

02:58:09.954 --> 02:58:18.774
MATT: "All right. I'll be careful. You be careful,
too. Come back as soon as you think you can, when

02:58:18.774 --> 02:58:19.920
"you're ready."

02:58:19.920 --> 02:58:21.836
LAURA: Don't tell anyone what you saw here,
though, right?

02:58:21.836 --> 02:58:25.583
MATT: "Good luck."

02:58:25.583 --> 02:58:31.302
MARISHA: If anyone asks where Horace is, what
happened to Horace?

02:58:31.302 --> 02:58:34.583
MATT: "I haven't seen him for days."

02:58:34.583 --> 02:58:36.496
LAURA: That's a good answer.

02:58:36.496 --> 02:58:44.194
MATT: Spits on the pile where his corpse is. "All
right. Hope to see you soon, then." He turns

02:58:44.194 --> 02:58:46.115
around and begins walking back.

02:58:46.115 --> 02:58:47.685
MARISHA: Reginald.

02:58:47.685 --> 02:58:54.940
MATT: You guys all take a moment, collect
yourselves, revert back to your mist form, coast

02:58:54.940 --> 02:59:00.674
out of the farmland, heading southward in the
direction of the Frostweald. And there, we're

02:59:00.674 --> 02:59:03.157
going to finish our campaign for the evening.

02:59:03.157 --> 02:59:05.036
MARISHA: Ooh, shit!

02:59:05.036 --> 02:59:06.190
LAURA: Man, Grog!

02:59:06.190 --> 02:59:08.935
MARISHA: Grog!

02:59:08.935 --> 02:59:11.771
TALIESIN: Feeling the pressure now? Feel it?

02:59:11.771 --> 02:59:14.058
LIAM: Grog showing restraint and caution!

02:59:14.058 --> 02:59:16.213
LAURA: I like it! I want Pike here, too.

02:59:16.213 --> 02:59:17.672
LIAM: Yeah, so do I.

02:59:17.672 --> 02:59:19.598
TRAVIS: It's too big for Grog.

02:59:19.598 --> 02:59:22.700
SAM: Could have taken them.

02:59:22.700 --> 02:59:24.396
LAURA: You could totally have taken them.

02:59:24.396 --> 02:59:28.020
TRAVIS: Could have. But it's where Pike and her
family raised Grog.

02:59:28.020 --> 02:59:29.936
LAURA: Seems appropriate.

02:59:29.936 --> 02:59:33.482
TRAVIS: Her schedule's so busy, but if we can
get her next week...

02:59:33.482 --> 02:59:38.190
TALIESIN: Well, next week we do the sphinx, and
then the week after.

02:59:38.190 --> 02:59:42.444
MATT: We'll figure it out. We'll get her back
sometime soon, right?

02:59:42.444 --> 02:59:44.014
TRAVIS: We do.

02:59:44.014 --> 02:59:46.686
LIAM: If it takes 17 episodes, we will.

02:59:46.686 --> 02:59:50.859
MARISHA: You're in New York. Can you stuff her in
your suitcase while you're there, bring her back?

02:59:50.859 --> 02:59:52.099
LAURA: Good call!

02:59:52.099 --> 02:59:53.874
MARISHA: Just commandeer her, she's tiny!

02:59:53.874 --> 02:59:55.138
LAURA: She's little!

02:59:55.138 --> 02:59:57.477
MARISHA: She might be a little loud.

02:59:57.477 --> 03:00:00.110
LIAM: Skype is rough, guys, it makes me feel bad
for Pike.

03:00:00.110 --> 03:00:03.310
MATT: We'll have you back soon, buddy.

03:00:03.310 --> 03:00:05.018
LIAM: I'm fine.

03:00:05.018 --> 03:00:07.145
MATT: No, you're not! You need to be here!

03:00:07.145 --> 03:00:09.333
LIAM: (fake crying)

03:00:09.333 --> 03:00:16.175
MATT: I know. Hopefully we'll be having Ashley
back when Blindspot releases her between seasons,

03:00:16.175 --> 03:00:17.706
we'll have her back for a few months.

03:00:17.706 --> 03:00:18.919
MARISHA: Season break!

03:00:18.919 --> 03:00:26.307
MATT: Whenever that happens soon. We'll see you
guys back here next week for the next length of

03:00:26.307 --> 03:00:33.853
the journey of Vox Machina. Until then, is it
Thursday yet? See you guys soon.
