00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.957
MATT: Good evening, everyone! And welcome to our
eleventh episode of Critical Role. I think our

00:00:04.957 --> 00:00:09.557
story is definitely brewing towards a coming
conclusion, whether this week or some point soon.

00:00:09.557 --> 00:00:13.870
We'll see how the story pans out. Nevertheless,
the excitement's definitely growing for Vox

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:18.620
Machina. We're currently waiting for a couple of
the party members to arrive here. But they'll be

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:23.271
here very shortly. But in the meantime, let's go
ahead and jump to our intro, and we'll come back

00:00:23.271 --> 00:00:27.216
and have a few announcements before we hop into
this week's episode and see where the story goes.

00:00:27.216 --> 00:00:29.482
See you in just a minute.

00:00:29.940 --> 00:01:34.319
[dramatic music]

00:01:36.364 --> 00:01:41.609
MATT: Hello everyone! Welcome back! (laughs)
Today's been a chaotic, end-of-the-week

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:43.217
bit of insanity.

00:01:43.217 --> 00:01:45.791
ZAC: They can't see everyone running to get the
donuts.

00:01:45.791 --> 00:01:48.554
MATT: Yeah, they can't see you guys running to get
your donuts, so it's fine. Our party was just

00:01:48.554 --> 00:01:50.220
scattering to the four winds.

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.958
MARISHA: Oh, is the visual still on Matt?

00:01:51.958 --> 00:01:53.262
MATT: It's on me. It's fine, guys.

00:01:53.262 --> 00:01:54.248
MARISHA: Aww, damn it!

00:01:54.248 --> 00:01:59.175
MATT: That's all right. So, anyway, guys. Welcome
back. We have a few announcements. First off,

00:01:59.175 --> 00:02:05.515
thank you once again, chat, for giving me this
awesome, awesome DM's cloak. We'll see at which

00:02:05.515 --> 00:02:08.262
point in the evening it becomes perfunctory. Also,
apparently we had a load of other

00:02:08.262 --> 00:02:10.052
gifts that arrived.

00:02:10.052 --> 00:02:15.040
ZAC: Yeah, yeah. Let's come over to this, so-- The
chatroom knew you guys had a big battle today,

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:21.634
possibly. So they wanted to help you guys out. So,
Marisha.

00:02:21.634 --> 00:02:25.040
(cheering)

00:02:25.281 --> 00:02:26.295
MATT: That's great!

00:02:26.295 --> 00:02:27.276
MARISHA: Yes!

00:02:27.276 --> 00:02:29.366
ZAC: And this is for you, Ashley.

00:02:29.366 --> 00:02:32.947
ASHLEY: What? A mace? Yes!

00:02:32.947 --> 00:02:37.024
ZAC: I'm not sure who the elf ears are for, that's
probably one of you guys. Actually, you know what?

00:02:37.024 --> 00:02:40.379
I think these are for-- We have the bear, Trinket,
and the ears.

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:43.036
LAURA: Oh, goodness gracious!

00:02:43.036 --> 00:02:44.626
MARISHA: You got a Trinket?

00:02:44.626 --> 00:02:46.416
ZAC: I'll let you open that--

00:02:46.416 --> 00:02:49.556
LAURA: Oh my god you guys, he's a puppet!

00:02:49.556 --> 00:02:52.312
MARISHA: Oh my god! Shut. Up.

00:02:52.312 --> 00:02:54.642
ZAC: I'm not sure what that's for--

00:02:54.642 --> 00:03:03.033
MATT: This has to be for the dragonborn. I think,
Orion, that this is a skull of a dragonborn. To

00:03:03.033 --> 00:03:06.006
put your material components in. Open it up.

00:03:06.006 --> 00:03:08.145
ORION: Oh shit!

00:03:08.145 --> 00:03:09.648
MARISHA: That's so cool!

00:03:09.648 --> 00:03:13.715
ZAC: I'm pretty sure we have a thing-- a gun on
the way, or something? Someone messaged us.

00:03:13.715 --> 00:03:15.243
I'm like--

00:03:15.243 --> 00:03:16.751
MATT: (laughs) They just ship him a glock.

00:03:16.751 --> 00:03:18.919
(laughter)

00:03:18.919 --> 00:03:20.904
ASHLEY: Who provided these?

00:03:20.904 --> 00:03:24.661
ZAC: I'll have to look that up. We had so much
stuff. I'll look it up.

00:03:24.661 --> 00:03:26.361
MATT: Please look it up. We want to thank you
before the end of the show.

00:03:26.361 --> 00:03:30.358
ZAC: This is for Scanlan, he's on his way. And
then we have-- Oh, we have the little mouse here.

00:03:30.358 --> 00:03:32.382
TALIESIN: Yeah, I gotta see that flute, though.

00:03:32.382 --> 00:03:36.553
ZAC: I believe this is for Grog. If I'm getting
any of these wrong, the chatroom will yell at me

00:03:36.553 --> 00:03:37.632
and we'll figure it out.

00:03:37.632 --> 00:03:38.754
MATT: Yeah, please figure it out.

00:03:38.754 --> 00:03:40.345
ZAC: But obviously we know who this is for.

00:03:40.345 --> 00:03:41.805
MATT: Yeah, we'll pass that over to his side,
there.

00:03:41.805 --> 00:03:47.573
ZAC: The only other announcement I have, guys,
thank you all so much for helping us reach the

00:03:47.573 --> 00:03:48.548
shirt goal.

00:03:48.548 --> 00:03:49.535
MATT: Yes, thank you so much.

00:03:49.535 --> 00:03:50.528
ASHLEY: Yes, thank you!

00:03:50.528 --> 00:03:53.631
ZAC: You have a couple more hours to get the
shirts if you don't have them yet. But we're not

00:03:53.631 --> 00:03:57.198
going to push it on you guys, we already reached
the goal. So thank you all so much. But if you

00:03:57.198 --> 00:04:02.288
still want one, I think you have, like, four more
hours and then they're gone and that shirt is no

00:04:02.288 --> 00:04:03.398
longer available.

00:04:03.398 --> 00:04:04.731
MATT: It's done after this.

00:04:04.731 --> 00:04:05.742
ZAC: Done!

00:04:05.742 --> 00:04:08.515
ORION: It's this, but gray.

00:04:08.515 --> 00:04:14.359
ZAC: Ryan, can you hand me those pictures that I
had sitting there? Where'd those go? Our giveaway

00:04:14.359 --> 00:04:22.640
tonight is when we get to 2,950 subs, we're going
to give away a 5th Edition Player's Handbook,

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:30.030
signed. As well as a signed photo of the Critical
Role crew, here. So every 50 subs we'll give away

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:35.267
this with a 5th Edition signed Player's Handbook.
And that's pretty much it. That's all I got.

00:04:35.267 --> 00:04:36.159
MATT: Yeah.

00:04:36.159 --> 00:04:38.135
ZAC: Good luck! I hope you guys die.

00:04:38.135 --> 00:04:39.820
ASHLEY: No! Get outta here!

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:45.868
MATT: Oh, there we go! And also, for Percy--

00:04:45.868 --> 00:04:47.300
MARISHA: Yes!

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:54.906
MATT: (laughs) For Percy, you get your own.
Plastic on there. Pass that on over.

00:04:54.906 --> 00:04:56.253
TALIESIN: No one is safe.

00:04:56.253 --> 00:04:57.783
MATT: Oh, that's amazing.

00:04:57.783 --> 00:04:59.713
ORION: Thank you so much. Who's the name of the
guy?

00:04:59.713 --> 00:05:04.686
MATT: We're finding out. We'll definitely thank
you before the end of today. Also, want to give a

00:05:04.686 --> 00:05:09.084
thanks out to John Dodson, who is the first to
create and send off--

00:05:09.084 --> 00:05:10.208
ORION: Our magic carpet?

00:05:10.208 --> 00:05:11.598
MATT: Our magic carpet for the party to use.

00:05:11.598 --> 00:05:12.907
(cheering)

00:05:12.907 --> 00:05:14.506
LAURA: Oh, and it's up on a thing!

00:05:14.506 --> 00:05:17.210
MATT: Yep. I understand we're going to have quite
a few magic carpets coming in. So we're probably

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:20.255
going to be swapping out as it's used, as the game
progresses.

00:05:20.255 --> 00:05:22.280
MARISHA: It's going to be, "The Magic Carpet of A
Different Color".

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:26.747
MATT: Exactly! So it's going to be "The Amazing
Technicolor Magic Carpet."

00:05:26.747 --> 00:05:29.498
LAURA: Matt, who sent these to us for our
birthday?

00:05:29.498 --> 00:05:31.672
ORION: Matt Aberny, I believe?

00:05:31.672 --> 00:05:33.441
MATT: That's awesome.

00:05:33.441 --> 00:05:38.136
ORION: Yes, Aberny. If we're saying your name
wrong, I will say it right next week. I'm sorry.

00:05:38.136 --> 00:05:39.615
But you're awesome.

00:05:39.615 --> 00:05:42.227
MATT: Matt Abernathy, I think it is.

00:05:42.227 --> 00:05:43.261
LAURA and ORION: Abernathy?

00:05:43.261 --> 00:05:46.524
MATT: I think. If we're butchering it, I
apologize, but we love you.

00:05:46.524 --> 00:05:48.329
ORION: You know who you are. Thank you. They're
awesome.

00:05:48.329 --> 00:05:56.267
MARISHA: Also, I had one of the first run of these
Critical Role shirts returned to me. I'm not sure

00:05:56.267 --> 00:06:01.342
who, someone from Canada. So if you could e-mail
me and give me your right address.

00:06:01.342 --> 00:06:04.448
MATT: Yeah, we'll research that and figure out who
it was. We'll get it to you.

00:06:04.448 --> 00:06:06.886
MARISHA: I'm not sure who it was. But I had one
returned.

00:06:06.886 --> 00:06:09.796
MATT: Yeah, if you're from Canada and you haven't
received your shirt yet, go ahead and email one of

00:06:09.796 --> 00:06:14.524
us and we'll figure out if it's you or not. So,
we'll get it to you one way or another. A couple

00:06:14.524 --> 00:06:19.162
other quick announcements for you folks. Let's
see. First off, I just want to remind everyone

00:06:19.162 --> 00:06:24.562
that our intro music, for our wonderful intro you
just saw, written by the amazing Jason Charles

00:06:24.562 --> 00:06:29.122
Miller, is on iTunes. So if you want that as a
ringtone, or just to have the music, you're

00:06:29.122 --> 00:06:32.057
welcome to go ahead and find it on iTunes,
download it. It all goes to him because he's

00:06:32.057 --> 00:06:33.781
amazing and he did it for us for free.

00:06:33.781 --> 00:06:35.283
ORION: Yeah, and it rocks.

00:06:35.283 --> 00:06:40.554
MATT: It's a great song. It gets me pumped. Also,
other questions come up recently asking what our

00:06:40.554 --> 00:06:44.918
soundtracks are for the show, that I play for
situations. The music that I run for the show for

00:06:44.918 --> 00:06:46.048
background and situations--

00:06:46.048 --> 00:06:48.388
LAURA: Zac! Travis is outside.

00:06:48.388 --> 00:06:51.572
MATT: Go let Travis in. We have a Grog arriving.
And Scanlan shortly.

00:06:51.572 --> 00:06:52.953
LIAM: Scanlan's in traffic.

00:06:52.953 --> 00:06:56.664
MATT: Yeah, but he'll be here soon. The
soundtracks used for the game generally stem from

00:06:56.664 --> 00:07:04.221
a website called Incompetech by Kevin MacLeod, who
writes great, royalty-free music. He's given us

00:07:04.221 --> 00:07:10.339
permission to use it. As well as Plate Mail Games,
which does great soundtrack and atmospheric music

00:07:10.339 --> 00:07:16.342
for RPGs. And Midnight Syndicate, also amazing,
amazing songs. They've all been amazing. So if you

00:07:16.342 --> 00:07:21.271
guys are looking for stuff for your own games,
those are where I find mine. Also, I wanted to

00:07:21.271 --> 00:07:26.205
give a big thanks to our wonderful artist, Kit
Buss, who's done all the character art.

00:07:26.205 --> 00:07:28.215
ORION: Kit, we love you.

00:07:28.215 --> 00:07:29.248
MARISHA: Kit's awesome.

00:07:29.248 --> 00:07:30.049
ASHLEY: Love you.

00:07:30.049 --> 00:07:31.310
ORION: She's so good.

00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:33.785
MATT: She's been incredible and is progressing to
do more work for us down the road of little

00:07:33.785 --> 00:07:36.465
moments throughout the game that we'll be able to
find ways to show you guys, and it's just

00:07:36.465 --> 00:07:42.491
incredible stuff. So Kit, thank you so much.
You're amazing. And we'll have more to come. Last,

00:07:42.491 --> 00:07:45.914
but not least, 826LA, our charity. Marisha, do you
want to--

00:07:45.914 --> 00:07:55.384
MARISHA: Yes. 826LA is an after-school tutoring
program and they feature in creative writing, and

00:07:55.384 --> 00:08:00.347
storytelling, and they have a Young Authors'
program, which is super amazing. And they also

00:08:00.347 --> 00:08:06.080
tend to have really cool storefronts. There's one
here, locally, in Los Angeles, one in Echo Park,

00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:12.103
and one in Mar Vista. But there tend to be 826s in
major cities all across the country. So you should

00:08:12.103 --> 00:08:17.643
check it out, and go to their storefronts and
tutor the kids and get involved. They're a really

00:08:17.643 --> 00:08:19.276
good program.

00:08:19.276 --> 00:08:29.130
MATT: So, thank you so much, Marisha. Guys, check
that out. Grog, the chatroom bought you another

00:08:29.130 --> 00:08:33.249
chalice to drink. You now have many things to
drink your grog from.

00:08:33.249 --> 00:08:35.195
LAURA: Ooh, that's some fancy grog happening.

00:08:35.195 --> 00:08:36.345
MATT: That's a fancy cup!

00:08:36.345 --> 00:08:37.228
TRAVIS: Woohoo!

00:08:37.228 --> 00:08:38.409
MARISHA: We all got things.

00:08:38.409 --> 00:08:39.568
LAURA: We all got presents, Grog!

00:08:39.568 --> 00:08:40.627
TRAVIS: Oh my god.

00:08:40.627 --> 00:08:41.756
ORION: Grog!

00:08:41.756 --> 00:08:45.411
TRAVIS: You got a gun, you got a staff, You've
got-- Is that a skull of your, like,

00:08:45.411 --> 00:08:46.683
younger brother?

00:08:46.683 --> 00:08:48.562
ORION: It's of my ancestor.

00:08:48.562 --> 00:08:49.858
ASHLEY: Oh, is that a dice holder?

00:08:49.858 --> 00:08:52.679
TRAVIS: Oh, nice! That's not dark, at all.
(mutters) What the fuck?

00:08:52.679 --> 00:08:54.234
(laughter)

00:08:54.234 --> 00:08:57.677
TRAVIS: Dagger, bear, mace! I need to put
something in this.

00:08:57.677 --> 00:09:03.722
MATT: A couple other things before we start the
game. Thank you for your patience, guys. We have

00:09:03.722 --> 00:09:08.431
one present here from a Joe Alfano. Whatever it
is, I haven't opened it up yet. We'll see what

00:09:08.431 --> 00:09:09.665
this is here shortly.

00:09:09.665 --> 00:09:11.729
MARISHA: Ooh! Seekwet pwesent!

00:09:11.729 --> 00:09:14.585
MATT: We'll find out. A present, a letter, or
something really cool.

00:09:14.585 --> 00:09:18.352
ZAC: We're only six subs away from our first
giveaway.

00:09:18.352 --> 00:09:19.208
LAURA: Oh, wow!

00:09:19.208 --> 00:09:24.191
MATT: Oh, snap! "Matt, a three-by-two flying
carpet, sized for six medium-sized figures,

00:09:24.191 --> 00:09:27.144
"depending on your bases. There may be some
overhangs. This is one of two, the embroidery

00:09:27.144 --> 00:09:28.445
"takes some time."

00:09:28.445 --> 00:09:29.983
LAURA: Another one?

00:09:29.983 --> 00:09:32.964
MATT: "The first time, if not every time, Scanlan
rides the carpet with someone else, especially

00:09:32.964 --> 00:09:38.424
"with Pike, he has to sing 'A Whole New World' from
Aladdin. Enjoy, Zombie Joe." That's amazing.

00:09:38.424 --> 00:09:41.431
(cheering)

00:09:41.431 --> 00:09:42.640
MATT: So we now have--

00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:43.962
LAURA: A new carpet!

00:09:43.962 --> 00:09:47.359
MATT: Two carpets. A layered, Amazing Technicolor
Magic Carpet.

00:09:47.359 --> 00:09:48.419
MARISHA: Woo!

00:09:48.419 --> 00:09:53.783
MATT: Thank you so much, Zombie Joe. And then we
have a great letter that is-- I'll probably read

00:09:53.783 --> 00:09:58.648
it at the end of the show today from Useless
Rogue, or Scott Ropner. So we're going to jump in

00:09:58.648 --> 00:10:02.049
the game and this is an amazing letter I'm going
to go ahead and read later on when we have a

00:10:02.049 --> 00:10:06.790
little more time. So we'll get to that shortly.
All right, so I think that gets us up to speed on

00:10:06.790 --> 00:10:13.040
everything we're trying to get you guys up to
speed on before the show. So, welcome to Critical

00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:18.821
Role. To give you guys a little backstory as to
where we are, for those who are tuning in for the

00:10:18.821 --> 00:10:23.869
first time, oh, you are tuning in to an
interesting time. This party of adventurers were

00:10:23.869 --> 00:10:32.009
tasked to locate an individual, a famed folk hero,
a paladin of Bahamut named Lady Kima of Vord, who,

00:10:32.009 --> 00:10:37.192
on a vision quest, went to search out and destroy
a great evil that was germinating beneath the

00:10:37.192 --> 00:10:42.182
dwarven city of Kraghammer in the Cliffkeep
Mountains. The party, upon delving beneath the

00:10:42.182 --> 00:10:47.892
city, discovered it breached into the Underdark,
and, following her trail, fought past duergar,

00:10:47.892 --> 00:10:54.741
ashy-skinned evil dwarves, past mind flayers and
various other terrifying denizens of the

00:10:54.741 --> 00:10:59.861
Underdark, eventually saving Lady Kima after weeks
of her own torture, and discovering that some

00:10:59.861 --> 00:11:07.769
great evil named K'Varn had unified these normal
enemy races, the duergar and the mind flayers, the

00:11:07.769 --> 00:11:16.529
illithid. Also finding that apparently, this
individual-- Yes, sir?

00:11:16.529 --> 00:11:20.282
ZAC: We should probably just go ahead and do the
giveaway, 'cause we already got to six.

00:11:20.282 --> 00:11:24.426
MATT: Oh! Well, snap! Let me finish explaining
this and we'll do the giveaway. They discovered

00:11:24.426 --> 00:11:27.647
this entity called K'Varn, this great and powerful
entity, which, apparently, had acquired an

00:11:27.647 --> 00:11:33.750
artifact known as the Horn of Orcus, that adorns
its head that gives it some sort of power imbued

00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:39.778
by the dark god of undeath, Orcus himself. The
party then managed to find its way into a cavern

00:11:39.778 --> 00:11:45.610
where the illithid city, Yug'Voril, exists. And
after a Scry spell via Keyleth last episode,

00:11:45.610 --> 00:11:52.413
unveiled this entity K'Varn to be a dastardly
beholder, an extremely dangerous aberration that

00:11:52.413 --> 00:11:58.249
currently holds, at the top of the temple in the
city, a stranglehold on the mind flayer

00:11:58.249 --> 00:12:04.134
civilization. So, that was where we left off, the
party slowly encroaching the edge of this island.

00:12:04.134 --> 00:12:08.908
And we'll start in a moment once you give the
giveaway.

00:12:08.908 --> 00:12:11.842
ZAC: All you gotta do is let them know to be
active in the chatroom, and that makes them a part

00:12:11.842 --> 00:12:12.862
of the giveaway.

00:12:12.862 --> 00:12:15.383
MATT: All right, guys, so be active in the
chatroom, that will enter you as part of the

00:12:15.383 --> 00:12:19.318
giveaway. We've already hit that, so the giveaway
should be happening very soon. So, say "hello",

00:12:19.318 --> 00:12:21.543
say your opinion, be around, and have fun.

00:12:21.543 --> 00:12:22.870
LAURA: Say, "Vex is awesome."

00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:23.907
MATT: That's right.

00:12:23.907 --> 00:12:25.129
LAURA: Say you love Trinket.

00:12:25.129 --> 00:12:29.235
MATT: Well, so, it's a shame Scanlan is not here
at the moment, since--

00:12:29.235 --> 00:12:30.907
LIAM: He's stuck, he's really stuck.

00:12:30.907 --> 00:12:32.079
MARISHA: He's stuck on the 5.

00:12:32.079 --> 00:12:33.715
TRAVIS: What's the fleshy thing in front of you?

00:12:33.715 --> 00:12:34.671
LAURA: That's ears.

00:12:34.671 --> 00:12:36.006
LIAM: These are dried apricots.

00:12:36.006 --> 00:12:37.194
TRAVIS: Those are huge!

00:12:37.194 --> 00:12:41.706
MATT: I'm just saying it's a shame, because he's
right in the thick of this sequence here. So, as

00:12:41.706 --> 00:12:46.893
the party was making their way up the shore, they
found bits of the ruins that coat the entirety of

00:12:46.893 --> 00:12:50.997
the subterranean city. They found what looked like
some sort of a large stone, partially crumbled

00:12:50.997 --> 00:12:56.592
fighting pit. And what looked-- As Vex, Vax, and
Scanlan were stealthing over, Scanlan himself

00:12:56.592 --> 00:13:04.119
invisible, had stealthed over to scout ahead,
managed to find what looked like an encampment of

00:13:04.119 --> 00:13:13.532
some kind. A series of rags and furs. A very large
living space for some sort of creature. Scanlan,

00:13:13.532 --> 00:13:19.085
failing his stealth roll, seemed to draw the
attention of whatever entity lived there, which

00:13:19.085 --> 00:13:27.849
was an extremely tall, large, giant-like creature,
malformed, kind of pale purplish-gray skin, one

00:13:27.849 --> 00:13:32.319
squinty eye and one bulging, yellowish one, that
was dragging something fleshy and bloody behind

00:13:32.319 --> 00:13:39.510
it. It turned towards the rest of the party, going
to inspect what, seemingly, created the sound near

00:13:39.510 --> 00:13:42.423
its homestead. And that is where we left off.

00:13:42.423 --> 00:13:44.695
LIAM: What's the landscape, topography,
everything?

00:13:44.695 --> 00:13:49.098
MATT: Right now, you're on the outskirts of the
fungal forest that covers large portions of this

00:13:49.098 --> 00:13:55.106
island. Where you are right now is on the edge of
this stony pit that's dug into the ground. It's

00:13:55.106 --> 00:14:00.265
about a 15-foot drop down into this pit, where the
remnants of this encampment was, and the leftover

00:14:00.265 --> 00:14:03.614
large fire pit that's just slowly burning ember
coals.

00:14:03.614 --> 00:14:05.324
LAURA: And Scanlan is still invisible?

00:14:05.324 --> 00:14:07.130
MATT: Scanlan is still invisible next to you
guys.

00:14:07.130 --> 00:14:10.636
TALIESIN: Scanlan also just texted to say, "Don't
kill the giant, don't kill the giant!"

00:14:10.636 --> 00:14:11.941
LAURA: Right, okay.

00:14:11.941 --> 00:14:14.184
TALIESIN: Texted while driving, I might add. Don't
do that.

00:14:14.184 --> 00:14:15.287
MATT: Don't do that.

00:14:15.287 --> 00:14:16.635
TRAVIS: He wants a sex puppet.

00:14:16.635 --> 00:14:20.191
LAURA: Maybe Scanlan can just stay perfectly
still, and you and I can just hide

00:14:20.191 --> 00:14:21.599
so that Scanlan can--

00:14:21.599 --> 00:14:24.775
LIAM: That's true, were there-- You said there
were buildings around?

00:14:24.775 --> 00:14:30.351
MATT: There are chunks of ruined buildings in the
vicinity, probably a good 30, 40 feet from where

00:14:30.351 --> 00:14:32.278
you are. You guys are right along the edge.

00:14:32.278 --> 00:14:39.026
LAURA: I think we should duck and hide under his
covers. His big, nasty fur bed.

00:14:39.026 --> 00:14:40.174
LIAM: All right.

00:14:40.174 --> 00:14:41.358
MATT: (booming footsteps)

00:14:41.358 --> 00:14:42.500
LAURA: I go!

00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:43.493
LIAM: Okay, stealthing away.

00:14:43.493 --> 00:14:46.953
MATT: Okay, so the two of you leap off the edge of
this, down into his living, bedding area.

00:14:46.953 --> 00:14:48.717
LAURA: Should I grab Scanlan and pull him in?

00:14:48.717 --> 00:14:50.094
LIAM: No.

00:14:50.094 --> 00:14:55.355
MATT: The two of you leap off, down. Both make an
acrobatics check.

00:14:55.355 --> 00:14:56.584
LAURA: Ugh.

00:14:56.584 --> 00:14:59.484
TRAVIS: Come on, guys.

00:14:59.484 --> 00:15:10.963
LAURA: Oh, god! Oh, it's the Underdark! Ugh! I'm
switching dice. Okay, that's much better.

00:15:10.963 --> 00:15:14.623
MATT: Favored terrain makes a ranger very happy.

00:15:14.623 --> 00:15:16.007
LAURA: That was horrifying.

00:15:16.007 --> 00:15:17.634
TRAVIS: She has so many dice now, it's ridiculous

00:15:17.634 --> 00:15:18.989
LAURA: That's a 22.

00:15:18.989 --> 00:15:19.949
MARISHA: Underdark.

00:15:19.949 --> 00:15:21.137
MATT: 22?

00:15:21.137 --> 00:15:21.968
LIAM: 20.

00:15:21.968 --> 00:15:25.353
MATT: 20 and 22. All right. The two of you leap
off-- The 15-foot fall is easy to tumble through

00:15:25.353 --> 00:15:30.412
and both of you land right next to this large pile
of rags and furs. You both quickly dive inside.

00:15:30.412 --> 00:15:31.472
LAURA: This is stupid.

00:15:31.472 --> 00:15:38.338
MATT: Which, the instinct of survival prevents you
from immediately realizing the terrible, terrible

00:15:38.338 --> 00:15:45.579
scent of long-festering body odor, what smells
like a combination of dried blood and some sort of

00:15:45.579 --> 00:15:51.051
excrement, as well as whatever entities once wore
these furs or adorned them on their fleshy self.

00:15:51.051 --> 00:15:55.934
There are still chunks and pieces of them, dried
and/or still rotting within this pile.

00:15:55.934 --> 00:15:58.186
LIAM: (retches)

00:15:58.186 --> 00:16:01.997
MATT: So, both of you sit there for a second,
diving underneath, keeping as quiet as possible.

00:16:01.997 --> 00:16:04.695
Scanlan is going to attempt to make a stealth
check.

00:16:04.695 --> 00:16:06.190
TRAVIS: Come on, buddy.

00:16:06.190 --> 00:16:07.054
MATT: All right.

00:16:07.054 --> 00:16:08.240
LAURA: Oh no.

00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:10.809
MATT AND ASHLEY: All right.

00:16:10.809 --> 00:16:18.140
MATT: As this giant, humanoid beast starts
lumbering forward, and you can just barely catch a

00:16:18.140 --> 00:16:21.862
glimpse at him because you guys are hiding from
behind. You can see giant, saggy, fleshy ears,

00:16:21.862 --> 00:16:27.394
this kind of bulbous nose. It looks almost like
tumors all across his shoulders and back. And his

00:16:27.394 --> 00:16:32.241
teeth are kind of broken and nasty, there's this
black in the gums. It just kind of steps and looks

00:16:32.241 --> 00:16:46.334
over the edge (sniffs and grunts). Licks his teeth
for a moment. Looks over. Takes a couple steps

00:16:46.334 --> 00:16:54.283
around the edge. Glances over towards the edge of
the forest. Both of you make a

00:16:54.283 --> 00:16:56.527
constitution saving throw.

00:16:56.527 --> 00:16:57.608
TRAVIS: Constitution?

00:16:57.608 --> 00:16:58.911
LAURA: Against his nasty-ass scent?

00:16:58.911 --> 00:17:01.871
MATT: As the smell, itself, it is a terrifying,
awful smell.

00:17:01.871 --> 00:17:05.365
TRAVIS: Or amazing, depending on who you are.

00:17:05.365 --> 00:17:07.131
MATT: A natural one. Top of the game.

00:17:07.131 --> 00:17:08.192
LAURA: Oh no!

00:17:08.192 --> 00:17:09.199
TALIESIN: Get it out now.

00:17:09.199 --> 00:17:13.014
MATT: Natural one gets no bonus. That is an
automatic fail.

00:17:13.014 --> 00:17:16.766
LIAM: I should have rolled the one made out of
meteorite, but I used the jade one.

00:17:16.766 --> 00:17:17.671
LAURA: Why?

00:17:17.671 --> 00:17:18.780
LIAM: And it all went wrong.

00:17:18.780 --> 00:17:20.465
MATT: What kind of a choice is that?

00:17:20.465 --> 00:17:22.543
TRAVIS: Fucked up, yeah. Meteorite wins
everything.

00:17:22.543 --> 00:17:24.235
ORION: Different energies, man!

00:17:24.235 --> 00:17:25.357
MATT: True.

00:17:25.357 --> 00:17:29.340
TALIESIN: If Scanlan were here, he'd say, "We need
to capture the giant," by the way.

00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:30.574
ASHLEY: He would, he would.

00:17:30.574 --> 00:17:31.994
LAURA: Okay, 18.

00:17:31.994 --> 00:17:35.096
LIAM: And I'm saying (retches).

00:17:35.096 --> 00:17:36.771
LAURA: Shh! Shh! Shut up!

00:17:36.771 --> 00:17:41.701
MATT: So Vex, as you reach over, you notice you
put your hand up to shut him up, but an

00:17:41.701 --> 00:17:48.747
unfamiliar, liquidy warm sensation hits your hand
as you catch him mid-vomit stream.

00:17:48.747 --> 00:17:50.639
(laughter)

00:17:50.639 --> 00:17:51.748
ASHLEY: Oh, what?

00:17:51.748 --> 00:17:53.026
MATT: You manage to muffle some of the sound.

00:17:53.026 --> 00:17:54.257
TRAVIS: You chunked!

00:17:54.257 --> 00:17:56.268
ASHLEY: That's disgusting!

00:17:56.268 --> 00:17:58.085
MATT: This is really disgusting. I'm sorry, guys.

00:17:58.085 --> 00:18:03.746
LIAM: Good plan (vomiting noise).

00:18:03.746 --> 00:18:13.550
MATT: All right. The creature suddenly whips its
head over towards the pile of rags and goes

00:18:13.550 --> 00:18:24.175
(grunts and sniffs). "What's that smell?" Grabs
the edge and leaps off. The impact of its weight

00:18:24.175 --> 00:18:29.521
no more than ten feet from you. You feel, even
through the softness, it is still soft through the

00:18:29.521 --> 00:18:33.792
nastiness, you feel the impact of both of its
giant, thick, tree-like legs slam into the stone

00:18:33.792 --> 00:18:35.359
right around you.

00:18:35.359 --> 00:18:39.497
LAURA: Make some noise!

00:18:39.497 --> 00:18:42.027
ORION: What do you mean? What do you want me to
do?

00:18:42.027 --> 00:18:45.629
MATT: Scanlan sees this.

00:18:45.629 --> 00:18:47.400
MARISHA: (Michael Jackson voice) That's ignorant.

00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:48.708
(laughter)

00:18:48.708 --> 00:18:53.232
MATT: Hears this, and instinctively without much
recourse, his invisibility fades as he begins to

00:18:53.232 --> 00:18:55.148
form an incantation.

00:18:55.148 --> 00:18:56.330
LAURA: Oh god.

00:18:56.330 --> 00:19:02.364
MATT: Thankfully, he's distracted at the moment,
but the large entity is going to attempt--

00:19:02.364 --> 00:19:04.112
LIAM: So helpful if he was here.

00:19:04.112 --> 00:19:05.392
LAURA: I know, I just wish--

00:19:05.392 --> 00:19:07.272
LIAM: I know he's got a great plan, on the 5.

00:19:07.272 --> 00:19:08.636
MATT: I'm sure he does.

00:19:08.636 --> 00:19:10.469
TALIESIN: Not texting it to us.

00:19:10.469 --> 00:19:14.322
MATT: See if he sent something to me. Yeah, he
texted me the same stuff, all right!

00:19:14.322 --> 00:19:17.323
ORION: Guys, I'm just gonna sing a song right
now.

00:19:17.323 --> 00:19:21.891
MATT: So, no. What he's actually going to do is,
he's going to cast Domination.

00:19:21.891 --> 00:19:25.169
MARISHA: That's cool!

00:19:25.169 --> 00:19:27.125
LIAM: That is what he would want to do.

00:19:27.125 --> 00:19:30.312
TALIESIN: That's what he would want if he were
here.

00:19:30.312 --> 00:19:34.864
MATT: So, as he finishes the spell, the giant
creature, as he starts reaching and pulling the

00:19:34.864 --> 00:19:40.450
sheets back, it pulls back right as you guys see
its horrible, gnarled face right in front of you.

00:19:40.450 --> 00:19:44.799
Its nose, you can see, dripping with liquid from
somewhere inside. As you pull back your blade, all

00:19:44.799 --> 00:19:50.269
of a sudden it stops, and looks up, turns around,
looking over at Scanlan on the edge. And Scanlan

00:19:50.269 --> 00:20:00.646
goes, "Hey, go for a walk." And the giant, "Okay."
Climbs up to where Scanlan is, and just starts

00:20:00.646 --> 00:20:03.609
walking towards the fungal forest at the edge of
the area.

00:20:03.609 --> 00:20:04.604
TRAVIS: What?!

00:20:04.604 --> 00:20:07.478
LAURA: Maybe call him back here and we can tie him
up. Is that dumb?

00:20:07.478 --> 00:20:11.921
MATT: "I don't know! Come back!" Scanlan says,
"Come back." The giant turns around.

00:20:11.921 --> 00:20:14.868
LAURA: Make him sit down.

00:20:14.868 --> 00:20:23.188
MATT: "Sit down!" It sits down. Still hasn't made
its saving throw.

00:20:23.188 --> 00:20:24.507
LAURA: Oh, okay.

00:20:24.507 --> 00:20:27.200
MATT: Even sitting, Scanlan is up to its knee.

00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:28.018
LAURA: Wow.

00:20:28.018 --> 00:20:32.122
MATT: You've seen giants, to an extent, at some
point, or larger creatures. An ogre would be about

00:20:32.122 --> 00:20:34.547
waist-high to this.

00:20:34.547 --> 00:20:35.721
LAURA: Can he talk?

00:20:35.721 --> 00:20:38.858
MATT: For just reference, there. That's about the
size you're looking at.

00:20:38.858 --> 00:20:40.473
LAURA: Oh! So he's really small.

00:20:40.473 --> 00:20:41.852
MATT: He's a tiny guy, tiny guy.

00:20:41.852 --> 00:20:43.438
TRAVIS: Yeah, he's like Rudy.

00:20:43.438 --> 00:20:45.092
LAURA: Should we capture him, or should we just--

00:20:45.092 --> 00:20:47.591
MATT: Scanlan goes, "You, wha--"

00:20:47.591 --> 00:20:48.865
TALIESIN: Capture him, capture him!

00:20:48.865 --> 00:20:50.555
MATT: "You told me to do something!" You guys
aren't there!

00:20:50.555 --> 00:20:51.870
LAURA: I don't think you know how big he is--

00:20:51.870 --> 00:20:53.403
TALIESIN: Scanlan would say, "Capture him!"

00:20:53.403 --> 00:20:54.872
MATT: I know, that's what we're working through.

00:20:54.872 --> 00:20:58.925
LIAM: Vax just backs back into the shadows, hoping
the giant forgets about him.

00:20:58.925 --> 00:21:01.042
LAURA: Thanks, vomit-y brother.

00:21:01.042 --> 00:21:02.672
MATT: Stealth check.

00:21:02.672 --> 00:21:04.771
ASHLEY: But what if we have him help us fight?

00:21:04.771 --> 00:21:06.104
LIAM: 27.

00:21:06.104 --> 00:21:14.778
LAURA: Can I bust out my rope of infinite twine
and start tying it around him? Just, a lot? A lot!

00:21:14.778 --> 00:21:18.607
Just a whole bunch. As much as possible. Because
it's infinite, this twine!

00:21:18.607 --> 00:21:24.822
MATT: All right. You get about a third of the way
through wrapping the rope around his body. He kind

00:21:24.822 --> 00:21:32.699
of just sits there looking confused at you. His
jaw looks slack. You continue to wrap, and as you

00:21:32.699 --> 00:21:38.783
are pulling on the second round, all of a sudden
his expression goes from dull slack, to angry.

00:21:38.783 --> 00:21:40.223
TRAVIS AND LAURA: Oh shit.

00:21:40.223 --> 00:21:46.577
MATT: He looks down at you, Scanlan goes, "Oops! I
think it's worn off." At which point he makes a

00:21:46.577 --> 00:21:52.978
tense, physical action against the rope that
you've bound him with, and before you have a

00:21:52.978 --> 00:21:57.165
moment to react, with a powerful surge of energy,
breaks through all the rope that you

00:21:57.165 --> 00:21:58.380
had tied him on.

00:21:58.380 --> 00:21:59.426
LAURA: Great.

00:21:59.426 --> 00:22:01.786
MATT: You are now standing at the base of him. At
which--

00:22:01.786 --> 00:22:03.507
ASHLEY: Where-- Go for it.

00:22:03.507 --> 00:22:04.784
MATT: You guys are on the shore.

00:22:04.784 --> 00:22:06.337
LIAM: Yeah, you guys are way far behind.

00:22:06.337 --> 00:22:07.892
LAURA: Oh, should we just run?

00:22:07.892 --> 00:22:09.175
TRAVIS: He's outside!

00:22:09.175 --> 00:22:10.249
LAURA: Scanlan is outside.

00:22:10.249 --> 00:22:18.441
MATT: Go, go. Someone let Sam in! All right, so as
this giant entity reaches over and is going to

00:22:18.441 --> 00:22:20.717
attempt to try and slam his fist down on top of
you.

00:22:20.717 --> 00:22:21.764
LAURA: Ah!

00:22:21.764 --> 00:22:24.408
MATT: That is going to be a 21.

00:22:24.408 --> 00:22:26.346
LAURA: Against my AC?

00:22:26.346 --> 00:22:27.785
MATT: Against your armor class, yes.

00:22:27.785 --> 00:22:29.171
LAURA: Oh no, that hits me!

00:22:29.171 --> 00:22:30.248
MATT: All right.

00:22:30.248 --> 00:22:31.442
LAURA: That doesn't count.

00:22:31.442 --> 00:22:36.858
MATT: You take 14 points of bludgeoning damage, as
the hand just slams down onto your sister.

00:22:36.858 --> 00:22:41.415
LIAM: I just run up the thing's back. I rolled 27
for that stealth, so presumably I'm--

00:22:41.415 --> 00:22:44.017
MATT: Presumably, he doesn't seem to notice you
there.

00:22:44.017 --> 00:22:47.405
LIAM: -- disappeared-ed-ed-ed. Yeah. So I'd like
to stab him in the back.

00:22:47.405 --> 00:22:49.710
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and make an attack roll on
that.

00:22:49.710 --> 00:22:51.405
LIAM: Okay.

00:22:51.405 --> 00:22:53.006
ORION: Hey, you're wearing a cool shirt.

00:22:53.006 --> 00:22:55.395
TRAVIS: Hey, buddy!

00:22:55.395 --> 00:22:56.561
LIAM: I miss, horribly.

00:22:56.561 --> 00:22:57.799
MATT: What'd you roll?

00:22:57.799 --> 00:22:59.001
LIAM: A one and a two.

00:22:59.001 --> 00:23:00.741
TRAVIS: Did you roll the meteorite yet?

00:23:00.741 --> 00:23:01.484
LIAM: No, not yet.

00:23:01.484 --> 00:23:02.468
TRAVIS: You ding-a-ling!

00:23:02.468 --> 00:23:04.850
ALL: Scanlan!

00:23:04.850 --> 00:23:06.927
LAURA: We need you!

00:23:06.927 --> 00:23:11.095
SAM: I hope you guys got my word that you did not
try to capture him, did you?

00:23:11.095 --> 00:23:13.594
TRAVIS: No, we didn't. And everything's gone
horribly wrong because of that.

00:23:13.594 --> 00:23:16.545
SAM: No, don't try to-- No, don't capture him,
that's a terrible idea!

00:23:16.545 --> 00:23:19.240
LAURA: Scanlan, you got me killed!

00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:21.953
TRAVIS: That's not what you said.

00:23:21.953 --> 00:23:24.734
LAURA: Oh no, it's starting.

00:23:24.734 --> 00:23:26.065
LIAM: It's too late.

00:23:26.065 --> 00:23:27.770
LAURA: We're already in the giant battle.

00:23:27.770 --> 00:23:31.087
LIAM: If you had been here five minutes earlier,
you might have helped shape what happened.

00:23:31.087 --> 00:23:32.524
SAM: Sorry.

00:23:32.524 --> 00:23:36.544
MATT: You do have one reaction to this, as you
stabbed and missed, you have a reaction as well,

00:23:36.544 --> 00:23:40.606
after you've taken it. You pull yourself from
under its fist, and it's now starting to get up

00:23:40.606 --> 00:23:46.960
onto its feet proper. Oh! What you got?

00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:48.426
SAM: He's moving?

00:23:48.426 --> 00:23:50.117
MATT: He's getting up now, he was sitting down.

00:23:50.117 --> 00:23:53.145
SAM: Bigby's Hand. Grab him. Grapple him.

00:23:53.145 --> 00:23:54.377
MATT: Okay, all right.

00:23:54.377 --> 00:23:55.429
ASHLEY: Grapple him?

00:23:55.429 --> 00:23:57.095
SAM: Yeah, I can grapple a massive beast.

00:23:57.095 --> 00:23:58.439
MATT: How big?

00:23:58.439 --> 00:23:59.926
SAM: It just says "Big."

00:23:59.926 --> 00:24:01.116
MATT: A Large?

00:24:01.116 --> 00:24:01.993
SAM: No.

00:24:01.993 --> 00:24:03.794
MATT: This creature constitutes as Huge.

00:24:03.794 --> 00:24:06.152
TRAVIS: Yeah, an ogre comes up to his waist.

00:24:06.152 --> 00:24:08.551
SAM: It can grapple a Huge or smaller creature.

00:24:08.551 --> 00:24:09.882
MATT: That'll do. Yeah.

00:24:09.882 --> 00:24:11.020
ALL: Yes!

00:24:11.020 --> 00:24:12.551
LAURA: Oh wow.

00:24:12.551 --> 00:24:17.870
MATT: All right, so. So go ahead and make a roll,
a contested roll for that, if you don't mind.

00:24:17.870 --> 00:24:22.695
(laughter)

00:24:22.695 --> 00:24:24.608
SAM: I'm here!

00:24:24.608 --> 00:24:27.077
MATT: You got this, you got this.

00:24:27.077 --> 00:24:28.698
SAM: Plus what?

00:24:28.698 --> 00:24:31.021
MATT: We're going to find out here in a second,
let me pull up the spell.

00:24:31.021 --> 00:24:39.816
SAM: I got it right here. Concentration--- No, AC.
The hand has an AC of--- No, here it is.

00:24:39.816 --> 00:24:45.533
MATT: All right, so. I got it right here. Grasping
Hand, all right. So use the hand's strength score

00:24:45.533 --> 00:24:50.143
to resolve the grapple. So you roll that and add
eight to it. What'd you roll on the d20?

00:24:50.143 --> 00:24:51.095
SAM: 18.

00:24:51.095 --> 00:24:59.026
MATT: 18? Plus eight, that's 26! All right, versus
its athletics. Okay. So as it's getting up,

00:24:59.026 --> 00:25:05.811
suddenly you freak out, bring your hand up, and
you summon that same sparkling wave of arcane

00:25:05.931 --> 00:25:11.884
energy that shoots out from your hands. Forms this
giant version of your hand. Clings around both his

00:25:11.884 --> 00:25:17.800
arms, his torso, and tightens itself around its
body. As it does, it stands up,

00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:19.377
and it's currently grappled.

00:25:19.377 --> 00:25:20.501
SAM: Yes!

00:25:20.501 --> 00:25:22.631
TRAVIS: Good job! You Dominated it earlier.

00:25:22.631 --> 00:25:24.628
SAM: I do that with people.

00:25:24.628 --> 00:25:26.716
MATT: Yeah, so mark off your Domination.

00:25:26.716 --> 00:25:28.219
SAM: Okay, got it.

00:25:28.219 --> 00:25:34.922
MATT: Also, the target takes 2d6 plus five damage,
crushing, as you're now grabbing

00:25:34.922 --> 00:25:36.914
and forcing its body.

00:25:36.914 --> 00:25:40.155
SAM: That's not very much, nine points total.

00:25:40.155 --> 00:25:48.304
MATT: Nine points of damage total to it. All
right, gotcha. To this wondrous entity. Yay! All

00:25:48.304 --> 00:25:58.391
right. All right, great. So that ends your turn.
It is currently grappled.

00:25:58.391 --> 00:26:00.276
LAURA: Do I have a reaction?

00:26:00.276 --> 00:26:01.603
MATT: It is now your turn.

00:26:01.603 --> 00:26:03.429
LAURA: Can I jump away as a reaction?

00:26:03.429 --> 00:26:09.350
MATT: You can. Go ahead, and we'll say you've been
down here, Scanlan is right here, and you are

00:26:09.350 --> 00:26:16.278
right here. Not with Trinket, because you went out
to scout and stealth. So that's you there.

00:26:16.278 --> 00:26:23.674
LAURA: Can I hit my earring up, and go: Giant!
Giant! Being attacked! Help!

00:26:23.674 --> 00:26:24.743
ASHLEY: Can we go?

00:26:24.743 --> 00:26:27.681
MATT: You guys hear that, those of you who have
earrings. Shout that out? The rest of you are

00:26:27.681 --> 00:26:28.600
starting to run.

00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:30.455
LIAM AND ASHLEY: (sing) Clang, clang, clang!

00:26:30.455 --> 00:26:32.014
(laughter)

00:26:32.014 --> 00:26:35.307
MATT: At full-round sprints, yeah. It's not going
to be a very quiet walk for Pike.

00:26:35.307 --> 00:26:36.671
ASHLEY: Hey, I don't need to be stealthy, now!

00:26:36.671 --> 00:26:40.849
MATT: That's okay. It'll take you guys about two
rounds to get there. At a full round. So--

00:26:40.849 --> 00:26:42.147
LIAM: Appreciate it.

00:26:42.147 --> 00:26:43.940
TRAVIS: I just run towards the pleasant smells.

00:26:43.940 --> 00:26:53.585
LAURA: And I'm going to take out one of my--
Hunter's Mark! And one of my Sleep arrows. And I

00:26:53.585 --> 00:26:55.017
want to shoot it with my Sleep arrow.

00:26:55.017 --> 00:26:55.955
TRAVIS: A what?

00:26:55.955 --> 00:26:56.943
MATT: Okay.

00:26:56.943 --> 00:26:58.641
LAURA: I have a Sleep arrow.

00:26:58.641 --> 00:27:00.097
TRAVIS: Awesome. When did that happen?

00:27:00.097 --> 00:27:03.247
LAURA: I bought them. But I want Tiberius to make
me more.

00:27:03.247 --> 00:27:04.724
ORION: You what?

00:27:04.724 --> 00:27:07.842
LAURA: I've asked for more Sleep arrows, if you
can make them.

00:27:07.842 --> 00:27:10.633
ORION: It takes a while for me to do that.

00:27:10.633 --> 00:27:11.781
LAURA: Oh shit.

00:27:11.781 --> 00:27:13.171
TALIESIN: You also still have a Grapple arrow.

00:27:13.171 --> 00:27:14.005
LAURA: And that, I know!

00:27:14.005 --> 00:27:15.174
TRAVIS: So we've got two rounds to--

00:27:15.174 --> 00:27:19.117
LAURA: But after the rope, I'm going to try to
Sleep.

00:27:19.117 --> 00:27:20.461
TALIESIN: Yeah, I know, I know.

00:27:20.461 --> 00:27:23.432
ORION: It takes like at least a few hours to make
Sleep arrows, right?

00:27:23.432 --> 00:27:26.728
MATT: Oh, it takes a while to make a Sleep arrow,
yeah. It takes like-- Yeah, we'll go into that

00:27:26.728 --> 00:27:30.936
later. All right so, you go ahead and pull out the
single arrow first, or Sleep arrow first?

00:27:30.936 --> 00:27:32.710
LAURA: Sleep arrow first.

00:27:32.710 --> 00:27:35.139
MATT: Okay. You realize if you damage something
that's asleep, it wakes back up?

00:27:35.139 --> 00:27:36.974
MARISHA: Yeah, put him to sleep.

00:27:36.974 --> 00:27:37.975
LAURA: Yeah.

00:27:37.975 --> 00:27:40.414
MATT: I'm saying if you do Sleep arrow first, you
hit him, then you do a second,

00:27:40.414 --> 00:27:41.354
it'll wake back up.

00:27:41.354 --> 00:27:43.843
LAURA: Oh, okay. I'm going to do the first arrow
and then I'll try to put him to sleep. Okay,

00:27:43.843 --> 00:27:45.160
smart. Thank you.

00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:47.371
MATT: Just letting you know.

00:27:47.371 --> 00:27:50.724
LAURA: I know, right? 25 for the first hit.

00:27:50.724 --> 00:27:53.632
MATT: Okay. 25 definitely hits.

00:27:53.632 --> 00:27:57.802
LAURA: Oh, then eight, and--

00:27:57.802 --> 00:28:00.250
SAM: (shaky flute music)

00:28:00.250 --> 00:28:04.263
LAURA: 16 for the first hit.

00:28:04.263 --> 00:28:06.245
MATT: 16 damage for the first hit.

00:28:06.245 --> 00:28:08.285
LAURA: And then Sleep arrow.

00:28:08.285 --> 00:28:10.239
LAURA and ASHLEY: Oh, natural 20!

00:28:10.239 --> 00:28:12.263
(cheering)

00:28:12.263 --> 00:28:13.642
MATT: Fantastic!

00:28:13.642 --> 00:28:15.085
ASHLEY: Nighty night!

00:28:15.085 --> 00:28:16.427
MATT: Go ahead and roll damage on that!

00:28:16.427 --> 00:28:19.519
SAM: (shaky flute music)

00:28:19.519 --> 00:28:20.873
LAURA: Eight!

00:28:20.873 --> 00:28:22.028
SAM: Get used to that sound.

00:28:22.028 --> 00:28:26.200
LAURA: Eight plus seven is 15, 16, 17. Plus
Hunter's Mark.

00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:27.491
MATT: Did you multiply the dice?

00:28:27.491 --> 00:28:28.631
LAURA: Oh, no!

00:28:28.631 --> 00:28:29.672
MATT: That's a critical hit.

00:28:29.672 --> 00:28:35.174
LAURA: Oh sweet. Eight, 16, do I add the two for
the bracers on that?

00:28:35.174 --> 00:28:37.691
MATT: Not for the multiplication, no. It's after
the fact.

00:28:37.691 --> 00:28:41.745
LAURA: Okay, 16, 20, what is that? 23, 24, 25.

00:28:41.745 --> 00:28:42.784
MATT: 25.

00:28:42.784 --> 00:28:44.010
LAURA: Plus Hunter's Mark?

00:28:44.010 --> 00:28:45.502
MATT: Yep.

00:28:45.502 --> 00:28:46.838
LAURA: Five for Hunter's Mark.

00:28:46.838 --> 00:28:47.708
LIAM: Nice!

00:28:47.708 --> 00:28:48.703
MATT: 30 damage.

00:28:48.703 --> 00:28:49.754
ASHLEY: You put him in a coma.

00:28:49.754 --> 00:28:50.652
LIAM: Nice!

00:28:50.652 --> 00:28:51.573
ASHLEY: He's not just sleeping.

00:28:51.573 --> 00:28:54.091
MATT: All right, so as it's still standing up and
you see as he's standing up now, he's reaching off

00:28:54.091 --> 00:28:58.074
to the side and he's pulling a giant club up that
was kind of leaning against the side of the inner

00:28:58.074 --> 00:29:02.362
portion of this giant fighter's ring.

00:29:02.362 --> 00:29:03.325
TRAVIS: Good choice.

00:29:03.325 --> 00:29:06.368
MATT: As he pulls the club up, you pierce him in
the arm with the first arrow and he looks down at

00:29:06.368 --> 00:29:11.352
you angrily. With his one giant eye glaring, and
the smaller one. The second arrow pierces the

00:29:11.352 --> 00:29:19.899
smaller eye and he pulls the arrow out with his
fingers, like a little tweezers, angrily. I will

00:29:19.899 --> 00:29:24.561
say, because it was a critical hit on a Sleep
arrow, normally, what you would roll is 5d8 to see

00:29:24.561 --> 00:29:27.208
how many hit points it can affect. Go ahead and
roll 10d8.

00:29:27.208 --> 00:29:28.847
ALL: Whoa!

00:29:28.847 --> 00:29:32.259
MATT: It's not damage. This is just to see whether
or not you can put it to sleep.

00:29:32.259 --> 00:29:33.470
LAURA: Oh, really?

00:29:33.470 --> 00:29:35.153
MARISHA: Oh, he's got to have a--

00:29:35.153 --> 00:29:49.485
LAURA: That's 12, okay. 16, 28. And then I get
another--

00:29:49.485 --> 00:29:51.174
TRAVIS: Four more.

00:29:51.174 --> 00:29:55.143
MARISHA: I've got access to this thing. Let me
show you.

00:29:55.143 --> 00:29:57.001
LIAM: You're at 39.

00:29:57.001 --> 00:29:58.983
SAM: Math is happening here. Action Math!

00:29:58.983 --> 00:30:00.182
LAURA: Wait, one more.

00:30:00.182 --> 00:30:01.753
MATT AND ORION: Action Math.

00:30:01.753 --> 00:30:02.984
LIAM: Aw. 47.

00:30:02.984 --> 00:30:04.160
LAURA: 47?

00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:05.258
MATT: 47.

00:30:05.258 --> 00:30:06.170
ORION: Nice!

00:30:06.170 --> 00:30:07.568
SAM: That's some hot math.

00:30:07.568 --> 00:30:10.104
MATT: So, the arrow pierces him and he pulls it
out, and you can see for a second

00:30:10.104 --> 00:30:11.832
the eye gets a little--

00:30:11.832 --> 00:30:13.272
LAURA: Oh, come on, come on.

00:30:13.272 --> 00:30:16.847
MATT: He flicks the arrow off and it snaps as it
leaves his fingers, and he glares down at you with

00:30:16.847 --> 00:30:19.655
his other eye, angrily. Shrugs off the effect.

00:30:19.655 --> 00:30:21.041
ASHLEY: No!

00:30:21.041 --> 00:30:22.923
LAURA: Man! That would have been-- that's
impossible!

00:30:22.923 --> 00:30:25.467
MATT: That would have been really cool.
Unfortunately, he still has a lot of hit points

00:30:25.467 --> 00:30:29.817
left. Sleep arrow is something to glide into later
in the battle.

00:30:29.817 --> 00:30:31.482
TRAVIS: Oh, that makes sense.

00:30:31.482 --> 00:30:33.633
LAURA: Oh, that does make sense.

00:30:33.633 --> 00:30:34.850
TRAVIS: How many would've done it?

00:30:34.850 --> 00:30:36.160
LAURA: He can't tell us that.

00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:38.599
MATT: You don't know that. No fucking-- You're
still on the beach!

00:30:38.599 --> 00:30:42.557
LAURA: Did I still do 47 damage on that Sleep
arrow? Or that was just--

00:30:42.557 --> 00:30:44.480
MATT: Oh no, you still did the 30 damage from the
Sleep arrow.

00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:45.492
LAURA: Okay, okay.

00:30:45.492 --> 00:30:48.469
MATT: That was just to see how much hit points it
would affect if it was going to put him to sleep.

00:30:48.469 --> 00:30:49.787
But a nice try.

00:30:49.787 --> 00:30:50.746
LAURA: All right.

00:30:50.746 --> 00:30:54.631
MATT: All right, so that ends your turn. That
brings us back to the top of the round between you

00:30:54.631 --> 00:30:57.390
guys. So we'll wait for the rest to arrive before
we do full initiative. We're just running off of

00:30:57.390 --> 00:31:00.629
the sequence of events here. Did you want to move
at all or are you going to stay right here?

00:31:00.629 --> 00:31:03.068
LAURA: I want to run as far away as possible from
him.

00:31:03.068 --> 00:31:10.175
MATT: Okay. So, as you start running backward,
we'll say to about there, he has a very long reach

00:31:10.175 --> 00:31:15.473
with a club and he gets to swing at you as a
reaction. So as you go bolting, he just takes the

00:31:15.473 --> 00:31:17.986
giant club around (whoosh).

00:31:17.986 --> 00:31:19.749
LAURA: You're not groggy at all, you little--

00:31:19.749 --> 00:31:21.141
MATT: Streaks it across the ground.

00:31:21.141 --> 00:31:22.422
SAM: You're grappled.

00:31:22.422 --> 00:31:31.738
MATT: Yep, which means he's in a bad situation and
he, because he is grappled, it means he can't move

00:31:31.738 --> 00:31:34.819
from his current spot. He's being held in place.
His speed is zero.

00:31:34.819 --> 00:31:36.496
LIAM: Checking the stats.

00:31:36.496 --> 00:31:39.226
MATT: But he still manages to roll a 14 to hit.

00:31:39.226 --> 00:31:40.830
LAURA: And he doesn't hit me.

00:31:40.830 --> 00:31:44.270
MATT: All right, so you jump over the club.

00:31:44.270 --> 00:31:45.320
LAURA: Sweet.

00:31:45.320 --> 00:31:48.773
MATT: Roll off the ground, turn around. Get your
bow back in ready position, untouched. That's the

00:31:48.773 --> 00:31:50.616
end of your turn. Now it's his turn.

00:31:50.616 --> 00:31:51.808
LAURA: Oh god!

00:31:51.808 --> 00:31:57.539
MATT: He is going to-- Did you throw the daggers
or did you leap up to try and backstab him there?

00:31:57.539 --> 00:31:59.238
LIAM: I tried to backstab him so I'm right
behind.

00:31:59.238 --> 00:32:00.916
MATT: Right, so you're right there. He--

00:32:00.916 --> 00:32:02.734
LIAM: He's gonna shit on me, isn't he?

00:32:02.734 --> 00:32:09.234
MATT: -- spins around. Bends down, just glares at
you with his one giant yellowish eye with almost a

00:32:09.234 --> 00:32:10.996
slit pupil in it.

00:32:10.996 --> 00:32:12.371
LIAM: Hello, handsome.

00:32:12.371 --> 00:32:16.424
MATT: As it does, you feel this strange,
oppressive force come from the eye into your mind,

00:32:16.424 --> 00:32:20.820
and I need you to go ahead and roll a charisma
saving throw.

00:32:20.820 --> 00:32:22.093
TRAVIS: Roll the meteorite.

00:32:22.093 --> 00:32:23.686
LIAM: I'm going to use the meteorite.

00:32:23.686 --> 00:32:25.081
LAURA: All right, come on, meteorite.

00:32:25.081 --> 00:32:26.850
LIAM: That's better. 17.

00:32:26.850 --> 00:32:28.570
MATT: 17?

00:32:28.570 --> 00:32:29.748
LIAM: Yes.

00:32:29.748 --> 00:32:36.496
MATT: You manage to resist whatever effect this
was. You shrug it off. It looks at you angrily

00:32:36.496 --> 00:32:39.817
even more and takes its club and slams it into the
ground, like a giant pouty child.

00:32:39.817 --> 00:32:41.151
LIAM: (retches) Sorry.

00:32:41.151 --> 00:32:44.813
MATT: It looks like it's-- Yeah. The smell is
still present in your face. Pulls its club up to

00:32:44.813 --> 00:32:51.483
prepare itself for its next round. That's its
turn. Oh, no, sorry. It also makes one attack, it

00:32:51.483 --> 00:32:54.695
gets to use the evil eye, and one attack. So,
angrily, it's gonna lift up its club and slam down

00:32:54.695 --> 00:32:55.663
towards you.

00:32:55.663 --> 00:32:56.617
LIAM: Yes.

00:32:56.617 --> 00:32:59.177
MATT: That is going to be a 15 versus AC?

00:32:59.177 --> 00:33:00.302
LIAM: No, sorry.

00:33:00.302 --> 00:33:04.846
MATT: Can't roll worth crap today. Club comes down
(impact sound). Actually breaks a good portion of

00:33:04.846 --> 00:33:08.333
the stone on the side of this that comes up,
falling backward and tumbling into a pile inside

00:33:08.333 --> 00:33:14.847
this pit. As you dodge out of the way. That ends
its turn. No, you're up.

00:33:14.847 --> 00:33:15.891
LIAM: I'm up?

00:33:15.891 --> 00:33:18.737
MATT: Scanlan. No, Scanlan first, and then you,
and then you. So Scanlan.

00:33:18.737 --> 00:33:19.647
SAM: Oh, me?

00:33:19.647 --> 00:33:20.395
MATT: Yes.

00:33:20.395 --> 00:33:21.269
SAM: I get to do more?

00:33:21.269 --> 00:33:22.412
MATT: Yes.

00:33:22.412 --> 00:33:23.671
SAM: But he's a giant, and I'm a little thing.

00:33:23.671 --> 00:33:25.066
MATT: Yes, you are. Yes, he is.

00:33:25.066 --> 00:33:27.693
SAM: I guess I should hit him. I'm going to hit
him with a Lightning Bolt.

00:33:27.693 --> 00:33:28.672
LIAM: You should come in close.

00:33:28.672 --> 00:33:29.962
MATT: Okay.

00:33:29.962 --> 00:33:31.142
SAM: I should come in close?

00:33:31.142 --> 00:33:33.474
LIAM: Then I can fuck him up.

00:33:33.474 --> 00:33:36.748
SAM: Oh. But he's big, and I'm little!

00:33:36.748 --> 00:33:38.799
LAURA: No, don't come in close, seriously.

00:33:38.799 --> 00:33:40.584
TRAVIS: You're real little, like the size of a
toe.

00:33:40.584 --> 00:33:43.316
LAURA: Honestly, he can still get you from where
you're at. Unless you move further away.

00:33:43.316 --> 00:33:49.079
LIAM: Yeah, so it's the same: right up against him
or five feet back. Same same! If you move away,

00:33:49.079 --> 00:33:54.232
he's gonna take a swing. I'm not saying any of
this, I'm just thinking it, furiously.

00:33:54.232 --> 00:33:56.200
SAM: Yes, thinking it at me.

00:33:56.200 --> 00:33:57.470
ORION: You yell it across.

00:33:57.470 --> 00:34:02.572
SAM: I'll just make-- Does Lightning Bolt come
from me, or can--

00:34:02.572 --> 00:34:04.999
MATT: Yes, it comes from you. And it goes in a
straight direction.

00:34:04.999 --> 00:34:08.237
SAM: Well then, I have to move anyway, so that I
don't strike Vax or Vex.

00:34:08.237 --> 00:34:12.386
MATT: You get the feeling he has about a 15 foot
reach with this, so as long as you stay within

00:34:12.386 --> 00:34:14.292
that reach, you're still gonna be okay.

00:34:14.292 --> 00:34:16.511
SAM: Well, will I hit either of my fellows from
where I'm--

00:34:16.511 --> 00:34:18.258
MATT: Currently? Yes.

00:34:18.258 --> 00:34:19.597
SAM: Yeah, then I need to move.

00:34:19.597 --> 00:34:21.344
MATT: You do. Where are you going to move?

00:34:21.344 --> 00:34:22.883
TRAVIS: What, they can't take it?

00:34:22.883 --> 00:34:24.755
SAM: That ring, is that high? Low?

00:34:24.755 --> 00:34:28.310
MATT: It's 15 feet up, so you can jump down into
the ring if you wanted to go down there. Or you

00:34:28.310 --> 00:34:29.674
can move around this way.

00:34:29.674 --> 00:34:35.631
SAM: Oh gosh. I don't really jump well. All right,
I'm going to jump into the ring, I guess. And then

00:34:35.631 --> 00:34:38.670
can I shoot from there or will the wall be in my
way?

00:34:38.670 --> 00:34:40.076
MATT: He's big enough where you'd be able to see
him.

00:34:40.076 --> 00:34:40.866
SAM: Okay.

00:34:40.866 --> 00:34:46.978
MATT: So you leap off the side. As you leap in the
air, he glances over with his large eye and does a

00:34:46.978 --> 00:34:51.165
backswing with the club in mid-air, trying to
basically baseball-swing you.

00:34:51.165 --> 00:34:52.560
SAM: Oh, he'll hit me.

00:34:52.560 --> 00:34:55.468
MATT: We'll find out. That is an 18?

00:34:55.468 --> 00:34:56.615
SAM: Oh yeah.

00:34:56.615 --> 00:35:02.710
MATT: Okay. You take 19 points of bludgeoning
damage. As he (impact sound).

00:35:02.710 --> 00:35:03.910
TRAVIS: Tee-balls you.

00:35:03.910 --> 00:35:06.121
MATT: Really. Like, backhand swing hits you.

00:35:06.121 --> 00:35:07.385
SAM: (high-pitched) Ah!

00:35:07.385 --> 00:35:11.428
MATT: Go ahead and make an acrobatics check.
Because your landing has now completely thrown you

00:35:11.428 --> 00:35:13.911
topsy-turvy, the impact throwing you off your
balance.

00:35:13.911 --> 00:35:15.195
(laughter)

00:35:15.195 --> 00:35:16.798
SAM: Does a 20-- Is that good?

00:35:16.798 --> 00:35:17.811
MATT: 20 will do.

00:35:17.811 --> 00:35:19.320
ASHLEY: 20 will do!

00:35:19.320 --> 00:35:22.909
MATT: Like a cat, you correct your trajectory in
mid-air and still three-point land.

00:35:22.909 --> 00:35:25.879
(laughter)

00:35:25.879 --> 00:35:33.147
MATT: Down below. You're down in the pit, you're
looking up. This gargantuan humanoid is still

00:35:33.147 --> 00:35:37.214
standing above you, looking down hissing at you as
you still manage to not be affected by its swing

00:35:37.214 --> 00:35:40.168
at you. You can now cast your spell if you'd
like.

00:35:40.168 --> 00:35:44.043
SAM: Okay, I will cast Lightning Bolt on his face
and neck area.

00:35:44.043 --> 00:35:45.056
MATT: All right.

00:35:45.056 --> 00:35:45.921
TRAVIS: Good.

00:35:45.921 --> 00:35:47.475
MATT: Go ahead and roll 8d6.

00:35:47.475 --> 00:35:49.425
SAM: 8d6, give me those sixes.

00:35:49.425 --> 00:35:51.413
ORION: Boom! How many do you need? I got much.

00:35:51.413 --> 00:35:52.861
SAM: I need all of them.

00:35:52.861 --> 00:35:54.935
MATT: Dexterity, he does not make his saving
throw.

00:35:54.935 --> 00:35:55.841
TRAVIS: Yes!

00:35:55.841 --> 00:35:58.277
MATT: He is too slow at that size.

00:35:58.277 --> 00:36:03.522
SAM: Ooh, a lot of sixes. Six, six, six.

00:36:03.522 --> 00:36:05.999
ORION: What am I doing right now?

00:36:05.999 --> 00:36:07.791
MATT: You guys are running up to--

00:36:07.791 --> 00:36:08.766
SAM: 31.

00:36:08.766 --> 00:36:09.972
MATT: 31 total?

00:36:09.972 --> 00:36:11.401
LAURA: 31?! Nice.

00:36:11.401 --> 00:36:12.622
TRAVIS: All right. Drop it.

00:36:12.622 --> 00:36:16.751
MATT: So after you land on your foot, you turn
around, and reactively just fire this bolt of

00:36:16.751 --> 00:36:21.565
bluish, arcane energy. It streaks up, slams into
his face and shoulder area. You can see he rears

00:36:21.565 --> 00:36:27.606
back from the pain of it, reaching up in the air
like he can somehow fight off the Lightning Bolt.

00:36:27.606 --> 00:36:32.697
As the bolt passes through him, it leaves this
burn mark on his chest and the side of his face.

00:36:32.697 --> 00:36:36.165
Smoke is (sizzle) up off his torso. He looks very
pissed.

00:36:36.165 --> 00:36:37.531
SAM: Do I get my bonus?

00:36:37.531 --> 00:36:38.802
MATT: You do.

00:36:38.802 --> 00:36:41.962
SAM: Can I give Inspiration to mister Vax over
there?

00:36:41.962 --> 00:36:43.168
MATT: You may.

00:36:43.168 --> 00:36:45.347
SAM: (bad flute playing)

00:36:45.347 --> 00:36:46.671
TRAVIS: I don't know, can you?

00:36:46.671 --> 00:36:48.658
SAM: (slightly less bad flute playing)

00:36:48.658 --> 00:36:50.132
TRAVIS: There you go.

00:36:50.132 --> 00:36:52.686
MARISHA: Yeah, some Jethro Tull up in here.

00:36:52.686 --> 00:36:55.502
LIAM: (sings) You got the touch! You got the
power!

00:36:55.502 --> 00:37:03.988
MATT: I will say the mild, echoing sound of mildly
off-key whistle following a mighty Lightning Bolt,

00:37:03.988 --> 00:37:06.158
is inspiring enough. Go ahead and take a d10.

00:37:06.158 --> 00:37:07.429
LIAM: Okay.

00:37:07.429 --> 00:37:09.224
MATT: And now it is your turn.

00:37:09.224 --> 00:37:14.701
LIAM: I'm going to use that. I want to make an
acrobatics check. I want to jump up on this guy's

00:37:14.701 --> 00:37:20.440
knee, and then dagger-dagger right into his
strange eye that he tried to mess with me.

00:37:20.440 --> 00:37:22.595
MATT: Okay, so are you going directly for the
eye?

00:37:22.595 --> 00:37:25.696
LIAM: The eye, yeah, so I want to jump up his
body, off his knee.

00:37:25.696 --> 00:37:27.389
LAURA: (sultry) Jump up his body.

00:37:27.389 --> 00:37:29.585
LIAM: So what do I do? Acrobatics check first?

00:37:29.585 --> 00:37:30.861
MATT: Acrobatics check.

00:37:30.861 --> 00:37:37.760
LIAM: Okay, so four. I'm going to use Luck. 19 for
the second, so that's 19 plus 13, so I'm pretty

00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:39.001
sure I succeed.

00:37:39.001 --> 00:37:42.065
MATT: So as he's reeling back from the blast of
the Lightning Bolt, you see that opportunity. You

00:37:42.065 --> 00:37:45.826
jump up onto his partially bent knee, use that as
a platform and leap up in the air, daggers drawn.

00:37:45.826 --> 00:37:51.821
Slow motion towards its face. Go ahead and make
your first attack, since you are going directly

00:37:51.821 --> 00:37:52.840
for the eye--

00:37:52.840 --> 00:37:53.891
LIAM: Yes?

00:37:53.891 --> 00:37:57.596
MATT: I will say that it is at a disadvantage on
the attack, but if it hits, it will be considered

00:37:57.596 --> 00:37:59.169
as a Sneak Attack.

00:37:59.169 --> 00:37:59.982
LIAM: Say that again.

00:37:59.982 --> 00:38:04.770
MATT: I will say it's a disadvantage on the
attack, but if it hits him in his eye, you will do

00:38:04.770 --> 00:38:06.147
Sneak Attack damage.

00:38:06.147 --> 00:38:07.179
TRAVIS: Roll well.

00:38:07.179 --> 00:38:09.595
LIAM: All right, meteorite die.

00:38:09.595 --> 00:38:16.143
No good. First one's no good, second dagger.
That's good, and that's also good, identical, so

00:38:16.220 --> 00:38:18.545
that is a 26.

00:38:18.545 --> 00:38:21.865
MATT: 26. All right, that one will hit.

00:38:21.865 --> 00:38:28.615
LIAM: Thank you, meteorite die. Okay, so this is
1d-- durdee durdeedoo?

00:38:28.615 --> 00:38:30.687
ASHLEY: Hurkee durkee durkee.

00:38:30.687 --> 00:38:36.565
LIAM: Okay, that's a two, plus six is eight.

00:38:36.565 --> 00:38:38.681
MATT: Eight, plus your 5d6.

00:38:38.681 --> 00:38:40.166
LIAM: Oh, this is a Sneak Attack?

00:38:40.166 --> 00:38:41.447
LAURA: Because you hit him in the eye.

00:38:41.447 --> 00:38:42.852
MATT: Oh, this is the second attack that you did,
right?

00:38:42.852 --> 00:38:43.681
LIAM: Yeah.

00:38:43.681 --> 00:38:45.534
MATT: Technically, you were both going for the
eye. I'll say, I'll allow it.

00:38:45.534 --> 00:38:54.219
LIAM: Hey, you're a nice guy. Eight, is 12. And is
17. And 18. And 22. And is 26.

00:38:54.219 --> 00:38:55.839
MATT: 26 points of damage.

00:38:55.839 --> 00:38:57.095
LIAM: Eyeball.

00:38:57.095 --> 00:39:01.632
MATT: So, the first dagger you attempt to swing
down, he actually moves his face out of the way

00:39:01.632 --> 00:39:05.682
and it just scrapes across the side of his cheek,
doing nothing more than a scratch. But the second

00:39:05.682 --> 00:39:12.633
blade strikes true, slamming into the side of the
eye. As it pierces, for an eye, you expect, would

00:39:12.633 --> 00:39:16.454
pop. It's still a hearty material. You actually
have to push into it, it's almost like it's full

00:39:16.454 --> 00:39:21.091
of hot muscle on the inside of its eye. The dagger
still drives in, and, using your weight, you drag

00:39:21.091 --> 00:39:25.334
down and cut it open on the bottom. It screams out
in pain and pushes you off. You barely manage to

00:39:25.334 --> 00:39:26.883
catch yourself on the ground.

00:39:26.883 --> 00:39:28.310
ASHLEY: Oh, come on!

00:39:28.310 --> 00:39:32.298
MATT: You haven't, seemingly, blinded him, but
you've definitely left a serious

00:39:32.298 --> 00:39:34.178
mark on his eyeball.

00:39:34.178 --> 00:39:36.277
LAURA: Ugh. He's huge!

00:39:36.277 --> 00:39:38.508
MATT: Do you want to use your movement at all, you
can, or do you wanna stay where you are?

00:39:38.508 --> 00:39:46.460
LIAM: I will Disengage and move back, which means
that he can't take a swing.

00:39:46.460 --> 00:39:49.975
MATT: Right, you can use your bonus action. Oh,
you used your bonus action

00:39:49.975 --> 00:39:52.593
to do your secondary attack.

00:39:52.593 --> 00:39:59.035
LIAM: I'm pretty sure I get that on top of that,
as a Rogue hoo-hah. But I'll stay there if you

00:39:59.035 --> 00:40:02.449
want. I'm in no mood to argue with you tonight.

00:40:02.449 --> 00:40:03.656
MATT: I know, I know.

00:40:03.656 --> 00:40:04.607
TRAVIS: Yeah, right?

00:40:04.607 --> 00:40:07.040
MATT: I'm pretty sure as a rogue you can use your
bonus action to do Disengage, that's one of the

00:40:07.040 --> 00:40:10.929
benefits. But you used it as a secondary attack to
get Sneak Attack, so. You could move out of the

00:40:10.929 --> 00:40:12.487
way, but you'll take a swing from him.

00:40:12.487 --> 00:40:16.036
LIAM: Okay. Yeah, I'll move back.

00:40:16.036 --> 00:40:17.200
MATT: All right.

00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:18.101
LIAM: Sure.

00:40:18.101 --> 00:40:19.339
MATT: So you'd say you'd move back to about
there?

00:40:19.339 --> 00:40:20.446
LIAM: Yeah.

00:40:20.446 --> 00:40:24.013
MATT: As you do, he reaches up and grabs his eye.
With the other hand, picks up the club and

00:40:24.013 --> 00:40:28.259
backhand swings at you. That'll be a 19.

00:40:28.259 --> 00:40:29.324
LIAM: That hits.

00:40:29.324 --> 00:40:31.196
TRAVIS: Couldn't just let him go in the trees.

00:40:31.196 --> 00:40:36.469
MATT: You take 19 points of bludgeoning damage.
But as the hit slams into your back, you manage to

00:40:36.469 --> 00:40:40.083
just catch your feet underneath you so you don't
topple off the top of this edge.

00:40:40.083 --> 00:40:41.767
LIAM: Okay.

00:40:41.767 --> 00:40:43.948
MATT: Ends your turn. What you got, Vex?

00:40:43.948 --> 00:40:48.974
LAURA: Hi. I'm going to do Hail of Thorns on him.

00:40:48.974 --> 00:40:50.319
MATT: All right, so you pull back.

00:40:50.319 --> 00:40:51.490
LAURA: Yeah.

00:40:51.490 --> 00:40:56.271
MATT: Same wooden shaft, all of a sudden, sprouts
these nice, thorny, jagged spikes on the sides, as

00:40:56.271 --> 00:40:57.668
you release the arrow.

00:40:57.668 --> 00:40:58.763
LAURA: 26?

00:40:58.763 --> 00:40:59.729
MATT: Hits him.

00:40:59.729 --> 00:41:04.538
LAURA: Okay, so that would be-- I'm doing it at a
level three, so that is 3d10.

00:41:04.538 --> 00:41:06.385
MATT: 3d10 damage. Go ahead and roll that.

00:41:06.385 --> 00:41:22.518
LAURA: 15, 16. That 16? Yeah, 16 damage for that,
plus my Hunter's Mark. 17.

00:41:22.518 --> 00:41:24.208
MATT: 17?

00:41:24.208 --> 00:41:25.564
LAURA: And then my second attack?

00:41:25.564 --> 00:41:27.024
MATT: Second attack. Go ahead and roll it.

00:41:27.024 --> 00:41:30.373
LAURA: All right. 17?

00:41:30.373 --> 00:41:36.280
MATT: 17 does hit. He's pretty big. He's a big ol'
sack of hit points and no armor.

00:41:36.280 --> 00:41:38.866
LAURA: 15, 16, 17.

00:41:38.866 --> 00:41:39.868
MATT: 17.

00:41:39.868 --> 00:41:40.871
LAURA: Oh, plus Hunter's Mark!

00:41:40.871 --> 00:41:42.613
MATT: Yep, don't forget your Hunter's Mark.

00:41:42.613 --> 00:41:43.985
LAURA: Five for Hunter's Mark.

00:41:43.985 --> 00:41:50.268
MATT: Okay, so 22. Nice. All right, so, one arrow
hits him in the elbow and it looks like it pierces

00:41:50.268 --> 00:41:54.763
the sinew that holds the arm. Almost goes slack
for a second before he flexes and tenses. You hear

00:41:54.763 --> 00:42:00.523
the actual wood shaft snap as he brings his
forearm up. Grabbing his club, turning around, you

00:42:00.523 --> 00:42:03.577
shoot the back of his elbow, causing him to drop
the club on this hand. He looks extremely

00:42:03.577 --> 00:42:06.403
frustrated at the process. Now he's got blood
streaking down both arms.

00:42:06.403 --> 00:42:07.537
TRAVIS: Yes!

00:42:07.537 --> 00:42:10.028
MATT: He reaches down to grab the club, again, to
try and prepare himself for

00:42:10.028 --> 00:42:11.613
another round of attacks.

00:42:11.613 --> 00:42:13.525
MARISHA: Are we there yet?

00:42:13.525 --> 00:42:15.820
MATT: You guys are just now arriving.

00:42:15.820 --> 00:42:16.738
LAURA: Oh!

00:42:16.738 --> 00:42:18.948
MATT: The Fomorian is going to finish its turn,
and then the rest of you guys can go.

00:42:18.948 --> 00:42:20.117
TALIESIN: Yeah!

00:42:20.117 --> 00:42:26.700
MATT: He's going to take two swings. First, he's
going go ahead and angrily leap forward to there.

00:42:26.700 --> 00:42:31.315
Small jump. Lands on the ground, takes one swing
at each of you.

00:42:31.315 --> 00:42:32.488
SAM: Can he move?

00:42:32.488 --> 00:42:33.649
MARISHA: Is he still grappled?

00:42:33.649 --> 00:42:35.644
MATT: Actually, no that's a valid point. He is
still grappled. Thank you for that.

00:42:35.644 --> 00:42:37.190
LAURA: Yeah! Woo!

00:42:37.190 --> 00:42:43.673
MATT: He's going to try and break from the grapple
for his move. That is going to be an athletics of

00:42:43.673 --> 00:42:47.418
20. Go ahead and roll a d20 and add eight.

00:42:47.418 --> 00:42:48.699
MARISHA: Come on!

00:42:48.699 --> 00:42:50.992
SAM: 18 plus eight.

00:42:50.992 --> 00:42:52.466
(cheering)

00:42:52.466 --> 00:42:56.119
MATT: Attempts to break free of grapple, can't do,
so he's stuck where he is. He currently has

00:42:56.119 --> 00:42:57.689
nothing in range to attack.

00:42:57.689 --> 00:42:58.791
SAM: Except for me.

00:42:58.791 --> 00:43:04.235
MATT: No, you're 15 feet below, he doesn't have
range on you at the moment. He tries to take a

00:43:04.235 --> 00:43:08.568
swing at you, but partially because he's so high
up, he cannot move. And because you are so small,

00:43:08.568 --> 00:43:13.562
you literally just stand there as the swing-- The
wind blows your hair back a little bit.

00:43:13.562 --> 00:43:14.991
SAM: Ooh!

00:43:14.991 --> 00:43:16.322
(laughter)

00:43:16.322 --> 00:43:17.862
MATT: But does not find purchase on your body.

00:43:17.862 --> 00:43:20.087
SAM: I'm a little dainty gnome!

00:43:20.087 --> 00:43:21.785
(laughter)

00:43:21.785 --> 00:43:29.470
MATT: Completely wasted its turn, well done. All
right, so that brings us to you, again. Actually,

00:43:29.470 --> 00:43:32.099
no. It now goes to everyone else because they have
all arrived on the scene now.

00:43:32.099 --> 00:43:33.865
SAM: Right, good, thank god.

00:43:33.865 --> 00:43:36.098
MATT: You guys are all starting to appear. We'll
say--

00:43:36.098 --> 00:43:38.027
SAM: Don't kill the giant!

00:43:38.027 --> 00:43:39.841
MATT: Over this area.

00:43:39.841 --> 00:43:40.945
SAM: Don't kill him.

00:43:40.945 --> 00:43:42.172
ASHLEY: Don't kill him, still?

00:43:42.172 --> 00:43:43.959
SAM: Don't kill him, we need him.

00:43:43.959 --> 00:43:45.292
LAURA: For what?

00:43:45.292 --> 00:43:46.471
ASHLEY: How are we going to use him?

00:43:46.471 --> 00:43:49.747
SAM: We have a mind flayer, we have magicians, we
have all sorts of things. He is our wrecking ball.

00:43:49.747 --> 00:43:50.959
He's our way in.

00:43:50.959 --> 00:43:57.873
MARISHA: Yeah, if we can keep him controlled. I
can get him mind-controlled on our team

00:43:57.873 --> 00:43:58.960
for 30 days.

00:43:58.960 --> 00:44:01.024
SAM: Yeah, yeah. He is our ticket into the
palace.

00:44:01.024 --> 00:44:03.180
LAURA: All right.

00:44:03.180 --> 00:44:06.810
MARISHA: He's going to be like that one scene in
Lord of the Rings.

00:44:06.810 --> 00:44:08.141
LAURA: Ooh, I like it.

00:44:08.141 --> 00:44:09.185
TALIESIN: That one scene?

00:44:09.185 --> 00:44:10.757
LIAM: Where he ate the Lembas bread?

00:44:10.757 --> 00:44:12.025
TALIESIN: I love that one scene.

00:44:12.025 --> 00:44:14.717
MATT: So, who's going first?

00:44:14.717 --> 00:44:16.570
TALIESIN: Should we roll initiative?

00:44:16.570 --> 00:44:17.637
MATT: All right.

00:44:17.637 --> 00:44:18.958
TALIESIN: Okay.

00:44:18.958 --> 00:44:20.680
LAURA: Oh, we haven't rolled!

00:44:20.680 --> 00:44:22.025
LIAM: Everybody all together, now?

00:44:22.025 --> 00:44:24.252
MATT: Everyone all together, now. All together,
now!

00:44:24.252 --> 00:44:26.034
TALIESIN: (sings) All together, now.

00:44:26.034 --> 00:44:28.332
TRAVIS: Is he a giant? Like a giant?

00:44:28.332 --> 00:44:29.887
MATT: He's considered a giant.

00:44:29.887 --> 00:44:31.036
TRAVIS: I speak Giant!

00:44:31.036 --> 00:44:32.938
MARISHA: You speak Giant?!

00:44:32.938 --> 00:44:34.260
LAURA: Say something, Grog!

00:44:34.260 --> 00:44:35.275
TRAVIS: I speak Giant!

00:44:35.275 --> 00:44:36.242
ORION: Oh, good.

00:44:36.242 --> 00:44:38.123
TRAVIS: Oh, I can use my brain for something?

00:44:38.123 --> 00:44:46.787
MATT: All right, so we have 25 to 20? 25 to 20. 20
to 15.

00:44:46.787 --> 00:44:47.987
ORION: 18.

00:44:47.987 --> 00:44:49.061
ASHLEY: 18.

00:44:49.061 --> 00:44:49.901
LAURA: Yeah!

00:44:49.901 --> 00:44:51.046
TRAVIS: 17.

00:44:51.046 --> 00:44:52.041
LIAM: Cleric and the sorcerer.

00:44:52.041 --> 00:44:53.276
ORION: That close, Ash.

00:44:53.276 --> 00:44:54.521
ASHLEY: I don't like going first.

00:44:54.521 --> 00:44:56.380
ORION: That close to just spitting out all my
coffee.

00:44:56.380 --> 00:44:57.618
ASHLEY: I like picking up the pieces.

00:44:57.618 --> 00:44:58.880
MATT: 15 to ten.

00:44:58.880 --> 00:44:59.763
TALIESIN: 12.

00:44:59.763 --> 00:45:00.835
LIAM: 13.

00:45:00.835 --> 00:45:02.424
MATT: Okay.

00:45:02.424 --> 00:45:03.795
MARISHA AND TALIESIN: 12.

00:45:03.795 --> 00:45:11.940
MATT: All right, so Percy and Keyleth. All right,
so, ten to five. Ten to five?

00:45:11.940 --> 00:45:13.099
LIAM: Five.

00:45:13.099 --> 00:45:15.520
LAURA: Oh! That's me, I'm an eight.

00:45:15.520 --> 00:45:17.322
MATT: You're an eight, all right. We got Vex--

00:45:17.322 --> 00:45:18.910
LAURA: That's Trinket, too.

00:45:18.910 --> 00:45:21.611
MARISHA: He's so cuddly!

00:45:21.611 --> 00:45:25.319
MATT: All right, that is almost everyone. Who--

00:45:25.319 --> 00:45:26.750
SAM: One!

00:45:26.750 --> 00:45:32.031
MATT: One! Yeah, Scanlan! All right, Tiberius and
Pike, you're up first. As you guys rush on the

00:45:32.031 --> 00:45:38.476
scene, seeing this creature being currently
crushed by the semi-ethereal, giant arcane fist of

00:45:38.476 --> 00:45:42.769
Scanlan. Pike, Tiberius, what are you doing?

00:45:42.769 --> 00:45:43.979
ASHLEY: Go first.

00:45:43.979 --> 00:45:45.645
MARISHA: I don't want to see the giant fist of
Scanlan.

00:45:45.645 --> 00:45:47.042
SAM: Many have before.

00:45:47.042 --> 00:45:51.864
ORION: I'll follow suit, and be like: Oh, is this
what we're doing? Scanlan! What are we doing?

00:45:51.864 --> 00:45:55.616
SAM: We're capturing the giant, and don't remind
him I'm here.

00:45:55.616 --> 00:45:57.418
MARISHA: Capture!

00:45:57.418 --> 00:46:04.615
ORION: Oh, uh, very well. I'll Watery Sphere and
help him maintain him.

00:46:04.615 --> 00:46:08.018
MATT: Okay, so you're going to use your Aqua
Sphere?

00:46:08.018 --> 00:46:08.953
ORION: Yeah.

00:46:08.953 --> 00:46:11.125
MATT: All right, what is the effect on Huge
creatures?

00:46:11.125 --> 00:46:13.872
ORION: Like, it's a dope-ass effect.

00:46:13.872 --> 00:46:16.477
SAM: That's what it says in the book.

00:46:16.477 --> 00:46:17.954
MATT: What it officially says?

00:46:17.954 --> 00:46:20.533
ORION: Yep. Wizards of the Coast, page 304.

00:46:20.533 --> 00:46:21.669
SAM: What's the spell name?

00:46:21.669 --> 00:46:24.465
ORION AND MATT: Watery Sphere.

00:46:24.465 --> 00:46:31.226
MATT: Here we go, got it right here. A Huge or
larger creature automatically succeeds on the

00:46:31.226 --> 00:46:32.527
saving throw.

00:46:32.527 --> 00:46:33.449
SAM: Oh.

00:46:33.449 --> 00:46:39.110
MATT: So as you create the sphere around it, the
water forms around its physical form. It doesn't

00:46:39.110 --> 00:46:42.610
seem to be affecting it. It's large and strong
enough to the point where it's thrashing, because

00:46:42.610 --> 00:46:44.617
he's holding it in place, but the sphere is just
having no effect.

00:46:44.617 --> 00:46:46.948
LIAM: He smells slightly better than he did
before.

00:46:46.948 --> 00:46:50.594
MATT: He does. There are cleaner portions of his
flesh. This creature's a little larger than what

00:46:50.594 --> 00:46:52.401
you're used to capturing with a sphere.

00:46:52.401 --> 00:46:55.799
ORION: What are you talking about? How big is it?

00:46:55.799 --> 00:46:57.096
ALL: He's Huge!

00:46:57.096 --> 00:46:58.174
ASHLEY: Look how big he is!

00:46:58.174 --> 00:46:59.422
LAURA: Look at how big he is compared to us!

00:46:59.422 --> 00:47:01.983
MATT: This is an ogre!

00:47:01.983 --> 00:47:04.734
ORION: I can capture those, but not that guy.

00:47:04.734 --> 00:47:06.222
LIAM: Yes, you were tickling his nipples with your
water.

00:47:06.222 --> 00:47:07.280
MATT: Essentially.

00:47:07.280 --> 00:47:08.444
ASHLEY: He got a little bath.

00:47:08.444 --> 00:47:13.026
ORION: So, hold on. I knew that! I do that to wash
him off.

00:47:13.026 --> 00:47:14.932
LAURA: Okay, yeah. Because he's really stinky.

00:47:14.932 --> 00:47:16.345
MATT: He's much cleaner!

00:47:16.345 --> 00:47:19.809
ORION: And I'm swirling around, I'm like, does
this feel good, giant?

00:47:19.809 --> 00:47:22.964
MATT: (laughs) All right. Pike, what you got?

00:47:22.964 --> 00:47:27.482
ASHLEY: Okay. I'm going to make a Spiritual
Weapon.

00:47:27.482 --> 00:47:29.100
MATT: You what?

00:47:29.100 --> 00:47:30.525
ASHLEY: I'm going to make a Spiritual Weapon.

00:47:30.525 --> 00:47:31.450
MATT: Okay.

00:47:31.450 --> 00:47:37.229
ASHLEY: I want to make a lasso again, of sorts.
But with a grappling hook on the end. So it will

00:47:37.229 --> 00:47:39.640
spin around him real quick.

00:47:39.640 --> 00:47:40.690
SAM: A Lariat of Truth?

00:47:40.690 --> 00:47:42.787
ASHLEY: And keep him in place.

00:47:42.787 --> 00:47:46.418
MATT: Okay, all right, so you're creating a
Spiritual Weapon. We'll say this can be considered

00:47:46.418 --> 00:47:47.823
just an additional grapple.

00:47:47.823 --> 00:47:48.955
ASHLEY: Okay.

00:47:48.955 --> 00:47:53.489
MATT: All right. Good to know. So you create it.
I'll just use this as the Spiritual Weapon, in his

00:47:53.489 --> 00:47:59.931
space, currently. It begins to wrap around him
rapidly. One, two, three, four. And finds purchase

00:47:59.931 --> 00:48:03.041
on its own self, holding it in place. So, there we
go.

00:48:03.041 --> 00:48:04.334
SAM: Double grapple!

00:48:04.334 --> 00:48:06.422
MATT: Do you want to move with your turn, or you
want to stay there?

00:48:06.422 --> 00:48:07.634
ASHLEY: Where am I at?

00:48:07.634 --> 00:48:08.696
MATT: You're right here.

00:48:08.696 --> 00:48:11.062
ASHLEY: Okay. Yeah, I want to get a little
closer.

00:48:11.062 --> 00:48:13.342
LAURA: Whoa, whoa!

00:48:13.342 --> 00:48:14.950
ASHLEY: Just hold on a minute, I want to-- Yeah.

00:48:14.950 --> 00:48:16.527
SAM: She's getting closer to me.

00:48:16.527 --> 00:48:19.183
LIAM: The gnomes are like tent spikes, holding him
in place.

00:48:19.183 --> 00:48:24.337
MATT: As a note, real fast, guys. Let's see if we
have the--

00:48:24.337 --> 00:48:26.105
ORION: Currently washing his hump.

00:48:26.105 --> 00:48:28.337
LIAM: Oh my god, is the beholder attacking? Is it
now?

00:48:28.337 --> 00:48:33.191
MATT: No, I want to make sure we have the laser
pointers for you guys. Everyone forgets those.

00:48:33.191 --> 00:48:35.979
MARISHA: Oh, do we have more? I've got one right
here.

00:48:35.979 --> 00:48:40.813
MATT: All right. I have one, here.

00:48:40.813 --> 00:48:43.105
MARISHA: Throw it to that table.

00:48:43.105 --> 00:48:44.699
MATT: All right, so we have two over there?

00:48:44.699 --> 00:48:46.215
TALIESIN: We've got one over here. Two over here.

00:48:46.215 --> 00:48:48.105
MARISHA AND ORION: Three over here.

00:48:48.105 --> 00:48:50.037
MATT: All righty. Good to know. Thank you for your
patience.

00:48:50.037 --> 00:48:56.419
ASHLEY: Do I roll for damage or anything like
that? Or, since it's a grappling--

00:48:56.419 --> 00:48:59.028
MATT: For the purpose of what you want to do with
this grappling hook, it's not going to do any

00:48:59.028 --> 00:49:01.524
damage to him. It's just going to be an additional
grapple to him, holding him in place.

00:49:01.524 --> 00:49:02.737
ASHLEY: Okay.

00:49:02.737 --> 00:49:04.323
MATT: All right. That brings us to Grog.

00:49:04.323 --> 00:49:10.018
TRAVIS: I hold off on Raging. I can't talk, right?
If I'm freaking out?

00:49:10.018 --> 00:49:11.357
SAM: You're going to talk?

00:49:11.357 --> 00:49:16.855
MATT: You can talk but it comes through in single
words, and usually not in a diplomatic way.

00:49:16.855 --> 00:49:27.696
TRAVIS: Right. So I call out in Giant, "Nipple
Taint, Knuckle Broom!" which means, "Brother! We

00:49:27.696 --> 00:49:37.194
"seek to fight a great evil! Perchance, would thou
carest to join us in such a fight? I have ale."

00:49:37.194 --> 00:49:38.762
ASHLEY: Inspiration? Anybody can--

00:49:38.762 --> 00:49:40.331
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah. Would you like to join us?

00:49:40.331 --> 00:49:42.515
MARISHA: Whose turn is next?

00:49:42.515 --> 00:49:45.704
MATT: Grog. Next after this is Vax.

00:49:45.704 --> 00:49:47.460
SAM: You're just appealing to his reason?

00:49:47.460 --> 00:49:49.442
MARISHA: Can I go next? And help him out?

00:49:49.442 --> 00:49:52.593
MATT: It's a little late for that, unfortunately.
He's ahead of you.

00:49:52.593 --> 00:49:59.344
TRAVIS: We're not worth the trouble. But we would
love to pay you in ale to join us on

00:49:59.344 --> 00:50:02.471
a much better fight.

00:50:02.471 --> 00:50:08.608
MATT: Go ahead and make a persuasion roll with
disadvantage.

00:50:08.608 --> 00:50:12.438
TRAVIS: That's pretty bad. That's the same
number.

00:50:12.438 --> 00:50:15.950
(laughter)

00:50:15.950 --> 00:50:21.540
TRAVIS: I get a massive plus one. Five.

00:50:21.540 --> 00:50:23.964
LAURA: Oh. It worked! I think it worked!

00:50:23.964 --> 00:50:31.955
MATT: So, the bound, twisted, malformed, giant
creature that's currently held by ethereal rope

00:50:31.955 --> 00:50:37.606
and ethereal hand, glances over at you for a
second. And you swear, you hear a chuckle.

00:50:37.606 --> 00:50:45.576
(chuckles) And spits a basketball-sized loogie
onto the ground in front of you.

00:50:45.576 --> 00:50:46.592
LAURA: So disgusting.

00:50:46.592 --> 00:50:48.956
TRAVIS: Impressive. Fuck it. I rage!

00:50:48.956 --> 00:50:51.341
(laughter)

00:50:51.341 --> 00:50:52.979
TRAVIS: And I attack.

00:50:52.979 --> 00:50:55.569
MATT: I would say that diplomatic attempt on him
would be your action.

00:50:55.569 --> 00:50:58.021
TRAVIS: Son of a bitch. Can I rage as a bonus
action?

00:50:58.021 --> 00:50:59.580
MATT: You would be raging as a bonus action.

00:50:59.580 --> 00:51:01.206
TRAVIS: (incoherent rage shouting)

00:51:01.206 --> 00:51:03.791
MATT: Okay, do you want to move as well?

00:51:03.791 --> 00:51:06.318
LIAM: Look how little you look, next to him.
You're so small.

00:51:06.318 --> 00:51:08.673
TRAVIS: I know, I'm right at testicle height.

00:51:08.673 --> 00:51:10.313
LIAM: Yeah.

00:51:10.313 --> 00:51:15.694
TRAVIS: Which is not good. No, I'll stay right
where I am.

00:51:15.694 --> 00:51:18.056
MATT: All right. That gets us to Vax.

00:51:18.056 --> 00:51:24.787
LIAM: I'm going to go stealth. And then, this
ring. This is a wall, right?

00:51:24.787 --> 00:51:27.544
MATT: It's a big 15-foot wall that goes down into
this pit.

00:51:27.544 --> 00:51:29.952
LIAM: So, going stealth, is that a bonus action?

00:51:29.952 --> 00:51:35.801
MATT: Going stealth, for this, I would say, would
be considered part of your move. It's a

00:51:35.801 --> 00:51:38.386
disadvantage if you're stealthing while moving.

00:51:38.386 --> 00:51:44.706
LIAM: Okay. Well, I still want to do that. So I'm
going to try to scurry over the wall there,

00:51:44.706 --> 00:51:46.103
and go stealth.

00:51:46.103 --> 00:51:50.021
MATT: Actually, for you, isn't Hide the stealth
ability that you can use as a bonus action?

00:51:50.021 --> 00:51:51.708
LIAM: Yeah, it's part of the cunning actions.

00:51:51.708 --> 00:51:53.069
MATT: So that would be it, yes.

00:51:53.069 --> 00:51:54.128
LIAM: All right.

00:51:54.128 --> 00:51:55.495
MATT: It would be your bonus action to attempt to
stealth, yes.

00:51:55.495 --> 00:51:57.761
LIAM: Okay, so roll to stealth, right?

00:51:57.761 --> 00:51:58.791
MATT: Yeah, go for it.

00:51:58.791 --> 00:52:00.959
LIAM: Come on, meteorite die. I'm using Luck,
because that was terrible.

00:52:00.959 --> 00:52:02.257
That was still terrible!

00:52:02.257 --> 00:52:03.285
MATT: That's two Luck points.

00:52:03.285 --> 00:52:07.044
LIAM: Okay, all right. I'm not stealthed, but I
run over by--

00:52:07.044 --> 00:52:09.497
MATT: What did you roll? You don't know if you're
stealthed or not.

00:52:09.497 --> 00:52:14.250
LIAM: Oh. Five and a-- Oh, sorry. It was so
pitiful. 16 and--

00:52:14.250 --> 00:52:16.103
LAURA: That's not pitiful!

00:52:16.103 --> 00:52:20.463
LIAM: It is for me. 16 and 18.

00:52:20.463 --> 00:52:23.786
MATT: All right. 16 and an 18. Gotcha. All right,
cool. So we have an 18 stealth, technically.

00:52:23.786 --> 00:52:25.242
(sarcastically) So pitiful.

00:52:25.242 --> 00:52:29.234
ASHLEY: Yeah, you want to talk pitiful for
stealth?

00:52:29.234 --> 00:52:31.466
MATT: As far as you know, you may or may not be
hidden. What are you doing?

00:52:31.466 --> 00:52:36.205
LIAM: All right, I want to roll over the side of
the wall, and then just move along over by

00:52:36.205 --> 00:52:39.960
Scanlan. Between Scanlan and the giant, and just
hold my attack.

00:52:39.960 --> 00:52:41.790
MATT: Okay.

00:52:41.790 --> 00:52:44.530
LIAM: I can trigger that down the road, right?

00:52:44.530 --> 00:52:45.338
MATT: Yeah.

00:52:45.338 --> 00:52:46.348
LIAM: Okay.

00:52:46.348 --> 00:52:50.950
MATT: You wouldn't be able to wait. You'd have to
wait until next turn. You can't hold part of your

00:52:50.950 --> 00:52:52.128
turn, you've already taken--

00:52:52.128 --> 00:52:53.770
LIAM: Then I'm going to stab him in the knee

00:52:53.770 --> 00:52:58.514
MATT: Okay, so are you shimmying along the side?
He's 15 feet above you. You're down 15 feet. You

00:52:58.514 --> 00:53:00.234
would have to throw a dagger to hit him at this
point.

00:53:00.234 --> 00:53:02.103
LIAM: All right, I'll throw it in his face.

00:53:02.103 --> 00:53:08.953
MATT: Okay. Currently bound, kind of easy to see.
He's really ugly. You throw a dagger up towards

00:53:08.953 --> 00:53:10.473
him with your action.

00:53:10.473 --> 00:53:12.706
LIAM: All right, that's no good. And then the
bonus action is also no good.

00:53:12.706 --> 00:53:14.462
MATT: You've already used your bonus action to go
stealth.

00:53:14.462 --> 00:53:15.694
LIAM: Well, they're gone.

00:53:15.694 --> 00:53:16.699
MATT: What'd you roll?

00:53:16.699 --> 00:53:17.883
LIAM: Four and a five.

00:53:17.883 --> 00:53:18.955
MATT: Plus--

00:53:18.955 --> 00:53:21.621
LIAM: Plus-- I didn't sleep at all last night.

00:53:21.621 --> 00:53:23.611
MATT: Tell me what your final numbers are!

00:53:23.611 --> 00:53:26.096
LIAM: 12 and ten.

00:53:26.096 --> 00:53:30.020
MATT: Okay, yeah. Both of those, unfortunately
miss. You fling both. Unfortunately, the process

00:53:30.020 --> 00:53:34.321
of jumping down and running, as you chuck it at
the end of your movement next to Scanlan, even

00:53:34.321 --> 00:53:38.968
though he's bound, you're just a little off your
game. It just cascades out of sight and then

00:53:38.968 --> 00:53:43.961
vanishes, appearing back on your belt. That brings
us to Percy and Keyleth.

00:53:43.961 --> 00:53:47.183
TALIESIN: I'll go first. Okay, I'm going to--
Where am I?

00:53:47.183 --> 00:53:48.711
MATT: You're over here.

00:53:48.711 --> 00:53:55.356
TALIESIN: Okay, I'm going to scoot in over here
and make my way. And as I'm running by, I'm going

00:53:55.356 --> 00:53:58.954
to take a shot at his kneecap and see if I can
prone him.

00:53:58.954 --> 00:54:00.017
MATT: Okay.

00:54:00.017 --> 00:54:01.287
ASHLEY: Come on, Bad News.

00:54:01.287 --> 00:54:02.538
MARISHA: Are we still trying to capture him?

00:54:02.538 --> 00:54:03.877
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm just going to knock him down.

00:54:03.877 --> 00:54:05.608
LAURA: I think we're trying.

00:54:05.608 --> 00:54:08.251
ORION: You can do non-lethal damage to him.

00:54:08.251 --> 00:54:09.186
TALIESIN: 20?

00:54:09.186 --> 00:54:10.586
MATT: 20 hits.

00:54:10.586 --> 00:54:11.551
TALIESIN: 20 hits.

00:54:11.551 --> 00:54:13.112
ASHLEY: And he's grappled?

00:54:13.112 --> 00:54:14.192
SAM: Twice.

00:54:14.192 --> 00:54:17.748
TALIESIN: He's grappled and he's now prone. But
I'm going to do my 1d10 damage.

00:54:17.748 --> 00:54:21.045
ASHLEY: He's double grappled. Shit, I forgot that
he was already grappled.

00:54:21.045 --> 00:54:22.215
TRAVIS: Can I try to talk to him?

00:54:22.215 --> 00:54:24.031
TALIESIN: That's 15 damage.

00:54:24.031 --> 00:54:25.303
MATT: Okay.

00:54:25.303 --> 00:54:26.777
TALIESIN: He takes 15 damage and he's prone.

00:54:26.777 --> 00:54:29.069
LIAM: Sweet.

00:54:29.069 --> 00:54:31.727
MATT: "Arrgh!" (heavy impact)

00:54:31.727 --> 00:54:33.249
SAM: Don't fall on me!

00:54:33.249 --> 00:54:35.358
TALIESIN: And I'm going to finish scooting down
there.

00:54:35.358 --> 00:54:42.133
MATT: I will-- (laughs) Okay, so, as you shoot off
the kneecap, he tumbles forward.

00:54:42.133 --> 00:54:44.091
LAURA: Oh no!

00:54:44.091 --> 00:54:49.645
MATT: Over the edge. This way. Both of you guys
make dexterity saving throws.

00:54:49.645 --> 00:54:51.693
TALIESIN: We can't win!

00:54:51.693 --> 00:54:53.267
ASHLEY: Wait, that's a cliff?

00:54:53.267 --> 00:54:55.803
LAURA: That's an edge, with a 15-foot drop.

00:54:55.803 --> 00:54:57.663
MATT: It's a 50-50 shot on which side he fell.

00:54:57.663 --> 00:54:58.670
SAM: Where's my dice?

00:54:58.670 --> 00:54:59.957
TALIESIN: I spent a Grit point for that.

00:54:59.957 --> 00:55:01.044
SAM: Where's my 20?

00:55:01.044 --> 00:55:02.272
TALIESIN: Here.

00:55:02.272 --> 00:55:03.237
SAM: Oh, here it is.

00:55:03.237 --> 00:55:04.470
ASHLEY: 15, or five-zero?

00:55:04.470 --> 00:55:05.422
LAURA: 15.

00:55:05.422 --> 00:55:06.470
LIAM: 19.

00:55:06.470 --> 00:55:07.543
SAM: Plus what?

00:55:07.543 --> 00:55:09.070
MATT: Your dexterity saving throw.

00:55:09.070 --> 00:55:09.955
SAM: 17.

00:55:09.955 --> 00:55:10.878
MATT: 17.

00:55:10.878 --> 00:55:15.171
MATT: You both manage to just leap out of the way.
Slamming onto his back on the ground.

00:55:15.171 --> 00:55:17.885
SAM: Do we get free attacks on him?

00:55:17.885 --> 00:55:19.251
(laughter)

00:55:19.251 --> 00:55:22.175
MATT: No, but you're nearly crushed by an
extremely large person.

00:55:22.175 --> 00:55:23.676
SAM: I'll take it. That's a plus, that's a
positive.

00:55:23.676 --> 00:55:26.107
MATT: All right, Percy, does that end your turn?

00:55:26.107 --> 00:55:29.721
TALIESIN: I'm not doing anything else for this
turn. That went poorly.

00:55:29.721 --> 00:55:30.888
MATT: Okay, Keyleth.

00:55:30.888 --> 00:55:43.338
MARISHA: Okay, I'm going to-- Can I move, can I
get to him?

00:55:43.338 --> 00:55:49.119
MATT: He's 15 feet down. You can move up to the
edge, here. Look down and see him on the ground,

00:55:49.119 --> 00:55:52.262
currently restrained and struggling on his back.

00:55:52.262 --> 00:55:59.874
MARISHA: If I turn into a snake, can I get down
there? Big snake?

00:55:59.874 --> 00:56:01.535
(laughter)

00:56:01.535 --> 00:56:03.173
MATT: I'd say you would be able to.

00:56:03.173 --> 00:56:06.595
MARISHA: I want to turn into a giant constrictor.

00:56:06.595 --> 00:56:08.016
MATT: Okay.

00:56:08.016 --> 00:56:11.318
LAURA: You're going to constrict him?

00:56:11.318 --> 00:56:15.436
MARISHA: Real big snake! Yeah, I'm going to
constrict him.

00:56:15.436 --> 00:56:18.509
MATT: (sings) I'll use this naga figure for that.

00:56:18.509 --> 00:56:19.900
ALL: Ooh.

00:56:19.900 --> 00:56:21.193
LAURA: That's big.

00:56:21.193 --> 00:56:22.626
MARISHA: I'm a naga!

00:56:22.626 --> 00:56:24.763
SAM: We are grappling the hell out of him.

00:56:24.763 --> 00:56:26.353
MARISHA: I'm so pretty.

00:56:26.353 --> 00:56:28.468
MATT: Leap down? And you're trying to grapple
him?

00:56:28.468 --> 00:56:30.219
MARISHA: And I'm going to start constricting.

00:56:30.219 --> 00:56:32.976
SAM: Grog, you might have to talk to him again.

00:56:32.976 --> 00:56:35.462
MATT: All right, so go ahead and roll a d20.

00:56:35.462 --> 00:56:37.198
TRAVIS: I don't know if I can.

00:56:37.198 --> 00:56:39.692
MATT: What's the strength bonus of the form?

00:56:39.692 --> 00:56:42.272
MARISHA: I get a plus six. Oh wait.

00:56:42.272 --> 00:56:44.865
MATT: What's it say for the constricting? It
should have the rule there for it.

00:56:44.865 --> 00:56:49.191
MARISHA: It's a strength--

00:56:49.191 --> 00:56:51.950
MATT: All right, so you add six to that.

00:56:52.209 --> 00:56:57.050
MARISHA: -- bonus, I guess. So 14.

00:56:57.050 --> 00:57:01.257
MATT: Okay. You start moving around and even
though he's still struggling in his form, he gets

00:57:01.257 --> 00:57:05.572
one hand up and is holding you at bay. You have
not managed to grapple him yet, but you are in the

00:57:05.572 --> 00:57:09.950
process of trying to. Next round you can try
again. He's pretty strong.

00:57:09.950 --> 00:57:12.362
LIAM: When are you clever folk going to get in his
head?

00:57:12.362 --> 00:57:13.432
MATT: Vex.

00:57:13.432 --> 00:57:14.366
LAURA: That's me.

00:57:14.366 --> 00:57:15.314
MATT: Yep.

00:57:15.314 --> 00:57:23.357
LAURA: I am going to-- Has he taken a lot of
damage yet, or are we just keep grappling him?

00:57:23.357 --> 00:57:26.614
MATT: He looks-- There's been a lot of grappling
this past round. He took a lot of damage before

00:57:26.614 --> 00:57:28.830
everyone else showed up and it's been just a lot
of holding him.

00:57:28.830 --> 00:57:31.876
LAURA: All right, I'm going to attack him, twice.
The second time with a--

00:57:31.876 --> 00:57:33.520
MATT: You can't see him right now, because he's
fallen.

00:57:33.520 --> 00:57:35.005
LAURA: I'm going to scootch up there so I can.

00:57:35.005 --> 00:57:37.345
MATT: All right.

00:57:37.345 --> 00:57:38.526
SAM: Just hold him.

00:57:38.526 --> 00:57:40.125
MATT: And now you see him on the ground.

00:57:40.125 --> 00:57:41.852
LAURA: And I'm going to take two shots at him.

00:57:41.852 --> 00:57:47.546
MATT: All right. Both of these shots are at
disadvantage, because there's Keyleth currently

00:57:47.546 --> 00:57:49.402
trying to wrap around him as a giant snake.

00:57:49.402 --> 00:57:56.553
LAURA: All right.

00:57:56.553 --> 00:57:58.188
TRAVIS: She'll be fine!

00:57:58.188 --> 00:58:00.357
MARISHA: I thought we were trying to capture him.

00:58:00.357 --> 00:58:02.805
ORION: We are. She can knock him out, though.

00:58:02.805 --> 00:58:04.675
MATT: So just each attack with disadvantage.

00:58:04.675 --> 00:58:05.945
TRAVIS: Just roll really high both times.

00:58:05.945 --> 00:58:06.712
LIAM: Wow!

00:58:06.712 --> 00:58:09.199
LAURA: 24, 26!

00:58:09.199 --> 00:58:10.441
MATT: That hits. Second attack.

00:58:10.441 --> 00:58:13.634
LAURA: Second attack is a Sleep arrow.

00:58:13.634 --> 00:58:15.251
MATT: Secondary Sleep arrow.

00:58:15.251 --> 00:58:16.191
LAURA: Yeah.

00:58:16.191 --> 00:58:17.116
MATT: All right.

00:58:17.116 --> 00:58:18.044
MARISHA: Go to sleep!

00:58:18.044 --> 00:58:19.917
MATT: Go to sleep, go to sleep, go to sleep!

00:58:19.917 --> 00:58:21.116
LAURA: 17.

00:58:21.116 --> 00:58:25.110
MATT: 17 also hits. All right, so go ahead and
roll damage on the first arrow, with your Hunter's

00:58:25.110 --> 00:58:26.134
Mark damage.

00:58:26.134 --> 00:58:30.869
LAURA: Yes. 15, 16, 17, 20?

00:58:30.869 --> 00:58:32.112
MATT: All right.

00:58:32.112 --> 00:58:34.136
LAURA: And then the second one--

00:58:34.136 --> 00:58:35.291
TRAVIS: You're putting the hurt on him.

00:58:35.291 --> 00:58:42.125
LAURA: That's ten, 11, 12. 16 on the second hit.

00:58:42.125 --> 00:58:44.353
MATT: 16, okay. And then go ahead and roll 5d8 for
the Sleep arrow.

00:58:44.353 --> 00:58:45.734
LAURA: Oh, right, I only get 5d8.

00:58:45.734 --> 00:58:47.177
MATT: Yeah, wasn't a critical hit, sorry.

00:58:47.177 --> 00:58:59.805
LAURA: Oh. Okay. Look at all these dice I have!
14, 20, 22?

00:58:59.805 --> 00:59:07.093
MATT: 22? As the arrow sinks into him, you see him
struggling against both the snake form and Bigby's

00:59:07.093 --> 00:59:12.793
Grasping Hand. As it struggles and throws about,
the grappling hook tightens on its form--

00:59:12.793 --> 00:59:16.557
TRAVIS: Oh, oh!

00:59:16.557 --> 00:59:17.565
LAURA: Yes!

00:59:17.565 --> 00:59:18.616
TRAVIS and LAURA: Sleep!

00:59:18.616 --> 00:59:20.771
(cheering)

00:59:20.771 --> 00:59:22.096
SAM: How did you do it?

00:59:22.096 --> 00:59:23.403
ASHLEY: She has a Sleep arrow.

00:59:23.403 --> 00:59:24.358
SAM: You had another one?

00:59:24.358 --> 00:59:25.509
LAURA: Yeah, I have three.

00:59:25.509 --> 00:59:26.892
MATT: Now she has one.

00:59:26.892 --> 00:59:28.024
LAURA: Now I have one!

00:59:28.024 --> 00:59:29.046
SAM: (whispers) Okay, he's asleep.

00:59:29.046 --> 00:59:30.741
SAM: (whispers) Shh, everyone whisper.

00:59:30.741 --> 00:59:31.914
TRAVIS: (normal volume) What?

00:59:31.914 --> 00:59:33.095
LAURA: Shh.

00:59:33.095 --> 00:59:34.568
LIAM: (whispers) Rock him, Keyleth. Rock him.

00:59:34.568 --> 00:59:36.292
LAURA: No, don't wake him up. Don't rock him.

00:59:36.292 --> 00:59:40.550
MATT: So, for the moment, combat is paused. You
guys do what you need to, but be aware that every

00:59:40.550 --> 00:59:42.344
period of time, he's going to be making saving
throws.

00:59:42.344 --> 00:59:44.356
SAM: Okay, we have a mind flayer.

00:59:44.356 --> 00:59:47.874
LAURA: Oh, Clarota, can you Dominate him?

00:59:47.874 --> 00:59:49.675
SAM: Yeah, Clarota is a mind flayer, it's his
bag.

00:59:49.675 --> 01:00:05.426
MATT: Clarota steps forward and goes, "I can, for
a short period of time, or I could just take its mind."

01:00:05.426 --> 01:00:06.590
LAURA: Okay, yeah.

01:00:06.590 --> 01:00:09.111
(sounds of protest)

01:00:09.111 --> 01:00:11.606
ORION: You mean for a snack, though, you're
saying.

01:00:11.606 --> 01:00:16.988
MATT: "I would then have its memories and
knowledge at my disposal."

01:00:16.988 --> 01:00:18.873
LAURA: But you can't control its body?

01:00:18.873 --> 01:00:21.717
ORION: We need more of his brutish, tank-ish
strength.

01:00:21.717 --> 01:00:23.166
TRAVIS: What was your thing?

01:00:23.166 --> 01:00:24.980
ASHLEY: Wait, so short time means what?

01:00:24.980 --> 01:00:30.418
MATT: "Until it resists the influence."

01:00:30.418 --> 01:00:32.046
SAM: Until it resists, that's no good.

01:00:32.046 --> 01:00:33.335
LIAM: That's very temporary.

01:00:33.335 --> 01:00:35.637
ORION: Could you perhaps put him to sleep for the
evening?

01:00:35.637 --> 01:00:40.617
MARISHA: Or can we figure out a way to restrain
him?

01:00:40.617 --> 01:00:41.984
SAM: We need to rest.

01:00:41.984 --> 01:00:44.258
LAURA: Yeah, can we quickly tie him down while
we're talking?

01:00:44.258 --> 01:00:48.885
MARISHA: Because here's the thing, I have an
ability where I can use Geas. And cast Geas on

01:00:48.885 --> 01:00:53.863
him, and I basically give him a command and he'll
essentially become our big--

01:00:53.863 --> 01:00:55.117
SAM: And it lasts for 30 days.

01:00:55.117 --> 01:00:56.982
MARISHA: He'll be our big, beefy minion for 30
days.

01:00:56.982 --> 01:00:57.914
LAURA: Oh, yeah!

01:00:57.914 --> 01:01:00.309
MARISHA: And if he resists it, he takes psychic
damage.

01:01:00.309 --> 01:01:02.816
TRAVIS: We have have manacles, and we have
chains.

01:01:02.816 --> 01:01:04.627
SAM: Put him in the Bag of Holding!

01:01:04.627 --> 01:01:07.691
LAURA: Let's frickin' tie him down. At least can
we tie him up right now?

01:01:07.691 --> 01:01:12.354
ORION: We'll secure him, but Clarota, could you
prolong the Sleep spell for eight hours so we can

01:01:12.354 --> 01:01:14.105
rest and you could do your spell?

01:01:14.105 --> 01:01:22.845
MATT: "For eight hours, no. Nothing in my
repertoire lasts that long, which is why I say let

01:01:22.845 --> 01:01:25.296
"me take his mind."

01:01:25.296 --> 01:01:26.225
MARISHA: No.

01:01:26.225 --> 01:01:27.848
TRAVIS: I don't wanna!

01:01:27.848 --> 01:01:31.839
LAURA: It's a big ol' feast, I know, I know. It's
a lot of food for you.

01:01:31.839 --> 01:01:33.869
MATT: "I'm hungry."

01:01:33.869 --> 01:01:36.715
MARISHA: You had a snack not that long ago.

01:01:36.715 --> 01:01:40.008
ORION: I hand him some jerky. It's really
delicious.

01:01:40.008 --> 01:01:45.778
LAURA: Clarota, what about the thing he was
carrying? Can you eat that thing's brain?

01:01:45.778 --> 01:01:47.834
SAM: Don't worry about his dinner right now.

01:01:47.834 --> 01:01:49.457
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, what was he dragging? Wasn't
there a corpse?

01:01:49.457 --> 01:01:52.035
SAM: Let's figure out how we're going to control
it.

01:01:52.035 --> 01:01:53.308
TRAVIS: I don't think we can.

01:01:53.308 --> 01:01:55.289
SAM: Okay, let's manacle it. Let's at least try to
hold it.

01:01:55.289 --> 01:01:56.544
LAURA: Chain it up.

01:01:56.544 --> 01:01:57.634
SAM: Chain it up.

01:01:57.634 --> 01:01:59.756
TRAVIS: Can you make the manacles big? Can you
Engorge the--

01:01:59.756 --> 01:02:05.366
MATT: The creature begins to flutter its eyes for
a second. Clarota immediately looks down and puts

01:02:05.366 --> 01:02:09.689
his hand out and releases a force of arcane
sparkles that cover its body,

01:02:09.689 --> 01:02:12.734
and it falls back asleep.

01:02:12.734 --> 01:02:14.992
TRAVIS: Can you make the manacles bigger?
Giant-sized?

01:02:14.992 --> 01:02:18.724
SAM: No, they're inorganic. I can't do anything to
those.

01:02:18.724 --> 01:02:20.747
LAURA: Can we just use chain and tie him up?

01:02:20.747 --> 01:02:22.606
TRAVIS: Like Harry Potter! Engorgio! No?

01:02:22.606 --> 01:02:23.719
ORION: Engorgio?

01:02:23.719 --> 01:02:24.743
TRAVIS: Fuck!

01:02:24.743 --> 01:02:25.872
TALIESIN: Do we have chain?

01:02:25.872 --> 01:02:27.207
LAURA: We have chain. Grog has chain.

01:02:27.207 --> 01:02:28.370
TALIESIN: Let's chain him up.

01:02:28.370 --> 01:02:29.474
LAURA: We chain him up!

01:02:29.474 --> 01:02:32.286
SAM: I have poison. I have drow poison from a
previous adventure.

01:02:32.286 --> 01:02:35.583
That's a knockout drug, isn't it?

01:02:35.583 --> 01:02:37.616
MATT: You don't know much about drow poison.

01:02:37.616 --> 01:02:38.679
SAM: Damn it!

01:02:38.679 --> 01:02:40.627
MATT: Go ahead and make a nature roll.

01:02:40.627 --> 01:02:44.137
LAURA: Percy and I chain him up. We use the chains
that we have.

01:02:44.137 --> 01:02:45.264
SAM: 20.

01:02:45.264 --> 01:02:52.002
MATT: 20? You know that drow poison, for the most
part, would not facilitate keeping something alive.

01:02:52.002 --> 01:02:55.271
ORION: Right, it is poisonous.

01:02:55.271 --> 01:03:01.811
LIAM: While everybody's discussing, Vax is going
to walk down to the center of the pit to take a

01:03:01.811 --> 01:03:03.206
peek at that hole.

01:03:03.206 --> 01:03:08.163
MATT: Okay. You go ahead and glance over the top.
It drops down about 20 feet in what looks to be a

01:03:08.163 --> 01:03:13.985
series of long rusted-over, metallic spikes.
Whatever this pit was previously used for was

01:03:14.207 --> 01:03:18.171
almost like a gladiatorial experience. You can see
what looks like some clusters of old, ancient

01:03:18.171 --> 01:03:21.869
bones at the bottom. Mostly seen disuse for
hundreds of years.

01:03:21.869 --> 01:03:26.070
TRAVIS: We should drag him over there, just in
case he wakes up. Kick him in.

01:03:26.070 --> 01:03:29.488
ORION: It's fine. If he did something, we'd kill
him.

01:03:29.488 --> 01:03:31.280
MATT: So what are you guys doing?

01:03:31.280 --> 01:03:33.272
SAM: You don't have the spell, right?

01:03:33.272 --> 01:03:40.706
MARISHA: Can I take time, if we grapple him and I
take a rest, essentially, almost take a 20 to cast

01:03:40.706 --> 01:03:41.919
Geas on him?

01:03:41.919 --> 01:03:45.199
MATT: How long does Geas take to cast?

01:03:45.199 --> 01:03:46.877
ORION: It's a minute to cast.

01:03:46.877 --> 01:03:48.088
MARISHA: Generally takes a minute to cast.

01:03:48.088 --> 01:03:49.525
MATT: Okay.

01:03:49.525 --> 01:03:50.601
MARISHA: Can I do that?

01:03:50.601 --> 01:03:53.496
MATT: You can certainly try. We'll see how long
you guys can keep him restrained.

01:03:53.496 --> 01:03:54.585
TALIESIN: We have chained him.

01:03:54.585 --> 01:03:55.658
LAURA: We have chained him.

01:03:55.658 --> 01:03:56.631
MATT: Right.

01:03:56.631 --> 01:03:58.018
SAM: With our puny chains.

01:03:58.018 --> 01:04:01.873
MATT: As you guys are getting the chains around
him, he maintains his slumber. You guys continue

01:04:01.873 --> 01:04:05.659
to bring the chains around. It's a big body and
there's a lot to get around. How much chain do you

01:04:05.659 --> 01:04:07.452
guys have total, by the way, length-wise?

01:04:07.452 --> 01:04:08.498
TRAVIS: It's 150 feet.

01:04:08.498 --> 01:04:09.773
MATT: 150 feet of chain.

01:04:09.773 --> 01:04:11.392
SAM: We also have our never-ending rope, don't
we?

01:04:11.392 --> 01:04:15.019
LAURA: I know, we do have some more never-ending
rope. And we can keep using that. A lot of it.

01:04:15.019 --> 01:04:17.154
TALIESIN: Never-ending rope doesn't grow on trees,
though.

01:04:17.154 --> 01:04:20.869
MATT: Okay. You get the chain-- full length of
chain around his torso area. You start getting it

01:04:20.869 --> 01:04:24.027
around his legs, you start pulling the rope
around. He begins to wake up once again. He begins

01:04:24.027 --> 01:04:25.132
to thrash about.

01:04:25.132 --> 01:04:26.420
LAURA: No, no, no.

01:04:26.420 --> 01:04:32.774
MATT: He rolls a two to break against the chain.
He's currently still grappled. Clarota releases

01:04:32.774 --> 01:04:34.709
another Sleep spell.

01:04:34.709 --> 01:04:40.269
TRAVIS: Should we put a fancy robe over his nasty
eye, so he can't give you the--

01:04:40.269 --> 01:04:41.340
LAURA: Yeah, let's do it.

01:04:41.340 --> 01:04:42.510
SAM: Sure, yeah, why not?

01:04:42.510 --> 01:04:47.268
TRAVIS: We have eight fancy robes. I take one of
them and I put it over his nasty pirate eye.

01:04:47.268 --> 01:04:52.023
MATT: Okay. You take one of your eight fancy robes
you had kicking in the Bag of Holding.

01:04:52.023 --> 01:04:56.682
TRAVIS: They were in the closet, nobody wanted
them! But now they're coming to use, so suck it up.

01:04:56.682 --> 01:04:58.193
ORION: Let me sleep, hold on.

01:04:58.193 --> 01:05:02.863
MATT: It is probably the nicest thing this
creature has ever worn. Just keep that in mind.

01:05:02.863 --> 01:05:04.930
LIAM: There's a pair of pants hanging off his
eye.

01:05:04.930 --> 01:05:10.431
MATT: You finish restraining him with the chains.
Who's doing what?

01:05:10.431 --> 01:05:12.077
SAM: She's just casting, right?

01:05:12.077 --> 01:05:13.514
MARISHA: I guess you can help me out?

01:05:13.514 --> 01:05:15.335
SAM: I'm going to inspire her, somehow.

01:05:15.335 --> 01:05:17.942
ORION: I'm going to encourage success.

01:05:17.942 --> 01:05:21.269
SAM: I'm going to inspire her with a song.

01:05:21.269 --> 01:05:24.017
LIAM: I'm going to see if I see anything more than
just spikes down in the hole.

01:05:24.017 --> 01:05:25.339
MATT: Perception check.

01:05:25.339 --> 01:05:29.305
LAURA: Keyleth-- Oh, never mind. Can anybody make
it look like there's a big feast in front of him?

01:05:29.305 --> 01:05:30.503
LIAM: 24.

01:05:30.503 --> 01:05:35.951
MATT: 24? You do see what looks like some sort of
mild glimmer of metal that amongst all the rest of

01:05:35.951 --> 01:05:40.237
the weapons and armor that have been destroyed
down there, one seems to have resisted the age,

01:05:40.237 --> 01:05:41.700
that has stayed.

01:05:41.700 --> 01:05:45.280
LIAM: I have a plain old 50-foot rope. I'm going
to try to tie it to something on the edge.

01:05:45.280 --> 01:05:49.259
MATT: There is nothing to find purchase for, here.
It's just a pit.

01:05:49.259 --> 01:05:51.241
LAURA: Let's do it!

01:05:51.241 --> 01:05:54.781
TRAVIS: While they're chaining him up and
everything, I'd like to walk up and put my great

01:05:54.781 --> 01:05:59.518
axe just under his chin. Just as a reminder.

01:05:59.518 --> 01:06:01.433
MATT: Okay. Keyleth, you're casting?

01:06:01.433 --> 01:06:02.674
MARISHA: I'm going for it.

01:06:02.674 --> 01:06:03.860
MATT: All right, so we'll say--

01:06:03.860 --> 01:06:06.361
MARISHA: He has to succeed on a wisdom saving
throw against me.

01:06:06.361 --> 01:06:08.006
MATT: We'll get there. It takes you a full minute
to cast it.

01:06:08.006 --> 01:06:09.052
MARISHA: Oh yeah.

01:06:09.052 --> 01:06:11.076
MATT: Every round he gets to resist the Sleep
spell.

01:06:11.076 --> 01:06:13.611
LIAM: (whispers) Percy! Could you give me a hand
over here?

01:06:13.611 --> 01:06:14.853
TALIESIN: Sure, all right.

01:06:14.853 --> 01:06:16.531
LAURA: (whispers) What are you doing?

01:06:16.531 --> 01:06:19.730
LIAM: (whispers) There's something down in this
hole. Do you think you could hold on to this

01:06:19.730 --> 01:06:21.069
tightly while I climb down?

01:06:21.069 --> 01:06:22.426
TALIESIN: Yeah, no, I've got it. I've got it.

01:06:22.426 --> 01:06:23.647
TRAVIS: Classic line.

01:06:23.647 --> 01:06:24.460
LIAM: All right.

01:06:24.460 --> 01:06:28.778
MATT: Actually, no. This spell just puts them
straight to sleep. So, this spell, he is asleep

01:06:28.778 --> 01:06:32.259
for the duration. You finish your Geas spell.

01:06:32.259 --> 01:06:33.920
LIAM: It worked on you.

01:06:33.920 --> 01:06:35.643
TRAVIS: They all work on me.

01:06:35.643 --> 01:06:39.941
MATT: All righty.

01:06:39.941 --> 01:06:45.402
TRAVIS: There's nothing in there. I keep drinking
out of it. There's nothing in it!

01:06:45.613 --> 01:06:48.838
LIAM: (whispers) Grog, there's a diamond up my
butt.

01:06:48.838 --> 01:07:02.059
MATT: All right, so we have Geas. So it has to
make a wisdom saving throw. So what is the DC?

01:07:02.059 --> 01:07:06.586
Spell DC.

01:07:06.586 --> 01:07:08.212
ORION: Yeah, stop posing for just a second.

01:07:08.212 --> 01:07:09.979
SAM: Spellcasting DC.

01:07:09.979 --> 01:07:13.258
MARISHA: What, it's wisdom. Oh, against my spell
save?

01:07:13.258 --> 01:07:14.045
MATT: Yes.

01:07:14.045 --> 01:07:15.161
SAM: What's your DC?

01:07:15.161 --> 01:07:16.520
MARISHA: 18.

01:07:16.520 --> 01:07:23.163
MATT: 18, all right. As the Sleep spell wears off,
his eyes begin to flicker and you see the strength

01:07:23.163 --> 01:07:32.545
flexing in his muscle form. As you hold the axe
there, his one slashed but, you know, not bleeding

01:07:32.545 --> 01:07:37.524
in this moment, eye. It seems that a lot of the
fancy robe has absorbed whatever was oozing from it.

01:07:37.615 --> 01:07:38.689
TRAVIS: Right.

01:07:38.689 --> 01:07:40.138
TALIESIN: Very absorbent fancy robe.

01:07:40.138 --> 01:07:50.284
MATT: He glances down at you. In this horrible,
guttural series of phrases and consonants

01:07:50.284 --> 01:07:53.806
(speaks Undercommon).

01:07:53.806 --> 01:07:54.666
SAM: What's he saying?

01:07:54.666 --> 01:07:56.008
MATT: Anyone speak Undercommon?

01:07:56.008 --> 01:07:56.841
LAURA: I do.

01:07:56.841 --> 01:07:57.833
ASHLEY: I do.

01:07:57.833 --> 01:07:58.699
SAM: Oh, it's not Giant.

01:07:58.699 --> 01:08:00.282
MATT: The two of you--

01:08:00.282 --> 01:08:03.817
TRAVIS: I speak two languages!

01:08:03.817 --> 01:08:05.005
MATT: You do.

01:08:05.005 --> 01:08:06.432
ASHLEY: You speak Undercommon?

01:08:06.432 --> 01:08:08.121
TRAVIS: No, but not, no.

01:08:08.121 --> 01:08:13.387
MATT: He says, essentially, "What have you done?
What do you need?"

01:08:13.387 --> 01:08:23.183
LAURA: I speak back to him. And say, "K'Varn. For
him, or against him?"

01:08:23.183 --> 01:08:24.720
TRAVIS: No, good, yeah.

01:08:24.720 --> 01:08:26.107
MARISHA: It's like a political rally?

01:08:26.107 --> 01:08:28.269
MATT: Its eye, slowly, tweaks over back towards
Keyleth.

01:08:28.269 --> 01:08:29.544
SAM: She's the one.

01:08:29.544 --> 01:08:31.452
MATT: "What do you ask of me?"

01:08:31.452 --> 01:08:33.477
LAURA: Oh, got it.

01:08:33.477 --> 01:08:43.520
MARISHA: Follow our orders. Help us fight K'Varn.
Vex, how do you say, "Follow our orders," in

01:08:43.520 --> 01:08:44.550
Underdark?

01:08:44.550 --> 01:08:47.375
LAURA: Oh, it's, (gibberish).

01:08:47.375 --> 01:08:51.120
SAM: The accent is on the 'kh'.

01:08:51.120 --> 01:08:52.567
LAURA: Be all like, 'kh'.

01:08:52.567 --> 01:08:55.248
TRAVIS: Yeah, you got it. Back of the throat.

01:08:55.248 --> 01:08:57.341
MARISHA: (gibberish)

01:08:57.341 --> 01:08:59.019
LAURA: Yes, yes. Very good.

01:08:59.019 --> 01:09:01.936
MATT: The giant takes a moment, and his head nods
slowly, like--

01:09:01.936 --> 01:09:03.384
SAM: Is it like a French person?

01:09:03.384 --> 01:09:04.183
MATT: Kind of, yeah.

01:09:04.183 --> 01:09:05.421
(laughter)

01:09:05.421 --> 01:09:07.486
MATT: Manages to get the gist across.

01:09:07.486 --> 01:09:13.708
SAM: (French accent) I don't know what you're
saying. Oh, 'unh'! Oh, I understand now.

01:09:13.708 --> 01:09:16.236
MARISHA: How do I say 'kill'?

01:09:16.236 --> 01:09:18.854
LAURA: (retching noise)

01:09:18.854 --> 01:09:24.715
MARISHA: I look at him and I go (retching noise)
K'Varn!

01:09:24.715 --> 01:09:26.113
TALIESIN: That accent was terrible.

01:09:26.113 --> 01:09:29.927
MARISHA: Shut up, Percy. I'm not from here,
clearly.

01:09:29.927 --> 01:09:31.737
TALIESIN: Everyone knows that, now.

01:09:31.737 --> 01:09:34.647
MATT: All right.

01:09:34.750 --> 01:09:38.976
MARISHA: (retching noise) K'Varn.

01:09:38.976 --> 01:09:43.355
MATT: He looks down at the chains and looks
expectantly at you.

01:09:43.355 --> 01:09:44.968
MARISHA: Follow our orders.

01:09:44.968 --> 01:09:46.405
LAURA: Hmm? Oh.

01:09:46.405 --> 01:09:47.973
ORION: Take the chains off.

01:09:47.973 --> 01:09:49.055
LAURA: Should we take the chains off?

01:09:49.055 --> 01:09:50.481
ORION: I believe we should take the chains off.

01:09:50.481 --> 01:09:52.379
LAURA: Make him agree, first.

01:09:52.379 --> 01:09:54.484
MATT: He seems to be in agreement.

01:09:54.484 --> 01:09:56.252
LAURA: Okay, cool.

01:09:56.252 --> 01:09:57.346
MATT: Best you can tell.

01:09:57.346 --> 01:10:00.030
MARISHA: You roll with us.

01:10:00.030 --> 01:10:01.498
LAURA: I start taking the chains off.

01:10:01.498 --> 01:10:02.799
MARISHA: You our posse now.

01:10:02.799 --> 01:10:04.609
LAURA: Very carefully, taking the chains off.

01:10:04.609 --> 01:10:07.374
MATT: You get the chains off and as each hand is
free, he (grunts) shakes it free.

01:10:07.374 --> 01:10:08.556
LAURA: Oh, okay.

01:10:08.556 --> 01:10:10.844
MATT: All you kind of jump back for a second and
places it on the ground and stands up to his full

01:10:10.844 --> 01:10:17.600
height around you. I'll assume that you're no
longer a naga as you cast a spell. Eventually, he

01:10:17.600 --> 01:10:24.072
gets to his full height and stands there looking
down at all of you. Kind of glancing around, grabs

01:10:24.072 --> 01:10:31.466
the large, hardened piece of wood and stone that
he's fashioned this club out of and glances and

01:10:31.466 --> 01:10:37.492
says to you. You translate for her. "Where?"

01:10:37.492 --> 01:10:39.672
SAM: Where.

01:10:39.672 --> 01:10:40.817
TRAVIS: A man of few words.

01:10:40.817 --> 01:10:43.031
LAURA: He wants to know where.

01:10:43.031 --> 01:10:44.834
ORION: I saunter up. Hello.

01:10:44.834 --> 01:10:46.409
TRAVIS: Christ.

01:10:46.409 --> 01:10:50.177
ORION: I'm really impressed. Are you our friend,
now?

01:10:50.177 --> 01:10:52.057
LAURA: Tiberius, do you speak Underdark?

01:10:52.057 --> 01:10:56.382
MARISHA: I don't think he can understand you.
There's a translation barrier going on.

01:10:56.382 --> 01:11:01.030
ORION: Oh, well, wonderful! Tell him to follow our
orders. That's all he needs to know for now.

01:11:01.030 --> 01:11:02.526
MARISHA: I already told him that.

01:11:02.526 --> 01:11:03.443
ORION: Oh, good!

01:11:03.443 --> 01:11:05.149
MARISHA: He's in our posse.

01:11:05.149 --> 01:11:07.216
SAM: He's asking where. We should tell him.

01:11:07.216 --> 01:11:08.130
TRAVIS: Temple.

01:11:08.130 --> 01:11:09.958
LAURA: But tell him to stay for now.

01:11:09.958 --> 01:11:14.419
MARISHA: Well, you, here, for now.

01:11:14.419 --> 01:11:15.669
SAM: She's going to translate.

01:11:15.669 --> 01:11:19.895
MARISHA: You. We roll together.

01:11:19.895 --> 01:11:21.405
TRAVIS: (laughs) Jesus!

01:11:21.405 --> 01:11:23.673
(laughter)

01:11:23.673 --> 01:11:28.092
SAM: Go ahead and translate that.

01:11:28.092 --> 01:11:31.179
ORION: Vex, you got that? Could you translate
that?

01:11:31.179 --> 01:11:33.533
TRAVIS: I didn't even understand what-- (laughs)

01:11:33.533 --> 01:11:36.880
LAURA: Pike, do you want to tell him what she
said?

01:11:36.880 --> 01:11:39.244
MARISHA: I'm trying to say we roll deep.

01:11:39.244 --> 01:11:40.847
SAM: I speak Keyleth.

01:11:40.847 --> 01:11:42.322
(laughter)

01:11:42.322 --> 01:11:46.921
SAM: She's saying that he should wait here until
our instructions to attack.

01:11:46.921 --> 01:11:49.983
LAURA: Okay. Go ahead and translate that.

01:11:49.983 --> 01:11:59.214
ASHLEY: Oh, oh, uh. (speaks Undercommon)

01:11:59.214 --> 01:12:03.711
MATT: Slings the club onto his shoulder with a
hefty (impact sound). You all feel the actual

01:12:03.711 --> 01:12:10.892
impact on his body, just the nearby presence, the
air around him being pushed. Looks at you for a

01:12:10.892 --> 01:12:16.949
second. Looks back to Keyleth and gives a solid
nod and just stands there.

01:12:16.949 --> 01:12:21.304
MARISHA: I take that as a good nod.

01:12:21.304 --> 01:12:25.055
LAURA: Will this keep up while you're sleeping?
Just curious.

01:12:25.055 --> 01:12:26.355
MARISHA: It keeps up for 30 days.

01:12:26.355 --> 01:12:27.232
ORION: 30 days.

01:12:27.232 --> 01:12:28.233
LAURA: Oh we're set.

01:12:28.233 --> 01:12:29.236
TRAVIS: Awesome!

01:12:29.236 --> 01:12:30.503
ORION: I walk up to the giant and I take out my
jerky.

01:12:30.503 --> 01:12:33.341
LAURA: Can we heal him? If we heal him, will it
cancel it?

01:12:33.341 --> 01:12:34.656
LIAM: Vex'ahlia.

01:12:34.656 --> 01:12:35.934
LAURA: What?

01:12:35.934 --> 01:12:37.514
LIAM: Ask him what his name is.

01:12:37.514 --> 01:12:44.397
MATT: His hand reaches down and completely
envelops your fist. And just pulls away. Jerky is

01:12:44.465 --> 01:12:47.612
gone from your hand and you feel, probably, a few
scales went with.

01:12:47.612 --> 01:12:56.419
LAURA: I grunt at him. And ask what his name is.
"Vex-'ah-lia."

01:12:56.419 --> 01:13:01.017
ORION: Do we all have to say it that way,
Vex'ahlia?

01:13:01.017 --> 01:13:02.621
MATT: Just glares at you.

01:13:02.621 --> 01:13:03.731
LAURA: Oh, come on.

01:13:03.731 --> 01:13:08.251
ASHLEY: I'm going to tell him he's handsome.
(speaks Undercommon)

01:13:08.251 --> 01:13:12.295
(laughter)

01:13:12.295 --> 01:13:21.369
MATT: The big eye squints in confusion at the tiny
thing. And just keeps licking the remnants of beef

01:13:21.369 --> 01:13:24.666
jerky off his fingers that it just robbed Tiberius
of.

01:13:24.666 --> 01:13:26.660
ORION: He likes the jerky.

01:13:26.660 --> 01:13:28.515
ASHLEY: I thought I'd try.

01:13:28.515 --> 01:13:29.934
MARISHA: What should we call him?

01:13:29.934 --> 01:13:31.205
LAURA: I think we should name him--

01:13:31.205 --> 01:13:32.937
ORION: We should ask his name and be polite.

01:13:32.937 --> 01:13:34.339
SAM: We did, he didn't give it.

01:13:34.339 --> 01:13:35.749
LAURA: We should name him Tiny.

01:13:35.749 --> 01:13:36.650
MARISHA: Tiny!

01:13:36.650 --> 01:13:37.634
SAM: Tiny, that's clever.

01:13:37.634 --> 01:13:39.670
TALIESIN: Vax and I are still getting something
out of there.

01:13:39.670 --> 01:13:44.765
MATT: All right, so the two of you guys move
towards the pit. You're what, now? You are--

01:13:44.765 --> 01:13:46.983
TALIESIN: I'm lowering him down on a rope.

01:13:46.983 --> 01:13:52.910
MATT: Okay. You hold on, you get down. The spikes,
now that you are up close, you can see, are about

01:13:52.910 --> 01:13:54.982
five and a half feet in length.

01:13:54.982 --> 01:13:55.844
LIAM: Yes.

01:13:55.844 --> 01:14:01.095
MATT: At the base, about that wide. And pretty
nasty, jagged, covered in whatever rust, soot, ash

01:14:01.095 --> 01:14:02.197
found its way there.

01:14:02.197 --> 01:14:03.223
LIAM: Tetanus, yeah.

01:14:03.223 --> 01:14:09.268
MATT: It's nasty times. It's going to be a little
careful to get in there without hurting yourself.

01:14:09.268 --> 01:14:10.140
LIAM: All right.

01:14:10.140 --> 01:14:14.573
MATT: Go ahead and make just a straight dexterity
check.

01:14:14.573 --> 01:14:15.999
LIAM: That's a 25.

01:14:15.999 --> 01:14:20.608
MATT: 25. You manage to, Mission Impossible-style,
swing underneath, grab the rope. You manage to

01:14:20.608 --> 01:14:26.666
keep yourself at a lithe, side angle where you
reach between two of the jagged spikes. Reach down

01:14:26.666 --> 01:14:33.634
and grab this metal pole that was shining. Pull it
out and it's an intricate

01:14:33.634 --> 01:14:36.522
gold and bronze javelin.

01:14:36.522 --> 01:14:39.061
SAM: You found booty?

01:14:39.061 --> 01:14:46.417
LIAM: Pull me up. Well, I can't use this.

01:14:46.417 --> 01:14:47.718
LAURA: What is it?

01:14:47.718 --> 01:14:49.162
LIAM: It's a javelin. It's beautiful.

01:14:49.162 --> 01:14:50.570
TRAVIS: Will you inspect it?

01:14:50.570 --> 01:14:52.257
SAM: Beautiful things should go to Pike, I think.

01:14:52.257 --> 01:14:56.125
ASHLEY: Oh, Scanlan, but she has really good aim.

01:14:56.125 --> 01:14:59.978
LIAM: She doesn't really throw sharp, pointy
things. This would be good for you, big guy.

01:14:59.978 --> 01:15:04.624
SAM: I just feel that the gold of the javelin
would match the gold of your heart.

01:15:04.624 --> 01:15:06.022
ASHLEY: Oh, Scanlan!

01:15:06.022 --> 01:15:07.962
ORION: I'm going to inspect it. Arcana check. 23.

01:15:07.962 --> 01:15:09.162
MATT: 23. Okay.

01:15:09.162 --> 01:15:11.562
LIAM: I'm still holding it. Tell me about it.

01:15:11.562 --> 01:15:17.704
ORION: Oh, this is, of course, the Javelin of
Lightning. This javelin is a magic weapon. When

01:15:17.704 --> 01:15:22.561
you hurl it, and speak its command word, it
transforms into a bolt of lightning.

01:15:22.561 --> 01:15:24.065
SAM: Sounds a little "read"-y.

01:15:24.065 --> 01:15:25.035
ORION: Yeah.

01:15:25.035 --> 01:15:27.462
(laughter)

01:15:27.462 --> 01:15:29.829
ORION: You know what? I'm not on the clock. You
read it.

01:15:29.829 --> 01:15:31.773
(laughter)

01:15:31.773 --> 01:15:38.410
SAM: Bolt of lightning, five feet wide. Basically,
it's just lightning. But in a javelin.

01:15:38.410 --> 01:15:40.131
MATT: Pass it on to Grog.

01:15:40.131 --> 01:15:42.937
LIAM: I spin it, rotate it in my hand, handle
towards Grog.

01:15:42.937 --> 01:15:47.189
TRAVIS: (singsong) I have something that's magic.

01:15:47.189 --> 01:15:50.673
MATT: All right, so.

01:15:50.673 --> 01:15:52.710
TALIESIN: Oh boy.

01:15:52.710 --> 01:15:54.108
ASHLEY: What are you going to name it?

01:15:54.108 --> 01:15:55.239
TRAVIS: Penelope.

01:15:55.239 --> 01:15:57.603
MATT: You guys now stand on the outskirts of
Yug'voril. We're a little ways from Yug'voril and

01:15:57.603 --> 01:16:02.391
the fungal forests. In the distance, you can
barely see the dull, greenish glow of what

01:16:02.391 --> 01:16:07.428
encompasses the top of the temple. What is your
plan of action, as you've now bound a Fomorian to

01:16:07.428 --> 01:16:08.348
your will?

01:16:08.348 --> 01:16:09.842
LAURA: I feel like we should hop down into the
pit.

01:16:09.842 --> 01:16:10.918
SAM: Fomorian?

01:16:10.918 --> 01:16:11.977
LIAM: Of spikes?

01:16:11.977 --> 01:16:15.975
LAURA: No no no, not that pit. In the big pit. And
rest. And that way we're blocked from view.

01:16:15.975 --> 01:16:18.463
TALIESIN: Heal our, what are we calling him?

01:16:18.463 --> 01:16:19.518
LAURA: Tiny.

01:16:19.518 --> 01:16:20.693
TALIESIN: Tiny. Heal Tiny.

01:16:20.693 --> 01:16:22.002
MARISHA: He's a Fomorian?

01:16:22.002 --> 01:16:27.386
SAM: Just before we rest, does anyone have
knowledge of his race and his species? Any of his

01:16:27.386 --> 01:16:32.706
weaknesses or strengths? Can I do a history
check?

01:16:32.706 --> 01:16:34.498
ORION: I'll do a history check.

01:16:34.498 --> 01:16:35.756
MATT: Well, this will be more of a--

01:16:35.756 --> 01:16:38.154
SAM: That's a one.

01:16:38.154 --> 01:16:39.578
ORION: Nature check? What kind of check?

01:16:39.578 --> 01:16:41.766
MATT: Yeah, this would be a-- This will be just a
nature check.

01:16:41.766 --> 01:16:45.133
MARISHA: What are we checking?

01:16:45.133 --> 01:16:48.589
SAM: Nature check. Just to see, what are his
strengths and weakness? What about his race?

01:16:48.589 --> 01:16:51.621
MARISHA: Ooh! The Fromorians. Well, the
Fromorians--

01:16:51.621 --> 01:16:53.130
MATT: Foh-morians.

01:16:53.130 --> 01:16:54.351
MARISHA: For-morians.

01:16:54.351 --> 01:16:55.371
MATT: Foh-morians.

01:16:55.371 --> 01:16:56.335
MARISHA: Foh-morians.

01:16:56.335 --> 01:16:57.277
SAM: FOH-MOH-ree-ans.

01:16:57.277 --> 01:16:58.467
MARISHA: Foh-MOH-ree-ans.

01:16:58.467 --> 01:16:59.559
TALIESIN: Accent is just terrible.

01:16:59.559 --> 01:17:00.485
MATT: What'd you roll?

01:17:00.485 --> 01:17:03.627
MARISHA: An 18 plus ten, so 28. Fomo.

01:17:03.627 --> 01:17:07.304
MATT: All right. Between you and your
understanding of the Underdark, as well, you

01:17:07.304 --> 01:17:12.339
manage to suss out a Fomorian is a long-cursed
species of giant that lives in the Underdark,

01:17:12.339 --> 01:17:20.758
specifically. That's why its form is so malformed
and physically messed up. They are inherently very

01:17:20.758 --> 01:17:27.770
evil, very selfish creatures and the fact that you
even have it in your presence says well of your

01:17:27.770 --> 01:17:33.334
magic, but also means it's probably very, very,
very minimal in its control or ability to really

01:17:33.334 --> 01:17:35.634
help you unless it absolutely has to.

01:17:35.634 --> 01:17:37.504
ORION: The giant guy?

01:17:37.504 --> 01:17:39.058
MATT: So.

01:17:39.058 --> 01:17:41.852
MARISHA: Yeah. Well, I mean, it sort of has to.

01:17:41.852 --> 01:17:43.328
LAURA: Right?

01:17:43.328 --> 01:17:45.491
SAM: It doesn't have to do it with all its heart.

01:17:45.491 --> 01:17:47.294
MARISHA: It starts to fry his brain if he
doesn't.

01:17:47.294 --> 01:17:51.334
MATT: Sometimes things might want to take damage,
depending on what you tell it to do.

01:17:51.334 --> 01:17:52.143
LAURA: Oh.

01:17:52.143 --> 01:17:53.444
ORION: It depends on what we say.

01:17:53.444 --> 01:17:54.663
LAURA: Well, can we ask him?

01:17:54.663 --> 01:17:58.367
MATT: Just saying you're riding a very fine line
keeping this thing not thrashing and smashing your

01:17:58.367 --> 01:17:59.610
head right now.

01:17:59.610 --> 01:18:05.180
LAURA: Can we ask him, I mean, if K'Varn is
annoying to him, or if he likes him?

01:18:05.180 --> 01:18:06.766
MATT: You ask in Undercommon?

01:18:06.766 --> 01:18:08.167
LAURA: Yeah.

01:18:08.167 --> 01:18:17.467
MATT: The best you can get out of his response is
the equivalent of, "I don't really know or care. I

01:18:17.538 --> 01:18:26.184
"hunt. I find things that wander too far from this
city. And occasionally squash a dwarf or two."

01:18:26.184 --> 01:18:29.947
SAM: Do we know what sorts of things he either
hates or likes?

01:18:29.947 --> 01:18:31.730
TALIESIN: We've got a distraction!

01:18:31.730 --> 01:18:33.277
TRAVIS AND LAURA: Yeah!

01:18:33.277 --> 01:18:37.303
TALIESIN: Forget the fight. We can just send him
off into the city and that should be enough for us

01:18:37.303 --> 01:18:38.297
to sneak in.

01:18:38.297 --> 01:18:39.442
SAM: That's pretty good, too.

01:18:39.442 --> 01:18:40.748
LAURA: Yeah, that's true.

01:18:40.748 --> 01:18:42.627
ORION: I am not setting foot in that temple quite
yet.

01:18:42.627 --> 01:18:48.438
LAURA: No no no. We'll come up with an idea, but,
I mean, it's something. Keyleth, is it safe to

01:18:48.438 --> 01:18:51.448
sleep next to him? Or is he going to attack us
when we sleep?

01:18:51.448 --> 01:18:57.710
MARISHA: We might be able to box him up, or maybe
we should chain him up while we sleep or

01:18:57.710 --> 01:19:00.274
something. I don't know. I mean, he should be
okay.

01:19:00.274 --> 01:19:04.232
LIAM: Take the watch, like we normally do.

01:19:04.232 --> 01:19:08.099
MATT: Kima, looking at him, says, "I'm not
sleeping next to him."

01:19:08.099 --> 01:19:11.224
SAM: I'll sleep near you, Kima.

01:19:11.224 --> 01:19:16.704
MATT: Her eyes, for a moment, seem to dart to your
shoulder where you had previously shown her your

01:19:16.704 --> 01:19:23.688
awkward, purple, third nipple. "I'm fine, Scanlan,
but I-- I appreciate the offer?"

01:19:23.688 --> 01:19:25.501
SAM: Suit yourself.

01:19:25.501 --> 01:19:26.978
TALIESIN: That's just a sentence you don't hear
very often.

01:19:26.978 --> 01:19:29.546
ASHLEY: I have a question. You said he's a cursed
giant?

01:19:29.546 --> 01:19:35.647
MATT: Meaning, not him, individually. His actual
species long ago. It was a line of giants that was

01:19:35.647 --> 01:19:40.324
cursed by the Fae to be this horrible form.

01:19:40.324 --> 01:19:41.323
SAM: Well, let's rest.

01:19:41.323 --> 01:19:41.994
LAURA: Yeah.

01:19:41.994 --> 01:19:43.251
SAM: In shifts.

01:19:43.251 --> 01:19:45.582
LAURA: Maybe we can chain him up to something
while we sleep.

01:19:45.582 --> 01:19:47.695
SAM: No. We don't want to seem aggressive towards
him.

01:19:47.695 --> 01:19:48.690
LAURA: Oh, fine.

01:19:48.690 --> 01:19:50.334
ORION: He's fine for 30 days.

01:19:50.334 --> 01:19:52.973
LAURA: Who's taking the first watch? All right.

01:19:52.973 --> 01:19:54.234
TALIESIN: I'll take the first watch.

01:19:54.234 --> 01:19:55.779
LAURA: I gotta heal up.

01:19:55.779 --> 01:19:57.506
LIAM: I'll sit up with Percy.

01:19:57.506 --> 01:20:01.399
MARISHA: Well, hang on. What are we doing from
here? Because it's going to dictate what I pick.

01:20:01.399 --> 01:20:04.237
SAM: That's a good question. We're not going to
mount our full attack, are we?

01:20:04.237 --> 01:20:05.106
LAURA: Are we?

01:20:05.106 --> 01:20:05.842
TALIESIN: Why not?

01:20:05.842 --> 01:20:06.711
ORION: No, we are not.

01:20:06.711 --> 01:20:07.690
TALIESIN AND LAURA: Why not?

01:20:07.690 --> 01:20:08.453
SAM: We could.

01:20:08.453 --> 01:20:12.547
ORION: I am telling you right now, I am not
setting foot in that thing's lair.

01:20:12.547 --> 01:20:13.315
LAURA: Okay, tell us why.

01:20:13.315 --> 01:20:14.404
SAM: Until when?

01:20:14.404 --> 01:20:18.624
ORION: Until we figure out a damn way to get it
out of that lair.

01:20:18.624 --> 01:20:19.896
SAM: You want it out of the temple.

01:20:19.896 --> 01:20:20.951
ORION: Absolutely.

01:20:20.951 --> 01:20:22.371
TALIESIN: We're not going to be able to do that.

01:20:22.371 --> 01:20:28.325
ORION: Percy! I'm saying this right now, I'm not
stepping foot in that lair!

01:20:28.325 --> 01:20:30.460
TALIESIN: That's fine. We're not going to be able
to get him out, I don't think.

01:20:30.460 --> 01:20:31.840
ORION: I think we can, actually.

01:20:31.840 --> 01:20:33.190
TALIESIN: Well?

01:20:33.190 --> 01:20:34.859
ORION: My idea is this--

01:20:34.859 --> 01:20:36.384
LAURA: Okay, yes. Please, tell us.

01:20:36.384 --> 01:20:43.452
ORION: With the new addition of our giant friend,
we do have a great advantage. We can definitely

01:20:43.452 --> 01:20:52.541
make the distraction, as you say. I propose,
Keyleth and another stealth member somehow see a

01:20:52.541 --> 01:20:59.584
way if there is some kind of ventilation that
leads into the Major Butthole's chamber.

01:20:59.584 --> 01:21:01.249
LAURA: The temple that you won't set foot in.

01:21:01.249 --> 01:21:02.076
ORION: Yes.

01:21:02.076 --> 01:21:03.066
LAURA: You want somebody else to go into.

01:21:03.066 --> 01:21:03.755
ORION: Absolutely.

01:21:03.755 --> 01:21:04.755
LAURA: All right.

01:21:04.755 --> 01:21:09.580
ORION: And, when finding this, craft some type of
piping system where we could smoke him out. If he

01:21:09.580 --> 01:21:13.478
has to breathe, which I believe aberrations need
to breathe and eat.

01:21:13.478 --> 01:21:16.484
LAURA: Do I know that? Do aberrations need to
breathe?

01:21:16.484 --> 01:21:21.905
MATT: Best that you understand, not a lot of study
has gone into the breathing apparatuses of certain

01:21:21.905 --> 01:21:24.501
aberrations and the few that have been close
enough to a beholder

01:21:24.501 --> 01:21:26.537
haven't really tested that theory.

01:21:26.537 --> 01:21:28.196
LAURA: All right.

01:21:28.196 --> 01:21:33.622
ORION: If we smoke him out and he cannot breathe,
he must leave the facility. And if we go in there

01:21:33.622 --> 01:21:37.755
we would be at an extreme disadvantage in many
ways than we realize.

01:21:37.755 --> 01:21:39.382
TALIESIN: How are we going to smoke him out?

01:21:39.382 --> 01:21:43.377
ORION: I just proposed the idea. I don't know, but
that's what we all need to figure out.

01:21:43.377 --> 01:21:50.556
LAURA: Okay, I've also got an idea. I mean, what
about that whole plan to break apart the apparatus

01:21:50.556 --> 01:21:52.343
that was holding the Elder Brain together?

01:21:52.343 --> 01:21:53.537
TALIESIN: That's my thought.

01:21:53.537 --> 01:21:57.959
LAURA: I think we need to go over the top, once
the distraction is in the city, blah blah blah. Go

01:21:57.959 --> 01:22:01.827
over the top, acid that metal, break it apart.

01:22:01.827 --> 01:22:03.183
SAM: Or giant that metal.

01:22:03.183 --> 01:22:06.000
LAURA: I think it'd be hard to get the giant up to
the top of the temple.

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:10.612
MARISHA: But we can send the giant beating on the
front temple door.

01:22:10.612 --> 01:22:12.106
LAURA: But this is a brainstorming session,
everything's positive.

01:22:12.106 --> 01:22:13.248
SAM: Well, not everything.

01:22:13.248 --> 01:22:18.013
LAURA: Acid, whatever, break it apart. Release the
illithids from his control and then we'll have

01:22:18.013 --> 01:22:20.648
them on our side. At least, not our side, but
against him.

01:22:20.648 --> 01:22:21.715
ORION: That's what I'm talking about.

01:22:21.715 --> 01:22:22.662
TALIESIN: Absolutely.

01:22:22.662 --> 01:22:24.422
ORION: Oh, so there are prisoners, right?

01:22:24.422 --> 01:22:27.215
LAURA: All of the illithid in the city are his
prisoners. He's controlling everyone.

01:22:27.215 --> 01:22:32.927
ORION: Oh, so, I'm sorry, I was misled earlier. So
this is the good part of the plan. We do exactly

01:22:32.927 --> 01:22:34.321
what you're saying, first.

01:22:34.321 --> 01:22:37.160
LAURA: Oh, okay. That's good. I like your plan so
far.

01:22:37.160 --> 01:22:41.549
ORION: Clarota, here, will rally the illithid to
fight for us. That's when we

01:22:41.549 --> 01:22:42.932
smoke out the beholder.

01:22:42.932 --> 01:22:46.012
TALIESIN: Except, of course, by doing that, we've
destroyed the roof of the chamber, so there will

01:22:46.012 --> 01:22:47.972
actually just be nothing but ventilation.

01:22:47.972 --> 01:22:48.990
LAURA: Yes.

01:22:48.990 --> 01:22:50.047
MARISHA: No, it was already open, remember?

01:22:50.047 --> 01:22:51.775
ORION: We do it a different way. We don't go near
him.

01:22:51.775 --> 01:22:54.883
ASHLEY: Do we know that it's enclosed?

01:22:54.883 --> 01:22:56.173
MARISHA: No, it's open.

01:22:56.173 --> 01:22:57.602
TALIESIN: It's open.

01:22:57.602 --> 01:22:59.919
SAM: I can get the giant inside the temple.

01:22:59.919 --> 01:23:02.251
MATT: The top has the brass crossbar.

01:23:02.251 --> 01:23:03.432
LAURA: Ooh, I like that.

01:23:03.432 --> 01:23:06.506
TRAVIS: But what if he just controls the giant?

01:23:06.506 --> 01:23:08.686
LAURA: You know what, though? The beholder will
just take control of the giant.

01:23:08.686 --> 01:23:11.089
TALIESIN: That we're talking about destroying?

01:23:11.089 --> 01:23:12.868
MARISHA: Some sort of glass.

01:23:12.868 --> 01:23:16.407
MATT: Some sort of translucent material that fills
in the parts that aren't the brass.

01:23:16.407 --> 01:23:18.379
TALIESIN: That we're talking about destroying.

01:23:18.379 --> 01:23:20.188
ORION: The room that he's in is sealed up?

01:23:20.188 --> 01:23:21.446
MATT: It appears to be.

01:23:21.446 --> 01:23:22.941
LAURA: I think we should keep the giant as a
distraction.

01:23:22.941 --> 01:23:24.007
TRAVIS: I also have an idea.

01:23:24.007 --> 01:23:25.063
LAURA: Yes, Grog.

01:23:25.063 --> 01:23:27.581
TRAVIS: Ice cream and peanut butter mixed on a
cold stone.

01:23:27.581 --> 01:23:29.089
SAM: It will never work. It'll never work!

01:23:29.089 --> 01:23:30.033
ORION: Oh my god!

01:23:30.033 --> 01:23:30.907
ASHLEY: Oh, yum!

01:23:30.907 --> 01:23:32.211
ORION: That is incredible.

01:23:32.211 --> 01:23:33.836
TRAVIS: I've been thinking about it for days.

01:23:33.836 --> 01:23:38.798
SAM: How would you get the stone cold enough? You
would need all sorts of sides to add to it, to

01:23:38.798 --> 01:23:41.379
fold into it. It's a terrible idea.

01:23:41.379 --> 01:23:42.906
TRAVIS: I told you, I don't like thinking.

01:23:42.906 --> 01:23:51.155
LAURA: And then also another idea. What if you
used your Pillars, right, against the Beholder and

01:23:51.155 --> 01:23:55.298
trapped him in? Can you do that?

01:23:55.298 --> 01:23:57.435
ORION: I am not going anywhere near that temple.

01:23:57.435 --> 01:23:58.204
SAM: All right.

01:23:58.204 --> 01:24:00.117
LAURA: All right, all right. What if you're
outside the temple and you cast Pillars and then

01:24:00.117 --> 01:24:03.023
we go in? And you stand outside, Tiberius.

01:24:03.023 --> 01:24:05.509
ORION: I mean, I suppose that could work,
possibly.

01:24:05.509 --> 01:24:07.085
LAURA: What if you're on top?

01:24:07.085 --> 01:24:09.001
ORION: Just has to be line of sight, right?

01:24:09.001 --> 01:24:11.407
MATT: To where you want the pillar to come out of,
yeah.

01:24:11.407 --> 01:24:15.195
ORION: Mm-hm, right, yeah. Actually that could
work. I could do it from afar,

01:24:15.195 --> 01:24:16.625
maybe on the carpet.

01:24:16.625 --> 01:24:19.547
LAURA: That gives us something to hide behind,
right? At least, with his eyeballs.

01:24:19.547 --> 01:24:21.280
ORION: Yes.

01:24:21.280 --> 01:24:23.760
ASHLEY: We still have to go through the fungal
forest, right?

01:24:23.760 --> 01:24:24.550
LAURA: Yes.

01:24:24.550 --> 01:24:26.948
SAM: How far is the forest, before the city?

01:24:26.948 --> 01:24:32.197
MATT: All right, so, to bring the map on top,
here. Where you guys currently reside, which is

01:24:32.197 --> 01:24:39.962
this portion here. You imagine, based on the
distance you traveled, you have about a mile or so

01:24:39.962 --> 01:24:41.675
before you get to the city.

01:24:41.675 --> 01:24:42.662
LAURA: A mile.

01:24:42.662 --> 01:24:43.685
MATT: Maybe a little over a mile.

01:24:43.685 --> 01:24:45.175
ASHLEY: Man, I wish we had some Cold Stone right
now.

01:24:45.175 --> 01:24:49.513
MATT: Actually probably a mile and half before you
get into the city, which is about two miles from

01:24:49.513 --> 01:24:50.784
the temple.

01:24:50.784 --> 01:24:53.018
TRAVIS: Right? Doesn't that sound amazing?

01:24:53.018 --> 01:24:54.845
LIAM: We need to find a frost giant, first.

01:24:54.845 --> 01:24:57.238
TRAVIS: I'm just saying, we could leave this
fucker here, go mix some peanut butter and ice

01:24:57.238 --> 01:24:59.450
cream, everybody's happy!

01:24:59.450 --> 01:25:01.381
SAM: That plan is growing on me.

01:25:01.381 --> 01:25:03.276
ASHLEY: We'll sleep. Should we nap?

01:25:03.276 --> 01:25:04.812
SAM: Let's take a rest.

01:25:04.812 --> 01:25:10.637
LAURA: What are we going to do? We're just going
to go in without a plan? What are we going to do?

01:25:10.637 --> 01:25:13.738
ASHLEY: How's Vax's foot?

01:25:13.738 --> 01:25:15.682
SAM: Tomorrow we can stealth in and get some
intel.

01:25:15.682 --> 01:25:18.933
MATT: It's already been attempted to be healed
this day.

01:25:18.933 --> 01:25:20.888
LAURA: Oh, we can do it in the morning?

01:25:20.888 --> 01:25:22.574
MATT: Yeah, it's like a once a day kind of thing.

01:25:22.574 --> 01:25:27.410
TRAVIS: Liam, we need you to stealth in and get
some awesome recon, but that means

01:25:27.410 --> 01:25:29.049
you'll be at risk.

01:25:29.049 --> 01:25:30.852
TALIESIN: We're going to need to destroy the
mechanism.

01:25:30.852 --> 01:25:33.200
SAM: A suicide mission? He was born for this.

01:25:33.200 --> 01:25:37.904
LAURA: The big one is releasing the Elder Brain.
We need to do that before we teleport.

01:25:37.904 --> 01:25:42.525
MARISHA: Yeah. Okay, here's my thing. Why do we
need to do reconnaissance? We already know what we

01:25:42.525 --> 01:25:43.597
need to do.

01:25:43.597 --> 01:25:44.911
TALIESIN: We've already done reconnaissance.

01:25:44.911 --> 01:25:47.330
LIAM: Well, we saw through Keyleth's Scrying.

01:25:47.330 --> 01:25:49.189
LAURA: Right, so we know what's going on.

01:25:49.189 --> 01:25:50.407
LIAM: Somewhat.

01:25:50.407 --> 01:25:55.571
TALIESIN: We know that there's a mechanism inside
that room. We know that that's probably what's

01:25:55.571 --> 01:25:56.542
keeping the brain.

01:25:56.542 --> 01:25:58.218
ASHLEY: We should just go knock on the door.

01:25:58.218 --> 01:25:59.861
(laughter)

01:25:59.861 --> 01:26:01.082
ASHLEY: Hello?

01:26:01.082 --> 01:26:02.476
TRAVIS: I think Pike's onto something.

01:26:02.476 --> 01:26:07.263
SAM: We should do some recon. There might be
beings or creatures around there that we can

01:26:07.263 --> 01:26:09.981
distract, use to our advantage, something.

01:26:09.981 --> 01:26:14.516
LAURA: I feel like we should get up close, release
the giant, fly up over, do our shit, and then take him.

01:26:14.516 --> 01:26:16.744
SAM: All right, but we don't know how we're going
to break that thing.

01:26:16.744 --> 01:26:17.937
LAURA: Acid.

01:26:17.937 --> 01:26:19.016
SAM: We don't have acid.

01:26:19.016 --> 01:26:20.322
LAURA: We have acid.

01:26:20.322 --> 01:26:21.250
SAM: How much?

01:26:21.250 --> 01:26:22.438
ORION: I bring out the yellow vial.

01:26:22.438 --> 01:26:24.401
LAURA: And we've got a bunch of acid in Grog's
bag.

01:26:24.401 --> 01:26:25.615
SAM: We do have that yellow vial.

01:26:25.615 --> 01:26:26.840
TRAVIS: We have four acid vials, plus that.

01:26:26.840 --> 01:26:28.457
ORION: This is the thing that's going to hurt the
most.

01:26:28.457 --> 01:26:29.951
SAM: We don't know. It could make it stronger.

01:26:30.173 --> 01:26:33.240
MARISHA: Well, I mean, I could do some Heat Metal
and weaken it.

01:26:33.240 --> 01:26:36.197
ASHLEY: I feel like we should save that acid for
the beholder.

01:26:36.197 --> 01:26:41.051
TRAVIS: Remember, the argument was also that it
will be magically treated to withstand simple acid.

01:26:41.051 --> 01:26:45.838
MARISHA: The Elder Brain casing was, not
necessarily the cross.

01:26:45.838 --> 01:26:52.908
TALIESIN: I want to experiment on the-- I want to
do a couple things. I want to first take, using my

01:26:52.908 --> 01:26:59.075
little kit, I want to just beaker off a tiny bit
of it and expose it to some organic matter to see

01:26:59.075 --> 01:27:00.145
how it reacts.

01:27:00.145 --> 01:27:00.975
MATT: Okay.

01:27:00.975 --> 01:27:03.384
TALIESIN: And expose it to a little bit of
inorganic matter to see how it reacts.

01:27:03.384 --> 01:27:11.525
MATT: So you take a bit of the swirling, yellow,
orange-ish viscous fluid out of-- You place it

01:27:11.525 --> 01:27:18.286
against some organic matter, which, you find
somewhere in the vicinity, partially rotted chunks of--

01:27:18.286 --> 01:27:19.317
TALIESIN: Flesh.

01:27:19.317 --> 01:27:24.650
MATT: -- flesh from the pile the Fomorian was
sleeping on. As you place it on, it blackens the

01:27:24.650 --> 01:27:27.179
flesh around it. There is a sizzling sound.

01:27:27.179 --> 01:27:31.498
TALIESIN: Interesting. Now I want to try it on
some inorganic matter.

01:27:31.498 --> 01:27:33.972
MATT: Which organic matter? Which inorganic
matter?

01:27:33.972 --> 01:27:35.004
LAURA: Do we have any metal?

01:27:35.004 --> 01:27:36.301
SAM: I have a dagger that I never use.

01:27:36.301 --> 01:27:39.160
ASHLEY: I have some rusty instruments.

01:27:39.160 --> 01:27:40.656
SAM: Great. Rusty instruments?

01:27:40.656 --> 01:27:41.751
ASHLEY: From the torture room.

01:27:41.751 --> 01:27:43.094
ORION: Do you have a rusty trombone?

01:27:43.094 --> 01:27:46.564
(groaning and laughter)

01:27:46.564 --> 01:27:48.702
ORION: Sorry. What? I don't understand.

01:27:48.702 --> 01:27:53.380
SAM: I use my Minor Illusion to create a (failure
horn sound).

01:27:53.380 --> 01:27:56.258
(laughter)

01:27:56.258 --> 01:28:01.147
TALIESIN: I would like a couple things. I would
like one of the rusty instruments and I would like

01:28:01.147 --> 01:28:02.590
one of the diamonds, please.

01:28:02.590 --> 01:28:04.355
TRAVIS: Yeah, here. You can have it. Here.

01:28:04.355 --> 01:28:05.878
LAURA: No! Oh, Percy, why?

01:28:05.878 --> 01:28:09.253
TALIESIN: So that we find out if it's going to be
useful. If it's just acid, it won't do a thing to

01:28:09.253 --> 01:28:10.407
the diamond.

01:28:10.407 --> 01:28:11.616
TRAVIS: How about a sapphire?

01:28:11.616 --> 01:28:12.860
TALIESIN: Or a sapphire, fine.

01:28:12.860 --> 01:28:16.464
TRAVIS: My fine blue sapphire that's been in here
for a year and a half. You can have it.

01:28:16.464 --> 01:28:17.764
LIAM: Care for some Cold Stone?

01:28:17.764 --> 01:28:21.771
TALIESIN: And some Cold Stone. I want to try it on
some ice cream with peanut butter.

01:28:21.771 --> 01:28:22.882
(laughter)

01:28:22.882 --> 01:28:25.527
TALIESIN: I want to mix the acid in. Add some
raspberries.

01:28:25.527 --> 01:28:28.259
MATT: So you're putting it on?

01:28:28.259 --> 01:28:32.356
TALIESIN: On one of the rusty instruments, and on
a sapphire.

01:28:32.356 --> 01:28:33.673
ASHLEY: What's a rusty trombone?

01:28:33.673 --> 01:28:34.938
(laughter)

01:28:34.938 --> 01:28:36.221
SAM: Oh, Pike.

01:28:36.221 --> 01:28:37.354
TALIESIN: Shutting it down.

01:28:37.354 --> 01:28:38.767
MATT: (shouts) Google will answer that at the
break!

01:28:38.767 --> 01:28:40.308
MARISHA: Don't Google it.

01:28:40.308 --> 01:28:41.805
SAM: Chatroom, please help out Ashley.

01:28:41.805 --> 01:28:44.118
LAURA: No no no. Don't.

01:28:44.118 --> 01:28:49.408
MATT: So, as you take a dab of it and you place it
on the rusty instrument, which actually looks like

01:28:49.408 --> 01:28:55.901
some weird hooked crowbar-type implement. The rust
immediately cleans off and the metal underneath

01:28:55.901 --> 01:29:02.273
begins to slowly warp and bend and then dissolve
at the place where you dripped it.

01:29:02.273 --> 01:29:03.750
SAM: Good, that's good.

01:29:03.750 --> 01:29:11.076
MATT: Placing it on the sapphire, it kind of coats
it, slips off and begins to burn the ground around

01:29:11.076 --> 01:29:12.257
the sapphire.

01:29:12.257 --> 01:29:13.637
TALIESIN: Interesting, all right.

01:29:13.637 --> 01:29:14.628
SAM: Good on metal.

01:29:14.628 --> 01:29:16.796
TALIESIN: Good on metal, not so good, necessarily
on--

01:29:16.796 --> 01:29:18.682
LAURA: On jewels. That's okay.

01:29:18.682 --> 01:29:24.005
TALIESIN: If the glass is glass, the glass will
break. If the glass is something else, we may have

01:29:24.005 --> 01:29:25.251
to burrow through it.

01:29:25.251 --> 01:29:28.185
LAURA: Sapphire's okay, then? Is it clean? Does it
have any acid still on it?

01:29:28.185 --> 01:29:29.652
TRAVIS: It's coming back to me, don't reach for
it.

01:29:29.652 --> 01:29:31.759
TALIESIN: I'm going to clean off the sapphire.

01:29:31.759 --> 01:29:39.125
MATT: Clean it off. It looks like there are very,
very minor pockmarks across the surface, but yeah.

01:29:39.125 --> 01:29:41.293
TALIESIN: We're good. We're very, very good.

01:29:41.293 --> 01:29:42.659
TRAVIS: I'll take the sapphire back.

01:29:42.659 --> 01:29:48.550
MARISHA: I can possibly-- I'll make sure I learn
Heat Metal and I can heat the edges of the

01:29:48.550 --> 01:29:55.851
crossbeam. And then if we can have Grog bring
something heavy after we've weakened it.

01:29:55.851 --> 01:29:58.022
LAURA: I know! I think a big weight, once it's
been acid-ed.

01:29:58.022 --> 01:29:59.288
SAM: How about a giant?

01:29:59.288 --> 01:30:00.271
TRAVIS: I could just jump on it.

01:30:00.271 --> 01:30:02.414
LAURA: Well, it's on the top of the temple, that's
what I mean. If you can jump on it, then we'll be

01:30:02.414 --> 01:30:03.590
going down with it.

01:30:03.590 --> 01:30:04.894
TRAVIS: (high-pitched) Yeah, that's all right.

01:30:04.894 --> 01:30:06.508
ORION: It will simply just heat it.

01:30:06.508 --> 01:30:08.719
MARISHA: Hot metal bends.

01:30:08.719 --> 01:30:14.904
LIAM: We've had a lot of success flying around,
right? What if, and I don't know who does what,

01:30:14.904 --> 01:30:22.814
but what if one small group flew in with Tiny in
the form of a mouse. And then--

01:30:22.814 --> 01:30:24.104
SAM: Dropped him.

01:30:24.104 --> 01:30:29.739
LIAM: With instructions and drop him, and in
mid-fall, a cursed giant lands at the front door.

01:30:29.739 --> 01:30:33.727
And if you're on the flying carpet dropping him,
you get out of there.

01:30:33.727 --> 01:30:38.679
LAURA: What if cursed giant lands on the metal
beam after we've already weakened it?

01:30:38.679 --> 01:30:40.156
TRAVIS: Yeah, I like that more.

01:30:40.156 --> 01:30:41.650
LIAM: That's good too.

01:30:41.650 --> 01:30:43.569
LAURA: Yeah, that is good.

01:30:43.569 --> 01:30:46.799
LIAM: But he could go apeshit on us.

01:30:46.799 --> 01:30:50.592
LAURA: No no no. Not if he's alone up there. What
if we do it, do it, do it--

01:30:50.592 --> 01:30:56.536
SAM: I think what Vax is proposing is to create a
diversion down there while we work on the metal.

01:30:56.536 --> 01:30:58.319
Try to weaken it.

01:30:58.319 --> 01:31:04.951
LIAM: Half the team gets into position on the top
of that thing. The other half splits off, drops

01:31:04.951 --> 01:31:10.736
the giant, the giant goes apeshit for like a
minute. Right? Drawing help away from the

01:31:10.736 --> 01:31:16.447
beholder, drawing attention down there. We wait
for a minute, then start pouring acid and Grog

01:31:16.447 --> 01:31:19.758
smashes it with his fucking forehead.

01:31:19.758 --> 01:31:21.792
LAURA AND TRAVIS: Yes.

01:31:21.792 --> 01:31:33.141
MARISHA: Can you levitate or do something to move
a giant boulder that we can drop on top of it?

01:31:33.141 --> 01:31:35.751
ORION: Of course I can.

01:31:35.751 --> 01:31:46.050
LIAM: Can we recap on your-- You looked in using
your magics, and you saw-- Tell us what she told us.

01:31:46.050 --> 01:31:48.520
LAURA: Can we remember? I have advantage to recall
information.

01:31:48.520 --> 01:31:53.952
MATT: Essentially what you had seen in the vision
was, within this room, there is that giant brass,

01:31:53.952 --> 01:31:59.376
gold, bronze-looking structure that, almost like
an upside-down Christmas tree, it comes to a

01:31:59.376 --> 01:32:06.311
spiraling point above the Elder Brain pool, which
is in a raised platform in the center of the room.

01:32:06.311 --> 01:32:13.468
To one side, there are two large cages that
contain what look like some sort of skinless

01:32:13.468 --> 01:32:18.030
creatures that are currently being experimented
on. On the far end of that room, there is a table

01:32:18.030 --> 01:32:21.278
that was set up with implements. This is probably
in the process of what K'Varn has been, just

01:32:21.278 --> 01:32:28.606
having fun toying with flesh. On the opposite side
of the room, it was shrouded in darkness and that

01:32:28.606 --> 01:32:32.876
was where you saw K'Varn reveal itself out of the
shadow.

01:32:32.876 --> 01:32:37.833
TRAVIS: One question. If we break the thing at the
top and the upside-down Christmas tree falls into

01:32:37.833 --> 01:32:42.534
the Elder Brain pool thing, are we going to kill
all of the illithids in the city in one fell

01:32:42.534 --> 01:32:43.625
swoop?

01:32:43.625 --> 01:32:46.264
MARISHA: Well, according to Clarota, it was pretty
heavily--

01:32:46.264 --> 01:32:51.841
MATT: Which, at this point as you say that,
Clarota goes, "That is not an option."

01:32:51.841 --> 01:32:53.075
ORION: Not saying it is, Clarota.

01:32:53.075 --> 01:32:54.727
ASHLEY: No, we're just trying to see if, maybe, we
could--

01:32:54.727 --> 01:32:57.617
LAURA: We didn't want it to happen, we just were
making sure it wouldn't.

01:32:57.617 --> 01:33:05.401
MARISHA: You mentioned that the Elder Brain was
pretty protected from physical damage. That there

01:33:05.401 --> 01:33:07.820
was lots of magical enchantments and stuff?

01:33:07.820 --> 01:33:08.940
ORION: Ooh, that's right.

01:33:08.940 --> 01:33:18.148
MATT: "It is a powerful entity, but it has its
limits in its currently weakened form."

01:33:18.148 --> 01:33:25.880
LAURA: Okay. What if you cast Featherfall on it
as, right when we did it, and then we can move it

01:33:25.880 --> 01:33:26.932
out of the way?

01:33:26.932 --> 01:33:29.286
ORION: Doesn't quite work that way. It works on
creatures. I'm not sure I could do this.

01:33:29.286 --> 01:33:30.924
TALIESIN: I have a terrible idea.

01:33:30.924 --> 01:33:32.479
SAM: Great, let's hear it.

01:33:32.479 --> 01:33:34.285
TRAVIS: I'm full of those, but let's hear yours.

01:33:34.285 --> 01:33:41.087
TALIESIN: What if we break the fall of the device
with Clarota?

01:33:41.087 --> 01:33:44.124
LAURA: Clarota? What about-- Why Clarota?

01:33:44.124 --> 01:33:45.416
TALIESIN: Oh, so sorry.

01:33:45.416 --> 01:33:46.794
LAURA: The giant Tiny?

01:33:46.794 --> 01:33:47.987
LIAM: Kima. He means Kima

01:33:47.987 --> 01:33:52.844
TALIESIN: No, I'm saying, what if we lure it into
the center of the room and then drop the ceiling

01:33:52.844 --> 01:33:54.060
on top of it?

01:33:54.060 --> 01:33:55.011
MARISHA: Oh, you mean--

01:33:55.011 --> 01:33:56.394
LAURA: K'Varn?

01:33:56.394 --> 01:33:57.867
ALL: K'Varn.

01:33:57.867 --> 01:34:01.201
MATT: Clarota is currently stepping back with a
look of confusion.

01:34:01.201 --> 01:34:03.215
TALIESIN: I'm a bit tired. I'm so sorry.

01:34:03.215 --> 01:34:07.394
SAM: Your name is confusing to us. This is why we
wanted to call you Clarence. Sorry, sorry.

01:34:07.394 --> 01:34:11.141
MATT: At the term 'Clarence', you see the
tentacles go.

01:34:11.141 --> 01:34:13.835
LAURA: Oh, he's warming up to it. I think he's
liking it.

01:34:13.835 --> 01:34:16.942
ORION: Clarota, how much does the crystal weigh?

01:34:16.942 --> 01:34:28.244
MATT: "I do not know. I was not around when it was
created. I didn't know it existed until you saw

01:34:28.244 --> 01:34:35.738
"it. I have not been in the city in months. Nearly
a year."

01:34:35.738 --> 01:34:40.040
TALIESIN: I think it is definitely an option,
though. If we can lure it out of hiding and get it

01:34:40.040 --> 01:34:41.964
into the center of the room.

01:34:41.964 --> 01:34:45.305
LAURA: I thought the Elder Brain was directly
below it, so it would have to step on the Elder

01:34:45.305 --> 01:34:46.411
Brain in order to--

01:34:46.411 --> 01:34:47.737
TALIESIN: Is the Elder Brain directly below it?

01:34:47.737 --> 01:34:48.935
SAM: Seems too complicated.

01:34:48.935 --> 01:34:50.440
LIAM: It's not one large mind, right?

01:34:50.440 --> 01:34:57.192
MATT: It's a series of-- The way you saw it, it is
a cluster of brains that are kind of merged

01:34:57.192 --> 01:35:00.095
together into one large, hivemind mound.

01:35:00.095 --> 01:35:01.148
LIAM AND LAURA: Okay.

01:35:01.148 --> 01:35:02.315
TRAVIS: Who wants to go up on top?

01:35:02.315 --> 01:35:03.193
LAURA: Me!

01:35:03.193 --> 01:35:04.236
TRAVIS: Who would want to go down?

01:35:04.236 --> 01:35:07.669
MATT: Yeah, less a crystal and more a metallic
structure.

01:35:07.669 --> 01:35:16.935
MARISHA: What if, instead of letting it fall
before we fully break it, we take the rope and

01:35:16.935 --> 01:35:17.813
rope it.

01:35:17.813 --> 01:35:18.603
LAURA: Or chain.

01:35:18.603 --> 01:35:22.941
MARISHA: And chain, and then lift it and then take
it away.

01:35:22.941 --> 01:35:24.186
TALIESIN AND LAURA: Or just swing it.

01:35:24.186 --> 01:35:26.421
LAURA: So it doesn't fall all the way and it goes
at a pendulum.

01:35:26.421 --> 01:35:27.928
SAM: Complicated engineering.

01:35:27.928 --> 01:35:29.623
ORION: Keyleth, what did the structure look like
again?

01:35:29.623 --> 01:35:31.196
MARISHA: It looks like a beehive.

01:35:31.196 --> 01:35:32.635
TRAVIS: Like Phantom of the Opera.

01:35:32.635 --> 01:35:35.356
SAM: And it's made of metal and glass?

01:35:35.356 --> 01:35:42.894
MATT: It's a slowly, like a spiraling mass of
metallic pipes, tubes, metal bands that just

01:35:42.894 --> 01:35:47.110
slowly twists and comes to a gradual point, like
an upside-down Christmas tree.

01:35:47.110 --> 01:35:48.641
SAM: So if it falls, it would be bad on the
brain.

01:35:48.641 --> 01:35:51.446
LAURA: Right, yes. We can swing it.

01:35:51.446 --> 01:35:56.347
ORION: Many structures like this-- We won't have
to, maybe, do any of that. If we could just,

01:35:56.347 --> 01:36:02.435
merely bend the structure, I believe that would
compromise the magical integrity. Usually

01:36:02.435 --> 01:36:08.931
structures like this are designed for a particular
arcane reason. If we were to merely damage it,

01:36:08.931 --> 01:36:12.960
Grog you could just as you do to most things.

01:36:12.960 --> 01:36:16.049
TRAVIS: Are you looking to me to bend it. I was
like, can you metalbend? This is awesome. But you

01:36:16.049 --> 01:36:17.942
want me to get my sweet hands on it?

01:36:17.942 --> 01:36:23.666
ORION: I mean, I could probably help as well,
along with Clarota, but that's an option.

01:36:23.666 --> 01:36:26.097
TRAVIS: How do I get to it, though? I mean, if we
break--

01:36:26.097 --> 01:36:27.043
LAURA: Flying carpet.

01:36:27.043 --> 01:36:28.389
TRAVIS: No, I can't. It doesn't carry me.

01:36:28.389 --> 01:36:29.784
ORION: It would only carry you.

01:36:29.784 --> 01:36:34.156
MATT: It could carry a Grog and that's about it.

01:36:34.156 --> 01:36:35.226
ORION: Right.

01:36:35.226 --> 01:36:40.448
TRAVIS: I could be like that pilot at the end of
Independence Day that's just flying up into the--

01:36:40.448 --> 01:36:42.427
(laughter)

01:36:42.427 --> 01:36:43.765
TRAVIS: "I'm back!"

01:36:43.765 --> 01:36:45.638
LIAM: So you are Randy Quaid.

01:36:45.638 --> 01:36:50.144
TRAVIS: Randy Quaid, which I've always aspired to
be. I'm in, I'll do it.

01:36:50.144 --> 01:36:53.874
LIAM: Are we 100% certain there's no nooks or
crannies, or holes, or anything? We don't want to

01:36:53.874 --> 01:36:55.123
go have a look?

01:36:55.123 --> 01:36:56.893
SAM: Yeah, we should go have a look tomorrow
morning.

01:36:56.893 --> 01:37:01.126
MARISHA: Go have a look, why? You're just going to
get caught.

01:37:01.126 --> 01:37:03.173
SAM: Why? Because-- No, we're not going to get
caught.

01:37:03.173 --> 01:37:05.877
LIAM: You're assuming we know everything there is
to know about this structure. About the city

01:37:05.877 --> 01:37:06.826
around it.

01:37:06.826 --> 01:37:12.297
TRAVIS: We're talking about a chance to
gamble with his life. Let's let him do it.

01:37:12.297 --> 01:37:14.962
SAM: Yeah, we should go. We should know all we can
know.

01:37:14.962 --> 01:37:18.433
MARISHA: I'm just wondering what more you're going
to find out from a flyby that I couldn't find out

01:37:18.433 --> 01:37:19.719
from my vision.

01:37:19.719 --> 01:37:23.158
LIAM: Well, I don't know how to tell you the
things that you don't know yet, because you don't

01:37:23.158 --> 01:37:24.273
know them.

01:37:24.273 --> 01:37:27.438
ORION: Hold on. Vax, are you planning on going
alone? That's silly.

01:37:27.438 --> 01:37:28.553
LIAM: Take this guy.

01:37:28.553 --> 01:37:29.558
ORION: That's even more silly.

01:37:29.558 --> 01:37:31.102
LAURA: Because all his stealth checks lately have
been perfect.

01:37:31.102 --> 01:37:33.599
LIAM: He can go invisible. We'll just take a peek.

01:37:33.599 --> 01:37:35.518
ASHLEY: Should we do it? Should we nap and then
you guys go?

01:37:35.590 --> 01:37:36.782
LAURA: Let's do it. Let's nap.

01:37:36.782 --> 01:37:38.159
TRAVIS: Let's do it. Nap! We nap and rest.

01:37:38.159 --> 01:37:42.096
MATT: All right, so you guys take an evening of
rest. We'll take this as our break. Our little

01:37:42.096 --> 01:37:46.361
quick ten-minute break, guys. We'll make it quick
so we can get back to this, because we have a lot

01:37:46.361 --> 01:37:47.739
to try and cram into this evening.

01:37:47.739 --> 01:37:49.015
LIAM: United as one!

01:37:49.015 --> 01:37:52.405
MATT: So we'll see you guys shortly. Wait, do we
have a--

01:37:52.405 --> 01:37:53.711
ZAC: I have a quick announcement.

01:37:53.711 --> 01:37:54.529
MATT: Yes.

01:37:54.529 --> 01:37:58.537
ZAC: So Malcadale-- Malhadale was the one that
sent you guys--

01:37:58.537 --> 01:38:00.641
(cheering)

01:38:00.641 --> 01:38:01.695
MATT: Thank you so much!

01:38:01.695 --> 01:38:02.687
ASHLEY: Huzzah!

01:38:02.687 --> 01:38:03.663
LAURA: I love him.

01:38:03.663 --> 01:38:04.630
ORION: He sent me this?

01:38:04.630 --> 01:38:05.472
TRAVIS: Grand merci.

01:38:05.472 --> 01:38:06.242
MATT: Yeah.

01:38:06.242 --> 01:38:08.840
ZAC: That was actually for Matt, and I wasn't
going to call it out on screen.

01:38:08.840 --> 01:38:09.621
ORION: Well, I'm keeping it.

01:38:09.621 --> 01:38:12.975
MATT: I think you should keep it. It has a
dragon.

01:38:12.975 --> 01:38:14.619
ZAC: I got in trouble for saying it was yours.

01:38:14.619 --> 01:38:16.227
ORION: Yeah. That's fine.

01:38:16.227 --> 01:38:18.978
MATT: I think the mouse is actually-- Keyleth, so
the staff--

01:38:18.978 --> 01:38:21.587
ZAC: I'm not sure. Those were sent from-- The
mouse and the bear were sent by somebody else, so

01:38:21.587 --> 01:38:26.691
just yell at me in the chatroom and tell me whose
that is. Ben Funkinator won the first giveaway.

01:38:26.691 --> 01:38:27.884
TALIESIN: Yay!

01:38:27.884 --> 01:38:33.160
ZAC: And we are only like 23 away from another
giveaway. And here's the thing, guys, since that

01:38:33.160 --> 01:38:41.771
next giveaway is at 3,000, which is a huge, huge
goal of ours, I'll give away three signed photos

01:38:41.771 --> 01:38:48.297
and three signed books. Instead of one giveaway,
we'll do three giveaways to celebrate 3k. And I have

01:38:48.331 --> 01:38:54.912
notified some of the troops that we could possibly
hit 3k subs, so they are on their way back to

01:38:54.912 --> 01:38:59.376
dance with us tonight. Some of our people. You
guys don't have to stay, but you're more than

01:38:59.376 --> 01:39:05.362
welcome to, except I was told by Erika that if we
hit 3k subs you have to dance Careless Whisper

01:39:05.362 --> 01:39:09.779
with her. That's what Erika told me, she was
like--

01:39:09.779 --> 01:39:11.272
TRAVIS: Without your shirt on.

01:39:11.272 --> 01:39:12.730
ZAC: That has to happen if we hit 3k.

01:39:12.730 --> 01:39:14.576
ORION: All right, how many are we away from that?

01:39:14.576 --> 01:39:16.356
ZAC: We're only, like, 23 away.

01:39:16.356 --> 01:39:18.610
ASHLEY: That's fair.

01:39:18.610 --> 01:39:23.315
MATT: I will say if we're pushing to go to a dance
party after this, since this is maybe a climatic,

01:39:23.315 --> 01:39:26.498
slightly overtime game, then we got to take a very
short break.

01:39:26.498 --> 01:39:27.971
TRAVIS: Yeah yeah. Like five minutes max.

01:39:27.971 --> 01:39:28.955
MATT AND ZAC: Five-minute break.

01:39:28.955 --> 01:39:30.096
MATT: See you guys here in a second.

01:39:30.096 --> 01:39:31.189
ORION: Let's go.

01:39:31.189 --> 01:40:38.119
[dramatic music]

01:40:38.196 --> 01:40:47.646
TRAVIS: Right, Listen up! If you have ale, then
you have a friend in Grog Strongjaw. A goliath of

01:40:47.646 --> 01:40:55.438
towering height and size, this barbarian has an
appetite for the two great loves in his life:

01:40:55.438 --> 01:40:59.285
combat, women, and ale! (chuckle)

01:40:59.285 --> 01:41:01.156
(record scratch) Wait.

01:41:01.156 --> 01:41:07.720
Easily the brains of the group, Grog is often
consulted for his vast knowledge of shapes,

01:41:07.720 --> 01:41:11.454
colors, and (chuckle) shiny things!

01:41:11.454 --> 01:41:13.135
Also ale.

01:41:13.135 --> 01:41:19.020
In his early years, armed with his two-handed
great axe, Grog often enjoyed proving his might

01:41:19.020 --> 01:41:25.478
amongst the ranks of his family's wandering herd.
But after coming upon an unsuspecting elderly

01:41:25.478 --> 01:41:33.436
gnome in the woods, he objected to the killing of
such an innocent life. A creature of impulse, Grog

01:41:33.436 --> 01:41:41.138
felt only pity for this-- well, this terrified
little thing. And his disobedience cost him

01:41:41.138 --> 01:41:42.471
dearly.

01:41:42.471 --> 01:41:50.855
Beaten bloody and banished by the herd leader, his
uncle Kevdak, Grog was abandoned and left to die,

01:41:50.855 --> 01:41:57.559
exiled from his herd. It was then that the
relative of the very gnome he fought to save,

01:41:57.559 --> 01:42:05.542
saved him. It was the kindness of a gnome cleric
named Pike that healed Grog, bringing him back

01:42:05.542 --> 01:42:10.920
from death's edge. And they have remained close
friends ever since.

01:42:10.920 --> 01:42:18.175
Most nights, Grog can be found challenging entire
taverns to wrestling matches! Ha! Or accompanying

01:42:18.175 --> 01:42:23.720
Scanlan to the nearest house where you pay for
lady favors.

01:42:23.720 --> 01:42:26.356
Also ale!

01:42:27.390 --> 01:42:31.196
MARISHA: A first impression of Keyleth would leave
you with little information on the half-elven

01:42:31.196 --> 01:42:36.069
druid. You might even think that her social
awkwardness due to her sheltered upbringing is

01:42:36.069 --> 01:42:37.961
kind of sweet. (chuckle)

01:42:37.961 --> 01:42:44.880
Of course, it would be unwise to underestimate her
based on first impressions. (thunder) Under that

01:42:44.880 --> 01:42:50.659
unintimidating petite frame is a vicious beast
waiting to be unleashed, whose natural powers have

01:42:50.659 --> 01:42:56.003
made even the fiercest of champions pee their
pants, literally! (soft chuckle)

01:42:56.003 --> 01:43:02.188
Born to the Air Tribe of the Ashari people,
Keyleth was raised with a deep love of nature and

01:43:02.188 --> 01:43:07.910
the elemental magics. It is her people's inherent
duty to protect the delicate areas in Tal'Dorei

01:43:07.910 --> 01:43:12.304
where the four elemental planes begin to bleed
with this realm.

01:43:12.304 --> 01:43:17.547
Since she was a little girl, she had quite a knack
for air manipulation and beast shaping abilities.

01:43:17.547 --> 01:43:25.018
Well, if you consider kittens and flying squirrels
to be little beasts. Which, I do. (clears throat)

01:43:25.018 --> 01:43:30.825
Anyways, it wasn't long before the headmaster of
the tribe, her father, Korren, realized her true

01:43:30.825 --> 01:43:35.974
prodigious abilities and she was inveterated to
succeed him as the next headmaster.

01:43:35.974 --> 01:43:42.209
Just like that, her jovial childhood was stripped
and replaced with endless spell memorization,

01:43:42.209 --> 01:43:48.293
teachings from ancient traditions, and exceedingly
high expectations. Every druid leader to be must

01:43:48.293 --> 01:43:53.276
embark on a journey to seek out the sister tribes
in order to introduce and establish respect

01:43:53.276 --> 01:44:00.667
amongst the fellow headmasters. They call this the
Aramente, or Noble Odyssey. When her father felt

01:44:00.667 --> 01:44:07.021
she was ready, he set her on the path to truly
discovering herself, not knowing when, or if, she

01:44:07.021 --> 01:44:08.501
will ever return.

01:44:08.501 --> 01:44:13.908
As she hiked down the mountain towards Stillben,
she meditated on the task ahead. Part of the

01:44:13.908 --> 01:44:20.166
Aramente is proving yourself a strong warrior, a
valiant protector, and a wise and compassionate

01:44:20.166 --> 01:44:29.199
leader. With this knowledge, one thought plays on
repeat in her mind: Is she even worthy?

01:44:31.427 --> 01:44:35.783
TALIESIN: Percy was the third of seven children,
born to a noble family who lived far to the north

01:44:35.783 --> 01:44:41.851
in the ancient castle of Whitestone. With so many
siblings to share the burdens of lordship, Percy

01:44:41.851 --> 01:44:46.541
turned his attentions to the sciences,
engineering, and naturalism.

01:44:46.541 --> 01:44:52.917
One day, a mysterious couple named Lord and Lady
Briarwood came to court. During a feast held in

01:44:52.917 --> 01:44:58.869
their honor, the Briarwoods violently took control
of the castle, killing or imprisoning everyone who

01:44:58.869 --> 01:45:01.079
would stand in their way.

01:45:01.079 --> 01:45:06.444
Percy awoke chained in the dungeon, only to be
freed by his younger sister. Together they fled,

01:45:06.444 --> 01:45:12.538
chased by the Briarwoods' men. As they ran,
Percy's sister took several arrows to the chest

01:45:12.538 --> 01:45:19.013
and fell. Percy kept running, eventually jumping
into a freezing river and floating unconscious to

01:45:19.013 --> 01:45:24.544
freedom. He did not remember waking up on a
fishing boat. He barely remembered the next two

01:45:24.544 --> 01:45:28.959
years, as he slowly made his way as far south as
possible.

01:45:28.959 --> 01:45:35.468
Then one night, Percy had a dream. A roaring cloud
of smoke offered him vengeance against those who

01:45:35.468 --> 01:45:43.397
destroyed his family. When he awoke, Percy began
to design his first gun. (gunshot)

01:45:45.136 --> 01:45:50.221
ASHLEY: Pike grew up on the outskirts of town,
near the Bramblewood. Her ancestors were a family

01:45:50.221 --> 01:45:56.035
of deep gnomes with quite an unfavorable
reputation. Thievery, destruction, and trickery

01:45:56.035 --> 01:46:02.298
left them with the curse of the last name
Trickfoot. Sarenrae, the goddess of healing and

01:46:02.298 --> 01:46:07.148
redemption, had other plans for Pike's
great-great-grandfather Wilhand, who left his

01:46:07.237 --> 01:46:13.638
family at a young age after a dream: a dream that
changed the course of the Trickfoot family.

01:46:13.638 --> 01:46:18.983
Wilhand devoted his life to Sarenrae and pledged
from then on that him and his family would live a

01:46:18.983 --> 01:46:21.425
life of service and devotion.

01:46:21.425 --> 01:46:28.576
As a child, Pike seemed to have an affinity to
heal. Whether it was animals, people, or even

01:46:28.576 --> 01:46:34.718
flowers, she felt she had a purpose in making
things whole that had once been broken. She

01:46:34.718 --> 01:46:38.276
studied and learned the ways to heal though divine
magic.

01:46:38.276 --> 01:46:44.800
She lived a peaceful life, quiet and simple, until
one day, Wilhand was captured and almost killed by

01:46:44.800 --> 01:46:50.069
a group of goliath barbarians. One of the goliaths
took a stand against the murder of the innocent

01:46:50.069 --> 01:46:57.293
gnome and he himself was beaten, bloodied, and
left for dead, abandoned by his herd. Wilhand went

01:46:57.293 --> 01:47:04.207
to Pike for help. She prayed and healed this
barbarian as best she could, bringing him back to life.

01:47:04.207 --> 01:47:06.116
When he awoke--

01:47:06.116 --> 01:48:13.400
[dramatic music]

01:48:13.487 --> 01:48:15.342
MATT: Welcome back!

01:48:15.342 --> 01:48:18.939
ZAC: Cool. Good game. Good game, bro.

01:48:18.939 --> 01:48:21.452
MATT: Yeah, we hit 3,000 on the break!

01:48:21.452 --> 01:48:23.372
(cheering)

01:48:23.372 --> 01:48:32.726
ZAC: Yeah, that's impressive! You guys are
awesome! So to enter in the giveaway you just have

01:48:32.726 --> 01:48:38.783
to be active in the chatroom. It could be as
simple as just posting: 'I love Zac, he's great!'

01:48:38.783 --> 01:48:39.900
That's all you have to write.

01:48:39.900 --> 01:48:43.040
LAURA: Or Vex. Whoever.

01:48:43.040 --> 01:48:47.447
ZAC: Or other people in the show, it's fine,
whatever. So just be active in the chat room. I'm

01:48:47.447 --> 01:48:50.354
going to go! I'm going to let these guys do their
thing. I don't want to give you guys any more

01:48:50.354 --> 01:48:56.344
interruptions until the show is over, so enjoy.
Just watch the chat room for giveaways! Thank you!

01:48:56.344 --> 01:49:06.156
MATT: So, back to the game at hand. You all, after
an evening of taking turns resting the best you

01:49:06.156 --> 01:49:13.447
can, nothing catches your eye, although
occasionally you see a little bit of movement,

01:49:13.447 --> 01:49:21.245
very slow movement just outside of your main light
radius along the edge of the top of the pit you

01:49:21.317 --> 01:49:27.523
guys slept in. Just kind of fade in and out,
something just drifted away. Eventually you all

01:49:27.523 --> 01:49:36.011
come to. Your Fomorian friend is just sitting
there in a very unfriendly, aggressively passive

01:49:36.011 --> 01:49:40.575
manner, just staring at the rest of the group.
Expectantly.

01:49:40.575 --> 01:49:44.127
TRAVIS: I offer him a sip from the cask of ale.

01:49:44.127 --> 01:49:47.228
MATT: He takes it in his hand. Which to him looks
like a small mug.

01:49:47.228 --> 01:49:49.031
TRAVIS: Right, just a sip.

01:49:49.031 --> 01:49:50.765
LAURA: Oh, he's going to drink the whole cask
down?

01:49:50.765 --> 01:49:52.123
ASHLEY: He's going to drink the whole cask.

01:49:52.123 --> 01:49:53.510
MATT: He peels the top of it off, breaking the
wood.

01:49:53.510 --> 01:49:54.840
TRAVIS: Don't do this to me. Don't do it.

01:49:54.840 --> 01:49:55.685
MATT: (gulps)

01:49:55.685 --> 01:49:56.991
TRAVIS: I will fucking kill you!

01:49:56.991 --> 01:49:59.201
MATT: (shattering noise)

01:49:59.201 --> 01:50:00.219
LAURA: Oh!

01:50:00.219 --> 01:50:02.903
TRAVIS: I would like--

01:50:02.903 --> 01:50:07.278
ALL: Grog! No no no!

01:50:07.278 --> 01:50:09.467
ASHLEY: Grog, we'll give you a whole thing of it!

01:50:09.467 --> 01:50:11.476
LAURA: He's so happy!

01:50:11.476 --> 01:50:19.521
ORION: Look, Grog! And I cast Prestidigitation and
I make fart noises. (fart noises)

01:50:19.521 --> 01:50:21.534
LAURA: Oh look! He's farting!

01:50:21.534 --> 01:50:22.869
ORION: Oh look, I'm farting!

01:50:22.869 --> 01:50:24.176
LIAM: Scanlan, start tap dancing!

01:50:24.176 --> 01:50:26.822
MARISHA: Oh no!

01:50:26.822 --> 01:50:29.322
MATT: Make a wisdom saving throw.

01:50:29.322 --> 01:50:30.919
ASHLEY: Grog, are you crying?

01:50:30.919 --> 01:50:38.876
TRAVIS: (grunts) 12!

01:50:38.876 --> 01:50:44.733
MATT: Should you choose to, you manage to resist
the urge to fly into a rage and smash your axe

01:50:44.733 --> 01:50:47.488
into the face of this entity.

01:50:47.488 --> 01:50:49.024
ORION: (makes fart noises)

01:50:49.024 --> 01:50:50.616
MATT: You bite your lips, you can taste the blood
in your mouth.

01:50:50.616 --> 01:50:55.727
LAURA: Oh Tiberius! Some farts! Look at those
farts!

01:50:55.727 --> 01:50:57.651
ORION: I figured he'd like that.

01:50:57.651 --> 01:51:00.618
TRAVIS: I run up his fat chest and I headbutt him
in the face!

01:51:00.618 --> 01:51:01.510
SAM: Oh shit!

01:51:01.510 --> 01:51:06.178
MATT: Okay!

01:51:06.178 --> 01:51:09.221
TRAVIS: It's my cask of ale!

01:51:09.221 --> 01:51:15.401
MATT: As Grog rushes up in a blur of angry motion,
you see a trail of froth in the corners of his

01:51:15.401 --> 01:51:20.958
mouth as his head comes colliding into the giant.
I'm going to say for this, go ahead and make an

01:51:20.958 --> 01:51:22.135
athletics check.

01:51:22.135 --> 01:51:25.279
LIAM: Tune in for the beholder fight three
weeks from today!

01:51:25.494 --> 01:51:26.722
TRAVIS: Natural 20!

01:51:26.722 --> 01:51:27.837
ASHLEY: Oh shit.

01:51:27.837 --> 01:51:29.628
MATT: Can you check for me?

01:51:29.628 --> 01:51:31.141
ASHLEY: That is a natural 20.

01:51:31.141 --> 01:51:35.544
TRAVIS: You don't fuck with Grog's cask of ale!

01:51:35.544 --> 01:51:36.984
ASHLEY: Clerics don't lie.

01:51:36.984 --> 01:51:38.812
SAM: Oh God, that's our giant.

01:51:38.812 --> 01:51:41.082
LIAM: He's being true to himself.

01:51:41.082 --> 01:51:42.725
ASHLEY: And he's dead.

01:51:42.725 --> 01:51:45.549
TRAVIS: Hey, it might be like a Fomorian thing! He
might like it!

01:51:45.549 --> 01:51:47.040
MARISHA: Oh God. Can I do something?

01:51:47.040 --> 01:51:55.658
MATT: So, as Grog runs up, full-force angrily
slams his goliath-skull into this large Fomorian

01:51:55.658 --> 01:52:04.132
Underdark giant, you hear what sounds like a clap
of thunder nearby, and you swear for a second, one

01:52:04.132 --> 01:52:11.201
of the two heads are about to crack or explode
from the sheer force of the impact. You see Grog,

01:52:11.201 --> 01:52:17.979
whose head is approximately a fifth the size of
this entity, has hit it with force so strong that

01:52:17.979 --> 01:52:23.059
in that breathless moment you're waiting for Grog
to scream out in pain with blood pouring down his

01:52:23.059 --> 01:52:30.534
face. However, it is the Fomorian who reels back
from the force of the blow, his giant eye closing

01:52:30.534 --> 01:52:39.302
in severe pain before he falls onto his back.
Stunned. (groans)

01:52:39.302 --> 01:52:44.759
TRAVIS: You owe me a cask of ale.

01:52:44.759 --> 01:52:50.309
MATT: As Grog stands over staring down at it, it's
only partially reminiscent-- and in your fury you

01:52:50.309 --> 01:53:01.232
didn't realize that you shouted at it in Giant. It
looks up at you and gives you a nod of momentary

01:53:01.232 --> 01:53:09.189
submission, as you step off of its body onto the
ground walking away extremely furious.

01:53:09.189 --> 01:53:13.639
TRAVIS: I'm grieving now. Leave me be.

01:53:13.639 --> 01:53:16.748
LAURA: Oh my God.

01:53:16.748 --> 01:53:19.078
MATT: Well, that happened.

01:53:19.078 --> 01:53:20.228
ASHLEY: Amazing.

01:53:20.228 --> 01:53:22.014
LIAM: Crisis averted.

01:53:22.014 --> 01:53:25.055
ASHLEY: I go over and pat him on the shoulder.

01:53:25.055 --> 01:53:26.768
TRAVIS: (tearfully) My cask of ale!

01:53:26.768 --> 01:53:29.911
ASHLEY: It's okay, Grog! I'll get you ten casks of
ale!

01:53:30.002 --> 01:53:31.185
TRAVIS: All right.

01:53:31.185 --> 01:53:32.768
ASHLEY: Once we-- If we live.

01:53:32.768 --> 01:53:35.309
TRAVIs: I have allergies down here.

01:53:35.309 --> 01:53:38.234
ORION: I pick up a piece of the cask, I take my
wheel out (whizzing noises).

01:53:38.234 --> 01:53:39.551
LAURA: What are you doing?

01:53:39.551 --> 01:53:41.027
LIAM: He's mending the cask.

01:53:41.027 --> 01:53:42.745
MATT: The Mending Wheel continues its process.

01:53:42.816 --> 01:53:44.665
TRAVIS: I've had that cask for two years, man!

01:53:44.665 --> 01:53:49.743
MATT: The Mending Wheel completely forms it into a
pure, untouched, perfect, empty cask.

01:53:49.743 --> 01:53:52.620
TRAVIS: Thank you, Tiberius.

01:53:52.620 --> 01:53:54.876
SAM: We will fill that cask with ale.

01:53:54.876 --> 01:53:58.947
LIAM: There's your woobie. You can sleep again.

01:53:58.947 --> 01:54:00.472
SAM: This is a promise cask.

01:54:00.472 --> 01:54:04.755
TRAVIS: Thank you. Woobie it is. Henceforth it
shall be called Woobie.

01:54:04.755 --> 01:54:06.343
LAURA: Good Job, Tiberius.

01:54:06.343 --> 01:54:09.847
ORION: I was trying to tell you that before you
hit the creature, but it worked out.

01:54:09.847 --> 01:54:16.086
SAM: All right, shall some of us stealth ahead to
the temple to see what we can see or should we set

01:54:16.086 --> 01:54:17.517
out on foot as well?

01:54:17.517 --> 01:54:18.945
LAURA: Wait! Do you want to do his foot first?

01:54:18.945 --> 01:54:20.160
LIAM: I was just about to say, does this look
normal to you?

01:54:20.160 --> 01:54:21.331
LAURA: (groans) Oh, come on!

01:54:21.331 --> 01:54:23.903
(laughter)

01:54:23.903 --> 01:54:27.851
LIAM: You know, I've got a lot of flexibility back
and it feels stronger, but it doesn't look quite right.

01:54:27.851 --> 01:54:29.022
LAURA: It looks disgusting!

01:54:29.022 --> 01:54:31.314
ASHLEY: All right! All right! Let's do it! So I
have to roll medicine?

01:54:31.314 --> 01:54:34.106
MATT: You roll medicine and what level healing you
want to use.

01:54:34.106 --> 01:54:36.335
ASHLEY: We're going to rest?

01:54:36.335 --> 01:54:38.627
MATT: You guys just rested. Everyone's spells are
back at full.

01:54:38.627 --> 01:54:40.262
ASHLEY: Oh, we just rested. Shit.

01:54:40.262 --> 01:54:44.829
MATT: Just keep in mind what spells you want to
have prepared, and keep in mind what may be ahead

01:54:44.829 --> 01:54:47.928
of you. So be sparing, I recommend.

01:54:47.928 --> 01:54:49.142
LAURA: Ugh, get it out of my face!

01:54:49.142 --> 01:54:50.977
SAM: Yeah, it's just a foot. Don't go crazy with
it, Pike.

01:54:50.977 --> 01:54:52.998
LIAM: I just want to be able to sneak better.

01:54:52.998 --> 01:54:55.519
ASHLEY: How do we know how much is left on-- We
don't?

01:54:55.519 --> 01:54:59.041
MATT: It looks like it's had advancement.

01:54:59.041 --> 01:55:01.335
LIAM: This is like the fourth time we've done
this.

01:55:01.335 --> 01:55:04.108
ASHLEY: So, 20 for medicine.

01:55:04.108 --> 01:55:05.511
MATT: Rolled 20 for medicine?

01:55:05.511 --> 01:55:06.328
ASHLEY: Yeah.

01:55:06.328 --> 01:55:11.354
MATT: All right, and what level healing spell are
you going to use? Just keep in mind the battle you

01:55:11.354 --> 01:55:12.557
may have ahead of you.

01:55:12.557 --> 01:55:17.151
ASHLEY: I know. Shit, I don't know what level to
do it at. Since we're going to the whole thing.

01:55:17.151 --> 01:55:18.529
LAURA: Do it level one.

01:55:18.529 --> 01:55:19.874
ASHLEY: Level one?

01:55:19.874 --> 01:55:22.698
LAURA: Sorry, brother.

01:55:22.698 --> 01:55:24.163
MATT: So 1d8 plus five.

01:55:24.163 --> 01:55:25.144
ASHLEY: All right.

01:55:25.144 --> 01:55:26.726
MATT: Mark off a level one spell casting.

01:55:26.726 --> 01:55:27.937
LAURA: It's almost healed.

01:55:27.937 --> 01:55:29.609
ASHLEY: I'm sorry.

01:55:29.609 --> 01:55:34.093
LAURA: We got a big battle, brother. Shouldn't
have fallen asleep in that--

01:55:34.093 --> 01:55:35.301
ASHLEY: Ten.

01:55:35.301 --> 01:55:41.855
MATT: Okay. So, that, and the medicine check, part
of the scarring from the lava burns that still

01:55:41.855 --> 01:55:50.481
remains, begin to heal over. Most of the scars are
gone. You're on the cusp of getting past your

01:55:50.481 --> 01:55:53.162
disadvantage, but not quite yet.

01:55:53.162 --> 01:55:56.027
LIAM: It's not nothing.

01:55:56.027 --> 01:55:59.485
LAURA: Sorry, your nubbin lives.

01:55:59.485 --> 01:56:02.513
MATT: All right. What's the plan?

01:56:02.513 --> 01:56:05.397
SAM: Yes, what is the plan? Are some of us setting
out on foot or are we just sending--

01:56:05.397 --> 01:56:07.685
TRAVIS: Yes. The stealthiest of the stealthy go.

01:56:07.685 --> 01:56:08.731
SAM: On foot.

01:56:08.731 --> 01:56:10.509
LAURA: No no no. On the carpet.

01:56:10.509 --> 01:56:11.649
SAM: On the carpet, okay.

01:56:11.649 --> 01:56:14.693
TRAVIS: Yeah. A little recon and then we--

01:56:14.693 --> 01:56:15.869
SAM: Just recon.

01:56:15.869 --> 01:56:16.855
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:56:16.855 --> 01:56:17.961
SAM: All right, I'm with you.

01:56:17.961 --> 01:56:24.334
MARISHA: I go ahead and cast Enhance Ability for
dexterity on Scanlan over here.

01:56:24.334 --> 01:56:26.545
SAM: What does it do?

01:56:26.545 --> 01:56:28.527
MATT: Gives you advantage on your dexterity
checks.

01:56:28.527 --> 01:56:30.090
TRAVIS: Is it just dexterity you can enhance, or
anything?

01:56:30.090 --> 01:56:34.673
MATT: No, and skills that are dexterity-based. So
stealth would have an advantage, which is nice.

01:56:34.673 --> 01:56:43.578
All right, so, we have Scanlan. There we go. Look
at these guys here on the new carpet.

01:56:43.578 --> 01:56:44.809
LAURA: That's adorable.

01:56:44.809 --> 01:56:46.164
MARISHA: New carpet!

01:56:46.164 --> 01:56:47.688
ASHLEY: That's awesome.

01:56:47.688 --> 01:56:50.621
MARISHA: It's advantage. You get to roll twice.

01:56:50.621 --> 01:56:57.999
MATT: So, as you guys hold place. The two of you
drift into the air.

01:56:57.999 --> 01:57:00.160
LAURA: Be careful!

01:57:00.160 --> 01:57:01.370
SAM: It's just us two?

01:57:01.370 --> 01:57:02.555
MATT: Just the two of you.

01:57:02.555 --> 01:57:05.249
SAM: Farewell, Pike. I'll miss you.

01:57:05.249 --> 01:57:06.649
ASHLEY: (sings) Goodbye my love!

01:57:06.649 --> 01:57:08.580
SAM: What? My love?

01:57:08.580 --> 01:57:11.393
ASHLEY: No, no. I-- Well, it's from a movie that I
saw.

01:57:11.393 --> 01:57:13.831
ORION: Pike, what is a movie?

01:57:13.831 --> 01:57:15.126
LIAM: Like a puppet show?

01:57:15.126 --> 01:57:18.440
ASHLEY: Oh, it's just like flashing pictures that
all move together.

01:57:18.440 --> 01:57:20.304
ORION: Oh, like light! Like that?

01:57:20.304 --> 01:57:21.221
TRAVIS: It flashes?

01:57:21.221 --> 01:57:22.165
ASHLEY: It flashes.

01:57:22.165 --> 01:57:24.364
SAM: All right, off we go.

01:57:24.364 --> 01:57:30.655
MATT: The two of you hop onto the carpet and begin
to slowly ride up past the treetops of the nearby

01:57:30.757 --> 01:57:35.004
fungal forest. As you curve upward into the air--

01:57:35.079 --> 01:57:37.516
SAM: (sings) I can show you the world.

01:57:37.587 --> 01:57:42.148
MATT: -- you get a very fine view of the city
proper. You can see a lot of these buildings in

01:57:42.148 --> 01:57:45.946
the outskirts of the city are rubble. They have
fallen in on themselves. They have collapsed. You

01:57:45.946 --> 01:57:53.504
can see pieces of foundation and ceilings and
rooftops that have caved in. And right in the

01:57:53.504 --> 01:57:59.642
center of the city is a very easy-to-see temple.
Which, in itself, is essentially a pyramid with a

01:57:59.738 --> 01:58:05.211
flattened top. There is that dull, greenish glow
that seems to just slowly trickle around the very

01:58:05.211 --> 01:58:12.698
top of the temple. As you are just starting to
crest over the top of the outskirts of the city

01:58:12.698 --> 01:58:17.924
proper, I'd say about here. Are you guys going
over the city? Are you following the outskirts?

01:58:17.924 --> 01:58:24.138
What's your plan of recon? You guys are currently
now moving this way.

01:58:24.138 --> 01:58:25.452
LAURA: Plan? What's that?

01:58:25.452 --> 01:58:26.825
SAM: I leave it to you.

01:58:26.825 --> 01:58:31.371
LIAM: Well, we're moving pretty fast. I say we go
all around the rim of the city.

01:58:31.371 --> 01:58:37.688
MATT: All right. Both of you roll stealth. With
advantage.

01:58:37.688 --> 01:58:40.170
LIAM: Advantage, you said?

01:58:40.170 --> 01:58:41.299
MATT: He has advantage.

01:58:41.299 --> 01:58:47.371
LIAM: I got a 14.

01:58:47.371 --> 01:58:48.677
SAM: 18.

01:58:48.677 --> 01:58:57.783
MATT: 14, 18. Okay. So, you guys begin to crest
around, and you look down and it's very, very

01:58:57.783 --> 01:59:04.960
dark. There are what looks like these greenish
spores that found pockets in the city that give

01:59:04.960 --> 01:59:10.785
off light. This very, very faint luminescence
within the city, and they get thicker and thicker

01:59:10.785 --> 01:59:16.209
and cluster and make the center of the city more
bright and easier to make out the details of. You

01:59:16.209 --> 01:59:20.239
don't know if these were placed there or if they
naturally grew there and just add the ambiance to

01:59:20.462 --> 01:59:26.879
it. But what you see in that little bit of light
as you glance down are many figures walking and

01:59:26.879 --> 01:59:28.027
moving through the city.

01:59:28.027 --> 01:59:28.997
LIAM: What figures?

01:59:28.997 --> 01:59:30.347
MATT AND SAM: Many figures.

01:59:30.347 --> 01:59:39.834
MATT: You can see humanoid-sized individuals
gliding through the city. 20, 30, 50 illithid

01:59:39.834 --> 01:59:44.787
visible in one section of the city. Each carrying
two to three slaves each. Some trolls, ogres,

01:59:44.787 --> 01:59:47.931
other dwarves, other creatures of the Underdark
that at this distance you cannot make out their

01:59:47.931 --> 01:59:55.727
form, but there is, essentially, a thriving
community down here of mind flayers. Some of them,

01:59:55.727 --> 01:59:59.935
it's hard to tell where they're going but there
are some going to and from the temple carrying

01:59:59.935 --> 02:00:07.644
small satchels or boxes. As they glide-- Or,
actually, they wouldn't be carrying it. Their

02:00:07.644 --> 02:00:13.157
slaves would be carrying for them and they're
keeping alongside them. As you continue around the

02:00:13.228 --> 02:00:19.544
side here, you start getting more into the ruined
area and this part of the town itself, on this

02:00:19.544 --> 02:00:28.862
side, is mostly nonfunctional. It's abandoned and
you can see the repurposed city construction by

02:00:28.862 --> 02:00:33.010
this colony has started in the center and over the
past few hundred years or as long as it's been

02:00:33.010 --> 02:00:39.490
here, it's slowly building and repairing outward.
As you crest around this side, you can see a far

02:00:39.490 --> 02:00:45.205
ruin about another half mile to a mile off from
where you are, too far away to catch any details

02:00:45.205 --> 02:00:52.893
of it. You cruise around this side, and you hear
this squeaking sound, this (squeaks), and you

02:00:52.893 --> 02:00:59.304
glance up, and you see what looks like a cluster
of bats moving to the top of the cavern. They're

02:00:59.304 --> 02:01:04.506
almost buzzing you guys in the head, up above,
ten, 20 feet ahead of you, they're just coming

02:01:04.506 --> 02:01:06.549
back and forth over you.

02:01:06.549 --> 02:01:09.208
TRAVIS: Sentries?

02:01:09.208 --> 02:01:11.680
ASHLEY: Yeah, sentry bats.

02:01:11.680 --> 02:01:15.281
MATT: You guys take it a little lower to kind of
get away from that. Eventually the bats stop

02:01:15.281 --> 02:01:20.612
harrowing you. You find your way back around. Come
to rest back at the camp.

02:01:20.612 --> 02:01:23.869
LAURA: Well?

02:01:23.869 --> 02:01:27.588
LIAM: And just to clarify, the part where we saw
all the illithid figures was

02:01:27.588 --> 02:01:30.030
on the opposite side, right?

02:01:30.030 --> 02:01:35.464
MATT: It was around this section, here. You saw,
in this portion of the city, which is the only one

02:01:35.464 --> 02:01:40.244
example. The best you can see around this, this
whole intersection right around the temple is

02:01:40.244 --> 02:01:47.580
pretty fairly populated with mind flayers and
their slaves.

02:01:47.580 --> 02:01:50.576
LIAM: (voice breaks) So the--

02:01:50.576 --> 02:01:52.065
TRAVIS: Puberty's a bitch.

02:01:52.065 --> 02:01:54.668
LIAM: (voice breaks) Yes. Well, I'm only 62.

02:01:54.668 --> 02:01:59.634
SAM: We need that big brain on our side?

02:01:59.634 --> 02:02:06.790
LIAM: Yeah, the city is crawling with illithid.
But more on the northern edge, not so much here on

02:02:06.790 --> 02:02:09.598
the side. And it's a lot. It's not a few, it's a
lot.

02:02:09.598 --> 02:02:12.686
LAURA: It's a city. We need the Elder Brain.

02:02:12.686 --> 02:02:17.389
LIAM: We need a distraction, though. That's the
only thing I took away from what we saw.

02:02:17.389 --> 02:02:20.466
SAM: Unless we all go in from the top.

02:02:20.466 --> 02:02:24.054
TRAVIS: Tiny and I had a meeting of the minds. We
could provide a distraction.

02:02:24.054 --> 02:02:26.525
LAURA: You wanna go against illithid?

02:02:26.525 --> 02:02:28.336
TRAVIS: I don't give a shit.

02:02:28.336 --> 02:02:31.897
TALIESIN: He does not want to go against
illithid.

02:02:31.897 --> 02:02:33.803
TRAVIS: Chaotic Neutral, baby!

02:02:33.803 --> 02:02:36.280
LIAM: Yeah, but they're going to take you over,
big guy.

02:02:36.280 --> 02:02:37.900
LAURA: They'll take you over and then we'll fight
you.

02:02:37.900 --> 02:02:43.435
LIAM: Here's what I think is better. We take Tiny,
transform him into a mouse. We fly over, just when

02:02:43.435 --> 02:02:50.386
we're over the right part of the city, flick him
in the mouse nuts, and toss him off. And then let

02:02:50.386 --> 02:02:57.561
him turn him back into Tiny, as he falls into a
pile of illithid and keeps them busy. We need to

02:02:57.561 --> 02:03:01.555
draw as much attention away from the beholder as
possible.

02:03:01.555 --> 02:03:02.791
LAURA: I like it.

02:03:02.791 --> 02:03:04.081
TALIESIN AND MARISHA: I like it.

02:03:04.081 --> 02:03:05.787
SAM: What will we be doing in the meantime?

02:03:05.787 --> 02:03:09.122
LAURA: We'll be going in over the top, trying to
get rid of the thing controlling the Elder Brain.

02:03:09.122 --> 02:03:11.063
ORION: We do not want that.

02:03:11.063 --> 02:03:13.040
TRAVIS: Yeah, there's going to be collateral
damage.

02:03:13.040 --> 02:03:16.160
ORION: No, I like the first half of that idea,
Vax.

02:03:16.160 --> 02:03:17.571
LIAM: The nut-flicking part?

02:03:17.571 --> 02:03:23.387
ORION: No. That idea will work as well, too. I
think what we should do is do the mouse thing.

02:03:23.387 --> 02:03:30.931
Whoever-- I guess we make the effort to go in,
however we can manage, to get into the top of

02:03:30.931 --> 02:03:37.093
wherever we are going to attack those beams, as it
were, to do damage to the thing controlling

02:03:37.093 --> 02:03:38.064
whatever.

02:03:38.064 --> 02:03:39.230
LAURA: Yes?

02:03:39.230 --> 02:03:45.798
ORION: That's when we should lightly drop him in
as a mouse. Because when this takes enough damage,

02:03:45.798 --> 02:03:52.004
which he should, as a mouse, the spell will wear
off. And he would poof back into whatever. We

02:03:52.004 --> 02:03:54.047
should do it right on the beholder.

02:03:54.047 --> 02:03:56.464
LAURA: Actually, I agree with that.

02:03:56.464 --> 02:04:00.638
ORION: Because that, I think, would be more a
distraction for the creature. A beast against a

02:04:00.638 --> 02:04:02.600
nasty beast is always a good fight.

02:04:02.600 --> 02:04:07.194
LAURA: If he's being controlled by you, can he not
be controlled by another being?

02:04:07.194 --> 02:04:11.669
MARISHA: It probably would be a contest of wills.

02:04:11.669 --> 02:04:15.356
LIAM: And he could turn the thing on us pretty
easily, I'm willing to believe.

02:04:15.356 --> 02:04:18.817
MARISHA: Well, what if we-- How about this, why
don't we turn him into a mouse and we can just

02:04:18.817 --> 02:04:25.054
keep him as our, you know, emergency pocket mouse,
and whenever, if we need a quick distraction, then

02:04:25.054 --> 02:04:28.333
we flick him in his mouse nuts and drop him over
and--

02:04:28.333 --> 02:04:30.152
TALIESIN: His poor mouse nuts.

02:04:30.152 --> 02:04:31.484
LAURA: I like it.

02:04:31.484 --> 02:04:34.516
ORION: We need all the people in the town alive.
Clarota will be upset if we hurt anybody and we

02:04:34.516 --> 02:04:42.370
need their aid. I suggest, because I have a
feeling that because this is his lair, he will

02:04:42.370 --> 02:04:50.529
have, and I'm talking about K'Varn, he will have
advantages that we do not understand. If we go in.

02:04:50.529 --> 02:04:51.884
And we will have disadvantages.

02:04:51.884 --> 02:04:52.998
TRAVIS: We don't want to go in.

02:04:52.998 --> 02:04:53.973
ORION: Exactly.

02:04:53.973 --> 02:04:56.648
LIAM: We're all open to an idea to get him out.
Have you got one?

02:04:56.648 --> 02:05:02.751
ORION: I'm saying, that is why. So if we threw our
rather large friend here in, and do the thing,

02:05:02.751 --> 02:05:09.475
that will get us control and Clarota can help us
manage everyone in the town.

02:05:09.475 --> 02:05:11.165
Even the slaves will rally.

02:05:11.165 --> 02:05:13.689
LAURA: They don't like Clarota. They aren't going
to listen to Clarota, especially if they're

02:05:13.689 --> 02:05:15.250
controlled by another being.

02:05:15.250 --> 02:05:16.787
TRAVIS: Yeah, they did exile him.

02:05:16.787 --> 02:05:20.009
MATT: Clarota puts the thought in your mind
immediately, basically, this very strong

02:05:20.009 --> 02:05:26.951
realization that, "Without the town freed, I have
no leverage with my people."

02:05:26.951 --> 02:05:30.582
ORION: That's what I'm saying. After we've
destroyed the mechanism.

02:05:30.582 --> 02:05:32.127
TALIESIN: Yes, that's the plan.

02:05:32.127 --> 02:05:33.622
MARISHA: After we've destroyed the mechanism,
yeah.

02:05:33.622 --> 02:05:35.503
ORION: Right. That's why we cannot attack the
town.

02:05:35.503 --> 02:05:38.042
TRAVIS: So are we saying we want to go up to the
top, we want to try and weaken the cross with the

02:05:38.042 --> 02:05:45.773
yellow and the acid, we want to drop Titmouse, the
giant, on the thing, hopefully, if it breaks. If

02:05:45.773 --> 02:05:50.390
it doesn't break, then what do we do?

02:05:50.390 --> 02:05:51.632
SAM: We Rage.

02:05:51.632 --> 02:05:53.267
(laughter)

02:05:53.267 --> 02:05:58.142
LIAM: And also, I don't understand, we're talking
about crashing the thing. But aren't we risking,

02:05:58.142 --> 02:06:04.058
at least, risking dropping the upside-down pyramid
onto the Elder Brain?

02:06:04.058 --> 02:06:05.739
MARISHA: That's why I was saying if we can--

02:06:05.739 --> 02:06:07.333
LAURA: We're going to tie a chain to it.

02:06:07.333 --> 02:06:12.073
MARISHA: I think if we tie a chain to it, I think
we break the beams and then air-evac it out,

02:06:12.073 --> 02:06:13.842
personally.

02:06:13.842 --> 02:06:15.423
TALIESIN: I think it might be too heavy.

02:06:15.423 --> 02:06:17.529
SAM: Evacuate it via air.

02:06:17.529 --> 02:06:22.711
LAURA: I feel like that uses way more time because
what's going to happen is once it happens, it's

02:06:22.711 --> 02:06:26.674
all going to go to shit. So once we drop it, we
should probably just fucking go.

02:06:26.674 --> 02:06:30.336
MARISHA: Well then, how about this? Why don't we
concentrate, instead of-- Because okay, it's a

02:06:30.336 --> 02:06:36.240
middle cross beam thing, right? Why don't, instead
of focusing on the middle section, we focus just

02:06:36.240 --> 02:06:39.897
on two sides, so it goes.

02:06:39.897 --> 02:06:41.404
TALIESIN: That's a good idea.

02:06:41.404 --> 02:06:49.046
SAM: May I throw a wrinkle into things? Those bats
didn't look good. Those are eyes that he's using

02:06:49.046 --> 02:06:55.280
to watch things above. So we gotta get through the
bats first. Or distract the bats, or get rid of

02:06:55.280 --> 02:06:56.646
the bats.

02:06:56.646 --> 02:07:01.114
ORION: Bats will be a problem. Bats catch fire
rather quickly, if I recall.

02:07:01.114 --> 02:07:04.636
LAURA: Maybe, Keyleth, you could turn into a bat
and tell them all to go a different direction.

02:07:04.636 --> 02:07:09.711
MARISHA: I can talk to the bats or I can Dominate
a bat. I could talk to the bats.

02:07:09.711 --> 02:07:12.061
TALIESIN: This is assuming the bats are going to
be a problem.

02:07:12.061 --> 02:07:15.107
LAURA: If it comes up, we'll deal with it. How
about that?

02:07:15.107 --> 02:07:16.883
MARISHA: I'll make sure I can talk to the bats.

02:07:16.883 --> 02:07:18.227
TALIESIN: I'm not afraid of bats.

02:07:18.227 --> 02:07:20.930
SAM: No no no. The bats will ruin our element of
surprise.

02:07:20.930 --> 02:07:22.789
LAURA: None of this is a surprise.

02:07:22.789 --> 02:07:24.534
TALIESIN: Do we have, really, an element of
surprise at this point?

02:07:24.534 --> 02:07:26.740
LAURA: None of it's a surprise. He knows we're
here.

02:07:26.740 --> 02:07:27.666
ASHLEY: Onward, ho?

02:07:27.666 --> 02:07:28.802
TALIESIN: Onward, ho.

02:07:28.802 --> 02:07:30.408
TRAVIS: Let's do it.

02:07:30.408 --> 02:07:32.590
SAM: We don't even know what we're doing.

02:07:32.590 --> 02:07:34.648
TRAVIS: Quit tip-toeing into the ocean, let's run
into this.

02:07:34.648 --> 02:07:40.134
MATT: Kima has finished wrapping the leather on
the handle of the great maul that she's holding.

02:07:40.134 --> 02:07:44.541
Grasps it in her hands, her armor freshly polished
after waking up this morning. Looks at the rest of

02:07:44.541 --> 02:07:51.061
you and says, "Are you ready to walk into the
great halls of the warrior minds before us?"

02:07:51.061 --> 02:07:52.821
ORION AND MARISHA: No.

02:07:52.821 --> 02:07:58.324
ASHLEY: Do you have any ideas, real quick. Or were
you hearing anything we were saying? Kima? I just

02:07:58.324 --> 02:08:01.739
mean there's a lot of ideas thrown out, but do you
have any idea, specifically?

02:08:01.739 --> 02:08:03.788
TALIESIN: Do you have anything to contribute?

02:08:03.788 --> 02:08:08.341
MATT: Kima looks at you for a second, and pulls
her own holy symbol out and says, "The guidance of

02:08:08.341 --> 02:08:16.270
"Bahamut has not steered me astray, as of yet. And
your deity also has brought you down here for a

02:08:16.270 --> 02:08:22.469
"great cause. I think, as long as they're both
looking over us, and we are straight and true with

02:08:22.469 --> 02:08:28.545
"our intent, we shall be fine. As far as the
tactics, they seem sound, as long as we can

02:08:28.545 --> 02:08:34.320
"maintain the element of surprise. I feel that if
that is given up, we may have to improvise.

02:08:34.320 --> 02:08:36.516
"Improvisation scares me."

02:08:36.516 --> 02:08:37.988
LAURA: Okay, okay.

02:08:37.988 --> 02:08:43.635
MATT: "So everything we can possibly do to
maintain a very quiet arrival is going to be the

02:08:43.635 --> 02:08:46.554
"key to success in this."

02:08:46.554 --> 02:08:49.574
SAM: So that's either a distraction or taking care
of bats.

02:08:49.574 --> 02:08:54.053
MARISHA: I mean, I could Fog Cloud us. We could
look like a big, floating cloud.

02:08:54.053 --> 02:08:57.018
SAM: Yeah, but if we float, then we're going to
float right through the fog.

02:08:57.018 --> 02:09:03.938
LAURA: What if we use a giant net and two of us
get up on the carpet and we use a big net and

02:09:03.938 --> 02:09:07.011
catch as many bats as we can.

02:09:07.011 --> 02:09:09.119
MATT: "Does anyone have a net?"

02:09:09.119 --> 02:09:10.548
LAURA: Do we have a net?

02:09:10.548 --> 02:09:13.321
TALIESIN: We do have a giant piece of leather that
makes us look like rock.

02:09:13.321 --> 02:09:17.895
SAM: Grog had Annette, back in Emon. She was
great.

02:09:17.895 --> 02:09:23.493
LIAM: I still think we should drop Tiny on top of
the-- or at least, near the main illithid

02:09:23.493 --> 02:09:28.134
encampment to keep them busy. K'Varn's eye will
turn there for a moment.

02:09:28.134 --> 02:09:34.289
TALIESIN: We can-- And we can attach the
camouflage back onto the flying carpet.

02:09:34.289 --> 02:09:36.195
SAM: We have camouflage?

02:09:36.195 --> 02:09:37.574
TALIESIN: We do.

02:09:37.574 --> 02:09:45.367
MATT: Clarota motions for a second and says, "We
also have to consider this temple has doorways in

02:09:45.367 --> 02:09:57.990
"and out. This chamber that K'Varn has taken has
ways to be opened and outside forces in. Do we

02:09:57.990 --> 02:10:05.779
"have a way to seal these entrances if we are to do
this fight, so we don't have any additional

02:10:05.779 --> 02:10:07.119
"visitors?"

02:10:07.119 --> 02:10:12.896
LAURA: Oh, good call. Great. Do you know where
those entrances are?

02:10:12.896 --> 02:10:15.072
MATT: K'Varn thinks for a second and says--

02:10:15.072 --> 02:10:17.364
LAURA: Your name's Clarota. I'm sorry.

02:10:17.364 --> 02:10:30.347
MATT: "There are, if I recall, two doors to the
room. Not large."

02:10:30.347 --> 02:10:32.887
TRAVIS: He doesn't need doors, right? He can make
portals and shit?

02:10:32.887 --> 02:10:35.196
SAM: No no. He'll need a door to let in other
people.

02:10:35.196 --> 02:10:37.595
MARISHA: Well, here's the thing are we trying to
actually-- We're not trying to get inside the

02:10:37.595 --> 02:10:38.863
temple.

02:10:38.863 --> 02:10:40.074
SAM: Yeah, we are.

02:10:40.074 --> 02:10:43.023
TRAVIS: No, we're trying to keep him from calling
in a fucking dragon or something. He can't

02:10:43.023 --> 02:10:45.254
Dimension Door in a dragon and be like, "Just
kidding."

02:10:45.254 --> 02:10:47.959
TALIESIN: He can call every single creature in the
city to come to his aid.

02:10:47.959 --> 02:10:49.247
TRAVIS: But he can't--

02:10:49.247 --> 02:10:52.349
TALIESIN: More than enough to deal with us.

02:10:52.349 --> 02:10:55.653
MATT: "Not if you damage the device."

02:10:55.653 --> 02:10:57.824
LAURA: We can just drop things in from above on
the temple and stay out of the temple.

02:10:57.824 --> 02:11:03.428
MATT: "If the device is damaged, he no longer has
sway over the illithid."

02:11:03.428 --> 02:11:07.092
TALIESIN: So then we want people to come into the
temple at that point.

02:11:07.092 --> 02:11:08.568
MATT: "Perhaps."

02:11:08.568 --> 02:11:10.872
ORION: No, that's when we get out and smoke him
out.

02:11:10.872 --> 02:11:16.022
TALIESIN: We're not going to set him on fire.

02:11:16.022 --> 02:11:20.307
LAURA: Maybe just give up on the smoking out?

02:11:20.307 --> 02:11:23.824
TRAVIS: I think hotboxing is now-- No?

02:11:23.824 --> 02:11:25.335
LIAM: Yeah.

02:11:25.335 --> 02:11:31.238
ASHLEY: If I were to use Divination soon, how long
does that last?

02:11:31.238 --> 02:11:33.055
MATT: Divination.

02:11:33.055 --> 02:11:34.826
LAURA: Is that the one where you call your deity?

02:11:34.826 --> 02:11:36.383
MATT: Oh, you mean Divine Inspiration?

02:11:36.383 --> 02:11:37.886
ASHLEY: Divine Inspiration, I'm sorry.

02:11:37.886 --> 02:11:39.128
MATT: That happens the moment you use it.

02:11:39.128 --> 02:11:40.297
ASHLEY: It happens the moment you use it.

02:11:40.297 --> 02:11:41.521
MATT: Yes.

02:11:41.521 --> 02:11:43.067
ASHLEY: Okay.

02:11:43.067 --> 02:11:49.189
LAURA: So we would know if she's going to help us?
Or would she help us that moment?

02:11:49.226 --> 02:11:53.247
MATT: It's not so much, "Hey god, come with me."
It's more like, "Please help me right now."

02:11:53.247 --> 02:11:56.630
Something may happen that turns the tide.

02:11:56.630 --> 02:12:01.335
ASHLEY: So is that something, just a question,
that I would do now or maybe in the battle?

02:12:01.335 --> 02:12:02.681
MATT: Maybe in the battle.

02:12:02.681 --> 02:12:03.615
ASHLEY: Okay.

02:12:03.615 --> 02:12:05.731
MATT: Like, the moment you need the help is the
moment it will happen, most likely.

02:12:05.731 --> 02:12:10.585
ASHLEY: Let's do that. All right. Just was having
a moment with god, for a minute, guys.

02:12:10.585 --> 02:12:12.038
Sorry, I'm back.

02:12:12.038 --> 02:12:17.557
SAM: Can we-- Before we make this journey, can we
sound off who's on what duty?

02:12:17.557 --> 02:12:18.970
LAURA: Right.

02:12:18.970 --> 02:12:22.349
SAM: Who's on damaging-the-device duty, who's
on--

02:12:22.349 --> 02:12:25.467
TRAVIS: I could give the four acid vials to
whoever has the yellow liquid who wants that

02:12:25.467 --> 02:12:26.573
responsibility.

02:12:26.573 --> 02:12:27.877
TALIESIN: I'll take--

02:12:27.877 --> 02:12:30.279
ASHLEY: I feel like we should use some of that,
though, for the beholder.

02:12:30.279 --> 02:12:33.076
TALIESIN: I want to save as much of it for the
beholder as possible.

02:12:33.076 --> 02:12:33.943
ASHLEY: Okay.

02:12:33.943 --> 02:12:34.855
TRAVIS: The yellow liquid?

02:12:34.855 --> 02:12:35.700
TALIESIN: Yes.

02:12:35.700 --> 02:12:38.366
TRAVIS: So who wants to pour the acid on the
cross? I could do that, but it's--

02:12:38.366 --> 02:12:40.542
LAURA: Percy-- Well, are you going up top?

02:12:40.542 --> 02:12:42.533
TRAVIS: I'm at everybody's disposal.

02:12:42.533 --> 02:12:47.378
TALIESIN: I'm going to head up top. Also, in the
fight, I'll be more use from a distance anyway.

02:12:47.378 --> 02:12:50.694
SAM: Who's on the shutting-off-those-doors duty?
Is that a thing that we need to assign to

02:12:50.694 --> 02:12:52.171
someone?

02:12:52.171 --> 02:12:54.022
MARISHA: Could you fashion--

02:12:54.022 --> 02:12:55.543
LAURA: That could be Keyleth.

02:12:55.543 --> 02:12:57.718
MARIHSHA: -- like a paintball?

02:12:57.718 --> 02:12:59.675
SAM: That could be you, but you're not going to be
there. You'll still stay behind?

02:12:59.675 --> 02:13:02.099
LAURA: Yeah, you guys, could you guys be in charge
of closing up the entrances?

02:13:02.099 --> 02:13:06.752
TALIESIN: Do we have any spare glass vials?

02:13:06.752 --> 02:13:09.643
TRAVIS: We do.

02:13:09.643 --> 02:13:11.338
TALIESIN: Can I have one?

02:13:11.338 --> 02:13:13.681
TRAVIS: Yeah. I give him a glass vial.

02:13:13.681 --> 02:13:15.943
MARISHA: Well, I'm flying people overtop, I'm
assuming.

02:13:15.943 --> 02:13:19.125
TALIESIN: Can I have a spare arrow? Vex?

02:13:19.125 --> 02:13:22.189
MARISHA: I think we should all be on top together.
I don't think we should try and separate.

02:13:22.189 --> 02:13:25.879
TALIESIN: Can I borrow a spare arrow?

02:13:25.879 --> 02:13:26.886
LAURA: Sure.

02:13:26.886 --> 02:13:28.094
MARISHA: A sparrow.

02:13:28.094 --> 02:13:29.040
TALIESIN: A sparrow.

02:13:29.040 --> 02:13:29.846
LAURA: Here you are.

02:13:29.846 --> 02:13:33.002
TALIESIN: I have a second, I want to see if I can
make a crude acid arrow out of a glass vial.

02:13:33.002 --> 02:13:36.129
LAURA: Take it, give it to me after it's done.

02:13:36.129 --> 02:13:37.854
TALIESIN: It's a Shatter, a straight up Shatter
arrow.

02:13:37.854 --> 02:13:42.490
MATT: Because of the rushed nature of this, go
ahead and make a roll.

02:13:42.490 --> 02:13:45.767
TALIESIN: It's a Proficiency bonus, plus--

02:13:45.767 --> 02:13:48.745
SAM: I will inspire him.

02:13:48.745 --> 02:13:50.833
TALIESIN: Thank you, please.

02:13:50.833 --> 02:13:53.489
SAM: (sings) Everything is awesome!

02:13:53.489 --> 02:13:56.993
SAM AND TALIESIN: (sings) Everything is cool when
you're making an arrow!

02:13:56.993 --> 02:13:59.145
MATT: Roll a d10, add it to the roll.

02:13:59.145 --> 02:14:02.256
TALIESIN: Ah, thank you. Oh my god.

02:14:02.256 --> 02:14:03.715
MARISHA: Aw.

02:14:03.715 --> 02:14:05.311
TALIESIN: Yeah, nine.

02:14:05.311 --> 02:14:11.801
MATT: Nine? As you're attempting to fashion it to
the arrow, unfortunately, the vial shatters in

02:14:11.801 --> 02:14:16.690
your hand. You take three points of acid damage.

02:14:16.690 --> 02:14:20.773
TALIESIN: Ow. I wasn't-- Aw, I wouldn't have put
the acid in yet. Okay, fine.

02:14:20.773 --> 02:14:22.949
MATT: It happens at the process of you setting it
up.

02:14:22.949 --> 02:14:24.457
TALIESIN: Damn it. All right.

02:14:24.457 --> 02:14:25.948
MATT: Based on the roll you made.

02:14:25.948 --> 02:14:27.537
TALIESIN: I'm having bad rolls for this stuff,
man.

02:14:27.537 --> 02:14:29.758
MATT: Better to get them out of the way now,
then.

02:14:29.758 --> 02:14:32.866
TALIESIN: So that didn't work.

02:14:32.866 --> 02:14:36.163
LAURA: Damn it. Good try. Good try, Percy.

02:14:36.163 --> 02:14:38.940
MARISHA: I'm trying to figure out a way we could
just conserve the acid, like if I could--

02:14:38.940 --> 02:14:40.930
TALIESIN: I'm just going to pour very gingerly.

02:14:40.930 --> 02:14:42.183
MARISHA: Okay, yeah.

02:14:42.183 --> 02:14:43.633
TALIESIN: I'm going to just pay attention.

02:14:43.633 --> 02:14:44.858
MARISHA: Okay, try it gingerly.

02:14:44.858 --> 02:14:46.535
SAM: And when he attacks us, what do we do?

02:14:46.535 --> 02:14:49.183
LAURA: Okay, yes. Good-- Good thinking.

02:14:49.183 --> 02:14:51.507
MARISHA: Are we going to fight him now or are we
going to try and run? Are we going to try and lure

02:14:51.507 --> 02:14:53.361
our way--

02:14:53.361 --> 02:14:54.835
LAURA: Stay up top as long as possible?

02:14:54.835 --> 02:14:57.733
ORION: If you're talking about fighting K'Varn in
his lair, when he attacks you--

02:14:57.733 --> 02:15:00.753
LAURA: We're not going into-- What if we can just
attack from the roof?

02:15:00.753 --> 02:15:02.337
From the opening in the roof.

02:15:02.337 --> 02:15:05.311
LIAM: Your plan is to lead the charge into
K'Varn's lair. That's what you're saying. Do I

02:15:05.311 --> 02:15:06.756
have that correctly?

02:15:06.756 --> 02:15:07.740
(laughter)

02:15:07.740 --> 02:15:08.755
ORION: Absolutely not, Vax.

02:15:08.755 --> 02:15:10.930
LAURA: Is that possible? Can we attack from the
roof, from the opening in the ceiling? Can we

02:15:10.930 --> 02:15:12.841
attack him from up there? We don't have to go in.

02:15:12.841 --> 02:15:14.326
ORION: Possibly, yes.

02:15:14.326 --> 02:15:20.061
MATT: Kima gives a nod to that and is like, "I'm
useless at that range, but we have a few members

02:15:20.079 --> 02:15:22.175
"of the party that excel at that."

02:15:22.175 --> 02:15:30.769
LAURA: Maybe we drop the thing, attack from above
as long as possible, and hope the illithid attack him.

02:15:30.769 --> 02:15:34.275
TRAVIS: Sorry. One last question. So his eye
cancels out magic, right?

02:15:34.275 --> 02:15:35.296
TALIESIN: Yeah.

02:15:35.296 --> 02:15:39.026
TRAVIS: So the more places we make him look, the
more of a chance we have to get it away from the

02:15:39.026 --> 02:15:40.249
magic users, right?

02:15:40.249 --> 02:15:41.330
LAURA AND TALIESIN: Yes.

02:15:41.330 --> 02:15:43.815
TRAVIS: So instead of just two people, why don't
we do all three? If there are two doors, and the

02:15:43.815 --> 02:15:48.075
skylight, why don't we have three teams so he has
to pick which one he looks at?

02:15:48.075 --> 02:15:50.713
LAURA: Nobody go in the temple, everybody attack
from outside.

02:15:50.713 --> 02:15:56.154
TRAVIS: I mean, I can take one of the doors at the
bottom and try and keep people from coming in.

02:15:56.452 --> 02:15:59.124
TALIESIN: That's a really-- That's a really good
idea, actually.

02:15:59.124 --> 02:16:04.737
MATT: Clarota pipes up and says, "The two other
doors are accessible from only within the temple.

02:16:04.811 --> 02:16:11.388
"If you had two parties to enter the two other
doors, they would have to go through the entire

02:16:11.388 --> 02:16:18.554
"subfloor, find a way up, which you're welcome to
try, but who knows."

02:16:18.554 --> 02:16:22.221
LAURA: Oh, I was thinking it was just like a giant
pyramid, with one roof.

02:16:22.221 --> 02:16:24.151
(laughter)

02:16:24.151 --> 02:16:25.242
ORION: That would be the best-case scenario.

02:16:25.242 --> 02:16:26.888
LAURA: That makes so much sense, though, that it's
not.

02:16:26.888 --> 02:16:28.024
(laughter)

02:16:28.024 --> 02:16:31.889
TALIESIN: To be fair, traditionally, that's very
similar to how pyramids are built.

02:16:31.889 --> 02:16:33.507
TRAVIS: Okay, what else were you going to say?

02:16:33.507 --> 02:16:36.034
MATT: That was all Clarota had to add to that.

02:16:36.034 --> 02:16:37.744
TALIESIN: It was a good thought.

02:16:37.744 --> 02:16:43.914
MARISHA: We could still take a similar approach
and just have-- We've already decided we're going

02:16:43.914 --> 02:16:52.962
to have two teams to be on two separate ends to do
the slidey-- The hingey maneuver. And then have a

02:16:52.962 --> 02:16:56.390
third team that's K'Varn distraction duty.

02:16:56.390 --> 02:17:00.484
LAURA: Yeah. Oh god.

02:17:00.484 --> 02:17:05.103
ASHLEY: Do we do distraction duty? Maybe people
who have really high--

02:17:05.103 --> 02:17:09.581
LAURA: So this is the beam. And we're going to
attack this one and this one, yeah?

02:17:09.581 --> 02:17:11.128
MARISHA: Right, so if--

02:17:11.128 --> 02:17:13.066
SAM: We're effed.

02:17:13.066 --> 02:17:18.480
MARISHA: So we've got this pyramid. And there's
this cross beam, you said, right Matt?

02:17:18.480 --> 02:17:19.481
MATT: Yep.

02:17:19.481 --> 02:17:21.567
LAURA: Oh, is it like that? Oh god, I'm picturing
it so fucking different.

02:17:21.567 --> 02:17:24.036
MARISHA: And there's this top of it, which is
open.

02:17:24.036 --> 02:17:25.967
LAURA: Okay.

02:17:25.967 --> 02:17:27.572
MARISHA: So this is the pyramid.

02:17:27.572 --> 02:17:28.835
LAURA: Yeah yeah yeah.

02:17:28.835 --> 02:17:31.733
MARISHA: You can see. And then the thing is, if
you can see through it,

02:17:31.733 --> 02:17:33.751
the thing is hanging down.

02:17:33.751 --> 02:17:34.887
LAURA: Like that.

02:17:34.887 --> 02:17:36.215
MARISHA: And it looks, it's all spirally.

02:17:36.215 --> 02:17:37.231
LAURA: Okay.

02:17:37.231 --> 02:17:38.030
MARISHA: And then here is--

02:17:38.030 --> 02:17:38.847
LAURA: The Elder Brain.

02:17:38.847 --> 02:17:39.644
MARISHA: The Elder Brain.

02:17:39.644 --> 02:17:41.002
ORION: And where's beholder-face?

02:17:41.002 --> 02:17:42.403
MARISHA: Somewhere in here!

02:17:42.403 --> 02:17:46.605
LAURA: So we're going for one side of it.

02:17:46.605 --> 02:17:47.800
MARISHA: So if we go for--

02:17:47.800 --> 02:17:50.380
LAURA: And it hopefully goes--

02:17:50.380 --> 02:17:53.194
TALIESIN: I'm just going to keep breaking-- I'm
just going to keep

02:17:53.194 --> 02:17:54.918
breaking hinges until it swings.

02:17:54.918 --> 02:17:55.996
LAURA: Okay.

02:17:55.996 --> 02:17:58.067
TRAVIS: Is anybody interested in going underneath
the pyramid with me?

02:17:58.067 --> 02:18:00.199
TALIESIN: You? Technically, you could really go
underneath it.

02:18:00.199 --> 02:18:04.563
LAURA: I feel like you'll be fighting a lot more
things. I think it's better to just go from the

02:18:04.563 --> 02:18:07.053
top, and drop in if we have to.

02:18:07.053 --> 02:18:08.207
TRAVIS: Okay.

02:18:08.207 --> 02:18:10.574
MARISHA: Drop in if we have to and, yeah.

02:18:10.574 --> 02:18:12.751
TRAVIS: And just scatter to different areas so he
has to look around.

02:18:12.751 --> 02:18:15.034
TALIESIN: Keep him looking around.

02:18:15.034 --> 02:18:16.466
TRAVIS: We can't stay together.

02:18:16.466 --> 02:18:19.212
TALIESIN: And remember that, if you don't use
magic, and especially you have one magic attack,

02:18:19.212 --> 02:18:22.904
don't try and use magic when the main eye is on
you.

02:18:22.904 --> 02:18:24.958
TRAVIS: No no. Yeah. Butthole only.

02:18:24.958 --> 02:18:29.532
ASHLEY: All right. Are we going up?

02:18:29.532 --> 02:18:31.669
TALIESIN: Let's. I think we should try this.

02:18:31.669 --> 02:18:36.981
MARISHA: So, okay okay, hang on. What happens if
this starts going poorly?

02:18:36.981 --> 02:18:38.418
LAURA: Then we run.

02:18:38.418 --> 02:18:39.567
TRAVIS: Which it's bound to do.

02:18:39.567 --> 02:18:40.773
LAURA: We run away.

02:18:40.773 --> 02:18:46.683
ORION: Actually, if everything starts going amiss,
I will make the call. Follow me and I will get out

02:18:46.683 --> 02:18:48.360
of here as soon as possible.

02:18:48.360 --> 02:18:51.661
LAURA: How will we follow you if you're on a
carpet and we're standing on a thing, and--

02:18:51.661 --> 02:18:53.334
MARISHA: Or if you're dead?

02:18:53.334 --> 02:18:54.979
TRAVIS: Yeah, we're all in different places.

02:18:54.979 --> 02:18:57.593
ORION: If I'm dead, then I'm afraid none of you
will survive.

02:18:57.593 --> 02:19:02.139
TRAVIS: But if we're all around the room, let's
say we've got in there and it's fallen off and

02:19:02.139 --> 02:19:05.801
we're all around the thing. You can't all whip us
out of there. We have to be in one area, right?

02:19:05.801 --> 02:19:07.589
ORION: What?

02:19:07.589 --> 02:19:08.943
LAURA: Yeah, okay.

02:19:08.943 --> 02:19:10.518
ASHLEY: We all have to be in one area.

02:19:10.518 --> 02:19:11.893
ORION: We have to be on the carpet? Is that a
carpet joke?

02:19:11.893 --> 02:19:15.817
TRAVIS: No no no. I was asking, you can't teleport
a room out, we have to be together, right?

02:19:15.817 --> 02:19:19.580
ORION: I can make a portal that we can all step in
and bamf to--

02:19:19.580 --> 02:19:21.640
TRAVIS: But we have to be near you, right?

02:19:21.640 --> 02:19:24.181
ORION: We have to be where I cast it, yes. Yeah.

02:19:24.181 --> 02:19:25.988
TALIESIN: So if he makes the portal, you have to
get to the portal.

02:19:25.988 --> 02:19:27.192
ORION: Yes.

02:19:27.192 --> 02:19:28.528
TRAVIS: We might not have that luxury.

02:19:28.528 --> 02:19:29.506
TALIESIN: We might not.

02:19:29.506 --> 02:19:32.799
MARISHA: Should we have a safe location?

02:19:32.799 --> 02:19:37.146
TRAVIS: Should we have a run-away word, a safety
word, like Oklahoma, or something?

02:19:37.146 --> 02:19:40.844
TALIESIN: How about "Oh god, we're all going to
die. Run away, run away right now. My god, my god,

02:19:41.084 --> 02:19:42.743
"we're all going to die"?

02:19:42.743 --> 02:19:45.056
ORION: Oh, Percy, yes. I believe it's this.

02:19:45.056 --> 02:19:46.897
TALIESIN: Yes, we'll do this.

02:19:46.897 --> 02:19:48.490
ORION: I'll do the signal.

02:19:48.490 --> 02:19:50.038
SAM: Just to clarify.

02:19:50.038 --> 02:19:51.155
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:19:51.155 --> 02:19:55.517
SAM: Before we go. I am dropping a giant mouse in
there, right?

02:19:55.517 --> 02:19:56.783
LAURA AND TALIESIN: Yes.

02:19:56.783 --> 02:19:57.741
TRAVIS: You are.

02:19:57.741 --> 02:19:58.810
SAM: Okay.

02:19:58.810 --> 02:20:00.678
ASHLEY: Going up on a Thursday!

02:20:00.678 --> 02:20:03.133
LAURA: Oh god. Okay, so, are we doing it?

02:20:03.133 --> 02:20:04.992
SAM: Come on, let's go have some fun!

02:20:04.992 --> 02:20:06.959
TALIESIN: He's just sitting here, laughing.

02:20:06.959 --> 02:20:13.707
MATT: Kima lobs her maul on her shoulder and gives
you a look and says, "Yes, this day we save

02:20:13.707 --> 02:20:21.019
"Kraghammer, Cliffkeep Mountains, and quite
possibly, the future of Tal'Dorei. But if we fall,

02:20:21.019 --> 02:20:25.488
"others will come to try and finish our journey."

02:20:25.488 --> 02:20:27.062
SAM: Good pep talk.

02:20:27.062 --> 02:20:34.408
MATT: "Either way, we do this as heroes, we do
this together, for Vox Machina."

02:20:34.408 --> 02:20:35.800
SAM: Ooh.

02:20:35.800 --> 02:20:38.267
MATT: She puts her hand out in the center.

02:20:38.267 --> 02:20:44.116
SAM: Oh, Kima. Clarota, are you going to put
your--

02:20:44.116 --> 02:20:53.568
MATT: Clarota slowly hovers towards the center.

02:20:53.568 --> 02:20:55.957
LAURA: Yeah, Clarota.

02:20:55.957 --> 02:20:57.464
ASHLEY: And Trinket?

02:20:57.464 --> 02:21:02.488
MATT: These terrible, long, lanky fingers almost
wrap around the cluster of hands at the top. Cold

02:21:02.488 --> 02:21:06.464
and nasty. Trinket comes up and nuzzles in the
center.

02:21:06.464 --> 02:21:08.474
LAURA: Oh, good.

02:21:08.474 --> 02:21:11.103
MATT: Kima, once more, says, "For Vox Machina!"

02:21:11.103 --> 02:21:13.177
ALL: Vox Machina!

02:21:13.177 --> 02:21:16.681
SAM: We're a well-oiled machine.

02:21:16.681 --> 02:21:18.814
LIAM: Let's go do the stupidest thing we've ever
done.

02:21:18.814 --> 02:21:20.202
MARISHA: Grog, what are you thinking over there?

02:21:20.202 --> 02:21:21.220
SAM: How are we getting there?

02:21:21.220 --> 02:21:22.540
TRAVIS: So, one problem is-- We're still coming
in--

02:21:22.540 --> 02:21:23.398
SAM: (groans)

02:21:23.398 --> 02:21:25.051
TRAVIS: I know, I know. We're all still coming in
through one area, though. It's like the fatal

02:21:25.051 --> 02:21:27.879
funnel. It's like a doorway. If you all come in
through the doorway, you're all in one spot.

02:21:27.879 --> 02:21:29.586
SAM: It's also an easy way out.

02:21:29.586 --> 02:21:33.570
MARISHA: It worked for the Spartans in that
awesome 300 comic.

02:21:33.570 --> 02:21:37.794
TRAVIS: This guy has, like, 12 dick-finger eyes.
It's all bad. It's all bad.

02:21:37.794 --> 02:21:39.444
ASHLEY: Dick-finger eyes?

02:21:39.444 --> 02:21:42.707
TRAVIS: All right.

02:21:42.707 --> 02:21:46.022
MARISHA: Shut up. It was awesome in the comic.

02:21:46.022 --> 02:21:49.117
MATT: So, what is the process, here?

02:21:49.117 --> 02:21:50.524
ASHLEY: What is the plan?

02:21:50.524 --> 02:21:53.712
LAURA: Question. When you guys were flying
overhead, the top of the temple is wide enough for

02:21:53.712 --> 02:21:55.249
us to stand on, yeah?

02:21:55.249 --> 02:22:00.630
MARISHA: It's got a massive cross beam supporting
a giant arch structure.

02:22:00.630 --> 02:22:04.699
MATT: It's about, I'd say, 20 foot by 20 foot.

02:22:04.699 --> 02:22:05.667
ORION: So yes.

02:22:05.667 --> 02:22:08.624
MATT: So it's a pretty wide square. Enough for all
you guys.

02:22:08.624 --> 02:22:10.532
LAURA: Can we stand on the wall of the temple?

02:22:10.532 --> 02:22:11.940
MATT: Oh yeah, there's like a five-foot wall on
the edge.

02:22:11.940 --> 02:22:12.948
LAURA: Okay, okay.

02:22:12.948 --> 02:22:14.965
SAM: I have one more plan, just to throw it out
there.

02:22:14.965 --> 02:22:16.046
TRAVIS: I'm all ears.

02:22:16.046 --> 02:22:18.976
SAM: Just occurred to me. It just occurred to me.

02:22:18.976 --> 02:22:20.509
LAURA: Okay.

02:22:20.509 --> 02:22:26.634
SAM: It could get us into the temple a different
way, but not into the chamber.

02:22:26.634 --> 02:22:27.840
TRAVIS: Okay.

02:22:27.840 --> 02:22:31.442
SAM: I could make us all look like illithids.

02:22:31.442 --> 02:22:32.797
TALIESIN: They're psychic.

02:22:32.797 --> 02:22:34.744
TRAVIS: He'll read our minds. He's already in our
heads.

02:22:34.744 --> 02:22:37.707
SAM: He could read our minds but we'll be
outside.

02:22:37.707 --> 02:22:44.546
MATT: Clarota turns to you slowly and says,
piercing in your mind with a force of honesty and

02:22:44.546 --> 02:22:50.745
almost condescending essence, "You will make it
ten feet before the

02:22:50.745 --> 02:22:53.738
"brain is pulled from your skull."

02:22:53.738 --> 02:22:55.450
ORION: So that's a no.

02:22:55.450 --> 02:23:01.222
SAM: Typically, it's "Yes, and," Clarota, but all
right.

02:23:01.222 --> 02:23:04.440
(laughter)

02:23:04.440 --> 02:23:08.794
SAM: All right, all right. Good, then let's just
go divebomb with a big mouse.

02:23:08.794 --> 02:23:12.275
TRAVIS: No, I-- All right.

02:23:12.275 --> 02:23:14.613
ASHLEY: This. Is. Vox Machina!

02:23:14.613 --> 02:23:16.254
MARISHA: Yeah!

02:23:16.254 --> 02:23:18.181
TALIESIN: We do have a thousand-foot Teleport.

02:23:18.181 --> 02:23:20.950
MARISHA: I mean, Grog.

02:23:20.950 --> 02:23:22.544
MATT: The Fomorian stands up.

02:23:22.544 --> 02:23:25.032
TALIESIN: Grog, for ground forces we do have a
thousand-foot Teleport. So we could actually bring

02:23:25.032 --> 02:23:26.570
you into the room.

02:23:26.570 --> 02:23:30.630
MARISHA: If it gets to a point where we want to go
in, I will go in underneath with you. I'll do my

02:23:30.630 --> 02:23:32.363
earth elemental thing.

02:23:32.363 --> 02:23:34.953
TRAVIS: Yeah, anything that'll just split up where
he looks. That's all I wanna do.

02:23:34.953 --> 02:23:36.949
MARISHA: I'll go with you if it gets to that
point.

02:23:36.949 --> 02:23:38.083
TRAVIS: Okay.

02:23:38.083 --> 02:23:49.204
MATT: The Fomorian stands up with his club and
looks to you and says, in Undercommon, "What do

02:23:49.298 --> 02:23:50.900
"you need?"

02:23:50.900 --> 02:23:57.770
SAM: What are we telling the-- Hey, hey! What are
we telling the giant to do? Knock the cross or

02:23:57.770 --> 02:23:58.970
attack K'Varn?

02:23:58.970 --> 02:24:00.931
LAURA: Attack the beholder when it's dropped
there.

02:24:00.931 --> 02:24:08.181
MARISHA: Well, right now, you are going to be
mouse.

02:24:08.181 --> 02:24:10.460
TRAVIS: Good, good.

02:24:10.460 --> 02:24:21.431
MARISHA: And then-- Wait for me to finish my
thought. Stay with me. And then, you fight K'Varn.

02:24:21.431 --> 02:24:26.129
You kill beholder.

02:24:26.129 --> 02:24:29.134
LAURA: Eat. Food. Big eyeball.

02:24:29.134 --> 02:24:32.788
MARISHA: Eat food. Yes, delicacy.

02:24:32.788 --> 02:24:38.053
MATT: Licks the side of his giant club, which you
can see is covered in this horrible mixture of

02:24:38.053 --> 02:24:45.219
moss and rotting entrails from whatever he smashed
the other evening. Licks it off, and goes, "Eat.

02:24:45.219 --> 02:24:53.052
"All right." (grunts) Like slams his chest.

02:24:53.052 --> 02:24:54.665
SAM: I make him a mouse.

02:24:54.665 --> 02:24:57.056
(laughter)

02:24:57.056 --> 02:24:59.366
ORION: There he is!

02:24:59.366 --> 02:25:02.135
LAURA: Oh my gosh, Tiny, you're tiny!

02:25:02.135 --> 02:25:06.051
MATT: Most confused-looking mouse you've ever
seen. If there could be an expression of, "What

02:25:06.051 --> 02:25:08.070
"the fuck?" on a mouse, it's on that one.

02:25:08.070 --> 02:25:10.219
LAURA: He still smells really, really bad.

02:25:10.219 --> 02:25:13.059
LIAM: Who's throwing-- Who's throwing him?

02:25:13.059 --> 02:25:15.270
LAURA: Oh, I'll just keep him with me.

02:25:15.270 --> 02:25:16.621
ASHLEY: I scratch him behind his ears.

02:25:16.621 --> 02:25:17.656
SAM: All right, let's go.

02:25:17.656 --> 02:25:18.825
MATT: Who's on the carpet?

02:25:18.825 --> 02:25:21.060
LIAM: The way we always do it, don't we? Don't the
gnomes fly--

02:25:21.060 --> 02:25:22.287
LAURA: Yeah.

02:25:22.287 --> 02:25:23.418
LIAM: Bird-style.

02:25:23.418 --> 02:25:24.678
SAM: How does Grog get anywhere? I forget.

02:25:24.678 --> 02:25:26.301
LAURA: Are we going to Polymorph Grog?

02:25:26.301 --> 02:25:28.284
TRAVIS: No no. You Levitate me, right?

02:25:28.284 --> 02:25:32.354
ORION: No, I cast Fly on him and I hop on his
back.

02:25:32.354 --> 02:25:34.704
MATT: All right.

02:25:34.704 --> 02:25:36.621
(laughter)

02:25:36.621 --> 02:25:39.494
MATT: I'll allow it.

02:25:39.494 --> 02:25:41.223
ORION: This time you can see.

02:25:41.223 --> 02:25:42.767
TRAVIS: That's true!

02:25:42.767 --> 02:25:44.441
ORION: This should be a lot smoother.

02:25:44.441 --> 02:25:46.207
LIAM: Okay, so Percy, Vex, Vax on the flying
carpet.

02:25:46.207 --> 02:25:47.441
LAURA: And Trinket.

02:25:47.441 --> 02:25:48.713
MARISHA: I'll be on the carpet.

02:25:48.713 --> 02:25:49.448
SAM: Us too.

02:25:49.448 --> 02:25:51.409
MATT: Trinket can't be on the carpet. Trinket's
too heavy for the carpet.

02:25:51.409 --> 02:25:53.514
LAURA: Can anybody shrink Trinket, too?

02:25:53.514 --> 02:25:56.069
SAM: Is Trinket worth it?

02:25:56.069 --> 02:25:58.452
(laughter)

02:25:58.452 --> 02:26:00.700
LAURA: Scanlan. Scanlan.

02:26:00.700 --> 02:26:02.604
SAM: There's just a limited number of spells.

02:26:02.604 --> 02:26:04.441
ORION: Oh no he didn't.

02:26:04.441 --> 02:26:06.767
TALIESIN: Wow.

02:26:06.767 --> 02:26:11.128
SAM: Of course Trinket is worth it. I was saying--
I was being Bizarro Scanlan.

02:26:11.128 --> 02:26:14.712
LAURA: Yeah. Who can shrink my bear?

02:26:14.712 --> 02:26:16.626
MATT: Keyleth, are you hawk, carrying the gnomes?

02:26:16.626 --> 02:26:19.621
MARISHA: No, we're all magic carpeting.

02:26:19.621 --> 02:26:20.666
LIAM: No, we can't all fit.

02:26:20.666 --> 02:26:22.272
MATT: You can fit six people on the carpet.

02:26:22.272 --> 02:26:24.459
LIAM: This is what we always do. You carry the
gnomes--

02:26:24.459 --> 02:26:28.932
LAURA: Can you cast Fly on Trinket and ride him?
I'll ride him, if somebody casts Fly on him.

02:26:28.932 --> 02:26:34.164
MARISHA: Can we-- Here's the thing. If I turn into
a hawk, I won't be able to turn into an earth

02:26:34.164 --> 02:26:35.482
elemental.

02:26:35.482 --> 02:26:37.029
TRAVIS: We don't want to sacrifice that.

02:26:37.029 --> 02:26:38.199
LAURA: No.

02:26:38.199 --> 02:26:41.573
TALIESIN: Why don't we-- Is it possible to drop
off a group and then go back and get the rest?

02:26:41.573 --> 02:26:42.850
A taxi?

02:26:42.850 --> 02:26:44.842
TRAVIS: Yeah, why not? Can we make two trips?

02:26:44.842 --> 02:26:47.710
ASHLEY: We have two carpets, now. Matt?

02:26:47.710 --> 02:26:49.270
(laughter)

02:26:49.270 --> 02:26:51.029
ASHLEY: We have two carpets, now.

02:26:51.029 --> 02:26:53.200
MATT: No.

02:26:53.200 --> 02:26:54.256
(laughter)

02:26:54.256 --> 02:26:55.840
MATT: It doesn't work that way.

02:26:55.840 --> 02:26:56.777
ASHLEY: I tried.

02:26:56.777 --> 02:26:57.914
TALIESIN: It was such a good try.

02:26:57.914 --> 02:27:01.185
TRAVIS: We have-- We have two carpets. Two
carpets.

02:27:01.185 --> 02:27:02.798
ASHLEY: We have two carpets.

02:27:02.798 --> 02:27:05.709
MATT: Boulder falls, smashes party.

02:27:05.709 --> 02:27:07.392
(laughter)

02:27:07.392 --> 02:27:09.163
MATT: All right, so.

02:27:09.163 --> 02:27:12.680
TRAVIS: We're going to make two trips and come
back for seconds. Okay.

02:27:12.680 --> 02:27:15.120
ORION: Two trips, wait what? Why?

02:27:15.120 --> 02:27:17.512
MATT: So, first shift is--

02:27:17.512 --> 02:27:22.232
MARISHA: The stealthiest.

02:27:22.232 --> 02:27:26.433
SAM: Don't take offense, but we can leave Kima.
She can't do anything for us up here. She has no

02:27:26.433 --> 02:27:31.593
ranged attacks, she's useless. In a sexy way.

02:27:31.593 --> 02:27:33.829
LAURA: That's not a compliment, Scanlan.

02:27:33.829 --> 02:27:38.444
MATT: Kima looks you dead in the face and says,
"Regardless of what your plans are, I'm bringing

02:27:38.444 --> 02:27:43.062
"this hammer onto the head of that foul
abomination."

02:27:43.062 --> 02:27:44.223
TRAVIS: Yeah, she means it.

02:27:44.223 --> 02:27:46.129
ORION: Yes, of course, but outside, here with me.

02:27:46.129 --> 02:27:53.135
MATT: "I know I will not survive this. But I will
be damned if I don't dent its face before I go."

02:27:53.135 --> 02:27:55.337
TALIESIN: Which is why we're picking you up in the
second group.

02:27:55.337 --> 02:28:02.726
ORION: And, Lady Kima, you must survive. Because
you must tell Allura of my deeds. For no

02:28:02.726 --> 02:28:04.094
particular reason.

02:28:04.094 --> 02:28:06.053
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's not like you'll be there to
collect.

02:28:06.053 --> 02:28:07.139
MATT: "Noted."

02:28:07.139 --> 02:28:08.796
TRAVIS: On the, you know, props. If you die.

02:28:08.796 --> 02:28:14.515
MATT: "Second trip. First, be quiet."

02:28:14.515 --> 02:28:16.517
TALIESIN: Yes. Stealth, stealth.

02:28:16.517 --> 02:28:18.057
MARISHA: Stealth people first.

02:28:18.057 --> 02:28:19.606
ASHLEY: Stealthy should go first, and that's not
me.

02:28:19.606 --> 02:28:20.902
TRAVIS: And we'll fly the carpet back.

02:28:20.902 --> 02:28:22.228
LAURA: You promise you'll take care of Trinket if
I go--

02:28:22.228 --> 02:28:24.449
TRAVIS: Right. So we'll fly. And then we'll fly
the carpet back.

02:28:24.449 --> 02:28:29.139
LAURA: Can Trinket go in a smaller group? He'll
fit on the carpet if there's a smaller group?

02:28:29.139 --> 02:28:31.066
MATT: Too heavy, unfortunately. It's a big bear.

02:28:31.066 --> 02:28:33.419
LIAM: How's he going to get from the top of the
pyramid down in? Maybe he should hide here and

02:28:33.419 --> 02:28:36.219
live to tell our story.

02:28:36.219 --> 02:28:41.427
TRAVIS: He's going to drop me off on the first
trip, take Fly off of me, he'll get on the carpet,

02:28:41.427 --> 02:28:43.421
come back for the second group, and Fly Trinket.

02:28:43.421 --> 02:28:46.793
ORION: No, you'll keep Fly up. Because I can just
hop on the carpet.

02:28:46.793 --> 02:28:50.268
TRAVIS: That's what I mean, once I'm up on the
temple, you take it off of me. And then you can

02:28:50.268 --> 02:28:52.772
put it on Trinket, because I'll be chilling on the
top.

02:28:52.772 --> 02:28:53.944
LAURA: But that's casting it twice.

02:28:53.944 --> 02:28:55.004
ORION: I'm casting it twice.

02:28:55.004 --> 02:28:55.901
TRAVIS: Which you can't do?

02:28:55.901 --> 02:28:57.051
ORION: But Trinket can get on the carpet.

02:28:57.051 --> 02:28:58.560
LAURA: No, he can't ride the carpet, we just said
that.

02:28:58.560 --> 02:29:01.379
TALIESIN: Trinket should stay with the boat as
opposed to fighting the beholder.

02:29:01.379 --> 02:29:02.733
ORION: He needs a diet.

02:29:02.733 --> 02:29:06.304
TALIESIN: Those are your options, is Trinket
fights a beholder, or Trinket stays.

02:29:06.304 --> 02:29:08.143
MATT: As you're having this discussion, Trinket
comes over.

02:29:08.143 --> 02:29:09.211
LAURA: Trinket.

02:29:09.211 --> 02:29:15.236
MATT: Rubs his nose along you, and gives you a look
of, like a very stern stance of, essentially, the

02:29:15.315 --> 02:29:17.980
feeling is Trinket wants to be by your side for
this.

02:29:17.980 --> 02:29:20.132
LAURA: Yeah, Trinket wants to be by my side, you
guys.

02:29:20.132 --> 02:29:24.623
TRAVIS: How the fuck do we get him up there?

02:29:24.623 --> 02:29:26.196
ASHLEY: All right, who's on the first carpet?

02:29:26.196 --> 02:29:30.113
MARISHA: Someone's burning a spell, or we're going
in shifts. One of the two.

02:29:30.113 --> 02:29:31.666
TRAVIS: We are doing shifts, right?

02:29:31.666 --> 02:29:32.537
TALIESIN: Yeah.

02:29:32.537 --> 02:29:35.093
LAURA: We don't need to if we burn a spell,
because Trinket's the one that can't fit on the

02:29:35.093 --> 02:29:37.773
carpet in the first place. Everybody else can fit
on, right?

02:29:37.773 --> 02:29:39.417
MATT: Mm-hm.

02:29:39.417 --> 02:29:41.219
MARISHA: So we're picking one, rather.
Polymorphing Trinket--

02:29:41.219 --> 02:29:42.489
ORION: Wait a minute, hold on.

02:29:42.489 --> 02:29:43.535
MARISHA: Or we're casting Fly on him.

02:29:43.535 --> 02:29:47.885
ORION: Hold on a tick. How much can you lift,
Grog?

02:29:47.885 --> 02:29:50.955
TRAVIS: I mean, I weight 645 pounds, so a lot.

02:29:50.955 --> 02:29:52.280
ORION: So a shit-ton.

02:29:52.280 --> 02:29:56.948
MATT: Grog is not strong enough to carry a bear
and you on a Fly spell.

02:29:56.948 --> 02:29:58.456
MARISHA: What if we cast Fly on the bear?

02:29:58.456 --> 02:29:59.758
ORION: No no no. I mean one at a time.

02:29:59.758 --> 02:30:01.177
ASHLEY: It's a good idea, though.

02:30:01.177 --> 02:30:04.108
SAM: We're still doing shifts then.

02:30:04.207 --> 02:30:07.448
MATT: You can try. There's a good chance he might
drop Trinket on the way over. From that height,

02:30:07.448 --> 02:30:08.786
which would be a splatter bear.

02:30:08.786 --> 02:30:11.513
MARISHA: Can you cast Fly on Trinket and then have
Grog ride Trinket?

02:30:11.513 --> 02:30:13.811
SAM: It's the same issue.

02:30:13.811 --> 02:30:15.501
MARISHA: Is that the same problem?

02:30:15.501 --> 02:30:17.568
ASHLEY: What if one of us ride Trinket?

02:30:17.568 --> 02:30:19.963
LAURA: Well, but Grog won't fit on the flying
carpet. This is a really--

02:30:19.963 --> 02:30:21.740
This is like a mind puzzle.

02:30:21.740 --> 02:30:22.981
MATT: Kind of, yeah.

02:30:22.981 --> 02:30:25.627
ASHLEY: How long does it take to make the trip?

02:30:25.627 --> 02:30:28.679
MATT: From flying over there on the carpet, at its
full speed--

02:30:28.679 --> 02:30:30.272
LIAM: Scanlan and I flew over there.

02:30:30.272 --> 02:30:32.285
MATT: I'd say it'd take about 20 minutes or so.

02:30:32.285 --> 02:30:33.378
LAURA: 20 minutes?

02:30:33.378 --> 02:30:34.884
SAM: To fly a mile?

02:30:34.884 --> 02:30:36.050
MATT: 15 minutes.

02:30:36.050 --> 02:30:37.141
ORION: I cast Fly on Trinket.

02:30:37.141 --> 02:30:38.391
MATT: The carpet isn't extremely fast.

02:30:38.391 --> 02:30:41.700
ORION: Oh, wait. And I'll do that. I'll wait,
because I can only do it one at a time. So I'll

02:30:41.700 --> 02:30:42.996
burn it for him.

02:30:42.996 --> 02:30:43.503
TRAVIS: Okay.

02:30:43.503 --> 02:30:44.652
ORION: Let's go.

02:30:44.652 --> 02:30:45.481
TRAVIS: Let's do it.

02:30:45.481 --> 02:30:46.196
SAM: Wait, what did you do?

02:30:46.196 --> 02:30:48.876
ORION: I'll burn it for Trinket. The Fly.

02:30:48.876 --> 02:30:50.448
LAURA: So we can both Fly?

02:30:50.448 --> 02:30:51.758
MARISHA: So we can all Fly?

02:30:51.758 --> 02:30:52.882
ORION: Not right now. No.

02:30:52.882 --> 02:30:54.011
MATT: All right. So.

02:30:54.011 --> 02:30:58.353
ORION: We'll go up first, then I'll come back down
with the carpet, I'll cast Fly on him and whoever is--

02:30:58.353 --> 02:31:08.290
MATT: So, first batch. Vex, Vax, Percy, Scanlan,
Grog is flying. All right. Grog's there.

02:31:08.290 --> 02:31:09.331
SAM: You're staying?

02:31:09.331 --> 02:31:10.245
ORION: I'll stay down with Trinket.

02:31:10.245 --> 02:31:11.619
MARISHA: Who else can go, is there room for one
more?

02:31:11.619 --> 02:31:12.712
ORION: Because I don't need to go up.

02:31:12.712 --> 02:31:13.805
SAM: Oh, what are Kima and Clarota--

02:31:13.805 --> 02:31:16.394
ASHLEY: They're hanging out with Pike.

02:31:16.394 --> 02:31:19.284
MATT: And, we'll say Clarota will go with you guys
because Clarota can stealth. Kima will stay back.

02:31:19.284 --> 02:31:23.673
LAURA: I cast Pass Without a Trace on the entire
party, before we all take off.

02:31:23.673 --> 02:31:30.449
MATT: Good. All right. As you guys all continue
forward. Let's see. Keyleth,

02:31:30.449 --> 02:31:31.919
are you going with them?

02:31:31.919 --> 02:31:32.963
MARISHA: No. I stay behind.

02:31:32.963 --> 02:31:33.884
MATT: All right.

02:31:33.884 --> 02:31:41.861
SAM: I'm going to, in front of us, using Minor
Illusion, I'm just going to create a floating bald

02:31:41.861 --> 02:31:45.098
eagle thing to distract the bats with.

02:31:45.098 --> 02:31:46.953
MATT: Okay.

02:31:46.953 --> 02:31:48.688
SAM: It's just flying around.

02:31:48.688 --> 02:31:52.101
MATT: Everyone on the carpet make a stealth check.
Clarota goes invisible.

02:31:52.101 --> 02:31:54.214
TALIESIN: What's the bonus for Pass Without a
Trace?

02:31:54.214 --> 02:31:55.231
ORION: Plus ten.

02:31:55.231 --> 02:31:57.870
TRAVIS: 21.

02:31:57.870 --> 02:31:59.403
SAM: Stealth isn't dexterity, is it?

02:31:59.403 --> 02:32:00.433
MATT: Hmm? Yes it is.

02:32:00.433 --> 02:32:01.611
ORION: 23.

02:32:01.611 --> 02:32:03.129
LAURA: And you add ten.

02:32:03.129 --> 02:32:06.199
SAM: 23.

02:32:06.199 --> 02:32:07.521
MATT: You add ten to it.

02:32:07.521 --> 02:32:08.449
LIAM: 36.

02:32:08.449 --> 02:32:09.369
TRAVIS: Oh, plus ten?

02:32:09.369 --> 02:32:10.239
ORION: Yeah.

02:32:10.239 --> 02:32:11.137
TRAVIS: 31.

02:32:11.137 --> 02:32:11.847
MATT: There you go.

02:32:11.847 --> 02:32:12.552
TALIESIN: 30.

02:32:12.552 --> 02:32:13.292
LAURA: 18.

02:32:13.292 --> 02:32:15.144
MATT: 18 total? All right.

02:32:15.144 --> 02:32:17.628
TRAVIS: Still alive.

02:32:17.628 --> 02:32:19.927
MATT: Okay. You guys make your way--

02:32:19.927 --> 02:32:21.432
TRAVIS: He rolled three times.

02:32:21.432 --> 02:32:22.554
MATT: -- over to the temple.

02:32:22.554 --> 02:32:23.900
SAM: The bats.

02:32:23.900 --> 02:32:30.968
MATT: The bats don't seem to take any notice of
your passage. You find your way slowly coming

02:32:30.968 --> 02:32:36.022
towards the temple. That dull, eerie green glow
towards the top. The carpet finds its way just

02:32:36.022 --> 02:32:40.927
along the edge to the point where you can safely
step off on that little five-foot-wide section of

02:32:40.927 --> 02:32:47.550
walkway that surrounds the glass top. And you do
see it. It is a relatively large, see-through,

02:32:47.550 --> 02:32:53.530
almost glass-like substance. It's hard to say. It
looks like glass. It's about a good three inches

02:32:53.530 --> 02:32:59.001
thick, and the metal beams themselves are bolted
into the stone itself.

02:32:59.001 --> 02:33:02.862
TALIESIN: They're bolted into the stone itself?

02:33:02.862 --> 02:33:04.100
MATT: Yep.

02:33:04.100 --> 02:33:07.923
TALIESIN: I would love to, while we're here, very
quietly examine--

02:33:07.923 --> 02:33:11.440
SAM: Wait, when we've arrived, is anyone going
back? No.

02:33:11.440 --> 02:33:14.859
MARISHA: Yeah, people were dropping people off.

02:33:14.859 --> 02:33:16.147
TALIESIN: Someone's going back.

02:33:16.147 --> 02:33:17.085
SAM: Who's going back?

02:33:17.085 --> 02:33:18.644
ORION: I'm staying on the carpet.

02:33:18.644 --> 02:33:19.632
TALIESIN: So he's going back.

02:33:19.632 --> 02:33:20.852
SAM: And you're going back to pick up the others?

02:33:20.852 --> 02:33:22.939
MATT: And Grog slowly flies over and meets up with
you guys.

02:33:22.939 --> 02:33:24.448
LIAM: I thought you stayed back.

02:33:24.448 --> 02:33:27.297
ORION: No, I had to go with you so I could take
the carpet back.

02:33:27.297 --> 02:33:29.520
ASHLEY: There's enough room now, for the carpet to
go back and take all of us?

02:33:29.520 --> 02:33:31.622
ORION: So I can come back with the carpet.

02:33:31.622 --> 02:33:32.323
MATT: Yeah.

02:33:32.323 --> 02:33:33.194
ORION: Because they're dropped off.

02:33:33.194 --> 02:33:34.236
LAURA: Okay, so you dropped us off.

02:33:34.236 --> 02:33:35.534
MATT: Did you roll a stealth check?

02:33:35.534 --> 02:33:36.335
ORION: Shit.

02:33:36.335 --> 02:33:37.393
LAURA: Oh no.

02:33:37.393 --> 02:33:39.891
ORION: That's 19.

02:33:39.891 --> 02:33:41.024
LAURA: Plus ten?

02:33:41.024 --> 02:33:41.830
ORION: Yeah.

02:33:41.830 --> 02:33:43.195
MATT: Yeah. Okay.

02:33:43.195 --> 02:33:44.506
ORION: Thank you.

02:33:44.506 --> 02:33:48.201
MATT: So, you guys are left at that point, now.

02:33:48.201 --> 02:33:53.699
TALIESIN: I want to examine the structure to see
if I could find the optimal place and the

02:33:53.699 --> 02:33:58.100
weaknesses in the structure. Whether or not it's
more appropriate to pour the acid on the stone,

02:33:58.100 --> 02:34:02.860
whether it's better to pour the acid on the metal.
Just to see where it would be weakest,

02:34:02.860 --> 02:34:04.033
mathematically.

02:34:04.033 --> 02:34:07.180
MATT: Go ahead and make a perception check.
Actually no, this would be investigate.

02:34:07.180 --> 02:34:08.313
TALIESIN: Investigate?

02:34:08.313 --> 02:34:09.724
MATT: Yeah.

02:34:09.724 --> 02:34:12.884
ORION: Before I leave to go back down, Vex?

02:34:12.884 --> 02:34:14.796
LAURA: Yes.

02:34:14.796 --> 02:34:17.510
ORION: When you see it, be sure to mark the
beast.

02:34:17.510 --> 02:34:18.703
TALIESIN: 19.

02:34:18.703 --> 02:34:25.824
MATT: All right. You gather, best that you can,
that the metal itself is essentially bolted

02:34:25.824 --> 02:34:32.284
overtop onto the stone. If you were to run the
acid along where the metal is overlapping and

02:34:32.284 --> 02:34:35.872
bolted down on the top, that would weaken it
significantly. The stone itself is not going to

02:34:35.872 --> 02:34:40.803
help much, but where that boundary is, where it's
essentially clamped, that area right there is

02:34:40.803 --> 02:34:43.500
going to be where you want it to put a bleed
through and coat.

02:34:43.500 --> 02:34:44.848
MARISHA: Awesome.

02:34:44.848 --> 02:34:50.129
MATT: All right, are you going back for the
others? All right. Are you guys just standing

02:34:50.129 --> 02:34:51.877
carefully on the edge?

02:34:51.877 --> 02:34:53.882
LAURA: Are we waiting?

02:34:53.882 --> 02:34:59.036
TRAVIS: We are definitely staying out of any kind
of visible sight of the giant meatball.

02:34:59.036 --> 02:35:01.984
MATT: Okay. All right. Tiberius, you head back?

02:35:01.984 --> 02:35:03.381
ORION: Yep.

02:35:03.381 --> 02:35:10.782
MATT: All right. Eventually grabbing the rest of
the group here.

02:35:10.782 --> 02:35:13.699
MARISHA: Can I go ahead and cast Pass Without a
Trace on the rest of us?

02:35:13.699 --> 02:35:15.532
MATT: All righty. Pass without a Trace, second
time. Thank god.

02:35:15.532 --> 02:35:18.822
(laughter)

02:35:18.822 --> 02:35:25.615
MATT: You cast Fly on Trinket. Which is a
hilarious sight. As this large, brown, armored

02:35:25.615 --> 02:35:30.036
bear, all of a sudden is like (confused bear
noise). It takes a good--

02:35:30.036 --> 02:35:35.207
ORION: Trinket, Trinket! Think of Vex. Go to Vex.
Go to Vex. She's up there.

02:35:35.207 --> 02:35:39.651
MATT: As you say that, Trinket, suddenly,
straightens trajectory a little bit and starts

02:35:39.651 --> 02:35:41.287
finding this awkward zig-zag.

02:35:41.287 --> 02:35:43.464
LAURA: That's so cute.

02:35:43.552 --> 02:35:46.373
MATT: But nevertheless is finding some sort of
purchase in this strange, flying environment. You

02:35:46.373 --> 02:35:50.378
can see, if a bear could have an expression, it'd
be bewilderment, confusion, and slowly trickling

02:35:50.378 --> 02:35:51.665
into joy.

02:35:51.665 --> 02:35:53.499
ORION: It's very cool.

02:35:53.499 --> 02:35:54.960
MARISHA: It's so cute.

02:35:54.960 --> 02:35:56.675
SAM: I'm flying!

02:35:56.675 --> 02:35:59.894
MATT: As you all begin to drift back over towards
the center of the city, if I can get a stealth

02:35:59.894 --> 02:36:01.935
check from everybody, including Trinket.

02:36:01.935 --> 02:36:03.278
ASHLEY: And we get a plus ten?

02:36:03.278 --> 02:36:05.668
MATT: Plus ten. Everybody on the second trip.

02:36:05.668 --> 02:36:07.158
ORION: 23.

02:36:07.158 --> 02:36:09.377
MATT: All right.

02:36:09.377 --> 02:36:11.527
MARISHA: 34.

02:36:11.527 --> 02:36:12.702
MATT: All right.

02:36:12.702 --> 02:36:13.678
ASHLEY: 39.

02:36:13.678 --> 02:36:18.661
MATT: All right. And for Trinket?

02:36:18.661 --> 02:36:21.699
LAURA: Oh, um, yeah, that's--

02:36:21.699 --> 02:36:23.937
ASHLEY: Plus ten? 16.

02:36:23.937 --> 02:36:27.940
LAURA: No, plus ten would be 11 because he rolled
a one.

02:36:27.940 --> 02:36:30.666
LIAM: I saw it.

02:36:30.666 --> 02:36:33.462
SAM: "I'm flying!"

02:36:33.462 --> 02:36:36.602
ORION: It's your first time. It's going to be a
little rough.

02:36:36.602 --> 02:36:45.309
MATT: As Trinket continues floating behind the
carpet, you hear this familiar (bat squeaks)--

02:36:45.309 --> 02:36:46.570
SAM: Bats.

02:36:46.570 --> 02:36:50.309
MATT: -- sound as a cluster of bats begin to
descend from a darkened portion over the cavern.

02:36:50.309 --> 02:36:53.573
They're about 60 feet back.

02:36:53.573 --> 02:36:55.085
ORION: How far away is it from me?

02:36:55.085 --> 02:36:56.571
MATT: About 60 feet.

02:36:56.571 --> 02:36:57.762
TRAVIS: Don't do it.

02:36:57.762 --> 02:37:08.224
MARISHA: I turn, and I, seeing the bats come in,
in bat language, in like, you know, echo (bat noises).

02:37:08.224 --> 02:37:11.260
TALIESIN: The bats say, "What are you clicking at
us?"

02:37:11.260 --> 02:37:16.062
MARISHA: Echolocation. I tell the bats, don't
worry about it. Go home.

02:37:16.062 --> 02:37:18.281
ASHLEY: Nothing to see here.

02:37:18.281 --> 02:37:19.542
ORION: Forget about it.

02:37:19.542 --> 02:37:20.787
LAURA: Forget about it.

02:37:20.787 --> 02:37:23.459
MARISHA: We're running an errand for K'Varn. Don't
worry about it.

02:37:23.459 --> 02:37:25.000
MATT: Go make a persuasion check.

02:37:25.000 --> 02:37:27.079
SAM: Persuade those bats.

02:37:27.079 --> 02:37:29.444
LAURA: Inspiration, Inspiration!

02:37:29.444 --> 02:37:31.811
SAM: I'm not with her. I don't even know this is
going on.

02:37:31.811 --> 02:37:36.005
MATT: It doesn't matter what you roll, you can't
persuade bats. They're bats.

02:37:36.005 --> 02:37:37.268
MARISHA: Oh, but I had a good roll.

02:37:37.268 --> 02:37:38.911
MATT: I know, but you can't persuade bats.

02:37:38.911 --> 02:37:39.951
MARISHA: But I had a good roll.

02:37:39.951 --> 02:37:40.855
MATT: But you can't persuade bats.

02:37:40.855 --> 02:37:41.640
ORION: I thought you said roll.

02:37:41.640 --> 02:37:42.949
MATT: I was just fucking with her.

02:37:42.949 --> 02:37:43.979
ORION: Oh.

02:37:43.979 --> 02:37:49.461
MARISHA: I cast Speak with Animals. That's what I
cast. It was a spell.

02:37:49.461 --> 02:37:51.647
MATT: Oh! I did not hear that. I thought you were
just trying to do that.

02:37:51.647 --> 02:37:54.145
(laughter)

02:37:54.145 --> 02:37:56.567
MARISHA: No, I said I do this. I cast Speak with
Animals.

02:37:56.567 --> 02:38:01.552
MATT: I somehow missed that phrase or that never
came up in the conversation. Anybody else hear

02:38:01.552 --> 02:38:02.749
Speak with Animals as a spell?

02:38:02.749 --> 02:38:03.906
LAURA: I heard her say, "I cast--"

02:38:03.906 --> 02:38:05.246
TALIESIN: I was looking at the page.

02:38:05.246 --> 02:38:06.811
MATT: Okay, I missed that. Okay, so.

02:38:06.811 --> 02:38:08.353
ORION: I think you said, "I cast Talk to Bats."

02:38:08.353 --> 02:38:10.232
MATT: So, what was your persuasion roll, then?

02:38:10.232 --> 02:38:11.447
MARISHA: 18.

02:38:11.447 --> 02:38:16.076
MATT: 18, okay. Okay, now this comes into play.
Good. I somehow missed the spell. This was a

02:38:16.076 --> 02:38:19.002
really funny moment of Keyleth in my head, I was
like, "What is-- Okay."

02:38:19.002 --> 02:38:19.989
LIAM: Go home, bats!

02:38:19.989 --> 02:38:21.170
(laughter)

02:38:21.170 --> 02:38:22.433
LIAM: Go home.

02:38:22.433 --> 02:38:24.433
TRAVIS: We all start going, "Go home, bats."

02:38:24.433 --> 02:38:29.657
MATT: Okay, the cluster of bats, you can see,
there is this odd, green glow around them that is

02:38:29.657 --> 02:38:35.067
slightly reminiscent of the top of the temple.
They seem to shudder in place as you're giving off

02:38:35.067 --> 02:38:43.116
this strange series of squeaks and echo-based
sounds. And they seem briefly rattled. As opposed

02:38:43.116 --> 02:38:47.015
to going away, they just stay in place as you guys
drift further and further away.

02:38:47.015 --> 02:38:48.271
ORION: Hmm, good.

02:38:48.271 --> 02:38:50.116
MATT: You don't know what that means, but--

02:38:50.116 --> 02:38:51.742
SAM: It could be anything.

02:38:51.742 --> 02:38:53.003
TRAVIS: Let's do this.

02:38:53.003 --> 02:38:56.549
MATT: You're not getting chased. Eventually you
guys come down. You're now landing around the

02:38:56.549 --> 02:38:58.225
outskirts of this.

02:38:58.225 --> 02:39:00.328
LIAM: He could be watching us, for all we know.

02:39:00.328 --> 02:39:01.729
ORION: I stay on the carpet.

02:39:01.729 --> 02:39:03.530
MATT: You stay on the carpet, all right. So.

02:39:03.530 --> 02:39:06.002
TRAVIS: Oh, we're so finished.

02:39:06.002 --> 02:39:10.017
MATT: What are you doing? While they were off,
what were you doing, there, Percy?

02:39:10.017 --> 02:39:13.688
TALIESIN: I was examining and I've got four vials
of acid.

02:39:13.688 --> 02:39:14.581
MATT: Okay.

02:39:14.581 --> 02:39:17.920
TALIESIN: I've got the three that we had, and then
I've got the fourth, super-- That's a--

02:39:17.920 --> 02:39:19.009
MARISHA: It's really distracting.

02:39:19.009 --> 02:39:20.217
TALIESIN: That's an omen of things to come.

02:39:20.217 --> 02:39:21.186
MARISHA: I hope so.

02:39:21.186 --> 02:39:22.173
MATT: Who has the mouse, by the way?

02:39:22.173 --> 02:39:23.063
LAURA: I have the mouse.

02:39:23.063 --> 02:39:23.820
MATT: Okay.

02:39:23.820 --> 02:39:31.310
TALIESIN: So, I'm going to start by taking our
normal vials of acid and I'm going to pour very

02:39:31.310 --> 02:39:35.284
gingerly right at the sections I want to crack and
start letting it burn.

02:39:35.284 --> 02:39:38.968
LAURA: While we're standing there, I pull out an
arrow and I'm tying the little

02:39:38.968 --> 02:39:41.679
tiny mouse onto an arrow.

02:39:41.679 --> 02:39:47.082
TRAVIS: And I also pull out my climbing equipment
and my 200 feet of rope out of the

02:39:47.082 --> 02:39:48.423
Bag of Holding.

02:39:48.423 --> 02:39:49.541
MATT: All right.

02:39:49.541 --> 02:39:50.664
TRAVIS: And start putting the climbing gear on.

02:39:50.664 --> 02:39:52.845
MATT: All right. Make a stealth check.

02:39:52.845 --> 02:39:55.839
LAURA: Pass without a Trace.

02:39:55.839 --> 02:39:56.896
TRAVIS: 23.

02:39:56.896 --> 02:40:00.452
MATT: 23. Okay.

02:40:00.452 --> 02:40:03.210
MARISHA: Does he get double Pass without a Trace?

02:40:03.210 --> 02:40:05.710
MATT: You take-- No.

02:40:05.710 --> 02:40:08.723
ORION: Are there any jutting stone things,
anywhere around? It's just flat?

02:40:08.723 --> 02:40:14.012
MATT: No, it's smooth, stone surface surrounding
this glass top. Percy, as you've placed the acid

02:40:14.012 --> 02:40:18.446
around the two sides, you kind of slowly move
around and trickled along where the metal beams

02:40:18.446 --> 02:40:24.005
reach the stone. The acid is having an effect, but
it's a very slow--

02:40:24.005 --> 02:40:28.009
TALIESIN: Okay, I'm going to take the major bottle
of acid, and I'm just going to--

02:40:28.009 --> 02:40:32.979
SAM: Before he does, can I-- I'm going to just see
if there's any magic protecting these-- the metal

02:40:32.979 --> 02:40:34.359
or the joints.

02:40:34.359 --> 02:40:35.734
MATT: Arcana check.

02:40:35.734 --> 02:40:37.765
ORION: I should do it, too.

02:40:37.765 --> 02:40:39.443
SAM: 23.

02:40:39.443 --> 02:40:44.672
MATT: I mean, there is a magical aura to the metal
itself. It does not seem to be protective in

02:40:44.672 --> 02:40:51.831
nature. It is more of a, best you can tell, a
transmutation-based magic. Probably something that

02:40:51.831 --> 02:40:55.302
is directly affiliated with how-- The effect it's
having on the Elder Brain.

02:40:55.302 --> 02:41:00.780
MARISHA: Well, do you want to work on one beam and
I can maybe do a focused soldering on the other?

02:41:00.780 --> 02:41:03.634
LAURA: Can anybody cast Dispel Magic?

02:41:03.634 --> 02:41:04.841
SAM: Yeah, of course.

02:41:04.841 --> 02:41:07.316
SAM: But it doesn't seem like the magic is
protecting the metal.

02:41:07.316 --> 02:41:11.384
TALIESIN: I'm going to just, I'm going to get the
more intense acid. I'm going to just-- I'm just

02:41:11.384 --> 02:41:15.591
going to use the tiniest bit. I want to maintain
as much as I can. I want to start working on it.

02:41:15.591 --> 02:41:19.990
MATT: You use a tiny bit and it does hit the metal
with a (sizzle) and begins to dissolve the metal.

02:41:19.990 --> 02:41:26.149
But the actual metal material also balances the
acid with a little bit. So essentially, you begin

02:41:26.149 --> 02:41:29.478
carving into it, but the little bit you use
doesn't keep burning through it. Burns to a

02:41:29.478 --> 02:41:32.086
certain point, and then just loses its acidity.

02:41:32.086 --> 02:41:37.223
TALIESIN: Okay, I'm going to keep gingerly slicing
it through, until it's just being held. The minute

02:41:37.223 --> 02:41:39.542
it starts to give, I'm going to shift to the next
one.

02:41:39.542 --> 02:41:43.780
MATT: You make your way about halfway through the
vial before that one platform you feel is about

02:41:43.780 --> 02:41:46.567
halfway or more dissolved through.

02:41:46.567 --> 02:41:48.930
TALIESIN: All right, I'm going to take the other
half and I'm going to work on the other--

02:41:48.930 --> 02:41:51.696
MATT: Stealth check.

02:41:51.696 --> 02:41:59.063
SAM: Is there any purchase? Like, can a hand grip
the metal pole?

02:41:59.063 --> 02:42:02.725
MATT: It's built in a way that's almost smooth
entirely of the top. Like, the construction--

02:42:02.725 --> 02:42:03.990
TALIESIN: 29.

02:42:03.990 --> 02:42:11.821
MATT: 29? Okay. So you empty the rest of the
yellow vial on the other side. You can see the

02:42:11.821 --> 02:42:16.456
actual metal-- The area where you dip it, the kind
of yellowish liquid hits this, kind of, smooth

02:42:16.456 --> 02:42:21.817
shiny bronze color and the leftover material is
this, like, thick, horrible dark green color the

02:42:21.817 --> 02:42:28.714
way the two mix and dissolve. You empty the last
of the vial and the other beam gets about halfway

02:42:28.714 --> 02:42:31.876
dissolved through before eventually the last of
it's used up.

02:42:31.876 --> 02:42:37.747
ORION: As I do this, I go to the Bag of Holding,
and I go to the Endless Rope--

02:42:37.747 --> 02:42:39.809
TRAVIS: She has that, actually.

02:42:39.809 --> 02:42:40.864
LAURA: I have that.

02:42:40.864 --> 02:42:42.128
ORION: Oh.

02:42:42.128 --> 02:42:44.866
SAM: You're not with us. You stayed on the
carpet.

02:42:44.866 --> 02:42:45.824
ORION: Yeah, I know.

02:42:45.824 --> 02:42:47.597
LAURA: He's right there, though. Flying next to
us.

02:42:47.597 --> 02:42:53.937
ORION: And, the Endless Rope? As I'm asking for
that, I take out my Immovable Rod and I'm going to

02:42:53.937 --> 02:43:00.767
place it, kind of, in an exit position and
(clicks)! Make it stay right above there.

02:43:00.767 --> 02:43:06.629
MATT: All right. As he releases it, this rod is
now stuck in mid-air, anchored permanently until

02:43:06.629 --> 02:43:08.283
removed by a click in that position.

02:43:08.283 --> 02:43:11.855
ORION: And I start flipping through the rope so it
goes-- The whole time, I'm just doing that so it

02:43:11.855 --> 02:43:13.069
goes all the way down.

02:43:13.069 --> 02:43:14.504
MATT: Okay, make a stealth check.

02:43:14.504 --> 02:43:17.907
TALIESIN: (whispers) Grog, Grog! We're going to
need a lever. We're going to need-- Wrench. Get a

02:43:17.907 --> 02:43:20.542
blade into the metal, into the iron.

02:43:20.542 --> 02:43:21.646
ORION: 25.

02:43:21.646 --> 02:43:23.656
TALIESIN: And wrench. And you're going to get the
second one.

02:43:23.656 --> 02:43:24.735
MARISHA: Okay, okay.

02:43:24.735 --> 02:43:27.106
TALIESIN: But it should give.

02:43:27.106 --> 02:43:33.075
MATT: All right, so. You've dissolved a portion of
the two metal beams on each side. You guys have a

02:43:33.075 --> 02:43:36.872
mouse, kind of tied to an arrow.

02:43:36.872 --> 02:43:38.437
LAURA: He's secure.

02:43:38.437 --> 02:43:41.068
MATT: What's the plan?

02:43:41.068 --> 02:43:43.137
TRAVIS: Okay.

02:43:43.137 --> 02:43:46.972
MARISHA: I'll take one side. And Grog's going to
take the other beam.

02:43:46.972 --> 02:43:48.321
SAM: And do what?

02:43:48.321 --> 02:43:55.004
MARISHA: I'm going to start-- I'm going to take my
staff and I do a concentrated Heat Metal spell,

02:43:55.004 --> 02:44:00.318
and I'm just going to kind of solder right along
the inside where it's already weakened.

02:44:00.318 --> 02:44:04.392
MATT: Okay. You understand the spell Heat Metal is
less of a localized damaging the metal. What it

02:44:04.392 --> 02:44:08.399
does is just causes a metal structure to, in
itself, become hot.

02:44:08.399 --> 02:44:09.442
MARISHA: Right.

02:44:09.442 --> 02:44:12.577
MATT: You would not be able to necessarily damage
the metal with it. What you would do is you'd be

02:44:12.577 --> 02:44:15.573
able to weaken it universally, possibly, with
enough heat.

02:44:15.573 --> 02:44:18.684
It's not like a blowtorch or anything.

02:44:18.684 --> 02:44:23.018
MARISHA: Well then, why don't I'll heat the metal
while Grog is prying it to help?

02:44:23.018 --> 02:44:25.830
LAURA: It could also hurt Grog if he's touching it
if it's that hot.

02:44:25.830 --> 02:44:27.365
TRAVIS: I've got a wooden handle.

02:44:27.365 --> 02:44:28.302
LAURA: Okay.

02:44:28.302 --> 02:44:29.843
MARISHA: He's using like a crowbar. Right?

02:44:29.843 --> 02:44:31.383
TALIESIN: Using an axe, I'd imagine.

02:44:31.383 --> 02:44:32.297
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:44:32.297 --> 02:44:33.589
MARISHA: Well we'll tag team it, then.

02:44:33.589 --> 02:44:35.416
MATT: So you're attempting to pop?

02:44:35.416 --> 02:44:40.239
TALIESIN: Yeah, we're going to stick down, and
just pull.

02:44:40.239 --> 02:44:41.483
SAM: Loud.

02:44:41.483 --> 02:44:45.866
LAURA: What if we just give old mousey here-- Turn
him into a giant again and drop him right on it?

02:44:45.866 --> 02:44:47.216
TRAVIS: It's not weakened enough yet, is it?

02:44:47.216 --> 02:44:49.315
TALIESIN: It's not weakened. We're going to - We
have to crack it.

02:44:49.315 --> 02:44:53.505
MATT: Kima looks there and says, "At a certain
height, I imagine it would work."

02:44:53.505 --> 02:44:57.540
MARISHA: Yeah, but we want to save him. Let's see
if we can do this, first.

02:44:57.540 --> 02:45:02.524
TALIESIN: Well, yeah. Let's-- This is not going to
be loud. Well, it will be loud once it breaks.

02:45:02.524 --> 02:45:05.585
TRAVIS: We get him in place and then try it, and
if it makes a noise, we just drop him?

02:45:05.585 --> 02:45:07.161
LAURA: I've got him notched on the arrow.

02:45:07.161 --> 02:45:10.241
TRAVIS: Shoot him up, and have him come down.

02:45:10.241 --> 02:45:14.076
MARISHA: Well, we can have Tiberius hit him with,
like, a quick damaging spell and make him--

02:45:14.076 --> 02:45:15.759
SAM: We can fly up and just drop him down like a
big, giant bomb.

02:45:15.759 --> 02:45:18.610
TRAVIS: We need him to fall, like King Kong from
the Empire State building.

02:45:18.610 --> 02:45:19.909
SAM: We can take him up up up, and just drop him.

02:45:19.909 --> 02:45:21.677
TALIESIN: Yeah, we do have a flying carpet.

02:45:21.677 --> 02:45:22.863
SAM: How much does he weigh?

02:45:22.863 --> 02:45:27.322
MATT: The Fomorian, you imagine, probably weighs,
oof.

02:45:27.322 --> 02:45:28.915
SAM: A ton?

02:45:28.915 --> 02:45:30.322
MATT: I'd say three to five tons.

02:45:30.322 --> 02:45:32.310
SAM: That'll break it. (laughs).

02:45:32.310 --> 02:45:33.722
MARISHA: Well, why don't we weaken the beams
first?

02:45:33.722 --> 02:45:35.988
MATT: I'd say about three tons.

02:45:35.988 --> 02:45:41.842
TRAVIS: What if we-- If we give ourselves away,
what do we lose? A lot? I don't think it's worth it.

02:45:41.842 --> 02:45:44.930
SAM: Let's drop a-- Let's drop a giant bomb on
him.

02:45:44.930 --> 02:45:46.879
MARISHA: What do you mean?

02:45:46.879 --> 02:45:50.649
TRAVIS: Well, we'll give away-- So if, like, we
try and weaken and the metal makes any noise,

02:45:50.649 --> 02:45:52.857
anything, right? Jig's up.

02:45:52.857 --> 02:45:56.078
MARISHA: Well it's good-- jig's going to be up as
soon as a giant--

02:45:56.078 --> 02:45:59.597
TRAVIS: Yeah, at least it's going through. Like,
we won't have even gotten through--

02:45:59.597 --> 02:46:03.037
MARISHA: But what if it doesn't bust all the way
through until we start popping some of the beams?

02:46:03.037 --> 02:46:05.776
SAM: I don't-- I think dropping three tons on him
is going have much more--

02:46:05.776 --> 02:46:08.323
TRAVIS: And even if it doesn't, it might be better
than trying to crank it.

02:46:08.323 --> 02:46:11.344
MARISHA: It's a three-inch-thick piece of pane and
steel.

02:46:11.344 --> 02:46:13.449
TALIESIN: I'm going to do-- Would I have gotten
enough engineering information about it to

02:46:13.449 --> 02:46:16.497
actually have a good sense on whether or not three
to five tons would actually

02:46:16.497 --> 02:46:17.720
do anything at this point?

02:46:17.720 --> 02:46:18.751
MATT: Investigation check.

02:46:18.751 --> 02:46:22.233
TALIESIN: Another investigation? 15.

02:46:22.233 --> 02:46:28.219
MATT: Looking at the sections of the beams that
you've damaged, the thickness of the plane and the

02:46:28.219 --> 02:46:32.877
metal bars, the part where they attached-- You're
not getting a full view, 'cause you're not

02:46:32.877 --> 02:46:36.160
actually looking in the room yet. Everyone's
avoided looking in the room at this point. But you

02:46:36.160 --> 02:46:41.613
gather, with enough speed and enough weight, this
thing would break and hinge pretty easily.

02:46:41.613 --> 02:46:45.389
TALIESIN: All right, let's go for it. I'm going
to-- I'm just going to show where

02:46:45.389 --> 02:46:46.453
I want him to drop.

02:46:46.453 --> 02:46:48.583
LAURA: Okay, we bring him up.

02:46:48.583 --> 02:46:50.537
TALIESIN: This is the point. Take him all the way
up.

02:46:50.537 --> 02:46:54.598
MARISHA: Should I go ahead and heat the metal,
just in case, for added stuff?

02:46:54.598 --> 02:46:55.804
I mean, that's quiet.

02:46:55.804 --> 02:46:57.753
TRAVIS: Yeah, why not? Wouldn't hurt.

02:46:57.753 --> 02:47:07.567
LIAM: Can I just say, I have no idea what's about
to happen, but it's been a great pleasure to walk

02:47:07.567 --> 02:47:09.445
beside each and every one of you.

02:47:09.445 --> 02:47:11.847
TRAVIS: Are you doing the, "It's been an honor to
serve with you, sir"?

02:47:11.847 --> 02:47:13.379
MARISHA: Why would you say that?

02:47:13.379 --> 02:47:17.786
TALIESIN: Screw you. I want my final words with
you to be indignant and irritated.

02:47:17.786 --> 02:47:20.283
ORION: I agree. I think that's poppycock. We'll be
fine.

02:47:20.283 --> 02:47:22.020
TALIESIN: We'll apologize later.

02:47:22.020 --> 02:47:23.743
SAM: All right, who's flying the mouse up?

02:47:23.743 --> 02:47:27.995
LAURA: Tiberius, me and you?

02:47:27.995 --> 02:47:30.979
ORION: Yes. Come up.

02:47:30.979 --> 02:47:34.073
LAURA: But we're going to drop him as a full
three-ton weight.

02:47:34.073 --> 02:47:36.905
SAM: I'm Polymorphing him. I'll make him drop.

02:47:36.905 --> 02:47:40.266
MARISHA: We weakened only one side, so hopefully
it'll only smash one side.

02:47:40.266 --> 02:47:42.034
TRAVIS: It'll just fall in? It won't go straight
down.

02:47:42.034 --> 02:47:45.507
MARISHA: Maybe we can even try and aim him leaning
towards our side more.

02:47:45.507 --> 02:47:47.351
LAURA: We'll aim him towards the part that will
break.

02:47:47.351 --> 02:47:50.160
ORION: Just shoot him wherever we need him to
drop, and (pfft).

02:47:50.160 --> 02:47:51.983
LIAM: No, we want him to be weight.

02:47:51.983 --> 02:47:56.371
LAURA: And the three tons, so we want him to be a
giant when he falls.

02:47:56.371 --> 02:47:58.303
ORION: Oh, 'cause he's fat?

02:47:58.303 --> 02:47:59.314
LAURA: Exactly.

02:47:59.314 --> 02:48:01.579
TRAVIS: Shall we execute Manhattan Project?

02:48:01.579 --> 02:48:02.531
SAM: Come on, let's do this.

02:48:02.531 --> 02:48:03.515
LAURA: Fly it up.

02:48:03.515 --> 02:48:04.566
LIAM: (high-pitched) It's been an honor.

02:48:04.566 --> 02:48:08.239
SAM: On the carpet. Go. Do.

02:48:08.310 --> 02:48:11.684
We die with honor.

02:48:11.684 --> 02:48:14.330
MATT: So Tiberius on the carpet?

02:48:14.330 --> 02:48:16.946
ASHLEY: I feel like I'm already just going to
start crying.

02:48:16.946 --> 02:48:20.112
ORION: Yes, I'll take the mouse.

02:48:20.188 --> 02:48:23.955
MATT: Tiberius, you take the mouse in your hand.
And for a second, it's adorable until the smell

02:48:23.955 --> 02:48:30.060
hits you. You all sit around the edge, like,
keeping out of view. You can see a little bit of

02:48:30.060 --> 02:48:32.238
faint light coming through the glass.

02:48:32.238 --> 02:48:33.347
ORION: Throw me the mouse.

02:48:33.347 --> 02:48:38.143
MATT: As the general green glow that permeates the
circumstance. Tiberius slowly lifts up--

02:48:38.143 --> 02:48:43.311
MARISHA: I start heating the metal beams,
concentrating from both sides.

02:48:43.311 --> 02:48:56.146
MATT: Okay. As you get overhead, Tiberius, you get
the first look into this room.

02:48:56.170 --> 02:48:59.264
SAM: Cages of bad guys.

02:48:59.341 --> 02:49:00.897
TRAVIS: No, experimentees.

02:49:00.897 --> 02:49:03.351
LIAM: This is the suck.

02:49:03.351 --> 02:49:05.084
TRAVIS: I think I just caked my pants a little
bit.

02:49:05.084 --> 02:49:10.449
SAM: I think Matt had things printed in a 3D
printer for this, so it's pretty, pretty cool.

02:49:10.633 --> 02:49:13.161
ASHLEY: We gotta get the prisoners to try and help
us.

02:49:13.161 --> 02:49:17.912
TALIESIN: They're the things we've been fighting.

02:49:17.912 --> 02:49:20.295
ASHLEY: They're stitch monsters, okay.

02:49:20.295 --> 02:49:21.572
LIAM: Well, they're a question mark.

02:49:21.572 --> 02:49:23.786
LAURA: They might be controlled-by-K'Varn stitch
monsters.

02:49:23.786 --> 02:49:30.057
MATT: As you glance down inside, you see
immediately in the center of the room, the giant

02:49:30.057 --> 02:49:35.691
brass structure coming to a point above the Elder
Brain in the center of the room on the elevated

02:49:35.691 --> 02:49:41.898
platforms. You see there are two caged sections of
the room that contain two, kind of, flesh,

02:49:41.898 --> 02:49:47.580
skinless, altered creatures that have been
subjected to serious tortures by K'Varn. K'Varn

02:49:47.580 --> 02:49:51.850
floats off in the distance by what looks like some
sort of experimentation table containing glass

02:49:51.850 --> 02:49:54.934
vials and strange, metallic structures.

02:49:54.934 --> 02:50:01.074
ORION: DM, which side has the crew worked on
relative to where I am looking at?

02:50:01.074 --> 02:50:03.519
MATT: Right here, but first we are gonna go ahead
and find--

02:50:03.519 --> 02:50:08.477
ORION: Did they damage this side or this side?

02:50:08.477 --> 02:50:11.966
LAURA: (laughs) We are so high up.

02:50:11.966 --> 02:50:17.668
ASHLEY: I don't-- I don't want to. I just don't
want to do it, I am so scared.

02:50:17.668 --> 02:50:19.858
MATT: All right, so everyone.

02:50:19.858 --> 02:50:22.147
ASHLEY: I have already died. I know how it feels.

02:50:22.147 --> 02:50:23.691
TRAVIS: You're good.

02:50:23.691 --> 02:50:24.939
ORION: Use the boots.

02:50:24.939 --> 02:50:26.628
SAM: I won't let you die, Pike.

02:50:26.628 --> 02:50:31.634
ASHLEY: And I won't let you guys die. I am on it,
I am on it.

02:50:31.634 --> 02:50:34.895
LIAM: I am going to try very hard not to die.

02:50:35.127 --> 02:50:37.185
TALIESIN: Die with hilarity or die not at all.

02:50:37.185 --> 02:50:39.139
MATT: We'll say the group is for the most part up
here.

02:50:39.139 --> 02:50:41.171
ORION: Not me, I am chilling.

02:50:41.171 --> 02:50:44.122
MATT: There is a flying bear up here.

02:50:44.122 --> 02:50:47.681
SAM: That's a crazy roof party.

02:50:47.681 --> 02:50:54.202
ORION: So then they've been working on this side,
right?

02:50:54.202 --> 02:50:56.890
MATT: They are working on this side. It would
essentially hinge this way.

02:50:56.890 --> 02:50:58.394
ORION: This way, wonderful.

02:50:58.394 --> 02:51:00.641
SAM: Okay, drop it, drop it like it's hot.

02:51:00.641 --> 02:51:10.520
MATT: As you glide up, Tiberius, far above,
looking down into this.

02:51:10.520 --> 02:51:16.130
TRAVIS: Before it falls, I would like to rage.

02:51:16.130 --> 02:51:20.344
MATT: All right, is there any other preparatory
spells that want to be cast at this moment? You

02:51:20.344 --> 02:51:22.657
wanna give Inspiration to people? Do you wanna
cast any spells?

02:51:22.657 --> 02:51:25.400
LAURA: Can I see him? Can I go ahead and cast
Hunter's Mark on him right now?

02:51:25.400 --> 02:51:27.973
MATT: You are welcome to look over into the glass
if you'd like.

02:51:27.973 --> 02:51:34.953
SAM: I'll cast Inspiration on this gentleman for
his throw.

02:51:34.953 --> 02:51:39.549
MATT: All right, so that's a d10. You can do that up
to four people.

02:51:39.639 --> 02:51:42.981
SAM: Oh. Pike.

02:51:42.981 --> 02:51:45.703
MATT: d10 inspiration die for you.

02:51:45.703 --> 02:51:47.147
TRAVIS: Me? Oh, for Pike.

02:51:47.147 --> 02:51:47.955
SAM: Grog.

02:51:47.955 --> 02:51:48.967
ASHLEY: Wait, d10 for me?

02:51:48.967 --> 02:51:52.327
MATT: Either an attack, a saving throw-- I'd
recommend saving throw.

02:51:52.327 --> 02:51:53.256
SAM: Percy.

02:51:53.256 --> 02:51:54.303
TALIESIN: Yes?

02:51:54.303 --> 02:51:55.602
SAM: You get Inspiration.

02:51:55.602 --> 02:51:56.583
TALIESIN: Thank you!

02:51:56.583 --> 02:51:57.979
MATT: That's an inspiration dice to you and--

02:51:57.979 --> 02:51:59.840
SAM: And Vax.

02:51:59.961 --> 02:52:08.382
MATT: A d10. And Vax, Vax, a d10 inspiration to
you as well. Keep track of those guys. These are

02:52:08.382 --> 02:52:11.752
the only ones you get from the bard this game,
because he used them up front. Buff spells that

02:52:11.752 --> 02:52:13.606
want to be cast at this point in time?

02:52:13.606 --> 02:52:15.139
LIAM: I am clicking my Boots of Haste.

02:52:15.139 --> 02:52:20.106
SAM: (sings) And so I come to you with
Inspiration.

02:52:20.106 --> 02:52:21.717
MATT: Pike, any buff spells you wanna put on?

02:52:21.717 --> 02:52:29.859
ASHLEY: I am gonna cast Death Ward on Grog.

02:52:29.859 --> 02:52:32.502
MATT: Okay, is Grog the only one you want to cast
it on?

02:52:32.502 --> 02:52:33.818
ASHLEY: I can cast it on more?

02:52:33.818 --> 02:52:36.694
MATT: Yeah, it's not concentration. As many
fourth-level spell as you have, you can cast it on

02:52:36.694 --> 02:52:39.133
different people. It lasts for eight hours.

02:52:39.133 --> 02:52:44.709
ASHLEY: So how many people can I cast it on if I
cast it?

02:52:44.709 --> 02:52:47.294
MATT: As many 4th-level spells as you have. It's
one person per cast.

02:52:47.294 --> 02:52:49.805
MARISHA: I am gonna go ahead and cast Stoneskin on
myself.

02:52:49.805 --> 02:52:53.671
TRAVIS: So Death Ward, if you go down to zero, it
will put you at a one, it won't take you under?

02:52:53.671 --> 02:52:55.834
ORION: Right before things happen, I'll cast
Blur.

02:52:55.834 --> 02:52:57.714
MATT: Okay.

02:52:57.714 --> 02:53:00.190
You cast Blur on yourself.

02:53:00.315 --> 02:53:02.440
MARISHA: I cast Stoneskin on myself

02:53:02.440 --> 02:53:03.800
TRAVIS: Does anybody else want Death Ward?

02:53:03.800 --> 02:53:07.284
ASHLEY: I am gonna cast Death Ward on Grog and on
Vax.

02:53:07.284 --> 02:53:08.345
MATT: Vax?

02:53:08.345 --> 02:53:09.621
SAM: Vex or Vax?

02:53:09.621 --> 02:53:10.525
ASHLEY: Vax.

02:53:10.525 --> 02:53:15.271
MATT: Vax, okay, so Death Ward. Mark that Death
Ward on both you guys. Keep that in mind. I am not

02:53:15.271 --> 02:53:19.056
gonna keep track of that for you. It means next
time you go to zero hit points it brings you to

02:53:19.056 --> 02:53:28.010
one, then it's gone. All right, guys. You cast
Blur on yourself, hold out the mouse, aim.

02:53:28.010 --> 02:53:30.357
ORION: I going to aim and--

02:53:30.357 --> 02:53:32.686
LAURA: Un-Polymorph him.

02:53:32.686 --> 02:53:34.134
SAM: When he falls.

02:53:34.134 --> 02:53:39.455
TRAVIS: Right as he lets him go. We need the
mass.

02:53:39.455 --> 02:53:41.279
SAM: (yelps) Un-Polymorph!

02:53:41.279 --> 02:53:45.749
MATT: Okay, as the mouse descends out of the
middle of the air, the Fomorian goes tumbling

02:53:46.049 --> 02:53:49.443
down, angrily cascading towards it.

02:53:49.443 --> 02:53:52.566
SAM: It's a falling giant.

02:53:52.566 --> 02:53:55.216
ASHLEY: Do we have anything that is gonna stop us
from falling towards our death?

02:53:55.216 --> 02:53:56.887
ALL: We're on the side.

02:53:56.887 --> 02:54:06.718
MATT: With a deafening crash sound, the Fomorian
goes slamming into the glass. You hear the

02:54:06.718 --> 02:54:13.044
cracking and crashing sound of the planes as they
shatter. The metal structure-- this horrible

02:54:13.136 --> 02:54:20.579
breaking, bending sound as they bend inward and
slam the inside of the temple. The Fomorian, who's

02:54:20.579 --> 02:54:27.459
streaking down, slams into the ground from that
height, taking--

02:54:27.459 --> 02:54:31.004
SAM: The German judge doesn't like it.

02:54:31.004 --> 02:54:32.981
ASHLEY: 4.2.

02:54:32.981 --> 02:54:41.561
MATT: At that height, he is dead, even at his hit
point level, he is right there on the ground.

02:54:41.561 --> 02:54:45.647
SAM: But because he is enchanted he can still
attack, right?

02:54:45.647 --> 02:54:49.717
LAURA: Well, we splattered a giant, you guys.

02:54:49.717 --> 02:54:52.486
MARISHA: Oh, is he dead?

02:54:52.486 --> 02:54:54.380
TALIESIN: Oh, yeah. He's meat.

02:54:54.380 --> 02:55:01.455
MATT: So as that happens, the entire structure
tilts to the side. Part of it bends and kinda hits

02:55:01.455 --> 02:55:06.231
the side of the temple, and whatever strange green
glow was at the top of the temple dissipates.

02:55:06.231 --> 02:55:07.797
TALIESIN: Yeah!

02:55:07.797 --> 02:55:09.178
MARISHA: Maybe we should just go?

02:55:09.178 --> 02:55:10.370
ORION: I swoop down and pick everybody up.

02:55:10.370 --> 02:55:11.324
LAURA: Pick who up?

02:55:11.324 --> 02:55:12.457
SAM: Not me, you don't pick me up. (laughs)

02:55:12.457 --> 02:55:13.783
MATT: All right. You're way up here right now.

02:55:13.783 --> 02:55:14.857
ORION: I know, I'm going to start to--

02:55:14.857 --> 02:55:17.663
MATT: Start making your way down. All right,
everyone roll initiative, because K'Varn turns

02:55:17.663 --> 02:55:24.765
around immediately, and you hear this very
familiar, deep voice echoing from within the

02:55:24.765 --> 02:55:31.509
chamber: "Naughty, naughty. I left the door open
for you!"

02:55:31.509 --> 02:55:34.001
Everyone roll initiative.

02:55:34.099 --> 02:55:36.508
MARISHA: What'd he say? I left the door open for
you?

02:55:36.508 --> 02:55:38.277
TRAVIS: He wanted us to come in through the
bottom, probably.

02:55:38.277 --> 02:55:40.124
LAURA: But we can hide over the edge so he can't
see us, right?

02:55:40.124 --> 02:55:44.242
TRAVIS: Fuck, balls, tits, ass.

02:55:44.242 --> 02:55:49.465
MATT: All right, so. Go ahead and-- We have 25 to
20, guys?

02:55:49.465 --> 02:55:51.067
TRAVIS: 20.

02:55:51.067 --> 02:55:52.897
MARISHA: Are we leaving?

02:55:52.897 --> 02:55:56.162
MATT: 20 to 15?

02:55:56.162 --> 02:55:57.197
ORION: 19.

02:55:57.197 --> 02:55:58.084
MATT: 19?

02:55:58.084 --> 02:55:59.190
LIAM: 17.

02:55:59.190 --> 02:56:00.505
LAURA: 16.

02:56:00.505 --> 02:56:09.757
MATT: All right. 15 to ten?

02:56:09.757 --> 02:56:11.410
TALIESIN: Ten.

02:56:11.410 --> 02:56:14.125
MATT: Ten to five?

02:56:14.125 --> 02:56:16.455
ASHLEY: Seven. (laughs)

02:56:16.455 --> 02:56:19.334
MARISHA: Nine.

02:56:19.334 --> 02:56:22.438
MATT: What'd you roll?

02:56:22.438 --> 02:56:24.358
TALIESIN: Ten.

02:56:24.358 --> 02:56:27.607
SAM: Two.

02:56:27.607 --> 02:56:29.641
MATT: Pike, what'd you get?

02:56:29.641 --> 02:56:30.703
ASHLEY: Seven.

02:56:30.703 --> 02:56:32.809
MATT: Pike, seven.

02:56:32.809 --> 02:56:34.449
ASHLEY: That's okay.

02:56:34.449 --> 02:56:38.013
MATT: Oh man.

02:56:38.013 --> 02:56:45.245
ASHLEY: Why are you "oh man"-ing? Is that a good
"oh man" or a bad "oh man"?

02:56:45.245 --> 02:56:48.199
TALIESIN: That's a "he attacks first."

02:56:48.199 --> 02:56:51.897
MATT: That was-- No no, that was a "Kima going
last."

02:56:51.897 --> 02:56:55.113
ORION: Everyone use the rope. It's time to leave.

02:56:55.113 --> 02:56:57.029
MATT: All right. Grog, you're up first.

02:56:57.029 --> 02:56:59.296
TRAVIS: Who's behind-- Can I see who's behind me
in initiative?

02:56:59.296 --> 02:57:03.888
MATT: You don't know. It's your turn. Most
everyone's behind you, technically.

02:57:03.888 --> 02:57:11.820
TRAVIS: So, with the climbing harness and the
rope, I speed-rope into the room and take cover

02:57:11.820 --> 02:57:16.314
behind the pool. Can I hide behind the pool on the
opposite side of-- Yeah.

02:57:16.314 --> 02:57:18.057
MATT: So you land there.

02:57:18.057 --> 02:57:20.116
TRAVIS: Opposite of him so I can, like, hide
behind the pool.

02:57:20.116 --> 02:57:22.388
MATT: All right. Kind of swing around, you end up
in that area there.

02:57:22.388 --> 02:57:24.160
TRAVIS: Yeah. Like, even going prone if I have
to.

02:57:24.160 --> 02:57:25.992
MATT: You're-- Ugh, it's hard to hide you.

02:57:25.992 --> 02:57:29.026
LAURA: What about the giant? Can you hide behind
the giant splatter?

02:57:29.026 --> 02:57:32.269
MATT: Yeah, he's already landed. So that's your
movement.

02:57:32.269 --> 02:57:33.506
TRAVIS: Yep.

02:57:33.506 --> 02:57:34.648
MATT: You've landed.

02:57:34.648 --> 02:57:35.614
TRAVIS: That's it.

02:57:35.614 --> 02:57:39.179
MATT: You can see, now, the giant beholder
standing with his metal plates kind of haphazardly

02:57:39.179 --> 02:57:44.361
bolted onto its body and a giant horn curving
upward in front. The eye focuses on you, its pale

02:57:44.361 --> 02:57:50.850
blue color looking at you with a menacing anger.
The strange sense of joy and playfulness. It's

02:57:50.850 --> 02:57:53.487
awful to behold. That's all you're doing your
turn?

02:57:53.487 --> 02:57:56.930
TRAVIS: Yeah, can I bury my face in my arms like
this, on the ground? Like this?

02:57:56.930 --> 02:57:58.103
It's like, face down.

02:57:58.103 --> 02:58:02.092
MATT: Certainly try. Certainly try that. Tiberius.
You are coming down

02:58:02.092 --> 02:58:03.648
as fast as you can on the carpet?

02:58:03.648 --> 02:58:04.513
ORION: Yes.

02:58:04.513 --> 02:58:06.704
MATT: You get about halfway to the top of the
temple with your turn.

02:58:06.704 --> 02:58:07.702
ORION: Yes.

02:58:07.702 --> 02:58:09.485
MATT: Vax.

02:58:09.485 --> 02:58:11.981
ORION: Wait, that's all I can do?

02:58:11.981 --> 02:58:17.483
MATT: Yeah. That's using your whole round to just
fly down with the carpet.

02:58:17.483 --> 02:58:23.101
LIAM: All right, I'm going to-- I'm hasted, I'm
going to throw three daggers

02:58:23.101 --> 02:58:25.017
down at him from here.

02:58:25.017 --> 02:58:27.489
MATT: Okay. At this distance, you are at
disadvantage on the attacks,

02:58:27.489 --> 02:58:28.896
'cause it's too far away.

02:58:28.896 --> 02:58:29.644
LIAM: Okay.

02:58:29.644 --> 02:58:31.036
MATT: So go ahead and--

02:58:31.036 --> 02:58:36.853
LIAM: Okay, so for each attack, too. So where's
my-- Okay, that misses-- Well, five. That's a 16?

02:58:36.853 --> 02:58:38.211
MATT: 16 misses.

02:58:38.211 --> 02:58:41.756
LIAM: 21.

02:58:41.756 --> 02:58:43.314
MATT: 21 hits.

02:58:43.314 --> 02:58:46.385
LIAM: Okay. And the last one, I'm just going to
roll it now, is a 17.

02:58:46.385 --> 02:58:47.723
MATT: 17 misses.

02:58:47.723 --> 02:58:50.402
LIAM: Okay. So the-- I'm hitting him with poison
dagger.

02:58:50.402 --> 02:58:57.653
MATT: All right. You do attack before he does this turn.
Does that do something with an Assassin?

02:58:57.653 --> 02:59:02.037
LIAM: Yeah, advantage, well, advantage on attack
rolls on enemies who haven't taken a turn yet. Any

02:59:02.037 --> 02:59:05.886
hit on-- is a crit. Any hit on a surprise is a crit.

02:59:05.886 --> 02:59:08.089
MATT: Right, yeah, it's not a surprise. You kind
of blew the surprise with the giant Fomorian

02:59:08.196 --> 02:59:11.414
crashing through the top. So you have one dagger
that hit?

02:59:11.414 --> 02:59:22.295
LIAM: Yep, a poison dagger, which gets three-- is
nine, plus poison with a DC of 15?

02:59:22.295 --> 02:59:27.586
MATT: Okay. All right. He is currently poisoned.

02:59:27.586 --> 02:59:34.613
LIAM: Yes, he takes eight plus ten points of
poison damage. On top of the dagger damage.

02:59:34.613 --> 02:59:37.520
TRAVIS: I love how nobody's saying shit, 'cause
we're all terrified.

02:59:37.520 --> 02:59:39.924
MATT: All right, that ends your turn?

02:59:39.924 --> 02:59:41.455
LIAM: Every roll counts. Yes?

02:59:41.455 --> 02:59:43.607
MATT: All right. That brings us to Vex.

02:59:43.607 --> 02:59:45.637
LAURA: Hunter's Mark.

02:59:45.637 --> 02:59:48.781
MATT: All right, Hunter's Mark is on K'Varn.

02:59:48.781 --> 02:59:55.996
LAURA: Okay, good. So, his eye would cancel out my
Hail of Thorns attack?

02:59:55.996 --> 03:00:00.884
Is that considered, like, one--

03:00:00.884 --> 03:00:02.998
TRAVIS: He's looking at me, he's looking at me.

03:00:02.998 --> 03:00:08.997
LAURA: Okay. Oh, that's true. Okay, then I'm going
to cast Hail of Thorns on him.

03:00:08.997 --> 03:00:13.015
MATT: Okay, so you pull your arrow, your hands
shaking slightly as you see this creature now

03:00:13.015 --> 03:00:18.486
focusing its attention on Grog below. You pull out
the arrow, you focus your magical energy. The

03:00:18.486 --> 03:00:22.783
shaft of the arrow, you know, juts out all these
different thorns and you release it below. Go

03:00:22.783 --> 03:00:24.249
ahead and roll your attack.

03:00:24.249 --> 03:00:28.074
LAURA: Oh. Okay, that's 29.

03:00:28.074 --> 03:00:29.598
MATT: 29 hits.

03:00:29.598 --> 03:00:31.748
LAURA: Okay.

03:00:31.748 --> 03:00:33.241
MATT: Are you doing a secondary attack?

03:00:33.241 --> 03:00:34.177
LAURA: Yes, I am.

03:00:34.177 --> 03:00:36.278
MATT: Go ahead and roll your secondary attack now,
just to get it out of the way.

03:00:36.278 --> 03:00:40.174
LAURA: Okay. The secondary attack I wanted to
shoot through my Bloodseeking Bow, though.

03:00:40.272 --> 03:00:41.628
MATT: All right.

03:00:41.628 --> 03:00:48.504
LAURA: That's probably not going to hit. That's a
13.

03:00:48.504 --> 03:00:51.307
ASHLEY: Can I give a plus ten? War God's
Blessing?

03:00:51.402 --> 03:00:52.904
MATT: You can.

03:00:52.904 --> 03:00:54.317
LAURA: 23.

03:00:54.317 --> 03:00:58.064
MATT: 23 hits. So as you release the first arrow,
you fire the second one. You pull back and the

03:00:58.064 --> 03:01:01.334
shaking in the hand is too intense, and as you're
about to release it, Pike reaches up and touches

03:01:01.334 --> 03:01:05.095
your shoulder with her hand and you can feel the
surge of Sarenrae guide your arrow. Your hand

03:01:05.095 --> 03:01:10.119
straightens and your arrow strikes true to K'Varn.
Go ahead and roll damage for both.

03:01:10.119 --> 03:01:19.864
LAURA: Okay, so I'm casting-- it's a 3rd-level
spell on Hail of Thorns. Ah! Where's my d10s?

03:01:19.864 --> 03:01:23.419
Okay, I'm so nervous. I don't-- I can't find
anything.

03:01:23.419 --> 03:01:24.606
LIAM: There's a d10.

03:01:24.606 --> 03:01:35.681
LAURA: Okay. There's a d10, there's a d10. Okay,
so ten on that, plus Hunter's Mark. Six, so 16.

03:01:35.681 --> 03:01:37.346
MATT: All righty.

03:01:37.346 --> 03:01:45.588
LAURA: That's the first attack. And the second
one-- 14.

03:01:45.588 --> 03:01:47.027
LIAM: It's so quiet in here.

03:01:47.027 --> 03:01:51.443
LAURA: Oh, I know. 14. Oh wait, I get plus two on
that other attack, whatever it was, it was--

03:01:51.443 --> 03:01:54.470
MATT: The damage, right. 18. Okay. Yeah, your
bracers give you plus two

03:01:54.470 --> 03:01:56.334
to all those damage rolls.

03:01:56.334 --> 03:02:04.932
LAURA: 16 plus Hunter's Mark. I'm sorry, my brain.
Huh?

03:02:04.932 --> 03:02:07.435
ASHLEY: You were 16? 19.

03:02:07.435 --> 03:02:08.798
LAURA: Yeah. 19.

03:02:08.798 --> 03:02:09.722
MATT: 19?

03:02:09.722 --> 03:02:12.210
LAURA: And then the Bloodseeking Bow bleeds him.

03:02:12.210 --> 03:02:14.667
MATT: He is currently bleeding.

03:02:14.667 --> 03:02:16.526
LAURA: For ten damage each round.

03:02:16.526 --> 03:02:18.446
MATT: Gotcha. Keep that in mind.

03:02:18.446 --> 03:02:21.201
TRAVIS: He's hurting.

03:02:21.201 --> 03:02:25.954
SAM: Question, sorry. What happened to the big
mind-control device? Is that disabled?

03:02:25.954 --> 03:02:29.127
MATT: It's currently hanging right now. Seemingly
disabled.

03:02:29.127 --> 03:02:32.370
SAM: So the mind flayers, as far as we know, might
not even be under--

03:02:32.370 --> 03:02:34.434
LAURA: Might not be, right. Potentially.

03:02:34.434 --> 03:02:35.434
SAM: Okay.

03:02:35.434 --> 03:02:37.586
MATT: All right, that ends your turn, Vex.

03:02:37.586 --> 03:02:43.444
LAURA: Oh, and I duck back as much as I can so I'm
out of his sightline. Can I back up on the wall?

03:02:43.444 --> 03:02:46.967
MATT: You step back. It's a five-foot space.
You're having to like, lean, and as you look back,

03:02:46.967 --> 03:02:48.632
like, it's a long slope.

03:02:48.632 --> 03:02:50.065
LAURA: I crouch down.

03:02:50.065 --> 03:02:57.016
MATT: Okay. All right, so, K'Varn starts K'Varn's
turn. K'Varn, now, with like the poison coursing

03:02:57.016 --> 03:03:00.733
through its body, kind of just looks about and
kind of shakes for a second, the eye stalks kind

03:03:00.733 --> 03:03:06.901
of looking in different directions, and just goes,
(laughs) "I want to play." And begins to drift up

03:03:06.901 --> 03:03:08.177
into the air.

03:03:08.177 --> 03:03:10.998
LAURA: Oh, good. He can fly.

03:03:10.998 --> 03:03:18.227
ASHLEY: I didn't know that. That's cool. Maybe we
can get him out?

03:03:18.227 --> 03:03:23.791
MATT: K'Varn moves up. At which point, you guys
who were ducking down off to the side, K'Varn

03:03:23.791 --> 03:03:26.427
comes into sight as he drifts up towards the top.

03:03:26.427 --> 03:03:28.307
TRAVIS: (sings) Shit, shit, shit.

03:03:28.307 --> 03:03:31.176
LAURA: Where's, like the thing that fell? Is it
blocking any sort of--

03:03:31.176 --> 03:03:34.262
MATT: No, it's at this angle right here. It's
basically, kind of,

03:03:34.262 --> 03:03:37.742
following the temple ceiling there.

03:03:37.742 --> 03:03:39.922
SAM: We might have to get Grog out of there
somehow.

03:03:39.922 --> 03:03:43.316
MATT: So, first things first. It's going to fire
its first ray.

03:03:43.316 --> 03:03:46.959
TRAVIS: And it gets three eyes every turn.

03:03:46.959 --> 03:03:49.590
SAM: We need to run.

03:03:49.590 --> 03:03:55.512
MATT: All right, so. One of the eyes whips around.
It aims at-- Let's see. This would be at Percy.

03:03:55.512 --> 03:04:00.502
Percy, go ahead and make a wisdom-- No, this would
be a dexterity saving throw.

03:04:00.502 --> 03:04:03.784
TALIESIN: 24.

03:04:03.784 --> 03:04:07.664
MATT: 24. You manage to just duck out of the way
as this kind of whitish-gray beam of energy goes

03:04:07.664 --> 03:04:18.637
(tsch)! And shoots out from the top of the temple.
A secondary ray-- All right. Secondary ray is

03:04:18.637 --> 03:04:23.882
going to go ahead and fire at-- (sighs) Pike.

03:04:23.882 --> 03:04:26.084
ASHLEY: Me already? I was at seven.

03:04:26.084 --> 03:04:28.581
LAURA: It's aiming at you.

03:04:28.581 --> 03:04:31.061
ASHLEY: You're aiming at-- Sorry, I just got so
scared, I heard my name.

03:04:31.061 --> 03:04:36.042
MATT: Another beam of-- Another beam shoots out.
Go ahead and make a strength saving throw.

03:04:36.042 --> 03:04:39.067
ASHLEY: A strength saving throw.

03:04:39.067 --> 03:04:45.742
Okay. What would that-- What is that? Oh
no, okay, I see. 12?

03:04:45.742 --> 03:04:46.971
MATT: 12.

03:04:46.971 --> 03:04:49.044
SAM: You have Inspiration. Should you need it.

03:04:49.044 --> 03:04:50.290
ASHLEY: Oh. Okay.

03:04:50.290 --> 03:04:52.178
MATT: Yeah, you can add your Inspiration dice to a
saving throw if you'd like.

03:04:52.178 --> 03:04:53.274
ASHLEY: You can?

03:04:53.274 --> 03:04:54.583
MATT: Up to you.

03:04:54.583 --> 03:04:57.052
ASHLEY: Yeah, I'll do it.

03:04:57.052 --> 03:05:00.111
MATT: All right, so it's a 12, plus a d10. Go
ahead and roll a d10.

03:05:00.111 --> 03:05:01.946
ASHLEY: A d10. That's a ten?

03:05:01.986 --> 03:05:04.181
LAURA: That's a d10.

03:05:04.181 --> 03:05:05.479
ASHLEY: Two.

03:05:05.479 --> 03:05:06.770
MATT: A 14.

03:05:06.770 --> 03:05:08.103
ASHLEY: That's a 14?

03:05:08.103 --> 03:05:13.828
MATT: So, as you bring your shield up to defend,
this strange kind of grayish-green ray slams into

03:05:13.828 --> 03:05:17.885
you and you feel weightless for a moment, as, all
of a sudden, you're lifted off your feet and

03:05:17.885 --> 03:05:27.578
carried down into the chamber, floating,
restrained. Unable to move. And you're just kind

03:05:27.578 --> 03:05:30.140
of floating in midair right there, right now.

03:05:30.140 --> 03:05:31.753
ASHLEY: Okay.

03:05:31.753 --> 03:05:36.468
MATT: And then the beam releases you. Go ahead and
make an athletics check.

03:05:36.468 --> 03:05:37.688
MARISHA: Come on, Pike.

03:05:37.688 --> 03:05:39.212
MATT: With disadvantage, 'cause you're in heavy
mail.

03:05:39.212 --> 03:05:48.681
ASHLEY: Okay. (nervous laugh) What was it,
athletics? A five.

03:05:48.681 --> 03:05:50.792
MATT: Acrobatics, technically. Sorry, my fault.

03:05:50.792 --> 03:05:52.471
ASHLEY: Oh, four. (laughs)

03:05:52.471 --> 03:05:54.019
MATT: Four. All right.

03:05:54.019 --> 03:05:55.909
SAM: Thanks for the clarification.

03:05:55.909 --> 03:06:02.384
MATT: All right, you take 23 points of damage as
you plummet, slamming on your back on the ground

03:06:02.384 --> 03:06:04.224
and you're currently prone.

03:06:04.224 --> 03:06:07.599
ASHLEY: Okay. Things are going well.

03:06:07.599 --> 03:06:19.556
MATT: The third ray-- All right. The third ray
streaks up and is going to slam into you, Vax. Go

03:06:19.556 --> 03:06:23.680
ahead and roll a dexterity saving throw.

03:06:23.680 --> 03:06:28.064
LIAM: Okay. 24.

03:06:28.064 --> 03:06:34.822
MATT: 24. You see this deep bluish ray come
shooting up towards you. You pull out of the way

03:06:34.822 --> 03:06:38.985
and it slams into a part of the broken metal
that's left over. As it hits the metal, you see

03:06:38.985 --> 03:06:40.797
the metal turn to stone.

03:06:40.797 --> 03:06:41.621
LIAM: Fuck!

03:06:41.621 --> 03:06:49.210
MATT: You manage to just pull out of the way of
the blast. That's going to end K'Varn's turn. That

03:06:49.210 --> 03:06:51.422
brings us to Clarota.

03:06:51.422 --> 03:06:52.565
LAURA: Come on, Clarota.

03:06:52.565 --> 03:06:54.998
ORION: No, Clarota!

03:06:54.998 --> 03:06:59.588
MATT: Lifts off-- to hover down into the other--
gets to about--

03:06:59.588 --> 03:07:01.985
LIAM: What you've been waiting for, Clarota.

03:07:01.985 --> 03:07:06.432
MATT: We'll say, for the purposes of this, just
for-- 'cause I don't have enough things to put up

03:07:06.432 --> 03:07:11.841
here. We'll say Clarota eventually-- At his turn--
Float from the bottom. We'll say, we'll say nearby

03:07:11.841 --> 03:07:28.666
over here. The face-- he's going to go into the
Mind Blast. Okay. As Clarota lands next to it,

03:07:28.666 --> 03:07:33.887
grabs the side of its head and attempts to Mind
Blast as a cone in front. K'Varn just turns and

03:07:33.887 --> 03:07:41.888
laughs in Clarota's face. (laughs) "Your kind has
tried so many times." Big old toothy grin pulls

03:07:41.888 --> 03:07:45.766
across the front of the beholder. That ends
Clarota's turn. Percy, you're up.

03:07:45.766 --> 03:07:51.018
TALIESIN: Okay. There's still a-- Two questions.
There's still a stick floating in midair with a

03:07:51.018 --> 03:07:52.497
rope tied to it, correct?

03:07:52.497 --> 03:07:53.525
MATT: Correct.

03:07:53.525 --> 03:08:00.902
TALIESIN: That's fantastic. I have a plan. Also,
I've been curious about Targeting Shot-- If I use

03:08:00.902 --> 03:08:04.291
a Drop Targeting shot, that won't work on him,
will it?

03:08:04.291 --> 03:08:06.963
MATT: Oh, the one that knocks him prone?

03:08:06.963 --> 03:08:11.075
TALIESIN: The one that knocks flying targets down
to the ground and then they fall.

03:08:11.075 --> 03:08:17.389
MATT: The Wing Shot, I would say that would cause
him to plummet a little bit.

03:08:17.389 --> 03:08:22.817
TALIESIN: But it wouldn't do what it says I can do
here, where he's going to hit the ground.

03:08:22.817 --> 03:08:27.787
MATT: Not necessarily. Due to the nature, you
could lower his current position in the room, but

03:08:27.787 --> 03:08:31.510
his floating nature wouldn't allow him to
necessarily take a lot of damage from that.

03:08:31.510 --> 03:08:41.225
TALIESIN: I will hold off on that-- Okay so, I
will, just-- I'm going to do a Targeted head shot.

03:08:41.225 --> 03:08:45.072
I'm going to grab the rope with my bonus action--

03:08:45.072 --> 03:08:46.175
MATT: All right.

03:08:46.175 --> 03:08:48.448
TALIESIN: I'm pulling out--

03:08:48.448 --> 03:08:50.145
ORION: Shoot the damn eye!

03:08:50.145 --> 03:08:53.040
TALIESIN: Oh yes. I'm pulling out the Bad News.

03:08:53.040 --> 03:08:54.367
MATT: Okay.

03:08:54.367 --> 03:08:57.772
TALIESIN: I'm going to take a shot-- Basically
take a Targeted head shot at him.

03:08:57.772 --> 03:08:58.809
MATT: Okay.

03:08:58.809 --> 03:08:59.951
TALIESIN: In the eye.

03:08:59.951 --> 03:09:01.858
MATT: Okay.

03:09:01.858 --> 03:09:07.361
TALIESIN: 29. I think that hits.

03:09:07.361 --> 03:09:08.734
MATT: Will hit.

03:09:08.734 --> 03:09:18.159
TALIESIN: All right. So, this does a couple
things. Where's my-- I know.

03:09:18.159 --> 03:09:19.709
Where the hell are my--

03:09:19.709 --> 03:09:22.692
SAM: Guys, come on. This is like, piece of cake,
there's one guy. There's like eight of us.

03:09:22.692 --> 03:09:26.697
MATT: The poison has worn off. K'Varn is still
bleeding, currently.

03:09:26.697 --> 03:09:30.388
So, how many damage for that?

03:09:30.388 --> 03:09:38.366
TALIESIN: It's only ten points of damage, but the
nice thing that that does, which is that, for the

03:09:38.366 --> 03:09:43.375
rest of his turn, up until the end of his turn, he
has disadvantage on all attacks.

03:09:43.375 --> 03:09:49.010
MATT: Since the rays automatically hit, I'll
consider that those who get hit by the rays will

03:09:49.010 --> 03:09:50.768
have advantage on their saving throw.

03:09:50.768 --> 03:09:54.310
TALIESIN: Excellent. I'm then going to take the
rope, holding on, and I'm basically going to do a

03:09:54.310 --> 03:09:57.709
swing so that I'm out of range for any of his
attacks until my next attack.

03:09:57.709 --> 03:09:59.004
MATT: Okay.

03:09:59.004 --> 03:10:02.681
TALIESIN: I'm not swinging down into the temple,
I'm swinging around the outside of it so that it's--

03:10:02.681 --> 03:10:06.314
MATT: The outside over here? Okay. We'll say
you're over there.

03:10:06.314 --> 03:10:07.413
TALIESIN: Yeah.

03:10:07.413 --> 03:10:09.428
MATT: All right, that ends your turn, Percy.
Keyleth, you're up.

03:10:09.428 --> 03:10:18.098
MARISHA: Oh, it's me. This may-- Okay. How big of
a jump is it from me to K'Varn?

03:10:18.098 --> 03:10:25.872
MATT: I'd say, at this distance, it's about a good
50 feet at an angle.

03:10:25.872 --> 03:10:34.140
MARISHA: (laughs) I'm gonna do it. Fuck it.

03:10:34.140 --> 03:10:35.308
MATT: What are you doing?

03:10:35.308 --> 03:10:36.486
TALIESIN: YOLO.

03:10:36.486 --> 03:10:44.080
MARISHA: YOLO! I'm going to run off the carpet and
I'm going to do a swan dive and--

03:10:44.080 --> 03:10:45.707
ORION: She's not on the carpet.

03:10:45.707 --> 03:10:47.640
MATT: You're not on the carpet with Tiberius,
you're on the edge of the platform.

03:10:47.640 --> 03:10:48.702
Tiberius is up here.

03:10:48.702 --> 03:10:50.344
MARISHA: I'm on the edge of the platform--

03:10:50.344 --> 03:10:51.084
MATT: There you go.

03:10:51.084 --> 03:10:55.263
MARISHA: Running, and I'm going to swan dive, and
as I swan dive--

03:10:55.263 --> 03:10:56.786
MATT: Athletics check, first.

03:10:56.786 --> 03:10:58.177
MARISHA: Okay.

03:10:58.177 --> 03:11:01.897
SAM: Yeah, don't fall.

03:11:01.897 --> 03:11:04.889
MARISHA: 15.

03:11:04.889 --> 03:11:08.033
MATT: Okay, all right. So you leap off and swan
dive--

03:11:08.033 --> 03:11:17.793
MARISHA: And as I get closer, mid-swan dive, I'm
gonna turn into my earth elemental, and grab him,

03:11:17.793 --> 03:11:20.563
and take him down with me.

03:11:20.563 --> 03:11:25.621
MATT: All right, go ahead and make a grapple
check. Roll athletics again, with the earth

03:11:25.621 --> 03:11:27.289
elemental's strength.

03:11:27.289 --> 03:11:28.686
TRAVIS: Form tackle this bitch.

03:11:28.686 --> 03:11:29.738
MARISHA: With the earth elemental's strength?

03:11:29.738 --> 03:11:30.668
MATT: Yes.

03:11:30.668 --> 03:11:34.502
MARISHA: Oh, I don't have this book, it's in the
Monster Manual.

03:11:34.502 --> 03:11:36.402
ORION: I'm going to say it's-- The strength is
50.

03:11:36.402 --> 03:11:37.792
SAM: Yeah, I think that's fair.

03:11:37.792 --> 03:11:39.283
TRAVIS: At least five.

03:11:39.283 --> 03:11:41.040
MARISHA: We didn't print this out yet.

03:11:41.040 --> 03:11:45.887
MATT: All right. That would be a strength of 20.
So it's a plus five to the roll for the athletics

03:11:45.887 --> 03:11:48.162
check. What is that?

03:11:48.162 --> 03:11:50.052
MARISHA: I rolled a 19.

03:11:50.052 --> 03:12:03.081
MATT: Okay. All right, so. You grapple onto
K'Varn, holding onto his form. K'Varn is dragged,

03:12:03.081 --> 03:12:10.793
not entirely to the ground, but is reduced to
about that height.

03:12:10.793 --> 03:12:15.654
MARISHA: And right before I swan dive, I go-- I
yelled-- Or, before I transformed, I yell to the

03:12:15.654 --> 03:12:18.722
party, go! Get away!

03:12:18.722 --> 03:12:21.354
LAURA: Oh, Keyleth. We're not leaving.

03:12:21.354 --> 03:12:24.011
MARISHA: Let me be heroic!

03:12:24.011 --> 03:12:31.667
MATT: So you drag K'Varn, now down to just about
like a ten-foot height. And is currently grappled

03:12:31.667 --> 03:12:34.266
on as K'Varn is like (grunts).

03:12:34.266 --> 03:12:38.777
MARISHA: I've got-- Holding onto his eye stalks
and I'm riding him.

03:12:38.777 --> 03:12:41.191
SAM: Okay, let's leave Keyleth here and just go.

03:12:41.191 --> 03:12:42.618
TRAVIS: Yeah, do you mean, Oklahoma? Time to go?

03:12:42.618 --> 03:12:43.533
SAM: Yeah, just go.

03:12:43.533 --> 03:12:44.750
TRAVIS: Okay. Safety word.

03:12:44.750 --> 03:12:46.562
MARISHA: I've got him!

03:12:46.562 --> 03:12:49.957
TALIESIN: Everyone scratch Keyleth off their
T-shirt, now.

03:12:49.957 --> 03:12:51.425
(laughter)

03:12:51.425 --> 03:12:54.966
MATT: Pike, it's your turn.

03:12:54.966 --> 03:13:01.486
ASHLEY: Oh, it's me? Okay, I'm going to-- Oh,
she's grappling him?

03:13:01.486 --> 03:13:02.814
SAM: She's grappling.

03:13:02.814 --> 03:13:04.842
MATT: Yeah. You're prone on the ground, so you
might want to get up.

03:13:04.842 --> 03:13:08.219
ASHLEY: Okay, so I'm going to get up, and then, I
think, probably, it's time to do--

03:13:08.219 --> 03:13:15.083
MARISHA: No, you can-- Don't feel like you
shouldn't hit things because of me. I've got 126

03:13:15.083 --> 03:13:17.715
hit points as an earth elemental and they don't
affect my hit points.

03:13:17.715 --> 03:13:18.809
ASHLEY: They don't?

03:13:18.809 --> 03:13:24.640
MARISHA: Once I hit zero, I go back to whatever
hit points I had. I can act like a tank. Which is

03:13:24.640 --> 03:13:25.951
what I'm doing.

03:13:25.951 --> 03:13:32.345
ASHLEY: Shit. Okay, so if I use the Divine--
Sorry, I just have another question about that,

03:13:32.345 --> 03:13:33.957
where I have the percentage?

03:13:33.957 --> 03:13:34.977
MATT: Yeah.

03:13:34.977 --> 03:13:36.716
ASHLEY: Is it only for that turn?

03:13:36.716 --> 03:13:38.693
MATT: You use it once and you can't use it again
for the rest of the day. That's your action.

03:13:38.693 --> 03:13:42.088
ASHLEY: Then, and then, Sarenrae just intervenes
whenever.

03:13:42.088 --> 03:13:46.295
MATT: You ask what kind of intervention you want,
what kind of aid you want and then I decide how

03:13:46.295 --> 03:13:47.971
that functions.

03:13:47.971 --> 03:13:49.623
TALIESIN: It's a little early, maybe.

03:13:49.623 --> 03:13:54.255
ASHLEY: It's a little early. All right, so you
know what? I'm going to do Flame Strike-- Or,

03:13:54.255 --> 03:14:02.191
sorry, I'm so shaky. What's that? Sacred Flame,
Sacred Flame. I'm so sorry. Sacred Flame?

03:14:02.191 --> 03:14:03.573
MATT: All right.

03:14:03.573 --> 03:14:10.359
ASHLEY: And then I'm going to send it on over to
the beholder.

03:14:10.438 --> 03:14:12.379
MATT: Okay, what's Sacred Flame do?

03:14:12.379 --> 03:14:13.800
LAURA: It's a cantrip.

03:14:13.800 --> 03:14:17.826
ASHLEY: Nope, that's not what I was going to do.
Fuck, I'm so sorry you guys. Where's my--

03:14:17.826 --> 03:14:19.150
SAM: You're the worst.

03:14:19.150 --> 03:14:22.022
ASHLEY: I'm sorry, I know I'm the worst. I had
something else-- Flame Strike, Flame Strike.

03:14:22.022 --> 03:14:24.372
That's just-- What I just said.

03:14:24.372 --> 03:14:25.972
MATT: Flame Strike, that's a horse of a different
color.

03:14:25.972 --> 03:14:27.232
ASHLEY: Yes, Flame Strike.

03:14:27.330 --> 03:14:29.989
MATT: All right, so. 5th-level Flame Strike,
coming out.

03:14:29.989 --> 03:14:31.781
ASHLEY: Yes. I'm so stressed.

03:14:31.781 --> 03:14:34.595
MATT: A ten-foot radius and a 40-foot high
platform. Where are you creating it?

03:14:34.595 --> 03:14:40.804
ASHLEY: Just right by the beholder. Just right,
right-- Yeah.

03:14:40.880 --> 03:14:42.704
LAURA: Away from Clarota.

03:14:42.704 --> 03:14:44.143
ASHLEY: Clarota's there. God damn it.

03:14:44.143 --> 03:14:46.363
TRAVIS: Fuck Clarota. Smoke that dude.

03:14:46.363 --> 03:14:48.694
LAURA: Maybe up against the wall or something?

03:14:48.694 --> 03:14:51.436
ASHLEY: Nah, I'm going to-- Can I change it? I'm
so sorry. Can I do--

03:14:51.436 --> 03:14:52.896
TRAVIS: Fuck Clarota.

03:14:52.896 --> 03:14:55.781
ASHLEY: Fuck Clarota? No, we can't!

03:14:55.781 --> 03:14:57.073
MATT: What are you doing? Pike, what are you
doing?

03:14:57.073 --> 03:14:57.888
ASHLEY: Guiding Bolt.

03:14:57.888 --> 03:14:58.967
MATT: Guiding Bolt?

03:14:58.967 --> 03:15:00.713
ASHLEY: Sorry guys, sorry guys. (sighs)

03:15:00.713 --> 03:15:02.367
MATT: All right.

03:15:02.367 --> 03:15:03.994
TALIESIN: It's tense. It's cool.

03:15:03.994 --> 03:15:07.016
MATT: Guiding Bolt? Level one Guiding Bolt. All
right, make a ranged spell attack against K'Varn.

03:15:07.016 --> 03:15:09.650
ASHLEY: Okay.

03:15:09.650 --> 03:15:14.806
MATT: It is at a disadvantage because K'Varn is
currently grappled.

03:15:14.806 --> 03:15:19.814
ASHLEY: Okay. So it's a 15.

03:15:19.814 --> 03:15:21.142
MATT: You rolled twice?

03:15:21.142 --> 03:15:22.552
ASHLEY: Oh, I roll twice.

03:15:22.552 --> 03:15:23.783
MATT: Take the lower one.

03:15:23.783 --> 03:15:24.904
ASHLEY: 15.

03:15:24.904 --> 03:15:26.412
MATT: It's a 15, still? Total of 15?

03:15:26.412 --> 03:15:27.858
LAURA: Second one was a 20.

03:15:27.858 --> 03:15:29.144
LIAM: 20 and a 15.

03:15:29.144 --> 03:15:33.439
MATT: So you rolled a 15, and what's your spell
attack? Your spell page?

03:15:33.439 --> 03:15:35.024
ASHLEY: Oh, it's eight.

03:15:35.024 --> 03:15:39.743
MATT: That does hit. All right, so on a hit the
target takes 4d6 radiant damage and the next

03:15:39.743 --> 03:15:47.366
attack roll made against it has advantage, so go
ahead and roll 4d6.

03:15:47.366 --> 03:15:56.985
ASHLEY: 16.

03:15:57.080 --> 03:16:08.960
MATT: 16 damage. All right. So the next attack on
him is at advantage. As a reaction, he's going to

03:16:08.960 --> 03:16:12.594
use one of his legendary actions on its turn to--
as it gets hit and dazed-- one of its eyestalks

03:16:12.594 --> 03:16:16.251
bends over again, the same one that hit you last
time is going to attempt hit you again. Go ahead

03:16:16.251 --> 03:16:17.881
and make a strength saving throw again.

03:16:17.881 --> 03:16:30.664
ASHLEY: He hit me again because I took a long
time. But my strength is really low. 14.

03:16:30.664 --> 03:16:34.901
MATT: 14. The ray slams into you again and you
feel yourself lift off your feet as the beam

03:16:34.901 --> 03:16:40.718
throws you across the room, slamming into the bars
on the side. As you hit them, the impact doesn't

03:16:40.718 --> 03:16:44.699
do enough damage, but suddenly these two giant,
fleshy arms reach through the bars and grab you

03:16:44.699 --> 03:16:46.956
and pull you against them. You take--

03:16:46.956 --> 03:16:50.629
SAM: Oh boy. Our healer is about to die.

03:16:50.629 --> 03:16:52.506
MATT: Nine points of crushing damage.

03:16:52.506 --> 03:16:53.325
ASHLEY: Nine?

03:16:53.325 --> 03:16:55.264
MATT: Yes, and you are currently grappled and held
against the bars.

03:16:55.264 --> 03:16:56.122
ASHLEY: Okay.

03:16:56.122 --> 03:17:01.066
MATT: That ends the legendary action. And I think
you've used your movement to get up. That's your

03:17:01.066 --> 03:17:03.405
turn. That gets us to Scanlan.

03:17:03.405 --> 03:17:06.706
SAM: Boy oh boy. You say you can take a hit?

03:17:06.706 --> 03:17:09.294
MARISHA: Go for it! I'm also immune to a lot of
shit.

03:17:09.294 --> 03:17:15.728
SAM: Okay. Chain Lightning scroll. It's the
biggest thing I have.

03:17:15.728 --> 03:17:19.718
TRAVIS: Yeah! Do it! Whatever that is!

03:17:19.718 --> 03:17:25.275
SAM: It's a scroll of Chain Lightning. I can't
cast it at my level so it's gonna be just a 50-50

03:17:25.275 --> 03:17:27.133
shot whether it even works.

03:17:27.133 --> 03:17:29.630
MATT: So, Scanlan, as you hold over the edge, you
look down and you pull out the scroll and begin

03:17:29.630 --> 03:17:34.659
reading it, hopefully the arcane language will
come to you. Bits of it seem familiar. I need you

03:17:34.659 --> 03:17:40.441
to go ahead and roll a d20 and add your ability
modifier, which is five.

03:17:40.441 --> 03:17:45.456
SAM: Ability modifier. Ten plus five.

03:17:45.456 --> 03:18:01.004
MATT: Ten plus five? The difficulty is 15. As you
finish muttering the spell, the actual scroll

03:18:01.004 --> 03:18:06.811
disappears in your hand and bursts into this
strange array of purple color that then coalesces

03:18:06.811 --> 03:18:11.974
and releases with such force that you're nearly
blown off the top of the temple. A bolt of energy

03:18:11.974 --> 03:18:28.229
shoots out, slams into K'Varn-- I'm gonna look up
Chain Lightning here. 10d8 lightning damage.

03:18:28.229 --> 03:18:35.004
K'Varn does make saving throw, so it's half
damage.

03:18:35.086 --> 03:18:38.617
SAM: Seven, eight, nine-- I need one more.

03:18:38.617 --> 03:18:40.360
TALIESIN: Oh, here.

03:18:40.360 --> 03:18:49.576
SAM: Okay (nervous laugh) someone do math. 15, 20,
21, 25, 30, (clears throat), 44.

03:18:49.576 --> 03:18:52.236
MATT: 24?

03:18:52.236 --> 03:18:53.499
SAM AND TRAVIS: 44.

03:18:53.499 --> 03:19:04.611
MATT: 44! Okay, half that is 22 damage to K'Varn.
I will say you choose the targets. Oh, not

03:19:04.611 --> 03:19:06.383
targets. It's as many as three other targets.

03:19:06.383 --> 03:19:07.474
LAURA: Get those monsters!

03:19:07.474 --> 03:19:10.660
MATT: You can choose not to affect your allies on
this.

03:19:10.660 --> 03:19:13.674
MARISHA: I would appreciate that.

03:19:13.674 --> 03:19:18.491
MATT: But you must be within 30 feet of the
target. Which, yeah, both of those would be.

03:19:18.491 --> 03:19:21.976
SAM: I can choose the other, the other guys in the
cage?

03:19:21.976 --> 03:19:22.873
MATT: Yeah, if you want.

03:19:22.873 --> 03:19:24.622
SAM: In the cages? Yeah! Then yeah, yeah, that!

03:19:24.622 --> 03:19:29.457
MATT: All right. Okay, 22 damage to that guy.

03:19:29.457 --> 03:19:32.479
TALIESIN: He gets it halved as well?

03:19:32.479 --> 03:19:39.132
MATT: And 44 to him. He does not make his saving
throw. He's looking pretty rough. All right, this

03:19:39.132 --> 03:19:40.737
brings it-- that the end of your turn?

03:19:40.737 --> 03:19:42.229
SAM: I have a bonus action.

03:19:42.229 --> 03:19:43.054
MATT: And a move.

03:19:43.054 --> 03:19:52.066
SAM: There's nothing-- Oh, and a move. I think
I'll stick, but as a bonus-- shoot, I've used all

03:19:52.066 --> 03:19:57.737
my Inspiration already, right? I can't do cantrips
as a bonus, right?

03:19:57.737 --> 03:20:00.385
MATT: No, unless it says it's a bonus action.

03:20:00.385 --> 03:20:02.312
SAM: Okay. Then never mind.

03:20:02.312 --> 03:20:10.383
MATT: All right. Kima runs around to where you're
on the side. Grabs the rope from you and says, "I

03:20:10.383 --> 03:20:19.637
"need to do what my destiny tells me to." Takes the
rope, and rappels down. Lands there. She is going

03:20:19.637 --> 03:20:26.635
to go ahead and use her action-- If I get into
combat-- She's going to cast Aura of Vitality on

03:20:26.635 --> 03:20:34.904
herself, which allows her as a bonus action to
heal allies within 30 feet of her. And Pike's

03:20:34.904 --> 03:20:40.343
within-- over there. She casts the spell. Grabbing
her holy symbol, this white light consumes her

03:20:40.343 --> 03:20:46.397
body for a second and creates this kind of gentle
30-foot radial area of divine energy. And she

03:20:46.397 --> 03:20:52.244
looks over at you. Go ahead and-- You heal eight
points of damage.

03:20:52.244 --> 03:20:54.794
ASHLEY: All right, all right. Nice, Kima.

03:20:54.794 --> 03:20:56.015
TRAVIS: Me too, right?

03:20:56.015 --> 03:21:00.283
MATT: No, just-- She can choose one person per
turn. All right, that finishes Kima's turn. At the

03:21:00.283 --> 03:21:01.840
top, Grog, you're up.

03:21:01.840 --> 03:21:04.681
SAM: (Grog voice) I would like to run.

03:21:04.681 --> 03:21:07.292
TRAVIS: Is she-- Is Pike still being grappled?

03:21:07.292 --> 03:21:08.884
MATT: Pike is still being grappled, yes.

03:21:08.884 --> 03:21:11.844
ASHLEY: It's okay, just rage. Just rage, it's
fine.

03:21:11.844 --> 03:21:18.809
TRAVIS: I'm already raging. Can I reach him? Is he
high enough for me to reach? Is he out of my

03:21:18.809 --> 03:21:20.839
grasp, or I won't know until I get there?

03:21:20.839 --> 03:21:22.498
MATT: You won't know until you get there. It's
kind of hard to tell.

03:21:22.498 --> 03:21:32.978
TRAVIS: Fuck it. I run over in a Frenzied Rage.
Whites of the eyes only. And try and just swing

03:21:32.978 --> 03:21:34.562
over my head.

03:21:34.562 --> 03:21:38.975
MATT: He's ten feet up. You're 8'7. With a great
axe, you can reach.

03:21:38.975 --> 03:21:48.069
TRAVIS: Thank you! Thank god. 19 plus, Jesus. 27?

03:21:48.069 --> 03:21:49.612
MATT: 27 hits.

03:21:49.612 --> 03:21:54.393
TRAVIS: Should I roll all the attacks, or-- The
attacks right now, and then roll damage

03:21:54.393 --> 03:21:55.983
afterwards?

03:21:55.983 --> 03:21:58.017
MATT: Yeah, roll the attacks now.

03:21:58.017 --> 03:21:59.744
TRAVIS: 22?

03:21:59.744 --> 03:22:00.726
MATT: 22 hits.

03:22:00.726 --> 03:22:02.290
TRAVIS: And 23.

03:22:02.290 --> 03:22:03.635
MATT: Hits.

03:22:03.635 --> 03:22:05.064
TRAVIS: Fuck yeah.

03:22:05.064 --> 03:22:06.954
MATT: To the ground.

03:22:06.954 --> 03:22:15.458
TRAVIS: I know. Yeah, okay. Jesus, what's 14 plus
seven?

03:22:15.458 --> 03:22:17.021
LAURA AND TRAVIS: 21.

03:22:17.021 --> 03:22:18.398
MATT: 21.

03:22:18.398 --> 03:22:30.242
TRAVIS: 29, no, it's-- Yeah, yeah, plus four, 11.
And then 18. So 29 plus-- Oh, sorry, 21 plus 18.

03:22:30.242 --> 03:22:31.835
Somebody keep track of this shit.

03:22:31.835 --> 03:22:34.806
LAURA: 40. No, 39.

03:22:34.806 --> 03:22:42.556
MATT: Each of those attacks is reduced by one
because your axe is currently not magical in the

03:22:42.556 --> 03:22:44.998
front of his anti-magic cone.

03:22:44.998 --> 03:22:48.835
TRAVIS: Right, okay. Two plus--

03:22:48.835 --> 03:22:50.594
MATT: I got those numbers for you.

03:22:50.594 --> 03:22:52.825
TRAVIS: There's one more 'cause it's three strikes
for Frenzied, right?

03:22:52.825 --> 03:22:54.378
MATT: You already-- Those were three strikes.

03:22:54.378 --> 03:22:58.974
TRAVIS: I thought I only did two. Yeah, I only did
two. The third one's not great, so--

03:22:58.974 --> 03:23:03.782
MATT: Oh, it's 20-- Sorry, I heard twenty-- 21,
29, 17, sorry. So that was-- The first attack was 20--

03:23:03.782 --> 03:23:05.564
TRAVIS: 21. The second one was--

03:23:05.564 --> 03:23:08.302
LAURA: 39 was the second one.

03:23:08.302 --> 03:23:09.344
MATT: 39?

03:23:09.344 --> 03:23:10.820
TRAVIS: No, no. It added up to 39.

03:23:10.820 --> 03:23:13.338
LAURA: Oh, the two together added up to 39.

03:23:13.338 --> 03:23:17.257
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'm sorry. And then, six-- 13 is the
last one. 13.

03:23:17.257 --> 03:23:18.844
MATT: 13. Okay, gotcha.

03:23:18.844 --> 03:23:20.762
ASHLEY: Grog smash!

03:23:20.762 --> 03:23:31.203
MATT: Okay, cool. All right. That brings us to the
end of your turn. Tiberius, you just now get,

03:23:31.203 --> 03:23:34.624
using your full turn, you can get to where
everyone else is.

03:23:34.624 --> 03:23:38.495
ORION: Yeah, but I can, like, dash and double my
movement speed as well. Which I should've done

03:23:38.495 --> 03:23:41.790
last turn. 'Cause I don't want to go there.

03:23:41.790 --> 03:23:43.703
MATT: It's not your speed, it's the speed of the
carpet.

03:23:43.703 --> 03:23:50.764
ORION: Oh, shit. Okay, well, can I still dash with
that and double that speed of the carpet?

03:23:50.764 --> 03:23:52.788
MATT: The carpet moves at a consistent speed.

03:23:52.788 --> 03:23:54.365
ORION: Okay, well I don't wanna get anywhere near
that.

03:23:54.365 --> 03:23:55.177
MATT: Okay.

03:23:55.177 --> 03:23:59.060
ORION: I actually want to hover around to the city
side. And I want to look and see what's going on

03:23:59.060 --> 03:24:00.589
with the crowd downstairs.

03:24:00.589 --> 03:24:02.011
MATT: Okay, so you'll be hanging over there?

03:24:02.011 --> 03:24:03.126
ORION: Yes.

03:24:03.126 --> 03:24:06.758
MATT: All right. That brings us to Vax.

03:24:06.758 --> 03:24:08.978
LIAM: Are there ropes still going down?

03:24:08.978 --> 03:24:11.549
MATT: There is one rope, currently, that is
attached to the Immovable Rod, yes.

03:24:11.549 --> 03:24:17.256
LIAM: Okay, I'm going to do something stupid. I'm
going to grab the rope. I'm not going to rappel,

03:24:17.256 --> 03:24:18.958
I'm going to grab about-- How high are we up?

03:24:18.958 --> 03:24:23.785
MATT: You are about 50 feet up right now.

03:24:23.785 --> 03:24:27.334
LIAM: 50 feet, all right. I'm going to use my
bonus action to get down to 25 feet and I'm going

03:24:27.334 --> 03:24:31.935
to jump-- But I'm going to jump out in the hopes
of swinging this way,

03:24:31.935 --> 03:24:35.300
and swinging back towards K'Varn.

03:24:35.300 --> 03:24:37.067
LAURA: (laughs) Pendulum.

03:24:37.067 --> 03:24:41.665
LIAM: That's what I want to-- Pendulum at him,
yeah. I want to jump out and go, woo, woo!

03:24:41.665 --> 03:24:46.484
MATT: Okay, so you grab the rope, leap out in that
direction. Catching yourself at 25 feet. That's

03:24:46.484 --> 03:24:50.636
going to be your movement for this whole thing. So
you reach up, you grab it. Go ahead and make an

03:24:50.636 --> 03:24:52.313
athletics check.

03:24:52.313 --> 03:24:53.946
TRAVIS: Come on, man.

03:24:53.946 --> 03:24:55.137
LIAM: Natural 20!

03:24:55.137 --> 03:24:57.278
(cheering)

03:24:57.278 --> 03:25:04.609
MATT: As you leap off the platform, one of the
ropes in your hand, your fingers clutch the rope,

03:25:04.609 --> 03:25:09.364
and you can feel the pain as the rope-burn burns
through your gloves. But you still hit that point

03:25:09.364 --> 03:25:13.768
in time where you latch on at the perfect moment.
For a second, you look right into the face of

03:25:13.768 --> 03:25:22.079
K'Varn. Swing back, and then come forward again.
Straight towards--

03:25:22.079 --> 03:25:26.817
LIAM: Straight towards him. Three knives, because
I have friends right up against him, this is a

03:25:26.817 --> 03:25:28.126
Sneak Attack.

03:25:28.126 --> 03:25:29.536
LAURA: Nice!

03:25:29.536 --> 03:25:30.706
ASHLEY: Yeah!

03:25:30.706 --> 03:25:32.280
TRAVIS: Drop some pain.

03:25:32.280 --> 03:25:34.129
LIAM: Okay. Okay.

03:25:34.129 --> 03:25:38.188
MATT: Remember, your daggers right now are not
magical. Your daggers are not magical.

03:25:38.188 --> 03:25:39.262
LIAM: Fine, that's fine.

03:25:39.262 --> 03:25:40.437
LAURA: (gasps) They won't pop back in your belt.

03:25:40.437 --> 03:25:49.490
LIAM: It's fine. It's fine. Okay, great.
That's great. That's 17, plus-- That's a 28.

03:25:49.726 --> 03:25:51.199
MATT: That hits.

03:25:51.199 --> 03:25:54.752
LIAM: Let's just go ahead and roll-- That's the
to-hit. So let's just go ahead

03:25:54.752 --> 03:25:56.753
and roll damage now.

03:25:56.753 --> 03:25:57.671
MATT: All right.

03:25:57.671 --> 03:26:05.590
LIAM: So there's no plus-- I forget what's added
for, like, my dexterity and what's the magic-- The

03:26:05.590 --> 03:26:10.759
keen-- Oh, it's two for the keen dagger, so one
plus five is six. Now here comes the Sneak Attack

03:26:10.759 --> 03:26:24.874
damage. Six plus-- There's nine, 12, 13, 18, 22
for the first. Oh, and Natural 20 is a crit.

03:26:24.874 --> 03:26:27.059
MATT: That wasn't your hit, that was your attack.
That was your--

03:26:27.059 --> 03:26:28.129
SAM: That was your stealth.

03:26:28.129 --> 03:26:29.259
LAURA: Yeah that was your stealth.

03:26:29.259 --> 03:26:34.956
LIAM: Sorry, I'm vibrating right now. Okay, so the
second attack is a 19 plus-- 29.

03:26:34.956 --> 03:26:36.007
MATT: All right.

03:26:36.007 --> 03:26:43.693
LIAM: So that is a measly four plus five is nine.
And the last one we use jade, and I shouldn't use

03:26:43.769 --> 03:26:46.182
the jade 'cause that didn't hit, I don't think.
14?

03:26:46.262 --> 03:26:47.878
MATT: 14 does not hit, no.

03:26:47.878 --> 03:26:49.868
LIAM: Okay. All right, I'm sitting on the
beholder.

03:26:49.868 --> 03:26:54.875
MATT: All right. You are, like, now on the rope on
the end of a front swing, holding onto it. As its

03:26:54.875 --> 03:26:59.060
final lair-- Final legendary action this turn, as
you slam into it with the Sneak Attack, your

03:26:59.060 --> 03:27:04.956
dagger pulls out as the rope begins pulling you
backward. One of the rays turns to you. I need you

03:27:04.956 --> 03:27:07.766
to go ahead and-- Let me roll here.

03:27:07.766 --> 03:27:08.707
LIAM: Worth it.

03:27:08.707 --> 03:27:09.836
TRAVIS: Yeah, totally worth it.

03:27:09.836 --> 03:27:11.308
MATT: All right. Go ahead and make a wisdom saving
throw.

03:27:11.308 --> 03:27:12.996
LIAM: Okay.

03:27:12.996 --> 03:27:14.627
SAM: With advantage.

03:27:14.627 --> 03:27:19.470
LIAM: With advantage? 20.

03:27:19.470 --> 03:27:20.613
MATT: Total 20?

03:27:20.613 --> 03:27:21.734
LIAM: Yeah.

03:27:21.734 --> 03:27:27.139
MATT: All right. You-- The kind of pinkish ray
slams into your side and you feel for a second the

03:27:27.139 --> 03:27:32.191
entire room's color shift as if all of your allies
turn red for a second, and anger fills your body,

03:27:32.191 --> 03:27:37.820
and you shrug it off. You feel the color fade as
your backswing pulls you back.

03:27:37.820 --> 03:27:39.749
LIAM: I love you guys too much.

03:27:39.749 --> 03:27:48.276
MATT: Kind of floating right in the middle there.
Put you there for the time being. All right, that

03:27:48.276 --> 03:27:50.709
brings us to Vex.

03:27:50.709 --> 03:27:55.535
LAURA: Right, well, I'm gonna just do the Hail of
Thorns again.

03:27:55.535 --> 03:27:56.980
MATT: All right.

03:27:56.980 --> 03:28:00.505
LAURA: From above. Yes, as the first attack.

03:28:00.505 --> 03:28:06.608
MATT: You have disadvantage on this attack 'cause
you have an earth elemental currently clutching--

03:28:06.608 --> 03:28:13.211
LAURA: Oh, right. It's a 19?

03:28:13.211 --> 03:28:14.926
MATT: 19 just hits.

03:28:14.926 --> 03:28:26.939
LAURA: Yes! Okay. So that's 3d10. Ugh, what? 28.

03:28:26.939 --> 03:28:29.778
LIAM: Those zeroes look so good.

03:28:29.778 --> 03:28:37.498
LAURA: Yeah, they do. 28, plus I get my two from
my bracers, right? So that's 30, plus my Hunter's

03:28:37.498 --> 03:28:39.934
Mark-- 32 for the first hit.

03:28:39.934 --> 03:28:41.174
MATT: All righty, nice.

03:28:41.174 --> 03:28:47.620
LAURA: And the second-- I wanna do it with the
fire string.

03:28:47.620 --> 03:28:48.698
MATT: Okay.

03:28:48.698 --> 03:28:54.541
LAURA: Okay. Oh, disadvantage. That's-- Oh, that
doesn't hit. Damn it.

03:28:54.541 --> 03:28:55.683
MATT: What was that?

03:28:55.683 --> 03:28:56.683
LAURA: It was a 16.

03:28:56.683 --> 03:28:57.740
MATT: That's gonna miss.

03:28:57.740 --> 03:28:59.972
LAURA: Yeah. So the second attack doesn't hit.

03:28:59.972 --> 03:29:03.563
MATT: So as the first arrow slams into it, sprays
off, and manages to pierce the side that doesn't

03:29:03.563 --> 03:29:09.297
impact Clarota or your druid, second arrow
splinters off the inside of the temple room.

03:29:09.297 --> 03:29:10.863
All right?

03:29:10.863 --> 03:29:14.218
LAURA: Okay. I want to kind of duck down. Do I
still get to move Trinket at all?

03:29:14.218 --> 03:29:15.503
MATT: Yeah, if you want.

03:29:15.503 --> 03:29:17.009
LAURA: He's still got Fly on him?

03:29:17.009 --> 03:29:22.399
MATT: Technically, if you're still maintaining
concentration on that. No no, you cast Blur. So

03:29:22.399 --> 03:29:23.964
he's no longer flying.

03:29:23.964 --> 03:29:26.116
LAURA: He's just hanging out next to me on top of
a roof?

03:29:26.116 --> 03:29:27.356
MATT: Yep.

03:29:27.356 --> 03:29:29.966
LAURA: I just pet Trinket and tell him to duck
down. (laughs)

03:29:29.966 --> 03:29:32.076
MATT: Okay. Trinket's already ducking.

03:29:32.076 --> 03:29:33.815
LAURA: Oh, we're both ducking now.

03:29:33.815 --> 03:29:39.488
MATT: All right, that brings us to K'Varn's turn.
K'Varn takes ten damage from the bleed.

03:29:39.488 --> 03:29:41.567
LIAM: (high-pitched) What about the poison?

03:29:41.567 --> 03:29:54.907
MATT: Poison wore off. All right, so. So let me
see, what was-- What effect is giving him

03:29:54.907 --> 03:29:56.883
disadvantage?

03:29:56.883 --> 03:29:58.720
TALIESIN: That was me.

03:29:58.720 --> 03:30:01.446
MATT: Right, from your head shot. Awesome. All
right, so.

03:30:01.446 --> 03:30:05.818
MARISHA: Also, Pike too, right? Didn't she have an
advantage thing?

03:30:05.916 --> 03:30:07.436
LIAM: It was one-time.

03:30:07.436 --> 03:30:08.496
ASHLEY: Yeah.

03:30:08.496 --> 03:30:13.725
MATT: The first thing he's going-- All right, so,
one beam turns around and sprays this pitch-black

03:30:13.725 --> 03:30:22.700
ray that careens across the room. This one is
going to slam into-- Let's see where it goes. All

03:30:22.700 --> 03:30:28.968
right, that's going to hit Percy. It arcs up. I
need you to go ahead and make a---

03:30:28.968 --> 03:30:32.181
TALIESIN: Do I have cover? I thought I had cover,
but okay.

03:30:32.181 --> 03:30:36.535
MATT: Cover, unfortunately, for these doesn't make
a difference. Rays are magical instant. Need you

03:30:36.535 --> 03:30:40.732
to make a dexterity saving throw with advantage.

03:30:40.732 --> 03:30:45.630
TALIESIN: 20, 15.

03:30:45.630 --> 03:30:50.253
MATT: Yeah, you manage to pull out of the way. A
secondary ray that's black as well but seems to be

03:30:50.253 --> 03:30:54.555
just pinned with shadow that is pulled out of the
air around it, actually gives off this strange

03:30:54.555 --> 03:30:59.155
buzzing sound as it (vrrrrr) across the room.
It's going to go for Grog.

03:30:59.155 --> 03:31:01.647
MARISHA: No, Grog!

03:31:01.647 --> 03:31:03.623
MATT: Grog, I need you to go ahead and make a
dexterity saving throw.

03:31:03.623 --> 03:31:04.554
TALIESIN: With advantage.

03:31:04.554 --> 03:31:06.664
MATT: With advantage.

03:31:06.664 --> 03:31:16.465
TRAVIS: What is that plus?

03:31:16.465 --> 03:31:17.943
MATT: Saving throw at the top of your--

03:31:17.943 --> 03:31:20.492
LAURA: Dexterity.

03:31:20.492 --> 03:31:22.638
TRAVIS: 15.

03:31:22.638 --> 03:31:27.732
MATT: 15? You try and move out of the way but the
beam hits you on the side of your torso. You feel

03:31:27.732 --> 03:31:34.064
a familiar sensation, back when that proto-lich
was drawing the life force from you from the

03:31:34.064 --> 03:31:40.862
phylactery that was sewn in your chest. I need
you-- Nope. You take 55 points of damage.

03:31:40.959 --> 03:31:44.920
ASHLEY: What?

03:31:44.920 --> 03:31:48.316
ORION: Are you surprised? I'm not.

03:31:48.316 --> 03:31:49.583
TALIESIN: You're not in the room.

03:31:49.583 --> 03:31:50.836
ORION: I don't care.

03:31:50.836 --> 03:31:52.728
MARISHA: Oh, stop being so pouty, you knew this
was coming.

03:31:52.728 --> 03:31:53.999
ORION: I'm doing it through here.

03:31:53.999 --> 03:32:02.043
MATT: All right. And this time, a pale greenish
ray comes streaking across. This one's going to be

03:32:02.043 --> 03:32:08.698
aimed at Scanlan. Go ahead and make a dexterity
save with advantage.

03:32:08.698 --> 03:32:10.067
LAURA: Tiberius. Can you rally the illithid?

03:32:10.067 --> 03:32:12.083
ORION: What the hell do you think I'm doing?

03:32:12.083 --> 03:32:13.606
LAURA: Stop being a dick.

03:32:13.606 --> 03:32:15.940
ORION: I'm angry at all of you right now.

03:32:15.940 --> 03:32:16.916
SAM: 18.

03:32:16.916 --> 03:32:18.092
MATT: 18.

03:32:18.092 --> 03:32:20.793
SAM: Because she cast enhance dexterity.

03:32:20.793 --> 03:32:26.124
MATT: That's true. Yeah. So you duck out of the
way and the beam just (shhh) past you.

03:32:26.124 --> 03:32:28.065
SAM: Thank you, Keyleth.

03:32:28.065 --> 03:32:32.510
MARISHA: You're-- Yeah, totally. I don't know what
I did, but you're welcome.

03:32:32.510 --> 03:32:35.745
MATT: As it hits part of the stone nearby you,
wherever the beam hits the stone, the stone is

03:32:35.745 --> 03:32:38.751
just no longer there. It's like it just carved
through it.

03:32:38.751 --> 03:32:39.882
MARISHA: What was this one?

03:32:39.882 --> 03:32:43.169
MATT: Very similar to what Queen Ulara did to the
top of the throne room.

03:32:43.169 --> 03:32:48.360
LIAM: Disintegrate. You could've been dead.

03:32:48.360 --> 03:32:55.075
MATT: As movement, K'Varn's going to try and break
your grapple. Go ahead and make another athletics

03:32:55.075 --> 03:32:58.394
check. Keyleth, athletics check.

03:32:58.394 --> 03:32:59.602
MARISHA: Sorry, I was shell-shocked.

03:32:59.602 --> 03:33:02.925
MATT: Roll, plus five. Roll, plus five. d20 plus
five.

03:33:02.925 --> 03:33:04.465
MARISHA: Okay. 15.

03:33:04.465 --> 03:33:10.144
MATT: 15? K'Varn pushes you off, you lose your
grip and fall, onto your feet,

03:33:10.144 --> 03:33:11.494
but onto the ground there.

03:33:11.494 --> 03:33:12.389
MARISHA: Damn it.

03:33:12.389 --> 03:33:14.718
MATT: K'Varn then goes--

03:33:14.718 --> 03:33:18.139
MARISHA: Wait, do I have advantage for that?
Still? Do I still have advantage for that?

03:33:18.139 --> 03:33:20.305
MATT: No, no. That's only for your saving throws.

03:33:20.305 --> 03:33:21.513
MARISHA: Okay.

03:33:21.513 --> 03:33:31.667
MATT: K'Varn is then going to go ahead and glide
back up. No, actually it's going to be like that.

03:33:31.667 --> 03:33:34.976
SAM: Whew! Grog, you okay?

03:33:34.976 --> 03:33:39.217
TRAVIS: Yeah. (scoffs) But a tickle.

03:33:39.217 --> 03:33:45.444
MATT: That is going to end K'Varn's turn.

03:33:45.444 --> 03:33:47.447
TRAVIS: No one told me he had a lightsaber.

03:33:47.447 --> 03:33:54.727
MATT: K'Varn saves against the bleed, is no longer
bleeding, and he just starts laughing. (laughs) As

03:33:54.727 --> 03:34:01.093
you see, like, black energy seeping in around. And
you can see visible wounds that Grog has left are

03:34:01.093 --> 03:34:07.834
slowly stitching. That brings us to Clarota, who
is still kind of hovering in levitation. Clarota

03:34:07.834 --> 03:34:13.652
comes to the ground and lands, looks up, the
tentacles pull back, brings one hand down and the

03:34:13.652 --> 03:34:18.051
arcane sigils you've seen appear on the hands both
light up. And then releases a bolt of lightning

03:34:18.051 --> 03:34:31.661
energy up into the air towards K'Varn. Okay,
K'Varn does make his dexterity saving throw. Takes

03:34:31.661 --> 03:34:39.496
half-damage on that. That is 18 points of
lightning damage. And he's going to move back to

03:34:39.496 --> 03:34:46.318
there. At the end of Clarota's turn, legendary
action. He's going to use the secondary ray. The

03:34:46.318 --> 03:34:58.849
ray is going to be-- All right. Streaming up
towards the top again. Scanlan, I need you to go

03:34:58.849 --> 03:35:01.748
ahead and make a strength saving throw.

03:35:01.748 --> 03:35:03.725
SAM: Strength?

03:35:03.725 --> 03:35:07.343
MATT: Three rays on its turn and then it gets to
make three individual ray attacks on other

03:35:07.343 --> 03:35:08.544
people's turns.

03:35:08.544 --> 03:35:11.918
TALIESIN: It's still, technically speaking though,
we would still have advantage.

03:35:11.918 --> 03:35:14.240
MATT: Advantage, until your next turn.

03:35:14.240 --> 03:35:16.251
SAM: May I use my Cutting Words?

03:35:16.251 --> 03:35:19.011
MATT: Unfortunately, it isn't an attack roll.

03:35:19.011 --> 03:35:21.920
SAM: It's not an attack, okay. Then a strength
saving throw.

03:35:21.920 --> 03:35:23.082
MATT: With advantage.

03:35:23.082 --> 03:35:30.204
SAM: Oh, With advantage. Oh good. Ee. Not good.
Ten.

03:35:30.204 --> 03:35:37.783
MATT: So a familiar beam streaks up, kind of a
deep green color slams into you. And you feel

03:35:37.783 --> 03:35:44.012
yourself chucked off the top, restrained, and then
pulled down with severe force into the center of

03:35:44.012 --> 03:35:44.969
the temple.

03:35:44.969 --> 03:35:47.433
SAM: Oh, into the room? But I don't want to be in
there.

03:35:47.433 --> 03:35:52.348
MATT: And then the beam releases you. You go
slamming into the ground. Go ahead and make an

03:35:52.348 --> 03:35:57.113
acrobatics roll. You have advantage because of
your dexterity.

03:35:57.113 --> 03:36:02.083
SAM: 17, no 19.

03:36:02.083 --> 03:36:05.600
MATT: 19, okay, you manage to reduce the damage
from the fall somewhat.

03:36:05.600 --> 03:36:12.585
You suffer 11 points of damage. Managing to
land harshly on one knee and foot. You feel that's

03:36:12.585 --> 03:36:15.795
going to suck in the morning.

03:36:15.795 --> 03:36:18.201
SAM: No problem. Easy, easy

03:36:18.201 --> 03:36:19.945
MATT: That ends Clarota's turn. Percy, you're up.

03:36:19.945 --> 03:36:28.717
TALIESIN: All right, I'm taking-- I'm taking
another aimed shot at the-- I'm taking another

03:36:28.717 --> 03:36:32.210
head shot. Straight into the face.

03:36:32.210 --> 03:36:34.397
MATT: Okay.

03:36:34.397 --> 03:36:38.833
TALIESIN: Yeah, that's 29 to hit.

03:36:38.833 --> 03:36:40.855
MATT: 29 to hit. Okay.

03:36:40.855 --> 03:36:42.356
MARISHA: Do you crit on 18?

03:36:42.356 --> 03:36:44.155
TALIESIN: I can't remember. Did we--

03:36:44.155 --> 03:36:45.361
MATT: No, you do not.

03:36:45.361 --> 03:36:54.880
TALIESIN: God damn it. No I don't. So that's 15
points of damage. And he has-- he maintains that

03:36:54.880 --> 03:36:57.512
thing where everyone still has saving throws.

03:36:57.512 --> 03:36:58.685
MATT: All right. Good

03:36:58.685 --> 03:37:00.870
TALIESIN: I'm then, I'm actually going to--

03:37:00.870 --> 03:37:04.345
MATT: I should have done this last round by the
way, as a point. I need you to go ahead and make a

03:37:04.345 --> 03:37:09.086
constitution saving throw. You are firing a Bad
News on a small five-foot platform on top of a

03:37:09.086 --> 03:37:13.221
temple. There is kickback on this. I'm just
keeping tabs on this.

03:37:13.221 --> 03:37:15.143
TALIESIN: Okay, so you are going to need a
constitution saving throw.

03:37:15.143 --> 03:37:17.508
MATT: Constitution save to hold your footing
because that is a big, loud,

03:37:17.508 --> 03:37:19.123
powerful kickback blast.

03:37:19.123 --> 03:37:24.014
TALIESIN: Okay. 17.

03:37:24.014 --> 03:37:30.449
MATT: 17. It blows you back, but you manage to keep
your foot from going over the edge. Keep your

03:37:30.530 --> 03:37:37.104
footing at the top. And reload with your second
attack. All right. Percy, you going to stay where

03:37:37.104 --> 03:37:38.413
you are or going to move?

03:37:38.413 --> 03:37:43.019
TALIESIN: I'm going to duck. I'm going to step
back from from the edge, just so that I'm not in

03:37:43.019 --> 03:37:46.283
its eyeline for a little bit. I'm going to catch a
breather.

03:37:46.283 --> 03:37:47.350
MATT: All right.

03:37:47.350 --> 03:37:54.016
MARISHA: Grog, fastball special? Want me to toss
your ass up there? See if you can

03:37:54.095 --> 03:37:55.739
grapple on to him?

03:37:55.739 --> 03:37:58.971
TRAVIS: Yeah, can you throw me at his side away
from his eyeball?

03:37:58.971 --> 03:38:00.084
MARISHA: I can try, yeah.

03:38:00.084 --> 03:38:01.870
TRAVIS: If not, it doesn't matter.

03:38:01.870 --> 03:38:05.795
MARISHA: All right, I'm going to cheerleader-toss
Grog.

03:38:05.795 --> 03:38:08.339
MATT: Okay.

03:38:08.339 --> 03:38:14.007
MARISHA: So I want to take Grog and push him up
to see if he can essentially

03:38:14.102 --> 03:38:16.287
do what I did to K'Varn.

03:38:16.287 --> 03:38:21.882
MATT: Okay, Grog's turn doesn't come for a while,
for the next round of combat. So you would throw

03:38:21.882 --> 03:38:26.647
Grog and then Grog would come back down. Grog is
just now coming off this series of frenzied

03:38:26.647 --> 03:38:28.109
attacks. So you would--

03:38:28.109 --> 03:38:29.259
TALIESIN: So you would hold your turn until Grog's
turn.

03:38:29.259 --> 03:38:32.514
MARISHA: I would have to hold my turn. 'Cause I
can't reach him, right?

03:38:32.514 --> 03:38:35.129
MATT: No, unfortunately it's just out of reach.

03:38:35.129 --> 03:38:38.273
MARISHA: I probably can't jump to reach him
either. I'll hold my turn, then.

03:38:38.273 --> 03:38:39.424
I'll hold my turn.

03:38:39.424 --> 03:38:43.166
MATT: Hold your turn, all right. 'Til Grog's?

03:38:43.166 --> 03:38:44.905
MARISHA: 'Til Grog's

03:38:44.905 --> 03:38:49.557
MATT: All right. Keyleth out of the line. Back to
the top of the next round. Pike, you're up. You're

03:38:49.557 --> 03:38:50.851
currently (grunts).

03:38:50.851 --> 03:38:52.012
ASHLEY: Can I heal if I'm still grappled?

03:38:52.012 --> 03:38:53.566
MATT: You can, yeah, you just can't move.

03:38:53.566 --> 03:38:56.351
LAURA: You can break the grapple though, right?

03:38:56.351 --> 03:38:59.130
MATT: As a movement, you can break the grapple if
you want to.

03:38:59.130 --> 03:39:02.337
ASHLEY: I'm going try to break the grapple first,
'cause then I can--

03:39:02.337 --> 03:39:06.166
MATT: Make an athletics check, with disadvantage
because you're in plate mail.

03:39:06.166 --> 03:39:12.235
ASHLEY: Eight.

03:39:12.235 --> 03:39:19.906
MATT: Holds on to you and you take three points of
crushing damage as the arms are still pulling you

03:39:19.906 --> 03:39:21.933
against the top. It rolled really poorly.

03:39:21.933 --> 03:39:24.480
ASHLEY: Three points? Okay, so--

03:39:24.480 --> 03:39:27.591
MATT: You still have one action and a bonus action
should you choose to use them.

03:39:27.591 --> 03:39:35.112
ASHLEY: Okay, so, I'm going to do a Mass Cure
Word-- Healing Word.

03:39:35.112 --> 03:39:36.157
MATT: All right.

03:39:36.157 --> 03:39:50.046
ASHLEY: So where's my-- and I'll do it at-- Cure
Wounds, I'm sorry. I am so flummoxed at the

03:39:50.123 --> 03:40:06.603
moment. So nervous for all things. Okay. I'll do
it at-- let's see. 13.

03:40:06.603 --> 03:40:08.401
TALIESIN: I've heard worse ideas.

03:40:08.401 --> 03:40:09.646
MATT: 3d8 plus five.

03:40:09.646 --> 03:40:10.689
ASHLEY: 20.

03:40:10.689 --> 03:40:14.122
MATT: 20. 20 hit points to six creatures in a
30-foot radius.

03:40:14.122 --> 03:40:19.169
So you can get Grog, Scanlan, Keyleth.

03:40:19.169 --> 03:40:20.909
TRAVIS: How many hit points?

03:40:20.909 --> 03:40:23.801
ASHLEY: 20. Is that also including myself?

03:40:23.801 --> 03:40:29.726
MATT: Centered on that point, to each target-- I'd
say you can do it on yourself, yeah.

03:40:29.726 --> 03:40:30.976
ASHLEY: All right.

03:40:30.976 --> 03:40:32.724
SAM: Thank you, Pike.

03:40:32.724 --> 03:40:36.063
MATT: So 20 hit points to Grog, to Scanlan, to
Keyleth.

03:40:36.063 --> 03:40:37.538
MARISHA: Is that temporary hit points?

03:40:37.538 --> 03:40:38.796
MATT: No, she heals you.

03:40:38.796 --> 03:40:39.541
MARISHA: Okay.

03:40:39.541 --> 03:40:40.538
MATT: If you're full, you're fine.

03:40:40.538 --> 03:40:41.289
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:40:41.289 --> 03:40:43.761
MATT: All right. I think that's your turn, Pike.

03:40:43.761 --> 03:40:44.992
ASHLEY: All right.

03:40:44.992 --> 03:40:48.438
MATT: Scanlan, you're up. You're currently
face-down on the ground. Or no, sorry, you're on,

03:40:48.438 --> 03:40:52.058
like, your hurt knee. You're not prone, you manage
to catch yourself up.

03:40:52.058 --> 03:40:57.403
SAM: I stand, I look at the creature. No, I don't
look at the creature. (laughs) I just sort of look

03:40:57.403 --> 03:41:04.122
near the creature, and I will punch it in its face
with Bigby's Hand.

03:41:04.122 --> 03:41:09.609
MATT: All righty, let's go ahead and pull this up
real fast. How does the-- What's the effect on

03:41:09.609 --> 03:41:11.310
that one?

03:41:11.310 --> 03:41:18.255
SAM: Hand is an object that has an AC of 20.
Strength of 26. Blah blah blah.

03:41:18.255 --> 03:41:20.745
MATT: This is the Forceful Hand?

03:41:20.745 --> 03:41:22.376
SAM: It's the Clenched Fist.

03:41:22.376 --> 03:41:23.405
MATT: Clenched Fist.

03:41:23.405 --> 03:41:24.819
SAM: It's a melee attack, it's like--

03:41:24.819 --> 03:41:28.050
MATT: All right, so go ahead and make a melee
attack with your game statistics. So go ahead and

03:41:28.050 --> 03:41:30.090
roll d20.

03:41:30.090 --> 03:41:31.460
SAM: d20.

03:41:31.460 --> 03:41:33.530
MATT: Add your strength modifier and your
proficiency modifier.

03:41:33.530 --> 03:41:37.853
SAM: Ten. (laughs)

03:41:37.853 --> 03:41:39.047
MATT: Ten.

03:41:39.047 --> 03:41:40.156
SAM: Right?

03:41:40.156 --> 03:41:40.970
MATT: Total of ten?

03:41:40.970 --> 03:41:41.584
SAM: Yeah.

03:41:41.584 --> 03:41:43.603
MATT: All right.

03:41:43.603 --> 03:41:45.390
SAM: I'm not very strong.

03:41:45.390 --> 03:41:46.993
ASHLEY: Hey, you know, it's chipping away.
Chipping away.

03:41:46.993 --> 03:41:53.324
MATT: A fist swings down. What you notice is the
fist swings, or swings upward, sorry, at K'Varn,

03:41:53.324 --> 03:42:01.238
who's kind of loosely facing your direction. The
fist crosses the front of his cone and dissipates.

03:42:01.238 --> 03:42:02.609
The spell is nullified.

03:42:02.609 --> 03:42:04.618
TRAVIS: His eye cancelled out magic.

03:42:04.618 --> 03:42:06.142
LAURA: You've gotta go from the side.

03:42:06.142 --> 03:42:12.718
SAM: Damn! All right. Are you still hurting, Grog?
As my bonus action, I'm going to give Grog some

03:42:12.718 --> 03:42:14.083
more healing.

03:42:14.083 --> 03:42:15.360
TRAVIS: All right.

03:42:15.360 --> 03:42:27.841
SAM: Yeah. (sings) So I come to you, with Healing
Words. Now you know what to grow. I don't know.

03:42:27.841 --> 03:42:35.886
Healing Words! All right, so that's 1d4 plus five.
It's not very much. Do I roll for that or does he?

03:42:35.886 --> 03:42:37.571
MATT: You roll for it.

03:42:37.571 --> 03:42:38.807
TRAVIS: 1d4 + five.

03:42:38.807 --> 03:42:40.074
SAM: Ugh, six.

03:42:40.074 --> 03:42:43.462
TRAVIS: Eight. I'll take it. That's eight. That's
great. Oh, you rolled for it.

03:42:43.462 --> 03:42:44.801
SAM: I rolled. You get six.

03:42:44.801 --> 03:42:45.885
TRAVIS: I'll take it.

03:42:45.885 --> 03:42:47.140
MATT: All right.

03:42:47.140 --> 03:42:48.285
TRAVIS: Thank you, Scanlan.

03:42:48.285 --> 03:42:49.536
SAM: Sure.

03:42:49.536 --> 03:42:55.281
MATT: Great. That comes to Kima's turn. Kima,
who's now landed and cast that spell on her is

03:42:55.281 --> 03:43:01.985
going to go ahead and use an ability called Sacred
Weapon. She pulls out the hammer and as she brings

03:43:01.985 --> 03:43:06.485
her hand across it, this divine flame begins to
burn around the base of where she's holding it and

03:43:06.485 --> 03:43:08.816
the giant head of the maul.

03:43:08.816 --> 03:43:10.552
LIAM: Badass.

03:43:10.552 --> 03:43:17.549
MATT: She steps forward to there. Actually, going
to move to the side a little bit, there. That's

03:43:17.549 --> 03:43:25.718
going to be her turn. She shouts out, "Someone
bring it down!" Brings to the top of the round.

03:43:25.718 --> 03:43:27.600
Grog and Keyleth.

03:43:27.600 --> 03:43:30.801
MARISHA: Oh, I'm getting a donut. Hang on. Okay.

03:43:30.801 --> 03:43:33.732
TALIESIN AND ORION: Fastball Special.

03:43:33.732 --> 03:43:38.215
MARISHA: Fastball Special. So, "Gymnast, hyup!"

03:43:38.215 --> 03:43:44.400
MATT: All right, athletics check. Actually, no.
This is a strength check. So just roll and add

03:43:44.400 --> 03:43:45.384
five to it.

03:43:45.384 --> 03:43:47.288
MARISHA: Adds strength. Check. 15.

03:43:47.288 --> 03:43:50.995
MATT: 15. 600 pounds--

03:43:50.995 --> 03:43:52.877
MARISHA: But I'm also a giant earth elemental.

03:43:52.877 --> 03:43:54.912
TRAVIS: You're pretty freaking huge.

03:43:54.912 --> 03:43:55.891
MATT: Right.

03:43:55.891 --> 03:43:57.078
MARISHA: Pretty freaking huge.

03:43:57.078 --> 03:43:57.785
MATT: I know.

03:43:57.785 --> 03:43:59.172
TRAVIS: Not that high up.

03:43:59.172 --> 03:44:03.025
MATT: I would say, you go ahead and roll a
strength check as well, as you're also pushing off

03:44:03.025 --> 03:44:04.033
of her.

03:44:04.033 --> 03:44:06.713
TRAVIS: Fuck yes. 22.

03:44:06.713 --> 03:44:12.364
MATT: 22. Between him pushing off the force of
your hands, you manage to move over, leap in the

03:44:12.364 --> 03:44:15.802
air approximately at his height. Before you
plummet, what are you going to do?

03:44:15.802 --> 03:44:18.377
MARISHA: Horn. Horn. Horn!

03:44:18.377 --> 03:44:20.628
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'm going to grab the black horn.

03:44:20.628 --> 03:44:24.304
MATT: All right. You reach out. Go ahead and make
an athletics check.

03:44:24.304 --> 03:44:27.204
TRAVIS: Natural 20.

03:44:27.204 --> 03:44:29.646
(cheering)

03:44:29.646 --> 03:44:37.035
MATT: You grab onto the horn and you're dangling
from it right now. Ugh! You can feel, just to the

03:44:37.035 --> 03:44:41.144
touch of your hand, there's this freezing cold
sensation. As you look up, you can see frost

03:44:41.144 --> 03:44:46.125
beginning to build around the outside of your
fingers. It's immediate frostburn on your fingers,

03:44:46.125 --> 03:44:49.903
but you're holding tight. And you have this giant
eye moving in front of you, rapidly looking

03:44:49.903 --> 03:44:54.630
around angrily. This giant, toothy maw, just behind
you, with a tongue lashing about. And this voice,

03:44:54.733 --> 03:45:00.075
right in your face, going, "Oh, you don't wanna do
that, boy."

03:45:00.075 --> 03:45:03.480
TRAVIS: Well, I have an Intelligence of six. Watch
this.

03:45:03.480 --> 03:45:05.458
MATT: That's your action. What's your bonus
action?

03:45:05.458 --> 03:45:11.231
TRAVIS: Can I grab and kick off and try and rip it
off his head? Or is that all the same thing?

03:45:11.231 --> 03:45:12.897
MATT: You can certainly try.

03:45:12.897 --> 03:45:16.502
TRAVIS: I'll try that. At least trying to kick my
feet into his eye. Maybe it works,

03:45:16.502 --> 03:45:17.729
maybe it doesn't.

03:45:17.729 --> 03:45:18.967
MATT: Strength check.

03:45:18.967 --> 03:45:20.617
LIAM: Natural 20. That's all you gotta do.

03:45:20.617 --> 03:45:22.807
SAM: You have Inspiration.

03:45:22.807 --> 03:45:26.168
TRAVIS: Do I have to do the Inspiration before
I--

03:45:26.168 --> 03:45:27.962
MATT: No, you can do it now, before you know what
the answer would be.

03:45:27.962 --> 03:45:29.547
TRAVIS: And it's ten?

03:45:29.547 --> 03:45:31.836
MATT: Add 1d10 to the roll.

03:45:31.836 --> 03:45:37.656
TRAVIS: It's 16.

03:45:37.656 --> 03:45:44.212
MATT: 16. You grab, you take your feet and you
kick off the front. That thing is wedged in there.

03:45:44.212 --> 03:45:49.058
Your body comes back flat against the Beholder.
You see the eyelid has been closed from the impact

03:45:49.058 --> 03:45:59.891
of your feet, and this horrible snarling sound,
"What are you doing?" So that's your turn. At the

03:45:59.891 --> 03:46:02.238
end of your turn, it's going to go ahead and do
another lair--

03:46:02.238 --> 03:46:04.622
LAURA: You're not in a good spot!

03:46:04.622 --> 03:46:07.341
MATT: Lair action on you. Because you're in its
face, I'm going to say it would give him

03:46:07.341 --> 03:46:11.383
advantage. However, that's negated by him so you
just have a straight roll on this.

03:46:11.383 --> 03:46:13.157
TRAVIS: Okay.

03:46:13.157 --> 03:46:16.053
MATT: I want you to go ahead and make a wisdom
saving throw.

03:46:16.053 --> 03:46:20.222
TRAVIS: All right. Oh shit. 19.

03:46:20.222 --> 03:46:21.811
MATT: 19.

03:46:21.811 --> 03:46:22.832
TRAVIS: Yeah.

03:46:22.832 --> 03:46:31.360
MATT: Damn. For a second, you feel like the force
of K'Varn's mind begins to creep over yours, and

03:46:31.360 --> 03:46:36.310
you feel the urge to suddenly turn to his side.
You shrug it off out of just the general fury and

03:46:36.310 --> 03:46:44.193
anger, realizing that you, wouldn't matter, being
raging, are immune to charm effects. All right,

03:46:44.193 --> 03:46:48.235
that ends your turn. Tiberius? Still over here.

03:46:48.235 --> 03:46:53.438
ORION: As far as, down, as I could have been to
begin with, so even-Steven with those guys.

03:46:53.438 --> 03:46:55.047
MATT: Yeah.

03:46:55.047 --> 03:46:58.233
ORION: What do I see in the town? Do I see a mass
anywhere?

03:46:58.233 --> 03:47:00.414
MATT: Go ahead and make a perception check.

03:47:00.414 --> 03:47:04.460
ORION: Natural 20!

03:47:04.460 --> 03:47:05.831
(cheering)

03:47:05.831 --> 03:47:07.216
TRAVIS: Nice, Tiberius.

03:47:07.216 --> 03:47:11.473
MATT: 20, all right. Looking down, you look about
the city streets and what you can see is

03:47:11.473 --> 03:47:18.057
immediately a swarm of illithids and mind flayers
heading towards the temple.

03:47:18.057 --> 03:47:24.554
ORION: Great, I jump off the carpet. I cast Fly on
myself.

03:47:24.554 --> 03:47:25.546
MATT: All right.

03:47:25.546 --> 03:47:33.381
ORION: I go to where I can just, right, hover-- I
want to hover above them, about 20 feet away. And

03:47:33.381 --> 03:47:42.260
as I come to it, I'm going to flip out the carpet,
get on it, cast Alter Self, turn into Clarota. I'm

03:47:42.260 --> 03:47:44.766
going to keep my original lungs.

03:47:44.766 --> 03:47:46.300
MATT: Okay, hold on. One turn.

03:47:46.300 --> 03:47:50.813
ORION: Yeah. I'm going to-- Yeah, I'll spend
whatever I gotta spend. I'm doing all of it.

03:47:50.813 --> 03:47:55.992
MATT: All right, so, to get to the bottom of the--
You get 20 feet away, you said, which is, you get

03:47:55.992 --> 03:47:59.791
about that far at the end of this turn with the
magic carpet. So you're about there, I'd say, on

03:47:59.791 --> 03:48:05.312
the outside. So you then-- You jump off the
carpet. You turn, you cast Fly on yourself.

03:48:05.312 --> 03:48:08.177
ORION: Can they see me? The crowd that's coming?

03:48:08.177 --> 03:48:12.465
MATT: You don't know that yet. You imagine you're
out in the open, but you don't know if anyone's

03:48:12.465 --> 03:48:13.761
noticed you yet.

03:48:13.761 --> 03:48:15.625
ORION: That's what I-- I'm going to go towards the
crowd. I wanna--

03:48:15.625 --> 03:48:18.983
MATT: Right. But you can only move so fast on the
carpet. You come down to the bottom of--

03:48:18.983 --> 03:48:23.964
ORION: No, I dispelled the carpet so I can do
double my speed so I can get there, and then I

03:48:23.964 --> 03:48:25.976
redo the carpet as I--

03:48:25.976 --> 03:48:29.285
MATT: No, you can't just like grab the carpet and
go down. You have to jump off the carpet, leaving

03:48:29.285 --> 03:48:30.824
the carpet behind.

03:48:30.824 --> 03:48:33.235
ORION: No, I grabbed it. As I'm going with me. I
can't do that?

03:48:33.235 --> 03:48:39.997
MATT: It's a really, really-- It's not like a
boop! It's a six, it's a 15-foot-by-10-foot

03:48:39.997 --> 03:48:41.462
carpet. It's very thick.

03:48:41.462 --> 03:48:43.035
ORION: Well, that's not going to be as cool. Well,
then I'll just stay on the stupid carpet, then.

03:48:43.129 --> 03:48:46.414
MATT: Okay. Just letting you know. You're pretty
much going to have to let the carpet go, or take

03:48:46.478 --> 03:48:51.258
it down slower. So as you coast down, you get to
about this point. You said you cast Fly on

03:48:51.502 --> 03:48:53.401
yourself, or are you just going to go for the
Alter Self?

03:48:53.401 --> 03:48:55.570
ORION: If I'm, like, down at that level then I
don't really have to do that.

03:48:55.570 --> 03:48:56.713
I'll cast Alter Self though.

03:48:56.713 --> 03:48:57.677
MATT: Okay.

03:48:57.677 --> 03:48:58.648
ORION: Turn into Clarota.

03:48:58.648 --> 03:49:03.407
MATT: All right, you're now in the form of a mind
flayer. Covered in rags, with a big old metallic

03:49:03.407 --> 03:49:04.752
head piece.

03:49:04.752 --> 03:49:12.471
ORION: Do I-- actually, sans head piece. Clarota
without the head piece. And what do I see when I

03:49:12.471 --> 03:49:13.743
get down there?

03:49:13.743 --> 03:49:16.917
MATT: As you coast down you can see a group of
what looks like three mind flayers with about

03:49:16.917 --> 03:49:21.948
seven slaves swarming in towards the front of the
temple. They haven't quite noticed you yet.

03:49:21.948 --> 03:49:27.078
ORION: How far away are they?

03:49:27.078 --> 03:49:29.321
MATT: About 30 feet from you.

03:49:29.321 --> 03:49:34.068
ORION: Great. You, over there! Quickly! And I get
their attention.

03:49:34.068 --> 03:49:40.393
MATT: They all stop and look up at you. A look of
confusion, as mind flayers both do not speak

03:49:40.393 --> 03:49:45.883
through language, let alone speak Common out
loud.

03:49:45.883 --> 03:49:51.998
ORION: Look, I took the form of one of your own.
Pretty much to get your attention. We need your

03:49:51.998 --> 03:49:56.957
help. We want to defeat the one who's taken
control over your mind. We are the ones who

03:49:56.957 --> 03:50:02.787
disabled the crystal to begin with. Please come on
this-- With me. We can go much faster.

03:50:02.787 --> 03:50:05.215
Up here, please!

03:50:05.215 --> 03:50:07.666
MATT: You make a persuasion roll.

03:50:07.666 --> 03:50:17.936
ORION: Damn right. Six plus ten. That's 16, plus
nine is-- My persuasion's nine. Plus 16.

03:50:18.018 --> 03:50:19.864
MATT: Wait, what'd you say? 20?

03:50:19.864 --> 03:50:20.794
ORION: Six.

03:50:20.794 --> 03:50:22.336
MATT: Plus ten?

03:50:22.336 --> 03:50:23.658
ORION: Plus nine.

03:50:23.658 --> 03:50:24.942
MATT: Plus nine.

03:50:24.942 --> 03:50:27.070
ORION: That's 25.

03:50:27.070 --> 03:50:29.033
MATT: Okay.

03:50:29.033 --> 03:50:38.174
SAM: You stumped him.

03:50:38.174 --> 03:50:42.013
MATT: There's-- No, there's a really, really,
really fine line here.

03:50:42.013 --> 03:50:43.661
ORION: Oh yes.

03:50:43.661 --> 03:50:46.003
LAURA: They could suck your brain out.

03:50:46.003 --> 03:50:47.882
ORION: Not if they're allies.

03:50:47.882 --> 03:50:49.158
ASHLEY: How many of them are there?

03:50:49.158 --> 03:50:50.375
LIAM AND TALIESIN: Hundreds.

03:50:50.375 --> 03:50:54.617
MATT: Two of them kind of look at each other
confused, and look back. Third one looks up at

03:50:54.617 --> 03:50:58.556
you. And just continues inside the temple.

03:50:58.556 --> 03:51:01.128
ORION: Well, I guess that was something.

03:51:01.128 --> 03:51:04.348
TRAVIS: Yeah, it might've been. You might've
started it.

03:51:04.348 --> 03:51:06.628
MATT: You didn't get Mind Blasted three times.

03:51:06.628 --> 03:51:11.520
ORION: Noticing that, then, I will go to-- I don't
have another movement, right? Or was--

03:51:11.520 --> 03:51:13.074
MATT: No, that's your turn, yo.

03:51:13.074 --> 03:51:14.461
TRAVIS: That's good, though.

03:51:14.461 --> 03:51:15.617
SAM: That was great.

03:51:15.617 --> 03:51:16.714
ORION: That's what I do.

03:51:16.714 --> 03:51:19.566
MATT: All right. Vax, you're up.

03:51:19.566 --> 03:51:26.384
LIAM: All right, I'm going to run-- I'm still
Hasted directly underneath the mind flayer. And

03:51:26.384 --> 03:51:28.543
throw the daggers up.

03:51:28.543 --> 03:51:30.386
MATT: You mean K'Varn?

03:51:30.386 --> 03:51:38.262
LIAM: Yeah. Oh, sorry. Thank you. Yes, and here we
go. Ten. First attack is a 21.

03:51:38.262 --> 03:51:42.029
MATT: All right, with disadvantage on both those
attacks because you currently have Grog dangling

03:51:42.029 --> 03:51:44.137
from the creature.

03:51:44.137 --> 03:51:54.696
LIAM: All right, so, okay. So that one misses.
Second one. That's a 15. Misses, right? And the

03:51:54.696 --> 03:51:57.064
second one, come on, man, is a 20.

03:51:57.064 --> 03:51:58.442
MATT: That does hit.

03:51:58.442 --> 03:52:06.993
LIAM: Okay. That's a dagger into its butt. Three.
And there's no non-magical effect on me at the

03:52:06.993 --> 03:52:10.300
moment, right? 'Cause I'm out of his vision? So
that's a nine?

03:52:10.300 --> 03:52:11.601
MATT: Correct, yep.

03:52:11.601 --> 03:52:12.890
LIAM: Just for damage? Okay.

03:52:12.890 --> 03:52:18.964
MATT: Dagger slams into the bottom. Because you're
out of the eye range, returns to your side. End of

03:52:18.964 --> 03:52:22.932
your turn, it's going to use legendary action.
Final ray.

03:52:22.932 --> 03:52:25.349
LIAM: Come sit on me, dude. Come on down.

03:52:25.349 --> 03:52:34.861
MATT: All right. This stalk now gives off this
weird yellowish-- Like a very faint yellowish

03:52:34.861 --> 03:52:39.827
see-through color, kind of scoops across the
ground, right past you, after you throw the

03:52:39.827 --> 03:52:42.282
dagger. Go ahead and roll a constitution saving
throw.

03:52:42.282 --> 03:52:44.711
LIAM: It's able to-- I just don't know, I'm not
challenging it.

03:52:44.711 --> 03:52:46.462
MATT: It has stalks everywhere.

03:52:46.462 --> 03:52:47.829
LIAM: Even under-- On its tushie?

03:52:47.829 --> 03:52:50.042
MATT: These stalks aim down.

03:52:50.042 --> 03:52:52.291
LIAM: Oh. I was going off that, okay. All right,
so what am I making at the--

03:52:52.291 --> 03:52:53.820
MATT: Constitution saving throw.

03:52:53.820 --> 03:52:55.875
You have advantage, because Percy--

03:52:55.956 --> 03:52:58.482
LIAM: Advantage, 18.

03:52:58.482 --> 03:53:05.596
MATT: 18? All right. You manage to just dodge out
of the way. It crests your arm, and for a second

03:53:05.596 --> 03:53:09.104
you feel the muscles tense up and then you just
shake off the effect.

03:53:09.104 --> 03:53:12.968
All right, that brings us to Vex.

03:53:12.968 --> 03:53:21.371
LAURA: That's me. Okay. I'm going-- Grog is
dangling from him, but I'm still going to try to

03:53:21.371 --> 03:53:27.839
shoot him. I'm going to try to shoot him with the
Ensnare arrow that I have from Percy.

03:53:27.839 --> 03:53:29.311
MATT: Okay.

03:53:29.311 --> 03:53:34.835
LAURA: Try to maybe see if I can tie some of those
stalks down to his head with it. Yeah?

03:53:34.835 --> 03:53:36.238
LIAM: Like a hairnet?

03:53:36.238 --> 03:53:37.463
LAURA: Yeah, like a little hairnet.

03:53:37.463 --> 03:53:39.202
MATT: Make an attack with disadvantage.

03:53:39.202 --> 03:53:48.348
LAURA: The disadvantage was a-- What was that,
20?

03:53:48.348 --> 03:53:51.361
MATT: Total 20? Okay. That hits.

03:53:51.361 --> 03:53:52.396
LAURA: Yes!

03:53:52.396 --> 03:53:53.495
TALIESIN: Science!

03:53:53.495 --> 03:53:55.589
LAURA: Okay, so what do I-- How do I do that? With
the Ensnare arrow?

03:53:55.589 --> 03:53:59.214
MATT: Essentially how it works is it works like a
Tanglefoot bag. It slams into it. You roll damage

03:53:59.214 --> 03:54:05.760
for the arrow, and it bursts over him like a giant
package of globby, thick glue. Just (pfft).

03:54:05.760 --> 03:54:10.167
LAURA: 15, 16, 17. 19.

03:54:10.167 --> 03:54:18.117
MATT: 19 damage. All right. It looks a little
goopy. The purpose of the Tanglefoot bag usually

03:54:18.117 --> 03:54:20.950
is to stick something to something, like a
creature on the ground.

03:54:20.950 --> 03:54:22.091
LAURA: Oh, okay. I didn't know that.

03:54:22.091 --> 03:54:25.974
MATT: So he's got goop on him. Doesn't seem to be
affecting him much. You wanna fire another arrow?

03:54:25.974 --> 03:54:31.241
LAURA: Oh, I thought it was like a sort of
wrap-around-y arrow. It wasn't like a-- I thought

03:54:31.241 --> 03:54:32.277
it was like a--

03:54:32.277 --> 03:54:33.085
MARISHA: Like a bolo?

03:54:33.085 --> 03:54:33.843
LAURA: Yeah.

03:54:33.843 --> 03:54:34.821
TALIESIN: It was a bolo-y thing.

03:54:34.821 --> 03:54:36.102
MATT: Oh, I thought this was the Tanglefoot
arrow.

03:54:36.102 --> 03:54:41.169
TALIESIN: The Tanglefoot was basically like a wire
thing. Yeah, it was a bolo arrow. That's how it--

03:54:41.169 --> 03:54:43.701
That was how I originally pitched it, was a bolo
arrow.

03:54:43.701 --> 03:54:45.411
LAURA: That's what he told me it was a long time
ago.

03:54:45.411 --> 03:54:52.027
MATT: Okay. Then, given that circumstance, the
bolo wraps around him. Bolos--

03:54:52.027 --> 03:54:54.931
LAURA: Hopefully taking some of the stalks,
pinning it to his body?

03:54:54.931 --> 03:54:59.067
MATT: Bolos are used to trap creature's legs when
they're running. Wrap around it.

03:54:59.067 --> 03:55:00.427
They kind of fall over.

03:55:00.427 --> 03:55:01.461
LAURA: Right.

03:55:01.461 --> 03:55:05.767
MATT: It wraps around some of the eyestalks or
parts and doesn't seem to have an additional

03:55:05.767 --> 03:55:10.917
effect than the damage. Unfortunately, it's just--
bolo against beholder it's kind of a square peg in

03:55:10.917 --> 03:55:12.007
a hole.

03:55:12.007 --> 03:55:15.929
LAURA: I know, I was just hoping I could pin a
stalk or two. All right, the second one, with the

03:55:15.929 --> 03:55:18.092
burning bow.

03:55:18.092 --> 03:55:19.329
MATT: All right.

03:55:19.329 --> 03:55:24.611
LAURA: Wasn't that the same thing as the first
one? Oh no.

03:55:24.611 --> 03:55:28.312
LIAM: I didn't see the second one. 17?

03:55:28.312 --> 03:55:43.019
LAURA: 15, 24? Okay, so. Ten, 11, 12. 16 plus ten
for the burning.

03:55:43.019 --> 03:55:44.085
MATT: Okay.

03:55:44.085 --> 03:55:46.811
LAURA: 19.

03:55:46.811 --> 03:55:52.683
MATT: All right, gotcha. Cool. As the arrow
streaks and then slams into his side you see the

03:55:52.683 --> 03:55:56.247
burst of flame begin to burn up its side. And you
can see now, the armored plates on the side of

03:55:56.247 --> 03:56:01.107
K'Varn, some are starting to, like, creak off and
kind of peel off at the side. The damage is

03:56:01.107 --> 03:56:06.627
starting to have a visual impact on K'Varn. You
can see there's bits of beholder blood

03:56:06.627 --> 03:56:09.669
beginning to pour down the side of its
meatball-like torso.

03:56:09.746 --> 03:56:12.547
Is that the end of your turn?

03:56:12.547 --> 03:56:16.004
LAURA: And I duck down again and try to drop out
of his view.

03:56:16.004 --> 03:56:23.954
MATT: That brings it to K'Varn's turn. K'Varn is
going to attempt to shrug you off the horn, Grog.

03:56:23.954 --> 03:56:25.653
MARISHA: Hold on!

03:56:25.653 --> 03:56:28.225
MATT: First it's going to fly up.

03:56:28.225 --> 03:56:30.986
TRAVIS: Oh, great, yeah. That's good.

03:56:30.986 --> 03:56:32.712
MARISHA: It's going to fly up?

03:56:32.712 --> 03:56:34.805
TRAVIS: I had to grab that thing.

03:56:34.805 --> 03:56:39.067
MARISHA: Can I move underneath so I can maybe
catch Grog from where I cheerleader--

03:56:39.067 --> 03:56:40.475
MATT: Unfortunately, right now, no.

03:56:40.475 --> 03:56:42.481
ORION: Why are you cheerleading somebody?

03:56:42.481 --> 03:56:48.552
MARISHA: Prep. Prep for the basket? Because I
imagine it was like a cheerleader.

03:56:48.552 --> 03:56:50.588
MATT: Make an athletics check.

03:56:50.588 --> 03:56:56.522
TRAVIS: 15.

03:56:56.522 --> 03:57:04.702
MATT: 15? K'Varn nudges you. A sheer bit of force.
Your hand lets go and you plummet backward again,

03:57:04.727 --> 03:57:11.448
slamming into the ground. Make an acrobatics check
to try and reduce the damage if you like.

03:57:11.448 --> 03:57:13.663
TRAVIS: 17?

03:57:13.663 --> 03:57:20.313
MATT: All right. You go ahead and slam into the
ground. You manage to reduce the damage somewhat,

03:57:20.313 --> 03:57:25.502
but your back cracks into the part of stone that
raises up over the platform. You, unfortunately,

03:57:25.502 --> 03:57:30.463
you reduce the damage somewhat, but you still end
up taking 14 points of damage from the impact.

03:57:30.463 --> 03:57:31.452
TALIESIN: Okay.

03:57:31.452 --> 03:57:36.085
MATT: And you are prone. That was K'Varn's
movement. Now, K'Varn is going to go ahead and

03:57:36.085 --> 03:57:46.405
fire three additional rays. All right. The kind of
pinkish-red ray streaks across and is going to

03:57:46.405 --> 03:57:50.450
slam into you. Go ahead and make your saving
throw.

03:57:50.450 --> 03:57:52.005
ASHLEY: She's all the way up there.

03:57:52.005 --> 03:57:55.062
MATT: It's going to be a wisdom saving throw with
advantage.

03:57:55.062 --> 03:57:59.829
LAURA: 21.

03:57:59.829 --> 03:58:04.759
MATT: 21. The beam comes across, hits you in the
shoulder, kind of goes across the front of your

03:58:04.759 --> 03:58:11.225
chest. For a moment, you feel this kind of
bloodthirsty urge fill you and you just wince and

03:58:11.225 --> 03:58:12.471
feel it wash over your body.

03:58:12.471 --> 03:58:13.919
TRAVIS: Oh, thank god.

03:58:13.919 --> 03:58:28.045
MATT: All right. The second ray. Reroll that.
All right. The second one is going to go ahead and

03:58:28.124 --> 03:58:36.955
streak down towards Grog. Grog, I need you to go
ahead and make a dexterity check. With, I'll say

03:58:36.955 --> 03:58:38.966
disadvantage 'cause you're on the ground.

03:58:38.966 --> 03:58:41.533
TALIESIN: But the advantage cancels-- advantage?

03:58:41.533 --> 03:58:43.495
MATT: Sure, so it'd be just a regular roll.

03:58:43.495 --> 03:58:44.571
TRAVIS: Five?

03:58:44.571 --> 03:58:45.648
MATT: Five? All right.

03:58:45.648 --> 03:58:46.805
TALIESIN: Regular roll?

03:58:46.805 --> 03:58:51.333
MATT: That was his first roll. Regular roll, yeah.
All right.

03:58:51.333 --> 03:58:52.949
SAM: That's a strong five.

03:58:52.949 --> 03:58:59.804
TRAVIS: That's a pissed-off goliath five. (laughs)
I am Kerri Strug.

03:58:59.804 --> 03:59:05.292
MATT: All right. Grog, you take 61 points of
damage.

03:59:05.292 --> 03:59:08.129
ASHLEY: 61 points of damage?

03:59:08.129 --> 03:59:16.733
MATT: As the black ray that is carrying that heavy
aura of shadow, just beams into the ground,

03:59:16.733 --> 03:59:18.540
slamming into your torso.

03:59:18.540 --> 03:59:19.872
LAURA: What are you at?

03:59:19.872 --> 03:59:21.032
TRAVIS: 13.

03:59:21.032 --> 03:59:25.993
ASHLEY: Oh no!

03:59:25.993 --> 03:59:28.561
TRAVIS: Thanks for the Death Ward. (laughs)

03:59:29.201 --> 03:59:38.966
MATT: Second ray into Grog. He touched the horn
and really pissed it off. All right. Go ahead and

03:59:38.966 --> 03:59:41.079
make a constitution saving throw, Grog.

03:59:41.079 --> 03:59:44.609
ASHLEY: Come on, buddy.

03:59:44.609 --> 03:59:45.728
TRAVIS: 13.

03:59:45.728 --> 03:59:52.343
MATT: 13? A secondary beam, this one like a deep
reddish-brown color, slams into your torso. You

03:59:52.343 --> 03:59:55.117
take 36 points of necrotic damage.

03:59:55.117 --> 03:59:56.821
SAM: Death Ward.

03:59:56.821 --> 03:59:59.090
TRAVIS: Death Ward is activated?

03:59:59.090 --> 04:00:06.910
MATT: All right, so as the beam is about to blast
your body into severe shock, you feel that surge

04:00:06.910 --> 04:00:12.780
of Sarenrae's energy guide over you and pull back
with one hit point left. K'Varn, frustrated, looks

04:00:12.875 --> 04:00:16.700
down at you with your eyes still open and goes,
"No!"

04:00:16.700 --> 04:00:19.576
ASHLEY: Yes!

04:00:19.576 --> 04:00:25.155
TRAVIS: Fucking done.

04:00:25.155 --> 04:00:27.086
MATT: 22, all right.

04:00:27.086 --> 04:00:30.386
MARISHA: Can someone handle the fucking meatball?

04:00:30.386 --> 04:00:31.534
TRAVIS: One, one.

04:00:31.534 --> 04:00:36.056
MATT: Go ahead and make a strength saving throw,
Grog.

04:00:36.056 --> 04:00:38.931
LAURA: Ugh. Again? He's getting it again?

04:00:38.931 --> 04:00:40.351
ASHLEY AND TRAVIS: Natural 20!

04:00:40.351 --> 04:00:43.789
(cheering)

04:00:43.789 --> 04:00:47.318
MATT: The ray slams into your body. You can see
the telekinesis beam trying to move you. But for

04:00:47.318 --> 04:00:49.508
the moment you're just too heavy.

04:00:49.508 --> 04:00:51.328
(laughter)

04:00:51.328 --> 04:00:56.620
MATT: That's going to end K'Varn's turn. That
brings us to Clarota. Clarota's going to go ahead

04:00:56.620 --> 04:01:02.992
and pull back further, here. Actually, no.
Clarota's going to-- Hold on, let's see if he gets

04:01:02.992 --> 04:01:06.765
his Mind Blast back. Nope. He's going to go ahead
and attempt another Lightning Bolt.

04:01:06.765 --> 04:01:12.644
ASHLEY: I'm so stressed out.

04:01:17.337 --> 04:01:20.020
LIAM: I've never looked so intensely at a little
plastic toy.

04:01:20.258 --> 04:01:24.406
LAURA: (laughs) I know.

04:01:24.406 --> 04:01:26.348
TALIESIN: Fuck you, little plastic toy. You're not
the boss of me.

04:01:26.348 --> 04:01:28.711
TRAVIS: I can't even look at it. I've been looking
down.

04:01:28.711 --> 04:01:31.046
MATT: 14 points of lightning damage against
K'Varn.

04:01:31.046 --> 04:01:33.515
LIAM: Full view of the eyeball, like, "Fuck you".

04:01:33.515 --> 04:01:36.783
MATT: At the end of Clarota's turn, K'Varn's going
to use a legendary action to fire another beam at

04:01:36.783 --> 04:01:38.106
Grog.

04:01:38.106 --> 04:01:39.785
SAM: Oh my god.

04:01:39.785 --> 04:01:41.341
LAURA: He hates you, Grog.

04:01:41.341 --> 04:01:43.042
SAM: Is this an automatic hit?

04:01:43.042 --> 04:01:48.583
MATT: Yeah, all the beams automatically hit. Go
ahead and make another dexterity saving throw.

04:01:48.583 --> 04:01:50.893
SAM: Dexterity. That's your good die.

04:01:50.893 --> 04:01:53.965
TRAVIS: 18.

04:01:53.965 --> 04:02:03.271
MATT: 18. That same, fuzzing black ray comes back
again for a second streak, slamming into you. As

04:02:03.271 --> 04:02:13.665
it hits you, you feel this sucking cold sensation
as the soul is pulled from your body, lifeless on

04:02:13.665 --> 04:02:22.559
the ground. The light left Grog's eyes, laying
slain on the floor of the temple. As that necrotic

04:02:22.559 --> 04:02:28.194
energy kind of drifts off of Grog, it pulls into
the horn, and K'Varn, you notice, the wounds begin

04:02:28.194 --> 04:02:41.730
to seal up a little bit, and a chuckle comes out.
"Who's next?" Percy, you're up.

04:02:41.730 --> 04:02:49.846
TALIESIN: Okay, weird question. (laughs) All
right, we've got a giant spiral machine hanging by

04:02:49.846 --> 04:02:51.790
two chains right now.

04:02:51.790 --> 04:02:52.861
MATT: Yes.

04:02:52.861 --> 04:02:55.877
TALIESIN: I'm going to peek over the edge. And is
there a way that if I happen to snap one of those

04:02:55.877 --> 04:03:00.645
chains that that thing would go slamming into
him?

04:03:00.645 --> 04:03:03.132
MATT: Very possible.

04:03:03.132 --> 04:03:06.445
TALIESIN: I'm going to pull over and make that
shot. I'm going to steady myself, sit down, and

04:03:06.445 --> 04:03:07.866
I'm going to make that shot.

04:03:07.866 --> 04:03:11.295
MATT: Okay. Bad News aimed up. You're aiming--
You're probably going to have to move around to

04:03:11.295 --> 04:03:12.383
this side.

04:03:12.383 --> 04:03:13.662
TALIESIN: Fine.

04:03:13.662 --> 04:03:16.188
MATT: Which is very careful, around the two of
them-- Oh, actually,

04:03:16.188 --> 04:03:17.460
you'd probably go around this side.

04:03:17.460 --> 04:03:18.429
TALIESIN: I go around the other way.

04:03:18.429 --> 04:03:20.548
MATT: Yeah, so you make your way to here. You
kneel down with the Bad News. You aim for one of

04:03:20.548 --> 04:03:28.516
the weak points of the metal, bent and ruined from
the swinging of the platform. You grabbed that

04:03:28.516 --> 04:03:30.788
horn, Grog.

04:03:30.788 --> 04:03:32.565
TALIESIN: 17.

04:03:32.565 --> 04:03:35.676
MATT: 17? Does not hit.

04:03:35.676 --> 04:03:37.366
TALIESIN: Does not hit a not-moving target?

04:03:37.366 --> 04:03:39.570
MATT: Oh, no no. I was thinking of his AC. That
hits the platform, I'm so dumb.

04:03:39.570 --> 04:03:40.502
TALIESIN: So-- Thank you.

04:03:40.502 --> 04:03:44.073
MATT: Yes, that does hit. Go ahead and roll
damage.

04:03:44.073 --> 04:03:47.786
TALIESIN: Seven, eight, nine, ten. 15 points of
damage.

04:03:47.786 --> 04:03:53.614
MATT: 15 points of damage? Go ahead and make a
constitution save as the blast of the Bad News

04:03:53.614 --> 04:03:55.452
threatens to push you back.

04:03:55.452 --> 04:03:56.764
TALIESIN: 20.

04:03:56.764 --> 04:04:01.563
MATT: Keeping your low stance, you keep yourself,
with strain, on the top. The blast hits the side

04:04:01.563 --> 04:04:08.243
of the metal. The metal streaks and breaks and
snaps. The single bit of the contraption swings

04:04:08.243 --> 04:04:15.992
widely, slamming into the side of K'Varn. K'Varn
does not make his dexterity saving throw.

04:04:15.992 --> 04:04:17.704
TALIESIN: Yes!

04:04:17.704 --> 04:04:19.519
ORION: Very good.

04:04:19.519 --> 04:04:28.030
MATT: K'Varn takes 36 points of damage. The blast
of the arcane nature of the contraption and the

04:04:28.030 --> 04:04:34.271
impact from-- It slams into him, pushing him all
the way to the side over here. So, leaving you

04:04:34.271 --> 04:04:39.052
right where you were, there. And you can see now,
part of the metal armor has completely been

04:04:39.052 --> 04:04:45.146
destroyed by the impact. So the AC actually lowers
for K'Varn, and he's looking pretty rough.

04:04:45.146 --> 04:04:47.564
TALIESIN: Cool. Bonus action. I'm shooting him
again.

04:04:47.564 --> 04:04:49.321
MATT: Oh, you mean the Action Surge?

04:04:49.321 --> 04:04:50.548
TALIESIN: Action Surge.

04:04:50.548 --> 04:04:52.517
MATT: Okay, 'cause you used your second attack to
reload.

04:04:52.517 --> 04:04:55.107
TALIESIN: Yeah. Well, I used my second attack to
reload. Now I'm on my-- Yeah.

04:04:55.107 --> 04:05:00.523
MATT: You-- Unfortunately, from your position,
since it slammed in this direction, you don't have

04:05:00.523 --> 04:05:04.007
eyesight on him, unless he's considered having
cover right now.

04:05:04.007 --> 04:05:07.584
TALIESIN: Have I actually moved all six of my--
All six of my spaces for movement?

04:05:07.584 --> 04:05:12.007
MATT: To move around the whole platform? Yeah, you
would have had to. You can still fire, but he'll

04:05:12.007 --> 04:05:14.051
have three-quarters cover.

04:05:14.051 --> 04:05:16.015
TALIESIN: I ignore three-quarters cover!

04:05:16.015 --> 04:05:17.656
MATT: Then fucking fire.

04:05:17.656 --> 04:05:24.752
TALIESIN: Thank you. All right. I'm spending the
last of my Grit to do yet another head shot.

04:05:24.752 --> 04:05:26.034
MATT: Okay.

04:05:26.034 --> 04:05:27.566
MARISHA: Come on, Percy.

04:05:27.566 --> 04:05:29.455
LAURA: Isn't he just a giant head?

04:05:29.455 --> 04:05:31.471
TALIESIN: Technically, it's a head shot. It has an
effect.

04:05:31.471 --> 04:05:32.678
LAURA: Okay.

04:05:32.678 --> 04:05:36.872
TALIESIN: I'm shooting him in the eyeball,
basically. That's a 29 to hit.

04:05:36.872 --> 04:05:38.652
MATT: That hits.

04:05:38.652 --> 04:05:44.496
TALIESIN: That's 18 points of damage.

04:05:44.496 --> 04:05:47.189
MATT: 18 points of damage? All right.

04:05:47.189 --> 04:05:50.094
TALIESIN: 18 points of damage, plus the same
thing. Everyone gets this--

04:05:50.094 --> 04:05:51.443
So everyone gets advantage.

04:05:51.443 --> 04:05:55.679
MATT: That's so obnoxious! All right. That's
Percy's turn. Pike, you're up.

04:05:55.679 --> 04:05:58.879
ASHLEY: Okay, I'm going to-- Can I run over to
Grog?

04:05:58.879 --> 04:06:02.469
MATT: You can try to go ahead and-- You have to
try and break the--

04:06:02.469 --> 04:06:04.786
ASHLEY: The grapple was off.

04:06:04.786 --> 04:06:08.718
MATT: That's right, 'cause the grapple guy got
hit. All right, yeah, so you can go do that. Move

04:06:08.718 --> 04:06:09.781
over to Grog?

04:06:09.781 --> 04:06:12.381
SAM: Come on, Matt, can't you remember where ten
people are at once?

04:06:12.381 --> 04:06:16.008
MATT: 11, technically.

04:06:16.008 --> 04:06:22.016
ASHLEY: I'm going to try this. I'm going to put my
hands on him. Try to cast Revivify.

04:06:22.016 --> 04:06:26.229
MATT: Okay. So as you reach over, you grab your
holy symbol, which, looking down at it, you can

04:06:26.229 --> 04:06:31.025
see that crack is still ominously in the symbol.
But you reach down, you pray

04:06:31.025 --> 04:06:32.424
to Sarenrae to aid you.

04:06:32.424 --> 04:06:33.884
ASHLEY: But he put it in the Mending Wheel!

04:06:33.884 --> 04:06:34.631
MATT: Huh?

04:06:34.631 --> 04:06:35.515
ASHLEY: He put it in the Mending Wheel.

04:06:35.515 --> 04:06:36.501
LAURA: No, remember it didn't work.

04:06:36.501 --> 04:06:38.130
ASHLEY: It didn't work? Okay, never mind.

04:06:38.130 --> 04:06:45.362
MATT: You reach down and touch Grog, and his cold,
still body-- You feel the divine energy begin to

04:06:45.362 --> 04:06:51.875
instill his form. I need you to go ahead and make
a wisdom check.

04:06:51.875 --> 04:06:55.721
ASHLEY: And I have Gnome Cunning, so I get to-- I
get advantage on wisdom checks.

04:06:55.721 --> 04:06:58.993
MATT: Yes you do. From which one? From Gnome's
Cunning?

04:06:58.993 --> 04:07:01.268
ASHLEY: Yeah. So what do I add?

04:07:01.268 --> 04:07:03.234
LAURA: Wisdom, I think.

04:07:03.234 --> 04:07:06.947
MATT: For her racial background, she chooses--
she's a deep gnome.

04:07:06.947 --> 04:07:09.912
SAM: She's such a racist. (laughs)

04:07:09.912 --> 04:07:12.394
ASHLEY: 16.

04:07:12.394 --> 04:07:16.254
MATT: 16? Look that up really fast.

04:07:16.254 --> 04:07:18.407
SAM: It's something.

04:07:18.407 --> 04:07:28.503
MATT: Deep gnome, rock gnome? Okay, Gnome Cunning
is you have advantage on all saving throws against

04:07:28.503 --> 04:07:30.892
magic. This was a check.

04:07:30.892 --> 04:07:32.143
ASHLEY: Okay, so that's not a thing.

04:07:32.143 --> 04:07:34.551
LAURA: Oh, well, it's okay. The high-- The first
one was-- It would still be--

04:07:34.551 --> 04:07:35.784
ASHLEY: The first one was 16.

04:07:35.784 --> 04:07:42.004
MATT: 16? Okay. As you put your hands in, you feel
this surge of warmth, and some of the coldness in

04:07:42.004 --> 04:07:49.490
the air is pulled back in as Grog's chest rises up
with breath, once again. Grog, the darkness fades

04:07:49.490 --> 04:07:53.968
and your eyes come clear. You're looking up, on
your back, into the room. You're at one hit point,

04:07:53.968 --> 04:07:55.031
I'm pretty sure.

04:07:55.031 --> 04:07:55.916
TRAVIS: Okay.

04:07:55.916 --> 04:07:57.274
MATT: For Revivify. But you're alive.

04:07:57.274 --> 04:08:00.613
ASHLEY: He needs-- He's one hit point now, so he
needs a potion. Do you have potions?

04:08:00.613 --> 04:08:02.103
LIAM: Do you have a potion for a bonus action?

04:08:02.103 --> 04:08:04.117
TRAVIS: I do, but it's not my turn. Or can I take
a hit dice at any time?

04:08:04.117 --> 04:08:05.616
ASHLEY: Can I give him a potion?

04:08:05.616 --> 04:08:06.958
LIAM: Shove it in his mouth.

04:08:06.958 --> 04:08:07.988
TRAVIS: I have to wait for my turn.

04:08:07.988 --> 04:08:09.198
MATT: He's right there. I'd say, yeah, you can do
that.

04:08:09.198 --> 04:08:12.159
ASHLEY: Okay. I'm going to give him a potion. I'm
going to-- I have a big one.

04:08:12.159 --> 04:08:14.440
LAURA: Yeah, we have a superior.

04:08:14.440 --> 04:08:16.139
ASHLEY: Yeah, I have a superior.

04:08:16.139 --> 04:08:18.535
LAURA: And what does a superior do?

04:08:18.535 --> 04:08:19.677
MATT: Superior is--

04:08:19.677 --> 04:08:22.761
LAURA: It's like 100 hit points, I think?

04:08:22.761 --> 04:08:25.083
MATT: Is 8d4 plus eight.

04:08:25.083 --> 04:08:26.043
TRAVIS: Oh shit.

04:08:26.043 --> 04:08:27.877
MATT: That'll do.

04:08:27.877 --> 04:08:33.860
TRAVIS: Why didn't I buy one of those?

04:08:43.300 --> 04:08:55.153
SAM: Now you have 3 hit points. Come on, Grog.
Don't die. Again.

04:08:55.230 --> 04:08:57.323
TRAVIS: (laughs) I'm trying not to.

04:08:57.323 --> 04:08:58.753
MATT: What's the amount? What you got?

04:08:58.753 --> 04:09:01.342
TRAVIS: I thought the horn was like a party hat.
Like you could just yank it off.

04:09:01.342 --> 04:09:02.890
SAM: (high-pitched) Yeah, yeah. It seemed totally
reasonable.

04:09:02.890 --> 04:09:04.266
TALIESIN: We were with you. We were totally with
you.

04:09:04.266 --> 04:09:07.077
TRAVIS: Wasn't he-- It wasn't even his. He's
like-- I thought he was wearing it. The fucker's

04:09:07.077 --> 04:09:07.903
on there.

04:09:07.903 --> 04:09:08.624
ASHLEY: 25.

04:09:08.624 --> 04:09:09.696
MATT: 25. All right.

04:09:09.696 --> 04:09:10.890
TRAVIS: Way better than one.

04:09:10.890 --> 04:09:13.044
ASHLEY: Okay. It's something.

04:09:13.044 --> 04:09:16.972
MATT: Go. All right. At the end of your turn,
Pike, K'Varn is angrily going to use a legendary

04:09:16.972 --> 04:09:22.696
action to go ahead and fire another beam at you,
since you went ahead and healed him up. All right,

04:09:22.696 --> 04:09:25.396
go ahead and make a dexterity saving throw.

04:09:25.396 --> 04:09:27.561
TALIESIN AND MATT: With advantage.

04:09:27.561 --> 04:09:32.212
ASHLEY: Okay. 19.

04:09:32.212 --> 04:09:36.639
MATT: 19. You manage to dodge out of the way
before it hits the stone around you, carving just

04:09:36.639 --> 04:09:41.723
past Grog. No effect. However, where it hits the
stone, you can see the stone is carved in this

04:09:41.723 --> 04:09:44.699
giant groove, like the beam itself is like a giant
welding torch.

04:09:44.699 --> 04:09:45.800
ASHLEY: Thank god.

04:09:45.800 --> 04:09:47.650
MATT: That ends your turn. Scanlan.

04:09:47.650 --> 04:09:56.549
SAM: Ah! Hey! Oh, hi guys. Do I blind it or do I
attack it?

04:09:56.549 --> 04:09:59.261
LAURA: Blind it. No, I don't know.

04:09:59.261 --> 04:10:01.080
SAM: Is he looking at me?

04:10:01.080 --> 04:10:02.868
TRAVIS: Where are you?

04:10:02.868 --> 04:10:08.148
MATT: You are down here. He's not currently really
looking at-- Actually, no. He was looking down at

04:10:08.148 --> 04:10:11.233
them. So it's that-- So yeah, you'd be in the
current cone.

04:10:11.233 --> 04:10:13.133
TRAVIS: Or get out of his eyesight. Remember, your
magic--

04:10:13.133 --> 04:10:14.535
SAM: I'm going to blind his big eye.

04:10:14.535 --> 04:10:16.637
LIAM: With what?

04:10:16.637 --> 04:10:17.812
SAM: With Blindness.

04:10:17.812 --> 04:10:19.970
MATT: You would have to move. You're currently in
his eyesight.

04:10:19.970 --> 04:10:21.808
SAM: Oh, he can see me? I'm in his field of
vision?

04:10:21.808 --> 04:10:22.592
MATT: Yeah.

04:10:22.592 --> 04:10:23.641
SAM: Oh, then never mind.

04:10:23.641 --> 04:10:24.536
LAURA: You can move.

04:10:24.536 --> 04:10:25.924
LIAM: Move out of the way.

04:10:25.924 --> 04:10:26.793
TRAVIS: Just move to the right.

04:10:26.793 --> 04:10:27.455
LAURA: Yeah.

04:10:27.455 --> 04:10:29.088
LIAM: Move out of the cone.

04:10:29.088 --> 04:10:30.298
SAM: Okay, I'll move out of the cone.

04:10:30.298 --> 04:10:32.642
LIAM: Past Clarota. Maybe out--

04:10:32.642 --> 04:10:34.431
SAM: And now I try to blind him.

04:10:34.431 --> 04:10:35.560
MATT: All right.

04:10:35.560 --> 04:10:37.808
SAM: Wait, I-- Through the Hand Cone of Clarity,
of course.

04:10:37.808 --> 04:10:42.064
MATT: All right. That is a 20. What is your DC?

04:10:42.064 --> 04:10:44.302
SAM: (sings) Blinded by the light.

04:10:44.302 --> 04:10:48.668
ALL: (sings) Wrapped up like a douche, another
roller in the night.

04:10:48.668 --> 04:10:50.395
MATT: What's the DC of your spell?

04:10:50.395 --> 04:10:51.559
SAM: 19.

04:10:51.559 --> 04:10:52.575
MATT: He rolled a 20.

04:10:52.575 --> 04:10:53.991
SAM: Fuck you.

04:10:53.991 --> 04:10:55.638
MATT: "Yes."

04:10:55.638 --> 04:10:56.722
ASHLEY: Shit.

04:10:56.722 --> 04:10:59.721
MATT: As you release the spell, the eyestalks turn
and you can see the darkness that normally fades

04:10:59.721 --> 04:11:03.254
over the eyes just gloss over and dissipate.

04:11:03.254 --> 04:11:07.481
SAM: Great. Well then, as my bonus action, I'll
give Grog just a little bit more healing.

04:11:07.481 --> 04:11:08.920
TRAVIS: Yeah, thanks.

04:11:08.920 --> 04:11:10.351
SAM: Six more.

04:11:10.351 --> 04:11:11.741
TRAVIS: Take it. Thank you, sir.

04:11:11.741 --> 04:11:23.619
MATT: All right. It's now Kima's turn. Kima's
going to hold off, looks over at Keyleth and says,

04:11:23.619 --> 04:11:26.768
"If you can give me another one of those tosses
like you gave Grog?"

04:11:26.768 --> 04:11:29.534
MARISHA: (grunting affirmatively)

04:11:29.534 --> 04:11:33.569
MATT: Kima holds. Back at the top of the round.

04:11:33.569 --> 04:11:37.389
SAM: She's in human form, by the way. (laughs)
It's just how she talks.

04:11:37.389 --> 04:11:42.473
MARISHA: My turn? Is it my turn? Sure. I'll go
ahead-- Since she's a tiny dwarf, I'll--

04:11:42.473 --> 04:11:46.070
MATT: All right, go ahead make an athletics
check.

04:11:46.070 --> 04:11:52.847
MARISHA: What's that, just a strength check as an
elemental, I guess?

04:11:52.847 --> 04:11:54.808
MATT: Yeah, add five to the d20 roll.

04:11:54.808 --> 04:11:56.687
MARISHA: 23.

04:11:56.687 --> 04:12:04.511
MATT: 23. All right. You send Kima flying in the
air, maul arcing through the sky. As she arcs the

04:12:04.511 --> 04:12:13.184
mark above her, a giant flash of divine energy,
just kind of sparks in-- Is left behind her like a

04:12:13.184 --> 04:12:23.554
giant trail through the sky. She brings the hammer
down towards K'Varn. That is a 21, that hits. As

04:12:23.554 --> 04:12:29.516
she slams into it, Kima-- Go ahead and throw-- Is
going to go ahead and throw a 3rd-level spell into

04:12:29.516 --> 04:12:40.764
Divine Smite, doing an additional 3d8 damage on
top of that. That'll be

04:12:40.764 --> 04:12:42.982
38 points of divine damage.

04:12:42.982 --> 04:12:44.567
SAM: That's great.

04:12:44.567 --> 04:12:47.959
MATT: Slamming into the side, knocking teeth out.
You can see, now, portions of the eye starting to

04:12:47.959 --> 04:12:58.237
swell. K'Varn's looking pretty rough. Kima,
however, just continues to go and attempts to land--

04:12:58.237 --> 04:13:09.584
Does not make the athletics check and takes--
Okay, that'll be 22 points of damage from the

04:13:09.584 --> 04:13:12.134
fall. And is prone.

04:13:12.134 --> 04:13:13.467
SAM: From the fall?

04:13:13.467 --> 04:13:16.812
MATT: But is happy with the damage that she dealt.
Grog.

04:13:16.812 --> 04:13:17.894
TRAVIS: Yes?

04:13:17.894 --> 04:13:19.291
MATT: It's your turn.

04:13:19.291 --> 04:13:20.836
SAM: Run. Away.

04:13:20.836 --> 04:13:24.452
TRAVIS: Am I still prone?

04:13:24.452 --> 04:13:25.995
MATT: You are, yes.

04:13:25.995 --> 04:13:27.128
TRAVIS: Can I stand up?

04:13:27.128 --> 04:13:28.959
MATT: You can. That's your movement to get up.

04:13:28.959 --> 04:13:30.333
TRAVIS: That's my movement to get up?

04:13:30.333 --> 04:13:31.284
MATT: Yeah.

04:13:31.284 --> 04:13:35.123
TRAVIS: God, son of a bitch. He's looking at me,
right?

04:13:35.123 --> 04:13:39.030
MATT: He's kind of looking in that direction. Not
directly down at you.

04:13:39.030 --> 04:13:41.283
TRAVIS: But I'm in the cone of shit?

04:13:41.283 --> 04:13:43.533
MATT: You're just on the cusp of it, yeah.

04:13:43.533 --> 04:13:48.898
TRAVIS: Can I use the Chain of Returning to throw
my axe at him?

04:13:48.898 --> 04:13:50.928
MATT: You can.

04:13:50.928 --> 04:13:54.701
TRAVIS: Yeah, 'cause I can't move anywhere,
right?

04:13:54.701 --> 04:13:56.193
MATT: Technically, no.

04:13:56.193 --> 04:13:57.819
SAM: You can heal yourself.

04:13:57.819 --> 04:14:00.634
TRAVIS: I think-- Can I use it-- Can I heal myself
after I throw it? Can I?

04:14:00.634 --> 04:14:02.811
Or is it one or the other?

04:14:02.811 --> 04:14:10.578
MATT: Put it this way. Since you stood up, you're
now like cusping in the cone-- The anti-magic

04:14:10.578 --> 04:14:16.682
cone. Any potions drank in that area will have no
effect. Magic, the actual potions, are dispelled.

04:14:16.682 --> 04:14:21.944
TRAVIS: I had to stand up. Let's throw an axe.

04:14:21.944 --> 04:14:24.866
MATT: All right. Go ahead and roll to attack.

04:14:24.866 --> 04:14:27.072
MARISHA: It's like Ren Faire.

04:14:27.072 --> 04:14:29.283
TRAVIS: A one.

04:14:29.283 --> 04:14:38.878
MATT: As you reach back, you lob the axe. The
Chain of Returning, now also in the cone of

04:14:38.878 --> 04:14:46.282
anti-magic, just snaps off the axe. The axe goes
flying across the room, clattering to the ground

04:14:46.282 --> 04:14:49.581
underneath the corner over here.

04:14:49.581 --> 04:14:52.105
ASHLEY: We're going to die.

04:14:52.105 --> 04:14:54.206
LAURA: He's almost dead, he's almost dead.

04:14:54.206 --> 04:14:56.161
TRAVIS: The Chain of Returning's magic?

04:14:56.161 --> 04:14:58.595
SAM: He's almost dead until he kills.

04:14:58.595 --> 04:15:00.494
MARISHA: Anything that has a name, like Chain of
Something.

04:15:00.494 --> 04:15:02.185
MATT: Tiberius.

04:15:02.185 --> 04:15:04.057
TRAVIS: I was like, just, Chain of Cool. Awesome.

04:15:04.057 --> 04:15:05.366
SAM: Are you still running for Congress out
there?

04:15:05.366 --> 04:15:06.720
MARISHA: Chain of Dope.

04:15:06.720 --> 04:15:09.621
ORION: I'm not-- That's probably not going to
work. I head back up to the top. Actually, no, I

04:15:09.621 --> 04:15:18.016
don't. I go to the side of the temple where the
rope that I was throwing earlier goes and meets

04:15:18.016 --> 04:15:20.207
down to the floor. So I--

04:15:20.207 --> 04:15:24.668
MATT: Okay, so you head down towards the base of
the temple.

04:15:24.668 --> 04:15:29.301
ORION: Yeah. I will-- No, I-- Fuck, no. Hold on a
second, I don't do that. I redact that.

04:15:29.301 --> 04:15:30.714
MATT: Okay.

04:15:30.714 --> 04:15:42.116
ORION: I have the fucking carpet, okay. I go back
to the top. I can get up there, right, like where

04:15:42.116 --> 04:15:43.456
they are?

04:15:43.456 --> 04:15:45.056
LIAM: You should lob a Fireball.

04:15:45.056 --> 04:15:48.188
LAURA: Yeah, just throw a Fireball from the
outside, just throw one.

04:15:48.188 --> 04:15:52.665
ORION: Does he see me?

04:15:52.665 --> 04:15:57.607
MATT: I mean, you're visible up here. You can see
him, he can see you.

04:15:57.607 --> 04:16:00.601
LAURA: But you're not in the cone. He's looking
down.

04:16:00.601 --> 04:16:03.576
ORION: That's what I mean, like is he looking at
me, right now?

04:16:03.576 --> 04:16:05.261
MATT: He's kind of looking in this direction right
now.

04:16:05.261 --> 04:16:06.792
ORION: Okay.

04:16:06.792 --> 04:16:09.020
LAURA: You're going to get the fucking killing
blow, man.

04:16:09.020 --> 04:16:12.572
ORION: I'm going to cast Telekinesis and rip his
horn off his head.

04:16:12.572 --> 04:16:17.362
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and make the check for
Telekinesis.

04:16:17.362 --> 04:16:31.561
ORION: Well, that doesn't happen. Oh, actually-- I
used that. Yeah, no. That doesn't hit. So I'll

04:16:31.561 --> 04:16:33.707
have to spend another--

04:16:33.707 --> 04:16:37.204
MATT: Okay, so, as you release the Telekinesis,
you pull and pull, but that horn is definitively

04:16:37.204 --> 04:16:38.705
locked in place.

04:16:38.705 --> 04:16:47.250
ORION: Okay. Then I'll spend five more and I'll
attempt to rip off one of his tentacles.

04:16:47.250 --> 04:16:51.436
MATT: Stalks? Okay. Go ahead, make another check.

04:16:51.436 --> 04:16:55.967
ORION: I'm going to check that last one off. Check
this off. I'm blast-- I'm using all these from my

04:16:55.967 --> 04:16:57.325
Ioun stones!

04:16:57.325 --> 04:16:58.242
MATT: Okay.

04:16:58.242 --> 04:17:11.127
ORION: I, yeah. That hits. What is that? My, 20--
Oh no-- Fuck what I said, it's 29.

04:17:11.127 --> 04:17:12.200
MATT: 29?

04:17:12.200 --> 04:17:13.397
ORION: Yeah.

04:17:13.397 --> 04:17:20.017
MATT: All right. So as you pull, one of the eye
stalks gets flung off the body, and you can see

04:17:20.017 --> 04:17:24.067
this, like, spurt of brackish blood that spills
across the area nearby.

04:17:24.067 --> 04:17:26.213
MARISHA: Oh, I hope it was a Disintegration ray
one.

04:17:26.213 --> 04:17:28.000
MATT: Go ahead and roll 3d6.

04:17:28.000 --> 04:17:29.295
ORION: Oh, it does damage?

04:17:29.295 --> 04:17:31.542
MATT: Yep.

04:17:31.542 --> 04:17:32.715
ORION: Four.

04:17:32.715 --> 04:17:35.825
MATT: Four damage. All right, Tiberius. Ends your
turn.

04:17:35.825 --> 04:17:39.431
ORION: And I hop off the carpet and I leave it
there.

04:17:39.431 --> 04:17:40.700
MATT: Okay.

04:17:40.700 --> 04:17:44.116
ORION: Or, I hand it to-- Who's next to me? Uh,
you.

04:17:44.116 --> 04:17:47.269
LAURA: Just, yeah, just let-- The carpet there.

04:17:47.269 --> 04:17:52.437
MATT: Vex, you're up.

04:17:52.437 --> 04:17:53.960
LAURA: I thought Vax was up before me.

04:17:53.960 --> 04:17:54.775
LIAM: Vax is up?

04:17:54.775 --> 04:17:56.110
MATT: Oh yeah, Vax is first, sorry. Go ahead.

04:17:56.110 --> 04:18:00.665
LIAM: I am? And Keyleth has already done her
fastball special, that couldn't happen again at

04:18:00.665 --> 04:18:01.764
the moment?

04:18:01.764 --> 04:18:02.688
MATT: Correct.

04:18:02.688 --> 04:18:08.081
LIAM: All right, so dagger-dagger-dagger. Okay.
That's 26 to hit for the dagger?

04:18:08.081 --> 04:18:11.220
MATT: (mouths) Thank you for your patience. Boss
battle.

04:18:11.220 --> 04:18:11.868
LIAM: Hmm?

04:18:11.868 --> 04:18:13.218
MATT: I was thanking them for their patience.

04:18:13.218 --> 04:18:14.096
LIAM: Oh, sure sure. 26.

04:18:14.096 --> 04:18:14.951
MATT: 26 hits.

04:18:14.951 --> 04:18:16.210
LIAM: I don't know if I'm in his cone or not.

04:18:16.210 --> 04:18:17.063
MATT: You are not.

04:18:17.063 --> 04:18:18.618
LIAM: If I'm not in his cone then that's a ten of
damage.

04:18:18.618 --> 04:18:19.779
MATT: All right.

04:18:19.779 --> 04:18:27.467
LIAM: The next is-- I'm going to use a Luck point,
because I have one more. And I get 20--

04:18:27.467 --> 04:18:29.075
MATT: That's your last Luck point, by the way.
That was three.

04:18:29.075 --> 04:18:30.115
LIAM: Yes, 25. Okay.

04:18:30.115 --> 04:18:31.164
MATT: All right.

04:18:31.164 --> 04:18:39.033
LIAM: Which is ten of damage, and the last dagger
is a one, so it just flies away.

04:18:39.033 --> 04:18:44.039
MATT: All right. All right, so you chuck the
daggers up, they kind of cascade off, one of them

04:18:44.039 --> 04:18:47.038
manages to slam into the side. You pull them back
to your belt and get ready for the next round.

04:18:47.038 --> 04:18:48.481
Vex, you're up.

04:18:48.481 --> 04:18:59.810
LAURA: Okay. I'm going to shoot an arrow at him.
Hail of Thorns as a level three. That is, doesn't

04:18:59.810 --> 04:19:01.499
hit. That's a 14.

04:19:01.499 --> 04:19:05.973
MATT: 14, unfortunately, no. It hits the side of
the wall. Explodes, sending a series of wooden

04:19:05.973 --> 04:19:08.365
spikes into the stone on the side of the temple.

04:19:08.365 --> 04:19:12.897
LAURA: Okay, cool. I can't do that again, can I?
All right, then I'm just gonna shoot him through

04:19:12.897 --> 04:19:14.276
the flaming bow.

04:19:14.276 --> 04:19:16.640
MATT: You used flaming bow twice already, so you
no longer can use it.

04:19:16.640 --> 04:19:22.976
LAURA: I'm not going to use it. I'm just going to
shoot him. This is fun, guys. 23.

04:19:22.976 --> 04:19:25.198
MATT: 23 hits. Go and roll damage with your
Hunter's Mark.

04:19:25.198 --> 04:19:37.091
LAURA: Okay. 13. And 15. 20 points of damage.

04:19:37.170 --> 04:19:42.063
MATT: 20 points of damage. All right.

04:19:42.063 --> 04:19:43.414
How do you want to do this?

04:19:43.414 --> 04:19:47.770
(cheering)

04:19:47.770 --> 04:19:54.941
LAURA: I wanna-- Oh god. How do I want to do
this?

04:19:54.941 --> 04:19:56.602
TALIESIN: You want to do it crying, I know that
much.

04:19:56.602 --> 04:20:03.574
LAURA: I do, I'm crying. I want to shoot him-- Is
it possible to shoot him right where the horn

04:20:03.574 --> 04:20:06.222
meets his head and knock it off of him?

04:20:06.222 --> 04:20:07.548
MATT: No.

04:20:07.548 --> 04:20:08.674
(laughter)

04:20:08.674 --> 04:20:10.539
LAURA: All right, then I shoot him straight in the
eyeball.

04:20:10.539 --> 04:20:14.971
MATT: All right, so as K'Varn's looking around,
kind of frantic at this point, realizing that this

04:20:14.971 --> 04:20:19.767
whole swarm of individuals are pouring into the
temple. That, looking around, you can sense that

04:20:19.767 --> 04:20:26.141
the-- It's lost control of the Elder Brain. It
starts just getting extremely manic and--

04:20:26.141 --> 04:20:27.765
LAURA: Vox Machina!

04:20:27.765 --> 04:20:29.465
MARISHA: Vox Machina!

04:20:29.465 --> 04:20:36.113
MATT: Another ray of energy, it glances up at you,
just in time for you to release that final arrow.

04:20:36.113 --> 04:20:43.066
It strikes down, going right into the pupil. The
light blue color immediately bursts into an angry

04:20:43.066 --> 04:20:49.343
red as the eye closes over, trying to contain the
impact. The blood begins to pour out of the front

04:20:49.343 --> 04:20:54.826
of the eye, as the arrow, you can see pierce out
the back side and is jutting about six inches out

04:20:54.826 --> 04:21:05.381
the back of the Beholder. And K'Varn slowly sinks
a few feet and just slams onto the ground.

04:21:05.381 --> 04:21:06.696
TRAVIS: Fuck you, meatball!

04:21:06.696 --> 04:21:10.179
(cheering)

04:21:10.179 --> 04:21:11.197
TRAVIS: Vex!

04:21:11.197 --> 04:21:12.470
TALIESIN: That is how it's done.

04:21:12.470 --> 04:21:13.369
MATT: That ends your turn, Vex.

04:21:13.369 --> 04:21:16.340
LAURA: And I hug Trinket so tight.

04:21:16.340 --> 04:21:24.570
MATT: Okay. So on K'Varn's turn, black energy
begins to pull into the horn, and the beholder

04:21:24.570 --> 04:21:31.031
opens the eye again. Now, the light blue color is
just a pale white and you can see the jaw's a

04:21:31.031 --> 04:21:36.693
little slack. But the horn is now glowing this
intense black color. And the beholder gets back up

04:21:36.693 --> 04:21:37.932
from his position.

04:21:37.932 --> 04:21:40.883
LAURA: Ugh. He's zombie beholder now.

04:21:40.883 --> 04:21:49.474
MATT: At which, Kima's on the ground, says, "Shit!
Orcus! God of undeath, of course!" And she's going

04:21:49.474 --> 04:21:51.392
to start getting ready on her end.

04:21:51.392 --> 04:21:52.730
LIAM: Evil god!

04:21:52.730 --> 04:21:54.640
LAURA: Oh my god, is this like another boss?

04:21:54.640 --> 04:21:57.866
MARISHA: The horn was from Orcus. He's not a
demigod.

04:21:57.866 --> 04:22:01.161
LIAM: Just two more hours. We got this.

04:22:01.161 --> 04:22:12.149
MATT: K'Varn's going to take another ray attack
at-- Let's see. So a dexterity save against-- This

04:22:12.149 --> 04:22:22.078
would be Kima on the ground. Kima fails. Kima's
form begins to slowly turn to stone.

04:22:22.078 --> 04:22:24.404
SAM: (gasps) Oh no, Kima's stoned.

04:22:24.404 --> 04:22:25.997
TRAVIS: She turned to stone?

04:22:25.997 --> 04:22:26.962
SAM: Kima's stoned.

04:22:26.962 --> 04:22:27.973
LAURA: Kima's turning to stone.

04:22:27.973 --> 04:22:37.170
MATT: Her body's like--Secondary one is-- I rolled
that one. All right, can I get a wisdom saving

04:22:37.170 --> 04:22:39.496
throw from you, Vax?

04:22:39.496 --> 04:22:41.292
LIAM: Sure. Sure, I'm not worried.

04:22:41.292 --> 04:22:42.862
MATT: With advantage.

04:22:42.862 --> 04:22:45.775
LIAM: Yes. Natural 20.

04:22:45.775 --> 04:22:47.402
ALL: Oh!

04:22:47.402 --> 04:22:52.234
MATT: A wave of fear hits your mind for a second,
watching it rise up, but you've seen many horrible

04:22:52.234 --> 04:22:58.148
things and it's not enough to shake your will and
resolve. Third one. All right. Can I get a

04:22:58.148 --> 04:23:02.809
dexterity saving throw? This will be from you,
Pike.

04:23:02.809 --> 04:23:04.412
ASHLEY: Okay.

04:23:04.412 --> 04:23:08.902
LIAM: Jump.

04:23:08.902 --> 04:23:11.673
LAURA: No, with advantage.

04:23:11.673 --> 04:23:13.872
LIAM: (sings) With advantage!

04:23:13.872 --> 04:23:15.580
ASHLEY: Ten.

04:23:15.580 --> 04:23:16.924
TRAVIS: Plus your dex, right?

04:23:16.924 --> 04:23:18.915
ASHLEY: I don't add anything.

04:23:18.915 --> 04:23:23.768
MATT: As a dull green ray fires out from the
currently undead K'Varn,

04:23:23.768 --> 04:23:25.899
you take 45 points of damage.

04:23:25.899 --> 04:23:28.163
SAM: That's a lot.

04:23:28.163 --> 04:23:31.415
ASHLEY: Sweet. All right, all right.

04:23:31.415 --> 04:23:32.609
LIAM: Still alive, still alive.

04:23:32.609 --> 04:23:33.510
MATT: You're still conscious?

04:23:33.510 --> 04:23:34.513
LAURA: Yep, she is.

04:23:34.513 --> 04:23:36.505
MATT: Good. (laughs)

04:23:36.505 --> 04:23:37.662
ASHLEY: How many? How many did you say?

04:23:37.662 --> 04:23:38.477
MATT, LIAM, AND LAURA: 45.

04:23:38.477 --> 04:23:39.800
ASHLEY: 45. Okay. Just to be clear.

04:23:39.800 --> 04:23:44.102
TRAVIS: Fuck this!

04:23:44.102 --> 04:23:47.764
TALIESIN: No, this is the end of, like, Iron Man 3
right now. I'm kind of, I'm a little irritated.

04:23:47.764 --> 04:23:49.257
ORION: And that was a terrible movie.

04:23:49.257 --> 04:23:50.544
TALIESIN: I loved it.

04:23:50.544 --> 04:24:00.388
MATT: Clarota is going to run forward and attempt
to to use his tentacles on K'Varn. That's an 18.

04:24:00.388 --> 04:24:02.983
That hits.

04:24:02.983 --> 04:24:04.922
TRAVIS: Come on, Clarota, do it for your fellow
squid.

04:24:04.922 --> 04:24:08.253
MATT: That's 15 points of psychic damage and is
now trying to grapple the tentacles around the

04:24:08.253 --> 04:24:12.598
front of K'Varn-- The side of K'Varn's head. That
brings us to Percy.

04:24:12.598 --> 04:24:14.509
TALIESIN: I'm going to hop on the magic carpet.

04:24:14.509 --> 04:24:15.943
MATT: All right.

04:24:15.943 --> 04:24:24.742
TALIESIN: And start heading in, and I'm going to
get-- I'm going to get myself down and I'm taking

04:24:24.742 --> 04:24:26.759
a shot at the horn.

04:24:26.759 --> 04:24:29.778
MATT: At the horn? All right. This is going to be
at disadvantage.

04:24:29.778 --> 04:24:31.216
TALIESIN: Because I'm so close?

04:24:31.216 --> 04:24:35.140
MATT: Because you're-- Because you're on the
carpet flying down, making a specific shot at a

04:24:35.233 --> 04:24:36.651
very, very tiny object.

04:24:36.651 --> 04:24:38.299
TALIESIN: Okay.

04:24:38.299 --> 04:24:42.702
SAM: Oh look, there's a man with a gun on a flying
carpet, coming in.

04:24:42.702 --> 04:24:43.835
TALIESIN: 18.

04:24:43.835 --> 04:24:45.871
MATT: 18 against the horn, unfortunately, will not
hit.

04:24:45.871 --> 04:24:49.253
TALIESIN: It hadn't been for disadvantage--

04:24:49.253 --> 04:24:54.540
MATT: I know. You-- the carpet kind of juts back
for a second. The shot just ricochets off a few

04:24:54.540 --> 04:24:57.615
walls. You can see a bit of stone getting knocked
off the side.

04:24:57.615 --> 04:24:59.802
End of your turn?

04:24:59.802 --> 04:25:01.241
TALIESIN: That's the end of my turn.

04:25:01.241 --> 04:25:03.361
MATT: All right. Pike.

04:25:03.361 --> 04:25:06.107
ASHLEY: Okay, it's Divine Intervention time.

04:25:06.107 --> 04:25:07.038
SAM: Whoa.

04:25:07.038 --> 04:25:08.057
LAURA: Yeah.

04:25:08.057 --> 04:25:08.899
ASHLEY: I think it's time.

04:25:08.899 --> 04:25:10.971
MATT: All right, so you're using your action to
call on Divine Intervention. How do you want to

04:25:10.971 --> 04:25:17.192
call your deity? It doesn't need to be anything
too specific, it'd be just, "To aid me." Whatever

04:25:17.192 --> 04:25:18.641
you feel like.

04:25:18.641 --> 04:25:22.605
ASHLEY: Just, sort of, aid every--

04:25:22.605 --> 04:25:26.158
MATT: You grab your holy symbol. What do you shout
out to Sarenrae?

04:25:26.158 --> 04:25:28.615
ASHLEY: Help us kill this thing.

04:25:28.615 --> 04:25:42.358
MATT: Go ahead and roll 2d10. Go ahead and-- So
roll the first one. The second one?

04:25:42.358 --> 04:25:44.709
LIAM: 74.

04:25:44.783 --> 04:25:52.761
MATT: So, at this depth, Sarenrae's influence is a
little too far away to come into this moment. And

04:25:52.761 --> 04:25:55.883
you feel the intervention isn't quite strong
enough to really make her presence known at this

04:25:55.883 --> 04:25:59.645
point. But you feel a sense of warmth and comfort
knowing that, at least, she's looking over you,

04:25:59.645 --> 04:26:03.843
but thinks, "You don't need my aid at this
moment."

04:26:03.843 --> 04:26:05.166
LAURA: Yes we do!

04:26:05.166 --> 04:26:06.708
MATT: So that's your action.

04:26:06.708 --> 04:26:09.822
ASHLEY: That's my action, okay. So, now all I can
do is move?

04:26:09.822 --> 04:26:10.988
MATT: Move, bonus action.

04:26:10.988 --> 04:26:17.946
ASHLEY: Can I-- Actually, can I Divine Strike,
also?

04:26:17.946 --> 04:26:20.963
MATT: I believe that's-- I think that's an action,
unfortunately

04:26:20.963 --> 04:26:23.634
ASHLEY: I think that's a-- Okay. All right, well,
I'll just--

04:26:23.634 --> 04:26:25.233
LIAM: Potion? Potion potion potion potion.

04:26:25.233 --> 04:26:26.990
ASHLEY: Oh yeah, I'll take a potion.

04:26:26.990 --> 04:26:30.331
MATT: Okay, go for it. Heal yourself on that. That
brings us to Scanlan.

04:26:30.331 --> 04:26:36.516
SAM: Oh! Lightning Bolt on the thing with the bad
guy. Lightning.

04:26:36.516 --> 04:26:37.905
MATT: Okay.

04:26:37.905 --> 04:26:38.850
SAM: Lightning.

04:26:38.850 --> 04:26:40.049
MATT: All right.

04:26:40.049 --> 04:26:41.366
SAM: That's all I know.

04:26:41.366 --> 04:26:42.568
MATT: All right, Lightning.

04:26:42.568 --> 04:26:44.138
SAM: And hell, I'll do it at a higher level.

04:26:44.138 --> 04:26:45.520
MARISHA: Yes.

04:26:45.520 --> 04:26:46.448
MATT: At what level?

04:26:46.448 --> 04:26:47.811
SAM: Level three.

04:26:47.811 --> 04:26:49.206
MATT: It is level three normally.

04:26:49.206 --> 04:26:50.812
SAM: No, it's level two for me.

04:26:50.812 --> 04:26:52.270
MATT: I think Lightning Bolt is level three.

04:26:52.270 --> 04:26:53.648
SAM: No, I'm sorry, level four. Level four.

04:26:53.648 --> 04:26:56.675
MATT: Okay. So that'll be 9d6.

04:26:56.675 --> 04:26:59.805
SAM: One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

04:26:59.805 --> 04:27:01.703
MATT: Does make his saving throw.

04:27:01.963 --> 04:27:02.921
SAM: Okay, so it's half this?

04:27:02.921 --> 04:27:04.841
TRAVIS: Yeah, come on, buddy.

04:27:04.841 --> 04:27:06.393
SAM: Ah! Lost one.

04:27:06.393 --> 04:27:08.023
LIAM: That's by your feet.

04:27:08.023 --> 04:27:18.760
SAM: Six, seven, eight, nine, ten, 11, 12. 18. 19,
20, 21, 22, 23-- 25, so 12.

04:27:18.760 --> 04:27:22.775
MATT: 25, so 13 points of lightning damage. The
side of K'Varn's undead form. You can see part of

04:27:22.775 --> 04:27:26.558
the flesh is now blown off the side, hanging
limply. Part of the teeth on the inside of the

04:27:26.558 --> 04:27:30.963
mouth are now visible. It's still standing, held
together by the power of the horn.

04:27:30.963 --> 04:27:33.584
SAM: I give some healing to Pike, as well.

04:27:33.584 --> 04:27:34.810
MATT: All right.

04:27:34.810 --> 04:27:40.160
SAM: (sings) Hey! Hey baby, hey baby, hey.

04:27:40.160 --> 04:27:43.558
LAURA: (sings) It's late. It's late.

04:27:43.558 --> 04:27:45.512
SAM: (sings) Hey baby, hey baby, hey.

04:27:45.512 --> 04:27:46.984
ASHLEY: What are you--

04:27:46.984 --> 04:27:48.567
SAM: It's not much. Oh, it's eight.

04:27:48.567 --> 04:27:49.861
ASHLEY: Oh, that's great.

04:27:49.861 --> 04:27:55.062
MATT: Kima and Keyleth. Kima is going to stand
up.

04:27:55.062 --> 04:27:56.395
ASHLEY: Nine? Okay, great.

04:27:56.395 --> 04:27:57.542
SAM: I counted wrong.

04:27:57.542 --> 04:27:59.368
MATT: Unfortunately, because she was prone, that
kind of takes her turn.

04:27:59.368 --> 04:28:01.282
MARISHA: What is the situation?

04:28:01.282 --> 04:28:02.936
MATT: Yes?

04:28:02.936 --> 04:28:04.488
MARISHA: I'm sorry. What was that? What was that?

04:28:04.488 --> 04:28:05.909
MATT: What are you doing?

04:28:05.909 --> 04:28:10.181
MARISHA: What was that situation with the-- The
hanging, you know,

04:28:10.181 --> 04:28:12.169
Metropolitan Museum of Art piece?

04:28:12.169 --> 04:28:16.627
MATT: It's currently dangling right here. Right
above you, precariously.

04:28:16.627 --> 04:28:18.438
LAURA: Oh, good to know.

04:28:18.438 --> 04:28:19.559
LIAM: Oh yeah.

04:28:19.559 --> 04:28:28.969
MARISHA: Can I as a rock monster go up to it and
grab it?

04:28:28.969 --> 04:28:31.695
MATT: You can certainly try. It looks very heavy.

04:28:31.695 --> 04:28:33.979
MARISHA: It's very heavy?

04:28:33.979 --> 04:28:36.146
LIAM: Yeah, so beat it in the face.

04:28:36.146 --> 04:28:38.776
MARISHA: I was going to try and bring it down on
top of K'Varn.

04:28:38.776 --> 04:28:41.291
TALIESIN: Kind of in the middle of a bunch of
stuff.

04:28:41.291 --> 04:28:44.011
MATT: Yeah. The process of doing that will
probably take out a few other people.

04:28:44.011 --> 04:28:46.407
LIAM: Punch the eyeball.

04:28:46.407 --> 04:28:53.157
MARISHA: I'm then just going to run and just do a
double strike. Well, you know what? I'm going to

04:28:53.157 --> 04:28:55.832
run in and just grapple him. I'm going to grapple
him again.

04:28:55.832 --> 04:28:59.086
MATT: All right, go for it. Go ahead and make an
athletics check.

04:28:59.086 --> 04:29:04.014
MARISHA: Nine.

04:29:04.014 --> 04:29:11.756
MATT: Nine? Yeah, no. You just go to reach and the
Beholder just pushes you off. That ends your turn.

04:29:11.756 --> 04:29:17.326
Kima turns to solid stone locked in place.

04:29:17.326 --> 04:29:19.324
LAURA: Oh, Kima!

04:29:19.324 --> 04:29:21.760
MATT: Grog. You have no axe.

04:29:21.760 --> 04:29:29.915
TRAVIS: No, but I got shit in the Bag of Holding.
'Cause I'm a hoarder. Can I get around behind it

04:29:29.915 --> 04:29:36.443
by going to its left-- Between it and the cage?
Can I fit through there?

04:29:36.443 --> 04:29:37.609
MATT: Here?

04:29:37.609 --> 04:29:39.307
TRAVIS: Yeah. Or just to its side, at least?

04:29:39.307 --> 04:29:40.570
MATT: You can get to its side over here, maybe.

04:29:40.570 --> 04:29:41.474
TRAVIS: I'll take the side.

04:29:41.474 --> 04:29:46.467
MATT: All right. You rush over. As you pass by,
this creature steps forward and is going to

04:29:46.467 --> 04:29:52.293
attempt to grapple you. Through the bars, that's
going to be a 14. Go ahead and roll athletics.

04:29:52.293 --> 04:29:56.641
SAM: Come on, you've been working out.

04:29:56.641 --> 04:29:59.209
TRAVIS: Ten.

04:29:59.209 --> 04:30:04.067
MATT: You take seven points of crushing damage,
and are currently grappled.

04:30:04.067 --> 04:30:11.139
TRAVIS: Crushing damage does-- nope. How many was
it? 14?

04:30:11.214 --> 04:30:12.806
MATT: No, you take seven.

04:30:12.806 --> 04:30:13.849
TRAVIS: Seven.

04:30:13.849 --> 04:30:17.205
MATT: You're grappled. You're still next to
K'Varn, you just can't move any further.

04:30:17.205 --> 04:30:19.103
LAURA: So you could still attack him?

04:30:19.103 --> 04:30:20.062
MATT: If you want to.

04:30:20.062 --> 04:30:20.835
TRAVIS: Oh, really?

04:30:20.835 --> 04:30:21.486
MATT: Yeah.

04:30:21.486 --> 04:30:24.886
TRAVIS: Okay, I'd like to take the Greatsword of
Frenzy out of the Bag of Holding.

04:30:24.886 --> 04:30:29.638
MATT: Okay. You can do that with your bonus
action.

04:30:29.638 --> 04:30:34.407
TRAVIS: Shit, I wanted the bonus action to drink a
potion, but fuck it, I'd like to swing at the

04:30:34.407 --> 04:30:35.758
giant little shit.

04:30:35.758 --> 04:30:38.179
MATT: All right. Go for it.

04:30:38.179 --> 04:30:40.511
TRAVIS: 17.

04:30:40.511 --> 04:30:42.605
MATT: 17 does not hit.

04:30:42.605 --> 04:30:47.309
TRAVIS: Oh, 26.

04:30:47.309 --> 04:30:52.142
MATT: That does hit. Then roll 2d6 for the damage,
plus your strength modifier.

04:30:52.142 --> 04:30:53.928
SAM: Hey, that's good.

04:30:53.928 --> 04:30:57.229
TRAVIS: 11, 15.

04:30:57.229 --> 04:31:01.337
MATT: 15 damage, all right. You slice through part
of its body. You can see, now, three stalks slide

04:31:01.337 --> 04:31:05.155
off, and you can see some of the brain tissue
underneath, but yet its still-necrotic form is

04:31:05.155 --> 04:31:07.123
holding it in place.

04:31:07.146 --> 04:31:08.301
MARISHA: Oh.

04:31:08.301 --> 04:31:10.895
MATT: That ends your turn. Who's next? Tiberius.

04:31:10.895 --> 04:31:12.984
ORION: How many stalks does it have left?

04:31:12.984 --> 04:31:16.770
MATT: It has probably nine.

04:31:16.770 --> 04:31:18.314
ORION: Left?

04:31:18.314 --> 04:31:25.713
MATT: Yeah. Covered in stalks, dude. Looking
really rough, though.

04:31:25.713 --> 04:31:28.634
ORION: Okay.

04:31:28.634 --> 04:31:35.037
LAURA: My magic attacks have been using-- Working
from above, Tiberius.

04:31:35.037 --> 04:31:38.602
ORION: Where is it, actually?

04:31:38.602 --> 04:31:39.728
MATT: He's right here.

04:31:39.728 --> 04:31:41.060
ORION: From where-- Oh.

04:31:41.060 --> 04:31:42.848
LAURA: Shoot him.

04:31:42.848 --> 04:31:44.225
LIAM: Zip, zap, zop.

04:31:44.225 --> 04:31:45.371
LAURA: Get 'im.

04:31:45.371 --> 04:31:50.460
ORION: Okay, I'll do a-- I'll shoot a Glacial
Blast at him.

04:31:50.460 --> 04:31:51.944
MATT: All right.

04:31:51.944 --> 04:31:56.969
ORION: Just a concentrated-- I'll spike it right
before it hits him and jam it in his fucking eye.

04:31:56.969 --> 04:31:59.387
MATT: All right. That's a dexterity save, right?

04:31:59.619 --> 04:32:00.396
ORION: Yes.

04:32:00.396 --> 04:32:04.067
MATT: Okay. That's 19. Makes the dexterity save.
Go ahead and roll damage, takes half damage.

04:32:04.067 --> 04:32:09.536
ORION: 6d8. Oh shit, I need d8 for this. Do you
have d8s?

04:32:09.536 --> 04:32:10.748
TALIESIN: Here, d8s.

04:32:10.748 --> 04:32:14.854
MARISHA: I do, Mr. Pack Away Your Dice.

04:32:14.854 --> 04:32:30.181
ORION: I got it. That is 40.

04:32:30.181 --> 04:32:33.408
MATT: 40. So half that is 20 damage?

04:32:33.491 --> 04:32:34.742
How do you want to do this?

04:32:34.742 --> 04:32:36.260
(cheering)

04:32:36.260 --> 04:32:37.668
LAURA: What? What just happened?

04:32:37.668 --> 04:32:40.139
SAM: We're killing him again. But then--

04:32:40.139 --> 04:32:41.096
ORION: What, really?

04:32:41.096 --> 04:32:42.132
LIAM: Three more forms to go.

04:32:42.132 --> 04:32:42.945
ASHLEY: Get it.

04:32:42.945 --> 04:32:44.076
SAM: Two of ten times.

04:32:44.076 --> 04:32:45.316
ORION: Two of ten times. Okay.

04:32:45.316 --> 04:32:46.648
MATT: What are you going to do with your Glacial
Blast?

04:32:46.648 --> 04:32:53.523
ORION: I'll just-- I mean, like I said. Right
before I do it, I'll shape it into an ice spike

04:32:53.523 --> 04:32:55.230
and right through the eye.

04:32:55.230 --> 04:32:59.651
MATT: Okay. So, you take your arcane form, and you
can see, where the impact of the arrow left behind

04:32:59.651 --> 04:33:03.871
from Vex is already still there and the eye's kind
of slightly concave as the wound's open. You take

04:33:03.871 --> 04:33:08.623
the Glacial Blast into one giant jagged piece of
ice and you thrust it forward with all your arcane

04:33:08.623 --> 04:33:14.555
might. It hits and sinks into the eye and as it
streaks to the inside, it bursts from the

04:33:14.555 --> 04:33:22.844
interior. You see ice shards piercing it from the
inside out. As the form kind of lands on the

04:33:22.844 --> 04:33:30.774
ground there, as ice begins to slowly form and
crackle around its outside, you can still see dark

04:33:30.774 --> 04:33:33.205
energy pulling into the horn.

04:33:33.205 --> 04:33:38.777
ORION: Wonderful, while I-- No! I spend five
Sorcerer points and I do Telekinesis and rip the

04:33:38.777 --> 04:33:40.477
horn off his fucking--

04:33:40.477 --> 04:33:41.511
MATT: How many Sorcery points do you have?

04:33:41.511 --> 04:33:42.679
ORION: That's it after that.

04:33:42.679 --> 04:33:44.421
MARISHA: Why not-- I can just rip it off. I'm a
rock dude.

04:33:44.421 --> 04:33:46.283
ORION: It's my turn.

04:33:46.283 --> 04:33:48.800
MATT: All right. Go ahead and make your roll.

04:33:48.800 --> 04:33:57.269
ORION: What is that? Oh, that's 26.

04:33:57.296 --> 04:34:04.873
MATT: 26. With a sickening tearing sound, you
notice the shaking of the horn begin to slowly

04:34:04.873 --> 04:34:11.779
pull from the slightly dilapidated and decomposing
form of K'Varn. As the horn begins to tug and

04:34:11.779 --> 04:34:17.790
tear, the flesh stretches before, eventually, it's
torn from the body. The moment the horn rises up,

04:34:17.790 --> 04:34:23.667
all that black energy dissipates, the horn held
aloft in mid-air. The rest of K'Varn's form slumps

04:34:23.667 --> 04:34:26.165
to the ground and slowly begins to melt away.

04:34:26.165 --> 04:34:27.249
LAURA: Ew.

04:34:27.249 --> 04:34:29.773
ORION: I'll hold it in place for now and kind
of--

04:34:29.773 --> 04:34:33.664
LAURA: What is that?

04:34:33.664 --> 04:34:34.806
MATT: Just slam over its head?

04:34:34.806 --> 04:34:35.444
ORION: Yeah.

04:34:35.444 --> 04:34:37.023
MATT: Okay.

04:34:37.131 --> 04:34:38.114
SAM: Don't touch it to him.

04:34:38.114 --> 04:34:39.270
TRAVIS: No he's-- Telekinesis, is he's--

04:34:39.270 --> 04:34:40.607
SAM: I know. But don't touch it to the thing.

04:34:40.607 --> 04:34:42.070
TRAVIS: Oh. Oh, right. Yes.

04:34:42.070 --> 04:34:44.301
TALIESIN: It's like the thing at the end of Time
Bandits. We should just--

04:34:44.301 --> 04:34:46.235
ORION: Yeah, I just killed it. Don't tell me what
to do, dawg.

04:34:46.235 --> 04:34:49.148
TRAVIS: (laughs) Don't tell me what to do.

04:34:49.148 --> 04:34:53.669
LAURA: I know, you're so ornery. We fucking
brought you back in here. We told you to hit it.

04:34:53.669 --> 04:34:55.045
ORION: Wait 'til we're not fighting.

04:34:55.045 --> 04:34:56.319
LAURA: Crazy.

04:34:56.319 --> 04:34:59.732
MATT: So as K'Varn's horn is now currently held
aloft via your Telekinesis--

04:34:59.732 --> 04:35:03.493
ORION: I hold it here. I don't want to--

04:35:03.493 --> 04:35:09.154
MATT: That ends your turn. It looks like,
currently, the battle, for the moment--

04:35:09.154 --> 04:35:10.768
SAM: For the moment?

04:35:10.768 --> 04:35:14.558
MATT: Is held as you guys sit here in the center
of the temple.

04:35:14.558 --> 04:35:16.893
LAURA: We got a bunch of illithid coming in here
soon.

04:35:16.893 --> 04:35:18.204
MARISHA: Yes, we do.

04:35:18.204 --> 04:35:24.671
MATT: Look about you. The contraption destroyed.
The loose, pale, pulsing glow of the Elder Brain

04:35:24.671 --> 04:35:29.241
slowly glowing brighter and brighter.

04:35:29.241 --> 04:35:31.748
ORION: Oh. As I see that, I'm going to float this
more towards me.

04:35:31.748 --> 04:35:33.745
MATT: Okay.

04:35:33.745 --> 04:35:38.991
ORION: And I take it-- Now, it's hovering above.
I'm going to hold it about 25 feet away from me in

04:35:38.991 --> 04:35:40.144
the air.

04:35:40.144 --> 04:35:41.225
MATT: All right.

04:35:41.225 --> 04:35:46.387
MATT: And from that point, we'll conclude this
evening's epic boss encounter.

04:35:46.387 --> 04:35:47.768
LAURA: Fuck.

04:35:47.768 --> 04:35:48.279
SAM: Wow.

04:35:48.279 --> 04:35:49.102
TALIESIN: Oh god.

04:35:49.102 --> 04:35:50.029
LAURA: Oh my god.

04:35:50.029 --> 04:35:51.166
MATT: Holy shit, guys.

04:35:51.166 --> 04:35:53.985
LAURA: We didn't die!

04:35:53.985 --> 04:35:55.813
TRAVIS: Well, speak for yourself.

04:35:55.813 --> 04:36:00.390
MATT: You did have a death. But you had a spell to
bring him back.

04:36:00.390 --> 04:36:03.037
TRAVIS: Death Ward for the win.

04:36:03.037 --> 04:36:04.369
ORION: Irresponsible--

04:36:04.369 --> 04:36:10.230
MARISHA: Oh, please. Pooper face. You were so
poopy the entire end of that game.

04:36:10.230 --> 04:36:12.425
ORION: You have no idea. You have no idea what you
guys are in for after this.

04:36:12.425 --> 04:36:14.001
MARISHA: Why? What are you-- What are we in for?

04:36:14.001 --> 04:36:15.052
ORION: I'm not going to--

04:36:15.052 --> 04:36:16.609
LAURA: He knows everything.

04:36:16.609 --> 04:36:17.735
ORION: That's not-- That's the next episode.

04:36:17.735 --> 04:36:19.334
MARISHA: I'm with Vex.

04:36:19.334 --> 04:36:26.736
MATT: That was a marathon session. Thank you all for your patience. Thanks for
staying.

04:36:26.822 --> 04:36:28.093
ASHLEY: Thank you guys for sticking out.

04:36:28.093 --> 04:36:29.051
TRAVIS: Yeah, that was a long one.

04:36:29.051 --> 04:36:31.061
LIAM: How many of you are going to have a hard day
at work in the morning?

04:36:31.061 --> 04:36:33.404
ZAC: Guys, I'm just totalling up all the donations
that we had.

04:36:33.404 --> 04:36:34.675
MATT: Fantastic.

04:36:34.675 --> 04:36:35.445
TALIESIN: Yay!

04:36:35.445 --> 04:36:36.365
ORION: Sweet!

04:36:36.365 --> 04:36:39.299
TRAVIS: Good job, Matt. Good. Job.

04:36:39.299 --> 04:36:41.636
LAURA: He was evil.

04:36:41.636 --> 04:36:45.092
MATT: You guys-- Between your head shots--

04:36:45.092 --> 04:36:47.319
MARISHA: Yeah, your head shots fucking MVP, man.

04:36:47.319 --> 04:36:48.617
MATT: -- were MVP on that battle.

04:36:48.617 --> 04:36:50.595
TALIESIN: Thank you. Thank you, thank you.

04:36:50.595 --> 04:36:55.398
MATT: The setup of both slamming it with the
device and getting the device out of the way, the

04:36:55.398 --> 04:36:59.070
surprise entry of this. Because you guys weren't
all ground level, that kept him floating, which

04:36:59.070 --> 04:37:02.515
meant he couldn't keep using the cone of-- there
was a lot of good things you guys used tactically

04:37:02.515 --> 04:37:03.490
for this battle.

04:37:03.490 --> 04:37:04.849
ASHLEY: Vex had a lot of hit points, too.

04:37:04.849 --> 04:37:07.255
LAURA: Oh, Pike, thanks.

04:37:07.255 --> 04:37:08.226
ASHLEY: You did.

04:37:08.226 --> 04:37:11.012
TRAVIS: First kill.

04:37:11.012 --> 04:37:12.424
LAURA: I know, it was my first--

04:37:12.424 --> 04:37:14.342
SAM: Is that true?

04:37:14.342 --> 04:37:17.638
TRAVIS: It, well, here. Since we've started here.

04:37:17.638 --> 04:37:22.196
MATT: That's right, that was your first on the
stream, yeah.

04:37:22.196 --> 04:37:23.092
LAURA: Yeah.

04:37:23.092 --> 04:37:25.168
MATT: Was that your first?

04:37:25.168 --> 04:37:26.614
ORION: Yeah, that was my first.

04:37:26.614 --> 04:37:28.393
MATT: Well, shit.

04:37:28.393 --> 04:37:30.271
ASHLEY: Bunch of firsts, guys.

04:37:30.271 --> 04:37:33.190
MATT: Aww, saved that for the boss fight, too.

04:37:33.190 --> 04:37:34.912
LAURA: So sleepy.

04:37:34.912 --> 04:37:39.009
TRAVIS: Can-- I'm still being grappled by
whatever's in that cage.

04:37:39.009 --> 04:37:40.480
ASHLEY: So we still have a lot to fight.

04:37:40.480 --> 04:37:42.078
LAURA: We still got a lot to do.

04:37:42.078 --> 04:37:43.845
MARISHA: Well, we've got to get the hell out of
here, now.

04:37:43.845 --> 04:37:47.253
TRAVIS: Did you even tell us what's in the cage,
since we never even looked?

04:37:47.253 --> 04:37:49.491
MARISHA: Would you stop that?

04:37:49.491 --> 04:37:52.386
TRAVIS: No, he won't tell me!

04:37:52.386 --> 04:37:55.994
LAURA: Wait, I have a question-- Is the game going
to continue next week,

04:37:55.994 --> 04:37:57.222
or are you guys taking a week--

04:37:57.222 --> 04:37:59.406
MATT: I'm thinking what we're going to do, guys,
for next week, those who are watching, too,

04:37:59.406 --> 04:38:05.045
because we have a few members that are going to be
gone next week on vacation, we're going to-- I'm

04:38:05.045 --> 04:38:09.151
just basically going to be doing a brief
discussion, I'd say a few hours, talking with you

04:38:09.151 --> 04:38:14.049
guys about how to learn the game, how to DM and
build a game, and to answer your questions about

04:38:14.049 --> 04:38:19.744
the system at all, and just do, generally, a
Dungeons &amp; Dragons-specific kind of workshop for

04:38:19.744 --> 04:38:25.818
you guys. And then, the week after that, we'll
pick up where this left off. Oh, I'm exhausted.

04:38:25.818 --> 04:38:28.459
TRAVIS: My ears are like, 102 degrees.

04:38:28.459 --> 04:38:30.837
MARISHA: You're kind of pinky, yeah.

04:38:30.837 --> 04:38:33.907
MATT: All righty.

04:38:33.907 --> 04:38:38.129
ZAC: All right. By the way, do you guys want to
know how many shirts we sold?

04:38:38.129 --> 04:38:39.121
SAM: Sure.

04:38:39.121 --> 04:38:40.643
ZAC: Everything is over.

04:38:40.643 --> 04:38:41.788
MATT: That's right!

04:38:41.788 --> 04:38:42.793
MARISHA: Over.

04:38:42.793 --> 04:38:46.058
ZAC: Yeah, you guys went through it, man. Right
through it.

04:38:46.058 --> 04:38:48.261
MARISHA: I'm sweating.

04:38:48.261 --> 04:38:49.934
MATT: I know, we're all so jittery.

04:38:49.934 --> 04:38:52.018
ZAC: You guys sold 1,304 shirts.

04:38:52.018 --> 04:38:53.920
(cheering)

04:38:53.920 --> 04:38:54.802
TRAVIS: That's amazing.

04:38:54.802 --> 04:39:02.049
ASHLEY: Oh my gosh.

04:39:02.049 --> 04:39:03.654
TRAVIS: I need a drink.

04:39:03.654 --> 04:39:06.341
MARISHA: We didn't TPK.

04:39:06.341 --> 04:39:11.156
TRAVIS: This is where you need a neighborhood bar.
Where we can go and, like-- Go, just, what the

04:39:11.156 --> 04:39:13.232
fuck just happened?

04:39:13.232 --> 04:39:17.134
TALIESIN: I just gained the ability to do those head
shots, like, two games ago, too.

04:39:17.134 --> 04:39:18.463
I'm just so excited.

04:39:18.463 --> 04:39:20.217
ASHLEY: That was amazing.

04:39:20.217 --> 04:39:21.994
MARISHA: That was great.

04:39:21.994 --> 04:39:26.813
MATT: We have Schmoozer, donated $25. "Another 25
to you guys to correct myself for last week. I'm

04:39:26.813 --> 04:39:29.496
"slowly falling more and more in love with you
guys. Since the Overlord says my original message

04:39:29.496 --> 04:39:32.037
"implied I wasn't in love at the start, but I
surely was."

04:39:32.037 --> 04:39:33.463
(laughter)

04:39:33.463 --> 04:39:35.149
ZAC: I was trolling you, dog.

04:39:35.149 --> 04:39:39.504
MATT: Yeah. Tristan Denman donated $40. "Hey
y'all, plan on donating every week from now on.

04:39:39.504 --> 04:39:42.652
"Also got my own Critical Role shirt and hopefully
can snag the How Do You Want To Do This? design I

04:39:42.652 --> 04:39:44.092
"made if it makes it to the store."

04:48:30.120 --> 04:48:31.847
(laughter)

04:48:31.847 --> 04:48:37.702
ZAC: Erika is unfazed by the late night and is
ready to dance. I cannot say the same for myself.

04:48:37.702 --> 04:48:39.122
ERIKA: Any time, any place.

04:48:39.122 --> 04:48:41.804
TALIESIN: Yeah, we also have a couple people in
the studio that should at least say hello before

04:48:41.804 --> 04:48:42.857
they leave, too.

04:48:42.857 --> 04:48:45.870
ZAC: Oh sure, well then they can hop on camera.
We're going to start getting ready for dancing.

04:48:45.870 --> 04:48:47.871
TALIESIN: You gotta say hello.

04:48:47.871 --> 04:48:51.398
MATT: Guess you're still stuck with us. We'll see
you shortly. Thank you for watching.
