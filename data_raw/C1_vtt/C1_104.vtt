00:00:00.152 --> 00:00:01.877
MATT: Welcome back, everybody.

00:00:01.877 --> 00:00:03.104
SAM: Are we in sync?

00:00:03.104 --> 00:00:10.184
MATT: Hopefully. There it is. Okay. Anyway,
welcome back! Thank you again for your patience,

00:00:10.184 --> 00:00:13.998
we're going to kick into this really fast.
However, back to the matter at hand, we are

00:00:13.998 --> 00:00:16.443
sponsored tonight by Marvel Puzzle Quest. Sam,
once again please.

00:00:16.443 --> 00:00:20.011
SAM: Once again, I hope people can hear. Marvel
Puzzle Quest is an awesomely addictive role

00:00:20.011 --> 00:00:24.041
playing puzzle game where Marvel's fearless
superheroes come to life! You can download it now

00:00:24.041 --> 00:00:30.901
on the iTunes, the Google Play, the Amazon App
Store, and the Steam. And now, a rare 5-star

00:00:30.901 --> 00:00:36.752
Spider-man has arrived in Marvel Puzzle Quest just
in time for Spider-man: Homecoming, the movie. You

00:00:36.752 --> 00:00:42.294
can recruit Spidey and play in two new boss
missions featuring the Sinister Six. Face the

00:00:42.294 --> 00:00:48.393
Vulture, or recruit him as a supervillain for your
team. Now, to celebrate the awesomeness that is

00:00:48.393 --> 00:00:52.797
Marvel Puzzle Quest, I have another one of my
famous puzzles for Taliesin.

00:00:52.797 --> 00:00:55.143
TALIESIN: All right! Bring it!

00:00:55.143 --> 00:00:59.656
SAM: Which of the following is an actual enemy
from the game Marvel Puzzle Quest, and which is

00:00:59.656 --> 00:01:03.455
the name of an actual movie starring Jean-Claude
Van Damme.

00:01:03.455 --> 00:01:07.385
TALIESIN: Oh no. I am genuinely in trouble!

00:01:07.385 --> 00:01:08.665
SAM: Hitman!

00:01:08.665 --> 00:01:10.876
TALIESIN: Oh no, that's a DC character.

00:01:10.876 --> 00:01:13.111
SAM: That's an enemy. Brawler!

00:01:13.111 --> 00:01:15.139
TALIESIN: That's a Jean-Claude Van Damme.

00:01:15.139 --> 00:01:17.374
SAM: No. Timecop!

00:01:17.374 --> 00:01:19.245
TALIESIN: &lt;i&gt;That&lt;/i&gt; is a Jean-Claude Van Damme!

00:01:19.245 --> 00:01:21.045
(laughter)

00:01:21.045 --> 00:01:23.081
SAM: Century Fighter!

00:01:23.081 --> 00:01:24.634
TALIESIN: That's--

00:01:24.634 --> 00:01:26.496
MATT: What is it, Taliesin?

00:01:26.496 --> 00:01:29.186
TALIESIN: I don't know! JCVD! This is so painful.

00:01:29.186 --> 00:01:30.521
SAM: Game enemy.

00:01:30.521 --> 00:01:31.941
TALIESIN: Oh my god!

00:01:31.941 --> 00:01:33.238
SAM: Kickboxer!

00:01:33.238 --> 00:01:34.739
TALIESIN: That is a Jean-Claude Van Damme.

00:01:34.739 --> 00:01:35.804
SAM: Bloodsport!

00:01:35.804 --> 00:01:38.393
TALIESIN: Also a Jean-Claude Van Damme! And also,
I think a Marvel villain, as well.

00:01:38.393 --> 00:01:39.924
SAM: Cyborg!

00:01:39.924 --> 00:01:41.240
TALIESIN: That's a DC hero.

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:47.618
SAM: That is also a Jean-Claude Van Damme. I'll
skip a couple of these. Okay. Defender!

00:01:47.618 --> 00:01:49.834
TALIESIN: That is a--

00:01:49.834 --> 00:01:51.473
SAM: Actual enemy from the game.

00:01:51.473 --> 00:01:52.873
TALIESIN: Yeah, Marvel enemy.

00:01:52.873 --> 00:01:57.994
SAM: The Expendables! Double Impact!

00:01:57.994 --> 00:02:00.656
TALIESIN: I'm not even going to-- yeah okay.

00:02:00.656 --> 00:02:02.044
SAM: JCVD!

00:02:02.044 --> 00:02:04.524
(laughter)

00:02:04.524 --> 00:02:06.645
TALIESIN: The only Jean-Claude Van Damme film I've
seen.

00:02:06.645 --> 00:02:12.446
SAM: Okay. And one more for bonus. Killing
Machine. That's a trick; it's a Dolph Lundgren

00:02:12.446 --> 00:02:13.672
movie.

00:02:13.672 --> 00:02:17.416
TALIESIN: I have never been so baffled in my life!
That was amazing!

00:02:17.416 --> 00:02:20.411
SAM: Marvel Puzzle Quest! Marvel Puzzle Quest.

00:02:20.411 --> 00:02:22.865
TALIESIN: Marvel Puzzle Quest.

00:02:22.865 --> 00:02:25.117
LAURA: Go play it!

00:02:25.117 --> 00:02:30.295
MATT: Thank you guys so much. All right so, merch
updates, Laura!

00:02:30.295 --> 00:02:38.674
LAURA: Yes! Okay, you guys. I gots, you know, just
a few, just stuff. So, you know the David Mack

00:02:38.674 --> 00:02:45.105
poster? It looks like some people have requested,
so the poster-- not the signed one! But the

00:02:45.105 --> 00:02:50.238
unsigned one is going to be for sale for a few
days extra, so there's that, that's happening.

00:02:50.238 --> 00:02:51.477
SAM: Hey, that's good news!

00:02:51.477 --> 00:02:56.304
LAURA: That's good news. Also good news is that
some stuff is out of stock in the store, but all

00:02:56.304 --> 00:03:01.397
of it is going to the manufacturers right now, so
things are getting made! So things'll be back in

00:03:01.397 --> 00:03:02.878
stock very soon.

00:03:02.878 --> 00:03:04.856
SAM: Laura, is something wrong with your head?

00:03:04.856 --> 00:03:11.387
LAURA: And! Actually, I think that's about it.
There's still like, the shirts. Some sizes are

00:03:11.387 --> 00:03:15.226
available but some of them are out of stock, and
that's all being reprinted. So you guys, it'll be

00:03:15.226 --> 00:03:20.533
back in the store very soon. Go check out the
store!

00:03:20.533 --> 00:03:23.837
TRAVIS: That was the bubbliest she's ever been
over a three-month span.

00:03:23.837 --> 00:03:26.268
TALIESIN: I'm blaming the shirt, man.

00:03:26.268 --> 00:03:29.560
LAURA: It's the strawberries.

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.226
MATT: Something that they recently announced in
regards to the podcast. Right?

00:03:33.226 --> 00:03:39.703
MARISHA: Oh my gosh, guys! Episodes 11 through 21?

00:03:39.703 --> 00:03:41.076
TRAVIS: 20.

00:03:41.076 --> 00:03:49.244

00:03:54.931 --> 00:03:56.405
SAM: Yay!

00:03:56.405 --> 00:04:02.551
TRAVIS: I listened to it on my ride today. Your
ads are funny. You introduce an ep, I introduce an ep.

00:04:02.551 --> 00:04:04.127
LAURA: Aw, that's exciting.

00:04:04.127 --> 00:04:05.706
TALIESIN: Oh, that's right. I'd forgotten about
that.

00:04:05.706 --> 00:04:08.561
MATT: We have another announcement. Travis, you
want to take this one?

00:04:08.561 --> 00:04:14.796

Foster from Talks Machina will be in there.

00:04:49.278 --> 00:04:51.110
MARISHA: (gasps) Brian Foster!

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:54.714
TRAVIS: We're going to have a whole pre-show

TRAVIS: Oh! That one! 10:00 AM PDT.

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:13.145
SAM: When we're in daylight savings time, it's DT.
PST is when we're not in daylight savings.

00:05:13.145 --> 00:05:14.587
TALIESIN: I just learned that.

00:05:14.587 --> 00:05:19.187
TRAVIS: I just did too, that was great! And a

MATT: All right, awesome! Thank you, Travis! So

LAURA: It's 10:30?

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:54.118
TRAVIS: 10:30 AM.

00:05:54.118 --> 00:05:55.331
LAURA: Sweet.

00:05:55.331 --> 00:05:58.347
TRAVIS: It's at room 3 letters. BCD?

00:05:58.347 --> 00:06:01.771
TALIESIN and MARISHA: PDT (laugh)

00:06:01.771 --> 00:06:07.764
MATT: We put it out on socials, so keep an eye out
for that. We'll have our schedule up here and

00:06:07.764 --> 00:06:13.699
stuff, for Comic-Con available up. So hopefully
we'll see you guys there! Let's see, we have this

00:06:13.699 --> 00:06:15.789
week's Signal Boost went up with our buddy, Mischa
Pollack.

00:06:15.789 --> 00:06:17.278
MARISHA: Oh yeah, Mischa!

00:06:17.278 --> 00:06:20.688
MATT: Been friends with him since high school, and
he's an awesome gentleman. Extremely talented,

00:06:20.688 --> 00:06:25.979
extremely smart man, so check out his episode of
Signal Boost. I like it a lot. Wednesday Club!

00:06:25.979 --> 00:06:27.561
Thank you for having me on last night.

00:06:27.561 --> 00:06:30.175
TALIESIN: Thank you being on our show! It was
fun.

00:06:30.175 --> 00:06:31.510
MATT: New episode next week?

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:34.668
TALIESIN: Yeah, we're going to be doing, in honor
of the new sets that have been happening

00:06:34.668 --> 00:06:37.965
everywhere, we're doing a secret headquarters
where we're going to be talking about famous

00:06:37.965 --> 00:06:42.845
superhero headquarters and everything from like,
old school stuff and the League of Extraordinary

00:06:42.845 --> 00:06:45.521
Gentlemen, to the Titan's tower, all the fun
stuff. It'll be cool.

00:06:45.521 --> 00:06:52.529
MATT: And the new series Dread went up today!
Taliesin and I were players in the awesome Dread

00:06:52.529 --> 00:06:57.151
show that Ivan Van Norman runs. My mic is whack?

00:06:57.151 --> 00:06:58.997
SAM: Yes, your mic is whack.

00:06:58.997 --> 00:07:00.937
MATT: Where'd my mic go?

00:07:00.937 --> 00:07:02.848
TRAVIS: They're working on it.

00:07:02.848 --> 00:07:11.819
MARISHA: You guys can send in Chris to adjust it.
It's okay! They know we're a show with a sound

00:07:11.819 --> 00:07:16.259
guy. There's no real illusion. Sound guy Chris!

00:07:16.259 --> 00:07:22.875
TRAVIS: Chris is a Libra. His interests include
underwater basket weaving.

00:07:22.875 --> 00:07:25.405
LAURA: Yes, long walks on the beach.

00:07:25.405 --> 00:07:31.512
SAM: He has more than one nipple, but less than
five.

00:07:31.512 --> 00:07:34.380
(laughter)

00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:38.470
LIAM: It's an interesting tech night. Ash and I
are Skyping in from the USCSS Nostromo, which is a

00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:44.426
Weyland-Yutani vessel and if we fart out it's
because we've been eaten by xenomorphs. Sorry.

00:07:44.426 --> 00:07:50.918
SAM: Can't hear Ashley at all. Liam is totally
overpowering. I love it

00:07:50.918 --> 00:07:54.241
LIAM: (creepy voice) Samuel.

00:07:54.306 --> 00:07:59.699
MATT: All right guys! Well, that being the case,
let's dive into tonight's episode of Critical

00:07:59.699 --> 00:08:00.834
Role!

00:08:00.834 --> 00:09:33.107
[dramatic music]

00:09:33.107 --> 00:09:38.856
MATT: Hello, everyone, and welcome back.
Hopefully with a fixed microphone?

00:09:38.856 --> 00:09:40.106
SAM: We'll find out!

00:09:40.106 --> 00:09:41.164
CHRIS: We're good!

00:09:41.164 --> 00:09:43.785
MATT: Ah, perfect, awesome! Yeah, I love it! All
right, so to get you guys get caught up to speed

00:09:43.785 --> 00:09:45.955
with what we did in recent episodes.

00:09:45.955 --> 00:09:49.246
(muffled dramatic music)

00:09:49.246 --> 00:09:52.537
SAM: Is that you, Liam?

00:09:52.537 --> 00:10:03.085
MATT: Anyway. Last we left off, Vox Machina had
confronted the Whispered One, the Undying King

00:10:03.085 --> 00:10:14.797
Vecna, in the Shadowfell. The battle did not go in
your favor, with the death and very faint recovery

00:10:14.797 --> 00:10:22.904
of Vex, and the disintegration of Vax during this
confrontation. Realizing that it was not going in

00:10:22.904 --> 00:10:28.077
your favor, you Plane Shifted to the Feywild,
where you began to come up with some sort of plot

00:10:28.077 --> 00:10:32.645
or plan to try and bring your friend, Vax, back
without a body. During this time Vax had a

00:10:32.645 --> 00:10:37.855
conversation with his patron, the Raven Queen, and
was given an offer where he could return along

00:10:37.855 --> 00:10:44.986
with powers that would aid in this coming final
confrontation. However, the deal came with some

00:10:44.986 --> 00:10:50.716
drawbacks, and upon his friends awakening the next
morning in the Feywild, they found Vax returned to

00:10:50.716 --> 00:10:57.976
them, whole. Seemingly alive, returned, though
missing his equipment. Equipment returned, and a

00:10:57.976 --> 00:11:04.214
brief period of figuring out what possibly
delivered their friend back to this space. It was

00:11:04.214 --> 00:11:10.388
decided that based on his experience with his
patron that the powers beyond the Divine

00:11:10.388 --> 00:11:17.631
Gate-- the Prime Gods that lay claim to the divine
beyond the Prime Material plane will probably be

00:11:17.631 --> 00:11:23.160
the next best bet in gaining some sort of power,
information about how to better prepare for the

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:25.728
coming struggle with Vecna, the Whispered One.

00:11:25.728 --> 00:11:30.666
You then made your way to Vasselheim, where Pike
went to her temple of Sarenrae which she had

00:11:30.666 --> 00:11:36.571
helped raise and reconstruct, and had a vision
from her patron deity asking her to come visit her

00:11:36.571 --> 00:11:45.663
at the Island of Renewal, and was granted, through
this vision, an object that would link, via your spell,

00:11:45.663 --> 00:11:52.349
a way to traverse past the Divine Gate and
directly to her location on the plane of Elysium.

00:11:52.349 --> 00:12:00.510
Also, Grog and Scanlan had a little excursion in
the city of Vasselheim and a minor altercation

00:12:00.510 --> 00:12:04.555
with the guards, which led to a larger altercation
with the guards, which led to a much larger

00:12:04.555 --> 00:12:08.257
altercation with the guards, which led to them
barely escaping and deciding it's time to go.

00:12:08.257 --> 00:12:10.270
TRAVIS: We can't go back.

00:12:10.270 --> 00:12:11.971
MARISHA: Vasselheim's most wanted?

00:12:11.971 --> 00:12:20.684
MATT: Yeah. You guys then clasped hands, and using
the Plane Shift spell found yourselves stepping

00:12:20.684 --> 00:12:27.841
down on the crunching sand-like shores of the
Island of Renewal. There looking past the clusters

00:12:27.841 --> 00:12:34.795
of stone and trees that mark the perimeter of this
interesting, beautiful, strange distant landscape.

00:12:34.795 --> 00:12:42.492
You can see beyond the tree line and the hills
that jut up from the floor the crystalline

00:12:42.492 --> 00:12:47.403
structure that seems to mark the center of the
Island, and that is where we left off. What would

00:12:47.403 --> 00:12:49.240
you guys like to do?

00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:53.426
LAURA: Did you say the sand is made of pearls?

00:12:53.426 --> 00:13:00.712
MATT: It appears to be, yeah. The granules of the
sand are too big to be tiny sand granules, they're

00:13:00.712 --> 00:13:07.523
about pearl-size, maybe a little bit smaller. And
they're smooth, and they seem to reflect the light

00:13:07.523 --> 00:13:08.902
in a very beautiful way.

00:13:08.902 --> 00:13:11.242
LAURA: I just want to take a handful and look at
them.

00:13:11.242 --> 00:13:13.986
ASHLEY: Oh, can we make a body scrub?

00:13:13.986 --> 00:13:19.782
LAURA: Good idea, Pike. I'm going to take a good
handful and put it in a pouch and save them.

00:13:19.782 --> 00:13:22.144
SAM: Microdermabrasion.

00:13:22.144 --> 00:13:27.724
LAURA: They're micro-plastic beads that have
washed up on the shore.

00:13:27.724 --> 00:13:32.474
ASHLEY: I'm going to take a little bit, too.

00:13:32.474 --> 00:13:38.232
MATT: Okay, so you gather up some of these
pearlescent beads of some kind and fill a small

00:13:38.232 --> 00:13:43.424
pouch of them and put it amongst the rest of your
belongings. All righty, anything else you guys

00:13:43.424 --> 00:13:46.385
wish to do to prepare? What do you want to do?

00:13:46.385 --> 00:13:48.685
SAM: Oh god. We're going to go see Sarenrae,
right?

00:13:48.685 --> 00:13:52.226
TRAVIS: Yeah, you know, like one does. Fucking
jauntily walk up.

00:13:52.226 --> 00:13:56.468
LIAM: (distorted) And you said that that tower was
full of some sort of flame, right?

00:13:56.468 --> 00:14:00.055
SAM: Sorry, robot Liam!

00:14:00.055 --> 00:14:05.275
MARISHA: No, I wanted two cheeseburgers. What did
you say?

00:14:05.275 --> 00:14:07.217
LIAM: (in speak-and-spell voice) I am richer for
having known you.

00:14:07.217 --> 00:14:09.344
TRAVIS: Thank you! &nbsp;Much better!

00:14:09.344 --> 00:14:10.993
MATT: What did you say?

00:14:10.993 --> 00:14:17.368
LIAM: I said (robot noises). You said that that
tower had, was full of some sort of flame, right?

00:14:17.368 --> 00:14:22.814
MATT: Yes, and the, what little you can see, it
seems to form this torso of a feminine structure,

00:14:22.814 --> 00:14:29.581
the body of which gives out these wings that curl
upward. Held amongst the center of these wings is

00:14:29.581 --> 00:14:36.769
a large, gem-like flame. And you see within the
actual crystalline-- we'll call it like a palace,

00:14:36.769 --> 00:14:41.837
if you will-- it looks like there's a light source
within that flickers and dances like an eternal

00:14:41.837 --> 00:14:45.710
bonfire or flame, and it seems to have a pulse to
it.

00:14:45.710 --> 00:14:52.321
LIAM: I'm sure this is unnecessary, but I'm
going to start thinking about setting the Death

00:14:52.321 --> 00:14:55.018
Walker's Ward to fire damage.

00:14:55.018 --> 00:14:58.355
MATT: Okay, so you guys want to take a short rest
to do so?

00:14:58.355 --> 00:15:00.152
LAURA and SAM: Oh.

00:15:00.152 --> 00:15:01.990
MARISHA: Do we need a short rest?

00:15:01.990 --> 00:15:07.574
LIAM: It's a 20-minute thing. Well, I don't have
to, if everyone else wants to start.

00:15:07.602 --> 00:15:10.263
SAM: We're not in a rush, right? 20 minutes won't
kill us.

00:15:10.263 --> 00:15:12.100
LAURA: I guess. Sure.

00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:17.804
MATT: Okay. So you take the better part of an
hour, half an hour or so, 40 minutes or so, for a

00:15:17.804 --> 00:15:23.608
short rest to reset your armor to fire resist. Any
other preparations?

00:15:23.608 --> 00:15:33.972
SAM: Yeah, well hey. I'm no expert on the
religious arts, but we have this eye of doom with

00:15:33.972 --> 00:15:39.584
us. Should we really be bringing this into a holy
place of goodness?

00:15:39.584 --> 00:15:41.145
LAURA: I don't know.

00:15:41.145 --> 00:15:44.703
TALIESIN: I think, if anything, it might be even
less effective here.

00:15:44.703 --> 00:15:50.596
SAM: But what if it knows where we are and can
somehow get an advantage and kill Sarenrae or

00:15:50.596 --> 00:15:52.020
something? I don't know.

00:15:52.020 --> 00:15:55.443
LAURA: I feel like we should definitely ask
Sarenrae about it. But it's a little late to get

00:15:55.443 --> 00:15:56.900
rid of it now.

00:15:56.900 --> 00:15:59.566
TALIESIN: Other than your pocket dimension.

00:15:59.566 --> 00:16:00.961
MARISHA: It's in the Bag of Holding, right?

00:16:00.961 --> 00:16:01.965
TRAVIS: Nope.

00:16:01.965 --> 00:16:05.536
ASHLEY: I have it. I have the eyeball in the box.

00:16:05.536 --> 00:16:08.135
SAM: Is it still in the box? Can you shake the box
and make sure there's something still in there?

00:16:08.135 --> 00:16:09.364
LAURA: Don't open the box!

00:16:09.364 --> 00:16:11.131
SAM: Don't open the box! Just shake it.

00:16:11.131 --> 00:16:16.183
LAURA: Does it feel like there's an eyeball if you
shake it? Just shake it and feel. Does it shake

00:16:16.183 --> 00:16:17.317
around?

00:16:17.317 --> 00:16:25.659
MATT: (rattling noise) It does rattle a little
bit. Like a peeled wet grape, you hear it sloshing

00:16:25.659 --> 00:16:26.892
around inside.

00:16:26.892 --> 00:16:29.075
ASHLEY: (laughs) Ew.

00:16:29.075 --> 00:16:31.371
TALIESIN: Best Halloween trick ever.

00:16:31.371 --> 00:16:35.738
TRAVIS: Can you crush the tiny granules on the
ground in between your fingers, if you try really

00:16:35.738 --> 00:16:36.780
hard?

00:16:36.780 --> 00:16:37.796
MATT: Do you try?

00:16:37.796 --> 00:16:39.216
TRAVIS: Yeah, I try real hard.

00:16:39.216 --> 00:16:43.859
MATT: Okay, you pick one up, and you (grunts)
push. Make a strength check.

00:16:43.859 --> 00:16:47.316
TRAVIS: 23.

00:16:47.316 --> 00:16:50.445
MATT: (grunts and strains) No.

00:16:50.445 --> 00:16:54.305
LAURA: Whoa! They're titanium pearls!

00:16:54.305 --> 00:16:57.207
MARISHA: It would be good for microdermabrasion!

00:16:57.207 --> 00:16:59.294
LAURA: It really would. Wow.

00:16:59.294 --> 00:17:05.969
ASHLEY: Could I put my hand in the water? Just a
(doot).

00:17:05.969 --> 00:17:11.933
MATT: You step back a bit to where the shore is.
The water is gently brushing against the shore and

00:17:11.933 --> 00:17:16.102
then pulls back. There's no heavy waves. The
current is this steady, almost relaxing,

00:17:16.102 --> 00:17:25.316
undulating sound. This (steady whoosh). You reach
over and place your hand within, and you feel the

00:17:25.316 --> 00:17:32.660
water soak into the inside of the plates of your
gauntlet. It's warm. It's probably the equivalent

00:17:32.660 --> 00:17:39.434
of a good 75, 80 degrees. It would be wonderful
beach water.

00:17:39.434 --> 00:17:49.439
ASHLEY: Okay. Guys, it feels so nice. Should we go
for just a little bit of a swim while he attunes

00:17:49.439 --> 00:17:50.608
to his--

00:17:50.608 --> 00:17:52.117
SAM: Probably, yes.

00:17:52.117 --> 00:17:56.078
MARISHA: I walk over to Pike and put my feet in
the water with her, stand on the edge.

00:17:56.078 --> 00:17:57.380
TRAVIS: Me, too.

00:17:57.380 --> 00:17:58.682
TALIESIN: Oh, also.

00:17:58.682 --> 00:18:01.175
LIAM: I put my cold feet in, since I have no
shoes.

00:18:01.175 --> 00:18:06.369
TALIESIN: Wow!

00:18:06.369 --> 00:18:09.597
LAURA: Shameful.

00:18:09.597 --> 00:18:14.179
TRAVIS: Is there a sun? A point of light in the
sky?

00:18:14.179 --> 00:18:24.725
MATT: The sky is gently dappled with faint wisps
of cloud and is blue and beautiful, but you do not

00:18:24.725 --> 00:18:31.218
see a particular sun in the sky. Though the light
seems to be ever-present, what faint shadows you

00:18:31.218 --> 00:18:35.678
see seem to be almost from multi-directional
light. There is no actual sun in the sky that you

00:18:35.678 --> 00:18:36.687
can see.

00:18:36.687 --> 00:18:41.000
TRAVIS: The light appears ever-present. Strange.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:42.737
LAURA: Wow, Grog.

00:18:42.737 --> 00:18:44.195
TRAVIS: Ow.

00:18:44.195 --> 00:18:51.478
LAURA: I'm going to keep an eye out, see if
there's any movement in the fields while he's

00:18:51.478 --> 00:18:52.960
attuning his armor.

00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:59.578
MATT: Perception check, please.

00:18:59.578 --> 00:19:00.994
LAURA: 24.

00:19:00.994 --> 00:19:06.905
MATT: All right. As you guys sit there waiting on
the edge of the shoreline, keeping a watch across

00:19:06.905 --> 00:19:13.277
the waters and the edges of where the beach begins
to slowly form into the rolling hills and the

00:19:13.277 --> 00:19:20.468
sparse bits of trees that you see marking the
interior of the island, there's no change. It's

00:19:20.468 --> 00:19:25.996
almost like whatever pattern is here is a set
pattern, or at least, any alterations or changes

00:19:25.996 --> 00:19:31.305
would be over a very prolonged period of time. You
see no signs of any other life. You see no signs

00:19:31.305 --> 00:19:34.618
of any other beings walking within your immediate
eyesight.

00:19:34.618 --> 00:19:37.149
LAURA: Does it feel nice?

00:19:37.149 --> 00:19:40.126
MATT: It feels nice. It feels comfortable. It's
welcoming, if a little quiet.

00:19:40.126 --> 00:19:44.678
TRAVIS: When this rest is over, do we know what
direction we're going in?

00:19:44.678 --> 00:19:48.865
LAURA, MARISHA, and TALIESIN: Towards the tower.

00:19:48.865 --> 00:19:52.542
TRAVIS: Jeez, not everybody at fucking once. All
right. Shit.

00:19:52.542 --> 00:19:56.629
MARISHA: Well, you had such good observation
skills with the whole ever-present light thing.

00:19:56.629 --> 00:19:58.588
TRAVIS: What does that mean?

00:19:58.588 --> 00:20:05.825
MARISHA: Man. You're always a surprise. And after
so many years.

00:20:05.825 --> 00:20:07.771
TRAVIS: Thank you.

00:20:07.771 --> 00:20:23.659
MARISHA: I look at Pike. I say, Pike, this place
is beautiful. It's incredible, and I don't think

00:20:23.659 --> 00:20:34.070
we would be here if it wasn't for you and your
connection to Sarenrae. And I'm honored to be here

00:20:34.070 --> 00:20:51.576
with all of you all. And to see this place with
Vax. This makes me happy. Just this moment. This

00:20:51.576 --> 00:20:58.055
is nice. (sighs) I love you all.

00:20:58.055 --> 00:20:59.733
SAM: We love you, too.

00:20:59.733 --> 00:21:01.121
LAURA: We love you too, Keyleth.

00:21:01.121 --> 00:21:03.228
ASHLEY: I love you, Kiki.

00:21:03.228 --> 00:21:04.638
SAM: Just to be clear--

00:21:04.638 --> 00:21:06.122
MARISHA: And I use my inspiring leader feat.

00:21:06.122 --> 00:21:09.100
(laughter)

00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:13.021
SAM: I was just about to ask, was that
well-thought-out speech inspirational?

00:21:13.021 --> 00:21:22.911
MATT: All right, so level 18 that you are, with no
charisma modifier, correct? Everyone gains 18

00:21:22.911 --> 00:21:24.158
temporary hit points.

00:21:24.158 --> 00:21:25.486
TRAVIS: Damn!

00:21:25.486 --> 00:21:28.675
LAURA: Are we all healed up and healthy now?

00:21:28.675 --> 00:21:30.580
MATT: You did take a long rest. Yeah.

00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:32.368
TALIESIN: Oh, we did take a long rest.

00:21:32.368 --> 00:21:38.094
MATT: There were some healing spells spent on
Pike's end and dealing with the eye that was

00:21:38.094 --> 00:21:41.569
recovered, I think. And then you with the Plane
Shift.

00:21:41.569 --> 00:21:43.374
SAM: Me and Grog got shot a few times.

00:21:43.374 --> 00:21:45.179
MATT: Yeah, you got to heal a little bit.

00:21:45.179 --> 00:21:46.801
SAM: But I can use some hit dice.

00:21:46.801 --> 00:21:48.494
MATT: Yes, you can, during the short rest.

00:21:48.494 --> 00:21:54.666
LAURA: These Boots of Haste, I don't have to
attune to them? They're not attunable, right? Or

00:21:54.666 --> 00:21:56.082
do I have to attune to them?

00:21:56.082 --> 00:21:57.812
LIAM: Yes, darling, they are. They're attunable.

00:21:57.812 --> 00:22:03.610
LAURA: Okay, that's fine. Then I'm just going to
unattune my bracers and attune my Boots of Haste

00:22:03.610 --> 00:22:09.829
that I have on. I'm going to spend the next ten
minutes cleaning them up and making them look

00:22:09.829 --> 00:22:11.212
really pretty.

00:22:11.212 --> 00:22:15.126
TALIESIN: You know you're going to get them
back next long rest.

00:22:15.126 --> 00:22:17.243
MATT: All right. So you've attuned to the Boots of
Haste.

00:22:17.243 --> 00:22:18.672
SAM: Yes.

00:22:18.672 --> 00:22:21.603
LAURA: I'm going to get so much shit online.

00:22:21.603 --> 00:22:25.145
MATT: Broomgate 2.0. (laughs)

00:22:25.145 --> 00:22:29.383
LIAM: No. It's exactly what you would do when you
almost lose somebody.

00:22:29.383 --> 00:22:32.817
TRAVIS: (laughs) Keep it coming.

00:22:32.844 --> 00:22:37.802
MARISHA: I'm so proud. He's as cold as his skin is
right now.

00:22:37.802 --> 00:22:39.813
LAURA: Don't die anymore.

00:22:39.813 --> 00:22:43.453
LIAM: It's in character. I mean, don't give her a
hard time.

00:22:43.453 --> 00:22:53.717
MATT: All right, so you guys finish resting. It is
comfortable. It is nice here and especially, in

00:22:53.717 --> 00:23:00.116
the rush of the current state of things, this
brief moment of respite feels so removed from that

00:23:00.116 --> 00:23:05.070
race, that chaos, that ever-present fear and
doubt. And later you know, whether it's the

00:23:05.070 --> 00:23:10.581
surroundings or the general nature of the plane
that you're in, but it's soothing. It's

00:23:10.581 --> 00:23:17.564
comforting. As you finish your attunement to the
item, you finish your new attunement to your

00:23:17.564 --> 00:23:25.698
resistance, you guys gather your things, step out
of the water, put your footwear back on, and what

00:23:25.698 --> 00:23:27.347
would you like to do?

00:23:27.347 --> 00:23:29.393
SAM: Walk towards the busty lady.

00:23:29.393 --> 00:23:31.515
MATT: What's the marching order?

00:23:31.515 --> 00:23:33.618
TALIESIN: Oh, really?

00:23:33.618 --> 00:23:35.694
LAURA: We're going to have to fight things in this
beautiful place?

00:23:35.694 --> 00:23:37.189
ASHLEY: I'll go first.

00:23:37.189 --> 00:23:38.906
TALIESIN: Ash in front.

00:23:38.906 --> 00:23:40.614
MATT: Okay, Ashley's in front. Who's next?

00:23:40.614 --> 00:23:42.311
TRAVIS: I'm with Pike.

00:23:42.311 --> 00:23:44.795
MATT: All right, Grog's right up there with Pike.

00:23:44.795 --> 00:23:46.274
LAURA: I'll be behind Grog.

00:23:46.274 --> 00:23:47.433
TALIESIN: I'll be with you.

00:23:47.433 --> 00:23:48.625
LAURA: Lovely.

00:23:48.625 --> 00:23:51.084
LIAM: I'm going to trail sheepishly behind
Keyleth.

00:23:51.084 --> 00:23:53.728
MARISHA: I was about to say, I don't leave Vax's
side.

00:23:53.728 --> 00:23:54.936
LAURA: Trinket is out.

00:23:54.936 --> 00:23:56.806
MATT: Trinket is out?

00:23:56.806 --> 00:24:04.195
LAURA: And he is walking between-- behind me and
Percy. Yeah.

00:24:04.195 --> 00:24:08.213
SAM: And as always, I'll enjoy the rear.

00:24:08.213 --> 00:24:10.166
TRAVIS: Yeah, you will.

00:24:10.166 --> 00:24:20.024
MATT: Okay, then. All righty, so with Pike leading
on and approaching the pathways that lead towards

00:24:20.024 --> 00:24:27.128
the center of the island, the rolling hills ascend
higher and higher, the further towards where the

00:24:27.128 --> 00:24:34.724
distant crystal monolith resides. Up from the
soft, pearl-like sand to reveal large obelisks of

00:24:34.724 --> 00:24:40.316
carved rectangular stone at off-kilter angles,
jutting out of the ground in places. You had seen

00:24:40.316 --> 00:24:45.747
some of these at a distance when you arrived and
you as well in your vision, Pike, earlier. The

00:24:45.747 --> 00:24:50.752
trees you walk past begin to slowly thin out to
replace some of these stone structures. You can

00:24:50.752 --> 00:24:56.574
see what's almost this outer ring of nature that encloses
the inner portion of this island.

00:24:56.574 --> 00:25:06.778
The wind is now warm against your skin as it
begins to whip through this area and you can hear

00:25:06.778 --> 00:25:14.755
it tear through some of the openings between
these ever densely growing clusters of stonework.

00:25:14.755 --> 00:25:22.335
Occasionally, these stone structures resemble
figures of old ancient figureheads from the Age of

00:25:22.335 --> 00:25:27.315
Arcanum, who bore the embrace of the Everlight
with them before her following fell from grace.

00:25:27.315 --> 00:25:32.083
You can see the ravages of time and the
diminishing of her influence following the

00:25:32.083 --> 00:25:37.725
Divergence are shown on some of these figures as
they appear to be sheared or cracked or broken in

00:25:37.725 --> 00:25:45.427
places. But still, no sign of anything else moving
on the island.

00:25:45.427 --> 00:25:51.906
TALIESIN: Does it look like people are avoiding us
or does it look like this is not a place of--

00:25:51.906 --> 00:25:53.911
MATT: Make a perception check.

00:25:53.911 --> 00:26:01.776
TALIESIN: All right. I had a funny feeling you
would say that. 12.

00:26:01.776 --> 00:26:08.671
MATT: You see no signs of any movement, any foot
tracks. No signs of anything in the vicinity that

00:26:08.671 --> 00:26:12.355
would lead you to believe that you're being
avoided or being watched.

00:26:12.355 --> 00:26:19.924
LIAM: Does it look like anyone has been here for a
very long time?

00:26:19.924 --> 00:26:22.883
MATT: Make an investigation check.

00:26:22.883 --> 00:26:31.352
LIAM: Oh, I'm not going to waste Luck on that.
That's a one. I have no idea what's going in this

00:26:31.352 --> 00:26:32.769
fucking place.

00:26:32.769 --> 00:26:41.007
MATT: Pike, you lead on. You make your way through
these tangled paths and they shift and curve and

00:26:41.007 --> 00:26:46.926
turn and the light never seems to change overhead
and as you hike along and chat amongst yourselves

00:26:46.926 --> 00:26:51.616
and keep open to the vicinity around you and
you're breathing in the clean air with hints of

00:26:51.616 --> 00:26:57.225
seaspray and saltiness that eventually makes its
way through the breeze. You can feel parts of you

00:26:57.225 --> 00:27:02.831
sweat beneath your armor, from the general warmth
of the atmosphere, and you travel for about an

00:27:02.831 --> 00:27:12.738
hour. Pike, and Vex and Vax and Keyleth, you pick
up on this, too. The crystalline structure in the

00:27:12.738 --> 00:27:15.273
center of the island doesn't appear to be any
closer.

00:27:15.273 --> 00:27:16.939
TRAVIS: Shit.

00:27:16.939 --> 00:27:21.482
MARISHA: Didn't we go through something like this
before?

00:27:21.482 --> 00:27:23.553
TALIESIN: We literally went through this before.

00:27:23.553 --> 00:27:26.686
LAURA: We had really think about being there, is
that what we had to do?

00:27:26.686 --> 00:27:32.627
LIAM: Yes. Pike, do you think you need to talk to
her somehow? Or call to her somehow?

00:27:32.627 --> 00:27:40.097
ASHLEY: Yeah. Okay, I'm going to pull out the key
again.

00:27:40.097 --> 00:27:46.063
MATT: Okay. The metallic loop. The curved piece of
metal. Okay.

00:27:46.063 --> 00:27:47.316
ASHLEY: Yeah.

00:27:47.316 --> 00:27:49.921
TRAVIS: (quietly) There is no spoon.

00:27:49.921 --> 00:28:03.242
ASHLEY: Sarenrae, we have
travelled very far and we are here and if you

00:28:03.242 --> 00:28:10.201
could give us any guidance to get closer to you I
would be forever grateful.

00:28:10.201 --> 00:28:12.275
MATT: You say this out loud?

00:28:12.275 --> 00:28:14.202
ASHLEY: Yeah.

00:28:14.202 --> 00:28:22.313
MATT: Okay. You look out before you, still staring
at the crystal structure. No response.

00:28:22.313 --> 00:28:28.501
ASHLEY: Okay, I repeat that again in my head.

00:28:28.501 --> 00:28:32.101
MATT: Okay, so you say it back to yourself in your
head?

00:28:32.101 --> 00:28:33.943
ASHLEY: Yeah.

00:28:33.943 --> 00:28:37.472
TRAVIS: Ticking them off, one at a time. Here we
go.

00:28:37.472 --> 00:28:45.289
MATT: Okay. So you look forward at the crystalline
structure, looking at its form, and focus on those

00:28:45.289 --> 00:28:50.672
words on the inside of your head. No response.

00:28:50.672 --> 00:28:54.741
LAURA: Maybe we have to let her know we're here.

00:28:54.741 --> 00:29:01.272
SAM: Pikey-poo. Pikey-pants. You had a religious
thing and talked to your god, right?

00:29:01.272 --> 00:29:03.215
ASHLEY: Say again?

00:29:03.215 --> 00:29:05.553
SAM: You talked to Sarenrae briefly, right?

00:29:05.553 --> 00:29:07.112
ASHLEY: Yeah.

00:29:07.112 --> 00:29:09.673
SAM: Did she invite you or all of us?

00:29:09.673 --> 00:29:21.644
LAURA: Oh shit. Is this a thing where you think
you're invited to a party, so you bring your whole

00:29:21.644 --> 00:29:24.085
crew and then maybe realize they weren't invited?

00:29:24.085 --> 00:29:30.323
SAM: Do you want to walk solo for ten minutes and
see if you are, solo, getting any closer?

00:29:30.323 --> 00:29:32.832
TALIESIN: We'll keep you in ear contact.

00:29:32.832 --> 00:29:35.662
LIAM: Is this like party hopping at Comic Con?

00:29:35.662 --> 00:29:39.822
LAURA: Yeah. Get us on the list. Once you're in
there, then we'll join you in line.

00:29:39.822 --> 00:29:42.717
TALIESIN: See how many wristbands you can get.

00:29:42.717 --> 00:29:54.260
ASHLEY: Okay. I'll keep walking and I'll keep
looking back, thumbs up, and I'll see what I can

00:29:54.260 --> 00:29:55.813
find.

00:29:55.813 --> 00:30:00.099
MATT: Okay. You walk forward and you can look back
at your friends and you continue to walk forward

00:30:00.099 --> 00:30:07.386
towards the structure. You eventually begin to
weave between these stone obelisks, which get

00:30:07.386 --> 00:30:10.993
dense and overlap to the point where maybe
about a hundred feet ahead, you lose sight of

00:30:10.993 --> 00:30:11.943
Pike.

00:30:11.943 --> 00:30:14.848
LAURA: I want to get on my broom and fly up in the
air and see if I can see her from the air.

00:30:14.848 --> 00:30:20.103
MATT: Okay. You fly up in the air and you look
down and you see her. She's right beyond where you

00:30:20.103 --> 00:30:23.115
lost sight of her originally, and she's walking
forward.

00:30:23.115 --> 00:30:27.928
LAURA: Okay, okay. How you doing, Pike?

00:30:27.928 --> 00:30:35.438
ASHLEY: Good, good. Just traveling over these
stone structures.

00:30:35.438 --> 00:30:44.307
MATT: All right, you watch. Pike, you walk for
another ten minutes or so on your own, and you

00:30:44.307 --> 00:30:51.012
watch her travel, and as you focus, she's
travelling, but she's still the same distance from

00:30:51.012 --> 00:30:56.914
everyone else she was when she left. She went just
beyond eyeline and then it's weird. Like it

00:30:56.914 --> 00:31:01.336
doesn't make sense. You watched her maneuver and
change and shift around things, yet she hasn't

00:31:01.336 --> 00:31:03.190
gotten any further or any closer.

00:31:03.190 --> 00:31:05.332
MARISHA: So is it like a side-scrolling
background?

00:31:05.332 --> 00:31:07.521
MATT: In a way, I guess.

00:31:07.521 --> 00:31:12.644
LAURA: What? And I turn around and the ocean is
still where it was, behind us? Pike.

00:31:12.644 --> 00:31:16.331
ASHLEY: Does it look like I've gotten far? I feel
like I've gone real far.

00:31:16.331 --> 00:31:20.531
LAURA: I don't think you've gone far at all, dear.
I think you're in the same place.

00:31:20.531 --> 00:31:22.839
TALIESIN: I've got a weird theory.

00:31:22.839 --> 00:31:27.271
MARISHA: Is the terrain repeating itself? What was
your theory?

00:31:27.271 --> 00:31:31.501
TALIESIN: Maybe this is vision-based. Maybe we
have to close our eyes.

00:31:31.501 --> 00:31:33.175
LAURA: How did we do this before?

00:31:33.175 --> 00:31:35.343
TRAVIS: I like this. Let's walk with our eyes
closed.

00:31:35.343 --> 00:31:38.183
LAURA: Maybe we just have to think really hard
about being at the tower.

00:31:38.183 --> 00:31:40.916
TRAVIS: I close my eyes and I start walking
straight ahead.

00:31:40.916 --> 00:31:44.482
MATT: (laughs) As Grog closes his eyes and starts
walking.

00:31:44.482 --> 00:31:47.934
LAURA: I close my eyes and think really hard
about being directly in front of the tower.

00:31:47.934 --> 00:31:50.128
MATT: Okay. Anybody else want to do anything?

00:31:50.128 --> 00:31:54.346
MARISHA: I start walking the opposite direction.

00:31:54.346 --> 00:31:56.013
TRAVIS: Eyes closed or open?

00:31:56.013 --> 00:31:58.408
MARISHA: Away from the tower, with my eyes open.

00:31:58.408 --> 00:32:00.377
LIAM: I stand confused and watch Kiki leave us.

00:32:00.377 --> 00:32:02.077
MATT: Okay. Keyleth turns away.

00:32:02.077 --> 00:32:03.906
TALIESIN: I spin three times in a circle.

00:32:03.906 --> 00:32:08.726
MATT: What are you doing, Pike?

00:32:08.726 --> 00:32:14.869
ASHLEY: I'm going to stand there and think about
being closer to the tower with my eyes closed.

00:32:14.869 --> 00:32:20.224
MATT: Okay. You all begin to close your eyes and
begin walking and start wandering in different

00:32:20.224 --> 00:32:22.540
directions and bumping into pieces of stonework.

00:32:22.540 --> 00:32:26.107
SAM: Bunch of cockroaches when you turn on the
light.

00:32:26.107 --> 00:32:36.748
MATT: Pike, you close your eyes for a moment and
concentrate, and your vision is dark. You don't

00:32:36.748 --> 00:32:43.542
see the world around you, but within a few seconds
of embracing this darkness, a sudden burst of

00:32:43.542 --> 00:32:50.748
light appears ahead of you, and you see a burning beacon
visible in the direction where the crystal palace

00:32:50.748 --> 00:32:53.683
was before you.

00:32:53.683 --> 00:32:55.434
SAM: Just Pike?

00:32:55.434 --> 00:32:56.998
MATT: Just Pike.

00:32:56.998 --> 00:33:03.286
ASHLEY: So I'll try keeping my eyes closed and
start walking towards it.

00:33:03.286 --> 00:33:10.715
MATT: Okay. As you guys are figuring yourself out,
and you are concentrating so hard on being

00:33:10.715 --> 00:33:11.845
there--

00:33:11.845 --> 00:33:14.479
MARISHA: I turn around. Is the tower any
closer?

00:33:14.479 --> 00:33:15.388
MATT: Nope.

00:33:15.388 --> 00:33:16.236
MARISHA: Is it further?

00:33:16.236 --> 00:33:17.168
MATT: Yep.

00:33:17.168 --> 00:33:18.934
MARISHA: Shit. I walk back.

00:33:18.934 --> 00:33:21.872
MATT: Okay. You join the rest of the group and you
watch half your party still stumbling into pieces

00:33:21.872 --> 00:33:28.510
of stone. Pike, you with your eyes closed, still
seeing this burning beacon, this circular

00:33:28.510 --> 00:33:36.445
sphere wreathed in flame that just licks up as the
flames slowly burn out of the bottom of this

00:33:36.445 --> 00:33:43.037
structure and flicker off into nothing. You step
for about two minutes or so in its direction, and

00:33:43.037 --> 00:33:50.673
the heat gets warmer and warmer and warmer, and
then you open your eyes for a moment and you're

00:33:50.673 --> 00:33:52.243
right in front of it.

00:33:52.243 --> 00:33:56.529
ASHLEY: Hey, guys, can you see me?

00:33:56.529 --> 00:33:58.279
LAURA and SAM: Can we hear her?

00:33:58.279 --> 00:34:00.188
MATT: You guys can hear her, yeah.

00:34:00.188 --> 00:34:01.972
LAURA: Oh shit. I open my eyes.

00:34:01.972 --> 00:34:05.973
MATT: You look down and she's right in front of
the crystal structure.

00:34:05.973 --> 00:34:09.953
LAURA: She got all the fucking way there? What did
you do, Pike?

00:34:09.953 --> 00:34:14.028
ASHLEY: I just thought about it. I closed my eyes
and I started walking.

00:34:14.028 --> 00:34:15.329
LAURA: That's what I fucking did.

00:34:15.329 --> 00:34:17.088
TRAVIS: Yeah, I did, too. Ow.

00:34:17.088 --> 00:34:19.015
LAURA: Open your eyes, Grog.

00:34:19.015 --> 00:34:22.810
MARISHA: I walked the other way, and it definitely
didn't work.

00:34:22.810 --> 00:34:28.841
SAM: What is she doing that we're not doing? Her
hair is partially blue. Maybe we should dye our

00:34:28.841 --> 00:34:30.690
hair blue, as well.

00:34:30.731 --> 00:34:35.886
ASHLEY: Maybe you can only get here if you're a
believer of Sarenrae.

00:34:35.886 --> 00:34:42.499
SAM: Oh. I'm a believer. Can I try?

00:34:42.499 --> 00:34:44.389
ASHLEY: (singing) I'm a believer.

00:34:44.389 --> 00:34:46.942
SAM: All right.

00:34:46.942 --> 00:34:48.163
MATT: You close your eyes?

00:34:48.163 --> 00:34:53.571
SAM: Yeah. I'm going to clutch my symbol of
Sarenrae and I'm going to close my eyes and I'm

00:34:53.571 --> 00:34:55.719
going to see if anything happens.

00:34:55.719 --> 00:34:59.434
MATT: You sit there in silence for about a minute
and a half as the darkness is there before you,

00:34:59.434 --> 00:35:03.609
pitch black. And you're clutching the symbol as
hard as you can with your fingers, to the point

00:35:03.609 --> 00:35:08.715
where it's almost hurting your hand, and you see
the faintest distant flicker.

00:35:08.715 --> 00:35:12.349
SAM: I'm going to go towards it.

00:35:12.349 --> 00:35:16.748
MATT: You guys watch Scanlan, eyes closed, begin
walking towards the crystalline structure.

00:35:16.748 --> 00:35:19.188
LAURA: It's working for him.

00:35:19.188 --> 00:35:20.511
TALIESIN: I'm going to follow him.

00:35:20.511 --> 00:35:24.339
LAURA: I'm going to try to follow him. I'm not
going to aim for the tower, I'm going to try to

00:35:24.339 --> 00:35:25.778
get to Pike.

00:35:25.778 --> 00:35:28.080
MATT: Okay. So you're going straight for Pike?

00:35:28.080 --> 00:35:28.983
LAURA: Yeah.

00:35:28.983 --> 00:35:31.090
MATT: Okay. And you're following Scanlan?

00:35:31.090 --> 00:35:32.602
TALIESIN: Yeah. Just nonchalantly.

00:35:32.602 --> 00:35:35.249
MATT: Okay. Vax? Keyleth? Grog?

00:35:35.249 --> 00:35:36.989
MARISHA: What do we do?

00:35:36.989 --> 00:35:38.754
TRAVIS: I'm not going anywhere.

00:35:38.754 --> 00:35:40.699
ASHLEY: Come on, Grog.

00:35:40.699 --> 00:35:45.963
TRAVIS: I'm confused. I want to see what happens
to those two when they follow.

00:35:45.963 --> 00:35:48.291
MATT: So what are you guys doing?

00:35:48.291 --> 00:35:50.881
LIAM: How is it working? What are you guys doing?

00:35:50.881 --> 00:35:53.580
MARISHA: They're believers.

00:35:53.580 --> 00:35:56.018
SAM: Maybe you guys have to believe.

00:35:56.018 --> 00:36:02.840
LIAM: Well, I think that the existence of a
pantheon of gods is a well-established fact in our

00:36:02.840 --> 00:36:05.070
world, so I believe.

00:36:05.070 --> 00:36:06.931
SAM: So poetic.

00:36:06.931 --> 00:36:09.766
MARISHA: Do I have to believe deeper than that?

00:36:09.766 --> 00:36:12.033
TALIESIN: I think, perhaps, you need reverence.

00:36:12.033 --> 00:36:15.910
MATT: Scanlan and Percival disappear into the
brush ahead of you guys as you're having this

00:36:15.910 --> 00:36:21.523
conversation. You, rushing towards Pike, as you're
going towards her, you're not getting any closer.

00:36:21.523 --> 00:36:26.388
You can see things rushing past you, but
there's some disconnect, that as soon as you begin

00:36:26.388 --> 00:36:33.968
to change focus, you're right where you were. Grog
and Scanlan. Scanlan, you step forward, and that

00:36:33.968 --> 00:36:38.486
beacon becomes brighter and warmer, and you feel the
warmth and you open your eyes, and you're there

00:36:38.486 --> 00:36:43.186
next to Pike, in front of the palace. And Grog,
you walked alongside Scanlan, and you walked as he

00:36:43.186 --> 00:36:46.845
watched and you went past the brush and suddenly,
you're at the palace.

00:36:46.845 --> 00:36:48.296
TRAVIS: I'm there?!

00:36:48.296 --> 00:36:53.145
MATT: Yeah. Sorry, not Grog. Percy was. You stayed
back. I misremembered.

00:36:53.145 --> 00:36:54.611
LIAM: I grab Keyleth's hands.

00:36:54.611 --> 00:37:01.666
MATT: Percival. That's my fault. So Percival,
you made it past the boundary with Scanlan.

00:37:01.666 --> 00:37:05.703
LAURA: How did you-- how did-- Shit. We should
have followed Pike.

00:37:05.703 --> 00:37:08.063
MARISHA: But Percy, you don't believe in anything.
This is bullshit!

00:37:08.063 --> 00:37:12.024
TALIESIN: I believe in plenty of things. But,
yeah, no, I agree. This is bullshit.

00:37:12.024 --> 00:37:18.529
LAURA: I'm going to close my eyes and be like,
Sarenrae, I really believe in you. You're so holy,

00:37:18.529 --> 00:37:24.502
and very divine and beautiful, and I think you do
really good things for Pike, and I'm very happy

00:37:24.502 --> 00:37:25.870
about that.

00:37:25.870 --> 00:37:30.959
MATT: You concentrate. A minute. Two minutes. Five
minutes.

00:37:30.959 --> 00:37:32.611
LAURA: Fuck. This is not working!

00:37:32.611 --> 00:37:34.976
TALIESIN: Pike. Pike, do you want to collect the
rest of them and lead them back here?

00:37:34.976 --> 00:37:40.313
LIAM: I scoop up Keyleth's hands and I say, you
trust me, right?

00:37:40.313 --> 00:37:42.094
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:37:42.094 --> 00:37:46.131
LIAM: Yeah, yeah, you know that good feeling that
you have when you hang out with Pike? You know

00:37:46.131 --> 00:37:52.192
that warm feeling you have. Toasting marshmallows
with her around the fire, that kind of feeling?

00:37:52.192 --> 00:37:53.715
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:37:53.715 --> 00:38:00.791
LIAM: You know that comes from Sarenrae, so focus
on that with me. And we'll go to Pike. Focus on

00:38:00.791 --> 00:38:03.076
Sarenrae and that marshmallow feeling.

00:38:03.076 --> 00:38:05.994
MARISHA: But that comes from Pike, not from
Sarenrae.

00:38:05.994 --> 00:38:10.642
LIAM: You know that's partially true, but not all
true. Come on, give it a shot.

00:38:10.642 --> 00:38:13.085
MARISHA: Okay. I try really hard.

00:38:13.085 --> 00:38:14.955
MATT: To?

00:38:14.955 --> 00:38:18.935
MARISHA: Think about the marshmallowy goodness
that is Sarenrae.

00:38:18.935 --> 00:38:22.021
MATT: Okay. Vax and Keyleth do this. And then what
do you do?

00:38:22.021 --> 00:38:29.242
LIAM: Close our eyes and show reverence to her.

00:38:29.242 --> 00:38:37.572
MATT: Okay. Another five, six minutes of darkness
passes. Your eyes are closed. No beacon. Nothing.

00:38:37.572 --> 00:38:41.152
ASHLEY: Okay. How long will it take me to walk
back to them?

00:38:41.152 --> 00:38:42.624
MATT: Do you walk back to them?

00:38:42.624 --> 00:38:44.811
ASHLEY: I want to walk back to them.

00:38:44.811 --> 00:38:51.122
MATT: Okay. A minute. You emerge from the brush,
and you walk and see Keyleth and Vax, eyes closed,

00:38:51.122 --> 00:38:55.333
clutching hands, just hoping. And Grog, looking
bored as hell.

00:38:55.333 --> 00:38:58.572
ASHLEY: Okay. Where's Vex?

00:38:58.572 --> 00:39:00.727
LAURA: I'm up here, dear.

00:39:00.727 --> 00:39:10.497
ASHLEY: Okay. Come here. I have an idea. Okay? So
everybody, hold onto me somehow.

00:39:10.497 --> 00:39:13.052
TRAVIS: Hold hands? Like preschool?

00:39:13.052 --> 00:39:14.468
ASHLEY: Yeah.

00:39:14.468 --> 00:39:15.871
LAURA: Like a train?

00:39:15.871 --> 00:39:23.043
ASHLEY: Yeah. Just don't let go. And I'm going to
think real hard, and maybe we'll all be there

00:39:23.043 --> 00:39:23.976
together.

00:39:23.976 --> 00:39:25.023
LAURA and TRAVIS: Okay.

00:39:25.023 --> 00:39:26.313
MARISHA: Okay. We have to walk, though, right?

00:39:26.313 --> 00:39:27.392
TRAVIS: Eyes closed.

00:39:27.392 --> 00:39:30.032
LAURA: All right. I'm not closing my eyes. I'm
just holding onto Pike's hand.

00:39:30.032 --> 00:39:32.143
MARISHA: I'm still thinking about marshmallows,
though.

00:39:32.143 --> 00:39:33.673
TRAVIS: Thinking about bacon.

00:39:33.673 --> 00:39:35.305
LIAM: I grab Pike by the earlobe.

00:39:35.305 --> 00:39:37.821
ASHLEY: That tickles.

00:39:37.821 --> 00:39:43.380
MATT: And Pike, do you close your eyes and follow
that beacon once more?

00:39:43.380 --> 00:39:44.604
ASHLEY: Yes.

00:39:44.604 --> 00:39:51.385
MATT: Okay. As you guys walk alongside, focusing
on Pike and her leading this small pack of friends

00:39:51.385 --> 00:40:00.530
along through the heavily rolling hills and the pieces
of stone obstruction that force you to make your

00:40:00.530 --> 00:40:04.912
way around. You help guide her around these
various obstructions that get in the way. Pike,

00:40:04.912 --> 00:40:09.432
you're concentrating on this burning beacon of
warmth ahead of you. And within three minutes of

00:40:09.432 --> 00:40:16.409
travel, it seemed almost closer than when
you saw her disappear before. You guys look at

00:40:16.409 --> 00:40:21.503
her, and glance up and you've just come across the
threshold of the stones, and you're now in this

00:40:21.503 --> 00:40:25.913
open sandy patch at the base of this large crystal
structure.

00:40:25.913 --> 00:40:28.616
LAURA: Nice! Good job, Pike.

00:40:28.616 --> 00:40:31.869
TRAVIS: Pikey-poo.

00:40:31.869 --> 00:40:34.556
ASHLEY: Look at this.

00:40:34.556 --> 00:40:37.960
MATT: So now standing-- (laughs)

00:40:37.960 --> 00:40:40.011
LAURA: (laughing) It's beautiful.

00:40:40.011 --> 00:40:44.285
ASHLEY: It's so much more beautiful up close.

00:40:44.285 --> 00:40:49.996
MATT: Standing before this magnificent glass-like
structure, you can see the winding shapes and

00:40:49.996 --> 00:40:53.974
edges clearly ascending in the form of a female
torso, rising from beneath the sands to a

00:40:53.974 --> 00:40:59.825
staggering height. Two wings of glittering crystal
curving upward to frame a massive round red gem

00:40:59.825 --> 00:41:06.704
that shines above the head of the woman, with
flames curling from the inside of the facets. This

00:41:06.704 --> 00:41:14.603
red gem would probably be about twice the size of
Grog. It's hard to see the actual height of it

00:41:14.603 --> 00:41:18.054
here, but it's probably close to a hundred feet
tall, the entire structure.

00:41:18.054 --> 00:41:25.381
Now, you see the shifting flicker of the intense
fire that burns within the palace, now, it's

00:41:25.381 --> 00:41:31.223
causing the shadows cast by all nearby things to
dance behind you, and in the inside you can see

00:41:31.223 --> 00:41:39.539
what appears to be a heavy bonfire almost that is
visible beyond a 20-foot domed doorway right

00:41:39.539 --> 00:41:47.848
at the base of the torso. As you begin to approach the
entrance to this crystalline palace-like statue,

00:41:47.848 --> 00:41:53.743
the heat of those flames that you see 
inside, roaring and burning quickly, get hotter

00:41:53.743 --> 00:42:01.822
and hotter on your skin. And as you begin to enter
the interior of this structure, the heat feels

00:42:01.822 --> 00:42:06.787
like it should be getting close to unbearable, but
it never hurts. You acknowledge the temperature

00:42:06.787 --> 00:42:17.084
change, and you're used to knowing this much heat
should hurt, but it never does. It's just hot and

00:42:17.084 --> 00:42:25.989
welcoming. You now stand within the hollow
interior of this incredible wonder, looking at a

00:42:25.989 --> 00:42:30.874
spiraling red tower of orange-red flame that
reaches up about 60 feet or so, in this spiral.

00:42:30.874 --> 00:42:40.184
It's all flame. This large bonfire in the center
of this structure. It flares rhythmically, like a

00:42:40.184 --> 00:42:48.941
very intentional heartbeat. (roaring flames)
Giving these whipping sounds of the heat, and the

00:42:48.941 --> 00:42:53.243
wind and the air that it's tossing upward and out
into the rest of the island around you and you now

00:42:53.243 --> 00:42:57.011
begin to acknowledge the warm winds that were
blowing through the island, all seem to be

00:42:57.011 --> 00:42:59.674
centering and spiraling out from the center of the
island.

00:42:59.674 --> 00:43:06.804
And it's at that point that you see something in
the flame begin to take shape. You watch as this

00:43:06.804 --> 00:43:17.705
dark outline begins to open up as two large wings
unfurl from within, revealing feathers of ivory

00:43:17.705 --> 00:43:25.586
and pearl, like the beach you arrived on, as this
15-foot-tall feminine vision of Sarenrae emerges

00:43:25.586 --> 00:43:33.511
from the roaring pyre, long curling flames burn as
her hair from her beautiful dark skin framing a

00:43:33.511 --> 00:43:39.820
warm and motherly smile, her eyes gold and brown
like the most polished brass. Her robes of light

00:43:39.820 --> 00:43:45.346
blue unfurl in endless strands that almost seem to
tether her to the inferno behind her, and as she

00:43:45.346 --> 00:43:52.773
emerges from the flame, you can't help but find
yourself stunned and awed at the presence. Her

00:43:52.773 --> 00:43:58.959
standing there unsinged from the flames, slowly
descends, still floating above you, her arms out,

00:43:58.959 --> 00:44:05.227
her wings and hair unfurled, almost like a canopy
above the group as you look up at her. Her face

00:44:05.227 --> 00:44:11.463
turns and smiles onto small Pike on the ground,
and you hear her voice for the first time for all

00:44:11.463 --> 00:44:20.703
of you, but not the first for Pike, who has heard
her voice for a very long time. "My Pike, you come

00:44:20.703 --> 00:44:30.120
"to me after all this time. Such a beacon in a very
dark world. Welcome."

00:44:30.120 --> 00:44:47.961
ASHLEY: I take a knee. Thank you for letting us
come here. It's just such an honor to be in your

00:44:47.961 --> 00:45:03.178
presence and to meet you in person. I've been a
believer of yours for my whole life, and to

00:45:03.178 --> 00:45:08.939
actually be here in front of you is very
humbling.

00:45:08.939 --> 00:45:19.273
MATT: She descends faintly. Her massive form
slowly seems to-- not shrink, but shift perspective

00:45:19.273 --> 00:45:28.548
a bit, where once she was this massive entity
before you, seems almost human in size as the hand

00:45:28.548 --> 00:45:35.846
comes down and reaches and touches the top of
Pike's forehead and just runs down the nose, onto

00:45:35.846 --> 00:45:46.028
her chin. And you see the brow furrow a bit as she
says, "You vanished from my sight. You walk paths

00:45:46.028 --> 00:45:54.618
"cast in shadow. My sands whisper thoughts of
sorrow and foreboding. I must know from you all,

00:45:54.618 --> 00:46:00.049
"what dark tidings bring you before me harboring
such emotion?"

00:46:00.049 --> 00:46:18.205
ASHLEY: Well, I think last time we spoke, we took
on a battle that we were not able to complete and

00:46:18.205 --> 00:46:23.140
we need your help.

00:46:23.140 --> 00:46:28.377
MATT: "What type of foe do you face?"

00:46:28.377 --> 00:46:32.392
LAURA: You know Vecna?

00:46:32.392 --> 00:46:43.700
MATT: She looks to you a bit. There's a faint bit
of recognition. "This entity, this Vecna, is

00:46:43.742 --> 00:46:54.761
"clouded, even in history. I know little myself,
and with my sands, they know little of this undying

00:46:54.761 --> 00:46:58.894
"king. I imagine by his own design."

00:46:58.894 --> 00:47:04.047
LAURA: He deals in secrets. It's kind of his
thing.

00:47:04.047 --> 00:47:07.846
MATT: "What can you tell me?"

00:47:07.846 --> 00:47:11.618
TALIESIN: We have a piece of him.

00:47:11.618 --> 00:47:13.597
LAURA: We do.

00:47:13.597 --> 00:47:21.636
SAM: Yes. Maybe. Well, we can tell you that he is
awful, evil, pure evil incarnate, and he wants to

00:47:21.636 --> 00:47:22.973
be a god.

00:47:22.973 --> 00:47:25.406
LIAM: He has eyes on your territory.

00:47:25.406 --> 00:47:34.146
MARISHA: He is something of a demigod now, you
could say, and well on his path to ascension.

00:47:34.146 --> 00:47:35.815
MATT: "Ascension?"

00:47:35.815 --> 00:47:38.587
MARISHA: He wants to be like you.

00:47:38.587 --> 00:47:40.170
MATT: "How?"

00:47:40.170 --> 00:47:45.138
MARISHA: Or I guess he wants to be like the Raven
Queen.

00:47:45.138 --> 00:47:52.979
MATT: You watch the flames grow a little more
cool, a little more of a deeper red in color, and

00:47:52.979 --> 00:47:59.319
the brow furrows more and she pulls back a little
bit from Pike. Not in a retraction, but a worried

00:47:59.319 --> 00:48:06.068
sense that seems to fill the room. The brightness
of the outside sky seems to dim ever so slightly.

00:48:06.068 --> 00:48:12.699
"Ascension? The Raven Queen, you say?"

00:48:12.699 --> 00:48:24.906
MARISHA: He could tell you more, but I know she
was a mortal who rose to her godhood, and I know

00:48:24.906 --> 00:48:27.807
he's looking for a similar path.

00:48:27.807 --> 00:48:30.318
MATT: "Impossible."

00:48:30.318 --> 00:48:32.613
MARISHA: We've seen it.

00:48:32.613 --> 00:48:36.650
LAURA: He's been working on it for a very long
time.

00:48:36.650 --> 00:48:40.228
LIAM: And obviously hungry for power.

00:48:40.228 --> 00:48:48.745
MATT: The wings, still unfurled, the tips seem to
almost curl in a bit as she, as opposed to

00:48:48.745 --> 00:48:55.258
floating above you out and about, is now standing tall
floating above the ground about five or six feet.

00:48:55.258 --> 00:49:00.281
Her vision, her eyes seem to drift from you and
look out past the glass and crystal to the distant

00:49:00.281 --> 00:49:06.900
shores beyond as she speaks out, exclaiming the
thoughts as they come across her mind. Sarenrae

00:49:06.900 --> 00:49:18.749
says, "The Ritual of Seeding is one of the Matron
of Raven's design. It is the secret rite that

00:49:18.749 --> 00:49:24.972
"rebirthed her from her mortal trials and granted
her the powers to take her place among the Prime

00:49:24.972 --> 00:49:34.749
"Gods and become custodian to the realms between
life and death, fate and the cold of winter. But

00:49:34.749 --> 00:49:43.727
"this ritual was summarily cast from all knowledge
and sealed, intent for eternity, by all who walk

00:49:43.727 --> 00:49:51.191
"the paths of divinity. None should know this. None
should know this."

00:49:51.191 --> 00:49:55.670
LAURA: What about the goddess Ioun? The goddess of
knowledge? Would she have known?

00:49:55.670 --> 00:49:59.252
MATT: "She was the one who spearheaded its
destruction."

00:49:59.252 --> 00:50:06.280
LAURA: Vecna's been taking over her chapels?
Temples?

00:50:06.280 --> 00:50:13.299
MATT: "I know not where Ioun is. She is hidden
away. The Dawnfather would know more than I. They

00:50:13.299 --> 00:50:27.121
"were together when she was wounded. If this ritual
has come into the hands of another mortal, where

00:50:27.121 --> 00:50:29.580
"is this mortal now?"

00:50:29.580 --> 00:50:36.988
TALIESIN: We have his eye in a box. It's powerful
and intelligent.

00:50:36.988 --> 00:50:40.060
ASHLEY: I take out the box.

00:50:40.060 --> 00:50:48.411
MARISHA: He's slowly staked out on the Prime
Material plane. Just north of Vasselheim, about

00:50:48.411 --> 00:50:50.056
350 miles.

00:50:50.056 --> 00:50:52.912
LAURA: Recently completed a ritual in the
Shadowfell.

00:50:52.912 --> 00:51:00.621
MATT: "If he's finished the seed, he's already on
his way."

00:51:00.621 --> 00:51:01.982
LAURA: Oh no.

00:51:01.982 --> 00:51:03.974
MARISHA: What does that mean? How can we stop
him?

00:51:03.974 --> 00:51:12.842
MATT: "The ritual takes some time, from what I
recall. I don't know how long. I was not its

00:51:12.842 --> 00:51:21.312
"architect. I was not the one who sealed it. Ioun
would be the one to ask. However, if this is

00:51:21.312 --> 00:51:30.043
"completed, then the Accord of the Divergence is in
danger. If we will have one god on one side of the

00:51:30.043 --> 00:51:44.602
"Divine Gate and the others on the other, we could
not stop him. Understand, in order for any of us

00:51:44.602 --> 00:51:50.079
"to directly interfere to seal a god like we did
once long ago, we would have to tear down the

00:51:50.079 --> 00:51:59.792
"Divine Gate and that would release an entirely new
armageddon upon your world. So either you stop him

00:51:59.792 --> 00:52:05.523
"and seal him, or you live amongst the only god we
cannot stop."

00:52:05.523 --> 00:52:11.103
LAURA: How do we seal away a god?

00:52:11.103 --> 00:52:19.603
MATT: "I don't know. I was betrayed during the
Calamity. I was not present when they began to

00:52:19.603 --> 00:52:25.819
"seal the Betrayer Gods. You'd do best to speak
with maybe some of the others who were more

00:52:25.819 --> 00:52:31.612
"prominent in that time. You walk in Elysium. This
is the realm also of Pelor."

00:52:31.612 --> 00:52:33.664
LAURA: The Dawnfather?

00:52:33.664 --> 00:52:35.172
MATT: "Yes."

00:52:35.172 --> 00:52:39.713
TRAVIS: Might I ask, does Kord reside in Elysium?

00:52:39.713 --> 00:52:48.258
MATT: "No, but you could perhaps speak with him,
too. I don't know much about Kord. We don't see

00:52:48.258 --> 00:52:57.613
"eye to eye." And if you could see a goddess glance
sidelong with embarrassment, this is the closest

00:52:57.613 --> 00:53:06.304
you'd ever see. "I've fallen from import over
recent years, until recently."

00:53:06.304 --> 00:53:08.200
SAM: You?

00:53:08.200 --> 00:53:09.373
TRAVIS: No.

00:53:09.373 --> 00:53:21.337
MATT: She looks down at Pike for a minute. "Until
recently." And turns back to Scanlan and says,

00:53:21.337 --> 00:53:24.174
"And don't think your prayers have gone unheard,
as well."

00:53:24.174 --> 00:53:35.334
SAM: You heard? I'm new at praying. I'm sorry for
all the cursing at first. I had a lot of emotions,

00:53:35.334 --> 00:53:43.291
and I didn't know if anyone was listening.
Apologies, but you heard me at night?

00:53:43.291 --> 00:53:46.879
MATT: "When your heart was true to it, yes."

00:53:46.879 --> 00:53:57.554
SAM: Wow. You won't tell anybody, will you?
Because some of that is personal stuff.

00:53:57.554 --> 00:54:14.349
MATT: She smiles and averts her gaze from you. "Do
you know if this mortal, this man, this Vecna, do

00:54:14.349 --> 00:54:21.525
"you know in your heart of hearts, Pike, that this
man is beyond redemption? Is there any spark of

00:54:21.525 --> 00:54:24.724
"hope in his heart to turn him back to the light?"

00:54:24.724 --> 00:54:40.093
ASHLEY: Well, I would always hope that in
somebody, but at least the time spent with him

00:54:40.093 --> 00:54:47.384
that we have, it doesn't seem that that's his
path.

00:54:47.384 --> 00:54:54.243
MATT: "Well, I trust in your insight, and this is
your judgment to make. The greatest judgment you

00:54:54.243 --> 00:55:03.487
"may ever make. As you walk this path, closer to
conflict with this entity, search yourself for any

00:55:03.487 --> 00:55:10.866
"glimmer, and if there is no redemption to be had,
then smite him with all the might I have granted

00:55:10.866 --> 00:55:11.875
"you."

00:55:11.875 --> 00:55:16.349
ASHLEY: Okay.

00:55:16.349 --> 00:55:22.917
LAURA: He's not doing a lot of talking to us.

00:55:22.917 --> 00:55:26.040
TRAVIS: A lot of killing, disintegrating.

00:55:26.040 --> 00:55:29.841
SAM: How will we know if he's a god or not?

00:55:29.841 --> 00:55:35.111
MATT: "You'll know. We all will know."

00:55:35.111 --> 00:55:38.387
LAURA: So it hasn't happened yet?

00:55:38.387 --> 00:55:39.851
MATT: "Not yet."

00:55:39.851 --> 00:55:41.057
LAURA: Okay.

00:55:41.057 --> 00:55:44.658
MARISHA: How long do these seeding rituals usually
take? How much time do we have?

00:55:44.658 --> 00:55:52.848
MATT: "I don't know. You would have to ask those
who were responsible for sealing it."

00:55:52.848 --> 00:55:54.627
TRAVIS: Dawnfather.

00:55:54.627 --> 00:56:11.208
MARISHA: I'm so confused. That's it? We didn't
walk away from him unscathed the first time, and

00:56:11.208 --> 00:56:13.797
we're just supposed to try again?

00:56:13.797 --> 00:56:21.088
MATT: "Even in the dark days of the Calamity, the
might of our weapons could only diminish the

00:56:21.088 --> 00:56:29.670
"betrayers who rose against creation. The two that
orchestrated our victory and designed the means of

00:56:29.670 --> 00:56:38.888
"sealing away such terrible evil, I've already
mentioned. They would be of more aid than I. The

00:56:38.888 --> 00:56:46.408
"Knowing Mistress Ioun, as wounded and hidden away
as she is, and the Dawnfather, warden to the

00:56:46.408 --> 00:56:56.554
"Chained Oblivion. His fortress across the fields
of Elysium. I could send you there."

00:56:56.554 --> 00:57:00.103
TALIESIN: That would be quite helpful.

00:57:00.103 --> 00:57:01.621
TRAVIS: It was hard getting here.

00:57:01.621 --> 00:57:05.910
LAURA: Will he be as accepting as you?

00:57:05.910 --> 00:57:22.620
MATT: "I don't know. I haven't spoken much with
the others in some time."

00:57:22.620 --> 00:57:28.068
LAURA: You should throw a party. Invite them all.
Get to know them again.

00:57:28.068 --> 00:57:43.971
MATT: She looks down at Pike once more. "My Pike,
you've done more than you know. You've been a

00:57:43.971 --> 00:57:59.518
"guiding light for these wonderful champions and so
many more." She reaches down and lifts you off the

00:57:59.518 --> 00:58:05.140
ground a bit, looking at your face, the bit of
sadness that creeps across it as she lifts you up

00:58:05.140 --> 00:58:14.520
and you guys watch as she glides, passing through
the crystal, Pike being brought below the archway

00:58:14.520 --> 00:58:27.000
as she just lifts her out beyond this crystal
structure. She ascends upward about 25, 30 feet or

00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:32.587
so, holding Pike in her hands out in front of her.

00:58:32.587 --> 00:58:34.323
And just chucks her.

00:58:34.323 --> 00:58:35.858
(laughter)

00:58:35.858 --> 00:58:47.070
MATT: No. Holding her close-- and by this point,
Sarenrae's form has expanded to almost the size of

00:58:47.070 --> 00:58:52.305
the crystal structure you came to. You can now see
a parallel between her wings and her form and her

00:58:52.305 --> 00:59:01.744
torso as to the actual incredible presence of this
god before you. And leans in, as she shows the

00:59:01.744 --> 00:59:10.451
island to Pike below and whispers close to your
ear, "I'm not lonely here, Pike, for my sands

00:59:10.451 --> 00:59:21.963
"remain with me, speak with me, and we learn from
each other. Look." As she extends her arm, Pike,

00:59:21.963 --> 00:59:30.692
you look out, and all of the light of the sky
seems to shine at once through every pearl, every

00:59:30.692 --> 00:59:35.740
grain of the beach sand that you've walked across.
And where once you saw what was just a barren

00:59:35.740 --> 00:59:46.591
landscape, you now see thousands and thousands and
thousands of people. Opaque. Translucent. Souls of

00:59:46.591 --> 00:59:53.970
those that have come to Sarenrae since the dawn of
creation. Those who swore themselves to good under

00:59:53.970 --> 01:00:00.610
her banner and at the end of their lives came to
become part of the Island of Renewal and forever

01:00:00.610 --> 01:00:05.514
live with her and amongst the rest of the
community of people that are warmed under her

01:00:05.514 --> 01:00:15.080
light. They all seem to look up at once at you,
and you sense them smiling, as the vision fades

01:00:15.080 --> 01:00:18.118
and the island goes back untouched.

01:00:18.118 --> 01:00:31.700
She drifts back down and places you on the ground.
"You see, one day, you will join us, too. And we

01:00:31.807 --> 01:00:41.773
"will all have so many stories to share." You now
see her hovering over all of you as you step out

01:00:41.773 --> 01:00:53.010
of this to join Pike on the exterior of this
tower. "While I am diminished, my powers limited,

01:00:53.010 --> 01:01:04.242
"you do possibly face something terrible, unseen
since the Calamity. And for this journey, Pike, I

01:01:04.242 --> 01:01:07.820
"grant you my blessing."

01:01:07.820 --> 01:01:14.452
And as she reaches her hands out and they expand,
her head lifts up, her eyes close, and her wings

01:01:14.452 --> 01:01:22.739
flare into a phoenix-like flame that just
emblazons the sky with light and fire. The heat is

01:01:22.739 --> 01:01:27.779
more intense than anything you've felt, yet still
there's no pain. It's just all-consuming. It's

01:01:27.779 --> 01:01:35.298
like the rebirth of a phoenix and you're all
surrounded by it. For a moment, it's all there is

01:01:35.298 --> 01:01:45.254
in existence, just this incredible entity. And then
the flames slowly die away, except for the flames

01:01:45.254 --> 01:01:53.972
that currently engulf Pike's gnome form. And as
the flames burn away, you can see on Pike the

01:01:53.972 --> 01:02:07.684
familiar set of wings you've seen her spiritual
form hold, which fold in and then dissipate. You

01:02:07.684 --> 01:02:09.360
now have the Blessing of the Everlight.

01:02:09.360 --> 01:02:12.483
(cheering)

01:02:12.483 --> 01:02:15.544
ASHLEY: Oh my goodness! What is that?

01:02:15.544 --> 01:02:19.911
MATT: You get a plus-two bonus to your
constitution.

01:02:19.911 --> 01:02:21.255
ASHLEY: Okay.

01:02:21.255 --> 01:02:23.514
TRAVIS: We'll take a picture and text it to you.

01:02:23.514 --> 01:02:25.122
ASHLEY: Okay.

01:02:25.122 --> 01:02:32.914
MATT: As a bonus action, you can summon the wings
of the Everlight, granting you a flying speed of

01:02:32.914 --> 01:02:39.953
40 feet for up to ten minutes. And while you have
these wings, any spells you cast that cause

01:02:39.953 --> 01:02:43.114
creatures to regain hit points heal an additional
ten hit points.

01:02:43.114 --> 01:02:46.004
(cheering)

01:02:46.004 --> 01:02:48.741
MATT: But once this ability is used, you can't use
it for another seven days.

01:02:48.741 --> 01:02:50.448
ALL: Oh.

01:02:50.448 --> 01:02:53.745
ASHLEY: Man, I love her so much.

01:02:53.745 --> 01:02:58.236
MATT: So if you want to take a picture and send
that to her. Here we go. Hold onto that and give

01:02:58.236 --> 01:02:59.703
it to her.

01:02:59.703 --> 01:03:01.279
MARISHA: Is Sarenrae gone?

01:03:01.279 --> 01:03:04.377
MATT: No. Sarenrae is still there, just the flames
have burned away.

01:03:04.377 --> 01:03:06.428
LAURA: I'm going to send this to you, Ashley.

01:03:06.428 --> 01:03:09.644
TALIESIN: I'm right here, guys. It's really not
cool.

01:03:09.644 --> 01:03:11.935
ASHLEY: Oh man!

01:03:11.935 --> 01:03:25.565
LAURA: Since Sarenrae is still standing there, I
want to say to her-- shit.

01:03:25.565 --> 01:03:28.194
TRAVIS: Good start.

01:03:28.194 --> 01:03:42.454
LAURA: Shit, sorry. I want to apologize. This
feels so stupid. I want to apologize for never

01:03:42.454 --> 01:03:58.085
realizing what you are and what this could be and
for not showing you the reverence that you

01:03:58.085 --> 01:04:10.848
deserve. And I hope to change that in the future,
and I will certainly think differently from here

01:04:10.848 --> 01:04:12.125
on out.

01:04:12.125 --> 01:04:16.885
MATT: As you look down and look up, where once she
was this large entity above you, you look down and

01:04:16.885 --> 01:04:29.416
look up, and she's right before you. "No apologies
necessary. The creation of Exandria, the peoples

01:04:29.416 --> 01:04:40.981
"that populate it and develop and design, innovate
and worship, was with free will to make your own

01:04:40.981 --> 01:04:51.767
"path. Faith is important to some, but the intent
was to instill you with the means of doing and

01:04:51.767 --> 01:05:01.376
"choosing whatever and however you like. We do not
wish reverence of all. Just those who find us. At

01:05:01.405 --> 01:05:04.768
"least, I speak for myself."

01:05:04.768 --> 01:05:10.005
LAURA: Well, I think you're pretty wonderful.

01:05:10.005 --> 01:05:12.034
MATT: "There is balance to everything."

01:05:12.034 --> 01:05:19.482
LAURA: And I took these from your beach. It
doesn't seem right.

01:05:19.482 --> 01:05:26.919
MATT: She takes the pouch from you and pours it
out, and as the pearls are about to land, they

01:05:26.919 --> 01:05:31.466
drift off and dart off back to the location where
you originally found them.

01:05:31.466 --> 01:05:44.335
ASHLEY: Same. I just thought I wanted to take a
little piece with me, but I already have that. I

01:05:44.335 --> 01:05:46.769
didn't know what it was.

01:05:46.769 --> 01:05:50.020
MATT: As you empty the pearls, they also dart off
towards the beach where you first landed.

01:05:50.020 --> 01:05:53.984
LAURA: I just thought they were really pretty.

01:05:53.984 --> 01:05:58.398
ASHLEY: I would have told you before we left, you
know.

01:05:58.398 --> 01:06:08.650
MATT: "It's all right. But for everything great
that we may have created, you continue to create

01:06:08.650 --> 01:06:21.847
"far better. Our existence brings threat. We've
brought two calamities before. We try and avoid a

01:06:21.847 --> 01:06:30.604
"third. Whether we diminish in time or just
maintain this balance, it's you, and your

01:06:30.604 --> 01:06:36.149
"children, and your children's children, that hold
the keys to the future of your lives, your people,

01:06:36.149 --> 01:06:43.693
"your culture, and us. So don't apologize."

01:06:43.693 --> 01:06:50.809
TRAVIS: Would you say Sarenrae's attractive?

01:06:50.809 --> 01:06:56.669
MATT: Are you asking her, or is this a question to
me as the DM?

01:06:56.669 --> 01:06:58.445
TRAVIS: Yeah, that one.

01:06:58.445 --> 01:07:03.360
MATT: She's beautiful. I wouldn't put it in terms
of any sort of a sexual object.

01:07:03.360 --> 01:07:05.318
TRAVIS: She's just beautiful.

01:07:05.318 --> 01:07:10.709
MATT: She's just an incredibly beautiful,
powerful, feminine form. And, to the extent where

01:07:10.709 --> 01:07:17.079
Grog, who usually being a man who's driven by base
needs, not a single thought comes across you in

01:07:17.079 --> 01:07:21.878
any base or defacing way, it is too powerful. It
overwhelms it.

01:07:21.878 --> 01:07:24.117
TRAVIS: Yeah, no, she's beautiful.

01:07:24.117 --> 01:07:26.990
MARISHA: What are titties?

01:07:26.990 --> 01:07:30.349
LAURA: What even are titties?

01:07:30.349 --> 01:07:33.828
MARISHA: What do titties?

01:07:33.828 --> 01:07:39.486
TRAVIS: I'm keeping my little pearl from the
beach.

01:07:39.486 --> 01:07:44.012
MARISHA: (laughs) That you've been trying to
crush?

01:07:44.012 --> 01:07:45.871
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:07:45.871 --> 01:07:51.625
LAURA: Terrible. Matt's like, shady shit.

01:07:51.625 --> 01:07:54.836
TRAVIS: We're going to need one, y'all gave yours
back.

01:07:54.836 --> 01:07:57.649
TALIESIN: It's going to be like the Wonka factory,
it's just it's going to turn on you.

01:07:57.649 --> 01:08:01.086
MATT: You stole fizzy lifting drinks. You now have
to be watched.

01:08:01.086 --> 01:08:05.830
TALIESIN: Pearls from the beach, you get nothing,
sir! Good day!

01:08:05.830 --> 01:08:07.509
MATT: (laughing) Good day, sir!

01:08:07.509 --> 01:08:09.218
TRAVIS: It's just one!

01:08:09.218 --> 01:08:21.670
MATT: I know. "You have my blessing, Pike. Do this
for me, do this for them, do this for you. Do this

01:08:21.670 --> 01:08:39.220
"for all of creation. And do it soon. The longer
you wait, well, the longer you wait. Do you wish

01:08:39.220 --> 01:08:41.849
"to be off to the Dawnfather?"

01:08:41.849 --> 01:08:45.920
SAM: Yes, time is of the essence. We should go
right away.

01:08:45.920 --> 01:08:52.150
MARISHA: Is he as warm and welcoming and nice as
you are?

01:08:52.150 --> 01:08:54.243
MATT: (laughs)

01:08:54.243 --> 01:08:56.179
MARISHA: Okay, that's a good answer.

01:08:56.179 --> 01:09:01.615
MATT: With a bright white flash emanating from her
torso and arms, your vision just goes white and

01:09:01.615 --> 01:09:09.231
you all blink for a moment as your head spins for
but a brief instant. Your feet touch hard ground

01:09:09.231 --> 01:09:16.214
and you all immediately reach up and rub your
eyes, and as your vision slowly coalesces once

01:09:16.214 --> 01:09:26.416
more, you find yourself standing in the deep
center of some vast orchard, surrounded by an

01:09:26.416 --> 01:09:33.242
endless sea of fruit-bearing trees of all sizes,
shapes and colors, intertwined, the canopy broken

01:09:33.242 --> 01:09:43.311
and sparse in places where you can see above a
clear, blue, cloudless sky. You're no longer on

01:09:43.311 --> 01:09:46.991
the Island of Renewal, that's for sure.

01:09:46.991 --> 01:09:50.003
LAURA: Oh, I thought, but isn't that where the
Dawnfather is?

01:09:50.003 --> 01:09:58.479
MATT: Island of Renewal is where Sarenrae is. The
blessed fields of Elysium is the plane. He existed

01:09:58.479 --> 01:09:59.811
elsewhere in there.

01:09:59.811 --> 01:10:01.634
LAURA: I understand now.

01:10:01.634 --> 01:10:06.181
MARISHA: Is there the same ever-light sky?

01:10:06.181 --> 01:10:08.279
MATT: Make a nature check.

01:10:08.279 --> 01:10:17.772
MARISHA: Ever-present, sorry. Ever-presence in
light. I use my druidic die. 29. Sorry, 31.

01:10:17.772 --> 01:10:23.118
MATT: It's hard to see from down low, because the
canopy does choke it a bit, you can see bits of

01:10:23.118 --> 01:10:28.510
the sky that appear blue, cloudless, whereas you
saw wisps of cloud over the island, this appears

01:10:28.510 --> 01:10:31.901
clear, you can climb up a bit and try to get a
better look if you want.

01:10:31.901 --> 01:10:33.222
MARISHA: Sure.

01:10:33.222 --> 01:10:37.921
MATT: Okay, so you begin to leap up through the
branches, and a lot of the trees here have winding

01:10:37.921 --> 01:10:42.364
and knotted branches, so it's pretty easy to find
your way up the canopy after maybe a five minute

01:10:42.364 --> 01:10:49.012
climb. You get up and peek over and you can see
now this orchard goes on for miles and miles, and

01:10:49.012 --> 01:10:54.841
miles, filling this vast valley that you can
barely see mountains that crest the edge of it in

01:10:54.841 --> 01:11:01.189
the distance near the horizon. You also see there
is no cloud in the sky, and there is no sun, but

01:11:01.189 --> 01:11:10.632
there is a single pillar of light that streaks
down from way way up, the zenith striking down in

01:11:10.632 --> 01:11:16.678
the center of this orchard, where there you see
before you this awe-inspiring sight of the

01:11:16.678 --> 01:11:25.482
Dawnfather's home: a gold-plated citadel of many
humongous towers and spires that both resembles a

01:11:25.482 --> 01:11:33.427
military fortress and the largest-steepled church
you've ever seen. It's hard to gauge distance with

01:11:33.427 --> 01:11:38.046
so many trees between you and it, you don't know
if it's miles off from you, if it's maybe a

01:11:38.046 --> 01:11:43.022
thousand feet or so, but even at this distance,
it's incredible in its scale.

01:11:43.022 --> 01:11:48.273
MARISHA: Oh. Hey, guys, Pelor's not messing
around.

01:11:48.273 --> 01:11:52.611
TRAVIS: They make really tall things here.

01:11:52.611 --> 01:12:03.816
LAURA: I fly up next to Keyleth so I can see. Wow.
Do you think this is like Sarenrae, where we can't

01:12:03.816 --> 01:12:08.313
get to him unless we have him in our heart?

01:12:08.313 --> 01:12:19.366
MARISHA: You know, I feel a little bit more
connected here. This I can-- it's trees. I'm

01:12:19.366 --> 01:12:22.534
surrounded by trees. This I can relate to.

01:12:22.534 --> 01:12:26.034
LAURA: I mean, I've tried to talk to Pelor
before.

01:12:26.034 --> 01:12:30.223
MARISHA: I've talked to the Sun Tree. (gasps) I
wonder if the Sun Tree is here? Maybe he's got a

01:12:30.223 --> 01:12:32.172
twin here like you have a twin!

01:12:32.172 --> 01:12:34.210
LAURA: Maybe.

01:12:34.210 --> 01:12:41.084
TALIESIN: Do I recognize any of the fruit that's
growing on the trees?

01:12:41.084 --> 01:12:43.464
MATT: Make a nature check.

01:12:43.464 --> 01:12:46.613
TALIESIN: Yeah. 15.

01:12:46.613 --> 01:12:48.343
MARISHA: Decent for a city boy.

01:12:48.343 --> 01:12:58.647
MATT: It's interesting. This orchard-- various
fruits thrive in various climates. As you begin to

01:12:58.647 --> 01:13:05.153
walk a little bit through, it is a peppering of
all sorts of trees and fruits. You see apples of

01:13:05.153 --> 01:13:12.023
all shades, you see oranges, you see rare passion
fruits, you see floral-based growing fruit. It's a

01:13:12.023 --> 01:13:15.511
perpetual harvest here.

01:13:15.511 --> 01:13:18.615
LAURA: I rush down and say, don't eat the fruit!

01:13:18.615 --> 01:13:19.915
SAM: Might be souls?

01:13:19.915 --> 01:13:21.618
LAURA: I think it might be souls!

01:13:21.618 --> 01:13:25.672
TRAVIS: No, it's fruit! Souls don't grow on
trees.

01:13:25.672 --> 01:13:29.355
MARISHA: Souls also don't wash up on beaches, but
apparently they do.

01:13:29.355 --> 01:13:33.208
TALIESIN: That may be the most interesting thing I
think you've ever said, is souls don't grow on

01:13:33.208 --> 01:13:34.314
trees.

01:13:34.314 --> 01:13:36.586
MARISHA and TALIESIN: Souls don't grow on trees!

01:13:36.586 --> 01:13:39.783
MARISHA: At least he knows the dangers of
monocultures. This is very impressive.

01:13:39.783 --> 01:13:42.213
TALIESIN: Yeah, this is, there's a lot of
variety.

01:13:42.213 --> 01:13:43.734
TRAVIS: What?

01:13:43.734 --> 01:13:48.484
MATT: What're you guys doing?

01:13:48.484 --> 01:13:52.514
LIAM: Vax is off on his own, by the way, sitting
on his ass having a moment, because it wasn't too

01:13:52.514 --> 01:13:57.247
long ago when he had a thing for Sarenrae, and
that was pretty bittersweet so he's staring off

01:13:57.247 --> 01:13:58.613
into space.

01:13:58.613 --> 01:14:00.517
MATT: Okay.

01:14:00.517 --> 01:14:07.254
TRAVIS: One piece of fruit? One piece, just one
little piece. An apple.

01:14:07.254 --> 01:14:09.443
SAM: No.

01:14:09.443 --> 01:14:12.228
TRAVIS: We're in Elysium! Oh my god, please.

01:14:12.228 --> 01:14:15.773
TALIESIN: If you do eat anything, and you
shouldn't, but if you do eat anything, eat

01:14:15.773 --> 01:14:17.974
something you don't recognize, it'll be funnier
that way.

01:14:17.974 --> 01:14:20.185
TRAVIS: Is there any fruit that I don't
recognize?

01:14:20.185 --> 01:14:21.815
MATT: Make an investigation check.

01:14:21.815 --> 01:14:23.374
TALIESIN: (deadpan) No, don't, stop.

01:14:23.374 --> 01:14:28.045
TRAVIS: Something I don't recognize. 12.

01:14:28.064 --> 01:14:33.505
MATT: Yeah, actually, you guys walk for about
three or four minutes in the direction of where

01:14:33.505 --> 01:14:37.324
you saw the fortress, and you come across what
looks to be a small bush that's clustered near

01:14:37.324 --> 01:14:43.992
this dark wooden tree with a thick, gnarled
exterior, and this bush has these small ripe

01:14:43.992 --> 01:14:47.081
plum-like fruits that come to a point at the
bottom that you've never seen before.

01:14:47.081 --> 01:14:49.061
LAURA: Grog, do not. Do not.

01:14:49.061 --> 01:14:51.050
TRAVIS: What? Pick this?

01:14:51.050 --> 01:14:52.101
LAURA: Don't! (gasps)

01:14:52.101 --> 01:14:53.268
MARISHA: (gasps) Grog!

01:14:53.268 --> 01:14:54.650
TALIESIN: I dare you not to eat it.

01:14:54.650 --> 01:14:57.841
MARISHA: Don't say that. He'll do it! You know
that's what happens!

01:14:57.841 --> 01:15:00.090
TRAVIS: No, why don't we say, are you a person?

01:15:00.090 --> 01:15:02.975
TALIESIN: (whispers) Grog.

01:15:02.975 --> 01:15:05.616
TRAVIS: Nothing? Nothing. You want to check it for
magic?

01:15:05.616 --> 01:15:10.778
LAURA: Yeah, I'm going to check it. Hello, are you
a soul?

01:15:10.778 --> 01:15:12.583
MARISHA: Yes, I'm a soul.

01:15:12.583 --> 01:15:16.426
LAURA: (gasps) Oh my god, it is a soul! It just
spoke to me. Oh my god. What's your favourite

01:15:16.426 --> 01:15:17.304
color?

01:15:17.304 --> 01:15:18.639
MARISHA: Blue, like your feather.

01:15:18.639 --> 01:15:28.945
LAURA: It said blue, like my feather! Did you hear
it? It was talking, Grog. It was talking.

01:15:28.945 --> 01:15:31.311
TRAVIS: Hey, Pike?

01:15:31.311 --> 01:15:33.553
ASHLEY: Don't eat it.

01:15:33.553 --> 01:15:34.426
TRAVIS: What?!

01:15:34.426 --> 01:15:37.604
(laughter)

01:15:37.604 --> 01:15:39.074
ASHLEY: Just in case!

01:15:39.074 --> 01:15:41.970
TRAVIS: What do I do with it? I already picked
it!

01:15:41.970 --> 01:15:48.544
ASHLEY: I have an idea! Why don't you hold onto
it. Keep it in your pouch.

01:15:48.544 --> 01:15:52.533
LAURA: Not in the Bag of Holding, keep it in your
shirt pocket.

01:15:52.533 --> 01:15:56.564
TRAVIS: When have I ever worn a shirt?

01:15:56.564 --> 01:16:03.292
ASHLEY: You can ask him if the fruit is edible,
and make sure it's not people.

01:16:03.292 --> 01:16:10.878
TRAVIS: That's fair. All right. I will hold onto
the pointy plum.

01:16:10.878 --> 01:16:12.894
MATT: (laughs) Okay.

01:16:12.894 --> 01:16:14.946
LAURA: Are we getting any closer to the citadel?

01:16:14.946 --> 01:16:16.485
MATT: You guys keep walking towards it?

01:16:16.485 --> 01:16:17.884
LAURA, MARISHA, and TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:16:17.884 --> 01:16:19.692
MATT: All right, you walk on.

01:16:19.692 --> 01:16:23.374
LAURA: Are there any people? Does it look like
there's tracks in this orchard?

01:16:23.374 --> 01:16:33.169
MATT: Actually, Vax, Vex, and Keyleth, you notice
fairly quickly in that you begin to see movement

01:16:33.169 --> 01:16:39.947
ahead. The air itself, which by the way, the wind
here is carrying a very sweet and fragrant, almost

01:16:39.947 --> 01:16:45.654
like honey flower whiffs that come through in
waves that hit you, the whole atmosphere here

01:16:45.654 --> 01:16:53.380
makes you hungry, it makes you comfortable, it
reminds you of childhood in a strange way. It's a

01:16:53.380 --> 01:17:02.204
very good, positive atmosphere. You begin to see
as you approach, figures, moving. Pike, you

01:17:02.204 --> 01:17:06.787
recognize this because these are similar to the
vision you just had from Sarenrae. They are

01:17:06.787 --> 01:17:16.854
entities. They are souls. They are people that
walk the fields of Elysium, and you see them walk

01:17:16.854 --> 01:17:24.785
with small satchels, and you see them picking the
fruit. And gathering, and harvesting. They don't

01:17:24.785 --> 01:17:29.688
seem to pay you too much mind, and as you begin to
get close to some of them, they just stop and

01:17:29.688 --> 01:17:35.925
watch you. It's very Spirited Away, in a strange
way. You see these somewhat translucent entities

01:17:35.925 --> 01:17:39.957
that barely acknowledge your existence and then as
you pass by, they go on to whatever work they were

01:17:39.957 --> 01:17:44.698
doing. No speech, you don't even see eyes or
faces, you just see the outline of the human-like

01:17:44.698 --> 01:17:46.787
shape, various heights and sizes.

01:17:46.787 --> 01:17:48.756
LAURA: But they're picking the solid fruit?

01:17:48.756 --> 01:17:50.378
MATT: They're picking the solid fruit, and
gathering them.

01:17:50.378 --> 01:17:51.749
TALIESIN: Are they eating the solid fruit?

01:17:51.749 --> 01:17:53.344
MATT: You don't see any of them immediately eating
it.

01:17:53.344 --> 01:17:55.086
TALIESIN: None of them are eating the fruit.

01:17:55.086 --> 01:17:56.693
MARISHA: I have a feeling it's an offering.

01:17:56.693 --> 01:18:00.220
TRAVIS: I have a feeling it's fucking fruit.

01:18:00.220 --> 01:18:05.679
MARISHA: Are we getting closer?

01:18:05.679 --> 01:18:11.559
MATT: You continue to walk and make sure to avoid
some of the larger clusters of these various

01:18:11.559 --> 01:18:18.991
harvesting entities, these harvest souls. You,
who's leading the charge this time, who's leading

01:18:18.991 --> 01:18:21.131
you through the orchards?

01:18:21.131 --> 01:18:25.278
TALIESIN: One of you two. Is this technically
favored terrain for you?

01:18:25.278 --> 01:18:27.507
MATT: It would count as a forest for you.

01:18:27.507 --> 01:18:34.485
LAURA: Yeah? I guess I'll be in the front. Percy,
have you done a lot of talking to Pelor?

01:18:34.485 --> 01:18:37.189
TALIESIN: Not really, no.

01:18:37.189 --> 01:18:42.525
MARISHA: Percy, how do you feel about gods these
days? Last time we talked we were both not

01:18:42.525 --> 01:18:44.360
optimistic, I feel like.

01:18:44.360 --> 01:18:51.705
TALIESIN: I know how to be polite. I'm very
reasonable at that.

01:18:51.705 --> 01:18:55.347
MARISHA: Reverence.

01:18:55.347 --> 01:18:56.548
TALIESIN: Reverence.

01:18:56.548 --> 01:19:00.696
LIAM: You can certainly acknowledge when someone
can squash you like a bug.

01:19:00.696 --> 01:19:02.186
TALIESIN: Yes.

01:19:02.186 --> 01:19:10.480
MARISHA: But a lot of things can squish us like
bugs. I don't know, this is complicated. Let's

01:19:10.480 --> 01:19:15.602
just keep going. I'm going to keep an eye out
while we're walking, for anything that resembles

01:19:15.602 --> 01:19:17.307
the Sun Tree.

01:19:17.307 --> 01:19:20.277
MATT: Okay. All right. Are you leading the way?

01:19:20.277 --> 01:19:21.287
LAURA: Yeah.

01:19:21.287 --> 01:19:27.217
MATT: Because you have no sun to keep tabs on,
you're just going to have to fly up above the

01:19:27.217 --> 01:19:34.425
canopy and keep an eye on it, so you're cresting
and descending through the orchard as you

01:19:34.425 --> 01:19:40.823
progress. You travel for about an hour and a half
to two hours, and you notice you are getting

01:19:40.823 --> 01:19:47.854
closer, but it is a long way away, you probably
have another three, four hours of travel before

01:19:47.854 --> 01:19:49.549
you get there on foot.

01:19:49.549 --> 01:19:52.246
LAURA: It's a long trek. We've got a while.

01:19:52.246 --> 01:19:55.044
MARISHA: I wonder if we believe harder if we'll
get there quicker.

01:19:55.044 --> 01:19:58.248
TALIESIN: I don't believe that'll work.

01:19:58.248 --> 01:20:02.837
SAM: Well, let's just go.

01:20:02.837 --> 01:20:05.478
LAURA: Just keep on pushing on?

01:20:05.478 --> 01:20:07.752
SAM: Yeah.

01:20:07.752 --> 01:20:12.919
LAURA: Right? We don't have anything that'll make us
move faster?

01:20:12.919 --> 01:20:15.514
TALIESIN: Well, we have misty, but that seems--

01:20:15.539 --> 01:20:16.857
LAURA: That seems stupid.

01:20:16.857 --> 01:20:18.625
TALIESIN: It's a nice walk.

01:20:18.625 --> 01:20:19.997
LAURA: Yeah, it's beautiful.

01:20:19.997 --> 01:20:28.368
MATT: You guys continue your trek, and as you get
closer and closer to the fortress of the sun, you

01:20:28.368 --> 01:20:39.502
do notice the trees of the orchard grow taller and
thicker. And it's like whatever fertility

01:20:39.502 --> 01:20:43.624
enchantment that runs this section of the plane,
the closer to the central portion of this fortress

01:20:43.624 --> 01:20:52.129
you get, the more the rampant wild growth seems to
gather and expand to the point where it, in some

01:20:52.129 --> 01:20:58.991
places, almost resembles the Feywild, though
nowhere near as mysterious and threatening in some

01:20:58.991 --> 01:21:07.191
cases. But you've never seen apple trees that
grow four stories tall. But here you see them.

01:21:07.191 --> 01:21:13.651
And the scale is immense but the branches are as
dense with apples and leaves as they would be

01:21:13.651 --> 01:21:20.971
elsewhere. It continues to go. It's an impossible
size to some of these trees and plants and bushes.

01:21:20.971 --> 01:21:26.726
It dwarfs your size by comparison to where you
really get a sense of scale of how small you may

01:21:26.726 --> 01:21:30.933
be in this realm versus some of the creatures that
call it home.

01:21:30.933 --> 01:21:38.155
MARISHA: See, this tree can squash me like a bug.
If it fell on me, yeah.

01:21:38.155 --> 01:21:44.511
LAURA: I wonder if its apple grew as big as the
actual tree. If it fell, you'd be doomed.

01:21:44.511 --> 01:21:53.835
MATT: As you progress, a few more hours into this
trek, eventually, Vex, you begin to notice the

01:21:53.835 --> 01:21:56.581
light ahead begins to grow brighter.

01:21:56.581 --> 01:21:58.635
LAURA: Hey, I think we're getting closer.

01:21:58.635 --> 01:22:00.423
SAM: Awesome.

01:22:00.423 --> 01:22:05.342
MARISHA: Does this feel like sunlight? Does it
register like sunlight or is it a whiter light?

01:22:05.342 --> 01:22:07.450
LAURA: Like should we put some sunblock on as we
walk towards it?

01:22:07.450 --> 01:22:09.652
MARISHA: Yeah? Is it sunlight temperature?

01:22:09.652 --> 01:22:12.117
MATT: It registers as a sunlight. It is a pure
light.

01:22:12.117 --> 01:22:15.780
TALIESIN: Like kitchen light white or like reading
room light?

01:22:15.780 --> 01:22:20.708
MATT: Like noon daylight light.

01:22:20.708 --> 01:22:24.671
TRAVIS: Arizona or California?

01:22:24.671 --> 01:22:30.980
MATT: And as you push closer and closer to where
this brightness continues to expand, and it's

01:22:30.980 --> 01:22:43.404
brighter than you anticipated. You're getting to
the edge of a clearing where the tree line comes to

01:22:43.404 --> 01:22:49.462
a halt, but as you do, it hurts your eyes a little
bit. You have to adjust from the dark interior of

01:22:49.462 --> 01:22:56.233
the forest to the outside. And as you finally
breach the edge of the tree line and look out, you

01:22:56.233 --> 01:23:02.342
can see this open clearing, and immediately you
can see the column of light that's cracking down

01:23:02.342 --> 01:23:08.646
from the center of the sky is what is lining this
clearing; where the light touches, the trees stop.

01:23:08.646 --> 01:23:16.319
And it hurts a little bit to look at it because
the light is reflecting off of this bright gold

01:23:16.319 --> 01:23:23.340
brass-colored citadel before you. You thought the
crystal structure that Sarenrae was in was, you

01:23:23.340 --> 01:23:29.752
know, impressive. This is four times larger than
the largest structures in Vasselheim or Emon

01:23:29.752 --> 01:23:41.283
you've ever encountered. And you watch as this
massive citadel-- It has maybe two dozen separate

01:23:41.283 --> 01:23:45.715
towers of different heights that stagger and shift
and they all come to these steeple-like points.

01:23:45.715 --> 01:23:51.616
And there in the center of the structure is one
thick, massive tower that crawls upward and upward

01:23:51.616 --> 01:24:01.438
and upward and upward for, even at this point,
surmising 15, 20 stories before the tip vanishes

01:24:01.438 --> 01:24:06.644
into the bright light that is descending from the
sky above. You see the outline of a few sparse

01:24:06.644 --> 01:24:13.282
trees that catch your attention. You do see some
trees that litter this open space within this

01:24:13.282 --> 01:24:17.954
bright light that are of the same type of tree as
the Sun Tree that resides in the center of

01:24:17.954 --> 01:24:19.202
Whitestone.

01:24:19.202 --> 01:24:21.140
MARISHA: He does have a twin.

01:24:21.140 --> 01:24:29.581
LAURA: Do you think this tower is compensating for
something, or maybe it's a representation. Hard to

01:24:29.581 --> 01:24:31.049
tell.

01:24:31.049 --> 01:24:35.620
TRAVIS: Basically we'll know Vecna's a god if
another skyscraper forms in Elysium somewhere.

01:24:35.620 --> 01:24:40.238
MARISHA: How close are we to the column of light?

01:24:40.238 --> 01:24:45.291
MATT: You're stepping beyond the treeline and into
the light, so you're just at the edge of the tree

01:24:45.291 --> 01:24:46.031
line.

01:24:46.031 --> 01:24:52.014
MARISHA: I Druidcraft a little twig and hold it
into the light column.

01:24:52.014 --> 01:24:54.143
MATT: Okay. Doesn't seem to affect it at all.

01:24:54.143 --> 01:24:57.941
MARISHA: Nothing? I'm going to touch it.

01:24:57.941 --> 01:25:01.654
MATT: It's warm. It's like warm daylight.

01:25:01.654 --> 01:25:03.669
MARISHA: Okay, we're not going to die.

01:25:03.669 --> 01:25:04.695
LAURA: That's good.

01:25:04.695 --> 01:25:05.812
TRAVIS: Are you sure?

01:25:05.812 --> 01:25:06.880
MARISHA: No.

01:25:06.880 --> 01:25:12.594
LAURA: (laughs) I'm going to look at the citadel
with my eyes wide open for five seconds, and then

01:25:12.594 --> 01:25:15.622
close my eyes really fast to see if I can see
better details of it like when you look at the

01:25:15.622 --> 01:25:16.634
sun.

01:25:16.634 --> 01:25:18.580
MATT: (laughs) You do, actually!

01:25:18.580 --> 01:25:20.842
LIAM: I swat my sister in the forehead.

01:25:20.842 --> 01:25:25.111
LAURA: Hey, I'm doing stuff here; it's science.

01:25:25.111 --> 01:25:31.804
MATT: In closing your eyes, yeah, you can see the
shape and the outline of the spires that go off,

01:25:31.804 --> 01:25:35.497
and you can see the plating and the large, heavy
structures. And you can see the various windows

01:25:35.497 --> 01:25:39.515
that dot the outside on multiple levels. It looks
like there's at least seven or eight different

01:25:39.515 --> 01:25:46.441
levels of the actual fortress. You see lines of
windows and looks to be balconies that adorn it at

01:25:46.441 --> 01:25:50.846
these different stages. And at the top of that,
the towers go higher and higher. It's almost like

01:25:50.846 --> 01:25:56.115
a city of a fortress in its own right in its
scale. It's impressive. It's like if you took part

01:25:56.115 --> 01:26:00.585
of the City of Brass and jammed it into one
structure and made it pure gold.

01:26:00.585 --> 01:26:05.442
TRAVIS: Pure gold?

01:26:05.442 --> 01:26:06.984
MATT: It's gorgeous.

01:26:06.984 --> 01:26:09.237
LAURA: This is beautiful!

01:26:09.237 --> 01:26:11.858
MATT: (laughs) But it does burn the shit out of
your eyes if you stare at it that long.

01:26:11.858 --> 01:26:19.837
LAURA: Worth it! Worth every second! I like Pelor.
I like him a lot.

01:26:19.837 --> 01:26:23.530
TRAVIS: Someone should go in and test out the
light.

01:26:23.530 --> 01:26:26.141
SAM: Yeah, let's just go in. It's just light.

01:26:26.141 --> 01:26:28.355
MARISHA: Maybe the light will take us there,
straight to him.

01:26:28.355 --> 01:26:29.696
TRAVIS: I push Vax in.

01:26:29.696 --> 01:26:30.755
MARISHA: I jump in.

01:26:30.755 --> 01:26:33.976
MATT: You push Vax in? All right.

01:26:33.976 --> 01:26:35.614
LIAM: Oh, warm again!

01:26:35.614 --> 01:26:38.125
(laughter)

01:26:38.125 --> 01:26:47.235
MATT: It's very warm. And with your dark leather
it's like the goth kid in summer. Little sweaty.

01:26:47.235 --> 01:26:50.592
LIAM: I was never the goth kid.

01:26:50.592 --> 01:26:58.520
MATT: You guys begin to make your way on foot,
trekking towards the center of this clearing,

01:26:58.520 --> 01:27:11.180
towards the fortress of the sun. As you begin to
make your way beyond the various trees with their

01:27:11.180 --> 01:27:17.796
blossoming, beautiful white, pink, and purple
blossoms that mark the Sun Tree during the spring

01:27:17.796 --> 01:27:25.879
and summer, you can now see along the perimeter of
this what appear to be hundreds of figures.

01:27:25.879 --> 01:27:30.750
Hundreds of figures that just dot the outside of
the fortress. And as you get a better look at some of

01:27:30.750 --> 01:27:36.043
the spires you can see that on the upper levels,
including the one central tower, you can see these

01:27:36.043 --> 01:27:42.619
beautiful medallion-like circles of stained glass,
mosaics of color on a scale that is impressive.

01:27:42.619 --> 01:27:48.269
You can only surmise maybe the smallest one being
20 feet in diameter and going up from there on the

01:27:48.269 --> 01:27:53.877
scale on the central portions of it. And what's
interesting is, usually with stained glass the bright

01:27:53.877 --> 01:27:59.960
exterior, the color is darkened and shaded because
the light is once you're inside the structure, but

01:27:59.960 --> 01:28:06.249
the color is so vibrant in the stained glass, you
get the sense that there is a light source within

01:28:06.249 --> 01:28:11.162
the actual fortress that is as bright if not
brighter than the column of light that is

01:28:11.162 --> 01:28:12.920
descending from the sky.

01:28:12.920 --> 01:28:15.021
LAURA: Should've worn sunglasses here.

01:28:15.021 --> 01:28:23.061
MATT: As you begin to get closer and closer to the
citadel, once again the scale seems to build and

01:28:23.061 --> 01:28:28.600
build. What should seem to be a shorter walk gets
longer and longer as you begin to see how massive

01:28:28.600 --> 01:28:34.774
and far away this is, compared to where you
thought it was. And about 30 minutes since you

01:28:34.774 --> 01:28:41.252
left the treeline, you begin to just get past the
final bit of Sun Trees that are planted around the

01:28:41.252 --> 01:28:42.353
exterior.

01:28:42.353 --> 01:28:45.813
MARISHA: I touch a few as I walk by. See if I feel
anything.

01:28:45.813 --> 01:28:51.883
MATT: They're alive, they're vibrant and similar
in texture as to the one you've spoken with in

01:28:51.883 --> 01:28:53.249
Whitestone.

01:28:53.249 --> 01:28:55.657
LAURA: You going to try talking to them?

01:28:55.657 --> 01:28:57.307
MARISHA: Should I?

01:28:57.307 --> 01:28:58.875
LAURA and TALIESIN: I don't know.

01:28:58.875 --> 01:29:00.439
TRAVIS: Do you know this tree?

01:29:00.439 --> 01:29:05.061
MARISHA: I don't know. Maybe he's like a distant
relative of the Sun Tree. Maybe I know him by

01:29:05.061 --> 01:29:06.232
proxy.

01:29:06.232 --> 01:29:10.970
LAURA: Maybe they're like, oh yeah, Sun Tree I
remember him, he got taken away as a seedling, but

01:29:10.970 --> 01:29:13.285
he was really great. How's he doing?

01:29:13.285 --> 01:29:16.275
LIAM: I mean, you know you want to.

01:29:16.275 --> 01:29:19.160
TRAVIS: It's an Elysium tree, just saying.

01:29:19.160 --> 01:29:21.772
LAURA: Maybe they don't even speak our language.
It's possible.

01:29:21.772 --> 01:29:24.944
LIAM: This is a once in a lifetime opportunity,
Kiki.

01:29:24.944 --> 01:29:29.200
MARISHA: I'll try and speak to one of the Sun
Trees that looks the most friendly.

01:29:29.200 --> 01:29:30.477
TRAVIS: (laughing) Amicable tree.

01:29:30.477 --> 01:29:37.155
MATT: Make a nature check. See which one seems the
most approachable of all the other trees.

01:29:37.155 --> 01:29:39.442
TRAVIS: Weigh the nuts.

01:29:39.442 --> 01:29:43.675
MARISHA: That's a natural one. I don't know.

01:29:43.675 --> 01:29:48.306
MATT: You see one tree that looks definitely the
most amiable of the ones in the field and you

01:29:48.306 --> 01:29:49.486
approach it.

01:29:49.486 --> 01:29:50.485
MARISHA: Amiable?

01:29:50.485 --> 01:29:52.706
MATT: Amicable. Pick your term.

01:29:52.706 --> 01:29:58.979
MARISHA: Amicable, amiable. All right, I'll talk
to a tree. That's what I'm going to do.

01:29:58.979 --> 01:30:04.833
MATT: As you finish your spell and reach out, your
finger touching the warm exterior of the tree. The

01:30:04.833 --> 01:30:07.995
light's still a little blinding, but you've
adjusted to it now, where you can make out shapes

01:30:07.995 --> 01:30:13.476
and color, as opposed to the blaring white. What
do you say?

01:30:13.476 --> 01:30:26.187
MARISHA: Hey, Sun Tree bro. Are you a Sun Tree
bro? Are you a Sun Tree brother? What's your

01:30:26.187 --> 01:30:27.447
name?

01:30:27.447 --> 01:30:35.963
MATT: "I'm a tree of the sun. And I'm not your
bro."

01:30:35.997 --> 01:30:43.498
MARISHA: No, I didn't know if you knew the Sun
Tree that grew in Whitestone on the Prime Material

01:30:43.498 --> 01:30:45.293
Plane. I didn't know if you knew him.

01:30:45.293 --> 01:30:48.298
MATT: "So because I'm a tree of the sun, you
assume that I know all other trees of the sun. Is

01:30:48.298 --> 01:30:57.610
"that what this is? It's one of those things? We
all look alike, don't we? Just all of us trees of

01:30:57.610 --> 01:30:59.335
"the sun, right?"

01:30:59.335 --> 01:31:04.916
MARISHA: Can you tell me a little about this
plane? How do we talk to Pelor? How do we see

01:31:04.916 --> 01:31:06.217
him?

01:31:06.217 --> 01:31:11.108
MATT: "I recommend probably going towards the
giant golden fortress that is right behind you.

01:31:11.108 --> 01:31:13.927
"It's probably a good place to look, where all the
light's coming from."

01:31:13.927 --> 01:31:24.760
MARISHA: Okay. Yeah. Wow. I have a friend who wants to
know about the fruit. He's wondering if the fruit

01:31:24.760 --> 01:31:29.697
is souls? If he can eat the fruit.

01:31:29.697 --> 01:31:32.739
MATT: "The fruit is not souls! It's fruit."

01:31:32.739 --> 01:31:35.058
TRAVIS: Vindication!

01:31:35.058 --> 01:31:43.382
MATT: "The Dawnfather is the god of the harvest.
Good luck. Sorry if I came off a bit brusque. It's

01:31:43.382 --> 01:31:45.884
"been a long time since anyone's talked to me."

01:31:45.884 --> 01:31:49.089
MARISHA: No, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to offend
you.

01:31:49.089 --> 01:31:51.506
MATT: "Apology accepted."

01:31:51.506 --> 01:31:55.008
MARISHA: Would you like a hug?

01:31:55.008 --> 01:31:58.447
MATT: "No. I would most definitely not like a
hug."

01:31:58.447 --> 01:32:08.571
MARISHA: Okay. Well, it was wonderful meeting you.
Absolutely. Thank you. All right, bye. Okay, bye.

01:32:08.571 --> 01:32:11.515
MATT: "Good day."

01:32:11.515 --> 01:32:15.189
TALIESIN: What a beautiful tree you've found. It
casts so much shade.

01:32:15.189 --> 01:32:21.185
(laughter)

01:32:21.185 --> 01:32:22.588
TRAVIS: Yes! Oh my god.

01:32:22.588 --> 01:32:25.052
MARISHA: You were waiting the whole time to use
that, weren't you? The whole conversation.

01:32:25.052 --> 01:32:29.330
TALIESIN: I was just sitting, like knitting,
crochet?

01:32:29.330 --> 01:32:37.577
MATT: As soon as you rolled that one, I was like
okay, then.

01:32:37.577 --> 01:32:43.215
SAM: New NPC: Dick Tree.

01:32:43.215 --> 01:32:45.743
(laughter)

01:32:45.743 --> 01:32:53.719
MATT: It's more ornery than anything. (laughs)
All right, as Keyleth returns from her

01:32:53.719 --> 01:32:56.442
conversation with the tree.

01:32:56.442 --> 01:33:03.026
LIAM: You don't seem as blissed out as you
normally do. Did it go okay?

01:33:03.026 --> 01:33:12.480
MARISHA: Yeah, it was fine. Just can't talk to
everybody, I guess. It's fine.

01:33:12.515 --> 01:33:14.837
TRAVIS: What did you ask him?

01:33:14.837 --> 01:33:21.222
MARISHA: Nothing. Just asked if he knew the Sun
Tree, and he got super offended. You know what?

01:33:21.222 --> 01:33:22.914
Let's just go.

01:33:22.914 --> 01:33:26.383
TALIESIN: You've never been rejected by a tree
before, have you?

01:33:26.383 --> 01:33:31.787
MARISHA: No, I have never been rejected by a tree.
Most trees like me. People don't like me, but at

01:33:31.787 --> 01:33:34.670
least trees do, except for this asshole.

01:33:34.670 --> 01:33:42.540
LIAM: I start to smooth out her mantle, which is
wiring up like a cat's.

01:33:42.540 --> 01:33:46.519
MARISHA: My leaves are prickly.

01:33:46.519 --> 01:33:49.487
LAURA: Maybe he was just pretending he didn't like
you because he felt uncomfortable because he likes

01:33:49.487 --> 01:33:52.356
you so much. Like Kash!

01:33:52.356 --> 01:34:00.274
MARISHA: That's nice, Vex. Thanks. You didn't talk
to this guy, okay? You don't know.

01:34:00.274 --> 01:34:02.517
TRAVIS: Did you ask about the fruit?

01:34:02.517 --> 01:34:07.435
MARISHA: Yeah, he said it's fruit. It's fine. You
can eat it, too. You're right, Grog. You were

01:34:07.435 --> 01:34:11.214
right! Eat the fruit! Let's go! Come on.

01:34:11.214 --> 01:34:13.545
SAM: Yikes.

01:34:13.545 --> 01:34:15.557
LAURA: Breathe in, breathe out.

01:34:15.557 --> 01:34:24.984
MATT: All right, you guys begin making your trek
back towards the Fortress of the Sun. As you're

01:34:24.984 --> 01:34:26.288
walking--

01:34:26.288 --> 01:34:29.609
MARISHA: I rip off an apple as I go, and I start
aggressively eating it.

01:34:29.609 --> 01:34:32.456
MATT: The Sun Trees here don't bear fruit.

01:34:32.456 --> 01:34:35.213
MARISHA: I fucking spike an apple that I had
earlier!

01:34:35.213 --> 01:34:37.829
MATT: Okay. If you have an apple with you, you're
welcome to eat it if you wanted to.

01:34:37.829 --> 01:34:40.901
MARISHA: No! I just want to go in the tower.

01:34:40.901 --> 01:34:46.870
LIAM: I lean over to Percival and say, this is one
of those times when it's best just to keep quiet.

01:34:46.870 --> 01:34:50.739
TALIESIN: I'm so quietly delighted by this.

01:34:50.739 --> 01:34:58.458
MATT: All right. As you guys begin to approach the
fortress, you watch as those hundreds of figures

01:34:58.458 --> 01:35:03.886
you saw at the base are beginning to collect
towards the front of what appears to be the large

01:35:03.886 --> 01:35:07.934
doors that lead to this side's entrance to the
actual structure. As they gather, they begin to

01:35:07.934 --> 01:35:12.008
push in your direction. You also see other figures
up on the higher floors, balconies, almost.

01:35:12.008 --> 01:35:18.033
(wingbeat, whoosh) Glide and then flying in your
direction rather rapidly.

01:35:18.033 --> 01:35:23.477
LAURA: I hope they're friendly. He's definitely
not as solitary as Sarenrae, is he?

01:35:23.477 --> 01:35:28.835
MATT: At this point, you watch as these winged
entities, three of them, approach faster than the

01:35:28.835 --> 01:35:35.856
rest of the horde that seems to be pushing in your
direction. You can see long, golden-white wings.

01:35:35.856 --> 01:35:46.486
You see very intense-looking breastplates made of
gold and brass, with rubies marked into it.

01:35:46.486 --> 01:35:53.375
Similar, but not as well adorned as the armor that
Pike wears. Holding spears, various other weapons

01:35:53.375 --> 01:35:58.261
or shields, but as they fly in and land, (impact
noise) landing. They all stand about five or six

01:35:58.261 --> 01:36:03.829
feet taller than all of you. Humanoid, muscular,
almost Roman in physique, but their skin is a very

01:36:03.829 --> 01:36:06.887
faint light blue. Their eyes are white.

01:36:06.887 --> 01:36:09.771
LAURA: Hunin and Kyor!

01:36:09.771 --> 01:36:13.445
MARISHA: Are they devas? Celestials?

01:36:13.445 --> 01:36:16.762
Angels!

01:36:16.762 --> 01:36:18.160
LIAM: Celestials.

01:36:18.160 --> 01:36:25.641
MATT: They have similar traits, though apparently
purer and much stronger than the half-blood

01:36:25.641 --> 01:36:28.286
celestials that you had met previously in the City
of Brass.

01:36:28.286 --> 01:36:31.507
LAURA: That we rescued. Didn't just meet them. We
saved them.

01:36:31.507 --> 01:36:36.027
MATT: You did, and you gave them a new life under
the remaining family of--

01:36:36.027 --> 01:36:39.595
LAURA: Hunin and Kyor. I even got their fucking
names right!

01:36:39.595 --> 01:36:41.087
MATT: You did, which is awesome.

01:36:41.087 --> 01:36:42.550
LIAM: The third time, yeah.

01:36:42.550 --> 01:36:49.138
MATT: So as the three of them land (impacts)
around you, spears not aggressive, but at their

01:36:49.138 --> 01:36:55.599
side, and powerful entities. They triangulate
around you, all standing so much taller than you

01:36:55.599 --> 01:37:02.947
do, their wings still unfurled in a very prominent
display of power. Their helmets covering everything--

01:37:02.947 --> 01:37:08.902
the helmet comes down over the nose and reveals
the eyes. It's very Roman in structure. One of

01:37:08.902 --> 01:37:14.694
them yells out, "You who approaches the fortress.
What is your business here?"

01:37:14.694 --> 01:37:17.378
TRAVIS: Guards. Best to let Scanlan and I take
this.

01:37:17.378 --> 01:37:20.517
(laughter)

01:37:20.517 --> 01:37:23.571
LIAM: Percy, do you want to flash a little
Whitestone bling, at the moment?

01:37:23.571 --> 01:37:27.029
TALIESIN: You're pretty Whitestone blinged.

01:37:27.029 --> 01:37:32.178
LAURA: We're Vox Machina. We were sent here to
speak to Pelor by the goddess Sarenrae.

01:37:32.178 --> 01:37:35.758
MATT: "Sarenrae sent you?"

01:37:35.758 --> 01:37:37.597
LAURA: Yes, she did.

01:37:37.597 --> 01:37:39.448
MATT: "With what business?"

01:37:39.448 --> 01:37:43.846
LAURA: To speak about a very big evil growing on
the Material Plane.

01:37:43.846 --> 01:37:46.850
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

01:37:46.850 --> 01:37:56.275
LAURA: Oh no. Okay. 22?

01:37:56.275 --> 01:38:04.960
MATT: Okay. The one guard that you were talking to
looks over to the guard that's to the left of all

01:38:04.960 --> 01:38:09.807
of you, and he gives him this slight head nudge.
That one, who's a little bit smaller than the other

01:38:09.807 --> 01:38:17.148
two, walks past and his pupil-less white eyes,
which emanate this faint white glow, seem to look

01:38:17.148 --> 01:38:23.458
past each of you. I say past each of you. It
almost is a piercing gaze. As it looks at Scanlan,

01:38:23.458 --> 01:38:36.475
it gives a little bit of an upturn of the nose. A
neutral disapproval of Percival. Keyleth, less so.

01:38:36.475 --> 01:38:49.237
Grog, almost a sneer for a moment. And then to Vax
and Vex. And then to Pike, a nod.

01:38:49.237 --> 01:38:50.924
SAM: Oh, a nod.

01:38:50.924 --> 01:38:52.509
LAURA: She's good.

01:38:52.509 --> 01:38:57.425
MATT: He looks back to the first guard, and says,
"There is no evil among them."

01:38:57.425 --> 01:39:02.529
LAURA: Hear that, Grog? You're not evil.

01:39:02.529 --> 01:39:04.889
TRAVIS: Yeah, I knew that. Why didn't you just
ask?

01:39:04.889 --> 01:39:12.344
TALIESIN: We do, it should be noted, carry a
dangerous artifact that we should warn you of.

01:39:12.344 --> 01:39:14.919
SAM: Check in our weapons. Yeah.

01:39:14.919 --> 01:39:21.067
MATT: The one soldier that you were first speaking
to steps forward, his heavy footfalls from his

01:39:21.067 --> 01:39:24.282
armored boots. He puts his hand out. "We will take
this artifact."

01:39:24.282 --> 01:39:27.820
LAURA and SAM: (hesitant noises) Will we get it
back?

01:39:27.820 --> 01:39:32.170
MATT: "What need do you have with a dangerous
artifact?"

01:39:32.170 --> 01:39:38.861
LAURA: Well, it belongs to the great evil, and so
it's possible that we can use it to defeat him, so

01:39:38.861 --> 01:39:41.539
if we don't have it, we might not be able to do
that.

01:39:41.539 --> 01:39:43.348
TRAVIS: It may give us an advantage.

01:39:43.348 --> 01:39:44.899
LAURA: Could be really great.

01:39:44.899 --> 01:39:46.680
MATT: "The Dawnfather will be the judge of that."

01:39:46.680 --> 01:39:47.701
LAURA: Okay.

01:39:47.701 --> 01:39:49.209
TALIESIN: I'm all right with that.

01:39:49.209 --> 01:39:57.192
SAM: Don't look at it, though. It'll turn you
super evil, and you'll rip out your eye.

01:39:57.192 --> 01:40:06.269
MATT: "Noted." Such a big thing, and yet you shook
it a little, strangely. "Very well. Follow us,

01:40:06.269 --> 01:40:07.210
"please."

01:40:07.210 --> 01:40:09.018
SAM: How's that fruit?

01:40:09.018 --> 01:40:15.789
MATT: Their wings fold behind them, and they walk
alongside you, matching their gait to yours. As

01:40:15.789 --> 01:40:20.112
you move forward, even with your brisk pace, their
gait is so long that they're having to make long,

01:40:20.112 --> 01:40:23.782
slow strides to keep up with your slow pace.

01:40:23.782 --> 01:40:26.218
LAURA: I hold Percy's hand as we're going in.

01:40:26.218 --> 01:40:30.709
TALIESIN: Yeah, we'll do this together. I'm all
right.

01:40:30.709 --> 01:40:37.550
MATT: At this point, the mass army that's been
approaching you, you can see now, are hundreds of

01:40:37.550 --> 01:40:46.250
armored spirits, similar to those that you saw in
the orchard. As they approach, the three planar

01:40:46.250 --> 01:40:51.881
entities that are walking alongside you put their
hand up in a dismissive motion, and the army

01:40:51.881 --> 01:40:57.524
parts, leaving a singular path that leads you
right to the front of the fortress. And the path,

01:40:57.524 --> 01:41:02.293
because there's so many, goes on. It's like
walking through a parade of silence. As you all

01:41:02.293 --> 01:41:07.637
look around, you can't make out any faces. You see
hundreds of sets of glittering golden armor with

01:41:07.637 --> 01:41:14.743
the somewhat-visible form of these translucent
spiritual entities that take up the space. You

01:41:14.743 --> 01:41:20.913
don't sense any hostility, animosity. You don't
sense any welcoming. You don't sense anything from

01:41:20.913 --> 01:41:23.203
them. They're present and letting you pass.

01:41:23.203 --> 01:41:24.761
LAURA: Is the armor solid?

01:41:24.761 --> 01:41:32.181
MATT: Yes, the armor is solid, and the spirits
that inhabit them are pseudo-material. It's hard

01:41:32.181 --> 01:41:36.042
for you to gauge; you haven't encountered this
type of creature outside of your spectral

01:41:36.042 --> 01:41:43.193
encounters with ghosts and other spirits. As you
step forward, being flanked and escorted by these

01:41:43.193 --> 01:41:51.902
winged guards, you are brought to the base of the
50 or so steps that ascend to the front 40-foot-tall

01:41:51.902 --> 01:42:01.929
double doors that now (loud creaking) creak
open to reveal the interior of the palace, which

01:42:01.929 --> 01:42:08.584
is as bright, if not brighter from the inside as
the outside pillar of light you're leaving.

01:42:08.584 --> 01:42:15.493
As you prepare yourselves to adjust your gaze, you
ascend step by step to eventually take in whatever

01:42:15.493 --> 01:42:19.393
the interior of the Fortress of the Sun has to
offer. And that's where we're going to take our

01:42:19.393 --> 01:42:26.333
break! We're going to return back here in a few
minutes. We're going to use the restroom and get

01:42:26.333 --> 01:42:28.999
snacks and stuff. You guys can rest here for a
minute. We have a giveaway.

01:42:28.999 --> 01:42:31.203
TRAVIS and MARISHA: Fruit.

01:42:31.203 --> 01:42:33.127
TALIESIN: Don't eat the spiky bit.

01:42:33.127 --> 01:42:35.476
MATT: That's right. Make a wisdom saving throw
real fast.

01:42:35.476 --> 01:42:36.443
TRAVIS: Really?

01:42:36.443 --> 01:42:38.053
MARISHA: Wait, really?

01:42:38.053 --> 01:42:39.122
MATT: Yeah.

01:42:39.122 --> 01:42:40.279
LIAM: Everybody?

01:42:40.279 --> 01:42:42.603
LAURA: No, just Grog, because he's an idiot.

01:42:42.603 --> 01:42:43.884
TRAVIS: 13.

01:42:43.884 --> 01:42:46.233
MATT: 13. Okay, good to know. All right.

01:42:46.233 --> 01:42:50.363
MARISHA: Maybe you would have gotten smarter.
Maybe it's super fruit. Maybe it's acai berries.

01:42:50.363 --> 01:42:56.579
MATT: All right, so our friends at Wyrmwood have
this awesome black walnut personal dice tray with

01:42:56.579 --> 01:43:01.600
a leather interior. It's pretty badass. We'll only
have one lucky winner over in the Twitch chat. The

01:43:01.600 --> 01:43:08.531
key word for tonight is latency. L-A-T-E-N-C-Y.
Like the kind that you get when you have two

01:43:08.531 --> 01:43:13.176
people on Skype guesting in. So to win this, find
your way over to Twitch chat, follow the

01:43:13.176 --> 01:43:16.324
instructions, and when it's time, put the word
'latency' in, and one lucky winner at the end of the

01:43:16.324 --> 01:43:20.480
break we'll be able to give this away to and
announce. Enjoy, rest. We'll see you guys back

01:43:20.480 --> 01:43:22.576
here in a few minutes.

01:43:22.576 --> 02:02:41.084
[break]

02:02:41.136 --> 02:02:44.688
MATT: Hello, everyone, and welcome back to
Critical Role. First and foremost, the winner of

02:02:44.688 --> 02:02:48.695
the chatroom contest-- and I hope I'm reading this
right-- is n-nailhammer.

02:02:48.695 --> 02:02:51.152
(laughter)

02:02:51.152 --> 02:02:52.354
TRAVIS: Wait, one more time.

02:02:52.354 --> 02:02:53.755
MATT: Nnailhammer.

02:02:53.755 --> 02:02:55.169
TALIESIN: Is it Nine Inch Nail hammer?

02:02:55.169 --> 02:03:03.598
MATT: It's two N's, ailhammer. So nnailhammer.
Congratulations, nnailhammer. You won the

02:03:03.598 --> 02:03:12.134
giveaway. Denobo will contact you and get you the
info. Congratulations! All right, so back in to

02:03:12.134 --> 02:03:14.075
where we left off.

02:03:14.075 --> 02:03:24.287
As you ascend the remainder of the stairs and step
into the entryway to the Fortress of the Sun,

02:03:24.287 --> 02:03:31.837
you're led through a series of gorgeous silver and
gold archways, dozens of feet above you. The

02:03:31.837 --> 02:03:38.323
intricacies of the interior, scrolling trim and
inlay across every wall, pillar, and bannister is

02:03:38.323 --> 02:03:46.210
incredible. Not gaudy, just magnificent in purpose
and history. Glancing across the marble floor, you

02:03:46.210 --> 02:03:52.150
can see the construction here is immaculate. There
isn't any sort of smudge or damage dealt anywhere.

02:03:52.150 --> 02:03:59.186
These arches themselves, even as you glance over
and look, the detail seems to fractal smaller and

02:03:59.186 --> 02:04:04.489
smaller, in places, where you can't imagine a
craftsman's hand could have built this. Only

02:04:04.489 --> 02:04:09.777
through the will of a god could such a thing come
into creation on such a vast and minor scale.

02:04:09.777 --> 02:04:20.820
You also notice as you walk in, there's no shadow
or shade. The walls seem to almost emanate light

02:04:20.820 --> 02:04:22.116
on their own.

02:04:22.116 --> 02:04:23.515
MARISHA: I beg to differ.

02:04:23.515 --> 02:04:25.290
MATT: The outside's a different story.

02:04:25.290 --> 02:04:26.482
MARISHA: Go to the courtyard.

02:04:26.482 --> 02:04:28.109
LIAM: Just you wait!

02:04:28.109 --> 02:04:30.860
LAURA: No shadow underneath us?

02:04:30.860 --> 02:04:36.175
MATT: No shadow underneath you. Looking around
you, and looking at your hands, you can see very

02:04:36.175 --> 02:04:41.283
faint shadows can be cast between your fingers and
things that are very close, but it's like there's

02:04:41.283 --> 02:04:45.620
a diffused light throughout the entirety of the
interior of the fortress that casts away any

02:04:45.620 --> 02:04:53.069
darkness or shadow. There's no umbra; there's no
place where light is absent. It is just light

02:04:53.069 --> 02:04:54.282
everywhere.

02:04:54.282 --> 02:05:03.370
You hear this soft music played, the deeper into
the fortress you get.

02:05:03.370 --> 02:05:07.083
MARISHA: Club's over here, guys.

02:05:07.083 --> 02:05:09.350
MATT: Rocks fall; everybody dies.

02:05:09.350 --> 02:05:13.476
(laughter)

02:05:13.476 --> 02:05:15.546
MATT: It's okay.

02:05:15.546 --> 02:05:18.209
LIAM: Benny Hill music commences.

02:05:18.209 --> 02:05:25.729
MATT: Soft music you hear playing throughout the
interior of the fortress, like this distant sound

02:05:25.729 --> 02:05:31.635
of a thousand soft choir voices accompanying the
inspirational sight of the building that you now

02:05:31.635 --> 02:05:38.740
walk through. You see other entities adorned in
armor, still opaque and pearlescent in their

02:05:38.740 --> 02:05:45.557
spirit form. Some of them have flowing robes of
gold and white that trail behind them and drift

02:05:45.557 --> 02:05:47.597
across the floor silently.

02:05:47.597 --> 02:05:54.007
The further in you walk, you begin to see where
some of these spires and spiral staircases twist

02:05:54.007 --> 02:06:00.857
upward. The rooms have purpose in construction, but
the scale of those that walk through the halls is

02:06:00.857 --> 02:06:07.627
so varied that you see staircases on large scales
and small scales. They almost seem to wrap around

02:06:07.627 --> 02:06:13.022
each other in places. It's surreal, almost
Escher-esque in some of the interior

02:06:13.022 --> 02:06:14.307
construction.

02:06:14.307 --> 02:06:20.421
You see archways and doorways on different levels:
some that appear to be reached only by those that

02:06:20.421 --> 02:06:26.608
can fly versus those that can just walk and climb.
Occasionally, you look up and you can see

02:06:26.608 --> 02:06:34.907
skylights across the top: some open glass and
crystal, some appearing to be a small window of

02:06:34.907 --> 02:06:40.388
stained glass that glitters down in bright blues,
purples, reds, oranges. There's definitely a

02:06:40.388 --> 02:06:45.472
stained glass motif in a lot of the interior of
the fortress, which you've seen in some of Pelor's

02:06:45.472 --> 02:06:50.120
imagery, and the symbol around him is like a
circular stained glass structure that spirals in

02:06:50.120 --> 02:06:52.552
with the actual star and the sun in the center.

02:06:52.552 --> 02:06:59.804
The music continues to grow louder and louder the
further in you walk, and you feel like you're

02:06:59.804 --> 02:07:06.001
being led along for a good 15 minutes straight.
This structure, this hallway, just goes on and on,

02:07:06.001 --> 02:07:12.047
the arches passing one after the other after the
other. Your eyes have adjusted to the brightness

02:07:12.047 --> 02:07:20.067
of the interior now. Eventually, you come to
another set of large doors. These doors

02:07:20.067 --> 02:07:30.650
themselves: no wood, no stone, just pure, vibrant
platinum and gold. The symbol upon them seems to

02:07:30.650 --> 02:07:36.490
be the same circular motif as the symbol of the
Dawnfather, with the star in the center, but the

02:07:36.490 --> 02:07:42.879
detail and intricacies. You get close, and your
eyes-- especially you, Vex and Vax-- you glance

02:07:42.879 --> 02:07:49.771
and you can see, on every small scale, even just a
simple bar of the star and the sun has writing,

02:07:49.771 --> 02:07:55.494
and has artwork, and then as you look closer, even
on a smaller scale, that writing is comprised of

02:07:55.494 --> 02:08:03.511
smaller artwork and smaller writing. You're thrown
off by the level of detail and intricacy of this

02:08:03.511 --> 02:08:11.681
place's construction. You're in awe. Your jaw
drops as these reveals seem to barrage you with

02:08:11.681 --> 02:08:14.015
each step into the structure.

02:08:14.015 --> 02:08:20.838
At that point, the doors (scraping noise) open,
and you wince once again, as the light that fills

02:08:20.838 --> 02:08:27.627
the room from the inside is near-blinding. You
close your eyes a bit, and all you hear is this

02:08:27.627 --> 02:08:31.310
deep, resonant voice say, "Come."

02:08:31.310 --> 02:08:37.402
LAURA: This has to be Heaven. The doors just keep opening.

02:08:37.402 --> 02:08:40.946
MARISHA: This must be the bright light that
everyone sees when they die.

02:08:40.988 --> 02:08:43.881
TRAVIS: Don't steal his doors, or anything.

02:08:43.881 --> 02:08:46.291
SAM: You want to steal the doors?

02:08:46.291 --> 02:08:49.270
TRAVIS: What a terrible thing to say in the
presence of the Dawnfather.

02:08:49.270 --> 02:08:52.047
LIAM: (muffled) All right, one foot in front of
the other. Here we go.

02:08:52.047 --> 02:08:54.368
SAM: Oh, we can't hear Liam.

02:08:54.368 --> 02:08:57.437
LIAM: "One foot in front of the other. Here we
go," I said.

02:08:57.437 --> 02:08:58.800
TALIESIN: Let's go.

02:08:58.800 --> 02:09:09.190
MATT: You shield your eyes, upon stepping into the
actual chamber, because otherwise, even closing

02:09:09.190 --> 02:09:15.332
your eyes isn't enough; the light is so intense.
It still hurts through your eyelids. As you step

02:09:15.332 --> 02:09:20.874
inside and look off, you can now glance around the
interior of this chamber. The same level of

02:09:20.874 --> 02:09:28.550
fractal-like scrolling detail you saw in the doors
lines every inch of the wall on the inside of this

02:09:28.550 --> 02:09:38.439
large, square chamber, hundreds of feet across on
each side. It's incredible. The floor is almost

02:09:38.439 --> 02:09:45.191
mirrored in its polish. Glancing down, while there
is no immediate shadow, behind you, the bright

02:09:45.191 --> 02:09:54.502
light does cast a bit behind you. You can see your
reflection almost perfectly in the polished floor

02:09:54.502 --> 02:09:55.801
below.

02:09:55.801 --> 02:10:03.255
You glance up, and you see the interior of that
giant steeple-like tower that's sat at the center

02:10:03.255 --> 02:10:09.421
of the fortress in the distance, and you look up
almost endlessly. You can see floor after floor

02:10:09.421 --> 02:10:22.252
with an endless spiral of various stained glass
structures and reliefs and small statues that

02:10:22.252 --> 02:10:32.233
protrude from the edges, and this tower is
seemingly hollow, just leading up, and you can't

02:10:32.233 --> 02:10:39.703
even make out the top of it from this distance. It
looks like a tower that is infinite, almost, from

02:10:39.703 --> 02:10:41.688
this perspective, it's so big.

02:10:41.688 --> 02:10:43.799
LAURA: Is the light coming from the tower?

02:10:43.799 --> 02:10:48.153
MATT: No, the light's coming from the center of
the room. As your eyes slowly adjust and you

02:10:48.153 --> 02:10:54.943
glance past your fingers and your hands, you see
there in the center of the chamber is a 25-foot

02:10:54.943 --> 02:11:08.086
throne of gold, brass, silver, and ruby. Sitting
upon that throne sits a mighty being, wearing the

02:11:08.086 --> 02:11:16.633
most intricate and beautiful golden plate armor
you've ever seen. Similar in detail and design as

02:11:16.633 --> 02:11:22.382
the interior of the chamber around you, it almost
blends in if you didn't see it shift. A white

02:11:22.382 --> 02:11:27.366
cloak encases the shoulders of this entity and
sways gently at their side like it's been brushed

02:11:27.366 --> 02:11:33.876
off and dangles over one of the arm rests. And
where a head would be, instead there is a burning

02:11:33.876 --> 02:11:39.633
star, so bright that you can only look but a
second before you have to avert your gaze and shut

02:11:39.633 --> 02:11:45.492
your lids out of the pain. Just enough time to
barely make out the outline of what appears to be

02:11:45.492 --> 02:11:55.616
a male head, almost featureless, burning within
the corona. This, you can only imagine, is the

02:11:55.616 --> 02:11:59.635
Dawnfather himself, Pelor.

02:11:59.635 --> 02:12:10.132
As you step into the chamber, the door (boom)
closes behind you, and the winged planar entities

02:12:10.132 --> 02:12:17.692
that pushed you in are not in the chamber. It's
just you... and the Dawnfather.

02:12:17.692 --> 02:12:20.765
SAM: Look how far we've come, guys.

02:12:20.765 --> 02:12:22.904
(laughter)

02:12:22.904 --> 02:12:25.765
SAM: From throwing shit at people...

02:12:25.765 --> 02:12:29.103
LAURA: Didn't you do that just last week?

02:12:29.103 --> 02:12:30.973
SAM: I did. I do that most weeks.

02:12:30.973 --> 02:12:32.575
LAURA: Grog--

02:12:32.575 --> 02:12:34.307
TRAVIS: Yes?

02:12:34.307 --> 02:12:38.212
LAURA: Next time we visit the Dawnfather, wear
some underwear. This floor is like a mirror.

02:12:38.212 --> 02:12:41.312
TRAVIS: But I don't ever-- oh, okay.

02:12:41.312 --> 02:12:43.192
TALIESIN: What are you-- oh god.

02:12:43.192 --> 02:12:48.263
SAM: Ooh! You mean I can-- oh, sorry.

02:12:48.263 --> 02:12:52.444
(laughter)

02:12:52.444 --> 02:12:53.773
MATT: "Vox Machina."

02:12:53.773 --> 02:12:55.508
TRAVIS: Oh shit.

02:12:55.508 --> 02:12:59.183
(laughter)

02:12:59.183 --> 02:13:02.064
TRAVIS: Little bit of pee comes out. A little
bit.

02:13:02.064 --> 02:13:04.385
MARISHA: You guys, he knows our name.

02:13:04.385 --> 02:13:12.743
MATT: "You come with purpose. I can sense your
determination. What would you tell me of your

02:13:12.743 --> 02:13:14.493
"purpose?"

02:13:14.493 --> 02:13:19.213
TALIESIN: Vecna walks the earth.

02:13:19.213 --> 02:13:23.610
MARISHA: We are here to prevent the coming of a
third Calamity.

02:13:23.610 --> 02:13:28.183
TRAVIS: We seek the means to destroy him and all
he stands for.

02:13:28.183 --> 02:13:31.673
MARISHA: He seeks ascension into godhood.

02:13:31.673 --> 02:13:40.204
LIAM: And all your children are in danger, and we
have begun communing with the gods. I extend

02:13:40.204 --> 02:13:45.249
slowly the wings and bow my head in deference to
him.

02:13:45.249 --> 02:13:59.717
TALIESIN: The Divergence is threatened. Your
guards, your creatures, have some of our proof in

02:13:59.717 --> 02:14:02.614
their care, at the moment.

02:14:02.614 --> 02:14:12.418
MATT: "Another seeks the path of the Matron of
Ravens. A flaw in our annihilation of her hubris.

02:14:12.418 --> 02:14:22.543
"That it still exists is dire news. That it exists
in the hands of such a slippery, vile mortal as

02:14:22.543 --> 02:14:36.409
"Vecna, even more so. I thank you for your haste in
sharing your findings. I shall ponder a strategy."

02:14:36.409 --> 02:14:43.689
He leans back in his chair, brushes his hand like
this, and the doors behind you (boom) open.

02:14:43.689 --> 02:15:04.755
LAURA: It was you that I was speaking to, in
Whitestone. I had no idea.

02:15:04.803 --> 02:15:07.248
We have the eye of Vecna.

02:15:07.248 --> 02:15:15.898
MATT: His form shifts a bit, seems to lean forward
on the throne, resting the bright, burning,

02:15:15.898 --> 02:15:22.265
star-like head on the edge of his gauntleted fist,
leaning forward in your direction. You try and

02:15:22.265 --> 02:15:28.690
glance up, but it hurts in the presence. "Present
the artifact."

02:15:28.690 --> 02:15:32.055
SAM: Well, we gave it to--

02:15:32.055 --> 02:15:33.643
LAURA: No, we still have it.

02:15:33.643 --> 02:15:34.724
SAM: Oh, we do?

02:15:34.724 --> 02:15:36.154
LAURA: Yeah, he kept it with us.

02:15:36.154 --> 02:15:38.545
ASHLEY: Oh, I have it, actually.

02:15:38.545 --> 02:15:43.155
SAM: Could you guys turn them up? We can't hear
them at all.

02:15:43.155 --> 02:15:45.015
LAURA: Please.

02:15:45.015 --> 02:15:47.970
MATT: So as you place the box on the ground--

02:15:47.970 --> 02:15:54.664
ASHLEY: I'll try to take it over-- I'm going to
leave it on the ground; it's a little hot over

02:15:54.664 --> 02:15:55.954
there.

02:15:55.954 --> 02:16:03.115
MATT: Okay. As you leave it on the ground, you
can't see his eyes, you can't see where he's

02:16:03.115 --> 02:16:08.935
facing necessarily, but you can sense his
attention; it's like a beacon across the room.

02:16:08.935 --> 02:16:13.725
It's ever-present, but there is definitely a focal
point that you can sense when it comes to you,

02:16:13.725 --> 02:16:19.354
it's like having a spotlight on you amongst a
theater of thousands of people. It's intimidating,

02:16:19.354 --> 02:16:28.504
but also exhilarating. The beacon shifts in the
direction of the small box you placed on the

02:16:28.504 --> 02:16:34.812
ground. Immediately the box flips open, and you
watch as the eye levitates out on its own,

02:16:34.812 --> 02:16:43.056
twitching and looking around in all directions. It
has no lid to close, and the tiny slit-like iris

02:16:43.056 --> 02:16:51.767
of it seems to retract best it can, in the
presence of such bright light. You hear this low,

02:16:51.767 --> 02:16:59.542
ruminating (hums). "Do you have purpose with
this?"

02:16:59.542 --> 02:17:04.076
SAM: Only if it can help us destroy Vecna.

02:17:04.076 --> 02:17:08.289
MATT: "Do you know how this would help you destroy
Vecna?"

02:17:08.289 --> 02:17:11.636
MARISHA: We don't know how to destroy Vecna.

02:17:11.636 --> 02:17:13.642
TALIESIN: We seek knowledge and power.

02:17:13.642 --> 02:17:15.607
MARISHA: And assistance.

02:17:15.607 --> 02:17:32.709
MATT: "I could destroy this right now, only if you
do not need it. Its existence is a threat. But the

02:17:32.709 --> 02:17:36.241
"choice is yours, since you brought it before me."

02:17:36.241 --> 02:17:42.146
LAURA: Do you know what help it would be to us on
the Material Plane?

02:17:42.146 --> 02:17:47.237
MATT: He stares through you. The beacon finds
you.

02:17:47.237 --> 02:17:52.877
MARISHA: It's not the only one in existence. There
are others.

02:17:52.877 --> 02:17:55.989
TALIESIN: I think it might be, yes.

02:17:55.989 --> 02:17:57.813
MARISHA: Right?

02:17:57.813 --> 02:18:00.544
LIAM: That's his eye.

02:18:00.544 --> 02:18:03.019
MATT: There are other people missing eyes, but
this is the only one--

02:18:03.019 --> 02:18:05.986
LIAM: It's his. And it should be destroyed.

02:18:05.986 --> 02:18:08.026
SAM: Right now?

02:18:08.026 --> 02:18:20.483
LAURA: Maybe it'll make him weaker, if it is
destroyed. He obviously put it in his scion. We

02:18:20.483 --> 02:18:25.449
destroy it, we keep someone else like Delilah
Briarwood from coming into power. Right?

02:18:25.449 --> 02:18:28.137
TALIESIN: Yes, I think...

02:18:28.137 --> 02:18:32.247
LAURA: I say destroy it.

02:18:32.247 --> 02:18:38.078
LIAM: Delilah was obviously his pawn and she was
using it. Fuck it. Destroy it.

02:18:38.078 --> 02:18:52.107
TALIESIN: We stand with... a master of the Grey
Hunt. She is the one who can speak for Whitestone

02:18:52.107 --> 02:18:55.640
on that level. If you say destroy it, we destroy
it.

02:18:55.640 --> 02:19:02.753
MATT: The beacon comes back to you again. The
stage beneath you, everyone around you, seems to

02:19:02.753 --> 02:19:10.712
vanish in the light that's the attention of this
entity, this god, ancient beyond all thought and

02:19:10.712 --> 02:19:14.877
reason that you would contemplate, awaiting your
answer.

02:19:14.877 --> 02:19:25.736
LAURA: You know so much more than we do. If you
believe it is unsafe, then we trust your wisdom in

02:19:25.736 --> 02:19:29.863
destroying it.

02:19:29.863 --> 02:19:36.813
MATT: "The wisdom of the creators is to instill
their creations with the choice of their own

02:19:36.813 --> 02:19:38.394
"destiny."

02:19:38.394 --> 02:19:43.657
LAURA: Then I say destroy it.

02:19:43.657 --> 02:19:45.594
MARISHA: What if we can--

02:19:45.594 --> 02:19:52.806
MATT: "The choice is made." And with that point
you watch as, without leaving attention from you,

02:19:52.806 --> 02:20:01.172
the eye begins to lift up out of the box once
more. The hand that was under the chin unfurls

02:20:01.172 --> 02:20:08.262
into a clasping set of fingers, and as they clench
together, you hear the metal clink and grind, and

02:20:08.262 --> 02:20:14.884
you watch as this light begins to flare around the
eye. And if you could hear a squeaking scream from

02:20:14.884 --> 02:20:23.081
a powerful artifact, you watch as it just burns in
a flash. And (shattering noise) the shattering

02:20:23.081 --> 02:20:28.092
sound echoes throughout the room. You see a burst
of greenish dark energy, and for a moment, the

02:20:28.092 --> 02:20:32.678
light in the room seems to dim, like a very faint,
almost brown-out.

02:20:32.678 --> 02:20:35.810
TRAVIS: (quietly) Shit.

02:20:35.810 --> 02:20:37.935
LIAM: Good.

02:20:37.935 --> 02:20:39.605
LAURA: I think that's a good thing.

02:20:39.605 --> 02:20:40.624
ASHLEY: I do, too.

02:20:40.624 --> 02:20:42.001
LIAM: It is a good thing.

02:20:42.001 --> 02:20:43.892
LAURA: Yes.

02:20:43.892 --> 02:20:50.430
LIAM: Vecna's a puppeteer. He used that to move
Delilah. It's gone.

02:20:50.430 --> 02:20:53.912
MATT: "Now, if you have no further business..."

02:20:53.912 --> 02:21:04.596
LAURA: We seek out the goddess Ioun, the goddess
of knowledge. The ritual of seeding was lost to

02:21:04.596 --> 02:21:12.223
time, and we know that the goddess Ioun is one of
the only keepers of that knowledge.

02:21:12.223 --> 02:21:36.554
MATT: There's a moment of contemplation on his
end. "She is safe. She recovers, hidden away. I

02:21:36.554 --> 02:21:48.523
"know elements of where she resides, but this
information only belongs to those trusted."

02:21:48.523 --> 02:22:06.723
MARISHA: We know you and her helped seal away the
chaos of these secrets before. We may need your

02:22:06.723 --> 02:22:12.080
help doing it again.

02:22:12.080 --> 02:22:17.281
MATT: He leans forward towards you, and you feel
the beacon of attention shift towards you this

02:22:17.281 --> 02:22:25.445
time. And you, Keyleth, who have spent most of
your life trying to dodge and dive from the

02:22:25.445 --> 02:22:34.922
attention of the masses, trying to buck the
destiny that has been thrust upon you since

02:22:34.922 --> 02:22:41.175
childhood, here in this moment, you have the
attention of one of the prime creator gods of

02:22:41.175 --> 02:22:53.209
Exandria, and you feel yourself weaken and
strengthen at the same time. You're not sure

02:22:53.209 --> 02:23:02.777
whether to run or stand, and the voice comes out
once more. "I have champions across all of

02:23:02.777 --> 02:23:13.432
"Exandria who have lived longer and proven
themselves worthy, capable. My consecrations are

02:23:13.432 --> 02:23:18.175
"taxing, and I will not have it wasted on those set
to fail."

02:23:18.175 --> 02:23:25.899
LAURA: How can we prove ourselves to you?

02:23:25.899 --> 02:23:37.473
MATT: "You have not one faithful among you, yet
you beseech my blessing."

02:23:37.473 --> 02:23:51.023
MARISHA: I could be your champion. You could teach
me to believe. I, arguably, am faithless. I know

02:23:51.023 --> 02:24:04.143
you all know that. I believe, and I have respect,
and I am awe-inspired by all of this. But faith, I

02:24:04.143 --> 02:24:12.350
still don't know if I have, but I... I believe you
could teach me.

02:24:12.350 --> 02:24:17.395
MATT: "Is there anyone else who would challenge
this proclamation?"

02:24:17.395 --> 02:24:29.909
LAURA: I don't want to challenge you, Keyleth.

02:24:29.909 --> 02:24:38.555
MARISHA: What? We already have one champion of the
Raven Queen. Why not?

02:24:38.555 --> 02:24:45.215
TALIESIN: Once, you blessed Whitestone.

02:24:45.215 --> 02:24:53.558
MATT: "Whitestone is under my watch and keep. It
was created through the battlefield in which I

02:24:53.558 --> 02:25:01.134
"sealed Tharizdun himself. It was the grounds in
which Ioun was wounded in the Calamity. There was

02:25:01.134 --> 02:25:06.791
"much sorrow in those lands. Yes, it is under my
watch."

02:25:06.791 --> 02:25:16.472
MARISHA: I'm friends with the Sun Tree. We talk
occasionally.

02:25:16.472 --> 02:25:30.255
MATT: "A faithless stands to try and accept the
champion's mantle. I ask once more, is there any

02:25:30.255 --> 02:25:33.783
"to challenge this claim?"

02:25:33.783 --> 02:25:45.928
LAURA: Keyleth... let me? I've never felt this
before.

02:25:45.928 --> 02:25:57.516
MARISHA: You are the lady of Whitestone. It suits
you.

02:25:57.516 --> 02:26:18.977
MATT: "Very well. You step forth with the growing
bud of faith. That befits the growth of a

02:26:18.977 --> 02:26:32.502
"champion. I will see you show me your quality.
You, as the vessel, kneel before me."

02:26:32.502 --> 02:26:37.709
LAURA: I kneel.

02:26:37.709 --> 02:26:43.345
MATT: He leans forward at the edge of the throne,
you hear the metal clinking as the plates shift

02:26:43.345 --> 02:26:50.913
and move. And you can hear now, at the proximity
as he leans down towards you, the faint flicker of

02:26:50.913 --> 02:26:58.629
the surface of the sun-like head that is the
beacon of the Dawnfather's face. "You would accept

02:26:58.629 --> 02:27:12.818
"my trial, brave soul? Then you and your allies
must ascend the Tower of the Zenith. The chosen

02:27:12.818 --> 02:27:27.818
"among you, Lady Vex'ahlia, you must reach the top
of the tower before this time runs thin." As he

02:27:27.818 --> 02:27:34.757
lifts his hand you watch, as apparating in the
air, a container of glass with sand across the

02:27:34.757 --> 02:27:43.358
top. He lifts his other hand. Another one appears.
And these two hourglasses now held aloft, gliding

02:27:43.358 --> 02:27:54.206
slowly above the space where you stand. "Ascend to
the zenith. Embrace your faith and throw yourself

02:27:54.206 --> 02:28:04.258
"in the Fires of Dawn. Should you be strong of
heart and your faith be true, the flames will

02:28:04.258 --> 02:28:06.357
"grant you my blessing."

02:28:06.357 --> 02:28:12.417
LAURA: Just me, or the group of us?

02:28:12.417 --> 02:28:24.487
MATT: "You must jump into the flames. They can
help you ascend. However, your trial begins now."

02:28:24.487 --> 02:28:34.675
And you watch as one of the glasses suddenly
shifts, and three of the winged planars appear in

02:28:34.675 --> 02:28:40.437
the room, armored around you, arms crossed, and
they look to be trying to block the passage into

02:28:40.437 --> 02:28:47.087
the tower as they fly up. You look up to the
seemingly endless beacon above you, to the top of

02:28:47.087 --> 02:28:52.905
the tower that you cannot see at this distance,
and you know immediately, somehow, quickly, you

02:28:52.905 --> 02:28:57.597
have to get there. So. What are you doing?

02:28:57.597 --> 02:28:58.830
TRAVIS: Oh god!

02:28:58.830 --> 02:29:02.213
MARISHA: I. Hate. Timed. Challenges.

02:29:02.213 --> 02:29:06.946
LAURA: Well, I've got the boots, but I-- okay, I'm
going, I take off.

02:29:06.946 --> 02:29:08.541
SAM: Wait!

02:29:08.541 --> 02:29:09.895
LIAM: Click your Boots of Haste.

02:29:09.895 --> 02:29:12.629
SAM: I'm going to to turn her into a red dragon.

02:29:12.629 --> 02:29:15.007
TRAVIS: Do you want that?

02:29:15.007 --> 02:29:18.797
LAURA: Sure. I click my Boots of Haste before he
does it.

02:29:18.797 --> 02:29:23.089
MATT: Okay, so you click your Boots of Haste. They
come into you, you feel the surge of energy, the

02:29:23.089 --> 02:29:27.330
rush, the burst of adrenaline through your body,
as you begin casting?

02:29:27.330 --> 02:29:29.856
SAM: True Polymorph.

02:29:29.856 --> 02:29:33.376
LAURA: Oh my god. Does that ever end? Do you have
to cancel it?

02:29:33.376 --> 02:29:34.558
SAM: Yes.

02:29:34.558 --> 02:29:39.646
MATT: All right, so as you begin to ascend, you
watch as the three planar begin to rush towards

02:29:39.646 --> 02:29:42.129
you, their arms out to grasp. Anyone else going to
do anything?

02:29:42.129 --> 02:29:45.152
TRAVIS: Yeah, I would like to smash my gauntlets
together and cast Enlarge.

02:29:45.152 --> 02:29:47.536
MATT: All right, so you go into your larger form
now.

02:29:47.536 --> 02:29:49.868
TRAVIS: And rage. I'll charge one of them.

02:29:49.868 --> 02:29:51.984
MATT: They're up in the air. She's flying up.

02:29:51.984 --> 02:29:53.373
TALIESIN: You've got the carpet.

02:29:53.373 --> 02:29:55.542
TRAVIS: And I pull the carpet out.

02:29:55.542 --> 02:29:58.114
MATT: Okay.

02:29:58.114 --> 02:30:02.918
TALIESIN: I click my Boots of Spider Climbing and
spend an action surge to draw and start taking

02:30:02.918 --> 02:30:05.998
shots at the wings. I want to drop them out of the
air.

02:30:05.998 --> 02:30:12.300
MATT: Okay, go for it, make three shots. Very
quickly. As you're ascending on the broom as

02:30:12.300 --> 02:30:16.053
quickly as possible, and they begin to converge on
you, you feel this tickle of energy in the back of

02:30:16.053 --> 02:30:22.216
your mind and you watch as your hands begin to
suddenly grow claws and scales, a red color.

02:30:22.216 --> 02:30:27.678
TRAVIS: Vax! Do something!

02:30:27.678 --> 02:30:30.586
LIAM: I cast Shield of Faith on my own ass.

02:30:30.586 --> 02:30:33.130
MATT: Okay. Shield of Faith cast on Vax.

02:30:33.130 --> 02:30:34.906
LAURA: Can everybody fly?

02:30:34.906 --> 02:30:36.739
TALIESIN: I'm running up the wall.

02:30:36.739 --> 02:30:39.641
LAURA: Before I Polymorph, I toss you my broom.

02:30:39.641 --> 02:30:41.639
SAM: Are you going to allow that?

02:30:41.639 --> 02:30:47.019
MATT: Sure. So you throw the broom off the side,
and you begin to plummet immediately through the

02:30:47.345 --> 02:30:51.814
air. As you're concentrating on the spell to cast
it, you finish it off, and you plummet back about

02:30:52.123 --> 02:30:56.082
half the distance, and then (whoosh) these giant
leathery red dragon wings whip out of your form,

02:30:56.082 --> 02:31:01.929
and you catch yourself. The broom clatters to the
ground, and Scanlan marches over and grabs it,

02:31:01.929 --> 02:31:03.801
manages to get it under his grasp.

02:31:03.801 --> 02:31:06.681
LAURA: You know that word!

02:31:06.681 --> 02:31:10.225
MATT: All righty. So you begin to ascend upward,
right as they begin to descend on your dragon

02:31:10.225 --> 02:31:11.473
form.

02:31:11.473 --> 02:31:13.398
TALIESIN: 20, 24, and 36.

02:31:13.398 --> 02:31:15.912
MATT: 20, 24, and 36, they all hit!

02:31:15.912 --> 02:31:21.722
TALIESIN: That's a strength saving throw, or they
fall a little bit.

02:31:21.722 --> 02:31:23.896
MATT: Strength saving throw, all right, that is an
18?

02:31:23.896 --> 02:31:26.056
TALIESIN: Nope. They fall.

02:31:26.056 --> 02:31:27.226
MATT: 21?

02:31:27.226 --> 02:31:28.393
TALIESIN: That's okay.

02:31:28.393 --> 02:31:32.731
MATT: And a 12. So two of them. You shoot two of
the wings out of the way and they plummet down,

02:31:32.731 --> 02:31:38.180
and you manage to coast past two of them in your
dragon form. One of them does manage to grab onto

02:31:38.180 --> 02:31:43.024
you and get its hands, big strong hands on the
back of your head and try and steer you to the

02:31:43.024 --> 02:31:44.101
side.

02:31:44.101 --> 02:31:46.090
LAURA: Can I cast Frightful Presence?

02:31:46.090 --> 02:31:53.560
MATT: We'll get to that in just a moment. It's
going to attempt to-- no. It tries to pull against

02:31:53.560 --> 02:31:59.684
you, but even with its extremely strong planar
strength it cannot guide you away from the path,

02:31:59.684 --> 02:32:03.796
and you push past. You are now outside of the
chamber in the base of the tower, just flying

02:32:03.796 --> 02:32:07.937
upward. You can go ahead and use your Frightful
Presence. All right, so that's your action.

02:32:07.937 --> 02:32:12.907
LAURA: All of the creatures-- no, of my choosing,
so all the bad-- not bad guys, but you know,

02:32:12.907 --> 02:32:14.488
people we're fighting.

02:32:14.488 --> 02:32:20.483
MATT: As you roar loudly and it echoes, filling
the entirety of the chamber, the music of the

02:32:20.483 --> 02:32:26.149
surroundings now merging and shifting with this
horrible dragon roar. None of these angelic

02:32:26.149 --> 02:32:28.308
entities seem even remotely affected by it.

02:32:28.308 --> 02:32:30.780
LAURA: Oh, really? They don't even have to make a
wisdom saving throw?

02:32:30.780 --> 02:32:33.611
MATT: They are immune to fear. Or being
frightened, sorry.

02:32:33.611 --> 02:32:34.920
LAURA: That makes sense.

02:32:34.920 --> 02:32:40.085
MATT: But do you continue flying upward? Okay! So
you finish your spell, you take your shots,

02:32:40.085 --> 02:32:42.565
Keyleth, Pike, anything?

02:32:42.565 --> 02:32:47.594
ASHLEY: Am I close enough to Grog to hop onto the
carpet, as well?

02:32:47.594 --> 02:32:50.843
MATT: Okay, so Pike and Grog get onto the carpet.
Keyleth, what are you doing?

02:32:50.843 --> 02:32:54.444
MARISHA: Are people clustered up together by now?

02:32:54.444 --> 02:32:58.656
LAURA: Do I take the alignment of the animal that
I'm polymorphed into?

02:32:58.656 --> 02:33:00.838
MATT: Not the alignment, just your mental scores.

02:33:00.838 --> 02:33:06.238
MARISHA: Are people super clustered, or is she now
clustered with them?

02:33:06.238 --> 02:33:10.022
MATT: No, she's above everybody. She's way past
all you guys; she shot straight up.

02:33:10.022 --> 02:33:12.848
MARISHA: So the angel dudes are all clustered
together?

02:33:12.848 --> 02:33:19.919
MATT: Two of them fell a little bit, one of them's
on her back. She's making her way up, guys. The

02:33:19.919 --> 02:33:22.267
first stained glass is starting to run out.

02:33:22.267 --> 02:33:27.682
MARISHA: Throw up a big level five Flaming Sphere.
Ah, wait can I do a, with my spear can I do a

02:33:27.682 --> 02:33:35.092
higher-level Fireball? And just do more charges
out of it? Or no?

02:33:35.092 --> 02:33:38.565
MATT: I'll say no because you can't spend more
charges to increase the level of the spell.

02:33:38.565 --> 02:33:43.068
MARISHA: Then I will do a 5th-level Flaming
Sphere.

02:33:43.068 --> 02:33:53.025
MATT: Okay, so the Flaming Sphere slams upward
against the side there. Saving throw. Rolls a one

02:33:53.025 --> 02:33:55.765
on saving throw. So it takes damage. Flaming spear
hits it, however--

02:33:55.765 --> 02:33:57.178
MARISHA: It doesn't hit both of them?

02:33:57.178 --> 02:34:02.769
MATT: No, you can slam it into one creature per
turn. The one that's on her back, you mean? What's

02:34:02.769 --> 02:34:05.405
the range on the flaming sphere?

02:34:05.405 --> 02:34:07.593
LAURA: Come on, the time is running out!

02:34:07.593 --> 02:34:10.484
MATT: No time for a book. Never mind; it doesn't
matter. The flaming sphere slams into one of the

02:34:10.484 --> 02:34:14.256
ones that's not on her back. It's too far out of
your range. &nbsp;All right, so. Who's doing what

02:34:14.256 --> 02:34:15.427
next?

02:34:15.427 --> 02:34:17.126
TRAVIS: We're rocketing up on the rug.

02:34:17.126 --> 02:34:20.414
MATT: Okay, the rug, not very fast, and her speed
is much faster as a dragon, so you guys are coming

02:34:20.414 --> 02:34:22.671
up behind and you're just watching the dragon
(flapping).

02:34:22.671 --> 02:34:24.965
TRAVIS: Are we close to any of the other two that
are at the bottom?

02:34:24.965 --> 02:34:30.905
MATT: No, but as soon as that timer went out, the
chamber's roof above you slams shut. You're all

02:34:30.905 --> 02:34:32.635
cut off from Vex.

02:34:32.635 --> 02:34:35.124
TALIESIN: I was running up the wall. I didn't make
it in time?

02:34:35.124 --> 02:34:37.024
MATT: Not at your speed, no. It's a big chamber.

02:34:37.024 --> 02:34:44.625
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to haste, as fast as I can.
When I clicked my boots, do I still get a hasted

02:34:44.625 --> 02:34:45.535
action?

02:34:45.535 --> 02:34:46.506
MATT: Yes, you do.

02:34:46.506 --> 02:34:48.537
LAURA: Okay, cool, then I can go 160 feet.

02:34:48.537 --> 02:34:52.340
MATT: Yes, you can. The planar is still holding on
to the back of your head, it's going to make

02:34:52.340 --> 02:34:54.344
another strength check.

02:34:54.344 --> 02:34:57.018
LAURA: I'm going to try to tail whip him. Is that
a thing I can do?

02:34:57.018 --> 02:34:58.619
MATT: Make an athletics check.

02:34:58.619 --> 02:35:04.014
LAURA: Okay. Oh, I have a red dice, it's so
perfect and I never choose this one.

02:35:04.014 --> 02:35:05.617
MATT: What did you roll?

02:35:05.617 --> 02:35:09.053
LAURA: Oh, okay, well. What am I adding to it?

02:35:09.053 --> 02:35:12.317
MATT: Add your strength modifier. If there isn't
an athletics score, then whatever your strength

02:35:12.317 --> 02:35:13.889
modifier is.

02:35:13.889 --> 02:35:15.889
LAURA: That would be plus five?

02:35:15.889 --> 02:35:18.028
SAM: Are you talking about hers or the dragon's?

02:35:18.028 --> 02:35:19.947
LAURA: Oh, a plus seven. So 13.

02:35:19.947 --> 02:35:24.508
MATT: 13. The planar grabs one side of your horn
and causes you to slam into the side of the tower,

02:35:24.508 --> 02:35:30.677
and you skid across and smash into one of the
stained glass windows which (smash) fires out the

02:35:30.677 --> 02:35:35.208
side and you end up slowing down a bit and it
actually takes you a moment, it halves your speed

02:35:35.208 --> 02:35:39.379
for this round. You try and get your wings back
up. Are you going to do anything about the guy on

02:35:39.379 --> 02:35:41.559
your back or are you going to keep plugging as
fast as you can upwards?

02:35:41.559 --> 02:35:44.357
LAURA: He's on my back, or he's like hanging onto
me?

02:35:44.357 --> 02:35:47.931
MATT: He's on your neck and head. He's holding on
and trying to steer you off to the side by

02:35:47.931 --> 02:35:49.348
controlling your movement.

02:35:49.348 --> 02:35:53.890
LAURA: I'm going to spin and try to slam into the
wall and knock him into the stone.

02:35:53.890 --> 02:35:56.711
SAM: Can she do like a wing thing?

02:35:56.711 --> 02:36:00.620
LAURA: Yeah, I'm going to use my wings to thrust
me faster into the wall.

02:36:00.620 --> 02:36:03.890
MATT: Okay, go ahead and make an athletics check.

02:36:03.890 --> 02:36:09.869
LAURA: No, no. Okay. Athletics check, was a plus
seven, so 19.

02:36:09.869 --> 02:36:15.638
MATT: 19? 17. so you slam into the wall and you
hear (groans) behind you. The stained glass that

02:36:15.638 --> 02:36:20.833
shattered, reforms right where you left it, and
you continue to ascend upwards. Still holding onto

02:36:20.833 --> 02:36:25.329
you, but it's now disadvantaged on its next roll
because you slammed it into the wall. So

02:36:25.329 --> 02:36:29.873
(flapping) making your ascent upward as fast as
you can, you watch as the tower slowly pincers

02:36:29.873 --> 02:36:35.989
closer and closer. You watch as another layer
begins to close above. All right. He's going to

02:36:35.989 --> 02:36:40.039
attempt to try and slam you into the wall again.
Go ahead and make another athletics check. Roll a

02:36:40.039 --> 02:36:42.502
d20 and add your strength modifier. Go for it.

02:36:42.502 --> 02:36:43.953
LAURA: Okay. That one didn't count.

02:36:43.953 --> 02:36:45.578
MATT: You didn't intend to roll it.

02:36:45.578 --> 02:36:47.379
LAURA: Okay. Ooh, okay, 21.

02:36:47.379 --> 02:36:51.386
MATT: Yeah, you beat him. He tries to pull you off
to the side and you begin to skid into it. Your

02:36:51.386 --> 02:36:54.568
wing hits the side of the tower (scraping noise),
but you keep pushing forward. The pain hits you,

02:36:54.568 --> 02:36:58.689
you end up taking about 25 points of damage, just
grinding into this divine golden side but you keep

02:36:58.689 --> 02:37:04.244
flying up (flapping) the tower gets tighter and
tighter and tighter. You now can see as the planar

02:37:04.244 --> 02:37:08.123
is going to attempt to--

02:37:08.123 --> 02:37:09.478
LAURA: Wait, can I--

02:37:09.478 --> 02:37:11.410
MATT: What are you going to do?

02:37:11.410 --> 02:37:16.289
LAURA: Is he hanging onto me with one arm now?
What is he doing, because I knocked him into the

02:37:16.289 --> 02:37:17.379
wall, right?

02:37:17.379 --> 02:37:19.682
MATT: Yeah. What are you doing?

02:37:19.682 --> 02:37:23.656
LAURA: I'm going to just dash. I'm going to fuck
him and just dash.

02:37:23.656 --> 02:37:25.591
MATT: You're going to go double speed, all right.

02:37:25.591 --> 02:37:26.964
LAURA: Double speed!

02:37:26.964 --> 02:37:32.921
MATT: You shoot up. That gives him a full round to
go ahead and try and scare you off. Roll again with

02:37:32.921 --> 02:37:36.829
your strength.

02:37:36.829 --> 02:37:39.259
LAURA: 15.

02:37:39.259 --> 02:37:43.351
MATT: (crash) Slams you into the wall. You skid
and slow down a little bit. You can see it's

02:37:43.351 --> 02:37:47.000
closing. But you are dashing so you get a second
speed run, which does get you up towards where the

02:37:47.000 --> 02:37:50.173
wall's closing now. You can see now the bright
light is getting brighter and brighter. Your eyes

02:37:50.173 --> 02:37:53.582
are hurting in its presence, you can see a
large brazier at the top of the tower that is now

02:37:53.582 --> 02:37:58.441
in flames, before you. You're not quite there; you
have one more round. He's going to go ahead and

02:37:58.441 --> 02:38:01.879
now turn around, and now the angel turns around on
your face. He is going to attempt to punch in your

02:38:01.879 --> 02:38:02.999
eyes.

02:38:02.999 --> 02:38:04.989
SAM: Do you have legendary--

02:38:04.989 --> 02:38:07.369
LAURA: I'm going to use my legendary resistance.

02:38:07.369 --> 02:38:11.466
MATT: Well, it's a physical attack on you. What's
your AC?

02:38:11.466 --> 02:38:15.010
LAURA: 19. Natural.

02:38:15.010 --> 02:38:17.537
MATT: Yeah, it hits you, you take disadvantage on
your next strike. Go ahead and roll an athletics

02:38:17.537 --> 02:38:20.958
check to try and buck him off. One last time, this
is the only one you have time for. Disadvantage

02:38:20.958 --> 02:38:22.907
because he punched you in the face.

02:38:22.949 --> 02:38:25.626
LAURA: Okay, 14.

02:38:25.626 --> 02:38:28.531
MATT: 14, all right, you're slowing down, you're
slowing down, you're not quite getting there, he's

02:38:28.531 --> 02:38:29.930
bashing you in the face--

02:38:29.930 --> 02:38:31.710
LAURA: I'm going to take my claws up and rake
him!

02:38:31.710 --> 02:38:35.381
MATT: Okay, make another strength check.

02:38:35.381 --> 02:38:36.858
LAURA: What is it, 18!

02:38:36.858 --> 02:38:41.726
MATT: 11! You thrust him off your face! As he
falls off down below, (flapping) you make it up to

02:38:41.726 --> 02:38:46.479
the top, and you now see the brazier is about the
size of your dragon form. It's physically your

02:38:46.479 --> 02:38:50.010
size and you can see now the tower's beginning to
close around you, what are you going to do?

02:38:50.010 --> 02:38:52.512
LAURA: I'm going to reach the tower thing and push
myself up through.

02:38:52.512 --> 02:38:55.822
MATT: Okay, you pull your way up to the top, and
now you're right above the brazier and the flames.

02:38:55.822 --> 02:38:58.650
You look down into the brazier, the fire there
burning is ever-present light--

02:38:58.650 --> 02:39:00.200
LAURA: I rush into the fire!

02:39:00.200 --> 02:39:04.487
MATT: You dive into the fire. Your dragon form.
which resists it at that point, it immerses your

02:39:04.487 --> 02:39:09.875
entire form, at which point you hear the tower,
guys, above you crack and you hear this echoing

02:39:09.875 --> 02:39:17.131
(smash) sound, of what sounds like shattering of a
thousand windows at once. You, as you dive into

02:39:17.131 --> 02:39:26.274
the flames, feel this moment of searing bright
pain in your eyes, in your mind. Your dragon form

02:39:26.274 --> 02:39:35.561
is immune to flames, but your form suddenly
shrinks, the spell dispelled, the dragonoid form

02:39:35.561 --> 02:39:50.491
cast away. You sense this kind of lost nothing; your whole
body is numb at this point, and you are just

02:39:50.491 --> 02:39:56.669
surrounded by a white light. Much like where Vax,
in the plane in his communion with the Raven

02:39:56.669 --> 02:40:05.282
Queen is shrouded in darkness, this is endless,
every color. You have no sense of personal form.

02:40:05.333 --> 02:40:13.003
You have no sense of time, place, and for the
first time in a long time, you don't remember your

02:40:13.003 --> 02:40:22.490
name. For a brief instant, you think, what bit of
conscious thought you can make, is this is what

02:40:22.490 --> 02:40:33.547
oblivion feels like? Did you make the right
choice? Were you led astray? Were you strong of

02:40:33.547 --> 02:40:48.953
heart enough? The flames were intended to cleanse
away sin, darkness, possibly those who are

02:40:48.953 --> 02:41:05.701
unworthy. Is this it now? Did you fail?

02:41:05.701 --> 02:41:14.241
You guys down below watch as the chamber doors
that closed off above you (scraping noise) open up

02:41:14.241 --> 02:41:22.578
again to reveal the tower. And you can see there,
suspended in the middle of the air, thousands of

02:41:22.578 --> 02:41:32.042
shards of stained glass that had shattered inwards
from the impact but frozen, held in place. As they

02:41:32.042 --> 02:41:39.683
all slowly retract back, reforming the windows
that were once there. Whatever impact or shock

02:41:39.683 --> 02:41:48.933
wave had scattered them below reversed and
repaired. And you watch as they do so, ascending,

02:41:48.933 --> 02:42:01.182
until the tower's back untouched as it was. The
one planar that had ridden the dragon form of Vex

02:42:01.182 --> 02:42:09.840
towards the top of the tower slowly descends
(flapping) and lands next to the three others. And

02:42:09.840 --> 02:42:16.821
they all give a nod towards the Dawnfather, who's
still there, not looking upward, just looking at the

02:42:16.821 --> 02:42:22.902
rest of the remaining members of Vox Machina, his
beacon of attention just shifting from one to the

02:42:22.902 --> 02:42:44.713
other. The three planars leave the still-open
doors. "What does she mean to you?"

02:42:44.713 --> 02:42:47.611
SAM: To us? Oh god.

02:42:47.611 --> 02:42:55.447
MATT: "To you, all of you."

02:42:55.447 --> 02:43:11.193
MARISHA: I told you that I was faithless, which
might be true when it comes to the gods, but not

02:43:11.193 --> 02:43:33.011
with Vex'ahlia, not with Vox Machina. She gives me
my power.

02:43:33.011 --> 02:43:59.252
SAM: Her name is Vex, and she is greedy and mean
sometimes, and she can steal a lot. She's a little

02:43:59.252 --> 02:44:12.352
bit not the greatest person, but her flaws
highlight everything that is right about her,

02:44:12.352 --> 02:44:21.502
which is she does all these things to protect her
friends and her family. She would give her life

02:44:21.502 --> 02:44:36.982
for any of us and for anyone who was truly in
need. And she's not perfect, but she's the most

02:44:36.982 --> 02:44:42.268
perfect of all of us.

02:44:42.268 --> 02:44:50.909
TRAVIS: She believes in me. She tries to teach me
to use my brain, which I don't do very often. She

02:44:50.909 --> 02:44:57.230
tries to teach me to learn from the world. And she
always cheers me on, which not a lot of people do.

02:44:57.230 --> 02:45:02.033
I believe in her.

02:45:02.033 --> 02:45:08.272
MATT: The beacon shifts to you, Pike.

02:45:08.272 --> 02:45:24.045
PIKE: I don't have a real sister, but I consider
her more of my sister than I've ever had. She's

02:45:24.045 --> 02:45:39.811
family, and if you take her from me, there will be
hell to pay.

02:45:39.811 --> 02:45:45.232
MATT: The beacon shifts to Percival.

02:45:45.232 --> 02:45:57.799
PERCY: She is Mistress of the Grey Hunt of
Whitestone, Baroness of the First House of

02:45:57.799 --> 02:46:11.111
Whitestone. She is my heart and my judgment and
the future that I have chosen, and she is the one

02:46:11.111 --> 02:46:16.796
that I have betrothed to.

02:46:16.796 --> 02:46:24.255
SAM: What? Betrothed?

02:46:24.255 --> 02:46:34.463
MATT: The beacon shifts back to Vax.

02:46:34.463 --> 02:46:47.454
LIAM: She is every hope I have. When I am gone,
she will make the world right. She has the

02:46:47.454 --> 02:46:57.124
intelligence and the savviness and the heart to
make real-world decisions. She is me, but better.

02:46:57.124 --> 02:47:12.764
She is your champion.

02:47:12.764 --> 02:47:19.360
MATT: "Then there is hope." And you watch as in the
center of the chamber, a second star seems to be

02:47:19.400 --> 02:47:27.003
birthed before you, this bright point of light that begins to
swell in equal intensity as the head of the

02:47:27.003 --> 02:47:32.037
Dawnfather himself, as a flash consumes the
chamber, and there before you, you see, now

02:47:32.037 --> 02:47:43.257
reborn, hair scattered back, intact, slowly
descending, eyes closed, consciousness not yet

02:47:43.257 --> 02:47:53.350
drawn from within: Vex'ahlia. As her feet touch
the ground and she falls to her knees, she

02:47:53.350 --> 02:47:57.867
breathes in.

02:47:57.867 --> 02:48:11.616
Your eyes open. You look around and see the faces
of your friends, your family. And you're

02:48:11.616 --> 02:48:18.049
immediately aware of the presence of the entity
behind you. As you spin and look, whereas there once

02:48:18.049 --> 02:48:28.606
was a burning star-- and to the rest of you, you
see the painful, endless light that averts your

02:48:28.606 --> 02:48:39.198
gaze-- it doesn't hurt your eyes as much, and you
can see the faint features, the soft cheeks, the

02:48:39.198 --> 02:48:50.146
hairless head, and the bright warm eyes of he who
brings the dawn. And you can see the smile there,

02:48:50.146 --> 02:49:04.661
behind the light. "There is hope."

02:49:04.661 --> 02:49:07.180
Get your blessing of the Dawnfather.

02:49:07.180 --> 02:49:09.911
(gasping and cheering)

02:49:09.911 --> 02:49:12.109
TRAVIS: Holy shit, Super Saiyan.

02:49:12.109 --> 02:49:15.348
LAURA: What did I get? What is it?

02:49:15.348 --> 02:49:18.078
MATT: You naturally have resistance to necrotic
damage.

02:49:18.078 --> 02:49:22.348
LAURA: That's good for me. That fucking Finger of
Death.

02:49:22.348 --> 02:49:24.938
MATT: And if you want to read the rest of that,
you can.

02:49:24.938 --> 02:49:32.030
LAURA: As a bonus action, you channel the light of
day into your being. For one hour you admit,

02:49:32.030 --> 02:49:38.197
emit-- fuck me running, you emit bright light in a
120-foot radius, and any evil creature within that

02:49:38.197 --> 02:49:45.247
120-foot radius that hits you with an attack or
spell immediately suffers 4d6 radiant damage and

02:49:45.247 --> 02:49:46.838
is knocked prone.

02:49:46.838 --> 02:49:50.229
MARISHA: Wow! You're a walking nuke!

02:49:50.229 --> 02:49:52.411
LIAM: Shine bright like a diamond.

02:49:52.411 --> 02:49:56.504
LAURA: (laughs) Once this blessing ability is
used, it can't be used again for seven days.

02:49:56.504 --> 02:49:58.230
ASHLEY: Yeah!

02:49:58.230 --> 02:49:59.866
LAURA: Holy moly.

02:49:59.866 --> 02:50:03.109
ASHLEY: Blessings of the gods!

02:50:03.109 --> 02:50:07.711
TALIESIN: We'll have to add a sixth star to the de
Rolo crest. Fucking excited.

02:50:07.711 --> 02:50:20.673
LAURA: Thank you. Thank you for allowing me to
represent you.

02:50:20.673 --> 02:50:34.567
MATT: "If what you say is true, then we are too
late to prevent his ascension. Know that killing a

02:50:34.567 --> 02:50:44.673
"god is beyond even most deities. To destroy is to
diminish one low enough to seal them away for

02:50:44.673 --> 02:50:53.701
"eternity, as I have done once before. Such a
technique I used to banish the Chained Oblivion

02:50:53.701 --> 02:51:06.007
"once, after it nearly slew the Knowing Mistress.
Having brought it low in battle, Ioun had devised

02:51:06.007 --> 02:51:10.250
"something she called the Prime Trammel."

02:51:10.250 --> 02:51:17.072
SAM: The Prime Trammel.

02:51:17.072 --> 02:51:31.582
MATT: "Guided by a sizable sliver of a god's
power, one such device could be formed, and when

02:51:31.582 --> 02:51:41.255
"enough are affixed to a wounded god, seal them
away in a plane beyond the Astral Sea. Such a

02:51:41.255 --> 02:51:47.121
"method could perhaps force a new god back through
the Divine Gate and beyond the reach of your

02:51:47.121 --> 02:52:01.523
"world. Ioun, however, the one who has the design
for such an artifact-- she has been in hiding

02:52:01.523 --> 02:52:11.568
"since her wounding. She heals still, the wounded
god, and has feared for the past eight centuries

02:52:11.568 --> 02:52:21.241
"that her enemies seek to finish the job. We
communicate on occasion through missives and

02:52:21.241 --> 02:52:36.601
"emissaries. All that I know is the key to her
hidden realm is within someone. The last word from

02:52:36.601 --> 02:52:44.219
"the mistress from nearly a century before granted
me this." The gauntleted hand extends and opens,

02:52:44.219 --> 02:52:51.090
and there you see, apparating in the space above,
what appears to be a three-dimensional

02:52:51.090 --> 02:52:59.565
topographical map of some kind. It slowly rotates,
made of pure sunlight and flame. It's a mountain

02:52:59.565 --> 02:53:11.058
range with a glowing light within a small, hidden
house or hovel within a forest. Make an

02:53:11.058 --> 02:53:21.736
investigation check. I would say Keyleth,
Vex'ahlia, Vax'ildan, and Scanlan.

02:53:21.736 --> 02:53:23.892
SAM: Natural 20.

02:53:23.892 --> 02:53:27.611
LAURA: Oh, good, thank god. Because mine sucked.

02:53:27.611 --> 02:53:29.382
MARISHA: Also a natural 20.

02:53:29.382 --> 02:53:32.961
SAM: It's a real good map.

02:53:32.961 --> 02:53:36.749
MATT: Yeah. What did you get, Vax?

02:53:36.749 --> 02:53:38.699
LIAM: Not a natural 20.

02:53:38.699 --> 02:53:48.192
MATT: Okay. Glancing at it, both of you recognize,
as it pulls back and shifts inward, this is deep

02:53:48.192 --> 02:53:54.767
within the Cliffkeep. This is far north of
Kraghammer. This is in a forested region outside

02:53:54.767 --> 02:53:56.500
the Pools of Wittebak.

02:53:56.500 --> 02:54:00.691
MARISHA: Pools of Wittebak?

02:54:00.691 --> 02:54:13.432
MATT: Wittebak. Once a gnomish home, it befell to
a terrible natural occurrence sparked by unnatural

02:54:13.432 --> 02:54:21.872
means, and since has become a series of acidic and
toxic natural liquids and waters that burble up

02:54:21.872 --> 02:54:29.348
from beneath the earth, and many wandering giants
and larger ogrish folk use to their heart's

02:54:29.348 --> 02:54:36.330
content. But it's not in the Pools of Wittebak,
just near it, this strange hovel. The voice of the

02:54:36.330 --> 02:54:43.372
Dawnfather burns forth once more, the heavy
resonance shaking the room. "If you seek to devise

02:54:43.372 --> 02:54:52.158
"these Prime Trammels, then take this stone, my
champion. It should be enough essence for one of

02:54:52.158 --> 02:54:59.742
"them." You watch as he reaches up into the halo,
the corona of light around the head, and plucks

02:54:59.742 --> 02:55:08.447
from behind an ear a small bead of extremely
bright light. As he pulls it from his head, you

02:55:08.447 --> 02:55:17.083
watch the strength and intensity of his glow ever
so faintly diminish, and places it in your hand.

02:55:17.083 --> 02:55:23.050
As soon as it releases from the gauntleted
fingers-- so massive, each finger is as thick as

02:55:23.050 --> 02:55:31.765
your torso, it plops into your palm, and the glow
fades, and there before you, you see what looks to

02:55:31.765 --> 02:55:35.113
be some sort of an oval-like opal.

02:55:35.113 --> 02:55:37.242
LAURA: I love opals.

02:55:37.242 --> 02:55:52.165
MATT: "Now, I have invested what I can safely do
within you. Go. Be swift. Find this key. Strike

02:55:52.165 --> 02:56:05.592
"soon. Destroy or seal this great evil and prove my
faith in you is not misplaced, Vex'ahlia."

02:56:05.592 --> 02:56:09.862
LAURA: It won't be.

02:56:09.862 --> 02:56:17.473
MATT: The doors behind you that are already
partially ajar (rumble) open up all the way.

02:56:17.473 --> 02:56:26.715
LAURA: I guess I'll put this in a really safe
pocket, then. There's one that's got an extra

02:56:26.715 --> 02:56:30.922
snap. Triple snap and then a zipper over it.

02:56:30.922 --> 02:56:34.169
MARISHA: Just don't let it fall in the toilet when
you go over to flush.

02:56:34.169 --> 02:56:37.603
TRAVIS: I take out the little pebble and I drop it
on the floor.

02:56:37.603 --> 02:56:40.712
MATT: You reach for the pebble. It's not there.

02:56:40.712 --> 02:56:46.307
TRAVIS: Shit. Is there a hole in it? No?

02:56:46.307 --> 02:56:52.016
MATT: No hole. Sarenrae was not going to teleport
you across the realm, letting you take away one of

02:56:52.016 --> 02:56:54.969
the prized souls of her people.

02:56:54.969 --> 02:56:56.687
TRAVIS: Oh, those were the souls!

02:56:56.687 --> 02:56:59.694
LIAM: That was the pope, Travis. That was the
pope.

02:56:59.694 --> 02:57:02.157
TRAVIS: Should've swallowed the rock.

02:57:02.157 --> 02:57:11.305
MATT: As you exit the chamber, you can see the
various souls and planar that wander the halls on

02:57:11.305 --> 02:57:19.597
their own business have all now joined shoulder to
shoulder as a procession, showing you a respectful

02:57:19.597 --> 02:57:26.798
exit from the compound. As you walk, they all seem
to give a nod of respect towards Vex'ahlia, the

02:57:26.798 --> 02:57:35.434
now freshly chosen champion of Pelor for this
endeavor. As you step beyond the staircase that

02:57:35.434 --> 02:57:43.427
leads you down beyond the Fortress of the Sun,
into the center of the clearing that is watched

02:57:43.427 --> 02:57:48.935
and protected by the various trees of the
Dawnfather, looking out amongst the endless

02:57:48.935 --> 02:57:58.447
progression of the orchards, you consider what
your next path is to discover who and what this

02:57:58.447 --> 02:58:08.057
key is to Ioun, and hopefully there's enough
time., because time, right now, and the decisions you make,

02:58:08.095 --> 02:58:12.707
will greatly affect what can and cannot be done.

02:58:12.707 --> 02:58:15.295
And that's where we're going to end tonight's session.

02:58:15.295 --> 02:58:20.087
TRAVIS: Oh my god. What the fuck!

02:58:20.087 --> 02:58:22.233
MARISHA: Champions over here.

02:58:22.233 --> 02:58:23.478
LAURA: Oh shit.

02:58:23.478 --> 02:58:26.014
SAM: (singing) We are the champions.

02:58:26.014 --> 02:58:30.281
MATT: This is so fun. I haven't been able to do
epic-level content! That's so fun!

02:58:30.281 --> 02:58:37.542
MARISHA: Is every episode going to be this
emotional for the rest of the game? I can't keep

02:58:37.542 --> 02:58:38.588
doing this.

02:58:38.588 --> 02:58:40.436
TRAVIS: Liam, what did you say?

02:58:40.436 --> 02:58:43.787
LIAM: I said the twins are officially salt and
pepper shakers.

02:58:43.787 --> 02:58:45.706
MATT: You totally are.

02:58:45.706 --> 02:58:47.159
LAURA: Oh my god, and I have the white--

02:58:47.159 --> 02:58:49.207
MATT: You have the white dragon scale armor.

02:58:49.207 --> 02:58:50.182
LIAM: That's right.

02:58:50.182 --> 02:58:51.287
LAURA: Tight.

02:58:51.287 --> 02:58:53.346
MATT: That's actually pretty great.

02:58:53.346 --> 02:58:57.367
TALIESIN: I think this actually changes the crest
of Whitestone now, because now there's a sixth

02:58:57.367 --> 02:59:03.647
champion of Pelor who's of Whitestone. Six stars,
not five now. Holy cow.

02:59:03.647 --> 02:59:06.536
MATT: Oh man. You should really not change that
crest, because it's in the campaign guide that's

02:59:06.536 --> 02:59:08.458
being published in two months.

02:59:08.458 --> 02:59:09.848
TALIESIN: It would only be hers.

02:59:09.848 --> 02:59:11.899
MATT: Okay, there we go. I feel better about that
now.

02:59:11.899 --> 02:59:14.046
TALIESIN: It would only be her house crest.

02:59:14.046 --> 02:59:19.420
MATT: You know, it's okay, because the book
technically takes place before all of this. There

02:59:19.420 --> 02:59:20.527
you go.

02:59:20.527 --> 02:59:27.430
LIAM: Matt, I also have to throw out. We on Skype
now get the full Twitch view, so I'm seeing you

02:59:27.430 --> 02:59:34.337
guys with all your icons, with everything, and it
is the weirdest amalgamation of Baldur's Gate and

02:59:34.337 --> 02:59:42.710
Sega's full-motion video game from 1995 Night Trap
starring Different Strokes.

02:59:42.710 --> 02:59:51.121
MATT: That's all I've wanted. All I've ever wanted
as a creative was to develop, design, and produce

02:59:51.121 --> 02:59:58.241
what I would consider to be today's Night Trap for
you all. If we could achieve that, I've done my

02:59:58.241 --> 02:59:59.249
job.

02:59:59.249 --> 03:00:01.625
TRAVIS: Liam, we miss you! Ashley, we miss you!

03:00:01.625 --> 03:00:03.640
ASHLEY: I know, I miss you guys!

03:00:03.640 --> 03:00:05.641
MATT: Thank you for staying up late with us. We
really appreciate it, guys.

03:00:05.641 --> 03:00:08.050
ASHLEY: I love you, guys.

03:00:08.050 --> 03:00:10.613
MARISHA: We're god hunting without you guys. It's
weird.

03:00:10.613 --> 03:00:12.337
TALIESIN: We need our east coasters.

03:00:12.337 --> 03:00:15.207
ASHLEY: Man, to think I almost didn't Skype in
tonight.

03:00:15.207 --> 03:00:17.612
MATT: I know! I'm glad you could.

03:00:17.612 --> 03:00:22.280
LIAM: I'll give all my cows a hug for you.

03:00:22.280 --> 03:00:31.182
MATT: All right, guys. Our tickets for the live
show at Gen Con go up tomorrow morning. Look for

03:00:31.182 --> 03:00:33.706
that. Hopefully see you guys there.

03:00:33.706 --> 03:00:38.702
TRAVIS: It's in an even bigger theater. We had an
amazing time last time, and this theater is even

03:00:38.702 --> 03:00:42.858
larger, and will be mad, mad crazy.

03:00:42.858 --> 03:00:46.389
SAM: Live, in person. Find out how tall Travis
really is.

03:00:46.389 --> 03:00:47.710
LIAM: Four foot three.

03:00:47.710 --> 03:00:51.038
LAURA: We're all teeny.

03:00:51.038 --> 03:00:56.570
MATT: Well, thank you guys so much. Rest well,
especially you east coasters, and you east

03:00:56.570 --> 03:01:00.985
coasters, and you other country-ers. Have a
wonderful night. Sleep well.

03:01:00.985 --> 03:01:02.319
LAURA: Thank you Marvel Puzzle Quest!

03:01:02.319 --> 03:01:04.072
MATT: Thank you Marvel Puzzle Quest for being our
awesome sponsor!

03:01:04.072 --> 03:01:06.623
MARISHA: And check out the podcast!

03:01:06.623 --> 03:01:12.078
MATT: Check out the podcast, which is awesome. And
is it Thursday yet? Good night, guys!

03:01:12.078 --> 03:07:56.828
