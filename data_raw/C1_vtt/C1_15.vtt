MATT: Hello everyone and welcome back to Critical
Role. I know we missed you guys last week. We had

00:00:04.981 --> 00:00:09.467
crazy E3 coverage and the stream was fantastic in
getting all that to you, and to me because I

00:00:09.467 --> 00:00:15.159
couldn't be there. So thank you to the stream team
for making all of that happen last week. But we

00:00:15.159 --> 00:00:20.998
return, nevertheless, to the wondrous realm of
Exandria, and the adventures that happen in this

00:00:20.998 --> 00:00:25.638
wonderful world of Critical Role. It's been a
week. I'm a little crazed right now. So be

00:00:25.638 --> 00:00:27.379
prepared for crazed Mercer today.

00:00:27.379 --> 00:00:28.820
ORION: Yeah, crazed Mercer!

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:36.159
MATT: What could possibly go wrong? All right. So
before we get started here, a couple--
a few quick

00:00:36.214 --> 00:00:42.375
things, cool things! First off, guys, our first
winner for our subscriber giveaway is Valmoncen.

00:00:42.375 --> 00:00:49.351
Congratulations! You're going to win a signed
Player's Handbook and a signed cast photo so

00:00:49.351 --> 00:00:53.346
congrats to you. And we'll be giving those away

00:01:02.985 --> 00:01:10.863

00:01:10.881 --> 00:01:15.215
we're putting out there now. For all you guys out
there who could, go to the-- Hi there Sam.

00:01:15.215 --> 00:01:16.604
SAM: Hi!

00:01:16.604 --> 00:01:21.354
MATT: (laughs) If you have an opportunity, go to
the Geek and Sundry Facebook Page,

00:01:21.354 --> 00:01:29.062
facebook.com/geekandsundry, and share on there
both #CriticalRole and a reason why you think

00:01:29.115 --> 00:01:35.135
people should watch the show. And we will be doing
a giveaway for all the folks that do that, and that'll include a

00:01:35.135 --> 00:01:40.208
signed Player's Handbook, a signed photo, and this
fantastic D&amp;D Attack Wing Green Dragon Expansion

00:01:40.376 --> 00:01:42.584
Pack, which is just a cool looking mini in
general.

00:01:42.584 --> 00:01:43.921
MARISHA: I want that!

00:01:43.921 --> 00:01:49.274
MATT: Well too bad. They're going to get it. You
guys. One of you magical people are going to get

00:01:49.274 --> 00:01:55.843
this. So go to the Facebook of Geek and Sundry, share
your best reasoning to the world on there why

00:01:55.945 --> 00:02:03.618
people should check us out and maybe win that, which
would be cool. Also, as a heads up, let's

00:02:03.786 --> 00:02:08.251
see, we have a new shirt up! I'm sure you've seen a
fantastic new Critical Role shirt. It's only a

00:02:08.251 --> 00:02:12.740
two-week limited run again. It's designed by one
of our awesome fans, Matt Abernathy. Well done and

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:13.702
thank you!

00:02:13.702 --> 00:02:15.078
(cheering)

00:02:15.078 --> 00:02:16.548
ORION: Matt Abernathy! Did I say it right?

00:02:16.548 --> 00:02:19.477
MATT: You did. I believe so. If not, you're
welcome to get angry at us on the internet.

00:02:19.477 --> 00:02:22.588
But that just went up. It has our little
awesome 8-bit--

00:02:22.795 --> 00:02:24.448
SAM: Is there a time limit on those, Matt?

00:02:24.448 --> 00:02:25.550
MATT: Two weeks.

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:29.474
SAM: Two weeks?! You mean the people out there
have only two weeks to get this t-shirt?

00:02:29.651 --> 00:02:30.853
MATT: This is true.

00:02:30.853 --> 00:02:34.238
SAM: Will you tell me this. Is it made of fine
material? Is it a handcrafted t-shirt?

00:02:34.238 --> 00:02:37.823
MATT: The finest. If there were a t-shirt to gird
your loins with, this is the one to do it.

00:02:37.823 --> 00:02:42.605
SAM: You heard the man. The two weeks is ticking
now. Slightly less.

00:02:42.605 --> 00:02:45.926
MATT: And to be fair, girding your loins does
actually involve cloth. Look it up on Google. It's

00:02:45.926 --> 00:02:52.646
an interesting process, I think more people could
do it. It helps aerate the... anyway. And last

00:02:52.710 --> 00:03:01.175
thing! There's a cool RPG app game that launched
today called Soul Hunters, on app stores, iOS and

00:03:01.175 --> 00:03:06.414
Android I think, that I did some voice-over for a
few of the characters in the game. It's a fun project,

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:10.234
you should check it out. It just launched today.
But for the next 24 hours, anyone who downloads

00:03:10.234 --> 00:03:15.957
the game and puts in the promo code "Critical
Role" will get a free champion that I voiced. An

00:03:15.957 --> 00:03:22.203
awesome tank fellow who is a lot of fun, so go
check that out and get a free tank. And also for

00:03:22.203 --> 00:03:28.788
every ten subs we have ten key giveaways for the
game. I think it is upwards close to $100 worth

00:03:28.788 --> 00:03:35.945
in game giveaway material and free money and stuff
in the actual app itself. So every ten subscribers

00:03:36.018 --> 00:03:40.489
we'll be putting out a special key to that winner
for use in the Soul Hunters game, so check that

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:42.329
out! Good times.

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:46.707
SAM: Wait. Marisha. Say thank you for that thing.

00:03:46.707 --> 00:03:53.233
MARISHA: Thank you to whomever got us this amazing
super cool looking bottle of scotch!

00:03:53.233 --> 00:03:54.551
MATT, TRAVIS AND ASHLEY: What?

00:03:54.551 --> 00:03:56.064
LAURA: Whoa, that's magic.

00:03:56.064 --> 00:03:57.158
MARISHA: I know. Check that out.

00:03:57.158 --> 00:03:58.140
ORION: It's Taurez.

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:59.253
MARISHA: It's Taurez Brandy.

00:03:59.253 --> 00:04:00.963
LAURA: Wait! Wait, there was a card on the box.

00:04:00.963 --> 00:04:02.007
SAM: Oh yeah.

00:04:02.007 --> 00:04:03.047
MARISHA: There was a card on the box.

00:04:03.047 --> 00:04:04.240
SAM: But that would be over there somewhere.

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:07.437
MARISHA: We sort of wanted it now, so we jumped
the gun. I blame Sam.

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:09.076
MATT: Where's the card and the box?

00:04:09.076 --> 00:04:11.373
SAM: I threw the card on the floor and took the
scotch.

00:04:11.373 --> 00:04:15.595
ZAC: Okay, you guys. There was a card with stuff
on there.

00:04:15.595 --> 00:04:17.888
SAM: Oh! It's-- sorry.

00:04:17.888 --> 00:04:19.822
MATT: If you don't mind, go ahead.

00:04:19.822 --> 00:04:26.098
SAM: "Hi, Geek and Sundry Crew! So while this
package is actually mainly for the Critical Role

00:04:26.098 --> 00:04:28.708
"cast, I hope that they share it with you guys,
too!"

00:04:28.708 --> 00:04:29.964
MARISHA: Well...

00:04:29.964 --> 00:04:31.359
LAURA: Oh! That's not going to happen.

00:04:31.359 --> 00:04:35.392
SAM: Oh, I guess that means these guys. "It's a
small way of thanking you for all your hard work

00:04:35.392 --> 00:04:40.410
"for bringing us Critical Role every week and
making my life a bit more bearable. I would so

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:45.622
"appreciate holding off on giving this to the cast
until the entire party is there--" Sorry Liam. "I

00:04:45.622 --> 00:04:49.805
"should've also sent you a note for the cast,
through Twitch to go along with the package and it

00:04:49.805 --> 00:04:53.719
"would be amazing if you could ensure that they get it along with the
package. Keep being awesome! Prometheus Theus."

00:04:53.841 --> 00:04:55.620
MATT: Thank you, Prometheus Theus!

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:57.271
LAURA: See, that's why you read the card before
you open the box.

00:04:57.323 --> 00:04:58.519
MARISHA: Thanks, Prometheus!

00:04:58.519 --> 00:04:59.795
ORION: Thank you, Prometheus.

00:04:59.795 --> 00:05:00.676
ASHLEY: Where's Taliesin?

00:05:00.676 --> 00:05:04.886
MATT: Taliesin will be here shortly, he's running
a little behind. Yeah, the problem with having

00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:07.873
this at 7PM on a Thursday in Los Angeles is that
depending on where you're coming from, you may

00:05:07.873 --> 00:05:10.557
not get here by 7PM. But he'll be here shortly.

00:05:10.625 --> 00:05:12.549
MARISHA: That's true, yeah, Taliesin's coming.

00:05:12.549 --> 00:05:15.691
MATT: Thank you! That's amazing. And whenever that
is done, that bottle is going to be repurposed for

00:05:15.881 --> 00:05:17.731
some sort of potion. It's happening.

00:05:17.731 --> 00:05:19.523
ASHLEY: Oh, we could make it a candle.

00:05:19.523 --> 00:05:21.278
MATT: Oh yeah. Whoa.

00:05:21.351 --> 00:05:24.030
LAURA: Ashley makes awesome candles out of
bottles.

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:25.769
ASHLEY: Well you just put the lighter fluid and a
rope--

00:05:25.769 --> 00:05:27.029
MATT: So we're doing that, right?

00:05:27.029 --> 00:05:28.002
ASHLEY: Yeah.

00:05:28.002 --> 00:05:33.374
MATT: That lives now as an alcoholic container,
but will eventually become an awesome on-set

00:05:33.374 --> 00:05:36.545
candle. So thank you so much Prometheus, that's
amazing.

00:05:36.545 --> 00:05:37.944
ORION: Yes, thank you Prometheus.

00:05:37.944 --> 00:05:39.010
MARISHA: Thank you!

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:42.673
MATT: Also we have a couple other gifts to give
out. They weren't here last week so we couldn't

00:05:42.673 --> 00:05:46.416
give them away yet, but we have a couple of gifts
over there for I believe Laura and Travis, or more

00:05:46.416 --> 00:05:48.425
specifically Vex and Grog...

00:05:48.425 --> 00:05:49.857
ZAC: We need to wait until
the end of the show.

00:05:49.857 --> 00:05:50.903
MATT: To give those away?

00:05:50.903 --> 00:05:52.109
ZAC: We have a ton of stuff to give you.

00:05:52.109 --> 00:05:53.110
MATT: Oh! Really?

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:54.459
LAURA: Really? Are we waiting for the end?

00:05:54.459 --> 00:05:55.458
SAM: Then let's wait.

00:05:55.458 --> 00:05:56.434
LAURA: Okay.

00:05:56.434 --> 00:05:58.119
ZAC: Yeah, we have a lot of presents to give you
guys.

00:05:58.119 --> 00:06:01.513
MATT: Okay. Well then, we shall wait.

00:06:01.513 --> 00:06:09.172
MARISHA: Hi Liam! We miss you so much!

00:06:09.229 --> 00:06:11.520
LIAM: I know. I wish I was there.

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:13.947
MARISHA: Hi. How's New York?

00:06:13.947 --> 00:06:16.168
LIAM: Muggy and hot.

00:06:16.168 --> 00:06:17.531
MARISHA: Yay.

00:06:17.531 --> 00:06:18.891
TRAVIS: We need better speakers.

00:06:18.891 --> 00:06:21.221
ORION: Are you in a Broadway play?

00:06:21.221 --> 00:06:23.649
LAURA: He is in a Broadway play.

00:06:23.649 --> 00:06:25.706
ORION: Are you seeing Grease? Is that what's going
on?

00:06:25.706 --> 00:06:28.189
MARISHA: (laughs) Seriously...

00:06:28.189 --> 00:06:29.613
SAM: Hey, Travis.

00:06:29.613 --> 00:06:34.657
MATT: All right. So we're getting better speakers
for Liam here, but he'll be up for joining us via

00:06:34.657 --> 00:06:36.270
Skype, and Taliesin will be here shortly.

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:40.074
SAM: Okay. What do we got to do? Should we play
the game?

00:06:40.074 --> 00:06:41.169
MATT: I think we're going to jump in here.

00:06:41.169 --> 00:06:43.810
SAM: Okay! Everyone! Settle! Settle! Let's
play the game!

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:48.132
MATT: All right, we're going to get a speaker set
up for Liam, but nevertheless we shall hop

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:49.248
in here and start playing.

00:06:49.248 --> 00:06:50.589
LAURA: It's chaos today.

00:06:50.589 --> 00:06:53.444
MATT: Oh yeah. And I would like to recommend also
that we try to prevent cross-talk, so be aware.

00:06:53.444 --> 00:06:59.442
MATT and LAURA: (sing) Cross-talk.

00:06:59.442 --> 00:07:05.136
MATT: Oh, Crossfire. Some things never go away. All
right, so! For those of you who are joining us for

00:07:05.136 --> 00:07:09.315
the first time, welcome. For those of you who have
been with us for the entire journey, welcome as

00:07:09.385 --> 00:07:14.622
well. Bunch of crazy voice actors here, playing
D&amp;D. The party had just recently completed an

00:07:14.622 --> 00:07:21.111
extensive quest through the Underdark beneath the
dwarven city of Kraghammer, in which they battled

00:07:21.111 --> 00:07:27.512
with mind flayers, and duergar, and eventually a
giant crazed beholder that was possessed by an

00:07:27.512 --> 00:07:31.669
ancient artifact called the Horn of Orcus. Upon
defeating the mind flayers and making a dramatic

00:07:31.669 --> 00:07:37.950
escape, thanks to Tiberius, back to their hometown
of Emon, they met with the council of Tal'Dorei,

00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:42.294
which they're a part of, to discuss what they
should do with this great, ancient, evil artifact,

00:07:42.294 --> 00:07:46.500
the Horn of Orcus. The council discussed it, most
of the knowledge seemed to be that it could not,

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:52.481
or there is no known way to destroy it. The best
means of dealing with it would be to reseal it in

00:07:52.481 --> 00:07:56.828
a place where it would be safe, forgotten, and
hopefully never rediscovered. It was decided

00:07:56.828 --> 00:08:01.909
amongst the council that the safest place to do
that is on the distant land of Othanzia, where

00:08:01.909 --> 00:08:09.115
there is a capital city known as Vasselheim.
There, supposedly, is the most well known,

00:08:09.115 --> 00:08:18.017
holiest, and oldest place of Kima's order of
worship, of the Great Platinum dragon Bahamut, of

00:08:18.017 --> 00:08:23.467
which she's a paladin, and supposedly they have a
facility or means of sealing it away. So it was

00:08:23.536 --> 00:08:29.550
decided that they would send away for a holy
container that could contain this evil without any

00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:37.287
worry of corruption or escape, carry it then, via
skyship, over the ocean to the distant land of

00:08:37.287 --> 00:08:41.773
Othanzia, to Vasselheim, the capital city, and
seal it away. After which, they went on a shopping

00:08:41.773 --> 00:08:49.685
spree to Gilmore's Glorious Goods. Met everyone's
favorite mage, magic creator extraordinaire.

00:08:49.685 --> 00:08:53.920
LAURA: Oh that's right! I want some stuff. Give me
stuff.

00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:55.539
MATT: Yeah, you guys have to figure out who gets
what, by the way.

00:08:55.539 --> 00:08:57.058
SAM: But we have to do this quickly.

00:08:57.058 --> 00:09:02.426
MATT: So bringing us back now, you've completed
your purchases, now as a party decide how to

00:09:02.426 --> 00:09:11.358
disseminate the items you've purchased. And once
you guys are ready, we'll take it from there.

00:09:11.409 --> 00:09:13.415
SAM: Okay, how many items do we have?

00:09:13.415 --> 00:09:18.928
MARISHA: Well they're a bit divvied up right now.
I believe Pike is holding

00:09:18.928 --> 00:09:20.596
onto the sword, correct?

00:09:20.596 --> 00:09:23.867
ASHLEY: And I also have a Pearl of Power, which is
up for grabs.

00:09:23.867 --> 00:09:26.026
LAURA: Ooh, what is that. Let me see, let me see.

00:09:26.026 --> 00:09:33.143
MARISHA: I'm holding on to a Ring of Protection
plus two, and a Belt of Dwarvenkind. Hello Percy!

00:09:33.143 --> 00:09:34.334
TALIESIN: Oh, hello.

00:09:34.334 --> 00:09:35.284
MARISHA: Hi!

00:09:35.284 --> 00:09:36.312
ORION: Hello, Percy.

00:09:36.312 --> 00:09:37.330
MARISHA: Good of you to join us!

00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:38.857
TALIESIN: Thank you, I just got off an airplane.
Hi.

00:09:38.857 --> 00:09:40.238
MARISHA: Yes, how was your flight?

00:09:40.238 --> 00:09:41.610
ORION: An airplane?

00:09:41.610 --> 00:09:44.958
TALIESIN: The flight was-- it was slightly shorter
than the drive here. Hi.

00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:46.085
ORION: Oh my god.

00:09:46.085 --> 00:09:48.047
MARISHA: That sounds about right.

00:09:48.047 --> 00:09:49.213
TALIESIN: This looks good.

00:09:49.213 --> 00:09:53.987
MARISHA: Please! Look what we got. This is a gift
from-- what's his--

00:09:53.987 --> 00:09:55.940
SAM: Oh! What's-his-butt has something.

00:09:55.940 --> 00:09:58.116
TALIESIN: (high-pitched) It's really good!

00:09:58.116 --> 00:09:59.790
MARISHA: It's brandy! It's really good brandy.

00:09:59.790 --> 00:10:01.116
SAM: Vax has something.

00:10:01.116 --> 00:10:02.196
LAURA: Vex. He's Vex.

00:10:02.196 --> 00:10:02.972
SAM: Jesus.

00:10:02.972 --> 00:10:04.012
LAURA: Just kidding, I'm Vex (cackles).

00:10:04.012 --> 00:10:06.574
LIAM: I have a Dagger of Life-Stealing, plus one.
I'd also like to say how much I enjoy being in

00:10:06.574 --> 00:10:08.695
Travis's stomach like Uatu.

00:10:08.695 --> 00:10:10.676
(all laugh)

00:10:10.676 --> 00:10:12.839
SAM: Nice.

00:10:12.839 --> 00:10:14.879
MATT: Love it.

00:10:14.879 --> 00:10:19.958
MARISHA: I have a Ring of Protection plus two, and
a Belt of Dwarven-

00:10:20.008 --> 00:10:21.623
SAM: What is that? What does that do?

00:10:21.623 --> 00:10:25.778
MARISHA: It gives you a plus two bonus to AC and
saving throws while wearing this ring.

00:10:25.778 --> 00:10:27.382
SAM: I need that.

00:10:27.382 --> 00:10:30.270
MARISHA: And then I also have the Belt of
Dwarvenkind.

00:10:30.270 --> 00:10:31.846
ASHLEY: Did you say the most amazing thing about
it?

00:10:31.846 --> 00:10:34.474
MARISHA: The Belt of Dwarvenkind?

00:10:34.474 --> 00:10:36.065
ASHLEY: Yeah.

00:10:36.065 --> 00:10:41.845
MARISHA: Yeah, you guys remember this? It gives you
a plus two to your constitution modifier. You have

00:10:41.845 --> 00:10:50.686
advantage on charisma/persuasion checks with
dwarves... and you have a 50% chance, each day at

00:10:50.686 --> 00:10:52.791
dawn, of growing a full beard.

00:10:52.791 --> 00:10:53.957
SAM: What?

00:10:53.957 --> 00:10:55.477
TALIESIN: Yeah!

00:10:55.477 --> 00:10:56.549
ASHLEY: I. Know.

00:10:56.549 --> 00:10:57.697
LAURA: That's amazing!

00:10:57.697 --> 00:10:58.726
TRAVIS: What.

00:10:58.726 --> 00:11:01.866
MARISHA: If you are incapable of grow-- oh, that's
right, because you guys tuned out!

00:11:01.866 --> 00:11:03.279
LAURA: That's right, we weren't here!

00:11:03.279 --> 00:11:07.218
MARISHA: Yeah. We realized this at the end of the
stream. At the top of the day, you have a 50%

00:11:07.218 --> 00:11:13.975
chance each day at dawn of growing a full, thick
beard if you are capable of growing one, or a

00:11:13.975 --> 00:11:17.447
visibly thicker beard if you already have one.

00:11:17.447 --> 00:11:19.883
TRAVIS: Wait, Tiberius is the only one that
couldn't grow a beard right?

00:11:19.883 --> 00:11:21.693
LAURA: Right? We could all grow a beard...
technically.

00:11:21.693 --> 00:11:22.944
TRAVIS: The ladies could get some stank beards.

00:11:22.944 --> 00:11:24.165
SAM: Can the ladies grow a beard?

00:11:24.165 --> 00:11:25.080
TRAVIS: Yeah!

00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:26.116
LAURA: We could, why not?

00:11:26.116 --> 00:11:27.481
ASHLEY: I mean, if our hormones were a little
different--

00:11:27.481 --> 00:11:28.737
TRAVIS: Yeah, I've seen some nasty she-beards out
there.

00:11:28.737 --> 00:11:32.162
TALIESIN: We can find them a nice lady to date. I
think it would work out pretty well.

00:11:32.162 --> 00:11:36.439
MARISHA: And if you aren't a dwarf, on top of
this, you gain the following additional benefits

00:11:36.439 --> 00:11:40.949
while wearing this belt. You have advantage on
saving throws against poison, resistance against

00:11:40.949 --> 00:11:47.185
poison damage, darkvision up to 60 feet. You can
speak, read and write Dwarvish.

00:11:47.185 --> 00:11:55.670
TALIESIN: I got one, too. I got the Manual of
Quickness of Action.

00:11:55.670 --> 00:11:57.623
MARISHA: That one, you should keep.

00:11:57.623 --> 00:11:59.311
TALIESIN: I'm keeping this one.

00:11:59.311 --> 00:12:04.998
LAURA: Do you guys have a problem if I keep the
Pearl of Power?

00:12:04.998 --> 00:12:06.365
SAM: What does it do?

00:12:06.365 --> 00:12:12.235
LAURA: It lets you use another third spell slot,
3rd-level spell. And I figure you guys all have

00:12:12.235 --> 00:12:15.520
better spells than 3rd-level, but I only have up
to 3rd-level.

00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:17.450
SAM: So it just gives you one more 3rd-level
spell?

00:12:17.450 --> 00:12:19.588
LAURA: Of my most powerful spell, which is my
3rd-level.

00:12:19.588 --> 00:12:21.069
MARISHA: That's just fine with me.

00:12:21.069 --> 00:12:23.350
LAURA: And they usually do a lot of damage with
the 3rd-level.

00:12:23.350 --> 00:12:27.251
MARISHA: That's fine with me, I generally have
enough spell slots.

00:12:27.251 --> 00:12:30.184
LAURA: You got that Ring of Protection. Or you can
have the beardy thing.

00:12:30.184 --> 00:12:37.130
MARISHA: So yes, we also got the Coldsnap Leather
Armor, plus two, which I was originally thinking

00:12:37.184 --> 00:12:41.333
for myself, but then I realized I actually have
decent leather armor that gives me spell

00:12:41.333 --> 00:12:44.532
advantage, so I'm good on leather armor.

00:12:44.532 --> 00:12:48.085
ORION: I could stand to wear it. I have no torso
armor.

00:12:48.085 --> 00:12:51.866
MARISHA: I thought-- are you sure sorcerers can
wear it? I thought they could wear robes.

00:12:51.866 --> 00:12:55.381
ORION: Cloth and leather. I mean, I just...

00:12:55.381 --> 00:13:00.877
MATT: Sorcerers can wear no armor. You are wrong.

00:13:00.877 --> 00:13:02.207
ORION: I can wear no armor.

00:13:02.207 --> 00:13:03.136
MATT: No.

00:13:03.136 --> 00:13:07.779
ORION: I have this thing that somebody can use.

00:13:07.779 --> 00:13:16.505
LIAM: Wait, I would just like to say, (creepily)
"Wade."

00:13:16.670 --> 00:13:19.909
SAM: Thank you... Vax

00:13:19.909 --> 00:13:21.912
MARISHA: Do you have any armor on, Scanlan?

00:13:21.912 --> 00:13:23.482
SAM: I have something.

00:13:23.482 --> 00:13:30.057
ORION: This would bring his-- with that and the
ring, if you wore this and the ring, it would give you

00:13:30.057 --> 00:13:38.683
plus three to your AC. So that's not a bad combo.
Because this will give you plus one to your AC.

00:13:38.744 --> 00:13:40.853
MATT: You have regular Studded Leather Armor right
now.

00:13:40.853 --> 00:13:42.517
SAM: What is that? How is that... is this better?

00:13:42.517 --> 00:13:43.838
MATT: Probably.

00:13:43.838 --> 00:13:47.711
MARISHA: Would that give him a plus two to his
AC?

00:13:47.711 --> 00:13:55.530
MATT: Coldsnap Leather Armor. This would be
leather armor, plus two, it would probably give

00:13:55.530 --> 00:13:57.583
you an additional plus one to your AC if you wear
it.

00:13:57.583 --> 00:13:58.700
SAM: Plus one.

00:13:58.700 --> 00:14:01.776
MATT: It's not studded leather, it's just leather,
but it's plus two to the AC, so yeah. Your AC

00:14:01.776 --> 00:14:03.532
would go up by one.

00:14:03.532 --> 00:14:07.130
MARISHA: Who wants the Belt of Dwarvenkind? Grog?
What's your constitution right now?

00:14:07.130 --> 00:14:09.175
TALIESIN: I think Pike should have the belt.

00:14:09.175 --> 00:14:10.243
TRAVIS: 18?

00:14:10.243 --> 00:14:12.912
LAURA: That's pretty high.

00:14:12.912 --> 00:14:14.375
MARISHA: Constitution up to a 20.

00:14:14.375 --> 00:14:21.147
TRAVIS: I want to grow a fucking beard. I know it
does other things, but with a beard--

00:14:21.147 --> 00:14:23.796
ASHLEY: The only reason any of us want that belt
is to grow a beard.

00:14:23.796 --> 00:14:26.442
MARISHA: Yeah that's true. I'm not going to lie.

00:14:26.442 --> 00:14:31.440
ASHLEY: I mean, even though there's some very
great... aspects... to the belt. That's a plus.

00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:34.322
TALIESIN: My question is, once you grow the beard,
if you remove the belt, does the beard fall off or

00:14:34.322 --> 00:14:37.649
do you get to keep the beard? Because then you
guys could just switch around, until everyone had

00:14:37.649 --> 00:14:39.622
the appropriate amount of facial hair.

00:14:39.622 --> 00:14:41.052
SAM: I'll take the armor.

00:14:41.052 --> 00:14:43.768
MARISHA: Or does it dissipate at the end of the
day when you take it off?

00:14:43.768 --> 00:14:47.642
LAURA: I think that's our wonderful Matt Mercer's
call.

00:14:47.642 --> 00:14:49.336
TRAVIS: I'll take it, we can hold it until
somebody else wants it.

00:14:49.336 --> 00:14:51.542
MATT: You have no way of knowing.

00:14:51.542 --> 00:14:53.483
ORION: So who's going to take the ring?

00:14:53.483 --> 00:14:56.164
SAM: What does the ring do?

00:14:56.164 --> 00:14:57.867
LAURA: Keyleth, I think, would like the ring.

00:14:57.867 --> 00:15:00.357
MARISHA: I would just like something to help my
AC.

00:15:00.357 --> 00:15:01.840
SAM: What's your AC?

00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:03.184
MARISHA: 15.

00:15:03.184 --> 00:15:04.704
ORION: That would bring you to 17.

00:15:04.704 --> 00:15:06.096
SAM: Mine's a 14.

00:15:06.096 --> 00:15:07.866
MATT: It is now 15 with your new armor.

00:15:07.866 --> 00:15:12.324
SAM: 15. All right, you take it. I'll just die a
lot.

00:15:12.388 --> 00:15:14.683
TRAVIS: Whoa, whoa, no. Not cool.

00:15:14.683 --> 00:15:16.294
MARISHA: Are you sure? I'd feel bad.

00:15:16.294 --> 00:15:17.361
TALIESIN: I wouldn't.

00:15:17.361 --> 00:15:19.890
ASHLEY: Hey Scanlan, what's your constitution?

00:15:19.890 --> 00:15:21.040
SAM: 15.

00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:25.657
ASHLEY: You'd look pretty good with a beard.

00:15:25.657 --> 00:15:27.834
LAURA: You would look really good with a beard.

00:15:27.834 --> 00:15:29.266
TALIESIN: Well, that solves it.

00:15:29.266 --> 00:15:31.035
SAM: Well wait, I thought Grog was taking the
beard.

00:15:31.035 --> 00:15:32.895
ASHLEY: Grog has it. Maybe you guys can switch out
sometimes.

00:15:32.895 --> 00:15:37.078
SAM: Take it. It's a belt, we can just-- oh, but
we have to bind it to us.

00:15:37.078 --> 00:15:37.949
TRAVIS: You can have it.

00:15:37.949 --> 00:15:39.075
SAM: No, no, you take it.

00:15:39.075 --> 00:15:41.696
MARISHA: Because Grog doesn't wear armor either.
He has better benefits if he doesn't wear armor.

00:15:41.696 --> 00:15:44.458
TALIESIN: There hasn't been enough in-game time
for this to have actually taken hold yet,

00:15:44.458 --> 00:15:45.649
has there?

00:15:45.649 --> 00:15:47.887
MARISHA: You keep take that, I think. It gives
you a bonus to your dex.

00:15:47.952 --> 00:15:51.365
TALIESIN: The Manual of Quickness of Action. It
takes 48 hours worth of reading it.

00:15:51.365 --> 00:15:52.541
MATT: Not yet.

00:15:52.541 --> 00:15:55.282
TALIESIN: Okay. So I'll have to wait... I'm
starting this.

00:15:55.282 --> 00:15:58.343
MATT: You can read it over time, like take a
couple hours out of each evening, then...

00:15:58.343 --> 00:16:00.762
MARISHA: But that means everybody got something,
right?

00:16:00.762 --> 00:16:02.086
ORION: Yes.

00:16:02.086 --> 00:16:03.064
LAURA: Yes?

00:16:03.064 --> 00:16:03.968
MARISHA: Did we divide it up that way?

00:16:03.968 --> 00:16:04.956
SAM: We divide everything up?

00:16:04.956 --> 00:16:05.774
ORION: Yes.

00:16:05.774 --> 00:16:06.802
LAURA: The only one who didn't is my brother.

00:16:06.802 --> 00:16:11.953
LIAM: No, I have a Dagger of Life-Stealing, which
steals life.

00:16:12.131 --> 00:16:16.235
ORION: And also, Scanlan-- and I bring out the
Ioun Stone.

00:16:16.235 --> 00:16:17.469
SAM: Oh, yes.

00:16:17.469 --> 00:16:22.132
ORION: Like I was saying before, you ran out of--
you kept running out of spells. This allows you to

00:16:22.196 --> 00:16:28.840
store extra spells. I propose a friendly trade for
the crown-- circlet-- hat?

00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:30.644
Whatever you're wearing.

00:16:30.644 --> 00:16:32.426
LAURA: The circlet with the hat.

00:16:32.426 --> 00:16:33.590
ORION: Is it a circlet?

00:16:33.590 --> 00:16:34.759
SAM: The Concentration Circlet?

00:16:34.759 --> 00:16:40.639
ORION: Yes. I think it would benefit you to have
the ring, some sort of spell storing, which you've

00:16:40.639 --> 00:16:44.946
complained about running out of spells the last
few times we've fought.

00:16:44.946 --> 00:16:47.267
LAURA: Oh. Sorry... sorry. I took that pearl and
you wanted it, huh?

00:16:47.267 --> 00:16:53.308
SAM: The pearl, yes I did want the pearl, but...
what? (confused laugh)

00:16:53.308 --> 00:16:57.316
MARISHA: It does what the pearl does but times
three.

00:16:57.316 --> 00:16:58.893
SAM: What does it do?

00:16:58.893 --> 00:17:04.166
MATT: It allows you to cast a spell into it, up to
a level three. You can do three 1st-level spells,

00:17:04.166 --> 00:17:10.243
or up to one 3rd-level spell, into the stone.
It'll hold it. And then you can continue on with

00:17:10.296 --> 00:17:13.156
the next few days and you can cast it from the
stone for free.

00:17:13.156 --> 00:17:15.233
ORION: You know how I keep casting? I keep hucking
spells because I keep casting them

00:17:15.233 --> 00:17:16.939
out of my Ioun Stone.

00:17:16.939 --> 00:17:19.236
SAM: So does that mean on one round I could cast a
spell and also activate the spell

00:17:19.236 --> 00:17:20.340
that's stored in there?

00:17:20.340 --> 00:17:24.462
MATT: It's still an action to activate it, but it
doesn't use your current spell slot, 'cause you've

00:17:24.462 --> 00:17:26.804
already stored it in there the day before.

00:17:26.975 --> 00:17:30.346
SAM: I've never run out of spells.

00:17:30.346 --> 00:17:35.862
ORION: You ran out of spells the last two battles,
and you said that "I can't cast this anymore",

00:17:35.862 --> 00:17:37.513
where you've--

00:17:37.513 --> 00:17:40.652
SAM: So it gives me an extra level three slot?

00:17:40.652 --> 00:17:43.956
MATT: Essentially, if you were to cast a level
three spell into it in advance.

00:17:43.956 --> 00:17:49.445
ORION: Or you can cast, like, three of those, or
three of those. Things that you would use for

00:17:49.445 --> 00:17:50.477
other deals.

00:17:50.477 --> 00:17:52.966
MATT: Essentially. It's up to you. You have the
crown.

00:17:52.966 --> 00:17:59.455
SAM: Let me think about it. Let's think about it
and strategize. We'll do this tonight? The three

00:17:59.455 --> 00:18:05.425
level spells I don't use as much as these. But, if
that's what you'd like...

00:18:05.425 --> 00:18:07.953
ORION: I would like that very, very much.

00:18:07.953 --> 00:18:10.129
TRAVIS: Has Vax come back from his man date?

00:18:10.129 --> 00:18:13.299
LAURA: Yeah. Are we done? Are we ready to do
things now?

00:18:13.394 --> 00:18:15.092
TALIESIN: I've been looking forward to that
conversation for two weeks.

00:18:15.092 --> 00:18:17.515
MARISHA: It's true. (giggles) That is a true
story.

00:18:17.515 --> 00:18:21.017
TALIESIN: It's been sitting going, "Maybe he'll
say this!" I don't know.

00:18:21.017 --> 00:18:25.486
SAM: Well. You did Silence me that time.

00:18:25.540 --> 00:18:26.653
ORION: I had to.

00:18:26.653 --> 00:18:28.729
SAM: You didn't have to.

00:18:28.729 --> 00:18:30.414
TALIESIN: You did turn him into a mouse.

00:18:30.414 --> 00:18:31.385
SAM: He liked it.

00:18:31.385 --> 00:18:32.640
LAURA: Yeah, a super cute mouse!

00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:35.033
ORION: No, I-- no. I was going to say you didn't
turn me back into a mouse.

00:18:35.033 --> 00:18:39.660
SAM: You also abandoned the party in our most dire
moments.

00:18:39.660 --> 00:18:41.039
LAURA: This is true as well.

00:18:41.039 --> 00:18:42.548
TALIESIN: But he then did get the killing blow.

00:18:42.548 --> 00:18:43.429
TRAVIS: True.

00:18:43.429 --> 00:18:45.013
LAURA: That... doesn't add to...

00:18:45.013 --> 00:18:48.752
SAM: Yes, so if I abandon you all and come in at
the last minute and take the last shot, I get all

00:18:48.752 --> 00:18:49.902
the credit? I don't think so.

00:18:49.902 --> 00:18:51.216
TALIESIN: I like to be contrary.

00:18:51.216 --> 00:18:59.175
ORION: To be fair, gnome, I never abandoned the
party at all. I was surveying the situation. My

00:18:59.175 --> 00:19:05.999
idea was not tried whatsoever. So I merely kept to
my word. I did not enter the premises. Only when I

00:19:05.999 --> 00:19:09.808
needed to save everyone's life, which is exactly
what I did.

00:19:09.977 --> 00:19:15.147
SAM: I'm so sorry, I missed the last part because
my awesome hat was blocking it, sorry.

00:19:15.147 --> 00:19:16.921
TRAVIS: Oh yeah!

00:19:16.921 --> 00:19:21.079
ORION: It's too big, you're saying you can't wear
it?

00:19:21.079 --> 00:19:26.457
SAM: We'll discuss soon.

00:19:26.457 --> 00:19:28.561
ORION: That's not Clarota's thing, that's a
different thing, right?

00:19:28.561 --> 00:19:30.034
MATT: Yeah, that Vax has.

00:19:30.034 --> 00:19:31.897
LIAM: Yes, I have the Clarota hat.

00:19:31.897 --> 00:19:33.133
ORION: And we still have that.

00:19:33.133 --> 00:19:34.736
LAURA: And it looks wonderful on you.

00:19:34.736 --> 00:19:36.568
TALIESIN: You look like Merlin from Excalibur.

00:19:36.568 --> 00:19:38.627
TRAVIS: Are we still at Gilmore's?

00:19:38.627 --> 00:19:40.702
MATT: You guys have exited Gilmore's at this
time.

00:19:40.702 --> 00:19:43.494
LAURA: Are we standing out on the street divvying
up random items?

00:19:43.494 --> 00:19:47.888
MATT: Yes. You guys are essentially in the middle
of the thoroughfare in Abadar's Promenade of

00:19:47.888 --> 00:19:51.129
Emon, bickering over the items you guys are
distributing amongst

00:19:51.302 --> 00:19:52.376
yourselves in broad daylight.

00:19:52.376 --> 00:19:54.018
LAURA: Well I've got a beautiful pearl, so I'm
happy.

00:19:54.018 --> 00:19:55.909
TALIESIN: I've got a book!

00:19:55.909 --> 00:20:02.108
TRAVIS: Are there any shady characters making eyes
at our goods?

00:20:02.108 --> 00:20:04.144
MATT: Make a perception check.

00:20:04.144 --> 00:20:06.588
TRAVIS: Me make a perception check?

00:20:06.588 --> 00:20:07.473
MATT: Yes.

00:20:07.473 --> 00:20:09.958
LAURA: Bust out those dice!

00:20:09.958 --> 00:20:14.498
TRAVIS: 15 plus... probably crap. Zero.

00:20:14.552 --> 00:20:20.189
MATT: (laughs) Looking about, there are a few
folks that walk by and give a strange eye to the

00:20:20.189 --> 00:20:26.444
seven, nearly eight foot tall goliath. But nothing
beyond what you're used to.

00:20:26.512 --> 00:20:28.221
TRAVIS: Oh, all right.

00:20:28.221 --> 00:20:34.640
MATT: Yeah. As a note guys, you do have about two
days before the holy receptacle arrives so if

00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:39.968
there's anything that you want to achieve in that
meantime, you're welcome to do so or you can just

00:20:39.968 --> 00:20:42.371
spend that couple days and relax.

00:20:42.371 --> 00:20:46.618
LAURA: What? I'm sorry Percy, are you talking?

00:20:46.686 --> 00:20:48.000
TALIESIN: I have chicken!

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.376
TRAVIS: On you?

00:20:50.376 --> 00:20:52.417
TALIESIN: I have some tinkering I'd like to do.

00:20:52.417 --> 00:20:54.129
MATT: All right. What would you like to tinker?

00:20:54.129 --> 00:21:02.095
TALIESIN: I would like to try and build a couple
things. I have a list actually...

00:21:02.095 --> 00:21:05.270
LAURA: Arrows! Arrows for me please. Darling?

00:21:05.270 --> 00:21:13.082
TALIESIN: No, no. Arrows are on the list. I want
to start working on some sort of tazing implement

00:21:13.136 --> 00:21:18.190
for direct contact. I want to do an electrical
charge that I can rev up.

00:21:18.190 --> 00:21:20.553
MARISHA: He wants to make Asami's glove.

00:21:20.553 --> 00:21:21.682
MATT: Okay.

00:21:21.682 --> 00:21:28.164
TALIESIN: There's that. I have a list of things.
How many things can I start

00:21:28.164 --> 00:21:30.466
poking with in two days?

00:21:30.466 --> 00:21:32.966
MATT: That glove, that's going to be like a 
week-long endeavor.

00:21:33.131 --> 00:21:34.711
TALIESIN: That's a week-long thing.

00:21:34.775 --> 00:21:37.081
MATT: Even the design phase will take you about
two days, acquiring materials.

00:21:37.081 --> 00:21:38.443
TALIESIN: Night vision.

00:21:38.443 --> 00:21:40.689
MATT: Night vision...

00:21:40.689 --> 00:21:43.149
TALIESIN: Into my current, existing helmet.

00:21:43.149 --> 00:21:49.255
MATT: Night vision, or darkvision, as you would
put it, would be more of an

00:21:49.255 --> 00:21:50.886
enchantment-based acquisition.

00:21:50.886 --> 00:21:52.530
TALIESIN: There's no way that I could try to pull
that together?

00:21:52.530 --> 00:21:53.679
MATT: Not via tinkering.

00:21:53.679 --> 00:21:54.501
TALIESIN: Damn it.

00:21:54.501 --> 00:21:58.214
MATT: The technological aspects are not,
unfortunately, that advanced in this time. Like,

00:21:58.214 --> 00:22:02.272
shades, probably. You could probably shade some
sun. But, actually looking in the dark, that's an

00:22:02.272 --> 00:22:04.635
actual-- would be more of an arcane situation.

00:22:04.635 --> 00:22:11.131
TALIESIN: So this boils me down to two thoughts.
This is good. I want to put a

00:22:11.151 --> 00:22:19.300
slight dent into the barrel of Bad News to get a
ricochet shot, so that it basically allows me,

00:22:19.352 --> 00:22:24.748
when I shoot a bullet, to also do 1d12 worth of
damage to one target that is immediately adjacent

00:22:24.748 --> 00:22:27.341
to the main target.

00:22:27.341 --> 00:22:29.739
MARISHA: Shrapnel?

00:22:29.739 --> 00:22:32.799
TALIESIN: Shrapnel. It's not quite shrapnel,
it's a ricochet, but yes it is basically a

00:22:32.799 --> 00:22:33.788
shrapnel shot.

00:22:33.788 --> 00:22:34.764
ORION: Like a bank shot.

00:22:34.764 --> 00:22:37.350
TALIESIN: Yeah, like a bank shot. A secondary
lesser damage.

00:22:37.350 --> 00:22:42.146
MATT: With the Bad News. It's going to be
difficult with the Bad News because the sheer

00:22:42.146 --> 00:22:46.341
power and force that that gun emits on its
payload.

00:22:46.341 --> 00:22:50.430
TALIESIN: Would it be possible, if I did it to one
of the barrels of--

00:22:50.430 --> 00:22:54.825
MATT: You could do it. I'd say it'd probably up
your misfire rate by one.

00:22:54.890 --> 00:22:56.181
TALIESIN: Ah, okay.

00:22:56.181 --> 00:22:59.641
MATT: So consider that. It's doable, but in
messing with the barrel, the chamber, and the

00:22:59.641 --> 00:23:04.091
trajectory of the weapon, there is that slight
increase in the possibility of it jamming or

00:23:04.091 --> 00:23:05.012
disabling.

00:23:05.012 --> 00:23:06.058
TALIESIN: Okay.

00:23:06.058 --> 00:23:09.521
MATT: It's a possible trade-off. With Bad News,
because it travels so fast to do that much damage,

00:23:09.715 --> 00:23:14.196
any sort of alteration-- it will either not change
the course whatsoever, or it'll blow up the gun.

00:23:14.196 --> 00:23:17.033
TALIESIN: I'll start the taser and work on some
arrows then. That's what I'd like to do.

00:23:17.033 --> 00:23:18.560
MATT: Okay. Arrows are viable.

00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:25.545
SAM: I go back into Gilmore's and I ask if
there's-- if either they or someone else they know

00:23:25.545 --> 00:23:28.426
can make a specific kind of potion.

00:23:28.426 --> 00:23:30.171
MARISHA: Oh, I actually join him.

00:23:30.171 --> 00:23:32.284
MATT: All right. So the two of you walk back in as
they're discussing this.

00:23:32.284 --> 00:23:34.227
Gilmore is still at his desk.

00:23:34.227 --> 00:23:35.832
ORION: I'm going too.

00:23:35.832 --> 00:23:39.675
MATT: All right. "I'm sorry, was there something
else you require?"

00:23:39.675 --> 00:23:43.073
SAM: I forgot to ask-- Hello, Gilmore.

00:23:43.073 --> 00:23:44.170
MATT: "Hello."

00:23:44.170 --> 00:23:47.377
SAM: You look particularly perky today.

00:23:47.377 --> 00:23:50.329
MATT: "I've had a rather good day, you could
say."

00:23:50.329 --> 00:23:56.757
SAM: I was wondering if I could inquire about a
specific kind of scrying potion that I would like

00:23:56.757 --> 00:24:02.894
made for me. It's a specialty item. I don't know
if any exist.

00:24:02.894 --> 00:24:07.866
MATT: "Please, do step into my office." And he
leads you into the back room, beyond the beaded

00:24:07.922 --> 00:24:09.692
curtain. (laughs)

00:24:09.692 --> 00:24:12.313
SAM: Oh! Is that patchouli I smell?

00:24:12.313 --> 00:24:17.524
MATT: "Quite an astute nose you have. I'll be
right in. If you don't mind, just hanging tight

00:24:17.524 --> 00:24:24.079
"just for a moment. Thank you." He steps off in the
back room and takes about five minutes.

00:24:24.079 --> 00:24:30.548
MARISHA: While he's gone, can I look around to see
if he has any books on how to start-- like a

00:24:30.548 --> 00:24:32.921
potion making for dummies book.

00:24:32.921 --> 00:24:35.338
MATT: Okay. So.

00:24:35.338 --> 00:24:50.060
SAM: Gilmore, when we get excited, I-- well, never
mind that. Anyway, I'm looking for a way, a potion

00:24:50.060 --> 00:24:59.316
that I could maybe drink or use, to help me look
in on a place that we've been to recently. I could

00:24:59.316 --> 00:25:06.541
maybe leave a mark of some sort, and then use that
mark to magically scry into that place.

00:25:06.541 --> 00:25:11.962
MATT: He gives you a long, hard look,
contemplating the conversation, and then you see a

00:25:12.013 --> 00:25:19.237
lightbulb go off in his eyes and he goes, "Hmm.
Curious. You're into some things."

00:25:19.237 --> 00:25:21.835
(laughter)

00:25:21.835 --> 00:25:23.341
SAM: I have a dark side.

00:25:23.397 --> 00:25:29.643
MATT: "Indeed. I could probably acquiesce to this.
Give me a day. I should be able to produce such an

00:25:29.643 --> 00:25:38.078
"item, although this is, I will say-- having not
been attempted, there comes a warning of possible

00:25:38.078 --> 00:25:39.684
"side effects."

00:25:39.684 --> 00:25:44.717
SAM: So I would be drinking this potion and it
could affect me in other ways.

00:25:44.717 --> 00:25:52.939
MATT: "Perhaps. The funny thing about unproven
magic is, well, it's unproven. I could give you at

00:25:52.939 --> 00:25:56.863
"least a 90 to 95% guarantee?"

00:25:56.863 --> 00:26:02.053
SAM: All right. And how much would such a potion
cost me?

00:26:02.053 --> 00:26:09.699
MATT: "I would say for the research, the
materials, and seeing as how you are indeed

00:26:09.766 --> 00:26:15.017
"sponsored by Gilmore's Glorious Goods. At
discount, 300 gold?"

00:26:15.017 --> 00:26:18.496
SAM: Wow. Did I give away my ruby last time?

00:26:18.496 --> 00:26:20.051
LAURA: I don't remember.

00:26:20.051 --> 00:26:21.104
ORION: No, you still have it.

00:26:21.104 --> 00:26:22.144
TRAVIS: You did not.

00:26:22.144 --> 00:26:24.001
SAM: How much would this get me?

00:26:24.001 --> 00:26:26.370
MATT: Go ahead and roll a persuasion.

00:26:26.370 --> 00:26:28.310
TRAVIS: Come on buddy.

00:26:28.310 --> 00:26:30.924
SAM: I don't have any dice! (laughs)

00:26:30.924 --> 00:26:32.482
MATT: There you go!

00:26:32.482 --> 00:26:35.314
LIAM: I almost gave away mine.

00:26:35.314 --> 00:26:36.954
SAM: 23.

00:26:36.954 --> 00:26:38.644
ASHLEY: That's a good one.

00:26:38.644 --> 00:26:39.952
SAM: Oh. 21.

00:26:39.952 --> 00:26:40.904
LAURA: Oh...

00:26:40.904 --> 00:26:46.240
MATT: Right. Oh! (laughs) No, as soon as you
procure it, he leans forward and snatches it gingerly

00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:51.703
from your fingers and looks it over in his eyes.
"Ooh! This is a fine piece."

00:26:51.786 --> 00:26:54.773
LAURA: (whispering) It's super-duper flawless 
'cause you put it in the Wheel.

00:26:54.773 --> 00:26:57.501
MATT: "For trade?"

00:26:57.557 --> 00:27:03.180
SAM: Just tell me how much it's worth first.

00:27:03.180 --> 00:27:09.657
MATT: "This gem would probably run you anywhere from
200 to 300 gold."

00:27:09.731 --> 00:27:13.166
SAM: Do I sense that he's lying?

00:27:13.166 --> 00:27:15.580
MATT: Make an insight check.

00:27:15.580 --> 00:27:22.574
SAM: Where'd it go? Thank you! Ooh! 11.

00:27:22.574 --> 00:27:24.325
(laughter)

00:27:24.380 --> 00:27:29.566
MATT: He seems honest. He seems like he's
genuinely looking to make a deal.

00:27:29.566 --> 00:27:32.303
TRAVIS: Do it.

00:27:32.303 --> 00:27:33.315
SAM: What?

00:27:33.315 --> 00:27:34.296
TRAVIS: Just straight up.

00:27:34.296 --> 00:27:35.094
LAURA: Do it.

00:27:35.094 --> 00:27:36.803
SAM: Yeah, let's do it. I'll give you the ruby for
the potion.

00:27:36.803 --> 00:27:37.756
MATT: "Very well."

00:27:37.756 --> 00:27:41.888
SAM: But I would love a hefty amount of a potion.
Not a single use, but multiple use.

00:27:41.888 --> 00:27:50.823
MATT: "Oh. I can provide for this fantastic
specimen, a three use potion? Is that within your

00:27:50.823 --> 00:27:53.782
"realm of possibility?"

00:27:53.782 --> 00:27:55.936
SAM: That would be lovely, thank you, Gilmore.

00:27:55.936 --> 00:27:56.966
MATT: "One day!"

00:27:56.966 --> 00:27:58.361
SAM: One. One wonderful day!

00:27:58.361 --> 00:27:59.601
MATT: "One day."

00:27:59.601 --> 00:28:00.875
SAM: One glorious day!

00:28:00.875 --> 00:28:02.890
MATT: And he rubs your shoulder and leads you
outside of the room.

00:28:02.890 --> 00:28:05.661
ORION: Wait! I have a two part question, Gilmore!

00:28:05.661 --> 00:28:07.329
LAURA: I didn't even think you were in there.

00:28:07.329 --> 00:28:08.444
ORION: I am!

00:28:08.444 --> 00:28:09.720
LAURA: Oh! Okay.

00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:13.765
MATT: Ha. Ha. As you storm through the beaded
curtain, as he's exiting. "Ah! I'm sorry, this

00:28:13.765 --> 00:28:15.041
"room is private."

00:28:15.041 --> 00:28:16.865
ORION: Oh. Everything's private, I guess.

00:28:16.865 --> 00:28:19.566
(laughter)

00:28:19.728 --> 00:28:29.194
ORION: I wanted to know, A: How much that ring of
Walking on Water was again, and B: If you knew of

00:28:29.194 --> 00:28:37.449
somewhere that I could have an existing item
enchanted just a little bit. Like make it stronger

00:28:37.449 --> 00:28:40.814
than it currently is, but not change it.

00:28:40.814 --> 00:28:48.327
MATT: "First off, the ring that we discussed as
our original deal, the price would run you

00:28:48.486 --> 00:28:50.017
"about 1,750."

00:28:50.017 --> 00:28:51.577
ORION: 1,750?

00:28:51.577 --> 00:29:02.938
MATT: "1,750 gold pieces. Should you be interested
still. As for-- enchantment is a largely permanent

00:29:02.938 --> 00:29:10.890
"process. To enhance an existing enchantment is a
dangerous task that has a very high probability of

00:29:10.890 --> 00:29:13.167
"ruining the enchantment that currently exists."

00:29:13.167 --> 00:29:15.190
ORION: Oh. That's good to know.

00:29:15.190 --> 00:29:22.983
MATT: "To increase it, such masters I hear exist
in the world, but they are very, very dead. Or

00:29:22.983 --> 00:29:24.897
"very, very hidden."

00:29:24.897 --> 00:29:26.357
ORION: Hmm. Yes.

00:29:26.357 --> 00:29:30.463
MATT: "However, if you wish to upgrade, we are
more than happy to oblige!"

00:29:30.463 --> 00:29:43.265
ORION: No, the Ring of Protection that I have is
one measure. I wanted it by another measure.

00:29:43.265 --> 00:29:51.233
I don't know how to phrase this in RP. So. I
wanted it to be-- to have--

00:29:51.233 --> 00:29:52.190
SAM: More.

00:29:52.190 --> 00:29:53.162
MARISHA: More protect-y.

00:29:53.162 --> 00:29:54.169
SAM: More bigger.

00:29:54.169 --> 00:29:55.221
MARISHA: More-- Yes.

00:29:55.221 --> 00:29:59.327
MATT: "Well. Perhaps we could have one made for
you. It would take a few weeks, but we could have

00:29:59.327 --> 00:30:00.453
"one waiting."

00:30:00.453 --> 00:30:03.971
ORION: Oh, very good. I would like to arrange
that.

00:30:04.114 --> 00:30:07.601
MATT: "All right. Well, you'd have to pay half the
price down in front." How much is your Ring of

00:30:07.601 --> 00:30:11.246
Protection plus two currently labeled as?

00:30:11.246 --> 00:30:14.180
MARISHA: 6,500.

00:30:14.180 --> 00:30:17.066
ORION: Man.

00:30:17.066 --> 00:30:25.328
MATT: "So 6,500. That will put you at 3,250 down
now. The other half when the enchantment is

00:30:25.328 --> 00:30:26.528
"complete."

00:30:26.528 --> 00:30:29.743
ORION: (quietly) That is insane. We didn't buy it
for that much, did we?

00:30:29.743 --> 00:30:32.230
MATT: They haggled it down a little bit.

00:30:32.230 --> 00:30:34.401
MARISHA: We tossed it in with a deal and stuff.

00:30:34.401 --> 00:30:35.488
TALIESIN: Stuff's expensive, man.

00:30:35.488 --> 00:30:36.880
MARISHA: Stuff is expensive.

00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:38.021
ORION: I'll chill for now.

00:30:38.021 --> 00:30:40.476
MATT: "Very well. Come back if you change your
mind."

00:30:40.476 --> 00:30:41.421
ORION: I will.

00:30:41.421 --> 00:30:43.338
MARISHA: Wait, did I find a book?

00:30:43.338 --> 00:30:47.824
MATT: Right. We'll get to that now. Roll an
investigation check.

00:30:47.824 --> 00:30:55.229
MARISHA: 18.

00:30:55.229 --> 00:31:00.170
MATT: All right. Asking around some of the
employees and keeping an eye out, there are a few

00:31:00.170 --> 00:31:06.490
books on herbalism, how to find and retain the
potent elements of various material components

00:31:06.550 --> 00:31:15.427
found in nature. Also, there are some bits of
information about how to extract materials from

00:31:15.427 --> 00:31:23.963
natural creatures, meaning monsters, beasts both
natural and magical. How to remove and preserve

00:31:23.963 --> 00:31:28.961
safely elements of their organs, and things that
can be used in various alchemical compounds and/or

00:31:28.961 --> 00:31:34.052
potion-brewing. There are no books specifically on
the process of brewing, but that is one of the key

00:31:34.052 --> 00:31:37.053
components to it, is being able to acquire those
elements.

00:31:37.053 --> 00:31:41.422
MARISHA: So I take those books. How much are those
books?

00:31:41.422 --> 00:31:47.103
MATT: It's a single book that contains everything
about the herbalism and a book about the

00:31:47.103 --> 00:31:50.225
extraction of creature components.

00:31:50.288 --> 00:31:52.524
MARISHA: So I take that book. How much is that
book?

00:31:52.524 --> 00:31:53.846
MATT: The two books.

00:31:53.846 --> 00:31:55.578
MARISHA: How much are these books?

00:31:55.578 --> 00:32:06.063
MATT: (laughs) You inquire with the employees.
"These books are marked currently at 25 gold

00:32:06.063 --> 00:32:13.955
"apiece. They are a second printing, but hard to
find. Do you wish to purchase?"

00:32:14.008 --> 00:32:17.403
MARISHA: Yes, I'll take both of them. 50 gold.

00:32:17.403 --> 00:32:19.473
MATT: Mark off 50 gold. Hands the tomes back.

00:32:19.473 --> 00:32:23.428
MARISHA: Also, did I talk to Gilmore about potion
classes?

00:32:23.428 --> 00:32:26.663
MATT: You did, and he said he'll take it under
consideration.

00:32:26.663 --> 00:32:28.027
MARISHA: He'll take it into consideration. Okay.

00:32:28.027 --> 00:32:29.694
MATT: He gave you a look like, "Hm."

00:32:29.694 --> 00:32:31.926
MARISHA: Like, maybe? Okay.

00:32:31.926 --> 00:32:34.410
TALIESIN: It's tough to tell. He sort of has that
look.

00:32:34.410 --> 00:32:39.829
LAURA: Without taking too long on it, I was also
hoping, while we're in town. That armor that we

00:32:39.829 --> 00:32:45.621
stole from the big rhinoceros monster in the
duergar castle?

00:32:45.621 --> 00:32:47.282
MATT: Oh, the bulette.

00:32:47.282 --> 00:32:51.015
LAURA: Yes. The armor that we took from him. Is
there any way I can find a blacksmith that can

00:32:51.015 --> 00:32:53.638
maybe upgrade Trinket's armor with that?

00:32:53.638 --> 00:32:55.096
SAM: Ooh.

00:32:55.096 --> 00:33:01.023
MATT: That's an interesting thought. All right. Go
ahead and make an investigation check.

00:33:01.023 --> 00:33:10.992
LAURA: Okay. All right. Here we go. Pick wisely.
I'm using the new fancy one, so don't fail me.

00:33:11.148 --> 00:33:12.505
MARISHA: (singing) Don't fail me now.

00:33:12.505 --> 00:33:13.542
LAURA: 20?

00:33:13.542 --> 00:33:18.708
MATT: 20. Easy enough. After asking around town,
you manage to find a few individuals to speak

00:33:18.708 --> 00:33:24.335
with. There are two armor smiths. One that dabbles
in both blacksmithing and armor smithing, one that

00:33:24.335 --> 00:33:32.447
specifically is an armor smith who focuses in
strange materials. Mostly ornamental, but has a

00:33:32.447 --> 00:33:39.826
strong history and past in warfare and honing
those skills towards the use of actual battle. You

00:33:39.826 --> 00:33:45.658
find it's a dwarven woman by the name of Karin,
and they send you to her facility. It's a very

00:33:45.709 --> 00:33:50.351
small, almost a hovel, but when you approach the
outside, you can immediately smell this strong

00:33:50.351 --> 00:33:58.456
scent of iron. Almost like a sulfur and different
other chemicals that are used when you're folding metals

00:33:58.506 --> 00:34:04.720
and making composites. You open the door slightly,
and it's very darkly lit on the inside. There's

00:34:04.759 --> 00:34:10.193
the heat of the forge, and you see this very
sturdy, muscular dwarven woman standing in there

00:34:10.257 --> 00:34:14.687
with her hair graying, and it's pulled back into a
very tight bun. She's wearing a leather apron with

00:34:14.687 --> 00:34:17.878
her sleeves rolled up, and she's in the process of
hammering down on a piece of metal over her anvil,

00:34:17.878 --> 00:34:20.244
just (ping, ting, ting).

00:34:20.244 --> 00:34:21.857
LAURA: Does she have a beard?

00:34:21.857 --> 00:34:25.200
MATT: (laughs) You see, there's probably a bit of
scruff showing at the edge of her chin, but not a

00:34:25.200 --> 00:34:31.018
beard per se. She doesn't seem to notice you.
She's just in the middle of her work.

00:34:31.018 --> 00:34:33.293
LAURA: (clears throat)

00:34:33.293 --> 00:34:38.707
MATT: She stops for a second. "Oh, sorry, I didn't
see you enter! Can I help you?"

00:34:38.770 --> 00:34:40.274
LAURA: Karin, yes?

00:34:40.274 --> 00:34:41.444
MATT: "Aye, I'm Karin."

00:34:41.444 --> 00:34:44.562
LAURA: Don't mean to interrupt. You look very busy
here.

00:34:44.562 --> 00:34:46.176
MATT: "Let me just finish."

00:34:46.176 --> 00:34:47.642
LAURA: All right.

00:34:47.642 --> 00:34:51.770
MATT: She gives you a nod (huffs), and then goes
back into her mode for a second. She makes you

00:34:51.770 --> 00:34:55.106
wait for a good six minutes while she finishes
hammering out this piece, turning and rotating on

00:34:55.106 --> 00:34:59.327
the edge of the anvil, hammering it into this
smooth-- it looks almost like a pauldron, curved

00:34:59.327 --> 00:35:04.503
point for a shoulder. Then eventually, she (shhh)
quenches it in the trough, sets it aside with a

00:35:04.503 --> 00:35:11.118
(tink, tink). Puts her tools down, takes off her
big leather gloves. Wipes her brow, and you see

00:35:11.277 --> 00:35:14.379
when she wipes it, she wipes the sweat off, but
leaves a big old grease mark where once was clean,

00:35:14.379 --> 00:35:19.179
and goes, "Sorry for the wait. So, what can I do
for you?"

00:35:19.395 --> 00:35:22.865
LAURA: I've heard rumor that you are a very
talented blacksmith.

00:35:22.865 --> 00:35:25.976
MATT: "Oh, aye. Depends on what you're looking
for. What're you putting in the furnace?"

00:35:25.976 --> 00:35:28.666
LAURA: I have quite an interesting proposition for
you.

00:35:28.666 --> 00:35:30.471
MATT: "I like interesting."

00:35:30.471 --> 00:35:32.929
LAURA: I may have some material you've never
worked with, I don't know.

00:35:32.929 --> 00:35:34.823
LIAM: Oh, here we go.

00:35:34.823 --> 00:35:40.228
LAURA: Would you mind stepping outside for a
moment? Get some fresh air?

00:35:40.228 --> 00:35:47.836
MATT: At this point, specifically, she goes from
extremely welcoming to a very nervous, untrusting look.

00:35:47.836 --> 00:35:49.872
LAURA: Believe me, you'll want to see this.

00:35:49.872 --> 00:35:52.491
MATT: Make a persuasion roll.

00:35:52.491 --> 00:35:54.220
TRAVIS: Why didn't you wink first?

00:35:54.220 --> 00:35:56.036
LAURA: You'll want to see this.

00:35:56.036 --> 00:35:57.553
MATT: (laughs)

00:35:57.553 --> 00:36:00.568
LAURA: Ugh! I don't know which-- that's the
problem with having too many. I'm rolling my

00:36:00.568 --> 00:36:02.682
Trinket die, since it applies to Trinket.

00:36:02.682 --> 00:36:04.064
MATT: There you go.

00:36:04.064 --> 00:36:06.173
LAURA: That wasn't good. Nine?

00:36:06.173 --> 00:36:08.852
MATT: It's okay, she rolled a two.

00:36:08.852 --> 00:36:09.978
LAURA: Yay!

00:36:09.978 --> 00:36:18.871
MATT: "All right, all right. Sorry, I don't mean
to-- I've had a few encounters in the past."

00:36:18.935 --> 00:36:20.061
LAURA: Oh.

00:36:20.061 --> 00:36:23.609
MATT: "But yes, outside." She walks out, and as
she walks out with you, you can see she reaches

00:36:23.609 --> 00:36:26.067
over and grabs a sheathed shortsword and keeps it
at her side.

00:36:26.067 --> 00:36:29.241
LAURA: No need for that, darling. Trinket!

00:36:29.241 --> 00:36:35.829
MATT: (bear moans) Your armored bear comes looming
around the corner, at which point she (yelps) goes

00:36:35.829 --> 00:36:36.934
for the sword instinctually.

00:36:36.934 --> 00:36:39.587
LAURA: No, no! Take a gander at his armor.

00:36:39.587 --> 00:36:45.386
MATT: "Oh. That's not bad. That's not bad at all!"
She walks up to him and carefully-- doesn't want

00:36:45.386 --> 00:36:46.390
to touch him--

00:36:46.390 --> 00:36:47.560
LAURA: He's friendly, don't worry.

00:36:47.560 --> 00:36:49.949
MATT: Trinket, of course, leans forward. (slurp)
Licks the side of her face, cleaning off some of

00:36:49.949 --> 00:36:57.164
the grease stain on the side of her cheek.
"(shocked laughter) Oh! That was unexpected. Very

00:36:57.164 --> 00:36:58.334
"friendly one."

00:36:58.334 --> 00:37:00.608
LIAM: Matt Mercer.

00:37:00.742 --> 00:37:02.071
MATT: "Trinket, is it?"

00:37:02.237 --> 00:37:03.429
LAURA: Yes.

00:37:03.429 --> 00:37:05.939
MATT: "You're a nice one, Trinket." She starts
rubbing the side of his cheek. (bear moans)

00:37:05.939 --> 00:37:08.017
LAURA: He likes you. I can tell.

00:37:08.017 --> 00:37:11.702
MATT: She starts looking at the armor. "It's nice.
Functional. It's taken a few dings. It's seen some

00:37:11.702 --> 00:37:12.955
"battle."

00:37:12.955 --> 00:37:15.736
LAURA: Yes, it has. I'm hoping to protect him a
bit more, however.

00:37:15.736 --> 00:37:19.785
MATT: "Well, I can see that. Who made this?" She
looks around and pulls it. "Oh, this is the mark

00:37:19.785 --> 00:37:23.845
of Westruun. This was made over in that--
(scoffs)."

00:37:23.845 --> 00:37:25.604
LAURA: Yes. You can do better, I'm sure.

00:37:25.604 --> 00:37:29.248
MATT: "Oh, they're not the finest over there.
They're functional, but not the finest. Is this

00:37:29.248 --> 00:37:31.841
"for a parade or is this for actual combat?"

00:37:31.841 --> 00:37:35.413
LAURA: Actual combat. Beauty? Not my concern.

00:37:35.413 --> 00:37:38.684
MATT: "All right, all right. And what materials
are you looking for?"

00:37:38.684 --> 00:37:41.059
LAURA: Well. (grunts)

00:37:41.059 --> 00:37:48.729
MATT: (laughs) As you slam down this awkward,
still somewhat wet in places, but mostly dried-out

00:37:48.729 --> 00:37:55.883
bulette hide that you guys carved from it. And it
is big pieces of plate scales with sections of

00:37:55.883 --> 00:38:01.158
leather underneath, interwoven. It is part of a
large behemoth of a creature. As you slam it down,

00:38:01.158 --> 00:38:07.158
she steps back for a second. "And you-- what
manner of creature did this come from?"

00:38:07.158 --> 00:38:11.045
LAURA: A very large one, actually. A bull--

00:38:11.045 --> 00:38:13.258
MATT: "Bulette?"

00:38:13.258 --> 00:38:15.275
LAURA: Bulette. That one.

00:38:15.275 --> 00:38:18.207
MATT: "Oh, I haven't seen one of those found
itself to the surface in quite some time."

00:38:18.207 --> 00:38:22.105
LAURA: It wasn't on the surface. We're a bit of
adventurers, if you want to know.

00:38:22.105 --> 00:38:32.163
MATT: She gives you this long look. Goes, "Right.
Right, adventurers. Of course. Sorry, didn't mean

00:38:32.163 --> 00:38:33.356
"to offend."

00:38:33.356 --> 00:38:36.205
LAURA: You've probably heard of us. Vox Machina?

00:38:36.205 --> 00:38:40.908
MATT: She stops for a second and goes, "Actually,
yes. I have heard of you."

00:38:40.908 --> 00:38:41.823
LAURA: Yeah?

00:38:41.823 --> 00:38:43.261
MATT: "Winter's Crest festival not long ago."

00:38:43.261 --> 00:38:44.912
LAURA: That is correct.

00:38:44.912 --> 00:38:54.557
MATT: "All right. Well, then. It's a pleasure to
have you in my little establishment and business.

00:38:54.557 --> 00:38:59.744
"Bulette hide? I have not worked with this." She
leans down and starts messing with it, seeing how

00:38:59.744 --> 00:39:07.330
pliable it is in sections. She goes, "There's
enough here to redo most of the armor. Most

00:39:07.330 --> 00:39:13.162
"places. I could minimize spatial use of it and
possibly get most of the main plates gathered. I

00:39:13.375 --> 00:39:14.990
"can work with this."

00:39:14.990 --> 00:39:16.184
LAURA: Nice!

00:39:16.184 --> 00:39:20.384
MATT: "I can work with this. It'll take me a few
days, unfortunately. It is a rare material."

00:39:20.384 --> 00:39:24.169
LAURA: Right. Is two days enough?

00:39:24.169 --> 00:39:25.645
MATT: "Two days?"

00:39:25.645 --> 00:39:26.792
LAURA: Yes.

00:39:26.792 --> 00:39:30.945
MATT: "I could. I'd have to charge you more, 'cause
I'm not going to get much sleep at that rate."

00:39:30.945 --> 00:39:35.419
LAURA: Understandable. How much is a bit more?

00:39:35.419 --> 00:39:38.854
MATT: "Well, you're providing the materials. That
definitely cuts the cost significantly. For my

00:39:38.854 --> 00:39:40.440
"time and work, and lack of sleep--"

00:39:40.440 --> 00:39:44.427
LAURA: And we will send many, many customers your
way.

00:39:44.427 --> 00:39:46.626
MATT: "Can I put my personal brand on this?"

00:39:46.626 --> 00:39:48.068
LAURA: Of course.

00:39:48.068 --> 00:39:49.334
ORION: Wait--

00:39:49.334 --> 00:39:51.619
MATT: "Well, then." You're not there.

00:39:51.619 --> 00:39:53.881
LAURA: (whispering) Trinket isn't sponsored, it's
just fucking us.

00:39:53.881 --> 00:39:55.847
ORION: Okay.

00:39:55.847 --> 00:39:58.129
MATT: "500 gold suffice?"

00:39:58.129 --> 00:40:02.739
LAURA: How about 450?

00:40:02.739 --> 00:40:06.014
MATT: Make a persuasion roll.

00:40:06.014 --> 00:40:07.597
LAURA: Shit.

00:40:07.597 --> 00:40:08.845
MATT: Oh, Vex.

00:40:08.845 --> 00:40:10.833
SAM: Why must you dicker?

00:40:10.833 --> 00:40:12.935
LAURA: Because I want to.

00:40:12.935 --> 00:40:14.601
ASHLEY: Yeah!

00:40:14.601 --> 00:40:21.607
LAURA: Wah-wah! That would be 26.

00:40:21.607 --> 00:40:25.759
MATT: She looks you over for a second, looks at
the material, and you can see in her eyes, there's

00:40:25.829 --> 00:40:33.541
this interest in working with this material, never
touched or worked with it. She goes,

00:40:33.541 --> 00:40:37.191
"(spits) 450."

00:40:37.191 --> 00:40:38.733
LAURA: (spits) Deal.

00:40:38.733 --> 00:40:39.694
MATT: Shakes hands.

00:40:39.694 --> 00:40:40.567
LAURA: See you in a few days.

00:40:40.567 --> 00:40:41.243
MATT: "All right."

00:40:41.243 --> 00:40:42.142
LAURA: Two days.

00:40:42.142 --> 00:40:47.365
MATT: "Two days. All right." And she leans down,
picks it up, it is heavy material-- for the most

00:40:47.545 --> 00:40:52.266
part carrying it around was his job in the bag of
holding. She lifts it over one shoulder, (rgh)

00:40:52.266 --> 00:40:53.922
heads right into the workshop--

00:40:53.922 --> 00:40:54.929
LAURA: Thank you, Karin!

00:40:54.929 --> 00:40:59.178
MATT: Stops for a second, turns around. "Do you
mind if I take that armor in the meantime? I

00:40:59.178 --> 00:41:00.821
"figure I could use that to base the pattern."

00:41:00.821 --> 00:41:02.772
LAURA: Oh, of course, yeah! Use it together.
Trinket.

00:41:02.772 --> 00:41:07.165
MATT: Take about 15 minutes, she helps take the
armor off, she leads it all into the shop, and she

00:41:07.165 --> 00:41:10.691
goes, "All right. See you in a few days." Closes
her door. (bff)

00:41:10.691 --> 00:41:18.486
LAURA: Trinket, look at you naked. So cute. All
right, sorry that took so long.

00:41:18.486 --> 00:41:21.612
SAM: Hi, you're back! All right. Shall we start
adventuring, then?

00:41:21.612 --> 00:41:24.161
ORION: Where? There's two days to hang out.

00:41:24.161 --> 00:41:26.000
SAM: Two days, oh, we're not leaving yet?

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:26.978
LAURA: No.

00:41:26.978 --> 00:41:28.969
SAM: I was mostly spacing out last time.

00:41:28.969 --> 00:41:30.810
MATT: If there's anything else you guys want to
achieve in these next two days, you're welcome to

00:41:30.810 --> 00:41:34.168
do it now, or we could go ahead and say you relax
and take the time to fast-forward through the

00:41:34.168 --> 00:41:35.311
two-day period.

00:41:35.311 --> 00:41:36.725
TALIESIN: I'll do my tinkering rolls and then I'm
good.

00:41:36.725 --> 00:41:38.893
MATT: All right, so. First you wanted to work
on?

00:41:38.893 --> 00:41:44.723
TALIESIN: I wanted to work on a grappling-hook
arrow that attaches to the unending-- that ties to

00:41:44.723 --> 00:41:48.419
the unending rope so that we have actually
something that will pierce

00:41:48.419 --> 00:41:50.264
heavy stone and anchor.

00:41:50.264 --> 00:41:51.664
MATT: Okay, all right.

00:41:51.664 --> 00:41:58.338
TALIESIN: Like Batman. I don't know why Batman's
on the brain right now. Could be any reason.

00:41:58.338 --> 00:41:59.878
MATT: All right.

00:41:59.878 --> 00:42:11.723
ORION: I have an Earring of the Wind that I made
that I have not enchanted yet. Can I enchant that

00:42:11.723 --> 00:42:14.113
in two days to make another one?

00:42:14.166 --> 00:42:16.614
MATT: Another one of the speaking earrings?

00:42:16.614 --> 00:42:23.466
ORION: There is the existing functional one, but
over the time since I gave them out I only had

00:42:23.466 --> 00:42:26.414
time to make one extra one, but I have to enchant
them also.

00:42:26.414 --> 00:42:29.890
MATT: Yeah, I would say you could begin the process, you
get halfway through. It would take you the better

00:42:29.966 --> 00:42:35.008
part of a week to complete the earring, which is
what it did before when you first made them. But

00:42:35.008 --> 00:42:38.843
you can begin the process. You definitely have
your laboratory now in Greyskull Keep, and that

00:42:38.843 --> 00:42:41.896
gives you a bonus to the rolls you make to
enchant it.

00:42:41.896 --> 00:42:45.778
ORION: Ooh, can I start it and then if we leave I
can have one of the helpers--

00:42:45.831 --> 00:42:48.061
MATT: You could probably have Allura come and
finish it if you wanted to ask her.

00:42:48.061 --> 00:42:50.082
ORION: Oh, okay, well. Cool then.

00:42:50.082 --> 00:42:52.783
MATT: She doesn't have anything better to do.
(laughs)

00:42:52.783 --> 00:42:55.867
ORION: I'll start that, yeah. I'll start doing
the one that I made.

00:42:55.867 --> 00:42:59.196
MATT: Okay, getting the enchantment on that. All
right. Go ahead and make your

00:42:59.196 --> 00:43:00.543
first tinkering check.

00:43:00.543 --> 00:43:04.947
TALIESIN: All right. First tinkering roll is 13.

00:43:04.947 --> 00:43:12.849
MATT: 13. Okay. So as opposed to an actual arrow,
what you're doing is you take an extended crossbow

00:43:12.921 --> 00:43:20.754
bolt, you blacksmith onto the end of it, extending
it to what would be an actual full-scale longbow

00:43:20.754 --> 00:43:26.180
arrow length, but it is a thick metal rod. From
there you create the grappling hook end to it and

00:43:26.180 --> 00:43:30.163
what would be essentially-- it's thin, and then
once the rope is pulled or tugged from the back,

00:43:30.163 --> 00:43:36.798
it retracts the front part to extend it into a
grappling hook. You get through the process of

00:43:36.798 --> 00:43:42.104
creating the rod, and you sketch in a few ideas
for the actual portion of the end of the arrow

00:43:42.104 --> 00:43:46.850
that would extend into the grappling hook portion.
Go ahead and make a secondary roll.

00:43:46.850 --> 00:43:49.069
TALIESIN: 12.

00:43:49.069 --> 00:43:55.477
MATT: 12? Okay. You're having-- this is including
your tinker bonus, your--

00:43:55.477 --> 00:43:57.406
TALIESIN: Just proficiency bonus.

00:43:57.406 --> 00:44:07.310
MATT: Yeah. So you started having a little bit of
a problem with the mechanism. It keeps sticking

00:44:07.310 --> 00:44:13.435
and having a hard time actually retracting or
springing from the arrow point.

00:44:13.500 --> 00:44:14.672
TALIESIN: Damn it.

00:44:14.672 --> 00:44:17.046
MATT: It takes a little more time than you
anticipated with it. Go ahead and

00:44:17.046 --> 00:44:18.798
make a final roll.

00:44:18.798 --> 00:44:25.634
SAM: I'm going to inspire him before he makes this
roll with a little inspiration song or something.

00:44:25.634 --> 00:44:29.791
MATT: So Scanlan comes down into your workshop
underneath Greyskull Keep. You hear a fine little

00:44:29.791 --> 00:44:31.868
ditty to inspire you in your work.

00:44:31.868 --> 00:44:42.067
SAM: (sings) Whoa, I hear you're tinkering,
whoa, please do it well. Take my hand and you'll

00:44:42.067 --> 00:44:44.074
tinker I swear.

00:44:44.074 --> 00:44:48.181
ALL: (sing) Whoa! Please do it well.

00:44:48.181 --> 00:44:49.949
(laughter)

00:44:49.949 --> 00:44:51.689
TALIESIN: I feel inspired.

00:44:51.689 --> 00:44:53.334
SAM: (sing) Tinkering on a prayer!

00:44:53.334 --> 00:44:55.184
TALIESIN: There we go. Now I feel inspired.

00:44:55.184 --> 00:45:00.551
MATT: I was about to give you a d6, but that'll be
the full d10. So on this final roll, go ahead

00:45:00.551 --> 00:45:02.470
and-- what did you roll initially?

00:45:02.470 --> 00:45:05.736
TALIESIN: I actually don't even remember, but it
wasn't that bad.

00:45:05.787 --> 00:45:07.305
MATT: All right, go.

00:45:07.305 --> 00:45:12.528
TALIESIN: All right. So that's 18.

00:45:12.528 --> 00:45:17.202
MATT: 18, okay. With that bit of inspiration going
in your little Scanlan-based soundtrack--

00:45:17.202 --> 00:45:19.502
TALIESIN: (sings) Tinkering on a prayer.

00:45:19.502 --> 00:45:23.488
MATT: -- you realize that some of the gears that
were sticking, you recut them out, insert it, and

00:45:23.488 --> 00:45:28.423
like butter (shnk) it sticks out and retracts. So
you have one grappling arrow completed. For

00:45:28.423 --> 00:45:30.472
material costs, it came to about 100 gold.

00:45:30.472 --> 00:45:33.850
TALIESIN: 100 gold. And then I want to try and
recreate the exploding arrow as my last little

00:45:33.850 --> 00:45:35.351
thing I want to do today.

00:45:35.351 --> 00:45:36.354
MATT: Okay, okay.

00:45:36.354 --> 00:45:38.293
MARISHA: Guys, we've got to go back and get our
money.

00:45:38.293 --> 00:45:40.259
LAURA: Yeah, oh my gosh.

00:45:40.259 --> 00:45:41.296
TRAVIS: Yeah, no shit.

00:45:41.296 --> 00:45:42.382
ORION: That's what we've got to do.

00:45:42.382 --> 00:45:44.725
MARISHA: That is like 30k sitting for us in--

00:45:44.725 --> 00:45:47.956
SAM: Can we just send our minions to get it? Like
our servants.

00:45:47.956 --> 00:45:49.640
TRAVIS: Vax has something he'd like to add.

00:45:49.640 --> 00:45:50.974
LAURA: What?

00:45:50.974 --> 00:45:53.779
LIAM: Pike, dear, dear friend, can you hear me?

00:45:53.779 --> 00:45:55.829
ASHLEY: Oh yes, I know, we're getting to that.

00:45:55.829 --> 00:46:01.150
LIAM: I was wondering if maybe you and I could
swing by the temple of Serren-rae and

00:46:01.150 --> 00:46:03.171
fix my foot.

00:46:03.171 --> 00:46:04.588
TRAVIS and LAURA: Saran Wrap?

00:46:04.588 --> 00:46:08.172
ASHLEY: Oh, it's Sarenrae, but that's fine.

00:46:08.172 --> 00:46:13.516
LIAM: I'm three-fourths an atheist, darling, but I
know that my foot doesn't fucking work.

00:46:13.678 --> 00:46:19.539
ASHLEY: Well, I know. And I was going to say the
past couple days I think I've spent at the temple

00:46:19.539 --> 00:46:28.110
trying to sort of reconnect and really just tune
in and apologize and confess.

00:46:28.160 --> 00:46:29.689
TALIESIN: Sounds like a day spa.

00:46:29.689 --> 00:46:31.033
LAURA: Ooh, that's good.

00:46:31.033 --> 00:46:34.057
MATT: And you return to this temple, the same
temple where you yourself were resurrected after

00:46:34.057 --> 00:46:42.261
falling to the treachery demon naught but eight
months previous. Returning to that place,

00:46:42.261 --> 00:46:46.538
especially after your recent journey and near
brushes with death again, is a very solemn

00:46:46.538 --> 00:46:51.023
experience, and there's a part of you that just
feels internally cold, both returning there and

00:46:51.023 --> 00:46:55.841
because of your strangely fractured connection
with Sarenrae since you delved into the Underdark

00:46:55.841 --> 00:47:03.741
and tapped into your darker side since traveling
abroad on the ship. You take approximately six

00:47:03.741 --> 00:47:13.452
hours out of each day to just go in silent prayer
and reach out to her. I will say, go ahead and

00:47:13.517 --> 00:47:16.194
make a wisdom check.

00:47:16.194 --> 00:47:21.166
ASHLEY: Okay.

00:47:21.166 --> 00:47:23.182
LAURA: Ooh, that's good.

00:47:23.182 --> 00:47:25.473
ASHLEY: 22.

00:47:25.473 --> 00:47:31.137
MATT: At the end of your second six-hour period of
intense--

00:47:31.137 --> 00:47:32.571
SAM and MARISHA: Six hours!

00:47:32.571 --> 00:47:34.050
MARISHA: It's like an ayahuasca experience.

00:47:34.050 --> 00:47:35.625
SAM: Did you have a bathroom break?

00:47:35.625 --> 00:47:37.678
MATT: -- intense communion with Sarenrae, sweat
pouring down your body. The room itself is pretty

00:47:37.678 --> 00:47:42.619
cold, but for some reason your body is just
growing more and more intense with heat. You feel

00:47:42.619 --> 00:47:47.684
yourself internalizing all of the steps and
missteps that you've gone through over these past

00:47:47.684 --> 00:47:52.686
six or seven months, trying to find your path,
rediscovering yourself and what you have to do to

00:47:52.686 --> 00:47:55.633
prevent yourself or any of your friends from
falling to the fate that you once did, and

00:47:55.633 --> 00:47:59.764
explaining to her that your love never left and
that this was all with the ultimate purpose of

00:47:59.764 --> 00:48:04.169
achieving her ultimate purpose as her instrument,
and you wish not to cross that again, and if

00:48:04.169 --> 00:48:08.652
there's any way to redeem yourself, to let it be
known to you. At the end of that period of time,

00:48:08.652 --> 00:48:17.415
you feel since you've lost that connection in the
Underdark, that thread reconnect, the warmth fills

00:48:17.415 --> 00:48:22.910
you, and the sweat stops as your entire body seems
to be humming with energy. For a brief second in

00:48:22.910 --> 00:48:29.093
your face, in your eyes, in your vision you can
see the beautiful gold, gleaming, fire-wreathed

00:48:29.093 --> 00:48:33.253
head of Sarenrae smiling at you as she reaches
down and touches the side of your cheek and says,

00:48:33.319 --> 00:48:42.648
"Be forthright. Be grand. Burn bright and
beautiful, and I shall always be at your side."

00:48:42.648 --> 00:48:48.651
And with that, she releases your cheek and
vanishes, the vision gone in the temple, and you

00:48:48.712 --> 00:48:53.081
can see two other clerics that were silent,
muttering prayer, have gone quiet and are both

00:48:53.081 --> 00:48:55.796
staring at you with a look of like, 'what just
happened.'

00:48:55.796 --> 00:48:59.830
LAURA: Yay, Pike, yay!

00:48:59.830 --> 00:49:01.091
ASHLEY: Yay, yay, yay!

00:49:01.091 --> 00:49:03.937
MATT: You look down at your holy symbol, and that
one giant fissure that had cracked

00:49:03.937 --> 00:49:05.314
has resealed itself.

00:49:05.314 --> 00:49:07.769
(all cheer)

00:49:07.769 --> 00:49:14.450
ASHLEY: Hey man, that was my new special Celtic
die that whoever sent to me.

00:49:14.450 --> 00:49:17.359
LAURA: Yep.

00:49:17.359 --> 00:49:19.539
LIAM: Celebrate by shitting on a bed.

00:49:19.539 --> 00:49:22.095
(all laugh)

00:49:22.095 --> 00:49:25.015
MATT: It's a cultural gnome thing, right?

00:49:25.015 --> 00:49:30.188
ASHLEY: So, well, to start things off, then, how
is Liam's foot?

00:49:30.188 --> 00:49:31.755
SAM: Whose?

00:49:31.755 --> 00:49:32.528
MATT: It's going okay.

00:49:32.528 --> 00:49:33.427
SAM: Who?

00:49:33.427 --> 00:49:34.545
ASHLEY: I'm so sorry!

00:49:34.545 --> 00:49:35.545
MATT: Who's this Liam guy?

00:49:35.545 --> 00:49:39.699
ASHLEY: I'm-- what am I saying? I mean, how is
Vax's foot? I'm not sure who Liam is.

00:49:39.699 --> 00:49:40.771
MATT: As you step out--

00:49:40.771 --> 00:49:42.368
LIAM: My foot's great, Ashley, thanks.

00:49:42.368 --> 00:49:44.757
(all laugh)

00:49:44.911 --> 00:49:50.823
MATT: As you step out of the central chamber of
the temple of Sarenrae, Vax has been waiting there

00:49:50.823 --> 00:49:56.476
for a while, wanted to actually ask for your aid
in this. As you see her step out of the main

00:49:56.476 --> 00:50:01.640
chamber, Vax, she has a look of serenity in her
face you haven't seen in quite some time.

00:50:01.640 --> 00:50:04.258
LIAM: Is this the moment?

00:50:04.258 --> 00:50:05.295
ASHLEY: Hi.

00:50:05.295 --> 00:50:08.681
LIAM: Should I take my shoe off? Vex, look, I'll
take my shoe off.

00:50:08.681 --> 00:50:10.089
LAURA: Don't do it. Don't do it.

00:50:10.089 --> 00:50:14.408
ASHLEY: Here, just sit on this rock, okay? Take
off your shoe. Hoo.

00:50:14.480 --> 00:50:16.467
TALIESIN: For the first time, you're safe.

00:50:16.467 --> 00:50:17.655
MATT: And he does.

00:50:17.655 --> 00:50:19.708
LAURA: Ugh. That's disgusting.

00:50:19.708 --> 00:50:21.163
TRAVIS: Proud of you right now.

00:50:21.163 --> 00:50:32.969
LIAM: It's still, you know, it feels strong, but
it's-- it itches. It itches me-- It irks me still.

00:50:32.969 --> 00:50:36.821
Perhaps maybe you could give it one more try
today? You seem to have a bit

00:50:36.821 --> 00:50:43.207
of a glow about you.

00:50:43.207 --> 00:50:44.455
ASHLEY: 30.

00:50:44.455 --> 00:50:47.198
MATT: That's a 30? 30 points of healing. As you're
saying this and you're stuttering this out, she

00:50:47.198 --> 00:50:50.931
goes into a singular trance, clutches her holy
symbol with one hand, and reaches out and grabs

00:50:50.931 --> 00:50:56.223
your foot with the other. Her hand almost burns at
the touch, something you instinctively pull back

00:50:56.223 --> 00:51:01.268
on, but her grip is like an iron vice and you
cannot release yourself from it. And as she just

00:51:01.268 --> 00:51:05.370
intensely focuses forward, you can see this
glowing divine energy transfer from down her

00:51:05.436 --> 00:51:09.790
forearm into your foot. Fear reaches you suddenly
because you don't understand the divine, and

00:51:09.790 --> 00:51:15.841
though you've seen some crazy things, this is a
little worrying. You've seen some shit. I want you

00:51:15.841 --> 00:51:18.438
to go ahead and make a medicine roll with
advantage.

00:51:18.438 --> 00:51:19.835
LIAM: It feels like IcyHot!

00:51:19.835 --> 00:51:21.989
(laughter)

00:51:21.989 --> 00:51:23.050
TALIESIN: Ye olde IcyHot.

00:51:23.050 --> 00:51:24.652
MATT: The scent of Vicks VapoRub hits your
system.

00:51:24.652 --> 00:51:26.929
LAURA: And another one, you get advantage, you can do
it again.

00:51:26.929 --> 00:51:29.892
ASHLEY: That's a lot better. 24.

00:51:29.946 --> 00:51:37.132
MATT: 24. As she releases her grip on you, the
energy fades, her eyes tend to come back into that

00:51:37.132 --> 00:51:42.468
natural, soft Pike image you're used to, and
looking down at your foot, you can see any

00:51:42.468 --> 00:51:48.660
noticeable sign of scarring, damage is completely
gone. Your foot is whole, intact.

00:51:48.660 --> 00:51:50.812
(cheering)

00:51:50.812 --> 00:51:55.559
SAM: And your nails have been painted red. Red
nails.

00:51:55.559 --> 00:51:57.134
LAURA: Hey, and you know what? It doesn't smell as
bad now.

00:51:57.134 --> 00:51:58.702
LIAM: I stick my foot in my sister's face.

00:51:58.702 --> 00:52:00.591
LAURA: Yeah, thank you.

00:52:00.591 --> 00:52:01.932
ORION: I'm going to miss that bit.

00:52:01.932 --> 00:52:04.277
LAURA: It doesn't even smell bad anymore, so thank
you.

00:52:04.329 --> 00:52:06.730
LIAM: Well, not so fast.

00:52:06.730 --> 00:52:08.960
MATT: Percy.

00:52:08.960 --> 00:52:10.185
TALIESIN: Yes.

00:52:10.185 --> 00:52:14.375
MATT: How many-- you have time probably to attempt
three arrows.

00:52:14.375 --> 00:52:16.786
TALIESIN: I'm going to try for three exploding
arrows. And I've built one before.

00:52:16.786 --> 00:52:19.045
MATT: Yes, you have, I know. I'm still keeping
that in mind.

00:52:19.045 --> 00:52:20.003
TALIESIN: Thank you.

00:52:20.003 --> 00:52:21.755
MATT: Materials per arrow will cost 50 gold.

00:52:21.755 --> 00:52:23.587
TALIESIN: Another 150 gold? All right.

00:52:23.587 --> 00:52:24.775
LAURA: I'll give it to you.

00:52:24.775 --> 00:52:26.944
MATT: So 150 gold for materials. You have your
goggles on--

00:52:26.944 --> 00:52:31.919
LAURA: I won't even haggle with you, Percy, I'll
just give it to you. I mean, well, you know. You

00:52:31.919 --> 00:52:33.302
know what I mean.

00:52:33.302 --> 00:52:36.478
TALIESIN: I certainly do. I know exactly what you
mean. No.

00:52:36.478 --> 00:52:38.286
LIAM: That's going a bit beyond winking.

00:52:38.286 --> 00:52:40.949
LAURA: (laughs) I know.

00:52:40.949 --> 00:52:42.545
TALIESIN: Now I'm nervous.

00:52:42.545 --> 00:52:45.667
MATT: So coming off the high from making your
grappling arrow, you sit down, you're alone in the

00:52:45.667 --> 00:52:49.513
middle of your workshop, it's hot in there, it's
subterranean, you have the glow of your

00:52:49.513 --> 00:52:54.498
candlelight around you, you have your goggles on,
your blacksmith leather gloves on, and you're

00:52:54.498 --> 00:53:00.334
tinkering with the delivery method of these small,
concussive arrows. Go ahead and

00:53:00.334 --> 00:53:03.593
make your first roll.

00:53:03.593 --> 00:53:04.784
TALIESIN: 18.

00:53:04.784 --> 00:53:12.024
MATT: 18. With deftness, you rapidly complete the
first arrow, wrapping up the powder charge, the

00:53:12.024 --> 00:53:19.504
impact point, and the arrow itself weighted to be
fair and balanced to be flung from a longbow. Make

00:53:19.504 --> 00:53:20.682
your second roll.

00:53:20.682 --> 00:53:22.141
SAM: Like Fox News.

00:53:22.141 --> 00:53:23.341
TALIESIN: All right. 15.

00:53:23.341 --> 00:53:27.546
MATT: 15. Second arrow takes a little longer, but
you still manage to keep the flow going, complete

00:53:27.546 --> 00:53:29.812
it fine. Third and final roll.

00:53:29.812 --> 00:53:31.013
LAURA: Come on, Percy!

00:53:31.013 --> 00:53:32.128
TALIESIN: Natural 20.

00:53:32.128 --> 00:53:33.656
(cheering)

00:53:33.656 --> 00:53:35.051
LAURA: That's an extra-special arrow.

00:53:35.051 --> 00:53:40.884
MATT: Not only did you complete this in record
time, but the arrow itself looks beautiful. It

00:53:40.884 --> 00:53:43.943
could be a display case item.

00:53:43.943 --> 00:53:46.294
LAURA: Does it do extra damage?

00:53:46.294 --> 00:53:53.373
MATT: You'll find out. But I would mark that arrow
separately from the other two.

00:53:53.373 --> 00:53:54.623
TALIESIN: You would mark it.

00:53:54.623 --> 00:53:58.504
MATT: Mark it as two exploding arrows and one
exploding arrow with a star next to it.

00:53:58.504 --> 00:54:00.805
LAURA: Okay, I'll do that.

00:54:00.805 --> 00:54:06.905
TALIESIN: So you have a grappling hook arrow, two
exploding arrows, and one exploding arrow

00:54:06.905 --> 00:54:08.579
with a star.

00:54:08.579 --> 00:54:10.140
LAURA: Come here, you beautiful bastard.

00:54:10.140 --> 00:54:15.580
TALIESIN: I'm getting to kiss everybody in this
game. I've already made my way through siblings,

00:54:15.580 --> 00:54:17.176
this is getting-- all right.

00:54:17.176 --> 00:54:19.657
MARISHA: That's so true, you have!

00:54:19.657 --> 00:54:21.769
MATT: Ah, you've been to that party before.

00:54:21.769 --> 00:54:24.109
TALIESIN: I've kissed the twins. I have, well,
thank you.

00:54:24.109 --> 00:54:28.190
MATT: All right, any other business you guys wish
to--

00:54:28.190 --> 00:54:31.895
TRAVIS: Yeah, is there a tavern nearby? Just a
quick question.

00:54:31.895 --> 00:54:35.287
MATT: There are many taverns. The one you know the
best is the Laughing Lamia, which you guys

00:54:35.287 --> 00:54:36.575
previously stayed at.

00:54:36.575 --> 00:54:38.001
TRAVIS: It's the biggest one?

00:54:38.001 --> 00:54:39.502
MATT: It's pretty large, it's pretty large.

00:54:39.502 --> 00:54:44.839
TRAVIS: I'd like to walk to the Laughing Lamia and
knock the doors open and as loud as I can, go,

00:54:44.839 --> 00:54:51.716
Listen up! I want to know if anyone has seen any
goliaths wandering around these parts.

00:54:51.716 --> 00:54:54.801
Aside from me.

00:54:54.801 --> 00:55:01.290
MATT: Do you wish to do this via conversational
persuasion or through intimidation? Because there

00:55:01.290 --> 00:55:03.602
are two ways you can go with this, Grog.

00:55:03.793 --> 00:55:06.067
LAURA: And you're wearing the belt that makes you
extra persuasive.

00:55:06.121 --> 00:55:07.388
MARISHA: Only with dwarves.

00:55:07.388 --> 00:55:10.132
TRAVIS: Persuasive... yeah, well, maybe there's
some dwarves hanging about.

00:55:10.132 --> 00:55:11.480
MARISHA: There might be some dwarves!

00:55:11.480 --> 00:55:13.380
MATT: So how are you doing this? Okay, make a
persuasion roll.

00:55:13.380 --> 00:55:15.169
SAM: Can I be with him just to watch?

00:55:15.169 --> 00:55:17.209
LAURA: Was there also a grappling arrow, Percy?

00:55:17.209 --> 00:55:18.084
MATT: Sure.

00:55:18.084 --> 00:55:20.104
SAM: Okay, I'm with you, Grog, just watching.

00:55:20.104 --> 00:55:21.390
ORION: I'm still enchanting.

00:55:21.390 --> 00:55:23.021
TALIESIN: Possibly reusable.

00:55:23.021 --> 00:55:23.984
LAURA: Ooh.

00:55:23.984 --> 00:55:25.260
LIAM: Yeah you are.

00:55:25.260 --> 00:55:27.042
MARISHA: Can I go read my potion book?

00:55:27.042 --> 00:55:30.339
TRAVIS: I got a four. With the belt.

00:55:30.339 --> 00:55:34.347
(laughter)

00:55:34.347 --> 00:55:35.658
MATT: This is.

00:55:35.658 --> 00:55:37.350
MARISHA: What dice are you rolling?

00:55:37.350 --> 00:55:41.122
TRAVIS: I grow a giant pubic mane from the belt.

00:55:41.122 --> 00:55:43.881
MATT: Enchanted merkin plus two.

00:55:43.881 --> 00:55:46.056
ORION: Dude. You've got to check your balanced
dice, man.

00:55:46.056 --> 00:55:50.388
MATT: All right. So as you burst in and shout this
to the group, everyone stops and turns and

00:55:50.388 --> 00:55:55.650
looks... and then goes right back to drinking and
their conversation. There appears to be no

00:55:55.650 --> 00:55:56.825
immediate reaction.

00:55:56.825 --> 00:56:01.487
SAM: Can I jump up-- I jump up on a table and I
say, Listen, you motherfuckers, my friend just asked

00:56:01.487 --> 00:56:05.698
you a fucking question, now fucking answer him or
I'm going to kill every last

00:56:05.749 --> 00:56:07.498
motherfucking one of you!

00:56:07.498 --> 00:56:09.641
TRAVIS: I'd listen to him, he means it.

00:56:09.641 --> 00:56:11.649
LAURA: Can you do that?

00:56:11.649 --> 00:56:12.577
MATT: Make an intimidation check.

00:56:12.577 --> 00:56:14.417
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah!

00:56:14.417 --> 00:56:15.487
SAM: Is this a 20?

00:56:15.487 --> 00:56:16.540
ASHLEY: Come on, Scanlan.

00:56:16.540 --> 00:56:17.545
LAURA: Please be good.

00:56:17.545 --> 00:56:18.581
ASHLEY: Come on, Scanlan.

00:56:18.581 --> 00:56:20.132
SAM: I rolled, that would be a 30.

00:56:20.132 --> 00:56:24.275
TRAVIS: Thug life. That's amazing!

00:56:24.275 --> 00:56:27.124
SAM: Oh wait, no. Yes, 28. I added wrong. 28.

00:56:27.124 --> 00:56:35.185
MATT: Oh, well that makes the difference. So in an
unseen display, the goliath storms into the bar

00:56:35.185 --> 00:56:39.978
and makes no impact, yet the tiniest gnome jumps
onto the table like a ravenous wolverine, frothing

00:56:39.978 --> 00:56:44.940
at the mouth, his wild eyes staring about the dark
interior of the Laughing Lamia. All the patrons at

00:56:44.940 --> 00:56:51.289
the table around him, you can see, lean back in
fear, caught off-guard by this entirely, one man

00:56:51.289 --> 00:56:56.741
holding a drink just drops it and you hear it
shatter on the ground. Everyone gets quiet again,

00:56:56.741 --> 00:57:00.471
but stays quiet. Even the small band playing in
the far corner, you hear like (gee-uh), a

00:57:00.471 --> 00:57:04.905
discordant sound as all instruments break to a
halt, the dancer stops, the whole room is

00:57:04.905 --> 00:57:11.700
dead-silent. At which point a nearby halfling, you
can see he's unkempt, farmer-tan looking fellow,

00:57:11.700 --> 00:57:18.339
looks up and he goes, "Um. No...?"

00:57:18.339 --> 00:57:23.784
SAM: Thank you for your forthrightness and
honesty.

00:57:23.784 --> 00:57:30.185
MATT: At which point a hand claps your shoulder.
You look over and there's a human there, a bearded

00:57:30.185 --> 00:57:36.757
older man in his 40s, his hair trimmed very very
short, crew-cut almost. He's wearing what looks

00:57:36.757 --> 00:57:40.643
like a patchwork scalemail almost, like mostly
leather but there's a lot of chunks of scales put

00:57:40.643 --> 00:57:47.876
around it and he looks scarred and weathered and
he says, "I've traveled this land quite a bit and

00:57:47.876 --> 00:57:53.971
"I've heard there's roving bands of goliaths been
attacking folks up north in trade routes. Haven't

00:57:53.971 --> 00:58:01.158
"seen any near Emon. Where occasionally you'd hear of
the mountain-folks staying up north, it appears

00:58:01.158 --> 00:58:06.908
"they're getting brazen, wandering southward.
Haven't seen them myself, but a friend of mine had

00:58:07.074 --> 00:58:12.300
"an encounter once. Lost half his traveling crew.
Had to bury them out there. It was terrible."

00:58:12.300 --> 00:58:16.870
SAM: Sounds awful. You said up north, how far?

00:58:16.870 --> 00:58:22.805
MATT: "Just in the Silvercoat Runway. The way
south of Kraghammer, on the way to Westruun."

00:58:22.805 --> 00:58:26.040
SAM: All right. Anything else you'd like to know,
Grog?

00:58:26.040 --> 00:58:27.926
TRAVIS: No, Killer.

00:58:27.926 --> 00:58:31.518
SAM: Thank you for your troubles. Here, let me buy
you a drink.

00:58:31.518 --> 00:58:36.617
MATT: "All right, I'll take that." And he goes
over, walks with you to the bar, toss him a gold,

00:58:36.617 --> 00:58:44.862
he gets his ale, and, "You know, I've always shat
on gnomes, but today I think you've represented

00:58:44.862 --> 00:58:46.065
"them well."

00:58:46.065 --> 00:58:48.227
SAM: You, my friend, have good taste.

00:58:48.227 --> 00:58:51.530
TRAVIS: That was awesome.

00:58:51.530 --> 00:58:55.981
I had no idea. That was amazing, Scanlan.

00:58:56.033 --> 00:59:00.960
SAM: For you, anything. Hey, grow a beard tomorrow
morning.

00:59:00.960 --> 00:59:03.150
TRAVIS: Okay.

00:59:03.150 --> 00:59:11.015
MATT: All right, so. We'll say over the period of
two days go by-- Grog,

00:59:11.015 --> 00:59:12.830
what's the percentage on your--

00:59:12.830 --> 00:59:14.718
TRAVIS: 50% chance.

00:59:14.718 --> 00:59:16.826
MATT: Go ahead and roll a percentile dice.

00:59:16.826 --> 00:59:18.352
SAM: Oh, we've never done one of those before.

00:59:18.352 --> 00:59:19.326
LAURA: Oh, percentile dice!

00:59:19.326 --> 00:59:20.201
TRAVIS: That a 20?

00:59:20.201 --> 00:59:21.149
LAURA: No, a percentile dice.

00:59:21.149 --> 00:59:22.095
SAM: No, it's a percentile dice.

00:59:22.095 --> 00:59:24.252
MATT: It's two ten-siders. There should be one
that has double-digits and one that has single.

00:59:24.252 --> 00:59:26.523
TRAVIS: Both of them?

00:59:26.523 --> 00:59:27.361
MATT: Yeah.

00:59:27.361 --> 00:59:28.363
SAM: No, just one.

00:59:28.363 --> 00:59:30.618
TRAVIS: 60?

00:59:30.618 --> 00:59:32.057
MATT: 60, then roll another one.

00:59:32.057 --> 00:59:33.086
SAM: Oh.

00:59:33.086 --> 00:59:36.713
TRAVIS: Double zeroes.

00:59:36.713 --> 00:59:39.042
LAURA: 100, that's a 100.

00:59:39.042 --> 00:59:43.761
MATT: Right, well that was a 60 and then that was
for the second digit, so you rolled a 60.

00:59:43.761 --> 00:59:44.928
TRAVIS: Okay, good.

00:59:44.928 --> 00:59:49.778
MATT: All right, so, over the period of the next
morning you wake up excited and check... smooth as

00:59:49.778 --> 00:59:50.973
a baby's bum.

00:59:50.973 --> 00:59:52.859
TRAVIS: Shit.

00:59:52.859 --> 01:00:00.060
MATT: However, as the two-day period comes to an
end, you guys acquire, early in the morning that

01:00:00.060 --> 01:00:07.024
morning as you finish your breakfast, a messenger
comes to the front of Greyskull Keep and delivers

01:00:07.094 --> 01:00:11.659
a summons to the Council of Tal'Dorei that
notifies you that the package has arrived at the

01:00:11.659 --> 01:00:18.313
Council. Very very quick, to the point words, not
very verbose, in the idea of keeping it vague and

01:00:18.313 --> 01:00:19.806
secret, but you know what it means.

01:00:19.806 --> 01:00:21.700
SAM: Do you think it's the model plane I ordered?

01:00:21.700 --> 01:00:23.044
LAURA: I think it is, yes.

01:00:23.044 --> 01:00:24.359
TRAVIS: Probably not.

01:00:24.359 --> 01:00:25.602
SAM: Oh.

01:00:25.602 --> 01:00:27.062
TRAVIS: Just a guess, though.

01:00:27.062 --> 01:00:29.460
LAURA: Well, should we go?

01:00:29.460 --> 01:00:33.026
MATT: So mark down that you spent two of four days
of enchanting on that second earring, and you can

01:00:33.026 --> 01:00:37.940
get back to that if you manage to find yourself to
some sort of a laboratory elsewhere, or you can

01:00:37.940 --> 01:00:39.481
return to your--

01:00:39.481 --> 01:00:44.447
ORION: Can we stop at-- is Allura, is she here or
not?

01:00:44.447 --> 01:00:45.641
TRAVIS: Allura?

01:00:45.641 --> 01:00:49.161
MATT: Allura? She might be in the Cloudtop
District in her tower. You can inquire.

01:00:49.161 --> 01:00:52.950
ORION: And do we-- does she have helpers there,
when we were there, do you remember?

01:00:52.950 --> 01:00:54.132
MATT: No, she was just herself.

01:00:54.132 --> 01:00:55.068
ORION: It was just herself?

01:00:55.068 --> 01:00:56.362
MATT: She runs it herself.

01:00:56.362 --> 01:00:57.439
ORION: Okay.

01:00:57.439 --> 01:01:00.877
SAM: In the last two days, have I gone back to
Gilmore to pick up my item?

01:01:00.877 --> 01:01:02.837
MATT: You got back, your item was completed.

01:01:02.837 --> 01:01:04.000
SAM: Excellent.

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:07.930
ASHLEY: What kind of potion did you get?

01:01:07.930 --> 01:01:16.309
SAM: It's a potion that, when combined with-- when
consumed, can allow me to leave a mark of some

01:01:16.364 --> 01:01:27.865
sort that possibly I could use to have visions of
what is in the area. The mechanics of which I

01:01:27.865 --> 01:01:30.948
would not like to get into at this moment.

01:01:30.948 --> 01:01:36.283
MATT: So he gives you the potion. "It was a
curious endeavor, but I think you'll be happy with

01:01:36.283 --> 01:01:37.422
"the results."

01:01:37.422 --> 01:01:38.771
LAURA: It's so he can spy on you.

01:01:38.771 --> 01:01:41.265
SAM: Any chance to talk to you, Gilmore, leaves me
happy beyond compare.

01:01:41.265 --> 01:01:44.019
MATT: "Oh, stop it, flattery will get you
everywhere."

01:01:44.019 --> 01:01:46.744
TRAVIS: If you have an erection for more than 24
hours...

01:01:46.744 --> 01:01:52.480
LAURA: Did you get that potion so you can spy on
Pike when she's naked?

01:01:52.480 --> 01:02:00.485
SAM: I am offended, and terrified at the
assumption that I would sink so low!

01:02:00.485 --> 01:02:01.739
LAURA: Yeah, yeah.

01:02:01.739 --> 01:02:14.671
SAM: As to spy on my good friend and future wife
Pike when her pantaloons are down. Not at all. How

01:02:14.739 --> 01:02:22.077
dare you. How dare you! Have I ever spied?

01:02:22.077 --> 01:02:23.022
LAURA: Yes.

01:02:23.022 --> 01:02:24.730
SAM: On a member of our current party?

01:02:24.730 --> 01:02:25.756
LAURA: Yes, you have.

01:02:25.756 --> 01:02:26.530
ASHLEY: Yes.

01:02:26.530 --> 01:02:27.277
ORION: No.

01:02:27.277 --> 01:02:28.094
SAM: Current party.

01:02:28.094 --> 01:02:29.306
LAURA: Yes.

01:02:29.306 --> 01:02:30.591
SAM: Okay. Okay.

01:02:30.591 --> 01:02:32.016
(laughter)

01:02:32.016 --> 01:02:37.254
TRAVIS: Tiberius, can you bamf us to the place?

01:02:37.254 --> 01:02:38.795
SAM: I just wanted to make sure you remembered.

01:02:38.795 --> 01:02:39.740
LAURA: Good, I do.

01:02:39.740 --> 01:02:44.991
ORION: It doesn't work like that. I can bamf us
back here when we're done.

01:02:44.991 --> 01:02:48.947
MATT: All right, so you've acquired your potion,
it's a brackish purple color; it's a purple-grey.

01:02:48.947 --> 01:02:53.371
SAM: Purple-grey. Okay. I've got it. Great, thank
you.

01:02:53.371 --> 01:03:00.266
MATT: You go back to Karin and indeed the armor is
completed. It's interesting, it makes Trinket look

01:03:00.266 --> 01:03:01.661
like a roly-poly, almost.

01:03:01.661 --> 01:03:03.150
ALL: Ooh!

01:03:03.150 --> 01:03:04.296
LAURA: Oh, that's so cute!

01:03:04.296 --> 01:03:10.755
MATT: It's these overlaid giant grey scales that
overlap in armored sections and you would imagine,

01:03:10.806 --> 01:03:14.634
if you wanted-- could roll in a ball and she would
look adorable. He would. But yeah,

01:03:14.634 --> 01:03:16.022
it's, the armor--

01:03:16.022 --> 01:03:18.070
LAURA: You really, really want Trinket to be a
girl.

01:03:18.070 --> 01:03:23.564
MATT: I don't know why I've got it in my head, I
don't. You know what it is? It's because my bird I

01:03:23.564 --> 01:03:26.083
thought was a boy for the longest time, and we
found out the bird was a girl, and so I got used

01:03:26.083 --> 01:03:28.829
to transitioning to she when I talk about animals
since then. I apologize.

01:03:28.829 --> 01:03:30.206
LAURA: Oh, I see. Understandable.

01:03:30.206 --> 01:03:31.222
MATT: Trinket is a boy.

01:03:31.222 --> 01:03:35.618
LAURA: Boy. And maybe he could roll into things
now! It'll be awesome.

01:03:35.618 --> 01:03:36.756
MARISHA: Yeah, can he roll?

01:03:36.756 --> 01:03:38.387
MATT: We'll try it if you want to?

01:03:38.387 --> 01:03:40.333
MARISHA: Roly-poly bear.

01:03:40.333 --> 01:03:42.127
MATT: Bears aren't known for their rolling
capabilities.

01:03:42.127 --> 01:03:43.765
LAURA: Trinket is a special bear.

01:03:43.765 --> 01:03:47.858
ORION: How much does Trinket weigh again? Like 600
pounds?

01:03:47.858 --> 01:03:49.230
LAURA: He weighs a lot.

01:03:49.230 --> 01:03:51.287
TALIESIN: Call it a "bear-rel" roll.

01:03:51.287 --> 01:03:56.592
ORION: He's not over a thousand pounds though. Is it
800 pounds?

01:03:56.592 --> 01:03:58.852
MATT: Trinket's pushing about 800 pounds,
probably.

01:03:58.852 --> 01:04:00.270
ORION: He's 800 pounds, so.

01:04:00.270 --> 01:04:01.493
LAURA: He weighs more than Grog.

01:04:01.493 --> 01:04:03.238
ORION: I can fastball special him.

01:04:03.238 --> 01:04:05.937
LAURA: (gasps) Fastball special Trinket.

01:04:05.937 --> 01:04:14.177
MATT: So the benefits of this. Trinket acquires an
additional plus two to Trinket's armor class over

01:04:14.261 --> 01:04:17.285
his previous armor, which he gains from the
bulette.

01:04:17.285 --> 01:04:18.928
LAURA: That puts him at 20.

01:04:18.928 --> 01:04:30.225
MATT: That's fantastic. Also, Trinket has
resistance against non-magical bludgeoning

01:04:30.225 --> 01:04:31.504
damage.

01:04:31.504 --> 01:04:34.035
LAURA: Awesome.

01:04:34.035 --> 01:04:37.705
MATT: So if anyone attempts to go after Trinket
with a giant hammer or you know something that is

01:04:37.705 --> 01:04:38.725
bludgeon-type damage--

01:04:38.725 --> 01:04:39.900
ORION: Or a mace.

01:04:39.900 --> 01:04:41.711
MATT: -- or a giant mace, anything. If I ever
attack Trinket with something that seems

01:04:41.711 --> 01:04:45.819
bludgeoning and you say, ah-ah, is that
bludgeoning? Call me on it and it could be reduced

01:04:45.819 --> 01:04:47.027
by half.

01:04:47.027 --> 01:04:48.136
SAM: What if someone tries to--

01:04:48.136 --> 01:04:49.910
LAURA: So if I did try to roll him into something
it wouldn't hurt him--

01:04:49.910 --> 01:04:50.976
MATT: Not as much.

01:04:50.976 --> 01:04:52.564
LAURA: -- because that would technically be
bludgeoning.

01:04:52.564 --> 01:04:53.762
MATT: In theory, yeah.

01:04:53.835 --> 01:04:54.596
LAURA: Okay.

01:04:54.596 --> 01:04:55.821
MATT: Hitting the wall, Trinket would be like,
"All right."

01:04:55.821 --> 01:04:57.587
SAM: What if someone tried to hit Trinket with a
salmon?

01:04:57.587 --> 01:04:58.756
ORION: That's also bludgeoning.

01:04:58.756 --> 01:05:04.108
MATT: That's fish damage, it's a different arcane
type of damage. Fire, lightning, fish, it's a

01:05:04.108 --> 01:05:05.320
whole thing.

01:05:05.320 --> 01:05:09.368
LAURA: Let's go see the Council.

01:05:09.368 --> 01:05:11.508
SAM: Let's go. All right. To the Council!

01:05:11.508 --> 01:05:13.460
MARISHA: Did I learn anything from my herbalism
book?

01:05:13.519 --> 01:05:21.461
MATT: What the books are is you keep them with
you, and if you wish to reference them while

01:05:21.461 --> 01:05:26.709
taking any sort of herbalism roll, they will
essentially give you a momentary bonus to it. They

01:05:26.709 --> 01:05:31.222
will double your proficiency bonus for any rolls
for herbalism or to harvest

01:05:31.222 --> 01:05:33.002
any pieces of a creature.

01:05:33.002 --> 01:05:34.081
MARISHA: Dope.

01:05:34.081 --> 01:05:35.827
MATT: So keep that in mind.

01:05:35.827 --> 01:05:36.950
TRAVIS: Dope.

01:05:36.950 --> 01:05:37.996
MARISHA: Dope.

01:05:37.996 --> 01:05:39.978
SAM: All right.

01:05:39.978 --> 01:05:41.287
TRAVIS: So let's go.

01:05:41.287 --> 01:05:42.553
SAM: Let's go to the Council.

01:05:42.553 --> 01:05:44.169
MATT: Are you proficient in herbalism?

01:05:44.169 --> 01:05:44.989
MARISHA: Huh?

01:05:44.989 --> 01:05:49.669
MATT: Are you proficient in herbalism? Or medicine
I guess it would be now, sorry. Herbalism is,

01:05:49.669 --> 01:05:51.902
sorry, that's old systems.

01:05:51.902 --> 01:05:53.821
MARISHA: I mean, I'm proficient in nature.

01:05:53.821 --> 01:05:59.927
MATT: We'll say nature, it'd be nature. I've run
too many systems. Too many games. So we'll say,

01:05:59.927 --> 01:06:01.727
are you proficient in nature?

01:06:01.727 --> 01:06:03.199
MARISHA: Yeah. Druid, yo.

01:06:03.199 --> 01:06:06.516
MATT: So you double your proficiency bonus on any
nature rolls to do either of those things.

01:06:06.570 --> 01:06:07.637
MARISHA: Okay.

01:06:07.637 --> 01:06:12.311
MATT: Keep that in mind. All right. So. You guys
head to the Cloudtop District towards the palace

01:06:12.311 --> 01:06:16.392
in the center. You were about to say something,
Orion?

01:06:16.392 --> 01:06:18.238
ORION: Nope.

01:06:18.238 --> 01:06:20.237
MATT: Do you want to talk to Allura while you're
here, or not?

01:06:20.237 --> 01:06:23.860
ORION: No.

01:06:23.860 --> 01:06:25.457
MATT: Okay.

01:06:25.457 --> 01:06:28.402
LIAM: You should talk to her. Talk to her.

01:06:28.402 --> 01:06:30.623
ORION: She has no interest in me.

01:06:30.623 --> 01:06:32.339
LAURA: She looks really pretty today, Tiberius.

01:06:32.339 --> 01:06:34.109
TRAVIS: She won't have any interest if you don't
talk to her.

01:06:34.109 --> 01:06:35.966
ASHLEY: It looks like she put some lip stuff on.

01:06:35.966 --> 01:06:39.039
ORION: I'm sure Lady Kima can satisfy any needs
she has.

01:06:39.039 --> 01:06:42.151
LAURA: I think they're just friends, darling.

01:06:42.151 --> 01:06:45.488
LIAM: You don't want to look back and regret what
you didn't say.

01:06:45.488 --> 01:06:49.779
TRAVIS: (sings) Say what you need to say.

01:06:49.779 --> 01:06:52.380
ASHLEY: (sings) Say what you need to say.

01:06:52.380 --> 01:06:53.917
TALIESIN: Listen to the tiny disembodied head.

01:06:53.917 --> 01:06:54.933
MARISHA: (laughs) Yeah.

01:06:54.933 --> 01:06:56.330
ORION: We can stop by there, okay. I only have a
question.

01:06:56.330 --> 01:07:00.439
MATT: It's nearly across the street from the
palace. So you head to the ivory tower, you go

01:07:00.439 --> 01:07:04.471
ahead and you take the giant circular knocker on
the door, hit it a couple times, eventually Allura

01:07:04.605 --> 01:07:09.290
comes, this time in what looks like more
comfortable robes. She was caught off-guard. She

01:07:09.290 --> 01:07:16.266
has like a terry cloth or some sort of big fuzzy
material, her hair's a bit in disarray. She opens

01:07:16.266 --> 01:07:22.214
the door. "Oh. Hello. Greetings, I'm sorry, I
wasn't expecting company."

01:07:22.214 --> 01:07:23.915
MARISHA: What time is it?

01:07:23.915 --> 01:07:29.022
MATT: At this point in time it's probably about,
I'd say, 11 in the morning.

01:07:29.022 --> 01:07:30.623
LAURA: Oh, she's a late sleeper, I like it.

01:07:30.623 --> 01:07:32.094
MARISHA: On like a Sunday?

01:07:32.094 --> 01:07:33.344
MATT: Sure.

01:07:33.344 --> 01:07:34.597
MARISHA: Roughly.

01:07:34.597 --> 01:07:35.941
MATT: Roughly, yeah.

01:07:35.941 --> 01:07:36.962
MARISHA: Okay.

01:07:36.962 --> 01:07:47.275
ORION: We were about to depart on another
adventure and whatnot, and I was working on an

01:07:47.275 --> 01:07:50.661
enchantment on this particular-- I'll show her
what it is.

01:07:50.661 --> 01:07:52.405
MATT: "Oh yes, yes, of course."

01:07:52.405 --> 01:07:57.633
ORION: It's an enchantment that's easily, you
know, finished enough. I was wondering if in our

01:07:57.633 --> 01:08:02.487
absence, in your spare time you could probably put
some time into finishing the enchantment whilst

01:08:02.487 --> 01:08:04.356
we're away.

01:08:04.356 --> 01:08:10.606
MATT: "That should not be a problem. I was
intending to complete the circle of teleportation

01:08:10.674 --> 01:08:14.038
"markings that I had promised you for your Keep in
your absence. So."

01:08:14.038 --> 01:08:16.538
ORION: Oh! Just waiting there as well.

01:08:16.538 --> 01:08:18.073
MATT: "I could do both while I'm there."

01:08:18.073 --> 01:08:19.274
ORION: Thank you so much, Allura.

01:08:19.274 --> 01:08:20.436
MATT: "It would be my pleasure, Tiberius."

01:08:20.436 --> 01:08:32.240
ORION: It is-- (sputtering) Well. Okay. I'll bid
you farewell. And I'll do Prestidigitation

01:08:32.240 --> 01:08:39.960
(pfft)-- a local flower, I'll give to her. For
your trouble.

01:08:39.960 --> 01:08:45.905
MATT: A purple dandy, as it's called, it's like a
star-like purple flower, projects itself from your

01:08:45.905 --> 01:08:53.436
hand. You hand it to her and you see she puts her
hand in her face a second. "Thank you very much,

01:08:53.436 --> 01:08:55.101
"Tiberius, I appreciate it."

01:08:55.101 --> 01:08:56.675
ORION: You're welcome.

01:08:56.675 --> 01:09:01.316
MATT: She touches your shoulder, gives you a
smile, and then, "Best of luck. Return safely.

01:09:01.316 --> 01:09:07.247
"There is-- you've been here too short to leave so
soon, so don't stay long, please."

01:09:07.411 --> 01:09:11.883
Closes the door.

01:09:11.883 --> 01:09:14.887
LAURA: I shake his shoulders. Look at you!

01:09:14.887 --> 01:09:16.485
ORION: Who knew?

01:09:16.485 --> 01:09:20.372
LIAM: Do you want to go steady, if so check this.

01:09:20.372 --> 01:09:21.996
(laughter)

01:09:21.996 --> 01:09:24.545
ORION: Do you like me, yes, no, maybe.

01:09:24.545 --> 01:09:28.289
MATT: All right. You guys make your way to the
palace, back to the Council chambers where you met

01:09:28.289 --> 01:09:33.963
naught but two days before. The entire Council has
not been summoned to this, it's just about half of

01:09:33.963 --> 01:09:40.343
the folks there. You see the actual sovereign
Uriel is not present. The individuals that are

01:09:40.343 --> 01:09:51.411
there, however, Tofor Brotorus, the female
dragonborn paladin, is present. Seeker Asum Emring

01:09:51.411 --> 01:09:57.528
is present. They are both in the room, and you
notice this immediately as you walk into the green

01:09:57.528 --> 01:10:08.697
meeting chamber: there are two envoys that you
haven't previously met, two humans, one male and

01:10:08.697 --> 01:10:13.240
one female, dressed in silver and blue robes,
waiting patiently with their hands behind their

01:10:13.240 --> 01:10:20.445
backs, and beside them on the ground you see what
looks like a large cube about maybe two feet by

01:10:20.445 --> 01:10:29.128
two feet. It's smooth, like a chrome-like silver,
the entire construct of the cube, with two

01:10:29.128 --> 01:10:36.958
chain-link handles on each side of the box. There
is a very finely carved sapphire-inlaid patterned

01:10:37.070 --> 01:10:42.807
design all over this box. It looks very ornamental
and like it was a painstaking process to craft.

01:10:42.807 --> 01:10:50.879
You gather immediately that this probably is the
container which was sent for from Vasselheim.

01:10:50.879 --> 01:10:56.393
As you get closer, you notice the carvings almost
have a snowflake-like pattern, it's very geometric

01:10:56.393 --> 01:11:02.466
and perpetual, almost a fractal that continues
throughout the entirety of the outside of the box.

01:11:02.466 --> 01:11:09.978
It's very intricate and beautiful. As you step
into the room, immediately Tofor stands up and

01:11:10.144 --> 01:11:18.083
says, "Ah. They have arrived. Good. I'm glad you
all could make it. The envoys have arrived with

01:11:18.083 --> 01:11:27.830
"the container for the Horn. I believe they are
eager and ready to take you as their guards to see

01:11:27.830 --> 01:11:34.711
"that this evil is rid of this land forever.
Envoys." And she extends her hand.

01:11:34.711 --> 01:11:44.117
They both step forward. The man, young but very
soft in voice and very stern and military almost.

01:11:44.117 --> 01:11:53.008
"Hello. I am Scalebearer Vorak. I come under the
Platinum Dragon and will be escorted along with

01:11:53.008 --> 01:11:56.413
"you and our delivery."

01:11:56.413 --> 01:12:04.452
As he turns to the female who steps forward, she's
older, probably in her forties, long fine hair,

01:12:04.452 --> 01:12:11.127
brown, that rests just past her shoulders. Her
features are very very fine, you can see almost

01:12:11.287 --> 01:12:15.461
like there is elven blood in her but not
completely, similar to your half-elf compatriots.

01:12:15.461 --> 01:12:20.764
She steps forward, her piercing green eyes hit the
group immediately and she goes, "Hello. I am

01:12:20.764 --> 01:12:27.536
"Scalebearer Desona, also under the Platinum Dragon
and will be escorting you on this mission." They

01:12:27.536 --> 01:12:34.471
both step back towards the box in a very
ceremonial way. Everyone looks to the rest of you.

01:12:34.471 --> 01:12:40.076
SAM: Hi, nice to meet you.

01:12:40.076 --> 01:12:42.797
LAURA: I'm sorry, I was writing down your name,
Desona, what?

01:12:42.797 --> 01:12:44.187
SAM: Was it Vorak and Desona?

01:12:44.187 --> 01:12:45.410
LAURA: Desona.

01:12:45.410 --> 01:12:46.331
ORION: Hello.

01:12:46.331 --> 01:12:48.723
SAM: Lovely to meet you. I'm Scanlan, I'm sort of
the de facto leader of the group.

01:12:48.723 --> 01:12:52.276
ORION: That is not true. I am Tiberius Stormwind,
hello, nice to meet you.

01:12:52.276 --> 01:12:53.460
SAM: My second.

01:12:53.460 --> 01:12:59.214
TRAVIS: Everyone introduce yourself.

01:12:59.214 --> 01:13:04.938
TALIESIN: Oh. Percival Fredrickstein Klossowski
von Mussel de Rolo III. At your service.

01:13:04.938 --> 01:13:06.196
ORION, LAURA AND TRAVIS: You can call him
Percy.

01:13:06.196 --> 01:13:07.476
TALIESIN: They call me Percy.

01:13:07.476 --> 01:13:09.157
MATT: They look about the rest of the group.

01:13:09.157 --> 01:13:10.204
LAURA: Hello.

01:13:10.204 --> 01:13:16.200
SAM: Hi. And you'll be accompanying us on this
arduous journey to the nor-- where are we going?

01:13:16.378 --> 01:13:20.559
MATT: "Vasselheim, to the northwest, in the region
of Othanzia."

01:13:20.559 --> 01:13:22.163
LAURA: Oh, yes.

01:13:22.163 --> 01:13:26.381
MATT: "On the continent of Isilra. It's quite a
ways."

01:13:26.381 --> 01:13:28.643
LAURA: Are we taking a skyship?

01:13:28.643 --> 01:13:30.026
SAM: We're taking an airship of some sort.

01:13:30.026 --> 01:13:32.084
MATT: "Yes, a skyship is to be provided."

01:13:32.084 --> 01:13:37.871
They look at the Council, and the Council nods to
themselves and you can see Seeker Emring steps

01:13:37.871 --> 01:13:42.234
forward. "Yes, yes, a skyship will be provided,
waiting for you at the skyport here in the

01:13:42.234 --> 01:13:47.860
"Cloudtop District. We're just awaiting one more."
As he says that, the door opens again, and you can

01:13:47.860 --> 01:13:53.157
see Lady Kima steps in. No longer in the gold
armor that she had found-- scavenged from the

01:13:53.157 --> 01:13:59.368
interior, she's now dressed in proper silver and
blue inlaid plate mail.

01:13:59.368 --> 01:14:00.572
MARISHA: Who is this?

01:14:00.572 --> 01:14:01.380
LAURA: Lady Kima!

01:14:01.380 --> 01:14:02.301
MARISHA: Kima.

01:14:02.301 --> 01:14:07.987
MATT: She is wearing the same colors as the two
envoys, you can see now the silver and blue theme

01:14:08.108 --> 01:14:15.235
of Bahamut is very much on display in this
traveling crew. "Sorry I'm late, had to get

01:14:15.235 --> 01:14:16.570
"ready."

01:14:16.570 --> 01:14:19.050
LAURA: You look wonderful, Lady Kima.

01:14:19.050 --> 01:14:20.825
TRAVIS: Yeah, you look wonderful, Lady Kima.

01:14:20.825 --> 01:14:22.431
MATT: "Thank you, thank you."

01:14:22.431 --> 01:14:23.755
TALIESIN: Quite, quite.

01:14:23.755 --> 01:14:29.078
MATT: "Well, I. Do we have--" She looks about the
rest of the group with a look of somewhat kind

01:14:29.078 --> 01:14:32.798
of-- "Do we have the artifact?"

01:14:32.798 --> 01:14:34.300
LAURA: Oh.

01:14:34.300 --> 01:14:35.764
SAM: Were we supposed to bring that?

01:14:35.764 --> 01:14:37.069
TRAVIS: I have it.

01:14:37.069 --> 01:14:43.956
MATT: The two Scalebearers reach over and both at
the same time place their hands on the top of this

01:14:43.956 --> 01:14:49.284
chest. You can see their fingers slip into these
small holes on the sides and they lift, and the

01:14:49.284 --> 01:14:54.983
box scrapes with this high-pitched
metal-against-metal scraping sound, opening up a

01:14:54.983 --> 01:15:01.555
chamber on the inside. You can see the interior
also has the same similar scrolling carvings and

01:15:01.555 --> 01:15:08.201
engraving on the inside of the box that you saw on
the outside. There is a slight hum almost, like a

01:15:08.253 --> 01:15:13.378
slight vibrational sound coming from the inside of
the box. Kima looks to you guys expectantly.

01:15:13.378 --> 01:15:16.698
"Shall we place the artifact in its container?"

01:15:16.698 --> 01:15:17.893
TRAVIS: Oh, I'll get it. I reach in--

01:15:17.893 --> 01:15:19.577
LAURA: No no no, Grog Grog Grog. No.

01:15:19.577 --> 01:15:21.438
TALIESIN: No no no no. Tiberius, if you would be
so kind.

01:15:21.438 --> 01:15:22.391
LAURA: Mage Hand?

01:15:22.391 --> 01:15:25.872
ORION: Oh, yeah. I'll hold the thing up?

01:15:25.872 --> 01:15:26.654
TALIESIN: Yes.

01:15:26.654 --> 01:15:27.758
LAURA: We're putting it in the box, yeah?

01:15:27.758 --> 01:15:28.654
TALIESIN: Putting it in the box.

01:15:28.654 --> 01:15:29.838
ORION: Oh!

01:15:29.838 --> 01:15:38.396
MATT: So it takes a moment. The use of Mage Hand
in a Bag of Holding is a very meticulous process,

01:15:38.396 --> 01:15:42.347
because the Bag of Holding responds to the thought
command of what you're reaching for the moment you

01:15:42.347 --> 01:15:46.854
reach in with your physical hand. Using it as an
arcane tether it's almost like reaching through

01:15:47.003 --> 01:15:52.427
jello to get there, so you have to really
concentrate to get it through. Eventually the Mage

01:15:52.427 --> 01:15:56.619
Hand takes hold of something. You feel the
tingling of something weighty in the grasp of your

01:15:56.619 --> 01:16:05.005
arcane focus and as you lift out, there aloft you
can see the dark, twisted Horn of Orcus. As it's

01:16:05.005 --> 01:16:09.436
removed, this is the first time the Council's
really seen it at this point, and there's an

01:16:09.511 --> 01:16:13.734
audible leaving of breath in the room,
everyone at its presence.

01:16:13.734 --> 01:16:15.497
LAURA: Yeah, it's pretty horrible.

01:16:15.497 --> 01:16:16.399
ORION: Okay.

01:16:16.399 --> 01:16:18.060
TRAVIS: What?

01:16:18.060 --> 01:16:22.318
ORION: Hold on a second. We're putting this in the
container, right?

01:16:22.318 --> 01:16:23.743
TRAVIS: Yeah, the box, the magic box.

01:16:23.864 --> 01:16:24.699
LAURA: Yes.

01:16:24.699 --> 01:16:26.373
ORION: I put it inside the Bag of Holding real
quick.

01:16:26.373 --> 01:16:27.599
LAURA: Back in the Bag of Holding?

01:16:27.599 --> 01:16:36.559
ORION: Yes. I'm going to take off a tiny piece of
one of my tickets of Telescription, and I'm going

01:16:36.612 --> 01:16:45.607
to enchant it and I want to attempt to do an
enchantment spell where-- I want to put it at the

01:16:45.607 --> 01:16:47.425
bottom of where I'm going to--

01:16:47.425 --> 01:16:48.352
LAURA: The box?

01:16:48.352 --> 01:16:57.363
ORION: -- the box, and if it's, if any weight is
lifted from it, I'll know. Like, if there's the

01:16:57.363 --> 01:16:59.916
old switcheroo somehow--

01:16:59.916 --> 01:17:02.489
LIAM: God, I so wish we still had the troll dick
right now.

01:17:02.489 --> 01:17:05.436
ORION: Oh man. Because I would've used the troll
dick instead.

01:17:05.436 --> 01:17:12.930
MATT: It is already enchanted. To re-enchant it is
a difficult process, plus enchanting anything

01:17:13.159 --> 01:17:16.182
would take time. It's essentially an Alarm spell,
you could do it, but it would take

01:17:16.182 --> 01:17:17.498
probably half a day.

01:17:17.498 --> 01:17:18.515
TRAVIS: I think we can trust them.

01:17:18.515 --> 01:17:19.645
ORION: Okay.

01:17:19.645 --> 01:17:23.350
LAURA: Plus adding extra runes in there might jack
up the enchantment they already put in the box.

01:17:23.350 --> 01:17:25.127
ORION: It's a tiny piece of paper.

01:17:25.127 --> 01:17:27.172
TRAVIS: Yeah, I think we're good.

01:17:27.172 --> 01:17:29.707
ORION: But fine, if I can't do it then, I just
wanted to say.

01:17:29.707 --> 01:17:30.670
MATT: Right, it's fine.

01:17:30.670 --> 01:17:31.436
ORION: I put it in there.

01:17:31.436 --> 01:17:33.122
ASHLEY: That was a good idea.

01:17:33.122 --> 01:17:36.245
MATT: I mean, if you had an Alarm spell at your
disposal too, that would be what the enchantment's

01:17:36.245 --> 01:17:38.049
based. I don't know if you learned Alarm, did
you?

01:17:38.049 --> 01:17:39.437
ORION: Not yet.

01:17:39.437 --> 01:17:40.349
MATT: Yeah. So.

01:17:40.349 --> 01:17:41.222
ORION: It's okay.

01:17:41.222 --> 01:17:42.143
MATT: That'd be a little different.

01:17:42.143 --> 01:17:43.321
ORION: So I put it in the thing.

01:17:43.321 --> 01:17:48.900
MATT: Okay. As the Horn gets lowered into it, you
can see the runes on the inside of the box begin

01:17:48.954 --> 01:17:57.485
to glow and come to life with this soft
golden-yellow hue, and the Horn seems to be (sss)

01:17:57.485 --> 01:18:01.274
pulled into the box and held aloft in the center.
Your Mage Hand no longer has any sway on it, it is

01:18:01.274 --> 01:18:09.205
locked in place, just in the center of the box, no
seeming physical anything holding it. It's locked

01:18:09.377 --> 01:18:17.146
there. There's almost this creaking sound of air
in there fighting between cold and hot, you can

01:18:17.146 --> 01:18:22.896
hear like, (creaking), there's a small
physical battle between the temperatures as they

01:18:22.896 --> 01:18:29.475
take the lid and lift it over and seal it shut. 
The two Bearers lift the chains on

01:18:29.475 --> 01:18:32.205
the side and lift the box between the two of them.

01:18:32.205 --> 01:18:36.515
Kima looks about the rest of you. "So. Onward?"

01:18:36.515 --> 01:18:38.974
SAM: Kima, you're coming with us as well?

01:18:38.974 --> 01:18:43.522
MATT: "Damn right. I haven't been back to my
temple in quite some time. It will be good to see

01:18:43.522 --> 01:18:44.406
"Vord."

01:18:44.406 --> 01:18:47.118
ORION: Kima, I'm wondering, who do we speak to?
Who flies the ship?

01:18:47.118 --> 01:18:51.753
MATT: "I don't know. I haven't taken a skyship in
quite a while."

01:18:51.753 --> 01:18:53.154
LAURA: I'm excited!

01:18:53.154 --> 01:18:54.607
TRAVIS: I know, I've never been on one!

01:18:54.607 --> 01:18:55.799
MARISHA: I know.

01:18:55.799 --> 01:19:00.285
ORION: If we could, maybe we should ask if they
could stop at Kraghammer for a second, we could

01:19:00.285 --> 01:19:02.133
drop in and get our money really quick.

01:19:02.133 --> 01:19:05.901
TALIESIN: On the way back, I think. Once the Horn
is off the ship.

01:19:05.968 --> 01:19:07.707
LAURA: Probably best not to bring it there, yeah.

01:19:07.707 --> 01:19:09.603
ORION: You know, yeah, we can use the airship
later on for stuff.

01:19:09.603 --> 01:19:10.744
LAURA: Yeah, yeah.

01:19:10.744 --> 01:19:11.937
ORION: Which is cool.

01:19:11.937 --> 01:19:13.851
LAURA: (laughs) Which is cool.

01:19:13.906 --> 01:19:15.207
ORION: We have an airship.

01:19:15.278 --> 01:19:16.873
MARISHA: What is this airship made out of?

01:19:16.873 --> 01:19:17.875
ORION: Air and ships.

01:19:17.875 --> 01:19:18.853
LAURA: And wood and magic.

01:19:18.853 --> 01:19:21.321
TRAVIS: It only floats a couple feet off the ground,
it's not that big of a deal.

01:19:21.435 --> 01:19:27.517
SAM: I pull Vex aside for one second.

01:19:27.517 --> 01:19:28.428
LAURA: Me?

01:19:28.428 --> 01:19:34.651
SAM: Yes. Before we go on this quick journey. We
trust all the people who are sending this along

01:19:34.651 --> 01:19:37.343
this journey, right? We trust the Council?

01:19:37.343 --> 01:19:43.502
LAURA: I believe so. I mean, we did a few insight
type things last time, but I mean,

01:19:43.520 --> 01:19:44.811
we can do some more.

01:19:44.811 --> 01:19:45.687
SAM: No no no.

01:19:45.687 --> 01:19:47.193
ASHLEY: (quietly) But what about the... they sent
the new guards.

01:19:47.193 --> 01:19:48.092
SAM: Huh?

01:19:48.092 --> 01:19:52.222
LAURA: I think we should definitely talk up the
new guards and see what kind of people they are

01:19:52.222 --> 01:19:55.052
when we're on our way to the ship, how about
that?

01:19:55.116 --> 01:19:56.314
SAM: All right. Good to go.

01:19:56.314 --> 01:19:58.926
TRAVIS: Brother on the guy, sister on the girl?

01:19:58.926 --> 01:20:01.071
LAURA: Or Scanlan on one.

01:20:01.071 --> 01:20:02.132
TRAVIS: Oh.

01:20:02.132 --> 01:20:03.437
SAM: I'll take the girl.

01:20:03.437 --> 01:20:04.734
LAURA: I'll take the guy.

01:20:04.734 --> 01:20:07.070
TALIESIN: Oh dear.

01:20:07.070 --> 01:20:12.881
MATT: All right. You guys make your way out of the
palace towards the northwestern side of the

01:20:12.953 --> 01:20:21.031
Cloudtop District, and what you've seen is there
is one thicker tower that is part of the wall that

01:20:21.031 --> 01:20:24.836
surrounds the Cloudtop District, what is
essentially the bastion of defense for the inner

01:20:24.836 --> 01:20:28.561
part of the city. There are these small pillars
that hold up the wall, there is one that's very

01:20:28.561 --> 01:20:33.025
thick, and you've seen only a couple of skyships
travel to and from, you don't see them in use very

01:20:33.025 --> 01:20:39.232
often. Usually for very specific modes of travel
or reasonings are these employed. But you can see

01:20:39.232 --> 01:20:44.243
this large tower that has a spiral staircase in
the interior that occasionally lets out to these

01:20:44.243 --> 01:20:50.918
small windows across the entire length of it as it
rises up hundreds of feet to the very top of the

01:20:50.918 --> 01:20:55.989
tower that surrounds this district. On the top you
can see there is a platform that extends outward

01:20:55.989 --> 01:21:02.015
on both sides of the wall and you can just barely
make out the top of what looks like some sort of

01:21:02.015 --> 01:21:03.895
construct there.

01:21:03.895 --> 01:21:11.849
As you make your way, following Kima up the long
spiral staircase, eventually though it seems way

01:21:11.899 --> 01:21:19.285
too long to be traveling up a very thick spiral
staircase, you come to what looks like a trapdoor,

01:21:19.285 --> 01:21:23.985
almost, like a wooden trapdoor. Kima (hrah) lifts
it over (ting ting), you can hear it slap on the

01:21:23.985 --> 01:21:27.988
other side, some of the chains clinking against
the stonework, and daylight comes careening into

01:21:27.988 --> 01:21:32.137
this spiral staircase. You all step out to the top
and immediately are hit with the wind. This high

01:21:32.137 --> 01:21:35.552
up, there's definitely a breeze that blows
through, your hair being tossed a bit.

01:21:35.552 --> 01:21:38.507
(laughter)

01:21:38.507 --> 01:21:39.405
ASHLEY: Whoa!

01:21:39.405 --> 01:21:40.842
LAURA: This is crazy!

01:21:40.842 --> 01:21:42.256
TRAVIS: I'm bald.

01:21:42.256 --> 01:21:51.336
MATT: You see roughly five individuals standing,
all in gold and white armor of various types, and

01:21:51.336 --> 01:21:57.789
they are seemingly employees. They are currently
standing, waiting for you. There is one individual

01:21:57.789 --> 01:22:03.221
that is more adorned in what looks like a
captain's uniform, if you will, and above them,

01:22:03.221 --> 01:22:08.537
with a bunch of ropes hanging from the sides of
it, you can see what looks like a large,

01:22:08.537 --> 01:22:15.339
beautifully crafted wooden ship that has golden
scrolling, this beautiful elven-like golden

01:22:15.339 --> 01:22:22.130
scrolling across the entire underside of this
wooden ship. You don't see propellers, you see

01:22:22.130 --> 01:22:26.901
what looks like two almost wing-like protrusions
on the sides of it, almost like two fans that open

01:22:26.901 --> 01:22:33.575
up that are probably used to guide pitch. At the
very front of it, you can see what looks to be in

01:22:33.575 --> 01:22:41.250
the center of the ship one large ten to 15
foot-wide blue crystal that is embedded in the

01:22:41.250 --> 01:22:46.858
front of the ship and on the back two more that
are currently attached to the back side. These

01:22:46.858 --> 01:22:52.330
stones slowly rotate in place where they are, and
you can see there's this slight hum of arcane

01:22:52.330 --> 01:22:56.963
energy that seems to emanate from them. You can
immediately gather that these three blue stones

01:22:56.963 --> 01:23:03.523
are what holds the ship aloft. Silent and
beautiful.

01:23:03.523 --> 01:23:04.893
LAURA: Awesome!

01:23:04.893 --> 01:23:11.424
MATT: As you guys begin to walk up towards this
ship, looming about 15 or 20 feet in the air, the

01:23:11.492 --> 01:23:15.044
individuals in front of you all of a sudden glance
over and notice, and the captain steps forward,

01:23:15.044 --> 01:23:20.783
reaches out his hand. "Hi. I'm glad you could
finally make it. We've been waiting for a good 30

01:23:20.783 --> 01:23:26.987
"minutes. I'm Captain Damon, I would like to
welcome you aboard the skyship Deera. We are

01:23:26.987 --> 01:23:30.987
"traveling across the ocean, it's approximately a
week's worth of travel. We have provisions

01:23:30.987 --> 01:23:34.534
"provided for you. Do you have any questions?"

01:23:34.534 --> 01:23:36.764
LAURA: Captain Damon?

01:23:36.764 --> 01:23:38.062
MATT: "Yes?"

01:23:38.062 --> 01:23:39.802
LAURA: Just making sure I got your name.

01:23:39.802 --> 01:23:41.551
MARISHA: And like Skipper Veera? Who was?

01:23:41.551 --> 01:23:43.373
SAM: Airship. The airship's called Deera. Deera?

01:23:43.373 --> 01:23:44.430
MATT: Deera.

01:23:44.430 --> 01:23:45.920
MARISHA: Oh, the airship.

01:23:45.920 --> 01:23:53.562
ASHLEY: I go up to Captain Damon and I put out my
hand and I say, "Captain Damon, it is a very--

01:23:53.562 --> 01:23:55.596
"pleasure is all mine."

01:23:55.596 --> 01:23:56.972
MATT: Sturdy shake.

01:23:56.972 --> 01:24:02.940
ASHLEY: I was a deckhand on the Broken Howl and we
heard of many adventures that you had, and maybe

01:24:02.940 --> 01:24:05.510
you've heard of the Broken Howl, maybe you
haven't, but--

01:24:05.594 --> 01:24:07.151
MATT: "No, but I'm willing to hear."

01:24:07.151 --> 01:24:09.881
ASHLEY: It's a pleasure to ride on an airship, so
thanks.

01:24:09.881 --> 01:24:14.678
MATT: "Oh, it's a pleasure to have you. Keep
everything away from the sides."

01:24:14.678 --> 01:24:20.949
MARISHA: I was about to say, I run over to the
side and look over the edge before he says that.

01:24:20.949 --> 01:24:23.391
MATT: You guys are still on the platform, he
hasn't led you up to the ship yet.

01:24:23.391 --> 01:24:25.817
MARISHA: Does the platform have like a ledge I can
look over?

01:24:25.817 --> 01:24:26.815
MATT: Yeah.

01:24:26.815 --> 01:24:27.777
MARISHA: Like the Empire State Building?

01:24:27.777 --> 01:24:28.765
MATT: Yeah, you can do that.

01:24:28.765 --> 01:24:29.727
MARISHA: I want to do that.

01:24:29.727 --> 01:24:33.796
MATT: Okay, as you do that, "You really shouldn't
do-- she shouldn't do that."

01:24:33.796 --> 01:24:35.293
MARISHA: Guys, this is really high!

01:24:35.293 --> 01:24:36.668
MATT: "She really shouldn't do that, I don't--"

01:24:36.668 --> 01:24:37.724
LAURA: Keyleth, it's really windy!

01:24:37.724 --> 01:24:38.865
TALIESIN: It's all right, she can fly.

01:24:38.865 --> 01:24:40.784
TRAVIS: I run up behind her and I grab her
shoulders to scare her.

01:24:40.784 --> 01:24:41.960
MARISHA: I climb up on the ledge.

01:24:41.960 --> 01:24:45.320
MATT: Okay, as you're climbing up on the ledge,
Grog comes over and goes, "Boo!" and shoves you

01:24:45.320 --> 01:24:47.788
and gives you a scare.

01:24:47.850 --> 01:24:50.584
MARISHA: Grog!

01:24:50.584 --> 01:24:53.373
TRAVIS: Did you pee a little?

01:24:53.373 --> 01:24:54.870
MARISHA: A little bit.

01:24:54.870 --> 01:24:57.414
MATT: At which point you can see the captain's
like (panting).

01:24:57.414 --> 01:24:59.166
LAURA: Don't worry, Captain Damon, they're--

01:24:59.166 --> 01:25:00.282
MARISHA: Guys, guys you should try--

01:25:00.282 --> 01:25:01.376
ASHLEY: She can fly.

01:25:01.376 --> 01:25:05.545
MARISHA: Grog, hold the edge of my shirt, I want
to feel like I'm flying for a second.

01:25:05.770 --> 01:25:06.673
TRAVIS: Okay.

01:25:06.673 --> 01:25:07.805
MARISHA: Woo-hoo-hoo!

01:25:07.805 --> 01:25:11.288
MATT: "If we could all please make our way to the
ship, we will leave post-haste."

01:25:11.288 --> 01:25:13.301
MARISHA: Guys, you should try this!

01:25:13.301 --> 01:25:17.688
MATT: He slowly facepalms and glances sidelong to
you and goes, "A week. We have a week."

01:25:17.688 --> 01:25:18.800
LAURA: A week. Yes.

01:25:18.800 --> 01:25:20.116
MATT: "All right."

01:25:20.116 --> 01:25:22.718
LIAM: You have flown before. You do remember that,
right?

01:25:22.718 --> 01:25:24.212
MARISHA: I know, but I'm always an animal.

01:25:24.212 --> 01:25:29.280
ORION: That's true. As they're doing this, I want
to go to the opposite end so I can get like--

01:25:29.280 --> 01:25:34.492
because this is beautiful, and I want to hold out
my staff and I--

01:25:34.492 --> 01:25:36.098
LAURA: Are you going to take a selfie?

01:25:36.098 --> 01:25:37.979
ORION: And I'm going to cast Image Capture--

01:25:37.979 --> 01:25:39.234
ASHLEY: Selfie staff.

01:25:39.234 --> 01:25:40.897
SAM: Image Capture?

01:25:40.897 --> 01:25:41.896
ORION: Yes.

01:25:41.896 --> 01:25:42.871
SAM: That's a thing?

01:25:42.871 --> 01:25:44.182
ORION: It is in Draconia.

01:25:44.182 --> 01:25:45.266
MARISHA: Selfie staff!

01:25:45.266 --> 01:25:46.150
LAURA: Are we taking selfies?

01:25:46.150 --> 01:25:47.098
MARISHA: Yes, we are.

01:25:47.098 --> 01:25:49.100
ORION: Getting all of them and the airship while
they're doing it.

01:25:49.100 --> 01:25:53.514
MATT: You use your Prestidigitation to temporarily
capture an image of yourself at the edge of the

01:25:53.514 --> 01:25:54.851
top of the tower.

01:25:54.851 --> 01:25:56.093
ORION: And the airship is in it too.

01:25:56.093 --> 01:25:58.811
MATT: In doing so, the DM imposes disadvantage on
your next two rolls.

01:25:58.811 --> 01:26:00.283
ALL: Ohh!

01:26:00.283 --> 01:26:02.683
MATT: No, it's fine, it's fine.

01:26:02.683 --> 01:26:03.808
SAM: Nobody likes a selfie.

01:26:03.808 --> 01:26:05.383
MATT: I just hate selfie sticks so much.

01:26:05.383 --> 01:26:08.190
ASHLEY: Well, what about selfie staffs?

01:26:08.190 --> 01:26:09.501
LAURA: Selfie staffs, though.

01:26:09.501 --> 01:26:10.802
TRAVIS: They are the worst.

01:26:10.802 --> 01:26:11.785
MARISHA: Selfie staff.

01:26:11.785 --> 01:26:13.093
MATT: I'll let it pass. It's temporary.

01:26:13.093 --> 01:26:16.671
ORION: Look, everyone.

01:26:16.671 --> 01:26:19.557
LAURA: Oh, that's a good one, that's a really good
one.

01:26:19.625 --> 01:26:20.500
MARISHA: That's a good one.

01:26:20.500 --> 01:26:24.985
MATT: You hear this loud whistle, this
(wheee-ooo), and the captain you see is blowing on

01:26:25.049 --> 01:26:32.637
this loud metal whistle around his neck. "All
aboard! On to the Deera, folks." And everyone

01:26:32.637 --> 01:26:34.488
starts climbing up the ropes that are underneath
the ship.

01:26:34.488 --> 01:26:35.450
LAURA: Oh, ropes.

01:26:35.450 --> 01:26:39.820
ASHLEY: If you guys need any help, I can totally
help. Just so you know.

01:26:39.820 --> 01:26:41.322
ORION: (laughs) I can totally do it.

01:26:41.322 --> 01:26:47.248
SAM: Captain Damon, just morbid curiosity. Are you
married? Do you have a steady girl?

01:26:47.248 --> 01:26:58.282
MATT: He looks at you with surprise, confusion,
worry, shakes his head out of misunderstanding.

01:26:58.282 --> 01:27:00.076
"What?"

01:27:00.076 --> 01:27:03.135
SAM: Never mind, we'll talk later.

01:27:03.135 --> 01:27:09.155
MATT: "All right." He looks entirely side-blasted
by that, he was not expecting that question.

01:27:09.206 --> 01:27:15.598
Nothing negative, just really confused. So as you
all climb your way to the deck, you get on top of

01:27:15.598 --> 01:27:20.809
it and it is-- the whole deck has this strange,
slow-floating sensation and once you're on the

01:27:20.809 --> 01:27:25.566
deck you can hear this crackling hum around the
large blue stones holding it aloft.

01:27:25.566 --> 01:27:28.004
LAURA: Wait, how did Trinket get up if we had to
climb ropes?

01:27:28.004 --> 01:27:33.348
MATT: We will say (laughs) there are ways, and if
you ask this question, how'd they get Trinket up,

01:27:33.348 --> 01:27:35.470
they go ahead--

01:27:35.470 --> 01:27:36.596
ORION: Winches.

01:27:36.596 --> 01:27:37.812
LAURA: Winches.

01:27:37.812 --> 01:27:41.424
MATT: I was going to say, no, the captain gets
back on the ship, goes off to the side, and what

01:27:41.479 --> 01:27:44.068
you didn't notice on the far end of the platform
there is like a large crane-like structure.

01:27:44.068 --> 01:27:45.559
MARISHA: Cargo.

01:27:45.559 --> 01:27:49.381
MATT: They actually raise up Trinket in a small
sling-like contraption.

01:27:49.381 --> 01:27:50.586
LAURA: You're okay, darling!

01:27:50.586 --> 01:27:54.781
MATT: (worried bear noises) As Trinket's-- it was
bad enough trying to fly when you guys were in the

01:27:54.781 --> 01:27:55.518
Underdark.

01:27:55.518 --> 01:27:56.295
LAURA: Yeah.

01:27:56.295 --> 01:28:02.397
MATT: Now just paddling in the air absentmindedly
as the crane contraption brings Trinket back over

01:28:02.397 --> 01:28:06.549
and lowers him onto the deck of the airship
Deera.

01:28:06.617 --> 01:28:07.994
LAURA: All right, all right.

01:28:07.994 --> 01:28:11.512
MATT: Eventually releasing. Trinket's now on board
and looks noticeably uncomfortable and is in the

01:28:11.512 --> 01:28:12.956
center of the ship sitting down.

01:28:12.956 --> 01:28:15.527
LIAM: Does that when he's nervous. Don't mind
him, talk to him.

01:28:15.527 --> 01:28:18.528
MATT: "All right. Everyone on board?"

01:28:18.528 --> 01:28:19.328
SAM: Yes.

01:28:19.512 --> 01:28:20.279
LAURA: Yes.

01:28:20.279 --> 01:28:25.584
MATT: "All right. To your quarters underneath. We
set out now to Vasselheim." He blows his whistle a

01:28:25.584 --> 01:28:29.311
second time. All the hands separate, most of them
go underneath the deck.

01:28:29.311 --> 01:28:32.321
LAURA: Where's the box, where's the box. Are we
keeping an eye on the box?

01:28:32.321 --> 01:28:38.408
MATT: Yes, you can see now the two Scalebearers
are carrying the box underneath, and on the deck

01:28:38.408 --> 01:28:42.892
you can see there are doorways that lead into
various levels underneath the deck of the ship,

01:28:42.892 --> 01:28:47.521
there is a large cargo lattice section in the
middle of the ship where they're putting larger

01:28:47.521 --> 01:28:54.564
things down below, there is the actual wheel of
the ship is on the back end, on the elevated back

01:28:54.564 --> 01:28:58.653
end of the entire ship, and that's where the
captains stands up to as the rest of the hands

01:28:58.653 --> 01:29:00.765
bring all the ropes up from the side.

01:29:00.765 --> 01:29:05.430
LAURA: I want to stay on top, but I feel like I
should go to keep an eye on the box and see and

01:29:05.485 --> 01:29:06.773
make sure.

01:29:06.773 --> 01:29:10.280
MATT: It's up to you guys. But as the ropes are
brought up, everyone gives a thumbs-up on the

01:29:10.280 --> 01:29:18.000
sides, he reaches the front of the ship's wheel,
you see he takes something from his neck and

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:22.853
places it into the center of the wheel, at which
point the three blue stones spark with additional

01:29:22.853 --> 01:29:28.722
life. The humming gets louder, the ship lurches
for a second, and begins to lift upward with

01:29:28.722 --> 01:29:35.235
this slow, gradual sensation. All of you at once,
your stomach gets that butterfly sensation for a

01:29:35.303 --> 01:29:42.831
second, at which point the captain leans forward,
the actual wheel moves forward slightly, and the

01:29:42.831 --> 01:29:48.607
whole ship (whoosh) lurches forward, up and over
Emon, and those of you who are on the deck, you

01:29:48.607 --> 01:29:54.255
can look below you over the side, you can see the
entirety of Emon from above slowly drift away as

01:29:54.255 --> 01:30:01.790
the endless ocean of the Ozmit Sea comes towards
you, clouds ahead, beginning your trek to the

01:30:01.859 --> 01:30:03.096
distant land.

01:30:03.096 --> 01:30:05.021
SAM: I can see my Keep from here!

01:30:05.021 --> 01:30:06.133
MATT: And you can, you can.

01:30:06.133 --> 01:30:07.246
MARISHA: Can we see Castle Greyskull?

01:30:07.246 --> 01:30:09.741
MATT: You can see, it's a little blip from here and
it's slowly vanishing, but you can

01:30:09.796 --> 01:30:10.736
definitely see it.

01:30:10.736 --> 01:30:12.145
MARISHA: Hi, Greyskull Keep!

01:30:12.145 --> 01:30:13.655
TALIESIN: We've gotten to sleep there for two
days.

01:30:13.655 --> 01:30:14.397
LAURA: Oh, wow.

01:30:14.397 --> 01:30:15.497
MARISHA: I know, bye!

01:30:15.497 --> 01:30:17.973
MATT: All right, and on that note we'll go ahead
and take our bathroom break real fast,

01:30:17.973 --> 01:30:19.099
take a bio rest.

01:30:19.099 --> 01:30:20.326
TRAVIS: Five minutes?

01:30:20.326 --> 01:30:22.775
MATT: This will be about ten minutes, because I
haven't actually eaten yet either, I haven't had

01:30:22.775 --> 01:30:26.000
time to eat the wonderful food that you guys
provided. Thank you again for dinner.

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:27.420
LAURA: Oh, go get food.

01:30:27.420 --> 01:30:28.546
MARISHA: Thank you for the food, it's so good.

01:30:28.546 --> 01:30:32.273
MATT: Chat bought us an amazing spread. Uh-oh,
Overlords.

01:30:32.273 --> 01:30:33.756
ZAC: You guys can go on your break.

01:30:33.756 --> 01:30:36.135
MATT: He's got this, we'll see you guys in a moment.

01:30:36.135 --> 01:30:38.408
ZAC: I got this.

01:30:38.460 --> 01:30:39.562
MATT: All right.

01:30:39.562 --> 01:30:46.551
ZAC: I got it. Guys, we have one more Soul Hunters
key to give away, and I think we're just nine subs

01:30:46.551 --> 01:30:55.143
from that. We are nine subs away from doing
another book, signed book, and signed photo

01:30:55.143 --> 01:31:03.233
giveaway as well, and that'll, huh? Eight, now. I
stand corrected. Guys, thank you for tuning in.

01:31:03.233 --> 01:31:13.225
You can still donate to 826LA if they can post
that donation link in the chatroom for you. We

01:31:13.396 --> 01:31:19.565
will not be reading donations tonight from
anything less than $20, just so we're not here for

01:31:19.565 --> 01:31:24.574
another hour, because that's-- it's a lot of
messages, so $20 and up and we'll read it.

01:31:24.574 --> 01:31:26.743
MARISHA: We didn't plug 826 at the top, either.

01:31:26.743 --> 01:31:28.569
ZAC: We did not plug 826 at the top, so.

01:31:28.569 --> 01:31:31.553
MARISHA: So yeah, for those of you who might be
new, those of you who are veterans, you already

01:31:31.553 --> 01:31:39.944
know, but 826LA is our charity of choice. They are
a after-school non-profit program for kids K-12th

01:31:39.944 --> 01:31:45.224
grade, and they focus on creative writing and
imaginative storytelling and they're right up our

01:31:45.224 --> 01:31:51.060
alley, and they have awesome storefronts. They
have the one in Mar Vista and the one in Echo Park

01:31:51.060 --> 01:31:54.829
if you are LA local, and there's probably an 826
in your area.

01:31:54.829 --> 01:31:59.473
ZAC: Why don't you and I go film a video with them
at their storefront that we could play in the

01:31:59.473 --> 01:32:00.604
in-between parts of the show?

01:32:00.604 --> 01:32:02.885
MARISHA: Yes, we need that, I messaged them about
that and they're totally down.

01:32:02.954 --> 01:32:03.726
ZAC: Let's do it.

01:32:03.726 --> 01:32:04.563
MARISHA: So yeah.

01:32:04.563 --> 01:32:08.602
ZAC: So we'll hopefully have a video for you guys
soon that could show you a little bit about 826LA

01:32:08.602 --> 01:32:13.398
and who they are so we put a face to the
organization that you guys are donating to. The

01:32:13.398 --> 01:32:17.583
other thing I would like to say is-- Lucas, we're
200 away from 4,000?

01:32:17.583 --> 01:32:18.595
MARISHA: What what!

01:32:18.595 --> 01:32:19.551
ZAC: Right?

01:32:19.551 --> 01:32:20.857
Lucas: 207.

01:32:20.857 --> 01:32:30.822
ZAC: 207 to be technical. If we get to 4,000 subs
by the end of tonight, I will come up with

01:32:30.822 --> 01:32:36.348
something crazy, because that's a crazy goal. It's
stupid-crazy. I know there's a lot of you

01:32:36.348 --> 01:32:42.351
watching. Just so you guys know, this channel runs
off subscriptions, that is how we pay our hosts,

01:32:42.351 --> 01:32:47.912
that's how we keep the lights turned on, that is
how we do everything. We have a lot of shows on

01:32:47.912 --> 01:32:52.346
this channel, lots of different types of content.
We have shows about movies, we have shows about

01:32:52.346 --> 01:32:56.833
comic books, it's very different for a Twitch
channel. We're trying to do things a lot

01:32:56.833 --> 01:33:04.390
differently. That being said, we don't accept
donations, all donations go to charity 100%. We do

01:33:04.390 --> 01:33:09.955
not take any percentage of charity donations, so
subscriptions are the way that this channel keeps

01:33:10.123 --> 01:33:15.828
running. If you like this show, and you like our
other programming, you should subscribe, that's

01:33:15.828 --> 01:33:19.909
what keeps us going. We're trying to get to 7,000
subscribers, because that's what will make us

01:33:19.909 --> 01:33:25.525
break even and start being able to experiment with
newer and much larger programming outside of what

01:33:25.525 --> 01:33:32.057
you already see here. So if we get to 4,000 by the
end of tonight... Man, what's something crazy that

01:33:32.057 --> 01:33:36.060
I could do? What's that, Liam?

01:33:36.060 --> 01:33:37.679
LIAM: Streak!

01:33:37.679 --> 01:33:44.456
ZAC: Streak? Thanks, Liam. Yeah, that's great. Not
a good idea. We want that Twitch channel to

01:33:44.456 --> 01:33:53.589
continue on, not get shut down immediately. What
if, here's a crazy goal, because I know it's like

01:33:53.589 --> 01:34:01.557
200 away, that's almost impossible, but if we get
there, I will make, and just so you guys know, I

01:34:01.557 --> 01:34:15.136
made the Critical Role intro video, so I could
make a music video from the cast of Vox Moronica

01:34:15.185 --> 01:34:21.539
set within their world with a song that Alex, Ify
and I could come up with and then we could film a

01:34:21.539 --> 01:34:29.698
music video basically talking about our escapades
that continued on after the show the other night.

01:34:29.698 --> 01:34:36.299
That seems crazy enough, that seems crazy enough,
that's a crazy goal. It would be fun. But pretty

01:34:36.299 --> 01:34:41.091
crazy and ridiculous. So I could do that, and I
could have all of our Critical Role guests

01:34:41.091 --> 01:34:49.537
featured in the video as their characters in some
way. So 200. Piece of cake, right? Piece of cake.

01:34:49.537 --> 01:34:55.778
Yeah, we could get 200 subs. Sure. Not a problem.
Right, guys? I'm going to ask that Lucas roll a

01:34:55.778 --> 01:35:00.557
couple commercials, because those commercials help
the channel as well. And after that, we'll roll a

01:35:00.557 --> 01:35:02.875
couple of those intro videos and come right back
for you guys.

01:35:02.875 --> 01:36:13.274
[dramatic music]

01:36:14.191 --> 01:36:20.989
TRAVIS: Right, Listen up! If you have ale, then
you have a friend in Grog Strongjaw. A goliath of

01:36:20.989 --> 01:36:28.671
towering height and size, this barbarian has an
appetite for the two great loves in his life:

01:36:28.671 --> 01:36:32.626
combat, women, and ale! (chuckle)

01:36:32.626 --> 01:36:34.320
(record scratch) Wait.

01:36:34.320 --> 01:36:41.060
Easily the brains of the group, Grog is often
consulted for his vast knowledge of shapes,

01:36:41.060 --> 01:36:44.265
colors, and (chuckle) shiny things!

01:36:44.265 --> 01:36:45.977
Also ale.

01:36:45.977 --> 01:36:52.374
In his early years, armed with his two-handed
great axe, Grog often enjoyed proving his might

01:36:52.374 --> 01:36:58.918
amongst the ranks of his family's wandering herd.
But after coming upon an unsuspecting elderly

01:36:58.918 --> 01:37:07.137
gnome in the woods, he objected to the killing of
such an innocent life. A creature of impulse, Grog

01:37:07.137 --> 01:37:13.854
felt only pity for this-- well, this terrified
little thing. And his disobedience

01:37:14.027 --> 01:37:15.604
cost him dearly.

01:37:15.604 --> 01:37:24.152
Beaten bloody and banished by the herd leader, his
uncle Kevdak, Grog was abandoned and left to die,

01:37:24.152 --> 01:37:30.914
exiled from his herd. It was then that the
relative of the very gnome he fought to save,

01:37:30.914 --> 01:37:38.966
saved him. It was the kindness of a gnome cleric
named Pike that healed Grog, bringing him back

01:37:38.966 --> 01:37:44.435
from death's edge. And they have remained close
friends ever since.

01:37:44.435 --> 01:37:51.594
Most nights, Grog can be found challenging entire
taverns to wrestling matches! Ha! Or accompanying

01:37:51.594 --> 01:37:57.860
Scanlan to the nearest house where you pay for
lady favors.

01:37:57.860 --> 01:37:59.285
Also ale!

01:38:00.454 --> 01:38:05.206
MARISHA: A first impression of Keyleth would leave
you with little information on the half-elven

01:38:05.262 --> 01:38:09.469
druid. You might even think that her social
awkwardness due to her sheltered upbringing is

01:38:09.469 --> 01:38:11.191
kind of sweet. (chuckle)

01:38:11.191 --> 01:38:18.254
Of course, it would be unwise to underestimate her
based on first impressions. (thunder) Under that

01:38:18.254 --> 01:38:24.015
unintimidating petite frame is a vicious beast
waiting to be unleashed, whose natural powers have

01:38:24.015 --> 01:38:29.658
made even the fiercest of champions pee their
pants, literally! (soft chuckle)

01:38:29.658 --> 01:38:35.474
Born to the Air Tribe of the Ashari people,
Keyleth was raised with a deep love of nature and

01:38:35.474 --> 01:38:41.302
the elemental magics. It is her people's inherent
duty to protect the delicate areas in Tal'Dorei

01:38:41.302 --> 01:38:45.091
where the four elemental planes begin to bleed
with this realm.

01:38:45.091 --> 01:38:51.028
Since she was a little girl, she had quite a knack
for air manipulation and beast shaping abilities.

01:38:51.028 --> 01:38:58.694
Well, if you consider kittens and flying squirrels
to be little beasts. Which, I do. (clears throat)

01:38:58.694 --> 01:39:04.286
Anyways, it wasn't long before the headmaster of
the tribe, her father, Korren, realized her true

01:39:04.286 --> 01:39:09.355
prodigious abilities and she was inveterated to
succeed him as the next headmaster.

01:39:09.551 --> 01:39:15.719
Just like that, her jovial childhood was stripped
and replaced with endless spell memorization,

01:39:15.719 --> 01:39:21.571
teachings from ancient traditions, and exceedingly
high expectations. Every druid leader to be must

01:39:21.571 --> 01:39:27.323
embark on a journey to seek out the sister tribes in
order to introduce and establish respect amongst

01:39:27.323 --> 01:39:34.129
the fellow headmasters. They call this the
Aramente, or Noble Odyssey. When her father felt

01:39:34.129 --> 01:39:40.214
she was ready, he set her on the path to truly
discovering herself, not knowing when, or if, she

01:39:40.214 --> 01:39:41.924
will ever return.

01:39:41.924 --> 01:39:47.282
As she hiked down the mountain towards Stillben,
she meditated on the task ahead. Part of the

01:39:47.282 --> 01:39:53.833
Aramente is proving yourself a strong warrior, a
valiant protector, and a wise and compassionate

01:39:53.833 --> 01:40:02.629
leader. With this knowledge, one thought plays on
repeat in her mind: Is she even worthy?

01:40:04.380 --> 01:40:09.493
TALIESIN: Percy was the third of seven children,
born to a noble family who lived far to the north

01:40:09.536 --> 01:40:15.194
in the ancient castle of Whitestone. With so many
siblings to share the burdens of lordship, Percy

01:40:15.194 --> 01:40:19.907
turned his attentions to the sciences,
engineering, and naturalism.

01:40:19.907 --> 01:40:26.238
One day, a mysterious couple named Lord and Lady
Briarwood came to court. During a feast held in

01:40:26.238 --> 01:40:32.178
their honor, the Briarwoods violently took control
of the castle, killing or imprisoning everyone who

01:40:32.178 --> 01:40:34.327
would stand in their way.

01:40:34.327 --> 01:40:39.610
Percy awoke chained in the dungeon, only to be
freed by his younger sister. Together they fled,

01:40:39.610 --> 01:40:45.765
chased by the Briarwoods' men. As they ran,
Percy's sister took several arrows to the chest

01:40:45.765 --> 01:40:52.417
and fell. Percy kept running, eventually jumping
into a freezing river and floating unconscious to

01:40:52.417 --> 01:40:57.842
freedom. He did not remember waking up on a
fishing boat. He barely remembered the next two

01:40:57.842 --> 01:41:01.679
years, as he slowly made his way as far south as
possible.

01:41:01.679 --> 01:41:08.890
Then one night, Percy had a dream. A roaring cloud
of smoke offered him vengeance against those who

01:41:08.956 --> 01:41:16.507
destroyed his family. When he awoke, Percy began
to design his first gun. (gunshot)

01:41:18.669 --> 01:41:23.905
ASHLEY: Pike grew up on the outskirts of town, near
the Bramblewood. Her ancestors were a family of Deep

01:41:23.905 --> 01:41:30.973
Gnomes with quite an unfavorable reputation. Thievery,
destruction, and trickery left them with the curse

01:41:30.973 --> 01:41:37.852
of the last name Trickfoot. Sarenrae, the goddess of
healing and redemption, had other plans for Pike's

01:41:37.852 --> 01:41:44.284
great-great-grandfather Wilhand, who left his family
at a young age after a dream, a dream that changed

01:41:44.284 --> 01:41:50.581
the course of the Trickfoot family. Wilhand devoted
his life to Sarenrae and pledged from then on that

01:41:50.581 --> 01:41:58.167
him and his family would live a life of service and
devotion. As a child, Pike seemed to have an affinity to heal

01:41:58.167 --> 01:42:05.746
Whether it was animals, people, or even flowers, she
felt she had a purpose in making things whole that

01:42:05.746 --> 01:42:11.912
had once been broken. She studied and learned the
ways to heal through divine magic. She lived a

01:42:11.912 --> 01:42:18.731
peaceful life, quiet and simple, until one day Wilhand
was captured and almost killed by a group of goliath

01:42:18.731 --> 01:42:24.776
barbarians. One of the goliaths took a stand against
the murder of the innocent gnome, and he himself

01:42:24.776 --> 01:42:32.476
was beaten, bloodied, and left for dead, abandoned
by his herd. Wilhand went to Pike for help. She

01:42:32.476 --> 01:42:39.990
prayed and healed this barbarian as best she could,
bringing him back to life. When he awoke, she discovered

01:42:39.990 --> 01:42:47.475
his name was Grog Strongjaw. After that, they were
the best of friends, a rather unlikely pair.

01:42:47.475 --> 01:42:54.804
Little did she know that in a few years' time, Grog
would soon return the favor and bring her back from

01:42:54.804 --> 01:43:04.118
the clutches of death. After being killed in battle,
Pike felt angry. She wanted to be stronger so that it

01:43:04.118 --> 01:43:09.968
would never happen again. She spent four months at
sea, training with the men and women aboard a ship

01:43:10.021 --> 01:43:16.790
called the Broken Howl. Gripping her holy symbol
in one hand and her morningstar in the other,

01:43:16.790 --> 01:43:19.739
this time, Pike is ready.

01:43:21.143 --> 01:43:26.752
SAM: Oh, you haven't heard of Scanlan Shorthalt?
Well, gird your loins, ladies, because he has his

01:43:26.752 --> 01:43:28.123
eye on you.

01:43:28.123 --> 01:43:33.790
A talented musician, master of disguise, and
dashingly handsome in his own mind, Scanlan sings

01:43:33.790 --> 01:43:37.418
songs almost as much as he sings his own praises.

01:43:37.418 --> 01:43:43.542
Born a poor gnome, Scanlan used his endless charm
and soaring tenor voice to croon for coin and

01:43:43.542 --> 01:43:49.512
support his single mother. One day he was
discovered by a half-orc promoter, and joined Dr.

01:43:49.512 --> 01:43:54.732
Dranzel's Spectacular Traveling Troupe, where he
learned the ways of the world, and honed his

01:43:54.732 --> 01:43:58.020
skills as a bard extraordinaire.

01:43:58.020 --> 01:44:02.785
A loner much of his life, Scanlan has never quite
come to terms with the violent death of his mother

01:44:02.785 --> 01:44:08.397
at the hands of a goblin invasion. While his years
on the road provided many, shall we say,

01:44:08.450 --> 01:44:14.710
educational experiences with the opposite sex,
deep down, Scanlan yearns for the one thing he's

01:44:14.710 --> 01:44:18.394
never known: the true love of a fellow gnome.

01:44:18.394 --> 01:44:26.215
Still, Scanlan considers himself a lover first,
performer second, and fighter distant third. On

01:44:26.215 --> 01:44:31.502
the battlefield, he'll support his allies, but
rarely draws blood, unless it's to protect fellow

01:44:31.502 --> 01:44:33.023
gnome, Pike.

01:44:33.023 --> 01:44:38.828
Count on Scanlan for a hearty laugh, a rollicking
song, and a twinkle in his eye that melts hearts

01:44:38.828 --> 01:44:41.327
and makes the females swoon.

01:44:42.973 --> 01:44:50.202
ORION: Greetings and salutations. I am Tiberius
Stormwind. I hail from a town called Ty'rex,

01:44:50.202 --> 01:44:52.874
located in the heart of Draconia.

01:44:52.874 --> 01:44:58.296
From a politically respected family, at the age of
15, I succeeded in passing the Sorcerer's Rite,

01:44:58.296 --> 01:45:03.346
showing prodigy-like control of my magic. The
judges and the Draconian high council were amazed

01:45:03.346 --> 01:45:08.529
at how powerful my spells were for how long I had
been training. At 20 years old, I was the youngest

01:45:08.599 --> 01:45:13.874
appointed member of the magic guild in Draconian
history. For the next few years, I almost went mad

01:45:13.874 --> 01:45:18.112
from the malaise of being a guild member, as it's
rather boring.

01:45:18.112 --> 01:45:24.287
However, one day I happened upon a chamber, unused
for quite some time. In the room were stacks of

01:45:24.287 --> 01:45:29.313
books and maps of the surrounding cities and areas
around the known world. For months, I would

01:45:29.313 --> 01:45:32.543
frequent the chamber, and learned of artifacts
from legend.

01:45:32.543 --> 01:45:37.611
After a long period of research, I made a list of
artifacts that caught my eye. I brought these

01:45:37.611 --> 01:45:42.040
findings to the high council and was told that all
of the information in the chamber I had stumbled

01:45:42.040 --> 01:45:47.889
upon was either believed to be fiction, or
unsolvable mysteries, and hence were lost forever.

01:45:47.889 --> 01:45:50.901
I found those answers to be unacceptable.

01:45:50.901 --> 01:45:55.675
A year later, I devised a ruse and managed to
convince the city council to lend support in me

01:45:55.675 --> 01:46:00.466
leaving Draconia on a mission of peace and
diplomacy for the surrounding kingdoms, going from

01:46:00.466 --> 01:46:05.879
town to town and making friends and allies, in and
for the name of Draconia. Being a red dragonborn,

01:46:05.940 --> 01:46:11.295
I had quite the task on my hands in that respect,
but it was exactly what I needed so I could

01:46:11.295 --> 01:46:16.581
explore the world and find these artifacts, as I
felt the truth was out there.

01:46:16.581 --> 01:46:22.520
Some may describe me as buffoonish, but I say
poppycock to all that. I am much sharper than most

01:46:22.520 --> 01:46:27.949
give me credit for. I just don't pay attention to
things sometimes. I've also been known to be

01:46:27.949 --> 01:46:35.614
rather cunning, loyal, happy-go-lucky, and well,
dangerous. I can't help but show my true scales

01:46:35.614 --> 01:46:40.172
every now and then. But overall, I think I'm quite
friendly for a dragonborn!

01:46:41.922 --> 01:46:47.276
LIAM: Never entirely welcome in the company of
elves or men, Vax'ildan learned at a young age to

01:46:47.276 --> 01:46:52.327
skip past formality, preferring instead to invite
himself in your door.

01:46:52.327 --> 01:46:59.033
Along with twin sister Vex'ahlia, Vax was born by
a chance encounter between elven royalty and human

01:46:59.033 --> 01:47:04.427
peasantry. Raised by their mother in their early
years, the twins were eventually sent off to their

01:47:04.427 --> 01:47:10.240
father in the elven capital of Syngorn. But their
cool reception among the elves there never warmed,

01:47:10.321 --> 01:47:16.353
and their time in the capital didn't last. The
siblings stole away one autumn night and set out

01:47:16.353 --> 01:47:18.163
on the open road.

01:47:18.163 --> 01:47:23.460
After a few years of wandering, they eventually
decided to return to their mother, and journeyed

01:47:23.460 --> 01:47:29.664
back to the lands of their youth. But instead of
finding their childhood home, they returned to a

01:47:29.664 --> 01:47:36.162
pile of rubble. Their mother was gone, their home
burned to ash. Pressing the townspeople for

01:47:36.162 --> 01:47:46.165
answers, they learned of the day the dragon came.
(roar) With their ties all severed, Vax'ildan and

01:47:46.165 --> 01:47:49.942
his sister set out to find their fortune together
in Tal'Dorei.

01:47:49.942 --> 01:47:57.006
An outsider since birth, Vax quickly learned to
solve life's challenges in his own particular way,

01:47:57.006 --> 01:48:03.537
often by side-stepping them entirely. And when his
knack for circumventing adversity isn't enough,

01:48:03.537 --> 01:48:08.774
(knife scraping) the way of blades the elves
schooled him in more than

01:48:08.832 --> 01:48:10.698
makes up the difference.

01:48:10.698 --> 01:48:16.395
LAURA: Like so many half-elves, Vex'ahlia has
spent most of her life suffering the cool

01:48:16.395 --> 01:48:23.704
reception of a people who don't fully accept her.
Born of a human mother and an elven father who

01:48:23.704 --> 01:48:28.865
only later in life took an interest in their
existence, Vex'ahlia and her twin brother

01:48:28.865 --> 01:48:34.411
Vax'ildan quickly realized the only people they
could truly rely on in this world

01:48:34.411 --> 01:48:36.800
were each other.

01:48:36.800 --> 01:48:41.868
It was at the age of ten when the two were taken
from their mother and brought to live in Syngorn,

01:48:41.868 --> 01:48:48.689
the isolated elven city for which their father was
an ambassador. He quietly took them in, but always

01:48:48.689 --> 01:48:55.427
kept an icy distance, and after too many years of
disdainful looks, the pair decided to leave his

01:48:55.427 --> 01:48:59.194
indifference behind, and set out on their own.

01:48:59.194 --> 01:49:07.291
Vax took to the cities, stealing small trinkets
and learning the ways of the thief, while Vex kept

01:49:07.291 --> 01:49:10.619
to the woods; she preferred the isolation.

01:49:10.619 --> 01:49:18.189
Always the keen observer, she learned to hunt and
to track, to spy and to shoot. And through a

01:49:18.234 --> 01:49:24.919
series of fateful events, earned herself a
companion in the form of a bear-- her own stolen

01:49:24.919 --> 01:49:29.534
Trinket-- to fight alongside her and protect her
fiercely.

01:49:29.534 --> 01:49:35.659
Also, he is adorable, and gives expert massages.

01:49:35.659 --> 01:50:44.180
[dramatic music]

01:50:45.066 --> 01:50:50.220
MATT: Welcome back. We have eaten, we have had
drinks, we have used the restroom, and now we

01:50:50.220 --> 01:50:55.711
return to adventure. While we were gone, I hear
that there was a ridiculous thing that our

01:50:55.711 --> 01:51:00.388
wondrous Overlord put as a subscriber
opportunity.

01:51:00.388 --> 01:51:01.784
ZAC: I'm going to regret it!

01:51:01.784 --> 01:51:02.981
MARISHA: What? What happened?

01:51:02.981 --> 01:51:04.512
MATT: If we somehow get to 4,000--

01:51:04.512 --> 01:51:08.952
ZAC: We've already gotten 70 subs since
I announced it.

01:51:09.029 --> 01:51:16.429
MATT: Okay, so if we get to 4,000 subs tonight,
we're going to have Ify and people of the Vox

01:51:16.429 --> 01:51:21.868
Moronica crew, that did our quick little one-shot
at the DM episode, create a rap and shoot a music

01:51:21.868 --> 01:51:24.655
video that will include us.

01:51:24.655 --> 01:51:26.809
LIAM: Come on, guys, one time offer. You're going
to let it slip through your fingers?

01:51:26.809 --> 01:51:27.603
TALIESIN: We're going to do that?

01:51:27.603 --> 01:51:28.530
MARISHA: That'll include us?

01:51:28.530 --> 01:51:29.792
MATT: That'll include us in it some way.

01:51:29.792 --> 01:51:30.994
MARISHA: We're going to shoot a rap video?

01:51:30.994 --> 01:51:32.060
TALIESIN: We're going to shoot a rap video?

01:51:32.060 --> 01:51:33.230
MATT: If they get to 4,000--

01:51:33.230 --> 01:51:34.283
MARISHA: By the end of the show?

01:51:34.283 --> 01:51:35.405
MATT: -- subscribers, yeah, by the end of the
show.

01:51:35.405 --> 01:51:36.760
ORION: Can we do it like it's from 1993?

01:51:36.760 --> 01:51:42.366
ZAC: Oh, I'm going to do it however the
fuck I want to do it, and I can guarantee that Vox

01:51:42.366 --> 01:51:46.196
Moronica will look much better in the video than
you guys will.

01:51:46.196 --> 01:51:50.389
LAURA: Why would we agree to it?

01:51:50.389 --> 01:51:54.891
LIAM: It's just so crazy it might work.

01:51:54.891 --> 01:51:56.587
ASHLEY: (gasps) Oh! Is this a challenge?

01:51:56.587 --> 01:51:58.149
MARISHA: Oh, is this going to be like a role
reversal thing? In like an alternate universe?

01:51:58.149 --> 01:52:00.178
MATT: I think the Overlord just threw down the
gauntlet of Vox Moronica looking better than Vox

01:52:00.178 --> 01:52:01.410
Machina in the music video.

01:52:01.410 --> 01:52:02.547
LAURA: I think it's on.

01:52:02.547 --> 01:52:04.609
TALIESIN: I think he underestimates how naturally
pretty we all are.

01:52:04.664 --> 01:52:06.325
MARISHA: (laughing) Yeah.

01:52:06.325 --> 01:52:09.180
MATT: I think we're underestimating how naturally
ridiculous that crew is, so it is a good

01:52:09.180 --> 01:52:10.779
challenge. It's a tough call.

01:52:10.779 --> 01:52:13.337
LIAM: Classic dwarven fundraising technique!

01:52:13.337 --> 01:52:21.916
MATT: Thank you kindly, my dear. DM presents are
nice. It's delicious brandy, thank you.

01:52:21.916 --> 01:52:27.494
MARISHA: Oh wait, didn't we have cake? I want that
cake up in here. Are we going to wait?

01:52:27.494 --> 01:52:30.237
MATT: (sings) You want this cake? I want it! You
want this cake? I want it.

01:52:30.237 --> 01:52:31.336
LAURA: It's special.

01:52:31.336 --> 01:52:32.593
MATT: Sorry, a little internet there for you.

01:52:32.593 --> 01:52:34.099
LIAM: Make me a glass of that grog?

01:52:34.099 --> 01:52:35.942
LAURA: Nope, none for you, darling.

01:52:35.942 --> 01:52:38.349
ASHLEY: Take a sipsy?

01:52:38.349 --> 01:52:47.093
MATT: All right folks. Welcome back. Let's get
back into the swing of things. Quick reminder,

01:52:47.093 --> 01:52:53.758
every 50 subscribers we give out a signed player's
handbook and a signed cast photo. We also have the

01:52:53.758 --> 01:52:55.416
shirts for sale on the Teespring.

01:52:55.416 --> 01:52:56.244
MARISHA: Get some shirts.

01:52:56.244 --> 01:52:57.007
TALIESIN: Yes!

01:52:57.007 --> 01:52:59.216
SAM: Shirts, shirts, shirts! Two weeks and
counting. 13 days left.

01:52:59.216 --> 01:53:01.190
MARISHA: We forgot to wear one of ours, but
they're cool.

01:53:01.190 --> 01:53:02.440
ORION: Are they out now?

01:53:02.440 --> 01:53:03.184
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:53:03.184 --> 01:53:04.275
ORION: Oh, cool!

01:53:04.275 --> 01:53:05.751
MARISHA: We made those in honor of E3.

01:53:05.751 --> 01:53:09.150
MATT: Soul Hunter keys have been going away, but
for those who missed it earlier there's a new app

01:53:09.150 --> 01:53:14.598
out called Soul Hunters that I did some voices on
and if you download the game and put in the promo

01:53:14.598 --> 01:53:19.739
code "criticalrole," one word, you get a free
character that I voiced as well so check it out.

01:53:19.739 --> 01:53:20.829
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:53:20.829 --> 01:53:24.295
MARISHA: By the way, I will say, Soul Hunters is a
misleading title because that sounds dark and

01:53:24.295 --> 01:53:26.099
ominous and it's a super cute game.

01:53:26.099 --> 01:53:27.574
TRAVIS: Oh, that's a weird choice then.

01:53:27.574 --> 01:53:34.076
MARISHA: Yeah, wouldn't you think it sounds dark
and ominous? It's super cute. It's like with cute

01:53:34.076 --> 01:53:35.855
chibi RPG characters.

01:53:35.855 --> 01:53:37.578
MATT: Yeah, no, there's no more keys. It's just
the promo code you can use now.

01:53:37.578 --> 01:53:39.274
TRAVIS: Weird. Cool choice. Strange, though.

01:53:39.274 --> 01:53:40.341
MARISHA: Yeah, I know.

01:53:40.341 --> 01:53:46.611
MATT: All right, so. Returning back. You guys are
now traversing the extended Ozmit Sea towards

01:53:46.611 --> 01:53:51.543
Othanzia upon the skyship Deera.

01:53:51.543 --> 01:53:54.545
ORION: How many days away are we now?

01:53:54.545 --> 01:53:58.434
MATT: I'd say, we'll start it about two days into
the journey.

01:53:58.434 --> 01:54:00.715
TALIESIN: I'm going to spend that time reading my
book.

01:54:00.715 --> 01:54:03.112
MARISHA: Yeah, and me too. I'll read books.

01:54:03.112 --> 01:54:09.147
MATT: Okay, you guys take time studying. We'll say
you probably have a few more days of eight-hour

01:54:09.147 --> 01:54:12.979
days studying, going about eight to ten hours a
day if you want to take in the reading

01:54:12.979 --> 01:54:14.097
books you got.

01:54:14.097 --> 01:54:17.105
MARISHA: I'll also go ahead and-- oh you have this
book! Are you reading that book?

01:54:17.105 --> 01:54:18.503
TALIESIN: I'm reading that book.

01:54:18.503 --> 01:54:32.155
MARISHA: I'm going to make a few scrolls in my
time as well. What should I make scrolls for,

01:54:32.155 --> 01:54:33.931
guys? What's handy to have?

01:54:33.931 --> 01:54:38.510
SAM: Oh, well, when you made me something once
that was really cool but I think

01:54:38.510 --> 01:54:39.738
that was a spell.

01:54:39.738 --> 01:54:41.823
MARISHA: What's handy to have? Well, yeah, I can
make spells into scrolls.

01:54:41.823 --> 01:54:44.414
TRAVIS: Can you make something so that if we fall
out of the sky we don't die?

01:54:44.414 --> 01:54:46.344
SAM: Hey, you know what we always need? What we
always need?

01:54:46.344 --> 01:54:49.168
TALIESIN: Anti-petrify?

01:54:49.168 --> 01:54:52.075
SAM: How to carry Trinket on the goddamn carpet.

01:54:52.075 --> 01:54:53.024
LAURA: Oh yeah!

01:54:53.024 --> 01:54:54.538
MARISHA: Right, okay you're talking about the
Levitation and stuff.

01:54:54.538 --> 01:54:56.082
LAURA: Well, you guys can shrink him, you have
Polymorph.

01:54:56.082 --> 01:54:57.230
MARISHA: Oh yeah, that's true.

01:54:57.230 --> 01:55:00.107
SAM: Yeah, but we're always like one body short of
being able to pile onto the carpet.

01:55:00.107 --> 01:55:04.892
ASHLEY: Can't we add a little bit extra square
footage to the magic carpet?

01:55:04.963 --> 01:55:06.993
MATT: Unfortunately, it doesn't work that way.

01:55:06.993 --> 01:55:09.780
MARISHA: I'll make a Polymorph scroll and give it
to--

01:55:09.851 --> 01:55:12.789
LIAM: What about a steampunk rocket pack for the
bear?

01:55:12.789 --> 01:55:14.970
MARISHA: This isn't World of Warcraft.

01:55:14.970 --> 01:55:19.512
TALIESIN: I'm working on it. I'm working on it.
I'm working on it!

01:55:19.512 --> 01:55:20.822
ORION: How many can you make?

01:55:20.822 --> 01:55:25.951
MARISHA: Well I can make-- I just put whatever
spells I've learned for the day, I can put those--

01:55:25.951 --> 01:55:33.980
depending on the level, like a 3rd-level spell
scroll will take me four to six hours, so the

01:55:33.980 --> 01:55:39.011
higher the spell, the longer it takes. So, if I
spend two days I can probably make four scrolls?

01:55:39.011 --> 01:55:40.283
Four or five scrolls?

01:55:40.283 --> 01:55:41.999
LAURA: I like it.

01:55:41.999 --> 01:55:45.979
MARISHA: Yeah, that's some pretty good shit. So
I'll definitely make a Polymorph scroll for you.

01:55:46.040 --> 01:55:47.049
LAURA: Thank you!

01:55:47.049 --> 01:55:51.108
MATT: Let me first double-check about the time
process. Creating a scroll...

01:55:51.108 --> 01:55:55.192
MARISHA: That's the way it was in Pathfinder, I am
using Pathfinder rules.

01:55:55.192 --> 01:55:57.107
LAURA: I'm getting so many things added to my
inventory during this game.

01:55:57.107 --> 01:55:58.964
MARISHA: I know! (singing) We went shopping!

01:55:58.964 --> 01:56:04.231
LAURA: This is exciting. I got arrows, I got
scrolls. I have a question about Trinket's new armor.

01:56:04.231 --> 01:56:05.199
MATT: Yes?

01:56:05.199 --> 01:56:09.858
LAURA: It has an area for me to ride on him still,
right? Like the other armor? I forgot to mention

01:56:09.858 --> 01:56:11.977
it to her.

01:56:11.977 --> 01:56:15.317
MATT: (laughs) I mean, there's not like a saddle
or anything.

01:56:15.317 --> 01:56:18.691
LAURA: But the last one had a divot thing so I
could fit.

01:56:18.691 --> 01:56:22.836
MATT: Yeah. It's built off the design of the
original armor that you had customized so, yeah,

01:56:22.836 --> 01:56:24.401
that's still there.

01:56:24.401 --> 01:56:29.918
TRAVIS: Is there a bow on this ship? Like a front,
pointy part?

01:56:29.918 --> 01:56:31.169
MATT: Yes, there is.

01:56:31.169 --> 01:56:35.659
TRAVIS: Pike and I would like to go to the front
of the ship and I would like to stand at the front

01:56:35.659 --> 01:56:37.432
and put my arms out.

01:56:37.432 --> 01:56:38.649
ASHLEY: And I'm going to hold his waist.

01:56:38.649 --> 01:56:40.928
TRAVIS: And I'm going to shout: I'm the goliath of
the world!

01:56:40.928 --> 01:56:43.159
LIAM: Oh, he fell right off the front.

01:56:43.159 --> 01:56:44.225
TRAVIS: No I did not!

01:56:44.225 --> 01:56:46.085
(laughter)

01:56:46.085 --> 01:56:52.590
TRAVIS: Oh, thank you Pike! I feel like I'm
flying!

01:56:52.590 --> 01:56:54.107
ASHLEY: You are! You are!

01:56:54.107 --> 01:56:58.821
LIAM: Look at the guns on that gnome!

01:56:58.821 --> 01:57:06.848
ORION: I can spend the days crafting and then
wouldn't I just need whatever gold that would be?

01:57:06.848 --> 01:57:10.736
MATT: You mean just crafting the jewelry element
of it?

01:57:10.736 --> 01:57:15.236
ORION: Yeah, because the enchantment's-- that's
over there. I'm just not doing anything else.

01:57:15.236 --> 01:57:19.150
MATT: You didn't bring any crafting tools with you
for that. Crafting jewelry requires a specific

01:57:19.206 --> 01:57:24.778
set of tools. Yeah, unfortunately. When you touch
down, you can try to find somebody in the

01:57:24.778 --> 01:57:27.366
vicinity. The journey, here, y'know.

01:57:27.366 --> 01:57:28.727
ORION: Yeah, airship.

01:57:28.727 --> 01:57:30.033
LIAM: Hey DM.

01:57:30.033 --> 01:57:30.934
MATT: Yes?

01:57:30.934 --> 01:57:36.952
LIAM: Since Vax has nothing really to prepare ever
and he's in obviously peak physical condition, I'm

01:57:36.952 --> 01:57:43.885
going to spend the trip helping Keyleth and if she
needs any ingredients for whatever she's doing,

01:57:43.885 --> 01:57:49.615
I'll go get them, I'll hold things up for her, I'm
just going to hang out and try to help her get

01:57:49.615 --> 01:57:50.620
things done.

01:57:50.620 --> 01:57:51.946
LAURA: You're so helpful, brother.

01:57:51.946 --> 01:57:54.644
MARISHA: It's like I have a little familiar. A
scroll-making familiar!

01:57:54.644 --> 01:57:57.167
MATT: All right, not bad, not bad.

01:57:57.167 --> 01:58:02.425
LAURA: I thought you were into Gilmore, darling.
(laughs)

01:58:02.425 --> 01:58:05.502
LIAM: I'm hard to pin down.

01:58:05.502 --> 01:58:11.066
MATT: For the time being, because I don't want to
spend too much time with the internet watching me

01:58:11.241 --> 01:58:13.818
scan through the books to find the rules for
scroll crafting.

01:58:13.818 --> 01:58:15.520
LIAM: That's the best part.

01:58:15.520 --> 01:58:21.565
MATT: Well, yeah. I'll say for the time being,
it'll take you about half a day to make the

01:58:21.565 --> 01:58:27.618
Polymorph scroll and the material components that
are required for the spell putting into the actual

01:58:27.618 --> 01:58:34.394
scroll would run you about 300 gold, I'll say. Oh,
400 gold because it's a 4th-level spell isn't it?

01:58:34.394 --> 01:58:36.079
What level spell is Polymorph?

01:58:36.259 --> 01:58:37.272
MARISHA: Four.

01:58:37.272 --> 01:58:38.595
MATT: Okay, 400 gold.

01:58:38.595 --> 01:58:40.228
MARISHA: Okay, how much gold do we have left
anyway?

01:58:40.228 --> 01:58:43.169
LAURA: Well, I mean, I can use my personal but we
have very little party funds.

01:58:43.169 --> 01:58:45.126
MARISHA: Okay, so I still have a little personal
money left too.

01:58:45.126 --> 01:58:47.429
MATT: I'm sure it'll be different later but
whatever. They're on a ship so it's hard to get

01:58:47.429 --> 01:58:48.542
the materials.

01:58:48.542 --> 01:58:52.405
SAM: It's fine, we'll be fine. Don't waste your
money.

01:58:52.405 --> 01:58:56.407
MARISHA: No, it's okay. No, I'm going to do it.
That's what money's for. I'm going to do two

01:58:56.407 --> 01:58:57.383
Polymorph spells.

01:58:57.383 --> 01:58:58.593
MATT: All right.

01:58:58.593 --> 01:59:03.050
MARISHA: And give one to Vex and one to Tiberius.

01:59:03.050 --> 01:59:04.145
MATT: All right.

01:59:04.145 --> 01:59:06.694
LAURA: All right, I'm taking 400 gold out of my
personal.

01:59:06.749 --> 01:59:08.525
MARISHA: And I'll take 400 out of mine.

01:59:08.525 --> 01:59:14.330
ORION: Oh, I still have mine. I can give you 400.

01:59:14.330 --> 01:59:15.691
MARISHA: You'll give me 400? All right.

01:59:15.691 --> 01:59:16.737
MATT: All right.

01:59:16.737 --> 01:59:22.133
LAURA: I'm spending most of the time up near
Captain Damon, watching him work.

01:59:22.133 --> 01:59:29.863
MATT: He seems very focused on keeping the ship
going. He does steer you around one thunderstorm

01:59:29.863 --> 01:59:37.267
that's rolling by and takes you on the wide angle
around. It's very relaxing up here, a little cold.

01:59:37.267 --> 01:59:53.735
But it's relaxing. Let's say, the beginning of day
three, as you all are resting underneath the hold,

01:59:53.735 --> 02:00:03.977
you're all shaken awake by a sudden lurching of
the ship. It just shifts in such a heavy way that

02:00:04.030 --> 02:00:09.512
you aren't expecting it. All of you are pulled out
of your stupor for a second and begin coming out

02:00:09.518 --> 02:00:12.901
of your individual rooms to check on each other
and see what happened, but apparently the ship is

02:00:12.901 --> 02:00:17.215
or was-- some sort of a shuddering physicality to
it.

02:00:17.215 --> 02:00:20.794
TRAVIS: I rush to the box.

02:00:20.794 --> 02:00:25.528
SAM: I rush to Captain Damon. What the hell just
happened? Also, are you married?

02:00:25.528 --> 02:00:33.911
MATT: All right, so you rush straight to the box and as
you go to open the door that leads to the boxes,

02:00:33.964 --> 02:00:44.679
you can see, in the room, is Kima and both of the
Scalebearers are there, reaching for weapons as

02:00:44.679 --> 02:00:49.638
the door opens. They see you and relax for a
second and Kima goes like, "What was that? What

02:00:49.638 --> 02:00:50.671
"was that?"

02:00:50.671 --> 02:00:51.945
TRAVIS: I was going to ask you the same thing.

02:00:51.945 --> 02:00:52.721
MARISHA: Shit.

02:00:52.721 --> 02:00:53.667
MATT: "I have no idea."

02:00:53.667 --> 02:00:55.442
ORION: I rush up to the bow.

02:00:55.442 --> 02:00:56.788
MARISHA: I also rush to the deck.

02:00:56.788 --> 02:00:59.661
MATT: Okay, as you guys are rushing up along with
Scanlan-- everyone else rushes up-- you come to

02:00:59.661 --> 02:01:05.281
the surface and you're just cresting into sunrise,
like the sky itself is mostly dark on one side

02:01:05.281 --> 02:01:11.812
with the blue slowly leading into a bright
orange-ish yellow to the other side as the morning

02:01:12.001 --> 02:01:17.677
light is starting to slowly crest over the
horizon. As you get to the surface you immediately

02:01:17.677 --> 02:01:24.460
notice there are a handful of large, winged
creatures that are currently harrying the side of

02:01:24.460 --> 02:01:30.124
the boat. As you step to the surface you see
(shhw) one just dives past you real fast. You

02:01:30.124 --> 02:01:34.482
notice as one of them takes off in the
distance-- it was just a blur of quick-moving

02:01:34.501 --> 02:01:42.988
wings-- it looks dragon-like in its physicality but
it's smaller than any dragon you've encountered.

02:01:43.053 --> 02:01:47.286
It's flapping giant wings and lets out a 
screech as it takes off, but it looks like there's

02:01:47.286 --> 02:01:48.748
something on its back.

02:01:48.748 --> 02:01:49.787
TRAVIS: What?

02:01:49.787 --> 02:01:53.080
MATT: You see two to three more of these now
starting to divebomb.

02:01:53.080 --> 02:01:54.336
SAM: It's Daenerys!

02:01:54.336 --> 02:01:59.234
MATT: You can see the rest of the deckhands are up
there now, with weapons ready, and are starting to

02:01:59.234 --> 02:02:00.561
fight some of these off.

02:02:00.561 --> 02:02:05.290
LAURA: Can we use any kind of perception to see if
the things on them are controlling them?

02:02:05.359 --> 02:02:06.559
MATT: Go ahead and make a perception check.

02:02:06.559 --> 02:02:08.272
LAURA: I get plus two for any dragon-y things.

02:02:08.272 --> 02:02:09.541
MATT: Good to know!

02:02:09.541 --> 02:02:15.646
SAM: Tiberius, your brothers are here!

02:02:15.646 --> 02:02:19.129
ORION: I don't think I'm associated with these.

02:02:19.129 --> 02:02:21.104
LAURA: 19.

02:02:21.104 --> 02:02:23.770
MATT: 19. Glancing at the backs of these--

02:02:23.770 --> 02:02:24.980
LIAM: (garbled) 26!

02:02:24.980 --> 02:02:25.990
MATT: What did you say?

02:02:25.990 --> 02:02:27.005
TRAVIS: What?

02:02:27.005 --> 02:02:27.955
LIAM: 26.

02:02:27.955 --> 02:02:34.576
MATT: 26. All right, between the two of you, you notice
that even in this low-light circumstance, there

02:02:34.633 --> 02:02:40.802
appear to be on three of these winged, dragon-like
creatures smallish, humanoid entities that are on

02:02:40.802 --> 02:02:46.705
small, almost leather strapped saddles that are
put on the sides of this creature. They're

02:02:46.705 --> 02:02:52.227
clutching onto it and each one is carrying some
sort of large, spear-like weapon. There is a

02:02:52.227 --> 02:02:56.731
fourth one in the distance that does not appear to
be dragonoid. This one appears to be

02:02:56.731 --> 02:02:59.398
feather-covered in its physical form.

02:02:59.398 --> 02:03:01.817
MARISHA: Feather-covered?

02:03:01.817 --> 02:03:04.229
ORION: There's a big large one, right though?

02:03:04.229 --> 02:03:07.741
MATT: Yes. Which, at this moment, we are going to
roll initiative.

02:03:07.913 --> 02:03:09.853
MARISHA: Can I do a nature check?

02:03:09.853 --> 02:03:11.199
MATT: You can.

02:03:11.199 --> 02:03:12.924
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay, okay.

02:03:12.924 --> 02:03:17.152
ORION: I cast Blur before any of that shit. I
didn't get to say what I wanted to do.

02:03:17.205 --> 02:03:22.831
TALIESIN: Ugh. That's the worst initiative I am
capable of having.

02:03:22.831 --> 02:03:25.015
SAM: I'm just going to keep rolling until I get a
better number.

02:03:25.015 --> 02:03:27.288
MARISHA: Do I do a nature roll first or should I
do an initiative roll first?

02:03:27.288 --> 02:03:28.462
SAM: Wow.

02:03:28.462 --> 02:03:29.627
TRAVIS: Sweet.

02:03:29.627 --> 02:03:31.357
MARISHA: Can I do a nature check first?

02:03:31.357 --> 02:03:35.113
MATT: First, I want to place you guys. So you guys
are coming up from below, so I would

02:03:35.113 --> 02:03:35.979
probably put you--

02:03:35.979 --> 02:03:37.290
LAURA: Oh my God look at the ship!

02:03:37.290 --> 02:03:38.136
ASHLEY: Whoa!

02:03:38.136 --> 02:03:39.503
MARISHA: Cool, look at that!

02:03:39.503 --> 02:03:41.346
SAM: Oh, I like that.

02:03:41.346 --> 02:03:42.667
TRAVIS: Dude, that's pretty.

02:03:42.667 --> 02:03:44.225
LAURA: Look at the crystals!

02:03:44.225 --> 02:03:51.038
SAM: Oh, wow. I like how all of our viewers are
just looking at our midsections.

02:03:51.038 --> 02:03:53.214
LIAM: Aw, I've got to turn on Twitch so I can see
it.

02:03:53.214 --> 02:03:55.580
MARISHA: Turn on Twitch, turn on Twitch!

02:03:55.580 --> 02:03:56.838
MATT: Oh, Liam.

02:03:56.838 --> 02:04:01.537
TRAVIS: Here, I'll pick you up. Don't do it.
Ready?

02:04:01.537 --> 02:04:04.471
LAURA: It looks like the crystals are really 3D in
the picture.

02:04:04.645 --> 02:04:06.169
ASHLEY: (gasps) Matt!

02:04:06.169 --> 02:04:07.585
LIAM: Well, the Twitch, the Twitch is up.

02:04:07.585 --> 02:04:09.283
LAURA: That's amazing!

02:04:09.283 --> 02:04:16.558
LIAM: (gasps) This is like that Jabba's Cruiser
game that came out.

02:04:16.558 --> 02:04:17.959
TRAVIS: Totally.

02:04:17.959 --> 02:04:19.001
LIAM: Anybody, anybody?

02:04:19.001 --> 02:04:19.801
LAURA: No.

02:04:19.801 --> 02:04:20.578
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:04:20.578 --> 02:04:21.986
SAM: Yes. Yeah sure, that.

02:04:21.986 --> 02:04:23.291
TRAVIS: (whisper) Return of the Jedi.

02:04:23.291 --> 02:04:24.453
MATT: All righty, so.

02:04:24.453 --> 02:04:29.193
LAURA: Oh my gosh. Whoa.

02:04:29.193 --> 02:04:33.707
MATT: As you guys come up to the surface, you can
see these three entities swooping around and

02:04:33.707 --> 02:04:40.011
dive-bombing the remainder of the guard and
deckhands that are now, currently, have haphazard

02:04:40.011 --> 02:04:43.982
armor on and they're trying to strike at these
things as they swing by. Let's go ahead and roll

02:04:43.982 --> 02:04:45.584
initiative, folks.

02:04:45.584 --> 02:04:47.060
TRAVIS: Did it.

02:04:47.060 --> 02:04:55.363
MARISHA: Oh, that's not bad, that's all right.
I'll take that.

02:04:55.363 --> 02:04:57.694
MATT: So, we have 25 to 20?

02:04:57.694 --> 02:04:58.886
LAURA: 22.

02:04:58.886 --> 02:05:00.433
MATT: 22.

02:05:00.433 --> 02:05:01.713
LIAM: 20.

02:05:01.713 --> 02:05:03.851
MATT: Who else had their hand up?

02:05:03.851 --> 02:05:04.961
LAURA: 20.

02:05:04.961 --> 02:05:12.516
MATT: Okay, so 20. All right. 20 to 15?

02:05:12.516 --> 02:05:13.677
ORION: 19.

02:05:13.677 --> 02:05:14.674
TRAVIS: 19.

02:05:14.674 --> 02:05:16.104
LIAM: 20.

02:05:16.104 --> 02:05:17.334
LAURA: (laughs) He heard you.

02:05:17.334 --> 02:05:18.197
TRAVIS: We already got your 20.

02:05:18.197 --> 02:05:19.141
SAM: We got your damn 20.

02:05:19.141 --> 02:05:20.078
MARISHA: 17.

02:05:20.078 --> 02:05:21.046
MATT: Hold on.

02:05:21.046 --> 02:05:22.303
TRAVIS: 19, 19.

02:05:22.303 --> 02:05:25.749
MATT: 17, you said, Keyleth?

02:05:25.749 --> 02:05:26.707
MARISHA: Yep.

02:05:26.707 --> 02:05:34.333
MATT: All right. 15 to ten?

02:05:34.333 --> 02:05:37.765
TRAVIS: 15 to ten?

02:05:37.765 --> 02:05:39.268
MATT: Ten to five?

02:05:39.268 --> 02:05:40.186
TALIESIN: Nine.

02:05:40.186 --> 02:05:41.028
SAM: Eight.

02:05:41.028 --> 02:05:43.207
TRAVIS: Look at Percy.

02:05:43.207 --> 02:05:44.648
LAURA: What did you get?

02:05:44.648 --> 02:05:45.605
SAM: We always get the lowest.

02:05:45.605 --> 02:05:46.652
ASHLEY: What up, four?

02:05:46.652 --> 02:05:48.091
MATT: Yeah. (laughs)

02:05:48.091 --> 02:05:49.648
ASHLEY: Hey, it's not bad for the cleric to go
last.

02:05:49.648 --> 02:05:51.136
LAURA: That's true!

02:05:51.136 --> 02:05:56.642
MATT: All right. So, top of the round. Vex, you've
got this.

02:05:56.642 --> 02:06:03.570
LAURA: Okay! I'm going to do-- they're all far
away from each other, aren't they?

02:06:03.570 --> 02:06:07.893
MATT: They're all pretty spread out now, yeah.
They're all recouping from what looked like a

02:06:07.893 --> 02:06:12.701
coordinated attack, and you can see, there appears
to be-- what you normally see are about four to

02:06:12.701 --> 02:06:17.547
five deckhands. There's only three up there right
now with Captain Damon.

02:06:17.547 --> 02:06:18.941
LAURA: Jeez Louise.

02:06:18.941 --> 02:06:21.416
MATT: They're either sleeping or not currently in
the battle.

02:06:21.416 --> 02:06:23.511
ORION: What color are the dragons?

02:06:23.511 --> 02:06:27.238
MATT: From what you can tell, the dragon-like
creatures-- which, as you get a better look at

02:06:27.238 --> 02:06:33.584
these moment, you know these. A large number of
the Draconian army utilizes these as mounts. These

02:06:33.584 --> 02:06:46.704
are wyverns, and they are all in a ruddy, brown,
brass-like coloration to their form. Best you can

02:06:46.704 --> 02:06:49.578
tell in this light. All right. Vex, what are you
doing?

02:06:49.578 --> 02:06:57.096
LAURA: I am going to Hunter's Mark one of the ones
with the rider on them.

02:06:57.096 --> 02:06:59.549
MATT: Okay. All of them have a rider, it seems.

02:06:59.549 --> 02:07:00.689
LAURA: Oh, all of them?

02:07:00.689 --> 02:07:01.514
ORION: Yes.

02:07:01.514 --> 02:07:02.634
LAURA: Even the one with feathers?

02:07:02.634 --> 02:07:03.663
MATT: Even the one with feathers.

02:07:03.663 --> 02:07:04.844
LAURA: I'll go for the feathered one, then.

02:07:04.844 --> 02:07:07.049
MATT: All right. Hunter's Mark.

02:07:07.049 --> 02:07:10.849
LAURA: Hunter's Mark! Hunter's ring.

02:07:10.849 --> 02:07:12.801
MATT: Hunter's ring. All right.

02:07:12.801 --> 02:07:20.559
LAURA: And I'm going to Hail of Thorns him at a
level three.

02:07:20.629 --> 02:07:22.696
MATT: Okay.

02:07:22.696 --> 02:07:24.001
LAURA: Yeah?

02:07:24.001 --> 02:07:27.774
MATT: What's the range of that?

02:07:27.774 --> 02:07:32.107
LAURA: It just says a ranged weapon.

02:07:32.107 --> 02:07:35.136
MATT: So whatever your weapon's range is. What's
your weapon's range for your longbow?

02:07:35.136 --> 02:07:39.921
LAURA: That is a really good question. I'm going
to run forward.

02:07:39.921 --> 02:07:42.107
MATT: All right. How far are you going to run?

02:07:42.107 --> 02:07:44.161
LAURA: That looks about right.

02:07:44.161 --> 02:07:45.633
MATT: That's as far as you can go with your
movement.

02:07:45.633 --> 02:07:51.726
LAURA: Yeah. That means I can duck against one of
those walls where the stairs is, right?

02:07:51.726 --> 02:07:52.582
MATT: Yeah.

02:07:52.582 --> 02:07:53.418
LAURA: Okay, cool.

02:07:53.418 --> 02:07:59.154
MATT: It will help you out with that. All right,
so the range of the longbow comes to 150-- yeah,

02:07:59.154 --> 02:08:00.259
you're fine.

02:08:00.259 --> 02:08:05.090
LAURA: So a regular attack.

02:08:05.140 --> 02:08:08.628
MATT: Yep, so roll for attack on him.

02:08:08.705 --> 02:08:11.848
LAURA: 17.

02:08:11.848 --> 02:08:14.497
MATT: 17 does hit.

02:08:14.497 --> 02:08:20.321
LAURA: Yes! Okay, so regular attack and then also
thorn attack, right?

02:08:20.501 --> 02:08:24.458
MATT: Yep. So you go ahead and roll damage for the
spell at level three.

02:08:24.458 --> 02:08:45.947
LAURA: And three. 23 plus my regular 14.

02:08:45.947 --> 02:08:51.986
MATT: Nice, so a total of 37? Nice! Is that a
radial explosion?

02:08:51.986 --> 02:08:55.520
LAURA: Yeah, so that should get him and the rider
on the Hail of Thorns part.

02:08:55.520 --> 02:09:02.122
MATT: Good, so the rider itself also takes the
damage. All right, so as you release the arrow,

02:09:02.122 --> 02:09:05.860
(ssch) it arcs through the air, and you see the
wind itself is very strong at this point in the

02:09:05.860 --> 02:09:10.803
morning, but you still manage, thanks to your
training and the magical nature of the arrow that

02:09:10.803 --> 02:09:14.879
you fire, strikes true, slamming into the side of
this giant-- and you can see it now, flying, with

02:09:14.879 --> 02:09:21.644
this beaked eagle-like head. This is a griffon.
You've seen them occasionally, usually wild, and

02:09:21.644 --> 02:09:25.384
you stay away from them. This one appears to be
used and harnessed as a mount. However, the arrow

02:09:25.384 --> 02:09:30.573
slams into it and detonates with a spray of
magical thorns. You can see it recoils back, giving

02:09:30.573 --> 02:09:32.265
this (screech) sound.

02:09:32.327 --> 02:09:37.435
LAURA: Oh! Hunter's Mark! I said it. Three
additional damage for Hunter's Mark on that.

02:09:37.435 --> 02:09:45.139
MATT: All right. Great. (laughs) So that's your
bonus action and your first attack. You get a

02:09:45.139 --> 02:09:46.414
second normal attack, too.

02:09:46.414 --> 02:09:48.217
LAURA: Oh, shit! Awesome. Let's do it.

02:09:48.217 --> 02:09:50.014
TRAVIS: It just explodes in thorns. It's not a
fire arrow?

02:09:50.014 --> 02:09:51.118
MATT: No.

02:09:51.118 --> 02:09:53.166
LAURA: That is a 24.

02:09:53.166 --> 02:09:54.592
MATT: 24 definitively hits.

02:09:54.592 --> 02:09:55.475
LAURA: Okay.

02:09:55.475 --> 02:09:56.685
MATT: Against the griffon, as well?

02:09:56.685 --> 02:09:57.545
LAURA: Yes.

02:09:57.545 --> 02:09:58.960
MATT: All right.

02:09:58.960 --> 02:10:00.042
LAURA: Ten.

02:10:00.042 --> 02:10:06.188
MATT: Ten damage, all right. Got it. So as the
griffon's reeling back and trying to flap away, a

02:10:06.309 --> 02:10:10.712
second arrow strikes it in its side. It
screeches again in pain and begins to rise

02:10:10.712 --> 02:10:15.248
up over the actual area. Ooh, I get to use these
again.

02:10:15.248 --> 02:10:17.133
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:10:17.133 --> 02:10:18.488
MATT: I love it.

02:10:18.488 --> 02:10:19.748
LAURA: I love it!

02:10:19.748 --> 02:10:24.370
MATT: All right. So that ends your turn. I believe
you've moved and done everything else.

02:10:24.370 --> 02:10:27.814
All righty.

02:10:27.814 --> 02:10:30.034
LAURA: Oh, I didn't move Trinket at all.

02:10:30.034 --> 02:10:31.315
MATT: You can move Trinket if you want, still.

02:10:31.315 --> 02:10:32.532
LAURA: I want him to be near me.

02:10:32.532 --> 02:10:35.064
MATT: Okay, Trinket moves up to you, ready to
guard angrily.

02:10:35.064 --> 02:10:36.896
LAURA: Yeah, but blocking on the wall.

02:10:36.896 --> 02:10:37.905
MATT: Up in here?

02:10:37.905 --> 02:10:38.889
LAURA: Yeah.

02:10:38.889 --> 02:10:46.428
MATT: All right. That ends your turn. Next up,
these guards all shift over to these three

02:10:46.428 --> 02:10:51.452
emplacements over here. You have large, defensive
bolts that are locked into the sides of the ship

02:10:51.452 --> 02:10:56.275
and they go ahead and they reach over in the
barrel and you can see they take one out, and each

02:10:56.275 --> 02:11:00.037
one of these giant bolts has a rope attached to
the end of it, and they start loading it into it,

02:11:00.037 --> 02:11:04.631
pulling back to prepare it for an attack.
It takes their entire turn to do that, but now

02:11:04.690 --> 02:11:08.802
they're at the ready to strike out against
whatever they can manage to aim on.

02:11:08.802 --> 02:11:10.970
TRAVIS: Is that also at the front of the ship, is
that what that is?

02:11:10.970 --> 02:11:15.973
MATT: One on the front ship there, and one on each
side there. That ends their turn. Vax, you're up.

02:11:15.973 --> 02:11:21.876
LIAM: All right, I'm running up right behind my
sister's shoulder and because of my Assassinate

02:11:22.050 --> 02:11:24.621
perk I have advantage on this because they haven't
gone, yeah?

02:11:24.621 --> 02:11:25.889
MATT: Correct.

02:11:25.889 --> 02:11:32.479
LIAM: So I'm going to click my boots of haste as I
come up behind her and dagger-dagger-dagger over

02:11:32.479 --> 02:11:41.284
her shoulder. I'll use my brand-new Dagger of
Life-Stealing for the first time. That was a 19,

02:11:41.284 --> 02:11:42.975
which is a critical hit for me.

02:11:42.975 --> 02:11:47.096
MATT: You are at disadvantage on these attacks
because they are beyond your 20 foot

02:11:47.096 --> 02:11:48.601
dagger-throwing range.

02:11:48.601 --> 02:11:55.194
LIAM: Okay, well, I had advantage for Assassinate,
and disadvantage for the distance, so that brings

02:11:55.256 --> 02:12:00.274
me down to even. My first roll was a 19, which is
still a critical hit for me.

02:12:00.274 --> 02:12:02.793
MATT: Is that how it works?

02:12:02.793 --> 02:12:05.176
(laughter)

02:12:05.176 --> 02:12:08.682
MATT: Let me double-check here. You have
advantage-- it's true, you do.

02:12:08.754 --> 02:12:10.392
LIAM: They haven't gone yet.

02:12:10.392 --> 02:12:13.527
MATT: No, it hasn't, you have advantage, it
cancels it out, so yes. That first strike is a

02:12:13.527 --> 02:12:15.429
critical hit on this wyvern right here.

02:12:15.429 --> 02:12:19.819
LIAM: Throwing over my sister's shoulder, so--

02:12:19.819 --> 02:12:21.838
LAURA: Warn me first!

02:12:21.838 --> 02:12:27.598
LIAM: So here we go. Rolling dice in Jersey, it's
wonderful.

02:12:27.598 --> 02:12:29.526
MARISHA: (laughs) Rolling dice in New Jersey.

02:12:29.526 --> 02:12:34.694
LIAM: That makes ten. So that's a 20 for that.

02:12:34.694 --> 02:12:35.720
MATT: All right.

02:12:35.720 --> 02:12:37.487
LIAM: And I'm going to start slinging the other
two daggers.

02:12:37.487 --> 02:12:38.448
MATT: All right.

02:12:38.448 --> 02:12:42.771
LIAM: First one probably misses, it's a 14.

02:12:42.771 --> 02:12:44.667
MATT: A 14 against the wyvern?

02:12:44.667 --> 02:12:47.837
LIAM: Well, I don't know, do these all get
advantage?

02:12:47.837 --> 02:12:54.254
MATT: Technically, that's another good question.
Huh. Look at this.

02:12:54.254 --> 02:12:56.718
LIAM: All three are before they go.

02:12:56.718 --> 02:13:01.408
MATT: It's true, that's why I'm thinking probably,
I'm pretty sure you can get advantage on... yeah,

02:13:01.408 --> 02:13:04.267
on attack rolls against any creatures not in
combat yet, so yeah.

02:13:04.267 --> 02:13:06.935
LIAM: All right, so then actually that was a 20.

02:13:06.935 --> 02:13:08.852
MATT: All right, that definitely hits.

02:13:08.852 --> 02:13:16.077
LIAM: Okay. That is an eight and the third dagger
goes (wa-shing) right over Vex's

02:13:16.146 --> 02:13:20.240
shoulder for a 27.

02:13:20.240 --> 02:13:22.749
MATT: All right.

02:13:22.749 --> 02:13:29.591
LIAM: This one is the poison dagger of course, so
that is ten of damage and then

02:13:29.591 --> 02:13:32.354
it's a DC of 15 for poison.

02:13:32.354 --> 02:13:40.779
MATT: All right. The dagger strikes true, you are
uncertain if it's had an effect unfortunately. At

02:13:40.779 --> 02:13:47.818
this distance, it's hard to tell its physical
reaction to the impact. However, the dagger seems

02:13:47.818 --> 02:13:54.532
to be making definite damaged appearances to its
physical exterior and you see it recoiling from

02:13:54.532 --> 02:13:57.781
the attacks and begins to once again fly up as
well to try and get out of range.

02:13:57.781 --> 02:13:59.059
LIAM: I'm happy.

02:13:59.059 --> 02:14:05.309
MATT: All right. That ends your turn. It's now the
griffon's turn, griffon and the griffon rider.

02:14:05.309 --> 02:14:06.865
LAURA: Oh no.

02:14:06.865 --> 02:14:13.772
MATT: The griffon rider and the griffon are going
to swoop down, half its movement, it's going to

02:14:13.959 --> 02:14:16.925
attempt to grapple against that guard.

02:14:16.925 --> 02:14:17.948
MARISHA: Grappling?

02:14:17.948 --> 02:14:18.991
TALIESIN: Grapple-grapple.

02:14:18.991 --> 02:14:20.666
LAURA AND MARISHA: Oh no.

02:14:20.666 --> 02:14:21.727
TRAVIS: That the captain?

02:14:21.727 --> 02:14:22.755
MATT: Who fails his check. Grabs--

02:14:22.755 --> 02:14:24.135
MARISHA: Oh no, he's going to throw him over the
edge.

02:14:24.135 --> 02:14:25.695
MATT: Grabs this guard into its claws--

02:14:25.695 --> 02:14:27.299
LIAM: Not Simon.

02:14:27.299 --> 02:14:29.183
MATT: And then flies up and over this side--

02:14:29.183 --> 02:14:30.710
MARISHA: He's going to toss his ass over the
edge!

02:14:30.710 --> 02:14:31.928
MATT: And he's going to release it.

02:14:31.928 --> 02:14:33.865
TRAVIS: Oh, you are shitting me!

02:14:33.865 --> 02:14:35.488
MARISHA: Does someone have a reaction?

02:14:35.488 --> 02:14:37.847
MATT: He's going to attempt-- if you have
something crazy.

02:14:37.847 --> 02:14:40.507
MARISHA: Can someone do anything? Reaction?

02:14:40.507 --> 02:14:47.394
MATT: The guard misses-- or fails to hold on tight
with his last reaction to try and grapple back.

02:14:47.394 --> 02:14:48.863
TALIESIN: That's such dick.

02:14:48.863 --> 02:14:53.653
MATT: The guard, you watch as the griffon swoops
down, grabs him, both of its claws and talons

02:14:53.653 --> 02:14:57.950
wrapping around his shoulders, lifting him up, and
chucking him over the side, you hear him scream

02:14:57.950 --> 02:15:00.462
(ahhh) as he vanishes.

02:15:00.527 --> 02:15:03.489
LAURA: As a reaction, can we fricking tie
ourselves down to the boat?

02:15:03.489 --> 02:15:07.047
MATT: You have no ropes immediately around you,
you have to go to the side.

02:15:07.127 --> 02:15:08.614
LAURA: I do, I have the rope of--

02:15:08.614 --> 02:15:10.009
MATT: You have nothing to tie it to at the
moment.

02:15:10.009 --> 02:15:11.090
LAURA: Shit. Trinket.

02:15:11.090 --> 02:15:14.217
MATT: You have the pegs all on the side here where
the ropes attach to, so you guys could do that.

02:15:14.290 --> 02:15:15.629
MARISHA: I have some Grasping Vines?

02:15:15.629 --> 02:15:18.709
ASHLEY: We could just attach it to all of
ourselves, and where we go one, we go all. If they

02:15:18.709 --> 02:15:20.094
take one, they take all of us.

02:15:20.094 --> 02:15:23.472
MATT: And with the last bit of the griffon's
flight movement, that was then there.

02:15:23.472 --> 02:15:24.928
MARISHA: It would make it--

02:15:24.928 --> 02:15:26.485
ASHLEY: It wouldn't be able to lift all of us.

02:15:26.485 --> 02:15:29.719
MARISHA: Well, it would make it difficult, he
would have to break against strength checks

02:15:29.719 --> 02:15:31.103
against Grog and stuff, yeah.

02:15:31.103 --> 02:15:40.476
MATT: So there is the griffon's current position
on its turn. That ends there. Tiberius and Grog

02:15:40.476 --> 02:15:41.781
both go.

02:15:41.781 --> 02:15:46.404
ORION: Okay, I'm going to move over here.

02:15:46.404 --> 02:15:51.451
MATT: Okay, so one, two, three, four, five, six.
That's as far as you can get there.

02:15:51.451 --> 02:15:54.952
ORION: I'm still in range of that guy, right?

02:15:54.952 --> 02:15:55.977
MATT: Yeah.

02:15:55.977 --> 02:16:03.796
ORION: Good. I'm going to use Telekinesis to lift
the rider off and chuck him off.

02:16:03.796 --> 02:16:07.497
MATT: Go ahead and make your check plus five with
your modifier.

02:16:07.678 --> 02:16:17.414
ORION: So that's-- no, but it's still okay. That's
16 plus my this thing, that's 19?

02:16:17.414 --> 02:16:19.022
LIAM: Come on, Tiberius.

02:16:19.022 --> 02:16:26.511
MATT: So the rider, which as you look over you can
see appears to be small and halfling-like in

02:16:26.511 --> 02:16:31.496
physical form-- you reach over with your
Telekinesis spell and concentrate. The entity

02:16:31.496 --> 02:16:36.569
that's gripping onto it and holding the spear
all of a sudden gets lifted up and

02:16:36.569 --> 02:16:38.382
then flung off the side.

02:16:38.382 --> 02:16:48.977
ORION: And I turn to the wyvern and I go,
(speaking Draconic) and I, in dragon-speak or

02:16:48.977 --> 02:16:51.052
Draconic, whatever, I say--

02:16:51.052 --> 02:16:52.384
MARISHA: You say, "Bad dragon!"

02:16:52.384 --> 02:16:54.567
ORION: Fight with me or be free.

02:16:54.567 --> 02:16:56.747
LAURA: Or be free? And be free.

02:16:56.747 --> 02:16:59.071
ORION: Or. He can, meaning--

02:16:59.071 --> 02:17:00.224
LAURA: Oh, I get it.

02:17:00.224 --> 02:17:02.122
MARISHA: Or go peace out.

02:17:02.122 --> 02:17:03.113
LAURA: Okay.

02:17:03.113 --> 02:17:04.127
ORION: Right.

02:17:04.127 --> 02:17:05.958
LIAM: It all sounded like Enya to me.

02:17:05.958 --> 02:17:11.655
MATT: Make-- I'll say for this one, make an animal
handling roll.

02:17:11.655 --> 02:17:13.098
ASHLEY: Come on.

02:17:13.098 --> 02:17:15.149
LAURA: Natural 20.

02:17:15.149 --> 02:17:19.534
ASHLEY: Advantage because you're a dragonborn.

02:17:19.534 --> 02:17:20.675
ORION: Nope.

02:17:20.675 --> 02:17:22.337
LIAM: Come on, Tibber-hoods.

02:17:22.337 --> 02:17:23.590
ORION: Like eight, yeah.

02:17:23.590 --> 02:17:24.703
MATT: Okay. Good to know.

02:17:24.703 --> 02:17:25.989
MARISHA: Did you have disadvantage?

02:17:25.989 --> 02:17:28.589
ORION: No, I had advantage.

02:17:28.589 --> 02:17:29.649
MARISHA: Oh.

02:17:29.649 --> 02:17:38.161
MATT: Yeah. So this halfling or gnomish entity is
now falling out of the air. That ends Tiberius's

02:17:38.161 --> 02:17:39.844
turn. Grog, what's up?

02:17:39.844 --> 02:17:47.313
TRAVIS: I turn to the group and say, Make sure
someone guards the box in case it's a distraction.

02:17:47.313 --> 02:17:54.293
And then I rage. And I would like to run to the
front of the ship where the captain was, as far as

02:17:54.293 --> 02:17:55.310
I can--

02:17:55.310 --> 02:17:56.532
MATT: The captain's right here.

02:17:56.532 --> 02:17:57.328
TRAVIS: Oh, the captain's there?

02:17:57.328 --> 02:17:58.374
MATT: Yes, the back of the ship--

02:17:58.374 --> 02:17:59.478
LAURA: That was the guard.

02:17:59.478 --> 02:18:01.600
MATT: The guard got flung off the side, the
captain's still out there holding on to the--

02:18:01.600 --> 02:18:03.004
TRAVIS: I will run to the front crystal.

02:18:03.004 --> 02:18:04.241
MATT: Okay.

02:18:04.241 --> 02:18:07.901
TRAVIS: If I can get there. It's 40 feet is how
far I can go.

02:18:07.901 --> 02:18:10.527
MATT: 40 feet is right there.

02:18:10.527 --> 02:18:12.377
TRAVIS: Son of a bitch. Okay.

02:18:12.377 --> 02:18:15.268
MATT: Well, you raged as a bonus action, you could
use your action to dash and go the rest of the

02:18:15.268 --> 02:18:17.210
distance, doubling your movement.

02:18:17.210 --> 02:18:18.893
TRAVIS: I wanted to tie myself to something,
though.

02:18:18.893 --> 02:18:20.164
MATT: Okay.

02:18:20.164 --> 02:18:23.117
LAURA: You could run to the side and tie yourself
to--

02:18:23.117 --> 02:18:25.172
TALIESIN: What is that thing at the very front of
the ship?

02:18:25.172 --> 02:18:29.424
MATT: Right there? It's another one of these
ballistas. They've all been set, this one has been

02:18:29.424 --> 02:18:32.271
set to fire, just the person who was currently
helming it got chucked off the side.

02:18:32.271 --> 02:18:34.528
MARISHA: Ooh, you're the shooty guy.

02:18:34.596 --> 02:18:37.144
TRAVIS: Is there a railing on the side of the ship
at all?

02:18:37.144 --> 02:18:39.313
MATT: There is a railing, it's about waist-high.

02:18:39.313 --> 02:18:42.474
LAURA: And there's pegs to tie yourself to on the
sides.

02:18:42.474 --> 02:18:43.861
MATT: Yeah, each one of these dots.

02:18:43.861 --> 02:18:47.911
TRAVIS: Okay, I have a hundred feet of chain. Can
I take the chain out of the bag of holding, wrap

02:18:47.911 --> 02:18:51.882
it around my wrist, and wrap it around the
railing, and then that'll be all I do.

02:18:51.882 --> 02:18:53.708
Can I do that?

02:18:53.708 --> 02:18:59.096
MATT: Yeah? With your movement, you can get to
there, unless you wanted to instead head

02:18:59.096 --> 02:19:00.184
over here and--

02:19:00.184 --> 02:19:01.224
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'll do that.

02:19:01.224 --> 02:19:04.062
MATT: So instead of going further up that route,
you go ahead and wrap the chain around there,

02:19:04.062 --> 02:19:07.859
sure. Chain around your wrist, you tangle it in
with your Chain of Returning. You go ahead and

02:19:07.859 --> 02:19:13.310
take the chain and wrap it around the side of the
peg and pull it taut. That's your turn. All right.

02:19:13.310 --> 02:19:15.483
That ends Grog's turn. Keyleth, you're up.

02:19:15.483 --> 02:19:24.626
MARISHA: I'm going to move my speed over
here-ish.

02:19:24.626 --> 02:19:25.834
MATT: All right.

02:19:25.834 --> 02:19:31.633
MARISHA: And then would you say I'm 60 feet,
within range of that guy?

02:19:31.633 --> 02:19:34.605
MATT: Oh yeah. You're within 25, 30 feet of him.

02:19:34.605 --> 02:19:39.587
MARISHA: Oh, am I? Well, let me back up a bit,
then. Just right-- Oh, I can walk across that.

02:19:39.587 --> 02:19:40.633
MATT: Yeah.

02:19:40.633 --> 02:19:41.637
MARISHA: Oh, fun.

02:19:41.637 --> 02:19:47.152
MATT: It's a wooden lattice basically, it's mostly
covered. It's what they remove when they're

02:19:47.152 --> 02:19:48.808
putting large cargo in the ship.

02:19:48.808 --> 02:19:51.836
MARISHA: Right. Gotcha. And there's still a rider
on that guy?

02:19:51.836 --> 02:19:53.832
MATT: Yes, there's a rider on all of them.

02:19:53.832 --> 02:20:02.330
MARISHA: Okay. I am going to cast Polymorph on
that wyvern, and I turn him into a bunny rabbit.

02:20:02.330 --> 02:20:06.309
TRAVIS: (laughs) You're going to kill a bunny.

02:20:06.309 --> 02:20:08.853
SAM: No, he won't die, he won't die.

02:20:08.853 --> 02:20:10.363
MARISHA: Oh, I am going to kill a bunny.

02:20:10.363 --> 02:20:11.464
LAURA: Six hit points?

02:20:11.464 --> 02:20:12.584
ASHLEY: The guy riding him's going to be like
ahhh!

02:20:12.647 --> 02:20:14.700
TALIESIN: That is the least innocent thing she's
killed in this game so far.

02:20:14.700 --> 02:20:16.523
TRAVIS: That is an Acme cartoon waiting to
happen.

02:20:16.523 --> 02:20:18.985
MARISHA: That is true. I just think it's going to
be funny. That's pretty much what I thought.

02:20:18.985 --> 02:20:21.245
LIAM: Buck, buck. Thanks, Easter Bunny!

02:20:21.245 --> 02:20:23.045
MATT: All right, so what's the DC on that?

02:20:23.045 --> 02:20:26.650
MARISHA: I guess make a wisdom saving throw-- the
wyvern has to make a wisdom saving throw.

02:20:26.650 --> 02:20:31.498
MATT: What's your DC on that? Your spell DC.

02:20:31.498 --> 02:20:32.786
MARISHA: 18.

02:20:32.786 --> 02:20:38.637
MATT: Into what creature?

02:20:38.691 --> 02:20:40.056
MARISHA: A wyvern.

02:20:40.056 --> 02:20:41.719
A bunny.

02:20:41.719 --> 02:20:43.457
MATT: Okay, so. So. (laughs)

02:20:43.457 --> 02:20:45.410
MARISHA: Or you know what, you know what would be
funnier?

02:20:45.410 --> 02:20:47.088
TRAVIS: Stick with the bunny, the bunny's good.

02:20:47.088 --> 02:20:49.103
MARISHA: Yeah, we'll stick with the bunny.

02:20:49.103 --> 02:20:55.569
MATT: The wyvern turns into a bunny
rabbit from underneath its rider and goes (squeak)

02:20:55.569 --> 02:21:00.564
and then plummets, the rider of which
begins to fall as well--

02:21:00.564 --> 02:21:01.867
MARISHA: Bye!

02:21:01.867 --> 02:21:04.128
MATT: -- immediately tossing a grappling hook as it
falls.

02:21:04.300 --> 02:21:06.450
MARISHA: He came prepared.

02:21:06.450 --> 02:21:08.107
LIAM: He's falling so slowly.

02:21:08.107 --> 02:21:12.807
LAURA: That's awesome!

02:21:12.807 --> 02:21:15.017
MARISHA: Thanks. That was my turn.

02:21:15.017 --> 02:21:16.013
TRAVIS: That was slick.

02:21:16.013 --> 02:21:18.595
MATT: All right, that brings us-- So now the
wyverns' turn.

02:21:18.595 --> 02:21:20.489
LAURA: Where did the music go?

02:21:20.489 --> 02:21:22.741
TRAVIS: Why has the music died??

02:21:22.741 --> 02:21:29.411
ALL: (sing battle music)

02:21:29.411 --> 02:21:31.662
MATT: It's coming, guys, don't worry.

02:21:31.662 --> 02:21:34.521
LAURA: (laughs) There it was.

02:21:34.521 --> 02:21:45.596
MATT: This wyvern turns and dives down to catch
its rider, lift it back up onto its back, but it

02:21:45.596 --> 02:21:51.058
uses its entire turn doing so. Wasted their turn
on that element.

02:21:51.058 --> 02:21:54.286
ORION: Wait, what?

02:21:54.286 --> 02:21:56.475
MARISHA and SAM: The wyvern caught his rider.

02:21:56.475 --> 02:21:57.792
ORION: How is that possible?

02:21:57.792 --> 02:21:59.564
LAURA: It happened in like
second-second-second-second.

02:21:59.564 --> 02:22:04.429
MATT: You threw it off the side, and for the
wyvern's turn immediately it dove down, caught the

02:22:04.429 --> 02:22:08.376
rider, and it helped it back onto its back, but
that took its entire turn to do that.

02:22:08.452 --> 02:22:09.519
TRAVIS: Bad wyvern.

02:22:09.519 --> 02:22:11.331
ORION: Okay.

02:22:11.331 --> 02:22:13.037
TALIESIN: But well-trained.

02:22:13.037 --> 02:22:14.237
TRAVIS: Bad. Wyvern.

02:22:14.237 --> 02:22:16.642
MATT: This wyvern is plummeting as a bunny rabbit
now through the air. It's going to attempt

02:22:16.642 --> 02:22:18.578
to make its saving throw.

02:22:18.578 --> 02:22:19.698
TRAVIS: Fail, fail.

02:22:19.698 --> 02:22:20.683
MARISHA: Fail!

02:22:20.683 --> 02:22:23.770
MATT: Does Polymorph allow a saving throw every
round if it's against its will?

02:22:23.770 --> 02:22:24.597
TRAVIS: Fail.

02:22:24.597 --> 02:22:26.951
LAURA: I don't think-- I remember you had to be
damaged, right?

02:22:26.951 --> 02:22:28.638
TRAVIS: Bunny go splat, bunny go die.

02:22:28.638 --> 02:22:30.507
MARISHA: Actually, yeah, I think--

02:22:30.507 --> 02:22:32.048
ASHLEY: Bunny go bye-bye.

02:22:32.048 --> 02:22:33.344
TRAVIS: Thumper's toast.

02:22:33.344 --> 02:22:39.234
MARISHA: It lasts for the duration or until the
target drops to zero hit points or dies.

02:22:39.234 --> 02:22:40.480
MATT: Yeah, so no.

02:22:40.480 --> 02:22:43.114
MARISHA: He just, you know, is a falling bunny.

02:22:43.114 --> 02:22:47.187
MATT: He's a falling bunny. That is going to be
one dead wyvern.

02:22:47.187 --> 02:22:49.782
LAURA: That's amazing. Everything's falling.

02:22:49.782 --> 02:22:52.688
MARISHA: Will you let me know when he hits the
ground, when he falls?

02:22:52.688 --> 02:22:53.587
MATT: I will, don't worry.

02:22:53.587 --> 02:22:54.618
SAM: Well it's the ocean, right?

02:22:54.618 --> 02:22:55.389
MATT: Yeah.

02:22:55.389 --> 02:22:56.658
TRAVIS: You'll hear the guts splat out of it.

02:22:56.658 --> 02:22:57.693
SAM: Might end up not hitting...

02:22:57.693 --> 02:23:01.456
MATT: Terminal velocity for a bunny rabbit. I have
to consider this as a DM now. This is a thing in

02:23:01.456 --> 02:23:02.241
my existence.

02:23:02.241 --> 02:23:06.236
MARISHA: Yeah, it's the same. You throw a penny,
you throw a cow off the Empire State Building,

02:23:06.290 --> 02:23:07.660
they'll both fall at the same time.

02:23:07.660 --> 02:23:12.115
ASHLEY: How high up are we, and how much does the
bunny weigh?

02:23:12.115 --> 02:23:13.651
MATT: It's hard to tell, you cannot make any
details--

02:23:13.651 --> 02:23:14.844
ASHLEY: Let's do the math.

02:23:14.844 --> 02:23:20.370
MATT: You're so far above the ocean that you can
barely make out any details of it, and what you

02:23:20.370 --> 02:23:25.662
can see is so fine in the distance you gather...
you're a long, long way up.

02:23:25.662 --> 02:23:28.195
LIAM: Getting flashes of Holy Grail here.

02:23:28.195 --> 02:23:31.145
MATT: Exactly. So the grappling hook (woo tink)
onto the side here.

02:23:31.145 --> 02:23:32.717
LAURA: Oh no, it's that jerk.

02:23:32.717 --> 02:23:35.595
MATT: The rope swings, and this guy spends his
turn getting up onto the side of the boat there

02:23:35.595 --> 02:23:46.684
and that's his turn. Next, this wyvern here is
going to swoop down. As it does, its rider leaps

02:23:46.684 --> 02:23:57.463
off, landing right there. The wyvern comes over
here and is going to make attacks on you.

02:23:57.463 --> 02:23:58.414
LAURA: No!

02:23:58.414 --> 02:24:05.564
MATT: First it comes back with its bite. It has no
arms, its arms are its wings, it has taloned feet.

02:24:05.564 --> 02:24:12.155
Comes down and bites at you with its giant toothy
maw. That's going to be a 25

02:24:12.222 --> 02:24:13.641
to hit with its bite.

02:24:13.641 --> 02:24:14.954
LAURA: Fudge.

02:24:14.954 --> 02:24:20.189
MATT: So you take 13 points of piercing damage.

02:24:20.189 --> 02:24:21.393
LAURA: All right.

02:24:21.393 --> 02:24:31.002
MATT: It's not going to use its claws, because
instead, as it brings its claws up in a rearing

02:24:31.002 --> 02:24:36.006
position, its tail whips underneath it with this
gnarled pointed stinger at you--

02:24:36.006 --> 02:24:37.547
LAURA: At me still?

02:24:37.547 --> 02:24:40.824
MATT: As you're the one that shot an exploding
arrow at its friend.

02:24:40.824 --> 02:24:41.941
LAURA: Oh, all right.

02:24:41.941 --> 02:24:47.189
MATT: This is going to be-- that's a 20 to hit.

02:24:47.189 --> 02:24:54.611
LAURA: Okay, so my armor class is 19 but I'm
wearing a plus two Ring of Protection.

02:24:54.611 --> 02:24:56.546
MATT: Right, but that's with your--

02:24:56.546 --> 02:24:57.786
LAURA: Is that with the plus two ring?

02:24:57.786 --> 02:24:59.070
MATT: That's with the plus two, yeah.

02:24:59.070 --> 02:25:00.761
LAURA: So it hits me then.

02:25:00.761 --> 02:25:03.852
TALIESIN: I like that little dance, looks quite
nice.

02:25:03.906 --> 02:25:11.185
MATT: So, for that... You take ten points of
piercing damage, and I need you to make a DC 15

02:25:11.185 --> 02:25:16.291
constitution saving throw, as the stinger at the
end of its tail pierces you in the side of your

02:25:16.291 --> 02:25:19.304
torso. And as it does you can feel the venom pulse
in the inside of your skin.

02:25:19.304 --> 02:25:20.396
LAURA: So I have to beat 15?

02:25:20.396 --> 02:25:21.804
MATT: Yeah.

02:25:21.804 --> 02:25:23.597
MARISHA: You got this!

02:25:23.597 --> 02:25:26.003
TRAVIS: Confidently. Roll that shit.

02:25:26.003 --> 02:25:31.892
MATT: No? As the poison pulses through your system
you feel your muscles seize up with this horrible,

02:25:31.892 --> 02:25:33.663
painful, burning sensation.

02:25:33.663 --> 02:25:40.172
LAURA: (exaggerated pain noises)

02:25:40.343 --> 02:25:42.145
TRAVIS: Buffy.

02:25:42.319 --> 02:25:43.969
LAURA: (laughs) Yeah.

02:25:43.969 --> 02:25:49.487
MATT: You take... 26 points of poison damage.

02:25:49.487 --> 02:25:51.165
LAURA: Holy fudge, dude!

02:25:51.165 --> 02:25:52.107
TRAVIS: How much? 26?

02:25:52.107 --> 02:25:52.965
LAURA: 26!

02:25:52.965 --> 02:25:54.245
MATT: 26 points of poison damage.

02:25:54.245 --> 02:25:55.308
MARISHA: Ouch. Ouchies.

02:25:55.308 --> 02:25:56.730
LAURA: I've got to start doing math now.

02:25:56.730 --> 02:26:02.693
MATT: The individual that hopped off of it, now
you can see is a halfling; dressed in dark

02:26:02.693 --> 02:26:09.362
leather, face is obscured, pulls a longbow out.
And pulls out two arrows at once, pulls back and

02:26:09.424 --> 02:26:10.906
(tssk) releases them.

02:26:10.906 --> 02:26:11.916
MARISHA: Oh.

02:26:11.916 --> 02:26:17.264
MATT: One is going for you, Keyleth. The other is
going for Trinket.

02:26:17.264 --> 02:26:19.889
MARISHA: These guys got skills.

02:26:19.889 --> 02:26:23.774
MATT: That is a 22 versus you, Keyleth.

02:26:23.774 --> 02:26:24.843
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:26:24.843 --> 02:26:27.503
MATT: And a 20 versus Trinket.

02:26:27.503 --> 02:26:28.509
LAURA: He's got 20.

02:26:28.509 --> 02:26:31.319
MATT: All right.

02:26:31.319 --> 02:26:32.994
LAURA: Oh no!

02:26:32.994 --> 02:26:35.778
MATT: You take 12 points of piercing damage.

02:26:35.778 --> 02:26:37.109
MARISHA: Okay.

02:26:37.109 --> 02:26:39.405
MATT: Trinket takes five points of piercing
damage.

02:26:39.405 --> 02:26:42.684
LAURA: Okay okay okay... okay...

02:26:42.684 --> 02:26:48.332
MATT: That ends their turn. All right, brings it
to Percy.

02:26:48.332 --> 02:26:51.453
MARISHA: Go Percy, go Percy, go!

02:26:51.453 --> 02:26:55.591
TALIESIN: How far away am I from that wyvern
that's currently attacking everybody?

02:26:55.591 --> 02:26:56.756
MATT: Right there?

02:26:56.756 --> 02:26:57.594
TALIESIN: Yeah.

02:26:57.594 --> 02:27:01.468
MATT: You're right here, so you're about-- roughly
45 feet from him.

02:27:01.468 --> 02:27:07.501
TRAVIS: (sings) Shave and a haircut.

02:27:07.501 --> 02:27:13.032
TALIESIN: This will be funny. Okay, I'm going to
back up and sit down against the back wall of the ship.

02:27:13.106 --> 02:27:14.752
MATT: Okay. Against the doorway.

02:27:14.752 --> 02:27:19.201
TALIESIN: I'm going to pull out the biggest gun I
have. So, I'm going to pull out Bad News.

02:27:19.201 --> 02:27:20.529
TRAVIS: Yes! Fuck yes!

02:27:20.529 --> 02:27:25.750
TALIESIN: I'm going to sit down. I'm going to take
aim and I'm going to do-- I'm going to spend a

02:27:25.750 --> 02:27:30.162
Grit, and try and take a wing shot at this.

02:27:30.225 --> 02:27:31.881
MATT: At this wyvern here?

02:27:31.881 --> 02:27:32.771
TALIESIN: Yes.

02:27:32.771 --> 02:27:33.749
MATT: All right.

02:27:33.749 --> 02:27:34.950
MARISHA: What's a wing shot?

02:27:34.950 --> 02:27:35.976
TALIESIN: Well, we'll see if it works.

02:27:35.976 --> 02:27:36.996
LAURA: Trying to shoot the wing.

02:27:36.996 --> 02:27:37.915
TALIESIN: I'm shooting him in the wing.

02:27:37.915 --> 02:27:44.924
MARISHA: That sounds awesome. Oh. You mean
literally. Right. Sure. Yeah. (laughs)

02:27:44.924 --> 02:27:46.046
TALIESIN: 18?

02:27:46.046 --> 02:27:47.183
MATT: Hits.

02:27:47.183 --> 02:27:48.569
SAM: Just winged him.

02:27:48.569 --> 02:28:04.264
TALIESIN: Okay. 19, 20-- Really? Where's my d12s,
I was not prepared for this. Here we go. 14 points

02:28:04.264 --> 02:28:07.932
of damage, and he has to make a constitution
saving throw.

02:28:08.099 --> 02:28:12.037
SAM: We're just letting that guard die, right?
We're not going to try to...

02:28:12.037 --> 02:28:13.792
LAURA: I didn't realize we could save him.

02:28:13.792 --> 02:28:14.842
TALIESIN: 23.

02:28:14.842 --> 02:28:15.928
MATT: No. Fails that.

02:28:15.928 --> 02:28:19.140
TALIESIN: Okay. That wyvern drops hard, 20 feet.

02:28:19.140 --> 02:28:24.764
MATT: All right. So that wyvern who is roughly
about ten feet up, you shoot it in the wing (psh!).

02:28:24.831 --> 02:28:27.676
It blows a big old hole in the side of its
leathery wing. As you do, the impact sends its

02:28:27.676 --> 02:28:32.080
wing arm crumbling behind it. It spins
uncontrollably in the space and then plummets to

02:28:32.080 --> 02:28:36.940
the ground, on its back, just reaching and
scrambling trying to get back up. So it's

02:28:36.940 --> 02:28:38.659
currently prone on the ground.

02:28:38.659 --> 02:28:40.071
TALIESIN: Boom! All right, thank you.

02:28:40.071 --> 02:28:40.959
MATT: No worries.

02:28:40.959 --> 02:28:42.038
LAURA: Deal with it.

02:28:42.038 --> 02:28:43.106
TALIESIN: And I reload.

02:28:43.106 --> 02:28:44.813
MATT: All right. Scanlan, you're up.

02:28:44.813 --> 02:28:54.608
SAM: Ah! I'll take a few steps towards the action
and I'll cast (sings) Bigby's Hand, Bigby's

02:28:54.608 --> 02:28:59.740
Hand, you know it, shamone. On the griffon.

02:28:59.740 --> 02:29:01.193
MATT: All right.

02:29:01.193 --> 02:29:03.859
SAM: Is he above the boat or just above the
ocean?

02:29:03.910 --> 02:29:07.816
MATT: Currently above the ocean, just near the
edge of the boat.

02:29:07.816 --> 02:29:13.819
SAM: Can I use Forceful Hand, it says I can push.
Do you think I can... twist?

02:29:13.819 --> 02:29:15.073
LAURA: Stop it!

02:29:15.073 --> 02:29:16.263
ORION: Sorry.

02:29:16.263 --> 02:29:17.838
MATT: You know what, you could.

02:29:17.838 --> 02:29:20.254
SAM: So I'm going to dump him over.

02:29:20.254 --> 02:29:23.687
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and make a check with your
bonus.

02:29:23.687 --> 02:29:26.372
SAM: Oh, and this is all through the Hand Cone of
Clarity. Of course.

02:29:26.372 --> 02:29:28.432
MATT: Right, right. So go ahead and roll and add
five.

02:29:28.432 --> 02:29:31.900
SAM: 19 plus five, 24.

02:29:31.900 --> 02:29:39.575
MATT: 19... plus three. So the griffon, all of a
sudden, there's this giant, shimmering Bigby's Hand. As

02:29:39.575 --> 02:29:45.022
you reach out, this gargantuan version of a
Scanlan fist comes rocketing through the sky, the

02:29:45.074 --> 02:29:49.310
fingers unraveling, clutching the griffon. Its
wings seemingly pulled up and crunched for a

02:29:49.310 --> 02:29:54.455
second as it is suddenly (shft) lifted. Its rider
who is holding on to the reins in the front is now

02:29:54.455 --> 02:29:59.119
dangling, and going to attempt to try and hold
on... and rolls a three.

02:29:59.119 --> 02:30:01.706
(cheering)

02:30:01.706 --> 02:30:05.665
MATT: The rider immediately plummets, falls right
towards the edge of the ship.

02:30:05.737 --> 02:30:09.217
LAURA: Hits the railing. Breaks his back.

02:30:09.217 --> 02:30:13.622
MATT: Makes an acrobatics check and manages to
reduce the damage and land on its feet, however it

02:30:13.622 --> 02:30:18.277
does still take nine points of falling damage.

02:30:18.277 --> 02:30:20.257
TRAVIS: Is he a halfling as well?

02:30:20.323 --> 02:30:24.238
MATT: No, this actually seems a very lithe,
elven-looking individual. Like very thin form,

02:30:24.238 --> 02:30:30.194
face and body all covered, appears to be female.
From best you can tell, just from the

02:30:30.194 --> 02:30:31.119
physicality.

02:30:31.119 --> 02:30:32.437
LAURA: She's going down.

02:30:32.437 --> 02:30:34.284
SAM: I'm also going to inspire Vex.

02:30:34.284 --> 02:30:38.473
With just a-- just for her archery skills.

02:30:38.473 --> 02:30:40.379
MATT: Go for it.

02:30:40.379 --> 02:30:50.685
SAM: Okay. (sings) Elvish people in the ship
tonight, everybody just have a good fight.

02:30:50.685 --> 02:30:53.017
(laughter)

02:30:53.017 --> 02:30:56.250
MATT: All right, you get a d10 inspiration dice
for it, for your use.

02:30:56.250 --> 02:30:57.162
LAURA: Yeah!

02:30:57.162 --> 02:30:58.442
ASHLEY: Yeah!

02:30:58.442 --> 02:31:02.077
MATT: So that ends your turn. Pike, you're up.

02:31:02.077 --> 02:31:03.871
ASHLEY: Okay, how long is the ship?

02:31:03.871 --> 02:31:05.750
MATT: The full length of it?

02:31:05.750 --> 02:31:06.926
LAURA: (laughs) Show him.

02:31:06.926 --> 02:31:10.095
ASHLEY: Just so you know what I'm looking at right
now, I'll show you again.

02:31:10.150 --> 02:31:11.382
MATT: (laughs) This ship?

02:31:11.382 --> 02:31:12.323
ASHLEY: This ship right here.

02:31:12.420 --> 02:31:13.337
MATT: This ship right here?

02:31:13.471 --> 02:31:14.268
ASHLEY: Yeah. That one.

02:31:14.338 --> 02:31:15.804
MATT: Sure. Okay.

02:31:15.983 --> 02:31:16.927
ASHLEY: No.

02:31:16.927 --> 02:31:24.690
MATT: I'd say it'd be about 130 feet in-- or 140
feet.

02:31:24.690 --> 02:31:33.235
ASHLEY: Okay, so would you say, maybe this area
would be about like 60 feet?

02:31:33.235 --> 02:31:35.394
MATT: 60 foot radius, you mean?

02:31:35.394 --> 02:31:36.598
ASHLEY: Yeah, how-- where would--

02:31:36.598 --> 02:31:38.906
MATT: A 60 foot radius for you would be... right
here.

02:31:38.906 --> 02:31:39.866
ASHLEY: Okay.

02:31:39.866 --> 02:31:40.849
MATT: Like this around you.

02:31:40.849 --> 02:31:42.710
ASHLEY: Okay.

02:31:42.710 --> 02:31:45.004
LAURA: But you can move.

02:31:45.004 --> 02:31:51.251
ASHLEY: I would like to reach down-- stay where I
am-- and touch the floor of the ship,

02:31:51.251 --> 02:31:54.495
and cast Hallow?

02:31:54.495 --> 02:31:56.109
MATT: Hallow? Okay.

02:31:56.109 --> 02:32:02.678
SAM: I am so hard right now. I mean, Scanlan.

02:32:02.678 --> 02:32:07.362
ASHLEY: Which basically infuses a 60 foot radius
with holy power, and any creatures or anything

02:32:07.362 --> 02:32:09.629
can't harm anything inside the radius.

02:32:09.629 --> 02:32:16.839
MATT: All righty. It takes-- look at the casting
time on the spell.

02:32:16.839 --> 02:32:18.422
LAURA: Oh no.

02:32:18.422 --> 02:32:20.786
ASHLEY: God. Dang it.

02:32:20.786 --> 02:32:22.718
(laughter)

02:32:22.718 --> 02:32:23.644
TRAVIS: 24 hours.

02:32:23.644 --> 02:32:25.389
ASHLEY: Scratch that! Okay, so here's what we're
going to do.

02:32:25.389 --> 02:32:26.384
MARISHA: 24 hours?

02:32:26.384 --> 02:32:31.224
MATT: 24 hours. Hallow works, you take 24 hours
and that land, where you do that, is like that

02:32:31.224 --> 02:32:32.843
until someone dispels it.

02:32:32.843 --> 02:32:34.020
LAURA: Oh wow.

02:32:34.020 --> 02:32:35.517
ASHLEY: Should have done it when we first got on
the ship.

02:32:35.517 --> 02:32:37.399
TRAVIS: It's like with Hermione and her protection
spell.

02:32:37.399 --> 02:32:40.385
ASHLEY: Okay. That's good to know. Would have been
cool.

02:32:40.385 --> 02:32:42.504
MATT: Instead?

02:32:42.504 --> 02:32:50.989
ASHLEY: Instead, I'm going to Guiding Bolt this
guy right here.

02:32:50.989 --> 02:32:52.630
MATT: This guy here?

02:32:52.630 --> 02:32:55.459
ASHLEY: No wait. The flying guy right here.

02:32:55.459 --> 02:32:56.743
MATT: Oh, that one?

02:32:56.743 --> 02:32:57.585
ASHLEY: Yeah.

02:32:57.585 --> 02:33:02.826
MATT: Okay. You currently can't see him,
unfortunately. That is down below the ship because

02:33:02.826 --> 02:33:06.349
it swooped down to pick up the guy who had fallen,
so he is currently out of your view.

02:33:06.349 --> 02:33:08.006
LAURA: (whispers) Guiding Bolt the griffon.

02:33:08.006 --> 02:33:11.549
ASHLEY: Cool. I'll Guiding Bolt-- I can't do that
griffon up there, can I?

02:33:11.549 --> 02:33:15.496
MATT: What's the range on Guiding Bolt? Might be
able to.

02:33:15.496 --> 02:33:16.671
ASHLEY: 120 feet.

02:33:16.671 --> 02:33:17.819
MATT: Yeah, you can get him from there.

02:33:17.819 --> 02:33:18.848
ASHLEY: Yeah, okay. I'll do that.

02:33:18.848 --> 02:33:29.288
MATT: All right. Make your ranged spell attack.
Roll a d20, add that bonus.

02:33:29.355 --> 02:33:32.672
ASHLEY: Oh, man, that's a one.

02:33:32.728 --> 02:33:37.230
MATT: So in your confusion, you reach back to
shoot the wyvern that's on the other side of the

02:33:37.230 --> 02:33:41.828
ship. It's not there, and so while the spell is
releasing itself, you're like, "Crap! That one!"

02:33:41.828 --> 02:33:46.566
And by the time you turn around to redirect the
divine energy blast, it arcs off

02:33:46.566 --> 02:33:48.582
in a random direction.

02:33:48.582 --> 02:33:50.717
ASHLEY: What a fail of a motherfucking turn.

02:33:50.717 --> 02:33:52.525
(laughter)

02:33:52.525 --> 02:33:54.986
MATT: You still have a bonus action.

02:33:54.986 --> 02:33:58.390
ASHLEY: Can I still move, if I use my Sprinter's
Boots?

02:33:58.390 --> 02:34:00.115
MATT: Yeah, you can still move. You haven't moved
yet.

02:34:00.115 --> 02:34:02.652
ASHLEY: Okay, I'm going to Sprinter's Boots over
to Vex.

02:34:02.652 --> 02:34:04.176
LAURA: That's me!

02:34:04.176 --> 02:34:06.534
LIAM: Sprinter's Boots. Sprinter's Boots!

02:34:06.534 --> 02:34:08.134
MATT: With Sprinter's Boots, you can get there.

02:34:08.134 --> 02:34:14.311
ASHLEY: And I'm going to give her a Superior
Healing Potion.

02:34:14.311 --> 02:34:17.169
MATT: Okay. You haven't used it yet, but you have
one.

02:34:17.169 --> 02:34:18.187
LAURA: Okay.

02:34:18.187 --> 02:34:19.456
ASHLEY: Oh, I can't give it to her.

02:34:19.456 --> 02:34:22.079
MATT: She has it. You handed it to her, but she
hasn't--

02:34:22.079 --> 02:34:23.437
ASHLEY: Here's a Superior Healing Potion!

02:34:23.437 --> 02:34:25.066
LAURA: I didn't have one! Thanks, Pike!

02:34:25.066 --> 02:34:26.226
ASHLEY: A potion turn.

02:34:26.226 --> 02:34:28.214
LAURA: I can't wait.

02:34:28.214 --> 02:34:30.490
I'll wait and do it.

02:34:30.556 --> 02:34:31.914
MATT: All right. Top of the round.

02:34:31.914 --> 02:34:33.287
ASHLEY: Wait, so she has to use that on her turn,
then?

02:34:33.287 --> 02:34:34.129
MATT: Yeah.

02:34:34.129 --> 02:34:35.370
LAURA: That's okay. That's okay!

02:34:35.370 --> 02:34:38.243
ASHLEY: All right. Let's just go past this really
fast.

02:34:38.243 --> 02:34:39.817
(laughter)

02:34:39.817 --> 02:34:40.926
MATT: Oh, Pike.

02:34:40.926 --> 02:34:41.679
ASHLEY: Let's move on.

02:34:41.679 --> 02:34:43.005
MATT: That's okay. Vex, you're up.

02:34:43.005 --> 02:34:50.316
LAURA: Okay! You know what I'm going to do? I'm
going to use a Superior Healing Potion, which is

02:34:50.316 --> 02:34:52.871
how many-- what do I roll for that?

02:34:52.871 --> 02:34:58.871
MATT: Superior Healing Potion? That is-- wow, 8d4
plus eight.

02:34:58.871 --> 02:34:59.918
LAURA: Whoa.

02:34:59.918 --> 02:35:06.388
MATT: Yeah, it's a big old heal. She's drinking a
potion that Pike just gave her.

02:35:06.388 --> 02:35:07.938
SAM: Were you hurt?

02:35:07.938 --> 02:35:09.831
LAURA: Uh-huh, actually very severely.

02:35:09.831 --> 02:35:11.067
ASHLEY: I just healed her.

02:35:11.067 --> 02:35:12.654
SAM: Thanks, Pike.

02:35:12.654 --> 02:35:18.392
LAURA: I'm going to add those up in just a second.
That's a lot of adding.

02:35:18.462 --> 02:35:20.184
MATT: (laughs) Oh, d4.

02:35:20.184 --> 02:35:27.233
LAURA: Okay, but first I'm going to-- he's on the
ground, so if I step away from him he doesn't get a--

02:35:27.233 --> 02:35:28.777
MATT: Correct, he is not threatening.

02:35:28.777 --> 02:35:31.262
LAURA: Okay, so I'm going to move away from that
guy.

02:35:31.262 --> 02:35:32.372
MATT: All right.

02:35:32.372 --> 02:35:33.822
LAURA: I'm going to--

02:35:33.822 --> 02:35:34.806
MATT: How far?

02:35:34.806 --> 02:35:41.328
LAURA: Actually, I'm not going to move-- I'm going
to move against the railing around Grog.

02:35:41.328 --> 02:35:42.594
Can I do that?

02:35:42.594 --> 02:35:43.583
MATT: Yeah, you can move around.

02:35:43.583 --> 02:35:49.445
LAURA: Yeah, and I'm going to stand next to Grog
and hope he overshadows me. And I'm going to

02:35:49.445 --> 02:35:53.501
Lightning Arrow the griffon.

02:35:53.501 --> 02:35:57.214
MATT: All righty. Go ahead and roll for attack on
that.

02:35:57.214 --> 02:36:01.792
LAURA: Why do I feel like a griffon will be immune
to lightning attack?

02:36:01.792 --> 02:36:03.486
ORION: No, it's birds.

02:36:03.486 --> 02:36:04.797
LAURA: They're fine, right?

02:36:04.797 --> 02:36:05.824
SAM: Of course.

02:36:05.824 --> 02:36:06.918
ORION: Birds hate lightning.

02:36:06.918 --> 02:36:09.797
SAM: The griffon is grappled, too. Well, not
grappled.

02:36:09.797 --> 02:36:11.407
MARISHA: (laughs) Birds hate lightning.

02:36:11.407 --> 02:36:13.453
LAURA: That is 4d8. Oh, I have to roll to see if I
hit.

02:36:13.453 --> 02:36:14.622
MATT: Roll for the attack, yeah.

02:36:14.622 --> 02:36:17.730
LAURA: Okay, which one looks like a Lightning
Arrow? This, the amethyst, looks like

02:36:17.730 --> 02:36:18.680
a lightning one.

02:36:18.680 --> 02:36:19.879
MATT: There you go.

02:36:19.879 --> 02:36:23.489
LAURA: Okay, that's good, that's 25?

02:36:23.489 --> 02:36:25.009
MATT: 25, yeah.

02:36:25.009 --> 02:36:37.068
LAURA: Okay, so now it's 4d8. 15.

02:36:37.068 --> 02:36:42.844
MATT: 15 points of damage to it? All right. So as
you run around Grog, as you rush around his

02:36:42.844 --> 02:36:47.012
shoulder you grab one arrow, pull it back, nock it
in your bow, and underneath his arm as he's

02:36:47.012 --> 02:36:52.045
reaching up with his axe, you release an
arrow. As you release it into the air, it almost

02:36:52.045 --> 02:36:57.538
seems to spark with energy. Halfway to its mark,
all of a sudden the speed it's traveling at

02:36:57.538 --> 02:37:01.238
increases, increases, increases, and you see
energy begin to (crackle) off the front.

02:37:01.238 --> 02:37:05.683
It slams into the side of the griffon with
a blast of energy and electricity surge through

02:37:05.683 --> 02:37:09.383
its body. The griffon loses about ten feet of
height before it catches itself. You can see this

02:37:09.383 --> 02:37:14.175
giant burn mark on the side of its body. It's
having a hard time keeping itself in the air. It's

02:37:14.175 --> 02:37:15.699
looking pretty rough.

02:37:15.699 --> 02:37:23.702
LAURA: For my second attack, I'm going to have
Trinket charge the elf girl in red.

02:37:23.702 --> 02:37:25.184
MATT: Okay.

02:37:25.184 --> 02:37:28.448
LAURA: Or no, he's going to attack the wyvern
that's on the ground, that makes more sense.

02:37:28.448 --> 02:37:29.513
Doesn't it?

02:37:29.513 --> 02:37:31.042
ORION: Shoot his wing off!

02:37:31.042 --> 02:37:34.639
LAURA: And bash him with his new armor, and you
know do stuff.

02:37:34.639 --> 02:37:36.482
(laughter)

02:37:36.482 --> 02:37:41.652
MATT: All right, so as you fire an arrow, Trinket
turns around and comes forward. Go ahead

02:37:41.652 --> 02:37:43.850
and roll an attack for Trinket.

02:37:43.850 --> 02:37:46.455
LAURA: Okay. I don't know if I've ever attacked
with Trinket.

02:37:46.455 --> 02:37:47.695
MATT: You have before, it's been a while.

02:37:47.695 --> 02:37:48.958
LAURA: It's been a really long time.

02:37:48.958 --> 02:37:50.617
TALIESIN: Like possibly Pathfinder a while.

02:37:50.617 --> 02:37:51.782
MARISHA: Yeah, it's been a while.

02:37:51.782 --> 02:37:52.913
ORION: Yay, Trinket.

02:37:52.913 --> 02:37:54.106
LAURA: And he rolled a one.

02:37:54.106 --> 02:37:56.608
SAM: With inspiration.

02:37:56.608 --> 02:37:59.860
LAURA: With inspiration-- no, it's a one.

02:37:59.860 --> 02:38:00.957
MATT: A one is an auto-miss.

02:38:00.957 --> 02:38:02.283
LAURA: It's a frickin' one.

02:38:02.283 --> 02:38:06.801
MATT: So Trinket goes to attack, the wyvern's on
the ground, it's screeching around, moving its

02:38:06.853 --> 02:38:11.342
body, its tail whips out and strikes Trinket in
the side of the armor, almost piercing it with the

02:38:11.342 --> 02:38:14.633
poisonous stinger. Trinket instinctively--

02:38:14.633 --> 02:38:17.008
LAURA: Oh shit, I forgot I was poisoned.

02:38:17.008 --> 02:38:24.021
MATT: Yeah. It's okay. It ricochets off the armor,
but Trinket instinctively recoils from it and

02:38:24.021 --> 02:38:26.733
foregoes the attack to take a defensive stance.

02:38:26.733 --> 02:38:28.178
SAM: We're not doing well.

02:38:28.178 --> 02:38:32.042
LAURA: I forgot I was poisoned! Shit.

02:38:32.042 --> 02:38:34.093
MATT: These weapons set up.

02:38:34.093 --> 02:38:36.658
LAURA: Oh, I'm going to finish the healing potion
just for now.

02:38:36.658 --> 02:38:43.537
MATT: Okay, go for it. This guard pulls back and
aims the ballista up towards the griffon that's in

02:38:43.537 --> 02:38:52.546
the air, releases the bolt that streaks
through the air. The bolt rushes past the griffon,

02:38:52.546 --> 02:38:56.670
unfortunately not finding purchase, the rope
leading off into the distance. As he sees the

02:38:56.670 --> 02:39:02.710
rope, the entire giant bolt misses, curses and
takes a dagger out and cuts the rope and it just

02:39:02.710 --> 02:39:06.070
disappears out over the side and he goes, spends
the rest of his turn getting ready to prepare for

02:39:06.124 --> 02:39:12.767
a second shot. This one over here currently has
the ready-to-fire bolt, has no means of doing so,

02:39:12.794 --> 02:39:17.635
instead draws a weapon and begins to rush over to
try and join the fray with the wyvern over here,

02:39:17.687 --> 02:39:22.222
he can't quite get all the way over to fight it.
That ends his turn. Vax, you're up.

02:39:22.222 --> 02:39:23.629
TRAVIS: This guy's still alive in the back,
right?

02:39:23.629 --> 02:39:24.658
MATT: Yeah, you just can't see him.

02:39:24.658 --> 02:39:25.940
TRAVIS: Okay. We can't see him.

02:39:25.940 --> 02:39:31.860
LIAM: I'm going to run up alongside Trinket on the
side and stab the grounded wyvern

02:39:31.860 --> 02:39:33.785
two or three times.

02:39:33.785 --> 02:39:36.194
MATT: Okay, you have your boots of haste, so you
can do this, because you have to go up the stairs

02:39:36.194 --> 02:39:41.722
here to get to the next level. Right there. All
right, so now you're up on the--

02:39:41.722 --> 02:39:45.656
LIAM: I'll use keen dagger to start, gets a 23.

02:39:45.656 --> 02:39:47.727
MATT: All right. That hits.

02:39:47.727 --> 02:39:53.576
LIAM: Okay, so that's 11 points of damage plus the
Sneak Attack damage.

02:39:53.628 --> 02:39:55.387
MATT: Oh, this is going to be nasty.

02:39:55.387 --> 02:39:59.034
SAM: Leave some for Grog!

02:39:59.034 --> 02:40:05.526
LIAM: 13 Sneak Attack damage, so that's 11 plus
13, first dagger.

02:40:05.590 --> 02:40:07.306
MATT: Nice, 24 damage.

02:40:07.306 --> 02:40:14.002
LIAM: Second dagger gets a 26.

02:40:14.002 --> 02:40:15.189
MATT: Hits.

02:40:15.189 --> 02:40:23.894
LIAM: Hits. That is a ten of damage and the third
dagger gets a 16.

02:40:23.962 --> 02:40:26.740
MATT: 16 does hit. Go ahead and roll damage.

02:40:26.740 --> 02:40:28.512
LIAM: It does, it does? Very nice.

02:40:28.512 --> 02:40:29.520
MATT: Yeah.

02:40:29.520 --> 02:40:30.974
TRAVIS: Come on, Jersey, roll that shit.

02:40:30.974 --> 02:40:31.814
MARISHA: Yeah, Jersey.

02:40:31.814 --> 02:40:37.285
MATT: Technically all these attacks-- the creature
is prone so you have advantage on these attacks

02:40:37.285 --> 02:40:38.571
too, by the way.

02:40:38.571 --> 02:40:41.004
LIAM: Oh, well. Did they all hit?

02:40:41.004 --> 02:40:44.566
MATT: Yes. Go ahead and roll a second one for this
last one just on the off-chance

02:40:44.566 --> 02:40:46.794
it might critical.

02:40:46.794 --> 02:40:48.157
LIAM: It was less.

02:40:48.157 --> 02:40:49.882
MATT: Okay, so then you're fine, all right.

02:40:49.882 --> 02:40:52.211
LIAM: Should I throw two more? Okay, I'm good with
everything else.

02:40:52.211 --> 02:40:55.269
MATT: So damage on the last one?

02:40:55.269 --> 02:40:59.797
LIAM: Oh, it was... eight.

02:40:59.797 --> 02:41:03.038
MATT: Eight, got you. All right, so as you rush
around Trinket, you come up with your daggers,

02:41:03.038 --> 02:41:08.393
stab-stab-stab, you're jamming it in the side and
you can see the dark black dragon blood spilling

02:41:08.447 --> 02:41:11.735
out of each wound as you're piercing it, it's
screeching out and trying to get back to its feet

02:41:11.735 --> 02:41:14.985
in the process, but you just keep finding each
opening and jamming in with your blades.

02:41:14.985 --> 02:41:19.171
LIAM: And as a bonus action I want to take my hand
under Trinket's ears and go,

02:41:19.171 --> 02:41:21.134
wooga-wooga-wooga-wooga.

02:41:21.134 --> 02:41:24.327
MATT: (laughs) Trinket goes (bear noises) and rubs
into them.

02:41:24.327 --> 02:41:26.516
LAURA: Would you mind healing him? He's low on
health.

02:41:26.516 --> 02:41:31.793
LIAM: Such a glass half empty girl.

02:41:31.793 --> 02:41:47.085
MATT: The griffon is going to take its turn. 40.
It's going to swoop down towards Keyleth. It's

02:41:47.109 --> 02:41:48.805
going to attempt to grapple you.

02:41:48.805 --> 02:41:50.903
MARISHA: I go, Hey friend!

02:41:50.903 --> 02:41:54.401
MATT: Go ahead and make either an acrobatics or
athletics check, your choice.

02:41:54.401 --> 02:41:55.506
TRAVIS: Oh no.

02:41:55.506 --> 02:42:10.464
MARISHA: Let's do athletics. Oh. It's okay. 15.

02:42:10.464 --> 02:42:15.948
MATT: 15? The griffon reaches down, (ksh ksh)
grapples into you with each of its talons and

02:42:16.114 --> 02:42:19.869
lifts up, carrying you and it--

02:42:19.869 --> 02:42:22.322
MARISHA: It's okay guys, I'll be fine!

02:42:22.322 --> 02:42:26.073
MATT: -- shoves you off the side. You begin to
plummet off the side of the ship, you see it

02:42:26.073 --> 02:42:28.250
vanish above you.

02:42:28.250 --> 02:42:29.577
SAM: She'll be fine, she'll be fine.

02:42:29.577 --> 02:42:31.706
MARISHA: I'll be fine!

02:42:31.706 --> 02:42:34.268
LAURA: Look, Keyleth, it's what you wanted.

02:42:34.268 --> 02:42:36.301
MARISHA: This is fun!

02:42:36.301 --> 02:42:38.297
MATT: Tiberius and Grog.

02:42:38.297 --> 02:42:50.763
ORION: So that thing went to go save his dude. I
turn to him, super annoyed, and I go,

02:42:50.838 --> 02:42:55.344
(speaking Draconian) and I use Telekinesis and I 
rip off his wing.

02:42:55.344 --> 02:42:56.921
MATT: Which guy?

02:42:56.921 --> 02:42:58.055
ORION: The wyvern.

02:42:58.055 --> 02:42:59.199
LIAM: All of them.

02:42:59.199 --> 02:43:00.391
LAURA: You can rip off his whole wing?

02:43:00.391 --> 02:43:03.092
MATT: This one here you can't see, it's like far
below the ship because it dove down to catch its

02:43:03.092 --> 02:43:07.819
guy, it's not currently in visible range. Like,
this is off the board, essentially, it's down

02:43:07.819 --> 02:43:08.678
below there.

02:43:08.678 --> 02:43:09.962
ORION: Oh, crap.

02:43:09.962 --> 02:43:11.309
LAURA: Rip all the griffon's feathers off.

02:43:11.309 --> 02:43:16.452
ORION: I don't do any of that stuff. Just pluck
it. This is annoying you.

02:43:16.452 --> 02:43:20.686
MARISHA: Prepare it for dinner.

02:43:20.686 --> 02:43:25.495
ORION: What's going on? Who's this dude over
here?

02:43:25.495 --> 02:43:31.498
MATT: This is one of the riders that managed to
just barely grapple on and pull itself to the top

02:43:31.498 --> 02:43:32.701
of the ship.

02:43:32.701 --> 02:43:34.182
ORION: And this is the elven--

02:43:34.182 --> 02:43:36.468
MATT: This is the elven one who was on top of the
griffon.

02:43:36.468 --> 02:43:37.367
ORION: Okay.

02:43:37.367 --> 02:43:38.879
MATT: It got dumped off by Scanlan.

02:43:38.879 --> 02:43:52.189
ORION: Oh. Let's see. How many between the two...
how many-- what's the distance between-- what's

02:43:52.189 --> 02:43:53.625
this thing right here?

02:43:53.625 --> 02:43:55.631
MATT: That's one of the ballistas at the front.
It's ready to fire, it just hasn't been fired yet.

02:43:55.631 --> 02:43:57.082
SAM: Lotta questions, lotta questions.

02:43:57.082 --> 02:44:05.502
ORION: Oh. That's fun. Okay. I'm going to use my
movement to get around over here-- because that's

02:44:05.502 --> 02:44:07.220
all 60 feet, right?

02:44:07.220 --> 02:44:08.355
MATT: Yeah.

02:44:08.355 --> 02:44:15.827
ORION: Ah, cool. Well then, I'll use-- screw it,
I'll use Telekinesis to pick up that elf and huck

02:44:15.827 --> 02:44:17.014
it right into the ballista.

02:44:17.014 --> 02:44:23.826
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and make your roll, d20 plus
five.

02:44:23.826 --> 02:44:26.290
ORION: Ooh, natural 20.

02:44:26.290 --> 02:44:28.608
(cheering)

02:44:28.608 --> 02:44:38.585
MATT: So you take-- the elf is down, pulling two
blades out, is lifted up in the air and flung off to

02:44:38.585 --> 02:44:43.169
the side. The female form slams into the ballista
from behind, setting it off. You see now the bolt

02:44:43.232 --> 02:44:45.494
just arcs off the side of the boat.

02:44:45.494 --> 02:44:47.821
SAM: Nice.

02:44:47.821 --> 02:44:54.724
MATT: The elf, which, it's currently grappled now
and held against the side, takes seven points of

02:44:54.724 --> 02:45:02.353
impact damage from the full slamming attack. All
right. The ballista was aimed this way.

02:45:02.353 --> 02:45:06.008
MARISHA: Oh, were you trying to skewer him?

02:45:06.008 --> 02:45:07.188
ORION: Yeah.

02:45:07.188 --> 02:45:08.444
MARISHA AND LAURA: Oh.

02:45:08.444 --> 02:45:14.003
ORION: I still do that. I lift him up and do that
instead.

02:45:14.003 --> 02:45:15.471
MATT: Ballista's already fired, though.

02:45:15.471 --> 02:45:16.839
TRAVIS: It's gone.

02:45:16.839 --> 02:45:18.106
LAURA: Yeah, it's gone.

02:45:18.106 --> 02:45:20.084
MATT: I mean, you slam him into it and fire it
off.

02:45:20.159 --> 02:45:23.356
LAURA: That's okay, you still flung him real
hard.

02:45:23.356 --> 02:45:24.833
ORION: Cool, that's my turn.

02:45:24.833 --> 02:45:26.567
MATT: Sorry.

02:45:26.567 --> 02:45:28.225
ORION: It's fine.

02:45:28.225 --> 02:45:30.362
MARISHA: You and Ashley.

02:45:30.362 --> 02:45:31.877
ASHLEY: We had a week off.

02:45:31.877 --> 02:45:34.319
MATT: Yeah, you're getting into the swing of
things.

02:45:34.319 --> 02:45:35.529
ASHLEY: Getting our wiggles out.

02:45:35.529 --> 02:45:37.084
MATT: Grog, you're up.

02:45:37.084 --> 02:45:45.053
TRAVIS: Seeing the wyvern at my feet, I feel that
familiar tremble in my loins and I take my hand

02:45:45.053 --> 02:45:47.556
out of the chain and I go into a frenzied rage.

02:45:47.556 --> 02:45:48.827
ORION: Yay, rage!

02:45:48.827 --> 02:45:52.984
TRAVIS: And I would like to butcher the
ever-living fuck out of that mini-dragon.

02:45:52.984 --> 02:45:55.931
MATT: All right, make an attack. It's starting to
get to its feet now.

02:45:55.931 --> 02:46:02.322
TRAVIS: Oh, hold on, kitty. 15 plus eight is--

02:46:02.322 --> 02:46:05.419
MATT: You still have advantage on it, by the way,
remember, because it's still technically prone.

02:46:05.494 --> 02:46:06.803
TRAVIS: Oh. 23.

02:46:06.803 --> 02:46:08.023
MATT: Hits.

02:46:08.023 --> 02:46:09.621
TRAVIS: 23 again.

02:46:09.621 --> 02:46:10.312
MATT: Roll.

02:46:10.312 --> 02:46:12.226
LAURA: No, you already did it.

02:46:12.226 --> 02:46:13.418
TRAVIS: Natural 20.

02:46:13.418 --> 02:46:15.049
MATT: So hit, critical, and...

02:46:15.049 --> 02:46:16.679
TRAVIS: The third one.

02:46:16.679 --> 02:46:17.711
LAURA: What?

02:46:17.711 --> 02:46:19.259
MARISHA: That makes up for so much shit.

02:46:19.259 --> 02:46:20.838
ASHLEY: Kill him, kill him!

02:46:20.838 --> 02:46:21.883
TRAVIS: 18.

02:46:21.883 --> 02:46:22.613
MATT: Hits.

02:46:22.613 --> 02:46:23.611
TRAVIS: Nice, all three.

02:46:23.611 --> 02:46:25.245
MATT: Hit, critical, hit. So for the first hit?

02:46:25.245 --> 02:46:29.715
TRAVIS: Eight.

02:46:29.715 --> 02:46:32.084
MATT: Eight damage?

02:46:32.084 --> 02:46:32.938
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:46:32.938 --> 02:46:34.027
MATT: Even with the bonus?

02:46:34.027 --> 02:46:35.147
TRAVIS: Yeah, I rolled a one.

02:46:35.147 --> 02:46:37.089
MATT: A one, okay, so eight. Now your critical.

02:46:37.089 --> 02:46:38.939
TRAVIS: Critical, so is that two of these? 2d12?

02:46:38.939 --> 02:46:41.157
MATT: Just roll it once and double the number.

02:46:41.157 --> 02:46:44.958
TRAVIS: Oh, awesome, 19.

02:46:44.958 --> 02:46:48.713
MATT: Add that plus at the end, so whatever you
rolled--

02:46:48.713 --> 02:46:49.738
TRAVIS: 19.

02:46:49.738 --> 02:46:51.025
MATT: You rolled a 19?

02:46:51.025 --> 02:46:52.117
TRAVIS: I rolled a 12 plus--

02:46:52.117 --> 02:46:54.052
MATT: So 12, that's 24 plus seven.

02:46:54.052 --> 02:46:54.919
TRAVIS: Oh, gotcha.

02:46:54.919 --> 02:46:55.915
MATT: So 31.

02:46:55.915 --> 02:46:56.707
TRAVIS: 31.

02:46:56.707 --> 02:46:57.972
MATT: All righty.

02:46:57.972 --> 02:47:02.877
TRAVIS: And the last one. 16.

02:47:02.877 --> 02:47:10.025
MATT: Nice! So you just smack, smack, smack the
giant axe, as with each arc backward you can see

02:47:10.104 --> 02:47:14.813
the blood spray just through the air, it's
spattering part of the ship. It's screeching in

02:47:14.813 --> 02:47:21.545
pain, trying to reach around it for some sort of
purchase. You leave gaping wounds in its side. It

02:47:21.545 --> 02:47:24.425
still seems to be ready to go.

02:47:24.425 --> 02:47:27.344
LAURA: These things are hard.

02:47:27.344 --> 02:47:29.805
MATT: Pretty tough. Pretty tough, these wyverns.

02:47:29.805 --> 02:47:32.024
SAM: Did you take the wyvern or the rider?

02:47:32.024 --> 02:47:33.441
TRAVIS: Wyvern.

02:47:33.441 --> 02:47:34.957
MATT: So Grog, you stay where you are?

02:47:34.957 --> 02:47:37.336
TRAVIS: Yes.

02:47:37.336 --> 02:47:41.668
MATT: All right. That ends your turn. Keyleth, you
are currently falling.

02:47:41.668 --> 02:47:51.428
MARISHA: Before I turn into anything, I take in
the scenery, and I'm like, "This is peaceful."

02:47:51.428 --> 02:47:54.779
MATT: Very serene.

02:47:54.779 --> 02:47:59.288
MARISHA: Nice. And then I turn into an air
elemental (whoosh).

02:47:59.288 --> 02:48:01.804
SAM: Is that a thing?

02:48:01.804 --> 02:48:02.624
MARISHA: Yes.

02:48:02.624 --> 02:48:03.764
TRAVIS: Not a shark?

02:48:03.764 --> 02:48:05.204
MARISHA: Not a shark, I know.

02:48:05.204 --> 02:48:06.526
LAURA: That could be cool too.

02:48:06.526 --> 02:48:07.524
MARISHA: That would be funny.

02:48:07.524 --> 02:48:08.985
TALIESIN: Turn into a flying shark.

02:48:08.985 --> 02:48:10.322
MARISHA: And I'm like, Oops.

02:48:10.322 --> 02:48:11.741
SAM: My head is like a shark's fin.

02:48:11.741 --> 02:48:12.993
TRAVIS: For when this goes in the water.

02:48:12.993 --> 02:48:14.247
TALIESIN: Intelligent flying shark.

02:48:14.247 --> 02:48:19.225
MATT: In my disappointing haste, I forgot to bring
your elemental figures and I apologize.

02:48:19.298 --> 02:48:21.015
MARISHA: It's okay, I'm air. So I'm there.

02:48:21.015 --> 02:48:24.709
MATT: We'll use this, we'll put this around you.
So this is you as an air elemental right there. So

02:48:24.709 --> 02:48:26.294
pretty. You're air.

02:48:26.294 --> 02:48:27.507
LAURA: Around you.

02:48:27.507 --> 02:48:32.544
MATT: Sorry, guys, usually better about that.
Today's been crazy. So you--

02:48:32.544 --> 02:48:34.053
MARISHA: I turn into 'poof.'

02:48:34.053 --> 02:48:38.916
MATT: Now in your natural element, there is no
fall, you stop yourself immediately. You're no

02:48:38.916 --> 02:48:41.554
more than maybe 20 feet below the bow of the
ship.

02:48:41.621 --> 02:48:44.262
MARISHA: Okay, cool. I'm only 20 feet? Awesome.

02:48:44.262 --> 02:48:45.835
MATT: What's your flying speed? As an earth
elemental?

02:48:45.835 --> 02:48:49.040
MARISHA: It's 60. It's the same, like all of them
if you're moving through air and such,

02:48:49.040 --> 02:48:50.002
I'm pretty sure.

02:48:50.002 --> 02:48:52.537
MATT: Your own terrain, 60? Yeah. So you can get
up onto the bow and still have 40 feet to go.

02:48:52.537 --> 02:48:57.312
MARISHA: Okay, so. Who's the nearest bad guy?

02:48:57.312 --> 02:48:59.207
MATT: The griffon that just threw you off.

02:48:59.207 --> 02:49:03.760
MARISHA: Is that a bad guy next to him? Or is that
a guard?

02:49:03.760 --> 02:49:06.336
MATT: That's a bad guy right there. That's a
guard, that's what was riding--

02:49:06.336 --> 02:49:08.754
MARISHA: My air elemental's a big space, right?

02:49:08.754 --> 02:49:09.800
MATT: Yes, a large.

02:49:09.800 --> 02:49:20.455
MARISHA: Okay. So here's what I do. I go up and
I'm like (whoosh) this big dark scary cloud, and

02:49:20.455 --> 02:49:25.340
then I go up and I'm going to do Whirlwind and I
go full tornado.

02:49:25.516 --> 02:49:26.543
MATT: Okay.

02:49:26.543 --> 02:49:28.001
MARISHA: Full twister.

02:49:28.001 --> 02:49:32.896
MATT: This form-- you guys have never seen this
before. All of a sudden, this giant angry cluster

02:49:32.896 --> 02:49:39.009
of elemental energy, this wind, begins to (wind
sounds) like angry eyes almost, based on the

02:49:39.009 --> 02:49:45.645
energy source within, begin swirling in this giant
cyclone. Localized. Both the griffon being pulled

02:49:45.645 --> 02:49:49.208
into it as well as the other creature on the side.
The effects of that?

02:49:49.208 --> 02:49:53.815
MARISHA: They have to make a DC 13 strength saving
throw.

02:49:53.815 --> 02:50:02.888
MATT: All right. The griffon does succeed. This
wyvern-rider does not.

02:50:02.888 --> 02:50:11.940
MARISHA: Awesome. On a failure a target takes 3d8
plus two bludgeoning damage.

02:50:11.999 --> 02:50:13.441
MATT: Nice.

02:50:13.441 --> 02:50:26.558
MARISHA: So I'll do that real quick. That's okay,
so two, one, roll this one. Five. Ten damage.

02:50:26.558 --> 02:50:28.127
MATT: All righty.

02:50:28.127 --> 02:50:33.195
MARISHA: And he's flung 20 feet in a random
direction and knocked prone.

02:50:33.195 --> 02:50:35.598
MATT: All right. A random direction.

02:50:35.598 --> 02:50:38.453
MARISHA: Hopefully it's randomly off the side of
the ship.

02:50:38.453 --> 02:50:47.434
MATT: Random direction. We'll say it's wherever
the four is there. Four. Falls off and actually

02:50:47.434 --> 02:50:49.444
slams into the top of this--

02:50:49.444 --> 02:50:50.487
MARISHA: Wing?

02:50:50.487 --> 02:50:56.022
MATT: -- this wing. It begins to slide off and is
going to attempt to catch itself on the edge of

02:50:56.094 --> 02:50:57.067
the wing.

02:50:57.067 --> 02:50:57.868
TRAVIS: Fail! Fail!

02:50:57.868 --> 02:50:58.741
MARISHA: Fail, fail!

02:50:58.741 --> 02:50:59.594
MATT: Fails.

02:50:59.594 --> 02:51:00.985
(shouting)

02:51:00.985 --> 02:51:03.062
TALIESIN: Save every one of us.

02:51:03.062 --> 02:51:15.632
MATT: Is flung off the side and falls out of view.
Damn, all right. You still have about 40 feet, or

02:51:15.708 --> 02:51:18.451
30 feet of movement at this point.

02:51:18.451 --> 02:51:26.321
MARISHA: Oh wait, and if the target hits like a
wall he takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every ten

02:51:26.321 --> 02:51:27.943
feet he was thrown.

02:51:27.943 --> 02:51:30.475
TALIESIN: I think he's going to hit a lot of
bludgeoning damage when he hits the ocean.

02:51:30.475 --> 02:51:45.464
MARISHA: If the saving throw's successful, the
target takes half the bludgeoning damage and isn't

02:51:45.464 --> 02:51:47.072
flung or thrown--

02:51:47.072 --> 02:51:48.698
MATT: All right, so five damage?

02:51:48.698 --> 02:51:50.305
MARISHA: Yeah, he still takes five damage.

02:51:50.305 --> 02:51:54.209
MATT: Okay. From the buffeting of the wind,
griffon manages to keep itself in place. All

02:51:54.209 --> 02:51:55.411
right. That end your turn?

02:51:55.411 --> 02:51:56.392
MARISHA: That ends my turn.

02:51:56.392 --> 02:51:59.552
MATT: All right. Now it's the wyvern and the
wyvern-riders' turn. This wyvern gets up to its

02:51:59.552 --> 02:52:07.385
feet again, no longer prone. It's going to, after
being stabbed repeatedly and axed repeatedly, it's

02:52:07.385 --> 02:52:20.726
going to angrily strike out... It's going to go
ahead and make a bite attack and a stinger attack.

02:52:20.726 --> 02:52:26.552
Bite attack's going to be at you, Grog, stinger
attack's going to be at Vax, since he's right

02:52:26.552 --> 02:52:29.939
behind him. Bite attack against you, Grog, is
going to be a 22 to hit.

02:52:29.939 --> 02:52:31.219
TRAVIS: That hits.

02:52:31.219 --> 02:52:33.142
MATT: All right. You go ahead and take--

02:52:33.142 --> 02:52:35.330
TRAVIS: Would that be bludgeoning, piercing, or
slashing, by any chance?

02:52:35.330 --> 02:52:36.582
MATT: That would be piercing.

02:52:36.582 --> 02:52:37.797
TRAVIS: I half on that.

02:52:37.797 --> 02:52:41.866
MATT: Yes you do. So you would take 14 points of
damage. You take seven instead.

02:52:41.866 --> 02:52:43.349
TRAVIS: Okay, all right.

02:52:43.349 --> 02:52:49.033
MATT: Because you have too many hit points and
don't like damage. Against-- that's a natural 20.

02:52:49.033 --> 02:52:50.339
SAM: Natural 20.

02:52:50.339 --> 02:52:51.867
MATT: Natural 20 on you, Vax.

02:52:51.867 --> 02:52:55.117
LAURA: Oh no! Twinsie!

02:52:55.296 --> 02:52:58.749
MATT: So I'm going to assume that hits. (laughs)
So Vax, you take--

02:52:58.749 --> 02:53:02.529
LIAM: He's at disadvantage because I'm on Skype?

02:53:02.529 --> 02:53:04.976
(laughter)

02:53:04.976 --> 02:53:06.454
ASHLEY: And wasn't he prone?

02:53:06.454 --> 02:53:07.448
TRAVIS: No, he's up.

02:53:07.448 --> 02:53:08.718
LAURA: He's up now, yeah.

02:53:08.718 --> 02:53:16.285
MATT: All right. So that is, you take 25 points of
piercing damage from the stinger.

02:53:16.285 --> 02:53:17.904
LIAM: Wait, what did he roll?

02:53:17.904 --> 02:53:19.438
TRAVIS: Natural 20.

02:53:19.438 --> 02:53:20.966
MATT: He rolled a natural 20.

02:53:20.966 --> 02:53:22.270
LIAM: A natural 20? Then he hits.

02:53:22.270 --> 02:53:33.399
MATT: Yeah. So you take 25 points of piercing
damage, 25 points of piercing damage, and I need

02:53:33.399 --> 02:53:36.193
you to make a constitution saving throw.

02:53:36.193 --> 02:53:37.223
LIAM: All right.

02:53:37.223 --> 02:53:38.501
LAURA: Roll well.

02:53:38.501 --> 02:53:39.393
ASHLEY: Come on.

02:53:39.393 --> 02:53:44.436
LIAM: I'm doing it. I'm in New Jersey and I'm
rolling for constitution. That's a five.

02:53:44.436 --> 02:53:46.163
MARISHA: To be fair, you're in Jersey, so.

02:53:46.163 --> 02:53:48.229
SAM: It's the birthplace of the Constitution.

02:53:48.229 --> 02:53:50.154
TRAVIS: Yeah, I think that's accurate.

02:53:50.154 --> 02:53:52.403
SAM: No, I think it's Philadelphia, it's
Philadelphia.

02:53:52.403 --> 02:53:58.106
MATT: All right. So you take 29 points of poison
damage as the stinger shoots out from the wyvern,

02:53:58.106 --> 02:54:04.540
pierces you in the abdomen, already stabbing
through your guts, and you can feel it destroying

02:54:04.540 --> 02:54:09.387
a lot of your internal organs, and then all of a
sudden there's a pulse of burning, fiery pain as

02:54:09.387 --> 02:54:15.239
the poison just disperses into your system as it
pulls out of your torso. That's rough.

02:54:15.239 --> 02:54:17.069
LIAM: Yeah, I'm not doing too well.

02:54:17.069 --> 02:54:18.843
ASHLEY: Where are you at?

02:54:18.843 --> 02:54:21.782
LIAM: Well, I'm doing really bad, let's just say
that.

02:54:21.782 --> 02:54:24.492
MATT: That's that wyvern. The other wyvern is
still plummeting as a bunny.

02:54:24.492 --> 02:54:26.335
LAURA: He hasn't hit the water yet?

02:54:26.335 --> 02:54:27.772
MATT: No, you guys are a ways up.

02:54:27.772 --> 02:54:28.698
LAURA: Whoa.

02:54:28.698 --> 02:54:30.558
MATT: This wyvern swings up now with its rider.

02:54:30.558 --> 02:54:33.188
LIAM: I don't feel so good.

02:54:33.188 --> 02:54:35.275
LAURA: Take a healing potion!

02:54:35.275 --> 02:54:40.277
MATT: Does a fly-by here with its movement. Its
rider, who's currently clutching a spear-type

02:54:40.277 --> 02:54:50.574
object, flings it down at the blue crystal. As it
slams into the crystal, there's a spark of energy

02:54:50.574 --> 02:54:57.209
and the blue crystal seems to wink out of magical
energy, its coloration growing dark. The entire

02:54:57.209 --> 02:55:03.968
ship begins to list to one side.
Everyone shifts 15 feet this way.

02:55:03.968 --> 02:55:05.686
SAM: Oh my god.

02:55:05.686 --> 02:55:09.787
LAURA: Wait, which way? Oh, we all shift, so okay,
we're already against the railing.

02:55:09.894 --> 02:55:13.450
MATT: Yeah, on the stairway. Tiberius, I'm going
to go ahead and have you roll an acrobatics check

02:55:13.628 --> 02:55:15.899
to try and catch yourself, because you're on the
stairs when you get knocked off.

02:55:15.899 --> 02:55:16.908
ORION: Nope.

02:55:16.908 --> 02:55:19.078
MATT: So you fall prone, 15 feet there, on the
ground.

02:55:19.078 --> 02:55:23.542
LAURA: Oh no. Can we all Star Trek it?

02:55:23.542 --> 02:55:26.321
MATT: This guy's going to try to catch himself
here.

02:55:26.321 --> 02:55:28.094
ALL: Whoa!

02:55:28.094 --> 02:55:34.118
MATT: Catches himself. This elf here goes to
there. This guy moves 15 feet to there. Keyleth

02:55:34.118 --> 02:55:35.954
isn't touched.

02:55:35.954 --> 02:55:40.274
TALIESIN: You've got to grip the table for that.

02:55:40.274 --> 02:55:41.983
LAURA: Oh yeah, you've got to grip.

02:55:41.983 --> 02:55:45.249
MATT: Wyvern slides and catches itself off the
edge. Pushed there. Pushed to the stairs.

02:55:45.249 --> 02:55:48.326
MARISHA: Is that wyvern flying?

02:55:48.326 --> 02:55:56.439
MATT: I need Grog and Vex to each make... Make a
dexterity check to try and catch yourself on the

02:55:56.439 --> 02:55:58.132
edge of the boat.

02:55:58.132 --> 02:56:00.398
MARISHA: Son of a bitch. Come on, you guys.

02:56:00.398 --> 02:56:01.860
TRAVIS: 21.

02:56:01.860 --> 02:56:04.821
SAM: Vex, I've inspired you.

02:56:04.821 --> 02:56:06.606
LAURA: That's true, but I don't need it.

02:56:06.606 --> 02:56:13.667
LIAM: Do not kill my sister while I'm away.

02:56:13.667 --> 02:56:15.658
LAURA: That's a 29 for me.

02:56:15.658 --> 02:56:19.942
MATT: Both of you guys manage-- you're flung to
the side, hit the railing, your bodies tumble over

02:56:20.017 --> 02:56:24.183
the side, and both Grog and Vex catch the railing
and are now dangling on the side of the ship as

02:56:24.183 --> 02:56:27.492
it's listing to the side. You both look over at
each other with a (sigh of relief).

02:56:27.492 --> 02:56:29.455
TRAVIS: Hi.

02:56:29.455 --> 02:56:30.731
LAURA: Hey.

02:56:30.731 --> 02:56:32.812
TRAVIS: Crazy shit, huh?

02:56:32.812 --> 02:56:41.713
MATT: So that's his action. As the continuation of
its movement, the wyvern comes down towards the

02:56:41.891 --> 02:56:47.511
now caught off his-- knocked away from the reins
of the ship, is going to attempt

02:56:47.511 --> 02:56:50.133
to grapple the captain.

02:56:50.133 --> 02:56:51.223
SAM: Not Damon!

02:56:51.223 --> 02:56:52.887
LAURA: No, not Damon!

02:56:52.887 --> 02:56:55.725
SAM: Oh no, not handsome Damon. Oh, no.

02:56:55.725 --> 02:56:56.953
MATT: Fails his roll.

02:56:56.953 --> 02:56:57.983
LAURA: Damon, no!

02:56:57.983 --> 02:56:59.122
MATT: Is now grappled by the wyvern.

02:56:59.122 --> 02:57:00.715
MARISHA: Son of a fuck, we can't lose our
captain.

02:57:00.715 --> 02:57:04.243
ASHLEY: I can captain the ship if I need to.

02:57:04.243 --> 02:57:06.600
MATT: Reaches the edge of the ship, it doesn't
have enough movement to get him all the way off,

02:57:06.600 --> 02:57:09.659
but is in the process of dragging him off. You can
see the captain is now reaching up, trying to

02:57:09.722 --> 02:57:12.190
fight his way off the wyvern who's dragging him
off the edge of the ship, but that's as far as it

02:57:12.190 --> 02:57:15.567
can go with the rest of its movement, since it had
to move up and over the edge of the ship. That's

02:57:15.567 --> 02:57:16.817
the end of its turn.

02:57:16.817 --> 02:57:17.996
MARISHA: Damn it.

02:57:17.996 --> 02:57:22.046
MATT: I'm going to put it at about there.

02:57:22.046 --> 02:57:26.425
LAURA: Oh no. Everything's falling.

02:57:26.425 --> 02:57:35.892
MATT: It happens. Dedicated little miniatures. All
right. That brings us to... That's all their

02:57:35.892 --> 02:57:42.271
turns. Percy, you're up. The ship now (sliding
sound), this weird object now is just like

02:57:42.271 --> 02:57:44.605
sparking energy at the edge of the blue crystal.

02:57:44.605 --> 02:57:51.440
TALIESIN: I'm going to just hold on to Bad News as
I'm flicking around, I'm going to pull out my

02:57:51.440 --> 02:57:56.251
Pepperbox, I'm going to take a wing shot at that
bastard right there.

02:57:56.251 --> 02:57:57.423
MATT: Right there? Okay.

02:57:57.423 --> 02:57:59.868
LIAM: Do it, Percy, do it.

02:57:59.868 --> 02:58:03.529
TALIESIN: (laughs) 29.

02:58:03.529 --> 02:58:05.692
MATT: 29 definitively hits.

02:58:05.692 --> 02:58:10.513
TALIESIN: That definitively hits. So let's figure
out what we're going to do to this person.

02:58:10.513 --> 02:58:14.480
TRAVIS: Yeah, come on. We got a flat tire.

02:58:14.480 --> 02:58:20.811
TALIESIN: That's nine points of damage plus a 14
constitution saving roll--

02:58:20.811 --> 02:58:24.179
MATT: Which with a five it does not make.

02:58:24.179 --> 02:58:25.922
TALIESIN: So it drops 20 feet.

02:58:25.922 --> 02:58:31.479
MATT: It drops 20 feet, slams into the deck. It
isn't knocked prone, but the captain is slammed

02:58:31.479 --> 02:58:35.549
into the ground as well and is not currently being
held over the edge of the ship. It still has him

02:58:35.549 --> 02:58:41.532
in its clutches, but he's not being dangled over
the edge.

02:58:41.532 --> 02:58:44.468
TALIESIN: He still has him in his claws, though.

02:58:44.468 --> 02:58:45.346
MATT: Yeah.

02:58:45.346 --> 02:58:46.885
TALIESIN: All right, I'll take another shot at
him.

02:58:46.885 --> 02:58:47.722
MATT: All right.

02:58:47.722 --> 02:58:51.571
TALIESIN: I'm going to make this a fire shot. And
I'm going to try to get him to drop him now.

02:58:51.571 --> 02:58:52.720
MATT: Okay.

02:58:52.720 --> 02:58:56.603
TALIESIN: 16?

02:58:56.603 --> 02:58:59.860
MATT: 16, okay. That hits.

02:58:59.860 --> 02:59:06.979
TALIESIN: All right, let me just make sure I'm
doing this right. Yeah, no damage

02:59:06.979 --> 02:59:08.586
but he drops him.

02:59:08.586 --> 02:59:14.684
MATT: Okay. Captain tumbles forward out of its
grasp onto the side. He's prone, but

02:59:14.684 --> 02:59:16.840
he's no longer in the talons of the wyvern.

02:59:16.840 --> 02:59:20.386
TALIESIN: All right, and then I'm going to spend
the rest of my move getting up, getting situated,

02:59:20.386 --> 02:59:24.058
and then moving a little bit, where's my--

02:59:24.058 --> 02:59:28.468
MATT: Yeah, you have 15 more feet of movement when
you get up from-- Well actually, you weren't

02:59:28.468 --> 02:59:30.514
knocked prone, you just slammed into the wall, so
you're fine.

02:59:30.514 --> 02:59:32.568
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm going to move a little bit
further up the--

02:59:32.568 --> 02:59:33.330
MATT: Here?

02:59:33.330 --> 02:59:34.354
TALIESIN: Yeah, like right about there.

02:59:34.354 --> 02:59:35.281
MATT: Okay.

02:59:35.281 --> 02:59:36.774
LIAM: We just hit 4,000?

02:59:36.774 --> 02:59:39.746
MATT: Are you serious?

02:59:39.746 --> 02:59:41.577
MARISHA: We hit 4,000!

02:59:41.577 --> 02:59:43.001
LAURA: Oh my gosh.

02:59:43.001 --> 02:59:44.998
MARISHA: Rap video.

02:59:44.998 --> 02:59:47.068
MATT: You did this. You did this, Zac.

02:59:47.068 --> 02:59:48.102
ZAC: I'm not happy about it.

02:59:48.102 --> 02:59:49.852
(laughter)

02:59:49.852 --> 02:59:50.910
MATT: You guys are ridiculous.

02:59:50.910 --> 02:59:52.232
TALIESIN: Are you proud of yourself?

02:59:52.232 --> 02:59:53.304
ZAC: No.

02:59:53.304 --> 02:59:57.006
MATT: The Snugglelord outfit you're wearing tells
me otherwise.

02:59:57.006 --> 02:59:58.271
TALIESIN: You look proud and majestic.

02:59:58.271 --> 03:00:04.154
MATT: All right, no worries. So Percy, well done,
that's your turn. Scanlan, you're up.

03:00:04.154 --> 03:00:08.286
SAM: Scanlan's going to take a few steps
forward--

03:00:08.286 --> 03:00:12.209
MATT: You still have your hand up, by the way.
It's over in this area. You just took it and

03:00:12.209 --> 03:00:13.456
twisted him, so you can manage to--

03:00:13.456 --> 03:00:14.650
SAM: But he got out of it.

03:00:14.650 --> 03:00:15.418
MATT: Yeah.

03:00:15.418 --> 03:00:20.557
SAM: So I could... I'm going to leave it be. Oh
wait, I still have my hand out? And it's over there?

03:00:20.557 --> 03:00:22.941
MATT: Well, I mean, your hand is over here where
you grabbed it earlier.

03:00:22.941 --> 03:00:26.269
SAM: Can I move it to the other guy near the
ballista?

03:00:26.269 --> 03:00:27.244
MATT: Over here?

03:00:27.244 --> 03:00:28.021
SAM: Yeah.

03:00:28.021 --> 03:00:28.793
MATT: Yeah.

03:00:28.793 --> 03:00:31.032
SAM: Is that going to be my move, or do I also get
to use the hand?

03:00:31.032 --> 03:00:33.181
MATT: No, that's just part of your action, so if
you wanted to use the hand you could--

03:00:33.181 --> 03:00:38.632
SAM: Okay, I move it near the ballista guy and I
just go, boop. Push him over the edge.

03:00:38.632 --> 03:00:41.097
MATT: All right. Go ahead and make a roll and add
five to it.

03:00:41.097 --> 03:00:45.956
SAM: It's through the--ooh. Not good, not good.

03:00:45.956 --> 03:00:47.155
TALIESIN: Inspire yourself.

03:00:47.155 --> 03:00:48.345
SAM: 14.

03:00:48.345 --> 03:00:55.226
MATT: 14. As the creature's slammed into the wall,
the elf that's wrapped up currently is trying to

03:00:55.226 --> 03:01:00.485
get ready. It starts preparing itself to do a
series of attacks, and your Bigby's Hand just

03:01:00.485 --> 03:01:03.718
blindsides it, sending it over the edge of
the railing--

03:01:03.718 --> 03:01:05.505
SAM: Oh, it worked!

03:01:05.505 --> 03:01:13.381
MATT: Does not catch the railing. These guys, I
don't think they knew who was on that ship.

03:01:13.381 --> 03:01:19.800
(falling scream) Gets flung off the edge, unable
to catch, and vanishes over the side of the ship.

03:01:19.800 --> 03:01:22.063
MARISHA: No, Wilhelm!

03:01:22.063 --> 03:01:32.810
SAM: And then-- I'm going to move towards the
captain.

03:01:32.810 --> 03:01:34.242
MATT: All right.

03:01:34.242 --> 03:01:39.474
SAM: And-- Vax, are you in dire straits?
Physically?

03:01:39.474 --> 03:01:40.971
LIAM: (strained) Yes.

03:01:40.971 --> 03:01:44.743
SAM: Okay, then I'm going to throw some healing at
Vax with my Healing Word bonus action.

03:01:44.743 --> 03:01:47.448
MATT: Yeah, you can get him in the range. Just
barely.

03:01:47.448 --> 03:01:50.463
SAM: Healing Word of the day is, Heal!

03:01:50.463 --> 03:01:52.335
(laughter)

03:01:52.335 --> 03:01:55.286
MATT: All right, so go ahead and roll for him,
it's 1d4 plus five I believe.

03:01:55.286 --> 03:01:59.611
MARISHA: It's like a word of the day calendar,
Healing Word of the day.

03:01:59.611 --> 03:02:02.020
SAM: You got healed seven points, New Jersey.

03:02:02.020 --> 03:02:03.980
MATT: Awesome.

03:02:03.980 --> 03:02:06.122
LIAM: Ze goggles do nothing.

03:02:06.122 --> 03:02:10.275
MATT: Ending Scanlan's turn. That was a rough
round for them. Pike, you're up.

03:02:10.275 --> 03:02:11.806
LAURA: Come on, Pike.

03:02:11.806 --> 03:02:13.026
ASHLEY: Okay.

03:02:13.026 --> 03:02:18.716
MATT: No, it's concentration. Once you do Bigby's
Hand, you have it for as long as you concentrate.

03:02:18.716 --> 03:02:20.402
ASHLEY: So.

03:02:20.402 --> 03:02:21.521
MATT: Yes.

03:02:21.521 --> 03:02:24.984
ASHLEY: I would like to try to create a Spiritual
Weapon.

03:02:24.984 --> 03:02:26.067
MATT: All right.

03:02:26.067 --> 03:02:29.221
ASHLEY: Kind of in the vein of--

03:02:29.221 --> 03:02:32.403
MATT: You're a war cleric, now.

03:02:32.403 --> 03:02:35.605
ASHLEY: -- Yondu's little arrow he would whistle
at.

03:02:35.605 --> 03:02:36.830
MATT: Okay.

03:02:36.830 --> 03:02:39.610
ASHLEY: But like a really big spear, like a big
version of that.

03:02:39.610 --> 03:02:43.552
MATT: Okay, so what you do is you glance over at
the bolts that are set up as part of the

03:02:43.552 --> 03:02:47.973
ballistae, and use that as a point of inspiration.
You cast Spiritual Weapon and you can see, from

03:02:47.973 --> 03:02:53.822
the holy symbol, it glows at your chest and out of
it this giant piercing bolt just seems to appear

03:02:53.822 --> 03:02:59.100
out of divine energy. Lifts itself aloft next to
you, just hovering in the air.

03:02:59.100 --> 03:03:02.330
ASHLEY: All right, so I want to pierce it through
that guy.

03:03:02.330 --> 03:03:03.215
MATT: This guy?

03:03:03.215 --> 03:03:04.017
ASHLEY: Yeah.

03:03:04.017 --> 03:03:08.416
MATT: So as you see it there, you bring your hand
up and then make a flinging motion. It spins,

03:03:08.416 --> 03:03:12.891
rotates, and then rockets off in the direction of
this wyvern. Go ahead and roll an attack with your

03:03:12.891 --> 03:03:17.546
spell modifier.

03:03:17.546 --> 03:03:21.492
LIAM: Kill kill kill kill kill.

03:03:21.623 --> 03:03:22.635
ASHLEY: 18.

03:03:22.635 --> 03:03:28.360
MATT: 18 definitely hits. All right, so for the
bolt's damage in the speed of this, and given the

03:03:28.360 --> 03:03:39.769
flight, I would say roll 2d6 plus five damage.

03:03:39.769 --> 03:03:44.684
LIAM: (sings)

03:03:44.764 --> 03:03:46.524
ASHLEY: Seven.

03:03:46.524 --> 03:03:49.205
MATT: Total seven? All right. Aw.

03:03:49.205 --> 03:03:53.583
LAURA: All of those dice are bad. You need all-new
dice.

03:03:53.583 --> 03:03:59.695
ASHLEY: I know, I mean, because of how heavy it
is-- but wait, I want to do it at a higher level.

03:03:59.695 --> 03:04:01.475
MATT: Okay, what higher level do you want to
do it?

03:04:01.475 --> 03:04:04.421
ASHLEY: I was thinking of doing it at a level
four.

03:04:04.499 --> 03:04:05.531
MATT: All right.

03:04:05.531 --> 03:04:10.644
ASHLEY: And I know that does 1d8, but then was it
just 1d6 because--

03:04:10.644 --> 03:04:13.841
MATT: It was 2d6-- well what does the damage say
on there normally?

03:04:13.841 --> 03:04:15.715
ASHLEY: One more time?

03:04:15.715 --> 03:04:17.540
MATT: What's the damage it says on there.

03:04:17.540 --> 03:04:22.311
ASHLEY: Spell using a slot of third level or
higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for every two

03:04:22.311 --> 03:04:23.960
slot levels above 2nd.

03:04:23.960 --> 03:04:25.474
MATT: And what level is it normally?

03:04:25.474 --> 03:04:26.356
LAURA: Three.

03:04:26.356 --> 03:04:27.462
ASHLEY: It's a three. Or no, it's a two.

03:04:27.462 --> 03:04:28.754
MATT: It's a two, so you're casting it at fourth
level.

03:04:28.754 --> 03:04:29.667
ASHLEY: Yeah.

03:04:29.667 --> 03:04:31.145
MATT: Which means you roll an additional 1d8.

03:04:31.145 --> 03:04:33.193
LAURA: Don't roll that. Roll one of these.

03:04:33.193 --> 03:04:37.175
LAURA: Yeah!

03:04:37.175 --> 03:04:38.524
MATT: What's that?

03:04:38.524 --> 03:04:39.812
ASHLEY: Okay, so it would be 15 total.

03:04:39.812 --> 03:04:40.820
MATT: 15 total, nice.

03:04:40.820 --> 03:04:45.672
ASHLEY: But then would the, since, so then would I
roll the d8 instead of the sixes

03:04:45.672 --> 03:04:47.557
for that last one?

03:04:47.557 --> 03:04:52.038
MATT: I would say given the fact that it's a
ranged bolt, it would be-- is it normally just 1d8

03:04:52.038 --> 03:04:53.764
for the damage it deals?

03:04:53.764 --> 03:04:54.729
ASHLEY: Yeah.

03:04:54.729 --> 03:04:56.730
MATT: I made it 2d6 because it's a larger weapon
and you're using it as a bolt.

03:04:56.730 --> 03:04:57.867
ASHLEY: All right, I understand.

03:04:57.867 --> 03:04:59.310
MATT: So it did more damage circumstantially than
it normally would.

03:04:59.310 --> 03:05:00.162
ASHLEY: Okay.

03:05:00.162 --> 03:05:05.982
MATT: You're fine. All right, so that ends Pike's
turn. Brings us up to the top. Vex. You're like on

03:05:06.033 --> 03:05:08.877
the side right now. You're in theory prone on the
side of the ship but you're not falling.

03:05:08.877 --> 03:05:12.181
LAURA: Oh, so I can't attack? If I get up and
out.

03:05:12.181 --> 03:05:14.704
MATT: Well no, you use half your movement to get
back onto the ship.

03:05:14.704 --> 03:05:18.750
LAURA: Okay. I'm going to like brace my foot on
Grog's shoulder and climb up.

03:05:18.750 --> 03:05:20.087
MARISHA: Nice.

03:05:20.087 --> 03:05:23.487
MATT: All right. So she uses you as a footstool
and flips over, lands on top of the ship,

03:05:23.487 --> 03:05:24.969
totally fine.

03:05:24.969 --> 03:05:34.213
LAURA: Awesome. Can I shoot my grappling arrow at
this bastard here at the end of the ship? Is that

03:05:34.213 --> 03:05:35.858
far enough? Is that close enough?

03:05:35.858 --> 03:05:36.687
MATT: Yeah, yeah.

03:05:36.687 --> 03:05:39.391
LAURA: All right, I want to shoot it at the rider,
I want to shoot the grappling arrow at the rider.

03:05:39.391 --> 03:05:41.085
And I'll catch him and bring him in.

03:05:41.085 --> 03:05:43.306
MATT: All right. So you reach in and there's--

03:05:43.306 --> 03:05:45.358
LAURA: Oh, cast Hunter's Mark on him first,
though.

03:05:45.358 --> 03:05:49.123
MATT: So you move it over.

03:05:49.123 --> 03:05:52.027
LAURA: Yeah, that fucking, yeah.

03:05:52.027 --> 03:05:54.195
MATT: It's there, Hunter's Mark is there, we're
fine.

03:05:54.195 --> 03:05:56.899
LAURA: Yeah, it's on it, yay.

03:05:56.899 --> 03:05:59.352
MATT: All right. Go ahead and roll for the attack
as you pull back the grappling arrow.

03:05:59.352 --> 03:06:02.285
LAURA: Oh god, okay. So nervous.

03:06:02.285 --> 03:06:03.983
TALIESIN: I'm counting on you.

03:06:03.983 --> 03:06:05.357
ORION: Hit it!

03:06:05.357 --> 03:06:07.907
LAURA: Yes. 26.

03:06:07.907 --> 03:06:09.358
MATT: 26 definitely hits.

03:06:09.358 --> 03:06:11.056
LAURA: Okay. So how do I do it?

03:06:11.056 --> 03:06:12.594
MATT: All right. So roll damage.

03:06:12.594 --> 03:06:13.427
LAURA: Okay.

03:06:13.427 --> 03:06:22.604
MATT: It's actually-- for the grappling arrow it's
going to be 1d6 damage for it. It's not quite as

03:06:22.682 --> 03:06:27.308
designed to pierce more than it's more of a
bludgeoning hit. Plus your--

03:06:27.308 --> 03:06:28.354
LAURA: Plus my regular?

03:06:28.354 --> 03:06:29.612
MATT: Yeah.

03:06:29.612 --> 03:06:30.736
LAURA: 13.

03:06:30.736 --> 03:06:32.206
MATT: So 13 damage to the rider, all right.

03:06:32.206 --> 03:06:33.965
LAURA: Plus six for the Hunter's Mark. One.

03:06:33.965 --> 03:06:35.965
MATT: All right.

03:06:35.965 --> 03:06:40.304
LAURA: And then I've got him grappled?

03:06:40.353 --> 03:06:46.560
MATT: And so as the arrow hits, it pierces the
shoulder for a second, it causes it to push off

03:06:46.560 --> 03:06:52.242
the shoulder as it retracts behind it. You pull
back and it catches the shoulder. You're yanking?

03:06:52.242 --> 03:06:54.183
LAURA: Yeah, for my second action I want to pull
him off.

03:06:54.183 --> 03:06:56.136
MATT: All right, go ahead and make an athletics
check.

03:06:56.136 --> 03:06:56.921
LAURA: Okay.

03:06:56.921 --> 03:06:57.755
MARISHA: Nice!

03:06:57.755 --> 03:06:58.523
TALIESIN: Yes!

03:06:58.523 --> 03:06:59.465
MARISHA: Tug-of-war.

03:06:59.465 --> 03:07:00.543
TALIESIN: Batman.

03:07:00.543 --> 03:07:01.693
MARISHA: Batman.

03:07:01.693 --> 03:07:05.035
SAM: You've got inspiration.

03:07:05.035 --> 03:07:12.315
LAURA: Oh, well, okay. 16. Should I use my
inspiration? Yeah?

03:07:12.315 --> 03:07:13.713
TRAVIS: Do it!

03:07:13.713 --> 03:07:14.839
MARISHA: Do it!

03:07:14.839 --> 03:07:16.731
LAURA: Okay, so that's 23.

03:07:16.731 --> 03:07:21.766
MATT: 23. So using the inspiration that Scanlan
had given you, you grab the arrow and yank with

03:07:21.766 --> 03:07:26.579
all your might. The tiny halfling form on there
clutches for dear life onto the harness that is on

03:07:26.579 --> 03:07:31.963
top of this wyvern, but it's not enough as its
fingers are pulled from its grip and it's yanked

03:07:31.963 --> 03:07:37.452
off the front, toppling ass over teakettle,
landing prone on the ground next to the captain

03:07:37.452 --> 03:07:39.271
that it attempted to fling from the side of the
ship.

03:07:39.271 --> 03:07:40.360
LAURA: Yes!

03:07:40.360 --> 03:07:42.482
MATT: Grappling hook partially embedded in the
back of its shoulder blade.

03:07:42.482 --> 03:07:43.511
TRAVIS: Outstanding.

03:07:43.511 --> 03:07:44.564
ASHLEY: Yeah!

03:07:44.564 --> 03:07:46.200
LAURA: I'm still holding the rope-- holding on.

03:07:46.200 --> 03:07:50.222
MATT: You are, yes. All right.

03:07:50.222 --> 03:07:52.147
LAURA: That's my whole action, right? That's
everything I can do?

03:07:52.147 --> 03:07:54.708
MATT: That would be your action, yeah. That whole
process.

03:07:54.708 --> 03:07:56.775
LAURA: Okay.

03:07:56.775 --> 03:08:00.032
SAM: (sings) This is the music that plays when
things get really exciting.

03:08:00.032 --> 03:08:07.719
MATT: (laughs) All right. This guard comes over
here, returns to his base where he had set up. The

03:08:07.719 --> 03:08:11.453
griffon is right there in front of him. He gets
the bolt that's been set up there, aims it up, and

03:08:11.453 --> 03:08:14.333
is going to fire almost point-blank into the
griffon as it turns around.

03:08:14.333 --> 03:08:15.921
SAM: And he misses.

03:08:15.921 --> 03:08:16.886
MARISHA: Come on.

03:08:16.886 --> 03:08:17.891
MATT: That's a natural 20.

03:08:17.891 --> 03:08:19.031
(cheering)

03:08:19.031 --> 03:08:20.278
TALIESIN: Way to go, nameless guard!

03:08:20.278 --> 03:08:21.425
LAURA: Yeah, go NPC!

03:08:21.425 --> 03:08:22.920
MATT: And 2d6, double sixes.

03:08:22.920 --> 03:08:27.500
MARISHA: You're a badass, nameless NPC.

03:08:27.500 --> 03:08:34.728
MATT: So as the guard turns around and releases
the bolt, the griffon is flying up over the edge

03:08:34.728 --> 03:08:39.269
of the ship, getting away from the buffeting winds
of the druid. As it turns around, a bolt just

03:08:39.269 --> 03:08:44.528
pierces its chest, the sheer impact sending it
flying backward as it screeches, plummets off the

03:08:44.528 --> 03:08:49.923
side of the ship to slowly find itself to its doom
in the watery grave below in the ocean.

03:08:49.923 --> 03:08:51.593
LAURA: Next to a tiny rabbit swimming around.

03:08:51.593 --> 03:08:59.882
MATT: Next to a tiny rabbit. That griffon took a
bolt to its chest, that is nasty. All right. This

03:08:59.882 --> 03:09:02.486
other guard is going to--

03:09:02.486 --> 03:09:06.322
LAURA: And the Hunter's Mark is on the little
halfling thing, not the wyvern, just so you know.

03:09:06.322 --> 03:09:08.040
MATT: Yes.

03:09:08.040 --> 03:09:15.002
LAURA: Oh no, our music went away again.

03:09:15.002 --> 03:09:17.811
MARISHA: Is that like the only track we have?

03:09:18.030 --> 03:09:20.433
MATT: One track is having problems with
audio, apparently. I'll fix it later.

03:09:20.433 --> 03:09:23.136
SAM: Matt, do everything now.

03:09:23.136 --> 03:09:26.536
MATT: I know. By the way, we have some great audio
tracks that some fans have sent that I'm going to

03:09:26.536 --> 03:09:28.047
be incorporating into our playlist soon.

03:09:28.047 --> 03:09:28.820
LAURA: Oh, that's cool!

03:09:28.820 --> 03:09:31.173
MATT: So if any of you guys are musicians and you
want to create music for the show, feel free to

03:09:31.173 --> 03:09:35.783
send it to us. You know, atmospheric, not too
dynamic, you've heard the types we have on here,

03:09:35.783 --> 03:09:37.637
so in that realm, please send it.

03:09:37.637 --> 03:09:39.028
SAM: Polka, polka. Lots of polka.

03:09:39.028 --> 03:09:41.301
TRAVIS: Slow jams.

03:09:41.301 --> 03:09:42.851
LAURA: Slow jams for Scanlan in the boudoir.

03:09:42.851 --> 03:09:44.460
LIAM: Ska, we've been getting a lot of ska.

03:09:44.460 --> 03:09:45.525
TALIESIN: Dubstep.

03:09:45.525 --> 03:09:46.792
MATT: All right. Vax, you're up.

03:09:46.792 --> 03:09:49.398
LIAM: I'm having trouble seeing through the fog of
war, a.k.a. my iPad. How close is

03:09:49.398 --> 03:09:51.168
that wyvern to me?

03:09:51.168 --> 03:09:54.692
MATT: Right there? He is only ten, 11 feet from
you.

03:09:54.692 --> 03:09:58.646
LIAM: All right. Okay, so straight up,
dagger-dagger-dagger.

03:09:58.646 --> 03:09:59.846
MATT: All right.

03:09:59.846 --> 03:10:01.747
LIAM: Do I have advantage?

03:10:01.747 --> 03:10:03.606
MATT: No, you do not have advantage. It is
flying.

03:10:03.783 --> 03:10:05.716
LIAM: All right, that's 20 on the first with my
keen.

03:10:05.716 --> 03:10:07.149
MATT: That hits.

03:10:07.149 --> 03:10:13.620
LIAM: Hits. That is ten points of damage. Second
dagger, 25.

03:10:13.620 --> 03:10:15.240
MATT: That hits.

03:10:15.240 --> 03:10:22.864
LIAM: That is seven points of damage, and my third
dagger, all the way from New Jersey, is a 20.

03:10:22.864 --> 03:10:24.093
MATT: That hits.

03:10:24.093 --> 03:10:25.639
SAM: Trenton.

03:10:25.639 --> 03:10:29.352
LIAM: They were really all ones. That is a ten.

03:10:29.352 --> 03:10:33.618
MATT: Ten damage, all right. So as you just manage
to catch yourself on the edge of the ship as it's

03:10:33.618 --> 03:10:37.785
listing. From this angle, the wyvern that pushed
off the side is now flapping its wings and

03:10:37.785 --> 03:10:42.010
preparing its claws to go for another dive attack.
You reach back and your daggers, which have

03:10:42.010 --> 03:10:47.619
returned to your belt, you fling
all three as they spiral through the air. First

03:10:47.619 --> 03:10:52.567
one strikes its torso, the second one hits it in
the neck, and as it rears up, looking at you angrily

03:10:52.567 --> 03:10:56.911
with its fangs bared like it's now changed its
direction towards you, the final one hits it in

03:10:56.972 --> 03:11:01.091
the head. Plummets backward.

03:11:01.091 --> 03:11:04.911
LIAM: That's how we do it in Weehawken, New Jersey
motherfucker!

03:11:04.981 --> 03:11:10.635
MATT: All right. Vax, do you want to move, are you
good there?

03:11:10.635 --> 03:11:21.858
LIAM: I am going to-- no I'm going to jog
backwards towards the-- I can't see. Who's around

03:11:21.858 --> 03:11:24.812
the wyvern up at the end of the boat?

03:11:24.812 --> 03:11:25.678
TRAVIS: Nobody.

03:11:25.678 --> 03:11:26.611
SAM: Scanlan? Oh.

03:11:26.611 --> 03:11:27.538
MATT: Nobody over here.

03:11:27.538 --> 03:11:28.494
TRAVIS: Nobody's at the front.

03:11:28.494 --> 03:11:29.505
LIAM: Nobody at the back?

03:11:29.505 --> 03:11:30.361
SAM: The back?

03:11:30.361 --> 03:11:31.182
MATT: No, there is--

03:11:31.182 --> 03:11:32.197
LAURA: A little halfling dude.

03:11:32.197 --> 03:11:34.213
MATT: One of the bandits is still there on the
side of the ship.

03:11:34.213 --> 03:11:36.701
LIAM: I have a potion, I'm going to drink it.

03:11:36.701 --> 03:11:37.760
MATT: All right, go for it.

03:11:37.760 --> 03:11:39.852
MARISHA: Is that bandit hanging on, is that the
deal?

03:11:39.852 --> 03:11:43.391
MATT: Technically it's an action to drink it, but
it's fine, I'll let you do it.

03:11:43.391 --> 03:11:44.968
LAURA: You're in New Jersey.

03:11:44.968 --> 03:11:48.758
LIAM: No no no, I don't want to do that. No, I
definitely don't want to do that. I'm going to run

03:11:48.758 --> 03:11:51.347
over by-- I'm going to run back by Keyleth.

03:11:51.347 --> 03:11:58.480
MATT: Okay. With Haste, you get there easily.
Keyleth, who is just a buffeting wind cyclone.

03:11:58.545 --> 03:12:03.477
MARISHA: Come be protected by my sweet wind gusts,
yo.

03:12:03.477 --> 03:12:04.997
MATT: Tiberius, you're up.

03:12:04.997 --> 03:12:06.843
ORION: Okay. I take my staff--

03:12:06.843 --> 03:12:08.133
MATT: Get up to your feet, yep.

03:12:08.133 --> 03:12:17.766
ORION: -- push myself up. I'll-- I don't know,
guys, I don't--

03:12:17.820 --> 03:12:20.538
LAURA: Do something to that big wyvern. Get rid of
him.

03:12:20.538 --> 03:12:22.233
MATT: The entire ship is right here listing on the
side.

03:12:22.233 --> 03:12:22.966
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:12:22.966 --> 03:12:23.910
ORION: Get rid of the wyvern?

03:12:23.910 --> 03:12:24.959
LIAM: Do something amazing.

03:12:24.959 --> 03:12:26.173
LAURA: All we've got are two little bandits after
that.

03:12:26.173 --> 03:12:27.940
SAM: Just do the best move you've ever done in
your life.

03:12:27.940 --> 03:12:36.972
ORION: Okay. I'm going to-- first I'll do
Telekinesis again to attempt to do what I did the

03:12:36.972 --> 03:12:42.077
first time. Nothing fancy because whatever, and
I'll try and rip off the wyvern's wings again from

03:12:42.077 --> 03:12:43.768
his body.

03:12:43.768 --> 03:12:44.819
MATT: Okay.

03:12:44.819 --> 03:12:46.496
ORION: Or one of them, if it's easier.

03:12:46.496 --> 03:12:48.593
MATT: All right. Go ahead and make a roll.

03:12:48.593 --> 03:12:49.891
TRAVIS: Yeah, one would do it.

03:12:49.891 --> 03:12:51.176
MARISHA: True.

03:12:51.176 --> 03:12:56.151
ORION: That is 22.

03:12:56.151 --> 03:13:02.551
MATT: 22. Okay. Go ahead and roll 3d6 points of
damage. You don't manage to tear the wing off, but

03:13:02.551 --> 03:13:07.914
you do manage to pull its flesh, and you can see
you've caused the joint where it's attached now

03:13:07.965 --> 03:13:11.517
tearing open, revealing bone and fleshy tissue
beneath.

03:13:11.517 --> 03:13:15.874
ORION: That'll be nine, ten.

03:13:15.874 --> 03:13:18.750
MARISHA: That's like the most average, that was
like exactly average.

03:13:18.750 --> 03:13:20.207
ORION: Yeah. Ten.

03:13:20.207 --> 03:13:21.689
MATT: It's tearing open.

03:13:21.689 --> 03:13:28.230
ORION: And I see that and I turn to Vax and I go,
I like what you were doing earlier. And I spend

03:13:28.230 --> 03:13:35.013
five sorcerer points, I cast Telekinesis again,
and I take out eight of the daggers that are in my

03:13:35.013 --> 03:13:42.150
pouch and I hover them around me and then I start
(stabbing noises) towards the wyvern where I see

03:13:42.150 --> 03:13:44.072
all the bone shit is.

03:13:44.072 --> 03:13:45.376
MARISHA: He's making sushi.

03:13:45.376 --> 03:13:49.443
ORION: And I'm hucking my-- back and forth,
bringing them back and forth.

03:13:49.443 --> 03:13:51.501
MATT: Just so you're aware, Telekinesis is a
concentration spell, you don't have to keep

03:13:51.501 --> 03:13:52.871
recasting it.

03:13:52.871 --> 03:13:54.339
ORION: Oh, I don't? It's just going?

03:13:54.339 --> 03:13:55.477
MATT: Yeah.

03:13:55.477 --> 03:14:00.656
ORION: Oh, well then. Fucking that's what's going
on, and I spend five to do it again.

03:14:00.656 --> 03:14:02.314
MATT: Just letting you know. Okay.

03:14:02.314 --> 03:14:03.928
ORION: Because can I do that all in one action? Do
that and then with the daggers?

03:14:03.928 --> 03:14:09.246
MATT: I mean, no no. To do the daggers you would
have to cast it again, the sorcerer points give

03:14:09.246 --> 03:14:10.394
you another action.

03:14:10.394 --> 03:14:11.608
ORION: That's okay, so I did it right.

03:14:11.608 --> 03:14:12.511
MATT: All right.

03:14:12.511 --> 03:14:13.445
ORION: Yeah, so.

03:14:13.445 --> 03:14:16.112
MATT: But it wouldn't use another expenditure, yeah.
Normally you can just concentrate each round, do

03:14:16.180 --> 03:14:17.252
an action with it, so.

03:14:17.252 --> 03:14:18.268
ORION: Got it.

03:14:18.268 --> 03:14:19.803
MATT: All right, so you just fling all the daggers
at it?

03:14:19.803 --> 03:14:24.257
ORION: Yeah, and I'm pulling them back and forth
through that tear in the wing

03:14:24.257 --> 03:14:26.214
which I just caused.

03:14:26.214 --> 03:14:32.932
MATT: Okay. I'll say, go ahead and make four spell
attack rolls. So roll a d20, adding your spell

03:14:32.987 --> 03:14:34.878
attack modifier.

03:14:34.878 --> 03:14:35.951
ORION: Four times?

03:14:35.951 --> 03:14:42.001
MATT: Yeah. So whatever your spell attack modifier
is.

03:14:42.001 --> 03:14:47.170
ORION: So my attack modifier is, the spell attack
bonus, is that what I want?

03:14:47.170 --> 03:14:48.116
MATT: Yeah.

03:14:48.116 --> 03:14:52.831
ORION: That's 23, 24, 25, 26. And that's-- what is
that?

03:14:52.831 --> 03:14:55.371
SAM: Wait, is it just the d20 plus the modifier?

03:14:55.371 --> 03:14:56.382
MATT: Yeah.

03:14:56.382 --> 03:14:57.328
SAM: Okay.

03:14:57.328 --> 03:14:58.810
ORION: Yeah, and then 18 plus--

03:14:58.810 --> 03:15:00.739
SAM: That's 20.

03:15:00.739 --> 03:15:05.284
ORION: That's 30, 31, 32. Because I get plus three
on all attacks because of the gear I'm wearing

03:15:05.284 --> 03:15:12.389
also. And then seven plus that is 18, 21, and then
that is 15, 17, 18.

03:15:12.458 --> 03:15:14.185
LAURA: I have no idea what's happening anymore.

03:15:14.185 --> 03:15:16.745
TRAVIS: That's a lot of numbers. Lot of numbers.

03:15:16.745 --> 03:15:20.507
ORION: So my spell attack bonus is 11. Plus three
because of all the gear I have on.

03:15:20.507 --> 03:15:21.893
ASHLEY: I'm getting a donut.

03:15:21.893 --> 03:15:25.934
ORION: On top of those. That goes to my spell
attack bonus. Which is what this is, right?

03:15:25.934 --> 03:15:30.428
MATT: Right, well, your bonus is, it's your
proficiency modifier plus your stat modifier,

03:15:30.428 --> 03:15:35.388
which is your charisma, which is five, and your
proficiency, which is four. So it would be nine.

03:15:35.388 --> 03:15:38.051
ORION: So how do I have-- oh! I'm sorry.

03:15:38.051 --> 03:15:39.304
MARISHA: Maybe you were counting this in.

03:15:39.304 --> 03:15:41.928
ORION: I'm counting this in. So minus one from all
those totals.

03:15:41.928 --> 03:15:51.585
MATT: That's okay, they all still hit. So go ahead
and roll 4d4 plus 20. As each dagger is now being

03:15:51.585 --> 03:15:56.656
jammed into the creature's open wound through the
power of your telekinetic force.

03:15:56.656 --> 03:16:03.603
ORION: That's-- three, 13, eight? Eight?

03:16:03.603 --> 03:16:05.537
MATT: 20, total of 28.

03:16:05.537 --> 03:16:07.497
ORION: Okay, yeah, 28.

03:16:07.497 --> 03:16:12.907
MATT: Takes plus five to each, so 28 points of
damage. As its wing is being torn apart, the

03:16:12.907 --> 03:16:16.784
daggers do streak through, many of which are
missing its form as you're just flinging them all

03:16:16.784 --> 03:16:21.145
at it, and then as they go straight past it, you
turn the Telekinesis back and you yank them back

03:16:21.145 --> 03:16:25.179
through. As they tear through, you see most of the
wing is torn open and the flesh is now just

03:16:25.179 --> 03:16:29.956
exposed to the air, the wind's buffeting it
around. It's looking extremely rough and is

03:16:29.956 --> 03:16:34.888
beginning-- it's on the ground currently, but it
looks like it's not going to be able to fly right

03:16:34.888 --> 03:16:37.428
now. It is completely incapable of flight with the
way you damaged the wing.

03:16:37.428 --> 03:16:43.763
ORION: As I see this, I'm going to just hover all
the daggers over the prone dude and right over his

03:16:43.763 --> 03:16:45.215
face to keep him there.

03:16:45.215 --> 03:16:46.916
MATT: All right. Grog.

03:16:46.916 --> 03:16:50.422
TRAVIS: I pull myself back up on the ship.

03:16:50.422 --> 03:16:52.559
MATT: Okay, so that's half your movement, you
still have 20 feet of movement.

03:16:52.559 --> 03:16:57.178
TRAVIS: I look up and I see that everyone's got
that wyvern taken care of, and I turn my gaze back

03:16:57.178 --> 03:17:03.148
to that little halfling in front of Vex. I'd like
to move to him, please.

03:17:03.148 --> 03:17:06.664
MATT: All right. He is ten feet up, so you're
going to have to make a couple-- two athletics

03:17:06.664 --> 03:17:09.271
checks to leap up towards him in your rage.

03:17:09.271 --> 03:17:10.777
SAM: Two athletics checks.

03:17:10.777 --> 03:17:15.067
TRAVIS: Yes! Okay. 23?

03:17:15.067 --> 03:17:16.942
MATT: All right, and the second one?

03:17:16.942 --> 03:17:19.999
TRAVIS: Yes! Sorry. 19.

03:17:19.999 --> 03:17:28.012
MATT: All right. Like a lumbering barbarian, you
get up on the thing and then just Hulk-jump twice,

03:17:28.012 --> 03:17:30.290
landing next to it, as--

03:17:30.290 --> 03:17:37.100
TRAVIS: Trembling, raging in the face, I reach and
I pick him up by the top of his shirt, give him a

03:17:37.100 --> 03:17:40.726
sniff, and fucking chuck him off the side of the
ship.

03:17:40.726 --> 03:17:43.327
MATT: All right. Make another athletics check to
try and grapple him.

03:17:43.327 --> 03:17:52.601
TRAVIS: Do I get advantage on strength checks when
I'm raging? Advantage on strength checks, strength

03:17:52.601 --> 03:17:53.948
saving throws?

03:17:53.948 --> 03:17:56.152
MATT: Does it give you bonuses, or advantage on
strength checks?

03:17:56.152 --> 03:17:57.459
TRAVIS: Yes, when I rage. It says strength
checks.

03:17:57.459 --> 03:17:58.459
MATT: Yeah, you would.

03:17:58.459 --> 03:17:59.296
TRAVIS: Okay.

03:17:59.296 --> 03:18:00.893
MATT: So yeah, you would have an advantage on
this.

03:18:00.893 --> 03:18:04.858
TRAVIS: (laughs) That's even better, that's a 24.

03:18:04.858 --> 03:18:11.422
MATT: 24. All right. So as you stand there with
your axe up, you set the axe down, reach out and

03:18:11.422 --> 03:18:17.379
grab the halfling, who you see has this scarred
face and it looks really haggard for a halfling.

03:18:17.379 --> 03:18:22.112
Its existence is not in the most comfortable
places, especially to be out in the middle of the

03:18:22.112 --> 03:18:27.903
ocean like this. You grab it and for a moment its
anger, seething, turns to sudden fear as it looks

03:18:27.903 --> 03:18:29.870
over the side.

03:18:29.870 --> 03:18:31.905
TRAVIS: You fucked up!

03:18:31.905 --> 03:18:34.558
MATT: And just goes plummeting off the side.

03:18:34.558 --> 03:18:35.477
LAURA: Oh man.

03:18:35.477 --> 03:18:37.164
TALIESIN: Poor life choices, yay!

03:18:37.164 --> 03:18:39.035
MARISHA: Why did I get in this line of work?

03:18:39.035 --> 03:18:41.038
TRAVIS: Can we interrogate the last one?

03:18:41.038 --> 03:18:43.629
LAURA: Yeah, I think we don't attack the last
dude, just kill the wyvern.

03:18:43.629 --> 03:18:45.015
TRAVIS: I'm good.

03:18:45.015 --> 03:18:46.381
MATT: All right. Keyleth.

03:18:46.381 --> 03:18:53.089
MARISHA: So everyone seems-- the only thing that's
left is the wyvern, right?

03:18:53.089 --> 03:18:54.130
MATT: Currently.

03:18:54.130 --> 03:18:56.067
LAURA: And one little halfling that I've got a
rope on.

03:18:56.067 --> 03:19:00.686
MARISHA: Oh, one you've got a rope on? And is the
ship still like ahhh?

03:19:00.686 --> 03:19:01.914
MATT: Still listing, yeah.

03:19:01.914 --> 03:19:02.997
MARISHA: It's still a little crooked?

03:19:02.997 --> 03:19:06.107
MATT: Yeah, it's still on the side, and it's
slowly rotating as there's nobody at the helm.

03:19:06.107 --> 03:19:16.848
MARISHA: Okay. I, in my air form, I'm going to fly
over. I'll go through, and I'm going to use just

03:19:16.848 --> 03:19:24.060
my air form to lift underneath of the boat and try
and stabilize it.

03:19:24.060 --> 03:19:32.707
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and make an athletics check
using the air elemental's strength.

03:19:32.707 --> 03:19:39.642
MARISHA: Okay. Use my air dice. Eight.

03:19:39.642 --> 03:19:48.046
MATT: Using all the force of your elemental air,
you push and push, but this ship is extremely

03:19:48.046 --> 03:19:51.356
heavy, and this side of it, all the weight,
because the two other sides are given essentially

03:19:51.356 --> 03:19:55.958
an anti-gravity force from the arcane, all the
weight is being pushed into this one corner.

03:19:55.958 --> 03:20:00.412
Outside of a natural 20, you would not be able to
help this at all, unfortunately.

03:20:00.412 --> 03:20:02.471
MARISHA: Outside of a natural 20, wow.

03:20:02.471 --> 03:20:03.759
LIAM: But maybe!

03:20:03.759 --> 03:20:06.384
MATT: You never know, that could have been really
epic! That could've been really epic.

03:20:06.384 --> 03:20:07.735
MARISHA: Cool.

03:20:07.735 --> 03:20:10.635
SAM: Instead it was just okay.

03:20:10.635 --> 03:20:13.337
MARISHA: Well, I learn that the boat's heavy as
shit.

03:20:13.337 --> 03:20:14.601
MATT: Yeah you do.

03:20:14.601 --> 03:20:16.520
MARISHA: That's what I learned this turn.

03:20:16.520 --> 03:20:19.141
TALIESIN: In one of 20 dimensions, you're awesome
right now.

03:20:19.141 --> 03:20:20.043
MARISHA: Thanks.

03:20:20.043 --> 03:20:22.506
MATT: It's okay. You essentially one-shotted a
wyvern.

03:20:22.506 --> 03:20:24.016
LAURA and TRAVIS: Yeah.

03:20:24.016 --> 03:20:26.171
MATT: You bunny-one-shotted a wyvern.

03:20:26.171 --> 03:20:28.998
MARISHA: Oh, it's okay, I don't need, you know,
comfort.

03:20:28.998 --> 03:20:30.120
TRAVIS: Validation?

03:20:30.120 --> 03:20:31.097
MATT: I know.

03:20:31.097 --> 03:20:33.601
MARISHA: Don't need validation. Save it for
Orion.

03:20:33.601 --> 03:20:37.824
MATT: No, I just wanted to bring it up again. I
just wanted to bring it up again, because I think

03:20:37.824 --> 03:20:39.537
it's the most ridiculous death to a wyvern ever.

03:20:39.537 --> 03:20:41.189
ASHLEY: Death by bunny.

03:20:41.189 --> 03:20:50.578
MATT: Okay. This wyvern, looking at the
circumstance, takes off. Tries to fly and can't.

03:20:50.578 --> 03:20:52.384
TRAVIS: Oh, it can't fly?

03:20:52.384 --> 03:20:58.983
MATT: No, because its wing is messed up from
Tiberius, so it steps around to the only thing it

03:20:58.983 --> 03:21:00.657
can reach, which is you, Scanlan.

03:21:00.657 --> 03:21:01.940
SAM: That's fine.

03:21:01.940 --> 03:21:05.446
MATT: Coming at you with a bite and its stinger
again, because it can't use its claws. That is a--

03:21:05.446 --> 03:21:09.943
SAM: And I sing my little Cutting Words song to--

03:21:09.943 --> 03:21:11.484
MATT: Okay, against which attack?

03:21:11.484 --> 03:21:12.278
SAM: I'm sorry?

03:21:12.278 --> 03:21:13.079
MATT: Against which attack?

03:21:13.079 --> 03:21:14.210
SAM: Oh, he has two attacks?

03:21:14.210 --> 03:21:15.346
MATT: He has a bite and a stinger.

03:21:15.346 --> 03:21:16.451
SAM: Against the stinger.

03:21:16.451 --> 03:21:18.735
MATT: The bite is a 22 to hit.

03:21:18.735 --> 03:21:19.714
SAM: Oh, he hits.

03:21:19.714 --> 03:21:25.743
MATT: All right. You take 14 points of piercing
damage.

03:21:25.743 --> 03:21:26.918
SAM: Okay.

03:21:26.918 --> 03:21:28.264
LIAM: Scanlan!

03:21:28.264 --> 03:21:33.734
MATT: Its entire mouth just opens up and clamps
down onto your shoulder and torso. As it's holding

03:21:33.734 --> 03:21:40.046
you in place, you try and pull back as its tail
whips towards you. Go ahead and make your roll.

03:21:40.046 --> 03:21:42.176
SAM: What do I roll?

03:21:42.176 --> 03:21:45.463
MATT: Roll a d10, and that's whatever the attack
is reduced by.

03:21:45.463 --> 03:21:47.635
ORION: That's an eight.

03:21:47.635 --> 03:21:48.711
MATT: d10.

03:21:48.711 --> 03:21:52.303
ORION: That's d10. Yes! That's ten!

03:21:52.303 --> 03:21:53.129
SAM: Zero?

03:21:53.129 --> 03:21:54.042
MATT: That's ten.

03:21:54.042 --> 03:21:55.317
SAM: Ten, okay. Ten.

03:21:55.317 --> 03:21:58.648
MATT: All right. So it rolled a 24 to hit.

03:21:58.648 --> 03:22:00.055
SAM: That goes down to 14.

03:22:00.055 --> 03:22:00.787
MATT: To 14.

03:22:00.787 --> 03:22:01.923
SAM: My armor class is 15.

03:22:01.923 --> 03:22:03.475
TRAVIS: Yeah, amazing!

03:22:03.475 --> 03:22:04.669
ORION: Your armor class is 17.

03:22:04.669 --> 03:22:06.555
SAM: I'm also wearing a necklace which makes it
17.

03:22:06.555 --> 03:22:07.525
MARISHA: Your armor class is 17.

03:22:07.525 --> 03:22:08.813
ORION: Your armor class is 17.

03:22:08.813 --> 03:22:09.863
MATT: Oh, snap.

03:22:09.863 --> 03:22:11.131
SAM: So I'm okay. From that.

03:22:11.131 --> 03:22:12.421
MARISHA: Did you write that down?

03:22:12.421 --> 03:22:15.606
SAM: Well I wrote the armor and then there was
apparently some necklace that I forgot about.

03:22:15.606 --> 03:22:20.585
ORION: Yeah, he's had a plus two and the armor,
plus three to his AC, which was 14, so that's 17.

03:22:20.585 --> 03:22:21.728
LAURA: Seriously?

03:22:21.728 --> 03:22:23.270
SAM: Amulet of Natural Armor, I didn't realize. I
can give it--

03:22:23.270 --> 03:22:24.536
MARISHA: I know, I don't feel bad about taking the
ring.

03:22:24.536 --> 03:22:31.148
MATT: Well, fair enough. So, as it's clamping down
on you, its tail whips in the air-- what words are

03:22:31.148 --> 03:22:32.545
you going to throw?

03:22:32.545 --> 03:22:40.442
SAM: (sings) And you miss me like the deserts
miss the rain.

03:22:40.442 --> 03:22:45.251
MATT: The wyvern, who is still clamped down on
your body, its one eye opens up and goes, you hear

03:22:45.251 --> 03:22:53.160
an audible (hruh?). And as its tail swings towards
you, it just hits the ground next to you, slamming

03:22:53.160 --> 03:22:58.062
into the wood. Entirely distracted by your sudden
lack of fear and display of beautiful musical

03:22:58.062 --> 03:23:03.225
voice. Misses you. That ends its turn. Percy,
you're up.

03:23:03.225 --> 03:23:08.563
TALIESIN: All right, I'm taking out the Pepperbox.
I'm going to turn towards it, and just unload.

03:23:08.563 --> 03:23:09.969
MATT: All right, go for it.

03:23:09.969 --> 03:23:11.597
ORION: Shoot that load, Percy.

03:23:11.597 --> 03:23:13.044
LIAM: Finish it.

03:23:13.044 --> 03:23:14.396
LAURA: Yes.

03:23:14.396 --> 03:23:16.231
MARISHA: Unleash that load.

03:23:16.231 --> 03:23:17.331
TALIESIN: Ten.

03:23:17.331 --> 03:23:18.426
ORION: Damn it, I wasn't--

03:23:18.426 --> 03:23:19.713
MATT: Ten? Total ten?

03:23:19.713 --> 03:23:20.583
TALIESIN: Total ten.

03:23:20.583 --> 03:23:21.573
MATT: Nope.

03:23:21.573 --> 03:23:23.962
LIAM: You're the closer, Percy.

03:23:23.962 --> 03:23:24.953
TALIESIN: 22.

03:23:24.953 --> 03:23:25.932
LAURA: Yeah.

03:23:25.932 --> 03:23:27.810
MATT: That hits. You only get two attacks,
though.

03:23:27.810 --> 03:23:28.976
TALIESIN: I'm using my bonus action.

03:23:28.976 --> 03:23:30.618
MATT: Oh, you mean you're using your action
surge?

03:23:30.618 --> 03:23:31.556
TALIESIN: Using my action surge.

03:23:31.556 --> 03:23:33.092
MATT: Okay. So you get four attacks.

03:23:33.092 --> 03:23:38.180
TALIESIN: That misses. And then 19.

03:23:38.180 --> 03:23:39.571
MATT: That's two hits.

03:23:39.571 --> 03:23:45.071
TALIESIN: Yeah, that's two hits. I was also using
my sharpshooter mode for that so that I can do

03:23:45.071 --> 03:23:50.508
some extra damage, and that's... Number one,
that's--

03:23:50.508 --> 03:23:52.293
LAURA: Kill all the things.

03:23:52.293 --> 03:23:55.354
TALIESIN: 20 points of damage plus one point of
ice damage.

03:23:55.354 --> 03:23:56.824
MATT: All righty.

03:23:56.824 --> 03:23:59.030
SAM: It's the ice damage that's going to do it.

03:23:59.030 --> 03:24:00.120
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:24:00.120 --> 03:24:01.886
TALIESIN: And the next one is--

03:24:01.886 --> 03:24:03.190
SAM: Ooh, cold.

03:24:03.190 --> 03:24:06.780
LAURA: Ooh, it's a little chilly.

03:24:06.780 --> 03:24:09.623
TALIESIN: 25 points of damage and one point of
fire damage.

03:24:09.623 --> 03:24:10.875
MATT: How do you want to do this?

03:24:10.875 --> 03:24:12.151
(cheering)

03:24:12.151 --> 03:24:13.194
TRAVIS: The closer!

03:24:13.194 --> 03:24:14.334
MARISHA: The closer.

03:24:14.334 --> 03:24:17.114
TALIESIN: Western-style, I'm just going to--

03:24:17.114 --> 03:24:19.121
TRAVIS: Yeah, fan the fucking hammer.

03:24:19.121 --> 03:24:21.617
TALIESIN: I'm going to fan the hammer, I'm going
to just tear that wing off.

03:24:21.617 --> 03:24:25.950
MATT: So with each successive blast, even the ones
that don't immediately impact, the first blast

03:24:25.950 --> 03:24:30.294
hits and explodes across its shoulder
joint, as you see the rest of the flesh that

03:24:30.294 --> 03:24:34.705
Tiberius had already weakened gets severed
entirely, the wing flung off the side of the ship

03:24:34.705 --> 03:24:39.157
and disappearing in the wind beneath. As it rears
back in pain, the second one hits its side, the

03:24:39.157 --> 03:24:44.052
third one strikes it on the other wing, and as it
rears back in pain, its mouth open to the sky in

03:24:44.052 --> 03:24:49.127
this screeching death-rattle, the final blast hits
it under the chin, leaving a gaping hole

03:24:49.127 --> 03:24:56.229
under its neck as it steps back and then tumbles
off the edge of the ship, vanishing below.

03:24:56.229 --> 03:24:57.714
TRAVIS: Attacked the wrong ship.

03:24:57.714 --> 03:25:01.063
MARISHA: Wait wait wait. Can I catch it as an air
elemental and bring it back up?

03:25:01.063 --> 03:25:09.802
MATT: You are under the ship currently, you see
the wyvern (whoosh) below. You dive for it. Go

03:25:10.022 --> 03:25:12.165
ahead and make an athletics check.

03:25:12.165 --> 03:25:16.130
TALIESIN: Oh look, everyone, we still have one to
interrogate. Isn't that nice?

03:25:16.199 --> 03:25:17.291
MARISHA: 12.

03:25:17.291 --> 03:25:21.442
MATT: You try to grab it, but your air form
doesn't have quite, and it just swoops through--

03:25:21.442 --> 03:25:23.078
MARISHA: Oh, I'm an air elemental, shit shit
shit.

03:25:23.078 --> 03:25:24.515
MATT: -- and disappears towards the ocean below.

03:25:24.515 --> 03:25:25.775
MARISHA: Forgot.

03:25:25.775 --> 03:25:34.515
MATT: As the captain gets up, the other halfling,
which you can see is dressed in ragged robes, and

03:25:34.515 --> 03:25:35.938
has cloth wrapped across its face.

03:25:35.938 --> 03:25:38.093
LAURA: I pull the arrow so it wraps up in the
rope.

03:25:38.093 --> 03:25:45.404
MATT: The guards are there with
their weapons drawn. You can-- currently there is

03:25:45.404 --> 03:25:48.952
still the spear that's jammed in the side that's
sparking, causing the whole ship to list.

03:25:48.952 --> 03:25:52.144
MARISHA: Can I try and get that out?

03:25:52.144 --> 03:25:58.118
MATT: Yeah, as you swing up you go ahead and
manage to, as your air elemental form, pull the

03:25:58.171 --> 03:26:03.073
strange thing off the edge of the ship, at which
point the blue stone comes back online

03:26:03.073 --> 03:26:04.228
and the ship rights itself.

03:26:04.228 --> 03:26:07.121
LAURA: I thought it was cracked or something.

03:26:07.121 --> 03:26:11.010
MATT: Now you know.

03:26:11.010 --> 03:26:13.968
LAURA: We need to check on that box. Now.

03:26:13.968 --> 03:26:17.194
SAM: Oh yeah, that other wyvern was gone for a
while.

03:26:17.424 --> 03:26:18.641
TALIESIN: I'll go check, you interrogate.

03:26:18.641 --> 03:26:21.450
TRAVIS: We haven't seen any of them come out of
that room.

03:26:21.450 --> 03:26:22.588
MATT: All right. So.

03:26:22.588 --> 03:26:24.004
TALIESIN: If they were clever, they didn't leave
the room.

03:26:24.004 --> 03:26:27.051
ASHLEY: If these are, like he said, a
distraction...

03:26:27.051 --> 03:26:28.662
TALIESIN: I'm going to run down and check the
box.

03:26:28.662 --> 03:26:33.823
MATT: This halfling is currently on the side right
now, the one guard holding it. Who's going

03:26:33.823 --> 03:26:34.713
downstairs?

03:26:34.713 --> 03:26:35.771
TALIESIN: I'm going downstairs.

03:26:35.771 --> 03:26:37.012
TRAVIS: And I'll go to the halfling.

03:26:37.012 --> 03:26:38.995
ASHLEY: Liam, where are you at?

03:26:38.995 --> 03:26:41.501
LAURA: He's in New Jersey.

03:26:41.501 --> 03:26:45.194
LIAM: Last time I spoke, I was by Keyleth. I'm
just following her lead.

03:26:45.194 --> 03:26:46.520
ASHLEY: Are you okay health-wise?

03:26:46.520 --> 03:26:51.845
LIAM: I'm all right. Been better, I've been
worse.

03:26:51.845 --> 03:26:53.769
MATT: So you went over to the halfling. What do
you want to do?

03:26:53.769 --> 03:26:57.821
TRAVIS: I would like to pick him up, not chuck
him, but pick him up and hold him ever-so-gently

03:26:57.821 --> 03:27:03.833
over the side and say, My, my, it does seem like a
long way down. What the fuck are you doing

03:27:03.833 --> 03:27:05.381
attacking this ship?

03:27:05.381 --> 03:27:07.460
ORION: As he says that, I hover the daggers.

03:27:07.460 --> 03:27:12.640
MATT: All right. Roll an intimidation check with
advantage because of Tiberius's--

03:27:12.640 --> 03:27:15.124
SAM: Don't worry, if you fail I can intimidate
him.

03:27:15.124 --> 03:27:17.414
LAURA: Do you have a beard today? He definitely
has a beard today.

03:27:17.414 --> 03:27:18.558
TRAVIS: 16.

03:27:18.558 --> 03:27:19.829
MATT: On both rolls?

03:27:19.829 --> 03:27:21.216
TRAVIS: 16 on the advantage roll.

03:27:21.216 --> 03:27:28.932
MATT: Oh, got you, okay. All right, so the
halfling, which you now look, appears to be

03:27:28.932 --> 03:27:36.078
female. The cloth drops from its face. You can see
the teeth are broken and rotted. This is not a

03:27:36.078 --> 03:27:47.392
city-going folk. "Please, please don't, just let
me live. Let me live."

03:27:47.445 --> 03:27:48.663
TRAVIS: Let you live? Oh!

03:27:48.663 --> 03:27:51.045
MATT: "Guh! Stop it, stop it!"

03:27:51.045 --> 03:27:52.384
TRAVIS: It was such a hard battle, I'm shaking.

03:27:52.384 --> 03:27:53.938
MATT: Starts crying in your grasp.

03:27:53.938 --> 03:27:59.712
ORION: If you wish to live, answer our giant
friend who asked you a rather polite question.

03:27:59.712 --> 03:28:02.467
MATT: "What was the question again?"

03:28:02.467 --> 03:28:07.221
TRAVIS: You know, my hands are so sweaty, I'm
afraid you'll slip if you don't tell me what you

03:28:07.221 --> 03:28:09.825
were doing attacking this ship.

03:28:09.825 --> 03:28:21.975
MATT: "We live in an island below. We usually just
hit ships that come through this channel, this

03:28:21.975 --> 03:28:27.648
"pass. Pirating, if you will. Take money, things
that we can, and run. Usually it's just quick hits

03:28:27.648 --> 03:28:34.193
"and go. We couldn't pass up the opportunity. We
managed to acquire a few things to help, and we've

03:28:34.193 --> 03:28:39.629
"only harried one other skyship. Once we saw you,
we knew there had to be some sort of riches

03:28:39.629 --> 03:28:41.590
"involved."

03:28:41.663 --> 03:28:47.800
LAURA: Insight check?

03:28:48.020 --> 03:28:51.529
LIAM: 16.

03:28:51.700 --> 03:28:53.343
LAURA: 20.

03:28:53.343 --> 03:28:59.613
MATT: Extremely scared, extremely honest, in a
mode of trying to stay alive at this point in time.

03:28:59.613 --> 03:29:01.476
ASHLEY: So nobody hired you?

03:29:01.476 --> 03:29:08.237
MATT: "No, no, haven't been to a city in years. I
told you, we have an island below, it's a cavern

03:29:08.237 --> 03:29:13.669
"we live in. We just come up and out to grab what
we can to survive."

03:29:13.669 --> 03:29:18.162
LAURA: Captain Damon, what do you propose we do
with this thief-pirate?

03:29:18.212 --> 03:29:21.175
MATT: Captain Damon, who's gone back to the ship
to try and get it back on course, is currently

03:29:21.175 --> 03:29:27.646
turning it around. "To be perfectly honest, I
usually throw them overboard. But if you see--"

03:29:27.646 --> 03:29:28.722
TRAVIS: Drop!

03:29:28.722 --> 03:29:30.728
MATT: (screams)

03:29:30.728 --> 03:29:34.446
TRAVIS: If you want him, you can catch him. Her.

03:29:34.446 --> 03:29:35.625
LAURA: Grog!

03:29:35.625 --> 03:29:37.637
TRAVIS: What? The captain said he'd throw him
over.

03:29:37.637 --> 03:29:38.933
SAM: Her.

03:29:38.933 --> 03:29:40.321
TRAVIS: Her over.

03:29:40.321 --> 03:29:42.875
LAURA: It was a girl, it was a poor little girl
halfling.

03:29:42.875 --> 03:29:44.473
Oh wait, I still have the grapple arrow.

03:29:44.524 --> 03:29:46.339
MATT: You do. As the rope's going (unraveling
rope)--

03:29:46.339 --> 03:29:49.498
LAURA: No, I'm still holding on still, so she's
dangling? Can I catch her?

03:29:49.498 --> 03:29:51.856
MATT: Currently, yes. As you look over-- actually,
let me--

03:29:51.856 --> 03:29:53.883
SAM: Does she have an arrow through her arm?

03:29:53.883 --> 03:29:54.736
LAURA: Yeah.

03:29:54.736 --> 03:30:00.770
MATT: Yes. In a very painful way she is currently
held by her shoulder blade, which now has--

03:30:00.770 --> 03:30:03.856
LAURA: But it was wrapped around her, so maybe it
didn't hurt quite as bad.

03:30:03.856 --> 03:30:05.743
MATT: It hurt pretty bad.

03:30:05.743 --> 03:30:10.435
LAURA: I pull her up. I look at Grog. Really?

03:30:10.435 --> 03:30:11.947
TRAVIS: What he's thinking, I'm doing.

03:30:11.947 --> 03:30:14.160
LAURA: Really? I pull her up.

03:30:14.160 --> 03:30:16.778
MATT: You pull her up. She's bleeding out and is
looking pretty rough.

03:30:16.778 --> 03:30:18.587
LAURA: Oh shit, maybe we should've let her drop.

03:30:18.587 --> 03:30:22.223
TRAVIS: Oh, really? I pick her up--

03:30:22.223 --> 03:30:23.516
LAURA: No, no. No.

03:30:23.516 --> 03:30:24.689
TRAVIS: Put her back down.

03:30:24.689 --> 03:30:26.626
LAURA: What, should we put her in a prison cell? I
don't know what to do with her now that we have her.

03:30:26.626 --> 03:30:29.961
LIAM: Heal her and put her to work. She's probably
been out of work.

03:30:29.961 --> 03:30:32.457
LAURA: What do you think, little one? You want a
real job, maybe brush your teeth?

03:30:32.457 --> 03:30:34.582
SAM: She can replace the guard that they killed.

03:30:34.582 --> 03:30:38.515
MATT: She's on one knee, going, "Anything."

03:30:38.515 --> 03:30:39.584
LAURA: Anything.

03:30:39.584 --> 03:30:43.781
MATT: "Anything. Just don't drop me." Looking over
at Grog again. "Don't drop me."

03:30:43.781 --> 03:30:45.052
LAURA: Be afraid of him.

03:30:45.052 --> 03:30:46.171
MATT: "Don't drop me."

03:30:46.171 --> 03:30:49.915
LAURA: Be very afraid. Pike, do you want to heal
her?

03:30:49.915 --> 03:30:51.722
ASHLEY: Well. Come here.

03:30:51.722 --> 03:30:55.015
ORION: Are we in agreement, we are saving this
one?

03:30:55.015 --> 03:30:56.507
MARISHA: I guess so.

03:30:56.507 --> 03:31:00.655
SAM: I'm going to go through her pockets, make
sure she's not hiding any weapons to attack us.

03:31:00.655 --> 03:31:04.443
MARISHA: To be fair, we did lose one over the
edge, so we might need another crew member.

03:31:04.443 --> 03:31:05.381
LAURA: That's true.

03:31:05.381 --> 03:31:07.620
ASHLEY: Well, what's your name?

03:31:07.620 --> 03:31:08.728
MATT: "Teera."

03:31:08.728 --> 03:31:09.794
LAURA: Teera.

03:31:09.794 --> 03:31:12.353
ASHLEY: Teera. How old are you?

03:31:12.424 --> 03:31:13.672
MATT: "I don't know."

03:31:13.672 --> 03:31:15.386
LAURA AND SAM: Oh, that's so sad.

03:31:15.386 --> 03:31:20.462
MATT: She looks in her maybe twenties or thirties?
Up close you can see, just a harsh life in the

03:31:20.644 --> 03:31:24.561
harsh elements. She looks older than she is, but
there's a youthfulness to her.

03:31:24.561 --> 03:31:28.965
LAURA: Her breath is really really bad, maybe you
can heal her teeth while you're at it.

03:31:28.965 --> 03:31:33.835
SAM: Teera, empty your pockets. I give her a quick
pat-down to make sure she's not carrying any

03:31:33.835 --> 03:31:35.516
daggers or anything.

03:31:35.516 --> 03:31:41.162
MATT: There are a few rusty hidden blades and a
coin purse that contains four gold.

03:31:41.162 --> 03:31:42.324
SAM: Sweet.

03:31:42.324 --> 03:31:44.816
ASHLEY: Four gold.

03:31:44.816 --> 03:31:46.157
SAM: I take it.

03:31:46.157 --> 03:31:47.037
MATT: All right.

03:31:47.037 --> 03:31:48.835
LAURA: You can earn your wage on this ship, if you
behave.

03:31:48.835 --> 03:31:52.240
MATT: "All right. All right."

03:31:52.240 --> 03:31:59.280
TRAVIS: If you don't. (falling sound)

03:31:59.280 --> 03:32:02.234
SAM: He means he'll throw you overboard.

03:32:02.234 --> 03:32:06.097
LIAM: You can have a real life here, little one.

03:32:06.097 --> 03:32:07.343
LAURA: Yeah.

03:32:07.343 --> 03:32:09.282
LIAM: That's your past. This is your future.

03:32:09.282 --> 03:32:13.843
MATT: And she slinks over towards the doorways
that lead into the lower part of the deck. As you

03:32:13.843 --> 03:32:23.136
guys lead Teera in, the captain has regained
control of the ship, and you guys head in to check

03:32:23.136 --> 03:32:25.653
in on the room where the--

03:32:25.653 --> 03:32:29.358
TALIESIN: I'm knocking on the door. "All right?
Desona?"

03:32:29.358 --> 03:32:31.307
LAURA: Lady Kima?

03:32:31.307 --> 03:32:33.064
TALIESIN: Lady Kima? Hello?

03:32:33.064 --> 03:32:37.258
MATT: The door opens and they're still sitting in
the back by the box with their weapons at the

03:32:37.258 --> 03:32:39.824
ready and Kima looks at the door. "Is everything
all right?"

03:32:39.824 --> 03:32:41.644
TALIESIN: Yes, pirates. We've taken care of it.

03:32:41.644 --> 03:32:46.017
MATT: "Good." And she's rubbing her head. You can
see there's a little trickle of blood on her head,

03:32:46.017 --> 03:32:50.195
apparently when the ship listed, they all slipped
in the room as well.

03:32:50.195 --> 03:32:51.607
TRAVIS: Is she hurt?

03:32:51.607 --> 03:32:53.414
TALIESIN: Do you need anything, is everything all
right?

03:32:53.414 --> 03:32:56.278
MATT: "Ah, it's fine." She reaches up and touches
her head, you can see there's a slight warm glow

03:32:56.278 --> 03:32:59.072
of divine energy and the blood flow stops.

03:32:59.072 --> 03:33:05.552
TALIESIN: Almost feels like cheating. Okay. As
long as everything is fine, there was no

03:33:05.552 --> 03:33:07.489
incidents, nothing unusual?

03:33:07.489 --> 03:33:09.363
MATT: "Nothing, nothing, I've kept a very close
watch."

03:33:09.363 --> 03:33:12.010
TALIESIN: Excellent. I'll report upstairs, then.

03:33:12.010 --> 03:33:13.032
MATT: "Very well."

03:33:13.032 --> 03:33:14.405
TALIESIN: Carry on.

03:33:14.405 --> 03:33:17.661
ASHLEY: Really, the box is fine? For sure?

03:33:17.661 --> 03:33:21.160
TALIESIN: Everybody seemed fine, they said no
events, nothing--

03:33:21.160 --> 03:33:24.347
LAURA: This fricking gnat in this fricking room.

03:33:24.347 --> 03:33:26.956
MARISHA: I know, it was trolling over here.

03:33:26.956 --> 03:33:30.124
ASHLEY: Should we do insight? I don't know.

03:33:30.124 --> 03:33:31.993
TALIESIN: Guards in a room, I mean really.

03:33:31.993 --> 03:33:33.804
ASHLEY: I know, all right, all right.

03:33:33.804 --> 03:33:35.490
TALIESIN: My insight was the box was still there.

03:33:35.490 --> 03:33:39.892
ORION: I cast Prestidigitation on the little
halfling and clean her up real quick.

03:33:39.892 --> 03:33:45.005
MATT: Okay. As she's going
inside, she watches her form--

03:33:45.005 --> 03:33:47.697
LAURA: It feels like little fishes, doesn't it?

03:33:47.697 --> 03:33:51.099
MATT: She sounds tickled and scared at the same
time. But the clothing cleans up. It's still

03:33:51.099 --> 03:33:58.861
tattered, and she looks a little cleaner. Most of
the dirt's gone, but she still looks weathered,

03:33:58.861 --> 03:34:00.819
her skin's darker from a lot of sun.

03:34:00.819 --> 03:34:02.442
ORION: I was mainly working on the smell.

03:34:02.442 --> 03:34:06.807
MATT: Ah. That's taken care of. She looks to you.
"Thanks."

03:34:06.807 --> 03:34:09.056
ORION: A proper bath will be better, but--

03:34:09.056 --> 03:34:10.432
LAURA: Is she healed? Did you heal her?

03:34:10.432 --> 03:34:11.716
ASHLEY: Yeah. Yeah, I did.

03:34:11.716 --> 03:34:13.705
MARISHA: I drop the elemental form.

03:34:13.705 --> 03:34:14.869
MATT: All right.

03:34:14.869 --> 03:34:18.100
MARISHA: No longer a tornado.

03:34:18.100 --> 03:34:24.231
MATT: We'll say as you guys all head back
underneath the ship to go ahead and right

03:34:24.231 --> 03:34:29.549
yourselves for the remainder of the journey, we'll
call the game for the evening there.

03:34:29.549 --> 03:34:30.906
TRAVIS: Yeah!

03:34:30.906 --> 03:34:32.109
LAURA: Wow.

03:34:32.109 --> 03:34:34.944
TALIESIN: Welcome back, everybody.

03:34:34.944 --> 03:34:36.940
TRAVIS: Great map, man.

03:34:36.940 --> 03:34:38.635
LAURA: That's so cool!

03:34:38.635 --> 03:34:39.804
TRAVIS: That shit looks awesome.

03:34:39.804 --> 03:34:41.114
MARISHA: I know, it's so cool!

03:34:41.114 --> 03:34:43.125
MATT: You guys handled that pretty damn well.

03:34:43.125 --> 03:34:44.818
TALIESIN: This is way better than E3.

03:34:44.818 --> 03:34:46.387
LAURA: He's definitely trying to kill us.

03:34:46.387 --> 03:34:49.132
TRAVIS: Only one of us got thrown off the ship,
and she could fly.

03:34:49.132 --> 03:34:51.445
MARISHA: I know! It was nice.

03:34:51.445 --> 03:34:54.982
MATT: Yeah, they had no idea you were a druid. You
were the closest one to the griffons.

03:34:54.982 --> 03:34:56.980
MARISHA: I'm okay, I'm okay.

03:34:56.980 --> 03:35:00.808
TRAVIS: Normally that's me, just right off.

03:35:00.933 --> 03:35:05.388
TALIESIN: We never liked her anyway, whatever.

03:35:05.465 --> 04:09:01.942
[end of game]
