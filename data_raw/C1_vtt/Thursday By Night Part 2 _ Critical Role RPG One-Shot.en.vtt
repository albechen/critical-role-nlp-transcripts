00:00:00.097 --> 00:00:04.800
TALIESIN: Didn't work last week, why was it going
to work this week? Good evening everybody, and

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:21.027
welcome to the second part of our Vampire-palooza
here on Critical Role. (laughter) Yes. While Matt

00:00:21.027 --> 00:00:25.881
and Marisha are off on vacation somewhere warm and
bright, we will be slinking through the darkness

00:00:25.881 --> 00:00:31.678
of Los Angeles. Currently, gosh, everybody looks
so pretty. Actually, it's really hot in here, so

00:00:31.678 --> 00:00:33.253
I'm going to--

00:00:33.253 --> 00:00:35.702
LAURA: We already know where you are. The hood is
pointless.

00:00:35.702 --> 00:00:37.736
LIAM: Taliesin, when did you get here?!

00:00:37.736 --> 00:00:40.598
LAURA: We're all going to have lisps tonight, you
guys.

00:00:40.598 --> 00:00:43.390
LIAM: I am going to see how long I can last with
these fuckers in.

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:44.788
LAURA: Because you have really big fangs.

00:00:44.788 --> 00:00:46.575
TRAVIS: You've already fallen apart.

00:00:46.575 --> 00:00:51.134
LIAM: Yeah, I know. If I can talk with a southern
accent, I'm fine. But other than that, I ain't

00:00:51.134 --> 00:00:56.039
good. So I'll give you about ten minutes before
these suckers come out.

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:05.263
TALIESIN: I heard vampires burn. Get the diesel.
Yeah, everybody looks spectacular. That's a great

00:01:05.263 --> 00:01:07.288
cake, by the way. We'll see how long that lasts.

00:01:07.288 --> 00:01:09.519
SAM: You're from Portal?

00:01:09.519 --> 00:01:11.518
LAURA: Yeah, I'm from Portal! I'm Chell.

00:01:11.518 --> 00:01:16.611
SAM: And you're Assassin's Creed? Okay, I guessed
on that one.

00:01:16.611 --> 00:01:18.058
TRAVIS: And Liam is?

00:01:18.058 --> 00:01:20.610
LIAM: Hold on, let me check my Pip Boy. Yep.

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.447
LAURA: It really is a Pip Boy! It's so cool!

00:01:22.447 --> 00:01:27.139
TRAVIS: Sam, what is Liam from?

00:01:27.139 --> 00:01:28.894
SAM: He's from Fallout, he told me.

00:01:28.894 --> 00:01:30.205
TALIESIN: I'm so impressed so far.

00:01:30.205 --> 00:01:31.940
LAURA: And what is Travis from?

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:34.679
SAM: That's the only one I know. He is Ellie from
The Last of Us.

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:36.066
TRAVIS: That's right. Yep.

00:01:36.066 --> 00:01:38.423
LIAM: That's the worst Q-Bert cosplay I've ever
seen.

00:01:38.423 --> 00:01:40.408
LAURA: You're Kirby?

00:01:40.408 --> 00:01:41.821
SAM: I'm Pac-Man.

00:01:41.821 --> 00:01:42.811
LAURA: Oh.

00:01:42.811 --> 00:01:44.210
TRAVIS: Are you?

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:51.750
SAM: This is apparently Pac-Man. This was $14 on
Amazon and it does not look like Pac-Man to me. It

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.947
looks like an M&amp;M.

00:01:53.947 --> 00:02:01.554
TALIESIN: It looks like a peanut M&amp;M that's really
pretending it didn't have a bad day.

00:02:01.554 --> 00:02:05.182
TRAVIS: Little Shop of Horrors meets peanut M&amp;Ms.

00:02:05.182 --> 00:02:09.677
LIAM: I've had bad dreams about this.

00:02:09.677 --> 00:02:15.508
TALIESIN: It's really intense. I feel like, yeah,
between the two of us, with the $15 costume

00:02:15.508 --> 00:02:27.125
contest. I'm always a fan of a cheap trip to Hot
Topic, so. We have a sponsor tonight! We are being

00:02:27.184 --> 00:02:33.436
brought to you by Tor Books. Does Pac-Man have
anything to--?

00:02:33.436 --> 00:02:38.151
SAM: Tor Books! Today's episode is brought to you
by our friends at Tor Books, America's largest

00:02:38.151 --> 00:02:43.739
publisher of science fiction and fantasy. On
November 14th, Tor Books is proud to release

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:52.045
Oathbringer, by Brandon Sanderson. The third book
in the #1 best-selling Stormlight Archive follows

00:02:52.045 --> 00:02:57.341
The Way of the Wings and Words of Radiance. To
gear up for your return to Roshar, which

00:02:57.341 --> 00:03:01.998
apparently is something from the book, Tor Books
is celebrating by offering fans a chance to win an

00:03:01.998 --> 00:03:11.116
exclusive, one-of-a-kind Bag of Holding. This 100%
leather messenger bag was handcrafted by Beastman

00:03:11.116 --> 00:03:16.548
Caravan and contains a copy of Oathbringer to help
you on your quest. For a chance to win and for

00:03:16.548 --> 00:03:21.208
official rules, visit the link that will be on
your screen, and follow Tor on Twitter at

00:03:21.208 --> 00:03:29.634
@torbooks to tell them what's in your Bag of
Holding using the hashtag #torbagofholding.

00:03:29.634 --> 00:03:36.392
Because they're watching, guys, real quick,
they're a huge sci-fi publisher. This is my chance

00:03:36.392 --> 00:03:37.879
to pitch my book.

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:39.961
TRAVIS: That's really smart!

00:03:39.961 --> 00:03:44.187
SAM: I've been pitching it around town, not really
getting traction, but they're watching. Captive

00:03:44.187 --> 00:03:45.110
audience.

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:46.618
LIAM: And you are dressed for success.

00:03:46.618 --> 00:03:56.259
SAM: So bear with me. Here's my pitch. Elevator
pitch. The year is 9999 and techno-cyber detective

00:03:56.259 --> 00:04:02.585
Icarus Dunk is tracking the infamous Extonium
bandit, Wrath McQuaid through the radiation mines

00:04:02.585 --> 00:04:08.406
of Sector Nine. Armed with his trademark time
cannon, Icarus came ready for danger, but didn't

00:04:08.406 --> 00:04:15.299
bargain for love. At a hex-fuel outpost in the
desert world of Crypto-Diphthong Nine, Icarus'

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:20.747
ship, the STS Peacock, docks with a mysterious
vessel piloted by the most beautiful Gorgon he's

00:04:20.747 --> 00:04:29.251
ever laid his eyes on: the leggy, legendary
ecto-crystal smuggler named Crasnogorofst Nine.

00:04:29.251 --> 00:04:37.196
All of her faces are as gorgeous as her name. With
Icarus and Crasnogorofst Nine together, will the

00:04:37.196 --> 00:04:43.587
universe ever be the same? Think of it like
Ender's Game meets Dune, but with Asimov dialog

00:04:43.587 --> 00:04:49.896
and Heinlein twists, and a little dash of, I don't
know, The Name of the Wind or something.

00:04:49.896 --> 00:04:52.330
TRAVIS: I'm pretty sure there was some Rick and
Morty in there too.

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:58.746
SAM: It's available. It doesn't currently have a
publisher yet. Also, I haven't written it yet. I'm

00:04:58.746 --> 00:05:00.185
trying to sell it on the pitch.

00:05:00.185 --> 00:05:01.356
LAURA: Yeah, good call.

00:05:01.356 --> 00:05:04.125
SAM: Thank you, Tor Books! Please buy my book.

00:05:04.125 --> 00:05:05.918
TRAVIS: Laura will be stealing this book.

00:05:05.918 --> 00:05:07.324
LAURA: Yes I will!

00:05:07.324 --> 00:05:13.862
TALIESIN: On that note of stealing books, I don't
know, that was my best segue. It's the segue I

00:05:13.862 --> 00:05:17.568
have. We go with the segues we have. Merchandise.

00:05:17.568 --> 00:05:19.998
LAURA: How is that at all having to do with--

00:05:19.998 --> 00:05:23.353
TALIESIN: I didn't say it was a good segue, I said
it was the segue we have.

00:05:23.353 --> 00:05:29.852
LAURA: Okay, I'm really-- it's hard to tell if
these cameras are on us, but I think that they are.

00:05:29.852 --> 00:05:31.868
TALIESIN: This new setup is very strange.

00:05:31.868 --> 00:05:36.647
LAURA: I have two things to tell you about
tonight. This is good for the holidays.

00:05:36.647 --> 00:05:42.194
LIAM: I am so excited.

00:05:42.194 --> 00:05:53.671
LAURA: These are Strongjaw Ale coasters! For your
personal Strongjaw bar at home! Look at these

00:05:53.671 --> 00:05:56.023
fucking-- and they're like, rubbery. They're cool
as fuck.

00:05:56.023 --> 00:05:59.342
TALIESIN: The back of them is pretty cool, too.

00:05:59.342 --> 00:06:04.074
SAM: Aged six months in a Bag of Holding.

00:06:04.074 --> 00:06:10.577
LAURA: Like our shirts, man! With our Critical
Role logo! It's pretty tight!

00:06:10.577 --> 00:06:12.440
TRAVIS: And it's, like, super textured.

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:18.570
LAURA: In addition to those wonderful stocking
stuffers, I have, okay, so these have been in the

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:30.100
works for a very freaking long time. Finally, we
can announce them! With teeth in our mouth. Okay,

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:38.588
okay! So, it's a set of d20s, but they're all
inspired by our characters. We designed all of our

00:06:38.588 --> 00:06:44.446
dice ourselves. And it comes in this Vox Machina
logo bag, but it looks like it's from Gilmore's

00:06:44.446 --> 00:06:46.287
Glorious Goods!

00:06:46.287 --> 00:06:50.401
LIAM: We picked the texture and the color and the
design for the d20!

00:06:50.401 --> 00:06:53.093
LAURA: I have never sounded nerdier in my entire
life, and I love it.

00:06:53.093 --> 00:06:55.067
TRAVIS: All the d20s are something different.

00:06:55.067 --> 00:06:56.967
LAURA: Sam, yours is a total troll dice.

00:06:56.967 --> 00:07:00.860
SAM: Is this mine? I can't read it.

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:02.913
LAURA: You specifically asked for--

00:07:02.913 --> 00:07:05.297
SAM: This was a long time ago.

00:07:05.297 --> 00:07:07.648
LAURA: Yeah. You were like, "I want people to not
be able to read it."

00:07:07.648 --> 00:07:09.167
SAM: Yeah, I'm a dick.

00:07:09.167 --> 00:07:14.284
LAURA: So his is sparkly with purple on pink. It's
really hard to read.

00:07:14.284 --> 00:07:16.156
TRAVIS: Keyleth's has antlers.

00:07:16.156 --> 00:07:20.219
LAURA: Mine is really beautiful because it's
inspired by my white dragon armor.

00:07:20.219 --> 00:07:22.198
TRAVIS: Mine has a big ale of mug on the 20.

00:07:22.198 --> 00:07:25.361
LAURA: Yeah, and the 20s have our little icon on
the 20!

00:07:25.361 --> 00:07:28.055
TALIESIN: This is the Sarenrae logo.

00:07:28.055 --> 00:07:32.815
TRAVIS: Oh, yours is dope, with the two arrows and
the bear paw! It looks all marble-ized!

00:07:32.815 --> 00:07:36.136
LAURA: And he's got the de Rolo family crest.

00:07:36.136 --> 00:07:39.234
LIAM: I have a dagger and a feather crossed into
an X.

00:07:39.234 --> 00:07:41.769
TRAVIS: What nerd got a book on theirs as the 20?

00:07:41.769 --> 00:07:43.289
LAURA: I know, what a loser.

00:07:43.289 --> 00:07:47.165
LIAM: Who likes books? Except books from Tor
Books!

00:07:47.165 --> 00:07:49.106
LAURA: There's the segue!

00:07:49.106 --> 00:07:54.409
TRAVIS: Get your d20! And it's soft, as with all
of our things.

00:07:54.409 --> 00:07:58.689
LAURA: Online, right now! They're in the store
right now!

00:07:58.689 --> 00:08:01.576
TALIESIN: Oh my god, I can't believe it finally
happened.

00:08:01.576 --> 00:08:03.177
LAURA: I know, in the store! Right now!

00:08:03.177 --> 00:08:05.310
TALIESIN: We have been working on this for quite a
while.

00:08:05.310 --> 00:08:09.652
LAURA: Yeah, this is coming out this week, and
then we've got more merch coming out for the

00:08:09.652 --> 00:08:16.119
holidays. So you know, keep your eye on the shop.
You don't have to, I'll be announcing it. You

00:08:16.119 --> 00:08:20.131
don't have to. Yeah, I have enough for all of us
to take.

00:08:20.131 --> 00:08:23.403
LIAM: Taliesin, may I use the V.A.T.S. system this
evening?

00:08:23.403 --> 00:08:27.238
TALIESIN: I'll allow it.

00:08:27.238 --> 00:08:32.999
TRAVIS: Where did that come from? Oh shit!

00:08:32.999 --> 00:08:38.508
LAURA: You are so fancy! I don't even have a
Portal gun, and he's got two guns!

00:08:38.508 --> 00:08:45.731
LIAM: This was a Nerf gun that I got on Etsy,
painted by some charming fellow or a lass.

00:08:45.731 --> 00:08:48.306
TALIESIN: This whole game is going to feel so
horribly wrong with that accent.

00:08:48.306 --> 00:08:53.612
LIAM: Oh, the teeth are coming out. I cannot do
the whole night with the teeth, no way.

00:08:53.612 --> 00:08:59.042
TALIESIN: I'm not going to fight it. The Critical
Role podcast is up on iTunes, Google, and

00:08:59.042 --> 00:09:03.785
geekandsundry.com. We're up to apparently episode
55. I know! That's a lot!

00:09:03.785 --> 00:09:05.367
LIAM: We've done that many episodes?

00:09:05.367 --> 00:09:10.501
TALIESIN: We've done over a hundred now. It
doesn't feel like that, does it? It doesn't make

00:09:10.501 --> 00:09:16.444
any sense. I know, slouching toward the end.

00:09:16.444 --> 00:09:18.042
LIAM: Thanks, Pac-Murderer.

00:09:18.042 --> 00:09:25.005
TALIESIN: Goddamn it. It's also available on
Amazon Alexa, which I haven't quite figured out

00:09:25.005 --> 00:09:27.628
what that means yet, but I'm fascinated by the
notion of this.

00:09:27.628 --> 00:09:30.100
SAM: Wait, so I can say-- We've talked about this
before.

00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:32.229
TALIESIN: We've talked about this. We did a whole
gag.

00:09:32.229 --> 00:09:35.518
SAM: I could say, "Alexa, play Critical Role." I'm
going to do it tonight.

00:09:35.518 --> 00:09:36.929
LAURA: What? Really? It might work?

00:09:36.929 --> 00:09:41.550
TALIESIN: "Open Critical Role." If you have one,
you can simply ask Alexa to "open Critical Role.

00:09:41.550 --> 00:09:51.446
"Alexa, open Critical Role." I don't have one. A
lot of people are really angry at me now. I hope

00:09:51.446 --> 00:09:57.685
so. Second issue of the comic book has come out.
It's amazing and it's fabulous, and you two are

00:09:57.685 --> 00:10:07.481
adorable. It's great. Let's see, what else have we
got here? You and Marisha did a thing that got

00:10:07.481 --> 00:10:08.827
released today.

00:10:08.827 --> 00:10:16.013
LIAM: Oh my god, yeah! Sagas of Sundry: Madness!
Came out.

00:10:16.013 --> 00:10:20.563
TRAVIS: The tongue lick after each sibilant is the
best.

00:10:20.563 --> 00:10:28.131
LIAM: There's too much extra shit with them! Too
much wax. I'll try again another year. Yeah, Sagas

00:10:28.131 --> 00:10:34.493
of Sundry: Madness. Ivan led us on a fucking wild
ride and scared the shit out of me a little bit,

00:10:34.493 --> 00:10:35.535
initially.

00:10:35.535 --> 00:10:39.903
TALIESIN: I haven't seen the prequel yet, but I
saw some footage and it looked pretty intense.

00:10:39.903 --> 00:10:44.717
LIAM: Came together real good. Real good. Should
definitely try it. It's on Project Alpha now.

00:10:44.717 --> 00:10:48.355
TALIESIN: Yeah, there's a little trailer on
YouTube that went up today if you want to get a

00:10:48.355 --> 00:10:55.709
glimpse. If you want to get an idea of what the
thing looks like, the preview episode of the first

00:10:55.709 --> 00:11:01.408
season is available on Twitch. You can find that
and see if you like the idea of people using a

00:11:01.408 --> 00:11:03.893
giant wooden tower to play a game. It's pretty
cool.

00:11:03.893 --> 00:11:06.871
LIAM: Oh, it was nerve-wracking! And it's
Halloween, so it's timely.

00:11:06.871 --> 00:11:10.828
LAURA: It's hot in here, so my cake is melting.

00:11:10.828 --> 00:11:11.893
SAM: Can we eat it?

00:11:11.893 --> 00:11:13.699
LAURA: Yeah, we can totally eat it at the break!

00:11:13.699 --> 00:11:18.972
TALIESIN: Next week, I'm not running another
Vampire game because this is stressful and I need

00:11:18.972 --> 00:11:24.497
to take a vacation. Let's be honest, it's because
this is stressful and I need to take a vacation.

00:11:24.497 --> 00:11:29.166
Boy, am I really looking forward to being on the
other side of this piece of wood.

00:11:29.166 --> 00:11:31.019
LIAM: Why do you think the Mercers went around the
planet?

00:11:31.019 --> 00:11:33.761
TALIESIN: Man, I would escape to another continent
myself.

00:11:33.761 --> 00:11:36.043
SAM: I think you mean the Rays.

00:11:36.043 --> 00:11:38.392
LIAM: They're kicking it in Australia right now,
having a blast.

00:11:38.392 --> 00:11:42.227
TRAVIS: New one of these next week.

00:11:42.227 --> 00:11:46.577
SAM: Yeah, what are we doing next week? Are we
announcing that? One-shot?

00:11:46.577 --> 00:11:48.539
TALIESIN: I choose you, Pikachu.

00:11:48.539 --> 00:11:50.485
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'm doing a one-shot.

00:11:50.485 --> 00:11:52.362
SAM: Travis Willingham one-shot.

00:11:52.362 --> 00:11:56.216
TRAVIS: Or rather, Grog is running a one-shot.

00:11:56.216 --> 00:11:58.781
SAM: That is a high-concept piece.

00:11:58.781 --> 00:12:06.167
TRAVIS: Grog's game-night comes next week, where
we will all play Bunions and Flagons.

00:12:06.167 --> 00:12:11.059
SAM: That could be a disaster.

00:12:11.059 --> 00:12:12.986
LIAM: Big math night.

00:12:12.986 --> 00:12:16.115
TRAVIS: Lots of algebra, trigonometry.

00:12:16.115 --> 00:12:19.240
LAURA: So we're playing as our characters, playing
a game.

00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:22.635
TRAVIS: Yep. A game within a game, if you dare.

00:12:22.635 --> 00:12:28.427
LAURA: So all we have to do is outsmart Grog?

00:12:28.427 --> 00:12:38.048
TRAVIS: Pretty much. But he is the game master,
so. Nothing to worry about. Everyone's totally

00:12:38.048 --> 00:12:40.133
safe and fine. And you're alive, by the way.

00:12:40.133 --> 00:12:43.103
LIAM: Not even thinking about it, I'm just taken
by how handsome you look tonight.

00:12:43.103 --> 00:12:50.118
TRAVIS: Oh, good! Thanks! I killed a bunch of
clickers to get here. There were some cannibals.

00:12:50.118 --> 00:12:53.073
But the Fireflies are on my six, so we should get
started.

00:12:53.073 --> 00:12:58.310
TALIESIN: You should not wear makeup more often. I
think it really brings out your-- You have a

00:12:58.310 --> 00:13:00.518
natural glow to yourself right now.

00:13:00.518 --> 00:13:04.352
LIAM: Don't worry about going gray, because it's
working.

00:13:04.352 --> 00:13:08.823
TRAVIS: It makes me look far wiser than I actually
am. I can reverse math all day.

00:13:08.823 --> 00:13:12.941
TALIESIN: So to keep things moving, because
apparently I should do that even though I'm really

00:13:12.941 --> 00:13:19.565
enjoying this: there's no Talks Machina this
Tuesday because it's Halloween. Instead of Talks

00:13:19.565 --> 00:13:27.113
Machina, you're going to enjoy Eric Campbell's
Cthulhu one-shot on the 7:00-10:00 time. Our

00:13:27.113 --> 00:13:31.765
Wednesday Club this week is going to be Japanese
influence on American comics with Erika Ishii,

00:13:31.765 --> 00:13:36.792
which should be fun. Tomorrow, we are doing our
first little Halloween fun with Gather Your Treats

00:13:36.792 --> 00:13:45.693
on Gather Your Party. You're going to see my real
Halloween costume, which is not on theme with this

00:13:45.693 --> 00:13:50.667
episode. Oh, it's fancy as fuck. It's bad.

00:13:50.667 --> 00:13:52.149
LIAM: I feel fancy as fuck.

00:13:52.149 --> 00:13:53.881
TALIESIN: You look fancy as fuck.

00:13:53.881 --> 00:13:56.262
LAURA: You're like, Fallout Glamor.

00:13:56.262 --> 00:14:02.686
LIAM: Yeah, we got a map tonight, so we're fine.
There's Geek &amp; Sundry right there. There's the

00:14:02.686 --> 00:14:05.615
Burbank Airport. Let me check my data. Oh, it's
all the secrets!

00:14:05.615 --> 00:14:10.115
TALIESIN: So I apologize, things are going to be a
little weird tonight. I've got some tech things

00:14:10.115 --> 00:14:14.266
that I'm still figuring out. But in the meantime,
I think that's the end of announcements.

00:14:14.266 --> 00:14:18.842
LIAM: Oh nope! There's one last little thing.
Starting next week, we're going to be doing a

00:14:18.842 --> 00:14:26.923
last, final round of Vox Machina character
playlists. Whoa. Not everybody's ready. Mine is

00:14:26.923 --> 00:14:30.825
ready, so we'll start with me. Probably Keyleth
after that, and then we'll figure out from there.

00:14:30.825 --> 00:14:33.507
TALIESIN: I've got, like, half of one. I'll finish
it up.

00:14:33.507 --> 00:14:37.009
LAURA: Yeah, I've got some really good songs, but
I don't have all my songs.

00:14:37.009 --> 00:14:39.599
LIAM: Well, you've got about three or four weeks
to figure that out.

00:14:39.599 --> 00:14:41.534
LAURA: Yeah, it's fine. I've got plenty of time.

00:14:41.534 --> 00:14:48.610
TRAVIS: We do have one extra announcement. I
forgot. November 17th, some of us will be

00:14:48.610 --> 00:14:55.181
attending PAX Unplugged in Philadelphia. There
will be Matt and Marisha. Taliesin. Liam will be

00:14:55.181 --> 00:14:57.292
making it. Laura and I will be in Australia,
unfortunately.

00:14:57.292 --> 00:14:59.362
LAURA: Yes, at Supanova, come see!

00:14:59.362 --> 00:15:04.332
TRAVIS: Sam can't make it, but the four of them
will be intrepidly braving the Philadelphia PAX

00:15:04.332 --> 00:15:06.577
Unplugged. You're such a goober.

00:15:06.577 --> 00:15:11.848
They'll be there. You can see them Friday
night. There will be two things. Let's make sure

00:15:11.848 --> 00:15:17.260
that I have this right. 1:00-2:30pm Eastern
Standard Time is the Critical Role panel and then

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:22.197
the signing will be 5:30-7:30 Eastern Standard
Time. PAX Unplugged on Friday. Info should be on

00:15:22.197 --> 00:15:27.930
the website. If it changes stay tuned. If you're
in that area, come out, throw things at them

00:15:27.930 --> 00:15:29.774
because we won't be there.

00:15:29.774 --> 00:15:34.695
TALIESIN: Encouraging all sorts of bad behavior.
We'll see if you live through the night. That'll

00:15:34.695 --> 00:15:42.474
be cool. I think it's time for us to take a moment
and prepare ourselves so I can get a bit of my

00:15:42.474 --> 00:15:52.437
aggravation and pent-up frustration out on you as
we start to pick up tonight's episode of Thursday

00:15:52.437 --> 00:15:57.461
by Midnight Part Two. And again thank you to White
Wolf and to Onyx for everything they've done and

00:15:57.461 --> 00:16:02.225
I'll talk a little bit about that during the game.
Thank you guys so much and let's roll the game.

00:16:02.225 --> 00:17:35.764
[dramatic music]

00:17:35.764 --> 00:17:43.905
TALIESIN: That delighted me, that didn't really
throw me, it was just pleasing. When we last left

00:17:43.905 --> 00:17:55.444
the game-- That's weird to say. We had just dove
underneath the Wednesday Club table into a

00:17:55.444 --> 00:18:08.903
mysterious hole in the back of the studio just in
time to see fire and air pressure push everything,

00:18:08.903 --> 00:18:16.430
bedlam and sounds and screams and fire above us
and thankfully you had gotten to cover underneath

00:18:16.430 --> 00:18:23.966
the table and whatever's going on up there, there's
still terrible commotion. You can hear things

00:18:23.966 --> 00:18:31.714
falling, you can hear things breaking and
shredding and the fires are obviously spreading.

00:18:31.714 --> 00:18:36.699
You can feel the heat pushing through the table.
But thankfully there seems to be some sort of

00:18:36.699 --> 00:18:38.108
break in the floor.

00:18:38.108 --> 00:18:39.623
LAURA: I found it!

00:18:39.623 --> 00:18:41.499
TALIESIN: You did find it.

00:18:41.499 --> 00:18:44.327
SAM: Good job, vampire Laura.

00:18:44.327 --> 00:18:51.363
TALIESIN: And this perhaps is how somebody got
access to this building, I don't know. Right now

00:18:51.363 --> 00:18:57.220
you've got about ten feet of clearance on the
little cap that's keeping the fire at bay. A

00:18:57.220 --> 00:18:59.076
couple of you are still a little hungry.

00:18:59.076 --> 00:19:01.435
LAURA: Just a little hungry.

00:19:01.435 --> 00:19:03.323
SAM: I'm not hungry.

00:19:03.323 --> 00:19:04.791
LAURA: You're sup-- oh, oh!

00:19:04.791 --> 00:19:05.971
TALIESIN: You're fine at the moment.

00:19:05.971 --> 00:19:06.887
SAM: Yeah.

00:19:06.887 --> 00:19:11.414
LAURA: Maybe, you guys, should I sneak ahead?
Should I obfuscate ahead?

00:19:11.414 --> 00:19:14.419
TRAVIS: Obfuscate? I don't think you used that
term correctly.

00:19:14.419 --> 00:19:15.889
LAURA: Obfuscate?

00:19:15.889 --> 00:19:17.819
TRAVIS: That means you vanish, but you've got
to hold still right?

00:19:17.819 --> 00:19:19.348
LAURA: No.

00:19:19.348 --> 00:19:24.848
SAM: Can we talk for a second about who was that
up there? Gary Gygax?

00:19:24.848 --> 00:19:29.042
TRAVIS: Yeah. And to our rescue came Matthew
Colville.

00:19:29.042 --> 00:19:30.016
SAM: Matthew Colville.

00:19:30.016 --> 00:19:33.302
Was he undead? Or was he just a man?

00:19:33.302 --> 00:19:34.602
LIAM: I think he was a vamp.

00:19:34.602 --> 00:19:35.724
LAURA and SAM: Was he?

00:19:35.724 --> 00:19:38.971
TALIESIN: He may have been a vamp, or maybe he was
just a really good guy. You don't know.

00:19:38.971 --> 00:19:41.423
TRAVIS: Did he have claws?

00:19:41.423 --> 00:19:45.539
TALIESIN: He did have claws, briefly. There was
some slight claw. You would have noticed that.

00:19:45.539 --> 00:19:50.691
LIAM: And Gary Gygax, beloved for inventing our
cherished game. I'm a snaggle tooth now.

00:19:50.691 --> 00:19:52.601
LAURA: You just took one out?

00:19:52.601 --> 00:19:56.341
LIAM: I just took one out, sure. For now. I'll
change it, it'll be different teeth at different

00:19:56.341 --> 00:20:03.645
times. Sometimes there will be none, sometimes
there will be both. Let's make it none. And Gygax

00:20:03.645 --> 00:20:08.551
had very long protruding fingers, like obscenely
long fingers, right?

00:20:08.551 --> 00:20:13.092
LAURA: Does that mean he's like, an old vampire?
Like, he's been a vampire a really long time?

00:20:13.092 --> 00:20:16.182
LIAM: I don't know. I talk into a can for a
living, I don't know.

00:20:16.182 --> 00:20:22.346
SAM: You, Liam O'Brien, know all sorts of stuff
about vampires. I, Sam Riegel, do not.

00:20:22.346 --> 00:20:27.486
LIAM: I saw The Lost Boys, that doesn't tell me
anything about vampires. It's in the movies.

00:20:27.486 --> 00:20:29.071
SAM: I didn't even see Interview With A Vampire.

00:20:29.071 --> 00:20:30.327
LAURA: It was so good.

00:20:30.327 --> 00:20:31.238
SAM: Was it?

00:20:31.238 --> 00:20:32.157
LAURA: Yeah.

00:20:32.157 --> 00:20:35.933
LIAM: Guys, we are going to die or undie or
something, can we focus in on what are we going to

00:20:35.933 --> 00:20:37.426
do? Dani's dead.

00:20:37.426 --> 00:20:42.132
LAURA: We don't know that they're all dead, we
just know the Twitch studio has exploded. For all we

00:20:42.132 --> 00:20:46.589
know, the rest of Legendary is still there.

00:20:46.589 --> 00:20:48.873
SAM: Well, we're not going back there now, it blew
up.

00:20:48.873 --> 00:20:50.053
LAURA: Fuck, no.

00:20:50.053 --> 00:20:51.977
TRAVIS: Is the tunnel backup blocked by debris and
other--

00:20:51.977 --> 00:20:53.816
TALIESIN: To go back up?

00:20:53.816 --> 00:20:54.720
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm.

00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:57.547
TALIESIN: You can't tell, but you're welcome to
find out.

00:20:57.547 --> 00:21:00.111
TRAVIS: Well jesus, Taliesin.

00:21:00.111 --> 00:21:03.519
LIAM: Does my iPhone have any service?

00:21:03.519 --> 00:21:08.197
TALIESIN: If you recall, you got buried without
your iPhones last time.

00:21:08.197 --> 00:21:11.940
TRAVIS: Oh that's right. We didn't have our phones
in the first place. So that thing on your wrist is--

00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:15.091
TALIESIN: You're going to have to read a book like
somebody from the olden days now.

00:21:15.091 --> 00:21:21.011
TRAVIS: Being that I have heightened senses, what
can I see in our new under the earth situation?

00:21:21.011 --> 00:21:28.366
TALIESIN: Just because I feel like being a bit of
a jerk, if you're going to use your heightened

00:21:28.366 --> 00:21:30.626
senses just burn a hunger.

00:21:30.626 --> 00:21:32.008
TRAVIS: Okay.

00:21:32.008 --> 00:21:35.538
TALIESIN: Actually, give me a hunger roll, I'm
going to do something different. Just roll a d10,

00:21:35.538 --> 00:21:36.653
tell me what you get.

00:21:36.653 --> 00:21:37.860
TRAVIS: Just a red d10?

00:21:37.860 --> 00:21:39.317
TALIESIN: Yeah, just a red d10.

00:21:39.317 --> 00:21:40.346
TRAVIS: Six.

00:21:40.346 --> 00:21:41.591
TALIESIN: All right, you're fine.

00:21:41.591 --> 00:21:43.457
TRAVIS: A six and above is a success right?

00:21:43.457 --> 00:21:44.646
LAURA: I have to remember, yeah I have to remember
what is--

00:21:44.646 --> 00:21:48.101
TALIESIN: Six and above is a success, and then
you'll always have to roll your red dice. You can

00:21:48.101 --> 00:21:49.436
lose them and gain them.

00:21:49.436 --> 00:21:52.925
LIAM: This is a really character-heavy question.
Does anyone have an extra pencil?

00:21:52.925 --> 00:21:53.974
TRAVIS: Yep.

00:21:53.974 --> 00:21:56.077
LIAM: No!

00:21:56.077 --> 00:21:57.916
LAURA: No, don't throw things!

00:21:57.916 --> 00:22:06.482
TALIESIN: This tunnel that you're in, from what you
can see, somebody burrowed somehow. Some creature

00:22:06.482 --> 00:22:14.513
made this. And it's just big enough for like about
two people. And it goes down into a larger tunnel

00:22:14.513 --> 00:22:16.875
directly below you. It's like a little offset.

00:22:16.875 --> 00:22:18.832
LAURA: Do we hear any sounds coming from the
tunnel?

00:22:18.832 --> 00:22:20.595
TALIESIN: Do you hear sounds coming from the iPad?
Let me find out.

00:22:20.595 --> 00:22:26.475
TRAVIS: Do we see any slime or hair or anything
that's like "Oh this is a--?"

00:22:26.475 --> 00:22:31.923
TALIESIN: You can hear the faint distant
sound of a little bit of water, a little moisture

00:22:31.923 --> 00:22:38.296
and it's a big tunnel so down there it could be
anything. There's definitely some sound down there.

00:22:38.296 --> 00:22:40.535
SAM: We can't go back up, it exploded.

00:22:40.535 --> 00:22:43.650
LAURA: No, our only choice is to travel
underground.

00:22:43.650 --> 00:22:46.535
LIAM: You should probably do that obfuscate thing
that you've talked about.

00:22:46.535 --> 00:22:47.672
LAURA: I want to.

00:22:47.672 --> 00:22:52.475
TRAVIS: Or, or we can do the thing that we've
learned from being Vox Machina for so long. Who's

00:22:52.475 --> 00:22:53.964
super fast, like the Flash?

00:22:53.964 --> 00:22:54.756
SAM: I am.

00:22:54.756 --> 00:22:58.722
TRAVIS: Yeah, you should run ahead, dart ahead of
all of the rest of us and check it out.

00:22:58.722 --> 00:23:04.721
SAM: But I, unlike Vax from Vox Machina, don't
have darkvision. Do we have anything that glows?

00:23:04.721 --> 00:23:05.913
LAURA: We can see.

00:23:05.913 --> 00:23:07.549
TALIESIN: You can see okay. You can't see as well
as he can.

00:23:07.549 --> 00:23:10.209
SAM: All right.

00:23:10.209 --> 00:23:13.407
LIAM: Is above sealed? Help me visualize what's
above us.

00:23:13.407 --> 00:23:17.547
TALIESIN: So above you, you're down in a little
bit of a tunnel and it's at a bit of an angle and

00:23:17.547 --> 00:23:25.288
the basically giant circular manhole that is that
table has stamped down and seems to be pressured

00:23:25.288 --> 00:23:26.384
down at the moment.

00:23:26.384 --> 00:23:27.839
LIAM: So we're not getting any firelight or
anything?

00:23:27.839 --> 00:23:30.763
TALIESIN: No, you're feeling some heat but you're
not getting any firelight.

00:23:30.763 --> 00:23:33.287
LIAM: I'm not seeing anything.

00:23:33.287 --> 00:23:36.514
TALIESIN: He can kind of see something, and
there's a little light coming from the bottom of

00:23:36.514 --> 00:23:38.244
the tunnel. There's just enough to make out
some--

00:23:38.244 --> 00:23:40.787
TRAVIS: There's just enough light coming from the
bottom of the tunnel?

00:23:40.787 --> 00:23:42.629
TALIESIN: Just at the very bottom there's enough.

00:23:42.629 --> 00:23:46.306
LIAM: Definitely Sam or Laura or Travis should go
ahead.

00:23:46.306 --> 00:23:49.592
TRAVIS: I think that's a good idea.

00:23:49.592 --> 00:23:53.109
LAURA: I think that's a really good idea, Liam.
You should stay here and be safe.

00:23:53.109 --> 00:23:56.015
TRAVIS: Good call. Yeah, I'm glad we agree.

00:23:56.015 --> 00:23:58.850
LIAM: Let the brain hang back and figure shit out,
right?

00:23:58.850 --> 00:24:05.854
TRAVIS: I will kill him first.

00:24:05.854 --> 00:24:08.406
SAM: Do you want me to go down there?

00:24:08.406 --> 00:24:10.571
LAURA: Do it, go so fast.

00:24:10.571 --> 00:24:14.174
SAM: I'm going to go so fast and dart ahead like
40 feet.

00:24:14.174 --> 00:24:16.512
TALIESIN: You're going to go so fast like PacMan?

00:24:16.512 --> 00:24:17.661
SAM: Yeah.

00:24:17.661 --> 00:24:18.520
TALIESIN: All right.

00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:21.269
LAURA: Or I could sneak down because people can't
see me if I do it well.

00:24:21.269 --> 00:24:22.608
TRAVIS: Yeah, either one of two.

00:24:22.608 --> 00:24:23.873
SAM: Maybe we should do that.

00:24:23.873 --> 00:24:24.903
TRAVIS: Yeah, do that.

00:24:24.903 --> 00:24:27.228
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to do that. He's not going
to go fast, I'm going to sneak in.

00:24:27.228 --> 00:24:31.208
TALIESIN: You have to do a roll, don't you, or do
you just have to--

00:24:31.208 --> 00:24:33.915
LAURA: I'll go caw caw.

00:24:33.915 --> 00:24:38.182
TALIESIN: Oh, no you don't, you're fine. Roll a
d10, tell me what you get.

00:24:38.182 --> 00:24:39.506
LAURA: The red?

00:24:39.506 --> 00:24:40.728
TALIESIN: Yeah.

00:24:40.728 --> 00:24:41.952
LAURA: Two.

00:24:41.952 --> 00:24:46.945
TALIESIN: You get one point of hunger. You're
fine, you're going to do it, but here have a--

00:24:46.945 --> 00:24:48.617
LAURA: I get hungrier, but I can do it.

00:24:48.617 --> 00:24:49.713
TALIESIN: You get a little hungrier.

00:24:49.713 --> 00:24:50.940
LAURA: Okay.

00:24:50.940 --> 00:25:00.805
TALIESIN: But yeah, so you sneak down and the
tunnel is larger than you'd expect. It's 12 feet

00:25:00.805 --> 00:25:02.192
in diameter.

00:25:02.192 --> 00:25:04.781
LAURA: Okay. I got hungrier, so I've got to put my
fangs back in you guys.

00:25:04.781 --> 00:25:05.743
SAM: Sure.

00:25:05.743 --> 00:25:14.437
TALIESIN: It's a carved out tunnel, but not a
technically carved tunnel. There's like some

00:25:14.437 --> 00:25:22.967
animals that burrowed this big hole but 
did it very well. Something made this with some

00:25:22.967 --> 00:25:29.383
skill, but it's not modern. There's something
weirdly ancient and a little unsettling about the

00:25:29.383 --> 00:25:34.570
whole tunnel. It's not a sewer. You were
expecting a sewer. It's not there.

00:25:34.570 --> 00:25:37.005
LAURA: Does it feel stable?

00:25:37.005 --> 00:25:41.335
TALIESIN: It looks very stable and it looks like
it's been there a long time.

00:25:41.335 --> 00:25:42.632
LAURA: What does it smell like?

00:25:42.632 --> 00:25:50.277
TALIESIN: It smells slightly sour, like the algae
that is growing on the walls, this white

00:25:50.277 --> 00:25:54.967
crystalline algae that gives off a very gentle
glow.

00:25:54.967 --> 00:25:56.691
LAURA: Oh! So I can see!

00:25:56.691 --> 00:25:58.075
TALIESIN: Just a hint.

00:25:58.075 --> 00:26:00.281
LAURA: I'm going to lick the algae.

00:26:00.281 --> 00:26:05.747
SAM: Oh god. Last time someone licked something,
tasted something--

00:26:05.747 --> 00:26:06.818
TALIESIN: You're going to lick the algae?

00:26:06.818 --> 00:26:09.628
LAURA: Just, like, a little lick.

00:26:09.628 --> 00:26:10.842
TALIESIN: A little lick the algae?

00:26:10.842 --> 00:26:12.308
LAURA: Not like a big, big lick.

00:26:12.308 --> 00:26:14.532
SAM: That looks so gross with the teeth. The
tongue with the-- ugh.

00:26:14.532 --> 00:26:18.816
TALIESIN: I'm going to say it tastes like algae.

00:26:18.816 --> 00:26:21.863
LAURA: Hmm. Not like rat droppings?

00:26:21.863 --> 00:26:29.414
TALIESIN: No. I mean, it tastes awful. It tastes
of putrescense and death and awful. This shit is

00:26:29.414 --> 00:26:30.732
disgusting.

00:26:30.732 --> 00:26:33.631
TRAVIS: Well, we know you're fans of rats, but--

00:26:33.631 --> 00:26:36.297
LAURA: I know. I am.

00:26:36.297 --> 00:26:38.246
SAM: How's it look down there, Laura?

00:26:38.246 --> 00:26:42.004
LAURA: Shut up! I keep going forward.

00:26:42.004 --> 00:26:43.942
LIAM: She's got this.

00:26:43.942 --> 00:26:45.436
TALIESIN: The tunnel goes down--

00:26:45.436 --> 00:26:46.542
LAURA: It keeps going?

00:26:46.542 --> 00:26:50.442
TALIESIN: The tunnel keeps going. You can't see
the end of it.

00:26:50.442 --> 00:26:56.427
LAURA: Oh. Okay, wait. I go back to them. Follow
behind me, but not right behind me.

00:26:56.427 --> 00:26:57.928
TRAVIS: How far behind you?

00:26:57.928 --> 00:27:03.185
LAURA: Just, you know, whatever. Like 50
feet behind me. Is that far?

00:27:03.185 --> 00:27:06.777
TALIESIN: Oh man.

00:27:06.777 --> 00:27:09.369
LIAM: That's like here to the door out to the--

00:27:09.369 --> 00:27:16.109
LAURA: Yeah! And then unless I make noise like a
scream or something then you know it's safe, you

00:27:16.109 --> 00:27:17.493
can keep coming forward.

00:27:17.493 --> 00:27:20.677
LIAM: I mean, you're not really human anymore,
you're kind of tough now.

00:27:20.677 --> 00:27:21.996
LAURA: Yeah, I'm so tough.

00:27:21.996 --> 00:27:25.220
TRAVIS: We will follow not so closely behind.

00:27:25.220 --> 00:27:27.254
SAM, LIAM, and LAURA: Yep.

00:27:27.254 --> 00:27:28.595
LIAM: I'll be 51 feet behind.

00:27:28.595 --> 00:27:29.970
LAURA: And I go back to where I was and keep
walking.

00:27:29.970 --> 00:27:31.629
LIAM: Yessir.

00:27:31.629 --> 00:27:35.946
LAURA: Holy shit, it's like catacombs. Is this
serious?

00:27:35.946 --> 00:27:38.169
TALIESIN: This is so serious.

00:27:38.169 --> 00:27:40.289
LAURA: This is serious.

00:27:40.289 --> 00:27:43.909
SAM: Guys, I took off my shoes and I've got to say
it feels so much better.

00:27:43.909 --> 00:27:45.272
LAURA: Yeah?

00:27:45.272 --> 00:27:48.884
LIAM: Not doing a good job of quelling the serial
killer thing, Sam.

00:27:48.884 --> 00:27:51.509
LAURA: You are really creepy looking.

00:27:51.509 --> 00:27:56.972
SAM: It's the eyebrows. Well, I put on this part
and I was like it needs something else.

00:27:56.972 --> 00:28:01.765
TALIESIN: It's genuinely distracting.

00:28:01.765 --> 00:28:08.910
TRAVIS: You look like if the clown from Spawn was
trying to be PacMan. Pac McFarlane. PacMan.

00:28:08.910 --> 00:28:16.642
TALIESIN: You're probably not going to really run
into anything for about a quarter of a mile in

00:28:16.642 --> 00:28:22.380
going down. And eventually after about a
quarter mile you can see a place where the modern

00:28:22.380 --> 00:28:28.557
sewer system has cut through this tunnel. Like
someone hit this and decided to keep going. And so

00:28:28.557 --> 00:28:35.624
there's a sewer system that's obviously city sewer
although very old. coming out at an angle, hits

00:28:35.624 --> 00:28:43.409
this tunnel, ignores it and continues in an odd
way. And this tunnel also keeps going around the

00:28:43.409 --> 00:28:44.807
corner so you can--

00:28:44.807 --> 00:28:45.768
LAURA: I can choose?

00:28:45.768 --> 00:28:46.772
TALIESIN: There's some options.

00:28:46.772 --> 00:28:53.831
LAURA: Okay guys! It intersects with the sewer.
There's got to be so many rats in the sewer.

00:28:53.831 --> 00:28:56.039
SAM: Oh yeah. You could have a feast!

00:28:56.039 --> 00:28:58.181
LAURA: Here's the thing.

00:28:58.342 --> 00:28:59.192
SAM: I don't eat rats.

00:28:59.192 --> 00:29:00.723
LIAM: She doesn't either. You don't eat rats?

00:29:00.723 --> 00:29:01.856
TRAVIS: You just eat people now.

00:29:01.856 --> 00:29:03.508
LAURA: Y'all, rats are super good.

00:29:03.508 --> 00:29:04.582
LIAM: What do you mean?

00:29:04.582 --> 00:29:05.957
LAURA: They're like so fucking good.

00:29:05.957 --> 00:29:07.239
TRAVIS: Sofa king?

00:29:07.239 --> 00:29:08.611
LIAM: Sofa king.

00:29:08.611 --> 00:29:14.741
LAURA: Sofa king delicious. But here's the thing.
This tunnel intersects with the sewer. We can

00:29:14.741 --> 00:29:20.120
either continue through this tunnel and try
to figure out, I don't know, why we're

00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:25.773
vampires and see if there's some source to this
power or we go to the sewer and we live.

00:29:25.773 --> 00:29:27.957
TRAVIS: Live there?

00:29:27.957 --> 00:29:29.226
SAM: You mean live forever in the sewers?

00:29:29.226 --> 00:29:31.174
LAURA: Yeah. We can hide out in the sewers under
LA.

00:29:31.174 --> 00:29:32.190
SAM: What if we need--

00:29:32.190 --> 00:29:33.999
TALIESIN: I'm so into this plan.

00:29:33.999 --> 00:29:36.790
TRAVIS: What happened to you in that coffin?
We're talking about you.

00:29:36.790 --> 00:29:40.351
SAM: Don't you want to solve this? There's got to
be a cure right?

00:29:40.351 --> 00:29:42.757
LAURA: Look, wait, we're fucked. We're vampires.

00:29:42.757 --> 00:29:47.216
LIAM: We can but, yeah, let me pitch something
here. Like we're all tired. We have day jobs.

00:29:47.216 --> 00:29:48.637
SAM: Are we?

00:29:48.637 --> 00:29:49.362
LIAM: I am.

00:29:49.362 --> 00:29:50.442
SAM: Taliesin, are we tired?

00:29:50.442 --> 00:29:52.693
LIAM: That's not what I'm talking about, I mean in
general.

00:29:52.693 --> 00:29:53.876
TALIESIN: Liam's tired.

00:29:53.876 --> 00:30:02.204
LIAM: We got day jobs. We got night jobs. We work
a lot. We could be princes and queens of death now.

00:30:02.204 --> 00:30:08.035
SAM: Who's thinking princes and queens of death?
We almost were killed by werewolves and bigger

00:30:08.035 --> 00:30:09.146
vampires.

00:30:09.146 --> 00:30:10.464
LAURA: There's probably other things that are
scary.

00:30:10.464 --> 00:30:15.599
SAM: We'd be the lowest-- I don't know anything
about vampires, but we could be private first

00:30:15.599 --> 00:30:16.685
class vampires.

00:30:16.685 --> 00:30:18.171
TRAVIS: Wait, didn't a week go by?

00:30:18.171 --> 00:30:23.095
LIAM: Husbo, you are two hours into being a
vampire, if that. You just learned how to run, who

00:30:23.095 --> 00:30:24.531
knows what else you're going to learn?

00:30:24.531 --> 00:30:25.360
LAURA: True.

00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:28.029
SAM: I also learned that I could kill a man in
seconds flat.

00:30:28.029 --> 00:30:29.265
LIAM: That's hot.

00:30:29.265 --> 00:30:32.992
TRAVIS: Wait, raise your hand if you've killed
somebody? A person?

00:30:32.992 --> 00:30:34.561
TALIESIN: Oh, wait, sorry. Carry on.

00:30:34.561 --> 00:30:37.976
SAM: I killed a person, I don't know what came
over me. It was amazing.

00:30:37.976 --> 00:30:40.027
LIAM: Did I kill that guy? Did I kill Max when I
ate him?

00:30:40.027 --> 00:30:42.995
TRAVIS: Yeah. Wait no.

00:30:42.995 --> 00:30:44.226
SAM: I killed Max.

00:30:44.226 --> 00:30:47.497
TRAVIS: Oh, you left him for dead. Okay. I'm just
checking to make sure like--

00:30:47.497 --> 00:30:49.600
TALIESIN: I think Sam's the only one who's
actually--

00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:51.703
TRAVIS: Might be holding onto this for no good
reason.

00:30:51.703 --> 00:30:58.535
LAURA: Technically I did too, but it's not
important.

00:30:58.535 --> 00:30:59.807
LIAM: Who was it?

00:30:59.807 --> 00:31:01.318
LAURA: It's just a chick.

00:31:01.318 --> 00:31:02.753
SAM: Wait, who did you kill?

00:31:02.753 --> 00:31:04.891
LAURA: It's just this chick, up in the Smart
Girls.

00:31:04.891 --> 00:31:06.298
SAM: Did you know who she was?

00:31:06.298 --> 00:31:08.484
LAURA: No I didn't know her, remember we were
there fucking together?

00:31:08.484 --> 00:31:12.065
SAM: Oh, that girl, yeah. And I guess I probably
caused that other boy to die.

00:31:12.065 --> 00:31:15.402
LIAM: That's the worst thing to say dressed like
PacMan.

00:31:15.402 --> 00:31:18.172
SAM: I've killed two people, Travis.

00:31:18.172 --> 00:31:22.876
TALIESIN: You dress like that, you also eat their ghosts
so they're like the soulless, really. Sorry.

00:31:22.923 --> 00:31:27.993
LAURA: Look, Travis, not all of us have willpower
like you. I get really hungry and if I don't eat,

00:31:27.993 --> 00:31:29.598
I get really angry.

00:31:29.598 --> 00:31:31.785
TRAVIS: No, that's the truth, preach. I know.

00:31:31.785 --> 00:31:40.778
LIAM: And also I'm really shy and awkward right,
but as a vampire it can only get better, right?

00:31:40.778 --> 00:31:45.568
SAM: So we're just committing? After an hour of
being a vampire we're saying, "You know what, fuck

00:31:45.568 --> 00:31:47.127
"it, let's be vampires forever."

00:31:47.127 --> 00:31:48.183
LIAM: I mean, I am.

00:31:48.183 --> 00:31:53.775
LAURA: Here's the thing, we could record at night.
After a few days with these teeth, I think I'll

00:31:53.775 --> 00:31:55.333
get used to talking with them.

00:31:55.333 --> 00:31:59.606
SAM: It's going to really hurt your commercial
auditions.

00:31:59.606 --> 00:32:01.682
LAURA: I know but I don't do very many of them.

00:32:01.682 --> 00:32:03.264
SAM: Really? You have a good commercial voice.

00:32:03.264 --> 00:32:04.483
LAURA: Really? You think so?

00:32:04.483 --> 00:32:06.552
SAM: Yeah, I think so. Young mom.

00:32:06.552 --> 00:32:08.696
LAURA: Thanks.

00:32:08.696 --> 00:32:09.929
SAM: Sure.

00:32:09.929 --> 00:32:14.388
TRAVIS: Forever. Let's go see the sewer a little
more closely. I feel weird about this.

00:32:14.388 --> 00:32:15.824
LAURA: About what?

00:32:15.824 --> 00:32:19.041
TRAVIS: Just committing to being-- I don't know if
I want to stay this way.

00:32:19.041 --> 00:32:22.491
LAURA: I mean we can go, we can keep looking. We
might die.

00:32:22.491 --> 00:32:23.841
TRAVIS: I like the sun. It's warm--

00:32:23.841 --> 00:32:25.250
SAM: Yeah, sports are played there.

00:32:25.250 --> 00:32:27.882
TRAVIS: Yeah. I mean, there are night games but--

00:32:27.882 --> 00:32:31.815
LAURA: That's true. You can't swim at the beach
and stuff.

00:32:31.815 --> 00:32:36.839
TRAVIS: I mean, you can, it's just super dark and
swimming in the ocean at night is scary.

00:32:36.839 --> 00:32:38.400
LIAM: There might be underground lakes in here.

00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:39.936
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:32:39.936 --> 00:32:45.284
LAURA: You know, in one of the games I did where I
was a vampire, vampires are allergic to water.

00:32:45.284 --> 00:32:47.267
TRAVIS: All water?

00:32:47.267 --> 00:32:51.706
LAURA: Yeah. I don't know if that's true or not.
Oh, is there water in the sewer?

00:32:51.706 --> 00:32:53.274
TALIESIN: There's a little bit of water in the
sewer.

00:32:53.274 --> 00:32:54.996
LAURA: I'm going to wind over and put my hand in
it and let--

00:32:54.996 --> 00:33:00.474
TALIESIN: That's disgusting and probably will give
you pink eye. You'll eventually get to find out if

00:33:00.474 --> 00:33:03.515
vampires get pink eye. I don't know and that's a
question for--

00:33:03.515 --> 00:33:04.986
LAURA: Did it hurt though?

00:33:04.986 --> 00:33:06.364
TALIESIN: No, it didn't hurt.

00:33:06.364 --> 00:33:08.393
LAURA: Okay, then I don't think we're allergic to
water.

00:33:08.393 --> 00:33:10.416
LIAM: Okay. So we're not Nazgul.

00:33:10.416 --> 00:33:17.704
Jeez, all kinds of things are changing now.

00:33:17.704 --> 00:33:22.285
SAM: His vampire powers are amazing. He 
clutched this very warm mug.

00:33:22.348 --> 00:33:28.196
LAURA: So what do you think? Do you want to go to
the tunnels some more?

00:33:28.196 --> 00:33:32.024
LIAM: Yeah we've got to progress our lives, our
unlives further so we can't stay here arguing

00:33:32.024 --> 00:33:33.377
whatever we're going to do.

00:33:33.377 --> 00:33:34.421
TRAVIS: Yeah, we've got to go forward.

00:33:34.421 --> 00:33:35.588
LIAM: I want to be a vampire.

00:33:35.588 --> 00:33:36.524
LAURA: You want to stay a vampire?

00:33:36.524 --> 00:33:37.420
LIAM: I'm fucking in.

00:33:37.420 --> 00:33:40.212
TRAVIS: I have amazing senses, I hear everything
that you're saying.

00:33:40.212 --> 00:33:41.683
LIAM: I'm not hiding this from you, Travis.

00:33:41.683 --> 00:33:43.276
TRAVIS: Then why are you directing it towards her
shoulder?

00:33:43.276 --> 00:33:47.984
SAM: I just touched myself and you didn't know
because I'm so fast that I--

00:33:47.984 --> 00:33:49.913
TRAVIS: No, I knew that too.

00:33:49.913 --> 00:33:51.931
TALIESIN: You also didn't feel it because you're
so fast.

00:33:51.931 --> 00:33:53.499
LAURA: Aw, you didn't feel anything.

00:33:53.499 --> 00:33:54.284
TALIESIN: No.

00:33:54.284 --> 00:33:55.391
SAM: Just adjusted a little bit.

00:33:55.391 --> 00:33:56.445
TRAVIS: Just a tremor.

00:33:56.445 --> 00:33:58.410
LIAM: I'm not hiding anything from you. We'll
bring you around.

00:33:58.410 --> 00:34:03.994
TALIESIN: Since you do have heightened senses, you
can hear some tiny bit of rattling around down one

00:34:03.994 --> 00:34:07.319
of the sewer tunnels. You can hear some tiny bit
of rattling around further down.

00:34:07.319 --> 00:34:12.061
TRAVIS: Oh wait! Shh. I actually hear something
down this way.

00:34:12.061 --> 00:34:12.884
SAM: Let's go!

00:34:12.884 --> 00:34:13.837
LAURA: Should we go to the path?

00:34:13.837 --> 00:34:14.494
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:34:14.494 --> 00:34:15.393
SAM: Are you on point?

00:34:15.393 --> 00:34:18.366
LAURA: But don't forget, this is where the tunnel
continues on from where Geek and Sundry was.

00:34:18.366 --> 00:34:20.905
TRAVIS: No, we're going this way.

00:34:20.905 --> 00:34:22.090
LAURA: Okay.

00:34:22.090 --> 00:34:23.563
TRAVIS: We'll go towards that noise.

00:34:23.563 --> 00:34:30.990
TALIESIN: You head down. It's about 200 feet
before you get to a sewer lock off where there's

00:34:30.990 --> 00:34:41.623
an old power box and a small grate system that the
water flows through, but things do not. There are

00:34:41.623 --> 00:34:53.284
definitely some rats rolling around, and there's a
weird brick square chimney that goes off up into

00:34:53.284 --> 00:35:01.222
god knows where and on the side of the wall is a
small lock box/power box with some very old

00:35:01.222 --> 00:35:04.951
signage on it that's a little hard to read.

00:35:04.951 --> 00:35:06.728
LIAM: I'll give it a shot.

00:35:06.728 --> 00:35:12.321
TRAVIS: Can I snag one of the rats and fucking rip
its head off? And squeeze it like a thing of

00:35:12.321 --> 00:35:13.468
toothpaste?

00:35:13.468 --> 00:35:14.942
TALIESIN: Give me a dex brawl.

00:35:14.942 --> 00:35:16.637
LIAM: Like an Otter Pop.

00:35:16.637 --> 00:35:18.153
LAURA: Gross.

00:35:18.153 --> 00:35:19.582
SAM: Like a Hi-Chew.

00:35:19.582 --> 00:35:20.794
TALIESIN: Hi-Chew.

00:35:20.794 --> 00:35:31.064
TRAVIS: Dex brawl. All the dice. Three successes,
two failures. But none of them are red.

00:35:31.064 --> 00:35:35.186
TALIESIN: Three successes, two failures? Not two
ones though?

00:35:35.186 --> 00:35:38.201
TRAVIS: Two ones, but they're black ones.

00:35:38.201 --> 00:35:43.340
TALIESIN: They're black ones. Three successes, two
black ones. It's hard to read the handwriting,

00:35:43.340 --> 00:35:46.217
it's a little tricky. Oh no, you were going for
the rat.

00:35:46.217 --> 00:35:47.999
TRAVIS: I was going for the rat, yeah. Toothpaste
rat.

00:35:47.999 --> 00:35:49.299
TALIESIN: You did not grab the rat.

00:35:49.299 --> 00:35:50.277
TRAVIS: Damn it!

00:35:50.277 --> 00:35:51.297
TALIESIN: The rat got away.

00:35:51.297 --> 00:35:55.362
TRAVIS: Fuck! I should have eaten somebody. I'm so
hungry, I've got all these red dice.

00:35:55.362 --> 00:35:58.150
LIAM: Let's read the handwriting.

00:35:58.150 --> 00:36:00.472
TALIESIN: Yeah! Give me a perception awareness.

00:36:00.472 --> 00:36:02.458
LIAM: A perception and awareness. That's not bad.

00:36:02.458 --> 00:36:03.421
TALIESIN: No.

00:36:03.421 --> 00:36:05.970
LIAM: That's not bad. Let's see.

00:36:05.970 --> 00:36:09.000
LAURA: Can I try to get a rat? Because I'm really
good at it now.

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:11.814
TALIESIN: Dex and athletics.

00:36:11.814 --> 00:36:16.271
LIAM: I did really well in school. Except that's
cocked. I should just take the six. So I got an X,

00:36:16.271 --> 00:36:27.099
I got a one on the red, and an eight. One, two,
three. Three successes and one--

00:36:27.099 --> 00:36:28.450
TALIESIN: And one blood failure.

00:36:28.450 --> 00:36:29.990
LIAM: Yeah.

00:36:29.990 --> 00:36:42.519
TALIESIN: It's really hard to read. Somebody
scratched this in. It takes you a minute. It does

00:36:42.519 --> 00:36:44.069
say "sanctuary."

00:36:44.069 --> 00:36:46.381
LIAM: It says skanktuary.

00:36:46.381 --> 00:36:55.794
TALIESIN: Skanktuary. With a little arrow facing
the way you came and either a cross or a T or

00:36:55.794 --> 00:37:01.499
something below it. And the box has definitely
been broken into. There used to be a lock on the

00:37:01.499 --> 00:37:04.469
box, but the lock is broken. What did you roll?

00:37:04.469 --> 00:37:05.883
LAURA: I rolled two successes.

00:37:05.883 --> 00:37:08.684
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, you got it. Give me a blood die
back.

00:37:08.684 --> 00:37:10.980
LAURA: Yay! Can I try to catch one for Travis?

00:37:10.980 --> 00:37:12.268
TALIESIN: Yes you can.

00:37:12.268 --> 00:37:14.183
LAURA: Is it Dex brawl again?

00:37:14.183 --> 00:37:15.483
TALIESIN: Dex brawl.

00:37:15.483 --> 00:37:21.291
LAURA: Whoa! Critical success!

00:37:21.291 --> 00:37:23.252
TALIESIN: Very nice.

00:37:23.252 --> 00:37:25.010
LAURA: Oh, but I got a one on one of my red.

00:37:25.010 --> 00:37:29.336
TALIESIN: It takes you a minute, but you get one.
You get a nice big one for Travis. So you can--

00:37:29.336 --> 00:37:30.721
TRAVIS: I can get rid of one of these?

00:37:30.721 --> 00:37:31.697
TALIESIN: You can get rid of one of these.

00:37:31.697 --> 00:37:32.735
TRAVIS: Yes!

00:37:32.735 --> 00:37:36.919
TRAVIS: (gulping and slurping)

00:37:36.919 --> 00:37:39.209
TALIESIN: It makes a bit of a mess.

00:37:39.209 --> 00:37:40.565
LIAM: That is disgusting.

00:37:40.565 --> 00:37:41.680
TRAVIS: What? I'm trying to embrace it.

00:37:41.680 --> 00:37:44.957
LIAM: I'll wait for a person, thanks. This says
"Sanctuary."

00:37:44.957 --> 00:37:46.828
LAURA: I can make rat hamburgers.

00:37:46.828 --> 00:37:51.396
LIAM: And we know that shit was going on in this
building for a while before we were let in on it.

00:37:51.396 --> 00:37:58.561
So I don't know. Maybe a hideout that's been under
here for a while that we didn't know? While vamps

00:37:58.561 --> 00:37:59.505
were getting--

00:37:59.505 --> 00:38:00.895
LAURA: I'm less hungry, I can take my teeth out.

00:38:00.895 --> 00:38:04.315
SAM: That's what you've established now?

00:38:04.315 --> 00:38:07.826
LAURA: Never mind, they won't come out. I'm stuck
like this.

00:38:07.826 --> 00:38:09.043
LIAM: Yes you are.

00:38:09.043 --> 00:38:10.115
TRAVIS: Forever.

00:38:10.115 --> 00:38:13.078
SAM: Is there a way to continue on down the sewer
path or that's it?

00:38:13.078 --> 00:38:18.518
TALIESIN: There's some attempts you could make,
but the sewer path is definitely treacherous at

00:38:18.518 --> 00:38:19.559
this point.

00:38:19.559 --> 00:38:20.519
SAM: All right, let's turn around.

00:38:20.519 --> 00:38:21.647
LAURA: Let's go to the sanctuary.

00:38:21.647 --> 00:38:22.925
TRAVIS: Okay.

00:38:22.925 --> 00:38:25.961
SAM: If we follow the arrow where the sanctuary
was pointing.

00:38:25.961 --> 00:38:27.440
TALIESIN: Further down that old tunnel?

00:38:27.440 --> 00:38:28.694
SAM: Yeah.

00:38:28.694 --> 00:38:29.976
TRAVIS: Yeah, let's do that.

00:38:29.976 --> 00:38:42.300
TALIESIN: All right. This tunnel goes on for a
long time. What would I call this? If anyone wants

00:38:42.300 --> 00:38:44.318
to make another perception awareness.

00:38:44.318 --> 00:38:45.380
LAURA: I will!

00:38:45.380 --> 00:38:47.103
LIAM: I will. Okay, Laura's going first.

00:38:47.103 --> 00:38:49.395
TRAVIS: Oh, me too because I'm actually perceptive
for once.

00:38:49.395 --> 00:38:50.914
SAM: I don't give a shit.

00:38:50.914 --> 00:38:53.759
TALIESIN: You don't give a shit and that's fine,
that's PacMan life.

00:38:53.759 --> 00:38:58.309
LAURA: Oh shit. Two successes, one fail.

00:38:58.309 --> 00:39:02.605
TALIESIN: One one? Okay.

00:39:02.605 --> 00:39:03.693
TRAVIS: Two successes.

00:39:03.693 --> 00:39:04.795
TALIESIN: Was it a blood one? Okay.

00:39:04.795 --> 00:39:05.958
TRAVIS: Two successes, no failures.

00:39:05.958 --> 00:39:12.264
TALIESIN: You've been paying some attention,
trying to figure out your direction and where

00:39:12.264 --> 00:39:16.801
you're going and how long you've been walking. You
are starting to go under Mulholland.

00:39:16.801 --> 00:39:18.163
TRAVIS: Whoa.

00:39:18.163 --> 00:39:20.031
SAM: Under Mulholland?

00:39:20.031 --> 00:39:24.504
TALIESIN: You're heading towards the Hills. You're
getting awful close to it. It's been a couple

00:39:24.504 --> 00:39:31.397
miles you've been walking underneath this
underground tunnel, this really old tunnel.

00:39:31.397 --> 00:39:36.415
TRAVIS: Is there any pavers or anything in this
tunnel or does it still look like it was burrowed?

00:39:36.415 --> 00:39:40.275
Like rudimenti-larily.

00:39:40.275 --> 00:39:47.010
TALIESIN: Since you had a decent perception: it's
burrowed, but there's some very specific scratch

00:39:47.010 --> 00:39:54.031
marks since you've gotten a little further on.
There starts to be some rudimentary, like almost a

00:39:54.031 --> 00:39:58.545
hobo code is what I would call it? There's little
symbols that have been left that obviously mean

00:39:58.545 --> 00:40:03.850
something but you don't know what they mean.
Somebody's been in here.

00:40:03.850 --> 00:40:07.705
TRAVIS: We're making pretty good distance, I think
we're close to Mullholland.

00:40:07.705 --> 00:40:09.267
LAURA: Really?

00:40:09.267 --> 00:40:10.419
SAM: That's far.

00:40:10.419 --> 00:40:11.765
LAURA: That's really far.

00:40:11.765 --> 00:40:17.399
LIAM: Listen, when I was a teenager in New Jersey,
my first job was working for the Department of

00:40:17.399 --> 00:40:25.723
Public Works, no joke, and we cleaned up after
homeless folk, okay. Can I try and read the hobo code?

00:40:25.723 --> 00:40:27.683
TALIESIN: You can.

00:40:27.683 --> 00:40:29.402
SAM: You're proficient in hobo?

00:40:29.402 --> 00:40:30.410
LIAM: Yeah.

00:40:30.410 --> 00:40:32.216
TALIESIN: I'll give that intelligence academics.

00:40:32.216 --> 00:40:35.799
LIAM: Okay. Ooh! Okay.

00:40:35.799 --> 00:40:38.458
SAM: This marking means "can of beans."

00:40:38.458 --> 00:40:46.468
LIAM: Yeah, we cleaned up and once I found some
nasty old mattresses with some magazines. Some

00:40:46.468 --> 00:40:47.938
smelly things.

00:40:47.938 --> 00:40:50.525
TALIESIN: I was not expecting someone to go for
the hobo code.

00:40:50.525 --> 00:40:53.345
LIAM: Right underneath Hamilton Park.

00:40:53.345 --> 00:40:57.680
SAM: What if these are taggers?

00:40:57.680 --> 00:40:59.059
LIAM: Oh, no.

00:40:59.059 --> 00:41:00.281
TRAVIS: Taggers?

00:41:00.281 --> 00:41:01.306
SAM: Taggers.

00:41:01.306 --> 00:41:06.569
LIAM: One success. Only one success and one
failure on a blood die.

00:41:06.569 --> 00:41:08.648
LAURA: Well, but, no-- oh, that's a five.

00:41:08.648 --> 00:41:09.878
LIAM: I didn't roll that.

00:41:09.878 --> 00:41:14.500
TALIESIN: There are worse things in the world than
one failure on a blood die. Two failures on a

00:41:14.500 --> 00:41:15.984
blood die is a problem.

00:41:15.984 --> 00:41:18.719
LIAM: Yeah. Like dirty magazines on a mattress,
that's worse.

00:41:18.719 --> 00:41:23.806
TALIESIN: You end up at the back of the group,
because you're staring at this stuff, and it's not

00:41:23.806 --> 00:41:26.667
ringing a bell at all. This is weird.

00:41:26.667 --> 00:41:27.974
LIAM: It is taking me home, though.

00:41:27.974 --> 00:41:34.099
TALIESIN: Yeah, you're drifting a little bit. I
mean, you're a little cloudy, you're not all there.

00:41:34.099 --> 00:41:36.524
LIAM: It's good, I'm going to leave it behind,
because I've got a new future now.

00:41:36.524 --> 00:41:39.746
SAM: What's our endgame here? We've been walking
for miles.

00:41:39.746 --> 00:41:43.773
TRAVIS: Well, we can't go back the way we came,
we've got to find a way out, at least.

00:41:43.773 --> 00:41:51.151
SAM: Are there any other tunnels? Or any other
peeks up into the daylight, or up top?

00:41:51.151 --> 00:41:56.683
TALIESIN: Just the glow of the algae. Travis, roll
just perception.

00:41:56.683 --> 00:42:03.239
TRAVIS: Okay, just perception. That is a crit. Two
tens.

00:42:03.239 --> 00:42:12.943
TALIESIN: There is something right above. There is
a creature.

00:42:12.943 --> 00:42:15.134
TRAVIS: In the tunnel with us?

00:42:15.134 --> 00:42:17.894
TALIESIN: In the tunnel with you, directly above
you.

00:42:17.894 --> 00:42:20.044
LIAM: Why do you look like that? What's wrong with
you?

00:42:20.044 --> 00:42:22.502
SAM: What's up, Travis?

00:42:22.502 --> 00:42:30.270
TALIESIN: It's very thin, it's the same color as
the walls, it's almost camouflaged perfectly, and

00:42:30.270 --> 00:42:33.646
it's vaguely reptilian.

00:42:33.646 --> 00:42:39.930
TRAVIS: There's-- there is-- Don't look up,
there's--

00:42:39.930 --> 00:42:42.839
SAM: Speak in code, speak in pig latin.

00:42:42.839 --> 00:42:49.601
TRAVIS: (incoherent mumbling) There's something
above us, and it's reptilian looking.

00:42:49.601 --> 00:42:51.935
LAURA: I look up.

00:42:51.935 --> 00:42:53.170
TALIESIN: You look up?

00:42:53.170 --> 00:42:54.049
LAURA: Yeah.

00:42:54.049 --> 00:42:55.248
LIAM: I'm backing away.

00:42:55.248 --> 00:42:56.751
SAM: I'm drawing my XLR whip.

00:42:56.751 --> 00:43:02.336
TALIESIN: It goes scurrying at high speed when you
look up.

00:43:02.336 --> 00:43:04.907
LAURA: Forward or back?

00:43:04.907 --> 00:43:09.400
TALIESIN: Back from the direction you came. It
darts back there.

00:43:09.400 --> 00:43:10.753
SAM: I'm going.

00:43:10.753 --> 00:43:11.731
TALIESIN: You're going for it?

00:43:11.731 --> 00:43:13.221
SAM: Yes, I take off after it.

00:43:13.221 --> 00:43:14.878
TALIESIN: What level of Celerity are you?

00:43:14.878 --> 00:43:16.452
LAURA: What is it?

00:43:16.452 --> 00:43:17.749
TALIESIN: Some sort of lizard.

00:43:17.749 --> 00:43:19.531
LAURA: A lizard? Like a person lizard?

00:43:19.531 --> 00:43:21.046
TALIESIN: Something lizardy.

00:43:21.046 --> 00:43:23.707
SAM: It says you are capable of an incredibly fast
response time.

00:43:23.707 --> 00:43:25.829
TALIESIN: So, you're using Celerity two, right?

00:43:25.829 --> 00:43:27.279
SAM: I don't know, what does that mean?

00:43:27.279 --> 00:43:28.462
TRAVIS: Yeah, Celerity.

00:43:28.462 --> 00:43:33.502
TALIESIN: Celerity two. I'm looking at the wrong
thing, here we go. I'm trying to be good about this.

00:43:33.502 --> 00:43:36.601
SAM: May use your dodge skill against firearms,
you don't suffer penalties--

00:43:36.601 --> 00:43:40.045
TALIESIN: So, you can actually climb vertical
surfaces with Celerity Two.

00:43:40.045 --> 00:43:45.952
SAM: I have Grace that makes me climb any vertical
surface no matter how slippery or flimsy.

00:43:45.952 --> 00:43:48.257
TALIESIN: Make a hunger roll. Roll a d10.

00:43:48.257 --> 00:43:49.856
SAM: Just 1d10?

00:43:49.856 --> 00:43:51.064
TALIESIN: Just 1d10.

00:43:51.064 --> 00:43:52.125
SAM: One.

00:43:52.125 --> 00:43:55.970
TALIESIN: Okay, burn a hunger, so you're about to
get--

00:43:55.970 --> 00:44:00.677
SAM: No, I have plenty, you don't need to give me
any more, I've got five over here.

00:44:00.677 --> 00:44:03.575
TALIESIN: Do you have five? I thought 
you weren't hungry at all?

00:44:03.575 --> 00:44:06.616
SAM: I'm just not giving them back to you when I'm
done because that's silly.

00:44:06.616 --> 00:44:09.532
TALIESIN: Okay, well, fine. I marked them all up
and made them all pretty for this.

00:44:09.532 --> 00:44:12.044
SAM: What do I? Do I roll one of these?

00:44:12.044 --> 00:44:16.380
TALIESIN: Well you did, and you just got an extra
one, so you're now at one hunger and you're

00:44:16.380 --> 00:44:18.497
peckish.

00:44:18.497 --> 00:44:21.403
SAM: But I don't catch him, or what?

00:44:21.403 --> 00:44:22.748
TALIESIN: You do catch him.

00:44:22.748 --> 00:44:23.511
SAM: Oh.

00:44:23.511 --> 00:44:31.516
TALIESIN: You are fast and you climb up the wall
and you come in contact with a humanoid lizard,

00:44:31.516 --> 00:44:38.879
who turns, looks at you with big, gold eyes, and
(hissing screech).

00:44:38.879 --> 00:44:42.423
SAM: I will try to grapple him.

00:44:42.423 --> 00:44:43.864
TALIESIN: You can do that.

00:44:43.864 --> 00:44:52.438
SAM: With my mic cable, I'm going to try and wrap
it around his snout, so he can't open his snout.

00:44:52.438 --> 00:44:54.678
TALIESIN: Here we are, roll strength brawl.

00:44:54.678 --> 00:44:58.577
SAM: Strength brawl, that's my forte. Oh, boy.

00:44:58.577 --> 00:45:01.383
LIAM: There will be brawl.

00:45:01.383 --> 00:45:04.213
SAM: Three successes.

00:45:04.213 --> 00:45:16.943
TALIESIN: Three successes? Yep, you grab onto a
leg and you've got a flailing angry lizard person

00:45:16.943 --> 00:45:18.592
currently grappled.

00:45:18.592 --> 00:45:20.547
TRAVIS: We're all giving chase, we're trying to
catch up.

00:45:20.547 --> 00:45:22.847
SAM: I'm trying to hog tie him while I say: get
over here! I need help!

00:45:22.847 --> 00:45:26.988
TALIESIN: (hissing) "Let go! Let go!"

00:45:26.988 --> 00:45:28.734
SAM: Oh! He talks!

00:45:28.734 --> 00:45:30.967
LAURA: (gasping) Oh my god, what is it? Can we eat
it?

00:45:30.967 --> 00:45:35.319
TALIESIN: You turn so quick, god.

00:45:35.319 --> 00:45:38.370
SAM: I think we like warm blood, we like mammals.

00:45:38.370 --> 00:45:39.924
LAURA: Oh.

00:45:39.924 --> 00:45:41.678
LIAM: I'm following, too, but not that fast.

00:45:41.678 --> 00:45:45.683
SAM: I'm going to try to tie him more secure.

00:45:45.683 --> 00:45:49.559
TALIESIN: Just for fun, give me one more strength
brawl.

00:45:49.559 --> 00:45:52.021
LAURA, LIAM, and TRAVIS: Ooh.

00:45:52.021 --> 00:45:53.440
SAM: Two successes, one fail.

00:45:53.440 --> 00:45:55.680
TALIESIN: Two successes, one fail? Is the fail on
the red?

00:45:55.680 --> 00:45:56.824
SAM: Yes, it's a blood die.

00:45:56.824 --> 00:45:58.356
TALIESIN: How do you keep doing that? Oh, is it a
fail or a one?

00:45:58.356 --> 00:45:59.310
SAM: It's a one.

00:45:59.310 --> 00:46:00.496
TALIESIN: It's a one, okay.

00:46:00.496 --> 00:46:01.613
TRAVIS: That means you get another--

00:46:01.613 --> 00:46:08.101
TALIESIN: No, that means I can maybe-- you were
very lucky. Yep, he's not doing well with you.

00:46:08.101 --> 00:46:10.530
SAM: Hog tying him. I went to a rodeo once.

00:46:10.530 --> 00:46:14.316
TRAVIS: I'm pretty fast, could I get there and try
and help?

00:46:14.316 --> 00:46:19.928
TALIESIN: How long has it been? It's been two--
yeah, you're there by then. He didn't get very

00:46:19.928 --> 00:46:21.792
far. Celerity is mean.

00:46:21.792 --> 00:46:25.812
TRAVIS: What the fuck is that thing?!

00:46:25.812 --> 00:46:27.366
SAM: I don't know, it talks, who are you, what are
you?

00:46:27.366 --> 00:46:29.662
TALIESIN: (hissing monster noises) "Let go!"

00:46:29.662 --> 00:46:32.445
SAM: We'll unhand you if you tell us who and what
you are.

00:46:32.445 --> 00:46:39.561
TALIESIN: "My name is Lock. This is &lt;i&gt;my&lt;/i&gt; tunnel.
No vampires!"

00:46:39.561 --> 00:46:41.999
LAURA: Oh shit.

00:46:41.999 --> 00:46:43.296
TRAVIS: His name's Slock?

00:46:43.296 --> 00:46:44.591
SAM: Or lock. Or rock.

00:46:44.591 --> 00:46:46.152
TALIESIN: "Lock."

00:46:46.152 --> 00:46:49.060
LIAM: You guys doing okay down there?

00:46:49.060 --> 00:46:50.798
SAM: No?

00:46:50.798 --> 00:46:52.716
LAURA: Stay back Liam, it's too dangerous.

00:46:52.716 --> 00:46:53.960
LIAM: Good call.

00:46:53.960 --> 00:47:00.185
SAM: This is your tunnel? We just became vampires
an hour ago.

00:47:00.185 --> 00:47:04.664
TALIESIN: (hissing) "Vampires? Two weeks in my
tunnel, two weeks!"

00:47:04.664 --> 00:47:07.123
LAURA: How long have you been here?

00:47:07.123 --> 00:47:11.940
TALIESIN: "We've always been here."

00:47:11.940 --> 00:47:13.876
SAM: Oh god.

00:47:13.876 --> 00:47:16.002
LAURA: They're the lizard people of Los Angeles!

00:47:16.002 --> 00:47:19.391
SAM: I knew they were true!

00:47:19.391 --> 00:47:22.028
TALIESIN: I am genuinely amazed that you actually
know that there are lizard people beneath the--

00:47:22.028 --> 00:47:24.923
TRAVIS: Yes! Of course, man. The rest are in DC.

00:47:24.923 --> 00:47:31.307
TALIESIN: Goddamn it. That is some deep LA myth,
man. Okay.

00:47:31.307 --> 00:47:39.715
TRAVIS: We want to let you go, we don't mean you
any direct harm, but we need to know how to get

00:47:39.715 --> 00:47:41.151
out of this tunnel.

00:47:41.151 --> 00:47:43.498
SAM: How long does the tunnel go? Where can we
find an exit?

00:47:43.498 --> 00:47:45.098
LAURA: How can we not be vampires anymore?

00:47:45.098 --> 00:47:49.667
TRAVIS: We're going to eat him. "I don't want to
be a vampire." We're going to eat him.

00:47:49.667 --> 00:47:53.337
TALIESIN: "What's wrong with you people?"

00:47:53.337 --> 00:47:59.760
SAM: We're new at this. You've been here for what,
a millennia or something? We've been vampires for

00:47:59.760 --> 00:48:01.709
I guess two weeks, right?

00:48:01.709 --> 00:48:03.124
LAURA: Ish.

00:48:03.124 --> 00:48:12.551
TALIESIN: "I twice have been beneath cities since
its inception. For thousands of years we have

00:48:12.551 --> 00:48:15.642
"lived-- You are supposed to know this."

00:48:15.642 --> 00:48:17.992
LAURA: We don't know anything.

00:48:17.992 --> 00:48:19.949
TALIESIN: "We had an arrangement with you."

00:48:19.949 --> 00:48:26.883
TRAVIS: We're literally hours into this thing, we
don't mean any offense.

00:48:26.883 --> 00:48:34.303
SAM: No one guided us through the change. We had
no bar mitzvah or whatever you call it.

00:48:34.303 --> 00:48:37.687
TALIESIN: "You people are way too pitiful to be
vampires."

00:48:37.687 --> 00:48:39.585
TRAVIS: Okay, hold it, take it easy.

00:48:39.585 --> 00:48:44.749
SAM: We have powers, all right? Look at this. And
I walk up around the tunnel, like in a

00:48:44.749 --> 00:48:46.455
loop-de-loop.

00:48:46.455 --> 00:48:48.249
TALIESIN: "I can do that. I don't really--"

00:48:48.249 --> 00:48:49.516
SAM: Yeah, but I'm not a lizard.

00:48:49.516 --> 00:48:52.087
LAURA: Yeah, but what about this?

00:48:52.087 --> 00:48:54.170
TALIESIN: That doesn't work if we're actually
watching you, you know that right?

00:48:54.170 --> 00:48:55.539
LAURA: Just kidding!

00:48:55.539 --> 00:48:56.935
TALIESIN: It's like you got fuzzy for a second.

00:48:56.935 --> 00:49:03.815
LIAM: I've been listening in and I come in and say:
What about this? And I use Presence Awe on him.

00:49:03.815 --> 00:49:05.128
TALIESIN: Are you going to try Presence Awe?

00:49:05.128 --> 00:49:06.278
LIAM: Sure am.

00:49:06.278 --> 00:49:07.503
TALIESIN: I'm going to double check my--

00:49:07.503 --> 00:49:09.478
LIAM: What do I roll? Charisma plus persuasion is
all it says.

00:49:09.478 --> 00:49:11.618
TALIESIN: So give me a roll of 1d10.

00:49:11.618 --> 00:49:13.643
LIAM: All right. Well, charisma plus persuasion?

00:49:13.643 --> 00:49:15.940
TALIESIN: Well first give me a hunger roll since
I'm learning how to--

00:49:15.940 --> 00:49:17.274
LIAM: Ooh, I failed it.

00:49:17.274 --> 00:49:18.807
TALIESIN: You got a one?

00:49:18.807 --> 00:49:20.581
LIAM: Wow, there are a lot of failures tonight.
Yeah.

00:49:20.581 --> 00:49:23.911
TALIESIN: All right, you're getting an extra
hunger. But now do your charisma plus persuasion.

00:49:23.911 --> 00:49:38.023
Where's my lizard?

00:49:38.023 --> 00:49:43.150
LIAM: Two successes, and one failure on a blood
die. A lot of failures on a fucking blood die.

00:49:43.150 --> 00:49:45.717
TALIESIN: My god, oh, what, nope.

00:49:45.717 --> 00:49:47.093
TRAVIS: You're rolling crap tonight.

00:49:47.093 --> 00:49:53.406
TALIESIN: Yeah, you're not alone. Yeah, Lock's
looking at you.

00:49:53.406 --> 00:49:54.921
LIAM: Yeah?

00:49:54.921 --> 00:50:00.147
TALIESIN: "You look familiar. I don't know why.
Hmm."

00:50:00.147 --> 00:50:03.715
LIAM: Do you work in the business?

00:50:03.715 --> 00:50:06.494
SAM: He's an agent at UTA.

00:50:06.494 --> 00:50:12.752
TALIESIN: Gets about that much sun. "And-- hmm."

00:50:12.752 --> 00:50:17.228
LIAM: Bottom line, we don't mean you any harm, I
mean, we're hungry, but you're not really our--

00:50:17.228 --> 00:50:19.187
TALIESIN: "I wouldn't recommend it."

00:50:19.187 --> 00:50:20.790
LIAM: You're not our diet.

00:50:20.790 --> 00:50:21.970
LAURA: Yeah.

00:50:21.970 --> 00:50:25.111
SAM: If I untie you, do you promise not to run
away?

00:50:25.111 --> 00:50:26.569
LAURA: Can you help us?

00:50:26.569 --> 00:50:31.380
TRAVIS: We'd be most grateful.

00:50:31.380 --> 00:50:33.085
LIAM: Just the basics.

00:50:33.085 --> 00:50:38.026
TALIESIN: "I can bring you to someone you can talk
to."

00:50:38.026 --> 00:50:41.461
LAURA: Are they going to kill us?

00:50:41.461 --> 00:50:42.898
TRAVIS: Like you?

00:50:42.898 --> 00:50:47.215
LAURA: "I don't know. Yes, like me. We'll see."

00:50:47.215 --> 00:50:52.319
LIAM: If you take the vampire teeth out.

00:50:52.319 --> 00:50:55.768
TALIESIN: I blame you two, you've put it in my
head!

00:50:55.768 --> 00:50:57.527
TRAVIS: I think it's the best we can do.

00:50:57.527 --> 00:50:59.179
LAURA: Yeah. Let's do it.

00:50:59.179 --> 00:51:05.202
SAM: I will untie the beast. Is he more
crocodile?

00:51:05.202 --> 00:51:16.273
TALIESIN: He's got a flattened face and very big
gold eyes and sharp shark teeth in the mouth. It's

00:51:16.273 --> 00:51:19.905
a very big chop. But he's thin and smaller.

00:51:19.905 --> 00:51:23.178
LAURA: Before we release you, pinky swear that
you're going to help us.

00:51:23.178 --> 00:51:26.493
TALIESIN: Don't know if he has pinkies. Well,
yeah, he could put something out, put a claw.

00:51:26.493 --> 00:51:29.736
LAURA: Can I try to manipulate him or persuade him
or something?

00:51:29.736 --> 00:51:34.369
TALIESIN: You can. Do you want to do charisma or
manipulation?

00:51:34.369 --> 00:51:36.541
LIAM: Taliesin, did my glamor work?

00:51:36.541 --> 00:51:38.589
TALIESIN: You don't know.

00:51:38.589 --> 00:51:40.095
LIAM: Don't know. All right.

00:51:40.095 --> 00:51:42.534
LAURA: I'm not as good at it as Vex is.

00:51:42.534 --> 00:51:44.693
TALIESIN: I'm going to give you charisma
persuasion.

00:51:44.693 --> 00:51:46.493
TRAVIS: Watch where you point that thing.

00:51:46.493 --> 00:51:48.736
TALIESIN: Stamina.

00:51:48.736 --> 00:51:51.334
LAURA: Stamina!

00:51:51.334 --> 00:51:57.891
TALIESIN: Hashtag Stanima. They made us character
sheets with "stanima" on them.

00:51:57.891 --> 00:51:59.972
LAURA: Three successes.

00:51:59.972 --> 00:52:05.820
TALIESIN: "I know this is weird, but I swear we've
met."

00:52:05.820 --> 00:52:07.453
LAURA: You seem really familiar.

00:52:07.453 --> 00:52:08.712
TALIESIN: "You look very familiar."

00:52:08.712 --> 00:52:12.584
LAURA: Yeah! Do you ever go to Jinky's?

00:52:12.584 --> 00:52:15.551
TALIESIN: "No."

00:52:15.551 --> 00:52:22.386
LIAM: You're not Nerdist. I mostly know Geek &amp;
Sundry.

00:52:22.386 --> 00:52:27.410
TALIESIN: Might have been Smart Girls, to be fair
to you. You'd never know if there were lizard people

00:52:27.410 --> 00:52:28.556
working.

00:52:28.556 --> 00:52:31.309
LAURA: I feel like we know him; let's release him
for sure.

00:52:31.309 --> 00:52:37.810
LIAM: Before we do: we're idiots, right? We're
brand new. Obviously, there's been some sort of

00:52:37.810 --> 00:52:42.219
peace between above and below, and we just want to
facilitate that, right?

00:52:42.219 --> 00:52:46.745
TALIESIN: "That seems fair, yes."

00:52:46.745 --> 00:52:51.368
SAM: He's been released. I release him.

00:52:51.368 --> 00:52:58.228
TALIESIN: "Come. I'll take you to the chamber."

00:52:58.228 --> 00:53:00.788
TRAVIS: Who will we be meeting?

00:53:00.788 --> 00:53:09.788
TALIESIN: "Well, that depends. We'll see." You're
going to follow him further down?

00:53:09.788 --> 00:53:15.810
TRAVIS: Sure. As we're walking from behind, can I
use my Aura Perception to see what his true

00:53:15.810 --> 00:53:18.168
motives are as he's leading us to this chamber?

00:53:18.168 --> 00:53:26.699
TALIESIN: Sure. Roll a blood die. Just one die.

00:53:26.699 --> 00:53:29.257
TRAVIS: Fuck!

00:53:29.257 --> 00:53:31.032
TALIESIN: You rolled a one, didn't you?

00:53:31.032 --> 00:53:32.386
TRAVIS: Yeah, a red one.

00:53:32.386 --> 00:53:34.212
TALIESIN: You get another hunger. What are you at
now?

00:53:34.212 --> 00:53:38.934
TRAVIS: I was at three, down from the four from my
wife rat! Now I'm back up to four.

00:53:38.934 --> 00:53:44.758
TALIESIN: Is that a proper die? Did I give you one
with an x? It doesn't matter. You know if you rolled

00:53:44.758 --> 00:53:54.123
a one. Now you can roll your check for that. That
was to see if you get hungrier from using it.

00:53:54.123 --> 00:53:59.559
SAM: In real life, or as a vampire?

00:53:59.559 --> 00:54:02.137
LAURA: I know! Can we cut that cake?

00:54:02.137 --> 00:54:08.189
TRAVIS: That's one blood one and three successes.

00:54:08.189 --> 00:54:16.359
TALIESIN: One blood failure? It's going to take
you a little while to figure it out, but he seems

00:54:16.359 --> 00:54:21.527
frustrated. You get a frustrated vibe from his
aura.

00:54:21.527 --> 00:54:23.628
TRAVIS: But not the "I'm leading them into a
trap?"

00:54:23.628 --> 00:54:30.572
TALIESIN: There's nothing duplicitous yet. If
anything, you're getting a little activity up here

00:54:30.572 --> 00:54:37.517
like he's wracking his brain trying to figure out
what is going on. He seems just as confounded by

00:54:37.517 --> 00:54:47.018
this, perhaps. You go down a little further
through this cave until you come into a huge

00:54:47.018 --> 00:54:52.072
clearing that is-- that was amazing!

00:54:52.072 --> 00:54:53.975
TRAVIS: I whip my hair back and forth!

00:54:53.975 --> 00:54:57.087
LIAM: It's hot in here, so if you could keep doing
that.

00:54:57.087 --> 00:55:01.609
TALIESIN: At home, if you want to simulate the
studio right, pump that heat up to about 100

00:55:01.609 --> 00:55:11.980
degrees. It's great. There's a big interior cavern
that you seem to be under. You're probably pretty

00:55:11.980 --> 00:55:18.084
deep now. We're probably deeper than the subway
tunnels. Probably, just barely on the other side

00:55:18.084 --> 00:55:26.735
or a little further past Mulholland, maybe a
little deeper. And you come into these two giant

00:55:26.735 --> 00:55:34.380
stone lions that have started to decay and crumble
and there's a big, beautiful stone sign that is

00:55:34.380 --> 00:55:41.331
decaying, falling apart and covered with this
strange luminescent moss and it says Luna Park.

00:55:41.331 --> 00:55:44.786
TRAVIS: Probably not the restaurant.

00:55:44.786 --> 00:55:46.575
LAURA: Oh yeah! I was thinking of the restaurant.

00:55:46.575 --> 00:55:49.803
TALIESIN: You &lt;i&gt;were&lt;/i&gt; thinking of the restaurant.
How do you know the restaurant? I'm so impressed

00:55:49.803 --> 00:55:50.580
by you.

00:55:50.580 --> 00:55:52.478
LAURA: We love that place. It's so good.

00:55:52.478 --> 00:56:00.719
TALIESIN: As you come in, you pass through these
arches and there's this strange what can only be

00:56:00.719 --> 00:56:10.527
described as a supervillain's lair. This is an
abandoned theme park. Underground.

00:56:10.527 --> 00:56:12.772
LAURA: What?! That's creepy!

00:56:12.772 --> 00:56:20.804
TALIESIN: There's a lake in front of you with a
beautiful boardwalk that has crumbled into

00:56:20.804 --> 00:56:28.386
disrepair. There's a strange pyramid volcano in
the distance. There's a strange little

00:56:28.386 --> 00:56:34.258
amphitheatre to the left that looks like an
ancient Roman colosseum, odd gardens with strange

00:56:34.258 --> 00:56:41.069
luminous plants growing. If you peek in the back,
you can see the beginning of cages, perhaps for

00:56:41.069 --> 00:56:42.495
animals.

00:56:42.495 --> 00:56:44.627
LIAM: How big are we talking? Like an NFL
stadium?

00:56:44.627 --> 00:56:48.751
TALIESIN: Slightly less than. About half a
stadium.

00:56:48.751 --> 00:56:50.769
SAM: Do you know what the size and shape is,
Liam?

00:56:50.769 --> 00:56:52.090
LIAM: I was just in one.

00:56:52.090 --> 00:56:55.931
TALIESIN: I'll tell you what, not that we don't
have, but if you want to see it. You can get a

00:56:55.931 --> 00:56:57.599
notion of it.

00:56:57.599 --> 00:56:59.968
LAURA: Damn, this is big!

00:56:59.968 --> 00:57:01.323
TALIESIN: It's big.

00:57:01.323 --> 00:57:02.966
LAURA: Which direction did we enter from?

00:57:02.966 --> 00:57:04.035
TALIESIN: From the bottom.

00:57:04.035 --> 00:57:05.948
LAURA; The main entrance. Wow.

00:57:05.948 --> 00:57:11.747
TALIESIN: I will, at some point, post that on the
internet so that people can see.

00:57:11.747 --> 00:57:18.859
LAURA: Jeez Louise. That's big and intricate. What
is his name?

00:57:18.859 --> 00:57:19.802
TALIESIN: Lock.

00:57:19.802 --> 00:57:21.657
LAURA: Lock. What is Lock doing right now?

00:57:21.657 --> 00:57:28.514
TALIESIN: He is guiding you past the lake to a
strange--

00:57:28.514 --> 00:57:30.106
SAM: Is this the old zoo?

00:57:30.106 --> 00:57:31.225
TALIESIN: No.

00:57:31.225 --> 00:57:32.623
LAURA: This is still underground?

00:57:32.623 --> 00:57:38.258
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm. I'll tell you about this at the
break and then I'll tell you where that map came

00:57:38.258 --> 00:57:43.169
from. It's fascinating. This is my other hobby
that I'm bringing into this game.

00:57:43.169 --> 00:57:46.839
SAM: Collecting old lizard maps of LA?

00:57:46.839 --> 00:57:55.151
TRAVIS: See, Taliesin's so immortal, he remembers
the civilizations that preceded--

00:57:55.151 --> 00:58:01.443
TALIESIN: 5000 years ago. 5000 years is how long
lizard people have been in Los Angeles. Man. No, I

00:58:01.443 --> 00:58:08.641
got shit. As he brings you past the lake and he
brings you past the amphitheatre and the strange

00:58:08.641 --> 00:58:16.142
gardens with these strange luminous lilies and
these orchids that are growing that never seen

00:58:16.142 --> 00:58:28.351
sunlight, you come to this weird old Victorian
house that's obviously a facade into a basic black

00:58:28.351 --> 00:58:32.063
box, like in an amusement park. And above it, it
says "The House of Trouble."

00:58:32.063 --> 00:58:33.504
SAM: Treble?

00:58:33.504 --> 00:58:35.071
TALIESIN: The House of Trouble.

00:58:35.071 --> 00:58:36.508
SAM: There's music in there.

00:58:36.508 --> 00:58:41.630
TALIESIN: And he is turning up-- not of treble.
It's not the House of Treble. The House of

00:58:41.630 --> 00:58:42.714
Trouble, not treble.

00:58:42.714 --> 00:58:45.189
SAM: I'm pretty sure you said "treble" twice.

00:58:45.189 --> 00:58:52.345
TALIESIN: Well, then you're going to be very
disappointed when you go in. And he gestures for

00:58:52.345 --> 00:58:53.937
you to enter.

00:58:53.937 --> 00:58:58.408
LAURA: Are you going to come in with 
us? Is it scary?

00:58:58.482 --> 00:59:00.385
SAM: No, there's music! It's fine.

00:59:00.385 --> 00:59:02.472
LIAM: Are you not allowed in there, Lock?

00:59:02.472 --> 00:59:07.984
TALIESIN: "Inside will be those who know
what to do with the four of you."

00:59:07.984 --> 00:59:11.904
SAM: Without a proper introduction, how will we
know who we're talking to? We really need you in

00:59:11.904 --> 00:59:13.271
there with us.

00:59:13.271 --> 00:59:14.603
TALIESIN: "I'll follow."

00:59:14.603 --> 00:59:16.136
TRAVIS: Fair enough.

00:59:16.136 --> 00:59:18.390
SAM: Who should go in first?

00:59:18.390 --> 00:59:19.404
TRAVIS: I'll go in.

00:59:19.404 --> 00:59:20.357
SAM: Why?

00:59:20.357 --> 00:59:21.750
LAURA: Because he's big and strong!

00:59:21.750 --> 00:59:26.712
SAM: We choose leaders based on size? It should
be on intelligence.

00:59:26.712 --> 00:59:29.689
LAURA: So Travis goes first, then?

00:59:29.689 --> 00:59:32.174
SAM: Yes. Absolutely. But not because he's
strong.

00:59:32.174 --> 00:59:36.015
TRAVIS: What's your intelligence rating? Three and
mine's four. So yeah, I'll do that.

00:59:36.015 --> 00:59:38.069
LAURA: But you know what? Mine is four as well.

00:59:38.069 --> 00:59:39.354
LIAM: Same.

00:59:39.354 --> 00:59:42.527
SAM: I'm the dumbest one?! Thanks, Taliesin.

00:59:42.527 --> 00:59:44.516
LIAM: Taliesin's brother.

00:59:44.516 --> 00:59:48.268
TALIESIN: My brother! Thank you, Alex Jaffe for
making a judgment call there.

00:59:48.268 --> 00:59:51.364
SAM: Out of those guys, I think Sam's probably the
dummy.

00:59:51.364 --> 00:59:56.579
TALIESIN: You know, maybe if you had gone to
Burning Man, he would have a better opinion of you.

00:59:56.579 --> 00:59:58.896
TRAVIS: Is this Tibet's doing?

00:59:58.896 --> 01:00:00.215
TALIESIN: No, it's Alex.

01:00:00.215 --> 01:00:02.268
TRAVIS: Oh, it's okay. Okay, great.

01:00:02.268 --> 01:00:04.361
TALIESIN: Both of my brothers are now dipping
their head in panic.

01:00:04.395 --> 01:00:07.342
TRAVIS: Laura and I will co-lead this venture into
the chamber.

01:00:07.342 --> 01:00:08.862
LAURA: Liam, you stay back. You have to be safe.

01:00:08.862 --> 01:00:11.847
LIAM: Are you sure? Okay. If you insist.

01:00:11.847 --> 01:00:13.499
TRAVIS: Yeah, I think that's actually a good
idea.

01:00:13.499 --> 01:00:14.700
LIAM: Only if you insist.

01:00:14.700 --> 01:00:16.973
TRAVIS: Yeah, in fact, just stay behind Sam.

01:00:16.973 --> 01:00:19.788
LIAM: My normal place.

01:00:19.788 --> 01:00:22.308
TALIESIN: That's a smart place to be.

01:00:22.308 --> 01:00:24.090
SAM: Duh, that sounds good.

01:00:24.090 --> 01:00:28.425
TALIESIN: You're not taking that three very well,
are you?

01:00:28.425 --> 01:00:30.770
SAM: Going to the big house.

01:00:30.770 --> 01:00:43.595
TALIESIN: Really not taking that three well. Good
to remember. So sorry. As I check my notes, thank

01:00:43.595 --> 01:00:57.902
you. As you enter what appears to have once been
perhaps some strange boat ride, some weird tunnel

01:00:57.902 --> 01:01:04.243
of love ride where you have boats that go through
some strange cave, has been drained. And you step

01:01:04.243 --> 01:01:08.891
into the cavern and you walk into the back. And as
you curl around into the main amphitheater of the

01:01:08.891 --> 01:01:23.365
ride, it is blindingly plated with gold. There is
ancient, beautiful, almost a little bit of Mayan,

01:01:23.365 --> 01:01:33.449
a little bit of North American Hopi Indian design
decked through this room. It is gleaming with a

01:01:33.449 --> 01:01:42.481
gold glow from all of the plates that have been
intricately set into this room from the throne

01:01:42.481 --> 01:01:49.671
that has been set up in the center to the benches
that have been placed around like a bit of an

01:01:49.671 --> 01:01:55.867
observation court, like a surgical observation.
You're sitting in a pit in a theater, thank you.

01:01:55.867 --> 01:02:00.013
LAURA: Does it look like it was all done at the
same time, or has it been added over time?

01:02:00.013 --> 01:02:06.754
TALIESIN: It's all too old to tell. It's like
walking into a temple. It's hard to tell what came

01:02:06.754 --> 01:02:08.075
first and what didn't.

01:02:08.075 --> 01:02:09.552
LIAM: How big is the house? How many seats?

01:02:09.552 --> 01:02:12.792
TALIESIN: About 50.

01:02:12.792 --> 01:02:14.992
LAURA: So it's like a surgical theater.

01:02:14.992 --> 01:02:17.967
TALIESIN: It's like a surgical theater, you're
going to be at the bottom, and then there are rows

01:02:17.967 --> 01:02:22.557
of people at the top. And there's not a ton of
people, if you can call them people, there.

01:02:22.557 --> 01:02:29.634
There's about 20 lizard men gathered around,
taking a look.

01:02:29.634 --> 01:02:31.515
LIAM: Specifically lizard &lt;i&gt;men&lt;/i&gt;?

01:02:31.515 --> 01:02:37.775
TALIESIN: You probably can't tell gender yet. And
I wouldn't even necessarily know how one would

01:02:37.775 --> 01:02:40.171
tell gender off the top of my head.

01:02:40.171 --> 01:02:41.693
SAM: I've got some ideas.

01:02:41.693 --> 01:02:52.548
TALIESIN: I knew you would. There is obviously a
leader. Lock is coming in from the back and is

01:02:52.548 --> 01:02:57.771
joined by two or three others who are not
pressuring you inside but definitely making

01:02:57.771 --> 01:03:06.108
sure you're not about to run. As you enter and
stand in the center of the theater, Lock turns to

01:03:06.108 --> 01:03:19.916
the lizard creature in the largest, most ornate
gold chair, and turns and says, "My lord Kotori,

01:03:19.916 --> 01:03:26.606
"we found them in the tunnels, but I don't think
they are necessarily the ones that have been

01:03:26.606 --> 01:03:45.696
"causing our problems." And Kotori takes a moment,
looking over all four of you. "Well. Explain

01:03:45.696 --> 01:03:53.585
"yourselves, then. What are you doing in our
tunnels, when we have a very fair agreement with

01:03:53.585 --> 01:03:58.493
"the vampires above that you mind your own
business?"

01:03:58.493 --> 01:04:07.443
LIAM: I step forward and begin to talk using
Presence Awe again. Which is charisma.

01:04:07.443 --> 01:04:09.638
TALIESIN: Roll your blood and then roll your
charisma.

01:04:09.638 --> 01:04:13.317
LIAM: So I roll a single blood die? That's a two.

01:04:13.317 --> 01:04:15.588
TALIESIN: You get one more hunger. Where are you
at?

01:04:15.588 --> 01:04:19.571
LIAM: I'm at four. I'm real hungry, lizard.

01:04:19.571 --> 01:04:36.688
TALIESIN: What am I going to do with that? Hold
on. All right, you're fine.

01:04:36.688 --> 01:04:43.038
LAURA: Oh, that's good. You got a critical
success.

01:04:43.038 --> 01:04:44.628
TALIESIN: One critical success?

01:04:44.628 --> 01:04:45.714
LIAM: Two.

01:04:45.714 --> 01:04:47.333
LAURA: He got two tens on blood dice.

01:04:47.333 --> 01:04:55.982
TALIESIN: Two tens? Oh my god. On blood dice? That
changes things, okay. That's good to know.

01:04:55.982 --> 01:05:09.212
LIAM: We mean no disrespect or harm, and are in
awe of what you have built here. We have wandered

01:05:09.212 --> 01:05:21.523
down by accident due to calamity and we are
children of the night in the purest sense. And we

01:05:21.523 --> 01:05:30.208
ask for patience and empathy for the unwise.

01:05:30.208 --> 01:05:35.291
SAM: Theater training.

01:05:35.291 --> 01:05:47.755
TALIESIN: So it worked. Definitely seems like
he's looking at you with nodding respect. Another

01:05:47.755 --> 01:05:58.766
gaunter lizard comes up to Kotori on the side. "Be
careful of this one. I think he's trying to

01:05:58.766 --> 01:06:06.365
"manipulate you." And Kotori sits and looks at you.

01:06:06.365 --> 01:06:22.962
LIAM: I'll go further. We are in fear and awe of
this council. No fucking joke. And all we want is

01:06:22.962 --> 01:06:32.384
safe passage and understanding. We don't mean to
subvert or cause problems. Merely to survive.

01:06:32.384 --> 01:06:41.983
TALIESIN: "There are rules and protocols in place
for these things. And ignorance of the law is not

01:06:41.983 --> 01:06:52.307
"absolution from the law. However, you did not
know. And the fact that you did not know goes to show

01:06:52.307 --> 01:07:04.109
"there's something very wrong. You should not exist
and not know this. Somebody has made a mistake."

01:07:04.109 --> 01:07:07.041
LAURA: Things are kind of crazy out there.

01:07:07.041 --> 01:07:11.200
SAM: So if you could undo it and make us humans
again, I think we'll be on our way.

01:07:11.200 --> 01:07:12.822
LIAM: He doesn't speak for all of us.

01:07:12.822 --> 01:07:15.017
TALIESIN: "I can make you lizards."

01:07:15.017 --> 01:07:20.362
SAM: That sounds amazing.

01:07:20.362 --> 01:07:22.517
LIAM and TRAVIS: Super cool.

01:07:22.517 --> 01:07:25.866
SAM: It would be really great, but we're still
getting used to this, though.

01:07:25.866 --> 01:07:29.241
LIAM: Might be too soon for a jump right away.

01:07:29.241 --> 01:07:32.842
TALIESIN: (laughing) "No, I can't do that."

01:07:32.842 --> 01:07:35.152
LAURA: Aww, you got us.

01:07:35.152 --> 01:07:39.124
TALIESIN: "But you're funny. You're not as smart
as the other ones, are you?"

01:07:39.124 --> 01:07:50.036
SAM: Apparently not. I mean, we haven't compared
SAT scores or anything, but we will later tonight.

01:07:50.036 --> 01:07:55.701
LIAM: Sam, this is like Being John Malkovich.
You're not the real John Malkovich. This is like a

01:07:55.701 --> 01:08:00.780
pretend John Malkovich. John Malkovich playing a
pretend John Malkovich. We'll pretend you aren't

01:08:00.780 --> 01:08:01.940
super keen.

01:08:01.940 --> 01:08:02.903
SAM: Sure.

01:08:02.903 --> 01:08:05.216
LIAM: Yeah. You look like a serial killer.

01:08:05.216 --> 01:08:08.847
TALIESIN: So disturbing. It's really hard to work
through.

01:08:08.847 --> 01:08:12.598
TRAVIS: My 1600 will hold up.

01:08:12.598 --> 01:08:15.309
SAM: 1600?

01:08:15.309 --> 01:08:21.834
TALIESIN: "Well, obviously the four of you are not
our problem. But the fact that you're down here is

01:08:21.834 --> 01:08:29.460
"our problem. There have been vampires in our
tunnels for three weeks."

01:08:29.460 --> 01:08:30.963
LAURA: Three weeks?

01:08:30.963 --> 01:08:38.374
TALIESIN: "There are rules, there are protocols,
and obviously they have been ignored. Do you have

01:08:38.374 --> 01:08:45.882
"any notion of what has been going on? Do you
perhaps have any kernel of thought as to the

01:08:45.882 --> 01:08:49.350
"nature of this? Why have people been in our
tunnels?"

01:08:49.350 --> 01:08:56.101
LIAM: Well, I'm not going to fluff us up. We don't
know much but we did come in contact with some

01:08:56.101 --> 01:08:59.460
sort of vampire lord.

01:08:59.460 --> 01:09:00.913
TALIESIN: "Interesting."

01:09:00.913 --> 01:09:07.611
LAURA: There was a giant meatball that seemed to
be turning people into other things.

01:09:07.611 --> 01:09:18.527
SAM: Yeah, that's true. There was also, I mean,
some sort of void under the game table, right? That

01:09:18.527 --> 01:09:20.452
could have plunged people down below?

01:09:20.452 --> 01:09:24.807
LAURA: Oh yeah. There was a guy that we know that
when we woke up all of a sudden he was a wizard

01:09:24.807 --> 01:09:27.039
and he had electricity coming off of him.

01:09:27.039 --> 01:09:30.904
TRAVIS: And are you familiar with one Gary
Gygax?

01:09:30.904 --> 01:09:41.863
TALIESIN: As he's about to speak, from the back,
one of the other lizards goes, "I've heard of Gary Gygax."

01:09:41.863 --> 01:09:55.271
TRAVIS: Yes. Many of us have. We were surprised to
see him up and walking about a mere hour after we

01:09:55.271 --> 01:09:57.890
woke and found ourselves in this state.

01:09:57.890 --> 01:10:06.092
TALIESIN: This other lizard comes up and starts
whispering in Kotori's ear. Seems very excited

01:10:06.092 --> 01:10:07.804
about something.

01:10:07.804 --> 01:10:09.692
LAURA: Do you play D&amp;D?

01:10:09.692 --> 01:10:11.069
SAM: He might be a Critter.

01:10:11.069 --> 01:10:19.301
TALIESIN: "We have internet down here, we're not
savages. Apparently members of our council are

01:10:19.301 --> 01:10:20.966
"aware of your show."

01:10:20.966 --> 01:10:30.561
SAM: They're everywhere! Critters are everywhere!

01:10:30.561 --> 01:10:32.767
TALIESIN: You are everywhere. You are literally
everywhere.

01:10:32.767 --> 01:10:35.677
TRAVIS: Did we grab any posters or fan art on our
way out?

01:10:35.677 --> 01:10:37.269
LIAM: They all burned up.

01:10:37.269 --> 01:10:39.459
TALIESIN: Things would have gone so much better if
you had.

01:10:39.459 --> 01:10:42.987
LAURA: Hey, I have some merch we were going
to sell in my pocket.

01:10:42.987 --> 01:10:49.196
LIAM: The airport, subways, lizard colonies.
There's always one guy.

01:10:49.196 --> 01:10:56.314
LAURA: Do you want coasters? I've got some
Strongjaw coasters.

01:10:56.314 --> 01:11:02.090
TALIESIN: Kotori is giving you an eye, but the
other guy is not making eye contact, he's breaking

01:11:02.090 --> 01:11:03.768
and making eye contact.

01:11:03.768 --> 01:11:06.425
LIAM: Is he as old as the rest?

01:11:06.425 --> 01:11:14.065
TALIESIN: It's hard to tell, man. What's the
difference? Can you tell the difference between an

01:11:14.065 --> 01:11:15.798
old iguana and a young iguana?

01:11:15.798 --> 01:11:20.033
LAURA: Sort of, like the scales are less vibrant.

01:11:20.033 --> 01:11:21.806
TALIESIN: They look pretty healthy.

01:11:21.806 --> 01:11:24.637
LIAM: I mean, how much is the iguana talking about
IRAs and shit?

01:11:24.637 --> 01:11:31.853
LAURA: Here's the thing. We just want to know
what's going on with us. We just want to know

01:11:31.853 --> 01:11:37.433
what's going on. We don't know anything. Is there
something we can do to help you that will, you

01:11:37.433 --> 01:11:42.134
know, we help you, you help us, help us figure out
what's happening.

01:11:42.134 --> 01:11:44.023
TRAVIS: Is there any way to be of service? We
don't mean to offend.

01:11:44.023 --> 01:11:45.292
SAM: We're good at catching rats.

01:11:45.292 --> 01:11:46.942
LAURA: Yeah, I'm really good at rat catching.

01:11:46.942 --> 01:11:50.051
TRAVIS: He's really fast. I can sense things.

01:11:50.051 --> 01:11:51.407
LAURA: I'm sneaky.

01:11:51.407 --> 01:11:56.518
LIAM: And also, do you have any human prisoners
down here or anything?

01:11:56.518 --> 01:11:59.901
TALIESIN: "Sadly, we do not."

01:11:59.901 --> 01:12:03.891
LAURA: Any other animals that you don't care
about?

01:12:03.891 --> 01:12:15.979
TALIESIN: "Sadly, no. The few animals we do have
here have purposes. In the menagerie. But perhaps

01:12:15.979 --> 01:12:18.242
"we can come to an arrangement."

01:12:18.242 --> 01:12:20.257
TRAVIS: We're very interested in that.

01:12:20.257 --> 01:12:28.534
TALIESIN: "Something has gone wrong. We are going
to have to re-establish some rules, and you're

01:12:28.534 --> 01:12:30.718
"obviously someone else's problem."

01:12:30.718 --> 01:12:32.178
TRAVIS: Clearly.

01:12:32.178 --> 01:12:39.726
TALIESIN: "We will give you passage to the
surface. We will show you where you can come in

01:12:39.726 --> 01:12:44.750
"contact with some individuals who can clear things
up."

01:12:44.750 --> 01:12:46.474
SAM: Passage to the surface?

01:12:46.474 --> 01:12:47.508
LAURA: That's good.

01:12:47.508 --> 01:12:53.230
TALIESIN: "We will send you to the people whose
problem you are, as opposed to ours. And in return

01:12:53.230 --> 01:13:01.222
"you will deliver a message. You will tell them
that we are displeased and that we have to have

01:13:01.222 --> 01:13:10.593
"words and that they must find a way of becoming
friends with us again. We will need--"

01:13:10.593 --> 01:13:13.122
LAURA: A boon!

01:13:13.122 --> 01:13:24.397
TALIESIN: "A boon. They will owe us for their
transgression. And you will deliver our message."

01:13:24.397 --> 01:13:26.193
LAURA: We can do that.

01:13:26.193 --> 01:13:31.351
SAM: Sure. It doesn't seem like a great message to
deliver to someone. Just saying, like, they might

01:13:31.351 --> 01:13:32.433
be upset with us.

01:13:32.433 --> 01:13:37.671
TALIESIN: "Oh, they may kill you. Vampires are not
known for their kindness."

01:13:37.671 --> 01:13:39.371
TRAVIS: Well, we might change that.

01:13:39.371 --> 01:13:42.097
LAURA: I mean, we're really nice. Pretty
genuine--

01:13:42.097 --> 01:13:47.619
LIAM: I'm a good talker these days. These
hours. If I could maybe eat?

01:13:47.619 --> 01:13:52.001
TRAVIS: We're very interested in getting to the
surface. We will deliver your message as you've

01:13:52.001 --> 01:13:53.213
described it.

01:13:53.213 --> 01:13:54.505
LIAM: Gratefully.

01:13:54.505 --> 01:13:59.778
SAM: But I feel like if it's nighttime we should
probably hurry. Because we can't be up there when

01:13:59.778 --> 01:14:01.238
the sun comes up.

01:14:01.238 --> 01:14:02.609
LAURA: No, it'll kill us. I saw what happened to
Matt.

01:14:02.609 --> 01:14:03.561
LIAM: No, yeah.

01:14:03.561 --> 01:14:12.244
TALIESIN: "You won't have to be up there for very
long. Lock! Mahlo! Take them to the pyramid. Show

01:14:12.244 --> 01:14:14.174
"them to Los Globos."

01:14:14.174 --> 01:14:19.555
LAURA: How long have you been a lizard person,
Lock? Have you always been a lizard person?

01:14:19.631 --> 01:14:22.609
TALIESIN: "Yes, of course."

01:14:22.609 --> 01:14:25.838
LAURA: Are you thousands of years old?

01:14:25.838 --> 01:14:35.822
TALIESIN: "No, we've been here for thousands of
years. I am merely 250, 300 at this point."

01:14:35.822 --> 01:14:38.348
TRAVIS: Infancy. Got it.

01:14:38.348 --> 01:14:43.782
LAURA: Cool. Just wondering.

01:14:43.782 --> 01:14:46.556
TALIESIN: "You'll know what that feels like if
you're lucky."

01:14:46.556 --> 01:14:50.000
LIAM: (whispering) That's what I'm talking about,
Travis!

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:53.554
LAURA: I mean, we might not change back you guys.

01:14:53.554 --> 01:14:54.933
SAM: But what about our friends, our family?

01:14:54.933 --> 01:14:57.555
TRAVIS: Yeah, and fashion trends? They're such a
bitch to keep up with.

01:14:57.555 --> 01:15:04.987
SAM: You're just going to give up everyone you
know and love to be immortal sewer vampires?

01:15:04.987 --> 01:15:14.078
LIAM: Yeah, Sam! Yeah! This feels great! I mean,
I'm hungry, but we get to spend time together for

01:15:14.078 --> 01:15:15.987
fucking ever!

01:15:15.987 --> 01:15:19.006
SAM: I love hanging out with you, but it's not
like we can podcast from down here.

01:15:19.006 --> 01:15:21.835
LIAM: They've got internet.

01:15:21.835 --> 01:15:27.492
TALIESIN: "We have actually really good broadband
down here. It's insane."

01:15:27.492 --> 01:15:31.287
LIAM: Question. Have you heard AllWorkNoPlay? Any
episodes?

01:15:31.287 --> 01:15:33.013
TALIESIN: "Of course, yeah. I've listened to the
whole thing."

01:15:33.013 --> 01:15:35.070
LIAM: You've got nothing. You've got nothing!

01:15:35.070 --> 01:15:37.104
TRAVIS: Their router obviously runs through
Malaysia.

01:15:37.104 --> 01:15:39.896
SAM: I'll think about it.

01:15:39.896 --> 01:15:42.868
LAURA: Let's go.

01:15:42.868 --> 01:15:43.884
TRAVIS: We're ready to go.

01:15:43.884 --> 01:15:51.211
TALIESIN: "Good luck. And, Lock, see if you can't
wrangle them up something to eat on the way up

01:15:51.211 --> 01:16:02.076
"there." Lock nods and starts leading you all,
along with Mahlo, who's definitely not quite

01:16:02.076 --> 01:16:08.574
grinning. I'm not entirely sure what you would
call this weird curl at the side as they lead you

01:16:08.574 --> 01:16:10.264
to the pyramid at the very back.

01:16:10.264 --> 01:16:12.726
LIAM: Is it one of these smiles?

01:16:12.726 --> 01:16:14.846
LAURA: It's one of those.

01:16:14.846 --> 01:16:16.152
TALIESIN: It's like an iguana smile.

01:16:16.152 --> 01:16:18.509
LAURA: Oh, cute. Marlo?

01:16:18.509 --> 01:16:29.461
TALIESIN: Mahlo, Lock, Kotori are the three we've
met so far. Mahlo and Lock are taking you to the

01:16:29.461 --> 01:16:30.700
pyramid.

01:16:30.700 --> 01:16:33.098
LIAM: Which leads to Los Globos?

01:16:33.098 --> 01:16:34.350
TALIESIN: You'll find out.

01:16:34.350 --> 01:16:39.833
SAM: Does anyone speak Spanish? What does Los
Globos mean?

01:16:39.833 --> 01:16:41.996
TALIESIN: I'm so amused by all of this.

01:16:41.996 --> 01:16:46.093
SAM: The Globos. What does that mean?

01:16:46.093 --> 01:16:50.856
TALIESIN: As you walk back across the lake, past
the not-quite-abandoned zoo, but slightly

01:16:50.856 --> 01:16:54.392
abandoned, there are definitely some creatures in
there that look vaguely familiar.

01:16:54.392 --> 01:16:56.172
LIAM: They're not typical, though?

01:16:56.172 --> 01:17:00.595
TALIESIN: There's something a little off about all
of them. It's as if somebody had grabbed a mountain

01:17:00.595 --> 01:17:05.576
lion and bred them for a few centuries and saw
what happened without sunlight. So they've all

01:17:05.576 --> 01:17:11.549
started to lose their eyes and they've all got the
little bit of milky, appendage eye. Everything's

01:17:11.549 --> 01:17:13.037
gotten a little weird down here.

01:17:13.037 --> 01:17:16.612
LAURA: Creepy. Ooh, very much like The Descent.

01:17:16.612 --> 01:17:21.210
TALIESIN: And there's a lot, again, that white
luminescent algae everywhere. That spiky,

01:17:21.210 --> 01:17:23.871
crystalline white luminescent algae is
everywhere.

01:17:23.871 --> 01:17:24.993
LIAM: Gross.

01:17:24.993 --> 01:17:28.034
LAURA: Cool. I'm excited to get up top.

01:17:28.034 --> 01:17:35.948
TALIESIN: So as you climb the steps of the
pyramid, and I'm going to also point out, this is

01:17:35.948 --> 01:17:40.929
obviously a man-made pyramid and maybe only about
80 years old, and like, Disneyland-bullshit

01:17:40.929 --> 01:17:47.094
pyramid, definitely a little iffy and has seen
better days.

01:17:47.094 --> 01:17:54.564
LIAM: Guys, so, careful. I do not want to get
Mercer-ed. Or you guys, but especially me. Let's go.

01:17:54.564 --> 01:17:57.123
TALIESIN: You don't want to get Mercer-ed? Or
Marisha-ed?

01:17:57.123 --> 01:18:00.475
LAURA: Or that. I feel like Marisha-ed is worse.

01:18:00.475 --> 01:18:03.631
TALIESIN: Marisha-ed is worse, in my opinion. If
you're going to go, go quick.

01:18:03.631 --> 01:18:05.530
LIAM: Worse, but Mercer-ed seems easier to happen.

01:18:05.530 --> 01:18:12.782
TALIESIN: That requires a Power Ranger helmet,
too. You make your way up the slightly cartoonish

01:18:12.782 --> 01:18:22.354
pyramid. At the very top, there's another one of
those weird little square cube exits that you saw

01:18:22.354 --> 01:18:23.507
in the sewer.

01:18:23.507 --> 01:18:25.260
LIAM: So the pyramid goes all the way to the top?

01:18:25.260 --> 01:18:32.316
TALIESIN: All the way to the top, and then there's
a drop ladder that goes right into a little brick

01:18:32.316 --> 01:18:37.138
cavern. It's only big enough for one person at a
time, and you have to crawl up on those awful fire

01:18:37.138 --> 01:18:44.224
escape ladders from the 40s, and there's more of
that awful white crystalline algae.

01:18:44.224 --> 01:18:50.120
TRAVIS: I'll go first this time. I'm very
perceptive. I can hear and smell and see things.

01:18:50.120 --> 01:18:51.695
LAURA: It's really high though, baby.

01:18:51.695 --> 01:18:58.702
TRAVIS: I'm a fucking vampire. I'll fly up there.
I go and I try to fly.

01:18:58.702 --> 01:19:05.159
TALIESIN: Cool, actually-- I'm so fucking with
you.

01:19:05.159 --> 01:19:10.875
TRAVIS: Aw, damn it! I thought I was going to Lost
Boys that shit. Fuck!

01:19:10.875 --> 01:19:21.375
TALIESIN: You cool. You ain't that cool. Are you
actually going to try and--? Give me a dexterity

01:19:21.375 --> 01:19:23.858
athletics.

01:19:23.858 --> 01:19:36.972
TRAVIS: Okay. Wait, (mumbling). All successes, no
failures, and one ten.

01:19:36.972 --> 01:19:38.144
TALIESIN: How many successes?

01:19:38.144 --> 01:19:39.926
TRAVIS: One, two, three, four, five.

01:19:39.926 --> 01:19:46.347
TALIESIN: You don't fly, but you manage, after you
make a good leap, and by the time you realize that

01:19:46.347 --> 01:19:52.092
gravity is reasserting itself upon your person,
you are smart enough to extend your hands and legs

01:19:52.092 --> 01:19:53.690
out and--

01:19:53.690 --> 01:19:56.675
LIAM: Flying squirrel.

01:19:56.675 --> 01:20:02.382
TALIESIN: You made a good hop. It was impressive.
It was very impressive.

01:20:02.382 --> 01:20:03.766
LAURA: Baby, did you fly?

01:20:03.766 --> 01:20:05.894
TRAVIS: I didn't want to show off too long.

01:20:05.894 --> 01:20:07.373
LAURA: Holy--!

01:20:07.373 --> 01:20:09.424
SAM: I'm going to try to turn into a bat.

01:20:09.424 --> 01:20:15.109
LIAM: See, vampires are fucking awesome. Your
husband can fly. My husband can run.

01:20:15.109 --> 01:20:20.659
TALIESIN: How are we going to do this? Give me a
willpower check. Just straight willpower.

01:20:20.659 --> 01:20:24.846
LIAM: What are you doing? You're trying to turn
into a bat? Oh my god. Do it.

01:20:24.846 --> 01:20:27.210
SAM: Three successes.

01:20:27.210 --> 01:20:31.459
TALIESIN: Three successes? You do not give a
little squirt of poop, then. Well done.

01:20:31.459 --> 01:20:34.454
SAM: (straining)

01:20:34.454 --> 01:20:37.806
LIAM: You feel it, but it stays up inside.

01:20:37.806 --> 01:20:41.184
SAM: We can't be bats.

01:20:41.184 --> 01:20:43.045
TALIESIN: &lt;i&gt;You&lt;/i&gt; can't be bats.

01:20:43.045 --> 01:20:46.347
SAM: But maybe we can walk through walls and
shit?

01:20:46.347 --> 01:20:47.727
LAURA: We haven't tried it.

01:20:47.727 --> 01:20:55.014
TRAVIS: I make my way up toward the ladder.

01:20:55.014 --> 01:21:05.332
TALIESIN: Eventually, after quite a few feet, that
ladder goes up and up and up. It's about 450, 500

01:21:05.332 --> 01:21:08.264
feet before anything stops.

01:21:08.264 --> 01:21:10.673
LIAM: And we're all in the top of this ziggurat?

01:21:10.673 --> 01:21:15.603
TALIESIN: And then it's a 90 degree turn and that
brick cavern goes straight out. It is a very

01:21:15.603 --> 01:21:17.428
claustrophobic crawl.

01:21:17.428 --> 01:21:19.305
LIAM: (yelling) Travis!

01:21:19.305 --> 01:21:21.261
TRAVIS: So the ladder goes straight up, and then
it turns?

01:21:21.261 --> 01:21:22.561
TALIESIN: Just L's really hard.

01:21:22.561 --> 01:21:24.567
TRAVIS: At the surface, or into more under-earth?

01:21:24.567 --> 01:21:28.323
TALIESIN: More underground, in that same cube
that's not big enough to stand up in. It's about

01:21:28.323 --> 01:21:30.821
maybe three feet by three feet. It's a little
claustrophobic.

01:21:30.821 --> 01:21:31.906
LIAM: Blam!

01:21:31.906 --> 01:21:38.632
TRAVIS: Yeah. I'm up here. There's a tunnel that
continues at the top of this stupidly, absurdly

01:21:38.632 --> 01:21:44.282
long ladder. It's only single-file. I guess you
guys can make your way up here, and we can crawl

01:21:44.282 --> 01:21:49.842
wherever this goes. Will you ask Mahlo if we're
supposed to crawl through this?

01:21:49.842 --> 01:21:54.073
LAURA: Mahlo, are we supposed to crawl through
that tunnel? He's nodding!

01:21:54.073 --> 01:21:58.573
TRAVIS: Okay. Well, go ahead and come up. I'll get
started.

01:21:58.573 --> 01:22:04.591
LIAM: I'll give you a boost, but how are we all
going to--? Okay. This comes naturally.

01:22:04.591 --> 01:22:06.930
TRAVIS: Do I hear anything in the tunnel, now that
I'm up there?

01:22:06.930 --> 01:22:09.947
TALIESIN: Do you want to listen, or do you want to
&lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; listen?

01:22:09.947 --> 01:22:13.788
TRAVIS: With four red dice, I'll just listen.

01:22:13.788 --> 01:22:15.095
TALIESIN: No.

01:22:15.095 --> 01:22:16.824
TRAVIS: Okay.

01:22:16.824 --> 01:22:18.054
LIAM: Do you still have that cable?

01:22:18.054 --> 01:22:20.294
SAM: Yeah, of course. It's all coiled up.

01:22:20.294 --> 01:22:23.051
TALIESIN: I love that you're Indiana Jones-ing
this.

01:22:23.051 --> 01:22:26.084
LIAM: So one of us boosts the other up, drops the
cable. Don't dick me.

01:22:26.084 --> 01:22:30.378
SAM: Of course not, but I don't know if an XLR
cable will hold us.

01:22:30.378 --> 01:22:34.184
LIAM: It's got to. I mean, neither of us are
Willingham.

01:22:34.184 --> 01:22:35.633
LAURA: You could try to jump.

01:22:35.633 --> 01:22:37.200
LIAM: I could try. It's not going to be pretty.

01:22:37.200 --> 01:22:45.618
SAM: Wait, I'll lift you up. My powers, I can walk
up walls and shit, can't I? There's no wall to

01:22:45.618 --> 01:22:46.668
walk up?

01:22:46.668 --> 01:22:51.078
LIAM: Thousands of feet away! We're at the top of a
ziggurat looking at the ceiling!

01:22:51.078 --> 01:22:53.974
TRAVIS: Do I see anything, like a switch or a
button, to lower something?

01:22:53.974 --> 01:23:02.712
TALIESIN: No, although, I mean, you're way up
there, now. You've left these plebs behind. Lock

01:23:02.712 --> 01:23:04.526
will also look around and do the--

01:23:04.526 --> 01:23:06.618
SAM: Oh, he can help!

01:23:06.618 --> 01:23:09.431
LIAM: Yeah, Lock, can you boost my friend?

01:23:09.431 --> 01:23:12.093
TALIESIN: "Yes, of course, yes. We can do that."

01:23:12.093 --> 01:23:16.420
SAM: We'll sign, like, a Player's Handbook.

01:23:16.420 --> 01:23:22.128
TALIESIN: "I don't care." Mahlo is losing their
shit a little bit.

01:23:22.128 --> 01:23:24.744
LIAM: Don't offer to Mahlo.

01:23:24.744 --> 01:23:29.839
TALIESIN: It hurts, man. I give you a Critter, and
that's how you--?

01:23:29.839 --> 01:23:35.367
LAURA: I'm going to drop the dice down to Mahlo as
I'm climbing.

01:23:35.367 --> 01:23:36.915
TALIESIN: Mahlo will remember this.

01:23:36.915 --> 01:23:38.307
LAURA: I keep climbing.

01:23:38.307 --> 01:23:41.344
SAM: All right, so you boost me up?

01:23:41.344 --> 01:23:53.152
LIAM: Mahlo, come here. Let me find a Sharpie. I
write on his arm, "VAX ///" Let's go.

01:23:53.152 --> 01:23:54.333
TALIESIN: "Cool!"

01:23:54.333 --> 01:23:56.522
LAURA: See, you're so cool.

01:23:56.522 --> 01:24:02.859
LIAM: I'm not, but that's what I did. I'm not at
all. And I step on Sam's back and I jump.

01:24:02.859 --> 01:24:10.064
TALIESIN: Give me a dex athletics just for fun.
That's okay. This is not hard.

01:24:10.064 --> 01:24:19.646
LIAM: I'm not talking about the character sheet.
Dex athletics, okay. Ooh, well, one success on a

01:24:19.646 --> 01:24:23.063
blood die, and one fail on a non-blood die.

01:24:23.063 --> 01:24:29.863
TALIESIN: Nothing bad happens, but you miss on
your first attempt. You can get one more.

01:24:29.863 --> 01:24:34.885
LIAM: Same shit? Yeah. Two successes.

01:24:34.885 --> 01:24:39.882
TALIESIN: That's all you needed. Actually, I
should have done the-- never mind. I can use that

01:24:39.882 --> 01:24:43.514
next time. I keep forgetting I have this mechanic
they gave me that's super cool, and I'm not taking

01:24:43.514 --> 01:24:49.922
advantage of it. Sorry, White Wolf. I'll start
doing that, because it's a cool mechanic. I think

01:24:49.922 --> 01:24:54.128
they're in chat. Yeah, you make it. You're
crawling up. You guys are going?

01:24:54.128 --> 01:24:57.306
LIAM: Yeah, boys, can you help my friend up?

01:24:57.306 --> 01:24:59.920
TALIESIN: Yeah, they'll give you a little boost
up.

01:24:59.920 --> 01:25:01.049
SAM: Great.

01:25:01.049 --> 01:25:04.194
TALIESIN: You can get, at whatever speed you
like, that you want to get up there, because you

01:25:04.194 --> 01:25:05.383
are fast as all hell.

01:25:05.383 --> 01:25:07.137
SAM: I'll hang with Liam. Got to stay close.

01:25:07.137 --> 01:25:09.060
LAURA: I'm already up and behind. I'm second.

01:25:09.060 --> 01:25:13.081
TALIESIN: You've got a long tunnel to crawl
to. It is not comfortable. It is a little

01:25:13.081 --> 01:25:20.705
claustrophobic. It's a little cramped. I want
everyone to, really quickly, roll a d10 for me.

01:25:20.705 --> 01:25:25.819
LIAM: You're so big in a small space. Seven.

01:25:25.819 --> 01:25:28.003
SAM: Non-success. Four.

01:25:28.003 --> 01:25:30.244
TRAVIS: I rolled a one.

01:25:30.244 --> 01:25:36.912
TALIESIN: You rolled a one, though? Let's have a
little fun with you. Where's my little chart?

01:25:36.912 --> 01:25:45.492
Where's my chart of pain? I have too many papers.
Ah, here we go. There's my chart of pain. Let's

01:25:45.492 --> 01:25:47.003
give you--

01:25:47.003 --> 01:25:54.160
SAM: I'm going to be wearing this costume every
day for the next few days. This is my Halloween

01:25:54.160 --> 01:25:55.564
costume.

01:25:55.564 --> 01:25:58.264
LAURA: It's really bad. Maybe get a different
one.

01:25:58.264 --> 01:26:00.992
SAM: Laura, my eyes are up here, okay?

01:26:00.992 --> 01:26:07.896
TALIESIN: You've got the hangries. You're a
little irritated. You're having trouble thinking

01:26:07.896 --> 01:26:12.414
clearly and you are not subtle about anything.
You're going to have a really hard time being

01:26:12.414 --> 01:26:18.379
clever. It's just that, yeah. It doesn't feel
good. You get what I'm getting at? Travis, do you

01:26:18.379 --> 01:26:20.297
understand? Are you sure you're clear?

01:26:20.297 --> 01:26:22.637
TRAVIS: Yeah yeah yeah. I will fucking fang you
right now.

01:26:22.637 --> 01:26:31.703
TALIESIN: Cool. So yeah, this is a bit of a trek.
You come out, as you finally breach through, and

01:26:31.703 --> 01:26:36.384
you seem to be in a crypt in the Hollywood
cemetery.

01:26:36.384 --> 01:26:40.531
LIAM: We're within a mausoleum, or something?

01:26:40.531 --> 01:26:41.751
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm.

01:26:41.751 --> 01:26:43.780
LAURA: Can I see a door? Is there a door?

01:26:43.780 --> 01:26:49.730
TALIESIN: There is a gate. It is unlocked. This is
practically an easy access to the surface.

01:26:49.730 --> 01:26:52.024
LAURA: Is there anything cool in this room? Are
there buttons?

01:26:52.024 --> 01:27:01.833
TALIESIN: There are two caskets stacked on the
side, other than this little broken hole in the

01:27:01.833 --> 01:27:03.769
floor that you came through.

01:27:03.769 --> 01:27:06.795
LIAM: A metal gate? That we can see through?

01:27:06.795 --> 01:27:08.635
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, you can see through it. It's
just a gate.

01:27:08.635 --> 01:27:10.900
SAM: Is it night still?

01:27:10.900 --> 01:27:14.323
TALIESIN: It is still night. Just barely.

01:27:14.323 --> 01:27:17.165
SAM: So wait, there's a gate that prevents us from
leaving this crypt?

01:27:17.165 --> 01:27:20.213
TALIESIN: Well, it's not locked or
anything. It's just a gate.

01:27:20.213 --> 01:27:23.685
TRAVIS: Does anybody else want to open the fucking
door, for once?

01:27:23.685 --> 01:27:25.805
TALIESIN: I'm not going to make you fight doors.
It is getting a little cramped in here because

01:27:25.805 --> 01:27:28.149
it's only big enough for, like, four coffins, and
it's already two coffins full.

01:27:28.149 --> 01:27:29.944
LIAM: Is there any writing in here?

01:27:29.944 --> 01:27:34.122
TALIESIN: There is a name-- No, there's actually
no writing on the inside. It's all on the

01:27:34.122 --> 01:27:35.057
outside.

01:27:35.057 --> 01:27:36.278
LAURA: I open the gate.

01:27:36.278 --> 01:27:40.121
LIAM: I duck behind one of the coffins.

01:27:40.121 --> 01:27:42.997
TALIESIN: It's filthy. But other than that--

01:27:42.997 --> 01:27:44.176
LIAM: Okay, that's fine.

01:27:44.176 --> 01:27:51.655
TALIESIN: All right, you step out into the late
night. It feels like time did not move at an

01:27:51.655 --> 01:27:57.884
appropriate speed, like, the night is still darker
than it should be. You don't know how long you

01:27:57.884 --> 01:28:01.834
were down there, but it feels like you were down
there a little longer than this.

01:28:01.834 --> 01:28:06.214
LAURA: Is it possible an entire day passed while
we were down there? Because it's still real super dark.

01:28:06.214 --> 01:28:08.134
TALIESIN: It's entirely possible, but you're not
sure.

01:28:08.134 --> 01:28:12.508
SAM: We were so fast that we got here in like ten
minutes.

01:28:12.508 --> 01:28:15.423
TRAVIS: Is there a name on the outside of the
crypt that we walked out of?

01:28:15.423 --> 01:28:18.217
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm. It just says "Macbeth."

01:28:18.217 --> 01:28:21.677
LIAM: Now that's happy.

01:28:21.677 --> 01:28:25.469
TRAVIS: Hollywood cemetery.

01:28:25.469 --> 01:28:26.805
SAM: Are there humans around?

01:28:26.805 --> 01:28:31.001
TALIESIN: There are definitely some humans around,
just walking around.

01:28:31.001 --> 01:28:32.717
SAM: Is it movie night?

01:28:32.717 --> 01:28:35.562
TALIESIN: It is not movie night. For those of you
who don't know, we have movie nights at our

01:28:35.562 --> 01:28:37.066
cemetery because that's fun.

01:28:37.066 --> 01:28:38.313
LIAM: Is it a goth party?

01:28:38.313 --> 01:28:39.455
TALIESIN: It's not a goth party.

01:28:39.455 --> 01:28:42.176
LAURA: It's just regular humans, nobody seems
scared? They're not running around, it's not scary?

01:28:42.176 --> 01:28:44.450
TRAVIS: Do they look like they're paying their
respects?

01:28:44.450 --> 01:28:48.873
TALIESIN: They look like hipsters in Hollywood,
hanging out at the hipster cemetery.

01:28:48.873 --> 01:28:50.940
TRAVIS: Oh, okay. Great.

01:28:50.940 --> 01:28:52.442
SAM: Are you guys going to feed?

01:28:52.442 --> 01:28:58.691
TRAVIS: No! I am going to do a little natural
selection. Is there anyone that looks like they

01:28:58.691 --> 01:29:07.267
are weak and clearly ailing and ready to have it
all come to an end?

01:29:07.267 --> 01:29:09.442
LIAM: I'm looking for loners.

01:29:09.442 --> 01:29:12.334
TALIESIN: If you walk around a little bit--

01:29:12.334 --> 01:29:15.487
LAURA: I'm suddenly super uncomfortable with it.

01:29:15.487 --> 01:29:18.353
SAM: Is there a group of these guys, of these
humans?

01:29:18.353 --> 01:29:23.754
TALIESIN: Are you going to look around and find a
potential victim? I'm going to say right now, from

01:29:23.754 --> 01:29:29.489
your experience, it is possible not to kill people
when you drink from them, by the way.

01:29:29.489 --> 01:29:30.708
LIAM: Whatever.

01:29:30.708 --> 01:29:32.287
TALIESIN: I know. Good for you.

01:29:32.287 --> 01:29:34.455
TRAVIS: I'm definitely looking for somebody. I've
got four red dice.

01:29:34.455 --> 01:29:41.224
TALIESIN: What's your hunger level? Okay, so you
definitely have something resembling morality

01:29:41.224 --> 01:29:42.352
functioning right now.

01:29:42.352 --> 01:29:46.347
SAM: Listen, let's not jump the gun on this.
I know you guys are hungry, but let's do this

01:29:46.347 --> 01:29:55.676
smart. I'm fast, you're stealthy, right? Okay, how
about this. Me and Laura will go around. I'll

01:29:55.676 --> 01:30:02.185
chase them toward you. Laura can keep them
contained, and we'll drive them to you guys rather

01:30:02.185 --> 01:30:05.311
than us trying to chase them, we'll drive them
this way.

01:30:05.311 --> 01:30:08.512
TRAVIS: Question. If we try and herd them, won't
they be doing that human thing called screaming,

01:30:08.512 --> 01:30:10.090
and making a racket?

01:30:10.090 --> 01:30:15.045
SAM: But it's a cemetery, and they're hipsters!
They could be joking around with each other.

01:30:15.045 --> 01:30:20.300
LIAM: I'm already gone. I'm looking for somebody
on their own. I'm looking for an antelope away

01:30:20.300 --> 01:30:21.445
from the herd.

01:30:21.445 --> 01:30:26.921
TALIESIN: Okay, and I'll add, you still have two
lizard people who have now put up little hoods so

01:30:26.921 --> 01:30:31.086
they're a little more incognito, but it's
Hollywood, so who really would notice two people

01:30:31.086 --> 01:30:36.387
with lizard faces? Legitimately, we wouldn't care.
We don't care. This is how they've been here for

01:30:36.387 --> 01:30:43.812
five thousand years. No one cares. Yeah, there's
a, well, there's always the porta-potties.

01:30:43.812 --> 01:30:45.926
LIAM: Sure.

01:30:45.926 --> 01:30:48.687
LAURA: Ugh, stinky meal.

01:30:48.687 --> 01:30:51.233
LIAM: Sure. I'm into it.

01:30:51.233 --> 01:30:55.638
TALIESIN: You're into it? All right. As you curl
around, there's usually that little set that are

01:30:55.638 --> 01:30:58.575
out by the street, and there's not too many people
in the cemetery tonight, wandering

01:30:58.575 --> 01:30:59.685
around being silly.

01:30:59.685 --> 01:31:04.524
LIAM: So I look for one of the porta-potties
that's got the little circle turned to red, right?

01:31:04.524 --> 01:31:07.534
Yeah. (knocking)

01:31:07.534 --> 01:31:12.820
TALIESIN: "Just a minute!"

01:31:12.820 --> 01:31:14.502
LIAM: I forcibly yank it open.

01:31:14.502 --> 01:31:17.714
TALIESIN: You can give a try. See how this goes.

01:31:17.714 --> 01:31:19.771
SAM: You don't have superhuman strength, right?
You're just Liam.

01:31:19.771 --> 01:31:24.987
LIAM: Yeah, you know how shitty porta-potties are
built? I'm pretty sure this is the one thing I

01:31:24.987 --> 01:31:27.996
could break open. The one thing.

01:31:27.996 --> 01:31:30.235
TALIESIN: Strength brawl.

01:31:30.235 --> 01:31:38.700
LIAM: Sure. Oh, that's going to be shitty.
Strength. Ooh, what do I--? I have more blood die

01:31:38.700 --> 01:31:46.326
than strength and brawl combined. All blood die?
Word. One fail.

01:31:46.326 --> 01:31:47.495
TALIESIN: Only one fail?

01:31:47.495 --> 01:31:48.518
LAURA: But no successes!

01:31:48.518 --> 01:31:50.078
SAM: And it's a blood die.

01:31:50.078 --> 01:31:53.818
TRAVIS: "I'm pretty sure this is the one thing I
can break into."

01:31:53.818 --> 01:32:00.575
TALIESIN: You pull, and you're not succeeding.
You're like, thunk, thunk! And all you hear from

01:32:00.575 --> 01:32:03.919
the inside is, "Dude, really? Come on!"

01:32:03.919 --> 01:32:08.111
LIAM: Yeah, sorry, man, it's uncalled-for. I'm
sorry. I'm going to wait until he's done.

01:32:08.111 --> 01:32:09.370
TALIESIN: You're going to wait?

01:32:09.370 --> 01:32:18.526
LIAM: I'm waiting in line, and as soon as the door
opens, as soon as I hear k-chunk, I'm yanking it

01:32:18.526 --> 01:32:22.983
open and pushing in. I'm biting. Yeah. As soon as
that door's open.

01:32:22.983 --> 01:32:27.040
TALIESIN: You wait for a minute, and there's
definitely sounds coming from in there.

01:32:27.040 --> 01:32:28.509
LAURA: It's going to be so stinky!

01:32:28.509 --> 01:32:36.180
TALIESIN: It's a blue porta-potty. This is what
you're getting. Are you going to take a moment to

01:32:36.180 --> 01:32:37.787
look around and see if anybody's looking?

01:32:37.787 --> 01:32:39.330
LIAM: Of course!

01:32:39.330 --> 01:32:44.509
TALIESIN: All right, so you hear things finishing
up there, take a look around. Give me a

01:32:44.509 --> 01:32:49.325
perception, where are we, perception awareness.

01:32:49.325 --> 01:32:54.365
LAURA: He's taking a while. Eww.

01:32:54.365 --> 01:33:01.749
LIAM: I'm so hungry. Oh no, I need another blood
die. That's great. Three successes, one failure.

01:33:01.749 --> 01:33:03.463
TALIESIN: Three successes, one failure?

01:33:03.463 --> 01:33:04.643
LIAM: The successes are on blood die.

01:33:04.643 --> 01:33:22.665
TALIESIN: But one failure? Okay, the door unlocks,
starts to swing open, and you're in. You didn't

01:33:22.665 --> 01:33:23.981
even look? You're going for it?

01:33:23.981 --> 01:33:25.433
LIAM: Yeah, I'm going.

01:33:25.433 --> 01:33:32.558
TALIESIN: All right, you're in. So let me remember
how to do this. I'm so amused.

01:33:32.558 --> 01:33:34.034
LAURA: I feel like there are more subtle ways to
get blood.

01:33:34.034 --> 01:33:36.089
TALIESIN: There are absolutely more subtle ways,
but that's not how this is happening.

01:33:36.089 --> 01:33:43.512
LIAM: I don't care, I'm so fucking hungry right
now. What happens if I wanted to use Dread Gaze on

01:33:43.512 --> 01:33:44.711
this person?

01:33:44.711 --> 01:33:45.644
TALIESIN: You could attempt to.

01:33:45.644 --> 01:33:46.953
LIAM: But I risk more hunger, right?

01:33:46.953 --> 01:33:48.234
TALIESIN: Yeah, but at this point?

01:33:48.234 --> 01:33:54.305
LIAM: No, I'm not going to do that yet. What do I
do?

01:33:54.305 --> 01:34:04.033
TALIESIN: Where am I? It's strength brawl plus
two.

01:34:04.033 --> 01:34:15.796
LIAM: Okay. Two successes and one failure.

01:34:15.796 --> 01:34:21.640
TALIESIN: Two successes and one failure? Is that
with the plus two from the vampire fangs?

01:34:21.640 --> 01:34:28.120
LIAM: Yes, wait, what did I roll? It's brawl plus
something plus two, you said, right?

01:34:28.120 --> 01:34:30.129
TALIESIN: Yeah, strength, plus brawl, plus two.

01:34:30.129 --> 01:34:31.944
LIAM: So I actually rolled too many die.

01:34:31.944 --> 01:34:35.498
TALIESIN: Oh, try again. This is a new
system, I'm being gentle on people.

01:34:35.498 --> 01:34:41.803
LIAM: Two successes, one failure. Same thing.

01:34:41.803 --> 01:34:49.920
TALIESIN: Okay. And the one failure's a one? All right.
It's a bit of a struggle, but you get in there.

01:34:49.920 --> 01:34:54.488
LIAM: Yeah, we're in, already! Nobody can see us
in here! They probably think we're macking.

01:34:54.488 --> 01:34:56.503
TALIESIN: How heavy are you draining this person?

01:34:56.503 --> 01:35:01.077
LIAM: Well, I'm new at this, so I don't know. If I
keep going, do I get fed more?

01:35:01.077 --> 01:35:06.372
TALIESIN: You can top off if you like, but if--
yeah. You can attempt to top off, or you can feed

01:35:06.372 --> 01:35:08.211
until you're not ravenous.

01:35:08.211 --> 01:35:09.556
LIAM: Let's top off.

01:35:09.556 --> 01:35:10.770
TALIESIN: You're going to top off?

01:35:10.770 --> 01:35:12.568
LIAM: Well, I don't know what that means, but yes.
Let's top off.

01:35:12.568 --> 01:35:13.751
TALIESIN: You're going to drink until you don't
want to drink any more?

01:35:13.751 --> 01:35:14.815
LAURA: You're going to kill him.

01:35:14.815 --> 01:35:15.779
LIAM: Yes.

01:35:15.779 --> 01:35:21.134
TALIESIN: All right, you are at zero hunger. You
feel perfectly normal, and you have a body in here.

01:35:21.134 --> 01:35:25.015
LIAM: Yes I do. And do I give you any of these
blood die? All of them?

01:35:25.015 --> 01:35:26.679
TALIESIN: All of them. They're all gone.

01:35:26.679 --> 01:35:30.251
LIAM: There you are.

01:35:30.251 --> 01:35:33.252
LAURA: It's different when you're surrounded by
crazy things, but now that we're out in the

01:35:33.252 --> 01:35:34.301
normal--

01:35:34.301 --> 01:35:38.883
LIAM: Who is this person, now that I have a
moment?

01:35:38.883 --> 01:35:41.329
TALIESIN: You're staring, and he looks really
familiar.

01:35:41.329 --> 01:35:43.160
TRAVIS: Of course!

01:35:43.160 --> 01:35:46.348
TALIESIN: Will Friedle was out--

01:35:46.348 --> 01:35:49.812
TRAVIS: You killed Will Friedle!

01:35:49.812 --> 01:35:53.843
TALIESIN: Will didn't even have the moment of
seeing your face. He never even saw what

01:35:53.843 --> 01:35:54.738
happened.

01:35:54.738 --> 01:35:59.178
LIAM: I'm shoving him down through the toilet
seat, in, in, in.

01:35:59.178 --> 01:36:01.456
LAURA: You can't shove a whole body into the--!

01:36:01.456 --> 01:36:06.740
TALIESIN: Actually, I assure you that an entire
body can fit in there. Don't ask me how I know.

01:36:06.740 --> 01:36:08.848
LAURA: But what if the poo is stacked really
high?

01:36:08.848 --> 01:36:12.166
TALIESIN: It's not, thankfully. There's no
concert. It's not that bad.

01:36:12.166 --> 01:36:13.652
LIAM: Friedle is into the blue.

01:36:13.652 --> 01:36:16.369
TALIESIN: You have pressed Will beneath the
fluids.

01:36:16.369 --> 01:36:18.026
LAURA: Gross.

01:36:18.026 --> 01:36:24.026
LIAM: Will, what are you doing here, really? What
are you doing here? I don't care. I feel so good.

01:36:24.026 --> 01:36:26.421
Being a vampire is the fucking best!

01:36:26.421 --> 01:36:28.646
TRAVIS: What do you think Liam's doing?

01:36:28.646 --> 01:36:30.819
SAM: I'm sure he's just looking for someone.

01:36:30.819 --> 01:36:36.606
TALIESIN: Yeah, the lizards are trying to usher
you guys out of the cemetery.

01:36:36.606 --> 01:36:38.319
SAM: We're going to hunt.

01:36:38.319 --> 01:36:39.824
TALIESIN: You're going to hunt while you're in the
cemetery?

01:36:39.824 --> 01:36:44.924
SAM: I'm going to circle around somebody and try
to drive them to Travis.

01:36:44.924 --> 01:36:48.187
TRAVIS: Or, you know, you're also super charming.
You could just--

01:36:48.187 --> 01:36:49.863
TALIESIN: Are you in your Pac-Man suit? No, you're
not. Never mind.

01:36:49.863 --> 01:36:53.599
TRAVIS: You've got a trustworthy face.

01:36:53.599 --> 01:36:56.037
SAM: I've got fangs! Do I have fangs?

01:36:56.037 --> 01:37:00.456
TRAVIS: Maybe ask if somebody will take a picture
of us over by this crypt, you know? Like we're

01:37:00.456 --> 01:37:01.530
visiting.

01:37:01.530 --> 01:37:06.625
SAM: Okay. All right, Laura, come with me. Act
like my girlfriend or something. We're going to go

01:37:06.625 --> 01:37:09.511
talk to those people and push them toward Travis.

01:37:09.511 --> 01:37:10.564
LAURA: Okay.

01:37:10.564 --> 01:37:12.738
SAM: Are there any people around?

01:37:12.738 --> 01:37:18.728
TALIESIN: There are definitely people around.
They're all over the place. Are you going to go

01:37:18.728 --> 01:37:19.805
wander?

01:37:19.805 --> 01:37:24.719
SAM: Is there anyone who looks stout or like they
have a lot of blood in them?

01:37:24.719 --> 01:37:27.758
TALIESIN: They all look pretty juicy, I suppose.

01:37:27.758 --> 01:37:32.491
SAM: Is there anyone standing alone-ish or lagging
behind their group?

01:37:32.491 --> 01:37:35.636
TALIESIN: No, there's groups of people, at the
moment, hanging out together.

01:37:35.636 --> 01:37:36.809
LAURA: Anyone we recognize?

01:37:36.809 --> 01:37:40.162
TALIESIN: Who wants to look for people they
recognize?

01:37:40.162 --> 01:37:43.944
SAM: Yeah, me too. I'm looking for tourists
specifically.

01:37:43.944 --> 01:37:47.583
TALIESIN: Yeah, I don't know. I don't feel like
tourists go to Hollywood cemetery, but I'm into

01:37:47.583 --> 01:37:50.252
it. Do a perception awareness.

01:37:50.252 --> 01:38:01.121
LAURA: Four successes.

01:38:01.121 --> 01:38:03.913
SAM: Four successes.

01:38:03.913 --> 01:38:05.879
LIAM: Diplomatic immunity.

01:38:05.879 --> 01:38:14.520
TALIESIN: So, yeah, nobody you recognize off the
top of your head, but there's a small, obviously

01:38:14.520 --> 01:38:19.157
low-key film shoot happening in the corner.
Somebody's shooting some bullshit YouTube shit.

01:38:19.157 --> 01:38:24.894
And I swear to god, it looks like it's Mike Diva
and Manzi's definitely there. A couple people that

01:38:24.894 --> 01:38:26.311
you definitely recognize.

01:38:26.311 --> 01:38:28.311
LAURA: Oh my god, wait! I know those guys!

01:38:28.311 --> 01:38:29.507
SAM: Let's not kill them.

01:38:29.507 --> 01:38:35.240
LAURA: No, but I have a feeling. I feel like Mike
is just crazy enough that he'd be down for this.

01:38:35.240 --> 01:38:38.351
SAM: Like, if we tell him we're vampires, come let
us drink your blood?

01:38:38.351 --> 01:38:40.102
LAURA: I'm going to go talk to Mike for a second.

01:38:40.102 --> 01:38:41.196
SAM: I'm going to come with.

01:38:41.196 --> 01:38:44.638
LAURA: Hey, okay, let's go. Hi, Mike.

01:38:44.638 --> 01:38:46.352
TALIESIN: "Hey, oh, Laura! Hey!"

01:38:46.352 --> 01:38:48.294
LAURA: What's up? I know it's been a while.

01:38:48.294 --> 01:38:52.856
TALIESIN: "I know! I know I didn't call you for
the shoot."

01:38:52.856 --> 01:38:57.218
LAURA: No, totally fine, you know, there's a bunch
of stuff going on. Have you seen what's happening

01:38:57.218 --> 01:38:58.782
over at Geek &amp; Sundry?

01:38:58.782 --> 01:39:00.918
TALIESIN: "I mean, I've been really busy."

01:39:00.918 --> 01:39:06.251
LAURA: I totally understand. Hey. I have a quick
question for you.

01:39:06.251 --> 01:39:08.072
TALIESIN: "Are you doing a shoot? You've got,
like, a whole--"

01:39:08.072 --> 01:39:09.394
SAM: Yeah, we're doing a shoot.

01:39:09.394 --> 01:39:11.136
LAURA: We're doing a vampire shoot.

01:39:11.136 --> 01:39:13.440
TALIESIN: "That's cool. I've done that. That's
cool."

01:39:13.440 --> 01:39:20.532
LAURA: Yeah, it's pretty tight. Ti-ti-tight. You
want to say hi to Travis? He's over here.

01:39:20.532 --> 01:39:23.396
TALIESIN: "I mean, yeah. I mean, we're a little
busy."

01:39:23.396 --> 01:39:28.754
LAURA: I know you're busy, but dude. I really
think you want to see him.

01:39:28.754 --> 01:39:36.188
TALIESIN: "Are we-- do we got--?" Do you want to
try and--? Give me a charisma persuasion.

01:39:36.188 --> 01:39:37.893
LIAM: Do it.

01:39:37.893 --> 01:39:41.224
TALIESIN: I'm so sorry, Mike.

01:39:41.224 --> 01:39:43.708
LIAM: Didn't apologize to Friedle.

01:39:43.708 --> 01:39:45.012
TALIESIN: No.

01:39:45.012 --> 01:39:52.392
SAM: Don't forget blood. Oh, that's a lot.
Taliesin's brother thinks you're pretty

01:39:52.392 --> 01:39:53.466
charismatic.

01:39:53.466 --> 01:39:54.533
TALIESIN: Yes, he does.

01:39:54.533 --> 01:39:59.175
LAURA: One, two. Just two successes, but no--
well, yeah. No ones at all.

01:39:59.175 --> 01:40:07.605
TALIESIN: "Yeah, you guys can reset this. Yeah,
I've got a second, all right. Show me what you

01:40:07.605 --> 01:40:09.077
"guys are working on. That's cool."

01:40:09.077 --> 01:40:11.054
LAURA: Yeah! I mean, I really think you'll be
interested in this.

01:40:11.054 --> 01:40:14.008
TALIESIN: Yeah, he's into it. Honestly, he's
already pulling out his vape pen.

01:40:14.008 --> 01:40:20.891
LAURA: So we're going to make small talk on the
way back over, like, I was wondering if you had

01:40:20.891 --> 01:40:22.948
any Pickleback stuff, because I have been
craving--

01:40:22.948 --> 01:40:25.188
SAM: What is it? Pickleback? What's that?

01:40:25.188 --> 01:40:28.043
LAURA: It's a whiskey shot with pickle juice as
a chaser.

01:40:28.043 --> 01:40:31.940
TALIESIN: I haven't had time to have any fun
lately.

01:40:31.940 --> 01:40:33.211
SAM: I'm Sam, by the way. It's nice to meet you.

01:40:33.211 --> 01:40:34.158
LAURA: I'm so sorry, I didn't--

01:40:34.158 --> 01:40:36.234
SAM: I do stuff with her on Critical Role.

01:40:36.234 --> 01:40:39.659
TALIESIN: "That's cool, you're on the Critical
Role thing too? I hear that's cool."

01:40:39.659 --> 01:40:41.029
SAM: It's a dumb show.

01:40:41.029 --> 01:40:43.977
LAURA: We meet up with Travis. Hey, Travis, look!

01:40:43.977 --> 01:40:45.225
TALIESIN: "Hey, what's up, man?"

01:40:45.225 --> 01:40:48.370
LAURA: Our shoot is right around the corner here!
And we take him around the side of the

01:40:48.370 --> 01:40:54.708
crypt. But don't kill him!

01:40:54.708 --> 01:40:58.340
SAM: I'm going to get down on my hands and knees
for one of those push-over things.

01:40:58.340 --> 01:41:05.957
LAURA: No, here's the thing! No! Mike's cool with
it!

01:41:05.957 --> 01:41:07.316
SAM: Push him over!

01:41:07.316 --> 01:41:17.805
LAURA: Look, Mike, I have a proposition for you.
Have you ever met a vampire?

01:41:17.805 --> 01:41:19.052
TALIESIN: "Yes."

01:41:19.052 --> 01:41:20.695
LAURA: Have they ever sucked your blood?

01:41:20.695 --> 01:41:21.767
TALIESIN: "Yeah."

01:41:21.767 --> 01:41:23.725
LAURA: Would you be willing to go for that again?

01:41:23.725 --> 01:41:28.004
TALIESIN: "Do I get to be a vampire?"

01:41:28.004 --> 01:41:30.459
LAURA: No, you get to be sucked.

01:41:30.459 --> 01:41:33.828
SAM: Push him over!

01:41:33.828 --> 01:41:39.855
TALIESIN: "No, no, no! We can work! Okay, I can
make you a deal. We can do a deal with this. This

01:41:39.855 --> 01:41:48.310
"is not my first rodeo. It's Hollywood, I've been
around. You got one round, but I want to be a

01:41:48.310 --> 01:41:51.518
"vampire. You got to work that out."

01:41:51.518 --> 01:41:55.912
LAURA: That happens post-bite.

01:41:55.912 --> 01:41:59.820
TALIESIN: You do some work for me, I'm going to do
some work for you.

01:41:59.820 --> 01:42:04.487
TRAVIS: I've seen the movies. I'm going to drain
you to life's edge, and then I'll open up my wrist

01:42:04.487 --> 01:42:05.931
and give you a little--

01:42:05.931 --> 01:42:07.949
SAM: Like on True Blood.

01:42:07.949 --> 01:42:10.565
LAURA: Yeah, that's how they did in Interview,
too.

01:42:10.565 --> 01:42:13.113
TALIESIN: "You know, I don't actually know where
you guys are sitting--"

01:42:13.113 --> 01:42:14.865
TRAVIS: I grab him and I throw him into the
crypt.

01:42:14.865 --> 01:42:17.276
(laughter)

01:42:17.276 --> 01:42:18.122
TALIESIN: "Whoa!"

01:42:18.122 --> 01:42:19.476
LAURA: Be nice about it!

01:42:19.476 --> 01:42:23.628
TRAVIS: I take his chin and I go, sorry, Mike! And
I smash his head against the back of the crypt.

01:42:23.628 --> 01:42:27.054
LAURA: What are you doing?! He said he was cool
with it!

01:42:27.054 --> 01:42:29.399
TRAVIS: I'm fucking tired of your bullshit!
(snarling)

01:42:29.399 --> 01:42:40.600
TALIESIN: You going for it? All right, give me a
strength brawl plus two. Make a perception roll.

01:42:40.600 --> 01:42:42.479
Perception awareness.

01:42:42.479 --> 01:42:47.507
TRAVIS: Five successes, no failures.

01:42:47.507 --> 01:42:52.652
TALIESIN: Ooh, how much do you want to drain him?

01:42:52.652 --> 01:42:54.104
TRAVIS: All the way.

01:42:54.104 --> 01:42:55.867
LAURA: No, you're going to kill Mike?!

01:42:55.867 --> 01:42:59.534
TALIESIN: You're going to destroy my favorite
YouTube channel like that? With no--?

01:42:59.534 --> 01:43:01.274
TRAVIS: Well, yeah.

01:43:01.274 --> 01:43:07.625
LAURA: I rolled three successes. Do I see it
happening? I'm going to try and stop him.

01:43:07.625 --> 01:43:08.841
TALIESIN: You're going to try and stop him?

01:43:08.841 --> 01:43:11.390
SAM: Vampire on vampire fight?

01:43:11.390 --> 01:43:14.468
TALIESIN: All right, really quickly, I need to
double check this.

01:43:14.468 --> 01:43:21.705
LAURA: I love you! (sobbing) No!

01:43:21.705 --> 01:43:25.036
TALIESIN: What's your wits plus brawl?

01:43:25.036 --> 01:43:26.723
LAURA: Wits plus brawl?

01:43:26.723 --> 01:43:28.238
TALIESIN: I know that's weird.

01:43:28.238 --> 01:43:32.558
LAURA: Where's wits? It's six.

01:43:32.558 --> 01:43:34.618
TALIESIN: Six together? What's your wits plus
brawl?

01:43:34.618 --> 01:43:36.478
TRAVIS: Six.

01:43:36.478 --> 01:43:42.885
TALIESIN: Ooh, both roll a d10. One d10 each.

01:43:42.885 --> 01:43:45.595
LAURA: Did you get a ten?

01:43:45.595 --> 01:43:47.294
TRAVIS: No, I got a six.

01:43:47.294 --> 01:43:48.638
LAURA: I got a four.

01:43:48.638 --> 01:43:53.342
TALIESIN: You got a six, he got a four? He goes
before you, so he's going to at least get half of

01:43:53.342 --> 01:43:54.724
him drained before--

01:43:54.724 --> 01:43:58.887
LAURA: I want to jump on Travis' back before he
kills him.

01:43:58.887 --> 01:44:03.763
TALIESIN: You jump on his back after he's got--
half your blood pool is empty, and you can decide

01:44:03.763 --> 01:44:05.128
what you do about the--

01:44:05.128 --> 01:44:09.369
LAURA: Travis, don't kill Mike! Don't kill him,
he's human!

01:44:09.369 --> 01:44:15.429
TRAVIS: This is not what we want for our friends.
I'll take his head and--

01:44:15.429 --> 01:44:21.079
LAURA: No, no, Travis! Don't kill him! He's fine
with it! He said he was fine with it!

01:44:21.079 --> 01:44:23.009
TRAVIS: You want to make him a vampire?

01:44:23.009 --> 01:44:28.962
LAURA: No, I just don't want him to die! He knows
we're vampires, it's fine!

01:44:28.962 --> 01:44:30.179
TRAVIS: Okay.

01:44:30.179 --> 01:44:31.340
SAM: He's going to remember now.

01:44:31.340 --> 01:44:33.524
LAURA: No, seriously! I know you're saying okay, I
know you do that! And then you're going to snap

01:44:33.524 --> 01:44:34.501
his neck!

01:44:34.501 --> 01:44:37.502
SAM: I don't think Travis knows how to snap
someone's neck. That's a video game thing.

01:44:37.502 --> 01:44:39.244
LAURA: No, he totally would know.

01:44:39.244 --> 01:44:43.312
SAM: How would he know how to snap someone's--?
That's hard to do!

01:44:43.312 --> 01:44:44.865
TALIESIN: This is so dark!

01:44:44.865 --> 01:44:46.816
LIAM: Have you been around the last five
years?

01:44:46.816 --> 01:44:51.157
SAM: I'm sure you've seen it in movies, but it
doesn't just happen like that!

01:44:51.157 --> 01:44:53.196
LAURA: It's really hard to do, I know.

01:44:53.196 --> 01:44:55.370
TRAVIS: So what, you want us to leave him in
here?

01:44:55.370 --> 01:44:57.393
LAURA: No, just wake him up! He's fine!

01:44:57.393 --> 01:45:00.031
TRAVIS: We should walk him back to Manzi.

01:45:00.031 --> 01:45:04.031
LAURA: You want to bite Manzi?

01:45:04.031 --> 01:45:05.650
TRAVIS: Well, how many of these did I get rid of?

01:45:05.650 --> 01:45:08.047
TALIESIN: You can honestly, how hungry were you?

01:45:08.047 --> 01:45:09.575
TRAVIS: I was four blood.

01:45:09.575 --> 01:45:12.588
TALIESIN: I'll say you got three out of your
system.

01:45:12.588 --> 01:45:17.505
LAURA: See, you're fine. We can't get rid of the
last one without killing something. Don't worry

01:45:17.505 --> 01:45:18.466
about it.

01:45:18.466 --> 01:45:21.051
TRAVIS: Fine.

01:45:21.051 --> 01:45:34.271
LAURA: Thank you. Just wake him up and tell him
he's going to be a vampire soon. Mike, Mike! How

01:45:34.271 --> 01:45:35.799
are you?

01:45:35.799 --> 01:45:38.873
TRAVIS: Actually, I pick his head up and I feel
around on the back side. How's the back of the head?

01:45:38.873 --> 01:45:44.024
TALIESIN: He's got a little bump on the head, but
he had just taken a serious vape.

01:45:44.024 --> 01:45:46.617
LAURA: Mike, you fell over! You passed out!

01:45:46.617 --> 01:45:49.901
TALIESIN: "Oh, you totally bit me! Oh!"

01:45:49.901 --> 01:45:51.605
LAURA: You said you wanted us to!

01:45:51.605 --> 01:45:54.380
TALIESIN: "Give some warning, man! Oh god!"

01:45:54.380 --> 01:46:00.841
LAURA: That's how you turn into a vampire. So be
ready. You're probably going to turn in the next

01:46:00.841 --> 01:46:01.950
few days.

01:46:01.950 --> 01:46:11.451
TALIESIN: "I'm going to go back to my shoot."

01:46:11.451 --> 01:46:13.972
LAURA: Yeah, they've been looking for you, I
think.

01:46:13.972 --> 01:46:19.274
TALIESIN: "Yeah, you guys need to figure your shit
out. Jesus."

01:46:19.274 --> 01:46:20.302
LAURA: Have a fun shoot!

01:46:20.302 --> 01:46:24.601
TALIESIN: "Argh, ow. God."

01:46:24.601 --> 01:46:26.389
TRAVIS: Sorry, Mike. Nothing personal.

01:46:26.389 --> 01:46:29.983
TALIESIN: "Dude, not cool. Not cool."

01:46:29.983 --> 01:46:35.886
TRAVIS: You made me feel bad. You get to kill
random Smart Girl people, and Mike gets away.

01:46:35.886 --> 01:46:40.923
LAURA: It's like I said, when we were in the
offices, everything was weird, and it seemed okay,

01:46:40.923 --> 01:46:43.160
and now that we're out there's humans around!

01:46:43.160 --> 01:46:44.897
TRAVIS: It's okay for you, just not cool for other
people, huh?

01:46:44.897 --> 01:46:47.560
SAM: Well, I mean, all of us have killed except
for you, at this point.

01:46:47.560 --> 01:46:48.921
TRAVIS: Yeah, pretty much.

01:46:48.921 --> 01:46:53.778
LIAM: I come waltzing up. Oh my god, I just did a
bump of Friedle. I mean, I just bumped into

01:46:53.778 --> 01:46:59.112
Friedle. It's crazy, the odds. Yeah! He's here!

01:46:59.112 --> 01:47:00.435
TRAVIS: Is he a vampire?

01:47:00.435 --> 01:47:03.616
LIAM: No, he is not a vampire. He had to go.

01:47:03.616 --> 01:47:06.192
TRAVIS: He had to leave? He couldn't say hi to us
first?

01:47:06.192 --> 01:47:08.287
LIAM: (sucking noise)

01:47:08.287 --> 01:47:09.741
LAURA: Oh, that's creepy.

01:47:09.741 --> 01:47:11.220
SAM: You killed Will Friedle.

01:47:11.220 --> 01:47:12.529
TRAVIS: Did you leave him alive?

01:47:12.529 --> 01:47:14.294
LIAM: Sure.

01:47:14.294 --> 01:47:16.482
SAM: I feel like we've taken a plunge here.

01:47:16.482 --> 01:47:21.010
LAURA: You have poop on you. I can smell poop on
you.

01:47:21.010 --> 01:47:22.517
TRAVIS: We're really supposed to be meeting up
with someone.

01:47:22.517 --> 01:47:25.625
TALIESIN: Kotori and Mahlo are looking at you guys
a little like--

01:47:25.625 --> 01:47:28.523
TRAVIS: We told you we were new. Sorry. We're just
trying to flush this out.

01:47:28.523 --> 01:47:31.018
LAURA: God, I'm so sorry you had to witness all of
this.

01:47:31.018 --> 01:47:35.193
TRAVIS: Enough delays. We should really go. We
have a promise to keep.

01:47:35.193 --> 01:47:40.799
TALIESIN: "Totes. We'll take you to where you need
to go." And we're going to take a break while we

01:47:40.799 --> 01:47:48.324
take a gentle stroll to Los Globos. That got so
weird. I'm so pleased. I hope, now that Mike has

01:47:48.324 --> 01:47:51.981
survived, I hope you all take a moment to go check
out his YouTube channel. It's quite

01:47:51.981 --> 01:47:58.509
pleasing. Mike Diva. Thank you guys, we'll be back
in a few minutes. There's also going to be a

01:47:58.509 --> 01:48:03.445
giveaway in the chat, but I think that's all going
to be in the little video. There's going to be a

01:48:03.445 --> 01:48:07.738
video about the password. Otherwise, we have
dice.

01:48:07.738 --> 01:48:09.078
LAURA: And we have coasters.

01:48:09.078 --> 01:48:15.701
TALIESIN: Coasters, and thank you Tor Books. We
will continue with this madness when we come back

01:48:15.701 --> 01:48:19.984
from a little bit of a snack. Cake.

01:48:19.984 --> 02:08:52.338
[break]

02:08:54.566 --> 02:08:57.506
TALIESIN: That's a lie. The cake is a lie.

02:08:57.525 --> 02:08:59.087
LAURA: It was so good.

02:08:59.118 --> 02:09:03.720
TALIESIN: It was actually a really good cake! I
feel a little guilty for eating it. The winner, by

02:09:03.720 --> 02:09:13.873
the way, of our contest in the chat room was
Sharpe_liquid. Sharpe liquid. Congratulations!

02:09:13.893 --> 02:09:20.502
That's a great little call sign. That's pretty
cool. I hope you guys are enjoying this

02:09:20.502 --> 02:09:23.950
ridiculousness. I had to take some layers off
because it's really hot!

02:09:25.650 --> 02:09:28.166
LIAM: Ridiculous! This is very serious.

02:09:28.166 --> 02:09:30.446
TALIESIN: So serious. This is super, super
serious.

02:09:30.456 --> 02:09:31.833
SAM: (loud burp)

02:09:31.843 --> 02:09:33.991
LAURA: Wow! Did you feel better?

02:09:33.991 --> 02:09:37.658
SAM: Yep. Sorry.

02:09:37.668 --> 02:09:39.704
LAURA: Let's do this.

02:09:39.704 --> 02:09:41.023
TALIESIN: Are we doing this?

02:09:41.023 --> 02:09:43.787
LIAM: The eyebrows though...

02:09:43.787 --> 02:09:54.142
TALIESIN: (Pac-Man noises) So where were we?
That's right, let me get my volume back up.

02:09:54.142 --> 02:09:57.562
TRAVIS: We were just about to kill Mike Diva.

02:09:57.562 --> 02:09:59.280
LAURA: No, Mike Diva's alive.

02:09:59.280 --> 02:10:04.629
TALIESIN: Can't kill Mike Diva. Mika Diva's got to
do his thing, man. There's no stopping Mike Diva.

02:10:04.629 --> 02:10:06.995
TRAVIS: You get one.

02:10:06.995 --> 02:10:10.980
TALIESIN: No, there is definitely some stopping
Will Friedle. You can leave Will Friedle at the

02:10:10.980 --> 02:10:13.741
bottom of the blue tank.

02:10:13.741 --> 02:10:15.464
LIAM: Marinating right now.

02:10:15.464 --> 02:10:17.121
TALIESIN: Slowly dissolving.

02:10:17.121 --> 02:10:19.830
LAURA: I hope we make it out of LA before people
find his body.

02:10:19.830 --> 02:10:22.047
LIAM: Who's going to find it?

02:10:22.047 --> 02:10:24.785
LAURA: The cleaners. The porta potty cleaners.

02:10:24.785 --> 02:10:26.642
LIAM: You don't know about his body.

02:10:26.642 --> 02:10:32.957
TALIESIN: They are going to find his body. That is
going to be a problem for another game. It's

02:10:32.957 --> 02:10:37.264
somebody else's Vampire game is going to run into
Will Friedle's body.

02:10:37.264 --> 02:10:38.845
LAURA: Do I have cake in my teeth?

02:10:38.845 --> 02:10:41.074
SAM: Nope. You got other stuff, but not cake.

02:10:41.074 --> 02:10:49.140
TALIESIN: So we had left the cemetery and its
roving hipsters and film crews and Will Friedle.

02:10:49.140 --> 02:10:56.786
We're slowly making our way through the city, up
to--

02:10:56.786 --> 02:11:03.002
TRAVIS: I just realized Liam has the habit of
killing NPCs before they ever utter a word. Well,

02:11:03.002 --> 02:11:05.020
I guess he protested through the door.

02:11:05.020 --> 02:11:11.882
TALIESIN: This is why every person that we know
who I know I can't do an impression of, I just

02:11:11.882 --> 02:11:17.423
introduce them to Liam and I know it's never going
to be a problem. Should have just given you Mary

02:11:17.423 --> 02:11:24.268
Elizabeth, that would have just been easy peasy,
because I can't do that. We make our way slowly up

02:11:24.268 --> 02:11:35.813
to Sunset Boulevard, where you are brought to the
door of Los Globos, a skeezy-looking club. It's

02:11:35.813 --> 02:11:39.655
maybe two, three stories. It's hard to tell. It's
built into a hill. It's hard to get an idea of the

02:11:39.655 --> 02:11:46.457
place. You can't tell how big it is, really. It's
just got a big red fiery sign that says "Los

02:11:46.918 --> 02:11:50.487
Globos" on the front and there's a doorman in
there.

02:11:50.516 --> 02:11:51.919
LAURA: Is he a vampire?

02:11:52.663 --> 02:11:53.586
TALIESIN: You don't know.

02:11:54.218 --> 02:11:54.999
LAURA: You can't tell?

02:11:55.065 --> 02:11:56.456
TALIESIN: You can't tell. I could tell.

02:11:56.478 --> 02:11:57.498
LIAM: What's Los Globos?

02:11:57.677 --> 02:11:59.665
LAURA: It's a club where vampires are!

02:11:59.671 --> 02:12:00.792
LIAM: But what does it mean?

02:12:00.811 --> 02:12:01.985
LAURA: The globes?

02:12:02.227 --> 02:12:04.589
SAM: The balls, the balloons. Something like that.

02:12:05.410 --> 02:12:07.147
LIAM: G.L.A.B.O.S.?

02:12:08.169 --> 02:12:10.726
TRAVIS: I would like to use Google Translate.

02:12:11.951 --> 02:12:15.588
TALIESIN: You don't have a phone, man. You could
have taken Diva's phone, but you didn't think

02:12:15.588 --> 02:12:16.723
about that, did you?

02:12:16.723 --> 02:12:17.728
LAURA: Oh, that would have been so smart!

02:12:18.114 --> 02:12:18.936
TRAVIS: What about my iWatch?

02:12:18.940 --> 02:12:25.041
TALIESIN: Man, they took all your good shit before
they put you in anything in order to stay. Lock

02:12:25.057 --> 02:12:36.367
and Mahlo take a second and show you inside. Lock
comes forward. "The ones you're looking for are

02:12:36.367 --> 02:12:39.272
inside. Good luck."

02:12:39.297 --> 02:12:43.657
SAM: What are they? What kind of creature are
they? Are they vampires?

02:12:43.657 --> 02:12:44.948
TALIESIN: "Vampires."

02:12:44.956 --> 02:12:46.206
SAM: And what are their names?

02:12:46.206 --> 02:12:47.126
TALIESIN: "I don't know."

02:12:47.126 --> 02:12:49.651
SAM: How will we know it's them?

02:12:49.651 --> 02:12:56.950
TALIESIN: "Good luck." And they peace out. They
are out and leaving you to your own devices here.

02:12:56.950 --> 02:12:58.979
TRAVIS: Are we inside or are we outside the club?

02:12:58.979 --> 02:13:03.797
TALIESIN: You're currently outside, although the
bouncer inside has witnessed enough of this and

02:13:03.797 --> 02:13:11.049
seems deeply unimpressed by two lizard people
having this conversation, that he's just sitting

02:13:11.049 --> 02:13:13.010
with his clicker, waiting for you guys to walk
in.

02:13:13.010 --> 02:13:14.648
LAURA: I smile at him.

02:13:14.648 --> 02:13:16.145
SAM: We don't have IDs.

02:13:16.145 --> 02:13:19.561
LAURA: I'm trying to make you smile back at me.

02:13:19.561 --> 02:13:22.365
TALIESIN: "You don't need IDs. You're fine."

02:13:22.365 --> 02:13:24.552
SAM: Because we look old.

02:13:24.552 --> 02:13:32.734
TALIESIN: "You do, yeah." Click. Click.

02:13:32.734 --> 02:13:34.521
TRAVIS: At the door? Then we go right in?

02:13:34.521 --> 02:13:37.691
TALIESIN: Yeah. The lizard people brought you in.

02:13:37.691 --> 02:13:39.336
LAURA: Did he smile at us?

02:13:39.336 --> 02:13:40.273
TALIESIN: Nah.

02:13:40.273 --> 02:13:41.560
LAURA: Damn it.

02:13:41.560 --> 02:13:43.216
SAM: We don't have any money. We can't buy
anything in here.

02:13:43.216 --> 02:13:44.072
TALIESIN: No.

02:13:44.072 --> 02:13:46.023
LAURA: I don't think we're trying to get drunk,
Sam.

02:13:46.023 --> 02:13:47.890
SAM: Well, I don't know. To fit in?

02:13:47.890 --> 02:13:58.020
TALIESIN: You walk through a pretty scummy
hallway. It's definitely sticky in here and it's

02:13:58.020 --> 02:13:59.620
dark and there's some thumping music.

02:13:59.620 --> 02:14:01.141
TRAVIS: Hemoglobin sticky or alcohol sticky?

02:14:01.141 --> 02:14:02.337
TALIESIN: Alcohol sticky.

02:14:02.337 --> 02:14:07.958
LAURA: It's like a Blade club where they bring
humans in and then when the music hits, then

02:14:07.958 --> 02:14:09.397
everybody gets bit?

02:14:09.397 --> 02:14:13.681
SAM: I never understood why would anyone go into
those clubs if people were dying all the time.

02:14:13.681 --> 02:14:20.341
TALIESIN: Because that's just the best club. There
is for reasons of a) that I don't want you

02:14:20.341 --> 02:14:24.420
screaming over each other and b) finding music
that I could have used on short notice is just

02:14:24.420 --> 02:14:30.618
ridiculous, there is thumping, dropping industrial
music in this club. There are people dancing.

02:14:30.618 --> 02:14:32.751
LAURA: I start dancing.

02:14:32.751 --> 02:14:39.036
TALIESIN: It's definitely a goth industrial club.
There's some hairstyles, there's multicolored

02:14:39.036 --> 02:14:44.097
hair. There's a lot of people wearing black
clothing. There is a lot of lights and laser

02:14:44.097 --> 02:14:50.451
effects. There's a DJ doing his job, who's a
little old and craggily. And there is nothing you

02:14:50.451 --> 02:14:53.219
recognize off the top of your head, but it looks
like a decent goth club.

02:14:53.219 --> 02:14:55.414
LIAM: Can I get a drink out of habit?

02:14:55.452 --> 02:14:57.199
SAM and LAURA: We have no money.

02:14:57.199 --> 02:15:00.998
LIAM: We don't? There's nothing in my pants
anymore?

02:15:00.998 --> 02:15:02.866
LAURA: No, they took all of our stuff.

02:15:02.866 --> 02:15:03.963
LIAM: Just all my shit?

02:15:03.963 --> 02:15:08.275
SAM: We can barter some blood or something. I
don't know. Maybe you could convince him with your charms!

02:15:08.275 --> 02:15:11.709
LAURA: Maybe, check and see if the bartender is a
vampire.

02:15:11.709 --> 02:15:18.195
SAM: Are there ladies on the dance floor?

02:15:18.195 --> 02:15:20.854
TALIESIN: There are men, women and definitely--

02:15:20.854 --> 02:15:22.712
TRAVIS: I'll look for a VIP area.

02:15:22.712 --> 02:15:24.399
TALIESIN: You want to look for a VIP area?

02:15:24.399 --> 02:15:26.209
LAURA: I'm gonna dance too. I'm definitely dancing
too.

02:15:26.209 --> 02:15:32.478
TALIESIN: You got to watch my guide to goth
dancing. You're doing fine but that's okay. You're

02:15:32.478 --> 02:15:34.212
doing the Pac-Man. That's cool.

02:15:34.212 --> 02:15:36.135
SAM: Glow-sticks.

02:15:36.135 --> 02:15:39.741
TALIESIN: Give me a perception awareness roll for
the VIP lounge.

02:15:39.741 --> 02:15:41.241
TRAVIS: Okay.

02:15:41.241 --> 02:15:45.951
TALIESIN: If you're thinking about how you're
going to get a drink, I'm fascinated.

02:15:45.951 --> 02:15:48.443
LIAM: I'll just say, hey, how's the night going?

02:15:48.443 --> 02:15:58.174
TALIESIN: "It's fine. Yeah." So you know, guy in
his mid-30s, short haircut, black t-shirt.

02:15:58.174 --> 02:16:02.406
Obviously he's probably here five nights a week
and for five different clubs.

02:16:02.406 --> 02:16:08.260
LIAM: Jeez, you have a big smile. I know that's
weird to say.

02:16:08.295 --> 02:16:09.525
TALIESIN: "Yeah."

02:16:09.525 --> 02:16:10.922
TRAVIS: You've never been in a bar before.

02:16:10.922 --> 02:16:13.995
(laughter)

02:16:13.995 --> 02:16:20.035
LIAM: No, I have a friend with a, it's dumb, but a
huge smile. Like teeth as big as the Hollywood

02:16:20.148 --> 02:16:21.497
sign. Gorgeous.

02:16:21.497 --> 02:16:25.349
TALIESIN: "Yeah. Can I get you something?"

02:16:25.349 --> 02:16:27.108
LIAM: Yeah, what's good tonight?

02:16:27.108 --> 02:16:29.415
LAURA: The alcohol!

02:16:29.415 --> 02:16:35.903
TALIESIN: "Beer on tap. We do a couple absinthe
drinks, but they're overpriced. What do you want?"

02:16:35.903 --> 02:16:43.519
LIAM: Oh god. I would love an absinthe, but I lost
my wallet. I guess just beer on tap. Could I

02:16:43.519 --> 02:16:44.912
leave a card?

02:16:44.912 --> 02:16:46.801
TALIESIN: "Yep. Card and ID?"

02:16:46.801 --> 02:16:52.533
LIAM: God, I don't have that. God, I am up shit
creek.

02:16:52.533 --> 02:16:56.011
LAURA: Can you imagine if somebody walked up to the
bartender doing this shit? He'd be like, get

02:16:56.011 --> 02:16:56.839
the fuck out.

02:16:56.839 --> 02:17:01.977
TALIESIN: I have seen weirder interactions with
bartenders. This is nowhere near the weirdest

02:17:01.977 --> 02:17:03.061
interaction.

02:17:03.061 --> 02:17:05.674
LIAM: It's no question that the three of you want
me to fail. It's fine. I'm used to it.

02:17:05.674 --> 02:17:09.123
TALIESIN: I don't want you to fail! Are you going
to use Presence Awe?

02:17:09.123 --> 02:17:10.532
LIAM: Yes I am.

02:17:10.532 --> 02:17:16.880
TALIESIN: All right. Give me a 1d10 blood check
and then--

02:17:16.880 --> 02:17:20.317
LIAM: I'm used to it, Laura. Don't worry. Three.

02:17:20.317 --> 02:17:26.910
TALIESIN: Ooh, where did it go? Three. Where's my
blood pool? Yep, you get one hunger.

02:17:26.910 --> 02:17:30.763
LIAM: Okay, cool. Good thing I drained Friedle.

02:17:30.763 --> 02:17:34.974
TRAVIS: I had three successes on looking for the
VIP area.

02:17:34.974 --> 02:17:43.521
TALIESIN: Yes, you notice actually, in a gothic
red sign, there's a little velvet rope and a sign

02:17:43.521 --> 02:17:48.253
that reads, "Food is only served in the VIP
lounge."

02:17:48.253 --> 02:17:52.972
TRAVIS: Is there a bouncer?

02:17:52.972 --> 02:18:00.399
TALIESIN: There is a big bouncer. Very big, pale,
older-looking gentleman.

02:18:00.399 --> 02:18:08.518
TRAVIS: I'll walk up to him. We're supposed to meet
someone in here.

02:18:08.518 --> 02:18:11.939
TALIESIN: "You have a name on the list?"

02:18:11.939 --> 02:18:22.747
TRAVIS: We're probably not, but me and my three
friends are new to this scene. My name is Travis.

02:18:22.747 --> 02:18:30.678
TALIESIN: "Okay. Well, I would recommend getting
on the list."

02:18:30.678 --> 02:18:34.346
TRAVIS: How does one go about getting on the
list?

02:18:34.346 --> 02:18:35.973
TALIESIN: "I don't know, man."

02:18:35.973 --> 02:18:39.106
TRAVIS: Does he seem like a human?

02:18:39.106 --> 02:18:47.098
TALIESIN: Make an intelligence investigation
check. I'm going to get weird on this one. Give me

02:18:47.098 --> 02:18:48.920
intelligence occult.

02:18:48.920 --> 02:18:56.026
TRAVIS: One success, no failures.

02:18:56.026 --> 02:19:00.083
TALIESIN: You have no idea. He's big.

02:19:00.083 --> 02:19:06.368
TRAVIS: While I am standing at the rope talking to
this gentleman, can I look and see who I see in

02:19:06.368 --> 02:19:09.043
the VIP area? A lot of people, a few people?

02:19:09.043 --> 02:19:12.520
TALIESIN: It's up the stairs. It's a little hard
to see. You can't quite tell who's up there.

02:19:12.520 --> 02:19:18.267
There's a rope and then it goes upstairs and
there, it turns a corner. It's practically a

02:19:18.267 --> 02:19:19.660
different club.

02:19:19.660 --> 02:19:23.270
TRAVIS: Fantastic. I'll be back once we're on the
list. Thanks for your time. And I go find Sam.

02:19:23.270 --> 02:19:24.842
TALIESIN: "Good luck."

02:19:24.994 --> 02:19:27.455
LIAM: I never did Presence Awe. For getting
that hunger.

02:19:27.455 --> 02:19:29.765
TALIESIN: You've got to roll it now.

02:19:29.844 --> 02:19:33.149
LIAM: Yep, sure. Just one success, no failures.

02:19:33.149 --> 02:19:52.224
TALIESIN: He gives you a look over. "Are you sure
that this is the bar you want to be drinking at?"

02:19:52.224 --> 02:19:54.561
LIAM: Absolutely.

02:19:54.561 --> 02:20:03.537
TALIESIN: "Are you sure that you wouldn't rather
have something from the cocktail list?" Oh my god,

02:20:03.537 --> 02:20:09.728
dude. This dance battle is killing me.

02:20:09.728 --> 02:20:14.504
LIAM: I mean, I gotcha. That is what we're here
for. Do you see the guy over there with the

02:20:14.504 --> 02:20:17.720
gigantic smile that looks like Pac-Man with the
huge teeth? Yeah.

02:20:17.720 --> 02:20:19.181
TALIESIN: "It's hard to miss."

02:20:19.181 --> 02:20:23.837
LIAM: That's my guy. He was newly christened
tonight and the rest of us want to celebrate.

02:20:23.837 --> 02:20:31.181
TALIESIN: "Oh man, that's a lot of info. You
should probably be upstairs, man."

02:20:31.181 --> 02:20:33.128
LIAM: I do want to see the cocktail list.

02:20:33.128 --> 02:20:39.421
TALIESIN: "Yeah. You've got a name, just drop a
name at the front. They'll let you right in."

02:20:39.421 --> 02:20:45.145
LIAM: Just drop it at the front? Okay.

02:20:45.145 --> 02:20:47.422
TALIESIN: "Yeah, you're fine. You'll be fine, but
no trouble down here. We keep this clean."

02:20:47.422 --> 02:20:50.733
LIAM: Sure. All right. Could I get an Old
Fashioned? Would that be all right?

02:20:50.733 --> 02:20:53.288
TALIESIN: "Sure."

02:20:53.288 --> 02:20:56.247
LAURA: It's gonna taste like shit.

02:20:56.247 --> 02:20:59.712
TALIESIN: And he makes a club Old Fashioned.

02:20:59.712 --> 02:21:01.822
LIAM: Just for old times' sake.

02:21:01.822 --> 02:21:07.359
TALIESIN: What's muddled? He muddles the fruit,
like he just reminds it that it's ordinary and

02:21:07.359 --> 02:21:08.633
then hands it off.

02:21:08.633 --> 02:21:13.598
LIAM: Every once in a while, I remind myself what I
left behind. What does that taste like?

02:21:13.598 --> 02:21:24.814
TALIESIN: It tastes like gasoline. It's awful. It
burns. It doesn't feel good. It's petrol.

02:21:24.814 --> 02:21:26.862
LIAM: Yeah. Better off.

02:21:26.862 --> 02:21:30.010
LAURA: Sam and I have started line dancing.

02:21:30.010 --> 02:21:37.638
SAM: Wait, are there any young ladies on the dance
floor that I can maybe chat up?

02:21:37.638 --> 02:21:39.778
TALIESIN: You've never been to a goth club, have
you?

02:21:39.778 --> 02:21:40.891
SAM: Nope.

02:21:40.891 --> 02:21:42.872
TALIESIN: You can certainly try.

02:21:42.872 --> 02:21:52.837
SAM: I'll pick one and say: Excuse me! Hey. Excuse
me. Hey. Do you come here a lot?

02:21:52.837 --> 02:21:55.332
LIAM: Please tell me it's Lauryn Ipsum.

02:21:55.332 --> 02:22:06.789
TALIESIN: Oh man. Oh Lauryn, oh dear. It's a girl
with a large blue mohawk and a bunch of metal

02:22:06.789 --> 02:22:15.135
barbs tied into the large blue mohawk. She is
doing this heavy interpretive dance. She takes a

02:22:15.135 --> 02:22:18.169
look at you, spins around and an elbow goes right
into your chest.

02:22:18.169 --> 02:22:25.250
SAM: Does it stir anything in me? Do I have an
urge to kill her or anything like that?

02:22:25.250 --> 02:22:26.935
TALIESIN: What's your--

02:22:26.935 --> 02:22:28.314
SAM: One.

02:22:28.314 --> 02:22:30.718
TALIESIN: No. You're hungry, but you're fine.

02:22:30.718 --> 02:22:38.236
SAM: I'll continue. I'll spin her back around and
say, that was so hardcore!

02:22:38.236 --> 02:22:42.710
TALIESIN: Suddenly, a completely different elbow
ends up in your chest. From somebody else, there

02:22:42.710 --> 02:22:44.803
is another.

02:22:44.803 --> 02:22:47.716
SAM: This is not the Electric Slide I grew up
with!

02:22:47.716 --> 02:22:52.950
TALIESIN: There's a guy with long black hair and
he's wearing a little tie and a nice vest and

02:22:52.950 --> 02:22:55.208
suddenly another elbow is right in your
chest.

02:22:55.208 --> 02:23:01.809
LAURA: I walk over to Sam and be like: You just
don't. Trust me. Just don't.

02:23:01.809 --> 02:23:05.406
TALIESIN: And that's what happens when you try and
hit on people on the dance floor at a goth club.

02:23:05.406 --> 02:23:08.694
TRAVIS: I make my way over to Laura and Sam. I'm like,
Sam, I need your-- what are you doing?

02:23:08.788 --> 02:23:11.248
SAM: I'm working this girl right here. I think I'm
going to--

02:23:11.248 --> 02:23:13.524
TALIESIN: The girl turns to you and goes, "He's
really not."

02:23:13.614 --> 02:23:16.753
TRAVIS: My apologies. I pull him off the dance
floor with Laura.

02:23:16.753 --> 02:23:18.101
LAURA: Me too?

02:23:18.101 --> 02:23:23.814
TRAVIS: Yeah. So there is a VIP lounge but we
apparently need to be on the list. I don't know

02:23:23.814 --> 02:23:27.376
how to do that. You're fast as shit. How about I
distract or--

02:23:27.376 --> 02:23:28.865
SAM: Is there a clipboard list?

02:23:28.865 --> 02:23:30.539
TRAVIS: Maybe.

02:23:30.539 --> 02:23:32.245
LAURA: I could sneak past him!

02:23:32.245 --> 02:23:34.113
TALIESIN: You seem to recall he had an iPhone.

02:23:34.113 --> 02:23:43.820
SAM: Well, I could super-fast try to type one on
his iPhone, but that seems like he's going to

02:23:43.820 --> 02:23:45.661
catch me, right? I'm not that fast.

02:23:45.661 --> 02:23:48.038
TRAVIS: Or if there's a payphone at the bar we could
call and pretend to be--

02:23:48.038 --> 02:23:49.791
SAM: If you distract him, I could whiz by him.

02:23:49.791 --> 02:23:51.651
TRAVIS: She's also nigh-invisible.

02:23:51.651 --> 02:23:57.208
SAM: We could both. And then we could come out and be
like, hey, let our friends in.

02:23:57.208 --> 02:23:58.975
LAURA: Oh, our friends. Yeah, that's good.

02:23:58.975 --> 02:23:59.901
TRAVIS: I'll do that.

02:23:59.901 --> 02:24:01.637
SAM: Okay, how are you going to distract him?

02:24:01.637 --> 02:24:10.767
TRAVIS; I got it. So I walk back up to the bouncer
and I start in the normal roped area and I move to

02:24:10.767 --> 02:24:18.328
his opposite side so that he has to follow me with
his vision. The thing about fingers is you

02:24:18.328 --> 02:24:22.812
don't really need all of them. And I'll snap this
finger off. Just break it right there.

02:24:22.812 --> 02:24:24.440
LAURA: Why?

02:24:24.440 --> 02:24:25.613
TALIESIN: Can you do that?

02:24:25.613 --> 02:24:26.881
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:24:26.881 --> 02:24:28.319
TALIESIN: This is a trick or are you really doing
it?

02:24:28.319 --> 02:24:29.701
TRAVIS: I'm really breaking my own finger.

02:24:29.701 --> 02:24:39.927
TALIESIN: You just want me to say stanima, and I'm
going to do it for you. Stanima. Oh man, I'm going

02:24:39.927 --> 02:24:44.743
to add survival. I know that's weird, but I'm
adding survival to this. Stanima and survival.

02:24:44.743 --> 02:24:48.528
Stanima. I'm saying it.

02:24:48.528 --> 02:24:52.006
LAURA: I'm going to go over against the wall in
the dark and Obfuscate.

02:24:52.006 --> 02:24:53.670
TRAVIS: Three successes, no failures.

02:24:53.670 --> 02:24:58.077
TALIESIN: You're even doing the hands right. Yeah,
you do not even break eye contact with him, do you?

02:24:58.077 --> 02:24:59.938
TRAVIS: I'll just (cracking sound).

02:24:59.938 --> 02:25:05.075
TALIESIN: "Dude, what's wrong with you, man?"

02:25:05.075 --> 02:25:07.744
SAM: Is he distracted?

02:25:07.744 --> 02:25:09.416
TRAVIS: It normally stays--

02:25:09.416 --> 02:25:12.254
TALIESIN: He's definitely staring at a broken
finger.

02:25:12.254 --> 02:25:15.364
SAM: I'm going to wait and see if Laura
gets through before I dash.

02:25:15.364 --> 02:25:17.237
LAURA: You can't even see me.

02:25:17.237 --> 02:25:18.842
SAM: Oh. Well, that's why.

02:25:18.842 --> 02:25:20.902
TALIESIN: You're going to wait a while.

02:25:20.902 --> 02:25:22.139
LAURA: Can I try to go?

02:25:22.139 --> 02:25:23.216
TALIESIN: You can try to go.

02:25:23.216 --> 02:25:24.885
LAURA: And do I need to roll to Obfuscate?

02:25:24.885 --> 02:25:26.654
TALIESIN: Let me double-check, because--

02:25:26.654 --> 02:25:28.676
LAURA: I roll my hunger roll?

02:25:28.676 --> 02:25:31.806
TALIESIN: You got to roll a 1d10 and tell me what
you get.

02:25:31.806 --> 02:25:33.132
LAURA: Three.

02:25:33.132 --> 02:25:38.405
TALIESIN: You are now one more hunger die up, but
I think you could just do it. I'm just

02:25:38.405 --> 02:25:39.661
double-checking, because--

02:25:39.661 --> 02:25:41.892
LAURA: Hunger roll, wits and stealth.

02:25:41.892 --> 02:25:47.475
TALIESIN: Oh, now you have to roll wits and
stealth. Thank you, I was looking for that.

02:25:47.475 --> 02:25:50.399
LAURA: Like you do!

02:25:50.399 --> 02:25:58.343
SAM: What's going on under the Pac-Man suit? You
don't know.

02:25:58.343 --> 02:26:02.501
LAURA: Two successes.

02:26:02.501 --> 02:26:12.730
TALIESIN: He rolled really poorly and he was
pretty distracted. Yeah, you would have my

02:26:12.730 --> 02:26:16.495
undivided attention. I'm just saying that if you
broke a finger in front of me, I would not be

02:26:16.495 --> 02:26:17.936
looking at anything else.

02:26:17.936 --> 02:26:20.859
TRAVIS: I'm hoping that vampires have amazing
regenerative powers.

02:26:20.859 --> 02:26:27.983
TALIESIN: That's actually a good point. I think
you definitely have to take a point of damage, so

02:26:27.983 --> 02:26:30.994
just mark off that you just took a point of
damage.

02:26:30.994 --> 02:26:32.482
LAURA: Is that on your health?

02:26:32.482 --> 02:26:35.888
TALIESIN: Yeah, under the health bar. Just put a
line through one of those.

02:26:35.888 --> 02:26:39.356
LAURA: What is this health and humanity stuff that we
haven't even looked at yet?

02:26:39.356 --> 02:26:43.619
TALIESIN: Humanity, we're ignoring because it's
because I'm deciding that it's far more

02:26:43.619 --> 02:26:46.388
interesting to play with when you have a longer,
more complicated game.

02:26:46.388 --> 02:26:48.744
LIAM: Humanity is in the porta potty with Friedle
right now.

02:26:48.744 --> 02:26:50.504
TALIESIN: It's sadly, at the moment, we've dropped
humanity.

02:26:50.504 --> 02:26:52.525
SAM: Did I see Laura get through?

02:26:52.525 --> 02:26:56.503
TALIESIN: No. She's nigh invisible.

02:26:56.503 --> 02:26:59.062
SAM: Well then, is he still distracted?

02:26:59.062 --> 02:27:00.949
TALIESIN: He's still staring at a finger.

02:27:00.949 --> 02:27:02.386
SAM: I'm going to bolt past him.

02:27:02.386 --> 02:27:03.749
TALIESIN: All right. Roll a d10.

02:27:03.749 --> 02:27:06.031
SAM: Just 1d10? Two.

02:27:06.031 --> 02:27:07.390
TRAVIS: What if I pulled it out?

02:27:07.390 --> 02:27:08.718
TALIESIN: You got a hunger die.

02:27:08.718 --> 02:27:10.003
SAM: Don't worry, I have plenty over here.

02:27:10.003 --> 02:27:22.453
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, I'm throwing them out anyway as
it makes me feel excited. Let's do dexterity and

02:27:22.453 --> 02:27:24.830
dodge to see if you can get past this guy.

02:27:24.830 --> 02:27:26.366
SAM: Ooh, not good.

02:27:26.366 --> 02:27:27.651
TALIESIN: It's okay. He's distracted.

02:27:27.651 --> 02:27:35.183
SAM: Well okay, that's one roll. Oh wait, that has
to be another hunger dice. Oh wait, that knocked

02:27:35.183 --> 02:27:41.526
that one over! This is one success, one blood
fail.

02:27:41.526 --> 02:27:56.288
TALIESIN: One blood fail. I think you stand there,
staring for a little while at where Laura was,

02:27:56.288 --> 02:28:02.375
wondering if she was going to go. And you stand
there and stare for so long that you don't realize

02:28:02.375 --> 02:28:09.011
that he is actually-- the bouncer is like, "I'm
going to go get you some gauze or something, man.

02:28:09.011 --> 02:28:10.836
"No, I'll be right back."

02:28:10.836 --> 02:28:14.376
TRAVIS: You don't even really-- is it bleeding?

02:28:14.376 --> 02:28:16.337
TALIESIN: "Oh, that's nasty, man."

02:28:16.337 --> 02:28:17.570
TRAVIS: Is the bone out?

02:28:17.570 --> 02:28:23.259
TALIESIN: "Yeah, that's a little nasty." He's
going to walk to the bar and once he goes to the

02:28:23.259 --> 02:28:25.199
bar, you make a dash up.

02:28:25.199 --> 02:28:27.265
LAURA: We can all go up. The bouncer's gone. Let's
go!

02:28:27.265 --> 02:28:29.759
TRAVIS: Is he going to be looking for me? You got
to do what you need to do.

02:28:29.759 --> 02:28:31.200
SAM: What, you're going to stay?

02:28:31.200 --> 02:28:35.105
TRAVIS: Yeah. There's four of us. Three go. Go!

02:28:35.105 --> 02:28:38.514
SAM: Oh god. Does it hurt?

02:28:38.514 --> 02:28:44.019
TRAVIS: Not yet. The vampire shock will wear off
in a second.

02:28:44.019 --> 02:28:46.817
TALIESIN: Fun fact: There is no such thing as
vampire shock.

02:28:46.817 --> 02:28:49.313
TRAVIS: And then all the humans in this bar will
be dead.

02:28:49.313 --> 02:28:54.561
SAM: Do you need me to bite your finger to pour my
regenerative blood on it or anything?

02:28:54.561 --> 02:28:55.927
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:28:55.927 --> 02:28:58.399
SAM: I will bite his finger.

02:28:58.399 --> 02:29:07.393
TALIESIN: Roll a strength plus two, since there's
no real--

02:29:07.393 --> 02:29:11.015
LAURA and SAM: Critical success!

02:29:11.015 --> 02:29:12.874
TALIESIN: Those are two blood criticals.

02:29:12.874 --> 02:29:15.071
SAM: Two blood criticals and a fail.

02:29:15.071 --> 02:29:23.863
TALIESIN: Okay. So this is called a messy
critical, so you bite his finger clean off.

02:29:23.863 --> 02:29:26.673
TRAVIS: (laughs) What the fuck?

02:29:26.673 --> 02:29:27.763
SAM: I'm sorry!

02:29:27.763 --> 02:29:32.122
TRAVIS: (shouting) I just said bite it to fix it!
I'm a ninja turtle now!

02:29:32.122 --> 02:29:34.686
SAM: I can heal it. I bite my wrist.

02:29:34.686 --> 02:29:36.169
TALIESIN: You don't know how this works.

02:29:36.169 --> 02:29:41.004
SAM: I saw True Blood! I bite my wrist and I rub
it on the stuff.

02:29:41.004 --> 02:29:46.460
TALIESIN: Give me a strength plus two roll for
your wrist.

02:29:46.460 --> 02:29:50.664
SAM: One success, one fail.

02:29:50.664 --> 02:29:53.825
TALIESIN: Yeah, you're just gnawing at yourself.
It's not going well.

02:29:53.825 --> 02:29:58.892
SAM: You said plus two! Wait, what does that mean,
plus two? I roll two more dice?

02:29:58.892 --> 02:30:00.268
TALIESIN: Yeah. Plus two more dice.

02:30:00.268 --> 02:30:05.217
SAM: Oh, okay then. One success, one fail and
two more successes. Three successes.

02:30:05.217 --> 02:30:10.919
TALIESIN: You have now managed to damage yourself.
Take a point of damage for gnawing through your wrist.

02:30:10.919 --> 02:30:14.046
TRAVIS: What the hell, man?

02:30:14.046 --> 02:30:19.547
TALIESIN: The bouncer is now coming back over and
he's coming. "What--"

02:30:19.547 --> 02:30:26.648
TRAVIS: This guy-- not this gentleman. This guy that
just bolted for the bathrooms, he just pulled my

02:30:26.753 --> 02:30:27.550
finger--

02:30:27.550 --> 02:30:30.311
TALIESIN: You are literally holding his finger
right now, I'm just pointing that out.

02:30:30.311 --> 02:30:35.864
SAM: Listen man, we had some bad ecstasy and we're
just freaking out a little right now.

02:30:35.864 --> 02:30:41.372
TRAVIS: Do you have a first aid kit? I'll get out
of your hair. I'll just need a first aid kit.

02:30:41.372 --> 02:30:47.132
LAURA: Can I come down the stairs from above and
be like, what are you guys doing down here?

02:30:47.132 --> 02:30:50.088
SAM: We were trying to do the finger trick.

02:30:50.088 --> 02:30:51.630
TRAVIS: We were trying to get on the list.

02:30:51.630 --> 02:30:53.306
LAURA: These guys are with me.

02:30:53.306 --> 02:31:03.222
TALIESIN: Wow. Roll a charisma persuasion. That's
so solid! Man, that's some Comic Con shit right

02:31:03.222 --> 02:31:05.099
there! Fuck.

02:31:05.099 --> 02:31:08.587
TRAVIS: A voice from above says--

02:31:08.587 --> 02:31:11.776
LAURA: Two successes, one blood fail.

02:31:11.776 --> 02:31:16.624
TALIESIN: Two successes, one blood fail? This guy
ain't that bright.

02:31:16.624 --> 02:31:18.066
SAM: There's a lot of fails.

02:31:18.066 --> 02:31:19.993
LAURA: Well yeah, but those don't count. It's only
blood fails that count.

02:31:19.993 --> 02:31:22.013
SAM: Is that true?

02:31:22.013 --> 02:31:32.766
TALIESIN: They're the ones that &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; count.
"This is more than I'm really up for. This is a

02:31:32.766 --> 02:31:38.721
"lot." He's just going to shove. "I can't--"

02:31:38.721 --> 02:31:43.380
SAM: Well, the old bite someone's finger off to
get in the VIP section trick.

02:31:43.380 --> 02:31:48.352
TALIESIN: You have traumatized this poor bouncer.
This was not a good night for him.

02:31:48.352 --> 02:31:52.878
TRAVIS: Is the wound continuing to bleed or does
it--

02:31:52.878 --> 02:31:54.934
SAM: Did my blood heal him at all?

02:31:54.934 --> 02:32:01.069
TALIESIN: Do you want to think about making your
finger not be a problem anymore?

02:32:01.069 --> 02:32:02.119
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:32:02.119 --> 02:32:04.147
TALIESIN: Are you going to try to meditate upon
that?

02:32:04.147 --> 02:32:05.258
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:32:05.258 --> 02:32:08.469
SAM: I'm going to try to put the finger back onto
the stump to see if seals.

02:32:08.469 --> 02:32:11.276
LAURA: Hold it. Maybe it will coagulate or scab
over.

02:32:11.276 --> 02:32:14.540
TALIESIN: Roll a hunger die.

02:32:14.540 --> 02:32:16.328
TRAVIS: Just one?

02:32:16.328 --> 02:32:17.081
TALIESIN: Yeah.

02:32:17.081 --> 02:32:18.699
LIAM: Losing one finger is not &lt;i&gt;the&lt;/i&gt; worst.

02:32:18.699 --> 02:32:21.703
TRAVIS: Four.

02:32:21.703 --> 02:32:24.254
TALIESIN: Let me see. Hold on.

02:32:24.254 --> 02:32:26.324
LAURA: Better than one.

02:32:26.324 --> 02:32:33.288
TALIESIN: I'm trying to find all my stuff-- here
we are. Your finger does not grow back, but it

02:32:33.288 --> 02:32:37.178
stops bleeding and crystallizes.

02:32:37.178 --> 02:32:39.012
TRAVIS: What does my blood look like?

02:32:39.012 --> 02:32:46.250
TALIESIN: It is a deep, dark crystalline red. It's
got a little bit of shimmer to it, not twilight

02:32:46.250 --> 02:32:48.208
sparkle! Motherfuckers.

02:32:48.208 --> 02:32:50.786
TRAVIS: But that's actually the name of a show.

02:32:50.786 --> 02:32:51.990
TALIESIN: Twilight Sparkle?

02:32:51.990 --> 02:32:54.110
SAM: It's a character from My Little Pony.

02:32:54.110 --> 02:32:57.192
LIAM: Secret messages.

02:32:57.192 --> 02:33:04.721
TALIESIN: Secret messages. It's the best. But it
almost seems to glow with a life of its own.

02:33:04.721 --> 02:33:08.694
There's something about it that's a little
brighter. There's something about it that's a

02:33:08.694 --> 02:33:10.001
little more--

02:33:10.001 --> 02:33:13.180
TRAVIS: Brighter than the rest of these murdering
fucks?

02:33:13.180 --> 02:33:18.763
TALIESIN: It's part of your Aura Perception. Your
blood almost seems to have a life of its own.

02:33:18.763 --> 02:33:21.810
There's something about it that's supernatural.

02:33:21.810 --> 02:33:24.400
SAM: I'm going to suck his severed finger like a
popsicle.

02:33:24.400 --> 02:33:27.734
TRAVIS: I am going to &lt;i&gt;resist&lt;/i&gt;! Oh no, it's the
one you took!

02:33:27.734 --> 02:33:30.743
SAM: Do I get anything out of it?

02:33:30.743 --> 02:33:33.372
TALIESIN: Really, really awful fanart, but beyond
that--

02:33:33.372 --> 02:33:35.202
SAM: (slurping)

02:33:35.202 --> 02:33:37.452
(groaning)

02:33:37.452 --> 02:33:39.565
TALIESIN: The best. The best fanart.

02:33:39.565 --> 02:33:40.828
TRAVIS: Always you.

02:33:40.828 --> 02:33:42.575
LAURA: Stop sucking on my husband's finger!

02:33:42.575 --> 02:33:45.208
TALIESIN: This is not the worst thing I've seen in
a vampire game.

02:33:45.208 --> 02:33:50.414
LIAM: I'm sure. I guess I'll show up at the bottom
of the stairs now, too. I wasn't there for that.

02:33:50.414 --> 02:33:54.145
Laura! I feel like you're really unsafe up there
without me.

02:33:54.145 --> 02:33:55.928
LAURA: Did you see us go up?

02:33:55.928 --> 02:33:59.871
LIAM: Yes, I did as I was crossing through.
Absolutely. I saw the altercation.

02:33:59.871 --> 02:34:03.041
LAURA: I come back down. He's the last one, 
I swear.

02:34:03.041 --> 02:34:05.229
TALIESIN: Let me check. (scoffs)

02:34:05.229 --> 02:34:07.228
LAURA: Come on.

02:34:07.228 --> 02:34:10.629
LIAM: Love you! Thanks.

02:34:10.629 --> 02:34:13.905
TALIESIN: Are you going to try and heal your wrist
too, as well?

02:34:13.957 --> 02:34:15.422
SAM: Do I do that?

02:34:15.475 --> 02:34:16.358
TALIESIN: You can try.

02:34:16.358 --> 02:34:17.819
SAM: Do I get any blood out of the finger?

02:34:17.819 --> 02:34:23.591
TALIESIN: It's weird, man. It tastes weird. It's
making you feel weird. It's like Dodger Dog weird.

02:34:23.591 --> 02:34:25.747
That's probably for the best.

02:34:25.747 --> 02:34:27.778
LAURA: In Interview with a Vampire, it's bad to
feed on other vampires.

02:34:27.778 --> 02:34:30.916
SAM: Oh, I didn't know. I haven't seen that! I
haven't seen that, because that's the one with Tom Cruise.

02:34:30.916 --> 02:34:33.652
LAURA: Right? It's bad to feed on other vampires.

02:34:33.652 --> 02:34:35.866
LIAM: I mean, are we supposed to be referencing
films for this?

02:34:35.866 --> 02:34:38.316
TALIESIN: That's pretty much what you have to go
on right now.

02:34:38.316 --> 02:34:39.888
TRAVIS: It's dead blood, yeah.

02:34:39.888 --> 02:34:43.640
SAM: If my wrist hurts, I'll think about it.
Sure.

02:34:43.640 --> 02:34:47.618
LAURA: But in the book series I read, vampires fed
on other vampires and it was totally chill.

02:34:47.618 --> 02:34:49.017
LIAM: Book series?

02:34:49.017 --> 02:34:50.846
TALIESIN: Roll a d10.

02:34:50.846 --> 02:34:52.001
SAM: Two.

02:34:52.001 --> 02:34:58.390
TALIESIN: You gain a hunger, but your wrist
seems to-- you've got them. That's fine.

02:34:58.390 --> 02:35:02.326
Rob me of all my joy. I will remember this.

02:35:02.326 --> 02:35:04.911
SAM: And then what? I heal?

02:35:04.911 --> 02:35:06.767
TALIESIN: You're healed for that.

02:35:06.767 --> 02:35:08.580
SAM: So I get my health point back?

02:35:08.580 --> 02:35:13.058
TRAVIS: So we make our way to the top of the
stairs. What do we see?

02:35:13.058 --> 02:35:18.203
TALIESIN: This is where the &lt;i&gt;real&lt;/i&gt; club is. It's a
completely different DJ, it's a completely

02:35:18.203 --> 02:35:24.226
different crowd. Except of course, that being a
goth industrial club, it could've been the same DJ

02:35:24.226 --> 02:35:28.765
and the exact same crowd and no one would ever
notice. It's still a bunch of people dressed in black.

02:35:28.765 --> 02:35:31.456
LIAM: The music doesn't really change too
much.

02:35:31.515 --> 02:35:33.222
TALIESIN: No, it's just a different track of the
same vibe.

02:35:33.222 --> 02:35:34.576
LIAM: Got it.

02:35:34.576 --> 02:35:37.091
LAURA: Does it feel like Blade? Like, are people
dressed super-cool?

02:35:37.091 --> 02:35:42.055
TALIESIN: Yes, actually. There's a lot of black
leather; there's a lot of black vinyl. People have

02:35:42.055 --> 02:35:46.720
obviously dressed up and done nice makeup. You
can't tell if necessarily everybody is wearing

02:35:46.720 --> 02:35:50.580
the nice makeup, but it's definitely-- these are
some pretty people who have gone out of their way

02:35:50.580 --> 02:35:52.229
to be extra pretty tonight.

02:35:52.229 --> 02:35:53.777
LIAM: Who's on the fringes that stands out?

02:35:53.777 --> 02:36:00.408
TALIESIN: This is a &lt;i&gt;large&lt;/i&gt; dance floor with a
main stage for the DJ.

02:36:00.408 --> 02:36:06.026
SAM: Taliesin, the music. Are we talking things
that I would recognize? Chemical Brothers, your

02:36:06.026 --> 02:36:07.609
Fat Boy Slims?

02:36:07.609 --> 02:36:09.739
TRAVIS: Fat Boy Slim.

02:36:09.739 --> 02:36:17.052
TALIESIN: You're such a gift. Ugh. Nothing. No.

02:36:17.052 --> 02:36:23.241
LAURA: Are there any tables in the corner?
Anywhere where it looks like important people

02:36:23.241 --> 02:36:24.454
would be sitting?

02:36:24.454 --> 02:36:31.371
TALIESIN: There are some little corner tables all
around the outskirts. There's obviously a couple

02:36:31.371 --> 02:36:35.776
dance boxes. But there are corner tables all around
the outskirts, but they all seem roped off and

02:36:35.776 --> 02:36:40.180
there are definitely people sitting there who seem
like they have these tables on reserve.

02:36:40.180 --> 02:36:42.825
TRAVIS: Are there any golden thrones?

02:36:42.825 --> 02:36:47.936
TALIESIN: No golden thrones. Just wumpa wumpa
music, a couple go-go boxes, a--

02:36:47.936 --> 02:36:49.106
TRAVIS: A bar?

02:36:49.106 --> 02:36:53.587
TALIESIN: There is a bar. There is a very nice
bar. Three sides, two bartenders.

02:36:53.587 --> 02:37:01.868
SAM: I want to go on the dance floor and see if I
can chat anybody up. Excuse me.

02:37:01.868 --> 02:37:05.209
TALIESIN: Are you really just doing the
Chattanooga Choo Choo? I really hope you are.

02:37:05.209 --> 02:37:08.541
SAM: With a white man's overbite.

02:37:08.541 --> 02:37:14.744
TALIESIN: All right. Are you going to try and chat
up a guy or a girl?

02:37:14.744 --> 02:37:22.885
SAM: A female. Using my vampiric charms, I'm going
to say: Hey! Where is he tonight?

02:37:22.885 --> 02:37:26.681
TALIESIN: Where... is he?

02:37:26.681 --> 02:37:28.776
SAM: Where is &lt;i&gt;he&lt;/i&gt; tonight?

02:37:28.776 --> 02:37:31.559
TALIESIN: Where is he tonight?

02:37:31.559 --> 02:37:33.459
SAM: Yeah, the big man. You know.

02:37:33.459 --> 02:37:43.112
TALIESIN: The girl who has her back towards you,
who was ignoring you, turns around, and Satine

02:37:43.112 --> 02:37:47.645
looks you in the face and says, "What the fuck are
you talking about?"

02:37:47.645 --> 02:37:49.141
SAM: Oh hey!

02:37:49.141 --> 02:37:50.152
TALIESIN: "Hey Sam!"

02:37:50.152 --> 02:38:00.157
SAM: Hey! You know, the guy who runs the show. The
guy who runs the club, the most important of us here.

02:38:00.157 --> 02:38:03.512
TALIESIN: "Did you-- is &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; what's been going
on?"

02:38:03.512 --> 02:38:04.890
SAM: Yeah.

02:38:04.890 --> 02:38:06.114
TALIESIN: "So you're all--"

02:38:06.114 --> 02:38:08.849
SAM: Yeah, that's how it is.

02:38:08.849 --> 02:38:10.596
TALIESIN: "All right. That's cool."

02:38:10.596 --> 02:38:11.643
SAM: Is it?

02:38:11.643 --> 02:38:12.811
TALIESIN: "Yeah."

02:38:12.811 --> 02:38:14.303
SAM: Have you always been like this?

02:38:14.303 --> 02:38:17.595
TALIESIN: "Yeah. Why?"

02:38:17.595 --> 02:38:18.860
SAM: &lt;i&gt;Always&lt;/i&gt; always?

02:38:18.860 --> 02:38:26.682
TALIESIN: "There are no-- we come in and shoot at
night, man. Have you not been paying attention

02:38:26.682 --> 02:38:27.654
"this whole time?"

02:38:27.654 --> 02:38:29.164
SAM: I don't know most of the crew.

02:38:29.164 --> 02:38:31.128
TALIESIN: "You are really oblivious. It's like--"

02:38:31.128 --> 02:38:33.178
LIAM: Hey. We're a little--

02:38:33.178 --> 02:38:34.112
TALIESIN: "Hey."

02:38:34.112 --> 02:38:35.108
LIAM: And hey, yeah.

02:38:35.108 --> 02:38:37.167
TALIESIN: "Yeah, no, you're-- wow, you got the
whole thing going on."

02:38:37.167 --> 02:38:39.098
LIAM: Yeah. We're unlikely, I know.

02:38:39.098 --> 02:38:41.625
TALIESIN: "Wow. This has been a rough week,
then. Okay!"

02:38:41.625 --> 02:38:43.270
LIAM: It's pretty good though.

02:38:43.270 --> 02:38:44.999
TALIESIN: "No, you look like you're doing okay."

02:38:44.999 --> 02:38:46.029
LIAM: Then join me.

02:38:46.029 --> 02:38:47.332
TALIESIN and LAURA: Hey!

02:38:47.332 --> 02:38:49.761
TALIESIN: "What happened?"

02:38:49.761 --> 02:38:52.727
LIAM: Yeah, that happened.

02:38:52.727 --> 02:38:54.137
TRAVIS: My dark gift.

02:38:54.137 --> 02:39:00.994
TALIESIN: "This is a once-a-week thing, it's very
exclusive. I'm amazed, even with this that you

02:39:00.994 --> 02:39:03.916
"guys got-- This is a very serious thing, like this
is-- this place."

02:39:03.916 --> 02:39:08.102
LAURA: Satine, can you help us?

02:39:08.165 --> 02:39:11.338
TALIESIN: "Yeah. What do you need? You want a
drink? You need anything?"

02:39:11.338 --> 02:39:15.476
LAURA: Well, do you know what happened there? Do
you know what happened up at the studio?

02:39:15.476 --> 02:39:22.189
TALIESIN: "I mean, TwitchCon was this week. I've
been really busy. I've got a whole--"

02:39:22.189 --> 02:39:29.574
LAURA: It's fucking crazy. It went crazy. Like,
the server room is a giant meatball.

02:39:29.574 --> 02:39:31.558
Everybody's--

02:39:31.558 --> 02:39:33.184
SAM: Matt and Marisha are dead.

02:39:33.184 --> 02:39:34.899
TALIESIN: "Like dead?"

02:39:34.899 --> 02:39:37.203
TRAVIS: No. Like ashes and mushrooms.

02:39:37.203 --> 02:39:41.620
LAURA: Like, nobody told us what was going on. We
just woke up in coffins.

02:39:41.620 --> 02:39:45.108
TALIESIN: "Holy shit. Okay. Hold on--"

02:39:45.108 --> 02:39:46.704
LIAM: Is that how it normally goes down?

02:39:46.704 --> 02:39:51.697
TALIESIN: "Nah, this is weird. Normally, there's a
lot of talk about-- Okay, I'm going to talk to a

02:39:51.697 --> 02:39:54.819
"few people. You guys-- hmm."

02:39:54.819 --> 02:39:58.443
TRAVIS: Before you go, have you seen Taliesin?
He's the only one we haven't seen.

02:39:58.443 --> 02:40:02.882
TALIESIN: "Oh god. You know, I've been asking him
to come out to this club for ages and he just

02:40:02.882 --> 02:40:03.884
"never comes out."

02:40:03.884 --> 02:40:05.611
LAURA: Is he like us?

02:40:05.611 --> 02:40:14.734
TALIESIN: "I mean, not that I'm aware of... He's
his own thing. That's just a whole thing, but

02:40:14.734 --> 02:40:16.311
"you know."

02:40:16.311 --> 02:40:18.318
SAM: Is he here tonight? Have you seen him?

02:40:18.318 --> 02:40:20.413
TALIESIN: "As far as I know, he's never been
here."

02:40:20.413 --> 02:40:22.889
SAM: Who runs this club? Whose club is this?

02:40:22.889 --> 02:40:28.509
TALIESIN: "Oh, that's a complicated story we'll
get into. That's complicated, but it's good that

02:40:28.509 --> 02:40:34.680
"you're here. We're going to work this out. Why
don't you guys just don't ruffle any feathers? Go

02:40:34.680 --> 02:40:35.900
"have a drink."

02:40:35.900 --> 02:40:38.487
TRAVIS: Any recommendations from the bar?

02:40:38.487 --> 02:40:40.160
TALIESIN: "Have a cocktail."

02:40:40.160 --> 02:40:41.469
LIAM: Special menu?

02:40:41.469 --> 02:40:44.381
TALIESIN: "The whole menu's special. It'll
be good."

02:40:44.381 --> 02:40:45.933
TRAVIS: Fair enough. I head towards the bar.

02:40:45.933 --> 02:40:48.095
LAURA: We were buried with no money. Does that
matter?

02:40:48.095 --> 02:40:49.438
TALIESIN: "No. You're fine."

02:40:49.438 --> 02:40:50.888
LAURA: Is this like a mushroom--

02:40:50.888 --> 02:40:52.212
TALIESIN: "You got a Twitch show! You're great!"

02:40:52.212 --> 02:40:58.428
SAM: Do you think they have any Ace of Base
records that we could request?

02:40:58.428 --> 02:41:00.223
TRAVIS: I saw the sign...

02:41:00.223 --> 02:41:04.649
TRAVIS and LAURA: (singing)

02:41:04.649 --> 02:41:09.638
TALIESIN: (laughs) "Thankfully, this is a club that
caters to people whose tastes haven't changed in

02:41:09.638 --> 02:41:18.975
"decades, so you're going to be-- You're going to
fit in, but no. No Ace of Base. I'll be right back."

02:41:18.975 --> 02:41:20.209
TRAVIS: We go to the bar.

02:41:20.209 --> 02:41:23.343
LAURA: Maybe we can get rid of some of this hunger.
Help us.

02:41:23.343 --> 02:41:33.727
TRAVIS: Okay. Barkeep! Would you thrill us with
four glasses of whatever you would like tonight?

02:41:33.727 --> 02:41:35.534
LAURA: Something red.

02:41:35.534 --> 02:41:36.990
TRAVIS: Dealer's choice.

02:41:36.990 --> 02:41:41.325
SAM: Blood. We would like to drink human blood. We
need human blood to drink.

02:41:41.325 --> 02:41:43.131
TALIESIN: "I got just the thing. Hold on."

02:41:43.131 --> 02:41:44.348
LIAM: Oh man, that's so gauche.

02:41:44.348 --> 02:41:49.747
TALIESIN: He goes and there is literally a tap
that gets pulled and a red foamy lager.

02:41:49.747 --> 02:41:53.615
TRAVIS: Does somebody scream when it gets pulled?
(yelling)

02:41:53.675 --> 02:42:07.881
TALIESIN: Pulls four weird foamy beers that
are definitely-- St. Valentine's Day Specials, is what

02:42:07.881 --> 02:42:08.692
I'll say.

02:42:08.692 --> 02:42:11.625
TRAVIS: Do they smell Irish? European?

02:42:11.625 --> 02:42:15.059
TALIESIN: They smell, if I had to place it--

02:42:15.059 --> 02:42:17.190
TRAVIS: Has a nose of--?

02:42:17.190 --> 02:42:24.375
TALIESIN: It's the best, it's tomato juice and
vodka and just a little something special, a

02:42:24.375 --> 02:42:26.414
little bit of Worcestershire. It's got a little
bit of that.

02:42:26.414 --> 02:42:27.721
LAURA: Drink it up!

02:42:27.721 --> 02:42:32.672
TRAVIS: A toast. I feel we're finally in a sort of
safe place.

02:42:32.672 --> 02:42:35.092
LIAM: Yeah, we're civilized.

02:42:35.092 --> 02:42:37.371
TRAVIS: To the new world order, right?

02:42:37.371 --> 02:42:38.373
LIAM: Yes.

02:42:38.373 --> 02:42:39.980
TRAVIS: To our fallen--

02:42:39.980 --> 02:42:41.074
LAURA: Homies.

02:42:41.074 --> 02:42:46.434
TRAVIS: Yeah. May they live forever as dust
and spore.

02:42:46.434 --> 02:42:50.958
SAM: And to the confidence that we all have, having
killed a human being.

02:42:50.958 --> 02:42:53.467
LIAM: Fucking A.

02:42:53.467 --> 02:42:56.449
SAM: True vampires.

02:42:56.449 --> 02:42:59.933
LAURA: True vampires! Just kidding, baby.

02:42:59.933 --> 02:43:03.326
TRAVIS: Drink up! To rats.

02:43:03.326 --> 02:43:05.930
SAM: First kill, man. It just felt so good.

02:43:05.930 --> 02:43:09.664
LAURA: If it had been somebody we didn't know.
It's just because it was Mike!

02:43:09.664 --> 02:43:14.061
TRAVIS: You're sleeping in your own coffin
tonight.

02:43:14.061 --> 02:43:16.649
SAM: You don't have a double wide.

02:43:16.649 --> 02:43:19.596
TRAVIS and LAURA: California king!

02:43:19.596 --> 02:43:26.011
TALIESIN: Wow. I'd never even thought about that and
now it's going to be the only thing I think about

02:43:26.011 --> 02:43:30.600
for the rest of the night. What's a California
King coffin look like?

02:43:30.600 --> 02:43:31.811
LAURA: Comfy.

02:43:31.811 --> 02:43:34.108
TALIESIN: Very comfortable. They're not comfy.

02:43:34.108 --> 02:43:37.643
LIAM: What would the Briarwoods do? Like a side
car?

02:43:37.643 --> 02:43:44.419
TRAVIS: As we sip these drinks and we turn our backs 
to the bar, posting up like one does,

02:43:44.419 --> 02:43:51.559
can I see with my Heightened Senses anyone 
giving us a look of malcontent?

02:43:51.559 --> 02:44:02.623
TALIESIN: A look of malcontent? There's a mix of
faces in the crowd. There's definitely some

02:44:02.623 --> 02:44:10.118
indifference, there's some people who are eyeing
you very suspiciously, and a few smiling faces who

02:44:10.118 --> 02:44:11.811
seem delighted.

02:44:11.811 --> 02:44:16.653
TRAVIS: Before I look at the smiling faces, do I
get any whiff of a giant dog in the crowd?

02:44:16.653 --> 02:44:20.083
TALIESIN: That would require a blood roll.

02:44:20.083 --> 02:44:21.595
TRAVIS: I'll do that.

02:44:21.595 --> 02:44:25.260
LAURA: Do we get rid of one of our blood dice from
this lager?

02:44:25.260 --> 02:44:28.084
TRAVIS: Perception and investigation. Jesus--

02:44:28.084 --> 02:44:30.788
TALIESIN: Yeah, I love the toss.

02:44:30.788 --> 02:44:33.527
TRAVIS: I'll use the Heightened Senses aspect.

02:44:33.527 --> 02:44:40.053
TALIESIN: You also lose a blood die because of--
if you have one, you have to be at one at all times.

02:44:40.053 --> 02:44:42.908
TRAVIS: Two successes.

02:44:42.908 --> 02:44:49.991
TALIESIN: Two successes? Yeah, something smells a
little doggish. There's a little wolf, but it's

02:44:49.991 --> 02:44:52.946
not what you had last time. It's something else.

02:44:52.946 --> 02:44:57.783
TRAVIS: Can I focus on the smiling faces and see
what we see?

02:44:57.783 --> 02:45:03.148
TALIESIN: Yeah, there's definitely a bouncing,
bobbing Erika Ishii who's jumping around the

02:45:03.148 --> 02:45:05.940
crowd, having a good time and she just seems happy
that's--

02:45:05.940 --> 02:45:09.407
TRAVIS: Laura? Erika Ishii's here.

02:45:09.407 --> 02:45:11.742
LAURA: (squealing) I run over and start dancing
with Erika.

02:45:11.742 --> 02:45:13.811
TALIESIN: As she sees you, (squealing).

02:45:13.811 --> 02:45:16.694
LAURA: Are you a vampire?

02:45:16.694 --> 02:45:17.869
TALIESIN: "What? I mean, yeah!"

02:45:17.869 --> 02:45:18.783
LAURA: Oh my god!

02:45:18.783 --> 02:45:19.606
TALIESIN: "Oh my god!"

02:45:19.606 --> 02:45:20.535
LAURA: How long have you been a vampire?

02:45:20.535 --> 02:45:21.352
TALIESIN: "Oh, ages!"

02:45:21.352 --> 02:45:22.410
LAURA: Really?

02:45:22.410 --> 02:45:23.191
TALIESIN: "Yeah!"

02:45:23.191 --> 02:45:24.698
LAURA: Oh, that would make so much sense.

02:45:24.698 --> 02:45:26.328
TALIESIN: "Doesn't it? Sunscreen. It's a trick."

02:45:26.328 --> 02:45:27.609
TRAVIS: Her hair's so cool.

02:45:27.609 --> 02:45:31.477
TALIESIN: No, it's why she has such great hair.
It's the undead. Hair of the undead. It's the

02:45:31.477 --> 02:45:32.809
haircut that did it.

02:45:32.809 --> 02:45:34.380
LIAM: Is all the energy vampiric?

02:45:34.380 --> 02:45:40.417
TALIESIN: All the energy seems to be-- oh yeah.
From her? I mean, that makes sense, doesn't it?

02:45:40.417 --> 02:45:43.411
LIAM: Does it? Because I want some of that.

02:45:43.411 --> 02:45:47.984
TALIESIN: That's a different vibe than you've got,
sadly. You've got a different vibe going on.

02:45:47.984 --> 02:45:49.229
LIAM: Okay.

02:45:49.229 --> 02:45:52.462
LAURA: Erika?

02:45:52.462 --> 02:45:54.073
TALIESIN: "Yeah. Yeah! Hey!"

02:45:54.073 --> 02:45:56.959
LAURA: Where are the people that run this place?

02:45:56.959 --> 02:45:58.174
TALIESIN: "What?"

02:45:58.174 --> 02:45:59.576
LAURA: Where are the people that run this place?

02:45:59.576 --> 02:46:00.798
TALIESIN: "Well, I mean, they're here!"

02:46:00.798 --> 02:46:03.888
LAURA: How do we find them? How do we know what's
going on?

02:46:03.888 --> 02:46:07.525
TALIESIN: "I don't know! What's going on is just a
party! It's great! Yeah!"

02:46:07.525 --> 02:46:09.220
LAURA: It's great.

02:46:09.220 --> 02:46:10.230
TALIESIN: "It's so great!"

02:46:10.230 --> 02:46:11.321
LAURA: This is a lot for me.

02:46:11.321 --> 02:46:21.504
TALIESIN: (shouting) "I'll be right back!" She
bounces out. There's a few minutes of sitting,

02:46:21.504 --> 02:46:26.640
watching this crowd. There's definitely, slowly
starting to become more concerned faces checking

02:46:26.640 --> 02:46:28.335
you out.

02:46:28.335 --> 02:46:29.939
SAM: Checking &lt;i&gt;us&lt;/i&gt; out?

02:46:29.939 --> 02:46:31.082
TALIESIN: Yeah.

02:46:31.082 --> 02:46:32.258
TRAVIS: None that we recognize, though?

02:46:32.258 --> 02:46:39.741
TALIESIN: Well, give me a perception awareness,
just for fun. Just see if you maybe know any of

02:46:39.741 --> 02:46:40.954
these people.

02:46:40.954 --> 02:46:45.693
LIAM: I'm still riding high on Friedle. I start
dancing.

02:46:45.693 --> 02:46:47.489
TRAVIS: A critical. Two tens.

02:46:47.489 --> 02:46:57.676
TALIESIN: Critical success? Yeah, there's a few
people that you're starting to recognize, but not

02:46:57.676 --> 02:46:59.872
people you know personally, but there's
definitely--

02:46:59.872 --> 02:47:01.213
LAURA: Celebrities?

02:47:01.213 --> 02:47:07.510
TALIESIN: There's a few people who have a TV deal
in here. There's a couple serious TV deals in

02:47:07.510 --> 02:47:14.241
here. There's definitely a couple familiar faces
rounding around. Nobody that you're close to, but

02:47:14.241 --> 02:47:15.800
there's a--

02:47:15.800 --> 02:47:17.596
TRAVIS: This is a happening spot.

02:47:17.596 --> 02:47:23.312
TALIESIN: Few ironic faces. Juliet Landau wanders
through for a second and just nods and walks by.

02:47:23.312 --> 02:47:34.805
They're nodding and obviously talking about
something and after a while, somebody comes up and

02:47:34.805 --> 02:47:39.642
talks to Erika for a second in the corner and she
comes bounding over. "They want to talk to you guys."

02:47:39.642 --> 02:47:43.107
LAURA: Okay. Should we be nervous?

02:47:43.107 --> 02:47:49.019
TALIESIN: "No. I'm sure it's fine. You just got to
be cool. You guys are cool."

02:47:49.019 --> 02:47:50.598
SAM: We're so cool.

02:47:50.598 --> 02:47:53.093
TRAVIS: Yeah, look at Sam. We're totally cool.

02:47:53.093 --> 02:48:06.310
TALIESIN: "You guys are cool, yeah. It's fine."
And you're taken to a far corner table, the

02:48:06.310 --> 02:48:12.833
furthest, deepest corner so that you have the
best-- it's the furthest away from the speakers.

02:48:12.833 --> 02:48:21.914
It's really nice. You can actually talk like
humans. And there, very gently spinning a very

02:48:21.914 --> 02:48:27.863
nice cocktail, is a mildly irritated-looking Yuri
Lowenthal.

02:48:27.863 --> 02:48:32.585
LAURA: Oh my god, this makes so much sense!

02:48:32.585 --> 02:48:34.458
TALIESIN: It makes so much sense, doesn't it?

02:48:34.458 --> 02:48:36.517
TRAVIS: He speaks nine languages.

02:48:36.517 --> 02:48:38.606
LAURA: Like, he's a ninja, for real.

02:48:38.693 --> 02:48:43.693
TALIESIN: Why they never age. The two of them just
don't age, do they? He's just peppering with fake

02:48:43.693 --> 02:48:47.162
color in the hair, that's all it is.

02:48:47.294 --> 02:48:48.321
SAM: It's Yuri!

02:48:48.321 --> 02:48:49.867
LAURA: What's up, man?

02:48:49.867 --> 02:48:59.611
TALIESIN: "Hey. I mean, this is weird, guys. So
what happened? Like honestly, we don't know. No one--"

02:48:59.611 --> 02:49:06.531
SAM: Long story short, Geek &amp; Sundry, Legendary,
there's armageddon over there. Monsters roving--

02:49:06.531 --> 02:49:08.713
TALIESIN: "Well, there was a fire, it's all--"

02:49:08.713 --> 02:49:10.097
TRAVIS: It was an explosion.

02:49:10.097 --> 02:49:11.220
SAM: We set it off.

02:49:11.220 --> 02:49:14.350
LAURA: We didn't &lt;i&gt;set it off&lt;/i&gt;, it went off around
us.

02:49:14.350 --> 02:49:17.578
TRAVIS: You remember Matthew Colville, right?

02:49:17.578 --> 02:49:18.826
TALIESIN: "Oh, of course."

02:49:18.826 --> 02:49:25.041
TRAVIS: Yeah, we woke up in coffins, missing
Taliesin. Matt and Marisha were killed while we

02:49:25.041 --> 02:49:27.373
were trying to figure out what was actually going
on.

02:49:27.373 --> 02:49:31.364
TALIESIN: "Well, we'll get to Taliesin. So
Colville did this? Was this his doing?"

02:49:31.364 --> 02:49:34.302
LAURA: No, I don't think it was Matt that did it.
I think--

02:49:34.302 --> 02:49:36.181
LIAM: It all sums back to Gary Gygax.

02:49:36.181 --> 02:49:39.454
TALIESIN: "Wait. Gygax did this?"

02:49:39.454 --> 02:49:40.982
LAURA, TRAVIS and LIAM: Yeah.

02:49:40.982 --> 02:49:46.561
SAM: We don't know if he did it, but he was
involved and there's been a changing of the guard

02:49:46.561 --> 02:49:50.266
or disturbance in the order of things. The lizard
people are very upset.

02:49:50.266 --> 02:49:53.807
LAURA: Yeah. They said that people go down in
their tunnels. They're super pissed.

02:49:53.807 --> 02:49:57.809
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, I was supposed to give you-- I
didn't think it would be you, but I'm supposed to

02:49:57.809 --> 02:50:03.886
say they're very displeased and that we need to
make amends. We've got to find a way back to our

02:50:03.886 --> 02:50:06.048
friendship. You guys are supposed to offer a boon--

02:50:06.048 --> 02:50:08.016
SAM: Who said that? That was--

02:50:08.016 --> 02:50:11.476
TRAVIS: Mahlo, or it was Lockey?

02:50:11.476 --> 02:50:13.598
LAURA: No, it was the head of the lizard guys.

02:50:13.598 --> 02:50:18.795
TALIESIN: "So this is all Gygax? Or was this
Colville and Gygax working together?"

02:50:18.795 --> 02:50:25.890
LAURA: So Gygax said he wanted to play with Matt
Mercer, but then Mercer got killed by the sun and so--

02:50:25.890 --> 02:50:27.619
TALIESIN: "Why does that guy got to be so weird,
man?"

02:50:27.619 --> 02:50:29.294
TRAVIS: I didn't even know he was alive.

02:50:29.294 --> 02:50:33.370
LIAM: Yuri, I'm so sorry. I've got questions.

02:50:33.370 --> 02:50:34.356
TALIESIN: "Sure."

02:50:34.356 --> 02:50:40.507
LIAM: When I met you in '99, 2000, were you
&lt;i&gt;already&lt;/i&gt;? In Princeton, New Jersey?

02:50:40.507 --> 02:50:41.684
TALIESIN: "Oh, no."

02:50:41.684 --> 02:50:43.382
LIAM: So this is somewhere between--

02:50:43.382 --> 02:50:48.837
TALIESIN: "Oh yeah, this wasn't part of the plan
for a while. I've been working towards this, so yeah,

02:50:48.837 --> 02:50:50.398
"this has been a goal for a while."

02:50:50.398 --> 02:50:51.567
TRAVIS: And Tara, too?

02:50:51.567 --> 02:50:52.795
TALIESIN: "Oh yeah, of course."

02:50:52.795 --> 02:50:58.600
LIAM: And what about-- offspring is like Alucard?
Like halfsies?

02:50:58.600 --> 02:51:02.248
TALIESIN: "Oh no, we're raising him just
perfectly. We're trying to do it right, raising

02:51:02.248 --> 02:51:06.160
"him normally, letting him find himself. It's going
to be a while before we--"

02:51:06.160 --> 02:51:08.876
LAURA: So how long does it take to actually
turn?

02:51:08.876 --> 02:51:12.888
TALIESIN: "Oh, it takes about a week and there's a
whole ritual that's involved and usually a

02:51:12.888 --> 02:51:17.810
"becoming, usually somebody-- well, you're supposed
to have somebody--"

02:51:17.810 --> 02:51:19.558
LAURA: Nobody walked us through it!

02:51:19.558 --> 02:51:21.368
TALIESIN: "Yeah. This is a problem. There is--"

02:51:21.368 --> 02:51:23.865
TRAVIS: Rats, man. We ate rats.

02:51:23.865 --> 02:51:26.962
LAURA: Is that bad? I didn't mind.

02:51:26.962 --> 02:51:28.526
LIAM: Some of us ate rats.

02:51:28.526 --> 02:51:35.149
TALIESIN: "Normally there's a process for this and
this is a problem. You're supposed to have a

02:51:35.149 --> 02:51:37.827
"sponsor. Let's put it this way."

02:51:37.827 --> 02:51:39.094
SAM: Like Tor Books?

02:51:39.094 --> 02:51:45.948
TALIESIN: "Like Tor Books." Tor Books. "You're
supposed to have a sponsor and really, this is

02:51:45.948 --> 02:51:53.132
"tricky because there's a process to just make sure
you don't go around killing people and making a

02:51:53.132 --> 02:52:00.365
"scene in these things and there's really-- and you
guys haven't done anything inappropriate yet, have you?"

02:52:00.365 --> 02:52:03.232
TRAVIS: Raise your hand if you haven't done anything
inappropriate.

02:52:03.246 --> 02:52:04.790
SAM: Well, I didn't kill any innocent people.

02:52:04.790 --> 02:52:10.480
LAURA: I mean, the only person that I killed
got burned up in the fire when everything-- so it

02:52:10.480 --> 02:52:13.392
wasn't like we left any evidence, you know?

02:52:13.392 --> 02:52:14.390
TALIESIN: "Yeah. Wow."

02:52:14.390 --> 02:52:16.411
SAM: No bodies around in public places.

02:52:16.411 --> 02:52:17.490
LAURA: Yeah. Nowhere in public.

02:52:17.490 --> 02:52:18.610
LIAM: I'm clean as a whistle.

02:52:18.610 --> 02:52:21.270
TRAVIS: And as far as monsters go, thank god we
know you, right? Seems like you're pretty high up

02:52:21.270 --> 02:52:22.335
right now.

02:52:22.335 --> 02:52:27.847
TALIESIN: "Yeah, I mean, I'm not that high up,
though. I'm really here because they thought that

02:52:27.847 --> 02:52:35.761
"you should have a familiar face. And there's a
bunch of us here who're in it for you guys, but

02:52:35.761 --> 02:52:41.398
"there's a lot of conversation about what to do
with the four of you. We don't even know what

02:52:41.398 --> 02:52:44.071
"family you belong to. This is all so
complicated."

02:52:44.071 --> 02:52:46.032
SAM: Are families assigned to us?

02:52:46.032 --> 02:52:47.854
TALIESIN: "You see, this is the problem."

02:52:47.854 --> 02:52:50.680
TRAVIS: Like a foster situation or--

02:52:50.680 --> 02:52:53.270
TALIESIN: (sighs) "This is where things get so
complicated."

02:52:53.270 --> 02:52:56.537
LIAM: We are ready to learn. Spill it, girl. Spill
it.

02:52:56.620 --> 02:53:08.208
TALIESIN: "Well, (sighs). We've been giving this a
lot of thought, and--"

02:53:08.208 --> 02:53:12.585
LAURA: Are you adopting us?

02:53:12.585 --> 02:53:16.566
TALIESIN: "I wish I could. I'm not-- I just don't
really have that kind of--"

02:53:16.566 --> 02:53:18.053
SAM: Are you going to kill us?

02:53:18.053 --> 02:53:25.067
TALIESIN: "No, I'm not going to do that. But that
has come up as an option."

02:53:25.067 --> 02:53:26.389
LAURA: Oh no!

02:53:26.389 --> 02:53:28.808
TRAVIS: Sure would love to avoid that.

02:53:28.808 --> 02:53:31.344
SAM: We could prove ourselves in a
crucible-style--

02:53:31.344 --> 02:53:35.250
LAURA: Yeah, we can get sorted! Give us a family!

02:53:35.250 --> 02:53:39.083
LIAM: We're getting ahead of ourselves. Yuri,
what's the deal?

02:53:39.083 --> 02:53:44.888
TALIESIN: "Well, you're going to need some kind of
sponsor or we're going to have to deal with you."

02:53:44.888 --> 02:53:46.479
LAURA: How do we get a sponsor?

02:53:46.479 --> 02:53:48.039
LIAM: Yeah, what do we do?

02:53:48.039 --> 02:53:54.286
TALIESIN: "I don't know. I guess I'll see if there's
anybody around who's up to dealing with this and

02:53:54.286 --> 02:54:00.973
"we're going to have to get-- I'm going to have to
get just a little bit of blood from all four of

02:54:00.973 --> 02:54:05.211
"you, because we have to figure out who you are and
where you belong, so--"

02:54:05.211 --> 02:54:06.639
LAURA and TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:54:06.639 --> 02:54:11.240
TALIESIN: He pulls out a little pinprick and a
couple cups, a couple little wine glasses.

02:54:11.240 --> 02:54:16.036
TRAVIS: I stab my newly healing finger.

02:54:16.036 --> 02:54:17.472
SAM: Re-slice open my wrist.

02:54:17.472 --> 02:54:22.846
LAURA: I'm going to look for my big-- this vein
and I'm going to stick it in there.

02:54:22.846 --> 02:54:24.801
TALIESIN: It doesn't really do what you were
hoping it was going to do, but you get some stuff

02:54:24.801 --> 02:54:27.907
out of there. It is as if the circulation is not
really moving the way it's supposed to. You can

02:54:27.907 --> 02:54:29.086
juice it.

02:54:29.086 --> 02:54:32.696
SAM: Ugh. It personally makes me physically
uncomfortable.

02:54:32.696 --> 02:54:35.327
TALIESIN: Yeah. It makes me so happy. It's all I'm
really going for.

02:54:35.327 --> 02:54:40.052
LIAM: All my veins are noticeably large so I don't
think I have a problem.

02:54:40.052 --> 02:54:45.803
TALIESIN: Yeah, you're a little crusty all over
too, but you get in there. Your skin got a little

02:54:45.803 --> 02:54:46.791
crusty.

02:54:46.791 --> 02:54:48.881
TRAVIS: Do you know what's wrong with Liam's
face?

02:54:48.881 --> 02:54:50.548
TALIESIN: "Nothing's wrong with Liam's face. It's
totally normal."

02:54:50.548 --> 02:54:52.179
LIAM: Nothing's wrong with Liam's face.

02:54:52.179 --> 02:54:54.087
TRAVIS: I don't know how to break it to you, man.
You're a little flakey.

02:54:54.087 --> 02:54:55.608
LAURA: &lt;i&gt;Almost&lt;/i&gt; a lizard person.

02:54:55.608 --> 02:54:57.816
TALIESIN: "Yeah, that's a tricky one. We're going
to have to deal with that."

02:54:57.816 --> 02:54:59.555
LIAM: I've been like that for years, man!

02:54:59.555 --> 02:55:00.383
TALIESIN: "Really?"

02:55:00.383 --> 02:55:01.262
LIAM: Yeah.

02:55:01.262 --> 02:55:06.026
LAURA: How much blood do you need? I filled the
cup up, like, halfway.

02:55:06.026 --> 02:55:13.049
TALIESIN: "Yeah, that will do it." So everybody
gets a die. You got a hunger die. You got a hunger

02:55:13.049 --> 02:55:16.681
die. You got a hunger die. You got a hunger die.

02:55:16.681 --> 02:55:19.497
LIAM: Billy Mays here for vampirism!

02:55:19.497 --> 02:55:30.176
TALIESIN: So they go take those in back. Yuri
gets up on stage, stops the DJ. "Ladies and

02:55:30.176 --> 02:55:39.488
"gentlemen, we have a bit of a conundrum. Gary went
and did something dumb this week and I think we

02:55:39.488 --> 02:55:44.756
"all saw it coming. He's been acting weird with the
end of Critical Role. He was getting a little

02:55:44.756 --> 02:55:51.297
"depressed; he's been feeling bad for a while and
he may have taken matters into his own hands and

02:55:51.297 --> 02:55:59.089
"it feels like it's caused a bit of a disruption.
We figured out some of it and thankfully, now

02:55:59.089 --> 02:56:08.541
"we've contained most of the problem. But we have
these four right here. We're getting some results

02:56:08.541 --> 02:56:12.014
"very soon, but is there anybody in the audience--
is there anybody here tonight who would like to

02:56:12.014 --> 02:56:13.802
"sponsor one of these four?"

02:56:13.802 --> 02:56:22.328
SAM: I'm going to take a step forward and say, as
a vampire, as a young, junior vampire, I feel like

02:56:22.328 --> 02:56:35.173
I have a lot to offer. I have strength, maybe not
of body, but of spirit, clearly not mind. And I

02:56:35.173 --> 02:56:45.734
feel like I can make any family proud with my nice-guy
attitude and optimism, which are traits that

02:56:45.734 --> 02:56:52.410
vampires really need. (laughs) Thank you. I yield
the rest of my time.

02:56:52.410 --> 02:56:57.506
TRAVIS: Wow. We all have to do that?

02:56:57.506 --> 02:57:08.945
TALIESIN: Well, I'll tell you what. Really
quickly, give me your wits brawl.

02:57:08.945 --> 02:57:10.051
LAURA: Brawl?

02:57:10.051 --> 02:57:11.844
TALIESIN: Wits plus brawl.

02:57:11.844 --> 02:57:13.595
SAM: I don't understand this game.

02:57:13.595 --> 02:57:17.554
TALIESIN: No, you don't have to roll it. Just tell
me what's your number.

02:57:17.554 --> 02:57:18.500
SAM: Six.

02:57:18.500 --> 02:57:23.466
TALIESIN: Your wits plus brawl is six total? All
right.

02:57:23.466 --> 02:57:28.060
LAURA: Why fight when you got up and gave a
speech? Is somebody about to fight you?

02:57:28.060 --> 02:57:29.574
TRAVIS: This fight is mine.

02:57:29.574 --> 02:57:45.256
TALIESIN: All right. And give me... roll
perception and awareness?

02:57:45.256 --> 02:57:48.559
SAM: Okay. Perception and awareness.

02:57:48.559 --> 02:57:50.305
TALIESIN: Yeah. Really quickly.

02:57:50.305 --> 02:57:56.789
SAM: Two successes, no fails.

02:57:56.789 --> 02:57:59.126
TALIESIN: Okay. That will do.

02:57:59.126 --> 02:58:06.263
LAURA: Oh. Kotori. That was the name. Yeah, that
was the name of the leader.

02:58:06.263 --> 02:58:15.592
TALIESIN: You suddenly feel a weird pressure as a
piece of wood comes bursting out of the front of

02:58:15.592 --> 02:58:16.608
your chest.

02:58:16.608 --> 02:58:18.386
(gasping)

02:58:18.386 --> 02:58:22.148
SAM: My family has chosen me.

02:58:22.148 --> 02:58:24.260
LAURA: Did he die?

02:58:24.260 --> 02:58:25.624
TALIESIN: He's not dead.

02:58:25.624 --> 02:58:27.356
LAURA: Sam!

02:58:27.356 --> 02:58:34.930
TALIESIN: But you do take four points of health
damage. Four serious points of health damage.

02:58:34.930 --> 02:58:39.918
LIAM: Babe, does it hurt?

02:58:39.918 --> 02:58:41.899
SAM: It hurts!

02:58:41.899 --> 02:58:44.929
LIAM: But in a bearable way?

02:58:44.929 --> 02:58:46.661
SAM: I'm going to try to shove it back through.

02:58:46.661 --> 02:58:50.479
TALIESIN: While you're doing that--

02:58:50.479 --> 02:58:54.364
SAM: Oh wait! I turn around to see who did it.

02:58:54.364 --> 02:58:56.109
TALIESIN: You're going to turn around and see who
did it?

02:58:56.109 --> 02:58:57.120
SAM: Yeah.

02:58:57.120 --> 02:59:00.135
TALIESIN: You turn around and it is, sadly, Satine
who had a stake there.

02:59:00.135 --> 02:59:02.467
SAM: Can I attack her?

02:59:02.467 --> 02:59:03.898
TRAVIS: She hated your dancing!

02:59:03.898 --> 02:59:05.596
TALIESIN: You can--

02:59:05.596 --> 02:59:09.299
LAURA: You shouldn't have tried to hit on that
girl after she told you no.

02:59:09.299 --> 02:59:10.755
LIAM: Yeah, they don't like it here.

02:59:10.755 --> 02:59:14.479
SAM: I was trying to find out who Yuri was!

02:59:14.479 --> 02:59:18.728
LIAM: Yuri Lowenthal is a popular actor in both
games and animation.

02:59:18.728 --> 02:59:21.648
SAM: Can I attack her?

02:59:21.648 --> 02:59:27.002
TALIESIN: Yeah. Roll a-- let's see, that was a
surprise run, so--

02:59:27.002 --> 02:59:30.436
SAM: Do I have to roll for initiative? How does this
work?

02:59:30.436 --> 02:59:36.083
TALIESIN: Give me a-- what, you're going to try
and attack her? Give me another wits brawl. Wits

02:59:36.083 --> 02:59:37.241
plus brawl.

02:59:37.241 --> 02:59:38.734
SAM: You want me to roll that?

02:59:38.734 --> 02:59:40.770
TALIESIN: Yeah, roll that, really quickly.

02:59:40.770 --> 02:59:42.636
SAM: Two success-- three successes.

02:59:42.636 --> 03:00:01.337
TALIESIN: Yeah, you attempt to and it does not go
well. She takes a swing with a knife.

03:00:01.337 --> 03:00:08.476
Roll a dex dodge. Oh boy.

03:00:08.476 --> 03:00:11.884
SAM: Three successes.

03:00:11.884 --> 03:00:13.434
LAURA: One critical success.

03:00:13.434 --> 03:00:16.840
TALIESIN: One critical success. Yeah, you manage
to stumble out of the way and now you're rolling

03:00:16.840 --> 03:00:25.996
with a piece of wood in your chest. You're now
rolling into the front stage. "No takers on that

03:00:25.996 --> 03:00:30.989
"one," Satine seems to say, looking at the three of
you. "Do you have something better to say?"

03:00:30.989 --> 03:00:35.084
LAURA: Oh man. Should we talk or is it best to--

03:00:35.084 --> 03:00:37.740
TALIESIN: The audience appears to be looking at
you. I can't tell you.

03:00:37.740 --> 03:00:40.388
SAM: (strained sounds)

03:00:40.388 --> 03:00:49.728
TRAVIS: So my wife and I, you know, I think we're
open to all scenarios at this point. I'm extremely

03:00:49.728 --> 03:00:58.817
strong. I'm not terribly ugly. I'll kill anybody
you want and I can also talk a lot less than that guy.

03:00:58.817 --> 03:01:03.228
TALIESIN: Suddenly, out of the crowd--

03:01:03.228 --> 03:01:06.894
SAM: (strained) He's never killed anyone! He
doesn't have any guts!

03:01:06.894 --> 03:01:13.178
TALIESIN: --Wil Wheaton slowly walks up to you and
gives you a big hug.

03:01:13.178 --> 03:01:15.591
LAURA: I give a big hug back. Please don't stab me
in the back.

03:01:15.591 --> 03:01:16.815
TALIESIN: He's going to stab you in the back.

03:01:16.815 --> 03:01:25.507
LAURA: I knew it. Why is he stabbing me?! Wil!
Titansgrave!

03:01:25.507 --> 03:01:27.967
TALIESIN: Roll dex dodge.

03:01:27.967 --> 03:01:31.561
LAURA: N-n-n-n-n-nineteen!

03:01:31.561 --> 03:01:32.593
TALIESIN: Roll dex dodge.

03:01:32.593 --> 03:01:34.251
TRAVIS: (singing) Five gold and a party!

03:01:34.251 --> 03:01:37.190
TALIESIN: Oh boy! Wil rolls really well when I'm
rolling for him.

03:01:37.190 --> 03:01:39.456
LAURA: Oh damn!

03:01:39.456 --> 03:01:44.939
TRAVIS: You're the alpha and omega of 20s and ones.
The two of you.

03:01:44.939 --> 03:01:47.202
LAURA: Two successes.

03:01:47.202 --> 03:01:59.334
TALIESIN: I'm going to let this be a succeed at a
cost. You give him a shove, but there's like a

03:01:59.334 --> 03:02:03.196
knife scrapes your back. As you shove away, you
take one point of damage.

03:02:03.196 --> 03:02:07.218
LAURA: One point of-- Is that marked off on the
health?

03:02:07.218 --> 03:02:08.429
TALIESIN: On the health. Yeah.

03:02:08.429 --> 03:02:15.886
LAURA: Okay. Why? I thought we were buds!

03:02:15.886 --> 03:02:24.085
LIAM: Geek and Sundry is in rubble. It's
destroyed. Marisha Ray is gone. You need someone

03:02:24.085 --> 03:02:31.623
to rebuild the studio and lead it creatively and
while I have no experience--

03:02:31.623 --> 03:02:34.717
TALIESIN: (laughs)

03:02:34.717 --> 03:02:36.578
LIAM: I use Presence Awe.

03:02:36.578 --> 03:02:37.956
TALIESIN: You use Presence Awe?

03:02:37.956 --> 03:02:38.804
LIAM: Yes.

03:02:38.804 --> 03:02:43.207
TALIESIN: On Wil? On Satine? On who? Erika is also
slowly walking towards you.

03:02:43.207 --> 03:02:44.995
LAURA: She's going to kill you.

03:02:44.995 --> 03:02:50.272
LIAM: I'll use it on Erika. No, Erika and I, we
bonded on Dread.

03:02:50.272 --> 03:02:52.153
TRAVIS: Sure you did. (laughs)

03:02:52.153 --> 03:02:53.595
LAURA: I thought Wil was my friend!

03:02:53.595 --> 03:02:54.851
LIAM: I will use it on Erika.

03:02:54.851 --> 03:02:55.950
TALIESIN: You're going to try and--

03:02:55.950 --> 03:03:06.327
LIAM: You and I, Erika, will rebuild Geek and
Sundry. We will create a nest of creativity and

03:03:06.327 --> 03:03:10.693
vampirism like the undead have never seen.

03:03:10.693 --> 03:03:13.575
TALIESIN: Roll your dice, man. That was good!

03:03:13.575 --> 03:03:15.668
LIAM: Charisma plus persuasion.

03:03:15.668 --> 03:03:19.381
LAURA: I got it because I didn't say anything.

03:03:19.381 --> 03:03:20.772
TRAVIS: Uh-huh.

03:03:20.772 --> 03:03:23.510
SAM: I got it because I &lt;i&gt;did&lt;/i&gt; say something.
(laughs)

03:03:23.510 --> 03:03:25.414
LAURA: Yeah, your speech was very poor. (laughs)

03:03:25.414 --> 03:03:29.299
TRAVIS: It was like the worst Walmart job
application ever.

03:03:29.299 --> 03:03:31.191
LAURA: It was so bad it scared me out of talking.

03:03:31.191 --> 03:03:35.125
TRAVIS: I work well with others and I'm quite
affable--

03:03:35.125 --> 03:03:38.202
LIAM: Two successes, one failure. Nothing on the
blood die.

03:03:38.202 --> 03:03:51.071
TALIESIN: She seems receptive to it. She's
starting to get that smile.

03:03:51.071 --> 03:03:59.523
LIAM: Remember those two days on Madness and
how fucking cool it was?

03:03:59.523 --> 03:04:04.879
TALIESIN: And then you feel shoved from behind.
Someone just shoves you from behind.

03:04:04.879 --> 03:04:13.030
LIAM: Erika. The magic we had, the theatre &lt;i&gt;we&lt;/i&gt;
had--

03:04:13.030 --> 03:04:19.886
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, that did it. And now a stake
hits you right in the back. Erika's still staring

03:04:19.886 --> 03:04:21.347
at you.

03:04:21.347 --> 03:04:24.185
LIAM: (strained) You want to help me, Erika?

03:04:24.185 --> 03:04:27.859
TALIESIN: "I do, but my boss would get really mad
at me."

03:04:27.859 --> 03:04:29.906
LIAM: (strained) Who is it?

03:04:29.906 --> 03:04:40.025
TALIESIN: And behind you is Felicia Day, staring
down going, "No. Oh no."

03:04:40.025 --> 03:04:41.774
LIAM: (strained) I'm clearly out-classed here.

03:04:41.774 --> 03:04:43.336
TALIESIN: "I know."

03:04:43.336 --> 03:04:51.893
SAM: Wait. I'm going to try-- I'm going to scream
a primal scream and say, I'll show you what a

03:04:51.893 --> 03:05:01.466
&lt;i&gt;real&lt;/i&gt; vampire is! And I'll run using my super
speed at Satine with the stake that's sticking out

03:05:01.466 --> 03:05:07.409
of my body and just hug her in the heart and try
to jam it into her chest.

03:05:07.409 --> 03:05:09.172
TALIESIN: Roll strength brawl.

03:05:09.172 --> 03:05:11.262
LAURA: What about Travis? Did nobody stab Travis?

03:05:11.262 --> 03:05:12.677
TALIESIN: No one stabbed Travis.

03:05:12.677 --> 03:05:17.608
SAM: Three successes, no fails.

03:05:17.608 --> 03:05:27.470
TALIESIN: It works! You are pinned to her and she
takes the pain and it's-- how much are we doing

03:05:27.470 --> 03:05:35.284
here? Stakes are mean. You haven't-- and I'm going
to let her, since you're now top to bottom and

03:05:35.284 --> 03:05:47.843
you're holding on. Okay. She is going to just take
her knife and start cutting your head right off.

03:05:47.843 --> 03:05:49.607
SAM: Can I dodge it?

03:05:49.607 --> 03:05:51.884
TALIESIN: You are literally pinned to her like a
thumbtack.

03:05:51.884 --> 03:05:53.914
SAM: But I have an incredibly fast response time.

03:05:53.914 --> 03:05:54.884
TALIESIN: You do.

03:05:54.884 --> 03:06:01.838
SAM: My initiative doubles, can use dodge skill
against firearms.

03:06:01.838 --> 03:06:06.331
TALIESIN: I was about to say, you can try to dodge
out of the way. That was a really good-- you just

03:06:06.331 --> 03:06:09.151
knocked her and she went straight up for it so you
should try.

03:06:09.151 --> 03:06:10.712
SAM: So what am I rolling?

03:06:10.712 --> 03:06:16.323
TALIESIN: That would be a-- that's your initiative
roll, so it would be a dex dodge.

03:06:16.323 --> 03:06:22.449
SAM: Dex dodge. Two successes.

03:06:22.449 --> 03:06:28.315
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, no. Yeah, you're looking pretty
rough.

03:06:28.315 --> 03:06:30.124
SAM: I'm going to take more points.

03:06:30.124 --> 03:06:34.460
TALIESIN: That was five more points of health.

03:06:34.460 --> 03:06:37.083
SAM: I'm dead. That's it.

03:06:37.083 --> 03:06:39.326
TALIESIN: You're starting to powder on the floor.

03:06:39.326 --> 03:06:47.820
LIAM: (strained) Felicia, I'm a big fan of Dr.
Horrible, &lt;i&gt;big&lt;/i&gt; fucking fan of Dr. Horrible. I get

03:06:47.820 --> 03:06:53.601
it. Tough love. We're ready. (normal voice) I use
Awe again. Presence Awe again.

03:06:53.601 --> 03:06:55.517
LAURA: On the Grand Poobah.

03:06:55.517 --> 03:06:57.095
LIAM: (strained) That's right. I do.

03:06:57.095 --> 03:06:58.858
TALIESIN: Roll a blood die and then roll a...

03:06:58.858 --> 03:07:14.655
LIAM: Loyal as the day is long. Okay. Three
successes, no failures.

03:07:14.655 --> 03:07:18.452
SAM: (laughs)

03:07:18.452 --> 03:07:22.290
LAURA: I saved your life!

03:07:22.290 --> 03:07:26.852
LIAM: Ten thousand years of Day. And not the bad
kind.

03:07:26.852 --> 03:07:35.088
TALIESIN: "I'm really sorry, Liam, but this is
just not the kind of content we're really looking

03:07:35.088 --> 03:07:40.509
"to make right now. But, really, thank you for
everything. Thank you for all of this and I'm so

03:07:40.509 --> 03:07:48.671
"sorry. Sorry. It's going to hurt a little. I'm
trying to make it not hurt. Sorry!" And she takes

03:07:48.671 --> 03:07:57.838
a stab. Pushes a little deeper. Yeah, you're
staked and down and you're not probably getting

03:07:57.838 --> 03:07:59.790
back up.

03:07:59.790 --> 03:08:02.386
LAURA: I'm just slashed across the back still?

03:08:02.386 --> 03:08:04.081
TALIESIN: Yeah.

03:08:04.081 --> 03:08:15.095
TRAVIS: If I could, my wife is a fantastic person
and she understands how valuable the relationship

03:08:15.095 --> 03:08:22.993
between the vampire world and the human world is
and how much it must be protected. Such a delicate

03:08:22.993 --> 03:08:23.919
balance.

03:08:23.919 --> 03:08:28.021
LAURA: I read a lot of vampire novels, I've watched a
lot of movies.

03:08:28.078 --> 03:08:33.450
TRAVIS: We are here to disappear and never cause a
bit of trouble and only to learn.

03:08:33.450 --> 03:08:37.376
LAURA: I played a vampire in Skyrim, and in
Bloodrayne.

03:08:37.376 --> 03:08:41.017
TALIESIN: "Yeah, but she tastes of death."

03:08:41.017 --> 03:08:44.024
TRAVIS: I knew it. (laughs)

03:08:44.024 --> 03:08:52.155
LAURA: Here's the thing. Nobody told us we weren't
supposed to do that. I didn't know. It was fight

03:08:52.155 --> 03:08:58.746
or flight at that point and as soon we got out to
the real world and we were around actual humans

03:08:58.746 --> 03:09:00.332
and I realised it wasn't the apocalypse--

03:09:00.332 --> 03:09:01.472
TRAVIS: She was very remorseful.

03:09:01.472 --> 03:09:02.956
LAURA: I kept him from killing somebody!

03:09:02.956 --> 03:09:07.189
TRAVIS: I would have taken a life if it hadn't
been for her. If one of us can only enter this

03:09:07.189 --> 03:09:10.092
world, I would ask that it be her.

03:09:10.092 --> 03:09:14.532
LAURA: Oh, babe. That's really sweet. No, I'm not
okay with that.

03:09:14.532 --> 03:09:19.357
LIAM: (strained) You were supposed to protect me!

03:09:19.357 --> 03:09:21.974
(laughter)

03:09:21.974 --> 03:09:29.670
TRAVIS: Oh yeah. I'm sorry. I suddenly feel
this lingering shame and guilt. But as the person

03:09:29.670 --> 03:09:32.194
who applied it is now dead, I don't feel--

03:09:32.194 --> 03:09:34.897
TALIESIN: Make a charisma persuasion roll.

03:09:34.897 --> 03:09:37.646
LAURA: Can I help him? Can I aid him?

03:09:37.646 --> 03:09:39.004
TALIESIN: Yeah, you can help him.

03:09:39.004 --> 03:09:40.020
LAURA: What do I do?

03:09:40.020 --> 03:09:41.794
TALIESIN: Charisma persuasion. You just add your
successes together.

03:09:41.794 --> 03:09:42.852
LAURA: Okay.

03:09:42.852 --> 03:09:51.642
TALIESIN: You could burn a willpower.

03:09:51.642 --> 03:09:52.984
TRAVIS: I will burn a willpower.

03:09:52.984 --> 03:09:55.315
TALIESIN: You can reroll any you like, as many as
you like.

03:09:55.315 --> 03:10:03.188
LAURA: I have a critical success. I have two tens,
and two more successes outside of that. So four

03:10:03.188 --> 03:10:04.700
successes, two of them are critical.

03:10:04.700 --> 03:10:09.053
TRAVIS: I now have five successes and no
failures.

03:10:09.053 --> 03:10:18.869
TALIESIN: Out of the back room runs Mary
Elizabeth, who goes, "I'll take that one! It's

03:10:18.869 --> 03:10:20.627
"okay. I've got this one."

03:10:20.627 --> 03:10:22.536
LAURA: Mary, which one? Travis or--

03:10:22.536 --> 03:10:23.444
TALIESIN: "You."

03:10:23.444 --> 03:10:24.765
LAURA: You're taking me? You're going to adopt
me?

03:10:24.765 --> 03:10:29.057
TALIESIN: She takes you and goes over.

03:10:29.057 --> 03:10:32.918
LAURA: Oh my god. What about Stove?

03:10:32.918 --> 03:10:37.986
TALIESIN: Satine walks over to you and goes, "Oh
no, you're fine. You don't smell of death."

03:10:37.986 --> 03:10:47.849
TRAVIS: Oh good. No, I would &lt;i&gt;never have&lt;/i&gt; stepped
into that-- that's a fool's errand. I know better.

03:10:47.849 --> 03:10:53.553
TALIESIN: "Well then, we will say, welcome to the
Tremere family."

03:10:53.553 --> 03:10:55.622
TRAVIS: The Tremere family!

03:10:55.622 --> 03:11:03.408
TALIESIN: "And welcome to the Toreador family.
We'll train you, we will talk and we will see what else--"

03:11:03.408 --> 03:11:06.211
LAURA: Are we cool that we're still married and
we're in different families?

03:11:06.211 --> 03:11:07.352
TALIESIN: "Oh yes."

03:11:07.352 --> 03:11:08.432
LAURA: Okay, cool.

03:11:08.432 --> 03:11:12.777
TALIESIN: "We will sleep for the day and then in
the morning we will figure out precisely what it

03:11:12.777 --> 03:11:17.952
"is that you can do and who may have been
responsible for creating you in the first place."

03:11:17.952 --> 03:11:22.452
TRAVIS: Do I get a hint as to who my honorable
sponsor might be?

03:11:22.452 --> 03:11:24.558
LAURA : It's Satine!

03:11:24.558 --> 03:11:25.626
TALIESIN: Satine.

03:11:25.626 --> 03:11:26.727
TRAVIS: Oh, fantastic.

03:11:26.727 --> 03:11:27.953
TALIESIN: Satine's taking you.

03:11:27.953 --> 03:11:29.294
TRAVIS: I'm thrilled.

03:11:29.294 --> 03:11:32.977
TALIESIN: Well done for not--

03:11:32.977 --> 03:11:34.659
TRAVIS: She's a really good sponsor!

03:11:34.659 --> 03:11:42.724
TALIESIN: And with that, they lead you to the
basement of the club, where there are clean, fresh

03:11:42.724 --> 03:11:44.949
coffins for everybody to sleep in.

03:11:44.949 --> 03:11:47.435
LAURA: What happens to those dead bodies that are
up there?

03:11:47.435 --> 03:11:49.851
TALIESIN: They're powder.

03:11:49.851 --> 03:11:53.350
LIAM: As we're dying, I reach my hand and finds
Sam's.

03:11:53.350 --> 03:11:54.765
SAM: I hold his hand.

03:11:54.765 --> 03:11:58.165
LIAM: As we're fading away: (dying voice) Why is
our life so ridiculous?

03:11:58.165 --> 03:12:00.933
SAM: (dying voice) On the next episode of All Work
No Play!

03:12:00.933 --> 03:12:08.336
TALIESIN: Wow, I was really hoping to TPK
everyone, but you guys made it through the

03:12:08.336 --> 03:12:11.683
evening. All you had to do was to kill Diva and
that would have been the fucking end of it.

03:12:11.683 --> 03:12:14.463
LAURA: I saved you! See, it was good!

03:12:14.463 --> 03:12:17.152
TALIESIN: Thank you, everybody, for letting me--

03:12:17.152 --> 03:12:19.076
LAURA: Wait, what happened to Taliesin?

03:12:19.076 --> 03:12:20.718
TALIESIN: You don't know what happened to
Taliesin.

03:12:20.718 --> 03:12:22.696
TRAVIS: What do you mean, we don't 
know what happened to Taliesin?

03:12:22.696 --> 03:12:24.467
TALIESIN: I know what happened to Taliesin.

03:12:24.467 --> 03:12:26.432
TRAVIS: Could we have found him in the one-shot?

03:12:26.432 --> 03:12:27.547
TALIESIN: Yeah.

03:12:27.547 --> 03:12:28.668
TRAVIS and LAURA: We missed him?!

03:12:28.668 --> 03:12:29.718
TALIESIN: Yeah.

03:12:29.718 --> 03:12:31.497
LIAM: There was no Taliesin in the champagne
room.

03:12:31.497 --> 03:12:33.305
LAURA: Oh no, was he upstairs with the
werewolves?

03:12:33.305 --> 03:12:34.117
TALIESIN: No.

03:12:34.117 --> 03:12:35.909
TRAVIS: We're not going to have a Talks this week
because it's Halloween.

03:12:35.909 --> 03:12:37.511
TALIESIN: Yeah, Taliesin was in the back room.

03:12:37.511 --> 03:12:39.059
LIAM: He's here, tonight?

03:12:39.059 --> 03:12:40.293
TRAVIS: Where Mary came from?

03:12:40.293 --> 03:12:41.242
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm.

03:12:41.242 --> 03:12:44.007
SAM: Wait, the back room where Mary was or the
back room where--

03:12:44.007 --> 03:12:46.428
LAURA: Wait a minute. How come Taliesin didn't
come to our defense?

03:12:46.428 --> 03:12:53.118
TALIESIN: Because he was in a cage. It's a long
story. We'll get there one day. Taliesin was not

03:12:53.118 --> 03:12:57.167
doing well. He may have done some bad things.

03:12:57.167 --> 03:13:00.390
LIAM: May have. Wow.

03:13:00.390 --> 03:13:05.993
TALIESIN: Yeah, I've got to say, this is a
wonderful system that I'm a very big fan of and

03:13:05.993 --> 03:13:08.134
thank you all for joining me in this ridiculousness.

03:13:08.134 --> 03:13:09.814
TRAVIS: Nicely done!

03:13:09.814 --> 03:13:16.719
TALIESIN: I was really hoping to give you guys the
TPK you all wanted but fucking Laura just had to

03:13:16.719 --> 03:13:22.280
be a good guy and let Diva live. It's okay. It's
great. She saved your ass, man.

03:13:22.280 --> 03:13:23.291
TRAVIS: Yeah.

03:13:23.291 --> 03:13:29.199
TALIESIN: And then you saved hers, to be fair. She
was going to go, too.

03:13:29.199 --> 03:13:33.182
LIAM: I'll see you in your dreams, Friedle.

03:13:33.182 --> 03:13:40.388
TALIESIN: So if you guys want the v5 alpha,
there's a little playthrough online that you can

03:13:40.388 --> 03:13:45.765
find. I'm sure someone in the chat can lead you to
it. Also, Onyx has got reams of stories of the old

03:13:45.765 --> 03:13:51.756
books for this game, including Live Action
Role-Playing. There used to be these great City by

03:13:51.756 --> 03:13:57.571
Night books: LA by Night, New York by Night and
all these wonderful references. I always love

03:13:57.571 --> 03:14:01.698
that you can pull interesting-- these are great
characters for pulling weird historical bits of

03:14:01.698 --> 03:14:08.980
different cities out, because some of these people
actually lived to see it, which is always fun. So

03:14:08.980 --> 03:14:14.292
yeah, look up the lizard people in LA and
those were fun. Those were real things and Los

03:14:14.292 --> 03:14:16.469
Globos is a weird little club in LA.

03:14:16.469 --> 03:14:17.648
TRAVIS: Still up and running?

03:14:17.648 --> 03:14:22.238
TALIESIN: Still up and running. It's where Das
Bunker happens and sorry, Diva, for-- thank god we

03:14:22.238 --> 03:14:28.204
did not kill Diva and Manzey. We love you both
very much. And thank you for everybody who's

03:14:28.204 --> 03:14:33.409
watched this evening. Thank you for everybody who
offered to be a sacrifice for this episode. I did

03:14:33.409 --> 03:14:38.162
see you, but I was not prepared to kill Critters
yet and thank you for not killing the one Critter

03:14:38.162 --> 03:14:41.984
I gave you. Although I would have been really
interested to see if you guys had eaten lizard

03:14:41.984 --> 03:14:45.821
people. That was an option. Their blood would have
been weird.

03:14:45.821 --> 03:14:47.846
TRAVIS: Starts taking some of its
characteristics?

03:14:47.846 --> 03:14:53.276
TALIESIN: Yeah. I had some interesting rules I
brewed up for eating lizard people and how it

03:14:53.276 --> 03:14:59.663
would affect you. This has been fun. This has been
exhausting. I can't believe Matt Mercer does this

03:14:59.663 --> 03:15:07.757
&lt;i&gt;every&lt;/i&gt; week. I'm ready to pull my mohawk off. I
may have already pulled my mohawk off. Oh god. And

03:15:07.757 --> 03:15:10.650
next week, it's going to be you.

03:15:10.650 --> 03:15:14.796
TRAVIS: My turn. Yeah. Actually, Grog's turn. It's
not me.

03:15:14.796 --> 03:15:16.843
LAURA: Grog is DM.

03:15:16.843 --> 03:15:20.307
TALIESIN: Thank you everybody. I hope you have a
wonderful Halloween weekend if you have time

03:15:20.307 --> 03:15:29.102
tomorrow. Thank you to our sponsor, Tor Books. And
if you have time to check out some of our other

03:15:29.102 --> 03:15:33.254
shows, we've got Madness this weekend that you can
check out and Gather Your Party tomorrow, where

03:15:33.254 --> 03:15:35.095
I'm going to be wearing something super fancy.

03:15:35.095 --> 03:15:36.557
TRAVIS: Brilliant.

03:15:36.557 --> 03:15:41.518
TALIESIN: Yeah. Thank you all, have a pleasant
evening and is it Thursday night yet?

03:15:41.518 --> 03:15:43.868
TRAVIS: Happy Halloween!

03:15:43.868 --> 03:15:47.075
TALIESIN: Happy Halloween! (evil laughter)

03:15:47.075 --> 03:24:49.668
