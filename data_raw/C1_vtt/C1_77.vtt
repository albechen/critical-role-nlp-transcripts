00:00:00.196 --> 00:00:03.921
MATT: Hello everyone, and welcome to tonight's
episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us

00:00:03.921 --> 00:00:11.455
nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play
Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons. Tonight is going to be

00:00:11.455 --> 00:00:15.185
interesting based on where we left off last time,
but before we get to all of that, let me get

00:00:15.185 --> 00:00:19.793
through tonight's announcements for you guys so we
can get to the game proper. For those of you who

00:00:19.793 --> 00:00:24.369
are drinking: first shot, there you go. First and
foremost, tonight's episode is brought to you by

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:25.880
our good friends at Loot Crate!

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:27.378
ALL: Loot Crate!

00:00:27.378 --> 00:00:30.448
MATT: Sam, did you want to take us away?

00:00:30.448 --> 00:00:35.924
SAM: Guys! Loot Crate has a brand new theme for
December, Revolution! They're always watching,

00:00:35.924 --> 00:00:39.702
they've designed a system to keep you down,
they're meddlesome, it's time for a revolution!

00:00:39.702 --> 00:00:47.444
Here's the thing. Every week I do these sort of
funny bits about Loot Crate. This week, it's going

00:00:47.444 --> 00:00:54.495
to be hard for me, because-- to get real with you
guys for a second-- my son, this morning, at his

00:00:54.495 --> 00:00:58.794
preschool they found that his pre-school's bunny
has deceased.

00:00:58.794 --> 00:01:00.871
(sympathetic noises)

00:01:00.871 --> 00:01:04.167
SAM: And so they wanted me-- I talked to some of
the kids. Some of the kids are actually-- they

00:01:04.167 --> 00:01:13.734
like the show? And they asked if I could bring the
bunny in a Loot Crate to pay tribute.

00:01:13.734 --> 00:01:16.336
LAURA: I do not believe you. You're not--

00:01:16.336 --> 00:01:24.614
SAM: So it's here. Because this makes the bunny
sort of part of the show. And the kids and the

00:01:24.614 --> 00:01:30.256
parents helped a little, they wrote a little
something to commemorate the bunny and I'm going

00:01:30.256 --> 00:01:38.627
to read that for the kids. For the kids! What can
be said about Dennis the Hopper? The bestest bunny

00:01:38.627 --> 00:01:45.095
the Little Explorer's classroom ever had, the way
he always jumped left paw first, or nibbled on

00:01:45.095 --> 00:01:50.639
Olivia's Yo Gabba Gabba backpack? The way he
pooped whenever Maddie picked him up. We'll miss

00:01:50.639 --> 00:01:57.725
your floppy ears, your soft fur, but most of all,
your inner beauty. Love, the Little Explorers:

00:01:57.725 --> 00:02:04.680
Maddie, Olivia, Salinger, Paris, Justice, Woodley,
Appalonia, DeGrass, Garvey, Barack, Sashimi,

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.601
Neptune, Sevigny, Coachella, Aaliyah, Walnut, and
Kevin.

00:02:09.601 --> 00:02:16.486
MARISHA: To be fair, that sounds like a southern
California school. Silverlake!

00:02:16.486 --> 00:02:25.412
SAM: And now to honor their request to make the
bunny part of Critical Role forever, I'm going to--

00:02:25.412 --> 00:02:27.102
TRAVIS: Don't touch it, man!

00:02:27.102 --> 00:02:32.364
SAM: We'll miss you, Dennis.

00:02:32.364 --> 00:02:36.950
TRAVIS: How long has that chicken been sitting in
that box?

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:38.886
SAM: Little long.

00:02:38.886 --> 00:02:40.930
(laughter)

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:42.623
LIAM: Hi to PETA, by the way.

00:02:42.623 --> 00:02:48.768
TRAVIS: Fucking hell. We have these amazing Loot
Crate DX boxes!

00:02:48.768 --> 00:02:56.801
MATT: Go to lootcrate.com/criticalrole and use the promo code
CriticalRole, one word, you get 10% off your first

00:02:56.801 --> 00:03:01.961
month of Loot Crate. Sam couldn't say that because
his mouth is full of bunny. But let's go ahead and open.

00:03:01.961 --> 00:03:06.967
MARISHA: The DX boxes aren't the clothes boxes,
are they?

00:03:06.967 --> 00:03:09.441
LAURA: No, no no. That's Loot Crate Clothes. But
wait!

00:03:09.441 --> 00:03:12.651
MATT: That's actually really cool.

00:03:12.651 --> 00:03:17.558
LAURA: Is there Gears of War stuff in here? I
thought there might be.

00:03:17.558 --> 00:03:20.952
MATT: All about the Harry Potter blanket.

00:03:20.952 --> 00:03:25.067
LAURA: Shut up!

00:03:25.067 --> 00:03:30.972
TRAVIS: I'm a Baratheon, man, this means a lot to
me!

00:03:30.972 --> 00:03:38.232
MATT: Look at this blanket, guys: Wanded, and
Extremely Dangerous.

00:03:38.232 --> 00:03:42.044
MARISHA: It's going to take me the whole unboxing
to get it open.

00:03:42.044 --> 00:03:43.879
TRAVIS: Holy shit!

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:47.915
TALIESIN: There's a Witcher Wild Hunt medallion
paperweight.

00:03:47.915 --> 00:03:50.146
MATT: I need more of these medallions, by the
way.

00:03:50.146 --> 00:03:53.539
LIAM: Is that an Eye of Acomodo for my shirt?!

00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:55.451
LAURA: What's the Harry Potter thing?

00:03:55.451 --> 00:03:57.447
TRAVIS: It's a Hogwarts book clip.

00:03:57.447 --> 00:03:59.093
MATT: You're slowly becoming more and more
your character.

00:03:59.093 --> 00:04:00.824
LIAM: Yeah, he talks just like this!

00:04:00.824 --> 00:04:05.977
TALIESIN: This is not kidding around, this is kind
of intense!

00:04:05.977 --> 00:04:08.228
SAM: Does that go on your car, what is that?

00:04:08.228 --> 00:04:12.010
TALIESIN: It's a paperweight. You could brain
somebody with this.

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:16.089
MATT: This will be a murder weapon in some case
over the next year.

00:04:16.089 --> 00:04:17.895
TRAVIS: This is so legit!

00:04:17.895 --> 00:04:20.174
TALIESIN: That's a bottle opener right there.

00:04:20.174 --> 00:04:25.385
TRAVIS: Since 1963, drawing what acid does to your
brain.

00:04:25.385 --> 00:04:27.663
LAURA: Thanks, Loot Crate!

00:04:27.663 --> 00:04:37.028
MARISHA: This is my further transformation to
actually becoming Melisandre in School of Thrones.

00:04:37.028 --> 00:04:43.550
SAM: Did we show this yet?

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:55.562
MARISHA: Yeah, if anyone doesn't know, Matt
produced, and I helped him in it, we were in this

00:04:55.562 --> 00:05:01.189
web series called School of Thrones, like four
years ago. You make a cameo in it.

00:05:01.189 --> 00:05:03.056
TALIESIN: Yeah, I have a cameo in it.

00:05:03.056 --> 00:05:04.736
MATT: It's ridiculous.

00:05:04.736 --> 00:05:11.938
MARISHA: It's basically Game of Thrones in a John
Hughes film. Just watch it.

00:05:11.938 --> 00:05:13.377
MATT: Watch it!

00:05:13.377 --> 00:05:16.649
LAURA: I really like this.

00:05:16.649 --> 00:05:18.986
TALIESIN: I'm stealing some of this stuff.

00:05:18.986 --> 00:05:27.093
TRAVIS: I'm a Slytherin prefect, you need to go to
bed, Mr. Mercer. I apparently have an accent for

00:05:27.093 --> 00:05:28.441
some reason.

00:05:28.441 --> 00:05:32.042
SAM: Guys, I'm going to keep the box in case the
preschool's parrot dies.

00:05:32.042 --> 00:05:34.724
TRAVIS: Yeah, you going to start a pet cemetery?

00:05:34.724 --> 00:05:47.052
MATT: Awesome. Thank you, Loot Crate. As a heads
up, guys, next week on December 6th from 6:00 to

00:05:47.052 --> 00:05:51.276
7:00pm, they're doing a Puzzle Quest special
stream here on Geek &amp;amp; Sundry, and a number of us

00:05:51.276 --> 00:05:57.065
are going to be there with Ivan. Big thank you to
Magic the Gathering Puzzle Quest for putting this

00:05:57.065 --> 00:06:01.625
together. You guys probably remember back in
September a few of us showed up for Game the Game

00:06:01.625 --> 00:06:07.289
Goes Critical, and thanks to you guys supporting
that show, they've come back to have us go ahead and do

00:06:07.289 --> 00:06:12.477
this again. So we'll be here next Tuesday from
6:00 to 7:00, leading right up into Talks Machina,

00:06:12.477 --> 00:06:18.425
messing around. You can check out their game,
Magic the Gathering Puzzle Quest, on iOS and

00:06:18.425 --> 00:06:20.904
Android devices, and we'll see you guys hopefully
next Tuesday.

00:06:20.904 --> 00:06:23.146
(air horn)

00:06:23.146 --> 00:06:24.518
SAM: Whoa!

00:06:24.518 --> 00:06:27.459
TRAVIS: Wow. That's so appropriate.

00:06:27.459 --> 00:06:29.284
LIAM: That's my butt!

00:06:29.284 --> 00:06:31.954
MATT: I approve now. If that happens during the
game at any given point in time, that's

00:06:31.954 --> 00:06:33.300
disadvantage.

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:34.877
(air horn)

00:06:34.877 --> 00:06:39.271
MATT: Unless it's really funny.

00:06:39.271 --> 00:06:41.442
LIAM: Sound the horns.

00:06:41.442 --> 00:06:48.122
MATT: Choose carefully, Liam. Choose carefully.
It's like telling a kid he can choose his own

00:06:48.122 --> 00:06:54.918
punishment, it's dangerous. Also, we're helping
support the amazing charity, Worldbuilders, with

00:06:54.918 --> 00:06:58.355
Patrick Rothfuss and a number of other great
authors. You can find out more at

00:06:58.355 --> 00:07:03.524
worldbuilders.org. They bring the power of readers
and writers and all that type of creativity

00:07:03.524 --> 00:07:08.604
together, to raise money to help make the world a
better place. Go check it out, it's a wonderful

00:07:08.604 --> 00:07:12.394
group and we'll hopefully be doing more things
with them coming up in the near future. Those

00:07:12.394 --> 00:07:16.584
announcements will come as we go forward, but
Patrick Rothfuss, who's a friend of the show, was

00:07:16.584 --> 00:07:17.850
a guest on Critical Role--

00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:19.727
LIAM: I'm not really very familiar with Patrick
Rothfuss--

00:07:19.727 --> 00:07:22.593
MATT: You should read some of his stuff, it's
pretty good, he's a good writer. And apparently is

00:07:22.593 --> 00:07:24.655
now making a show with Lin-Manuel.

00:07:24.655 --> 00:07:28.242
MARISHA: I hear they're besties. He's actually my
new bestie.

00:07:28.242 --> 00:07:30.140
MATT: That's right, yeah, you got a cool ring.

00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:33.079
MARISHA: Yeah, he gave me a ring, yeah. My new
best friend.

00:07:33.079 --> 00:07:34.828
SAM: He put a ring on it?!

00:07:34.828 --> 00:07:40.401
TALIESIN: It is the six degrees of Lin-Manuel now,
isn't it? Kevin Bacon has been unthroned.

00:07:40.401 --> 00:07:45.332
MATT: We're all slowly making our way towards
getting him on the show. That's the goal.

00:07:45.332 --> 00:07:47.839
TALIESIN: Lin-Manuel, on the show.

00:07:47.839 --> 00:07:49.648
LIAM: I'm willing to wait for it.

00:07:49.648 --> 00:07:52.858
MARISHA: Lin-Manuel, on this show. This one.

00:07:52.858 --> 00:08:00.701
MATT: Next up, this next Monday, actually, we are
doing the final wrap-up episode of Force Grey:

00:08:00.701 --> 00:08:07.883
Giant Hunters live at the Egyptian Theater here in
Hollywood from 5:00-8:30pm next Monday. We'll also

00:08:07.883 --> 00:08:11.579
be streaming it. The tickets are free, by the way,
so if you're in the vicinity, go ahead and get

00:08:11.579 --> 00:08:15.962
some tickets, come join us. We have a great cast,
a couple of new members are joining in for this.

00:08:15.962 --> 00:08:20.563
It's going to be a lot of fun and a great finale
for the Force Grey series. Those who watched the

00:08:20.563 --> 00:08:25.769
Acquisitions Inc series and their PAX game, there
might be a few fun little nods in there as well.

00:08:25.769 --> 00:08:29.591
So, anyway, much love to you guys if you can make
it, if not we'll see you on Twitch on Monday

00:08:29.591 --> 00:08:35.768
regardless! And last but not least, here on Geek &amp;amp;
Sundry there is coming up the Dick and Johnson

00:08:35.768 --> 00:08:43.731
Ultimate Christmas Special, with lots of familiar
faces. Zach Carr is DMing this, it's a kick ass

00:08:43.731 --> 00:08:47.145
and chew bubblegum game, I'm sure you've seen it
probably on Game the Game before, it's a great

00:08:47.145 --> 00:08:55.561
game. It's been on a few other projects here. But
Hector and Keller, they're going to be playing

00:08:55.561 --> 00:09:00.548
through your favorite BFF duo to save everything
in the world. There might be some cameos, a bunch

00:09:00.548 --> 00:09:06.023
of rapid-fire cameos throughout the show, so check
out the Dick and Johnson Save Christmas special at

00:09:06.023 --> 00:09:11.188
December 12, at 4:00pm Pacific here on Twitch.
It's going to be fun.

00:09:11.188 --> 00:09:12.725
TRAVIS: That is the best name.

00:09:12.725 --> 00:09:19.117
MATT: Might be showing up off screen, just to
heckle people. Or more. We'll find out. All right,

00:09:19.117 --> 00:09:20.562
any other announcements?

00:09:20.562 --> 00:09:23.685
LIAM: Yeah, she's trying to keep it on the down
low, but Laura doesn't have any of her dice,

00:09:23.685 --> 00:09:27.259
really. She has three sets instead of the usual
ten.

00:09:27.259 --> 00:09:31.411
LAURA: I brought my bag of dice home for the
holiday and then I didn't bring it--

00:09:31.411 --> 00:09:32.951
SAM: Why did you bring it home?

00:09:32.951 --> 00:09:38.033
LAURA: I maybe was going to give some of our dice
to our winners for the costume contest.

00:09:38.033 --> 00:09:39.551
SAM: But instead--

00:09:39.551 --> 00:09:41.896
LAURA: I just left them at home.

00:09:41.896 --> 00:09:44.154
SAM: I have a bag of dice in there that I've never
used.

00:09:44.154 --> 00:09:50.274
LAURA: I have a lot of dice, I just don't have all my
dice, you guys. I still have a bunch up here.

00:09:50.274 --> 00:09:54.078
TRAVIS: She literally has 300 over here.

00:09:54.078 --> 00:09:56.549
LAURA: I do, I have a lot. But thank you!

00:09:56.549 --> 00:09:58.102
TALIESIN: We're doomed.

00:09:58.102 --> 00:10:01.721
MARISHA: Speaking of charities, before we go on.
Speaking of charities, I would still like to give

00:10:01.721 --> 00:10:10.078
a shout-out to 826LA, who we so love and support.
They're great. People will send us tweets being

00:10:10.078 --> 00:10:15.188
like, "Hey, do you guys still support 826LA?"
Always, I don't think you can stop supporting

00:10:15.188 --> 00:10:16.551
826LA.

00:10:16.551 --> 00:10:20.460
TALIESIN and MARISHA: I don't know, they know what
they did.

00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:23.995
TALIESIN: And they have their own shop also, and
if you're interested you can go and shop at 826,

00:10:23.995 --> 00:10:29.276
and they have super cool posters and books. And
buttons, and all sorts of stuff that you can get

00:10:29.276 --> 00:10:31.593
that they put out that are super super cool.

00:10:31.593 --> 00:10:36.227
MARISHA: And I've seen people take you up on your
suggestion that it's always a great date place.

00:10:36.227 --> 00:10:37.753
TALIESIN: It is such a good date place.

00:10:37.753 --> 00:10:40.105
MARISHA: We've had people tweet at us and be like,
we took you up on that, and it is a good date

00:10:40.105 --> 00:10:42.589
place, because they have cute store fronts, so you
should go.

00:10:42.589 --> 00:10:46.764
TALIESIN: Yeah. The actual quality of the date is
not guaranteed, but the quality of the venue--

00:10:46.764 --> 00:10:48.982
MARISHA and TALIESIN: No. That depends on you.

00:10:48.982 --> 00:10:50.560
MARISHA: And we can't help that.

00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:52.621
SAM: Could you do a wedding there if you wanted
to?

00:10:52.621 --> 00:10:53.678
TALIESIN: A very small one.

00:10:53.678 --> 00:10:55.206
SAM: Or a bar mitzvah, or maybe a bris?

00:10:55.206 --> 00:10:57.176
TALIESIN: A very small wedding, or a wedding with
small people.

00:10:57.176 --> 00:10:59.672
SAM: All right.

00:10:59.672 --> 00:11:08.125
MATT: All righty then. On that note, unless anyone
else has anything to say we are going to

00:11:08.125 --> 00:11:12.819
dive into tonight's episode of Critical Role.

00:11:12.819 --> 00:12:46.918
[dramatic music]

00:12:46.918 --> 00:12:54.901
MATT: Welcome back, everyone. Including my party.
Who need to calm the fuck down.

00:12:54.901 --> 00:12:56.986
(laughter)

00:12:56.986 --> 00:12:58.483
LIAM: Party!

00:12:58.483 --> 00:13:04.356
MATT: So, picking up where we left off last time.
The group of intrepid adventurers known as Vox

00:13:04.356 --> 00:13:09.587
Machina have been making their way through their
quest to take down the Chroma Conclave, a group of

00:13:09.587 --> 00:13:14.971
chromatic dragons who have been terrorizing the
countryside in Tal'Dorei under the rule of Thordak

00:13:14.971 --> 00:13:21.711
the Cinder King, a great, powerful, and seemingly
elementally charged ancient red dragon who sits in

00:13:21.711 --> 00:13:25.872
the center of the city of Emon. After gathering
the rest of the artifacts you guys have been

00:13:25.872 --> 00:13:31.362
seeking, called the Vestiges of Divergence, the
last one being found in the City of Brass upon the

00:13:31.362 --> 00:13:38.942
Fire Elemental Plane, you traveled back to Fort
Daxio, a northern fort north of Emon, where you

00:13:38.942 --> 00:13:44.185
were planning a trap of some kind for Thordak.
Upon arriving with two charges of yours, two

00:13:44.185 --> 00:13:52.528
previously enslaved celestial-blooded boys that
you found in the City of Brass, you all traveled

00:13:52.528 --> 00:13:58.641
across the planes, with the help of Keyleth, back
to Fort Daxio to find the landscape scarred with

00:13:58.641 --> 00:14:06.279
recent flame and apparently a battle raging at the
outer gate. That is where we left off. So, you

00:14:06.279 --> 00:14:12.340
guys, looking northward, you can see the large
plumes of black smoke billowing up from the

00:14:12.340 --> 00:14:15.658
direction of the fort. The outer wall seems to
have sustained some damage. You can see a number

00:14:15.658 --> 00:14:20.254
of flying entities swooping in. Dozens of them,
while you can hear the distant sound of combat,

00:14:20.254 --> 00:14:26.662
shouts and battle. You guys, as you land and
realize this, you can see the two slaves, who have

00:14:26.662 --> 00:14:31.925
now been freed and taken with you, both look
immediately wide eyed and freaked out and closed

00:14:31.925 --> 00:14:33.565
off. What are you guys doing?

00:14:33.565 --> 00:14:35.024
TRAVIS: This is fine.

00:14:35.024 --> 00:14:37.002
MARISHA: So much safer here, kids.

00:14:37.002 --> 00:14:38.445
LAURA: We need to get them safe.

00:14:38.445 --> 00:14:41.618
SAM: Who safe? The place is on fire. They're not
safe.

00:14:41.618 --> 00:14:44.065
LAURA: I take off on my broom and fly up in the
air.

00:14:44.065 --> 00:14:46.227
SAM: Ah! Wait! You forgot your hat!

00:14:46.227 --> 00:14:50.962
LAURA: I want to see up and over the wall and see
what's going on on the inside.

00:14:50.962 --> 00:14:56.129
MATT: Okay. So you fly up and head up over the
front wall.

00:14:56.129 --> 00:14:58.082
LAURA: I don't want to go in, I just want to
look.

00:14:58.082 --> 00:15:01.784
MATT: Right. So you fly up and get a vantage point
to see what's going on over the wall.

00:15:01.784 --> 00:15:03.106
LAURA: Yes.

00:15:03.106 --> 00:15:07.260
TRAVIS: You're going to get seen.

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:15.077
MATT: As you crest up in the air, you notice that
there are a number of soldiers currently battling

00:15:15.077 --> 00:15:22.457
possibly a hundred or more lizard men that have
swarmed into the fort, as well as a number of--

00:15:22.457 --> 00:15:26.902
and go ahead and make a perception check actually to
see if you can make some good detailed elements out.

00:15:26.902 --> 00:15:29.122
TRAVIS: First roll of the night.

00:15:29.122 --> 00:15:34.196
LAURA: First roll, first roll, first roll. Here we
go. 27.

00:15:34.196 --> 00:15:39.995
MATT: 27. All right. These are wyvern riders. This
is a group of wyvern riders, with lizard men, that

00:15:39.995 --> 00:15:50.214
have swooped in. You can see a number of the siege
elements that have been built by Percy over there,

00:15:50.214 --> 00:15:53.955
some have been firing off on the inside or at
least ones that were installed in the actual fort

00:15:53.955 --> 00:15:59.646
base. You also see a distant explosion, a flash of
light on one of the walls on the inside. There is

00:15:59.646 --> 00:16:03.665
the outer wall, and there is a courtyard in the
actual fortress itself. The front gates to the

00:16:03.665 --> 00:16:07.569
inner courtyard have already been breached, and
most of the battle is happening inside the main

00:16:07.569 --> 00:16:08.842
courtyard.

00:16:08.842 --> 00:16:10.658
TRAVIS: Are we outside the courtyard or inside?

00:16:10.658 --> 00:16:15.625
MATT: As you're noticing this, you watch as two
wyverns are now swooping in your direction from

00:16:15.625 --> 00:16:18.002
the outside of the outer wall.

00:16:18.002 --> 00:16:19.410
SAM: Because they saw you.

00:16:19.410 --> 00:16:21.079
MARISHA: So we're on the outside of the wall?

00:16:21.079 --> 00:16:26.164
MATT: You guys are far south, probably a good
quarter-mile south of the fort, on the outside of

00:16:26.164 --> 00:16:27.433
the wall.

00:16:27.433 --> 00:16:29.664
TALIESIN: I say we starting making our way and
deal with this.

00:16:29.664 --> 00:16:32.339
LAURA: Yeah. I draw-- are they close enough to
shoot them?

00:16:32.339 --> 00:16:36.171
MATT: You can wait until they're close enough.
They're a little bit out of your range right now.

00:16:36.171 --> 00:16:40.275
TALIESIN: Is it possible they're out of Bad News'
range or is that even humanly possible?

00:16:40.275 --> 00:16:45.951
MATT: You know what, as of right now, you could
probably hit one of them with Bad News.

00:16:45.951 --> 00:16:50.884
TALIESIN: All right. I double check. Speak now or
forever hold your peace, I'm doing this.

00:16:50.884 --> 00:16:53.500
MATT: What's the long range on it?

00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:55.018
TALIESIN: 1,200.

00:16:55.018 --> 00:16:58.446
MATT: Okay. You bear down and you--

00:16:58.446 --> 00:17:00.602
TALIESIN: 1,200 feet. 1,200 feet.

00:17:00.602 --> 00:17:06.802
MATT: Yeah. Go for it. And Laura, you still have
to wait at this point. You're readying your shot.

00:17:06.802 --> 00:17:10.684
LAURA: Yeah. But I Hunter's Mark one of them.

00:17:10.684 --> 00:17:13.500
MATT: Okay. Aiming for--

00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:15.405
LAURA: Oh wait, it's probably a ranged thing too.

00:17:15.405 --> 00:17:20.043
MATT: It's okay. You're currently selecting a
wyvern or the rider to fire at?

00:17:20.043 --> 00:17:24.038
LAURA: The rider.

00:17:24.038 --> 00:17:33.047
TALIESIN: All right. Taking a shot. Oh, that'll
do! 30.

00:17:33.047 --> 00:17:39.619
MATT: The explosion from the front of the muzzle
of Bad News fires off, the spark and flame and

00:17:39.619 --> 00:17:46.677
smoke billowing forth. The shot has no impact. It
looks like, from gauging at this distance, it was

00:17:46.677 --> 00:17:48.234
just outside of the range.

00:17:48.234 --> 00:17:50.786
LAURA: Oh, they're 1,200 feet away, they're that
far?

00:17:50.786 --> 00:17:54.578
MATT: It's hard to gauge really, at that distance,
whether or not they were there, but apparently the

00:17:54.578 --> 00:17:57.457
bullet lost momentum by the time it reached their
position.

00:17:57.457 --> 00:17:58.727
TALIESIN: Okay. Reload.

00:17:58.727 --> 00:17:59.865
MARISHA: Let's move in.

00:17:59.865 --> 00:18:03.706
LAURA: Can I shout down and yell, get the boys
safe! But I don't know who I'm shouting it to,

00:18:03.706 --> 00:18:05.177
just one of you guys--

00:18:05.177 --> 00:18:06.545
TRAVIS: More impassioned.

00:18:06.545 --> 00:18:08.258
LAURA: (yelling) Get the boys safe!

00:18:08.258 --> 00:18:10.842
SAM: Oh my god. We have to get these boys to
safety.

00:18:10.842 --> 00:18:12.689
TRAVIS: Do we?

00:18:12.689 --> 00:18:20.337
MARISHA: Why don't we have them run? Have them
run. Yeah. I grab them and I say, run that way.

00:18:20.337 --> 00:18:24.434
Don't die. They're good.

00:18:24.434 --> 00:18:26.110
LAURA: Seriously?

00:18:26.110 --> 00:18:29.185
TALIESIN: Actually, I've got a better idea.

00:18:29.185 --> 00:18:30.313
MARISHA: What?

00:18:30.313 --> 00:18:31.906
TALIESIN: Hand them one of the stones.

00:18:31.906 --> 00:18:35.209
MARISHA: All right, yeah, sure. I hand them a
gatestone.

00:18:35.209 --> 00:18:38.437
TALIESIN: We'll find you when it's safe. Hide
wherever you need to. Stay away from the castle.

00:18:38.437 --> 00:18:40.531
We will find you when it's safe.

00:18:40.531 --> 00:18:42.350
MARISHA: Hide in the bushes, don't go far.

00:18:42.350 --> 00:18:43.689
SAM: Or go anywhere.

00:18:43.689 --> 00:18:48.518
MATT: They nod and they take the stone, and they
start running off towards the western edge of this

00:18:48.518 --> 00:18:53.501
valley, which has the two cliffsides that come
into the valley here. A lot of the nearby brush

00:18:53.501 --> 00:18:56.920
appears to have been burned on the way.

00:18:56.920 --> 00:19:00.545
MARISHA: Oh, fuck. I say, try and stay unseen!

00:19:00.545 --> 00:19:09.623
MATT: They go darting off, keeping low, and you
get the sense that they're used to fleeing, so

00:19:09.623 --> 00:19:13.502
they dart off, arm in arm, rushing off towards the
side of the valley wall.

00:19:13.502 --> 00:19:15.942
SAM: So they're gone forever.

00:19:15.942 --> 00:19:19.183
MATT: You have time to reload before they get
close enough for her to fire, so if you want to

00:19:19.183 --> 00:19:20.651
take another shot.

00:19:20.651 --> 00:19:22.434
TALIESIN: Sure. I'll take another shot.

00:19:22.434 --> 00:19:24.649
LAURA: Should I hang out and wait or should we--

00:19:24.649 --> 00:19:32.219
TALIESIN: Actually, let's head as a group towards
this. I say we run and we take everything that's

00:19:32.219 --> 00:19:37.257
heading towards us. I'll wait until they're close
enough that I can get a good--

00:19:37.257 --> 00:19:38.882
MARISHA: We all charge for the gate.

00:19:38.882 --> 00:19:41.382
MATT: Okay, so you guys are all charging towards
the outer gate. What are you doing, Vex? You watch

00:19:41.382 --> 00:19:42.853
the rest of your party darting--

00:19:42.853 --> 00:19:46.221
MARISHA: I Message to Vex, and I say, what do you
see? How many wyverns are there? Do you see any

00:19:46.221 --> 00:19:47.538
dragons?

00:19:47.538 --> 00:19:49.666
LAURA: Do I see any dragons?

00:19:49.666 --> 00:19:51.898
MATT: Currently you do not see any dragons at
the--

00:19:51.898 --> 00:19:56.242
LAURA: I don't see any dragons, but it looks like
about a hundred enemies.

00:19:56.242 --> 00:19:59.301
SAM: Hundred! Is that true? I missed that one.

00:19:59.301 --> 00:20:00.710
MATT: Yes.

00:20:00.710 --> 00:20:02.126
TRAVIS: That's a lot.

00:20:02.126 --> 00:20:03.693
SAM: (laughing) That's more than two.

00:20:03.693 --> 00:20:05.301
TRAVIS: Is it?

00:20:05.301 --> 00:20:06.942
LIAM: What do you sense? Do you sense dragons?

00:20:06.942 --> 00:20:09.098
LAURA: Well, that's going to take a minute.

00:20:09.098 --> 00:20:10.401
LIAM: I'd work on that.

00:20:10.401 --> 00:20:15.506
SAM: All right, let's just charge in blindly!
There's no cover out here, right?

00:20:15.506 --> 00:20:16.737
MATT: There is no cover.

00:20:16.737 --> 00:20:19.397
SAM: Let's take out those fucking riders.

00:20:19.397 --> 00:20:26.760
MARISHA: We have an Avengers moment. We're
running. Like Guardians of the Galaxy!

00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:28.773
TRAVIS: That's like Chariots of Fire. You're doing
the wrong music.

00:20:28.773 --> 00:20:33.489
MARISHA: Okay, you know what, any movie where they
run in slow motion toward something, which happens

00:20:33.489 --> 00:20:34.602
a lot.

00:20:34.602 --> 00:20:39.915
MATT: There you go. As you guys are charging
towards the blown-open gates to the outer

00:20:39.915 --> 00:20:45.640
courtyard of Fort Daxio, with Vex swooping down on
her broom with the bow out, you watch as these

00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:52.092
wyvern riders come swooping down in your
direction. Their claws extended, their tails and

00:20:52.092 --> 00:20:57.892
stingers out forward, they come swooping down. Go
ahead and take a shot. You can take a shot as well.

00:20:57.892 --> 00:21:00.883
TALIESIN: I'm taking my first shot. I'm also
making it a wing shot.

00:21:00.883 --> 00:21:03.822
LAURA: So I Hunter's Marked them as soon as they
were close enough.

00:21:03.822 --> 00:21:10.464
MATT: Yes. Hunter's Mark. There's two, and a third
one has joined, a little behind now. They're

00:21:10.464 --> 00:21:13.672
coming upon you. Which one do you Hunter's Mark?

00:21:13.672 --> 00:21:15.343
LAURA: The one that's biggest?

00:21:15.343 --> 00:21:17.140
MATT: Hard to gauge at this distance.

00:21:17.140 --> 00:21:18.512
LAURA: The one that's closest.

00:21:18.512 --> 00:21:19.730
MATT: Okay, there you go.

00:21:19.730 --> 00:21:21.309
TALIESIN: Wing shot, first one.

00:21:21.309 --> 00:21:24.789
LAURA: And I am a third level rogue now.

00:21:24.789 --> 00:21:26.147
TALIESIN: 30.

00:21:26.147 --> 00:21:32.885
LAURA: So I get advantage on my attack, if they
haven't attacked me yet, right? If they haven't

00:21:32.885 --> 00:21:34.413
taken a turn?

00:21:34.413 --> 00:21:36.543
MATT: I believe, looking at the specifics there--

00:21:36.543 --> 00:21:41.941
LAURA: As an assassin? At your third level, you
get advantage if you get the drop, if they haven't

00:21:41.941 --> 00:21:43.659
taken a turn yet.

00:21:43.659 --> 00:21:45.460
MATT: Technically--

00:21:45.460 --> 00:21:49.042
LAURA: They're moving?

00:21:49.042 --> 00:21:52.978
MATT: They know you're around. This is less like
they haven't acted yet. They've been acting. Every

00:21:52.978 --> 00:21:57.290
round, they've been dashing toward you. So you do
not have the drop on them, as they've been making

00:21:57.290 --> 00:21:59.358
a beeline since the beginning. Apologies.

00:21:59.358 --> 00:22:02.914
LAURA: Well, all right. I guess I'll just have a
32 attack, then.

00:22:02.914 --> 00:22:07.462
MATT: Okay, I want you and Percy to both roll
damage on those attacks, as these are both guided

00:22:07.462 --> 00:22:09.249
at the same individual.

00:22:09.249 --> 00:22:10.725
TALIESIN: Okay.

00:22:10.725 --> 00:22:24.761
LAURA: 21, and then-- That is awesome.

00:22:24.761 --> 00:22:32.007
TALIESIN: 26 points of damage, and he has to make
a strength save against becoming prone.

00:22:32.007 --> 00:22:34.434
LAURA: Do I get sneak attack on this?

00:22:34.434 --> 00:22:37.187
MATT: No, you would not, unfortunately.

00:22:37.187 --> 00:22:39.739
LAURA: Okay, so it's just 21 damage, with four of
lightning.

00:22:39.739 --> 00:22:47.663
MATT: Okay! So, as you hear the explosion at the
front of the muzzle of Bad News take off, the

00:22:47.663 --> 00:22:52.016
arrow whizzing through the air, both impacting
into each side of the wyvern, you watch as one of

00:22:52.016 --> 00:22:56.413
its wings tears open. It tumbles forward, the
rider thrown off its back and clutching onto its

00:22:56.413 --> 00:23:01.809
reins, flipping over the side as it corkscrews and
slams into the ground about 150, 200 feet behind

00:23:01.809 --> 00:23:03.528
you, skidding across the dirt.

00:23:03.528 --> 00:23:05.408
LAURA: Oh, I didn't do Hunter's Mark damage!

00:23:05.408 --> 00:23:06.718
MATT: Go for it.

00:23:06.718 --> 00:23:08.340
LAURA: An additional three.

00:23:08.340 --> 00:23:15.871
MATT: Okay. Effectively slammed and left behind in
the dust right now, it's going to have to get up

00:23:15.871 --> 00:23:19.352
and rush to try and catch up to you guys. The
other two are swooping down now and have managed

00:23:19.352 --> 00:23:20.616
to get up--

00:23:20.616 --> 00:23:21.793
LAURA: Do I get my second attack?

00:23:21.793 --> 00:23:25.608
MATT: You do get your second attack, yes. You
could as well, for your round.

00:23:25.608 --> 00:23:26.960
LAURA: 21.

00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:28.186
MATT: Hits.

00:23:28.186 --> 00:23:30.074
TALIESIN: Same thing, with a drop.

00:23:30.074 --> 00:23:35.681
SAM: Can I extend my arm, with my Wand of
Fireballs ready to shoot?

00:23:35.681 --> 00:23:38.397
MATT: Yeah, actually.

00:23:38.397 --> 00:23:41.901
LAURA: 18 damage.

00:23:41.901 --> 00:23:44.148
SAM: How far are they?

00:23:44.148 --> 00:23:47.353
MATT: At this point, they're maybe 150 feet from
you.

00:23:47.353 --> 00:23:49.534
TALIESIN: I don't crit on a 19 yet, do I?

00:23:49.534 --> 00:23:50.593
MATT: No.

00:23:50.593 --> 00:23:52.236
MARISHA: Do you ever get that?

00:23:52.236 --> 00:23:54.122
MATT: At a higher level.

00:23:54.122 --> 00:23:56.083
LAURA: Trinket crits on a 19.

00:23:56.083 --> 00:23:58.900
MATT: Trinket's cool like that.

00:23:58.900 --> 00:24:03.100
MARISHA: Why can't you be Trinket? We love the
bear more than you, Percy.

00:24:03.100 --> 00:24:07.785
TALIESIN: Oh, I know. 32 to hit.

00:24:07.785 --> 00:24:12.699
MATT: And the save? What's the DC, again?

00:24:12.699 --> 00:24:14.870
TALIESIN: I believe it's--

00:24:14.870 --> 00:24:17.295
MATT: You have to write down your DC, man.

00:24:17.295 --> 00:24:20.936
TALIESIN: I used to. Oh, 19. It's there, I just
couldn't see.

00:24:20.936 --> 00:24:25.761
MATT: There you go. This one now, as you guys
both-- you pull back and release your second

00:24:25.761 --> 00:24:33.079
arrow, and you take Bad News, reload it, and then
fire again-- you watch as this time, one of the

00:24:33.079 --> 00:24:39.236
wings breaks at the hinge. It folds under itself.
The rider, this time, as opposed to holding on, is

00:24:39.236 --> 00:24:43.657
thrown and plummets the rest of the distance,
hitting the ground with a very heavy (splat)

00:24:43.657 --> 00:24:47.646
against the stonework, his head scattering. The
wyvern ends up slamming into the ground and

00:24:47.646 --> 00:24:50.978
skidding off into a big cloud of dust behind you
as well, as you guys continue pushing forward.

00:24:50.978 --> 00:24:57.290
However, that does complete your round. The last
one does swoop down and is going to-- You're

00:24:57.290 --> 00:24:59.775
making the loudest noise and got the most
attention, so it's going to swoop in your

00:24:59.775 --> 00:25:05.415
direction, Percival. It's going to come on down,
it's going to make two attacks on you, and then

00:25:05.415 --> 00:25:13.541
harry and lift up. That's with its bite. That's
going to be a miss. It goes to snatch at you with

00:25:13.541 --> 00:25:19.660
its bite, and you duck out of the way. However,
the stinger comes up from behind. That is a 19 to hit.

00:25:19.660 --> 00:25:23.660
TALIESIN: That just barely hits.

00:25:23.660 --> 00:25:30.297
MATT: Just barely hits? Okay. As the stinger slams
into your shoulder, that is ten points of piercing

00:25:30.297 --> 00:25:33.295
damage. I need you to make a constitution saving
throw.

00:25:33.295 --> 00:25:39.420
TALIESIN: One of those again, okay. Ten points of
damage and a constitution saving throw.

00:25:39.420 --> 00:25:44.380
TRAVIS: (singing) Roll high, you blue-haired
motherfucker.

00:25:44.380 --> 00:25:48.066
SAM: It's, like, blue and purple.

00:25:48.066 --> 00:25:51.133
TALIESIN: I'm going to do a Resolve.

00:25:51.133 --> 00:25:54.145
MATT: Okay, to take that saving throw again? Go
for it.

00:25:54.145 --> 00:26:00.979
TALIESIN: That's even worse. Do I have to take the
worse one for the Resolve?

00:26:00.979 --> 00:26:03.283
MATT: It's whatever you rolled the second time, I
think.

00:26:03.283 --> 00:26:06.457
TALIESIN: Can I burn another Resolve, just to fuck
it, because this is annoying me?

00:26:06.457 --> 00:26:10.154
LIAM: If it's like Luck, it's a no.

00:26:10.154 --> 00:26:14.979
MATT: Let me double check, just a moment.

00:26:14.979 --> 00:26:16.543
LAURA: Does it petrify you?

00:26:16.543 --> 00:26:18.417
TALIESIN: I'll find out!

00:26:18.417 --> 00:26:26.253
MATT: All right, so. This is your Indomitable? Not
Resolve, your Indomitable. You must use the new roll.

00:26:26.253 --> 00:26:28.896
TALIESIN: Okay, that's a 12.

00:26:28.896 --> 00:26:35.475
MATT: A 12? No. All right, so, as the poison
courses through your body, the stinger itself

00:26:35.475 --> 00:26:40.301
pulling forth, you see a bit of black-greenish
liquid spill out as it pulls itself out of the

00:26:40.301 --> 00:26:52.844
wound. You suffer 24 points of poison damage as it
then lifts back up out of range and is going to

00:26:52.844 --> 00:26:55.856
circle around. You guys all still running? You see
Percy get hit.

00:26:55.856 --> 00:26:57.901
SAM: Can I take my Fireball shot?

00:26:57.901 --> 00:27:02.081
MATT: You can now. Because it was coming very
close before you had the opportunity to hit, it

00:27:02.081 --> 00:27:06.017
swings up past and you can now, reaching behind,
get a Fireball wand shot if you want.

00:27:06.017 --> 00:27:08.531
SAM: I will take my Fireball wand shot.

00:27:08.531 --> 00:27:10.423
LIAM: How high in the air is it?

00:27:10.423 --> 00:27:15.388
MATT: At this point now, as it swooped past, it's
about 40, 45 feet away? A safe enough distance for

00:27:15.388 --> 00:27:17.702
the Fireball to not blow up his own party.

00:27:17.702 --> 00:27:20.927
SAM: It's got a DC of 15, that wand.

00:27:20.927 --> 00:27:24.520
MATT: That is a no. It rolled a three. So go ahead
and roll damage.

00:27:24.520 --> 00:27:28.700
SAM: Can I fire more than one charge, or should I
have said that already?

00:27:28.700 --> 00:27:30.630
MATT: You should have said that at the beginning.
It's a basic.

00:27:30.630 --> 00:27:32.296
SAM: Never mind. So, it's 8d6, right?

00:27:32.296 --> 00:27:34.739
MATT: 8d6, you got it. And what are you doing,
Vax?

00:27:34.739 --> 00:27:36.883
LIAm: If I can attack, I'm throwing daggers.

00:27:36.883 --> 00:27:41.283
MATT: Yeah, you can do that, as it sweeps past
after getting the rapid stinger into the chest.

00:27:41.283 --> 00:27:45.819
LIAM: First gets 26, second is a 19.

00:27:45.819 --> 00:27:47.913
MATT: Okay, both hit.

00:27:47.913 --> 00:27:49.937
LIAM: Okay, dagger, dagger, dagger.

00:27:49.937 --> 00:27:51.273
SAM: 33.

00:27:51.273 --> 00:28:10.027
LIAM: 14 for the first, and the second is eight.
That's it. It's within 40 feet, you said?

00:28:10.027 --> 00:28:12.046
MATT: Yeah, as it swoops past.

00:28:12.046 --> 00:28:24.753
LIAM: I am going to Channel Divinity and use a Vow
of-- oh, I can't. Can I ditch the second attack?

00:28:24.753 --> 00:28:27.713
MATT: Nah, you've already confirmed it.

00:28:27.713 --> 00:28:33.722
SAM: Also, Matthew, I don't know if this affects
anything. I am exhausted. Does that change

00:28:33.722 --> 00:28:35.149
anything?

00:28:35.149 --> 00:28:37.207
MATT: Correct. You have one point of exhaustion,
which means that your ability checks are at

00:28:37.207 --> 00:28:42.743
disadvantage. Keyleth, Grog, do you guys want to
do anything while it passes overhead?

00:28:42.743 --> 00:28:44.562
MARISHA: You go first.

00:28:44.562 --> 00:28:46.996
TRAVIS: No, please, ladies first. No, I insist.

00:28:46.996 --> 00:28:52.464
MARISHA: Okay. I run to Percy and I grab and pick
him up and keep running, and I say, let me know if

00:28:52.464 --> 00:28:53.752
you're poisoned.

00:28:53.752 --> 00:28:55.290
TALIESIN: Do I feel--?

00:28:55.290 --> 00:29:01.982
MATT: It was a burning pain through your body, but
it subsided after the original poison coursed

00:29:01.982 --> 00:29:05.238
through your body. So you fought it off
sufficiently afterward.

00:29:05.238 --> 00:29:09.201
MARISHA: Okay, I help him up and I say, come on!
And we keep running.

00:29:09.201 --> 00:29:11.052
MATT: Okay, you guys keep running. Grog?

00:29:11.052 --> 00:29:13.266
TRAVIS: The one that Vax shot that hit the
ground--

00:29:13.266 --> 00:29:14.676
LAURA: I'm Vex.

00:29:14.676 --> 00:29:16.046
TRAVIS: Yeah, whatever.

00:29:16.046 --> 00:29:17.455
MATT: Yeah, that's 200 feet behind you.

00:29:17.455 --> 00:29:18.664
TRAVIS: Oh, it's 200 feet.

00:29:18.664 --> 00:29:22.107
MATT: You guys have been running this whole time
as it went overhead and crashed into the ground

00:29:22.107 --> 00:29:23.326
behind you.

00:29:23.326 --> 00:29:24.394
TRAVIS: Oh, I'm good.

00:29:24.394 --> 00:29:28.155
MATT: Okay, you guys just keep running? Okay. So,
as you guys continue to run forward, it swings

00:29:28.155 --> 00:29:35.021
around after the Fireball detonates, and you see
it wobble in the air for a second. 33 points. The

00:29:35.021 --> 00:29:40.511
rider has turned to ash, blown off the top of it.
The wyvern, however, has still found its target

00:29:40.511 --> 00:29:45.138
and turns around and on its own is swooping back
towards the group of you guys. You're now about

00:29:45.138 --> 00:29:55.412
halfway towards the front gate of the keep, of Fort
Daxio. You guys, both Percy and Vex, with ranged

00:29:55.412 --> 00:29:58.549
weapons, you can take your shot now as it's
turning around and returning to you guys, still

00:29:58.549 --> 00:29:59.662
charging forward.

00:29:59.662 --> 00:30:00.742
LAURA: Hunter's Mark!

00:30:00.742 --> 00:30:03.362
MATT: All right, so you move your Hunter's Mark
over to that guy? Go for it.

00:30:03.362 --> 00:30:05.236
LAURA: 25.

00:30:05.236 --> 00:30:07.180
MATT: That hits.

00:30:07.180 --> 00:30:18.538
LAURA: 23.

00:30:18.538 --> 00:30:23.213
MATT: All right. 23 damage, nice. All righty.

00:30:23.213 --> 00:30:25.030
LAURA: On the first arrow.

00:30:25.030 --> 00:30:26.785
MATT: Yes. Second one?

00:30:26.785 --> 00:30:33.652
LAURA: That is, what, 23? Yeah. 23.

00:30:33.652 --> 00:30:35.454
TRAVIS and LAURA: 22.

00:30:35.454 --> 00:30:43.242
MATT: Right, so there's five plus three for this,
and it's plus eight damage-- Oh, to hit! Okay.

00:30:43.242 --> 00:30:47.707
Both hit. I was like, that's really high damage
for arrows! My apologies.

00:30:47.707 --> 00:30:54.160
TRAVIS: Two ones in a row.

00:30:54.160 --> 00:31:00.819
LAURA: Shut up! Ugh! 13.

00:31:00.819 --> 00:31:02.663
MATT: 13 damage?

00:31:02.663 --> 00:31:04.431
LAURA: Three ones in a row!

00:31:04.431 --> 00:31:09.416
TRAVIS: I guess you've got to throw those dice
away! Only 900 left.

00:31:09.416 --> 00:31:14.649
MATT: So running forward, you turn around behind,
over your shoulder. You switch your actual direction

00:31:14.649 --> 00:31:18.755
of arrows you normally fire with and turn the
other way. Both arrows sink into it and you see it

00:31:18.755 --> 00:31:20.677
wobble in the air. Percy.

00:31:20.677 --> 00:31:27.225
TALIESIN: I'm going to take, on the fall-down, I
put Bad News away and I pull Animus out because

00:31:27.225 --> 00:31:34.502
it's closer now. So I can take easier pot shots at
it. 31.

00:31:34.502 --> 00:31:36.257
MATT: Hits.

00:31:36.257 --> 00:31:38.425
TALIESIN: How many shots, can I take a full round
of shots, or--?

00:31:38.425 --> 00:31:39.666
MATT: You can if you want to.

00:31:39.666 --> 00:31:43.409
TALIESIN: I'll take a full round. 31. 26.

00:31:43.409 --> 00:31:44.829
MATT: 26 hits.

00:31:44.829 --> 00:31:48.974
TALIESIN: And 33.

00:31:48.974 --> 00:31:51.067
MATT: All three hit. Go ahead and roll damage.

00:31:51.067 --> 00:32:10.671
TALIESIN: Where are my d10s at? That's not a d10.
There we go. That's three shots, it's 17--

00:32:10.671 --> 00:32:18.841
SAM: So much math!

00:32:18.841 --> 00:32:26.911
TALIESIN: I'm making sure I do this right
because-- 24 points, 34 points, 41 points of

00:32:26.911 --> 00:32:28.279
damage plus--

00:32:28.279 --> 00:32:32.671
MATT: Not on one hit. That's all of his attacks.

00:32:32.671 --> 00:32:39.065
TALIESIN: Three, it's three, yeah. 41 points of
damage plus ten points of psychic damage.

00:32:39.065 --> 00:32:40.556
MATT: Nice.

00:32:40.556 --> 00:32:43.435
TALIESIN: That was three shots.

00:32:43.435 --> 00:32:50.587
MATT: All righty, so all three shots pelt it in
the chest. You can see giant sections of its meaty

00:32:50.587 --> 00:32:55.523
chest blown open and it's streaking dark wyvern
blood behind it. However, it's still flying. The

00:32:55.523 --> 00:33:00.235
fervor on its face as it's near death is causing
it to get more intense as it swoops down toward

00:33:00.235 --> 00:33:05.227
you. Streaking out, the tail ends up curling
beneath. It's going to take a shot toward you,

00:33:05.227 --> 00:33:08.909
Percy, as you were the one that most recently hit
it and did the most damage. With the bite, that is

00:33:08.909 --> 00:33:13.693
a 24 to hit.

00:33:13.693 --> 00:33:15.105
TALIESIN: Oh, that hits.

00:33:15.105 --> 00:33:18.280
MATT: And the stinger is at only a 13 to hit.

00:33:18.280 --> 00:33:19.904
TALIESIN: That does not hit!

00:33:19.904 --> 00:33:24.676
MATT: So, the stinger, seeing it coming this way,
you duck out of the way. However, its giant wyvern

00:33:24.676 --> 00:33:29.281
jaws clamp down and streak across your shoulder as
the momentum pulls it past, dragging it across the

00:33:29.281 --> 00:33:36.040
back. For that, you suffer ten points of piercing
damage.

00:33:36.040 --> 00:33:38.178
MARISHA: That's not too bad.

00:33:38.178 --> 00:33:42.535
MATT: As it comes down at that point, it's back in
range for any of you melee folk that want to take

00:33:42.535 --> 00:33:45.084
a swing at it. Grog?

00:33:45.084 --> 00:33:49.143
TRAVIS: Can I rage, and can I take a swing at
Falcor, please?

00:33:49.143 --> 00:33:50.285
MATT: Yes, you can!

00:33:50.285 --> 00:33:52.210
TRAVIS: Okay! Lovely.

00:33:52.210 --> 00:33:56.401
LIAM: We have no initiative, so I don't know who's
where. Am I close enough to go after Grog?

00:33:56.401 --> 00:34:00.331
MATT: Yes. I'm keeping tabs because this is more
of a flyby as you guys are running.

00:34:00.331 --> 00:34:02.751
TRAVIS: Could I make it a reckless attack,
please?

00:34:02.751 --> 00:34:04.892
MATT: Sure, yeah. A lot of these are happening
simultaneously.

00:34:04.892 --> 00:34:09.430
TRAVIS: 25.

00:34:09.430 --> 00:34:12.162
MATT: That hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

00:34:12.162 --> 00:34:21.430
TRAVIS: Nine, 22, plus two points of necrotic,
24.

00:34:21.430 --> 00:34:25.792
MATT: Okay, as it swoops down and bites into
Percy's arm as it drags up in the air, you watch

00:34:25.792 --> 00:34:28.975
as a very fast-running Grog, who's been ahead of
the group at this point, his speed is higher than

00:34:28.975 --> 00:34:35.312
anybody, spins around, axe in the air, and carves
right through the front of its chest to its back.

00:34:35.312 --> 00:34:39.894
It (screeching) and slides into two pieces that
then scatter into the ground, smearing black

00:34:39.894 --> 00:34:44.695
darkness across the dry, desert floor. You guys
continue to run forward. Currently, all your

00:34:44.695 --> 00:34:50.036
harrying wyverns are way too far behind and
damaged or not paying attention, before you guys

00:34:50.036 --> 00:34:54.500
are just now reaching the outside of the busted Fort
Daxio outer wall, where the front gates are

00:34:54.500 --> 00:34:56.999
collapsed inward and slightly burned.

00:34:56.999 --> 00:34:59.988
TRAVIS: Didn't seem like that big of a problem.
That was not so tough.

00:34:59.988 --> 00:35:03.167
LAURA: There's a hundred more guys inside, Grog!

00:35:03.167 --> 00:35:06.760
TRAVIS: I know, you keep saying that number, like
I know what it means, so let's get it on.

00:35:06.760 --> 00:35:10.600
MARISHA: Grog, Grog! 100 needs three hands to
make.

00:35:10.600 --> 00:35:11.941
TRAVIS: How many hands?

00:35:11.941 --> 00:35:13.081
MARISHA: It needs--

00:35:13.081 --> 00:35:14.334
TRAVIS: How many?

00:35:14.334 --> 00:35:15.481
LAURA: Keep running!

00:35:15.481 --> 00:35:17.690
MARISHA: Okay. Keep running! Keep running!

00:35:17.690 --> 00:35:19.460
TALIESIN: It's not helpful.

00:35:19.460 --> 00:35:22.608
MATT: You guys all go into the front gates?

00:35:22.608 --> 00:35:25.356
LAURA: I'm on the broom, so I'm up and over the
wall.

00:35:25.356 --> 00:35:29.712
MATT: Okay. You come up over the top of the wall.
As you get up over the top, immediately you see

00:35:29.712 --> 00:35:35.005
they have two large ballistae. The number of
ballistae installed throughout the walls here, two

00:35:35.005 --> 00:35:40.332
of them have already been torn apart and whoever
was manning them is lying on the ground, torn open

00:35:40.332 --> 00:35:44.679
and dead. But you do also see other dead
lizardmen. It looks like a fight has been

00:35:44.679 --> 00:35:48.409
going on for a short time here and has been a back
and forth. As you guys come into the main courtyard,

00:35:48.409 --> 00:35:55.184
you find the ground is charred with small flames
that are still burning on bushes, and elements of

00:35:55.184 --> 00:36:00.491
piles of broken wood and things that were part of
the encampment that just caught fire. You can see

00:36:00.491 --> 00:36:06.981
groups of lizardmen battling various soldiers,
some of them still screaming and the sound of

00:36:06.981 --> 00:36:12.586
lizard-like battle cries as they charge in,
slamming weapon against weapon, shield against

00:36:12.586 --> 00:36:19.183
face. This is an actual small-scale war happening
inside here. It's hard to tell which side is

00:36:19.183 --> 00:36:23.091
winning. A lot of the soldiers are better-trained,
but occasionally you watch as a wyvern swoops down

00:36:23.091 --> 00:36:27.859
and picks up a soldier and throws them off the
side, and slams into the ground, no longer

00:36:27.859 --> 00:36:29.259
moving.

00:36:29.259 --> 00:36:31.033
MARISHA: Do we see anyone we know?

00:36:31.033 --> 00:36:32.794
SAM: Where's Elle?

00:36:32.794 --> 00:36:34.188
MARISHA: Do we see Allura?

00:36:34.188 --> 00:36:36.381
MATT: Perception check.

00:36:36.381 --> 00:36:41.700
MARISHA: Come on, opal dice. That's not bad! 26.

00:36:41.700 --> 00:36:43.390
SAM: Oh, disadvantage.

00:36:43.390 --> 00:36:45.130
MATT: Disadvantage for you, buddy.

00:36:45.130 --> 00:36:46.601
SAM: Oh, okay. 14.

00:36:46.601 --> 00:36:52.657
MATT: Okay. So the two of you, as soon as you dart
inside and glance over, you can see nobody that

00:36:52.657 --> 00:36:58.682
catches your familiar eye. Everyone who is in
armor is in full armor. They're all in the actual

00:36:58.682 --> 00:37:06.811
Fort Daxio defense regalia and they are covered in
blood, they're covered in soot and they are not

00:37:06.811 --> 00:37:10.332
paying attention to you because they are fighting
for their lives right now. You can see there are

00:37:10.332 --> 00:37:16.314
a number of tents to the side, dried trees that have
burnt out entirely. You can see a number of the

00:37:16.314 --> 00:37:19.877
trebuchets that you have repaired earlier that
have already torn down, or at least have suffered

00:37:19.877 --> 00:37:22.895
partial damage from fire or other elements,
bludgeoning.

00:37:22.895 --> 00:37:31.489
MARISHA: But there doesn't seem to be any tabards
from Emon, or any tabards from Syngorn or anything

00:37:31.489 --> 00:37:32.424
like that?

00:37:32.424 --> 00:37:38.433
MATT: No. It looks like when this began, currently
only Daxio's army was here. And is here

00:37:38.433 --> 00:37:39.491
currently.

00:37:39.491 --> 00:37:41.169
MARISHA: I mean, that still sucks. But okay.

00:37:41.169 --> 00:37:46.685
MATT: Yeah. You do watch and see as currently,
there is no tension toward you because the battles

00:37:46.685 --> 00:37:50.702
happening right now are still happening. You see
multiple soldiers gathering around wyverns that

00:37:50.702 --> 00:37:55.376
have been dragged to the ground with chain or have
nets thrown over them, and soldiers are gashing, running

00:37:55.376 --> 00:37:59.049
up and slashing and stabbing as they can, while the
lizardman carves its way through, and takes its

00:37:59.049 --> 00:38:03.511
spear and starts piercing out with its shield. As
you look around, nothing but insanity going

00:38:03.511 --> 00:38:05.449
around. What are you guys doing?

00:38:05.449 --> 00:38:11.043
LAURA: Are there any clusters that look like not a
lot of our soldiers around, just lizardmen? Or is

00:38:11.043 --> 00:38:12.651
it all mixed in together?

00:38:12.651 --> 00:38:16.467
MATT: It's all mixed in right now. It's a
free-for-all. There's no group of lizardmen

00:38:16.467 --> 00:38:18.094
sitting around and waiting out for a target.

00:38:18.094 --> 00:38:20.843
LAURA: Are there any wyverns in the sky that don't
see us?

00:38:20.843 --> 00:38:25.743
MATT: There are a number of wyverns scattered that
are currently swooping down and being part of the chaos.

00:38:25.743 --> 00:38:27.301
MARISHA: About how many wyverns?

00:38:27.301 --> 00:38:31.673
MATT: Currently not engaged on the ground? I'd say
about seven.

00:38:31.673 --> 00:38:38.143
TRAVIS: Can I go full murderhobo status and find a
group of people on the ground that need help?

00:38:38.143 --> 00:38:39.873
MATT: Yeah, totally.

00:38:39.873 --> 00:38:42.632
LAURA: I want to try to get a sneak attack on one
of the wyverns.

00:38:42.632 --> 00:38:44.963
MARISHA: I'm going to also go for the wyverns.

00:38:44.963 --> 00:38:48.238
TALIESIN: I'm going to activate my spider-climbing
boots and going to reload and I'm going to start

00:38:48.238 --> 00:38:56.715
walking around and pot-shotting anything on the
ground that's giving trouble. If I see somebody,

00:38:56.715 --> 00:38:58.579
I'm shooting until they stop.

00:38:58.579 --> 00:39:03.815
MATT: Okay. There are masses of lizardmen in this
area that are in the middle of the fray. As soon

00:39:03.815 --> 00:39:08.118
as you guys storm in and start making noise,
making your presence know, a number of them who

00:39:08.118 --> 00:39:12.222
are waiting for a way to pierce in and get their
weapons into the last of these soldiers that are

00:39:12.222 --> 00:39:16.486
fighting off, as best they can, the last
stand they have here at the outside of Fort Daxio,

00:39:16.486 --> 00:39:20.745
some of them turn over their shoulders and see you
and start rushing in. You guys, with ranged

00:39:20.745 --> 00:39:23.062
weapons, you go first. Go ahead and roll attacks
on this.

00:39:23.062 --> 00:39:26.074
LAURA: I get advantage because the wyverns
don't see me, right?

00:39:26.074 --> 00:39:28.169
MATT: The wyverns have not seen you.

00:39:28.169 --> 00:39:30.011
LAURA: Okay.

00:39:30.011 --> 00:39:33.771
MATT: Actually, make a stealth check, just to make
sure you've made your way in carefully. They're

00:39:33.771 --> 00:39:36.366
not paying attention to you, but they may or may
not see you out of their peripheral.

00:39:36.366 --> 00:39:38.006
LAURA: 19.

00:39:38.006 --> 00:39:40.078
MATT: Okay, yeah. The one you're aiming at has not
seen you.

00:39:40.078 --> 00:39:43.758
LAURA: Okay. 33.

00:39:43.758 --> 00:39:45.416
MATT: 33 hits.

00:39:45.416 --> 00:39:51.338
TALIESIN: I am going to cast on whatever the
biggest one is, and I'm going to cast Hex, which I

00:39:51.338 --> 00:39:59.154
still have. And I'm taking my first shot. 28.

00:39:59.154 --> 00:40:01.090
MATT: 28 hits.

00:40:01.090 --> 00:40:04.029
TALIESIN: Gun jam!

00:40:04.029 --> 00:40:05.965
TRAVIS: Damn it!

00:40:05.965 --> 00:40:11.540
LAURA: 31. 31 on the first hit.

00:40:11.540 --> 00:40:13.031
TALIESIN: I take five points of damage.

00:40:13.031 --> 00:40:14.409
MATT: Okay. What was that, the first one?

00:40:14.409 --> 00:40:15.311
LAURA: 31.

00:40:15.311 --> 00:40:16.625
MATT: 31, nice!

00:40:16.625 --> 00:40:18.538
LAURA: And the same, it's another 35 attack.

00:40:18.538 --> 00:40:19.857
MATT: That hits.

00:40:19.857 --> 00:40:29.056
TALIESIN: Before I went down, I do 15 points of
damage plus four points of psychic damage before

00:40:29.056 --> 00:40:30.717
the gun jammed.

00:40:30.717 --> 00:40:32.447
LAURA: 25 on the second.

00:40:32.447 --> 00:40:37.963
MATT: 25 damage? Great! So that one you're aiming
at had already taken some damage in the battle.

00:40:37.963 --> 00:40:42.467
Its rider had already been torn off of it and it's
basically on automatic tear-and-destroy mode. Both

00:40:42.467 --> 00:40:45.949
of your arrows-- one finds the side of its throat.
As it whips its head around to look at the

00:40:45.949 --> 00:40:50.646
direction it came with, this one finds the eye at
front of its snout, sinks in, and it slowly, limply

00:40:50.646 --> 00:40:54.271
falls out in the air and smashes into the ground,
maybe 25 feet to your right.

00:40:54.271 --> 00:40:58.280
TALIESIN: It also would have taken six points 
of necrotic damage to it, so.

00:40:58.280 --> 00:41:00.543
MATT: Okay, cool. You're aiming at the same one as
her?

00:41:00.543 --> 00:41:01.521
TALIESIN: Yeah.

00:41:01.521 --> 00:41:05.127
MATT: You guys (impact). This poor wyvern gets
torn asunder.

00:41:05.127 --> 00:41:06.517
TRAVIS: Poor, my ass!

00:41:06.517 --> 00:41:08.626
LAURA: Poor your ass!

00:41:08.626 --> 00:41:10.897
MATT: (laughs) Poor Travis' ass!

00:41:10.897 --> 00:41:14.391
SAM: Tall cup of Travis' ass.

00:41:14.391 --> 00:41:20.588
MATT: You watch as a number of these lizardmen,
six to be exact, all start rushing in towards you

00:41:20.588 --> 00:41:25.281
guys as they were firing at the wyvern in the air.
What are you guys doing at this point? You just

00:41:25.281 --> 00:41:27.338
have a wave of them coming at you right now.

00:41:27.338 --> 00:41:29.429
LIAM: I'm following Grog to get his scraps.

00:41:29.429 --> 00:41:31.454
MARISHA: They're coming at us?

00:41:31.454 --> 00:41:33.804
MATT: Yeah, you guys are still clustered
together.

00:41:33.804 --> 00:41:35.497
MARISHA: Is it a group of-- how many?

00:41:35.497 --> 00:41:39.364
MATT: Six. They're just charging straight at you.
Some have swords, shields, and spears like

00:41:39.364 --> 00:41:40.466
(snarling).

00:41:40.466 --> 00:41:44.141
MARISHA: Before anything crazy happens, I'm going
to go ahead and pull up the Spire of Conflux and

00:41:44.141 --> 00:41:47.220
I'm going to Fireball right where they are.

00:41:47.220 --> 00:41:55.626
MATT: As they're charging in, you watch the staff
slam into the ground. As it slams into the ground,

00:41:55.626 --> 00:42:00.659
you can see at the very tip, there's a small piece
of crystalline energy that begins to go from a

00:42:00.659 --> 00:42:06.582
dull greenish-blue to a bright red. And as it hits
the apex of its glow, a single beam of red energy

00:42:06.582 --> 00:42:12.041
streaks forward towards them as they're all
charging. What's the DC on that?

00:42:12.041 --> 00:42:15.012
MARISHA: 19.

00:42:15.012 --> 00:42:17.226
SAM: 19 on the Spire?!

00:42:17.226 --> 00:42:19.783
MATT: Well, it's whatever her spell DC is when she
cast it.

00:42:19.783 --> 00:42:21.081
SAM: Damn!

00:42:21.081 --> 00:42:29.216
MATT: And no, none of them make it! So go ahead and
roll the damage on that.

00:42:29.216 --> 00:42:32.006
MARISHA: Wait, Fireball. I don't know this
damage.

00:42:32.006 --> 00:42:34.069
SAM: 8d6. Radius 20.

00:42:34.069 --> 00:42:40.299
MARISHA: Give me two. I get to reroll ones, too,
because it's fire damage.

00:42:40.299 --> 00:42:41.968
MATT: Yep.

00:42:41.968 --> 00:42:46.108
MARISHA: And I got three ones. So those will all
get rerolled.

00:42:46.108 --> 00:42:47.442
SAM: Is that true?

00:42:47.442 --> 00:42:48.443
MARISHA: That is true.

00:42:48.443 --> 00:42:49.965
MATT: It's an ability of the Spire.

00:42:49.965 --> 00:42:52.217
TALIESIN: That's nuts.

00:42:52.217 --> 00:42:58.535
MARISHA: Ten, 15, 25 points.

00:42:58.535 --> 00:42:59.982
MATT: 25 points of damage?

00:42:59.982 --> 00:43:02.211
SAM: There's another six up there, the red one.

00:43:02.211 --> 00:43:08.694
MARISHA: One, two, three, four, five, six, seven,
eight! 25, 30 points of damage.

00:43:08.694 --> 00:43:09.956
MATT: 30 points of fire damage.

00:43:09.956 --> 00:43:11.068
MARISHA: Thanks, Sam!

00:43:11.068 --> 00:43:12.938
MATT; As you guys are getting your weapons ready,
you have both your daggers out at the side. You

00:43:12.938 --> 00:43:17.543
have your axe at the batter-up position. You watch
as suddenly they burst into red flame and a number

00:43:17.543 --> 00:43:21.378
of their charred, burning bodies tumble to the
ground, motionless. As the fire subsides, all six

00:43:21.378 --> 00:43:23.496
have been destroyed by the blast from the
Fireball.

00:43:23.496 --> 00:43:28.128
TRAVIS: That's what we were going to do, right?
Yeah! That's basically what we had in mind.

00:43:28.128 --> 00:43:30.532
LIAM: This knife does the same fucking thing.

00:43:30.532 --> 00:43:38.666
TRAVIS: I thought so. I've see it happen. Really,
I have. Impressive, Keyleth. Impressive. Yeah.

00:43:38.666 --> 00:43:42.616
Point it towards the enemies, okay?

00:43:42.616 --> 00:43:49.974
MATT: As the chaos is still happening, you watch
as another blast of flame explodes on the top

00:43:49.974 --> 00:43:55.626
tower that is the front of the fortress itself,
and you hear what sounds like dual Wilhelm screams

00:43:55.626 --> 00:44:01.631
as two guys who were situated on the top, running
to of the ballista, get blown off and both slam

00:44:01.631 --> 00:44:08.117
into the ground, faces and necks snapped from the
impact on the floor. Looking up in that direction,

00:44:08.117 --> 00:44:13.348
you watch as another streak of bluish-green arcane
energy shoots up a few hundred feet into the sky,

00:44:13.348 --> 00:44:16.980
and it (poof), as a sort of signal for them.

00:44:16.980 --> 00:44:18.545
MARISHA: No, no, no!

00:44:18.545 --> 00:44:25.847
MATT: You look up top as you see one wyvern is
curling its way, perched up on the edge of it. And

00:44:25.847 --> 00:44:35.440
there, jumping onto its back, you see an elf. An
elf with longish, blonde hair. Robes that are

00:44:35.440 --> 00:44:38.305
bloodied. It gets up and holds onto the reins.

00:44:38.305 --> 00:44:40.401
SAM: How far?

00:44:40.401 --> 00:44:45.140
MATT: At this point? He's probably about 80 feet
from you. You guys are halfway across the

00:44:45.140 --> 00:44:47.101
courtyard to the actual fortress.

00:44:47.101 --> 00:44:48.351
LIAM: He's up on the wall?

00:44:48.351 --> 00:44:49.953
SAM: Can I shoot him with lightning?

00:44:49.953 --> 00:44:51.844
MATT: If you want to get close.

00:44:51.844 --> 00:44:54.422
SAM: I mean, that's a 100-foot range.

00:44:54.422 --> 00:44:55.952
MATT: So, yes. You could.

00:44:55.952 --> 00:44:57.779
SAM: He's a bad guy?

00:44:57.779 --> 00:44:59.534
LAURA: I don't know!

00:44:59.534 --> 00:45:01.577
MARISHA: He's on a wyvern, so I'm going to say
maybe.

00:45:01.577 --> 00:45:03.199
LAURA: Can I shoot him with a Bramble Shot?

00:45:03.199 --> 00:45:04.466
MATT: About 45 feet up.

00:45:04.466 --> 00:45:05.866
LAURA: I want to try to shoot him with a Bramble
Shot.

00:45:05.866 --> 00:45:06.861
MATT: Shoot him?

00:45:06.861 --> 00:45:07.705
LAURA: Yeah!

00:45:07.705 --> 00:45:08.406
MATT: Okay!

00:45:08.406 --> 00:45:10.722
SAM: He's on a bad wyvern, right? This is a bad
guy.

00:45:10.722 --> 00:45:11.713
LAURA: I think so.

00:45:11.713 --> 00:45:15.380
MATT: For the purposes of this, guys, we're going
to go ahead and roll initiative.

00:45:15.380 --> 00:45:18.080
LAURA: He's a bad guy!

00:45:18.080 --> 00:45:20.942
MATT: Well, you don't know if he's a bad guy or
not! But he's on the battlefield.

00:45:20.942 --> 00:45:24.976
LAURA: That's why I'm Bramble Shotting him.
Because I'm trying to tangle him up.

00:45:24.976 --> 00:45:35.128
MATT: Pike has been having a hard time keeping up
with everyone with her tiny, short legs.

00:45:35.128 --> 00:45:36.526
LAURA: Pike!

00:45:36.526 --> 00:45:39.180
MARISHA: Come on, Pike! Come on!

00:45:39.180 --> 00:45:41.126
TALIESIN: I'm rolling really poorly.

00:45:41.126 --> 00:45:43.653
TRAVIS: Yeah, me too.

00:45:43.653 --> 00:45:45.646
LAURA: Do you have your snitch?

00:45:45.646 --> 00:45:47.342
TALIESIN: Yeah. It's just rolling poorly.

00:45:47.342 --> 00:45:48.681
LAURA: Do you want one of mine?

00:45:48.681 --> 00:45:49.750
TALIESIN: No, no.

00:45:49.750 --> 00:45:51.231
TRAVIS: Take your clothes off, Taliesin, reset.

00:45:51.231 --> 00:45:53.387
SAM: I'll take my clothes off. If it'll inspire
us.

00:45:53.387 --> 00:45:56.034
LAURA: Oh, no. What is it? Do it, Sam!

00:45:56.034 --> 00:45:58.400
TRAVIS: Do it slowly. Do it.

00:45:58.400 --> 00:46:03.084
(yelling)

00:46:03.084 --> 00:46:07.029
TRAVIS: Holy fuck!

00:46:07.029 --> 00:46:09.956
LIAM: Triple disadvantage for the night!

00:46:09.956 --> 00:46:12.363
TALIESIN: We're dead, we're going to die.

00:46:12.363 --> 00:46:13.897
SAM: It's on.

00:46:13.897 --> 00:46:17.232
(laughter)

00:46:17.232 --> 00:46:21.604
TRAVIS: For the rest of the game, you've got to
look at that--

00:46:21.653 --> 00:46:25.854
LIAM: May the odds be ever in your favor.

00:46:25.854 --> 00:46:28.060
(laughter)

00:46:28.060 --> 00:46:31.557
MATT: Forgot to mention the new GM Tips episode is
out this week, talking about how to deal with

00:46:31.557 --> 00:46:32.832
Player Character deaths.

00:46:32.832 --> 00:46:35.152
(laughter)

00:46:35.152 --> 00:46:37.584
SAM: Oh, man! If I died in this shirt, it would be
the worst way.

00:46:37.584 --> 00:46:39.663
(laughter)

00:46:39.663 --> 00:46:44.887
MATT: Oh my god! Sam! Sam!

00:46:44.887 --> 00:46:48.118
LIAM: We've never seen the picture at
that size. And it makes me want to Goonies-style

00:46:48.118 --> 00:46:50.245
cut a hole in the mouth.

00:46:50.245 --> 00:46:56.869
MATT: No one should ever say, "I want to cut a
hole in the mouth of a picture of you." I do want

00:46:56.869 --> 00:46:59.224
to say that is pretty much life-size, which is
really creepy.

00:46:59.224 --> 00:47:03.195
SAM: I wish I could do what Travis can do with his
pecs, but I--

00:47:03.195 --> 00:47:05.147
(laughter)

00:47:05.147 --> 00:47:06.490
TRAVIS: You're there, you're there.

00:47:06.490 --> 00:47:13.803
MATT: With you guys on the battlefield, let's roll
initiative.

00:47:13.803 --> 00:47:17.381
ALL: We did.

00:47:17.381 --> 00:47:18.884
TRAVIS: We have to do it again?

00:47:18.884 --> 00:47:20.936
TALIESIN: I'd love to do it again.

00:47:20.936 --> 00:47:22.280
MATT: (sing-song) Sorry!

00:47:22.280 --> 00:47:26.176
MARISHA: That was funny.

00:47:26.176 --> 00:47:28.297
MATT: You guys.

00:47:28.297 --> 00:47:40.440
SAM: He's a bad guy, right? I mean, we can kill
him, right?

00:47:40.440 --> 00:47:42.103
TRAVIS: Kill him anyway. And find out later.

00:47:42.103 --> 00:47:45.395
TALIESIN: We can also take out his ride.

00:47:45.395 --> 00:47:47.600
LAURA: Yeah, we can take out the wyvern.

00:47:47.600 --> 00:47:50.730
MATT: 25 to 20?

00:47:50.730 --> 00:47:51.889
LAURA: 25.

00:47:51.889 --> 00:47:53.142
LIAM: 22.

00:47:53.142 --> 00:47:58.760
MATT: Nice. 20 to 15?

00:47:58.760 --> 00:48:00.350
MARISHA: 15.

00:48:00.350 --> 00:48:03.679
MATT: I need someone to roll for Pike, by the
way.

00:48:03.679 --> 00:48:12.856
LAURA: Eight. I don't know what Pike's initiative
is.

00:48:12.856 --> 00:48:17.978
MATT: I think it's plus one, so add that-- Nine.
All right. So 15 to ten?

00:48:17.978 --> 00:48:19.659
TALIESIN: 13. Oh, go ahead.

00:48:19.659 --> 00:48:20.886
SAM: Oh, 11.

00:48:20.886 --> 00:48:25.055
TALIESIN: I don't have my sword working.

00:48:25.055 --> 00:48:27.342
MATT: Grog, what did you get?

00:48:27.342 --> 00:48:28.610
TRAVIS: Eight.

00:48:28.610 --> 00:48:33.461
LAURA: Aww, you and Pike fighting together.

00:48:33.461 --> 00:48:52.440
MATT: Top of the round, as you see this figure get
onto the wyvern up top. Bloodied, grabbing on

00:48:52.440 --> 00:48:55.048
to the reins, looking over the top, Vex, you're up
first.

00:48:55.048 --> 00:48:56.843
LAURA: I'm going to shoot a Bramble Shot at him.

00:48:56.843 --> 00:48:59.462
MATT: Okay.

00:48:59.462 --> 00:49:02.121
LAURA: 20?

00:49:02.121 --> 00:49:05.036
MATT: 20. Hits.

00:49:05.036 --> 00:49:11.042
TRAVIS: This man, this man is an elf, right?

00:49:11.042 --> 00:49:27.688
LAURA: 16. And then the DC is 16.

00:49:27.754 --> 00:49:33.652
MATT: 16 damage and DC of 16. Is it
strength?

00:49:33.727 --> 00:49:35.447
LAURA: Yeah.

00:49:35.447 --> 00:49:37.888
MATT: No, that's a 15.

00:49:37.888 --> 00:49:40.217
LAURA: Oh! Then he's restrained!

00:49:40.217 --> 00:49:42.170
MATT: Does he take additional damage from the
Bramble Shot?

00:49:42.170 --> 00:49:43.832
LAURA: Yeah, he takes 16 damage.

00:49:43.832 --> 00:49:46.900
MATT: 16 total from the shot, okay.

00:49:46.900 --> 00:49:49.653
LAURA: 16 damage from the shot, as far as I know.

00:49:49.653 --> 00:49:53.431
MATT: It's your normal arrow damage plus whatever
it tells you to roll on that.

00:49:53.431 --> 00:49:55.301
LAURA: I get another of my arrow damage?

00:49:55.301 --> 00:49:57.194
MATT: It's your arrow damage, and then that on top
of it.

00:49:57.194 --> 00:50:00.422
LAURA: What?! I didn't know that! That's so cool!

00:50:00.422 --> 00:50:08.320
LIAM: How far is he from us at this point?

00:50:08.320 --> 00:50:10.267
MATT: At this point, he's--

00:50:10.267 --> 00:50:12.303
LAURA: Is it sneak attack?

00:50:12.303 --> 00:50:14.700
MATT: He did not see you, so yes.

00:50:14.700 --> 00:50:19.858
SAM: What are you restraining?

00:50:19.858 --> 00:50:31.349
LAURA: The thing on top. Hopefully he doesn't have
a hold of the reins, so-- Now I've lost track. 28

00:50:31.349 --> 00:50:35.053
damage plus the 16 from the Bramble Shot.

00:50:35.053 --> 00:50:44.458
MATT: Gotcha. As you reach out and fire the arrow,
you watch him glance over the wall. His eyes go

00:50:44.458 --> 00:50:53.254
wide as the arrow (impact) pierces his chest and
sprouts into 20 to 25 tiny bramble-like vines that

00:50:53.254 --> 00:50:58.009
wrap around him and wrap around his body as he
gets pushed back and falls off the back of the

00:50:58.009 --> 00:51:01.952
wyvern, out of sight. Make a perception check.

00:51:01.952 --> 00:51:08.770
LAURA: Okay. 21?

00:51:08.770 --> 00:51:14.271
MATT: Okay. As you see his expression as he falls
back, it jogs your memory a little bit. You do

00:51:14.271 --> 00:51:19.977
recognize him. This is Gatekeeper Xanthas. He was
the gatekeeper at the Traverse Junction in the

00:51:19.977 --> 00:51:24.550
Emon Alabaster Lyceum, the place that had the
Teleportation Circles, the guy who was always at

00:51:24.550 --> 00:51:25.878
the desk waiting for you every time.

00:51:25.878 --> 00:51:28.002
LAURA: Oh, that guy! That was annoyed with us
every time we--

00:51:28.002 --> 00:51:29.238
MARISHA: He hated us?

00:51:29.238 --> 00:51:30.839
MATT: He was annoyed with you.

00:51:30.839 --> 00:51:32.324
MARISHA: He hated us. What's his name?

00:51:32.324 --> 00:51:38.600
MATT: Xanthas. Gatekeeper Xanthas. You watch him
just get thrown off the back of the wyvern,

00:51:38.600 --> 00:51:41.282
slammed past, out of sight.

00:51:41.282 --> 00:51:46.743
MARISHA: Hey, wonder why we hated him, we can't
remember his name, Seeker Xanthas.

00:51:46.743 --> 00:51:51.063
SAM: Huh, why is he here? Odd.

00:51:51.063 --> 00:51:52.618
LAURA: I don't know.

00:51:52.618 --> 00:51:56.281
MARISHA: Well, if he's from Emon, and Emon is
currently under Thordak's reign--

00:51:56.281 --> 00:51:58.291
LAURA: Yeah, he's probably working for him.

00:51:58.291 --> 00:52:02.222
TRAVIS: I think we should trust him.

00:52:02.222 --> 00:52:05.440
LAURA: We should definitely trust him.

00:52:05.440 --> 00:52:09.810
TALIESIN: He's currently a veggie burrito at the
moment, let's keep him that way.

00:52:09.810 --> 00:52:12.867
LAURA: Should I fly towards him?

00:52:12.916 --> 00:52:16.646
TALIESIN: I dunno. Why are you asking--?

00:52:16.646 --> 00:52:19.594
LAURA: I'm going to fly. I'm going to try get
towards him.

00:52:19.594 --> 00:52:21.575
TALIESIN: I'm having my own problem.

00:52:21.575 --> 00:52:32.100
MATT: So, at full speed on your broom, broom speed
is what again? It should be on the broom.

00:52:32.100 --> 00:52:41.922
LAURA: I don't have a broom paper. I never got a
broom paper because I kind of stole it. It wasn't

00:52:41.922 --> 00:52:43.098
given to me.

00:52:43.098 --> 00:52:46.192
MATT: I'm sure it does have one. I'll look it up
right now, but you need to keep in mind what

00:52:46.192 --> 00:52:47.483
your movement is on your broom.

00:52:47.483 --> 00:52:49.327
LAURA: I think it's like 120.

00:52:49.327 --> 00:52:53.060
MARISHA: It's, like, exactly what I need to get
there.

00:52:53.060 --> 00:52:57.627
How far away is he? It's that much.

00:52:57.627 --> 00:52:58.965
MATT: It's like, ten

00:52:58.965 --> 00:53:00.958
TRAVIS: It's 40. I'm saying it's 40.

00:53:00.958 --> 00:53:02.507
LAURA: No. It's, I'd say, 50.

00:53:02.507 --> 00:53:04.435
MATT: Flying speed: 50 feet.

00:53:04.435 --> 00:53:06.472
TRAVIS: Don't raise your hand like you got it
right.

00:53:06.472 --> 00:53:08.899
LAURA: I did! I said 50, right before he said it.

00:53:08.899 --> 00:53:11.666
SAM: Yes, you also said ten, 120, 180 and 50.

00:53:11.666 --> 00:53:20.778
TRAVIS: It's playing Rock-Paper-Scissors and
going-- Got it!

00:53:20.778 --> 00:53:31.348
MATT: As you rush in on the broom and look over,
the wyvern still has its claws up on the edge of

00:53:31.348 --> 00:53:36.898
the walls, (snarls), looking around. You can see
it's taken a few hits, a few arrows sticking out

00:53:36.898 --> 00:53:44.270
of it. However, from the explosion that happened,
the two ballistae up there don't appear to be

00:53:44.270 --> 00:53:49.491
damaged. But you have no current view of Xanthas.

00:53:49.491 --> 00:53:50.855
LAURA: Okay.

00:53:50.855 --> 00:53:53.394
MATT: So, that ending your turn, that brings us to
Vax.

00:53:53.394 --> 00:53:59.132
LIAM: Jeez. How far away is that little rock right
at the bottom of that platform that you've got Vex

00:53:59.132 --> 00:54:00.771
on? How far is that from me?

00:54:00.771 --> 00:54:05.654
MATT: That rock? It's about maybe 40 feet?

00:54:05.654 --> 00:54:07.591
LIAM: And how high is the wall?

00:54:07.591 --> 00:54:10.520
MATT: Up here? Probably about 30 feet tall.

00:54:10.520 --> 00:54:16.347
LIAM: Okay. Do I see any wood or anything, a
barrel or anything besides stone sticking out?

00:54:16.347 --> 00:54:21.989
MATT: No. Not in that rock, no. It's a piece of
stone that's sticking out.

00:54:21.989 --> 00:54:26.663
LIAM: I am going to hold everything until the rest
of the party goes this round.

00:54:26.663 --> 00:54:29.048
MATT: Okay. Keyleth?

00:54:29.048 --> 00:54:32.628
MARISHA: Okay. Is there anyone else coming at us?

00:54:32.628 --> 00:54:41.756
MATT: Currently, no.There are a number of the
wyvern riders and-- going to place these guys over

00:54:41.756 --> 00:54:46.445
here so I go and do that-- You do see lizardmen
off to the side that are in the middle of a

00:54:46.445 --> 00:55:00.452
struggle. A soldier over there, and a number of
lizardmen that are currently bashing at the front

00:55:00.452 --> 00:55:03.418
gates, trying to get through the main door into
the--

00:55:03.418 --> 00:55:10.517
MARISHA: Okay. Where did you say where the wyvern
riders were, again? Roughly, in the air?

00:55:10.517 --> 00:55:17.477
MATT: You have three that are on the ground right
now that have nets thrown over them or chains

00:55:17.477 --> 00:55:21.187
pulled across, holding them down. And there are a
number that are high up in the air right

00:55:21.187 --> 00:55:25.876
now, circling, looking for a way to swoop down and
grab somebody. A few have their eyes on Vex.

00:55:25.876 --> 00:55:28.539
MARISHA: Are they clustering together?

00:55:28.539 --> 00:55:31.232
MATT: They're maybe 40 feet apart right now.

00:55:31.232 --> 00:55:35.994
MARISHA: Oh, yeah? They're each 40
feet?

00:55:35.994 --> 00:55:37.302
MATT: At the least.

00:55:37.302 --> 00:55:42.345
MARISHA: Fuck. Okay, you know what? And how far
away am I from them?

00:55:42.345 --> 00:55:46.677
MATT: From the closest one to you? About 80 feet.

00:55:46.677 --> 00:55:48.441
MARISHA: Jesus.

00:55:48.441 --> 00:55:51.674
TALIESIN: We have to start moving in a direction.

00:55:51.674 --> 00:55:54.090
TRAVIS: Towards the door, right? And then try to
get the--

00:55:54.090 --> 00:56:01.932
MARISHA: I was going to try and get these guys
out, but okay. How many are busting through the

00:56:01.932 --> 00:56:03.551
door? How many lizardmen?

00:56:03.551 --> 00:56:07.658
MATT: There are currently six pushed against it.
And there are a few that are moving off in this

00:56:07.658 --> 00:56:10.030
direction to go join them.

00:56:10.030 --> 00:56:11.621
MARISHA: To bust through. Those are bad guys?

00:56:11.621 --> 00:56:15.020
MATT: Yeah. They're currently slamming into the
door and hitting it and trying to find their way through.

00:56:15.020 --> 00:56:18.119
MARISHA: Well, let's Fireball them again. That was
fun!

00:56:18.119 --> 00:56:19.424
MATT: Okay!

00:56:19.424 --> 00:56:21.613
TRAVIS: Will it set the gate on fire?

00:56:21.613 --> 00:56:23.710
TALIESIN: Not if you place it right.

00:56:23.710 --> 00:56:28.008
MATT: From what you can tell and what you remember,
the gate itself is mostly stone and iron.

00:56:28.008 --> 00:56:30.433
MARISHA: So let's blow that shit up.

00:56:30.433 --> 00:56:45.158
MATT: All right. So keep track of the charges
you're using. They all fail.

00:56:45.158 --> 00:56:47.503
MARISHA: I can see both of them.

00:56:47.503 --> 00:56:51.500
TRAVIS: They all fail?

00:56:51.500 --> 00:56:54.421
MATT: Yeah, they all fail. Rolling nothing tonight.

00:56:54.421 --> 00:57:04.446
MARISHA: Oh, I have another eight. All of them?
All six of them? I'm drunk with power. It's 6d8?

00:57:04.446 --> 00:57:05.647
SAM: No, 8d6.

00:57:05.647 --> 00:57:09.253
MARISHA: 8d6! (counts)

00:57:09.253 --> 00:57:10.639
TALIESIN: Reroll.

00:57:10.639 --> 00:57:12.166
MARISHA: Yeah, I get to reroll ones.

00:57:12.166 --> 00:57:13.647
SAM: Cocked.

00:57:13.647 --> 00:57:19.497
MARISHA: That's also cocked. That one bumped it
from what it was--

00:57:19.497 --> 00:57:20.674
SAM: It was a four.

00:57:20.674 --> 00:57:34.399
MARISHA: It was a four, okay. So six, ten, 18, 20,
five, 30 again. No, 31!

00:57:34.399 --> 00:57:42.541
MATT: 31. (explosion) This one seed of arcane red
energy that shoots forth from the staff slams into

00:57:42.541 --> 00:57:46.083
the door, and you watch as they're all thrown
backwards, screaming through the air, the blast

00:57:46.083 --> 00:57:49.012
incinerating their bodies and scattering them to
the four winds.

00:57:49.012 --> 00:57:50.690
LAURA: Fucking shit, Keyleth!

00:57:50.690 --> 00:57:52.943
LIAM: Fire walk with me, Red.

00:57:52.943 --> 00:57:56.401
MARISHA: I feel like this thing should come with a
child warning. Oh, jeez.

00:57:56.401 --> 00:57:59.701
TRAVIS: Wait, that smoked all of them?

00:57:59.701 --> 00:58:04.276
MATT: All of those there, yeah. You see groups of
wyvern riders that are currently fighting off the

00:58:04.276 --> 00:58:07.555
guards. Keyleth, do you want to move or are you
staying there?

00:58:07.555 --> 00:58:11.401
MARISHA: We were all running towards the door,
right? We're all trying to get in?

00:58:11.401 --> 00:58:12.541
MATT: That's up to you.

00:58:12.541 --> 00:58:13.822
MARISHA: We're all trying to get in?

00:58:13.822 --> 00:58:15.066
TALIESIN: I'm heading that way.

00:58:15.066 --> 00:58:16.222
MARISHA: I start heading that way.

00:58:16.222 --> 00:58:17.522
MATT: All right.

00:58:17.522 --> 00:58:19.737
MARISHA: Why'd you say it so nonchalant?

00:58:19.737 --> 00:58:21.273
LAURA: Oh no, oh no!

00:58:21.273 --> 00:58:23.013
MARISHA: It's always like it's a bad idea.

00:58:23.013 --> 00:58:26.067
MATT: I'm asking if you'd-- Vax stayed there. Up
to you.

00:58:26.067 --> 00:58:27.636
MARISHA: Well, he held his turn.

00:58:27.636 --> 00:58:30.645
LIAM: Yep. I can't do anything now. I have to wait
until everyone's done.

00:58:30.645 --> 00:58:34.799
MATT: Yeah. You are staying here. All right, ends
Keyleth's turn, Percival, what are you doing?

00:58:34.799 --> 00:58:37.409
TALIESIN: I'm going to use my action to try and
clear my gun.

00:58:37.409 --> 00:58:40.323
MATT: Okay. Tinkering check.

00:58:40.323 --> 00:58:50.690
TALIESIN: Tinkering check, so that's nice. It's
18! It's fine!

00:58:50.690 --> 00:58:53.056
MATT: All right. You get the gun to function.

00:58:53.056 --> 00:58:58.244
TALIESIN: I take six steps forward.

00:58:58.244 --> 00:59:01.050
SAM: (sings) I take six steps back.

00:59:01.050 --> 00:59:02.659
TALIESIN: And then I use my bonus action...

00:59:02.659 --> 00:59:04.220
LIAM, LAURA and SAM: (singing) We go together
because--

00:59:04.220 --> 00:59:06.567
ALL: (singing) --opposites attract! And you
know--

00:59:06.567 --> 00:59:07.806
MATT: It's not your turn, Scanlan.

00:59:07.806 --> 00:59:09.135
SAM: Oh, sorry.

00:59:09.135 --> 00:59:11.077
(laughter)

00:59:11.077 --> 00:59:17.790
TALIESIN: I'm going to use my bonus action to move
my Hex to one of the wyverns that is currently

00:59:17.790 --> 00:59:18.967
under the net.

00:59:18.967 --> 00:59:20.574
MATT: Right here? The wyvern or the rider?

00:59:20.574 --> 00:59:24.271
TALIESIN: The wyvern. Yeah. It's fighting
everybody too, right?

00:59:24.271 --> 00:59:25.958
MATT: Correct. It's thrashing about.

00:59:25.958 --> 00:59:28.066
TALIESIN: Okay, it's going to make life easier for
everybody.

00:59:28.066 --> 00:59:31.421
MATT: Cool. So that finishes your round then,
Percy. Scanlan, now it's your turn.

00:59:31.421 --> 00:59:41.022
SAM: Oh! I'll move forward with the rest of the
gang, if I can. I don't know. I'll Lightning Bolt

00:59:41.022 --> 00:59:49.751
the wyvern up there who was holding the elf. Not
knowing what he is or if he's good or bad.

00:59:49.751 --> 00:59:55.495
MATT: You're rushing forward on your tiny, gnome
feet, arm out in front, release a bolt of energy

00:59:55.495 --> 01:00:01.856
that slams into the front of the edge of the tower
itself. And as you coast it upward, it burns a

01:00:01.856 --> 01:00:07.998
dark spot across the stonework before slamming
into the wyvern itself. The wyvern tries to dodge

01:00:07.998 --> 01:00:10.428
out of the way. What is the DC on that?

01:00:10.428 --> 01:00:14.146
SAM: That would be 19, since I didn't call it.

01:00:14.146 --> 01:00:15.604
MATT: That's true.

01:00:15.604 --> 01:00:17.383
TRAVIS: (sings) That's true.

01:00:17.383 --> 01:00:20.205
MATT: (sings) That's true. (speaking) No, it
does not succeed!

01:00:20.205 --> 01:00:22.735
SAM: Okay.

01:00:22.735 --> 01:00:25.713
MATT: It has no dex bonus, so it's a straight 15.

01:00:25.713 --> 01:00:38.250
SAM: 8d6? Wow! 37!

01:00:38.250 --> 01:00:47.336
MATT: (explosion) It hits the wyvern, who's
already taken a few blows. It shrieks back, looks

01:00:47.336 --> 01:00:54.050
down, its eyes zeroed in on you, its wings out,
looks like it's about to go into a jumping dive.

01:00:54.050 --> 01:00:56.789
Okay.

01:00:56.789 --> 01:01:02.720
SAM: Oh, I will also inspire Vax with a
dirty limerick.

01:01:02.720 --> 01:01:04.304
LIAM: Give it to me.

01:01:04.304 --> 01:01:05.900
SAM: So, this is a random--

01:01:05.900 --> 01:01:12.100
There was a young lady named Spruce/ whose
favorite thrill was a goose/ Just the sight of a

01:01:12.100 --> 01:01:18.067
thumb/ made her tuchus all numb/ and her bowels
got excited and loose.

01:01:18.067 --> 01:01:20.545
TRAVIS: Oh god! (groans in disgust)

01:01:20.545 --> 01:01:21.620
TALIESIN: Why? Why?!

01:01:21.620 --> 01:01:23.669
TRAVIS: Where did you? Where?! What?!

01:01:23.669 --> 01:01:25.346
LIAM: I feel so brave.

01:01:25.346 --> 01:01:27.812
(laughter)

01:01:27.812 --> 01:01:34.144
SAM: Let that story inspire you, Vax! Don't be
loose like her bowels! Be firm like a mighty oak!

01:01:34.144 --> 01:01:35.763
(laughter)

01:01:35.763 --> 01:01:37.921
LIAM: I stand a full inch taller now.

01:01:37.921 --> 01:01:39.659
MATT: You do. And take your d12 inspiration die.

01:01:39.659 --> 01:01:46.081
TALIESIN: This is not what this book was meant
for!

01:01:46.081 --> 01:01:48.395
LIAM: It's from the frogurt shop.

01:01:48.395 --> 01:01:51.556
(laughter)

01:01:51.556 --> 01:01:55.201
MARISHA: His ability to weaponize things--

01:01:55.201 --> 01:01:57.500
TALIESIN: I'm going to get a volume for next
Christmas.

01:01:57.500 --> 01:02:12.807
MATT: All righty. And with that, ending your turn,
the wyvern up at the top swoops down, right up to

01:02:12.807 --> 01:02:16.615
you, Scanlan. Mouth open, stinger out to the
side.

01:02:16.615 --> 01:02:18.771
SAM: I'll Cutting Words this one.

01:02:18.771 --> 01:02:25.509
MATT: Okay. Well, its bite goes to strike you and
I can almost guarantee you it misses with a 14.

01:02:25.509 --> 01:02:29.632
The stinger, however (whoosh).

01:02:29.632 --> 01:02:31.475
SAM: Oh wait! No, no. That hits.

01:02:31.475 --> 01:02:34.824
TALIESIN: You have a plus two.

01:02:34.824 --> 01:02:40.658
SAM: No, I think I only have a plus two if I-- No,
I think it's a straight 14 because I don't wear

01:02:40.658 --> 01:02:42.189
anything anymore.

01:02:42.189 --> 01:02:43.760
MATT: That's true, you didn't-- All right, so.

01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:45.153
LAURA: You took off &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; your armor?

01:02:45.153 --> 01:02:46.235
SAM: Yeah.

01:02:46.235 --> 01:02:48.446
LAURA: If you have the armor on, it doesn't have
to be attuned, you still get some--

01:02:48.446 --> 01:02:52.242
SAM: I think I'm at 12, plus the armor that I'm
wearing is plus two, so.

01:02:52.242 --> 01:02:54.327
MATT: So it's 14. That does hit you exactly,
yeah.

01:02:54.327 --> 01:02:57.572
SAM: But I said I was going to Cutting Words it,
which probably should help.

01:02:57.572 --> 01:02:59.504
MATT: Go for it. So go ahead and--

01:02:59.504 --> 01:03:02.092
SAM: Eight.

01:03:02.092 --> 01:03:06.103
MATT: Eight. Okay. The bite goes to clamp down,
and as you--

01:03:06.103 --> 01:03:16.180
SAM: Oh! As I look at him, I-- shit! I-- Ah! I
just show him my chest hair. I tuft it out into a

01:03:16.180 --> 01:03:18.717
quick little ponytail.

01:03:18.717 --> 01:03:24.759
MATT: The wyvern pulls back its head, confused,
and the jaw snaps shut as it rears, its wings out,

01:03:24.759 --> 01:03:32.005
strangely. Its tail comes back, angrily. How
many bardic inspiration die have you spent since

01:03:32.005 --> 01:03:33.452
your last battle, by the way?

01:03:33.452 --> 01:03:39.627
SAM: I only spent one on the last battle. I did a
bunch of reactions last battle, but I only used

01:03:39.627 --> 01:03:41.929
one inspiration last battle.

01:03:41.929 --> 01:03:44.123
MATT: Right. Cutting Words also uses a bardic
inspiration, I believe--

01:03:44.123 --> 01:03:45.601
SAM: Oh, it does? Then this is five.

01:03:45.601 --> 01:03:47.448
MATT: I believe... Let me check.

01:03:47.448 --> 01:03:51.907
SAM: I used three Cutting Words last time, and one
inspiration.

01:03:51.907 --> 01:03:59.503
MATT: Yeah, you have to use your bardic
inspiration dice. So that's five.

01:03:59.503 --> 01:04:03.517
SAM: So this is five. And I think I have six
total? No?

01:04:03.517 --> 01:04:06.976
MATT: You get as many as your wisdom modifier--
I'm sorry, your charisma modifier.

01:04:06.976 --> 01:04:10.545
SAM: That's six. So yeah, I have one more.

01:04:10.545 --> 01:04:21.292
MATT: One more. So the stinger comes swooping down
towards you, and that is a nine! It rolled a two.

01:04:21.292 --> 01:04:24.754
The tail whips past your head, no impact.

01:04:24.754 --> 01:04:27.705
LAURA: You're just so teeny, Scanlan.

01:04:27.705 --> 01:04:29.270
SAM: I am.

01:04:29.270 --> 01:04:40.107
MATT: Pike's turn! Pike rushing forward as
(panting). Looking around, who here looks pretty

01:04:40.107 --> 01:04:41.550
rough, if anybody?

01:04:41.550 --> 01:04:42.550
LAURA: Percy.

01:04:42.550 --> 01:04:44.434
TALIESIN: I'm a little rough, I could use some
love.

01:04:44.434 --> 01:04:46.024
MARISHA: And I could use some love.

01:04:46.024 --> 01:04:48.571
TALIESIN: Yeah, either of us. I'm a little lower
than you. But you're--

01:04:48.571 --> 01:04:50.923
MARISHA: I'm running with Percy.

01:04:50.923 --> 01:04:52.912
TALIESIN: Yeah. We're together.

01:04:52.912 --> 01:04:54.520
MARISHA: If she wants to give us a group hug?

01:04:54.520 --> 01:04:57.146
MATT: Well, she can only get up to you right now,
Keyleth, at the moment.

01:04:57.146 --> 01:04:58.264
MARISHA: Oh.

01:04:58.264 --> 01:04:59.636
MATT: Because of her stumpy legs.

01:04:59.636 --> 01:05:00.726
MARISHA: Sorry.

01:05:00.726 --> 01:05:01.711
TALIESIN: Stumpy legs.

01:05:01.711 --> 01:05:04.140
LAURA: They're slender and fabulous! All right?

01:05:04.140 --> 01:05:05.771
SAM: Yeah. They're muscular. Svelte.

01:05:05.771 --> 01:05:07.098
LIAM: Monster calves.

01:05:07.098 --> 01:05:08.377
MATT: Fucking stumpy!

01:05:08.377 --> 01:05:10.976
(laughter)

01:05:10.976 --> 01:05:15.708
MATT: She's going to use her 3rd-level Cure Wounds
on you, Keyleth.

01:05:15.708 --> 01:05:17.220
MARISHA: Aw, thanks, Pike!

01:05:17.220 --> 01:05:25.924
MATT: Two eights and a five. This is 16, 21, plus
five. You heal 26 hit points. That was a really

01:05:25.924 --> 01:05:34.171
good healing roll for a level three. All righty.
That ends Pike's turn. Grog, you're up.

01:05:34.171 --> 01:05:40.309
TRAVIS: Yeah! So, I'll run up, because &lt;i&gt;nobody&lt;/i&gt;
fucks with Scanlan when I'm around. So I run up to

01:05:40.309 --> 01:05:48.299
the wyvern. Yeah. And I would like to take my axe
and swing it in its stupid face.

01:05:48.299 --> 01:05:49.673
MATT: Go for it.

01:05:49.673 --> 01:05:53.469
TRAVIS: Reckless Attack. Great Weapon Master.

01:05:53.469 --> 01:05:55.603
SAM: Frenzy. Rage.

01:05:55.603 --> 01:05:58.112
LAURA: All of it. (growling) All of it!

01:05:58.112 --> 01:05:59.741
MATT: He's not frenzied yet.

01:05:59.741 --> 01:06:02.343
TRAVIS: 28 minus five is 23.

01:06:02.343 --> 01:06:03.451
MATT: That hits.

01:06:03.451 --> 01:06:04.880
TRAVIS: Okay.

01:06:04.880 --> 01:06:06.993
LAURA: How'd you do that, Grog?!

01:06:06.993 --> 01:06:08.187
TRAVIS: Shhh!

01:06:08.187 --> 01:06:09.670
SAM: Doing the math?

01:06:09.670 --> 01:06:12.723
TRAVIS: 25 plus ten is 35.

01:06:12.723 --> 01:06:20.624
MATT: Okay. Second strike, you want to do it? As
you rush and slam the axe into its side, it buries

01:06:20.624 --> 01:06:25.370
a good three inches into the chest, and as it's
pulled back, its tail is still recoiling from the

01:06:25.370 --> 01:06:31.399
attack on Scanlan. Looks back to you and you see
its attention's geared on you, but it's pretty rough.

01:06:31.399 --> 01:06:34.781
TRAVIS: Pretty rough? Yeah! I just want to finish
off this little meat popsicle.

01:06:34.781 --> 01:06:36.125
MATT: Okay, go for it.

01:06:36.125 --> 01:06:37.251
TRAVIS: Same thing.

01:06:37.251 --> 01:06:38.284
MATT: Okay.

01:06:38.284 --> 01:06:47.337
TRAVIS: 19 plus a million. 33. No! Minus five.
28.

01:06:47.337 --> 01:06:52.892
MATT: 28. As you pull the axe out this time, as
it's rearing back and looking angrily at you, you

01:06:52.892 --> 01:06:58.019
chuckle to yourself as you throw the axe up in the
air. It spins once and you catch it, and you jam

01:06:58.019 --> 01:07:02.431
it right in the center of its skull. It goes from
rearing angrily to lights out. And it hits the

01:07:02.431 --> 01:07:06.134
ground instantaneously, collapsing into a heap as
you wedge the blade out from the center of its

01:07:06.134 --> 01:07:07.305
forehead.

01:07:07.305 --> 01:07:12.702
TRAVIS: Amazing. Can I use my--

01:07:12.702 --> 01:07:16.371
MATT: You still have about 20 feet of movement, by
the way.

01:07:16.371 --> 01:07:21.896
TRAVIS: Can I-- Yeah. I'll move towards the group
on the left.

01:07:21.896 --> 01:07:23.002
MATT: That side?

01:07:23.002 --> 01:07:23.850
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:07:23.850 --> 01:07:26.089
LAURA: Don't you get an attack again if you killed
something?

01:07:26.089 --> 01:07:31.980
TRAVIS: Oh! Oh! Yes! Thank you! Very good point!
With my bloodaxe, if I kill a creature, I gain ten

01:07:31.980 --> 01:07:33.731
temporary hit points.

01:07:33.731 --> 01:07:36.378
MATT: Yeah. So you now have ten temporary hit
points on top of what you had.

01:07:36.378 --> 01:07:40.575
TRAVIS: Beautiful. And I don't think I get another
hit. It's only criticals that I--

01:07:40.575 --> 01:07:42.419
LAURA: Oh! Okay. Well, still.

01:07:42.419 --> 01:07:43.723
TRAVIS: But still, yeah, yeah.

01:07:43.723 --> 01:07:46.720
MATT: All right. So that ends your turn, Grog?

01:07:46.720 --> 01:07:47.882
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:07:47.882 --> 01:07:49.352
MATT: That's the end of the round.

01:07:49.352 --> 01:07:51.649
LIAM: Do I have a go? Do I get to go?

01:07:51.649 --> 01:07:53.505
MATT: That's right. You held to wait until
everybody else has a go.

01:07:53.505 --> 01:07:55.933
LIAM: Question: can I call out, Vex! Catch!

01:07:55.933 --> 01:07:56.939
LAURA: Huh?

01:07:56.939 --> 01:08:00.089
LIAM: And softball-pitch Whisper up to her?

01:08:00.089 --> 01:08:05.211
MATT: Okay. So you-- go ahead and roll an attack
roll.

01:08:05.211 --> 01:08:07.631
LAURA: It just stabs me.

01:08:07.631 --> 01:08:08.931
LIAM: Sure. 26.

01:08:08.931 --> 01:08:15.661
MATT: 26. Okay. As the dagger whips up past you,
you look down and see the thrown dagger. Do you

01:08:15.661 --> 01:08:17.412
want to try and catch it?

01:08:17.412 --> 01:08:18.714
LAURA: Sure.

01:08:18.714 --> 01:08:21.017
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and make a dexterity check.

01:08:21.017 --> 01:08:22.175
LAURA: Okay.

01:08:22.175 --> 01:08:23.500
LIAM: This should be pretty good.

01:08:23.500 --> 01:08:26.919
LAURA: Where's my thing?

01:08:26.919 --> 01:08:31.256
LIAM: This does involve me. Can I use my Luck for
her to re-roll that?

01:08:31.256 --> 01:08:32.259
LAURA: 21.

01:08:32.259 --> 01:08:39.403
MATT: No, unfortunately. You reach out and catch
the blade and it cuts across your hand a little

01:08:39.403 --> 01:08:43.305
bit. Which at that point, if you want to--

01:08:43.305 --> 01:08:44.635
LIAM: Bamf!

01:08:44.635 --> 01:08:49.084
MATT: As your turn to travel with it, it's the
damage that needs to happen, it's the impact. So

01:08:49.084 --> 01:08:58.246
you do take four points of piercing damage, as you
try and catch it from the front of the blade in

01:08:58.246 --> 01:09:02.483
your hand, and the speed at which it's thrown is--
you feel the impact--

01:09:02.483 --> 01:09:04.419
LAURA: And then I brace the broom to catch him--

01:09:04.419 --> 01:09:08.532
MATT: At which point, the blade, all of a sudden,
swirls with dark, shadow energy and your brother

01:09:08.532 --> 01:09:09.851
appears at your side.

01:09:09.851 --> 01:09:12.864
LIAM: And I would like to use my bonus action to
cast Lay on Hands and give her four hit points.

01:09:12.864 --> 01:09:16.796
LAURA: Aww, buddy! (laughs) That's so great.

01:09:16.796 --> 01:09:19.676
LIAM: That's it, just four. I get to choose how
many

01:09:19.676 --> 01:09:23.612
LAURA: Thanks! I catch him on the broom and hand
him the--

01:09:23.612 --> 01:09:27.974
LIAM: And I'll use my movement to scooch my
uncomfortable crotch onto this stick you ride all

01:09:27.974 --> 01:09:30.117
over the place. (groans)

01:09:30.117 --> 01:09:33.208
MATT: All righty. Your movement is now, on the
broom, reduced to 20 feet, with two people on it.

01:09:33.208 --> 01:09:34.725
LIAM: Cool.

01:09:34.725 --> 01:09:36.151
LAURA: What are you going to do?

01:09:36.151 --> 01:09:42.645
MATT: At which point, you see the wyverns and the
riders start thrashing about. Some of them have

01:09:42.645 --> 01:09:47.407
spears that're jamming out from the middle of the
net. You watch as this guy spins around and takes

01:09:47.407 --> 01:09:51.909
out three out of the guards that all just collapse
to the ground. One takes a stinger to the face,

01:09:51.909 --> 01:09:56.599
another one gets bitten and has its head broken in
the process, while a third one gets a spear to the

01:09:56.599 --> 01:09:58.271
front of the chest.

01:09:58.271 --> 01:09:59.636
MARISHA: This wyvern asshole did that?

01:09:59.636 --> 01:10:03.255
MATT: Over here, yeah. He's hurt, but he's been
taking out a lot of the guards along the way. The

01:10:03.255 --> 01:10:10.852
rest of these lizard guards do a full double dash
this way past that guard there, who's giving

01:10:10.852 --> 01:10:18.525
chase. These guys all rush up to try and make
their way to the front door again. They can't

01:10:18.525 --> 01:10:24.941
really do anything yet to the door, but they can
get there. At this point in time--

01:10:24.941 --> 01:10:26.291
SAM: Oh boy.

01:10:26.291 --> 01:10:30.490
MATT: Vex, Vax.

01:10:30.490 --> 01:10:31.403
LAURA: Yeah.

01:10:31.403 --> 01:10:39.072
MATT: From your vantage point, up at the top on
the broom, you hear this distant echoing horn

01:10:39.072 --> 01:10:42.202
sound, this (low horn noise).

01:10:42.202 --> 01:10:43.797
LAURA: Shit.

01:10:43.797 --> 01:10:48.770
MATT: It's echoing through the valley. You glance
over your shoulder and you see a bead of burning

01:10:48.770 --> 01:11:00.798
red light making its way in your direction. Wings
flapping. It's closer than you think, and as it

01:11:00.798 --> 01:11:03.193
comes closer and closer towards you--

01:11:03.193 --> 01:11:07.218
LAURA: Thordak comes and kills us all, right?!

01:11:07.218 --> 01:11:09.940
MARISHA: Yeah, this is-- Happy 2016!

01:11:09.940 --> 01:11:17.637
MATT: You feel the blood rush from your face as
your immediate instinct is, "Oh god. The Cinder

01:11:17.637 --> 01:11:23.925
"King is here." While there are flames involved,
the size is not as immense as you would expect

01:11:23.925 --> 01:11:31.967
from Thordak. Instead what you see is a large,
red, winged bird with flames trailing off the

01:11:31.967 --> 01:11:38.333
edges of its wings flapping in your direction,
coming over the wall on the outside of the

01:11:38.333 --> 01:11:47.817
fortress. On its back you see a humanoid, but much
larger than anyone of your size, armored with dark

01:11:47.817 --> 01:11:55.733
black and grayish-silver-trimmed iron armor, a
giant maul in one hand, itself reddish flame-like

01:11:55.733 --> 01:12:00.454
hair. This is a fire giant, similar to the ones
you encountered in the City of Brass, riding on

01:12:00.454 --> 01:12:06.697
the back of this ember-roc-type creature. As it
comes cruising over the top, you hear it, holding

01:12:06.697 --> 01:12:15.482
a horn in its other hand, start shouting out, "The
Cinder King calls for swift execution! I deliver

01:12:15.482 --> 01:12:26.146
"his hate with absolute strength." And it swoops
into a dive toward the front side of the gate. At

01:12:26.146 --> 01:12:30.730
a full speed at this point, it coasts right
beneath both of you, swinging the hammer in the

01:12:30.730 --> 01:12:33.528
air. I need both of you guys to make dexterity
saving throws.

01:12:33.528 --> 01:12:36.042
LIAM: Would evasion work for this?

01:12:36.042 --> 01:12:40.726
MATT: No. Well, evasion is against any spell.

01:12:40.726 --> 01:12:42.830
LIAM: Spell, that's what I thought, I just wanted
to check.

01:12:42.830 --> 01:12:44.754
LAURA: Do we get advantage for anything?

01:12:44.754 --> 01:12:47.727
MATT: Let me check quick. (laughs) You do not get
advantage for anything.

01:12:47.727 --> 01:12:50.626
LAURA: (laughs) Why, though?

01:12:50.626 --> 01:12:53.691
MATT: But I admire you checking for any given
possibility.

01:12:53.691 --> 01:12:56.020
LAURA: 16 for me.

01:12:56.020 --> 01:12:58.409
LIAM: I'm going to use my last Luck.

01:12:58.409 --> 01:13:00.055
SAM: You have inspiration.

01:13:00.055 --> 01:13:01.819
LIAM: Oh, I do, and I can add it to that save,
right?

01:13:01.819 --> 01:13:02.893
SAM: Sure.

01:13:02.893 --> 01:13:09.279
LIAM: Good. Oh, then I'm 29. I rolled 11 off of
that. Thanks for the limerick.

01:13:09.279 --> 01:13:10.738
MATT: What'd you roll?

01:13:10.738 --> 01:13:12.139
LAURA: 16.

01:13:12.139 --> 01:13:16.652
MATT: 16? Okay. So you manage to lift up onto the
broom, almost doing a complete handstand to get

01:13:16.652 --> 01:13:22.473
out of the way, however, the bottom of it catches
your sister in the side of her leg, causes the

01:13:22.473 --> 01:13:30.324
broom to lurch, and begin to lose control of it.
You both manage to hold on to the broom.

01:13:30.324 --> 01:13:31.755
LAURA: That's good.

01:13:31.755 --> 01:13:38.485
MATT: But you, from the impact of the hammer, do
suffer 16 points of bludgeoning damage. As the

01:13:38.485 --> 01:13:45.808
bird, now in a full dive, slams in a giant fiery
crash into the front two gates of the keep.

01:13:45.808 --> 01:13:48.672
LIAM: How close was it to us? If it hit us?

01:13:48.672 --> 01:13:50.815
MATT: It swooped right underneath you.

01:13:50.815 --> 01:13:52.313
LIAM: Can I do an attack of opportunity?

01:13:52.313 --> 01:13:53.967
MATT: No, because you were trying to get out of
the way.

01:13:53.967 --> 01:13:55.136
LIAM: All right.

01:13:55.136 --> 01:13:59.639
MATT: To do that, you would have been fully off
the broom and you would fall.

01:13:59.639 --> 01:14:01.881
LIAM: Understand, understand.

01:14:01.881 --> 01:14:07.231
MATT: As it (swoosh) into this full dive, slams
into the two front gates which explode into a

01:14:07.231 --> 01:14:17.018
cloud of dust, broken rock, masonry, and iron. You
watch as the dust settles briefly. Now the giant

01:14:17.018 --> 01:14:22.822
is stepping off of the back of this giant flaming
bird and looks around, clutching its hammer in its hand.

01:14:22.822 --> 01:14:24.494
LAURA: Fuck.

01:14:24.494 --> 01:14:28.802
(yelling)

01:14:28.802 --> 01:14:34.777
SAM: That's large! That's like from a different
set of action figures.

01:14:34.777 --> 01:14:39.758
TRAVIS: I think the scale is wrong, Matt, I think
you accidentally put things that are bigger than

01:14:39.758 --> 01:14:40.987
us on the map.

01:14:40.987 --> 01:14:43.244
LAURA: This is like when I made my Barbies date my
G.I. Joes.

01:14:43.244 --> 01:14:46.605
(laughter)

01:14:46.605 --> 01:14:49.748
MARISHA: Why is G.I. Joe so much shorter than
Barbie? Damn it!

01:14:49.748 --> 01:14:53.080
TALIESIN: Did the lizard man take damage, by the
way?

01:14:53.080 --> 01:14:57.026
MATT: Actually yeah, as the dust clears, the
lizard men that were at the gate were all

01:14:57.026 --> 01:15:02.203
destroyed in the impact, crushed, their bones
broken, and you can see one arm twitching out of

01:15:02.203 --> 01:15:07.650
the center of the rubble. The doors are currently
blown open and off the hinges, there.

01:15:07.650 --> 01:15:08.811
LAURA: Fuck.

01:15:08.811 --> 01:15:14.103
MATT: All righty, and then--

01:15:14.103 --> 01:15:21.254
SAM: We need some sort of miracle here! What we
need is some sort of miracle!

01:15:21.254 --> 01:15:35.624
MATT: Fresh off the airplane.

01:15:35.624 --> 01:15:40.610
ASHLEY: Hello, everybody!

01:15:40.610 --> 01:15:43.243
LIAM: Divine Intervention!

01:15:43.243 --> 01:15:45.089
SAM: (singing) We need a hero!

01:15:45.089 --> 01:15:47.575
MATT: That is awesome.

01:15:47.575 --> 01:15:52.430
ASHLEY: I've lost my voice a little bit, but you
know what? Fuck it! Der-n-der!

01:15:52.430 --> 01:15:58.442
MATT: I want a shirt that says that. "Fuck it!
Der-n-der!"

01:15:58.442 --> 01:16:01.049
TRAVIS: They'll get that in the store as soon as
possible.

01:16:01.049 --> 01:16:08.505
MATT: Indeed. All righty, so, bringing us to the
top. As they both stand there, the flames still

01:16:08.505 --> 01:16:13.687
emanating out from the impact, the lizardmen
scattered and broken at the gate, the battle still

01:16:13.687 --> 01:16:21.247
waging on in the vicinity, you see as two other
battles over here, the wyvern rider on this wyvern

01:16:21.247 --> 01:16:24.353
is stabbed in the head and is killed. The wyvern
is still around, but it takes another guard out

01:16:24.353 --> 01:16:30.069
behind it. Over here, this guy continues to fight
and takes out two of the guards, but there is

01:16:30.069 --> 01:16:36.990
still one behind that is holding strong. Top of
the round, Vex. What do you want to do, as you

01:16:36.990 --> 01:16:39.991
just barely gather control over the broom again?

01:16:39.991 --> 01:16:49.001
LAURA: Is that within range of you, to throw
something at it and bamf there, or--?

01:16:49.001 --> 01:16:52.602
LIAM: Ish. We'll find out.

01:16:52.602 --> 01:16:57.897
LAURA: I'm going to try to fly over. Am I able to
get to the roof above him?

01:16:57.897 --> 01:17:01.162
MATT: Over here? Yeah, you can.

01:17:01.162 --> 01:17:02.802
LARUA: Okay, I'll go there and land.

01:17:02.802 --> 01:17:14.636
MATT: Okay. So you both make your way over,
landing on the roof. There you can see Xanthas is

01:17:14.636 --> 01:17:21.493
still bound by the vines, his eyes wide. He's
like, "What are you doing? Release me!"

01:17:21.493 --> 01:17:30.677
LAURA: I'm going to ignore him and Hunter's Mark
the giant, and then try to hit him from above.

01:17:30.677 --> 01:17:35.228
MATT: Okay, so, getting right up to the edge,
arrow off to the side, go for it.

01:17:35.228 --> 01:17:40.229
LAURA: 21 on the first one.

01:17:40.229 --> 01:17:42.907
MATT: 21 on the first one? Hits.

01:17:42.907 --> 01:17:47.183
LAURA: Yes! And that's Hunter's Mark and sneak
attack, right?

01:17:47.183 --> 01:17:56.583
MATT: Technically, he went past you, saw you,
impacted you with him-- or she did, sorry-- It is

01:17:56.583 --> 01:18:01.437
well aware where you went and knows that you--
There's no sneak attack. I'm sorry.

01:18:01.437 --> 01:18:04.579
LAURA: Damn it! Fine, fine.

01:18:04.579 --> 01:18:07.345
MATT: You'd have to hide somewhere to try and get
sneak attack.

01:18:07.345 --> 01:18:08.923
LARUA: Oh, and that's a bonus action, right?

01:18:08.923 --> 01:18:11.674
MATT: Correct. Which you used to move your
Hunter's Mark.

01:18:11.674 --> 01:18:14.041
LAURA: Which I did, yeah, so don't worry about
it.

01:18:14.041 --> 01:18:19.936
MATT: Vax, you're up on deck.

01:18:19.936 --> 01:18:26.959
LAURA: 18 plus four lightning damage.

01:18:26.959 --> 01:18:29.075
MATT: 18 plus four, nice.

01:18:29.075 --> 01:18:31.507
LAURA: Oh, and then again! I attack him again!

01:18:31.507 --> 01:18:33.245
MATT: Go for it! One arrow--

01:18:33.245 --> 01:18:38.275
LAURA: And it definitely hits him! It's, like,
30-something.

01:18:38.275 --> 01:18:40.119
MATT: Sure, that hits! Go for it.

01:18:40.119 --> 01:18:53.629
LAURA: Argh. 17 plus four lightning damage!

01:18:53.629 --> 01:19:04.799
MATT: All righty. Both arrows (impact). One slams
into the armor and sticks into it about three or

01:19:04.799 --> 01:19:09.134
four inches, and you can see the giant female fire
giant glances at her shoulder angrily and looks up

01:19:09.134 --> 01:19:10.797
over the top, at you.

01:19:10.797 --> 01:19:13.511
LAURA: Oh, and I want to back up away. I want to
back away from the--

01:19:13.511 --> 01:19:15.200
TRAVIS: I will woo her.

01:19:15.200 --> 01:19:17.067
LAURA: So she can't see me no more!

01:19:17.067 --> 01:19:19.597
MATT: At the full movement it would've taken you
to get there, with your brother on your back,

01:19:19.597 --> 01:19:20.993
that's as far as you can get.

01:19:20.993 --> 01:19:25.942
LAURA: Can I crouch? Is that within my movement,
to crouch?

01:19:25.942 --> 01:19:31.684
MATT: You're crouching, but you're not hiding. You
do have some cover because of the edge of the

01:19:31.684 --> 01:19:38.810
wall. She sees you, but you have a little bit of
cover. Vax, you're up.

01:19:38.810 --> 01:19:41.357
LIAM: Is the giant within 60 feet of me?

01:19:41.357 --> 01:19:45.783
MATT: The giant may or may not be. You currently
have to get over to the edge to see it.

01:19:45.783 --> 01:19:49.254
LIAM: All right, so I'm going to move up to the
edge. I'm going to use my bonus action to cast

01:19:49.254 --> 01:19:50.707
Hunter's Mark.

01:19:50.707 --> 01:19:54.818
SAM: You can't do that! That's not one of your
spells!

01:19:54.818 --> 01:19:57.172
LAURA: We're twins, you guys!

01:19:57.172 --> 01:19:58.960
TRAVIS: Oh my god, I'm going to barf.

01:19:58.960 --> 01:20:00.937
MATT: That's from being a vengeance paladin?

01:20:00.937 --> 01:20:08.533
LIAM: Vengeance paladin, yes. Level up! And then
I'm going to throw Whisper at the back of her head

01:20:08.533 --> 01:20:10.100
and hope that it hits.

01:20:10.100 --> 01:20:11.549
MATT: All right, go for it.

01:20:11.549 --> 01:20:17.797
LIAM: Jeebus. Let's try that again. That is-- I'm
going to use--

01:20:17.797 --> 01:20:19.694
LAURA: No, that's a good hit!

01:20:19.694 --> 01:20:22.807
LIAM: Mm, yeah. 22.

01:20:22.807 --> 01:20:24.190
MATT: 22 hits.

01:20:24.190 --> 01:20:28.727
LIAM: All right. Okay. So-- and I'm going to bamf
there.

01:20:28.727 --> 01:20:31.407
MATT: Okay. No sneak attack on this.

01:20:31.407 --> 01:20:41.174
LIAM: No, I know. And the damage is 12 plus
psychic damage is eight! 20. And then I want to

01:20:41.174 --> 01:20:43.123
use my movement, even though I can't disengage--

01:20:43.123 --> 01:20:44.862
MATT: Did you roll your Hunter's Mark on that?

01:20:44.862 --> 01:20:46.222
LIAM: Oh, no, I-- Thanks, Mattie!

01:20:46.222 --> 01:20:48.005
MATT: You &lt;i&gt;just&lt;/i&gt; used it!

01:20:48.005 --> 01:20:49.510
LIAM: 21. Just one.

01:20:49.510 --> 01:20:52.389
MARISHA: Now people are going to scream "Hunter's
Mark!" at &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; on the internet!

01:20:52.389 --> 01:20:57.848
LIAM: I can't wait! I love you internet! I love
you so much! And then, even though I'm not using

01:20:57.848 --> 01:21:01.252
disengage, I'm going to use my movement to back
the fuck up into that doorway.

01:21:01.252 --> 01:21:09.048
MATT: Okay. As you back up into that doorway, she
swings around, the giant maul arcing in your

01:21:09.048 --> 01:21:13.765
direction. A great maul, actually, specifically.
That is 24 to hit.

01:21:13.765 --> 01:21:20.129
LIAM: I'll use Uncanny Dodge.

01:21:20.129 --> 01:21:25.067
MATT: Okay, in order to take half damage? All
righty, so, that comes to-- oof. This is going to

01:21:25.067 --> 01:21:27.251
be fun for you.

01:21:27.251 --> 01:21:29.076
LIAM: So much fun.

01:21:29.076 --> 01:21:35.979
MATT: All righty, let's get the dice out for this.
Oh, I have the wrong dice. There we go.

01:21:35.979 --> 01:21:42.146
LIAM: Guys, I have 105 hit points. I am swole.

01:21:42.146 --> 01:21:48.095
MARISHA: Welcome to triple digits!
Congratulations, you joined the rest of us!

01:21:48.095 --> 01:21:56.264
MATT: You take 31 bludgeoning damage, halved to
15. It-- whack!-- slams you into the shoulder. You

01:21:56.264 --> 01:22:00.357
dodge out of the way and the momentum actually
hits you and the inertia shoves you into the side

01:22:00.357 --> 01:22:02.724
of the doorway. You catch yourself.

01:22:02.724 --> 01:22:05.070
LIAM: Thank you! (grunting)

01:22:05.070 --> 01:22:08.282
MATT: All right, that ends your turn? Keyleth,
you're up.

01:22:08.282 --> 01:22:15.568
MARISHA: Okay, I am going to Tidal Wave these
motherfuckers. Yeah! Still have that packed from

01:22:15.568 --> 01:22:22.234
the Fire Plane, what's up! So I don't have a-- do
we have a laser pointer in the house?

01:22:22.234 --> 01:22:24.606
TALIESIN: It's not in your bag?

01:22:24.606 --> 01:22:30.578
MARISHA: You know, it's funny. We bought, like,
ten laser pointers, forever ago.

01:22:30.578 --> 01:22:36.657
SAM: You know, it's fine. Matt will just point at
random until he finds the spot that you're looking for.

01:22:36.657 --> 01:22:38.971
TALIESIN: Warmer, warmer, colder, colder, warmer.

01:22:38.971 --> 01:22:40.469
MARISHA: I had a laser pointer.

01:22:40.469 --> 01:22:42.129
LIAM: Here's one, here's one.

01:22:42.129 --> 01:22:43.737
MARISHA: Hey, I think this is mine!

01:22:43.737 --> 01:22:45.099
TRAVIS: Yeah, sure it is!

01:22:45.099 --> 01:22:46.165
LIAM: Use it!

01:22:46.165 --> 01:22:47.925
SAM: Tidal Wave!

01:22:47.925 --> 01:22:53.708
MARISHA: Yeah, 30 feet long, ten foot wide, ten
foot tall. Everything must make a dexterity save.

01:22:53.708 --> 01:22:54.953
MATT: So you're trying to do it this way?

01:22:54.953 --> 01:22:57.029
MARISHA: That's exactly what I'm doing.

01:22:57.029 --> 01:23:00.668
MATT: All right, so it comes bursting through. All
right, they both need to make a dexterity saving

01:23:00.668 --> 01:23:02.579
throw against a DC 19, correct?

01:23:02.579 --> 01:23:04.947
LAURA: 19, yes, right?

01:23:04.947 --> 01:23:06.403
MARISHA: Yep!

01:23:06.403 --> 01:23:15.404
MATT: That is a 17 for the giant, no. And that is
a seven for the roc. So no, they both take 4d8

01:23:15.404 --> 01:23:17.355
bludgeoning damage.

01:23:17.355 --> 01:23:26.509
MARISHA: And they are knocked prone, and if they
are flamey, then all unprotected flames are

01:23:26.509 --> 01:23:27.696
distinguished.

01:23:27.696 --> 01:23:29.293
SAM: Extinguished.

01:23:29.293 --> 01:23:31.350
MATT: It is the creature's nature--

01:23:31.350 --> 01:23:34.532
TALIESIN: They're very distinguished. They have
little fun mustaches.

01:23:34.532 --> 01:23:36.062
MARISHA: They're dapper!

01:23:36.062 --> 01:23:40.557
MATT: They both fall prone, but the nature of
their flames is natural. It is part of their

01:23:40.557 --> 01:23:43.112
actual physicality, so the flames do not get
extinguished.

01:23:43.112 --> 01:23:45.528
MARISHA: So they don't take extra water damage? So
4d8?

01:23:45.528 --> 01:23:50.723
MATT: No, but the water does slam into the bird.
You see steam rise up as it impacts. The flames

01:23:50.723 --> 01:23:54.762
darken a little bit and subside briefly. Both of
them are knocked off their feet into the ground as

01:23:54.762 --> 01:23:59.539
you watch the tidal wave curl up, slam into both
of them, and then spill out and spread across the

01:23:59.539 --> 01:24:01.881
ground, putting out this fire here, actually.

01:24:01.881 --> 01:24:08.301
MARISHA: So 21 damage, and they're knocked prone.
21 damage.

01:24:08.301 --> 01:24:11.726
MATT: Yep, great. That finishes your turn,
Keyleth, or do you want to move?

01:24:11.726 --> 01:24:16.803
MARISHA: I'll stay where I am, actually.

01:24:16.803 --> 01:24:22.901
MATT: Okay. That brings us to the general, as she
stands.

01:24:22.901 --> 01:24:25.802
LAURA: Oh god, she's a general!

01:24:25.802 --> 01:24:36.413
MATT: At half of her movement there. She,
extremely angry, gets up. (growls) "Oh, that's not

01:24:36.413 --> 01:24:37.969
"playing fair!"

01:24:37.969 --> 01:24:40.782
MARISHA: You looked like you needed a bath!

01:24:40.782 --> 01:24:44.844
MATT: Looks back at a piece of the rubble, grabs
it-- actually is going to use her Flaming Anger,

01:24:44.844 --> 01:24:50.768
which is an ability she has. She gets extremely
furious and tenses up. You can see muscles bulging

01:24:50.768 --> 01:24:56.699
in her forehead. She grabs a big chunk of the
nearby rubble. You watch as the rubble,

01:24:56.699 --> 01:25:02.805
already on fire from the impact, the fiery impact
of the site, begins to heat up. Lobs it at you.

01:25:02.805 --> 01:25:04.270
MARISHA: Oh!

01:25:04.270 --> 01:25:11.764
MATT: That is a natural one. As it goes whoosh,
and tumbles past--

01:25:11.764 --> 01:25:13.455
MARISHA: Can I watch it, be like--

01:25:13.455 --> 01:25:17.807
MATT: Yeah, it goes off and actually impacts one
of the wyverns flying through the sky and hits it.

01:25:17.807 --> 01:25:20.781
It goes down over the outer wall.

01:25:20.781 --> 01:25:23.465
LIAM: Echoing from in the gate, you hear, woo!

01:25:23.465 --> 01:25:25.245
MARISHA: You've got a good arm!

01:25:25.245 --> 01:25:29.566
MATT: Using her Flaming Anger, however, she
angrily grabs another piece, this one even larger.

01:25:29.566 --> 01:25:37.126
Both hands over the head, the great maul hanging
at her side, and throws it at you. This time, that

01:25:37.126 --> 01:25:39.782
is a 19 to hit.

01:25:39.782 --> 01:25:42.114
MARISHA: Heh, uh, yeah. That hits.

01:25:42.114 --> 01:25:59.227
MATT: Okay. You suffer 33 points of bludgeoning
damage from the impact, plus ten points of fire

01:25:59.227 --> 01:26:03.714
damage from the heat, as it slams into you, almost
knocking you onto your back. You manage to catch

01:26:03.714 --> 01:26:08.417
yourself, but the pieces of it hit you and then
break apart and fall to the ground around you. You

01:26:08.417 --> 01:26:14.163
find your whole front side charred from the
impact. With the rest of her movement, is going

01:26:14.163 --> 01:26:20.739
to-- let's see, she only has 20 feet. One, two,
three, four, in your direction, picking her great

01:26:20.739 --> 01:26:30.037
maul up with her hand and swinging it. Thank you,
boyfriend glasses delivery. Ends the general's

01:26:30.037 --> 01:26:31.729
turn. Percy, you're up.

01:26:31.729 --> 01:26:33.018
TALIESIN: Okay!

01:26:33.018 --> 01:26:34.517
MATT: Scanlan, you're on deck.

01:26:34.517 --> 01:26:35.877
MARISHA: She throws rocks!

01:26:35.877 --> 01:26:42.705
TALIESIN: Okay, now that this is happening, I've
decided-- I'm already committed to this wyvern and

01:26:42.705 --> 01:26:47.379
rider over in the corner that have not ceased to
be a problem. I assume that they have not ceased

01:26:47.379 --> 01:26:48.817
to be a problem at this point.

01:26:48.817 --> 01:26:51.026
MATT: They're not currently harrying you, no.
They're fighting off guards.

01:26:51.026 --> 01:26:53.262
TALIESIN: But they're going to become a problem if
they kill those guards.

01:26:53.262 --> 01:26:54.468
MATT: Possibly. If they kill the guards.

01:26:54.468 --> 01:27:01.059
TALIESIN: Okay, that'll do! So I'm going to take
three shots at that wyvern. I'm going to start

01:27:01.059 --> 01:27:07.802
shooting at the wyvern. So, first attack. He's
held down by a net?

01:27:07.802 --> 01:27:12.506
MATT: He is, but two of the guys who were holding
the net have died off, so it's almost negligible

01:27:12.506 --> 01:27:15.823
at this point. He can't get the wings going, but
if the net is removed or he manages to get the net

01:27:15.823 --> 01:27:17.359
off, it'll be fine.

01:27:17.359 --> 01:27:25.299
TALIESIN: All right, I'll take a sharpshooter shot
at him. So, that's-- oh, for the fuck's sake.

01:27:25.299 --> 01:27:29.066
That's a gun jam.

01:27:29.066 --> 01:27:30.486
LAURA: Oh no!

01:27:30.486 --> 01:27:32.132
TALIESIN: Yep, that's another one.

01:27:32.132 --> 01:27:33.487
SAM: How many guns you got?

01:27:33.487 --> 01:27:38.016
TALIESIN: I've got a lot, but I keep-- Ugh, god,
that hurt. Okay. That really hurt. Took ten points

01:27:38.016 --> 01:27:44.959
of psychic damage, because that's funny. I'm
irritated. I'm putting that away and I'm pulling

01:27:44.959 --> 01:27:49.494
out Bad News and taking a shot with Bad News at
him because I've got just enough of a round to do

01:27:49.494 --> 01:27:57.397
that. Another sharpshooter shot, because I'm
irritated. Come on. Oh, for fuck's sake.

01:27:57.397 --> 01:27:59.688
LAURA: Oh no!

01:27:59.688 --> 01:28:01.387
TRAVIS: Did you die?

01:28:01.387 --> 01:28:04.624
TALIESIN: Yeah, I died. I'm dead.

01:28:04.624 --> 01:28:07.492
MATT: In a terrible round for Percy, as you walk
forward in the center, you turn to the side, fire

01:28:07.492 --> 01:28:16.005
at the wyvern, get one shot that immediately locks
up. You feel the reeling feedback, psychic

01:28:16.005 --> 01:28:22.054
feedback from Animus, course through you. You put
it away, pull out Bad News, take aim. As you fire,

01:28:22.054 --> 01:28:28.288
that horrible silent click sound as you pull back.
You hold it away from you, just in time, as the

01:28:28.288 --> 01:28:34.672
flame backs up in the butt end of the weapon just
flares outward. You can see, this is going to need

01:28:34.672 --> 01:28:35.976
a little work to get it working again.

01:28:35.976 --> 01:28:44.970
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, but this is getting stupid. You
know, it's almost worth-- It really does suck.

01:28:44.970 --> 01:28:46.386
That legit sucks.

01:28:46.386 --> 01:28:51.011
MATT: You want to move, or anything else you want to do
on your turn?

01:28:51.011 --> 01:28:59.363
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, no, I am. I'm paying a deadly
price for this shit right now. I'm going to run

01:28:59.363 --> 01:29:10.295
toward the-- that's some sort of bastille weapon
over there? Is there a-- No, to your-- yeah, right there.

01:29:10.295 --> 01:29:13.710
MATT: Right there? That is a crate and a chest.

01:29:13.710 --> 01:29:16.370
TALIESIN: What's the thing in the circle?

01:29:16.370 --> 01:29:19.519
MATT: Oh, this right here, you mean? Oh, that is
one of the trebuchets that you had repaired and

01:29:19.519 --> 01:29:21.009
one of the ones that isn't damaged yet.

01:29:21.009 --> 01:29:22.268
TALIESIN: I'm running toward it.

01:29:22.268 --> 01:29:25.549
SAM: Oh yeah, use the battlefield!

01:29:25.549 --> 01:29:27.745
MARISHA: Press 'x' to use!

01:29:27.745 --> 01:29:33.710
MATT: There you go. It is loaded. It has not been
used. It looks like the men that were currently

01:29:33.710 --> 01:29:38.226
fighting the wyvern across the way had loaded it
up and then were assaulted when they threw the net

01:29:38.226 --> 01:29:41.592
over. So it currently is ready for use.

01:29:41.592 --> 01:29:42.938
TALIESIN: Okay!

01:29:42.938 --> 01:29:44.256
MARISHA: Hot.

01:29:44.256 --> 01:29:49.540
MATT: It is a difficult thing to aim. That ends
Percy's turn. Scanlan, you're up.

01:29:49.540 --> 01:29:56.406
SAM: I'm going to move over to the right, towards
Grog, a bit. Just to get away from everybody else.

01:29:56.406 --> 01:30:01.883
And I will-- We need to hit this giant, right?

01:30:01.883 --> 01:30:03.334
LAURA: Yeah! Kill it!

01:30:03.334 --> 01:30:08.836
SAM: So I will (sings) Bigby's Hand! But I have
very few spell slots left, so it's going to have

01:30:08.836 --> 01:30:10.605
to be at level seven.

01:30:10.605 --> 01:30:13.400
MATT: Okay. 7th-level Bigby's Hand.

01:30:13.400 --> 01:30:16.899
SAM: I will punch him in his giant solar plexus.

01:30:16.899 --> 01:30:17.902
MATT: The giant?

01:30:17.902 --> 01:30:19.958
SAM: Her! Her giant solar plexus. It's a she.

01:30:19.958 --> 01:30:21.456
MATT: Yes it is.

01:30:21.456 --> 01:30:23.143
LIAM: It's ten feet above your head.

01:30:23.143 --> 01:30:28.342
SAM: Okay. With my hand cone, if that helps.

01:30:28.342 --> 01:30:29.798
LIAM: Fuck, that shirt.

01:30:29.798 --> 01:30:31.217
MATT: With your hand cone.

01:30:31.217 --> 01:30:33.615
LIAM: Hold the hand cone to the shirt.

01:30:33.615 --> 01:30:36.083
LAURA: Just, like, right here.

01:30:36.083 --> 01:30:38.944
(laughter)

01:30:38.944 --> 01:30:44.874
MATT: All righty, so Bigby's Hand appears, goes
into a Clenched Fist. Go ahead and make a spell

01:30:44.874 --> 01:30:46.117
attack.

01:30:46.117 --> 01:30:49.644
SAM: Oh! Because it's a melee attack-- spell
attack?

01:30:49.644 --> 01:30:51.450
MATT: Correct.

01:30:51.450 --> 01:30:53.545
SAM: 21.

01:30:53.545 --> 01:30:58.343
MATT: 21 hits! And so it's cast at seventh level.

01:30:58.343 --> 01:31:00.337
SAM: Yes, it's 8d8.

01:31:00.337 --> 01:31:01.511
LAURA: Whoa!

01:31:01.511 --> 01:31:02.834
LIAM: So handsome!

01:31:02.834 --> 01:31:05.364
SAM: Do you have any d8s over here?

01:31:05.364 --> 01:31:07.163
TALIESIN: I do. There's another d8.

01:31:07.163 --> 01:31:08.453
MARISHA: Here's some more.

01:31:08.453 --> 01:31:12.389
SAM: Okay. Oh wow! That's all of them. That's
eight.

01:31:12.389 --> 01:31:16.787
MARISHA: It feels better that way. Ooh! Those are
good rolls!

01:31:16.787 --> 01:31:18.896
TALIESIN: Those are very nice-looking d8s.

01:31:18.896 --> 01:31:25.499
MATT: Oh, Vax? I also need you to make a
constitution saving roll.

01:31:25.499 --> 01:31:26.870
LIAM: Great.

01:31:26.870 --> 01:31:27.998
SAM: 40.

01:31:27.998 --> 01:31:29.736
MATT: 40! Ooh!

01:31:29.736 --> 01:31:31.292
LIAM: For what?

01:31:31.292 --> 01:31:34.577
MATT: You have a concentration check for your
Hunter's Mark?

01:31:34.577 --> 01:31:39.463
LIAM: Oh, awesome! I love-- I know all about
spells! It's a one.

01:31:39.463 --> 01:31:40.564
LAURA: Oh no!

01:31:40.564 --> 01:31:42.262
LIAM: But I have Luck, so I'm going to roll again

01:31:42.262 --> 01:31:43.535
MATT: Okay. Go ahead.

01:31:43.535 --> 01:31:46.307
LIAM: I have Luck! It's within the rules, yeah.
Concentration, straight--

01:31:46.307 --> 01:31:47.905
MATT: No-- constitution, yeah.

01:31:47.905 --> 01:31:49.153
LIAM: Constitution, straight 16.

01:31:49.153 --> 01:31:53.524
MATT: Okay, you maintain concentration, you're
fine. All right, so, as you conjure Bigby's Hand,

01:31:53.524 --> 01:31:57.790
you see the purple energy trail off your fingers,
and as your bring your hand back into an uppercut

01:31:57.790 --> 01:32:01.287
motion, you watch as the air in front of the
giant, and she begins stomping forward in the

01:32:01.287 --> 01:32:07.366
direction of Keyleth and Pike, the energy forms
into this giant purple fist of smoke that just

01:32:07.366 --> 01:32:14.057
sucker-punches her right in the gut. She looks
down, confused and angry, at this fist that turns

01:32:14.057 --> 01:32:15.823
into a middle finger immediately.

01:32:15.823 --> 01:32:17.405
(laughter)

01:32:17.405 --> 01:32:18.659
ASHLEY: Yeah!

01:32:18.659 --> 01:32:19.818
SAM: You know me well.

01:32:19.818 --> 01:32:21.786
MATT: You've moved ten feet that way. You still
have--

01:32:21.786 --> 01:32:24.501
SAM: Is anyone within range of my Healing Words?

01:32:24.501 --> 01:32:29.007
MATT: You have, looks to be Pike, Keyleth and Grog
all within range.

01:32:29.007 --> 01:32:30.612
SAM: Keyleth's hurt, right?

01:32:30.612 --> 01:32:31.859
MARISHA: I am hurt.

01:32:31.859 --> 01:32:36.644
SAM: Okay. I will give her some Healing Words.

01:32:36.644 --> 01:32:38.139
MATT: Second level?

01:32:38.139 --> 01:32:41.220
MARISHA: Heal me. With your words.

01:32:41.220 --> 01:32:47.576
SAM: I will heal you with my words. So that's 2d4
plus six, right? Wow, awesome. Eight.

01:32:47.576 --> 01:32:48.991
(laughter)

01:32:48.991 --> 01:32:50.806
MARISHA: All right. I'll take it.

01:32:50.806 --> 01:32:52.890
MATT: All righty.

01:32:52.890 --> 01:32:55.185
MARISHA: Yeah, 71 hit points.

01:32:55.185 --> 01:33:14.219
MATT: There you go. That ends Scanlan's turn. All
right, so. Vex, I need you to make a wisdom saving

01:33:14.219 --> 01:33:15.723
throw, if you could?

01:33:15.723 --> 01:33:21.755
LAURA: Oh, that asshole that I'm standing next to.
Fucking dick!

01:33:21.755 --> 01:33:23.492
ASHLEY: Get him.

01:33:23.492 --> 01:33:26.697
LAURA: That's a seven.

01:33:26.697 --> 01:33:32.341
MATT: It's a seven. As you, looking off the side,
getting your arrows ready for a second round, you

01:33:32.341 --> 01:33:36.511
can hear a couple of whispers off to your side. As
you glance over, you make eye contact with

01:33:36.511 --> 01:33:42.324
Xanthas, who has managed to shrug off the bramble
vines around his body. As soon as he finishes

01:33:42.324 --> 01:33:47.506
talking, he points a finger towards you. And
you're listening. You snap to attention.

01:33:47.506 --> 01:33:49.190
SAM: Oh no.

01:33:49.190 --> 01:33:54.908
MATT: And he goes, "Why don't you take a walk off
the edge of that tower right there?"

01:33:54.908 --> 01:33:56.484
ASHLEY: No!

01:33:56.484 --> 01:34:01.105
SAM: (whispers) Wait a second, you can't do that!

01:34:01.105 --> 01:34:06.836
LAURA: But when I'm doing it, I'm also still
intelligent, right?

01:34:06.836 --> 01:34:11.645
MATT: You're still intelligent, oh.

01:34:11.645 --> 01:34:14.719
TRAVIS: Oh, and you look good doing it. You look
good walking right off that edge.

01:34:14.719 --> 01:34:23.055
LAURA: I'm going to walk off of it. I look at him,
I walk off it. Can I pull out my broom as I walk

01:34:23.055 --> 01:34:28.644
off the edge and land on the broom? Because I did
what he told me, technically?

01:34:28.644 --> 01:34:30.575
MATT: Yeah, so he's a--

01:34:30.575 --> 01:34:33.517
ASHLEY: But he didn't say to not use your broom.

01:34:33.517 --> 01:34:37.548
MATT: Just double-checking to make sure I could
make him do this.

01:34:37.548 --> 01:34:42.895
ALL: (singing) Off the catwalk.

01:34:42.895 --> 01:34:45.741
SAM: I don't think you can command someone to hurt
themselves.

01:34:45.741 --> 01:34:49.840
MATT: It doesn't say that you can't.

01:34:49.840 --> 01:34:52.120
SAM: Really?

01:34:52.120 --> 01:34:54.354
LAURA: Really?!

01:34:54.354 --> 01:34:57.275
MATT: Each time it takes damage, it gets to retake
the saving throw.

01:34:57.275 --> 01:35:03.248
TALIESIN: Once you complete his instructions, you
can do anything you want.

01:35:03.248 --> 01:35:06.110
LAURA: No, that's what I mean. I'm going to walk
off the edge and pull out the broom.

01:35:06.110 --> 01:35:07.576
MATT: Okay.

01:35:07.576 --> 01:35:10.105
LAURA: And just fly.

01:35:10.105 --> 01:35:18.130
MATT: Okay. Yeah. So you come up and you go off
the edge. And you have the broom there. All right.

01:35:18.130 --> 01:35:23.494
And you're coasting there with your broom.

01:35:23.494 --> 01:35:27.884
LAURA: And I give him a thumbs-up. Thanks, Boss!

01:35:27.884 --> 01:35:38.324
MATT: And he darts down the stairs into the
building. And as he's rushing off, he's like, "All

01:35:38.324 --> 01:35:40.237
"right. Shoot your friends!"

01:35:40.237 --> 01:35:41.799
(laughter)

01:35:41.799 --> 01:35:44.228
MATT: He shouts it over his shoulder as he goes.

01:35:44.228 --> 01:35:46.311
(laughter)

01:35:46.311 --> 01:35:48.301
LIAM: That was awesome.

01:35:48.301 --> 01:35:52.384
MATT: So now it is Pike's turn.

01:35:52.384 --> 01:36:01.796
ASHLEY: Okay. So, getting up to speed here. So
Percy's kind of low?

01:36:01.796 --> 01:36:03.093
TRAVIS: Percy!

01:36:03.093 --> 01:36:04.574
TALIESIN: Yes, I'm low.

01:36:04.574 --> 01:36:07.794
ASHLEY: Okay. I have on my Sprinter's Boots.

01:36:07.794 --> 01:36:09.388
MARISHA: You're next to me.

01:36:09.388 --> 01:36:10.691
ASHLEY: I'm next to you?

01:36:10.691 --> 01:36:13.664
LAURA: And Percy's over by the trebuchet in the
corner.

01:36:13.664 --> 01:36:19.338
ASHLEY: Can I make it to the trebuchet in the
corner with my Sprinter's Boots or even without?

01:36:19.338 --> 01:36:22.364
MATT: Not without, you couldn't. You could, but it
would take your whole turn.

01:36:22.364 --> 01:36:24.002
ASHLEY: Okay, then I will use my Sprinter's
Boots.

01:36:24.002 --> 01:36:25.492
MATT: All right.

01:36:25.492 --> 01:36:27.750
LIAM: You sound like you're an actual gnome.

01:36:27.750 --> 01:36:29.167
LAURA: Yeah, you really do.

01:36:29.167 --> 01:36:30.361
MATT: You get over there at the trebuchet.

01:36:30.361 --> 01:36:34.521
ASHLEY: Okay. So I'll cast Cure Wounds-- Percy?

01:36:34.521 --> 01:36:39.273
LAURA: Taliesin, you guys are talking so loud.

01:36:39.273 --> 01:36:43.885
SAM: Controversial spell use over here--
Controversial! It will be addressed on Talks

01:36:43.885 --> 01:36:44.742
Machina!

01:36:44.742 --> 01:36:48.255
TALIESIN: He's trying to argue that you'll be
taking damage and I'm trying to show him that he's wrong.

01:36:48.255 --> 01:36:49.367
LAURA: Oh.

01:36:49.367 --> 01:36:50.616
TALIESIN: Sorry.

01:36:50.616 --> 01:36:51.654
LAURA: Thank you, Percy.

01:36:51.654 --> 01:36:52.955
TALIESIN: You're welcome.

01:36:52.955 --> 01:36:54.602
LAURA: Damn you, Scanlan.

01:36:54.602 --> 01:36:55.743
SAM: If I were DM-ing--

01:36:55.743 --> 01:36:57.782
LIAM: (air horn sounds)

01:36:57.782 --> 01:36:58.865
(laughter)

01:36:58.865 --> 01:36:59.944
LIAM: Is that okay?

01:36:59.944 --> 01:37:00.835
MATT: I'll allow it.

01:37:00.835 --> 01:37:02.319
LIAM: It was on them.

01:37:02.319 --> 01:37:04.352
MATT: Pike?

01:37:04.352 --> 01:37:09.949
ASHLEY: No, because now I can't do it to Scanlan.
Okay, so what are you at?

01:37:09.949 --> 01:37:11.652
TALIESIN: I'm at 59.

01:37:11.652 --> 01:37:16.081
ASHLEY: Okay. So let's do a 3rd-level Cure
Wounds.

01:37:16.081 --> 01:37:17.335
TALIESIN: That'll do.

01:37:17.335 --> 01:37:23.273
MATT: Okay. by the way, you used one earlier. So
you have one more 3rd-level spell slot after this.

01:37:23.273 --> 01:37:25.483
LAURA: Matt did a 3rd-level spell.

01:37:25.483 --> 01:37:27.693
MATT: Before you got here. Just so you know.

01:37:27.693 --> 01:37:33.999
ASHLEY: Okay. Maybe I should do-- I'm going to do
a fourth level. Because we need you.

01:37:33.999 --> 01:37:37.580
TALIESIN: Okay. I'm not very-- I'm not being very
useful at the moment, but yeah. I'll get back there.

01:37:37.580 --> 01:37:41.277
ASHLEY: Well, you're at the trebuchet now. Okay.

01:37:41.277 --> 01:37:43.984
MATT: Grog, you're on deck, by the way.

01:37:43.984 --> 01:37:51.354
TRAVIS: Can I ask you a question while she's
waiting?

01:37:51.354 --> 01:37:52.696
MATT: Sure.

01:37:52.696 --> 01:37:56.460
TRAVIS: A prone enemy. Do you get advantage on
them? If they're prone?

01:37:56.460 --> 01:37:58.708
MATT: If they are prone, with melee attacks in the
vicinity?

01:37:58.708 --> 01:38:00.645
TRAVIS: That's a natural crit, right? No,
that's--

01:38:00.645 --> 01:38:02.317
MATT: No, it has advantage if you're within five
feet of it.

01:38:02.317 --> 01:38:03.890
TRAVIS: Got it.

01:38:03.890 --> 01:38:19.072
ASHLEY: 23.

01:38:19.072 --> 01:38:21.034
LAURA: 23, Percy!

01:38:21.034 --> 01:38:22.586
TALIESIN: Yay! Thank you!

01:38:22.586 --> 01:38:31.215
ASHLEY: And then-- shoot! I was going to do
something before I moved, but I forgot. So now,

01:38:31.215 --> 01:38:42.281
for my bonus action, I'm going to create a
beautiful, divine sword, Spiritual Weapon, and put

01:38:42.281 --> 01:38:45.950
it up to the belly of the giant.

01:38:45.950 --> 01:38:47.937
SAM: Ooh, yeah!

01:38:47.937 --> 01:38:51.871
MATT: All right. At what level are you casting
this?

01:38:51.871 --> 01:38:53.528
LAURA: (whispers) Cast it really high.

01:38:53.528 --> 01:38:56.456
MATT: You've already used your 3rd-level--
4th-level spell, so you have to use your

01:38:56.456 --> 01:38:57.583
2nd-level.

01:38:57.583 --> 01:39:01.737
ASHLEY: I have four 3rd-levels, so I think I
actually have an extra 3rd-level. Because of the

01:39:01.737 --> 01:39:02.919
necklace.

01:39:02.919 --> 01:39:05.682
MATT: Okay. You have an extra one, then. But do
keep in mind, you've already cast a 3rd-level

01:39:05.682 --> 01:39:09.828
spell this round-- a 4th-level spell, so if you're
doing a bonus action, it can only be 2nd-level or

01:39:09.828 --> 01:39:11.621
lower. So it would be at 2nd-level.

01:39:11.621 --> 01:39:13.093
ASHLEY: All right.

01:39:13.093 --> 01:39:16.804
SAM: Can you use four 3rd-level spells to be one
12th-level spell?

01:39:16.804 --> 01:39:18.339
(laughter)

01:39:18.339 --> 01:39:19.569
MATT: Sure. Why not?

01:39:19.569 --> 01:39:21.389
(laughter)

01:39:21.389 --> 01:39:25.847
MARISHA: Because I want to do a
Fire-transport-via-plants-ball.

01:39:25.847 --> 01:39:27.853
ASHLEY: Okay, I'll just do it at second.

01:39:27.853 --> 01:39:29.699
MATT: That would be messy.

01:39:29.699 --> 01:39:31.568
ASHLEY: I'll just do it at second level, then.

01:39:31.568 --> 01:39:36.085
MATT: Okay. All right, that ends your turn, Pike?
All right. Grog?

01:39:36.085 --> 01:39:45.352
TRAVIS: I'll run up to the bird-fire creature. And
taking advantage of him being on the ground, I

01:39:45.352 --> 01:39:53.141
would like to go into a frenzied rage! And I would
like to whale on this piece of shit.

01:39:53.141 --> 01:39:54.388
MATT: Go for it.

01:39:54.388 --> 01:39:55.705
TRAVIS: At advantage, right?

01:39:55.705 --> 01:39:56.551
MATT: Yes.

01:39:56.551 --> 01:39:58.257
TRAVIS: Not as a-- I don't have to declare
Reckless?

01:39:58.257 --> 01:39:59.298
MATT: Correct.

01:39:59.298 --> 01:40:07.979
TRAVIS: Great! I will do Great Weapon Master. That
and minus five is 22?

01:40:07.979 --> 01:40:09.579
MATT: 22 hits.

01:40:09.579 --> 01:40:15.831
TRAVIS: Nice! Second one is 14, 28 minus-- that is
23?

01:40:15.831 --> 01:40:17.614
MATT: Hits.

01:40:17.614 --> 01:40:24.499
TRAVIS: Six minus-- 21.

01:40:24.499 --> 01:40:25.512
MATT: Hits.

01:40:25.512 --> 01:40:26.680
TRAVIS: Nice!

01:40:26.680 --> 01:40:27.999
MATT: All three hit.

01:40:27.999 --> 01:40:29.195
TRAVIS: All three hit.

01:40:29.195 --> 01:40:30.407
LIAM: Get him, Grog.

01:40:30.407 --> 01:40:36.537
TRAVIS: 18. Necrotic, four points. Oh god! 21. 31
for the first one.

01:40:36.537 --> 01:40:37.999
MATT: Nice.

01:40:37.999 --> 01:40:42.443
TRAVIS: 33.

01:40:42.443 --> 01:40:47.131
MATT: Okay.

01:40:47.131 --> 01:40:54.523
TRAVIS: And the third one. 20, 30.

01:40:54.523 --> 01:40:58.899
MATT: 30. All right, that's 64 points of damage in
one round against the creature.

01:40:58.899 --> 01:41:00.088
LAURA: What?!

01:41:00.088 --> 01:41:03.986
MATT: As you rush in and start whaling on it, you
almost don't notice the proximity of it. The heat

01:41:03.986 --> 01:41:09.662
is so hot that you suffer ten points of fire
damage just being that close to it. Your skin

01:41:09.662 --> 01:41:12.340
starts to burn and the edges of your beard begins
to singe and curl in.

01:41:12.340 --> 01:41:18.747
TRAVIS: Hey, hey! That sucks! Ten points of
burning damage.

01:41:18.747 --> 01:41:20.576
MATT: Correct.

01:41:20.576 --> 01:41:23.331
TRAVIS: "Burning" damage.

01:41:23.331 --> 01:41:25.517
MATT: All right. That ends your turn?

01:41:25.517 --> 01:41:26.553
TRAVIS: It does.

01:41:26.553 --> 01:41:29.292
MATT: All right. With that, it goes to the large
ember-roc's turn.

01:41:29.292 --> 01:41:30.691
TRAVIS: (laughs) Hi!

01:41:30.691 --> 01:41:32.475
(laughter)

01:41:32.475 --> 01:41:44.042
MATT: All righty. It's going to go ahead and use
an action to attempt its Inferno.

01:41:44.042 --> 01:41:45.289
TRAVIS: Its what?

01:41:45.289 --> 01:41:49.774
MATT: Its Inferno. It begins to beat its wings
extremely heavily. And as it does, the heated air

01:41:49.774 --> 01:41:55.507
and the flames begin to billow up from around it.
I need you to make a dexterity saving throw, Grog.

01:41:55.507 --> 01:41:59.698
TRAVIS: Do I get advantage on these when I'm
raging? I do, because I have Danger Sense.

01:41:59.698 --> 01:42:01.369
MATT: You do.

01:42:01.369 --> 01:42:04.446
TRAVIS: Natural 20.

01:42:04.446 --> 01:42:10.297
(cheering, air horn sounds)

01:42:10.297 --> 01:42:14.937
MATT: All right. Oh, that's-- good thing, too,
that was six, six, five, four on the d4 roll. That

01:42:14.937 --> 01:42:21.633
was nice. All right, so that is 21 points of fire
damage, reduced to half. So ten.

01:42:21.633 --> 01:42:22.646
TRAVIS: Okay.

01:42:22.646 --> 01:42:25.042
MATT: Ten points of fire damage, again. And you
are not blown back.

01:42:25.042 --> 01:42:26.551
TRAVIS: How's the beard doing?

01:42:26.551 --> 01:42:31.455
MATT: It's burning a little bit, you're starting
to smell the hair singeing, it's making you angry

01:42:31.455 --> 01:42:33.191
even in your-- angrier

01:42:33.191 --> 01:42:34.784
TRAVIS: Just like Hagrid's, with the dragon egg?

01:42:34.784 --> 01:42:39.486
MATT: A little bit, yeah. You're like, oh god!
However, you do not get pushed back, and as it's

01:42:39.486 --> 01:42:43.116
taking off with its wings, as part of the
maneuver, you do get an attack of opportunity at

01:42:43.116 --> 01:42:44.814
it, if you want to take it.

01:42:44.814 --> 01:42:46.415
ASHLEY: Get him.

01:42:46.415 --> 01:42:52.398
TRAVIS: Reckless. 21.

01:42:52.398 --> 01:42:55.353
MATT: 40. It doesn't get all way over to them, it
gets--

01:42:55.353 --> 01:42:57.566
ASHLEY: Go away.

01:42:57.566 --> 01:42:59.862
SAM: Go away.

01:42:59.862 --> 01:43:01.874
TRAVIS: It's a 21.

01:43:01.874 --> 01:43:08.086
MATT: 21 hits. Go ahead and roll damage. It swoops
in the air, as you smash your axe in the air

01:43:08.086 --> 01:43:09.190
towards--

01:43:09.190 --> 01:43:10.340
(crash offscreen)

01:43:10.340 --> 01:43:11.791
Like that.

01:43:11.791 --> 01:43:13.204
(laughter)

01:43:13.204 --> 01:43:14.625
MATT: How much damage?

01:43:14.625 --> 01:43:16.772
TRAVIS: 23 with one point of necrotic.

01:43:16.772 --> 01:43:22.639
MATT: Nice. 23. And you smack it, it shrieks in
the impact, but its wings still (whoosh), it arcs

01:43:22.639 --> 01:43:26.984
over and lands on the ground, right behind Pike
and Percy. You guys feel the impact.

01:43:26.984 --> 01:43:28.898
TRAVIS: We were just starting to talk! Come on!

01:43:28.898 --> 01:43:35.473
MATT: All right. Top of the round now. This fellow
over here, who's now been loading up the ballista,

01:43:35.473 --> 01:43:37.892
is going to go ahead and fire it at the bird.

01:43:37.892 --> 01:43:39.001
TALIESIN: Yeah!

01:43:39.001 --> 01:43:40.335
SAM: It's our guy.

01:43:40.335 --> 01:43:41.668
TRAVIS: It's a bird.

01:43:41.668 --> 01:43:42.988
MATT: That actually hits.

01:43:42.988 --> 01:43:44.569
(cheering)

01:43:44.569 --> 01:43:45.686
TRAVIS: Percy!

01:43:45.686 --> 01:43:50.295
MATT: That is 12 points of piercing damage.

01:43:50.295 --> 01:43:52.255
LAURA: Good job, Percy! Good job!

01:43:52.255 --> 01:43:54.347
TALIESIN: I had a whole crew of people. I've got
people.

01:43:54.347 --> 01:43:55.837
MARISHA: I got friends.

01:43:55.837 --> 01:44:01.158
MATT: All righty. And over here, during this fray,
this guy manages to destroy the last guard,

01:44:01.158 --> 01:44:04.216
dispatch him and get the rest of the net off.

01:44:04.216 --> 01:44:06.306
LAURA: Oh no.

01:44:06.306 --> 01:44:09.820
MATT: So that takes his full turn, but now that is
available over there.

01:44:09.820 --> 01:44:11.731
MARISHA: He's available, yo!

01:44:11.731 --> 01:44:16.720
MATT: These three guards, one of them dies but in
the process, they do manage to hack down the rest

01:44:16.720 --> 01:44:18.839
of the wyverns, the wyvern does die.

01:44:18.839 --> 01:44:20.093
LAURA: Yay.

01:44:20.093 --> 01:44:27.370
MATT: This wyvern does dispatch the last guard,
however, and manages to take off its chain, which

01:44:27.370 --> 01:44:30.381
is currently lodged into the back of the wyvern.
It pulls it forth from the wound with a spray of

01:44:30.381 --> 01:44:34.338
blood, and now the wyvern is no longer bound. So
you now have two wyvern riders on the

01:44:34.338 --> 01:44:35.338
battlefield.

01:44:35.338 --> 01:44:37.628
TRAVIS: Oh, so much fun. Awesome.

01:44:37.628 --> 01:44:41.184
MATT: Vex, it's your turn. You have to attack your
friends.

01:44:41.184 --> 01:44:42.943
LAURA: I don't get to make a saving throw?

01:44:42.943 --> 01:44:44.460
MATT: At the end of your turn, you do.

01:44:44.460 --> 01:44:45.849
LAURA: Fuck!

01:44:45.849 --> 01:44:52.430
MATT: Actually, Dominate Person, I don't think you
do! It's when you take damage. Let me see. Yeah.

01:44:52.430 --> 01:44:58.871
LAURA: Maybe he has to tell me who to attack.

01:44:58.871 --> 01:45:00.253
TALIESIN: It's take damage.

01:45:00.253 --> 01:45:01.988
LAURA: It's when I take damage?

01:45:01.988 --> 01:45:04.582
TALIESIN: You have to take damage, you have to
complete all of your actions.

01:45:04.582 --> 01:45:07.040
LAURA: Oh, shit! I should have just fallen off the
fucking roof.

01:45:07.040 --> 01:45:08.674
MATT: That was your choice.

01:45:08.674 --> 01:45:10.539
TALIESIN: You can't do that now, though.

01:45:10.539 --> 01:45:13.846
MATT: Nope. You are on your broom, and you look
down, and the person who's closest to you of your

01:45:13.846 --> 01:45:21.130
friends is Grog. And so you're like, "Well, I've
got to attack my friends." Make two shots against him.

01:45:21.130 --> 01:45:23.169
LAURA: I'm sorry, Grog.

01:45:23.169 --> 01:45:24.982
TRAVIS: I don't believe you.

01:45:24.982 --> 01:45:26.390
LAURA: Oh! Natural one!

01:45:26.390 --> 01:45:28.273
(laughter)

01:45:28.273 --> 01:45:29.914
TRAVIS: It's true!

01:45:29.914 --> 01:45:30.847
LAURA: And 20!

01:45:30.847 --> 01:45:33.059
TRAVIS: Oh. That's a 20-- Oh. I thought you meant
natural.

01:45:33.059 --> 01:45:34.197
LAURA: No, no, no.

01:45:34.197 --> 01:45:38.787
MATT: 20 hits. So go ahead and roll damage against
Grog with one arrow. Grog, as you angrily finish

01:45:38.787 --> 01:45:43.611
slashing as the ember-roc flies overhead, one
arrow hits the ground next to you. You're like,

01:45:43.611 --> 01:45:48.834
"What the hell?" And then you feel the pain right
in the back of the neck as an arrow has embedded

01:45:48.834 --> 01:45:52.097
itself about two inches into your meaty goliath
throat.

01:45:52.097 --> 01:45:54.827
LAURA: 15 piercing damage.

01:45:54.827 --> 01:45:56.874
TRAVIS: Halved to seven?

01:45:56.874 --> 01:46:02.261
LAURA: I didn't even Hunter's Mark you, Grog! I'm
sorry!

01:46:02.261 --> 01:46:05.501
MATT: Remember, you don't halve the lightning
damage it deals.

01:46:05.501 --> 01:46:06.932
LAURA: I don't?

01:46:06.932 --> 01:46:11.024
MATT: No. Because the lightning damage is
different beyond the piercing. So how much is--?

01:46:11.024 --> 01:46:12.573
LAURA: Oh. It was four lightning damage.

01:46:12.573 --> 01:46:14.025
MATT: Okay.

01:46:14.025 --> 01:46:15.788
TRAVIS: So, total four-- and then the other
half--?

01:46:15.788 --> 01:46:18.459
LAURA: It was 11 piercing damage.

01:46:18.459 --> 01:46:25.910
MATT: So you take five plus four, so you take nine
points of damage total from that shot. All right.

01:46:25.910 --> 01:46:27.452
LAURA: Sorry.

01:46:27.452 --> 01:46:29.575
TRAVIS: That's okay, I'll get you later.

01:46:29.575 --> 01:46:31.619
MATT: You're going to stand there for a moment
and--

01:46:31.619 --> 01:46:33.751
LAURA: That's it? That's all I do?

01:46:33.751 --> 01:46:36.572
MATT: I mean, you can move around if you want to.
You've just got to attack your friends when it

01:46:36.572 --> 01:46:37.927
comes to your action.

01:46:37.927 --> 01:46:40.591
ASHLEY: How do we get-- we have to--

01:46:40.591 --> 01:46:42.147
TRAVIS: Punch yourself in the face!

01:46:42.147 --> 01:46:43.412
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:46:43.412 --> 01:46:45.422
LAURA: I can't. I don't know to punch myself in
the face.

01:46:45.422 --> 01:46:47.076
TRAVIS: I'm going to punch you in the face.

01:46:47.076 --> 01:46:49.743
SAM: Vex is working with them! Kill her.

01:46:49.743 --> 01:46:51.585
(laughter)

01:46:51.585 --> 01:46:53.366
SAM: I knew this day would come.

01:46:53.366 --> 01:46:56.693
LAURA: I'm not aware of what I'm doing. I just
think, "I need to kill my friends."

01:46:56.693 --> 01:46:58.533
MATT: Yeah, it's an impulse. It's like, "Okay, no
worries."

01:46:58.533 --> 01:47:03.351
LAURA: Okay. I'm just going to be up here!
Shooting you guys!

01:47:03.351 --> 01:47:07.922
MATT: Okay. That ends Vex's turn. Vax?

01:47:07.922 --> 01:47:12.628
LIAM: If I go four down diagonally towards the
giant, I'll be within ten feet, yeah?

01:47:12.628 --> 01:47:13.950
MATT: This way?

01:47:13.950 --> 01:47:15.082
LIAM: Yeah.

01:47:15.082 --> 01:47:19.479
MATT: Three, four, five. You can get within ten
feet, or you can get right up to it if you want to.

01:47:19.479 --> 01:47:21.170
LIAM: I don't want to.

01:47:21.170 --> 01:47:22.761
MATT: Okay, so you can get within ten feet of
her.

01:47:22.761 --> 01:47:26.402
LIAM: Yeah. I am going to use bonus action to cast
Vow of Enmity against her.

01:47:26.402 --> 01:47:27.726
MATT: Okay.

01:47:27.726 --> 01:47:28.960
MARISHA: That sounds awesome.

01:47:28.960 --> 01:47:32.693
LIAM: With the feathers bristling in my armor. And
then I'm going to use the rest of my movement to

01:47:32.693 --> 01:47:36.345
back straight back towards the wall, another two
or three squares, I think.

01:47:36.345 --> 01:47:38.025
ASHLEY: Dang it, you're so cool!

01:47:38.025 --> 01:47:43.692
LIAM: And I'm going to chuck-- well, we're good.
We've got Bigby's Hand right in her private area.

01:47:43.692 --> 01:47:46.689
But I'm now going to throw Whisper at her back.

01:47:46.689 --> 01:47:47.963
MATT: Okay.

01:47:47.963 --> 01:47:50.976
LIAM: And I should have advantage because she's
busy.

01:47:50.976 --> 01:47:53.044
MATT: Well, advantage because she's busy--

01:47:53.044 --> 01:47:54.496
LAURA: And your vow.

01:47:54.496 --> 01:47:56.682
LIAM: Well, and the vow. Either way. It doesn't
stack.

01:47:56.682 --> 01:47:58.893
MATT: No, you have advantage on attack rolls
against the creature for one minute.

01:47:58.893 --> 01:48:00.071
LIAM: Right.

01:48:00.071 --> 01:48:01.204
MATT: Yeah.

01:48:01.204 --> 01:48:02.654
LIAM: That or Bigby's.

01:48:02.654 --> 01:48:04.199
MATT: Well, Bigby's isn't threatening,
technically. So it's--

01:48:04.199 --> 01:48:05.754
LIAM: So 26 to hit.

01:48:05.754 --> 01:48:07.061
MATT: That hits.

01:48:07.061 --> 01:48:16.306
LIAM: So four. That's the dice before I add
anything. And then-- Does psychic damage get

01:48:16.306 --> 01:48:19.041
damage? It's a die. I don't know, I haven't done
it.

01:48:19.041 --> 01:48:20.427
LAURA: Doubled? You double all your dice.

01:48:20.427 --> 01:48:21.690
LIAM: All your dice.

01:48:21.690 --> 01:48:22.698
MATT: Yeah.

01:48:22.698 --> 01:48:23.835
LIAM: Okay.

01:48:23.835 --> 01:48:25.367
MATT: Was it a critical hit?

01:48:25.367 --> 01:48:26.364
LIAM: No. Sorry.

01:48:26.364 --> 01:48:27.715
MATT: Yeah, you don't double the dice.

01:48:27.715 --> 01:48:38.333
LIAM: Ten, and then. Don't message me, internet.
Ten, 14, 19, 'cause I don't care, 22, 27, 33, 34,

01:48:38.333 --> 01:48:48.863
37. Plus Hunter's Mark. 38, plus my plus eight to
the dagger is--

01:48:48.863 --> 01:48:50.286
LAURA: Wow.

01:48:50.286 --> 01:48:52.069
MATT: Rogues, man.

01:48:52.069 --> 01:48:53.597
LIAM: 42.

01:48:53.597 --> 01:48:55.362
MATT: 42. Nice.

01:48:55.362 --> 01:48:56.996
LIAM: And that's it.

01:48:56.996 --> 01:48:59.136
MATT: 42 points of impact. Are you staying back?

01:48:59.136 --> 01:49:01.403
LIAM: I'm out of movement, aren't I?

01:49:01.403 --> 01:49:02.833
MATT: I mean, you threw Whisper at it.

01:49:02.833 --> 01:49:05.445
LIAM: But the bonus action was for the Vow of
Enmity, I believe.

01:49:05.445 --> 01:49:07.650
MATT: Right. I'm saying, when you threw Whisper,
you weren't travelling with it.

01:49:07.650 --> 01:49:08.759
LIAM: No, no, no.

01:49:08.759 --> 01:49:10.685
MATT: Okay, good. Just making sure. That ends your
turn, Vax?

01:49:10.685 --> 01:49:11.596
LIAM: Yeah.

01:49:11.596 --> 01:49:12.888
MATT: Keyleth, you're up.

01:49:12.888 --> 01:49:17.763
MARISHA: Okay. So we have a giant bird, and
another giant bird, and they're all really angry

01:49:17.763 --> 01:49:19.209
at us, right?

01:49:19.209 --> 01:49:21.261
MATT: It's one giant bird, and then angry
wyverns.

01:49:21.261 --> 01:49:27.392
MARISHA: And then tiny, tiny dragons with wings.
Okay. Where's the wyvern?

01:49:27.392 --> 01:49:30.936
MATT: That's a wyvern there, and there's a wyvern
over there.

01:49:30.936 --> 01:49:35.227
LAURA: There's a wyvern, and there's a wyvern.

01:49:35.227 --> 01:49:37.709
MARISHA: (singing) Kill the wyvern, kill the
wyvern!

01:49:37.709 --> 01:49:39.817
ALL: (singing) Kill the wyvern!

01:49:39.817 --> 01:49:42.718
TALIESIN: We're a little weird tonight.

01:49:42.718 --> 01:49:47.216
MARISHA: That happened. Yeah, we kind of are,
aren't we?

01:49:47.216 --> 01:49:48.777
TALIESIN: This is a musical episode.

01:49:48.777 --> 01:49:50.383
MATT: I will fight you, Sam.

01:49:50.383 --> 01:49:56.379
MARISHA: Man, I'm going to go ahead and cast Call
Lightning, I guess?

01:49:56.379 --> 01:49:57.551
MATT: Okay!

01:49:57.551 --> 01:50:03.281
MARISHA: And I'm going to bring it down on the
wyvern that's fucking shit up next to Percy.

01:50:03.281 --> 01:50:09.764
MATT: All righty. So dexterity saving throw to
that wyvern right there?

01:50:09.764 --> 01:50:11.766
MARISHA: Yup, that's the daddy.

01:50:11.766 --> 01:50:15.380
MATT: That is a six! That is a very failed saving
throw. So that is--

01:50:15.380 --> 01:50:16.828
MARISHA: 3d10.

01:50:16.828 --> 01:50:18.245
MATT: Correct.

01:50:18.245 --> 01:50:24.514
MARISHA: That's not a great roll. Ten points of
lightning damage.

01:50:24.514 --> 01:50:29.368
MATT: Ten points of lightning damage to it. So, to
the wyvern, right?

01:50:29.368 --> 01:50:30.719
MARISHA: To the wyvern.

01:50:30.719 --> 01:50:35.162
MATT: Yeah. So the wyvern rider barely pulls out
of the way as the bolt of lightning from the

01:50:35.162 --> 01:50:40.618
slowly conjured storm in the sky strikes out and
slams into the back of the wyvern. You see the

01:50:40.618 --> 01:50:46.300
energy arcing through its body before it
dissipates, and the wyvern shakes from the impact,

01:50:46.300 --> 01:50:51.275
looks around angrily. The rider pulls the reins
and gets it refocused.

01:50:51.275 --> 01:50:58.023
MARISHA: Well, technically, doesn't Call
Lightning: every creature within five feet of that

01:50:58.023 --> 01:51:00.092
point must make a dexterity saving throw?

01:51:00.092 --> 01:51:02.960
MATT: It is every creature! Which the-- that's a
natural one.

01:51:02.960 --> 01:51:06.029
MARISHA: So he also takes the ten points of
damage.

01:51:06.029 --> 01:51:11.793
MATT: Yes. So, they both get hit. While he dodges,
the arcing energy actually travels through his

01:51:11.793 --> 01:51:15.070
body, grounding himself to the creature. So they
both take damage.

01:51:15.070 --> 01:51:28.146
MARISHA: And then I'm going to use my bonus action
to go-- let's go air elemental.

01:51:28.146 --> 01:51:35.557
LAURA: Looked like she was smelling her armpit as
she did that.

01:51:35.557 --> 01:51:37.454
MARISHA: (sniffs) Pit check is good!

01:51:37.454 --> 01:51:40.324
(laughter)

01:51:40.324 --> 01:51:41.553
TRAVIS: Kentucky.

01:51:41.553 --> 01:51:42.693
MATT: Perfect.

01:51:42.693 --> 01:51:44.006
(laughter)

01:51:44.006 --> 01:51:49.349
MATT: All righty. You are now an air elemental.
You can move in your elemental form. You haven't

01:51:49.349 --> 01:51:51.503
moved yet. So you can still move in your form if
you want.

01:51:51.503 --> 01:51:56.223
MARISHA: Can I levitate a little? Get in the air a
little bit?

01:51:56.223 --> 01:52:03.697
LAURA: It's fabulous in the air. It's really
good.

01:52:03.697 --> 01:52:09.697
MATT: You're ever-so-slightly levitating.

01:52:09.697 --> 01:52:11.207
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:52:11.207 --> 01:52:12.595
MATT: All right, there you go, Keyleth.

01:52:12.595 --> 01:52:13.736
MARISHA: Thanks, bruh.

01:52:13.736 --> 01:52:18.437
MATT: All right, now it's General (inaudible)'s
turn.

01:52:18.437 --> 01:52:20.901
TRAVIS: General what, did you say her name?

01:52:20.901 --> 01:52:23.365
MATT: I didn't. You don't know it.

01:52:23.365 --> 01:52:25.522
TRAVIS: Use your consonants, Mercer!

01:52:25.522 --> 01:52:27.238
SAM: General Grievous.

01:52:27.238 --> 01:52:29.592
MATT: I said too much. No. That would be so
hackneyed.

01:52:29.592 --> 01:52:34.384
TALIESIN: General Chaos. General Calamity?

01:52:34.384 --> 01:52:37.707
MATT: So, after taking the blow to the chest, is
going to go straight for you, Grog. You're a big

01:52:37.707 --> 01:52:41.815
old target who came forward and slammed and has
dealt a crapton of damage.

01:52:41.815 --> 01:52:43.645
TRAVIS: Be honest, she is attracted to me as
well.

01:52:43.645 --> 01:52:48.632
MATT: Probably. As she turns with the floating
hand and the floating sword, waving it by the

01:52:48.632 --> 01:52:54.784
hammer, watches as its ember-roc slams over
towards Percy and Pike. Feels pretty confident,

01:52:54.784 --> 01:53:00.312
sees you, a little more of a heartier target.
Points the hammer at you and says, "You will be my

01:53:00.312 --> 01:53:04.264
"charge tonight!" and starts walking to you.

01:53:04.264 --> 01:53:05.793
LAURA: No, no, no.

01:53:05.793 --> 01:53:09.252
ASHLEY: Get away from him. Get away from him!

01:53:09.252 --> 01:53:14.449
MATT: See if it recharges. It does not recharge
Flaming Anger, unfortunately, but will take two

01:53:14.449 --> 01:53:16.056
great maul attacks against you.

01:53:16.056 --> 01:53:17.359
TRAVIS: Okay.

01:53:17.359 --> 01:53:19.625
MARISHA: You're my charge. Yeah, boy.

01:53:19.625 --> 01:53:22.518
MATT: That is a 21 to hit.

01:53:22.518 --> 01:53:23.843
TRAVIS: It hits.

01:53:23.843 --> 01:53:25.260
MATT: And a 23 to hit.

01:53:25.260 --> 01:53:26.327
TRAVIS: That hits, too.

01:53:26.327 --> 01:53:40.949
MATT: All righty. So you take, for the first hit,
40 points of bludgeoning damage, reduced to half

01:53:40.949 --> 01:53:42.404
to 20.

01:53:42.404 --> 01:53:43.344
TRAVIS: Okay.

01:53:43.344 --> 01:53:46.404
MATT: And the second strike, not as good a roll.

01:53:46.404 --> 01:53:49.299
TRAVIS: Blinks with frustration.

01:53:49.299 --> 01:53:55.529
MATT: I know. 29 points of bludgeoning damage,
reduced to--

01:53:55.529 --> 01:53:56.985
TRAVIS: 14?

01:53:56.985 --> 01:54:03.286
MATT: 14. So brings the hammer back, right into
your shoulder, and it sends you off your feet. You

01:54:03.286 --> 01:54:07.274
catch yourself from the impact of the blow as the
hammer spins around and catches you in the other

01:54:07.274 --> 01:54:12.124
side, right at the solar plexus, almost knocking
the wind out of you. You feel your feet skid into

01:54:12.124 --> 01:54:17.405
the dry sand and dirt beneath your feet, and a
little smile curls in the corner of your face.

01:54:17.405 --> 01:54:22.202
TRAVIS: Ooh, Miss Piggy! That tickled. Can I use
Retaliation to give her what's good for?

01:54:22.202 --> 01:54:23.921
MATT: You've already used your reaction this
round.

01:54:23.921 --> 01:54:25.590
TRAVIS: Oh, you're right! I did! Damn it!

01:54:25.590 --> 01:54:26.615
MATT: Sorry.

01:54:26.615 --> 01:54:28.416
TRAVIS: Good call.

01:54:28.416 --> 01:54:35.843
MATT: But next turn I'm sure you'll be able to
give her what for. Percival, it's your turn. As

01:54:35.843 --> 01:54:40.232
you're standing there, the presence, the heat of
this creature near you, you immediately suffer

01:54:40.232 --> 01:54:46.198
four points of fire damage just from being in
the proximity of this entity.

01:54:46.198 --> 01:54:53.686
TALIESIN: Okay. I'm cool. I'm going to try and--
Okay, out of curiosity, is that little trebuchet

01:54:53.686 --> 01:54:56.000
there, is that more-or-less pointed at the wyvern
right now?

01:54:56.000 --> 01:55:02.048
MATT: More or less, you'd probably have to rotate
it a little bit. There is a large crank that has

01:55:02.048 --> 01:55:05.473
to be rotated to shift its direction.

01:55:05.473 --> 01:55:11.558
TALIESIN: I'm going to-- is it possible that I can
get this shot off in one round?

01:55:11.558 --> 01:55:17.566
MATT: It is possible, if you make a strength check
to get it to move to its place right now.

01:55:17.566 --> 01:55:27.834
TALIESIN: It's not like I've got a lot of options
here. Like, everything's going pretty iffy as it is.

01:55:27.834 --> 01:55:31.589
MATT: So you're ignoring the bird for now and
you're going for the trebuchet against the

01:55:31.589 --> 01:55:32.793
wyvern?

01:55:32.793 --> 01:55:36.137
TALIESIN: There's honestly not a lot I can do
about the bird right now.

01:55:36.137 --> 01:55:37.454
MATT: Okay.

01:55:37.454 --> 01:55:41.123
TALIESIN: If I try to run from the bird, is it
within striking distance of me?

01:55:41.123 --> 01:55:42.311
MATT: You don't know.

01:55:42.311 --> 01:55:48.726
TALIESIN: Okay. Well, hardly matters. All right.
Let's-- 'It Hardly Matters' is the name of the

01:55:48.726 --> 01:55:53.795
game. I'm going to see if I can get this-- I guess
I'm going to make a strength check to try and--

01:55:53.795 --> 01:55:55.334
MATT: Okay. Go for it.

01:55:55.334 --> 01:55:57.832
TALIESIN: Standard strength check?

01:55:57.832 --> 01:55:59.306
ASHLEY: Come on.

01:55:59.306 --> 01:56:00.835
LAURA: You can do it, Percy!

01:56:00.835 --> 01:56:02.337
MARISHA: The adrenaline kicks in! Oh!

01:56:02.337 --> 01:56:05.147
TALIESIN: Wait, wait, wait. I'm burning my
Resolve.

01:56:05.147 --> 01:56:07.881
MATT: That's saving throws.

01:56:07.881 --> 01:56:10.280
TALIESIN: Is it just saving throws? It's not--?

01:56:10.280 --> 01:56:12.938
MATT: It's only for saving throws, not for ability
checks.

01:56:12.938 --> 01:56:16.221
TALIESIN: Oh! Okay, so I'm not burning that, then.
Then that does not do anything.

01:56:16.221 --> 01:56:17.081
MATT: What did you roll?

01:56:17.081 --> 01:56:19.069
TALIESIN: I rolled a two. So I got a three.

01:56:19.069 --> 01:56:23.845
MATT: Yeah. You go and grab the ratchet and it's
stuck. It begins to shift a little bit. You're not

01:56:23.845 --> 01:56:26.677
sure if it's going to line up.

01:56:26.677 --> 01:56:30.566
TALIESIN: Then I'm going to jump over that thing
and run into the tent, 'cause I'm goddamn useless

01:56:30.566 --> 01:56:32.876
right now.

01:56:32.876 --> 01:56:35.352
MATT: Okay. You leap over and make your way inside
the tent.

01:56:35.352 --> 01:56:37.930
TALIESIN: Now I'm going to burn an Action Surge.

01:56:37.930 --> 01:56:43.406
MATT: As you rush away, the creature reaches out
with one of its claws and rakes towards your back.

01:56:43.568 --> 01:56:44.845
LIAM: He's keeping you humble tonight.

01:56:44.845 --> 01:56:47.426
MATT: It's going to be a 20 to hit.

01:56:47.426 --> 01:56:48.805
TALIESIN: That hits.

01:56:48.805 --> 01:56:54.922
MATT: Okay. The claw streaks across your back. You
feel the pain and the sudden rush of adrenaline

01:56:54.922 --> 01:57:04.065
hit you at the impact. That's going to be 14
points of slashing damage to your back.

01:57:04.065 --> 01:57:07.636
TALIESIN: Okay. I'm 64.

01:57:07.636 --> 01:57:09.898
ASHLEY: 64. Okay.

01:57:09.898 --> 01:57:13.311
MARISHA: Question.

01:57:13.311 --> 01:57:14.198
MATT: Yes?

01:57:14.198 --> 01:57:17.126
MARISHA: Are we inside the fort walls?

01:57:17.126 --> 01:57:19.972
MATT: You're inside the outer walls. This is the
actual front of the fort itself.

01:57:19.972 --> 01:57:23.487
MARISHA: We're inside the outer walls. So the ones
that were trying to go through that door were

01:57:23.487 --> 01:57:25.063
trying to get through the inner walls?

01:57:25.063 --> 01:57:28.450
MATT: Into the actual fortress itself. Yes.

01:57:28.450 --> 01:57:30.872
MARISHA: Okay. So we've gotten through one layer
of wall?

01:57:30.872 --> 01:57:31.529
MATT: Correct.

01:57:31.529 --> 01:57:33.363
MARISHA: And we're trying to get through the other
layer?

01:57:33.363 --> 01:57:35.037
LAURA: Well, they're trying to get through the
wall.

01:57:35.037 --> 01:57:37.024
MARISHA: Everyone seems to be. Just clarifying.
Continue.

01:57:37.024 --> 01:57:39.015
MATT: Yes. Percy. You said you're taking your
Action Surge?

01:57:39.015 --> 01:57:44.217
TALIESIN: I'm going to burn a bonus for a heal, so
I'm going to--

01:57:44.217 --> 01:57:45.635
MATT: Second Wind?

01:57:45.635 --> 01:57:53.827
TALIESIN: I'm going to burn a Second Wind, my only
Second Wind, and take 16 points back. And then I'm

01:57:53.827 --> 01:57:57.282
going to burn my Action Surge to try and fix the
Pepperbox. The Animus box.

01:57:57.282 --> 01:57:58.854
MATT: Okay.

01:57:58.854 --> 01:58:09.502
TALIESIN: Thankfully the difficulty is not
horrible. Okay. And that's fine! Again. So the

01:58:09.502 --> 01:58:11.197
Animus is back in action--

01:58:11.197 --> 01:58:16.606
MATT: Okay, as you duck inside, clear your mind
for a second, focus, pull out your tools with your

01:58:16.606 --> 01:58:20.592
Action Surge and quickly find the one section of
the barrel that had somehow sprung off and was

01:58:20.592 --> 01:58:25.842
loose. You click it back into place, look up, it
spins. Functional, clear and fine.

01:58:25.842 --> 01:58:28.340
LIAM: Did he blow on it like an NES cartridge?

01:58:28.340 --> 01:58:29.290
MATT and TALIESIN: Yeah!

01:58:29.290 --> 01:58:31.394
(laughter)

01:58:31.394 --> 01:58:37.454
TALIESIN: Boy! That took a lot. But I'm now hiding
in that tent. I'm definitely hiding in that as far

01:58:37.454 --> 01:58:39.345
back into that tent as I could have got.

01:58:39.345 --> 01:58:40.946
MATT: That ends your turn.

01:58:40.946 --> 01:58:43.012
(laughter)

01:58:43.012 --> 01:58:45.002
ASHLEY: Right at the door. Just in case.

01:58:45.002 --> 01:58:47.786
MARISHA: It's made of polyester. It's real bad.

01:58:47.786 --> 01:58:50.923
MATT: All right, that brings us to Scanlan. You're
up.

01:58:50.923 --> 01:58:57.238
SAM: I take a few steps towards Grog, if I can.
Over to my left a little bit, just so I could get

01:58:57.238 --> 01:59:05.929
a clear shot-- Sorry, other left. So I get a clear
shot on the fire giant. With Bigby's Hand, I'm

01:59:05.929 --> 01:59:11.250
going to do the Sugar Ray Leonard thing where it's
going round and round and round, but before he

01:59:11.250 --> 01:59:14.421
punches, I'm going to fire a Lightning Bolt at
it.

01:59:14.421 --> 01:59:20.816
MATT: Yes, not a problem. All right. That will--

01:59:20.816 --> 01:59:22.844
LIAM: So in love!

01:59:22.844 --> 01:59:28.819
MATT: It might singe a bit of the fur on the side
of your skivvies there, Grog, but a bolt of

01:59:28.819 --> 01:59:30.613
lightning coasts right past you.

01:59:30.613 --> 01:59:32.192
TRAVIS: Skivvies all right. Beard not so much.

01:59:32.192 --> 01:59:37.656
MATT: Yeah. Fair enough. This is a dexterity
saving throw. That is a 17 dex save. That does not

01:59:37.656 --> 01:59:40.301
make the DC, the giant gets full damage.

01:59:40.301 --> 01:59:41.994
SAM: 8d6.

01:59:41.994 --> 01:59:43.666
LAURA: Grog's poor ass.

01:59:43.666 --> 01:59:45.895
(laughter)

01:59:45.895 --> 01:59:47.779
LIAM: Grog, is that an extra mace over there?

01:59:47.779 --> 01:59:49.220
MARISHA: Oh, god.

01:59:49.220 --> 01:59:51.237
TRAVIS: Kashaw, somewhere, goes "Ah!"

01:59:51.237 --> 01:59:52.946
MARISHA: Gets a nosebleed.

01:59:52.946 --> 01:59:57.914
SAM: 24.

01:59:57.914 --> 02:00:07.181
MATT: 24. Okay, so you release the bolt of
lightning, and then just as the lightning hits the

02:00:07.181 --> 02:00:13.249
front of the giant's chest, as it was focusing on
Grog, it looks over and sees where the lightning

02:00:13.249 --> 02:00:17.681
bolt came from just as the (whack) across the
chin. Go ahead and roll a--

02:00:17.681 --> 02:00:23.205
SAM: So, the initial spell was level seven, but
subsequent actions--

02:00:23.205 --> 02:00:24.931
MATT: It maintains the level you cast it.

02:00:24.931 --> 02:00:28.114
SAM: Really? So it's another 8d8?

02:00:28.114 --> 02:00:31.276
MATT: Yeah, well, you have to roll to hit to see
if you hit it first.

02:00:31.276 --> 02:00:38.059
SAM: Okay. Oh yes, roll d20, right, this is a
spell attack. Whiffed.

02:00:38.059 --> 02:00:39.842
MARISHA: What'd you get?

02:00:39.842 --> 02:00:41.292
SAM: A natural one.

02:00:41.292 --> 02:00:42.953
ALL: Oh no!

02:00:42.953 --> 02:00:50.691
MATT: You watch as it swings towards the giant,
staring at you, at the last minute glances out and

02:00:50.691 --> 02:00:57.064
she sees the fist and ducks back, slow-motion
passes past her chin. As the jaw clenches, the

02:00:57.064 --> 02:01:01.522
teeth grinding underneath, you see the jagged
broken tops of the giant teeth as the eyes

02:01:01.522 --> 02:01:03.323
(whoosh) right back to you.

02:01:03.323 --> 02:01:07.573
SAM: Oh boy. That was less Sugar Ray Leonard and
more just, like, Sugar Ray.

02:01:07.573 --> 02:01:11.994
(laughter)

02:01:11.994 --> 02:01:14.195
MATT: I'm going to put Bigby's Hand on the other
side now for that.

02:01:14.195 --> 02:01:16.251
SAM: (singing) Every morning when I wake up.

02:01:16.251 --> 02:01:19.270
(laughter)

02:01:19.270 --> 02:01:22.084
ASHLEY: Oh my god.

02:01:22.084 --> 02:01:29.895
MATT: I almost want to give you inspiration for
that. Sure. Take back your bardic inspiration for

02:01:29.895 --> 02:01:31.233
that, sure.

02:01:31.233 --> 02:01:33.099
SAM: Oh! Great!

02:01:33.099 --> 02:01:38.307
MATT: Scanlan, you want to stay where you are or
you going to move? You still have ten more feet of

02:01:38.307 --> 02:01:39.716
movement if you want it.

02:01:39.716 --> 02:01:43.537
SAM: I mean, she's coming for me, so I'll just
back up ten feet.

02:01:43.537 --> 02:01:46.978
MATT: All right. There you go, all right.

02:01:46.978 --> 02:01:48.573
TALIESIN: Run!

02:01:48.573 --> 02:01:59.102
MATT: Now, darting from out from the side here,
Xanthas runs out, looks over the wall, sees you

02:01:59.102 --> 02:02:01.681
floating above. "Keep attacking your friends!"

02:02:01.681 --> 02:02:07.070
MARISHA: Fucking dick. Can we take him out? He was
always an asshole. Come on.

02:02:07.070 --> 02:02:10.176
LAURA: Obviously he's a bad guy. Obviously he's a
bad guy now.

02:02:10.176 --> 02:02:12.110
ASHLEY: Would you consider him a friend?

02:02:12.110 --> 02:02:14.880
MARISHA: He was always annoyed by us.

02:02:14.880 --> 02:02:17.495
LAURA: Oh yeah, do I like him so much now?

02:02:17.495 --> 02:02:19.081
MATT: Oh he's great.

02:02:19.081 --> 02:02:20.864
LAURA: He's my friend?

02:02:20.864 --> 02:02:26.087
MATT: Well, I mean-- You are considered charmed by
him, so yes.

02:02:26.087 --> 02:02:27.717
LAURA: He's my friend, cool.

02:02:27.717 --> 02:02:34.539
MATT: Yep. Seems like an ally at this point.
Focusing on that, keeping you informed--

02:02:34.539 --> 02:02:36.906
MARISHA: But Vex, he never had any redeeming
qualities.

02:02:36.906 --> 02:02:39.609
LAURA: I love him, he's my best friend.

02:02:39.609 --> 02:02:41.072
MARISHA: This is the first time we're hearing of
this!

02:02:41.072 --> 02:02:42.782
LAURA: Xanthas is my best friend forever!

02:02:42.782 --> 02:02:44.861
TALIESIN: You don't know him like she does.

02:02:44.861 --> 02:02:47.878
MARISHA: (chuckle) They spent a lot of time
together.

02:02:47.878 --> 02:02:57.732
MATT: Okay. Is going to look down and points his
finger across and a beam of reddish energy comes

02:02:57.732 --> 02:03:03.626
coursing to the ground and explodes right there in
the center of this area, actually right in the

02:03:03.626 --> 02:03:08.649
center with the fire elemental, so I need Grog,
Scanlan, and Keyleth to all make dexterity saving

02:03:08.649 --> 02:03:10.147
throws.

02:03:10.147 --> 02:03:11.204
TRAVIS: Cool!

02:03:11.204 --> 02:03:12.699
ASHLEY: This guy's the worst.

02:03:12.699 --> 02:03:14.245
TALIESIN: This is technically a magic--

02:03:14.245 --> 02:03:15.798
MATT: This is a Fireball.

02:03:15.798 --> 02:03:19.273
TRAVIS: (singing) Natural 20.

02:03:19.273 --> 02:03:22.928
MARISHA: Ouch, jeez, I rolled a two.

02:03:22.928 --> 02:03:25.029
SAM: Disadvantage on ability checks, not saves.

02:03:25.029 --> 02:03:26.319
MATT: Correct.

02:03:26.319 --> 02:03:27.464
SAM: 11.

02:03:27.464 --> 02:03:28.850
MARISHA: Seven.

02:03:28.850 --> 02:03:33.560
MATT: Okay, that's full damage to Keyleth and
Scanlan, half damage to Grog, as this is a

02:03:33.560 --> 02:03:37.244
5th-level Fireball.

02:03:37.244 --> 02:03:39.243
MARISHA: 5th-level Fireball?

02:03:39.243 --> 02:03:40.429
MATT: Yeah.

02:03:40.429 --> 02:03:41.882
MARISHA: Who did this?

02:03:41.882 --> 02:03:45.367
MATT: Little punk over here that was on top and
went down inside and came out the other side.

02:03:45.367 --> 02:03:47.002
MARISHA: Wait, is that Xanthas?

02:03:47.002 --> 02:03:48.447
MATT: Xanthas, yeah.

02:03:48.447 --> 02:03:51.147
TRAVIS: Does that break his--

02:03:51.147 --> 02:03:54.395
MATT: It's not concentration, no.

02:03:54.395 --> 02:03:57.116
TRAVIS: I know a lot about magic, you guys.

02:03:57.116 --> 02:04:03.908
MATT: 33 points of fire damage to Scanlan, 33
points of damage to Keyleth in her elemental form,

02:04:03.908 --> 02:04:05.648
and 15 points of fire damage to you, Grog.

02:04:05.648 --> 02:04:06.997
TRAVIS: Yay.

02:04:06.997 --> 02:04:12.242
MATT: And after firing, he ducks down to the side,
and he doesn't do much 'cause he still has partial

02:04:12.242 --> 02:04:15.486
cover while he's behind the top of that wall right
now.

02:04:15.486 --> 02:04:16.678
ASHLEY: He sucks!

02:04:16.678 --> 02:04:18.660
MARISHA: What a doucher.

02:04:18.660 --> 02:04:22.556
LAURA: I like him, you guys, I think he's great.

02:04:22.556 --> 02:04:27.577
MATT: That ends his turn. Pike, you're up. At the
beginning of your turn, due to the proximity of

02:04:27.577 --> 02:04:33.267
the heat of the bird behind you, the giant
ember-roc, you would take eight points of fire

02:04:33.267 --> 02:04:37.674
damage, but it's reduced to four because of your
armor's fire resistance. So that's four points of

02:04:37.674 --> 02:04:39.214
fire damage.

02:04:39.214 --> 02:04:41.328
ASHLEY: So, I have a quick question.

02:04:41.328 --> 02:04:42.469
MATT: Yes.

02:04:42.469 --> 02:04:48.208
ASHLEY: So the thing that Percy was trying to do
with the trebuchet. Did it not work because it

02:04:48.208 --> 02:04:49.241
wasn't--?

02:04:49.241 --> 02:04:50.535
TALIESIN: Because I'm weak.

02:04:50.535 --> 02:04:53.252
ASHLEY: You're weak, okay. I want to try and give
it a go.

02:04:53.252 --> 02:04:58.057
MATT: Okay. By the way, your sword should have
attacked last round when you summoned it, so go

02:04:58.057 --> 02:05:01.264
ahead and make a spell attack with it just because
I totally forgot about that.

02:05:01.264 --> 02:05:04.391
ASHLEY: Ugh, what do I roll?

02:05:04.391 --> 02:05:07.967
MATT: Just roll a d20 and add your spell attack
modifier. You're up next, Grog.

02:05:07.967 --> 02:05:10.796
ASHLEY: Ooh, 28!

02:05:10.796 --> 02:05:14.392
MATT: That hits! Go ahead and roll the damage for
your spiritual weapon.

02:05:14.392 --> 02:05:15.797
ASHLEY: 2d6?

02:05:15.797 --> 02:05:19.047
MATT: That is 1d8 plus five.

02:05:19.047 --> 02:05:24.042
ASHLEY: Eight.

02:05:24.042 --> 02:05:28.481
MATT: All right, so that's an additional eight
points of damage to the giant. Okay, so,

02:05:28.481 --> 02:05:29.908
continuing your turn--

02:05:29.908 --> 02:05:31.361
ASHLEY: Okay, so I'm going to try to--

02:05:31.361 --> 02:05:35.425
MATT: Winch it? All right, so as you see Percy run
off, you reach up, go ahead and make a strength

02:05:35.425 --> 02:05:36.402
check.

02:05:36.402 --> 02:05:37.826
ASHLEY: Okay.

02:05:37.826 --> 02:05:40.247
LAURA: You got it.

02:05:40.247 --> 02:05:43.899
ASHLEY: 12.

02:05:43.899 --> 02:05:45.311
MATT: 12? Okay, that's fine.

02:05:45.311 --> 02:05:46.627
(cheering)

02:05:46.627 --> 02:05:50.514
MATT: You grab it and (grunts) and it takes a
second, but you begin getting the winch to move

02:05:50.514 --> 02:05:53.249
around. As it does, does it begins to rotate. How
far are you rotating it? Who are you aiming it

02:05:53.249 --> 02:05:54.474
towards?

02:05:54.474 --> 02:05:56.528
ASHLEY: I'm going to point it right at the fire
bird.

02:05:56.528 --> 02:06:01.757
MATT: Okay. As you pull the winch around, and
there's a little trigger underneath as you get it

02:06:01.757 --> 02:06:05.124
in place that's kind of holding it.

02:06:05.124 --> 02:06:06.565
ASHLEY: (bink)

02:06:06.565 --> 02:06:18.973
MATT: As Pike (bink), the trebuchet, the sudden
momentum of the direct inertia to momentum, the

02:06:18.973 --> 02:06:29.026
device spins over top and lobs this large boulder
within this giant sling over and slamming right

02:06:29.026 --> 02:06:38.390
towards the face of the ember-roc. That's an 18.
Go ahead and roll 4d12 damage.

02:06:38.390 --> 02:06:42.444
SAM: Heavy duty. d12s!

02:06:42.444 --> 02:06:47.118
MATT: It's a siege weapon, man.

02:06:47.118 --> 02:06:49.902
LAURA: That's 4d12 right there.

02:06:49.902 --> 02:06:51.557
MATT: It's meant to destroy walls.

02:06:51.557 --> 02:06:53.369
SAM: Wow.

02:06:53.369 --> 02:07:02.965
ASHLEY: 27!

02:07:02.965 --> 02:07:08.554
MATT: 27 points of bludgeoning damage to the
ember-roc's face as it slams in, the rock breaks

02:07:08.554 --> 02:07:14.513
across its skull. And its head rears back from the
impact and it stumbles back a bit, shaking its

02:07:14.513 --> 02:07:20.598
head. You can see part of its beak is cracked now
from the impact. Blinking its eyes and shrieking.

02:07:20.598 --> 02:07:23.307
MARISHA: Oh, Buddy.

02:07:23.307 --> 02:07:26.743
MATT: No, it's trying to kill your friends.

02:07:26.743 --> 02:07:28.937
ASHLEY: Wait, aren't we attacking him?

02:07:28.937 --> 02:07:34.447
MATT: You can still move if you'd like, and you
have your bonus action to move your sword over if

02:07:34.447 --> 02:07:35.577
you'd like.

02:07:35.577 --> 02:07:40.362
ASHLEY: Okay, bonus action, is there only one
charge on that thing? Can I keep doing it, or no?

02:07:40.362 --> 02:07:41.683
MATT: Every round, it lasts for a minute.

02:07:41.683 --> 02:07:46.715
ASHLEY: Okay, I guess for my bonus action I'm
going to cast Shield of Faith on Percy.

02:07:46.715 --> 02:07:50.377
MATT: Okay, for the Spiritual Weapon, just so you
know--

02:07:50.377 --> 02:07:51.825
LAURA: I'll bet that's concentration.

02:07:51.825 --> 02:07:56.013
MATT: Well no, it's not concentration. But you can
choose to use your bonus action to have the sword

02:07:56.013 --> 02:07:58.522
attack, or cast a spell and the sword just does
nothing.

02:07:58.522 --> 02:08:01.230
ASHLEY: I guess it's not going to help you. I'm
going to use the spiritual weapon.

02:08:01.230 --> 02:08:04.052
MATT: Okay, so the bonus action is the sword
toward the giant, or the bird?

02:08:04.052 --> 02:08:05.132
ASHLEY: Toward the giant.

02:08:05.132 --> 02:08:09.457
MATT: The sword swings out of the way, arcs
through the air, roll another spell attack.

02:08:09.457 --> 02:08:14.862
ASHLEY: 16.

02:08:14.862 --> 02:08:16.417
MATT: 16 does not hit.

02:08:16.417 --> 02:08:18.475
ASHLEY: I'm going to use Guided Strike to add
ten.

02:08:18.475 --> 02:08:19.682
MATT: Okay!

02:08:19.682 --> 02:08:22.230
ASHLEY: Oh but no, I don't want to, is it too late
to retract that?

02:08:22.230 --> 02:08:24.008
MATT: If you want to.

02:08:24.008 --> 02:08:25.884
ASHLEY: I wanted to use that for something bigger.

02:08:25.884 --> 02:08:28.195
TRAVIS: Something bigger than the fire giant?

02:08:28.195 --> 02:08:30.728
LAURA: Something bigger than the spiritual
weapon.

02:08:30.728 --> 02:08:32.156
ASHLEY: It's not going to do that much damage.

02:08:32.156 --> 02:08:33.681
TALIESIN: Yeah, something that does more damage
than the spiritual weapon.

02:08:33.681 --> 02:08:37.365
MATT: Yeah, I mean you don't have to, it's up to
you.

02:08:37.365 --> 02:08:39.543
ASHLEY: No, it's okay. I'll wait for something
bigger.

02:08:39.543 --> 02:08:42.440
MATT: Okay so the blade arcs over and slams into
the armor of the giant and the giant kind of

02:08:42.440 --> 02:08:48.500
shrugs it off. No damage. You just couldn't quite
impact against the creature's flesh. You still can

02:08:48.500 --> 02:08:50.044
move if you want to.

02:08:50.044 --> 02:08:52.332
ASHLEY: I'm going to stay.

02:08:52.332 --> 02:08:53.730
MATT: You're going to stay there?

02:08:53.730 --> 02:08:54.835
ASHLEY: Yeah.

02:08:54.835 --> 02:08:58.297
MATT: Okay. The trebuchet is expended, by the way,
it would have to be loaded. And to load that

02:08:58.297 --> 02:09:01.483
thing, it takes quite a few people. Just so you're
aware it's probably not going to be useful again

02:09:01.483 --> 02:09:02.681
in this battle.

02:09:02.681 --> 02:09:04.232
There are other weapons in the field.

02:09:04.232 --> 02:09:06.203
LIAM: Everybody to the trebuchet.

02:09:06.203 --> 02:09:08.691
MARISHA: All hands on deck!

02:09:08.691 --> 02:09:13.547
MATT: Heave ho! All right, Pike, that ends your
turn?

02:09:13.547 --> 02:09:19.369
ASHLEY: Well, I'll move out a little bit then, I
didn't know it would take so much. Towards the

02:09:19.369 --> 02:09:20.612
giant.

02:09:20.612 --> 02:09:22.056
MATT: Okay.

02:09:22.056 --> 02:09:23.836
ASHLEY: I don't know why!

02:09:23.836 --> 02:09:25.646
MATT: That's about as far as you can get there.

02:09:25.646 --> 02:09:27.688
ASHLEY: All right!

02:09:27.688 --> 02:09:30.733
MATT: Staying in melee range of the creature or do
you want to leave its melee range? It will get a

02:09:30.733 --> 02:09:35.009
strike at you if you do. Actually, it will not
because it already stuck at Percy so you can go

02:09:35.009 --> 02:09:38.545
there, you're fine. All right, that ends your
turn. Grog, you're up.

02:09:38.545 --> 02:09:45.106
TRAVIS: I see the giant eyeing Scanlan and I'm
like: I thought you said I was your charge. You

02:09:45.106 --> 02:09:51.515
are not cheating on me this early in our
relationship. And I take both of my attacks at

02:09:51.515 --> 02:09:58.661
general hot fire giant's face. Reckless. Great
Weapon Master.

02:09:58.661 --> 02:10:00.518
MATT: Go for it.

02:10:00.518 --> 02:10:07.293
TRAVIS: 30 minus five is 25!

02:10:07.293 --> 02:10:09.117
MATT: Hits.

02:10:09.117 --> 02:10:14.552
TRAVIS: 26 minus five is 21?

02:10:14.552 --> 02:10:15.719
MATT: Hits.

02:10:15.719 --> 02:10:17.439
TRAVIS: Awesome!

02:10:17.439 --> 02:10:36.215
34 for the first one, with six points of
necrotic. 41.

02:10:36.215 --> 02:10:40.465
MATT: 41 points of damage on that one.

02:10:40.465 --> 02:10:42.877
TRAVIS: I rolled a d12 plus 13.

02:10:42.877 --> 02:10:46.501
MATT: Oh, a straight 12 on that one? Oh, that's
nasty. All right. You still have your bonus

02:10:46.501 --> 02:10:47.565
action.

02:10:47.565 --> 02:10:49.780
TRAVIS: I do! I would like to hit him again!

02:10:49.780 --> 02:10:51.206
MATT: Okay.

02:10:51.206 --> 02:10:57.546
TRAVIS: Not that great. 21.

02:10:57.546 --> 02:10:59.528
MATT: That hits.

02:10:59.528 --> 02:11:09.664
TRAVIS: 26, with five points of necrotic.

02:11:09.664 --> 02:11:11.866
MATT: 26 points of damage.

02:11:11.866 --> 02:11:13.475
ASHLEY: Jeez.

02:11:13.475 --> 02:11:16.727
MARISHA: Let's take this bird down.

02:11:16.727 --> 02:11:19.989
MATT: You did over 100 points of damage in one
round of combat.

02:11:19.989 --> 02:11:21.825
ALL: What?!

02:11:21.825 --> 02:11:25.669
ASHLEY: That's so much, Grog.

02:11:25.833 --> 02:11:29.420
TRAVIS: Look, I am a one-fire-giant kind of guy. I
get very upset about these things.

02:11:29.420 --> 02:11:32.881
MATT: So with Bigby's Hand floating on one side
and a glowing sword on the other, the giant

02:11:32.881 --> 02:11:40.700
focusing on Scanlan, you get angry and just
release this torrent of strikes. Pulling back,

02:11:40.700 --> 02:11:45.740
from the blade you can see dark blood begin to
pour from the plates and the giant is wounded, but

02:11:45.740 --> 02:11:48.268
it's grinning. And its attention swings back to
you.

02:11:48.268 --> 02:11:50.503
TRAVIS: I told you I was worth a date.

02:11:50.503 --> 02:11:52.680
MATT: All right, that ends your turn, Grog?

02:11:52.680 --> 02:11:54.099
TRAVIS: Yeah. That's it.

02:11:54.099 --> 02:12:01.378
MATT: All right. The bird, who has watched Pike
run past, after being slammed in the face by the

02:12:01.378 --> 02:12:07.124
trebuchet, angrily steps forward here. First let's
see if it regenerates that. It does recover its

02:12:07.124 --> 02:12:15.782
inferno ability, however, it is going to unleash a
bite and two claw attacks on you. That is a

02:12:15.782 --> 02:12:18.255
natural 20 on the bite.

02:12:18.255 --> 02:12:19.964
TRAVIS: No, Pike!

02:12:20.136 --> 02:12:21.920
MATT: That is a 19 to hit on the first claw
attack.

02:12:21.920 --> 02:12:23.329
ASHLEY: No.

02:12:23.329 --> 02:12:26.936
MATT: And that is a 23 to hit. So a bite and a
claw attack. The bite is a critical,

02:12:26.936 --> 02:12:47.749
unfortunately. So as that one comes to strike you,
that is 19 plus 2d8 fire damage. So you take 30

02:12:47.749 --> 02:12:49.590
points of slashing damage.

02:12:49.590 --> 02:12:51.186
ASHLEY: Okay.

02:12:51.186 --> 02:12:57.585
MATT: Plus ten points of fire damage reduced to
half, so five. Actually, it would have been 20, so

02:12:57.585 --> 02:12:59.478
that's ten points of fire damage.

02:12:59.478 --> 02:13:02.884
ASHLEY: I have resistance to fire.

02:13:02.884 --> 02:13:06.330
MATT: Right, it would have been 20.

02:13:06.330 --> 02:13:07.663
TRAVIS: Okay.

02:13:07.663 --> 02:13:09.504
LAURA: But then, because he did a melee attack on
you.

02:13:09.504 --> 02:13:14.200
ASHLEY: Yeah, he did a melee attack so the
attacker suffers 2d6.

02:13:14.200 --> 02:13:17.429
MATT: Is that fire damage?

02:13:17.429 --> 02:13:18.757
ASHLEY: Yeah.

02:13:18.757 --> 02:13:20.890
MATT: You watch as there's a burst of flame but it
seems to have no affect on the creature.

02:13:20.890 --> 02:13:22.198
ASHLEY: Okay.

02:13:22.198 --> 02:13:26.503
MATT: This creature is fire by nature.

02:13:26.503 --> 02:13:28.326
TRAVIS: Naughty by nature?

02:13:28.326 --> 02:13:35.981
MATT: Possibly. All right, and it's going to begin
flanking around you.

02:13:35.981 --> 02:13:38.004
LAURA: Damn it.

02:13:38.004 --> 02:13:44.455
MATT: After it does its strikes it-- (stomps).
That brings us to the top of the round. Now, this

02:13:44.455 --> 02:13:52.030
guy is going to spend his turn loading up and then
taking another shot at the bird there. That one

02:13:52.030 --> 02:13:58.810
unfortunately goes wide. It fires and slams into
the ground and a big cloud of dust and rock gets

02:13:58.810 --> 02:14:06.925
thrown into the air as the large bolt jettisons
into the floor, wasted shot there. This wyvern

02:14:06.925 --> 02:14:11.081
over here is going to fly up.

02:14:11.081 --> 02:14:12.832
LAURA: And attack me!

02:14:12.832 --> 02:14:15.626
MATT: No, he's going to go after Keyleth, the air
elemental form there.

02:14:15.626 --> 02:14:17.084
MARISHA: Bring it.

02:14:17.084 --> 02:14:23.564
MATT: This wyvern here is going to rush over to
Scanlan. And these guys are going to rush in and

02:14:23.564 --> 02:14:25.173
try and aid Scanlan against this.

02:14:25.173 --> 02:14:27.474
MARISHA: Hoping to get hit. Hit me, come on, hit
me!

02:14:27.474 --> 02:14:31.783
MATT: So we have the wyvern against you,
Keyleth.

02:14:31.783 --> 02:14:34.276
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:14:34.276 --> 02:14:36.309
MATT: Bite attack is a two! No, that is not going
to hit.

02:14:36.309 --> 02:14:37.689
MARISHA: Negatory.

02:14:37.689 --> 02:14:40.957
MATT: The stinger is going to be an 18 to hit.

02:14:40.957 --> 02:14:41.815
MARISHA: Oh yeah.

02:14:41.815 --> 02:14:47.171
MATT: So you take 11 points of piercing damage.
Are you immune to poison?

02:14:47.171 --> 02:14:50.949
MARISHA: Huh? No, I'm immune to poison. Elemental.

02:14:50.949 --> 02:14:54.126
MATT: That's what I figured. So you just take 11
points of piercing damage from that strike.

02:14:54.126 --> 02:14:56.574
MARISHA: I'm good. I'm good.

02:14:56.574 --> 02:15:00.546
MATT: The other wyvern is going to swing down. I
forgot, the wyvern rider is going to take an

02:15:00.546 --> 02:15:01.925
attack at you.

02:15:01.925 --> 02:15:03.073
SAM: Oh shit.

02:15:03.073 --> 02:15:07.331
MATT: I forgot, he's on there too. He swings down
with his giant club. That's going to be a 21 to hit.

02:15:07.331 --> 02:15:08.525
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:15:08.525 --> 02:15:18.711
MATT: You suffer nine points of bludgeoning damage
from the wyvern rider. You Scanlan, the wyvern is

02:15:18.711 --> 02:15:21.653
going to strike at you with both its bite and
its--

02:15:21.653 --> 02:15:24.386
SAM: I would like to Cutting Words the first one.

02:15:24.386 --> 02:15:29.528
MATT: Okay. You can decide whether or not to
Cutting Words, I'm just giving you this because

02:15:29.528 --> 02:15:32.967
you've seen them fight. The bite is painful, the
stinger is where the poison is.

02:15:32.967 --> 02:15:34.603
SAM: I'll save it for that one.

02:15:34.603 --> 02:15:36.066
MATT: Save it for that one, if you're going to.

02:15:36.066 --> 02:15:37.018
SAM: Sure.

02:15:37.018 --> 02:15:38.558
MATT: But that was a 23 to hit.

02:15:38.558 --> 02:15:39.707
SAM: That hits.

02:15:39.707 --> 02:15:41.449
MATT: And the stinger is a 21.

02:15:41.449 --> 02:15:45.046
SAM: Well, I Cutting Words that one.

02:15:45.046 --> 02:15:46.502
MATT: Okay.

02:15:46.502 --> 02:15:55.808
SAM: So I'll sing at it: (singing) I don't want to
die! Get your wings off me baby, get your wings

02:15:55.808 --> 02:16:09.072
off me baby. I don't want to die. All around the
world! Only a seven.

02:16:09.072 --> 02:16:12.679
MATT: 21 minus seven is 14.

02:16:12.679 --> 02:16:14.233
SAM: That's my AC.

02:16:14.233 --> 02:16:16.032
MATT: Ooh.

02:16:16.032 --> 02:16:18.325
LIAM: You're being punished for using that song.

02:16:18.325 --> 02:16:26.915
MATT: Yeah. So you take 11 points of piercing
damage for the bite. And you take 11 points of

02:16:27.027 --> 02:16:29.953
piercing damage from the stinger, and I need you
to make a constitution saving throw.

02:16:29.953 --> 02:16:32.845
SAM: No problem.

02:16:32.845 --> 02:16:34.458
TALIESIN: High.

02:16:34.458 --> 02:16:37.653
SAM: High. Constitution?

02:16:37.653 --> 02:16:38.780
MATT: Yes.

02:16:38.780 --> 02:16:40.071
SAM: 18.

02:16:40.071 --> 02:16:45.027
MATT: 18? Okay. You manage to-- you take 12 points
of poison damage.

02:16:45.027 --> 02:16:49.567
SAM: In addition to what you already said, 11 and
11? So 12 more.

02:16:49.567 --> 02:16:54.575
MATT: Correct. And I need you to make constitution
saving throws for each of those for your

02:16:54.575 --> 02:16:58.410
concentration. You have advantage on these.
Because of your Warcaster feat.

02:16:58.410 --> 02:17:00.357
SAM: So wait, that's two concentration rolls?

02:17:00.357 --> 02:17:02.735
MATT: Yeah, advantage on the-- you make two of
them, yeah.

02:17:02.735 --> 02:17:08.003
SAM: 17 plus something.

02:17:08.003 --> 02:17:09.974
MATT: Yeah, you're fine. Next one with advantage.

02:17:09.974 --> 02:17:14.175
SAM: Natural 20. Two natural 20's!

02:17:14.175 --> 02:17:21.259
MATT: All righty, and the wyvern rider is going to
take a swing at you.

02:17:21.259 --> 02:17:22.523
SAM: Sure, sure.

02:17:22.523 --> 02:17:23.774
MATT: That is a 22.

02:17:23.774 --> 02:17:25.304
SAM: Yeah, it hits.

02:17:25.304 --> 02:17:30.595
MATT: You take nine points of bludgeoning damage
as it smacks you over the head with a giant club.

02:17:30.595 --> 02:17:31.727
ASHLEY: Are you okay!?

02:17:31.727 --> 02:17:33.561
MATT: I need you to make another constitution
saving throw with advantage.

02:17:33.561 --> 02:17:34.775
LAURA: Oh my god.

02:17:34.775 --> 02:17:36.736
MATT: Because you're being hacked like crazy here.

02:17:36.736 --> 02:17:38.465
SAM: Another natural 20.

02:17:38.465 --> 02:17:39.764
ASHLEY: Shut the fuck up.

02:17:39.764 --> 02:17:41.844
SAM: The other one was a three. Three and a 20.

02:17:41.844 --> 02:17:49.392
MATT: There you go. Warcaster, man. Warcaster is a
great feat. All right, that ends their turn, it is

02:17:49.392 --> 02:17:51.463
now Vex's turn.

02:17:51.463 --> 02:17:53.852
LAURA: Yes, can I attack my best buddy?

02:17:53.852 --> 02:17:55.895
LIAM: Who is that?

02:17:55.895 --> 02:17:58.283
LAURA: Xanthas. He's my best friend.

02:17:58.283 --> 02:18:03.014
MATT: It's more of a telepathic thing.

02:18:03.014 --> 02:18:04.314
LAURA: Motherfuck!

02:18:04.314 --> 02:18:05.597
MATT: You know what he's referring to.

02:18:05.597 --> 02:18:07.003
TRAVIS: Have you been writing his name and your
name in your notebook?

02:18:07.003 --> 02:18:08.421
LAURA: With hearts around it and everything.

02:18:08.421 --> 02:18:18.823
MATT: You are such a lawyer. No, for this you're
going to keep taking shots at Grog.

02:18:18.823 --> 02:18:21.133
LAURA: Fine!

02:18:21.133 --> 02:18:25.077
TRAVIS: Now, there are lots of people to choose
from. She doesn't have to pick the most handsome.

02:18:25.077 --> 02:18:29.045
LAURA: Hey Grog, what's your AC?

02:18:29.045 --> 02:18:30.591
TRAVIS: Why, what did you do?

02:18:30.591 --> 02:18:33.241
LAURA: Because I got a 26 and a 29.

02:18:33.241 --> 02:18:37.330
MATT: Yeah, you get hit. And the first one gets
sneak attack damage because technically you're

02:18:37.330 --> 02:18:39.067
working on--

02:18:39.067 --> 02:18:40.651
LAURA: You!

02:18:40.651 --> 02:18:42.267
LIAM: She just Boromir'd your ass.

02:18:42.267 --> 02:18:47.275
MARISHA: Oh no! Not Boromir!

02:18:47.275 --> 02:18:50.335
ASHLEY: Oh, are we going to die?

02:18:50.335 --> 02:18:51.490
TRAVIS: Nope.

02:18:51.490 --> 02:18:53.345
MARISHA: Boromir was my favorite.

02:18:53.345 --> 02:18:55.786
ASHLEY: Scanlan, run in the tent.

02:18:55.786 --> 02:18:57.070
LAURA: 17.

02:18:57.070 --> 02:18:58.416
TRAVIS: What, damage?

02:18:58.416 --> 02:18:59.523
LAURA: Piercing damage.

02:18:59.523 --> 02:19:00.662
MATT: With the sneak attack?

02:19:00.662 --> 02:19:03.182
LAURA: Halved. Huh? Yeah, that's with the sneak
attack.

02:19:03.182 --> 02:19:06.189
MATT: Okay, so half of that it puts you at eight
points of piercing damage.

02:19:06.189 --> 02:19:08.571
LAURA: And then, oh, four lightning damage.

02:19:08.571 --> 02:19:11.395
TRAVIS: So four total.

02:19:11.395 --> 02:19:17.250
LAURA: Oh, that's just the first attack! Oh no!
I'm sorry!

02:19:17.250 --> 02:19:24.074
TALIESIN: Has no one noticed that she's doing this
yet, by the way? No one has commented that she's

02:19:24.074 --> 02:19:25.157
doing this.

02:19:25.157 --> 02:19:26.668
TRAVIS: Well, now I'm going to catch on.

02:19:26.668 --> 02:19:28.531
LAURA: 20 on the second attack.

02:19:28.531 --> 02:19:29.858
MATT: So ten.

02:19:29.858 --> 02:19:32.376
LAURA: So ten damage on the second plus three
lightning.

02:19:32.376 --> 02:19:33.842
MATT: Okay, so 13.

02:19:33.842 --> 02:19:38.555
TRAVIS: 25. I'm keeping track of this.

02:19:38.555 --> 02:19:39.798
LAURA: Oh shit.

02:19:39.798 --> 02:19:41.160
MATT: Okay.

02:19:41.160 --> 02:19:49.641
LAURA: (singing) I'm going to go because we don't
get a break because we're fighting.

02:19:49.641 --> 02:19:53.936
LIAM: And stay down!

02:19:53.936 --> 02:19:55.298
MATT: Okay Vax, you're up.

02:19:55.298 --> 02:20:02.997
LIAM: All right, I want to a little mini curve and
go two squares this way and on the way I want to

02:20:02.997 --> 02:20:06.538
throw, as a bonus action, throw my Flametongue
Dagger at my sister.

02:20:06.538 --> 02:20:07.962
MATT: Okay.

02:20:07.962 --> 02:20:18.948
LIAM: Yeah, so here we go. That hits, that's a 29.
So she takes a total of seven points of damage.

02:20:18.948 --> 02:20:21.878
MATT: Okay, go ahead and mark that on her sheet
for her.

02:20:21.878 --> 02:20:30.326
LIAM: Okay. Minus seven awesome points. And then I
want to walk up to the back of the giantess and

02:20:30.326 --> 02:20:32.487
stab her in the calf.

02:20:32.487 --> 02:20:33.822
MATT: Okay.

02:20:33.822 --> 02:20:36.514
TALIESIN: She has a small cow?

02:20:36.514 --> 02:20:38.822
LIAM: A natural 20.

02:20:38.822 --> 02:20:41.884
MATT: Go ahead and roll damage on that.

02:20:41.884 --> 02:20:43.277
TALIESIN: Wait, is that with sneak attack?

02:20:43.277 --> 02:20:44.372
MATT: Yeah.

02:20:44.372 --> 02:20:45.940
TALIESIN: Ooh! What! What?!

02:20:45.940 --> 02:20:48.490
SAM: It's going to be like a million points of
damage.

02:20:48.490 --> 02:20:52.612
TALIESIN: You're going to carve a Christmas animal
out of her.

02:20:52.612 --> 02:20:54.366
LIAM: There are no numbers as high.

02:20:54.366 --> 02:20:58.656
MARISHA: Yes. Get it. Get it! Big money, no
whammies!

02:20:58.656 --> 02:21:03.933
SAM: This is a fun game.

02:21:03.933 --> 02:21:07.404
MARISHA: This is great.

02:21:07.404 --> 02:21:10.776
ASHLEY: I love Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons.

02:21:10.776 --> 02:21:15.246
MARISHA: We don't know the damage on the inside
yet, but this is fine.

02:21:15.246 --> 02:21:23.553
LIAM: Plus Hunter's Mark. Shit.

02:21:23.553 --> 02:21:25.397
MATT: Which is also doubled, technically.

02:21:25.397 --> 02:21:32.661
LIAM: Yeah I know. Did I-- yes I did. I forgot
just my straight-up bonus that doesn't get

02:21:32.661 --> 02:21:39.596
doubled. That is 64 points of damage.

02:21:39.596 --> 02:21:44.400
MATT: How do you want to do this?

02:21:44.400 --> 02:21:46.950
(cheering)

02:21:46.950 --> 02:21:48.278
TRAVIS: Yeah!

02:21:48.278 --> 02:21:49.235
ASHLEY: Kill it!

02:21:49.235 --> 02:21:50.206
MARISHA: Kill it!

02:21:50.206 --> 02:21:55.512
LIAM: I want to to walk up and jab Whisper into
the back of her calf and then slide it up the back

02:21:55.512 --> 02:22:01.173
of her leg, up the ass, up the small of her back
as high as I can reach. Probably around the

02:22:01.173 --> 02:22:03.215
tailbone, I don't know.

02:22:03.215 --> 02:22:09.050
MATT: Okay, as you jam it into the back of the
calf, the armor plates give way to the impact of

02:22:09.050 --> 02:22:14.909
the blow. And she looks over her shoulder and
tries to swing the maul out backwards. You're too

02:22:14.909 --> 02:22:20.959
low at this point as she pulls backwards, exposes
further up and you just drive the blade upward. As

02:22:20.959 --> 02:22:27.484
you do you catch some sort of heavy vein as blood
begins to just gout out of the wound. And you keep

02:22:27.484 --> 02:22:32.358
pushing upward, it won't go much past the thigh at
this point, but she turns around and starts going

02:22:32.358 --> 02:22:41.794
unconscious from the rapid blood loss based on the
wounds she's already sustained. She takes her

02:22:41.794 --> 02:22:47.672
hammer up to deliver a death blow down upon you
and as she goes to reach for you, her fingers lack

02:22:47.672 --> 02:22:53.430
the strength to hold the blade and she tumbles
forward. You pass to the side, sidestepping as her

02:22:53.430 --> 02:22:59.923
form slams into the dirt, knocking up dust around
her on the ground.

02:22:59.923 --> 02:23:01.895
(air horn)

02:23:01.895 --> 02:23:04.891
(laughter)

02:23:04.891 --> 02:23:11.747
MATT: Vex, I need you to go ahead and roll a
wisdom saving throw.

02:23:11.747 --> 02:23:13.656
LIAM: Because I stabbed you.

02:23:13.656 --> 02:23:23.113
LAURA: Roll low, roll low! Oh, I mean roll high!
Roll high! Wisdom saving throw. 15.

02:23:23.113 --> 02:23:28.781
MATT: 15 does not make it. However, technically,
and this was my fault before, you do have

02:23:28.781 --> 02:23:34.422
advantage because it is a person who is not your
ally. Or they're fighting your allies.

02:23:34.422 --> 02:23:36.557
LAURA: That's even worse.

02:23:36.557 --> 02:23:40.025
MATT: Yep, so you're still dominated. Sorry.

02:23:40.025 --> 02:23:43.447
LIAM: But at least you lost some hit points.

02:23:43.447 --> 02:23:44.588
LAURA: Yay...

02:23:44.588 --> 02:23:45.622
LIAM: Seven.

02:23:45.622 --> 02:23:46.853
LAURA: I saw.

02:23:46.853 --> 02:23:50.061
MATT: All right. So that ends Vax's turn, Keyleth,
you're up.

02:23:50.061 --> 02:23:54.097
MARISHA: Okay so, I have the wyvern in my face?

02:23:54.097 --> 02:23:56.639
MATT: You do, yes. And the wyvern rider.

02:23:56.639 --> 02:23:59.912
MARISHA: And the wyvern rider? I'm going to do two
slam attacks.

02:23:59.912 --> 02:24:01.903
MATT: To the wyvern or the rider?

02:24:01.903 --> 02:24:03.661
MARISHA: What looks worse?

02:24:03.661 --> 02:24:05.411
MATT: The wyvern.

02:24:05.411 --> 02:24:06.920
MARISHA: The wyvern, then.

02:24:06.920 --> 02:24:08.636
MATT: The wyvern rider hasn't really been hurt.

02:24:08.636 --> 02:24:09.817
MARISHA: I'm going to take out the wyvern.

02:24:09.817 --> 02:24:11.548
MATT: Okay go for it, roll two strikes.

02:24:11.548 --> 02:24:23.113
MARISHA: Okay. Okay, what am I adding? Hang on.
Sorry, I'm the worst. Oh, plus five, okay so the

02:24:23.113 --> 02:24:25.749
first one is 18.

02:24:25.749 --> 02:24:27.463
MATT: 18? Hits.

02:24:27.463 --> 02:24:32.580
MARISHA: And the second one is not as good. That's
a 14.

02:24:32.580 --> 02:24:34.668
MATT: 14 also hits.

02:24:34.668 --> 02:24:35.814
MARISHA: Really?

02:24:35.814 --> 02:24:37.272
MATT: They don't have a high armor class.

02:24:37.272 --> 02:24:39.108
MARISHA: Aw, so they each take...

02:24:39.108 --> 02:24:41.648
MATT: They've got a fair amount of hit points for
their size, but their armor class isn't huge.

02:24:41.648 --> 02:24:50.914
MARISHA: Okay cool, so the first one is good. 13
plus five so 18 for the first hit.

02:24:50.914 --> 02:24:52.501
MATT: Okay.

02:24:52.501 --> 02:24:59.945
MARISHA: And four plus three is seven plus five is
12. 12 for the second.

02:24:59.945 --> 02:25:02.741
MATT: Gotcha. All right.

02:25:02.741 --> 02:25:07.691
MARISHA: And then I'm going to use a bonus action.
I have never done this before. I'm going to use a

02:25:07.691 --> 02:25:17.042
bonus action, as a Circle of the Moon druid, to
use one spell slot to heal 1d8 hit points.

02:25:17.042 --> 02:25:19.073
MATT: Okay, go for it.

02:25:19.073 --> 02:25:20.414
MARISHA: Ooh, seven! That's good!

02:25:20.414 --> 02:25:23.841
MATT: All righty. So, as you slam the wyvern
twice, whack! Whack! You can see it's being

02:25:23.841 --> 02:25:28.335
buffeted. The wings are trying to keep up from the
sheer amount of wind that's swirling around it. The

02:25:28.335 --> 02:25:33.454
blows are almost knocking the rider off, and he's
spent most of his round trying to hold on to it.

02:25:33.454 --> 02:25:36.973
It's looking pretty rough. It's barely keeping
itself up in the air, but it's still standing in

02:25:36.973 --> 02:25:38.215
front of you.

02:25:38.215 --> 02:25:39.535
MARISHA: Awesome.

02:25:39.535 --> 02:25:42.507
MATT: All right. That ends your turn, Keyleth? All
right.

02:25:42.507 --> 02:25:44.827
MARISHA: I'm going to keep him locked down.

02:25:44.827 --> 02:25:51.004
MATT: Okay. It is not the general's turn, because
the general is currently dead. Percival.

02:25:51.004 --> 02:25:58.298
TALIESIN: I'm going to peek out the tent, just one
step. I can see that the wyvern-- I take a look at

02:25:58.298 --> 02:25:59.960
the field and I see that--

02:25:59.960 --> 02:26:03.869
MARISHA: Sorry, sorry! Sorry, Jesus!

02:26:03.869 --> 02:26:10.956
TALIESIN: Okay, so that's happening, but I can see
that we have a problem with Scanlan. So I'm going

02:26:10.956 --> 02:26:17.131
to take some shots at the creatures that are
attacking Scanlan. I'm going to attack the wyvern,

02:26:17.131 --> 02:26:18.229
not the rider.

02:26:18.229 --> 02:26:19.545
MATT: Okay.

02:26:19.545 --> 02:26:24.635
TALIESIN: First shot-- actually, you know what? I
haven't tried this yet, and this could be fun. I'm

02:26:24.635 --> 02:26:27.980
going to try a piercing shot and see if I can hit
the rider and the wyvern.

02:26:27.980 --> 02:26:31.318
MATT: I will say that yes, you can, because they
occupy the same space.

02:26:31.318 --> 02:26:38.742
TALIESIN: So, starting with the wyvern, and then--
all right. Come on, don't be an asshole. Eh,

02:26:38.742 --> 02:26:41.327
that's not terrible. 19?

02:26:41.327 --> 02:26:44.148
MATT: 19 hits. So roll also for the--

02:26:44.148 --> 02:26:50.568
TALIESIN: Oh, for the rider? That's 25.

02:26:50.568 --> 02:26:57.177
MATT: Also hits, so with a single shot, it shoots
through the neck and actually pierces the shoulder

02:26:57.177 --> 02:26:59.486
of the rider at the same time.

02:26:59.486 --> 02:27:01.168
LAURA: That's sick.

02:27:01.168 --> 02:27:03.251
MATT: Roll damage once, and it'll go for both of
them.

02:27:03.251 --> 02:27:11.311
TALEISIN: So that's okay. That's 11 points of
damage and three points of psychic damage.

02:27:11.311 --> 02:27:18.100
MATT: Okay, so they both take a total of 14 points
of damage. It hits them both. The rider is looking

02:27:18.100 --> 02:27:21.476
really messed up from the impact. It looks like it
hit something on the neck and is now bleeding onto

02:27:21.476 --> 02:27:26.361
its chest. It looks a little dazed from the
impact. The wyvern is hurt, wounded, and the other

02:27:26.361 --> 02:27:31.390
guards are still stabbing at it with their
weapons. So it's not quite at death's door, but

02:27:31.390 --> 02:27:32.804
it's looking pretty--

02:27:32.804 --> 02:27:39.314
TALIESIN: I'm going to take another double shot at
the two of them. That's a 26 to hit.

02:27:39.314 --> 02:27:40.536
MATT: Hits, all right.

02:27:40.536 --> 02:27:43.887
TALIESIN: And then the second one, which jumped,
is 30 to hit.

02:27:43.887 --> 02:27:46.398
MATT: Okay, so roll damage and then they both take
the next hit.

02:27:46.398 --> 02:27:53.232
TALIESIN: Better. 15 points of normal damage,
three points of psychic damage.

02:27:53.232 --> 02:27:59.763
MATT: So 18 total? This time, as the wyvern rears
up from the damage from the first impact, the pain

02:27:59.763 --> 02:28:06.300
causing it to put its wings out and puff up, it
goes through the wing and takes out the temple of

02:28:06.300 --> 02:28:09.587
the rider. The rider is immediately killed and
falls off the back.

02:28:09.587 --> 02:28:15.092
TALIESIN: Which means I still have one shot left.

02:28:15.092 --> 02:28:20.531
MATT: The wyvern is now in the process of trying
to get its wings up. It's realized how badly it's

02:28:20.531 --> 02:28:22.006
hurt and is going to attempt to flee.

02:28:22.006 --> 02:28:28.148
TALIESIN: That's fine. I'm going to take one more
shot. I'm going to do a sharpshooter shot at the

02:28:28.148 --> 02:28:33.193
wyvern. I'm also going to, just to be an asshole,
I'm going to do a push shot at him. I'm going to

02:28:33.193 --> 02:28:41.979
do a torso push. So that's, double-checking, okay.
That's fucking terrible. God damn it. Again.

02:28:41.979 --> 02:28:51.369
MATT: Again? He's going to aim and the same
mechanism-- You're having a reverse Percy day.

02:28:51.369 --> 02:28:54.798
Wow! There is balance!

02:28:54.798 --> 02:28:58.058
TALIESIN: And another ten points of psychic
damage.

02:28:58.058 --> 02:29:01.745
LIAM: This is just balancing for the Thordak
fight. It's all right.

02:29:01.745 --> 02:29:07.515
TALIESIN: And I've lost that grit point, because I
burned that grit point on the bird. So, ow! Run

02:29:07.515 --> 02:29:09.969
back in the tent. God damn it.

02:29:09.969 --> 02:29:13.380
MATT: All right, that finishes Percy's turn.

02:29:13.380 --> 02:29:15.737
TALIESIN: And deep into the tent. Like, halfway
into the tent.

02:29:15.737 --> 02:29:17.095
MATT: Scanlan, you're up.

02:29:17.095 --> 02:29:18.429
SAM: I'm up?

02:29:18.429 --> 02:29:20.870
MATT: Just curled up and shaking.

02:29:20.870 --> 02:29:27.546
SAM: Okay. My Bigby's Hand is still working,
right?

02:29:27.546 --> 02:29:29.874
MATT: Yeah, you didn't break concentration.

02:29:29.874 --> 02:29:32.698
SAM: I can move it, how far?

02:29:32.698 --> 02:29:37.879
MATT: You can move it--

02:29:37.879 --> 02:29:43.923
SAM: Move it up to 60 feet. Is that going to get
back to me in time?

02:29:43.923 --> 02:29:47.699
MATT: To you? Yeah. You can get it to anything in
the battlefield.

02:29:47.699 --> 02:29:51.637
SAM: I want it to do a 60-foot punch on the wyvern
in front of me.

02:29:51.637 --> 02:29:55.298
MATT: Go ahead and roll.

02:29:55.298 --> 02:29:56.537
TRAVIS: Hadouken!

02:29:56.537 --> 02:29:58.124
SAM: Okay.

02:29:58.124 --> 02:30:00.766
TRAVIS: Tiger!

02:30:00.766 --> 02:30:09.564
TALIESIN: I did well, and then I jammed again.
I've done, like, 30 points of damage to myself.

02:30:09.564 --> 02:30:13.037
SAM: Oh wait, I have to do a spell attack first.

02:30:13.037 --> 02:30:15.209
LAURA: I've done more than that to everybody
else.

02:30:15.209 --> 02:30:17.395
SAM: No! 15.

02:30:17.395 --> 02:30:21.481
MATT: 15 hits. Armor class is low on the wyverns.

02:30:21.481 --> 02:30:37.129
SAM: So then, oh, it's a lot. It's already up to
26. Oh. 42.

02:30:37.129 --> 02:30:44.069
MATT: Okay. The wyvern begins lifting up in the
air, trying to escape now. It's sitting here,

02:30:44.069 --> 02:30:49.180
whipping out. The guards are backing up, afraid to
get too close. You see Scanlan concentrating. As

02:30:49.180 --> 02:30:54.485
the wyvern gets about 15 feet off the ground,
Bigby's Hand swoops up, grabs it, and then plants

02:30:54.485 --> 02:30:57.023
it right onto the jagged rock behind it, piercing
it--

02:30:57.023 --> 02:31:01.293
TRAVIS: You made wyvern juice!

02:31:01.293 --> 02:31:05.413
MATT: It weakly goes limp against the bladed
rock.

02:31:05.413 --> 02:31:07.574
LAURA: Sick.

02:31:07.574 --> 02:31:11.574
MATT: That was your bonus action. You still have
your action and your movement, if you like. The

02:31:11.574 --> 02:31:15.145
two guards next to you are like, "We're at your
aid, sir!"

02:31:15.145 --> 02:31:20.865
SAM: I might need it. Flank me! We're going into
battle!

02:31:20.865 --> 02:31:27.036
TRAVIS: "Flank me." I don't think that means what
you think it means.

02:31:27.036 --> 02:31:31.165
SAM: So I'll-- I still have an action, right?

02:31:31.165 --> 02:31:33.298
MATT: Action and movement, yeah.

02:31:33.298 --> 02:31:42.581
SAM: I should probably heal myself, right? Nah.
I'll run toward the fight. Oh wait, there's a

02:31:42.581 --> 02:31:46.640
wyvern right there, isn't there? Ooh, I don't want
them to kill me.

02:31:46.640 --> 02:31:48.486
MARISHA: There's also a wyvern on my ass.

02:31:48.486 --> 02:31:56.496
SAM: All right, I'll attack the wyvern next to
Marisha's ass. I mean, Keyleth's ass. With another

02:31:56.496 --> 02:31:58.134
Lightning Bolt.

02:31:58.134 --> 02:31:59.497
MATT: Okay.

02:31:59.497 --> 02:32:01.374
SAM: I have one more level three spell.

02:32:01.374 --> 02:32:10.316
MATT: All righty, so the wyvern makes a-- Not with
a two, it doesn't. And for the rider. The rider

02:32:10.316 --> 02:32:12.259
does get a natural 20, so it does take half
damage.

02:32:12.259 --> 02:32:16.966
SAM: Okay. So 8d6. I got it.

02:32:16.966 --> 02:32:20.527
LIAM: What's it like looking at this shirt-mare
all night?

02:32:20.527 --> 02:32:22.692
MATT: I'm trying not to.

02:32:22.692 --> 02:32:25.242
LIAM: Hey, my eyes are up here.

02:32:25.242 --> 02:32:31.019
MATT: It's a great exercise in focus.

02:32:31.019 --> 02:32:34.270
SAM: 23.

02:32:34.270 --> 02:32:46.054
MATT: I hate you so much. With that, the rider
takes the impact of the Lightning Bolt and whips

02:32:46.054 --> 02:32:51.612
its head back around angrily. However, the wyvern
beneath it gets blasted by the bolt of lightning

02:32:51.612 --> 02:32:56.907
and throws it back. The rider gets just enough
back, and the wyvern falls to the ground,

02:32:56.907 --> 02:32:59.104
unconscious and slowly dying.

02:32:59.104 --> 02:33:02.234
MARISHA: You got that wyvern on my ass! Thanks,
man!

02:33:02.234 --> 02:33:11.267
SAM: And then I use my movement to grab both of
the guards and cower behind them. Close them like

02:33:11.267 --> 02:33:12.467
a door in front of me.

02:33:12.467 --> 02:33:16.216
MATT: Okay, so you move behind them, guarding you
right there. You now have two bodyguards flanking

02:33:16.216 --> 02:33:26.148
you at that moment. All right. It is Xanthas'
turn, now.

02:33:26.148 --> 02:33:33.629
LAURA: (groaning) I mean, he's so cool, but I
mean, he sucks a little bit.

02:33:33.629 --> 02:33:35.368
MARISHA: He's not that cool.

02:33:35.368 --> 02:33:37.334
LAURA: No, I mean, he's really cool, you guys.
He's the coolest.

02:33:37.334 --> 02:33:45.379
MATT: He sees the giant fall, but the firebird is
still in combat. There's other wyverns floating

02:33:45.379 --> 02:33:49.279
around, some being taken down in the distance from
other guards. It looks like the tide of battle is

02:33:49.279 --> 02:33:53.928
shifting, now, at this point. You guys, in helping
out the guys around you, both gave a morale boost

02:33:53.928 --> 02:33:58.924
and shifted the tide. You can see, the other
wyverns, the lizardmen, have been for the most

02:33:58.924 --> 02:34:03.865
part dispatched within the courtyard around you.
However, Xanthas, looking down and seeing the

02:34:03.865 --> 02:34:15.338
circumstance, kind of, "Uh, um, argh!" Releases
his hand. This is going to be against you, Vax.

02:34:15.338 --> 02:34:18.881
This is going to be a Chain Lighting.

02:34:18.881 --> 02:34:23.573
LIAM: I will use Evasion, of course.

02:34:23.573 --> 02:34:26.049
LAURA: That's good, that's good.

02:34:26.049 --> 02:34:33.277
MATT: That's a good call on that one. All right.
Chain Lighting's a little bit of a bitch, here.

02:34:33.277 --> 02:34:42.109
Let me pull it up. There we go. Sixth level. All
right, so, I need Vax, Grog, and Pike to all make

02:34:42.109 --> 02:34:43.620
dexterity saving throws.

02:34:43.620 --> 02:34:45.967
LAURA: Roll so high!

02:34:45.967 --> 02:34:47.721
TRAVIS: Danger Sense!

02:34:47.721 --> 02:34:49.482
SAM: Ashley Johnson!

02:34:49.482 --> 02:34:51.402
LAURA: Ashley Jenkins!

02:34:51.402 --> 02:34:55.209
ASHLEY: 15.

02:34:55.209 --> 02:34:58.251
LIAM: I didn't do too well. I only got 14.

02:34:58.251 --> 02:34:59.517
TRAVIS: 17.

02:34:59.517 --> 02:35:01.318
MATT: Okay, both of you fail. What did you get?

02:35:01.318 --> 02:35:02.272
LIAM: 14.

02:35:02.272 --> 02:35:03.781
MATT: All three of you fail.

02:35:03.781 --> 02:35:05.198
LIAM: Half damage for me.

02:35:05.198 --> 02:35:06.836
TRAVIS: What'd you have to roll to succeed?

02:35:06.836 --> 02:35:09.390
ASHLEY: I was just going to take my turn!

02:35:09.390 --> 02:35:16.585
MATT: I know! Well, that is 50 points.

02:35:16.585 --> 02:35:17.930
TRAVIS: Five zero?!

02:35:17.930 --> 02:35:23.045
MATT: Five zero. 50 points of lightning damage to
Pike, Vax, and Grog. It's a 6th-level spell, and

02:35:23.045 --> 02:35:25.053
he had a pretty damn high roll, actually.

02:35:25.053 --> 02:35:26.353
ASHLEY: I hate him!

02:35:26.353 --> 02:35:33.039
MATT: So yeah. You take half that damage.

02:35:33.039 --> 02:35:35.219
LAURA: (gasps) You're alive!

02:35:35.219 --> 02:35:37.372
ASHLEY: Oh, that's true!

02:35:37.372 --> 02:35:40.147
LAURA: You're wearing your armor!

02:35:40.147 --> 02:35:44.120
ASHLEY: If you're knocked unconscious by an attack
or spell, a blast of healing flames surrounds you!

02:35:44.120 --> 02:35:50.563
You immediately regain five hit points and are
lifted to your feet. All hostile creatures within

02:35:50.563 --> 02:35:53.983
15 feet of you must make a dexterity saving
throw.

02:35:53.983 --> 02:35:55.925
LAURA: Or take fire damage.

02:35:55.925 --> 02:35:58.776
MATT: Or take fire damage, yeah. It doesn't affect
the creature. You guys watch as the lightning

02:35:58.776 --> 02:36:06.569
streaks out from the top of the wall. Slams into
the back of Vax, who-- You arc up, your whole body

02:36:06.569 --> 02:36:12.653
seizing at the sudden burst of electrical energy,
which then bursts outward into Grog and Pike.

02:36:12.653 --> 02:36:17.766
Grog, it hits you and your muscles tense and you
drop the axe for a second. You reach down and push

02:36:17.766 --> 02:36:22.678
through the pain and pick it back up. Pike, it
slams into you and you watch as the light shines

02:36:22.678 --> 02:36:28.644
up around you, the smoke emanating from underneath
the plate armor. You fall to the ground. There's a

02:36:28.644 --> 02:36:34.357
brief moment of silence, and then suddenly, this
bright reddish-orange energy bursts out from

02:36:34.357 --> 02:36:40.126
beneath the armor, through the neck, through the
sides of the plate, and you lift up about three or

02:36:40.126 --> 02:36:44.219
four feet off the ground before landing back on
the ground, restored with a little bit of health.

02:36:44.219 --> 02:36:46.726
This burst of flame arcs out around you.

02:36:46.726 --> 02:36:49.461
TRAVIS: Jean Grey! That's amazing!

02:36:49.461 --> 02:36:51.844
ASHELY: I growl!

02:36:51.844 --> 02:36:58.480
MATT: Xanthas then goes, "Okay!" and darts back
inside.

02:36:58.480 --> 02:37:01.413
LAURA: I hate him!

02:37:01.413 --> 02:37:02.954
ASHLEY: He's the worst!

02:37:02.954 --> 02:37:05.793
MATT: All right, that brings us to Pike.

02:37:05.793 --> 02:37:17.001
ASHLEY: Okay! I sound so puny with this voice! I'm
going to try my tried and true pal, Guiding Bolt!

02:37:17.001 --> 02:37:23.931
I'm going to Guiding Bolt at fifth level, right in
the belly of the beast.

02:37:23.931 --> 02:37:30.302
MATT: So you're going to turn around to this
giant, angry ember-roc and Guiding Bolt it into

02:37:30.302 --> 02:37:37.792
the stomach. All righty. Let's get over here for
that assault. At fifth level, you said? All

02:37:37.792 --> 02:37:45.798
righty, that would be 8d6 radiant damage if you
hit. You make a ranged spell attack. It is right

02:37:45.798 --> 02:37:53.666
up against you in a ranged format, so you're
probably going to have to step back because it is

02:37:53.666 --> 02:37:55.783
ranged. Or it's disadvantage to hit. Up to you.

02:37:55.783 --> 02:37:58.553
LAURA: Don't take a step back, he'll hit you!

02:37:58.553 --> 02:38:00.414
ASHLEY: Maybe he'll fail!

02:38:00.414 --> 02:38:02.226
MARISHA: Would he get a strike of opportunity on
her?

02:38:02.226 --> 02:38:05.010
MATT: He might. It's your call. Or take
disadvantage on the strike, because it is a ranged

02:38:05.010 --> 02:38:06.902
attack.

02:38:06.902 --> 02:38:12.415
MARISHA: Wait, wait. Is it the big bird? He might
have reach. It might not be out of his range.

02:38:12.415 --> 02:38:17.663
MATT: If you're still within melee with him,
you'll have to step out of melee to not get the

02:38:17.663 --> 02:38:23.459
disadvantage. In doing that, he might get an
attack of opportunity on you. It's not just within

02:38:23.459 --> 02:38:25.319
five feet, it's getting out of the creature's
ability.

02:38:25.319 --> 02:38:27.333
ASHLEY: I'll do the disadvantage.

02:38:27.333 --> 02:38:31.799
MATT: Okay, go ahead and roll twice, adding your
spell attack.

02:38:31.799 --> 02:38:33.401
MARISHA: Big money, no whammies.

02:38:33.401 --> 02:38:38.495
ASHLEY: Adding my spell attack? Okay. So, 14.

02:38:38.495 --> 02:38:39.854
MATT: Okay, roll again.

02:38:39.854 --> 02:38:41.899
LAURA: No, that was with disadvantage.

02:38:41.899 --> 02:38:43.539
ASHLEY: I rolled two at the same time.

02:38:43.539 --> 02:38:44.995
MATT: Oh, with disadvantage? That does hit,
actually.

02:38:44.995 --> 02:38:45.979
ASHLEY: It does?

02:38:45.979 --> 02:38:47.817
MATT: Just barely. It doesn't have a high armor.

02:38:47.817 --> 02:39:03.778
ASHLEY: Ooh! Okay, so 8d6? Okay, so how many of
these, (counting). Oh, these were bad rolls. Well,

02:39:03.778 --> 02:39:09.525
that's a-- (counting)

02:39:09.525 --> 02:39:11.720
SAM: No break tonight, guys.

02:39:11.720 --> 02:39:15.808
MATT: Nope, sorry. We've been off for two weeks.

02:39:15.808 --> 02:39:23.980
ASHLEY: Do I add anything? It's just those? 22.

02:39:24.173 --> 02:39:30.688
MATT: 22 points of radiant damage against it. As
you blast it, this giant flash of divine energy

02:39:30.688 --> 02:39:35.245
bursts around it, causing this glittering beacon.
The next attack against it has advantage, period.

02:39:35.245 --> 02:39:41.113
You can see the creature itself, its flames are
starting to flicker. It looks angry, and it looks

02:39:41.113 --> 02:39:45.955
wounded. That end your turn, Pike? Are you going
to move? Oh, you can bonus action with the sword

02:39:45.955 --> 02:39:49.983
toward it and attack it if you want. So go ahead
and make another spell attack.

02:39:49.983 --> 02:39:54.970
ASHLEY: Okay. Guh.

02:39:54.970 --> 02:39:58.316
LAURA: That hit, because you needed a 14.

02:39:58.316 --> 02:39:59.876
ASHLEY: Oh yeah.

02:39:59.876 --> 02:40:01.863
MATT: So, 1d8 plus five, if it's higher than what
you last rolled.

02:40:01.863 --> 02:40:04.099
ASHLEY: 1d8 plus five.

02:40:04.099 --> 02:40:05.288
MATT: Grog, you're up next.

02:40:05.288 --> 02:40:06.469
TRAVIS: Yep.

02:40:06.469 --> 02:40:12.157
ASHLEY: 11.

02:40:12.157 --> 02:40:14.962
MATT: 11? To hit?

02:40:14.962 --> 02:40:17.080
ASHLEY: No, 11 damage.

02:40:17.080 --> 02:40:23.004
MATT: Oh, damage, sorry. 11 damage to the
creature. So, as the blade arcs past, striking

02:40:23.004 --> 02:40:27.024
again, you can see another flash of divine energy.
Technically that would've had advantage, I just

02:40:27.024 --> 02:40:30.647
realized, because that's the next attack against
it. So roll again.

02:40:30.647 --> 02:40:32.110
ASHLEY: Roll that again?

02:40:32.110 --> 02:40:33.215
MATT: Roll the d20 again.

02:40:33.215 --> 02:40:34.912
LAURA: Oh, because if you get a critical--

02:40:34.912 --> 02:40:37.250
ASHLEY: Ooh, yeah, that hits.

02:40:37.250 --> 02:40:40.774
MATT: Okay, so it's fine. I was seeing if it was
going to critical or not.

02:40:40.774 --> 02:40:43.299
ASHLEY: So another? Oh, oh, sorry.

02:40:43.299 --> 02:40:45.593
MATT: Yeah, because the Guiding Bolt gave
advantage on the next attack, and the next attack

02:40:45.593 --> 02:40:50.089
was the sword. So the beacon fades. It is now
Grog's turn.

02:40:50.089 --> 02:40:57.184
TRAVIS: Stupid big bird! I run over and I would
like to hit the giant flaming piece of shit.

02:40:57.184 --> 02:41:11.824
Reckless, Great Weapon Master. All the lasagna. 31
minus five is 27.

02:41:11.824 --> 02:41:13.689
MATT: That hits.

02:41:13.689 --> 02:41:16.180
TRAVIS: No, 31 minus five is 26.

02:41:16.180 --> 02:41:17.681
LAURA: It doesn't matter, it hits.

02:41:17.681 --> 02:41:20.932
MATT: You have to roll a 14 or higher to hit.

02:41:20.932 --> 02:41:23.889
TRAVIS: That's good to know. That's a 17.

02:41:23.889 --> 02:41:29.435
MATT: 17 hits. That's higher than 14.

02:41:29.435 --> 02:41:33.811
TRAVIS: And I'll do all three. 14.

02:41:33.811 --> 02:41:36.726
MATT: 14 hits, yeah. So, all three hit.

02:41:36.726 --> 02:41:38.489
SAM: Kaboom, kaboom, ka-blow.

02:41:38.489 --> 02:41:48.328
TRAVIS: 20, 21, 31. 31.

02:41:48.328 --> 02:41:50.818
MATT: 31? All righty.

02:41:50.818 --> 02:41:57.719
TRAVIS: Eight, 21, 24, 34.

02:41:57.719 --> 02:41:59.306
MATT: All right, 34?

02:41:59.306 --> 02:42:06.093
TRAVIS: Yeah. Six, 19, 21, 31.

02:42:06.093 --> 02:42:07.496
MATT: Okay.

02:42:07.496 --> 02:42:09.728
How do you want to do this?

02:42:09.728 --> 02:42:17.200
TRAVIS: I hit it twice with my axe, and with the
third one I pick up Pike and I use her to slice

02:42:17.200 --> 02:42:22.073
the bird open! Come on, Pikey-poo!

02:42:22.073 --> 02:42:28.858
MATT: Wielding Pike like a two-handed gnome, you
drop the axe on the first two strikes, the

02:42:28.858 --> 02:42:34.267
creature stepping backward. You jump up in the air
and, getting about neck-height, you swing Pike

02:42:34.267 --> 02:42:38.774
with all your strength. Pike, you feel your jowls
get pulled from the g-forces of the sheer strength

02:42:38.774 --> 02:42:43.993
of the arc. What weapon are you using in the
battle?

02:42:43.993 --> 02:42:47.804
ASHLEY: Oh, I'm using my Mace of Disruption.

02:42:47.804 --> 02:42:54.403
MATT: So as the mace comes through, it slams into
the side of the skull of the ember roc. Your hands

02:42:54.403 --> 02:43:01.482
go numb from the impact as the vibration shivers
through your body. You watch as the beak and the

02:43:01.482 --> 02:43:06.353
side of the skull crack and cave inward. With a
little (squeak) sound, it just falls over on the

02:43:06.353 --> 02:43:09.613
ground.

02:43:09.613 --> 02:43:12.732
AHSLEY: Yeah! Grog, it felt like I did it!

02:43:12.732 --> 02:43:16.057
TRAVIS: You did do it! Monstah! Give me a growl!

02:43:16.057 --> 02:43:22.488
ASHLEY: Arrr! I'm a monstah!

02:43:22.488 --> 02:43:27.490
MARISHA: That was the cutest thing!

02:43:27.490 --> 02:43:33.983
TRAVIS: I turn around and I look up at Vex and I
say, fucking cut it out!

02:43:33.983 --> 02:43:36.621
LAURA: I say, good job! I'm going to hit you in a
minute!

02:43:36.621 --> 02:43:40.985
ASHLEY: Oh, that's right, we still have him and
her.

02:43:40.985 --> 02:43:45.771
MATT: All right, so we go back to the first round.
The two soldiers that are guarding you are like,

02:43:45.771 --> 02:43:49.363
"What would you like, sir? Where are we going?"

02:43:49.363 --> 02:43:53.465
SAM: Is anyone out there who wants to kill me?

02:43:53.465 --> 02:43:57.275
MARISHA: There's still the guy on the ground.
Right under my face.

02:43:57.275 --> 02:44:03.474
SAM: You two go kill that guy, I'll go somewhere
else!

02:44:03.474 --> 02:44:06.555
MATT: Okay. They both, using their full--

02:44:06.555 --> 02:44:08.660
LIAM: Just killed a pit fiend.

02:44:08.660 --> 02:44:12.329
MATT: They get all the way up to it. They don't
have a chance to attack, but they're surrounding

02:44:12.329 --> 02:44:16.658
it with their weapons drawn. They're going to
probably brutalize it pretty badly next round. All

02:44:16.658 --> 02:44:26.111
right. For the purposes of this round, too, you
hear a sound from up in the hallway, where Xanthas

02:44:26.111 --> 02:44:35.055
was. (pained shout) You watch as Xanthas goes
flying out a few feet and lands on his back. You

02:44:35.055 --> 02:44:45.784
watch as a small, brown bit of hair races across,
a giant, gleaming Holy Avenger goes across the air--

02:44:45.784 --> 02:44:47.547
TRAVIS: Yes! Platinum greatsword!

02:44:47.547 --> 02:44:48.961
LAURA: Who was it?! It's Kima?

02:44:48.961 --> 02:44:50.043
MATT: It's Kima.

02:44:50.043 --> 02:44:52.017
(yelling)

02:44:52.017 --> 02:44:58.448
MATT: She says, "Bahamut strike you down, you
knife-eared son of a bitch!" The blade coming down--

02:44:58.448 --> 02:45:02.455
SAM: Defenestrated.

02:45:02.455 --> 02:45:04.779
(laughter)

02:45:04.779 --> 02:45:12.497
MATT: Here we go. That is a 15 to hit. That hits
against his armor class. And a natural 20.

02:45:12.497 --> 02:45:14.653
MARISHA: Get it girl.

02:45:14.653 --> 02:45:16.405
TRAVIS: End him. End him.

02:45:16.405 --> 02:45:18.406
LAURA: Does he need to make a constitution check?

02:45:18.406 --> 02:45:22.731
MATT: Oh, he will. It is a concentration spell.
Ooh, double sixes on the first one.

02:45:22.731 --> 02:45:24.262
TRAVIS: Don't you wanna shoot me again?

02:45:24.262 --> 02:45:28.063
LAURA: I'm pretty sure. No, right now I definitely
want to shoot you again.

02:45:28.063 --> 02:45:29.566
TRAVIS: Oh, okay.

02:45:29.566 --> 02:45:48.649
MATT: 21 points of damage on the first strike. On
the critical, that is 25. Oof, that's rough. So,

02:45:48.649 --> 02:45:52.611
having to make a concentration check on both on
those. The first one is a 15, succeeds on the

02:45:52.611 --> 02:45:54.825
first hit. The second one does not!

02:45:54.825 --> 02:45:56.393
LAURA: Yes!

02:45:56.393 --> 02:45:59.607
MATT: It's half damage, he rolled a ten, he needed
to roll 13 or higher.

02:45:59.607 --> 02:46:01.109
MARISHA: That was on the critical, right?

02:46:01.109 --> 02:46:06.046
MATT: Yeah, it was on the critical. So the
concentration spell ends, you have control of your

02:46:06.046 --> 02:46:07.282
mind again.

02:46:07.282 --> 02:46:08.902
LAURA: Tell me it's my turn.

02:46:08.902 --> 02:46:12.750
MATT: After that and Kima unloading on him, yes,
it is.

02:46:12.750 --> 02:46:14.023
ASHLEY: Yeah, get him.

02:46:14.023 --> 02:46:15.606
TRAVIS: How many points of damage did he take?

02:46:15.606 --> 02:46:23.667
MATT: From that total round, with the Divine Smite
from her strike, he took 62 points of damage from her.

02:46:23.667 --> 02:46:27.235
LAURA: I'm gonna fly right above him and shoot
directly down onto his face.

02:46:27.235 --> 02:46:28.532
MATT: Okay.

02:46:28.532 --> 02:46:31.321
(laughter)

02:46:31.321 --> 02:46:37.174
MATT: You coast over, looking down at him on the
ground. He is prone currently, so you have

02:46:37.174 --> 02:46:38.624
disadvantage on the attacks.

02:46:38.624 --> 02:46:40.724
LAURA: (triumphant laughter) And Kima's standing
next to him?

02:46:40.724 --> 02:46:41.962
MATT: Yeah.

02:46:41.962 --> 02:46:43.321
MATT: Disadvantage.

02:46:43.321 --> 02:46:44.412
LAURA: Oh, he's prone?

02:46:44.412 --> 02:46:45.470
MATT: He's prone.

02:46:45.470 --> 02:46:47.058
LAURA: Why do I get disadvantage because he's
prone?

02:46:47.058 --> 02:46:49.513
MATT: It's ranged attack, so when things are on
the ground, they're a little harder--

02:46:49.513 --> 02:46:53.846
LIAM: If Kima's next to him, as a rogue, does it
cancel out and she gets advantage from her ally?

02:46:53.846 --> 02:46:57.338
MATT: You don't get advantage from an ally being
adjacent. You get to sneak attack them if they're

02:46:57.338 --> 02:46:58.478
adjacent.

02:46:58.478 --> 02:46:59.565
LIAM: Thanks.

02:46:59.565 --> 02:47:00.856
MATT: No worries.

02:47:00.856 --> 02:47:01.892
SAM: You got this.

02:47:01.892 --> 02:47:05.964
LAURA: Psh. Six-- no, 18?

02:47:05.964 --> 02:47:09.805
MATT: Hits. His armor class isn't very high. He's
a little mage dude.

02:47:09.805 --> 02:47:12.657
LAURA: 18, and the other one definitely hits. 20.

02:47:12.657 --> 02:47:14.534
MATT: Yeah, both still hit with disadvantage.

02:47:14.534 --> 02:47:15.737
TRAVIS: Nice!

02:47:15.737 --> 02:47:16.797
MATT: And you get sneak attack--

02:47:16.797 --> 02:47:18.345
LAURA: And I Hunter's Mark him because he's a
fucking dick!

02:47:18.345 --> 02:47:24.864
MATT: All right. You do get sneak attack on the
first hit because Kima is adjacent to him.

02:47:24.864 --> 02:47:38.297
LAURA: Well, all right. 18. Where's my dice? 28 on
the first hit!

02:47:38.297 --> 02:47:40.331
MATT: 28 on the first hit, nice.

02:47:40.331 --> 02:47:46.037
ASHLEY: He made a mistake.

02:47:46.037 --> 02:47:47.698
LAURA: 13.

02:47:47.698 --> 02:47:49.629
TRAVIS: He made a mistake.

02:47:49.629 --> 02:47:53.048
LAURA: 17 on the second hit.

02:47:53.048 --> 02:47:54.903
MATT: 17 on the second hit?

02:47:54.903 --> 02:47:55.971
LAURA: Yeah.

02:47:55.971 --> 02:47:57.118
MATT: How do you want to do this?

02:47:57.118 --> 02:47:58.835
(cheering)

02:47:58.835 --> 02:48:01.482
MARISHA: He was always an asshole! Always.

02:48:01.482 --> 02:48:04.587
LAURA: That's right. I'm gonna say, I always
thought you were a dick back in Emon. Don't fuck

02:48:04.587 --> 02:48:07.336
with me! Then I shoot him straight through the
face.

02:48:07.336 --> 02:48:09.491
MATT: As he's on the ground--

02:48:09.491 --> 02:48:11.695
TALIESIN: His heart breaks before the arrow hits.

02:48:11.695 --> 02:48:12.943
(laughter)

02:48:12.943 --> 02:48:14.523
MARISHA: He always had a crush on you!

02:48:14.523 --> 02:48:15.946
(laughter)

02:48:15.946 --> 02:48:19.948
MATT: He puts his finger up as you nock the first
arrow, and he goes "Wait, I--" and the first arrow

02:48:19.948 --> 02:48:24.836
hits him in the shoulder. He's like "No, (nervous
laughter) we can--" and he gets that far into the

02:48:24.836 --> 02:48:29.276
second sentence before the arrow (impact) through
his face. (whimpers, trails off) And the finger

02:48:29.276 --> 02:48:31.733
goes limp as his eyes go a little dead in the
face.

02:48:31.733 --> 02:48:33.114
LIAM: Slightly sad.

02:48:33.114 --> 02:48:35.119
LAURA: I turn back round and I go, sorry, Grog.

02:48:35.119 --> 02:48:38.378
MATT: Kima looks up and you and goes, (frustrated
noise) "He was mine!"

02:48:38.378 --> 02:48:41.150
LAURA: No, Kima. He was mine.

02:48:41.150 --> 02:48:43.412
(laughter)

02:48:43.412 --> 02:48:45.651
MATT: She takes the blade and (impact) stabs him
anyway.

02:48:45.651 --> 02:48:47.317
(laughter)

02:48:47.317 --> 02:48:52.800
MATT: You see some of the wyverns, the few
surviving now, are starting to scatter and head

02:48:52.800 --> 02:48:57.286
back towards Emon. It looks like the ranks have
broken and the tide has definitely turned at this

02:48:57.286 --> 02:49:02.173
point. As you all begin to gather yourselves, the
last lizard man on the ground over there is just

02:49:02.173 --> 02:49:06.890
being repeatedly stabbed by the guards until it's
no longer moving, and bludgeoned by the air

02:49:06.890 --> 02:49:10.477
elemental that's lording over it. You begin to
gather yourselves to consider the next course of

02:49:10.477 --> 02:49:12.136
action. We're going to take a quick bathroom
break--

02:49:12.136 --> 02:49:15.315
LAURA: At ten o'clock, a bathroom break?

02:49:15.315 --> 02:49:16.897
MARISHA: Quick bathroom break.

02:49:16.897 --> 02:49:18.426
SAM: We need a pause.

02:49:18.426 --> 02:49:25.685
MATT: There's a little more in store here. We'll
be back here in a minute guys, we'll see you in a sec.

02:49:25.685 --> 03:00:39.998
[break]

03:00:39.998 --> 03:00:44.731
MATT: Hello, everyone, and welcome back. We have
returned from our break. Real fast, we had two

03:00:44.731 --> 03:00:49.336
winners. We had one winner from last week since we
had no episode, so we did two this time in the

03:00:49.336 --> 03:01:04.103
chat. The winners are Super Gimpo Man, who won a
flamebox elder hero vault from Wyrmwood. And we

03:01:04.103 --> 03:01:08.205
have a second winner, is Southern Dragon 22, won a
purple heart dice box.

03:01:08.205 --> 03:01:13.611
SAM: That's the one that I have.

03:01:13.611 --> 03:01:21.559
MATT: It's that color right there, for one of the
deckboxes. So Super Gimpo Man and Southern Dragon

03:01:21.559 --> 03:01:23.662
22 congratulations, well done.

03:01:23.662 --> 03:01:28.523
MARISHA: It does grant you cock lightning, that's
true. It's like a 5th-level spell.

03:01:28.523 --> 03:01:39.880
MATT: All right, guys, so, the dust of the battle
settling, the plumes of smoke slowly beginning to

03:01:39.880 --> 03:01:45.297
dissipate as the fires burn out from the previous
struggle. The remaining living soldiers begin to

03:01:45.297 --> 03:01:50.843
gather their dead and wounded. And you guys begin
to reconvene as allies towards the broken front

03:01:50.843 --> 03:01:52.732
doors to the outside of Fort Daxio.

03:01:52.732 --> 03:01:54.632
LAURA: I search Xanthas' body.

03:01:54.632 --> 03:01:56.288
MATT: You search his body?

03:01:56.288 --> 03:01:57.396
LAURA: Yeah.

03:01:57.396 --> 03:01:58.718
MATT: All righty.

03:01:58.718 --> 03:02:00.458
SAM: I'll search the giant.

03:02:00.458 --> 03:02:04.533
MARISHA: Can I scavenge from the ember-roc?

03:02:04.533 --> 03:02:07.045
MATT: Sure, if you want to.

03:02:07.045 --> 03:02:09.486
TRAVIS: Could I ask Pike to heal me a little bit,
please?

03:02:09.486 --> 03:02:13.255
ASHLEY: Oh, yeah. Where are you at?

03:02:13.255 --> 03:02:15.574
TRAVIS: Oh, you know, like a two-digit number.

03:02:15.574 --> 03:02:16.956
LIAM: What?

03:02:16.956 --> 03:02:19.540
MATT: How many points do you have, Grog?

03:02:19.540 --> 03:02:20.793
TRAVIS: 25.

03:02:20.793 --> 03:02:22.233
MATT: 25 hitpoints on Grog.

03:02:22.233 --> 03:02:23.542
SAM: I got nine.

03:02:23.542 --> 03:02:25.723
LAURA: Oh no, he asked. Does that mean that
something's going to happen right now?

03:02:25.723 --> 03:02:26.959
MATT: I don't know.

03:02:26.959 --> 03:02:30.194
LAURA: We need to sleep, let's all sleep. Let's go
to sleep right now.

03:02:30.194 --> 03:02:35.091
MATT: Right now? It doesn't work that way. All
right, so as you guys are looting, the giant has

03:02:35.091 --> 03:02:43.169
giant black iron plate mail on, which is very
heavy, it is-- it's going to take a few hands to

03:02:43.169 --> 03:02:44.197
pull off.

03:02:44.197 --> 03:02:45.616
TRAVIS: Not if we tagteam.

03:02:45.616 --> 03:02:48.339
MATT: As well as her great maul, which is also
very large.

03:02:48.339 --> 03:02:49.602
LIAM: Gauche.

03:02:49.602 --> 03:02:52.058
MATT: And about 812 gold pieces.

03:02:52.058 --> 03:02:53.385
LIAM: I'll take those.

03:02:53.385 --> 03:02:56.266
TRAVIS: Like so big that I couldn't even wield
it?

03:02:56.266 --> 03:03:02.445
MATT: You could hold it, but you couldn't wield
it, yes. Sizewise, it's maybe about three feet

03:03:02.445 --> 03:03:08.697
taller than you, from head to pommel. And the
weight of it is unwieldy for your size.

03:03:08.697 --> 03:03:12.710
TRAVIS: 30 points.

03:03:12.710 --> 03:03:15.144
ASHLEY: I heal him 30 points with my last...

03:03:15.144 --> 03:03:23.879
MATT: Okay. You find on Xanthas-- you find 1,098
gold pieces.

03:03:23.879 --> 03:03:25.806
SAM: I'll take that.

03:03:25.806 --> 03:03:32.370
MATT: You find a potion of superior healing that
he didn't have a chance to use. And there appears

03:03:32.370 --> 03:03:35.526
to be a wand that is shattered.

03:03:35.526 --> 03:03:37.727
MARISHA: Take it.

03:03:37.727 --> 03:03:40.095
LAURA: I'm taking it, of course I'm taking it.

03:03:40.095 --> 03:03:47.619
MATT: It looks like it has broken, and there's a
little bit of a burn mark on the wood the wand was

03:03:47.619 --> 03:03:49.026
crafted from.

03:03:49.026 --> 03:03:56.724
LAURA: Okay. I inspect it. It doesn't do anything
when I inspect it.

03:03:56.724 --> 03:03:58.585
MATT: Okay. Make an arcana check.

03:03:58.585 --> 03:03:59.683
LAURA: Okay.

03:03:59.683 --> 03:04:00.987
LIAM: Take a look, Hermione.

03:04:00.987 --> 03:04:03.114
LAURA: But I'm doing it because Grog told me to,
and he's brilliant.

03:04:03.114 --> 03:04:04.498
TRAVIS: I know.

03:04:04.498 --> 03:04:06.915
LAURA: 11.

03:04:06.915 --> 03:04:09.310
LIAM: Check out the brain on Vex.

03:04:09.310 --> 03:04:11.416
MATT: Definitely busted. And it was once a wand.

03:04:11.416 --> 03:04:12.745
LAURA: Cool cool cool.

03:04:12.745 --> 03:04:14.479
TRAVIS: Are you sure it's not a twig?

03:04:14.479 --> 03:04:20.817
MATT: I hate you so much, Sam. Nothing, continue.

03:04:20.817 --> 03:04:25.220
TRAVIS: He never saw the bottom of it. Until now.

03:04:25.220 --> 03:04:26.486
MATT: No, not until now.

03:04:26.486 --> 03:04:27.705
SAM: Oh, is that true?

03:04:27.705 --> 03:04:30.093
MATT: Yeah. I've been focused on... other things.

03:04:30.093 --> 03:04:44.159
SAM: I printed some extras for you, Matt. Like,
sign them for fans... it's high derp.

03:04:44.159 --> 03:04:53.193
MATT: I blame you, internet. You're partially
responsible for this. Oh boy. Some things never die.

03:04:53.193 --> 03:04:56.580
LIAM: That's a legacy.

03:04:56.580 --> 03:05:02.909
MATT: It is a legacy, it's true. It's pretty
great. One of the downsides of having hundreds of

03:05:02.909 --> 03:05:07.985
hours of video of you on the internet is those are
everywhere.

03:05:07.985 --> 03:05:11.234
LIAM: We've all made awful faces and said stupid
things.

03:05:11.234 --> 03:05:13.438
MATT: It's wonderful. I'm glad you guys have come
to enjoy it.

03:05:13.438 --> 03:05:14.988
MARISHA: They've all seen us pick our noses.

03:05:14.988 --> 03:05:17.062
MATT: Probably, yeah. Somebody do a supercut,
please.

03:05:17.062 --> 03:05:18.694
TALIESIN: Don't.

03:05:18.694 --> 03:05:20.484
MATT: Too late, guys.

03:05:20.484 --> 03:05:24.430
TALIESIN: You're a horrible person. I have two
guns to fix at some point.

03:05:24.430 --> 03:05:26.361
MATT: Okay, go ahead and make some repair checks
while you're working on that.

03:05:26.361 --> 03:05:30.467
TALIESIN: Okay. Do I get a bonus if I'm not in the
middle of combat, or is that still the same

03:05:30.467 --> 03:05:32.040
tinkering check?

03:05:32.040 --> 03:05:33.427
MATT: Same tinkering check.

03:05:33.427 --> 03:05:41.920
TALIESIN: So number one, yes! That goes well,
that's a 17. That was on Animus. And then Bad

03:05:41.920 --> 03:05:45.975
News, which is slightly easier to fix, does not
fix.

03:05:45.975 --> 03:05:47.546
SAM: Bad News.

03:05:47.546 --> 03:05:50.971
TALIESIN: Bad News is broken.

03:05:50.971 --> 03:05:53.394
MATT: Yeah. Bad News, you're going to need
supplies to fix.

03:05:53.394 --> 03:05:55.827
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm going to need to sit there
with some money and spend some time with it.

03:05:55.827 --> 03:05:57.214
MATT: Okay.

03:05:57.214 --> 03:06:00.511
MARISHA: Hey, Mom? I cleaned the dishes.

03:06:00.511 --> 03:06:03.053
ASHLEY: Did we loot the giant?

03:06:03.053 --> 03:06:07.796
MATT: Yes, the giant was looted. You're trying to
carve something out of the ember-roc?

03:06:07.796 --> 03:06:09.477
MARISHA: Yes I am. Nature check?

03:06:09.477 --> 03:06:11.469
MATT: Go ahead and make a nature check, with
advantage.

03:06:11.469 --> 03:06:15.802
MARISHA: Gil, don't fuck me, Gil. Gil, god damn
it, Gil.

03:06:15.802 --> 03:06:18.888
(laughter)

03:06:18.888 --> 03:06:23.551
MARISHA: But with advantage, it is a 25.

03:06:23.551 --> 03:06:30.989
MATT: Okay. It's hard to pull a lot from the body,
because the nature of the ember-roc, as it passes

03:06:30.989 --> 03:06:36.864
away, parts of it begin to turn to ash, but you do
manage to pull from a portion of its torso what's

03:06:36.864 --> 03:06:44.537
called ember-roc oil. It is a flammable liquid
that burns like a napalm.

03:06:44.537 --> 03:06:46.690
MARISHA: Like napalm?

03:06:46.690 --> 03:06:52.523
MATT: You get about roughly a gallon of it to
extract. Because the rest of it's ruined for it.

03:06:52.523 --> 03:07:01.772
It's worth about 750 gold, if you were to try and
sell it. It's very volatile, depending on how you

03:07:01.772 --> 03:07:03.973
store it, just so you're aware.

03:07:03.973 --> 03:07:08.042
SAM: Cool, man.

03:07:08.042 --> 03:07:10.588
LIAM: Oh man, drop some Mentos in there.

03:07:10.588 --> 03:07:14.712
MARISHA: Percy, do you have any vials left?

03:07:14.712 --> 03:07:17.114
TALIESIN: In theory, I should have some vials
left.

03:07:17.114 --> 03:07:20.253
SAM: Can it hold a gallon?

03:07:20.253 --> 03:07:21.426
TALIESIN: Not a gallon's worth.

03:07:21.426 --> 03:07:27.684
MARISHA: Not a gallon, but I just want a couple,
and I hand a couple to Vex and Vax. Just a couple

03:07:27.684 --> 03:07:29.187
vials of the--

03:07:29.187 --> 03:07:32.620
MATT: So you guys have a vial of ember-roc oil.

03:07:32.620 --> 03:07:34.186
MARISHA: Yep, nitroglycerin.

03:07:34.186 --> 03:07:35.944
MATT: Kind of. In a way.

03:07:35.944 --> 03:07:39.934
MARISHA: You can either make a really great
molotov cocktail, or maybe some flaming arrows.

03:07:39.934 --> 03:07:48.320
MATT: You're not certain. The book that you have
that details some of these creatures, the thing

03:07:48.320 --> 03:07:53.322
that you had found earlier in the campaign, it
doesn't tell you details of how the actual liquid

03:07:53.322 --> 03:07:58.564
is triggered, it just says that it is fiery and
burns very hot.

03:07:58.564 --> 03:08:02.022
TRAVIS: It's like the goo from Ghostbusters 2.
"Talk angry."

03:08:02.022 --> 03:08:03.921
LAURA: "Talk sweet."

03:08:03.921 --> 03:08:12.050
MATT: Sure. As you guys are taking this moment to
figure this out, eventually you hear what sounds

03:08:12.050 --> 03:08:20.129
like the crumbling of stone, and a few rocks
tumble out of the broken open entrance to the

03:08:20.129 --> 03:08:27.120
fortress, and you watch as a couple of guards
begin to come out, their eyes wide. They look like

03:08:27.120 --> 03:08:31.444
they were in armor and ready to make the final
stand. Among them, you see General Elle Gorgofon,

03:08:31.444 --> 03:08:41.031
the female head of this particular regiment of
Fort Daxio, and Kima.

03:08:41.031 --> 03:08:43.548
MARISHA: But what about Allura?

03:08:43.548 --> 03:08:57.131
MATT: You see them all emerge from it. Elle looks
out to them. "So, you've done well. Little late,

03:08:57.131 --> 03:09:08.316
"but thank you for the assist. We'll begin to
gather our dead." She walks forward and gives you

03:09:08.316 --> 03:09:13.183
all a nod as she puts her helmet back on. Puts her
blade aside and begins helping their soldiers

03:09:13.183 --> 03:09:20.739
begin to gather the dead in a pile. Kima steps up.
You can see her teeth are clenched, and there's

03:09:20.739 --> 03:09:25.593
still a shaking of rage in her fists, and what
looks to be streaks of dried tears across her

03:09:25.593 --> 03:09:40.110
cheek. "Xanthas betrayed us all. He arrived alone,
bloodied, asked for aid and protection. Since

03:09:40.110 --> 03:09:46.620
"Allura recognized him, we let him in. Stayed here
for a short time, saying how bad things had become

03:09:46.620 --> 03:09:57.475
"in Emon, and spoke with Allura alone. Something
sensitive. We found her ten minutes later. Come

03:09:57.475 --> 03:09:58.533
"with me."

03:09:58.533 --> 03:10:01.830
TRAVIS: Are you serious?

03:10:01.830 --> 03:10:11.506
MATT: She steps over the stone and leads you
inside of the fortress. She turns the corner,

03:10:11.506 --> 03:10:21.604
stops, staring into the room. As you guys
approach, motions for you to follow her. You walk

03:10:21.604 --> 03:10:25.814
up to one of the small meeting chambers, the one
that you met Elle with when you first arrived

03:10:25.814 --> 03:10:36.609
here. And as you begin to approach, Kima turns
back and says, "It's okay. Friends are here." And

03:10:36.609 --> 03:10:43.295
you walk in and you see Allura sitting really
scared in a corner in her robes, sitting in a

03:10:43.295 --> 03:10:54.275
chair with her knees pulled to her chest. Her eyes
widen as she sees you all, and she gets up from

03:10:54.275 --> 03:10:58.929
her chair and runs over, and the person who's probably
the first to walk in there would probably be

03:10:58.929 --> 03:11:01.572
Keyleth, at this point, and just wraps her arms
around you and just holds you for a second and

03:11:01.572 --> 03:11:02.927
shakes.

03:11:02.927 --> 03:11:07.875
MARISHA: Are you okay? What happened? We thought
you were dead for a second.

03:11:07.875 --> 03:11:11.304
MATT: She backs away. (distressed sounds)

03:11:11.304 --> 03:11:28.201
MARISHA: Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. What's your name?
What's your name? She's been Feebleminded. I turn

03:11:28.201 --> 03:11:33.051
to Kima. Was it Feeblemind?

03:11:33.051 --> 03:11:37.758
MATT: "I-- I don't know what that is, I don't--
Can you help her?"

03:11:37.758 --> 03:11:41.247
MARISHA: Yes. It's a restoration spell.

03:11:41.247 --> 03:11:50.121
ASHLEY: Yeah. I'm going to cast a Greater
Restoration on her. I have it. Can I-- well, I

03:11:50.121 --> 03:11:58.540
don't have any 5th-level left yet-- wow. I don't
have any 5th-level left, but I have a seventh. Can I

03:11:58.540 --> 03:11:59.984
cast it at a seventh?

03:11:59.984 --> 03:12:01.183
MATT: You do have a seventh.

03:12:01.183 --> 03:12:04.033
ASHLEY: Yeah, can I cast it at that?

03:12:04.033 --> 03:12:08.439
MATT: Oh, you can definitely cast it at a higher
level. It doesn't affect it, but you can.

03:12:08.439 --> 03:12:18.082
SAM: No, no, it doesn't affect the power of the
spell. It doesn't make it a more powerful spell.

03:12:18.082 --> 03:12:20.077
ASHLEY: This is so stressful.

03:12:20.077 --> 03:12:26.928
MATT: It's all good. So as you approach-- Kima, as
you begin to walk forward, your hands begin to

03:12:26.928 --> 03:12:34.449
glow as you reach out, your holy symbol beginning
to burn with a bright whitish-orange color that

03:12:34.449 --> 03:12:39.886
mingles with the red and gold of the armor across
your chest. As the glow sparks in your fingers,

03:12:39.886 --> 03:12:41.292
she goes (gasps).

03:12:41.292 --> 03:12:44.176
ASHLEY: It's okay. It's okay. I'm going to help
you.

03:12:44.176 --> 03:12:50.562
MARISHA: I try and calm her as best as I can to
help Pike. Any assistance I can provide.

03:12:50.562 --> 03:12:55.099
MATT: She reaches forward, slowly touches and
grabs your hand, and as it does, you watch as the

03:12:55.099 --> 03:13:03.275
light transfers from your hands and gauntlets into
her arms and upper sleeves. She winces from it,

03:13:03.275 --> 03:13:09.340
but you keep holding her tight, and as it passes
up through, reaches her mind, her face, the glow

03:13:09.340 --> 03:13:15.991
passes through and lifts off her, like this gentle
steam that lifts off her. Eyes roll back for a

03:13:15.991 --> 03:13:20.910
second and close.

03:13:20.910 --> 03:13:22.832
"You are a godsend, my dear."

03:13:22.832 --> 03:13:24.782
ASHLEY: Oh, I grab her and hug her.

03:13:24.782 --> 03:13:28.077
MATT: She pulls you in for a big hug and lifts you
up off the ground for a second before-- "You're

03:13:28.077 --> 03:13:30.350
"heavy now." Puts you back down.

03:13:30.350 --> 03:13:31.878
ASHLEY: I just have so much armor on.

03:13:31.878 --> 03:13:37.640
MATT: "That you do, that you do." As she pulls
back, she looks at you all, and immediately, Grog

03:13:37.640 --> 03:13:42.987
and Vex, you feel yourselves pushed apart, as Kima
rushes up and just grabs her around the side and

03:13:42.987 --> 03:13:49.660
says, "Don't do that again!" Holds her for a
second. Allura just rubs her head and says, "I'm

03:13:49.660 --> 03:13:56.288
"sorry. I should have been careful. We needed
allies, I didn't know--" And Kima says, "You shut

03:13:56.288 --> 03:14:02.530
"up," and she reaches up and gives her a kiss. She
takes her and holds her to her chest. Allura holds

03:14:02.530 --> 03:14:12.237
her, and you hear Kima quietly sobbing for a
moment, and she goes, "I-- well. It seems that

03:14:12.237 --> 03:14:22.321
"things have moved a bit quicker in your absence. I
think it's time to find what we have at our

03:14:22.321 --> 03:14:28.620
"disposal and do what we can to finish this before
it comes on us."

03:14:28.620 --> 03:14:32.266
LAURA: Did you receive any word back from the
armies?

03:14:32.266 --> 03:14:42.153
MATT: "They're about a day south of Emon. Syngorn
has returned. Mikael is leading them northward. I

03:14:42.153 --> 03:14:50.289
"haven't checked in. I'm sorry, I wanted-- I should
have let you know. I couldn't, I didn't--"

03:14:50.289 --> 03:15:00.505
MARISHA: Allura, I'm sorry. We should have been
those allies, here by your side, and we weren't,

03:15:00.505 --> 03:15:02.045
and I'm sorry.

03:15:02.045 --> 03:15:10.190
MATT: "It seems you found what you went for. Let's
hope it makes the difference."

03:15:10.190 --> 03:15:13.548
MARISHA: Yes. It seems it already has.

03:15:13.548 --> 03:15:16.199
LAURA: That's true.

03:15:16.199 --> 03:15:19.719
TALIESIN: We have something else. Where's the
body?

03:15:19.719 --> 03:15:21.485
SAM: What body?

03:15:21.485 --> 03:15:23.979
TALIESIN: We can interrogate him.

03:15:23.979 --> 03:15:25.439
LAURA: Xanthas?

03:15:25.439 --> 03:15:27.462
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, we can!

03:15:27.462 --> 03:15:29.246
MARISHA: I believe he's still on the wall.

03:15:29.246 --> 03:15:31.337
LAURA: Get that fucker!

03:15:31.337 --> 03:15:35.367
TALIESIN: Just because he's dead doesn't mean he
doesn't have to talk to us now.

03:15:35.367 --> 03:15:40.032
TRAVIS: I'll go get him. I'll go get him. I go up
and find the corpse of shitbag and bring it back.

03:15:40.032 --> 03:15:46.716
MATT: At which point, Kima pushes away from
Allura, her head still down. She sniffles back

03:15:46.716 --> 03:15:58.907
tears, looks up, punches her in the shoulder.
Allura bumps back and rubs her shoulder. "I know."

03:15:58.907 --> 03:16:06.122
"You know." Kima turns around and walks out of the
room in a little bit of a huff, her lower lip

03:16:06.122 --> 03:16:15.096
quivering. Allura now smiles for the first time
since you came in. "All right. If you can, do your thing."

03:16:15.096 --> 03:16:16.280
ASHLEY: Okay.

03:16:16.280 --> 03:16:21.554
TRAVIS: Should I put him on the ground or just
hold him? I'll hold him up.

03:16:21.554 --> 03:16:26.334
MATT: So you bring back, dragging this bloody
body, leaving this trail through the Fort. There's

03:16:26.334 --> 03:16:31.060
bits of rock and rubble around, and you're like,
"Oops!" Drag him over them as you go.

03:16:31.060 --> 03:16:34.523
TRAVIS: Whoops, sorry, ooh, that's pouring out.

03:16:34.523 --> 03:16:42.632
MATT: All right. So that is a 3rd-level spell.

03:16:42.632 --> 03:16:46.892
ASHLEY: Because of the necklace, I have one
3rd-level spell left. Because I've used three.

03:16:46.892 --> 03:16:53.589
MATT: Okay. So this would be the one. If you had
it prepared, it has to be prepared. All righty.

03:16:53.589 --> 03:16:54.762
Great.

03:16:54.762 --> 03:16:56.421
SAM: What are we asking this guy?

03:16:56.421 --> 03:16:58.233
TRAVIS: How many questions do we get?

03:16:58.233 --> 03:17:00.759
LAURA: We get three questions.

03:17:00.759 --> 03:17:02.412
SAM: What are we asking?

03:17:02.412 --> 03:17:04.071
MATT: Can ask the corpse up to five questions.

03:17:04.071 --> 03:17:09.822
LAURA: Why are you such a dick?

03:17:09.822 --> 03:17:13.215
MARISHA: You were always mean to us. Why?

03:17:13.215 --> 03:17:16.778
TRAVIS: You've been working with Thordak. What are
his weaknesses?

03:17:16.778 --> 03:17:19.628
MARISHA: What did he want?

03:17:19.628 --> 03:17:22.253
TALIESIN: The defenses of the city.

03:17:22.253 --> 03:17:30.788
MATT: Just be aware of the rule, too. The corpse
is under no compulsion to offer a truthful answer

03:17:30.788 --> 03:17:33.436
if you are hostile to it and it recognizes you as
an enemy.

03:17:33.436 --> 03:17:36.416
ASHLEY: So maybe just face it towards me?

03:17:36.416 --> 03:17:37.862
LAURA: Yeah, 'cause you're nice.

03:17:37.862 --> 03:17:43.796
MATT: You can also discern lies, if you get a high
enough insight. This is still-- this isn't free

03:17:43.796 --> 03:17:45.561
answers. This is still an interrogation.

03:17:45.561 --> 03:17:48.569
TRAVIS: What if we put a bag over his head?

03:17:48.569 --> 03:17:50.476
LAURA: I don't know.

03:17:50.476 --> 03:17:53.409
SAM: Who would he trust?

03:17:53.409 --> 03:17:57.162
LIAM: Lizard-skinned man.

03:17:57.162 --> 03:17:59.508
LAURA: Oh yeah. Could you make yourself look like
a lizardman?

03:17:59.508 --> 03:18:04.344
SAM: Yeah, sure, or I could make someone who we
know talk--

03:18:04.344 --> 03:18:06.245
LIAM: But you're so good with words.

03:18:06.245 --> 03:18:12.804
SAM: No, but I mean, I'm saying-- who would he
trust? I can make that person, and I can make that

03:18:12.804 --> 03:18:13.715
person talk.

03:18:13.715 --> 03:18:16.530
MATT: Well, technically, it's Pike asking the
questions, since it is her spell, so whatever

03:18:16.530 --> 03:18:18.538
questions you ask have to go through her.

03:18:18.538 --> 03:18:23.033
MARISHA: We have the Hat of Disguise. Can you give
her the Hat of Disguise?

03:18:23.033 --> 03:18:26.753
TRAVIS: What if you made yourself one of the
lizardpeople, and then you had her down and you

03:18:26.753 --> 03:18:30.106
were using her to get info for Thordak?

03:18:30.106 --> 03:18:32.270
TALIESIN: I think he'll know that he's dead.

03:18:32.270 --> 03:18:34.514
MARISHA: You think he won't care?

03:18:34.514 --> 03:18:35.799
MATT: Yeah.

03:18:35.799 --> 03:18:42.783
TALIESIN: So the trickery, I think it may be-- I
would say it's probably either an appeal or a

03:18:42.783 --> 03:18:43.861
threat.

03:18:43.861 --> 03:18:45.492
LAURA: Let's try the appeal.

03:18:45.492 --> 03:18:48.509
SAM: Let's build a game show set. He'll think he's
on a Japanese game show.

03:18:48.509 --> 03:18:50.088
(laughter)

03:18:50.088 --> 03:18:51.902
MARISHA: Wipeout!

03:18:51.902 --> 03:18:53.976
LAURA: Let's try to make him like us.

03:18:53.976 --> 03:18:57.761
ASHLEY: Let's try to make him like us. Like we
were a friend, we're sad that he died.

03:18:57.761 --> 03:19:02.145
LAURA: Yeah, we'll all back out of view.
Especially me.

03:19:02.145 --> 03:19:05.393
ASHLEY: God, okay.

03:19:05.393 --> 03:19:11.131
SAM: Do we know anything about his family? Because
we could always play bad cop, too, and threaten

03:19:11.131 --> 03:19:12.321
his family.

03:19:12.321 --> 03:19:16.993
MATT: You guys have not engaged him beyond a brief
fuck-you-type conversation in and out.

03:19:16.993 --> 03:19:27.472
TALIESIN: I can threaten him. I can threaten him.
I will threaten him if necessary, but we can try

03:19:27.472 --> 03:19:30.416
the carrot before the stick.

03:19:30.416 --> 03:19:38.776
SAM: All right, so what are we asking? What are
his weaknesses? Has Thordak had a visit from

03:19:38.776 --> 03:19:41.511
Greenie? Raishan?

03:19:41.511 --> 03:19:43.401
TALIESIN: How did they find out where we were?

03:19:43.401 --> 03:19:46.261
TRAVIS: Are there secret entrances into Emon?

03:19:46.261 --> 03:19:47.619
LAURA: Yeah, that's a good one!

03:19:47.619 --> 03:19:51.273
TALIESIN: What are the strengths of their army?
What are their weaknesses?

03:19:51.273 --> 03:19:52.896
MARISHA: What does Thordak ultimately want?

03:19:52.896 --> 03:20:03.175
LAURA: Who does Thordak trust the most?

03:20:03.175 --> 03:20:06.904
TALIESIN: Who in the city, especially.

03:20:06.904 --> 03:20:08.487
LAURA: Yeah, who in the city does Thordak trust?

03:20:08.487 --> 03:20:13.864
LIAM: Do we want to ask him what he knows about
the Clasp's activity?

03:20:13.864 --> 03:20:17.599
SAM: We're up to 20 questions, now?

03:20:17.599 --> 03:20:19.397
LAURA: Four, we've got four!

03:20:19.397 --> 03:20:22.113
TALIESIN: Also, other questions may lead to other
questions.

03:20:22.113 --> 03:20:26.329
LAURA: Okay, so that's good. Let's start with
this, and then we'll see where it goes.

03:20:26.329 --> 03:20:29.314
MATT: All right, what are you doing? Casting the
spell?

03:20:29.314 --> 03:20:30.238
ASHLEY: Yeah.

03:20:30.238 --> 03:20:36.816
MATT: All right, so as Grog throws it on the
ground, skids for a second, you begin casting the

03:20:36.816 --> 03:20:41.671
spell. As you're casting it, Kima walks up and
kicks it one more time and then walks away. You

03:20:41.671 --> 03:20:48.764
finish-- it takes you-- it's a very quick action,
but as you finish, you watch as the air itself

03:20:48.764 --> 03:20:55.333
seems to form this mist around the corpse, and the
mist absorbs into the body. All of a sudden the

03:20:55.333 --> 03:21:02.217
jaw opens. Air fills its chest and the head leans
up, the eyes still staring off into the distance,

03:21:02.217 --> 03:21:04.845
but it seems to be addressing you, Pike.

03:21:04.845 --> 03:21:13.175
ASHLEY: Okay, so I'm going to walk over to him,
and I'm going to put my hand on his face, and I'm

03:21:13.175 --> 03:21:22.743
going to say, my friend, I am so sorry that you've
fallen in battle, but I had to bring you back to

03:21:22.743 --> 03:21:33.972
ask you some questions. I just got so nervous.

03:21:33.972 --> 03:21:36.615
(laughter)

03:21:36.615 --> 03:21:38.970
LIAM: Where's the beef?

03:21:38.970 --> 03:21:55.071
ASHLEY: So we know that you've been working with
Thordak and I have some questions. Has Thordak had

03:21:55.071 --> 03:21:57.409
a visit from Raishan?

03:21:57.409 --> 03:22:00.069
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

03:22:00.069 --> 03:22:09.375
SAM: (quietly) Persuasion check!

03:22:09.375 --> 03:22:12.702
ASHLEY: 22.

03:22:12.702 --> 03:22:21.535
MATT: The head creaks a little bit as it tilts
upward. You can hear the unnatural puppeteering of

03:22:21.535 --> 03:22:34.257
the body trying to speak, not the spirit but the
body's memory. "He's had no visits. He speaks

03:22:34.257 --> 03:22:37.646
"through his crystals."

03:22:37.646 --> 03:22:41.424
MARISHA: Okay, we knew that.

03:22:41.424 --> 03:22:48.323
TALIESIN: (quietly) How did they find out where we
were? How did he find Fort Daxio?

03:22:48.323 --> 03:22:50.233
MARISHA: Well he speaks to his crystals.

03:22:50.233 --> 03:22:51.748
TALIESIN: But we don't know, like--

03:22:51.748 --> 03:22:53.888
MARISHA: Well, some dickhead ratted us out.

03:22:53.888 --> 03:22:55.136
TALIESIN: Who?

03:22:55.136 --> 03:23:00.179
ASHLEY: I just have a couple, or four more
questions for you?

03:23:00.179 --> 03:23:02.111
(laughter)

03:23:02.111 --> 03:23:11.104
ASHLEY: And then I will let you go in peace. How
did you know that we were at Fort Daxio?

03:23:11.104 --> 03:23:28.523
MATT: "Naught but two days before, maybe less, a
scouting party left Emon. Saw activity at the

03:23:28.523 --> 03:23:38.061
"fort. And when they checked, they saw you. And you
were marked."

03:23:38.061 --> 03:23:43.485
TRAVIS: Can you insight check a dead person?

03:23:43.485 --> 03:23:45.270
LAURA: Yeah, can we insight check him?

03:23:45.270 --> 03:23:46.534
MATT: Sure.

03:23:46.534 --> 03:23:49.725
MARISHA: Vox Machina, I'm assuming, considering
you left our--

03:23:49.725 --> 03:23:52.803
MATT: You get the sense that might be what he's
referring to, and you get the sense that long ago

03:23:52.803 --> 03:23:57.903
when you guys were high up on the broom looking
out towards Emon, you missed seeing something that

03:23:57.903 --> 03:23:59.443
was possibly--

03:23:59.443 --> 03:24:05.673
LAURA: I remember that, we didn't roll high enough
on perception. I rolled a 24 on insight.

03:24:05.673 --> 03:24:13.476
MATT: Okay. So far none of the questions seem to
be probing too deeply and he seems to be on the

03:24:13.476 --> 03:24:16.004
level with Pike.

03:24:16.004 --> 03:24:22.489
ASHLEY: Do you know of any secret entrances into
Emon?

03:24:22.489 --> 03:24:31.634
MATT: "Secrets. Just the Traverse Junction."

03:24:31.634 --> 03:24:34.711
SAM: Traverse Junction. We've heard of that
before.

03:24:34.711 --> 03:24:35.741
MARISHA: Yeah, we have.

03:24:35.741 --> 03:24:37.516
MATT: That's where he used to work. That's the--

03:24:37.516 --> 03:24:39.163
TRAVIS: The teleportation circle.

03:24:39.163 --> 03:24:48.568
MATT: "Or the tunnels beneath. But those are where
the Clasp reign dominion."

03:24:48.568 --> 03:24:54.256
TRAVIS: Two more.

03:24:54.256 --> 03:24:59.792
TALIESIN: Who within the city still fights-- who
within the city still fights against the dragon?

03:24:59.792 --> 03:25:02.531
Who will be our allies, who can we trust?

03:25:02.531 --> 03:25:06.503
LAURA: That's a whole lot. Who within the city
fights against Thordak?

03:25:06.503 --> 03:25:10.116
ASHLEY: Are we looking for allies, like who
doesn't--

03:25:10.116 --> 03:25:14.549
SAM: Well we want to know who Thordak trusts and
we want to know who Thordak doesn't--

03:25:14.549 --> 03:25:18.072
LAURA: We've only got two questions left.

03:25:18.072 --> 03:25:20.219
TALIESIN: Thordak doesn't trust anybody.

03:25:20.219 --> 03:25:23.272
MARISHA: Well, the Clasp is clearly working for
him now.

03:25:23.272 --> 03:25:24.495
LAURA: What?

03:25:24.495 --> 03:25:25.990
LAURA and TALIESIN: No.

03:25:25.990 --> 03:25:30.227
MARISHA: Well he said the tunnels the Clasp
"reigns dominion," so--

03:25:30.227 --> 03:25:32.609
TALIESIN: That's where they-- that's theirs.

03:25:32.609 --> 03:25:40.581
LIAM: But they might still be resisting. I mean
the question-- asking this shithead who still

03:25:40.581 --> 03:25:43.252
resists within the city will answer a lot of
questions.

03:25:43.252 --> 03:25:45.111
LAURA: Yeah. Yeah yeah yeah. Ask that.

03:25:45.111 --> 03:25:52.477
ASHLEY: Who still in the city resists-- I have one
job! I feel so--

03:25:52.477 --> 03:25:54.274
(laughter)

03:25:54.274 --> 03:25:56.020
LIAM: Can you understand a word coming out of my
mouth?

03:25:56.020 --> 03:26:02.654
ASHLEY: Computer! Who still in the city resists
Thordak?

03:26:02.654 --> 03:26:23.968
MATT: "There are a few groups. But beneath the
city the resistance builds. We've tried to smoke

03:26:23.968 --> 03:26:27.764
"them out but they keep moving."

03:26:27.764 --> 03:26:33.677
LAURA: (whispers) So the Clasp is still
resisting.

03:26:33.677 --> 03:26:35.224
LIAM: Could be.

03:26:35.224 --> 03:26:36.955
LAURA: Can I insight check him?

03:26:36.955 --> 03:26:39.031
MATT: Sure.

03:26:39.031 --> 03:26:45.317
LAURA: 18.

03:26:45.317 --> 03:26:50.902
MATT: Kind of hard to read for a dead body, but
seems to be legit.

03:26:50.902 --> 03:26:52.724
LAURA: On the up and up?

03:26:52.724 --> 03:26:56.328
ASHLEY: We have one more question, but is there
anything else?

03:26:56.328 --> 03:26:58.696
SAM: Anything else? Allies?

03:26:58.696 --> 03:27:00.369
LAURA: Like, who does Thordak trust the most?

03:27:00.369 --> 03:27:02.027
TALIESIN: Or what does Thordak fear?

03:27:02.027 --> 03:27:03.628
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah. I like that one.

03:27:03.628 --> 03:27:09.463
LIAM: Probably, probably. What about Greyskull
Keep? Because there was a tunnel from Greyskull

03:27:09.463 --> 03:27:11.034
Keep into the city.

03:27:11.034 --> 03:27:13.573
TALIESIN and ASHLEY: He might not know about
that.

03:27:13.573 --> 03:27:26.030
ASHLEY: Is there anything or anyone that Thordak
fears the most?

03:27:26.030 --> 03:27:34.693
MATT: "Thordak has no fear. Thordak rules all."

03:27:34.693 --> 03:27:38.381
LIAM and TRAVIS: Insight check.

03:27:38.381 --> 03:27:39.989
TRAVIS: One.

03:27:39.989 --> 03:27:41.481
(laughter)

03:27:41.481 --> 03:27:42.692
LIAM: Two.

03:27:42.692 --> 03:27:43.957
LAURA: Wait wait wait.

03:27:43.957 --> 03:27:49.380
MATT: You can't all make insight checks to cover
for the last person failing.

03:27:49.380 --> 03:27:50.486
TALIESIN: Four.

03:27:50.486 --> 03:27:52.104
LAURA: No, but I've been insight checking the
whole damn time.

03:27:52.104 --> 03:27:53.263
MATT: I know, I know.

03:27:53.263 --> 03:27:55.265
LIAM: But I get plus two so it's actually four,
Matt, so spill his secrets.

03:27:55.265 --> 03:27:56.368
LAURA: 25.

03:27:56.368 --> 03:28:02.398
MATT: 25. Seems to be telling the truth from what
he knows. You get the sense that in a strange way,

03:28:02.398 --> 03:28:09.135
while he was an intelligent fellow, he was also
kind of a sniveling patsy. And the way that Kima's

03:28:09.135 --> 03:28:18.649
talked off the cuff since this began to happen,
since you began to prepare for the corpse, she

03:28:18.649 --> 03:28:24.420
seems to have a history, or at least her and
Allura both have a history with him in the city,

03:28:24.420 --> 03:28:28.414
and he was basically a spineless coward.

03:28:28.414 --> 03:28:35.379
MARISHA: Well, I mean, it makes sense, to a
certain point. When you have a big enough ego you

03:28:35.379 --> 03:28:37.550
don't have any more fears, I guess.

03:28:37.550 --> 03:28:39.276
LIAM: Are we done with him?

03:28:39.276 --> 03:28:40.439
LAURA: That's it.

03:28:40.439 --> 03:28:42.846
SAM: I don't think he's going to talk anymore. We
should kill him.

03:28:42.846 --> 03:28:49.166
MATT: The spell at this point has subsided and the
last bit of energy and mist that had entered the

03:28:49.166 --> 03:28:54.923
body slowly drifts out of the open mouth and nose,
(gasps), and the corpse goes cold.

03:28:54.923 --> 03:29:00.288
LIAM: You guys can fill me in, in a bit. And I
grab his collar and drag him outside with the rest

03:29:00.288 --> 03:29:03.979
of the bodies and start overseeing the burning of
the bodies.

03:29:03.979 --> 03:29:09.300
MATT: Okay. And there are large pyres for a lot of
the lizardmen corpses and wyvern pieces, they've

03:29:09.300 --> 03:29:15.683
all been thrown. All the rest of the dead soldiers
have been rounded up and have blankets and cloth,

03:29:15.683 --> 03:29:19.344
whatever's nearby, to haul them over the wall and
begin to recount who fell among them.

03:29:19.344 --> 03:29:24.564
LAURA: (gasps) Can I fly up in the air and see if
I can spot the boys?

03:29:24.564 --> 03:29:29.927
TALIESIN: We have the stone, you can find the boys
with the stone. If you would like to use the stone

03:29:29.927 --> 03:29:31.137
to pick up the boys--

03:29:31.137 --> 03:29:33.567
MARISHA: Here. I give the stone to Vex.

03:29:33.567 --> 03:29:43.048
MATT: Okay. You concentrate on the stone for a
minute. Your form begins to shift. Your

03:29:43.093 --> 03:29:49.496
physicality begins to almost liquefy and then
swirls and vanishes from view. You open your eyes,

03:29:49.496 --> 03:29:55.431
and you're in shadow. You're in shade. You're in
this little nook at the side of the rock crevasse,

03:29:55.431 --> 03:29:59.432
and you hear two voices go (surprised gasp). And
you look immediately to your left and you see

03:29:59.432 --> 03:30:04.541
Hunin and Kyor are both there. One of them has
dropped the crystal on the ground--

03:30:04.541 --> 03:30:05.917
LAURA: Don't drop it!

03:30:05.917 --> 03:30:07.209
MATT: "Sorry! Sorry!"

03:30:07.209 --> 03:30:08.308
LAURA: No, no. That's okay.

03:30:08.308 --> 03:30:10.249
MATT: "It started glowing and I got scared."

03:30:10.249 --> 03:30:14.044
LAURA: I put it in my pocket. I'm just so glad
you're safe.

03:30:14.044 --> 03:30:16.401
MATT: "I'm glad you're safe too. Is everything
okay?"

03:30:16.401 --> 03:30:23.068
LAURA: Everything is wonderful. Do you want to
come back to the fort? All the bad guys are dead.

03:30:23.068 --> 03:30:31.204
MATT: They both look at each other. "Okay." And
Hunin takes Kyor by the hand and they both walk

03:30:31.204 --> 03:30:34.006
after you as you make your way back towards Fort
Daxio.

03:30:34.006 --> 03:30:36.137
LAURA: Okay.

03:30:36.137 --> 03:30:37.307
MATT: The rest of you--

03:30:37.307 --> 03:30:39.765
LAURA: I bamf Trinket out and let them ride on
Trinket.

03:30:39.765 --> 03:30:44.198
MATT: Okay! They both climb up after an awkward
five minutes of trying to convince them that it's

03:30:44.198 --> 03:30:49.666
okay. Trinket nudges them a little bit and they
get up on top.

03:30:49.666 --> 03:30:52.251
LAURA: He's got a taste for the celestial blood.

03:30:52.251 --> 03:30:56.336
MATT: They're both riding on top of him and he's
proudly walking. (bear grunts)

03:30:56.336 --> 03:30:58.162
LAURA: Yeah.

03:30:58.162 --> 03:31:00.316
TRAVIS: Babysitter Trinket.

03:31:00.316 --> 03:31:07.373
TALIESIN: I say we sleep here for the evening. We
also can go through whatever materials the

03:31:07.373 --> 03:31:14.250
invading army left behind. Cannibalize them for
our own. I suppose we can eat.

03:31:14.250 --> 03:31:16.329
MARISHA: I talk to Allura, I guess.

03:31:16.329 --> 03:31:17.743
MATT: Okay.

03:31:17.743 --> 03:31:19.316
MARISHA: Is she there?

03:31:19.316 --> 03:31:24.247
MATT: Yeah, she's nearby. She was helping gather
the dead, and she was talking with General Elle

03:31:24.247 --> 03:31:34.304
and getting the ideas of what the next course of
action is and as you approach her she turns to you

03:31:34.304 --> 03:31:40.447
and as she recognizes your approach and goes,
"Looking to probably make a jaunt to Whitestone

03:31:40.447 --> 03:31:49.596
"shortly and see what we've gathered on that end. I
can bring everyone with me if you'd like. You can

03:31:49.596 --> 03:31:52.394
"stay here if you like, but..."

03:31:52.394 --> 03:31:55.492
SAM: We should not leave them again.

03:31:55.492 --> 03:32:02.949
MARISHA: I would feel terrible leaving everyone
again after we gathered everyone. Who cast that

03:32:02.949 --> 03:32:08.294
spell on you? Feeblemind, that's very high level
magic.

03:32:08.294 --> 03:32:19.047
MATT: "It is, and it was beyond the capability of
that... man. But he pulled out a small wooden

03:32:19.047 --> 03:32:23.040
"trinket in front of me which shattered and sent me
into my stupor."

03:32:23.040 --> 03:32:25.047
MARISHA: It was Xanthas?

03:32:25.047 --> 03:32:26.147
MATT: "Yes."

03:32:26.147 --> 03:32:28.397
SAM and LAURA: He had that wand that shattered.

03:32:28.397 --> 03:32:30.754
MARISHA: Ah.

03:32:30.754 --> 03:32:34.123
SAM: Did anyone escape the fight to go report back
to home?

03:32:34.123 --> 03:32:38.091
LAURA: There were a couple wyverns that got away.
That's why I don't know if it-- whatever.

03:32:38.091 --> 03:32:40.248
SAM: So does the plan stay the same?

03:32:40.248 --> 03:32:45.589
TRAVIS: I mean we can come back and stage here but
we can't leave anybody here.

03:32:45.589 --> 03:32:47.712
LAURA: Say that again?

03:32:47.712 --> 03:32:49.355
TRAVIS: We can stage here, but we can't leave
anybody here.

03:32:49.355 --> 03:32:52.543
TALIESIN: No, we can't leave anybody here. But
it's interesting. If we're lucky, he's going to

03:32:52.543 --> 03:32:57.054
send more troops to attack and we can be long gone
by then.

03:32:57.054 --> 03:33:01.458
MARISHA: Be long gone? What happened to using this
as our base?

03:33:01.458 --> 03:33:03.149
LAURA: They know about it!

03:33:03.149 --> 03:33:05.990
TRAVIS: We can stage here. We can rally here. We
can't leave anybody here now.

03:33:05.990 --> 03:33:12.759
TALIESIN: We can't leave anybody here. We either
abandon or we rally at this point. And now that we

03:33:12.759 --> 03:33:19.312
know there are forces underneath Emon, that is
good news. That is very good news.

03:33:19.312 --> 03:33:26.065
MARISHA: Was it only the wyverns and the lizardmen
that attacked?

03:33:26.065 --> 03:33:33.820
MATT: "Initially. It seemed to be some sort of a
shock force. Apparently, that fire giant was their

03:33:33.820 --> 03:33:43.572
"reinforcements or a general, I know not. From what
you've told me, at the very least. There weren't

03:33:43.572 --> 03:33:51.820
"any powerful entities here at the get go, either.
I don't think it was sent as a full-scale assault

03:33:51.820 --> 03:33:59.775
"more than it was, at this stage, just enough to
harry and see what was here."

03:33:59.775 --> 03:34:05.625
MARISHA: Who was in contact with Xanthras?
Xanthras? Xanthas? Xanthas. Who was in contact

03:34:05.625 --> 03:34:06.705
with Xanthas?

03:34:06.705 --> 03:34:07.763
TRAVIS: Oh my lord.

03:34:07.763 --> 03:34:08.608
SAM: Zenith.

03:34:08.608 --> 03:34:11.236
MARISHA: Zenith. Who was in contact with Xena the
Warrior Princess?

03:34:11.236 --> 03:34:18.142
MATT: Xanthas. "None of us were in contact with
him. I hadn't seen him, probably in the better

03:34:18.142 --> 03:34:20.890
part of a year."

03:34:20.890 --> 03:34:22.323
MARISHA: Then how did he know?

03:34:22.323 --> 03:34:24.669
TALIESIN: They saw us.

03:34:24.669 --> 03:34:26.957
SAM: They said the scouts spotted us.

03:34:26.957 --> 03:34:29.799
LAURA: Yeah. They spotted us with scouts.

03:34:29.799 --> 03:34:34.154
TRAVIS: You had your hood up, it's okay.

03:34:34.154 --> 03:34:40.664
LIAM: What of the elves? Did I hear correctly that
Syngorn has sent forces?

03:34:40.664 --> 03:34:45.481
MATT: "As far as I know and the information I have
received from Syngorn, they've taken the rest of

03:34:45.481 --> 03:34:52.101
"the troops under General Mikael Daxio as well as
the forces of Syngorn and they're marching towards

03:34:52.101 --> 03:34:53.907
"Emon, one day out."

03:34:53.907 --> 03:34:55.090
LIAM: One day out.

03:34:55.090 --> 03:34:56.525
LAURA: (groans) Oh my god.

03:34:56.525 --> 03:34:59.555
TALIESIN: We could meet them at Emon.

03:34:59.555 --> 03:35:00.624
SAM: Wait, what?

03:35:00.624 --> 03:35:02.633
TALIESIN: They're marching towards Emon.

03:35:02.633 --> 03:35:04.155
SAM: No. Wait, what?

03:35:04.155 --> 03:35:07.314
LAURA: Yeah. So they're a day away.

03:35:07.314 --> 03:35:09.300
SAM: Is that true?

03:35:09.300 --> 03:35:11.378
MATT: "They're making their way northward, towards
Daxio."

03:35:11.378 --> 03:35:12.952
SAM: Yeah, to us.

03:35:12.952 --> 03:35:14.469
MARISHA: Oh, to Daxio.

03:35:14.469 --> 03:35:22.146
MATT: "They're a day out from Emon, but they have
to-- it's in the pathway."

03:35:22.146 --> 03:35:23.893
SAM: That's fine.

03:35:23.893 --> 03:35:25.064
TALIESIN: We want them here.

03:35:25.064 --> 03:35:26.789
MARISHA: That's not okay.

03:35:26.789 --> 03:35:29.302
SAM: Well, where else are we gonna meet?

03:35:29.302 --> 03:35:31.788
MARISHA: Well, if they have to go through the
battleground--

03:35:31.788 --> 03:35:34.641
SAM: They don't have to go through, they can go
around it; they're not idiots.

03:35:34.641 --> 03:35:39.121
MATT: "They will, and in doing so, it's about a
four-day journey on foot for those troops to make

03:35:39.121 --> 03:35:40.544
"it here to Fort Daxio."

03:35:40.544 --> 03:35:42.097
LAURA: Okay. So we have four days.

03:35:42.097 --> 03:35:44.719
TALIESIN: We don't have four days.

03:35:44.719 --> 03:35:50.240
TRAVIS: I would volunteer that we should head
south and meet them where they are.

03:35:50.240 --> 03:35:51.816
SAM: On the outskirts of Emon.

03:35:51.816 --> 03:35:56.057
TRAVIS: Yep. Better than being here, 'cause we let
people get away.

03:35:56.057 --> 03:35:57.513
MARISHA: We're sitting ducks here.

03:35:57.513 --> 03:36:00.153
SAM: So we're gonna march all the troops out of
here.

03:36:00.153 --> 03:36:02.397
LAURA: All the troops, which is like, 20 people
left.

03:36:02.397 --> 03:36:06.154
TRAVIS: You gotta reposition once you give your
position away.

03:36:06.154 --> 03:36:12.997
MATT: As you as that, Elle pulls forward, her
helmet under her arm. "Last count, looks like we

03:36:12.997 --> 03:36:16.855
"have 55 strong surviving."

03:36:16.855 --> 03:36:18.661
TRAVIS: Yeah, we're gonna march all 55.

03:36:18.661 --> 03:36:20.451
MARISHA: Out of 200 that were here?

03:36:20.451 --> 03:36:24.951
SAM: Remember that the original plan
was for Thordak to know where we were, and

03:36:25.080 --> 03:36:27.564
send Raishan to kill us.

03:36:27.564 --> 03:36:33.627
MARISHA: Where the fuck is Raishan? Where is
Raishan?

03:36:33.627 --> 03:36:38.279
LAURA: Well, we sent Raishan back to Whitestone
with Asum and then we left, so for all we know

03:36:38.279 --> 03:36:40.182
Raishan's there.

03:36:40.182 --> 03:36:42.612
MARISHA: Allura, you were talking about going to
Whitestone.

03:36:42.612 --> 03:36:45.789
MATT: "That was my plan, yes."

03:36:45.789 --> 03:36:48.531
MARISHA: And what were all of your goals, again?

03:36:48.531 --> 03:36:49.991
SAM: All of your goals?

03:36:49.991 --> 03:36:51.951
MARISHA: All of Allura's goals.

03:36:51.951 --> 03:36:52.865
MARISHA: What did you want to do in Whitestone?

03:36:52.865 --> 03:36:54.684
MATT: "That's a very broad question."

03:36:54.684 --> 03:36:59.922
SAM: We need to meet up with Raishan. We need to
find a rally point.

03:36:59.922 --> 03:37:02.085
ASHLEY: Open a magic cafe.

03:37:02.085 --> 03:37:09.496
TALIESIN: 55 men in a broken citadel is not a
plan. It was a plan before, it's not a plan now.

03:37:09.496 --> 03:37:11.205
These things have to change.

03:37:11.205 --> 03:37:15.467
LIAM: We've an army close to Emon. We do have to
talk to Raishan, though. I think we should go to

03:37:15.467 --> 03:37:21.373
Whitestone immediately, talk to her, and figure
out if there's any news with her.

03:37:21.373 --> 03:37:22.749
SAM: She was coming back there, right?

03:37:22.749 --> 03:37:23.779
TRAVIS: Yeah, is that where she is?

03:37:23.779 --> 03:37:25.100
LAURA: Potentially

03:37:25.100 --> 03:37:30.529
LIAM: But be ready to move to the army from
Syngorn, quickly. It might be our best shot, our

03:37:30.529 --> 03:37:33.207
only shot?

03:37:33.207 --> 03:37:40.418
SAM: Should we march these 55 blokes to the south
while we go to Whitestone? I'll stay and march the

03:37:40.418 --> 03:37:42.187
troops while you guys go back to Whitestone.

03:37:42.187 --> 03:37:43.803
LAURA: No, we need to rest!

03:37:43.803 --> 03:37:46.509
MARISHA: Okay, hang on, hang on. What time of day
is it?

03:37:46.509 --> 03:37:50.291
MATT: At this point it's probably a little later
afternoon; you're maybe an hour, hour and a half

03:37:50.291 --> 03:37:51.677
from sunset.

03:37:51.677 --> 03:38:02.121
MARISHA: All right. We can gather our most elite.

03:38:02.121 --> 03:38:05.021
LAURA: It started really strong.

03:38:05.021 --> 03:38:10.961
MARISHA: I can get a decent amount of people
through if we Teleport Via Plants very quickly,

03:38:10.961 --> 03:38:12.687
but not all of them.

03:38:12.687 --> 03:38:14.050
LAURA: No.

03:38:14.050 --> 03:38:17.356
SAM: I think the 55 will be okay if we send them
off into the wilderness.

03:38:17.356 --> 03:38:26.097
MARISHA: Here's the thing, 55 people walking near
Emon is not very covert. And it's clear that there

03:38:26.097 --> 03:38:33.400
are scouts everywhere; Fort Daxio was off the map
until we showed up. No one was watching it until

03:38:33.400 --> 03:38:35.048
we showed up.

03:38:35.048 --> 03:38:37.148
LIAM: But we are out of time.

03:38:37.148 --> 03:38:41.091
MARISHA: But we are what Thordak is watching.

03:38:41.091 --> 03:38:43.718
TALIESIN: So we have to be very careful of where
we go and what we do.

03:38:43.718 --> 03:38:47.079
MARISHA: We put everyone at risk no matter where
we are.

03:38:47.079 --> 03:38:52.593
SAM: No matter what, there's not gonna be another
attack on Daxio in the next 24 hours. So we can go

03:38:52.593 --> 03:38:57.028
back to Whitestone, we can spend the night here
and then go back, or go back now and spend a night

03:38:57.028 --> 03:39:00.122
and then bamf right back before there's any
attack.

03:39:00.122 --> 03:39:05.368
TALIESIN: Or we can send half the troops, as many
as we can, tonight, stay here, and in the morning

03:39:05.368 --> 03:39:08.174
send the rest, and we can go with them.

03:39:08.174 --> 03:39:10.054
MARISHA: To where Syngorn's army is?

03:39:10.054 --> 03:39:12.605
LAURA: But we're gonna have to bring those guys
back out here, right? I mean, we're gonna have to

03:39:12.605 --> 03:39:19.692
march with the 55 guys. So why send them through
to Whitestone? Why not sleep tonight, deep within

03:39:19.692 --> 03:39:21.534
the fort, wake up in the morning?

03:39:21.534 --> 03:39:23.650
LIAM: They rest up, we go--

03:39:23.650 --> 03:39:27.326
SAM: To Whitestone? Get info, come back tomorrow
if we need to.

03:39:27.326 --> 03:39:29.442
LAURA: Yeah, but we need to rest now.

03:39:29.442 --> 03:39:32.149
TRAVIS: You can't get 55 guys in the mansion,
right?

03:39:32.149 --> 03:39:33.480
SAM: The mansion, sure.

03:39:33.480 --> 03:39:35.525
LIAM: But the mansion can't travel.

03:39:35.525 --> 03:39:39.972
SAM: Unless we spend the night here first before
going to Whitestone bright and early in the morning.

03:39:40.024 --> 03:39:41.378
LAURA: Well, maybe we should do that.

03:39:41.378 --> 03:39:44.389
SAM: We need to rest anyway. I'm at nine hit
points.

03:39:44.389 --> 03:39:46.287
LAURA: Can you use the mansion tonight?

03:39:46.287 --> 03:39:48.658
SAM: No, I can't.

03:39:48.658 --> 03:39:53.970
LAURA: So we sleep within the fort. Deep within
the fort.

03:39:53.970 --> 03:39:55.303
SAM: Yeah.

03:39:55.303 --> 03:39:58.830
MARISHA: What's left of the fort? What's
undestroyed?

03:39:58.830 --> 03:40:02.889
MATT: The fort's actually holding pretty well.
Other than the front doors, which need to be

03:40:02.889 --> 03:40:08.792
repaired, and right now there isn't anything
beyond just putting things in the way because of

03:40:08.792 --> 03:40:13.564
the impact of the giant. The outer wall's taken
quite a bit of damage, but the fortress itself,

03:40:13.564 --> 03:40:15.527
for the most part, is standing.

03:40:15.527 --> 03:40:19.386
SAM: We'll be okay for eight hours of sleep, and
then we can go to Whitestone, ask around, come

03:40:19.386 --> 03:40:21.886
back if we need to. Let's go to sleep.

03:40:21.886 --> 03:40:24.122
MARISHA: Maybe we should have someone on watch.

03:40:24.122 --> 03:40:25.627
TALIESIN: Well, it is a fort.

03:40:25.627 --> 03:40:26.860
LAURA: We'll put the guards on watch.

03:40:26.860 --> 03:40:29.316
TALIESIN: They have a system.

03:40:29.316 --> 03:40:34.333
MATT: General Elle says, "I can do that; don't
worry. And don't make fun of my horns!"

03:40:34.333 --> 03:40:39.062
LAURA: I'm not, I'm not! I'm just saying that's
the sound they'll make if they come.

03:40:39.062 --> 03:40:44.532
MATT: "It's a very specific sound my soldiers are
trained to hear."

03:40:44.532 --> 03:40:47.576
ASHLEY: Of course, if you need us, you do blow
that horn.

03:40:47.576 --> 03:40:48.686
MATT: "Of course."

03:40:48.686 --> 03:40:49.830
ASHLEY: 'Cause we will hear it.

03:40:49.830 --> 03:40:51.194
MATT: "Yes you will."

03:40:51.194 --> 03:40:52.438
TALIESIN: I need to sleep.

03:40:52.438 --> 03:40:56.849
LAURA: Let's find a bedroom and lay the fuck
down.

03:40:56.849 --> 03:40:59.328
MARISHA: Are we sleeping in the fort?

03:40:59.328 --> 03:41:03.919
ASHLEY: Is there a room with a big fireplace in
it, and we can all just have a sleepover?

03:41:03.919 --> 03:41:07.623
MATT: If you want to, there is a hearth in one of
the common-room areas.

03:41:07.623 --> 03:41:10.608
LAURA: Is there somewhere to clean up?

03:41:10.608 --> 03:41:14.548
MATT: They do. There are a few bathrooms that can
be...

03:41:14.548 --> 03:41:19.130
ASHLEY: Are there hides and things, like, fluffies
we can lay on?

03:41:19.130 --> 03:41:23.863
MATT: There's nothing terribly comfortable, but
there are blankets. It does get cold this far

03:41:23.863 --> 03:41:29.833
north. It's not in the winter months anymore, but
just south of the Cliffkeep Mountains in this

03:41:29.833 --> 03:41:34.624
area, it does get kinda chilly, so there are
blankets, there are hides, there are things to

03:41:34.624 --> 03:41:36.033
keep warm in.

03:41:36.033 --> 03:41:39.656
LIAM: I mean, you just got used as a weapon; you
might want a shower.

03:41:39.656 --> 03:41:41.517
ASHLEY: Ah, I like the dirt.

03:41:41.517 --> 03:41:44.608
LAURA: I'm gonna go soak.

03:41:44.608 --> 03:41:48.625
MARISHA: I'm gonna crash as soon as I find
something fluffy to fall on.

03:41:48.625 --> 03:41:53.654
MATT: Okay. All right. The rest of you guys find
yourselves to rest for the evening? Okay. Those

03:41:53.654 --> 03:42:00.291
who care to, you clean up, and find rest as well.
The food is meager but serviceable, and you all

03:42:00.291 --> 03:42:07.899
find yourselves an evening's rest. Unperturbed, a
good nine, ten hours pass of intense sleep as you

03:42:07.899 --> 03:42:14.691
all are sore, you are all exhausted-- although you
do recover your point of exhaustion, Scanlan,

03:42:14.691 --> 03:42:24.178
that's gone-- as do you, from your frenzied rage--
You all come to consciousness shortly after

03:42:24.178 --> 03:42:28.944
daybreak, I'd say; you got to bed probably right
around sunset, or a little bit past sunset, so

03:42:28.944 --> 03:42:39.951
it's just starting to get the sun over the
mountains. The day is yours.

03:42:39.951 --> 03:42:43.031
LIAM: Well, we said what we were gonna do; we're
gonna go to Whitestone.

03:42:43.031 --> 03:42:45.474
LAURA: Then let's fucking go to Whitestone. Yep.
That's what we said we were gonna do.

03:42:45.474 --> 03:42:48.069
LIAM: Kiki, set us up.

03:42:48.069 --> 03:42:50.295
MARISHA: Sure.

03:42:50.295 --> 03:42:52.001
SAM: We have any trees here?

03:42:52.001 --> 03:42:54.438
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:42:54.438 --> 03:42:57.977
MATT: Allura raises her hand. "I can still take us
there."

03:42:57.977 --> 03:42:59.739
LAURA: Fuck, yeah, that's right!

03:42:59.739 --> 03:43:05.119
MATT: "That was the plan, but... I mean, it's up
to you; we could find a tree, I suppose."

03:43:05.119 --> 03:43:10.146
LAURA: Okay, but I have two extra guys with us
right now.

03:43:10.146 --> 03:43:14.518
MATT: "Oh... I cannot do that, unfortunately."

03:43:14.518 --> 03:43:21.340
MARISHA: Okay, you know what? I can get us there,
and Allura can get us back on the same day.

03:43:21.340 --> 03:43:23.385
LAURA: Okay, yeah.

03:43:23.385 --> 03:43:26.372
MARISHA: What are we getting at Whitestone?

03:43:26.372 --> 03:43:27.954
LIAM: We're gonna talk to Raishan.

03:43:27.954 --> 03:43:28.999
LAURA: See if Raishan's there.

03:43:28.999 --> 03:43:29.881
MARISHA: Is Raishan there?

03:43:29.881 --> 03:43:30.988
LAURA: Potentially!

03:43:30.988 --> 03:43:35.535
MATT: "I haven't seen Raishan. We've been at the
fort this entire time, waiting for your return."

03:43:35.535 --> 03:43:39.286
MARISHA: And she was getting Asum. You know what?
Yeah. Let's go. All right!

03:43:39.286 --> 03:43:46.766
MATT: All right. You find your way out to one of
the slightly charred trees in the main courtyard

03:43:46.766 --> 03:43:56.029
area, you open the portal. (whoosh) as it opens,
your two celestial-blooded children guide you

03:43:56.029 --> 03:44:01.844
through, as well as Kima and Allura, into
Whitestone. You emerge from the Sun Tree in the

03:44:01.844 --> 03:44:12.935
morning hours there as well. The city is quiet.
You can see that a lot of the guard has been

03:44:12.935 --> 03:44:19.305
gathering arms and armor just in case they were
ever called to be part of this fray, and the city

03:44:19.305 --> 03:44:24.987
just seems to be on high alert. But everything is
intact, Whitestone appears to be fine, and the

03:44:24.987 --> 03:44:32.102
castle looms northward from your current position.
You guys make your way towards Whitestone Castle;

03:44:32.102 --> 03:44:38.542
the guards greet you and lead you inside. Within
minutes, Cassandra has been summoned down and

03:44:38.542 --> 03:44:42.354
says, "Percival, thank God you've returned."

03:44:42.354 --> 03:44:46.934
TALIESIN: 'Thank God'? All right, why? What's
happened?

03:44:46.934 --> 03:44:48.978
MATT: "You're alive, that's--"

03:44:48.978 --> 03:44:50.185
TALIESIN: Oh! Yes.

03:44:50.185 --> 03:44:54.141
MATT: "Look, the last time you left, you did not
come back in the best of places! I'm just

03:44:54.141 --> 03:44:55.229
"beginning to think--"

03:44:55.229 --> 03:44:58.524
TALIESIN: I just assume that everything is going
to be bad news for the next-- Just assume that I'm

03:44:58.524 --> 03:45:05.268
going to assume everything is terrible every time
I see you for the next two months. Yes, we're alive.

03:45:05.324 --> 03:45:06.534
MATT: "Speaking of Asum."

03:45:06.534 --> 03:45:07.733
TALIESIN: Oh, no.

03:45:07.733 --> 03:45:09.001
MATT: "Come."

03:45:09.001 --> 03:45:16.518
LAURA: Oh, Cassandra, are there rooms for these
new guests?

03:45:16.518 --> 03:45:17.948
MATT: "Who are these?"

03:45:17.948 --> 03:45:23.915
LAURA: They're the sweetest! This is, um... Keurig
and Human.

03:45:23.915 --> 03:45:32.483
(laughter)

03:45:32.483 --> 03:45:36.554
MATT: You're the best foster mom ever!

03:45:36.554 --> 03:45:39.874
LAURA: I have them written down somewhere, but I
can't find it in my notes!

03:45:39.874 --> 03:45:42.764
LIAM: We met them at Booty, they're totally
celestial--

03:45:42.764 --> 03:45:44.369
MARISHA: They're totally great, man!

03:45:44.369 --> 03:45:46.048
SAM: Pumpkin latte...

03:45:46.048 --> 03:45:48.372
MARISHA: They can just crash on our couch for a
few months.

03:45:48.372 --> 03:45:52.302
MATT: You watch their noses scrunch a little as
you entirely butcher their names.

03:45:52.302 --> 03:45:54.386
LIAM: They have, like, angel blood!

03:45:54.386 --> 03:45:57.228
(laughter)

03:45:57.228 --> 03:45:59.245
LAURA: What are their names again? I can't find
it.

03:45:59.245 --> 03:46:01.643
MATT: Hunin and Kyor.

03:46:01.643 --> 03:46:04.020
LAURA: Hunin and... Kyor?

03:46:04.020 --> 03:46:05.632
MATT: Yes. K-Y-O-R.

03:46:05.632 --> 03:46:07.349
LIAM: Do you see all of this?

03:46:07.349 --> 03:46:12.207
LAURA: Got it. Angel babies. Writing it down.

03:46:12.207 --> 03:46:16.162
MATT: "Yes, we can find them a room; that's fine.
Not to worry."

03:46:16.162 --> 03:46:18.186
TALIESIN: We'll put them to work. They will be
useful.

03:46:18.186 --> 03:46:19.151
MATT: "Fine."

03:46:19.151 --> 03:46:26.924
SAM: I mean, not right away. They've been slaves.
Why don't we give them a day off?

03:46:26.924 --> 03:46:29.019
ASHLEY: How old are they?

03:46:29.019 --> 03:46:35.300
MATT: They're in their late teens. Mid- to late
teens.

03:46:35.300 --> 03:46:38.741
SAM: Why don't we just give them some schooling?

03:46:38.741 --> 03:46:41.748
LAURA: I guess they're about the same age as
Cassandra, then, huh?

03:46:41.748 --> 03:46:46.890
MATT: Cassandra's a little bit older. Though she
doesn't act it. She acts, like, fifteen years her

03:46:46.890 --> 03:46:49.537
senior. And always has.

03:46:49.537 --> 03:46:53.975
TALIESIN: Yes. All right. Asum?

03:46:53.975 --> 03:46:58.744
MATT: All right, you guys head upstairs with her;
she leads you-- oh, no. She does not lead you

03:46:58.744 --> 03:47:08.847
upstairs. She leads you downstairs, through the
tunnels, towards the ziggurat. And as she's

03:47:08.847 --> 03:47:17.333
walking along, she says, "Well. We've managed to
relocate the meeting room. And it required a bit

03:47:17.333 --> 03:47:31.007
"of careful discussion as to our current allies. As
well, the transport was a bit awkward for Asum and

03:47:31.007 --> 03:47:43.816
"his companion, and the dragon cannot maintain her
usual form around the ziggurat, so just be ready."

03:47:43.816 --> 03:47:45.674
TALIESIN: I assumed.

03:47:45.674 --> 03:47:50.474
MATT: As you guys make your way into the ziggurat
chamber, you can see already there's the platform

03:47:50.474 --> 03:47:55.069
on the outside of the central area where the new
situation is set. And you see there's a table, and

03:47:55.069 --> 03:47:58.738
you can already hear discussion off that way, and
there are a few servants that are bringing food

03:47:58.738 --> 03:48:02.798
and drinks up there as part of the morning
breakfast for those who are in their meeting. And

03:48:02.798 --> 03:48:08.276
you see there, right on the outskirts of the
table, wrapped and curled up, a gargantuan green

03:48:08.276 --> 03:48:13.919
dragon with its head resting on its claws that is
listening in on part of the conversation.

03:48:13.919 --> 03:48:16.593
LAURA: Oh, damn.

03:48:16.593 --> 03:48:17.866
LIAM: Hey, little guy.

03:48:17.866 --> 03:48:22.036
TALIESIN: Well, things have not been going well on
our end; how about yours?

03:48:22.036 --> 03:48:23.238
MATT: To Cassandra?

03:48:23.238 --> 03:48:25.594
TALIESIN: Well, to the room.

03:48:25.594 --> 03:48:32.717
MATT: To the room? Okay, so as you head up to the
platform, everyone pauses and looks over. Asum

03:48:32.717 --> 03:48:39.443
stands up-- you can see now, this being the real
Asum-- acid-scarred across the face, just as

03:48:39.443 --> 03:48:46.196
Raishan's form arriving was, and sitting on the
opposite end of Raishan, and you can see there's

03:48:46.196 --> 03:48:52.144
this very much kind of-- especially as a master of
spies and information, understands the importance

03:48:52.144 --> 03:48:57.018
of, you know, strange bedfellows, given the
circumstances in war, but is still not at ease and

03:48:57.018 --> 03:49:03.123
doesn't seem to keep-- always has one eye on the
dragon at all times, but gives a nod. "It's good

03:49:03.123 --> 03:49:13.541
"to see that you're all alive. And we have much to
discuss. Please, come sit. You've met Brom

03:49:13.541 --> 03:49:19.234
"before." And you look over and you can see Brom
Goldhand, the same square-jawed, shorter, black

03:49:19.234 --> 03:49:28.758
unkempt hair, the cleric of Ioun that was and is
part of the council. However, the skin is covered

03:49:28.758 --> 03:49:33.779
in burn scars. Like, the face, some of the
features are kind of missing. All the exposed

03:49:33.779 --> 03:49:42.698
elements beyond the armor are just burned. But he
stands and bows to everyone. "It is good to see

03:49:42.698 --> 03:49:51.357
"you all alive." He sits down at the table,
Cassandra takes a seat. Raishan has said nothing,

03:49:51.357 --> 03:50:03.614
is just watching you all as you sit down, gives a
nod. Allura flanks behind you. Kima has been asked

03:50:03.614 --> 03:50:09.872
not to attend. (chuckles) Allura sits down on--
there's a few stools, whatever chairs were

03:50:09.872 --> 03:50:14.979
available were brought in here, so it's a
ramshackle meeting room, given how many butts have

03:50:14.979 --> 03:50:16.642
to sit around this area.

03:50:16.642 --> 03:50:18.194
LAURA: I'll stand.

03:50:18.194 --> 03:50:29.847
MATT: But you are all here. "So. I've been told
that you were at Daxio and gathering other allies

03:50:29.847 --> 03:50:35.533
"about. Please, let us know what the circumstance
is from your end of things. Things are not as well

03:50:35.533 --> 03:50:37.782
"from ours."

03:50:37.782 --> 03:50:39.382
TRAVIS: That sucks to hear.

03:50:39.382 --> 03:50:42.192
TALIESIN: Daxio was discovered and attacked
prematurely.

03:50:42.192 --> 03:50:43.599
MATT: "Wonderful."

03:50:43.599 --> 03:50:51.056
TALIESIN: A group has already-- a small strike
group came and attacked the fort, did damage-- I

03:50:51.056 --> 03:50:53.646
wouldn't necessarily call it significant damage--

03:50:53.646 --> 03:50:56.539
LAURA: But wiped out a large percentage of the
force there.

03:50:56.539 --> 03:50:58.093
TALIESIN: Decimated it.

03:50:58.093 --> 03:51:00.775
TRAVIS: 75 percent.

03:51:00.775 --> 03:51:01.972
LIAM: Grog?

03:51:01.972 --> 03:51:03.494
TRAVIS: I mean, whatever those words mean.

03:51:03.494 --> 03:51:09.848
(laughter)

03:51:09.848 --> 03:51:18.805
TALIESIN: Broken clock. That's a very good guess,
Grog. I've completely lost my train of thought.

03:51:18.805 --> 03:51:21.401
TRAVIS: Approximately.

03:51:21.401 --> 03:51:26.129
MARISHA: The problem is that we've summoned many
of our allies to Fort Daxio and they are currently

03:51:26.129 --> 03:51:29.479
in transit to that current location.

03:51:29.479 --> 03:51:30.981
MATT: "But Daxio's been attacked."

03:51:30.981 --> 03:51:34.005
MARISHA: Correct.

03:51:34.005 --> 03:51:41.491
MATT: "Then I would not recommend taking folks to
Fort Daxio, especially if it's sustained damage.

03:51:41.491 --> 03:51:57.850
"Well, we've been busy in Emon." The eyes glance
over at Raishan. "And, well, needless to say,

03:51:57.850 --> 03:52:03.234
"things have gone a bit strange. We've been working
with Spireling Shenn and the Clasp, and we've been

03:52:03.234 --> 03:52:11.878
"able to smuggle thousands of denizens of Emon
beneath the city. Those that were not directly

03:52:11.878 --> 03:52:19.758
"enslaved or gave fealty to the Cinder King out of
fear and other interests we've been able to keep

03:52:19.758 --> 03:52:27.687
"safe, and we've moved through the tunnels as often
as possible. There are still many, many, &lt;i&gt;many&lt;/i&gt;

03:52:27.687 --> 03:52:35.686
"wyvern riders that patrol the city; the townfolk
have run out of offerings and are now being sent

03:52:35.686 --> 03:52:46.378
"out in slave groups to pull goods from nearby
cities to bring at the feet of the dragon. We also

03:52:46.378 --> 03:52:51.406
"have a rising volcanic mass rising up beneath the
city that has consumed a number of the underground

03:52:51.406 --> 03:52:59.381
"Clasp tunnels and has been slowly pinching off our
mobility beneath the town, so our intent to

03:52:59.381 --> 03:53:05.479
"hopefully find some sort of retort or vengeance
and eventually take down the dragon... that clock

03:53:05.479 --> 03:53:15.762
"is definitely ticking. Now. We've been keeping as
best an eye on Thordak as we can. Brom, bless him

03:53:15.762 --> 03:53:20.369
"and his sacrifices, has been our front man for
this. And we know the creature has been shedding

03:53:20.369 --> 03:53:27.132
"scales in places where jets of ever-burning flame
now spark and burn the city itself. Wherever each

03:53:27.132 --> 03:53:35.272
"one of these scales falls, it seems to be a beacon
or source of its own white-hot fire. So the city

03:53:35.272 --> 03:53:50.522
"is now a pitfall of its own right. The creature
itself, the dragon, it has these jets that now

03:53:50.522 --> 03:53:56.473
"burst from underneath its armor, fire that licks
beyond it. It has a crest of red crystals now that

03:53:56.473 --> 03:54:07.841
"begin to twist behind its horns and head, its eyes
are like white-hot stars from the sky, it's...

03:54:07.841 --> 03:54:16.438
"It's still dragon-like, but something more primal
and elemental. (sighs) I'm not entirely certain

03:54:16.438 --> 03:54:25.526
"what we're dealing with here. But Brom, you've
made some headway." And Brom clears his throat.

03:54:25.526 --> 03:54:36.205
"(ahem) Myself and a few devout have been doing
our best to prepare surviving warriors and guards,

03:54:36.205 --> 03:54:42.318
"and mages who were ousted from the Lyceum; we have
a few strike teams that have been effective in

03:54:42.318 --> 03:54:49.680
"harrying the outside of his defenses, learning
information we can, knocking down the guardians.

03:54:49.680 --> 03:54:54.152
"Since the fire giants have arrived it's been a
little more difficult, so we've been reduced to

03:54:54.152 --> 03:55:03.784
"stealth missions, quick in and out. We don't have
the muscle to assault head-on. Up until recently."

03:55:03.784 --> 03:55:08.205
His eyes pass over to you. "You say there are
armies making their way to the city, and we have

03:55:08.205 --> 03:55:16.114
"you, all the strength that you've gained and the
stories I've heard from people here at Whitestone.

03:55:16.114 --> 03:55:25.181
"If we're going to do something, we need to do it
soon. Now, the Lyceum has fallen to those that

03:55:25.181 --> 03:55:35.068
"have sworn fealty to the Cinder King, so we don't
have use of those artifacts anymore. We've been

03:55:35.068 --> 03:55:40.543
"trying to break through to the inner sanctum of
the Cloudtop, what the dragon now calls its home,

03:55:40.543 --> 03:55:54.122
"its lair. It's burrowed this deep, underground
basin where it resides now. It only emerges when

03:55:54.122 --> 03:55:59.193
"summoned or called to, or when it decides to make
a proclamation, drawing what little bit of

03:55:59.193 --> 03:56:07.992
"children or families that it sees as a fun bit of
play to watch them bow and quiver in the street

03:56:07.992 --> 03:56:16.320
"before asking for someone to prove their strength
and their worship of himself and strike them where

03:56:16.320 --> 03:56:24.813
"they stand. Some days he's angry, some days he's
laughing; this dragon is completely insane, we

03:56:24.813 --> 03:56:32.002
"can't really gauge. Red dragons are known for
pride, and you could count on that, use it against

03:56:32.002 --> 03:56:40.335
"them, but sometimes his jaws quiver as he cries and
shakes and yells out laughing into the sky, a

03:56:40.397 --> 03:56:49.110
"terrible laughter, one that can induce the worst
of nightmares. I don't know what we're dealing

03:56:49.110 --> 03:57:01.470
"with anymore. However. We did have one team, a
very brave team, that provoked the dragon to leave

03:57:01.470 --> 03:57:15.149
"its lair, and held it long enough for us to move
past it and pierce the inside of its sanctum. Now,

03:57:15.149 --> 03:57:24.752
"we passed the wards, and the pools of fire. The
beast returned before we could get too far, and I

03:57:24.752 --> 03:57:35.863
"lost most of my men, myself barely surviving with
my life, and the scars to tell of it. But the

03:57:35.863 --> 03:57:44.537
"beast is building something in that lair.
Something it is guarding fiercely. And something

03:57:44.537 --> 03:57:56.059
"that it will not leave. Something that I think it
has come to hold more dear than the city it now

03:57:56.059 --> 03:58:07.075
"presides over. If there is a key to piercing its
pride, or if there is a reason to take it down, I

03:58:07.075 --> 03:58:19.018
"begin to fear what it's holding below the city.
Now, by the might of the Wounded Mistress of

03:58:19.018 --> 03:58:27.063
"Knowledge, Ioun, in the channels in which we
speak, that is all the information I have. I hope

03:58:27.063 --> 03:58:36.742
"it's helped in some way." And he sits down in his
chair and clutches his holy symbol.

03:58:36.742 --> 03:58:38.051
LAURA: Oh, my god.

03:58:38.051 --> 03:58:39.411
TALIESIN: This changes much.

03:58:39.411 --> 03:58:40.773
MARISHA: Yes, it does.

03:58:40.773 --> 03:58:56.388
LIAM: Dragon. You're awfully quiet. We need to
act. What do you advise?

03:58:56.388 --> 03:59:00.650
MATT: Raishan's head slowly turns towards you and
the nostrils kind of, (snort). Not in an

03:59:00.650 --> 03:59:08.949
aggressive way, but in acknowledgement. The bright
yellowish eyes, you can see the blackened veins

03:59:08.949 --> 03:59:12.880
that curl up past the scales, some of the scales
actually splitting and pulling open what you can

03:59:12.880 --> 03:59:26.219
see would be some sort of a contagion-based wound
that, while not infected, does not look positive.

03:59:26.219 --> 03:59:39.381
Raishan's lips curl up, and the voice billows
forth, a low, curling growl. "Well. If the madness

03:59:39.381 --> 03:59:49.119
"continues to spread, and our recent conversations
confirm this, you've gathered your allies.

03:59:49.119 --> 03:59:56.301
"Distraction. Attack. Confusion. Chaos, striking
towards the center of the city is the best chance

03:59:56.301 --> 04:00:11.385
"we have. If we have a way in, to break the
Cloudtop, we can battle it there, draw it from its

04:00:11.385 --> 04:00:19.627
"lair. Force it to possibly rescind within, and
have our final battle there. Or, if luck is with

04:00:19.627 --> 04:00:26.221
"us, finish it on the streets itself, and discover
whatever it is it's keeping while it lies dead and

04:00:26.221 --> 04:00:27.891
"burning in the street."

04:00:27.891 --> 04:00:29.196
LIAM: You say "we"?

04:00:29.196 --> 04:00:32.834
LAURA: You'll fight alongside us?

04:00:32.834 --> 04:00:36.234
MATT: "What have I to gain by watching you do this
yourself?"

04:00:36.397 --> 04:00:43.043
MARISHA: I imagine whatever he's building. What is
he building, do you know?

04:00:43.043 --> 04:00:46.676
MATT: "I have no idea. He lets nothing within his
sanctum."

04:00:46.676 --> 04:00:47.848
MARISHA: Insight check!

04:00:47.848 --> 04:00:49.298
MATT: Make an insight check.

04:00:49.298 --> 04:00:52.263
TRAVIS: Come on, high insight.

04:00:52.263 --> 04:00:54.849
MARISHA: What was that? That's okay, 23.

04:00:54.849 --> 04:00:56.407
MATT: 23?

04:00:56.407 --> 04:01:09.138
SAM: (gasps) Whispers... The promo link is
lootcrate.com/criticalrole, promo code

04:01:09.138 --> 04:01:15.679
criticalrole for ten percent off your first month
and remember, you're doing this to support the

04:01:15.679 --> 04:01:22.765
show, and to support my kid's pre-school class.
And the memory of Dennis.

04:01:22.765 --> 04:01:24.020
LAURA: And Coachella.

04:01:24.020 --> 04:01:30.831
LIAM: Coachella needs capoeira classes.

04:01:30.831 --> 04:01:37.160
(laughter)

04:01:37.160 --> 04:01:43.866
TALIESIN: We should also probably tell them about
Xanthas, that we did have...

04:01:43.866 --> 04:01:46.647
SAM: Tell who about Xanthas?

04:01:46.647 --> 04:01:48.277
TALIESIN: The room.

04:01:48.277 --> 04:01:52.467
SAM: Oh. Well, there was a guy named Xanthas, we
killed him, he was a dick, what's there to tell?

04:01:52.467 --> 04:01:55.733
TALIESIN: There is worth telling, is that
he had already turned and was working

04:01:55.941 --> 04:01:56.945
for the Cinder King.

04:01:56.945 --> 04:01:58.628
SAM: Keyleth.

04:01:58.628 --> 04:02:02.927
TALIESIN: And he is now no longer with us.

04:02:02.927 --> 04:02:16.314
LAURA: Brom? Do you know Osysa? The sphinx?

04:02:16.314 --> 04:02:24.066
MATT: Thinks for a minute. "I do not know of this
sphinx. I am sorry."

04:02:24.066 --> 04:02:27.541
LAURA: There's a temple to Ioun in Vasselheim.

04:02:27.541 --> 04:02:30.290
MATT: There is a temple to Ioun? In Vasselheim?

04:02:30.290 --> 04:02:32.276
LAURA: There is.

04:02:32.276 --> 04:02:36.021
MATT: "That is good. Many temples have fallen
and hidden through the years since our

04:02:36.021 --> 04:02:39.129
"mistress was wounded."

04:02:39.129 --> 04:02:43.621
LAURA: You would have no way of contacting it?

04:02:43.621 --> 04:02:50.140
MATT: "I can beseech my mistress for information.
But short of travelling to Vasselheim which I have

04:02:50.140 --> 04:03:07.008
"not been to, I cannot help you. I apologise, since
the Calamity, during the struggle with Tharizdun,

04:03:07.008 --> 04:03:17.304
"my mistress was grievously wounded in the
struggle, and since then has been diminished. And

04:03:17.304 --> 04:03:23.317
"in this time many of those that seek to lessen her
hold on the world and the spread of the

04:03:23.317 --> 04:03:29.107
"information and knowledge that we wish to share
have then hunted and persecuted those of us that

04:03:29.107 --> 04:03:37.007
"follow in her wake. So the temples have been
buried or kept in distributed information through

04:03:37.007 --> 04:03:45.931
"anonymous channels. Only a few of us in positions
of protection can speak out so strongly. This..."

04:03:45.931 --> 04:03:52.921
Surprisingly, he turns back towards the ziggurat.
"This was one such temple."

04:03:52.921 --> 04:03:54.943
MARISHA: What?

04:03:54.943 --> 04:03:56.957
LAURA: Yeah, that's right, this was a temple to
Ioun, we knew that.

04:03:56.957 --> 04:04:02.761
MARISHA: Right, right, okay. So wait, Tharizdun?

04:04:02.761 --> 04:04:05.970
MATT: "Tharizdun, the Chained Oblivion."

04:04:05.970 --> 04:04:07.468
MARISHA: Is that another god?

04:04:07.468 --> 04:04:13.598
MATT: "Yes, a very evil one. Sealed, chained
away. Nothing you need to worry about. Not in

04:04:13.598 --> 04:04:18.087
"the midst of this."

04:04:18.087 --> 04:04:20.415
TALIESIN: We're going to have to go to Emon.

04:04:20.415 --> 04:04:21.431
LAURA: Well, yeah.

04:04:21.431 --> 04:04:28.004
SAM: Sure. We'll rally all the troops outside and
maybe go in through the tunnels? I guess when we

04:04:28.004 --> 04:04:31.609
rally the troops we can form a more specific
plan.

04:04:31.609 --> 04:04:35.392
TALIESIN: There will be several armies, we will
have allies. There will be troops to create

04:04:35.392 --> 04:04:40.355
distractions, there will be troops that go into
the tunnels, there will probably be a group of

04:04:40.355 --> 04:04:46.340
troops that go in to try and pierce the lair. We
will create chaos.

04:04:46.340 --> 04:04:49.972
SAM: Ooh, did the airship ever show up?

04:04:49.972 --> 04:04:55.941
MATT: Cassandra says "Yes, the airship has been
told to make its way towards Fort Daxio."

04:04:55.941 --> 04:04:58.356
SAM: Oh that's good! Oh wait. Well, you know.

04:04:58.356 --> 04:05:00.257
TALIESIN: It could actually pick up the people
there.

04:05:00.257 --> 04:05:02.545
SAM: Sure, yeah.

04:05:02.545 --> 04:05:07.356
TRAVIS: Do we want to do a last trip to Vasselheim
to talk to Osysa or... since we got all the Vestiges?

04:05:07.356 --> 04:05:10.786
SAM: To do what? It's not all the Vestiges in the
world?

04:05:10.786 --> 04:05:12.345
LAURA: No, all the ones she told us about.

04:05:12.345 --> 04:05:14.063
TRAVIS: She was like, if you get these then 
I will help you.

04:05:14.063 --> 04:05:15.636
SAM: Oh really? She said that?

04:05:15.706 --> 04:05:17.480
LAURA: Did she say that?

04:05:17.480 --> 04:05:19.470
TRAVIS: Did she say that?

04:05:19.470 --> 04:05:20.760
MARISHA: Did she say that?

04:05:20.760 --> 04:05:22.667
LAURA: Do we remember her saying anything like
that?

04:05:22.667 --> 04:05:24.480
MATT: Well you didn't learn about the Vestiges
until it was--

04:05:24.480 --> 04:05:26.702
LAURA: It was from her hubby, her boyfriend.

04:05:26.702 --> 04:05:28.116
MATT: Yeah, Kamaljiori, it was, yeah.

04:05:28.116 --> 04:05:29.815
TRAVIS: Yeah, that name.

04:05:29.815 --> 04:05:31.517
LAURA: The one that said a name is earned.

04:05:31.517 --> 04:05:32.624
MATT: Yes.

04:05:32.624 --> 04:05:37.643
LAURA: Do we need to go to him?

04:05:37.643 --> 04:05:39.429
TRAVIS: It's a sphinx.

04:05:39.429 --> 04:05:42.215
LAURA: Was there anybody that said they would help
us once we got all the Vestiges? I feel like they

04:05:42.215 --> 04:05:45.047
said that once we got all the Vestiges we'd be
like extra awesome.

04:05:45.047 --> 04:05:46.697
SAM: We are extra awesome.

04:05:46.697 --> 04:05:48.260
LAURA: Well, yeah, yeah, yeah.

04:05:48.260 --> 04:05:51.597
MARISHA: I mean, there's some-- I feel like
there's not some sort of Voltron thing considering

04:05:51.597 --> 04:05:54.984
there are more vestiges in the world.

04:05:54.984 --> 04:05:58.839
TRAVIS: You lack imagination.

04:05:58.839 --> 04:06:01.720
SAM: Quick, let's try to fit all of our Vestiges
together right now.

04:06:01.720 --> 04:06:05.070
LAURA: Okay, let's do it.

04:06:05.070 --> 04:06:07.200
SAM: I just stab at Pike.

04:06:07.200 --> 04:06:08.876
LAURA: Ow ow ow ow.

04:06:08.876 --> 04:06:10.719
ASHLEY: I don't feel anything.

04:06:10.719 --> 04:06:13.102
TRAVIS: Does anything happen when they're all
touching?

04:06:13.102 --> 04:06:16.948
(laughter)

04:06:16.948 --> 04:06:21.278
MATT: You take all the Vestiges and and smush them
into a pile on the central table and all the rest

04:06:21.278 --> 04:06:22.849
of the council kind of--

04:06:22.849 --> 04:06:24.351
LAURA: Oh, it's not magic down here

04:06:24.351 --> 04:06:29.767
MATT: --look curiously and they all gather around
as you begin to place them all into the central

04:06:29.767 --> 04:06:34.965
area, kind of overlapping in almost the shape of a
person who is built of Vestiges. You put them each

04:06:34.965 --> 04:06:39.736
one down, their kind of magical essence clinging
with the surface of the stone table.

04:06:39.736 --> 04:06:41.610
LAURA: There's no magic down here!

04:06:41.610 --> 04:06:44.090
LIAM: I just lie down across the entire table.

04:06:44.090 --> 04:06:50.898
MATT: All right, the sound of them impacting. They
all sit there on the table.

04:06:50.898 --> 04:06:53.251
LIAM: They don't stick to my armor somehow?

04:06:53.251 --> 04:06:54.214
MATT: No.

04:06:54.214 --> 04:06:57.512
TRAVIS: You gotta say a word.

04:06:57.512 --> 04:07:02.660
MATT: Everyone's kind of standing there watching
quietly as nothing happens, and then Asum goes,

04:07:02.660 --> 04:07:05.017
"All right then, um."

04:07:05.017 --> 04:07:08.672
SAM: Maybe you should put your armor back on,
Pike.

04:07:08.672 --> 04:07:10.236
ASHLEY: I mean, I have underclothes.

04:07:10.236 --> 04:07:11.978
SAM: Okay.

04:07:11.978 --> 04:07:17.050
MATT: Yeah, we had that discussion. You need
things beneath the armor or it'll cut you to shit.

04:07:17.093 --> 04:07:20.435
ASHLEY: Just like bareback armor.

04:07:20.435 --> 04:07:24.221
MATT: That'd be a bad idea. You'd get pinched in
all the wrong places.

04:07:24.221 --> 04:07:27.915
TALIESIN: We do have-- Well, we do have our own
tunnel into the city that we can show-- Is anybody

04:07:27.915 --> 04:07:30.453
using our tunnels into the city?

04:07:30.453 --> 04:07:37.814
SAM: The Clasp? Oh you mean our specifically? Last
time I scryed there, there was someone in the keep.

04:07:37.859 --> 04:07:39.229
LAURA: Can you scry there now?

04:07:39.229 --> 04:07:41.162
SAM: No.

04:07:41.162 --> 04:07:42.595
MARISHA: Wait, weren't they--

04:07:42.595 --> 04:07:47.990
LAURA: Oh yeah, Keyleth! Can you scry? Not down
here. We have to leave the ziggurat.

04:07:47.990 --> 04:07:49.882
MARISHA: I've got the Scrying Eye.

04:07:49.882 --> 04:07:54.462
TALIESIN: If the keep is clear, that does give us
access. Possibly clear access.

04:07:54.462 --> 04:07:56.798
LAURA: We could bamf into the keep.

04:07:56.798 --> 04:07:59.254
SAM: Yeah, that just gets us inside the wall. That
doesn't-- that's it.

04:07:59.254 --> 04:08:01.433
LIAM: That's not nothing.

04:08:01.433 --> 04:08:03.363
SAM: The sewers is where we need to be.

04:08:03.363 --> 04:08:11.521
LIAM: It connects. That'll get us under the wall.
What about-- What about Cashew? What about Shaun?

04:08:11.521 --> 04:08:13.583
What about Zahra?

04:08:13.583 --> 04:08:16.090
MARISHA: Cashew's kinda mad at us.

04:08:16.090 --> 04:08:20.729
LIAM: Yeah, I'm sure he is, but this the end of
times.

04:08:20.729 --> 04:08:26.060
MATT: Cassandra kind of raises her hand and goes,
"Kashaw and Zahra, they are ready to go whenever

04:08:26.060 --> 04:08:26.865
you are ready."

04:08:26.865 --> 04:08:28.852
LAURA: Sweet.

04:08:28.852 --> 04:08:29.672
LIAM: Shaun?

04:08:29.672 --> 04:08:34.621
MATT: "Shaun we've -- we're trying to decide if it
is best to keep someone here to maintain the

04:08:34.657 --> 04:08:38.703
"barrier, or if we are going all in on
this, if we just send everyone out there

04:08:38.703 --> 04:08:40.912
"and leave the city defenseless."

04:08:40.912 --> 04:08:43.912
SAM: I think it's best to leave him here,
especially since that was his plan all along,

04:08:43.912 --> 04:08:48.014
because he is a dominator of all worlds and a god
among men.

04:08:48.014 --> 04:08:55.973
MATT: Allura raises her hand and goes, "Either I
or Shaun can run the barrier; you can decide. I

04:08:55.973 --> 04:09:03.209
"don't mind staying back or going to the forefront.
It's your choice which one of us to take."

04:09:03.209 --> 04:09:07.510
TRAVIS: Can Gilmore transport people like you
can?

04:09:07.510 --> 04:09:10.151
MATT: "I believe he can, yes."

04:09:10.151 --> 04:09:12.063
TRAVIS: I like Gilmore.

04:09:12.063 --> 04:09:14.679
LIAM: For what? For keeping him alive or taking
him?

04:09:14.679 --> 04:09:20.223
TRAVIS: No, bringing him with. Dude, he turned that
guy into a little pretzel dough ball. Just because

04:09:20.266 --> 04:09:21.699
he fucked with him.

04:09:21.699 --> 04:09:23.695
MARISHA: But Allura can teleport us back and
forth.

04:09:23.695 --> 04:09:24.873
TRAVIS: Yeah, so can he.

04:09:24.873 --> 04:09:26.600
MARISHA: Can he?

04:09:26.600 --> 04:09:35.265
TRAVIS: That's what he just said.

04:09:35.265 --> 04:09:38.278
TALIESIN: Allura signed up for this fight.

04:09:38.278 --> 04:09:44.605
LIAM: Yeah, Allura, what do you want to do?

04:09:44.605 --> 04:09:50.167
MATT: "It's interesting. I have a lot of personal
history with Thordak. I feel a deep sense of

04:09:50.167 --> 04:09:56.572
"responsibility for all of this that still eats
away at me. And because of that a part of me

04:09:56.572 --> 04:10:07.692
"really longs to be there with all of you, putting
this dark and fiery chapter to rest. On the other

04:10:07.692 --> 04:10:13.573
"hand, having already faced him, and having an
inkling of what he is now, every part of me wants

04:10:13.573 --> 04:10:16.873
"to run away. Screaming."

04:10:16.873 --> 04:10:19.130
LIAM: But you have faced him.

04:10:19.130 --> 04:10:20.396
MATT: "I have."

04:10:20.396 --> 04:10:22.176
LIAM: And that's invaluable.

04:10:22.176 --> 04:10:26.340
MATT: "I lost many good people in doing so."

04:10:26.340 --> 04:10:29.005
TALIESIN: And we're going to lose many more.

04:10:29.005 --> 04:10:36.728
MATT: "Most likely. So the choice is yours, Vox
Machina."

04:10:36.728 --> 04:10:38.076
TRAVIS: Gilmore.

04:10:38.076 --> 04:10:45.456
(laughing)

04:10:45.456 --> 04:10:48.603
TRAVIS: No offense. You're lovely and very
strong.

04:10:48.603 --> 04:10:52.683
MATT: You watch her audibly (sighs).

04:10:52.683 --> 04:10:54.899
LAURA: Is that relief? That was relief.

04:10:54.899 --> 04:11:00.558
MATT: It's both. It's a lot of things. It's an
emotionally conflicted exhale, but it is a relief

04:11:00.558 --> 04:11:03.615
of tension regardless.

04:11:03.615 --> 04:11:19.097
LIAM: I disagree. You fought this fucking thing
before. You know him. That is invaluable. You have

04:11:19.097 --> 04:11:26.946
more experience than we do. You're wiser than us.

04:11:26.946 --> 04:11:29.407
MARISHA: Scanlan? What do you think?

04:11:29.407 --> 04:11:31.647
SAM: I think we should decide this the way we
always do.

04:11:31.647 --> 04:11:32.704
LIAM: Coin toss?

04:11:32.704 --> 04:11:34.535
SAM: Talk about it for a long, long time.

04:11:34.535 --> 04:11:39.168
(laughter)

04:11:39.168 --> 04:11:42.858
MATT: That's D&amp;amp;D, man.

04:11:42.858 --> 04:11:44.027
SAM: Let's put it to a vote.

04:11:44.027 --> 04:11:45.877
LIAM: Experience. Experience.

04:11:45.877 --> 04:11:53.283
SAM: A voice vote. All in favor of Gilmore, say,
"Hell yeah." All in favor of Allura, say, "Ah,

04:11:53.283 --> 04:11:55.077
"sure, sure." Right?

04:11:55.077 --> 04:11:56.606
SAM: Gilmore?

04:11:56.606 --> 04:11:57.767
SAM, ASHLEY, TRAVIS: Hell yeah!

04:11:57.767 --> 04:11:59.467
SAM: Oh, just us. Allura?

04:11:59.467 --> 04:12:00.837
SAM, TALIESIN, LIAM, MARISHA: Ah, sure.

04:12:00.837 --> 04:12:03.366
(laughter)

04:12:03.366 --> 04:12:04.536
TRAVIS: But that was three and three. What'd you
vote?

04:12:04.536 --> 04:12:06.287
ASHLEY: I voted Gilmore.

04:12:06.287 --> 04:12:07.278
TRAVIS: That's four.

04:12:07.278 --> 04:12:12.810
LIAM: I don't know what would happen. So: Gilmore,
Gilmore...

04:12:12.875 --> 04:12:14.080
TRAVIS: Four and three.

04:12:14.080 --> 04:12:15.397
TALIESIN: Gilmore doesn't want to go either.

04:12:15.397 --> 04:12:18.481
ASHLEY: Neither of them want to go, but she's so
scared now.

04:12:18.481 --> 04:12:23.387
MARISHA: Allura. Hang on, wait, I'm talking to
her. I'm not voting; I'm talking to her.

04:12:23.387 --> 04:12:25.233
(laughter)

04:12:25.233 --> 04:12:27.333
SAM: "Allura! I vote for Gilmore."

04:12:27.333 --> 04:12:29.509
(laughter)

04:12:29.509 --> 04:12:32.423
TALIESIN: Unless Gilmore feels like volunteering.

04:12:32.423 --> 04:12:44.351
MARISHA: Allura, I have had destiny pushed upon me
since birth. What do you feel is right? Because

04:12:44.351 --> 04:12:46.191
I'm not sure what to believe anymore.

04:12:46.191 --> 04:12:47.932
LAURA: Make this decision for us!

04:12:47.932 --> 04:12:50.067
MARISHA: Make this decision for us!

04:12:50.067 --> 04:12:51.790
SAM: Hey, let's leave it to the dice!

04:12:51.790 --> 04:12:58.717
MATT: Allura turns to you, kind of takes the side
of your head in her hands and says, "And in

04:12:58.717 --> 04:13:08.008
"becoming a leader, you've been put in a position
to make very difficult choices. As you grow as a

04:13:08.008 --> 04:13:14.437
"leader, you'll have to make many more. This is not
my choice to make."

04:13:14.437 --> 04:13:16.499
MARISHA: But in many ways you've been our
leader--

04:13:16.499 --> 04:13:17.985
(laughter)

04:13:17.985 --> 04:13:21.132
SAM: We already voted, people! And Gilmore won!

04:13:21.132 --> 04:13:24.270
TALIESIN: No, actually, Allura won.

04:13:24.270 --> 04:13:27.085
MATT: "Who do you choose?"

04:13:27.085 --> 04:13:28.720
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's four to three.

04:13:28.720 --> 04:13:30.648
LIAM: Well, then, it's covered. Then it's done.

04:13:30.648 --> 04:13:31.760
MATT: "Keyleth."

04:13:31.760 --> 04:13:33.539
TALIESIN: All right.

04:13:33.539 --> 04:13:39.148
LIAM: Unless you do what Laura and Marisha did and
do the exact opposite after the vote. Right? Come

04:13:39.148 --> 04:13:40.681
on, Allura.

04:13:40.681 --> 04:13:42.850
MARISHA: Wait, are you trying to use this as an
allegory?.

04:13:42.850 --> 04:13:46.735
LIAM: No. That's just a throwback to, what
episode...?

04:13:46.735 --> 04:13:48.766
MATT: At this point, Raishan picks up and goes--

04:13:48.766 --> 04:13:50.800
MARISHA: Oh. Clarota?

04:13:50.800 --> 04:13:55.186
MATT: "Oh, god, at the rate this is going, I think
perhaps neither of them are going to make it."

04:13:55.186 --> 04:13:56.701
LAURA: Yeah. Sorry about that.

04:13:56.701 --> 04:13:58.090
SAM: Trial by combat.

04:13:58.090 --> 04:14:01.297
(laughter)

04:14:01.297 --> 04:14:03.179
MATT: The survivor goes to Emon!

04:14:03.179 --> 04:14:04.503
LAURA: I mean, is Gilmore strong enough?

04:14:04.503 --> 04:14:06.460
MARISHA: Yeah, is he strong enough? Is he all
right?

04:14:06.460 --> 04:14:09.969
TRAVIS: We'll rest him up; he'll be great. Pretzel
dough ball. It's gonna be amazing.

04:14:09.969 --> 04:14:16.182
MATT: "Last I checked, he's handling the barrier,
but he's a capable man. May need a bit of rest,

04:14:16.182 --> 04:14:20.534
"but so did you."

04:14:20.534 --> 04:14:25.813
SAM: Quick stop to get his parents' permission,
then we're on our way.

04:14:25.813 --> 04:14:26.957
MARISHA: Allura.

04:14:26.957 --> 04:14:28.172
SAM: Wait, what? What happened?

04:14:28.172 --> 04:14:29.223
LIAM: She's talking to her.

04:14:29.223 --> 04:14:40.154
MARISHA: Fucking god dammit, you guys. I'm not
making votes here! In many ways, I feel--

04:14:40.154 --> 04:14:41.718
(laughing)

04:14:41.718 --> 04:14:42.719
MARISHA: What?

04:14:42.719 --> 04:14:44.210
TRAVIS: We're taking Gilmore.

04:14:44.210 --> 04:14:45.910
LAURA: No, she's talking to her!

04:14:45.910 --> 04:14:48.676
LIAM: She's not trying to take her. She's talking
about something else.

04:14:48.676 --> 04:14:56.406
MARISHA: Jesus Christ.

04:14:56.406 --> 04:15:00.902
MATT: There are a few chuckles at the table now,
as everyone is just dumbfoundedly watching you all

04:15:00.902 --> 04:15:03.491
argue over who to take for five minutes.

04:15:03.491 --> 04:15:04.318
LIAM: Vox Machina.

04:15:04.318 --> 04:15:06.265
MATT: Vox Machina.

04:15:06.265 --> 04:15:13.594
MARISHA: In many ways, I feel we are walking down
the path you've already walked. In that case, I

04:15:13.594 --> 04:15:21.454
feel it's time for new blood, and we've been with
Gilmore since the beginning. We need you as an

04:15:21.454 --> 04:15:33.974
ally back here, we'll keep you on the sidelines as
an oracle, and we'll take Gilmore to be by our side.

04:15:33.974 --> 04:15:38.689
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's what we said
already.

04:15:38.689 --> 04:15:43.940
MARISHA: Look, he set me up to make the call,
okay! I was trying to follow through, Jesus.

04:15:43.940 --> 04:15:45.726
ASHLEY: You got it, Keyleth.

04:15:45.726 --> 04:15:48.519
LIAM: Smash cut to Gilmore saying, "No fucking
way!"

04:15:48.519 --> 04:15:59.945
MATT: "I'm not going, what are you talking about?!
No! That's suicide! They make me baguettes every

04:15:59.945 --> 04:16:02.767
"morning in Whitestone. I'm staying here."

04:16:02.813 --> 04:16:09.463
(laughter)

04:16:09.463 --> 04:16:15.794
Allura kind of nods and goes, "Very well. I'll
send Kima as well. All the strength that we have

04:16:15.794 --> 04:16:20.535
"in your direction. I'll stay here and play
guardian of Whitestone, as I have for quite some

04:16:20.535 --> 04:16:30.971
"time." She looks to Cassandra, looks to Raishan,
everyone else, they all kind of nod and Cassandra

04:16:31.041 --> 04:16:38.604
stands up, holds her collar and-- it's interesting
in moments like these that such a young girl still

04:16:38.604 --> 04:16:45.006
carries the weight of a room like this, of such
giants by comparison to her and still can command

04:16:45.006 --> 04:16:51.974
attention so quickly with a subtle physicality.
And then she adjusts her collar a bit and raises

04:16:51.974 --> 04:17:02.930
her chin. "And so it is. Vox Machina, we gather
our forces. Put your minds together. Decide on

04:17:02.977 --> 04:17:12.934
"your plan of action, your means of attack. Soon we
begin the assault on Emon."

04:17:12.934 --> 04:17:18.780
And that's where we'll end our episode for
tonight.

04:17:18.780 --> 04:17:25.023
SAM: At dawn, we vote!

04:17:25.023 --> 04:17:31.212
MARISHA: I demand a recount! In Pennsylvania and
Florida specifically.

04:17:31.212 --> 04:17:33.136
LIAM: You know, Gilmore won the popular vote.

04:17:33.136 --> 04:17:38.422
(laughter)

04:17:38.422 --> 04:17:44.897
MATT: You guys, thank you very much. We're on the
home stretch, it looks like.

04:17:44.897 --> 04:17:46.820
LAURA: Oh my god.

04:17:46.820 --> 04:17:54.032
MATT: Man. All right. You guys have a week to plan
amongst yourselves what to do next time.

04:17:54.032 --> 04:17:57.201
MARISHA: Are we assuming that we're sleeping after
this? Because god damn.

04:17:57.201 --> 04:17:59.068
ASHLEY: We already just slept.

04:17:59.068 --> 04:18:01.478
MARISHA: That's right, because we bamfed to
Whitestone. Never mind.

04:18:01.478 --> 04:18:07.269
MATT: Correct, yes, you've only used your spell
there. We will unfortunately not have a Travis

04:18:07.269 --> 04:18:10.823
Willingham next week, or Ashley Johnson.

04:18:10.823 --> 04:18:13.634
LAURA: Oh fuck. It's going to be an empty bench
over here.

04:18:13.634 --> 04:18:18.713
MATT: However, based on the gathering of allies
just for this battle, we may have a guest or two.

04:18:18.713 --> 04:18:22.399
(gasps)

04:18:22.399 --> 04:18:23.882
SAM: Gathering?

04:18:23.882 --> 04:18:25.174
MATT: You guys are gathering all your allies.

04:18:25.174 --> 04:18:28.024
SAM: As in, like, the Insane Clown Posse is
coming?

04:18:28.024 --> 04:18:30.019
MATT: Yeah man! The Dark Carnival's here!

04:18:30.019 --> 04:18:32.681
(laughter)

04:18:32.681 --> 04:18:34.130
SAM: Next week on Critical Role.

04:18:34.130 --> 04:18:36.025
MATT: Just start spraying Faygo all over you
guys.

04:18:36.025 --> 04:18:41.162
LAURA: Wait, it's happening next week?
We're going into battle? We don't have

04:18:41.162 --> 04:18:44.182
Travis and Ashley?

04:18:44.182 --> 04:18:45.759
TALIESIN: Shit's happening.

04:18:45.759 --> 04:18:48.489
LIAM: Dude, that city's probably like the nine
circles of Hell, we're not just going to get

04:18:48.489 --> 04:18:51.006
there, fast track to Thordak.

04:18:51.006 --> 04:18:52.605
LAURA: Okay okay okay.

04:18:52.605 --> 04:18:57.634
TRAVIS: If you got Lin Manuel next week, I will
kill you.

04:18:57.634 --> 04:19:00.392
LAURA: No, it's not, don't say-- no it's not.

04:19:00.392 --> 04:19:02.894
MATT: I wish, I wish, that'd be great.

04:19:02.894 --> 04:19:05.159
TRAVIS: I'm just putting it out there, I don't
want to have to kill you.

04:19:05.159 --> 04:19:08.524
MATT: All right, cool.

04:19:08.524 --> 04:19:09.738
TRAVIS: Thank you, Loot Crate!

04:19:09.738 --> 04:19:14.202
MATT: Thank you Loot Crate, again, for being a
great sponsor. Thank you guys so much for watching

04:19:14.202 --> 04:19:22.341
tonight, we'll see you Tuesday at Talks Machina,
and Thursday for the continuation of this

04:19:22.341 --> 04:19:29.422
climactic downwards spiral into ancient red dragon
territory.

04:19:29.422 --> 04:19:31.506
LIAM: This bullet-proof think-tank.

04:19:31.506 --> 04:19:35.513
MATT: Yeah, what could possibly go wrong? (laughs)
Anyway guys, have a wonderful week, a wonderful

04:19:35.513 --> 04:19:41.460
weekend, a wonderful evening, and is it Thursday
yet? Good night.
