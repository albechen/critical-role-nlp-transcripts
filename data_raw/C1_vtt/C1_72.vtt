[no audio]

00:20:51.170 --> 00:20:53.892
--break into a coughing fit at the
top of the game. You all right, Liam?

00:20:53.892 --> 00:20:57.771
LIAM: I said a bad word. I got the soap.

00:20:57.771 --> 00:21:03.654
MATT: That's called karma. First and foremost,
we're going to get through our announcements for

00:21:03.654 --> 00:21:08.347
the evening so we can hop into the game. First
off, tonight's awesome sponsor returning to us is

00:21:08.347 --> 00:21:09.871
Backblaze.

00:21:09.871 --> 00:21:18.673
SAM: Yeah, are we good, guys? Are we good? What's
going on over there? There's lots of people

00:21:18.673 --> 00:21:20.439
pulling out their hair.

00:21:20.439 --> 00:21:22.873
OFFSCREEN: I think we're having sound issues.

00:21:22.873 --> 00:21:25.761
MATT: Okay. Hold on just a second.

00:21:25.761 --> 00:21:29.491
SAM: A lot of people doing this. (panicked
sounds)

00:21:29.491 --> 00:21:31.549
TRAVIS: Out of sync, is what they're saying.

00:21:31.549 --> 00:21:34.233
OFFSCREEN: All right, Twitch has sound.

00:21:34.233 --> 00:21:36.845
SAM: Twitch has sound? We're good to go?

00:21:36.845 --> 00:21:40.231
MATT: All righty. So Sam.

00:21:40.231 --> 00:21:47.146
SAM: Hi. You know, Backblaze is one of our top two
favorite sponsors.

00:21:47.146 --> 00:21:50.223
(laughter)

00:21:50.223 --> 00:21:55.530
SAM: We love them to death. They love us. They are
Critters. In fact, coming up later, you should

00:21:55.530 --> 00:21:59.826
tune in to the break to see their newest ad. It's
made for Critters by a Critter. Backblaze is

00:21:59.826 --> 00:22:03.724
unlimited cloud backup for Macs and PCs for just
five dollars a month. I actually use it. All my

00:22:03.724 --> 00:22:11.028
shit's backed up. Tonight, I prepared a word game
for all of you to compete. You have to buzz in.

00:22:11.028 --> 00:22:17.638
You have to give me the answer. I can give you two
clues, like two words, and you buzz in and tell me

00:22:17.638 --> 00:22:22.549
what the words are. Here's a hint. Here's a clue:
all the answers are the same. Okay, so like, for

00:22:22.549 --> 00:22:29.957
instance, if I were to say, the rear part of your
chest and what a fire does--

00:22:29.957 --> 00:22:31.425
LAURA: Backblaze.

00:22:31.425 --> 00:22:38.770
SAM: Backblaze, that's right. One point for Laura.
Okay. Here the game begins. The opposite color of

00:22:38.770 --> 00:22:41.284
white, and the topmost part of a helicopter.

00:22:41.284 --> 00:22:42.871
TRAVIS: Black blades!

00:22:42.871 --> 00:22:47.476
(laughter)

00:22:47.476 --> 00:22:53.022
SAM: Classical composer Johann Sebastian, and a
hairstyle made popular by Pippi Longstocking.

00:22:53.022 --> 00:22:55.439
LAURA: Bach braids!

00:22:55.439 --> 00:22:58.139
SAM: Laura Bailey. Two points.

00:22:58.139 --> 00:23:00.238
MARISHA: Is there a buzzer system?

00:23:00.238 --> 00:23:02.199
SAM: You just have to say it.

00:23:02.199 --> 00:23:08.339
Pages of paper bound together and a climbing
or rappel technique.

00:23:08.339 --> 00:23:10.382
TRAVIS: Binder rappel!

00:23:10.382 --> 00:23:14.697
LAURA: Brad! No.

00:23:14.697 --> 00:23:23.611
TRAVIS: Book rappel. Book belay. Book belay!
(laughs) I'm the smartest man alive!

00:23:23.611 --> 00:23:26.727
SAM: Is it two-to-two right now?

00:23:26.727 --> 00:23:29.045
LAURA: I thought pages binded together. I was
going to say brad.

00:23:29.045 --> 00:23:37.335
SAM: Okay, this is not a real game. I invented
this on the drive over! Okay, one more. You know

00:23:37.335 --> 00:23:44.666
what? You guys aren't playing anymore. This is
between Laura and Travis. You know what? I'm going

00:23:44.666 --> 00:23:52.378
to do two more, just because I love them. Popular
Ben Folds Five song, and the abrasive sound a

00:23:52.378 --> 00:23:54.409
donkey makes.

00:23:54.409 --> 00:23:57.795
LIAM: Brick bray!

00:23:57.795 --> 00:24:14.971
SAM: Brick bray, yes! One more. One more. To get
stoned and to get stoned. It's bake blaze. Anyway,

00:24:14.971 --> 00:24:20.751
Bakeblaze is an unlimited cloud backup for Macs
and PCs. It can backup fanart, fanfic, music,

00:24:20.751 --> 00:24:24.551
photos, videos, drawings, documents, all of your
data. You can restore by mail. If you crash,

00:24:24.551 --> 00:24:28.950
they'll send you a hard drive. It's amazing. Go to
backblaze.com/criticalrole.

00:24:28.950 --> 00:24:31.342
(cheering)

00:24:31.342 --> 00:24:44.197
MATT: Thank you, Bakeblaze, for your sponsorship.
All right. Let me get through the next few

00:24:44.197 --> 00:24:48.881
announcements really quick, then. You guys got to
see a video before this that Geek and Sundry put

00:24:48.881 --> 00:24:54.832
together. It was a fun weekend shoot to talk about
the game Masquerada. I talked about it in previous

00:24:54.832 --> 00:24:59.776
episodes, but it's an awesome PC RPG. I am so in
love with the process of us putting this together.

00:24:59.776 --> 00:25:05.767
It's a great story, fantastic cast, incredible
writing, and very much hearkens to the isometric,

00:25:05.767 --> 00:25:10.800
Baldur's Gate, Planescape Torment-style RPG format
of the early 2000s. I highly recommend it. You

00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:18.265
should check it out. I think it's in Steam now,
and hope you like it. Next up, my first episode of

00:25:18.265 --> 00:25:25.747
the new GM Tips series is out today. It goes a
little behind my screen, and gives some ideas as

00:25:25.747 --> 00:25:31.915
to how you can set up your own GM circumstance and
experience. Mind you, most of it's just fluff. You

00:25:31.915 --> 00:25:35.737
don't need any of that to run a game. You can just
have books, dice, paper, and pens, and you're good

00:25:35.737 --> 00:25:41.163
to go. But these are just suggestions and an
example of the things that I do to run my game

00:25:41.163 --> 00:25:44.636
smoothly, and you should check it out if you'd
like it. New episodes will be coming out every

00:25:44.636 --> 00:25:49.514
Wednesday on Alpha, I suppose, and then on
Thursdays coming out on YouTube and the website

00:25:49.514 --> 00:25:50.587
proper.

00:25:50.587 --> 00:25:53.291
TRAVIS: Is it pronounced GM tips, or gmmm tips?

00:25:53.291 --> 00:26:00.537
MATT: Gmmm tips. They are now. It is now Matthew
Mercer's Gmmm Tips. Thank you, Travis.

00:26:00.537 --> 00:26:02.337
Disadvantage.

00:26:02.337 --> 00:26:04.663
(laughter)

00:26:04.663 --> 00:26:12.274
MATT: So check that out. Also, my last
announcement for me. There's a project up on

00:26:12.274 --> 00:26:19.581
Kickstarter right now called Open Legend RPG. It's
a cool new RPG system. Both myself and Ed

00:26:19.581 --> 00:26:24.719
Greenwood, the creator of Faerun and the Forgotten
Realms, are contributing to this project. It looks

00:26:24.719 --> 00:26:28.426
pretty cool, people involved are really nice, and
go ahead and check it out, see if it's your jam.

00:26:28.426 --> 00:26:33.669
And if it is, you should go ahead and help support
it, so check it out. It's Open Legend RPG. That's

00:26:33.669 --> 00:26:37.498
all my announcements. Does anybody else have
anything they want to talk about?

00:26:37.498 --> 00:26:40.630
LAURA: What about our Halloween costume
competition?

00:26:40.630 --> 00:26:41.989
SAM: Oh, yeah!

00:26:41.989 --> 00:26:46.617
LAURA: I've been seeing some of them. It's
Critical Costumes, is the hashtag, right?

00:26:46.617 --> 00:26:50.076
SAM: #CriticalCostumes. You explained the
competition?

00:26:50.076 --> 00:26:54.659
LAURA: Yeah. Next week, I think, is where we're
stopping. Halloween will be the last day?

00:26:54.659 --> 00:26:56.077
MARISHA: On Halloween.

00:26:56.077 --> 00:26:59.358
LAURA: Halloween's the last day to submit, and
then we're all just going to look at all your

00:26:59.358 --> 00:27:01.335
costumes and just decide who we like.

00:27:01.335 --> 00:27:04.956
MARISHA: I will say I had a cat dress up as my
character, so the bar is pretty high.

00:27:04.956 --> 00:27:09.130
LAURA: I saw a really amazing Vex today. I'm just
saying, I may be biased.

00:27:09.130 --> 00:27:11.477
SAM: So just to be clear, the winners are not
going to be announced next week. It's the week

00:27:11.477 --> 00:27:12.421
after.

00:27:12.421 --> 00:27:15.511
MATT: No, the week after. The first Thursday of
November, we'll be announcing the winners.

00:27:15.511 --> 00:27:19.062
SAM: We don't know what the prizes are. But it
will include my shirts.

00:27:19.062 --> 00:27:20.094
LIAM: Your sweaty shirts.

00:27:20.094 --> 00:27:21.790
LAURA: But not that shirt.

00:27:21.790 --> 00:27:28.458
SAM: Yeah, this is my shirt. Forever.

00:27:28.458 --> 00:27:35.990
MATT: One of these days, you're going to wake up,
put a shirt on, and the universe is going to fold

00:27:35.990 --> 00:27:46.163
in on you. I'm excited. All righty. Anything else?
All right, then. That being the case, let's go

00:27:46.163 --> 00:27:50.345
ahead and dive down into tonight's episode
of Critical Role.

00:27:50.345 --> 00:29:27.050
[dramatic music]

00:29:27.050 --> 00:29:28.528
MARISHA: --balanced breakfast!

00:29:28.528 --> 00:29:34.812
MATT: Welcome back, everyone. I just physically
ordered the other torch, so that'll be fixed soon.

00:29:34.812 --> 00:29:44.154
Because sometimes you just got to do it yourself.
Anyway, welcome back. So to continue from where we

00:29:44.154 --> 00:29:51.259
left off for tonight's episode of Critical Role,
Vox Machina, our heroic players and characters, in

00:29:51.259 --> 00:29:56.548
fighting their way across the land of Tal'Dorei
against the Chrome Conclave, a gathering of

00:29:56.548 --> 00:30:03.456
ancient chromatic dragons that have torn the
current civilization asunder. They've gathered a

00:30:03.456 --> 00:30:08.487
number of artifacts of old called the Vestiges of
Divergence and recently made allies with one of

00:30:08.487 --> 00:30:14.339
these dragons, Raishan, the green dragon of the
conclave, apparently interested in revolting

00:30:14.339 --> 00:30:21.374
against the conclave's leader, Thordak the Cinder
King. A tentative alliance has been forged and to

00:30:21.374 --> 00:30:27.705
prove both the stalwartness of that alliance, as
well as to further your agenda against the

00:30:27.705 --> 00:30:33.988
conclave, you all traveled back to Wildemount, to
the ruins of Draconia. With the help of the

00:30:33.988 --> 00:30:39.950
Ravenites you set a trap for Vorugal, the Frigid
Doom. You summoned, using your single Gate scroll,

00:30:39.950 --> 00:30:48.508
from the Abyss, Yenk the Goristro, a great,
powerful siege demon and caused it to battle with

00:30:48.508 --> 00:30:55.724
the white dragon. Partway through, the encounter
got more intense, you all rushed into the fray. Got

00:30:55.724 --> 00:31:01.728
the crap kicked out of you in a lot of cases but
when all was said and done, with the aid of

00:31:01.728 --> 00:31:05.878
Raishan, you felled Vorugal. The final shot being
landed by Vex'ahlia herself.

00:31:05.878 --> 00:31:07.808
LAURA: Thank you.

00:31:07.808 --> 00:31:16.547
MATT: You guys have now taken a moment. You've
discussed with Raishan to meet back in Whitestone,

00:31:16.547 --> 00:31:23.763
after which she reverted form and vanished. And
you've now begun to collect your spoils and gather

00:31:23.763 --> 00:31:31.370
what you can from the battlefield at this moment.
So that's where we pick up this week. What would

00:31:31.370 --> 00:31:33.502
you like to do?

00:31:33.554 --> 00:31:36.291
LIAM: Man, we've gotta find Larkin.

00:31:36.291 --> 00:31:40.169
LAURA: Did you have dragon bits you wanted to
gather?

00:31:40.169 --> 00:31:42.241
MARISHA: I did, very much so.

00:31:42.241 --> 00:31:44.129
TALIESIN: And some Yenk, I imagine.

00:31:44.129 --> 00:31:46.394
MARISHA: A little bit of Yenk, a little bit of
dragon.

00:31:46.394 --> 00:31:48.346
LAURA: I got a little Yenk blood
already.

00:31:48.346 --> 00:31:49.796
MATT: You did.

00:31:49.796 --> 00:31:51.283
LIAM: Brazen, guys.

00:31:51.283 --> 00:31:58.587
MATT: All right, so, you're heading to the dragon
or Yenk first?

00:31:58.587 --> 00:31:59.736
MARISHA: Dragon.

00:31:59.736 --> 00:32:01.396
MATT: Okay, so you head to the dragon.

00:32:01.396 --> 00:32:08.885
Okay. So you guys head over there. You now see
partially elements of the wall that had crumbled

00:32:08.885 --> 00:32:15.634
in on Vorugal's body. You see now, emerging from
the center of the scales in the chest as it lays

00:32:15.634 --> 00:32:22.564
on its back, slain, its throat torn out by
Raishan, a piercing tree begins to burrow its way

00:32:22.564 --> 00:32:29.532
through the torso of the dragon and bloom
outwards. Waiting for that process to finish, you

00:32:29.532 --> 00:32:32.008
bring out your carving dagger and--

00:32:32.008 --> 00:32:33.632
MARISHA: I patiently wait for the tree.

00:32:33.632 --> 00:32:34.456
MATT: Okay.

00:32:34.456 --> 00:32:35.951
MARISHA: I don't want to interrupt. That's rude.

00:32:35.951 --> 00:32:42.151
MATT: It grows pretty fast as part of the
enchantment of Fenthras. So, that brief pause

00:32:42.205 --> 00:32:51.307
completed, you go to town with your blade on the
dragon's corpse. Let's go ahead and make a check

00:32:51.307 --> 00:32:52.733
on this. This would be--

00:32:52.733 --> 00:32:53.653
MARISHA: Nature, right?

00:32:53.653 --> 00:32:54.600
MATT: Yeah.

00:32:54.600 --> 00:32:58.596
MARISHA: With advantage. Oh, that's good. 28.

00:32:58.596 --> 00:33:07.960
MATT: 28, okay. It'll take you the better part of
about an hour to really harvest everything you

00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:14.568
want from this that's usable, and that's with aid
from Scanlan, because it's a very big dragon, and

00:33:14.568 --> 00:33:20.535
that's a pretty small blade. So you begin that
process.

00:33:20.535 --> 00:33:29.386
LAURA: I can help. I want to go up and carve a
bear onto the tree growing out of Vorugal.

00:33:29.386 --> 00:33:35.210
TALIESIN: I may lend my cut-dragon-like-butter
blade to this whole process.

00:33:35.210 --> 00:33:36.695
MATT: Okay.

00:33:36.695 --> 00:33:40.649
SAM: Can I just pull off a scale? A single scale.
Is that really hard to do?

00:33:40.649 --> 00:33:43.596
MATT: Make a strength check.

00:33:43.596 --> 00:33:45.744
SAM: Two.

00:33:45.744 --> 00:33:51.530
MATT: You spend the next minute and a half going
(grunting sounds). It's not budging.

00:33:51.530 --> 00:33:53.020
SAM: It's actually three.

00:33:53.020 --> 00:33:57.750
MATT: Oh, the next minute and 20 seconds going
(grunting sounds).

00:33:57.750 --> 00:33:59.058
SAM: Great.

00:33:59.058 --> 00:34:03.626
MATT: You do manage to found a couple loose scales
on the ground nearby after you've thoroughly

00:34:03.626 --> 00:34:04.765
embarrassed yourself.

00:34:04.765 --> 00:34:11.877
SAM: I'll grab one and then I'll immediately start
yelling for Tooma. (yelling) Tooma!

00:34:11.877 --> 00:34:15.123
MATT: Okay, while he's doing that, what are you
guys doing?

00:34:15.123 --> 00:34:18.680
TRAVIS: Right, so the dragon's got booty, right?

00:34:18.680 --> 00:34:20.544
LAURA: Yeah, like a lot.

00:34:20.544 --> 00:34:25.766
TRAVIS: So I look over and they're working on the
dragon bits. Everything's cool? Yenk is like

00:34:25.766 --> 00:34:28.832
melting into the snow, right, because he's like a
hell fiend or whatever?

00:34:28.832 --> 00:34:29.935
MATT: Yeah.

00:34:29.935 --> 00:34:31.572
TRAVIS: I take off running towards the lair.

00:34:31.572 --> 00:34:32.420
LAURA: Grog!

00:34:32.420 --> 00:34:35.088
SAM: I'm going to go with.

00:34:35.088 --> 00:34:40.409
MATT: Grog's already run off. Scanlan's
following.

00:34:40.409 --> 00:34:42.686
SAM: I'm going to Polymorph into an eagle.

00:34:42.686 --> 00:34:45.659
LAURA: Fucking fuck! Do you guys have this?

00:34:45.659 --> 00:34:47.596
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:34:47.596 --> 00:34:52.465
LAURA: Give me a claw. I want a claw to wear around
my neck.

00:34:52.465 --> 00:34:54.073
MARISHA: You're going to be like Mr. T.

00:34:54.073 --> 00:34:59.569
LAURA: I want something to wear around my neck.
Fucking something, all right!

00:34:59.569 --> 00:35:00.902
TALIESIN: We'll find something.

00:35:00.902 --> 00:35:02.642
LAURA: I'll take off on the broom after Grog.

00:35:02.642 --> 00:35:06.679
LIAM: Just scooping up Pike into a bit of a piggy
back ride and carrying her inside and we're going

00:35:06.679 --> 00:35:07.896
to rest.

00:35:07.896 --> 00:35:15.734
MATT: Okay. She's thoroughly hurt, but you still
have the entrance to the mansion. Yeah, so you

00:35:15.734 --> 00:35:21.245
guys pull into there to rest for the moment. While
Grog, as you're running, this eagle comes up to

00:35:21.245 --> 00:35:26.796
your side, is gaining on you a bit. As you come
over the top of this one little ridge area, as the

00:35:26.796 --> 00:35:34.716
ravine begins to widen and head towards the lair
portion that Vorugal was using, you see before you

00:35:34.716 --> 00:35:41.211
a group of about 22 or so armored dragonborn that
are currently jogging up the ramp in your

00:35:41.211 --> 00:35:48.210
direction. As soon as you cross over the top they
come to a slower point, with their weapons out,

00:35:48.210 --> 00:35:54.217
and you see one of them raise its hand. You
recognize Skork, who you met earlier, who goes,

00:35:54.217 --> 00:35:57.526
"We've come to aid you!"

00:35:57.526 --> 00:36:03.773
TAVIS: I'm still raging using Persistent Rage and
I point over my shoulder and yell, Dragon that way!

00:36:03.773 --> 00:36:05.357
And I keep running past them.

00:36:05.357 --> 00:36:09.864
MATT: All right! They pick up their weapons and keep
running past you as you [whoosh] through them, the eagle

00:36:09.864 --> 00:36:11.004
following closely after.

00:36:11.004 --> 00:36:12.013
SAM: Is Tooma with them?

00:36:12.013 --> 00:36:13.201
MATT: Tooma is not with them, no.

00:36:13.201 --> 00:36:15.215
LAURA: I followed too. I am following as well.

00:36:15.215 --> 00:36:17.785
MATT: Yeah, you coast up behind, you begin
catching up to Grog and the wayward eagle. You're

00:36:17.785 --> 00:36:19.263
the fastest of everything right now.

00:36:19.263 --> 00:36:20.711
SAM: I'm following him.

00:36:20.711 --> 00:36:25.340
MATT: So you're staying back at same speed. Okay.
As you guys begin carving, you begin hearing the

00:36:25.340 --> 00:36:32.364
footsteps approaching of numerous dragonborn. The
rest of you guys continue down the path. You see

00:36:32.364 --> 00:36:39.330
the icy throne, if you will, of where Vorugal had
placed as the new lair on this northern portion of

00:36:39.330 --> 00:36:45.903
the ravine. You guys that are staying behind, as
you're carving your way into the dragon, all of a

00:36:45.903 --> 00:36:52.120
sudden you hear the footsteps and a bunch of these
dragonborn, armored, with scavenged pieces,

00:36:52.120 --> 00:36:59.294
leather hide with metallic bits of armor. Weapons,
definitely not of the highest degree from what you

00:36:59.294 --> 00:37:05.327
can tell, though some are ornate and seemingly
unused, maybe scavenged from the fall of Draconia.

00:37:05.327 --> 00:37:12.018
They approach and slow their jog and look over
at the destroyed corpse of the dragon.

00:37:12.018 --> 00:37:14.235
MARISHA: Hi.

00:37:14.235 --> 00:37:15.369
TALIESIN: Things went well.

00:37:15.369 --> 00:37:18.122
MARISHA: Man, how long of a jog is that?

00:37:18.122 --> 00:37:23.625
MATT: They all look confused at each other and
start talking to each other in a language you

00:37:23.625 --> 00:37:24.924
don't understand.

00:37:24.924 --> 00:37:29.430
MARISHA: Man, ooh, Vex isn't here.

00:37:29.430 --> 00:37:36.752
TALIESIN: No. All good. Good.

00:37:36.752 --> 00:37:38.035
TRAVIS: Fuck.

00:37:38.035 --> 00:37:46.025
MATT: They nod and Skork gives a respectful nod
and they all approach the dragon's corpse and

00:37:46.025 --> 00:37:47.049
start hacking into it.

00:37:47.049 --> 00:37:50.166
MARISHA: Oh no, wait, no. Hold on.

00:37:50.166 --> 00:38:09.275
TALIESIN: No. I'm going to point at all-- you all,
sun goes down, all of us drink back there.

00:38:09.275 --> 00:38:11.081
Go back. Everything's fine.

00:38:11.081 --> 00:38:15.786
MATT: Skork takes two steps forward and goes, "I
understand this speak."

00:38:15.786 --> 00:38:21.942
TALIESIN: Oh, why didn't you say something? You're
standing there making us very nervous.

00:38:21.942 --> 00:38:31.938
MATT: (disgruntled grunt) "Look. We have to come
to aid you in the battle as promised. You have

00:38:31.938 --> 00:38:38.943
"seemingly done well without our presence. So let's
all harvest the uses of what remains of this beast."

00:38:38.943 --> 00:38:46.350
TALIESIN: I'm fair with that, all right. Harvest
gently. We're trying to keep as much of it--

00:38:46.350 --> 00:38:50.711
MARISHA: Yes, I'm working right here on this area
and Vex wants a claw.

00:38:50.711 --> 00:38:58.685
MATT: "Take what you wish. We are interested
in hide and meat."

00:38:58.685 --> 00:39:04.169
TALIESIN: And we are interested in scale, tooth,
and claw, and maybe some eyeballs, so that works

00:39:04.169 --> 00:39:05.294
out very well.

00:39:05.294 --> 00:39:06.175
MARISHA: And blood.

00:39:06.175 --> 00:39:11.890
MATT: "Perhaps some teeth and claws as well. We
shall trade." (speaks Draconic) All of them rush

00:39:11.890 --> 00:39:18.114
up and start hacking into the soft portions of the
underbelly, where it's been exposed from where you

00:39:18.114 --> 00:39:22.524
guys have left large wounds and such and basically
start to carve huge bits of dragon meat off the body.

00:39:22.524 --> 00:39:24.375
TALIESIN: Mind the tree. Mind the tree.

00:39:24.375 --> 00:39:31.733
MATT: One of them was going for the tree and stops
like-- And then looks very confused that the tree

00:39:31.733 --> 00:39:36.288
wasn't piercing through the dragon, but was rooted
inside of it. They all take a moment to start

00:39:36.288 --> 00:39:41.524
carving around it. It's a very awkward. They don't
know what the hell happened and it looks very

00:39:41.524 --> 00:39:44.407
strange from an outsider's perspective, but
they're trying to adjust best they can.

00:39:44.407 --> 00:39:46.697
TRAVIS: New town square will be built around it.

00:39:46.697 --> 00:39:54.834
MATT: In the meantime, the three of you guys coast
down towards the lair. You can still see all the

00:39:54.834 --> 00:40:03.257
ice spires that are jutting out from portions of
the snow, the various dragonborn corpses still

00:40:03.257 --> 00:40:10.273
adorning a number of the spires. As you begin to
approach the throne of Vorugal, you can see

00:40:10.273 --> 00:40:15.804
there's a group of about 15 or so dragonborn
currently there that are starting to climb up and

00:40:15.804 --> 00:40:23.243
get to that portion to inspect. You see, first,
before anyone else does, Vex, that one of them

00:40:23.243 --> 00:40:29.779
appears to be Tooma, who is walking with this
gnarled staff that she keeps to her side. And

00:40:29.779 --> 00:40:32.948
they're all approaching and climbing up the sides
of the throne to get to the top.

00:40:32.948 --> 00:40:36.104
LAURA: I shout out, don't go up there!

00:40:36.104 --> 00:40:39.668
MATT: You shout that and there's a moment of
pause. Then, all of them turn and look in your

00:40:39.668 --> 00:40:41.091
direction.

00:40:41.091 --> 00:40:49.799
LAURA: I fly down close to Tooma and say quietly,
Thordak has means of seeing through the stones up

00:40:49.799 --> 00:40:56.756
there. If you go up top, it's possible he'll be
able to know that Vorugal has fallen. He might

00:40:56.756 --> 00:40:57.968
already know.

00:40:57.968 --> 00:41:06.038
MATT: "This is good to know." (speaks Draconic)
And the dragonborn around slowly pull backwards.

00:41:06.038 --> 00:41:12.622
You understand her saying, "Hold off. Words of
warning." They all pull back and gather around

00:41:12.622 --> 00:41:21.227
you, and stand, awaiting what this conversation is
going to entail as Tooma steps forward to you. "So

00:41:21.227 --> 00:41:25.512
"am I to understand, then, that the dragon has
fallen?"

00:41:25.512 --> 00:41:27.085
LAURA: (laughing) Yes.

00:41:27.085 --> 00:41:32.516
SAM: I'll drop my form and throw the scale in
front of her. It's done. There's your fucking

00:41:32.516 --> 00:41:33.849
dragon.

00:41:33.849 --> 00:41:44.985
MATT: She looks over at the rest of the people who
are all looking towards her for confirmation. She

00:41:44.985 --> 00:41:57.179
goes, "You came to us with words. You stood behind
them. You displayed honor and honesty, things we

00:41:57.179 --> 00:42:10.546
"find rare in supply outside of our people. Us, the
Ravenites, survivors of chain and frost, are now

00:42:10.546 --> 00:42:14.830
"truly free. We thank you."

00:42:14.830 --> 00:42:17.283
LAURA: And we thank you.

00:42:17.283 --> 00:42:25.454
SAM: But we'll need something more than just
thanks. We have two requests to make of you. One,

00:42:25.454 --> 00:42:31.231
this is not the final fight. There will be more,
and unlike this fight, we would expect your aid in

00:42:31.231 --> 00:42:34.391
the next one. Is that something you can guarantee
us?

00:42:34.391 --> 00:42:43.132
MATT: "I am curious as to what you require from
us."

00:42:43.132 --> 00:42:50.102
SAM: We don't know yet, but you have many men, and
they seem like good fighters, so we may call upon

00:42:50.102 --> 00:42:52.146
you in the future.

00:42:52.146 --> 00:42:53.701
MATT: "Against what foe?"

00:42:53.701 --> 00:42:59.305
LAURA: Thordak the Ancient. He was commander of
all of these dragons.

00:42:59.305 --> 00:43:11.872
MATT: You see her face immediately goes from that
calm, welcoming, elated expression she had a

00:43:11.872 --> 00:43:17.652
moment ago to this guarded, retracted position
where she shifts her weight onto the back leg and--

00:43:17.652 --> 00:43:28.322
LAURA: You are not beholden to us. We ask this of
your own free will. All of Tal'Dorei is at risk.

00:43:28.322 --> 00:43:43.564
MATT: "We are not an army. We wish to help in &lt;i&gt;this&lt;/i&gt;
fight, for we had a stake in it, both of us. This

00:43:43.564 --> 00:43:52.848
"was a mutual arrangement. You owe us nothing. We
owe you nothing. But we are not ready to continue

00:43:52.848 --> 00:43:57.048
"the fight immediately with a more dangerous foe
than this one."

00:43:57.048 --> 00:44:03.642
SAM: Hopefully, it won't be immediately. And might
I remind you that you did &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; help us in this

00:44:03.642 --> 00:44:05.423
fight. We did it all by ourselves.

00:44:05.423 --> 00:44:12.024
MATT: "Who do you think arranged, through previous
conversation, to send the dragon your way into the

00:44:12.024 --> 00:44:20.521
"trap that you had sprung? At my suggestion of the
place of proper, and most conventional and helpful

00:44:20.521 --> 00:44:21.815
"circumstances?"

00:44:21.815 --> 00:44:24.074
LAURA: It's true, Scanlan, they did help a lot in
that regard.

00:44:24.074 --> 00:44:27.461
MATT: "We may not have the might to finish the
dragon--"

00:44:27.461 --> 00:44:31.703
SAM: You told us that you would have men there to
help us, and there was nothing. We almost died.

00:44:31.703 --> 00:44:33.163
MATT: "We sent men your way!"

00:44:33.163 --> 00:44:34.555
SAM: You knew when the fight was.

00:44:34.555 --> 00:44:40.365
MATT: "We knew when to begin the fight, but we do
not have means of travelling as fast as a dragon!"

00:44:40.365 --> 00:44:46.590
TRAVIS: I'm running around like a cracked-out PCP
addict in the background. Just looking on the

00:44:46.590 --> 00:44:48.576
ground for booty, that's all.

00:44:48.576 --> 00:44:52.081
MATT: Perception check.

00:44:52.081 --> 00:44:53.216
TRAVIS: One.

00:44:53.216 --> 00:44:54.935
(laughter)

00:44:54.935 --> 00:44:57.805
MATT: There is snow and ice and it's pissing you
off!

00:44:57.805 --> 00:45:00.639
TRAVIS: I'm doing the dog thing.

00:45:00.639 --> 00:45:05.586
MATT: More snow. More and more snow. In the middle
of this conversation, some of it starts spattering

00:45:05.586 --> 00:45:13.560
the side of Vex. You're like, "Stop it!" Angrily
rage-looting nothing. (laughs)

00:45:13.560 --> 00:45:21.203
LAURA: Draconia has had a history of separating
itself from the rest of Tal'Dorei. This is an

00:45:21.203 --> 00:45:30.146
opportunity for &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; to welcome other
communities, to become part of the rest of the world.

00:45:30.146 --> 00:45:46.061
MATT: "You are right. [no audio] And from this, I think we
could try to rebuild, a new home for the

00:45:46.061 --> 00:45:58.016
"dragonborn of Wildemount. Learn from the mistakes
of our predecessors and our oppressors. We are no

00:45:58.056 --> 00:46:05.082
"majestic mage nation by any means, but we can
learn."

00:46:05.124 --> 00:46:08.896
LAURA: You are strong.

00:46:08.937 --> 00:46:19.636
MAT: "&lt;i&gt;They&lt;/i&gt; are strong. My time is nearly up. But
what time I have left, I fully intend to make sure

00:46:19.636 --> 00:46:24.449
"that there is a future for my people. For the
Ravenites."

00:46:24.449 --> 00:46:34.921
SAM: One more request, before we go. Once we're
long gone, you can feel free to inspect this hill

00:46:34.921 --> 00:46:42.093
where the dragon slept, and be very careful in
disarming any traps that you might find there. I

00:46:42.093 --> 00:46:51.260
would ask you one favor for us: we lost a friend
in this fight, a dragonborn. He's buried near

00:46:51.260 --> 00:46:58.744
here. We'll tell you where. We would like a proper
tomb for him on this hill, where the dragon slept.

00:46:58.744 --> 00:47:05.638
Could you build a statue, a fine statue, a
handsome statue of Tiberius Stormwind, and bury

00:47:05.638 --> 00:47:12.063
him underneath it. And on the pedestal, could you
please write, "I encourage peace."

00:47:12.063 --> 00:47:23.563
MATT: She looks over at one of the nearby
dragonborn. "This is Korsa. He is our finest

00:47:23.563 --> 00:47:27.948
"stonesmith. I will see to it that it is done."

00:47:27.948 --> 00:47:34.209
SAM: Teach your people of him, your offspring,
that he was a brave dragonborn that wanted to

00:47:34.209 --> 00:47:36.284
unify all of your peoples.

00:47:36.284 --> 00:47:48.394
MATT: "This can be done. (sighs) This mound
represents the spoils of the remains of Draconia

00:47:48.394 --> 00:48:02.121
"the dragon greedily stole, hoarded, and forced us
to gather at the base of its icy seat. This will

00:48:02.121 --> 00:48:13.160
"be the beginning of our new nation, and with this,
we will make sure this statue comes to bear."

00:48:13.160 --> 00:48:17.001
SAM: Good luck.

00:48:17.001 --> 00:48:21.213
TRAVIS: Where the fuck is it?! That's all you hear
me say.

00:48:21.213 --> 00:48:23.065
(laughter)

00:48:23.065 --> 00:48:25.508
SAM: What are you looking for?

00:48:25.508 --> 00:48:26.984
TRAVIS: Help me look!

00:48:26.984 --> 00:48:28.159
SAM: For what? What are we looking for?

00:48:28.159 --> 00:48:29.407
TRAVIS: Just dig!

00:48:29.407 --> 00:48:31.412
(laughter)

00:48:31.412 --> 00:48:33.567
TRAVIS: Can I make another perception check,
please?

00:48:33.567 --> 00:48:34.611
MATT: No.

00:48:34.611 --> 00:48:35.646
TRAVIS: No?!

00:48:35.646 --> 00:48:36.992
MATT: You can, Scanlan.

00:48:36.992 --> 00:48:40.520
SAM: What am I looking for? Grog, what am I
looking for?

00:48:40.520 --> 00:48:43.286
TRAVIS: We're looking for that booty.

00:48:43.286 --> 00:48:47.797
SAM: Booty? Just dragon booty? It would be up
where the dragon sleeps, not down here.

00:48:47.797 --> 00:48:50.360
LAURA: There's some under the ice right here.

00:48:50.360 --> 00:48:56.955
SAM: All right, I will peer down into the ice
below us with my 21 perception.

00:48:56.955 --> 00:49:05.198
MATT: Okay. You glance down, and after pushing
some of the snow out of the way, it's amazing that

00:49:05.198 --> 00:49:14.474
Grog didn't see this at all, but not really when
you think about it. Encased in this pedestal that

00:49:14.474 --> 00:49:24.534
Vorugal had taken as a perch, beneath multiple
feet of thick, locked ice, you see an incredible

00:49:24.534 --> 00:49:31.616
amount of hoarded gold, silver, platinum
glittering as bits of light break through the

00:49:31.616 --> 00:49:37.992
overhead clouds, as the sleet is still raining
down in places. Bits of it gleam and shift and

00:49:37.992 --> 00:49:45.138
shimmer. You can see finely crafted knick-knacks
and statues and gems and antiqued metals all

00:49:45.138 --> 00:49:52.521
buried deep beneath this platform. It looks to be
pieces of ornate armor and weaponry, all sorts of

00:49:52.521 --> 00:49:57.497
a random assortment of items that are locked
beneath feet of ice, right there before you.

00:49:57.497 --> 00:50:00.364
SAM: Nothing there, Grog. Sorry.

00:50:00.364 --> 00:50:02.451
TRAVIS: No! It has to be here somewhere!

00:50:02.451 --> 00:50:06.286
SAM: (whispering) Just look right there, friend.

00:50:06.286 --> 00:50:07.125
TRAVIS: What?

00:50:07.125 --> 00:50:08.018
SAM: (whispering) Right there.

00:50:08.018 --> 00:50:10.235
TRAVIS: Where? What?

00:50:10.235 --> 00:50:11.661
SAM: He's my BFF.

00:50:11.661 --> 00:50:12.712
TRAVIS: I see it?

00:50:12.712 --> 00:50:18.017
MATT: Oh yeah, once he points it out, you
immediately clarify and the red haze that was

00:50:18.017 --> 00:50:20.181
covering your eyes suddenly fades and you see
shiny.

00:50:20.181 --> 00:50:25.394
TRAVIS: Can I use the siege portion of the
Titanstone Knuckles and start smacking the shit

00:50:25.394 --> 00:50:27.052
out of this ice trying to get down there?

00:50:27.052 --> 00:50:28.061
MATT: Yes, you can.

00:50:28.061 --> 00:50:29.345
TRAVIS: Just like (smashing noises).

00:50:29.345 --> 00:50:32.552
MATT: Yeah. (laughs)

00:50:32.552 --> 00:50:38.602
TRAVIS: I deal double damage against objects or
structures.

00:50:38.602 --> 00:50:45.831
MATT: Yeah, and as you start, each punch, the ice
(splintering noise) more cracks begin to spider

00:50:45.831 --> 00:50:50.346
out. An incredible feat of strength and you can
see the dragonborn take a few steps back at this

00:50:50.346 --> 00:50:55.546
view, and Tooma is almost intrigued at this point,
staring with this grin across her face as this

00:50:55.546 --> 00:51:04.317
symbolic destruction of what represented Vorugal's
lording over their entire life is being ripped

00:51:04.317 --> 00:51:13.115
apart by this half-giant madman. A few more
punches through and a whole portion slides off and

00:51:13.115 --> 00:51:17.337
you have to move out of the way. You knock it
aside with your fist and keep punching through and

00:51:17.337 --> 00:51:22.825
eventually you get about, over the next ten or 15
minutes, breaking through enough of the ice that

00:51:22.825 --> 00:51:29.635
you start hitting (clanging), starting to hit the
actual outskirts of this large pile of gold pieces.

00:51:29.635 --> 00:51:35.279
LAURA: Wait, Grog. Can I check for any traps or is
it like totally fine? Because I've been here

00:51:35.279 --> 00:51:37.288
before and it's not pleasant.

00:51:37.288 --> 00:51:39.635
TRAVIS: I really wouldn't mind.

00:51:39.635 --> 00:51:45.151
LAURA: Investigation? 18?

00:51:45.151 --> 00:51:51.799
MATT: Okay, glancing about best you can in the
vicinity, you don't see any traps.

00:51:51.799 --> 00:51:58.221
LAURA: What about the gemstones? Those are up
high. I'm staying away from those.

00:51:58.221 --> 00:52:03.349
SAM: We're outside the perimeter of the gemstones
or the the main portion of the lair, right?

00:52:03.349 --> 00:52:13.476
MATT: Yeah, the orbs are embedded in the top
restful area. The actual hoard is hidden, locked

00:52:13.476 --> 00:52:17.871
beneath the ice at the base of this large
platform, so you're essentially punching through

00:52:17.871 --> 00:52:24.979
the bottom portion. Much like any sandcastle, the
further you go, the less structural integrity it

00:52:24.979 --> 00:52:33.454
has. You're starting to make headway into
releasing and finding access to some of the horde

00:52:33.454 --> 00:52:34.602
yourself.

00:52:34.602 --> 00:52:39.967
TRAVIS: We need heat, and more than my wee urine
can generate.

00:52:39.967 --> 00:52:42.489
SAM: I can give us a little bit of fire?

00:52:42.489 --> 00:52:47.047
TRAVIS: Yeah, I mean, or get Keyleth over here.

00:52:47.047 --> 00:52:51.314
LAURA: Do you have dragon's breath?

00:52:51.314 --> 00:52:57.871
MATT: She points to two of them and brings them
over and two of the dragonborn step forward and

00:52:57.871 --> 00:53:04.044
release this torrent of flame into the area that
you've already carved out.

00:53:04.044 --> 00:53:05.381
SAM: Ooh, they can do that?

00:53:05.381 --> 00:53:09.766
MATT: Yeah, it only lasts a few seconds and it
causes a portion of it to melt back, but it's

00:53:09.766 --> 00:53:15.101
still extremely strong ice and it didn't have as
much of an impact as you hoped it would've. This

00:53:15.101 --> 00:53:21.745
is very, very sturdy white dragon-conjured,
ice-protected walls.

00:53:21.745 --> 00:53:24.815
LAURA: Just keep on punching it, Grog.

00:53:24.815 --> 00:53:25.762
TRAVIS: Really?

00:53:25.762 --> 00:53:27.573
LAURA: Just punch it. You're doing some good
damage.

00:53:27.573 --> 00:53:28.712
TRAVIS: But no fireballs?

00:53:28.712 --> 00:53:32.009
SAM: I have a fireball. I'll send a fireball over
there. Back up a little bit.

00:53:32.009 --> 00:53:34.023
TRAVIS: Why? What if I want to be close?

00:53:34.023 --> 00:53:35.614
SAM: Well, you'll get burned.

00:53:35.614 --> 00:53:38.064
LIAM: You're way down by 101 hit points, though.

00:53:38.064 --> 00:53:40.881
TRAVIS: I know. Yeah, I'm still up in the three
digits. Let's make it exciting.

00:53:40.881 --> 00:53:42.888
SAM: I'm not going to burn you, Grog. Just take
ten feet.

00:53:42.888 --> 00:53:44.481
TRAVIS: All right, all right! Ten feet!

00:53:44.481 --> 00:53:51.632
SAM: All right, I'll send a wand of fireballs
down. I don't know, is that magic actually hot

00:53:51.632 --> 00:53:52.859
when it goes off?

00:53:52.859 --> 00:54:01.222
MATT: Yeah, it's hot and it's an explosion. It's
not just fire. It's an explosion. So it detonates

00:54:01.222 --> 00:54:11.314
from the inside of that small concave path that you
had punched through and as it hits and detonates

00:54:11.314 --> 00:54:24.476
you can see the ice further crack. The ice begins
to crack even further and portions of it, you see

00:54:24.476 --> 00:54:30.310
a bit of snow bank that had gathered at the top
shakes free and off the side, revealing some of

00:54:30.310 --> 00:54:31.420
the upper platform.

00:54:31.420 --> 00:54:33.971
SAM: We don't want to make too much of a
disturbance here.

00:54:33.971 --> 00:54:35.222
LAURA: No, we don't.

00:54:35.222 --> 00:54:36.874
SAM: Let's just take some stuff on the outside.

00:54:36.874 --> 00:54:41.412
TRAVIS: Is there any free platinum or gold or
little bits I can start to put in my hands?

00:54:41.412 --> 00:54:46.328
MATT: Yeah, you can start scooping bits.

00:54:46.328 --> 00:54:51.149
LAURA: You might want to ask Tooma if she has a
problem with you taking all of Draconia's gold.

00:54:51.149 --> 00:55:03.160
TRAVIS: You saw what his face did, didn't you?
Tooma, we are about to unsheathe and reveal a

00:55:03.160 --> 00:55:08.251
great fortune, of which we have very little
interest because honestly it weighs us down.

00:55:08.251 --> 00:55:14.170
We're, like, plenty loaded already. However, it is
a tradition to take little bits here and there as

00:55:14.170 --> 00:55:15.439
keepsakes.

00:55:15.439 --> 00:55:27.447
MATT: "The spoils here were largely collected from
the wreckage of our captors and much of the gold

00:55:27.447 --> 00:55:35.366
"here was earned through our blood and turmoil.
However, we were able to free ourselves and have

00:55:35.366 --> 00:55:43.989
"access to this fortune a great deal thanks to your
aid. We are more than willing to divide this

00:55:43.989 --> 00:55:46.309
"between your folk and ours."

00:55:46.309 --> 00:55:56.274
TRAVIS: That sounds most generous. Shall we look
for specifically interesting little bits, or just

00:55:56.274 --> 00:55:57.779
grab the platinum?

00:55:57.779 --> 00:55:59.517
SAM: Just grab whatever's closest and leave.

00:55:59.517 --> 00:56:06.519
TRAVIS: Are there any interesting-looking weapons
or unique items that are out of the ordinary?

00:56:06.519 --> 00:56:08.485
MATT: Make an investigation check.

00:56:08.485 --> 00:56:10.956
LAURA: Any looking-magically thingies?

00:56:10.956 --> 00:56:12.518
MATT: Make an investigation check.

00:56:12.518 --> 00:56:15.830
TRAVIS: Yes! Minus two. 17.

00:56:15.830 --> 00:56:27.531
SAM: I will look for weapons of any sort. Ooh, 30.
Investigation, right?

00:56:27.531 --> 00:56:28.674
MATT: Yeah.

00:56:28.674 --> 00:56:30.182
LAURA: 16.

00:56:30.182 --> 00:56:35.160
MATT: (laughing) Do you want to add your bardic
inspiration dice to that to be a dick?

00:56:35.160 --> 00:56:36.902
LAURA: Inspire me!

00:56:36.902 --> 00:56:38.289
SAM: Did you suck or something?

00:56:38.289 --> 00:56:39.681
LAURA: Yeah, I only got 16.

00:56:39.681 --> 00:56:48.596
SAM: Okay, I will add my bardic inspiration. I
will sing to her. (singing) Something in the way I

00:56:48.596 --> 00:57:00.487
wink, inspires you like no other gnome can.
Something makes you stop and think, how did he get

00:57:00.487 --> 00:57:04.961
so handsome? How did he get so suave?

00:57:04.961 --> 00:57:08.496
LAURA: Six extra points, so 22.

00:57:08.496 --> 00:57:11.497
MATT: All right, there you go.

00:57:11.497 --> 00:57:29.680
Now Critical Role owes a royalty to the
Beatles. All right, so, Grog, you find a painted

00:57:29.680 --> 00:57:35.068
gold war mask that looks really cool and nasty
with the lower jaw. You're like, yes and you can

00:57:35.068 --> 00:57:36.102
put it on.

00:57:36.102 --> 00:57:39.255
TRAVIS: Yep, in fact, I lick it knowing that it's
cold and I stick it to my face.

00:57:39.255 --> 00:57:41.611
MATT: Okay. Your tongue sticks to the mask.

00:57:41.611 --> 00:57:42.989
TRAVIS: Fuck! And I rip it off.

00:57:42.989 --> 00:57:52.324
MATT: You rip it off, all right. You take a point
of damage. And your tongue is pounding with pain

00:57:52.324 --> 00:58:02.027
(throbbing) as the top layer of skin has been torn
off your tongue. But the mask is still yours. You

00:58:02.027 --> 00:58:09.917
do also find a really beautiful black stone. It's
really well cut and it's about that big and it's

00:58:09.917 --> 00:58:12.749
really pretty and dark and awesome.

00:58:12.749 --> 00:58:15.259
TRAVIS: I love stones. I'm a fucking fan.

00:58:15.259 --> 00:58:30.097
MATT: And a whole shitton of gold and platinum.
You, looking through, you find a beautiful reddish

00:58:30.097 --> 00:58:36.243
ruby gem that has this slightly gold refraction in
the center of it that's somewhat symmetrical, it

00:58:36.243 --> 00:58:46.122
looks otherworldly almost. It's beautiful. You see
deeper within the actual hoard a ship's mast that

00:58:46.122 --> 00:58:52.458
was plated with gold that has been jammed in the
center of the hoard, wreckage that was dragged

00:58:52.458 --> 00:59:03.333
here and included in the hoard. You do also see,
amongst some of the gold, a small vial with liquid

00:59:03.333 --> 00:59:06.186
that is unaffected by the freezing temperatures
around it.

00:59:06.186 --> 00:59:08.962
LAURA: What color is the liquid?

00:59:08.962 --> 00:59:13.081
MATT: The liquid is-- let me look that up.

00:59:13.081 --> 00:59:16.632
TRAVIS: This is my favourite part, getting new
shit.

00:59:16.632 --> 00:59:26.014
MATT: It is like a thick syrupy metallic, like a
liquid iron, a reddish metallic tint to it.

00:59:26.014 --> 00:59:30.416
TRAVIS: I had an idea until reddish, but I don't
know anymore.

00:59:30.416 --> 00:59:41.263
MATT: And you find a pair of boots that are made
from a very thick, dark brown hide.

00:59:41.263 --> 00:59:44.060
LAURA: Another boots of haste! For sure!

00:59:44.060 --> 00:59:46.355
TRAVIS: They're probably like elephant strength
boots.

00:59:46.355 --> 00:59:50.615
LAURA: Definitely boots of haste! Pair of boots
out of brown leather, you said?

00:59:50.615 --> 00:59:56.608
MATT: Yeah, a dark brown leather, not very
elaborate in their design, but they're well made

00:59:56.608 --> 00:59:59.823
and seemingly have braved the cold weather well
enough.

00:59:59.823 --> 01:00:02.143
TALIESIN: They're Boots of Taste that you have.

01:00:02.143 --> 01:00:03.777
TRAVIS: I appreciate well-made boots.

01:00:03.777 --> 01:00:05.307
LIAM and TALIESIN: They're Uggs.

01:00:05.307 --> 01:00:07.944
TRAVIS: Do we have an approximation of the gold and
platinum?

01:00:07.944 --> 01:00:11.456
MATT: We'll get to that in a second. Sam!

01:00:11.456 --> 01:00:14.410
SAM: I'm sorry, who?

01:00:14.410 --> 01:00:15.716
MATT: Scanlan.

01:00:15.716 --> 01:00:16.670
SAM: Thank you.

01:00:16.670 --> 01:00:18.472
LIAM: Whoa! What just happened?

01:00:18.472 --> 01:00:33.740
MATT: You find amongst this a platinum bracelet
set with a gorgeous sapphire that looks like it's

01:00:33.792 --> 01:00:43.010
probably worth quite a bit. You also find another
unbroken vial amongst a series of other vials that

01:00:43.010 --> 01:00:47.000
did break in the process of being hoarded here,
the liquid spilled out. There's one unbroken vial.

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:58.430
This one is a yellowish fluid with black swirls
that shift on their own inside the vial's

01:00:58.430 --> 01:01:05.668
contents. As you shake it, you see they move at a
faster speed and then slow down in a reverse

01:01:05.668 --> 01:01:07.799
direction. It's a very interesting pattern.

01:01:07.799 --> 01:01:09.519
TALIESIN: Lava lamp.

01:01:09.519 --> 01:01:16.162
MATT: Kind of. Underneath that vial, you see a
very beautiful--

01:01:16.162 --> 01:01:21.544
LAURA: Ooh, sheets of paper!

01:01:21.544 --> 01:01:26.254
TRAVIS: I love this shit. It's like walking into a
Toys 'R' Us. It's the fucking best. It's like,

01:01:26.254 --> 01:01:27.591
"Which way do I go?!"

01:01:27.591 --> 01:01:29.301
LIAM: Find the Plate of the Dawnmartyr.

01:01:29.301 --> 01:01:32.672
SAM: That was easy!

01:01:32.672 --> 01:01:41.725
MATT: There you go! You find a gold and platinum
band that is two separate bands that are woven

01:01:41.725 --> 01:01:43.878
together like a braid in a band.

01:01:43.878 --> 01:01:45.782
SAM: Like a back braid?

01:01:45.782 --> 01:01:54.556
MATT: Kind of. Other than that, it looks nice.
There's no other defining markings on it. Looks

01:01:54.556 --> 01:02:01.116
like it would be worth quite a bit. You do, also,
as you rolled ridiculously high, in pulling the

01:02:01.116 --> 01:02:07.231
ring out and the vial, you glance over and a
handle is embedded in a large part of the gold.

01:02:07.231 --> 01:02:14.092
You go and grab it and it's actually a pretty big
handle once you get your gnomish hand on it. You

01:02:14.092 --> 01:02:27.199
pull and you pull forth a very beautiful platinum
greatsword. It has a series of small symbols

01:02:27.199 --> 01:02:36.003
carved along the base of the blade on each side.
The handle comes a gradual upward curve. It looks

01:02:36.003 --> 01:02:42.701
beautiful, ornamental, like something you'd see in
a temple as part of a centerpiece. But it's

01:02:42.701 --> 01:02:48.488
weighted properly for a greatsword and is far too
big for you to ever possibly muster in battle.

01:02:48.488 --> 01:02:51.491
SAM: I can't use this, so I'll just leave it.

01:02:51.491 --> 01:02:56.317
TRAVIS: Wait! Let's not be hasty! My god, it's
beautiful!

01:02:56.317 --> 01:02:57.895
SAM: Do you want it?

01:02:57.895 --> 01:03:01.502
TRAVIS: I'm very emotional about this right now.
Can I check it for traps?

01:03:01.502 --> 01:03:02.934
SAM: Check it for traps.

01:03:02.934 --> 01:03:04.501
MATT: Make an investigation check.

01:03:04.501 --> 01:03:06.403
TRAVIS: Natural 20!

01:03:06.403 --> 01:03:10.242
LAURA: It is a natural 20, oh my god.

01:03:10.242 --> 01:03:16.341
MATT: You have never been so sure in your life
that this sword: totally not trapped.

01:03:16.341 --> 01:03:21.387
TALIESIN: I'm so hoping it talks to you now, I'm
so hoping it starts talking to you.

01:03:21.387 --> 01:03:22.574
TRAVIS: 'Tis clean.

01:03:22.574 --> 01:03:23.433
SAM: 'Tis clean?

01:03:23.433 --> 01:03:24.356
TRAVIS: Yes.

01:03:24.356 --> 01:03:27.653
SAM: You hold it, I can't hold it, it's too heavy.
It weighs as much as I do.

01:03:27.653 --> 01:03:33.776
LAURA: How's it feel, Grog?

01:03:33.776 --> 01:03:37.206
TRAVIS: Feels like money, money, money.

01:03:37.206 --> 01:03:40.928
LAURA: Speaking of money, money, money.

01:03:40.928 --> 01:03:48.062
MATT: As you begin pulling out these materials, a
series of the other Ravenites start gathering

01:03:48.062 --> 01:03:53.213
gold, filling sacks and having to pass them off.
You see now two of them are pulling two big carts

01:03:53.213 --> 01:04:00.422
over and are loading up cash in the area. This is
going to push your bag of holding.

01:04:00.422 --> 01:04:02.790
TRAVIS: That's why I said we can't take that
much.

01:04:02.790 --> 01:04:05.505
LAURA: But if it's platinum, it'll help.

01:04:05.505 --> 01:04:08.799
MARISHA: More bang for our buck.

01:04:08.799 --> 01:04:11.062
SAM: What can we lose from the bag of holding?

01:04:11.062 --> 01:04:13.625
TRAVIS: I'm very emotional about some of this.

01:04:13.625 --> 01:04:20.815
MATT: You get about 20 minutes of gathering gold
and platinum pieces from the section you have

01:04:20.815 --> 01:04:27.218
access to. You could get more, if you continue to
dig beneath, probably. You manage to pull roughly,

01:04:27.218 --> 01:04:34.872
between the three of you, 18,000 gold pieces and
about 12,000 platinum pieces.

01:04:34.872 --> 01:04:39.314
(yelling)

01:04:39.314 --> 01:04:41.899
TRAVIS: Forget the dragons, let's go buy real
estate.

01:04:41.899 --> 01:04:45.973
MATT: That's a third of what's in the hoard right
now.

01:04:45.973 --> 01:04:47.973
LIAM: Park Place, motherfucker!

01:04:47.973 --> 01:04:49.723
TRAVIS: Build a fucking water park, let's go!

01:04:49.723 --> 01:04:53.867
LAURA: We don't need any more than-- This is
really nice.

01:04:53.867 --> 01:04:56.037
TALIESIN: Let's build a condominium.

01:04:56.037 --> 01:04:57.605
LIAM: Condos in Marquet.

01:04:57.605 --> 01:05:00.690
MARISHA: Parking garage, that's where it's at.

01:05:00.690 --> 01:05:02.334
LAURA: How many gold is a platinum?

01:05:02.334 --> 01:05:04.939
MATT: For the gold to platinum transition here--

01:05:04.939 --> 01:05:12.412
TRAVIS: It's a lot. Scrooge McDuck over here is
fucking swimming in that shit.

01:05:12.412 --> 01:05:14.513
SAM: With Brexit, it's not worth as much any
more.

01:05:14.513 --> 01:05:16.364
MATT: Ten gold pieces per platinum.

01:05:16.364 --> 01:05:17.216
LAURA: How many?

01:05:17.216 --> 01:05:24.585
SAM: &lt;i&gt;Ten&lt;/i&gt; gold pieces per platinum. So that's
another 120 grand. Grog. Vex. We don't need to

01:05:24.585 --> 01:05:25.864
tell the others about this

01:05:25.864 --> 01:05:27.225
LAURA: They don't need to know. No!

01:05:27.225 --> 01:05:30.926
SAM: We could go to a warm place, the three of us,
and live out the rest of our days.

01:05:30.926 --> 01:05:33.259
TRAVIS: We'll build a bank. It'll just be us.

01:05:33.259 --> 01:05:35.452
SAM: They'll never find us. We have the Dust of
Tracelessness.

01:05:35.452 --> 01:05:36.705
LAURA: I'm tempted. This is amazing.

01:05:36.705 --> 01:05:38.267
TRAVIS: Right. We kill Vex after the first month.

01:05:38.267 --> 01:05:39.445
LAURA: Wait, I can hear you.

01:05:39.445 --> 01:05:40.484
TRAVIS: I was joking.

01:05:40.484 --> 01:05:42.305
SAM: We might need her to restart civilization.

01:05:42.305 --> 01:05:43.402
TRAVIS: True, true.

01:05:43.402 --> 01:05:49.395
LAURA: Oh, you know what? Let's go back. You lost
me. I'm out.

01:05:49.395 --> 01:05:51.772
(laughter)

01:05:51.772 --> 01:06:01.267
LIAM: Meanwhile, for the last twenty minutes, I've
been combing blood out of Pike's hair, and we've

01:06:01.267 --> 01:06:09.449
been having god talk, and as I put little fun buns
in Pike's hair I say, "You know, sometimes I feel

01:06:09.449 --> 01:06:15.191
"like she is right there with me. I ask questions
and I know the answers, but most of the time I

01:06:15.191 --> 01:06:19.540
"don't know anything. Does the balance ever
shift?"

01:06:19.540 --> 01:06:26.639
MATT: "No, not really. It's part of what's great
about it, is you put your trust into them and

01:06:26.639 --> 01:06:30.242
"everything turns out okay."

01:06:30.242 --> 01:06:32.748
LIAM: That is so cool.

01:06:32.748 --> 01:06:35.696
MATT: "You saw her, she punched a dragon for me!"

01:06:35.696 --> 01:06:42.397
LIAM: We've got to find Larkin though, what do we
do about Larkin?

01:06:42.397 --> 01:06:44.300
LAURA: Okay, all right.

01:06:44.300 --> 01:06:45.590
LIAM: You're not here!

01:06:45.590 --> 01:06:52.959
MATT: "I didn't like Larkin very much. It's
probably for the best."

01:06:52.959 --> 01:06:58.492
LIAM: Aye, but he's out here on his own in the
cold. Ravenites everywhere!

01:06:58.492 --> 01:07:01.689
MATT: "Dwarves are made of hardy stuff, I'm sure
he'll be okay."

01:07:01.689 --> 01:07:04.709
LIAM: You're probably right. Let me even you off.

01:07:04.709 --> 01:07:08.769
MATT: (pained) "Thank you."

01:07:08.769 --> 01:07:10.618
MARISHA: What did we find?

01:07:10.618 --> 01:07:13.229
(laughter)

01:07:13.229 --> 01:07:15.334
SAM: Ten dragon scales, the end.

01:07:15.334 --> 01:07:26.253
MATT: All right, come back to you guys. So Vorugal
is butchered in the center of the snow here.

01:07:26.253 --> 01:07:33.175
Strangely, as you begin to carve, the air, as
freezing as it is, actual touch on the skin of

01:07:33.175 --> 01:07:37.332
Vorugal is colder, and there's a few moments where
your fingers begin to adhere to the cold and you

01:07:37.332 --> 01:07:44.888
have to pull back a bit. But you do manage to
carve from the hide, if you can carry it properly,

01:07:44.888 --> 01:07:48.647
about 150 pounds of dragon hide.

01:07:48.647 --> 01:07:52.824
MARISHA: Oh jeez. Oh boy.

01:07:52.824 --> 01:07:55.341
LAURA: How much?

01:07:55.341 --> 01:07:56.809
TALIESIN: 150 pounds.

01:07:56.809 --> 01:08:00.785
LAURA: We got 40 pounds of black dragonhide in the
Bag of Holding.

01:08:00.785 --> 01:08:03.717
MARISHA: Well we now apparently have 150 pounds.

01:08:03.717 --> 01:08:08.255
TALIESIN: We're going to have to fill the
Whitestone coffers with some of this stuff when we

01:08:08.255 --> 01:08:09.279
get back.

01:08:09.279 --> 01:08:15.210
SAM: Grog is dumping stuff out of our Bag of
Holding.

01:08:15.210 --> 01:08:19.295
TRAVIS: So one black studded dwarven armor suit,
because Pike's the only one that wears full armor.

01:08:19.295 --> 01:08:25.804
There's another full set of regular plate armor.
That's going too. There's a totally decomposed orc

01:08:25.804 --> 01:08:35.471
head. A brain chunk, two dark elf heads, one
random arm, a piece of bulette armor.

01:08:35.471 --> 01:08:38.687
LIAM: That shit has been festering for months!

01:08:38.687 --> 01:08:41.312
TRAVIS: Twelve beef jerky strips are going.

01:08:41.312 --> 01:08:43.445
TALIESIN: I was saving that!

01:08:43.445 --> 01:08:46.719
MATT: As you're doing this, Tooma is watching you,
going--

01:08:46.719 --> 01:08:53.679
TRAVIS: By the way, this is totally up for grabs,
anytime you want. You say something to me and

01:08:53.679 --> 01:08:55.192
we'll work it out.

01:08:55.192 --> 01:09:02.746
MATT: (speaks Draconic) Another dragonborn walks
over and picks up the beef jerky strips, hands

01:09:02.746 --> 01:09:05.056
them to Tooma, and Tooma keeps watching you all,
chewing on one.

01:09:05.056 --> 01:09:07.325
LIAM: They're starving.

01:09:07.325 --> 01:09:09.683
TRAVIS: Those are super fresh.

01:09:09.683 --> 01:09:13.844
(laughter)

01:09:13.844 --> 01:09:21.818
TRAVIS: I'm throwing out a greatsword and
replacing the platinum greatsword in its spot so

01:09:21.818 --> 01:09:27.101
that should make enough weight out. Bye, black
studded dwarven armor. That was the first thing in

01:09:27.101 --> 01:09:28.703
the bag of holding.

01:09:28.703 --> 01:09:33.109
SAM: By the way, excellent note-taking and keeping
track of what's been in the bag of holding.

01:09:33.109 --> 01:09:34.212
LAURA: Yeah, that's great.

01:09:34.212 --> 01:09:35.430
MATT: Well done.

01:09:35.430 --> 01:09:38.437
TRAVIS: Half of that body part stuff came out as
gelatinous poo.

01:09:38.437 --> 01:09:41.985
MATT: Yeah, it's the gamiest of gamey meat you've
ever touched.

01:09:41.985 --> 01:09:47.582
TRAVIS: Just strings of-- You pull it up and you
got to wrap it up in the string and toss it.

01:09:47.582 --> 01:09:51.260
MATT: It is why I love the word "slough."

01:09:51.260 --> 01:09:54.865
(disgusted groaning)

01:09:54.865 --> 01:10:10.074
MATT: You guys pull away portions of that, Kima
helping out where she can. The sweat beads on her

01:10:10.074 --> 01:10:16.898
forehead; even among the cold exterior, she's a
workhorse. You also manage to pry from Vorugal's

01:10:16.898 --> 01:10:25.082
mouth 20 individual dragon teeth that are
harvestable outside of the ones the other

01:10:25.082 --> 01:10:36.400
Ravenites take for themselves. You manage to get
six dragon talons pulled from the whole body, and

01:10:36.400 --> 01:10:42.097
about-- let's see, with all the destruction of the
outside, and there is this creeping ice that's

01:10:42.097 --> 01:10:49.792
beginning to freeze the body from the inside,
post-death-- the hide includes the scales, you

01:10:49.792 --> 01:10:55.795
have to pull off the scales and destroy the hide,
and any other organs? You said the eyes, you were

01:10:55.795 --> 01:10:57.199
thinking about taking?

01:10:57.199 --> 01:11:00.475
MARISHA: Blood. Eyes.

01:11:00.475 --> 01:11:03.660
MATT: Do you have any more empty vials?

01:11:03.660 --> 01:11:07.785
TALIESIN: Empty vials? I'm out of vials.

01:11:07.785 --> 01:11:14.855
LAURA: Did you take any healing potions? If you
did you'd have an empty healing potion vial.

01:11:14.855 --> 01:11:20.238
TALIESIN: In theory then, I have three empty vials
because I did have three healing potions that I've used.

01:11:20.238 --> 01:11:23.691
MATT: We'll say you go ahead and recork three
vials of white dragon blood.

01:11:23.691 --> 01:11:25.509
TALIESIN: Thank you.

01:11:25.509 --> 01:11:26.888
MATT: Anything else?

01:11:26.888 --> 01:11:27.933
MARISHA: No.

01:11:27.933 --> 01:11:31.487
TALIESIN: I'm going to go sit down for a little
while, and breathe.

01:11:31.487 --> 01:11:33.422
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm going to go into the mansion as
well.

01:11:33.422 --> 01:11:38.941
MATT: Okay. So you guys go ahead and join Vax and
Pike. Kima comes and joins you as well, to rest

01:11:38.941 --> 01:11:42.379
for a moment, while the rest of the Ravenites
begin tearing off pieces of Vorugal's body,

01:11:42.379 --> 01:11:48.841
leaving the ribcage, the spine. They pull most of
the organs out of it, but the tree itself is

01:11:48.841 --> 01:11:52.987
rooted into the ribcage and the roots reach down
and burrow into the ground beneath it. It's left

01:11:52.987 --> 01:12:02.160
this really interesting sculpture that they've
torn everything away from. At this point now, the

01:12:02.160 --> 01:12:08.918
Ravenites have descended upon the interior of the
hoard, and they're hacking away at bits of ice to

01:12:08.918 --> 01:12:14.534
open up more of the space beneath, while keeping a
very careful eye to make sure the structure

01:12:14.534 --> 01:12:18.883
remains intact. You guys have gathered what you
decided to take from the hoard, and are doing what?

01:12:18.940 --> 01:12:27.441
TRAVIS: Scanlan. Vex. We should disable the orbs,
right?

01:12:27.441 --> 01:12:28.676
LAURA: I don't know how to.

01:12:28.676 --> 01:12:30.060
TRAVIS: Just beat the shit out of them.

01:12:30.060 --> 01:12:33.091
SAM: Wouldn't that alert Thordak?

01:12:33.091 --> 01:12:35.078
TRAVIS: We don't want to taunt him first?

01:12:35.078 --> 01:12:41.739
LAURA: I'd rather him not know, right now, that
Vorugal's dead because--

01:12:41.739 --> 01:12:48.307
SAM: He would instantly know that we're not in our
home base, he could launch an attack on that place.

01:12:48.307 --> 01:12:53.668
LAURA: Yeah. Maybe let's not do that just yet.

01:12:53.668 --> 01:12:56.518
TRAVIS: But what if he comes here?

01:12:56.518 --> 01:13:06.057
LAURA: Well if he does, hopefully they'll be
inside their caves? I don't think he's going to

01:13:06.057 --> 01:13:11.409
leave Emon to come check out what's going on with
Vorugal, unless he knows that Vorugal's dead.

01:13:11.409 --> 01:13:17.467
TRAVIS: All right. Shall we check in with the
other members first, before we biggity-bounce?

01:13:17.467 --> 01:13:21.009
LAURA: Well, let's go back to the mansion. Maybe
we can destroy it on the way out, if we feel

01:13:21.009 --> 01:13:22.572
necessary.

01:13:22.572 --> 01:13:27.322
TRAVIS: What about that big golden mast? You think
there's a golden ship under there?

01:13:27.322 --> 01:13:29.045
LAURA: What if there's a skyship in here?

01:13:29.045 --> 01:13:33.429
SAM: I assume it wouldn't fly very well, but all
right.

01:13:33.429 --> 01:13:36.963
LAURA: Maybe that's how the Ravenites can get to
Emon, if they can help us?

01:13:36.963 --> 01:13:38.551
TRAVIS: It was made of gold, right?

01:13:38.551 --> 01:13:42.555
MATT: Gold plating around it. There are portions
of it where you can see the wooden mast with large

01:13:42.555 --> 01:13:43.579
bands of gold.

01:13:43.579 --> 01:13:45.105
LAURA: Did it look like airship or normal ship?

01:13:45.105 --> 01:13:53.179
MATT: It was hard to tell. From what you could
tell, it is a mast. The airships you've seen do

01:13:53.179 --> 01:13:55.615
not have masts, since they do not use the wind.

01:13:55.615 --> 01:13:57.057
LAURA: Oh, right.

01:13:57.057 --> 01:14:04.333
MATT: So it was most likely a sea-faring ship, and
was torn asunder, from a great distance and then

01:14:04.333 --> 01:14:06.649
dragged here as part of the hoard by Vorugal.

01:14:06.649 --> 01:14:10.113
SAM: What are we going to do with a mast?

01:14:10.113 --> 01:14:16.501
LAURA: I have no idea. Maybe on the way out we can
see if it's uncovered any more.

01:14:16.501 --> 01:14:22.171
SAM: We'll stick a Google Maps pin here. We'll
always know it's here, because when we come visit

01:14:22.171 --> 01:14:27.653
Tiberius' grave, we'll also leave some flowers and
take a mast with us.

01:14:27.653 --> 01:14:32.391
LAURA: They've been working on this for a while
now, is it possible to wiggle my way in and check

01:14:32.391 --> 01:14:34.042
out the mast now?

01:14:34.042 --> 01:14:37.306
MATT: Sure, make an investigation check.

01:14:37.306 --> 01:14:45.173
LAURA: 22.

01:14:45.173 --> 01:14:51.109
MATT: You push past some of the Ravenite workers,
their shoulders don't give and you have to squeeze

01:14:51.109 --> 01:14:55.554
through. As you get there, the upper part is still
locked in ice, and the lower part is locked in

01:14:55.554 --> 01:15:01.182
ice. For how much they've carved through already,
is the central portion, but what you can see is a

01:15:01.182 --> 01:15:07.813
wooden mast with large, thick bands of gold around
it that are ornamental. You can see within them

01:15:07.813 --> 01:15:12.299
carvings and designs of a language you don't
really understand-- actually, what languages do

01:15:12.299 --> 01:15:13.698
you know?

01:15:13.698 --> 01:15:17.097
LAURA: Elvish, Common, Undercommon, Abyssal and
Draconic.

01:15:17.097 --> 01:15:23.173
MATT: You do not recognize this language, but it
appears to be ornamental, and that whatever ship

01:15:23.173 --> 01:15:33.250
this belonged to was a prized ship of either a
navy or merchant fleet. Based on some of the marks

01:15:33.250 --> 01:15:42.773
on it, it looks like it was grabbed and broken off
a ship. Looking down below, there is a portion of

01:15:42.773 --> 01:15:50.110
a ship that is beneath it as well. Much deeper,
maybe another 25 feet of solid ice below you with

01:15:50.110 --> 01:15:55.827
the rest of this hoard. There's a portion of this
ship that was dragged here by Vorugal.

01:15:55.827 --> 01:15:59.282
LAURA: That's crazy. It's a ship! I'm coming back
out.

01:15:59.282 --> 01:16:03.518
SAM: All right. Let's go back to the main group
and tell them what we've discovered.

01:16:03.518 --> 01:16:12.605
MATT: As you're hustling your way up the ravine to
the east, you pass by a number of Ravenites coming

01:16:12.605 --> 01:16:22.472
by with large sacks, and chunks of dragon meat
draped over them. You can see the meat itself is

01:16:22.472 --> 01:16:28.639
freezing the air and shoulders of those that are
carrying it. The essence of the dragon's ice-built

01:16:28.639 --> 01:16:34.912
form is causing them to constantly shift it
because it's starting to stick to their armor, and

01:16:34.912 --> 01:16:38.270
you see icicles beginning to form at the outside
of these large dragon-meat haunches that they're

01:16:38.270 --> 01:16:39.191
carrying.

01:16:39.191 --> 01:16:43.073
TRAVIS: When you dry-age meat like that, salt it
first, then hang it. Just a pro tip.

01:16:43.073 --> 01:16:47.643
MATT: (speaking Draconic). Keeps walking, doesn't
seem to understand you.

01:16:47.643 --> 01:16:50.655
TRAVIS: Really bad sinus problems.

01:16:50.655 --> 01:16:57.250
MATT: Eventually you make your way back to
Scanlan's Magnificent Mansion and gather the rest

01:16:57.250 --> 01:17:03.959
of the party. Percy, Kima, Keyleth and Vax are all
there, resting and eagerly awaiting your return.

01:17:03.959 --> 01:17:06.894
TALIESIN: I've got to try and fix my guns.

01:17:06.894 --> 01:17:08.845
MATT: Okay, make some tinkering checks.

01:17:08.845 --> 01:17:12.263
TALIESIN: Is this a misfire check or a tinkering
check, since I'm not in combat?

01:17:12.263 --> 01:17:13.627
MATT: These are tinkering checks.

01:17:13.627 --> 01:17:25.321
TALIESIN: Okay, so it's proficiency bonus, dex roll.
Ooh, 28!

01:17:25.321 --> 01:17:28.321
MATT: That's your Animus?

01:17:28.321 --> 01:17:30.161
TALIESIN: Yep, that's fine.

01:17:30.161 --> 01:17:33.534
MATT: I believe Bad News was also?

01:17:33.534 --> 01:17:38.665
TALIESIN: Yup. 26.

01:17:38.665 --> 01:17:45.693
MATT: 26 is fine. You manage to get Bad News
functioning again in the workshop below. And

01:17:45.693 --> 01:17:46.760
Retort was okay, right?

01:17:46.760 --> 01:17:48.246
TALIESIN: Yeah, Retort's fine.

01:17:48.246 --> 01:17:50.544
MATT: So as you all return and gather around--

01:17:50.544 --> 01:17:56.700
MARISHA: Keyleth has laid out the Vorgual spoils
like she got back from a yard sale.

01:17:56.700 --> 01:18:04.039
MATT: Which, by the way, is a macabre view as you
walk in, and there's this smear of dark purple

01:18:04.039 --> 01:18:12.950
dragon blood, and long, haphazardly carved chunks
of dragon hide, almost like the preset green lawn

01:18:12.950 --> 01:18:18.538
rectangles that roll out and smeared across the
center of the foyer.

01:18:18.538 --> 01:18:20.756
LAURA: I drop the Bag of Colding next to Keyleth.

01:18:20.756 --> 01:18:26.062
MARISHA: Grog, can you help me see how much we can
shove in here?

01:18:26.062 --> 01:18:27.425
TRAVIS: Shit, yeah.

01:18:27.425 --> 01:18:35.320
MARISHA: Here, maybe like a sleeping bag, and I'll
sit on it and you can wrap it up?

01:18:35.320 --> 01:18:36.701
TRAVIS: Yeah, good deal.

01:18:36.701 --> 01:18:39.121
MARISHA: Okay, we'll do that. Try and shove as
much as we can.

01:18:39.121 --> 01:18:41.185
(squishing)

01:18:41.185 --> 01:18:43.749
MATT: When it's finally wound up, it won't fit
within the Bag of Colding. The Bag of Colding is

01:18:43.749 --> 01:18:50.022
the size of a relatively large satchel. The dragon
hide, rolled up, is about that big around, what

01:18:50.022 --> 01:18:51.132
you managed to carve off.

01:18:51.132 --> 01:18:52.586
LAURA: Ah, shit. What do we do?

01:18:52.586 --> 01:18:59.218
LIAM: Can we make Percy some dragonborn armor
right now, somehow, so he can be all white, all

01:18:59.218 --> 01:19:00.073
over?

01:19:00.073 --> 01:19:03.006
TALIESIN: Wow, that would be a thing, wouldn't
it?

01:19:03.006 --> 01:19:05.561
TRAVIS: How much do you think that roll weighs?

01:19:05.561 --> 01:19:08.297
MATT: About 150 pounds.

01:19:08.297 --> 01:19:11.184
LAURA: Oh jeez. We can't carry that.

01:19:11.184 --> 01:19:13.727
TRAVIS: I could drag it behind me for a little
bit.

01:19:13.727 --> 01:19:16.053
LIAM: Scanlan, do you have a room here?

01:19:16.053 --> 01:19:17.236
SAM: A room?

01:19:17.236 --> 01:19:22.627
LIAM: For cold things? You have everything here,
do you have a chilly room?

01:19:22.627 --> 01:19:28.456
SAM: Sure, in the kitchen there's a chilly room.
The mansion will expire in 12 hours though.

01:19:28.456 --> 01:19:32.834
LAURA: We just got to go through the tree, yo.
That's it.

01:19:32.834 --> 01:19:35.086
SAM: We could bring it into the kitchen for now.

01:19:35.086 --> 01:19:38.072
TRAVIS: Can we get everything else into the Bag of
Colding, besides the roll of hide?

01:19:38.072 --> 01:19:42.276
MATT: The teeth and those things can be put in the
Bag of Holding. The only thing that needs to be

01:19:42.276 --> 01:19:43.938
preserved is the hide, until it's treated.

01:19:43.938 --> 01:19:45.588
LAURA: What about the blood?

01:19:45.588 --> 01:19:48.751
MATT: The blood's been capped. That should
probably be put in there.

01:19:48.751 --> 01:19:51.882
MARISHA: Three vials of dragon blood in the Bag of
Colding.

01:19:51.882 --> 01:19:54.048
MATT: Yeah, mark three vials of white dragon blood
in the Bag of Colding.

01:19:54.048 --> 01:19:55.578
MARISHA: And we have six talons.

01:19:55.578 --> 01:19:58.614
MATT: The talons themselves are large claws that
have been removed.

01:19:58.614 --> 01:20:02.981
MARISHA: Okay, so we have six talons, 20 teeth and
150 pounds of hide.

01:20:02.981 --> 01:20:04.652
MATT: There you go.

01:20:04.652 --> 01:20:06.722
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:20:06.722 --> 01:20:07.851
MARISHA: Word.

01:20:07.851 --> 01:20:16.251
TRAVIS: We got so much bling. We're stupid rich.

01:20:16.251 --> 01:20:18.708
SAM: A lot of things that we don't know what they
are.

01:20:18.708 --> 01:20:20.108
LIAM: What's that mask?

01:20:20.108 --> 01:20:26.726
TRAVIS: I take the mask, and like Jim Carrey in
The Mask, I stick it to my face and (yells).

01:20:26.726 --> 01:20:29.614
LIAM: Do you feel anything? What's it doing?

01:20:29.614 --> 01:20:32.150
MATT: Okay, I need you to-- no, I'm kidding.

01:20:32.150 --> 01:20:34.769
(laughter)

01:20:34.769 --> 01:20:38.254
MATT: It is chilly against your skin.

01:20:38.254 --> 01:20:43.186
TRAVIS: I feel like it's making me fall in love
with the first person I look-- Vax!

01:20:43.186 --> 01:20:47.012
LIAM: Oh, you don't want to fuck with this. Are
you sure?

01:20:47.012 --> 01:20:50.049
TRAVIS: No, you're right, I don't.

01:20:50.049 --> 01:20:52.934
LIAM: Maybe just a little bit.

01:20:52.934 --> 01:20:59.539
(laughter)

01:20:59.539 --> 01:21:04.391
TRAVIS: I take the mask off and put it in the bag
of holding. But we got this! And I hold up the

01:21:04.391 --> 01:21:06.779
big-ass platinum greatsword.

01:21:06.779 --> 01:21:07.846
LIAM: Whoa.

01:21:07.846 --> 01:21:09.981
LAURA: Can anyone identify things in our group?

01:21:09.981 --> 01:21:16.934
TALIESIN: Do I recognize the text on it?
Celestial?

01:21:16.934 --> 01:21:20.156
MATT: Celestial, yes, you do.

01:21:20.156 --> 01:21:21.862
LAURA: Oh, you can read it!

01:21:21.862 --> 01:21:24.455
SAM: When did you learn Celestial?

01:21:24.455 --> 01:21:26.100
TALIESIN: I was a very lonely child.

01:21:26.100 --> 01:21:28.333
LIAM: It's like Latin in the world of D&amp;amp;D.

01:21:28.333 --> 01:21:31.586
TRAVIS: It's like, covered with prunes, up and
down the blade.

01:21:31.586 --> 01:21:33.251
LIAM: Priss, what's it say?

01:21:33.251 --> 01:21:35.552
LAURA: Are you calling him a priss?

01:21:35.552 --> 01:21:38.636
LIAM: (laughing) Yeah.

01:21:38.636 --> 01:21:43.643
MATT: Looking across the symbols, they are
specifically symbols speaking of creation,

01:21:43.643 --> 01:21:53.752
devotion, the power of a deity's love and the
unity between god and creation. It is a very

01:21:53.752 --> 01:21:58.504
religious and holy text across the blade, both
sides.

01:21:58.504 --> 01:22:04.896
TALIESIN: This is some sort of paladin sword. It's
a holy weapon of some kind.

01:22:04.896 --> 01:22:07.107
LAURA: Oh, I bet Kima would want the shit out of
that.

01:22:07.107 --> 01:22:08.545
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, is Kima here?

01:22:08.545 --> 01:22:13.294
MATT: She's right now in the process, in the
kitchen, of massaging some of the bruising and

01:22:13.294 --> 01:22:14.669
wounds she took from the battle.

01:22:14.669 --> 01:22:16.230
SAM: Got some meat tenderizer on that?

01:22:16.230 --> 01:22:18.615
LIAM: Couple of chickens on it?

01:22:18.615 --> 01:22:27.330
TRAVIS: Stop what you're doing. I want you to get
your hands on this big, beautiful bastard. And I

01:22:27.330 --> 01:22:29.241
hand her the greatsword.

01:22:29.241 --> 01:22:33.469
MATT: "Where the heck did you get this?"

01:22:33.469 --> 01:22:36.957
TRAVIS: I could tell you, but I don't remember.

01:22:36.957 --> 01:22:51.608
MATT: "Give me a little bit of time, I need to see
if I can make this part of my communion. Hold on a

01:22:51.608 --> 01:22:57.654
"second." And she walks away, staring at the blade.
Without leaving her eyes from the scrolling on the

01:22:57.654 --> 01:23:01.851
side, walks quietly past all of you in the center
of the foyer, sits down with it and starts

01:23:01.851 --> 01:23:03.916
meditating over the blade.

01:23:03.916 --> 01:23:07.761
TRAVIS: I walk over and go, "Before you hit
anything with it, you come talk to--"

01:23:07.761 --> 01:23:09.060
MATT: (shushing)

01:23:09.060 --> 01:23:11.215
TRAVIS: I leave.

01:23:11.215 --> 01:23:12.633
TALIESIN: Anything else interesting?

01:23:12.633 --> 01:23:18.487
LAURA: I found a jewel. It's red. It looks pretty
neato.

01:23:18.487 --> 01:23:25.075
TALIESIN: How were the dragonborn about us taking
some of their--

01:23:25.075 --> 01:23:28.348
LAURA: They were great about it actually, they
were quite generous.

01:23:28.348 --> 01:23:31.335
TALIESIN: Anything else we should go back for, as
well?

01:23:31.335 --> 01:23:36.504
TRAVIS: There was possibly a giant gold ship,
underneath.

01:23:36.504 --> 01:23:37.757
TALIESIN: There was a what?

01:23:37.757 --> 01:23:45.202
SAM: Gold mast, underneath the hoard. And also,
much more gold and platinum that we can't possibly

01:23:45.202 --> 01:23:46.216
carry.

01:23:46.216 --> 01:23:52.086
LAURA: Wait, it had runes on it as well. Do they
look similar to the runes that were on Greg--

01:23:52.086 --> 01:23:54.439
Grog's sword?

01:23:54.439 --> 01:24:03.017
MATT: No, the symbols on the side of weapon look
like an ancient text, they're laid in a very

01:24:03.017 --> 01:24:09.378
ceremonial format. The text that you saw on the
side of the mast looked more like an engraving.

01:24:09.378 --> 01:24:12.188
LAURA: Did it look fluid?

01:24:12.188 --> 01:24:13.109
MATT: It was fluid.

01:24:13.109 --> 01:24:17.057
TALIESIN: There's a ship in the dragon's
collection?

01:24:17.057 --> 01:24:20.909
LAURA: Yes. I don't know if it was an entire ship,
but it was a ship.

01:24:20.909 --> 01:24:23.479
LIAM: So you didn't go in, you saw it?

01:24:23.479 --> 01:24:25.724
LAURA: Well I got down, but most of it was still
frozen.

01:24:25.724 --> 01:24:32.217
TALIESIN: I think this would be a really good
idea, before we left. If a dragon grabbed a ship,

01:24:32.217 --> 01:24:39.249
it was probably filled with something interesting.
It got his attention and he kept it.

01:24:39.249 --> 01:24:45.179
MARISHA: It could take days to potentially melt
the ice, right?

01:24:45.179 --> 01:24:46.491
TALIESIN: The ice is already melting.

01:24:46.491 --> 01:24:49.846
LIAM: Keek, you could probably melt your way in
there in 24 hours.

01:24:49.846 --> 01:24:55.071
MARISHA: And I also have this. My new toy.

01:24:55.071 --> 01:24:58.839
LAURA: We should check that out before we go.

01:24:58.839 --> 01:25:05.461
SAM: Are we in any danger staying here, leaving
our special hidey place unprotected?

01:25:05.461 --> 01:25:08.031
TALIESIN: It's not like anyone can get in here.

01:25:08.031 --> 01:25:13.122
SAM: No, I'm talking about your homeland. Leaving
it unguarded.

01:25:13.122 --> 01:25:15.898
TALIESIN: It's as guarded as it's going to be
right now.

01:25:15.898 --> 01:25:18.422
SAM: We know that Raishan's out there, doing
something.

01:25:18.422 --> 01:25:24.263
TALIESIN: She was doing something previously. I
don't think that anything awful is going to

01:25:24.263 --> 01:25:25.387
happen.

01:25:25.387 --> 01:25:28.784
TRAVIS: I also took this little keepsake. I call
it Stoneblack.

01:25:28.784 --> 01:25:30.629
SAM: Because it's a black stone?

01:25:30.629 --> 01:25:33.468
TRAVIS: Well don't fucking break it down like
that.

01:25:33.468 --> 01:25:34.858
LAURA: It's so neat.

01:25:34.858 --> 01:25:37.556
MARISHA: Does it look fancy? Is it magic?

01:25:37.556 --> 01:25:41.524
SAM: Why don't you Detect Magic, whoever can
Detect Magic?

01:25:41.524 --> 01:25:44.591
MARISHA: I can't. Wait, can I? No, I can't.

01:25:44.644 --> 01:25:47.877
SAM: I can look at it and see if it looks magical.

01:25:47.877 --> 01:25:50.746
MATT: Yeah, make an arcana check.

01:25:50.746 --> 01:25:53.595
SAM: Ooh, 20!

01:25:53.595 --> 01:26:01.189
MATT: It is not magical. However, your keen bardic
eye, looking at the gem, it is a very rare gem. It

01:26:01.189 --> 01:26:03.582
is worth quite a bit.

01:26:03.582 --> 01:26:07.928
SAM: Platinum zirconia.

01:26:07.928 --> 01:26:15.779
MATT: It's actually a black sapphire, an extremely
rare gem. It runs in the market anywhere between

01:26:15.779 --> 01:26:18.188
four to six thousand gold.

01:26:18.188 --> 01:26:23.037
TRAVIS: So anyway, I got rid of my old saltlick
rock and now I've got Stoneblack here to take its

01:26:23.037 --> 01:26:25.677
place. Do you have a pet rock?

01:26:25.677 --> 01:26:26.711
SAM: No.

01:26:26.711 --> 01:26:29.829
TRAVIS: Oh my god. I sleep with it, I put it under
my back and it gets all the knots out.

01:26:29.829 --> 01:26:31.410
LIAM: That is the cutest.

01:26:31.410 --> 01:26:34.384
SAM: Do you paint a face on it, or anything?

01:26:34.384 --> 01:26:37.953
MARISHA: I've actually had a lot of rocks that are
friends.

01:26:37.953 --> 01:26:40.297
LAURA: Oh, that's great. You can make little
clothes for it.

01:26:40.297 --> 01:26:42.517
MARISHA: Yeah, I didn't have a lot of friends
growing up.

01:26:42.517 --> 01:26:46.827
TRAVIS: Sometimes I carry it in my armpit to keep
it warm. You don't need to know about that.

01:26:46.827 --> 01:26:48.165
SAM: That's very maternal.

01:26:48.165 --> 01:26:49.447
LAURA: Oh, and these boots!

01:26:49.447 --> 01:26:52.149
SAM: Leather boots, could be anything.

01:26:52.149 --> 01:26:54.226
LAURA: Are they magic, Scanlan?

01:26:54.226 --> 01:27:03.636
SAM: Oh sure, I'll look at those. Wow, 24! Arcana
check, yeah?

01:27:03.636 --> 01:27:10.598
MATT: Yeah. They're very simple leather boots,
there's no real ornamentation beyond being

01:27:10.598 --> 01:27:15.551
functional boots. As you take a moment to look at
them, there is a faint shimmer to the leather

01:27:15.551 --> 01:27:22.316
itself. When the light hits it, the brown gives
way to a slight purplish undertone. It looks to

01:27:22.316 --> 01:27:23.971
have some sort of enchantment.

01:27:23.971 --> 01:27:25.836
LAURA: Does it seem evil or good?

01:27:25.836 --> 01:27:29.512
SAM: I have no idea. However, they look fancy.

01:27:29.512 --> 01:27:32.276
TALIESIN: They are interesting, and I'm
indifferent to such things.

01:27:32.276 --> 01:27:36.219
LAURA: I want to put one on.

01:27:36.219 --> 01:27:38.628
SAM: Go ahead, put one on, what could happen?
We're in a safe place.

01:27:38.628 --> 01:27:40.769
LAURA: I just want to see what it does.

01:27:40.769 --> 01:27:43.526
SAM: Wait, what if it's single use only?

01:27:43.526 --> 01:27:45.740
TRAVIS: Well, now's a good time.

01:27:45.740 --> 01:27:46.994
LAURA: Oh no.

01:27:46.994 --> 01:27:51.514
SAM: It's a boot, it's probably made for multiple
uses.

01:27:51.514 --> 01:27:54.782
MATT: You can take a short rest and take time with
the item to figure out what it could do, if you

01:27:54.782 --> 01:27:55.855
want to.

01:27:55.855 --> 01:27:59.953
MARISHA: I attune to my staff.

01:27:59.953 --> 01:28:04.105
MATT: Okay, so you attune to your staff. What are
you unattuning from?

01:28:04.105 --> 01:28:06.059
MARISHA: Currently my Ring of Protection.

01:28:06.059 --> 01:28:08.592
LAURA: Oh, that's painful.

01:28:08.592 --> 01:28:12.016
SAM: AC down!

01:28:12.016 --> 01:28:16.399
MATT: So all your saves are down by two, your AC
is down by two, for now. Good to know.

01:28:16.399 --> 01:28:20.939
SAM: By the way, we have two unused Ring of
Protections that we can trade for things. I have

01:28:20.939 --> 01:28:23.352
one that I haven't used in months.

01:28:23.352 --> 01:28:29.963
MATT: Like Stone of Jordans now. It's the thing
you trade. Props to you if you know what that

01:28:29.963 --> 01:28:36.087
reference was. What do you guys want to do? Do you
want to take a short rest to try and figure things out?

01:28:36.087 --> 01:28:37.870
ALL: Sure.

01:28:37.870 --> 01:28:42.257
MATT: Kima's focusing on the sword, you're
focusing on the boots.

01:28:42.257 --> 01:28:44.365
TRAVIS: I'm focusing on the war mask.

01:28:44.365 --> 01:28:46.949
MATT: Who else is doing what?

01:28:46.949 --> 01:28:48.147
TALIESIN: Is there other things?

01:28:48.147 --> 01:28:52.233
LAURA: Here's a beautiful red gem. It looks
special.

01:28:52.233 --> 01:28:55.451
TALIESIN: Does this actually look like a special
gem?

01:28:55.451 --> 01:28:57.204
MATT: Which gem is this?

01:28:57.204 --> 01:29:00.691
LAURA: The red beautiful gem you told me about.

01:29:00.691 --> 01:29:02.075
MATT: Oh, the ruby. It looks very pretty.

01:29:02.075 --> 01:29:07.031
SAM: I've got a vial with yellow and black swirly
stuff in it.

01:29:07.031 --> 01:29:09.652
TALIESIN: That requires somebody who knows
things.

01:29:09.652 --> 01:29:11.066
SAM: I'll look at that.

01:29:11.066 --> 01:29:15.482
MARISHA: Can I do a check on the potion since I've
got alchemy training?

01:29:15.482 --> 01:29:18.805
MATT: You know what? Yeah, if you wanted to take a
look.

01:29:18.805 --> 01:29:21.769
TALIESIN: There's some bracelets and such, I
thought I'd take a look.

01:29:21.769 --> 01:29:24.339
SAM: I have a gold and platinum band with braids.

01:29:24.339 --> 01:29:28.570
TALIESIN: Ah, I'll take a look at the
back-blades.

01:29:28.570 --> 01:29:30.978
SAM: The back-blades. That's nice.

01:29:30.978 --> 01:29:34.065
MATT: So Keyleth was taking a look at the
potions?

01:29:34.065 --> 01:29:38.520
LAURA: What about the bracelet, you also had a
bracelet with a sapphire?

01:29:38.520 --> 01:29:40.808
SAM: I just gave it to back-blades over here.

01:29:40.808 --> 01:29:43.655
LAURA: No, you had a ring and you had a bracelet.

01:29:43.655 --> 01:29:49.263
SAM: I have a platinum bracelet which I assumed
was just fancy and pretty. Here, look at that one

01:29:49.263 --> 01:29:50.550
too, Percy.

01:29:50.550 --> 01:29:55.969
TALIESIN: I think I can only handle one of these,
but we'll find out what happens.

01:29:55.969 --> 01:30:04.240
MATT: All right, so as you guys make a short rest.
Keyleth, you identify both potions, one of which

01:30:04.240 --> 01:30:05.809
is a Potion of Speed.

01:30:05.809 --> 01:30:09.513
MARISHA: That's what I thought it was. The yellow
one?

01:30:09.584 --> 01:30:13.589
MATT: Yep. The other is a Potion of
Invulnerability.

01:30:13.589 --> 01:30:26.262
SAM: What does it do? Read it! Out loud, with your
mouth.

01:30:26.262 --> 01:30:33.307
MARISHA: For one minute after you drink this
potion, you have resistance to all damage.

01:30:33.307 --> 01:30:34.598
LIAM: God-mode!

01:30:34.598 --> 01:30:37.907
MARISHA: The potion's syrupy liquid looks like
liquefied iron.

01:30:37.907 --> 01:30:39.343
TRAVIS: So you half all damage.

01:30:39.343 --> 01:30:40.936
MATT: Half all damage for a minute.

01:30:40.936 --> 01:30:45.892
LAURA: That is so insane.

01:30:45.892 --> 01:30:48.933
MARISHA: And then Potion of Speed: when you drink
this potion, you gain the effects of Haste spell

01:30:48.933 --> 01:30:50.386
for one minute.

01:30:50.386 --> 01:30:53.060
LAURA: I'm putting that in the party inventory.

01:30:53.060 --> 01:30:58.007
SAM: No, no, no. Hand it out to somebody. Oh, that
one should go in the party inventory.

01:30:58.007 --> 01:30:59.995
MARISHA: Which one, the Potion of Speed?

01:30:59.995 --> 01:31:02.554
LAURA: The Potion of Invulnerability, so we can
decide later.

01:31:02.554 --> 01:31:04.262
LIAM: That's for a very special day.

01:31:04.262 --> 01:31:06.201
SAM: Grog could take the speed.

01:31:06.201 --> 01:31:07.722
MARISHA: Yeah, do you want to take the speed
potion, Grog?

01:31:07.722 --> 01:31:09.129
TRAVIS: Yeah, sure, I won't use it.

01:31:09.129 --> 01:31:12.667
MARISHA: Give the invulnerability to Laura.

01:31:12.667 --> 01:31:14.139
LAURA: Oh, thank you.

01:31:14.139 --> 01:31:18.460
MATT: All right, the boots. To you, Vex.

01:31:18.460 --> 01:31:22.343
TALIESIN: So many things.

01:31:22.343 --> 01:31:31.253
LAURA: Is it Boots of Haste? (yells) Oh my god,
this is so crazy, because I was about to learn a

01:31:31.253 --> 01:31:41.462
spell, for somebody, but these take care of that.
These are Boots of Feral Leaping. When you wear

01:31:41.462 --> 01:31:47.723
these boots you can instill your leaps with
incredible bursts of power! As a bonus action you

01:31:47.723 --> 01:31:52.438
can attempt to leap. Make a strength check with a
DC of 16. If you are successful you leap either 15

01:31:52.438 --> 01:31:54.523
feet vertically or 20 feet horizontally.

01:31:54.523 --> 01:31:56.627
SAM: (meowing)

01:31:56.627 --> 01:31:58.208
TRAVIS: Do you have to attune to them?

01:31:58.208 --> 01:32:00.013
LAURA: It doesn't say!

01:32:00.013 --> 01:32:02.066
MATT: Yeah, those aren't attunement.

01:32:02.066 --> 01:32:04.616
(cheering)

01:32:04.616 --> 01:32:06.770
LAURA: There you go Grog. You need those.

01:32:06.770 --> 01:32:12.004
TRAVIS: Does anyone want the Potion of Speed? I
don't want it to be just my Christmas. That's

01:32:12.004 --> 01:32:13.340
amazing!

01:32:13.340 --> 01:32:14.880
SAM: Anyone need the Potion of Speed?

01:32:14.880 --> 01:32:16.906
MATT: If you fail the check though, you fall prone
where you stand.

01:32:16.906 --> 01:32:20.019
LAURA: Oh, that's important.

01:32:20.019 --> 01:32:23.697
MATT: Strength check, so you'll probably be okay.

01:32:23.697 --> 01:32:25.619
LIAM: Most of the time, but once in awhile--

01:32:25.619 --> 01:32:28.887
MATT: Once in a while banana peel.

01:32:28.887 --> 01:32:32.822
LAURA: I have a question, because the spell that I
was going to take, because I still have one spell

01:32:32.822 --> 01:32:42.631
that I haven't learned yet, is Jump, which triples
your jump for one minute. So if I did that, would

01:32:42.631 --> 01:32:47.429
that triple that as well? Or would it just be
Grog's normal jump?

01:32:47.429 --> 01:32:54.492
MATT: That magic would override the spell, based
on the enchantment. It's two different magical

01:32:54.492 --> 01:33:00.121
forces affecting the same thing. The Jump spell is
part of the enchantment that boot was crafted

01:33:00.121 --> 01:33:01.134
around.

01:33:01.134 --> 01:33:02.338
LAURA: Oh, so that's perfect.

01:33:02.338 --> 01:33:06.124
MATT: The platinum band is not magical.

01:33:06.124 --> 01:33:07.793
TALIESIN: Yay!

01:33:07.793 --> 01:33:16.014
MATT: But it is worth quite a bit, actually. The
platinum band is worth about 2500 gold.

01:33:16.014 --> 01:33:18.568
TALIESIN: That's a magic all its own.

01:33:18.568 --> 01:33:20.804
MATT: And the ring, who had the ring?

01:33:20.804 --> 01:33:24.078
SAM: I have a platinum bracelet?

01:33:24.078 --> 01:33:27.292
MATT: The platinum bracelet was what he looked at
right now. That's worth 2500.

01:33:27.292 --> 01:33:33.667
SAM: Oh wait, the gold platinum band? The band was
a ring? Got it.

01:33:33.667 --> 01:33:36.952
MATT: You have the ring?

01:33:36.952 --> 01:33:41.840
SAM: Yes I do. Oh, it's a thing! I'm stuck here.
Oh god.

01:33:41.840 --> 01:33:49.521
TRAVIS: The cube shrinks to half its size.

01:33:49.521 --> 01:33:51.038
LIAM: A centimeter.

01:33:51.038 --> 01:33:59.197
SAM: It's a Ring of Invisibility. While wearing
this ring you can turn invisible as an action.

01:33:59.197 --> 01:34:03.533
Anything you are wearing or carrying is invisible
with you. You remain invisible until the ring is

01:34:03.533 --> 01:34:11.423
removed, until you attack or cast a spell or until
you get Backblaze. I don't need this.

01:34:11.423 --> 01:34:13.304
LIAM: Does it say attunement on it?

01:34:13.304 --> 01:34:25.517
MATT: It does require attunement. It's a legendary
item, meaning it's extremely rare. You know how

01:34:25.517 --> 01:34:29.940
you use a spell, and once you do something the
spell's gone? That, while you're wearing it-- you

01:34:29.940 --> 01:34:35.888
can turn back invisible for another action. As many
times as you want, for as long as you wear it. So

01:34:35.888 --> 01:34:41.044
situationally, it can be very useful, if you're
trying to do infiltration or something.

01:34:41.044 --> 01:34:45.892
SAM: You can pop out, cast a spell and pop back.
But not a bonus action.

01:34:45.892 --> 01:34:51.846
MATT: No. It's less of a combat benefit,
necessarily, in some situations it may be.

01:34:51.846 --> 01:34:57.375
LIAM: Like going to a white dragon lair.

01:34:57.375 --> 01:35:00.629
MARISHA: Who wants to keep it?

01:35:00.629 --> 01:35:02.220
LAURA: Stealthy people need it, probably.

01:35:02.220 --> 01:35:03.595
MATT: Kima is happy.

01:35:03.595 --> 01:35:04.665
TRAVIS: Kima is happy?

01:35:04.665 --> 01:35:05.634
MATT: Kima is very happy.

01:35:05.634 --> 01:35:06.911
MARISHA: What'd she get?

01:35:06.911 --> 01:35:09.420
LAURA: Did you just give away something amazing?

01:35:09.420 --> 01:35:12.769
SAM: We can always take it back.

01:35:12.769 --> 01:35:16.963
MATT: As she stands up she takes the blade and
swings it. It hits the ground, and when she hits

01:35:16.963 --> 01:35:25.445
you can see a spark of divine energy from the
impact. She looks at her maul and goes, "Sorry, old

01:35:25.445 --> 01:35:34.066
"friend. You'll find a good new home. But I'd say
this Holy Avenger is going to do me quite well."

01:35:34.066 --> 01:35:36.662
MARISHA: What's it do, Kima?

01:35:36.662 --> 01:35:40.654
MATT: To give you specifics, it requires
attunement by a paladin.

01:35:40.654 --> 01:35:42.959
LAURA: Oh, so it has to be a paladin.

01:35:42.959 --> 01:35:48.348
MATT: Only really Vax or her could attune to it.
It's plus three bonus to attack and damage rolls.

01:35:48.348 --> 01:35:56.902
Hitting a fiend or undead, the creature takes an
additional 2d10 radiant damage on every hit. While

01:35:56.902 --> 01:36:00.854
you hold the drawn sword, it creates an aura in a
10ft radius around you. You and all creatures

01:36:00.854 --> 01:36:04.770
friendly to you in the aura have advantage on
saving throws against spells and magical effects.

01:36:04.770 --> 01:36:08.715
TRAVIS: Kima is now an associate member of Vox
Machina.

01:36:08.715 --> 01:36:11.466
SAM: Provisional.

01:36:11.466 --> 01:36:19.216
TRAVIS: Provisional, yeah. That's amazing. So the
maul-- Kima, because I want to respect your

01:36:19.216 --> 01:36:21.684
weapon, what does the maul do?

01:36:21.684 --> 01:36:27.313
MATT: "Oh, you want the maul?"

01:36:27.313 --> 01:36:30.949
TRAVIS: What? No, I'm just saying, what it does,
or does it just beat the shit out of people

01:36:30.949 --> 01:36:32.469
beautifully by itself?

01:36:32.469 --> 01:36:44.798
MATT: "It's my Holy Thunder Maul. It deals
additional thunder damage when I hit something.

01:36:44.798 --> 01:36:47.797
"That's about it."

01:36:47.797 --> 01:36:50.254
TRAVIS: Cool. You want me to hold onto it for you,
or are you cool?

01:36:50.254 --> 01:36:56.140
MATT: (thunk) I'm good for now.

01:36:56.140 --> 01:37:00.264
TRAVIS: Boss. Total boss moment.

01:37:00.264 --> 01:37:02.953
LAURA: She can do 100 push-ups.

01:37:02.953 --> 01:37:05.368
TRAVIS: That's true. Enjoy that.

01:37:05.368 --> 01:37:07.236
MATT: "Oh, I shall."

01:37:07.236 --> 01:37:12.407
MARISHA: I run downstairs to the training area
with my staff.

01:37:12.407 --> 01:37:14.845
TRAVIS: Anything from the war mask?

01:37:14.845 --> 01:37:19.019
MATT: No, but it is worth 750 gold.

01:37:19.019 --> 01:37:20.959
LAURA: Whoa.

01:37:20.959 --> 01:37:24.686
TRAVIS: I'll unlock its secrets. Wear him down.

01:37:24.686 --> 01:37:29.322
SAM: Well, if we're ever invited to a Masqueradé--
is that how you say it?

01:37:29.322 --> 01:37:31.082
MATT: No, but continue please.

01:37:31.082 --> 01:37:36.587
TALIESIN: Paper faces on paradé.

01:37:36.587 --> 01:37:38.457
TRAVIS: Can I get a description of it?

01:37:38.457 --> 01:37:46.879
MATT: Yeah, it resembles the Maori warrior masks
with the big open mouth, the tongue sticking out,

01:37:46.879 --> 01:37:52.601
the two pronged teeth coming up from underneath.
It's a war mask, it's meant to inspire fear and

01:37:52.601 --> 01:37:57.078
give you an ominous presence on the battlefield.

01:37:57.078 --> 01:37:58.482
SAM: Is it platinum?

01:37:58.482 --> 01:38:00.603
MATT: It's gold. Old, very old.

01:38:00.603 --> 01:38:02.102
SAM: Does it go with his hat?

01:38:02.102 --> 01:38:06.321
MATT: If you were to attach it some way, it would
look very interesting.

01:38:06.321 --> 01:38:09.175
TALIESIN: Would you like me to attach the mask to
your fine hat?

01:38:09.175 --> 01:38:11.307
LIAM: To the back of his head.

01:38:11.307 --> 01:38:12.992
LAURA: Ooh, to the back of it.

01:38:12.992 --> 01:38:16.345
LIAM: So they don't know if he's going or coming.

01:38:16.345 --> 01:38:18.677
TALIESIN: All right, bring it downstairs.

01:38:18.677 --> 01:38:23.368
MARISHA: They're both metal, right? I can help you
by heating metal, actually.

01:38:23.368 --> 01:38:25.060
TALIESIN: Yeah, let's just do this.

01:38:25.060 --> 01:38:27.773
TRAVIS: Can you also put my title on the inside?

01:38:27.773 --> 01:38:29.062
TALIESIN: Your what?

01:38:29.062 --> 01:38:30.173
TRAVIS: My title.

01:38:30.173 --> 01:38:31.288
TALIESIN: Oh yes, of course.

01:38:31.288 --> 01:38:38.142
MARISHA: I'm going to go test this out, and I'll
meet you in the workshop. I'll be right back.

01:38:38.142 --> 01:38:39.927
TRAVIS: Wait! Are you going downstairs?

01:38:39.927 --> 01:38:41.859
MARISHA: Yeah, I want to see what this does.

01:38:41.859 --> 01:38:43.077
TRAVIS: Can I come with you?

01:38:43.077 --> 01:38:44.379
TALIESIN: We're all going downstairs.

01:38:44.379 --> 01:38:46.180
MARISHA: It's a free mansion, man.

01:38:46.180 --> 01:38:48.565
LIAM: You want to have a drink with me?

01:38:48.565 --> 01:38:49.871
LAURA: Yeah, sure.

01:38:49.871 --> 01:38:56.856
MATT: So while you guys go downstairs, you two are
going to the dining area?

01:38:56.856 --> 01:38:59.984
LAURA: Is there a lounge in the mansion, is there
a bar?

01:38:59.984 --> 01:39:02.635
SAM: There's &lt;i&gt;mostly&lt;/i&gt; lounges in the mansion.

01:39:02.635 --> 01:39:05.738
LIAM: Is there an aerated wine cellar?

01:39:05.738 --> 01:39:09.937
(laughter)

01:39:09.937 --> 01:39:11.869
SAM: It's constantly aerating.

01:39:11.869 --> 01:39:17.765
(swirling)

01:39:17.765 --> 01:39:28.450
SAM: Inside joke. I'm being teased right now for
owning and using a wine aerator.

01:39:28.450 --> 01:39:33.531
TRAVIS: Whoever sold you that and said it was an
aerator is laughing their happy asses off.

01:39:33.531 --> 01:39:38.728
SAM: I appreciate fine things, and I'm not going
to apologize for that.

01:39:38.728 --> 01:39:42.237
TRAVIS: Some guy broke that off of his kid's toys
and was like "It's an aerator!"

01:39:42.237 --> 01:39:48.249
LAURA: So yes, that's where we'll go. We're going
to go to the wine room.

01:39:48.249 --> 01:39:50.732
MATT: All right, you guys find your way to the
wine room. Scanlan, what are you doing?

01:39:50.732 --> 01:39:57.898
SAM: A whole lot of nothing. I'll go down and
watch the show, I guess. I'll watch the training show.

01:39:57.898 --> 01:40:01.878
MATT: All right, you four head down to the
training room. Kima comes down to watch as well.

01:40:01.878 --> 01:40:07.521
Pike comes down, eager to watch what this new
artifact does. You head down to the training area.

01:40:07.521 --> 01:40:12.470
You have the big sandpit that's cordoned off with
the wooden outskirts, you have the various dummies

01:40:12.470 --> 01:40:18.773
set up in certain ways, you have the portion of
the room that has the armor stand on the side, the

01:40:18.773 --> 01:40:21.001
weapon stand. What do you want to do?

01:40:21.001 --> 01:40:31.907
MARISHA: Ooh-hoo. Okay. All right. Everyone stay
back. I'm going to start by casting the lowest

01:40:31.907 --> 01:40:34.130
level of spell out of it, see what it does.

01:40:34.130 --> 01:40:35.597
MATT: Which is?

01:40:35.597 --> 01:40:38.525
MARISHA: Apparently a Fireball.

01:40:38.525 --> 01:40:40.508
MATT: Okay. At where?

01:40:40.508 --> 01:40:46.147
MARISHA: Whatever is further in the sandpit. I
told everyone to stand back.

01:40:46.147 --> 01:40:50.659
MATT: Everyone stays back. Furthest part of the
sandpit is going to be one of the various combat

01:40:50.659 --> 01:40:56.629
dummies. So you launch-- put the staff down, you
guys watch as in the centerpiece at the top, where

01:40:56.629 --> 01:41:01.662
that one gem is hovering and slowly rotating in
place, the gem begins to glow bright red from its

01:41:01.662 --> 01:41:09.102
soft bluish-green composure. As it hits bright
red, this beam of familiar red arcane energy

01:41:09.102 --> 01:41:15.561
streaks forward, hits it and detonates into a
shaking explosion, destroying the wooden dummy and

01:41:15.561 --> 01:41:18.118
singeing the one immediately left to it.

01:41:18.118 --> 01:41:20.953
TRAVIS: Whoa. Cool.

01:41:20.953 --> 01:41:22.015
MARISHA: Did you see that, Grog?

01:41:22.015 --> 01:41:23.214
TRAVIS: Yeah. Really nice.

01:41:23.214 --> 01:41:24.242
MARISHA: That was awesome.

01:41:24.242 --> 01:41:26.183
TRAVIS: Was that the biggest thing it does?

01:41:26.183 --> 01:41:28.586
MATT: So that's three charges off.

01:41:28.586 --> 01:41:32.739
LAURA: How many charges are there?

01:41:32.739 --> 01:41:40.374
MARISHA: 20, and they recharge at the top of a
day. They recharge 1d6 plus four.

01:41:40.374 --> 01:41:42.600
LAURA: Oh. How many recharge a day?

01:41:42.600 --> 01:41:44.525
MARISHA: 1d6 plus four.

01:41:44.525 --> 01:41:48.338
TRAVIS: So five to ten. Five to eleven.

01:41:48.338 --> 01:41:55.229
MARISHA: Because I've been really excited about
this one, I'm going to point at the other dummy and

01:41:55.229 --> 01:41:59.011
cast Chain Lightning.

01:41:59.011 --> 01:42:03.667
MATT: Okay. As you do, you watch as this giant
bolt of electrical energy arcs off the same place

01:42:03.667 --> 01:42:09.477
on the staff, hits the dummy and the dummy
immediately bursts into flames from the energy

01:42:09.477 --> 01:42:13.577
hitting the wood, and then arcs off and hits the
two others. Suddenly the dummies are partially

01:42:13.577 --> 01:42:20.254
blown apart on one side, the charred section
slowly smoldering as smoke pours up, and you can

01:42:20.254 --> 01:42:24.338
see bits of the electrical energy going
(crackling) through the remainder of the wooden

01:42:24.338 --> 01:42:25.461
dummy.

01:42:25.461 --> 01:42:26.724
MARISHA: Grog. Did you see that?

01:42:26.724 --> 01:42:29.544
TRAVIS: Holy shit. That was amazing. I kind of
want to get out there for whatever you do next.

01:42:29.544 --> 01:42:30.629
MARISHA: Really?

01:42:30.629 --> 01:42:35.660
TRAVIS: Yeah, just to see how much damage it does.
Wait, can you use this in Minxie form too?

01:42:35.660 --> 01:42:38.765
MARISHA: Hmm, I don't think so.

01:42:38.765 --> 01:42:41.688
TRAVIS: No, you think so, or you don't?

01:42:41.688 --> 01:42:48.510
MARISHA: I can try this though! Hang on, wait,
that was five charges. No sorry, six charges.

01:42:48.510 --> 01:42:51.928
Burning through all the charges, but I don't care.

01:42:51.928 --> 01:42:54.713
TRAVIS: Do you have another one you want to do?

01:42:54.713 --> 01:42:58.437
MARISHA: Watch this Grog, watch this. I'm going to
do Conjure Elemental.

01:42:58.437 --> 01:43:01.025
MATT: Okay, and which elemental are you going to
conjure?

01:43:01.025 --> 01:43:03.506
MARISHA: What elemental?

01:43:03.506 --> 01:43:04.971
TRAVIS: Earth, big!

01:43:04.971 --> 01:43:06.025
MARISHA: Earth!

01:43:06.025 --> 01:43:16.247
MATT: You watch as she slams the staff in the
ground and you feel this quaking, and the sandpit

01:43:16.247 --> 01:43:23.340
behind her begins to slowly billow and rise up. As
the sand falls away from underneath, you see,

01:43:23.340 --> 01:43:30.377
standing behind and looming over Keyleth, this
giant, cracked stone earth elemental, very much

01:43:30.377 --> 01:43:35.367
like the form she often takes, standing behind
her. Its eyes flash up with a bright green glow

01:43:35.367 --> 01:43:37.972
and it sits there, awaiting her command.

01:43:37.972 --> 01:43:42.822
MARISHA: Then I do a bonus action and I also turn
into an earth elemental.

01:43:42.822 --> 01:43:44.470
MATT: That's right, because you got your forms
back at a short rest.

01:43:44.470 --> 01:43:45.419
MARISHA: Yes I did.

01:43:45.419 --> 01:43:48.377
MATT: So now she turns into the same form. There's
now two elementals there.

01:43:48.377 --> 01:43:49.430
SAM: Fight, fight, fight!

01:43:49.430 --> 01:43:51.231
MARISHA: Then we walk by and we Top Gun each
other.

01:43:51.231 --> 01:43:58.698
MATT: Each slam itself causes the air around to
(cracking) like a small thunderwave in its own right.

01:43:58.698 --> 01:44:01.436
MARISHA: Then we both turn and look at Grog.

01:44:01.436 --> 01:44:05.900
TRAVIS: That was &lt;i&gt;amazing&lt;/i&gt;.

01:44:05.900 --> 01:44:07.750
MARISHA: Then I punch Grog in the face!

01:44:07.750 --> 01:44:09.031
LIAM: Yes!

01:44:09.031 --> 01:44:11.179
MATT: Go ahead and roll an attack.

01:44:11.179 --> 01:44:14.363
MARISHA: Natural one!

01:44:14.363 --> 01:44:18.299
TALIESIN: That's not a spell attack, is it?

01:44:18.299 --> 01:44:19.697
MARISHA: That was for me!

01:44:19.697 --> 01:44:26.048
MATT: And for the other elemental, what's your
bonus? As an earth elemental, what's your attack

01:44:26.048 --> 01:44:28.777
bonus? Because the other elemental is going to
punch him at the same time too.

01:44:28.777 --> 01:44:31.115
MARISHA: He gets a plus eight.

01:44:31.115 --> 01:44:35.502
MATT: Plus eight? That's a 16, that does not. So
here's what happens. In slow motion, Grog stands

01:44:35.502 --> 01:44:43.202
there with a big grin on his face, and both fists
go (slamming) and glide off, no impact. And you're

01:44:43.202 --> 01:44:45.525
still dumbfounded and enjoying the moment.

01:44:45.525 --> 01:44:46.669
TRAVIS: Keyleth.

01:44:46.669 --> 01:44:49.381
MARISHA: (gruffly) I did that on purpose.

01:44:49.381 --> 01:44:51.301
TRAVIS: Can I understand what she's saying?

01:44:51.301 --> 01:44:53.402
MATT: No, you hear (rockslide crashing).

01:44:53.402 --> 01:44:56.954
SAM: Wow, she can become far-sighted earth
elementals.

01:44:56.954 --> 01:45:01.623
(laughter)

01:45:01.623 --> 01:45:03.968
SAM: Amazing.

01:45:03.968 --> 01:45:07.066
MARISHA: Okay, I drop my form to hear what Grog
has to say.

01:45:07.066 --> 01:45:12.858
TRAVIS: That sucked. That was the worst one of all
of them.

01:45:12.858 --> 01:45:14.101
MARISHA: Really?

01:45:14.101 --> 01:45:14.944
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:45:14.944 --> 01:45:16.201
MARISHA: Did it hurt you when we punched you?

01:45:16.201 --> 01:45:18.505
TRAVIS: No, like-- wait, is the beard all right?

01:45:18.505 --> 01:45:21.371
MATT: The beard is fine.

01:45:21.371 --> 01:45:25.877
TRAVIS: Yeah, okay, no. It's all good. Does it do
anything else than whiff?

01:45:25.877 --> 01:45:30.379
MARISHA: Well. And I tell the elemental to--

01:45:30.379 --> 01:45:37.113
TALIESIN: No, it does nothing else.

01:45:37.113 --> 01:45:38.354
LAURA: Nothing.

01:45:38.354 --> 01:45:40.121
MARISHA: Attack Grog again.

01:45:40.121 --> 01:45:42.093
TRAVIS: Let me turn around.

01:45:42.093 --> 01:45:45.713
MATT: That is an 18.

01:45:45.713 --> 01:45:48.973
MARISHA: Fucking shit.

01:45:48.973 --> 01:45:55.268
MATT: It doesn't miss, what it does is it hits you
and you're like (slamming). You barely felt it.

01:45:55.268 --> 01:45:56.537
MARISHA: How was that?

01:45:56.537 --> 01:46:00.636
TRAVIS: Oh man, yeah. Really, whew. Stout.

01:46:00.636 --> 01:46:02.072
MARISHA: Really? Yeah?

01:46:02.072 --> 01:46:04.889
TRAVIS: Yeah. I'm questioning my faith now.

01:46:04.889 --> 01:46:07.275
MARISHA: Man, this staff is so powerful.

01:46:07.275 --> 01:46:08.509
TRAVIS: Yeah, sure is.

01:46:08.509 --> 01:46:09.759
MARISHA: Jeez, wow.

01:46:09.759 --> 01:46:19.410
TRAVIS: Not that I want to feel any more damage
after that hurricane of pain, but does it do

01:46:19.410 --> 01:46:20.730
&lt;i&gt;anything&lt;/i&gt; else?

01:46:20.730 --> 01:46:23.626
MARISHA: I can keep burning the fucking charges.

01:46:23.626 --> 01:46:26.813
MATT: By the way, you've now burned 14 charges.

01:46:26.813 --> 01:46:28.431
MARISHA: Yes, I know.

01:46:28.431 --> 01:46:29.852
TRAVIS: Give me one really big one.

01:46:29.852 --> 01:46:33.419
MARISHA: Goddamn it. I hope we're not fighting
anything so I can recharge these.

01:46:33.419 --> 01:46:36.478
LAURA: It's going to be like three days for her to
get them back.

01:46:36.478 --> 01:46:40.068
SAM: Does this thing protect you at all?

01:46:40.068 --> 01:46:44.343
MARISHA: No, it's a damage-dealer.

01:46:44.343 --> 01:46:50.462
LAURA: Don't do any more. Don't waste any more,
Marisha. Don't do it.

01:46:50.462 --> 01:46:51.715
LIAM: You're not there.

01:46:51.715 --> 01:46:53.484
LAURA: That's why I said Marisha.

01:46:53.484 --> 01:47:03.275
MARISHA: I'm going to wait. I'm going to see. I'm
going to save some action. Real fast, just in

01:47:03.275 --> 01:47:05.912
case-- and I whack him with the staff.

01:47:05.912 --> 01:47:07.439
TRAVIS: Like Rafiki?

01:47:07.439 --> 01:47:15.167
MATT: All right, go ahead and roll a d20. Add your
strength modifier and your proficiency modifier.

01:47:15.167 --> 01:47:25.550
MARISHA: My strength and my-- Let's see, 18. No
wait, 19!

01:47:25.550 --> 01:47:27.105
MATT: 19. What's your AC, Grog?

01:47:27.105 --> 01:47:28.138
TRAVIS: 20.

01:47:28.138 --> 01:47:29.775
ALL: Aww.

01:47:29.775 --> 01:47:30.772
MATT: Whack!

01:47:30.772 --> 01:47:45.072
TRAVIS: (melodramatic groaning) Oh, the pain of--
what's this thing called? Confires! It hurts so much.

01:47:45.072 --> 01:47:47.378
MARISHA: Wow, really?

01:47:47.378 --> 01:47:50.876
TRAVIS: I feel the reflux-- the conflux.

01:47:50.876 --> 01:47:53.153
MARISHA: Oh, it gave you acid reflux?

01:47:53.153 --> 01:47:56.372
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's real bad. I have to leave
because I feel like I might toss.

01:47:56.372 --> 01:47:58.949
MARISHA: That's good to know. It induces
sickness?

01:47:58.949 --> 01:48:01.375
TRAVIS: Yeah, I feel like I'm going to cry too.

01:48:01.375 --> 01:48:04.123
MARISHA: Okay, good to know, all right, thank
you.

01:48:04.123 --> 01:48:07.605
TRAVIS: And I leave, holding my forehead and
laughing. Small, little laugh.

01:48:07.605 --> 01:48:09.743
MARISHA: I'm good for now.

01:48:09.743 --> 01:48:11.772
MATT: Percy, you're going to the workshop, you
said?

01:48:11.772 --> 01:48:15.132
TALIESIN: Yeah, grabbing the helmets and here, I'm
going to borrow you.

01:48:15.132 --> 01:48:16.388
MARISHA: And now I go.

01:48:16.388 --> 01:48:20.567
MATT: So you guys go and do that. In the meantime,
both of you find your way to Scanlan's wine room.

01:48:20.567 --> 01:48:28.393
(aerating noises and laughter)

01:48:28.393 --> 01:48:32.184
LIAM: I don't know what any of these are; do you
know what's good and what's bad?

01:48:32.184 --> 01:48:33.903
LAURA: Pick the one that looks the fanciest.

01:48:33.903 --> 01:48:36.153
LIAM: You were better at that than I am.

01:48:36.153 --> 01:48:43.874
LAURA: I go to the corner-- the highest shelf, I
don't fucking know. These are probably all fake

01:48:43.874 --> 01:48:47.762
wine anyway. I fly up and grab the one on the
highest shelf and fly back down.

01:48:47.762 --> 01:48:57.055
MATT: You grab it, look at the label. It's a Pinot
Noir, and the title of the brand says Le White Meat.

01:48:57.055 --> 01:49:00.041
LAURA: Oh no, it's chicken wine. Fuck.

01:49:00.041 --> 01:49:01.698
TRAVIS: Oh no, is it really?

01:49:01.698 --> 01:49:04.628
LAURA: Whatever, we'll drink it anyway. It's going
to be disgusting.

01:49:04.628 --> 01:49:10.304
TALIESIN: There's actually a drink called Cock
Ale, which is brewed in a dead chicken.

01:49:10.304 --> 01:49:11.778
TRAVIS: Of &lt;i&gt;course&lt;/i&gt; you would know that.

01:49:11.778 --> 01:49:17.694
MATT: No, it's regular red wine. But definitely is
labelled with a chicken on it.

01:49:17.694 --> 01:49:18.930
LAURA: That's funny.

01:49:18.930 --> 01:49:21.975
LIAM: I'm grabbing a random Two Buck Chuck next to
me on the wall.

01:49:21.975 --> 01:49:25.972
MATT: Same label. They're all the same wine.

01:49:25.972 --> 01:49:31.142
LIAM: Hey, hey, hey. To Vex'ahlia, the dragon
slayer.

01:49:31.142 --> 01:49:32.303
LAURA: Fuck yes!

01:49:32.303 --> 01:49:34.198
LIAM: (slamming) Oh shite, we should do it for
real.

01:49:34.198 --> 01:49:36.605
LAURA: Oh yeah, right, what's up?

01:49:36.605 --> 01:49:39.206
LIAM: Oh man, I'm proud of you.

01:49:39.206 --> 01:49:40.385
LAURA: Thanks!

01:49:40.385 --> 01:49:41.506
LIAM: Yeah.

01:49:41.506 --> 01:49:43.446
LAURA: Is that all you wanted to say?

01:49:43.446 --> 01:49:44.376
LIAM: No.

01:49:44.376 --> 01:49:45.526
LAURA: I didn't think so.

01:49:45.526 --> 01:49:46.854
LIAM: Well, that's three of five.

01:49:46.854 --> 01:49:52.351
LAURA: Yeah.

01:49:52.351 --> 01:49:55.904
LIAM: I don't know if we're all going to live, but
I think that collectively we might actually pull

01:49:55.904 --> 01:49:57.192
it off.

01:49:57.192 --> 01:49:59.444
LAURA: I think we have a good shot of it.

01:49:59.444 --> 01:50:03.905
LIAM: Yeah. Almost bit it, out there.

01:50:03.905 --> 01:50:06.295
LAURA: Yeah, I noticed.

01:50:06.295 --> 01:50:07.482
LIAM: Again.

01:50:07.482 --> 01:50:09.737
LAURA: Yes. Scary.

01:50:09.737 --> 01:50:12.729
LIAM: Can I have a hug?

01:50:12.729 --> 01:50:14.436
LAURA: I'm glad you're not dead.

01:50:14.436 --> 01:50:21.226
LIAM: Yeah, old news. We've done it before, we'll
do it again. Hey, do you want to try jumping

01:50:21.226 --> 01:50:22.899
around with those boots?

01:50:22.899 --> 01:50:24.176
LAURA: Oh, I gave them to Grog.

01:50:24.176 --> 01:50:26.051
LIAM: You want to try to jump around anyway?

01:50:26.051 --> 01:50:27.277
LAURA: Sure.

01:50:27.277 --> 01:50:29.265
LIAM: What can you do? How high can you go?

01:50:29.265 --> 01:50:33.551
LAURA: I jump. It's a jump. A normal little jump.

01:50:33.551 --> 01:50:34.988
LIAM: It's good, yeah.

01:50:34.988 --> 01:50:36.405
LAURA: Why?

01:50:36.405 --> 01:50:38.639
LIAM: No reason, I'm procrastinating.

01:50:38.639 --> 01:50:41.225
LAURA: Oh, yeah. So tell me what you're
procrastinating about?

01:50:41.225 --> 01:50:44.430
LIAM: How long are you going to torture yourself
for?

01:50:44.430 --> 01:50:58.149
LAURA: Oh, you fuck. (laughing) What? (muffled)
What are you even talking about right now? Do you

01:50:58.149 --> 01:51:02.908
want to see how high I can jump now? So high. I
get on my broom and I fly up to the ceiling.

01:51:02.908 --> 01:51:06.714
LIAM: Push out the wings. No, I can't!

01:51:06.714 --> 01:51:08.241
MATT: Yeah, you already used it.

01:51:08.241 --> 01:51:09.952
LIAM: Will you come down here and talk to me?

01:51:09.952 --> 01:51:13.771
LAURA: (groans) Fine, fine! Hi.

01:51:13.771 --> 01:51:16.723
LIAM: Yeah. What are you doing?

01:51:16.723 --> 01:51:21.132
LAURA: I don't know! I don't-- what?

01:51:21.132 --> 01:51:26.509
LIAM: You know I've known for a while? It's all
over your face, I've known you since you were a

01:51:26.509 --> 01:51:28.283
baby, I've known for a while.

01:51:28.283 --> 01:51:31.303
LAURA: Okay. (nervous laughter)

01:51:31.303 --> 01:51:37.133
LIAM: I've almost died. You &lt;i&gt;have&lt;/i&gt; died.

01:51:37.133 --> 01:51:38.256
LAURA: Yes.

01:51:38.256 --> 01:51:39.217
LIAM: He died.

01:51:39.217 --> 01:51:40.077
LAURA: Yes.

01:51:40.077 --> 01:51:41.802
LIAM: What are you fucking doing, Vex?

01:51:41.802 --> 01:51:45.714
LAURA: (sighs) It's just timing, you know? It's
all timing.

01:51:45.714 --> 01:51:50.101
LIAM: Timing could have you dead in the ground
tomorrow.

01:51:50.101 --> 01:51:51.634
LAURA: This is true.

01:51:51.634 --> 01:51:56.579
LIAM: And do you know something? Hey.

01:51:56.579 --> 01:51:57.840
LAURA: Hmm?

01:51:57.840 --> 01:52:01.507
LIAM: He leads with this. Not with that.

01:52:01.507 --> 01:52:02.979
LAURA: His collarbone?

01:52:02.979 --> 01:52:12.909
LIAM: Yeah. Fucking smart-ass. Maybe he'll
surprise you, but I don't know.

01:52:12.909 --> 01:52:18.407
LAURA: I think he isn't thinking that way at all,
and honestly--

01:52:18.407 --> 01:52:23.779
LIAM: (snorts) You're a dummy. I'm the dummy, why
are you such a dummy?

01:52:23.779 --> 01:52:36.137
LAURA: I don't know, darling. It seems so trivial.
Doesn't it?

01:52:36.137 --> 01:52:47.040
LIAM: What the fuck do we have in this world
except for moments with each other? That's all

01:52:47.040 --> 01:52:48.617
we've got.

01:52:48.617 --> 01:52:49.942
LAURA: Yeah.

01:52:49.942 --> 01:52:54.822
LIAM: I want you to have some happiness in your
life.

01:52:54.822 --> 01:52:56.700
LAURA: I &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; have happiness!

01:52:56.700 --> 01:53:03.998
LIAM: I want you to have a little more. There's no
reason to hold back. Why?

01:53:03.998 --> 01:53:07.503
LAURA: Wouldn't it be so awkward though?

01:53:07.503 --> 01:53:13.267
LIAM: Who cares? You know what's awkward?

01:53:13.267 --> 01:53:14.467
LAURA: Hmm?

01:53:14.467 --> 01:53:16.557
LIAM: A life not lived.

01:53:16.557 --> 01:53:24.273
LAURA: Hey, I'm living a life. I've got Trinket.
I've got you, sometimes, when you're not with

01:53:24.273 --> 01:53:26.167
Keyleth.

01:53:26.167 --> 01:53:41.259
LIAM: Listen, you're my sister, and I love you
very much, and I know a lot about you, and I can

01:53:41.259 --> 01:53:46.217
help you in a lot of ways. But not every way.

01:53:46.217 --> 01:53:47.675
LAURA: I know.

01:53:47.675 --> 01:53:52.037
LIAM: There are facets of you that have nothing to
do with me.

01:53:52.037 --> 01:53:55.395
LAURA: Very few.

01:53:55.395 --> 01:54:03.974
LIAM: I want you to be happy, and we all could be
dead in a week. You know that.

01:54:03.974 --> 01:54:06.149
LAURA: Yeah.

01:54:06.149 --> 01:54:10.420
LIAM: I'm a fucking idiot. I don't know anything.

01:54:10.420 --> 01:54:13.990
LAURA: (laughing) I want you to remember that you
just said that.

01:54:13.990 --> 01:54:21.007
LIAM: I never forget it. Ever. In the game or out
of the game, Laura.

01:54:21.007 --> 01:54:22.976
LAURA: Oh, don't!

01:54:22.976 --> 01:54:35.183
LIAM: It's a short life we got. I'm not going to
tell you what to do, but I won't tell you what to

01:54:35.183 --> 01:54:39.411
do. I do want you to be happy.

01:54:39.411 --> 01:54:43.784
LAURA: Thank you. And I'll try.

01:54:43.784 --> 01:54:51.079
LIAM: And on a side note-- he's a little fucked
up.

01:54:51.079 --> 01:54:52.406
LAURA: Oh, I know.

01:54:52.406 --> 01:54:55.470
LIAM: And he &lt;i&gt;only&lt;/i&gt; listens to you.

01:54:55.470 --> 01:54:57.781
LAURA: Well, that's not true.

01:54:57.781 --> 01:54:58.741
LIAM: Yes it is.

01:54:58.741 --> 01:54:59.619
LAURA: No!

01:54:59.619 --> 01:55:00.908
LIAM: Who does he listen to?

01:55:00.908 --> 01:55:03.148
LAURA: Keyleth. They're like, so close.

01:55:03.148 --> 01:55:08.345
LIAM: Yeah, they enjoy each other's company, I
know that, but you're really the only one who he

01:55:08.345 --> 01:55:19.627
listens to. So I need you to-- he has impulses. He
has impulse control. I have impulse control.

01:55:19.627 --> 01:55:20.750
LAURA: Yes you do!

01:55:20.750 --> 01:55:22.313
LIAM: He has a different kind of impulse control.

01:55:22.313 --> 01:55:31.214
LAURA: Okay. You want me to control him then. Get
him under my thumb. Bring him to the light, just a

01:55:31.214 --> 01:55:32.636
little bit?

01:55:32.636 --> 01:55:34.498
LIAM: You know what I'm talking about.

01:55:34.498 --> 01:55:36.403
LAURA: I know what you're talking about.

01:55:36.403 --> 01:55:41.440
LIAM: I take another bottle of wine and I
(gulps).

01:55:41.440 --> 01:55:43.876
LAURA: (laughing) I thank you.

01:55:43.876 --> 01:55:47.218
LIAM: Am I drunk, am I at disadvantage now, if do
the whole bottle?

01:55:47.218 --> 01:55:49.970
MATT: In a minute you will be, yeah.

01:55:49.970 --> 01:55:51.290
LIAM: Grab another bottle.

01:55:51.290 --> 01:55:56.569
LAURA: Hm? Glug glug glug? Well, all right.

01:55:56.569 --> 01:56:02.410
LIAM: (groans) I want to go see some fireballs get
shot, I'll see you later!

01:56:02.410 --> 01:56:04.345
LAURA: Okay, have fun.

01:56:04.345 --> 01:56:05.675
LIAM: Woo!

01:56:05.675 --> 01:56:12.500
MATT: As Vax sloppily leaves the room, you're left
in quiet, by yourself with your--

01:56:12.500 --> 01:56:14.611
LIAM: (booming) And I walk away!

01:56:14.611 --> 01:56:22.448
LAURA: I pop Trinket out, cast Speak with Animals
and have a nice fun conversation with him.

01:56:22.448 --> 01:56:28.690
MATT: We're going to go ahead and take a break
here, come back here in a minute, use the

01:56:28.690 --> 01:56:29.733
restroom.

01:56:29.733 --> 01:56:31.188
MARISHA: Aw, we haven't done shit!

01:56:31.188 --> 01:56:39.998
MATT: That's not true. You've discussed the spoils
from your last major story bit, so we'll be back

01:56:39.998 --> 01:56:43.651
here in a few minutes. We're going to go ahead and
take a restroom break, fill up on drinks. Stay

01:56:43.651 --> 01:56:45.560
tuned and we'll see you in a minute.

01:56:45.560 --> 02:14:30.243
[break]

02:14:30.243 --> 02:14:35.659
MATT: Hello, everyone and welcome back to Critical
Role! After a barrage of delightful phrases that

02:14:35.659 --> 02:14:40.090
were just shouted at me. It's great.

02:14:40.090 --> 02:14:41.184
TRAVIS: Love you, Matt!

02:14:41.184 --> 02:14:46.690
MATT: Love you too, guys. I do want to say real
fast that our wonderful Kiki Day, who made a

02:14:46.690 --> 02:14:48.273
number of other Vestiges--

02:14:48.273 --> 02:14:49.613
LAURA: Fenthras!

02:14:49.613 --> 02:14:51.481
MATT: Made Fenthras, made--

02:14:51.481 --> 02:14:52.619
MARISHA: And the Spire!

02:14:52.619 --> 02:14:55.247
MATT: Made the Spire of Conflux, which you can see
on Marisha's twitter right now?

02:14:55.247 --> 02:14:56.293
MARISHA: Geek &amp;amp; Sundry's twitter.

02:14:56.293 --> 02:14:59.643
MATT: Geek &amp;amp; Sundry's twitter. As well as making
me a belt buckle that I'm going to be wearing at

02:14:59.643 --> 02:15:00.783
Blizzcon.

02:15:00.783 --> 02:15:03.681
(yelling)

02:15:03.681 --> 02:15:05.558
MATT: That's fucking fantastic.

02:15:05.558 --> 02:15:07.000
TRAVIS: That's a badass motherfucking belt.

02:15:07.000 --> 02:15:08.654
MATT: (McCree voice) Just saying.

02:15:08.654 --> 02:15:12.393
LIAM: (Oprah voice) Spire of Conflux!

02:15:12.393 --> 02:15:15.375
MATT: (McCree voice) Now I've got a reason to go
ahead and wear myself a tucked-in shirt.

02:15:15.375 --> 02:15:23.262
(normal voice) Anyway, let's get into the game. You guys,
finishing those scenes. Taking a short rest. You

02:15:23.262 --> 02:15:27.556
roll your hit dice to heal up a bit. What more do
you wish to accomplish? What's your next plan of

02:15:27.556 --> 02:15:29.284
action, Vox Machina?

02:15:29.284 --> 02:15:34.072
TALIESIN: I say we pack up all of our things and
raid a ship.

02:15:34.072 --> 02:15:39.274
LAURA: And then head back to Whitestone. I mean-- 
Oh, no, we're fine in here.

02:15:39.274 --> 02:15:41.033
SAM and LAURA: Are we?

02:15:41.033 --> 02:15:43.836
MARISHA: Do you want to rest before we do that?

02:15:43.836 --> 02:15:44.851
TALIESIN: I say we--

02:15:44.851 --> 02:15:49.894
SAM: We have to rest. We're all severely injured.

02:15:49.894 --> 02:15:55.815
TALIESIN: Well, some of us, yes. I say we take a
night, we hit the ship and then head home.

02:15:55.815 --> 02:15:58.048
LIAM: It's good wine!

02:15:58.048 --> 02:15:59.518
LAURA: Oh, he's drunk.

02:15:59.518 --> 02:16:02.150
MARISHA: You guys got into the wine?!

02:16:02.150 --> 02:16:04.500
SAM: Did you aerate it first?

02:16:04.500 --> 02:16:06.223
LIAM: How do you do that?

02:16:06.223 --> 02:16:12.139
SAM: If you don't have an aerator, you can put it
in a mason jar and shake it up a bit.

02:16:12.139 --> 02:16:13.948
LIAM: We just drank it out of the bottle.

02:16:13.948 --> 02:16:17.207
SAM: Well, that's just pedestrian, really.

02:16:17.207 --> 02:16:18.810
LAURA: You have so many.

02:16:18.810 --> 02:16:22.513
TALIESIN: Put some ice in it, keep it cold.

02:16:22.513 --> 02:16:25.130
MARISHA: Are we still melting a mask to a helmet?

02:16:25.130 --> 02:16:28.367
TALIESIN: We had a little bit of metallurgy to
do.

02:16:28.367 --> 02:16:32.530
MATT: Make a tinkering check, and this, actually,
make--

02:16:32.530 --> 02:16:37.359
MARISHA: I help him with my Heat Metal spell like
a soldering iron.

02:16:37.359 --> 02:16:45.026
MATT: Okay! That being the case, it's going to
help with the metal's pliability. Go ahead and

02:16:45.026 --> 02:16:46.683
make your regular dex-based.

02:16:46.683 --> 02:16:48.009
TALIESIN: Regular dex-based? All right.

02:16:48.009 --> 02:16:50.942
MATT: Would make it strength-based for the metal,
but the Heat Metal is helping you with that.

02:16:50.942 --> 02:16:52.159
TALIESIN: All right.

02:16:52.159 --> 02:16:53.957
MARISHA: Big money, no whammies!

02:16:53.957 --> 02:16:55.943
TALIESIN: That's a 26.

02:16:55.943 --> 02:17:01.371
MATT: 26? Yeah, without an issue you manage to
apply the mask onto the back of the helmet after

02:17:01.371 --> 02:17:09.254
looking at some brief glances at the shape of
Grog's head, making sure that it has a hinge so if

02:17:09.254 --> 02:17:16.238
he leans forward, it doesn't restrict or press
into his back if he looks up. It is a functional

02:17:16.238 --> 02:17:19.944
backmask onto his delightful pointed helmet.

02:17:19.944 --> 02:17:25.197
TALIESIN: I've also carved, in Elven, in the
inside, "Kick Me."

02:17:25.197 --> 02:17:27.785
MATT: On the inside of the mask?

02:17:27.785 --> 02:17:29.669
TALIESIN: Yeah. So it's there.

02:17:29.669 --> 02:17:31.689
MARISHA: It's magnificent.

02:17:31.689 --> 02:17:33.004
TALIESIN: I think so.

02:17:33.004 --> 02:17:34.357
MARISHA: Shall we present it to him?

02:17:34.357 --> 02:17:35.472
TALIESIN: Yes, let's.

02:17:35.472 --> 02:17:40.189
MARISHA: I feel like we should go at this with a
little bit of theatricality. Just because it's so

02:17:40.189 --> 02:17:41.613
much fun to fuck with Grog.

02:17:41.613 --> 02:17:42.639
TALIESIN: I know!

02:17:42.639 --> 02:17:43.731
MARISHA: How do you want to do this?

02:17:43.731 --> 02:17:44.735
TALIESIN: I don't know.

02:17:44.735 --> 02:17:49.319
MARISHA: Oh! I turn into an elephant. Get on my
back!

02:17:49.319 --> 02:17:52.638
TALIESIN: Did you say that before turning into an
elephant?

02:17:52.638 --> 02:17:55.205
MARISHA: Yes, I do! Get on my back!

02:17:55.205 --> 02:17:58.586
LIAM: (elephant sound)

02:17:58.586 --> 02:18:05.743
TALIESIN: For god's sake, Vax, stop aerating more
wine! We've had enough! &lt;i&gt;You've&lt;/i&gt; had enough!

02:18:05.743 --> 02:18:08.678
MATT: Sam is so over it.

02:18:08.678 --> 02:18:11.889
TALIESIN: No, never!

02:18:11.889 --> 02:18:17.761
MARISHA: Percy's on my back and I'm an elephant
holding the mask while we go find Grog.

02:18:17.761 --> 02:18:20.437
MATT: Well, first you get to the doorway of the
workshop.

02:18:20.437 --> 02:18:25.438
MARISHA: It's a temporary fucking mansion. I bust
through.

02:18:25.438 --> 02:18:27.433
MATT: Make a strength check.

02:18:27.433 --> 02:18:35.761
MARISHA: I don't know how to-- Will you put this
in dice jail for me?

02:18:35.761 --> 02:18:37.068
LAURA: You got it.

02:18:37.068 --> 02:18:38.459
MATT: What'd you roll?

02:18:38.459 --> 02:18:39.798
MARISHA: I don't know. What do I roll for a--

02:18:39.798 --> 02:18:43.115
MATT: Look it up. You add your strength modifier
as an elephant.

02:18:43.115 --> 02:18:45.725
MARISHA: Well, I don't know what an elephant's
stats are!

02:18:45.725 --> 02:18:50.750
MATT: I'm going to find it right now. I'm going to
find for you what an elephant's stats are! Just

02:18:50.750 --> 02:18:51.906
going to go look it up for you!

02:18:51.906 --> 02:18:53.107
MARISHA: Well, I rolled a two!

02:18:53.107 --> 02:18:54.175
MATT: You rolled a what, a two?

02:18:54.175 --> 02:18:55.143
MARISHA: Yeah, a two.

02:18:55.143 --> 02:18:56.360
SAM: It's not going to work!

02:18:56.360 --> 02:18:58.262
MARISHA: I'm a fucking elephant and it's a door!

02:18:58.262 --> 02:19:05.469
MATT: It's plus six because it has a strength of
22 because it's a goddamn elephant. So eight. You

02:19:05.469 --> 02:19:12.346
(slam). It lurches ever so slightly, but that is a
very strong doorway. It's almost like the arcane

02:19:12.346 --> 02:19:14.487
nature of Scanlan's magic makes a good home.

02:19:14.487 --> 02:19:15.822
MARISHA: Can I try it again?

02:19:15.822 --> 02:19:18.518
MATT: You hit it again. Make another strength
check.

02:19:18.518 --> 02:19:23.181
MARISHA: That's much better! 16 total!

02:19:23.181 --> 02:19:31.845
MATT: 16. It causes some of the plaster to crack.
Doesn't get that much further, but you're starting

02:19:31.845 --> 02:19:33.058
to get a serious headache.

02:19:33.058 --> 02:19:35.567
TRAVIS: Are we hearing this? Are we hearing a
massive commotion?

02:19:35.567 --> 02:19:39.345
MATT: You're starting to hear it now. There's this
low, general slamming sound in the mansion.

02:19:39.345 --> 02:19:40.440
LAURA: What is that?

02:19:40.440 --> 02:19:41.945
TRAVIS: Yeah, do you hear that?

02:19:41.945 --> 02:19:45.826
SAM: I do. Doesn't sound right.

02:19:45.826 --> 02:19:47.427
LAURA: Should we go find out?

02:19:47.427 --> 02:19:50.221
SAM: I pull out Mythcarver and run down the
stairs!

02:19:50.221 --> 02:19:52.175
TRAVIS: I take out the bloodaxe and I follow him!

02:19:52.175 --> 02:19:53.799
MATT: Another strength check.

02:19:53.799 --> 02:19:58.164
MARISHA: They get better with each time. 19!

02:19:58.164 --> 02:20:04.926
MATT: 19. The door gets knocked partially off of
its hinges and the frame is now slightly bent

02:20:04.926 --> 02:20:09.820
forward. The wood is splintered and the stone has
more cracks into it. The headache is now

02:20:09.820 --> 02:20:11.124
pounding.

02:20:11.124 --> 02:20:12.666
MARISHA: I should have thought about this!

02:20:12.666 --> 02:20:18.297
MATT: You guys hear another, even louder slam this
time. As you rush down to the outside of Percy's

02:20:18.297 --> 02:20:25.483
workshop you see some crazed, large, shifting gray
movement of some creature, on the other side of

02:20:25.483 --> 02:20:26.326
the doorway.

02:20:26.326 --> 02:20:27.625
TRAVIS: Jesus! Scanlan, is this one yours?

02:20:27.625 --> 02:20:30.289
SAM: No. It's definitely an intruder.

02:20:30.289 --> 02:20:34.645
TRAVIS: Then we fucking kill it! We race forward
and attack.

02:20:34.645 --> 02:20:36.607
MATT: All right, both of you guys roll a--

02:20:36.607 --> 02:20:38.612
LIAM: Wait, is Percy still riding?

02:20:38.612 --> 02:20:41.146
MATT: You don't see Percy, because Percy's above
you!

02:20:41.146 --> 02:20:47.417
TALIESIN: Am I aware of this happening? At
all, I don't see them at all?

02:20:47.417 --> 02:20:51.236
MATT: No, because you're inside the workshop and
you're above the doorframe she's slamming into.

02:20:51.236 --> 02:20:52.481
TRAVIS: 23.

02:20:52.481 --> 02:20:53.836
SAM: One.

02:20:53.836 --> 02:21:02.846
MATT: So Scanlan, you go running with Mythcarver
in the air, and as you go to strike, Grog shoves

02:21:02.846 --> 02:21:08.122
you out of the way, in the middle of his angry
grab and you go skidding across the ground,

02:21:08.122 --> 02:21:14.737
Mythcarver spinning out of your grasp across the
floor. Are you making a single attack or are you

02:21:14.737 --> 02:21:16.461
doing a full round of attacks on this beast?

02:21:16.461 --> 02:21:19.097
TRAVIS: This is a giant beast, I'm giving it what
for!

02:21:19.097 --> 02:21:21.672
MATT: So roll another attack, are you raging for
this?

02:21:21.672 --> 02:21:27.863
TRAVIS: No, I'm not raging. (laughing) 24.

02:21:27.863 --> 02:21:31.596
MATT: Okay, both hit. Go ahead and roll damage on
both attacks, non-rage damage.

02:21:31.596 --> 02:21:37.030
MARISHA: No, go with it. Go with it.

02:21:37.030 --> 02:21:39.046
TRAVIS: 20 points, four points of necrotic.

02:21:39.046 --> 02:21:40.330
LAURA: Oh god.

02:21:40.330 --> 02:21:42.359
TRAVIS: I know, I don't hit lightly.

02:21:42.359 --> 02:21:44.502
SAM: Elephant's going to die.

02:21:44.502 --> 02:21:49.223
TRAVIS: 22 points of damage.

02:21:49.223 --> 02:21:54.777
MATT: You take 42 points of damage from your
maximum of 76 hit points as an elephant, as all of

02:21:54.777 --> 02:21:57.941
a sudden, what little bit of vision you have
through the pounding headache, you glance through

02:21:57.941 --> 02:22:02.148
in time to see Grog's form (roaring) run up and
slam his axe into you twice.

02:22:02.148 --> 02:22:04.573
MARISHA: How much damage?

02:22:04.573 --> 02:22:06.017
MATT: 42.

02:22:06.017 --> 02:22:07.320
MARISHA: What's my form?

02:22:07.320 --> 02:22:08.355
MATT: 76.

02:22:08.355 --> 02:22:12.424
MARISHA: I fucking headbutt him, I'm going to
gorge him! Let's go!

02:22:12.424 --> 02:22:14.027
MATT: You're going to gorge him?

02:22:14.027 --> 02:22:16.279
TRAVIS: Scanlan!

02:22:16.279 --> 02:22:19.732
SAM: Careful Grog, it has some protection magic on
it. It threw me across the room!

02:22:19.732 --> 02:22:26.581
(laughter)

02:22:26.581 --> 02:22:34.705
MATT: All right, Marisha. I would like you to roll
for a gore attack against Grog.

02:22:34.705 --> 02:22:38.161
LAURA: This is ridiculous.

02:22:38.161 --> 02:22:40.079
MARISHA: What do I add? I don't have a stat.

02:22:40.079 --> 02:22:40.972
MATT: Plus eight.

02:22:40.972 --> 02:22:42.066
MARISHA: 18.

02:22:42.066 --> 02:22:47.284
MATT: 18? No, I don't think that hits you. So you
go ahead and try and gore Grog, and Grog ducks

02:22:47.284 --> 02:22:49.972
right beneath the two giant ivory horns.

02:22:49.972 --> 02:22:52.056
MARISHA: Do I knock down the doorway a little bit
more?

02:22:52.056 --> 02:22:53.771
MATT: Make a strength check.

02:22:53.771 --> 02:22:56.112
MARISHA: Okay. 20 total.

02:22:56.112 --> 02:23:02.713
MATT: With that, as you duck below, the elephant
slams through the archway, sending stone and

02:23:02.713 --> 02:23:08.120
pieces of wood flying, and stumbles past. You duck
down to try and the avoid the attack, going

02:23:08.120 --> 02:23:12.672
underneath the elephant as it begins to stomp over
you into the room. You see this as you spin

02:23:12.672 --> 02:23:16.822
around. The elephant bursts in, and it is very
much an elephant, you can see now, with Percy on

02:23:16.822 --> 02:23:19.190
top being dragged through the rubble.

02:23:19.190 --> 02:23:22.646
TALIESIN: I'm thankfully wearing a helmet.

02:23:22.646 --> 02:23:25.092
SAM: It's got Percival!

02:23:25.092 --> 02:23:27.739
TRAVIS: Roll off! Roll off, Percy!

02:23:27.739 --> 02:23:31.811
TALIESIN: (deadpan) Oh help. Help, please.

02:23:31.811 --> 02:23:33.884
TRAVIS: He's so weak he can barely speak!

02:23:33.884 --> 02:23:36.080
SAM: We must kill this elephant.

02:23:36.080 --> 02:23:37.752
TRAVIS: We must destroy this beast!

02:23:37.752 --> 02:23:39.689
MATT: Scanlan and Grog, what are you doing?

02:23:39.689 --> 02:23:42.753
TRAVIS: Come on, buddy.

02:23:42.753 --> 02:23:44.782
SAM: We got to kill this thing.

02:23:44.782 --> 02:23:46.517
TRAVIS: Yeah, you go. Come on.

02:23:46.517 --> 02:23:51.670
SAM: I will throw a Wand of Fireballs at it.

02:23:51.670 --> 02:23:53.692
MATT: How many charges does it have left?

02:23:53.692 --> 02:23:55.958
SAM: Oh, plenty. I have only used one of seven.

02:23:55.958 --> 02:24:07.128
MATT: But each time you use it-- okay. Not quite
how it works, I don't think.

02:24:07.128 --> 02:24:14.407
LIAM: Just look at the shirt, Matt, just look at
his shirt.

02:24:14.407 --> 02:24:18.813
MATT: Oh, you're right. One charge is a third
level spell, I misunderstood. So you launch your

02:24:18.813 --> 02:24:20.348
Fireball, go ahead and roll damage.

02:24:20.348 --> 02:24:25.637
SAM: Oh wait, what is the damage? It's 8d6. Got
it.

02:24:25.637 --> 02:24:31.254
MATT: 8d6. Keyleth, I need you to roll a d20 minus
one.

02:24:31.254 --> 02:24:37.512
MARISHA: Don't fuck me, Gil. Rolling your die!
Wait, a d20 minus one? (laughing) Six total.

02:24:37.512 --> 02:24:39.066
Goddamn it Gil.

02:24:39.066 --> 02:24:41.526
MATT: Okay. Percy, I need you to roll a dexterity
saving throw.

02:24:41.526 --> 02:24:52.854
TALIESIN: That's not bad, that's 18.

02:24:52.854 --> 02:24:54.895
MATT: Okay, what was the damage you said?

02:24:54.895 --> 02:24:55.928
SAM: 26.

02:24:55.928 --> 02:24:59.371
MATT: I need you to roll a dexterity saving throw,
with advantage.

02:24:59.371 --> 02:25:02.637
TRAVIS: Natural 20.

02:25:02.637 --> 02:25:06.385
MARISHA: I'm still wearing my cloak, so do they
get disadvantage on attacks against me? Because

02:25:06.385 --> 02:25:07.713
I'm in the Cloak of Displacement.

02:25:07.713 --> 02:25:08.991
SAM: You're an elephant though.

02:25:08.991 --> 02:25:10.421
TALIESIN: You're an elephant in the Cloak of
Displacement.

02:25:10.421 --> 02:25:14.374
MARISHA: But whenever I Beast Shape I absorb my
items.

02:25:14.374 --> 02:25:22.652
MATT: That would have been something to mention
earlier, so going forward the attacks will have

02:25:22.652 --> 02:25:25.007
disadvantage, but you have to remember that for it
to have an effect.

02:25:25.007 --> 02:25:26.528
MARISHA: But they're just now rolling.

02:25:26.528 --> 02:25:31.442
MATT: He hasn't attacked yet, he's rolling because
a Fireball just blew up in his face!

02:25:31.442 --> 02:25:33.160
TRAVIS: I got a natural 20, so I'm good.

02:25:33.160 --> 02:25:35.556
MATT: So that's half damage to you. You said it
was 26 damage?

02:25:35.556 --> 02:25:36.565
SAM: 26.

02:25:36.565 --> 02:25:42.102
MATT: So 13 points of fire damage to Percy and
Grog, and a full 26 points of fire damage to you.

02:25:42.102 --> 02:25:52.326
That puts you at a total of 42 plus 26, so 68.
You're still up. The elephant that's now storming

02:25:52.326 --> 02:25:56.478
through the center-- hold on, I have to go with
the battle music for this now.

02:25:56.478 --> 02:25:58.919
SAM: Where's your battle map?

02:25:58.919 --> 02:26:04.718
MATT: --storming through the center of the foyer,
is now spinning around, flames exploding,

02:26:04.718 --> 02:26:12.527
engulfing Percy, Grog. The elephant is now covered
in blood and scrapes. That finishes your go. Grog,

02:26:12.527 --> 02:26:13.510
you're up.

02:26:13.510 --> 02:26:18.913
SAM: Before I'm done I'm going to inspire Grog and
say: Grog, remember. They never forget!

02:26:18.913 --> 02:26:25.008
(laughter)

02:26:25.008 --> 02:26:27.893
MATT: Take your d12 inspiration.

02:26:27.893 --> 02:26:34.277
TRAVIS: Thank you. I'll take two strikes at the
elephant's ass. That's a one.

02:26:34.277 --> 02:26:35.455
MATT: With disadvantage.

02:26:35.455 --> 02:26:37.051
TRAVIS: Oh. Well, that's a one, so.

02:26:37.051 --> 02:26:38.689
MATT: I know. You still have the second attack.

02:26:38.689 --> 02:26:41.147
TRAVIS: That's a two.

02:26:41.147 --> 02:26:44.951
MARISHA: (heavy footsteps)

02:26:44.951 --> 02:26:46.321
MATT: So as you go--

02:26:46.321 --> 02:26:48.991
LAURA: Wait, it's not a two!

02:26:48.991 --> 02:26:54.303
TRAVIS: So the second one was 16, the first one
was a 15.

02:26:54.303 --> 02:27:01.191
MATT: It still hits. You rolled a two and it still
hits because its AC is 12. It's very big and easy

02:27:01.191 --> 02:27:02.785
to hit. Go ahead and roll damage on the next
attack.

02:27:02.785 --> 02:27:04.620
TRAVIS: Oh, nice. What a joy!

02:27:04.620 --> 02:27:06.088
TALIESIN: It's not hard to hit an elephant.

02:27:06.088 --> 02:27:09.199
LIAM: Can we also say that the two winos have come
down to watch?

02:27:09.199 --> 02:27:11.364
LAURA: Yeah, we're staring from the top of the
stairs at all of it happening.

02:27:11.364 --> 02:27:14.599
TRAVIS: The first one is 20, with four points of
necrotic damage.

02:27:14.599 --> 02:27:15.710
MATT: You only hit with one.

02:27:15.710 --> 02:27:16.568
TRAVIS: Oh, that's right.

02:27:16.568 --> 02:27:17.688
MATT: How much was that, 20 points?

02:27:17.688 --> 02:27:18.577
TRAVIS: Yeah, 20.

02:27:18.577 --> 02:27:27.975
MATT: Okay, so Keyleth, you yourself take 12
points of damage. As your axe swings through and

02:27:27.975 --> 02:27:34.612
slams into the elephant, the elephant's form
suddenly vanishes, as your axe cleaves through

02:27:34.612 --> 02:27:39.497
Keyleth a little bit, causing her to fall back and
catch herself.

02:27:39.497 --> 02:27:41.774
LAURA: Is Percy still on her back, piggy-backing?

02:27:41.774 --> 02:27:44.752
MATT: In a second, Percy goes (thud) on the ground
next to you.

02:27:44.752 --> 02:27:46.103
MARISHA: (pained noise)

02:27:46.103 --> 02:27:50.473
TRAVIS: Percy, you've been riding Raishan! Die,
evil witch!

02:27:50.473 --> 02:27:53.188
LAURA: Grog! It's Keyleth.

02:27:53.188 --> 02:27:59.981
MARISHA: Oh, Grog, thank you! That elephant ate
me! You saved me!

02:27:59.981 --> 02:28:00.932
TRAVIS: I did?

02:28:00.932 --> 02:28:02.079
MARISHA: You did.

02:28:02.079 --> 02:28:08.822
TRAVIS: Sometimes I don't know if you guys would
live without me. I'm really glad I'm around,

02:28:08.822 --> 02:28:09.915
sometimes.

02:28:09.915 --> 02:28:13.524
TALIESIN: I can't imagine it. I legitimately
cannot imagine it.

02:28:13.524 --> 02:28:14.797
TRAVIS: Ooh, is that my helmet?!

02:28:14.797 --> 02:28:16.023
TALIESIN: It is!

02:28:16.023 --> 02:28:23.018
LIAM: Ayy, Fredrickstein the Science Guy, nice
job! Look at that! That is beautiful.

02:28:23.018 --> 02:28:24.511
LAURA: (whispering) He's drunk.

02:28:24.511 --> 02:28:26.459
MARISHA: The elephant ate this too.

02:28:26.459 --> 02:28:28.468
TALIESIN: It's Dr. Fredrickstein, please.

02:28:28.468 --> 02:28:31.594
TRAVIS: Is there poo on it?

02:28:31.594 --> 02:28:35.652
MARISHA: No, it's good.

02:28:35.652 --> 02:28:37.955
TALIESIN: It's clean. It's perfectly reasonable.

02:28:37.955 --> 02:28:43.560
TRAVIS: Ooh, the mask's on the back. Did you write
on the inside like I said?

02:28:43.560 --> 02:28:46.183
TALIESIN: It is engraved in Elven on the inside,
it's lovely.

02:28:46.183 --> 02:28:51.773
TRAVIS: It looks like writing. What's it--

02:28:51.773 --> 02:28:53.128
TALIESIN: It's your title, sir.

02:28:53.128 --> 02:28:54.840
TRAVIS: --is that? What language?

02:28:54.840 --> 02:28:56.529
LAURA: Oh, that? It's Elvish.

02:28:56.529 --> 02:29:00.236
TRAVIS: Oh, it's Elvish? So not everybody knows
what my title is.

02:29:00.236 --> 02:29:02.150
TALIESIN: It's meant to be secret.

02:29:02.150 --> 02:29:05.785
TRAVIS: Very smart. Did you see my title?

02:29:05.785 --> 02:29:07.104
LAURA: I did, it's impressive.

02:29:07.104 --> 02:29:08.851
MARISHA: I wrote it down.

02:29:08.851 --> 02:29:10.052
TALIESIN: Did you? Oh dear.

02:29:10.052 --> 02:29:11.505
MARISHA: I knew it was going to be handy.

02:29:11.505 --> 02:29:15.158
TRAVIS: I will put on the new mask slash horned
helm.

02:29:15.158 --> 02:29:18.231
MATT: It feels impressive.

02:29:18.231 --> 02:29:19.465
TRAVIS: Does it?

02:29:19.465 --> 02:29:20.312
MATT: Yeah.

02:29:20.312 --> 02:29:25.985
TRAVIS: Actually, because now the mask is facing
the back, right? Can I fucking turn it around and

02:29:25.985 --> 02:29:30.842
put the mask on the front, with the horn sticking
out the back like a big Nike swoosh?

02:29:30.842 --> 02:29:34.454
MATT: You can. It's not as comfortable, but it
definitely feels badass.

02:29:34.454 --> 02:29:36.360
TRAVIS: (muffled) I don't feel like this is the
best--

02:29:36.360 --> 02:29:39.054
TALIESIN: You sound very intimidating.

02:29:39.054 --> 02:29:42.320
LIAM: He got polymorphed into De Niro.

02:29:42.320 --> 02:29:45.025
(laughter)

02:29:45.025 --> 02:29:49.370
TALIESIN: Oh my god.

02:29:49.370 --> 02:29:54.970
SAM: I feel like I'm going to have to write some
house rules from now on.

02:29:54.970 --> 02:29:58.215
TALIESIN: It'd be good to have a list of things to
ignore, I agree.

02:29:58.215 --> 02:30:02.812
LIAM: You need some of those blue guys with an
aerator at all times down in those cellars.

02:30:02.812 --> 02:30:04.025
SAM: Blue man group?

02:30:04.025 --> 02:30:07.703
LIAM: One of your blue guys! The blue guys! That
disappears with this place--

02:30:07.703 --> 02:30:16.244
SAM: My hundreds of--? There's no guys here.
They're all female servants. I don't know how many

02:30:16.244 --> 02:30:17.622
times I need to say this.

02:30:17.622 --> 02:30:22.865
LIAM: Well, nobody farted in our wine tonight. We
had to drink it regular.

02:30:22.865 --> 02:30:31.494
SAM: I am sorry for your loss, because it's really
excellent once you let it breathe and open up.

02:30:31.494 --> 02:30:33.412
LIAM: It's pretty good right now.

02:30:33.412 --> 02:30:40.633
TRAVIS: Well, now that I got my helmet, are we
going down to the ship?

02:30:40.633 --> 02:30:46.188
TALIESIN: I propose that we have an evening's
rest. In the morning--

02:30:46.188 --> 02:30:47.754
LIAM: We should go now.

02:30:47.754 --> 02:30:51.523
LAURA: No. Maybe you need to rest.

02:30:51.523 --> 02:30:54.047
TALIESIN: No, I think we need an evening's rest.

02:30:54.047 --> 02:30:55.756
LIAM: I have 25 hit points. I'm fine!

02:30:55.756 --> 02:31:00.806
LAURA: Yeah. Well, Pike is resting because she was
hurt quite badly.

02:31:00.806 --> 02:31:03.852
LIAM: Yeah, but did you see her fun buns, though?
I did those.

02:31:03.852 --> 02:31:05.338
LAURA: I didn't.

02:31:05.338 --> 02:31:06.651
TALIESIN: You did her fun buns?

02:31:06.651 --> 02:31:08.564
LIAM: Yeah, I pulled little fun buns--

02:31:08.564 --> 02:31:10.137
TALIESIN: Oh! Okay! That's good--

02:31:10.137 --> 02:31:11.870
LIAM: What do you think I meant?

02:31:11.870 --> 02:31:13.293
TALIESIN: I didn't think anything, I'm going
up.

02:31:13.293 --> 02:31:16.859
LIAM: What else does fun buns mean except for
little, cute, little hairballs on your hair?

02:31:16.859 --> 02:31:18.536
SAM: I'll give you a book later.

02:31:18.536 --> 02:31:20.131
LAURA: Oh, yeah! You have a book?

02:31:20.131 --> 02:31:23.651
SAM: I have a few. I have a library.

02:31:23.651 --> 02:31:30.559
LIAM: Oh, gosh! Neither Vax nor Liam knew there
was anything other than little cute hair buns--

02:31:30.559 --> 02:31:34.118
Fun buns. What is a "fun bun" besides a fun bun?

02:31:34.118 --> 02:31:36.719
MATT:	Ask Larkin.

02:31:36.719 --> 02:31:40.410
LIAM: You guys! We got to find Larkin!

02:31:40.410 --> 02:31:47.619
MATT: Okay. All right, so you guys take your long
rest. You regain your spells, you're all full hit

02:31:47.619 --> 02:31:55.422
points, you regain half your max hit dice. So if
you spent more than half of your hit dice, you still--

02:31:55.422 --> 02:32:01.115
LAURA: Do we keep our hit dice from our Heroes'
Feast? If we never got rid of them? Or are they gone?

02:32:01.115 --> 02:32:03.668
MATT: No. By the time you'd wake up, they'd be
gone, probably.

02:32:03.668 --> 02:32:08.414
LIAM: Can you use the hit-- never mind.

02:32:08.414 --> 02:32:18.102
SAM: When they wake up in the morning, Vax has a
bill under his door for three bottles of wine. And

02:32:18.102 --> 02:32:23.794
Vex for one bottle. And Keyleth for a construction
bill of 5,000 gold pieces.

02:32:23.794 --> 02:32:30.692
LAURA: I promptly rip the fuck out of my bill.

02:32:30.692 --> 02:32:33.954
MARISHA: I think it's a scam, and I throw it
away.

02:32:33.954 --> 02:32:35.023
MATT: Okay.

02:32:35.023 --> 02:32:37.089
SAM: It is a scam.

02:32:37.089 --> 02:32:40.390
(laughter)

02:32:40.390 --> 02:32:50.621
MATT: All right. Well-rested. A fresher day. The
mansion, growing fairly close to probably

02:32:50.621 --> 02:32:53.973
expending the rest of its magic. What do you guys
do?

02:32:53.973 --> 02:32:57.824
TALIESIN: Let's pack our things, head down and
take a look at that pirate ship, then head home.

02:32:57.824 --> 02:33:02.177
Well, that ship. I don't know if it has pirate
symbols, but I'm very excited.

02:33:02.177 --> 02:33:06.608
MARISHA: So wait, do we need things-- how far
under the ice is it?

02:33:06.608 --> 02:33:11.807
TALIESIN: Probably a bit. Having the ability to
melt some ice would probably be helpful. Also,

02:33:11.807 --> 02:33:18.090
you're going to have to do the tree teleport and
possibly we want to deal with reforestation of

02:33:18.090 --> 02:33:19.073
some kind.

02:33:19.073 --> 02:33:22.943
MARISHA: Reforestation. Oh, sure because the Ice
Age wiped out--

02:33:22.943 --> 02:33:26.386
TALIESIN: We have to go out like Captain EO. It's
a thing.

02:33:26.386 --> 02:33:27.622
MARISHA: Yeah!

02:33:27.622 --> 02:33:31.887
SAM: Just throwing this out there, is there
anything to gain by going up to the dragon lair

02:33:31.887 --> 02:33:35.494
and communicating with Thordak? Is there anything
we want to say to him?

02:33:35.494 --> 02:33:37.344
LAURA and TALIESIN: No.

02:33:37.344 --> 02:33:39.400
SAM: Misdirection? Taunting? Anything?

02:33:39.400 --> 02:33:41.828
TRAVIS: Like, you suck. You can find us at the
Glintshore?

02:33:41.828 --> 02:33:46.640
LIAM:	We don't even want to take an hour for
me to slip this on and go see if there's anything

02:33:46.640 --> 02:33:48.249
of value?

02:33:48.249 --> 02:33:49.270
SAM: Up in the lair?

02:33:49.270 --> 02:33:50.267
LIAM: Yes.

02:33:50.267 --> 02:33:53.486
LAURA: You can do that while we look at the ship.

02:33:53.486 --> 02:33:55.525
TALIESIN: Not a bad idea.

02:33:55.525 --> 02:34:01.083
SAM: But don't go alone. You can still get
hit with traps.

02:34:01.083 --> 02:34:05.622
LIAM: I can look for those. I do like buddies to
go. Do you need to go to the boat?

02:34:05.622 --> 02:34:07.516
TALIESIN: It's all in the same place.

02:34:07.516 --> 02:34:09.447
LAURA: Yeah. It's all in the same place.

02:34:09.447 --> 02:34:11.305
SAM: I can hover above you or something.

02:34:11.305 --> 02:34:13.360
TRAVIS: Let's jauntily head over.

02:34:13.360 --> 02:34:16.862
TALIESIN: If there's a problem, we can call the
others. We won't be that far away.

02:34:16.862 --> 02:34:22.788
LIAM: All right. Ooh! I slip Whisper into my pack
and I put this ring on.

02:34:22.788 --> 02:34:25.099
SAM: (whispers) Ooh! Precious!

02:34:25.099 --> 02:34:29.302
LAURA: Right, so you have to attune to that.

02:34:29.302 --> 02:34:30.530
LIAM: (Gollum voice) Nasty!

02:34:30.530 --> 02:34:31.492
TALIESIN: Thank you.

02:34:31.492 --> 02:34:32.621
LIAM: (Gollum voice) Nasty!

02:34:32.621 --> 02:34:35.777
TRAVIS: Nasty woman.

02:34:35.777 --> 02:34:40.700
LIAM: (Gollum voice) She's a nasty woman!

02:34:40.700 --> 02:34:44.852
(laughter)

02:34:44.852 --> 02:34:46.620
TALIESIN: Oh, I may need a ringtone later.

02:34:46.620 --> 02:34:52.271
MATT: Yeah. All right, great. So you guys have put
yourselves together. Kima and Pike joined you

02:34:52.306 --> 02:34:59.624
downstairs in the foyer. You make your way back
out into the ravine just as the magic of the mansion

02:34:59.624 --> 02:35:07.586
fades. There you can see most of the dragon bones
picked entirely off the corpse of Vorugal, except

02:35:07.586 --> 02:35:14.585
for the ribcage, still remaining as a landmark of
the battle that took place with a central tree

02:35:14.585 --> 02:35:16.321
still sprouting from the top of it.

02:35:16.321 --> 02:35:19.482
LAURA: Is it any bigger?

02:35:19.482 --> 02:35:26.096
MATT: No, the magic of Fenthras creates the tree and
it stays that size as it sprouts. Who knows if over

02:35:26.096 --> 02:35:32.822
time it may grow? You haven't had the time to
really tell. You guys make your way--

02:35:32.822 --> 02:35:34.689
MARISHA: I didn't know you are an artist.

02:35:34.689 --> 02:35:35.797
LAURA: It's quite lovely, isn't it?

02:35:35.797 --> 02:35:37.991
MARISHA: It's pretty amazing, yes. I appreciate
this.

02:35:37.991 --> 02:35:40.991
LAURA: You're welcome. I did it for you, Keyleth.

02:35:40.991 --> 02:35:46.240
TALIESIN: Certainly adds something, doesn't
it? To the whole valley. It's quite nice.

02:35:46.240 --> 02:35:47.869
TRAVIS: Yeah. Green.

02:35:47.869 --> 02:35:53.620
MATT: The weather has cleared up. There's breaks
in the clouds. It's still mostly cloud-covered,

02:35:53.620 --> 02:36:00.172
but you do see glimpses of blue sky here and
there. Still cold, still see your breath out in

02:36:00.172 --> 02:36:08.612
the air. But the temperature does feel slightly
warmer than it was the day before. You begin to

02:36:08.612 --> 02:36:15.247
walk down to the ravine center on the north side
of the ravine where Vorugal's lair once resided.

02:36:15.247 --> 02:36:20.356
You can see hundreds of footprints, up and down, through 
the snow, through the ravine; looks like there's been a lot

02:36:20.356 --> 02:36:28.419
of foot traffic to and from while you guys were
resting. You make your way to the ice throne of

02:36:28.419 --> 02:36:36.216
Vorugal and you see a portion of it has collapsed
inward. But you also see a lot of foot traffic

02:36:36.216 --> 02:36:41.910
around, most of the ice spires that remained up
there have been broken. The remaining Draconian

02:36:41.910 --> 02:36:46.553
corpses that were adorning them were taken down,
or aren't in sight. And you can see there are a few

02:36:46.553 --> 02:36:52.660
remaining dragonborn Ravenites that are stepping
in and out of the cavern-like chamber that you

02:36:52.660 --> 02:36:56.495
largely punched through and they continued to
excavate it into the night.

02:36:56.495 --> 02:37:03.647
TALIESIN: If you could let them know that we're
going to make one last venture into the ship and

02:37:03.647 --> 02:37:05.123
then we'll be on our way.

02:37:05.123 --> 02:37:12.366
LAURA: I walk up to one of the guys going in, and
say in Draconic, have you unearthed the giant

02:37:12.366 --> 02:37:13.803
ship yet?

02:37:13.803 --> 02:37:25.329
MATT: He looks for a second and says, "It is
nothing for us. But we've worked around it." He

02:37:25.329 --> 02:37:30.408
points down, and you can see the portion of it that
has collapsed, filled in part at the side and

02:37:30.408 --> 02:37:37.273
shoveled out in these large chunks of ice that 
are sitting outside of this cavern area. Parts of the

02:37:37.319 --> 02:37:43.869
ship have been moved around-- it looks like it's
been somewhat damaged. It's not a full ship. It's a

02:37:43.869 --> 02:37:52.388
large portion of a ship. It looks like in whatever
battle or attack that Vorugal took this ship,

02:37:52.388 --> 02:37:59.802
it destroyed a huge portion of it in doing so and
took the rest of it with it, in pieces. And it is

02:37:59.802 --> 02:38:08.220
a very pretty ship. It looks like it may have been
the jewel of a navy somewhere. And here it resides.

02:38:08.220 --> 02:38:18.519
However, it does appear like the ship has seen
many moons since it was originally taken, if that

02:38:18.519 --> 02:38:23.492
makes any sense. Like, it wasn't brought directly
here. It looks like almost a keepsake that

02:38:23.492 --> 02:38:26.057
Vorugal has moved from lair to lair.

02:38:26.057 --> 02:38:27.978
LIAM: (whispers) Oh, that's legit!

02:38:27.978 --> 02:38:30.112
MATT: Has some sort of sentimental value.

02:38:30.112 --> 02:38:35.517
LAURA: Oh, wow! It had some engraving on it. You
speak a lot of languages, right?

02:38:35.517 --> 02:38:39.272
TALIESIN: Well. I speak a couple of languages, I
read a couple.

02:38:39.272 --> 02:38:40.501
MARISHA: What is it?

02:38:40.501 --> 02:38:42.972
TALIESIN: Does it look familiar?

02:38:42.972 --> 02:38:45.459
MATT: What languages do you know?

02:38:45.459 --> 02:38:47.136
TALIESIN: Celestial, Elven, Common.

02:38:47.136 --> 02:38:51.242
MARISHA: Sylvan, Primordial, Druidic, Elven.

02:38:51.242 --> 02:38:53.115
TRAVIS: Giant, Common.

02:38:53.115 --> 02:38:56.081
SAM: Gnomish. That's it.

02:38:56.081 --> 02:39:00.222
MATT: You don't even know Common. No one has
understood you this entire game!

02:39:00.222 --> 02:39:03.692
LAURA: Pike speaks Dwarvish.

02:39:03.692 --> 02:39:06.586
MATT: Pike does pick up on it. It is Dwarvish
text.

02:39:06.586 --> 02:39:10.174
TRAVIS: I speak Dwarvish, but I can't read.

02:39:10.174 --> 02:39:12.383
MATT: That is a problem.

02:39:12.383 --> 02:39:13.946
TRAVIS: I have a belt, yeah.

02:39:13.946 --> 02:39:22.922
MATT: It is Dwarven, and as Pike begins reading
around it, this-- it's the name of the ship across

02:39:22.922 --> 02:39:33.488
the mast, which is "The Floebreaker." This ship
appears to have been, at least in some way, shape, or

02:39:33.488 --> 02:39:43.038
form, designed as a means of travelling through very
far north icy regions, meant to break through

02:39:43.038 --> 02:39:49.039
elements of heavy glacier flows and such. The
construction of it, as you get closer to the

02:39:49.039 --> 02:39:53.633
actual bit of the ship that is there, you can see
it's very heavily reinforced with metal and has a

02:39:53.633 --> 02:40:01.894
very rigid structure to it. The fine scrolling
that you saw before, it looks to be partially

02:40:01.894 --> 02:40:06.197
filled with ice at times. So as soon as it broke
away, you could see it's actually more of a harsh,

02:40:06.197 --> 02:40:16.111
broken Dwarvish runic writing to it. The ship has
definitely seen a lot of wear and tear. That's

02:40:16.154 --> 02:40:18.070
about as much you can make out of it.

02:40:18.070 --> 02:40:20.840
LAURA: Can we get inside of it? Is there anything
to see inside of it?

02:40:20.840 --> 02:40:23.922
MATT: You can attempt to climb inside if you want to.

02:40:23.970 --> 02:40:25.289
MARISHA: How much is exposed right now?

02:40:25.289 --> 02:40:31.449
MATT: Just the top of the deck, and where the
mast connects to the-- that portion is still

02:40:31.449 --> 02:40:38.639
frozen into the upper part of the throne.
There is no entrance immediately visible, but you can

02:40:38.639 --> 02:40:42.564
break through some more ice or try to break
through the actual deck to get there.

02:40:42.564 --> 02:40:46.979
MARISHA: I cast a Flaming Sphere.

02:40:46.979 --> 02:40:54.960
MATT: Okay. A flaming ball begins to roll on the
bridge of the ship.

02:40:54.960 --> 02:40:59.225
MARISHA: Where does it look like the most
convenient entrance? With ice and stuff?

02:40:59.225 --> 02:41:05.756
MATT: Maybe four feet away from where the
ice begins. You can see there is one broken

02:41:05.756 --> 02:41:11.546
portion of the ship deck, maybe about a three-foot,
four-foot hole that you could melt towards if

02:41:11.546 --> 02:41:12.445
you wanted to.

02:41:12.445 --> 02:41:15.069
MARISHA: All right, I'm going to concentrate my
Flaming Sphere on that and start melting it.

02:41:15.101 --> 02:41:21.568
MATT: Okay. It's taking a while. About how long
does the spell last, the Flaming Sphere?

02:41:21.568 --> 02:41:23.313
MARISHA: About a minute, I think?

02:41:23.313 --> 02:41:31.418
LAURA: (hums the Jeopardy theme)

02:41:31.418 --> 02:41:38.985
MATT: All right, Flaming Sphere, up to a minute,
yeah. The spell expires, the minute done, and you've

02:41:38.985 --> 02:41:43.060
managed to melt maybe three inches into the ice?

02:41:43.060 --> 02:41:44.441
LAURA: Grog, go punch it.

02:41:44.473 --> 02:41:45.754
MARISHA: How much was it?

02:41:45.754 --> 02:41:47.090
MATT: About four feet of ice.

02:41:47.090 --> 02:41:48.273
MARISHA: Oh, fuck that.

02:41:48.273 --> 02:41:52.615
TRAVIS: Ugh! I got it.

02:41:52.615 --> 02:41:54.011
MARISHA: I step back.

02:41:54.011 --> 02:41:56.775
TRAVIS: And I start going Rocky-ribcage on this
big piece of meat.

02:41:56.775 --> 02:41:59.103
MATT: Okay, make your strength check.

02:41:59.103 --> 02:42:01.815
LAURA: Natural 20.

02:42:01.815 --> 02:42:04.546
TRAVIS: 21.

02:42:04.546 --> 02:42:15.126
MATT: 21. He continues to punch, and punch, and
punch, and each one you see the ice crack, pieces

02:42:15.126 --> 02:42:22.217
of it break away. You get quite a ways to punching
through towards the direction that you are

02:42:22.217 --> 02:42:27.828
currently melting before a lot of the ice crumbles
and falls and almost buries you for a second. But

02:42:27.828 --> 02:42:34.559
you knock it away and pull yourself out of it as
you do, scooping the shards that occupied the

02:42:34.559 --> 02:42:36.352
space where you were and get out of the way.

02:42:36.352 --> 02:42:40.376
MARISHA: I cast a Gust cantrip over top of
him to keep ice from falling on him.

02:42:40.376 --> 02:42:42.882
LAURA: I hope there's really something in here.

02:42:42.931 --> 02:42:43.839
MARISHA: Me too.

02:42:43.839 --> 02:42:52.134
MATT: Keeps punching. You get to one point, and
you hit, and you hear a (dull impact). You watch a

02:42:52.134 --> 02:42:57.287
crack spider up to the top of the throne.

02:42:57.287 --> 02:43:03.577
TRAVIS: I think we need to go.

02:43:03.577 --> 02:43:08.966
MATT: Portion of the throne above you is now
starting to crack and fall onto the side.

02:43:08.966 --> 02:43:11.137
TRAVIS: I start running out of there.

02:43:11.137 --> 02:43:13.196
LAURA: We should get out. Let's go.

02:43:13.246 --> 02:43:14.853
MARISHA: I also back out.

02:43:14.853 --> 02:43:19.402
MATT: Okay. I need the three of you who are
closest to it to make a dexterity saving throw, please.

02:43:19.478 --> 02:43:24.748
TRAVIS: Can I use my Boots of Feral Leaping?

02:43:24.748 --> 02:43:32.865
MATT: You have advantage on dexterity, though.
You'll be fine.

02:43:32.865 --> 02:43:37.838
LIAM: I could've hanged back, but I've been meaning to say 
this whole time that I was creeping around the thrones,

02:43:37.838 --> 02:43:40.100
I'm just going to throw that out, that I'm up there.

02:43:40.145 --> 02:43:46.724
MATT: Okay, so you see this happening. A portion
of it, like a whole half side of it has cracked

02:43:46.724 --> 02:43:52.717
and is sliding down into the cavern that has been
excavated by your party and the Ravenites.

02:43:52.717 --> 02:43:56.949
LIAM: So if I'm almost on it, should I be making a
dex save as well?

02:43:57.005 --> 02:43:59.019
MATT: If you're almost on it--

02:43:59.019 --> 02:44:00.953
LIAM: I was going to poke around and look around
it.

02:44:00.953 --> 02:44:05.701
MATT: Only half of it's collapsing, I'll say
sure. Go for it. You who offers me to let you make

02:44:05.701 --> 02:44:08.212
a dexterity saving throw, yes. I will take it.

02:44:08.212 --> 02:44:10.210
LAURA: Really? Did you really do that?

02:44:10.210 --> 02:44:14.314
LIAM: I rolled a one, but I have lots of Luck
left. And now I'm fine.

02:44:14.357 --> 02:44:16.317
TRAVIS: I'm not.

02:44:16.317 --> 02:44:17.608
LIAM: So that's a 26.

02:44:17.608 --> 02:44:23.101
MATT: So yeah. You manage to leap off and
tumble in the snow to the bottom and don't have

02:44:23.147 --> 02:44:24.675
to worry about it. Travis?

02:44:24.675 --> 02:44:26.145
TRAVIS: Eight. With advantage.

02:44:26.145 --> 02:44:27.163
LAURA: 29.

02:44:27.163 --> 02:44:28.290
MARISHA: Eight.

02:44:28.290 --> 02:44:34.920
TALIESIN: 19. But I burned a Resolve.

02:44:34.920 --> 02:44:40.888
MATT: So as you guys dart out, Grog and Keyleth
unfortunately are left a little bit behind. You

02:44:40.888 --> 02:44:53.972
both are pummelled with chunks of hard ice and
jagged points of broken frost there, dealing 13

02:44:53.972 --> 02:45:01.075
points of bludgeoning and piercing damage to both
of you. And you find yourselves partially buried

02:45:01.075 --> 02:45:06.930
in the ice that cracks off it. You see most of
Keyleth's body is currently buried, just her head

02:45:06.930 --> 02:45:12.252
and arms are out. And Grog, you're about up to
your waist now in broken ice and snow. And you're

02:45:12.252 --> 02:45:15.588
like, (grunts), and pull yourself out.

02:45:15.588 --> 02:45:17.174
TRAVIS: Look at Keyleth's arm.

02:45:17.174 --> 02:45:18.833
LAURA: Yeah, I see it. Can you get her out?

02:45:18.833 --> 02:45:21.227
TRAVIS: Okay. I start moving the ice and pull her
out.

02:45:21.227 --> 02:45:23.642
MATT: You pull Keyleth out.

02:45:23.642 --> 02:45:25.281
MARISHA: (coughing)

02:45:25.281 --> 02:45:26.866
TRAVIS: That didn't go well.

02:45:26.866 --> 02:45:32.731
TALIESIN: Let's burrow straight into the side, I
think, to be on the safe side. Let's stop melting ice.

02:45:32.731 --> 02:45:35.871
LAURA: Isn't it buried completely at this point?

02:45:35.871 --> 02:45:41.116
MATT: At this point, the entire excavation
portion-- by the way, as you guys came back, most

02:45:41.116 --> 02:45:46.110
of the gold and platinum that was in there has
been completely removed by the Ravenites over

02:45:46.110 --> 02:45:51.343
time. And this whole area that has been excavated
so carefully left it in a precarious place. Those

02:45:51.343 --> 02:46:00.333
physical hits by Grog sent that whole south side
of the throne to collapse inwards. So it's

02:46:00.333 --> 02:46:06.705
partially collapsed. There's a large pile of ice,
rock and snow. And it's not very accessible from

02:46:06.705 --> 02:46:08.204
the current standpoint.

02:46:08.204 --> 02:46:13.796
LAURA: Maybe it was one of Vorugal's first
kills or something? And it's sentimental?

02:46:13.845 --> 02:46:16.134
TALIESIN: I don't know, I'm irritated by it.

02:46:16.134 --> 02:46:19.829
LIAM: I think it might have given him a little bit
of juice when he was at home.

02:46:19.829 --> 02:46:23.389
MARISHA: Do you think it has some sort of
icy-like--

02:46:23.389 --> 02:46:27.289
LIAM: Extra ability when he was here, maybe.

02:46:27.289 --> 02:46:30.408
MARISHA: I could try, and maybe now that the ice
is broken I can melt it through it easier?

02:46:30.442 --> 02:46:32.666
LIAM: Why would a dragon keep a boat?

02:46:32.666 --> 02:46:34.122
TALIESIN: Why would he?

02:46:34.122 --> 02:46:37.141
TRAVIS: Maybe his woobie, you know--?

02:46:37.141 --> 02:46:38.679
LAURA: Like a blankie.

02:46:38.679 --> 02:46:41.290
LIAM: Yeah. You know about that, Percy?

02:46:41.290 --> 02:46:45.156
MARISHA: Some people like collecting ships, you
know? Maybe he's a nautical kind of guy.

02:46:45.156 --> 02:46:46.555
TRAVIS: Yeah, guns and ships.

02:46:46.555 --> 02:46:48.296
LAURA: He was a nautical kind of guy.

02:46:48.296 --> 02:46:49.470
MARISHA: Right, yeah.

02:46:49.470 --> 02:46:53.481
TRAVIS: (hums the intro of "Alexander Hamilton")

02:46:53.481 --> 02:46:59.083
LIAM: While we're all standing here with our
thumbs in our butts, could I look around and see

02:46:59.083 --> 02:47:02.919
if I see a little stone, a little palantir?

02:47:02.919 --> 02:47:04.438
MATT: Make a investigation check.

02:47:04.438 --> 02:47:06.489
SAM: Where are you standing?

02:47:06.489 --> 02:47:09.443
LIAM: Ugh, Luck again. Jeepers creepers.

02:47:09.443 --> 02:47:10.659
LAURA: He's up top.

02:47:10.659 --> 02:47:13.926
SAM: If he's up top, I would have been up there
with him, too.

02:47:13.926 --> 02:47:15.087
LIAM: 26.

02:47:15.087 --> 02:47:18.572
SAM: I'm a crow. Circling around, watching him
from above.

02:47:18.572 --> 02:47:19.686
LIAM: I'm invisible.

02:47:19.686 --> 02:47:22.086
SAM: Well, I'm watching the area.

02:47:22.086 --> 02:47:29.363
MATT: All right. What did you roll? 26? Yeah. You
see within the north side of the throne, there are

02:47:29.363 --> 02:47:35.867
two orbs embedded in the ice, about a foot beneath
the surface. Previously you saw more.

02:47:35.867 --> 02:47:41.363
LIAM: In the past, in other locations, you mean?

02:47:41.363 --> 02:47:52.444
MATT: No, meaning when you guys first came to this
when he wasn't there, you saw three stones. You now see two.

02:47:52.487 --> 02:47:57.384
But half of the throne has collapsed as well.

02:47:57.384 --> 02:48:03.919
LIAM: And how far down are they under the ice?

02:48:03.919 --> 02:48:06.778
MATT: About a foot, a foot and a half from the
surface.

02:48:06.778 --> 02:48:09.884
MARISHA: Never mind.

02:48:09.884 --> 02:48:13.284
LIAM: I'm going to go find my sister.

02:48:13.284 --> 02:48:16.709
LAURA: (groans) It's--

02:48:16.709 --> 02:48:19.289
LIAM: Hey! I'm invisible! Here I am.

02:48:19.289 --> 02:48:20.914
LAURA and LIAM: Hi.

02:48:20.914 --> 02:48:22.151
LAURA: Did you see it? It collapsed.

02:48:22.151 --> 02:48:24.364
LIAM: Yes, I saw it. I dodged out of the way.

02:48:24.364 --> 02:48:25.265
LAURA: Good.

02:48:25.265 --> 02:48:27.034
LIAM: I'm right here.

02:48:27.034 --> 02:48:28.314
LAURA: I know! I'm looking at you.

02:48:28.314 --> 02:48:29.753
LIAM: Yes, but I'm invisible.

02:48:29.753 --> 02:48:31.365
LAURA: I'm looking in your direction.

02:48:31.365 --> 02:48:32.823
LIAM: Boop!

02:48:32.823 --> 02:48:34.082
LAURA: Ugh, goddamn it.

02:48:34.082 --> 02:48:38.153
LIAM: Remember those little round seeing stones?

02:48:38.153 --> 02:48:39.250
LAURA: Yeah.

02:48:39.250 --> 02:48:42.480
LIAM: There's a couple under the ice over there. Now,
I was invisible so I don't--

02:48:42.480 --> 02:48:43.803
LAURA: You saw them under the ice?

02:48:43.803 --> 02:48:44.725
LIAM: Yeah.

02:48:44.725 --> 02:48:45.943
LAURA: You saw a couple under the ice?

02:48:45.943 --> 02:48:47.391
LIAM: A couple under the ice, a foot or two away.

02:48:47.391 --> 02:48:50.521
LAURA: Where were the other ones?

02:48:50.521 --> 02:48:52.159
LIAM: I didn't see any other ones.

02:48:52.159 --> 02:48:55.044
LAURA: Were they there before it collapsed?

02:48:55.044 --> 02:49:00.465
LIAM: I don't know. I was standing right beneath
the throne when the throne collapsed. Then I found them.

02:49:00.465 --> 02:49:05.551
LAURA and LIAM: Were they near the area that it
collapsed?

02:49:05.551 --> 02:49:07.953
MATT and LIAM: One of them was, yeah.

02:49:07.953 --> 02:49:11.905
LAURA, MARISHA, TALIESIN, and TRAVIS: Fuck!

02:49:11.905 --> 02:49:13.065
LIAM: Fucking--

02:49:13.065 --> 02:49:14.086
SAM: (caws)

02:49:14.086 --> 02:49:26.407
MARISHA: Hold on, did we maybe get-- is Thordak
going to-- we should go.

02:49:26.520 --> 02:49:28.511
LAURA: Fuck!

02:49:28.511 --> 02:49:32.190
MARISHA: Percy, want to leave a mark anymore?

02:49:32.190 --> 02:49:33.922
LAURA: We should tell Tooma that--

02:49:33.922 --> 02:49:35.223
TALIESIN: We left one.

02:49:35.223 --> 02:49:37.027
LAURA: I go find Tooma.

02:49:37.027 --> 02:49:46.215
MATT: The handful of dragonborn that were there,
after the collapse, were walking back to the

02:49:46.215 --> 02:49:53.964
internal cavern area. As you head back, a large
portion of Ravenites have all come out of their

02:49:53.964 --> 02:50:02.595
caves, and right now are in the process of
scouring the ruins. Some of them are putting

02:50:02.595 --> 02:50:06.753
armaments away. Tooma is out there, currently
conversing with a number of the other community

02:50:06.753 --> 02:50:08.989
leaders that are deciding what the next steps
are.

02:50:08.989 --> 02:50:18.361
MARISHA: I approach Tooma. (clears throat) Tooma,
it's time that we make our departure very soon.

02:50:18.361 --> 02:50:20.005
MATT: "Very well."

02:50:20.005 --> 02:50:24.050
MARISHA: I want to thank you so much for
everything that you provided and everything that

02:50:24.050 --> 02:50:25.390
your people have done.

02:50:25.390 --> 02:50:31.741
MATT: "I wish to thank you for your sticking to
your word."

02:50:31.741 --> 02:50:40.893
MARISHA: Of course. I would love to help and leave
some parting gift in any way that I can.

02:50:40.893 --> 02:50:50.666
MATT: "The riches from the hoard will provide
enough for us. You need not worry."

02:50:50.666 --> 02:50:56.362
MARISHA: What was your land like before Vorugal
got here? I know it wasn't as icy and as frigid.

02:50:56.362 --> 02:51:07.913
MATT: "It was without snow. We are at the
south side of Wildemount. I hope this fades with

02:51:07.957 --> 02:51:10.475
"time, we are not bound for snow people."

02:51:10.475 --> 02:51:18.583
MARISHA: I can attempt to maybe revitalize your
plant life as much as I can before I leave.

02:51:18.583 --> 02:51:20.586
MATT: "You can do this?"

02:51:20.586 --> 02:51:22.151
MARISHA: I can.

02:51:22.151 --> 02:51:27.216
MATT: "By all means. We would appreciate it."

02:51:27.216 --> 02:51:36.276
MARISHA: You have a good, strong people and I
want to see your recovery. Just like I hope the

02:51:36.276 --> 02:51:37.729
same with mine.

02:51:37.729 --> 02:51:39.850
MATT: "Me too."

02:51:39.850 --> 02:51:42.091
MARISHA: Anything that I can do.

02:51:42.091 --> 02:51:43.167
LAURA: Tooma?

02:51:43.167 --> 02:51:44.752
MATT: "Yes?"

02:51:44.752 --> 02:51:47.790
LAURA: You know the stones we talked about?

02:51:47.790 --> 02:51:50.657
MATT: "Yes."

02:51:50.657 --> 02:51:52.282
LAURA: Yeah, they got jostled.

02:51:52.282 --> 02:51:54.312
MATT: "Why?"

02:51:54.312 --> 02:51:59.308
LAURA: It looks like that ice wasn't super-strong,
and it collapsed.

02:51:59.308 --> 02:52:03.124
TALIESIN: The ice was going to collapse
eventually, anyway.

02:52:03.124 --> 02:52:04.883
MATT: "What does this mean?"

02:52:04.883 --> 02:52:06.900
LAURA: Not sure exactly.

02:52:06.900 --> 02:52:08.356
MATT: "Okay."

02:52:08.356 --> 02:52:18.372
LAURA: But you should keep an eye on the sky. If you
see something red, maybe hide. Just for a while.

02:52:18.372 --> 02:52:25.026
Thordak doesn't know what was here. But if he
realizes Vorugal's been killed, he'll come

02:52:25.026 --> 02:52:26.617
looking. Potentially.

02:52:26.617 --> 02:52:28.855
MATT: "But you're going to kill this Thordak,
yes?"

02:52:28.855 --> 02:52:34.871
LAURA: Oh, yeah! With your help, I think. Just in
case he comes before we get to him.

02:52:34.871 --> 02:52:37.120
MATT: "You should get to him quickly, then."

02:52:37.120 --> 02:52:38.970
LAURA: Good plan.

02:52:38.970 --> 02:52:39.828
MATT: "Good."

02:52:39.828 --> 02:52:42.813
LIAM: The whole time she's been talking, her braid
has been going like a magical jump rope because I'm

02:52:42.813 --> 02:52:45.111
standing here doing this with it.

02:52:45.157 --> 02:52:46.850
LAURA: Not. The time.

02:52:46.850 --> 02:52:49.546
TALIESIN: If you find something--

02:52:49.546 --> 02:52:52.181
LAURA: (whispers) Fucking dick! Stop it!

02:52:52.181 --> 02:53:03.517
TALIESIN: If you find an ice weapon in that ship
beneath the throne-- anything magical, some sort

02:53:03.517 --> 02:53:09.075
of ice power, we may need it. That may be useful.

02:53:09.075 --> 02:53:11.693
MATT: "Keep in mind for it."

02:53:11.693 --> 02:53:22.789
MARISHA: I go up to the group. Percy, Vax, I need
to take time with this, so are you all all right

02:53:22.789 --> 02:53:25.683
spending the rest of the day here while I help
them?

02:53:25.683 --> 02:53:27.160
LAURA: Of course.

02:53:27.160 --> 02:53:28.331
TALIESIN: Yeah.

02:53:28.331 --> 02:53:36.747
MARISHA: All right. I ascend to the top of the
ravine and I start meditating, and I cast Plant Growth.

02:53:36.747 --> 02:53:40.348
LAURA: We all need to go up there anyway because
that's where the trees are that we're going to

02:53:40.348 --> 02:53:41.924
transport through, right?

02:53:41.924 --> 02:53:42.896
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:53:42.896 --> 02:53:44.120
LAURA: We make our way to the top of the ravine
as well.

02:53:44.155 --> 02:53:45.491
MATT: What level is Plant Growth?

02:53:45.491 --> 02:53:46.468
MARISHA: Third.

02:53:46.468 --> 02:53:47.419
MATT: 3rd-level. Gotcha.

02:53:47.419 --> 02:53:49.219
MARISHA: And I'm doing the eight-hour--

02:53:49.219 --> 02:53:50.289
LAURA: Eight hours!

02:53:50.289 --> 02:53:51.680
MATT: Boy, guys!

02:53:51.680 --> 02:53:53.556
SAM: Super boring day for us.

02:53:53.607 --> 02:53:55.123
MARISHA: Yep. Sorry.

02:53:55.123 --> 02:53:58.167
TALIESIN: God, I want to get in that ship!

02:53:58.167 --> 02:54:08.325
MARISHA: I start doing that and revitalizing their
landscape as close to what it was before, giving

02:54:08.325 --> 02:54:11.335
their-- [no audio]

02:54:11.335 --> 02:54:16.800
MATT: It affects all normal plants within a
hundred-foot radius. So you have a very specific

02:54:16.800 --> 02:54:18.937
portion that you revitalize in the ravine.

02:54:18.937 --> 02:54:22.286
MARISHA: Okay. Well, I talked to Tooma and find
out where she--

02:54:22.286 --> 02:54:24.630
MATT: Actually, no, all plants in a
half-mile radius are--

02:54:24.630 --> 02:54:28.605
MARISHA: That's what I thought, yeah. In the eight
hour one that's like, crazy.

02:54:28.605 --> 02:54:34.764
MATT: I should have kept reading. Okay, so yeah.
You talk to her about it, and she tells you,

02:54:34.764 --> 02:54:43.062
"The ravine itself does not have the nutrients to
support crops, but we had farmland right

02:54:43.062 --> 02:54:44.459
"above the ravine."

02:54:44.459 --> 02:54:47.845
MARISHA: All right. Do you plan to still reside
there?

02:54:47.845 --> 02:54:49.348
MATT: "Once the snow melts, yes."

02:54:49.348 --> 02:54:51.347
MARISHA: I'll do what I can. And I go there.

02:54:51.347 --> 02:54:56.655
MATT: Okay. You get there, and through the use of
your elemental magics, you easily cast aside the

02:54:56.655 --> 02:55:01.959
snow. And from underneath, you can see where once
there was a heavy amount of cropland that has all

02:55:01.959 --> 02:55:07.211
died off because of the recent freeze that came
with Vorugal. You take the eight hours to

02:55:07.211 --> 02:55:11.423
concentrate and as you, do you enrich the land. You
can watch as many of these dead seeds come to life

02:55:11.423 --> 02:55:19.930
with green once more. Suddenly, you see sprouting
bits of delicious cabbages and other forms of

02:55:19.930 --> 02:55:26.240
produce begin to spring to life and grow nutrient
rich. As this happens, you can see a few of the

02:55:26.274 --> 02:55:31.768
Ravenites who followed you to watch this are taken
aback and excitedly rush down to tell the rest of

02:55:31.768 --> 02:55:35.034
the people. The rest of you are bored out of your
mind for the next eight hours.

02:55:35.034 --> 02:55:37.746
TRAVIS: Kima and I are sparring.

02:55:37.746 --> 02:55:42.659
SAM: Challenge Vax to a peeing in the snow
contest.

02:55:42.659 --> 02:55:44.981
MATT: He's had a lot of wine.

02:55:44.981 --> 02:55:49.006
LIAM: Oh yeah, that was last night.

02:55:49.006 --> 02:55:51.062
LAURA: So you're pretty hungover, you don't have a
lot.

02:55:51.062 --> 02:55:52.299
SAM: Distance and accuracy.

02:55:52.299 --> 02:55:54.996
LIAM: (sings a fanfare) I've brought one
from your house.

02:55:54.996 --> 02:55:56.337
SAM: It's gone.

02:55:56.337 --> 02:55:57.648
LAURA: It disappeared.

02:55:57.648 --> 02:55:58.934
LIAM: Damn it!

02:55:58.934 --> 02:56:00.630
MATT: Yes, as you reach for it, there's nothing
there.

02:56:00.630 --> 02:56:07.406
LAURA: That's amazing.

02:56:07.406 --> 02:56:11.637
MATT: So you guys have fun sparring for a while,
you beat the crap out of each other off and on for

02:56:11.683 --> 02:56:17.355
a few hours and you both feel good about it. When
the eight hours have finished, you guys reconvene.

02:56:17.355 --> 02:56:21.498
LIAM: V-A-X. Your turn.

02:56:21.498 --> 02:56:24.297
MARISHA: Vax is shorter than Scanlan.

02:56:24.297 --> 02:56:25.922
TRAVIS: Cursive, baby.

02:56:25.922 --> 02:56:30.314
MATT: I want both of you guys to make performance
checks

02:56:30.314 --> 02:56:32.634
SAM: Okay.

02:56:32.679 --> 02:56:34.290
Performance for peeing in the snow.

02:56:34.290 --> 02:56:37.655
LAURA: Oh, what what. He's got a really high
modifier, though.

02:56:37.655 --> 02:56:39.054
LIAM: Oh, I'm sure he'll win.

02:56:39.054 --> 02:56:40.621
TALIESIN: No, you're going to win.

02:56:40.621 --> 02:56:41.989
SAM: Not good.

02:56:41.989 --> 02:56:44.253
LIAM: No, even at his lowest it'll be higher I
bet.

02:56:44.253 --> 02:56:44.898
SAM: 18.

02:56:44.898 --> 02:56:45.874
LIAM: 21.

02:56:45.874 --> 02:56:47.170
MATT: You want to add your d12?

02:56:47.170 --> 02:56:48.104
LIAM: Zorro.

02:56:48.104 --> 02:56:50.801
MATT: You can add your own bardic inspiration.

02:56:50.801 --> 02:56:52.240
LIAM: Yeah, if he thinks of it.

02:56:52.240 --> 02:56:53.608
SAM: It's a fair fight.

02:56:53.608 --> 02:56:54.643
MATT: Okay, okay.

02:56:54.643 --> 02:56:55.727
SAM: This is a fair fight.

02:56:55.727 --> 02:57:02.720
MATT: It is close, but as much as your cursive
writing was on point, it was impressive that Vax

02:57:02.720 --> 02:57:08.313
was capable of cursive drawing the X, stopping and
then crossing the X.

02:57:08.313 --> 02:57:09.955
SAM: Whoa.

02:57:09.955 --> 02:57:12.676
TRAVIS: It stings when you stop.

02:57:12.676 --> 02:57:17.795
SAM: That's impressive, but you know my wang is
built for power, not accuracy.

02:57:17.795 --> 02:57:25.459
LAURA: As soon as the cube comes out: can I talk
to you, do you mind stepping away?

02:57:25.459 --> 02:57:27.022
TRAVIS: With the cube out?

02:57:27.022 --> 02:57:28.318
SAM: You talking to me?

02:57:28.318 --> 02:57:29.390
LAURA: No, not you.

02:57:29.390 --> 02:57:35.614
TALIESIN: Sure, yeah, I'm going to do nothing but
stare at that bloody ship if I don't, so sure.

02:57:35.614 --> 02:57:40.453
LAURA: How are you, after dying?

02:57:40.453 --> 02:57:54.846
TALIESIN: I'm trying really hard not to think
about it, actually. I don't know, honestly. There

02:57:54.846 --> 02:57:57.482
hasn't been a lot of time to process.

02:57:57.482 --> 02:58:00.814
LAURA: No, there hasn't. It's a lot in a few days.

02:58:00.814 --> 02:58:07.514
TALIESIN: I would say it would be nice to be going
home, except I know what we're going home to. So

02:58:07.514 --> 02:58:09.085
there's going to be no relief.

02:58:09.085 --> 02:58:11.910
LAURA: No, not for a while, I don't think.

02:58:11.910 --> 02:58:15.442
TALIESIN: That creature hanging around.

02:58:15.442 --> 02:58:17.403
LAURA: Yes.

02:58:17.403 --> 02:58:21.046
TALIESIN: Yeah, death was not pleasant.

02:58:21.046 --> 02:58:30.181
LAURA: No. I have to tell you something

02:58:30.181 --> 02:58:34.721
TALIESIN: All right.

02:58:34.721 --> 02:58:41.618
LAURA: Do you know what Fenthras means?

02:58:41.618 --> 02:58:44.211
TALIESIN: I don't, actually.

02:58:44.211 --> 02:58:49.990
LAURA: It comes from the Elvish words, I'm
surprised. Growth and protection.

02:58:49.990 --> 02:58:57.351
TALIESIN: I would've eventually looked it up. It's
the sort of terribly boring thing I would do.

02:58:57.351 --> 02:59:04.754
LAURA: It's odd that Saundor had it for so long,
since he was quite the opposite of that, don't you think?

02:59:04.754 --> 02:59:10.997
TALIESIN: I tend to think that many people tend to
exalt the exact opposite of what they are.

02:59:10.997 --> 02:59:24.456
LAURA: Yes. I don't know, I think he focused for
so long on the betrayal of his love, on all of the

02:59:24.456 --> 02:59:35.461
horrible things within himself that caused that,
that he became the physical embodiment of it. And

02:59:35.461 --> 02:59:46.471
I think he was trying to do the same thing to me. Even
though I refused him, I could feel those seeds

02:59:46.471 --> 03:00:00.946
being planted. Self-doubt and loathing echoing in
my mind every night. Reliving every wrong that

03:00:00.946 --> 03:00:04.013
people have done to me and everything I have done.

03:00:04.013 --> 03:00:14.805
TALIESIN: I recently-- I will say, before death-- had a 
bit of an epiphany, and have been trying--

03:00:14.805 --> 03:00:20.209
not always succeeding, but trying-- not to 
dwell on such things.

03:00:20.209 --> 03:00:25.506
LAURA: That's actually what I wanted to talk to
you about. In the fight with Ripley.

03:00:25.506 --> 03:00:26.763
TALIESIN: Yes.

03:00:26.763 --> 03:00:31.273
LAURA: Your last words to her were, "I forgive
you."

03:00:31.273 --> 03:00:33.480
TALIESIN: Yes.

03:00:33.480 --> 03:00:36.042
LAURA: It was such a surprise.

03:00:36.042 --> 03:00:37.649
TALIESIN: Yes.

03:00:37.649 --> 03:00:43.746
LAURA: I pull out Fenthras and I show him what
I've carved onto it, it's "sinaeth." Do you know

03:00:43.746 --> 03:00:44.946
that word?

03:00:44.946 --> 03:00:46.416
TALIESIN: How common is that word?

03:00:46.416 --> 03:00:48.058
MATT: You know the word.

03:00:48.058 --> 03:00:49.144
TALIESIN: I would know the word.

03:00:49.144 --> 03:00:50.391
LAURA: It's forgive.

03:00:50.391 --> 03:00:51.663
TALIESIN: Oh.

03:00:51.663 --> 03:01:01.727
LAURA: I carved this on Fenthras because that's
the key, isn't it? It's the only way to really grow.

03:01:01.727 --> 03:01:15.605
TALIESIN: I think so. I'm trying. It's the only
thing I've tried that's made any sense so far. And

03:01:15.605 --> 03:01:31.209
it felt very liberating, it felt good, it felt
perfect. And it wasn't about her. It was just

03:01:31.209 --> 03:01:38.025
about me. Honestly, that was really the thing that
I noticed, was I didn't say it to make her feel

03:01:38.025 --> 03:01:47.158
better, I didn't say it to give her any peace. I
came to that feeling before running into her. I

03:01:47.158 --> 03:02:00.504
didn't know if it would be true when I saw her,
but I feel like so much of my energy had been such

03:02:00.504 --> 03:02:08.768
a waste. And worse than a waste, it had been
twisted in the wrong direction. And it's too late

03:02:08.768 --> 03:02:12.841
for a lot of things. There are things I cannot
take back and things that I have done that will

03:02:12.841 --> 03:02:18.207
forever be terrible, but that's not the point, I
suppose.

03:02:18.207 --> 03:02:25.030
LAURA: It isn't. Whoever that boy was that created
those things, that suffered such horrors that he

03:02:25.030 --> 03:02:35.799
felt they were justified? You have to forgive him,
too. Because everything you've suffered and

03:02:35.799 --> 03:02:42.645
endured and created in that time has made you into
the person you are now. And you have a brilliant

03:02:42.645 --> 03:02:54.319
mind. And any darkness that might cloud your
vision on occasion, the fact that you found it

03:02:54.319 --> 03:02:58.939
within yourself to forgive her means that it will
never overtake you.

03:02:58.939 --> 03:03:11.467
TALIESIN: Thank you. I would like to think we're
all better than we think we are. Except maybe

03:03:11.467 --> 03:03:13.169
your brother. I think he's just a mess.

03:03:13.169 --> 03:03:15.056
LAURA: He's terrible, isn't he? Just the worst.

03:03:15.056 --> 03:03:16.482
TALIESIN: Is he in here?

03:03:16.482 --> 03:03:19.290
LAURA: Maybe, he's probably hiding somewhere.

03:03:19.290 --> 03:03:28.880
TALIESIN: Shouldn't have given him that ring.
Thank you. I know I have to forgive myself. I'm

03:03:28.880 --> 03:03:43.619
not quite there yet, but I can see a path. I like
where we are and what we're doing. I think that

03:03:43.619 --> 03:03:47.775
we're the right people in the right place and the
right time.

03:03:47.775 --> 03:03:59.327
LAURA: I agree. And this engraving is a reminder
that every time I attack, it's not out of

03:03:59.327 --> 03:04:00.882
vengeance.

03:04:00.882 --> 03:04:04.235
TALIESIN: I would be horrified if you were taking
yourself too seriously.

03:04:04.235 --> 03:04:09.514
LAURA: Never. Did you see the bear that I carved
on the tree? It's quite lovely.

03:04:09.514 --> 03:04:14.768
TALIESIN: It was quite lovely. I don't know if the
tree is quite as happy with it, but I was quite

03:04:14.768 --> 03:04:16.066
impressed.

03:04:16.066 --> 03:04:22.355
LAURA: Thank you.

03:04:22.355 --> 03:04:29.674
TALIESIN: Thank you.

03:04:29.717 --> 03:04:35.281
LAURA: That's all.

03:04:35.281 --> 03:04:42.318
TALIESIN: What room are we in, out of curiosity?

03:04:42.318 --> 03:04:44.629
LAURA: There's no room, we're in the woods.

03:04:44.629 --> 03:04:52.917
TALIESIN: Oh, no room, we're in the woods. Yeah,
all right. As I walk away, I walk up.

03:04:52.917 --> 03:04:56.123
I kiss her.

03:04:56.123 --> 03:04:58.517
So we'll talk later. And I walk away.

03:04:58.517 --> 03:05:02.437
LIAM: (singing) Anything can happen in the woods.

03:05:02.437 --> 03:05:05.357
TALIESIN: Bless you.

03:05:05.357 --> 03:05:07.277
TRAVIS: (high-pitched) Oh shit!

03:05:07.277 --> 03:05:09.607
MATT: And it's ten o'clock. We're going to go
ahead and end today's session.

03:05:09.607 --> 03:05:11.608
TALIESIN: Bam, motherfuckers! Bam!

03:05:11.608 --> 03:05:21.221
TRAVIS: (singing) Go on and kiss the girl.

03:05:21.221 --> 03:05:26.139
LAURA: Oh man, oh man.

03:05:26.139 --> 03:05:32.743
MATT: Thank you guys for watching! That episode 
had a lot of interesting moments.

03:05:32.743 --> 03:05:34.841
SAM: We had an elephant fight.

03:05:34.841 --> 03:05:37.382
(laughter)

03:05:37.382 --> 03:05:40.228
MATT: The spoils of war.

03:05:40.228 --> 03:05:42.030
TRAVIS: A whole bunch of new shit.

03:05:42.030 --> 03:05:46.311
LIAM: Look at our signatures in the snow, that's
fucking beautiful!

03:05:46.311 --> 03:05:49.004
TALIESIN: There was pissing, there was kissing,
there was everything!

03:05:49.004 --> 03:05:50.611
SAM: Pissing and kissing.

03:05:50.611 --> 03:05:53.815
TALIESIN: Pissing and Kissing is the title.

03:05:53.815 --> 03:05:55.556
MARISHA: That's a good title.

03:05:55.556 --> 03:05:59.371
MATT: That is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; going to be the title.

03:05:59.371 --> 03:06:02.373
LIAM: I shit it.

03:06:02.373 --> 03:06:03.847
TALIESIN: You're welcome, Internet.

03:06:03.847 --> 03:06:08.814
MATT: Well then. We'll get ourselves to rest for
the evening. You guys do the same, thank you for

03:06:08.814 --> 03:06:13.760
hanging in there. Once again, amazing community,
we love you guys so much, all the support you

03:06:13.760 --> 03:06:18.756
have. Make sure to dig into all the awesome
charities that we support, and you guys support as

03:06:18.756 --> 03:06:24.109
well. We're continuously getting messages from
them, blown away by the generosity of the Critter

03:06:24.109 --> 03:06:29.294
and Team Hooman community, so thank you guys so
much for your support on those.

03:06:29.294 --> 03:06:32.149
LAURA: Thank you, Backblaze.

03:06:32.149 --> 03:06:35.154
ALL: Thanks, Backblaze!

03:06:35.154 --> 03:06:40.654
TRAVIS: That amazing commercial. They're always so
good.

03:06:40.654 --> 03:06:47.707
MATT: I guess until next week, guys. Is it
Thursday yet? See you then.

03:06:47.707 --> 03:06:50.230
TRAVIS: Oh shit, man!
