00:11:30.663 --> 00:11:33.215
MATT: (laughing) Hello everyone, and welcome to
tonight's episode of Critical--

00:11:33.347 --> 00:11:35.666
fuck you, Liam! Fuck you!

00:11:35.666 --> 00:11:41.511
Tonight's episode of Critical Role, where a bunch 
of us nerdy-ass voice actors

00:11:41.511 --> 00:11:43.508
sit around and play Dungeons and Dragons.

00:11:43.508 --> 00:11:46.969
LIAM: Victory!

00:11:46.969 --> 00:11:47.508
LAURA: You did it.

00:11:47.508 --> 00:11:50.879
MATT: Oh, that's gonna come back to haunt you.
Welcome to tonight's episode.

00:11:50.879 --> 00:11:55.675
We have quite an episode tonight. We'll have that
to get to in just a moment.

00:11:55.675 --> 00:11:57.694
First, we'll get through our announcements for the
evening.

00:11:57.694 --> 00:12:01.827
First and foremost, our wonderful sponsor tonight,
returning to sponsor the show, Lootcrate!

00:12:01.827 --> 00:12:03.562
ALL: Lootcrate!

00:12:03.562 --> 00:12:08.530
MATT: To open that up, Sam, who could not be here
tonight unfortunately,

00:12:08.530 --> 00:12:10.745
Sam Riegel is not able to make the episode.

00:12:10.745 --> 00:12:14.571
He did make a video, however, to help get us in
the spirit of Lootcrate's awesomeness.

00:12:14.571 --> 00:12:15.568
LAURA: Oh, wow.

00:12:15.568 --> 00:12:20.059
MATT: If you want to go ahead and show that for
us.

00:12:20.059 --> 00:12:25.323
SAM: Hi everyone, it's me, pro alpine skier Sam
Riegel, a.k.a. Scanlan Shorthalt

00:12:25.323 --> 00:12:30.390
from Critical Role. You know, when I'm not 
rolling dice, I'm rolling the dice on the hot,

00:12:30.390 --> 00:12:32.661
hot slopes of Park City, Utah.

00:12:32.661 --> 00:12:33.995
(worried noise)

00:12:33.995 --> 00:12:38.580
Anyway. I just did a lot of downhill skiing 
today, and it was pretty cool,

00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:44.170
but not as cool as the stuff you can get
inside Lootcrate. Sign up now and you'll save so

00:12:44.170 --> 00:12:51.994
much money, you can come on an exciting vacation
to Park City, Utah, buy skis, and gloves, and go

00:12:51.994 --> 00:12:59.248
skiing. With me! Sam Riegel, a.k.a Scanlan
Shorthalt from TV's-- well. The internet's

00:12:59.248 --> 00:13:07.182
Critical Role! Anyway, I'm about to go do my last
run. Hope I don't break my leg. (worried noise)

00:13:07.182 --> 00:13:13.619
If I do, I won't see you on Thursday, but if 
I don't, let's roll high. Bye-bye.

00:13:13.619 --> 00:13:18.109
MATT: Thank you very much, Sam. We look forward to
having you back next week in one form or another.

00:13:18.109 --> 00:13:20.934
ALL: Ohhh.

00:13:20.934 --> 00:13:22.149
LAURA: Mercer!

00:13:22.149 --> 00:13:23.617
MATT: What? What?

00:13:23.617 --> 00:13:24.607
LAURA: Oh no!

00:13:24.607 --> 00:13:25.776
ASHLEY: That's cold!

00:13:25.776 --> 00:13:26.813
LAURA: Ice-cold.

00:13:26.813 --> 00:13:27.557
TALIESIN: That's not nice.

00:13:27.557 --> 00:13:30.503
MATT: But to finish up the details of our
wonderful Lootcrate sponsorship, we have Ashley

00:13:30.503 --> 00:13:31.823
Johnson joining us thankfully from New York.

00:13:31.823 --> 00:13:33.520
ALL: (cheering)

00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:34.860
MATT: The monster herself.

00:13:34.860 --> 00:13:42.635

ASHLEY: Critical Role!

00:14:18.526 --> 00:14:20.965
ALL: (applauding)

00:14:20.965 --> 00:14:22.013
MATT: Thank you, Ashley.

00:14:22.013 --> 00:14:23.052
LAURA: Good job, Ashley.

00:14:23.052 --> 00:14:24.267
MARISHA: That was so good. That was--

00:14:24.267 --> 00:14:25.638
LIAM: You have to get a plane back to New York
now, right?

00:14:25.638 --> 00:14:28.651
ASHLEY: Okay, bye!

00:14:28.651 --> 00:14:33.076
MATT: All right, so, next up we have merch
announcements. Laura, do you want to go ahead?

00:14:33.076 --> 00:14:39.571
LAURA: Oh gosh, yeah! Okay, you guys. I know we've
been teasing it for a while, but guess what we

00:14:39.571 --> 00:14:42.186
have back in stock?

00:14:42.186 --> 00:14:44.275
MARISHA: Are those the Critical Role dice sets?

00:14:44.275 --> 00:14:45.712
LAURA: Why, they are!

00:14:45.712 --> 00:14:47.412
MARISHA: Oh my goodness!

00:14:47.412 --> 00:14:49.985
LAURA: Don't get too excited right now, 'cause
they're not in the store at this very moment,

00:14:49.985 --> 00:14:55.904
okay? We're putting them up for sale tomorrow at
noon our time, Pacific Standard Time, so that, you

00:14:55.904 --> 00:15:00.366
know, all you lovely folks that don't get to watch
at 7PM on Thursdays can maybe snag 'em tomorrow

00:15:00.366 --> 00:15:05.737
afternoon, too. So, 12PM. Go to the store
tomorrow. That's Friday, and you will get one of

00:15:05.737 --> 00:15:07.156
these cool things.

00:15:07.156 --> 00:15:07.765
MATT: Yay!

00:15:07.765 --> 00:15:09.589
TRAVIS: They've all been anointed with our
individual musks.

00:15:09.589 --> 00:15:11.099
LAURA: That's right. We've licked very bag.

00:15:11.099 --> 00:15:12.061
MARISHA: It's true.

00:15:12.061 --> 00:15:13.590
ASHLEY: Every dice. Every die.

00:15:13.590 --> 00:15:14.503
TRAVIS: Yeah, DNA all over.

00:15:14.503 --> 00:15:15.459
LAURA: I literally just licked it.

00:15:15.459 --> 00:15:16.611
MARISHA: I put a bunch in my bra, walked around
for a day.

00:15:16.611 --> 00:15:17.373
TALIESIN: Swished it right to left. Right to left.

00:15:17.373 --> 00:15:18.482
LAURA: Nice, nice.

00:15:18.482 --> 00:15:19.388
ASHLEY: Armpits.

00:15:19.388 --> 00:15:20.013
LAURA: Armpits. Lots of armpits.

00:15:20.013 --> 00:15:20.731
MARISHA: Boob sweat.

00:15:20.731 --> 00:15:21.827
TALIESIN: Yeah. Wet.

00:15:21.827 --> 00:15:27.032
MATT: So, you get to enjoy that. Thank you, Laura.
Also a reminder, we have Anime Milwaukee coming

00:15:27.032 --> 00:15:31.152
up, February 17th through the 19th. We have me and
Marisha and Laura and Travis will be in attendance

00:15:31.152 --> 00:15:32.266
with some cool folks.

00:15:32.266 --> 00:15:33.236
(all cheer)

00:15:33.236 --> 00:15:35.447
MATT: So come check us out. I think that's it.

00:15:35.447 --> 00:15:35.917
LAURA: Noon.

00:15:35.917 --> 00:15:37.336
MATT: Anyone else have anything they wanna talk
about?

00:15:37.336 --> 00:15:38.416
TRAVIS: Nope.

00:15:38.416 --> 00:15:40.592
TALIESIN: Uh, yeah, no. (laughs)

00:15:40.592 --> 00:15:45.342
MATT: All right, then. Then, let's bring it down
just a little bit--

00:15:45.342 --> 00:15:46.303
LIAM: What do you mean?

00:15:46.303 --> 00:15:48.888
MATT: --as we step into tonight's episode of
Critical Role.

00:15:48.888 --> 00:15:52.580
(nervous sounds)

00:15:52.580 --> 00:17:19.847
(opening credits)

00:17:19.847 --> 00:17:26.011
MATT: And welcome back. So, to get you caught up
on the current events of Critical Role. The party,

00:17:26.011 --> 00:17:32.135
Vox Machina, has been combating the horrible,
terrible influence of the Chroma Conclave, a group

00:17:32.135 --> 00:17:36.643
of chromatic dragons that have been terrorizing
the countryside of Tal'Dorei, occupying the city

00:17:36.643 --> 00:17:42.256
of Emon, Westruun, and places beyond. They've
managed to kill off all the members of the

00:17:42.256 --> 00:17:48.289
Conclave, leading up to Raishan, the orchestrator
behind the scenes of most of the chaos that

00:17:48.289 --> 00:17:54.112
they've seen in recent months. Raishan managed to
nearly destroy Vox Machina before absconding with

00:17:54.112 --> 00:17:59.730
the corpse of Thordak, apparently into the next
portion of her plot. The party, upon running into

00:17:59.730 --> 00:18:06.882
an old friend, Kerrek from Westruun, who had
helped in the attack on Emon, joined forces to

00:18:06.882 --> 00:18:11.897
give chase, in hopes through your decision to head
her off at the pass and prevent Raishan from

00:18:11.897 --> 00:18:18.533
seeing to fruition whatever plan she had after
this leg. Through a series of very well-placed

00:18:18.686 --> 00:18:24.500
scrys, you discovered that she had absconded to
the island of Viscond, an old lair of Thordak's

00:18:24.500 --> 00:18:29.496
and before that, an older lair of Opash, an
ancient necromancer who was banished and made that

00:18:29.566 --> 00:18:36.529
his lair. As you made your way to the island,
hopefully prepared for this, you've fought through

00:18:36.529 --> 00:18:41.901
various traps and difficult challenges throughout
the necromancer's sanctum, eventually coming into

00:18:41.901 --> 00:18:49.820
battle with Raishan herself. A long hard-fought
battle left Percy and Scanlan both lifeless to the

00:18:49.820 --> 00:18:55.835
ground. Percy was risen quickly. Scanlan,
unfortunately, was not. And the final blow

00:18:55.835 --> 00:19:00.860
delivered a combination of both Keyleth tearing
the intellect from Raishan through a well-placed

00:19:00.860 --> 00:19:07.080
Feeblemind spell and Kerrek with a well-placed
warhammer blow to the head of the green dragon.

00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:08.740
MARISHA: High five.

00:19:08.740 --> 00:19:11.489
MATT: (laughs) High five from the screen.

00:19:11.489 --> 00:19:13.011
TRAVIS: You're just hitting him in the face.

00:19:13.011 --> 00:19:14.017
TALISIN: So awkward.

00:19:14.017 --> 00:19:14.821
MARISHA: Deuces.

00:19:14.821 --> 00:19:15.828
MATT: There you go.

00:19:15.828 --> 00:19:17.225
TRAVIS: (laughs) Deuces.

00:19:17.225 --> 00:19:23.899
MATT: The dragon destroyed. However, their friend,
Scanlan, still lifeless and still, growing colder

00:19:23.899 --> 00:19:28.856
as the minutes passed. Picked up his body and you
fled the cavern to the outside of the island after

00:19:28.856 --> 00:19:34.310
discovering the teleportation or, at least, the
magic of transport had some sort of an alteration

00:19:34.310 --> 00:19:43.499
or a funkiness to it, if you will. You watched as
two of your allies, Kima and Allura, were, instead

00:19:43.499 --> 00:19:47.289
of teleporting away through a circle, sent deep
out into the ocean. You managed to find them

00:19:47.289 --> 00:19:49.006
(laughs) through a very lucky perception roll.

00:19:49.006 --> 00:19:50.030
MARISHA: (laughs nervously)

00:19:50.030 --> 00:19:54.805
MATT: And at least was able-- you were able to
connect your Transport via Plants through one of

00:19:54.805 --> 00:20:02.629
the outside trees by the beach to get you all to
Whitestone. There you took Scanlan's body to the

00:20:02.629 --> 00:20:12.367
recently constructed temple to the Raven Queen
and in preparing for this ritual the Gatestone was

00:20:12.447 --> 00:20:20.965
taken by Vex, who with the help of the Realmseer
Eskil Ryndarien, transported to Kymal, made your

00:20:20.965 --> 00:20:27.000
way through the riff-raff to one of the darkened
taverns there, to find Kaylie, Scanlan's daughter,

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:33.713
long-estranged and rambunctious daughter but
daughter nonetheless. Handed her the Gatestone and

00:20:33.713 --> 00:20:41.224
she vanished in a puff of arcane smoke, leaving
you and-- Eskil more confused than you, within the

00:20:41.224 --> 00:20:45.891
tavern. And that... is where we jump back in for
the evening.

00:20:45.891 --> 00:20:47.568
TRAVIS: (gagging noise)

00:20:47.568 --> 00:20:55.064
MATT: So, as you guys are waiting carefully,
figuring out what to do in these moments. Pike, as

00:20:55.064 --> 00:21:01.306
you're cleaning the area, cleaning the body and
doing the best you can to begin preparing for a

00:21:01.306 --> 00:21:08.008
ritual that you are hoping will be in the favor of
you and your friends. Percy, as you hold the other

00:21:08.008 --> 00:21:13.234
end of the Gatestone, you feel it begin to glow
and warm in your hand and you instinctively take a

00:21:13.234 --> 00:21:20.626
step back as within a bright flash (fizzle sound)
you watch as Kaylie, the gnomish, short-haired,

00:21:20.626 --> 00:21:25.622
rambunctious bard stands there now, near the
entranceway to the Raven Queen's temple holding

00:21:25.622 --> 00:21:30.087
the other Gatestone. She's clutching it, her face
still stoic and confused by the sudden

00:21:30.087 --> 00:21:34.199
transference. She takes it and drops it to the
ground.

00:21:34.199 --> 00:21:35.946
TALIESIN: I'll take that.

00:21:35.946 --> 00:21:37.589
MARISHA: She found you.

00:21:37.589 --> 00:21:47.991
MATT: Right. Good to see all of you. 
So... Is it true?

00:21:47.991 --> 00:21:54.315
TALIESIN: Yes (clears throat) He's inside.

00:21:54.377 --> 00:21:58.305
MATT: "Let me see the bastard." 
And she pushes past and muscles through you

00:21:58.305 --> 00:22:03.744
who've just previously begun to walk into the
temple slowly kind of taking in the gravity of the

00:22:03.744 --> 00:22:11.384
situation and whether or not you want to even step
up the plate on this, in that quiet, tense, slow

00:22:11.384 --> 00:22:16.726
but perpetual thought process that is Grog. You
feel a small hand grab the side of your hip and

00:22:16.726 --> 00:22:21.631
shove, though to no effect, you just feel a little
tug as Kaylie pushes past you.

00:22:21.631 --> 00:22:24.363
"Pardon me big man"

00:22:24.363 --> 00:22:29.125
And you watch as she darts up to where Pike is
currently preparing the body for the ritual.

00:22:29.125 --> 00:22:30.897
ASHLEY: (quick sigh)

00:22:30.897 --> 00:22:39.349
MATT: You watch as Kaylie steps up to the edge and
gets up onto the top of the central altar and

00:22:39.349 --> 00:22:53.649
stands over quietly looking down over Scanlan's
cold body. She crosses her arms.

00:22:53.649 --> 00:22:57.148
"He made me a promise."

00:22:57.148 --> 00:22:59.583
ASHLEY: I know

00:22:59.583 --> 00:23:07.687
MATT: "You made me a promise!"

00:23:07.687 --> 00:23:14.914
And she leans forward, kneels down and slaps him
across the face (cracking sound)

00:23:14.914 --> 00:23:17.189
"You made me a promise."

00:23:17.189 --> 00:23:22.268
And she gets up and (sniffle) wipes her nose a bit
and hops off and just storms

00:23:22.268 --> 00:23:24.646
ASHLEY: I run after her.

00:23:24.646 --> 00:23:27.143
MATT: Okay, she just keeps charging, not stopping
not slowing.

00:23:27.143 --> 00:23:29.363
ASHLEY: Wait!

00:23:29.363 --> 00:23:33.315
MATT: You eventually get outside. You guys watch
as Kaylie pushes past, and then Pike shortly

00:23:33.315 --> 00:23:39.067
thereafter. She spins around, looking at you. You
can see her fists are clenched at her sides, face

00:23:39.067 --> 00:23:44.681
still dry but you can see the water just slightly,
barely keeping back in her eyes. She goes,

00:23:44.681 --> 00:23:46.535
"What?"

00:23:46.535 --> 00:23:50.508
ASHLEY: Listen, I know how angry you are--

00:23:50.508 --> 00:23:52.854
MATT: (sarcastically laughs)

00:23:52.854 --> 00:24:00.592
ASHLEY: --but we need you here today. So he can at
least have more of a chance to be the father that

00:24:00.592 --> 00:24:03.521
you've always wanted him to be.

00:24:03.521 --> 00:24:06.399
MATT: "Those days have passed I'm afraid."

00:24:06.399 --> 00:24:09.477
ASHLEY: You have no idea how much he loves you.

00:24:09.477 --> 00:24:17.364
MATT: (laughs) "Oh, he's- he's loved a lot of
girls in his days. That I'm certain."

00:24:17.364 --> 00:24:23.267
ASHLEY: That may be true, but not as much as you

00:24:23.267 --> 00:24:30.613
MATT: (sighs) "Well, get on with
it then. I figure at the very least we can go

00:24:30.613 --> 00:24:38.569
"about our business when this is over. Clear
conscience and all that.

00:24:38.569 --> 00:24:43.038
"How much time do you need?"

00:24:43.038 --> 00:24:45.290
ASHLEY: As long as it takes.

00:24:45.290 --> 00:24:49.112
MATT: "Well, have we time for a drink?"

00:24:49.112 --> 00:24:51.724
ASHLEY: Uh, yes

00:24:51.724 --> 00:24:53.077
MATT: "I'm going to get a drink."

00:24:53.077 --> 00:24:58.013
And she just walks back into Whitestone.

00:24:58.013 --> 00:25:01.602
TRAVIS: Am I still in there?

00:25:01.602 --> 00:25:05.382
MATT: You're still in there, right now by
yourself, as Pike just pushed past you, and you

00:25:05.382 --> 00:25:10.279
have Scanlan alone, on the altar.

00:25:10.279 --> 00:25:23.267
TRAVIS: Can I go over to him? Does he look the
same?

00:25:23.267 --> 00:25:32.947
MATT: He looks the same, just...paler. He's been
cleaned, so, the rest of you are a mess still, but

00:25:32.947 --> 00:25:39.500
he's clean, his hair is pulled back and brushed a
bit by Pike as part of the preparation for the

00:25:39.500 --> 00:25:46.009
ritual, his clothes still tattered and worn from
previous battles but--

00:25:46.009 --> 00:25:55.973
TRAVIS: Can I reach out and put my hand on his
chest? Do I feel anything?

00:25:55.973 --> 00:26:04.120
MATT: Nothing. It's cold to the touch. He's been
gone for a while now and there's very little

00:26:04.120 --> 00:26:14.014
difference between the touch of the stone he's on
and the chest other than the fleshy texture.

00:26:14.014 --> 00:26:26.512
TRAVIS: This is not over. It can't be. (laughs).
We've done so much and we have so much more to do,

00:26:26.512 --> 00:26:40.797
right? This is, this is not over. All right, don't,
don't you move. Go ahead and get your shut eye and

00:26:40.797 --> 00:26:50.613
we'll be back. You rest here. Try not to have too
much fun without us.

00:26:50.664 --> 00:26:52.321
And I leave.

00:26:52.321 --> 00:26:59.126
MATT: Okay. Pike, you go in and finish the
preparations for the ritual. And the ritual itself

00:26:59.126 --> 00:27:05.917
is an hour long once the spell is engaged. You're
just cleansing the temple, some of the leaves that

00:27:05.917 --> 00:27:16.941
have blown in. What's everybody else doing in
the meantime?

00:27:16.941 --> 00:27:19.278
LIAM: I'm just an assistant.

00:27:19.278 --> 00:27:20.385
MARISHA: Same

00:27:20.385 --> 00:27:26.622
TALIESIN: I'm organising, getting any materials
that we need

00:27:26.622 --> 00:27:29.074
MATT: Okay. Kerrek?

00:27:29.074 --> 00:27:39.158
PATRICK: I'm keeping my distance &nbsp;but watching
what it is that they're getting ready to do here.

00:27:39.158 --> 00:27:51.698
I'm half way between disbelief and wanting to see
how somebody else runs their priestly-- this is

00:27:51.698 --> 00:27:59.241
sort of like a professional interest, what is this
guy doing to appease the Raven Queen this way?

00:27:59.241 --> 00:28:09.668
MATT: Alrighty. You finish preparations. Kaylie
hasn't returned at that moment. About ten minutes

00:28:09.668 --> 00:28:18.249
more pass and you hear small footsteps begin to
make their way to the outside of the temple.

00:28:18.249 --> 00:28:31.177
There, stepping through, a little wobbly, but a
stoic, stone faced Kaylie, her hair kind of damp

00:28:31.177 --> 00:28:34.030
and slicked back with her fingers &nbsp;as she comes
through.

00:28:34.030 --> 00:28:40.273
(sniffs) "All right, let's get it over with."

00:28:40.327 --> 00:28:51.576
And you can smell the alcohol. She stumbles up to
the temple&nbsp;and puts her hands on the altar

00:28:51.576 --> 00:28:53.166
"So, do your thing."

00:28:53.166 --> 00:28:58.832
TRAVIS: Hold on. Look at me.

00:28:58.832 --> 00:29:04.227
MATT: She turns around and looks up at you as she
is, practically, just past your thigh.

00:29:04.227 --> 00:29:14.110
TRAVIS: It's so funny. I never realized it before.
You look so much like him.

00:29:14.110 --> 00:29:19.534
MATT: Well be careful, I'm at the right height to
be juggling your-- (laughs half-heartedly)

00:29:19.534 --> 00:29:21.553
TRAVIS: I'd expect no less

00:29:21.553 --> 00:29:27.521
(laughter)

00:29:27.521 --> 00:29:35.043
MATT: She lingers on your eye contact for a
second, gives a nod. &nbsp;She gives you a tap

00:29:35.043 --> 00:29:37.608
and turns back around, and puts her hands
on the altar.

00:29:37.608 --> 00:29:39.639
TRAVIS: (groans) Right.

00:29:39.639 --> 00:29:41.428
(laughter)

00:29:41.428 --> 00:29:52.366
ASHLEY: Okay. I guess we'll go ahead and
get started. (sighs shakily)

00:29:52.366 --> 00:30:02.349
MATT: All right, so as Pike takes her holy symbol
out and begins preparing and burning the incense,

00:30:02.349 --> 00:30:12.197
you, conscious that while you are a follower of
Sarenrae, you are in the space of the Raven Queen,

00:30:12.197 --> 00:30:19.178
take heed to make sure that the symbols you
prepare as part of the ritual are a union of the

00:30:19.178 --> 00:30:24.503
symbols of redemption, which call to your divine
nature, and the cycle of life, that are indicative

00:30:24.503 --> 00:30:31.957
of the Raven Queen's spheres of both fate and
passing. &nbsp;You orchestrate them in a way that is

00:30:31.957 --> 00:30:39.914
synergistic, so that there is a definitive intent
to not let this life-line sever. As you finish the

00:30:39.914 --> 00:30:47.426
completion of these various symbols and glyphs,
spreading the salts across with each line that is

00:30:47.426 --> 00:30:59.252
drawn, you then begin to gather everyone around
the altar itself, closing the doors behind you.

00:30:59.252 --> 00:31:06.433
You pull out the diamond component of this
resurrection ritual. If you want to mark it off

00:31:06.433 --> 00:31:15.496
within your gear, either if you have a diamond
worth 1000 gold or just mark 1000 gold off.

00:31:15.496 --> 00:31:21.812
LAURA: There's a diamond.

00:31:21.812 --> 00:31:28.679
MATT: At which point you take the diamond and
place it over Scanlan's chest, and you begin

00:31:28.679 --> 00:31:35.815
uttering the incantation. What begins as a small
whisper begins to echo, and you hear the source of

00:31:35.815 --> 00:31:42.547
the voice from Pike, but within a minute, it's
almost like the voice is sourceless. It begins to

00:31:42.547 --> 00:31:48.074
fill the room. It seeps from every corner. We hear
Pike from all sides, and the more she begins to

00:31:48.074 --> 00:31:56.770
chant, the more you hear this very faint chorus
begin to join in, a harmonizing voice. A secondary

00:31:56.770 --> 00:32:03.467
harmonizing voice. And you are familiar with this.
This is the initiation of the ritual. This is the

00:32:03.467 --> 00:32:09.494
reaching out to the soul, the bond, the thread
that maintains the connection of the spirit to the

00:32:09.494 --> 00:32:24.096
prime material plane. Now, who would like to make
a contribution to the ritual?

00:32:24.096 --> 00:32:41.113
TRAVIS: I'll go. I step up, and I take my
Titanstone Knuckles off. I take the Belt of

00:32:41.113 --> 00:32:55.096
Dwarvenkind off and I wrap it around the knuckles,
and I lay it next to Scanlan, and I say,

00:32:55.096 --> 00:33:03.450
You've been with me through so much. I pride 
myself on my strength, but as we fought

00:33:03.450 --> 00:33:09.254
Earthbreaker Groon, you were there by my side 
as I learned that my true strength comes from my

00:33:09.254 --> 00:33:21.759
friends, which means that these trinkets, no 
matter how strong they are, mean nothing. You

00:33:21.759 --> 00:33:31.178
knew me before then, and I would hope you would 
know me after. While my best buddy Pike taught

00:33:31.178 --> 00:33:43.762
me to love, you taught me to laugh, and I don't 
want to know what life is like without that. And

00:33:43.762 --> 00:33:51.862
the last thing I'd say is, you spent so many 
times inspiring me, I'd like to take a page from

00:33:51.862 --> 00:33:59.161
your book. And to the tune of the Washington 
Redskins fight song--

00:33:59.161 --> 00:34:00.641
(laughter around the table)

00:34:00.641 --> 00:34:03.243
I sing 
(singing)

00:34:03.243 --> 00:34:10.770
Hail to Scanlan Shorthalt 
Hail to victory!

00:34:10.770 --> 00:34:24.355
No one can make me laugh faster. 
Please bring him back to me.

00:34:24.355 --> 00:34:45.683
MATT: Go ahead and make a persuasion check with
advantage.

00:34:45.683 --> 00:34:47.101
TRAVIS: 14.

00:34:47.101 --> 00:34:58.253
MATT: Okay. As Grog steps away, you watch as a
portion of the circular glyph pattern of the

00:34:58.424 --> 00:35:04.852
ritual around you lights up, the first
contribution being presented.

00:35:04.852 --> 00:35:10.949
Who wishes to take
the next presentation?

00:35:10.949 --> 00:35:13.822
ASHLEY: I have a couple things to say but
I know I'm already--

00:35:13.822 --> 00:35:19.471
MATT: Okay.

00:35:19.471 --> 00:35:31.267
ASHLEY: I reach in my pocket and I
pull out a little doll, and--

00:35:31.267 --> 00:35:42.442
Scanlan, I don't know if you remember this, but 
you gave this to me, and it's a little doll of you

00:35:42.442 --> 00:35:49.583
Which is very appropriate.
But when I died, this saved my life because you

00:35:49.583 --> 00:36:00.038
gave it to me, and I didn't know that you had put
Healing Words in it. It saved me, and I hope that

00:36:00.038 --> 00:36:05.312
today I can return the favor. 
I place that next to him.

00:36:05.312 --> 00:36:20.530
I prepared a poem. I don't have it memorized, so
hold on.

00:36:20.530 --> 00:36:27.731
Here lies Scanlan the bard, 
A gnome who sang soft but died hard.

00:36:27.731 --> 00:36:33.312
To anyone who hears us, both far and wide, 
Bring us back our dirty friend

00:36:33.312 --> 00:36:40.011
At least one more time. 
He may not be tall, or brute, or rough

00:36:40.011 --> 00:36:47.981
He may be little, but his heart is buff. 
We are a party, and every party needs a clown,

00:36:47.981 --> 00:36:52.877
Without our friend to reign us in we'll burn down
your whole fucking town.

00:36:52.877 --> 00:36:55.194
(all laugh)

00:36:55.194 --> 00:37:02.824
You see, I love this gnome very much. 
He's small like me, but he's touched.

00:37:02.824 --> 00:37:07.844
He's raided and slain, 
He's pooped while he sang,

00:37:07.844 --> 00:37:13.596
But if he's gone forever I won't be the same

00:37:13.596 --> 00:37:18.610
Now that he's learned he's a dad, 
The journey that all of us had

00:37:18.610 --> 00:37:21.868
Cannot be in vain 
Will not be in waste.

00:37:21.868 --> 00:37:43.058
Please, Scanlan, open your eyes and see your
daughter's face.

00:37:43.058 --> 00:37:54.289
MATT: I'd say go ahead and make-- make a
performance check with advantage.

00:37:54.289 --> 00:38:04.032
ASHLEY: Okay.

00:38:04.032 --> 00:38:11.202
ASHLEY: Okay, that's good, that's good.

00:38:11.202 --> 00:38:15.613
I just rolled a natural 20.

00:38:15.613 --> 00:38:18.703
(Matt laughs)

00:38:18.703 --> 00:38:24.559
ASHLEY: Oh man. Okay, okay.

00:38:24.559 --> 00:38:33.587
MATT: All right. As you finish the
poem you had wrote and step back, the second of

00:38:33.587 --> 00:38:40.055
the three portions of the circle comes aglow, and
you realize, as she was speaking this poem, the

00:38:40.055 --> 00:38:44.236
chanting that she had begun has just continued
without her, like as the ritual continues the

00:38:44.236 --> 00:38:49.747
chanting seems to have been taken and echoed by
the actual essence of the spell. As she stepped

00:38:49.747 --> 00:38:56.581
out of the incantation it continued on its own; it
continues to swell, stronger and stronger. At this

00:38:56.581 --> 00:39:06.204
point as you step back, there's a flash of
movement at the edge of the altar, and with a

00:39:06.204 --> 00:39:13.228
double clack of her shoes, you watch Kaylie land
her flip onto the top of the altar, stand up

00:39:13.228 --> 00:39:20.671
straight, wobble for a second, and catch her-- she
pulls out her fiddle.

00:39:20.671 --> 00:39:28.357
LIAM: Wait, wait, wait-- I just take her wrist.

00:39:28.357 --> 00:39:32.660
It's no small thing to have a father who loves
you.

00:39:32.660 --> 00:39:40.562
And I cast Lay on Hands and clear her mind of
the alcohol.

00:39:40.562 --> 00:39:45.026
MATT: Her instinct is to pull away as you grasp
her wrist, as it is instinctive for any man who

00:39:45.026 --> 00:39:51.354
tries to lay a hand on her. In a moment she fights
the instinct, and as the healing energy flows

00:39:51.354 --> 00:39:58.737
through her arm she closes her eyes, and for the
first time since she arrived, you watch as the

00:39:58.737 --> 00:40:06.750
tears that she had kept at bay blink down her
cheek, finally. She reaches over and taps your

00:40:06.750 --> 00:40:19.604
hand twice with her bow, and still not making eye
contact with you, just nods, and begins to play a

00:40:19.604 --> 00:40:31.867
beautiful, soft, sad violin piece that begins to
swell faster and faster and faster and transition

00:40:31.867 --> 00:40:40.857
from a mournful piece of remembrance into a
lively, jovial fiddle piece. The music begins to

00:40:40.857 --> 00:40:46.110
pick up, and she begins to dance, her feet
clacking across the top of the altar. The

00:40:46.110 --> 00:40:52.387
juxtaposition of the energy and the emotion of the
room towards this strange rush of energy and

00:40:52.387 --> 00:40:58.260
liveliness is awkward at first, and then welcome,
and you can't help but, in spite of yourselves,

00:40:58.260 --> 00:41:05.211
smile. The sound fills the room as she goes faster
and faster and faster, her feet clacking, faster

00:41:05.211 --> 00:41:10.067
and faster, across the stone work on the top. She
brings it to a giant crescendo, finishes with a

00:41:10.067 --> 00:41:15.423
flourish, the bow (makes a whooshing noise)
outside. She puts her head up, and you see the

00:41:15.423 --> 00:41:24.138
tears streak down her face, no smile, just a stone
expression, and she gives a bow.

00:41:24.138 --> 00:41:34.034
That's a performance check on that. The third, and
final, portion of the ritual begins to swell. As

00:41:34.034 --> 00:41:47.090
the magic crescendos, we take into account the
final roll.

00:41:47.090 --> 00:42:13.343
I'm going to post this right now. And I assure you
guys, this is what got rolled.

00:42:13.343 --> 00:42:23.281
MATT: As the divine energies of the ritual swell,
you watch as the energy shoots across, stepping

00:42:23.281 --> 00:42:30.068
into the diamond that's still on his chest. You
watch as the divine powers--

00:42:30.068 --> 00:42:34.569
The diamond swells with bright energy
before (explosion sound effect) shattering into a

00:42:34.569 --> 00:42:40.534
diamond dust across his chest, across the altar,
clattering to the ground like a glittering handful

00:42:40.534 --> 00:42:50.638
of sand just tossed across his body. The glyphs
fade and grow cold, the light of the room descends

00:42:50.638 --> 00:43:03.118
into the same low-lit candlelight that you
presented to the ritual, Pike. A moment passes.

00:43:03.118 --> 00:43:14.885
Another moment passes. Another moment passes, and

00:43:14.885 --> 00:43:19.398
eyes still closed, you watch as a small smile
curls across Scanlan's face.

00:43:19.398 --> 00:43:29.499
And his chest rises, and falls, and rises, and
falls.

00:43:29.499 --> 00:43:37.301
As the relief spreads throughout the room,
Kaylie walks up,

00:43:37.301 --> 00:43:40.374
"Wipe that smile off your face. We're gonna have a
talk."

00:43:40.374 --> 00:43:47.086
and slaps his face the other way, jumps off the
altar, slams out the two doors to the front,

00:43:47.086 --> 00:43:57.282
and staggers out of the temple into the outside.

00:43:57.282 --> 00:43:59.734
Scanlan still lays unconscious but breathing.

00:43:59.734 --> 00:44:03.585
I rolled a natural fucking 20, by the way 
guys, on that final roll.

00:44:03.585 --> 00:44:04.588
TRAVIS: Did you really?

00:44:04.588 --> 00:44:05.586
ASHLEY: No way.

00:44:05.586 --> 00:44:09.005
MATT: It's right there. I haven't touched it since
it landed.

00:44:09.005 --> 00:44:10.601
MARISHA: That was two natural 20s.

00:44:10.601 --> 00:44:12.048
ASHLEY: Two!

00:44:12.048 --> 00:44:15.414
MATT: Two natural 20s. It was 14 for Kaylie's
performance roll, and then a 20.

00:44:15.414 --> 00:44:16.525
LAURA: You know,

00:44:16.525 --> 00:44:17.687
ASHLEY: Holy moly.

00:44:17.687 --> 00:44:19.528
LAURA: The fates just wanted Scanlan to
come back.

00:44:19.528 --> 00:44:23.338
MARISHA: It's true. And he was all poo-pooing on
the dice

00:44:23.338 --> 00:44:24.477
LAURA: I know.

00:44:24.477 --> 00:44:29.565
MATT: There was--I mean with the DC increase,
because he was at a 12. I missaid 13 last week, it

00:44:29.565 --> 00:44:36.078
was a 12, and we had two successes and one
failure. That brought it from a 13, ten, to a

00:44:36.078 --> 00:44:39.420
seven. So we had a one through six and he would
have been good.

00:44:39.420 --> 00:44:41.051
LAURA: Oh, good.

00:44:41.051 --> 00:44:42.990
ASHLEY: &nbsp;That responsibility is so scary.

00:44:42.990 --> 00:44:47.089
MATT: Yeah. Anyway.

00:44:47.089 --> 00:44:59.083
As you all take in the moment, it appears 
that Scanlan's spirit has returned to the body.

00:44:59.083 --> 00:45:04.518
TRAVIS: Anybody wanna wake him up?

00:45:04.518 --> 00:45:10.334
TALIESIN: No. I don't think so, not yet.

00:45:10.334 --> 00:45:14.945
MARISHA: Keyleth goes up and does a simple
medicine check, just to see what's up with him.

00:45:14.945 --> 00:45:20.103
MATT: Go for it. Go ahead and roll it.

00:45:20.103 --> 00:45:21.854
MARISHA: 18.

00:45:21.854 --> 00:45:31.428
MATT: Okay. He is alive, and he's breathing. His
body has been ravaged by the experience and trauma

00:45:31.428 --> 00:45:36.395
of death. His body has been ravaged by the trauma
of the resurrection.

00:45:36.395 --> 00:45:39.033
He is borderline comatose
right now.

00:45:39.033 --> 00:45:41.784
LAURA: Oh, God.

00:45:41.784 --> 00:45:45.806
MATT: You've seen trauma have this
impact on bodies before.

00:45:45.806 --> 00:45:48.936
It could be minutes, hours, days, who knows?

00:45:48.936 --> 00:45:55.653
But with the right treatment, usually people 
recover. It's not like a heavy skull trauma

00:45:55.653 --> 00:46:03.252
induced coma, it's just the physical exhaustion 
of the experience. So there may or may not be

00:46:03.252 --> 00:46:11.413
something you could do at the moment to rouse 
him from his slumber, but Scanlan lives.

00:46:11.413 --> 00:46:13.728
MARISHA: I think he needs his rest.

00:46:13.728 --> 00:46:19.934
Percy, can we station some of the best 
sages and doctors to watch over him?

00:46:19.934 --> 00:46:22.450
TALIESIN: We take him to the castle, I suppose, at
this point.

00:46:22.450 --> 00:46:23.928
MARISHA: Yes.

00:46:23.928 --> 00:46:24.900
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:46:24.900 --> 00:46:27.853
TALIESIN: He'll be taken care of.

00:46:27.853 --> 00:46:30.594
TRAVIS: Do you mind if I carry him?

00:46:30.594 --> 00:46:34.179
MARISHA and TALIESIN: Of course.

00:46:34.179 --> 00:46:35.895
TRAVIS: I pick him up.

00:46:35.895 --> 00:46:42.747
MATT: Okay. He's warmer now.

00:46:42.747 --> 00:46:45.959
TRAVIS: That's better.

00:46:45.959 --> 00:46:48.673
MATT: He's also drooling a little bit, and may
have wet himself a second time.

00:46:48.673 --> 00:46:50.986
TRAVIS: That's more like it. Yeah, that's
appropriate.

00:46:50.986 --> 00:46:52.840
(all laugh)

00:46:52.840 --> 00:46:54.571
MATT: But he's warmer.

00:46:54.571 --> 00:46:58.262
TRAVIS: Everyone, he may have pissed himself.

00:46:58.262 --> 00:47:00.051
(all laugh)

00:47:00.051 --> 00:47:03.165
Just remind him later.

00:47:03.165 --> 00:47:04.438
ASHLEY: It happens.

00:47:04.438 --> 00:47:05.933
LIAM: The more things change...

00:47:05.933 --> 00:47:08.650
(all laugh)

00:47:08.650 --> 00:47:12.315
MATT: All right, as you guys begin to 
step outside--

00:47:12.315 --> 00:47:20.748
Kerrek, you're there at the door after Kaylie
charged out. Kima and Allura, who are just waiting

00:47:20.748 --> 00:47:28.507
outside, respectfully, are kind of engaged, but
you watch as Kima immediately pushes up

00:47:28.507 --> 00:47:32.693
"Is he--?"

00:47:32.693 --> 00:47:34.457
TALIESIN: He'll be fine.

00:47:34.457 --> 00:47:40.134
MATT: "(sighs and then scoffs) And you were
worried. So dumb."

00:47:40.134 --> 00:47:42.892
(laughs all around)

00:47:42.892 --> 00:47:47.787
Allura steps up behind her and puts her hands on
Kima's shoulders and goes,

00:47:47.787 --> 00:48:00.970
"Well, that's good news. Take care of him. We'll 
probably return to Emon and help helm the

00:48:00.970 --> 00:48:08.126
"remainder of the cleaning, and situation, of Emon:
gather the dead, see who we still have alive,

00:48:08.126 --> 00:48:15.036
"and come back soon with an 
idea of what we have to rebuild."

00:48:15.036 --> 00:48:17.045
MARISHA: Can I do an insight check?

00:48:17.045 --> 00:48:17.907
MATT: Sure.

00:48:17.907 --> 00:48:23.656
MARISHA: She seems worried. Is something wrong?

00:48:23.656 --> 00:48:25.019
MARISHA: 26.

00:48:25.019 --> 00:48:31.552
MATT: 26.

00:48:31.552 --> 00:48:33.255
ASHLEY: So, lootcrate.

00:48:33.255 --> 00:48:34.947
(everyone laughs)

00:48:34.947 --> 00:48:37.139
LAURA: So building, huh?

00:48:37.139 --> 00:48:41.019
ASHLEY: It's such a cool thing, what they have
this month.

00:48:41.019 --> 00:48:42.565
LAURA: (laughs)

00:48:42.565 --> 00:48:49.801
ASHLEY: You know, if you love power rangers and
leegos. I love leegos.

00:48:49.801 --> 00:48:51.376
TRAVIS: You know, man, these lootcrates are great.

00:48:51.376 --> 00:48:54.034
ASHLEY: Can't do it like Sam.

00:48:54.034 --> 00:48:54.792
MATT: Who can, though?

00:48:54.792 --> 00:48:55.809
TRAVIS: If you haven't got one, you should.

00:48:55.809 --> 00:48:57.253
LIAM: Hey everybody. Scanlan's still in the game.

00:48:57.253 --> 00:49:00.036
(all cheer)

00:49:00.036 --> 00:49:02.132
LIAM: (badly plays a flute)

00:49:02.132 --> 00:49:07.510
(all laugh)

00:49:07.510 --> 00:49:10.438
MARISHA: Do you have to leave immediately? You
seem tired.

00:49:10.438 --> 00:49:14.197
We've all been through a lot. You
should rest a day.

00:49:14.197 --> 00:49:20.410
MATT: &nbsp;I mean, I have to rest before I can find
our way back to Emon quicker, but the sooner the

00:49:20.410 --> 00:49:27.098
better. We did kind of leave the city in a vacuum
of leadership, depending on who survived the

00:49:27.098 --> 00:49:33.799
conflict there, and I want to make sure that we
have whatever remains of the council there to put

00:49:33.799 --> 00:49:43.767
the pieces back together and count the dead; make
sure we don't leave a vacuum of power so that

00:49:43.767 --> 00:49:50.836
another Thordak-like entity can sweep in and lead
us back on a dark path.

00:49:50.836 --> 00:49:52.937
MARISHA: Let us know if you need our assistance

00:49:52.937 --> 00:50:00.484
MATT: " I shall. (sighs) I, for one, need to get
clean."

00:50:00.484 --> 00:50:03.584
She taps Kima's shoulders, and Kima says,

00:50:03.584 --> 00:50:05.406
"Me too,"

00:50:05.406 --> 00:50:12.431
and they both walk up towards the
castle. What do you guys want to do?

00:50:12.431 --> 00:50:16.673
TALIESIN: I am going to go back the castle, sit
down, take this off,

00:50:16.673 --> 00:50:20.771
and I think sleep for a long
while.

00:50:20.771 --> 00:50:23.929
MARISHA: Oh, yeah. What time of day is it?

00:50:23.929 --> 00:50:31.780
MATT: At this time, the arrival here... It's
pushing past sunset, I'm pretty sure. Or if not,

00:50:31.780 --> 00:50:36.263
it's probably early night at this time with the
hour for the ritual, so--

00:50:36.263 --> 00:50:40.025
TRAVIS: Where are we dropping off the urine
smelling one?

00:50:40.025 --> 00:50:43.854
TALIESIN: We'll take him to his room. I'll make
sure someone cleans him up,

00:50:43.854 --> 00:50:47.119
dresses him, puts his
things away.

00:50:47.119 --> 00:50:51.396
TRAVIS: All right.

00:50:51.396 --> 00:50:54.326
TALIESIN: You're welcome to take him to his room.

00:50:54.326 --> 00:50:55.734
TRAVIS: I do that.

00:50:55.734 --> 00:50:58.183
ASHLEY: I'll go with Grog and Scanlan.

00:50:58.183 --> 00:51:00.946
MATT: Okay. Kerrek?

00:51:00.946 --> 00:51:07.309
PATRICK: I probably just drift along in everyone's
wake at this point.

00:51:07.309 --> 00:51:18.122
MATT: Okay. Staggering behind a bit, just
ruminating on the current events. Vex, you are

00:51:18.325 --> 00:51:23.895
still back at Kymal with Eskil Ryndarien, who has
come back with drinks and says,

00:51:23.895 --> 00:51:32.079
"So...what business have you here, to drag me 
this far out to town?"

00:51:32.079 --> 00:51:38.833
LAURA: I thought you were grabbing a room, Eskil.
Aren't you tired? Just so tired.

00:51:38.833 --> 00:51:40.536
(laughter)

00:51:40.536 --> 00:51:43.525
MATT: "Well, I suppose--"

00:51:43.525 --> 00:51:47.225
LAURA: We probably need our sleep right so that we
can recharge

00:51:47.225 --> 00:51:49.927
those spells of yours as soon as
possible.

00:51:49.927 --> 00:51:52.282
MATT: I just want you to know that I'm not
interested.

00:51:52.282 --> 00:51:53.693
(laughter)

00:51:53.693 --> 00:51:56.407
LAURA: (dryly) Oh, are you sure, darling? You're
so attractive to me.

00:51:56.407 --> 00:52:00.763
MATT: I understand that, and I've had my heyday,
but those years are long past me now.

00:52:00.763 --> 00:52:03.616
LAURA: Well, you better get to bed before I jump
on you.

00:52:03.616 --> 00:52:05.181
(all laugh)

00:52:05.181 --> 00:52:09.137
MATT: And he seems legitimately really disturbed
and walks away.

00:52:09.137 --> 00:52:12.096
LAURA: I sit down next to Doctor Dranzel.

00:52:12.096 --> 00:52:18.338
MATT: Okay, he's sitting. He's actually half
passed out now, in the back corner. He wasn't

00:52:18.338 --> 00:52:25.363
there for the whole exchange with Kaylie. His
hat's pushed over his eyes, and he has an empty

00:52:25.363 --> 00:52:31.240
tankard there in his one hand. You don't see where
his other hand is. And you sit down?

00:52:31.240 --> 00:52:33.982
LAURA: I look to see where his other hand is.

00:52:33.982 --> 00:52:39.694
MATT: All right. You glance under the table and
you come right face to face with a crossbow that

00:52:39.694 --> 00:52:44.093
is under the table pointed in your direction, and
without moving, you hear him grin under his chin.

00:52:44.093 --> 00:52:47.569
"(laughs) Nice try, Vex'ahlia."

00:52:47.569 --> 00:52:51.919
LAURA: (laughs) Just seeing what it was, dear.
Didn't want to sit on it.

00:52:51.919 --> 00:52:54.532
MATT: So do you know my coin is mine?

00:52:54.532 --> 00:52:56.258
LAURA: As is mine.

00:52:56.258 --> 00:52:59.818
MATT: (chuckles) He puts the hat up a bit over his
eyes now, and you can see him.

00:52:59.818 --> 00:53:04.053
He gives you a sort
a brow push.

00:53:04.053 --> 00:53:07.144
LAURA: Did you hear what I said to Kaylie?

00:53:07.144 --> 00:53:08.973
MATT: As much as I could from a distance, yeah.

00:53:08.973 --> 00:53:15.777
Seems our old pal finally had his adventures catch
up to him.

00:53:15.777 --> 00:53:18.522
LAURA: How do you feel about that?

00:53:18.522 --> 00:53:23.060
MATT: I've had friends come and go through the
years. It's part of the job.

00:53:23.060 --> 00:53:26.710
LAURA: That can't be true. That cold...

00:53:26.710 --> 00:53:32.880
MATT: Well, no. Each one hurts, but-- Look, doll,
I've lived in some of the harshest landscapes

00:53:32.880 --> 00:53:36.640
Tal'dorei and beyond has to see. I've watched
people torn asunder in the streets before me.

00:53:36.640 --> 00:53:39.048
I have--

00:53:39.048 --> 00:53:42.035
LAURA: I hold onto my purse the entire time
talking to him.

00:53:42.035 --> 00:53:42.763
MATT: Okay.

00:53:42.763 --> 00:53:45.036
(all laugh)

00:53:45.036 --> 00:53:48.533
TALIESIN: That was so subtle.

00:53:48.533 --> 00:53:55.593
MATT: Make a perception check.

00:53:55.593 --> 00:53:57.527
LIAM: There's a lot in there.

00:53:57.527 --> 00:53:59.517
LAURA: Motherfuck.

00:53:59.517 --> 00:54:01.601
TRAVIS: You know your own kind.

00:54:01.601 --> 00:54:03.219
LAURA: 22.

00:54:03.219 --> 00:54:11.951
MATT: 22. You catch the crossbow still placed
there, but his other hand has slipped underneath

00:54:11.951 --> 00:54:14.038
and has been slowly reaching toward your-

00:54:14.038 --> 00:54:15.965
LAURA: Trying to cop a feel, darling?

00:54:15.965 --> 00:54:17.944
MATT: (laughs) Always.

00:54:17.944 --> 00:54:25.266
TRAVIS: (laughing) He wiped a nose on his cheek.

00:54:25.266 --> 00:54:27.614
MARISHA: So crass.

00:54:27.614 --> 00:54:34.440
MATT: But, yeah. Not cold, just pragmatic. When
you lose enough people you learn to just move on.

00:54:34.440 --> 00:54:37.407
LAURA: Yeah, but Scanlan's special.

00:54:37.407 --> 00:54:43.635
MATT: He's a special pain in my ass. Nah, he's
great. He'll be missed.

00:54:43.635 --> 00:54:51.066
LAURA: He will be. To Scanlan

00:54:51.066 --> 00:55:00.982
MATT: To Scanlan Shorthalt and our brief but very
lucrative carrier together. By the way, if you're

00:55:00.982 --> 00:55:06.012
curious, we're looking to sell off some of this
really nice silverware that we--

00:55:06.012 --> 00:55:08.674
LAURA: You motherfucker.

00:55:08.674 --> 00:55:11.625
TRAVIS: (laughs) That's right, it's ours. Shit.

00:55:11.625 --> 00:55:15.970
MATT: He just smiles at you, his big bright toothy
grin.

00:55:15.970 --> 00:55:20.654
LAURA: You're lucky that our keep was under attack
and everything else got ransacked.

00:55:20.654 --> 00:55:23.070
Otherwise, I'd come after you.

00:55:23.070 --> 00:55:27.640
MATT: I'm always lucky. That's why I'm still
alive.

00:55:27.640 --> 00:55:31.550
LAURA: Well, give some of your luck to Scanlan.
I'm going to bed.

00:55:31.550 --> 00:55:37.344
MATT: All right. I've got a few more of these to
put down. Stay safe, Vex'ahlia.

00:55:37.344 --> 00:55:43.924
LAURA: Yeah. Don't come to my room. I'm serious,
don't.

00:55:43.924 --> 00:55:46.032
MATT: He looks legitimately-- like the wink
afterward--

00:55:46.032 --> 00:55:49.529
his face has a mixed signals
expression.

00:55:49.529 --> 00:55:51.654
(all laugh)

00:55:51.654 --> 00:55:53.066
TRAVIS: Question mark.

00:55:53.066 --> 00:55:54.951
ASHLEY: Don't come to my room.

00:55:54.951 --> 00:55:58.359
MATT: I'm not sure if you're serious...

00:55:58.359 --> 00:55:59.956
LAURA: But seriously, don't.

00:55:59.956 --> 00:56:03.086
MATT: Right, right, no. Gotcha. Psh, yes, fine.

00:56:03.086 --> 00:56:08.077
Besides, you seem like you're already shacking up
with a... curious gentleman.

00:56:08.077 --> 00:56:10.286
LAURA: (sarcastically) Isn't he dreamy?

00:56:10.286 --> 00:56:11.657
And I head upstairs.

00:56:11.657 --> 00:56:13.146
MATT: "Strange bedfellows."

00:56:13.146 --> 00:56:15.251
(all laugh)

00:56:15.251 --> 00:56:17.270
He goes and orders another round.

00:56:17.270 --> 00:56:22.420
You go ahead and find yourself up there 
with two separate rooms purchased by Eskil,

00:56:22.420 --> 00:56:26.811
all the way across the hall. He rapidly hands 
you the key, and says without making eye contact,

00:56:26.811 --> 00:56:29.307
"Your room is at the end, please, yes,"

00:56:29.307 --> 00:56:37.631
and finds his way. You hear the door
(clicking sound) and lock behind him

00:56:37.631 --> 00:56:42.365
LAURA: I stay up for a really long time waiting to
hear any kind of word from Allura,

00:56:42.365 --> 00:56:46.018
from anybody... Something.

00:56:46.018 --> 00:56:48.375
MATT: Well, nobody told Allura to contact you.

00:56:48.375 --> 00:56:49.465
LAURA: Nope, they didn't.

00:56:49.465 --> 00:56:50.452
MATT: No.

00:56:50.452 --> 00:56:51.459
TRAVIS: Oh, shit!

00:56:51.459 --> 00:56:53.188
LAURA: So I'll eventually go to sleep, wondering
if Scanlan's alive.

00:56:53.188 --> 00:56:55.480
MARISHA: We weren't done on our side.

00:56:55.480 --> 00:56:57.411
ASHLEY: We can't-- that's-- the earrings--

00:56:57.411 --> 00:56:59.688
TALIESIN: Technically, chronologically, it
wouldn't have happened yet, yeah?

00:56:59.688 --> 00:57:05.326
MATT: Yeah. So, as she is going throughout the
room and napping through the day--

00:57:05.326 --> 00:57:13.064
It's taken you guys hours to prepare the ritual, 
bring Kaylie there, the whole circumstance,

00:57:13.064 --> 00:57:16.177
so yeah, she's been up for a few hours, waiting.

00:57:16.177 --> 00:57:19.573
The rest of you guys back at the castle, anything 
else you want to prep for the evening?

00:57:19.573 --> 00:57:23.377
LIAM: In the meantime I wander over to Kerrek,
just for a minute, and I say

00:57:23.377 --> 00:57:29.632
Kerr, I'm really terrible about lending my stuff. 
I forget who I've given what,

00:57:29.632 --> 00:57:30.960
and sometimes it doesn't come back.

00:57:30.960 --> 00:57:33.475
(all laugh)

00:57:33.475 --> 00:57:37.786
LIAM: Could I, I'm so sorry, could I trouble you
for that ring back, please?

00:57:37.786 --> 00:57:43.403
PATRICK: Oh, oh, oh. No, he just takes it off. He
hands it back.

00:57:43.403 --> 00:57:44.942
TRAVIS: Aww, damn it.

00:57:44.942 --> 00:57:46.347
LAURA: That was awesome!

00:57:46.347 --> 00:57:50.855
LIAM: Thank you, thank you. Oh, that is beautiful.
Right back where it belongs.

00:57:50.855 --> 00:57:53.322
MARISHA: Keyleth taps Vax and says,

00:57:53.322 --> 00:57:56.796
Smooth. Nice one.

00:57:56.796 --> 00:57:58.644
LIAM: That's me.

00:57:58.644 --> 00:58:04.340
MARISHA: And I turn to Kerrek and just give him a
massive hug.

00:58:04.340 --> 00:58:12.676
Thank you so much for following us
into the fray. Literally, into the pit of the

00:58:12.676 --> 00:58:22.107
beast-- So, thank you. There's not a lot of people
who would blindly follow us there.

00:58:22.107 --> 00:58:29.664
PATRICK: It was a pleasure, and it was a double
pleasure to actually come out again.

00:58:29.664 --> 00:58:36.830
MARISHA: I don't know if would say risking your
life is a pleasure, but I appreciate your positive

00:58:36.830 --> 00:58:41.590
attitude on the whole thing. (chuckles)

00:58:41.590 --> 00:58:50.269
PATRICK: It was nice to have something to do
again. Something worthwhile to do again.

00:58:50.269 --> 00:58:59.225
MARISHA: I'd say you definitely spent your time
wisely. What do you plan to do next?

00:58:59.225 --> 00:59:08.900
PATRICK: If you folk are heading back to the city
tomorrow, I should meet up with my people. They

00:59:08.900 --> 00:59:17.638
don't need me to shepherd them, exactly, but I
should head back with them.

00:59:17.638 --> 00:59:30.336
MARISHA: Okay. Well, thank you for everything.
Sincerely.

00:59:30.336 --> 00:59:34.440
I give him another hug and say
goodnight and go in the castle.

00:59:34.440 --> 00:59:38.731
MATT: Okay

00:59:38.731 --> 00:59:42.798
ASHLEY: I'm going to stay with Scanlan for a bit.
Just for the night.

00:59:42.877 --> 00:59:46.271
MATT: Okay, so you take him back to his chamber.

00:59:46.271 --> 00:59:49.237
You stay next to him as he's sleeping, making sure
he's okay.

00:59:49.237 --> 00:59:52.644
All right. Everyone else, just--

00:59:52.644 --> 00:59:54.921
TRAVIS: I'm just staying outside his room.

00:59:54.921 --> 00:59:55.730
MATT: Okay.

00:59:55.730 --> 01:00:01.012
MARISHA: I then go, I was going to go find Allura
and actually ask her if she had a message spell or

01:00:01.012 --> 01:00:05.282
a sending spell, and I was totally gonna do that
before

01:00:05.282 --> 01:00:07.176
(all laugh)

01:00:07.176 --> 01:00:13.030
everyone staring making the jokes about us being
shitty and forgetting.

01:00:13.030 --> 01:00:14.587
Because that would be
awful--

01:00:14.587 --> 01:00:16.958
TALIESIN: I was really looking forward to it, to
be honest.

01:00:16.958 --> 01:00:19.873
MARISHA: --to wait for 12 hours to figure out if
your friend is alive or dead.

01:00:19.873 --> 01:00:24.497
(all singing) Somewhere out there--

01:00:24.497 --> 01:00:32.135
MATT: Yeah, as you go find her, she's already 
in her night clothes

01:00:32.135 --> 01:00:34.133
and has brought her hair down and is like,

01:00:34.133 --> 01:00:38.362
"Yes, actually, I can.
Thank you for reminding me."

01:00:38.362 --> 01:00:44.921
MARISHA: She must be insane right now, or half
drunk, or both.

01:00:44.921 --> 01:00:45.926
MATT: Probably both.

01:00:45.926 --> 01:00:47.729
MARISHA: Yeah, I would be.

01:00:47.729 --> 01:00:49.970
MATT: I will make sure she knows.

01:00:49.970 --> 01:00:51.455
MARISHA: Okay, thank you.

01:00:51.455 --> 01:00:55.501
MATT: Of course, of course. Sleep well. You've
done-- you've done good.

01:00:55.501 --> 01:00:57.691
MARISHA: You, too. Thank you.

01:00:57.691 --> 01:01:02.329
MATT: You've all finished what I started.

01:01:02.329 --> 01:01:07.134
MARISHA: I think we'll head back with you tomorrow
to Emon so we can check in on our keep,

01:01:07.134 --> 01:01:09.688
once Vex'ahila comes back, of course

01:01:09.688 --> 01:01:16.329
MATT: "Very well. I can bring most of you with me.
Should not be an issue.

01:01:16.329 --> 01:01:19.832
All right, rest well. Have a good night."

01:01:19.832 --> 01:01:25.064
She goes back inside.

01:01:25.064 --> 01:01:32.797
PATRICK: Kerrek will probably track down a bottle
of some kind of

01:01:32.797 --> 01:01:41.637
really strong liquor and look for Grog.

01:01:41.637 --> 01:01:45.840
MATT: Okay, it doesn't take you long to find it.
You've seen where they keep most of it and since

01:01:45.840 --> 01:01:53.817
you're already an esteemed guest of the keepers
here of Whitestone, they have given you a bottle,

01:01:53.817 --> 01:02:01.888
already open, but promised to have been fine
quality and it doesn't take you long to hear the

01:02:01.888 --> 01:02:08.837
various bodily functions of Grog Strongjaw in the
hallway, watching Scanlan's room. As it's

01:02:08.837 --> 01:02:15.451
now the middle of the night, close to midnight or
so, you come across Grog alone leaning up against

01:02:15.451 --> 01:02:21.108
the wall, arms crossed, just waiting outside of
Scanlan's room.

01:02:21.108 --> 01:02:29.686
PATRICK: And I just kind of pass the bottle over
and say,

01:02:29.686 --> 01:02:37.409
Well, this is a better sort of vigil than
what I've seen in the past.

01:02:37.409 --> 01:02:45.744
TRAVIS: Why, that is true, that could have been
much-- what is this?

01:02:45.744 --> 01:02:52.849
PATRICK: They seemed really impressed that
they were giving it to me.

01:02:52.849 --> 01:02:54.411
TRAVIS: They gave it to you. You didn't--

01:02:54.411 --> 01:02:57.714
PATRICK: That's the extent of my knowledge. It
looks brownish.

01:02:57.714 --> 01:03:03.725
TRAVIS: You didn't pay for it, no coin. You don't
know if it's, like, cheap or expensive.

01:03:03.725 --> 01:03:10.842
PATRICK: Yeah, I'm guessing it's top shelf, not
that I would know.

01:03:10.842 --> 01:03:13.358
TRAVIS: Hold on, let an expert take a taste.

01:03:13.358 --> 01:03:16.134
And I take a sip.

01:03:16.134 --> 01:03:19.337
(all laugh)

01:03:19.337 --> 01:03:23.257
TRAVIS: Do I detect any notes of stuff?

01:03:23.257 --> 01:03:26.760
MATT: Roll an intelligence check.

01:03:26.810 --> 01:03:33.035
TRAVIS: Come on, Gil. That's a three... No,
that's a one.

01:03:33.229 --> 01:03:40.681
MATT: You detect notes of alcohol. Very strong
alcohol.

01:03:40.681 --> 01:03:42.073
LAURA: And liquid.

01:03:42.073 --> 01:03:48.438
TRAVIS: Yes, this is clearly the finest reserve
alcohol of the... area.

01:03:48.438 --> 01:03:54.868
We shall enjoy this to great lengths. May I 
commend you on the acquisition of a great--

01:03:54.868 --> 01:04:03.478
I think I just stroked
out on that word. Here.

01:04:03.478 --> 01:04:07.170
PATRICK: And so I just kind of share some space.

01:04:07.170 --> 01:04:16.805
We chat a bit, and then I kind of bring up that
whole resurrection ritual, slowly like,

01:04:16.805 --> 01:04:22.801
So that sort of thing has happened before 
with you folks?

01:04:22.801 --> 01:04:28.012
TRAVIS: Yeah, it has, unfortunately. A bit too
often.

01:04:28.012 --> 01:04:33.912
But I have to say, before this group, I
didn't even know people could do that, 'cause you

01:04:33.912 --> 01:04:42.261
know me. I can't do anything like that. Have you
ever done one of those?

01:04:42.261 --> 01:04:56.191
PATRICK: I... No, no. I... (sighs) I've looked
into things like that,

01:04:56.191 --> 01:05:01.124
but I've never known
anyone who's actually come back.

01:05:01.124 --> 01:05:03.918
TRAVIS: Really?

01:05:03.918 --> 01:05:06.991
PATRICK: Yeah.

01:05:06.991 --> 01:05:14.212
TRAVIS: Wait, so are you saying, someone coming
back is rare?

01:05:14.212 --> 01:05:26.862
PATRICK: I've, I mean, I've heard stories, and I
know, but I've never seen it myself and I've

01:05:26.862 --> 01:05:39.277
never... I don't know how much. I never knew how
practical any of the stories were before.

01:05:39.277 --> 01:05:48.426
TRAVIS: I don't really know how pra-- pracsti--
they are either, but I guess I hadn't really

01:05:48.426 --> 01:05:55.845
thought about it much. It just seems like the
others in the group are responsible for it. This

01:05:55.845 --> 01:06:07.105
one was hard, though. I felt like it might not
work, you know?

01:06:07.105 --> 01:06:10.393
PATRICK: So it always works?

01:06:10.393 --> 01:06:22.007
TRAVIS: Well, yeah. I mean, of the ones I've seen.

01:06:22.007 --> 01:06:34.075
PATRICK: And has it always been--? How-- do you
need a body?

01:06:34.075 --> 01:06:41.917
TRAVIS: Uh... for what? To stay warm at night or
for a resurrection?

01:06:41.917 --> 01:06:43.907
(all laugh)

01:06:43.907 --> 01:06:50.679
PATRICK: No no, for a-- have you ever brought
someone back when you didn't have the body?

01:06:50.679 --> 01:06:56.645
TRAVIS: No?

01:06:56.645 --> 01:06:58.366
PATRICK: I expected that couldn't happen.

01:06:58.366 --> 01:07:06.099
TRAVIS: Oh, okay. Cause that would be-- what
would you use? Like, you can't bring along, like,

01:07:06.099 --> 01:07:12.415
a tea cosy and then be like bam! You're back! How
would that even work? What are you talking about?

01:07:12.415 --> 01:07:15.349
PATRICK: Exactly, how would any of that work?

01:07:15.349 --> 01:07:21.550
And that is about as subtle as Kerrek can be at
this point.

01:07:21.550 --> 01:07:29.126
Awake for three days and two wars and
a dragon. That's why he's desperately trying to

01:07:29.126 --> 01:07:33.025
pump Grog for information about how the hell
someone can come back--

01:07:33.025 --> 01:07:34.268
TRAVIS: You picked the wrong source.

01:07:34.268 --> 01:07:35.742
(all laugh)

01:07:35.742 --> 01:07:36.511
MATT: Yeah.

01:07:36.511 --> 01:07:41.625
TRAVIS: You know, if you have questions, the wall
behind me also knows probably as much as I do.

01:07:41.625 --> 01:07:44.121
(all laugh)

01:07:44.121 --> 01:07:52.900
PATRICK: And that's like, this is especially the
only person I could trust to not realize that I

01:07:52.900 --> 01:07:56.414
was trying to get information out of him on this
subject.

01:07:56.414 --> 01:07:58.742
MATT: Yeah. (laughs)

01:07:58.742 --> 01:08:06.591
PATRICK: And then when it does not-- when it dead
ends, I just drink as much of that bottle as I

01:08:06.591 --> 01:08:13.120
can, moving it back and forth between the two of
us for the rest of the night.

01:08:13.120 --> 01:08:14.538
TRAVIS: I'm good with that.

01:08:14.538 --> 01:08:16.441
ASHLEY: Do I hear them at all on the other side of
the door?

01:08:16.441 --> 01:08:21.357
MATT: You hear them muttering from across the
wall, but do you wanna listen in?

01:08:21.357 --> 01:08:24.289
TALIESIN: I was actually hoping to be around the
corner for a chunk of this,

01:08:24.289 --> 01:08:26.491
'cause I was heading to
Scanlan's room as well.

01:08:26.491 --> 01:08:28.122
MATT: Both of you guys make perception checks.

01:08:28.122 --> 01:08:28.764
ASHLEY: Okay.

01:08:28.764 --> 01:08:33.005
TALIESIN: Awesome.

01:08:33.005 --> 01:08:38.414
TRAVIS: So you, like, you take a big shiny thing,
and then someone starts like "ay-ay-ah".

01:08:38.414 --> 01:08:39.074
TALIESIN: 14.

01:08:39.074 --> 01:08:41.885
ASHLEY: 19.

01:08:41.885 --> 01:08:43.306
MATT: You're around the way.

01:08:43.306 --> 01:08:46.910
You catch the tail end of the conversation, 
just the questioning back and forth.

01:08:46.910 --> 01:08:54.464
You pick up bits and pieces of it, and you're 
able to make out the gist of the conversation.

01:08:54.464 --> 01:08:59.362
ASHLEY: Okay, I'm gonna peek my head out the door.

01:08:59.362 --> 01:09:03.896
MATT: Okay, as you guys are finishing passing the
bottle back and forth, Scanlan's door opens and

01:09:03.947 --> 01:09:07.533
Pike just barely pushes her head out from the
crack.

01:09:07.533 --> 01:09:08.458
ASHLEY: Hey.

01:09:08.458 --> 01:09:13.813
TRAVIS: Aaah! Oh my god!

01:09:13.813 --> 01:09:21.140
ASHLEY: What are you drinking? And why didn't you
bring some to me?

01:09:21.140 --> 01:09:25.142
TRAVIS: Shit. Really good point. We might be in
trouble, Kerr.

01:09:25.142 --> 01:09:35.065
PATRICK: I... have made a terrible mistake. But it
is one that I can fix.

01:09:35.065 --> 01:09:40.171
And I know this is why the
gods gave us two hands.

01:09:40.171 --> 01:09:43.449
I will bring back two
bottles.

01:09:43.449 --> 01:09:46.127
TRAVIS: Is this why the gods gave us two hands?

01:09:46.127 --> 01:09:48.579
(all laugh)

01:09:48.579 --> 01:09:53.584
TRAVIS: They gave us two hands for two bott--
Pike, I am so wise right now.

01:09:53.584 --> 01:09:58.266
ASHLEY: You are--that must be like an intelligence
serum.

01:09:58.266 --> 01:10:01.347
TRAVIS: Serum. Did they teach you that in your
Sarenrae temple classes,

01:10:01.347 --> 01:10:07.468
because if not, maybe you
have a thing or two to teach them now.

01:10:07.468 --> 01:10:11.429
ASHLEY: Probably not, Grog, but thank you.

01:10:11.429 --> 01:10:13.644
TALIESIN: All right, now I am coming around the
corner. I've waited long enough.

01:10:13.644 --> 01:10:20.877
MATT: So, Percival, you hear just enough to hear
the talk about needing a body and then alcohol.

01:10:20.877 --> 01:10:26.607
TRAVIS: Percy, the gods gave you two hands for
bottles for each of them!

01:10:26.607 --> 01:10:29.822
TALIESIN: Four if you can learn to use your feet.

01:10:29.822 --> 01:10:33.099
TRAVIS: That's too much. My brain will explode.

01:10:33.099 --> 01:10:37.780
ASHLEY: Can I insight check him, since I knew,
since I could hear what was going on?

01:10:37.780 --> 01:10:41.187
MATT: Uh, sure. Make it with disadvantage, because
it was through a wall.

01:10:41.187 --> 01:10:42.953
ASHLEY: Okay.

01:10:42.953 --> 01:10:45.669
MATT: It's hard to pick up nuances without seeing
expressions and stuff.

01:10:45.669 --> 01:10:47.989
LIAM: It's just bass.

01:10:47.989 --> 01:10:53.070
MATT: Yeah, bass, practically.

01:10:53.119 --> 01:10:54.549
ASHLEY: 18.

01:10:54.549 --> 01:10:58.952
MATT: 18? It's too hard to pick up without
the nuances. From through a wall, I mean, the fact

01:10:58.952 --> 01:11:05.632
that you could pick up any of the words is one
thing, but most of insight is based around facial

01:11:05.632 --> 01:11:09.419
expressions, physical activity. You have no idea.

01:11:09.419 --> 01:11:11.574
TRAVIS: Probably some intermittent farting.

01:11:11.574 --> 01:11:16.066
MATT: That, too, yeah. So, you wander in. Kerr
wandered away.

01:11:16.066 --> 01:11:20.799
TALIESIN: I am going to wander into the room, with
a nod and just sit for a moment.

01:11:20.799 --> 01:11:26.195
TRAVIS: Wait. Prove that you're you.

01:11:26.195 --> 01:11:27.722
TALIESIN: No.

01:11:27.722 --> 01:11:28.797
TRAVIS: It's you.

01:11:28.797 --> 01:11:39.708
(all laugh)

01:11:39.708 --> 01:11:42.150
TALIESIN: I love you so much.

01:11:42.150 --> 01:11:44.857
MATT: All right, so you sit for a bit, Kerr
eventually returns

01:11:44.857 --> 01:11:48.809
with a second bottle of
matching alcohol, unopened though, the same--

01:11:48.809 --> 01:11:51.724
PATRICK: &nbsp;Two, two hands.

01:11:51.724 --> 01:11:54.559
MATT: Oh, so you go for a third bottle as well.

01:11:54.559 --> 01:11:55.450
PATRICK: Yes.

01:11:55.450 --> 01:12:01.096
MATT: Two unopened bottles of the same brackish
liquor.

01:12:01.096 --> 01:12:10.592
PATRICK: And I'll pass one to both of the people,
that I was not drinking with before.

01:12:10.592 --> 01:12:11.864
I'll pass them off.

01:12:11.864 --> 01:12:15.355
MATT: Okay, so Pike and Percival, you have a fresh
bottle jammed into your hand.

01:12:15.355 --> 01:12:17.909
ASHLEY: One for me.

01:12:17.909 --> 01:12:24.458
TALIESIN: I'll be passing this around a bit.

01:12:24.458 --> 01:12:29.717
ASHLEY: Should we all sit on the bed around
Scanlan, like a slumber party?

01:12:29.717 --> 01:12:31.541
TRAVIS: Is that creepy?

01:12:31.541 --> 01:12:34.437
TALIESIN: Honestly I am thinking about going
through his things, so no, I don't think it is.

01:12:34.437 --> 01:12:37.568
TRAVIS: Well, okay.

01:12:37.568 --> 01:12:39.891
(fart noise)

01:12:39.891 --> 01:12:43.818
MATT: Scanlan is definitely alive.

01:12:43.818 --> 01:12:54.155
ASHLEY: Oh my god. What were you guys talking
about out there? If I can be so rude to ask.

01:12:54.155 --> 01:12:55.578
TRAVIS: Oh, us?

01:12:55.578 --> 01:12:59.307
PATRICK: Uh, the liquor, it has fabulous brackish
notes.

01:12:59.307 --> 01:13:03.880
TRAVIS: Yep. Notes of brack.

01:13:03.880 --> 01:13:06.095
ASHLEY: Great, great.

01:13:06.095 --> 01:13:08.797
TALIESIN: Thank you. We make it here.

01:13:08.797 --> 01:13:17.353
TRAVIS: I was also talking about what a great job
you do. Apparently, you're really rare.

01:13:17.353 --> 01:13:19.400
ASHLEY: What do you mean?

01:13:19.400 --> 01:13:24.062
TRAVIS: Like, like, apparently, you and your
resurrections, like, they don't always work.

01:13:24.062 --> 01:13:26.445
Which is amazing.

01:13:26.445 --> 01:13:28.792
ASHLEY: They don't always work.

01:13:28.792 --> 01:13:30.066
TRAVIS: I didn't know that.

01:13:30.066 --> 01:13:35.064
ASHLEY: They don't. We've been very fortunate.
We've been very fortunate.

01:13:35.064 --> 01:13:40.312
What, did you-- why do you ask, Kerr?

01:13:40.312 --> 01:13:49.038
PATRICK: I've never actually seen anything like
that before. It was quite an experience.

01:13:49.038 --> 01:13:51.003
Am I still wearing my armor?

01:13:51.003 --> 01:13:52.740
I might actually ask that
out loud.

01:13:52.740 --> 01:13:54.418
(all laugh)

01:13:54.418 --> 01:14:01.664
MATT: And he is. He is still wearing his armor,
unwashed. A few of you have gotten washed, a few

01:14:01.664 --> 01:14:05.359
of you are still kind of, you know, going over the
events of today. Grog is not washed.

01:14:05.359 --> 01:14:06.589
LAURA: Grog never washes.

01:14:06.589 --> 01:14:07.253
MATT: Yes.

01:14:07.253 --> 01:14:08.802
TRAVIS: Perfume de Grog.

01:14:08.802 --> 01:14:10.890
MATT: So yes, he is still wearing his armor.

01:14:10.890 --> 01:14:19.004
PATRICK: You get the marvelous spectacle of a
slightly older, slightly portly man shrugging out

01:14:19.004 --> 01:14:27.656
of a full suit of chainmail. It's entertaining.

01:14:27.656 --> 01:14:40.095
And then just like dumps it on the floor, and then
like the padding underneath. (groans)

01:14:40.095 --> 01:14:43.380
TRAVIS: That's a lot of shit you're wearing, man.

01:14:43.380 --> 01:14:53.687
PATRICK: You know what I forgot over all these
years, like the sweat gathers in your ass.

01:14:53.687 --> 01:14:55.120
ASHLEY: Swamp ass.

01:14:55.120 --> 01:14:56.886
MARISHA: Swamp ass. Swamp crack, yeah.

01:14:56.886 --> 01:14:58.641
ASHLEY: It's a thing.

01:14:58.641 --> 01:15:04.958
PATRICK: You'd think that I would remember but no,
I had forgotten that.

01:15:04.958 --> 01:15:15.715
TALIESIN: I forget, and then suddenly I remember
that I met you all in a prison cell.

01:15:15.715 --> 01:15:20.335
ASHLEY: I remember very well.

01:15:20.335 --> 01:15:22.205
TALIESIN: It's not fair, is it?

01:15:22.205 --> 01:15:23.623
TRAVIS: What?

01:15:23.623 --> 01:15:32.197
TALIESIN: It's just, one day you lose so many
people and then just one day you stop.

01:15:32.197 --> 01:15:42.204
And at one point in your life you decide that 
suddenly for no reason, there's just--

01:15:42.204 --> 01:15:46.193
you're just not allowed to die yet. Your life just
isn't your own anymore, and suddenly you've

01:15:46.193 --> 01:15:53.046
done what you were supposed to do and now 
you're back. And it's just not yours anymore,

01:15:53.046 --> 01:16:04.509
is it? And what of everybody else? It's
not fair, any of it. I don't know.

01:16:04.509 --> 01:16:08.399
TRAVIS: You don't think your life is your own?

01:16:08.399 --> 01:16:15.291
TALIESIN: I know my life isn't my own. My life is
all of yours. My life is my sister's.

01:16:15.291 --> 01:16:25.045
My life is this castle's. My life ended.

01:16:25.045 --> 01:16:27.329
ASHLEY: Do you feel--

01:16:27.329 --> 01:16:37.958
TALIESIN: I'm very glad to be here. (laughs) I
just miss an awful lot of people, that's all.

01:16:37.958 --> 01:16:43.391
And I don't understand how we get to choose.

01:16:43.391 --> 01:16:48.609
TRAVIS: Oh.

01:16:48.609 --> 01:16:49.914
ASHLEY: I understand.

01:16:49.914 --> 01:16:51.049
TALIESIN: I know.

01:16:51.049 --> 01:16:52.661
TRAVIS: (whispers) I just got it too.

01:16:52.661 --> 01:16:53.483
ASHLEY: (whispers) Yeah.

01:16:53.483 --> 01:17:01.532
TALIESIN: I know you don't, Grog. I'm so grateful
that you don't.

01:17:01.532 --> 01:17:03.687
To the unyielding unfairness of
the universe.

01:17:03.687 --> 01:17:05.376
TRAVIS: Yep, raising drinks.

01:17:05.376 --> 01:17:07.089
LIAM: I'm not even here, and I'll drink to that
one.

01:17:07.089 --> 01:17:08.225
MARISHA: I know.

01:17:08.225 --> 01:17:09.269
LIAM: Fucking A.

01:17:09.269 --> 01:17:13.119
PATRICK: I'll drink.

01:17:13.119 --> 01:17:20.703
TALIESIN: And that it decided that we get to keep
this bastard. Hardly fair.

01:17:20.703 --> 01:17:23.765
TRAVIS: What do we tell him when he wakes up?

01:17:23.765 --> 01:17:26.380
TALIESIN: That's why I was thinking about going
through all of his things.

01:17:26.380 --> 01:17:28.974
We could just leave him
in a gutter somewhere.

01:17:28.974 --> 01:17:30.860
LAURA: (laughs)

01:17:30.860 --> 01:17:33.101
TALIESIN: Make him think he's reincarnated a
hundred years in the future. I don't know.

01:17:33.101 --> 01:17:35.480
I keep thinking of terrible things 
to do to him now.

01:17:35.480 --> 01:17:36.574
MARISHA: That's pretty funny.

01:17:36.574 --> 01:17:37.482
TALIESIN: I know.

01:17:37.482 --> 01:17:39.507
TRAVIS: I have not explored any of that, and it is
amazing.

01:17:39.507 --> 01:17:41.721
TALIESIN: I-- well, we were all troubled.

01:17:41.721 --> 01:17:47.590
I feel like once Vax is awake, we'll really 
have an expert at this sort of thing available.

01:17:47.590 --> 01:17:49.239
LIAM: Now's your chance to throw something in the
acid.

01:17:49.239 --> 01:17:52.108
(All laugh.)

01:17:52.108 --> 01:17:57.020
TALIESIN: I wish I could hear that!

01:17:57.020 --> 01:17:58.885
LIAM: Riegel's not even here.

01:17:58.885 --> 01:18:00.820
LAURA: Oh my god.

01:18:00.820 --> 01:18:03.141
LIAM: You could run roughshod over that
motherfucker.

01:18:03.141 --> 01:18:05.248
TALIESIN: You're not in the room. You're not in
the room, asshole!

01:18:05.248 --> 01:18:06.895
LIAM: This is Liam talking to Taliesin.

01:18:06.895 --> 01:18:16.109
TALIESIN: I know. I don't know if Percy is that--
has that much of a lack of propriety.

01:18:16.109 --> 01:18:20.519
He's really debating though. How much 
have we had to drink?

01:18:20.519 --> 01:18:23.052
MATT: Well, it's up to you. Other members in this
room have gotten quite drunk.

01:18:23.052 --> 01:18:28.241
MARISHA: Well, the math is always how much you've
had to drink versus distance it takes to travel to

01:18:28.241 --> 01:18:32.464
your goal, 'cause they kinda balance each other
out.

01:18:32.464 --> 01:18:33.528
MATT: Yeah.

01:18:33.528 --> 01:18:34.363
TRAVIS: That's true.

01:18:34.363 --> 01:18:35.269
MARISHA: The longer you have to go--

01:18:35.269 --> 01:18:36.716
TRAVIS: If you're stationary, that's one thing.

01:18:36.716 --> 01:18:46.155
MARISHA: Yeah, but, oh, I gotta go a mile? Ehh.
Half of it's down stairs? I don't know.

01:18:46.155 --> 01:18:49.087
ASHLEY: We could play a prank on him.

01:18:49.087 --> 01:18:54.365
TALIESIN: I think that's a great idea. I think I
need somebody with a better mind for this.

01:18:54.365 --> 01:18:56.936
TRAVIS: I walk out of the room.

01:18:56.936 --> 01:19:04.566
MATT: Grog leaves. Is there any other business you
guys want to conduct before the evening's done?

01:19:04.566 --> 01:19:07.634
ASHLEY: Did you want to go through his things?

01:19:07.634 --> 01:19:15.677
TALIESIN: A bit. That would be cruel. Well, you're
a decent person. Should we?

01:19:15.677 --> 01:19:17.003
ASHLEY: Well, I mean--

01:19:17.003 --> 01:19:25.662
PATRICK: Well, what if he happens to have
something on him that requires attention?

01:19:25.662 --> 01:19:31.400
ASHLEY: I actually would agree, 'cause what if
there's something, you know, that he needs our

01:19:31.400 --> 01:19:34.837
help with but feels weird about asking?

01:19:34.837 --> 01:19:45.547
PATRICK: Right. Or if he has-- if there's-- well,
I was thinking like a plant that needs watering--

01:19:45.547 --> 01:19:46.670
ASHLEY: Of course.

01:19:46.670 --> 01:19:50.492
PATRICK: Except something you would have in your
pocket, which is not a plant.

01:19:50.492 --> 01:19:54.561
MATT: Kerr, by the way, is pretty trashed at this
point.

01:19:54.561 --> 01:19:57.904
LIAM: Thanks for clarifying.

01:19:57.904 --> 01:19:59.153
TALIESIN: I've got an idea.

01:19:59.153 --> 01:20:00.265
ASHLEY: Okay, what's your idea?

01:20:00.265 --> 01:20:03.703
TALIESIN: We're gonna need one of your nightgowns
and some of the pudding from downstairs kitchen.

01:20:03.703 --> 01:20:05.085
(all laugh)

01:20:05.085 --> 01:20:06.218
ASHLEY: Oh okay.

01:20:06.218 --> 01:20:07.185
LIAM: Wow.

01:20:07.185 --> 01:20:10.190
ASHLEY: Okay. Can I go grab one of my-- I'm gonna
go grab one of my nightgowns.

01:20:10.190 --> 01:20:11.140
MATT: Okay.

01:20:11.140 --> 01:20:13.542
TALIESIN: I'm gonna send for some desserts from
downstairs.

01:20:13.542 --> 01:20:14.358
MATT: Okay.

01:20:14.358 --> 01:20:16.151
MARISHA: I had nights like this in college you
guys. This is not cool.

01:20:16.151 --> 01:20:16.957
(all laugh)

01:20:16.957 --> 01:20:17.931
TALIESIN: Oh, I'm well aware.

01:20:17.931 --> 01:20:19.012
MARISHA: This is not cool when you wake up like
this.

01:20:19.012 --> 01:20:22.243
MATT: All right, nightgown retrieved, pudding, a
little stale but retrieved.

01:20:22.243 --> 01:20:23.690
TALIESIN: That's fine, stale is better.

01:20:23.690 --> 01:20:24.442
MATT: Yeah.

01:20:24.442 --> 01:20:25.826
ASHLEY: Is my nightgown a little big on him?

01:20:25.826 --> 01:20:28.041
(all laugh)

01:20:28.041 --> 01:20:30.621
MATT: Actually yeah. You're a little thicker than
Scanlan. Got some--

01:20:30.621 --> 01:20:32.109
ASHLEY and LAURA: Ayyy!

01:20:32.109 --> 01:20:33.509
TRAVIS: She's a monstah.

01:20:33.509 --> 01:20:34.489
ASHLEY: (singing) More to love.

01:20:34.489 --> 01:20:36.758
MATT: Ain't nothing wrong with that. Ain't nothing
wrong with that.

01:20:36.758 --> 01:20:38.405
(all laughing)

01:20:38.405 --> 01:20:40.774
ASHLEY: That's right, I got all the games.

01:20:40.774 --> 01:20:42.318
LIAM: He's like a gnome Steve Buscemi.

01:20:42.318 --> 01:20:43.527
(laughing continues)

01:20:43.527 --> 01:20:45.513
MATT: Essentially, yes.

01:20:45.513 --> 01:20:46.953
TRAVIS: Those pythons, yo.

01:20:46.953 --> 01:20:48.064
MATT: You're the monster.

01:20:48.064 --> 01:20:50.648
All right, so you have the nightgown and 
you have the pudding, what's the plan?

01:20:50.648 --> 01:20:52.056
ASHLEY: What are you thinking?

01:20:52.056 --> 01:20:53.542
TALIESIN: Well, first we're going to have to strip
him

01:20:53.542 --> 01:20:54.324
ASHLEY: Okay.

01:20:54.324 --> 01:20:55.643
TALIESIN: We're gonna put him in your nightgown.

01:20:55.643 --> 01:20:56.842
ASHLEY: Okay.

01:20:56.842 --> 01:21:00.383
TALIESIN: We're gonna just, sort of leave him
hanging off the bed and decorate the entire room

01:21:00.383 --> 01:21:04.101
with all the desserts we've brought up and just
smear them in interesting patterns and--

01:21:04.101 --> 01:21:05.081
ASHLEY: (gasps)

01:21:05.081 --> 01:21:09.230
TALIESIN: Maybe some Latin everywhere. Just wonder
what happened. Let's just leave him a tableau.

01:21:09.230 --> 01:21:10.083
ASHLEY: We'll have an art party.

01:21:10.083 --> 01:21:14.988
TALIESIN: I think it's a fabulous idea.

01:21:14.988 --> 01:21:17.109
ASHLEY: All right, so I'll start undressing him.

01:21:17.109 --> 01:21:26.396
MATT: All right so Kerr, you watch as Percival and
Pike begin undressing Scanlan's comatose body--

01:21:26.396 --> 01:21:27.417
TRAVIS: In a coma.

01:21:27.417 --> 01:21:28.586
MATT: --and re-dressing it in a nightgown--

01:21:28.586 --> 01:21:29.578
LAURA: Terrible.

01:21:29.578 --> 01:21:35.877
MATT: --and then stage by stage, taking handfuls
of room temperature, probably day-old pudding--

01:21:35.877 --> 01:21:36.874
LAURA: (gasps)

01:21:36.874 --> 01:21:38.874
MATT: --and desserts and smearing them across the
room--

01:21:38.874 --> 01:21:40.142
LAURA, TALIESIN, and MARISHA: Eww.

01:21:40.142 --> 01:21:41.358
MATT: --and Scanlan himself.

01:21:41.358 --> 01:21:42.567
TALIESIN: We're gonna braid his hair as well.

01:21:42.567 --> 01:21:47.950
LAURA: It could be like a week before he wakes up
all moldy and nasty.

01:21:47.950 --> 01:21:52.065
TALIESIN: I'm gonna smear in some of it on his
forehead

01:21:52.065 --> 01:21:55.725
so he can read it in the mirror backwards
and it's just gonna say, 'no, never.'

01:21:55.725 --> 01:21:57.720
(all laugh)

01:21:57.720 --> 01:22:00.566
LIAM: With a quill? (laughing) it's a lot of
letters

01:22:00.566 --> 01:22:02.894
TALIESIN: Gently, gently with your-- you can fit
that.

01:22:02.894 --> 01:22:04.140
MATT: It's a small forehead.

01:22:04.140 --> 01:22:04.916
LIAM: Yeah, sharpies don't exist.

01:22:04.916 --> 01:22:10.483
TALIESIN: Oh, that's true, it is a small head.
Let's do two lines.

01:22:10.483 --> 01:22:13.496
MARISHA: I feel like I want to do "You've got the
nightgown and you've got the pudding.

01:22:13.496 --> 01:22:16.498
"Now what are you gonna do?" 
in cross stitch on my wall.

01:22:16.498 --> 01:22:17.714
LAURA: (laughs)

01:22:17.714 --> 01:22:22.831
MATT: All righty. So, you complete your art
project.

01:22:22.831 --> 01:22:26.544
MATT: Take it however you feel, witnessing the
event Kerrek--

01:22:26.544 --> 01:22:29.861
PATRICK: Actually, Kerr, at some point, is
probably like,

01:22:29.861 --> 01:22:34.879
If you got some ribbons, get his hands.

01:22:34.879 --> 01:22:35.889
TRAVIS: Oh my god.

01:22:35.889 --> 01:22:38.080
(all laugh)

01:22:38.080 --> 01:22:39.047
TRAVIS: I'm shocked.

01:22:39.047 --> 01:22:40.063
PATRICK: On the bedpost.

01:22:40.063 --> 01:22:41.100
TRAVIS: I'm shocked.

01:22:41.100 --> 01:22:43.515
TALIESIN: You, sir, are a man of the world. What a
great idea.

01:22:43.515 --> 01:22:46.204
(all laugh)

01:22:46.204 --> 01:22:48.552
TRAVIS: A man of the world.

01:22:48.552 --> 01:22:51.415
TALIESIN: I'm going to retrieve two of my scarves
from my room.

01:22:51.415 --> 01:22:52.524
(all laugh)

01:22:52.524 --> 01:22:53.704
MATT: Okay.

01:22:53.704 --> 01:22:54.655
LIAM: Yes, yes.

01:22:54.655 --> 01:22:58.147
TALIESIN: With two of-- of the-- uh, yeah.

01:22:58.147 --> 01:23:00.315
MATT: (laughs) That's perfect.

01:23:00.315 --> 01:23:01.700
TALIESIN: Couple of neck scarves.

01:23:01.700 --> 01:23:03.019
MATT: Great, okay.

01:23:03.019 --> 01:23:04.296
PATRICK: Not too tight.

01:23:04.296 --> 01:23:05.046
TALIESIN: Not too tight.

01:23:05.046 --> 01:23:05.656
PATRICK: Not too tight.

01:23:05.656 --> 01:23:06.914
TALIESIN: Gentle. (laughs)

01:23:06.914 --> 01:23:09.539
PATRICK: No, no that's not that sort of knot.

01:23:09.539 --> 01:23:11.011
MATT: (laughs)

01:23:11.011 --> 01:23:17.808
PATRICK: You have to wrap it around and then
through.

01:23:17.808 --> 01:23:21.254
MATT: You unintentionally learn more about
Kerrek's history than you expected to.

01:23:21.254 --> 01:23:24.110
TALIESIN: I really I feel like I'm getting so many
more chapters.

01:23:24.110 --> 01:23:26.442
LIAM: So very Vox Machina.

01:23:26.442 --> 01:23:35.941
MATT: All right, and with the presentation
complete, your diorama con Scanlan, the evening

01:23:35.941 --> 01:23:40.664
draws late. It is now probably a good 2:30, 3
o'clock in the morning upon completion.

01:23:40.664 --> 01:23:41.515
MARISHA: Oh, oh shit.

01:23:41.515 --> 01:23:43.157
TALIESIN: It is time for sleep.

01:23:43.157 --> 01:23:45.198
LAURA: Did I ever get a message?

01:23:45.198 --> 01:23:46.970
MATT: Yeah, we're gonna get to that right now.

01:23:46.970 --> 01:23:52.306
You did get a message from Allura that tells you 
that the ritual is successful. Scanlan is alive.

01:23:52.306 --> 01:23:54.791
LAURA: (excited noise)

01:23:54.791 --> 01:23:55.445
MATT: Yes?

01:23:55.445 --> 01:23:58.989
LAURA: I wake Trinket up. He's alive!

01:23:58.989 --> 01:23:59.962
MATT: (confused bear noises)

01:23:59.962 --> 01:24:01.101
LAURA: He's alive!

01:24:01.101 --> 01:24:02.381
And I go running out of the room.

01:24:02.381 --> 01:24:03.468
He's alive!

01:24:03.468 --> 01:24:05.047
to the entire
bar down below.

01:24:05.047 --> 01:24:05.874
MATT: Trinket rushes out after you.

01:24:05.874 --> 01:24:07.338
"(aggressive bear noises)"

01:24:07.338 --> 01:24:08.181
TRAVIS: (laughs)

01:24:08.181 --> 01:24:11.321
LAURA: It worked! It worked! Who's awake!? Anyone?
Is anyone awake?

01:24:11.321 --> 01:24:16.408
MATT: You-- (laughs) you look down and there's
maybe three people in the open expanse of the

01:24:16.408 --> 01:24:23.681
tavern floor, two of which are passed out on
tables, one of them in their own vomit and there

01:24:23.681 --> 01:24:30.014
is-- the door to the tavern is still open and the
one barkeep is somebody else has taken on the

01:24:30.014 --> 01:24:34.315
night shift, who's currently just sitting back and
reading a book. Just kinda looks up at you,

01:24:34.315 --> 01:24:36.046
"Shhhhh."

01:24:36.046 --> 01:24:37.410
LAURA: You!

01:24:37.410 --> 01:24:38.446
MATT: What?

01:24:38.446 --> 01:24:40.014
LAURA: I'm buying you a drink!

01:24:40.014 --> 01:24:41.212
(all laugh)

01:24:41.212 --> 01:24:43.799
LAURA: I come running downstairs and keep
drinking.

01:24:43.799 --> 01:24:49.128
MATT: Okay, you approach the gentleman, who-- you
know, receding hairline, short, kind of salt and

01:24:49.128 --> 01:24:55.793
pepper hair, bit of a double chin going on. A
portly fella in his probably late forties or so,

01:24:55.793 --> 01:25:00.464
kinda square spectacles at the tip of his nose
with his book he sits down to the side.

01:25:00.464 --> 01:25:05.975
He's wearing just a simple tunic with a little bit
of an apron on.

01:25:05.975 --> 01:25:09.896
"Um, uh (sputtering) sure, I uh, I suppose."

01:25:09.896 --> 01:25:11.067
LAURA: Yeah.

01:25:11.067 --> 01:25:16.994
MATT: Alright, um, I'll pour my drink.

01:25:16.994 --> 01:25:19.912
LAURA: What's the best thing you've got? That's,
you know, within reason?

01:25:19.912 --> 01:25:24.082
(all laugh)

01:25:24.082 --> 01:25:28.003
MATT: "That'll be the Supple Wake, um--"

01:25:28.003 --> 01:25:34.693
And he pulls this dark red, terracotta jug from 
underneath and it has a wax seal on the

01:25:34.693 --> 01:25:38.585
top of it that's kind of currently
closed off and he,

01:25:38.585 --> 01:25:44.353
"This'll run you about uh, 20 gold for
the bottle. It's the best we have."

01:25:44.353 --> 01:25:49.740
LAURA: I'm in! Let's do it! and then pour a bowl
of ale for my bear here.

01:25:49.740 --> 01:25:53.332
MATT: He looks over and he just sees like,
lumbering across the room--

01:25:53.332 --> 01:25:55.728
He didn't notice at the time, just kinda 
transfixed by your sudden strangeness.

01:25:55.728 --> 01:25:57.935
LAURA: Cause he was in my necklace
earlier when I came in.

01:25:57.935 --> 01:25:59.858
MATT: Yeah. Suddenly there's a giant bear
(crashing noises) and he goes,

01:25:59.858 --> 01:26:05.642
"Um... okay. (nervous laughter)" (sound of the
bottle being popped open)

01:26:05.642 --> 01:26:09.459
MATT: And just goes ahead and fills three 
small glasses--

01:26:09.459 --> 01:26:10.736
LIAM: He's on a different layer.

01:26:10.736 --> 01:26:11.548
MATT: --passes them over--

01:26:11.548 --> 01:26:12.900
LIAM: A whole new sound effect.

01:26:12.900 --> 01:26:15.654
MATT: --and puts over into a bowl and kinda sets
it onto the edge and Trinket kinda pulls and grabs

01:26:15.654 --> 01:26:18.058
the edge of the bowl with a big claw and it tips
over and kinda splashes--

01:26:18.058 --> 01:26:19.108
LAURA: Yeah.

01:26:19.108 --> 01:26:20.825
MATT: --and as Trinket's face is (licking noises).

01:26:20.825 --> 01:26:22.937
LAURA: Drink up, buddy. That's some expensive
shit.

01:26:22.937 --> 01:26:26.929
MATT: Gets up on the top. Gets both arms up on the
actual bar and is kinda like crushing the wood a

01:26:26.929 --> 01:26:31.128
little bit and knocked the bowl over and
it's spilled out and he's like (slurping) and the

01:26:31.128 --> 01:26:36.393
guy's just sitting back leaning further and
further away, grabs his glass...

01:26:36.393 --> 01:26:38.109
LAURA: Cheers!

01:26:38.109 --> 01:26:41.009
LAURA: What a great night! Ha! (drinking sound)

01:26:41.009 --> 01:26:42.486
MATT: --to the night shift"

01:26:42.486 --> 01:26:46.982
(all laugh)

01:26:46.982 --> 01:26:50.667
MATT: All right--

01:26:50.667 --> 01:26:53.811
LIAM: We've been playing this game three years.
You wait three years to pull out that brand new

01:26:53.811 --> 01:26:56.399
sound effect of a cork (popping sound) coming out
of a bottle.

01:26:56.399 --> 01:26:57.405
LAURA: I know, right!?

01:26:57.405 --> 01:26:59.093
MATT: I don't know! I spent a lot of time alone as
a kid. (laughs)

01:26:59.093 --> 01:27:01.019
LIAM: Wow, wow.

01:27:01.019 --> 01:27:02.770
MARISHA: We've been playing this game for like
five years.

01:27:02.770 --> 01:27:03.776
LAURA: Yeah, god, five years!

01:27:03.776 --> 01:27:05.323
ASHLEY: Five years.

01:27:05.323 --> 01:27:08.440
MARISHA: This is like two and then-- two and a
half, four and a half, I think.

01:27:08.440 --> 01:27:10.449
LIAM: Yeah, we started back in nineteen aught
five, right?

01:27:10.449 --> 01:27:12.071
TRAVIS and LAURA: (old-timey voices) Nineteen
aught five!

01:27:12.071 --> 01:27:14.977
MARISHA: It was spring break, Cancun.

01:27:14.977 --> 01:27:16.444
MATT: (dudebro voice) Spring break!

01:27:16.513 --> 01:27:18.601
(all laugh)

01:27:18.601 --> 01:27:28.207
MATT: So, evening comes full circle, rest comes
about, the next day, presents you with rest,

01:27:28.207 --> 01:27:39.011
comfort. You're healful, you've restored your hit
points, you get back half of your hit dice. Also,

01:27:39.011 --> 01:27:42.195
bright and early, as you all begin to kinda rouse
from your slumber and wake up, Scanlan still

01:27:42.195 --> 01:27:52.426
asleep, still covered in the mess that you left
him in. And shortly into the morning there is a

01:27:52.426 --> 01:27:58.075
series of quick (pounding sounds) footsteps up
from the lower regions of the castle as Vex'ahlia

01:27:58.075 --> 01:28:02.747
arrives, freshly transported by Eskil Ryndarien to
Whitestone.

01:28:02.747 --> 01:28:04.281
LAURA: (laughs)

01:28:04.281 --> 01:28:08.067
MATT: So as you rush in, you can see everybody
kind of slightly groggily having their breakfast

01:28:08.067 --> 01:28:10.782
in the main eating hall of Whitestone castle.

01:28:10.782 --> 01:28:13.164
LAURA: (gasp) Where is he? Where is he?

01:28:13.164 --> 01:28:14.992
TRAVIS: Oh no, he's still asleep.

01:28:14.992 --> 01:28:17.341
TALIESIN: He's still sleeping it off.

01:28:17.341 --> 01:28:18.380
LAURA: Oh.

01:28:18.380 --> 01:28:20.167
TALIESIN: I don't think he's actually like woken
up yet.

01:28:20.167 --> 01:28:22.517
LAURA: Oh, oh! It takes a lot out of you.

01:28:22.517 --> 01:28:24.123
TALIESIN: It does, yes.

01:28:24.123 --> 01:28:26.328
LAURA: How's everyone? Are you good? How'd it go?

01:28:26.328 --> 01:28:27.766
ASHLEY: Good, good good good good.

01:28:27.766 --> 01:28:28.706
TALIESIN: Good.

01:28:28.706 --> 01:28:30.343
LAURA: (relieved sigh) I was so worried.

01:28:30.343 --> 01:28:31.406
ASHLEY: I'm so glad you're back.

01:28:31.406 --> 01:28:32.317
LAURA: I'm so glad to be here.

01:28:32.317 --> 01:28:34.988
MARISHA: How was your night? Where are-- did you--
how was it? How was that town?

01:28:34.988 --> 01:28:36.529
LAURA: The town.

01:28:36.529 --> 01:28:37.849
MARISHA: Yeah?

01:28:37.849 --> 01:28:39.685
LAURA: You know, I didn't see much of it.

01:28:39.685 --> 01:28:40.312
MARISHA: No?

01:28:40.312 --> 01:28:41.026
LAURA: Outside of a bar.

01:28:41.026 --> 01:28:42.046
MARISHA: Oh, sure, yeah.

01:28:42.046 --> 01:28:45.426
LAURA: Yeah, me and Eskil had some times though, I
can tell you.

01:28:45.426 --> 01:28:48.260
MARISHA: Really!? I never pegged him for like--

01:28:48.260 --> 01:28:49.734
LAURA: That guy is a partier.

01:28:49.734 --> 01:28:51.636
MARISHA: No way! What!?

01:28:51.636 --> 01:28:52.403
LAURA: Oh yeah.

01:28:52.403 --> 01:28:53.406
TALIESIN: Fascinating to know.

01:28:53.406 --> 01:28:54.752
MARISHA: Shut up.

01:28:54.752 --> 01:28:56.557
LAURA: He put some moves on me, Percy. You should
be aware.

01:28:56.557 --> 01:28:57.907
TALIESIN: Really? Really?

01:28:57.907 --> 01:28:58.567
MARISHA: (shocked gasp)

01:28:58.567 --> 01:29:01.589
MATT: At which point, you turn around in the room
and you see Eskil entering

01:29:01.589 --> 01:29:08.451
with his little walking stick like 
(back cracking noises) (old man groan).

01:29:08.451 --> 01:29:14.035
MARISHA: Eskil, you devil. You little pit fiend,
you! Look at you!

01:29:14.035 --> 01:29:16.306
TALIESIN: Such impropriety.

01:29:16.306 --> 01:29:20.046
MATT: I'll take my meal in my room.

01:29:20.046 --> 01:29:21.227
LAURA: Thanks again darling! It was wonderful.

01:29:21.227 --> 01:29:23.078
MARISHA: (whispering) Oh, he's having a hangover
meal.

01:29:23.078 --> 01:29:26.394
TRAVIS: You gave him back problems?

01:29:26.394 --> 01:29:27.894
MATT: "... good day."

01:29:27.894 --> 01:29:29.901
(all laugh)

01:29:29.901 --> 01:29:37.588
MATT: He slowly turns around. "Where is my
manservant?" and he wanders off into the castle.

01:29:37.588 --> 01:29:39.644
LAURA: So what are we doing today?

01:29:39.644 --> 01:29:45.759
MARISHA: (sigh) Well, I guess, I mean we-- I know
Allura's going back to Emon to check in on things

01:29:45.759 --> 01:29:51.612
since we kind of left in a hurry but, I guess we
should wait for Scanlan to wake up.

01:29:51.612 --> 01:29:56.300
TALIESIN: Well... there are things to do I
suppose.

01:29:56.300 --> 01:29:59.132
There's still a list of things that need
to be taken care of.

01:29:59.132 --> 01:30:02.269
TRAVIS: Yeah 
And I suppose we really shouldn't rush Scanlan,

01:30:02.269 --> 01:30:05.216
I mean, we might be able to do some of those.

01:30:05.216 --> 01:30:07.498
ASHLEY: Sleep is the best medicine!

01:30:07.498 --> 01:30:08.790
TRAVIS: It is?

01:30:08.790 --> 01:30:10.668
ASHLEY: Some people say that.

01:30:10.668 --> 01:30:12.984
(all laugh)

01:30:12.984 --> 01:30:19.503
ASHLEY: Although real medicine is a little better 
but just really for rejuvenation and...

01:30:19.658 --> 01:30:21.226
What are we doing?

01:30:21.226 --> 01:30:22.610
(all laugh)

01:30:22.610 --> 01:30:27.379
MATT: Pike, holistic cleric.

01:30:27.379 --> 01:30:30.049
TRAVIS: Pretty much anything is good.

01:30:30.049 --> 01:30:33.142
MATT: Kerrek now wanders in very hungover

01:30:33.142 --> 01:30:35.173
TALIESIN: Good morning.

01:30:35.173 --> 01:30:38.482
PATRICK: Yeah, very... yeah.

01:30:38.482 --> 01:30:39.826
(all laugh)

01:30:39.826 --> 01:30:43.665
I look every bit as old as I am

01:30:43.665 --> 01:30:45.738
TRAVIS: Yeaaah, swamp ass!

01:30:45.738 --> 01:30:46.769
(all laugh)

01:30:46.769 --> 01:30:48.812
ASHLEY: Aaaaay!

01:30:48.812 --> 01:30:53.181
ASHLEY: I remember, I remember it

01:30:53.181 --> 01:30:53.951
LAURA: Swamp ass?

01:30:53.951 --> 01:30:55.580
TALIESIN: I don't remember, what?

01:30:55.580 --> 01:30:57.798
ASHLEY: He was talking about his butt getting
sweaty.

01:30:57.798 --> 01:31:00.583
TALIESIN: Oh... 
Ah, the night got weird.

01:31:00.583 --> 01:31:03.914
ASHLEY: We all agreed it happens!

01:31:03.914 --> 01:31:08.636
LIAM: (clicks tongue) Uh, I'm actually not here.
I never left the temple.

01:31:08.636 --> 01:31:09.606
LAURA: Oh!

01:31:09.606 --> 01:31:10.877
MATT: Stayed there overnight?

01:31:10.877 --> 01:31:13.010
LIAM: Ah, yes I did. And we'll have a flashback
now.

01:31:13.010 --> 01:31:14.114
MATT: Okay!

01:31:14.114 --> 01:31:15.602
LIAM: Super quick! Super quick.

01:31:15.602 --> 01:31:17.882
LAURA and ASHLEY: (make "flashback" sounds)

01:31:17.882 --> 01:31:20.567
MATT: (with a "narrator" voice) Where is Vax?
(whooshing sounds)

01:31:20.567 --> 01:31:28.586
LIAM: Fucking exhausted. Set down everything that
I own on the altar, and took ten minutes to take

01:31:28.586 --> 01:31:32.891
off all the armor and lay that out on the altar
and just, uh--

01:31:32.891 --> 01:31:35.299
LAURA: (unwrapping a candy loudly)

01:31:35.299 --> 01:31:38.093
LIAM: Get your candies unwrapped, grandmas. 
(laughs)

01:31:38.093 --> 01:31:45.645
And I just stare at it. For a long time
wondering,

01:31:45.645 --> 01:31:49.965
What happens now?

01:31:49.965 --> 01:31:53.832
That's it. And then I stay there for the whole
night.

01:31:53.832 --> 01:31:55.799
MATT: Okay. So, as you guys continue breakfast--

01:31:55.799 --> 01:31:58.228
LAURA and LIAM: ("flashback" whooshing sounds)

01:31:58.228 --> 01:32:02.321
MATT: (laughs) Yeah. And you arrive and catch up
with everybody and your brother's not there.

01:32:02.321 --> 01:32:03.918
LAURA: (with her mouth full of candy) Where's
Vax?!

01:32:03.918 --> 01:32:05.069
TRAVIS: Your brother's not here

01:32:05.069 --> 01:32:06.277
LAURA: Where is he?

01:32:06.277 --> 01:32:11.084
ASHLEY: He stayed in the Raven Queen's temple? 
I know that.

01:32:11.084 --> 01:32:12.425
LAURA: He stayed in the temple?!

01:32:12.425 --> 01:32:14.824
ASHLEY: I think he did. I-- I don't know, I was up
in the room that I--

01:32:14.824 --> 01:32:16.190
TRAVIS: That's where we saw him last.

01:32:16.190 --> 01:32:18.839
ASHLEY: He stayed there when we left, so he could
still be there? I'm not sure.

01:32:18.839 --> 01:32:21.953
MARISHA: He didn't come back last night, so... I'm
assuming he stayed there.

01:32:21.953 --> 01:32:24.863
LAURA: Well, I'm, gonna go find him! I give Percy
a kiss on the head as I walk by.

01:32:24.863 --> 01:32:26.534
It's good to see you again.

01:32:26.534 --> 01:32:28.675
TALIESIN: It's good to see you too. Welcome home!

01:32:28.675 --> 01:32:30.444
LAURA: Glad you're alive.

01:32:30.444 --> 01:32:32.295
TALIESIN: (laughs) Very glad to be alive.

01:32:32.295 --> 01:32:34.093
LAURA: Where's my brother?

01:32:34.093 --> 01:32:36.386
(all laugh)

01:32:36.386 --> 01:32:38.281
MARISHA: She's in a really good mood.

01:32:38.281 --> 01:32:40.581
TALIESIN: Yes, she is.

01:32:40.581 --> 01:32:42.986
TRAVIS: Maybe you should hit up Eskil for some
tricks.

01:32:42.986 --> 01:32:44.752
MARISHA: I know!

01:32:44.752 --> 01:32:46.195
TALIESIN: I think that might be fun!

01:32:46.195 --> 01:32:47.628
(all laugh)

01:32:47.628 --> 01:32:52.076
MARISHA: I didn't know you guys had that kind of
relationship.

01:32:52.076 --> 01:32:56.896
TALIESIN: The girth of things you do not know
could fill such a cavern.

01:32:56.896 --> 01:32:58.751
MARISHA: (laughs) You said "girth".

01:32:58.751 --> 01:33:03.867
TALIESIN: I did. Ah, I love you. I'm so proud 
of you.

01:33:03.867 --> 01:33:08.973
MATT: The bad influence of Vox Machina.

01:33:08.973 --> 01:33:10.861
MARISHA: Vex taught me that was funny!

01:33:11.014 --> 01:33:14.808
(all laugh)

01:33:14.808 --> 01:33:17.745
TALIESIN: Wow, thank you, I didn't need that.

01:33:17.745 --> 01:33:25.801
MATT: Vax. After a long night of meditation on
your place between the mortal realm and divine,

01:33:25.801 --> 01:33:33.648
the ramifications or meaning behind the choices in
allowance that destiny still lays unfulfilled, to

01:33:33.648 --> 01:33:42.924
have not felt intervention against the return of
the spirits of those you've lost weighs a bit on

01:33:42.924 --> 01:33:56.829
you. The idea that to not allow a thread to be 
severed means there's still a plan. And that

01:33:56.829 --> 01:34:02.499
worries you. Because that means, in what little 
scope you have, you don't see that there's still

01:34:02.499 --> 01:34:11.502
more work to be done, at least as far as she's 
concerned. As tonight you've had nothing but

01:34:11.502 --> 01:34:19.319
silence within the temple. 
And then (slams) the door slams open, the bright

01:34:19.319 --> 01:34:23.623
light of the morning just (swooshes) across you as
you're on the altar, and there you see,

01:34:23.623 --> 01:34:28.175
silhouetted in the light, the outline of your
sister.

01:34:28.175 --> 01:34:34.976
LAURA: What are you doing!? Trinket, stay outside,
it's holy in here.

01:34:34.976 --> 01:34:37.040
LIAM: Don't come in here, Trinket, I'm naked!

01:34:37.040 --> 01:34:38.383
MATT: (Trinket groans)

01:34:38.383 --> 01:34:42.319
LAURA: Oh. Well. I walk in blindly, one hand in
front of me.

01:34:42.319 --> 01:34:46.274
Are you really naked or are you just
saying that? Where are you?

01:34:46.274 --> 01:34:48.287
LIAM: I stand up and let my dinglies dangle.

01:34:48.287 --> 01:34:49.132
LAURA: No!

01:34:49.132 --> 01:34:50.801
(all laugh)

01:34:50.801 --> 01:34:51.670
LAURA: Hey!

01:34:51.670 --> 01:34:53.133
LIAM: Yeah?

01:34:53.133 --> 01:34:55.502
LAURA: I heard he's alive!

01:34:55.502 --> 01:34:56.183
LIAM: Yeah.

01:34:56.183 --> 01:34:59.385
LAURA: That's pretty great, right?

01:34:59.385 --> 01:35:02.001
I turn my back to him so I can open my damn eyes.

01:35:02.001 --> 01:35:03.189
MATT: Okay.

01:35:03.189 --> 01:35:04.843
LAURA: What are you doing sleeping in here?!

01:35:04.843 --> 01:35:06.137
LIAM: I give her a naked hug from behind.

01:35:06.137 --> 01:35:09.940
LAURA: Ahh, creepy! Get off! Fucking gross!

01:35:09.940 --> 01:35:12.464
LIAM: (laughs) Oh, we used to take baths together.

01:35:12.464 --> 01:35:16.834
(all laugh)

01:35:16.834 --> 01:35:18.877
LIAM: What? What's that funny?

01:35:18.877 --> 01:35:22.164
LAURA: Nothing! Nothing!

01:35:22.164 --> 01:35:23.484
LIAM: Ah, he is, he is.

01:35:23.484 --> 01:35:26.310
And I back off.

01:35:26.310 --> 01:35:27.634
He's good.

01:35:27.634 --> 01:35:30.323
LAURA: (still laughing) Yeah...

01:35:30.323 --> 01:35:32.502
LIAM: You missed quite a performance, actually.

01:35:32.502 --> 01:35:35.129
LAURA: Oh, really? By whom?

01:35:35.129 --> 01:35:40.004
LIAM: The younger Shorthalt.

01:35:40.004 --> 01:35:43.061
LAURA: So she did contribute.

01:35:43.061 --> 01:35:46.175
LIAM: Oh, yes.

01:35:46.175 --> 01:35:49.291
LAURA: Thank God that trip wasn't
for nothing.

01:35:49.291 --> 01:35:55.744
LIAM: I start to put on my sort of Mormon unibody
underwear thing.

01:35:55.744 --> 01:36:00.467
Uh. So that's done, then.

01:36:00.467 --> 01:36:02.030
LAURA: What's done? What?

01:36:02.030 --> 01:36:04.127
LIAM: Dragons!

01:36:04.127 --> 01:36:07.330
LAURA: I mean... Can I turn around?

01:36:07.330 --> 01:36:09.636
LIAM: Uh... Yeah, I've covered.

01:36:09.636 --> 01:36:10.764
LAURA: Okay.

01:36:10.764 --> 01:36:11.929
LIAM: The glory.

01:36:11.929 --> 01:36:14.748
(both laugh)

01:36:14.748 --> 01:36:17.509
LAURA: I mean, I think so? Right?

01:36:17.509 --> 01:36:18.382
LIAM: Yeah.

01:36:18.382 --> 01:36:22.440
LAURA: I don't know what she was up to, but--
What were you doing here! Why are you sleeping in

01:36:22.440 --> 01:36:27.126
this cold, creepy temple when everyone else 
is celebrating?

01:36:27.126 --> 01:36:29.843
LIAM: You encouraged me to embrace all this when I
was complaining about--

01:36:29.843 --> 01:36:33.844
LAURA: Oh, well, yes, of course. Not to the
detriment of your happiness.

01:36:33.844 --> 01:36:38.293
LIAM: (laughs) I'm happy. Ish.

01:36:38.293 --> 01:36:41.599
LAURA: Ish?

01:36:41.599 --> 01:36:44.516
LIAM: What happens now?

01:36:44.516 --> 01:36:52.054
LAURA: Now that dragons are defeated and all of
Tal'Dorei can live in peace and harmony and Vox

01:36:52.054 --> 01:36:56.496
Machina, the heroes that everyone was searching
for...

01:36:56.496 --> 01:36:59.334
LIAM: (laughs) You're staying here?

01:36:59.334 --> 01:37:03.296
LAURA: Staying where? Here? Here in this temple?
Here in Whitestone? I know what you're talking

01:37:03.296 --> 01:37:07.361
about. I mean, I do have a keep here. Right, a
castle? A home.

01:37:07.361 --> 01:37:09.855
LIAM: A husk.

01:37:09.855 --> 01:37:11.317
LAURA: I also have money.

01:37:11.317 --> 01:37:12.016
LIAM: Yeah.

01:37:12.016 --> 01:37:20.246
LAURA: I can build. What're you gonna do? 
Would you stay?

01:37:20.246 --> 01:37:22.035
LIAM: Here?

01:37:22.035 --> 01:37:25.670
LAURA: You have a temple!

01:37:25.670 --> 01:37:31.541
LIAM: I know. I like it! I slept in it.

01:37:31.541 --> 01:37:32.418
(both laugh)

01:37:32.418 --> 01:37:34.998
LAURA: You know, I can get some lush pillows put
in here as well.

01:37:34.998 --> 01:37:39.754
This is on my property after all! (laughs)

01:37:39.754 --> 01:37:48.404
LIAM: No, I was thinking... I mean, I don't know what 
any of us are doing, but I was thinking that I might

01:37:48.404 --> 01:37:55.062
go back with Keyleth. For a while.

01:37:55.062 --> 01:38:00.227
LAURA: Right! Well, of course!

01:38:00.227 --> 01:38:06.380
LIAM: I mean, you're set, you're-- This is your
home, now

01:38:06.380 --> 01:38:11.247
LAURA: I mean, one of--

01:38:11.247 --> 01:38:22.783
LIAM: I don't mean the place, or the building...
You know what I mean.

01:38:22.783 --> 01:38:29.388
LAURA: I mean, it's-- Hasn't been very long,
dear, who knows what's gonna happen?

01:38:29.388 --> 01:38:30.526
LIAM: Sure.

01:38:30.526 --> 01:38:31.485
LAURA: Sure?

01:38:31.485 --> 01:38:33.276
LIAM: Sure.

01:38:33.276 --> 01:38:36.394
LAURA: Would you like me to travel with you and
Keyleth?

01:38:36.394 --> 01:38:44.202
LIAM: I would never turn you away. But I think 
that you have activities to explore here...

01:38:44.202 --> 01:38:50.906
But no, I mean, you're my heart, you're me, you're
my other half, you're welcome with me always.

01:38:50.906 --> 01:38:54.478
LAURA: (distressed) Why are we talking about
this!? Don't talk about this now!

01:38:54.478 --> 01:39:06.359
This is a time of happiness, don't talk about 
sad things! Please... Please?

01:39:06.359 --> 01:39:07.077
LIAM: I am happy.

01:39:07.077 --> 01:39:08.687
LAURA: Good!

01:39:08.687 --> 01:39:11.766
LIAM: Happiest I've been in a long time. Long
time.

01:39:11.766 --> 01:39:14.134
LAURA: Good. Come.

01:39:14.134 --> 01:39:14.785
LIAM: Yeah!

01:39:14.785 --> 01:39:15.563
LAURA: All right!

01:39:15.563 --> 01:39:17.462
LIAM: Well, you know, I'm in my undies, so...

01:39:17.462 --> 01:39:18.552
LAURA: Well! Put your armor on--

01:39:18.552 --> 01:39:21.089
LIAM: Why don't you go and I'll catch up-- That
takes like 22 minutes, though!

01:39:21.089 --> 01:39:22.556
LAURA: Well, what if I help you!

01:39:22.556 --> 01:39:24.196
LIAM: All right.

01:39:24.196 --> 01:39:24.947
LAURA: Done it before.

01:39:24.947 --> 01:39:25.643
LIAM: Yeah

01:39:25.643 --> 01:39:28.119
LAURA: Ten minutes, then, right? Go get some breakfast, after all.

01:39:28.119 --> 01:39:32.499
LIAM: Yeah.

01:39:32.499 --> 01:39:33.844
MARISHA: Dress sequence!

01:39:33.844 --> 01:39:34.882
TALIESIN: And that's how you put on armor.

01:39:34.882 --> 01:39:37.247
(all laugh)

01:39:37.247 --> 01:39:42.189
MATT: Alright. As you guys head back, you all
gather at this point in time.

01:39:42.189 --> 01:39:46.960
Allura and Kima have woken and met up with you, 
begin to make arrangements and telling you to

01:39:46.960 --> 01:39:54.354
gather your things if you're going to journey with 
them to Emon to find your way there.

01:39:54.354 --> 01:39:57.592
You guys have everything you need?

01:39:57.592 --> 01:40:04.104
TRAVIS: Uh, yes.

01:40:04.104 --> 01:40:06.373
LAURA: I mean we're all healed, everything's
great?

01:40:06.373 --> 01:40:08.183
MATT: Yeah, you all had a night's rest.

01:40:08.183 --> 01:40:10.788
LAURA: What are we gonna do, we're bringing 
Scanlan with us?

01:40:10.788 --> 01:40:11.495
LIAM: No.

01:40:11.495 --> 01:40:12.618
TRAVIS: No, no, no.

01:40:12.618 --> 01:40:13.383
LAURA: Scanlan's gonna stay here?

01:40:13.383 --> 01:40:14.074
TRAVIS: Yes!

01:40:14.074 --> 01:40:14.725
LAURA: Alone?

01:40:14.725 --> 01:40:15.647
TRAVIS: Yes!

01:40:15.647 --> 01:40:17.370
TALIESIN: He's got nurses.

01:40:17.370 --> 01:40:23.465
MATT: &nbsp;Well, not alone, we can have Keeper Yennen
watch over him, we have a number of guard

01:40:23.465 --> 01:40:31.554
here, and soon as any word comes to his rousing we
will make sure that it's sent to us.

01:40:31.554 --> 01:40:33.592
LIAM: Pike, how's he looking?

01:40:33.592 --> 01:40:37.700
PATRICK: Someone should probably roll him over and
change his knots (snickers).

01:40:37.700 --> 01:40:40.558
LAURA: Oh that's true. I mean I wasn't there, I
don't know what the fuck you're talking about.

01:40:40.558 --> 01:40:43.639
(all laugh)

01:40:43.639 --> 01:40:44.890
LAURA: What knots?

01:40:44.890 --> 01:40:48.215
TALIESIN: The nurses were given some instructions.

01:40:48.215 --> 01:40:52.216
PATRICK: Actually he's just nodding, just laughing
to himself, he just can't talk about anything.

01:40:52.216 --> 01:40:55.793
MATT: As his laughter begins to build, a second
set of laughter gets to join in,

01:40:55.793 --> 01:41:05.927
as you see coming around the corner, laughing a
still drunk, not slept, Kaylie...

01:41:05.927 --> 01:41:06.897
MARISHA: Oh shit.

01:41:06.897 --> 01:41:10.021
MATT: --comes with circles in her eyes, just goes,

01:41:10.021 --> 01:41:13.748
"Heh, well, that there's some fancy work, whoever
did that".

01:41:13.748 --> 01:41:16.850
TRAVIS: Oh shit, she saw the room.

01:41:16.850 --> 01:41:21.766
MATT: That's choice! (laughs)

01:41:21.766 --> 01:41:24.252
TALIESIN: You're welcome, dear. Seemed the least
we could do.

01:41:24.252 --> 01:41:28.055
ASHLEY: Figured it was appropriate when he woke
up, that he would--

01:41:28.055 --> 01:41:29.501
LAURA: What did you do?

01:41:29.501 --> 01:41:31.349
ASHLEY: Not anything--

01:41:31.349 --> 01:41:35.716
MATT: Knot, exactly! Knot! A few knots.

01:41:35.716 --> 01:41:38.821
PATRICK: I think we should, those arms will be 
asleep,

01:41:38.821 --> 01:41:40.718
there's gonna be a problem up there if we don't--

01:41:40.718 --> 01:41:46.442
(all laugh)

01:41:46.442 --> 01:41:48.438
MATT: You know what, I'll stay here, I'll watch
over him,

01:41:48.438 --> 01:41:55.132
I'll make sure the knots are changed in
time. I kinda wanna be here to see his face.

01:41:55.132 --> 01:41:57.949
LIAM: Did he break a leg or something?

01:41:57.949 --> 01:42:01.885
ASHLEY: No, he just-- we wanted to make sure he
stayed-- that he didn't--

01:42:01.885 --> 01:42:02.905
MATT: Comfortable!

01:42:02.905 --> 01:42:04.267
ASHLEY: --didn't roll off the bed.

01:42:04.267 --> 01:42:05.588
MATT: Make sure he stays comfortable.

01:42:05.588 --> 01:42:06.844
ASHLEY: Keep him there.

01:42:06.844 --> 01:42:07.748
LIAM: All right.

01:42:07.748 --> 01:42:09.493
LAURA: All right.

01:42:09.493 --> 01:42:10.661
LIAM: (whispers) I feel like we're missing
something.

01:42:10.661 --> 01:42:12.673
TALIESIN: Keeping him in the manner in which he is
comfortable. (laughs)

01:42:12.673 --> 01:42:14.506
ASHLEY: Yes.

01:42:14.506 --> 01:42:15.963
LAURA: How are you doing, Kaylie?

01:42:15.963 --> 01:42:17.000
MATT: I'm fine.

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:18.153
LAURA: You look great.

01:42:18.153 --> 01:42:20.952
MATT: "I'm sure I do."

01:42:20.952 --> 01:42:27.567
Her hair is kind of all clustered to one side 
now, and you can see the stains on her shirt,

01:42:27.567 --> 01:42:32.507
but she still looks like she could probably take 
somebody in a bar-fight. You can definitely see

01:42:32.507 --> 01:42:39.380
in this moment more than anything,
she is of Shorthalt stock.

01:42:39.380 --> 01:42:42.636
"Well, go on! Do your thing."

01:42:42.636 --> 01:42:46.207
TRAVIS: You're sure? You'll be all right here? I'm
sure Percy can let you have whatever you

01:42:46.207 --> 01:42:49.068
want, right, Percy? Just anything she wants.

01:42:49.068 --> 01:42:51.051
TALIESIN: No. But if you do need a room--

01:42:51.051 --> 01:42:52.306
(all laugh)

01:42:52.306 --> 01:42:57.473
TALIESIN: --and some drink, we definitely have
that available. And the appropriate authorities

01:42:57.473 --> 01:43:03.780
have already been-- why are you all
looking at me like that?

01:43:03.780 --> 01:43:07.961
TRAVIS: Do I need to remind you of the title you
gave me? Surely I hold some power in--

01:43:07.961 --> 01:43:09.481
TALIESIN: It does.

01:43:09.481 --> 01:43:11.318
MARISHA: Ooh, yeah, ooh, I wrote that title down.

01:43:11.318 --> 01:43:13.054
LIAM: Yes, of all of this and that? The Doinka
Doink?

01:43:13.054 --> 01:43:15.036
MARISHA: Grand Poobah?

01:43:15.036 --> 01:43:18.370
TRAVIS: It doesn't really matter, I'm just saying,
if she needs something while we're gone--

01:43:18.370 --> 01:43:20.013
MARISHA: This is very important--

01:43:20.013 --> 01:43:22.700
TALIESIN: Don't hesitate to ask if you do need
anything.

01:43:22.700 --> 01:43:25.368
TRAVIS: Uh-huh. I have decreed it.

01:43:25.368 --> 01:43:29.432
MATT: Well, I shall certainly ask. And I will
need everything.

01:43:29.432 --> 01:43:32.589
TALIESIN: I am powerfully aware.

01:43:32.589 --> 01:43:34.897
MATT: Kind of rushes past you and sits down and
starts eating

01:43:34.897 --> 01:43:37.203
the leftovers of whatever dish was
not finished.

01:43:37.203 --> 01:43:40.487
MARISHA: Grand Poobah de Boink is the title.

01:43:40.552 --> 01:43:42.222
LIAM: Of all this and that.

01:43:42.222 --> 01:43:43.056
MARISHA: I wrote it down.

01:43:43.056 --> 01:43:44.235
LAURA: Of all this and that.

01:43:44.235 --> 01:43:47.619
MARISHA: Of all, yes, "In Charge of All Of This
And That".

01:43:47.619 --> 01:43:50.540
TRAVIS: That was the proper title.

01:43:50.540 --> 01:43:51.665
(all laugh)

01:43:51.665 --> 01:43:58.293
MATT: &nbsp;I need to add that to the Campaign Guide. I
need to do that.

01:43:58.293 --> 01:44:00.172
ASHLEY: Grand, what is it? Grand Poobah..?

01:44:00.172 --> 01:44:01.598
TALIESIN: Poobah!

01:44:01.598 --> 01:44:02.311
MARISHA: de Boink.

01:44:02.311 --> 01:44:03.311
TALIESIN: de Boink.

01:44:03.311 --> 01:44:04.048
MATT: de Boink.

01:44:04.048 --> 01:44:06.116
MARISHA: Like Des Moines, but de Boink.

01:44:06.116 --> 01:44:07.444
LIAM: Of the Vermont de Boinks?

01:44:07.444 --> 01:44:09.128
MARISHA: Of the Vermont de Boinks.

01:44:09.128 --> 01:44:11.302
TALIESIN: Steady are the winds caused by the farts
of kings.

01:44:11.302 --> 01:44:13.922
(all laugh)

01:44:13.922 --> 01:44:15.014
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:44:15.014 --> 01:44:16.239
ASHLEY: That is adorable.

01:44:16.239 --> 01:44:16.989
TALIESIN: Indeed.

01:44:16.989 --> 01:44:18.073
MATT: "All right."

01:44:18.073 --> 01:44:23.115
She finishes eating. Allura is watching this whole
thing in the distance with her arms crossed.

01:44:23.115 --> 01:44:27.032
"Whenever you're ready, shall we?"

01:44:27.032 --> 01:44:28.643
TALIESIN: Yeah.

01:44:28.643 --> 01:44:29.588
LAURA: All right.

01:44:29.588 --> 01:44:30.763
TRAVIS: Ready.

01:44:30.763 --> 01:44:32.289
TALIESIN: (whispers) We'll be back.

01:44:32.289 --> 01:44:39.496
MATT: "Now, please, hands together."

01:44:39.496 --> 01:44:43.039
And there's a rush of cold wind (whooshing 
sound) which takes up suddenly the familiar

01:44:43.039 --> 01:44:49.861
sensation of teleportation as you're all thrust 
back into the outside of the Cloudtop District,

01:44:49.861 --> 01:44:56.862
exterior of the gates. You can see there's still 
smoke rising up, but as opposed to the clouds

01:44:56.862 --> 01:45:01.703
of billowing cinders and flame, it appears that 
most buildings in the immediate vicinity,

01:45:01.703 --> 01:45:07.597
while black and darkened and broken, no longer 
rage of burning fire. The smoke has gone from

01:45:07.597 --> 01:45:14.418
pitch-black to bits of dark grey and plumes 
of white. You can see already there is a bustle

01:45:14.418 --> 01:45:19.511
throughout the city as a number of bodies are 
laid out across the ground with bits of gathered

01:45:19.511 --> 01:45:26.020
cloth placed over them, those who had fallen in 
the battle and are being gathered,

01:45:26.020 --> 01:45:30.811
being prepared to be brought back 
to their families.

01:45:30.811 --> 01:45:33.691
MARISHA: I immediately look to the sky.

01:45:33.691 --> 01:45:37.255
Do I see any sign of the Ashari, and what 
do the clouds look like?

01:45:37.255 --> 01:45:40.522
MATT: The sky is a clear cloudless crystalline
blue.

01:45:40.522 --> 01:45:41.443
MARISHA: Really?

01:45:41.443 --> 01:45:42.495
MATT: Yes.

01:45:42.495 --> 01:45:46.197
MARISHA: Okay. No sign of Ashari?

01:45:46.197 --> 01:45:53.845
MATT: No, it's been, it's been a day and a half or
so since the battle happened. There is no

01:45:53.845 --> 01:46:01.969
current clouds or storm in the sky. But as you do
appear, you see there are a number of soldiers in

01:46:01.969 --> 01:46:10.925
patchwork armor, some that appeared to be in
similar outfits as the Fort Daxio soldiers that

01:46:10.925 --> 01:46:17.518
you met there during the pre-battle circumstance.
There are few that you recognize as Syngornian

01:46:17.518 --> 01:46:23.230
armor, and a few that are just people gathered
what they could and have been part of the fray and

01:46:23.230 --> 01:46:32.591
the recovery process. You can see, in all
the turmoil and darkness and the destruction

01:46:32.591 --> 01:46:37.625
you've seen in this city, it's strangely beautiful
and welcoming to see that there is life thriving

01:46:37.625 --> 01:46:43.304
again as people are returning, doors are being
pushed back upon the frames, people are searching

01:46:43.304 --> 01:46:47.122
for survivors behind the rubble and the various
homes, and finding them. And you're seeing

01:46:47.122 --> 01:46:53.536
families that are stepping out and being reunited
as you begin to walk through the street. You can

01:46:53.536 --> 01:47:02.514
see, essentially, the hidden heartbeat of the city
is re-emerging once more to take back what it's

01:47:02.514 --> 01:47:12.349
lost. All of you are caught speechless for
a few moments and you take in this vision,

01:47:12.349 --> 01:47:17.438
and begin to walk as Allura kind of leads you,
looking around and walks on and talks to a few

01:47:17.438 --> 01:47:26.749
guards. She glances back to you and kind of
smiles.

01:47:26.749 --> 01:47:34.259
"Well, you've done it."

01:47:34.259 --> 01:47:38.760
And you hear a voice behind her, a kind of echoing
shout.

01:47:38.760 --> 01:47:42.537
"Kerrek!"

01:47:42.537 --> 01:47:48.774
And you watch a familiar female face come rushing
up in clanking armor (clanking noises), and she

01:47:48.774 --> 01:47:53.738
rushes up and just socks you across the face.
Whack!

01:47:53.738 --> 01:47:54.832
PATRICK: This is Samantha?

01:47:54.832 --> 01:47:55.777
MATT: This is Samantha.

01:47:55.777 --> 01:47:56.392
(all laugh)

01:47:56.392 --> 01:47:57.855
PATRICK: Okay.

01:47:57.855 --> 01:48:00.779
MATT: Where'd you go?

01:48:00.779 --> 01:48:01.586
PATRICK: What?

01:48:01.586 --> 01:48:06.438
MATT: What'd you do?

01:48:06.438 --> 01:48:09.201
PATRICK: What did I do?

01:48:09.201 --> 01:48:11.226
LAURA: That man's a hero.

01:48:11.226 --> 01:48:13.020
MARISHA: He slayed a dragon.

01:48:13.020 --> 01:48:13.668
MATT: (laughs)

01:48:13.668 --> 01:48:14.669
LAURA: A giant one.

01:48:14.669 --> 01:48:15.573
MARISHA: The big green one.

01:48:15.573 --> 01:48:17.027
MATT: You've been gone for two days.

01:48:17.027 --> 01:48:17.929
LAURA: Killing a dragon.

01:48:17.929 --> 01:48:21.524
PATRICK: I told you I might be gone for a while.
Is everything okay?

01:48:21.524 --> 01:48:24.961
MATT: Everything's fine, we're ready to go!

01:48:24.961 --> 01:48:31.820
PATRICK: Good. Good. Good.

01:48:31.820 --> 01:48:42.184
TRAVIS: You're leaving? Where are you
going?

01:48:42.184 --> 01:48:53.130
PATRICK: Back where we came from. I've got a
town to continue looking after. And now I know

01:48:53.130 --> 01:49:05.406
that any work I put into it would probably have
time to become something worthwhile.

01:49:05.406 --> 01:49:10.248
TRAVIS: Yeah, plus you got all that money you took
from down in the dragon's lair, so that helps.

01:49:10.248 --> 01:49:11.586
LAURA: Shh, Grog.

01:49:11.586 --> 01:49:14.367
PATRICK: A lot of money.

01:49:14.367 --> 01:49:18.135
LIAM: Hey, make sure your people know.

01:49:18.135 --> 01:49:24.365
That man played the final note in the song 
of the Conclave of Dragons.

01:49:24.365 --> 01:49:26.592
MARISHA: It's true.

01:49:26.592 --> 01:49:27.789
TALIESIN: So I'm told.

01:49:27.789 --> 01:49:28.828
MATT: Kerr?

01:49:28.828 --> 01:49:29.716
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:49:29.716 --> 01:49:30.448
LIAM: That's right.

01:49:30.448 --> 01:49:31.241
LAURA: Yeah.

01:49:31.241 --> 01:49:32.913
MARISHA: He's a badass.

01:49:32.913 --> 01:49:34.477
TRAVIS: His hammer glows.

01:49:34.477 --> 01:49:36.422
LAURA: Well it did until it was destroyed by the
dragon.

01:49:36.422 --> 01:49:38.527
MATT: She looks down at her fist.

01:49:38.527 --> 01:49:41.655
"I just punched a badass."

01:49:41.655 --> 01:49:46.239
PATRICK: I'm like, my lip is split, blood out of
my nose, I'm like

01:49:46.239 --> 01:49:49.624
"Yeah, that's-- what you got
there is now a holy relic."

01:49:49.624 --> 01:49:52.879
(all laugh)

01:49:52.879 --> 01:49:57.287
MATT: She pats you in the arm (clanging noise),
then a clang in her armor against yours.

01:49:57.287 --> 01:49:59.915
"Well, good. Glad to see you back in action.

01:49:59.915 --> 01:50:04.234
"Glad to see you fighting, kicking ass, 
killing dragons."

01:50:04.234 --> 01:50:09.700
PATRICK: Yeah, uh, are folks ready to troop out?

01:50:09.700 --> 01:50:12.319
MATT: And you see her now, her expression goes
from kind of

01:50:12.319 --> 01:50:16.330
joyous excitement to see him return
to a somber tone.

01:50:16.330 --> 01:50:20.816
"Yes, um, we have the bodies on carts and 
the rest

01:50:20.816 --> 01:50:24.458
"of us are ready to make the trek back to Westruun."

01:50:24.458 --> 01:50:31.835
PATRICK: Okay. Thanks. I'll be along
straight away. I should say my goodbyes.

01:50:31.835 --> 01:50:39.318
MATT: All right, well, about three blocks down 
that way, turn to the right, second square.

01:50:39.318 --> 01:50:40.260
PATRICK: Okay.

01:50:40.260 --> 01:50:43.159
MATT: She turns around and makes her way off and,
looking over her shoulder,

01:50:43.159 --> 01:50:46.871
kind of grinning a little bit. Looks at 
her fist again, looks back,

01:50:46.871 --> 01:50:48.782
shakes her head, and just keeps walking.

01:50:48.782 --> 01:50:57.189
TRAVIS: (mournfully) Bye, Sam.

01:50:57.189 --> 01:51:15.565
PATRICK: I can't thank you all enough.
And I need you to look after each other.

01:51:15.565 --> 01:51:23.353
Because I will not be here to do it.

01:51:23.353 --> 01:51:28.089
LAURA: You're a good man, Kerr.

01:51:28.089 --> 01:51:36.822
PATRICK: Uh, we do our best.

01:51:36.822 --> 01:51:45.643
PATRICK: He just stands there awkwardly for 
a moment and then turns around and walks away.

01:51:45.643 --> 01:51:51.457
LAURA: Awww.

01:51:51.457 --> 01:51:52.595
ASHLEY: Awww.

01:51:52.595 --> 01:51:54.891
MARISHA: Kerr!

01:51:54.891 --> 01:51:57.832
PATRICK: Turns around.

01:51:57.832 --> 01:52:03.836
MARISHA: Vox Machina was better to have you.

01:52:03.836 --> 01:52:07.365
PATRICK: Well, you know where I am.

01:52:07.365 --> 01:52:11.449
MARISHA: And you know where to find us.

01:52:11.449 --> 01:52:19.525
PATRICK: I'll let you know if we need ya. And
really, really keep an eye on the knots.

01:52:19.525 --> 01:52:21.911
It's-- no
more than four hours.

01:52:21.911 --> 01:52:28.290
(all laugh)

01:52:28.290 --> 01:52:31.937
PATRICK: And then I walk off into the sunset.

01:52:31.937 --> 01:52:34.595
LAURA: Ahhhh.

01:52:34.595 --> 01:52:42.094
MATT: As you watch Kerr slowly walk down the
street, looking back, making his way to this

01:52:42.094 --> 01:52:48.344
current chapter of his re-adventuring, to gather
those he brought up here willing to die for the

01:52:48.344 --> 01:52:54.958
battle that you finished, we're going to take a
break.

01:52:54.958 --> 01:52:57.586
MATT: We'll be back here in a minute. Patrick
Rothfuss, thank you so much for joining us.

01:52:57.586 --> 01:52:58.388
TRAVIS: Patrick!

01:52:58.388 --> 01:52:59.127
LAURA: Patrick!

01:52:59.127 --> 01:53:00.775
(applause)

01:53:00.775 --> 01:53:08.287
PATRICK: Guys, thank you, thank you so much. It
was such a treat. I did not plan on being up in

01:53:08.287 --> 01:53:14.920
your business for so long, but I'm so, so happy 
to be a part of this, for this piece of the story.

01:53:14.920 --> 01:53:16.701
I'm so flattered that you had me.

01:53:16.701 --> 01:53:18.221
LIAM: Oh man, mutual, mutual.

01:53:18.221 --> 01:53:19.144
MATT: Definitely.

01:53:19.144 --> 01:53:19.849
LAURA: Yeah.

01:53:19.849 --> 01:53:21.917
MARISHA: There's a green dragon waiting for you.

01:53:21.917 --> 01:53:22.925
PATRICK: Woo hoo!

01:53:22.925 --> 01:53:24.009
LAURA: In your bedroom.

01:53:24.009 --> 01:53:26.642
MARISHA: He's in my house and you have to fight me
to get it, so...

01:53:26.642 --> 01:53:27.595
MATT: (laughs)

01:53:27.595 --> 01:53:29.097
PATRICK: Okay, that's a deal.

01:53:29.097 --> 01:53:32.667
MARISHA: But it's technically yours whenever you
come for it.

01:53:32.667 --> 01:53:35.780
LIAM: Three weeks from now, the door opens.
(explosion sound)

01:53:35.780 --> 01:53:40.837
MARISHA: Oh, shit! That's fair.

01:53:40.837 --> 01:53:45.075
MATT: Thank you so much, Patrick. Guys, we'll take
a break.

01:53:45.075 --> 01:53:47.442
We have a giveaway, actually, 'cause we
didn't get a break last week.

01:53:47.442 --> 01:53:52.049
We have a big Wormwood giveaway to do here 
at the end of the break, with a big old cluster.

01:53:52.049 --> 01:53:55.333
So, pay attention to the chat room. They'll
have all the information for you on how to get and

01:53:55.333 --> 01:53:58.460
be a part of that. And we'll see you here in a few
minutes.

01:53:58.460 --> 01:54:01.127
(all cheer)

01:54:01.127 --> 02:09:22.081
[BREAK]

02:09:22.233 --> 02:09:24.035
MATT: Welcome back to Critical Role.

02:09:24.035 --> 02:09:25.069
(everyone laughs)

02:09:25.069 --> 02:09:27.464
MATT: Apparently, we had a penguin
explode in the background.

02:09:27.464 --> 02:09:29.375
LAURA: That sounded
like Dolores Umbridge.

02:09:29.375 --> 02:09:30.481
TRAVIS: Did Foster just shart?

02:09:30.481 --> 02:09:31.900
TALIESIN: It was like a goose.

02:09:31.900 --> 02:09:36.661
TRAVIS: What was it? Who sneezed?

02:09:36.661 --> 02:09:37.900
LAURA: Eddie! (laughs)

02:09:37.900 --> 02:09:40.809
LIAM: --specifically thinking, let me give Matt a
little break here. I'll give him a little time.

02:09:40.809 --> 02:09:42.912
And then (makes loud sound).

02:09:42.912 --> 02:09:47.326
MATT: There's no break. I get an
instinctual nervousness now right before we go

02:09:47.326 --> 02:09:51.934
live because of you assholes now. Like this kind
of Pavlovian, kind of (nervously) okay.

02:09:51.934 --> 02:09:53.888
TRAVIS: It's like somebody sniped a parakeet. That
was crazy.

02:09:53.888 --> 02:09:55.042
(loud high tooting sound)

02:09:55.042 --> 02:09:56.188
MATT: There it was.

02:09:56.188 --> 02:09:56.843
LAURA: There it is.

02:09:56.843 --> 02:09:57.456
MATT: Second time.

02:09:57.456 --> 02:09:58.518
TRAVIS: Is that a sneeze or is he fucking with us?

02:09:58.518 --> 02:09:59.118
MATT: I don't know.

02:09:59.118 --> 02:10:00.198
LIAM: (mobster voice) It would be a shame if
something

02:10:00.198 --> 02:10:01.561
should happen to your piece of mind
before a D&amp;amp;D game.

02:10:01.561 --> 02:10:03.889
MATT: Yeah, I know. Just keep rolling your dice.

02:10:03.889 --> 02:10:05.908
LIAM: (dying noise)

02:10:05.908 --> 02:10:11.316
MATT: All right, anyway. Welcome back, guys. So
the winner of the contest in the chat room is

02:10:11.316 --> 02:10:15.090
kalagrace. K-A-L-A-G-R-A-C-E. Congratulations!

02:10:15.090 --> 02:10:16.222
(all cheer)

02:10:16.222 --> 02:10:19.115
MATT: You're going to win a bunch of stuff.

02:10:19.115 --> 02:10:20.186
MARISHA: You got stuff!

02:10:20.186 --> 02:10:21.672
MATT: They haven't told me. From Wyrmwood.

02:10:21.672 --> 02:10:22.654
LAURA: What stuff, though?

02:10:22.654 --> 02:10:24.255
MATT: Cool stuff, apparently.

02:10:24.255 --> 02:10:25.913
TRAVIS: Pantomime it.

02:10:25.913 --> 02:10:27.914
MATT: There's stuff here in a big stack this big.

02:10:27.914 --> 02:10:28.733
LAURA: This kind of stuff?

02:10:28.733 --> 02:10:29.680
MATT: That kind of stuff.

02:10:29.680 --> 02:10:31.076
MARISHA: I imagine it's wood, and it's box-shaped.

02:10:31.076 --> 02:10:35.790
MATT: But you won it, and it's going to be really
cool, so congratulations kalagrace.

02:10:35.790 --> 02:10:36.852
LAURA: You just wait.

02:10:36.852 --> 02:10:37.842
MATT: Boom!

02:10:37.842 --> 02:10:39.682
TALIESIN: You just wait.

02:10:39.682 --> 02:10:44.464
MATT: (laughs) All right, so back into the game.

02:10:44.464 --> 02:10:52.402
After you watched Kerrek walk away, the city
itself is getting its bearings. People are

02:10:52.402 --> 02:11:01.986
returning to the recovery process, post-Conclave.
Emon's rebuilding and restructuring.

02:11:01.986 --> 02:11:03.725
What do you guys want to do?

02:11:03.725 --> 02:11:05.736
LAURA: (sighs)

02:11:05.736 --> 02:11:07.928
MATT: Did you retrieve your items, by the way,
from the ritual?

02:11:07.928 --> 02:11:09.965
TRAVIS: Yes, I did want to grab them from the
temple.

02:11:09.965 --> 02:11:12.904
MATT: Okay, yeah. I assumed post-ritual you
weren't going to

02:11:12.904 --> 02:11:15.503
just leave your favorite
artifacts on the altar.

02:11:15.503 --> 02:11:18.469
TRAVIS: No! I got them.

02:11:18.469 --> 02:11:22.060
TALIESIN: And I flipped the Dragonslayer Longsword
for the Gloves of Missile Snaring.

02:11:22.060 --> 02:11:23.528
That was the last thing I did.

02:11:23.528 --> 02:11:28.566
MATT: Traded it out? Okay. Cool. What else would
you guys like to do? What's your plan?

02:11:28.566 --> 02:11:33.029
TRAVIS: We do have a grocery list of things that
we could pick from, right?

02:11:33.029 --> 02:11:35.337
LAURA: We have a lot of stuff we need to do.

02:11:35.337 --> 02:11:37.327
MARISHA: A ton of stuff we need to do.

02:11:37.327 --> 02:11:39.759
TRAVIS: Do we want to make good on that promise
real fast, or what?

02:11:39.759 --> 02:11:40.723
MARISHA: Which one?

02:11:40.723 --> 02:11:42.370
MARISHA: The eighth one we have?

02:11:42.370 --> 02:11:44.297
TRAVIS: The thing under the tree?

02:11:44.297 --> 02:11:46.760
LAURA: That's in Vasselheim.

02:11:46.760 --> 02:11:48.445
LAURA: We also have a hand to deliver to Marquet.

02:11:48.445 --> 02:11:53.177
MARISHA: And a rakshasa to kill.

02:11:53.177 --> 02:11:56.138
TRAVIS: Hey, let's hold off on that one, I think.

02:11:56.138 --> 02:12:01.346
MARISHA: Maybe we should start with checking in
with home? Seeing how the keep is?

02:12:01.346 --> 02:12:02.817
We haven't been home in a long time.

02:12:02.817 --> 02:12:03.778
TRAVIS: Oh, Greyskull?

02:12:03.778 --> 02:12:05.228
LAURA: We were just there.

02:12:05.228 --> 02:12:07.858
MARISHA: I guess we were just there in passing.

02:12:07.858 --> 02:12:14.865
TRAVIS: We're all sore, right? We could knock the
dust off a little bit if we just did a little

02:12:14.865 --> 02:12:18.402
delivery, like some final remains into a tree, or
a hand, or whatever.

02:12:18.402 --> 02:12:21.534
LIAM: We just ended a threat to civilization.

02:12:21.534 --> 02:12:24.582
I don't feel like diving into the Nine Hells, 
at the moment.

02:12:24.582 --> 02:12:25.195
MARISHA: No.

02:12:25.195 --> 02:12:26.155
LAURA: Yeah, not so much.

02:12:26.155 --> 02:12:27.117
TALIESIN: No, not really.

02:12:27.117 --> 02:12:28.432
MARISHA: I'm tired.

02:12:28.432 --> 02:12:29.850
TRAVIS: Where is the hand going, again?

02:12:29.850 --> 02:12:32.165
LAURA AND MARISHA: Marquet.

02:12:32.165 --> 02:12:33.266
TRAVIS: Why?

02:12:33.266 --> 02:12:35.807
LAURA: Because we told them we would give them a
hand.

02:12:35.807 --> 02:12:42.553
TRAVIS: Who did we promise that to?

02:12:42.553 --> 02:12:48.039
LAURA: You know, the thieves'
guild thing. The group of assassins.

02:12:48.039 --> 02:12:51.174
TRAVIS: That's boring. Let's go to Vasselheim.

02:12:51.174 --> 02:12:52.734
MARISHA: Right now?

02:12:52.734 --> 02:12:58.064
LAURA: Shouldn't we help with making sure the
Council is in place? Is everything solid here?

02:12:58.064 --> 02:13:03.183
MATT: You've been gone for a couple of days, and
it's been moving. You could ask around if you want

02:13:03.183 --> 02:13:07.279
to try and get some information about the current
circumstance.

02:13:07.279 --> 02:13:08.775
TRAVIS: I guess we could do that.

02:13:08.775 --> 02:13:09.998
LAURA: Just to make sure.

02:13:09.998 --> 02:13:14.592
MARISHA: Maybe we should also check in with some
of our other keep members,

02:13:14.592 --> 02:13:16.753
and see who's alive and
who's dead?

02:13:16.753 --> 02:13:19.620
MATT: The people of your keep you brought to
Whitestone with you. They've been there.

02:13:19.620 --> 02:13:21.608
MARISHA: Oh, that's right. I totally--

02:13:21.608 --> 02:13:23.136
MATT: It's been a while. It's been a year.

02:13:23.136 --> 02:13:24.058
MARISHA: That's right.

02:13:24.058 --> 02:13:26.953
LAURA: How is Jarett? Was he fine when we got back
to Whitestone?

02:13:26.953 --> 02:13:28.562
MATT: Jarett is recovering.

02:13:28.562 --> 02:13:29.587
LAURA: Okay.

02:13:29.587 --> 02:13:31.751
MARISHA: Did he come back with us, or is he still
in Whitestone?

02:13:31.751 --> 02:13:32.945
MATT: Jarett's still in Whitestone.

02:13:32.945 --> 02:13:34.988
LAURA: He's like, "Fuck you!"

02:13:34.988 --> 02:13:41.877
MATT: Jarett's proud and excited about the things
you've accomplished, but Jarett needs a vacation.

02:13:41.877 --> 02:13:43.482
LIAM: He's got to find some drugs, too.

02:13:43.482 --> 02:13:45.244
MATT: Yeah.

02:13:45.244 --> 02:13:48.124
MATT: He's not happy about that.

02:13:48.124 --> 02:13:49.378
TRAVIS: Modify Memory.

02:13:49.378 --> 02:14:00.100
MATT: (laughs) If you want to roll an
investigation check, Vex.

02:14:00.100 --> 02:14:01.101
LAURA: 19.

02:14:01.101 --> 02:14:01.894
MATT: Okay.

02:14:01.894 --> 02:14:03.116
LAURA: N-n-n-n-nineteen.

02:14:03.116 --> 02:14:06.588
MATT: Spending the next hour or so asking around
from various people, you don't come across any

02:14:06.588 --> 02:14:16.236
notable allies that you recognize, but the word is
that the remaining bulk of the standing army of

02:14:16.236 --> 02:14:22.634
Emon and Fort Daxio, combined with the remnants of
Syngorn's army-- half went back to Syngorn, just

02:14:22.634 --> 02:14:28.984
in case, and the other half remained to help with
the relief effort here-- as well as The Clasp.

02:14:28.984 --> 02:14:32.072
The Clasp is now bringing people they'd been 
keeping underground

02:14:32.072 --> 02:14:34.993
and hidden back to their homes, back
to their locations.

02:14:34.993 --> 02:14:39.776
It seems that the structure, for now, is focused
on the relief effort

02:14:39.776 --> 02:14:42.833
and the returning of the city
to its people.

02:14:42.833 --> 02:14:47.208
As far as the actual Council structure, you don't 
hear anything yet, on that point.

02:14:47.208 --> 02:14:48.402
LAURA: Okay.

02:14:48.402 --> 02:14:50.740
MATT: To be fair, half of the Council was at
Whitestone,

02:14:50.740 --> 02:14:56.812
and you haven't heard from any of the people that 
you knew on the Council who came as

02:14:56.812 --> 02:15:04.751
part of the battle yet. What do you guys want to
do?

02:15:04.751 --> 02:15:08.021
TRAVIS: We don't need to check in with The Clasp,
do we, or anything?

02:15:08.021 --> 02:15:09.368
TALIESIN: (groans)

02:15:09.368 --> 02:15:12.378
LAURA: No. They kind of have their shit that
they're doing.

02:15:12.378 --> 02:15:14.787
MARISHA: We're fine, right?

02:15:14.787 --> 02:15:16.206
LAURA: We're solid.

02:15:16.206 --> 02:15:18.770
LIAM: I'm just going to throw this out: if we
leave things as they are,

02:15:18.770 --> 02:15:23.681
The Clasp are going to
completely ruin the city.

02:15:23.681 --> 02:15:27.092
At some point soon, we might want to get 
some of the Council back here faster.

02:15:27.092 --> 02:15:28.782
LAURA: Well, Allura's here.

02:15:28.782 --> 02:15:31.018
LIAM: That's one, yeah.

02:15:31.018 --> 02:15:33.293
TRAVIS: Do we know where everyone else is?

02:15:33.293 --> 02:15:34.275
LIAM: Whitestone.

02:15:34.275 --> 02:15:41.038
LAURA: Well, the problem is, Uriel was killed when
the dragons attacked.

02:15:41.038 --> 02:15:43.357
Nothing else was ever set in
place after that.

02:15:43.357 --> 02:15:44.821
MARISHA: That's true. Who was acting as--

02:15:44.821 --> 02:15:45.864
LAURA: Thordak.

02:15:45.864 --> 02:15:54.347
MATT: Well, when Sovereign was slain, part of his
instruction was to hand power entirely over to the

02:15:54.347 --> 02:16:04.741
Council. So we are still the power structure of
the city. It's more of a localized republic. We

02:16:04.741 --> 02:16:09.621
need to enforce that structure. While you take to
what business you need, I'm going to try the best

02:16:09.621 --> 02:16:17.842
I can to amass the remaining members of that
Council and install some sort of political

02:16:17.842 --> 02:16:23.585
structure here, now. Partly for the reason you
mentioned,

02:16:23.585 --> 02:16:29.627
and partly because we don't want the
military suddenly running the show, either.

02:16:29.627 --> 02:16:37.152
MARISHA: So as a quick recap, he stepped down and
gave this whole speech that he sees the flaws in

02:16:37.152 --> 02:16:39.882
one ruler, and wants to hand it over to a council
rule--

02:16:39.882 --> 02:16:42.886
MATT: Yeah. He didn't want to be a tyrant with
advisors.

02:16:42.886 --> 02:16:46.262
He wanted to have a council that best
represented the people's interests in power.

02:16:46.262 --> 02:16:51.449
MARISHA: Right. He essentially switched it from a
monarchy to a republic.

02:16:51.449 --> 02:16:52.321
MATT: Essentially, yeah.

02:16:52.321 --> 02:16:53.222
MARISHA: Okay.

02:16:53.222 --> 02:16:55.748
TALIEISN: And we have the rest of the royal family
in Whitestone.

02:16:55.748 --> 02:16:59.278
MATT: Yes. Salda and the children are currently
there.

02:16:59.278 --> 02:17:05.051
We've kept them safe, and Salda will most
likely be placed on the Council, as she has quite

02:17:05.051 --> 02:17:13.871
a bit of knowledge and experience, and to keep the
memory. If we can recover his body or some

02:17:13.871 --> 02:17:22.740
semblance of it, I will also see that there is a
monument built to the memory of the Sovereign.

02:17:22.740 --> 02:17:24.670
TRAVIS: Yep.

02:17:24.670 --> 02:17:27.854
LIAM: And you think you've got a handle on getting
a foothold here?

02:17:27.854 --> 02:17:34.570
MATT: I think if I can find one or two of my
friends, definitely.

02:17:34.570 --> 02:17:38.398
MARISHA: Do you need help in finding your friends?

02:17:38.398 --> 02:17:42.984
MATT: Your strengths are best tended to
elsewhere.

02:17:42.984 --> 02:17:44.201
MARISHA: Okay.

02:17:44.201 --> 02:17:49.034
MATT: Don't worry. I know Mikhail is around, and
me and him have a good rapport, and he has the

02:17:49.034 --> 02:17:55.769
military at his back, so if anything goes south or
wrong, I know how to let you know. So much as you

02:17:55.769 --> 02:17:59.829
stay on this realm. Don't go vanishing to other
planes without letting me know, please.

02:17:59.829 --> 02:18:00.828
LAURA: No Feywild?

02:18:00.828 --> 02:18:02.347
MATT: Please. No.

02:18:02.347 --> 02:18:03.675
TALIESIN: Not for a bit.

02:18:03.675 --> 02:18:06.044
LAURA: Not for a bit. Allura, before we leave.

02:18:06.044 --> 02:18:06.920
MATT: Yes?

02:18:06.920 --> 02:18:08.969
LAURA: Will you take a look?

02:18:08.969 --> 02:18:12.541
I hand her the box of ashes that Senokir gave us.

02:18:12.541 --> 02:18:18.166
Do you sense any kind of aura coming off of this, 
or do you think it is what he said:

02:18:18.166 --> 02:18:22.550
just a box of his wife's
ashes?

02:18:22.550 --> 02:18:28.012
MATT: She takes the dark box, and it has small
chained edges on each end.

02:18:28.012 --> 02:18:32.589
She inspects it for a moment.

02:18:32.589 --> 02:18:38.102
"The box does have a very faint magical
essence to it, but it appears to be purely

02:18:38.102 --> 02:18:44.507
"protective. I'm not entirely certain of anything
beyond that. It's very faint."

02:18:44.507 --> 02:18:47.181
LAURA: Okay. Thank you.

02:18:47.181 --> 02:18:48.865
MARISHA: Kima's with us, right?

02:18:48.865 --> 02:18:54.564
MATT: Kima's in the process of going around and
gathering information and checking in.

02:18:54.564 --> 02:18:57.479
MARISHA: I grab Vax and Vex really quick, and I
say,

02:18:57.479 --> 02:19:02.703
Hey. You guys are really good at asking
people back for the stuff that we lent them.

02:19:02.703 --> 02:19:08.801
I feel a little rude doing that, but you guys are
good at that. So--

02:19:08.801 --> 02:19:10.229
LAURA: Oh! Kima?

02:19:10.229 --> 02:19:11.072
MARISHA: The boots.

02:19:11.072 --> 02:19:12.330
LAURA: Hey, those boots?

02:19:12.330 --> 02:19:13.805
MARISHA: See? You guys are good at it.

02:19:13.805 --> 02:19:14.739
MATT: What?

02:19:14.739 --> 02:19:17.077
LIAM: Hey, you know those boots you hate wearing?

02:19:17.077 --> 02:19:18.755
MATT: Oh, they're fantastic. I love them.

02:19:18.755 --> 02:19:19.685
LIAM: Oh, shit.

02:19:19.685 --> 02:19:21.676
(all laugh)

02:19:21.676 --> 02:19:26.290
LAURA: It's unfortunate that they look a little
iffy with your armor, though.

02:19:26.290 --> 02:19:28.856
Just kind of-- can
we have them back, please?

02:19:28.856 --> 02:19:31.017
LIAM: Yeah.

02:19:31.017 --> 02:19:34.972
LAURA: We might be sneaking around, you know, in
life or death situations,

02:19:34.972 --> 02:19:36.850
and you're going to be
here with the Council.

02:19:36.850 --> 02:19:41.549
MARISHA: Pike is very clanky. No offense, Pike.

02:19:41.549 --> 02:19:44.856
ASHLEY: No, none taken.

02:19:44.856 --> 02:19:49.460
LIAM: You look like a badass gladiator in Yuletide
socks.

02:19:49.460 --> 02:19:53.013
MATT: She holds her Holy Avenger out in front of
her and checks its blade.

02:19:53.013 --> 02:19:54.076
LAURA: We did give you that.

02:19:54.076 --> 02:19:57.743
MARISHA: You can keep it.

02:19:57.743 --> 02:20:05.077
MATT: (metal scraping noise) "Fine!" She bends
down, and kind of... (grunt of effort).

02:20:05.077 --> 02:20:08.909
LIAM, LAURA, and ASHLEY: Eyyy.

02:20:08.909 --> 02:20:10.004
TRAVIS: Kima!

02:20:10.004 --> 02:20:11.012
LAURA: Those are for you, man!

02:20:11.012 --> 02:20:11.932
ASHLEY: Those are mine?

02:20:11.932 --> 02:20:16.208
MATT: She's now barefoot in full armor. Kind of
wiggles her toes and goes--

02:20:16.208 --> 02:20:18.529
ASHLEY: I can give her the shoes that I was
wearing!

02:20:18.529 --> 02:20:20.844
LAURA: No, cause you have the Sprinter's Boots on.

02:20:20.844 --> 02:20:21.575
ASHLEY: What are they?

02:20:21.575 --> 02:20:22.536
LAURA: You got the Sprinter's Boots on.

02:20:22.536 --> 02:20:23.435
ASHLEY: What's she giving me?

02:20:23.435 --> 02:20:24.793
LAURA: She's giving you the Elven Boots.

02:20:24.793 --> 02:20:25.973
MARISHA: They're like stealthy boots.

02:20:25.973 --> 02:20:27.414
LAURA: They're stealth boots! They make you
silent!

02:20:27.414 --> 02:20:28.383
ASHLEY: Oh, shit!

02:20:28.383 --> 02:20:30.895
MARISHA: They're silent! And you don't have to
attune to them!

02:20:30.895 --> 02:20:32.631
ASHLEY: Thanks for giving those back.

02:20:32.631 --> 02:20:34.707
(all laugh)

02:20:34.707 --> 02:20:36.781
ASHLEY: We need 'em.

02:20:36.781 --> 02:20:39.015
TRAVIS: She's staring at you.

02:20:39.015 --> 02:20:40.464
ASHLEY: I-- You're great.

02:20:40.464 --> 02:20:42.418
(all laugh)

02:20:42.418 --> 02:20:43.864
MATT: She actually laughs back at you and says,

02:20:43.864 --> 02:20:47.017
"I know."

02:20:47.017 --> 02:20:50.258
LAURA: Kima, seriously though. You are great.

02:20:50.258 --> 02:20:56.290
MATT: And you know, she's been kind of a ball of
intensity in all of this and she's had frustrating

02:20:56.290 --> 02:21:01.459
moment in combat and she's had earnest fear and
she's had her own journey with you guys from the

02:21:01.459 --> 02:21:04.104
beginning when crossing your paths. She walks up,
and--

02:21:04.104 --> 02:21:07.740
MARISHA: Look, we smoothed it over. We're cool
now.

02:21:07.740 --> 02:21:09.844
(laughter)

02:21:09.844 --> 02:21:14.162
TRAVIS: In between salsa and chips there. Killer.

02:21:14.162 --> 02:21:18.497
MATT: Kima walks up and places her hand on Pike's
shoulder,

02:21:18.497 --> 02:21:27.005
a little bit shorter than her, and looks
at the rest of you,

02:21:27.005 --> 02:21:33.929
"You've done more than anyone ever asked you 
to do. Done a lot of good things.

02:21:33.929 --> 02:21:43.982
"For me, for Allie. For everyone. I know I can be 
a pain in the ass sometimes.

02:21:43.982 --> 02:21:48.520
"I know I get a
little hot-headed."

02:21:48.520 --> 02:21:51.113
LAURA: Lies! Lies.

02:21:51.113 --> 02:22:01.240
MATT: But I just-- thank you for letting me come
along.

02:22:01.240 --> 02:22:05.331
TRAVIS: Yeah. Thanks for kicking ass with us.

02:22:05.331 --> 02:22:07.873
MATT: We're not done yet!

02:22:07.873 --> 02:22:09.293
LAURA: We're not?

02:22:09.293 --> 02:22:10.899
MATT: (laughs) 'course not!

02:22:10.899 --> 02:22:13.594
What, you think one of these Clasp bastards 
won't start wandering the town?

02:22:13.594 --> 02:22:16.854
TRAVIS: Whew! Thank goodness.

02:22:16.854 --> 02:22:19.560
MATT: Now, if you guys end up actually going back
to Vasselheim,

02:22:19.560 --> 02:22:26.891
and Mr. Vord starts coming around, asking 
questions... tell him you haven't seen me.

02:22:26.891 --> 02:22:29.521
LAURA: (laughs) You got it.

02:22:29.521 --> 02:22:31.034
TRAVIS: Lie?

02:22:31.034 --> 02:22:35.172
MATT: No, no! Just tell him you haven't seen me.

02:22:35.172 --> 02:22:36.951
TRAVIS: Well, I have seen you.

02:22:36.951 --> 02:22:40.639
MATT: Tell him you haven't.

02:22:40.639 --> 02:22:50.399
(all laugh)

02:22:50.399 --> 02:22:56.420
MARISHA: You are the cutest thing sometimes!

02:22:56.420 --> 02:23:01.014
LIAM: He's like the chihuahua with the bulging
eyes!

02:23:01.014 --> 02:23:07.846
MATT: Kima just goes-- Kima walks past Pike and
goes up and pats you on the chest.

02:23:07.846 --> 02:23:12.520
"It's okay, Big Man. Forget I said anything."

02:23:12.520 --> 02:23:13.704
Then turns back you
guys and goes,

02:23:13.704 --> 02:23:16.167
"I'm sorry! I didn't know!"

02:23:16.167 --> 02:23:18.108
ASHLEY: We'll say the words.

02:23:18.108 --> 02:23:19.814
LIAM: Oh my gosh.

02:23:19.814 --> 02:23:24.903
MATT: "All right, all right. Well, stay safe.

02:23:24.903 --> 02:23:30.098
And if you need someone's skull cracked in, 
you know where to find me."

02:23:30.098 --> 02:23:33.641
She turns back and runs after
Allura, who's currently walking off to go ahead

02:23:33.641 --> 02:23:38.647
and find the rest of her connections in the city.
What do you guys want to do?

02:23:38.647 --> 02:23:41.317
LIAM: It was like he polymorphed into something!

02:23:41.317 --> 02:23:44.924
TRAVIS: (silly noise)

02:23:44.924 --> 02:23:46.905
ASHLEY: That face will be burned into my brain.

02:23:46.905 --> 02:23:49.644
(all laugh)

02:23:49.644 --> 02:23:53.168
TALIESIN: Don't talk to me. Sorry.

02:23:53.226 --> 02:23:54.630
ASHLEY: Okay.

02:23:54.630 --> 02:23:56.414
LAURA: Shit!

02:23:56.414 --> 02:23:58.512
TRAVIS: What easy thing can we accomplish?

02:23:58.512 --> 02:24:00.259
TALIESIN: I say we go to Vasselheim.

02:24:00.259 --> 02:24:02.445
MARISHA: Well, wait, aren't we going to check in
with our keep?

02:24:02.445 --> 02:24:04.019
LAURA: Yeah! Let's walk to our keep and bamf out
there.

02:24:04.019 --> 02:24:05.162
TALIESIN: We'll walk to our keep--

02:24:05.162 --> 02:24:07.955
MARISHA: If anything, that means we came to Emon
for nothing--

02:24:07.955 --> 02:24:08.925
LAURA: Yeah, pretty much.

02:24:08.925 --> 02:24:09.948
MARISHA: --except to go to our Keep.

02:24:09.948 --> 02:24:11.254
TALIESIN: We made a double-check.

02:24:11.254 --> 02:24:13.079
LAURA: Yeah! We had to make sure everything was
alright here.

02:24:13.079 --> 02:24:14.049
TALISIN: It was a free ride.

02:24:14.049 --> 02:24:14.900
MARISHA: That's true.

02:24:14.900 --> 02:24:16.036
TRAVIS: Cool! To the keep.

02:24:16.036 --> 02:24:19.975
MARISHA: And as I'm walking through, I keep an eye
out to see if there are any Ashari lingering

02:24:19.975 --> 02:24:23.594
around but I'm sure they've all bounced at this
point.

02:24:23.594 --> 02:24:25.625
MATT: Okay. Make a perception check.

02:24:25.625 --> 02:24:32.138
MARISHA: Alright. I'm gonna use my druid die. 
Oh, okay. Just straight perception?

02:24:32.138 --> 02:24:32.622
MATT: Yup.

02:24:32.622 --> 02:24:33.617
MARISHA: 26.

02:24:33.617 --> 02:24:39.662
MATT: Okay. As you guys continue your way through
the city, and you keep an eye out, you don't see

02:24:39.662 --> 02:24:48.956
anybody with an Ashari dress. You do see a handful
of occasional bodies in Ashari dress.

02:24:48.956 --> 02:24:50.252
MARISHA: Sure.

02:24:50.252 --> 02:24:55.897
MATT: And you very carefully go and inspect, and
while you recognise a handful,

02:24:55.897 --> 02:24:59.279
you didn't know
them extremely well.

02:24:59.279 --> 02:25:00.974
MARISHA: Yeah, I've been gone awhile.

02:25:00.974 --> 02:25:05.011
MATT: Older folks you didn't connect with. But
thankfully not Korren.

02:25:05.011 --> 02:25:09.721
MARISHA: Okay

02:25:09.721 --> 02:25:13.895
MATT: But yeah there is no walking presence here
of the Ashari.

02:25:13.895 --> 02:25:17.844
You ask around a bit and one of the
guards is like,

02:25:17.844 --> 02:25:22.224
"Supposed to be coming back here in a few days to
gather the dead but they went ahead and chased the

02:25:22.224 --> 02:25:27.392
"rest of them wyvern riders up to the mountains.
Think they're still at the Storm Crest."

02:25:27.392 --> 02:25:29.031
MARISHA: So the Storm Crest.

02:25:29.031 --> 02:25:30.190
MATT: Probably.

02:25:30.190 --> 02:25:31.614
MARISHA: Still fighting?

02:25:31.614 --> 02:25:35.015
MATT: Well at least picking off what they can.

02:25:35.015 --> 02:25:37.791
MARISHA: All right, thank you.

02:25:37.791 --> 02:25:40.120
MARISHA: If you see any of them,

02:25:40.120 --> 02:25:47.848
just let them know that Vox Machina passed 
through here and that we're all still alive.

02:25:47.848 --> 02:25:50.224
MATT: "Will do."

02:25:50.224 --> 02:25:51.402
And keeps on walking

02:25:51.402 --> 02:25:57.289
MARISHA: Any bodies that I pass by that are Ashari,
I druidcraft little flowers and do

02:25:57.289 --> 02:26:01.066
my own little rituals as I walk by.

02:26:01.066 --> 02:26:09.030
MATT: Okay. You guys make your way through Emon,
eventually the southern walls to the outside of

02:26:09.030 --> 02:26:17.072
Greyskull Keep there standing still proud,
undamaged in the fray, still holding the fresh

02:26:17.072 --> 02:26:24.107
stonework crafted by your planar ally that you
summoned quite some time ago

02:26:24.107 --> 02:26:28.479
LAURA: You got a-- remember a servant of Sarenrae
came down and helped us rebuild

02:26:28.479 --> 02:26:30.384
MATT: Yeah after the Vorugal fight that
destroyed--

02:26:30.384 --> 02:26:31.540
ASHLEY: Oh, that's right.

02:26:31.540 --> 02:26:40.244
MATT: -- the temple. But yeah, the keep is, 
currently the front gates are open.

02:26:40.244 --> 02:26:47.720
As you walk in it looks like since you were
last there there have been a few people that have

02:26:47.720 --> 02:26:51.404
come through and looked for things.

02:26:51.404 --> 02:26:55.716
Doesn't look like it were raided by thieves by any
means, but it looks like anything that was left in

02:26:55.716 --> 02:26:59.574
the kitchen has been ransacked. Looks like tables
and chairs and some bedrooms have been moved,

02:26:59.574 --> 02:27:07.574
whether they briefly held up refugees from
the city who have then gone back in, or people that

02:27:07.574 --> 02:27:11.741
just moseyed through and left, but the place is
still currently empty.

02:27:11.741 --> 02:27:15.056
LAURA: Eventually we do have to hire some people
again.

02:27:15.056 --> 02:27:19.972
MARISHA: Yeah, get this place lively again.

02:27:19.972 --> 02:27:24.265
TRAVIS: I think it looks nice. I mean, it's kind 
of like a lived-in look.

02:27:24.265 --> 02:27:25.116
ASHLEY: Rustic?

02:27:25.116 --> 02:27:26.839
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:27:26.839 --> 02:27:29.105
LAURA: Minimalistic now.

02:27:29.105 --> 02:27:31.253
MARISHA: Hire people.

02:27:31.253 --> 02:27:33.904
LIAM: We can start to look for new hands yeah.

02:27:33.904 --> 02:27:40.402
MARISHA: I go through and use my Gust cantrip and 
dust off some shelves

02:27:40.402 --> 02:27:42.530
and straighten some paintings.

02:27:42.530 --> 02:27:44.527
MATT: (fwoosh) There's a lot of dust.

02:27:44.527 --> 02:27:47.642
LAURA: I wonder if we should offer this up to the
city to the council to house some refugees that

02:27:47.642 --> 02:27:52.386
haven't found homes again, after they've
been destroyed.

02:27:52.386 --> 02:27:53.362
MARISHA: I'm fine with that.

02:27:53.362 --> 02:27:55.409
TALIESIN: Not a terrible idea at all.

02:27:55.409 --> 02:27:57.910
MARISHA: It's not like we're gonna be using it any
time soon.

02:27:57.910 --> 02:27:58.934
LAURA: Right.

02:27:58.934 --> 02:28:00.124
ASHLEY: It's a great idea.

02:28:00.124 --> 02:28:02.331
TRAVIS: We do tend to wander.

02:28:02.331 --> 02:28:06.989
TALIESIN: We'll need to install the teleportation
circle at some point, perhaps.

02:28:06.989 --> 02:28:10.133
LAURA: Should I run back and tell Allura that
before we head out?

02:28:10.133 --> 02:28:13.063
MARISHA: Yeah, let me check on the garden, too.
Pike, do you want to join me?

02:28:13.063 --> 02:28:13.978
ASHLEY: Yes.

02:28:13.978 --> 02:28:15.997
LAURA: I'll head off on the broom and try to find
Allura.

02:28:15.997 --> 02:28:19.941
MATT: Yup. It'll take you couple hours to get 
there and hunt her down

02:28:19.941 --> 02:28:22.243
but you do so and let her know.

02:28:22.243 --> 02:28:24.845
ASHLEY: Go look at the garden and temple.

02:28:24.845 --> 02:28:27.105
MARISHA: How's it looking?

02:28:27.105 --> 02:28:31.035
MATT: The blessings placed upon it and the
position of sunlight,

02:28:31.035 --> 02:28:35.493
a little overgrown, but flourishing.

02:28:35.493 --> 02:28:37.939
MARISHA: Wow, overgrown's better than dead.

02:28:37.939 --> 02:28:39.746
MATT: Yeah.

02:28:39.746 --> 02:28:40.679
MARISHA: All right cool.

02:28:40.679 --> 02:28:42.234
ASHLEY: I like it a little overgrown.

02:28:42.234 --> 02:28:43.791
MARISHA: It's nice, it's kinda rustic.

02:28:43.791 --> 02:28:44.559
MATT: (laughs)

02:28:44.559 --> 02:28:46.578
TALIESIN: Seems to be the word of the day.

02:28:46.644 --> 02:28:48.732
(all laugh)

02:28:48.732 --> 02:28:50.595
TRAVIS: Can I go down to Percy's room?

02:28:50.595 --> 02:28:51.666
MATT: Mm-hm, the workshop?

02:28:51.666 --> 02:28:54.261
TRAVIS: Yeah, the workshop. Is the door closed?

02:28:54.261 --> 02:28:55.438
MATT: It is partially ajar.

02:28:55.438 --> 02:28:56.224
TRAVIS: (gasps)

02:28:56.224 --> 02:28:57.363
MATT: It is dark inside there--

02:28:57.363 --> 02:28:59.717
TRAVIS: Fucking sweet. I go in.

02:28:59.717 --> 02:29:02.384
(all laugh)

02:29:02.384 --> 02:29:04.418
TRAVIS: Is there any light inside?

02:29:04.418 --> 02:29:07.544
MATT: There are a couple of small oil lamps that
are hanging from the walls.

02:29:07.544 --> 02:29:12.333
They are not currently lit, and the forge is dark,
cold there-- most of the tools have already

02:29:12.333 --> 02:29:18.547
been stolen or taken, anything that can be 
grabbed by hand is gone.

02:29:18.547 --> 02:29:22.230
TRAVIS: Are there any of those dangerous buckets
of water around?

02:29:22.230 --> 02:29:27.886
MATT: There are a couple, and it smells
of stale hard water.

02:29:27.886 --> 02:29:29.263
TRAVIS: Treacherous.

02:29:29.263 --> 02:29:33.759
(all laugh)

02:29:33.759 --> 02:29:40.855
TRAVIS: Don't really know what I'm looking for.
Are there any like powders? Like sacks of powder--

02:29:40.855 --> 02:29:42.365
MATT: Make an investigation check.

02:29:42.365 --> 02:29:49.570
TRAVIS: --crates of powder, or-- Oh,
that's not terrible! 14.

02:29:49.570 --> 02:29:59.196
MATT: You do find what looks to be a small
brown wooden barrel-type container. It has a lid on

02:29:59.249 --> 02:30:03.977
it, but it's easy to pull off. And on the inside it
has a familiar smell that you catch whenever

02:30:03.977 --> 02:30:11.839
you see Percy fiddling with his weapons, sort of a
dark powder substance.

02:30:11.839 --> 02:30:13.561
TRAVIS: Can I pour a little out?

02:30:13.561 --> 02:30:20.596
MATT: Yup. Looks like soot or charcoal
dust, grainy like sand.

02:30:20.596 --> 02:30:24.820
LIAM: Can I have snuck down and be watching this?

02:30:24.820 --> 02:30:28.003
MATT: Make a perception check.

02:30:28.003 --> 02:30:31.856
LIAM: That's pretty high, that is a
30.

02:30:31.856 --> 02:30:36.398
MATT: Yeah, you totally saw Grog just stomp down
into the lower area so you can go ahead and...

02:30:36.398 --> 02:30:38.366
LIAM: Thanks.

02:30:38.366 --> 02:30:44.662
TRAVIS: Hm, no fire, dangerous water, no
weapons?

02:30:44.662 --> 02:30:46.874
(all laugh)

02:30:46.874 --> 02:30:49.541
MATT: Does not appear to be any weapons in the
room.

02:30:49.541 --> 02:30:53.179
There are the racks where tools are usually
hung on that you remember but they're all gone.

02:30:53.179 --> 02:30:53.982
TRAVIS: Shit.

02:30:53.982 --> 02:30:57.073
MATT: There's just nubs out of the wall.

02:30:57.073 --> 02:30:58.893
TRAVIS: All right, I turn around and I leave.

02:30:58.893 --> 02:30:59.526
MATT: Okay.

02:30:59.526 --> 02:31:00.404
LIAM: Oh!

02:31:00.404 --> 02:31:00.992
TRAVIS: Hi!

02:31:00.992 --> 02:31:01.663
LIAM: Hey!

02:31:01.663 --> 02:31:02.907
TRAVIS: Oh!

02:31:02.907 --> 02:31:03.677
LIAM: There you are.

02:31:03.677 --> 02:31:05.294
TRAVIS: Yes.

02:31:05.294 --> 02:31:07.702
TRAVIS: Chased off a, uh, yup.

02:31:07.702 --> 02:31:09.270
LIAM: What were you doing in there?

02:31:09.270 --> 02:31:10.975
TRAVIS: Securing the castle.

02:31:10.975 --> 02:31:12.639
LIAM: In the dark room with nobody in it?

02:31:12.639 --> 02:31:17.964
TRAVIS: Yeah, no, there was a guy, right? And I
like, "Hey you, stop!"

02:31:17.964 --> 02:31:22.928
and he was covered in this black powder and he 
just he gave me the slip.

02:31:22.928 --> 02:31:23.978
LIAM: He ran out?

02:31:23.978 --> 02:31:24.753
TRAVIS: Yup.

02:31:24.753 --> 02:31:25.923
LIAM: That's who that was.

02:31:25.923 --> 02:31:26.832
TRAVIS: You saw him!

02:31:26.832 --> 02:31:27.398
LIAM: I did.

02:31:27.398 --> 02:31:28.365
TRAVIS: Why'd you let him go?

02:31:28.365 --> 02:31:28.961
LIAM: He's fast.

02:31:28.961 --> 02:31:30.318
(all laugh)

02:31:30.318 --> 02:31:33.800
LIAM: I don't like to get in between you and a
kill, Big Man.

02:31:33.800 --> 02:31:36.593
TRAVIS: I should go after him, then.

02:31:36.593 --> 02:31:38.875
LIAM: You know, I just was looking
for you.

02:31:38.875 --> 02:31:41.162
TRAVIS: Oh. I have a moment.

02:31:41.162 --> 02:31:53.572
LIAM: Yeah. yeah. Ah, I just wanted to thank you 
for working your magic yesterday again.

02:31:53.572 --> 02:31:54.285
TRAVIS: Me?

02:31:54.285 --> 02:32:10.908
LIAM: Yeah. You saved him. You saved him. You did
good, Grog.

02:32:10.908 --> 02:32:33.613
I'm proud of you. And, don't hurt me, I
love you. Thank you.

02:32:33.613 --> 02:32:36.128
I slap him as hard as I
can.

02:32:36.128 --> 02:32:36.996
MATT: (Echoing slap)

02:32:36.996 --> 02:32:39.540
LIAM: And I use Disengage and I fucking run like
balls!

02:32:39.540 --> 02:32:49.340
(all laugh)

02:32:49.340 --> 02:32:54.252
MATT: He's gone. The sting fades.

02:32:54.252 --> 02:32:58.609
TRAVIS: Huh. Okay.

02:32:58.609 --> 02:33:01.998
(all awww)

02:33:01.998 --> 02:33:03.961
MARISHA: So adorable.

02:33:03.961 --> 02:33:08.508
MATT: All right, so you guys have checked
the keep, secured it, everything

02:33:08.508 --> 02:33:18.285
seems in the right place given the circumstances,
what do you want to do?

02:33:18.285 --> 02:33:20.283
MARISHA: What time is it?

02:33:20.283 --> 02:33:24.499
MATT: At this point it's maybe early afternoon.

02:33:24.499 --> 02:33:25.604
MARISHA: Oh, man.

02:33:25.604 --> 02:33:28.306
LAURA: Should probably head out. Then I'm back,
right?

02:33:28.306 --> 02:33:30.478
MATT: You've returned by the time that
they've gone through and checked the whole keep,

02:33:30.478 --> 02:33:33.235
you made it to Allura and back. It's been a
couple hours in the Keep.

02:33:33.235 --> 02:33:35.499
LAURA: Sweet.

02:33:35.499 --> 02:33:41.128
MARISHA: So... we're just going to go bury ashes
in Vasselheim?

02:33:41.128 --> 02:33:43.107
LAURA: Check one off the list.

02:33:43.107 --> 02:33:44.097
TALIESIN: One a day.

02:33:44.097 --> 02:33:47.311
MARISHA: No fighting?

02:33:47.311 --> 02:33:48.020
TRAVIS: What?

02:33:48.020 --> 02:33:48.706
LAURA: In Vasselheim?

02:33:48.706 --> 02:33:50.466
MARISHA: Yeah, we're not gonna get into any 
fights, right?

02:33:50.466 --> 02:33:51.695
LIAM: Not if we can help it.

02:33:51.695 --> 02:33:52.541
MARISHA: Okay.

02:33:52.541 --> 02:33:53.373
TALIESIN: That's the hope.

02:33:53.373 --> 02:33:56.375
MARISHA: Grog, why are you making that face,
Grog?

02:33:56.375 --> 02:33:57.601
TRAVIS: I'm holding my breath.

02:33:57.601 --> 02:33:59.548
LAURA and MARISHA: Why are you holding your
breath?

02:33:59.548 --> 02:34:06.042
TRAVIS: Hiccups? No fights at all? Like, what if we run into
bad people?

02:34:06.042 --> 02:34:09.019
MARISHA: If we run into bad people, we can fight
them.

02:34:09.019 --> 02:34:14.083
TALIESIN: Can I roll a perception check on his
hands?

02:34:14.083 --> 02:34:16.652
MATT: You know what, what's your passive
perception?

02:34:16.652 --> 02:34:17.489
TALIESIN: 18.

02:34:17.489 --> 02:34:19.501
TRAVIS: Don't make him roll-- make him roll for it.

02:34:19.501 --> 02:34:25.017
(all laugh)

02:34:25.017 --> 02:34:28.199
MATT: He was not actively looking, he
normally does not check for your hands, Grog, but

02:34:28.199 --> 02:34:32.578
he's a perceptive guy and there is indeed a very
dark familiar residual--

02:34:32.578 --> 02:34:33.693
MARISHA: Powder?

02:34:33.693 --> 02:34:37.939
MATT: --on the hands, forearms, and a little bit on
the top of the cheek.

02:34:37.939 --> 02:34:40.156
TALIESIN: Good to know.

02:34:40.211 --> 02:34:43.582
LIAM: (laughs) It's like an eight-year-old with
chocolate across his face

02:34:43.582 --> 02:34:44.591
(all laugh)

02:34:44.591 --> 02:34:45.476
MATT: Kinda.

02:34:45.476 --> 02:34:46.956
ASHLEY: I didn't get into it.

02:34:46.956 --> 02:34:47.761
MARISHA: I didn't eat any.

02:34:47.761 --> 02:34:50.460
TRAVIS: No unnecessary fights.

02:34:50.460 --> 02:34:51.873
MARISHA: No unnecessary fights.

02:34:51.873 --> 02:34:52.634
TALIESIN: No.

02:34:52.634 --> 02:34:53.292
MARISHA: Okay.

02:34:53.292 --> 02:34:54.202
TRAVIS: Yup.

02:34:54.202 --> 02:34:55.120
MARISHA: All right.

02:34:55.120 --> 02:34:57.133
LIAM: I mean, the crucible is there.

02:34:57.133 --> 02:35:01.256
MARISHA: Well, that's not unnecessary.

02:35:01.256 --> 02:35:04.814
ASHLEY: Wait, he said we can't open the box, 
right? Or did he say?

02:35:04.814 --> 02:35:07.685
LAURA: He didn't say not to.

02:35:07.685 --> 02:35:09.841
TALIESIN: Seems a bit disrespectful.

02:35:09.841 --> 02:35:12.343
LAURA: He said it was his wife's ashes after all.

02:35:12.343 --> 02:35:15.150
ASHLEY: I know, Okay.

02:35:15.150 --> 02:35:17.011
TRAVIS: Why would you want to-- 
do you not like--

02:35:17.011 --> 02:35:18.834
LAURA: Do you not trust it?

02:35:18.834 --> 02:35:23.516
ASHLEY: No, I just wanna know for sure

02:35:23.516 --> 02:35:27.826
MARISHA: Didn't we kinda look before?
We thought the same thing and it's--

02:35:27.826 --> 02:35:29.559
LAURA: Did we look, though? Did we look--

02:35:29.559 --> 02:35:31.262
MATT: I don't recall you looking in--

02:35:31.262 --> 02:35:33.271
MARISHA: But didn't we do an insight
check and--

02:35:33.271 --> 02:35:35.343
LAURA: And, I mean, I had Allura look at the box.

02:35:35.343 --> 02:35:36.098
MARISHA: Right.

02:35:36.098 --> 02:35:38.485
LAURA: She said it had a faint magical aura of protection.

02:35:38.485 --> 02:35:40.003
MARISHA: But it was protection.

02:35:40.003 --> 02:35:42.003
LIAM: Could you shake it like a yuletide present?

02:35:42.003 --> 02:35:42.837
LAURA: No.

02:35:42.837 --> 02:35:43.616
LIAM: No.

02:35:43.616 --> 02:35:47.433
ASHLEY: Maybe it's actually somebody requesting
that we do something that is nice then,

02:35:47.433 --> 02:35:49.121
which I feel like never happens.

02:35:49.121 --> 02:35:50.401
(all laughs)

02:35:50.401 --> 02:35:53.844
MARISHA: From what I remember from my--
I can look, right?

02:35:53.844 --> 02:35:55.006
ASHLEY: I don't trust anybody anymore.

02:35:55.006 --> 02:35:56.533
MARISHA: From Senokir, cause didn't I do 
an insight check?

02:35:56.533 --> 02:35:57.148
MATT: Yup.

02:35:57.148 --> 02:35:59.126
TALIESIN: I would love the notion that the one
time that we actually follow through with this

02:35:59.126 --> 02:36:02.179
very simple and basic thing that we aim to do and
just everything goes to shit.

02:36:02.179 --> 02:36:04.477
MARISHA: We plant a seed of a demon spawn.

02:36:04.477 --> 02:36:07.569
TALIESIN: Really lovely, very us.

02:36:07.569 --> 02:36:11.296
TALIESIN: This time everybody goes to shit because
it's the one

02:36:11.296 --> 02:36:14.905
purely altruistic thing that we do.

02:36:14.905 --> 02:36:18.959
MARISHA: Okay, hang on, hang on.

02:36:18.959 --> 02:36:20.059
TALIESIN: My god, your notes.

02:36:20.059 --> 02:36:21.350
MARISHA: Give me a second.

02:36:21.350 --> 02:36:23.353
TALIESIN: No, these are amazing.

02:36:23.353 --> 02:36:24.621
MARISHA: His wifes name was Zofin?

02:36:24.621 --> 02:36:25.955
LAURA: Playing with those dice, are you?

02:36:25.955 --> 02:36:27.219
MATT: I'm just turning dice over and
over again in my dice pile.

02:36:27.219 --> 02:36:28.916
MARISHA: Senokir's wife was Zofin?

02:36:28.916 --> 02:36:29.847
MATT: Zaafin.

02:36:29.847 --> 02:36:31.404
MARISHA: Zaafin?

02:36:31.404 --> 02:36:32.350
ASHLEY: Zofah.

02:36:32.350 --> 02:36:33.261
LIAM: So fine.

02:36:33.261 --> 02:36:34.316
TRAVIS: Why don't you check it?

02:36:34.316 --> 02:36:38.450
LAURA: So fiiine.

02:36:38.450 --> 02:36:40.764
MARISHA: Nope, that's all I got.

02:36:40.764 --> 02:36:42.890
LAURA: If you want to do it, just do it.

02:36:42.890 --> 02:36:44.257
MARISHA: I feel like I remember--

02:36:44.257 --> 02:36:45.901
TRAVIS: It's your say, go for it.

02:36:45.901 --> 02:36:50.548
TALIESIN: I think we should make a tree 
and head in that direction.

02:36:50.548 --> 02:36:52.320
MARISHA: Well, we already have a tree, but yeah.

02:36:52.320 --> 02:36:54.067
TALIESIN: All in favor of jumping through that
tree--

02:36:54.067 --> 02:36:57.717
MARISHA: Make like a leaf and wait--
Make like a tree and leave. (Laughs)

02:36:57.717 --> 02:36:58.754
LAURA: Yeah.

02:36:58.889 --> 02:37:00.192
TRAVIS: I don't know, ask him.

02:37:00.192 --> 02:37:01.727
ASHLEY: Was the box already checked for traps?

02:37:01.727 --> 02:37:04.183
MATT: You don't know.

02:37:04.183 --> 02:37:05.761
ASHLEY: Can I check it for traps?

02:37:05.761 --> 02:37:07.471
MATT: Make an investigation check.

02:37:07.471 --> 02:37:08.112
ASHLEY: Okay.

02:37:08.112 --> 02:37:09.071
TRAVIS: Do what you want, man.

02:37:09.071 --> 02:37:10.722
LAURA: Should we scoot this forward a little bit?

02:37:10.722 --> 02:37:16.324
MATT: As you guys are walking up, heading your way
up into the temple area with the singular tree

02:37:16.324 --> 02:37:20.524
used for transportation before, Pike is just
holding and inspecting the box as you walk.

02:37:20.524 --> 02:37:21.955
ASHLEY: I got an eight.

02:37:21.955 --> 02:37:23.094
LAURA: What're you doing, Pike?

02:37:23.094 --> 02:37:27.215
MATT: Eight? It's hard to tell, looks pretty safe.

02:37:27.215 --> 02:37:28.737
LAURA: Do you not trust it?

02:37:28.737 --> 02:37:30.941
ASHLEY: I just don't trust anybody anymore.

02:37:30.941 --> 02:37:33.512
TRAVIS: Man, I know what that's like.

02:37:33.512 --> 02:37:38.204
ASHLEY: Okay, I'm not good at--
Okay, let's go.

02:37:38.204 --> 02:37:39.490
MATT: All right.

02:37:39.490 --> 02:37:40.767
ASHLEY: Let's go.

02:37:40.767 --> 02:37:42.791
LIAM: What's on your mind?

02:37:42.791 --> 02:37:45.114
ASHLEY: I just feel like this is something 
fishy about it,

02:37:45.114 --> 02:37:49.599
it just seems too easy, you know?

02:37:49.599 --> 02:37:50.833
LAURA: Too simple for us?

02:37:50.833 --> 02:37:52.062
ASHLEY: Too simple.

02:37:52.062 --> 02:37:55.605
ASHLEY: To just take a box and go bury it? Why
couldn't he do it?

02:37:55.605 --> 02:37:57.370
I know we already talked about this.

02:37:57.370 --> 02:37:59.838
MARISHA: Well wasn't he kind of stuck in the Fire
Plane--

02:37:59.838 --> 02:38:01.539
TRAVIS: Yeah, he's not allowed.

02:38:01.539 --> 02:38:02.227
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:38:02.227 --> 02:38:02.868
ASHLEY: All right.

02:38:02.868 --> 02:38:05.164
LAURA: He's not? He's not allowed? I don't
remember him saying that.

02:38:05.164 --> 02:38:06.415
TRAVIS: I might have made that up.

02:38:06.415 --> 02:38:08.714
(all laugh)

02:38:08.714 --> 02:38:11.175
MATT: He said he had been intending to make a trip
to Vasselheim to bury it himself

02:38:11.175 --> 02:38:13.187
but he hasn't had
the time or the ability to do so.

02:38:13.187 --> 02:38:18.200
LAURA: Seems odd, right? I mean, it is his wife's
ashes.

02:38:18.200 --> 02:38:20.844
MARISHA: Oh man, you guys, I thought this was
something sweet

02:38:20.844 --> 02:38:22.939
and we weren't gonna question it
and now we're making it complicated.

02:38:22.939 --> 02:38:24.184
TRAVIS: You're right, yeah

02:38:24.184 --> 02:38:25.669
TRAVIS: You're right. We're thinking too much.

02:38:25.669 --> 02:38:27.442
LIAM: Are we saying there's no one in the world 
who's truthful? At all?

02:38:27.442 --> 02:38:30.499
MARISHA: I don't know anymore. We're all too
scarred and damaged.

02:38:30.499 --> 02:38:39.074
LAURA: Some people are truthful, but I mean 
Senokir did wanna make us his slaves--

02:38:39.074 --> 02:38:43.198
MARISHA: We were all on board for this until 20
seconds ago when we started questioning it!

02:38:43.198 --> 02:38:44.516
(all laugh)

02:38:44.516 --> 02:38:48.528
ASHLEY: I'm sorry! I just-- (sighs)

02:38:48.528 --> 02:38:50.331
LAURA: Pike could be saving our lives right now.

02:38:50.331 --> 02:38:50.989
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:38:50.989 --> 02:38:52.506
ASHLEY: Or I could be killing all of us.

02:38:52.506 --> 02:38:57.527
LIAM: Well, the bottom line is, he's probably
never gonna know if we take a peek.

02:38:57.527 --> 02:38:58.836
ASHLEY: What if I just take a peek?

02:38:58.836 --> 02:38:59.830
MARISHA: Vax!

02:38:59.830 --> 02:39:01.973
TRAVIS: Oh wait, that's a good idea.

02:39:01.973 --> 02:39:04.894
ASHLEY: Or like open it to a mirror.

02:39:04.894 --> 02:39:05.957
LAURA: Ooh.

02:39:05.957 --> 02:39:07.667
MARISHA: Are we taking a peek?

02:39:07.667 --> 02:39:08.653
MARISHA: Or never doing it.

02:39:08.653 --> 02:39:09.993
TRAVIS: I mean, she is quite holy right?

02:39:09.993 --> 02:39:13.507
Like, if anyone was gonna look on those
sacred remains least it would be old stinker here.

02:39:13.507 --> 02:39:17.303
LAURA: I mean, it does have a magical aura of
protection so it might be--

02:39:17.303 --> 02:39:18.554
ASHLEY: It might hurt me.

02:39:18.554 --> 02:39:19.275
MARISHA: It might backfire.

02:39:19.275 --> 02:39:23.564
LIAM: I'm not gonna open it, can I look
at it? Can I look for locks or traps?

02:39:23.564 --> 02:39:25.950
I'm not opening it.

02:39:25.950 --> 02:39:26.868
MATT: Look for traps.

02:39:26.868 --> 02:39:31.960
LIAM: Yeah? Oooh. That is a 22.

02:39:31.960 --> 02:39:37.399
MATT: 22. It is not trapped.

02:39:37.399 --> 02:39:38.818
LIAM: And I don't know if it's locked.

02:39:38.818 --> 02:39:41.926
MATT: Well, go ahead and make a roll 
to see if it's locked.

02:39:41.926 --> 02:39:42.882
LIAM: Ooh.

02:39:42.882 --> 02:39:43.763
LAURA: (laughs)

02:39:43.763 --> 02:39:45.530
LIAM: That's even better, that's a 30.

02:39:45.530 --> 02:39:51.106
MATT: 30. It is locked, there are four individual
locks in each side--

02:39:51.106 --> 02:39:52.035
LIAM: Four locks?

02:39:52.035 --> 02:39:57.952
MATT: And it appears that there is some sort 
of a-- usually when something like that has a

02:39:57.952 --> 02:40:02.279
little bit of give against the chain, the box has
none.

02:40:02.279 --> 02:40:06.920
That usually either means it's adhered or
it's sealed magically.

02:40:06.920 --> 02:40:09.068
LIAM: Pickle, I will help you if you want,

02:40:09.068 --> 02:40:12.467
but my gut is telling me that this is 
just his wife's ashes.

02:40:12.467 --> 02:40:15.401
ASHLEY: Shake it. Listen.

02:40:15.401 --> 02:40:18.654
TRAVIS: I second that.

02:40:18.654 --> 02:40:20.351
MATT: Make a perception check.

02:40:20.351 --> 02:40:21.890
LAURA: I put my hands up and walk a little bit
away.

02:40:21.890 --> 02:40:24.831
LIAM: 30 again!

02:40:24.831 --> 02:40:27.373
MATT: You hear what sounds like the very gentle
sifting of

02:40:27.373 --> 02:40:31.094
some very, very light particles inside
of a box.

02:40:31.094 --> 02:40:34.939
LIAM: Yeah, yeah, I think he's telling us the
truth.

02:40:34.939 --> 02:40:39.809
MARISHA: Vax, the Raven Queen is like your girl.

02:40:39.809 --> 02:40:40.643
LIAM: Yeah.

02:40:40.643 --> 02:40:44.949
MARISHA: Can you maybe, like, there is remains in
here--

02:40:44.949 --> 02:40:46.642
LAURA: Can you both just ask, you know?

02:40:46.642 --> 02:40:48.869
TRAVIS: Yeah, like, yo, is this the dead or--

02:40:48.869 --> 02:40:58.953
MARISHA: Pike, you're a cleric, if you're that
concerned. Man, this is so extravagant, you guys.

02:40:58.953 --> 02:41:00.763
TALIESIN: How paranoid has everybody gotten?

02:41:00.763 --> 02:41:03.554
LIAM: I'm gonna use my paladin powers. There's
nothing undead in there, is there?

02:41:03.554 --> 02:41:04.986
ASHLEY: Divine Intervention?

02:41:04.986 --> 02:41:06.571
TALIESIN: Wow.

02:41:06.571 --> 02:41:08.333
MATT: Okay, so you're using your--

02:41:08.333 --> 02:41:09.302
LIAM: Divine Sense, yeah.

02:41:09.302 --> 02:41:13.814
MATT: Divine Sense. You do not get a fiendish or
undead aura from the box.

02:41:13.814 --> 02:41:17.538
LIAM: Yeah, man, this is just the guy's wife.

02:41:17.538 --> 02:41:20.577
ASHLEY: What if we bury it and it turns into
something crazy?

02:41:20.577 --> 02:41:22.520
TRAVIS: What have you been reading?

02:41:22.520 --> 02:41:23.940
ASHLEY: I don't know.

02:41:23.940 --> 02:41:25.178
MARISHA: When he told us it was his wife, we all
went,

02:41:25.178 --> 02:41:29.276
awww, when that happened. And now we're
questioning it.

02:41:29.276 --> 02:41:32.897
ASHLEY: But that's what a shyster does! You know?

02:41:32.897 --> 02:41:34.578
LIAM: You're so hardened by the war.

02:41:34.578 --> 02:41:38.384
ASHLEY: They tell you things to make you feel bad!
To buy their magazines!

02:41:38.384 --> 02:41:41.138
(all laugh)

02:41:41.138 --> 02:41:42.514
ASHLEY: You know?

02:41:42.514 --> 02:41:44.402
TALIESIN: This is getting weirdly personal.

02:41:44.402 --> 02:41:47.815
MARISHA: Who is trying to sell you magazine
subscriptions? Who?

02:41:47.815 --> 02:41:49.264
ASHLEY: Just... everyone!

02:41:49.264 --> 02:41:51.260
TALIESIN: What high schooler hurt you?

02:41:51.260 --> 02:41:54.762
LAURA: We just fought Raishan, I don't blame this.

02:41:54.762 --> 02:41:55.847
LIAM: Pickle, Pickle, Pickle--

02:41:55.847 --> 02:41:57.954
ASHLEY: Everyone in Whitestone. You guys haven't
been there long enough.

02:41:57.954 --> 02:41:58.940
LIAM: Pickle, Pickle.

02:41:58.940 --> 02:41:59.941
ASHLEY: Yes.

02:41:59.941 --> 02:42:03.293
LIAM: There is a fucking tiger-faced demon who
wants both you and I dead.

02:42:03.293 --> 02:42:07.404
We have bigger problems
than this man's wife's ashes.

02:42:07.404 --> 02:42:08.830
MARISHA: Pike, we have to sail the ocean!

02:42:08.830 --> 02:42:10.006
TALIESIN: People haven't sold you a subscription
to Highlights.

02:42:10.006 --> 02:42:12.527
ASHLEY: I know. All right, let's go bury the, you
know.

02:42:12.527 --> 02:42:13.567
LIAM: But you carry it.

02:42:13.567 --> 02:42:14.498
ASHLEY: I'll carry it.

02:42:14.498 --> 02:42:18.131
(all laugh)

02:42:18.131 --> 02:42:23.788
ASHLEY: I pop it under my arm. Let's go.

02:42:23.788 --> 02:42:25.601
MATT: Okay.

02:42:25.601 --> 02:42:29.793
MARISHA: I just wanna let you know, I feel you.

02:42:29.793 --> 02:42:31.460
ASHLEY: Okay.

02:42:31.460 --> 02:42:38.396
MARISHA: But I'm trying to make this our first
step into being a more positive Vox Machina.

02:42:38.396 --> 02:42:39.627
ASHLEY: Okay.

02:42:39.627 --> 02:42:41.509
TRAVIS: What's wrong with your face?

02:42:41.509 --> 02:42:43.169
MARISHA: This is me forcing a smile.

02:42:43.169 --> 02:42:45.655
TRAVIS: Oh.

02:42:45.655 --> 02:42:48.664
MARISHA: There's pain under here. That's why it
looks like that.

02:42:48.664 --> 02:42:49.270
TRAVIS: Right.

02:42:49.270 --> 02:42:50.650
LAURA: You're not supposed to say all those
things.

02:42:50.650 --> 02:42:53.767
MARISHA: Sorry. Oh, right, I'm supposed to hide
behind and bottle those emotions.

02:42:53.767 --> 02:42:54.600
LAURA: Yeah.

02:42:54.600 --> 02:42:57.060
MARISHA: Right. No, things are great.

02:42:57.060 --> 02:42:58.635
LAURA: That's good, that's good, that's good.

02:42:58.635 --> 02:43:01.032
MARISHA: Yeah, that's how normal people talk,
right? Things are great.

02:43:01.032 --> 02:43:03.758
TRAVIS: We just bury it in the tree, that's it. In
the tree.

02:43:03.758 --> 02:43:05.401
ASHLEY: No, we got her name, right?

02:43:05.401 --> 02:43:06.432
MARISHA: Yes.

02:43:06.432 --> 02:43:09.592
ASHLEY: So we'll make her a little tombstone,
we'll do a whole thing, then.

02:43:09.592 --> 02:43:10.539
LAURA: Yeah.

02:43:10.539 --> 02:43:12.383
LIAM: We'll do a whole thing, we'll bury the
ashes--

02:43:12.383 --> 02:43:14.531
ASHLEY: We're gonna make it nice.

02:43:14.531 --> 02:43:18.120
TALIESIN: I am genuinely worried about everybody.

02:43:18.120 --> 02:43:23.549
ASHLEY: Put Grasping Vines all over it.

02:43:23.549 --> 02:43:25.039
TRAVIS: Bada-bing, bada-bam.

02:43:25.039 --> 02:43:26.729
MATT: The Conclave arc has taken its toll on Vox
Machina.

02:43:26.729 --> 02:43:30.254
(All laugh.)

02:43:30.254 --> 02:43:33.998
MARISHA: We're all huddled around a box, just
like, freaking out right now.

02:43:33.998 --> 02:43:37.827
LIAM: Vex just draws on that box.

02:43:37.827 --> 02:43:46.490
TRAVIS: One little fucking box. Reveal your
secrets!

02:43:46.490 --> 02:43:47.602
MATT: So, Keyleth.

02:43:47.602 --> 02:43:49.377
MARISHA: All right, let's go.

02:43:49.377 --> 02:43:50.494
ASHLEY: Let's go.

02:43:50.494 --> 02:43:53.345
MATT: Okay, so what are you connecting to?

02:43:53.345 --> 02:43:54.606
MARISHA: Huh? What?

02:43:54.606 --> 02:43:55.813
TALIESIN: The other side of the tree.

02:43:55.813 --> 02:43:58.953
MATT: The other side of the tree. Where are you
sending? You have many options at your disposal.

02:43:58.953 --> 02:44:02.651
You have the outskirts of the city, there's the
lush forest, the Vesper Timberland.

02:44:02.651 --> 02:44:04.259
MARISHA: He told us where to bury her, right?

02:44:04.259 --> 02:44:05.918
MATT: He said the Abundant Terrace, which you have
passed by.

02:44:05.918 --> 02:44:07.399
MARISHA: I have passed by?

02:44:07.399 --> 02:44:08.299
MATT: Yeah.

02:44:08.299 --> 02:44:11.732
LAURA: We should stick to the outside of the city,
right? Because of the magical laws there--

02:44:11.732 --> 02:44:15.609
MATT: Well, the Abundant Terrace is a very heavily
wooded area.

02:44:15.609 --> 02:44:17.686
MARISHA: On the outskirts.

02:44:17.686 --> 02:44:21.015
MATT: And the magical laws are more about rampant
arcane casting.

02:44:21.015 --> 02:44:27.469
Divination and divine magics
generally fall more into the territory of respect

02:44:27.469 --> 02:44:31.503
as long as they're relatively controlled and not a
grand display of power.

02:44:31.503 --> 02:44:32.781
LAURA: Solid.

02:44:32.781 --> 02:44:35.499
MARISHA: So the Abundant Terrace is a forest on
the outskirts of the town?

02:44:35.499 --> 02:44:38.368
MATT: The Abundant Terrace is Melora's section of
the city.

02:44:38.368 --> 02:44:39.343
LAURA: Melora!

02:44:39.343 --> 02:44:40.763
MARISHA: Oh, right, right, right.

02:44:40.763 --> 02:44:46.323
MATT: It's where-- it's a district that has
maintained magical fertility for growing crops and

02:44:46.323 --> 02:44:51.814
plants and it's basically where a lot of the food
for Vasselheim is grown.

02:44:51.814 --> 02:44:57.452
MARISHA: Oh, perfect. Farming district. Okay. Is
there a tree there?

02:44:57.452 --> 02:45:03.238
MATT: There are a number of trees, actually. A
number of the homes are actually built in--

02:45:03.238 --> 02:45:04.724
MARISHA: In trees? That's cool.

02:45:04.724 --> 02:45:05.646
LIAM: Sick!

02:45:05.646 --> 02:45:08.648
MARISHA: I want a tree house! Okay.

02:45:08.648 --> 02:45:16.722
And you said it's safe, this isn't arcane, 
it's natural, since Melora, I'll probably be okay?

02:45:16.722 --> 02:45:20.438
People aren't gonna look at us weird when
we come out of a tree on the other end?

02:45:20.438 --> 02:45:22.332
MATT: I mean, when you come out of a tree people
probably look at you weird anyway.

02:45:22.332 --> 02:45:23.418
MARISHA: Sure.

02:45:23.418 --> 02:45:25.169
ASHLEY: Do people bury their dead here?

02:45:25.169 --> 02:45:30.113
MATT: You don't know. Roll a history check.

02:45:30.113 --> 02:45:35.080
LAURA: But didn't he say that she was from this
area?

02:45:35.080 --> 02:45:36.911
TALIESIN: I'll join in this history check, this is
bothering me.

02:45:36.911 --> 02:45:39.303
MARISHA: Sofine? Sofin?

02:45:39.303 --> 02:45:40.049
MATT: Zaafin.

02:45:40.049 --> 02:45:41.280
LAURA and MARISHA: Zaafin.

02:45:41.280 --> 02:45:43.320
LAURA: Zaafin was from this area?

02:45:43.320 --> 02:45:46.441
MATT: Apparently, yes, this was where she came
from.

02:45:46.441 --> 02:45:49.175
ASHLEY: We both did a history check. 15.

02:45:49.175 --> 02:45:50.229
TALIESIN: 26.

02:45:50.229 --> 02:45:52.066
ASHLEY: Well, there you go.

02:45:52.066 --> 02:46:00.314
MATT: Okay. I mean, usually the dead are interred
in specific graveyards.

02:46:00.314 --> 02:46:04.778
Some people do prefer to have their ashes spread 
in places that were important to them, it's just a

02:46:04.778 --> 02:46:11.438
general request, but the Birth Heart or the 
Abundant Terrace are not areas that are

02:46:11.438 --> 02:46:17.884
designated for interring the dead. So 
it is a special request.

02:46:17.884 --> 02:46:19.855
LAURA: Okay, I have a thought.

02:46:19.855 --> 02:46:21.347
TRAVIS: Oh no.

02:46:21.347 --> 02:46:26.277
LAURA: What if we do bury this where he's asked,

02:46:26.277 --> 02:46:32.775
but we put it inside of something that deters
magic?

02:46:32.775 --> 02:46:34.564
TRAVIS and LIAM: Like what?

02:46:34.564 --> 02:46:39.984
LAURA: I don't know. Like a fine container or
something. It was just a thought. Isn't there

02:46:39.984 --> 02:46:46.320
things like that? Like a chest or something that
dispels magic so that if he is trying to do

02:46:46.320 --> 02:46:50.698
something nefarious, then we keep him from doing
that.

02:46:50.698 --> 02:46:53.166
LIAM: You want to go find an arcane shop--

02:46:53.166 --> 02:46:54.166
ASHLEY: Like a container store.

02:46:54.166 --> 02:46:55.887
LIAM: -- find a very expensive container...

02:46:55.887 --> 02:46:58.598
TRAVIS: This seems really out of the way for what
is a simple burial.

02:46:58.598 --> 02:47:03.508
TALIESIN: How about we just ask a few questions to
see if anyone remembers his wife?

02:47:03.508 --> 02:47:04.170
LAURA: Good call.

02:47:04.170 --> 02:47:05.496
TRAVIS: Hey! Yes.

02:47:05.496 --> 02:47:06.195
LAURA: I like it.

02:47:06.195 --> 02:47:08.654
TALIESIN: Maybe she left some sort of connection
to this place.

02:47:08.654 --> 02:47:11.689
LAURA: Could you cast Speak with the Dead on
ashes?

02:47:11.689 --> 02:47:13.119
TRAVIS: Oh my god.

02:47:13.119 --> 02:47:15.284
TALIESIN: Yes, but they just say shkshkshkshk.

02:47:15.284 --> 02:47:19.124
(all laugh)

02:47:19.124 --> 02:47:20.365
MARISHA: That's probably true.

02:47:20.365 --> 02:47:21.606
TRAVIS: Like baby powder.

02:47:21.606 --> 02:47:27.304
LIAM: We saved the world, but we are still a bunch
of assholes.

02:47:27.304 --> 02:47:29.168
MATT: A corpse still requires a mouth to speak.

02:47:29.168 --> 02:47:30.821
TRAVIS: Let's get over there.

02:47:30.821 --> 02:47:33.880
MARISHA: (laughs) We saved the world, but we're
still a bunch of assholes.

02:47:33.880 --> 02:47:36.557
MATT: It doesn't work. All right, so. Keyleth,
what--

02:47:36.557 --> 02:47:38.060
TRAVIS: The wondrous sand doesn't come up?

02:47:38.060 --> 02:47:39.599
MARISHA: What am I doing?

02:47:39.599 --> 02:47:42.309
MATT: Are you going to come popping out within the
city? Abundant Terrace?

02:47:42.309 --> 02:47:43.226
LAURA: Abundant Terrace.

02:47:43.226 --> 02:47:44.138
ASHLEY: Yeah, Abundant Terrace.

02:47:44.138 --> 02:47:45.306
MARISHA: Abundant Terrace, ho!

02:47:45.306 --> 02:47:46.090
MATT: All right.

02:47:46.090 --> 02:47:47.129
ASHLEY: We'll decide when we get there.

02:47:47.129 --> 02:47:48.647
MATT: The tree-- (laughs)

02:47:48.647 --> 02:47:50.179
MARISHA: We'll have six seconds to think about it.

02:47:50.179 --> 02:47:52.052
LAURA: Be an idiot!

02:47:52.052 --> 02:47:58.203
MATT: The tree shreds open into the familiar oval
or diamond-shaped entryway. On the opposite side,

02:47:58.203 --> 02:48:04.273
you see the cold landscape, or at least the cold
sky of Vasselheim, though surrounding you it is

02:48:04.273 --> 02:48:09.331
just verdant green. You can see moss and bushes
and grass, and a number of tree trunks around you.

02:48:09.331 --> 02:48:16.833
You can see a very clear-cut path that walks
through like an intentional park walkway. As you

02:48:16.833 --> 02:48:23.676
all emerge, you find yourself looking up into the
relatively grey, heavily cloud-covered sky, and it

02:48:23.676 --> 02:48:31.974
is very cold. You watch as very, very faint snow
drifts to the ground, but it doesn't touch, it

02:48:31.974 --> 02:48:37.419
immediately evaporates before it hits the ground.
It seems either the warmth of the area or an

02:48:37.419 --> 02:48:42.765
enchantment of some kind is resistant to the
weather of this northern continent.

02:48:42.765 --> 02:48:48.811
MARISHA: Can I do a quick nature check to see if
this is a mystical realm

02:48:48.811 --> 02:48:51.748
or if they've done
something naturey to make it--

02:48:51.748 --> 02:48:57.446
MATT: Nature check.

02:48:57.446 --> 02:48:58.226
MARISHA: 22.

02:48:58.226 --> 02:49:09.178
MATT: 22. The snow would usually touch the ground,
and then slowly turn to water and melt, if it was

02:49:09.178 --> 02:49:13.952
just a difference between the ground. However, the
snow never reaches within a foot, it just kind of

02:49:13.952 --> 02:49:19.930
drifts and then (poof). So it does appear to be an
enchantment or some sort of magical essence to the

02:49:19.930 --> 02:49:27.744
Abundant Terrace itself. But you are surrounded by
a forest that has very beautifully kept walkways

02:49:27.744 --> 02:49:32.390
in a grid-type pattern. You do see some people
that are walking through, a couple hand-in-hand,

02:49:32.390 --> 02:49:40.332
almost like they're just on a stroll, bunched furs
around their shoulders. You can see a little ways

02:49:40.332 --> 02:49:45.764
down, the trees stop, and it opens up into what
looks to be an expanse of farmland, rows and rows

02:49:45.764 --> 02:49:55.036
and rows of various crops that are perpetually
being planted, pulled up, and harvested. There is

02:49:55.036 --> 02:49:58.710
no harvest season in Vasselheim because of the
enchantment of the Abundant Terrace.

02:49:58.710 --> 02:50:01.569
It is perpetually fertile and bearing--

02:50:01.569 --> 02:50:02.336
TRAVIS: That's awesome.

02:50:02.336 --> 02:50:04.947
LAURA: Wow.

02:50:04.947 --> 02:50:10.315
MATT: You haven't done a full pass of this area,
but it's not densely populated.

02:50:10.315 --> 02:50:17.705
What people come here either are working the 
land, keeping the land, or are enjoying the

02:50:17.705 --> 02:50:27.768
change in scenery from the rest of what can 
be sometimes a more, I guess you would say,

02:50:27.768 --> 02:50:37.176
grey and expressionless landscape that some 
parts of the city tend to hold.

02:50:37.176 --> 02:50:40.567
But here you are at the Abundant Terrace. 
What do you want to do?

02:50:40.567 --> 02:50:48.012
MARISHA: I remember he said he wanted us to plant
the box under a tree.

02:50:48.012 --> 02:50:50.995
MATT: He said to bury it beneath the Birth Heart
in the Abundant Terrace.

02:50:50.995 --> 02:50:52.602
MARISHA: The Birth Heart.

02:50:52.602 --> 02:50:54.026
LIAM: That is not a random tree.

02:50:54.026 --> 02:50:55.861
LAURA: Is that couple pretty close?

02:50:55.861 --> 02:51:01.431
MATT: Yeah, they kinda walk by and look over. They
both appear to be human, the woman with darker

02:51:01.431 --> 02:51:07.529
hair, it's braided and pulled around to one side.
The man's a little older, dark beard that kinda

02:51:07.529 --> 02:51:13.181
goes to grey around the mustache and the chin,
dark hair that's slicked back and it's kinda long

02:51:13.181 --> 02:51:16.767
in the back. Both have their furs around their
shoulders, and she has her arm around his arm and

02:51:16.767 --> 02:51:22.132
they just walk past, and glance back at you with
a, huh, they just walked out of a tree.

02:51:22.132 --> 02:51:23.079
ASHLEY: Hello.

02:51:23.079 --> 02:51:24.426
MARISHA: Hi.

02:51:24.426 --> 02:51:25.421
MATT: Hello.

02:51:25.421 --> 02:51:31.708
ASHLEY: Do you-- do you guys live here, or are you
just passing through, or checking out the town?

02:51:31.708 --> 02:51:35.549
MATT: We live in the Quad Roads, we're just out
here for a walk.

02:51:35.549 --> 02:51:48.415
ASHLEY: Beautiful place. Do you-- do you happen to
know, or knew of someone named, uh, Zaafin.

02:51:48.415 --> 02:51:51.446
MATT: "Zaafin?"

02:51:51.446 --> 02:51:54.191
He turns to his companion, she
looks up.

02:51:54.191 --> 02:51:57.693
"No, I don't recall anyone named Zaafin,
I'm sorry."

02:51:57.693 --> 02:52:04.449
"I do not either, my apologies. Good
day."

02:52:04.449 --> 02:52:06.592
They awkwardly continue walking.

02:52:06.592 --> 02:52:08.272
MARISHA: Ask them where the Birth Heart tree is!

02:52:08.272 --> 02:52:10.507
ASHLEY: Do you know where the Birth Heart tree is,
actually?

02:52:10.507 --> 02:52:12.258
MATT: She stops and turns back.

02:52:12.258 --> 02:52:17.994
"The Birth Heart is two paths up and to 
the right. It's hard to miss."

02:52:17.994 --> 02:52:20.504
ASHLEY: How long have you guys lived here?

02:52:20.504 --> 02:52:24.947
MATT: They kinda look at each other, back at you,
awkwardly.

02:52:24.947 --> 02:52:30.538
"My entire life. She lived up north in
Crossin but moved here ten years ago."

02:52:30.772 --> 02:52:33.495
ASHLEY: And you've never heard of a Zaafin?

02:52:33.495 --> 02:52:34.826
MATT: No.

02:52:34.826 --> 02:52:36.289
ASHLEY: Insight check?

02:52:36.289 --> 02:52:42.122
MATT: Yes, make an insight check.

02:52:42.122 --> 02:52:43.499
ASHLEY: 24.

02:52:43.499 --> 02:52:45.231
MATT: 24.

02:52:45.231 --> 02:52:46.776
ASHLEY: I get a whisper?

02:52:46.776 --> 02:52:48.753
MARISHA: Whispers!

02:52:48.753 --> 02:52:50.724
TALIESIN: If you wanna help build tension,

02:52:50.724 --> 02:52:53.783
Lootcrate will help you build a lot of things
today. Oh, stop it.

02:52:53.783 --> 02:52:55.295
MARISHA: With their next theme.

02:52:55.295 --> 02:52:56.618
TALIESIN and MARISHA: Build.

02:52:56.618 --> 02:52:58.547
TALIESIN: Build suspense. Build character.

02:52:58.547 --> 02:53:00.312
MARISHA: Build tension. Build stress.

02:53:00.312 --> 02:53:01.983
LAURA: Do you feel powerful when you go-- yeah?

02:53:01.983 --> 02:53:07.653
MARISHA: Yes, build anxiety disorders.

02:53:07.653 --> 02:53:09.195
LAURA: Did you just hijack her Twitter?

02:53:09.195 --> 02:53:11.401
LIAM: No.

02:53:11.401 --> 02:53:17.649
TALIESIN: (laughs) Sorry. Shit.

02:53:17.649 --> 02:53:18.871
MATT: Well done.

02:53:18.871 --> 02:53:22.711
ASHLEY: Thank you. Thank you very much for
stopping and talking with us.

02:53:22.711 --> 02:53:24.381
MATT: "Of course."

02:53:24.381 --> 02:53:30.442
And they continue their path, quicken their pace 
a bit, hoping to avoid any future questions.

02:53:30.442 --> 02:53:39.030
ASHLEY: They have no idea who she is. They just
wanted to be on their way.

02:53:39.030 --> 02:53:42.373
TRAVIS: Why is it called the Birth Heart tree?

02:53:42.373 --> 02:53:48.029
MARISHA: I guess we'll find out. They said we
couldn't miss it.

02:53:48.029 --> 02:53:49.491
TRAVIS: All right, let's go find it.

02:53:49.491 --> 02:53:50.696
MARISHA: All right.

02:53:50.696 --> 02:53:53.062
MATT: All right, you follow their instructions,
which involves you guys

02:53:53.062 --> 02:53:57.264
now following them about
40 feet back and they notice you.

02:53:57.264 --> 02:53:59.488
MARISHA: We're trying to do that thing where it's
not like

02:53:59.488 --> 02:54:01.782
you're walking to your car after you've
already said goodbye.

02:54:01.782 --> 02:54:02.848
MATT: Okay, so you hold back a bit.

02:54:02.848 --> 02:54:03.813
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:54:03.813 --> 02:54:09.569
MATT: They eventually turn the opposite direction.
Following instructions, you go up two paths and to

02:54:09.569 --> 02:54:19.686
the right, and you can see now-- amongst what is
a fair number of, I'd say 20-foot-tall trees that

02:54:19.686 --> 02:54:25.690
you've come across in this area, there is a large
domed cluster of trees, almost like a redwood

02:54:25.690 --> 02:54:35.161
forest dome of 100-foot-tall trees. This one, it
looks like Lothlorien in the distance.

02:54:35.161 --> 02:54:40.164
You have regular forest and this giant bump in 
the canopy.

02:54:40.164 --> 02:54:43.378
And you get the sense that's probably the Birth
Heart.

02:54:43.378 --> 02:54:48.657
LAURA: Does it kind of remind us of Sondur's tree?

02:54:48.657 --> 02:54:50.903
MATT: Sondur was a singular tree.

02:54:50.903 --> 02:54:54.189
This, from what you can tell, appears 
to be a cluster of many trees.

02:54:54.189 --> 02:54:58.856
LAURA: Okay.

02:54:58.856 --> 02:55:00.931
TRAVIS: Do we proceed towards it?

02:55:00.931 --> 02:55:02.203
MARISHA: Yeah, we do.

02:55:02.203 --> 02:55:03.242
LIAM: Yes, yes.

02:55:03.242 --> 02:55:05.927
MATT: All right. You guys push on, and as you
approach--

02:55:05.927 --> 02:55:09.318
TRAVIS: Can we keep an eye out for guards? Anybody
that might be watching us?

02:55:09.318 --> 02:55:11.222
MATT: Okay, make a perception check.

02:55:11.222 --> 02:55:12.088
TRAVIS: Me?

02:55:12.088 --> 02:55:14.321
MATT: Yes, you. He who asks.

02:55:14.321 --> 02:55:22.253
TRAVIS: He who asks rolls a ten.

02:55:22.253 --> 02:55:30.482
MATT: Okay. As you walk, you see a handful of
guards that just occasionally wander through.

02:55:30.482 --> 02:55:39.749
The Bastions wear patchwork armor, there isn't a
standard Bastion armor set, per se, but they do

02:55:39.749 --> 02:55:48.628
have elements of colors and cloths that symbolize
their station as well as some pins or badges that

02:55:48.628 --> 02:55:53.099
mark the symbol there. So you do pick up on a few
of them, and they're just kind of doing the

02:55:53.099 --> 02:55:58.134
rounds, and there are a couple that are curiously
keeping their distance and keeping an eye.

02:55:58.134 --> 02:56:00.568
But not following you, just, hm.

02:56:00.568 --> 02:56:02.433
TRAVIS: Bidet.

02:56:02.433 --> 02:56:06.048
MATT: Bidet?

02:56:06.048 --> 02:56:09.854
LAURA: Can I keep an eye out for any kind of
tombstones or

02:56:09.854 --> 02:56:12.976
anything in the area that looks like
anybody else might have done similar things?

02:56:12.976 --> 02:56:16.135
MATT: Sure. Perception check.

02:56:16.135 --> 02:56:20.720
LAURA: Oh, is it at advantage because we're in a
forest?

02:56:20.720 --> 02:56:22.988
MATT: (defeated) Technically, yes.

02:56:22.988 --> 02:56:30.131
TALIESIN: That was the saddest advantage I've ever
seen.

02:56:30.131 --> 02:56:31.321
LAURA: Perception, you said?

02:56:31.321 --> 02:56:32.105
MATT: Yes.

02:56:32.105 --> 02:56:33.249
LAURA: That's a 20.

02:56:33.249 --> 02:56:37.689
MATT: Okay. As you walk towards the Birth Heart,
and you get towards the outside of this large

02:56:37.689 --> 02:56:45.074
cluster of towering trees, you do not see anything
that would be a tombstone per se.

02:56:45.074 --> 02:56:48.635
Occasionally you do see a cluster of stones.

02:56:48.635 --> 02:56:51.273
LAURA: Can I check 'em out and see if it looks
like--

02:56:51.273 --> 02:57:00.715
MATT: Yeah, make an investigation check.

02:57:00.715 --> 02:57:01.636
LAURA: What?

02:57:01.636 --> 02:57:02.799
TRAVIS: Why's your binder closed?

02:57:02.799 --> 02:57:09.053
LAURA: Well, I'm trying to take up less space
'cause we, you know? What was the first one?

02:57:09.053 --> 02:57:10.551
LIAM: Eight. They were both dogshit.

02:57:10.551 --> 02:57:11.436
LAURA: 15.

02:57:11.436 --> 02:57:12.924
MATT: 15, okay.

02:57:12.924 --> 02:57:14.822
LAURA: Shut up.

02:57:14.822 --> 02:57:19.567
MATT: Looking at the rocks that are here, there
are not a lot of errant stones here.

02:57:19.567 --> 02:57:31.195
Some occasional natural stones, but there is a 
thick kind of naturally composting pine and

02:57:31.195 --> 02:57:36.434
leaves that fall on this area that regenerate the 
cycle of fertility here as part of the

02:57:36.434 --> 02:57:41.020
enchantment. These stones are deliberately 
placed and are placed in a circular pattern

02:57:41.020 --> 02:57:44.676
with a pile in the center. It does appear to be 
a marking of some kind.

02:57:44.676 --> 02:57:47.857
LAURA: All right.

02:57:47.857 --> 02:57:49.274
TRAVIS: What's that?

02:57:49.274 --> 02:57:52.139
LAURA: I don't know. It looks like it could be a
marker,

02:57:52.139 --> 02:57:55.478
a tombstone, memorial, something like
that.

02:57:55.478 --> 02:57:57.360
TRAVIS: Do we have to make one that looks like
that?

02:57:57.360 --> 02:58:00.307
LAURA: We could.

02:58:00.307 --> 02:58:02.983
TRAVIS: Okay.

02:58:02.983 --> 02:58:08.876
LIAM: Is it in the exact center of this big area
of the trees?

02:58:08.876 --> 02:58:12.382
MATT: You're unable to see from this perspective,
you don't have an aerial view.

02:58:12.382 --> 02:58:17.468
LIAM: Oh, all right. But I mean, is it deep in or
is it just as we come in?

02:58:17.468 --> 02:58:21.081
MATT: It's not terribly deep. If you guys have
reached the outside of the Birth Heart, you've

02:58:21.081 --> 02:58:27.313
been walking for maybe ten minutes, it's not,
you're not entirely certain how far you are from

02:58:27.313 --> 02:58:31.845
the outskirts of the Abundant Terrace. You haven't
really walked through it before, you've seen it

02:58:31.845 --> 02:58:38.606
from a distance. Keyleth did one pass on it when
you first came to Vasselheim for the second time.

02:58:38.606 --> 02:58:40.892
You really have no idea where you are within the
city.

02:58:40.892 --> 02:58:48.330
LIAM: Do I get a vibe off of it, like it's a place
where others have been buried before?

02:58:48.330 --> 02:58:54.386
MATT: Make a wisdom check.

02:58:54.386 --> 02:58:57.689
LIAM: I'll use Luck.

02:58:57.689 --> 02:58:59.143
LAURA: That's cocked, that's cocked.

02:58:59.143 --> 02:58:59.700
LIAM: Sure.

02:58:59.700 --> 02:59:00.955
MATT: Nope.

02:59:00.955 --> 02:59:04.442
LIAM: All right. It was a tiny bit. Eight.

02:59:04.442 --> 02:59:06.413
MATT: If you can read the number, it's not.

02:59:06.413 --> 02:59:07.632
LAURA: Okay.

02:59:07.632 --> 02:59:12.448
LIAM: What does it say?

02:59:12.448 --> 02:59:20.535
MATT: Yeah, you get the sense, I mean, it's
awe-inspiring to be in this giant canopy of trees.

02:59:20.535 --> 02:59:26.448
It's hard to tell from this distance, but it's
probably hundreds of feet across from end to end,

02:59:26.448 --> 02:59:32.025
and it's beautiful. There is, once again you can
see trees up on the mountain that Vasselheim is

02:59:32.025 --> 02:59:37.923
built on the base of, and you can see distant
clusters of pine that are all covered in snow.

02:59:37.923 --> 02:59:43.701
There should be snowfall on these trees to a
certain extent, ice gathering at some point in the

02:59:43.701 --> 02:59:49.123
boughs, and it is just verdant green, untouched by
frost or snow.

02:59:49.123 --> 02:59:53.775
MARISHA: Does there seem to be one central tree in
the center of all this, or just a massive--

02:59:53.775 --> 02:59:56.930
MATT: It's hard to tell from this outside. You'd
have to walk into the Birth Heart to see.

02:59:56.930 --> 02:59:57.956
LAURA: Let's do it.

02:59:57.956 --> 03:00:01.499
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I thought we already
were doing that.

03:00:01.499 --> 03:00:06.112
MATT: As you enter the Birth Heart, it's an
archway of branches and trees that knit into each

03:00:06.112 --> 03:00:13.795
other and wrap around as you step in. You can see
what looks like a heavy cluster of forest is

03:00:13.795 --> 03:00:22.485
really just an outside row of trees that are all
intertwined. The inside is open with the

03:00:22.485 --> 03:00:27.380
occasional stalk of tree that blossoms up into the
higher portion.

03:00:27.380 --> 03:00:32.024
There is one large central tree in
the center of the area that marks--

03:00:32.024 --> 03:00:33.483
MARISHA: The Birth Heart.

03:00:33.483 --> 03:00:35.875
MATT: This is the center of the Birth Heart.

03:00:35.875 --> 03:00:40.441
And within there are a number of lanterns 
that are hung from the branches all throughout--

03:00:40.441 --> 03:00:42.746
LAURA: It's beautiful!

03:00:42.746 --> 03:00:45.302
MATT: &nbsp;-- that all have their own yellowish fairy
glow within each point.

03:00:45.302 --> 03:00:47.735
They're all through the inside at different levels.

03:00:47.793 --> 03:00:49.055
MARISHA: Shut up, don't judge us!

03:00:49.055 --> 03:00:51.780
MATT: It's just hundreds and hundreds of these
yellow glowing lights that are hooked up into the

03:00:51.780 --> 03:01:04.834
boughs ahead. There are a number of people walking
off the path, just through the soft mulch wood and

03:01:04.834 --> 03:01:12.656
dying pine soft floor of the canopy, all wearing
similar robes of greens and yellows, golds and

03:01:12.656 --> 03:01:18.570
whites. You recognize these as similar signs of
followers, priests--

03:01:18.570 --> 03:01:19.689
MARISHA: Of Melora?

03:01:19.689 --> 03:01:21.604
MATT: -- and people who are worshipers of Melora.

03:01:21.604 --> 03:01:23.408
MARISHA: Oh shit, all right.

03:01:23.408 --> 03:01:28.034
MATT: The central tree does have a number of
staircases that spiral up. At certain points there

03:01:28.034 --> 03:01:37.418
look to be windows and holes throughout. The
inside gives a warm glow from the interior and you

03:01:37.418 --> 03:01:42.032
can already see dozens of people gathered around
the outside at tables talking.

03:01:42.032 --> 03:01:44.289
TRAVIS: (whispering) It's a cafe.

03:01:44.289 --> 03:01:45.821
MATT: (laughs) There's no cafe, necessarily.

03:01:45.821 --> 03:01:47.165
(all laugh)

03:01:47.165 --> 03:01:48.773
LIAM: But there is a gift shop!

03:01:48.773 --> 03:01:50.678
MARISHA: There's a Starbucks!

03:01:50.678 --> 03:01:53.895
MATT: But there is a surprisingly-- I won't say
vibrant social atmosphere, but there are places

03:01:53.895 --> 03:01:57.101
where people are congregating here to have soft
conversations.

03:01:57.101 --> 03:01:58.672
LAURA: Are they all holy or is this like--

03:01:58.672 --> 03:01:59.751
MATT: Some of them are, some of them aren't.

03:01:59.751 --> 03:02:00.644
LAURA: Okay.

03:02:00.644 --> 03:02:05.153
MATT: It's a smattering of individuals.

03:02:05.153 --> 03:02:06.697
LAURA: &nbsp;This is beautiful!

03:02:06.697 --> 03:02:08.813
MARISHA: I know! This is so romantical!

03:02:08.813 --> 03:02:12.054
TRAVIS: (mimics throwing up)

03:02:12.054 --> 03:02:19.138
MARISHA: I go up to one of the worshipers of
Melora.

03:02:19.138 --> 03:02:31.629
MATT: Okay. There is an older woman, her hair
starts red and goes to grey. Best you can tell,

03:02:31.629 --> 03:02:39.115
her heritage is human, but she is a little thicker
and more muscular than most women of her age that

03:02:39.115 --> 03:02:51.054
you've come across. Her skin is weathered from
sunlight and harsh seasons, but she smiles as you

03:02:51.054 --> 03:02:59.282
approach and her eyes, one looks to be a little
cataract-ridden but the other one is a beautiful

03:02:59.282 --> 03:03:06.003
clear blue color, and both of them meet with yours
as you approach and she smiles.

03:03:06.003 --> 03:03:08.464
"Ah, can I help you?"

03:03:08.464 --> 03:03:13.492
MARISHA: Oh hello, I am Keyleth of the Air Ashari.
What's your name?

03:03:13.492 --> 03:03:15.511
MATT: Lamor. It's nice to meet you.

03:03:15.511 --> 03:03:21.819
MARISHA: Lamor, pleasure to meet you. I was just
curious-- Lamor?

03:03:21.819 --> 03:03:23.109
MATT: Yes, Lamor.

03:03:23.109 --> 03:03:24.194
MARISHA: I want to write this down before I
forget.

03:03:24.194 --> 03:03:25.225
MATT: L a m o r.

03:03:25.225 --> 03:03:26.007
MARISHA: Uh what?

03:03:26.007 --> 03:03:27.878
MATT: L a m o r.

03:03:27.878 --> 03:03:41.182
MARISHA: L a m o r. Okay. I was just curious. We
are here to pay our respects and to do a favor for

03:03:41.182 --> 03:03:49.605
a friend and bury his fallen wife. Is there a
specific place where we can do that and spread the

03:03:49.605 --> 03:04:00.099
ashes in a respectful manner. Below the Birth
Heart tree? I just don't want disturb the grounds.

03:04:00.099 --> 03:04:09.326
MATT: I mean, to return to the earth is a sacred
offering. From what you were given life is to give

03:04:09.326 --> 03:04:18.925
life once more. You would need a witness. I could
witness for you, if you'd prefer?

03:04:18.925 --> 03:04:20.532
MARISHA: Really?

03:04:20.532 --> 03:04:23.162
MATT: Just to make sure that there's no funny
business, of course.

03:04:23.162 --> 03:04:28.089
MARISHA: Of course. I have no problems with that.

03:04:28.089 --> 03:04:28.798
LAURA: No.

03:04:28.798 --> 03:04:29.629
MARISHA No problems with that?

03:04:29.629 --> 03:04:30.512
TALIESIN: I think it's a great idea.

03:04:30.512 --> 03:04:31.804
LAURA: Solid.

03:04:31.804 --> 03:04:38.948
MATT: Um, find a place of your choosing. I will
come as well.

03:04:38.948 --> 03:04:45.815
MARISHA: Thank you. Do you have any suggestions?
Kind of new to this.

03:04:45.815 --> 03:04:50.623
LAURA: Anything with orange flowers around? I feel
like Senokir would like orange flowers.

03:04:50.623 --> 03:04:59.135
MATT: Not much in the way of blooming flowers of
color in the Birth Heart.

03:04:59.135 --> 03:05:04.764
ASHLEY: Is it better to open a box and put the
ashes out or is it--

03:05:04.764 --> 03:05:07.584
MATT: That depends on the interred.

03:05:07.584 --> 03:05:16.817
I mean, whatever the wishes are of the 
one you've lost, but that's--

03:05:16.817 --> 03:05:21.002
TRAVIS: Should we ask if maybe she knows
her, the name?

03:05:21.002 --> 03:05:27.744
LAURA: Oh, yeah. Did you happen to know a woman
named Zaa... Zaafin--

03:05:27.744 --> 03:05:29.374
(laughter)

03:05:29.374 --> 03:05:34.511
LAURA: I literally was thinking "so fine" in my
head and I was trying to remember.

03:05:34.511 --> 03:05:38.370
MATT: I'm afraid I don't know that name, I'm
sorry.

03:05:38.370 --> 03:05:40.952
LAURA: She was a big fan of this place.

03:05:40.952 --> 03:05:42.936
MARISHA: One of her favorite locations.

03:05:42.936 --> 03:05:44.706
MATT: That's very sweet.

03:05:44.706 --> 03:05:47.059
MARISHA: Yeah. Okay, well, I think we would just

03:05:47.059 --> 03:05:54.941
like to bury the box without disturbing the box,
right guys?

03:05:54.941 --> 03:05:55.908
LAURA: Probably.

03:05:55.908 --> 03:05:57.148
TRAVIS: Yeah, just put the box in there.

03:05:57.148 --> 03:05:57.862
MARISHA: Okay.

03:05:57.862 --> 03:05:58.899
LIAM: Yes.

03:05:58.899 --> 03:05:59.762
LAURA: Probably.

03:05:59.762 --> 03:06:02.410
MATT: (laughs) She's looking a little awkward from
all this conversation.

03:06:02.410 --> 03:06:03.881
LAURA: We've never buried ashes before.

03:06:03.881 --> 03:06:05.288
TALIESIN: We've had a very long week.

03:06:05.288 --> 03:06:06.731
MARISHA: Yes.

03:06:06.731 --> 03:06:09.130
MATT: You do look a bit worse for wear.

03:06:09.130 --> 03:06:10.620
LIAM: A couple of months, actually.

03:06:10.620 --> 03:06:14.655
MATT: Well, decide on a location of your choosing.

03:06:14.655 --> 03:06:18.054
We will have to keep vigil over it for a short
time.

03:06:18.054 --> 03:06:19.236
LAURA: Great, that's wonderful!

03:06:19.236 --> 03:06:20.432
MARISHA: That's great yes.

03:06:20.432 --> 03:06:21.438
TALIESIN: Excellent.

03:06:21.438 --> 03:06:26.308
MATT: If there is anything found that is not
approved within the Birth Heart,

03:06:26.308 --> 03:06:28.717
it will be excised and removed from 
the premises.

03:06:28.717 --> 03:06:29.611
MARISHA: Great!

03:06:29.611 --> 03:06:30.900
MATT: No disrespect meant.

03:06:30.900 --> 03:06:34.230
LAURA: (clicks her tongue) None taken.

03:06:34.230 --> 03:06:43.756
TRAVIS: Question. What sort of thing would
represent an unwelcome burial?

03:06:43.756 --> 03:06:48.126
MATT: Anything that's not the remains of an
individual like you've promised they are?

03:06:48.126 --> 03:06:51.989
TRAVIS: Oh, right, yeah. Like foreign seeds or
something?

03:06:51.989 --> 03:06:53.251
MATT: Very much so.

03:06:53.251 --> 03:06:55.468
TRAVIS: Agriculture control, very important.

03:06:55.468 --> 03:06:57.711
LAURA: Bad, bad, very bad.

03:06:57.711 --> 03:07:01.067
LIAM: There are flowers here, aren't there?

03:07:01.067 --> 03:07:04.792
MATT: I mean, simple wildflowers, yes.

03:07:04.792 --> 03:07:09.073
LIAM: Lead the way, please. Whatever is closest.

03:07:09.073 --> 03:07:09.824
MATT: All right.

03:07:09.824 --> 03:07:10.539
LIAM: Thank you.

03:07:10.539 --> 03:07:11.744
MATT: "All right. Follow me."

03:07:11.744 --> 03:07:18.271
She turns around, and she looks not 
mistrusting, but definitely a little confused.

03:07:18.271 --> 03:07:24.415
She brings you to the edge of this pathway 
and you can see there is a nice, smooth-packed

03:07:24.415 --> 03:07:30.163
dirt walk that's well kept, and you can see 
occasionally a few of the priests come through

03:07:30.163 --> 03:07:35.170
with these very fine rake-like brooms that 
they pull through like a very fine zen garden, and

03:07:35.170 --> 03:07:39.571
it rakes the earth as they go through and it helps
then pack it as they walk.

03:07:39.571 --> 03:07:42.089
LIAM: As we walked over here, I turned around to
the group and went--

03:07:42.089 --> 03:07:47.078
(all laugh)

03:07:47.078 --> 03:07:53.194
MATT: She brings you to the edge where the dirt
ends, and you can see the underbrush and greenery

03:07:53.194 --> 03:07:58.844
continues. She steps into it and you watch as each
foot comes down, as you would when you walk

03:07:58.844 --> 03:08:08.516
through a densely wooded area, with each crush of
a plant or a brush or a stick or twig as it

03:08:08.516 --> 03:08:19.874
breaks, it mends itself immediately after she
steps past it. She leads you maybe 70 feet off the

03:08:19.874 --> 03:08:28.423
path, past a couple of the central trees that are
dappled throughout this area. In one spot, you can

03:08:28.423 --> 03:08:31.538
see these faint whitish-grey flowers that are

03:08:31.538 --> 03:08:34.119
gathering in clusters around the base of a tree
here.

03:08:34.119 --> 03:08:34.723
LAURA: That's nice.

03:08:34.723 --> 03:08:36.961
LIAM: &nbsp;This looks perfect.

03:08:36.961 --> 03:08:38.709
MATT: Well, it is yours to do.

03:08:38.709 --> 03:08:41.619
LAURA: Does the Birth Heart have healing
properties?

03:08:41.619 --> 03:08:48.287
MATT: The Birth Heart has many properties. The
guiding and blessings of Melora are strongest here

03:08:48.287 --> 03:08:56.891
than anywhere on Exandria, and here her presence
is felt even beyond the divine gate.

03:08:56.891 --> 03:08:59.426
LIAM: Pike, this feels right.

03:08:59.426 --> 03:09:01.700
LAURA: Right?

03:09:01.700 --> 03:09:02.651
ASHLEY: It does?

03:09:02.651 --> 03:09:04.815
LIAM: Yes, it does.

03:09:04.815 --> 03:09:06.838
LAURA: Does it?

03:09:06.838 --> 03:09:19.939
MARISHA: Okay, look, I feel like this is an
exercise in simplicity for us, and trust, right?

03:09:19.939 --> 03:09:20.750
LAURA: Yeah.

03:09:20.750 --> 03:09:21.545
MARISHA: Right?

03:09:21.545 --> 03:09:24.076
TRAVIS: Sorry for all the questions. It's very
lovely here.

03:09:24.076 --> 03:09:24.711
MATT: Thank you.

03:09:24.711 --> 03:09:25.775
MARISHA: It's not you, it's us.

03:09:25.775 --> 03:09:26.880
LAURA: We're so weird.

03:09:26.880 --> 03:09:28.317
MARISHA: (sighs) We really are.

03:09:28.317 --> 03:09:31.089
MATT: I wasn't going to say it, but I'm glad you
brought it up.

03:09:31.089 --> 03:09:37.303
LIAM: Pike, would you bring the box over here,
please? Would you pray with me, please?

03:09:37.303 --> 03:09:40.505
ASHLEY: Well, I-- Matt, can I ask you a question?

03:09:40.505 --> 03:09:42.816
(all laugh)

03:09:42.816 --> 03:09:44.648
MATT: Yeah, yes you may, Ashley.

03:09:44.648 --> 03:09:45.934
TRAVIS: Holy shit!

03:09:45.934 --> 03:09:47.143
LAURA: That got serious!

03:09:47.143 --> 03:09:49.299
TRAVIS: Oh, legit!

03:09:49.299 --> 03:09:51.702
ASHLEY: Is it respectful to--

03:09:51.702 --> 03:09:52.942
LIAM: Spike the box!

03:09:52.942 --> 03:09:57.437
ASHLEY: -- when you're at a place of another god's
worship to--

03:09:57.437 --> 03:10:04.155
I know we did at the resurrection
ritual, but to bring another god into it?

03:10:04.155 --> 03:10:10.499
MATT: Roll a religion check.

03:10:10.499 --> 03:10:14.249
ASHLEY: Oh, fuck it. Do I get advantage?

03:10:14.249 --> 03:10:17.439
MATT: No. You have no idea.

03:10:17.439 --> 03:10:18.715
ASHLEY: I have no idea.

03:10:18.715 --> 03:10:22.624
MATT: You've spent some time in Vasselheim, but
it's always been focused around your temple and

03:10:22.624 --> 03:10:26.430
the reconstruction of Sarenrae's temple. You have
spent very little time studying the other

03:10:26.430 --> 03:10:32.960
religions around you and what that sort of
situation would entail, so you have no clue.

03:10:32.960 --> 03:10:36.956
MARISHA: Wait, did you say something about a
resurrection? You didn't say that, did you?

03:10:36.956 --> 03:10:38.126
ASHLEY: I was just saying 'cause--

03:10:38.126 --> 03:10:39.668
TRAVIS: The resurrection was both the Raven Queen
and--

03:10:39.668 --> 03:10:42.317
ASHLEY:-- was in the Raven Queen, but we were
using Sarenrae as well.

03:10:42.317 --> 03:10:44.812
MATT: Yeah, so the crossing over of the deities'
influence

03:10:44.812 --> 03:10:46.682
in the space is what she was inquiring
about.

03:10:46.682 --> 03:10:47.782
MARISHA: Right.

03:10:47.782 --> 03:10:49.939
LAURA: Some deities might like each other more
than other deities though.

03:10:49.939 --> 03:10:51.426
TALIESIN: That's very true, actually.

03:10:51.426 --> 03:10:52.786
LIAM: Ours are cool though.

03:10:52.786 --> 03:10:53.588
MARISHA: Yeah, totally.

03:10:53.588 --> 03:10:54.285
LIAM: Ours are--

03:10:54.285 --> 03:10:55.112
LAURA: --like besties.

03:10:55.112 --> 03:10:56.065
LIAM: Ours are besties.

03:10:56.065 --> 03:10:57.395
ASHLEY: I feel like Melora and Sarenrae--

03:10:57.395 --> 03:10:59.007
MARISHA: They might be chummy!

03:10:59.007 --> 03:11:00.565
TALIESIN: Or so similar that it might be a
problem?

03:11:00.565 --> 03:11:01.664
LIAM: Yeah.

03:11:01.664 --> 03:11:02.463
MARISHA: Well...

03:11:02.463 --> 03:11:03.531
TRAVIS: This is kind of her spot--

03:11:03.531 --> 03:11:04.912
LIAM: Makes sense on the surface--

03:11:04.912 --> 03:11:07.529
TALIESIN: It's just, there's a lot of clash.

03:11:07.529 --> 03:11:12.033
MARISHA: Well, Melora's more neutral. She's more,
nature is--

03:11:12.033 --> 03:11:13.157
TRAVIS: Earth tone?

03:11:13.157 --> 03:11:17.100
MARISHA: Earth tones, you know. Fall colors.

03:11:17.100 --> 03:11:20.863
LIAM: I know that we're all really fucking worn
out,

03:11:20.863 --> 03:11:24.941
but I would like to not cheapen this moment
any more than we maybe already have.

03:11:24.941 --> 03:11:30.038
MARISHA: Guys, when we set out to do this, we
promised we were going to make this easy and

03:11:30.038 --> 03:11:34.200
simple and we can't even do that, we are torturing
ourselves, we are--

03:11:34.200 --> 03:11:35.389
TRAVIS: You're-- you're getting a little--

03:11:35.389 --> 03:11:36.583
MARISHA: -- making this far more complicated--

03:11:36.583 --> 03:11:37.588
LAURA: Whoa, let's stop. Let's stop. Let's just--

03:11:37.588 --> 03:11:38.474
MARISHA: Okay.

03:11:38.474 --> 03:11:40.550
LAURA: -- bury these ashes.

03:11:40.550 --> 03:11:41.908
ASHLEY: Percy?

03:11:41.908 --> 03:11:44.191
TALIESIN: I'm keeping my mouth so shut.

03:11:44.191 --> 03:11:53.758
MARISHA: Okay, look. All right. Pike. If you want,
before we do this, I could do a Commune with

03:11:53.758 --> 03:12:00.392
Nature? And maybe study the lands and see if I
could maybe connect with Melora?

03:12:00.392 --> 03:12:03.480
Maybe through my Spire? If you want.

03:12:03.480 --> 03:12:04.815
TRAVIS: Put the box in the ground.

03:12:04.815 --> 03:12:08.201
MARISHA: Okay, or we could just put the box in the
ground, Jesus.

03:12:08.201 --> 03:12:11.008
ASHLEY: All right, well, are we going to dig a
hole or we just--

03:12:11.008 --> 03:12:13.670
LAURA: Is it all right if we dig a hole?

03:12:13.670 --> 03:12:15.577
MATT: I imagine so, yes.

03:12:15.577 --> 03:12:16.409
LAURA: All right.

03:12:16.409 --> 03:12:18.203
MATT: "All right."

03:12:18.203 --> 03:12:19.922
So, you get down to dig a hole?

03:12:19.922 --> 03:12:21.129
LAURA: Sure!

03:12:21.129 --> 03:12:23.112
MATT: It's soft. The ground is pretty malleable,
actually.

03:12:23.112 --> 03:12:25.783
Not like clay, but the dirt isn't
densely packed in this portion.

03:12:25.783 --> 03:12:27.178
LAURA: As I'm doing it, I'm like,

03:12:27.178 --> 03:12:33.494
Melora, you were clutch in the fight against 
Raishan and we appreciate it greatly.

03:12:33.494 --> 03:12:37.571
Thank you for everything
you've done for us. Your trees are beautiful.

03:12:37.571 --> 03:12:40.919
MATT: (laughs)

03:12:40.919 --> 03:12:43.263
ASHLEY: So, we don't know what we're planting
here,

03:12:43.263 --> 03:12:45.545
so if it's something bad it's not our
fault--

03:12:45.545 --> 03:12:47.126
(all laugh)

03:12:47.126 --> 03:12:50.320
ASHLEY: Side note.

03:12:50.320 --> 03:12:51.836
LAURA: Are you talking to the dirt?

03:12:51.836 --> 03:12:53.606
ASHLEY: I'm talking to Melora through the dirt.

03:12:53.606 --> 03:12:54.687
MARISHA: You just put, like, a

03:12:54.687 --> 03:12:57.802
"we are not responsible for any damages"
clause into the contract.

03:12:57.802 --> 03:13:02.103
LIAM: Um, I am smirking, but trying to pray to the
Raven Queen.

03:13:02.103 --> 03:13:06.208
MATT: Okay. You place the box in?

03:13:06.208 --> 03:13:09.712
ASHLEY: Augh. Yes.

03:13:09.712 --> 03:13:10.510
MATT: Okay.

03:13:10.510 --> 03:13:11.777
LAURA: (laughs)

03:13:11.777 --> 03:13:12.863
MATT: You rest-- you rest the box down--

03:13:12.863 --> 03:13:13.606
ASHLEY: My precious--

03:13:13.606 --> 03:13:16.833
(all laugh)

03:13:16.833 --> 03:13:17.771
ASHLEY: It doesn't feel right!

03:13:17.771 --> 03:13:19.170
TRAVIS: (like Gollum) Why should I?

03:13:19.170 --> 03:13:23.857
MATT: -- into the hole freshly dug by Vex.

03:13:23.857 --> 03:13:27.141
LAURA: I'm gonna cover it. It's getting covered.

03:13:27.141 --> 03:13:33.252
MATT: Vex covers it. Takes the dirt, pats it.
(pats down) There, the flowers arranged naturally

03:13:33.252 --> 03:13:40.657
across the tree trunk and the growth surrounding
it. The woman clasps her hands together.

03:13:40.657 --> 03:13:45.311
"Very well. Now, if you please--"

03:13:45.311 --> 03:13:48.079
MARISHA: Would it be okay if I just picked a
couple flowers

03:13:48.079 --> 03:13:53.812
to press and take with me for
remembrance?

03:13:53.812 --> 03:13:58.799
MATT: She reaches over and (click noises).

03:13:58.799 --> 03:14:00.100
"There you are, child."

03:14:00.100 --> 03:14:01.243
MARISHA: Thank you.

03:14:01.243 --> 03:14:04.839
MATT: Now, um. Business is done.

03:14:04.839 --> 03:14:08.841
LAURA: Could we leave a marker of some sort? So we
know exactly where we left her.

03:14:08.841 --> 03:14:10.845
MATT: What would you wish to leave?

03:14:10.845 --> 03:14:17.577
LAURA: I saw earlier circles of stones. Is that
traditional?

03:14:17.577 --> 03:14:20.712
MATT: Depends on your background, of course, if
that's what you prefer.

03:14:20.712 --> 03:14:27.069
We wish nothing with names or engravings. The 
memory is kept by Melora and the presence

03:14:27.069 --> 03:14:30.412
of nature in its own. So, a marker
or--

03:14:30.412 --> 03:14:33.291
LAURA: Can you think of anything Senokir would've
appreciated?

03:14:33.291 --> 03:14:36.616
TALIESIN: I think knowing his work is underground
may be enough.

03:14:36.616 --> 03:14:39.437
MARISHA: I could Stone Shape something simple.

03:14:39.437 --> 03:14:42.448
LAURA: Maybe a ring? He's a jeweler.

03:14:42.448 --> 03:14:43.158
MARISHA: That's true.

03:14:43.158 --> 03:14:44.596
LAURA: It was his wife.

03:14:44.596 --> 03:14:49.610
MARISHA: That's true. I out of the ground Stone
Shape

03:14:49.610 --> 03:14:54.560
what looks like a simplistic fire branded
wedding band.

03:14:54.560 --> 03:15:00.850
MATT: You watch as the earth off to the side of
where you buried the box shakes and a single

03:15:00.850 --> 03:15:06.208
stone, roughly that big, (shaking ground sounds)
finds its way to the surface, like a localized

03:15:06.208 --> 03:15:13.445
earthquake. And as it hits the top, it (cracks)
splits and shapes into a circular band, and then

03:15:13.445 --> 03:15:18.370
falls on the side and rests there for a moment on
top of the dirt pile.

03:15:18.370 --> 03:15:19.206
LAURA: That's perfect.

03:15:19.206 --> 03:15:20.336
LIAM: That's cool.

03:15:20.336 --> 03:15:25.235
MARISHA: Okay. (lets out a deep breath)

03:15:25.235 --> 03:15:30.961
TRAVIS: Thank you for, um, this.

03:15:30.961 --> 03:15:35.761
MATT: I will remain vigil over this.

03:15:35.761 --> 03:15:39.691
You may take your walk up the Birth 
Heart or the rest of Vasselheim.

03:15:39.691 --> 03:15:40.880
LAURA: Oh, thank you.

03:15:40.880 --> 03:15:42.683
TALIESIN: Thank you.

03:15:42.683 --> 03:15:46.907
LAURA: Can we go in? Can we go up and look, or? Is
it like--

03:15:46.907 --> 03:15:53.195
MATT: Well, you would have to speak with the
priests. It's not necessarily an open--

03:15:53.195 --> 03:15:55.437
TRAVIS: It's not the Swiss Family Robinson tree
house.

03:15:55.437 --> 03:15:57.006
LAURA: It's just beautiful, I don't think I've
ever seen--

03:15:57.006 --> 03:16:00.172
MARISHA: Who are the priests?

03:16:00.172 --> 03:16:03.172
MATT: Any of the individuals in similar garb, but

03:16:03.172 --> 03:16:08.350
they have a series of golden rings around their
neck, at the base of the tree.

03:16:08.350 --> 03:16:16.041
MARISHA: I was just curious because, you see, I
have this staff that has Melora's marking on it.

03:16:16.041 --> 03:16:20.443
MATT: She takes a moment, reaches for it. (gasps)

03:16:20.443 --> 03:16:21.497
MARISHA: Wow, that's--

03:16:21.497 --> 03:16:22.738
LAURA: We should've led with that.

03:16:22.738 --> 03:16:27.751
MARISHA: You know, that's quite a reaction. I
wasn't expecting that.

03:16:27.751 --> 03:16:32.343
MATT: This-- where did you-- how? Where did you
come across such an artifact?

03:16:32.343 --> 03:16:37.593
MARISHA: I found it through a series of very hard
and troubling events and circumstances.

03:16:37.593 --> 03:16:39.651
TALIESIN: (laughs)

03:16:39.651 --> 03:16:48.602
MATT: I can only understand that. What you hold in
your hand is one of the great relics of Melora.

03:16:48.602 --> 03:16:52.841
MARISHA: Okay.

03:16:52.841 --> 03:16:57.529
MATT: I must remain as I've chosen my vigil
already,

03:16:57.529 --> 03:17:04.123
but if you would do the honor of the
Birth Heart of having that returned to the

03:17:04.123 --> 03:17:09.903
priestesses of Melora that would be of a great aid
to our people.

03:17:09.903 --> 03:17:11.732
MARISHA: (inhales sharply)

03:17:11.732 --> 03:17:19.141
(all laugh)

03:17:19.141 --> 03:17:20.632
LIAM: He just did that.

03:17:20.632 --> 03:17:22.375
MARISHA: (laughing) Fuck you, Travis.

03:17:22.375 --> 03:17:24.468
TALIESIN: Woooow.

03:17:24.468 --> 03:17:30.014
LAURA: (through her bottle) That's why you keep
things hidden.

03:17:30.014 --> 03:17:31.597
MATT: "It's--"

03:17:31.597 --> 03:17:34.141
And she reaches out and runs her
finger along the side and is like--

03:17:34.141 --> 03:17:39.411
MARISHA: Yeah, okay, you know, that's enough.
That's enough touching.

03:17:39.411 --> 03:17:47.158
MATT: A magic, a force as potent in that. You're
blessed to have found it.

03:17:47.158 --> 03:17:49.895
LAURA: She's aided us greatly.

03:17:49.895 --> 03:17:52.036
MATT: As she does us all.

03:17:52.036 --> 03:18:03.606
MARISHA: What if her aid-- (clears throat) What if
her aid was best used--

03:18:03.606 --> 03:18:05.076
LAURA: Protecting the world--

03:18:05.076 --> 03:18:08.155
MARISHA: -- in the world. And not maybe in a
museum.

03:18:08.155 --> 03:18:11.311
MATT: That is your choice, not mine.

03:18:11.311 --> 03:18:13.733
TALIESIN: I think perhaps there will come a time,

03:18:13.733 --> 03:18:17.510
but that it is not yet time to put the staff to
rest.

03:18:17.510 --> 03:18:21.181
MARISHA: Look-- (sighs painfully)

03:18:21.181 --> 03:18:31.323
TRAVIS: Wow. Just walk away. Walk away.

03:18:31.323 --> 03:18:38.957
MARISHA: You know, I don't want to hold on to
anything if it doesn't rightfully belong to me,

03:18:38.957 --> 03:18:44.716
but this has also been lost for a long time. So
who does it rightfully belong to?

03:18:44.716 --> 03:18:47.195
And I'm trying to do good with it.

03:18:47.195 --> 03:18:49.211
MATT: (shushes) She reaches out and touches your
forehead.

03:18:49.211 --> 03:18:52.068
MARISHA: Okay. I just-- I don't wanna--

03:18:52.068 --> 03:18:55.734
MATT: It's all right. We mean not to take it from
you.

03:18:55.734 --> 03:18:56.967
MARISHA: Uh-huh.

03:18:56.967 --> 03:19:03.167
MATT: If it still has purpose in your hands, keep
it. Keep it safe. Do not lose it as you say it was

03:19:03.167 --> 03:19:16.918
once lost. And when you find the need for such
power no longer necessary, then return it.

03:19:16.918 --> 03:19:23.277
MARISHA: I promise you I will.

03:19:23.277 --> 03:19:29.967
And I'm very grateful, and I do feel very blessed 
that I found it and that I have this power.

03:19:29.967 --> 03:19:36.732
MATT: Then use it to spread her love. Use it to
spread her comfort and protection.

03:19:36.732 --> 03:19:42.117
LAURA: Champion of Melora! I see it now.

03:19:42.117 --> 03:19:47.784
MARISHA: You know-- (sighs)

03:19:47.784 --> 03:19:49.126
TRAVIS: Oh, shit.

03:19:49.126 --> 03:19:57.873
MARISHA: Is there a way? 'Cause you see, I'm not
great with the gods, but I've never really spoken

03:19:57.873 --> 03:20:05.725
to Melora. I have a lot of friends who are very
much supporters of her.

03:20:05.725 --> 03:20:11.217
Is there something I could
do to show my thanks?

03:20:11.217 --> 03:20:14.534
MATT: I think that the fact that you still hold
that to this day means that her favor smiles on

03:20:14.534 --> 03:20:23.862
you. If you walk the path she rides, maybe you'll
find a way to talk with her yourself. But there is

03:20:23.862 --> 03:20:35.615
no key, there is no trick, there is no secret. She
speaks through the growing buds of the flowers

03:20:35.615 --> 03:20:42.188
below, she speaks through the rain that comes and
brings water to them to grow. I'm sure she's

03:20:42.188 --> 03:20:54.518
spoken to you most of your life. Maybe now your
ears are open to listen.

03:20:54.518 --> 03:20:57.924
MARISHA: Thank you, Lamor.

03:20:57.924 --> 03:20:59.061
MATT: You're welcome.

03:20:59.061 --> 03:21:01.063
MARISHA: I will not forget your words.

03:21:01.063 --> 03:21:08.378
MATT: I hope not. There is great wisdom in that
staff, as there is great wisdom in you.

03:21:08.378 --> 03:21:12.068
MARISHA: (exhales) Okay.

03:21:12.068 --> 03:21:15.914
MATT: You doubt yourself too much, child.

03:21:15.914 --> 03:21:20.588
MARISHA: People keep telling me that. Okay. All
right. Thank you. Thank you.

03:21:20.588 --> 03:21:26.124
MATT: She takes your hand and cups it into both of
hers and holds it for a second.

03:21:26.124 --> 03:21:29.527
MARISHA: (whispers) I'm so conflicted. Thank you.
Okay, bye.

03:21:29.527 --> 03:21:31.476
MATT: Aren't we all.

03:21:31.476 --> 03:21:33.071
TRAVIS: Do we get to leave the arboretum now?

03:21:33.071 --> 03:21:36.093
(everyone laughs)

03:21:36.093 --> 03:21:38.176
LAURA: It was beautiful, though, while it lasted.

03:21:38.176 --> 03:21:39.409
ASHLEY: It's so beautiful.

03:21:39.409 --> 03:21:41.322
TRAVIS: I stepped on this toadstool and I'm afraid
to tell someone.

03:21:41.322 --> 03:21:42.952
(everyone laughs)

03:21:42.952 --> 03:21:44.331
LAURA: I think it'll grow back, Grog.

03:21:44.331 --> 03:21:45.671
ASHLEY: Yeah, take your foot off and watch.

03:21:45.671 --> 03:21:48.141
TRAVIS: I can't. I'm scared, they're looking
really close.

03:21:48.141 --> 03:21:50.433
LIAM: Let's get her out of here before they change
their mind, alright? Yeah.

03:21:50.433 --> 03:21:51.134
LAURA: Yeah.

03:21:51.134 --> 03:21:52.675
MARISHA: Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah.

03:21:52.675 --> 03:21:55.633
TALIESIN: I could watch your moral panic all day,
it's so delightful.

03:21:55.633 --> 03:21:59.250
MARISHA: Shut up, Percy!

03:21:59.250 --> 03:22:02.076
MATT: As you guys make your way out of the Birth
Heart,

03:22:02.076 --> 03:22:06.604
into the Abundant Terrace, what do you wish
to do?

03:22:06.604 --> 03:22:12.845
TRAVIS: See, that was not such a big deal. All
that fuss for a box in the dirt.

03:22:12.845 --> 03:22:16.511
LAURA: Do we need to stock up on supplies?

03:22:16.511 --> 03:22:21.330
TRAVIS: Ooh, yeah. We haven't been to a right
proper store in a long time, right?

03:22:21.330 --> 03:22:27.521
LAURA: Yeah. Do you need to check in on the
temple?

03:22:27.521 --> 03:22:31.181
ASHLEY: Maybe, I don't know.

03:22:31.181 --> 03:22:32.530
TRAVIS: What's wrong with you?

03:22:32.530 --> 03:22:36.049
ASHLEY: I dunno, I just still feel weird about it.

03:22:36.049 --> 03:22:40.231
LIAM: You know, this might be a bit of a wild
hare, but watching you back there,

03:22:40.231 --> 03:22:41.990
I had a thought. Grog.

03:22:41.990 --> 03:22:43.371
TRAVIS: Yeah?

03:22:43.371 --> 03:22:47.586
LIAM: I mean, we've just had a really hard time
for weeks, months.

03:22:47.586 --> 03:22:55.954
It was fuckin' awful. You seem
a bit punchy. You wanna take her--

03:22:55.954 --> 03:22:59.646
TRAVIS: (gasps) Say it.

03:22:59.646 --> 03:23:01.095
LIAM: -- to the Crucible?

03:23:01.095 --> 03:23:02.255
TRAVIS: Oh, shit.

03:23:02.255 --> 03:23:04.525
LIAM: To let off a little bit of steam?

03:23:04.525 --> 03:23:06.268
ASHLEY: What's the Crucible?

03:23:06.268 --> 03:23:07.926
LAURA: (gasps)

03:23:07.926 --> 03:23:12.383
TRAVIS: Are you sure you weren't here? Were you
not?

03:23:12.383 --> 03:23:13.939
LIAM: Think she was off.

03:23:13.939 --> 03:23:15.791
MARISHA: I think she had just left.

03:23:15.791 --> 03:23:24.248
TRAVIS: Oh, that's right. The Crucible is a pit
fighting arena next to the temple of Kord, right?

03:23:24.248 --> 03:23:25.182
Around that area?

03:23:25.182 --> 03:23:26.308
MATT: In the Trial Forge, yeah.

03:23:26.308 --> 03:23:28.666
TRAVIS: In the Trial Forge. Yeah. One on one.

03:23:28.666 --> 03:23:31.031
LIAM: We know you are an angel, but we know that

03:23:31.031 --> 03:23:33.653
you also have a little bit of piss and vinegar in
you.

03:23:33.653 --> 03:23:34.730
TRAVIS: No weapons.

03:23:34.730 --> 03:23:35.902
ASHLEY: Yeah-- No weapons?

03:23:35.902 --> 03:23:36.507
TRAVIS: Nope.

03:23:36.507 --> 03:23:37.303
LAURA: Just a fist fight.

03:23:37.303 --> 03:23:38.236
ASHLEY: No armor? Nothing?

03:23:38.236 --> 03:23:40.083
TRAVIS: No, you can have--

03:23:40.083 --> 03:23:41.404
LAURA: Yeah, armor?

03:23:41.404 --> 03:23:45.708
TRAVIS: It's like a bare-knuckle fight.

03:23:45.708 --> 03:23:49.000
MATT: Yeah, it's pretty much fisticuffs in the
Crucible.

03:23:49.000 --> 03:23:50.343
LIAM: They got gnome fights there?

03:23:50.343 --> 03:23:51.360
LAURA: They got gnome fights?

03:23:51.360 --> 03:23:52.928
ASHLEY: They got gnome fights?

03:23:52.928 --> 03:23:54.140
MATT: (laughs)

03:23:54.140 --> 03:23:55.450
ASHLEY: That sounds like a blast.

03:23:55.450 --> 03:23:58.580
TALIESIN: I wanna see if I can find two small
stones while we're walking through the path.

03:23:58.580 --> 03:24:03.747
I wanna find two pretty reasonable fire-starting
stones.

03:24:03.747 --> 03:24:04.943
MATT: Flints, you mean?

03:24:04.943 --> 03:24:06.323
TALIESIN: Yeah, just a flint.

03:24:06.323 --> 03:24:11.749
MATT: Okay. Make a perception check-- well, this
would be investigation, 'cause you're--

03:24:11.749 --> 03:24:14.081
TALIESIN: Man. Nine

03:24:14.081 --> 03:24:16.176
MATT: You find one.

03:24:16.176 --> 03:24:22.307
TALIESIN: Damn it. I'm gonna keep looking.

03:24:22.307 --> 03:24:24.006
LAURA: What're you doing with a rock?

03:24:24.006 --> 03:24:25.020
TALIESIN: (sighs)

03:24:25.020 --> 03:24:26.878
LAURA: Doesn't seem like something you normally
look for.

03:24:26.878 --> 03:24:27.824
TALIESIN: No, it's not.

03:24:27.824 --> 03:24:29.109
LAURA: It's more Grog's speed there.

03:24:29.109 --> 03:24:30.762
TALIESIN: Yeah, I was just thinking that he needs
a gift.

03:24:30.762 --> 03:24:32.822
TRAVIS: I mean does anybody-- You got a gift for
me?

03:24:32.822 --> 03:24:33.701
TALIESIN: Not yet.

03:24:33.701 --> 03:24:39.201
TRAVIS: Oh. I mean, I dunno about anybody else,
but besides the store, I would like to go by the

03:24:39.201 --> 03:24:44.463
temple of Kord again. Just pop in. I don't want to
bore anybody.

03:24:44.463 --> 03:24:45.920
MARISHA: No.

03:24:45.920 --> 03:24:46.876
TALIESIN: I'm all right with that.

03:24:46.876 --> 03:24:47.646
LAURA: We can go there.

03:24:47.646 --> 03:24:48.595
TRAVIS: Oh, okay.

03:24:48.595 --> 03:24:52.028
MARISHA: I'm sure we bored you several times with
our god mumbo-jumbo.

03:24:52.028 --> 03:24:54.569
TRAVIS: No, yeah, you have. Been keeping track.

03:24:54.569 --> 03:24:56.098
(everyone laughs)

03:24:56.098 --> 03:24:58.946
MARISHA: Tell me how you really feel, Grog. Yeah.

03:24:58.946 --> 03:25:01.164
TRAVIS: I resent you.

03:25:01.164 --> 03:25:05.053
MARISHA: You know what? Never mind. I take all of
it back.

03:25:05.053 --> 03:25:09.851
TRAVIS: Well, I thought you-- all right.

03:25:09.851 --> 03:25:16.569
LIAM: Tangentially, not today, not for a while. I
need to go back to--

03:25:16.569 --> 03:25:17.804
MARISHA: The temple of the Raven Queen?

03:25:17.804 --> 03:25:19.738
LIAM: Yeah, not today. Eventually.

03:25:19.738 --> 03:25:21.047
MARISHA: Do you even want to today?

03:25:21.047 --> 03:25:22.732
LIAM: No, I don't want to today.

03:25:22.732 --> 03:25:30.053
MARISHA: You know, you never came back last night.
Thought you were gonna come back.

03:25:30.208 --> 03:25:38.314
LIAM: (softly) I'll come back.

03:25:38.314 --> 03:25:39.854
MARISHA: Carry on!

03:25:39.854 --> 03:25:41.269
(laughter)

03:25:41.269 --> 03:25:44.991
MATT: So as you guys are walking, where are you
headed? Are you headed to the Birth--

03:25:44.991 --> 03:25:46.596
TRAVIS: The Birth?

03:25:46.596 --> 03:25:47.758
MATT: Uh, what's it called? Sorry.

03:25:47.758 --> 03:25:48.728
TRAVIS: The Trial Forge?

03:25:48.728 --> 03:25:49.787
MATT: Oh, the Trial Forge is--

03:25:49.787 --> 03:25:50.862
TRAVIS: The temple of Kord?

03:25:50.862 --> 03:25:51.598
MATT: -- is the temple. Yeah.

03:25:51.598 --> 03:25:53.744
TRAVIS: Yeah. I mean, I would like to go to the
temple of Kord. Pike, do you want to see--

03:25:53.744 --> 03:25:54.824
MATT: The Braving Grounds.

03:25:54.824 --> 03:25:56.116
TRAVIS: Yeah, the Braving Grounds.

03:25:56.116 --> 03:25:57.252
LAURA: The Braving Grounds.

03:25:57.252 --> 03:25:58.244
LIAM: Oh, man.

03:25:58.244 --> 03:25:59.510
LAURA: By the Obleiz.

03:25:59.510 --> 03:26:00.652
LIAM: The Oubliette?

03:26:00.652 --> 03:26:01.675
LAURA: Obliette.

03:26:01.675 --> 03:26:02.760
ASHLEY: Oubliette.

03:26:02.760 --> 03:26:03.926
MATT: (laughs)

03:26:03.926 --> 03:26:05.119
MARISHA: (aside to Taliesin) What do you want for
me to cantrip?

03:26:05.119 --> 03:26:06.617
TALIESIN: (aside to Marisha) Well, I just want,
like, another one. Two.

03:26:06.617 --> 03:26:08.334
LIAM: Does that exist somewhere in this city, the
Oubliette?

03:26:08.334 --> 03:26:09.318
LAURA: It does!

03:26:09.318 --> 03:26:10.473
MARISHA: Two plinths? Yeah, I think I can
Druidcraft that.

03:26:10.473 --> 03:26:12.190
LIAM: It it likely that we have--

03:26:12.190 --> 03:26:20.242
MATT: It is in-- let me check my notes real fast.
It's in the Duskmeadows.

03:26:20.242 --> 03:26:21.780
The Amaranthine Oubliette.

03:26:21.780 --> 03:26:23.172
LAURA: Oh, that's what it was.

03:26:23.172 --> 03:26:24.946
LIAM: Right. Oh, out of character, Ashley, I wish
you were here next week.

03:26:24.946 --> 03:26:26.065
ASHLEY: (groans)

03:26:26.065 --> 03:26:27.271
LIAM: We're gonna get into a fuckin' fist fight!

03:26:27.271 --> 03:26:28.198
LAURA: Oh, man!

03:26:28.198 --> 03:26:29.587
LIAM: Down in the Crucible!

03:26:29.587 --> 03:26:30.617
TRAVIS: She's looking at her schedule.

03:26:30.617 --> 03:26:32.000
LAURA: Are you looking at your schedule?

03:26:32.000 --> 03:26:36.654
TRAVIS: Can we make our way towards the Temple of
Kord?

03:26:36.654 --> 03:26:39.899
MATT: Yes, so you guys make your way to the Birth
Heart. It's easy to follow. Out of all the areas

03:26:39.899 --> 03:26:43.676
in here that are more clean-- the Birth Heart,
sorry, the Braving Grounds.

03:26:43.676 --> 03:26:44.487
TRAVIS: Yeah.

03:26:44.487 --> 03:26:49.709
MATT: The Braving Grounds is where all the
ironwork, metalwork, smithy, and refining of

03:26:49.709 --> 03:26:57.677
various burnable fuels are maintained. So you see
the plumes of coal smoke coming out of the various

03:26:57.677 --> 03:27:06.785
forges. You head that direction, following that as
a very definitive visual reference point. It takes

03:27:06.785 --> 03:27:13.859
you the better part of an hour or so, making your
way through the crowds, the Bastions, and it seems

03:27:13.859 --> 03:27:16.985
like not a whole lot has changed since last time
you were in Vasselheim. For all the chaos and

03:27:16.985 --> 03:27:22.960
destruction you have seen in Tal'Dorei, it appears
that Isilra is none the wiser, and life goes on.

03:27:22.960 --> 03:27:25.347
LAURA: Wow.

03:27:25.347 --> 03:27:28.111
MATT: You make your way through the Braving
Grounds to the Trial Forge. And there you see

03:27:28.111 --> 03:27:34.898
before you the large Temple of Kord, the dark deep
red rusted iron color of the temple, with the

03:27:34.898 --> 03:27:45.248
statue on top. The front doors, the tall, thin
doors are open just enough for about two

03:27:45.248 --> 03:27:51.074
shoulders-width of people to walk through. The
interior appears to be brightly lit.

03:27:51.074 --> 03:27:54.951
TRAVIS: Do you want to go inside? Only the strong
may enter.

03:27:54.951 --> 03:27:56.402
ASHLEY: Yeah, I'll go with you.

03:27:56.402 --> 03:27:58.895
TRAVIS: All right. I would like to go inside.

03:27:58.895 --> 03:27:59.577
MATT: All right.

03:27:59.577 --> 03:28:03.500
LAURA: Should we wait out here for you?

03:28:03.500 --> 03:28:06.418
TRAVIS: Meh. You can come in if you want.

03:28:06.418 --> 03:28:07.886
LAURA: All right.

03:28:07.886 --> 03:28:09.888
TRAVIS: Yeah.

03:28:09.888 --> 03:28:15.986
MATT: Okay. You guys walk into the temple. There
are no sentries.

03:28:16.042 --> 03:28:20.053
There are no worshipers of Kord that you remember

03:28:20.053 --> 03:28:22.909
greeting you the first time you came to the temple.

03:28:22.909 --> 03:28:27.168
The hallway's just this
straight shot to the central cross section.

03:28:27.168 --> 03:28:33.306
TRAVIS: That's strange. There's usually people
here. (clears throat) Hello?

03:28:33.306 --> 03:28:41.198
MATT: You keep walking, making your way down the
smooth, dark, granite-like floors. You can see the

03:28:41.198 --> 03:28:48.411
tall archway just continues and the repeated
pattern of the pillars that mark the strength

03:28:48.411 --> 03:28:53.811
portions of the archway, meeting in the center,
just over and over again, like this oversized

03:28:53.811 --> 03:28:59.318
spinal column, almost, in the way that it's
segmented, eventually coming to where the center

03:28:59.318 --> 03:29:05.815
points cross, where the sand pit, you recall, the
center of the Trial Forge was. As you approach,

03:29:05.815 --> 03:29:10.126
you see a singular figure standing in the center
of the pit, facing away from you.

03:29:10.126 --> 03:29:12.348
TRAVIS: (blows out a slow breath)

03:29:12.348 --> 03:29:23.621
MATT: You see the same dark, deep ruddy color and
weather-texture of the shoulder muscles and arms

03:29:23.621 --> 03:29:32.636
resting at the side. The same grayish-white hair
pulling down the back of the bald-on-top head. The

03:29:32.636 --> 03:29:41.127
reds and golds of the billowing pants there before
you. And as you approach quietly towards the edge

03:29:41.127 --> 03:29:47.208
of the sand pit, the voice shouts out,

03:29:47.208 --> 03:29:57.360
"I have had visions in my rest of your path to 
war, Strongjaw. You took my words and you

03:29:57.360 --> 03:30:07.916
found your strength.
What have you learned?"

03:30:07.916 --> 03:30:16.881
TRAVIS: That without my friends, and love, my
strength would be nothing.

03:30:16.881 --> 03:30:18.702
MATT: Then show me what you have learned.

03:30:18.702 --> 03:30:20.228
LAURA: Oh, shit.

03:30:20.228 --> 03:30:28.068
MATT: "Show me what you possess. Show me your
worth under the watch of Kord, half-giant.

03:30:28.068 --> 03:30:29.237
"Show me."

03:30:29.237 --> 03:30:32.282
And he turns around. (smashing sound) And
he--

03:30:32.282 --> 03:30:33.068
LAURA: Fight!

03:30:33.068 --> 03:30:35.534
MATT: -- slams his fists into the side and the
sand that's around him (exploding sound), dusts

03:30:35.534 --> 03:30:42.016
out in this small arc and then rests in the ground
and he looks up.

03:30:42.016 --> 03:30:43.779
TRAVIS: I'm having a DBZ orgasm right now.

03:30:43.779 --> 03:30:45.252
LAURA: (sings the Dragon Ball Z theme song)

03:30:45.252 --> 03:30:46.332
MATT: And that's where we're gonna finish the
episode.

03:30:46.332 --> 03:30:48.094
(everyone yells)

03:30:48.094 --> 03:30:49.642
MATT: (laughs)

03:30:49.642 --> 03:30:50.762
MARISHA: Show me what you've GOOOOT!

03:30:50.762 --> 03:30:52.061
TALIESIN: --what you've GOOOOT!

03:30:52.061 --> 03:30:53.297
TALIESIN: Show me what you've GOOOOT!

03:30:53.297 --> 03:30:54.744
MARISHA: Show me what you've GOOOOT!

03:30:54.744 --> 03:30:56.245
TALIESIN: Show me what you've got!

03:30:56.245 --> 03:30:57.999
(everyone laughs)

03:30:57.999 --> 03:31:02.174
LAURA: How long have you waited-- how long have
you--

03:31:02.174 --> 03:31:03.108
TRAVIS: Since last time.

03:31:03.108 --> 03:31:04.307
LAURA: Oh, shit!

03:31:04.307 --> 03:31:05.375
MARISHA: Yes!

03:31:05.375 --> 03:31:06.348
LAURA: Oh, man.

03:31:06.348 --> 03:31:07.549
MATT: Since, like, whenever you got back to the
Trial Forge--

03:31:07.549 --> 03:31:08.611
TRAVIS: (cries out)

03:31:08.611 --> 03:31:09.665
MATT: -- that's been sitting there.

03:31:09.665 --> 03:31:10.956
MARISHA: Yeah!

03:31:10.956 --> 03:31:11.829
MATT: You never went back.

03:31:11.829 --> 03:31:13.149
TALIESIN: What? What?

03:31:13.149 --> 03:31:14.462
MATT: We'll pick up on, pick up on that next week.

03:31:14.462 --> 03:31:15.601
LIAM: Round two. Fight!

03:31:15.601 --> 03:31:16.694
MARISHA: Fight!

03:31:16.694 --> 03:31:19.782
(Taliesin and Marisha sing the Mortal Kombat
Theme)

03:31:19.782 --> 03:31:21.507
TRAVIS: He's a bad dude.

03:31:21.507 --> 03:31:23.371
LAURA: Yeah, but in the best way.

03:31:23.371 --> 03:31:26.882
TRAVIS: It was Scanlan, Vax, and me against him--

03:31:26.882 --> 03:31:28.076
LIAM: Don't pick me again.

03:31:28.076 --> 03:31:30.729
TRAVIS: -- and we were giving him everything we
had with Craven Edge,

03:31:30.729 --> 03:31:32.130
and he was just shrugging it
off, like--

03:31:32.130 --> 03:31:33.295
ASHLEY: Nothing.

03:31:33.295 --> 03:31:35.439
TRAVIS: Yeah, we were slashing through at his
forearms and then he would,

03:31:35.439 --> 03:31:38.445
like, go (grunting
sound) and all the wounds would heal.

03:31:38.445 --> 03:31:39.618
ASHLEY: (laughs)

03:31:39.618 --> 03:31:42.473
TRAVIS: Who did he one-hit punch? The one punch?

03:31:42.473 --> 03:31:44.149
LIAM: Me.

03:31:44.149 --> 03:31:46.366
TRAVIS: Yeah, and he could have killed Vax.

03:31:46.366 --> 03:31:47.179
ASHLEY: One punch!

03:31:47.179 --> 03:31:48.942
TRAVIS: With one punch. But he held it.

03:31:48.942 --> 03:31:49.769
MARISHA: With quivering--

03:31:49.769 --> 03:31:50.692
TALIESIN: Quivering Palm.

03:31:50.692 --> 03:31:51.822
MATT: He held back specifically. He was just
teaching Grog a lesson.

03:31:51.822 --> 03:31:53.118
LAURA: It's serious.

03:31:53.118 --> 03:31:54.886
TRAVIS: He just held him one hit, like boom! And
Vex went waaaaah!

03:31:54.886 --> 03:31:55.742
LAURA: Vax.

03:31:55.742 --> 03:31:56.430
TRAVIS: Sorry.

03:31:56.430 --> 03:31:57.355
LIAM: Vix.

03:31:57.355 --> 03:31:58.891
TALIESIN: The potion of broken heart.

03:31:58.891 --> 03:31:59.880
TRAVIS: He's a bad, bad dude.

03:31:59.880 --> 03:32:00.857
ASHLEY: Oh, my god.

03:32:00.857 --> 03:32:02.137
LAURA: But in a good way. He's, like, super, super
smart.

03:32:02.137 --> 03:32:03.329
MARISHA: He's awesome.

03:32:03.329 --> 03:32:04.242
ASHLEY: You're gonna have your--

03:32:04.242 --> 03:32:08.125
TRAVIS: Well, the last time he was like, "Where
does your strength come from?"

03:32:08.125 --> 03:32:09.372
And I'm like, "My rage!"

03:32:09.372 --> 03:32:10.336
LAURA: (laughs)

03:32:10.336 --> 03:32:11.616
ASHLEY: And he's like, "Not good enough."

03:32:11.616 --> 03:32:12.989
TRAVIS: And he kept kicking our asses, like,
"Where does your strength come from!"

03:32:12.989 --> 03:32:14.473
I'm like, "My friends!"

03:32:14.473 --> 03:32:15.788
(all laugh)

03:32:15.788 --> 03:32:17.046
TRAVIS: And he let us live.

03:32:17.046 --> 03:32:18.088
MATT: It'll be fun.

03:32:18.088 --> 03:32:18.866
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:32:18.866 --> 03:32:19.868
MATT: So, we'll see where this picks up next week.

03:32:19.868 --> 03:32:20.651
TRAVIS: Okay.

03:32:20.651 --> 03:32:21.510
LAURA: Oh, my.

03:32:21.510 --> 03:32:22.373
LIAM: Yeah, yeah.

03:32:22.373 --> 03:32:24.180
MATT: Well, awesome, guys. Good game this week.
You saved your friend.

03:32:24.180 --> 03:32:25.334
TALIESIN: (whimpers)

03:32:25.334 --> 03:32:26.246
LAURA: Yay, Scanlan!

03:32:26.246 --> 03:32:27.199
TRAVIS: Come back soon, Sam!

03:32:27.199 --> 03:32:28.057
ASHLEY: Come back!

03:32:28.057 --> 03:32:29.428
MARISHA: Scanlan!

03:32:29.428 --> 03:32:31.662
MATT: And Happy Birthday to Quyen.

03:32:31.662 --> 03:32:32.285
MARISHA: Happy birthday!

03:32:32.285 --> 03:32:33.199
LAURA: Happy birthday!

03:32:33.199 --> 03:32:34.714
TRAVIS: Happy birthday, Q! Happy birthday!

03:32:34.714 --> 03:32:35.694
LIAM: We love you!

03:32:35.694 --> 03:32:38.082
LAURA: And don't forget, tomorrow at noon, these
dice go on sale!

03:32:38.082 --> 03:32:39.715
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:32:39.715 --> 03:32:41.218
LAURA: Yay, Crit Role dice!

03:32:41.218 --> 03:32:43.018
TRAVIS: There's not an infinite amount, but
