00:00:00.317 --> 00:00:04.687
MATT: Hello, everyone! And welcome to tonight's
episode of Critical Role One-Shots, where we have

00:00:04.687 --> 00:00:10.132
taken over the slot of "No Survivors" this Monday
thanks to the illustrious generosity of the

00:00:10.132 --> 00:00:12.026
fantastic Ivan Van Norman.

00:00:12.026 --> 00:00:17.219
IVAN: Any day, you may take the slot whenever you
wish, especially when I get to be a player.

00:00:17.219 --> 00:00:22.470
MATT: I like it when Ivan tells me it's okay for
me to "take his slot." The way he says it. But

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:29.044
yeah, so this evening we have the fantastic
pleasure of running a one-shot game of Pathfinder,

00:00:29.044 --> 00:00:33.072
which, for those of you who haven't played,
Pathfinder is a fantastic fantasy RPG, it's

00:00:33.072 --> 00:00:38.478
actually what we played for the first two years of
Critical Role. And tonight we get to show a fun

00:00:38.478 --> 00:00:44.496
story that we've put together for this series of
players here, as well as show off the really cool

00:00:44.496 --> 00:00:48.330
software Syrinscape, which I mentioned a few times
in the show, I use it to organize a lot of the

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:53.410
music and sound cues for Critical Role, we get to
show you some more of what it's capable of tonight

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:57.650
outside of my custom settings, this is what the
actual setup itself can do, which is phenomenal.

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:03.001
So, super excited to back that. Before we get
started, let me go ahead and introduce our

00:01:03.001 --> 00:01:08.613
fantastic players for this evening. We have on the
table to my left, we have Ivan, who you've already

00:01:08.613 --> 00:01:12.633
seen thus far, Ivan Van Norman, hello. Thank you
for joining us.

00:01:12.633 --> 00:01:15.384
IVAN: I am happy to be here. Thank you for having
me.

00:01:15.384 --> 00:01:18.398
MATT: Yay! We have Marisha Ray from Critical
Role.

00:01:18.398 --> 00:01:19.818
MARISHA: Hi, guys!

00:01:19.818 --> 00:01:24.159
MATT: And to the other table, we have Taliesin
Jaffe from Critical Role.

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:25.390
TALIESIN: Hi!

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:29.752
MATT: And our very two special guests joining us
this evening, Ashly Burch--

00:01:29.752 --> 00:01:30.828
ASHLY: Hello!

00:01:30.828 --> 00:01:33.328
MATT: And Phil Lamarr!

00:01:33.328 --> 00:01:42.625
PHIL: (deep voice) Why, hi there! I'm going to use
this voice all night! For no good reason. A goblin

00:01:42.625 --> 00:01:44.295
with a large set of testicles.

00:01:44.295 --> 00:01:45.909
(laughter)

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:48.742
MATT: Which, to let you guys know, tonight's game
is going to be interesting because unlike a lot of

00:01:48.742 --> 00:01:54.804
other fantasy RPGs, tonight the whole party is
goblins. Everyone are playing goblins, we'll go

00:01:54.804 --> 00:01:59.572
ahead and do some quick introductions as to who
you're playing, starting clockwise back from how

00:01:59.572 --> 00:02:01.867
we were introduced. So, Phil, who are you playing
as?

00:02:01.867 --> 00:02:14.371
PHIL: I'm playing as Browntooth the rogue. Goblin
rogue. Sort of redundant. But it's a very large

00:02:14.371 --> 00:02:16.206
word that I learned. Redundant.

00:02:16.206 --> 00:02:19.473
IVAN: And someone clearly cast Bull's Strength on
those testicles.

00:02:19.473 --> 00:02:24.524
MATT: Ashly, who are you playing?

00:02:24.524 --> 00:02:26.803
ASHLY: I'm Piglet the barbarian.

00:02:26.803 --> 00:02:32.812
MATT: Delightful. Taliesin?

00:02:32.812 --> 00:02:34.750
TALIESIN: I'm Mezek the monk.

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:40.003
MATT: Aw, this is going to be fun. Marisha.

00:02:40.003 --> 00:02:43.480
MARISHA: I'm Snizzler, the mad bombing alchemist!

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:48.258
MATT: Oh, man. I'm already excited. And Ivan.

00:02:48.258 --> 00:02:55.412
IVAN: Grizznak Stompstork, reporting for duty.
Goblin fartmage, available to all of you. I am the

00:02:55.412 --> 00:02:57.812
brains of the bunch, as you can see.

00:02:57.812 --> 00:03:01.988
MATT: Perfect! This will be a fun adventure for
the evening.

00:03:01.988 --> 00:03:06.024
TALIESIN: You actually get to use the phrase,
"I've smelt it, now it's time that I dealt it."

00:03:06.024 --> 00:03:09.291
IVAN: Stolen, it will be used.

00:03:09.291 --> 00:03:12.018
TALIESIN: Yeah, take it. Public domain, public
domain. I'm sorry if I already stepped on that one.

00:03:12.018 --> 00:03:15.827
MATT: So we've got to go through a couple quick
announcements here and then we'll overview the game

00:03:15.827 --> 00:03:21.657
stuff. So for those watching, I want to remind you
that this Thursday is Critical Role's 50th

00:03:21.657 --> 00:03:27.075
episode. We're having a special episode to
commemorate this, a couple of surprises that we

00:03:27.075 --> 00:03:31.818
have in store for you guys, so definitely be there
at Thursday at 7:00pm Pacific to check out our

00:03:31.818 --> 00:03:35.879
50th episode. Marisha, you have a new episode of
Signal Boost tomorrow--

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:44.381
MARISHA: Yes! Episode two of Hector! Which is
episode six of Signal Boost! Watch it.

00:03:44.381 --> 00:03:49.152
MATT: And having already seen it, this episode has
my favorite intro so far. I laughed for five solid

00:03:49.152 --> 00:03:51.477
minutes straight, so you'll enjoy it.

00:03:51.477 --> 00:03:54.857
MARISHA: It's very funny. Check it out, it's very
funny. Hector's funny.

00:03:54.857 --> 00:03:56.000
IVAN: Hector's the best.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.381
MATT: Indeed. So part of this whole event tonight,
with the folks at Pathfinder, Paizo, and

00:04:01.381 --> 00:04:05.208
Syrinscape, is in celebration of the upcoming
International Tabletop Day!

00:04:05.208 --> 00:04:06.639
(cheering)

00:04:06.639 --> 00:04:09.853
MATT: It is happening on April 30th, we'll be
doing a whole series of great events here in the

00:04:09.853 --> 00:04:13.584
studio throughout the day so mark it on your
calendars, get your friends together--

00:04:13.584 --> 00:04:16.852
IVAN: 24 hours of livestreaming.

00:04:16.852 --> 00:04:18.960
MATT: Yes! It's going to be great. It's going to
be great.

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:21.327
ASHLY: For charity, right? For a good cause?

00:04:21.327 --> 00:04:27.939
IVAN: KaBOOM! kaboom.org, which is bringing play
back into the lives of children currently living

00:04:27.939 --> 00:04:30.791
in property, (scoffs) "in property." In poverty!

00:04:30.791 --> 00:04:34.178
MATT: Children who have been bricked into walls!
It's horrible!

00:04:34.178 --> 00:04:41.301
PHIL: They're stuck on estates! With nothing but
ponies. They need to play!

00:04:41.301 --> 00:04:45.138
IVAN: They're living amongst property, land is
surrounding them. No, guys, so currently kids

00:04:45.138 --> 00:04:49.042
living in poverty and they're trying to bring play
back into their lives, such as things like

00:04:49.042 --> 00:04:54.696
board games, and we're actually going to be giving
away a lot of board games to kaboom.org, part of

00:04:54.696 --> 00:04:58.700
your involvement during International Tabletop
Day, so don't miss it.

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:04.512
MATT: And if you'd like to plug what usually
occupies this spot on Mondays...?

00:05:04.512 --> 00:05:08.689
IVAN: Oh, well, if you're a Critical Role fan, or
if you're any kind of fan, and normally you're

00:05:08.689 --> 00:05:13.186
here Monday nights, then thank you for coming on
Monday night again. If you're not, and this a

00:05:13.186 --> 00:05:17.532
weird timeslot for you, we still play role-playing
games on Monday nights, they are just

00:05:17.532 --> 00:05:23.948
mini-campaigns instead of the epic, long
brainchild of Matt Mercer's amazing imagination,

00:05:23.948 --> 00:05:29.283
instead we do little one-offs, like we just got
done playing "Army of Darkness" which was then

00:05:29.283 --> 00:05:37.258
created by chat, it was coined "The Arby's of
Darkness," because their last stand was in the

00:05:37.258 --> 00:05:41.164
middle of an Arby's restaurant which one of the
characters managed. And officially--

00:05:41.164 --> 00:05:42.256
MARISHA: That's amazing

00:05:42.256 --> 00:05:43.396
IVAN: It was pretty cool.

00:05:43.396 --> 00:05:45.719
TALIESIN: What meat is this? What meat is this?!

00:05:45.719 --> 00:05:50.500
IVAN: The deadites actually came out through the
portal at the very end of it, and they were all

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:53.520
the busboys, and the, "I'll swallow your soul,
I'll swallow your soul!"

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:55.762
TALIESIN: That's every Arby's I've ever been to.

00:05:55.762 --> 00:05:57.340
PHIL: Really, it's the same thing.

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:01.175
IVAN: And the next campaign that we're going to be
doing officially/unofficially, is going to be

00:06:01.175 --> 00:06:08.048
"Pugmire," which is a new game, it's basically 5th
edition in a world of fantasy dogs. It's

00:06:08.048 --> 00:06:09.411
a post-apocalyptic future--

00:06:09.411 --> 00:06:12.372
MARISHA: I was going to make a joke about that,
and then it was the real thing, so--

00:06:12.372 --> 00:06:16.194
IVAN: It exists. It's in the future, in which all
man has been wiped out and now dogs reign supreme,

00:06:16.194 --> 00:06:20.797
and they have formed a church called, "The Church
of Man," in which they have a code of laws, the

00:06:20.797 --> 00:06:27.169
first law being, "Be a good dog." The second law
being, "Fetch what has been left behind," and the

00:06:27.169 --> 00:06:32.549
third being, I believe it's, "Bite only those who
attack you." So it's great--

00:06:32.549 --> 00:06:35.138
ASHLY: I'm imagining Mad Max with dogs, in my mind
now.

00:06:35.138 --> 00:06:37.217
IVAN: But it's fantasy, it's still fantasy.

00:06:37.217 --> 00:06:46.764
IVAN: So you could be like, a pincer cleric, or
you could be a dachshund rogue or something like that.

00:06:46.764 --> 00:06:47.953
MATT: That's fantastic.

00:06:47.953 --> 00:06:50.558
IVAN: So 7:00-10:00pm usually on Mondays, come
hang out.

00:06:50.558 --> 00:06:57.255
MATT: Do it. Check it out, guys. It's pretty
fantastic. So, another cool thing about having

00:06:57.255 --> 00:07:03.061
Paizo, the folks from Pathfinder here, is we have
a bunch of giveaways to give out throughout the

00:07:03.061 --> 00:07:05.148
evening to all you guys in chat.

00:07:05.148 --> 00:07:09.968
MARISHA: Like, there's a bag of stuff. I don't
even know what it is. It's exciting.

00:07:09.968 --> 00:07:11.378
TALIESIN: I think that's edamame.

00:07:11.378 --> 00:07:18.855
MATT: First off, you guys can go to
paizo.com/goblins, and store.syrinscape.com/geek

00:07:18.855 --> 00:07:24.052
to get 25% off a number of their goblin goods and
stuff as part of tonight's promotional thing. Go

00:07:24.052 --> 00:07:27.672
check it out, a lot of cool things there to grab.
But throughout the evening we'll be giving away

00:07:27.672 --> 00:07:33.461
small giveaways that include Pathfinder Core
rulebook pdfs in chat, the "Burnt Offerings

00:07:33.461 --> 00:07:40.386
Adventure" pdf, the soundset from Syrinscape that
accompanies the "Burnt Offerings Adventure," and

00:07:40.386 --> 00:07:44.698
one grand prize winner tonight will get a whole
bunch of stuff that includes the Core book, the

00:07:44.698 --> 00:07:49.002
Monster Codex, the "Inner Seas Races," the "Burnt
Offerings," the "We be goblins" set, the goblin

00:07:49.002 --> 00:07:52.251
promo figure, the town square flip mat, goblin
bank, goblin plush, a whole bunch of crazy stuff.

00:07:52.251 --> 00:07:56.282
So, big old grand prize for one of you guys out
there, so make sure you're engaging.

00:07:56.346 --> 00:07:57.406
IVAN: Yeah.

00:07:57.406 --> 00:07:59.208
MATT: Anyway. Now that that's over with--

00:07:59.208 --> 00:08:00.115
PHIL: Woo!

00:08:00.115 --> 00:08:02.795
(laughter)

00:08:02.795 --> 00:08:06.995
MATT: For tonight's game, you guys will be playing
goblins, of course. I'll go over the story here in

00:08:07.146 --> 00:08:11.564
a moment, but things to consider: part of
tonight's fun is, at certain points during the

00:08:11.564 --> 00:08:18.510
story, if you roll really crappily on a roll, or
you want to get that extra action in, you're doing

00:08:18.510 --> 00:08:23.867
good and you want to get that extra attack or
extra ability, each of you have constructed and

00:08:23.867 --> 00:08:29.361
have at your disposal a goblin song that is custom
to your character. You may choose to sing this

00:08:29.361 --> 00:08:34.752
song out loud on the stream and doing so will gain
use of that reroll or that extra action. Use it

00:08:34.752 --> 00:08:38.858
sparingly, it's only once in a while, possibly a
once-a-night type circumstance. But I'm exci--

00:08:38.858 --> 00:08:42.563
(burps) pardon, I'm excited to hear all of your
individual songs as we progress.

00:08:42.563 --> 00:08:44.935
MARISHA: So excited, it gave him indigestion.

00:08:44.935 --> 00:08:52.487
MATT: It's how it's the reaction, I get nervous,
guys. Great. So, that being the case, let's go

00:08:52.487 --> 00:08:55.112
ahead and get this show on the road.

00:08:55.112 --> 00:08:56.556
MARISHA: Oh my god, I'm so excited.

00:08:56.556 --> 00:08:58.075
IVAN: There we go. Goblin pants!

00:08:58.075 --> 00:09:02.837
MARISHA: Also, I'm using Liam's dice box because
he's not here, and he can't stop it.

00:09:02.837 --> 00:09:04.638
(laughter)

00:09:04.638 --> 00:09:07.320
IVAN: Liam, I'm touching your stuff, I'm touching
your stuff.

00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:09.254
MARISHA: I'm going to rub my butt on it.

00:09:09.254 --> 00:09:21.327
MATT: Here in the Sandpoint Hinterlands, nestled
in the western side of the Devil's Platter

00:09:21.327 --> 00:09:27.445
Mountain Range, there lies the Bird-Cruncher Tribe
of rather rambunctious goblins known for their

00:09:27.445 --> 00:09:31.607
deft trapping skills, having earned their name and
the majority of their food supply by snaring wild

00:09:31.607 --> 00:09:38.769
birds and eating them raw. You five have grown up
together here among the caves and cliffs over the

00:09:38.769 --> 00:09:44.538
past six years, outliving many of your other
brethren, making you tough. Although most of you

00:09:44.538 --> 00:09:49.987
were the runts, discarded as weak and useless, you
were all taken in and raised within your cages,

00:09:49.987 --> 00:09:54.548
which is how most goblins are raised, by the
sagely Guffeye.

00:09:54.548 --> 00:09:55.752
IVAN: Guffeye.

00:09:55.752 --> 00:10:01.405
MATT: An ancient goblin oracle of nearly 30
years of age, who enjoyed the idea of having her

00:10:01.405 --> 00:10:10.821
own troop of personal guardians, she shouts that
she is touched by the sight of Zogmugot, Lady

00:10:10.821 --> 00:10:16.451
Last-Breath and the goblin hero-god of flotsam and
scavenging, though many of her visions have led to

00:10:16.451 --> 00:10:23.157
grave misfortune and her favor within the tribe has
waned. But you guys believe her! Mostly.

00:10:23.157 --> 00:10:29.406
IVAN: Zogmugot looks favorably upon our lovely
Guffeye.

00:10:29.406 --> 00:10:37.205
MATT: This cold, overcast autumn morning rolls in,
and the five of you are returning from a morning

00:10:37.205 --> 00:10:47.569
snare run, when you hear the sound of crackling
shouts from old Guffeye's crag porch. "Come! Come!

00:10:47.569 --> 00:10:50.879
"The dream! The sight! Come!"

00:10:50.879 --> 00:10:53.412
And she darts back into her little cave
hole.

00:10:53.412 --> 00:10:57.668
IVAN: Guffeye has another dream! You know what
that means!

00:10:57.668 --> 00:11:00.366
PHIL: Someone's going to lose a hand.

00:11:00.366 --> 00:11:04.620
MARISHA: Usually this means she's been drinking, I
just want to point that out.

00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:10.367
IVAN: Well, let's go see what the old windbag's up
to, because you know it's going to involve us

00:11:10.367 --> 00:11:11.457
probably dying.

00:11:11.457 --> 00:11:12.845
PHIL: Probably.

00:11:12.845 --> 00:11:14.242
MARISHA: Let's go!

00:11:14.242 --> 00:11:20.618
MATT: Entering her home, the familiar smell of
pungent spices and rotting wood hits your nose,

00:11:20.618 --> 00:11:27.746
and this hoarder hole of a home is crammed to the
brim with driftwood, molded leather, metal scraps,

00:11:27.746 --> 00:11:32.682
torn hides, broken pottery, all sorts of other
beautiful pieces of junk.

00:11:32.682 --> 00:11:33.880
IVAN: It's amazing.

00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:39.261
MATT: Nostalgia comes over you as you glance at
the empty iron cages you once grew up in, now

00:11:39.261 --> 00:11:46.043
partially buried and filled with wet wool. As you
guys enter, old Guffeye steps onto a small box and

00:11:46.043 --> 00:11:55.407
turns, her snow-blind eyes clouded and bulging
above her toothy grin: "My runts! The Lady gifts

00:11:55.407 --> 00:12:07.619
"Guffeye. The wait is broken! I have a vision once
more. A thing, a great thing was shown to Guffeye,

00:12:07.619 --> 00:12:23.215
"in both these eyes: a stone of crack and thoom! A
rock that barks like the storm! This rock, this

00:12:23.215 --> 00:12:36.304
"stone, Guffeye must have! This Guffeye must get!
You! You must get this stone, bring it to me, for

00:12:36.304 --> 00:12:39.854
"the Lady's blessing."

00:12:39.854 --> 00:12:43.250
ASHLY: Guffeye, if I give it to you first will you
like me the best?

00:12:43.250 --> 00:12:46.110
MATT: "I already like you the best--"

00:12:46.110 --> 00:12:46.990
ASHLY: Yes!

00:12:46.990 --> 00:12:50.007
MATT: "--but I will like you twice best."

00:12:50.007 --> 00:12:51.660
ASHLY: Oh my God.

00:12:51.660 --> 00:12:57.755
IVAN: Guffeye, as your esteemed and most
intellectual advisor, I have to ask: where did the

00:12:57.755 --> 00:13:01.070
Lady bestow this vision upon you that we may find
the barking rock?

00:13:01.070 --> 00:13:08.682
MATT: "Well, I awoke this morning, envisioning
just how much more I like Piglet than the rest of you--"

00:13:08.682 --> 00:13:12.409
IVAN: But I just got done scrubbing all of your
sores last night!

00:13:12.409 --> 00:13:13.597
MATT: "Silence!"

00:13:13.597 --> 00:13:15.254
ASHLY: Sorry, Guffeye.

00:13:15.254 --> 00:13:22.207
MATT: "Upon brewing my morning thatch tea, the
vision struck my face! I dropped it, it shattered,

00:13:22.207 --> 00:13:31.829
"in a beautiful clattering of broken pottery, and I
saw before me a reminder that today is a special

00:13:31.829 --> 00:13:43.413
"day. The sun. The sun rise highest in the sky!
Today is the day of the human festival in

00:13:43.413 --> 00:13:56.518
"Sandpoint-- filthy, stupid human festival! The
Lady showed me a man. A man in blue, blue

00:13:56.518 --> 00:14:03.440
"everywhere, in robes, a church man." (spits)

00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:05.663
(spitting)

00:14:05.663 --> 00:14:13.899
MATT: "His name was Zaan-- Hold on."

00:14:13.899 --> 00:14:16.052
ALL: Zaan?

00:14:16.052 --> 00:14:19.667
MATT: "Zaan-- Zantos."

00:14:19.667 --> 00:14:22.614
ALL: Zantos!

00:14:22.614 --> 00:14:35.956
MATT: "Guffeye saw the people around the churchman
at this festival-- the churchman has the storm

00:14:35.956 --> 00:14:37.981
"rock on him!"

00:14:37.981 --> 00:14:40.681
IVAN: Ooh, storm rock.

00:14:40.681 --> 00:14:53.835
MATT: "So. Go to this Sandpoint. Go to this human
festival. Find this blue-skinned, blue-robed

00:14:53.835 --> 00:14:57.790
"church-man and take the stone for Guffeye, yes?"

00:14:57.790 --> 00:15:02.939
ASHLY: That sounds pretty easy, like nothing bad
will happen?

00:15:02.939 --> 00:15:04.884
IVAN: Easy! Exactly! We got this!

00:15:04.884 --> 00:15:12.152
MATT: "The Lady also showed me: other goblins
know."

00:15:12.152 --> 00:15:13.099
MARISHA: What?!

00:15:13.099 --> 00:15:21.128
MATT: "Stupid, stupid Seven-Tooth tribe also wants
stone, going to city now!"

00:15:21.128 --> 00:15:24.096
IVAN: Why would the Lady show them the blue
stone?

00:15:24.096 --> 00:15:26.215
TALIESIN: Four tooth too many, that's--

00:15:26.215 --> 00:15:29.227
IVAN: Seven tooth too much, two tooth is best
tooth!

00:15:29.227 --> 00:15:30.757
MARISHA: I agree, I agree.

00:15:30.757 --> 00:15:32.118
IVAN: Two tooth is best tooth.

00:15:32.118 --> 00:15:41.178
MATT: "You go. Sneak in! Find churchman! Take
storm rock before Seven-Tooth dumb-dumbs! Bring

00:15:41.178 --> 00:15:46.239
"back to Guffeye, get blessing-- and good meal,
promise."

00:15:46.239 --> 00:15:48.874
PHIL: Oh, well, if there's food--

00:15:48.874 --> 00:15:50.389
TALIESIN: And drink.

00:15:50.389 --> 00:15:57.156
MARISHA: Yeah! Only with a good meal and a drink!
You got it?

00:15:57.156 --> 00:15:59.455
MATT: "This I can provide."

00:15:59.455 --> 00:16:00.708
ASHLY: And dessert?

00:16:00.708 --> 00:16:01.906
MARISHA: Yeah!

00:16:01.906 --> 00:16:04.656
MATT: "Piglet, you're now second most favorite."

00:16:04.656 --> 00:16:07.965
ASHLY: (wailing) No! I didn't mean it! I don't
want dessert!

00:16:07.965 --> 00:16:11.164
PHIL: Greed diminishes you.

00:16:11.164 --> 00:16:13.116
ASHLY: (crying)

00:16:13.116 --> 00:16:15.517
MATT: "Bring me stone, become first favorite!"

00:16:15.517 --> 00:16:16.867
ASHLY: Okay, okay.

00:16:16.867 --> 00:16:19.708
MATT: "Now go! Time is wasting!"

00:16:19.708 --> 00:16:27.578
IVAN: (singing) Blue stone, blue stone, we will
get it all! Blue stone, blue stone, then we'll eat

00:16:27.578 --> 00:16:33.905
them all! Stupid Seven-tooth is going to burn and
burn and die! Burn them all, burn burn, burn and

00:16:33.905 --> 00:16:35.575
burn and die. Yay!

00:16:35.575 --> 00:16:41.705
MATT: (laughs) As you guys exit the cavern, you go
to your various hidey-holes, gather all your

00:16:41.705 --> 00:16:47.796
materials, your weaponry, whatever things you
think you may require on this journey. You know

00:16:47.796 --> 00:16:52.637
that the direction is northwest, past the
Ravenroost mountain pass, towards this town of

00:16:52.637 --> 00:16:58.642
Sandpoint, and that is where your path lies. The
clouds begin to gather overhead at this point in time.

00:16:58.642 --> 00:17:00.577
IVAN: Ooh. Best weather for scavenging!

00:17:00.577 --> 00:17:03.074
PHIL: Nice and clammy.

00:17:03.074 --> 00:17:06.523
IVAN: They won't even see us coming! Because we're
goblins.

00:17:06.523 --> 00:17:10.793
MATT: A gentle rain slowly begins to hit down from
the sky above.

00:17:10.793 --> 00:17:20.333
IVAN: How long is it going to take for us to get
to Sandpoint?

00:17:20.333 --> 00:17:26.232
MATT: Depends on who's the best leader to find
their way there. I guess--

00:17:26.232 --> 00:17:27.907
IVAN: Grizznak is best leader!

00:17:27.907 --> 00:17:29.183
ASHLY: I am best leader!

00:17:29.183 --> 00:17:30.437
IVAN: Grizznak is smarter!

00:17:30.437 --> 00:17:32.147
PHIL: Which way do your feet point?

00:17:32.147 --> 00:17:34.668
MARISHA: Whoever said you were the smartest?

00:17:34.668 --> 00:17:41.663
IVAN: Because I am the wizard, and the wizard is
always the smartest! This is simple goblin logic!

00:17:41.663 --> 00:17:44.542
MARISHA: That is pretty good logic. I agree with
that.

00:17:44.542 --> 00:17:48.693
ASHLY: But I have a big hammer!

00:17:48.693 --> 00:17:50.497
IVAN: But you are-- look--

00:17:50.497 --> 00:17:52.701
TALIESIN: She does have a big hammer, she has a
very fair point.

00:17:52.701 --> 00:17:59.250
IVAN: Guffeye already tells you that you are the
most elite of Guffeye. So we don't want to soil

00:17:59.250 --> 00:18:08.054
poor Piglet into having you out at front, best to
let Snizzler and Grizznak lead the way.

00:18:08.054 --> 00:18:10.552
TALIESIN: You're the most complete, you heard him,
that's absolutely true.

00:18:10.552 --> 00:18:13.212
MARISHA: I agree with that, yeah. You don't want
to tarnish your beautiful, shining reputation.

00:18:13.212 --> 00:18:15.903
ASHLY: You're right. She would be so sad if I
died.

00:18:15.903 --> 00:18:20.053
TALIESIN: Tarnish the, tarnish the handle of the--
yeah, it's--

00:18:20.053 --> 00:18:23.694
ASHLY: Yeah, that's true. She wouldn't care if you
guys died, but if I died she'd probably be sad.

00:18:23.694 --> 00:18:25.013
MARISHA: Exactly, exactly!

00:18:25.013 --> 00:18:28.659
PHIL: Besides, whoever is in front is most likely
to be shot in the face with something.

00:18:28.659 --> 00:18:32.311
MARISHA: Right, so, naturally, we're better to
lead. Am I right, Grizz?

00:18:32.311 --> 00:18:35.301
IVAN: Yeah, you got it Snizzler. Grizz'n'Snizz,
all the way!

00:18:35.301 --> 00:18:36.527
MARISHA: Grizz'n'Snizz!

00:18:36.527 --> 00:18:41.028
IVAN: So I'm assuming I'm going to make some
navigation--

00:18:41.028 --> 00:18:45.728
MATT: I would like for you to make a survival
check, as the leader of his group.

00:18:45.728 --> 00:18:47.400
IVAN: Haha, yes, leader!

00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:49.507
MARISHA: Grizz or Snizz?

00:18:49.507 --> 00:18:51.600
MATT: Well, whoever one is leading.

00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:53.653
MARISHA: Well, he's leading.

00:18:53.653 --> 00:18:58.619
IVAN: I'm clearly the most intelligent goblin in
this troupe.

00:18:58.619 --> 00:19:00.695
MARISHA: Oh boy, you're so smart.

00:19:00.695 --> 00:19:04.004
ASHLY: Do I smell mutiny already?

00:19:04.004 --> 00:19:06.309
PHIL: I think I smell lunch.

00:19:06.309 --> 00:19:11.896
IVAN: But I think, I don't know if I want to burn
my song already.

00:19:11.896 --> 00:19:21.631
MARISHA: Look, Grizz, look. I'm really good at
building things, so naturally I know how to

00:19:21.631 --> 00:19:22.962
survive better.

00:19:22.962 --> 00:19:24.728
IVAN: You did make the best lean-to.

00:19:24.728 --> 00:19:27.449
MARISHA: I did, I did, in the Boy Scouts.

00:19:27.449 --> 00:19:31.450
IVAN: We went to juvie together.

00:19:31.450 --> 00:19:36.883
MARISHA: We did. Good times. Can I try?

00:19:36.883 --> 00:19:42.022
MATT: Well, we'll say you let (laughs) you let him
lead for a while.

00:19:42.022 --> 00:19:43.199
MARISHA: All right.

00:19:43.199 --> 00:19:46.673
MATT: As you start heading northwest, as you begin
to pass the south part of the Ravenroost mountain

00:19:46.673 --> 00:19:56.158
pass, you're led into a relatively thick patch of
very, very painful bramble thicket chunk.

00:19:56.158 --> 00:19:58.322
IVAN: Underbrush is the best!

00:19:58.322 --> 00:20:01.412
ASHLY: I'm beginning to regret rescinding my offer
to be the leader!

00:20:01.412 --> 00:20:06.246
IVAN: Everyone knows-- goblins know that the most
painful path is usually the right path!

00:20:06.246 --> 00:20:11.363
MATT: And the most painful path does manage to
deal two points of damage to all of you as across

00:20:11.363 --> 00:20:14.986
your flesh being dragged through the bramble
thicket.

00:20:14.986 --> 00:20:18.449
MARSIHA: That's only your own self-loathing,
Grizz, Jesus! Ow!

00:20:18.449 --> 00:20:20.053
ASHLY: I could use a writing utensil.

00:20:20.053 --> 00:20:21.334
IVAN: Oh, that hurts.

00:20:21.334 --> 00:20:26.928
MATT: Until eventually Snizzler decides to rise up
in frustration and take over the leader position.

00:20:26.928 --> 00:20:30.149
MARISHA: Jeez, all right, come on. Let me see.

00:20:30.149 --> 00:20:33.731
IVAN: Here, take dick bone, that is the leader
staff.

00:20:33.731 --> 00:20:38.824
MARISHA: All right, thank you. We got it from an
old badger.

00:20:38.824 --> 00:20:41.442
MATT: Go ahead and make your survival check.

00:20:41.442 --> 00:20:43.123
IVAN: I swear this is best.

00:20:43.123 --> 00:20:48.176
ASHLY: Oh no. That's not a good reaction.

00:20:48.176 --> 00:20:49.284
MATT: So?

00:20:49.284 --> 00:20:51.206
MARISHA: I rolled a natural one.

00:20:51.206 --> 00:20:56.743
TALIESIN: And they were never seen or heard from
again. Game over!

00:20:56.743 --> 00:20:58.253
MATT: Well done!

00:20:58.253 --> 00:21:01.742
IVAN: We're running the best goblin scenario ever
right now.

00:21:01.742 --> 00:21:04.845
MARISHA: Are they going to make it out of the
brush?

00:21:04.845 --> 00:21:07.324
TALIESIN: Like brownies and willow, man, we're
done for.

00:21:07.324 --> 00:21:14.698
MATT: Wading deeper and deeper into the bramble
thicket, now under the guidance of Snizzler.

00:21:14.698 --> 00:21:17.207
MARISHA: Look, it's just about finding the flow.

00:21:17.207 --> 00:21:20.976
PHIL: The flow is up my buttocks!

00:21:20.976 --> 00:21:24.645
MATT: You all take an additional one point of
piercing damage as you're

00:21:24.645 --> 00:21:26.772
scratching your way through.

00:21:26.772 --> 00:21:31.320
IVAN: It hurt! Guys, guys, I don't know, but I
think I have one more rash that I didn't have

00:21:31.320 --> 00:21:33.306
previously somewhere.

00:21:33.306 --> 00:21:36.335
MARISHA: Oh, jeez, there's poison oak everywhere!

00:21:36.335 --> 00:21:42.028
MATT: The rain intensifies, starting to echo
through the mountain ranges in the distance, the

00:21:42.028 --> 00:21:48.201
storm appears to be getting relatively stronger.
However, during this travel the rain that is

00:21:48.201 --> 00:21:52.935
washing down the side of the mountain does lead
you to a position of the thicket that isn't quite

00:21:52.935 --> 00:21:56.271
so heavy, and eventually you guys make your way
outside of the immediate

00:21:56.271 --> 00:21:58.136
physical danger of the terrain.

00:21:58.136 --> 00:22:01.338
PHIL: Congratulations.

00:22:01.338 --> 00:22:03.939
TALIESIN: There's got to be some cover around
here.

00:22:03.939 --> 00:22:05.927
MARISHA: I think we're further than we started.

00:22:05.927 --> 00:22:09.892
IVAN: See, at least we're not at the cave
anymore.

00:22:09.892 --> 00:22:14.344
ASHLY: Piglet doesn't like lightning. Can we go
somewhere where there's no lightning?

00:22:14.344 --> 00:22:15.576
MARISHA: Okay.

00:22:15.576 --> 00:22:22.284
IVAN: Well, are we close to a tree? Because trees
are really good to have cover under lightning, I'm told.

00:22:22.284 --> 00:22:26.416
ASHLY: I wasn't sure whether or not you were the
smartest, but that's the best logic I've heard all day.

00:22:26.416 --> 00:22:29.284
MARISHA: I agree! I agree! You kill it every time,
Grizz!

00:22:29.284 --> 00:22:33.250
IVAN: That's why I'm the wizard! (singing) That's
why they call me the greatest!

00:22:33.250 --> 00:22:35.049
MARISHA: You always did read the most.

00:22:35.049 --> 00:22:37.162
PHIL: You call you the greatest. No one else calls
you that!

00:22:37.162 --> 00:22:38.839
IVAN: Well, Grizznak is the greatest.

00:22:38.839 --> 00:22:42.010
MATT: At which point, a large bolt of lightning
hits a tree maybe about 20 feet off from

00:22:42.010 --> 00:22:47.863
you, sending sparks flying, the tree bursts into
flames and tumbles onto the ground. I need--

00:22:47.863 --> 00:22:50.843
MARISHA: Holy shit! Did you see that, dude?!

00:22:50.843 --> 00:22:54.391
IVAN: Look! Look! Zarongel smiles upon us! See,
he's lit our way!

00:22:54.391 --> 00:22:56.648
ASHLY: You said that lightning didn't like trees!

00:22:56.648 --> 00:23:00.318
MARISHA: That was rad, bro! Oh yeah!

00:23:00.318 --> 00:23:02.276
ASHLY: I don't know about these guys...

00:23:02.276 --> 00:23:09.241
IVAN: So, with no cover and nothing around it I
have a feeling maybe we should make a mad dash for

00:23:09.241 --> 00:23:13.232
either caves or potentially Sandpoint. We're not
anywhere close to Sandpoint--

00:23:13.232 --> 00:23:16.648
MATT: You've done a few loops in the area--

00:23:16.648 --> 00:23:17.825
ASHLY: We've been looping?!

00:23:17.825 --> 00:23:20.791
MATT: Did anybody else want to try and lead this
expedition?

00:23:20.791 --> 00:23:25.392
TALIESIN: Did you want to go which way-- no, I
know which way! I'm going to go! And I'm going to

00:23:25.392 --> 00:23:27.057
walk in a direction. Follow me!

00:23:27.057 --> 00:23:28.678
MATT: All right, Mezek.

00:23:28.678 --> 00:23:30.264
MARISHA: I love family outings.

00:23:30.264 --> 00:23:33.558
TALIESIN: What am I rolling? I just rolled, what
do I add to it?

00:23:33.558 --> 00:23:34.593
IVAN: Survival.

00:23:34.593 --> 00:23:40.908
TALIESIN: Survival? Where is survival? 19!

00:23:40.908 --> 00:23:42.089
MATT: All right.

00:23:42.089 --> 00:23:42.908
ASHLY: Finally.

00:23:42.908 --> 00:23:44.169
IVAN: Don't screw this up.

00:23:44.169 --> 00:23:48.990
MATT: And with this, Mezek, for as far as goblin
franticness is concerned, manages to medicate

00:23:48.990 --> 00:23:56.651
himself with various alcohols to a state of
concentration, pushes forward deeper into the

00:23:56.651 --> 00:24:00.794
forest, against your better judgement. But in
doing so, stays out from the rainfall, manages to

00:24:00.794 --> 00:24:05.121
avoid a lot of the lightning storm which is now
blowing over the southern portion of the mountain

00:24:05.121 --> 00:24:09.649
range and leads you guys, over the next couple
hours, through a bit of a muddy, sloshy forest

00:24:09.649 --> 00:24:13.854
terrain towards the outskirts of the actual town.

00:24:13.854 --> 00:24:16.928
IVAN: Is it still night, or is it still--

00:24:16.928 --> 00:24:21.958
MATT: Oh no, it's about mid-day now, it's
pushing-- you're pushing into, like, the early

00:24:21.958 --> 00:24:25.522
afternoon at this point. You've lost a few hours
on your journey.

00:24:25.522 --> 00:24:32.534
TALIESIN: There! I only take about two hours of
responsibility today, and I'm done! It's someone

00:24:32.534 --> 00:24:34.201
else's problem now!

00:24:34.201 --> 00:24:38.245
PHIL: I will lead, now that I can see where I'm
going!

00:24:38.245 --> 00:24:41.617
IVAN: Hey, let's do the circle thing again! That
was fun!

00:24:41.617 --> 00:24:43.619
MARISHA: That was fun, like a game.

00:24:43.619 --> 00:24:47.399
TALIESIN: Was that fun? Because I've experienced what
I thought was fun before, and it was nothing like that!

00:24:47.399 --> 00:24:49.984
PHIL: Most of my fun does not hurt quite so much.

00:24:49.984 --> 00:24:52.079
IVAN: As they say, "No pain, no gain!"

00:24:52.079 --> 00:24:54.834
PHIL: I don't like the ones who say that.

00:24:54.834 --> 00:24:57.287
MATT: All right, guys--

00:24:57.287 --> 00:24:59.412
IVAN: As they say, "No pain, no shame."

00:24:59.412 --> 00:25:02.662
PHIL: I think they just like to rhyme.

00:25:02.662 --> 00:25:08.986
MATT: Following Mezek's path, you eventually make
your way through the forest, alongside the

00:25:08.986 --> 00:25:14.803
southern side of the Lost Coast Road, coming upon
the edge of the trees, to the Tyrandarock River.

00:25:14.803 --> 00:25:21.393
It surrounds the town of Sandpoint itself and
encompasses it. It's a port town that's set on the

00:25:21.393 --> 00:25:25.441
ocean, and this river surrounds the outskirts of
it. So you find the edge. You hit the muddy banks

00:25:25.441 --> 00:25:29.478
of this river, and looking across you can see now
the actual city proper.

00:25:29.478 --> 00:25:33.454
PHIL: Browntooth is very into city planning so
this is very interesting.

00:25:33.454 --> 00:25:35.506
(laughter)

00:25:35.506 --> 00:25:38.415
IVAN: I'm into city burning. That's my favorite.

00:25:38.415 --> 00:25:41.049
MARISHA: Especially if they're human cities.

00:25:41.049 --> 00:25:42.293
PHIL: Yes!

00:25:42.293 --> 00:25:48.805
IVAN: Burning, burning. So, I think because my
survival ability is so amazing, I'd like to

00:25:48.805 --> 00:25:55.789
propose that I try to fashion some sort of
flotsam, with Zarongel's guidance, I would like to

00:25:55.789 --> 00:26:02.378
try to take some flotsam and make some type of
floaty-pushy thing, that we might wade the wiver--

00:26:02.378 --> 00:26:03.561
wade the river.

00:26:03.561 --> 00:26:04.817
ASHLY: "Wade the wiver"?

00:26:04.817 --> 00:26:11.038
IVAN: Wade the wiver! To get across to the city.
Not even bothering to look for a bridge.

00:26:11.038 --> 00:26:13.038
MATT: Sure.

00:26:13.038 --> 00:26:16.288
MARISHA: You know we don't use no dirty human-made
contraptions.

00:26:16.288 --> 00:26:19.948
ASHLY: Wait, wait, wait, why don't we just swim?!

00:26:19.948 --> 00:26:29.682
MARISHA: No, no, no, look: the Snizz can do a lot
of things. The Snizz does not swim. Not very

00:26:29.682 --> 00:26:31.288
confident in my swimming abilities.

00:26:31.288 --> 00:26:33.135
PHIL: I'm not sure the Snizz can do a lot of things!

00:26:33.135 --> 00:26:34.615
(thunder)

00:26:34.615 --> 00:26:37.538
IVAN: Oh, Zarongel smiles on us again, yay.

00:26:37.538 --> 00:26:39.682
MATT: As you guys glance from the flash--

00:26:39.682 --> 00:26:41.818
IVAN: Smite another tree, Zarongel! Sorry.

00:26:41.818 --> 00:26:45.949
MATT: It's okay. You see the bolt of lightning
strike a distant watchtower on the far side of the

00:26:45.949 --> 00:26:49.243
city that has a rod specifically to pull these
types of things out of the way.

00:26:49.243 --> 00:26:50.682
IVAN: Stupid idea.

00:26:50.682 --> 00:26:54.542
MATT: Glancing over, I'll have you guys roll a
perception check if you could. Everybody go ahead

00:26:54.542 --> 00:26:56.443
and roll perception.

00:26:56.443 --> 00:27:03.500
IVAN: Solid 17.

00:27:03.500 --> 00:27:08.007
ASHLY: 17.

00:27:08.007 --> 00:27:09.171
PHIL: Ten.

00:27:09.171 --> 00:27:10.509
TALIESIN: Natural one!

00:27:10.509 --> 00:27:11.861
MATT: Marisha?

00:27:11.861 --> 00:27:13.118
MARISHA: Ten.

00:27:13.118 --> 00:27:14.615
IVAN: 17.

00:27:14.615 --> 00:27:19.637
MATT: All right, so we got two 17s here, from you guys.
Al right, so as you guys are glancing about, you

00:27:19.637 --> 00:27:24.045
can see the city before you and it generally loses
most interest to all of you, especially Mezek,

00:27:24.045 --> 00:27:27.774
who, while your direction sense has been great
today, once you get to the actual location of your

00:27:27.774 --> 00:27:32.093
intent, you've lost all interest and you're
playing in the mud. The thick clay on the side of

00:27:32.093 --> 00:27:34.050
the river smeared on your face.

00:27:34.050 --> 00:27:36.397
IVAN: I want to kick any sculptures that he makes
out of mud.

00:27:36.397 --> 00:27:37.656
MATT: Okay.

00:27:37.656 --> 00:27:39.129
PHIL: Make sure it's mud!

00:27:39.129 --> 00:27:43.006
IVAN: Whatcha going to do about it, Mezek, whatcha
going to do about it?

00:27:43.006 --> 00:27:45.088
TALIESIN: Wait 'til you're asleep.

00:27:45.088 --> 00:27:53.186
MATT: Now you're not sure if it was mud because it
spooked you a little. So, the two of you glance

00:27:53.186 --> 00:27:57.717
over and you can see there are two bridges that
lead to the city itself that go over, but both of

00:27:57.717 --> 00:28:01.424
them look extremely heavily guarded. You have two
passes of three sets of guards that walk back and

00:28:01.424 --> 00:28:08.573
forth, armed with crossbows. You guys do-- As the
midday rain is still pouring down and it's causing

00:28:08.573 --> 00:28:13.175
the surface of the river to spatter, you can see
there's a little bit of what would have been a

00:28:13.175 --> 00:28:16.469
morning marine fog that's been burning off
since it went out there so it's no longer really

00:28:16.469 --> 00:28:23.719
at your disposal. However, you two do notice,
right across the river against the bank before it

00:28:23.719 --> 00:28:30.878
rises up to the top of the city itself, you see,
barely visible, the outside of a metal grate. Some

00:28:30.878 --> 00:28:37.969
sort of a subterranean sewer or tunnel system that
is sealed shut across the way. It's a good, say,

00:28:37.969 --> 00:28:43.488
80 to 100 feet across that river right now and it
does have quite the current to it, probably

00:28:43.488 --> 00:28:45.515
because the rain's been pouring for most of the
morning.

00:28:45.515 --> 00:28:48.045
IVAN: Goblins plus sewers equals awesome.

00:28:48.045 --> 00:28:51.241
MATT: Smart one here, doing the math.

00:28:51.241 --> 00:28:55.965
IVAN: Yes. So we have to wade the river in order
to get to the grate?

00:28:55.965 --> 00:28:58.960
MATT: What do you want to do to get there? It's up
to you guys.

00:28:58.960 --> 00:29:00.636
ASHLY: Do we have to go to the grate?

00:29:00.636 --> 00:29:01.811
MATT: You don't have to.

00:29:01.811 --> 00:29:06.888
ASHLY: I don't like lightning, and I really want
to use my hammer. As a result. Those two things

00:29:06.888 --> 00:29:08.696
are connected, don't question.

00:29:08.696 --> 00:29:10.438
PHIL: Can you swim with your hammer?

00:29:10.438 --> 00:29:12.401
ASHLY: I just want to smash the dudes guarding the
bridge.

00:29:12.401 --> 00:29:16.811
PHIL: Are there guards on both bridges? Are there
guards on both bridges?

00:29:16.811 --> 00:29:18.388
MATT: Yes.

00:29:18.388 --> 00:29:27.266
IVAN: Look, I think, just putting it out there,
that grate is really, really good because there's

00:29:27.266 --> 00:29:31.495
no people in there. And humans are dumb-dumbs.

00:29:31.495 --> 00:29:35.112
ASHLY: Are you not goblins?! Do you not like
smashing humans' skulls?!

00:29:35.112 --> 00:29:41.109
IVAN: I like, pewpewpew human's skulls. I don't
like to get in all up in the face thing, Piglet.

00:29:41.109 --> 00:29:43.083
ASHLY: I think he's a coward!

00:29:43.083 --> 00:29:53.045
IVAN: How dare you call Grizznak the Great a
coward! And I want to-- I don't have magic mouth--

00:29:53.045 --> 00:29:58.192
I want to Grease her. I want to cover her in
grease.

00:29:58.192 --> 00:30:00.245
PHIL: Who doesn't?

00:30:00.245 --> 00:30:02.479
TALIESIN: This got weird quick. All right.

00:30:02.479 --> 00:30:05.599
ASHLY: Do I roll to not get greased?

00:30:05.599 --> 00:30:08.500
PHIL: We dive in the brambles and then begin to
grease each other.

00:30:08.500 --> 00:30:13.681
MATT: It has started. The game has indeed
started.

00:30:13.681 --> 00:30:18.257
IVAN: "I will show you true power!" As grease
spurts out from my hand.

00:30:18.257 --> 00:30:20.505
ASHLY: I will roll against grease.

00:30:20.505 --> 00:30:26.421
MATT: Yes, for you, I need you to make a reflex
saving throw. So go ahead and roll a d20 and add

00:30:26.421 --> 00:30:27.547
your reflex.

00:30:27.547 --> 00:30:31.012
ASHLY: 19, I will have you know. Plus my reflex.

00:30:31.012 --> 00:30:33.000
TALIESIN: There's a little box right there.

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:34.283
ASHLY: Oh, five.

00:30:34.283 --> 00:30:35.558
MATT: You rolled a 19?

00:30:35.558 --> 00:30:36.710
ASHLY: 19 plus five.

00:30:36.710 --> 00:30:38.096
PHIL: Yeah, she rolled a 19.

00:30:38.096 --> 00:30:42.919
MATT: You go and (raspberry noise) begin to spew
grease from the outside of your goblin staff--

00:30:42.919 --> 00:30:50.325
Piglet, however, a little ball of anger and
muscular rage, instead darts out of the way,

00:30:50.325 --> 00:30:54.605
slamming into the side of the sandbank that you
are currently playing in the mud and clay with,

00:30:54.605 --> 00:31:00.209
causing that to collapse partially onto you. You
are now partially buried under the clay. And what

00:31:00.209 --> 00:31:03.190
little bit of your head is pointing out is now
being sprayed with grease.

00:31:03.190 --> 00:31:07.254
TALIESIN: (sputters, coughs)

00:31:07.254 --> 00:31:19.773
IVAN: Oh, sorry. That was meant for Piglet. Okay.
High five! All is forgiven.

00:31:19.773 --> 00:31:23.260
PHIL: I say we do the opposite of whatever he
wants to do.

00:31:23.260 --> 00:31:26.349
ASHLY: So we're going to get the humans! We're
going to smash 'em with hammers and other sharp--

00:31:26.349 --> 00:31:28.638
TALIESIN: We're supposed to be stealthy, can we do
it and be stealthy?

00:31:28.638 --> 00:31:30.336
IVAN: I think stealth is better.

00:31:30.336 --> 00:31:32.583
TALIESIN: Is there a way to smash humans with
stealth?

00:31:32.583 --> 00:31:35.552
PHIL: How many guards are there?

00:31:35.552 --> 00:31:39.556
MATT: Looking, there's about six to each bridge
that you can see.

00:31:39.556 --> 00:31:44.165
ASHLY: Can I tell if it's more advantageous for
any reason to go through the bridge

00:31:44.165 --> 00:31:46.158
versus the sewer?

00:31:46.158 --> 00:31:47.419
IVAN: Combat.

00:31:47.419 --> 00:31:56.054
MATT: It's hard to say. A town full of people--
make an intelligence check.

00:31:56.054 --> 00:31:57.809
Go ahead and roll a d20.

00:31:57.809 --> 00:31:59.637
ASHLY: This is not going to go well!

00:31:59.637 --> 00:32:01.909
IVAN: Roll for comedy.

00:32:01.909 --> 00:32:03.870
ASHLY: One!

00:32:03.870 --> 00:32:06.990
MATT: Natural one. What?

00:32:06.990 --> 00:32:08.390
ASHLY: Ten. Ten altogether.

00:32:08.390 --> 00:32:19.325
MATT: Ten altogether? Okay. So you know humans.
You know them pretty well. And they're tall, but

00:32:19.325 --> 00:32:24.750
they're pretty weak. There's a lot of them on
these bridges. That's a lot of really, really weak

00:32:24.750 --> 00:32:33.413
things. Conversely, in the sewer, who knows what's
in there? There's filth, there's scavenging

00:32:33.413 --> 00:32:42.348
pieces, and possibly dirty humans. So it's up to
you. Do you want to go out in a delightful goblin

00:32:42.348 --> 00:32:47.700
blaze of glory? Or do you want to go out in a
delightfully messy goblin blaze of glory?

00:32:47.700 --> 00:32:50.063
ASHLY: The disembodied voice makes a good point,
let's go in the sewer.

00:32:50.063 --> 00:32:53.034
(laughter)

00:32:53.034 --> 00:32:55.696
PHIL: Right! Let's drown rather than be stabbed!

00:32:55.696 --> 00:32:57.375
MARISHA: How are we going to cross?

00:32:57.375 --> 00:32:59.595
IVAN: Drowning is the way Zarongel would want us
to go out.

00:32:59.595 --> 00:33:02.369
PHIL: I thought you were going to build us some
flotsam-floaty-flotsam.

00:33:02.369 --> 00:33:07.091
MARISHA: I'm really nervous about water. I like
burning things.

00:33:07.091 --> 00:33:08.453
ASHLY: I can carry you, I'm strong.

00:33:08.453 --> 00:33:11.131
TALIESIN: I want to look around and see if there's
anything to add to this flotsam pile.

00:33:11.131 --> 00:33:12.667
MATT: Sure, make a survival check.

00:33:12.667 --> 00:33:16.902
IVAN: Can Snizzler and Mezek help me to--

00:33:16.902 --> 00:33:18.258
MARISHA: Build a rough raft.

00:33:18.258 --> 00:33:19.403
IVAN: Yeah, to build a rough raft.

00:33:19.403 --> 00:33:20.384
TALIESIN: Seven.

00:33:20.384 --> 00:33:21.651
MARISHA: I roll as well.

00:33:21.651 --> 00:33:23.510
IVAN: 17.

00:33:23.510 --> 00:33:28.313
MARISHA. What am I adding here? Don't I have 
good stuff for tinkering?

00:33:28.313 --> 00:33:32.038
IVAN: Do you want to tinker? I think this is
survival.

00:33:32.038 --> 00:33:34.944
MARISHA: Oh, survival. Ten. But he rolled pretty
good.

00:33:34.944 --> 00:33:40.351
MATT: Okay, it takes you guys the better part of
about 30 minutes or so as you find things in the

00:33:40.351 --> 00:33:44.638
nearby edge of the woods. You start pulling up the
bits of clay and sand that you were buried under

00:33:44.638 --> 00:33:47.951
as something caught your foot, and it was a bit
pointy but you found a chunk of driftwood that looks

00:33:47.951 --> 00:33:52.825
to have made its way there. I would like you all
to make a stealth check, as you are now having to

00:33:52.825 --> 00:33:55.869
dart in and out of the forest to find material.

00:33:55.869 --> 00:34:02.006
ASHLY: 18 plus 14.

00:34:02.006 --> 00:34:04.630
PHIL: Three plus 20.

00:34:04.630 --> 00:34:08.257
MATT: Plus 20?! Goblins! Oh my god.

00:34:08.257 --> 00:34:11.212
TALIESIN: 36. Damn!

00:34:11.212 --> 00:34:12.460
MARISHA: 32.

00:34:12.460 --> 00:34:13.431
IVAN: 33.

00:34:13.431 --> 00:34:18.511
MATT: Okay! You guys deftly, running back and
forth along the bank of river, grabbing

00:34:18.511 --> 00:34:23.206
what you can out of the sand and the dirt,
apparently entirely unnoticed as there even is a

00:34:23.206 --> 00:34:29.939
series of guards that come by, four of them, that
just walk on past. One of them you swear stared into

00:34:29.939 --> 00:34:31.977
the forest right at you and went--

00:34:31.977 --> 00:34:35.010
MARISHA: Be garden gnomes you guys, garden
gnomes!

00:34:35.010 --> 00:34:40.266
MATT: "Hey, Steven! Did you leave some gnomes out
here? Stupid gnomes."

00:34:40.266 --> 00:34:42.346
And they keep on walking past.

00:34:42.346 --> 00:34:45.363
MARISHA: Haha, garden gnome act gets 'em every
time! Heh, heh, heh.

00:34:45.363 --> 00:34:53.400
MATT: "Wait, I want some garden gnomes!" And he
comes back in. "Nah, they look filthy. All green.

00:34:53.400 --> 00:34:57.322
"From the mold. Stupid garden gnomes." And he keeps
going.

00:34:57.322 --> 00:35:02.027
IVAN: He's the first one that's going to get
pew-pewed.

00:35:02.027 --> 00:35:04.668
MARISHA: I agree. Boom-boom! Heh.

00:35:04.668 --> 00:35:06.282
IVAN: Boom-boom, pew-pew.

00:35:06.282 --> 00:35:08.776
TALIESIN: Two arms, two legs, one head, we'll find
him at the end.

00:35:08.776 --> 00:35:12.814
IVAN: I've got his face. I've got his beady face.

00:35:12.814 --> 00:35:19.271
MATT: So you've crafted this "raft". It's less of
a raft and more of a pool noodle buoy thing.

00:35:19.271 --> 00:35:25.343
IVAN: Yes! Yes, let's all get on a pool noodle
which is basically a giant branch.

00:35:25.343 --> 00:35:30.380
PHIL: That's the first smart thing you've said all
day!

00:35:30.380 --> 00:35:37.248
MATT: This is less like Tom Hanks in Castaway,
more Gollum in the river. You guys are having to

00:35:37.248 --> 00:35:42.107
hold on and move across. However, as you push it
into the water, it is buoyant and it does seem to

00:35:42.107 --> 00:35:47.558
carry you. The current does tend to push it, so
you guys are going to have to guide it across the

00:35:47.558 --> 00:35:51.496
current. If I could have you all make a swim
check.

00:35:51.496 --> 00:35:56.182
MARISHA: Oh, I'm so bad at this! I'm really not
the best swimmer, you guys.

00:35:56.182 --> 00:35:57.348
ASHLY: 11.

00:35:57.348 --> 00:36:01.223
MARISHA: Oh boy, this is so bad!

00:36:01.223 --> 00:36:02.511
MATT: Five?

00:36:02.511 --> 00:36:05.758
PHIL: 12.

00:36:05.758 --> 00:36:07.381
TALIESIN: 21.

00:36:07.381 --> 00:36:17.184
MARISHA: Four. I have a fear of swimming.

00:36:17.184 --> 00:36:19.882
PHIL: Sorry, 17.

00:36:19.882 --> 00:36:26.617
MATT: 17, okay. So you guys are pushing along. The
three of you are back to back, feels like goblin

00:36:26.617 --> 00:36:28.010
power, getting in there.

00:36:28.010 --> 00:36:30.684
PHIL: Oh, I swallowed a fish! (cough)

00:36:30.684 --> 00:36:32.337
TALIESIN: Share! Share!

00:36:32.337 --> 00:36:35.332
MATT: You glance over your shoulder and see the
two of them going, (yelling).

00:36:35.332 --> 00:36:37.091
IVAN and MARISHA: (yelling)

00:36:37.091 --> 00:36:39.774
MARISHA: I hate water!

00:36:39.774 --> 00:36:43.012
PHIL: Our fearless leaders!

00:36:43.012 --> 00:36:45.123
ASHLY: That feels perfectly appropriate.

00:36:45.123 --> 00:36:48.788
MATT: As part of the screaming echoes out, you
hear someone in the distance go,

00:36:48.788 --> 00:36:50.242
"D'you hear that?"

00:36:50.242 --> 00:36:52.236
ASHLY: Shut up! Shut up!

00:36:52.236 --> 00:36:53.572
IVAN: (screams quietly)

00:36:53.572 --> 00:36:56.131
MARISHA: (hyperventilates quietly)

00:36:56.131 --> 00:37:05.980
MATT: Okay. You guys stop moving and the current
carries you, and you slowly begin to rotate in the

00:37:05.980 --> 00:37:12.009
water and you're being rained on in the face. And
you see a couple guards look as you drift under

00:37:12.009 --> 00:37:18.015
the bridge on the far left side of where you
entered and they look down and go, "Man, they'll

00:37:18.015 --> 00:37:25.679
"throw away anything these days. Perfectly good
piece of wood." As it drifts under the bridge, you

00:37:25.679 --> 00:37:31.137
guys have a moment to go ahead and try and push to
shore. Go ahead and roll swim checks again.

00:37:31.137 --> 00:37:32.527
MARISHA: I'm so afraid.

00:37:32.527 --> 00:37:33.667
IVAN: Better.

00:37:33.667 --> 00:37:35.468
TALIESIN: 16.

00:37:35.468 --> 00:37:36.957
IVAN: 20.

00:37:36.957 --> 00:37:38.458
MARISHA: Negative one.

00:37:38.458 --> 00:37:40.161
MATT: Haha! It's okay.

00:37:40.161 --> 00:37:41.634
PHIL: What, are you made of lead?!

00:37:41.634 --> 00:37:45.973
MARISHA: I have a negative four swim, I just
want to point that out. (cries)

00:37:45.973 --> 00:37:53.492
MATT: So as you're pushing there, you're making
headway, except for the fact that Snizzler is

00:37:53.492 --> 00:37:57.153
going like, (yelling) and pushing your heads
under, trying to climb out of the water.

00:37:57.153 --> 00:38:00.141
IVAN: Stop it! Stop! Stop it!

00:38:00.141 --> 00:38:05.012
ASHLY: I say we kill her. We cut our losses? What?
Am I right?

00:38:05.012 --> 00:38:07.820
PHIL: Let's just knock her out, we'll need someone
to carry all of her stuff.

00:38:07.820 --> 00:38:09.413
ASHLY: I can carry it! I'm strong!

00:38:09.413 --> 00:38:13.012
MATT: As the splashing and chaos hits, you guys
(impact noise) hit the sandbank on the other side

00:38:13.012 --> 00:38:15.740
of the river. You have managed to cross it
primarily.

00:38:15.740 --> 00:38:22.947
MARISHA: Snizzler vomits. As soon as he hits land
(vomit noises).

00:38:22.947 --> 00:38:26.393
TALIESIN: I want to go through the vomit to see if
there's anything interesting in there.

00:38:26.393 --> 00:38:29.074
IVAN: I was going to say I'm-- I fight to get to
the vomit.

00:38:29.074 --> 00:38:30.299
TALIESIN: Yeah we'll fight, we'll fight.

00:38:30.299 --> 00:38:31.455
IVAN: We'll fight for the vomit.

00:38:31.455 --> 00:38:34.626
MATT: I want both of you guys to roll initiative
to see who gets to the vomit first.

00:38:34.626 --> 00:38:35.619
IVAN: Fuck!

00:38:35.619 --> 00:38:36.945
TALIESIN: What's-- oh. 11.

00:38:36.945 --> 00:38:38.622
MATT: What did you get?

00:38:38.622 --> 00:38:40.326
IVAN: I got 11!

00:38:40.326 --> 00:38:42.665
MATT: You guys both--

00:38:42.665 --> 00:38:44.421
PHIL: Conk!

00:38:44.421 --> 00:38:48.855
TALIESIN: (cackling) (raspberry noise)

00:38:48.855 --> 00:38:53.658
MATT: And with that, Mezek grabs a hand scoop up
of this crusted sand--

00:38:53.658 --> 00:38:55.039
TALIESIN: I have a jug.

00:38:55.039 --> 00:38:58.142
MATT: Puts it in the jug. Closes it off.

00:38:58.142 --> 00:38:59.921
TALIESIN: I'll go through it later.

00:38:59.921 --> 00:39:01.630
IVAN: Being a goblin is amazing.

00:39:01.630 --> 00:39:11.394
MATT: At which point you hear another voice say,
"Did you hear laughing? I'm going to go check."

00:39:11.394 --> 00:39:13.434
And you hear a number of footsteps coming your
way.

00:39:13.434 --> 00:39:15.441
IVAN: I'm going to cast Ghost Sound.

00:39:15.441 --> 00:39:16.365
MATT: Okay.

00:39:16.365 --> 00:39:18.840
IVAN: To see if I can distract them away.

00:39:18.840 --> 00:39:20.474
MATT: What kind of sound are you producing?

00:39:20.474 --> 00:39:25.948
IVAN: I'm going to produce a righteous
merriment-making sound.

00:39:25.948 --> 00:39:29.293
MATT: On the direction of...?

00:39:29.293 --> 00:39:31.863
IVAN: It sounds like drunken storytelling.

00:39:31.863 --> 00:39:38.780
MATT: Okay. So, at this point you guys watch as
Grizznak spins around, points his staff forward,

00:39:38.780 --> 00:39:46.030
and quite a ways away you hear this boisterous
(indistinct drunk storytelling) start blasting

00:39:46.030 --> 00:39:51.156
from the opposite side of the bridge, up near the
rocks that begin to meet the base of

00:39:51.156 --> 00:39:56.116
the city's foundation. The footsteps shift and you
hear them going across the wood planks above you

00:39:56.116 --> 00:40:01.490
on the bridge, in the direction that he set. Now
is your time to go ahead and dart for the

00:40:01.490 --> 00:40:06.488
grate on the outside of the sewer. Go ahead and roll
stealth checks, all you guys.

00:40:06.488 --> 00:40:07.770
IVAN: Stealth checks?

00:40:07.770 --> 00:40:09.221
TALIESIN: That's leaning.

00:40:09.221 --> 00:40:10.943
ASHLY: 23.

00:40:10.943 --> 00:40:12.065
MATT: 23?

00:40:12.065 --> 00:40:13.259
PHIL: 40.

00:40:13.259 --> 00:40:17.691
MATT: Jesus! You vanish from time and space!

00:40:17.691 --> 00:40:20.534
TALIESIN: He folds to be one-dimensional.

00:40:20.534 --> 00:40:24.244
MATT: You have a fifth-dimensional goblin on your
team now.

00:40:24.244 --> 00:40:25.510
TALIESIN: 31.

00:40:25.510 --> 00:40:26.928
MARISHA: 19.

00:40:26.928 --> 00:40:28.144
IVAN: 22.

00:40:28.144 --> 00:40:31.194
MATT: Okay. You guys, darting through the rain,
using the edge of the rocky--

00:40:31.194 --> 00:40:33.083
PHIL: What took you so long?

00:40:33.083 --> 00:40:38.157
MATT: You get to the grate, and there is indeed
Browntooth sitting there picking his teeth with

00:40:38.157 --> 00:40:39.544
one of his blades.

00:40:39.544 --> 00:40:41.894
TALIESIN: How did he do that?

00:40:41.894 --> 00:40:43.766
ASHLY: What I don't-- you were just-- and then--

00:40:43.766 --> 00:40:47.347
PHIL: Sometimes it pays to be quiet.

00:40:47.347 --> 00:40:51.516
ASHLY: I think we all learned a valuable lesson.

00:40:51.516 --> 00:40:54.889
PHIL: Now who's going to rip off this grate?

00:40:54.889 --> 00:40:55.815
ASHLY: Me!!

00:40:55.815 --> 00:40:57.196
PHIL: Oh, god!

00:40:57.196 --> 00:41:00.127
MATT: Piglet, go ahead and make a strength check.
Roll and add your strength modifier.

00:41:00.127 --> 00:41:01.796
ASHLY: (laughing) 25.

00:41:01.796 --> 00:41:09.460
MATT: 25! With one hand, Piglet, holding the hammer
in one hand, grabs the grate, spins it in place,

00:41:09.460 --> 00:41:16.460
sending rust and metal sparks, and throws it
behind her, (sploosh).

00:41:16.460 --> 00:41:18.247
ASHLY: And I go like this.

00:41:18.247 --> 00:41:21.241
PHIL: Again, I would like to mention about the
being quiet part.

00:41:21.241 --> 00:41:27.822
IVAN: I take a moment to absorb all of that
amazing that happened right there.

00:41:27.822 --> 00:41:29.581
ASHLY: You're welcome, you're welcome.

00:41:29.581 --> 00:41:36.632
IVAN: Yeah, Grizznak, not being the strongest of
the bunch, is easily swayed by intense feats of

00:41:36.632 --> 00:41:38.022
strength. Oh, my!

00:41:38.022 --> 00:41:40.962
PHIL: Grizznak, you look like you want to grease
her again in a whole new way!

00:41:40.962 --> 00:41:47.344
IVAN: Wishes he had another Grease spell prepared!
Woo! Okay.

00:41:47.344 --> 00:41:53.975
MATT: At which point you hear the howl of distant
wind and the droplets of condensation within the

00:41:53.975 --> 00:42:02.338
depths of this sewage system beckoning to you as
an entry portal to this city. Secretly, privately,

00:42:02.338 --> 00:42:06.355
and hopefully to wherever this festival is
happening where you can gather this "Storm Rock."

00:42:06.355 --> 00:42:08.446
IVAN: Smells just like home.

00:42:08.446 --> 00:42:10.488
PHIL: Yes, moldy and clammy.

00:42:10.488 --> 00:42:16.050
IVAN: Yay. Hey, do you remember when we were in
juvie and they threw us down in the "lock box"?

00:42:16.050 --> 00:42:17.336
For like a month?

00:42:17.336 --> 00:42:19.102
MARISHA: Oh, dude, and we got so blazed.

00:42:19.102 --> 00:42:20.262
IVAN: We got so blazed!

00:42:20.262 --> 00:42:21.562
MARISHA: That was so good, man.

00:42:21.562 --> 00:42:23.096
IVAN: Yeah, this reminds me of that.

00:42:23.096 --> 00:42:24.676
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, I agree.

00:42:24.676 --> 00:42:26.255
ASHLY: I feel excluded.

00:42:26.255 --> 00:42:27.878
(laughter)

00:42:27.878 --> 00:42:29.725
ASHLY: Remember when I ripped the grate off of the
thing?

00:42:29.725 --> 00:42:32.213
PHIL: Oh, those were the days.

00:42:32.213 --> 00:42:34.375
TALIESIN: When did that happen? I don't remember
that.

00:42:34.375 --> 00:42:36.927
IVAN: I think we're all going to want to sneak--

00:42:36.927 --> 00:42:38.281
PHIL: Let's go inside.

00:42:38.281 --> 00:42:39.524
IVAN: Sneak around inside.

00:42:39.524 --> 00:42:43.405
TALIESIN: I want to keep my eyes peeled for
things that might be useful or that can contain alcohol.

00:42:43.405 --> 00:42:49.902
MATT: Okay. Good to know. You guys step your way
inside the sewer. The slick stone structure of it

00:42:49.902 --> 00:42:58.408
has lots of residue buildup from various minerals
that have come through, as well as various degrees

00:42:58.408 --> 00:43:04.839
of wastewater that have found their way to the
river. The smell is horrible for anyone but you

00:43:04.839 --> 00:43:13.430
guys. It's a familiar scent. As you make your way
inside-- I'd say about 100 feet in as you're going

00:43:13.430 --> 00:43:18.400
through the darkness here-- but you guys can see
fine in the dark, this is goblin speciality.

00:43:18.400 --> 00:43:20.285
IVAN: Darkvision, guys.

00:43:20.285 --> 00:43:24.875
PHIL: I check to see if there are any insects that
are tasty-looking.

00:43:24.875 --> 00:43:30.088
MATT: Go ahead and make a perception check.

00:43:30.088 --> 00:43:32.525
PHIL: 21.

00:43:32.525 --> 00:43:44.234
MATT: All right. Glancing about, you do see a
cluster of some sort of an egg sac that is pushed

00:43:44.234 --> 00:43:52.804
up into the corner along the curved rotation of this
duct. It's roughly the size of a large melon. And

00:43:52.804 --> 00:43:54.358
it twitches--

00:43:54.358 --> 00:43:56.172
IVAN: I will burn it with Flare.

00:43:56.172 --> 00:43:57.192
MARISHA: Yeah!

00:43:57.192 --> 00:43:58.583
ASHLY: Don't burn it, we're going to eat it!

00:43:58.583 --> 00:44:01.627
MATT: As you're looking up at it, (fwoosh) it
bursts into flames.

00:44:01.627 --> 00:44:03.183
ASHLY: What the heck!!

00:44:03.183 --> 00:44:06.355
PHIL: Who burns food?!

00:44:06.355 --> 00:44:11.754
IVAN: Roasted spiders are best spiders. See, you
guys aren't smart, so you don't know that burning

00:44:11.754 --> 00:44:14.246
spiders makes them that much tastier.

00:44:14.246 --> 00:44:16.118
ASHLY: Are there spiders left to eat?

00:44:16.118 --> 00:44:23.417
MATT: You go and glance and the slight tiny series
of squeaks you hear as the hundreds of tiny spider

00:44:23.417 --> 00:44:31.384
young have burned to their end. There is a nice
waft of cooked scent that hits your nose. And the

00:44:31.384 --> 00:44:39.577
rumbling in your tummy takes over, as you guys all
leap in at once, grabbing small chunks of what you can.

00:44:39.577 --> 00:44:42.278
MARISHA: This is the best, when it's crispy on the
outside but gooey on the inside.

00:44:42.278 --> 00:44:44.140
PHIL: I wish there was tartar sauce.

00:44:44.140 --> 00:44:45.579
TALIESIN: "Oh wait!" I open up the jar--

00:44:45.579 --> 00:44:48.251
(horrified laughter)

00:44:48.251 --> 00:44:50.556
TALIESIN: Smear some on his spider chunk.

00:44:50.556 --> 00:44:52.083
PHIL: Close enough!

00:44:52.083 --> 00:44:56.322
IVAN: Did you season our birds spider egglettes
with vomit?

00:44:56.322 --> 00:44:59.854
ASHLY: Don't knock it. This is the good shit.

00:44:59.854 --> 00:45:01.487
IVAN: I burned it for you!

00:45:01.487 --> 00:45:03.207
TALIESIN: I won it fair and square!

00:45:03.207 --> 00:45:09.963
IVAN: I'm going to cast arcane mark on the side of
this wall and mark that we were here.

00:45:09.963 --> 00:45:17.433
Particularly, "Grizznak the Greatest was here," is
what I'm going to mark. But it really looks like a

00:45:17.433 --> 00:45:19.680
giant butt with like a cloud--

00:45:19.680 --> 00:45:21.478
TALIESIN: I was about to say, can you read and
write?

00:45:21.478 --> 00:45:22.768
PHIL: No words?

00:45:22.768 --> 00:45:29.357
IVAN: No, no words. The symbol for "Grizznak the
Greatest" is a goblin with two cheeky farts and a

00:45:29.357 --> 00:45:30.608
cloud coming out of it.

00:45:30.608 --> 00:45:32.532
TALIESIN: I was imagining a goblin dick-butt.

00:45:32.532 --> 00:45:34.065
(laughter)

00:45:34.065 --> 00:45:36.583
IVAN: That is the mark of Grizznak the Great.

00:45:36.583 --> 00:45:40.676
PHIL: A goblin dick looks like a human dick, but
with spurs.

00:45:40.676 --> 00:45:44.178
TALIESIN: Oh, god! Oh! Thank you, thank you.

00:45:44.178 --> 00:45:46.545
MATT: We learned a very valuable lesson this
evening.

00:45:46.545 --> 00:45:48.794
IVAN: Of goblin physiology.

00:45:48.794 --> 00:45:50.529
PHIL: That's how you know it's love.

00:45:50.529 --> 00:45:52.244
TALIESIN: No!

00:45:52.244 --> 00:45:53.838
MATT: Tumblr, get on that.

00:45:53.838 --> 00:45:57.317
TALIESIN: Oh, god. Too late. Moving on.

00:45:57.317 --> 00:46:00.493
PHIL: I can't unsee it in my mind!

00:46:00.493 --> 00:46:04.091
TALIESIN: You won't have to, you'll go on the internet in
about an hour, and it'll be there. There's nothing

00:46:04.091 --> 00:46:05.206
that can be done anymore.

00:46:05.206 --> 00:46:06.950
MATT: You did this, Phil. You did this.

00:46:06.950 --> 00:46:09.523
TALIESIN: We're not kidding. We're not even
kidding a little.

00:46:09.523 --> 00:46:15.228
IVAN: Oh, all right. Grizznak the Great has left
his Arcane Mark. A goblin dick-butt.

00:46:15.228 --> 00:46:19.893
MATT: Progressing forward for the next couple
hundred feet into this slick sewer, making your

00:46:19.893 --> 00:46:29.145
way along embankments where bits of clutter,
broken sticks, chunks of wayward stone and mortar

00:46:29.145 --> 00:46:37.622
pieces that have washed down here have built these
small half-walls of junk that have mucked up the side.

00:46:37.622 --> 00:46:44.426
MARISHA: Snizzler takes a firecracker that he has
and secretly lights it and throws it behind him

00:46:44.426 --> 00:46:46.306
real fast without telling anybody.

00:46:46.306 --> 00:46:55.557
MATT: Okay. You guys walk forward until
(explosion) you all glance over your shoulder real fast--

00:46:55.557 --> 00:46:57.180
TALIESIN: I attack.

00:46:57.180 --> 00:46:58.646
(laughter)

00:46:58.646 --> 00:47:00.925
MATT: Go ahead and roll an attack.

00:47:00.925 --> 00:47:02.072
TALIESIN: Thank you.

00:47:02.072 --> 00:47:04.100
IVAN: "I attack the darkness!"

00:47:04.100 --> 00:47:05.833
(laughter)

00:47:05.833 --> 00:47:07.153
TALIESIN: 14.

00:47:07.153 --> 00:47:13.178
MATT: 14, okay. You turn around real fast as a
piece of rock that is set loose from this small

00:47:13.178 --> 00:47:19.019
firecracker explosion, whips through the air and
you punch it with your fist.

00:47:19.019 --> 00:47:21.514
Go ahead and roll damage.

00:47:21.514 --> 00:47:26.200
IVAN: I forgot he's a goblin monk. He punches
things.

00:47:26.200 --> 00:47:28.179
TALIESIN: That's five.

00:47:28.179 --> 00:47:38.405
MATT: With that, you turn this piece of mildewed,
slimy, sewage-encrusted stone to dust as it (poof)

00:47:38.405 --> 00:47:43.522
in front of you. Holding your fist as it shakes
there quivering, your eyes open. Any buzz you may

00:47:43.522 --> 00:47:49.589
have carried from your morning alcohol has waned
for now and you are far more awake and conscious--

00:47:49.589 --> 00:47:51.299
with a mild headache.

00:47:51.299 --> 00:47:57.441
IVAN: Guys, we're into this campaign and so far
the only thing we've defeated is a rock. This is

00:47:57.441 --> 00:47:59.017
the best goblin campaign.

00:47:59.017 --> 00:48:00.725
(laughter)

00:48:00.725 --> 00:48:05.438
MATT: The path does split here now and divides to
the right and left.

00:48:05.438 --> 00:48:07.652
ASHLY: Can I roll perception?

00:48:07.652 --> 00:48:08.822
MATT: To see...?

00:48:08.822 --> 00:48:11.104
ASHLY: If there's anything different about them?

00:48:11.104 --> 00:48:12.620
MATT: Sure, go for it.

00:48:12.620 --> 00:48:16.730
ASHLY: 17 plus four is 21.

00:48:16.730 --> 00:48:22.265
MATT: Piglet, you're the instinctual tracker. Most
goblins hunt with traps, you hunt with teeth.

00:48:22.265 --> 00:48:23.503
ASHLY: Nice.

00:48:23.503 --> 00:48:29.375
MATT: So you get down and (sniffing) begin getting
into the muck and pushing it aside. Less than a

00:48:29.375 --> 00:48:34.555
visual perspective here, you can smell that the
bulk of the waste that comes through here comes

00:48:34.555 --> 00:48:38.532
from the left path. That probably means more
waste, means more people.

00:48:38.532 --> 00:48:41.276
IVAN: More waste, more people.

00:48:41.276 --> 00:48:43.064
PHIL: So we should go away from the people...

00:48:43.064 --> 00:48:48.866
ASHLY: Wait, what are we doing?

00:48:48.866 --> 00:48:50.218
MARISHA: Yeah, why are we here?

00:48:50.218 --> 00:48:51.917
IVAN: Get the blue stone.

00:48:51.917 --> 00:48:53.047
ASHLY: A rock! The rock!

00:48:53.047 --> 00:48:56.007
TALIESIN: The cracked man with the blue stone!

00:48:56.007 --> 00:49:00.846
ASHLY: Zachary! That's the guy, right?

00:49:00.846 --> 00:49:03.705
PHIL: He's in blue. He's got a rock.

00:49:03.705 --> 00:49:10.749
IVAN: I remember he's in a birch. Like a birch
tree. Right? Birch.

00:49:10.749 --> 00:49:12.267
TALIESIN: No, a church tree!

00:49:12.267 --> 00:49:14.090
IVAN: A church tree, that's right.

00:49:14.090 --> 00:49:19.531
MARISHA: And we stay under trees when there's
lightning. That's what you're thinking of.

00:49:19.531 --> 00:49:23.386
IVAN: Right. That's right, because Zarongel likes
to smite trees.

00:49:23.386 --> 00:49:26.358
PHIL: Do we go to the poop, or away from the
poop?

00:49:26.358 --> 00:49:29.623
ALL: To the poop!!

00:49:29.623 --> 00:49:32.159
IVAN: To the poop! So we go down the left channel.

00:49:32.159 --> 00:49:36.096
MATT: All right, so you guys-- (laughs) you charge
forward here--

00:49:36.096 --> 00:49:39.230
ASHLY: Wait, just to clarify, because I used my
teeth, does that mean I ate

00:49:39.230 --> 00:49:42.390
poop to find the tunnel?

00:49:42.390 --> 00:49:45.246
PHIL: Well, I hope you saved some for the rest of
us!

00:49:45.246 --> 00:49:51.329
MATT: No, you had to smear it on your teeth a
little. Pushing forward, you guys travel another

00:49:51.329 --> 00:50:00.055
80 or so feet before you come onto a large series of
waterfalls that run into a central open cesspool

00:50:00.055 --> 00:50:06.626
area that is down below this path. The actual path
diverts and goes around this central tunnel before

00:50:06.626 --> 00:50:10.678
it continues in a singular direction as the water
is pouring in.

00:50:10.678 --> 00:50:12.354
PHIL: What do we see above?

00:50:12.354 --> 00:50:13.780
MATT: Make a perception check.

00:50:13.780 --> 00:50:16.480
IVAN: Can I look as well?

00:50:16.480 --> 00:50:18.506
PHIL: 25.

00:50:18.506 --> 00:50:21.400
IVAN: 12.

00:50:21.400 --> 00:50:26.781
MATT: Okay. You look down into the cesspool and
hock a loogie to see how far it goes down.

00:50:26.781 --> 00:50:29.062
(splash noise)

00:50:29.062 --> 00:50:30.265
IVAN: 25 feet.

00:50:30.265 --> 00:50:31.952
TALIESIN: Those are not supposed to be solid.

00:50:31.952 --> 00:50:33.369
PHIL: And deep too. What? No.

00:50:33.369 --> 00:50:38.142
MATT: You glance up and you can see there is some
sort of a large, heavy grating that most of the

00:50:38.142 --> 00:50:43.397
water is pouring down from. You're not quite--
looks like a lot of the rainwater runoff from the

00:50:43.397 --> 00:50:49.879
city itself. However, you do notice a glimmer from
what little bit of light that is bouncing through

00:50:49.879 --> 00:50:54.063
from the surface and your goblin eyes catch this
little glimmer in the corner and you glance over

00:50:54.063 --> 00:50:56.725
and instinctually run towards it. You go ahead
and take a look.

00:50:56.725 --> 00:50:58.014
PHIL: It's shiny.

00:50:58.014 --> 00:51:03.743
MATT: You find a
hefty well-made human shortsword.

00:51:03.743 --> 00:51:06.726
PHIL: Dibs.

00:51:06.726 --> 00:51:08.392
IVAN: So it's a broadsword for you.

00:51:08.392 --> 00:51:10.805
PHIL: Are you saying I'm small?

00:51:10.805 --> 00:51:12.520
IVAN: I'm saying we're all small.

00:51:12.520 --> 00:51:13.636
PHIL: Oh, right.

00:51:13.636 --> 00:51:16.896
MATT: What did you roll? What was the total on
your perception check again?

00:51:16.896 --> 00:51:18.014
PHIL: 25.

00:51:18.014 --> 00:51:24.546
MATT: 25. You take this and the blade is 
perfectly clean. This place is filthy. This blade

00:51:24.546 --> 00:51:27.961
is perfectly clean, and as you glance over
underneath the waterfall you see another glimmer.

00:51:27.961 --> 00:51:34.392
PHIL: Ooh! I run and go over there. I carry the
sword with me. I don't trust these two.

00:51:34.392 --> 00:51:36.705
TALIESIN: I see that he is. I'm approaching
cautiously.

00:51:36.705 --> 00:51:39.819
ASHLY: I want to push everyone else away and get
there first.

00:51:39.819 --> 00:51:42.885
PHIL: Hey wait, you can't even see it, can you?

00:51:42.885 --> 00:51:45.195
MATT: Both of you guys make initiative checks
right now.

00:51:45.195 --> 00:51:48.114
ASHLY: 11.

00:51:48.114 --> 00:51:49.316
PHIL: Four.

00:51:49.316 --> 00:51:50.785
TALIESIN: Wait, you got plus six.

00:51:50.785 --> 00:51:51.816
PHIL: Ten.

00:51:51.816 --> 00:51:53.978
ASHLY: Oh wait. 15.

00:51:53.978 --> 00:51:58.204
MATT: So as you see this and you glance over out
of the corner of your eye, you see Piglet. Her

00:51:58.204 --> 00:52:04.087
eyes go wide and both of you have that immediate
knowledge of "me first". You both dart off around

00:52:04.087 --> 00:52:10.441
two different sides of this cistern and starting
to get there. However, Piglet, you get there first

00:52:10.441 --> 00:52:15.235
and immediately leap towards this shiny. And the
shiny is bigger than you expected.

00:52:15.235 --> 00:52:19.785
IVAN: Can I cast Mage Hand to see if I can snatch
it from all three of them or

00:52:19.785 --> 00:52:21.463
away from the two of them?

00:52:21.463 --> 00:52:23.272
MATT: Is it a five-pound maximum?

00:52:23.272 --> 00:52:24.471
IVAN: Five pounds, yeah.

00:52:24.471 --> 00:52:28.547
MATT: You go ahead and cast Mage Hand towards that
shiny and pull and (grunts) it's a little heavier

00:52:28.547 --> 00:52:33.867
than you can pull. You get there and you grab on
to it. What you notice as you get there is a set,

00:52:33.867 --> 00:52:41.399
a full set, of a breastplate armor. Human size,
giant breastplate with some shoulder pauldrons and

00:52:41.399 --> 00:52:45.022
a human ribcage on the inside of this
breastplate.

00:52:45.022 --> 00:52:46.534
ASHLY: Ooh! Ribcage.

00:52:46.534 --> 00:52:50.228
MATT: You smell it. Marrow hasn't been tapped
yet.

00:52:50.228 --> 00:52:52.947
ASHLY: Can I eat it?

00:52:52.947 --> 00:52:54.297
MATT: You can.

00:52:54.297 --> 00:52:55.972
ASHLY: I eat it.

00:52:55.972 --> 00:52:57.247
PHIL: Barbeque.

00:52:57.247 --> 00:52:58.814
ASHLY: Can I wear the armor? Is it too big for
me?

00:52:58.814 --> 00:53:01.559
MATT: It's pretty big, yeah. You could sleep in
it.

00:53:01.559 --> 00:53:04.265
PHIL: Rent it out!

00:53:04.265 --> 00:53:09.786
MATT: So you grab the ribcage, break off a couple
ribs, start gnawing on them, sucking the marrow

00:53:09.786 --> 00:53:17.781
out. You do notice, getting there and inspecting,
the ribcage is white. It is clean as well. You can

00:53:17.781 --> 00:53:23.396
see, upon close look as she is gnawing, not even
paying attention, you see these little teeth marks

00:53:23.396 --> 00:53:27.734
on it like rats have come through here and there.
Overall, the bone is perfectly clean. The armor

00:53:27.734 --> 00:53:31.500
itself is spotless, looks like it's been perfectly
polished.

00:53:31.500 --> 00:53:37.049
ASHLY: This marrow's real good. You guys are
missing out.

00:53:37.049 --> 00:53:39.143
MARISHA: Pass me a rib.

00:53:39.143 --> 00:53:46.522
PHIL: Is there any of the armor that any of us can
fit?

00:53:46.522 --> 00:53:52.063
MATT: You could try and pull scrap from it if you
wanted to try and scavenge pieces of the metal.

00:53:52.063 --> 00:53:55.974
TALIESIN: If we pulled the two shoulder pieces
off, could we maybe tie them together and wear

00:53:55.974 --> 00:53:58.184
them like an Eat at Joe's sign?

00:53:58.184 --> 00:54:00.473
MATT: Could certainly try that if you want to,
yes.

00:54:00.473 --> 00:54:01.869
TALIESIN: I'm going to give it a roll.

00:54:01.869 --> 00:54:08.474
MATT: Okay. I will say for this-- you know what,
go ahead and make a survival check

00:54:08.474 --> 00:54:09.906
on this to try and--

00:54:09.906 --> 00:54:14.941
TALIESIN: That's funny. No, I'm down. 12.

00:54:14.941 --> 00:54:21.105
MATT: 12. You manage to (grunt) for a minute, with
some help from a couple other of the goblins, pull

00:54:21.105 --> 00:54:24.085
one of the pauldrons off. You take it and--

00:54:24.085 --> 00:54:26.751
PHIL: Don't choke yourself!

00:54:26.751 --> 00:54:34.999
MATT: Based on your combat aesthetic, it's not
going to be much of a help to you.

00:54:34.999 --> 00:54:41.186
IVAN: This is-- I never thought I would hear a
goblin character say this, but I can spellcraft to

00:54:41.186 --> 00:54:43.154
check to see if it's magical at all?

00:54:43.154 --> 00:54:44.163
MATT: Sure. The armor?

00:54:44.163 --> 00:54:45.104
IVAN: The armor.

00:54:45.104 --> 00:54:46.289
MATT: Yeah. Go for it.

00:54:46.289 --> 00:54:54.135
IVAN: I almost want to kick it into the cistern to
get it dirty. I'm sorry. I don't know why I

00:54:54.135 --> 00:54:57.526
rolled because I'm doing spellcraft. Yes, that's
right. 19.

00:54:57.526 --> 00:55:02.912
MATT: The armor itself does not appear to have a
magical essence to it. In fact, a close look--

00:55:02.912 --> 00:55:08.383
it's pretty close to the design of armor the
guards were wearing on the actual bridge itself.

00:55:08.383 --> 00:55:13.842
It's just completely polished down here in the middle
of a dank sewer.

00:55:13.842 --> 00:55:16.836
ASHLY: Does the armor help any of the rest of us?
The goblin-crafted?

00:55:16.893 --> 00:55:20.501
TALIESIN: I'm going to throw it at Piglet. Just
throw it at you.

00:55:20.501 --> 00:55:22.230
MATT: It's delightful decoration.

00:55:22.230 --> 00:55:24.336
ASHLY: Oh! Ho ho ho ho!

00:55:24.336 --> 00:55:31.215
IVAN: Are you Woody Woodpecker now? I think
something killed--

00:55:31.215 --> 00:55:35.386
PHIL: I think something is down here cleaning.
We've got to get out of here!

00:55:35.386 --> 00:55:37.570
Before it comes back!

00:55:37.570 --> 00:55:41.381
IVAN: I don't want whatever cleaned this armor to
clean off Grizznak the Great's fine robes.

00:55:41.381 --> 00:55:43.708
PHIL: It'll take the farts right out of you.

00:55:43.708 --> 00:55:45.780
IVAN: Is there any way to climb up to the
grate?

00:55:45.780 --> 00:55:51.147
MATT: It's about 40 feet up from you guys. The
path continues across the cistern

00:55:51.147 --> 00:55:53.167
deeper into the city.

00:55:53.167 --> 00:55:55.667
MARISHA: We didn't think about having to crawl
back out.

00:55:55.667 --> 00:55:58.575
MATT: Beyond the cistern, the tunnel continues
after it converges.

00:55:58.575 --> 00:56:00.039
PHIL: Just keep going.

00:56:00.039 --> 00:56:03.932
MATT: Who's leading this expedition now?

00:56:03.932 --> 00:56:07.180
PHIL: I think I'm more qualified to lead but I
don't like to be in front.

00:56:07.180 --> 00:56:08.575
ASHLY: I have the prettiest hat.

00:56:08.575 --> 00:56:10.731
PHIL: Piglet. I nominate you.

00:56:10.731 --> 00:56:11.870
ASHLY: Hooray!

00:56:11.870 --> 00:56:14.277
MATT: Piglet, go ahead and roll perception.

00:56:14.277 --> 00:56:19.667
ASHLY: (singing) I forget where my perception is
every time. There it is. 19.

00:56:19.667 --> 00:56:31.112
MATT: 19, okay. All righty, so as you go-- as you
put your new shiny hat on and begin stepping

00:56:31.112 --> 00:56:37.793
forward across where the paths converge. You--
big, knees forward, stomping steps and you put

00:56:37.793 --> 00:56:45.698
your head forward and stop as there's a distortion
in the air before you. And you breathe out, "huh?"

00:56:45.698 --> 00:56:47.867
and it (wobbling noise) quivers.

00:56:47.867 --> 00:56:54.135
IVAN: Step aside, step aside! Grizznak the Great
is here.

00:56:54.135 --> 00:56:57.128
PHIL: Great. Let's get ready to be hit by
lightning.

00:56:57.128 --> 00:57:04.370
IVAN: Well. It looks like something wobbly, so
it's probably magic.

00:57:04.370 --> 00:57:07.055
MATT: You make a perception check.

00:57:07.055 --> 00:57:10.041
IVAN: I'm going to percept the shit out of this

00:57:10.041 --> 00:57:11.659
MARISHA: "Probably magic."

00:57:11.659 --> 00:57:13.537
IVAN: "Probably magic." 14.

00:57:13.537 --> 00:57:19.294
MATT: 14. You pull her aside. There's nothing
visible in the air before you. You're wondering

00:57:19.294 --> 00:57:27.512
why she stopped, and as you step forward, you hit
something. At which point you guys watch as you

00:57:27.512 --> 00:57:34.596
suddenly notice there is a large cube-like
creature made of some quivering gelatinous

00:57:34.596 --> 00:57:39.587
material. As Grizznak is slowly being
pulled into it.

00:57:39.587 --> 00:57:43.094
IVAN: No!

00:57:43.094 --> 00:57:45.692
MATT: Everyone roll initiative.

00:57:45.692 --> 00:57:47.412
IVAN: Guys guys guys!

00:57:47.412 --> 00:57:50.567
TALIESIN: That's how we do it. You did very well
in that. Add your initiative.

00:57:50.567 --> 00:57:55.042
MARISHA: Oh, you found a waterbed! Aw, how cool,
man!

00:57:55.042 --> 00:58:01.824
Oh! Gelatinous cube!

00:58:01.824 --> 00:58:05.118
IVAN: Can I get my hands together? At all? Or are
my hands--

00:58:05.118 --> 00:58:11.163
MATT: You can certainly try here. We'll see how
this works out for you. All right, so initiative

00:58:11.163 --> 00:58:18.896
rolls here. Oh man. All right, all right. So
initiative orders, we have 20 to 15.

00:58:18.896 --> 00:58:21.502
TALIESIN: 21.

00:58:21.502 --> 00:58:25.346
PHIL: 25.

00:58:25.346 --> 00:58:28.557
MARISHA: 15.

00:58:28.557 --> 00:58:30.621
ASHLY: I'm 19.

00:58:30.621 --> 00:58:32.430
IVAN: 12!

00:58:32.430 --> 00:58:34.720
MATT: What'd you get?

00:58:34.720 --> 00:58:35.935
MARISHA: 15.

00:58:35.935 --> 00:58:40.199
IVAN: Grizznak is the best.

00:58:40.199 --> 00:58:42.345
MATT: Grizznak, what did you roll?

00:58:42.345 --> 00:58:43.665
IVAN: 12.

00:58:43.665 --> 00:58:46.296
TALIESIN: That's how long. That's how long it
took. Are you happy now? Are you happy?

00:58:46.296 --> 00:58:52.637
ASHLY: (laughs) Oh! Oh no! I'm worried for
dick-butt.

00:58:52.637 --> 00:58:54.905
MARISHA: See! If you will it, it will happen.

00:58:54.905 --> 00:58:56.749
MATT: It will happen, every time.

00:58:56.749 --> 00:58:59.581
MARISHA: Haven't you heard of the story of the
little boy with the magical paintbrush?

00:58:59.581 --> 00:59:05.879
MATT: All right, so as you watch Grizznak
sucked into this giant creature, you see it

00:59:05.879 --> 00:59:11.933
shifting and (squelching sounds). Top of the round
is Browntooth. Browntooth, what do you want to do

00:59:11.933 --> 00:59:13.616
on your turn?

00:59:13.616 --> 00:59:16.436
PHIL: Suppose I have to attack it.

00:59:16.436 --> 00:59:19.704
IVAN: Pull me out! Pull me out!

00:59:19.704 --> 00:59:25.629
PHIL: Can I attack him or can I kill it? All
right, I hit it with my cleaver.

00:59:25.629 --> 00:59:29.614
MATT: All right, go ahead and roll for attack.

00:59:29.614 --> 00:59:34.437
PHIL: 16. Do I add anything?

00:59:34.437 --> 00:59:36.036
TALIESIN: Yeah, 16 plus--

00:59:36.036 --> 00:59:39.168
PHIL: Yes. 16 plus ten.

00:59:39.168 --> 00:59:41.413
MATT: That hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

00:59:41.413 --> 00:59:47.877
So you move up there. You can
move five feet and do your second attack if you

00:59:47.877 --> 00:59:49.983
want to. You're close enough that you can attack
with both.

00:59:49.983 --> 00:59:54.153
PHIL: Oh great. Two.

00:59:54.153 --> 00:59:55.655
TALIESIN: Plus one.

00:59:55.655 --> 00:59:59.758
PHIL: Plus one, three. And do I do another one?

00:59:59.758 --> 01:00:02.452
TALIESIN: No, and then you have to do it for the
other hand, which is different, so you have to

01:00:02.452 --> 01:00:03.757
roll again to hit for the second one.

01:00:03.757 --> 01:00:05.518
MATT: So what's the damage on the first one?

01:00:05.518 --> 01:00:06.500
PHIL: Three.

01:00:06.500 --> 01:00:08.133
MATT: Three damage. All right.

01:00:08.133 --> 01:00:10.335
TALIESIN: And then that's plus--

01:00:10.335 --> 01:00:13.306
PHIL: Five plus? Plus eight. 13.

01:00:13.306 --> 01:00:17.190
MATT: 13 does hit. It has a very low armor class
because it is a giant cube,

01:00:17.190 --> 01:00:20.800
so go ahead and roll damage.

01:00:20.800 --> 01:00:22.312
PHIL: Four.

01:00:22.312 --> 01:00:27.417
MATT: Nice. All right, so as you rush forward
taking your five-foot step and attack with your

01:00:27.616 --> 01:00:33.132
first goblin cleaver, you slice through part of
its form, then slice through with your second one.

01:00:33.132 --> 01:00:37.295
As you cut each time you can see it leaves a giant
opening and you cut a wedge out that

01:00:37.295 --> 01:00:43.689
(slurping noise) slops onto the ground and turns into a
slowly liquefying piece of water. The section that

01:00:43.689 --> 01:00:47.976
you cut out begins to slowly reform but, however,
it does lose the mass that you cut of it. So it

01:00:47.976 --> 01:00:53.673
appears to be having some sort of impact. That
finishes your turn, Browntooth. Mezek, you're up.

01:00:53.673 --> 01:00:56.221
TALIESIN: All right. I'm going to--

01:00:56.221 --> 01:01:04.827
MATT: However, actually real fast. 'Cause this is
part of the fun of it. Nope, actually, you're

01:01:04.827 --> 01:01:09.151
good. You're up, Mezek. Sorry, keeping track of
the rules for the creature. I haven't used

01:01:09.151 --> 01:01:10.672
gelatinous cube in so long.

01:01:10.672 --> 01:01:12.489
IVAN: I was waiting to hear, "And Grizznak, you
were eaten."

01:01:12.489 --> 01:01:13.710
(laughter)

01:01:13.710 --> 01:01:14.770
MATT: Technically, you were.

01:01:14.770 --> 01:01:17.409
TALIESIN: I'm going to take a deep breath.
(screams)

01:01:17.409 --> 01:01:20.617
ASHLY: Here he goes again.

01:01:20.617 --> 01:01:22.166
TALIESIN: And hit it with a stunning fist

01:01:22.166 --> 01:01:24.065
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and roll for the attack.

01:01:24.065 --> 01:01:27.312
MARISHA: He named it himself.

01:01:27.312 --> 01:01:29.420
PHIL: And your eyes are lovely.

01:01:29.420 --> 01:01:32.966
TALIESIN: One of them's mine. 16.

01:01:32.966 --> 01:01:35.304
MATT: 16 hits. Go ahead and roll damage for the
fist.

01:01:35.304 --> 01:01:37.549
IVAN: Don't stun the goblin inside, please.

01:01:37.549 --> 01:01:45.199
TALIESIN: Let's see. It's six points of damage.
And then they have to make a fortitude save.

01:01:45.199 --> 01:01:46.782
MATT: What is the save DC?

01:01:46.782 --> 01:01:47.755
TALIESIN: 14.

01:01:47.755 --> 01:01:58.695
MATT: 14. It rolls a 14 plus-- Plus nine, yeah.
This cube is unaffected by your tiny goblin--

01:01:58.695 --> 01:01:59.893
TALIESIN: It does go wobble, wobble, wobble.

01:01:59.893 --> 01:02:01.144
MATT: It does. Wob, wob, wob, wob.

01:02:01.144 --> 01:02:02.840
(laughter)

01:02:02.840 --> 01:02:04.566
IVAN: You can see me as I'm shifting.

01:02:04.566 --> 01:02:07.179
MARISHA: Cool.

01:02:07.179 --> 01:02:12.860
MATT: So I'd say you moved into there. You going to
stay where you are?

01:02:12.860 --> 01:02:18.578
TALIESIN: I'm going to take a step back and pull
out my quarterstaff. Now that I've had my turn.

01:02:18.578 --> 01:02:21.879
MATT: Okay, so you step back. It does get an
attack of opportunity as you move back. Its giant

01:02:21.879 --> 01:02:24.699
pseudopod shoots out towards you.

01:02:24.699 --> 01:02:26.992
IVAN: It wants to stunning fist you.

01:02:26.992 --> 01:02:31.657
MATT: That's a 12. What's your armor class?

01:02:31.657 --> 01:02:34.374
TALIESIN: Touch AC? Or armor class?

01:02:34.374 --> 01:02:35.990
MATT: No, this is a general one.

01:02:35.990 --> 01:02:36.990
TALIESIN: 18.

01:02:36.990 --> 01:02:40.945
MATT: 18? Yeah, as it (whoosh) out towards you,
you duck low with your quick goblin reflexes.

01:02:40.945 --> 01:02:44.768
Awesome, that ends your turn. Piglet, what do you
want to do?

01:02:44.768 --> 01:02:46.474
ASHLY: I want to rage!

01:02:46.474 --> 01:02:47.458
MATT: Okay.

01:02:47.458 --> 01:02:50.240
(laughter)

01:02:50.240 --> 01:02:56.315
MATT: You go into a full goblin Piglet rage.
Grabbing your oversized goblin skull-breaker

01:02:56.315 --> 01:02:59.241
hammer, go ahead and roll your attack.

01:02:59.241 --> 01:03:02.106
IVAN: I've always wanted to hear a goblin say
that.

01:03:02.106 --> 01:03:05.460
ASHLY: Oh okay, so it was 20. Plus seven.

01:03:05.460 --> 01:03:09.532
MATT: 20 plus seven. That hits. Go ahead and roll
damage.

01:03:09.532 --> 01:03:11.784
ASHLY: Where's a d10? Am I crazy?

01:03:11.784 --> 01:03:15.388
TALIESIN: Do you need a d10? Here.

01:03:15.388 --> 01:03:24.426
MATT: Also, Grizznak, I need you to roll a
constitution save. Sorry, a constitution base

01:03:24.426 --> 01:03:25.945
saving throw, fortitude save.

01:03:25.945 --> 01:03:34.153
ASHLY: So this is a d10 plus four. Oh, that's a
pretty one. Eight plus four. Times three? Is that

01:03:34.153 --> 01:03:35.351
what that is, or?

01:03:35.351 --> 01:03:38.426
MATT: Well, no. It should say, your second attack
down, is during raging.

01:03:38.426 --> 01:03:42.467
ASHLY: Oh, I'm sorry. Okay. Oh, okay. So it's
eight plus six then.

01:03:42.467 --> 01:03:47.060
MATT: All right, there you go. 14 points of damage
as your hammer comes down. Wham! Hitting it,

01:03:47.060 --> 01:03:52.218
stopping an inch from the edge of Grizznak's face
as he turns and watches from inside. The whole

01:03:52.218 --> 01:03:54.533
thing shakes from the impact.

01:03:54.533 --> 01:03:56.318
ASHLY: Do I also get to bite because I'm raging?

01:03:56.318 --> 01:03:57.325
MATT: You do.

01:03:57.325 --> 01:04:00.904
PHIL: Ew. Lucky you.

01:04:00.904 --> 01:04:06.144
IVAN: I have so many feelings right now. Some of
them are wobbling.

01:04:06.144 --> 01:04:07.321
ASHLY: 19.

01:04:07.321 --> 01:04:10.910
MATT: 19. That hits again. Go ahead and roll for
your bite damage. As you go in and bite a chunk

01:04:10.910 --> 01:04:13.872
out of this giant gelatinous mass like it's
dessert.

01:04:13.872 --> 01:04:15.408
ASHLY: d3?

01:04:15.408 --> 01:04:18.455
MATT: Yeah, so roll a d6 and divide by two.

01:04:18.455 --> 01:04:21.483
ASHLY: Okay. Boop. So it's a three.

01:04:21.483 --> 01:04:23.081
TALIESIN: That would be two.

01:04:23.081 --> 01:04:24.904
MATT: Yeah, so that would be two. Two plus?

01:04:24.904 --> 01:04:25.923
ASHLY: Plus three.

01:04:25.923 --> 01:04:32.096
MATT: Two plus three. So you do five points of
damage. Giant goblin maw bites into the side, once

01:04:32.096 --> 01:04:34.713
again near Grizznak's face.

01:04:34.713 --> 01:04:36.823
PHIL: She's raging. She doesn't know where she is.

01:04:36.823 --> 01:04:39.966
MATT: As you pull a bit away, immediately as you
pull back, the rage is in you, you don't really

01:04:39.966 --> 01:04:43.015
notice the fact that your mouth has gone tingling
and you've lost all sensation in your mouth.

01:04:43.015 --> 01:04:44.154
ASHLY: Oh no.

01:04:44.154 --> 01:04:47.120
MARISHA: Hey Piglet! How's the jello monster?

01:04:47.120 --> 01:04:48.343
ASHLY: Delicious.

01:04:48.343 --> 01:04:52.777
MATT: As you blah, drools out. As she talks, her
lips are numb. It's like blah, blah, blah.

01:04:52.777 --> 01:04:54.384
(laughter)

01:04:54.384 --> 01:04:59.785
MATT: It dribbles down the front of her body.
Yeah. Your tongue and mouth aren't moving like

01:04:59.785 --> 01:05:04.211
they should. You're a goblin that got out of the
dentist right now, because you took a bite out of it.

01:05:04.211 --> 01:05:06.181
MARISHA: The novocaine cube.

01:05:06.181 --> 01:05:09.738
ASHLY: Novocaine cube. That's awesome.

01:05:09.738 --> 01:05:12.892
MATT: Grizznak, did you roll your fortitude save?

01:05:12.892 --> 01:05:18.128
IVAN: My fortitude save? No, I haven't. Oh god.
Fortitude save. 11?

01:05:18.128 --> 01:05:20.047
MATT: 11. Okay.

01:05:20.047 --> 01:05:23.964
IVAN: Question mark?

01:05:23.964 --> 01:05:28.100
MATT: Okay, you are currently paralyzed for eight
rounds.

01:05:28.100 --> 01:05:29.740
MARISHA and ASHLY: What?!

01:05:29.740 --> 01:05:37.044
MATT: Being engulfed by this entity, it's actually
caused all of your muscles to lock up. And you

01:05:37.044 --> 01:05:41.056
feel that same tingling sensation as you glance
over and all the little hairs that might be

01:05:41.056 --> 01:05:44.445
protruding on your body dissolve. And part of your
skin begins to peel away.

01:05:44.445 --> 01:05:52.402
IVAN: I still have the last look that I had, which
is this stupid face of awe and wonder of Piglet

01:05:52.402 --> 01:05:55.929
raging. And that's all that's on my face right now
as I'm paralyzed inside of the cube.

01:05:55.929 --> 01:06:01.931
MATT: All right, so finishing Piglet's turn, that
comes to you, Snizzler. What are you going to do?

01:06:01.931 --> 01:06:06.880
MARISHA: Does he have any limbs or anything that
are sticking out still that are accessible?

01:06:06.880 --> 01:06:09.129
MATT: No. No. He is fully engulfed by the entity
right now.

01:06:09.129 --> 01:06:10.369
ASHLY: Oh shit.

01:06:10.369 --> 01:06:12.049
MARISHA: Where am I on the map?

01:06:12.049 --> 01:06:17.059
MATT: You are right there. By the way, this is the
opening. This drops down about 20 feet and the

01:06:17.059 --> 01:06:20.658
water is pouring into that, right behind you. So
be careful where you're stepping.

01:06:20.658 --> 01:06:29.492
MARISHA: Oh, that's good to know. Okay. Snizzler
runs up, takes out a pipe bomb. (clicking noise)

01:06:29.492 --> 01:06:33.814
Can I shove the pipe bomb in the jello?

01:06:33.814 --> 01:06:35.371
MATT: You can, if you want to.

01:06:35.371 --> 01:06:38.678
MARISHA: Is it going to start sucking me in when I
do that?

01:06:38.678 --> 01:06:40.063
TALIESIN: (shushes) Go with it. Go with it.

01:06:40.063 --> 01:06:42.649
MATT: You want to go with it? So you take a step
forward, you--

01:06:42.649 --> 01:06:47.678
MARISHA: I want to find the hole Piglet made and
aim for that.

01:06:47.678 --> 01:06:48.994
MATT: Okay, so you're going to step into there.

01:06:48.994 --> 01:06:52.980
MARISHA: And (grunts). Explosive bomb.

01:06:52.980 --> 01:06:59.924
MATT: So you watch as this haphazard piece of
metal shrapnel that's been matted together with

01:06:59.924 --> 01:07:08.743
pig feces and twine, goes (sticking noise). And is
now right in front of you as you see a little fuse

01:07:08.743 --> 01:07:10.228
going (sizzling).

01:07:10.228 --> 01:07:14.517
IVAN: I can't scream because I'm paralyzed, but
inside, I'm screaming. I'm screaming very loudly.

01:07:14.517 --> 01:07:17.104
MARISHA: And I look at Grizz and I go--

01:07:17.104 --> 01:07:18.916
MATT: Are you going to stay right there?

01:07:18.916 --> 01:07:24.268
MARISHA: And I take a few steps back. Not into the
hole.

01:07:24.268 --> 01:07:33.066
MATT: So it would probably be one, two, three.
We'll put you there. As you do that and pull back,

01:07:33.066 --> 01:07:37.221
another giant pseudopod goes (whoosh) out towards
you and slams into the stone next to you, but you

01:07:37.221 --> 01:07:39.928
go, huh. That's the least of your worries, right
now.

01:07:39.928 --> 01:07:41.502
MARISHA: Hang on one second, man.

01:07:41.502 --> 01:07:49.819
MATT: As you pull back, there's an explosion sound
as it bursts inside the cube. So I want you to go

01:07:49.819 --> 01:07:54.363
ahead and roll for an attack on this. Just for the
purposes of this.

01:07:54.363 --> 01:07:57.181
MARISHA: Sorry, Grizz. 18.

01:07:57.181 --> 01:08:02.572
MATT: 18, so yeah. This is a direct hit on the
creature. So go ahead and do your firebomb damage

01:08:02.572 --> 01:08:03.923
to the cube.

01:08:03.923 --> 01:08:05.236
IVAN: Oh, how much damage is it?

01:08:05.236 --> 01:08:07.667
MARISHA: Aw, it went into my soy sauce but I'm
going to take it because it was a six.

01:08:07.667 --> 01:08:09.519
(laughter)

01:08:09.519 --> 01:08:13.041
MARISHA: Ten plus three plus another d4--

01:08:13.041 --> 01:08:14.155
PHIL: That's what you call--

01:08:14.155 --> 01:08:16.584
PHIL and TALIESIN: --a salt with a deadly
weapon.

01:08:16.584 --> 01:08:21.773
MARISHA: So 15 points of damage.

01:08:21.773 --> 01:08:26.360
MATT: 15 points of fire damage as it bursts on the
inside. You are paralyzed, cannot make a reflex

01:08:26.360 --> 01:08:32.092
saving throw, you take six points of fire damage from
being in the blast radius of this thing.

01:08:32.092 --> 01:08:35.518
MARISHA: I was going to say, I do want to do an
explosive bomb, so direct hits catch fire, dealing

01:08:35.518 --> 01:08:38.021
an additional 1d6 fire damage every round.

01:08:38.021 --> 01:08:48.439
MATT: Oh. Good to know. So the actual cube is also
on fire. Due to the blast radius-- Because of the

01:08:48.439 --> 01:08:53.398
size of your explosion too, because it is the
ten-foot, I need both of you guys to roll reflex

01:08:53.398 --> 01:08:55.689
saving throws, if you could.

01:08:55.689 --> 01:08:58.412
ASHLY: I think it's a 20.

01:08:58.412 --> 01:09:01.119
MATT: Yep, d20, and add your reflex save.

01:09:01.119 --> 01:09:03.707
ASHLY: 17.

01:09:03.707 --> 01:09:04.746
PHIL: 16.

01:09:04.746 --> 01:09:08.981
MATT: 16. It's half damage, right, for that, so
both of you take three points of fire damage, as

01:09:08.981 --> 01:09:16.372
the blast radius of this sends chunks of this
creature sticking to the ceiling and slopping down.

01:09:16.372 --> 01:09:17.675
PHIL: I have evasion.

01:09:17.675 --> 01:09:19.468
MATT: You take none because you're a rogue.

01:09:19.468 --> 01:09:23.727
IVAN: Have I at least been blown out of the cube
or am I still inside of the cube?

01:09:23.727 --> 01:09:27.656
MATT: You're like partially out of it, right now,
with the blast radius. But--

01:09:27.656 --> 01:09:29.291
IVAN: So slightly exposed.

01:09:29.291 --> 01:09:32.577
MATT: You're slightly exposed. It's partially
exposed. And as you're there, going (muffled

01:09:32.577 --> 01:09:42.172
screaming), it (sucking noise, muffled screaming).
Closing around you slowly. All right, that

01:09:42.172 --> 01:09:48.253
finishes your turn. Now it is your turn. You take
two points of acid damage as it begins to slowly

01:09:48.253 --> 01:09:50.023
digest you from the inside.

01:09:50.023 --> 01:09:58.149
IVAN: So guys, I will probably not last another
couple of rounds. Just to be clear, so.

01:09:58.149 --> 01:09:59.900
TALIESIN: Working on it.

01:09:59.900 --> 01:10:06.375
IVAN: The skin is starting, but beyond just the
burning, oh god, the burning, there is-- you can

01:10:06.375 --> 01:10:12.807
see as most of Grizznak's robes have been
dissolved into nothingness, and part of his goblin

01:10:12.807 --> 01:10:22.087
face is starting to peel off, revealing my
immensely beautiful crooked teeth. So, yeah.

01:10:22.087 --> 01:10:27.607
TALIESIN: If my parents taught me anything, it's
that a burning sensation is nothing to worry

01:10:27.607 --> 01:10:29.580
about. You're good, you're good.

01:10:29.580 --> 01:10:32.011
MATT: All right, so as you two are there right in
front of it, the thing begins reforming the front

01:10:32.011 --> 01:10:35.949
of it, which is currently blown open from the bomb
that Snizzler left in there. It begins to shift

01:10:35.949 --> 01:10:40.564
and slither towards both of you guys and intending
to engulf you as well. I need you both to go ahead

01:10:40.564 --> 01:10:41.918
and make reflex saving throws.

01:10:41.918 --> 01:10:43.432
MARISHA: Oh man.

01:10:43.432 --> 01:10:51.016
ASHLY: No! I got seven. Do I get to know what the
result would be before I use my song?

01:10:51.016 --> 01:10:52.460
IVAN: You just get to reroll.

01:10:52.460 --> 01:10:54.980
MATT: You don't know what the result is, but do
you want to use your song now?

01:10:54.980 --> 01:10:57.709
MARISHA: Is that adding your reflex?

01:10:57.709 --> 01:11:00.763
ASHLY: I had a seven. Yeah, adding my reflex.

01:11:00.763 --> 01:11:01.998
MARISHA: Adding your reflex.

01:11:01.998 --> 01:11:04.392
MATT: What'd you get? Browntooth?

01:11:04.392 --> 01:11:10.724
PHIL: I got a 19 plus nine. 28.

01:11:10.724 --> 01:11:13.620
MATT: Okay, you dart out of the way into the
groove here as it moves forward.

01:11:13.620 --> 01:11:15.705
PHIL: Which is what I was planning to do anyway.

01:11:15.705 --> 01:11:20.664
MATT: So as you duck, as it begins to shift
forward, Piglet, in a moment of intensity, staring

01:11:20.664 --> 01:11:30.533
into the face of this for the first time, probably
your entire life, you're like, I can die. What?

01:11:30.533 --> 01:11:31.702
What are you going to do?

01:11:31.702 --> 01:11:34.664
ASHLY: I decide, no, I'm going to live forever,
and I'll sing my song.

01:11:34.664 --> 01:11:36.032
MATT: All right, go for it. What's your song?

01:11:36.032 --> 01:11:39.942
ASHLY: Okay. I'm going to try a thing. I don't
know if it's going to work.

01:11:39.942 --> 01:11:41.114
MATT: All right.

01:11:41.114 --> 01:11:46.740
ASHLY: I'm going to try to sing my song to the
tune of Kiss from a Rose. Because that's my go-to.

01:11:46.740 --> 01:11:50.594
TALIESIN: You're my favorite. Oh god.

01:11:50.594 --> 01:12:08.976
ASHLY: Let's see. (sings) Piglet, twitchy scratch
the rash until she sees them loud. Love trash,

01:12:08.976 --> 01:12:16.035
lift the hammer down and crash. Piglet angry time
to smash. Sorry.

01:12:16.035 --> 01:12:20.790
MATT: Well done. So go ahead and reroll your
reflex.

01:12:20.790 --> 01:12:23.044
IVAN: Please post those lyrics at some point.

01:12:23.044 --> 01:12:24.533
ASHLY: I got a two again.

01:12:24.533 --> 01:12:25.898
TALIESIN: No!

01:12:25.898 --> 01:12:28.334
ASHLY: I am going to die.

01:12:28.334 --> 01:12:31.715
PHIL: I mean, it wasn't a very good song.

01:12:31.715 --> 01:12:34.525
MARISHA: Fuck you, Seal. Fuck you.

01:12:34.525 --> 01:12:37.444
ASHLY: No! Shit.

01:12:37.444 --> 01:12:42.615
MATT: The creature has now engulfed both Piglet
and you get pulled up right next to it, jammed

01:12:42.615 --> 01:12:49.220
into the currently paralyzed Grizznak. I need you
to go ahead and make a fortitude saving throw.

01:12:49.220 --> 01:12:52.687
ASHLY: Oh my. Okay. It's the 20?

01:12:52.687 --> 01:12:59.113
TALIESIN: Here. Go nuts. That's the serious
business die.

01:12:59.113 --> 01:13:00.863
ASHLY: 14.

01:13:00.863 --> 01:13:02.469
TALIESIN: There we go.

01:13:02.469 --> 01:13:03.716
ASHLY: 19.

01:13:03.716 --> 01:13:05.161
This is beautiful.

01:13:05.161 --> 01:13:06.837
TALIESIN: Thank you. That's the angry die.

01:13:06.837 --> 01:13:08.349
ASHLY: That's the goddammit die.

01:13:08.349 --> 01:13:10.931
PHIL: Goddammit, don't die.

01:13:10.931 --> 01:13:16.633
MATT: And as you're pulled into it, trying to find
your way through, you get pulled into the thing,

01:13:16.633 --> 01:13:22.423
and you feel like that same numb sensation all
across. Which, by the way, your goblin song maybe

01:13:22.423 --> 01:13:26.030
missed a few vowels because of the blahlah, but
the rest of your body begins to tingle and you

01:13:26.030 --> 01:13:28.617
begin to fight against it and your body won't
move.

01:13:28.617 --> 01:13:29.859
MARISHA: No!

01:13:29.859 --> 01:13:31.385
MATT: Your body's paralyzed for six rounds.

01:13:31.385 --> 01:13:32.969
PHIL: Only six.

01:13:32.969 --> 01:13:39.262
MATT: Jammed up against-- However, it does take
another d6 points of fire damage from your bomb. So

01:13:39.262 --> 01:13:43.084
go ahead and roll that if you could.

01:13:43.084 --> 01:13:44.402
MARISHA: Four.

01:13:44.402 --> 01:13:49.766
MATT: Four points of fire damage. All righty. All
right, that brings us back to the top, Browntooth,

01:13:49.766 --> 01:13:52.257
you're up. You dodge to the side. You see it
engulf--

01:13:52.257 --> 01:13:55.903
PHIL: Is it moving away from me?

01:13:55.903 --> 01:13:59.929
MATT: It is. It moved this way and you sidestep
and it's moving parallel to you.

01:13:59.929 --> 01:14:04.295
PHIL: Okay. I would like to get behind it and
shoot my crossbow.

01:14:04.295 --> 01:14:07.039
MATT: Okay. So you move--

01:14:07.039 --> 01:14:12.419
PHIL: Because I've decided I don't want any more
hand-to-hand combat. Seems like a bad idea.

01:14:12.419 --> 01:14:15.530
MATT: A pseudopod swings out towards you but you--
it misses you entirely. As you dart backward with

01:14:15.530 --> 01:14:18.729
your crossbow loaded, you take aim and go ahead
and fire.

01:14:18.729 --> 01:14:29.647
PHIL: This one, right? Fuck. Seven plus nine. 16.

01:14:29.647 --> 01:14:35.419
MATT: You've heard the term "couldn't hit the
broad side of a barn"? Thankfully, this creature

01:14:35.419 --> 01:14:42.363
is the size of a barn. You manage to sink the bolt
into it. Go ahead and roll damage. You feel a

01:14:42.363 --> 01:14:48.011
slight bit of pain at your back as a bolt nips you
in the butt. But you can't do anything about it

01:14:48.011 --> 01:14:58.245
because you're paralyzed. Five points of damage.
All right. You guys can see the creature's shaking

01:14:58.245 --> 01:15:01.695
and shimmering as it's moving forward. It's having
a hard time keeping its form together, it's

01:15:01.695 --> 01:15:05.274
looking really rough as it's slowly dissolving
your two friends.

01:15:05.274 --> 01:15:08.316
MARISHA: Burn! Fire!

01:15:08.316 --> 01:15:11.102
MATT: All right, that's going to go ahead and
bring us to Mezek.

01:15:11.102 --> 01:15:15.002
TALIESIN: I am going to charge it with my
quarterstaff and hit it with a flurry of blows. I

01:15:15.002 --> 01:15:16.654
don't have any Ki points right now, do I?

01:15:16.654 --> 01:15:24.961
MATT: No because you are sober-- You require a
full round action to do flurry of bros. (laughs)

01:15:24.961 --> 01:15:26.502
MARISHA: Fury of bros? (laughs)

01:15:26.502 --> 01:15:28.722
PHIL : Fury of bros, (screams) yeah dude!

01:15:28.722 --> 01:15:30.525
TALIESIN: Okay, so I can't make a movement.

01:15:30.525 --> 01:15:35.803
MATT: You are two squares away from it, so in
order to get into it you would have to do a full

01:15:35.803 --> 01:15:37.929
round action.

01:15:37.929 --> 01:15:49.269
TALIESIN: Okay, I'll take the-- I'll take a nice
big, flying swing with my stick.

01:15:49.269 --> 01:15:51.875
MATT: Go for it.

01:15:51.875 --> 01:15:55.568
TALIESIN: (goblin screech) That's 13.

01:15:55.568 --> 01:15:57.585
MATT: 13 hits, go ahead and roll damage.

01:15:57.585 --> 01:16:03.597
TALIESIN: God damn. That's seven. Seven points of
damage.

01:16:03.597 --> 01:16:05.829
MATT: Seven points of damage--

01:16:05.829 --> 01:16:08.678
How do you want to do this?

01:16:08.678 --> 01:16:14.356
TALIESIN: I want to, screaming bloody murder,
squish it and splash it with the stick like you

01:16:14.356 --> 01:16:18.438
were trying to hit a rat scurrying around on the
ground, and I don't care, once it's gone, I'm

01:16:18.438 --> 01:16:23.807
going to keep hitting them. I'm going to keep
slapping and slapping until it's mush.

01:16:23.807 --> 01:16:29.815
MATT: Okay. You guys watch as Mezek goes batshit
insane on this cube, smacks into the side, manages

01:16:29.815 --> 01:16:33.480
to hit a core of its form where some of the bones
are floating inside from previous victims.

01:16:33.480 --> 01:16:37.514
Probably the shiny things you saw earlier, the
person that once wore it, bits of them are

01:16:37.514 --> 01:16:43.852
floating inside. As it begins to collapse on
itself like an order of cold flan and as it

01:16:43.852 --> 01:16:48.309
liquefies, part of it pouring into the cistern,
the two of their bodies are starting to be pulled

01:16:48.309 --> 01:16:51.311
into the cistern with its form, unable to keep
shape.

01:16:51.311 --> 01:16:52.567
ASHLY: Help! Help! Help!

01:16:52.567 --> 01:16:53.857
TALIESIN: I run in and grab them!

01:16:53.857 --> 01:16:57.365
MARISHA: Yeah, I help as well. Oh, Grizz!

01:16:57.365 --> 01:17:01.853
MATT: Okay. You guys grab them, pull them out onto
the side. The last bit of the flaming corpse of

01:17:01.853 --> 01:17:08.598
this cube sloshes into the cistern. You wait about
another minute or so before you both get your

01:17:08.598 --> 01:17:09.956
bodies back.

01:17:09.956 --> 01:17:15.463
MARISHA: I take a little goo out of his ear and
I-- Ah, yeah, it's got a little kick there, yeah,

01:17:15.463 --> 01:17:16.770
you're right.

01:17:16.770 --> 01:17:22.899
IVAN: I take my nose and go-- and I watch as goo
goes (wet noise) out of my ears.

01:17:22.899 --> 01:17:27.365
ASHLY: Is this what being greased feels like?
Because I don't like it.

01:17:27.365 --> 01:17:28.603
TALIESIN: It's not easy--

01:17:28.603 --> 01:17:30.323
ASHLY, PHIL and TALIESIN: Being greased.

01:17:30.323 --> 01:17:39.713
MATT: So as you're resting up from this, do you
guys need to do anything to heal up a bit?

01:17:39.713 --> 01:17:43.724
IVAN: If we had things in which to heal up with,
but as of course--

01:17:43.724 --> 01:17:46.254
MARISHA: Do we get any healing surges or anything
like that?

01:17:46.254 --> 01:17:49.085
MATT: No. This is Pathfinder, girl.

01:17:49.085 --> 01:17:53.657
IVAN: This is not like fourth edition. I don't
think we have anything because I certainly didn't

01:17:53.657 --> 01:17:55.280
take it and we have no real--

01:17:55.280 --> 01:17:59.691
TALIESIN: I have the healing skill, can we try and
use the healing skill to reset things?

01:17:59.691 --> 01:18:06.965
MATT: Sure I'll let you do that, being the monk
that you are.

01:18:06.965 --> 01:18:15.606
PHIL: When they say it couldn't hurt, I'm not sure
they're right.

01:18:15.606 --> 01:18:17.831
TALIESIN: 20!

01:18:17.831 --> 01:18:23.575
MATT: 20? And with that, with the various burn
wounds on your body, from the acid that's burned

01:18:23.575 --> 01:18:28.982
away and parts of the actual burn damage you've
taken from the explosion, Mezek rushes in and like

01:18:28.982 --> 01:18:31.102
the roughest masseuse you've ever seen--

01:18:31.102 --> 01:18:33.106
IVAN: It's like the best shiatsu massage I've ever
gotten.

01:18:33.106 --> 01:18:40.164
TALIESIN: Let go! Let go! You're holding a lot of
tension!

01:18:40.164 --> 01:18:45.371
IVAN: Ugh, that's good, that one right there. That
knot especially.

01:18:45.371 --> 01:18:47.635
PHIL: Don't forget to breathe.

01:18:47.635 --> 01:18:54.806
MATT: I'd say for that, go ahead and heal four
points due to the rhythmic massage of Mezek's

01:18:54.806 --> 01:18:56.852
rough and tumble goblin hands.

01:18:56.852 --> 01:19:05.960
IVAN: I would like to point out that you just healed me
through a goblin shiatsu massage,

01:19:05.960 --> 01:19:07.233
that was amazing.

01:19:07.233 --> 01:19:08.868
MATT: Yes, yep that happened.

01:19:08.868 --> 01:19:12.842
TALIESIN: With vomit-based massage oil! It's
organic!

01:19:12.842 --> 01:19:14.366
ASHLY: Only the finest for you.

01:19:14.366 --> 01:19:20.651
IVAN: I step up and I crack my back a little bit
and okay. We're good to go. Let's do this.

01:19:20.651 --> 01:19:25.786
TALIESIN: Do any of my flasks or jugs have any
liquor in them?

01:19:25.786 --> 01:19:28.295
MATT: No. However, make a perception check.

01:19:28.295 --> 01:19:33.137
ASHLY: I also have a jug, I don't know what's in
it.

01:19:33.137 --> 01:19:34.183
TALIESIN: 20.

01:19:34.183 --> 01:19:41.222
MATT: 20. You have a jug, it's mainly sloshing
water and grime, your usual-- what you like to sip

01:19:41.222 --> 01:19:44.927
on the way of your journey. Whatever you find
along the way. You guys are into this whole

01:19:44.927 --> 01:19:48.270
scavenging thing. As you're thinking about this,
ah, you didn't bring any alcohol,

01:19:48.270 --> 01:19:50.864
you smell alcohol.

01:19:50.864 --> 01:19:55.237
TALIESIN: (sniffs) Happy juice. Happy juice!

01:19:55.237 --> 01:20:00.660
MATT: All of a sudden you guys watch as Mezek
darts down the path--

01:20:00.660 --> 01:20:06.496
IVAN: Follow him! He found booze, which means when
there's booze there's stuff and a happy Mezek.

01:20:06.496 --> 01:20:08.092
MARISHA: Yeah, I like that.

01:20:08.092 --> 01:20:13.649
MATT: As you dart ahead, you come to the edge, and
you can see there the path continues for another

01:20:13.649 --> 01:20:18.083
200 feet before it dips off, but you don't know
quite where. But the scent is strong here and you

01:20:18.083 --> 01:20:24.058
look over and you can see the wall to your
immediate right actually has a fissure in it. A

01:20:24.058 --> 01:20:28.437
part of it has cracked or a part of it has
semi-eroded away. And you can see the very distant

01:20:28.437 --> 01:20:30.510
dark glimmer of something beyond it.

01:20:30.510 --> 01:20:33.227
TALIESIN: I stick my hand in and go for it.

01:20:33.227 --> 01:20:34.954
MATT: Go ahead and make a strength check.

01:20:34.954 --> 01:20:39.618
TALIESIN: That's not funny. Eight.

01:20:39.618 --> 01:20:44.859
MATT: Eight. You go and grab the stone, you
lift your whole goblin body up on it and start pulling. You

01:20:44.954 --> 01:20:48.398
guys catch up and see Mezek fighting with this
wall and making no headway whatsoever.

01:20:48.398 --> 01:20:50.211
TALIESIN: Piglet! Piglet!

01:20:50.211 --> 01:20:52.410
ASHLY: Okay, let me smash this with the hammer.

01:20:52.410 --> 01:20:57.155
IVAN: I was going to say, I'm going to grab
Mezek's waist and help him pull, so that we're just

01:20:57.155 --> 01:20:59.471
two goblins pulling on it now.

01:20:59.471 --> 01:21:02.403
MATT: (laughs) Okay, so you guys are just like
double-pulling on it. You make a strength check

01:21:02.403 --> 01:21:04.145
as well. Go ahead and roll an attack against the
wall.

01:21:04.145 --> 01:21:06.105
MARISHA: Is Mezek getting in a fight with a
wall again?

01:21:06.105 --> 01:21:07.955
IVAN: He does this, just humor him.

01:21:07.993 --> 01:21:09.361
PHIL: He usually loses.

01:21:09.361 --> 01:21:12.558
ASHLY: 17? Is this plus strength?

01:21:12.558 --> 01:21:14.034
TALIESIN: Plus strength modifier.

01:21:14.034 --> 01:21:19.574
MATT: Well, go ahead and roll damage because you
hit the wall. Outside of a critical fail,

01:21:19.574 --> 01:21:21.222
you're fine.

01:21:21.222 --> 01:21:23.383
ASHLY: So should I do my normal?

01:21:23.383 --> 01:21:28.173
MATT: Yes, a normal d10 plus-- you're not raging,
so that would be a plus four.

01:21:28.173 --> 01:21:29.669
ASHLY: Five.

01:21:29.669 --> 01:21:37.172
MATT: Five points of damage. As you guys are
pulling, the hammer comes down as Piglet smashes

01:21:37.172 --> 01:21:42.920
into the side of this wall. The stones crumble inward and
you both go flung forward into the darkness,

01:21:42.920 --> 01:21:48.836
tumbling over each other before you both (impact
noise) against the wall, slowly slide down. As you

01:21:48.836 --> 01:21:57.242
look around, you're inside this darkened chamber.
Glancing around you, first off you immediately

01:21:57.242 --> 01:21:59.537
notice that there is a heavy smell of alcohol in
this room.

01:21:59.537 --> 01:22:05.732
IVAN: We're in one of those, humans call them a
"Ta-vern" or one--

01:22:05.732 --> 01:22:10.944
MARISHA: This is one of those cel-lar. Cel-lar?

01:22:10.944 --> 01:22:16.678
IVAN: It's, yeah, it's where they do their
fighting at. It's basically where humans go to

01:22:16.678 --> 01:22:18.519
beat up each other. It's a goblin pit!

01:22:18.519 --> 01:22:19.985
TALIESIN: Sounds like heaven.

01:22:19.985 --> 01:22:21.184
IVAN: It's amazing.

01:22:21.184 --> 01:22:24.017
ASHLY: I've heard they also "pick up chicks".
Whatever that means.

01:22:24.017 --> 01:22:25.616
TALIESIN: Baby chickens?

01:22:25.616 --> 01:22:31.583
ASHLY: (loudly) There are chickens here?! It's
like a "hoo-er house", right?

01:22:31.583 --> 01:22:36.771
PHIL: Do they eat owls, too? Chickens and owls?
I'm getting hungry!

01:22:36.771 --> 01:22:38.184
TALIESIN: Baby owls!

01:22:38.184 --> 01:22:41.682
MATT: Which, as you guys are getting hungry, you
look around this chamber you're in, you see a sack

01:22:41.682 --> 01:22:52.562
of moldy grains, small containers of salts and
spices, dried meats that are put on racks against the wall,

01:22:52.562 --> 01:22:57.577
casks and bottles of wine, and ale all throughout
this--

01:22:57.577 --> 01:22:59.407
TALIESIN: Done. Ale? Done. Going for the ale.

01:22:59.407 --> 01:23:04.080
IVAN: We forgot about our mission for as long as
it takes for us to eat everything in this cellar.

01:23:04.080 --> 01:23:09.653
MATT: You guys go nuts! Devouring everything,
grabbing at meat, filling your bellies. You'd

01:23:09.653 --> 01:23:11.868
be welcome to fill your jugs with alcohol--

01:23:11.868 --> 01:23:13.701
TALIESIN: I'm filling my flask and my waterskin.

01:23:13.701 --> 01:23:16.948
MATT: Do you clear out your
jug first, or are you just going to add to it?

01:23:17.338 --> 01:23:19.489
TALIESIN: No, I'm just going to add it.

01:23:19.489 --> 01:23:21.000
MATT: All right, cool.

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.553
IVAN: Does this help me at all with my current hit
point situation?

01:23:23.553 --> 01:23:25.324
MARISHA: Eat up, maybe?

01:23:25.324 --> 01:23:32.621
MATT: For the circumstances here, you heal
one hit point from the food--

01:23:32.621 --> 01:23:36.387
TALIESIN: We all heal one?

01:23:36.387 --> 01:23:45.875
IVAN: But yeah, I will eat it all, if anything it
will allow me to feel better.

01:23:45.875 --> 01:23:48.955
MATT: I will say, if you want to go ahead and tear
into that moldy grain, that might heal you a

01:23:48.955 --> 01:23:52.891
little more, but it looks like your stomach might
have a rough time with it.

01:23:52.891 --> 01:23:54.122
Do you want to go for it?

01:23:54.122 --> 01:23:56.630
TALIESIN: Maybe you have to have a chat with a
spirit animal.

01:23:56.630 --> 01:23:57.907
IVAN: I'm a god damn goblin.

01:23:57.907 --> 01:23:59.293
TALIESIN: Nothing bad happens when you eat moldy
grain.

01:23:59.293 --> 01:24:01.010
MATT: You get on top of that moldy grain, you tear
into it, you destroy it--

01:24:01.010 --> 01:24:07.500
IVAN: I'm going to-- at one point I'm going to take
one of the pots and I'm going to scoop it, and I'm

01:24:07.500 --> 01:24:13.956
going to pour it over my head because I know that
moldy grain has healing properties. And as I put

01:24:13.956 --> 01:24:17.982
it into my mouth I'm going to rub it all over my
burning sores.

01:24:17.982 --> 01:24:21.389
PHIL: I call you Grizznak the Glutinous.

01:24:21.389 --> 01:24:22.842
(laughter)

01:24:22.842 --> 01:24:25.597
TALIESIN: I'm imagining Orson Welles at the end of
Apocalypse Now! right now, with the towel--

01:24:25.597 --> 01:24:33.655
IVAN: Also Arcane Mark on the cellar wall, Goblin
Dickbutt, Grizznak the Great has been here.

01:24:33.655 --> 01:24:39.907
MATT: As you go ahead and focus over on the wall,
you hear this rumbling in your stomach. Go ahead

01:24:39.907 --> 01:24:41.575
and roll a fortitude saving throw.

01:24:41.575 --> 01:24:44.074
IVAN: Yeah, I'm really good at fortitude saves,
why can't I do will saves, ever? Fortitude

01:24:44.074 --> 01:24:46.163
saves... shit.

01:24:46.163 --> 01:24:47.850
PHIL: (cackles) Literally.

01:24:47.850 --> 01:24:49.034
IVAN: Eight.

01:24:49.034 --> 01:24:56.232
MATT: Well, the good news is you heal three
additional hit points as your goblin metabolism

01:24:56.232 --> 01:25:06.501
takes in the horrible, moldy grain. The downside
is, you then vomit up all the moldy grain, and you

01:25:06.501 --> 01:25:08.130
lose the hit points.

01:25:08.130 --> 01:25:11.220
ASHLY: I'm going to get rid of the wine and put
that all in my jug.

01:25:11.220 --> 01:25:12.251
MATT: Okay.

01:25:12.251 --> 01:25:14.132
IVAN: I feel great until I vomit it back up
again.

01:25:14.132 --> 01:25:16.705
ASHLY: I had all the wine in my jug, and I got rid
of it and filled it with vomit.

01:25:16.705 --> 01:25:25.226
PHIL: I'd like to secretly pocket some of the
dried meats. To take with me.

01:25:25.226 --> 01:25:27.645
MATT: Secretly, so nobody else sees it, or--

01:25:27.645 --> 01:25:29.062
PHIL: No, they don't see it.

01:25:29.062 --> 01:25:30.701
MATT: Make a sleight-of-hand check.

01:25:30.701 --> 01:25:33.349
TALIESIN: I like a man with secrets. Oh my--

01:25:33.349 --> 01:25:37.229
ASHLY: He just shoved an entire cow down his
pants.

01:25:37.229 --> 01:25:38.508
PHIL: 32.

01:25:38.508 --> 01:25:40.032
TALIESIN: He rolled a-- tell him what you rolled.

01:25:40.032 --> 01:25:42.338
PHIL: I rolled a natural 20 with a plus 12
sleight-of-hand.

01:25:42.338 --> 01:25:46.034
MATT: (laughs) As everyone else is marveling
themselves at this display of goblin gluttony, you

01:25:46.034 --> 01:25:51.941
step backwards and somehow in the process of
giving your fellow goblins a little bit of a head

01:25:51.941 --> 01:25:56.417
nod, you have managed to fill all of your pouches
and pockets with every single piece of meat on

01:25:56.417 --> 01:26:04.246
that wall. It goes from full to empty in a second,
and no one's the wiser. You got like saddle bags

01:26:04.246 --> 01:26:07.069
filled with food right now and no one seems to
have noticed.

01:26:07.069 --> 01:26:09.691
IVAN: Browntooth! You're looking very fit.

01:26:09.691 --> 01:26:11.701
PHIL: Well, I work out.

01:26:11.701 --> 01:26:13.112
MARISHA: You're very curvy.

01:26:13.112 --> 01:26:14.349
IVAN: So curvy.

01:26:14.349 --> 01:26:16.795
MARISHA: And you've got a little junk in the
trunk, looks good.

01:26:16.795 --> 01:26:19.456
PHIL: Yeah, y'know. Comes from my mother's side.

01:26:19.456 --> 01:26:22.396
MARISHA: Ah, sure, yeah. Your mom, man.

01:26:22.396 --> 01:26:25.159
MATT: As you guys are finishing this mountain of
goblin gluttony, we're going to go ahead and take

01:26:25.159 --> 01:26:27.438
a quick break here, we'll be back here in a few
minutes.

01:26:27.438 --> 01:26:34.537
MARISHA: Don't let me forget, I want to try and
find some wine bottles for molotov cocktails,

01:26:34.537 --> 01:26:35.993
don't let me forget.

01:26:35.993 --> 01:26:38.544
MATT: All right. We'll be right back.

01:26:38.544 --> 01:38:53.168
[break]

01:38:53.168 --> 01:38:59.728
MATT: Welcome back. So. We've had a little break
here, we're coming back into the chaos here. So,

01:38:59.728 --> 01:39:06.448
this goblin band, having taken root in this
storage basement beneath this human barn, the

01:39:06.448 --> 01:39:09.131
center of the town of Sandpoint, you've--

01:39:09.131 --> 01:39:13.336
MARISHA: Oh, wait, I want to make sure I find some
wine bottles, maybe I can make some molotov

01:39:13.336 --> 01:39:15.641
cocktails real quick. Maybe.

01:39:15.641 --> 01:39:20.808
MATT: Okay. You gather a couple of bottles of
wine. You, not really being able to read the

01:39:20.808 --> 01:39:24.191
labels, gather what seems to be alcoholic and
functional.

01:39:24.191 --> 01:39:25.655
MARISHA: Looks expensive.

01:39:25.655 --> 01:39:26.830
TALIESIN: Looks like molotov.

01:39:26.830 --> 01:39:27.796
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:39:27.796 --> 01:39:35.391
MATT: All right. While this is happening, does
anyone want to do anything else here?

01:39:35.391 --> 01:39:42.340
IVAN: I want to roll in the discarded grain that I
then threw up to give me temporary hit points, and

01:39:42.340 --> 01:39:44.519
I want to roll in it.

01:39:44.519 --> 01:39:49.453
MATT: Okay. You roll around in it and you feel
like it'll give you sufficient protection against

01:39:49.453 --> 01:39:51.260
a light wind.

01:39:51.260 --> 01:39:54.181
MARISHA: Like a dog rolling in his vomit.

01:39:54.181 --> 01:39:57.340
IVAN: Yes, exactly. That's exactly how it's going
down.

01:39:57.340 --> 01:40:01.692
MATT: You can hear the footsteps and what sounds
like voices from upstairs. There is a ladder in

01:40:01.692 --> 01:40:05.747
the far edge of this room that leads up to a trap
door, and when the trap door is closed, you can

01:40:05.747 --> 01:40:10.754
hear what sounds like the occasional chuckle,
voices that are muffled through the wood. It

01:40:10.754 --> 01:40:16.923
appears that there is an actual tavern above you
on street level that has a handful of patrons in it.

01:40:16.923 --> 01:40:23.452
IVAN: So, do we escape through the tavern or do we
go back into the caves and see if we can get under

01:40:23.452 --> 01:40:26.933
the godly poopoo place?

01:40:26.933 --> 01:40:31.487
ASHLY: Can I roll a perception to see if there's
any other way out apart from the place with all

01:40:31.487 --> 01:40:33.439
the humans and the place we just came from?

01:40:33.439 --> 01:40:34.855
MATT: Sure.

01:40:34.855 --> 01:40:40.147
ASHLY: That's not great. It's a ten.

01:40:40.147 --> 01:40:46.034
MATT: Ten. I mean, there's the path. You can keep
going or there's the tavern.

01:40:46.034 --> 01:40:50.345
ASHLY: Oh right, we can keep going.

01:40:50.345 --> 01:40:53.293
IVAN: We can keep going to find the birch tree.

01:40:53.293 --> 01:40:54.758
PHIL: Church.

01:40:54.758 --> 01:40:56.842
IVAN: Which is where the-- Church, right, the
birch.

01:40:56.842 --> 01:41:00.786
MATT: Which as a note, you guys currently have no
idea where in this city you are. You're just in

01:41:00.786 --> 01:41:02.445
the sewers.

01:41:02.445 --> 01:41:10.362
IVAN: This is fine. This is part of the plan.
Don't even worry about it. Or we could just run

01:41:10.362 --> 01:41:12.387
out into the streets. Goblins.

01:41:12.387 --> 01:41:24.609
PHIL: That sounds decidedly unstealthy. I say we
keep going down until we find poop that seems like

01:41:24.609 --> 01:41:26.294
it's from a blue man.

01:41:26.294 --> 01:41:29.440
MARISHA: I like that. Yeah. For the blue poop.

01:41:29.440 --> 01:41:31.495
IVAN: Browntooth, let's go find the blue poop.

01:41:31.495 --> 01:41:34.968
MARISHA: Let's find the blue poop. Onward.

01:41:34.968 --> 01:41:37.839
IVAN: So we're going to crawl back out through the hole
that we made.

01:41:37.839 --> 01:41:41.377
MARISHA: Maybe there's more cellars like this
too.

01:41:41.377 --> 01:41:42.989
MATT: Okay.

01:41:42.989 --> 01:41:44.696
PHIL: More food.

01:41:44.696 --> 01:41:49.096
MATT: You guys climb outside of the
section of the broken wall and continue down the path.

01:41:49.096 --> 01:41:54.606
IVAN: As we leave, I would like to leave a parting
Flare into the cellar, because burning.

01:41:54.606 --> 01:41:56.210
MATT: (chuckles) Okay.

01:41:56.210 --> 01:42:03.192
IVAN: Because burning. As I leave, I'm like-- on
my way out.

01:42:03.192 --> 01:42:11.028
MATT: Okay. You see the flare begin to slowly
cause an ember to burn at the edge of a burlap

01:42:11.028 --> 01:42:14.448
sack of some spices in the corner.

01:42:14.448 --> 01:42:15.741
MARISHA: Good one.

01:42:15.741 --> 01:42:18.073
IVAN: Yeah! Woo.

01:42:18.073 --> 01:42:22.597
MATT: All right. You guys continue to walk down
this pathway in the sewage system for about

01:42:22.597 --> 01:42:30.483
another 100 or so, 150 feet. It slowly pinches
into about a five-foot-wide tunnel. You guys can

01:42:30.483 --> 01:42:35.698
stand shoulder-to-shoulder, two at a time at your
goblin size to get across. And the little bit of

01:42:35.698 --> 01:42:43.183
water that is coming through here from the rain
runoff from some of the upper grate areas that are

01:42:43.183 --> 01:42:49.120
pouring in, it seems to be running to the edge.
And you stumble a ways ahead before you find out

01:42:49.120 --> 01:42:53.863
that there, that drop-off that you noticed, you
come up to it and it is indeed a drop-off. You

01:42:53.863 --> 01:43:02.171
glance down and the walkway you're at ends
abruptly around a large cylindrical cistern-type

01:43:02.171 --> 01:43:10.737
chamber. Probably a good 80 feet across and about
80 feet down, further than your vision can really

01:43:10.737 --> 01:43:13.743
see. You don't see a bottom of it. You see (water
falling).

01:43:13.743 --> 01:43:15.379
IVAN: What does the loogie tell me?

01:43:15.379 --> 01:43:18.743
MATT: You spit out the loogie. Make a perception
check.

01:43:18.743 --> 01:43:21.358
IVAN: Loogie perception check.

01:43:21.358 --> 01:43:27.411
MARISHA: We're all rolling terrible tonight.

01:43:27.411 --> 01:43:33.199
MATT: You get so caught up with the flow of the
loogie that you keep leaning forward further and

01:43:33.199 --> 01:43:36.733
further trying to figure it out as your heels lift
up.

01:43:36.733 --> 01:43:37.825
IVAN: Woo!

01:43:37.825 --> 01:43:43.231
MATT: You guys watch as Grizznak suddenly tips
forward and goes over the edge.

01:43:43.231 --> 01:43:44.850
ASHLY: Well, he's dead.

01:43:44.850 --> 01:43:48.675
IVAN: Is anyone going to catch me? Because I'm
going to sing my song.

01:43:48.675 --> 01:43:54.856
ASHLY: I can try to catch you. What would that be?
Or would it be acrobatics?

01:43:54.856 --> 01:43:59.422
MATT: This would be a straight up, I would say,
dexterity. Go ahead and roll a dexterity check on

01:43:59.422 --> 01:44:02.182
this one to see if you can be fast enough to
grab.

01:44:02.182 --> 01:44:03.515
TALIESIN: I'll join her in it.

01:44:03.515 --> 01:44:05.370
MARISHA: I'll join. We'll make goblin--

01:44:05.370 --> 01:44:07.633
PHIL: This is the last time I save your ass.

01:44:07.633 --> 01:44:08.633
ASHLY: Seven.

01:44:08.633 --> 01:44:15.654
MARISHA: Goblin chain. We're going to goblin chain
this. Everyone loop together.

01:44:15.654 --> 01:44:17.620
PHIL: 21.

01:44:17.620 --> 01:44:19.776
TALIESIN: 13.

01:44:19.776 --> 01:44:23.624
MATT: Oh, you're not helping. You're watching.

01:44:23.624 --> 01:44:29.695
MARISHA: No I'm goblin chaining this with them.
Straight dexterity? 20, total.

01:44:29.695 --> 01:44:33.741
MATT: 20, okay. Piglet reaches forward and goes
over, too.

01:44:33.741 --> 01:44:37.721
ASHLY: Oh god. My hubris.

01:44:37.721 --> 01:44:41.670
MATT: As they both begin to tumble over the edge,
you grab and you both slip forward. The three of

01:44:41.670 --> 01:44:46.613
you manage to grab the back of Piglet and pull her
up and slowly, you guys get back up into the

01:44:46.613 --> 01:44:54.378
tunnel. No, no, no. Piglet managed to grab the
very back of Grizznak and pull him back up.

01:44:54.378 --> 01:44:58.635
MARISHA: Damn, guys. We're badasses, just like we
practiced. Good work.

01:44:58.635 --> 01:45:01.854
MATT: Grizznak, you're really frustrated because
you swear you were this close to seeing when that

01:45:01.854 --> 01:45:03.457
thing would drop before you got pulled up.

01:45:03.457 --> 01:45:07.495
IVAN: Guys, what's the big deal? I was almost
there. I almost saw it. Oh, hi.

01:45:07.495 --> 01:45:09.642
PHIL: No more saving you.

01:45:09.642 --> 01:45:17.326
ASHLY: I have an alternate plan. What if I throw
one of you across to the other side?

01:45:17.326 --> 01:45:24.916
PHIL: Hmm. I have another alternate alternate
plan. I look to see if there is any way to climb up.

01:45:24.916 --> 01:45:27.500
MATT: Okay. Make a perception check.

01:45:27.500 --> 01:45:33.868
PHIL: Math is killing me. 24.

01:45:33.868 --> 01:45:38.580
MATT: You glance upon the sides of the stonework
on the inside of this giant cylindrical cistern

01:45:38.580 --> 01:45:46.784
that leads up to the where all the water's pouring
in from. Glancing about, there are very, very

01:45:46.784 --> 01:45:53.822
sparsely set stones that are slightly more
protruding than the rest. You gather they could be

01:45:53.822 --> 01:46:02.199
leapt from stone to stone, if one is so interested
in being a good climber. So there is a way, yeah.

01:46:02.199 --> 01:46:13.586
ASHLY: Goblin toss. That other thing, that sounds
way boring. Goblin toss. Boring.

01:46:13.586 --> 01:46:15.284
TALIESIN: I volunteer as tribute!

01:46:15.284 --> 01:46:17.512
ASHLY: Yeah! You want me to toss you?

01:46:17.512 --> 01:46:20.372
TALIESIN: I tie the rope to my waist and I tie the
rope to her.

01:46:20.372 --> 01:46:21.831
PHIL: All the way across?

01:46:21.831 --> 01:46:23.050
ASHLY: All the way across.

01:46:23.050 --> 01:46:24.804
TALIESIN: I have 50 feet of rope.

01:46:24.804 --> 01:46:28.497
MATT: Mezek ties the rope around. Who gets the
other end of the rope?

01:46:28.497 --> 01:46:29.911
TALIESIN: Give it to Piglet.

01:46:29.911 --> 01:46:32.108
MATT: Okay. Piglet, you have one side of the rope
now.

01:46:32.108 --> 01:46:34.311
ASHLY: I'm going to start swinging him around.

01:46:34.311 --> 01:46:38.917
MATT: Okay. Because there isn't a lot of-- Roll a
strength check.

01:46:38.917 --> 01:46:42.461
TALIESIN: I approve of this plan on every level.

01:46:42.461 --> 01:46:43.929
ASHLY: 12.

01:46:43.929 --> 01:46:48.309
MATT: 12. So you swing him around once before you
realize that, because you're up against a wall

01:46:48.309 --> 01:46:56.708
there's not a whole lot of space and (impact) into
the stonework. You take one point of bludgeoning

01:46:56.708 --> 01:47:01.805
damage, hitting the side as he slips down and then
is now dangling and you can pull him back up.

01:47:01.805 --> 01:47:03.581
TALIESIN: All right. Toss--

01:47:03.581 --> 01:47:08.766
MATT: There's a big gap in Mezek's grin as a tooth
is now missing from that.

01:47:08.766 --> 01:47:11.305
ASHLY: It looks good. It suits you.

01:47:11.305 --> 01:47:12.810
TALIESIN: It was hurting already.

01:47:12.810 --> 01:47:14.022
PHIL: More space to eat.

01:47:14.022 --> 01:47:17.848
TALIESIN: Yeah. Strawholder. All right.

01:47:17.848 --> 01:47:19.679
ASHLY: All right. Well, that's all my plans.

01:47:19.679 --> 01:47:22.218
PHIL: You're not going to throw him across?

01:47:22.218 --> 01:47:25.022
ASHLY: Oh wait. I could toss him across. Is there
something on the other side? Did I make that up?

01:47:25.022 --> 01:47:26.788
Is there more path?

01:47:26.788 --> 01:47:30.301
MATT: Looking across the way, you can see there is
another opening, 80 feet across.

01:47:30.301 --> 01:47:32.198
ASHLY: Shall I try to toss him?

01:47:32.198 --> 01:47:34.830
TALIESIN: Well, I only have 50 feet of rope. That
would have gone poorly.

01:47:34.830 --> 01:47:36.914
MATT: You can try.

01:47:36.914 --> 01:47:39.455
ASHLY: Do you still volunteer as tribute?

01:47:39.455 --> 01:47:41.750
MARISHA: I volunteer.

01:47:41.750 --> 01:47:43.291
ASHLY: You volunteer?

01:47:43.291 --> 01:47:47.691
MARISHA: I think I have a plan. It only works for
me though, but fuck you guys.

01:47:47.691 --> 01:47:49.400
ASHLY: All right, I'm going to toss you.

01:47:49.400 --> 01:47:59.679
MARISHA: Wait, first I take out a bottle and I
drink it. And I shrink. I take my Reduce Person vial.

01:47:59.679 --> 01:48:08.509
MATT: Extract. Okay. What is normal-sized Snizzler
shrinks down to about half the size now. Voice is

01:48:08.509 --> 01:48:12.550
higher, appearance is ridiculous. You guys now all
can't help but chuckle at this.

01:48:12.550 --> 01:48:19.994
MARISHA: Okay. Are you ready to throw me? Let's
try this.

01:48:19.994 --> 01:48:21.255
ASHLY: You're so dumb.

01:48:21.255 --> 01:48:23.567
MARISHA: What are you guys laughing at? What?
Don't-- (garble)

01:48:23.567 --> 01:48:26.345
ASHLY: You're small. You're comparatively smaller
to us now.

01:48:26.345 --> 01:48:32.748
IVAN: I take her little tiny arms and I start
making her dance like a little doll.

01:48:32.748 --> 01:48:34.245
MARISHA: Stop it.

01:48:34.245 --> 01:48:41.457
IVAN: My name's Snizzler. Snizzler, Snizzler,
Snizzler. I like to fly. I like to fly.

01:48:41.457 --> 01:48:43.166
MARISHA: Mom! Mom!

01:48:43.166 --> 01:48:45.986
MATT: Snizzler, you immediately regret this
decision.

01:48:45.986 --> 01:48:48.866
ASHLY: All right, now I'm going to toss you.
Okay.

01:48:48.866 --> 01:48:54.536
IVAN: I'm going to, just for shits and giggles,
I'm going to also cast Breeze.

01:48:54.536 --> 01:48:59.038
ASHLY and MARISHA: 20!

01:48:59.038 --> 01:49:00.665
MATT: A natural 20?

01:49:00.665 --> 01:49:02.353
ASHLY: 23 all together.

01:49:02.353 --> 01:49:05.767
TALIESIN: It's the Golden Snitch, man. Don't fuck
with the Golden Snitch.

01:49:05.767 --> 01:49:17.163
MATT: So you take this tiny goblin, lick your
grimy finger, feel the wind, point Sir Ruth style

01:49:17.163 --> 01:49:32.456
and shotput. Snizzler arcs forward, much farther
than you expected. Overward, you see in the

01:49:32.456 --> 01:49:35.005
distance-- rope not attached, by the way.

01:49:35.005 --> 01:49:37.484
MARISHA: You guys, it's beautiful from up here.

01:49:37.484 --> 01:49:43.372
MATT: Over. It comes up and you can see, you may
or may not be close enough to the ledge, oh god,

01:49:43.372 --> 01:49:49.699
it's right there before you. Go ahead and make an
acrobatics check in the middle of the air to try

01:49:49.699 --> 01:49:52.007
and maneuver yourself in the air to catch--

01:49:52.007 --> 01:49:56.393
MARISHA: Hang on, wait. She rolled the Golden
Snitch. Let me roll my golden. Not, not--

01:49:56.393 --> 01:49:58.342
TALIESIN: I was about to say, that Golden Snitch
never rolls well, though.

01:49:58.342 --> 01:50:01.448
MARISHA: It never rolls well. Wait, this is just a
dexterity?

01:50:01.448 --> 01:50:02.636
IVAN: Acrobatics.

01:50:02.636 --> 01:50:04.486
MARISHA: 12.

01:50:04.486 --> 01:50:05.660
MATT: 12.

01:50:05.660 --> 01:50:11.707
ASHLY: Oh no. Wait, is it song time? Is it song time?

01:50:11.707 --> 01:50:13.949
IVAN: Song time. Sing your song.

01:50:13.949 --> 01:50:15.638
MARISHA: What? Am I falling now?

01:50:15.638 --> 01:50:18.414
MATT: It's up to you. If you want to let it go.
You can sing your song and go for a reroll.

01:50:18.414 --> 01:50:26.114
MARISHA: I guess it's song time. As I'm still
soaring, in my tiny voice, I say (sing) Snizzler,

01:50:26.114 --> 01:50:35.757
zazzlers, sizzler, zaz. Eyebrows this goblin once
had. My bombs go boom, they never miss. Hi

01:50:35.757 --> 01:50:39.003
Homeland Security, because now I'm on the
watchlist.

01:50:39.003 --> 01:50:42.271
TALIESIN: It's funny because it's true.

01:50:42.271 --> 01:50:44.175
MARISHA: Yes. Yes, it is.

01:50:44.175 --> 01:50:46.343
MATT: Go ahead and reroll that acrobatics check.

01:50:46.343 --> 01:50:47.749
PHIL: Don't use that die.

01:50:47.749 --> 01:50:49.373
MARISHA: I'll use this one.

01:50:49.373 --> 01:50:51.355
IVAN: Got to get better. Got to get--

01:50:51.355 --> 01:50:57.037
ASHLY: Did it get worse? What is with the
rerolling?

01:50:57.037 --> 01:50:58.105
MARISHA: Ten.

01:50:58.105 --> 01:51:06.327
MATT: So, Piglet. You had this. This isn't your
fault. Stupid bomb goblin can't catch a ledge. But

01:51:06.327 --> 01:51:11.534
you like, you cross your arms and look around,
just so everyone else understands that it wasn't you.

01:51:11.534 --> 01:51:12.959
IVAN: Good try, Piglet.

01:51:12.959 --> 01:51:17.721
MATT: (splashing) Into the water below.

01:51:17.721 --> 01:51:19.748
MARISHA: I hate water.

01:51:19.748 --> 01:51:22.209
PHIL: She really does.

01:51:22.209 --> 01:51:24.572
ASHLY: Hey. He didn't die.

01:51:24.572 --> 01:51:26.733
MATT: I do need you to make a swim check.

01:51:26.733 --> 01:51:39.602
MARISHA: I'm fucking terrible at swimming. Oh god.
Okay. Well, I rolled a 14 and I have a minus four,

01:51:39.602 --> 01:51:41.693
to my swim. So ten.

01:51:41.693 --> 01:51:47.874
MATT: So you're treading water and slowly making
your way across this giant cistern, about 20 feet

01:51:47.874 --> 01:51:54.304
below where they are. You get halfway across,
splashing. You guys see Snizzler trying to make

01:51:54.304 --> 01:51:56.346
her way over to where you guys are.

01:51:56.346 --> 01:51:59.127
IVAN: (laughing) There's water down there.

01:51:59.127 --> 01:52:01.251
MARISHA: Seriously, you guys.

01:52:01.251 --> 01:52:05.236
MATT: Roll another swim check to try and make it
the other half of the way.

01:52:05.236 --> 01:52:07.263
IVAN: Come on, Snizzler.

01:52:07.263 --> 01:52:12.036
MARISHA: Oh, that's better. 13.

01:52:12.036 --> 01:52:16.564
MATT: 13. You make your way up to the edge, like
(grunting). You guys can look down now and you can

01:52:16.564 --> 01:52:22.610
just barely see outside of your darkvision here,
you see Snizzler approach and is now treading

01:52:22.610 --> 01:52:24.645
water at the bottom of the cistern below you.

01:52:24.645 --> 01:52:26.886
ASHLY: We'll lower the ropes, Snizz.

01:52:26.886 --> 01:52:33.850
MARISHA: Come on. Can I see if I can find purchase
on a little rock? Off to the side, I can hold onto.

01:52:33.850 --> 01:52:36.877
MATT: Yeah. You go over and reach over and you
grab a rock and pull onto it and pull your weight

01:52:36.877 --> 01:52:41.775
up and your fingers slip off of it. There is a
slick liquid from general grime.

01:52:41.775 --> 01:52:43.185
IVAN: Grab the rope.

01:52:43.185 --> 01:52:46.231
MARISHA: Come on! Come on.

01:52:46.231 --> 01:52:47.370
TALIESIN: I drop the rope.

01:52:47.370 --> 01:52:50.264
MATT: Okay. The rope (thumps) into the water next
to you. You grab onto it and the rest of you guys

01:52:50.264 --> 01:52:54.708
slowly pull Snizzler back up onto the
entranceway.

01:52:54.708 --> 01:53:00.775
IVAN: My turn. My turn. I want to be thrown next.
My turn.

01:53:00.775 --> 01:53:04.569
TALIESIN: I'm going to look at the ceiling. I want
to see if there is anywhere we can attach the rope

01:53:04.569 --> 01:53:06.444
to the ceiling to make a swing.

01:53:06.444 --> 01:53:12.595
MATT: Currently, it is a dome, a smooth stone dome
that then has three openings where the rainwater

01:53:12.595 --> 01:53:15.164
is pouring into currently and filling the bottom
of the cistern.

01:53:15.164 --> 01:53:18.744
ASHLY: So the only way up is basically those
little stones? That we can see.

01:53:18.744 --> 01:53:24.353
IVAN: The only other thing I can think of, taking
my Snizzler hat off for a sec-- er, my Grizznak--

01:53:24.353 --> 01:53:32.013
is I could potentially Mage Hand up the rope. But
I don't think I can tie it, I can just move it up.

01:53:32.013 --> 01:53:37.123
PHIL: You know what? No, I'll climb up and tie the
rope. And everyone else can climb.

01:53:37.123 --> 01:53:38.915
IVAN: We'll catch you if you fall.

01:53:38.915 --> 01:53:44.900
PHIL: Right. That'll happen. I climb up to the
grate, with the rope.

01:53:44.900 --> 01:53:47.525
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and roll a climb check.

01:53:47.525 --> 01:53:55.000
PHIL: 12 plus climb. 18.

01:53:55.000 --> 01:54:01.903
MATT: 18. As you pull yourself up (grunting) and
it is a slight curvature, so you're, like, hanging

01:54:01.903 --> 01:54:08.083
and holding onto it, but in true goblin Tom Cruise
fashion, keeping a stern expression on your face.

01:54:08.083 --> 01:54:10.264
PHIL: Well, you know Tom Cruise is a goblin.
That's why he's so small.

01:54:10.264 --> 01:54:12.180
MATT: Makes sense. Hopping on the sofa.

01:54:12.180 --> 01:54:15.293
PHIL: (goblin noise) I'm in love. I'm in love. I'm
in love.

01:54:15.293 --> 01:54:22.017
MATT: As you pull yourself up, tiny goblin feet
dangling below, keeping your focus, Browntooth,

01:54:22.017 --> 01:54:28.167
you bring your way across the ceiling, carrying
that rope in your grin. You get up to the edge of

01:54:28.167 --> 01:54:33.698
where the water's currently pouring into the
cistern and it's moving past, I need you to roll

01:54:33.698 --> 01:54:36.519
another climb check to try and keep holding.

01:54:36.519 --> 01:54:38.909
PHIL: Nine.

01:54:38.909 --> 01:54:42.549
MATT: Nine. Your fingers are starting to slip.
You're starting to slip.

01:54:42.549 --> 01:54:47.018
IVAN: Can I cast Open on the grate and see if
it'll maybe lift him up with it open?

01:54:47.018 --> 01:54:49.851
MATT: Yeah. You know what, for a--

01:54:49.851 --> 01:54:51.654
IVAN: Do you want me to grab it?

01:54:51.654 --> 01:54:54.842
MATT: Yeah. Let's see if we can. What's the spell?
This is Open?

01:54:54.842 --> 01:54:55.960
IVAN: Open.

01:54:55.960 --> 01:55:01.443
ASHLY: I'd just like to take this moment to say
that Browntooth is clearly the coolest goblin of

01:55:01.443 --> 01:55:02.841
all the goblins.

01:55:02.841 --> 01:55:04.066
(laughter)

01:55:04.066 --> 01:55:09.633
ASHLY: He transcends space and time and climbed
a slippery wall with a rope in his mouth.

01:55:09.633 --> 01:55:10.993
PHIL: Almost climbed.

01:55:10.993 --> 01:55:12.579
MARISHA: The rest of us are total degenerates.

01:55:12.579 --> 01:55:15.196
ASHLY: I'm just throwing people, like--

01:55:15.196 --> 01:55:22.082
MATT: Yeah, there's no resistance to it. As you're
slipping, slipping, all of a sudden the grate that

01:55:22.082 --> 01:55:30.214
contains the water opens and actually slams into
your side, but you manage to catch onto it. It

01:55:30.214 --> 01:55:36.742
knocks the wind out of you, but you manage to hold
on the edge. You catch your breath and you realize

01:55:36.742 --> 01:55:41.655
this is, first off, holding your weight, and
second, there's a number of cross iron bars that

01:55:41.655 --> 01:55:44.692
are all welded together that would be a good place
probably to tie the rope off.

01:55:44.692 --> 01:55:48.022
PHIL: I think I will tie the rope to the things
that would make a good place to tie the rope.

01:55:48.022 --> 01:55:49.632
IVAN: You're welcome!

01:55:49.632 --> 01:55:54.236
PHIL: Yeah, right. I saved your life, you saved
mine-- twice.

01:55:54.236 --> 01:55:58.428
IVAN Well, you know what? Now we've got one left.

01:55:58.428 --> 01:56:00.520
PHIL: One left.

01:56:00.520 --> 01:56:07.143
IVAN: Which means I owe you a bird. (sings) Birdy
bird bird bird bird. Bird for you, bird for me.

01:56:07.143 --> 01:56:11.731
Two birds for you and one bird for me. Smash it,
twist it, turn it in a stew. Stick it in your face

01:56:11.731 --> 01:56:14.208
and you love-- and I love you.

01:56:14.208 --> 01:56:16.068
MARISHA: I love that song.

01:56:16.068 --> 01:56:17.325
PHIL: He's got many songs.

01:56:17.325 --> 01:56:18.681
TALIESIN: Very impressive.

01:56:18.681 --> 01:56:23.812
MATT As you finish tying the rope, helping each
person up, each of you manage to climb, having it

01:56:23.812 --> 01:56:27.987
tossed back. It takes you a while to get going,
but you do manage to--

01:56:27.987 --> 01:56:31.150
PHIL We've now been on this quest for five days.

01:56:31.150 --> 01:56:37.801
TALIESIN In my head it's all Henson puppets, and
it's adorable. It's like Fraggle Rock, I'm there.

01:56:37.801 --> 01:56:41.142
(cheering)

01:56:41.142 --> 01:56:45.314
ASHLY: The other goblin crew has already made it,
they've got the stone, they're back. That's what's

01:56:45.314 --> 01:56:48.194
already happened in my head. I'll be disappointed
if that's not what happens.

01:56:48.194 --> 01:56:51.723
MATT: In climbing up the side of the grate,
however, going on the other side, you are now

01:56:51.723 --> 01:56:55.527
fighting against the torrent of water so I need
each of you to make a climb check.

01:56:55.527 --> 01:56:57.575
MARISHA: Oh we're all doing this?

01:56:57.575 --> 01:56:58.648
TALIESIN: Yeah, yeah.

01:56:58.648 --> 01:57:00.664
MATT: You don't have to, you can stay back in the
sewers.

01:57:00.664 --> 01:57:02.965
PHIL: Wait for the fire to come.

01:57:02.965 --> 01:57:04.545
ASHLY: 14.

01:57:04.545 --> 01:57:06.889
MARISHA: Oh my god.

01:57:06.889 --> 01:57:08.958
PHIL: 16.

01:57:08.958 --> 01:57:10.092
TALIESIN: Nine.

01:57:10.092 --> 01:57:12.055
MARISHA: Three?

01:57:12.055 --> 01:57:15.069
MATT; (laughing) What do you have, Grizznak?

01:57:15.069 --> 01:57:16.678
IVAN: Two.

01:57:16.678 --> 01:57:18.734
MATT Two? Okay. So--

01:57:18.734 --> 01:57:24.151
PHIL: Who do we have to save now?

01:57:24.151 --> 01:57:33.141
MATT: We'll say for the sake of brevity here, an
additional hour or so is spent perpetually

01:57:33.141 --> 01:57:38.238
retrieving your allies who keep getting all the
way up and then (splash) right into the water. But

01:57:38.238 --> 01:57:43.806
you have to admire the tenacity.

01:57:43.806 --> 01:57:46.936
TALIESIN: I drink everything in my flask at this
point.

01:57:46.936 --> 01:57:49.391
MATT: Okay, so you get your Ki point going.

01:57:49.391 --> 01:57:50.965
TALIESIN: I've got to keep drinking.

01:57:50.965 --> 01:57:56.041
MATT: Eventually you guys make your way up past
the flowing of water, which has slowed now, and

01:57:56.041 --> 01:57:58.728
that's probably how you're able to do it.

01:57:58.728 --> 01:58:01.510
TALIESIN: Someone upstairs finally jiggled the
toilet.

01:58:01.510 --> 01:58:09.672
MATT: Yeah. You make your way up into an upper
sewage system, and you guys crawl through what is

01:58:09.672 --> 01:58:14.710
a much smaller series of pipes, to the point where
you as goblins still have to crawl to make your

01:58:14.710 --> 01:58:19.748
way through. The sludge is thicker here and what
little bit of rain is pouring through you manage

01:58:19.748 --> 01:58:27.056
to keep between your arms and legs. Eventually you
find your way into the bottom of some sort of a

01:58:27.056 --> 01:58:31.921
chamber that is filled with apparently human
waste.

01:58:31.921 --> 01:58:33.150
TALIESIN: Yes.

01:58:33.150 --> 01:58:38.006
ASHLY: The blue poop has to be here.

01:58:38.006 --> 01:58:46.555
MARISHA: I take the poop and I start making a ball
out of it and I light it to see how flammable it is.

01:58:46.555 --> 01:58:47.796
MATT: Okay.

01:58:47.796 --> 01:58:50.422
IVAN: This is totally logical.

01:58:50.422 --> 01:58:53.467
PHIL: If it were church people, they drink a lot,
so it should light up.

01:58:53.467 --> 01:59:01.772
MATT: Like the finest of candles, it does catch
fire and begins to burn slowly. It's not dry

01:59:01.772 --> 01:59:05.346
enough to catch-- we're having this conversation.

01:59:05.346 --> 01:59:08.506
TALIESIN: No, I'm really excited that this is a
thing that's happening right now.

01:59:08.506 --> 01:59:13.808
MATT: It would need to be suitably dried out to
work as proper fuel, but--

01:59:13.808 --> 01:59:21.112
MARISHA: Definitely lots of alcohol, lots of
drugs, yeah. I start packaging up some of the poop.

01:59:21.112 --> 01:59:22.155
MATT: All right.

01:59:22.155 --> 01:59:25.078
PHIL: I look for any sort of egress.

01:59:25.078 --> 01:59:27.109
MATT: Make a perception check.

01:59:27.109 --> 01:59:28.170
IVAN: Same.

01:59:28.170 --> 01:59:30.937
ASHLY: Why not, I'll do it too.

01:59:30.937 --> 01:59:32.335
IVAN: 16.

01:59:32.335 --> 01:59:33.525
PHIL: Eight.

01:59:33.525 --> 01:59:34.654
ASHLY: 18.

01:59:34.654 --> 01:59:41.414
MATT: All right. While you're collecting your
filthy prize, both Piglet and Grizznek, you guys

01:59:41.414 --> 01:59:49.290
look up and notice that there is a wooden or stone
ceiling, but a singular opening above you. Like a

01:59:49.290 --> 01:59:50.697
circular hole.

01:59:50.697 --> 01:59:55.704
IVAN: First, I would like to listen to see if
there's any stinky, stupid humans upstairs.

01:59:55.704 --> 01:59:58.750
MATT: Make a perception check.

01:59:58.750 --> 02:00:03.056
IVAN: (singing) Stinky stupid humans. Eight.

02:00:03.056 --> 02:00:06.051
PHIL: I love that game. Stinky stupid humans!

02:00:06.051 --> 02:00:11.703
IVAN: They're so dumb. Stinky stupid humans, but
they're fun-- to kill!

02:00:11.703 --> 02:00:19.889
MATT: You listen and you hear the muffled noises
of conversation as well. It sounds like there are

02:00:19.889 --> 02:00:26.144
a few different voices, though they're behind a
couple of walls from where you are.

02:00:26.144 --> 02:00:27.469
IVAN: So they're not straight above us?

02:00:27.469 --> 02:00:28.491
MATT: No.

02:00:28.491 --> 02:00:32.538
IVAN: I'm going to cast Open again on that
opening.

02:00:32.538 --> 02:00:35.538
MATT: Okay. You cast Open. The opening is open.

02:00:35.538 --> 02:00:37.242
(laughter)

02:00:37.242 --> 02:00:39.045
MATT: So the spell is a success!

02:00:39.045 --> 02:00:42.715
IVAN: Yes! I will climb up through the poop
chute.

02:00:42.715 --> 02:00:49.557
MATT: As you pull yourself up out of it, in a
wonderful medieval version of the Ghoulies VHS

02:00:49.557 --> 02:00:51.836
cover, you pull yourself out from--

02:00:51.836 --> 02:00:55.030
TALIESIN: Wow, we went back.

02:00:55.030 --> 02:00:59.905
MATT: Oh man, I couldn't go near toilets for years
because of that movie cover at the VHS store.

02:00:59.905 --> 02:01:04.178
IVAN: I stick my head up and I look through the
toilet seat and then I go (blows nose) and knock a

02:01:04.178 --> 02:01:06.104
huge chunk of poop out of my nostril.

02:01:06.104 --> 02:01:09.571
MATT: There you go. Glancing ahead, your Open
spell missed, but did hit the front of the

02:01:09.571 --> 02:01:17.671
outhouse which has currently swung open in the
mid-day, facing the window leading into the tavern

02:01:17.671 --> 02:01:20.667
that you guys nearly entered beforehand.

02:01:20.667 --> 02:01:22.372
IVAN: Oh. Close.

02:01:22.372 --> 02:01:29.186
MATT: Closes shut. However, it does appear to be
nestled in an alleyway on the outside of it. It's

02:01:29.186 --> 02:01:32.664
a very thin opening. You didn't see any people
actually in the alley. You saw the outside of a

02:01:32.664 --> 02:01:34.819
window and a street thoroughfare.

02:01:34.819 --> 02:01:36.642
IVAN: Mmm.

02:01:36.642 --> 02:01:37.821
PHIL: Where are we?

02:01:37.821 --> 02:01:45.418
IVAN: We're outside now. We seem to be in what the
humans use to get rid of all their precious waste.

02:01:45.418 --> 02:01:47.018
TALIESIN: We're inside an outhouse?

02:01:47.018 --> 02:01:50.918
PHIL: That sounds sort of oxymoronic.

02:01:50.918 --> 02:01:57.122
IVAN: We're in one of those redundant human cubes
in which humans go to poop inside of instead of

02:01:57.122 --> 02:02:00.202
doing it where they sleep, which is way more
practical.

02:02:00.202 --> 02:02:07.701
ASHLY: Wait, guys, those church things-- isn't
there like a symbol that people use, like a circle

02:02:07.701 --> 02:02:09.192
or like--?

02:02:09.192 --> 02:02:13.530
IVAN: Well, I say we get Browntooth up here and he
can go scout it out. Right, Browntooth?

02:02:13.530 --> 02:02:21.246
PHIL: If it keeps you from blowing things up, and
you setting anything on fire. Right, I climb up

02:02:21.246 --> 02:02:28.901
and go out the outhouse to stealthily move into the
street.

02:02:28.901 --> 02:02:32.205
MATT: All righty. So, as you--

02:02:32.205 --> 02:02:37.196
IVAN: Wait, wait, wait. I'm also going to cast
Penumbra on him.

02:02:37.196 --> 02:02:38.327
MATT: Okay.

02:02:38.327 --> 02:02:41.916
IVAN: So, Penumbra, it basically puts a permanent
shadow on him.

02:02:41.916 --> 02:02:45.279
PHIL: Oh. I thought it gave me a number from
before.

02:02:45.279 --> 02:02:47.065
(laughs)

02:02:47.065 --> 02:02:49.059
MATT: Go ahead and roll a stealth check, if you
could.

02:02:49.059 --> 02:02:56.505
IVAN: Makes it so that even light spells make him
still look like he's covered in shadow.

02:02:56.505 --> 02:02:58.705
PHIL: 32.

02:02:58.765 --> 02:03:01.875
MATT: All right. As you stumble into the shady
alley, looking about, you glance over the side of

02:03:01.875 --> 02:03:05.505
the window real fast into the tavern, and you do
see there are probably a dozen patrons in there.

02:03:05.505 --> 02:03:11.783
Some drinks being served, a guard at the door on
the inside. However, looking to your left, there

02:03:11.783 --> 02:03:16.058
the alleyway spills out into a main street
thoroughfare, and you can see people walking by,

02:03:16.058 --> 02:03:23.483
families with children. There's a general air of
jovial energy to it, and some people are wearing

02:03:23.483 --> 02:03:29.149
flower crowns on their heads. You can see
carts being put along the street. Seems like the

02:03:29.149 --> 02:03:34.439
festival you were told of, this terrible, human
festival seems to be in full swing. Go ahead and

02:03:34.439 --> 02:03:36.725
make a survival check.

02:03:36.725 --> 02:03:39.058
PHIL: 16.

02:03:39.058 --> 02:03:46.732
MATT: You come out to the edge of the alleyway,
glance about. First thing you notice is the sun in

02:03:46.732 --> 02:03:52.101
the sky. You were like "eh, it's probably
mid-day-ish". No, it's pushing toward sunset now.

02:03:52.101 --> 02:03:54.833
You probably have another hour of sunlight. So
you don't know how much longer this festival's

02:03:54.833 --> 02:03:59.219
going to be going. You spent quite a while getting
here and wandering the sewers.

02:03:59.219 --> 02:04:01.861
IVAN: As per typical goblin fashion.

02:04:01.861 --> 02:04:10.928
MATT: Indeed. However, you notice that everyone is
walking a certain direction. And, one, there are a

02:04:10.928 --> 02:04:21.727
number of carts that are going by. There are
currently unmanned, closed carts that would be

02:04:21.727 --> 02:04:28.996
used to sell fruit and fish. This being a port
town, fish is a big export here. And the alleyways

02:04:28.996 --> 02:04:33.209
that you came out of? There is a second alleyway
that offshoots from where the outhouse is that

02:04:33.209 --> 02:04:38.444
goes between the buildings off the main
thoroughfare. This is what you're able to gauge in

02:04:38.444 --> 02:04:39.901
your time out here.

02:04:39.901 --> 02:04:51.216
PHIL: I go back and tell them what I've seen. So
everybody's going that way.

02:04:51.216 --> 02:04:53.643
IVAN: We should probably go--

02:04:53.643 --> 02:04:57.461
ALL: That way?

02:04:57.461 --> 02:04:59.084
IVAN: That way.

02:04:59.084 --> 02:05:00.161
ASHLY: That way!

02:05:00.161 --> 02:05:07.002
MARISHA: Maybe if we get on each others' shoulders
with a coat, we'll look like peoples!

02:05:07.002 --> 02:05:14.733
ASHLY: I want do a perception roll for a big coat.
14.

02:05:14.733 --> 02:05:20.670
MATT: You glance over the window and look inside.
One of the bar patrons, sitting by the bar, is

02:05:20.670 --> 02:05:31.296
this rotund-looking gentleman in his late 40s.
Balding hair, a double chin, leaned forward on the

02:05:31.296 --> 02:05:35.975
bar, looking like he's ready to pass out from the
amount of alcohol he's been drinking. He is in the

02:05:35.975 --> 02:05:39.216
inside of the tavern. He has a very long coat that
drapes past the bar.

02:05:39.216 --> 02:05:43.024
ASHLY: We got to do it! There's no alternative!

02:05:43.024 --> 02:05:49.599
PHIL: There is an alternative! There's the little
alleyway!

02:05:49.599 --> 02:05:55.031
ASHLY: No alternative! This is what we're doing.
How many patrons are there? Do I get to know from

02:05:55.031 --> 02:05:56.293
my perception check?

02:05:56.293 --> 02:05:59.562
MATT: Glancing in there, you see probably ten
patrons altogether.

02:05:59.562 --> 02:06:05.125
MARISHA: I look around. Do I see anything that
looks like a children's clothing store? Maybe two

02:06:05.125 --> 02:06:07.976
of us can be a child and three of us can be an
adult.

02:06:07.976 --> 02:06:12.021
IVAN: If each one of us is a leg, and we're three
goblins tall, that's six feet.

02:06:12.021 --> 02:06:14.053
MARISHA: Okay, yeah, no, you're right, Grizz.

02:06:14.053 --> 02:06:18.125
PHIL: Look for a cow costume. Perception check for
a cow costume.

02:06:18.125 --> 02:06:21.726
IVAN: I'll cast Penumbra on you, so at least
you'll be in shadow.

02:06:21.726 --> 02:06:27.151
ASHLY: And then I could stealth. Well, your
stealth is insane, actually. He has +20 stealth.

02:06:27.151 --> 02:06:30.797
TALIESIN: I've got very high stealth, too, so I'm
going to come in with this.

02:06:30.797 --> 02:06:33.992
ASHLY: You guys should go in and get the coat!
I'll go in, too!

02:06:33.992 --> 02:06:36.390
TALIESIN: We're going to sneak in to get the
coat.

02:06:36.390 --> 02:06:38.464
MARISHA: I'll stand guard and watch outside the
window.

02:06:38.464 --> 02:06:40.741
PHIL: I still have my Penumbra, right?

02:06:40.741 --> 02:06:41.793
IVAN: Penumbra.

02:06:41.793 --> 02:06:48.662
MATT: You do not have Penumbra because he cast it
on her, right? Or is it a once at a time thing, or

02:06:48.662 --> 02:06:50.518
can you do multiple people?

02:06:50.518 --> 02:06:52.988
IVAN: That's a good question. Shit. It's in the
Ultimate Magic book.

02:06:52.988 --> 02:06:56.840
MATT: We'll say, for the time being, it affects
both of you. It's fine. Using the shadows around

02:06:56.840 --> 02:07:01.191
you, it's getting late. The angle of the sun,
shadows are not too hard to find. Roll stealth

02:07:01.191 --> 02:07:07.163
checks, all three of you, as you make your way
along the side, darting between barrels and trying

02:07:07.163 --> 02:07:11.794
to find a way into the tavern from the window,
other than the front door.

02:07:11.794 --> 02:07:12.908
ASHLY: 30.

02:07:12.908 --> 02:07:14.156
TALIESIN: 31.

02:07:14.156 --> 02:07:15.241
PHIL: 33.

02:07:15.241 --> 02:07:27.040
MATT: Woo! You guys duck behind every single
possible piece of discarded material, empty crates

02:07:27.040 --> 02:07:32.200
and boxes, barrels that are available. You jump at
certain times, following the lead of Browntooth.

02:07:32.200 --> 02:07:38.449
You manage to find your way through the
thoroughfare to an entrance to the kitchen on the

02:07:38.449 --> 02:07:42.839
side of this tavern. The door is partially ajar.
You look in and there is one person manning the

02:07:42.839 --> 02:07:49.258
kitchen. You see this poor, older woman, who is in
the process of running around with four things

02:07:49.258 --> 02:07:57.671
burning and is like, "There's too many! I hate
festivals! Coming!" She's not paying attention to

02:07:57.671 --> 02:07:59.204
the door right now.

02:07:59.204 --> 02:08:00.617
ASHLY: So we could stealth by her, too?

02:08:00.617 --> 02:08:01.454
MATT: You could try.

02:08:01.454 --> 02:08:03.050
PHIL: Or we could kill her.

02:08:03.050 --> 02:08:07.671
ASHLY: Look, I know I'm a goblin and I love human
blood, but she looks like she's trying her best,

02:08:07.671 --> 02:08:08.944
you know?

02:08:08.944 --> 02:08:13.069
MATT: She seems largely distracted. You guys, with
your current stealth, not an issue. You make your

02:08:13.069 --> 02:08:19.294
way through the kitchen unnoticed. You make your
way into the tavern proper. You can see a handful

02:08:19.294 --> 02:08:23.060
of patrons around a table playing cards, talking to
each other. You hear a couple of them. One

02:08:23.060 --> 02:08:28.636
person's like, "Stupid tradition. I'm just going
to stay here and drink until I care." Takes a big

02:08:28.636 --> 02:08:36.093
old sip. Somebody on the other side of the table
goes, "Speeches every year, speeches! Father

02:08:36.093 --> 02:08:43.495
"Zantas has shown that religion has no sense of
brevity!" You see this other guy at the far end

02:08:43.495 --> 02:08:49.425
table gets up, "And what about you, Zed?" And
slaps the shoulder of the guy who has the large

02:08:49.425 --> 02:08:55.194
coat on. He's leaning forward and goes, "At least
the meals were good. I'm probably going to skip

02:08:55.194 --> 02:09:05.349
"out on the consecration. I've no stomach for
prayer these days." He's face down on the bar

02:09:05.349 --> 02:09:11.379
right there. "Oh, Zed! That'll be me in an hour."
He goes and sits down at the table. There's just

02:09:11.379 --> 02:09:16.138
the barkeep at the bar who's close. Everyone else
is at the table now at the card game and Zed is

02:09:16.138 --> 02:09:18.229
passed out at the bar. What are you going to do?

02:09:18.229 --> 02:09:21.954
ASHLY: Guys, what was the name of that dude we
were supposed to find?

02:09:21.954 --> 02:09:27.121
PHIL: Something with a 'Z,' with two parts. It's
not him.

02:09:27.121 --> 02:09:28.554
ASHLY: It's not him?

02:09:28.554 --> 02:09:29.965
PHIL: He's not wearing blue.

02:09:29.965 --> 02:09:32.984
MATT: No, he's not wearing blue. He's wearing a
dark, muddy brown color.

02:09:32.984 --> 02:09:34.868
ASHLY: Let's steal his coat!

02:09:34.868 --> 02:09:39.328
MATT: All right. The three of you guys going into
this tavern area.

02:09:39.328 --> 02:09:41.269
Go ahead and roll stealth again.

02:09:41.269 --> 02:09:44.835
ASHLY: 20.

02:09:44.835 --> 02:09:48.611
MATT: Cannot roll perception for NPCs today at
all.

02:09:48.611 --> 02:09:49.936
PHIL: 34.

02:09:49.936 --> 02:09:51.033
TALIESIN: 37.

02:09:51.033 --> 02:09:55.794
MATT: You guys dart under one table, wait for a
moment, the barmaid walks by, dart under another

02:09:55.794 --> 02:10:01.456
table. You're chaining your way across this room
between these men. Eventually, finding your way

02:10:01.456 --> 02:10:08.183
right to the outside of this passed-out Zed whose
arm drifts and hangs loosely to his side. His body

02:10:08.183 --> 02:10:13.737
is half against the bar and is a good two minutes
from slumping directly onto the ground

02:10:13.737 --> 02:10:15.250
and off his stool.

02:10:15.250 --> 02:10:16.955
ASHLY: How do we steal it?

02:10:16.955 --> 02:10:18.792
PHIL: Should we wait for him to slump?

02:10:18.792 --> 02:10:25.464
MATT: The barkeep is like, "You okay, Zed?" Pokes
him a little bit.

02:10:25.464 --> 02:10:27.802
TALIESIN: (heavy sigh)

02:10:27.802 --> 02:10:31.523
MATT: "He's all right." Goes back to cleaning a
mug.

02:10:31.523 --> 02:10:39.610
ASHLY: Maybe one of us should distract the barkeep
while the other two grab the coat. Make noise in

02:10:39.610 --> 02:10:41.098
the corner or something.

02:10:41.098 --> 02:10:43.611
IVAN: We're still outside, right?

02:10:43.611 --> 02:10:44.980
MATT: Yeah, you're just waiting.

02:10:44.980 --> 02:10:49.612
IVAN: I keep casting Open and Close on the
outhouse door.

02:10:49.612 --> 02:10:52.443
MATT: (creaking) (slamming)

02:10:52.443 --> 02:10:57.663
TALIESIN: Does Zed have anything on his person
other than a coat?

02:10:57.663 --> 02:11:00.752
MATT: You can only see the coat on him right now
because it's a long trench coat.

02:11:00.752 --> 02:11:02.799
PHIL: We'll throw something to the other side of
the bar.

02:11:02.799 --> 02:11:04.385
ASHLY: Break some glasses. Really distract them.

02:11:04.385 --> 02:11:05.400
MATT: What do you throw?

02:11:05.400 --> 02:11:11.342
TALIESIN: I'm going to grab one of my goblin jag
stars and I'm going to pop one of the bottles on

02:11:11.342 --> 02:11:12.985
the shelf. I assume there's a shelf of bottles.

02:11:12.985 --> 02:11:14.197
MATT: There is a shelf of bottles.

02:11:14.197 --> 02:11:16.433
TALIESIN: I'm going to pop one on the opposite
side of us to try and knock it over.

02:11:16.433 --> 02:11:19.905
MATT: Mezek, you pull out your goblin jag star,
which is essentially the equivalent of a

02:11:19.905 --> 02:11:26.228
shuriken, but it's carved out of pieces of odd,
rusted metal that had been tied together. It's

02:11:26.228 --> 02:11:33.251
more of a cluster of broken whatever you found
from a wagon wheel that was busted weeks ago, but you throw

02:11:33.251 --> 02:11:36.128
it as a ranged weapon. Roll an attack.

02:11:36.128 --> 02:11:40.245
TALIESIN: That's 20.

02:11:40.245 --> 02:11:47.649
MATT: 20. A bottle shatters and sprays across the
back of the barkeep who's like, "Hey, what the

02:11:47.649 --> 02:11:48.766
"hell is that?!"

02:11:48.766 --> 02:11:50.140
TALIESIN: Grab it!

02:11:50.140 --> 02:11:57.025
MATT: He seems currently distracted. The three of
you together make sleight of hand checks right now

02:11:57.025 --> 02:11:59.780
as you rush up to try and pull this off.

02:11:59.780 --> 02:12:01.758
TALIESIN: Where's sleight of hand?

02:12:01.758 --> 02:12:03.747
MATT: This is probably me, sorry.

02:12:03.747 --> 02:12:06.114
IVAN: Should be under sense motive.

02:12:06.114 --> 02:12:07.677
TALIESIN: We don't have it.

02:12:07.677 --> 02:12:08.725
PHIL: I have it.

02:12:08.725 --> 02:12:13.713
MATT: So you guys aren't trained in it, so this
is going to be a basic roll, adding your dexterity

02:12:13.713 --> 02:12:14.828
modifier.

02:12:14.828 --> 02:12:16.747
ASHLY: So 11, then.

02:12:16.747 --> 02:12:18.011
PHIL: 28.

02:12:18.011 --> 02:12:19.093
TALIESIN: 19.

02:12:19.093 --> 02:12:24.033
MATT: Okay, you're all above a ten with two high
rolls, that's good. You all leap up real fast,

02:12:24.033 --> 02:12:28.315
grab his coat, and pull it off of him before
anyone seems to notice.

02:12:28.315 --> 02:12:31.775
TALIESIN: I want to see if he's got anything on
his belt like a pouch or anything like that.

02:12:31.775 --> 02:12:35.276
MATT: You glance, and there is a belt pouch
there.

02:12:35.276 --> 02:12:37.812
TALIESIN: I want to make a stab at grabbing and
ripping it off.

02:12:37.812 --> 02:12:38.961
ASHLY: Don't get greedy!

02:12:38.961 --> 02:12:40.366
MATT: Roll another sleight of hand check.

02:12:40.366 --> 02:12:42.179
IVAN: We're goblins; of course be greedy!

02:12:42.179 --> 02:12:43.322
TALIESIN: What am I rolling?

02:12:43.322 --> 02:12:44.463
MATT: This is another sleight of hand.

02:12:44.463 --> 02:12:45.436
TALIESIN: 15.

02:12:45.436 --> 02:12:50.882
MATT: 15. Okay! You snatch it and all of a sudden
you hear a voice from the front door go, "Hey,

02:12:50.882 --> 02:12:58.246
"what's that? I saw something! Is someone trying to
steal from Zed?!" You hear footsteps as somebody

02:12:58.246 --> 02:13:00.311
begins walking over to where he was right now.

02:13:00.311 --> 02:13:02.651
ASHLY: Go! We run?

02:13:02.651 --> 02:13:05.940
MATT: You guys run? Make stealth checks, guys.

02:13:05.940 --> 02:13:08.618
ASHLY: We have the coat, though, right?

02:13:08.618 --> 02:13:10.176
MATT: You have the coat with you, yeah.

02:13:10.176 --> 02:13:11.680
ASHLY: Oh no!

02:13:11.680 --> 02:13:12.983
PHIL: 40.

02:13:12.983 --> 02:13:14.106
ASHLY: 15.

02:13:14.106 --> 02:13:18.473
TALIESIN: 34.

02:13:18.473 --> 02:13:23.313
MATT: Okay, you guys run. As you're running,
Piglet, you're running behind them hanging on the

02:13:23.313 --> 02:13:27.972
back of the coat and you slam your head at the
bottom of the table, putting a big old knot on it.

02:13:27.972 --> 02:13:33.090
It happens to be the table where the card game was
being played. All the cards go (crashing), all the

02:13:33.090 --> 02:13:38.645
coins scatter in the air. The guys go, "Whoa what
the hell is that?!" And they see as this coat

02:13:38.645 --> 02:13:46.242
scampers off into the kitchen on its own. You guys
hear voices go, "Did you see that?!" "It went in

02:13:46.242 --> 02:13:50.891
"the kitchen, come on!" You hear the sound of
chairs scooting as all of a sudden people are

02:13:50.891 --> 02:13:53.342
beginning to stand up and rush towards the kitchen
after you.

02:13:53.342 --> 02:13:57.472
TALIESIN: While we're running, I'm going to take my
jar of puke and pour it out on the ground behind

02:13:57.472 --> 02:13:59.023
us like a mud slick.

02:13:59.023 --> 02:14:01.115
ASHLY: I have puke, too!

02:14:01.115 --> 02:14:07.809
MATT: You're holding the knot on your head, you
pull the jar, pour it out, and spill this slick

02:14:07.809 --> 02:14:15.242
mass of goblin vomit and whatever else liquid you
put inside there. As you dart through the kitchen,

02:14:15.242 --> 02:14:23.501
the cook goes, "Your food's ready! What the--?!"
And sees you guys dart out the door as the crowd

02:14:23.501 --> 02:14:33.367
comes in and two of them (yell) and fall on their
backs immediately there. A third man steps over

02:14:33.367 --> 02:14:39.056
and follows you into the alleyway. The cook's
like, "You can't be in here! What are you doing?!"

02:14:39.056 --> 02:14:43.607
As the door slams, you guys make your way into the
alley. You see the three of them rush out holding

02:14:43.607 --> 02:14:45.037
the coat.

02:14:45.037 --> 02:14:46.873
MARISHA: What's going on?

02:14:46.873 --> 02:14:50.158
(frantic yelling)

02:14:50.158 --> 02:14:56.878
MARISHA: I'm so glad I planned for this. And I go,
go guys. Smoke bomb!

02:14:56.878 --> 02:15:05.897
MATT: As the door opens again, you see this
breastplate-adorned guard of the city who is

02:15:05.897 --> 02:15:11.979
essentially the bouncer of this place, rushes out,
blade drawn, helmet half-cocked on his face where

02:15:11.979 --> 02:15:17.609
it doesn't fit right and one eye looks higher than
the other, and he goes, "You!" (explosion) As

02:15:17.609 --> 02:15:21.497
smoke fills this entire alleyway, he begins
coughing.

02:15:21.497 --> 02:15:25.759
MARISHA: Before the cloud gets too thick, I go--
and run.

02:15:25.759 --> 02:15:29.326
ASHLY: We should go in the outhouse and assemble
our Mary Kate and Ashley situation.

02:15:29.326 --> 02:15:30.541
MARISHA: Okay, let's do it!

02:15:30.541 --> 02:15:33.017
IVAN: We should probably not do it in the
outhouse.

02:15:33.017 --> 02:15:36.880
TALIESIN: We can run all the way around the
alleyway from this. Let's get down the alley.

02:15:36.880 --> 02:15:41.692
MATT: You guys rush out of the alleyway, you get
out of the fog, you manage to dart off to the side

02:15:41.692 --> 02:15:46.394
and wait a little bit. You hear that guard wander
off and start shouting, and vanishes in the

02:15:46.394 --> 02:15:49.432
distance. After a few moments of waiting, you're
pretty certain he hasn't been able to keep up with

02:15:49.432 --> 02:15:52.883
your trail because you're &lt;i&gt;that stealthy.&lt;/i&gt; Are you
going to do this?

02:15:52.883 --> 02:15:54.465
ASHLY: Yeah! Who wants to be the head?

02:15:54.465 --> 02:15:55.926
IVAN: That's the important one.

02:15:55.926 --> 02:15:58.671
PHIL: We all have goblin heads.

02:15:58.671 --> 02:16:01.478
IVAN: I have a 17 charisma.

02:16:01.478 --> 02:16:03.483
MARISHA: I don't like talking to people.

02:16:03.483 --> 02:16:06.187
ASHLY: Whoever has the highest charisma should
definitely be the head.

02:16:06.187 --> 02:16:08.177
IVAN: Grizznak the Great will be the head!

02:16:08.177 --> 02:16:11.490
MATT: This is the best goblin Voltron ever!

02:16:11.490 --> 02:16:18.605
IVAN: Hello, fellow human! Aren't you having a
wonderful human day today?

02:16:18.605 --> 02:16:21.161
PHIL: You guys have the high strength.

02:16:21.161 --> 02:16:26.297
TALIESIN: Well, we've got the high dex. You should
be the middle, so we'll be the legs.

02:16:26.297 --> 02:16:32.295
IVAN: You form the torso. I will form the head and
together we shall be Goblon!

02:16:32.295 --> 02:16:35.992
MARISHA: I've been doing a lot of crunches, so I
feel pretty good about being the core.

02:16:35.992 --> 02:16:37.342
TALIESIN: What's in the pouch?

02:16:37.342 --> 02:16:41.769
MATT: In the pouch you find eight gold pieces, a
small snuff box.

02:16:41.769 --> 02:16:44.929
TALIESIN: Ooh! I eat all the snuff.

02:16:44.929 --> 02:16:45.980
MATT: Okay!

02:16:45.980 --> 02:16:47.733
PHIL: You're flying!

02:16:47.733 --> 02:16:51.412
MARISHA: What did you eat?!

02:16:51.412 --> 02:16:54.766
MATT: Roll a will saving throw.

02:16:54.766 --> 02:17:00.483
TALIESIN: Where's my will saving throw? There it
is. 16.

02:17:00.483 --> 02:17:06.473
MATT: 16. Okay. The world gets a little funny for
a bit, and you feel exhilarated, though a little

02:17:06.473 --> 02:17:14.761
unfocused. What normally is the goblin ADHD is now
in hyperdrive. You're looking everywhere. We have

02:17:14.761 --> 02:17:16.516
Grizznak as the head.

02:17:16.516 --> 02:17:17.754
IVAN: Grizznak forms the head!

02:17:17.754 --> 02:17:18.946
PHIL: We are the middle.

02:17:18.946 --> 02:17:20.011
MATT: You guys are the middle.

02:17:20.011 --> 02:17:21.239
MARISHA and TALIESIN: We're the legs.

02:17:21.239 --> 02:17:25.492
MATT: With that, you stand up, coat goes on,
snapping it shut.

02:17:25.492 --> 02:17:28.634
ASHLY: I give Grizznak my pretty hat.

02:17:28.634 --> 02:17:35.277
IVAN: Okay. I actually have a goblin's wizard's
hat.

02:17:35.277 --> 02:17:38.443
ASHLY: Can you put it on top to humor me?

02:17:38.443 --> 02:17:43.376
IVAN: Why don't you put it under one of our arms
so it looks like we're carrying a helmet?

02:17:43.376 --> 02:17:45.248
ASHLY: All right. Fair enough.

02:17:45.248 --> 02:17:47.979
IVAN: I'll probably get away more with the wizard
hat.

02:17:47.979 --> 02:17:49.767
PHIL: Oh, you think?

02:17:49.767 --> 02:17:52.861
MATT: So, where are you guys going?

02:17:52.861 --> 02:17:58.652
PHIL: We're going towards where the people were
going. Was the alleyway

02:17:58.652 --> 02:18:00.402
parallel to the main street?

02:18:00.402 --> 02:18:02.299
MATT: It was, yeah. You follow that.

02:18:02.299 --> 02:18:03.578
PHIL: Head down the alleyway.

02:18:03.578 --> 02:18:06.119
MATT: Great. The sky has cleared, by the way.

02:18:06.119 --> 02:18:07.487
PHIL: Like Vincent D'onofrio.

02:18:07.487 --> 02:18:09.533
MARISHA: Yes, like Men in Black.

02:18:09.533 --> 02:18:17.512
MATT: Okay, so! (laughs) I'm so happy right now.

02:18:17.512 --> 02:18:20.231
IVAN: Hello!

02:18:20.231 --> 02:18:21.748
PHIL: Morning!

02:18:21.748 --> 02:18:28.738
MATT: As you guys trudge down the alleyway, the
sky is clear now. Most of the upper areas are dry

02:18:28.738 --> 02:18:32.195
other than a few rain barrels that have caught a
lot of water in the side of this alleyway. You can

02:18:32.195 --> 02:18:40.040
hear the music in the distance, you can hear the
laughter of children, you can hear people playing.

02:18:40.040 --> 02:18:46.419
It sounds like this festival is in heavy swing.
You come to the end of the alleyway into an open

02:18:46.419 --> 02:18:54.623
town square, a main open thoroughfare with large
tents that are erected, with large carts, people

02:18:54.623 --> 02:19:01.313
barking for food, different carnival games set up
throughout this area. What you notice amongst the

02:19:01.313 --> 02:19:10.426
buildings and houses is a large stone cathedral
that looms over this entire area. In front of this

02:19:10.426 --> 02:19:19.108
cathedral, there is a raised platform where the band
is playing, where the music's coming from. People

02:19:19.108 --> 02:19:26.374
all around this area are now talking and families
laughing. There are small poles that are erected

02:19:26.374 --> 02:19:29.209
that are covered in flower wreaths that are hung
around it.

02:19:29.209 --> 02:19:31.197
PHIL: Sounds gay.

02:19:31.197 --> 02:19:35.217
MATT: Actually, quite happy and jovial.

02:19:35.217 --> 02:19:44.140
IVAN: Never been so disgusted in my entire life. I
poke my legs and my torso to move them forward so

02:19:44.140 --> 02:19:48.976
that we can get closer to the stone. Does it look
like there's a speech

02:19:48.976 --> 02:19:50.525
that's going to be starting soon?

02:19:50.525 --> 02:19:52.628
MATT: People are gathered towards the center of
this area around that.

02:19:52.628 --> 02:20:01.233
IVAN: I would like to motion my torso and my legs
to be on the outer edge of the front couple of

02:20:01.233 --> 02:20:03.055
lines of the group.

02:20:03.055 --> 02:20:04.070
MATT: Okay.

02:20:04.070 --> 02:20:06.296
PHIL: Look and see if there's anybody wearing
blue.

02:20:06.296 --> 02:20:08.254
ASHLY: Yeah, look for the blue poop.

02:20:08.254 --> 02:20:14.595
IVAN: Blue. I see silver. I see brown, which is
nice. I see red. I see--

02:20:14.595 --> 02:20:16.173
ASHLY: What about blue? I don't care about the
other colors!

02:20:16.173 --> 02:20:17.775
IVAN: I see purple. You mean yellow?

02:20:17.775 --> 02:20:18.991
ASHLY: No! Blue!

02:20:18.991 --> 02:20:20.672
PHIL: Look for the guy in the blue!

02:20:20.672 --> 02:20:22.336
IVAN: I see a blue sky!

02:20:22.336 --> 02:20:29.035
MATT: As this is happening, a drunk man,
30-something, a red chin-strap beard, and long

02:20:29.035 --> 02:20:36.010
hair pulled into a top knot has a tankard in front
of him and, (hiccup) "Hey, happy Autumn's-thing."

02:20:36.010 --> 02:20:39.286
IVAN: Happy Autumn's-thing!

02:20:39.286 --> 02:20:41.004
MATT: Make a bluff check.

02:20:41.004 --> 02:20:44.934
IVAN: Oh, I'm so good at bluff. 15.

02:20:44.934 --> 02:20:49.681
MATT: He goes, "I think you need some more of this
than I do."

02:20:49.681 --> 02:20:52.216
IVAN: Yeah, I do!

02:20:52.216 --> 02:20:54.316
MATT: He pats you on the back with a hefty arm.

02:20:54.316 --> 02:20:56.874
MARISHA: Whoa!

02:20:56.874 --> 02:21:02.600
MATT: Since you are the guys that are holding the
legs right now, I need you to both

02:21:02.600 --> 02:21:04.015
make strength checks.

02:21:04.015 --> 02:21:05.486
TALIESIN: Oh god!

02:21:05.486 --> 02:21:06.722
ASHLY: 20.

02:21:06.722 --> 02:21:08.100
TALIESIN: Five.

02:21:08.100 --> 02:21:13.647
MATT: Five. One leg, whoa, goes forward, and you
stumble and take a knee like you're kneeling in

02:21:13.647 --> 02:21:16.603
the middle of the street. And the man who holds
the drink goes--

02:21:16.603 --> 02:21:18.577
ASHLY: Kids, I want to talk to you about safe sex.

02:21:18.577 --> 02:21:26.819
IVAN: I am reflecting upon the glory that is this
most holy day--

02:21:26.819 --> 02:21:28.483
PHIL: Stop talking!

02:21:28.483 --> 02:21:34.434
MATT: "Oh, you're one of them church types. Never
mind." And the guy stumbles off. At this point,

02:21:34.434 --> 02:21:36.862
you see the crowd starting to hush a little and
gather towards--

02:21:36.862 --> 02:21:38.780
TALIESIN: Hup!

02:21:38.780 --> 02:21:42.577
MATT: You get back up. Make a perception check if
you could, Grizznak.

02:21:42.577 --> 02:21:46.627
IVAN: Okay, that was very close. 17.

02:21:46.627 --> 02:21:49.427
MATT: 17. Glancing up, you can see now--

02:21:49.427 --> 02:21:54.163
IVAN: I try not to put my little hand up. I put it
back down.

02:21:54.163 --> 02:22:01.085
MATT: The people that are gathering towards this
central platform area you can see a person

02:22:01.085 --> 02:22:06.386
ascending the steps on the side. What you see is a
man dressed in simple, but elegant blue robes that

02:22:06.386 --> 02:22:10.906
walks from the cathedral, who is standing now at a
podium in the center of this. As people begin to

02:22:10.906 --> 02:22:18.377
hush, some yell towards him. He has short brown
hair and a well-kept beard that show a social

02:22:18.377 --> 02:22:24.379
station amongst the townspeople, although his
demeanor is very humble. But some people are

02:22:24.379 --> 02:22:28.115
paying attention to him, some people are looking
around, some people are still yelling and playing

02:22:28.115 --> 02:22:30.787
games. He seems to be a little frustrated that no
one's paying attention.

02:22:30.787 --> 02:22:33.672
IVAN: Blue alert! Blue alert! We have a code blue!

02:22:33.672 --> 02:22:34.873
TALIESIN: Running towards it.

02:22:34.873 --> 02:22:37.286
PHIL: Does he have a stone?

02:22:37.286 --> 02:22:38.818
IVAN: Can I see the stone at all?

02:22:38.818 --> 02:22:43.274
MATT: You do not see a stone. However, as you guys
begin to make your way through the crowd, and

02:22:43.274 --> 02:22:46.840
everyone's paying attention to various things in
the area, he reaches into the pocket of his robe

02:22:46.840 --> 02:22:57.480
and pulls out a small cast iron pellet about that
large. And he takes it, looks around, and throws

02:22:57.480 --> 02:23:06.695
it to the top of this platform. As it hits the
woodwork, you hear a sudden (thunderclap). It

02:23:06.695 --> 02:23:11.152
causes this echo of thunder throughout the
entirety of this area and everyone stops and goes

02:23:11.152 --> 02:23:12.245
(gasp).

02:23:12.245 --> 02:23:13.445
IVAN: He's got a boom cube.

02:23:13.445 --> 02:23:14.593
MARISHA: He's got a boom-boom rock.

02:23:14.593 --> 02:23:16.657
ASHLY: Is that the rock we want?

02:23:16.657 --> 02:23:18.230
IVAN: No, it's not the rock, but I like that rock.

02:23:18.230 --> 02:23:19.459
PHIL: That's the rock we want!

02:23:19.459 --> 02:23:24.159
IVAN: No, it's not, it's just a boom-boom rock.
Guys! You've seen boom-boom rocks. We all know

02:23:24.159 --> 02:23:25.387
about boom-boom rocks.

02:23:25.387 --> 02:23:26.700
PHIL: Have we seen these before?

02:23:26.700 --> 02:23:28.033
MATT: You have not.

02:23:28.033 --> 02:23:33.650
IVAN: Okay, well, Grizznak likes to &lt;i&gt;think&lt;/i&gt; he's
seen a boom-boom rock before because he's the

02:23:33.650 --> 02:23:36.050
smartest and the greatest Grizznak.

02:23:36.050 --> 02:23:38.512
ASHLY: Is there a way to confirm whether or not
that's the rock that--?

02:23:38.512 --> 02:23:42.780
MATT: Actually, for you, go ahead and roll a
wisdom check.

02:23:42.780 --> 02:23:44.523
IVAN: Oh, hohohoho.

02:23:44.523 --> 02:23:46.427
PHIL: O Grizznak the Barely Alive.

02:23:46.427 --> 02:23:48.395
IVAN: 21.

02:23:48.395 --> 02:23:51.807
MATT: You realize at this moment, as you were
instructing the goblins that can't possibly

02:23:51.807 --> 02:23:59.316
be the stone because that's a boom-boom rock, you
realize, holy shit, this entire journey was to

02:23:59.316 --> 02:24:01.108
retrieve a boom-boom rock.

02:24:01.108 --> 02:24:10.155
IVAN: Guys, Guffeye wants us to get boom-boom
rocks.

02:24:10.155 --> 02:24:13.315
ASHLY: Why does she want us to get boom-boom
rocks?

02:24:13.315 --> 02:24:15.046
IVAN: Because they're boom-boom rocks!

02:24:15.046 --> 02:24:17.211
ASHLY: But we have boom-boom rocks back home!

02:24:17.211 --> 02:24:22.030
MATT: With this, suddenly, you hear screams. You
hear dogs starting to bark in the distance and you

02:24:22.030 --> 02:24:26.972
see the glow of flames over across the way as two
streets, three streets away, you see fire

02:24:26.972 --> 02:24:29.227
beginning to glow and plumes of smoke build up.

02:24:29.227 --> 02:24:30.344
MARISHA: Fire!

02:24:30.344 --> 02:24:33.784
MATT: People begin to run, and chaos breaks in the
crowd as people begin looking about, screaming,

02:24:33.784 --> 02:24:36.800
"What's going on?! We're under attack! Goblins are
here!"

02:24:36.800 --> 02:24:45.955
IVAN: Okay, so Goblon is going to lurch forward,
and I'm going to try and see-- does he have like a

02:24:45.955 --> 02:24:48.283
pouch of boom-boom rocks? Or anything like that?

02:24:48.283 --> 02:24:53.358
MATT: No, all you see is the single stone rolling
off the top of the stage--

02:24:53.358 --> 02:24:54.607
IVAN: Mage Hand.

02:24:54.607 --> 02:24:59.017
MATT: Okay, you Mage Hand and the stone stops
there in place as you begin walking towards it.

02:24:59.017 --> 02:25:04.441
The crowd now is scattering and running away as
people are trying to flee from this distant flame.

02:25:04.441 --> 02:25:10.001
You hear another explosion in the distance as a
section of burning wood flips.

02:25:10.001 --> 02:25:15.774
MARISHA: Someone's making really &lt;i&gt;big&lt;/i&gt; boom-booms.
I want to meet &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; person!

02:25:15.774 --> 02:25:19.265
PHIL: Do you think that had anything to do with
the fire you set?

02:25:19.265 --> 02:25:21.883
IVAN: I don't think it's the fire that I set in
the tavern.

02:25:21.883 --> 02:25:25.805
ASHLY: Wait, guys, remember? There's other goblins
here.

02:25:25.805 --> 02:25:28.682
IVAN: Remember, it's the Seven-Teeth--

02:25:28.682 --> 02:25:30.205
PHIL: We've got to get the rock!

02:25:30.205 --> 02:25:32.057
TALIESIN: Too many tooth! Get the rock.

02:25:32.057 --> 02:25:35.288
PHIL: Wait, I'll ask you. Is anyone watching us?

02:25:35.288 --> 02:25:40.017
IVAN: I think everyone's pretty distracted by the
big boom-booms.

02:25:40.017 --> 02:25:44.638
MARISHA: Here, I can help clear this area out,
too. I light another little firecracker and throw

02:25:44.638 --> 02:25:47.562
it down next to us to scare the crowd.

02:25:47.562 --> 02:25:51.446
MATT: Okay, so as you throw another firecracker,
you guys stumble forward, foot by foot. I want you

02:25:51.446 --> 02:25:57.184
to make another bluff check. And I want both the
legs, both of you guys to make another strength

02:25:57.184 --> 02:25:58.937
check to try and get there quickly.

02:25:58.937 --> 02:26:01.614
IVAN: Natural 20. That puts me up to 27.

02:26:01.614 --> 02:26:02.734
MATT: Okay.

02:26:02.734 --> 02:26:04.411
ASHLY: Nine.

02:26:04.411 --> 02:26:05.414
TALIESIN: Ten.

02:26:05.414 --> 02:26:11.469
MATT: Okay, so: as you're rushing forward you can
see the crowd look at you as you turn and be like,

02:26:11.469 --> 02:26:16.174
"No! Don't go that way! The goblins are that way!"
And they're actually genuinely trying to save you.

02:26:16.174 --> 02:26:19.019
IVAN: I will save us from this goblin scum!

02:26:19.019 --> 02:26:23.954
MATT: And as you say that, the firecracker goes
off behind. Everyone looks around distracted, as

02:26:23.954 --> 02:26:31.899
both of your legs tumble forward and you tumble
forward. The coat unravels as what was once a

02:26:31.899 --> 02:26:36.129
single entity rolls into five goblin balls that
all (rolling thumps) across the stonework,

02:26:36.129 --> 02:26:43.237
slamming into the base of this platform. You guys
can hear the distant screams of goblins two or

02:26:43.237 --> 02:26:46.022
three streets over where the main battle's
happening. The guards have moved in that

02:26:46.022 --> 02:26:53.347
direction. This open thoroughfare is mostly empty
of all people at this time. You glance over and

02:26:53.347 --> 02:26:58.395
can see the stone is in the center of a light
piece of mud that hasn't fully dried from the

02:26:58.395 --> 02:26:59.303
earlier storm.

02:26:59.303 --> 02:27:00.441
PHIL: I go to get the stone.

02:27:00.441 --> 02:27:07.022
MATT: You rush forward, grab the stone, and put it
in your hand. You hear a voice say, "Halt! You

02:27:07.022 --> 02:27:13.235
"will walk no further, foul creature! Sarenrae's
vengeance will end your existence." You all glance

02:27:13.235 --> 02:27:17.680
over to the left of you and you see a woman
dressed in gold armor and light blue cloth

02:27:17.680 --> 02:27:22.660
clutching a scimitar in one hand and a small gold
statue of a winged woman in the other. As she

02:27:22.660 --> 02:27:27.138
glares at you, you hear a voice behind her say,
"Come on, Kyra, don't think we'll let you

02:27:27.138 --> 02:27:32.550
"have all the fun to yourself." You see, walking up
behind her, a small halfling man grinning with

02:27:32.550 --> 02:27:39.348
shaggy blond hair saunters up, pulling out a
flute. Behind him, a human in heavy armor, his

02:27:39.348 --> 02:27:45.855
long brown, unkempt hair around his shoulders
draws two blades and scowls. "Goblins, of course."

02:27:45.855 --> 02:27:53.043
He readies himself as a shield appears before him
as another heavily armored figure steps in front

02:27:53.043 --> 02:27:58.133
of the lot. A tall woman wielding a longsword, her
hair pulled back tight and her face tense goes,

02:27:58.133 --> 02:28:04.263
"Behind me. We shall smite them where they stand."
Behind all of them, you see an older man with long

02:28:04.263 --> 02:28:09.985
white hair and a beard hold up a staff and smirk.
"Well, Seelah, I can just destroy them from here.

02:28:09.985 --> 02:28:13.520
"That's fine with me." I need you all to roll
initiative.

02:28:13.520 --> 02:28:14.698
TALIESIN: Oh, shit.

02:28:14.698 --> 02:28:16.130
IVAN: Adventuring party.

02:28:16.130 --> 02:28:17.919
MARISHA: Damn adventuring parties.

02:28:17.919 --> 02:28:20.617
ASHLY: 21.

02:28:20.617 --> 02:28:21.893
MARISHA: 22.

02:28:21.893 --> 02:28:23.681
IVAN: Look at all this adventure.

02:28:23.681 --> 02:28:25.251
TALIESIN: Five.

02:28:25.251 --> 02:28:26.419
IVAN: I'm at an eight.

02:28:26.419 --> 02:28:27.519
PHIL: 24.

02:28:27.519 --> 02:28:29.302
MATT: All right, hold on just a second.

02:28:29.302 --> 02:28:31.341
ASHLY: There's no fleeing in D&amp;amp;D is there?

02:28:31.341 --> 02:28:33.086
MARISHA: Yeah, you can flee.

02:28:33.086 --> 02:28:34.449
PHIL: Oh, watch!

02:28:34.449 --> 02:28:37.607
TALIESIN: You can do anything you like.

02:28:37.607 --> 02:28:39.758
IVAN: If you've never seen goblins run before--

02:28:39.758 --> 02:28:42.534
PHIL: You're going to see some hellacious fleeing
right now.

02:28:42.534 --> 02:28:43.851
MARISHA: I'm not above it.

02:28:43.851 --> 02:28:54.564
PHIL: Because there's a lot of them with armor and
winged statuary!

02:28:54.564 --> 02:29:00.881
MARISHA: They got lots of hair. We've got really
big ears, though.

02:29:00.881 --> 02:29:04.519
MATT: 20? Higher than 20, anybody?

02:29:04.519 --> 02:29:05.659
PHIL: 24.

02:29:05.659 --> 02:29:06.673
ASHLY: 21.

02:29:06.673 --> 02:29:07.520
MARISHA: 22.

02:29:07.520 --> 02:29:09.528
MATT: Damn, look at that! All right.

02:29:09.528 --> 02:29:14.475
IVAN: Super runaway!

02:29:14.475 --> 02:29:18.847
MATT: That's Browntooth. You had--

02:29:18.847 --> 02:29:20.230
ASHLY: 21.

02:29:20.230 --> 02:29:21.282
MARISHA: 22.

02:29:21.282 --> 02:29:23.110
TALIESIN: We've got the rock?

02:29:23.110 --> 02:29:24.281
PHIL: I've got the rock.

02:29:24.281 --> 02:29:27.415
IVAN: Glad that we were able to keep it.

02:29:27.415 --> 02:29:29.708
PHIL: So far.

02:29:29.708 --> 02:29:36.325
MATT: These humans look ready and eager, and
there's a part of you that's like, "Oh man, it

02:29:36.325 --> 02:29:39.304
"would feel good to cut them down." It is up to you
what you want to do.

02:29:39.304 --> 02:29:41.966
PHIL: How many of them are there?

02:29:41.966 --> 02:29:43.081
TALIESIN: Four.

02:29:43.081 --> 02:29:46.442
IVAN: Four against five. Those are good goblin
numbers.

02:29:46.442 --> 02:29:47.745
ASHLY: There's five of them.

02:29:47.745 --> 02:29:54.395
IVAN: Oh, there's five of them? There's five of
us. That's bad goblin numbers. That's very bad

02:29:54.395 --> 02:29:55.789
goblin numbers.

02:29:55.789 --> 02:30:01.924
MATT: 20 to 15, anybody?

02:30:01.924 --> 02:30:03.837
IVAN: Ten to 15?

02:30:03.837 --> 02:30:06.470
MATT: Sorry, 20 to 15. Nope? All right.

02:30:06.470 --> 02:30:14.810
ASHLY: I'm all for smashing stuff, but I smashed a
wall, I smashed a crate. I'm down to run.

02:30:14.810 --> 02:30:16.349
MATT: 15 to ten?

02:30:16.349 --> 02:30:19.121
IVAN: 15 to ten, no.

02:30:19.121 --> 02:30:22.746
MATT: Nope. Ten to five?

02:30:22.746 --> 02:30:23.949
IVAN: Eight.

02:30:23.949 --> 02:30:25.269
TALIESIN: Five.

02:30:25.269 --> 02:30:33.028
TALIESIN: I like the random sounds of sheep being
tortured.

02:30:33.028 --> 02:30:35.829
MARISHA: (sheep bleating)

02:30:35.829 --> 02:30:39.041
TALIESIN: Thursday night. It's a nice Sunday night
right there.

02:30:39.041 --> 02:30:46.455
MATT: Top of the round. All of them charge into
the square as the rest scattered. Bring this in

02:30:46.455 --> 02:30:51.451
here. Browntooth, you're up first.

02:30:51.451 --> 02:30:58.814
PHIL: I look for some place to hide and head there
as quickly as possible.

02:30:58.814 --> 02:31:05.533
MATT: Closest place to hide here would be behind this
cart or behind the platform.

02:31:05.533 --> 02:31:08.715
PHIL: Where are the attacking people?

02:31:08.715 --> 02:31:10.435
MATT: They're right here.

02:31:10.435 --> 02:31:20.094
PHIL: Ah! There they are. I get behind the
platform.

02:31:20.094 --> 02:31:28.073
MATT: You duck around here. Go ahead and roll a
stealth check to hide in the shadows.

02:31:28.073 --> 02:31:31.514
PHIL: 30.

02:31:31.514 --> 02:31:33.354
MATT: 13?

02:31:33.354 --> 02:31:34.496
PHIL: 30.

02:31:34.496 --> 02:31:38.177
MATT: 30! Okay! You duck underneath the platform,
keeping an eye on what's happening.

02:31:38.177 --> 02:31:39.757
Is that your turn?

02:31:39.757 --> 02:31:40.846
PHIL: Can I see them?

02:31:40.846 --> 02:31:41.830
MATT: You can see them.

02:31:41.830 --> 02:31:45.356
PHIL: Yes, that's my turn.

02:31:45.356 --> 02:31:47.522
MATT: Snizzler, it's your turn.

02:31:47.522 --> 02:31:55.478
MARISHA: First, I'm going to take a pipe bomb and
throw it right at that one.

02:31:55.478 --> 02:32:01.995
MATT: Right there? All right. He is 25 feet away.
Do you want to get a little closer to do it?

02:32:01.995 --> 02:32:05.835
MARISHA: I move up one square and then I hit him.

02:32:05.835 --> 02:32:08.330
MATT: Lob it! Roll for an attack.

02:32:08.330 --> 02:32:12.104
IVAN: Goblin pipe bombs!

02:32:12.104 --> 02:32:13.351
MARISHA: 18!

02:32:13.351 --> 02:32:14.888
MATT: 18 hits!

02:32:14.888 --> 02:32:16.398
ASHLY: Nice!

02:32:16.398 --> 02:32:19.012
MATT: It is a touch attack, correct?

02:32:19.012 --> 02:32:20.328
MARISHA: Touch attack.

02:32:20.328 --> 02:32:23.343
MATT: He's actually on fire right now.

02:32:23.343 --> 02:32:28.447
MARISHA: Everyone in a ten foot radius must make a
reflex save.

02:32:28.447 --> 02:32:30.439
MATT: Indeed. What's the DC on that?

02:32:30.439 --> 02:32:32.036
MARISHA: 14.

02:32:32.036 --> 02:32:47.927
MATT: That is a failure, success, success. Three
damage, three damage, and six damage. Nice!

02:32:47.927 --> 02:32:56.832
MARISHA: Plus the main dude takes 13 damage.

02:32:56.832 --> 02:33:00.447
MATT: 13 points of damage! Woo!

02:33:00.447 --> 02:33:06.661
MARISHA: Can I use the rest of my movement to also
run backwards?

02:33:06.661 --> 02:33:10.277
MATT: Sure.

02:33:10.277 --> 02:33:13.041
MARISHA: Run towards these things.

02:33:13.041 --> 02:33:15.681
MATT: That's about as far as you can get right
there.

02:33:15.681 --> 02:33:16.954
MARISHA: That's fine.

02:33:16.954 --> 02:33:23.212
MATT: You run up, fling it, and dart away, as it
lands at the foot of the guy with the blades out,

02:33:23.212 --> 02:33:28.376
he prepares himself and goes to guard as it
(explosion) bursts in front of him. You can see

02:33:28.376 --> 02:33:32.753
the flames coast up and now the fire is caught
into his hair and his armor is burning from

02:33:32.753 --> 02:33:38.507
whatever goblin liquid, napalm-like material you
had in there adhered to him. As the fire bursts

02:33:38.507 --> 02:33:42.488
outward in a ten foot radius because of your
goblin expertise with explosive devices, the

02:33:42.488 --> 02:33:48.327
flames catch the three other allies of his, who
all manage to avoid most of the impact. But you

02:33:48.327 --> 02:33:52.823
do see them scarred and burned a little bit from
the side of the blast. The fighter is furious as

02:33:52.823 --> 02:33:55.943
the flames lick across his torso. That ends your
turn. Piglet, you're up.

02:33:55.943 --> 02:34:03.245
ASHLY: Well, you lit them on fire, so now I want
to smash them. But maybe I should run away.

02:34:03.245 --> 02:34:04.764
TALIESIN: Follow your heart.

02:34:04.764 --> 02:34:07.017
PHIL: Ranged attack? No.

02:34:07.017 --> 02:34:08.412
ASHLY: I don't have a ranged attack.

02:34:08.412 --> 02:34:10.495
MATT: You are an up-close and angry--

02:34:10.495 --> 02:34:12.108
ASHLY: Screw it, I'm going to rage!

02:34:12.108 --> 02:34:14.654
MATT: Yes!

02:34:14.654 --> 02:34:17.490
ASHLY: So I rage.

02:34:17.490 --> 02:34:23.142
MATT: You rage. You can move 40 feet because
you're a barbarian, so you can go pretty far.

02:34:23.142 --> 02:34:24.378
Where do you want to go?

02:34:24.378 --> 02:34:30.514
ASHLY: How up-close and personal can I get? What
dude did Marisha just hit real hard?

02:34:30.514 --> 02:34:31.642
MATT: That guy.

02:34:31.642 --> 02:34:33.180
ASHLY: How close can I get to him?

02:34:33.180 --> 02:34:34.240
MATT: You can get right up to him.

02:34:34.240 --> 02:34:35.366
ASHLY: Let's get right up to that guy.

02:34:35.366 --> 02:34:41.849
MATT: You (yells) rush up, hammer in the air. You
get one hammer attack on this turn.

02:34:41.849 --> 02:34:45.525
ASHLY: 17.

02:34:45.525 --> 02:34:50.812
MATT: 17 just hits! His armor class is 17. Go
ahead and roll damage on that.

02:34:50.812 --> 02:34:52.792
ASHLY: This is my d10, right?

02:34:52.792 --> 02:34:53.991
MATT: Yep, d10.

02:34:53.991 --> 02:34:58.276
ASHLY: Seven plus six is 13.

02:34:58.276 --> 02:35:04.206
MATT: 13 points of damage. As you rush up to the
man that's on fire, you leap into the air (yells)

02:35:04.206 --> 02:35:09.375
and plant your goblin Skullbreaker Hammer right
square in the chest. You can see his armor bend

02:35:09.375 --> 02:35:15.247
inward and he goes (gasping) as the air escapes
with a spatter of blood that crosses your face.

02:35:15.247 --> 02:35:20.504
It's warm and you take it in. As you pull back the
hammer, the flames still burning on him. He's

02:35:20.504 --> 02:35:25.632
coughing up blood now from the impact. He's
already taken a very poor round.

02:35:25.632 --> 02:35:29.271
That ends your turn?

02:35:29.271 --> 02:35:30.643
ASHLY: Mm-hmm.

02:35:30.643 --> 02:35:40.214
MATT: Angry Piglet's up front. First and foremost,
the little halfling bard shouts out to the rest of

02:35:40.214 --> 02:35:47.145
the group, "Valeros, you okay, bud? All right,
let's do this. Great!" And he jumps up onto this

02:35:47.145 --> 02:35:54.002
cart right here and pulls out his flute and begins
singing, "And as their footfalls to the ground,

02:35:54.002 --> 02:35:58.867
"the strength and mighty muscles bound! They raise
their blades into the sky and cut those goblins

02:35:58.867 --> 02:36:04.824
"nigh and high!" As he begins to sing, he bolsters
all his allies in song. You see all of them begin

02:36:04.824 --> 02:36:11.560
to rally themselves for the battle, hearing their
friend accompanying this rousing fight. That

02:36:11.560 --> 02:36:15.191
finishes his turn. They all have bonuses to their
combat prowess.

02:36:15.191 --> 02:36:16.535
PHIL: That's bullshit.

02:36:16.535 --> 02:36:24.724
MATT: The paladin, who watched her friend get
pummeled in the chest and set aflame, goes, "Not

02:36:24.724 --> 02:36:29.272
"on my watch!" and steps in to you and is going to
take a swing with her longsword.

02:36:29.272 --> 02:36:31.724
PHIL: Paladin who worships cliches, apparently.

02:36:31.724 --> 02:36:34.296
MATT: Would you consider yourself an evil
character?

02:36:34.296 --> 02:36:40.301
ASHLY: I'm just trying to get mine, you know what
I mean? Probably, yeah.

02:36:40.301 --> 02:36:48.676
MATT: She's going to attempt to Smite Evil as her
swift action. That's a natural 20. I have to

02:36:48.676 --> 02:36:53.506
confirm to see if it crits. That is a 17. What's
your armor class?

02:36:53.506 --> 02:36:54.920
ASHLY: 19.

02:36:54.920 --> 02:37:01.356
MATT: 19, it does not confirm crit! However, you
do suffer--

02:37:01.356 --> 02:37:12.316
ASHLY: Piglet's going to go down swinging, guys.

02:37:12.316 --> 02:37:18.023
MATT: That's eight points of slashing damage as
the blade strikes into you and a burst of divine

02:37:18.023 --> 02:37:24.667
energy as you feel your dark core of your
blackened goblin heart all of a sudden burn with

02:37:24.667 --> 02:37:28.739
radiant, divine energy. That ends her turn.

02:37:28.739 --> 02:37:32.116
PHIL: Fucking born agains.

02:37:32.116 --> 02:37:41.259
MATT: Next up, this older wizard dude is going to
look to the one who threw the bomb and goes,

02:37:41.259 --> 02:37:44.706
(casting) and holds aloft his staff.

02:37:44.706 --> 02:37:50.101
MARISHA: What? I don't understand you! Speak
English!

02:37:50.101 --> 02:37:55.833
MATT: You put out your giant goblin ear to listen
to the strange language. A pock of greenish energy

02:37:55.833 --> 02:37:59.506
forms in the air as an arrow streaks towards you.

02:37:59.506 --> 02:38:04.424
MARISHA: Foul play, man, foul play. Thought you
were trying to tell me something.

02:38:04.424 --> 02:38:06.081
MATT: What's your armor class?

02:38:06.081 --> 02:38:07.629
MARISHA: 17.

02:38:07.629 --> 02:38:16.699
MATT: 17. Okay! As this arcane arrow full of acid
streaks towards you, you do a goblin cartwheel out

02:38:16.699 --> 02:38:23.811
of the way and it hits a barrel behind you. It
begins to melt the barrel and you can see a thick

02:38:23.811 --> 02:38:30.963
series of berries begin to spill out onto the
thoroughfare. He goes, "Oh, damn it!" He ducks

02:38:30.963 --> 02:38:40.832
into this alleyway between those buildings here.
That ends his turn. The cleric, now, is going to

02:38:40.832 --> 02:38:51.515
step up to the center, holds her scimitar in one hand
and her holy symbol to the sky and goes,

02:38:51.515 --> 02:39:04.751
"Sarenrae, protect us!" Energy drifts off. All of
her allies heal up six hit points.

02:39:04.751 --> 02:39:06.692
PHIL: All right, I'm going to kill her.

02:39:06.692 --> 02:39:12.344
MATT: You also heal six hit points because you are
a living creature and you're in the radius, so you

02:39:12.344 --> 02:39:15.985
heal six. Unintended consequence of her
circumstance.

02:39:15.985 --> 02:39:20.190
IVAN: Because her god considers you collateral.

02:39:20.190 --> 02:39:23.213
ASHLY: Her god's like, "I like this one!"

02:39:23.213 --> 02:39:24.866
IVAN: I like this one's spunk!

02:39:24.866 --> 02:39:26.548
ASHLY: This one's got the moxie!

02:39:26.548 --> 02:39:30.775
MATT: The fighter who's on fire is going to grin
and bear the flames because he wants to take down

02:39:30.775 --> 02:39:33.543
the one who smashed him with the hammer. He's
going to take another 1d6 fire damage; go ahead

02:39:33.543 --> 02:39:35.280
and roll for that.

02:39:35.280 --> 02:39:36.727
MARISHA: Five.

02:39:36.727 --> 02:39:38.980
ASHLY: Nice!

02:39:38.980 --> 02:39:50.037
MATT: However, he is angrily going to unleash upon
you with his longsword and shortsword. That is 13

02:39:50.037 --> 02:39:52.278
to hit with his longsword. What's your armor
class?

02:39:52.278 --> 02:39:53.305
ASHLY: 19.

02:39:53.305 --> 02:39:57.651
MATT: You duck out of the way. He goes in to stick
you with a shortsword. That's an 18.

02:39:57.651 --> 02:40:00.228
ASHLY: 19. Yes!

02:40:00.228 --> 02:40:02.089
TALIESIN: We are hard to hit.

02:40:02.089 --> 02:40:03.612
ASHLY: (yelling) I'm going to live forever!

02:40:03.612 --> 02:40:07.944
MATT: Can't seem to find you with his blades as he
angrily swings outward.

02:40:07.944 --> 02:40:10.220
IVAN: And by forever you mean 30.

02:40:10.220 --> 02:40:14.160
MATT: Grizznak, your turn.

02:40:14.160 --> 02:40:23.996
IVAN: Oh, crap. I think I'm going to give this a
shot. I'm going to try to get kitty-corner to

02:40:23.996 --> 02:40:32.300
where Piglet is, so five feet away, not within
threat range of the group.

02:40:32.300 --> 02:40:34.257
MATT: There?

02:40:34.257 --> 02:40:41.224
IVAN: Yeah, one more step towards me. Trying to
see if that's going to get Piglet in the way or

02:40:41.224 --> 02:40:46.218
not. It may. If I have the movement, I'll do one
more right next to it.

02:40:46.218 --> 02:40:47.945
MATT: Yeah, you have the movement.

02:40:47.945 --> 02:41:01.071
IVAN: I'm going to mock the wizard. I'm going to
look at him and go, (casting) (sneezes) And cast

02:41:01.071 --> 02:41:10.293
Flaming Sneeze. (sneezing) As gouts of flames
start coming out of my nose over and over again.

02:41:10.293 --> 02:41:12.437
MARISHA: Yeah, go Grizz!

02:41:12.437 --> 02:41:13.679
TALIESIN: Moldy grain, man. Not even once.

02:41:13.679 --> 02:41:24.698
IVAN: I know, I get really bad allergies to grain.
Moldy grain especially. (sneezes)

02:41:24.698 --> 02:41:28.462
MATT: I'm okay with this. What are the rolls you
have to make for that one?

02:41:28.462 --> 02:41:41.296
IVAN: I still have to make a concentration. Shit.
My DC on it is 13 and I got a ten. Song time!

02:41:41.296 --> 02:41:43.391
MARISHA: Song time!

02:41:43.391 --> 02:41:50.808
IVAN: Song time for my reroll in the midst of my
sneezing, because I'm not feeling like I'm tickled

02:41:50.808 --> 02:41:58.115
enough, I launch into my: (sings) Grizznak, Grizznak, the
greatest that there is! Smarter than the stupid

02:41:58.115 --> 02:42:04.515
ones, even when he whizzed. Look at them run, look at
them hide, look down to watch them burn and die!

02:42:04.515 --> 02:42:18.611
Zergamot will loot the corpse and then we'll take
a ride, hey! I'm going to reroll. I'm never

02:42:18.611 --> 02:42:20.755
allowed be a player ever again.

02:42:20.755 --> 02:42:25.496
MARISHA: Every time we've used our songs to reroll
it's gotten worse!

02:42:25.496 --> 02:42:28.463
MATT: What'd you roll? Are you kidding me?!

02:42:28.463 --> 02:42:30.767
ASHLY: Oh no!

02:42:30.767 --> 02:42:35.252
IVAN: I will allow you to light myself on fire
with my own sneezes.

02:42:35.252 --> 02:42:38.679
MATT: That's what happens!

02:42:38.679 --> 02:42:41.259
TALIESIN: Do not sneeze into the wind!

02:42:41.259 --> 02:42:43.253
IVAN: (sneezes)

02:42:43.253 --> 02:42:46.763
MATT: Is it called Fire Sneeze or Flaming Sneeze?

02:42:46.763 --> 02:42:48.329
IVAN: It's called Fire Sneeze.

02:42:48.329 --> 02:42:54.751
MATT: Based on the effects of this spell, I need
you to--

02:42:54.751 --> 02:43:00.179
IVAN: For two rounds, I'm doing this continually.
I keep sneezing for two rounds.

02:43:00.179 --> 02:43:02.273
MATT: Roll a reflex save.

02:43:02.273 --> 02:43:03.654
IVAN: All right!

02:43:03.654 --> 02:43:05.404
MARISHA: Big money, no whammies!

02:43:05.404 --> 02:43:06.510
IVAN: Seven!

02:43:06.510 --> 02:43:14.408
MATT: Seven. Go ahead and roll 2d6 of fire damage
as you glance over at the wizard, wink, go to

02:43:14.408 --> 02:43:17.581
sneeze and suddenly you catch yourself, close the
mouth.

02:43:17.581 --> 02:43:29.456
IVAN: Grizznak Snopstork signs off, everybody, as
I consume myself in flames. And take ten damage.

02:43:29.456 --> 02:43:31.351
PHIL: &lt;i&gt;That's&lt;/i&gt; the good roll you get?

02:43:31.351 --> 02:43:32.490
IVAN: That's my good roll.

02:43:32.490 --> 02:43:34.051
TALIESIN: You sneeze yourself to death.

02:43:34.051 --> 02:43:43.566
MATT: As you sneeze, there is a ball of flame that
bursts out of the nostrils and ears of Grizznak.

02:43:43.566 --> 02:43:53.593
As smoke pours out, (yells) and falls onto the
back. (sizzling) Unconscious, but smoldering at

02:43:53.593 --> 02:43:54.978
the moment.

02:43:54.978 --> 02:43:57.094
MARISHA: Oh, shit! That was nuts!

02:43:57.094 --> 02:44:01.492
IVAN: Just to be clear, that puts me at negative
one.

02:44:01.492 --> 02:44:04.217
MATT: Negative one. Mezek, you're up.

02:44:04.217 --> 02:44:05.956
ASHLY: This is not going super hot, guys.

02:44:05.956 --> 02:44:08.113
PHIL: I told you to run!

02:44:08.113 --> 02:44:12.802
TALIESIN: The guy who's on fire, who's not doing
well, right?

02:44:12.802 --> 02:44:13.802
MATT: Yes.

02:44:13.802 --> 02:44:22.708
TALIESIN: I'm going to run screaming at him. I'm
going to (yells) throw one of my awful stars

02:44:22.708 --> 02:44:24.876
directly at him as I run straight up to him.

02:44:24.876 --> 02:44:28.591
PHIL: Why not run &lt;i&gt;away&lt;/i&gt; and throw the star? It's
a ranged weapon!

02:44:28.591 --> 02:44:31.839
MATT: Mid-run, you throw a star using your deadly
aim.

02:44:31.839 --> 02:44:44.359
TALIESIN: I am using my deadly aim. That can't
possibly go poorly. That's 18.

02:44:44.359 --> 02:44:48.118
MATT: 18 hits. Go ahead and roll damage with the
additional plus two damage for the deadly aim.

02:44:48.118 --> 02:44:51.981
TALIESIN: I don't have to roll damage, it's an
auto. That's six points of damage. (yells)

02:44:51.981 --> 02:45:01.814
MATT: As you rush up, you throw it, it embeds in
the side of his throat and he's like (coughing).

02:45:01.814 --> 02:45:04.908
He reaches up and pulls it out and a gout of
blood goes (spraying). He's like (grunting)

02:45:04.908 --> 02:45:11.350
holding his longsword in one hand. "Stupid
goblins!" As the flames are still burning around

02:45:11.350 --> 02:45:14.083
him. You move all the way up to him.

02:45:14.083 --> 02:45:16.114
TALIESIN: I'm straight up in their business.

02:45:16.114 --> 02:45:18.855
MATT: Ending your turn, we're back up to the top
of the round. Browntooth, you're up.

02:45:18.855 --> 02:45:20.315
IVAN: Drunken master.

02:45:20.315 --> 02:45:26.739
PHIL: Now, I like you guys, I really do.

02:45:26.739 --> 02:45:28.662
IVAN: But super run away?

02:45:28.662 --> 02:45:31.542
MATT: They have no idea you're hiding.

02:45:31.542 --> 02:45:34.115
MARISHA: You have the rock, don't you?

02:45:34.115 --> 02:45:35.313
PHIL: Yep!

02:45:35.313 --> 02:45:42.052
IVAN: Oh, that would be very goblin of you to just
leave everyone to die and be the one that brings the

02:45:42.052 --> 02:45:45.734
boom-boom rock back to Guffeye.

02:45:45.734 --> 02:45:52.917
PHIL: I would be her favorite. Especially if I
were the only one left! I might get a drink with

02:45:52.917 --> 02:46:08.552
dinner! But first, I am going to shoot my light
crossbow at the-- there's the flaming fellow--

02:46:08.552 --> 02:46:12.998
MATT: Right there. There's the paladin, and
there's the cleric there. That's the bard.

02:46:12.998 --> 02:46:18.847
PHIL: Should I finish off the big guy?

02:46:18.847 --> 02:46:20.553
TALIESIN: He's on fire.

02:46:20.553 --> 02:46:23.980
IVAN: He's got blood coming out the side of his
neck.

02:46:23.980 --> 02:46:26.451
PHIL: I could reach all of them.

02:46:26.451 --> 02:46:30.124
TALIESIN: Yeah, you can hit anybody you like.
There's a bard, a cleric--

02:46:30.124 --> 02:46:33.245
PHIL: The wizard has run off.

02:46:33.245 --> 02:46:34.560
TALIESIN: He's run off.

02:46:34.560 --> 02:46:37.680
ASHLY: You could try to finish off flame dude.

02:46:37.680 --> 02:46:40.228
MARISHA: Whereabouts are you, Browntooth?

02:46:40.228 --> 02:46:42.601
ASHLY: He's behind that platform over yonder.

02:46:42.601 --> 02:46:44.677
TALIESIN: Yeah, he's the yellow circle.

02:46:44.677 --> 02:46:49.642
PHIL: The cleric.

02:46:49.642 --> 02:46:52.783
MATT: Go ahead and roll for attack.

02:46:52.783 --> 02:46:56.883
ASHLY: Ooh! 17 plus nine.

02:46:56.883 --> 02:47:02.449
PHIL: 25.

02:47:02.449 --> 02:47:07.441
MATT: Yeah, that definitely hits. Go ahead and
roll damage with additional 2d6 sneak attack

02:47:07.441 --> 02:47:08.922
damage.

02:47:08.922 --> 02:47:12.121
PHIL: Should I do them all at once?

02:47:12.121 --> 02:47:14.357
TALIESIN: Yeah, do them all at once.

02:47:14.357 --> 02:47:17.317
PHIL: (grunts) Seven.

02:47:17.317 --> 02:47:27.402
MATT: Seven points of damage to the cleric. The
bolt strikes the back of the cleric's lower torso,

02:47:27.402 --> 02:47:32.157
the kidney area and she goes (grunts) and almost
drops the holy symbol, catching it in the middle

02:47:32.157 --> 02:47:38.941
of the air, looks around. Make a stealth check to
see if you manage to remain hidden this round.

02:47:38.941 --> 02:47:42.681
PHIL: 29. No, 26.

02:47:42.681 --> 02:47:49.409
MATT: 26. She glances around and doesn't know
where it came from and is like (grunts). Are you

02:47:49.409 --> 02:47:52.234
going to move, or are you going to stay where you
are?

02:47:52.234 --> 02:47:59.042
PHIL: Stay where I am. Stupid goblins. Run!
Leave!

02:47:59.042 --> 02:48:01.873
MATT: That ends your turn. Snizzler, you're up,
Piglet, you're on deck.

02:48:01.873 --> 02:48:09.079
MARISHA: Seeing where Browntooth is, I'm like,
he's got the right idea. I'm going to move up like

02:48:09.079 --> 02:48:19.634
to here. Over one. Yeah. Throw another bomb at the
cleric. Yeah.

02:48:19.634 --> 02:48:25.186
MATT: You lob it towards the cleric. Go ahead and
roll for an attack.

02:48:25.186 --> 02:48:32.210
MARISHA: Bombs! Boom boom! That's not good at
all!

02:48:32.210 --> 02:48:33.418
IVAN: It scatters!

02:48:33.418 --> 02:48:38.290
MARISHA: Oh, that's right, it does technically
scatter. I'm going to let it scatter.

02:48:38.290 --> 02:48:41.133
MATT: What'd you roll?

02:48:41.133 --> 02:48:44.083
MARISHA: I rolled a four plus eight, so 12.

02:48:44.083 --> 02:48:50.422
MATT: Yeah, 12, that's going to miss.

02:48:50.422 --> 02:48:56.292
IVAN: It lands right on Grizznak, on his
unconscious corpse.

02:48:56.292 --> 02:48:58.594
MATT: It's going to land right there.

02:48:58.594 --> 02:49:00.351
MARISHA: Oh, perfect!

02:49:00.351 --> 02:49:13.829
MATT: Minimum damage on that is six. I need a reflex
save from Piglet and from Mezek.

02:49:13.829 --> 02:49:17.305
All right, that's six damage to all of
them.

02:49:17.305 --> 02:49:18.948
ASHLY: It is 11.

02:49:18.948 --> 02:49:21.343
MATT: You take six fire damage.

02:49:21.343 --> 02:49:22.484
TALIESIN: 20.

02:49:22.484 --> 02:49:23.897
MATT: You take three points.

02:49:23.897 --> 02:49:25.256
TALIESIN: I take zero because I have evasion.

02:49:25.256 --> 02:49:30.934
MARISHA: Fire! I continue my movement towards
Browntooth.

02:49:30.934 --> 02:49:37.752
ASHLY: I might go down, but I'm going to go
down--

02:49:37.752 --> 02:49:40.788
TALIESIN: You're as close to a tank as a goblin
can be.

02:49:40.788 --> 02:49:42.122
ASHLY: That's true.

02:49:42.122 --> 02:49:45.259
MATT: Remember, your maximum hit points went up to
what your rage score is.

02:49:45.259 --> 02:49:50.253
ASHLY: Oh, that's right! 44?

02:49:50.253 --> 02:49:51.719
MATT: Whatever it says.

02:49:51.719 --> 02:49:52.865
ASHLY: Yeah, 44.

02:49:52.865 --> 02:49:55.444
MATT: As you're raging, your hit points are up
higher.

02:49:55.444 --> 02:49:57.982
ASHLY: That's right, so I'm not at 24 maximum hit
points.

02:49:57.982 --> 02:50:03.268
MATT: Keep that in mind. All right. That ends
Snizzler's turn. You're up.

02:50:03.268 --> 02:50:07.081
ASHLY: There's no way I can take my hammer and hit
multiple people? No?

02:50:07.081 --> 02:50:11.868
MATT: No, but because you're raging and you're in
base to base with them, you can attack and bite.

02:50:11.868 --> 02:50:17.364
ASHLY: Okay. I'm going to attack flame dude. With
my normal attack.

02:50:17.364 --> 02:50:19.967
MATT: Go ahead and roll with your normal attack.

02:50:19.967 --> 02:50:22.333
ASHLY: 20 naturally, plus nine.

02:50:22.333 --> 02:50:23.358
MATT: Natural 20?

02:50:23.358 --> 02:50:24.691
TALIESIN: Golden snitch, motherfuckers!

02:50:24.691 --> 02:50:27.085
MATT: Roll again to see if you can confirm
critical. Roll another d20.

02:50:27.085 --> 02:50:28.797
IVAN: Piglet MVP!

02:50:28.797 --> 02:50:30.482
ASHLY: 12 plus nine?

02:50:30.482 --> 02:50:34.779
MATT: Plus nine? That's a critical hit! What's the
damage multiplier on that?

02:50:34.779 --> 02:50:35.683
ASHLY: Huh?

02:50:35.683 --> 02:50:37.291
MATT: It should have a multiplier next to the
weapon.

02:50:37.291 --> 02:50:38.523
ASHLY: Times three.

02:50:38.523 --> 02:50:40.313
MATT: Roll 3d10.

02:50:40.313 --> 02:50:42.100
ASHLY: 3d10?!

02:50:42.100 --> 02:50:49.495
MATT: Yes, plus six. 3d10 plus six damage.

02:50:49.495 --> 02:50:53.122
PHIL: Are the zeroes tens?

02:50:53.122 --> 02:50:54.151
MATT: Yeah.

02:50:54.151 --> 02:50:58.743
ASHLY: Oh, zeroes are tens? 21 plus six. 26.

02:50:58.743 --> 02:51:03.405
MATT: How do you want to finish him off? Because
you destroy him. So, the man who's on fire in

02:51:03.405 --> 02:51:04.947
front of you with his two weapons out.

02:51:04.947 --> 02:51:06.363
PHIL: That's the one you hit?

02:51:06.363 --> 02:51:08.657
ASHLY: That's the guy. Damn it, I wish I had gone
for the other one.

02:51:08.657 --> 02:51:13.420
MATT: How do you want to finish him off? He's
(heavy breathing).

02:51:13.420 --> 02:51:20.767
ASHLY: I want to knock his head off with the
hammer and I want it to fall into the lap of his

02:51:20.767 --> 02:51:26.340
now grieving friend and spray blood all over them.
The most adjacent friend. No, the bard.

02:51:26.340 --> 02:51:27.167
I hate the bard.

02:51:27.167 --> 02:51:28.347
MATT: The bard?

02:51:28.347 --> 02:51:30.225
ASHLY: Hit the bard in the head with his friend's
head.

02:51:30.225 --> 02:51:36.795
MATT: You swing as the fighter goes to parry your
blow. Your goblin rage gets you a faster speed

02:51:36.795 --> 02:51:41.044
than he ever expected. As he goes to swing it to
the side, the hammer comes straight across from

02:51:41.044 --> 02:51:44.434
the direction he wasn't expecting, like an
unintentional feint. His eyes goes wide for a

02:51:44.434 --> 02:51:49.693
second before the hammer (slams) and the head gets
carried off of his shoulders. It spins backwards,

02:51:49.693 --> 02:51:56.039
and the bard, who's singing his song, looks up as
his friend's head towards him. Falls onto his feet and goes

02:51:56.039 --> 02:52:02.567
(yells). Makes a concentration. Fails his
concentration. I'll say the song ends, he has to

02:52:02.567 --> 02:52:10.569
start it again because he just saw his friend's
head land at his feet. He goes, "Valero? You!" You

02:52:10.569 --> 02:52:14.528
can see there is a genuine horror and sadness in
his face.

02:52:14.528 --> 02:52:16.100
ASHLY: I go: Yay!

02:52:16.100 --> 02:52:18.859
TALIESIN: You still have a bite attack!

02:52:18.859 --> 02:52:20.136
ASHLY: I still have a bite attack!

02:52:20.136 --> 02:52:21.198
MATT: Yes, you do!

02:52:21.198 --> 02:52:22.459
ASHLY: Who's by him?

02:52:22.459 --> 02:52:24.797
MATT: This is the paladin right here.

02:52:24.797 --> 02:52:25.948
ASHLY: I'll bite the paladin.

02:52:25.948 --> 02:52:28.693
MATT: Go for it. Roll for attack.

02:52:28.693 --> 02:52:30.382
TALIESIN: Cleric's right there.

02:52:30.382 --> 02:52:31.951
ASHLY: Is that a six or a nine?

02:52:31.951 --> 02:52:34.368
TALIESIN: That's a nine.

02:52:34.368 --> 02:52:36.896
ASHLY: That's a nine? Okay, so 13?

02:52:36.896 --> 02:52:43.381
MATT: 13? Oh, the paladin? Yeah, it definitely
misses the paladin. Her shield's too big. You go

02:52:43.381 --> 02:52:47.876
to bite her and she slams the shield out and you
catch metal instead. She pulls the shield away and

02:52:47.876 --> 02:52:52.431
you scrape tooth marks against the metal, which is
impressive for a goblin. She looks at you and

02:52:52.431 --> 02:52:58.418
goes, "You! You foul, terrible creature! You will
pay for what you've done!" You see tears in her

02:52:58.418 --> 02:53:00.841
eyes. That ends your turn?

02:53:00.841 --> 02:53:10.045
ASHLY: I go: Heh, loser. I'm going to stay there.
Maybe that's unwise, but I'm

02:53:10.045 --> 02:53:11.604
just going to stay there.

02:53:11.604 --> 02:53:19.708
MATT: The bard is too angry to even consider-- no.
No, he's too angry. He's not going to be able to

02:53:19.708 --> 02:53:24.010
do his bard performances this turn. He's too
fraught with frustration.

02:53:24.010 --> 02:53:26.664
He's going to cast Sleep.

02:53:26.664 --> 02:53:28.219
MARISHA: Oh, shit.

02:53:28.219 --> 02:53:36.967
MATT: As part of the Sleep spell, just to double
check what the saves are; I believe it's a will

02:53:36.967 --> 02:53:57.163
save. There we go, we got Sleep. Give me a second,
guys. I need you to make a will saving throw.

02:53:57.163 --> 02:53:59.635
ASHLY: A will saving throw? Okay.

02:53:59.635 --> 02:54:01.725
MATT: You get plus two because you're raging.

02:54:01.725 --> 02:54:04.141
ASHLY: Where is my--?

02:54:04.141 --> 02:54:08.455
TALIESIN: It's on the third square on the right.

02:54:08.455 --> 02:54:17.561
ASHLY: Oh, I see. Okay. 19.

02:54:17.561 --> 02:54:23.480
MATT: With that, you look over as the bard ends up
singing this incantation in a language you don't

02:54:23.480 --> 02:54:29.902
understand. You feel a wave of sudden sleepiness
hit you. One of your eyes begins to sag, and then

02:54:29.902 --> 02:54:35.813
you (grunts) shake it off. Foam forming at the
corner of your mouth. The bard goes (yelling).

02:54:35.813 --> 02:54:37.896
ASHLY: I go (blows raspberry).

02:54:37.896 --> 02:54:46.999
MATT: Unaffected by it. That ends his turn. The
paladin, friend is gone, cannot do anything yet,

02:54:46.999 --> 02:54:53.014
is going to angrily move this way to begin a
pincer movement and is going to power attack you.

02:54:53.014 --> 02:54:55.187
That is a natural 20.

02:54:55.187 --> 02:54:56.692
ASHLY: Oh no!

02:54:56.692 --> 02:55:07.048
MATT: See if it confirms. With a natural 18, I'm
pretty sure that hits. That's times two on that.

02:55:07.048 --> 02:55:20.170
You take-- it's not too bad, you take 12 points of
damage as the sword streaks down, cleaving off

02:55:20.170 --> 02:55:26.555
part of your ear and ends up embedding in your
shoulder. You look over, grab the sword, and pull

02:55:26.555 --> 02:55:30.805
it out and throw her backward. She's caught off
guard by how this tiny thing has so much might.

02:55:30.805 --> 02:55:49.523
That ends the paladin's turn there. We're going to
bring us to the cleric. The cleric is going to see

02:55:49.523 --> 02:55:57.078
how rough this is, circumstantially. She is
looking over at the bombing one. Moves over here,

02:55:57.078 --> 02:56:03.695
turns to you and goes, "You will set nothing more
ablaze, creature!" I need you to make a will

02:56:03.695 --> 02:56:04.767
saving throw.

02:56:04.767 --> 02:56:11.229
MARISHA: Eh? What? Natural one. Again.

02:56:11.229 --> 02:56:13.781
IVAN: You shouldn't even sit next to me.

02:56:13.781 --> 02:56:16.493
PHIL: Your luck is rubbing off.

02:56:16.493 --> 02:56:25.973
MATT: As the Hold Person takes effect, your muscles
lock up. As you're reaching for a bomb (grunting).

02:56:25.973 --> 02:56:32.102
You just can't move! You see a grin across the
cleric's face. "That's what I thought." Ending the

02:56:32.102 --> 02:56:38.956
cleric's turn. The fighter is gone. Boom.
Grizznak, you're down to negative two.

02:56:38.956 --> 02:56:43.993
IVAN: Yeah, negative two. Can I make a
constitution check to see if I can stabilize?

02:56:43.993 --> 02:56:49.135
MATT: Go ahead and make a fortitude save.

02:56:49.135 --> 02:56:51.535
IVAN: Fortitude save. Oh! 20!

02:56:51.535 --> 02:56:56.112
MATT: 20? I'll say, for the sake of this, you
manage to stabilize, you're no longer bleeding.

02:56:56.112 --> 02:57:01.689
You're good. That ending your turn. Mezek, you're
up.

02:57:01.689 --> 02:57:07.360
TALIESIN: I'm going to run up to the cleric who
just paralyzed my friend. I'm going to run right

02:57:07.360 --> 02:57:11.165
up to him. Him, her, I don't actually know the
right pronouns for the cleric.

02:57:11.165 --> 02:57:17.411
MATT: You frog leap over the raging Piglet, and
land.

02:57:17.411 --> 02:57:25.822
TALIESIN: And I (yells) and I open palm into the
throat to use a stunning fist to try to silence her.

02:57:25.822 --> 02:57:27.506
MATT: Go for an attack.

02:57:27.506 --> 02:57:33.074
TALIESIN: That's a 15?

02:57:33.074 --> 02:57:35.588
MATT: 15 hits! She doesn't have a huge armor
class.

02:57:35.588 --> 02:57:50.687
TALIESIN: I said fist, I'm doing fist. That's five
points of damage and needs to make a fortitude save.

02:57:50.687 --> 02:57:54.121
MATT: Which she rolls a five, she does not.

02:57:54.121 --> 02:57:55.480
TALIESIN: She is stunned for a round.

02:57:55.480 --> 02:58:02.736
MATT: Yep. As you jump over, leap to the ground
and then shoryuken-like upper fist to her chin.

02:58:02.736 --> 02:58:10.189
You see a tooth go flying and her helmet gets set
off. She pulls back. She drops the holy symbol in

02:58:10.189 --> 02:58:15.471
her hand, which now hangs from a chain, grabs at
her head going (groaning) and is doubled over

02:58:15.471 --> 02:58:20.743
unable to gather her senses right now. Ending your
turn there. Browntooth, you're up.

02:58:20.743 --> 02:58:24.666
PHIL: Crossbow attack at the paladin.

02:58:24.666 --> 02:58:28.149
MATT: Paladin? All right, go for it. Roll the
attack for that one.

02:58:28.149 --> 02:58:34.568
ASHLY: It's 14.

02:58:34.568 --> 02:58:39.574
TALIESIN: You could try to maybe reroll it with a song.
You haven't used your song yet.

02:58:39.574 --> 02:58:41.718
MATT: You haven't used your song yet, if you
wanted.

02:58:41.718 --> 02:58:45.417
ASHLY: Maybe this'll be the first time that it
gets a better roll.

02:58:45.417 --> 02:58:53.539
PHIL: Yes, this is the one time. And my life's
not at stake. All right. I will sing my song.

02:58:53.539 --> 02:58:55.239
MATT: What's your song?

02:58:55.239 --> 02:59:02.635
PHIL: (sings) When Browntooth axe lifts up high, someone
is about to die! Someone will bleed, lots will get

02:59:02.635 --> 02:59:08.573
bit, though I'd rather avoid direct conflict. I'm
Browntooth the Rogue!

02:59:08.573 --> 02:59:15.156
MATT: Go ahead and reroll that as you steel
yourself, locking in another bolt into the

02:59:15.156 --> 02:59:16.189
crossbow.

02:59:16.189 --> 02:59:22.498
IVAN: Songs are cursed! All of our songs are
cursed!

02:59:22.498 --> 02:59:24.064
MATT: (singing) Goblin songs are cursed!

02:59:24.064 --> 02:59:25.765
MARISHA: People hate goblin songs.

02:59:25.765 --> 02:59:27.359
PHIL: It's worse than K-Pop.

02:59:27.359 --> 02:59:30.555
MATT: I got you a sad trombone for you, there.

02:59:30.555 --> 02:59:34.810
IVAN: Yep. Deserve it.

02:59:34.810 --> 02:59:38.054
PHIL: Man. At least I didn't die. No offense.

02:59:38.054 --> 02:59:39.931
IVAN: None taken.

02:59:39.931 --> 02:59:50.201
MATT: As the crossbow bolt goes off somewhere into
the skyline, you're realizing perhaps the distance

02:59:50.201 --> 02:59:54.466
game isn't working for you. Might need to get up
close and personal if you're going to land an

02:59:54.466 --> 02:59:56.523
attack here. Are you going to stay where you are?

02:59:56.523 --> 03:00:08.563
PHIL: Is the church that way?

03:00:08.563 --> 03:00:11.914
MATT: The church is up here. These are the steps
to the church.

03:00:11.914 --> 03:00:22.510
PHIL: I move over to the edge of the podium.

03:00:22.510 --> 03:00:24.367
MATT: Over here?

03:00:24.367 --> 03:00:25.457
PHIL: Yeah.

03:00:25.457 --> 03:00:28.471
MATT: Roll to see if you can remain stealthed.

03:00:28.471 --> 03:00:31.647
PHIL: 30.

03:00:31.647 --> 03:00:37.262
MATT: All right. Ending your turn. Brings it to
Snizzler. You're locked in place. Make a will

03:00:37.262 --> 03:00:41.604
saving throw to see if you can resist the effect
of the Hold Person spell.

03:00:41.604 --> 03:00:45.479
MARISHA: Just a straight will save?

03:00:45.479 --> 03:00:46.589
MATT: Yeah.

03:00:46.589 --> 03:00:47.888
MARISHA: Three.

03:00:47.888 --> 03:00:50.542
TALIESIN: How is that even humanly--?

03:00:50.542 --> 03:00:54.547
MATT: Unable to shake the effect. You're still
locked in place. Hand on the bomb. You're looking

03:00:54.547 --> 03:00:58.215
down at it. You were about to light it and your
hand is hovering there and you're like

03:00:58.215 --> 03:00:59.423
(strains).

03:00:59.423 --> 03:01:03.664
TALIESIN: I cast Methadone.

03:01:03.664 --> 03:01:05.461
MATT: Piglet, you're up.

03:01:05.461 --> 03:01:10.551
ASHLY: I'm going to rage. I'm going to attack the
paladin.

03:01:10.551 --> 03:01:13.119
MATT: You can both hammer and bite.

03:01:13.119 --> 03:01:15.044
ASHLY: I'm going to do both.

03:01:15.044 --> 03:01:16.528
MATT: Go for it.

03:01:16.528 --> 03:01:18.378
ASHLY: 18 plus nine.

03:01:18.378 --> 03:01:20.464
MATT: That hits. Go ahead and roll the hammer
damage.

03:01:20.464 --> 03:01:23.117
MARISHA: Roll that hammer damage!

03:01:23.117 --> 03:01:25.017
ASHLY: That is 12.

03:01:25.017 --> 03:01:31.177
MATT: 12? Ooh! As you bring up and slam the hammer
down, she pushes the shield up to block the blow,

03:01:31.177 --> 03:01:35.968
but the mallet catches over the top. The sheer
weight of it pushes the shield away as it comes

03:01:35.968 --> 03:01:41.636
down and slams into the side of her chin. You can
see the jaw breaks from the impact. A little bit

03:01:41.636 --> 03:01:46.203
of blood begins to trickle out of the corner of her
mouth. She's like (pained grunting). She spits a

03:01:46.203 --> 03:01:48.938
glob of blood across her otherwise pristine silver
armor.

03:01:48.938 --> 03:01:51.801
PHIL: Seriously, she's all about cliches. Does she
do this?

03:01:51.801 --> 03:01:55.620
MATT: Roll for the bite attack.

03:01:55.620 --> 03:02:01.044
ASHLY: 18 plus four.

03:02:01.044 --> 03:02:04.659
MATT: That also hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

03:02:04.659 --> 03:02:06.199
ASHLY: A d3 plus three.

03:02:06.199 --> 03:02:08.636
MATT: Roll a d6, halve that, add three.

03:02:08.636 --> 03:02:11.709
ASHLY: Four.

03:02:11.709 --> 03:02:15.265
MATT: Four points of damage. As she's reacting
from that and spits the blood out, looks down, you

03:02:15.265 --> 03:02:19.960
run up the side of her shield and bite into the
chin you just broke and tear a chunk out of her

03:02:19.960 --> 03:02:26.041
face! She's like, (screaming) "Who does
that?!"

03:02:26.041 --> 03:02:28.717
ASHLY: Piglet does, bitches!

03:02:28.717 --> 03:02:36.073
MATT: That ends Piglet's turn. The bard, whose
spell has been less than active, and the wizard who

03:02:36.073 --> 03:02:41.667
spent his last term in absolute horror of his
friend, regains his senses and is going to step up.

03:02:41.667 --> 03:02:43.495
ASHLY: Oh, I forgot about the wizard.

03:02:43.495 --> 03:02:47.511
MATT: Yeah, the wizard hid off to the side and
watched his friend get beheaded and spent the turn

03:02:47.511 --> 03:02:55.495
looking in horror. The bard is going to attempt to
cast Sleep on you again.

03:02:55.495 --> 03:02:57.992
Make another willpower save.

03:02:57.992 --> 03:03:03.905
ASHLY: I'm raging, so it still applies, right? 18
plus three.

03:03:03.905 --> 03:03:08.763
MATT: 18 plus three. Once again, shrug off the
effect. And he's like, "Why won't you stay down,

03:03:08.763 --> 03:03:13.215
"stupid thing?!" He's pointing his finger,
clutching his flute angrily in the other hand.

03:03:13.215 --> 03:03:15.215
Nothing is affecting you.

03:03:15.215 --> 03:03:16.483
TALIESIN: Red Bull!

03:03:16.483 --> 03:03:23.324
MATT: He's going to rush over to the side behind
the cleric now and be like, "Can you heal me?

03:03:23.324 --> 03:03:30.688
"Please!" He's running off to the side and asking
for a heal. The paladin is going to, as a reaction

03:03:30.688 --> 03:03:39.955
to you, furiously swing at you with the longsword.
That is a 22 to hit.

03:03:39.955 --> 03:03:41.675
ASHLY: It hits.

03:03:41.675 --> 03:03:48.697
MATT: That hits. You take seven points of slashing
damage as the blade streaks down across you.

03:03:48.697 --> 03:03:54.631
You're still chewing the chunk of her face that's
running around in your jaw, but the blade goes

03:03:54.631 --> 03:04:00.145
across the front of your torso, and leaves an
opening that begins to spill dark, brackish,

03:04:00.145 --> 03:04:05.351
goblin blood. You don't even feel the pain. You're
in such a furious bloodlust right now.

03:04:05.351 --> 03:04:08.075
ASHLY: So, next round might be my last round,
guys.

03:04:08.075 --> 03:04:11.119
PHIL: When we get down to two, I'm going to take
off.

03:04:11.119 --> 03:04:13.633
ASHLY: I got 11 hit points left.

03:04:13.633 --> 03:04:15.327
MATT: The wizard's going to step forward now.

03:04:15.327 --> 03:04:17.633
TALIESIN: This round might be your last round.

03:04:17.633 --> 03:04:22.728
MATT: Going to go ahead and cast Magic Missile.
One arcs off at you while you're held in place.

03:04:22.728 --> 03:04:24.431
MARISHA: Oh, shit!

03:04:24.431 --> 03:04:30.047
MATT: One's going to streak off and hit you.
Mezek, you take two points of force damage.

03:04:30.047 --> 03:04:37.787
Snizzler, you take three points of force damage as
two missiles arc off and slam into the sides of

03:04:37.787 --> 03:04:46.451
you from the arcane nature of the spell. That ends
his turn. The cleric can't do anything, is stunned

03:04:46.451 --> 03:04:51.812
this round. Manages to shrug it off, but has
absolutely no way of using any of her abilities

03:04:51.812 --> 03:04:56.369
because of the fist in the face she got from
Mezek. Grizznak!

03:04:56.369 --> 03:04:59.145
IVAN: (singing) I found a nest of baby birds.

03:04:59.145 --> 03:05:03.188
MATT: Finishing that. Mezek, it's your turn.

03:05:03.188 --> 03:05:13.811
TALIESIN: I'm going to use my Flurry of Blows, with my
quarterstaff, and I'm going to use Stunning Fist, again.

03:05:13.811 --> 03:05:15.151
MATT: Your last?

03:05:15.151 --> 03:05:16.159
TALIESIN: Yeah.

03:05:16.159 --> 03:05:19.011
MATT: Go for it! So you are doing two punches or
two hits with your quarterstaff?

03:05:19.011 --> 03:05:21.299
TALIESIN: Well, Stunning First, is it fist or
first?

03:05:21.299 --> 03:05:26.439
MATT: Stunning Fist is as an attack; you can have
it be a Stunning Fist attack.

03:05:26.439 --> 03:05:31.078
TALIESIN: So I'm going to (punching sounds). I'm
going to use the quarterstaff.

03:05:31.078 --> 03:05:33.136
MATT: So roll for that, see if it hits.

03:05:33.136 --> 03:05:39.255
TALIESIN: For the Stunning Fist first; that's 20.

03:05:39.255 --> 03:05:46.177
MATT: 20, that hits. Go ahead and roll damage on
that. Rolls a seven.

03:05:46.177 --> 03:05:48.083
TALIESIN: That's six points of damage.

03:05:48.083 --> 03:05:51.794
MATT: Six points of damage and she is stunned
again. Quarterstaff clocks her upside the head,

03:05:51.794 --> 03:05:55.547
now causing the armor to bend in on her temple and
one eye has gone a little

03:05:55.547 --> 03:05:57.456
cross-eyed from the impact.

03:05:57.456 --> 03:05:58.848
TALIESIN: So I'm going to hit her again.

03:05:58.848 --> 03:06:00.031
PHIL: Who'd you hit?

03:06:00.031 --> 03:06:03.581
TALIESIN: The cleric. The cleric is unconscious.
They can't do another round of anything.

03:06:03.581 --> 03:06:04.770
ASHLY: That's true.

03:06:04.770 --> 03:06:05.895
TALIESIN: Hitting her again.

03:06:05.895 --> 03:06:07.171
MATT: Go for it.

03:06:07.171 --> 03:06:09.105
TALIESIN: That's 12.

03:06:09.105 --> 03:06:11.765
MATT: 12 total bonus?

03:06:11.765 --> 03:06:13.039
TALIESIN: To hit.

03:06:13.039 --> 03:06:18.192
MATT: She is currently flat-footed with the armor
that's still 14, so yeah.

03:06:18.192 --> 03:06:20.432
ASHLY: Is it time?

03:06:20.432 --> 03:06:21.574
TALIESIN: It's time.

03:06:21.574 --> 03:06:27.470
Reroll that. (singing) Mezek, Mezek the
songs he is keen, so pour a pint of beer for me or

03:06:27.470 --> 03:06:29.205
I'll punch you in the spleen ugh!

03:06:29.205 --> 03:06:31.680
ASHLY: Come on, this is our only chance!

03:06:31.680 --> 03:06:35.085
TALIESIN: Yay! 19!

03:06:35.085 --> 03:06:37.059
MATT: 19 hits, roll damage.

03:06:37.059 --> 03:06:43.937
TALIESIN: I'll use the flashy pink one. Oh, that's
better! Eight points of damage, boom!

03:06:43.937 --> 03:06:46.008
MATT: Eight points of damage, how do you want to
finish off the cleric?

03:06:46.008 --> 03:06:47.463
ASHLY: You did it!

03:06:47.463 --> 03:06:52.839
TALIESIN: Quarterstaff one to the front and then I
just want the quarterstaff to find a chink in the

03:06:52.839 --> 03:06:59.064
armor and just watch the head cleave with just
stick. A big melty, awful cleave. Like, wood

03:06:59.064 --> 03:07:00.376
should not cleave.

03:07:00.376 --> 03:07:01.933
ASHLY: You should aim it at someone.

03:07:01.933 --> 03:07:06.204
MATT: So, after you slam her in the side of the
head, stunning her, she leans forward from the

03:07:06.204 --> 03:07:15.292
impact. You spin the staff in one hand and then do
a golf swing up the side of the head. You hit at

03:07:15.292 --> 03:07:22.220
such a way that you cause the bent metal of the
helmet to act like a guillotine-like blade. With a

03:07:22.220 --> 03:07:26.486
(boomp) her head, up in the air, rolls on the
ground, the bard who came up to ask for healing,

03:07:26.486 --> 03:07:30.080
"Heal me, Heal me!" and the body slumps down on
the ground in front of him, and the head lands a

03:07:30.080 --> 03:07:31.319
second later.

03:07:31.319 --> 03:07:33.210
IVAN: That's two heads for you!

03:07:33.210 --> 03:07:37.352
MATT: And he rolls a one on his will save, he is
currently horribly shaken by this experience and

03:07:37.352 --> 03:07:40.478
is having penalties from watching his two friends
lose their head in the same battle.

03:07:40.478 --> 03:07:44.870
TALIESIN: Am I within quarterstaff contact of anyone
else?

03:07:44.870 --> 03:07:47.505
MATT: Currently the bard, yeah.

03:07:47.505 --> 03:07:50.098
TALIESIN: I'm going to hit the bard. I'm going to
spend my ki attack and hit the bard.

03:07:50.098 --> 03:07:51.620
MATT: Okay.

03:07:51.620 --> 03:07:56.324
MARISHA: About the time the adventuring party
starts rethinking their career choices.

03:07:56.324 --> 03:07:58.910
PHIL: Ooh, it's flashing baby!!

03:07:58.910 --> 03:08:00.257
MARISHA: Natural 20!

03:08:00.257 --> 03:08:01.706
MATT: Roll to confirm crit.

03:08:01.706 --> 03:08:03.966
MARISHA: Come on, come on! Big money, no
whammies!

03:08:03.966 --> 03:08:06.733
TALIESIN: 11.

03:08:06.733 --> 03:08:11.093
MATT: 11. I'll say with the penalties he has
suffered from watching his friends die, I'll say

03:08:11.093 --> 03:08:12.537
it just barely hits.

03:08:12.537 --> 03:08:19.611
IVAN: Taliesin is MVPing this so hard.

03:08:19.611 --> 03:08:24.991
TALIESIN: 14 points of damage. Straight stab.

03:08:24.991 --> 03:08:27.786
MATT: How do you want to do this to the bard?

03:08:27.786 --> 03:08:32.572
TALIESIN: I want to go straight through the mouth
all the way through the skull and I want to hold

03:08:32.572 --> 03:08:33.792
it there.

03:08:33.792 --> 03:08:39.372
MATT: As he is screaming, the staff goes through,
bursts out the back of the base of the spine where

03:08:39.372 --> 03:08:43.787
the brain connects and goes (gurgling). Blood
dribbling down the side of his mouth,

03:08:43.787 --> 03:08:45.162
you hold him aloft.

03:08:45.162 --> 03:08:47.091
TALIESIN: Music to my ears! (laughs)

03:08:47.091 --> 03:08:50.015
MATT: What do you do with the corpse at the end of
the staff?

03:08:50.015 --> 03:08:51.922
TALIESIN: I'm going to hold it for my next attack
on the next round.

03:08:51.922 --> 03:08:57.428
MATT: Okay, he is currently now held limp against
your staff just being held aloft by your weapon.

03:08:57.428 --> 03:08:59.043
ASHLY: Oh my god.

03:08:59.043 --> 03:09:00.395
MATT: Absurd.

03:09:00.395 --> 03:09:01.512
TALIESIN: Fuck yeah!

03:09:01.512 --> 03:09:07.831
PHIL: How many are left? Paladin and wizard?

03:09:07.831 --> 03:09:13.681
MATT: There is the wizard and the paladin and they
are both looking around themselves and wondering

03:09:13.681 --> 03:09:17.250
how these goblins steamrolled their adventuring
party.

03:09:17.250 --> 03:09:20.126
PHIL: And I'm still stealthed right? So this
would be sneak attack?

03:09:20.126 --> 03:09:22.124
MATT: As far as you know, yes.

03:09:22.124 --> 03:09:24.706
PHIL: Crossbow at the paladin.

03:09:24.706 --> 03:09:26.607
MATT: Crossbow to the paladin. Go for it.

03:09:26.607 --> 03:09:29.237
PHIL: 19.

03:09:29.237 --> 03:09:34.357
MATT: 19 hits. What is the critical range on the
crossbow? Does it just say times something?

03:09:34.357 --> 03:09:35.475
PHIL: 19 to 20.

03:09:35.475 --> 03:09:37.346
MATT: So roll again to see if it crits.

03:09:37.346 --> 03:09:40.992
PHIL: 18!

03:09:40.992 --> 03:09:47.517
MATT: Go ahead and roll double damage on that.
Roll 2d6 plus sneak attack,

03:09:47.517 --> 03:09:49.104
so 4d6 damage total on this.

03:09:49.104 --> 03:09:51.027
ALL: Oh my god.

03:09:51.027 --> 03:09:56.672
MARISHA: Yeah, Browntooth!

03:09:56.672 --> 03:10:06.088
IVAN: Grizznak was the goblin sacrifice to
Zarongel to make all of you succeed.

03:10:06.088 --> 03:10:07.572
TALIESIN: Holy shit!

03:10:07.572 --> 03:10:10.920
PHIL: 16.

03:10:10.920 --> 03:10:17.953
MATT: How do you want to finish the paladin? How
do you want to do this, Phil? The paladin's back

03:10:17.953 --> 03:10:24.389
is to you, bearing down on Piglet now. Both
bloodied and engaged in gladiatorial combat, this

03:10:24.389 --> 03:10:28.921
tiny goblin meat shield and this shielded piece of
human meat.

03:10:28.921 --> 03:10:31.158
PHIL: Does the paladin have a helmet?

03:10:31.158 --> 03:10:33.310
MATT: She does, yes.

03:10:33.483 --> 03:10:36.059
ASHLY: You could go for the hat trick of
decapitation, if you wanted.

03:10:36.059 --> 03:10:39.340
It's really up to you.

03:10:39.340 --> 03:10:43.299
IVAN: Bard's dead, though, now. It wouldn't be
funny unless you landed in the--

03:10:43.299 --> 03:10:44.587
TALIESIN: Still funny.

03:10:44.587 --> 03:10:46.165
PHIL: Can I get to her ear?

03:10:46.165 --> 03:10:47.435
MATT: Yeah!

03:10:47.435 --> 03:10:49.923
PHIL: In one ear, out the other.

03:10:49.923 --> 03:10:54.722
MATT: As you aim carefully, you wait for her as
the blows trade back and forth between her and

03:10:54.722 --> 03:10:59.336
Piglet. After the hit, she pulls back and spits
off to the side and you can see the front of her

03:10:59.336 --> 03:11:04.115
face. As her head turns back, you use that moment
to release and catch it right in the side of the

03:11:04.115 --> 03:11:09.665
helmet where the ear would be. The bolt out one
side and gets partially out the other. She stands

03:11:09.665 --> 03:11:16.343
there for a second before (thud) to the knees,
face first on the ground in the mud.

03:11:16.343 --> 03:11:24.418
MARISHA: Man, left side of the table today. Table
Right is just sucking it up. We don't need to be

03:11:24.418 --> 03:11:25.679
here, really.

03:11:25.679 --> 03:11:29.392
MATT: Snizzler, make a will saving throw.

03:11:29.392 --> 03:11:32.436
MARISHA: Even though she's dead, it doesn't just
break?

03:11:32.436 --> 03:11:37.718
MATT: You know what? The spell does break because
the cleric's dead. You regain control of yourself.

03:11:37.718 --> 03:11:39.167
Thank you for the reminder.

03:11:39.167 --> 03:11:46.109
MARISHA: Good work, Team Left! Yeah! Good work,
Grizz, even though you're still unconscious.

03:11:46.109 --> 03:11:49.489
MATT: There's one wizard that rushed out of the
alleyway like, okay, I can do this! Runs out and

03:11:49.489 --> 03:11:55.531
all of his friends are dead and his chin's
quivering under his short, gray beard.

03:11:55.531 --> 03:11:56.739
It is your turn.

03:11:56.739 --> 03:11:57.748
MARISHA: Where is he at?

03:11:57.748 --> 03:11:58.924
MATT: Right there.

03:11:58.924 --> 03:12:10.818
MARISHA: I see the wizard and I take a step back
onto the platform right behind me. I take out my

03:12:10.818 --> 03:12:12.788
goblin bomb launcher.

03:12:12.788 --> 03:12:16.788
PHIL: Is that a thing?!

03:12:16.788 --> 03:12:17.924
MARISHA: Yeah!

03:12:17.924 --> 03:12:19.242
TALIESIN: It is now!

03:12:19.242 --> 03:12:28.274
MARISHA: I go, all right! I arc it upwards and I
go boof and aim for the wizard.

03:12:28.274 --> 03:12:31.770
PHIL: Thankfully, he's far enough away that none of the
rest of us will catch fire.

03:12:31.770 --> 03:12:37.087
MATT: A cross between a bazooka and a large egg
shell. She jams the bomb into it. As it detonates,

03:12:37.087 --> 03:12:44.032
it sends out a wave of smoke and ash. It blows
apart and sets you on your feet from the impact of

03:12:44.032 --> 03:12:50.146
the launcher. Roll the attack, it doubles the
range. That's just enough.

03:12:50.146 --> 03:12:54.063
MARISHA: 18!

03:12:54.063 --> 03:13:01.389
MATT: 18 does hit. His armor, with mage armor, of
16. Go ahead and roll damage on that. That's 2d6

03:13:01.389 --> 03:13:05.036
plus three plus 1d4 because of your explosive
feat.

03:13:05.036 --> 03:13:13.296
MARISHA: Six plus three plus two, so 11 damage.

03:13:13.296 --> 03:13:19.831
MATT: 11 points of damage and he is on fire. As he
looks over and is like, "My friends. What?!"

03:13:19.831 --> 03:13:26.296
(explosion) He's screaming on fire.

03:13:26.296 --> 03:13:28.299
PHIL: Water balloon from hell.

03:13:28.299 --> 03:13:29.898
IVAN: Whee!

03:13:29.898 --> 03:13:34.158
MATT: That's Snizzler's turn. Piglet, you're up.

03:13:34.158 --> 03:13:37.056
ASHLY: Wizard! I run.

03:13:37.056 --> 03:13:39.996
IVAN: Wizard!

03:13:39.996 --> 03:13:43.683
MATT: Leaping on top of the cart that is there
before him.

03:13:43.683 --> 03:13:50.426
ASHLY: As expected, I rage. I'm going to do the
Skullbreaker on him.

03:13:50.426 --> 03:13:52.523
MATT: Go for it. Leaping in the air.

03:13:52.523 --> 03:13:54.279
ASHLY: Oh no! That was terrible! 11.

03:13:54.279 --> 03:13:59.836
MATT: You go and swing with the hammer, and
because the flames are hot in your face, you swing

03:13:59.836 --> 03:14:08.342
wide and end up smashing part of the cart instead.
He looks at you through the fire going, "No!"

03:14:08.342 --> 03:14:10.586
TALIESIN: Can you take a bite?

03:14:10.586 --> 03:14:11.646
ASHLY: No.

03:14:11.646 --> 03:14:15.996
MATT: You have to be right up close to do that.
That finishes your turn, Piglet. Everyone else is

03:14:15.996 --> 03:14:24.033
dead. The wizard is in the flames going, "No!" and
put out his hands like this and a gout of fire

03:14:24.033 --> 03:14:28.070
like a flamethrower bursts from the arcane
energies. Go ahead and roll d6 fire damage,

03:14:28.070 --> 03:14:29.473
by the way.

03:14:29.473 --> 03:14:35.080
MARISHA: Burn, wizard, burn! Another point of
damage.

03:14:35.080 --> 03:14:40.180
ASHLY: Man, that's going to be a bummer way to go
out after I missed a hammer attack.

03:14:40.180 --> 03:14:44.111
MATT: Go ahead and make a reflex save, if you
could.

03:14:44.111 --> 03:14:45.331
ASHLY: Nine.

03:14:45.331 --> 03:14:46.610
TALIESIN: Plus your reflex save?

03:14:46.610 --> 03:14:47.885
ASHLY: Yeah.

03:14:47.885 --> 03:14:50.074
MATT: You take six points of fire damage.

03:14:50.074 --> 03:14:51.618
ASHLY: I'm still alive!

03:14:51.618 --> 03:14:58.797
MATT: Through the flames, more flames come. You
burn, the cinders. What little bit of hair may have existed

03:14:58.797 --> 03:15:05.903
on you is gone. You are a charred, black mass of
cracked goblin flesh and anger. You're enjoying

03:15:05.903 --> 03:15:11.161
being on the edge of death. That ends his turn. No
one else is alive. You.

03:15:11.161 --> 03:15:16.019
IVAN: Hi. I found the bird's nest!

03:15:16.019 --> 03:15:18.157
MATT: Mezek, you're up.

03:15:18.157 --> 03:15:25.207
TALIESIN: I want to see if I can get enough of a
pull to remove the head of the bard from the body

03:15:25.207 --> 03:15:29.931
and fling it as a projectile attack at the
wizard.

03:15:29.931 --> 03:15:31.245
MATT: You're horrible!

03:15:31.245 --> 03:15:33.058
TALIESIN: I'm the worst person you know!

03:15:33.058 --> 03:15:38.794
MATT: You can use that. We're going to consider
this an improvised ranged weapon. Go ahead and

03:15:38.794 --> 03:15:44.566
roll an attack with your dexterity bonus as opposed
to your strength bonus. With a minus four, because

03:15:44.566 --> 03:15:47.211
you're not proficient in ranged improvised
weapons. Just melee ones.

03:15:47.211 --> 03:15:48.274
TALIESIN: That'll work.

03:15:48.274 --> 03:15:50.423
MATT: What's your dex modifier?

03:15:50.423 --> 03:15:51.383
TALIESIN: Four.

03:15:51.383 --> 03:15:55.278
MATT: Roll a d20 and add three to it.

03:15:55.278 --> 03:15:56.290
TALIESIN: Add three?

03:15:56.290 --> 03:15:57.509
MATT: Just your attack bonus.

03:15:57.509 --> 03:15:58.734
PHIL: He's just making shit up!

03:15:58.734 --> 03:16:02.338
TALIESIN: 14.

03:16:02.338 --> 03:16:06.894
MATT: 14 unfortunately misses. You look through
the flames, he goes (heavy panting) and looks over

03:16:06.894 --> 03:16:12.009
as the bard head careens towards him and ricochets
off his arcane armor. He goes (screaming).

03:16:12.009 --> 03:16:13.882
TALIESIN: I'm running straight towards him.

03:16:13.882 --> 03:16:23.133
MATT: Your monk speed, you get right next to him.
He's being surrounded now. Browntooth.

03:16:23.133 --> 03:16:29.644
PHIL: I can't reach him, can I? Can I shoot him?

03:16:29.644 --> 03:16:31.770
ASHLY: Everyone else is dead, so you can get
closer.

03:16:31.770 --> 03:16:32.920
PHIL: Oh, that's true.

03:16:32.920 --> 03:16:34.371
MATT: You can move this way.

03:16:34.371 --> 03:16:36.511
PHIL: I'll move up to the wizard.

03:16:36.511 --> 03:16:38.613
MATT: You can get there and see him off to the
side.

03:16:38.613 --> 03:16:41.262
TALIESIN: He's flanked, also.

03:16:41.262 --> 03:16:45.202
IVAN: Why didn't you run, wizard?

03:16:45.202 --> 03:16:47.654
PHIL: Am I flanking him?

03:16:47.654 --> 03:16:53.538
MATT: Roll a stealth to see if he sees you. He
does not. He is so distracted with all his dead

03:16:53.538 --> 03:16:57.460
friends and being on fire, there's no way he can
beat your stealth score with a six he rolled.

03:16:57.460 --> 03:16:58.448
PHIL: 28.

03:16:58.448 --> 03:17:00.246
MATT: Yeah, you're fine. Go ahead and roll an
attack.

03:17:00.246 --> 03:17:06.660
IVAN: Watch as Phil finishes off the final
character for the night.

03:17:06.660 --> 03:17:08.848
PHIL: 16.

03:17:08.848 --> 03:17:16.504
MATT: 16 just hits! Go ahead and roll. That is his
AC with mage armor. Go ahead and roll 3d6.

03:17:16.504 --> 03:17:22.683
PHIL: 13.

03:17:22.683 --> 03:17:25.461
MATT: 13. How do you want to do this?

03:17:25.461 --> 03:17:26.674
ASHLY: Wow!

03:17:26.674 --> 03:17:28.380
MARISHA: Yeah!

03:17:28.380 --> 03:17:35.293
MATT: On fire, looking aghast at the heroes slain
around him.

03:17:35.293 --> 03:17:38.462
PHIL: Nose?

03:17:38.462 --> 03:17:41.410
IVAN: Nose.

03:17:41.410 --> 03:17:44.512
TALIESIN: Nose is good, we haven't done that.

03:17:44.512 --> 03:17:49.480
PHIL: Right through his nose. Up the nose, into
the brain.

03:17:49.480 --> 03:17:55.011
MATT: He's over there and he's like (heavy
breathing). As he looks over, up to the sky, for

03:17:55.011 --> 03:18:03.442
the first time in his entire existence becoming a
religious man. At the cathedral. The flames behind

03:18:03.442 --> 03:18:13.253
the cathedral from the mounting goblin hordes that
are descending upon this square. He goes, "Why?"

03:18:13.253 --> 03:18:19.690
as the bolt strikes him right in the center. His
eyes go wide and, slo-mo, (thud). The flames

03:18:19.690 --> 03:18:24.204
(sizzling) consuming the rest of his body on the
ground.

03:18:24.204 --> 03:18:29.835
MARISHA: Whoa! That was rad! Rad!

03:18:29.835 --> 03:18:35.080
MATT: You guys can now hear the screams in the
distance still growing louder. You can barely see

03:18:35.080 --> 03:18:39.889
the shadows of the Seven-Tooth goblin horde coming
down the mountain,

03:18:39.889 --> 03:18:41.319
coming through the alleyway here.

03:18:41.319 --> 03:18:42.485
TALIESIN: Back to the sewers!

03:18:42.485 --> 03:18:43.433
PHIL: Now can we go?!

03:18:43.433 --> 03:18:49.109
MARISHA: Hang on. Snizzler walks over and pours a
Cure Light Wounds down.

03:18:49.109 --> 03:18:51.267
IVAN: You had one this entire time?

03:18:51.267 --> 03:18:52.437
MARISHA: Just one.

03:18:52.437 --> 03:18:54.295
TALIESIN: Power was with her all along.

03:18:54.295 --> 03:18:55.874
MATT: You gain five hit points.

03:18:55.874 --> 03:18:59.780
IVAN: Hey, guys. Did we win? Oh!

03:18:59.780 --> 03:19:03.913
PHIL: Thanks for your help!

03:19:03.913 --> 03:19:06.538
MARISHA: Dude, you were unconscious. It was so
cool.

03:19:06.538 --> 03:19:11.693
IVAN: Did anyone die in a really cool and very
glorifying way?

03:19:11.693 --> 03:19:15.075
MARISHA: Yeah, you did, man! It was awesome.

03:19:15.075 --> 03:19:17.403
IVAN: Well, shit!

03:19:17.403 --> 03:19:19.730
MARISHA: Yeah! All right, let's go.

03:19:19.730 --> 03:19:21.008
ASHLY: We run.

03:19:21.008 --> 03:19:29.582
IVAN: Also, before I leave, goblin dickbutt,
goblin dickbutt.

03:19:29.582 --> 03:19:40.222
MATT: Every corpse is marked appropriately
with your victory token of the goblin dickbutt.

03:19:40.222 --> 03:19:44.741
MARISHA: As they go down into the sewer, I'm going
to be the last one and I'm going to take my last

03:19:44.741 --> 03:19:50.055
bomb launcher. I'm going to aim for the church.

03:19:50.055 --> 03:19:53.267
TALIESIN: I'm so proud of you.

03:19:53.267 --> 03:19:55.117
IVAN: That's the best!

03:19:55.117 --> 03:19:58.125
MATT: (laughing) Roll an attack!

03:19:58.125 --> 03:20:06.270
MARISHA: In the sushi again! Ooh! 21.

03:20:06.270 --> 03:20:14.400
MATT: (explosion) You see an explosion as flames
begin to burn up on the long tapestries that hang in

03:20:14.400 --> 03:20:20.289
the front of the temple. Inside, you see two
people that were hiding in the temple from the

03:20:20.289 --> 03:20:25.538
goblin hordes come running out on fire just as the
goblin hordes round the corner and go (screaming)

03:20:25.538 --> 03:20:32.427
and rush and start striking them down, stabbing
them repeatedly with their blades. The rest of the

03:20:32.427 --> 03:20:37.515
temple begins to catch flames as it licks out the
sides of the now-shattering stained glass. You nod

03:20:37.515 --> 03:20:40.247
your head proudly before you dart back into the sewer
after your friends.

03:20:40.247 --> 03:20:41.431
MARISHA: Grizz.

03:20:41.431 --> 03:20:43.032
IVAN: What's this?

03:20:43.032 --> 03:20:46.076
MARISHA: This is my art.

03:20:46.076 --> 03:20:48.291
PHIL: (singing) Amazing Grace.

03:20:48.291 --> 03:20:51.315
TALIESIN: (singing) How sweet the sound!

03:20:51.315 --> 03:20:54.114
IVAN: I'm so proud of you.

03:20:54.114 --> 03:20:56.860
MARISHA: Thank you, man. It's beautiful.

03:20:56.860 --> 03:21:04.060
MATT: You guys your way out of what remains of the
town of Sandpoint. Heroes left scattered across

03:21:04.060 --> 03:21:10.085
the center of the festival grounds. Make your way
all the way back to your home.

03:21:10.085 --> 03:21:14.255
PHIL: All right, now I'm glad I didn't run away.

03:21:14.255 --> 03:21:16.669
ASHLY: Aren't you? That was pretty sick.

03:21:16.669 --> 03:21:20.608
MATT: You head past to the west side of the
Devil's Platter Mountains to the home

03:21:20.608 --> 03:21:22.438
of where your--

03:21:22.438 --> 03:21:23.963
PHIL: Old Guffeye.

03:21:23.963 --> 03:21:31.622
MATT: Yep. Where Old Guffeye is. You head back
into her cavernous abode. She sits there waiting.

03:21:31.622 --> 03:21:41.708
There's a smell of extremely nasty boiling liquid.
She spins around. "You! You've returned! And do you

03:21:41.708 --> 03:21:45.651
"bring me the promised stone?"

03:21:45.651 --> 03:21:49.452
ASHLY: Well, I helped a lot! But--

03:21:49.452 --> 03:21:52.217
PHIL: I brought the stone!

03:21:52.217 --> 03:21:54.911
MATT: "Give me it. Give it to me."

03:21:54.911 --> 03:21:56.274
PHIL: I hand to her.

03:21:56.274 --> 03:22:03.538
MATT: She takes the stone. "Yes!" The Lady's
blessing upon you all. She spins around, drops the

03:22:03.538 --> 03:22:12.796
stone in the pot and begins stirring it. "Stone
soup for meal tonight! Flavored well with victory.

03:22:12.796 --> 03:22:17.430
"You've earned a fine meal, my goblins!"

03:22:17.430 --> 03:22:22.751
(cheering)

03:22:22.751 --> 03:22:29.311
MATT: As she pours you all your evening's meal of
boom-boom stone soup, you recount the tales of the

03:22:29.311 --> 03:22:35.209
horrible slaughter that befell those who walked in
your path. You realize you managed to bring back a

03:22:35.209 --> 03:22:37.960
trench coat as part of your victory prize.

03:22:37.960 --> 03:22:40.647
PHIL: Stir in a little bit of dried meat with it.

03:22:40.647 --> 03:22:44.941
IVAN: We throw it on top of our trophy pile.

03:22:44.941 --> 03:22:46.950
TALIESIN: And an empty snuff box tin.

03:22:46.950 --> 03:22:51.288
MARISHA: And some poo and some bottles for molotov
cocktails.

03:22:51.288 --> 03:22:53.535
MATT: A masterful bounty you've collected this
evening.

03:22:53.535 --> 03:22:55.820
IVAN: I cast Grease on all of us.

03:22:55.820 --> 03:23:00.330
MARISHA: Slip'n'Slide!

03:23:00.330 --> 03:23:08.160
MATT: Freeze frame credit roll. (singing) Anyway
you want, that's the way you need it. And that is

03:23:08.160 --> 03:23:15.215
your game tonight, your one-shot Pathfinder game.
Big thank you, once again, to Paizo and to

03:23:15.215 --> 03:23:20.557
Syrinscape for helping us put this together, for
bringing the prizes for our fantastic audience.

03:23:20.557 --> 03:23:27.408
Thank you all for watching this wondrously chaotic
goblin spree that transpired. Big round of

03:23:27.408 --> 03:23:30.290
applause for our players this evening. You did
amazing.

03:23:30.290 --> 03:23:33.997
PHIL: Pure, unadulterated Id.

03:23:33.997 --> 03:23:42.627
IVAN: Seriously, #TeamLeftSide. For all of the
deaths you dished out.

03:23:42.627 --> 03:23:46.999
MATT: We're rolling for the grand prize winner
right now. While they're doing that, I don't know

03:23:46.999 --> 03:23:55.481
if you're aware, but you systematically slaughtered
the Iconic Heroes of the Pathfinder universe.

03:23:55.481 --> 03:23:57.635
ASHLY: That's their actual stats and everything?

03:23:57.635 --> 03:23:58.669
MATT: Yeah.

03:23:58.669 --> 03:23:59.781
ASHLY: Oh my god.

03:23:59.781 --> 03:24:01.937
MARISHA: The ones that are always in the books?

03:24:01.937 --> 03:24:03.242
MATT: In the books, yeah!

03:24:03.242 --> 03:24:04.706
ASHLY: That's amazing!

03:24:04.706 --> 03:24:08.123
MATT: The actual Pathfinder Iconic characters!

03:24:08.123 --> 03:24:09.442
MARISHA: We killed Pathfinder!

03:24:09.442 --> 03:24:11.193
ASHLY: Yay! We murdered it!

03:24:11.193 --> 03:24:13.519
MARISHA: These people, yeah!

03:24:13.519 --> 03:24:15.857
TALIESIN: I was prepared to go down in a blaze of
glory.

03:24:15.857 --> 03:24:17.464
ASHLY: Yeah, me too! I thought we were all
going to die.

03:24:17.464 --> 03:24:23.108
MATT: For those who weren't aware, the Attack on
Sandpoint is actually the very first encounter adventure

03:24:23.108 --> 03:24:30.516
in The Rise of the Runelords campaign setting and
adventure guide for Pathfinder. You guys played

03:24:30.516 --> 03:24:35.908
the other half of that battle. What's normally the
first fight for the heroes, they got slaughtered

03:24:35.908 --> 03:24:37.317
by five goblins.

03:24:37.317 --> 03:24:40.539
ASHLY: So this merry band of people came together,
are like, "We're going adventuring!" Their first

03:24:40.539 --> 03:24:44.425
day out, they fight a group of goblins that
beheaded all of them.

03:24:44.425 --> 03:24:48.316
IVAN: In an alternate dimension, we TPKed another
Pathfinder game.

03:24:48.316 --> 03:24:52.327
TALIESIN: Congratulations, we are the darkest
timeline.

03:24:52.327 --> 03:25:02.569
MARISHA: Somewhere, there's a whole new set of
gamers being like, "This RPG shit's bullshit. I

03:25:02.569 --> 03:25:06.739
"died at level two. It was stupid. I'm over it."

03:25:06.739 --> 03:25:08.877
MATT: Well done, guys.

03:25:08.877 --> 03:25:10.600
IVAN: Thank you, Matt!

03:25:10.600 --> 03:25:12.180
ASHLY: Thank you, Matt! Amazing!

03:25:12.180 --> 03:25:14.803
PHIL: I felt like I was in another world!

03:25:14.803 --> 03:25:22.284
MARISHA: So they get these cool little goblin
things, and this cool stuffies?

03:25:22.284 --> 03:25:27.311
IVAN: There's a lot that's in the big package.
It's all books, and all stuff.

03:25:27.311 --> 03:25:32.670
MATT: All these little goblin things are available
on the Paizo store, guys. The banks look awesome.

03:25:32.670 --> 03:25:33.821
IVAN: The banks are cool.

03:25:33.821 --> 03:25:37.173
MATT: It's good desk accessories.

03:25:37.173 --> 03:25:44.827
IVAN: As a sidebar statement, I would like to say
that even though 17k and Ivan breathes fire, I

03:25:44.827 --> 03:25:54.404
don't know if we hit 17k or not. Oh, we did? This
is not fortuitous. I will not actually light

03:25:54.404 --> 03:25:55.708
myself on fire.

03:25:55.708 --> 03:25:57.555
TALIESIN: Have you actually ever breathed fire
before?

03:25:57.555 --> 03:26:03.473
IVAN: Yeah! I do it a lot, but I'm not going to
sneeze fire and then light myself on fire.

03:26:03.473 --> 03:26:06.272
PHIL: Sneezing fire is different than breathing
fire.

03:26:06.272 --> 03:26:08.541
TALIESIN: Sneezing fire would blow my mind. I've
never seen that before.

03:26:08.541 --> 03:26:09.815
IVAN: Different orifices.

03:26:09.815 --> 03:26:12.364
MATT: This is Ivan breathing it, not Grizznak.

03:26:12.364 --> 03:26:18.847
PHIL: Grizznak really is lucky to be alive. He
literally died three times.

03:26:18.847 --> 03:26:21.368
IVAN: I actually was hoping that you guys would
leave me there.

03:26:21.368 --> 03:26:27.489
MARISHA: I debated. I was like, I'm chaotic evil.
Technically, I wouldn't. Well, you're my homie,

03:26:27.489 --> 03:26:29.047
it's fine.

03:26:29.047 --> 03:26:31.225
PHIL: If we had to carry you? No.

03:26:31.225 --> 03:26:36.495
IVAN: If you carried me, I would have expected you
to throw me in the stew to have for the rest of

03:26:36.495 --> 03:26:38.857
the evening with the boom-boom stone.

03:26:38.857 --> 03:26:45.059
MATT: Oh my god, that was delightfully ridiculous.
Well done, guys.

03:26:45.059 --> 03:26:47.634
PHIL: Whose dice are these?

03:26:47.634 --> 03:26:49.088
MARISHA: We got a winner?

03:26:49.088 --> 03:26:58.411
MATT: PacManWakkaWakka. Grand prize winner. You're
going to get a fantastic care package courtesy of

03:26:58.411 --> 03:27:04.321
Paizo that involves Pathfinder Core Rulebook,
Monster Codex, Inner Sea Races Book, Burnt

03:27:04.321 --> 03:27:08.392
Offerings Book, We Be Goblins, the goblin promo
figure, the challenge square flip mat, which you

03:27:08.392 --> 03:27:14.470
got to see right here, goblin bank, plush, and a
one-year subscription to Syrinscape. That is

03:27:14.470 --> 03:27:16.075
fantastic, congratulations!

03:27:16.075 --> 03:27:18.017
MARISHA: And a one-year subscription to
Syrinscape?

03:27:18.017 --> 03:27:18.978
MATT: Yeah!

03:27:18.978 --> 03:27:25.067
MARISHA: That was some good music. I really liked
the drum one. The tribal one.

03:27:25.067 --> 03:27:27.236
MATT: Great music tracks. You can customize your
own tracks.

03:27:27.236 --> 03:27:28.619
IVAN: The sewers were great.

03:27:28.619 --> 03:27:31.429
MARISHA: The screaming people were great.

03:27:31.429 --> 03:27:40.239
MATT: There was a bar brawl in case you guys used
a bar brawl as a way to get through. Here's the

03:27:40.239 --> 03:27:43.044
tavern brawl. Go ahead and hit that there.

03:27:43.044 --> 03:27:45.315
IVAN: Awesome.

03:27:45.315 --> 03:27:54.813
MATT: Dudes beating the crap out of each other.
You can put in glass shattering punches.

03:27:54.813 --> 03:27:59.532
IVAN: Syrinscape also has not just a fantasy
division, but they also have an entire sci-fi

03:27:59.532 --> 03:28:05.652
catalogue, too. I know we used it a bunch on the
TMNT.

03:28:05.652 --> 03:28:07.211
MATT: For the record.

03:28:07.211 --> 03:28:08.614
(Wilhelm scream)

03:28:08.614 --> 03:28:10.558
TALIESIN: Oh my god, they have a Wilhelm!

03:28:10.558 --> 03:28:19.512
MATT: Wilhelm is on the sound list there. You have
a dragon if you want to use it. It's the best bar

03:28:19.512 --> 03:28:24.225
brawl ever. Sad trombone, which we got to use
earlier.

03:28:24.225 --> 03:28:28.323
IVAN: All things you want while your players are
doing stupid things.

03:28:28.323 --> 03:28:33.603
MATT: It's really cool stuff. If you have spells,
like a fire spell, which you didn't get to hear

03:28:33.603 --> 03:28:36.230
over the music when you burst into flame last
time.

03:28:36.230 --> 03:28:37.883
MARISHA: Did you do it, though?

03:28:37.883 --> 03:28:39.249
MATT: Yeah.

03:28:39.249 --> 03:28:42.541
TALIESIN: This, by the way, is what an evening at
Matt Mercer's house is like. He's sitting going,

03:28:42.541 --> 03:28:44.900
"Look at this!" (trombone)

03:28:44.900 --> 03:28:46.465
MATT: I make the sounds happen!

03:28:46.465 --> 03:28:52.905
TALIESIN: This was Sunday evening, pretty much.
Add YouTube and that's pretty much it.

03:28:52.905 --> 03:28:57.974
MARISHA: Yeah, we don't do a lot when we have the
opportunity.

03:28:57.974 --> 03:29:05.447
IVAN: It was a pleasure being unconscious for most
of the battle. Thank you.

03:29:05.447 --> 03:29:07.361
MARISHA: You did so much early on.

03:29:07.361 --> 03:29:10.054
PHIL: You tried to talk us out of our mission.

03:29:10.054 --> 03:29:13.449
IVAN: I did so enjoy all of the wayward things.

03:29:13.449 --> 03:29:15.653
PHIL: That's not it!

03:29:15.653 --> 03:29:19.486
TALIESIN: Just think, you might have lived if you
hadn't taken that bramble damage. I just want you to

03:29:19.548 --> 03:29:26.161
live with that. Sleep like a baby tonight. I want
you to sleep like a baby.

03:29:26.161 --> 03:29:28.925
IVAN: That's going to keep me awake, you asshole.

03:29:28.925 --> 03:29:30.377
TALIESIN: You're welcome.

03:29:30.377 --> 03:29:32.243
IVAN: You know what? Suck it.

03:29:32.243 --> 03:29:33.432
TALIESIN: Live with it.

03:29:33.432 --> 03:29:37.046
PHIL: How much ass would we have kicked if &lt;i&gt;any&lt;/i&gt;
of the songs had worked?

03:29:37.046 --> 03:29:39.607
TALIESIN: I got the one.

03:29:39.607 --> 03:29:41.557
MATT: You got one.

03:29:41.557 --> 03:29:44.935
ASHLY: Thank god. That would have been really
depressing if none of the songs worked.

03:29:44.935 --> 03:29:46.550
TALIESIN: I roll really well.

03:29:46.550 --> 03:29:48.440
MARISHA: We all sang our song once.

03:29:48.440 --> 03:29:50.269
MATT: Everyone got to sing their song once, which
is cool.

03:29:50.269 --> 03:29:52.258
TALIESIN: I wrote mine on my lunch break today.

03:29:52.258 --> 03:29:58.608
MATT: You guys were awesome. Thank you guys so
much for watching. Thank you guys for playing. You

03:29:58.608 --> 03:30:03.029
guys should come Thursday at 7:00pm to see the
50th episode of Critical Role.

03:30:03.029 --> 03:30:05.824
TALIESIN: It's going to be crazy.

03:30:05.824 --> 03:30:10.205
IVAN: Feel free to stick around next Monday.

03:30:10.205 --> 03:30:11.270
MATT: Every Monday!

03:30:11.270 --> 03:30:13.921
PHIL: Every Monday in the week?

03:30:13.921 --> 03:30:21.198
IVAN: Every Monday, and it sucks because I won't
be there next week because of Tabletop and for the

03:30:21.198 --> 03:30:28.107
next three weeks, but you'll see we'll be playing
Kick Ass and Chew Bubblegum next week. It's a fun

03:30:28.107 --> 03:30:35.060
little one-off. You have two actions. You can
either chew bubblegum or you can kick ass.

03:30:35.060 --> 03:30:36.871
MARISHA: That's fantastic.

03:30:36.871 --> 03:30:40.108
IVAN: If you ever run out of bubblegum, you can
only kick ass.

03:30:40.108 --> 03:30:44.573
MARISHA: What happens if you run out of kicking
ass?

03:30:44.573 --> 03:30:46.692
IVAN: You can't ever run out of kicking ass.

03:30:46.692 --> 03:30:50.926
PHIL: There's always ass to kick. But bubblegum
is finite.

03:30:50.926 --> 03:30:59.089
IVAN: If you ever want to explore the weird and
wacky RPGs and explore small campaigns, not unlike

03:30:59.089 --> 03:31:02.415
this scenario in little chunks, tune in Monday.

03:31:02.415 --> 03:31:03.945
MATT: You should run a Hole game sometimes.

03:31:03.945 --> 03:31:06.451
IVAN: What's that? Hole's on my list.

03:31:06.451 --> 03:31:07.755
TALIESIN: I love Hole.

03:31:07.755 --> 03:31:13.354
MATT: He got me the Hole books for my birthday a
couple years ago. And all the expansions.

03:31:13.354 --> 03:31:15.120
IVAN: We also want to play Tune. Do you know
Tune?

03:31:15.120 --> 03:31:16.191
TALIESIN: I don't know Tune.

03:31:16.191 --> 03:31:17.222
MATT: You don't know Tune?

03:31:17.222 --> 03:31:18.462
TALIESIN: Oh, Tune! Yes.

03:31:18.462 --> 03:31:22.719
IVAN: Tune's basically Saturday morning cartoon
show, the role-playing game.

03:31:22.719 --> 03:31:25.271
TALIESIN: I've been trying to dig up Tofos for
you, too.

03:31:25.271 --> 03:31:27.494
MARISHA: Like Who Framed Roger Rabbit, the RPG?

03:31:27.494 --> 03:31:28.525
IVAN: Basically.

03:31:28.525 --> 03:31:29.799
ASHLY: That sounds really cool.

03:31:29.799 --> 03:31:32.660
IVAN: There's a lot of really fun systems out
there. A lot of them don't get a lot of attention

03:31:32.660 --> 03:31:37.820
because they're either independently published or
whatever, but we find them and have a good time

03:31:37.820 --> 03:31:38.886
with them.

03:31:38.886 --> 03:31:40.219
MATT: That's what No Survivors is about.

03:31:40.219 --> 03:31:51.195
IVAN: It's called No Survivors because characters
can die and it's okay. Anyway. Thank you, Matt.
