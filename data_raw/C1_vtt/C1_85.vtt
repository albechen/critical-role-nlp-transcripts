00:00:01.179 --> 00:00:04.655
MATT: Hello everyone, and welcome to tonight's
episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us

00:00:04.655 --> 00:00:07.985
nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play
Dungeons and Dragons--

00:00:07.985 --> 00:00:09.389
ALL: (cheering)

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:11.407
MATT: -- you assholes.

00:00:11.407 --> 00:00:12.655
MARISHA: Der 'n' Der!

00:00:12.655 --> 00:00:17.010
MATT: Welcome. Tonight should be an interesting
episode, but, before we begin, let's go ahead and

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.959
get through our announcements for the evening! So,
welcome, and, first and foremost, tonight we are

00:00:20.959 --> 00:00:23.864
sponsored by our friends at Loot Crate.

00:00:23.864 --> 00:00:26.209
ALL: (cheering) Loot Crate!

00:00:26.209 --> 00:00:28.648
MATT: Thank you, Loot Crate, for being amazing
sponsors.

00:00:28.648 --> 00:00:30.206
Sam, did you want to tell us a little
about--

00:00:30.206 --> 00:00:32.204
SAM: Okay! I haven't done this in a while,
so I'm falling back on

00:00:32.204 --> 00:00:37.898
an old crutch, an old beloved character--

00:00:37.945 --> 00:00:41.658
Rhodey Slater is back to do another round--

00:00:41.658 --> 00:00:43.439
MATT: (laughing) Oh my god.

00:00:43.439 --> 00:00:45.258
SAM: Gotta get in character.

00:00:45.258 --> 00:00:47.846
(in surfer voice)
Yo-ho-ho, it's me, Rhodey Slater, with another

00:00:47.846 --> 00:00:53.949
message from our sponsor, Loot Crate. Whether
you're dropping in on a party wave in Uluwatu or

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:59.623
even Tamarindo, you won't look like a paddle-puss
if you haul your tres gnarly gear from El Crate-o

00:00:59.623 --> 00:01:05.856
del Loot-o. This month's theme is Build,
featuring sick brands like Power Rangers,

00:01:05.856 --> 00:01:11.935
hang ten; Batman, wax it up; Lego, mondo
bitchin'; and Tetris, shaka.

00:01:11.935 --> 00:01:13.568
(all laugh)

00:01:13.568 --> 00:01:15.945
SAM: So don't get raked over
by a wiper, point your nose to

00:01:15.945 --> 00:01:22.548
Lootcrate.com/CriticalRole and use promo code
"criticalrole" for 10% off your subscription.

00:01:22.548 --> 00:01:29.303
You'll be radder than Tom Curren nailing a 360
air reverse rodeo. You'll be cooler than a tight

00:01:29.303 --> 00:01:34.580
on-shore breeze at Malibu. You'll be more
authentic than a sad voice actor searching for

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:37.604
surfing terms on Yahoo Answers at 5 pm--

00:01:37.604 --> 00:01:38.773
(all laugh)

00:01:38.773 --> 00:01:42.683
SAM: -- when he should be really spending more
quality time with his children, as their youthful

00:01:42.683 --> 00:01:49.672
lives pass by without their father, precious
moments ticking away until one day they're adults,

00:01:49.672 --> 00:01:55.171
and you're standing at their wedding, thinking,
"Oh my god, I missed so much, I missed so very

00:01:55.171 --> 00:01:59.915
much, and for what? A Loot Crate ad?"

00:01:59.915 --> 00:02:02.174
Anyway, ride that tube and subscribe today,

00:02:02.174 --> 00:02:03.881
(shouting) bonzai!

00:02:03.881 --> 00:02:06.337
(all laugh and cheer)

00:02:06.337 --> 00:02:11.490
TRAVIS: I mean, he's a whole new echelon.
It's a whole new--

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:13.890
TALIESIN: You just Inception'd a Loot Crate ad.

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.413
MATT: Thank you for that!

00:02:18.413 --> 00:02:19.625
TRAVIS: Incredible!

00:02:19.625 --> 00:02:20.488
MATT: Sam.

00:02:20.488 --> 00:02:24.795
MARISHA: You took, like, a failed Californian
sketch and turned it into Oscar-winning material.

00:02:24.795 --> 00:02:26.754
MATT: That is, thank you very much.

00:02:26.754 --> 00:02:28.992
LAURA: It hurts, it hurts.

00:02:28.992 --> 00:02:31.710
LIAM: I didn't know Rhodey's, Rhodey's a father,
that's an interesting development.

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:32.389
SAM: Yeah.

00:02:32.389 --> 00:02:33.439
MATT: Indeed.

00:02:33.439 --> 00:02:34.592
SAM: Many. Many.

00:02:34.592 --> 00:02:36.619
MATT: Just a heads-up, guys, we've done a couple
of these and we're going to do a couple more of

00:02:36.619 --> 00:02:40.173
these upcoming For Honor streams, where a few of
us are going to be guesting on here for a number

00:02:40.173 --> 00:02:44.028
of hours to play For Honor and beat the shit out
of each other and other people, as various

00:02:44.028 --> 00:02:49.471
historical warriors of old. And then a number of
us are actually, I think, a voice in the game.

00:02:49.471 --> 00:02:51.041
TRAVIS: Yeah!

00:02:51.041 --> 00:02:57.092
MATT: But yeah. So tomorrow, joining the Nerdist
team from 9 am to 12 noon Pacific Time, we have

00:02:57.092 --> 00:02:58.382
Liam and Travis--

00:02:58.382 --> 00:02:58.951
TRAVIS: Woo!

00:02:58.951 --> 00:02:59.528
LIAM: Tarvis!

00:02:59.528 --> 00:03:04.681
MATT: --to jump in on there, and then, on
Saturday, from 12 noon to 3 pm, that's going to be

00:03:04.681 --> 00:03:08.258
Travis, Taliesin, Sam, Marisha, and myself on
there--

00:03:08.258 --> 00:03:09.604
MARISHA: Hey-oh.

00:03:09.604 --> 00:03:11.015
MATT:-- all playing the game, getting crazy.

00:03:11.015 --> 00:03:11.843
LAURA: Woah. Really?

00:03:11.843 --> 00:03:12.356
TRAVIS: Yep.

00:03:12.356 --> 00:03:13.422
LAURA: Why aren't I there?

00:03:13.422 --> 00:03:14.326
TRAVIS: 'Cuz you suck.

00:03:14.326 --> 00:03:15.053
LAURA: Oh man.

00:03:15.053 --> 00:03:15.763
LIAM: He's right.

00:03:15.763 --> 00:03:16.699
LAURA: I know it!

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:19.108
LIAM: He would know. He would know.

00:03:19.108 --> 00:03:21.777
MATT: (laughs) So yeah, it'll be here on the
Twitch, check it out, I'm really excited,

00:03:21.777 --> 00:03:24.740
I haven't played the game yet? And everyone I
know who's talked about has said it's ridiculously

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:29.841
fun and amazing. It's like, the upgrade of Dark
Souls combat and I'm really excited about it.

00:03:29.841 --> 00:03:32.365
TRAVIS: I have to, like, show up an hour early and
learn how to play, or we're going to get.

00:03:32.365 --> 00:03:34.037
We're going to get killed a lot.

00:03:34.037 --> 00:03:36.669
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm probably going to.

00:03:36.669 --> 00:03:38.297
TRAVIS: We've got to work on our death sounds.

00:03:38.297 --> 00:03:40.844
LIAM: What, I'm Leet, man, you're going down,
and stuff.

00:03:40.844 --> 00:03:41.802
TRAVIS: (belches)

00:03:41.802 --> 00:03:42.671
LAURA: Leet!

00:03:42.671 --> 00:03:44.158
MATT: (accented voice) Going down.

00:03:44.158 --> 00:03:48.686
TRAVIS: No. No. You... are the one falling,
in the opposite direction of up.

00:03:48.686 --> 00:03:51.327
LIAM: (in Christopher Walken voice) It's important
to point out, we're not doing Walken anymore--

00:03:51.327 --> 00:03:52.440
(all laugh)

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:56.080
LIAM: --we're doing our impression of Troy,
doing an impression of Nolan doing Walken.

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:58.081
MATT: Oh, wow.

00:03:58.081 --> 00:03:58.961
TRAVIS: It's a quad lay-up.

00:03:58.961 --> 00:03:59.628
MATT: The chain goes deep.

00:03:59.628 --> 00:04:00.485
LAURA: Yeah, it does.

00:04:00.485 --> 00:04:01.748
TRAVIS: (Walken voice) Quad. Lay-up.

00:04:01.748 --> 00:04:02.849
LAURA: Woah. Just woah. (laughs)

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:07.144
LIAM: I don't even know what Walken sounds like,
it's come through a daisy-chain of assholes.

00:04:07.144 --> 00:04:16.176
MATT: It's true, it's true. That's our next shirt.
"Daisy Chain of Assholes." I'm okay with that.

00:04:16.176 --> 00:04:18.297
TRAVIS: Critical Role: It's About Scientology--

00:04:18.297 --> 00:04:20.097
MATT: Also, don't google that phrase!

00:04:20.097 --> 00:04:21.495
TRAVIS: -- and a Daisy Chain of Assholes.

00:04:21.495 --> 00:04:24.037
MATT: All right! Next up, we have (quieter) me,
breaking my pen. Uh--

00:04:24.037 --> 00:04:25.559
LAURA: Oh, no.

00:04:25.559 --> 00:04:26.434
MATT: April 1st!

00:04:26.434 --> 00:04:27.456
TRAVIS: April 1st!

00:04:27.456 --> 00:04:28.459
MATT: WonderCon!

00:04:28.459 --> 00:04:29.563
TRAVIS: WonderCON!

00:04:29.563 --> 00:04:31.788
MATT: Save the date. We have--

00:04:31.788 --> 00:04:33.322
SAM: We're allowed to say the date now?

00:04:33.322 --> 00:04:37.957
MATT: We do now. That's all the information we
have so far, but April 1st, WonderCon. Critical

00:04:37.957 --> 00:04:40.170
Role and Talks Machina live, in their--

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:41.534
LAURA: Be there or be squared!

00:04:41.534 --> 00:04:42.687
MATT: -- big room, it's gonna be good.

00:04:42.687 --> 00:04:43.423
TRAVIS: Anaheim.

00:04:43.423 --> 00:04:44.581
MARISHA: Big room, did I say square?

00:04:44.581 --> 00:04:45.959
SAM: It is not an epic April Fools' Joke--

00:04:45.959 --> 00:04:46.523
MATT: No.

00:04:46.523 --> 00:04:47.433
SAM: -- this is really happening.

00:04:47.433 --> 00:04:48.146
TRAVIS: It's really happening.

00:04:48.146 --> 00:04:49.381
TALIESIN: It's really happening.

00:04:49.381 --> 00:04:49.865
SAM: Okay.

00:04:49.865 --> 00:04:51.918
TRAVIS: And it's going to be a big, big,
rowdy room. So if you're like, "Aw, I don't want

00:04:51.918 --> 00:04:54.972
to go, there's not going to be any seats." 
There gon' be seats.

00:04:54.972 --> 00:04:55.620
MATT: There's plenty of seats.

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:56.295
LIAM: Yeah, it's--

00:04:56.295 --> 00:04:57.403
TRAVIS: Bring it, if you can.

00:04:57.403 --> 00:04:58.801
LIAM: --It's April Fools', we're not going to be
there.

00:04:58.801 --> 00:04:59.843
TRAVIS: I can say that.

00:04:59.843 --> 00:05:00.740
SAM: You know what?

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:01.523
LIAM: We're not going to do that.

00:05:01.523 --> 00:05:04.597
SAM: I will promise that I will play at least one
April Fools' joke

00:05:04.597 --> 00:05:08.355
on one of you, during that panel.

00:05:08.355 --> 00:05:08.981
LAURA: Ooh.

00:05:08.981 --> 00:05:09.898
TALIESIN: I'm excited by this.

00:05:09.898 --> 00:05:11.667
LAURA: Can I vote for Brian?

00:05:11.667 --> 00:05:12.289
LIAM: I'm not.

00:05:12.289 --> 00:05:13.348
SAM: Sure, of course.

00:05:13.348 --> 00:05:14.340
TALIESIN: I think that's a great idea.

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:15.722
TRAVIS: He's not listening to this right now.

00:05:15.722 --> 00:05:18.298
MATT: We should have a poll in the community for
which member of the team Sam gets to prank.

00:05:18.298 --> 00:05:19.585
(all laugh)

00:05:19.585 --> 00:05:21.582
MATT: Don't actually do that, please. 'Cause we
all know that's going to be--

00:05:21.582 --> 00:05:24.635
TALIESIN: I'm a big fan of Brian, I have a feeling
that's a good bet.

00:05:24.635 --> 00:05:25.429
MATT: Also!

00:05:25.429 --> 00:05:27.192
MARISHA: Man, we're being so transparent.

00:05:27.192 --> 00:05:29.185
MATT: Isn't it, though? All right! Next up--

00:05:29.185 --> 00:05:30.299
LIAM: Wow.

00:05:30.299 --> 00:05:32.017
MATT: Signal Boost has returned. Marisha,
if you want to talk about that.

00:05:32.017 --> 00:05:33.297
MARISHA: It has returned--

00:05:33.297 --> 00:05:34.351
TRAVIS: Oh, snap!

00:05:34.351 --> 00:05:40.629
MARISHA: Oh, my goodness, you guys! The amazing
Darin De Paul, already. He kicked off the season.

00:05:40.629 --> 00:05:41.758
TRAVIS: DDP!

00:05:41.758 --> 00:05:42.535
LIAM: So good.

00:05:42.535 --> 00:05:43.744
TALIESIN: It was crazy.

00:05:43.744 --> 00:05:45.649
MARISHA: Yes. Yeah, he kind of set the bar really
high.

00:05:45.649 --> 00:05:46.312
TALIESIN: It was crazy.

00:05:46.312 --> 00:05:47.115
MATT: He's awesome.

00:05:47.115 --> 00:05:50.307
MARISHA: You guys know Darin as the voice of
Reinhardt from Overwatch,

00:05:50.307 --> 00:05:53.120
and many other things. But--

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:55.152
MATT: He's also the main villain, Ardyn,
in Final Fantasy XV

00:05:55.152 --> 00:05:56.370
and a bunch of other games. Super talented--

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:57.774
LAURA: He's blowing up! He's in everything now!

00:05:57.774 --> 00:05:58.513
MATT: He's incredible.

00:05:58.513 --> 00:05:59.369
MARISHA: He's great.

00:05:59.369 --> 00:06:00.348
SAM: I don't care for him.

00:06:00.348 --> 00:06:02.692
(All laugh)

00:06:02.692 --> 00:06:06.814
TRAVIS: I think he's rude. And he smells funny.

00:06:06.814 --> 00:06:07.488
MATT: There you go.

00:06:07.488 --> 00:06:10.637
SAM: He didn't want to come on my show, Siggle
Boost.

00:06:10.637 --> 00:06:11.593
MARISHA: (laughs)

00:06:11.593 --> 00:06:12.748
TRAVIS: Siggle Boost?

00:06:12.748 --> 00:06:13.644
SAM: Siggle Boost.

00:06:13.644 --> 00:06:15.633
MARISHA: Wow, I haven't heard of that one.

00:06:15.633 --> 00:06:17.058
TALIESIN: Do you guys just like draw weird
circles?

00:06:17.058 --> 00:06:18.024
SAM: Yup. Yeah.

00:06:18.024 --> 00:06:19.147
TALIESIN: Right, okay. I was just checking.

00:06:19.147 --> 00:06:20.526
MATT: And people correct you for mispronouncing
it.

00:06:20.526 --> 00:06:21.742
LAURA: It's called Sigil Boost.

00:06:21.742 --> 00:06:22.566
MARISHA: Sigil Boost.

00:06:22.566 --> 00:06:23.642
SAM: That's true, that's true.

00:06:23.642 --> 00:06:25.505
LIAM: Let's run the GIF (hard g) of that now,
please.

00:06:25.505 --> 00:06:26.646
TALIESIN: It's pronounced siggle.

00:06:26.646 --> 00:06:28.694
MARISHA: Yes, it's back. You should watch it. Yup.

00:06:28.694 --> 00:06:29.237
TALIESIN: Yeah.

00:06:29.237 --> 00:06:30.053
MARISHA: People.

00:06:30.053 --> 00:06:31.154
MATT: Yeah, Erika Ishii just did hers--

00:06:31.154 --> 00:06:31.810
MARISHA: On Tuesdays.

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:33.158
MATT: --and then Amy Dallen's up next, right?

00:06:33.158 --> 00:06:34.858
MARISHA: Amy Dallen is up next and--

00:06:34.858 --> 00:06:35.604
MATT: Awesome.

00:06:35.604 --> 00:06:37.046
MARISHA: Yeah. It's good people coming up.

00:06:37.046 --> 00:06:38.611
TALIESIN: Yeah, you drain Erika Ishii's blood.
It's pretty great.

00:06:38.611 --> 00:06:40.023
MARISHA: Yes. We do. Yeah.

00:06:40.023 --> 00:06:41.695
LIAM: Yeah, but you can only do it once, though.

00:06:41.695 --> 00:06:42.363
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:06:42.363 --> 00:06:43.455
TALIESIN: It's a great trick. You can only do it
once.

00:06:43.455 --> 00:06:44.962
MATT: Laura, do you have a merch update?

00:06:44.962 --> 00:06:46.364
LAURA: Do I? Do I? Do-

00:06:46.364 --> 00:06:47.495
TRAVIS: Do I?

00:06:47.495 --> 00:06:48.484
MATT: It's on the list.

00:06:48.484 --> 00:06:50.043
LAURA: We watched Galaxy Quest last night.

00:06:50.043 --> 00:06:51.079
TRAVIS: So great.

00:06:51.079 --> 00:06:55.767
LAURA: So good. Again. For, like, the hundredth
time. You know, I mean, there's merch in the store

00:06:55.767 --> 00:07:00.095
right now. These dice bags that I'm holding in my
hand. I literally just happened to be holding it

00:07:00.095 --> 00:07:05.883
as you asked me that, which is crazy. There's a
very small amount of them left, I happen to know.

00:07:05.883 --> 00:07:07.725
SAM: In the hundreds? In the fifties? In the
tens?

00:07:07.725 --> 00:07:08.736
TALIESIN: Baker's dozen.

00:07:08.736 --> 00:07:10.455
LAURA: In the barely hundreds.

00:07:10.455 --> 00:07:11.161
SAM: Wow.

00:07:11.161 --> 00:07:11.910
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:13.316
TRAVIS: It's a lot.

00:07:13.316 --> 00:07:14.563
MARISHA: They went fast.

00:07:14.563 --> 00:07:17.699
LAURA: Which, you know, could be a lot or
couldn't. Depending on if you want them.

00:07:17.699 --> 00:07:19.015
SAM: Wow.

00:07:19.015 --> 00:07:22.252
LAURA: There's also shirts! And hats! And patches
and--

00:07:22.252 --> 00:07:24.112
MATT: (singing) Things, oh God!

00:07:24.112 --> 00:07:26.197
LAURA: -- other stuff coming up that I'm real
excited about,

00:07:26.197 --> 00:07:27.808
and I'll show it to you when it's here.

00:07:27.808 --> 00:07:29.046
TRAVIS: Yep.

00:07:29.046 --> 00:07:30.550
MATT: (clicking dice) Such a beautiful sound.

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:32.209
TRAVIS: (sniffing) Allergies. (groans)

00:07:32.209 --> 00:07:33.318
TALIESIN: You watched Galaxy Quest.

00:07:33.318 --> 00:07:34.319
LAURA: Yeah.

00:07:34.319 --> 00:07:36.136
TRAVIS: You don't need that-- he can have that
many. You have too many.

00:07:36.136 --> 00:07:37.669
TALIESIN: You know they have the dubbed version of
the alien language on the DVD?

00:07:37.669 --> 00:07:38.543
LAURA: No!

00:07:38.543 --> 00:07:40.736
TALIESIN: (alien noises) The whole movie,
the entire movie-- You can watch it, if you're

00:07:40.736 --> 00:07:41.893
drunk enough.

00:07:41.893 --> 00:07:43.140
LAURA: It's just so good.

00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:43.938
MARISHA: (laughs)

00:07:43.938 --> 00:07:45.473
MATT: That's pretty great. All right!

00:07:45.473 --> 00:07:45.918
LIAM: I'm ready.

00:07:45.918 --> 00:07:49.364
MATT: Anything else anyone wants to talk about? Or
are we good? I think we're good.

00:07:49.364 --> 00:07:50.073
TRAVIS: We're good.

00:07:50.073 --> 00:07:50.849
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:07:50.849 --> 00:07:53.109
MATT: So we're going to hop in, and start off
tonight's episode of--

00:07:53.109 --> 00:07:53.794
LAURA: Oh God.

00:07:53.794 --> 00:07:54.863
MATT: Critical Role.

00:07:54.863 --> 00:07:56.536
(All cheer)

00:07:56.536 --> 00:07:57.289
MARISHA: That's right.

00:07:57.289 --> 00:09:27.568
[opening credits]

00:09:27.568 --> 00:09:29.140
MATT: Hello everyone, and welcome back.

00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:29.790
(all laugh)

00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:30.681
TRAVIS: Well done.

00:09:30.681 --> 00:09:34.797
MATT: So, to get you up to speed with our current
story: Vox Machina, having just completed the

00:09:34.797 --> 00:09:39.788
destruction of the Chroma Conclave, a scourge of
ancient chromatic dragons that have terrorized the

00:09:39.788 --> 00:09:47.838
countryside. They are victorious, yet in the
process lost a couple of lives. Percy returned and

00:09:47.838 --> 00:09:51.975
Scanlan, his lifeless body brought back to
Whitestone. They completed the ritual correctly,

00:09:51.975 --> 00:09:57.787
and he came to life; however, he remains
unconscious in a pseudo-coma. They left him in

00:09:57.787 --> 00:10:04.464
Whitestone, hopefully to recover. While beginning
to finish up some of their last business they've

00:10:04.464 --> 00:10:10.662
been unable to with the current rush of this
current arc. They made a journey to Vasselheim,

00:10:10.662 --> 00:10:15.968
where they walked through the Abundant Terrace
and into the Birthheart itself, the temple of

00:10:15.968 --> 00:10:27.760
Melora within Vasselheim, spoke with one of the
various worshippers there, and buried a box of

00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:30.271
ashes, apparently, of Senokir's wife--

00:10:30.271 --> 00:10:31.673
MARISHA: "Apparently"

00:10:31.673 --> 00:10:35.481
MATT: --as a thank you for when you guys journeyed
and met him in the City of Brass on the Fire

00:10:35.481 --> 00:10:41.758
Elemental Plane. Upon doing so, you then began to
scatter about the city to do some business.

00:10:41.758 --> 00:10:45.398
One of the elements of which: Grog Strongjaw,
along with Pike, made their way to the Trial

00:10:45.398 --> 00:10:53.399
Forge, which is the Kord section of the city.
Returning to the Trial Forge, the temple to Kord,

00:10:53.399 --> 00:11:02.748
and upon walking to the center of the strangely
empty temple structure, you saw, down in a once

00:11:02.748 --> 00:11:09.623
previously traversed sandpit, there stood
Earthbreaker Groon, the high priest of Kord,

00:11:09.623 --> 00:11:11.822
who then turned to you--

00:11:11.822 --> 00:11:12.943
TRAVIS: My palms are really wet.

00:11:12.943 --> 00:11:13.779
LAURA: (laughs)

00:11:13.779 --> 00:11:21.278
MATT: --and asked you to "show him what you had
learned." After slamming his feet into the sand

00:11:21.278 --> 00:11:27.230
and preparing himself for conflict, he beckons you
towards him. And that is where we left off. So--

00:11:27.230 --> 00:11:29.078
LAURA: Oh god, oh god, oh god.

00:11:29.078 --> 00:11:32.979
MATT: --as you're standing up there on the edge of
this pit, Groon just stands there with his hand

00:11:32.979 --> 00:11:36.026
beckoning towards you.

00:11:36.026 --> 00:11:42.871
TRAVIS: I reach into my Bag of Holding, and I pull
out a small drawing of the letter "G". This.

00:11:42.871 --> 00:11:47.460
This is what I have learn-- That's not it.

00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:53.671
That's not what I wanted. And I take out
the Dwarven Thrower and I jump into the sandpit.

00:11:53.671 --> 00:11:59.165
MATT: All righty. (jumping sound) (impact thud)
There, as you land in the sand, the bottoms of

00:11:59.165 --> 00:12:05.329
your boots sinking but a couple of inches into the
soft surface. Pike gets ready to leap down after

00:12:05.329 --> 00:12:09.907
and Groon puts his hand up. "No...."

00:12:09.907 --> 00:12:10.793
TRAVIS: Oh, shit.

00:12:10.793 --> 00:12:12.593
MATT: This fight is for us.

00:12:12.593 --> 00:12:13.716
LAURA: Oh, god.

00:12:13.716 --> 00:12:16.876
LAURA: Yeah, we're here, we're watching it,
right?

00:12:16.876 --> 00:12:18.561
MATT: You guys didn't say if you were catching up
with them last time.

00:12:18.561 --> 00:12:20.128
LAURA: Yeah, we said we came in the temple with
them.

00:12:20.128 --> 00:12:21.129
MARISHA: Uh, no, we're totally watching this.

00:12:21.129 --> 00:12:22.236
TALIESIN: We're here, we're here.

00:12:22.236 --> 00:12:24.618
MATT: So then you guys rush in afterward,
hoping that--

00:12:24.618 --> 00:12:26.524
Morpheus is fighting Neo, you guys--

00:12:26.524 --> 00:12:27.812
(all laugh)

00:12:27.812 --> 00:12:36.630
MATT: You all rush in on the outskirts here to
watch. I'll put you in over here to keep an

00:12:36.630 --> 00:12:41.046
eye on the sidelines. Grog, I need you to roll
initiative.

00:12:41.046 --> 00:12:42.522
LAURA: Oh my god!

00:12:42.522 --> 00:12:43.651
TRAVIS: (blows raspberry)

00:12:43.651 --> 00:12:44.661
SAM: Big roll, big roll.

00:12:44.661 --> 00:12:46.316
MARISHA: Big roll! Big money, no whammies.

00:12:46.316 --> 00:12:48.124
LIAM: Now we attack on the count of three.

00:12:48.124 --> 00:12:49.381
TRAVIS: I get advantage on my (mumbles)

00:12:49.381 --> 00:12:50.164
TALIESIN: Jenga.

00:12:50.164 --> 00:12:50.842
LIAM: Get 'im.

00:12:50.842 --> 00:12:51.525
TRAVIS: That's shit.

00:12:51.525 --> 00:12:52.242
LAURA: God, oh god.

00:12:52.242 --> 00:12:52.973
MARISHA: Come on, come on.

00:12:52.973 --> 00:12:53.911
TRAVIS: That-- that's one worse.

00:12:53.911 --> 00:12:54.597
TRAVIS: Five!

00:12:54.597 --> 00:12:55.520
LIAM: Oh!

00:12:55.520 --> 00:12:56.456
MATT: You're going second.

00:12:56.456 --> 00:12:59.369
TRAVIS: Hey! You can go away.

00:12:59.369 --> 00:13:00.730
LAURA: (laughs) You're in jail.

00:13:00.730 --> 00:13:02.756
MARISHA: You know, second has its advantages
sometimes.

00:13:02.756 --> 00:13:03.637
MATT: (clears throat) So.

00:13:03.637 --> 00:13:04.354
MARISHA: Sometimes.

00:13:04.354 --> 00:13:05.068
TRAVIS: Mm-hm.

00:13:05.068 --> 00:13:07.934
MATT: As you land and ready yourself with the
hammer at the side, knowing that all of your

00:13:07.934 --> 00:13:14.691
friends are up on the outer edges of this watching
you, you look up at Groon, who just, his hands at

00:13:14.691 --> 00:13:18.900
the ready, puts them down at his sides and
just.... (slow steps)

00:13:18.900 --> 00:13:19.838
TRAVIS: Awesome.

00:13:19.838 --> 00:13:27.925
MATT: Just walks up towards you... And just stands
there. Your turn.

00:13:27.925 --> 00:13:30.586
SAM: Like a matador.

00:13:30.586 --> 00:13:38.811
TRAVIS: What a dick move! What a dick move! Right.
(clears throat) I, uh. I bow.

00:13:38.811 --> 00:13:41.640
SAM: Oh!

00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:48.201
TRAVIS: And say... Kord's strength be with you.
And I smash the Titanstone Knuckles together.

00:13:48.250 --> 00:13:52.092
MATT: All righty! (laughs) Off to a start.

00:13:52.092 --> 00:13:53.592
SAM: (sound of impact)

00:13:53.592 --> 00:13:55.065
LAURA: (whispers) Oh my god.

00:13:55.065 --> 00:13:56.399
I wish we had popcorn!

00:13:56.399 --> 00:14:00.582
MARISHA: Oh, yeah. Is
there popcorn in the studio?

00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:01.780
DENISE: (off screen) No.

00:14:01.780 --> 00:14:02.795
LAURA and MARISHA: Damn it!

00:14:02.795 --> 00:14:04.007
MARISHA: Damn it, Denise.

00:14:04.007 --> 00:14:04.961
TALIESIN and LAURA: (laugh)

00:14:04.961 --> 00:14:05.790
DENISE: (off screen) Sorry!

00:14:05.790 --> 00:14:07.355
(all laugh)

00:14:07.355 --> 00:14:10.684
MARISHA: Always the bearer of bad news, that one.

00:14:10.684 --> 00:14:11.557
MATT: All right.

00:14:11.557 --> 00:14:13.877
TALIESIN: Don't say her name three times,
then your rolls won't come true.

00:14:13.877 --> 00:14:24.429
TRAVIS: I would like to move backwards three
squares.

00:14:24.429 --> 00:14:25.614
MATT: Okay.

00:14:25.614 --> 00:14:27.984
TRAVIS: That's my turn.

00:14:27.984 --> 00:14:32.004
MATT: All right. On his turn he stands there.

00:14:32.004 --> 00:14:32.819
LAURA: Ahh!

00:14:32.819 --> 00:14:33.971
MATT: He stares right at you.

00:14:33.971 --> 00:14:34.826
TRAVIS: Fucking knew it!

00:14:34.826 --> 00:14:35.716
MATT: Arms at the side--

00:14:35.716 --> 00:14:37.006
TRAVIS: What is-- It's a test already!

00:14:37.006 --> 00:14:38.238
MARISHA: Waiting for you to go first?

00:14:38.238 --> 00:14:42.522
TRAVIS: I hate the SATs! I hate Scantrons,
I hate number two pencils, I hate all of it!

00:14:42.522 --> 00:14:43.916
(all laugh)

00:14:43.916 --> 00:14:48.111
LIAM: Don't blink, don't blink. Roll with it,
player.

00:14:48.111 --> 00:14:50.420
TRAVIS: MM-hm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

00:14:50.420 --> 00:14:51.110
MARISHA: It's totally--

00:14:51.110 --> 00:14:55.521
TRAVIS: I start in that same distance from him,
the same radial distance, I start walking to my

00:14:55.521 --> 00:15:04.097
right. My full speed.

00:15:04.097 --> 00:15:05.680
MATT: Okay.

00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:07.239
TRAVIS: That's my turn.

00:15:07.239 --> 00:15:14.736
MATT: He turns with you as you move and just
rights himself and stares at you. Your turn.

00:15:14.736 --> 00:15:16.411
(all laugh)

00:15:16.411 --> 00:15:17.717
SAM: Worst chess game ever.

00:15:17.717 --> 00:15:18.763
LAURA: I know, right?

00:15:18.763 --> 00:15:20.113
LIAM: Smash cut to two hours later.

00:15:20.113 --> 00:15:21.011
(all laugh)

00:15:21.011 --> 00:15:22.066
MATT: I know.

00:15:22.066 --> 00:15:22.839
TRAVIS: All right. Okay.

00:15:22.839 --> 00:15:25.340
SAM: "What do you want me to do!"

00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:27.663
LAURA: "Are you hungry? I'm kind of hungry."

00:15:27.663 --> 00:15:31.484
TRAVIS: I would like to rage.

00:15:31.484 --> 00:15:34.312
MATT: Okay. (woosh) So--

00:15:34.312 --> 00:15:42.831
TRAVIS: And I do so by taking the...dwarven
thrower and smashing it against my chest.

00:15:42.831 --> 00:15:44.680
And then I chuck it at him.

00:15:44.680 --> 00:15:50.367
MATT: All right. As you slam it into your chest,
you can feel the impact, and there's that brief

00:15:50.367 --> 00:15:55.642
sharp bit of pain as the metal clashes against the
muscle, slamming against the bone and your rib

00:15:55.642 --> 00:15:59.913
cage. And that pain just kind of shoots through
you like exciting electricity and you harness the

00:15:59.913 --> 00:16:04.672
pain as your eyes blur for a moment as you feel
the rage overtake you, your muscles flexing and

00:16:04.672 --> 00:16:10.188
tensing and with that fury now flowing through
your body, you take the hammer. I need you to go

00:16:10.188 --> 00:16:12.084
ahead and make a wisdom saving throw.

00:16:12.084 --> 00:16:13.279
SAM: Oh no.

00:16:13.279 --> 00:16:14.313
LAURA: Oh shit.

00:16:14.313 --> 00:16:15.907
TRAVIS: (whispers) I knew it. (louder) I mean,
I didn't know it.

00:16:15.907 --> 00:16:18.458
SAM: Oh no.

00:16:18.458 --> 00:16:20.573
TRAVIS: Which is a minus two, right?

00:16:20.573 --> 00:16:22.703
MATT: Yes.

00:16:22.703 --> 00:16:25.153
TRAVIS: That's a six.

00:16:25.153 --> 00:16:29.935
MATT: As you go to throw, the strength leaves your
arm and it just hangs limp at the side.

00:16:29.935 --> 00:16:31.019
The attack is lost.

00:16:31.019 --> 00:16:36.446
TRAVIS: Any reason why?

00:16:36.446 --> 00:16:37.296
MATT: You don't know.

00:16:37.296 --> 00:16:42.497
TRAVIS: Not that I'd know. Cool. Do I have another
attack?

00:16:42.497 --> 00:16:44.730
MATT: Yeah. You have two attacks.

00:16:44.730 --> 00:16:46.200
MARISHA: He just Jedi mind-tricked you.

00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:51.359
TRAVIS: I shake off the random numb arm,
and I toss it over to the other hand like,

00:16:51.359 --> 00:16:53.439
"C'mon, Betsy!" And I throw it with that hand.

00:16:53.439 --> 00:16:54.325
(all laugh)

00:16:54.325 --> 00:16:57.828
MATT: Okay. Roll another wisdom saving throw.

00:16:57.828 --> 00:17:03.522
TRAVIS: I don't know D&amp;amp;D enough to know what the
fuck's happening right now. Ooh! 16?

00:17:03.522 --> 00:17:08.230
MATT: Uh, 16, actually let me see this real fast.

00:17:08.230 --> 00:17:11.270
TRAVIS: I have a modifier of zero. Minus two.

00:17:11.270 --> 00:17:12.256
LAURA: Minus two.

00:17:12.256 --> 00:17:13.429
TRAVIS: I rolled an 18.

00:17:13.429 --> 00:17:16.115
TALIESIN: Monks are not in my wheelhouse.

00:17:16.115 --> 00:17:18.657
MATT: Monks are fun.

00:17:18.657 --> 00:17:22.163
MARISHA: I feel like this guy's special, too.

00:17:22.163 --> 00:17:24.448
TRAVIS: He's not even here. This is a dream.

00:17:24.448 --> 00:17:28.405
LIAM: Slowly, Raishan uncurls like a Xenomorph
from the ceiling.

00:17:28.405 --> 00:17:29.242
MATT: What'd you roll?

00:17:29.242 --> 00:17:30.029
TRAVIS: 16.

00:17:30.029 --> 00:17:33.857
MATT: Nope. This time, you do manage to push
through and throw the hammer, but you end up

00:17:33.857 --> 00:17:38.708
throwing it way wide. Like, 20 feet away from him.
Like, you're looking at him and just go (whoosh)

00:17:38.708 --> 00:17:40.927
(all laugh)

00:17:40.927 --> 00:17:44.865
MATT: It comes back, and you catch it, and you're
like, something's just messing with your mind.

00:17:44.865 --> 00:17:47.411
There's something about his presence right now
that is

00:17:47.411 --> 00:17:51.288
oppressing your ability to actually attack
towards him.

00:17:51.288 --> 00:17:54.689
TRAVIS: All right. All I have is my bonus action.

00:17:54.689 --> 00:17:56.464
MATT: Well, you used your bonus action to rage,
right?

00:17:56.464 --> 00:17:59.036
TRAVIS: Oh I did, yeah. I don't have a bonus
action. That's my turn.

00:17:59.036 --> 00:18:03.031
MATT: All right. He turns towards you. Walks
forward--

00:18:03.031 --> 00:18:05.119
TRAVIS: No, I don't.

00:18:05.119 --> 00:18:10.574
MATT: --very, just, carefully and intently.
That's his turn. You go.

00:18:10.574 --> 00:18:12.451
TRAVIS: God dang it!

00:18:12.451 --> 00:18:18.339
LAURA: Oh man. What does he want-a!

00:18:18.339 --> 00:18:19.155
TALIESIN: (whispering) Popcorn.

00:18:19.155 --> 00:18:20.455
LAURA: (whispering) He wants popcorn.

00:18:20.455 --> 00:18:21.613
TALIESIN: &nbsp;(whispering) He wants popcorn.

00:18:21.613 --> 00:18:23.293
TRAVIS: I try and hit him with it with both
hands.

00:18:23.293 --> 00:18:24.771
MATT: Okay, so you you're using both hands--

00:18:24.771 --> 00:18:25.933
TRAVIS: Yeah, both hands.

00:18:25.933 --> 00:18:27.496
MATT: Go for it. Roll a wisdom saving throw.

00:18:27.496 --> 00:18:29.425
(laughter)

00:18:29.425 --> 00:18:30.812
LIAM: Look at his little boy smile.

00:18:30.812 --> 00:18:32.466
TRAVIS: Six!

00:18:32.466 --> 00:18:35.923
MATT: You go to swing and he seems to blur for a
moment, your eyes blink and as you swing with the

00:18:35.923 --> 00:18:40.937
hammer, you swung far to your left and it's almost
like your arms are intentionally missing and

00:18:40.937 --> 00:18:43.609
almost fighting your directoral sense.

00:18:43.609 --> 00:18:45.604
LAURA: Shut up, Brian Wayne Foster!

00:18:45.604 --> 00:18:49.328
MARISHA: Awesome! Brian Fostah.

00:18:49.328 --> 00:18:55.098
TRAVIS: This is so stupid! Okay, I keep the hammer
in one hand but I just try and punch him with the

00:18:55.098 --> 00:18:56.977
Titanstone Knuckles out of frustration.

00:18:56.977 --> 00:18:58.730
MATT: Okay. Make a wisdom saving throw.

00:18:58.730 --> 00:19:01.260
TRAVIS: What? No weapon in my hand?

00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:04.280
MATT: Mm-hm.

00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:05.698
TRAVIS: Nine!

00:19:05.698 --> 00:19:10.735
MATT: You go to punch and by the time it gets to
his chest there's so little force behind it that

00:19:10.735 --> 00:19:16.103
your fingers just kind of unfold open against him,
almost breaking your wrist in the process,

00:19:16.103 --> 00:19:24.726
and you pull back, and he's just staring right at
you. "Show me you have the will to fight.

00:19:24.726 --> 00:19:31.243
Come at me!" Are you going to move or are you 
going to stay where you are?

00:19:31.296 --> 00:19:35.958
TRAVIS: I'm going to stay within his attack range,
but I'm going to 180 around him.

00:19:35.958 --> 00:19:39.891
MATT: Okay. That's easy enough to get around here.
All righty.

00:19:39.891 --> 00:19:41.138
TRAVIS: And I'll stay there.

00:19:41.138 --> 00:19:43.251
MATT: All right. For his turn, he turns around--

00:19:43.251 --> 00:19:46.412
TRAVIS: No he doesn't. Come on. Come on.

00:19:46.412 --> 00:19:47.478
MATT: Your turn.

00:19:47.478 --> 00:19:51.913
TRAVIS: Oh, this is a nightmare. I just want to
hit him!

00:19:51.913 --> 00:19:54.896
(all laugh)

00:19:54.896 --> 00:19:59.400
TRAVIS: All right. All right. Maybe it's all
about love!

00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:01.487
And I try and give him a bear hug!

00:20:01.487 --> 00:20:03.291
MATT: Okay... make a wisdom saving
throw.

00:20:03.291 --> 00:20:08.368
TRAVIS: No!

00:20:08.368 --> 00:20:09.256
LAURA: You got this.

00:20:09.256 --> 00:20:10.345
Natural 20.

00:20:10.345 --> 00:20:11.640
TRAVIS: That's a zero.

00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:13.030
(all laugh)

00:20:13.030 --> 00:20:14.060
TRAVIS: I rolled a two.

00:20:14.060 --> 00:20:15.754
LAURA: Two zero, exactly.

00:20:15.754 --> 00:20:20.305
MATT: You go to grab him, and you
reach, and you feel this physical form in your

00:20:20.305 --> 00:20:24.286
grasp, and then your arms all of a sudden touch
nothing, and you realize that he's standing where

00:20:24.286 --> 00:20:29.977
he was. You grabbed what was almost like a mirage
or an illusion, it's almost like your brain is

00:20:29.977 --> 00:20:35.531
playing tricks on you. That's one attack.

00:20:35.531 --> 00:20:36.933
TRAVIS: (surprised grunt)

00:20:36.933 --> 00:20:41.108
LAURA: You can do it, Grog! I don't know 
what he wants, but figure it out!

00:20:41.176 --> 00:20:42.853
TRAVIS: I look so pathetic right now.

00:20:42.853 --> 00:20:44.553
SAM: Yo, how does it look to the rest of the
gang?

00:20:44.553 --> 00:20:45.981
MATT: It looks hilarious.

00:20:45.981 --> 00:20:46.992
(all laugh)

00:20:46.992 --> 00:20:48.357
LIAM: What did we just see?

00:20:48.357 --> 00:20:50.445
MATT: It's
hilarious, and it's disconcerting, because you're

00:20:50.445 --> 00:20:55.804
watching as Grog, in the middle of his rage,
most of his attacks are amateur, far too wide

00:20:55.991 --> 00:21:03.064
away from the target, or by the time they get
close, he is holding himself back. And you don't

00:21:03.064 --> 00:21:07.183
know why. Something is messing with his will and
preventing him

00:21:07.183 --> 00:21:12.712
from being able to follow through 
with his attacks.

00:21:12.765 --> 00:21:15.453
TRAVIS: Okay. (sighs)

00:21:15.453 --> 00:21:16.748
MATT: Second attack?

00:21:16.748 --> 00:21:22.828
TRAVIS: Second attack. I just want to touch him
with my finger. Just, like, a boop.

00:21:22.894 --> 00:21:25.154
MATT: Okay. You reach out and your
finger touches his chest

00:21:25.154 --> 00:21:26.073
(cracking sound),
and you feel--

00:21:26.073 --> 00:21:27.451
TRAVIS: He's real?! He's there?!

00:21:27.451 --> 00:21:29.203
MATT: He's real. The skin's there.

00:21:29.203 --> 00:21:32.412
TRAVIS: Thought you might be a dragon.
Wisdom saving throw?

00:21:32.412 --> 00:21:33.773
MATT: That wasn't an
attack.

00:21:33.773 --> 00:21:34.856
TRAVIS: Oh! I touched him!

00:21:34.856 --> 00:21:35.704
MATT: You touched him.

00:21:35.704 --> 00:21:37.008
LAURA: Great job, Grog!

00:21:37.008 --> 00:21:38.330
MARISHA: We believe in you, Grog!

00:21:38.330 --> 00:21:39.798
LIAM: Okay, now ramp it up!

00:21:39.798 --> 00:21:41.034
(all laugh)

00:21:41.034 --> 00:21:45.286
MATT: He smiles at you and goes,
"And with gentleness there comes clarity."

00:21:45.286 --> 00:21:49.054
TRAVIS: (heavy breathing)

00:21:49.054 --> 00:21:51.051
SAM: I think
you're going to have to fuck him, Grog.

00:21:51.051 --> 00:21:54.579
(all laugh)

00:21:54.579 --> 00:21:55.737
MATT: And that's your turn?

00:21:55.737 --> 00:21:56.420
TRAVIS: That's my turn.

00:21:56.420 --> 00:21:57.685
MATT: Okay.

00:21:57.685 --> 00:22:00.251
SAM: (quietly) What? With gentleness there comes--?

00:22:00.312 --> 00:22:02.661
MATT: "With
gentleness there comes clarity." And he smiles

00:22:02.661 --> 00:22:08.894
through his big, white-grey beard. And then the
smile fades, his eyes flash, and he is going to

00:22:08.894 --> 00:22:12.189
attack you with a flurry of blows.

00:22:12.189 --> 00:22:13.630
LAURA: Oh no.

00:22:13.630 --> 00:22:16.878
TRAVIS: Wait, I haven't learned the lesson yet. I'm still--

00:22:16.878 --> 00:22:18.151
MATT: The lesson's just begun.

00:22:18.151 --> 00:22:20.503
TRAVIS: Oh no.

00:22:20.503 --> 00:22:24.693
MATT: All right, that is-- ooh.
33 to hit.

00:22:24.693 --> 00:22:27.610
TRAVIS: (squeaky voice) Mmm, yep.

00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:29.730
MATT: That is a 24 to hit.

00:22:29.730 --> 00:22:32.037
TRAVIS: (squeaky voice) Yep.

00:22:32.037 --> 00:22:33.749
MATT: That is a natural one.

00:22:33.749 --> 00:22:39.124
So that is a failure. And it's a 32 to hit,
so he hits you three times.

00:22:39.124 --> 00:22:42.276
LAURA: Jeez Louise.

00:22:42.276 --> 00:22:44.619
MATT: So you're raging, so you take half damage
from these, because they're bludgeoning,

00:22:44.619 --> 00:22:45.889
since he's punching you.

00:22:45.889 --> 00:22:47.166
TRAVIS: Mmhmm.

00:22:47.166 --> 00:22:49.851
MATT: His eyes flash, he rushes up and pummels

00:22:49.851 --> 00:22:54.731
you once in the chin, elbows you in the sternum,
goes and grabs your shoulder and leaps over

00:22:54.731 --> 00:23:00.253
behind you and then kicks straight back into the
middle of your shoulder blades and (pained gasp)

00:23:00.253 --> 00:23:02.698
you feel the breath almost get kicked out of you.

00:23:02.698 --> 00:23:09.262
That is 15 bludgeoning damage, halved to--

00:23:09.274 --> 00:23:10.454
TRAVIS: Seven?

00:23:10.454 --> 00:23:11.495
MATT: We'll say eight.

00:23:11.495 --> 00:23:12.968
TRAVIS: Eight? Yeah.

00:23:12.968 --> 00:23:22.219
MATT: That is nine, reduced to five,
and that is 13 reduced to seven. There you go.

00:23:22.376 --> 00:23:24.411
TRAVIS: Oh shit, that's 20 points of damage.
Cool.

00:23:24.411 --> 00:23:26.245
MATT: That's his turn. You're
up.

00:23:26.245 --> 00:23:31.745
TRAVIS: Uh, yeah. Sweet, sweet anus.

00:23:31.745 --> 00:23:33.406
MARISHA: That's a really good British
candy.

00:23:33.406 --> 00:23:43.034
TRAVIS: What do monks do? Can I, like,
use my magic powers? And I want to keep my eyes

00:23:43.034 --> 00:23:48.167
closed, and I'm gonna swing around behind me,
knowing that I just got kicked in the back there.

00:23:48.167 --> 00:23:50.085
MATT: Okay, go ahead and make an attack with
disadvantage.

00:23:50.085 --> 00:23:52.616
TRAVIS: Oh! No wisdom saving
throw?

00:23:52.616 --> 00:23:53.498
MATT: Nope.

00:23:53.498 --> 00:23:56.062
LAURA: With gentleness comes clarity.

00:23:56.062 --> 00:23:58.821
You touched him, maybe if you'd've shaken
his hand.

00:23:58.821 --> 00:24:00.095
TRAVIS: With disadvantage?

00:24:00.095 --> 00:24:03.573
MATT: With disadvantage, because you have your
eyes closed.

00:24:03.573 --> 00:24:06.470
TRAVIS: Uh, 23.

00:24:06.470 --> 00:24:07.913
MATT: That just barely hits.

00:24:07.913 --> 00:24:09.035
(all gasp)

00:24:09.035 --> 00:24:10.737
MATT: Go ahead and roll
damage.

00:24:10.737 --> 00:24:14.105
TRAVIS: (mumbling) Okay, with a ten.

00:24:14.105 --> 00:24:15.685
SAM: So what did we learn from that?

00:24:15.685 --> 00:24:17.180
TRAVIS: I
should've done it reckless. No, I don't want him

00:24:17.180 --> 00:24:19.745
rolling reckless, holy shit! God, I'll die in a
second.

00:24:19.745 --> 00:24:21.214
MARISHA: His AC's 23.

00:24:21.214 --> 00:24:23.993
SAM: No, that-- close your eyes-- or, how
does this... what?

00:24:23.993 --> 00:24:25.233
LIAM: It might be touch.

00:24:25.233 --> 00:24:26.469
SAM: I'm so confused.

00:24:26.469 --> 00:24:27.779
LIAM: You're unconscious.

00:24:27.779 --> 00:24:29.072
TALIESIN: You've got the touch.

00:24:29.072 --> 00:24:31.211
TRAVIS: That's 18 points of damage.

00:24:31.211 --> 00:24:34.771
MATT: 18 points of damage, gotcha.
That's your first strike (hitting sound).

00:24:34.771 --> 00:24:40.624
You feel the weapon behind you make contact with
a form, and (cracking noise), you see a little bit

00:24:40.624 --> 00:24:43.776
of sand out of your peripheral this side go
(scattering sound) as his form gets pushed about a

00:24:43.776 --> 00:24:46.044
foot, kind of setting some of it off.

00:24:46.044 --> 00:24:47.778
TRAVIS: So
it goes (low hitting sound). I close my eyes

00:24:47.778 --> 00:24:50.078
again. I swing around the other way, and I try to
connect.

00:24:50.078 --> 00:24:59.397
MATT: Okay, roll again with disadvantage.

00:24:59.397 --> 00:25:05.329
TRAVIS: That's not bad. 14 and 20,
uh... 29.

00:25:05.329 --> 00:25:06.443
MATT: That hits, yes.

00:25:06.443 --> 00:25:10.900
TRAVIS: Yes, okay. Damn, same thing, so
18 points of damage.

00:25:10.900 --> 00:25:17.161
MATT: 18 points of damage. All righty.

00:25:17.210 --> 00:25:23.627
As he takes both impacts, kind of parrying them
with his forearms with each impact. They're still

00:25:23.627 --> 00:25:28.955
hitting him, and he's still taking the brunt of
the attack and the pain, but with each hit you can

00:25:28.955 --> 00:25:35.071
feel the force of his forearm is almost stopping
still the hammer blow as you're throwing it behind

00:25:35.071 --> 00:25:39.615
you, and you can see him gritting teeth with each
impact, but he's just staring right at you again

00:25:39.615 --> 00:25:45.829
as you kind of spin around, open your eye again to
see what you did.

00:25:45.829 --> 00:25:48.907
He kind of gives you a bit of a
narrowed glare--

00:25:48.907 --> 00:25:49.948
TRAVIS: Stink eye?

00:25:49.948 --> 00:25:51.007
MATT: Little bit of a stink eye.

00:25:51.007 --> 00:25:51.718
TRAVIS: Fuck.

00:25:51.718 --> 00:25:53.603
MATT: But like an intentional kind of connecting
point and just says--

00:25:53.603 --> 00:25:54.728
TRAVIS: Pink eye?

00:25:54.728 --> 00:25:57.873
MATT: No, that's a whole different--
that's a different monk path.

00:25:57.873 --> 00:26:00.461
(all laugh)

00:26:00.461 --> 00:26:06.862
LAURA: Like that little hobbit.

00:26:06.862 --> 00:26:08.006
TRAVIS: Be nice.

00:26:08.006 --> 00:26:09.319
MATT: Let's see
here.

00:26:09.319 --> 00:26:11.456
TRAVIS: I'm a student here.

00:26:11.456 --> 00:26:13.304
LAURA: What's the lesson? What's the lesson?!

00:26:13.304 --> 00:26:15.102
MATT: Okay,
he's going to go ahead and attack you twice.

00:26:15.102 --> 00:26:18.884
(punch sound) Two punches, straight to your back
of your shoulders and neck as you're turning

00:26:18.884 --> 00:26:25.658
around to look at him. That is a 17, misses.
No, that does hit.

00:26:25.658 --> 00:26:27.425
TRAVIS: That hits, yeah, it's my AC.

00:26:27.425 --> 00:26:28.517
MATT: And a 23.

00:26:28.517 --> 00:26:29.194
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:26:29.194 --> 00:26:34.136
MATT: So both hit you. That is... 
16, so eight damage.

00:26:34.202 --> 00:26:35.630
TRAVIS: Okay.

00:26:35.630 --> 00:26:37.412
MATT: And that is ten, so five damage.

00:26:37.434 --> 00:26:39.071
TRAVIS: Okay.

00:26:39.071 --> 00:26:44.171
MATT: And he's going to spend three ki.

00:26:44.171 --> 00:26:45.592
TRAVIS: Three ki?!

00:26:45.592 --> 00:26:49.207
MATT: Yeah, three ki points. 
So, the first punch hits you across

00:26:49.207 --> 00:26:54.760
the chin. The second one, he slams his fingers,
curled up, right into your sternum as you turn

00:26:54.760 --> 00:27:01.230
around to face him (whack), and as it hits you,
you feel these kind of vibrations, ripples,

00:27:01.230 --> 00:27:06.444
carry through your body, and then slowly fade
inside. And you feel this tingling, this very

00:27:06.444 --> 00:27:10.745
faint, brief numbness that just kind of lingers
throughout your body. You can feel it gathering at

00:27:10.745 --> 00:27:18.600
the edge of fingertips and toes, almost like
ripples through a lake, and he steps away.

00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:20.745
You get to make an attack of opportunity if you'd
like.

00:27:20.745 --> 00:27:23.051
TRAVIS: (strained) I would.

00:27:23.051 --> 00:27:25.204
MATT: Don't forget, you can use your reaction to
get an attack back because of

00:27:25.204 --> 00:27:27.361
your retaliation ability.

00:27:27.361 --> 00:27:32.430
TRAVIS: Yeah, I've totally forgotten that,
I'm just totally stunned at this point.

00:27:32.430 --> 00:27:35.942
That's good, that's 32.

00:27:35.942 --> 00:27:38.016
MATT: 32 hits.
Go ahead and roll damage.

00:27:38.016 --> 00:27:41.419
TRAVIS: (sing-songy noises) That's a ten.

00:27:41.419 --> 00:27:42.630
LAURA: Yeah.

00:27:42.630 --> 00:27:44.043
LIAM: All
these sounds are in game, in character.

00:27:44.043 --> 00:27:45.144
TRAVIS: So 20, 25.

00:27:45.144 --> 00:27:47.125
LAURA and LIAM: (gibberish)

00:27:47.125 --> 00:27:52.270
MARISHA: (laughs) When Grog becomes Popeye.

00:27:52.270 --> 00:27:56.520
MATT: All righty, and he just stands across the way,
and just kind of beckons you towards him.

00:27:56.520 --> 00:27:57.524
Your turn.

00:27:57.524 --> 00:27:59.113
TRAVIS: And I feel all shake-weighty
at the moment, right?

00:27:59.113 --> 00:28:00.480
MATT: Yeah. You're not quite sure.

00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:04.025
You don't feel bad, it's just this
kind of uneasiness in your body.

00:28:04.025 --> 00:28:05.680
TRAVIS: Can I take a step towards him?

00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:07.596
MATT: Mm-hm, take a
step forward.

00:28:07.596 --> 00:28:09.272
TRAVIS: Does anything happen? Do I
shit my pants?

00:28:09.272 --> 00:28:10.792
MATT: Nope.

00:28:10.792 --> 00:28:11.779
(all laugh)

00:28:11.779 --> 00:28:13.499
MATT: Not yet.

00:28:13.499 --> 00:28:15.416
TRAVIS: Can I take the other four steps

00:28:15.416 --> 00:28:21.268
of the five step exploding heart point technique
thing?

00:28:21.268 --> 00:28:22.574
MATT: Seems fine.

00:28:22.574 --> 00:28:24.497
TRAVIS: Cool.

00:28:24.497 --> 00:28:26.475
MARISHA: What would you have done if you shat
your pants on that fifth step?

00:28:26.475 --> 00:28:27.648
LAURA: Oh my god,
that would have been amazing.

00:28:27.786 --> 00:28:30.995
TRAVIS: Just
explosive shat. I'd be, like, kill me now.

00:28:30.995 --> 00:28:32.337
Kill me now, take it away.

00:28:32.337 --> 00:28:33.854
MARISHA: Just lost
your bowels.

00:28:33.854 --> 00:28:37.150
MATT: (laughs) I'd have to bring
out the cone template for that.

00:28:37.150 --> 00:28:38.835
MARISHA: Like a
very dedicated marathon runner.

00:28:38.835 --> 00:28:42.432
LAURA: (laughs) Area of effect?

00:28:42.432 --> 00:28:44.976
TRAVIS: Can I close the rest of
the distance to him?

00:28:44.976 --> 00:28:50.158
MATT: Sure.

00:28:50.158 --> 00:28:52.709
TRAVIS: I want to try the bear hug again.
I want to grapple him.

00:28:52.709 --> 00:28:58.578
MATT: Okay. So, go ahead. And I think it's your
athletics versus his--

00:28:58.578 --> 00:29:00.208
TRAVIS: So I can touch him
now.

00:29:00.208 --> 00:29:01.984
MATT: (mumbling) Acrobatics, I'm pretty
sure.

00:29:01.984 --> 00:29:05.296
TRAVIS: The wisdom saving throw was
something in the beginning.

00:29:05.296 --> 00:29:06.774
LAURA: Yeah, I think it was,

00:29:06.774 --> 00:29:09.356
you have to shake his hand or do
something, like, gentle to him.

00:29:09.356 --> 00:29:12.278
LIAM: I like the idea that it's silent in here and
we're just hearing sand get kicked around

00:29:12.278 --> 00:29:14.769
and Grog breathing like a bull.

00:29:14.769 --> 00:29:18.253
LAURA: I like to think that Earthbreaker
Groon has, like, mood music for his fights.

00:29:18.253 --> 00:29:19.434
MARISHA: Agreed, yeah.

00:29:19.434 --> 00:29:20.832
TRAVIS: There's
frustrated grunts happening.

00:29:20.832 --> 00:29:21.891
LAURA: He's got a sound system.

00:29:21.891 --> 00:29:23.047
MATT: So, make an athletics check.

00:29:23.047 --> 00:29:23.791
TRAVIS: Okay.

00:29:23.791 --> 00:29:24.823
MARISHA: Like war drums, yeah.

00:29:24.823 --> 00:29:25.776
TALIESIN: Like taiko. (low drum sounds)

00:29:25.776 --> 00:29:27.174
LAURA: Ooh! That'd be sick.

00:29:27.174 --> 00:29:28.371
MARISHA: (joins in on the drum sounds)
Totally.

00:29:28.371 --> 00:29:31.366
TRAVIS: 24. Plus 16 plus
eight.

00:29:31.366 --> 00:29:34.040
MATT: Yeah, okay, so you go to grab him and he
just (fwish) slips out.

00:29:34.040 --> 00:29:39.653
TRAVIS: Damn. My
athletics versus his? Judo?

00:29:39.653 --> 00:29:41.846
MATT: He just kind of like parries it to the side,

00:29:41.846 --> 00:29:45.462
ducks under and
rights himself, just out of your grasp.

00:29:45.462 --> 00:29:48.747
TRAVIS: Cool, that was nice. Do I have a second
attack?

00:29:48.747 --> 00:29:50.431
MATT: Yeah.

00:29:50.431 --> 00:29:54.353
TRAVIS: Two-handed great weapon master, please.

00:29:54.353 --> 00:29:58.771
MATT: Okay, go for it.

00:29:58.771 --> 00:30:02.602
TRAVIS: That's not going to hit. 24.

00:30:02.783 --> 00:30:03.950
MATT: 24 hits.

00:30:03.950 --> 00:30:04.742
TRAVIS: Oh, it does?

00:30:04.742 --> 00:30:05.359
MATT: Yeah.

00:30:05.359 --> 00:30:06.434
TRAVIS: Oh, 23, that's right.

00:30:06.434 --> 00:30:07.636
LIAM: 23 was the threshold.

00:30:07.636 --> 00:30:09.736
TRAVIS: Thank you, god. No it doesn't, 24 minus
five.

00:30:09.736 --> 00:30:15.101
MATT: Oh, minus five. So, as you go to swing,
both of your hands on the hammer, (grunts) giant

00:30:15.101 --> 00:30:22.301
downward arc. As it slams downward, you see his
form (whoosh) shift, and suddenly he's two feet to

00:30:22.301 --> 00:30:27.263
the right. He moved so fast with the side step,
and you slam it down into the sand. You guys

00:30:27.263 --> 00:30:32.478
watch as this crater emerges (boom), and the sand
shoots off the sides from the impact of Grog's

00:30:32.478 --> 00:30:36.096
blow on the ground. Groon seemingly unaffected.

00:30:36.096 --> 00:30:42.048
TRAVIS: That ends my--

00:30:42.048 --> 00:30:44.165
MATT: You're not frenzied yet, right?

00:30:44.165 --> 00:30:47.949
TRAVIS: Nope. That ends my turn. Yep.

00:30:47.949 --> 00:30:55.164
MATT: Okay. At the end of your turn, he's going to
go ahead and make an unarmed attack on you.

00:30:55.164 --> 00:30:56.749
TRAVIS: Unarmed attack?

00:30:56.749 --> 00:31:00.974
MATT: That's just his punch as a part of his
legendary action here. That is a 27 to hit.

00:31:00.974 --> 00:31:03.329
TRAVIS: Oh, that hits.

00:31:03.329 --> 00:31:06.250
MATT: You suffer another ten points of bludgeoning
damage, reduced to five.

00:31:06.250 --> 00:31:07.333
TRAVIS: Okay.

00:31:07.333 --> 00:31:09.952
MATT: Now it's Groon's turn.

00:31:10.019 --> 00:31:14.708
TALIESIN: Two lair actions.

00:31:14.708 --> 00:31:25.061
MATT: He's gonna go ahead and make another series
of attacks on you. That is an 18?

00:31:25.061 --> 00:31:27.279
TRAVIS: Yeah, that hits.

00:31:27.279 --> 00:31:28.314
MATT: 17.

00:31:28.314 --> 00:31:29.782
TRAVIS: Hits, also.

00:31:29.782 --> 00:31:33.793
MATT: All right. So that is nine plus eight.
That'd be 17.

00:31:33.793 --> 00:31:36.257
So, say nine points of bludgeoning.

00:31:36.257 --> 00:31:37.961
TRAVIS: Nine?

00:31:37.961 --> 00:31:44.183
MATT: And then--ooh! 18. So another nine points of
bludgeoning damage. I need you to go ahead and

00:31:44.183 --> 00:31:46.379
make a constitution saving throw.

00:31:46.429 --> 00:31:50.639
TRAVIS: Damn, Gina.

00:31:50.639 --> 00:31:54.272
LIAM: Nice pull.

00:31:54.272 --> 00:31:56.387
SAM: I don't get it.

00:31:56.387 --> 00:31:57.606
TRAVIS: 21.

00:31:57.606 --> 00:32:06.039
MATT: 21, okay. As his first hit is a long round
haymaker punch across the chin, he comes from

00:32:06.039 --> 00:32:11.340
underneath and goes for an uppercut that hits you
right in the jaw. Right at the side where usually

00:32:11.340 --> 00:32:16.146
it would snap and really mess with somebody's
ability to stay either conscious or control their

00:32:16.146 --> 00:32:21.618
atmosphere. You just manage to maneuver out of the
way where it hurts, but the impact doesn't hit its

00:32:21.618 --> 00:32:25.585
intended place, and you resist the effect.

00:32:25.585 --> 00:32:26.808
TRAVIS: What was the effect?

00:32:26.808 --> 00:32:27.602
MATT: You don't know.

00:32:27.602 --> 00:32:29.858
TRAVIS: God damn it.

00:32:29.858 --> 00:32:30.871
SAM: Diarrhea.

00:32:30.871 --> 00:32:32.254
LAURA: Instant knockout.

00:32:32.254 --> 00:32:33.673
TRAVIS: I'll shit my pants before this fight is
over with.

00:32:33.673 --> 00:32:34.799
LAURA: The button.

00:32:34.799 --> 00:32:35.710
TRAVIS: On the button?

00:32:35.710 --> 00:32:36.537
LAURA: It's the button.

00:32:36.537 --> 00:32:37.781
TRAVIS: It's the brown note.

00:32:37.781 --> 00:32:39.273
MATT: It's your turn.

00:32:39.273 --> 00:32:44.107
TRAVIS: My turn. I am so tired of this slippery
shit. I go into a frenzied rage!

00:32:44.107 --> 00:32:45.018
MATT: Okay.

00:32:45.018 --> 00:32:49.040
(unenthused cheering)

00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:51.920
TRAVIS: Yeah, thank you. I would like to Great
Weapon Master

00:32:51.920 --> 00:32:56.072
try to hit him with the Dwarven Thrower.

00:32:56.072 --> 00:32:58.590
MATT: Go for it.

00:32:58.590 --> 00:33:01.792
TRAVIS: Not reckless.

00:33:01.792 --> 00:33:14.513
No. (crying) I don't know what the lesson
is. 32 minus five is 37.

00:33:14.538 --> 00:33:15.142
MATT: 27?

00:33:15.192 --> 00:33:16.436
TRAVIS: 27!

00:33:16.436 --> 00:33:17.638
MATT: That hits.

00:33:17.638 --> 00:33:24.201
TRAVIS: Yeah. 32 minus five is 37! 35.

00:33:24.411 --> 00:33:34.013
MATT: Okay. This one cracks him right across the
side of his shoulder and pec area (wham),

00:33:34.013 --> 00:33:38.453
and you watch as for the first time since this
battle started, he loses his footing, and he has

00:33:38.453 --> 00:33:42.987
to catch himself behind. His head looks back and
he turns around towards you and a big smile goes

00:33:42.987 --> 00:33:48.893
across his face as he goes, "Good. Keep showing
me."

00:33:48.893 --> 00:33:52.703
TRAVIS: I was encouraged until he got creepy with
the talking.

00:33:52.703 --> 00:33:55.145
LAURA: Maybe he just likes getting hit.

00:33:55.306 --> 00:33:56.725
TRAVIS: All right, I hit him again!

00:33:56.725 --> 00:33:57.871
MATT: Go for it.

00:33:57.871 --> 00:34:02.058
TRAVIS: That's gonna hit. That's a 31 minus five
is 26.

00:34:02.058 --> 00:34:05.020
MATT: Yeah, go ahead and roll damage.

00:34:05.088 --> 00:34:09.918
TRAVIS: 22... 32.

00:34:09.918 --> 00:34:14.183
MATT: 32. Nice.

00:34:14.183 --> 00:34:16.988
LAURA: He's got like 5,000 hit points. More than
last time.

00:34:16.988 --> 00:34:19.306
TRAVIS: Last one. Reckless.

00:34:19.306 --> 00:34:20.191
MATT: Okay.

00:34:20.191 --> 00:34:21.573
LAURA: (gasps)

00:34:21.573 --> 00:34:23.257
TRAVIS: What's life without a little spice?

00:34:23.257 --> 00:34:24.775
MATT: Sure.

00:34:24.775 --> 00:34:26.946
MARISHA: Ask him.

00:34:26.946 --> 00:34:31.435
TRAVIS: 18, not quite. 34 minus--29.

00:34:31.435 --> 00:34:32.395
MATT: That hits, yeah.

00:34:32.395 --> 00:34:47.769
TRAVIS: Yeah. Close to what I wanted. This is 33.

00:34:47.951 --> 00:34:54.350
MATT: Okay, cool. All right, so, as you unleash
your next series of blows against him, you saw him

00:34:54.350 --> 00:34:57.961
topple from the first hit. The other two,
he pulls his arms in and takes them, one to the

00:34:57.961 --> 00:35:01.554
shoulder, and the other one hits him in the
stomach (air getting knocked out) and he grabs

00:35:01.554 --> 00:35:09.705
your arm, and pushes off. Jumps in the air and
lands about five feet from you.

00:35:09.705 --> 00:35:14.669
TRAVIS: Is he bruised? Is there a slap mark? I
mean, is there any blood? Anything to tell me that

00:35:14.669 --> 00:35:16.314
I might be doing a good job?

00:35:16.314 --> 00:35:19.352
MATT: He looks, more so than the previous fight that
you had with him,

00:35:19.537 --> 00:35:21.909
it looks like he's starting to take some hits.

00:35:21.909 --> 00:35:24.021
TRAVIS: Good! Yeah.

00:35:24.021 --> 00:35:26.101
MATT: He's gonna use Legendary Action to take a
hit on you.

00:35:26.101 --> 00:35:27.953
LIAM: A Legendary Action?

00:35:27.953 --> 00:35:30.701
MATT: That is a 30.

00:35:30.701 --> 00:35:32.275
TRAVIS: (squeaks) Hits.

00:35:32.275 --> 00:35:33.973
MATT: Actually it's with advantage because--

00:35:33.973 --> 00:35:35.319
TRAVIS: Yep.

00:35:35.319 --> 00:35:37.961
MATT: So that is another nine points of
bludgeoning damage.

00:35:37.961 --> 00:35:38.654
TRAVIS: Sweet.

00:35:38.654 --> 00:35:40.183
MATT: Not halved. That is what it is halved.

00:35:40.183 --> 00:35:41.420
TRAVIS: Okay. Because it's legendary--

00:35:41.420 --> 00:35:42.713
MATT: Because it would be 18, yeah.

00:35:42.713 --> 00:35:44.187
TRAVIS: Right.

00:35:44.187 --> 00:35:56.876
MATT: Okay. His turn. He slowly walks around you.
And says, "Your size is useful for those who know

00:35:56.876 --> 00:36:05.213
not how to use it against you." And he rushes
down, beneath your large standing form, and goes

00:36:05.213 --> 00:36:09.181
into a series of strikes against the inside of
your knees and your legs

00:36:09.181 --> 00:36:11.988
and we'll see how the last blow hits.

00:36:11.988 --> 00:36:14.024
TRAVIS: I've been forgetting to roll my enlarged
damage.

00:36:14.024 --> 00:36:16.393
MATT: That's a 30 on the first hit.

00:36:16.393 --> 00:36:18.886
TRAVIS: Yep.

00:36:18.886 --> 00:36:21.387
MATT: That is a 21 on the second hit.

00:36:21.387 --> 00:36:24.017
TRAVIS: (high pitched) Yeah, sure.

00:36:24.017 --> 00:36:28.250
MATT: That is a 29 on the third hit.

00:36:28.250 --> 00:36:30.248
TRAVIS: (laughs) How many hits are there?!

00:36:30.248 --> 00:36:31.163
LAURA: Four.

00:36:31.163 --> 00:36:32.954
MATT: And natural 20 on the fourth.

00:36:32.954 --> 00:36:34.268
LIAM: Natural 20 to the gooch.

00:36:34.268 --> 00:36:35.822
LAURA: To the chode hit?!

00:36:35.822 --> 00:36:37.475
TRAVIS: Wow, had to Reckless, huh?

00:36:37.475 --> 00:36:38.210
MATT: Yeah.

00:36:38.210 --> 00:36:39.251
TRAVIS: Cool.

00:36:39.251 --> 00:36:41.327
TRAVIS: Vegas is a short trip this time.

00:36:41.327 --> 00:36:44.171
MATT: So that is 18 reduced to half; that's nine.

00:36:44.171 --> 00:36:46.141
TRAVIS: Okay.

00:36:46.141 --> 00:36:49.516
MATT: 14 reduced in half is seven.

00:36:49.516 --> 00:36:51.564
TRAVIS: Okay.

00:36:51.564 --> 00:36:53.147
MATT: That is a nine reduced in half is five.

00:36:53.147 --> 00:36:54.137
TRAVIS: Okay.

00:36:54.137 --> 00:36:59.985
MATT: And final strike is a 20. Reduced in half,
that is ten.

00:36:59.985 --> 00:37:03.081
TRAVIS: Can I use my Stone's Endurance on that
last one?

00:37:03.081 --> 00:37:04.117
MATT: Sure! Go for it.

00:37:04.117 --> 00:37:05.267
TRAVIS: All right.

00:37:05.267 --> 00:37:09.592
LAURA: Nice.

00:37:09.592 --> 00:37:18.481
TRAVIS: That's 12. Plus my constitution,
which is five, so 17.

00:37:18.702 --> 00:37:22.393
MATT: And I would like you to make another
constitution save.

00:37:22.393 --> 00:37:26.509
TRAVIS: Shit! So do I add 17 hit points back?

00:37:26.509 --> 00:37:29.352
MATT: No, you reduce the attack, which was 10
damage?

00:37:29.352 --> 00:37:30.817
TRAVIS: Yeah, so just wipe it out?

00:37:30.817 --> 00:37:32.499
MATT: Yeah, it does none.

00:37:32.572 --> 00:37:34.873
TRAVIS: Okay, cool. I'm getting down there.

00:37:34.873 --> 00:37:36.548
LAURA: Really?

00:37:36.548 --> 00:37:38.563
SAM: He's down to triple digits now.

00:37:38.563 --> 00:37:44.078
TRAVIS: Constitution saving throw. 18.

00:37:44.078 --> 00:37:45.081
MATT: 18.

00:37:45.081 --> 00:37:47.189
TRAVIS: Ten plus ten minus two is 18.

00:37:47.189 --> 00:37:53.762
MATT: Okay. You feel from that impact, all of your
muscles seize up. He goes for the same strike zone

00:37:53.762 --> 00:37:59.222
on the other side of the chin and hits and you
kind of (groans) as you pull back. And then,

00:37:59.222 --> 00:38:03.085
feel all of a sudden this pulse (throbbing
sound). The pulse (louder throbbing sound) and all

00:38:03.085 --> 00:38:05.888
your muscles tense up. You're stunned until the
end of your next turn.

00:38:05.888 --> 00:38:07.142
TRAVIS: Shit! (laughs)

00:38:07.142 --> 00:38:09.623
LAURA: What does being stunned do? You can't
move?

00:38:09.623 --> 00:38:11.720
MATT: Can't move, can't do anything, you're
considered incapacitated.

00:38:11.720 --> 00:38:13.227
TRAVIS: He Vulcan Pinched my ass.

00:38:13.227 --> 00:38:16.714
LIAM: Groon's in Vegas and your ass just came up
pineapples.

00:38:16.714 --> 00:38:19.675
LIAM &amp;amp; TRAVIS: (slot machine ringing)

00:38:19.675 --> 00:38:23.931
LAURA: I'm gonna pull an arrow out and just stand
there and get ready in case Groon does anything.

00:38:23.931 --> 00:38:30.601
MATT: Okay. Groon is thinking to go ahead and step
back to there.

00:38:30.601 --> 00:38:32.009
TRAVIS: What?

00:38:32.009 --> 00:38:34.066
MATT: Which would be there.

00:38:34.066 --> 00:38:36.612
LAURA: He's waiting for you to become unstunned.

00:38:36.612 --> 00:38:37.658
TRAVIS: Okay.

00:38:37.658 --> 00:38:40.366
MATT: And as he darts back, you guys watch as he
runs to the back. As he does, his feet barely

00:38:40.366 --> 00:38:44.590
touch the sand (fast, light footsteps). You see
these very faint little plumes behind each

00:38:44.590 --> 00:38:47.550
footstep, as this giant man has almost no weight
across the ground--

00:38:47.550 --> 00:38:48.740
TRAVIS: Like a jackrabbit.

00:38:48.740 --> 00:38:51.730
MATT:--as he runs with such speed. And as he lands
and finds his footing (loud boom), the weight

00:38:51.730 --> 00:38:55.429
seems to kick in once more, and you watch as the
sand (scattering sound) shoots out behind him.

00:38:55.429 --> 00:39:00.753
He stands his ground and crosses his arms,
and just watches. So Grog, it's your turn.

00:39:00.753 --> 00:39:06.070
You're stunned. You end your turn, you're no
longer stunned. It's now back to him.

00:39:06.070 --> 00:39:07.729
TRAVIS: (whispers) Fuck.

00:39:07.729 --> 00:39:11.706
MATT: He puts his hand up. Puts it up towards
you.

00:39:11.706 --> 00:39:13.121
SAM: Oh, no.

00:39:13.121 --> 00:39:14.649
MATT: Closes his fingers

00:39:14.649 --> 00:39:16.278
TRAVIS: Oh, no, I've seen this before.

00:39:16.278 --> 00:39:19.654
MATT: And you feel this (pulse) in your chest,
right in the sternum right where he hit you

00:39:19.654 --> 00:39:32.549
earlier. I need you to go ahead and roll a
constitution saving throw again.

00:39:32.615 --> 00:39:34.090
TRAVIS: 23 minus two, 21?

00:39:34.090 --> 00:39:35.037
SAM: Ooh?

00:39:35.037 --> 00:39:36.044
MATT: 21!

00:39:36.044 --> 00:39:37.019
SAM: Ooh!

00:39:37.019 --> 00:39:38.892
TRAVIS: Constitution I have a lot of. For my
saving throws.

00:39:38.892 --> 00:39:43.828
MATT: That (pulse) sound ripples out (rapid
impacts) and you feel the muscles begin to tear,

00:39:43.828 --> 00:39:48.932
the ligaments begin to burn from the inside.
You manage to, through the sheer force of

00:39:48.932 --> 00:39:54.304
physical constitution, shrug off what would've
been immensely more deadly circumstance,

00:39:54.304 --> 00:39:56.606
but you still do take 10d10 necrotic damage.

00:39:56.606 --> 00:39:58.063
(everyone groans)

00:39:58.063 --> 00:40:00.174
SAM: It would've been 20d10?

00:40:00.174 --> 00:40:01.884
MATT: No, you would've dropped to zero hit points.

00:40:01.884 --> 00:40:03.684
LAURA: Oh shit.

00:40:03.684 --> 00:40:05.083
TRAVIS: Is that the palm thing?

00:40:05.083 --> 00:40:05.982
MARISHA: Quivering Palm?

00:40:05.982 --> 00:40:08.023
MATT: It's the Quivering Palm. He's not holding
back this time.

00:40:08.023 --> 00:40:09.051
LAURA: Oh no!

00:40:09.051 --> 00:40:12.117
TRAVIS: Oh, I mean, don't make any special
exceptions on my part. Fuck.

00:40:12.117 --> 00:40:14.232
LIAM: Vax is watching; he just leaked a little
bit.

00:40:14.232 --> 00:40:16.005
LAURA: Gross!

00:40:16.005 --> 00:40:18.678
MATT: 18... 26.

00:40:18.678 --> 00:40:20.323
SAM: (whispers) Quivering Palm...

00:40:20.323 --> 00:40:26.467
LAURA: No one will ever notice, the armor already
stinks.

00:40:26.467 --> 00:40:28.650
MATT: Take 51 points of necrotic damage.

00:40:28.650 --> 00:40:29.458
TRAVIS: 52?

00:40:29.458 --> 00:40:30.693
MATT: 51 points of necrotic damage.

00:40:30.693 --> 00:40:35.424
TRAVIS: 51. Okay.

00:40:35.424 --> 00:40:37.226
LAURA: How much damage?

00:40:37.226 --> 00:40:40.220
MATT: 51 points of necrotic damage.

00:40:40.220 --> 00:40:41.651
TRAVIS: I'm out of the triple digits guys.

00:40:41.651 --> 00:40:42.542
LAURA: (gasps)

00:40:42.542 --> 00:40:44.689
SAM: Oh, man.

00:40:44.689 --> 00:40:46.546
LAURA: Does Grog look all bloody yet, or is he--

00:40:46.546 --> 00:40:49.552
MATT: You guys watch as Grog is standing there,
his body shakes and shimmers, and you watch

00:40:49.552 --> 00:40:54.963
various veins that usually bulge in his rage and
enhance blood flow of his combat just (bursts and

00:40:54.963 --> 00:40:59.423
splatters) bursts in places. And blood just seems
to spray out of him from multiple positions on his

00:40:59.423 --> 00:41:04.227
body. &nbsp;And you see the blood now leaking all over
him. He's just covered in his own crimson.

00:41:04.227 --> 00:41:07.667
He slowly turns around, prepares himself for the
next round of combat.

00:41:07.667 --> 00:41:09.779
LIAM: That is some North Star shit.

00:41:09.779 --> 00:41:10.784
MARISHA: Oh, my god.

00:41:10.784 --> 00:41:11.852
TALIESIN: Nice.

00:41:11.852 --> 00:41:24.494
TRAVIS: Yeah. Yeah. Okay. (exhales) Good deal.
Tight. Wow, distance doesn't help. Okay.

00:41:24.550 --> 00:41:29.324
LAURA: Can you talk to him? (louder) Can you talk
to him?

00:41:29.324 --> 00:41:35.293
TRAVIS: I just look up, covered like Carrie,
in the movie. Just dripping with fake blood.

00:41:35.293 --> 00:41:40.135
LAURA: Never mind! You're doing great, Grog! Keep
going. (whispers) He looks like shit.

00:41:40.135 --> 00:41:41.660
MARISHA: (whispers) He does.

00:41:41.660 --> 00:41:49.807
SAM: Sometimes music calms the savage beast.
You could sing to him.

00:41:49.807 --> 00:41:55.324
TRAVIS: I would try Intimidating Presence,
but he'll just shrug it off because he's amazing.

00:41:55.324 --> 00:41:58.607
LIAM: It's fine, it looks like he's going to
rally. Here it comes.

00:41:58.607 --> 00:42:03.226
TRAVIS: I just take off straight for him.

00:42:03.226 --> 00:42:15.334
MATT: Okay, you turn around--(counting) You just
get into melee with him.

00:42:15.334 --> 00:42:23.436
TRAVIS: Cool. Awesome. I am going to take all
three attacks at Great Weapon Master at him.

00:42:23.436 --> 00:42:25.385
NOT Reckless.

00:42:25.385 --> 00:42:28.850
MATT: Okay! Go and make your attacks at
disadvantage.

00:42:28.850 --> 00:42:31.413
LAURA and TRAVIS: Why?!

00:42:31.413 --> 00:42:32.999
TRAVIS: Because I'm covered in blood?

00:42:32.999 --> 00:42:36.375
MATT: No. Because he used his Patient Defense.

00:42:36.375 --> 00:42:38.999
SAM: Patient Defense.

00:42:38.999 --> 00:42:40.557
MATT: Essentially with each blow that you--

00:42:40.557 --> 00:42:41.636
LAURA: Oh, that's fun.

00:42:41.636 --> 00:42:43.915
MATT:--swing towards him, he's just prepared
himself from a defensive position, to prepare

00:42:43.915 --> 00:42:48.711
himself. And he's using your own momentum against
you to sway every attack away from him. So make

00:42:48.711 --> 00:42:50.689
all of your attacks at disadvantage.

00:42:50.689 --> 00:42:55.926
TRAVIS: So that's pretty smart. I threw that
literally into the holder and it was on an edge.

00:42:55.926 --> 00:43:03.284
Shit. That's a natural 20 that's going to be
replaced by a not as great (inhales sharply).

00:43:03.284 --> 00:43:07.941
23 minus five. So, it'll be a dud.

00:43:07.941 --> 00:43:12.953
MATT: Nope. So the first blow swings wide.
He grabs the actual side of the hammer with both

00:43:12.953 --> 00:43:16.256
hands and just (whooshes) throws it off to the
side.

00:43:16.256 --> 00:43:25.150
TRAVIS: Okay, okay. 31 minus five. 26.

00:43:25.150 --> 00:43:25.792
SAM: Ooh.

00:43:25.792 --> 00:43:29.531
MATT: 26. He attempts to parry this one, however,
your sheer force of strength manages to push past

00:43:29.531 --> 00:43:33.312
his grasp, and you bring the hammer down towards
his clavicle. Go ahead and roll damage.

00:43:33.312 --> 00:43:39.835
TRAVIS: (exhales) Oh, thank god. (high pitched) I
like it when I hit them. (normal voice) That's 28

00:43:39.835 --> 00:43:45.475
plus enlarge. Which I've been forgetting. 20.

00:43:45.475 --> 00:43:50.307
MATT: 20!

00:43:50.307 --> 00:43:52.653
LAURA: 18 and 10? Because of your--

00:43:52.653 --> 00:43:55.204
TRAVIS: 18 plus 10 for Great Weapon Master. 28.
30.

00:43:55.204 --> 00:43:56.793
LAURA: 30? You said 20.

00:43:56.793 --> 00:43:58.220
TRAVIS: I said 20 I meant 30.

00:43:58.220 --> 00:43:59.176
LAURA: It's 30.

00:43:59.176 --> 00:44:00.381
MATT: You mean 30.

00:44:00.381 --> 00:44:03.165
TRAVIS: My apologies. He is hitting me really,
really hard.

00:44:03.165 --> 00:44:06.522
LAURA: Yeah. And your brain is already so little.

00:44:06.522 --> 00:44:08.926
TRAVIS: It's actually large, it just doesn't do
much.

00:44:08.926 --> 00:44:10.891
MATT: And if you're using your bonus action,
you can get one more strike in.

00:44:10.891 --> 00:44:13.167
TRAVIS: I would like to. At disadvantage.

00:44:13.167 --> 00:44:15.552
MATT: Go for it.

00:44:15.552 --> 00:44:17.530
TRAVIS: That's a one.

00:44:17.530 --> 00:44:21.749
MATT: Nope. So, the second one does hit the
clavicle, and it cracks and he (grunts).

00:44:21.749 --> 00:44:26.036
You see a little bit of blood spill out the
corner of his mouth down his chin. And he looks up

00:44:26.036 --> 00:44:32.759
at you, and for a second there, the whites of his
eyes seem to almost dim ever so slightly into a

00:44:32.759 --> 00:44:37.378
moment of humanity you haven't seen in him yet.
He's been this godlike entity and this is the

00:44:37.378 --> 00:44:44.398
first point where you see that pain show just a
hint of any sort of weakening. And he kinda looks

00:44:44.398 --> 00:44:50.099
right up into you. "Good. Good." And as you go for
your third strike he literally puts up his hand

00:44:50.099 --> 00:44:52.396
and (heavy impact) catches the hammer in place.

00:44:52.396 --> 00:44:54.228
TRAVIS: Oh, god, it's so awesome!

00:44:54.228 --> 00:44:58.846
MATT: He just holds it there as he stares at you.

00:44:58.846 --> 00:45:04.663
TRAVIS: (groans) Yeah, I'm checking reflexes.

00:45:04.663 --> 00:45:05.799
MATT: Good.

00:45:05.799 --> 00:45:10.492
TRAVIS: I want you to know I'm not afraid to go
down.

00:45:10.492 --> 00:45:17.618
MATT: That is the first lesson. Let's see if your
words can be put into practice.

00:45:17.618 --> 00:45:20.483
TRAVIS: Oh shit.

00:45:20.483 --> 00:45:21.708
MARISHA: Good night!

00:45:21.708 --> 00:45:22.854
LAURA: No! No!

00:45:22.854 --> 00:45:24.965
MARISHA: We'll see you in the morning, sleep well
friends.

00:45:24.965 --> 00:45:29.931
TRAVIS: I hope you get a popcorn kernel in your
teeth.

00:45:30.099 --> 00:45:32.002
MATT: He is going to, let's see...

00:45:32.002 --> 00:45:33.835
LIAM: Go Cobra Kai on your ass.

00:45:33.835 --> 00:45:34.856
TALIESIN: Cobra Kai.

00:45:34.856 --> 00:45:36.101
TRAVIS: Sweep the leg, Johnny!

00:45:36.101 --> 00:45:37.256
TALIESIN: Never dies.

00:45:37.256 --> 00:45:41.236
LIAM: Put him in a bodybag!

00:45:41.236 --> 00:45:47.772
MATT: Yeah, he's going to go into a flurry of
blows against you. That's a natural 20.

00:45:47.772 --> 00:45:49.393
TRAVIS: (groans)

00:45:49.393 --> 00:45:51.442
MATT: That is a 18?

00:45:51.442 --> 00:45:52.821
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:45:52.821 --> 00:45:54.359
MATT: That is a 26.

00:45:54.359 --> 00:45:55.769
TRAVIS: Okay, all hit!

00:45:55.769 --> 00:46:00.644
MATT: Yeah, those all hit, okay. So the first one
is 18, reduced to half, is nine.

00:46:00.644 --> 00:46:02.294
TRAVIS: Nine, okay.

00:46:02.294 --> 00:46:04.849
MATT: That is a nine, reduced to half, five.

00:46:04.849 --> 00:46:07.241
TRAVIS: Okay.

00:46:07.241 --> 00:46:09.438
MATT: That is a 12 reduced to six.

00:46:09.438 --> 00:46:10.635
TRAVIS: Okay.

00:46:10.635 --> 00:46:12.920
MATT: And that is a 13 reduced to seven.

00:46:12.920 --> 00:46:15.253
TRAVIS: Sweet. Real excited.

00:46:15.253 --> 00:46:20.060
MATT: And he's just going to go ahead and rotate
around you to the opposite side. As he turns

00:46:20.060 --> 00:46:23.171
around (punch sounds), hitting you as he goes with
each hit.

00:46:23.171 --> 00:46:25.925
TRAVIS: (grunts, spurting blood noise)

00:46:25.925 --> 00:46:32.318
MATT: I need you to go ahead and make a strength
saving throw.

00:46:32.371 --> 00:46:33.973
You have advantage on these because
you're raging.

00:46:33.973 --> 00:46:36.087
TRAVIS: Yeah, I know. But I still have minus two
to them.

00:46:36.087 --> 00:46:37.493
MATT: This is true.

00:46:37.493 --> 00:46:39.806
LAURA: Minus two?

00:46:39.806 --> 00:46:41.543
LIAM: It's going to knock the beard off your
face.

00:46:41.543 --> 00:46:46.316
TRAVIS: That's better. 23 minus two, 21.

00:46:46.316 --> 00:46:51.980
MATT: 21, okay, yeah. So, the last blow,
as he comes round (punch noise), does a

00:46:51.980 --> 00:46:54.941
roundhouse kick and brings back and goes for a
huge double-fisted

00:46:54.941 --> 00:46:57.362
kind of earth-side punch into
your torso.

00:46:57.362 --> 00:46:58.697
TRAVIS: Not the double fist!

00:46:58.697 --> 00:47:00.957
MATT: It's about to push you backward, but you dig
in your feet (grunts)

00:47:00.957 --> 00:47:02.344
and resist it and hold your place.

00:47:02.344 --> 00:47:03.996
LAURA: Yeah!

00:47:03.996 --> 00:47:08.034
TRAVIS: Look who's catching who now.

00:47:08.034 --> 00:47:09.603
MATT: Now it's your turn.

00:47:09.603 --> 00:47:18.069
TRAVIS: He didn't have a quip back for me, okay.
Right. I would like to turn so I'm facing him.

00:47:18.069 --> 00:47:24.204
MATT: Okay.

00:47:24.204 --> 00:47:27.654
TRAVIS: I want to pick him up and try and bodyslam
him.

00:47:27.654 --> 00:47:31.304
MATT: Okay! Go ahead and make an athletics check.

00:47:31.304 --> 00:47:37.891
TRAVIS: Okay. 24.

00:47:37.891 --> 00:47:39.645
MATT: No, that's a 30 acrobatics.

00:47:39.645 --> 00:47:41.411
(everyone gasps)

00:47:41.411 --> 00:47:46.416
MATT: You go to grab, and he steps back with his
arms still crossed, leaps onto your hands as you

00:47:46.416 --> 00:47:52.538
reach out for him, and just jumps in the air,
looks down at you before he comes landing right

00:47:52.538 --> 00:47:56.632
on top of your hands (bam), forcing your fists
into the dirt.

00:47:56.632 --> 00:47:58.629
What are you going to do for your
next attack?

00:47:58.629 --> 00:48:03.943
TRAVIS: I almost drop out of my rage because that
was a real dick move, just dunking on me.

00:48:03.943 --> 00:48:05.492
LAURA: He's jumping and crossing his arms--

00:48:05.492 --> 00:48:13.123
TRAVIS: He did the Kill Bill on my hands.
I want to try one more time.

00:48:13.123 --> 00:48:18.473
MATT: All right, roll again.

00:48:18.473 --> 00:48:19.707
TRAVIS: 20.

00:48:19.707 --> 00:48:23.530
MATT: Remember, you have advantage on these
because you're raging.

00:48:23.530 --> 00:48:24.812
TRAVIS: It doesn't matter.

00:48:24.812 --> 00:48:32.161
MATT: Okay, that's a 24 acrobatics. As you pull
your hands up out of the dirt reaching out for him

00:48:32.161 --> 00:48:38.027
with these giant Titanstone gauntlet-encrusted
fingers (groans), and the sand burst goes upwards,

00:48:38.027 --> 00:48:44.830
you reach, and find nothing but sand. And as the
sand fades, he uses his-- Is this the end of your

00:48:44.830 --> 00:48:46.550
turn, because you still have a bonus action.

00:48:46.550 --> 00:48:47.701
TRAVIS: I still have a third one, yeah.

00:48:47.701 --> 00:48:50.082
MATT: Okay, so as the sand is still cascading,
now you can see his shape through it, what are

00:48:50.082 --> 00:48:52.793
you doing with your third strike?

00:48:52.793 --> 00:48:55.363
TRAVIS: I just want to try and grab a hold of the
slippery bastard.

00:48:55.363 --> 00:48:57.004
MATT: Okay, one more time.

00:48:57.004 --> 00:48:59.844
TRAVIS: Yeah. Strength, advantage or just natural
roll?

00:48:59.844 --> 00:49:01.157
MATT: Advantage on your athletics.

00:49:01.157 --> 00:49:03.517
TRAVIS: Okay.

00:49:03.517 --> 00:49:08.172
LIAM: God, it probably looks like he's running in
circles to us.

00:49:08.172 --> 00:49:09.837
TRAVIS: 26.

00:49:09.837 --> 00:49:11.210
MATT: He only rolled 24.

00:49:11.210 --> 00:49:12.247
LAURA: (gasps)

00:49:12.247 --> 00:49:15.833
MATT: With the sand there, kind of coming down
from the impact of you pulling your fists out,

00:49:15.833 --> 00:49:20.350
you reach out and finally they find purchase on
the sides of his arms. And doing so, you (boom)

00:49:20.350 --> 00:49:24.532
pull him in, and grasp him right to your chest.
The hammer still clutched in your right hand,

00:49:24.532 --> 00:49:29.943
and you watch as he (grunts) gets pulled in now,
and he is firmly in your grasp,

00:49:29.943 --> 00:49:31.747
he is currently grappled.

00:49:31.747 --> 00:49:34.668
TRAVIS: Cool. I don't say anything, I'm just
really stoked that I actually got him.

00:49:34.668 --> 00:49:36.822
(everyone laughs)

00:49:36.822 --> 00:49:39.126
TRAVIS: I'm like, take a picture! Whatever that
is!

00:49:39.126 --> 00:49:43.696
LAURA: Draw it! Draw it! Quick, Percy! Should I
flash him? Should I flash him?

00:49:43.696 --> 00:49:45.054
TALIESIN: It couldn't hurt.

00:49:45.054 --> 00:49:47.496
MATT: You want to make this into a bodyslam?

00:49:47.496 --> 00:49:48.248
TRAVIS: Could I?

00:49:48.248 --> 00:49:49.108
MARISHA Couldn't hurt the rest of us, either!

00:49:49.116 --> 00:49:51.002
MATT: I'll let you, sure. Okay.

00:49:51.053 --> 00:49:55.480
TRAVIS: I was thinking initially I'd like to
remove one of his five hits that he takes on me,

00:49:55.532 --> 00:49:57.993
but, four, who gives a shit.

00:49:57.993 --> 00:50:00.759
MATT: We'll say for the purposes of this,
since your intent was to bodyslam him, go ahead

00:50:00.759 --> 00:50:02.492
and roll an attack with disadvantage.

00:50:02.492 --> 00:50:08.529
TRAVIS: Okay, attack with disadvantage. That's not
that great. Oh, regular attack!

00:50:08.529 --> 00:50:14.087
MATT: It's without your weapon bonus. It's minus
3.

00:50:14.087 --> 00:50:17.173
TRAVIS: Yeah, 22.

00:50:17.173 --> 00:50:23.045
MATT: 22. You grab him and you lift, and it's like
he's anchored to the ground. He's much smaller

00:50:23.045 --> 00:50:28.295
than you, and you can lift things far larger and
denser than him, but for some reason, he won't

00:50:28.295 --> 00:50:35.137
budge an inch. He's just staring up at you,
with his arms pressed to his sides.

00:50:35.137 --> 00:50:37.018
MARISHA: I want to learn that trick.

00:50:37.018 --> 00:50:39.754
TRAVIS: I've still got him grappled at least.
That's it.

00:50:39.754 --> 00:50:41.066
MATT: All right.

00:50:41.066 --> 00:50:44.287
LAURA: You have to be crouched down in order to be
grappling him?

00:50:44.287 --> 00:50:45.313
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:50:45.313 --> 00:50:47.004
MARISHA: It's like the possum trick.

00:50:47.004 --> 00:50:51.177
TRAVIS: Let's just assume that I picked him up.
I'm just holding him grappled.

00:50:51.177 --> 00:50:52.545
Or am I squatting?

00:50:52.545 --> 00:50:53.888
MATT: You're squatting down and grappling him.

00:50:53.888 --> 00:50:56.563
You went to lift him up but (grunts) he wouldn't
budge.

00:50:56.563 --> 00:50:58.467
TRAVIS: Hugging Santa's little helper.

00:50:58.467 --> 00:51:01.266
LIAM: He's friggin third Hokage, man. He's not
going anywhere.

00:51:01.266 --> 00:51:03.244
MATT: As you're holding him, he closes his eyes.

00:51:03.244 --> 00:51:04.664
TRAVIS: He closes his eyes?

00:51:04.664 --> 00:51:09.227
MATT: And you watch as this kind of warm
orange-ish white energy begins to just emanate--

00:51:09.227 --> 00:51:10.645
LARUA: (gasps) He's going super saiyan!

00:51:10.645 --> 00:51:13.286
MATT: --from various parts in his body. Just here,
in the middle of the forehead a little glimmer

00:51:13.286 --> 00:51:15.081
opens here, a little glimmer in the shoulder--

00:51:15.081 --> 00:51:16.492
MARISHA: He's over 9000!

00:51:16.492 --> 00:51:19.677
MATT: --his various chakra points begin to glow.
And you watch as many of the bruises and

00:51:19.677 --> 00:51:22.931
bludgeons that you put upon his body, and cuts
begin to heal up.

00:51:22.931 --> 00:51:25.020
LAURA: Shit.

00:51:25.020 --> 00:51:28.332
LIAM: I want to be at level 21.

00:51:28.332 --> 00:51:32.114
SAM: That's 20 more levels.

00:51:32.114 --> 00:51:34.549
LIAM: Four more years of this.

00:51:34.549 --> 00:51:46.456
MATT: (laughs) And he can't move, he's currently
grappled. All right, so that's his turn.

00:51:46.456 --> 00:51:47.863
You go ahead.

00:51:47.863 --> 00:51:49.119
TRAVIS: I still have him grappled?

00:51:49.119 --> 00:51:50.302
MATT: You still have him grappled.

00:51:50.302 --> 00:51:53.070
TRAVIS: I still want to try to get him to the
ground. I want to try and get him prone.

00:51:53.070 --> 00:51:59.321
Can I try a leg wrap, so I'm gonna wrap my right
leg around his, and dive forward. Trying to push

00:51:59.321 --> 00:52:01.773
him off-balance on to his back.

00:52:01.773 --> 00:52:03.932
MATT: I'll say go ahead and make another athletics
check.

00:52:03.932 --> 00:52:10.923
TRAVIS: Okay. 24.

00:52:10.923 --> 00:52:15.555
MATT: 24, he got a 21. So we'll say for this,
you go ahead, you'll be releasing the grapple,

00:52:15.555 --> 00:52:20.566
but you slam him on the ground and make him
prone. So you manage to just (grunts) rip him off

00:52:20.566 --> 00:52:24.726
of whatever weird center of gravity he's forced
himself into, lift him over your head, and just

00:52:24.726 --> 00:52:26.573
pile-drive him into the ground.

00:52:26.573 --> 00:52:27.251
TRAVIS: Great.

00:52:27.251 --> 00:52:32.625
MATT: (boom) Once again, you see sand and dust
kick up, and then you see these two legs sticking

00:52:32.625 --> 00:52:36.255
up as you've basically planted him in the ground
like a carrot.

00:52:36.255 --> 00:52:39.401
And he is currently prone on the
ground, yes.

00:52:39.401 --> 00:52:43.528
TRAVIS: Great! When he's prone, do I get advantage
on attacks?

00:52:43.528 --> 00:52:46.924
MATT: When he is prone, attack rolls against the
creature have advantage

00:52:46.924 --> 00:52:48.815
if you're within five feet, so yes you do.

00:52:48.815 --> 00:52:52.637
TRAVIS: Great. Great Weapon Master, dwarven
thrower, and I say

00:52:52.637 --> 00:52:55.349
I want to know the answer to the lesson!

00:52:55.349 --> 00:53:04.563
(everyone laughs)

00:53:04.563 --> 00:53:07.488
TRAVIS: 29 minus five, 24?

00:53:07.488 --> 00:53:08.772
MATT: 24, that hits.

00:53:08.772 --> 00:53:09.680
TRAVIS: Okay.

00:53:09.680 --> 00:53:11.175
LIAM: Get him, big man!

00:53:11.175 --> 00:53:15.965
MARISHA: Give him the chair!

00:53:15.965 --> 00:53:19.359
TRAVIS: 35.

00:53:19.359 --> 00:53:20.960
MATT: 35.

00:53:20.960 --> 00:53:22.812
TRAVIS: Plus the enlarge damage.

00:53:22.812 --> 00:53:28.054
MATT: Nice! Okay, that's your second attack.

00:53:28.054 --> 00:53:33.815
TRAVIS: Uh, 28 minus five, 23.

00:53:33.815 --> 00:53:38.187
MATT: 23 just hits.

00:53:38.187 --> 00:53:46.667
TRAVIS: 9, 24, 34, 38.

00:53:46.667 --> 00:53:54.267
MATT: 38, oof! All righty. So as you're shouting
this the first blow comes down (whack), you're not

00:53:54.267 --> 00:53:58.843
even seeing him or seeing the impact, all you're
seeing is sand and fury. The second and final

00:53:58.843 --> 00:54:03.366
blow, you bring up, and as you bring it down you
feel something (crack) crack underneath.

00:54:03.366 --> 00:54:08.480
And you watch as you pull the hammer up again,
he pushes off, and he's gonna actually use it at

00:54:08.480 --> 00:54:10.973
the end of your turn-- are you going to move?

00:54:10.973 --> 00:54:13.376
TRAVIS: (laughs)

00:54:13.376 --> 00:54:15.083
MATT: It's up to you, you can stay where you are.

00:54:15.083 --> 00:54:18.240
TRAVIS: No, I would be right there, just entranced
that he's actually in the ground.

00:54:18.240 --> 00:54:20.790
MATT: Okay. So at the end of your turn he's going
to go ahead

00:54:20.790 --> 00:54:23.990
and use a legendary action to attack you.

00:54:23.990 --> 00:54:25.619
TRAVIS: I meant 'I run'!

00:54:25.619 --> 00:54:31.685
MATT: It's a 30. So it hits you. All right,
that's 18, halved to nine,

00:54:31.685 --> 00:54:33.538
take nine points of damage.

00:54:33.538 --> 00:54:34.656
TRAVIS: Okay.

00:54:34.656 --> 00:54:42.587
MATT: And I need you to make another constitution
saving throw.

00:54:42.587 --> 00:54:46.499
TRAVIS: Okay. Natural 20!

00:54:46.499 --> 00:54:53.038
MATT: Sick, okay! As you pull up from the hammer,
you can see now, there's quite a bit of blood now

00:54:53.038 --> 00:54:57.705
out of his mouth, and there's a part of the chest
where it's pushed in, and you can see where the

00:54:57.705 --> 00:55:01.962
impact has caused heavy bruising and parts of the
skin have broken open from impact. So now he's

00:55:01.962 --> 00:55:04.680
bleeding in places. You're bleeding all over the
place.

00:55:04.680 --> 00:55:05.824
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah!

00:55:05.824 --> 00:55:09.855
MATT: So it's just this mess of two somewhat
dressed humanoid men

00:55:09.855 --> 00:55:11.325
covered in their own blood. It's delightful.

00:55:11.325 --> 00:55:12.542
TRAVIS: And blood and sand.

00:55:12.542 --> 00:55:14.489
MATT: Yeah, blood and sand. It's encrusted
everywhere.

00:55:14.489 --> 00:55:18.773
MARISHA: Be careful, that's how blood diseases are
transferred!

00:55:18.773 --> 00:55:20.404
TALIESIN: Very filthy.

00:55:20.404 --> 00:55:21.425
MARISHA: Be careful!

00:55:21.425 --> 00:55:22.442
SAM: Sepsis!

00:55:22.442 --> 00:55:27.107
MATT: He pushes off and manages to hit you in the
sternum once again, the same place where the

00:55:27.107 --> 00:55:32.121
vibrations hit. However this time you grab his
hand as it gets there, and it still hits you,

00:55:32.121 --> 00:55:37.363
but the gauntlets absorb the impact and prevent
it from spreading through your body. That ends

00:55:37.363 --> 00:55:42.528
your turn. It's now his turn. He stands up from
prone.

00:55:42.528 --> 00:55:44.871
TRAVIS: Goddamn, he did that to me on my turn.

00:55:44.871 --> 00:55:45.895
MATT: Yeah.

00:55:45.895 --> 00:55:47.869
TRAVIS: (laughing) That's fucked up.

00:55:47.869 --> 00:55:50.443
(everyone laughs)

00:55:50.443 --> 00:55:56.088
TRAVIS: Holy shit. Natural 20 on my turn,
saved my life.

00:55:56.088 --> 00:56:02.851
MATT: Okay, he's going to go ahead and hit you
twice (punch sounds). That is an 18?

00:56:02.851 --> 00:56:03.992
TRAVIS: Hits.

00:56:03.992 --> 00:56:12.408
MATT: And a 20. So yeah, so the first one--I need
you to make a constitution saving throw.

00:56:12.408 --> 00:56:13.986
TRAVIS: Okay.

00:56:13.986 --> 00:56:18.917
MATT: And you take 14 reduced to half, seven
points of bludgeoning damage.

00:56:18.917 --> 00:56:21.135
TRAVIS: Uh, 13 on my constitution saving throw.

00:56:21.135 --> 00:56:22.106
MATT: 13.

00:56:22.106 --> 00:56:23.641
TRAVIS: What was the damage? I'm sorry.

00:56:23.641 --> 00:56:24.296
MATT: Seven.

00:56:24.296 --> 00:56:25.688
TRAVIS: Seven.

00:56:25.688 --> 00:56:28.540
MATT: You feel your muscles lock up once more,
and you're stunned now.

00:56:28.540 --> 00:56:29.532
TRAVIS: Awesome.

00:56:29.532 --> 00:56:34.408
MATT: That allows his attack, and since you are
stunned, attacks against you have advantage,

00:56:34.408 --> 00:56:38.598
and you are incapacitated, so hits that are
against you are technically all crits.

00:56:38.598 --> 00:56:41.348
TRAVIS: Oh, fuck!

00:56:41.348 --> 00:56:44.890
MATT: So the next hit that went against you is six
plus eight--

00:56:44.890 --> 00:56:47.020
TRAVIS: Can I smile before he hits me?

00:56:47.020 --> 00:56:51.855
MATT: Sure, you go. So you feel as your body locks
up, the next hit (whack) goes right into the same

00:56:51.855 --> 00:56:55.251
place where he keeps hitting you in the sternum.
You can feel the bruising, now you hear the

00:56:55.251 --> 00:57:02.194
(crack) crack inward as you feel the cartilage
there pop inward. That's the second hit.

00:57:02.194 --> 00:57:07.782
He goes in for two more strikes now as you're
stunned. (whoof) The next one, the third one,

00:57:07.782 --> 00:57:13.611
that's going to be a 27? That is eight plus
eight, you take eight damage because it's halved.

00:57:13.611 --> 00:57:22.864
So take eight bludgeoning damage. And his final
hit, that is going to be a 30. That is going to be

00:57:22.864 --> 00:57:26.747
a 6, 12, 20, reduce that to ten bludgeoning
damage.

00:57:26.747 --> 00:57:28.427
TRAVIS: Cool! Great!

00:57:28.427 --> 00:57:30.457
LIAM: Still standing.

00:57:30.457 --> 00:57:38.497
TRAVIS: My math is probably wrong but I'm getting
down there.

00:57:38.497 --> 00:57:46.121
MATT: Okay. He's going to stand right there.
Your turn.

00:57:46.121 --> 00:57:47.352
TRAVIS: He is.

00:57:47.352 --> 00:57:48.457
MATT: Yep.

00:57:48.457 --> 00:57:50.463
LAURA: Oh my god.

00:57:50.463 --> 00:57:51.518
MATT: What are you going to do?

00:57:51.518 --> 00:57:53.420
TRAVIS: Did he just stand there, and he had a
turn?

00:57:53.420 --> 00:57:57.746
MATT: He just went. He got up from prone,
that's half his movement, and he's not going to

00:57:57.746 --> 00:58:05.123
move around you, he's staying right where he is.
What do you do?

00:58:05.123 --> 00:58:18.240
MARISHA: Show him what you've learned! None of us
know what you learned though! We can't help you!

00:58:18.240 --> 00:58:33.253
TRAVIS: I feel like he's doing that Patient
Defense thing again. Yeah, fuck it. I'm going to

00:58:33.253 --> 00:58:38.828
go for broke. Because we're pretty close anyway.
I'm gonna make

00:58:38.828 --> 00:58:43.252
all three attacks reckless, Great Weapon Master.

00:58:43.252 --> 00:58:46.008
MATT: Okay! Go for it.

00:58:46.008 --> 00:58:48.957
LIAM: Tripling down on the barbarian.

00:58:48.957 --> 00:58:51.609
TRAVIS: (laughing) I don't know any better,
I don't know.

00:58:51.609 --> 00:58:53.595
MATT: Oh no, actually, you're stunned this turn.

00:58:53.595 --> 00:58:54.446
TRAVIS: Oh!

00:58:54.446 --> 00:58:55.615
MATT: I just remembered that.

00:58:55.615 --> 00:58:56.896
LAURA: Fuck!

00:58:56.896 --> 00:59:00.234
MATT: So, you grin, and then (grunts) your body
just won't respond.

00:59:00.234 --> 00:59:02.248
TRAVIS: Is there a small fart at least?

00:59:02.248 --> 00:59:04.423
LIAM: (high-pitched fart noise)

00:59:04.423 --> 00:59:05.591
MATT: It's about that.

00:59:05.591 --> 00:59:09.696
TRAVIS: Yep. It's not even like something to be
proud of. Just a little squeaker.

00:59:09.696 --> 00:59:12.111
LAURA: Oh, did you just poop your pants?

00:59:12.111 --> 00:59:15.058
LIAM: You turtle a little bit?

00:59:15.058 --> 00:59:20.469
TRAVIS: (Scottish accent) A little turtle head
poking out. (Normal voice) So I'm stunned--

00:59:20.469 --> 00:59:24.548
MATT: You're stunned until the end of your turn.
Your turn ends, at the end of your turn he's

00:59:24.548 --> 00:59:27.528
going to use one of his legendary actions to use
Like The Wind, and he gets to move his speed

00:59:27.528 --> 00:59:32.984
without attacks of opportunity.

00:59:32.984 --> 00:59:36.399
LAURA: What does he want from you?

00:59:36.399 --> 00:59:38.315
TALIESIN: For you to show him what you learned.

00:59:38.315 --> 00:59:40.657
MATT: He just (whoosh) slips back and he's on the
opposite side, and just goes.

00:59:40.657 --> 00:59:46.223
TRAVIS: Cool. I look back, and do this.

00:59:46.223 --> 00:59:48.802
SAM: Ooh! He learned to be a dick!

00:59:48.802 --> 00:59:54.012
(everyone laughs)

00:59:54.012 --> 00:59:55.369
MATT: That's your turn?

00:59:55.369 --> 00:59:56.270
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:59:56.270 --> 01:00:05.384
MATT: Okay. He begins to rotate. Over there...
and that's his turn.

01:00:05.453 --> 01:00:08.355
SAM: You have a healing--

01:00:08.355 --> 01:00:12.182
MARISHA: Everyone is doing their Keanu
impressions.

01:00:12.182 --> 01:00:13.709
TRAVIS: I have no healing anythings.

01:00:13.709 --> 01:00:14.539
SAM: Awesome.

01:00:14.539 --> 01:00:16.931
TRAVIS: I do if I
short rest, but that's it. All right--

01:00:16.931 --> 01:00:18.435
SAM: Ooh, take one.

01:00:18.435 --> 01:00:19.731
LIAM: I do to Keyleth.

01:00:19.731 --> 01:00:22.743
TRAVIS: How
far can I throw this fucking thing? Long range of

01:00:22.743 --> 01:00:27.652
60 feet. The long range of 60 feet means that it
would be a disadvantage throw?

01:00:27.652 --> 01:00:30.262
MATT: Correct.

01:00:30.262 --> 01:00:32.587
TRAVIS: That's not great.

01:00:32.587 --> 01:00:34.424
MATT: Short range
is 20?

01:00:34.424 --> 01:00:35.987
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:00:35.987 --> 01:00:38.105
MATT: Just get up within 20 feet of him.

01:00:38.105 --> 01:00:42.145
TRAVIS: Yeah, let's be honest.
Could I get to him in 50 feet?

01:00:42.145 --> 01:00:43.903
MATT: You wanna try?

01:00:43.956 --> 01:00:45.608
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'd like to try.

01:00:45.608 --> 01:00:58.614
MATT: (counting) You just barely get up to him.

01:00:58.614 --> 01:01:02.779
TRAVIS: God! I just wanna keep staring back at
him but I don't-- There's no point to it.

01:01:02.779 --> 01:01:06.296
I can't do anything. It's not like I can psych
him out or--

01:01:06.296 --> 01:01:07.866
LAURA: Tell him what you learned!

01:01:07.866 --> 01:01:11.575
(all laugh)

01:01:11.575 --> 01:01:12.722
MATT: What are you gonna
do?

01:01:12.722 --> 01:01:14.526
SAM: Vague words of encouragement!

01:01:14.526 --> 01:01:16.327
(all laugh)

01:01:16.327 --> 01:01:18.877
TRAVIS: Yeah, going for broke again.
Reckless, great weapon master, all three.

01:01:18.877 --> 01:01:19.534
MATT: Okay.

01:01:19.534 --> 01:01:20.256
TRAVIS: Okay.

01:01:20.256 --> 01:01:21.778
MATT: You have
disadvantage on them because of his Patient

01:01:21.778 --> 01:01:23.791
Defense, so they're just straight rolls.

01:01:23.791 --> 01:01:25.921
TRAVIS: Spatial-- Patient Defense.

01:01:25.921 --> 01:01:27.757
MATT: Patient Defense, yes.

01:01:27.757 --> 01:01:30.640
TRAVIS: Also known as
spatial defense in the barbarian world.

01:01:30.640 --> 01:01:33.442
LAURA: Totally. (gasps)

01:01:33.442 --> 01:01:35.078
TRAVIS: Natural 20.

01:01:35.078 --> 01:01:36.044
MARISHA: Ooh.

01:01:36.044 --> 01:01:37.321
MATT: Okay.

01:01:37.321 --> 01:01:38.895
LIAM: Just two more of those, please.

01:01:38.895 --> 01:01:52.533
TRAVIS: So I double the damage die-- or I 
roll two more damage dice after this.

01:01:52.533 --> 01:01:55.233
LAURA: Are you supposed to roll
10's or 12's?

01:01:55.233 --> 01:01:56.471
MATT: 10's for the hammer.

01:01:56.471 --> 01:01:57.221
LAURA: Okay.

01:01:57.221 --> 01:02:01.861
TRAVIS: 42.

01:02:01.861 --> 01:02:04.415
MATT: 42 points of
damage on the first one, ooh.

01:02:04.415 --> 01:02:05.960
LAURA: (quietly) That's good, that's good.

01:02:05.960 --> 01:02:07.145
TRAVIS: Second one.

01:02:07.145 --> 01:02:11.793
MATT: Second attack.

01:02:11.964 --> 01:02:13.883
TRAVIS: That's a 31 minus five, 26?

01:02:13.883 --> 01:02:15.797
MATT: 26 hits.

01:02:15.797 --> 01:02:22.626
TRAVIS: (counting) 35.

01:02:22.626 --> 01:02:23.618
MATT: 35 points
of damage?

01:02:23.618 --> 01:02:24.515
TRAVIS: Yep.

01:02:24.515 --> 01:02:25.609
MATT: Oof.

01:02:25.609 --> 01:02:26.458
TRAVIS: Last one.

01:02:26.458 --> 01:02:27.601
LAURA, SAM, and MARISHA: (clap)

01:02:27.601 --> 01:02:29.076
MATT: Last attack.

01:02:29.076 --> 01:02:38.103
TRAVIS: I'm buying a ticket to the
no pants dance after this. 20, 22.

01:02:38.103 --> 01:02:39.320
MATT: 22, no.

01:02:39.320 --> 01:02:40.319
LAURA: (groan)

01:02:40.319 --> 01:02:42.096
TRAVIS: Oh no no, that's not
minus five-- it is minus five.

01:02:42.096 --> 01:02:44.062
MATT: Yeah,
it is minus five. So, you go bounding up towards

01:02:44.062 --> 01:02:49.440
him (boom boom boom). He just sits there waiting,
his arms up. The first strike, he goes to parry

01:02:49.440 --> 01:02:53.018
but as you hit (crack), his arm gets knocked out
of the way, preventing him from parrying the

01:02:53.018 --> 01:02:57.410
second strike as it comes down right across the
side of the face (boof), hitting him, you watch as

01:02:57.410 --> 01:03:02.595
blood (splattering sound) across the sand and you
see his jaw's kinda momentarily dislodged,

01:03:02.595 --> 01:03:06.863
his beard just kinda crusted in his own blood.
As you come up with a giant over-the-head blow

01:03:06.863 --> 01:03:11.982
and as it comes down, he (crack) slaps it from
both sides and stops it mid-action. You see his

01:03:11.982 --> 01:03:16.036
hands shaking as he's holding it, and he just
kinda looks up in your face,

01:03:16.036 --> 01:03:18.875
"Good. Good."

01:03:18.875 --> 01:03:21.688
TRAVIS: You keep saying that!

01:03:21.688 --> 01:03:23.196
LIAM: That
was so metal.

01:03:23.196 --> 01:03:27.645
MATT: It's now his turn. As he throws the hammer
back over your head, which puts you off-balance,

01:03:27.645 --> 01:03:34.971
he's gonna go into his first two strikes. The
first one is a 21 to hit?

01:03:34.971 --> 01:03:37.376
TRAVIS: (strained) Yes, I believe that hits.

01:03:37.376 --> 01:03:40.244
MATT: That is gonna be ten, reduced to five.

01:03:40.244 --> 01:03:40.931
TRAVIS: Okay.

01:03:40.931 --> 01:03:48.547
MATT: Second one, uh-- on the first one, I need
you to make another constitution saving throw.

01:03:48.547 --> 01:03:49.687
TRAVIS: Okay, same damage?

01:03:49.687 --> 01:03:50.724
MATT: Same damage, yeah.

01:03:50.724 --> 01:03:51.650
TRAVIS: Okay.

01:03:51.650 --> 01:03:53.233
MATT: But he's gonna do--

01:03:53.233 --> 01:03:54.070
TRAVIS: 23.

01:03:54.070 --> 01:03:54.649
MATT: 23.

01:03:54.649 --> 01:03:55.841
TRAVIS: Nope, 21.

01:03:55.841 --> 01:04:00.457
MATT: 21, that's right, yeah. So you manage
to resist, the effect of the stunning strike.

01:04:00.457 --> 01:04:02.222
He's gonna go for the secondary attack.

01:04:02.222 --> 01:04:03.277
TRAVIS: Okay.

01:04:03.277 --> 01:04:06.157
MATT: Which was seven plus 13,
it's 20, so that still hits you.

01:04:06.157 --> 01:04:07.110
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:04:07.110 --> 01:04:09.868
MATT: You take 18, reduce that to nine.

01:04:09.868 --> 01:04:11.575
TRAVIS: Oof (laughs).

01:04:11.575 --> 01:04:13.873
MATT: Make another
constitution saving throw.

01:04:13.873 --> 01:04:16.580
TRAVIS: Cool (laughs). We in the single digits,
kids.

01:04:16.580 --> 01:04:18.776
(all gasp)

01:04:18.776 --> 01:04:19.759
MARISHA: (quietly) No.

01:04:19.759 --> 01:04:21.391
TRAVIS: 22 minus two is 20.

01:04:21.391 --> 01:04:23.112
MATT: 20, you just barely shrug off
the effect of the stunning strike.

01:04:23.112 --> 01:04:24.627
(all sigh in relief)

01:04:24.627 --> 01:04:27.096
SAM: Clutch.

01:04:27.096 --> 01:04:29.978
MATT: He is gonna go in for his flurry of blows 
'cause he knows you're on the edge.

01:04:29.978 --> 01:04:31.355
LAURA: No!

01:04:31.355 --> 01:04:32.728
MATT: He knows you're on
the edge.

01:04:32.728 --> 01:04:34.038
SAM: He just has to miss four.

01:04:34.038 --> 01:04:35.119
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah.

01:04:35.119 --> 01:04:36.082
MATT: That's a
natural 20.

01:04:36.082 --> 01:04:37.221
(all gasp)

01:04:37.221 --> 01:04:38.002
MARISHA: No.

01:04:38.002 --> 01:04:38.752
TRAVIS: (laughs)

01:04:38.752 --> 01:04:40.219
SAM: Just has to miss three.

01:04:40.219 --> 01:04:45.410
MATT:That is 16 plus 8, that is 24 points of damage
reduced to half to 12.

01:04:45.410 --> 01:04:52.044
TRAVIS: I am unconscious,
but! I use my relentless rage.

01:04:52.044 --> 01:04:53.072
SAM: (growls)

01:04:53.072 --> 01:04:54.611
MATT: Right! Oh shit, okay.

01:04:54.611 --> 01:04:56.282
MARISHA: You're coming back.

01:04:56.282 --> 01:04:57.539
MATT: I forgot about that.

01:04:57.539 --> 01:04:59.194
TRAVIS: Which, it's a flurry of blows,
and he only did it on the first one.

01:04:59.194 --> 01:05:00.247
(all laugh)

01:05:00.247 --> 01:05:04.546
TRAVIS: So, I'm like (long groan,
rewind noise) Oh shit! (long groan).

01:05:04.546 --> 01:05:05.552
(all laugh)

01:05:05.552 --> 01:05:07.480
MATT: Well, you need to make a
constitution saving throw.

01:05:07.480 --> 01:05:08.349
TRAVIS: I do, yes.

01:05:08.349 --> 01:05:09.326
MATT: The DC of 10.

01:05:09.326 --> 01:05:10.257
TRAVIS: I do.

01:05:10.257 --> 01:05:11.129
MARISHA: C'mon.

01:05:11.129 --> 01:05:12.230
SAM: Phillip!

01:05:12.230 --> 01:05:13.857
TRAVIS: If I can't make a DC of 10, I don't know.

01:05:13.857 --> 01:05:14.914
LAURA: Go Phillip!

01:05:14.914 --> 01:05:15.662
LIAM: Phil!

01:05:15.662 --> 01:05:16.938
TRAVIS: Uh, 21.

01:05:16.938 --> 01:05:20.816
MATT: Okay, so the third hit, the first couple
just kinda loosen you up (pop pop)--

01:05:20.816 --> 01:05:22.640
TRAVIS: This is gonna get interesting.

01:05:22.640 --> 01:05:26.100
MATT: The third hit, he leaps in the
air, kinda Troy style (whack)

01:05:26.100 --> 01:05:27.886
and hits you right square in the face--

01:05:27.886 --> 01:05:28.827
LAURA: Superman
punch!

01:05:28.827 --> 01:05:30.875
MATT: -- up in the air and (ringing punch sound)
you kinda pull back as you feel

01:05:30.875 --> 01:05:34.910
your vision
begin to darken, and then you feel that surge of

01:05:34.910 --> 01:05:39.007
white hot rage in the back of your skull (crack)
bring you back, and you (grunt) pull back up as he

01:05:39.007 --> 01:05:45.018
lands, and you watch as his expression goes (huff)
and he darts downward and goes for a low to high

01:05:45.018 --> 01:05:48.181
ground uppercut dragon punch style.

01:05:48.181 --> 01:05:50.351
LIAM: Look out, Guile, look out.

01:05:50.351 --> 01:05:51.343
MARISHA: Oh god.

01:05:51.343 --> 01:05:53.686
MATT: That's gonna-- oh, that's an 18 plus 13,
that's a 31.

01:05:53.686 --> 01:05:54.912
(all groan)

01:05:54.912 --> 01:05:56.653
MATT: You take nine points, reduced to five.

01:05:56.653 --> 01:05:58.098
TRAVIS: (electronic
shut down noise)

01:05:58.098 --> 01:05:58.780
LAURA: No!

01:05:58.780 --> 01:05:59.815
(all laugh)

01:05:59.815 --> 01:06:01.826
MATT: (boom) Hits you right underneath the chin,
now make--

01:06:01.826 --> 01:06:04.671
TRAVIS: However, I use my relentless rage, now at
a DC 15.

01:06:04.671 --> 01:06:05.477
MATT: Correct.

01:06:05.477 --> 01:06:06.942
SAM: Whaat?

01:06:06.942 --> 01:06:07.910
LAURA: Ooh, shit.

01:06:07.910 --> 01:06:09.057
MARISHA: Come on, come on.

01:06:09.057 --> 01:06:10.397
LAURA: C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon,
c'mon.

01:06:10.397 --> 01:06:11.697
LIAM: Game that system, do it.

01:06:11.697 --> 01:06:12.506
SAM: Come on, come on.

01:06:12.506 --> 01:06:13.930
LIAM: Pull out a squeaker, Travis,
c'mon.

01:06:13.930 --> 01:06:14.533
TRAVIS: 27.

01:06:14.533 --> 01:06:15.744
SAM: Ohh!

01:06:15.744 --> 01:06:16.532
MARISHA: (claps)

01:06:16.532 --> 01:06:16.993
LAURA: (cackles)

01:06:16.993 --> 01:06:18.440
MATT: 27. As it knocks you into the air, 
almost onto

01:06:18.440 --> 01:06:22.266
your feet but you manage to catch yourself and
(groans) right back up as he lands (cracks) turns

01:06:22.266 --> 01:06:23.948
around and looks at you and goes,

01:06:23.948 --> 01:06:25.889
TRAVIS:
Good?

01:06:25.889 --> 01:06:27.536
MATT: "I see what you've learned."

01:06:27.536 --> 01:06:28.827
(all laugh)

01:06:28.827 --> 01:06:29.991
MATT: It's your turn.

01:06:29.991 --> 01:06:30.701
TRAVIS: It's my turn?

01:06:30.701 --> 01:06:31.449
MATT: It's your turn.

01:06:31.449 --> 01:06:32.539
SAM: Kill him.

01:06:32.539 --> 01:06:36.611
TRAVIS: All three, reckless, great weapon
master! Chewing my tongue off while I do it!

01:06:36.611 --> 01:06:37.646
(all laugh)

01:06:37.646 --> 01:06:38.972
MATT: Go for it.

01:06:38.972 --> 01:06:40.927
LIAM: (deep voice) Show
me what you've learned.

01:06:40.927 --> 01:06:42.452
TRAVIS and MARISHA: (deep voice)
Show me--

01:06:42.452 --> 01:06:44.765
TRAVIS: 29 minus five, 24.

01:06:44.765 --> 01:06:46.674
MATT: 24 hits.

01:06:46.674 --> 01:06:55.790
TRAVIS: Yep. So the first one is... 23, 33, 34.
34 points of damage, first one.

01:06:55.790 --> 01:06:56.784
MATT: Okay.

01:06:56.784 --> 01:06:59.229
TRAVIS: Second one, nine, damn it.

01:06:59.229 --> 01:07:00.982
TALIESIN: (high-pitched
groan)

01:07:00.982 --> 01:07:04.070
MARISHA: (whispering) Kill him.

01:07:04.070 --> 01:07:05.219
LAURA: 22.

01:07:05.219 --> 01:07:06.905
TRAVIS: No, but it's minus five so it's
20.

01:07:07.051 --> 01:07:07.685
MATT: 20.

01:07:07.761 --> 01:07:08.700
TRAVIS: Misses.

01:07:08.839 --> 01:07:11.156
MATT: So the first one hits (whack), it hits him

01:07:11.331 --> 01:07:13.444
in the side of
the head, the other side, it rights his jaw

01:07:13.444 --> 01:07:18.280
strangely but knocks him down onto three points.
He's down on his hand and his two knees in the

01:07:18.280 --> 01:07:20.425
ground, his other arm's still up, clenched in a
fist.

01:07:20.425 --> 01:07:22.954
He's breathing heavily, like he's on the edge.

01:07:22.954 --> 01:07:23.695
TRAVIS: Oh.

01:07:23.695 --> 01:07:24.815
MATT: Second strike,
you go--

01:07:24.815 --> 01:07:25.986
LAURA: Get him, Grog!

01:07:25.986 --> 01:07:26.912
MATT: -- to swing down and he rolls out
of the way

01:07:26.912 --> 01:07:29.883
(fwish, crack), hits the ground with no effect.
You're going for your third and final strike.

01:07:29.883 --> 01:07:30.604
TRAVIS: I am, yeah.

01:07:30.604 --> 01:07:31.185
MATT: Go for it

01:07:31.185 --> 01:07:32.099
MARISHA: Come on, come on.

01:07:32.099 --> 01:07:33.596
LAURA: C'mon, c'mon, c'mon.

01:07:33.596 --> 01:07:36.421
TRAVIS: (strained) That's pretty good. That's a
30, minus five is 25.

01:07:36.421 --> 01:07:37.981
MATT: 25
hits. Roll damage.

01:07:37.981 --> 01:07:39.180
(all cheer)

01:07:39.180 --> 01:07:40.111
MARISHA: Come on, come on.

01:07:40.111 --> 01:07:44.092
TRAVIS: Fuck you, Master Splinter.

01:07:44.159 --> 01:07:46.262
LIAM: Oh man, Vax is just--

01:07:46.262 --> 01:07:47.772
TRAVIS: Yeah, I haven't forgotten
it now--

01:07:47.772 --> 01:07:49.252
LIAM: -- perched on the wall, pulling feathers
out.

01:07:49.252 --> 01:07:52.529
TRAVIS: -- 23, 33, 37.

01:07:52.529 --> 01:07:53.024
LAURA:
Oh!

01:07:53.024 --> 01:07:54.536
MATT: Okay, how do you want to do this?

01:07:54.536 --> 01:08:02.066
(all cheer and clap)

01:08:02.066 --> 01:08:03.578
LIAM: That was Vox Machina's
real reaction.

01:08:03.578 --> 01:08:05.348
TRAVIS: Okay, so the first one hits, right?

01:08:05.348 --> 01:08:08.277
MATT: The first one hits, the second one, he
rolls out of the way and you pull back--

01:08:08.277 --> 01:08:14.676
TRAVIS: Right, I reach back for the third
one and I go, who's good now? (whack)

01:08:14.676 --> 01:08:20.025
MATT: (crack) You guys watch as he knocks 
him clean 15 feet in the air

01:08:20.025 --> 01:08:24.739
from the blast of the blow. He ends up 
landing on top and the outside--

01:08:24.739 --> 01:08:25.845
TRAVIS: Yes! (laughs)

01:08:25.845 --> 01:08:31.324
MATT: -- of the arena (boom) landing strewn across
the steps that lead to the edge of the sand pit,

01:08:31.324 --> 01:08:34.936
and there's just quiet in the chamber.

01:08:34.936 --> 01:08:36.649
TRAVIS: (heavy
breathing)

01:08:36.649 --> 01:08:38.764
MATT: As he stands there breathing heavily,
covered in blood.

01:08:38.764 --> 01:08:44.649
There's spatters of blood all across the sand and 
Groon's just lying there, unconscious, breathing.

01:08:44.649 --> 01:08:47.999
LAURA: We're just
screaming our asses off.

01:08:47.999 --> 01:08:48.868
MATT: You guys are yelling.

01:08:48.868 --> 01:08:49.771
MARISHA: Aaaah!

01:08:49.771 --> 01:08:53.049
TRAVIS: Wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait. Stay there.

01:08:53.049 --> 01:08:56.126
LAURA: What?

01:08:56.126 --> 01:08:58.907
MATT: At this point, there's the opening at
the top of the temple.

01:08:58.907 --> 01:08:59.797
TRAVIS: Right.

01:08:59.797 --> 01:09:13.571
MATT: There's... a rumbling sound, a
(rumble), from up above. And there's a small spark

01:09:13.571 --> 01:09:17.470
of energy that (cracks) up above, (cracks) streaks
down and hits Groon--

01:09:17.470 --> 01:09:18.676
LAURA and MARISHA: (gasp)

01:09:18.676 --> 01:09:24.652
MATT: -- like a very faint lightning bolt,
just (pfft) out of the sky and Groon rises up on

01:09:24.652 --> 01:09:34.166
the side, his eyes just vibrant bright, almost
glowing, and he stands back up, and he's still

01:09:34.166 --> 01:09:40.940
covered in his own blood, he's wrecked. You can
see parts of his body where the muscle is swollen,

01:09:40.940 --> 01:09:46.969
one arm appears to be almost ruined, but he lands
right in front of you.

01:09:46.969 --> 01:09:48.532
TRAVIS: Little bit of pee comes out.

01:09:48.532 --> 01:09:49.734
MARISHA: Uh-huh.

01:09:49.734 --> 01:09:52.564
LAURA: (laughs)
Everybody's peeing.

01:09:52.564 --> 01:09:55.343
LIAM: Join the party.

01:09:55.343 --> 01:10:01.528
MATT: "You've learned much... and Kord smiles
upon you."

01:10:01.528 --> 01:10:09.569
As you look up and you hear the roiling again,
and two bolts come streaming out of the top of

01:10:09.569 --> 01:10:15.730
the temple down towards Grog. And slamming into
your body, you instinctually pull down and hunker,

01:10:15.730 --> 01:10:20.514
as an animal in a thunderstorm would, but you
feel the warmth as your gauntlets all of a sudden

01:10:20.514 --> 01:10:26.854
flash with electrical energy. And you look down as
the runes on all the sides, and the chains are now

01:10:26.854 --> 01:10:30.506
glowing with divine energy.

01:10:30.506 --> 01:10:34.113
SAM: You're a magician!

01:10:34.113 --> 01:10:36.208
TRAVIS: Awesome!

01:10:36.208 --> 01:10:40.778
MATT: As the roiling kinda comes to a close you
hear the (thunder noises) of thunder begin to

01:10:40.778 --> 01:10:48.622
subside, and you feel the smell of burnt sky and
ozone around you begin to subside, still looking

01:10:48.622 --> 01:10:52.648
down at the energy pulsing through the gauntlets.
Groon is still standing there,

01:10:52.648 --> 01:10:56.458
looking up at you, and just goes:

01:10:56.458 --> 01:11:01.039
"Continue with your journey."

01:11:01.039 --> 01:11:04.165
And just looks at you, waiting for some kind of
response.

01:11:04.165 --> 01:11:13.991
TRAVIS: I walk over to him. I bow. And then I
reach out one of the Titanstone Knuckles.

01:11:13.991 --> 01:11:17.012
Kord's strength to you.

01:11:17.012 --> 01:11:22.024
MATT: And (slamming noise) slams and pulls you in,
and with an intensity you feel his fingers crack,

01:11:22.024 --> 01:11:28.595
even through these newly-imbued gauntlets you feel
the tension as his grip is still, strangely...

01:11:28.595 --> 01:11:33.438
You expect he could be powerful enough to crush
the gauntlet with his bare fingers. He just pulls

01:11:33.438 --> 01:11:38.515
you in from your giant form. The strength is
immense and you (grunt) kinda pull down into his

01:11:38.515 --> 01:11:42.557
form. He looks you straight up, face to face,
but an inch away.

01:11:42.557 --> 01:11:52.570
"What have you learned?"

01:11:52.570 --> 01:12:04.819
TRAVIS: That without the love of my friends,
life has no meaning, and I would be nothing.

01:12:04.819 --> 01:12:10.159
MATT: And how will you utilize this knowledge?

01:12:10.159 --> 01:12:18.567
TRAVIS: I will make their strength mine,
and my strength their own, and in turn,

01:12:18.567 --> 01:12:25.390
I will try to make the world a better place than
I found it.

01:12:25.390 --> 01:12:30.753
MATT: His grip pulls off, and he withdraws his
arm, and he releases you

01:12:30.753 --> 01:12:32.542
back to your full standing pose.

01:12:32.542 --> 01:12:39.024
Now, at your enlarged form, gargantuan in the
center of this temple space, his once very

01:12:39.024 --> 01:12:48.412
intimidating form, diminutive by comparison to
Grog's full structure, looks up and nods.

01:12:48.412 --> 01:12:51.736
"I thank you."

01:12:51.736 --> 01:12:53.674
GROG: I mean, I really-- I thank you.

01:12:53.674 --> 01:12:55.293
(all laugh)

01:12:55.358 --> 01:13:00.522
TRAVIS: I've never gone that far in a battle
before. I didn't even know that was possible.

01:13:00.522 --> 01:13:04.718
This was incredible. I'm talking a lot,
aren't I? I have a bit of a man crush--

01:13:04.718 --> 01:13:06.297
MATT: Yes. Yes you are.

01:13:06.297 --> 01:13:15.065
TRAVIS: Okay. Uh. Thank you.

01:13:15.128 --> 01:13:19.425
And I turn, and I walk back to my friends.

01:13:19.425 --> 01:13:24.844
MATT: As you make your way back, Groon steps and
leaps back out onto the opposite side, and you can

01:13:24.844 --> 01:13:33.303
see, on the opposite end of the platform,
of the sand pit, there is a silver, somewhat

01:13:33.303 --> 01:13:40.141
tarnished, but still functional, bell. And he
walks over to the side of it, grabs the rope,

01:13:40.141 --> 01:13:48.850
and just-- (tolling of a low bell). And you
watch, from all the different corners of the empty

01:13:48.850 --> 01:13:54.454
temple, all the priests of Kord begin to wander
back in, who had exited previously, as was the

01:13:54.454 --> 01:13:57.566
request, it seems, of Earthbreaker Groon,
knowing that you were coming.

01:13:57.566 --> 01:13:59.499
LAURA: (whispers) Oh my gosh.

01:13:59.499 --> 01:14:04.260
MATT: They all just silently enter and kind of nod
and bow in your direction as you make your way

01:14:04.260 --> 01:14:07.584
towards your friends. You acknowledge it,
but it doesn't slow you, doesn't stop you,

01:14:07.584 --> 01:14:09.808
they are still your focus. And you guys watch as

01:14:09.808 --> 01:14:13.470
Grog approaches, bloodied, beaten, barely 
conscious,

01:14:13.470 --> 01:14:18.189
one eye, the lid is kinda drooping a bit.
And even though he's strong in his stride,

01:14:18.189 --> 01:14:22.912
there's still a shake with his knees, but he
doesn't show that weakness. He keeps pushing

01:14:22.912 --> 01:14:26.053
towards you with a slight smile through his
bearded face.

01:14:26.053 --> 01:14:33.461
TRAVIS: Guys-- (cough) if we could just make our
way out of here, in as cool a way as possible...

01:14:33.461 --> 01:14:37.763
If I fall, just pick me up like Weekend at
Bernie's, okay?

01:14:37.763 --> 01:14:39.301
(all laugh)

01:14:39.301 --> 01:14:43.669
LAURA: Pike stands next to him and says,
Don't worry, you won't fall. And she casts, um,

01:14:43.669 --> 01:14:45.410
Cure-- whatever, fucking--

01:14:45.410 --> 01:14:47.118
(all laugh)

01:14:47.118 --> 01:14:48.571
LAURA: I don't fucking know what the spell is.

01:14:48.571 --> 01:14:49.791
MATT: Cure, Cure Things!

01:14:49.791 --> 01:14:50.801
LAURA: I'm not even looking at them-- Cure--

01:14:50.801 --> 01:14:51.766
MATT: You have the spell!

01:14:51.766 --> 01:14:53.008
LAURA: He-- no, no, no, I gave them back to
Ashley!

01:14:53.008 --> 01:14:53.853
MATT: No, I mean--

01:14:53.853 --> 01:14:54.573
TRAVIS: Vex.

01:14:54.573 --> 01:14:55.878
MATT: Vex has the spell.

01:14:55.878 --> 01:14:57.964
LAURA: Yeah, but as Pike, Cure-- okay, but Pike,
she can do it better than Vex can.

01:14:57.964 --> 01:14:59.511
TRAVIS: You have the spell!

01:14:59.511 --> 01:15:05.586
MATT: Sure, I rolled it for you. You heal eight
hit points.

01:15:05.586 --> 01:15:08.335
LAURA: That way you're standing and you don't have
to wobble out.

01:15:08.335 --> 01:15:09.759
TRAVIS: I'm back at nine.

01:15:09.759 --> 01:15:12.172
LIAM: Let's get you some ale, big man.

01:15:12.172 --> 01:15:15.437
TRAVIS: That sounds great.

01:15:15.437 --> 01:15:16.227
LAURA: Grog.

01:15:16.227 --> 01:15:17.183
TRAVIS: Yeah?

01:15:17.183 --> 01:15:18.598
LAURA: That was fucking amazing.

01:15:18.598 --> 01:15:20.279
TRAVIS: Right? I mean, I got struck by lightning,
guys.

01:15:20.279 --> 01:15:22.667
LAURA: Wait! Look at your gauntlets!

01:15:22.667 --> 01:15:23.204
TRAVIS: What?

01:15:23.204 --> 01:15:25.278
LAURA: They're glowing!

01:15:25.278 --> 01:15:26.625
TRAVIS: Oh shit, they are.

01:15:26.625 --> 01:15:27.827
LAURA: What does it mean?

01:15:27.827 --> 01:15:29.821
MARISHA: Is that lightning available to you all
the time?

01:15:29.821 --> 01:15:34.866
(all yell)

01:15:34.866 --> 01:15:36.389
SAM: Piece of paper.

01:15:36.389 --> 01:15:39.794
LIAM: Just for clarification, that all took place
in Super Nintendo graphics, right?

01:15:39.794 --> 01:15:41.006
MATT: Oh, yeah.

01:15:41.006 --> 01:15:42.081
LIAM: 16-bit.

01:15:42.081 --> 01:15:46.625
MARISHA: As we walk out, Keyleth throws a little
gust cantrip to kick up the dust behind us.

01:15:46.625 --> 01:15:51.059
It just looks really dusty and epic as we walk
off into the sunset.

01:15:51.059 --> 01:15:54.904
MATT: As you guys walk off, the silhouetted
most-of-Vox-Machina with one giant Grog form

01:15:54.904 --> 01:16:01.157
stepping through. You exit the Trial Forge into
the rest of Vasselheim. We'll take a break there.

01:16:01.157 --> 01:16:02.200
TRAVIS: Wow.

01:16:02.200 --> 01:16:03.933
LAURA: What's it do, what's it do?

01:16:03.933 --> 01:16:06.258
MATT: Yeah, what does it do?

01:16:06.258 --> 01:16:13.917
TRAVIS: In its Exalted form, my strength now
becomes 26, so plus eight, right?

01:16:13.917 --> 01:16:15.046
MATT: Yeah.

01:16:15.046 --> 01:16:19.726
TRAVIS: And when I use Enlarge now, I gain
resistance to

01:16:19.726 --> 01:16:24.255
fire, cold, lightning, for ten minutes.

01:16:24.255 --> 01:16:27.117
LAURA: Oh shit, imagine if we had done that before
we went after the dragons.

01:16:27.117 --> 01:16:29.406
LIAM: You should've fought that guy before the
dragons.

01:16:29.406 --> 01:16:30.536
TRAVIS: Hey, you know?

01:16:30.536 --> 01:16:32.496
(all laugh)

01:16:32.496 --> 01:16:35.121
TRAVIS: A little drama's good for everybody.

01:16:35.121 --> 01:16:37.577
LIAM: You barely eked out that victory, by the
way.

01:16:37.577 --> 01:16:39.051
TRAVIS: I know, and double damage.

01:16:39.051 --> 01:16:40.123
MARISHA: Wait, fire, lightning, and what?

01:16:40.123 --> 01:16:41.107
TRAVIS: And cold.

01:16:41.107 --> 01:16:44.414
MARISHA: Lightning, fire, and cold, and double
damage?

01:16:44.414 --> 01:16:45.476
TRAVIS: Yeah, so --

01:16:45.476 --> 01:16:46.835
MATT: Well, not double damage.

01:16:46.835 --> 01:16:48.225
TRAVIS: Double damage on objects and structures.

01:16:48.225 --> 01:16:50.627
MATT: He had that previously.

01:16:50.627 --> 01:16:57.539
TRAVIS: But that's a lot of resistance to a lot of
things. And 26 is... that's really strong.

01:16:57.539 --> 01:17:01.217
MATT: 26 is good. It's two more than what you had,
so everything goes up plus one damage to hit.

01:17:01.217 --> 01:17:03.232
LAURA: Damn.

01:17:03.232 --> 01:17:06.852
LIAM: My armor does that too, but it only makes me
smell bad, it doesn't affect me.

01:17:06.852 --> 01:17:09.528
TRAVIS: That was awesome.

01:17:09.528 --> 01:17:13.324
MATT: All right, guys. We're gonna take a quick
break, hit the restroom, get some snacks,

01:17:13.324 --> 01:17:20.146
and we'll be back here in a few minutes.
Thank you again. See you in a second.

01:17:20.146 --> 01:38:09.756
[break]

01:38:09.825 --> 01:38:12.895
MATT: Hello everyone, and welcome back to Critical
Role.

01:38:12.895 --> 01:38:14.328
(all laugh)

01:38:14.380 --> 01:38:19.043
MATT: So, picking up where we left off, Vox
Machina is now exiting the Trial Forge into the

01:38:19.043 --> 01:38:26.736
Braving Grounds, Grog with the recently reinforced
Titanstone Gauntlets by the strength of Kord

01:38:26.736 --> 01:38:31.134
through your duel with Earthbreaker Groon.

01:38:31.134 --> 01:38:32.089
TRAVIS: Yeah!

01:38:32.089 --> 01:38:32.756
LAURA: Sick!

01:38:32.756 --> 01:38:35.343
MARISHA: What do they do Grog? What do they do?

01:38:35.343 --> 01:38:39.617
TRAVIS: I dunno. You know what, we'll probably
have to fight somebody to find out, let's find

01:38:39.617 --> 01:38:41.768
the first person outside of here.

01:38:41.840 --> 01:38:43.365
MARISHA: Well, I mean, okay

01:38:43.365 --> 01:38:44.725
SAM: Sure to one-hit them.

01:38:44.725 --> 01:38:46.387
LAURA: Maybe we can find an old building and you
can just destroy it.

01:38:46.387 --> 01:38:47.589
TRAVIS: I'm at nine.

01:38:47.589 --> 01:38:48.688
TALIESIN: It's just a kitten going-- (mimes
punching a kitten)

01:38:48.688 --> 01:38:49.670
LIAM: Old woman!

01:38:49.670 --> 01:38:50.578
MATT: Red mist.

01:38:50.578 --> 01:38:52.085
(all laugh)

01:38:52.085 --> 01:38:53.599
TRAVIS: (exploding noises) Oh shit.

01:38:53.599 --> 01:38:55.428
MARISHA: And that's how Grog was beaten to death
by a purse.

01:38:55.428 --> 01:38:57.841
TALIESIN: It is technically one point. He may go
down.

01:38:57.841 --> 01:38:59.669
MARISHA: Yeah, an old lady trying to cross the
street and takes out Grog.

01:38:59.669 --> 01:39:01.343
TRAVIS: I'm at nine hit points.

01:39:01.343 --> 01:39:03.073
TALIESIN: Nine hit points?

01:39:03.073 --> 01:39:06.438
LIAM: He did just take down an old man so our
streak against the elderly is going strong.

01:39:06.438 --> 01:39:08.073
(all laugh)

01:39:08.073 --> 01:39:09.855
MARISHA: You have the hit points of a kitten right
now.

01:39:09.855 --> 01:39:13.141
TRAVIS: Right, well, I do-- I am fond of cats.

01:39:13.141 --> 01:39:18.213
MATT: I'm pretty sure a kitten has less hit points
than that.

01:39:18.213 --> 01:39:19.207
MARISHA: Yeah, like five.

01:39:19.207 --> 01:39:20.234
TALIESIN: Five.

01:39:20.234 --> 01:39:23.362
MATT: Who would've had a level one character with
less hit points then a kitten. That would be the

01:39:23.362 --> 01:39:24.550
saddest thing ever.

01:39:24.550 --> 01:39:26.487
(all laugh)

01:39:26.487 --> 01:39:29.475
TALIESIN: We worked it out at one point.
We worked out the math at one point.

01:39:29.527 --> 01:39:30.135
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:39:30.135 --> 01:39:33.584
LIAM: Five is way too many. At level one you can
have five hit points as a person.

01:39:33.584 --> 01:39:35.318
TALIESIN: It's like two hit points, it's going to
be a very tough kitten.

01:39:35.318 --> 01:39:36.580
LIAM: It'd be like 0.1.

01:39:36.580 --> 01:39:37.512
MARISHA: I mean if you're a wizard.

01:39:37.581 --> 01:39:42.037
MATT: What we're saying is 'kitten' is the
baseline hit point counter in Dungeons and

01:39:42.037 --> 01:39:44.331
Dragons, everybody.

01:39:44.331 --> 01:39:47.953
SAM: Can we count hit points in kitten strength
for now?

01:39:47.953 --> 01:39:50.565
MATT: All right, I'm going to use three hit dice,
I'm at 12 kittens.

01:39:50.565 --> 01:39:55.648
LIAM: Jewels, gems, golds and kittens.

01:39:55.797 --> 01:39:58.837
And that's what the air machines run on.

01:39:59.021 --> 01:40:03.133
TRAVIS: Man. Thanks for not jumping in on that.
It was very personal.

01:40:03.133 --> 01:40:04.543
LAURA: It was really hard to not.

01:40:04.543 --> 01:40:05.634
TALIESIN: Anytime. You're welcome.

01:40:05.634 --> 01:40:06.530
TRAVIS: Yeah, thank you.

01:40:06.530 --> 01:40:08.333
LAURA: For a second there, Grog. For a second.
Well, a couple of seconds.

01:40:08.333 --> 01:40:11.297
Well, no, I did, did you not see?

01:40:11.297 --> 01:40:12.545
TRAVIS: I missed it.

01:40:12.545 --> 01:40:14.432
LAURA: Your back was turned for so much of the
time.

01:40:14.432 --> 01:40:15.505
TALIESIN: It was amazing.

01:40:15.505 --> 01:40:17.301
TRAVIS: Encore!

01:40:17.301 --> 01:40:22.189
LAURA: Well, I mean, we're outside. All right.

01:40:22.189 --> 01:40:23.143
TRAVIS: Don't.

01:40:23.143 --> 01:40:25.269
(all laugh)

01:40:25.269 --> 01:40:27.641
TRAVIS: I'm so sad Scanlan wasn't here for this.

01:40:27.641 --> 01:40:29.207
LAURA: I know, he would've loved that.

01:40:29.207 --> 01:40:31.278
TRAVIS: Yeah seriously. (sniffs)

01:40:31.278 --> 01:40:34.740
LAURA: I feel like we should go celebrate and
drink, but it wouldn't feel right without him.

01:40:34.740 --> 01:40:42.175
TRAVIS: No, I need like a million potions,
and maybe some attractive naked women to heal me

01:40:42.175 --> 01:40:44.451
back to my full health.

01:40:44.451 --> 01:40:45.375
LAURA: Right.

01:40:45.375 --> 01:40:47.050
MARISHA: It has been a while for you, hasn't it,
Grog?

01:40:47.050 --> 01:40:48.158
TALIESIN: Potions or women?

01:40:48.158 --> 01:40:51.353
TRAVIS: Yeah. Yeah. I'm real cranky so I need
bandages,

01:40:51.353 --> 01:40:54.892
and maybe some bondage, and just all the women.

01:40:54.892 --> 01:40:55.956
LIAM: Bandages upon bondages.

01:40:55.956 --> 01:40:57.306
MARISHA: Those things go together!

01:40:57.306 --> 01:40:58.113
TRAVIS: Good!

01:40:58.113 --> 01:40:58.986
MARISHA: That's great.

01:40:58.986 --> 01:41:00.010
TRAVIS: Like a B &amp;amp; B right?

01:41:00.010 --> 01:41:02.804
MARISHA: Yeah.. that's exactly what B &amp;amp; B means.

01:41:02.804 --> 01:41:05.817
TRAVIS: That's what the letters for those words
are.

01:41:05.817 --> 01:41:07.188
(all laugh)

01:41:07.188 --> 01:41:09.227
LIAM: How long has Scanlan been out for?

01:41:09.227 --> 01:41:19.656
MATT: Uh, at this point in time Scanlan's been out
for almost a day.

01:41:19.656 --> 01:41:21.407
SAM: (making dying noises in the background)

01:41:21.407 --> 01:41:23.378
LIAM: Gosh. I'd like to go get him, but I really
want him to wake up on his own accord.

01:41:23.378 --> 01:41:25.138
MARISHA: I mean, we can try head back to
Whitestone and get Grog

01:41:25.138 --> 01:41:28.771
healed up and check up on Scanlan.

01:41:28.771 --> 01:41:32.410
LAURA: I think that would be good. Maybe get some
potions before we head out here, because

01:41:32.410 --> 01:41:36.157
everyone's low. I'll just stop by the store and
pick some health potions

01:41:36.157 --> 01:41:37.693
from where we got them before.

01:41:37.693 --> 01:41:39.908
TRAVIS: There are nice stores here, and we haven't
even proper shopped in a while.

01:41:39.908 --> 01:41:42.278
MARISHA: It's true. Vasselheim hasn't been
touched, right?

01:41:42.278 --> 01:41:43.489
LIAM: Yeah. That's good thinking.

01:41:43.489 --> 01:41:45.406
MATT: From what you know of the Conclave, no.

01:41:45.406 --> 01:41:46.829
LAURA: I mean we've got fucking shit to sell--

01:41:46.829 --> 01:41:47.624
MARISHA: (sneezes)

01:41:47.624 --> 01:41:48.444
TALIESIN: Bless you.

01:41:48.444 --> 01:41:48.962
MARISHA: Sorry.

01:41:48.962 --> 01:41:52.252
LAURA: -- and stuff to buy, but that's kind of a
thing.

01:41:52.252 --> 01:41:56.654
TRAVIS: &nbsp;Or we should check out the stuff that we
got out of the den where Raishan was.

01:41:56.654 --> 01:41:58.414
MARISHA: We should definitely do the research.

01:41:58.414 --> 01:42:00.181
LAURA: That creepy-ass book we need to look at.

01:42:00.181 --> 01:42:04.226
LIAM: Is Scanlan sleeping it off? I mean,
we're in Vasselheim, we've just bamfed across

01:42:04.226 --> 01:42:06.537
miles and miles. We're here.

01:42:06.537 --> 01:42:07.401
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:42:07.401 --> 01:42:09.088
(all laugh)

01:42:09.088 --> 01:42:10.918
MARISHA: I know!

01:42:10.918 --> 01:42:13.194
SAM: Hmm, yeah, it's fine.

01:42:13.194 --> 01:42:15.027
LAURA: No, yeah, it's fine, it's fine, I'm just
fucking sitting here, no big deal.

01:42:15.027 --> 01:42:17.011
SAM: No, it's fine, I'm having a great dream.

01:42:17.011 --> 01:42:20.729
TALIESIN: I wonder what Scanlan would say if he
were here right now?

01:42:20.729 --> 01:42:22.779
SAM: Fucking come back and get me!

01:42:22.779 --> 01:42:27.922
(all laugh)

01:42:28.118 --> 01:42:31.258
TALIESIN: Yes, yes.

01:42:31.258 --> 01:42:32.195
MARISHA: He's asleep.

01:42:32.195 --> 01:42:33.108
TALIESIN: Very asleep.

01:42:33.108 --> 01:42:36.140
SAM: (snores)

01:42:36.140 --> 01:42:37.105
MARISHA: In a coma.

01:42:37.105 --> 01:42:38.579
LAURA: Shit.

01:42:38.579 --> 01:42:40.868
TALIESIN: Do quick shopping and then head home and
look at all the things.

01:42:40.868 --> 01:42:43.878
LAURA: A quick buying of potions, I just wanna see
if I can get some stuff.

01:42:43.878 --> 01:42:48.118
MATT: Make an investigation check.

01:42:48.118 --> 01:42:49.663
LAURA: I should've just shaken that instead of
just--

01:42:49.663 --> 01:42:50.775
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:42:50.775 --> 01:42:53.075
LAURA: Yeah. 14.

01:42:53.075 --> 01:43:01.899
MATT: Okay, with a cursory glance of the area of
the Quad Roads which you previously went to for

01:43:01.899 --> 01:43:12.761
the acquiring of various tonics and salves and
healing liquids, you do find a new nice

01:43:12.761 --> 01:43:18.508
establishment that's just recently been built.
And as you enter to check in, the gentleman at

01:43:18.508 --> 01:43:20.991
the front looks up at you, and is familiar
looking, and he goes

01:43:20.991 --> 01:43:25.971
"Can I help you-- No! You are not welcome. Leave.
Now. Out. Please." (snaps fingers)

01:43:25.971 --> 01:43:27.282
SAM: Who's this guy?

01:43:27.282 --> 01:43:28.454
MATT: And these two bouncers kind of step--

01:43:28.454 --> 01:43:30.170
LAURA: Are you the cart guy? Fucking who--

01:43:30.170 --> 01:43:32.430
MATT: Please. No. Not her. Please!

01:43:32.430 --> 01:43:36.823
LAURA: I didn't abuse him. Everyone else abused
him. I was very kind to you.

01:43:36.823 --> 01:43:39.543
MATT: Your business is not welcome here, goodbye.

01:43:39.543 --> 01:43:47.808
TRAVIS: Excuse me, has anyone seen my friend Ve--
You.

01:43:47.808 --> 01:43:49.017
MATT: You?

01:43:49.017 --> 01:43:54.592
TRAVIS: -- beautiful salesman, carrier of all
delightful things.

01:43:54.592 --> 01:43:56.852
LAURA: See! We're friends, we're all friends
here.

01:43:56.940 --> 01:43:58.912
TRAVIS: Was he uncomfortable seeing you or
something?

01:43:58.912 --> 01:44:00.332
LAURA: Yeah. Said he didn't like me very much.

01:44:00.332 --> 01:44:03.367
TRAVIS AND LAURA: I can't imagine why?

01:44:03.367 --> 01:44:05.455
MATT: What do you want from me?

01:44:05.455 --> 01:44:07.040
LAURA: Just some potions.

01:44:07.040 --> 01:44:09.038
MATT: We don't have many.

01:44:09.038 --> 01:44:11.543
TRAVIS: Whatcha got?

01:44:11.543 --> 01:44:13.409
MATT: We can do business. We cannot.

01:44:13.409 --> 01:44:16.056
LAURA: All right, I'll just stand next to him
while you do business with him.

01:44:16.056 --> 01:44:17.830
MATT: You're not welcome in my establishment.

01:44:17.830 --> 01:44:19.990
TRAVIS: I'm really hard of hearing. Like,
I've been working--

01:44:19.990 --> 01:44:22.130
MATT: I can yell!

01:44:22.130 --> 01:44:23.663
LAURA: Could you understand that?

01:44:23.663 --> 01:44:24.946
TRAVIS: It was like (mimics Matt)

01:44:24.946 --> 01:44:26.012
MATT: (groans)

01:44:26.012 --> 01:44:29.440
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, it's just muffled, it's just
muffled for him.

01:44:29.440 --> 01:44:35.270
MATT: (huffs) "Well, our stocks have been running
low since last time you came through,

01:44:35.319 --> 01:44:39.535
we don't have much!" He puts up a small leather 
case and opens it.

01:44:39.535 --> 01:44:43.583
TRAVIS: It is such a shame. Did you tell him
already that we have a whole kingdom's worth of

01:44:43.583 --> 01:44:46.196
jewelry and gold to spend, and I'm really tired
of carrying it.

01:44:46.216 --> 01:44:47.153
LAURA: Stuff to sell.

01:44:47.153 --> 01:44:48.454
MATT: Blah, blah, blah, blah.

01:44:48.454 --> 01:44:52.153
LAURA: It is so unfortunate. We are saviors of
Emon,

01:44:52.153 --> 01:44:55.233
saviors of the world, really, and he doesn't
even care.

01:44:55.233 --> 01:44:58.104
TRAVIS: I thought I'd lighten this backpack a
little.

01:44:58.104 --> 01:45:02.669
MATT: I really don't care. I have four healing
potions and one greater. That is all I have.

01:45:02.669 --> 01:45:03.848
LAURA: Oh, is it?

01:45:03.848 --> 01:45:07.206
MATT: That's it. You want it? No? Then good day.

01:45:07.206 --> 01:45:10.345
LAURA: You know, I don't like him, I don't even
want to buy it from him.

01:45:10.345 --> 01:45:13.360
MATT: Perfect.

01:45:13.360 --> 01:45:15.136
TRAVIS: You go ahead and leave.

01:45:15.136 --> 01:45:15.867
MATT: Please!

01:45:15.867 --> 01:45:18.174
LAURA: No, Grog, please don't. Don't shop without
me.

01:45:18.174 --> 01:45:20.861
TRAVIS: I'm just gonna yell at him really loud.

01:45:21.019 --> 01:45:24.600
LAURA: No, no, I'm standing here. I can't let you
do this.

01:45:24.600 --> 01:45:26.970
MATT: Could you please just escort them out--

01:45:26.970 --> 01:45:30.851
TRAVIS: No, no, no, we'll take it. We'll take it.
How much?

01:45:30.851 --> 01:45:35.485
For the four healing potions and the
one greater?

01:45:35.485 --> 01:45:38.947
MATT: 1500 gold pieces.

01:45:38.947 --> 01:45:39.781
TRAVIS: Cool!

01:45:39.781 --> 01:45:45.105
LAURA: I don't know, me personally, if that is a
good amount. But Vex would know, is that a good

01:45:45.105 --> 01:45:49.540
amount or is that a shit amount?

01:45:49.540 --> 01:45:53.173
MATT: Based on your previous dealings with this
individual,

01:45:53.173 --> 01:45:55.976
the fact that you are getting a price
at all--

01:45:55.976 --> 01:45:57.749
LAURA: Yeah.

01:45:57.749 --> 01:45:59.248
MATT: --is good.

01:45:59.248 --> 01:46:00.624
LAURA: But it's not a good price.

01:46:00.624 --> 01:46:04.992
MATT: It's not a good market price, but it's also
a buyer's market right now.

01:46:04.992 --> 01:46:07.524
TRAVIS: I know how to do this. I take a bag of
gold--

01:46:07.524 --> 01:46:08.791
LAURA: No, Grog! Grog, Grog, Grog.

01:46:08.791 --> 01:46:11.134
TRAVIS: -- pour it onto the desk. Just a pile of
gold.

01:46:11.134 --> 01:46:19.941
LAURA: Grog, do not do this. Please, please,
please.

01:46:19.941 --> 01:46:21.394
TRAVIS: 1500 gold pieces.

01:46:21.394 --> 01:46:26.539
LAURA: I just scoop it back into your little--
hold out your pouch.

01:46:26.539 --> 01:46:28.882
TRAVIS: Do you not want healing potions, or what?

01:46:28.882 --> 01:46:29.640
LAURA: Huh?

01:46:29.640 --> 01:46:31.102
MATT: He starts putting them back into the leather
case. (huffs)

01:46:31.102 --> 01:46:35.933
LAURA: I don't want his healing potions.
I think those aren't even real healing

01:46:35.999 --> 01:46:37.906
potions, I think those are probably water
colored--

01:46:37.906 --> 01:46:39.860
TRAVIS: Well, I mean, clearly I have to say they
have worked.

01:46:39.860 --> 01:46:45.533
MATT: Probably yes, you're right. They are colored
liquid of no particular worth. You're right,

01:46:45.533 --> 01:46:46.549
leave. Begone.

01:46:46.549 --> 01:46:47.411
LAURA: Right.

01:46:47.411 --> 01:46:49.184
TRAVIS: They've worked every time.

01:46:49.184 --> 01:46:51.450
LAURA: But we can-- Grog, please.

01:46:51.450 --> 01:46:56.840
TRAVIS: Vex. We are so rich.

01:46:56.840 --> 01:47:00.966
LIAM: I lean in the door and say, you've been in
there long enough to pay rent, what is going on?

01:47:00.966 --> 01:47:03.209
TRAVIS: Vax, will you come in here a minute?

01:47:03.209 --> 01:47:04.363
LIAM: Uh, yeah.

01:47:04.363 --> 01:47:12.087
TRAVIS: Will you please tell your sister that we
have enough money to fund several townships,

01:47:12.087 --> 01:47:16.631
and that this guy wants 1500 gold for four
healing potions and we have almost none.

01:47:16.631 --> 01:47:18.764
LAURA: And a greater healing potion! Five healing
potions really.

01:47:18.764 --> 01:47:20.217
LIAM: Is she being a pain in the arse?

01:47:20.217 --> 01:47:21.580
TRAVIS: Yeah, I mean, c'mon, Vax.

01:47:21.580 --> 01:47:23.122
LIAM: We're not begging in Stillben. Will you give
the guy some fucking coin

01:47:23.122 --> 01:47:24.542
so we can get the fuck out of here?

01:47:24.542 --> 01:47:27.541
LAURA: Yeah, but this guy's mean!

01:47:27.541 --> 01:47:31.074
LIAM: My time is valuable. Will you pay him so we
can go, please?

01:47:31.074 --> 01:47:34.174
TRAVIS: You're also royalty, so you should show
peasants how to act.

01:47:34.174 --> 01:47:36.312
You know, stiff upper lip, pip-pip.

01:47:36.312 --> 01:47:38.261
TALIESIN: So glad I'm not in this room.

01:47:38.261 --> 01:47:39.463
LAURA: That's true.

01:47:39.463 --> 01:47:40.964
MARISHA: My time is valuable.

01:47:40.964 --> 01:47:41.867
LIAM: That was Liam.

01:47:41.867 --> 01:47:42.751
MARISHA: I know, I know.

01:47:42.751 --> 01:47:51.620
LAURA: I am a lady, and ladies treat merchants
well, and they don't hold grudges, I hear,

01:47:51.620 --> 01:47:57.697
because they are ladies and they are above it.
So here. Take this 1500 gold. I'm going to count

01:47:57.697 --> 01:48:03.506
it out for you, Grog. It's below him, it's beneath
him to count this gold, he's also a Lord.

01:48:03.506 --> 01:48:06.093
There you are. C'mon Grand Poobah.

01:48:06.093 --> 01:48:09.326
LIAM: All he hears is fart noises, and I grab her
by the mouth and I drag her out the door.

01:48:09.326 --> 01:48:10.970
LAURA: Oh my god.

01:48:10.970 --> 01:48:16.772
MATT: He hands the potions over to Grog.
"Very well. Enjoy your day, and I'd be wary of

01:48:16.772 --> 01:48:21.800
keeping her as your business contact. She's a bit
abrasive."

01:48:21.800 --> 01:48:25.486
TRAVIS: Yeah, I noticed. You've moved up in the
world, this is really nice.

01:48:25.486 --> 01:48:29.886
MATT: I'm sharing it with a few folks, it's sort
of a partnership, but yes.

01:48:29.886 --> 01:48:31.328
TRAVIS: Is it working out for you?

01:48:31.405 --> 01:48:35.772
MATT: Well, I've had to hire bodyguards,
if that's any indication.

01:48:35.772 --> 01:48:42.114
TRAVIS: If I wanted your name, like if I wanted to
call on you later, 'cause it seems like-- As far

01:48:42.114 --> 01:48:44.956
back as I can remember, we've run into you quite a
bit, and I'm kind of fond of this--

01:48:44.956 --> 01:48:47.067
LAURA: No, just a couple of times. Just a couple
of times.

01:48:47.067 --> 01:48:48.794
TRAVIS: Yeah. Do you have a name?

01:48:48.794 --> 01:48:50.711
MATT: Cidrick Gillsman.

01:48:50.711 --> 01:48:52.189
TRAVIS: I will not remember that.

01:48:52.189 --> 01:48:54.400
MARISHA: Oh, this guy.

01:48:54.400 --> 01:48:56.739
TRAVIS: By the way, did you have any--

01:48:56.739 --> 01:48:59.112
LAURA: It's the guy. That took advantage of Grog

01:48:59.112 --> 01:49:00.270
MARISHA: That took all the money from him?

01:49:00.270 --> 01:49:02.250
LIAM: It's why I'm saying nothing.

01:49:02.250 --> 01:49:04.835
TRAVIS: --limited exclusive items and, like,
top shelf. Your most elite, (clicks tongue)

01:49:04.835 --> 01:49:06.491
paying customers only?

01:49:06.491 --> 01:49:09.616
MARISHA: Did you say 'a leek'?

01:49:09.616 --> 01:49:13.620
MATT: I just generally run the realm of healing
balms and salves.

01:49:13.684 --> 01:49:14.695
TRAVIS: Right.

01:49:14.695 --> 01:49:19.122
MATT: My partner does a bit more than that,
but he is out currently picking up a shipment and

01:49:19.122 --> 01:49:21.914
will be back in a few days. Try back then.

01:49:21.914 --> 01:49:23.627
MARISHA: Where's his shipment from?

01:49:23.627 --> 01:49:24.455
SAM: Are you there?

01:49:24.455 --> 01:49:25.639
MATT: Who are you?

01:49:25.639 --> 01:49:27.129
MARISHA: Did he come out? I thought he came out.

01:49:27.129 --> 01:49:28.081
ALL: No.

01:49:28.081 --> 01:49:29.406
LIAM: No, he walked into the door with Vex.

01:49:29.406 --> 01:49:30.161
MARISHA: No, sorry.

01:49:30.161 --> 01:49:31.899
SAM: You're at the window. When's he coming back?

01:49:31.899 --> 01:49:34.526
TRAVIS: Where's he getting his shipment from? Do
you trust your partner? This new guy?

01:49:34.526 --> 01:49:38.911
MATT: I do, and I don't trust you enough to tell
you this information.

01:49:38.911 --> 01:49:40.944
TRAVIS: I give him ten gold for the information.

01:49:40.944 --> 01:49:44.440
MATT: Thank you, that is very generous. I don't
know.

01:49:44.440 --> 01:49:45.564
TRAVIS: Oh.

01:49:45.564 --> 01:49:47.028
MATT: He gives the ten gold back.

01:49:47.028 --> 01:49:56.516
TRAVIS: Oh! I thank you for your time, Poobah out.
And I leave.

01:49:56.580 --> 01:49:59.418
(all laugh)

01:49:59.418 --> 01:50:02.915
MATT: All right.

01:50:02.915 --> 01:50:05.554
TRAVIS: Look, I know that was hard for you.

01:50:05.554 --> 01:50:06.359
LAURA: Grog.

01:50:06.359 --> 01:50:07.562
TRAVIS: He was very apologetic.

01:50:07.562 --> 01:50:08.411
LAURA: Was he?

01:50:08.411 --> 01:50:09.800
TRAVIS: Yup. He was-- yup.

01:50:09.800 --> 01:50:12.005
LAURA: Grog, he took advantage of you before--

01:50:12.005 --> 01:50:12.872
TRAVIS: No, he didn't.

01:50:12.872 --> 01:50:13.921
LAURA: -- and I didn't like that.

01:50:13.921 --> 01:50:16.096
TRAVIS: No, look, his hands were on that side of
the counter the whole time.

01:50:16.096 --> 01:50:16.867
LAURA: Oh?

01:50:16.867 --> 01:50:17.502
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:50:17.502 --> 01:50:18.157
LAURA: Really?

01:50:18.157 --> 01:50:19.069
TRAVIS: Mm-hm.

01:50:19.069 --> 01:50:19.955
LAURA: Well, all right then.

01:50:19.955 --> 01:50:21.818
TRAVIS: Yeah, here, these are for you.

01:50:21.818 --> 01:50:22.766
LAURA: Thanks, darling.

01:50:22.766 --> 01:50:23.279
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:50:23.279 --> 01:50:24.170
LAURA: Which one do you want?

01:50:24.170 --> 01:50:28.717
TRAVIS: No, I don't want any, I need more of the
hands-on healing, you know what I'm saying?

01:50:28.717 --> 01:50:33.070
LAURA: I cast Cure Wounds on him. Level four,
bitch!

01:50:33.070 --> 01:50:33.815
MATT: All right.

01:50:33.815 --> 01:50:34.730
LAURA: Whoa.

01:50:34.790 --> 01:50:36.039
MATT: 4d8

01:50:36.039 --> 01:50:36.795
(all laugh)

01:50:36.795 --> 01:50:37.900
TRAVIS: 4d8?

01:50:37.900 --> 01:50:38.897
MATT: 4d8 plus your wisdom modifier.

01:50:38.897 --> 01:50:40.027
LIAM: What does that mean?

01:50:40.027 --> 01:50:41.684
TALIESIN: It's like if you gave him an ice cream,
you see me running around on a sugar high for the

01:50:41.684 --> 01:50:43.938
rest of the day. Never gonna burn that off.

01:50:43.938 --> 01:50:44.644
LAURA: 14, 19.

01:50:44.644 --> 01:50:47.035
MARISHA: Yeah, the Makey Mace-- the Mickey
Mouse-shaped one?

01:50:47.035 --> 01:50:47.747
TALIESIN: Forgot the ears.

01:50:47.747 --> 01:50:48.782
MARISHA: Those were great, with the ears.

01:50:48.782 --> 01:50:49.542
LAURA: 22.

01:50:49.542 --> 01:50:50.332
TRAVIS: 22

01:50:50.332 --> 01:50:52.595
TRAVIS: 31 hit points.

01:50:52.668 --> 01:50:55.036
LAURA: So... who needs the greater?

01:50:55.036 --> 01:50:56.428
MARISHA: I'm all right. Give it to others.

01:50:56.428 --> 01:50:59.833
TRAVIS: I mean, we could take a short rest and let
me heal up for a second. Once we land somewhere.

01:50:59.833 --> 01:51:01.015
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:51:01.015 --> 01:51:02.154
MARISHA: We're going home, right?

01:51:02.154 --> 01:51:03.640
LIAM: You wanna rest in the tavern?

01:51:03.640 --> 01:51:04.379
TRAVIS: I mean, maybe.

01:51:04.379 --> 01:51:05.375
LIAM: For an hour?

01:51:05.375 --> 01:51:06.845
TRAVIS: But didn't you need to go somewhere?

01:51:06.845 --> 01:51:07.715
LAURA: Percy. Greater?

01:51:07.715 --> 01:51:08.980
TALIESIN: Thank you.

01:51:08.980 --> 01:51:10.650
LAURA: Then I pass out the other healing potions
between--

01:51:10.650 --> 01:51:12.585
LIAM: Where I have to go is a little more
involved.

01:51:12.585 --> 01:51:13.249
TRAVIS: Oh.

01:51:13.249 --> 01:51:14.777
LIAM: Yeah.

01:51:14.777 --> 01:51:19.495
MARISHA: Are you gonna slide by the temple?

01:51:19.495 --> 01:51:24.621
LIAM: I scoop you by the arm and take you off for
a minute. You know, I want to come back here,

01:51:24.621 --> 01:51:32.057
sometime. One, I would love to go to the Velvet
Cabaret again. You know, just like a date night.

01:51:32.057 --> 01:51:33.470
MARISHA: Oh, that was great. Yeah, that was fu--

01:51:33.470 --> 01:51:35.097
LIAM: Yeah, but without somebody trying to kill
us.

01:51:35.097 --> 01:51:38.530
MARISHA: -- oh my gosh, that was before we were
together. That was good times.

01:51:38.530 --> 01:51:40.178
(all laugh)

01:51:40.178 --> 01:51:43.833
LIAM: I'd like to go back without somebody trying
to murder any of us, though.

01:51:43.833 --> 01:51:45.167
MARISHA: Right, yeah.

01:51:45.167 --> 01:51:49.773
LIAM: That aside, I do have to go to the temple,
but I don't want to go.

01:51:49.773 --> 01:51:53.080
MARISHA: Why are you saying it like you have to go
to the toilet?

01:51:53.080 --> 01:51:54.965
LIAM: 'Cause that's kind of what it's like.

01:51:54.965 --> 01:51:58.757
MARISHA: Does it feel like that? Yeah. Okay.
Yeah.

01:51:58.757 --> 01:52:02.036
LIAM: Yeah, there is another shoe that's gonna
drop, probably, eventually.

01:52:02.036 --> 01:52:04.432
TALIESIN: You should probably pass that, I think.

01:52:04.432 --> 01:52:06.325
LIAM: I wanna get back to--

01:52:06.325 --> 01:52:08.405
MARISHA: (laughs) As Percy walks by.

01:52:08.405 --> 01:52:10.688
TALIESIN: No, I don't walk by. I just-- I'm amazed
that no one remembers

01:52:10.688 --> 01:52:12.464
that we can hear everything
over these earpieces.

01:52:12.464 --> 01:52:13.655
LAURA: No, you have to be touching your ear.

01:52:13.655 --> 01:52:17.601
LIAM: No, you have to hit send, my friend.

01:52:17.667 --> 01:52:20.531
MARISHA: (laughing) You have to hit send.

01:52:20.531 --> 01:52:22.244
TALIESIN: Carry on, carry on.

01:52:22.294 --> 01:52:24.069
(all laugh)

01:52:24.069 --> 01:52:27.375
LIAM: Her other shoe is gonna drop, eventually.
And I'm not ready for that.

01:52:27.375 --> 01:52:32.116
MARISHA: What are you afraid of? What do you think
she's gonna ask of you?

01:52:32.116 --> 01:52:34.326
LIAM: I don't know.

01:52:34.326 --> 01:52:40.917
MARISHA: You think she's gonna cash in on that
bargain?

01:52:40.917 --> 01:52:42.641
LIAM: Why wouldn't she?

01:52:42.641 --> 01:52:48.822
MARISHA: I thought you already considered paid up
in a way. I don't know.

01:52:48.822 --> 01:52:51.765
LIAM: I don't know.

01:52:51.765 --> 01:52:53.660
MARISHA: Sure.

01:52:53.660 --> 01:52:58.487
LIAM: But I feel like being a little selfish and
taking a little time, and when she wants me--

01:52:58.487 --> 01:53:01.873
'cause she's not talking to me at the moment--
when she wants me,

01:53:01.873 --> 01:53:06.456
she'll call. So I'd like a little time.

01:53:06.456 --> 01:53:09.581
MARISHA: Okay. What are you asking of me right
now?

01:53:09.581 --> 01:53:11.171
LIAM: Just to come back, down the road.

01:53:11.171 --> 01:53:11.812
MARISHA: Later?

01:53:11.812 --> 01:53:12.448
LIAM: Yeah.

01:53:12.448 --> 01:53:13.570
MARISHA: Do you wanna go now?

01:53:13.570 --> 01:53:14.116
LIAM: No.

01:53:14.116 --> 01:53:14.877
MARISHA: While we're here?

01:53:14.877 --> 01:53:15.563
LIAM: No.

01:53:15.563 --> 01:53:16.536
MARISHA: You're sure?

01:53:16.536 --> 01:53:18.085
LIAM: Very sure.

01:53:18.085 --> 01:53:23.092
MARISHA: So, just getting this straight.
What you're proposing is a Raven

01:53:23.092 --> 01:53:29.568
Queen-slash-Velvet date night visit back to
Vasselheim?

01:53:29.568 --> 01:53:30.842
LIAM: Well, I don't know what's gonna happen at
the--

01:53:30.842 --> 01:53:33.791
MARISHA: Like, you go to church and then we go to
the casino?

01:53:33.791 --> 01:53:35.489
LIAM: I'd probably do it the other way around?

01:53:35.489 --> 01:53:36.365
MARISHA: Sure.

01:53:36.365 --> 01:53:42.480
LIAM: Because I don't know what's gonna happen at
church. I'm talking months. Unless she rings,

01:53:42.480 --> 01:53:50.719
okay? I just want to spend some time with you,
before I have to do whatever the fuck she wants.

01:53:50.719 --> 01:53:52.518
She's going to collect.

01:53:52.518 --> 01:53:53.242
MARISHA: Mm-hm.

01:53:53.242 --> 01:53:57.877
LIAM: My sister is walking around and breathing.
Still.

01:53:57.877 --> 01:53:58.859
MARISHA: Okay.

01:53:58.859 --> 01:54:00.864
LIAM: Shocking as that is.

01:54:00.864 --> 01:54:08.612
MARISHA: I mean, the fact that any of us are still
doing that is impressive at this point.

01:54:08.612 --> 01:54:09.836
LIAM: Anyway.

01:54:09.836 --> 01:54:14.371
MARISHA: Okay, so that will be-- that's a good
date night to look forward to.

01:54:14.371 --> 01:54:16.311
Let's go home, I guess.

01:54:16.311 --> 01:54:20.371
TRAVIS: Yeah. Let's at least go see if little
lover boy has woken up.

01:54:20.371 --> 01:54:21.571
LAURA: Yeah, we've got our potions.

01:54:21.571 --> 01:54:22.951
LIAM: Way down the line.

01:54:22.951 --> 01:54:23.874
MARISHA: Way down the line.

01:54:23.874 --> 01:54:24.730
LIAM: Way down the line.

01:54:24.730 --> 01:54:31.323
MARISHA: Sure. Are you sure you don't wanna just
hop in the Raven's Spa, tonight?

01:54:31.323 --> 01:54:32.296
LAURA: Hey, Keyleth?

01:54:32.296 --> 01:54:33.033
MARISHA: Uh-huh?

01:54:33.033 --> 01:54:33.877
LIAM: Jesus.

01:54:33.877 --> 01:54:34.644
LAURA: Sorry, I just--

01:54:34.644 --> 01:54:35.342
LIAM: Who is that?

01:54:35.342 --> 01:54:36.827
LAURA: -- finished buying those potions.

01:54:36.827 --> 01:54:37.469
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:54:37.469 --> 01:54:38.778
LAURA: So, do you wanna get back to Whitestone?

01:54:38.778 --> 01:54:41.789
MARISHA: Are you okay? You're a little-- you look
a little sweaty.

01:54:41.789 --> 01:54:44.383
LAURA: No, I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine.

01:54:44.383 --> 01:54:46.437
LIAM: That little vein on the side of your
forehead--

01:54:46.437 --> 01:54:48.219
LAURA: You know what? We've made a lot of money,
and--

01:54:48.219 --> 01:54:50.524
MARISHA: Yeah, you've got the Julia Roberts vein
going. (laughs)

01:54:50.524 --> 01:54:51.337
LIAM: Who?

01:54:51.337 --> 01:54:52.401
LAURA: (laughs)

01:54:52.401 --> 01:54:53.391
MARISHA: Don't worry about it.

01:54:53.391 --> 01:54:57.061
LAURA: I really do get that thing, though,
I really do. But no, I'm okay. We're fine.

01:54:57.061 --> 01:54:59.882
Everything's fine. Except Scanlan's still
unconscious,

01:54:59.882 --> 01:55:02.154
so maybe we should go see if he's all right?

01:55:02.154 --> 01:55:03.748
MARISHA: You're right, you're right, all right.

01:55:03.748 --> 01:55:04.586
LAURA: All right.

01:55:04.586 --> 01:55:06.943
MARISHA: Let's go. Let's go. Everything's fine
here too, by the way.

01:55:06.943 --> 01:55:09.574
LAURA: Good, good, you guys didn't seem awkward at
all while I walked up.

01:55:09.574 --> 01:55:11.056
MARISHA: No, we're never awkward.

01:55:11.056 --> 01:55:11.848
TRAVIS: How do we get back?

01:55:11.848 --> 01:55:12.784
LAURA: Maybe we should go.

01:55:12.784 --> 01:55:13.666
MARISHA: Huh?

01:55:13.666 --> 01:55:14.955
LAURA: Tree. A tree? Can you still do a Tree
Stride?

01:55:14.955 --> 01:55:15.968
MARISHA: I could do a tree.

01:55:15.968 --> 01:55:16.896
LAURA: Let's do a tree.

01:55:16.896 --> 01:55:18.890
TRAVIS: We gotta leave the city, though,
right? Out of respect.

01:55:18.890 --> 01:55:20.904
LAURA: No, I don't think we have to.

01:55:20.904 --> 01:55:21.487
TRAVIS: Oh.

01:55:21.487 --> 01:55:23.175
LAURA: Druid magic's different.

01:55:23.175 --> 01:55:23.851
MARISHA: Huh?

01:55:23.851 --> 01:55:26.635
LAURA: It's not like-- It's not like showy wizard
magic.

01:55:26.635 --> 01:55:30.285
TRAVIS: These rules confuse me, but okay.

01:55:30.285 --> 01:55:32.346
LIAM: The wizard magic is like Broadway musicals?

01:55:32.346 --> 01:55:38.606
LAURA: Yeah. It's like jazz hands. And druid magic
is like modern dance.

01:55:38.606 --> 01:55:39.597
TALIESIN: Community theater.

01:55:39.597 --> 01:55:40.152
MARISHA: Yes, yes.

01:55:40.152 --> 01:55:42.481
LIAM: Brechtian theater. (pained groans)

01:55:42.481 --> 01:55:43.592
MATT: (laughs)

01:55:43.592 --> 01:55:48.331
MARISHA: If wizardry is Bob Fosse, druidism is
Twyla Tharp.

01:55:48.331 --> 01:55:49.335
MATT: There you go.

01:55:49.335 --> 01:55:50.562
TALIESIN: Wow. We went there.

01:55:50.562 --> 01:55:51.427
TRAVIS: That was good.

01:55:51.427 --> 01:55:55.526
MARISHA: I might know my modern choreographers.
Okay? Let's go back to Whitestone.

01:55:55.526 --> 01:55:56.335
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:55:56.335 --> 01:56:00.003
MATT: All righty. So you find your way back to the
Abundant Terrace,

01:56:00.003 --> 01:56:02.564
where you find a similar-sized tree,

01:56:02.564 --> 01:56:08.132
to what you arrived in. Using Transport Via
Plants, you transport yourself back to Whitestone,

01:56:08.132 --> 01:56:10.557
stepping out of the Sun Tree. Make your way--

01:56:10.557 --> 01:56:11.563
LIAM: Pfft.

01:56:11.563 --> 01:56:13.643
MATT: Where else, you would like to within
Whitestone?

01:56:13.643 --> 01:56:17.885
MARISHA: It does not make that sound. That's what
you're trying to do. It does not sound like that.

01:56:17.885 --> 01:56:18.884
LAURA: Like a little fart?

01:56:18.884 --> 01:56:20.075
MARISHA: That is not canon.

01:56:20.075 --> 01:56:21.129
LIAM: Trees don't fart out here?

01:56:21.129 --> 01:56:24.931
MARISHA: They don't. Trees don't fart, they poot,
okay.

01:56:24.931 --> 01:56:25.926
LAURA: I just start heading--

01:56:25.926 --> 01:56:27.390
LIAM: (loud pooting sound)

01:56:27.390 --> 01:56:28.224
LAURA: -- towards the castle.

01:56:28.224 --> 01:56:30.979
MATT: It's the air ashari, man. So what were you
saying?

01:56:30.979 --> 01:56:32.957
LAURA: I start heading towards the castle.

01:56:32.957 --> 01:56:35.040
TRAVIS: On the way there, I ask Percy, Percy!
Percy.

01:56:35.040 --> 01:56:36.077
MARISHA: The Cantrip Gust.

01:56:36.077 --> 01:56:38.499
TRAVIS: I know this city's, like, being rebuilt
and everything--

01:56:38.499 --> 01:56:39.457
TALIESIN: Yes.

01:56:39.457 --> 01:56:44.046
TRAVIS: -- but do you think there will ever be
like a pleasure hall, or a house of, you know,

01:56:44.046 --> 01:56:51.391
bosoms. I mean, I just want to put out like a
couple ideas as a city, bound up.

01:56:51.391 --> 01:56:55.687
TALIESIN: Of course it has one. Do I happen to
know where it is, or do I not?

01:56:55.687 --> 01:56:57.476
MATT: I mean, it hasn't been--

01:56:57.476 --> 01:56:59.346
TRAVIS: Nope, yeah, it's pretty empty right now,
I know this.

01:56:59.346 --> 01:57:00.805
MATT: -- really functional for a while.

01:57:00.805 --> 01:57:01.892
TALIESIN: I feel like it would be the sort of
thing

01:57:01.892 --> 01:57:03.638
that would have just existed for fuck all ever.

01:57:03.638 --> 01:57:04.784
TRAVIS: No, no, no, yeah.

01:57:04.784 --> 01:57:10.863
MATT: Whitestone has had-- there's generally--
There were two brothels, one was destroyed,

01:57:10.863 --> 01:57:14.714
in the Briarwoods' run.

01:57:14.714 --> 01:57:16.566
MARISHA: Is one called the House of Bosoms?

01:57:16.566 --> 01:57:17.475
SAM: Better be.

01:57:17.475 --> 01:57:18.841
MARISHA: It's like the House of Cards of porno.

01:57:18.841 --> 01:57:23.975
MATT: As one of the titled masters of Whitestone,
it could very well in the near future. Just tell

01:57:23.975 --> 01:57:26.011
me so I can add it to the campaign guide.

01:57:26.011 --> 01:57:27.495
(all laugh)

01:57:27.495 --> 01:57:29.254
TRAVIS: I'll come up with something better.

01:57:29.254 --> 01:57:30.593
SAM: International House of Bosoms

01:57:30.593 --> 01:57:31.343
TRAVIS: Yes.

01:57:31.343 --> 01:57:32.891
(all laugh)

01:57:32.891 --> 01:57:34.666
TALIESIN: Thank you.

01:57:34.666 --> 01:57:37.535
TRAVIS: With all the flags on it.

01:57:37.535 --> 01:57:39.020
TALIESIN: Would I possibly know this?

01:57:39.020 --> 01:57:41.543
TRAVIS: And six different syrups to choose from in
each room.

01:57:41.543 --> 01:57:43.591
SAM: Ahh, the silver dollars.

01:57:43.591 --> 01:57:45.146
TALIESIN: I don't even know if I would know this.

01:57:45.146 --> 01:57:46.988
MATT: You know what? Make a history check.

01:57:46.988 --> 01:57:55.031
TALIESIN: A history check? That's so-- okay.
A natural twenty.

01:57:55.031 --> 01:57:56.002
TRAVIS: Is it really?

01:57:56.002 --> 01:57:57.042
TALIESIN: Yeah.

01:57:57.042 --> 01:57:57.733
MATT: Okay.

01:57:57.733 --> 01:57:59.517
TALIESIN: That's a natural twenty, with my history
is--

01:57:59.517 --> 01:58:00.381
SAM: Whore check!

01:58:00.381 --> 01:58:01.624
(all laugh)

01:58:01.624 --> 01:58:02.989
TALIESIN: -- is a 30. That's a 30.

01:58:02.989 --> 01:58:04.571
LAURA: Percy &lt;i&gt;knows&lt;/i&gt; knows.

01:58:04.571 --> 01:58:08.681
MATT: You've never been to it, but you recall one
of your older brothers who is of age did return

01:58:08.681 --> 01:58:11.790
and tell stories of a house of--

01:58:11.790 --> 01:58:13.361
MARISHA: IHOB

01:58:13.361 --> 01:58:15.088
MATT: -- flesh and pleasure.

01:58:15.088 --> 01:58:16.569
TRAVIS: Thank god.

01:58:16.569 --> 01:58:21.189
MATT: You don't recall its name, but you know that
it existed somewhere on the western side of this

01:58:21.189 --> 01:58:25.283
city, and within a short period of time,
you could lead him to it.

01:58:25.283 --> 01:58:26.513
TALIESIN: Okay.

01:58:26.513 --> 01:58:28.457
SAM: And also that they serve a pancake with--

01:58:28.457 --> 01:58:29.814
(all laugh)

01:58:29.814 --> 01:58:31.084
TALIESIN: There's a pancake brunch.

01:58:31.084 --> 01:58:32.076
TRAVIS: Smiley face?

01:58:32.076 --> 01:58:34.101
SAM: -- some chocolate chips and a smiley face.

01:58:34.101 --> 01:58:36.260
LIAM: The ancient Sumerians would pay for sex with
silver dollars.

01:58:36.260 --> 01:58:38.739
TALIESIN: I'm honestly not sure, Grog. I really
have to think about it.

01:58:38.739 --> 01:58:40.596
I don't know if such a thing exists.

01:58:40.596 --> 01:58:44.662
TRAVIS: But I'm just saying, you know, if you need
to lean on me to develop that sort of the economy

01:58:44.662 --> 01:58:47.133
again, I'm here for you buddy.

01:58:47.133 --> 01:58:48.183
TALIESIN: That's good to know.

01:58:48.183 --> 01:58:48.787
TRAVIS: Okay.

01:58:48.787 --> 01:58:50.534
TALIESIN: That's good to know. Excellent.

01:58:50.534 --> 01:58:51.997
TRAVIS: Let's go find Scanlan.

01:58:51.997 --> 01:58:53.746
(all laugh)

01:58:53.746 --> 01:58:55.154
TALIESIN: I wonder if he's awake yet.

01:58:55.154 --> 01:58:57.865
SAM: Search for him. Wherever he might be.

01:58:57.865 --> 01:58:59.222
LAURA: Where did we leave him, again?

01:58:59.222 --> 01:59:01.526
TRAVIS: I think strapped up and covered in
mayonnaise.

01:59:01.526 --> 01:59:02.601
TALIESIN: Pudding. Pudding.

01:59:02.601 --> 01:59:03.472
TRAVIS: Pudding.

01:59:03.472 --> 01:59:04.788
LIAM: "Pudding."

01:59:04.788 --> 01:59:09.298
MATT: So you guys find your way back to castle
Whitestone, upwards to Scanlan's room. The door's

01:59:09.298 --> 01:59:15.480
partially ajar. On the inside you see Kaylie is
actually asleep. She's sitting on a stool next to

01:59:15.480 --> 01:59:23.355
the bed and her head's down, and she's very
lightly snoring. And there, in the bed, as you

01:59:23.355 --> 01:59:25.282
left him, is Scanlan.

01:59:25.282 --> 01:59:26.934
LAURA: His arms are still up?

01:59:26.934 --> 01:59:28.537
MATT: Well, he's been turned.

01:59:28.537 --> 01:59:29.500
LAURA: Okay.

01:59:29.500 --> 01:59:31.560
TALIESIN: We've had people taking care of that.

01:59:31.560 --> 01:59:32.570
LAURA: Jeez.

01:59:32.570 --> 01:59:34.880
TRAVIS: And Kaylie's sitting in the chair,
or is she leaning back on?

01:59:34.880 --> 01:59:37.677
MATT: No, she's leaning back in a chair and is
passed out. Scanlan is still on the bed.

01:59:37.677 --> 01:59:39.732
TRAVIS: Can I please knock the legs of the chair
out?

01:59:39.732 --> 01:59:43.209
TALIESIN: There's seven children in this family,
I think they're used to some tomfoolery.

01:59:43.209 --> 01:59:45.406
LAURA: It's up to you, Grog.

01:59:45.406 --> 01:59:49.496
TRAVIS: Yeah. I walk over and I just kick the back
leg of the chair out so she falls down.

01:59:49.496 --> 01:59:52.885
MATT: (falling sound) (yelps)

01:59:52.885 --> 01:59:56.919
TRAVIS: Oh my god, these chairs are so old.
Are you all right?

01:59:56.919 --> 01:59:58.227
MATT: Oh, I'm gonna remember that.

01:59:58.294 --> 02:00:00.045
TRAVIS: Oh right, I forgot, you'll speed bag my
nuts later, sorry.

02:00:00.199 --> 02:00:04.345
LAURA: How you doing, Kaylie?

02:00:04.345 --> 02:00:07.916
MATT: She looks groggy and slightly hung over and
is like,

02:00:07.980 --> 02:00:16.472
"All right. So, you've all come back? He hasn't
really done nothing"

02:00:16.472 --> 02:00:22.242
And she kinda smacks him in the side of the face
and wipes some of the pudding off. You hear,

02:00:22.242 --> 02:00:29.521
just ever so faintly, as you kinda are coming out
of your stupor, you hear what sounds like voices

02:00:29.521 --> 02:00:36.287
muffled, and it comes to, you hear what sounds
like Grog, and then what sounds like Kaylie,

02:00:36.287 --> 02:00:40.803
and then something hits you in the cheek and you
feel a slight tinge of pain like a flick.

02:00:40.803 --> 02:00:45.451
But your eyes begin to blink, and you guys watch
as Scanlan begins to stir.

02:00:45.451 --> 02:00:47.344
LAURA: How long has he been like this?

02:00:47.344 --> 02:00:48.721
LIAM: Why is he covered in pudding?

02:00:48.721 --> 02:00:49.846
LAURA: Who did this to him?

02:00:49.846 --> 02:00:50.793
TALIESIN: I have no idea.

02:00:50.793 --> 02:00:51.765
SAM: What's going on?

02:00:51.765 --> 02:00:54.611
MARISHA: Keyleth takes a little bit of the gunk
off and what is it?

02:00:54.611 --> 02:00:55.695
LAURA: Gross.

02:00:55.695 --> 02:00:57.335
MATT: It's like a vanilla custard.

02:00:57.335 --> 02:00:58.191
LIAM: Thank God.

02:00:58.191 --> 02:00:59.846
LAURA: That's fucking foul, Keyleth.

02:00:59.846 --> 02:01:05.265
MARISHA: Look. How do you think druids discover
things, okay? Someone has to figure out what's

02:01:05.265 --> 02:01:06.156
poison and what's not.

02:01:06.156 --> 02:01:07.014
LIAM: Sour.

02:01:07.014 --> 02:01:08.192
TALIESIN: They lick them apparently.

02:01:08.192 --> 02:01:11.150
MATT: It's a little sour.

02:01:11.150 --> 02:01:13.713
MARISHA: This is funny. This is funny, was this
you? This is funny!

02:01:13.713 --> 02:01:15.291
SAM: Hello. Hello?

02:01:15.291 --> 02:01:16.629
MATT: You guys hear Scanlan talking.

02:01:16.629 --> 02:01:17.688
SAM: Hello? What's going--

02:01:17.688 --> 02:01:18.882
LAURA: Scanlan! (gasps)

02:01:18.882 --> 02:01:19.741
SAM: Hi.

02:01:19.741 --> 02:01:20.637
LIAM: Hey, buddy.

02:01:20.637 --> 02:01:22.235
LAURA (sing-songy) Welcome back!

02:01:22.235 --> 02:01:25.458
SAM: What-- where am I?

02:01:25.458 --> 02:01:27.865
TALIESIN: You missed all the fun.

02:01:27.865 --> 02:01:29.189
SAM: What's going on, where am I?

02:01:29.189 --> 02:01:32.239
LIAM: This is the afterlife, Scanlan, you've gone
to the good place.

02:01:32.239 --> 02:01:38.819
MATT: Your hands are bound up over your head
currently, and you are dressed in a nightgown and

02:01:38.819 --> 02:01:45.626
your room and yourself are, there's spatters of
pudding everywhere.

02:01:45.626 --> 02:01:48.090
SAM: What's going on? Why am I like this? Where am
I?

02:01:48.090 --> 02:01:50.540
LAURA: You don't remember?

02:01:50.540 --> 02:01:52.966
SAM: No. Is the dragon alive?

02:01:52.966 --> 02:01:57.674
LAURA: No, you killed it, and then we all
celebrated, and you had a big orgy.

02:01:57.674 --> 02:02:01.200
TRAVIS: Yeah, you proposed to this woman
downstairs and this was your bachelor party.

02:02:01.200 --> 02:02:04.189
MARISHA: You clearly have some very intense
dreams, Scanlan.

02:02:04.189 --> 02:02:06.244
SAM: I feel like you're fucking with me.

02:02:06.244 --> 02:02:08.333
(all laugh)

02:02:08.333 --> 02:02:10.294
MATT: And you hear Kaylie's voice,

02:02:10.294 --> 02:02:15.024
"Oh, you think that? Probably right true."

02:02:15.024 --> 02:02:17.926
SAM: What are you doing here?

02:02:17.926 --> 02:02:20.728
MATT: Well, apparently your friends brought me
along to

02:02:20.728 --> 02:02:24.151
make sure that you woke up nice and right.

02:02:24.151 --> 02:02:26.100
SAM: They brought you here?

02:02:26.100 --> 02:02:27.593
MATT: Aye.

02:02:27.593 --> 02:02:30.089
SAM: Where are-- are we in Whitestone?

02:02:30.089 --> 02:02:30.666
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:02:30.666 --> 02:02:31.826
LIAM: We're in Whitestone.

02:02:31.826 --> 02:02:34.921
LAURA: Yeah.

02:02:34.921 --> 02:02:37.656
TALIESIN: And the dragon is very dead. Very,
very dead.

02:02:37.656 --> 02:02:43.136
LAURA: But you are not. And that's very important.

02:02:43.136 --> 02:02:48.156
SAM: Kaylie, could you excuse us a moment?

02:02:48.156 --> 02:02:50.153
MATT: "Aye, but at the very least--"

02:02:50.153 --> 02:02:56.434
And she reaches over and undoes the bindings on
your wrists. Your fingers are a little numb.

02:02:56.434 --> 02:03:00.172
You pull back and kind of rub them instinctually.
She goes,

02:03:00.172 --> 02:03:03.739
"Don't take too long. I've a mind to speak to you
in a minute."

02:03:03.739 --> 02:03:04.720
LAURA: Kaylie?

02:03:04.720 --> 02:03:05.760
MATT: Aye?

02:03:05.760 --> 02:03:06.900
LAURA: Thank you.

02:03:06.900 --> 02:03:13.466
MATT: "Sure." She just kind of storms past and
pushes, a little gnome figure pushing through the

02:03:13.466 --> 02:03:18.571
crowd of Vox Machina, and out of the room.

02:03:18.571 --> 02:03:29.387
SAM: I'm sorry I... fell again. Can someone answer
me one thing, though?

02:03:29.387 --> 02:03:34.755
Who got Kaylie? Who brought Kaylie here?

02:03:34.755 --> 02:03:35.849
TRAVIS: Vex did.

02:03:35.849 --> 02:03:37.950
LAURA: I sit down on the bed with you.

02:03:37.950 --> 02:03:40.045
Well, it just seemed like the logical thing
to do, dear.

02:03:40.045 --> 02:03:42.526
SAM: Why the fuck would you do that?

02:03:42.526 --> 02:03:46.665
LAURA: Right. Well, 'cause you said that--

02:03:46.665 --> 02:03:50.484
SAM: I promised her that I wasn't going to die,
and you showed her my dead body.

02:03:50.484 --> 02:03:52.433
You thought that was a good idea?

02:03:52.433 --> 02:03:54.943
LAURA: What! Would you rather she just discover it
on her own? This way she--

02:03:54.943 --> 02:03:57.234
SAM: No! I'd rather she never know.

02:03:57.234 --> 02:04:05.248
LAURA: Scanlan. She came here. She helped bring
you back. You know what that means, right?

02:04:05.248 --> 02:04:08.638
SAM: Yes, I do, unfortunately.

02:04:08.638 --> 02:04:11.833
LAURA: You think it's bad that she cares about
you?

02:04:11.833 --> 02:04:15.039
SAM: I think it's bad that she thinks that I'm an
oathbreaker,

02:04:15.039 --> 02:04:20.265
that I am weak, that I failed in my
promise to her.

02:04:20.265 --> 02:04:21.441
LAURA: Scanlan.

02:04:21.441 --> 02:04:26.907
SAM: That everything she thought of me when she
found me is confirmed now. That I can't be

02:04:26.907 --> 02:04:29.694
trusted, and I can't protect her.

02:04:29.694 --> 02:04:37.580
LAURA: Scanlan. She thought nothing of you when
you met her, all right? The fact that she showed

02:04:37.580 --> 02:04:43.962
up here and saw that you gave your life for a
greater cause? That's so much more important than

02:04:43.962 --> 02:04:50.832
any promise you made.

02:04:50.832 --> 02:04:54.600
SAM: I hope that's true.

02:04:54.600 --> 02:04:59.538
LAURA: I think it is. She didn't run away.
And after the fact

02:04:59.538 --> 02:05:03.033
she stayed here and looked after you!

02:05:03.033 --> 02:05:05.020
LIAM: You should have heard her play.

02:05:05.020 --> 02:05:11.627
SAM: I did. I think. I heard music. I heard Pike.

02:05:11.627 --> 02:05:16.172
LAURA: Wait. You heard?

02:05:16.172 --> 02:05:27.329
SAM: I heard voices. I heard Pike saying a poem.
I heard someone playing music.

02:05:27.329 --> 02:05:31.535
TRAVIS: Was that it?

02:05:31.535 --> 02:05:33.244
SAM: Yes.

02:05:33.244 --> 02:05:46.999
LIAM: All your daughter knows is that you stood
against great evil overtaking an entire continent.

02:05:46.999 --> 02:05:52.589
That's nothing to sneeze at, Scanlan.

02:05:52.589 --> 02:06:00.384
SAM: She also knows that I fell and that my
friends thought it would be funny to put me in a

02:06:00.384 --> 02:06:03.937
fucking nightgown and spread pudding all over me.

02:06:03.937 --> 02:06:05.537
TALIESIN: That was me.

02:06:05.537 --> 02:06:17.511
SAM: And bring back my lifeless body and show her
how weak her father is. That's what she saw.

02:06:17.511 --> 02:06:25.097
I made a promise, and I broke it, and you proved
it to her. And I wish you hadn't meddled in my

02:06:25.097 --> 02:06:31.444
affairs. I don't have... I don't have many things
that I care about,

02:06:31.444 --> 02:06:34.232
and I don't have anything that cares about me.

02:06:34.232 --> 02:06:35.297
LAURA: That's a lie.

02:06:35.297 --> 02:06:36.451
TRAVIS: That is bullshit.

02:06:36.451 --> 02:06:37.425
MARISHA: Definitely not true.

02:06:37.425 --> 02:06:38.686
LIAM: That's full bullshit.

02:06:38.686 --> 02:06:40.810
SAM: What? You think you care about me?

02:06:40.810 --> 02:06:41.330
TRAVIS: Yes.

02:06:41.330 --> 02:06:42.792
LIAM: Yes, asshole! Yes.

02:06:42.792 --> 02:06:49.494
SAM: Yes, I'm sorry, you're right. You like me
because I make jokes, and I play songs, and I give

02:06:49.494 --> 02:06:54.899
you a warm place to stay at night, and I feed you
fucking chicken, and I heal you in battle.

02:06:54.899 --> 02:07:00.796
But you don't really care about me. Come on.
Let's be honest with each other. You don't really

02:07:00.796 --> 02:07:01.931
give a shit about me.

02:07:01.931 --> 02:07:05.953
LIAM: I've changed my outlook on life because of
you! What the fuck are you talking about? Of

02:07:05.953 --> 02:07:07.061
course we all love you--

02:07:07.061 --> 02:07:08.414
SAM: Prove it.

02:07:08.414 --> 02:07:10.081
LIAM: -- you could crush me in a second.

02:07:10.081 --> 02:07:10.723
SAM: Prove it.

02:07:10.723 --> 02:07:11.414
LIAM: How?

02:07:11.414 --> 02:07:13.208
LAURA: What do you want us to do?

02:07:13.208 --> 02:07:19.055
SAM: We traveled into the fucking nine hells to
get Pike a set of armor. We went and battled a

02:07:19.055 --> 02:07:25.732
city of vampires so Percy could feel good about
his name. We fought goliaths for Grog. We've

02:07:25.732 --> 02:07:31.432
traveled across planes of existence so you could
fix your fucking daddy issues. But you've never

02:07:31.432 --> 02:07:38.527
done anything for me. Ever! You've never risked
anything, you don't know me, you don't know

02:07:38.527 --> 02:07:49.177
anything about me. What's my mother's name? What's
her name? Easy question. Died in front of me.

02:07:49.177 --> 02:08:02.472
Killed by a goblin. Biggest part of my life.
What's her name? My father. Is he alive or dead?

02:08:02.472 --> 02:08:06.541
How old am I? Where's my fucking dog?

02:08:06.541 --> 02:08:07.417
LAURA: We did get the dog.

02:08:07.417 --> 02:08:08.561
SAM: You don't care about me.

02:08:08.561 --> 02:08:09.947
LAURA: We did get your dog.

02:08:09.947 --> 02:08:10.653
SAM: Did you?

02:08:10.653 --> 02:08:11.429
TRAVIS: No, we didn't.

02:08:11.429 --> 02:08:12.355
LAURA: We did, I searched--

02:08:12.355 --> 02:08:14.835
LIAM: I've asked your age.

02:08:14.835 --> 02:08:18.371
LAURA: I thought I did the magic search.
Fucking hell.

02:08:18.371 --> 02:08:25.417
SAM: It's fine. I'm just a little hungover from
being dead, and I just have been thinking for a

02:08:25.417 --> 02:08:39.343
while, and, you know. Grog has Pike. Vax has
Keyleth. Percy has Vex. But Scanlan has no one,

02:08:39.343 --> 02:08:48.144
and I had one chance at one real relationship
with my daughter, and I feel like you've gone and

02:08:48.144 --> 02:08:54.078
fucked it up, too. Because you don't really know
me, and you don't really know what my relationship

02:08:54.078 --> 02:09:03.707
is with her, and what I've promised her,
or anything, really. And it's fine. When I met

02:09:03.707 --> 02:09:14.585
you all, I was just a funny little man playing
songs, and that's all I'll ever really be.

02:09:14.585 --> 02:09:21.399
And that's okay, because I can take care of
myself.

02:09:21.399 --> 02:09:31.756
LAURA: You don't have to, Scanlan. Nobody knew
that any of this was going on. How many times have

02:09:31.756 --> 02:09:37.749
we asked you if you're all right and you just
laugh and joke? We can't help you if you don't

02:09:37.749 --> 02:09:45.167
tell us what's going on.

02:09:45.167 --> 02:09:47.198
SAM: I don't need your help.

02:09:47.198 --> 02:09:48.923
LAURA: Well, apparently you do, darling.

02:09:48.923 --> 02:09:51.101
SAM: I don't like that very much at all.

02:09:51.101 --> 02:09:55.967
LAURA: Get used to it. Nobody likes needing
someone.

02:09:55.967 --> 02:10:01.045
MARISHA: Scanlan, do you think any of us could
have gotten here without each other? I thought you

02:10:01.045 --> 02:10:05.737
knew that more than the rest of us. Maybe we just
thought

02:10:05.737 --> 02:10:12.974
you didn't need us as much as you felt
like we didn't.

02:10:12.974 --> 02:10:15.995
LIAM: I thought you were the only one who had
everything figured out.

02:10:15.995 --> 02:10:18.558
MARISHA: I did too.

02:10:18.558 --> 02:10:20.399
SAM: Well then, I must be a very good liar.

02:10:20.399 --> 02:10:21.969
MARISHA and LAURA: You are.

02:10:21.969 --> 02:10:30.922
LIAM: I thought for months, what haven't I got
figured out that Scanlan has got figured out? I've

02:10:30.922 --> 02:10:41.205
been trapped in the mud for months, wondering what
I could do to get where you are. Scanlan,

02:10:41.205 --> 02:10:46.670
you fucking saved the world with us. If your
daughter can't see that,

02:10:46.670 --> 02:10:51.778
then she can't see anything.

02:10:51.778 --> 02:10:57.585
SAM: Yeah. If you really respected me, you
wouldn't pick me up like some sort of dwarf and

02:10:57.585 --> 02:11:03.715
pick me up and put me down and take off your
fucking armor and treat me like a fucking child.

02:11:03.715 --> 02:11:09.692
LIAM: You've thrown some of us like baseballs.
I don't know what that is.

02:11:09.692 --> 02:11:13.761
MARISHA: Scanlan. Do you wish we wouldn't have
brought you back? Should we not have done that?

02:11:13.761 --> 02:11:17.004
SAM: I just wish you wouldn't have brought her
into this.

02:11:17.004 --> 02:11:17.709
MARISHA: Scanlan--

02:11:17.709 --> 02:11:23.981
SAM: I had one shot with her, and now how will I
ever show her that I can be trusted? How will I

02:11:23.981 --> 02:11:25.910
ever show her that I can protect her?

02:11:25.910 --> 02:11:27.982
LAURA: Well, maybe you should fucking talk to
her.

02:11:27.982 --> 02:11:31.843
MARISHA: Yeah, you're a better father than most of
us have ever had.

02:11:31.843 --> 02:11:33.665
SAM: You're right. I should talk to her.

02:11:33.665 --> 02:11:34.540
LAURA: You should!

02:11:34.540 --> 02:11:36.188
SAM: I should! I should. And I will.

02:11:36.188 --> 02:11:39.349
LAURA: Don't treat her like a fucking sacred
object, treat her like a daughter, Scanlan.

02:11:39.349 --> 02:11:46.948
SAM: Fine. You're right. I will. I will.
I'll talk to her. Listen. I don't know what

02:11:46.948 --> 02:11:54.488
adventure we're going on next, but I think you
should go without me.

02:11:54.488 --> 02:11:58.770
TRAVIS: Really?

02:11:58.770 --> 02:12:02.138
SAM: Vex is right. I should talk to her.
I should be here for her. I don't know why I

02:12:02.138 --> 02:12:08.188
wasn't with her in the first place. I didn't need
to go with you to kill the dragons. I should've

02:12:08.188 --> 02:12:13.339
just been with her in the first place. Probably
just scared to.

02:12:13.339 --> 02:12:20.197
I should just be her father and stay.

02:12:20.197 --> 02:12:23.342
TRAVIS: Can I ask you a question?

02:12:23.342 --> 02:12:28.787
SAM: Yeah. No, I will not go whoring with you one
more time.

02:12:28.787 --> 02:12:34.499
TRAVIS: No. I was gonna ask you what your mother's
name is.

02:12:34.559 --> 02:12:36.807
SAM: It was Juniper.

02:12:36.807 --> 02:12:42.251
TRAVIS: I'm sorry I didn't know that.

02:12:42.251 --> 02:12:46.153
SAM: Thank you for asking.

02:12:46.153 --> 02:12:49.167
LAURA: Is your father still alive?

02:12:49.167 --> 02:13:07.058
SAM: I don't really know. He makes things.
Made things, I don't know. His name is Vicou.

02:13:07.058 --> 02:13:20.265
TRAVIS: I'm glad you're back. Whatever you want to
do now that you are... it's up to you, mate.

02:13:20.265 --> 02:13:23.158
MARISHA: I'm sorry if we had selfish intentions.

02:13:23.158 --> 02:13:28.407
TRAVIS: We did have selfish in--

02:13:28.407 --> 02:13:33.610
MARISHA: Yeah. Grog knows what I'm trying to say.

02:13:33.610 --> 02:13:40.642
TRAVIS: We didn't think about those things.
We didn't. We thought about what you meant to us.

02:13:40.642 --> 02:13:48.027
It may not feel like much, to us it feels like a
bit, but now that you're here...

02:13:48.027 --> 02:13:55.726
MARISHA: Scanlan, as much as you can say that you
were just the funny guy who played music and made

02:13:55.726 --> 02:14:06.174
jokes, I don't think you realize how desperately
we need that. That's nothing to scoff at,

02:14:06.174 --> 02:14:13.567
that's not a talent that many of us naturally
possess. You've taught me so much about the

02:14:13.567 --> 02:14:21.466
brightness of the world, and to look at the light
side of things.

02:14:21.466 --> 02:14:26.124
SAM: I guess it's just easier to laugh at the
world when you don't care about it.

02:14:26.124 --> 02:14:29.699
MARISHA: That's not true. You do care.

02:14:29.699 --> 02:14:31.916
SAM: I know.

02:14:31.916 --> 02:14:37.635
LAURA: That's why he's an asshole now.

02:14:37.635 --> 02:14:43.692
LIAM: We've never had one conversation, you and I,
about my mother. Where my sister and I came from.

02:14:43.692 --> 02:14:46.680
Did you know Thordak killed her?

02:14:46.680 --> 02:14:48.215
SAM: I think that's come up.

02:14:48.215 --> 02:14:54.918
LIAM: We've never talked about it. Not once.
Because I didn't want to talk about it.

02:14:54.918 --> 02:15:00.384
I didn't push into your private life. If you
wanted to talk to me, and you did, about your

02:15:00.384 --> 02:15:05.059
daughter. We did. We talked in the sewers of
Westruun about your daughter because you wanted to

02:15:05.059 --> 02:15:10.013
talk about her. We love you, Scanlan, and if you
want to talk about your mother or your father,

02:15:10.013 --> 02:15:18.372
we will. You have not been exactly forthcoming.

02:15:18.372 --> 02:15:26.291
SAM: That's fair. I haven't been. But I also
don't-- I don't have anyone.

02:15:26.291 --> 02:15:39.297
I have to take care of myself. That's all.

02:15:39.297 --> 02:15:42.795
LIAM: We have survived a fucking hellscape.
All of us.

02:15:42.795 --> 02:15:45.203
SAM: (quietly) I didn't.

02:15:45.203 --> 02:15:49.180
LIAM: You are standing before me, talking to me.
You did.

02:15:49.180 --> 02:15:51.485
SAM: I did not. I died. Twice.

02:15:51.485 --> 02:15:53.159
LIAM: That's fucking semantics, Shorthalt.

02:15:53.159 --> 02:15:55.857
SAM: In a row.

02:15:55.857 --> 02:16:00.580
LIAM: You've been brought back. You're standing
here. Your daughter is there and needs you.

02:16:00.580 --> 02:16:10.358
SAM: I'm being kept alive by some fucked-up weird
magic. Before I met you people, I would have

02:16:10.358 --> 02:16:17.322
never-- the worst I would have gotten in is a bar
fight. And I would have won. 'Cause I would have

02:16:17.322 --> 02:16:29.399
been a liar and a cheater. And now, I didn't help
any of you in the last fight. I didn't do

02:16:29.399 --> 02:16:34.338
anything. The fight before that, I didn't do
anything--

02:16:34.338 --> 02:16:35.444
LIAM: What about the fight before that?

02:16:35.444 --> 02:16:36.519
SAM: -- I'm useless!

02:16:36.519 --> 02:16:37.601
LAURA: (tiredly) No, you're not.

02:16:37.601 --> 02:16:44.437
SAM: -- I'm out of my league. I'm out of my
league. Listen, it was fun. It's fun. It really

02:16:44.437 --> 02:16:52.813
has been fun to travel with six legends. It's fun.
It's fun to say

02:16:52.813 --> 02:16:56.994
that your friends are legendary fighters. 
It's fun!

02:16:56.994 --> 02:17:05.440
LIAM: Excuse me! Speaking as someone who has been
fucking depressed for a long time-- Look me in the

02:17:05.440 --> 02:17:19.841
eye. I was shit for months. And you are one of the
main reasons I am out of that now. We would be

02:17:19.841 --> 02:17:30.984
dead, all of us, if it weren't for you. The first
time we fought Raishan, we would all be dead.

02:17:30.984 --> 02:17:35.352
You are in a pity party right now, and I know
you're hurting, and I'm sorry you're hurting,

02:17:35.352 --> 02:17:41.112
and I love you. But you are lying to yourself,
that you have been no use to us. You are lying to

02:17:41.112 --> 02:17:51.815
yourself. &nbsp;If you wanna retire, if you wanna go
off with your daughter, that's fucking wonderful.

02:17:51.815 --> 02:17:56.198
I encourage you to do it. But don't lie to
yourself.

02:17:56.198 --> 02:18:06.061
SAM: Well, that's just it. I'm a really good
liar.

02:18:06.061 --> 02:18:10.098
LIAM: (pleading) Scanlan.

02:18:10.098 --> 02:18:14.828
SAM: Just give me some time.

02:18:14.828 --> 02:18:23.901
MARISHA: (timidly) Hey-- hey, guys? We're friends,
right? Are we friends?

02:18:23.901 --> 02:18:25.209
TALIESIN: Worse, family.

02:18:25.209 --> 02:18:26.308
LIAM: Family.

02:18:26.308 --> 02:18:31.917
MARISHA: That's fair.

02:18:31.917 --> 02:18:35.838
TALIESIN: And for fuck's sake, sir, I will say I
died in that fight too.

02:18:35.838 --> 02:18:37.086
SAM: It's not fun, is it?

02:18:37.086 --> 02:18:44.162
TALIESIN: No. And let me tell you something.
Whatever lie you were trying to feed your

02:18:44.162 --> 02:18:48.102
daughter out there about the man she thought you
might be, that you just thought you could tell her

02:18:48.102 --> 02:18:51.664
and then she would walk away and never actually
meet you or get to know you. So that maybe she

02:18:51.664 --> 02:19:03.023
would never see what a shit you can be. And you
can be a shit. That fucking girl out there is a

02:19:03.023 --> 02:19:13.608
shit too. She's a miserable, lying shit.
And for fuck's sake, the thing that brought her

02:19:13.608 --> 02:19:17.644
back here was the things about you that you don't
like about yourself. And don't think that they

02:19:17.644 --> 02:19:28.003
don't count, either. You're a shitty person,
we know! That's not the fucking point. The point

02:19:28.003 --> 02:19:44.895
is for just one moment-- one moment-- once in a
blue bloody moon... You come through in a way that

02:19:44.895 --> 02:19:51.214
others can't. And you do it, and we love you for
it, and you are worthwhile, there's a reason we

02:19:51.214 --> 02:20:02.168
just nearly went mad trying to bring you back.
And it was not pity. And we didn't bring her-- we

02:20:02.168 --> 02:20:09.338
brought her here so that maybe she would snap you
out of wherever the fuck you were going to.

02:20:09.338 --> 02:20:14.305
And I know you're not out of there yet,
I've been where you are and I know it's shit.

02:20:14.305 --> 02:20:20.662
And I would really recommend, as somebody who
misses an awful lot of people, that you are honest

02:20:20.662 --> 02:20:29.250
with that girl and maybe discover that she
actually likes you. As a person. Because you are

02:20:29.250 --> 02:20:34.983
actually likeable as a person! I know, it's coming
out of my mouth. I can feel the shit from it but

02:20:34.983 --> 02:20:43.226
it's true. And for fuck's sake, get to know her
and stop making false promises that you can

02:20:43.226 --> 02:20:49.338
protect her, and you'll always be there.
'Cause you can't and you won't. No one can.

02:20:49.338 --> 02:20:56.195
And you're fucking lying! And it's sick.
Be a man. Be a man. I've seen you be a man,

02:20:56.195 --> 02:21:02.099
I know you can fucking do it. And when you're done
with that, and we will leave you with that fucking

02:21:02.318 --> 02:21:09.741
shit girl, I would like you to look up my parents'
name. You can find it on every fifth hallway in

02:21:09.741 --> 02:21:15.092
this fucking city. And then I'm out.

02:21:15.092 --> 02:21:16.685
MATT: (hoarsely) You leave the room?

02:21:16.685 --> 02:21:17.562
TALIESIN: Mm-hm.

02:21:17.562 --> 02:21:21.810
MATT: (clears throat) Okay. As you push the door
open-- it's still partially ajar-- and as you push

02:21:21.810 --> 02:21:24.988
it open, leaning against the wall just by the door
is Kaylie,

02:21:24.988 --> 02:21:28.501
and you can see she has tears streaming
down her face.

02:21:28.501 --> 02:21:30.468
TALIESIN: I give her a big hug, a kiss on the
forehead--

02:21:30.468 --> 02:21:35.278
MATT: She doesn't let you. As soon as you go for
it, she just kind of smacks it away--

02:21:35.278 --> 02:21:36.158
TALIESIN: (makes an air kissing noise)

02:21:36.158 --> 02:21:40.744
MAT: --turns into the room, and just kind of walks
past everyone and grabs her bag off the ground.

02:21:40.744 --> 02:21:51.411
Slings it over her shoulder, grabs her violin
case. "So, you coming?"

02:21:51.411 --> 02:21:55.325
SAM: ...Yeah.

02:21:55.325 --> 02:22:02.229
MATT: "Grab your things. Be waiting for you
downstairs." And she walks out.

02:22:02.229 --> 02:22:09.746
LAURA: Really? Just like that?

02:22:09.746 --> 02:22:13.902
SAM: I have to.

02:22:13.902 --> 02:22:16.459
MARISHA: Where're you going to go? What're you
going to do?

02:22:16.459 --> 02:22:24.594
SAM: I'm just gonna be a Shorthalt for a while.
And I'm just gonna figure out what that means.

02:22:24.594 --> 02:22:38.905
And... it's great being part of a team,
but you gotta know who you are first. So I gotta

02:22:38.905 --> 02:22:51.050
go figure that out. And I gotta go figure out what
she is, too. And when I do, I'll come back and

02:22:51.050 --> 02:23:02.571
find you. And if you really need a place to stay,
I'll advise you to buy some tents, 'cause you

02:23:02.571 --> 02:23:14.611
won't have a mansion anymore. I know you'll be
fine 'cause you all have each other, but for now,

02:23:14.611 --> 02:23:27.848
I just need to have me for a while. I love you
all. I even love Percy... and his parents,

02:23:27.848 --> 02:23:36.616
Frederick and Johanna. And I'll go with Kaylie.

02:23:36.616 --> 02:23:44.657
TRAVIS: Wait. I reach into the Bag of Holding and
I grab my salt-lick rock and I toss it to Scanlan.

02:23:44.657 --> 02:23:46.764
SAM: What's this?

02:23:46.764 --> 02:23:56.273
TRAVIS: It's yours now. When you miss us-- I know
you will-- give it a lick.

02:23:56.273 --> 02:24:06.322
SAM: (choked) All right, I will.

02:24:06.322 --> 02:24:09.407
LAURA: I grab the Gatestone off the end table
where

02:24:09.407 --> 02:24:19.845
we left it with him and hand it over to you
as well.

02:24:19.845 --> 02:24:21.789
SAM: You'll need this.

02:24:21.789 --> 02:24:30.899
LAURA: I'd rather it go to you.

02:24:30.899 --> 02:24:42.182
SAM: When Vex tries to give you something,
you take it. All right. Don't die.

02:24:42.182 --> 02:24:56.116
LIAM: Scanlan... We'll miss you.

02:24:56.116 --> 02:25:18.993
SAM: (exhales) I hope so. And... well, you said I
was right. Let's pick up that conversation later.

02:25:18.993 --> 02:25:21.248
I'll go out the door.

02:25:21.248 --> 02:25:31.067
MATT: Okay. As he walks down the hall, you hear
his feet across the stonework echo quieter and

02:25:31.067 --> 02:25:33.916
quieter until you can't hear it anymore,
and you all

02:25:33.916 --> 02:25:38.219
stand in stunned silence in the chamber.

02:25:45.611 --> 02:25:47.044
LIAM: (draws in a breath) Fuck.

02:25:47.044 --> 02:25:51.688
LAURA: I just pick up a pillow and throw it at the
door.

02:25:51.688 --> 02:25:59.853
MATT: It opens slightly. The pillow lays on the
ground smattered with vanilla pudding.

02:25:59.853 --> 02:26:03.137
TRAVIS: Did he take all his things with him?

02:26:03.137 --> 02:26:13.461
MATT: I would say he would've grabbed his things
as he left, yeah.

02:26:13.461 --> 02:26:16.870
LAURA: Well, that didn't go like I thought it
would.

02:26:16.870 --> 02:26:21.631
MARISHA: No. No it didn't.

02:26:21.631 --> 02:26:25.369
LAURA: Kinda wish we would've gone drinking in
Vasselheim now.

02:26:25.369 --> 02:26:28.835
TRAVIS: We might've missed him if we had.

02:26:28.835 --> 02:26:37.072
LIAM: (wearily) We saved the continent, why does
everything feel like shit?

02:26:37.072 --> 02:26:42.235
TRAVIS: He's alive. That's what really matters.

02:26:42.235 --> 02:26:45.897
LIAM: But he's our liar, Grog.

02:26:45.897 --> 02:26:48.189
LAURA: (tearily) And he hates us, now.

02:26:48.189 --> 02:26:53.014
MARISHA: He doesn't hate us.

02:26:53.218 --> 02:26:57.818
I just... think we've all just discovered
that maybe we have a lot more secrets about

02:26:57.818 --> 02:27:10.055
ourselves than we've all ever let on.

02:27:10.055 --> 02:27:19.171
TRAVIS: He needs time. We have that.

02:27:19.171 --> 02:27:25.214
LAURA: (angrily) Fuck him! Fuck him for not saying
anything sooner.

02:27:25.214 --> 02:27:31.825
MARISHA: I dunno.

02:27:31.825 --> 02:27:37.625
LAURA: And fuck us for not asking. (sniffs)

02:27:37.625 --> 02:27:50.663
MARISHA: I think Percy's right. We're worse than
friends, we're family. And family leaves.

02:27:50.663 --> 02:28:00.463
LIAM: Yes. They do.

02:28:00.463 --> 02:28:05.088
MARISHA: Can we not be family? Can we, like,
redact that?

02:28:05.088 --> 02:28:16.222
LIAM: I don't think so. I think it's too late.

02:28:17.929 --> 02:28:21.380
TRAVIS: I step out into the hallway. Do I see
Percy at all?

02:28:21.380 --> 02:28:24.178
TALIESIN: I'm around the corner, up on the--

02:28:24.178 --> 02:28:25.331
MATT: Yeah.

02:28:25.331 --> 02:28:28.394
TALIESIN: I'm outside of-- If you went far enough,
you'd see me.

02:28:28.394 --> 02:28:30.034
MATT: You eventually find Percy, yeah.

02:28:30.034 --> 02:28:31.286
TRAVIS: Hey.

02:28:31.286 --> 02:28:33.413
TALIESIN: Hi.

02:28:33.413 --> 02:28:35.626
TRAVIS: Rough one, that. Question:

02:28:35.626 --> 02:28:36.573
TALIESIN: Yeah.

02:28:36.573 --> 02:28:41.376
TRAVIS: Do you have any, like, sneaky people in
your employ here in the castle.

02:28:41.376 --> 02:28:44.424
TALIESIN: 'Course.

02:28:44.424 --> 02:28:53.138
TRAVIS: Wouldn't you feel better if we had
someone just keeping an eye on them? Bit

02:28:53.301 --> 02:29:00.815
explosive, the two of them together.

02:29:00.815 --> 02:29:06.285
TALIESIN: I'm torn. I don't know if he'd like
that.

02:29:06.285 --> 02:29:09.633
TRAVIS: I don't know if I care. (laughs)

02:29:09.633 --> 02:29:16.800
TALIESIN: I don't know if I do, either. I keep
thinking, I could just shout right now and half a

02:29:16.800 --> 02:29:21.602
dozen guards would stop them.

02:29:21.602 --> 02:29:30.343
TRAVIS: Yeah. It'd be half a dozen dead guards,
though.

02:29:30.343 --> 02:29:34.235
TALIESIN: Well, what's half a dozen dead guards
these days?

02:29:34.235 --> 02:29:36.616
TRAVIS: Good point.

02:29:36.616 --> 02:29:42.196
TALIESIN: There's tale of a brothel in the west
end of Whitestone. I don't know if it still exists

02:29:42.196 --> 02:29:53.342
but I'm sure if you go drinking in that area,
you might find something. Sorry.

02:29:53.342 --> 02:29:59.801
TRAVIS: No, yeah. Yeah. I'll go give it a look.

02:29:59.801 --> 02:30:03.102
TALIESIN: When you're in the mood.

02:30:03.102 --> 02:30:14.791
TRAVIS: Now's good. Yeah, I'll be back after
nightfall. Gonna go out for a bit.

02:30:14.791 --> 02:30:15.679
TALIESIN: Grog.

02:30:15.679 --> 02:30:22.245
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:30:22.245 --> 02:30:26.934
TALIESIN: I know we don't always agree, and I know
that I can be unkind but...

02:30:26.934 --> 02:30:31.585
you know you're family, right?

02:30:31.585 --> 02:30:36.442
TRAVIS: I don't know much, but I do know that.

02:30:36.442 --> 02:30:43.941
TALIESIN: It's nice having an older brother again.

02:30:43.941 --> 02:30:49.932
TRAVIS: I leave.

02:30:49.978 --> 02:30:55.128
MARISHA: So what, just-- the half-elves are left
alone in a room covered in pudding?

02:30:55.128 --> 02:30:55.559
MATT: Yeah.

02:30:55.559 --> 02:30:56.795
(all laugh)

02:30:56.795 --> 02:30:57.948
MATT: Yeah, basically.

02:30:57.948 --> 02:30:58.937
TALIESIN: Way to paint a tableau.

02:30:58.937 --> 02:30:59.874
MARISHA: Crying.

02:30:59.874 --> 02:31:01.307
MATT: Yeah. Crying in your pudding.

02:31:01.307 --> 02:31:03.591
MARISHA: Angry.

02:31:03.591 --> 02:31:05.960
TALIESIN: I think 'crying in your pudding' is
actually a British saying.

02:31:05.960 --> 02:31:09.442
MARISHA: Do you think that if we would've not
covered the room in pudding,

02:31:09.442 --> 02:31:12.314
that he would have stayed?

02:31:12.314 --> 02:31:14.166
LAURA: I start cleaning it up.

02:31:14.166 --> 02:31:16.435
Well, he seemed
pretty pissed that I went and got Kaylie,

02:31:16.435 --> 02:31:19.458
even though he ran away with her at the first
chance he had.

02:31:19.458 --> 02:31:25.120
MARISHA: And you had to stay in a shitty BnB,
a brothel and-- (laughs)

02:31:25.120 --> 02:31:27.872
MATT: You see that Pike is still kinda shaking her
fist in the corner right now. She doesn't say

02:31:27.872 --> 02:31:29.666
anything during this whole exchange.

02:31:29.666 --> 02:31:31.832
LIAM: Pike--

02:31:31.832 --> 02:31:33.259
LAURA: Pike, are you okay?

02:31:33.259 --> 02:31:34.366
LIAM: How you doing, Pickle?

02:31:34.366 --> 02:31:40.470
MARISHA: Oh, right, Pike. Right.

02:31:40.470 --> 02:31:45.863
MATT: He needs to do this... Right? He needs to do
this.

02:31:45.863 --> 02:31:50.650
LAURA: He says he does.

02:31:50.650 --> 02:31:53.076
MATT: What do we need to do?

02:31:53.076 --> 02:31:56.904
LAURA: I have no fucking clue.

02:31:56.904 --> 02:31:58.687
MATT: I need to get a drink.

02:31:58.687 --> 02:32:04.779
MARISHA: Yeah. We could always go back to
Vasselheim and pick up on that little drinking.

02:32:04.779 --> 02:32:06.626
LAURA: I'm not gonna go anywhere, Keyleth.

02:32:06.626 --> 02:32:08.100
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:32:08.100 --> 02:32:11.945
LIAM: I don't wanna go back to Vasselheim.

02:32:11.945 --> 02:32:16.057
MARISHA: I mean, we can drink anywhere. Vasselheim
doesn't have to be in that equation.

02:32:16.057 --> 02:32:21.458
MATT: Where else do we have to go? Away from here.
I just want to be away from here.

02:32:21.458 --> 02:32:22.379
LIAM: Pike--

02:32:22.379 --> 02:32:27.193
MARISHA: I have to go to the water ashari.
I have to.

02:32:27.193 --> 02:32:32.780
LIAM: And before too long, we have a demon who
wants you and I

02:32:32.780 --> 02:32:38.503
dead in the night. We have to deal with it.

02:32:38.503 --> 02:32:41.591
MATT: All right. Anything else?

02:32:41.591 --> 02:32:45.797
MARISHA: Pike, you know the Ozmit Sea. You've
sailed it, yeah?

02:32:45.797 --> 02:32:48.013
MATT: It's been a while, but yeah.

02:32:48.013 --> 02:32:51.218
MARISHA: We might need you for the water ashari.

02:32:51.218 --> 02:32:53.370
MATT: I can do that.

02:32:53.370 --> 02:32:56.333
MARISHA: Seems like-- I guess all of us are
picking up on

02:32:56.333 --> 02:33:06.867
our own individual paths from here? I guess.

02:33:06.867 --> 02:33:11.756
MATT: Why can't we still help each other out?

02:33:11.756 --> 02:33:15.852
LIAM: We can. Of course we can. Pike...

02:33:15.852 --> 02:33:19.788
MATT: His path is his own. He has to do his thing
alone. We don't have to be alone.

02:33:19.788 --> 02:33:28.768
LIAM: No. No, we don't. We just wanna slow things
down for a while.

02:33:28.768 --> 02:33:32.044
It's been a long couple of months.

02:33:32.044 --> 02:33:40.464
MARISHA: Is Scanlan right? Have we become too
close to each other? Do we need to all take our

02:33:40.464 --> 02:33:48.157
individual time like we've done in the past?

02:33:48.157 --> 02:33:59.650
LIAM: No, we just need to not have our lives on
the line every day. For a little while. Or ever.

02:33:59.650 --> 02:34:14.357
Retirement's not a terrible idea. I mean,
what's the takeaway here, from Scanlan? Can't

02:34:14.357 --> 02:34:26.589
hold anything in. Fuck. You know that I've always
looked up to you, for everything? That I've tried

02:34:26.589 --> 02:34:32.342
to model myself after you. Do you know that? And
you.

02:34:32.392 --> 02:34:37.872
You know that she's my best friend,
right? You know that.

02:34:37.872 --> 02:34:39.608
MARISHA: 'Course.

02:34:39.608 --> 02:34:46.130
LIAM: You know that I'm madly in love with her,
right? You know that, right? We don't need to

02:34:46.130 --> 02:34:50.437
joke about it or dance around it anymore.
You know that I'm in love with her, right?

02:34:50.437 --> 02:34:51.989
LAURA: Obviously.

02:34:51.989 --> 02:34:56.137
LIAM: Obviously.

02:34:56.137 --> 02:34:57.587
MARISHA: What are you getting at, Vax?

02:34:57.587 --> 02:35:02.997
LIAM: I just don't-- He left because he felt like
we didn't know him. I'm scared to death about what

02:35:02.997 --> 02:35:08.545
I have to give to a fucking god, eventually.
I'm scared of that. I don't want to do that,

02:35:08.545 --> 02:35:13.141
but it's going to happen, and it's destiny.
I'm scared about that. There. That's out.

02:35:13.141 --> 02:35:17.686
Do you have anything that you're holding in?
You're in love with Percival. We all know that,

02:35:17.686 --> 02:35:23.525
right? It's plain as day, right?

02:35:23.525 --> 02:35:37.843
LAURA: My take-away from Scanlan is that we all
talk too much. And I leave the room.

02:35:37.843 --> 02:35:40.929
MARISHA: And then I look at Vax and Percy,
and say--

02:35:40.929 --> 02:35:42.005
TALIESIN: &nbsp;Oh, I'm not there.

02:35:42.005 --> 02:35:42.854
MATT: Percy's not there

02:35:42.854 --> 02:35:43.800
MARISHA: Oh, sorry. Vax and--

02:35:43.800 --> 02:35:44.366
MATT: Pike.

02:35:44.366 --> 02:35:49.487
MARISHA: --Pike, and say: And my takeaway is that
maybe we were forgetting who we were before we all

02:35:49.487 --> 02:36:03.683
banded together. And then I leave the room.

02:36:03.683 --> 02:36:06.354
SAM: They're all individually going to the room
next door.

02:36:06.354 --> 02:36:07.433
(all laugh)

02:36:07.433 --> 02:36:08.681
MATT: Yeah, they're all just congregating in the
next chamber.

02:36:08.681 --> 02:36:09.954
LAURA: And that's where Scanlan's waiting.

02:36:09.954 --> 02:36:11.711
TALIESIN: It's like a Black Mirror episode

02:36:11.711 --> 02:36:14.288
SAM: Everyone's reading highlights.

02:36:14.288 --> 02:36:16.078
LIAM: Crack out the aerator, yo.

02:36:16.078 --> 02:36:18.834
TRAVIS: Highlights.

02:36:18.834 --> 02:36:20.610
LAURA: Blacklight.

02:36:20.610 --> 02:36:24.015
MARISHA: It's the basement in Westworld.
We all just go catatonic.

02:36:24.015 --> 02:36:27.764
MATT: Pike kinda walks up to you as they walk out
of the room and puts her gauntleted hand on your

02:36:27.764 --> 02:36:39.008
shoulder and just says, "We all make mistakes,
I make 'em a lot."

02:36:39.008 --> 02:36:42.394
LIAM: Yeah.

02:36:42.394 --> 02:36:49.250
MATT: You have a lot of other people to look up
to, aside from just me.

02:36:49.250 --> 02:36:56.418
LIAM: I've learned that.

02:36:56.573 --> 02:37:03.361
MATT: His path is his own. And he'll come back.
Right?

02:37:03.361 --> 02:37:15.027
LIAM: I don't know. But he's our friend.
I like having him around.

02:37:15.027 --> 02:37:27.022
MATT: Me too. (sighs) Let's get a drink.

02:37:27.022 --> 02:37:28.028
LIAM: What?

02:37:28.028 --> 02:37:31.402
MATT Let's get a drink.

02:37:31.402 --> 02:37:35.587
LIAM: Let's get a drink. You wanna go in town?

02:37:35.587 --> 02:37:36.266
MATT: Yeah.

02:37:36.266 --> 02:37:39.668
LIAM: All right.

02:37:39.668 --> 02:37:44.951
MARISHA: I chase down Vex, and we do the same
thing.

02:37:44.951 --> 02:37:51.896
MATT: You guys all individually find your way
through the rest of the afternoon to discuss,

02:37:51.896 --> 02:38:06.484
cope with and ruminate on the separation of
Scanlan. Going through all the different emotions

02:38:06.484 --> 02:38:10.095
you feel that are necessary, and whatever

02:38:10.095 --> 02:38:15.518
activities you proceed to distract yourself with.
Grog.

02:38:15.518 --> 02:38:21.671
LAURA: (laughs) Crying in a corner.

02:38:21.671 --> 02:38:22.900
LIAM: (mock-crying)

02:38:22.900 --> 02:38:26.991
TRAVIS: Crying on bosoms. (mock-crying)

02:38:26.991 --> 02:38:32.543
(all laugh)

02:38:32.543 --> 02:38:35.825
TRAVIS: I'll pay for this.

02:38:35.825 --> 02:38:38.672
MATT: Yes, you will. That's extra.

02:38:38.672 --> 02:38:43.371
(all laugh)

02:38:43.371 --> 02:38:45.376
MATT: And strangely not uncommon.

02:38:45.376 --> 02:38:48.979
LIAM: He's wrapping up the show, I can tell.
So I came to give Sam a hug.

02:38:48.979 --> 02:38:49.965
LAURA: He's not! No, he's not!

02:38:49.965 --> 02:38:51.522
MATT: He's not, actually. I don't know where you
got that idea.

02:38:51.522 --> 02:38:52.823
LIAM: Well, I was just getting in a mid-game hug.

02:38:52.823 --> 02:38:54.343
MATT: There you go! (laughs)

02:38:54.343 --> 02:38:55.389
TALIESIN: This is awkward.

02:38:55.389 --> 02:38:56.969
MATT: You guys still got shit to do.

02:38:56.969 --> 02:38:59.343
LAURA: Guys, no. Stop it.

02:38:59.343 --> 02:39:01.623
MATT: You guys made promises, you're still on a
timeline for some things.

02:39:01.623 --> 02:39:03.305
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:39:03.305 --> 02:39:05.123
MATT: You still have things to do.

02:39:05.123 --> 02:39:07.018
MARISHA: No, we know.

02:39:07.018 --> 02:39:07.828
TALIESIN: We know.

02:39:07.828 --> 02:39:10.112
LIAM: We know.

02:39:10.112 --> 02:39:14.934
MATT: Don't take that as Sam closing the curtain
here. Still got shit to do.

02:39:14.934 --> 02:39:19.093
LIAM: I know, but... I craved that, so I took it.

02:39:19.093 --> 02:39:21.588
MATT: No, that's okay. Cross-table hugs are fine.

02:39:21.588 --> 02:39:23.265
TALIESIN: That was weird.

02:39:23.265 --> 02:39:27.430
MATT: The next morning comes around, you're all in
various states of hungover; should you have chosen

02:39:27.430 --> 02:39:29.373
to imbibe with the rest of the party.

02:39:29.373 --> 02:39:30.550
LIAM: Heavily.

02:39:30.550 --> 02:39:35.402
MATT: Grog eventually wanders in, less hungover
but more meek about how his previous day was.

02:39:35.402 --> 02:39:39.895
TRAVIS: Not my best night.

02:39:39.895 --> 02:39:44.338
MARISHA: I see Vax the next morning and I say,
Look, your sister gave me one of her blue

02:39:44.338 --> 02:39:49.468
feathers. It's because this is the darkest
timeline.

02:39:49.468 --> 02:39:54.984
LAURA: I come back and I take that off. I'm like,
No, Keyleth, you took that from me when you were

02:39:54.984 --> 02:39:56.669
drunk last night, actually.

02:39:56.669 --> 02:40:00.794
MARISHA: It's because this is the darkest timeline
and I stole it from you.

02:40:00.794 --> 02:40:10.027
LIAM: Pike and I come in wearing fun buns,
hungover. My face hurts.

02:40:10.027 --> 02:40:11.247
LAURA: How is everyone?

02:40:11.247 --> 02:40:13.860
MATT: She slaps you.

02:40:13.860 --> 02:40:15.080
TRAVIS: Amazing.

02:40:15.080 --> 02:40:16.848
MATT: Does it still hurt?

02:40:16.848 --> 02:40:19.556
LIAM: Yeah, and also my face hurts as well.

02:40:19.556 --> 02:40:21.766
MATT: Good.

02:40:21.766 --> 02:40:25.239
LAURA: Percy.

02:40:25.239 --> 02:40:26.795
TALIESIN: Good morning.

02:40:26.795 --> 02:40:27.780
LAURA: Morning.

02:40:27.780 --> 02:40:29.952
MARISHA: What did you do last night?

02:40:29.952 --> 02:40:31.098
TALIESIN: Worked.

02:40:31.098 --> 02:40:33.742
MARISHA: Worked? You were productive.

02:40:33.742 --> 02:40:34.665
TALIESIN: Well...

02:40:34.665 --> 02:40:36.614
MARISHA: You made the rest of us look and feel
like shit?

02:40:36.614 --> 02:40:39.456
TALIESIN: I think we all have our ways of
coping.

02:40:39.456 --> 02:40:42.664
MARISHA: What did you make?

02:40:42.664 --> 02:40:44.101
TALIESIN: Just some sketches.

02:40:44.101 --> 02:40:47.453
MARISHA: Did you bake a cake? I hope you baked a
cake.

02:40:47.453 --> 02:40:48.540
TALIESIN: There's no cake.

02:40:48.540 --> 02:40:50.999
MARISHA: I really want coffee cake right now,
Percy.

02:40:50.999 --> 02:40:53.435
TALIESIN: There are people for that.

02:40:53.435 --> 02:40:54.716
LIAM: You look like me.

02:40:54.716 --> 02:40:56.636
LAURA: Squish-squish. Squish-squish.

02:40:56.636 --> 02:40:59.415
LIAM: You look like me. Why do you look like me?

02:40:59.415 --> 02:41:04.462
LAURA: You're still drunk. Sober up. It's a new
day.

02:41:04.462 --> 02:41:08.342
LIAM: That's boring.

02:41:08.342 --> 02:41:15.349
LAURA: (laughs) Oh, shit! He could've broken his
nose just then, I swear. Oh my god.

02:41:15.349 --> 02:41:16.657
MARISHA: Is it a new day?

02:41:16.657 --> 02:41:17.452
LAURA: It is.

02:41:17.452 --> 02:41:18.236
MATT: It is.

02:41:18.236 --> 02:41:19.590
MARISHA: I thought it was still yesterday.

02:41:19.590 --> 02:41:22.740
TALIESIN: Oh hey, I've got all my hit dice back.
That's nice.

02:41:22.796 --> 02:41:24.449
MATT: Yeah, spells are back, you guys are healed.

02:41:24.449 --> 02:41:25.722
MARISHA: My staff is charged.

02:41:25.722 --> 02:41:26.870
LAURA: You're up from nine points.

02:41:26.870 --> 02:41:27.657
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:41:27.657 --> 02:41:35.089
LAURA: Hey, wake up, fuck. Wake up. It's a new
day. Open your eyes. Hey.

02:41:35.089 --> 02:41:37.154
MATT: Pike casts Restoration on Vax.

02:41:37.154 --> 02:41:40.273
LAURA: Hey, you're not drunk anymore, look at
that.

02:41:40.273 --> 02:41:41.514
LIAM: I feel good.

02:41:41.514 --> 02:41:44.838
(all laugh)

02:41:45.041 --> 02:41:49.589
TRAVIS: All right. So, what? First step is the
most important one, right?

02:41:49.589 --> 02:41:53.224
TALIESIN: Well, as far as I know we have three
things still on our plate.

02:41:53.224 --> 02:41:55.197
MATT: Which ones?

02:41:55.197 --> 02:41:56.725
TALIESIN: We've got a hand.

02:41:56.725 --> 02:41:58.041
LIAM: Hotis.

02:41:58.041 --> 02:42:01.951
TALIESIN: We've got the ashari, and we've got a
demon.

02:42:01.951 --> 02:42:05.984
MARISHA: We also have research we have to look at
that we got from that lair of Raishan's.

02:42:05.984 --> 02:42:07.603
TRAVIS: What's the hand?

02:42:07.603 --> 02:42:13.381
LAURA: We have to give Ripley's hand to those guys
in Marquet. I think that's the easy one.

02:42:13.381 --> 02:42:14.677
LIAM: That seems like the quickest.

02:42:14.677 --> 02:42:16.057
MATT: That's definitely the quickest.

02:42:16.057 --> 02:42:17.189
TRAVIS: Let's try that.

02:42:17.189 --> 02:42:19.041
LIAM: My mental acuity's on point.

02:42:19.041 --> 02:42:23.869
MARISHA: I feel like if I teleport I'm gonna
puke.

02:42:23.869 --> 02:42:26.367
MATT: Pike grabs a bucket.

02:42:26.533 --> 02:42:27.870
(all laugh)

02:42:27.870 --> 02:42:32.695
TALIESIN: I run to the kitchen. I put together
something that is not quite, but probably a hot

02:42:32.695 --> 02:42:37.957
sauce, with half a raw egg, and shot of something
that is quite possibly

02:42:37.957 --> 02:42:41.882
but not quite some sort of
fantasy variant of tequila.

02:42:41.882 --> 02:42:43.213
MARISHA: You are not--

02:42:43.213 --> 02:42:44.193
TALIESIN: Swirl it all up.

02:42:44.193 --> 02:42:46.236
MARISHA: -- frat-boy one-shotting me this.

02:42:46.236 --> 02:42:47.759
TALIESIN: This is a thing.

02:42:47.759 --> 02:42:51.969
LIAM: That's science. Listen to Percy. That's
science, you need that and you need a traditional

02:42:51.969 --> 02:42:53.890
Whitestone breakfast.

02:42:53.890 --> 02:42:55.652
LAURA: It's super good, Keyleth, really.

02:42:55.652 --> 02:42:57.490
TALIESIN: Yeah, just get it down, just get it
down.

02:42:57.490 --> 02:42:58.508
MARISHA: Why this?

02:42:58.508 --> 02:42:59.646
TALIESIN: Don't look at it.

02:42:59.646 --> 02:43:01.478
LIAM: Just listen to the science guy and
chug-a-lug.

02:43:01.478 --> 02:43:03.917
TRAVIS: Bottoms up.

02:43:03.917 --> 02:43:06.108
TALIESIN: I was kidding. You shouldn't actually
drink that.

02:43:06.108 --> 02:43:11.472
MARISHA: Fuck you, motherfucker!

02:43:11.472 --> 02:43:12.697
TALIESIN: Can I get a roll damage?

02:43:12.697 --> 02:43:17.776
(all laugh)

02:43:17.952 --> 02:43:22.760
TALIESIN: I've done something very similar to that
on many a morning.

02:43:22.760 --> 02:43:27.291
MARISHA: We need to look at this research.
We need to figure out what Raishan had going on.

02:43:27.291 --> 02:43:30.161
LAURA: My brain hurts from crying so much
yesterday.

02:43:30.161 --> 02:43:32.158
MARISHA: I know. Are my eyes puffy?

02:43:32.158 --> 02:43:32.766
TALIESIN: Yes.

02:43:32.766 --> 02:43:34.377
MARISHA: Do I have bags under my-- thank you.

02:43:34.377 --> 02:43:35.498
TALIESIN: You're welcome.

02:43:35.498 --> 02:43:36.993
LIAM: You wear it well.

02:43:36.993 --> 02:43:39.701
MATT: So what's the plan. What's up first?

02:43:39.701 --> 02:43:42.811
TALIESIN: Let's take a quick look at what we got
from the cave.

02:43:42.811 --> 02:43:45.158
LAURA: Maybe bring Allura and Gilmore in here,
because

02:43:45.158 --> 02:43:48.517
we have that book that seemed very
nefarious.

02:43:48.517 --> 02:43:50.839
MARISHA: I help Percy figure things out.

02:43:50.839 --> 02:43:57.495
MATT: Okay. From the things that you gathered
off, a lot of them were candle-holders, there were

02:43:57.495 --> 02:44:06.938
various reagents, some of them rotted or dried
out, a number of books and tomes, some that deal

02:44:07.009 --> 02:44:11.383
with poisons, various alchemy. Actually, a similar
book to the one that you found earlier in your

02:44:11.383 --> 02:44:20.934
travels, but an older version of it. And there is
the one large tome that you acquired that had the

02:44:20.934 --> 02:44:25.556
more nefarious-looking leather-bound exterior,
the thicker piece.

02:44:25.556 --> 02:44:26.760
TRAVIS: I'll read this.

02:44:26.760 --> 02:44:31.987
LAURA: No, don't touch it, Grog, I don't trust it.
I want Allura or Gilmore to look at it first.

02:44:31.987 --> 02:44:38.300
MATT: The easiest person to find here would
probably be Allura, in the castle. Well, no,

02:44:38.300 --> 02:44:42.812
because Allura's off in Emon helping with the
destruction. Gilmore would be the only one you

02:44:42.812 --> 02:44:44.241
could really speak to currently.

02:44:44.241 --> 02:44:45.435
LAURA: Or Eskil.

02:44:45.435 --> 02:44:50.766
MATT: Or Eskil. But he's a little wary of you at
the moment. (laughs)

02:44:50.766 --> 02:44:55.447
LAURA: I just keep making people wary of me.

02:44:55.447 --> 02:44:57.974
MATT: All right, so you go ahead and you bring
Gilmore in?

02:44:57.974 --> 02:44:59.951
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:44:59.951 --> 02:45:04.058
MATT: Okay. And it's easy enough to bring in.
He's just waking up. (yawns)

02:45:04.058 --> 02:45:07.884
"So, what can I help you with?"

02:45:07.884 --> 02:45:09.040
LAURA: Hi.

02:45:09.040 --> 02:45:15.683
TALIESIN: We found this. Be careful, it was with
Raishan.

02:45:15.683 --> 02:45:21.707
MATT: He takes it, he sits down and places it on
his lap, and tugs on his braided goatee.

02:45:21.707 --> 02:45:25.598
"This smells like shit."

02:45:25.598 --> 02:45:29.512
TALIESIN: Several things have died on top of it.

02:45:29.512 --> 02:45:32.012
LIAM: I give my armor a sniff.

02:45:32.012 --> 02:45:39.723
MATT: Smells-- different kind of shit, but shit
nonetheless. He takes a look over it.

02:45:39.723 --> 02:45:50.357
"This has a very faint magical essence to it. 
Let me go ahead and--"

02:45:50.406 --> 02:45:54.036
He looks over it for a second, his eyes glow with
that same

02:45:54.036 --> 02:46:03.222
arcane purplish energy that flares when he does 
the Identify spell. Looks over it.

02:46:03.222 --> 02:46:16.203
"This is an evil book. Reading this would be
informative, but would certainly have a cost."

02:46:16.203 --> 02:46:19.561
TRAVIS: Like, money?

02:46:19.561 --> 02:46:21.385
MATT: Soul-money.

02:46:21.385 --> 02:46:22.567
LAURA: Soul-money.

02:46:22.567 --> 02:46:24.321
TRAVIS: Do we have any of that in the bag of
holding?

02:46:24.321 --> 02:46:27.474
LAURA: I don't think we do. Not anymore.

02:46:27.474 --> 02:46:29.469
MATT: Wouldn't recommend it, Grog.

02:46:29.469 --> 02:46:31.941
TALIESIN: What do you recommend we do with this
book?

02:46:31.941 --> 02:46:37.531
MATT: Well, if you ever feel like you want some
light reading. Or find somebody who's foolish

02:46:37.531 --> 02:46:42.159
enough to read it. Or at least has the willpower
to push through

02:46:42.159 --> 02:46:44.408
its dark enchantments. I have no idea.

02:46:44.408 --> 02:46:45.424
TRAVIS: Oh, shit.

02:46:45.424 --> 02:46:48.878
LAURA: Let's just keep that in a--

02:46:48.878 --> 02:46:50.185
TALIESIN: Going to vault that for the moment.

02:46:50.185 --> 02:46:51.029
LAURA: Yeah.

02:46:51.029 --> 02:46:52.929
TRAVIS: You're saying somebody could read it,
but they'd

02:46:52.929 --> 02:46:56.150
have to make it all the way through the end.

02:46:56.150 --> 02:47:01.636
MATT: I don't want to look into it, I'll put it
that way. But somebody with a strong enough mental

02:47:01.636 --> 02:47:08.072
aptitude to be able to not be corrupted by its
dark magics.

02:47:08.072 --> 02:47:10.891
It's my recommendation at the very least.

02:47:10.891 --> 02:47:12.541
TALIESIN: Not anyone in this room, is what he's
saying.

02:47:12.541 --> 02:47:16.777
TRAVIS: Right. What else have we got?

02:47:16.777 --> 02:47:21.455
TALIESIN: I say hand. It's simple, to the point.

02:47:21.455 --> 02:47:22.530
LAURA: I agree.

02:47:22.530 --> 02:47:23.901
LIAM: I agree. One and done.

02:47:23.901 --> 02:47:27.029
TALIESIN: And we can find the ashari on the way
back.

02:47:27.029 --> 02:47:28.023
MARISHA: Yeah, we can.

02:47:28.023 --> 02:47:31.965
TRAVIS: All right.

02:47:31.965 --> 02:47:34.650
LAURA: This feels wrong.

02:47:34.650 --> 02:47:36.843
TRAVIS: It feels different.

02:47:36.843 --> 02:47:39.012
LIAM: Ah, it feels wrong.

02:47:39.012 --> 02:47:41.222
MARISHA: That's not on us, though, it's on him.

02:47:41.222 --> 02:47:42.983
LAURA: Can you scry?

02:47:42.983 --> 02:47:43.823
MARISHA: Me?

02:47:43.823 --> 02:47:46.880
LAURA: Yeah. See where he is, what he's doing.

02:47:46.880 --> 02:47:53.129
MARISHA: I pull out the scrying eye. Can I hold it
out in front--

02:47:53.129 --> 02:47:58.167
this is kind of flavor-- and I let it
levitate in front.

02:47:58.221 --> 02:48:01.524
MATT: It locks itself in place and slowly
rotates.

02:48:01.524 --> 02:48:11.054
MARISHA: Can I open it like a fortune-teller's
spying sphere type of crystal--

02:48:11.054 --> 02:48:14.879
LAURA: And just like project it on the wall behind
her so we can watch it like that movie.

02:48:14.879 --> 02:48:17.130
MATT: The vision comes to you. It doesn't quite do
that.

02:48:17.130 --> 02:48:18.629
MARISHA: That would be really awesome.

02:48:18.629 --> 02:48:21.677
TRAVIS: Can I make it Imax?

02:48:21.677 --> 02:48:24.371
MATT: I want that HD download, not the SD.

02:48:24.371 --> 02:48:26.076
MARISHA: 5.1 Dolby digital surround.

02:48:26.076 --> 02:48:29.404
LIAM: Whoa, it's all around me!

02:48:29.404 --> 02:48:33.891
MARISHA: Oh my god, so many lagging issues.

02:48:33.891 --> 02:48:37.366
TRAVIS: What's he rolling for?

02:48:37.366 --> 02:48:38.628
LAURA: To see if he senses it, maybe.

02:48:38.628 --> 02:48:39.899
LIAM: You don't know.

02:48:39.899 --> 02:48:41.483
MATT: So what's your wisdom modifier?

02:48:41.483 --> 02:48:42.233
SAM: Me?

02:48:42.233 --> 02:48:43.885
MATT: Your wisdom saving throw.

02:48:43.885 --> 02:48:46.687
SAM: Negative two.

02:48:46.687 --> 02:48:49.064
LAURA: Wait, what did you roll?

02:48:49.064 --> 02:48:50.694
MATT: What'd you roll?

02:48:50.694 --> 02:48:55.502
SAM: I got a two total. But I get advantage
against magic.

02:48:55.502 --> 02:48:58.264
MATT: You do.

02:48:58.264 --> 02:48:59.609
SAM: That's a 17.

02:48:59.609 --> 02:49:04.348
MATT: Plus your-- what's your wisdom saving throw
bonus?

02:49:04.348 --> 02:49:07.192
SAM: I mean, that's 19, my wisdom is negative
two.

02:49:07.192 --> 02:49:10.793
MATT: Oh, minus two. Got you. And your spell DC
is--

02:49:10.793 --> 02:49:13.203
MARISHA: Oh, I'm spying on those bitches.

02:49:13.203 --> 02:49:20.878
MATT: Okay, so. You get a brief view of what looks
to be Scanlan,

02:49:20.878 --> 02:49:24.381
wearing his regular outfit and armor now.

02:49:24.381 --> 02:49:25.989
MARISHA: He took his armor off? He's just regular
clothes?

02:49:25.989 --> 02:49:27.622
LAURA: No, he walked out in a fucking nightgown.

02:49:27.622 --> 02:49:28.665
MATT: He walked out in a nightgown.

02:49:28.665 --> 02:49:29.812
MARISHA: Oh, right, yeah.

02:49:29.812 --> 02:49:35.958
MATT: Through this whole emotional circumstance,
he was in a nightgown. But he is currently,

02:49:35.958 --> 02:49:41.888
he's walking through the Parchwood Forest that
surrounds Whitestone. He is on the path south.

02:49:41.888 --> 02:49:43.271
MARISHA: South of Whitestone?

02:49:43.271 --> 02:49:48.489
MATT: Yeah. South of Whitestone. To his left is
Kaylie, and they're both with their sacks over

02:49:48.489 --> 02:49:55.427
their shoulders, and they're just hiking through
the forest. They're, at the moment, not talking,

02:49:55.427 --> 02:50:07.336
but they're both slightly smiling. Just kind of
enjoying the journey, and the company. And you

02:50:07.336 --> 02:50:14.013
just watch them walk for a little bit through the
thick tree canopy above, the well-worn path that

02:50:14.013 --> 02:50:18.902
heads south and out of the Parchwood.

02:50:18.902 --> 02:50:24.797
MARISHA: He looks content. Happy, even.

02:50:24.797 --> 02:50:26.147
LAURA: That's good.

02:50:26.147 --> 02:50:31.037
LIAM: Yeah, good on him.

02:50:31.037 --> 02:50:32.481
TRAVIS: Can you yell at him?

02:50:32.481 --> 02:50:35.377
MARISHA: I feel like he's like flicking off a
bunch of trees now.

02:50:35.377 --> 02:50:38.692
I don't know. He was always an odd one.

02:50:38.741 --> 02:50:40.813
LIAM: To be fair, he did that about seven times a
day.

02:50:40.813 --> 02:50:41.673
(all laugh)

02:50:41.673 --> 02:50:42.641
MARISHA: He did, yeah.

02:50:42.641 --> 02:50:43.597
LIAM: For no reason.

02:50:43.597 --> 02:50:44.949
MARISHA: I never knew his animosity toward trees.

02:50:44.949 --> 02:50:45.592
MATT: You never know.

02:50:45.592 --> 02:50:46.301
SAM: Just in case.

02:50:46.301 --> 02:50:47.742
MARISHA: I don't know.

02:50:47.792 --> 02:50:49.357
(all laugh)

02:50:49.357 --> 02:50:50.213
LIAM and LAURA: Just in case.

02:50:50.213 --> 02:50:51.708
MARISHA: Just really hates oaks.

02:50:51.708 --> 02:50:58.502
LIAM: Raven Queen, demons, you never know who's
looking over your shoulder.

02:50:58.502 --> 02:51:02.128
LAURA: We should've invited Kaylie to come with
us. They could've stayed--

02:51:02.175 --> 02:51:03.706
LIAM: They don't want that.

02:51:03.706 --> 02:51:14.245
MARISHA: I have a feeling there's little chance we
could talk him out of it. Well! All right.

02:51:14.245 --> 02:51:22.050
He's living a nice, happy, content, low-key life
now. Let's continue on.

02:51:22.050 --> 02:51:23.720
LIAM: Yeah, and why shouldn't he, he earned it.

02:51:23.720 --> 02:51:24.258
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:51:24.258 --> 02:51:24.987
MARISHA: Yeah, he did

02:51:24.987 --> 02:51:26.825
LIAM: He earned it.

02:51:26.825 --> 02:51:29.061
TRAVIS: (quietly) Dick. (louder) Sorry, what?

02:51:29.061 --> 02:51:29.935
LAURA: Yeah, right.

02:51:29.935 --> 02:51:32.212
MARISHA: He saved the world, what more could we
ask of anybody?

02:51:32.281 --> 02:51:36.974
TRAVIS: Let's go. What clears the brain better
than travel? (sniffs) Or sex.

02:51:36.974 --> 02:51:45.152
LIAM: Wait, stop, stop. I was about to say you
sounded very wise, don't fuck it up. Just, period.

02:51:45.218 --> 02:51:46.269
TRAVIS: Period.

02:51:46.269 --> 02:51:47.651
LIAM: Travel and sex. Done.

02:51:47.651 --> 02:51:53.894
MARISHA: You know, there's merit to that.
All right, let's go.

02:51:53.894 --> 02:52:02.244
LAURA: As we head to the tree, I pull Grog aside,
and I ask him: Are you all right, Grog? I mean,

02:52:02.251 --> 02:52:08.181
I know, I know you got your lady favors out of
the way and all that, but... Scanlan was your

02:52:08.181 --> 02:52:12.812
bestie, right? Outside of Pike.

02:52:12.812 --> 02:52:18.266
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'm just bummed, because I'm glad
he's alive--

02:52:18.266 --> 02:52:19.120
LAURA: Well, yeah.

02:52:19.120 --> 02:52:22.667
TRAVIS: I think that's what keeps us from being
terrible. But like-- (sniffs) I only trust like a

02:52:22.667 --> 02:52:30.923
few people in the world. You, Scanlan, and Pike.
And now it's just you and Pike.

02:52:30.923 --> 02:52:32.000
LAURA: Me and Pike?

02:52:32.000 --> 02:52:38.019
TRAVIS: No, I mean I trust the others, right,
but like... I know you on a more intimate level.

02:52:38.019 --> 02:52:39.322
LAURA: Cause you saw my titties?

02:52:39.322 --> 02:52:40.093
TRAVIS: Pretty much.

02:52:40.093 --> 02:52:41.107
LAURA: Yeah.

02:52:41.107 --> 02:52:42.521
TRAVIS: Yeah. Um.

02:52:42.521 --> 02:52:46.518
MARISHA: That's literally it. I don't know if
they've ever had, like, an in depth conversation.

02:52:46.518 --> 02:52:47.831
(all laugh)

02:52:47.831 --> 02:52:48.647
TRAVIS: So.

02:52:48.647 --> 02:52:51.155
LAURA: Right.

02:52:51.155 --> 02:52:58.773
TRAVIS: That's all. I just-- I just feel a little
more sad on the inside. But I'm all right.

02:52:58.930 --> 02:53:00.172
LAURA: I'm sorry, Grog.

02:53:00.172 --> 02:53:01.847
TRAVIS: Yeah. I'm glad he's okay.

02:53:01.847 --> 02:53:02.558
LAURA: Me too.

02:53:02.558 --> 02:53:04.175
MARISHA: Show him your titties again.

02:53:04.175 --> 02:53:07.156
LAURA: Do you want to see them? Would that make
you feel better?

02:53:07.156 --> 02:53:08.470
TRAVIS: No, it's not right, right now.

02:53:08.470 --> 02:53:11.196
LAURA: Yeah, no, it didn't feel right, I just
wanted to... all right.

02:53:11.196 --> 02:53:14.232
TRAVIS: Yeah, you know. It's... mmm. You know.

02:53:14.232 --> 02:53:18.028
(all laugh)

02:53:18.028 --> 02:53:19.241
TRAVIS: I appreciate the offer.

02:53:19.288 --> 02:53:25.568
MATT: As you walk your way down to the center of
Whitestone, to the Sun Tree--

02:53:25.568 --> 02:53:27.431
LIAM: It's so touching and ridiculous at the same
time.

02:53:27.431 --> 02:53:37.224
MATT: I know. You recall that in the center of the
city itself, Ank'harel, as it acts as one of the

02:53:37.224 --> 02:53:44.041
largest oases in the center of the central Marquet
desert, there are a number of larger trees of

02:53:44.041 --> 02:53:49.276
various types, and there's one not too far from
the Suncut Bazaar, that you recall. You make that

02:53:49.276 --> 02:53:54.578
your designated tree, and upon casting the spell,
you watch the Sun Tree, tear open the doorway,

02:53:54.578 --> 02:53:55.829
and you step across--

02:53:55.880 --> 02:54:01.101
MARISHA: As I cast the spell, I just say, Hey,
Sun Tree? Watch over Scanlan and Kaylie,

02:54:01.171 --> 02:54:04.550
okay? And then go though.

02:54:04.550 --> 02:54:15.872
MATT: You step through. Okay. You all emerge on
the outskirts of the Suncut Bazaar. At this point

02:54:15.872 --> 02:54:25.168
in time, it would be the beginning of-- just past
dusk. The sun has gone down in Ank'harel.

02:54:25.222 --> 02:54:31.330
But you can still see the oranges and reds and
purples of the recent sunset in the distance.

02:54:31.330 --> 02:54:36.224
The city is bustling. Lanterns are alight all
throughout. The bazaar itself and all the various

02:54:36.224 --> 02:54:41.887
multicolored towers and structures and buildings,
the beautiful city just stretch up in all

02:54:41.948 --> 02:54:46.827
directions around you. You can see the bazaar
itself is lively with carts that are open,

02:54:46.955 --> 02:54:54.603
shouting as various barkers are peddling their
wares. It's a very upbeat atmosphere, and one

02:54:54.603 --> 02:54:58.200
that's a stark change to the Whitestone you just
stepped away from.

02:54:58.357 --> 02:54:59.592
LIAM: And the sun is going down, you said?

02:54:59.592 --> 02:55:00.801
MATT: The sun has already gone down.

02:55:00.801 --> 02:55:01.957
LIAM: After we just woke up.

02:55:01.957 --> 02:55:02.702
MATT: Yes.

02:55:02.874 --> 02:55:03.592
LIAM: Jet lag.

02:55:03.638 --> 02:55:04.760
LAURA: We fucked up.

02:55:04.760 --> 02:55:06.935
MATT: Yeah. Other part of the world.

02:55:06.935 --> 02:55:07.763
TALIESIN: Jet lag.

02:55:07.763 --> 02:55:08.807
LIAM: Yeah. What?

02:55:08.807 --> 02:55:09.970
TALIESIN: Tree lag.

02:55:09.970 --> 02:55:10.706
MARISHA: Tree lag.

02:55:10.706 --> 02:55:11.415
LIAM: It's a bitch.

02:55:11.415 --> 02:55:12.283
MATT: (laughs) Tree lag.

02:55:12.283 --> 02:55:14.308
MARISHA: It's the worst.

02:55:14.308 --> 02:55:19.869
MATT: You guys begin making your way toward 
the Debt's Respite, which is the tavern

02:55:19.869 --> 02:55:23.818
that housed the Scarbearers. This is where Treev 
Bonebreaker was when

02:55:23.975 --> 02:55:27.268
you last discussed the return of Ripley's
hand--

02:55:27.268 --> 02:55:28.064
LAURA: Right.

02:55:28.064 --> 02:55:33.351
MATT: -- as the assassin that killed one of their
own. And you're returning this hand to absolve

02:55:33.351 --> 02:55:36.144
yourselves of implication in this murder.

02:55:36.144 --> 02:55:36.898
MARISHA: Yes.

02:55:36.898 --> 02:55:38.231
MATT: Since you discovered the body.

02:55:38.231 --> 02:55:42.137
TALIESIN: I'm, for the record, not wearing the
cloak when we do this.

02:55:42.137 --> 02:55:43.200
MATT: Okay.

02:55:43.200 --> 02:55:45.064
LAURA and MARISHA: Hey!

02:55:45.064 --> 02:55:46.029
MATT: Good point!

02:55:46.029 --> 02:55:49.925
TALIESIN: And just for the record, I know I'll get
yelled at for twitter on this. I have informed my

02:55:49.925 --> 02:55:54.898
sister where I'm going and what's going on.
Not just going willy-nilly.

02:55:54.898 --> 02:56:05.911
MATT: Right, right, Cassandra is aware. All right.
You guys walk through, you catch a few eyes as

02:56:05.911 --> 02:56:09.927
you are not just outsiders walking through
Ank'harel,

02:56:09.927 --> 02:56:15.750
but you're all adorned in, you know,
beautiful artifact armor--

02:56:15.750 --> 02:56:16.995
LAURA: Right, we didn't put on our--

02:56:16.995 --> 02:56:18.033
MATT: Magical weapons--

02:56:18.033 --> 02:56:18.927
LIAM: God wear.

02:56:18.927 --> 02:56:25.347
MATT: God wear, essentially. And as you walk
toward the Debt's Respite tavern, on the

02:56:25.361 --> 02:56:35.784
outside you can see, there's what looks to be an
eight-and-a-half-foot tall, humanoid, golem-like

02:56:35.832 --> 02:56:42.835
metallic construct. It looks similar to a golem,
but it's smaller. Like the iron golems you've

02:56:42.835 --> 02:56:44.658
fought before, but it's smaller in scale.

02:56:44.658 --> 02:56:47.111
LIAM: Like the one we fought in J'mon's.

02:56:47.111 --> 02:56:55.356
MATT: Yeah, J'mon's, but much smaller. It's less
bulky, and more just a functional, tall,

02:56:55.356 --> 02:57:00.454
metallic humanoid-type construct.

02:57:00.454 --> 02:57:01.607
LIAM: Protocol droid.

02:57:01.607 --> 02:57:02.698
MATT: Yeah. You see it's clutching--

02:57:02.698 --> 02:57:04.904
MARISHA: (gasps) It's basically the Vision?

02:57:05.064 --> 02:57:07.280
MATT: A little more ramshackle in construct.

02:57:07.280 --> 02:57:09.030
MARISHA: Ah, okay.

02:57:09.030 --> 02:57:13.136
MATT: It's clutching a leather tome in one hand
that is open, and is holding what looks to be a

02:57:13.136 --> 02:57:19.899
quill in the other, and it's just standing there
quietly. To the front of it you see, almost

02:57:19.899 --> 02:57:25.754
waiting outside the tavern in the process of
thumbing through some satchels, you see a handsome

02:57:25.754 --> 02:57:36.334
human male. Late 30s or so, with shoulder length,
feathered, dirty blond hair and blue-green eyes,

02:57:36.334 --> 02:57:41.762
a well groomed goatee adorning his dashing smirk
as he turns and looks across you and very quickly

02:57:41.762 --> 02:57:51.233
the eyes very overtly take in and categorize your
decor, your dress, your stature. And the smile

02:57:51.233 --> 02:57:57.849
grows even wider. His frame is svelte, he's
adorned a set of polished, immaculate breastplate

02:57:57.849 --> 02:58:03.291
armor with numerous satchels all around him,
and he carries a silver helmet under his arm that

02:58:03.291 --> 02:58:09.629
shines with many, many embedded gems: diamonds,
opals. Just an opulent-looking figure who's

02:58:09.629 --> 02:58:18.271
wearing what looks to be barely used, or at least
very well-kept armor and jewelry and adornments.

02:58:18.271 --> 02:58:21.206
Immediately catches their attention.

02:58:21.206 --> 02:58:22.204
SAM: You there!

02:58:22.204 --> 02:58:23.216
LAURA: (gasps)

02:58:23.216 --> 02:58:33.205
SAM: You lot! Hello! Wow! Who are you all? Look at
this, magical items from head to toe. Why,

02:58:33.205 --> 02:58:35.648
I've never seen anything quite like it.

02:58:35.648 --> 02:58:38.136
LIAM: Pouring it on a little thick, friend.
What's up?

02:58:38.290 --> 02:58:40.320
SAM: Doty, come here, will you? Take this down.

02:58:40.320 --> 02:58:45.140
MATT: (stomping and creaking sounds) And you watch
as the giant construct takes a few steps forward

02:58:45.140 --> 02:58:48.297
and begins writing into the book.

02:58:48.297 --> 02:58:49.425
SAM: In my travels through--

02:58:49.425 --> 02:58:54.993
LAURA: Fuck! It's a kleenex, it doesn't work! You
piece of shit!

02:58:54.993 --> 02:58:57.345
LIAM: God dammit.

02:58:57.345 --> 02:58:59.951
MARISHA: That couldn't have been more uncanny!

02:58:59.951 --> 02:59:05.042
LAURA: Fuck! I didn't want to throw something hard
at him.

02:59:05.042 --> 02:59:06.943
MARISHA: Hoooly shit.

02:59:06.943 --> 02:59:09.841
LIAM: Fucking. Hell. (bangs table)

02:59:09.841 --> 02:59:15.189
SAM: Doty. Doty, take this down: In my travels in
Anh'karel, I have never seen so many magical items

02:59:15.189 --> 02:59:22.089
in one place. But then I saw them, walking up to
me, and I knew I had met some very special people.

02:59:22.089 --> 02:59:28.553
That's it for now. Hello! Nice to meet
you all. The name is Taryon Darrington.

02:59:28.619 --> 02:59:31.203
(all laugh)

02:59:31.203 --> 02:59:35.313
MARISHA: Darrien Darriton?

02:59:35.313 --> 02:59:37.404
Sam: Tary-ann-- Taryon Darrington.

02:59:37.404 --> 02:59:38.569
MARISHA: Darrington.

02:59:38.569 --> 02:59:45.315
SAM: My friends just call me Tary. And I'm a bit
of an adventurer. I've been traveling around this

02:59:45.315 --> 02:59:52.061
continent for a while, trying to tick off things
off of my list, and I've had a few scraps and

02:59:52.219 --> 02:59:58.628
scrapes. And I'm looking for more adventure.
I was travelling with a band of ne'er do wells

02:59:58.628 --> 03:00:04.255
that I had hired and, well, let's just say many of
them were killed. Heh. SO. I was looking to employ

03:00:04.255 --> 03:00:10.539
a ragtag group of people, elves, whatever you
are.

03:00:11.018 --> 03:00:14.364
To accompany me, sort of be my side men,
if you will.

03:00:14.364 --> 03:00:15.247
LAURA: (disgruntled) Oh.

03:00:15.247 --> 03:00:17.721
SAM: How much would a band like you cost for a
day?

03:00:17.721 --> 03:00:19.172
LAURA: 50,000 gold.

03:00:19.172 --> 03:00:21.843
SAM: Oh. That's nothing. Would you--

03:00:21.843 --> 03:00:23.762
TRAVIS: An hour.

03:00:23.996 --> 03:00:25.594
SAM: I'm sorry?

03:00:25.594 --> 03:00:26.528
LAURA: 50,000 gold an hour.

03:00:26.528 --> 03:00:27.454
MARISHA: It's like our retainer fee.

03:00:27.454 --> 03:00:28.552
LAURA: (quietly) Good thinking, Grog.

03:00:28.552 --> 03:00:33.924
SAM: Well, I tend to employ people on a
month-by-month basis, and you get a cut of the

03:00:33.924 --> 03:00:41.168
treasure as we go, of course. We can work out the
particulars, but are you in fact, guns and-- or,

03:00:41.168 --> 03:00:43.019
not guns. Swords-for-hire?

03:00:43.019 --> 03:00:45.285
TRAVIS: What, are you going after treasure?

03:00:45.285 --> 03:00:49.751
SAM: I'm going after many things. I have a long
list of things I want to tick off.

03:00:49.819 --> 03:00:51.608
TRAVIS: Are you famous?

03:00:51.608 --> 03:00:57.120
SAM: Of course I am. You haven't heard of...
Well, you haven't heard of me yet because my book

03:00:57.120 --> 03:01:01.669
hasn't come out yet. Doty here is recording my
legendary

03:01:01.669 --> 03:01:04.610
adventures as I travel around the continents.

03:01:04.610 --> 03:01:06.315
TRAVIS: How thick is the book?

03:01:06.315 --> 03:01:10.412
MATT: It's pretty thick. Make a perception check.

03:01:10.412 --> 03:01:11.121
TRAVIS: (surprised) Oh.

03:01:11.121 --> 03:01:12.448
LAURA: Wow.

03:01:12.448 --> 03:01:13.349
TRAVIS: 18!

03:01:13.349 --> 03:01:22.397
MATT: Okay. It's a pretty thick book, but it looks
like Doty is maybe a third into it. A fourth.

03:01:22.397 --> 03:01:25.574
TRAVIS: Lots of scribbles in that book.

03:01:25.574 --> 03:01:34.654
SAM: Yes, I haven't settled on a title yet.
It will either be-- "Tary's Adventures". It's sort

03:01:34.654 --> 03:01:41.404
of lame, sort of lame. Or it could be "Daring
Adventures of Darrington" or it could be "Tarry On

03:01:41.404 --> 03:01:46.519
with Taryon". Or something like that, I'm working
on the title, I have a while to finish it.

03:01:46.572 --> 03:01:47.835
LAURA: (sarcastic) They're all very clever.

03:01:47.835 --> 03:01:50.326
TALIESIN: The Daring Trial and Tribulations of
Tary Darrington.

03:01:50.326 --> 03:01:52.653
SAM: That's fantastic! Doty, please write that
down.

03:01:52.653 --> 03:01:54.655
MATT: (creaks and squeaks)

03:01:54.655 --> 03:01:57.875
SAM: I knew you were special when I ran into you
all, my goodness.

03:01:57.875 --> 03:02:00.479
LIAM: Hey, buddy boy, we have to go to the Nine
Hells

03:02:00.479 --> 03:02:03.983
in the not too distant future, are you down
for that?

03:02:03.983 --> 03:02:12.016
SAM: Well. &nbsp;Hold on, let me check my list....
that is on the list. It was... lower down, but,

03:02:12.016 --> 03:02:17.893
it's another thing I have to tick off before I'm
a real adventurer!

03:02:17.893 --> 03:02:20.682
So, I'm up for anything if you are.

03:02:20.682 --> 03:02:23.427
LIAM: Hm. I do not like you.

03:02:23.427 --> 03:02:26.722
MARISHA: This fucking asshole, am I right? This
fucking asshole.

03:02:26.722 --> 03:02:29.062
TRAVIS: Can I insight check Asshole?

03:02:29.062 --> 03:02:31.435
MATT: Yes, you may.

03:02:31.435 --> 03:02:33.290
LIAM: Look at this willing accomplice
motherfucker!

03:02:33.290 --> 03:02:34.375
MARISHA: I know!

03:02:34.375 --> 03:02:35.607
LAURA: You piece of shit, both of you.

03:02:35.607 --> 03:02:36.709
MARISHA: You're all pieces of shit.

03:02:36.709 --> 03:02:38.363
LAURA: I'm so angry at everything right now.

03:02:38.363 --> 03:02:39.659
TRAVIS: Is it perception or what on that?

03:02:39.659 --> 03:02:40.449
MATT: Insight.

03:02:40.449 --> 03:02:44.447
TALIESIN: It feels weird. New dad is wearing old
dad's skin,

03:02:44.447 --> 03:02:46.583
and trying to do an impression of him and--

03:02:46.583 --> 03:02:50.351
MARISHA: (yelling) I don't like change!

03:02:50.404 --> 03:02:53.112
LIAM: Who cares about the whisper, what's going 
on, Sam?

03:02:53.112 --> 03:02:54.069
MARISHA: Bullshit.

03:02:54.069 --> 03:02:57.336
TALIESIN: Tell us about the LootCrate, Sam! Tell
us about the LootCrate.

03:02:57.336 --> 03:03:03.357
LAURA: How dare you, Samuel? (gasps) He has a new
character sheet. I'm going to cry, again.

03:03:03.357 --> 03:03:05.237
TALIESIN: Ah! Mother lied. Ah.

03:03:05.237 --> 03:03:07.533
LAURA: I'm going to cry again. Nope. I hate Tary.
He's a dick.

03:03:07.533 --> 03:03:08.721
TRAVIS: We are actually--

03:03:08.721 --> 03:03:10.285
MARISHA: You're going to make Laura cry.
Look what you've done.

03:03:10.285 --> 03:03:11.778
TRAVIS: We are currently under--

03:03:11.778 --> 03:03:13.165
TALIESIN: Dick.

03:03:13.165 --> 03:03:16.566
MARISHA: (yelling) Fuck you, Ryan Green! Fuck
you!

03:03:16.566 --> 03:03:18.725
LIAM: This show is breaking apart because of you,
Sam!

03:03:18.725 --> 03:03:21.409
MARISHA: You were part of this too!

03:03:21.409 --> 03:03:24.773
LIAM: Show me on the character sheet where the bad
DM touched you.

03:03:24.773 --> 03:03:27.983
MATT: So, bringing it back to current conversation
at hand.

03:03:27.983 --> 03:03:34.280
TRAVIS: We are currently employed right now.
We're on a very, very dangerous mission.

03:03:34.280 --> 03:03:35.709
LAURA: A super important mission.

03:03:35.709 --> 03:03:45.807
TRAVIS: However, it ends here. So, if you have the
coin, and maybe if you prove yourself not to be

03:03:45.807 --> 03:03:49.732
too much of a lag-behind.

03:03:49.732 --> 03:03:51.019
Percy, what do you feel like--

03:03:51.019 --> 03:03:56.072
TALIESIN: I'm just saying, look, it's not like we
don't have business right now. You seem...

03:03:56.072 --> 03:03:57.448
what does he seem like?

03:03:57.448 --> 03:03:59.417
MARISHA: Yeah, what do you do, Tary?

03:03:59.417 --> 03:04:00.837
SAM: I'm an adventurer!

03:04:00.837 --> 03:04:02.602
TRAVIS: He's an adventurer.

03:04:02.602 --> 03:04:03.610
(all laugh)

03:04:03.610 --> 03:04:05.805
TALIESIN: You seem like a person, and that's
great.

03:04:05.805 --> 03:04:07.382
TRAVIS: Like Kenneth Branagh in Harry Potter.

03:04:07.382 --> 03:04:09.812
LIAM: He seems like a prat.

03:04:09.812 --> 03:04:12.176
TALIESIN: I'm trying not to judge at the moment,
and--

03:04:12.176 --> 03:04:13.380
LIAM: That's what you do.

03:04:13.380 --> 03:04:15.130
TALIESIN: I know. I've had a bad day.

03:04:15.130 --> 03:04:16.099
MARISHA: We trust you to judge.

03:04:16.099 --> 03:04:17.554
TRAVIS: What does he do?

03:04:17.554 --> 03:04:19.617
SAM: That's my biographer, Doty.

03:04:19.617 --> 03:04:22.100
TRAVIS: Does he just write stuff?

03:04:22.100 --> 03:04:25.474
SAM: If I tell him to. He also has other skills.

03:04:25.474 --> 03:04:27.402
LAURA: What does he have?

03:04:27.402 --> 03:04:31.459
SAM: Many things. I can grant powers to many
people.

03:04:31.459 --> 03:04:34.819
For instance: you, Little Elf Girl, 
what's your name?

03:04:34.819 --> 03:04:37.777
TRAVIS: (laughs) (quietly) I'm gonna move over
here.

03:04:37.777 --> 03:04:44.308
MARISHA: Hell no. Oh-ho-ho-ho.

03:04:44.308 --> 03:04:46.942
TALIESIN: I take it back, I like him.

03:04:46.942 --> 03:04:48.309
LIAM: Wait, I'm stealthing.

03:04:48.309 --> 03:04:53.876
MATT: Flames on the side of my face. Fire.
Heaving breaths.

03:04:53.876 --> 03:04:56.836
MARISHA: Keyleth uses a fog cantrip and just fades
into the alleyway.

03:04:56.836 --> 03:04:59.809
LIAM: I rolled a 33 on stealth, I'm gone!

03:04:59.809 --> 03:05:03.290
TALIESIN: And I just hex into the shadows.

03:05:03.290 --> 03:05:07.517
MARISHA: It's like we're in a Western when they
cut back to the tavern and everyone's gone.

03:05:07.517 --> 03:05:08.771
MATT: Basically.

03:05:08.771 --> 03:05:12.691
LAURA: I walk up to him. What kind of adventurer
are you

03:05:12.691 --> 03:05:17.368
if you've never heard of Vox fucking
Machina?

03:05:17.368 --> 03:05:25.786
SAM: Ooh! Is that a band of evildoers, is that a
roving goliath horde?

03:05:25.786 --> 03:05:30.459
LAURA: Where the fuck have you been? Who are you?
No really, who the fuck are you?

03:05:30.459 --> 03:05:34.249
SAM: My name is Taryon Darrington, I am an
adventurer,

03:05:34.249 --> 03:05:39.458
and I have more recently set out on my
journey, that is true.

03:05:39.458 --> 03:05:41.468
LAURA: This armor looks very new.

03:05:41.468 --> 03:05:48.736
SAM: I have not seen so many real battles yet,
but I have fought many beasts.

03:05:48.736 --> 03:05:49.915
LAURA: Mm.

03:05:49.966 --> 03:05:57.677
SAM: There was one, it was a smallish beholder,
and my men took it out into a field for me and

03:05:57.677 --> 03:06:01.850
sort of roughed it up for me, and then when the
time was right for the kill, they said "Come on in

03:06:01.850 --> 03:06:06.943
and kill it!" And I came in and used my powers and
killed it and I checked it off the list.

03:06:06.943 --> 03:06:08.729
LAURA: Oh, I see.

03:06:08.729 --> 03:06:12.968
SAM: Yes. It was so thrilling.

03:06:12.968 --> 03:06:15.990
TRAVIS: Your men, are you--

03:06:15.990 --> 03:06:17.755
LAURA: The ones that died.

03:06:17.755 --> 03:06:18.810
TRAVIS: Oh.

03:06:18.810 --> 03:06:20.118
LAURA: Right?

03:06:20.118 --> 03:06:23.772
SAM: They also perished, that was a different
group, yes.

03:06:23.772 --> 03:06:24.656
LAURA: Wonderful.

03:06:24.656 --> 03:06:30.011
SAM: But they were well-paid before they went,
and I'm sure they sent some of the money home.

03:06:30.011 --> 03:06:32.882
Some of them, I think they do that, typically.

03:06:32.882 --> 03:06:35.557
TRAVIS: What else is on your list, what're you
looking for?

03:06:35.557 --> 03:06:39.776
SAM: I've got a long list of beasts and animals
I'd like to slay--

03:06:39.776 --> 03:06:40.936
TRAVIS: Just give me one.

03:06:40.936 --> 03:06:44.207
SAM: Uh, naga, I think that's how you say it.

03:06:44.207 --> 03:06:45.303
LAURA: That is how you say it.

03:06:45.303 --> 03:06:46.390
TRAVIS. It's actually nah-jah.

03:06:46.390 --> 03:06:47.260
SAM: Okay.

03:06:47.260 --> 03:06:49.370
MARISHA: (laughs) Nah-jah!

03:06:49.370 --> 03:06:54.209
SAM: I've already gotten a smaller beholder.
Someday I'd like to see a dragon, maybe have a

03:06:54.209 --> 03:06:55.819
crack at it or two.

03:06:55.819 --> 03:06:58.803
LAURA: Oh, I'm sure you'd take it out in no time,
dear.

03:06:58.803 --> 03:06:59.514
TALIESIN: Right.

03:06:59.514 --> 03:07:00.853
MARISHA: Man, I fucking hate this guy.

03:07:00.853 --> 03:07:06.214
SAM: I feel like you're condescending to me! I'm
not, I'm not a dullard, here. I can do a lot of

03:07:06.214 --> 03:07:12.990
things! My wealth has bought me many different
artifacts from my travels,

03:07:12.990 --> 03:07:17.182
and they all do majorly magical things.

03:07:17.182 --> 03:07:18.907
TRAVIS: What kind of weapons does he have on him?

03:07:18.907 --> 03:07:21.409
SAM: I have a rod.

03:07:21.409 --> 03:07:22.341
LAURA: An Immovable Rod?

03:07:22.341 --> 03:07:23.384
TRAVIS: Is it movable?

03:07:23.384 --> 03:07:26.556
SAM: No, it's whatever I want it to be. Sword!

03:07:26.556 --> 03:07:30.870
MATT: You watch as the rod all of a sudden
transforms into this sudden liquid, metal-like

03:07:30.870 --> 03:07:34.413
visage, and then solidifies into a longsword.

03:07:34.413 --> 03:07:35.459
SAM: Fire!

03:07:35.459 --> 03:07:37.232
MATT: It bursts into flames.

03:07:37.232 --> 03:07:38.281
TRAVIS: Now that is fucking great.

03:07:38.281 --> 03:07:42.764
SAM: It's fucking cool, isn't it?!

03:07:42.764 --> 03:07:44.094
LAURA: How much money did that cost?

03:07:44.094 --> 03:07:51.375
SAM: Oh, like, 400,000 gold or something? It was a
lot of money. I don't quite... Doty keeps the

03:07:51.375 --> 03:07:54.456
facts and figures. Doty, can you show me that
piece of the book?

03:07:54.456 --> 03:07:57.879
MATT: (mechanical squeaks, pages turning,
squeaks). Turns it around.

03:07:57.879 --> 03:08:00.094
SAM: That's embarrassing.

03:08:00.094 --> 03:08:03.752
MATT: Shows the page to you and you glance through
it, and the actual construction of the item cost

03:08:03.752 --> 03:08:07.302
you upwards around 65 to 70,000 gold.

03:08:07.302 --> 03:08:09.394
LAURA: That's it?!

03:08:09.394 --> 03:08:10.453
MATT: It's a lot of money.

03:08:10.453 --> 03:08:12.367
LAURA: Well I know, but--

03:08:12.367 --> 03:08:17.345
TRAVIS: So wait, you want to come with us,
or you want us to come with you?

03:08:17.345 --> 03:08:22.606
SAM: I don't have a current adventure right now.
Fire off.

03:08:22.837 --> 03:08:29.953
Still getting used to some of the
contraptions.

03:08:29.953 --> 03:08:35.626
LAURA: Tell you what, Tary? 50,000 gold and you
can follow us right now as we finish this very

03:08:35.626 --> 03:08:37.386
adventurous errand we're running.

03:08:37.386 --> 03:08:38.617
MARISHA: What! Vex!

03:08:38.617 --> 03:08:39.292
TRAVIS: Yeah!

03:08:39.292 --> 03:08:40.062
MARISHA: What?!

03:08:40.062 --> 03:08:42.121
LAURA: 50,000 gold. Small fee.

03:08:42.121 --> 03:08:43.980
SAM: What kind of adventure is this, again? You
mentioned

03:08:43.980 --> 03:08:46.473
you're going to do something very dangerous.

03:08:46.473 --> 03:08:47.425
LAURA: It's so dangerous.

03:08:47.425 --> 03:08:48.495
TRAVIS: So dangerous.

03:08:48.495 --> 03:08:50.057
LAURA: We're going into this dangerous--

03:08:50.057 --> 03:08:51.044
SAM: Can you tell me what it is?

03:08:51.044 --> 03:08:52.018
LAURA: I'm afraid I can't, it's very--

03:08:52.018 --> 03:08:57.283
TRAVIS: It's a test of your reflexes, on point,
how you handle things you're not quite ready for.

03:08:57.349 --> 03:08:59.600
SAM: I could limber up, sure.

03:08:59.600 --> 03:09:02.362
LIAM: I stealth up behind Keyleth and rest my chin
on her shoulder and just say

03:09:02.362 --> 03:09:04.869
Whaaat the fuuuuck.

03:09:04.869 --> 03:09:07.757
(all laugh)

03:09:07.757 --> 03:09:08.722
MARISHA: And I just say

03:09:08.722 --> 03:09:11.940
I knoooow. 
Um, Vex.

03:09:11.940 --> 03:09:13.551
LAURA: What?

03:09:13.551 --> 03:09:16.637
TALIESIN: One moment, sir. Huddle.

03:09:16.637 --> 03:09:22.983
MARISHA: Huddle. Is 50,000 dollars worth dealing
with this annoying piece of shit?

03:09:22.983 --> 03:09:24.966
LAURA: While we go drop off a hand?

03:09:24.966 --> 03:09:32.910
MARISHA: Look, it just feels like when your guinea
pig dies as a kid and then you immediately get

03:09:32.910 --> 03:09:37.745
another guinea pig to replace it? This doesn't
feel good.

03:09:37.745 --> 03:09:38.707
TRAVIS: You don't like him, right?

03:09:38.707 --> 03:09:39.999
LAURA: You think he's replacing Scanlan?

03:09:39.999 --> 03:09:42.233
MARISHA: No! I just, I don't want another guinea
pig!

03:09:42.233 --> 03:09:46.947
LAURA: This piece of shit would never replace
Scanlan.

03:09:46.947 --> 03:09:56.744
MARISHA: He's a fabricator! He gets ghostwriters
to write all of his books, I bet he does!

03:09:56.744 --> 03:09:57.781
LIAM: He's a schmuck.

03:09:57.781 --> 03:10:00.339
TRAVIS: He probably does. Keyleth, you don't like
him very much, right?

03:10:00.339 --> 03:10:04.913
MARISHA: I don't like new people right now,
as of yesterday!

03:10:04.913 --> 03:10:11.828
TRAVIS: But like, 50,000 gold and we have ourself
a very flamboyant distraction if we need it.

03:10:11.828 --> 03:10:14.808
LAURA: Think about it, for 50,000 gold, we're only
15,000 gold away

03:10:14.808 --> 03:10:17.279
from getting one of those fucking
flaming swords!

03:10:17.279 --> 03:10:23.537
SAM: While they're talking, I'm working on my rod.
Battleaxe!

03:10:23.590 --> 03:10:25.653
LAURA: Look at how fucking cool that rod is!

03:10:25.836 --> 03:10:27.582
TRAVIS: He's in. He's fucking in.

03:10:27.582 --> 03:10:28.246
MARISHA: No!

03:10:28.246 --> 03:10:30.564
TRAVIS: Look at the battle axe! Holy shit!

03:10:30.564 --> 03:10:34.011
MARISHA: You guys, he's like the worst alter-ego
version of Percy!

03:10:34.080 --> 03:10:37.687
He's a rich kid who just buys all of his
cool toys. No offense, Percy.

03:10:37.733 --> 03:10:39.031
TALIESIN: None taken.

03:10:39.031 --> 03:10:41.806
(all laugh)

03:10:41.806 --> 03:10:44.637
MARISHA: It's true though! He's not legit!

03:10:44.637 --> 03:10:49.604
LIAM: I don't like him either, but I'll just say
two words: Hotis bait.

03:10:49.604 --> 03:10:51.413
TALIESIN: Yes, that's my thought.

03:10:51.413 --> 03:10:52.679
LAURA: Maybe he is Hotis.

03:10:52.679 --> 03:10:54.150
MARISHA: Oh yeah, what if he is Hotis?

03:10:54.150 --> 03:10:55.650
TRAVIS: He's not.

03:10:55.650 --> 03:10:57.511
MARISHA: How do you know, Grog?

03:10:57.511 --> 03:10:58.511
LIAM: He hasn't tried to seduce me.

03:10:58.511 --> 03:11:02.108
TRAVIS: I'm a dark wizard.

03:11:02.108 --> 03:11:03.098
LAURA: I've always known.

03:11:03.098 --> 03:11:06.196
TRAVIS: Yeah.

03:11:06.196 --> 03:11:12.316
TALIESIN: I'm not going to pretend I'm not mildly
entertained by the distraction at the very least.

03:11:12.316 --> 03:11:15.970
We just have to drop off a hand.

03:11:15.970 --> 03:11:18.548
MARISHA: And then he's gonna take credit for
dropping off a hand,

03:11:18.548 --> 03:11:21.563
like it's some crazy, miraculous thing!

03:11:21.563 --> 03:11:22.836
LAURA: Let him take credit for the hand.

03:11:22.836 --> 03:11:24.615
TALIESIN: Do you want credit for dropping off a
hand?

03:11:24.615 --> 03:11:28.875
MARISHA: No! I don't care. It's the principle of
the matter!

03:11:29.034 --> 03:11:33.709
TRAVIS: Is there a fighting arena in Marquet,
or anywhere

03:11:33.709 --> 03:11:35.597
we could find a scrap if we wanted to?

03:11:35.597 --> 03:11:39.932
MATT: I mean, I believe there is. Let me find the
name of it real fast.

03:11:39.932 --> 03:11:44.928
TALIESIN: We also could report in to a certain
dragon about things that have happened.

03:11:44.928 --> 03:11:49.182
LAURA: We actually need to because we promised
Jarett we would talk to J'mon.

03:11:49.182 --> 03:11:52.238
LIAM: So many things to do.

03:11:52.238 --> 03:11:53.696
TALIESIN: Let's just--

03:11:53.696 --> 03:11:55.691
LIAM: While Grog's thinking about that, I pull him
aside and say

03:11:55.691 --> 03:12:00.539
Did I ever show you I know how to
summon a dragon, d'you know how to do that?

03:12:00.539 --> 03:12:01.279
TRAVIS: No.

03:12:01.279 --> 03:12:09.875
LIAM: Watch and learn from my hand symbols.
What do you think of that, big guy?

03:12:09.875 --> 03:12:11.523
TRAVIS: And I grab his hands with the Titanstone
Knuckles--

03:12:11.523 --> 03:12:12.524
LIAM: Ow! Ow!

03:12:12.524 --> 03:12:13.369
TRAVIS: -- and squeeze.

03:12:13.369 --> 03:12:15.874
LIAM: Jeepers creepers, you've killed my dragon!

03:12:15.874 --> 03:12:16.632
MARISHA: Grog! Grog!

03:12:16.632 --> 03:12:17.464
TRAVIS: Don't --

03:12:17.464 --> 03:12:18.055
MARISHA: Grog! Grog!

03:12:18.055 --> 03:12:19.485
TRAVIS: -- summon the dragon. Uh, what?

03:12:19.485 --> 03:12:20.834
MARISHA: Grog, no, no, let go, Grog drop it,
Grog drop --

03:12:20.834 --> 03:12:21.537
TRAVIS: -- baby dragon

03:12:21.537 --> 03:12:23.756
MARISHA: Drop it, drop it, good boy!

03:12:23.756 --> 03:12:26.228
LIAM: See if I ever do anything nice for you
again! Jeez!

03:12:26.228 --> 03:12:29.199
TRAVIS: Well, I thought you were being taken over.
D'you need me to make sure you're all right?

03:12:29.199 --> 03:12:30.222
TALIESIN: Very proud of you Grog.

03:12:30.222 --> 03:12:33.179
LIAM: Will you kiss it? I thought so. And I walk
away.

03:12:33.179 --> 03:12:40.105
MARISHA: Grog.

03:12:40.105 --> 03:12:41.635
TRAVIS: He comes. C'mon.

03:12:41.635 --> 03:12:42.645
LIAM: We are fucking slap-happy.

03:12:42.645 --> 03:12:43.913
TALIESIN: C'mon then.

03:12:43.913 --> 03:12:45.818
TRAVIS: Besides I wanna see him get in a fight,
let's audition him at least.

03:12:45.818 --> 03:12:47.332
TALIESIN: Vex, let's let the money tag along.

03:12:47.332 --> 03:12:48.036
LAURA: Yeah.

03:12:48.036 --> 03:12:49.562
TALIESIN: It'll be fine.

03:12:49.562 --> 03:12:50.410
MARISHA: Okay, but I'm--

03:12:50.410 --> 03:12:51.622
LAURA: C'mon, pretty boy, let's go.

03:12:51.622 --> 03:12:52.985
MARISHA: -- gonna be pouty about this.

03:12:52.985 --> 03:12:56.712
SAM: Doty, take this down. As the group turned
around, I knew I had them.

03:12:56.712 --> 03:12:59.589
(all laugh)

03:12:59.589 --> 03:13:02.410
SAM: And our adventure was about to begin.
End chapter.

03:13:02.410 --> 03:13:03.790
(all laugh)

03:13:03.790 --> 03:13:06.707
LAURA: I hate him so much!

03:13:06.707 --> 03:13:08.219
MARISHA: I hate him so much!

03:13:08.219 --> 03:13:09.128
TRAVIS: I love him.

03:13:09.128 --> 03:13:10.441
LIAM: I miss Scanlan!

03:13:10.441 --> 03:13:15.521
(all laugh)

03:13:15.578 --> 03:13:19.518
MATT: As you guys decide against your better
judgment to

03:13:19.518 --> 03:13:21.863
accept your companion for the time being--

03:13:21.863 --> 03:13:23.222
LIAM: Don't like that word!

03:13:23.222 --> 03:13:26.767
MATT: -- you make your way into the Debt's Respite
Tavern to meet with

03:13:26.819 --> 03:13:30.866
Treev Bonebreaker and deliver the right hand.

03:13:30.866 --> 03:13:33.443
LAURA: Wait, wait, I wanted that gold up front!

03:13:33.443 --> 03:13:37.138
SAM: Oh! I don't carry 50,000 gold with me on my
person!

03:13:37.138 --> 03:13:39.246
LAURA: Well, you carry platinum, how much do you
have?

03:13:39.246 --> 03:13:41.057
SAM: I-- not--

03:13:41.057 --> 03:13:43.728
LAURA: Doty, how much platinum does he have on him
right now?

03:13:43.728 --> 03:13:44.629
SAM: Doty, go ahead and speak.

03:13:44.629 --> 03:13:45.568
MATT: No response.

03:13:45.568 --> 03:13:46.515
SAM: Go ahead, Doty, speak.

03:13:46.515 --> 03:13:47.205
LAURA: Doty!

03:13:47.205 --> 03:13:50.919
SAM: Oh, that's right, Doty can't speak.
Doty's a machine.

03:13:50.919 --> 03:13:55.217
LAURA: Doty, show me the ledger. How much platinum
does he have on his person right now?

03:13:55.217 --> 03:13:56.268
MATT: There's no response.

03:13:56.268 --> 03:13:59.042
LIAM: (robot beeping sound effects)

03:13:59.042 --> 03:14:04.786
SAM: Doty only listens to me. If you had some sort
of a pet, you would understand.

03:14:04.786 --> 03:14:07.809
TRAVIS: (gasps) Oh, I'm gonna love Tary so much!

03:14:07.809 --> 03:14:09.836
MARISHA: Vex! Vex, kick his ass!

03:14:09.836 --> 03:14:10.608
TRAVIS: I'm gonna love him so much.

03:14:10.608 --> 03:14:12.405
MARISHA: Kick his ass, Vex!

03:14:12.405 --> 03:14:14.754
LAURA: Gold up front or you don't join us.

03:14:14.754 --> 03:14:21.998
SAM: How about this? I'll give you a little
present, just for you, little elf girl. And I flip

03:14:21.998 --> 03:14:29.011
her a silver coin that I have put a spell into.
I've put--

03:14:29.011 --> 03:14:30.456
LAURA: I don't catch the coin.

03:14:30.456 --> 03:14:32.413
MARISHA: You're like all the bad things about the
internet as a character.

03:14:32.413 --> 03:14:34.941
LAURA: It's a piece of shit silver coin,
I don't need your stupid silver coin.

03:14:34.941 --> 03:14:37.503
SAM: It's a special coin, you should pick it up.

03:14:37.503 --> 03:14:38.615
TALIESIN: Did he flip the coin at her?

03:14:38.615 --> 03:14:39.365
MATT: He did.

03:14:39.365 --> 03:14:42.662
TALIESIN: I was thinking of intercepting it anyway
so--

03:14:42.662 --> 03:14:44.623
MATT: Okay. It would be easy to do with your
Gloves of Missile Snaring.

03:14:44.623 --> 03:14:46.931
TALIESIN: Yeah, I have Gloves of Missile Snaring.
I intercept it.

03:14:46.931 --> 03:14:51.445
SAM: Well, that was for the elf girl but all
right, sure, you can use it too. When you need it,

03:14:51.445 --> 03:14:57.941
if you just hold that coin up, you'll turn
invisible.

03:14:57.941 --> 03:15:01.469
TRAVIS: Seriously? An invisible-making coin?

03:15:01.469 --> 03:15:06.889
MARISHA: No! Grog, no! Do not show satisfaction in
the things he says.

03:15:06.889 --> 03:15:08.455
TRAVIS: This is just my gut reaction though.

03:15:08.455 --> 03:15:13.054
MARISHA. Even if you're impressed, we pretend like
we're not. Pretend like you're not impressed.

03:15:13.054 --> 03:15:14.668
TALIESIN: I'm not saying I can't be bought--

03:15:14.668 --> 03:15:15.684
LIAM: You said that very loud.

03:15:15.684 --> 03:15:16.592
SAM: Hey, big man.

03:15:16.592 --> 03:15:17.147
TRAVIS: Yeah.

03:15:17.147 --> 03:15:20.266
SAM: Look at this. Heavy crossbow!

03:15:20.266 --> 03:15:23.089
TRAVIS: It's the most amazing thing!

03:15:23.089 --> 03:15:24.023
MARISHA: Grog!

03:15:24.023 --> 03:15:28.792
TRAVIS: I mean, hold on! Not impressed.

03:15:28.792 --> 03:15:30.200
SAM: You can shoot it!

03:15:30.200 --> 03:15:31.022
TRAVIS: I wanna shoot it!

03:15:31.022 --> 03:15:33.825
(all laugh)

03:15:33.825 --> 03:15:34.657
TRAVIS: (bvvm!)

03:15:34.657 --> 03:15:36.456
MATT: (tsoo!)

03:15:36.456 --> 03:15:39.118
TRAVIS: Yeah, oh shit, take it back.

03:15:39.118 --> 03:15:42.272
MATT: You have no idea where it went, it arced way
out of your line of sight.

03:15:42.272 --> 03:15:45.363
SAM: That was pretty good.

03:15:45.363 --> 03:15:46.121
TRAVIS: That's cool.

03:15:46.121 --> 03:15:47.642
SAM: Yes!

03:15:47.642 --> 03:15:49.875
TRAVIS: He stays.

03:15:49.875 --> 03:15:53.572
TALIESIN: Let's get the hand to its final
destination.

03:15:53.572 --> 03:15:55.321
LAURA: Ugh!

03:15:55.321 --> 03:15:56.768
TRAVIS: Or you can kill him and take the weapon
later.

03:15:56.768 --> 03:15:57.802
LAURA: I will.

03:15:57.802 --> 03:16:05.493
LIAM: He's slow. None of the rest of us like you,
so fucking watch it, all right?

03:16:05.493 --> 03:16:07.423
LAURA: We're such dicks!

03:16:07.423 --> 03:16:15.179
SAM: And with that we embarked on our new
adventure! The adventures of, what was it again?

03:16:15.179 --> 03:16:16.169
TALIESIN: (sighs)

03:16:16.169 --> 03:16:18.021
LIAM: What a dillweed!

03:16:18.021 --> 03:16:20.299
SAM: This is going to be fun, fun, fun!

03:16:20.299 --> 03:16:23.671
(all laugh)

03:16:23.671 --> 03:16:27.527
MATT: As you walk into the Debt's Respite Tavern,
we're gonna end tonight's session there and pick

03:16:27.527 --> 03:16:28.429
this up next week.

03:16:28.429 --> 03:16:36.481
(all cheer, groan, yell)

03:16:36.481 --> 03:16:38.288
LIAM: You break our hearts and then pull that
asshole out?

03:16:38.288 --> 03:16:42.900
LAURA: You asshole! How dare you? How dare you?

03:16:42.900 --> 03:16:44.642
TALIESIN: Unbelievable!

03:16:44.642 --> 03:16:45.655
MATT: Oh, it's beautiful.

03:16:45.655 --> 03:16:49.426
LAURA: I am so angry at you!

03:16:49.426 --> 03:16:53.182
MARISHA: You were on the Critical Role wikia last
night weren't you?

03:16:53.182 --> 03:16:54.013
TRAVIS: Tary berry.

03:16:54.013 --> 03:16:55.029
TALIESIN: Yes, he was, he has it all--

03:16:55.029 --> 03:16:56.061
SAM: Tary Darrington.

03:16:56.061 --> 03:16:59.021
LIAM: You ain't know all our characters' mothers'
names, you motherfucker.

03:16:59.021 --> 03:17:00.306
SAM: I know all of your parents' names.

03:17:00.306 --> 03:17:01.989
LIAM: After Googling that shit!

03:17:01.989 --> 03:17:02.962
SAM: Because I love you!

03:17:02.962 --> 03:17:03.943
LAURA: Whatever!

03:17:03.943 --> 03:17:05.021
SAM: I love you so much!

03:17:05.021 --> 03:17:07.947
LAURA: Sam you're the least-- you don't care about
any of it!

03:17:07.947 --> 03:17:08.914
SAM: I am the most sincere!

03:17:08.914 --> 03:17:10.980
LAURA: You're a dick!

03:17:10.980 --> 03:17:12.610
TRAVIS: That was amazing.

03:17:12.610 --> 03:17:14.277
LIAM: It was amazing, it was amazing.

03:17:14.277 --> 03:17:16.952
TALIESIN: I love that-- I wish that everyone could
see that the crew is in

03:17:16.952 --> 03:17:18.590
utter revolt behind us right now.

03:17:18.590 --> 03:17:20.154
MARISHA: Yes! Get him! Get him!

03:17:20.154 --> 03:17:21.477
TALIESIN: And they've all got nerf guns!

03:17:21.477 --> 03:17:24.726
LAURA: Get him! Get him! He deserves it!

03:17:24.726 --> 03:17:27.370
LIAM and TALIESIN: You're tearing this family
apart!

03:17:27.370 --> 03:17:29.796
SAM: No, I'm Tary-ing this-- Tarying this--

03:17:29.796 --> 03:17:32.878
MATT: Tary-ing this family apart, oh my god!

03:17:32.878 --> 03:17:35.820
