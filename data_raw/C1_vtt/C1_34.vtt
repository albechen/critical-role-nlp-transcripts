00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.245
MATT: And welcome to tonight's fantastical episode
of Critical Role.

00:00:03.245 --> 00:00:04.493
ZAC: Fantastical?

00:00:04.493 --> 00:00:05.433
MATT: Fantastical.

00:00:05.433 --> 00:00:06.337
ZAC: Testicular.

00:00:06.337 --> 00:00:11.025
MATT: It is. It is a testicle episode of Critical
Role. Sorry for the delay. We had some technical

00:00:11.025 --> 00:00:16.766
issues as tonight we do have the wondrous Ashley
Johnson joining us via Skype for this climactic

00:00:16.766 --> 00:00:17.590
episode.

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:19.341
ZAC: Cue cut to Ashley!

00:00:19.341 --> 00:00:28.132
MATT: Yay! Hi Ashley! She's dancing for it. So
sorry for the delay, but we're on here.

00:00:28.132 --> 00:00:32.422
ZAC: We've got a couple of quick announcements.
The first announcement is that we're currently

00:00:32.422 --> 00:00:38.972
doing a d20 holiday giveaway over on our Facebook
page. That's 20 days of giveaways. We're now on

00:00:38.972 --> 00:00:46.926
day three and it's a large collection of Dungeons
and Dragons related stuff. There's a command in

00:00:46.926 --> 00:00:51.701
the chatroom that the mods are posting right now
if you check that out and we'll also be putting an

00:00:51.701 --> 00:00:55.660
image up on the screen later that gives you a link
out to it and all that good stuff, so make sure

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:01.163
you enter. Lucas has got it up right now. Follow
that link, enter, try to win some D&amp;amp;D cool stuff.

00:01:01.163 --> 00:01:09.166
The other big announcement is tomorrow we have a
special Beatles Rubber Soul anniversary concert.

00:01:09.166 --> 00:01:10.985
We have eight different bands coming through--

00:01:10.985 --> 00:01:12.595
SAM: Including the Beatles.

00:01:12.595 --> 00:01:15.378
ZAC: Yeah.

00:01:15.378 --> 00:01:17.266
TALIESIN: Roaches.

00:01:17.266 --> 00:01:21.089
ZAC: But we have some really great bands coming
through, it's going to be a lot of fun and we're

00:01:21.174 --> 00:01:25.809
going to finish out the night with some Beatles
Rock Band so that's going to be really cool. And

00:01:25.894 --> 00:01:29.830
on top of that and Group Hug tomorrow, Disney is
really excited about the Ant Man Blu-ray release

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:31.734
so they're sending us--

00:01:31.734 --> 00:01:33.344
(audio echo)

00:01:33.344 --> 00:01:40.563
ZAC: Oh, we're getting a looped feedback. I think
we're good. And we're going to be doing a special

00:01:40.563 --> 00:01:46.790
Ant Man-themed Group Hug with a ton of giveaways
coming to us from Disney to give away during the

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:54.022
show. And then on Monday, Michele Morrow during
Massive is giving away a Valve key that was sent

00:01:54.022 --> 00:01:59.523
to her and basically it unlocks every single game
Valve has ever made, as well as every game they

00:01:59.523 --> 00:02:04.241
will make. So basically, you could own Half-Life
3.

00:02:04.241 --> 00:02:06.577
MATT: That's a Valve golden ticket.

00:02:06.577 --> 00:02:10.532
ZAC: It is. It's a Valve golden ticket. She's
giving it away at 1:30 on Monday, so make sure to

00:02:10.532 --> 00:02:14.984
tune in for that. It's the only way to own
Half-Life 3, maybe.

00:02:14.984 --> 00:02:16.846
MARISHA: Are employees eligible?

00:02:16.846 --> 00:02:18.535
ZAC: Are employees eligible?

00:02:18.535 --> 00:02:22.760
MATT: Technically, we're not employees, but no.

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.289
ZAC: Damn it.

00:02:25.289 --> 00:02:30.750
TALIESIN: I can be active in the chatroom. I'll be
so active in the chatroom.

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:36.266
MATT: It is tempting. Okay, so a couple of
announcements we have on our end to get things

00:02:36.266 --> 00:02:41.264
started as we wait for Laura Bailey to arrive.
She's currently driving here as fast as she can

00:02:41.264 --> 00:02:48.026
from The Video Game Awards, where they announced
her character in Uncharted. That's awesome! Super

00:02:48.026 --> 00:02:49.234
stoked about that.

00:02:49.234 --> 00:02:50.384
LIAM: Another great indie game.

00:02:50.384 --> 00:02:52.095
MATT: Yeah, no, I'm really pulling for that
series.

00:02:52.095 --> 00:02:54.048
MARISHA: Hope it does well.

00:02:54.048 --> 00:03:00.004
TALIESIN: I hope it gets the recognition it so
should get. Rises above a cult hit.

00:03:00.004 --> 00:03:06.962
MATT: She'll be here shortly, but congrats to
Laura on that whenever she arrives. Let's see.

00:03:06.962 --> 00:03:12.549
Starting at eight o'clock tonight. It's a little
delayed due to scheduling craziness but starting

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:18.856
at 8:00 tonight, you will be able to see Ashley
Johnson's playlist for Pike on the website will be

00:03:18.856 --> 00:03:19.841
going up.

00:03:19.841 --> 00:03:21.785
LIAM: It's pretty rich.

00:03:21.785 --> 00:03:24.545
MATT: It's an awesome one. Been listening to it
for a lot of the day.

00:03:24.545 --> 00:03:25.713
ASHLEY: Yeah!

00:03:25.713 --> 00:03:31.294
MATT: Indeed! So that'll be going up at 8:00
tonight, and I believe mine will be going up next

00:03:31.294 --> 00:03:39.978
week. That one's been an adventure in crafting so
far so I hope you guys enjoy that. Let me throw to

00:03:39.978 --> 00:03:41.857
you guys for the comic if you want to go through
that real fast.

00:03:41.857 --> 00:03:43.673
TALIESIN: Comic went up on Wednesday.

00:03:43.673 --> 00:03:45.791
MARISHA: Yeah, and last week when we weren't
here.

00:03:45.791 --> 00:03:46.845
TALIESIN: Two comics.

00:03:46.845 --> 00:03:47.878
MARISHA: Two comics!

00:03:47.878 --> 00:03:49.382
TALIESIN: What are you going to do?

00:03:49.382 --> 00:03:50.970
SAM: Where do you find those comics, guys?

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.515
MARISHA: You can find those comics at
geekandsundry.com.

00:03:53.515 --> 00:03:56.486
SAM: Okay, and what are they?

00:03:56.486 --> 00:04:02.299
MARISHA: They're awesome little four-panel weekly
comic strips going through the backstory of Vox

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:04.063
Machina at the Winter's Crest Festival.

00:04:04.063 --> 00:04:07.149
TALIESIN: Our first Winter's Crest Festival
together running around, causing havoc, being

00:04:07.149 --> 00:04:08.869
adorable. Just in time for Christmas.

00:04:08.869 --> 00:04:11.515
SAM: And those viewers have to pay extra to get
that, don't they?

00:04:11.515 --> 00:04:12.863
MARISHA: Not at all, Sam!

00:04:12.863 --> 00:04:13.843
SAM: What?

00:04:13.843 --> 00:04:16.522
MARISHA: Of course! This is all free through the
Geek and Sundry website.

00:04:16.522 --> 00:04:18.917
SAM: Oh my goodness! Well, I'm going to click on
it right now.

00:04:18.917 --> 00:04:20.882
MARISHA: You should! After the show.

00:04:20.882 --> 00:04:21.681
SAM: Okay.

00:04:21.681 --> 00:04:24.919
(laughter)

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:30.840
MATT: Thank you guys. Yeah, it's actually a pretty
fun arc. It's one of the more lighthearted Vox

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:32.485
Machina background moments.

00:04:32.485 --> 00:04:35.465
MARISHA: It's us being cute, surrounded by all the
sadness.

00:04:35.465 --> 00:04:36.536
TALIESIN: Eight weeks of cute.

00:04:36.536 --> 00:04:38.058
LIAM: We'll be cute in three hours.

00:04:38.058 --> 00:04:40.096
SAM: We'll be dead in three hours.

00:04:40.096 --> 00:04:41.858
MATT: Don't say that! You don't know.

00:04:41.858 --> 00:04:43.968
TALIESIN: We need photography of the 19th century
over here.

00:04:43.968 --> 00:04:46.867
MATT: Well, dice will tell.

00:04:46.867 --> 00:04:55.001
LIAM: I can't wait to see the old-timey photos of
our propped up dead bodies. Dressed finely.

00:04:55.001 --> 00:04:56.659
MATT: You're horrible.

00:04:56.659 --> 00:05:00.676
TALIESIN: I'm just saying we need daguerreotypes.
I think it might be time to do it.

00:05:00.676 --> 00:05:06.639
MATT: Perfect. Also, I recently found out that
Obsidian had released the Pillars of Eternity

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:11.446
soundtrack on iTunes. The same soundtrack that
they let us use on our show for background. It's

00:05:11.446 --> 00:05:15.096
an awesome soundtrack, and if you're a fan of the
game or if you're just a fan of good atmospheric

00:05:15.096 --> 00:05:18.943
soundtrack music, go check it out. It's on iTunes,
so thank you Obsidian again!

00:05:18.943 --> 00:05:20.624
MARISHA and LIAM: Thanks, Obsidian!

00:05:20.624 --> 00:05:27.039
MATT: Critmas for this month is next week. We
pushed it back a week because tonight's episode is

00:05:27.039 --> 00:05:32.377
a little crazy or it's looking to become so,
depending, and we wanted to give you a little more

00:05:32.377 --> 00:05:36.726
time to get things in for Critmas for the actual
holiday season. So we'll be calling it Critmas

00:05:36.726 --> 00:05:38.372
slash what was it you said, Taliesin?

00:05:38.372 --> 00:05:40.930
TALIESIN: Oh, Voxanukkah!

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:43.446
MATT: Voxanukkah, there we go.
Critmas/Voxanukkah.

00:05:43.446 --> 00:05:45.152
(laughter)

00:05:45.152 --> 00:05:46.666
TALIESIN: I'll keep them coming.

00:05:46.666 --> 00:05:54.581
MATT: Yeah, this'll be our fun month event. We're
excited about that. Let's see. If you want to go

00:05:54.581 --> 00:05:56.190
ahead and take the announcement--

00:05:56.190 --> 00:06:00.331
LIAM: Yeah. Yes, many of you have been taking
advantage of our code CRITROLE with Wyrmwood

00:06:00.331 --> 00:06:06.055
Gaming, but not all of you so the rest of you go
over to Wyrmwood Gaming. If you use CRITROLE, you

00:06:06.055 --> 00:06:14.824
get free shipping for any of their beautiful
boxes. Mine is Gabon ebony. It's black I really

00:06:14.824 --> 00:06:15.776
like it.

00:06:15.776 --> 00:06:18.830
MATT: I hope it's Gabon. Because you already
mentioned Valve at one point tonight and it's

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:20.765
important that we all pray to Gaben together.

00:06:20.765 --> 00:06:23.675
LIAM: They're gorgeous. Many different colors.
Make great Christmas present stocking stuffers.

00:06:23.675 --> 00:06:26.913
Put your dice in them. You'll like them.

00:06:26.913 --> 00:06:29.866
ASHLEY: I haven't gotten to see mine in person
yet, and I'm excited.

00:06:29.866 --> 00:06:31.138
MARISHA: We have yours.

00:06:31.138 --> 00:06:33.116
MATT: We've got to get it to you when you come
back in town.

00:06:33.116 --> 00:06:34.064
ASHLEY: Yeah!

00:06:34.064 --> 00:06:39.191
MATT: By the way, thank you for tweeting your
comics today, which sent everyone into a tizzy

00:06:39.191 --> 00:06:40.927
thinking that you were here in LA.

00:06:40.927 --> 00:06:42.494
SAM and MATT: Including us.

00:06:42.494 --> 00:06:49.968
ASHLEY: I know! I didn't even mean-- I just pulled
them out of my suitcase today. And then some

00:06:49.968 --> 00:06:54.937
people were tweeting back and I was like, "Oh,
shit. It looks like I'm at home." I was like,

00:06:54.937 --> 00:06:56.104
"Ah, well."

00:06:56.104 --> 00:06:58.077
TRAVIS: Mass panic, it's no big deal.

00:06:58.077 --> 00:07:01.706
MATT: You're technically still here. And you know
what, actually right next to Travis, you guys are

00:07:01.884 --> 00:07:03.852
size appropriate for the group, so it works out
well.

00:07:03.852 --> 00:07:05.133
ASHLEY: Really? (laughs)

00:07:05.133 --> 00:07:06.838
TRAVIS: Hello, Pike!

00:07:06.838 --> 00:07:09.835
ASHLEY: Wait for it. "Oh hi, Grog!"

00:07:09.835 --> 00:07:11.274
TRAVIS: Oh hi, Pike!

00:07:11.274 --> 00:07:12.630
(laughter)

00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:14.060
MATT and MARISHA: There we go.

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:14.818
MATT: That's amazing.

00:07:14.818 --> 00:07:16.557
ASHLEY: Wait, high five!

00:07:16.557 --> 00:07:23.540
MATT: Yay! Slowest high five ever. Awesome. Then
just reminding you guys, we've got a couple more

00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:28.527
weeks before the holiday season. We got a bunch of
our awesome shirts up on the website including the

00:07:28.592 --> 00:07:31.858
How Do You Want To Do This? shirt that Marisha's
wearing tonight, which is apparently also selling

00:07:31.858 --> 00:07:32.946
out again.

00:07:32.946 --> 00:07:34.199
MARISHA: Oh, is it sold out again?

00:07:34.199 --> 00:07:35.272
MATT: Certain sizes are.

00:07:35.272 --> 00:07:36.385
MARISHA: Certain sizes are?

00:07:36.385 --> 00:07:38.732
MATT: We're pushing to get more in, hopefully.

00:07:38.732 --> 00:07:40.745
SAM: Better get them while you can.

00:07:40.745 --> 00:07:43.465
MATT: And the Critmas sweater, which is
delightful, too.

00:07:43.465 --> 00:07:46.501
TRAVIS: It is delightful, isn't it?

00:07:46.501 --> 00:07:50.791
SAM: You can also get these by donating to the
Obama campaign eight years ago. Just so you know.

00:07:50.791 --> 00:07:52.894
TRAVIS: I don't know if they have any left but
they might.

00:07:52.894 --> 00:07:58.726
MATT: Does anybody else have any announcements
they want to make at this time?

00:07:58.726 --> 00:08:01.593
LIAM: I am nervous.

00:08:01.593 --> 00:08:03.125
ASHLEY: I am so nervous.

00:08:03.125 --> 00:08:04.336
MARISHA: And terrified.

00:08:04.336 --> 00:08:05.613
TRAVIS: I'm calm.

00:08:05.613 --> 00:08:14.712
MATT: Perfect, perfect. Well, cool. That being the
case, then, let's go ahead and let's go ahead

00:08:14.794 --> 00:08:16.049
and jump in.

00:08:16.049 --> 00:08:18.147
TRAVIS: Oh shit, okay.

00:08:18.147 --> 00:08:27.055
MATT: Exactly. To get you guys up to speed: the
party, Vox Machina, after having a relatively

00:08:27.055 --> 00:08:32.359
violent encounter with a couple known as the
Briarwoods-- Lady Delilah Briarwood and Lord Sylas

00:08:32.359 --> 00:08:38.379
Briarwood, two individuals who were responsible
for essentially torturing and murdering Percy's

00:08:38.448 --> 00:08:43.891
family and taking over his town of Whitestone and
for the past five years have ruled it, guiding it

00:08:43.891 --> 00:08:50.629
into some dark direction they've begun to recently
unravel. The party traveled to Whitestone to clear

00:08:50.694 --> 00:08:55.230
their name as they were essentially put in a bad
political position with their home town of Emon

00:08:55.230 --> 00:09:02.417
and to possibly bring vengeance for what Percy's
family had undergone five years before.

00:09:02.417 --> 00:09:09.555
Upon arriving they found the town in a very dark
emotional place. Zombie giants roving the streets

00:09:09.555 --> 00:09:16.258
as these controlled centurions. A number of
individuals in the town feeling the general

00:09:16.258 --> 00:09:25.672
unrest. And they decided to build a revolt. Percy
helming the de Rolo crest, Vox Machina went around

00:09:25.672 --> 00:09:30.430
inciting the thoughts of rebellion in the city.
Not the first but apparently the one with the most

00:09:30.430 --> 00:09:39.107
chance of succeeding they've had to this date.
After some infiltrations and sizable victories

00:09:39.107 --> 00:09:45.087
cutting down some of the underlings of the
Briarwoods within the city, the people began to

00:09:45.087 --> 00:09:53.094
arm themselves, rise up, and fire, blade and
screaming took the city as the denizens began to

00:09:53.094 --> 00:09:58.935
fight back. In this chaos, Vox Machina made their
way underneath the Castle Whitestone, where the

00:09:58.935 --> 00:10:04.354
Lord and Lady Briarwood currently reside, seeking
some sort of a project called the ziggurat they've

00:10:04.354 --> 00:10:06.114
been working on for a while.

00:10:06.114 --> 00:10:10.023
While they were down there they found a woman,
apparently imprisoned, under an illusion that they

00:10:10.023 --> 00:10:16.014
revealed to be Anna Ripley. Dr. Anna Ripley, one
of the torturers of Percy five years before and

00:10:16.014 --> 00:10:22.288
currently seemingly interested in the black powder
based gun tech he had been developing. However,

00:10:22.288 --> 00:10:27.967
they took her captive, went upstairs, and
discovered that Percy's sister, Cassandra, is

00:10:27.967 --> 00:10:34.193
indeed still alive and being held captive within
the castle. In the process of trying to save her

00:10:34.193 --> 00:10:39.893
Anna Ripley got away, Cassandra got her throat cut
but thankfully was saved by the quick actions of

00:10:39.893 --> 00:10:48.141
Vox Machina and the near death's door stepping of
Vax once again. But nevertheless, saved her,

00:10:48.141 --> 00:10:50.274
prevented her disastrous fate--

00:10:50.274 --> 00:10:52.448
LIAM: Before anyone entered the room.

00:10:52.448 --> 00:10:53.791
MATT: That's true.

00:10:53.791 --> 00:10:58.725
(laughter)

00:10:58.725 --> 00:11:05.937
MATT: So, having Cassandra saved, some intense
conversations began. Some discussions of some

00:11:05.937 --> 00:11:13.904
elements of the Briarwoods' real intentions. They
found notes within Professor Anders's room, one of

00:11:13.904 --> 00:11:20.074
the other individuals responsible for rising up
against Percy's family back in the day. Found

00:11:20.074 --> 00:11:24.813
materials that could clear their name back in Emon
and Cassandra armed up. They made their way down

00:11:24.813 --> 00:11:30.554
to the basement of the city into the undercroft
and through the mausoleum that contained the

00:11:30.554 --> 00:11:33.536
descendants of the de Rolo family.

00:11:33.536 --> 00:11:37.919
After which, a series of ghosts, seemingly
haunting that vicinity since the darkness that

00:11:37.919 --> 00:11:42.936
took this kingdom took hold, began to possess the
party into a rough battle in which they were

00:11:42.936 --> 00:11:50.356
forced to fight themselves. The ghosts were
ousted, destroyed, and the party, regathering what

00:11:50.356 --> 00:11:57.442
powers they still have at their disposal to begin
to delve into the seemingly recently dug tunnel

00:11:57.442 --> 00:12:03.298
beneath the city of Whitestone towards whatever
this ziggurat project is. And that is where we

00:12:03.298 --> 00:12:05.036
left off last time.

00:12:05.036 --> 00:12:14.275
As you guys have taken a moment to gather
your breath after the undercroft infiltration of

00:12:14.361 --> 00:12:19.228
these spirits, one of the last of which Scanlan
shamed into a redeath--

00:12:19.228 --> 00:12:22.153
(laughter)

00:12:22.153 --> 00:12:29.492
MATT: You've all gathered yourself, taken a short
rest to heal up. Whatever else you want to do to

00:12:29.492 --> 00:12:35.786
prepare at this time. You know, discussion, items,
preparation, trading, anything you want to do

00:12:35.786 --> 00:12:39.929
before you delve any further into this tunnel
underneath the city of Whitestone, now is the time

00:12:39.929 --> 00:12:40.905
to do so.

00:12:40.905 --> 00:12:46.570
SAM: We're in the crypt? The sarcophagus sort of
thing.

00:12:46.570 --> 00:12:48.415
MATT: That's the actual official name, yes.

00:12:48.415 --> 00:12:52.546
LIAM: Percival, do you know anything-- Do you know
what's just ahead of us?

00:12:52.611 --> 00:12:55.144
TALIESIN: I don't think so.

00:12:55.144 --> 00:13:01.365
MATT: No, the back wall of this mausoleum was
originally just a wall. There was a large

00:13:01.365 --> 00:13:09.342
20-foot wide cavern that is chiseled through
the stonework and appears to delve deeper into the

00:13:09.550 --> 00:13:10.983
ground behind them.

00:13:10.983 --> 00:13:15.837
ALL: Whoa!

00:13:15.837 --> 00:13:17.869
MATT: We got a Laura Bailey!

00:13:17.869 --> 00:13:19.763
LAURA: What's up, buddies?

00:13:19.763 --> 00:13:22.883
LIAM: Award show variant costume!

00:13:22.883 --> 00:13:25.394
(laughter)

00:13:25.394 --> 00:13:28.113
MATT: The Comic-Con night on the town.

00:13:28.113 --> 00:13:31.618
LAURA: That's right. (gasps) Hey Ashley!

00:13:31.618 --> 00:13:36.334
ASHLEY: Oh, hello Laura! You look so pretty!

00:13:36.334 --> 00:13:39.442
LAURA: Oh my gosh, that's so cool!

00:13:39.442 --> 00:13:41.042
LIAM: She can't see you there.

00:13:41.042 --> 00:13:42.565
MATT: Congratulations, by the way.

00:13:42.565 --> 00:13:43.668
LAURA: Oh, thank you!

00:13:43.668 --> 00:13:44.626
SAM: Did you--?

00:13:44.626 --> 00:13:47.470
LAURA: No, I didn't win. They were unveiling my
character in Uncharted tonight.

00:13:47.470 --> 00:13:49.116
SAM: Did you go onstage?

00:13:49.116 --> 00:13:55.236
LAURA: I didn't, no. I just sat there and then I
went, "Okay, well, I've got to go!" And I got up

00:13:55.236 --> 00:13:57.082
and ran and I feel like an idiot.

00:13:57.082 --> 00:13:58.224
TRAVIS: We got Briarwoods to kill.

00:13:58.224 --> 00:14:00.780
TALIESIN: Briorities.

00:14:00.780 --> 00:14:03.572
MATT: Well, I'm glad you could join us. Thank you
for that.

00:14:03.572 --> 00:14:04.911
SAM: Did you say Briorities?

00:14:04.911 --> 00:14:05.920
TALIESIN: Briorities.

00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:06.988
LAURA: Briorities.

00:14:06.988 --> 00:14:08.241
MATT: Taliesin!

00:14:08.241 --> 00:14:12.111
TRAVIS: We don't know if we have any further to go
from this crypt? Uncharted?

00:14:12.111 --> 00:14:17.582
LAURA: That's my thing! Oh, there's no drink in
my--

00:14:17.582 --> 00:14:18.969
LIAM: Well, go quick.

00:14:18.969 --> 00:14:20.553
MARISHA: Do it, it's fine. We're just starting.

00:14:20.553 --> 00:14:21.950
LIAM: I didn't want to touch it.

00:14:21.950 --> 00:14:25.163
TALIESIN: We've literally not had a conversation.

00:14:25.163 --> 00:14:26.504
MARISHA: We haven't done anything.

00:14:26.504 --> 00:14:28.031
SAM: All right, I'm going to charge in!

00:14:28.031 --> 00:14:31.428
(laughter)

00:14:31.428 --> 00:14:38.971
TRAVIS: I would like to take a vial of holy oil
that I have out of the Bag of Holding and keep it

00:14:38.971 --> 00:14:43.563
in my hand. Just out, so I don't have to get it
out.

00:14:43.563 --> 00:14:49.118
MARISHA: Grog, speaking of. How many health
potions do you have? I feel like we might need to

00:14:49.118 --> 00:14:50.308
redistribute.

00:14:50.308 --> 00:14:52.918
TRAVIS: I have a shitload. I never really use
them.

00:14:52.918 --> 00:14:54.550
MARISHA: You should do that.

00:14:54.550 --> 00:14:59.514
TRAVIS: I have two level awesome-- what are the
biggest ones?

00:14:59.514 --> 00:15:00.807
SAM: Greater?

00:15:00.807 --> 00:15:02.210
MATT: There's greater or superior.

00:15:02.210 --> 00:15:07.304
TRAVIS: I have two superior, one the top one, and
five of the low ones.

00:15:07.366 --> 00:15:09.355
TALIESIN: Can I take two of the low ones,
possibly?

00:15:09.355 --> 00:15:12.621
MATT: Superior would be the highest you've
received so far.

00:15:12.621 --> 00:15:14.047
TRAVIS: Okay then I have one of those.

00:15:14.047 --> 00:15:18.725
LIAM: I am all out of tricks, just about, so may I
please have a superior, Grog?

00:15:18.725 --> 00:15:21.528
TRAVIS: Oh boy, does everybody want a piece of this
pie?

00:15:21.528 --> 00:15:24.252
(laughter)

00:15:24.324 --> 00:15:26.653
TRAVIS: Well, what are you offering?

00:15:26.653 --> 00:15:34.535
LIAM: I'm offering safety for your facial hair for
perpetuity.

00:15:34.535 --> 00:15:36.403
TRAVIS: Nope. Give me something else.

00:15:36.403 --> 00:15:37.659
LIAM: Now it's in danger.

00:15:37.659 --> 00:15:43.616
MARISHA: How about safety for your life because
we'll be having your back and whatnot?

00:15:43.616 --> 00:15:48.898
TRAVIS: How could you have my back if it's on me?

00:15:48.898 --> 00:15:52.035
MARISHA: I'm going to let that one go.

00:15:52.035 --> 00:16:00.974
LIAM: I will let you flick me hard, hard in the
nads, should we survive.

00:16:01.043 --> 00:16:06.246
TRAVIS: How about you let me flick you hard in the
nads now and I'll give you a healing potion?

00:16:06.246 --> 00:16:08.377
LIAM: Can we take a short rest after that?

00:16:08.377 --> 00:16:10.577
(laughter)

00:16:10.577 --> 00:16:12.638
LAURA: What is happening? (laughs)

00:16:12.638 --> 00:16:16.207
TRAVIS: Just a little one. I won't even rage or
nothing. It'll just be a quick little tap on your

00:16:16.207 --> 00:16:17.533
walnut.

00:16:17.533 --> 00:16:19.279
LIAM: I will do this trade.

00:16:19.279 --> 00:16:25.145
TRAVIS: Yes! I kneel down and I get right up to
his bits.

00:16:25.145 --> 00:16:30.744
LIAM: Wait! I pull a stick out of my bag and I put
it in my mouth and I bite down very hard on it.

00:16:30.744 --> 00:16:39.077
SAM: I'm going to use Minor Illusion to create a
bull's eye right around his crotch. Concentric

00:16:39.077 --> 00:16:41.414
circles glowing.

00:16:41.414 --> 00:16:45.257
TRAVIS: And like the second grader I am trying to
write in cursive I have my tongue sticking out

00:16:45.257 --> 00:16:52.163
like-- and I shift from using the middle finger
down to the ring finger because we're being nice.

00:16:52.163 --> 00:16:54.933
And I go for-- are you right-handed?

00:16:54.933 --> 00:16:56.279
LIAM: Yeah.

00:16:56.279 --> 00:16:59.729
TRAVIS: I go for the left nut. (whack)

00:16:59.729 --> 00:17:01.838
LIAM: (groans)

00:17:01.838 --> 00:17:07.064
TRAVIS: Does he throw up?

00:17:07.064 --> 00:17:10.735
MATT: No, but you do take one point of damage.

00:17:10.735 --> 00:17:12.055
TRAVIS: Yes!

00:17:12.055 --> 00:17:16.350
LAURA: Just one? It's just a ring finger but it's
still a goliath.

00:17:16.350 --> 00:17:18.884
TRAVIS: Is there a little cough?

00:17:18.884 --> 00:17:23.315
MATT: Yeah, there's definitely enough of a
reaction to be worth your--

00:17:23.315 --> 00:17:27.389
LIAM: (hoarse) There's no sound. At all.

00:17:27.389 --> 00:17:31.225
TRAVIS: All right. I will give you one of the--
there's three different levels or just the two?

00:17:31.225 --> 00:17:36.094
MATT: Well, you have, you have common. Sorry, the
healing potion, the greater healing and the

00:17:36.094 --> 00:17:37.004
superior.

00:17:37.004 --> 00:17:39.089
LIAM: (hoarse) The good one, fucker.

00:17:39.089 --> 00:17:49.975
TRAVIS: I'll give you the greater. I give him a
greater. And Percy. I like it when you turn into

00:17:49.975 --> 00:17:55.383
the giant cloud thing so you don't have to take a
nutshot. Would you like a common or a greater?

00:17:55.383 --> 00:17:59.173
TALIESIN: Actually, if I could steal two commons,
just to be on the safe side.

00:17:59.173 --> 00:18:03.725
TRAVIS: Yeah, okay. I give him two common.

00:18:03.725 --> 00:18:07.902
TALIESIN: I offer the satisfaction of Vax knowing
that I got them for free.

00:18:07.902 --> 00:18:18.982
MATT: Cassandra also steps forward and says, "I
myself do not have any sort of potion of

00:18:18.982 --> 00:18:21.793
"protection. Does anyone have anything which they
could offer?"

00:18:21.793 --> 00:18:26.509
SAM: Yes, hello, hi. I look like your brother but
I'm shorter.

00:18:26.509 --> 00:18:29.349
MATT: Yes, that's right. By the way, everyone is
currently--

00:18:29.349 --> 00:18:31.169
TALIESIN: Currently everybody looks--

00:18:31.169 --> 00:18:36.406
MATT: Like either Percy or Cassandra, thanks to
Scanlan's Seeming, which is really awkward.

00:18:36.406 --> 00:18:41.454
LIAM: (hoarse) Are we going to hold this up for
when we go against the Briarwoods? I think it'll

00:18:41.454 --> 00:18:42.906
be confusing.

00:18:42.906 --> 00:18:50.727
SAM: Yeah, for them. You can have one of my
greater healing potions. Will that suffice?

00:18:50.727 --> 00:18:55.782
MATT: "Certainly, thank you." And she comes
forward and reaches out towards you and you have

00:18:55.782 --> 00:18:58.692
to reach up and put it in her hand because she's
reaching out towards a much taller figure.

00:18:58.692 --> 00:19:01.345
SAM: Oh, I look like a full-size Percy?

00:19:01.345 --> 00:19:04.999
MATT: A little larger. In between.

00:19:04.999 --> 00:19:05.842
SAM: Oh, cool.

00:19:05.842 --> 00:19:07.898
TALIESIN: I throw her one of my commons as well.

00:19:07.898 --> 00:19:13.878
TRAVIS: I have three commons, two greaters, and one
superior. I'm a walking medicine cabinet.

00:19:13.897 --> 00:19:15.194
MATT: You are.

00:19:15.194 --> 00:19:18.874
SAM: Speaking of looking like Percy and Cassandra.
Vex.

00:19:18.874 --> 00:19:20.240
LAURA: Huh?

00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:22.355
SAM: That is you, right?

00:19:22.355 --> 00:19:24.487
LAURA: That's me, yes, what?

00:19:24.487 --> 00:19:33.077
SAM: Vex, if you, if you look like Cassandra, you
could conceivably get in front of the Briarwoods

00:19:33.077 --> 00:19:38.522
without them knowing that it's an enemy for a
moment. Maybe long enough to fire off one of

00:19:38.522 --> 00:19:41.438
your-- don't you have some sort of sunbeam arrow
or something?

00:19:41.438 --> 00:19:48.241
LAURA: I have no sunbeam arrow, but I would like
to dip some arrows in some holy oil at this moment

00:19:48.241 --> 00:19:49.564
in time.

00:19:49.564 --> 00:19:50.745
MATT: All right.

00:19:50.745 --> 00:19:55.618
LAURA: I do have potentially an exploding holy
arrow.

00:19:55.618 --> 00:19:58.788
SAM: That would be pretty baller.

00:19:58.788 --> 00:20:00.990
MATT: Is this the one with the question mark?

00:20:00.990 --> 00:20:04.879
LAURA: No, this is a normal one, and then I have a
question mark, as well.

00:20:04.879 --> 00:20:06.387
MATT: Do you want to dip them both?

00:20:06.387 --> 00:20:07.699
LAURA: Fuck yes, I do.

00:20:07.699 --> 00:20:10.903
MATT: (laughs) Okay. You have two more uses of
your holy oil, I believe, right?

00:20:10.968 --> 00:20:17.236
LAURA: Yes. Well, no. Each thing takes three
arrows, so I can do six arrows altogether.

00:20:17.236 --> 00:20:19.237
MATT: You're using it all right now?

00:20:19.237 --> 00:20:21.449
TRAVIS: Will it wear off?

00:20:21.449 --> 00:20:22.938
MATT: It lasts for an hour.

00:20:22.938 --> 00:20:25.506
LAURA: Are we going to get there?

00:20:25.506 --> 00:20:28.239
SAM: I don't know. We could fight them in five
minutes.

00:20:28.239 --> 00:20:31.048
LAURA: I want to do it right before we walk in the
room, Matt.

00:20:31.048 --> 00:20:32.683
MATT: It's up to you. You can hold off.

00:20:32.683 --> 00:20:35.007
LIAM: We don't see a ziggurat yet.

00:20:35.007 --> 00:20:41.185
TALIESIN: Let's start making our way down there,
and I can't believe I'm going to say this, but

00:20:41.185 --> 00:20:43.689
we'll have Vax scout ahead.

00:20:43.689 --> 00:20:47.204
SAM: Don't do anything!

00:20:47.204 --> 00:20:52.104
LAURA: Don't do anything. Look. Don't touch.

00:20:52.104 --> 00:20:55.036
TALIESIN: Vax, we've discussed our new password.
Do you remember the new password?

00:20:55.036 --> 00:20:56.685
SAM: Which is?

00:20:56.685 --> 00:20:58.076
LAURA: Is there something different?

00:20:58.076 --> 00:20:59.670
LIAM: Is it Candyland? No, I don't remember.

00:20:59.670 --> 00:21:03.465
TALIESIN: It's now "Jenga, one one-thousand, two
one-thousand, three one-thousand, four

00:21:03.465 --> 00:21:07.734
"one-thousand, five one-thousand, six one-thousand,
seven one-thousand, eight one-thousand, nine

00:21:07.734 --> 00:21:09.353
"one-thousand, ten."

00:21:09.353 --> 00:21:13.559
LIAM: I just got flicked in the nuts. I'm not
doing that. I'll say jenga.

00:21:13.559 --> 00:21:16.488
LAURA: And then wait.

00:21:16.488 --> 00:21:24.579
LIAM: Yeah, I'll wait. So long as no more of your
siblings are in danger. I did do it for reasons.

00:21:24.579 --> 00:21:25.823
TALIESIN: We know.

00:21:25.823 --> 00:21:29.730
LIAM: You know because I told you.

00:21:29.730 --> 00:21:33.880
TALIESIN: Yes. I consider the matter settled.

00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:37.995
LIAM: I don't know exactly what was going to
happen, but I saw a blade against your sister's

00:21:37.995 --> 00:21:42.288
throat. I would hope you would do the same for my
sister if you were to see the same thing.

00:21:42.288 --> 00:21:43.322
TALIESIN: Yes.

00:21:43.322 --> 00:21:44.616
LAURA: Of course he would.

00:21:44.616 --> 00:21:47.071
TALIESIN: But mostly because I fear her.

00:21:47.071 --> 00:21:51.665
LIAM: Scanlan, back me up. If you were to turn
into some sort of three-horned beast and go

00:21:51.665 --> 00:21:59.360
running into a house full of enemies, we would
give him a similar talking-to, correct?

00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:02.431
SAM: That would never happen. I'm more measured
than all of you.

00:22:02.431 --> 00:22:06.098
TALIESIN: We don't actually believe that he will
listen to sense.

00:22:06.098 --> 00:22:07.942
SAM: I'm Percy.

00:22:07.942 --> 00:22:11.623
(laughter)

00:22:11.623 --> 00:22:15.670
TALIESIN: We just can't waste our breath, really.

00:22:15.670 --> 00:22:17.261
LIAM: Scanlan, shut up.

00:22:17.261 --> 00:22:20.510
TRAVIS: Attunement. How long does that take?

00:22:20.510 --> 00:22:21.817
MATT: A short rest.

00:22:21.817 --> 00:22:24.812
TALIESIN: This is going to be a very complicated
evening.

00:22:24.812 --> 00:22:26.094
TRAVIS: Should we take a short rest?

00:22:26.094 --> 00:22:27.263
TALIESIN: We just did.

00:22:27.263 --> 00:22:28.252
TRAVIS: We did?

00:22:28.252 --> 00:22:29.423
LAURA: Oh, we did!

00:22:29.423 --> 00:22:31.293
MATT: If you wanted to attune to something during
that short rest, you can.

00:22:31.293 --> 00:22:33.743
TRAVIS: Can I attune to Boots of Levitation?

00:22:33.743 --> 00:22:34.933
MATT: If you'd like to, yeah.

00:22:34.933 --> 00:22:36.021
TRAVIS: I would like to.

00:22:36.021 --> 00:22:36.950
MATT: Okay.

00:22:36.950 --> 00:22:39.065
LIAM: We just rested for 30 minutes?

00:22:39.065 --> 00:22:40.472
MATT: Roughly 30 minutes, yeah.

00:22:40.472 --> 00:22:42.754
LIAM: How would everyone feel about another seven
and a half hours?

00:22:42.754 --> 00:22:44.823
LAURA: We can't sleep in this--

00:22:44.823 --> 00:22:51.943
SAM: Our meal is still active, as well. We need
the benefits of that. Plus, there is a rebellion

00:22:51.943 --> 00:22:57.209
going on. It's been, what, an hour? Two hours?
They're probably mostly dead by now.

00:22:57.209 --> 00:22:59.901
MARISHA: That's possibly very true, actually.

00:22:59.901 --> 00:23:00.928
TALIESIN: Cassandra?

00:23:00.928 --> 00:23:02.010
MATT: "Yes?"

00:23:02.010 --> 00:23:05.664
TALIESIN: In your opinion, who's the more
dangerous target?

00:23:05.664 --> 00:23:15.679
MATT: She gets distant for a second, thinking, and
haphazardly pulls the hair over her ear and rubs

00:23:15.679 --> 00:23:22.722
her armor in a nervous way. Looks over out of the
side of her eyes to you and says, "They're both

00:23:22.722 --> 00:23:32.735
"dangerous for different reasons. Separately, Sylas
is dangerous because of his unnatural nature. I've

00:23:32.735 --> 00:23:40.785
"seen him turn arguments and opposing sides into
friendships in but an instant. He has some sort of

00:23:40.785 --> 00:23:46.879
"power over the mind of those he looks to. That in
itself is a danger, not to mention his other

00:23:46.879 --> 00:23:55.330
"capabilities. I've only seen him use it twice, but
that blade he carries is as dark as he is.

00:23:55.330 --> 00:24:04.494
"That being said, Lady Briarwood, Delilah, she
carries magic far more powerful than I've seen.

00:24:04.494 --> 00:24:12.544
"She on her own was able to create, run, and rule
each of these sentries that run about the entire

00:24:12.544 --> 00:24:21.314
"city. She had half of the entire castle staffed
with long-dead individuals. None questioned her.

00:24:21.314 --> 00:24:27.423
"I've never seen her in battle, but I sense there
is far more to her abilities than I've seen.

00:24:27.423 --> 00:24:37.956
"The two of them together are driven-- more so
than the affiliation to this Whispered One they

00:24:37.956 --> 00:24:46.820
"talk of, they're driven by one thing, and that's
their affection for each other. As long as they

00:24:46.820 --> 00:24:53.413
"are together, who knows what they're capable of."

00:24:53.413 --> 00:24:54.700
LAURA: So we split them up?

00:24:54.700 --> 00:24:56.723
TRAVIS: Yeah, we've got to divide and conquer this
shit.

00:24:56.723 --> 00:24:58.225
TALIESIN: If we can.

00:24:58.225 --> 00:25:01.029
TRAVIS: If we can.

00:25:01.029 --> 00:25:02.556
MARISHA: Cassandra.

00:25:02.556 --> 00:25:03.483
MATT: "Yes?"

00:25:03.483 --> 00:25:09.323
MARISHA: Has there been any instance where the two
have separated in the recent months, that you can

00:25:09.323 --> 00:25:12.043
imagine or remember?

00:25:12.125 --> 00:25:21.450
MATT: "Most of the ziggurat construction happens
during the evening, when Sylas is not resting. And

00:25:21.450 --> 00:25:31.690
"for the most part they journey together-- for the
past month, at least. No, I haven't seen them

00:25:31.690 --> 00:25:33.224
"apart, really."

00:25:33.224 --> 00:25:35.666
MARISHA: Can you think of any reason why they
would separate?

00:25:35.666 --> 00:25:41.058
MATT: "Not unless something in the sun required
their attention."

00:25:41.058 --> 00:25:45.478
MARISHA: Something sudden that required their
attention.

00:25:45.478 --> 00:25:46.683
MATT: "In the sun."

00:25:46.683 --> 00:25:48.080
MARISHA: In the sun?

00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:50.977
MATT: "Sylas does not appear to like being
outside."

00:25:50.977 --> 00:26:00.386
TRAVIS: Yeah, one thing. Do we want to take the
battle to them down here? Or do we want to try and

00:26:00.386 --> 00:26:03.056
lure them outside?

00:26:03.056 --> 00:26:07.062
LIAM: I think we would definitely prefer them
outside, but what would draw them out?

00:26:07.062 --> 00:26:08.506
I do not know.

00:26:08.506 --> 00:26:15.921
LAURA: What if we used Seeming and made one of us
seem like Lady Briarwood?

00:26:15.921 --> 00:26:18.411
TALIESIN: I think they would see through that.

00:26:18.411 --> 00:26:19.423
LAURA: Yes?

00:26:19.423 --> 00:26:22.159
TRAVIS: They saw through the disguise at the table
back in Emon.

00:26:22.159 --> 00:26:30.947
SAM: Just to point this out before we go in and
kill ourselves. We have evidence now. We could

00:26:30.947 --> 00:26:35.254
abandon this whole thing. Go back and fight our
day in court.

00:26:35.254 --> 00:26:41.198
TALIESIN: I want to see what they're building down
there. And I worry that it would be dangerous.

00:26:41.198 --> 00:26:46.493
MARISHA: Plus, we'd just abandon this entire
revolution that we caused?

00:26:46.493 --> 00:26:51.163
LIAM: People are putting their lives on the line.
Plus, Uriel is suspect now. He's been corrupted;

00:26:51.163 --> 00:26:54.734
he is not trustworthy. There's no point going back
to him.

00:26:54.734 --> 00:26:59.996
TALIESIN: I can't leave again until this is taken
care of.

00:26:59.996 --> 00:27:05.128
SAM: Right, that was a stupid suggestion,
Keyleth.

00:27:05.128 --> 00:27:10.878
TRAVIS: Keyleth, come on, we've got to stay.

00:27:10.878 --> 00:27:14.584
SAM: We're all Seemed differently; it's very
strange.

00:27:14.584 --> 00:27:18.150
TRAVIS: I'm really disappointed, Keyleth.

00:27:18.150 --> 00:27:28.203
LIAM: Cassandra, I want to say something a little
frank. I'm very happy that we've found you. I'm

00:27:28.203 --> 00:27:34.598
very happy that Percival and you have been
reunited. We have been burned very badly in the

00:27:34.598 --> 00:27:44.203
past by seeming allies. And I am sure you are in
your right mind. But past experience has taught us

00:27:44.203 --> 00:27:53.443
to be very careful. And we are all watching you.
For signs of corruption or control. I want to

00:27:53.443 --> 00:27:59.133
believe you are in control of your faculties. I do
not fully trust you are and I think, just letting

00:27:59.133 --> 00:28:08.312
you know that a knife could hit your back as soon
as the slightest misstep happened, is maybe enough

00:28:08.312 --> 00:28:11.968
to ensure some safety for this group.

00:28:11.968 --> 00:28:22.833
MATT: "Of course. It is true I have been living
here, at least in this castle with them, for the

00:28:22.833 --> 00:28:29.172
"past three years. Not, not of choice, of course.
And were I in your position,

00:28:29.172 --> 00:28:31.704
"would think the same."

00:28:31.704 --> 00:28:38.926
LIAM: According to Percival, they filled you with
arrows. What happened?

00:28:38.926 --> 00:28:52.280
MATT: "Well, I was near death. I was recovered by
the father that runs the temple of Pelor and a few

00:28:52.280 --> 00:29:02.053
"other individuals who had fled the city at the
time. I was as far-- as I was concerned, I was gone.

00:29:02.104 --> 00:29:13.538
"But they nursed me back to health. Slowly. Over
time. I was, for the better part, useless as an

00:29:13.538 --> 00:29:20.531
"individual for about six months. And even to this
day, I have a bit of a wheeze when I expend

00:29:20.531 --> 00:29:29.880
"myself, but Father Reynal made sure that I was in
good health. And that was when I learned truly

00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:37.920
"what had become of the city in my restoration. And
it was there that we began to speak of the early

00:29:37.920 --> 00:29:47.749
"talks of rebellion, here in Whitestone. Me being
still alive was enough of a beacon, for those who

00:29:47.749 --> 00:29:56.219
"knew, for us to put together our first attempt to
fight out from under their rule. And it was

00:29:56.219 --> 00:30:05.437
"marked. They knew every step we took. Many lives
were lost, but in that fray, they recognized me.

00:30:05.437 --> 00:30:13.952
"They didn't know I was alive, either. I guess they
saw the importance of keeping me under their lock

00:30:13.952 --> 00:30:17.784
"and key as a way of crushing whatever hope those
who still lived here had."

00:30:17.784 --> 00:30:26.588
LIAM: Why not hang you from that tree in the
center of town like they did so many others?

00:30:26.588 --> 00:30:33.114
MATT: "That would have certainly made a statement.
There were many days when they first took me

00:30:33.114 --> 00:30:41.300
"captive I would have welcomed that. But in that
time we planned that first rebellion, I saw fire

00:30:41.300 --> 00:30:51.032
"in the eyes of my people. Brighter than any I had
witnessed in my youth. I saw their love for my

00:30:51.032 --> 00:30:59.840
"family. I saw the intent of these people to take
back what was theirs from this corrupt force, and

00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:07.812
"I knew that I had a part to play. If they choose
to leave me alive, as much as they try and sway my

00:31:07.812 --> 00:31:13.506
"interests, it also brought me close to them. I
watched them. I could see what they were planning.

00:31:13.506 --> 00:31:20.773
"Try and gather details of this construct they're
working on beneath the city and feed this

00:31:20.773 --> 00:31:31.609
"information to those who I knew were still true
and behind the de Rolo family name. I don't know

00:31:31.609 --> 00:31:33.687
"what I can say to offer you more than that."

00:31:33.687 --> 00:31:35.559
LIAM: I don't think there's anything you can say.

00:31:35.559 --> 00:31:37.423
LAURA: (whispers) Can I insight check her?

00:31:37.423 --> 00:31:43.686
LIAM: I want you back in my friend's life, but I'm
sorry, I do not trust you. And I and the others

00:31:43.686 --> 00:31:45.435
will be watching.

00:31:45.435 --> 00:31:46.539
LAURA: (whispers) 21.

00:31:46.539 --> 00:31:56.477
MATT: 21? Okay. Looking, every word that comes out
of her mouth comes with conviction, comes from a

00:31:56.477 --> 00:32:04.917
look of a person who's recalling a painful memory.
There is nothing that belies any deceit.

00:32:04.917 --> 00:32:09.959
SAM: Onward.

00:32:09.959 --> 00:32:11.544
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:32:11.544 --> 00:32:12.948
LAURA: And upward.

00:32:12.948 --> 00:32:15.939
MARISHA: Are we going to try and separate these
two? Is that the plan?

00:32:15.939 --> 00:32:19.795
TALIESIN: I think we're going to take the lay of
the land first. See what we're up against.

00:32:19.795 --> 00:32:23.434
TRAVIS: Not a bad idea with Cass, but we'll see.

00:32:23.434 --> 00:32:24.790
TALIESIN: Vax?

00:32:24.790 --> 00:32:28.669
LIAM: All right, so I'm going to go ahead through
the hole.

00:32:28.669 --> 00:32:30.283
LAURA: Should I stealth with you?

00:32:30.283 --> 00:32:32.678
LIAM: Sure, you're very good at that now because
of my gift to you.

00:32:32.678 --> 00:32:33.795
LAURA: Hey!

00:32:33.795 --> 00:32:38.745
MATT: Hey, there you go. You guys are both going
to stealth ahead? Twins, side by side. All right,

00:32:38.745 --> 00:32:41.306
go ahead and roll stealth checks. You get
advantage, Laura.

00:32:41.306 --> 00:32:44.566
LAURA: I get advantage because of the gold dress.

00:32:44.566 --> 00:32:47.232
MARISHA: The sparkles are magical.

00:32:47.232 --> 00:32:48.620
TALIESIN: Magic sparkles.

00:32:48.620 --> 00:32:50.107
LIAM: 32.

00:32:50.107 --> 00:32:51.819
TALIESIN: It does look like mithril, doesn't it?

00:32:51.819 --> 00:32:52.822
LAURA: 23.

00:32:52.822 --> 00:32:55.752
MATT: All right. The two of you go ahead. Can I
have a marching order here?

00:32:55.752 --> 00:32:57.502
LAURA: Him first.

00:32:57.502 --> 00:33:00.842
LIAM: Me first, yeah. Her dress sparkles too
much.

00:33:00.842 --> 00:33:02.592
MATT: Trinket stays with the rest of the party, I
assume.

00:33:02.592 --> 00:33:03.789
LAURA: Yes, Trinket stays.

00:33:03.789 --> 00:33:06.318
MATT: All right. Who's going to be towards the
front of this traveling pack?

00:33:06.318 --> 00:33:07.796
LIAM: We're going way ahead.

00:33:07.796 --> 00:33:10.042
MATT: Right, but everyone else is following
behind, though.

00:33:10.042 --> 00:33:12.531
TRAVIS: I'll be in the front. Meat shield.

00:33:12.531 --> 00:33:13.703
MATT: All righty.

00:33:13.703 --> 00:33:15.349
SAM: I will be right behind the meat shield.

00:33:15.349 --> 00:33:16.769
TALIESIN: I will be right behind the--

00:33:16.769 --> 00:33:20.819
LIAM: Percy number four.

00:33:20.819 --> 00:33:25.558
LAURA: Trinket follows Percy. He's following
Percy.

00:33:25.558 --> 00:33:27.491
MATT: Okay, Trinket's following Percy.

00:33:27.491 --> 00:33:29.277
MARISHA: Following up the ranks with Trinket, I
guess.

00:33:29.277 --> 00:33:35.183
MATT: All right. And as soon as you enter the
cavern and begin stepping forward into the tunnel,

00:33:35.183 --> 00:33:42.342
there's a flash of light right before you for a
second, blinding you, and you instinctively step

00:33:42.342 --> 00:33:47.704
back and pull your daggers out before you realize
the flash is now a glowing symbol on your hand.

00:33:47.704 --> 00:33:53.970
The crest of Sarenrae that's been stitched into
your glove is now pulsing with an energy.

00:33:53.970 --> 00:33:56.720
LIAM: Hi, Pike.

00:33:56.720 --> 00:34:06.245
MATT: And you hear for a second, call out, Pike's
voice ring through the darkness, and you see

00:34:06.245 --> 00:34:14.345
before you, out of the shadow, out of the
blackness that is before you in the cavern, a

00:34:14.345 --> 00:34:17.935
small gnomish hand reach out for you.

00:34:17.935 --> 00:34:19.652
ASHLEY: Are you all still there?

00:34:19.652 --> 00:34:21.017
LAURA: Pike!

00:34:21.017 --> 00:34:29.979
LIAM: I take her hand. I take your hand, Pike, and
I kneel down, and I press the back of her hand to

00:34:29.979 --> 00:34:33.146
my forehead and hold it there for a moment.

00:34:33.146 --> 00:34:40.723
MATT: As you do, the glow from the glove begins to
spread from your hand across, and all of you guys

00:34:40.723 --> 00:34:51.829
see materializing out of the darkness Pike's form
slowly unravel into this shadowed area into this

00:34:51.829 --> 00:34:56.588
glowing beacon of her holy form that you
previously traveled with, as Pike is now once

00:34:56.588 --> 00:35:01.286
again brought to this point of clarity here
beneath the castle Whitestone.

00:35:01.286 --> 00:35:05.057
TRAVIS: I run over and I knock Vax out of the way
and I pick up Pike and give her a big hug.

00:35:05.057 --> 00:35:06.466
LIAM: My nut!

00:35:06.466 --> 00:35:10.738
TRAVIS: Oh, Pike, I'm so glad to see you!

00:35:10.738 --> 00:35:15.412
ASHLEY: Grog, but you don't look like Grog.

00:35:15.412 --> 00:35:19.911
TRAVIS: What? Oh. No. (whispers) It's me.

00:35:19.911 --> 00:35:25.053
ASHLEY: Is everybody Percy and Cassandra?

00:35:25.053 --> 00:35:26.140
ALL: Yes.

00:35:26.140 --> 00:35:27.330
LAURA: Except for you, darling.

00:35:27.330 --> 00:35:32.557
MATT: It's very weird. You're a tiny gnome in
armor, and everyone else looks like Percy and a

00:35:32.557 --> 00:35:34.415
woman you've never seen before in your life.

00:35:34.415 --> 00:35:35.979
TALIESIN: Bear-Percy is especially disturbing.

00:35:35.979 --> 00:35:49.166
MATT: Yeah. This giant rotund Percy on his hands
and legs, just (bear noises).

00:35:49.166 --> 00:35:50.525
LAURA: That is awkward.

00:35:50.525 --> 00:35:58.458
MATT: It's a very strange visual, and you're very
confused momentarily.

00:35:58.458 --> 00:36:00.923
ASHLEY: I give Percy-Trink some ear scratches.

00:36:00.923 --> 00:36:03.205
LAURA: He likes it.

00:36:03.205 --> 00:36:06.457
MATT: (bear noises)

00:36:06.457 --> 00:36:12.817
SAM: I run over and I say, Pike, Pike, what
happened, you disappeared before, but now you're

00:36:12.817 --> 00:36:15.725
back. Are you here to stay? What's going on?

00:36:15.725 --> 00:36:22.627
ASHLEY: I'm here to stay for as long as I can.
It's very hard to stay in this form, especially

00:36:22.627 --> 00:36:33.705
when this place is very dark, and sometimes I just
get pulled away, so I'm going to

00:36:33.705 --> 00:36:35.596
stay as long as I can.

00:36:35.596 --> 00:36:38.461
SAM: We're so happy to have you here.

00:36:38.461 --> 00:36:39.946
MARISHA: So happy to have you here.

00:36:39.946 --> 00:36:46.378
ASHLEY: I'm so happy to be here. How are you, how
are you guys, are you okay, where are you at in

00:36:46.378 --> 00:36:48.212
terms of health?

00:36:48.212 --> 00:36:49.608
SAM: We're all healthy.

00:36:49.608 --> 00:36:50.651
ASHLEY: Okay.

00:36:50.651 --> 00:36:54.871
TRAVIS: Vax is minus a hit point because I hit him
in the nuts. Hah!

00:36:54.871 --> 00:36:56.770
ASHLEY: (laughs) Oh, Grog.

00:36:56.770 --> 00:37:06.034
SAM: And we have a new member. Well, a new
traveling companion. This is Cassandra.

00:37:06.034 --> 00:37:07.421
TALIESIN: Cassandra de Rolo.

00:37:07.421 --> 00:37:09.325
LAURA: The actual Cassandra.

00:37:09.325 --> 00:37:18.557
ASHLEY: I go over and put my hand out and hold her
hand and say, it's so very nice to finally meet you.

00:37:18.557 --> 00:37:24.826
MATT: She takes your hand and looks down curiously
at this tiny gnome that seems to have apparated

00:37:24.826 --> 00:37:32.858
out of the shadows and gives you a curious look
and a big smile creeps across her face. "It is my

00:37:32.858 --> 00:37:42.085
"pleasure to have good people around me for once.
Pleasure to meet you, young gnome." Which is funny

00:37:42.085 --> 00:37:48.083
coming from her, because she's technically younger
than you. She looks hardened, but she's younger

00:37:48.083 --> 00:37:49.355
than you.

00:37:49.355 --> 00:37:54.308
LAURA: Well. Shall we?

00:37:54.308 --> 00:37:55.950
TALIESIN: Now that we're together.

00:37:55.950 --> 00:37:57.360
LAURA: Shall we keep moving?

00:37:57.360 --> 00:37:59.057
TRAVIS: Now we're definitely going to kick some
ass.

00:37:59.057 --> 00:38:01.649
SAM: With Pike with us, we can do anything.

00:38:01.649 --> 00:38:03.427
MARISHA: Is she glowing?

00:38:03.427 --> 00:38:09.937
MATT: Pike is giving low candlelight around her,
so you're going to want to keep her towards the

00:38:09.937 --> 00:38:11.119
back, probably.

00:38:11.119 --> 00:38:13.251
LAURA: Pike always ruins stealth.

00:38:13.251 --> 00:38:15.117
(laughter)

00:38:15.117 --> 00:38:17.287
LAURA: Even when she's a ghostly form.

00:38:17.287 --> 00:38:20.706
SAM: Can we hang a sheet over her or something?

00:38:20.706 --> 00:38:26.023
MATT: You can, it'll be like throwing a t-shirt
over your bedroom light. It'll just be a nice

00:38:26.023 --> 00:38:30.048
atmospheric Chinese lantern.

00:38:30.048 --> 00:38:31.370
LAURA: Ooh, mood lighting.

00:38:31.370 --> 00:38:32.472
MATT: There you go.

00:38:32.472 --> 00:38:38.487
LIAM: I place my Sarenrae hand on her shoulder and
say, you're here because she willed you to be

00:38:38.487 --> 00:38:48.141
here, she knows that we need you. Now please hide
behind obese Percival. And I pat my sister on the

00:38:48.141 --> 00:38:50.880
shoulder and head back into the darkness.

00:38:50.880 --> 00:38:55.532
MATT: Okay. So as Pike comes to the back, smiling
at everybody, she joins the back ranks of Keyleth

00:38:55.532 --> 00:39:02.666
and Trinket. Actually, probably behind Percy.
Cassandra's going to be right there. Flying V

00:39:02.666 --> 00:39:05.537
formation. And you guys continue down this
tunnel.

00:39:05.537 --> 00:39:07.278
LAURA: Check for traps.

00:39:07.278 --> 00:39:09.613
LIAM: Yeah. Perception all that shit down.

00:39:09.613 --> 00:39:10.600
MATT: Yeah.

00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:15.092
LAURA: Yeah, perception. Oh yeah, I should do it
too. Hold on.

00:39:15.092 --> 00:39:18.938
LIAM: 20 for me.

00:39:18.938 --> 00:39:22.036
LAURA: Yeah, I know, right? 18 for me.

00:39:22.036 --> 00:39:31.535
MATT: All right. You guys continue on this slowly
descending tunnel for about ten minutes or so

00:39:31.535 --> 00:39:43.314
before you see it divide to the left very heavily
and then continue forward. There's still no light

00:39:43.314 --> 00:39:49.836
source here and so you're relying on your
darkvision to continue, but there's the switchback

00:39:49.836 --> 00:39:52.189
to the left and the one that continues forward.

00:39:52.189 --> 00:39:57.132
LIAM: I lean over to my sister and say, I'm not
going to do anything, I'm just going to look 50

00:39:57.132 --> 00:39:58.051
feet down--

00:39:58.051 --> 00:40:01.448
LAURA: How about wait a fucking second and let me
look for footprints?

00:40:01.448 --> 00:40:02.948
LIAM: All right.

00:40:02.948 --> 00:40:05.792
LAURA: Can I look for footprints?

00:40:05.792 --> 00:40:07.272
MATT: You can. Make a survival check.

00:40:07.272 --> 00:40:16.458
LAURA: Okay. I don't know which one to use. I'm so
nervous. Okay, let's do this one. That was a bad

00:40:16.458 --> 00:40:19.003
one. I'm perceptioning?

00:40:19.003 --> 00:40:20.791
MATT: This is a survival.

00:40:20.791 --> 00:40:25.907
LAURA: Oh. Well, it's the same. That is a 16.

00:40:25.907 --> 00:40:34.576
MATT: 16, okay. You get down and inspect the area.
You actually pull out a small bit of torch pith

00:40:34.576 --> 00:40:39.621
and light it a bit just to get a little light
across this one intersection briefly. There are

00:40:39.621 --> 00:40:44.336
footprints back and forth in all ways, but many of
them have been, at least the footprints coming

00:40:44.336 --> 00:40:49.479
from, and the last footprints were coming from
this tunnel to your immediate left, were from a

00:40:49.479 --> 00:41:01.537
while back. The fresher footprints, fresh as of
four hours, continue on down that way. You do

00:41:01.537 --> 00:41:06.104
notice that the smell of the air itself is, you
notice this as well as you're inspecting, the air

00:41:06.104 --> 00:41:14.061
down here has a very acrid, sharp scent anyway, a
hint of chemical. It seems to be getting stronger

00:41:14.061 --> 00:41:15.128
to the left.

00:41:15.128 --> 00:41:22.810
LAURA: That's where the acid pits are. Acid.
Briarwoods. Briarwoods?

00:41:22.810 --> 00:41:24.145
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:41:24.145 --> 00:41:34.143
MATT: All right. Continuing to push forward, about
another five minutes or so, keeping track of your

00:41:34.143 --> 00:41:40.819
distance to the castle you're starting to get
towards the outside perimeter of the actual city

00:41:40.819 --> 00:41:48.638
itself. As you're keeping tabs on distance
traveled to that area, you catch, based on your

00:41:48.638 --> 00:41:57.688
last perception roll, there is a portion of the
floor that seems to have some placed crooked

00:41:57.688 --> 00:42:02.078
chunks of stone. You see pieces of broken stone
here and there, things that have fallen out from

00:42:02.078 --> 00:42:06.095
being hauled from the distant dig into wherever
the ziggurat is, but there's one section where it

00:42:06.095 --> 00:42:08.204
appears there's platforms.

00:42:08.204 --> 00:42:09.391
LIAM: Looks a little hinky?

00:42:09.391 --> 00:42:12.063
MATT: It looks like it's deliberately placed, as
opposed to dropped and left there.

00:42:12.063 --> 00:42:20.735
LIAM: I'd like to carefully approach and disarm
anything I can detect or find.

00:42:20.735 --> 00:42:22.977
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and make a check.

00:42:22.977 --> 00:42:24.793
LIAM: Is that thieves' tools?

00:42:24.793 --> 00:42:26.590
MATT: That's thieves' tools, yeah.

00:42:26.590 --> 00:42:28.474
LIAM: That's a 27.

00:42:28.474 --> 00:42:38.878
MATT: Okay. You find two of the large stone slabs
that are part of this discarded sequence here, they

00:42:38.939 --> 00:42:49.358
have beneath them some small magical burst that is
waiting to detonate. You manage to mark it and

00:42:49.358 --> 00:42:56.822
take a couple of other stone pieces to wedge
underneath it to prevent it from depressing onto

00:42:56.822 --> 00:43:00.903
whatever the trigger may be, and note to the rest
of the party to avoid that section.

00:43:00.903 --> 00:43:08.104
LIAM: There's a couple of stones here that I've
marked in the middle of the path. Don't step on

00:43:08.104 --> 00:43:09.585
them, please.

00:43:09.585 --> 00:43:10.828
TALIESIN: Copy.

00:43:10.828 --> 00:43:12.623
TRAVIS: Somebody tell Trinket.

00:43:12.623 --> 00:43:13.831
SAM: And Pike.

00:43:13.831 --> 00:43:15.243
LAURA: He fucking understands signs.

00:43:15.243 --> 00:43:18.904
MARISHA: I'll be in charge of guiding Trinket.

00:43:18.904 --> 00:43:19.874
MATT: Okay.

00:43:19.874 --> 00:43:22.519
LAURA: He listens to you.

00:43:22.519 --> 00:43:26.940
MATT: The awkward large bear-Percy--

00:43:26.940 --> 00:43:28.570
LAURA: They got the message.

00:43:28.570 --> 00:43:34.914
MARISHA: He's still my friend. At least the bear
still loves me.

00:43:34.914 --> 00:43:49.506
MATT: You continue forward for another I'd say 20
minutes. Go ahead and make another

00:43:49.506 --> 00:43:52.758
perception check.

00:43:52.758 --> 00:43:54.856
LIAM: 20.

00:43:54.856 --> 00:43:59.797
LAURA: 21. Again.

00:43:59.797 --> 00:44:07.867
MATT: Okay. Both of you guys, walking forward,
both step out and look down just in time to stop

00:44:07.867 --> 00:44:13.991
your foot from pressing onto what looks to be a
mound of dirt that is, once again, deliberately

00:44:13.991 --> 00:44:19.607
placed and a little more fresh than the rest of
the dust-covered hallway. You can see there's an

00:44:19.607 --> 00:44:24.539
area that is distinctly a different shade of color
based on the lack of dust on top of it, and you

00:44:24.539 --> 00:44:29.090
both stop just in time. Thank you very much. I got
fries.

00:44:29.090 --> 00:44:36.993
LIAM: I give her the universal rogue movement for
scoot back. Yeah, keep going. Ten feet or so. All

00:44:36.993 --> 00:44:41.903
right. I'm going to inspect and try to do the
same. 26.

00:44:41.903 --> 00:44:52.013
MATT: You approach this mound and as soon as you
get close to it, you pull out your tools. You're

00:44:52.013 --> 00:44:58.850
not quite sure how this initially works. And as
you begin to push slightly on the dirt on one

00:44:58.850 --> 00:45:03.220
side, you can see the other side shifts a little
bit from the weight. It's like there's something

00:45:03.220 --> 00:45:12.088
beneath the dirt that has some sort of shifting
property to it and you gather based on the

00:45:12.088 --> 00:45:21.265
way it reacted there is a gas contained beneath
this. To disarm it would be difficult, but you can

00:45:21.348 --> 00:45:28.071
ascertain the nature of its detonation and once
again, you can mark this to not be placed.

00:45:28.071 --> 00:45:30.561
LIAM: Does it take the whole passage?

00:45:30.629 --> 00:45:34.604
MATT: It's right in the center, so it can be
bypassed if you stick directly to the right or

00:45:34.604 --> 00:45:39.298
left and work along the sides. Trinket may be a
little difficult to work on, but we'll make a roll

00:45:39.298 --> 00:45:40.198
for that.

00:45:40.198 --> 00:45:41.209
LAURA: Oh no!

00:45:41.209 --> 00:45:43.027
MATT: What could possibly go wrong?

00:45:43.027 --> 00:45:48.300
LIAM: All right people, we have some gas trapped
under a mound of shit up here.

00:45:48.300 --> 00:45:49.389
SAM: Some gas?

00:45:49.389 --> 00:45:51.461
LAURA: Yeah it smells like Grog, so avoid it.

00:45:51.461 --> 00:45:58.919
LIAM: Something bad. I'm going to stay here, I'd
like you all to bring up the rear, and Kiki, bring

00:45:59.135 --> 00:46:07.338
the bear. Bring my nephew up, and I'd like
everyone to pass ahead, and my sister and I will

00:46:07.338 --> 00:46:09.730
get Trinket up behind you all.

00:46:09.730 --> 00:46:14.065
TRAVIS: I have a question. How are we marking
these traps?

00:46:14.065 --> 00:46:20.004
LIAM: Chalk. The last one was marked with chalk.
This one I'm just standing in front of.

00:46:20.004 --> 00:46:26.282
TRAVIS: We're coming across a lot of these. If we
need to make a quick escape, it might be a

00:46:26.282 --> 00:46:27.201
problem.

00:46:27.201 --> 00:46:29.421
SAM: If we're going back out the way we came in?

00:46:29.421 --> 00:46:30.486
TRAVIS: In a hurry.

00:46:30.486 --> 00:46:32.237
TALIESIN: We'll just have to remember.

00:46:32.237 --> 00:46:33.647
TRAVIS: Oh yeah.

00:46:33.647 --> 00:46:35.635
MARISHA: Hopefully, we won't be in a
hurry.

00:46:35.635 --> 00:46:37.985
SAM: Well we'll just have Trinket run first.

00:46:38.069 --> 00:46:42.340
LIAM: I'm sure you've got something in that bag of
yours that we can plop in front of this. For now,

00:46:42.340 --> 00:46:43.644
let's just get past it.

00:46:43.644 --> 00:46:56.858
MATT: All right, so you each make your way around
this. When it comes to Trinket's side, I'll say

00:46:56.908 --> 00:47:00.874
for you because he'll probably need a little help
making his way across so go ahead and just make a

00:47:00.874 --> 00:47:05.472
dexterity check for Trinket with advantage, with
the aid from the party.

00:47:05.472 --> 00:47:09.581
LAURA: Okay, that's not good. Eight?

00:47:09.581 --> 00:47:12.121
MATT: Eight? Okay.

00:47:12.121 --> 00:47:12.988
LIAM: Plus anything?

00:47:12.988 --> 00:47:13.787
LAURA: Nope!

00:47:13.787 --> 00:47:14.690
MARISHA: That's for Trinket?

00:47:14.690 --> 00:47:15.433
LAURA: Yeah.

00:47:15.433 --> 00:47:17.125
MATT: Okay, so who's helping Trinket?

00:47:17.125 --> 00:47:21.110
LIAM: I am. We are, I assume.

00:47:21.110 --> 00:47:22.382
TRAVIS: I'll help Trinket.

00:47:22.382 --> 00:47:28.546
TALIESIN: I'll also say, if this was a gas trap, I
would probably throw my mask on before passing it,

00:47:28.546 --> 00:47:29.792
as well.

00:47:29.792 --> 00:47:31.086
TRAVIS: I'll help Trinket.

00:47:31.086 --> 00:47:33.276
MATT: Okay, so just you, Grog?

00:47:33.276 --> 00:47:34.530
TRAVIS: Just me.

00:47:34.530 --> 00:47:43.215
MATT: Okay, as everyone continues pushing forward,
you reach out, helping Trinket get along.

00:47:43.215 --> 00:47:49.416
Trinket's pushing up the side of the cavern, claws
scraping on the side of the wall. Foot slips,

00:47:49.416 --> 00:47:57.591
slams into the mound of dirt, at which point, the
mound depresses and then (explosion) bursts open

00:47:57.591 --> 00:48:03.362
into a 20 by 20-foot gas cloud.

00:48:03.362 --> 00:48:10.494
MARISHA: Can I cast Gust of Wind really quick and
push it back down the hallway?

00:48:10.494 --> 00:48:14.386
MATT: You can start doing that because it is a
lingering cloud effect. Regardless, I need you and

00:48:14.386 --> 00:48:16.734
Trinket to both make a constitution save.

00:48:16.734 --> 00:48:22.917
TRAVIS: Yes! 21! Nope, 20

00:48:22.917 --> 00:48:25.035
MATT: Laura, can you roll a constitution save for
Trinket?

00:48:25.035 --> 00:48:28.857
LAURA: (nervous laugh) Yeah--

00:48:28.938 --> 00:48:30.032
TRAVIS: 17!

00:48:30.032 --> 00:48:32.685
LAURA: Just regular?

00:48:32.685 --> 00:48:34.592
MATT: Just a regular constitution save.

00:48:34.592 --> 00:48:35.595
LAURA: Seven.

00:48:35.595 --> 00:48:43.904
MATT: Seven? Okay. You suffer six points of poison
damage, Trinket suffers 12 points of poison

00:48:43.904 --> 00:48:44.936
damage.

00:48:44.936 --> 00:48:49.610
SAM: Grog, you suffer no poison damage. We had our
meal.

00:48:49.610 --> 00:48:50.964
TRAVIS: Heroes' Feast!

00:48:50.964 --> 00:48:52.337
LAURA: And Trinket ate it, too!

00:48:52.337 --> 00:48:54.098
MARISHA: That's true!

00:48:54.098 --> 00:48:55.692
LAURA: We're immune to poison?

00:48:55.692 --> 00:48:57.664
MARISHA: We're immune to fear and poison.

00:48:57.664 --> 00:49:00.264
LAURA: (gasps) That's amazing!

00:49:00.264 --> 00:49:07.394
MATT: As the cloud begins to fill the area, you
breathe it in and there's that reactionary point

00:49:07.394 --> 00:49:12.428
of like, "Shit, get Trinket out of there!" and
then you realize the harshness of the toxin

00:49:12.428 --> 00:49:18.806
doesn't seem to be affecting your system. There is
some element of the "holy shit it's delicious"

00:49:18.806 --> 00:49:25.726
feast you guys had that is keeping the toxins at
bay from entering your system.

00:49:25.726 --> 00:49:28.523
TRAVIS: I spent the last few years building up an
immunity to iocane powder.

00:49:28.523 --> 00:49:30.256
(laughter)

00:49:30.256 --> 00:49:33.400
MARISHA: Also, doesn't your belt of Dwarvenkind
have something like that?

00:49:33.400 --> 00:49:34.264
TRAVIS: Nope.

00:49:34.264 --> 00:49:37.028
MARISHA: No? Okay, never mind.

00:49:37.028 --> 00:49:40.597
LAURA: He just grows a beard. You have advantage
on charisma?

00:49:40.597 --> 00:49:43.224
TRAVIS: I have resistance against poison damage.

00:49:43.224 --> 00:49:45.308
LAURA: You have advantage on persuasion checks.

00:49:45.388 --> 00:49:46.297
TRAVIS: I know.

00:49:46.297 --> 00:49:47.667
LAURA: That's awesome.

00:49:47.667 --> 00:49:49.953
MATT: You take half poison damage whenever you do
take poison damage.

00:49:49.953 --> 00:49:52.885
LAURA: Oh, where did Pike go?

00:49:52.885 --> 00:49:57.465
SAM: No Pike! The evil of this place is making it
hard to maintain her connection.

00:49:57.465 --> 00:49:59.488
MARISHA: I know it's hard. It's deep underground.

00:49:59.488 --> 00:50:01.003
LIAM: Oh!

00:50:01.003 --> 00:50:02.813
MARISHA: Hey!

00:50:02.813 --> 00:50:06.412
ASHLEY: This astral projection is very hard to
hold.

00:50:06.412 --> 00:50:08.197
(laughter)

00:50:08.197 --> 00:50:11.765
MATT: That's all right.

00:50:11.765 --> 00:50:13.764
TALIESIN: We live in an age of miracles and
wonders.

00:50:13.764 --> 00:50:16.754
MATT: So as you guys pass under this cloud, you--

00:50:16.754 --> 00:50:18.950
ASHLEY: The connection is just not very strong.

00:50:18.950 --> 00:50:25.647
MATT: That's all right, it's much better now.
Keyleth, you push the toxin cloud back and hit it

00:50:25.716 --> 00:50:30.061
off to the side, pushing it down the same tunnel
that the acid section was. It'll take you a while

00:50:30.061 --> 00:50:32.757
to get it back there, but you can just leave it
lingering in the tunnel if you'd like.

00:50:32.757 --> 00:50:34.642
MARISHA: No, it's fine. I'll just leave it. It's
fine.

00:50:34.642 --> 00:50:40.063
MATT: Okay. It seems to be pervasive for now. It
may eventually fade or sink into the earth, but

00:50:40.063 --> 00:50:48.905
it'll take a while for that to happen. But you
move past this trap. You continue forward and the

00:50:48.905 --> 00:50:57.643
descent grows steadily more and more steep at this
point. What was like a relative decline has now

00:50:57.643 --> 00:51:02.268
gotten to the point where some of you have to get up
against the wall as you step down, not to the

00:51:02.268 --> 00:51:06.338
point where it's slide-worthy or anything, but
enough where it gets a little precarious for those

00:51:06.422 --> 00:51:14.170
who don't have quite as much a grand hold on loose
earth. About five minutes of this, it evens out

00:51:14.170 --> 00:51:20.733
though, and as it does you come to a metallic
doorway.

00:51:20.733 --> 00:51:22.608
TRAVIS: Of course.

00:51:22.608 --> 00:51:24.245
LAURA: God damn doors.

00:51:24.245 --> 00:51:26.673
SAM: I got this.

00:51:26.673 --> 00:51:28.779
TRAVIS: Please just do it.

00:51:28.779 --> 00:51:30.511
LAURA: Inspect it for traps!

00:51:30.511 --> 00:51:31.744
TRAVIS: No, let him take it!

00:51:31.744 --> 00:51:36.166
LIAM: Why don't I look, and then Scanlan can
handle it? I'm just going to look, all right?

00:51:36.166 --> 00:51:39.271
Yeah, 23.

00:51:39.271 --> 00:51:44.683
MATT: Okay. The door does not appear to be
trapped, but it is locked.

00:51:44.683 --> 00:51:47.136
LIAM: Well.

00:51:47.136 --> 00:51:48.429
LAURA: Can you pick it?

00:51:48.429 --> 00:51:49.670
LIAM: Probably.

00:51:49.670 --> 00:51:51.036
TRAVIS: Metal door, right?

00:51:51.036 --> 00:51:52.046
MATT: Yeah.

00:51:52.046 --> 00:51:53.170
LIAM: Natural 20.

00:51:53.170 --> 00:52:00.468
MATT: All right. So, looking at the door, and the
closer you get as you bring some light source to

00:52:00.468 --> 00:52:09.985
it you can see the door itself is not an iron or a
slate metal, it's hammered bronze.

00:52:10.054 --> 00:52:14.988
The surface is semi-smooth but it does have
a bit of a warp to it from when the

00:52:15.061 --> 00:52:19.736
metal was originally plied and used to create this
doorway, so it has this hammered look across its

00:52:19.736 --> 00:52:26.254
entire surface, some small rivets in the side. You
do notice that there is no handle for it but on

00:52:26.254 --> 00:52:32.397
the other side of the door, there is something
that is latched over it, so using your dagger, you

00:52:32.397 --> 00:52:39.844
manage to lift it slightly and then shove forward
through the slight edge of the door frame to the

00:52:39.844 --> 00:52:44.999
door itself or means to force this off of its
latch and you hear the metallic arm bang against

00:52:44.999 --> 00:52:48.169
the other side of the door as it falls down, and
the door pushes open slightly.

00:52:48.169 --> 00:52:51.757
LIAM: I look back to the group and go, it won't
open, it won't--

00:52:51.757 --> 00:52:54.199
(laughter)

00:52:54.199 --> 00:53:00.374
LIAM: I don't push it that far, only like four or
five inches just to peer through.

00:53:00.374 --> 00:53:07.855
MATT: Okay. That same acrid smell that has
permeated into the hallway continues into this

00:53:07.855 --> 00:53:14.370
room, it's a little colder; the temperature in
this room is because, as you notice, looking in,

00:53:14.370 --> 00:53:20.800
what little bit of distance you can see in this
pitch black vicinity, the entire room is made of

00:53:20.800 --> 00:53:23.368
this type of hammered bronze.

00:53:23.368 --> 00:53:31.435
TRAVIS: Before we go in, are there any bits of
whitestone on the ground, like stuff in chunks or

00:53:31.435 --> 00:53:33.366
small pieces or is it pretty clean-ish?

00:53:33.366 --> 00:53:40.283
MATT: As you travel through here you see chunks
here and there, some of them appear to be, yeah,

00:53:40.283 --> 00:53:43.910
nothing bigger than what you can fit in your palm.
Any of the larger pieces seem to have made their

00:53:43.910 --> 00:53:50.400
way all the way back to the undercroft where you
guys had the ghost battle. At this point, you've

00:53:50.400 --> 00:53:53.509
just seen bits and pieces that may have fallen out
of whatever carts were brought through and you do

00:53:53.509 --> 00:53:56.541
see grooves in the ground where like large wheeled
carts were pushed back and forth up and down this

00:53:56.541 --> 00:53:59.658
tunnel to carry materials to and from.

00:53:59.658 --> 00:54:05.109
LIAM: I pull the door a little bit shut behind me
and turn to the group and say, this is a room

00:54:05.109 --> 00:54:12.538
made entirely of metal that presumably did not
exist five years ago. I think this is probably

00:54:12.538 --> 00:54:20.584
bad. Sister, dear, would you help me look? Just
from the door, please? Just look.

00:54:20.584 --> 00:54:22.671
TRAVIS: Scanlan, just shoot a lightning bolt in
there.

00:54:22.671 --> 00:54:27.017
LIAM: No, in a moment. Please. And perception
check the room from here.

00:54:27.017 --> 00:54:28.228
MATT: Go for it.

00:54:28.228 --> 00:54:32.124
LIAM: 29.

00:54:32.124 --> 00:54:42.495
LAURA: Oh, that's good, that's better than mine,
but not much. 23?

00:54:42.495 --> 00:54:43.904
TRAVIS: Question mark?

00:54:43.904 --> 00:54:49.511
MATT: Okay. Both glancing in what little bit of
space you have to poke through, you can see the

00:54:49.511 --> 00:55:00.288
room itself, it's about 80 feet across and about
50 feet wide. From the doorway, it's a slight ramp

00:55:00.288 --> 00:55:06.645
that leads down into an open floor area, also the
bronze metal, and then across the way another ramp

00:55:06.645 --> 00:55:13.519
that rises up to meet a small upper platform area.
and there appears to be a door

00:55:13.519 --> 00:55:14.771
on the opposite side.

00:55:14.771 --> 00:55:22.110
LAURA: Can I do an arcana check, or something, to
see if it's magic?

00:55:22.110 --> 00:55:27.912
MATT: If you'd like to. You'd probably have to get
a little closer into the room to check it out

00:55:27.912 --> 00:55:33.346
because you guys are at the outskirts of it.
You're just able to see a little bit of the edge

00:55:33.346 --> 00:55:34.787
of your visual distance.

00:55:34.787 --> 00:55:36.237
MARISHA: How big is the door?

00:55:36.237 --> 00:55:39.450
MATT: Looking at the door, if you open it up? It's
about two inches thick.

00:55:39.450 --> 00:55:49.965
LIAM: Pike, Keyleth, will you come up here? We're
a little out of our depths here. This seems suspect

00:55:50.020 --> 00:55:51.692
to me. I'd like you to both have a look.

00:55:51.692 --> 00:55:53.005
MARISHA: Yeah, something's going on here.

00:55:53.005 --> 00:55:54.496
ASHLEY: Yeah.

00:55:54.496 --> 00:55:58.528
MARISHA: So Pike and I are going up.

00:55:58.528 --> 00:55:59.815
ASHLEY: Yeah.

00:55:59.815 --> 00:56:02.524
LAURA: Go. Tell us what's up.

00:56:02.524 --> 00:56:09.126
MATT: Have you guys all moved up to the door, at
least? Or are you all still back in the corridor?

00:56:09.126 --> 00:56:10.843
SAM and TALIESIN: I'm moving up to the door.

00:56:10.843 --> 00:56:12.284
LAURA: I'm stepping a little back.

00:56:12.284 --> 00:56:16.734
MATT: Okay. Cassandra does say, "This is as far as
I've gone down here."

00:56:16.734 --> 00:56:19.223
LAURA: Do you know what's on the other side?

00:56:19.223 --> 00:56:25.317
MATT: "I assume the project. The last time I came
here, I was following the Briarwoods at a

00:56:25.370 --> 00:56:31.114
"distance. They went in there with a handful of
guards, and when I made it to this door, it was

00:56:31.114 --> 00:56:35.839
"empty on the inside. I assume they traveled
through that far door, but I have not actually

00:56:35.839 --> 00:56:39.932
"been here myself. It was at that point that I was
discovered and dragged back to the castle."

00:56:39.932 --> 00:56:41.930
TALIESIN: Did you make it to the acid pits?

00:56:41.930 --> 00:56:47.980
MATT: "Back that way? I saw them, from a distance.
I did not want to get too close. They're just

00:56:47.980 --> 00:56:59.311
"larger, stone troughs that these chemicals have
been refined in, and for whatever purpose they've

00:56:59.311 --> 00:57:05.338
"required them, have been kept there. Dr. Ripley,
actually, was in charge of a lot of that

00:57:05.338 --> 00:57:07.502
"development and creation."

00:57:07.502 --> 00:57:14.903
MARISHA: Percy and Cassandra, does this material
mean anything to you? The bronze? Does it keep any

00:57:14.903 --> 00:57:20.054
type of energy out? Why build a room out of
bronze?

00:57:20.054 --> 00:57:23.767
LIAM: That's a question for you, as well,
Percival.

00:57:23.767 --> 00:57:27.375
TALIESIN: I don't know. I would like to get a
better look. Are there markings on the walls? Is

00:57:27.375 --> 00:57:28.745
there any scripting?

00:57:28.745 --> 00:57:31.357
MATT: Make a perception check.

00:57:31.357 --> 00:57:38.484
TALIESIN: Get that out of the way. Nine?

00:57:38.484 --> 00:57:46.186
MATT: Okay. As you step into the room and look
along the walls at the top of the ramp that leads

00:57:46.186 --> 00:57:57.918
downward, there's no discerning features that you
can glance off visually across the walls. Hammered

00:57:57.918 --> 00:58:05.237
bronze with bronze bars across to keep all the
various plates that were put up together. It's not

00:58:05.326 --> 00:58:09.016
one solid piece, it's multiple sheets that were
all bolted and put together

00:58:09.080 --> 00:58:10.678
to create solid walls.

00:58:10.678 --> 00:58:12.130
MARISHA: And the floor is bronze?

00:58:12.130 --> 00:58:13.728
MATT: The floor is bronze, as well.

00:58:13.728 --> 00:58:14.675
TALIESIN: The roof?

00:58:14.675 --> 00:58:19.295
MATT: The roof is not bronze. The roof is what
looks like solid whitestone.

00:58:19.295 --> 00:58:21.907
SAM: That don't look good.

00:58:21.907 --> 00:58:26.475
LIAM: Pike, Keyleth, do you make anything of
this?

00:58:26.475 --> 00:58:31.023
TRAVIS: Anyone want to go touch a wall?

00:58:31.023 --> 00:58:32.717
MARISHA: I don't even know.

00:58:32.717 --> 00:58:34.387
LIAM: You have no knowledge of--

00:58:34.387 --> 00:58:42.107
MARISHA: I'm not great with magic. I'm great with
nature, and I'm not great with dungeoneering or

00:58:42.107 --> 00:58:48.781
anything like that, either. Can I do some sort of
nature check to see if this is a quarry that we

00:58:48.781 --> 00:58:50.384
just walked into?

00:58:50.384 --> 00:58:52.471
LAURA: A conductor?

00:58:52.471 --> 00:58:55.990
MARISHA: A conductor, yeah. It's not really a
nature thing, though.

00:58:55.990 --> 00:58:59.733
MATT: Make an intelligence check.

00:58:59.733 --> 00:59:03.623
MARISHA: Okay. Not my forte. Oh, natural 20!

00:59:03.623 --> 00:59:05.913
LAURA: That's a beautiful thing.

00:59:05.913 --> 00:59:10.218
MATT: Okay. This bronze-colored material, and
you're not too familiar with a lot of metals, but

00:59:10.218 --> 00:59:16.997
it appears to be an alloy of some kind. It would
probably be a good conductor of electricity, if

00:59:16.997 --> 00:59:24.245
utilized in a way, for whatever purpose you're
unable to ascertain, but this metal is not

00:59:24.245 --> 00:59:32.450
indigenous to this region, meaning the whole area
of Tal'Dorei. This metal is usually imported from

00:59:32.450 --> 00:59:39.306
distant lands. It is not found or created
naturally in this area, to your knowledge.

00:59:39.306 --> 00:59:45.559
MARISHA: And would I gather any information on the
purpose of this room and what it's used for?

00:59:45.559 --> 00:59:55.602
MATT: Not with your experience, no. Gathering
about, though, as you all gather in this area and

00:59:55.602 --> 01:00:02.951
are looking around, you notice that the stonework
on the ceiling has two discolorations. Across the

01:00:02.951 --> 01:00:08.908
top of the ramp above you, there is a one-inch
discoloration, almost like there's a drawn line

01:00:08.908 --> 01:00:18.764
across the stone. At that height and this lack of
light, can't tell if it's just a marking or an

01:00:18.764 --> 01:00:23.340
actual change in material, and there's one
on the other side of the room across the way at

01:00:23.401 --> 01:00:25.350
the top of the other ramp.

01:00:25.350 --> 01:00:27.191
LAURA: It's a conductor room.

01:00:27.191 --> 01:00:30.752
MARISHA: Oh, we're too far away to see what it's
made out of?

01:00:30.752 --> 01:00:34.008
MATT: At this distance and in this low light, it's
hard to tell. You can see that there's a

01:00:34.008 --> 01:00:37.254
discoloration or change, but it is a consistent
band across the top.

01:00:37.254 --> 01:00:38.630
SAM: Should we send some light up there?

01:00:38.630 --> 01:00:39.667
LAURA: How high are the ceilings?

01:00:39.667 --> 01:00:43.399
TRAVIS: I have darkvision at a range of 60 feet.
Can I see it?

01:00:43.504 --> 01:00:48.985
MATT: What darkvision is, it's very black and
white. You don't see a lot of color, and it's hard

01:00:48.985 --> 01:00:52.407
at this distance to make out anything. Without
feeling it or seeing it, it's hard to get

01:00:52.407 --> 01:00:53.425
details.

01:00:53.425 --> 01:00:56.089
LIAM: I checked the door, but I didn't check
anything else. Can I check the room for traps?

01:00:56.089 --> 01:00:57.242
MATT: Yeah, if you'd like to.

01:00:57.242 --> 01:01:01.063
LIAM: I would like to. Rolled a 23.

01:01:01.129 --> 01:01:08.458
MATT: Okay. As you descend the ramp, keeping a very
close eye on the ground around you, or are you

01:01:08.458 --> 01:01:10.210
just doing a visual scan?

01:01:10.210 --> 01:01:14.175
LIAM: I'll walk up within a foot of the first line
you referenced.

01:01:14.175 --> 01:01:22.423
MATT: On the ceiling? Okay. Glancing about, you
don't notice any traps. You do notice in the

01:01:22.423 --> 01:01:29.736
center of the room, the very center of the room on
the floor there is a small variation in the color.

01:01:29.736 --> 01:01:38.715
You see what looks like a small almost oval-type
smooth button. Or some sort of a strange object

01:01:38.715 --> 01:01:40.343
that is embedded in the floor.

01:01:40.343 --> 01:01:42.893
LAURA: Should I try to shoot it? When none of us
are in the room?

01:01:42.893 --> 01:01:47.692
SAM: I would just try to-- oh yeah. That's
interesting.

01:01:47.692 --> 01:01:49.436
(laughter)

01:01:49.436 --> 01:01:54.978
LIAM: That will probably tell us what this room is
about. I worry a little about alerting people on

01:01:54.978 --> 01:01:59.738
the other side of the room, but it feels dangerous
to go through here.

01:01:59.738 --> 01:02:03.651
TRAVIS: Oh man.

01:02:03.651 --> 01:02:05.133
LAURA: That's true.

01:02:05.133 --> 01:02:08.305
MARISHA: There's no vents? There's no ventilation
shaft, there's nothing?

01:02:08.305 --> 01:02:12.205
TRAVIS: The roof is flat, or is it coned?

01:02:12.205 --> 01:02:15.619
MATT: The roof is flat from what you can tell.
It's a giant box, it's just the walls

01:02:15.619 --> 01:02:16.705
and the floor.

01:02:16.705 --> 01:02:17.826
TRAVIS: Whitestone ceiling?

01:02:17.826 --> 01:02:21.462
MATT: The whitestone ceiling and the rest of it is
all this bronze material with a ramp that goes

01:02:21.462 --> 01:02:24.855
down towards the bottom and the ramp that goes on
the other end, with the two platforms, where you

01:02:24.855 --> 01:02:26.852
enter and where the other door across the way is.

01:02:26.852 --> 01:02:29.253
LAURA: So, can we clear out and I'll try to shoot
it?

01:02:29.253 --> 01:02:30.373
MARISHA: Sure.

01:02:30.373 --> 01:02:31.454
TALIESIN: See what happens.

01:02:31.518 --> 01:02:34.257
LAURA: Okay. I'll do that.

01:02:34.310 --> 01:02:39.252
MATT: So all of you step back out into the
hallway, your cluster of Percys and Cassandras.

01:02:39.252 --> 01:02:43.815
LIAM: I step one foot behind Cassandra Number
Two.

01:02:43.815 --> 01:02:50.046
MATT: All right. Go ahead and pull your arrow. You
aim carefully from just outside the doorway.

01:02:50.046 --> 01:02:53.289
MARISHA: You've got this.

01:02:53.289 --> 01:02:54.955
LAURA: Do I add my attack to it?

01:02:54.955 --> 01:02:56.649
MATT: Yes, you add your attack bonus.

01:02:56.649 --> 01:02:57.842
LAURA: 27.

01:02:57.842 --> 01:03:06.829
MATT: 27. So you release the arrow. Perfect hit.
On point. It strikes whatever this strange object

01:03:06.829 --> 01:03:11.746
is embedded in the floor. It hits and slightly
ricochets and splinters as an arrow would when it

01:03:11.746 --> 01:03:14.559
hits a hard surface. No seeming reaction.

01:03:14.559 --> 01:03:16.029
LAURA: It did nothing!

01:03:16.029 --> 01:03:22.209
TALIESIN: I'm going to try something. First of
all, does the construct of this at all remind me

01:03:22.209 --> 01:03:23.387
of anything?

01:03:23.387 --> 01:03:29.896
MATT: No, actually. Most of this tunnel structure
did not exist when you lived here. This has all

01:03:29.896 --> 01:03:36.454
been either re-discovered or created since you
left Whitestone.

01:03:36.454 --> 01:03:42.834
TALIESIN: I'm going to take my sword and I'm going
to go into the room and I'm going to lay my sword

01:03:42.834 --> 01:03:51.128
on the ground. Copper is a conductor. I'm having
that thought. I'm going to try and slide my sword

01:03:51.128 --> 01:03:56.918
towards the center of the room and see if I can
cause a short. With the piece of metal and get a

01:03:56.918 --> 01:04:00.821
positive and negative charge to hit and see if I
can get a reaction.

01:04:00.821 --> 01:04:08.626
MATT: All righty. As you step down to the bottom
of the slope as it meets the bottom, and there is

01:04:08.626 --> 01:04:14.983
an open area in the center of the floor now, about
a 20-foot area width between the two ramps. You're

01:04:14.983 --> 01:04:20.692
now at the bottom of the ramp. You take the sword
and you let it scatter across. And there are

01:04:20.692 --> 01:04:25.944
imperfections in the floor so it skips as it moves
and such and eventually slides to a stop. No

01:04:25.944 --> 01:04:31.431
effect. But you do get a better look at what this
thing is embedded in the floor. You not having

01:04:31.431 --> 01:04:34.058
darkvision, though, you would have to have a light
source for this.

01:04:34.058 --> 01:04:35.176
TALIESIN: I had a torch.

01:04:35.176 --> 01:04:39.934
MATT: Yeah. You bring your torch forward and you
look over. It looks like a smooth gem, like an

01:04:39.934 --> 01:04:46.080
opal or some sort of whitish opaque gem that is
embedded in the ground in the center.

01:04:46.080 --> 01:04:49.486
LAURA: The Arkenstone! Definitely.

01:04:49.486 --> 01:04:51.017
(laughter)

01:04:51.017 --> 01:04:55.513
TALIESIN: And it's not translucent? It's like an
opal-like stone?

01:04:55.513 --> 01:05:00.810
MATT: It's an opal-like stone, about that big that
is embedded in the bronze floor. There's actually

01:05:00.810 --> 01:05:07.138
a small, metal bronze band that encases it, wraps
around it that-- It wasn't just pressed into it; it

01:05:07.214 --> 01:05:09.496
was put there intentionally.

01:05:09.496 --> 01:05:11.120
TRAVIS: I say we smash it!

01:05:11.120 --> 01:05:13.511
TALIESIN: I say we remove it, at the very least.
See what happens.

01:05:13.511 --> 01:05:15.389
LAURA: Can you disarm it?

01:05:15.389 --> 01:05:17.196
MARISHA: All of those sound like bad ideas.

01:05:17.196 --> 01:05:18.261
SAM: Terrible.

01:05:18.261 --> 01:05:19.728
TALIESIN: Does anybody have a good idea?

01:05:19.728 --> 01:05:21.024
SAM: Why don't we just walk past it?

01:05:21.115 --> 01:05:22.947
MARISHA: I'm with Scanlan. I say we just go.

01:05:22.947 --> 01:05:28.071
TALIESIN: In the absence of good ideas, bad ideas,
I think, are always reasonable.

01:05:28.071 --> 01:05:31.602
MARISHA: But maybe mine and Scanlan's is a good
idea.

01:05:31.602 --> 01:05:34.928
LAURA: Maybe just try to get through the room.
Some of us stay on one side, some other people go

01:05:34.928 --> 01:05:36.921
through and see what happens to the first person.

01:05:36.921 --> 01:05:43.587
LIAM: So long as you all will pick me up off the
floor, I would like to skirt the entire side of

01:05:43.587 --> 01:05:44.425
the room.

01:05:44.425 --> 01:05:45.626
LAURA: And just go through the other door?

01:05:45.626 --> 01:05:47.038
LIAM: See if I can make it to the other door.

01:05:47.038 --> 01:05:47.943
MATT: All right.

01:05:47.943 --> 01:05:52.184
LIAM: Please help me if I fall down. And I start
along.

01:05:52.184 --> 01:05:53.433
TRAVIS: After a good giggle.

01:05:53.433 --> 01:05:59.458
MATT: As the floor ramps down towards the center,
you follow it along the wall. Making your way

01:05:59.458 --> 01:06:05.982
across, looking. You notice as you go across the
wall, there are three more of these same opal

01:06:05.982 --> 01:06:08.058
stones embedded in the wall about shoulder
height.

01:06:08.058 --> 01:06:09.036
LIAM: In the wall?

01:06:09.036 --> 01:06:10.412
MATT: In the wall as you go across.

01:06:10.412 --> 01:06:12.740
LIAM: Is it one in the middle and then one in the
center of each wall?

01:06:12.740 --> 01:06:14.484
MATT: On just on your wall--

01:06:14.484 --> 01:06:15.664
LIAM: Just on my wall?

01:06:15.664 --> 01:06:19.081
MATT: Just on your wall, there's three along the
way. There's one in the center of the room in line

01:06:19.081 --> 01:06:23.612
with the central opal, and there's two to the
sides of it about four feet from each other.

01:06:23.612 --> 01:06:27.798
LIAM: I've gone into a crouch, so I'm very low,
butt dragging along the floor and just sort of--

01:06:27.798 --> 01:06:30.561
MATT: So you notice that. You skirt underneath.

01:06:30.561 --> 01:06:32.474
LIAM: Leaning my back against the wall.

01:06:32.474 --> 01:06:37.546
MATT: Okay. They pass overhead. As you make your
way underneath the three opals in this part of the

01:06:37.546 --> 01:06:41.090
wall. Making your way up the other ramp to the
other side.

01:06:41.090 --> 01:06:42.360
LIAM: Continued perception check?

01:06:42.360 --> 01:06:43.866
MATT: Make a perception check.

01:06:43.866 --> 01:06:47.390
LIAM: Yeah. 23.

01:06:47.390 --> 01:06:55.665
MATT: Okay. You make your way up this side looking
about on the floor. Nothing seems to happen,

01:06:55.665 --> 01:07:02.059
nothing catches your eye. You get onto this upper
platform, and there is the door there

01:07:02.059 --> 01:07:03.554
in front of you.

01:07:03.554 --> 01:07:08.769
LIAM: I check for traps on the door. That is a
24.

01:07:08.769 --> 01:07:12.916
MATT: The door does not appear to be trapped.

01:07:12.916 --> 01:07:14.008
LIAM: Or locked?

01:07:14.008 --> 01:07:18.965
MATT: Does not appear to be locked. It does not
seem to have a mechanism for opening other than if

01:07:18.965 --> 01:07:20.466
you wanted to try and push.

01:07:20.466 --> 01:07:21.647
TRAVIS: Go through it!

01:07:21.647 --> 01:07:29.850
SAM: No, let's get out of here. They wouldn't
build a huge bronze trap room within their castle.

01:07:29.850 --> 01:07:36.112
No, they've lived here in peace for five years.
What would they need this for? This has some sort

01:07:36.112 --> 01:07:38.633
of use for their magic. This is not a trap room.

01:07:38.633 --> 01:07:42.669
TRAVIS: We should try to remove one of the
stones.

01:07:42.669 --> 01:07:48.685
MARISHA: Question. Are the stones mathematically
adjacent to each other?

01:07:48.685 --> 01:07:51.270
Do they appear to be lined up?

01:07:51.270 --> 01:07:55.548
MATT: Well as you can tell, there's the one in the
center of the middle of the floor. Then there's

01:07:55.548 --> 01:08:03.430
one on the wall that he walked across, and as you
to the other wall, there are another

01:08:03.497 --> 01:08:05.420
matching set of three on both walls.

01:08:05.420 --> 01:08:06.546
MARISHA: And they're all lined up.

01:08:06.546 --> 01:08:08.967
MATT: And they're all lined up. There's the two in
the center of the room that match the one in the

01:08:08.967 --> 01:08:11.829
floor and then there's one to each side of that
about four feet apart.

01:08:11.829 --> 01:08:14.178
MARISHA: Okay. I'm going to walk in a little bit.
Are there any on the ceiling?

01:08:14.178 --> 01:08:19.425
MATT: Looking up. Make a perception check.

01:08:19.641 --> 01:08:21.043
MARISHA: Natural one.

01:08:21.043 --> 01:08:23.928
MATT: You get lost in the beauty of the
structure.

01:08:23.928 --> 01:08:25.361
(laughter)

01:08:25.361 --> 01:08:27.329
TALIESIN: I was going to look to see if there was
one matching the one on the floor.

01:08:27.329 --> 01:08:28.346
MATT: Okay.

01:08:28.346 --> 01:08:30.324
MARISHA: That's good metal! Good craftsmanship,
damn.

01:08:30.324 --> 01:08:33.872
TALIESIN: Yeah, that's good, that's a 27.

01:08:33.961 --> 01:08:43.348
MATT: Looking up, no. The ceiling is just smooth
whitestone. You, pushing the door-- it doesn't

01:08:43.437 --> 01:08:52.617
open. It is solid stone, and as you push and look,
you can see there's no hinges. Looking at where it

01:08:52.617 --> 01:08:58.859
meets the wall, it looks like it slid down into a
groove. It's actually a door that would lift or

01:08:58.859 --> 01:09:03.574
sink. It slides. Some way, shape, or form, it
slides into place.

01:09:03.574 --> 01:09:07.743
LIAM: Grog doesn't have an earring, does he?

01:09:07.743 --> 01:09:08.873
TRAVIS: Yeah, I do.

01:09:08.873 --> 01:09:12.284
MARISHA: I think we all have earrings right now.

01:09:12.284 --> 01:09:13.415
LIAM: Grog?

01:09:13.415 --> 01:09:15.988
LAURA: He's right there! Just fucking talk to
him.

01:09:15.988 --> 01:09:21.948
LIAM: He's across an 80-foot room! I'm not going
to shout down here. There's a big heavy thing.

01:09:21.948 --> 01:09:23.137
TRAVIS: Yeah?

01:09:23.137 --> 01:09:26.422
LIAM: And you're the best you are at what you do.
Do you think you could shimmy along on your tummy,

01:09:26.422 --> 01:09:32.300
along a side wall? Don't stand up because there's
gems in the walls along the way and I don't know

01:09:32.300 --> 01:09:37.287
what they do, so stay low, please? And come meet
me up here.

01:09:37.287 --> 01:09:43.328
TRAVIS: I just kinda want to walk across the room.

01:09:43.392 --> 01:09:44.568
LAURA: Do it.

01:09:44.568 --> 01:09:45.617
TRAVIS: I walk across the room.

01:09:45.617 --> 01:09:52.208
MATT: Okay. So you watch in horror as Grog just
strolls full, upright back, hammer in his arm with

01:09:52.208 --> 01:09:58.475
a big grin on his face. Looking like a really
burly Percy. I have to keep reminding myself. It's

01:09:58.475 --> 01:10:00.574
a very curious visual every time.

01:10:00.574 --> 01:10:02.276
TRAVIS: I adjust my amazing spectacles.

01:10:02.276 --> 01:10:06.102
MATT: Passes right through the center of where
these opals are aligned across from each other.

01:10:06.102 --> 01:10:11.903
Seeming no effect. Makes his way up the ramp to
where you are on the opposite side of the room.

01:10:11.903 --> 01:10:13.727
TALIESIN: I'm going to go get my sword.

01:10:13.727 --> 01:10:22.049
MARISHA: Well, hang on, while Grog goes and lifts
the thing. While Grog does that, do I have any

01:10:22.049 --> 01:10:26.676
idea where we are geographically in the city,
underground?

01:10:26.676 --> 01:10:34.387
MATT: Keeping track best you can, you gather
you're about a quarter-mile from the center of the

01:10:34.387 --> 01:10:39.546
city, from the square where the Sun Tree is. It's
a quarter-mile south of you.

01:10:39.546 --> 01:10:41.311
MARISHA: So probably not under the Sun Tree.

01:10:41.311 --> 01:10:42.399
MATT: Currently, no.

01:10:42.399 --> 01:10:43.348
MARISHA: Okay.

01:10:43.348 --> 01:10:47.455
TRAVIS: Walking up to the door, does it look like
I can get any purchase with my little

01:10:47.455 --> 01:10:48.485
finger-bits?

01:10:48.485 --> 01:10:50.056
MATT: Nope. It is flush with the ground.

01:10:50.056 --> 01:10:52.996
TRAVIS: I have a pickaxe that I picked up before
we left.

01:10:52.996 --> 01:10:54.011
MATT: Okay.

01:10:54.011 --> 01:10:57.844
TRAVIS: Can I swing it at the bottom and try and
find some purchase under the door?

01:10:57.844 --> 01:11:07.406
MATT: You could try. Yeah, go ahead. Go ahead and
roll an athletics check to see if you can manage

01:11:07.406 --> 01:11:09.255
to get anything in there.

01:11:09.255 --> 01:11:12.384
TRAVIS: Okay. 16?

01:11:12.384 --> 01:11:17.752
MATT: 16? Okay, so you take it and you try to get
a few whacks in, it's not really getting in there.

01:11:17.752 --> 01:11:19.425
Make a strength check.

01:11:19.425 --> 01:11:25.573
TRAVIS: Shit. Fuck. Nine?

01:11:25.573 --> 01:11:33.717
MATT: Nine? You swing with the pickaxe downward
for a full angry Grog-swing, and as you hit, you

01:11:33.717 --> 01:11:39.196
feel the pickaxe move further than it did before,
and for a split-second your brain's like, great!

01:11:39.196 --> 01:11:42.462
And then you look down and notice that the actual
handle of the pickaxe has shattered from the

01:11:42.462 --> 01:11:44.372
impact, broken in two.

01:11:44.372 --> 01:11:46.685
TALIESIN: We're not thinking about this clearly.

01:11:46.685 --> 01:11:48.450
TRAVIS: Thinking?

01:11:48.450 --> 01:11:53.604
SAM: We've been beaten by doors before, but
goddamn it, we're not going to be beaten today. I

01:11:53.604 --> 01:11:59.581
go to the center of the room and I find that
little button thing and I'm going to press it.

01:11:59.581 --> 01:12:00.674
TALIESIN: Good.

01:12:00.674 --> 01:12:05.947
MATT: Okay. You go and press your thumb down on
it. It doesn't move, it doesn't shift. It doesn't

01:12:05.947 --> 01:12:11.518
give way at all, it just stays in place. As you
pull your thumb away, though, you notice that the

01:12:11.518 --> 01:12:16.314
gem has a very soft, faint white glow to it, and a
second after you pull your thumb

01:12:16.314 --> 01:12:17.575
away it fades back.

01:12:17.575 --> 01:12:19.870
TALIESIN: I walk over to the wall and touch one of
the other gems.

01:12:19.870 --> 01:12:20.919
LAURA: I touch another one.

01:12:20.919 --> 01:12:22.346
MARISHA: I touch another one!

01:12:22.346 --> 01:12:26.492
MATT: You guys all place your hands against the
opals on the sides, and checking as you pull your

01:12:26.492 --> 01:12:30.240
hand away, the opals glow brightly white again,
and then fade.

01:12:30.240 --> 01:12:31.448
MARISHA: Pike.

01:12:31.448 --> 01:12:33.727
TRAVIS: I am Captain Planet. No.

01:12:33.727 --> 01:12:35.546
LAURA: Touch one of the stones, Grog.

01:12:35.546 --> 01:12:37.028
TRAVIS: I run over and touch a stone.

01:12:37.028 --> 01:12:38.265
LIAM: I touch one, too.

01:12:38.265 --> 01:12:43.883
MATT: (laughs) All right, so that's three on one
side, three on the other, who's got the middle

01:12:43.883 --> 01:12:45.516
one? You got the middle one?

01:12:45.516 --> 01:12:46.666
SAM: I'm in the middle.

01:12:46.666 --> 01:12:47.495
ASHLEY: I got one.

01:12:47.495 --> 01:12:48.525
LAURA: Trinket.

01:12:48.525 --> 01:12:51.978
SAM: Yeah, can Trinket touch a stone? Or
Cassandra. Cassandra, make yourself useful for

01:12:51.978 --> 01:12:53.133
Christ's sake.

01:12:53.133 --> 01:12:54.808
LIAM: Who's Christ?

01:12:54.978 --> 01:12:59.343
SAM: My friend back in Gnomolia, where I'm from.

01:12:59.409 --> 01:13:01.420
MATT: Pike, are you grabbing a stone or not?

01:13:01.574 --> 01:13:02.663
ASHLEY: What was that?

01:13:02.663 --> 01:13:04.074
MATT: Are you touching a stone or not?

01:13:04.074 --> 01:13:05.115
ASHLEY: Yes, I am.

01:13:05.115 --> 01:13:12.409
MATT: Okay. That's seven. So three on one side,
three on the other, Trinket keeping there with

01:13:12.409 --> 01:13:20.046
anticipation up next to you. Pike, you put your
hand on the final stone. A moment passes.

01:13:20.046 --> 01:13:22.929
LAURA: This is totally going to work.

01:13:22.929 --> 01:13:24.214
MARISHA: Come on, guys.

01:13:24.214 --> 01:13:26.151
MATT: Doesn't seem to have an immediate effect.

01:13:26.151 --> 01:13:27.203
SAM: Wait.

01:13:27.203 --> 01:13:31.668
MARISHA: No, maybe if we all think about the
strength of our friendship and bond together.

01:13:31.668 --> 01:13:34.513
LIAM: This is our time now!

01:13:34.513 --> 01:13:39.948
SAM: Hold on, as much as I love Pike, you aren't a
real person right now.

01:13:39.948 --> 01:13:42.308
Maybe we should swap out Pike.

01:13:42.308 --> 01:13:46.685
MATT: Yeah, Pike, as you pull your hand away, the
stone is glowing. And it fades momentarily after

01:13:46.685 --> 01:13:47.634
you put your hand there.

01:13:47.634 --> 01:13:49.410
SAM: Oh, it does work. Never mind, Pike. I love
you.

01:13:49.410 --> 01:13:50.549
ASHLEY: But are there any on the ceiling?

01:13:50.549 --> 01:13:52.012
MATT: Nothing on the ceiling.

01:13:52.012 --> 01:13:53.466
LAURA: Do we see any missing ones?

01:13:53.466 --> 01:13:56.099
MATT: Roll a perception check.

01:13:56.099 --> 01:14:02.621
LAURA: 21.

01:14:02.621 --> 01:14:10.278
MATT: 21. Okay. Looking about, Cassandra actually,
who's up towards the far ramp, seems to notice

01:14:10.278 --> 01:14:14.410
something and walks up to where the door is,
looking at the foot of the door. She moves her

01:14:14.410 --> 01:14:18.608
hand out of the way and presses her hand down on a
hidden eighth opal.

01:14:18.608 --> 01:14:19.952
LAURA: Nice!

01:14:19.952 --> 01:14:25.738
MATT: At which point there's a shift, a sound of
stone shifting loudly, and those bars across the

01:14:25.738 --> 01:14:37.558
ceiling, the green bars? Let loose a bit of dust,
and two large walls of green glass (impact noise)

01:14:37.558 --> 01:14:43.348
slam downward to the front and back of you,
locking all seven of you into the center of this

01:14:43.415 --> 01:14:44.803
bronze room.

01:14:44.803 --> 01:14:46.172
LIAM: Where's Cassandra?

01:14:46.172 --> 01:14:51.071
MATT: Cassandra's on the other side of the green
wall on the far end of the room.

01:14:51.071 --> 01:14:54.838
MARISHA: Can we hear each other through the
glass?

01:14:54.838 --> 01:15:00.273
MATT: Cassandra runs up to the glass and puts her
hands to it, and you can hear her voice saying,

01:15:00.273 --> 01:15:02.483
"Is everyone all right?"

01:15:02.483 --> 01:15:03.957
LAURA: Is she on the other side of it?

01:15:03.957 --> 01:15:09.519
MATT: She went up to the far platform. Which, by
the way, you notice immediately, this glass, this

01:15:09.519 --> 01:15:15.503
weird, warped glass that forms these walls is the
same material as the shards of green glass

01:15:15.534 --> 01:15:18.485
that you found broken on parts of the ground in
the Undercroft.

01:15:18.485 --> 01:15:20.765
SAM: Grog, can you hit it?

01:15:20.765 --> 01:15:23.759
TRAVIS: Yeah. Anybody have any objections?

01:15:23.759 --> 01:15:24.809
ALL: No.

01:15:24.809 --> 01:15:26.222
TRAVIS: I swing away.

01:15:26.222 --> 01:15:32.724
MATT: Okay. Cassandra takes a step back, go ahead
and roll for an attack.

01:15:32.724 --> 01:15:34.595
LAURA: Is the door opening behind her?

01:15:34.595 --> 01:15:36.877
MATT: The door is opening, actually, behind her.

01:15:36.877 --> 01:15:38.368
TRAVIS: 19.

01:15:38.368 --> 01:15:42.701
MATT: 19? You go ahead and you strike forward. Go
ahead and roll damage.

01:15:42.701 --> 01:15:50.685
TRAVIS: 16.

01:15:50.685 --> 01:15:56.723
MATT: 16. Okay. You strike with all your might
across the front of the glass, Cassandra steps

01:15:56.723 --> 01:16:02.778
back as the might of it hits. A streak of green
sparks fly off the edge of the blade as it careens

01:16:02.778 --> 01:16:11.645
across the front and goes (metal noises) leaving
bare but a scratch across the stone. At this

01:16:11.645 --> 01:16:15.645
point, you guys see the door opening behind
Cassandra, and two figures step in behind her.

01:16:15.645 --> 01:16:16.900
LAURA: Goddamn it.

01:16:16.900 --> 01:16:20.217
MARISHA: I'm going to go ahead and cast
Thunderwave. Maybe this shit can only be taken

01:16:20.217 --> 01:16:21.223
down with magic.

01:16:21.223 --> 01:16:22.852
SAM: Wait, but are you going to hurt us?

01:16:22.852 --> 01:16:26.189
LAURA: I dip my arrows in holy oil. Three of
them.

01:16:26.189 --> 01:16:31.510
MARISHA: No, it's just a push spell, but it's
radiant damage thing. But you guys

01:16:31.510 --> 01:16:32.747
are behind the glass.

01:16:32.747 --> 01:16:33.927
TRAVIS: We're all in the glass.

01:16:33.927 --> 01:16:35.015
LAURA: We're all in the glass.

01:16:35.015 --> 01:16:36.238
TRAVIS: No, we're in a closed space.

01:16:36.238 --> 01:16:38.116
SAM: We're all going to get hit by what you're
doing.

01:16:38.116 --> 01:16:42.024
MARISHA: Well, if it breaks the glass, we won't be
separated by glass.

01:16:42.024 --> 01:16:43.809
TRAVIS: Might as well die one way or another.

01:16:43.809 --> 01:16:46.327
MARISHA: You wanted me to try and get us--

01:16:46.327 --> 01:16:47.501
LAURA: Just do it.

01:16:47.501 --> 01:16:55.214
LIAM: While all this is happening, I pull the vial
of poison that I traded from that hag and start to

01:16:55.214 --> 01:16:58.710
drip it down onto my blade of life-stealing behind
the group.

01:16:58.710 --> 01:17:03.003
MATT: Okay. As you guys all gather back and up at
this point, Grog, I don't know if you're still

01:17:03.003 --> 01:17:03.993
swinging?

01:17:03.993 --> 01:17:05.448
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, I'm just (angry noises).

01:17:05.448 --> 01:17:11.223
MATT: As this is happening, are you preparing
Thunderwave? You said you wanted to try?

01:17:11.223 --> 01:17:13.847
LAURA: Do it. You said you wanted to do it, just
do it.

01:17:13.847 --> 01:17:18.001
MARISHA: All right. I take my staff, crack it
down, cast Thunderwave.

01:17:18.001 --> 01:17:19.649
See if I can shatter this glass.

01:17:19.649 --> 01:17:25.457
MATT: With a loud sound-blast echoing through the
room, you can hear the reverberation of the actual

01:17:25.457 --> 01:17:31.617
bronze material sending back the vibrations of
this spell. All of you who weren't covering your

01:17:31.617 --> 01:17:36.250
ears very heartily, it still creeps through and
rings your head a little bit. As the blast hits

01:17:36.250 --> 01:17:42.563
the glass, it seems to have no effect. The actual
essence of the spell itself is scattered across

01:17:42.563 --> 01:17:50.577
its surface. This residuum-sealed green glass. The
two figures step into what little bit of light is

01:17:50.577 --> 01:17:58.356
now visible from Percy's torch that is twisted
through the warped surface of this glass wall, and

01:17:58.356 --> 01:18:03.825
you see before you Lord and Lady Briarwood
stepping up to the wall, looking through, their

01:18:03.825 --> 01:18:08.272
warped visage through the glass looking down into
the chamber that you're all currently locked in.

01:18:08.272 --> 01:18:14.672
LAURA: Oh, is this your room? I didn't even
realize we were in your house right now. How good

01:18:14.672 --> 01:18:16.664
to see you again, darling.

01:18:16.664 --> 01:18:23.586
MATT: Sylas leans forward and puts his hand to the
glass and says, "And hello to you, too. And

01:18:23.586 --> 01:18:28.591
"welcome to all of you. Well, my dear."

01:18:28.591 --> 01:18:35.394
At which point Delilah steps forward and goes, "I
was hoping for a more formal reunion, but you

01:18:35.394 --> 01:18:40.217
"insisted on riling up the populace and tying up
the bulk of our forces.

01:18:40.217 --> 01:18:42.824
"Rather unfortunate, really."

01:18:42.824 --> 01:18:52.665
LIAM: Now, the door's open behind them, right? If
I use perception, do I see anything behind them,

01:18:52.665 --> 01:18:56.465
any switch or lever or anything?

01:18:56.465 --> 01:18:59.036
MATT: Go ahead and make a perception check.

01:18:59.036 --> 01:19:00.310
LIAM: 20.

01:19:00.310 --> 01:19:06.812
MATT: 20. Looking across the way, but barely able
to peer past them with very little light in the

01:19:06.812 --> 01:19:18.923
distortion of the glass, you can see what seems to
be some sort of a smooth stone placard that's

01:19:18.923 --> 01:19:21.746
embedded in the wall just on the other side of the
door.

01:19:21.746 --> 01:19:23.544
LIAM: Just outside the door.

01:19:23.544 --> 01:19:24.678
MATT: Yeah.

01:19:24.678 --> 01:19:33.498
LIAM: Then I pull the cape around me and I
Dimension Door.

01:19:33.498 --> 01:19:35.286
SAM: What!

01:19:35.286 --> 01:19:41.386
LIAM: Outside that door, right by the placard, and
jam my hand on that.

01:19:41.386 --> 01:19:43.033
MATT: Okay.

01:19:43.033 --> 01:19:44.678
SAM: You can do that?

01:19:44.678 --> 01:19:53.286
MATT: You, all of a sudden, vanish from that room,
and you press your hand into that placard. You can

01:19:53.286 --> 01:20:00.493
notice, Sylas looks over his shoulder with a
slight look of unexpected surprise. The smile's

01:20:00.493 --> 01:20:02.156
still across his face.

01:20:02.156 --> 01:20:04.209
MARISHA: Can I go ahead and start conjuring
Sunbeam?

01:20:04.209 --> 01:20:09.908
MATT: That's if you want to. It's a spell that you
do as you do it.

01:20:09.908 --> 01:20:11.650
You can't really hold it in place.

01:20:11.650 --> 01:20:12.568
MARISHA: Okay.

01:20:12.568 --> 01:20:13.804
MATT: You pressed the platform in--

01:20:13.804 --> 01:20:15.040
(Skype noise)

01:20:15.040 --> 01:20:16.599
MARISHA: No!

01:20:16.599 --> 01:20:18.149
TRAVIS: Keep going.

01:20:18.149 --> 01:20:30.325
MATT: As you push in, there's a sound of grinding
stone again. However, the walls stay in place. Two

01:20:30.325 --> 01:20:38.120
of the highest bronze plates that are pressed
against the wall shift inside and move out of the

01:20:38.120 --> 01:20:46.680
way. And two big tubes push outward. Sylas looks
over his shoulder and says, "Well, I was not

01:20:46.680 --> 01:20:52.533
"expecting you to want to see your friends
dissolved quite so quickly, but certainly."

01:20:52.533 --> 01:20:55.498
LAURA: Oh my god, we're going to die.

01:20:55.498 --> 01:21:01.112
MATT: As you guys look up, this green viscous
liquid begins to pour--

01:21:01.112 --> 01:21:05.986
TALIESIN: I stop, I pull out the gun, and the
second those hit-- I've seen this coming, because

01:21:05.986 --> 01:21:14.266
fucking copper room, fucking acid. Ice shot to the
one tube, do my best to reload as quickly as I can

01:21:14.266 --> 01:21:17.501
and ice shot to the other. I'm going to try and
clog them with ice, at least temporarily.

01:21:17.501 --> 01:21:21.052
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and make your first shot.

01:21:21.052 --> 01:21:29.444
TALIESIN: That's 15. 27.

01:21:29.444 --> 01:21:31.533
MATT: 27. Okay.

01:21:31.533 --> 01:21:44.359
TALIESIN: To hit. And that's ten plus three points
of ice damage.

01:21:44.359 --> 01:21:53.418
MATT: Okay. The bullet slams into the bottom of
this tube, and the tube itself is not made of any

01:21:53.418 --> 01:21:58.588
real thick material; it's a similar material to
the bronze the rest of this room is constructed

01:21:58.588 --> 01:22:03.867
in, and it seems like it's brought in by some sort
of mechanism that locks into place. As the bullet

01:22:03.867 --> 01:22:08.106
strikes the bottom of it, it bends upward, closing
off part of its passageway, and locking off the

01:22:08.106 --> 01:22:16.592
other half with ice, seemingly holding it for the
time being. While you're reloading, I need you to

01:22:16.592 --> 01:22:19.006
go ahead and make a wisdom saving throw.

01:22:19.006 --> 01:22:20.052
LIAM: I have advantage.

01:22:20.052 --> 01:22:21.389
MATT: You do.

01:22:21.389 --> 01:22:25.083
TRAVIS: What about these jewels?

01:22:25.083 --> 01:22:26.719
MATT: The Feast gives you advantage.

01:22:26.719 --> 01:22:32.000
LIAM: The Feast gives me advantage, well, but it
doesn't stack, right? I rolled a 16.

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:36.102
MATT: You rolled a 16? All right.

01:22:36.102 --> 01:22:38.287
TALIESIN: It was a good thought.

01:22:38.287 --> 01:22:44.835
MATT: As you pull your hand out of the switch,
Sylas's gaze pierces into your eyes, and your

01:22:44.835 --> 01:22:52.501
blades, before you have a moment to notice, have
already sheathed themselves, and you step into the

01:22:52.501 --> 01:22:54.741
room alongside the two of them.

01:22:54.741 --> 01:22:59.763
TRAVIS: The jewels! It was what lowered the glass.
Break the jewels!

01:22:59.763 --> 01:23:05.325
MATT: Sylas comes and pats you on the shoulder and
goes, "However, it doesn't hurt to have friends.

01:23:05.325 --> 01:23:12.627
"Thankfully, we were ahead of our residuum
production schedule, and, well, a few minor

01:23:12.627 --> 01:23:16.602
"modifications to our distillery room made an
excellent trap for you."

01:23:16.602 --> 01:23:23.341
Delilah turns to him and says, "Bit
unceremonious, but I'm not in the mood to break a

01:23:23.406 --> 01:23:31.599
"sweat today. We're still weeks off from being
ready, and I have much work to do." At which

01:23:31.599 --> 01:23:34.251
point, they both look over and put their hands on
Cassandra. Cassandra's still standing there

01:23:34.251 --> 01:23:44.218
staring at the room with a look of coldness mixed
with this brimming sense of desperation and worry.

01:23:44.218 --> 01:23:49.724
There's this crux moment in her where there's this
inner conflict within her right now.

01:23:49.724 --> 01:23:55.152
TRAVIS: Can I take a swing at the jewel that I was
holding my hand over?

01:23:55.152 --> 01:23:56.477
TALIESIN: I want to get my second.

01:23:56.477 --> 01:23:58.459
MATT: Quickly, he's going to get his next shot
here.

01:23:58.459 --> 01:24:03.749
TALIESIN: Reload, second shot. 15?

01:24:03.826 --> 01:24:11.505
MATT: 15. As you fire the second, it ricochets off
the bronze nearby. The liquid begins to pour in

01:24:11.590 --> 01:24:18.293
now. One side is currently held, but the other
half spills and begins cascading into the room.

01:24:18.293 --> 01:24:21.436
LAURA: I drink my Potion of Flying that I took
from Ripley.

01:24:21.436 --> 01:24:26.345
MATT: Okay, you chug a Potion of Flying, and you
begin lifting off the ground. The rest of you, you

01:24:26.345 --> 01:24:34.997
do have these two ramps that push up at least five
feet towards where these glass walls are, but the

01:24:34.997 --> 01:24:38.035
bottom of this entire room is beginning to fill
with this liquid.

01:24:38.035 --> 01:24:46.065
MARISHA: Can I go ahead and on my-- I'm assuming I
have spigots in my room? We're each in individual

01:24:46.065 --> 01:24:47.517
rooms with our own spigots?

01:24:47.517 --> 01:24:50.150
MATT: No, you're all in the same room, sealed
by two walls.

01:24:50.150 --> 01:24:53.814
LAURA: That's why the Thunderwave hit us all,
because we're all in one giant room together.

01:24:53.880 --> 01:24:54.891
MARISHA: Okay.

01:24:54.891 --> 01:24:57.114
TALIESIN: And all the gems are in our room,
correct?

01:24:57.114 --> 01:24:59.846
MATT: Correct, yes. All the gems except for the
one that Cassandra touched.

01:24:59.846 --> 01:25:00.850
TALIESIN: Yeah.

01:25:00.850 --> 01:25:02.112
TRAVIS: Can I hit the fucking jewel?

01:25:02.112 --> 01:25:02.938
LAURA: Do it!

01:25:02.938 --> 01:25:03.860
SAM: Yeah, do it.

01:25:03.860 --> 01:25:04.644
TRAVIS: Can I try?

01:25:04.644 --> 01:25:05.846
MATT: Yep.

01:25:05.846 --> 01:25:06.964
TRAVIS: 18.

01:25:06.964 --> 01:25:11.566
MATT: Okay. You reach down and strike the gem. Go
ahead and roll damage.

01:25:11.566 --> 01:25:18.247
TRAVIS: No fire damage, so 15.

01:25:18.247 --> 01:25:23.635
MATT: 15, okay. You strike the gem as hard as you
can, you can see it crack a little bit from the

01:25:23.635 --> 01:25:31.097
impact. The actual gem itself has a small crack
run through its center. Are you guys all currently

01:25:31.097 --> 01:25:34.660
at the top of the ramps?

01:25:34.660 --> 01:25:37.257
LAURA: We're backing up to where we're not in the
middle of the acid.

01:25:37.257 --> 01:25:42.003
MATT: Is what I'm asking, yeah. Trinket's backed
up awkwardly against the back, looking really

01:25:42.003 --> 01:25:48.180
uncomfortable. Cassandra puts her hand up to the
wall, and looks at the group of you and says,

01:25:48.180 --> 01:25:50.219
"Which one is my Percy?"

01:25:50.219 --> 01:26:03.224
TALIESIN: I walk up, I look at her, and I smile.
It's all right. See you soon. And going to go

01:26:03.224 --> 01:26:08.223
right into pulling out the gun and preparing.

01:26:08.223 --> 01:26:10.077
LAURA: Preparing what?

01:26:10.077 --> 01:26:12.165
TALIESIN: We're going to take out these gems.

01:26:12.165 --> 01:26:13.271
LAURA: Okay.

01:26:13.271 --> 01:26:15.031
TALIESIN: We're going to be fine, but we have to
do it now.

01:26:15.031 --> 01:26:18.930
MARISHA: While they take out the gems, these
earrings work telepathically, right?

01:26:18.930 --> 01:26:21.577
MATT: No, you actually talk into them and it
happens.

01:26:21.577 --> 01:26:27.507
MARISHA: Okay, I'm going to back into the corridor
while you guys handle the gems and start talking

01:26:27.507 --> 01:26:28.447
to Vax.

01:26:28.447 --> 01:26:29.841
MATT: There's no corridor. You're inside.

01:26:29.841 --> 01:26:31.322
MARISHA: Or the ramp, whatever.

01:26:31.322 --> 01:26:36.219
MATT: Okay, you're backing up on the ramp. As
you're doing that.

01:26:36.219 --> 01:26:38.470
TALIESIN: I'm going to be fine. Go.

01:26:38.470 --> 01:26:42.262
MATT: She leans forward with her hand on the wall
and looks at you in the eyes. You can see there's

01:26:42.262 --> 01:26:50.615
tears running down her face and she says, "Your
sister left us the day those arrows found my

01:26:50.615 --> 01:27:02.790
"chest. I did not die from those wounds but to
watch you leave me there in the snow. I have a new

01:27:02.790 --> 01:27:16.370
"family. I am a Briarwood. And I have a destiny
with the Whispered One." She steps back as the two

01:27:16.434 --> 01:27:22.031
Briarwoods put their arms around your sister, and
even still there's a shake to her voice, and you

01:27:22.095 --> 01:27:31.899
can see in her eyes there's a quake. She speaks
words of conviction, but you know deep inside,

01:27:31.911 --> 01:27:33.995
even there's conflict.

01:27:33.995 --> 01:27:41.405
At which point Delilah kisses her on the head and
says, "Don't worry, my dear. It'll be over soon."

01:27:41.405 --> 01:27:45.780
And they turn around and step into the hallway
they entered from.

01:27:45.780 --> 01:27:55.393
LIAM: One question, and I'm assuming I'm gone, but
in combat, I would be able to roll a wisdom save

01:27:55.393 --> 01:27:57.438
every six seconds, right?

01:27:57.438 --> 01:28:02.116
MATT: No. For this, you are technically charmed
for 24 hours.

01:28:02.116 --> 01:28:03.777
LIAM: 24 hours.

01:28:03.777 --> 01:28:06.134
MARISHA: Can I start talking to Vax over the
comms?

01:28:06.134 --> 01:28:07.508
TRAVIS: Can I hit the gem, please?

01:28:07.508 --> 01:28:09.346
MATT: All right.

01:28:09.346 --> 01:28:13.784
LAURA: Can I Hunter's Mark them?

01:28:13.784 --> 01:28:15.733
MATT: You could attempt to.

01:28:15.733 --> 01:28:17.305
LAURA: I'm going to attempt to.

01:28:17.305 --> 01:28:21.142
MATT: Okay. You go to attempt Hunter's Mark and as
the energy springs forth from your hand, it hits

01:28:21.142 --> 01:28:26.251
the green wall and scatters across, the arcane
nature of the spell halted immediately.

01:28:26.251 --> 01:28:27.999
LAURA: Yeah, figured as much.

01:28:27.999 --> 01:28:31.279
MATT: Now, at this point, as you're going for the
nearest gem on the wall?

01:28:31.279 --> 01:28:33.379
TRAVIS: Yeah, the same one I had before that
cracked a little.

01:28:33.379 --> 01:28:35.526
MATT: Okay. So go ahead and take another shot.

01:28:35.526 --> 01:28:37.386
TRAVIS: 21.

01:28:37.386 --> 01:28:40.743
MATT: All right. You strike down and slam it. Go
ahead and roll damage.

01:28:40.743 --> 01:28:42.694
SAM: It's one on the wall, yeah?

01:28:42.694 --> 01:28:46.697
TRAVIS: Yeah, same one I hit before. 15 again, no
fire damage.

01:28:46.697 --> 01:28:52.193
MATT: Okay. You strike the gem. This time the gem
shatters. Pieces of it go flying out of the area

01:28:52.193 --> 01:28:58.685
and parts of it turn to dust and chunks hit and
roll down into the acid. The acid, which now is

01:28:58.685 --> 01:29:01.859
about a foot and half, two feet high, and is
slowly rising in the room.

01:29:01.859 --> 01:29:03.093
LAURA: Oh god!

01:29:03.093 --> 01:29:04.532
SAM: I step into the acid.

01:29:04.532 --> 01:29:05.778
MATT: Okay.

01:29:05.778 --> 01:29:10.244
SAM: And I start hitting the one in the center
with my fucking stupid sword.

01:29:10.244 --> 01:29:16.039
LAURA: I shoot my exploding arrow at the glass.

01:29:16.039 --> 01:29:18.645
MATT: At the glass? Okay.

01:29:18.645 --> 01:29:22.188
SAM: Okay. Big arrow?

01:29:22.188 --> 01:29:24.060
LAURA: It's an exploding arrow.

01:29:24.060 --> 01:29:26.640
MATT: You guys watch Vax turn around and begin to
follow the Briarwoods.

01:29:26.640 --> 01:29:36.210
MARISHA: I start talking to Vax. Vax. It's Kiki.
Don't forget who you are. You are stronger than

01:29:36.210 --> 01:29:45.655
this, you are stronger than them. You are not a
Briarwood, you are Vox Machina, and we can't lose

01:29:45.655 --> 01:29:53.672
you. I can't lose you.

01:29:53.672 --> 01:29:55.860
SAM: What was that?

01:29:55.860 --> 01:30:02.149
MARISHA: You're our only hope. Please. You can
overcome this. Please.

01:30:02.149 --> 01:30:04.966
MATT: Scanlan, make an attack roll.

01:30:04.966 --> 01:30:10.530
SAM: 18 plus something, I don't know how to hit
things.

01:30:10.592 --> 01:30:12.988
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and roll your damage with the
sword.

01:30:12.988 --> 01:30:18.105
SAM: Is that a d20? No, it says 1d8 plus three.
Okay, that's not much.

01:30:18.105 --> 01:30:20.188
LAURA: It's something, it's something.

01:30:20.188 --> 01:30:22.480
TRAVIS: Can Pike do something?

01:30:22.480 --> 01:30:27.338
MATT: If Pike wants to. Yeah, you guys are all
together still.

01:30:27.338 --> 01:30:29.029
TRAVIS: Pike, do some cool shit!

01:30:29.029 --> 01:30:30.005
SAM: 11.

01:30:30.005 --> 01:30:34.819
ASHLEY: I'm halfway here. This stupid astral
projection is driving me nuts!

01:30:34.819 --> 01:30:35.910
MATT: Oh no!

01:30:35.910 --> 01:30:37.231
SAM: 11.

01:30:37.231 --> 01:30:43.109
MATT: As you wade into the acid you feel the sting
as it hits your body. You immediately take five

01:30:43.109 --> 01:30:44.548
points of acid damage.

01:30:44.548 --> 01:30:47.021
SAM: I have a potion of acid resistance that I
drank.

01:30:47.021 --> 01:30:54.551
MATT: You did, so you take three. Three points of
acid damage. And you strike down, arcing down as

01:30:54.551 --> 01:30:58.573
it splashes, parts of it go across your face. You
can feel the tingle of it burn the outside of your

01:30:58.573 --> 01:31:01.292
skin, but not enough to really cause any serious
damage.

01:31:01.292 --> 01:31:02.673
SAM: Not the face!

01:31:02.673 --> 01:31:06.677
MATT: But you strike down and you find it hit the
gem and then slide off as it hits, but you feel it

01:31:06.677 --> 01:31:09.919
give a bit on the impact. Anyone else want to do
anything right now?

01:31:09.919 --> 01:31:11.933
LAURA: I was going to shoot the exploding arrow at
the glass door.

01:31:11.933 --> 01:31:13.186
MATT: All right, go ahead and roll the attack.

01:31:13.186 --> 01:31:14.480
LAURA: I did, and it was 22.

01:31:14.480 --> 01:31:21.011
MATT: 22, all right. You release the arrow. It
streaks across the room, hits the glass, and it

01:31:21.011 --> 01:31:25.807
explodes with a reverberating crack. You guys all,
in the middle of trying to figure out this

01:31:25.807 --> 01:31:29.671
scenario, didn't cover your ears in time, and it
nearly deafens you from the blast of the impact

01:31:29.671 --> 01:31:34.711
from the reverberation of the room. However, go
ahead and roll damage on that. Roll arrow damage

01:31:34.711 --> 01:31:38.396
and then an additional 4d6 points of damage.

01:31:38.396 --> 01:31:41.380
LAURA: Oh shit, that would've been so good to have
on them. I'm sorry.

01:31:41.380 --> 01:31:51.694
SAM: As my bonus action, I turn to Percy and I
say, Percy, we're surrounded by metal and glass

01:31:51.694 --> 01:31:54.946
and stone above us. Is there anything we can do to
that stone?

01:31:54.946 --> 01:32:00.408
TALIESIN: Whitestone's pretty strong.

01:32:00.408 --> 01:32:04.421
SAM: Can't it burn? Can't you do things with
stone, Keyleth?

01:32:04.421 --> 01:32:10.358
TRAVIS: You have lightning. Are we going to kill
ourselves if we do that?

01:32:10.358 --> 01:32:15.800
TALIESIN: You could stone, you could get out of
this.

01:32:15.800 --> 01:32:17.367
MATT: So what's the damage on that?

01:32:17.367 --> 01:32:18.805
LAURA: I know.

01:32:18.805 --> 01:32:24.557
MARISHA: I couldn't take Move Earth because we
needed Sunbeam. I have Wall of Stone.

01:32:24.557 --> 01:32:26.029
SAM: What does that do?

01:32:26.029 --> 01:32:27.657
TRAVIS: It could buy us more time if we get on
it.

01:32:27.657 --> 01:32:28.865
LAURA: 43.

01:32:28.865 --> 01:32:37.106
MATT: 43? It hits the glass and as the explosion
settles the smoke rises up and you can see a

01:32:37.106 --> 01:32:42.727
portion of the glass wall about ten feet up,
shards have been chiseled out from the explosion.

01:32:42.727 --> 01:32:46.980
It's taken some damage. Not a heavy amount, but
you can see there has been a portion of the wall

01:32:46.980 --> 01:32:49.375
that has been scraped away.

01:32:49.375 --> 01:32:50.560
TRAVIS: About ten feet up?

01:32:50.560 --> 01:32:51.629
MATT: About ten feet up.

01:32:51.629 --> 01:32:52.521
LAURA: Grog!

01:32:52.521 --> 01:32:54.598
TRAVIS: Can I run over there? I'd have to run
through the acid?

01:32:54.598 --> 01:33:00.552
MATT: You would have to, yeah, unless you want to
try and jump across. You could try and jump across

01:33:00.552 --> 01:33:01.539
if you want to.

01:33:01.539 --> 01:33:07.566
TRAVIS: Yes, I would like to jump across, run
over, and start swinging on that section.

01:33:07.566 --> 01:33:08.425
MATT: Okay.

01:33:08.425 --> 01:33:09.775
SAM: What side is this? On the ceiling?

01:33:09.775 --> 01:33:11.892
LAURA: This is on the side that they left
through.

01:33:11.892 --> 01:33:12.942
SAM: Okay.

01:33:12.942 --> 01:33:15.365
MATT: Which, the door is now closed, by the way,
and Vax is nowhere in sight.

01:33:15.365 --> 01:33:16.720
LAURA: The door closed again?

01:33:16.720 --> 01:33:19.991
TRAVIS: Can I do great weapon master and hit it
three times?

01:33:19.991 --> 01:33:22.792
MATT: Yeah.

01:33:22.792 --> 01:33:23.809
TRAVIS: Yeah?

01:33:23.809 --> 01:33:27.498
MATT: Scanlan? Are you making another strike at
the gem?

01:33:27.498 --> 01:33:28.793
SAM: Absolutely, is it my turn again?

01:33:28.793 --> 01:33:31.912
MATT: This is all fluid. We'll pull it up as you
go, and you're taking your shot.

01:33:31.912 --> 01:33:35.821
TALIESIN: I'm taking three shots at one of the
gems on the wall.

01:33:35.821 --> 01:33:36.906
MATT: Okay, go for it.

01:33:36.906 --> 01:33:37.953
SAM: 17 to hit.

01:33:37.953 --> 01:33:39.232
MATT: Hits, go ahead and roll damage.

01:33:39.232 --> 01:33:40.274
SAM: Ten.

01:33:40.274 --> 01:33:44.937
MATT: Ten. You strike down a second time, the acid
now beginning to rise; the level's almost up to

01:33:44.937 --> 01:33:50.280
your chest, and it's a little harder for you to
swing, but you still manage to strike true. You

01:33:50.280 --> 01:33:54.455
take four points of acid damage, but you can feel
the damage itself is mounting. It's growing with

01:33:54.455 --> 01:33:59.575
each progressive amount of you that is currently
submerged. You strike down, thankfully the liquid

01:33:59.575 --> 01:34:02.819
isn't too thick and you still manage to push
through most of your force, your magical blade

01:34:02.819 --> 01:34:07.502
guiding it down to the gem, and you feel it
(crack) beneath you. Crack and shatter.

01:34:07.502 --> 01:34:08.930
SAM: One down.

01:34:08.930 --> 01:34:10.058
MATT: One down.

01:34:10.058 --> 01:34:11.245
TALIESIN: We have two down.

01:34:11.245 --> 01:34:13.027
MATT: Oh, sorry. Two down, between the two of
you.

01:34:13.027 --> 01:34:15.499
MARISHA: Do there appear to be any weak points in
the metal anywhere?

01:34:15.499 --> 01:34:19.853
MATT: Not that you can tell at a quick glance.
Everything's pretty solid, and it's been used

01:34:19.853 --> 01:34:25.631
multiple times, and you see now that this room is
used, and what they used to melt down all the

01:34:25.631 --> 01:34:30.684
whitestone into the residuum component during
the construction of the ziggurat. Some of the

01:34:30.756 --> 01:34:36.640
notes mentioned it, Ripley mentioned a little bit,
but this-- this is bad.

01:34:36.640 --> 01:34:38.439
SAM: Acid melts whitestone?

01:34:38.439 --> 01:34:40.201
MATT: It appears to, yeah.

01:34:40.201 --> 01:34:42.728
SAM: The whitestone on the ceiling?

01:34:42.728 --> 01:34:49.492
MARISHA: The acid that's filling in melts that?
Okay, well, that changes things. Does my Control

01:34:49.492 --> 01:34:51.892
Water spell, would that work with the acid?

01:34:51.892 --> 01:34:57.684
MATT: There's such a little water component that
that spell is used to focusing on, it would be a

01:34:57.684 --> 01:35:05.364
little hard for you to do that in enough of amount
to actually do any serious effect, unfortunately.

01:35:05.364 --> 01:35:07.359
LAURA: Does the acid go through glass?

01:35:07.359 --> 01:35:12.546
TALIESIN: No. Glass is specifically how you
contain acid.

01:35:12.546 --> 01:35:21.202
LAURA: Can I take one of my glass vials that I
have and try to get some acid and put it up on the

01:35:21.202 --> 01:35:22.332
ceiling?

01:35:22.332 --> 01:35:25.061
MATT: You can definitely fill it up, but it's a
ways up.

01:35:25.061 --> 01:35:26.404
LAURA: I'm flying.

01:35:26.404 --> 01:35:27.413
MATT: Oh, yeah!

01:35:27.413 --> 01:35:28.472
SAM: You're flying?

01:35:28.472 --> 01:35:30.470
LAURA: I took a flying potion to get out of the
acid.

01:35:30.470 --> 01:35:36.514
MATT: So you bolt down, and it's still pouring in.
The ice on the other side, by the way, shatters as

01:35:36.514 --> 01:35:40.377
it now continues to pour in from both sides,
doubling the speed at which it's filling.

01:35:40.377 --> 01:35:42.278
TALIESIN: I'm taking my three shots at the next
gem.

01:35:42.278 --> 01:35:43.446
MATT: Go for it.

01:35:43.446 --> 01:35:45.533
LAURA: Am I high enough that I can see where the
pipes are coming in at?

01:35:45.533 --> 01:35:46.456
MATT: Yeah.

01:35:46.456 --> 01:35:50.179
LAURA: So I could potentially grab hold of one of
the pipes on the ceiling and try to move it?

01:35:50.179 --> 01:35:51.225
MATT: You could, yeah.

01:35:51.225 --> 01:35:54.512
LAURA: I want to try to grab hold of one of those
pipes and aim it toward the ceiling,

01:35:54.512 --> 01:35:55.730
if I can move it.

01:35:55.730 --> 01:35:57.343
MATT: Okay. We'll get to that in just a moment.

01:35:57.343 --> 01:36:00.424
TALIESIN: The first one was 21.

01:36:00.424 --> 01:36:01.464
MATT: Okay.

01:36:01.464 --> 01:36:05.840
TALIESIN: And then the second shot-- dear god, it
hits.

01:36:05.922 --> 01:36:07.586
MARISHA: He rolled an 18.

01:36:07.586 --> 01:36:09.361
TALIESIN: 18, 20, 30.

01:36:09.361 --> 01:36:10.503
MATT: All right.

01:36:10.503 --> 01:36:12.529
TALIESIN: Third shot is 26.

01:36:12.529 --> 01:36:15.231
MATT: All right. All three hit. Roll damage for
all of those.

01:36:15.231 --> 01:36:19.830
TALIESIN: That's 14.

01:36:19.830 --> 01:36:21.274
MATT: Okay.

01:36:21.274 --> 01:36:28.950
TALIESIN: 11 for the second shot, and 14 for the
third shot.

01:36:28.950 --> 01:36:34.487
MATT: All right. (three gun blasts) You unload
three bullets in a row. You see, before even the

01:36:34.487 --> 01:36:40.985
last one hits, the opal itself (crash) shatters
off from the final blast, leaving the vacuous hole

01:36:40.985 --> 01:36:47.490
where it once was embedded in the wall. Vex, you
move up and you grab onto it. You begin to try and

01:36:47.490 --> 01:36:51.535
shove it, and even with your Fly spell, you don't
have a lot of weight behind it, so you put

01:36:51.535 --> 01:36:58.003
yourself up against the wall, find some leverage
against one of the metal bars that holds the metal

01:36:58.003 --> 01:37:01.656
plates in place, and you lift. I need you to make
a strength check.

01:37:01.656 --> 01:37:04.422
LAURA: I'm the weakest!

01:37:04.422 --> 01:37:05.821
LIAM: Not this time.

01:37:05.821 --> 01:37:09.503
LAURA: Do I get advantage?

01:37:09.503 --> 01:37:11.915
MATT: Not for this, you don't.

01:37:11.915 --> 01:37:13.339
LAURA: Damn it.

01:37:13.339 --> 01:37:15.280
MARISHA: Can I help her out?

01:37:15.280 --> 01:37:22.380
LAURA: Get those Boots of Levitation. Get them on!
Fly up, because I just rolled a fucking zero.

01:37:22.380 --> 01:37:25.376
Literally a zero.

01:37:25.376 --> 01:37:36.122
MATT: You grab it, and as you're holding onto it,
it's pliable. It's not a very hard metal, but you

01:37:36.122 --> 01:37:39.947
just don't have the strength, physically, in this
one attempt to bend it in any way,

01:37:39.947 --> 01:37:41.085
shape, or form.

01:37:41.085 --> 01:37:43.602
LAURA: Can I use my dagger that I have?

01:37:43.602 --> 01:37:49.846
MARISHA: Hold on. Use your dagger, and seeing what
she's doing, I'm going to cast my Heat Metal spell

01:37:49.846 --> 01:37:52.436
on it, and start heating and melting it.

01:37:52.436 --> 01:37:53.723
LAURA: The pipe?

01:37:53.723 --> 01:37:54.852
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:37:54.852 --> 01:37:59.974
MATT: So you reach over and cast Heat Metal. The
pipe section sticks out about two and a half feet

01:37:59.974 --> 01:38:04.001
from this point, so you can grasp it there. You
look over and see the metal itself beginning to

01:38:04.001 --> 01:38:05.442
heat up, beginning to glow.

01:38:05.442 --> 01:38:07.007
LAURA: Can I try to lift it?

01:38:07.007 --> 01:38:08.343
MATT: You can.

01:38:08.343 --> 01:38:12.059
LAURA: I wrap my hands in cloth, and then I do
it.

01:38:12.059 --> 01:38:15.282
MATT: Okay, so you take your cloak and wrap it up.
Good call. What are you doing?

01:38:15.282 --> 01:38:25.024
SAM: I say to everybody, when Cassandra put her
hand on the hidden gem outside the glass, it

01:38:25.024 --> 01:38:26.580
closed the doors, right?

01:38:26.580 --> 01:38:27.551
LAURA: Yeah.

01:38:27.551 --> 01:38:31.663
SAM: If I put my hands on that while you're
putting your hands on the inside gems, it might

01:38:31.663 --> 01:38:33.279
open the doors, right?

01:38:33.279 --> 01:38:34.638
LAURA: Potentially, but we destroyed them.

01:38:34.638 --> 01:38:35.635
MARISHA: We destroyed two.

01:38:35.635 --> 01:38:38.682
SAM: Yeah, but maybe if we do the other ones, it
would still work? Is it worth a shot?

01:38:38.682 --> 01:38:40.040
LAURA: Can you Dimension Door?

01:38:40.040 --> 01:38:41.453
SAM: I could.

01:38:41.525 --> 01:38:42.845
TRAVIS: Can you take some people with you?

01:38:42.845 --> 01:38:44.264
SAM: No. I can take Pike.

01:38:44.264 --> 01:38:45.100
LAURA: Take Pike.

01:38:45.100 --> 01:38:46.526
MATT: You can take one person.

01:38:46.526 --> 01:38:47.722
SAM: Of my height.

01:38:47.722 --> 01:38:49.289
MATT: Of your size. Medium creatures.

01:38:49.289 --> 01:38:52.562
SAM: Oh, my size, not my height?

01:38:52.562 --> 01:38:55.081
MATT: Well, you are, as a gnome, a small creature,
aren't you?

01:38:55.081 --> 01:38:57.227
LAURA: But he's Percy-sized right now.

01:38:57.227 --> 01:38:58.261
MATT: Pretty sure.

01:38:58.261 --> 01:38:59.706
TALIESIN: Well, it's fake, though.

01:38:59.706 --> 01:39:01.243
LAURA: Oh, right.

01:39:01.243 --> 01:39:05.203
MATT: Let me double-check this real fast. Yeah, a
gnome's considered small, so it would have to be a

01:39:05.203 --> 01:39:06.202
small creature, for you.

01:39:06.202 --> 01:39:07.445
SAM: I can take Pike.

01:39:07.445 --> 01:39:08.603
ASHLEY: All right, let's go.

01:39:08.603 --> 01:39:09.992
LAURA: Do it!

01:39:09.992 --> 01:39:10.935
SAM: Wait, no.

01:39:10.935 --> 01:39:12.078
LAURA: Just try it.

01:39:12.078 --> 01:39:14.453
SAM: There's four of us in here, and four gems
left.

01:39:14.453 --> 01:39:15.771
MARISHA: How many gems are left inside?

01:39:15.771 --> 01:39:20.513
TALIESIN: Four. But it could be that that's the
only gem that's necessary.

01:39:20.513 --> 01:39:26.423
SAM: Or I could go outside the stone door and see
if there's any more buttons out there to press.

01:39:26.423 --> 01:39:29.897
MARISHA: I think going outside is a good idea. Go
outside.

01:39:29.897 --> 01:39:31.663
MATT: Grog, do you want to make your strikes?

01:39:31.663 --> 01:39:33.150
SAM: Pike, shall I take you with me?

01:39:33.150 --> 01:39:34.277
ASHLEY: Yes, let's go!

01:39:34.277 --> 01:39:35.618
LAURA: Go.

01:39:35.618 --> 01:39:40.243
SAM: The best thing I've ever heard. You and me
in a room alone together.

01:39:40.269 --> 01:39:45.194
TRAVIS: 13, 17, and 13.

01:39:45.194 --> 01:39:46.773
MATT: First two hit.

01:39:46.773 --> 01:39:51.232
TRAVIS: No, it was 15, 20, and 23 on the hits.
That was the damage.

01:39:51.232 --> 01:39:55.613
MATT: That was for the damage? Oh, got you. So as
you slam into it and slam into it, with each

01:39:55.613 --> 01:40:02.289
progressive hit, you can see the glass itself is
gliding off the blade. You're doing bits of

01:40:02.289 --> 01:40:06.161
damage, but it's going to take you a while. You
could get through this in about ten minutes, but

01:40:06.161 --> 01:40:11.238
right now the acid has lifted to the point where
the next round, everyone's going to start being

01:40:11.238 --> 01:40:13.270
submerged.

01:40:13.270 --> 01:40:21.581
SAM: I take Pike by the hands and I will Dimension
Door out through the glass to where she put her

01:40:21.581 --> 01:40:23.656
hand on the hidden gem. Is that right?

01:40:23.656 --> 01:40:29.450
MATT: Okay. You step out of the acid. It's
dripping off the lower half of your body. This

01:40:29.450 --> 01:40:31.987
sizzling smoke is pouring off your body.

01:40:31.987 --> 01:40:35.395
SAM: My leather pants are singed!

01:40:35.466 --> 01:40:36.791
(laughter)

01:40:36.791 --> 01:40:44.661
MATT: Don't Lenny Kravitz this. You walk up the
ramp, you grab Pike, and the two of you appear on

01:40:44.661 --> 01:40:50.090
the other side of the glass door, up on the
platform where Cassandra pressed the final gem.

01:40:50.090 --> 01:40:56.341
SAM: Pike, now's a good time to talk about us,
don't you think? No, I'll just put

01:40:56.341 --> 01:40:58.274
my hand on the gem.

01:40:58.274 --> 01:40:59.978
ASHLEY: Scanlan, not now!

01:40:59.978 --> 01:41:01.196
SAM: Okay!

01:41:01.196 --> 01:41:06.716
MATT: You put your hand on the gem, and put your
hand away for a second and see the gem itself is

01:41:06.716 --> 01:41:10.260
glowing, but does not seem to be--

01:41:10.332 --> 01:41:14.836
SAM: Try to put your hands on the other
non-destroyed gems!

01:41:14.918 --> 01:41:17.176
MATT: Make another strength check now, with the
Heat Metal.

01:41:17.176 --> 01:41:18.542
LAURA: Okay.

01:41:18.542 --> 01:41:20.124
TRAVIS: I'm running over to the other gems.

01:41:20.124 --> 01:41:21.611
MARISHA: Come on, Vex.

01:41:21.611 --> 01:41:23.849
LAURA: That's way better! 13?

01:41:23.849 --> 01:41:28.533
MATT: 13? Okay, with the help of the Heat Metal,
which managed to make the metal more pliable, you

01:41:28.533 --> 01:41:33.032
do still take three points of fire damage because
the metal itself is burning, and you're putting

01:41:33.032 --> 01:41:37.610
your weight against it and pushing against the
edge of the wall, but you pull it up, and it

01:41:37.610 --> 01:41:43.263
begins arcing upward, and you push it over in the
direction of the wall where he is.

01:41:43.263 --> 01:41:44.992
LAURA: Yeah, at the ceiling.

01:41:44.992 --> 01:41:50.638
MATT: Yeah. There is force just pushing it
outward. As it arcs over, it starts splattering

01:41:50.638 --> 01:41:56.166
across the whitestone on the ceiling. As it hits,
the whitestone dissolves and you can see it's

01:41:56.166 --> 01:41:59.241
causing these huge pockmarks in the actual stone
above the glass.

01:41:59.241 --> 01:42:00.259
SAM: Do that more.

01:42:00.259 --> 01:42:01.666
LAURA: I keep doing it.

01:42:01.666 --> 01:42:05.933
MARISHA: I'm going to switch my Heat Metal spell
over to the other spigot.

01:42:05.933 --> 01:42:09.224
LAURA: And I fly over to the other side and do the
same thing.

01:42:09.310 --> 01:42:12.981
MATT: Okay. It's not hitting the whole ceiling.
You could probably take another round to keep

01:42:12.981 --> 01:42:16.094
directing it, if you want to. It's up to you. You
could either keep directing this one, because

01:42:16.094 --> 01:42:17.971
right now it's just starting to hit the ceiling.

01:42:17.971 --> 01:42:19.174
LAURA: I'll keep directing it.

01:42:19.174 --> 01:42:21.834
MATT: Okay. Moving it over there. What are you
doing?

01:42:21.834 --> 01:42:23.530
TRAVIS: I'm running over to the gem.

01:42:23.530 --> 01:42:25.093
SAM: Put your hands on the gems!

01:42:25.093 --> 01:42:26.466
TALIESIN: I'm running over to a gem.

01:42:26.466 --> 01:42:28.490
MATT: Okay. You guys make your attacks on separate
gems.

01:42:28.490 --> 01:42:31.000
TRAVIS: No, we're going to put our hands on the
gem, right?

01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:32.010
MATT: You're putting hands on it?

01:42:32.010 --> 01:42:34.112
TALIESIN: I'm going to hands-on and see if
anything happens, and if nothing does, I'm going

01:42:34.112 --> 01:42:35.487
to pull out my sword and start whacking it.

01:42:35.487 --> 01:42:37.163
MATT: Okay. You guys run up and put your hands on
the gems.

01:42:37.163 --> 01:42:38.413
SAM: Can they get two gems each?

01:42:38.413 --> 01:42:40.340
MATT: They've both gotten two gems each, yeah.

01:42:40.340 --> 01:42:41.627
SAM: And my hand is on--

01:42:41.627 --> 01:42:42.874
MATT: On the bottom gem.

01:42:42.874 --> 01:42:44.537
SAM: Come on, work, damn it.

01:42:44.537 --> 01:42:50.299
MATT: You could, yeah. You could probably get one
gem. There's only four gems left.

01:42:50.299 --> 01:42:54.520
SAM: Could Trinket do the other one? Where's
Trinket?

01:42:54.520 --> 01:42:57.563
MATT: Trinket is up against the wall on the sides,
very scared right now.

01:42:57.563 --> 01:42:59.054
SAM and TALIESIN: We need a fourth hand!

01:42:59.054 --> 01:43:02.708
MARISHA: Oh, okay! Still keeping my Heat Metal
spell up.

01:43:02.708 --> 01:43:06.865
MATT: You place all of your hands on the gems? No
apparent effect.

01:43:06.865 --> 01:43:07.949
MARISHA: Fuck!

01:43:07.949 --> 01:43:09.399
TALIESIN: I pull out my sword and start whacking
it.

01:43:09.399 --> 01:43:10.542
TRAVIS: Fuck you, gem!

01:43:10.542 --> 01:43:11.702
MATT: Make another strength check.

01:43:11.702 --> 01:43:14.379
LAURA: Shitballs. We're going to die.

01:43:14.379 --> 01:43:19.260
LIAM: Guys, the Briarwoods' personal quarters are
really plush. They're sick.

01:43:19.260 --> 01:43:20.711
LAURA: (laughs) I rolled a zero!

01:43:20.711 --> 01:43:22.070
MATT: You rolled zero again?

01:43:22.070 --> 01:43:23.729
(laughter)

01:43:23.729 --> 01:43:27.630
MATT: You can't quite move the metal enough this
time. It's still arcing, and it's spattering

01:43:27.630 --> 01:43:32.532
against the glass. No effect on the glass, but
it's starting to hit elements of the ceiling. You

01:43:32.532 --> 01:43:39.024
can see the stone is being eaten away. At this
point, everyone who's currently on the ground

01:43:39.024 --> 01:43:45.343
suffers three points of acid damage, as it's now
beginning to reach up to your shins.

01:43:45.343 --> 01:43:47.443
You take two.

01:43:47.443 --> 01:43:48.663
SAM: No, I'm out!

01:43:48.663 --> 01:43:52.386
MATT: I forgot, you're outside. You're fine. Pike,
you don't, because you and Scanlan are outside of

01:43:52.386 --> 01:43:53.286
the room.

01:43:53.286 --> 01:43:54.239
TRAVIS: And I'm resistant.

01:43:54.239 --> 01:43:55.804
MATT: Yeah, so you take two.

01:43:55.804 --> 01:44:03.705
SAM: Pike, my love. Is there any way you can get
to the other side of this stone wall to see what's

01:44:03.705 --> 01:44:05.034
over there?

01:44:05.034 --> 01:44:07.095
TALIESIN: Break your gem!

01:44:07.095 --> 01:44:08.365
SAM: Break my gem?

01:44:08.365 --> 01:44:10.266
TALIESIN: The outside gem. Break the outside gem!

01:44:10.266 --> 01:44:12.166
MATT: You hear Percy yelling from the other side.

01:44:12.166 --> 01:44:14.168
TALIESIN: (shouting) Break the outside gem!

01:44:14.168 --> 01:44:15.845
SAM: All I hear is, (muffled noises).

01:44:15.845 --> 01:44:18.040
TALIESIN: (muffled) Just fucking break the gem!

01:44:18.040 --> 01:44:19.439
LAURA: Break the outside gem!

01:44:19.439 --> 01:44:22.293
SAM: I think Percy wants us to kiss, Pike.

01:44:22.293 --> 01:44:25.873
TALIESIN: (muffled) Kiss?! No, I just want you to
break the goddamn thing!

01:44:25.873 --> 01:44:27.864
SAM: He said the power of love will inspire him?

01:44:27.864 --> 01:44:29.565
TALIESIN: (muffled) Fuck the power of love!

01:44:29.565 --> 01:44:32.820
(laughter)

01:44:32.820 --> 01:44:38.089
ASHLEY: I take my hand and I Guiding Bolt the top
of the gem.

01:44:38.089 --> 01:44:45.181
MATT: Okay. Roll a spell attack-- or for Guiding
Bolt is it a saving throw?

01:44:45.181 --> 01:44:47.246
ASHLEY: One more time? Sorry, I can't hear you
very well.

01:44:47.246 --> 01:44:49.536
MATT: I can't remember if it's a saving throw or
not for Guiding Bolt. Let me check.

01:44:49.536 --> 01:44:51.399
LAURA: Maybe you could hit it with a mace, Pike.

01:44:51.399 --> 01:44:56.505
MATT: Guiding Bolt-- yeah, make a ranged spell
attack. With advantage, because it's right in

01:44:56.505 --> 01:44:57.595
front of your hand.

01:44:57.595 --> 01:44:58.908
ASHLEY: Okay.

01:44:58.908 --> 01:45:03.144
MATT: So roll two d20s, take the higher of the
two, and add your spell attack modifier.

01:45:03.144 --> 01:45:04.773
LIAM: Cold as ice, Mercer.

01:45:04.773 --> 01:45:06.993
TALIESIN: (laughs)

01:45:06.993 --> 01:45:09.787
TRAVIS: We're hitting gems, too.

01:45:09.787 --> 01:45:11.797
ASHLEY: 16.

01:45:11.797 --> 01:45:13.552
SAM: What did you say, Ashley?

01:45:13.552 --> 01:45:14.616
ASHLEY: 16.

01:45:14.616 --> 01:45:16.224
SAM: She said 16.

01:45:16.224 --> 01:45:19.932
MATT: 16. Yeah, that's easy enough. Roll your
damage for your Guiding Bolt. It's 4d6 radiant

01:45:19.932 --> 01:45:21.006
damage.

01:45:21.006 --> 01:45:22.070
LAURA: 4d6.

01:45:22.070 --> 01:45:23.019
ASHLEY: Okay.

01:45:23.019 --> 01:45:24.388
TALIESIN: I'm hitting my gem, too.

01:45:24.388 --> 01:45:26.186
MATT: Okay. Roll damage.

01:45:26.186 --> 01:45:31.902
LAURA: I'm trying really hard to lift this pipe
with my scrawny little arms.

01:45:31.902 --> 01:45:33.513
MATT: Make another strength check.

01:45:33.513 --> 01:45:34.676
TRAVIS: 17.

01:45:34.676 --> 01:45:35.917
LAURA: Oh no.

01:45:35.917 --> 01:45:37.401
MATT: (glass breaking noise) Your gem shatters.

01:45:37.401 --> 01:45:39.577
TALIESIN: I rolled a 30 to hit.

01:45:39.577 --> 01:45:40.727
MATT: Yeah, that hits.

01:45:40.727 --> 01:45:41.752
LAURA: 12 for strength.

01:45:41.752 --> 01:45:47.989
MATT: 12 for strength? You manage to move it to
the side. You take two points of fire damage as

01:45:48.081 --> 01:45:52.093
the heat from the actual metal itself is starting
to push through the leather, and you can feel it

01:45:52.093 --> 01:45:53.568
burning the edge of your skin.

01:45:53.568 --> 01:45:54.520
LAURA: Okay.

01:45:54.520 --> 01:45:59.340
MATT: But you do arc it over a little further, and
it's now (splatter noise) pouring onto the ceiling

01:45:59.340 --> 01:46:07.941
and splashing over and down over the glass wall.
You can see, the stonework is melting through and

01:46:07.941 --> 01:46:13.488
after a few seconds of this, you begin to see the
top of where the glass wall ends.

01:46:13.488 --> 01:46:15.015
SAM: Get over it!

01:46:15.015 --> 01:46:22.972
MATT: As the wall dissipates and the acid begins
to push through the rest of the whitestone, you

01:46:22.972 --> 01:46:29.523
guys look up and you can see the ceiling above you
begin to turn dark for a second before part begins

01:46:29.523 --> 01:46:32.664
to (dripping noises) drip acid into the small
chamber that the two of you

01:46:32.664 --> 01:46:34.477
currently are standing in.

01:46:34.477 --> 01:46:38.009
ASHLEY: Total of 20.

01:46:38.009 --> 01:46:43.245
MATT: Total of 20 damage? Yeah, the gem on the
ground before you (glass breaking noise) shatters

01:46:43.245 --> 01:46:45.526
with a blast of radiant energy.

01:46:45.526 --> 01:46:47.895
SAM: And does the stone door behind us open?

01:46:47.895 --> 01:46:51.026
MATT: You still have one more gem left. It's the
one you were touching.

01:46:51.026 --> 01:46:52.665
LAURA: Oh! We have another gem. Hit it!

01:46:52.665 --> 01:46:53.915
MARISHA: The one I was touching?

01:46:53.915 --> 01:46:55.685
MATT: What are you doing, Keyleth?

01:46:55.685 --> 01:47:00.577
MARISHA: I'm going to put my hand on it and do--

01:47:00.577 --> 01:47:02.337
SAM: Squeeze Gem.

01:47:02.337 --> 01:47:10.176
MARISHA: I'm going to do another Thunderwave. Bam!
See if I can Thunderwave crack it.

01:47:10.176 --> 01:47:11.721
TALIESIN: These things are really easy to kill.

01:47:11.721 --> 01:47:13.563
LAURA: Yeah, that's a lot of energy.

01:47:13.563 --> 01:47:15.912
MATT: Roll damage on the Thunderwave.

01:47:15.912 --> 01:47:18.080
MARISHA: They get killed by not a lot, or a lot?

01:47:18.080 --> 01:47:20.348
TALIESIN: They get killed by hitting them with
your fist.

01:47:20.348 --> 01:47:21.688
TRAVIS: Or your staff.

01:47:21.688 --> 01:47:24.477
MARISHA: 11 points of damage.

01:47:24.477 --> 01:47:27.920
MATT: 11 points of damage? Okay. Thunderwave
(explosion noise) resounds off, and you see the

01:47:27.920 --> 01:47:30.979
gem crack in place, but it's still held in its
current position in the wall.

01:47:30.979 --> 01:47:32.163
TRAVIS: Hit it!

01:47:32.163 --> 01:47:33.369
LAURA: Hit it with your staff!

01:47:33.369 --> 01:47:38.399
MATT: At this point in time, as you guys finish
this, the ceiling begins to open into a tunnel

01:47:38.460 --> 01:47:41.497
above you, and acid begins to fill the room that
both of you guys are in.

01:47:41.558 --> 01:47:43.018
SAM: Me and Pike?

01:47:43.018 --> 01:47:44.369
MATT: Yeah, both of you guys.

01:47:44.369 --> 01:47:46.493
TALIESIN: Did I finish killing my gem?

01:47:46.493 --> 01:47:47.623
MATT: You did, yes.

01:47:47.623 --> 01:47:54.676
TALIESIN: Okay, I'm going to take a shot, if I
have anything else to do. Can I take a shot at the

01:47:54.676 --> 01:47:56.105
gem that she just cracked?

01:47:56.105 --> 01:47:57.008
MATT: Yep.

01:47:57.008 --> 01:47:58.801
LAURA: Does it look like a big enough tunnel now
that I can move the pipe?

01:47:58.801 --> 01:48:03.712
MATT: Right now, a person could climb through over
top of the green wall.

01:48:03.712 --> 01:48:04.929
SAM: A goliath?

01:48:04.929 --> 01:48:06.102
LAURA: And a bear?

01:48:06.102 --> 01:48:09.244
MATT: At this point, the way you've been leaning
over and it is slopping over, you could probably

01:48:09.244 --> 01:48:12.757
squeeze them through. A bear, you'd have to push
Winnie the Pooh-style, but it's doable.

01:48:12.757 --> 01:48:14.919
TALIESIN: 18?

01:48:14.919 --> 01:48:16.119
MATT: 18 hits, yeah.

01:48:16.119 --> 01:48:18.293
TALIESIN: That's 16 points of damage.

01:48:18.293 --> 01:48:22.497
MATT: (shattering noise) The last gem shatters
from the blast of the gun. Pieces of the opal

01:48:22.497 --> 01:48:32.042
scatter across your face, Keyleth. Not enough to
cut you. At which point, the green stone wall

01:48:32.042 --> 01:48:38.920
behind you, (scraping noise) lifts up, revealing
the room behind you. The one in front of you tries

01:48:38.920 --> 01:48:44.230
to lift up, and is caught because currently, part
of the stone that lifts it up has been dissolved.

01:48:44.230 --> 01:48:47.616
SAM: (laughs) We're smart.

01:48:47.616 --> 01:48:56.011
MATT: Pike and Scanlan, you guys currently, in
that room, suffer three points of acid damage as

01:48:56.011 --> 01:48:58.255
your side of the room is now filling up with
acid.

01:48:58.255 --> 01:48:59.569
LAURA: Dimension Door out, again!

01:48:59.569 --> 01:49:02.635
SAM: Three points? Mine's halved, right, so it's
two?

01:49:02.635 --> 01:49:03.791
MATT: Yeah.

01:49:03.791 --> 01:49:10.289
MARISHA: Okay, out of frustration, I see this, can
I do a wall of stone from underneath the glass to

01:49:10.289 --> 01:49:12.258
try and lift it up?

01:49:12.258 --> 01:49:21.553
MATT: Yeah. Okay. Go ahead and roll a d20 and add
your wisdom check.

01:49:21.553 --> 01:49:28.985
MARISHA: Not great. Oh! I get advantage on wisdom,
right?

01:49:28.985 --> 01:49:31.103
MATT: It's not a wisdom save.

01:49:31.103 --> 01:49:35.142
MARISHA: Fucking shit. Balls. Wisdom. Just
wisdom?

01:49:35.142 --> 01:49:36.514
MATT: Just wisdom.

01:49:36.514 --> 01:49:37.696
MARISHA: Eight.

01:49:37.696 --> 01:49:43.441
MATT: Eight? You use your Wall of Stone spell. You
feel there is the stone surface beneath the

01:49:43.441 --> 01:49:48.436
bronze. You can sense, as the stone begins to push
up from the whitestone beneath the bronze plates,

01:49:48.436 --> 01:49:52.852
and it (impact noise) hits, and it's not strong
enough to force its way through. Both the bronze

01:49:52.852 --> 01:49:55.072
plating, and the wall itself.

01:49:55.072 --> 01:49:58.305
MARISHA: Bye, 5th-level spell.

01:49:58.305 --> 01:50:01.258
TRAVIS: Can we lower a rope and get over the glass
now that there's a little space?

01:50:01.258 --> 01:50:02.474
LAURA: Yeah.

01:50:02.474 --> 01:50:06.163
MATT: Roll a strength check to try to bend it
away, if you want to.

01:50:06.163 --> 01:50:09.119
MARISHA: I've still got that Heat Metal up.

01:50:09.119 --> 01:50:10.250
LAURA: Nine.

01:50:10.250 --> 01:50:11.705
MATT: With the Heat Metal?

01:50:11.705 --> 01:50:13.277
MARISHA: It's still up. It's a concentration
spell, yeah.

01:50:13.277 --> 01:50:15.930
MATT: You start moving it away.

01:50:15.930 --> 01:50:18.123
LAURA: I kick it with my foot to move it out of
the way.

01:50:18.123 --> 01:50:22.301
MATT: You're pushing as hard as you can. It's
shifting, but it's going to take you another round

01:50:22.301 --> 01:50:26.761
to move it over. Pike and Scanlan--

01:50:26.761 --> 01:50:30.851
LAURA: I'm like Chun Lee, my legs are so strong.

01:50:30.851 --> 01:50:39.015
MATT: You are, technically. That's only one point
of acid damage to both of you because these d6 are

01:50:39.015 --> 01:50:42.743
rolling crap. But this is the second round because
it's filling up, so it's two of those. And I

01:50:42.743 --> 01:50:46.818
rolled a one! So two points of acid, but you take
one because you're halved. So two points of acid

01:50:46.818 --> 01:50:51.210
damage to you, Pike. You're now up to about waist
high in this acid that's beginning to burn through

01:50:51.210 --> 01:50:52.382
and dissolve.

01:50:52.382 --> 01:51:00.263
Who's doing what now? Anything? Anyone else, or
are you just waiting on these guys to finish with

01:51:00.263 --> 01:51:01.858
their actions?

01:51:01.955 --> 01:51:03.845
SAM: Should I get out of here and try to start
working on the stone?

01:51:03.845 --> 01:51:06.705
LAURA: Go on the other side so you can open up the
door that leads out.

01:51:06.705 --> 01:51:14.491
TALIESIN: Wait, I'm so sorry, how far out is the
acid room from where we are right now?

01:51:14.491 --> 01:51:17.366
MATT: You mean the room they're in?

01:51:17.366 --> 01:51:19.596
TALIESIN: No, the room that the acid is stored
in.

01:51:19.596 --> 01:51:22.622
MATT: You don't know, actually. Oh, you mean the
one that was way back?

01:51:22.622 --> 01:51:23.356
TALIESIN: Yeah.

01:51:23.356 --> 01:51:24.458
MATT: That was quite a ways away.

01:51:24.458 --> 01:51:25.427
TALIESIN: Oh, damn it. Okay.

01:51:25.427 --> 01:51:26.524
MATT: It's probably a mile behind you.

01:51:26.524 --> 01:51:30.734
SAM: Pike, is there any way you can get through
this stone wall to the other side

01:51:30.734 --> 01:51:31.934
to see what's there?

01:51:31.934 --> 01:51:35.298
LAURA: Oh, yeah! You're made of jelly. Can you do
it?

01:51:35.298 --> 01:51:38.948
SAM: Oh no, we can't hear you.

01:51:38.948 --> 01:51:40.879
MATT: Hold on, we can't hear you.

01:51:40.879 --> 01:51:42.849
SAM: The darkness is consuming her.

01:51:42.849 --> 01:51:47.266
LIAM: Oh no, she's muted. Hanging up and calling
you back.

01:51:47.266 --> 01:51:50.446
MATT: Roll a perception check.

01:51:50.446 --> 01:51:52.250
SAM: Who, me?

01:51:52.250 --> 01:51:55.798
MATT: Yes.

01:51:55.798 --> 01:52:00.582
LIAM: I am having some fabulous dark chocolate
right now. It is so good.

01:52:00.582 --> 01:52:01.967
They're feeding it to me.

01:52:01.967 --> 01:52:04.594
MATT: Can we hear you, Ashley? There we go.

01:52:04.594 --> 01:52:05.751
SAM: Four.

01:52:05.751 --> 01:52:06.821
MATT: Okay.

01:52:06.891 --> 01:52:08.065
ASHLEY: Okay.

01:52:08.065 --> 01:52:10.584
MATT: Pike, roll a perception check.

01:52:10.796 --> 01:52:14.877
ASHLEY: Okay. Sorry, guys! I don't know what's
going on.

01:52:14.877 --> 01:52:16.281
SAM: It's the evil.

01:52:16.281 --> 01:52:20.444
ASHLEY: I know, it's the evil! It's so strong! I
rolled a 19.

01:52:20.444 --> 01:52:25.369
MATT: Okay. As the acid's pouring and you're
looking about, you notice that the acid level

01:52:25.369 --> 01:52:31.733
raised to a certain point, and doesn't seem to be
continuing. Actually, glancing over, you see the

01:52:31.733 --> 01:52:37.087
door that the Briarwoods left out of, behind you,
is made of whitestone, and the acid that has

01:52:37.087 --> 01:52:40.732
filled this chamber, which is usually sealed off by
the glass wall that has now spilled over through

01:52:40.732 --> 01:52:48.099
the ceiling, has actually dissolved through the
bottom of the door. At this time, it's begun to

01:52:48.099 --> 01:52:53.220
subside, almost like the liquid that's coming
through is not keeping up with the amount that is

01:52:53.220 --> 01:52:54.969
pouring into the hallway behind you.

01:52:54.969 --> 01:52:56.456
LAURA: That's awesome.

01:52:56.456 --> 01:52:58.148
ASHLEY: Good news, guys! We're not going to
drown.

01:52:58.148 --> 01:53:00.516
MATT: Laura, make another strength check.

01:53:00.516 --> 01:53:06.100
LAURA: Okay. This is the best. Oh, four.

01:53:06.100 --> 01:53:14.237
MATT: Okay. You just can't move it. At this point,
the Heat Metal has burned your arms enough to the

01:53:14.237 --> 01:53:17.303
point where you're finding a hard time managing to
keep your muscles together to move it.

01:53:17.303 --> 01:53:19.205
LAURA: It's made of metal, guys.

01:53:19.205 --> 01:53:26.072
MATT: The doorway that's right there, about
waist-high to you, has completely dissolved on the

01:53:26.072 --> 01:53:27.039
bottom.

01:53:27.039 --> 01:53:28.196
SAM: Oh, so we can swim through?

01:53:28.196 --> 01:53:29.156
MATT: If you want to try, yeah.

01:53:29.156 --> 01:53:31.437
SAM: I'm going to do that. I'm going to take a
snorkel.

01:53:31.437 --> 01:53:37.352
MATT: Okay. In doing so, Scanlan, you take eight
points of acid damage, reduced to four because of

01:53:37.352 --> 01:53:44.609
your resistance. You go through and pop out on the
other side in the hallway. It's a stone hallway,

01:53:44.609 --> 01:53:50.988
and the acid is currently dissolving the ground
below, and it's sinking into the ground, China

01:53:50.988 --> 01:53:52.267
Syndrome-style.

01:53:52.267 --> 01:53:53.749
SAM: Are there any buttons, knobs, levers?

01:53:53.749 --> 01:53:58.944
MATT: Looking up, you do see immediately to your
right in the hallway, there is a stone square with

01:53:58.944 --> 01:54:00.176
a push plate.

01:54:00.176 --> 01:54:01.416
LIAM: Motherfucker.

01:54:01.416 --> 01:54:02.628
LAURA: That's what he pushed. Push it!

01:54:02.628 --> 01:54:05.841
SAM: Did I see Vax push that?

01:54:05.841 --> 01:54:10.242
MATT: You saw Vax appear behind them and push
something in that direction.

01:54:10.242 --> 01:54:11.688
SAM: Okay, so I will push that.

01:54:11.688 --> 01:54:18.725
MATT: Okay, you push it. As it clicks inward, you
hear the grinding of gears and stone, and all of a

01:54:18.725 --> 01:54:23.226
sudden the tube that you're holding shudders for a
second. The fluid begins to stop spewing forth.

01:54:23.226 --> 01:54:28.307
The rest of it begins to glide out, eventually
coming to a stop as the acid stops pouring into

01:54:28.307 --> 01:54:35.485
the room. The door that you swam under lifts up.

01:54:35.485 --> 01:54:49.606
SAM: Guess I could have done that before. Sorry. I
wanted to wait until they were gone. That's what

01:54:49.606 --> 01:54:52.427
it was. I was waiting until they were gone.

01:54:52.427 --> 01:55:00.222
MATT: At this point in time, you see where the
opals were on the sides, the portions that keep

01:55:00.222 --> 01:55:05.447
them housed? Slowly move into the wall, leaving
these holes behind them, and the one in the ground

01:55:05.447 --> 01:55:11.444
depresses and disappears. As it does, the acid
that's in the room begins to slowly drain out.

01:55:11.444 --> 01:55:14.028
TRAVIS: Yes.

01:55:14.028 --> 01:55:16.998
MARISHA: Scanlan, what do you see on the other
side of where you are?

01:55:16.998 --> 01:55:25.215
SAM: I see stone, acid, a very handsome gnome-- oh
wait, that's me. And a big button that I just

01:55:25.215 --> 01:55:26.163
pressed.

01:55:26.163 --> 01:55:27.605
TALIESIN: We can see you now, can't we?

01:55:27.605 --> 01:55:29.396
SAM: Oh, hi. See you guys, you look green.

01:55:29.396 --> 01:55:31.804
LAURA: Unless it's still blocking the way because
the door won't open, so we have to go up and over

01:55:31.804 --> 01:55:33.826
the fucking door. So that's what we have to do.

01:55:33.826 --> 01:55:35.636
TRAVIS: Up and over the wall?

01:55:35.636 --> 01:55:38.975
LAURA: The glass door that is partially destroyed
that won't lower.

01:55:38.975 --> 01:55:40.494
MARISHA: We can't open the door.

01:55:40.494 --> 01:55:43.434
SAM: None, no more buttons or levers out there?
Nothing else?

01:55:43.434 --> 01:55:46.741
MATT: Not currently. You guys smashed everything
that was in the vicinity.

01:55:46.741 --> 01:55:51.390
LAURA: We jammed the door. It won't open. So.
There's a tunnel; we can go up and over.

01:55:51.390 --> 01:55:52.774
SAM: All right, do that.

01:55:52.774 --> 01:55:54.513
TALIESIN: We have a rope.

01:55:54.513 --> 01:55:56.022
MARISHA: Throw a rope over to get over.

01:55:56.022 --> 01:55:59.568
MATT: You wait a few moments for the level to
descend a little bit to the point where you can

01:55:59.568 --> 01:56:03.750
stand comfortably without taking any acid damage.
As it drains over, there is that portion of

01:56:03.750 --> 01:56:08.042
ceiling now where it's pockmarked and destroyed,
close to where the glass wall hits the ceiling--

01:56:08.042 --> 01:56:14.083
LAURA: I use the earring and I go, Vax! Vax,
please! That acid is filling the room! We're all

01:56:14.083 --> 01:56:16.635
dying. I don't know what to do.

01:56:16.635 --> 01:56:24.314
MATT: As you're walking alongside the Briarwoods
into a new chamber, you hear the words hit your

01:56:24.314 --> 01:56:31.588
ear and you can feel the back of your throat
choking up as a part of you is urging you to run

01:56:31.588 --> 01:56:37.216
back. And as you stop instinctively in your step,
the rest of the group walks ahead about ten feet

01:56:37.216 --> 01:56:43.956
before Sylas looks over his shoulder and says,
"Keep up, please. There's work to be done." At

01:56:43.956 --> 01:56:47.431
which point, you feel yourself just continue
stepping forward and catching up to him, because

01:56:47.431 --> 01:56:49.841
you wouldn't want to make Sylas angry.

01:56:49.841 --> 01:56:52.044
TRAVIS: Purple Man.

01:56:52.044 --> 01:56:54.826
MARISHA: Yeah, I was just going to say. Fucking
fuck you, David Tennant.

01:56:54.826 --> 01:56:57.150
(laughter)

01:56:57.150 --> 01:56:59.463
TRAVIS: We've got to get out of this room.

01:56:59.463 --> 01:57:01.556
LAURA: Yeah. Up and over, let's go.

01:57:01.556 --> 01:57:04.201
MATT: All right. How are you guys getting over,
through?

01:57:04.201 --> 01:57:05.678
TALIESIN and MARISHA: Rope.

01:57:05.678 --> 01:57:07.742
LAURA: I have the robe of infinite rope-ness.

01:57:07.742 --> 01:57:13.841
MATT: Okay, so you take a few times. You want to
just throw the rope over? You could, however you

01:57:13.841 --> 01:57:16.291
want to get the rope up and over the area, it
takes a few tries but you get it

01:57:16.291 --> 01:57:17.802
on the other side.

01:57:17.802 --> 01:57:19.008
LAURA: I'm flying.

01:57:19.008 --> 01:57:24.083
MATT: Oh yeah, you're flying, you just drop it
over. It's fine. We'll say for the sake of

01:57:24.083 --> 01:57:27.798
brevity, a few minutes pass. You guys manage to
get each one of you over, Trinket being the

01:57:27.798 --> 01:57:29.088
hardest point.

01:57:29.088 --> 01:57:31.672
LAURA: I tie him and then Grog lifts him like a
pulley.

01:57:31.672 --> 01:57:34.611
TALIESIN: Very uncomfortable for everyone
involved.

01:57:34.611 --> 01:57:38.732
MATT: Which, when Trinket reaches the top, it's
like trying to fit an oblong

01:57:38.732 --> 01:57:40.057
object through a hole.

01:57:40.057 --> 01:57:44.935
LAURA: I'm flying so I get underneath him and try
and wedge him, help him get into the hole.

01:57:44.935 --> 01:57:47.926
MATT: We'll say it takes an additional ten
minutes, but you manage

01:57:47.926 --> 01:57:49.353
to finally get Trinket through.

01:57:49.353 --> 01:57:51.765
LIAM: Oh, I have a rumbly in my tumbly.

01:57:51.765 --> 01:57:59.913
MATT: That was straight-up Winnie the Pooh. I'm
really happy about that. On the other side of the

01:57:59.976 --> 01:58:06.687
now pretty much ruined acid distillery, the
residuum factory that was constructed here by the

01:58:06.687 --> 01:58:12.074
Briarwoods, you can see in the tunnel before you
that most of the stone before you has dissolved,

01:58:12.074 --> 01:58:19.142
and there's certain levels of eroded stonework
that descends about 30 feet before rockily

01:58:19.142 --> 01:58:27.066
climbing back up to the original height it was. It
can be traversed, climbed with mild difficulty,

01:58:27.066 --> 01:58:34.579
but you gather yourselves to continue pushing
forward and to both complete this journey and to

01:58:34.579 --> 01:58:39.535
retrieve your ally who is now currently under the
gaze of your enemy.

01:58:39.535 --> 01:58:44.371
And with that, we're going to take a quick
bathroom break. Quick break.

01:58:44.371 --> 01:58:46.037
Want to get back into this.

01:58:46.037 --> 01:58:48.818
TRAVIS: We'll be right back, Ashley.

01:58:48.818 --> 01:58:50.968
MATT: See you guys in a second.

01:58:50.968 --> 02:07:17.957
[break]

02:07:18.021 --> 02:07:23.975
MATT: And welcome back, everyone. So. As you all
take a moment to regather yourselves after this

02:07:23.975 --> 02:07:29.528
circumstance, you climb your way through this
acid-scarred portion of the hallway ahead of you,

02:07:29.528 --> 02:07:34.949
this like small tunnel up to the other side. As
you're on your way there, Percy, you notice a

02:07:34.949 --> 02:07:42.945
flash of purple and black energy course up the
front of your Pepperbox. You glance down at the

02:07:42.945 --> 02:07:47.945
six o'clock, previously empty barrel, and a new
name now is emblazoned across it. It says,

02:07:47.945 --> 02:07:49.363
"Cassandra de Rolo."

02:07:49.363 --> 02:07:50.464
ALL: Oh!

02:07:50.464 --> 02:07:52.507
TRAVIS: Oh. My. God.

02:07:52.507 --> 02:07:59.290
MARISHA: Wait, that was on that empty barrel?

02:07:59.290 --> 02:08:01.939
ASHLEY: What?

02:08:01.939 --> 02:08:05.362
LAURA: Oh my god. I thought--

02:08:05.362 --> 02:08:07.963
MARISHA: He didn't know who it was for.

02:08:07.963 --> 02:08:09.257
LAURA: Oh my god.

02:08:09.257 --> 02:08:13.833
SAM: Wow.

02:08:13.833 --> 02:08:15.770
TRAVIS: Does any of us see this besides him?

02:08:15.770 --> 02:08:19.463
MATT: You guys all come up to the top, you look
down and you see Percy still down, looking at his

02:08:19.463 --> 02:08:24.086
gun in a wide-eyed, spacey expression on his
face.

02:08:24.086 --> 02:08:25.601
LAURA: Percival?

02:08:25.601 --> 02:08:26.728
TRAVIS: You all right?

02:08:26.728 --> 02:08:29.763
TALIESIN: No. No, I'm not.

02:08:29.763 --> 02:08:41.100
SAM: Is your bangy thing okay? Is it your sister?

02:08:41.100 --> 02:08:43.874
TALIESIN: We'll see what this means.

02:08:43.874 --> 02:08:45.981
MARISHA: Oh, Percy.

02:08:45.981 --> 02:08:49.612
TALIESIN: Let's go take care of this.

02:08:49.612 --> 02:08:54.291
TRAVIS: Yeah. Let's. But you always have a
choice.

02:08:54.291 --> 02:08:56.530
TALIESIN: We'll see.

02:08:56.530 --> 02:09:02.514
MATT: You climb up and out, you guys make your way
down this tunnel, no more than 60 feet from where

02:09:02.514 --> 02:09:12.619
you are, before the chamber opens up before you
into what is a large underground cavern. Mostly

02:09:12.619 --> 02:09:15.565
cleared out, it looks like portions of it are, you
know, both the tunnel and this area--

02:09:15.565 --> 02:09:17.032
LAURA: Can we stealth?

02:09:17.032 --> 02:09:18.144
MATT: You can if you'd like.

02:09:18.144 --> 02:09:22.023
LAURA: I think we should, because as far as they
know, we're dead now. They don't know we got out

02:09:22.023 --> 02:09:22.848
of there.

02:09:22.848 --> 02:09:23.941
MARISHA: It's true.

02:09:23.941 --> 02:09:25.668
MATT: Okay. So everyone go ahead and roll
stealth.

02:09:25.668 --> 02:09:29.314
MARISHA: Oh my god.

02:09:29.314 --> 02:09:32.840
LAURA: Yeah, I'm going to cast Pass Without a
Trace on us.

02:09:32.840 --> 02:09:35.229
MARISHA: I still critical failed.

02:09:35.229 --> 02:09:39.241
LAURA: Wait, can't you roll again now that I told
you we were casting--

02:09:39.241 --> 02:09:42.472
MATT: (laughs) Nah. It stays, unfortunately.

02:09:42.554 --> 02:09:44.018
LAURA: Doesn't work that way?

02:09:44.018 --> 02:09:47.405
MATT: All right, so, stealth rolls, plus ten to
everyone's stealth. What was it?

02:09:47.498 --> 02:09:48.301
TRAVIS: 26.

02:09:48.301 --> 02:09:49.363
MATT: 26. Vex?

02:09:49.363 --> 02:09:51.943
ASHLEY: 16.

02:09:51.943 --> 02:09:55.914
LAURA: Nice. 35.

02:09:55.914 --> 02:09:57.743
SAM: 27.

02:09:57.743 --> 02:09:59.913
TALIESIN: 24.

02:09:59.913 --> 02:10:05.843
MATT: Okay. As a median, the group does really
well, so that helps overtake for your misstep.

02:10:05.928 --> 02:10:09.134
MARISHA: God, it's cold in here! Jesus.

02:10:09.134 --> 02:10:14.829
MATT: Looking around, you can see the boards and
pieces of wood and stone that are keeping this

02:10:14.829 --> 02:10:24.105
hallway up, and as you step into this large
chamber, it's dark and mostly freshly carved

02:10:24.158 --> 02:10:28.152
earth. Elements of earth have been taken out, and
you can see to the right and left of you as you

02:10:28.152 --> 02:10:32.826
enter this chamber there are more and more chunks
of that broken stone and large piles of moved

02:10:32.826 --> 02:10:38.975
earth that are in some levels of being left there
or going to be moved out, or eventually were put

02:10:38.975 --> 02:10:42.361
to a point where it was no longer necessary to
have to clear the area.

02:10:42.361 --> 02:10:52.047
You do see, on the sides of you, there are these
iron carts, wheeled carts that have handles on

02:10:52.047 --> 02:10:59.222
them. Some have means of being pulled along
separately. These carts were used, you can gather,

02:10:59.222 --> 02:11:02.585
for moving a lot of the materials back and forth.
It's probably what the ramps in the previous rooms

02:11:02.585 --> 02:11:10.018
were also to collect. You can see there's a
residuum dust coating on a lot of these carts, as

02:11:10.018 --> 02:11:12.102
well as broken pieces of whitestone.

02:11:12.102 --> 02:11:16.534
TRAVIS: The broken pieces of whitestone, are there
any that are the size of two hands?

02:11:16.534 --> 02:11:19.282
MATT: There's a few you could probably grab,
yeah.

02:11:19.282 --> 02:11:22.368
TRAVIS: Can I grab a big, two-handed piece and put
it in the Bag of Holding?

02:11:22.368 --> 02:11:23.380
MATT: Sure.

02:11:23.380 --> 02:11:26.496
LAURA: Can I take some of it and rub it on some of
my arrows?

02:11:26.496 --> 02:11:37.358
MATT: Okay. Sure. You rub it on. Most of it falls
off, as it's metallic arrow point to dust, but

02:11:37.358 --> 02:11:43.473
some of it does manage to stay on for the time
being. Your holy oil is still active, those that

02:11:43.473 --> 02:11:48.098
you dipped your arrows in. However, as you look
past the darkness, you can see in the center of

02:11:48.098 --> 02:11:59.867
this room a monolithic structure not unlike a
large pyramid-type platformed element, and

02:11:59.867 --> 02:12:05.616
immediately upon looking at it, you can see this
has to be the ziggurat that everyone's been

02:12:05.616 --> 02:12:08.471
talking about in Whitestone.

02:12:08.471 --> 02:12:15.253
You can see that the base of it is white, and is
very much the same texture and color as all of the

02:12:15.253 --> 02:12:19.056
whitestone you've seen used in the construction
and all of the mining materials here within the

02:12:19.056 --> 02:12:24.736
city, but from what little light you have in the
room-- and there is a little bit of ambient light

02:12:24.736 --> 02:12:29.366
from torches set at different points, and those
who can see decently at a distance, and there is

02:12:29.366 --> 02:12:36.729
an ominous glow to the structure itself-- it
gradually turns to a greenish color. Hard to see

02:12:36.729 --> 02:12:41.617
exactly why this transition is, but it goes from
white to a green towards the top, and it levels

02:12:41.617 --> 02:12:47.311
off. You can see what looks to be a small separate
structure at the very top. There are long

02:12:47.311 --> 02:12:52.907
stairways that are visible on the two sides you
can see before you: long stairways.

02:12:52.907 --> 02:12:55.079
Everyone make a perception check.

02:12:55.079 --> 02:12:58.744
LAURA: I'm scared of all of my dice right now.

02:12:58.744 --> 02:13:00.898
MARISHA: Yeah, mine are failing me.

02:13:00.898 --> 02:13:01.954
SAM: One.

02:13:01.954 --> 02:13:02.969
MARISHA: Fucking shit.

02:13:02.969 --> 02:13:05.113
LAURA: 18.

02:13:05.113 --> 02:13:06.358
ASHLEY: 14.

02:13:06.358 --> 02:13:07.387
TRAVIS: Ten.

02:13:07.387 --> 02:13:08.915
TALIESIN: 24.

02:13:08.915 --> 02:13:09.997
MARISHA: 16.

02:13:09.997 --> 02:13:17.532
MATT: Okay. Vex and Percy: as you begin to step
out along the wall, and as you guys are moving

02:13:17.532 --> 02:13:22.584
towards the ziggurat, you can see through the
darkness, there is a bit of low light along the

02:13:22.584 --> 02:13:29.275
edge of the pyramid, and you can see, halfway up
the staircase, four individuals stepping up the

02:13:29.275 --> 02:13:30.801
stairs at a distance.

02:13:30.801 --> 02:13:35.144
SAM: Is this Egyptian pyramid-sized big?

02:13:35.144 --> 02:13:38.522
MATT: It's more Aztec. It's not quite gargantuan.

02:13:38.522 --> 02:13:41.251
SAM: There's 200 stairs?

02:13:41.251 --> 02:13:46.906
MATT: Approximately. I'd say the whole structure
from bottom to high is maybe 200 feet tall. It's

02:13:46.906 --> 02:13:48.577
not extremely large.

02:13:48.577 --> 02:13:50.563
TALIESIN: What's the roof look like above it?

02:13:50.563 --> 02:13:54.883
MATT: It's hard to see at this distance,
especially with the very little light here. You

02:13:54.883 --> 02:13:58.182
can tell just enough, though, that there is some
sort of roof, but you can't make any details out

02:13:58.182 --> 02:13:59.479
from this distance.

02:13:59.479 --> 02:14:03.396
MARISHA: Do I have any geographical idea of where
we are in the city? Is this located

02:14:03.396 --> 02:14:04.799
under the Sun Tree?

02:14:04.799 --> 02:14:07.350
MATT: This would be pretty close to where the Sun
Tree is located, yeah.

02:14:07.350 --> 02:14:13.266
SAM: Before we go stomping in there, should we
take a short rest and heal up? Is anyone besides

02:14:13.266 --> 02:14:15.215
me and Pike damaged at all?

02:14:15.215 --> 02:14:16.823
LAURA: I'm damaged a little.

02:14:16.823 --> 02:14:18.024
MARISHA: I'm damaged, but--

02:14:18.024 --> 02:14:20.666
LAURA: I don't know how long I want to wait when
Vax is--

02:14:20.666 --> 02:14:22.981
SAM: We don't want to start traipsing up. They'll
see us coming.

02:14:22.981 --> 02:14:25.009
TRAVIS: Is there cover? Can they see us if we can
see them?

02:14:25.009 --> 02:14:31.673
MATT: Where you're currently standing, there's
very little to no light. If you're careful, you

02:14:31.673 --> 02:14:34.313
could possibly slip by their detection.

02:14:34.379 --> 02:14:37.574
SAM: Or we could wait until they get up there and
then go.

02:14:37.678 --> 02:14:39.557
TALIESIN: Except what happens when they get up
there?

02:14:39.557 --> 02:14:44.682
LIAM: Quick question: while I'm with my new
friends, in any moments that they're not telling

02:14:44.682 --> 02:14:48.423
me to go somewhere or walk somewhere, can I just
look at the symbol on my hand?

02:14:48.423 --> 02:14:50.021
MATT: Yeah.

02:14:50.021 --> 02:14:54.580
LIAM: That's it. Just stare at it whenever I can,
when they're not paying attention.

02:14:54.580 --> 02:15:01.204
MATT: Okay. You glance at it. It doesn't seem to
have any particular glow or connection. Especially

02:15:01.204 --> 02:15:06.844
since Pike made her arrival, it seems to be the
energy of connection that was briefly housed in

02:15:06.844 --> 02:15:10.626
that symbol by her has transitioned to her form
here.

02:15:10.626 --> 02:15:15.208
TRAVIS: Will anybody gain something back from a
short rest that we really need, or do we need to

02:15:15.208 --> 02:15:16.412
go after them?

02:15:16.412 --> 02:15:19.037
MARISHA: I'm afraid they're marching him to his
death.

02:15:19.037 --> 02:15:20.984
LAURA: To sacrifice him.

02:15:20.984 --> 02:15:22.319
TRAVIS: What about you?

02:15:22.319 --> 02:15:26.603
SAM: I'd gain a few hit points, but it's nothing
bad. I can take a potion.

02:15:26.690 --> 02:15:29.731
MARISHA: We'll have to heal in battle, if we need
to.

02:15:29.731 --> 02:15:33.614
ASHLEY: I can do a healing spell, you know.

02:15:33.614 --> 02:15:36.336
SAM: Thanks, Sarah Palin.

02:15:36.336 --> 02:15:39.866
MATT: If you'd like to.

02:15:39.866 --> 02:15:45.583
ASHLEY: Where's everybody at?

02:15:45.583 --> 02:15:48.211
LAURA: That Vasselheim accent is rubbing off on
you, Pike.

02:15:48.211 --> 02:15:51.577
MATT: Who's looking hurt?

02:15:51.577 --> 02:15:54.478
ASHLEY: Are you guys all pretty low?

02:15:54.545 --> 02:15:55.794
TALIESIN: I'm all right.

02:15:55.794 --> 02:15:57.197
SAM: Not really.

02:15:57.197 --> 02:15:59.164
LAURA: I think save your spells, Pike.

02:15:59.164 --> 02:16:04.120
MARISHA: What's the plan?

02:16:04.120 --> 02:16:05.683
TRAVIS: Let's go.

02:16:05.683 --> 02:16:10.075
LAURA: I don't know. Stealth as much as we can and
then take them out? I don't know.

02:16:10.075 --> 02:16:13.716
TRAVIS: We're at the bottom of this pyramid.
They're walking up to the top.

02:16:13.716 --> 02:16:16.561
MATT: At this time, they're close to the top.

02:16:16.561 --> 02:16:18.219
TALIESIN: Let's start making our way.

02:16:18.219 --> 02:16:21.173
MATT: It's just stairs. Pretty steep stairs, but
stairs nonetheless.

02:16:21.173 --> 02:16:24.635
TALIESIN: We're going to have to Ghostbusters
this.

02:16:24.635 --> 02:16:27.303
LAURA: How high up can I fly? Is it all dark up?

02:16:27.303 --> 02:16:31.913
MATT: It is. There's a very little bit of light
that's part of the ziggurat itself.

02:16:31.913 --> 02:16:33.415
LAURA: I keep raising up.

02:16:33.415 --> 02:16:34.892
TRAVIS: Four sides to the pyramid?

02:16:34.892 --> 02:16:36.456
MATT: Four sides. You can only see two.

02:16:36.456 --> 02:16:39.135
LAURA: I want to keep raising up so I can get a
better view of what's happening.

02:16:39.135 --> 02:16:47.453
MARISHA: I tell Pike real quick, Pike, we are
right under the Sun Tree, which was dedicated to

02:16:47.453 --> 02:16:54.992
the god Pelor. This tree might end up being our
best friend in this fight. Keep that in mind going

02:16:54.992 --> 02:16:55.852
forward.

02:16:55.852 --> 02:16:58.045
LAURA: Are Sarenrae and Pelor good buddies?

02:16:58.045 --> 02:16:59.858
MARISHA: Yeah, are they on good terms?

02:16:59.858 --> 02:17:01.242
ASHLEY: Well, let's hope so.

02:17:01.242 --> 02:17:03.024
(laughter)

02:17:03.024 --> 02:17:04.290
LAURA: Would you know?

02:17:04.290 --> 02:17:11.213
MATT: You would know that Sarenrae and Pelor are
adjacent deities in this realm. They have many

02:17:11.213 --> 02:17:23.055
overlapping interests and both strive to light, to
healing-- many spheres of overlap in those

02:17:23.055 --> 02:17:24.636
regards, so yes.

02:17:24.636 --> 02:17:29.167
ASHLEY: Now that I'm thinking about it, I think
they are pretty good friends.

02:17:29.237 --> 02:17:32.441
SAM: How far away are the four figures from us
right now?

02:17:32.441 --> 02:17:40.007
MATT: Oh, man. They're probably a good 500 to 600
feet from you.

02:17:40.007 --> 02:17:41.512
MARISHA: Should we flank and go?

02:17:41.512 --> 02:17:42.979
SAM: Do you want to just hit them hard?

02:17:42.979 --> 02:17:44.641
LAURA: Or should we get on each side?

02:17:44.641 --> 02:17:46.142
MARISHA: How many feet? 50 to 60 feet?

02:17:46.142 --> 02:17:47.225
SAM: 600.

02:17:47.225 --> 02:17:50.168
MATT: They're at the top of the ziggurat now.
Actually, at this time, they're just now cresting

02:17:50.168 --> 02:17:51.745
over and vanishing over the lip.

02:17:51.745 --> 02:17:55.852
TRAVIS: From the base of the pyramid, what would
you say the base circumference of this ziggurat

02:17:55.852 --> 02:17:58.559
is? Is it half a mile around?

02:17:58.559 --> 02:18:02.152
MATT: No, it's smaller than that. I'd say it's
about--

02:18:02.152 --> 02:18:06.648
LAURA: 200 feet square? One on each side?

02:18:06.648 --> 02:18:08.659
TRAVIS: Yeah, should we come up on different
sides?

02:18:08.659 --> 02:18:10.770
LAURA: Percy, what do you think?

02:18:10.770 --> 02:18:13.407
MARISHA and TALIESIN: Flank them.

02:18:13.407 --> 02:18:16.012
SAM: They're going to be inside, though, before we
get halfway up.

02:18:16.012 --> 02:18:17.565
TALIESIN: There's no inside. It's just on top.

02:18:17.565 --> 02:18:19.255
TRAVIS: We don't know what's up there.

02:18:19.255 --> 02:18:20.904
LAURA: Can I see? I raised up.

02:18:20.904 --> 02:18:22.115
MATT: You raised up and you look--

02:18:22.115 --> 02:18:24.206
SAM: It's for grain storage.

02:18:24.206 --> 02:18:27.564
(laughter)

02:18:27.564 --> 02:18:32.141
MATT: What little source of light you can see,
where the stairs stop, there's a level platform,

02:18:32.141 --> 02:18:37.719
there's some pillars, and there appears to be a
secondary structure, a deep green, almost dark

02:18:37.719 --> 02:18:43.218
jade-type structure that is built. A square
structure right there at the very top.

02:18:43.218 --> 02:18:45.508
MARISHA: Probably out of the same glass bullshit.

02:18:45.508 --> 02:18:48.101
LAURA: Vax will hear me if I whisper down to
everybody.

02:18:48.101 --> 02:18:49.641
TRAVIS: Oh, fuck. That's right.

02:18:49.641 --> 02:18:52.421
MARISHA: See if he can stall. Tell him to stall.

02:18:52.421 --> 02:18:55.490
LAURA: (whispering) Vax. Vax!

02:18:55.490 --> 02:19:03.712
MATT: You can still respond, if you wish. You
still have your mind about you; you just consider

02:19:03.712 --> 02:19:07.182
the Briarwoods right now your closest allies, and
they have to be protected.

02:19:07.182 --> 02:19:09.811
LIAM: Where are you?

02:19:09.811 --> 02:19:14.639
SAM: No. Stop it.

02:19:14.639 --> 02:19:23.807
LAURA: (whispering) I don't know where we are.
Acid everywhere. Vax, please. Isn't there anything

02:19:23.807 --> 02:19:26.284
you can do?

02:19:26.284 --> 02:19:29.267
LIAM: We should all be together. You should join
me here.

02:19:29.267 --> 02:19:32.387
LAURA: (whispering) I would love to, but I don't
know where you are.

02:19:32.387 --> 02:19:43.265
LIAM: I'm on the top of a thing. I can see very
far. Everybody is very attractive up here. I think

02:19:43.265 --> 02:19:48.133
something nice is about to happen. I'm afraid to
ask questions, though; I don't want to seem--

02:19:48.133 --> 02:19:50.605
MATT: "Who are you talking to, lovely boy?"

02:19:50.605 --> 02:19:52.095
LAURA: (whispering) Please, Vax. Please.

02:19:52.095 --> 02:19:54.104
LIAM: To Sarenrae.

02:19:54.104 --> 02:19:59.342
MATT: Make a wisdom check.

02:19:59.342 --> 02:20:06.689
LIAM: With no advantage? I'm still a half-elf.

02:20:06.689 --> 02:20:07.963
MATT: I know.

02:20:07.963 --> 02:20:12.268
LAURA: Isn't he supposed to not be able to get
charmed?

02:20:12.268 --> 02:20:13.759
LIAM: 13. No, I have advantage.

02:20:13.759 --> 02:20:15.044
TALIESIN: Feast.

02:20:15.044 --> 02:20:17.459
MATT: This isn't a saving throw.

02:20:17.459 --> 02:20:19.015
LIAM: Advantage for half-elf, advantage for
feast.

02:20:19.015 --> 02:20:20.465
MATT: What did you roll?

02:20:20.465 --> 02:20:21.403
LIAM: Total of 13.

02:20:21.403 --> 02:20:27.195
MATT: 13? Okay. You continue with the deception.
You pushed through enough to guard the answer, as

02:20:27.195 --> 02:20:34.803
opposed to spilling the truth to your ally. She
gives a, "That's not very welcome here. I would

02:20:34.803 --> 02:20:36.483
"not recommend that. Put it away."

02:20:36.483 --> 02:20:37.568
LIAM: What is that?

02:20:37.568 --> 02:20:39.315
MATT: "Put it away. That's not welcome here."

02:20:39.315 --> 02:20:43.395
LIAM: Yes. You're still very pretty.

02:20:43.395 --> 02:20:47.170
MATT: "I'm taken, my darling."

02:20:47.170 --> 02:20:49.106
LAURA: I'm stalling so that everyone can walk
around.

02:20:49.189 --> 02:20:50.246
LIAM: Me too.

02:20:50.246 --> 02:20:51.941
TALIESIN: I'm starting to make my way up.

02:20:52.009 --> 02:20:54.143
MARISHA: We're flanking on the far side.

02:20:54.143 --> 02:20:56.487
ASHLEY: Can I go up to Vax and--

02:20:56.487 --> 02:20:57.760
LAURA: Oh, he's not here!

02:20:57.760 --> 02:21:02.467
MATT: Vax isn't with you guys. Vax is with the
Briarwoods at the top of the ziggurat.

02:21:02.467 --> 02:21:03.652
LIAM: Earring talk.

02:21:03.652 --> 02:21:08.622
ASHLEY: Shit. Okay, sorry. That must have been
when I got disconnected. I know

02:21:08.622 --> 02:21:09.893
what's going on now.

02:21:09.893 --> 02:21:13.201
MATT: So while they're having this discussion, you
guys begin to ascend the steps as a group?

02:21:13.201 --> 02:21:16.827
TRAVIS: There are four sides. Who wants to come on
my side?

02:21:16.827 --> 02:21:18.125
SAM: Me and Pike.

02:21:18.125 --> 02:21:19.265
TRAVIS: Okay.

02:21:19.265 --> 02:21:20.446
MARISHA: I'll go with Grog.

02:21:20.446 --> 02:21:21.555
LAURA: Wait.

02:21:21.555 --> 02:21:23.167
TALIESIN: And you can join me.

02:21:23.167 --> 02:21:24.260
LAURA: I'm flying up.

02:21:24.260 --> 02:21:26.272
TALIESIN: So I'm just walking up the center.

02:21:26.272 --> 02:21:27.452
LAURA: Trinket's going--

02:21:27.452 --> 02:21:28.438
TALIESIN: With me.

02:21:28.438 --> 02:21:29.240
LAURA: Sure.

02:21:29.240 --> 02:21:30.225
TALIESIN: Trinket's with me.

02:21:30.225 --> 02:21:35.169
MARISHA: Guys, thought for a second: what if Percy
goes as a distraction? Percy goes first.

02:21:35.169 --> 02:21:36.527
SAM: We all look like Percy.

02:21:36.527 --> 02:21:42.295
MARISHA: But they might be able to see through
that. Use Percy as bait while

02:21:42.295 --> 02:21:43.539
the rest of us go up.

02:21:43.539 --> 02:21:46.426
LAURA: Vax looks like Percy right now! They know
we're up to something.

02:21:46.426 --> 02:21:48.571
MARISHA: That's why I said send in the real
Percy.

02:21:48.571 --> 02:21:49.690
LAURA: Send in the real Percy?

02:21:49.690 --> 02:21:52.829
MATT: So, how many groups are you breaking into?

02:21:52.829 --> 02:21:54.308
TALIESIN and TRAVIS: Three.

02:21:54.308 --> 02:21:59.343
MATT: Three groups. Okay. Gnomes in one, Percy and
Trinket in one, Grog and who else?

02:21:59.343 --> 02:22:00.431
TRAVIS: Keyleth.

02:22:00.431 --> 02:22:02.410
MATT: Keyleth, and you're floating above
somewhere.

02:22:02.410 --> 02:22:04.138
LAURA: I'm floating above, keeping an eye.

02:22:04.138 --> 02:22:05.137
MATT: Okay.

02:22:05.137 --> 02:22:07.142
LAURA: (laughing) Oh no, this is so stupid.

02:22:07.142 --> 02:22:08.542
MARISHA: My heart is pounding.

02:22:08.542 --> 02:22:15.198
MATT: As you all separate, the closest stairway to
you, you would probably get there sooner. Who's

02:22:15.198 --> 02:22:16.259
taking that stairway?

02:22:16.259 --> 02:22:19.017
SAM: The gnomes. We're slow.

02:22:19.017 --> 02:22:24.472
LAURA: And I'm sneaking into the dark as much as I
can, but I want to raise up and be where I can be

02:22:24.472 --> 02:22:26.054
above them and shoot down.

02:22:26.054 --> 02:22:27.758
MATT: All right, and you three are going on this
side?

02:22:27.758 --> 02:22:28.722
TRAVIS: Sure.

02:22:28.722 --> 02:22:30.480
MATT: Okay, we'll say you're on this side.

02:22:30.480 --> 02:22:35.418
SAM: Maybe we should split the party further.

02:22:35.418 --> 02:22:37.681
MATT: You could. It's not a bad idea.

02:22:37.681 --> 02:22:40.399
LAURA: This is so brilliant.

02:22:40.399 --> 02:22:41.816
MARISHA: We've got this.

02:22:41.816 --> 02:22:45.916
MATT: All right.

02:22:45.916 --> 02:22:47.370
LAURA: Oh god.

02:22:47.370 --> 02:22:53.479
MATT: As you begin to ascend the steps, a couple
of things. One, you notice the structure is very

02:22:53.479 --> 02:23:02.415
old at its base. The whitestone itself is cracked
and worn, weathered, and most of it is indeed made

02:23:02.415 --> 02:23:07.226
from the whitestone from the surrounding mountains
of the Alabaster Sierras, mined ages and ages ago.

02:23:07.226 --> 02:23:12.769
As you get further up, you begin to see sections
of it that are newer stone, areas that have been

02:23:12.769 --> 02:23:20.677
renovated and rebuilt and made to complete this
apparently once-sundered structure.

02:23:20.677 --> 02:23:28.426
As you all begin to creep up past the midpoint,
you begin to notice the color change. The

02:23:28.426 --> 02:23:36.509
whitestone begins to fade away as you begin to see
clusters of that same green residuum glass is now

02:23:36.509 --> 02:23:42.940
set across, smooth, almost like the limestone of a
pyramid, like a top layer to it. As you begin to

02:23:42.940 --> 02:23:47.683
get further to the top, eventually the entirety of
the stone and the stairs are coated in this

02:23:47.683 --> 02:23:53.192
material to the point where there's even a little
bit of slickness in certain places from the

02:23:53.192 --> 02:23:59.063
smoothness. It's like chipped obsidian, how it's
flaked away and has those divots in it. There is

02:23:59.063 --> 02:24:01.504
that smoothness, that glass-like texture to it.

02:24:01.504 --> 02:24:08.868
As you begin to get towards the very top of the
stairway, each of you carefully keeping in line,

02:24:08.868 --> 02:24:14.207
talking to each other quietly, you begin to see
the central structure at the top of the platform

02:24:14.207 --> 02:24:22.617
begin to appear. It is a simple, four-walled
structure made purely of this dark jade glass

02:24:22.617 --> 02:24:30.812
material. There's a slight overhang with a few
platforms that seem to hold this, for lack of a

02:24:30.812 --> 02:24:36.485
better term, awning-type platform that hangs over
the entrance to this.

02:24:36.485 --> 02:24:41.914
You guys are about to reach the lip. Is there any
preparation you want to do?

02:24:41.914 --> 02:24:43.997
TRAVIS: (quietly) I would like to rage.

02:24:43.997 --> 02:24:46.638
(laughter)

02:24:46.722 --> 02:24:51.676
MARISHA: Does the building seem-- is it completely
encased?

02:24:51.676 --> 02:24:55.297
MATT: The building is entirely encased in this
material.

02:24:55.297 --> 02:24:57.078
MARISHA: And they're already inside?

02:24:57.078 --> 02:24:59.552
MATT: You haven't gotten to the very top of the
lip yet.

02:24:59.552 --> 02:25:02.029
LAURA: Can I see? I'm raised above, right?

02:25:02.029 --> 02:25:09.939
MATT: You see, as they're having this
conversation, they talk a bit with Vax, speak with

02:25:09.939 --> 02:25:20.075
Cassandra, then they step forward and begin to
open the two doors to the central chamber.

02:25:20.075 --> 02:25:27.902
LIAM: Can I ask a clarification question? The mojo
they have on me: do I think they're my best

02:25:27.986 --> 02:25:33.265
friends in the world, or is it more Kilgrave; I do
whatever they say, but have my own opinion trapped

02:25:33.265 --> 02:25:34.258
away?

02:25:34.258 --> 02:25:37.713
MATT: You have your own opinion, you just trust
them implicitly. They have to be protected.

02:25:37.713 --> 02:25:41.404
LIAM: All right. It's a little of both, it seems
like.

02:25:41.404 --> 02:25:46.914
MATT: Like any close friend who would ask
something of you and say, "please come with me,"

02:25:46.914 --> 02:25:49.198
there is an essence that you're compelled--

02:25:49.198 --> 02:25:50.452
LIAM: I trust them.

02:25:50.452 --> 02:25:51.981
MATT: You trust them, yeah.

02:25:51.981 --> 02:25:55.665
ASHLEY: Am I close to Percy at all? Or did we
already separate?

02:25:55.665 --> 02:25:57.170
MATT: No, you guys have already separated.

02:25:57.170 --> 02:25:58.315
ASHLEY: Dang it.

02:25:58.315 --> 02:26:03.668
MARISHA: We have to stop them before they close
these doors. If they close the doors, it's over.

02:26:03.668 --> 02:26:05.157
SAM: Do we see them closing the doors?

02:26:05.157 --> 02:26:07.957
MATT: They've just opened the doors and are
beginning to enter.

02:26:07.957 --> 02:26:10.099
MARISHA: Percy, go. Get their attention. Percy!

02:26:10.099 --> 02:26:12.756
TALIESIN: I'm heading up.

02:26:12.756 --> 02:26:19.163
LAURA: I'm going to stay hidden as my-- oh, god--
and I'm going to dip the rest of

02:26:19.163 --> 02:26:20.252
my arrows in holy oil.

02:26:20.252 --> 02:26:21.594
MATT: Okay, as you're stepping up.

02:26:21.594 --> 02:26:23.865
SAM: I inspire Pike real quick, just before the
battle.

02:26:23.865 --> 02:26:26.264
MATT: Okay, what do you do to inspire her?

02:26:26.264 --> 02:26:34.195
SAM: I just look at her and I say, roses are red,
violets are blue, we're both gnomes, and you are

02:26:34.195 --> 02:26:35.976
so foxy!

02:26:35.976 --> 02:26:37.837
(laughter)

02:26:37.837 --> 02:26:40.109
SAM: That's it.

02:26:40.109 --> 02:26:41.391
MATT: All right.

02:26:41.391 --> 02:26:44.833
MARISHA: When I look up, can I see the ceiling
now?

02:26:44.833 --> 02:26:53.429
MATT: Looking up, you can see the roof is carved
earth. There is no loose stone; it looks like this

02:26:53.429 --> 02:26:56.609
chamber has been carefully hollowed out over
time.

02:26:56.609 --> 02:27:01.581
MARISHA: Can I see a root system of a really
deep-running tree?

02:27:01.581 --> 02:27:03.541
MATT: Currently? No, you cannot.

02:27:03.541 --> 02:27:04.894
MARISHA: Fuck. Okay.

02:27:04.894 --> 02:27:07.168
MATT: Percy, what are you doing?

02:27:07.168 --> 02:27:10.649
TALIESIN: I'm walking up the steps. I'm putting
the mask on.

02:27:10.649 --> 02:27:17.161
MATT: As you put the mask on and you begin to
ascend, you can feel the nerves tickle your belly

02:27:17.161 --> 02:27:23.383
and you know what you're about to encounter, and
doing so, you feel that heat rise in the back of

02:27:23.383 --> 02:27:29.640
your neck, and as you do, (whoosh) the smoke
begins to billow out from under your collar and

02:27:29.640 --> 02:27:31.204
out of your sleeves.

02:27:31.204 --> 02:27:34.584
TALIESIN: I make my way to the top of the stairs.

02:27:34.584 --> 02:27:40.711
MATT: Trinket coming slowly behind you. They open
the doors and they're beginning to step into the

02:27:40.711 --> 02:27:41.840
chamber.

02:27:41.840 --> 02:27:43.536
TALIESIN: Sylas!

02:27:43.536 --> 02:27:47.265
MATT: They stop. Both Lord and Lady Briarwood look
over their shoulder.

02:27:47.265 --> 02:27:49.633
TALIESIN: A moment of your time.

02:27:49.633 --> 02:27:59.111
MATT: They look at each other, (sighs) close the
chamber door. Sylas reaches out and grabs

02:27:59.111 --> 02:28:06.524
something or pushes something that's out of sight,
and then they both turn and begin to step forward

02:28:06.524 --> 02:28:12.609
a little bit, with Vax and Cassandra flanking
them, stopping right outside of the doors.

02:28:12.609 --> 02:28:21.979
MARISHA: Okay, as he's distracting them, get in
position? Try and stealth behind these

02:28:22.056 --> 02:28:23.181
buildings?

02:28:23.181 --> 02:28:27.158
MATT: So you guys are on technically that side and
that side of the pyramid right now.

02:28:27.158 --> 02:28:32.912
MARISHA: Yeah. It looks like there's pillars and
shit?

02:28:32.912 --> 02:28:37.544
MATT: Yeah, the pillars are evenly spread around
the entire chamber.

02:28:37.544 --> 02:28:39.918
MARISHA: Yeah, let's come in from the back. I
don't know what the gnomes are doing.

02:28:39.918 --> 02:28:45.018
MATT: You guys would have to have come around the
corner, and this is the walkway here, so you'd be

02:28:45.018 --> 02:28:46.387
coming in from this side.

02:28:46.387 --> 02:28:49.920
SAM: Stay out of sight, but get as close as we
can.

02:28:49.987 --> 02:28:51.969
LAURA: I float closer in the darkness.

02:28:51.969 --> 02:28:54.022
MATT: Okay, over here?

02:28:54.022 --> 02:28:55.222
LAURA: Up. Up.

02:28:55.222 --> 02:28:59.813
MATT: Up, up? My platforms seem to have gone
missing for the preparation of this game, but

02:28:59.813 --> 02:29:03.857
we'll say for the time being, you are up here.

02:29:03.857 --> 02:29:17.049
TALIESIN: My hands are on a device which I have
made that's on my hip that I'm ready to begin

02:29:17.049 --> 02:29:18.911
using at a moment's notice.

02:29:18.911 --> 02:29:20.574
SAM: It's a French tickler.

02:29:20.574 --> 02:29:25.348
TALIESIN: It's the most ticklish French tickler
you've ever seen, baby.

02:29:25.348 --> 02:29:29.521
LAURA: I don't have something planned. I'm just
going to go.

02:29:29.521 --> 02:29:34.707
SAM: What's this? What's going on?

02:29:34.707 --> 02:29:38.430
TALIESIN: We have debts to settle, Sylas.

02:29:38.430 --> 02:29:51.908
MATT: "And apparently, you and your friends are
obnoxious enough to not stay dead."

02:29:51.908 --> 02:29:56.896
TALIESIN: They were kind enough to make sure that
I made my way here to face you.

02:29:56.896 --> 02:30:06.713
MATT: (chuckles) "Well, perhaps this evening won't
be so boring after all, will it?" And Sylas looks

02:30:06.713 --> 02:30:08.594
over to Delilah.

02:30:08.594 --> 02:30:11.675
Delilah gives him a look, too, and says, "Very
well."

02:30:11.743 --> 02:30:26.692
TALIESIN: The darkness demands your soul, Sylas.
I'm going to cast Hex on Lady Briarwood and pull

02:30:26.692 --> 02:30:31.192
my smoke bomb at the exact same second and throw
it at them.

02:30:31.192 --> 02:30:40.200
MATT: Okay. So, as you release your hand and the
smoke builds up at your fingertips and then shoots

02:30:40.200 --> 02:30:47.695
off and clings itself to her form, she looks down
with a bit of a grin, half-laughs to herself as

02:30:47.695 --> 02:30:53.078
the smoke bomb gets lobbed. She begins moving her
hands like that to begin casting a spell.

02:30:53.078 --> 02:30:57.838
LAURA: I let go of my arrow and cast Conjure
Barrage with a holy arrow at them.

02:30:57.838 --> 02:30:59.968
MATT: With a holy arrow at them. All righty.

02:30:59.968 --> 02:31:06.610
MARISHA: And I'm going to, if I can peek around
the corner, start lighting up Sunbeam. They're in

02:31:06.610 --> 02:31:09.735
a nice, pretty line, and I like it. It's hot.

02:31:09.735 --> 02:31:12.419
(laughter)

02:31:12.419 --> 02:31:15.731
MATT: It will take you a moment to get over to
that point because you guys are just coming around

02:31:15.731 --> 02:31:28.155
the corner. So, first things first. Percy, you lob
the smoke bomb. (thud, hiss) This area here fills

02:31:28.155 --> 02:31:29.714
with a billowing smoke.

02:31:29.714 --> 02:31:32.009
TALIESIN: I was shooting it right in front of
them.

02:31:32.009 --> 02:31:37.952
MATT: Yeah, it fills this area here. It's a 20 by
20-foot-- it's essentially a recreation of the Fog

02:31:37.952 --> 02:31:44.868
spell for a short duration. It fills that vicinity
there. As the smoke fills, you want to Conjure

02:31:44.868 --> 02:31:46.464
Barrage into the smoke?

02:31:46.464 --> 02:31:49.752
LAURA: Yeah, I know they're all there, and it
shoots a cone of arrows at them.

02:31:49.752 --> 02:31:51.815
MATT: Yeah. All right, roll for that.

02:31:51.815 --> 02:31:56.822
LAURA: It's holy arrows. All of them will be holy
arrows, because Conjure Barrage uses whatever kind

02:31:56.822 --> 02:31:58.389
of ammunition I have shot.

02:31:58.389 --> 02:31:59.501
MATT: That it does.

02:31:59.501 --> 02:32:01.574
(cheering)

02:32:01.574 --> 02:32:04.985
MATT: So what's the saving throw on that?

02:32:04.985 --> 02:32:11.092
LAURA: Oh, that's a good question. Conjure Barrage
is-- dexterity save.

02:32:11.092 --> 02:32:21.748
MATT: We're going to grave. There we go. Proper
Briarwood music.

02:32:21.748 --> 02:32:23.314
LIAM: Surprise, motherfucker!

02:32:23.314 --> 02:32:25.572
MATT: All right, so.

02:32:25.572 --> 02:32:36.409
LIAM: I don't know why my sister is firing at me,
but I would like to use Uncanny Dodge or Evasion,

02:32:36.472 --> 02:32:39.790
whichever is applicable in this moment, so I don't
get hurt.

02:32:39.790 --> 02:32:42.383
LAURA: There's a whole lot of arrows flying at
you, just letting you know.

02:32:42.383 --> 02:32:46.294
MATT: I believe Uncanny Dodge, you just roll a saving
throw, and if you make it, you take no damage.

02:32:46.354 --> 02:32:47.640
LIAM: So dexterity, right?

02:32:47.640 --> 02:32:48.846
MATT: I believe so, yeah.

02:32:48.846 --> 02:32:50.936
LIAM: That's pretty good. That's a 28.

02:32:50.936 --> 02:32:53.398
MATT: Okay. Damage on that was?

02:32:53.398 --> 02:32:57.862
LAURA: 3d8, plus whatever the holy would be?

02:32:57.862 --> 02:33:00.659
MATT: The holy is an additional 1d4 radiant
damage.

02:33:00.659 --> 02:33:02.205
LAURA: Okay, for each?

02:33:02.205 --> 02:33:04.318
MATT: For anybody that would be affected by it.

02:33:04.318 --> 02:33:12.638
LAURA: Okay. Oh, that's it? I just do that? 3d8,
that's it?

02:33:12.638 --> 02:33:13.583
MATT: Yep.

02:33:13.583 --> 02:33:14.870
LAURA: Nine.

02:33:14.870 --> 02:33:17.156
MATT: Nine. Not including the d4, right?

02:33:17.156 --> 02:33:18.305
LAURA: Not including the d4.

02:33:18.305 --> 02:33:26.534
MATT: So that's four damage to both Sylas and
Cassandra. You take no damage from it because of

02:33:26.534 --> 02:33:27.632
Uncanny Dodge.

02:33:27.632 --> 02:33:29.892
LIAM: I call out and say, Vex'ahlia, what are you
doing?

02:33:29.892 --> 02:33:36.708
MATT: All right, so roll a d4.

02:33:36.708 --> 02:33:38.586
LAURA: Two.

02:33:38.586 --> 02:33:45.650
MATT: Two. Okay. Two additional points of damage
to Sylas. All right, and as the smoke begins to

02:33:45.650 --> 02:33:46.502
dissipate?

02:33:46.502 --> 02:33:52.395
TALIESIN: I'm going to start running. I'm booking
to the right, and I don't have any more actions,

02:33:52.395 --> 02:33:53.398
do I?

02:33:53.398 --> 02:34:01.064
MATT: No, that's going to be your go. Everyone
now? Roll initiative for the beginning of the

02:34:01.064 --> 02:34:02.421
Briarwood battle.

02:34:02.421 --> 02:34:04.685
TALIESIN: Ugh, oh my god.

02:34:04.685 --> 02:34:07.853
MARISHA: I have the shittiest fucking initiative
rolls.

02:34:07.853 --> 02:34:11.208
TALIESIN: That's stupid.

02:34:11.208 --> 02:34:13.449
MARISHA: Yeah, so is mine.

02:34:13.449 --> 02:34:17.578
TALIESIN: Getting it all out of my system now.

02:34:17.681 --> 02:34:20.264
LIAM: Me too. I call it dying.

02:34:20.264 --> 02:34:23.161
TALIESIN: (laughs) That's how you get it all 
out of your system.

02:34:23.161 --> 02:34:26.119
MATT: All right. 25 to 20?

02:34:26.119 --> 02:34:28.544
SAM: Nobody.

02:34:28.544 --> 02:34:29.601
MATT: All right.

02:34:29.601 --> 02:34:31.032
MARISHA: Nobody. We all ate it.

02:34:31.032 --> 02:34:32.731
MATT: 20 to 15?

02:34:32.731 --> 02:34:34.309
SAM: 17.

02:34:34.309 --> 02:34:35.615
TRAVIS: 15.

02:34:35.615 --> 02:34:37.701
SAM: I have the highest initiative?!

02:34:37.701 --> 02:34:39.169
LIAM: 16.

02:34:39.169 --> 02:34:40.533
MATT: 16?

02:34:40.533 --> 02:34:42.643
LAURA: This is a problem.

02:34:42.643 --> 02:34:43.929
MATT: All righty.

02:34:43.929 --> 02:34:52.699
MARISHA: Fuck. We don't get the drop on them
because we were sneaking around?

02:34:52.699 --> 02:34:56.459
MATT: Nope. 15 to ten?

02:34:56.522 --> 02:34:57.872
LAURA: 11.

02:34:57.872 --> 02:34:59.418
ASHLEY: 13.

02:34:59.418 --> 02:35:00.621
TALIESIN: Ten.

02:35:00.621 --> 02:35:01.676
MATT: All right.

02:35:01.676 --> 02:35:03.872
TALIESIN: Worst initiative I've ever rolled.

02:35:03.872 --> 02:35:05.145
LAURA: 11.

02:35:05.145 --> 02:35:08.139
MATT: 11, and Pike, what did you get? Sorry,
Taliesin.

02:35:08.139 --> 02:35:09.399
TALIESIN: Ten.

02:35:09.399 --> 02:35:15.102
MATT: All right, so Vex and Taliesin.

02:35:15.102 --> 02:35:16.301
LAURA: We're going to die.

02:35:16.301 --> 02:35:18.589
TALIESIN: (laughing nervously) We're going to be
fine.

02:35:18.589 --> 02:35:21.290
LAURA: All my dice. Every dice! I don't have any
dice left to roll.

02:35:21.290 --> 02:35:29.401
MATT: At this point in time, Delilah steps this
way, outside of the smoke, (coughs) moving out of

02:35:29.401 --> 02:35:36.101
the way. You can see, there is a slight shimmer
around her form at the moment.

02:35:36.101 --> 02:35:37.788
MARISHA: A slight shimmer?

02:35:37.788 --> 02:35:47.607
MATT: Yes. She is going to begin by looking over
to you, who threw that bomb at her, put out her

02:35:47.607 --> 02:35:49.002
hand, and say--

02:35:49.002 --> 02:35:50.197
TALIESIN: Can she see me?

02:35:50.197 --> 02:35:51.603
MATT: She stepped out of the smoke.

02:35:51.603 --> 02:35:54.035
TALIESIN: Okay, because I moved. Bomb, then ran.

02:35:54.035 --> 02:35:55.475
SAM: There's smoke between them.

02:35:55.475 --> 02:35:56.506
TALIESIN: There's smoke between us.

02:35:56.506 --> 02:36:01.923
MATT: In this area? Oh, yeah, so she would look
around, get out of the way, look for you, sees

02:36:01.923 --> 02:36:04.319
nothing but a bear that has climbed to the top.

02:36:04.352 --> 02:36:06.191
TALIESIN: I turned into a bear. It's Willow!

02:36:06.191 --> 02:36:08.945
LIAM: Is it a bear, or is it fat Percy?

02:36:08.945 --> 02:36:10.595
TALIESIN: It's fat Percy.

02:36:10.595 --> 02:36:16.846
MATT: Technically, it is. She looks very confused
for a second. "Percy?"

02:36:16.846 --> 02:36:22.275
LIAM: Wait, question! Am I still Percy?

02:36:22.275 --> 02:36:24.186
LAURA: You still look like Percy.

02:36:24.186 --> 02:36:29.110
LIAM: If she's fooled by a fat Percy, she's surely
fooled by a svelte Percy. Does she think she has

02:36:29.110 --> 02:36:30.374
Percy? What's going on?

02:36:30.374 --> 02:36:33.167
MATT: This Seeming spell has fucked everything
up.

02:36:33.167 --> 02:36:36.008
(laughter)

02:36:36.008 --> 02:36:45.232
MATT: No. They can still see the illusion, but you
get the sense that she can see through it, meaning

02:36:45.232 --> 02:36:47.384
it's almost like the two layers are over top.

02:36:47.384 --> 02:36:50.872
LIAM: So she can see big Percy, but realizes it's
not big Percy.

02:36:50.872 --> 02:36:51.824
MATT: It's not big Percy.

02:36:51.824 --> 02:36:52.832
LIAM: It's just absurd.

02:36:52.832 --> 02:36:55.955
MATT: She can see a bear wearing a Percy costume,
is how it looks to her.

02:36:55.955 --> 02:37:00.112
TALIESIN: That's a bear wearing a Percy costume.

02:37:00.112 --> 02:37:04.626
MATT: She actually looks around and sees the weird
Percy, sees nobody else in the area-- she can't

02:37:04.626 --> 02:37:09.427
see you because of your stealth, even though the
Conjure Barrage was in the middle of the fog

02:37:09.427 --> 02:37:13.432
cloud, it prevented her from keeping sight on
anybody, and you're out of the way, so the only

02:37:13.432 --> 02:37:15.817
thing she can see right now is weird Trinket.

02:37:15.817 --> 02:37:17.428
LAURA: I wanted to use my bonus action to hide.

02:37:17.428 --> 02:37:23.995
LIAM: I see her confused look, and I call out,
we're all Percy! Get it?

02:37:23.995 --> 02:37:27.678
LAURA: 29.

02:37:27.678 --> 02:37:37.993
MATT: Okay, good to know. She, not really knowing
what to do, goes, "Sylas. Take this boon." She

02:37:37.993 --> 02:37:40.163
puts her hand out, and you can see a bit of dust
form in there.

02:37:40.163 --> 02:37:41.625
MARISHA: Take this spoon?

02:37:41.625 --> 02:37:42.630
TALIESIN and TRAVIS: Boon.

02:37:42.630 --> 02:37:44.208
MARISHA and TALIESIN: This spoon!

02:37:44.208 --> 02:37:50.792
MATT: She casts a spell on him. That ends her
turn. And then she steps back into the side of the

02:37:50.792 --> 02:37:51.920
fog there.

02:37:51.920 --> 02:37:53.401
TRAVIS: She inspired him?

02:37:53.401 --> 02:37:55.059
MATT: You don't know.

02:37:55.059 --> 02:37:56.274
LAURA: She helped him.

02:37:56.274 --> 02:37:57.504
MATT: Scanlan, you're up.

02:37:57.504 --> 02:37:59.794
SAM: All right, I hear talking?

02:37:59.794 --> 02:38:01.880
MATT: You hear talking. You come around the
corner?

02:38:01.880 --> 02:38:03.145
SAM: I come around the corner.

02:38:03.145 --> 02:38:05.584
MATT: Okay, you're about here, so you can move
forward.

02:38:05.584 --> 02:38:12.580
SAM: The second I see her, Delilah, I will cast
Lightning Bolt on her.

02:38:12.580 --> 02:38:14.020
MATT: Okay.

02:38:14.020 --> 02:38:15.855
LAURA: Lightning Bolt? She's immune.

02:38:15.855 --> 02:38:17.326
SAM: I don't know anything.

02:38:17.326 --> 02:38:20.560
MATT: All right, you see her jump back into the
cloud, and you unleash.

02:38:20.560 --> 02:38:23.529
SAM: Actually, are they in a line? Is there a way
I could get in a line?

02:38:23.529 --> 02:38:29.058
MATT: Not with this pillar there, no. This
pillar's blocking the way. Right now, you're only seeing

02:38:29.058 --> 02:38:33.373
her, at this point, since she goes into this fog
cloud, so you can throw it in the direction she

02:38:33.443 --> 02:38:34.888
is, if you want to.

02:38:34.888 --> 02:38:37.450
SAM: I wouldn't know anything about her, so yeah.
I blast.

02:38:37.450 --> 02:38:40.337
MATT: You release the bolt of lightning. Roll 8d6
damage.

02:38:40.337 --> 02:38:41.871
TALIESIN: Were you there for that fight?

02:38:41.871 --> 02:38:42.865
SAM: I don't know. Was I?

02:38:42.865 --> 02:38:44.311
LAURA: Yeah, you were there for that fight.

02:38:44.311 --> 02:38:45.649
SAM: Would I know anything?

02:38:45.649 --> 02:38:46.611
LIAM: That was ages ago.

02:38:46.611 --> 02:38:47.769
LAURA: It was a long time ago.

02:38:47.769 --> 02:38:52.035
MATT: You recall that lightning seemed to not have
the impact it usually does.

02:38:52.035 --> 02:38:53.739
SAM: Would I know that enough not to cast it?

02:38:53.739 --> 02:39:00.055
MATT: I would say, through all the thoughts and
preparation for this fight, if you would like to

02:39:00.055 --> 02:39:03.144
rescind that, you would be ready to Lightning Bolt
and be like, "Wait, no. That didn't work."

02:39:03.144 --> 02:39:16.655
SAM: All right, then undo. I will undo, and I will
instead-- I will try to blind her.

02:39:16.655 --> 02:39:18.345
MATT: Okay.

02:39:18.345 --> 02:39:23.333
TALIESIN: That's a great idea. Spectacularly great
idea.

02:39:23.333 --> 02:39:28.399
LAURA: Silence her would be good, too.

02:39:28.399 --> 02:39:32.085
SAM: Through my Hand Cone of Clarity.

02:39:32.085 --> 02:39:34.892
MATT: All right. What's the saving throw on that
one?

02:39:34.892 --> 02:39:36.313
SAM: It would be 19.

02:39:36.313 --> 02:39:41.066
MATT: And what is the saving throw? Is it wisdom?

02:39:41.066 --> 02:39:49.371
SAM: Oh, I'm sorry. Blindness. Oh, Jesus. I never
use it, so I don't know. Blindness is a

02:39:49.371 --> 02:39:50.943
constitution saving throw.

02:39:50.943 --> 02:39:54.075
MATT: Constitution for Delilah. Yeah, she makes
it.

02:39:54.075 --> 02:39:55.607
SAM: She makes it?

02:39:55.607 --> 02:39:58.309
MATT: Rolled 18 plus three. 21.

02:39:58.309 --> 02:39:59.526
MARISHA: Bitch.

02:39:59.526 --> 02:40:02.924
SAM: So I wave at her.

02:40:02.924 --> 02:40:04.997
(laughter)

02:40:04.997 --> 02:40:05.825
SAM: Hi.

02:40:05.825 --> 02:40:07.617
MATT: She vanishes into the smoke cloud that Percy
had left.

02:40:07.617 --> 02:40:09.021
SAM: Is that my movement?

02:40:09.021 --> 02:40:11.665
MATT: You can move a little closer if you want
to.

02:40:11.665 --> 02:40:14.356
SAM: Can I get the pillar between us?

02:40:14.356 --> 02:40:15.448
MATT: You can get there.

02:40:15.448 --> 02:40:17.900
SAM: And can I see anyone else?

02:40:17.900 --> 02:40:18.674
MATT: No.

02:40:18.674 --> 02:40:19.925
SAM: Okay. Then that's it.

02:40:19.925 --> 02:40:23.042
MATT: Okay, that ends your turn, Scanlan. Vax,
you're up.

02:40:23.042 --> 02:40:26.658
LIAM: What do I do in this situation? I trust
them, but I also trust them?

02:40:26.658 --> 02:40:34.025
MATT: You trust them both, and right now, they've
made an aggressive action against the Briarwoods.

02:40:34.025 --> 02:40:37.665
The next one you see, you're probably going to
go ahead and try to make an aggressive action.

02:40:37.665 --> 02:40:44.760
LIAM: I'm going to do whatever you tell me. Were I
to see her, the most important person to me in the

02:40:44.850 --> 02:40:50.671
world, act on Lady Briarwood, I'd be like,
"What's up, that's Lady Briarwood, kill her?"

02:40:50.671 --> 02:40:56.296
MATT: You would try and attack her to try to
convince her to stop the assault, probably.

02:40:56.296 --> 02:40:59.518
LIAM: Okay, and I've seen Trinket and I've seen
Scanlan?

02:40:59.518 --> 02:41:00.503
MATT: You've seen Percy.

02:41:00.503 --> 02:41:01.539
LIAM: I've seen Percy?

02:41:01.539 --> 02:41:04.901
MATT: Scanlan you haven't seen yet. You're still
inside this cloud. All you've seen is Percy. You

02:41:04.901 --> 02:41:08.174
didn't even see her strike at you, other than
seeing the arrows flying in so you know it's her.

02:41:08.174 --> 02:41:12.541
LIAM: Then I'm going to step right in front of
Lady Briarwood and shield her with my body from

02:41:12.541 --> 02:41:13.674
Percy.

02:41:13.674 --> 02:41:14.943
MATT: Okay.

02:41:14.943 --> 02:41:19.900
LIAM: Percival, you've got to stop. This is
madness! This is that spirit of yours.

02:41:19.900 --> 02:41:22.150
MATT: Grog.

02:41:22.150 --> 02:41:24.427
TRAVIS: Can they see me?

02:41:24.427 --> 02:41:29.616
MATT: You're just now coming around the side here,
so it's hard to tell.

02:41:29.616 --> 02:41:31.131
You see a big cloud of smoke.

02:41:31.131 --> 02:41:34.242
TRAVIS: I'm going to hold my turn.

02:41:34.242 --> 02:41:36.668
MATT: You're not going to get any closer?

02:41:36.668 --> 02:41:40.204
TRAVIS: I'd like to put my back against the
column.

02:41:40.204 --> 02:41:44.071
MATT: You use double movement to--

02:41:44.071 --> 02:41:45.503
LAURA: Fall over. And then?

02:41:45.503 --> 02:41:52.357
MATT: To move right there behind the pillar with
your back to it. Okay. That gets us to Sylas.

02:41:52.357 --> 02:41:54.297
MARISHA: Oh boy.

02:41:54.297 --> 02:42:00.617
MATT: Leaping out of the smoke, (whoosh) with an
unnatural speed, Sylas, jumping in the air,

02:42:00.617 --> 02:42:06.227
pulling from the scabbard on his back a long, onyx
two-handed sword you've seen once before. Leaps

02:42:06.227 --> 02:42:08.258
and lands right before you, Percy.

02:42:08.258 --> 02:42:10.626
TALIESIN: He can see me? He can find me in the
smoke?

02:42:10.626 --> 02:42:14.442
MATT: He leapt out of the smoke.

02:42:14.509 --> 02:42:16.047
TALIESIN: Okay.

02:42:16.047 --> 02:42:25.029
MATT: And has a really high passive perception. He
leaps and lands right before you with this grin on

02:42:25.029 --> 02:42:30.918
his face, the blade out in front of him, and says,
"Boy, you poke where you shouldn't." And goes in

02:42:30.918 --> 02:42:45.674
for three attacks on you with his blade. That's a
natural two, so 12? Oh, no that would be 14? That

02:42:45.674 --> 02:42:48.347
is a 34?

02:42:48.347 --> 02:42:51.869
TALIESIN: 34 hits. The other two do not.

02:42:51.869 --> 02:42:53.373
MATT: Oh, 24?

02:42:53.373 --> 02:42:54.878
TALIESIN: 24 still hits.

02:42:54.878 --> 02:42:57.512
MATT: And then that would be his turn, so two
hits.

02:42:57.512 --> 02:42:59.437
SAM: Slow him down.

02:42:59.437 --> 02:43:09.077
MATT: You take 13 points of slashing damage from
the first strike, and then you take ten points of

02:43:09.077 --> 02:43:10.799
slashing damage from the second strike.

02:43:10.799 --> 02:43:12.498
TALIESIN: That's 26 points.

02:43:12.498 --> 02:43:14.077
MATT: I need you to make two constitution saving
throws.

02:43:14.077 --> 02:43:17.076
TALIESIN: 23 points of damage.

02:43:17.076 --> 02:43:19.219
MATT: And make two constitution saving throws.

02:43:19.219 --> 02:43:29.616
TALIESIN: Sorry, just updating my sad little hit
points. Two constitution saving throws?

02:43:29.616 --> 02:43:30.896
MATT: Correct.

02:43:30.896 --> 02:43:36.878
TALIESIN: 11?

02:43:36.878 --> 02:43:38.606
MATT: Okay, and the second one?

02:43:38.606 --> 02:43:43.372
TALIESIN: A critical fail.

02:43:43.372 --> 02:43:47.607
MATT: Okay. You feel as each strike of the blade
cuts into your flesh, a portion of your body's

02:43:47.607 --> 02:43:51.627
strength is sapped from it. Your strength goes
down by two.

02:43:51.627 --> 02:43:54.100
TALIESIN: My strength is a negative one.

02:43:54.100 --> 02:43:56.780
MATT: No, I mean your score. Not the modifier,
your score.

02:43:56.780 --> 02:44:00.887
TALIESIN: Oh, so my strength is at zero, then.

02:44:00.887 --> 02:44:02.455
MATT: What is your strength normally?

02:44:02.455 --> 02:44:03.394
TALIESIN: 12.

02:44:03.394 --> 02:44:04.541
MATT: 12, so it's now ten.

02:44:04.541 --> 02:44:06.934
TALIESIN: It's now ten, which means my modifier is
zero.

02:44:06.934 --> 02:44:09.671
MATT: You see the energy fill him now.

02:44:09.671 --> 02:44:13.793
TRAVIS: I'd take that turn now, if I could.

02:44:13.793 --> 02:44:18.166
MATT: You used your movement and you held your
action. You can now take your action.

02:44:18.166 --> 02:44:19.868
LIAM: Break his head like a melon.

02:44:19.868 --> 02:44:21.821
TRAVIS: I can't get to him now. I used my
movement.

02:44:21.821 --> 02:44:23.993
LIAM and LAURA: Chain!

02:44:23.993 --> 02:44:28.383
TRAVIS: I'll use the Chain of Returning, with the
holy oil on the war hammer.

02:44:28.383 --> 02:44:33.921
MATT: Okay, so as you're behind the pillar, you
see him rush up and slash into Percy. You reach

02:44:33.921 --> 02:44:36.864
around and (throwing noise) release the axe,
spinning towards him with the chain behind it. Not

02:44:36.864 --> 02:44:38.255
the axe, the hammer.

02:44:38.255 --> 02:44:40.526
TRAVIS: 27.

02:44:40.526 --> 02:44:41.483
MATT: That hits.

02:44:41.483 --> 02:44:42.791
LIAM: Get him.

02:44:42.791 --> 02:44:45.008
SAM: That's the first Briarwood damage.

02:44:45.008 --> 02:44:56.210
TRAVIS: 15 damage with the fire and the holy oil
does an extra--

02:44:56.210 --> 02:44:57.329
MATT: 1d4.

02:44:57.329 --> 02:44:59.476
TRAVIS: 16.

02:44:59.476 --> 02:45:04.481
MATT: Okay. 16 points of damage on the strike.
(impact sounds). It slams into him from the side.

02:45:04.481 --> 02:45:09.275
He looks over and you can see where it hit;
there's a burst of radiant energy that's burning

02:45:09.275 --> 02:45:13.633
into his side. He glances down at you with a
frustrated look. Go ahead and make your save to

02:45:13.633 --> 02:45:16.149
try and pull your hammer back.

02:45:16.149 --> 02:45:20.019
TRAVIS: That's a 21.

02:45:20.019 --> 02:45:22.839
MATT: Okay. So that finishes that turn. Pike,
you're up.

02:45:22.904 --> 02:45:29.922
ASHLEY: Okay, I'm going to use Healing Word for
Percy.

02:45:29.985 --> 02:45:34.757
MATT: You have to get within range of him though.
You're on the opposite side of the battlefield,

02:45:34.757 --> 02:45:40.225
so, at full movement you'd be there; with the
range on Healing Word, you wouldn't be able to get

02:45:40.294 --> 02:45:42.313
to him right now in time.

02:45:42.313 --> 02:45:45.932
ASHLEY: Even with a 60-foot range? Am I close?

02:45:45.932 --> 02:45:47.468
MATT: 60 foot?

02:45:47.468 --> 02:45:50.034
SAM: She can't see anything, so she's 80 feet
away.

02:45:50.034 --> 02:45:54.712
MATT: Almost. He's 15 feet outside of your range.
Unless you use your Sprinter's Boots.

02:45:54.712 --> 02:45:59.276
ASHLEY: I'll use my Sprinter's Boots.

02:45:59.329 --> 02:46:00.766
MATT: Okay.

02:46:00.766 --> 02:46:06.649
SAM: Oh god. Just know Ashley, that sprinting in
like this will take you right in front of the

02:46:06.649 --> 02:46:07.632
Briarwoods.

02:46:07.632 --> 02:46:09.349
ASHLEY: Oh, because I can't see the board.

02:46:09.349 --> 02:46:12.355
LAURA: Yeah, that's not a good thing. Maybe it's
better to--

02:46:12.355 --> 02:46:15.138
MARISHA: Can you help Vax? You're really close to
Vax.

02:46:15.138 --> 02:46:17.562
ASHLEY: Oh, am I close to Vax?

02:46:17.562 --> 02:46:20.802
MATT: You are near Vax, yeah.

02:46:20.802 --> 02:46:28.199
ASHLEY: Can I get right behind him and cast
Greater Restoration on him?

02:46:28.199 --> 02:46:32.305
MATT: You can. The fog obscures them; they have
three quarters cover. You can still see their

02:46:32.305 --> 02:46:34.736
shapes in the cloud, it's not completely
obscured.

02:46:34.736 --> 02:46:39.616
LIAM: And there's a pillar between you and me in
the middle of a 30-foot stretch.

02:46:39.616 --> 02:46:42.591
LAURA: So you can hide behind it after you
cast it.

02:46:42.683 --> 02:46:43.948
ASHLEY: Can I try that?

02:46:44.012 --> 02:46:48.527
MATT: You can. So you rush up, around the pillar,
clicking your Sprinter's Boots to give the

02:46:48.527 --> 02:46:53.056
distance, you rush up into the cloud, right into
the face of Vax. And Vax, you look down at Pike,

02:46:53.056 --> 02:46:56.489
now aggressively coming towards you. Protecting
Lady Briarwood, you pull your daggers out

02:46:56.489 --> 02:47:01.704
instinctively and look down at her with a look of
"What are you doing?" You reach forward and reach

02:47:01.704 --> 02:47:12.089
out your hands against him. Let me check
Restoration real fast. Let me see here, Greater

02:47:12.089 --> 02:47:20.888
Restoration. 5th level. Ends effects like charmed
or petrified. As you reach out and touch him you

02:47:20.888 --> 02:47:27.140
feel the impact of the Briarwoods' influence fade
from your mind. As she touches you, the charm is

02:47:27.140 --> 02:47:32.591
dispelled and you look at your daggers and look
where you are and look at the moments and the last

02:47:32.591 --> 02:47:34.253
few minutes and you're like--

02:47:34.253 --> 02:47:40.105
LIAM: Then can I look up and stay in a defensive
stance and back towards Lady Briarwood?

02:47:40.105 --> 02:47:41.357
SAM: Oh, feigning?

02:47:41.357 --> 02:47:45.400
MATT: You know what, make a deception check.

02:47:45.400 --> 02:47:47.847
TRAVIS: (laughing) Slick!

02:47:47.847 --> 02:47:50.622
LIAM: 12.

02:47:50.622 --> 02:47:57.757
MATT: Okay. You back up into a defensive position
towards Lady Briarwood. Okay, that's just from

02:47:57.757 --> 02:48:00.886
immediate reaction to that. Pike, do you want to
stay where you are, do you want to use the rest of

02:48:00.886 --> 02:48:03.200
your movement to move back behind the pillar?

02:48:03.200 --> 02:48:04.086
TRAVIS: Cover.

02:48:04.086 --> 02:48:05.514
ASHLEY: I'll move back behind the pillar.

02:48:05.514 --> 02:48:08.923
MATT: Okay. All right.

02:48:08.923 --> 02:48:10.774
SAM: Any bonus moves there, Pikey?

02:48:10.774 --> 02:48:14.366
ASHLEY: No. I'm going to wait.

02:48:14.366 --> 02:48:15.978
MATT: Vex, you're up.

02:48:15.978 --> 02:48:27.491
LAURA: Me? I'm going to shoot my storm arrow. I'm
going to shoot from my Longbow of the Sky

02:48:27.491 --> 02:48:34.857
Sentinel. At Lord Briarwood. At Sylas.

02:48:34.857 --> 02:48:36.344
MATT: Okay, go for it.

02:48:36.344 --> 02:48:46.359
LAURA: Okay. Well, Percy. That one didn't work.
That's a natural one for the first. That's three

02:48:46.359 --> 02:48:50.194
arrows, though. The second one's good, that's a
25.

02:48:50.194 --> 02:48:51.655
MATT: All right, that hits.

02:48:51.655 --> 02:48:55.269
LAURA: And the last one is a 29.

02:48:55.269 --> 02:48:56.627
MATT: Okay, those two hit.

02:48:56.627 --> 02:49:18.527
LAURA: Okay, so that is an extra 1d6 lightning
damage for every attack. 15 for the first one, and

02:49:18.527 --> 02:49:24.997
then... 15 for the second one.

02:49:24.997 --> 02:49:26.635
MATT: Okay.

02:49:26.635 --> 02:49:32.624
LAURA: And that was -- Oh no. Yeah, that's it. And
that's the first attack. The second attack is

02:49:32.624 --> 02:49:33.676
another shot.

02:49:33.676 --> 02:49:34.755
MATT: Correct.

02:49:34.755 --> 02:49:38.293
LAURA: With a holy arrow. At him again.

02:49:38.293 --> 02:49:39.291
MATT: Yup.

02:49:39.291 --> 02:49:41.378
LAURA: Okay, so 25.

02:49:41.378 --> 02:49:42.501
MATT: That hits.

02:49:42.501 --> 02:49:43.547
LAURA: Okay.

02:49:43.547 --> 02:49:45.318
MATT: Keyleth, what was your initiative again?

02:49:45.318 --> 02:49:49.302
MARISHA: Bringing up the rears.

02:49:49.302 --> 02:49:50.261
MATT: Yeah.

02:49:50.261 --> 02:49:52.987
LAURA: 15, for the last hit, too.

02:49:52.987 --> 02:49:57.374
MATT: Nice. All right, so as you're floating up
above you pull back your arrow and inciting the

02:49:57.374 --> 02:50:03.032
magical enchantment of the bow, you release and as
it does it (crack crack) crackles with energy and

02:50:03.032 --> 02:50:07.473
splits into three separate arrows that arc around
each other almost like a helix of DNA. As they all

02:50:07.473 --> 02:50:11.780
streak downward they (impact noises) slam into
Sylas from the other side him now being assaulted

02:50:11.780 --> 02:50:13.964
on all fronts.

02:50:13.964 --> 02:50:18.299
LAURA: I use my bonus action to hide again.

02:50:18.508 --> 02:50:24.151
MATT: Okay. Well you're still out in plain sight.
Unless you're pulling way, way back. If you want

02:50:24.151 --> 02:50:25.773
to pull back towards the shadow.

02:50:25.773 --> 02:50:26.815
LAURA: I want to hide.

02:50:26.815 --> 02:50:30.124
MATT: Okay. So you pull further and further away
from it. Go ahead and make a stealth check.

02:50:30.124 --> 02:50:33.467
TRAVIS: Flying Vex is pretty dope. (laughs)

02:50:33.467 --> 02:50:35.332
LAURA: Natural 20.

02:50:35.332 --> 02:50:37.872
(cheering)

02:50:37.872 --> 02:50:42.056
MATT: Vanish into the shadow of the sky. You dart
out of the darkness and then disappear back into

02:50:42.056 --> 02:50:47.474
it. All right. That ends your turn. Percy, you're
up.

02:50:47.474 --> 02:51:02.694
TALIESIN: I just got blasted. What's that thing I
can do? I'm going to use a bonus action to do my

02:51:02.694 --> 02:51:04.792
little healing surge that I can do.

02:51:04.792 --> 02:51:05.978
MATT: Okay.

02:51:05.978 --> 02:51:13.693
TALIESIN: My fighter ability thing, which is 1d10
plus 12, so that's 18 points of damage back.

02:51:13.693 --> 02:51:15.069
MATT: Okay.

02:51:15.069 --> 02:51:16.131
SAM: Nice.

02:51:16.131 --> 02:51:17.579
MARISHA: Good roll.

02:51:17.579 --> 02:51:20.323
SAM: Catch that, Pike? He healed himself.

02:51:20.323 --> 02:51:30.840
TALIESIN: I brought myself up a little bit. Just a
little bit. And I'm going to shove the Diplomacy

02:51:30.840 --> 02:51:38.544
glove right into Sylas's face and try and do a
straight shove to get him off of me. I have never

02:51:38.544 --> 02:51:41.478
used this before. I don't actually know how it
works.

02:51:41.478 --> 02:51:46.346
MATT: Right, and you previously charged this--

02:51:46.346 --> 02:51:50.431
TALISIN: I charged this when I got hit by the
lightning attack in the crypt.

02:51:50.431 --> 02:51:52.092
MARISHA: Oh, that's right!

02:51:52.092 --> 02:51:58.571
MATT: Go ahead and make a melee attack. So this
would be, I'd say--

02:51:58.571 --> 02:51:59.791
TALIESIN: Dex check?

02:51:59.791 --> 02:52:05.784
MATT: I'd say make it dex-based because it's more
of a quick grab on your end. Make a d12 plus your

02:52:05.784 --> 02:52:11.151
proficiency, plus your dex. So plus ten. It's plus
ten.

02:52:11.240 --> 02:52:12.320
TALIESIN: Plus ten to a d20.

02:52:12.320 --> 02:52:13.863
MATT: Yes, you got it.

02:52:13.863 --> 02:52:15.811
TALIESIN: Thank you! That's much better. 22.

02:52:15.811 --> 02:52:22.322
MATT: 22 will hit! So as you reach out and grab
him in the front the energy pulses in front as it

02:52:22.322 --> 02:52:32.821
releases. Go ahead and roll 4d6 points of damage.
Did not make his saving throw on that with a

02:52:32.821 --> 02:52:34.318
four.

02:52:34.318 --> 02:52:41.263
MARISHA: Oh my god! He rolled three sixes and a
five.

02:52:41.263 --> 02:52:45.654
TALIESIN: 23 points of damage.

02:52:45.654 --> 02:52:53.208
MATT: All righty. The shock charges through his
dark armor he (groans). You can see that the dark

02:52:53.259 --> 02:52:59.143
veins pulse through his neck as the energy surges
through his body. He slaps the hand away at this

02:52:59.143 --> 02:53:05.895
point and you can see the smoke and it's (hissing)
off the armor. (growls)

02:53:05.990 --> 02:53:08.485
SAM: Hi.

02:53:08.485 --> 02:53:12.320
MARISHA: What you going to do?

02:53:12.320 --> 02:53:19.138
TALIESIN: I'm going to, Jesus Christ, okay! I
can't really use my gun because I'm too close. I'm

02:53:19.138 --> 02:53:24.960
going to pull out my sword and take two more
slashes and I'm going to run like a mother.

02:53:24.960 --> 02:53:26.037
MATT: Okay.

02:53:26.037 --> 02:53:31.489
TALIESIN: First slash is a 28.

02:53:31.489 --> 02:53:32.775
MATT: Hit.

02:53:32.775 --> 02:53:39.208
TALIESIN: And that's lame. That's 14 points of
damage.

02:53:39.208 --> 02:53:40.376
MATT: Okay.

02:53:40.376 --> 02:53:44.418
TALIESIN: Second slash is 23.

02:53:44.418 --> 02:53:47.366
MATT: 23? Okay, it hits.

02:53:47.366 --> 02:53:52.585
TALIESIN: And that's 11 points of damage. Now I'm
going to book it towards Grog.

02:53:52.585 --> 02:53:58.141
MATT: Okay. You're bolting towards Grog. He's
going to swing at you with the sword as an attack

02:53:58.141 --> 02:54:01.687
of opportunity as he does so. That is 21 to hit.

02:54:01.687 --> 02:54:02.778
TALIESIN: That hits.

02:54:02.778 --> 02:54:11.582
MATT: All right. You take 17 points of slashing
damage as the sword arcs across your back. You

02:54:11.582 --> 02:54:14.640
rush towards Grog on that side. Roll another
constitution saving throw.

02:54:14.640 --> 02:54:17.375
SAM: Oh no. The strength thing.

02:54:17.375 --> 02:54:18.386
TALIESIN: I know.

02:54:18.386 --> 02:54:19.853
MARISHA: Good thing you don't use strength.

02:54:19.853 --> 02:54:20.863
TALIESIN: No.

02:54:20.863 --> 02:54:22.231
SAM: Well, it can still kill you.

02:54:22.231 --> 02:54:27.410
TALIESIN: 15, 16, 17. 22.

02:54:27.410 --> 02:54:32.838
MATT: Okay, you resist the effects of the blade
now, having saved from it. That ends your turn. At

02:54:32.838 --> 02:54:38.283
the end of your turn, Sylas is going to go ahead
and spend one of his legendary actions to get a

02:54:38.283 --> 02:54:45.125
free movement without provoking attacks of
opportunity and shift up with an amazing speed to

02:54:45.125 --> 02:54:50.483
the other side of both. As soon as you rush over
to Grog he appears up in front of you grinning

02:54:50.483 --> 02:54:55.244
with his blade at the ready, right next to you and
Grog. That ends your turn.

02:54:55.244 --> 02:54:57.473
It's now Cassandra's turn.

02:54:57.473 --> 02:55:00.530
MARISHA: Oh, god damn it, what are you going to do?

02:55:00.530 --> 02:55:04.065
TALIESIN: Make the right decision, girl!

02:55:04.065 --> 02:55:06.127
MATT: Roll a perception check, Percy.

02:55:06.127 --> 02:55:07.302
LAURA: Oh!

02:55:07.302 --> 02:55:12.203
TALIESIN: (blows raspberry) Nine.

02:55:12.203 --> 02:55:14.243
MATT: Nine? Roll a perception check, Grog.

02:55:14.243 --> 02:55:16.019
MARISHA: Come on, Grog.

02:55:16.019 --> 02:55:18.584
TRAVIS: 11.

02:55:18.584 --> 02:55:26.788
MATT: Okay. Seemingly out of nowhere, Cassandra
appears from behind the pillar, blade out,

02:55:26.788 --> 02:55:30.088
shortsword at the ready, and attempts to jam it
into the back of Grog.

02:55:30.088 --> 02:55:32.190
LAURA: Sneak Attack damage. She's a rogue!

02:55:32.190 --> 02:55:33.904
MATT: That is 21 to hit.

02:55:33.904 --> 02:55:35.236
TRAVIS: That actually hits me.

02:55:35.236 --> 02:55:36.439
MATT: Okay.

02:55:36.439 --> 02:55:44.667
MARISHA: You can hear all the dice he's picking
up.

02:55:44.752 --> 02:55:48.193
TALIESIN: Oh, goddamn it.

02:55:48.412 --> 02:55:52.216
MATT: 27 points of piercing damage.

02:55:52.216 --> 02:55:53.865
TRAVIS: Halved, because I'm raging.

02:55:53.865 --> 02:55:56.269
MATT: Slashing damage because it's a sword, but
yeah, halved.

02:55:56.269 --> 02:55:58.685
TRAVIS: 13?

02:55:58.685 --> 02:56:01.624
MATT: 13 points of slashing damage from the sneak
attack.

02:56:01.624 --> 02:56:03.014
TALIESIN: That could have been worse.

02:56:03.014 --> 02:56:10.678
MATT: That will end Cassandra's turn. Next up is
Keyleth.

02:56:10.678 --> 02:56:14.503
MARISHA: Oh! Finally. Okay, running up the stairs,
running up the stairs--

02:56:14.503 --> 02:56:18.998
MATT: Well, you've been waiting around the side
here for everyone, so you're just now cresting

02:56:18.998 --> 02:56:20.231
around that corner.

02:56:20.231 --> 02:56:26.562
MARISHA: Beautiful. Can I move to where I'm in a
nice pretty line with a Briarwood and Cassandra?

02:56:26.562 --> 02:56:32.346
Over here? And Sunbeam!

02:56:32.346 --> 02:56:33.856
MATT: Okay.

02:56:33.856 --> 02:56:34.952
ASHLEY: Yes!

02:56:34.952 --> 02:56:37.058
TALIESIN: (sings) Deo gratias!

02:56:37.058 --> 02:56:38.582
MARISHA: Right in a line.

02:56:38.582 --> 02:56:43.326
SAM: Do it. This is it. This is everything, right
here.

02:56:43.326 --> 02:56:44.612
LIAM: Come on, Kiki.

02:56:44.612 --> 02:56:45.971
TALIESIN: You're our cannon.

02:56:45.971 --> 02:56:47.535
MARISHA: I've been waiting.

02:56:47.535 --> 02:56:55.496
MATT: Sunbeam. Yeah, it will hit both him and
Cassandra and Grog.

02:56:55.496 --> 02:56:57.230
SAM: And Grog?

02:56:57.230 --> 02:56:58.648
TRAVIS: Who cares?

02:56:58.648 --> 02:57:02.486
MATT: All right, so a constitution saving throw,
Grog.

02:57:02.486 --> 02:57:03.723
TRAVIS: Constitution.

02:57:03.723 --> 02:57:09.037
MATT: Cassandra makes it with a 21.

02:57:09.037 --> 02:57:10.334
TRAVIS: 16?

02:57:10.334 --> 02:57:11.713
MATT: 16. What's your DC?

02:57:11.713 --> 02:57:12.930
MARISHA: 17.

02:57:12.930 --> 02:57:17.477
MATT: So full damage on Grog, half damage on
Cassandra. I mean no damage. She's going to use

02:57:17.477 --> 02:57:24.758
her reaction to use Uncanny Dodge, so Cassandra
takes no damage from it. Sylas is going to use one

02:57:24.823 --> 02:57:30.234
of his legendary resistances to automatically
succeed on his saving throw, so he takes half

02:57:30.234 --> 02:57:38.236
damage. Oh, they had disadvantage on the saving
throw, but he can automatically make it,

02:57:38.236 --> 02:57:39.551
so never mind.

02:57:39.551 --> 02:57:44.850
MARISHA: 15 plus eight, so that's 23. 23.

02:57:44.850 --> 02:57:45.892
MATT: 23 damage?

02:57:45.892 --> 02:57:46.707
MARISHA: Yes.

02:57:46.707 --> 02:57:57.153
MATT: Okay, halved. He takes 12 points of radiant
damage. So as you rush around the corner, he sees

02:57:57.153 --> 02:58:02.140
you appear again and gives you a look. As the beam
of light appears, his eyes roll back in fear, and

02:58:02.140 --> 02:58:05.802
the blast (fire noise) streaks out, blasting into
Grog, blasting into him--

02:58:05.802 --> 02:58:08.457
MARISHA: Undead and oozes have disadvantage on
saving throws.

02:58:08.457 --> 02:58:12.103
MATT: Correct, but he has the ability to
automatically make the saving throw, as a

02:58:12.103 --> 02:58:17.592
legendary creature. However, as the beam fades,
you can see part of his face is burned to ash, and

02:58:17.592 --> 02:58:21.050
you can see where the lip is gone, the teeth are
exposed, and the sharp fangs.

02:58:21.050 --> 02:58:26.834
MARISHA: And I don't know if this makes any amount
of difference, but for the duration of the spell,

02:58:26.834 --> 02:58:31.900
I have a 30-foot radius sunlight glowing in my
hand.

02:58:31.900 --> 02:58:32.991
MATT: Correct.

02:58:32.991 --> 02:58:35.128
MARISHA: So it's bright in here now.

02:58:35.128 --> 02:58:38.382
LAURA: I like it. Now I can see. Oh, shit!

02:58:38.382 --> 02:58:40.052
TRAVIS: As long as he's in that circle.

02:58:40.052 --> 02:58:42.579
MATT: All right.

02:58:42.579 --> 02:58:44.843
TALIESIN: Yeah. Just keep on him.

02:58:44.843 --> 02:58:46.468
MARISHA: Yeah, it's a 30-foot radius.

02:58:46.468 --> 02:58:57.956
MATT: Okay, so that ends Keyleth's turn. Back to
the top, Delilah. Delilah is now going to step out

02:58:57.956 --> 02:58:59.676
of the cloud, which is now dissipating at this
point.

02:58:59.676 --> 02:59:01.277
LIAM: Is she taking a step away from me?

02:59:01.277 --> 02:59:02.116
MATT: Yes.

02:59:02.116 --> 02:59:04.937
LIAM: I'm taking my blade with the poison on it,
and I'm going to slash at her.

02:59:04.937 --> 02:59:06.732
MATT: Okay, as your reaction.

02:59:06.732 --> 02:59:14.537
LIAM: That is an 18.

02:59:14.537 --> 02:59:18.237
MATT: 18 would hit her.

02:59:18.237 --> 02:59:25.059
LIAM: Okay, that had whatever that poison is that
I sold my soul to a hag for.

02:59:25.059 --> 02:59:27.895
MATT: Yes, it did. So roll damage on that.

02:59:27.895 --> 02:59:30.579
LIAM: Okay, so the regular damage is--

02:59:30.579 --> 02:59:32.907
LAURA: Don't say you sold your soul to a hag.

02:59:32.907 --> 02:59:40.611
LIAM: Let's deal with one problem at a time!
That's a ten for just the damage.

02:59:40.611 --> 02:59:47.796
MATT: Okay. Roll an additional 6d6 poison damage.

02:59:47.796 --> 02:59:49.223
SAM: 6d6?

02:59:49.223 --> 02:59:50.879
LAURA: That's a Sneak Attack.

02:59:50.879 --> 02:59:54.362
LIAM: No, this is poison. I'm not in a position to
sneak attack.

02:59:54.362 --> 02:59:57.373
LAURA: But this is the same as a sneak attack.

02:59:57.373 --> 03:00:04.558
LIAM: 12, 13, 19, 24 points of poison.

03:00:04.558 --> 03:00:17.150
MATT: All right, so as you strike out, the blade
scrapes across the front of her... shit, I forgot

03:00:17.232 --> 03:00:23.997
that. I'll keep that in mind for next time. The
blade streaks across the front of her body as she

03:00:23.997 --> 03:00:28.157
runs past, (pained gasp) then you feel, as she
takes a few steps away, (groans) and she coughs

03:00:28.157 --> 03:00:33.129
and blood spatters across the ground. She looks
over her shoulder at you. (heavy breathing)

03:00:33.129 --> 03:00:35.113
LIAM: I just stare with a half-cocked smile.

03:00:35.113 --> 03:00:45.687
MATT: She immediately looks back at you and says,
"You boy, stay still!" And puts her hand out

03:00:45.687 --> 03:00:48.744
towards you. I need you to--

03:00:48.744 --> 03:00:51.606
LIAM: Advantage, because I'm a half elf. I don't
need anything because I'm a half-elf.

03:00:51.606 --> 03:00:53.908
LAURA: Is she blinded?

03:00:53.908 --> 03:00:55.522
SAM: It didn't work.

03:00:55.522 --> 03:01:00.478
LIAM: Is she trying to charm me or hold me?

03:01:00.478 --> 03:01:01.919
MATT: Nope!

03:01:01.919 --> 03:01:04.741
LIAM: Trying to disintegrate me to death?

03:01:04.741 --> 03:01:16.375
MATT: She looks over to you and mutters under her
breath (foreign word). It's a phrase you've never

03:01:16.375 --> 03:01:18.226
heard before, but as soon as it happens--

03:01:18.226 --> 03:01:20.806
SAM: As soon as she does that-- do I see this?

03:01:20.806 --> 03:01:23.654
MATT: You're just around the side of this.

03:01:23.654 --> 03:01:25.138
SAM: I do not see it.

03:01:25.138 --> 03:01:29.210
MATT: You glance around the side for
three-quarters cover. Roll a perception check.

03:01:29.210 --> 03:01:37.655
SAM: It's a dead roll, a dead roll, it's between
two. That's terrible. Four.

03:01:37.655 --> 03:01:44.152
MATT: Yeah, you do not see this happening,
unfortunately. Your mind suddenly goes blank as

03:01:44.152 --> 03:01:49.269
the Power Word that's spoken suddenly stuns you in
place, unable to react.

03:01:49.269 --> 03:01:50.712
LIAM: Is it a wisdom thing?

03:01:50.712 --> 03:01:56.419
MATT: There's no saving throw. If you have less
than 150 hit points, you are stunned for the next

03:01:56.419 --> 03:01:58.763
minute. You have to make a saving throw every turn
to resist it.

03:01:58.763 --> 03:02:02.048
SAM: Okay! She's strong.

03:02:02.048 --> 03:02:08.207
MATT: So you stop there. Your daggers (clanking
noise) drop to the ground as the smoke begins to

03:02:08.207 --> 03:02:09.389
dissipate around you.

03:02:09.389 --> 03:02:11.681
LIAM: Do the daggers then shunt back up to my
belt, though?

03:02:11.681 --> 03:02:14.037
MATT: Just the cycle?

03:02:14.037 --> 03:02:17.300
(laughter)

03:02:17.300 --> 03:02:23.853
MATT: No, it's more of a willful return. Once you
regain your composure, you can will them back to

03:02:23.853 --> 03:02:29.804
you. But currently you're drooling out of your
mouth, staring into space right there. She moves

03:02:29.804 --> 03:02:39.332
off to this side and gets behind Cassandra for
protection. She's going to end her turn. She did

03:02:39.332 --> 03:02:43.993
waste her action that turn to do that. Scanlan,
you're up.

03:02:43.993 --> 03:02:55.385
SAM: Yeah man, she's powerful. I will step out
again, from behind. And I will try again. But this

03:02:55.385 --> 03:03:02.251
time I will say, hey, you paralyzed my friend,
let's see if you like it! And I'll try to hold

03:03:02.251 --> 03:03:04.868
her. Hold Person.

03:03:04.868 --> 03:03:07.413
MATT: To Hold Person, okay. A DC of 19, you said
for that?

03:03:07.413 --> 03:03:08.369
SAM: Yes.

03:03:08.369 --> 03:03:21.103
MATT: All right. She's going to make a wisdom
saving throw. She rolls a 21. A natural 19 with a

03:03:21.103 --> 03:03:29.026
plus two. I know. But as the spell shoots out from
your hands, it bounces off of her, seemingly to no

03:03:29.026 --> 03:03:37.648
effect. She is inherently a very powerful caster,
and her defenses show that. Do you want to use

03:03:37.648 --> 03:03:40.388
your movement to move closer, or do you want to
stay where you are?

03:03:40.388 --> 03:03:42.244
SAM: That's Vax near me, right there?

03:03:42.244 --> 03:03:43.206
MATT: Vax is right there, yeah.

03:03:43.206 --> 03:03:47.224
SAM: I'm going to-- shit. Hide behind you?

03:03:47.224 --> 03:03:48.445
LIAM: Sure, I'm bigger than you.

03:03:48.445 --> 03:03:58.476
SAM: I will use my bonus action to inspire Percy,
and I'll say, (sings) Percy's got a gun.

03:03:58.476 --> 03:04:07.890
Percy's got a gun. And then, yeah. Sure! I'll try
to duck behind Vax for cover.

03:04:07.890 --> 03:04:09.909
LIAM: The whole world's come undone.

03:04:09.909 --> 03:04:14.825
MATT: Okay, that'll get you to about there. Okay!
That'll end your turn. Vax, you're up. You spend

03:04:14.825 --> 03:04:17.980
your turn staring off into space. At the end of
your turn, make a constitution saving throw.

03:04:17.980 --> 03:04:21.648
LIAM: Okay. Right now? 14.

03:04:21.648 --> 03:04:27.976
MATT: 14. Yeah, unfortunately you're still caught
there, staring off into the darkness. Looking out

03:04:27.976 --> 03:04:29.686
over the rest of this cavern before you.

03:04:29.686 --> 03:04:31.094
LIAM: It's a constitution?

03:04:31.094 --> 03:04:33.232
MATT: It's a constitution, yeah.

03:04:33.232 --> 03:04:34.318
LIAM: Okay.

03:04:34.318 --> 03:04:36.224
MATT: All right. Grog, you're up.

03:04:36.224 --> 03:04:45.624
TRAVIS: I'd like to go into a frenzied rage, and I
would like to see and swing away at Lord

03:04:45.624 --> 03:04:46.885
Briarwood.

03:04:46.885 --> 03:04:47.965
TALIESIN: Yeah!

03:04:47.965 --> 03:04:55.866
MATT: All righty. Actually, real fast, before that
happens, at the end of Vax's turn, Sylas is going

03:04:55.866 --> 03:05:06.781
to use one of his secondary legendary actions to
move without his movement, again back over to this

03:05:06.781 --> 03:05:11.381
side of the pillar. He darts around.

03:05:11.381 --> 03:05:15.129
TRAVIS: Well, he left. Cassandra's there.

03:05:15.129 --> 03:05:17.882
MATT: You can still move during your turn if you
want to. But if you want to go after

03:05:17.882 --> 03:05:19.013
Cassandra you can.

03:05:19.013 --> 03:05:22.373
TRAVIS: She would get an attack of opportunity,
wouldn't she? I'm going to turn her into

03:05:22.373 --> 03:05:23.437
applesauce.

03:05:23.437 --> 03:05:24.394
MATT: Okay.

03:05:24.394 --> 03:05:25.439
(laughter)

03:05:25.439 --> 03:05:31.975
TRAVIS: Sorry. Not really sorry. 21.

03:05:31.975 --> 03:05:33.191
MATT: That hits.

03:05:33.191 --> 03:05:36.182
TRAVIS: Same thing, 21.

03:05:36.182 --> 03:05:37.299
MATT: That hits.

03:05:37.299 --> 03:05:38.942
TRAVIS: And a 14.

03:05:38.942 --> 03:05:40.360
MATT: 14 misses.

03:05:40.360 --> 03:05:48.285
TRAVIS: 17. 24.

03:05:48.285 --> 03:05:51.111
MATT: 24 damage, on the first one?

03:05:51.111 --> 03:05:57.756
TRAVIS: 24 for the first one. And 22 for the
second one.

03:05:57.756 --> 03:05:58.971
MATT: Okay.

03:05:58.971 --> 03:06:02.041
TRAVIS: But she doesn't take any holy damage off
of the oil on the thing, right?

03:06:02.041 --> 03:06:06.039
MATT: No, but as the hammer slams into her armor
she gets slammed against the pillar from the

03:06:06.039 --> 03:06:10.626
impact of it. She tries to right herself and push
off against the wall. You use the momentum to spin

03:06:10.626 --> 03:06:13.550
around and hit her in the other side, slamming her
up against the wall on the side of the structure

03:06:13.550 --> 03:06:17.523
and you hear her breath escape and she goes
(gasping breath). Is having to catch her breath.

03:06:17.523 --> 03:06:20.480
And she looks at you with this look of "That
really hurt!"

03:06:20.480 --> 03:06:24.663
TRAVIS: Yeah, I've been known to take a lady's
breath away! (laughs)

03:06:24.663 --> 03:06:30.040
MATT: You want to move, or will you stay where you
are?

03:06:30.040 --> 03:06:31.382
TRAVIS: I'll stay where I am.

03:06:31.382 --> 03:06:48.604
MATT: Okay. That ends your turn. It is now Sylas's
turn. Sylas, looking over this way. He does not

03:06:48.604 --> 03:06:52.134
regenerate any hit points, because of the
multitude of holy and radiant damage he took last

03:06:52.134 --> 03:07:00.959
turn, his regeneration is stunted at the moment.
He has to keep away from Keyleth. He is going to,

03:07:00.959 --> 03:07:25.585
instead... he's in a rough place. Then he's going
to move one, two, three, four, five, six... Nope!

03:07:25.585 --> 03:07:34.912
Actually, he's going to-- you know what? He's
going to take it. He's going to go ahead and

03:07:34.912 --> 03:07:42.141
boldly step into the sunlight, which puts him at
disadvantage with his attacks. But he is going to

03:07:42.141 --> 03:07:45.843
unload on you, Percy, who he marked previously.

03:07:45.843 --> 03:07:48.930
TRAVIS: He marked you?

03:07:48.930 --> 03:07:57.104
MATT: You marked his wife. So that is a 20?

03:07:57.104 --> 03:07:58.834
TALIESIN: Yeah, that hits.

03:07:58.834 --> 03:08:04.084
MATT: Second strike is-- two natural 20s in a row.
With disadvantage, he still crits.

03:08:04.084 --> 03:08:05.643
TRAVIS: Two natural 20s in a row!?

03:08:05.643 --> 03:08:07.217
MATT: Yeah, so with disadvantage he still crit.

03:08:07.217 --> 03:08:08.703
LIAM: Fucking bastard.

03:08:08.703 --> 03:08:10.685
MATT: The last one is a 23.

03:08:10.685 --> 03:08:12.650
MARISHA: With disadvantage he still crit, how?

03:08:12.650 --> 03:08:14.217
MATT: I rolled two natural 20s in a row.

03:08:14.217 --> 03:08:15.965
MARISHA: Oh, you-- yeah, right.

03:08:15.965 --> 03:08:21.268
TALIESIN: I'm so excited about this new character
I'm working on.

03:08:21.268 --> 03:08:23.655
MATT: 14 points of slashing damage from the first
strike.

03:08:23.655 --> 03:08:25.671
TALIESIN: Jesus. Okay, 14.

03:08:25.671 --> 03:08:29.719
MATT: The crit is 27 points of slashing damage.

03:08:29.719 --> 03:08:31.013
TALIESIN: Oh boy.

03:08:31.013 --> 03:08:41.900
MATT: And the last one is 13 points of slashing
damage. Roll three constitution saves.

03:08:41.900 --> 03:08:46.819
TALIESIN: I'll tally up the damage in a minute.

03:08:46.819 --> 03:08:55.224
MATT: Actually, ignore the last attack. Because
technically, Lady Briarwood would have lost her

03:08:55.224 --> 03:08:58.309
concentration on the Haste spell she had on him
from the damage she took earlier.

03:08:58.309 --> 03:09:00.488
TALIESIN: Ignore the last attack?

03:09:00.488 --> 03:09:01.982
MATT: Ignore the last attack.

03:09:01.982 --> 03:09:04.945
TALIESIN: So that would have been-- my first save
is 13?

03:09:04.945 --> 03:09:09.249
MATT: 13? All right, that does succeed.

03:09:09.249 --> 03:09:16.077
TALIESIN: And that's 22, yeah.

03:09:16.077 --> 03:09:17.897
MATT: So you resist the effect of the two
strikes.

03:09:17.897 --> 03:09:19.862
TALIESIN: I'm going to figure out how much damage
I just took.

03:09:19.862 --> 03:09:30.953
MARISHA: 41.

03:09:30.953 --> 03:09:37.080
TALIESIN: No, it's 27, 37-- oh, 41, you're right.
I'm alive.

03:09:37.080 --> 03:09:44.154
MATT: Okay. So that ends Taliesin's turn. Pike,
you're up.

03:09:44.154 --> 03:09:45.583
ALL: Pike!

03:09:45.583 --> 03:09:48.180
ASHLEY: What are you at, Percy?

03:09:48.180 --> 03:09:54.005
TALIESIN: I'm at the other side of the world, but
you could probably get close enough to do

03:09:54.005 --> 03:09:56.040
something if you ran and not get in anybody's
way.

03:09:56.040 --> 03:09:57.692
SAM: He's hurting, but he's not dead.

03:09:57.692 --> 03:10:01.009
LAURA: But he's pretty close to dying.

03:10:01.009 --> 03:10:03.479
ASHLEY: Okay, I'm going to Sprinter's Boot over to
him.

03:10:03.479 --> 03:10:05.912
MATT: How many times can you use Sprinter's
Boots?

03:10:05.912 --> 03:10:07.186
ASHLEY: Say again?

03:10:07.186 --> 03:10:10.087
MATT: Sprinter's Boots. How many times can you use
it? Does it say on the item?

03:10:10.087 --> 03:10:12.286
How long does it last?

03:10:12.286 --> 03:10:16.005
ASHLEY: I can use it twice. I haven't used it
yet.

03:10:16.005 --> 03:10:23.209
MATT: Okay. You're now within 35 feet of him.

03:10:23.209 --> 03:10:27.666
ASHLEY: Okay. Is that within range?

03:10:27.666 --> 03:10:29.258
MATT: For Healing Word it is, yes.

03:10:29.258 --> 03:10:31.588
ASHLEY: All right, so I'll Healing Word.

03:10:31.588 --> 03:10:32.858
MATT: All right.

03:10:32.858 --> 03:10:34.402
LAURA: What about-- oh, sorry.

03:10:34.402 --> 03:10:38.546
TALIESIN: We can inform her of the map though,
since she doesn't have a very--

03:10:38.546 --> 03:10:49.323
ASHLEY: Okay. So I can't Cure Wounds because I'm
not close to him, right?

03:10:49.323 --> 03:10:51.325
MATT: Exactly. You have to be right next to them.

03:10:51.325 --> 03:11:00.876
ASHLEY: Okay. So let's do that. Oh my word, I'm
shaking so bad. Okay, here we go.

03:11:00.876 --> 03:11:03.997
MATT: So go ahead and roll for the heal on that.

03:11:03.997 --> 03:11:16.939
ASHLEY: Just rolling.

03:11:16.939 --> 03:11:23.150
LIAM: You're all the way in Vasselheim!

03:11:23.150 --> 03:11:25.477
MARISHA: You're so far away.

03:11:25.477 --> 03:11:30.402
ASHLEY: 26.

03:11:30.402 --> 03:11:32.874
MATT: 26, all right. What level was that?

03:11:32.874 --> 03:11:37.876
ASHLEY: Five. Sorry, I did five.

03:11:37.876 --> 03:11:44.525
MATT: 5th-level Healing Word. All righty. That's a
bonus action. You can still do up to a 2nd-level

03:11:44.525 --> 03:11:46.436
spell as your action if you'd like.

03:11:46.436 --> 03:11:47.800
SAM: Do it!

03:11:47.800 --> 03:11:51.364
ASHLEY: Shoot. Okay, I'm not close to him.

03:11:51.364 --> 03:11:55.663
LIAM: Can you unleash some holy fire on any
fucks?

03:11:55.663 --> 03:11:59.211
LAURA: Yeah! Like a radiant blast or something?

03:11:59.211 --> 03:12:04.481
ASHLEY: Can I take my Mace of Disruption and slam
it on the ground?

03:12:04.481 --> 03:12:06.720
MATT: If you want to!

03:12:06.720 --> 03:12:11.404
ASHLEY: Oh god. Wait, how close am I to Sylas?

03:12:11.404 --> 03:12:14.719
SAM: You're 15 feet from Sylas and 15 feet from
Lady Briarwood.

03:12:14.719 --> 03:12:18.114
MATT: Well, 30 feet from Sylas and 15 feet from
Lady Briarwood.

03:12:18.114 --> 03:12:22.652
ASHLEY: Okay. You know what? Let's just do a
Sacred Flame.

03:12:22.652 --> 03:12:24.804
MATT: Sacred Flame? Okay.

03:12:24.804 --> 03:12:26.680
TALIESIN: She's 20 feet from Sylas.

03:12:26.680 --> 03:12:27.892
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:12:27.892 --> 03:12:31.727
MATT: Five, ten, 15, 20, 25, 30.

03:12:31.727 --> 03:12:34.087
ASHLEY: Sorry, guys. This totally sucks.

03:12:34.175 --> 03:12:36.946
LIAM: It's all right, it's all right. You know,
the astral plane is tricky.

03:12:37.040 --> 03:12:43.857
MATT: So dexterity saving throw. He does not make
his dexterity saving throw. 1d8 radiant damage.

03:12:43.925 --> 03:12:49.328
ASHLEY: Okay. And then can I use Scanlan's
extra?

03:12:49.413 --> 03:12:51.179
LAURA and SAM: That's only on the attack.

03:12:51.179 --> 03:12:53.270
MATT: Not for damage. So just roll 1d8.

03:12:53.270 --> 03:12:54.508
ASHLEY: Eight!

03:12:54.508 --> 03:13:04.720
MATT: All righty. Vex, you're up. You've got
Trinket right here on the steps.

03:13:04.720 --> 03:13:16.996
LAURA: I know. I am going to cast-- nobody's in a
clump anymore! They keep moving around!

03:13:16.996 --> 03:13:19.174
LIAM: That freaking wizard woman, man!

03:13:19.174 --> 03:13:24.198
LAURA: I'm going to attack Lady Briarwood with
just two attacks.

03:13:24.198 --> 03:13:27.214
LIAM: That's good! Chip her down!

03:13:27.214 --> 03:13:29.020
MATT: And you keep Trinket here by the steps?

03:13:29.020 --> 03:13:34.916
LAURA: Trinket's going to run next to Vax.

03:13:34.916 --> 03:13:40.895
MATT: Okay. All right. Yeah, you're within range.
You're fine.

03:13:40.895 --> 03:13:44.825
LAURA: Okay. And then I'm going to shoot her a
couple times.

03:13:44.825 --> 03:13:46.157
MATT: All right, go for it.

03:13:46.157 --> 03:13:50.377
LAURA. Okay. 23 for the first?

03:13:50.377 --> 03:13:55.668
MATT: Okay, because I forgot to do this on the
last attack, we're initiating now. Her image is

03:13:55.668 --> 03:13:58.865
shifting based on her location, so you have a
disadvantage on the attack roll.

03:13:58.865 --> 03:14:02.245
LAURA: Natural 20.

03:14:02.245 --> 03:14:04.255
LIAM: But the last one was good, so 23.

03:14:04.255 --> 03:14:06.370
LAURA: Yeah, the first one was a 23.

03:14:06.370 --> 03:14:07.466
MATT: 23 hits.

03:14:07.466 --> 03:14:08.985
LAURA: Natural 20 again!

03:14:08.985 --> 03:14:16.351
MATT: Okay. You do not have disadvantage. After
you hit her, the effect vanishes. That is a

03:14:16.351 --> 03:14:17.955
natural 20 against her. Go ahead and roll damage.

03:14:17.955 --> 03:14:30.236
LAURA: 17 for the first one. And then what do I
do, just double the second?

03:14:30.236 --> 03:14:35.565
MATT: Roll damage, then double the dice roll.

03:14:35.622 --> 03:14:37.698
LAURA: 19 for the second.

03:14:37.698 --> 03:14:43.345
MATT: Okay, cool. So (arrow whizzing) the arrows
both strike into her chest (pained grunt). The

03:14:43.345 --> 03:14:49.326
shimmering to her form vanishes for a second. You
can see her cloak falls limp momentarily. She

03:14:49.326 --> 03:14:51.291
looks off into the shadow and sees you floating
above.

03:14:51.291 --> 03:14:52.368
LAURA: Hide!

03:14:52.368 --> 03:14:58.733
MATT: You attempt to hide? Right now you're just
pulling in and out of the shadow? You shoot and

03:14:58.733 --> 03:15:01.344
you're going to have to try and back up even
further. Probably out of your attack range to

03:15:01.344 --> 03:15:02.264
disappear again.

03:15:02.264 --> 03:15:06.010
LAURA: Instead of backing up, can I go sideways?

03:15:06.010 --> 03:15:11.085
MATT: You can try to get over this way, but you
don't have enough movement to get there. You'd get

03:15:11.085 --> 03:15:14.289
about there and still be out in the open this
turn.

03:15:14.289 --> 03:15:15.166
LAURA: Okay.

03:15:15.166 --> 03:15:18.257
MATT: It's one of those things where you're just
out in the sky right now. Initially, when there

03:15:18.257 --> 03:15:21.574
was the overhang and they were covered in the
smoke, it was easier for you to hide in the

03:15:21.574 --> 03:15:24.596
shadow. But now you've made yourself known, you
have nothing hiding behind you and her.

03:15:24.596 --> 03:15:28.372
LAURA: Can I go below where the steps are to hide?
Behind the wall?

03:15:28.372 --> 03:15:33.556
MATT: You would be able to get right about level
this turn, and next turn you could go beneath. So

03:15:33.556 --> 03:15:35.177
you would not be able to hide as an additional
this turn.

03:15:35.177 --> 03:15:45.272
LAURA: Okay, then I want to stay high. And I'm
going to use my bonus action to cast Hunter's Mark

03:15:45.272 --> 03:15:46.370
on her.

03:15:46.370 --> 03:15:47.721
MATT: Okay!

03:15:47.721 --> 03:15:52.132
LAURA: Oh man! I should have done that at the
beginning, but I thought I was going to hide

03:15:52.132 --> 03:15:54.067
again. What a waste.

03:15:54.067 --> 03:16:00.936
MATT: All righty. So that ends your turn. Percy,
you're up. Actually, at the end of your turn,

03:16:00.936 --> 03:16:04.922
Sylas is going to use another one of his legendary
actions to make another attack on Percy.

03:16:04.922 --> 03:16:06.700
TALIESIN: God-fucking-damn it.

03:16:06.700 --> 03:16:08.506
MARISHA: How many of those fuckers does he have?

03:16:08.506 --> 03:16:09.996
MATT: Oh, he gets three every turn.

03:16:09.996 --> 03:16:11.366
MARISHA: He gets three every turn?!

03:16:11.366 --> 03:16:12.413
TRAVIS: Every round.

03:16:12.413 --> 03:16:20.635
MATT: After every round, I mean. That will be-- he
has disadvantage, so he doesn't crit. (laughs) But

03:16:20.635 --> 03:16:22.614
that is still a 30.

03:16:22.614 --> 03:16:24.964
SAM and TALIESIN: 30?!

03:16:24.964 --> 03:16:30.375
MATT: He rolled a 19 and a 20. My rolls for him
have been pretty good these past few rounds. So

03:16:30.375 --> 03:16:34.083
that's another 13 points of slashing damage
against you.

03:16:34.083 --> 03:16:35.150
TALIESIN: All right!

03:16:35.150 --> 03:16:36.333
MATT: And make a constitution saving throw.

03:16:36.333 --> 03:16:37.619
TALIESIN: And make another constitution saving
throw.

03:16:37.619 --> 03:16:39.078
MARISHA: How are you?

03:16:39.078 --> 03:16:42.107
SAM: Pike helped.

03:16:42.107 --> 03:16:44.511
TALIESIN: 13 points of damage?

03:16:44.511 --> 03:16:46.532
MATT: Yep! And then roll another constitution--

03:16:46.532 --> 03:16:49.801
TALIESIN: Saving throw. That's 18.

03:16:49.801 --> 03:16:52.877
MATT: 18? You're fine. Okay. Continue with your
turn?

03:16:52.877 --> 03:17:02.465
TALIESIN: Still, he keeps getting in my shit.
There's just no getting the fuck away from him, is

03:17:02.465 --> 03:17:09.973
there? That's fine. Well he's in the 30-foot
radius of light right now, so do my attacks have

03:17:09.973 --> 03:17:11.061
an advantage against him?

03:17:11.061 --> 03:17:13.337
MATT: No, he just has disadvantage on attack rolls
and ability checks.

03:17:13.337 --> 03:17:18.945
TALIESIN: Okay. There's just no backing away from
him right now. I'm going to have to wait for him

03:17:18.945 --> 03:17:21.135
to try and break off from me through Grog.

03:17:21.135 --> 03:17:25.016
MARISHA: He wants you. He wants your bod.

03:17:25.016 --> 03:17:31.002
TALIESIN: Yeah, I get it. So, everyone wants my
bod. I'm going to take three slashes with the

03:17:31.002 --> 03:17:33.550
sword again since I'm too close to use the
guns.

03:17:33.550 --> 03:17:35.351
MATT: Okay.

03:17:35.441 --> 03:17:38.016
TALIESIN: 25?

03:17:38.016 --> 03:17:40.394
MATT: 25? Hits.

03:17:40.394 --> 03:17:42.891
TALIESIN: 14?

03:17:42.891 --> 03:17:44.189
MATT: 14 misses.

03:17:44.189 --> 03:17:45.667
SAM: You got inspiration!

03:17:45.667 --> 03:17:48.954
TALIESIN: I know, but I don't want to waste it on
this. And 13.

03:17:48.954 --> 03:17:53.743
MATT: Only one strike hits. Twice you pierce, he's
just too fast, on one side strikes off his armor

03:17:53.827 --> 03:17:59.448
harmlessly. One strike does manage to get over the
collarbone of his armor and pierce into his chest.

03:17:59.448 --> 03:18:01.754
He goes (groan) from the pain. Go ahead and roll
damage.

03:18:01.754 --> 03:18:05.179
MARISHA: He's got more where that came from
though. He's a very inspiring person.

03:18:05.179 --> 03:18:09.814
TALIESIN: I want you to inspire other people. 12.

03:18:09.814 --> 03:18:15.622
MATT: 12 damage, all right. That ends your go.

03:18:15.622 --> 03:18:18.291
TALIESIN: Save it for a shot.

03:18:18.291 --> 03:18:33.736
MATT: Cassandra is going to-- actually, she's
going to move alongside, still staying next to

03:18:33.736 --> 03:18:37.515
Grog. And moves up with her blade out towards
you.

03:18:37.515 --> 03:18:38.784
TALIESIN: Goddamn it.

03:18:38.784 --> 03:18:54.639
MATT: Looks over at Sylas, and Sylas is nudging
with his eyes. And she looks at you. And she drops

03:18:54.639 --> 03:19:00.364
her blade for a second. And just stands there for
a second, looking at the scenario. And her turn is

03:19:00.364 --> 03:19:01.826
spent there.

03:19:01.826 --> 03:19:03.299
TALIESIN: Yeah!

03:19:03.299 --> 03:19:05.230
LAURA: She's trying! She's trying to fight it!

03:19:05.230 --> 03:19:08.866
MATT: Keyleth, you're up.

03:19:08.866 --> 03:19:11.278
MARISHA: Knock her out. Me?

03:19:11.278 --> 03:19:12.348
MATT: Yeah.

03:19:12.348 --> 03:19:14.536
MARISHA: Okay. How close am I to Sylas?

03:19:14.536 --> 03:19:17.847
MATT: You are currently 25 feet from him.

03:19:17.847 --> 03:19:33.343
MARISHA: Okay. Here's what I'm going to do. Seeing
that Sylas is distracted, I'm going to run up, and

03:19:33.343 --> 03:19:39.400
I'm going to put my hands on his back, and I'm
going to cast Sunbeam through him and try and hit

03:19:39.400 --> 03:19:41.158
Lady Briarwood as well.

03:19:41.158 --> 03:19:44.968
MATT: There is a pillar between the two of them,
so it won't go through the pillar, unfortunately.

03:19:44.968 --> 03:19:51.787
MARISHA: Then I just hug him, and I'm like,
(sings) Let the sunshine in!

03:19:51.787 --> 03:19:58.377
MARISHA, LAURA, TRAVIS, and SAM: (sing) Let the
sunshine in. The sun shine in!

03:19:58.377 --> 03:20:02.612
TALIESIN: Really? You're going to kill him with
hugs. This is the most Keyleth

03:20:02.612 --> 03:20:03.781
thing I've ever heard.

03:20:03.781 --> 03:20:06.807
MARISHA: I'm trying to do a concentrated Sunbeam.
I don't know if it's going to help.

03:20:06.807 --> 03:20:09.832
MATT: Go ahead and roll damage.

03:20:09.832 --> 03:20:13.139
MARISHA: Balls, fuck, shit. Ten.

03:20:13.139 --> 03:20:16.629
MATT: He's going to use his second legendary
action to automatically succeed the saving throw.

03:20:16.629 --> 03:20:21.074
MARISHA: 25, total.

03:20:21.074 --> 03:20:25.486
MATT: 25, okay. So that's 13. This time, as you
blast into his back you see the light burns

03:20:25.486 --> 03:20:28.929
through parts of his shoulder and chunks of his
flesh are actually blown through his armor. His

03:20:28.929 --> 03:20:33.320
armor streaks open for a second. He's like,
(pained grunt). Smoke is now sizzling up around

03:20:33.320 --> 03:20:35.965
him and he looks over his shoulder with this angry
red gaze--

03:20:35.965 --> 03:20:39.591
MARISHA: And I take my nails and dig them in a
little bit.

03:20:39.591 --> 03:20:47.177
MATT: At the end of your turn, he uses another
legendary action to then try and shove you off and

03:20:47.177 --> 03:20:53.051
arc upwards with his sword across the front of
your chest. Even with disadvantage, that's still

03:20:53.051 --> 03:20:54.223
19.

03:20:54.223 --> 03:20:55.322
MARISHA: Hits.

03:20:55.322 --> 03:21:02.718
MATT: All right. You take 16 points of slashing
damage, then make a constitution saving throw.

03:21:02.718 --> 03:21:19.467
MARISHA: Oh, wait. Hang on. Okay, has to be over
12, right? A saving throw? 17.

03:21:19.565 --> 03:21:26.919
MATT: 17? Okay, you resist the effect of the
sword. That ends your turn. Back at the top. Sylas

03:21:26.919 --> 03:21:35.655
right now is like (panting). He's looking pretty
rough. Lady Delilah runs up around the side and

03:21:35.655 --> 03:21:42.267
goes, "My love, we're not ready, but the
timetable's been pushed. We have no choice." And

03:21:42.267 --> 03:21:44.302
she wraps her arms around them and they both--

03:21:44.302 --> 03:21:48.584
SAM: I cast Counterspell as a reaction.

03:21:48.584 --> 03:21:50.710
MATT: What's the range on Counterspell?

03:21:50.710 --> 03:21:52.559
LIAM: Not again!

03:21:52.559 --> 03:21:54.676
SAM: 60 feet. Am I close enough?

03:21:54.676 --> 03:21:56.836
TRAVIS: I don't think you are.

03:21:56.836 --> 03:22:04.146
MATT: 60 feet. (counting)

03:22:04.146 --> 03:22:06.392
She is in range! All right.

03:22:06.392 --> 03:22:09.111
(cheering)

03:22:09.111 --> 03:22:16.303
SAM: I say-- shit. Do I know what she's casting?
Am I familiar with it?

03:22:16.303 --> 03:22:19.710
MATT: You're familiar with the actions about it,
so you'd have an idea, yes.

03:22:19.710 --> 03:22:21.464
SAM: Do I know what level it is?

03:22:21.464 --> 03:22:22.990
MATT: You don't know what level, no.

03:22:22.990 --> 03:22:31.621
SAM: Okay, so I'll say, (sings) Huh! That's the
sound of the gnome, fucking with your spell!

03:22:31.621 --> 03:22:36.422
Yeah. And I'll cast it at level four.

03:22:36.422 --> 03:22:43.736
MATT: At level four? All right. So I need you to
roll--

03:22:43.736 --> 03:22:45.432
SAM: Fuck, so it's higher than that.

03:22:45.432 --> 03:22:46.958
MATT: She's casting it at 5th-level.

03:22:46.958 --> 03:22:49.241
SAM: What do I roll?

03:22:49.241 --> 03:22:55.609
MATT: For this, roll a d20 and add your charisma
bonus to it. So plus five.

03:22:55.609 --> 03:22:56.992
SAM: I'm a charismatic guy.

03:22:56.992 --> 03:22:58.116
MATT: You are.

03:22:58.116 --> 03:23:00.066
SAM: 23.

03:23:00.066 --> 03:23:05.305
MATT: And with that, she grasps him. The Door
begins to open, and then flickers.

03:23:05.305 --> 03:23:07.453
(cheering)

03:23:07.453 --> 03:23:09.621
SAM: Stay.

03:23:09.621 --> 03:23:27.413
MATT: She whips around, (growls). Okay. Yeah,
that's going to end her turn. All right. With

03:23:27.413 --> 03:23:31.107
this, that ends her turn. Scanlan, you're up.

03:23:31.107 --> 03:23:39.017
SAM: Grog? I hold my turn.

03:23:39.017 --> 03:23:41.139
MATT: Okay.

03:23:41.139 --> 03:23:51.642
SAM: I'm sorry, I hold my action and my movement.
And instead I will inspire Grog with a little

03:23:51.642 --> 03:23:57.770
harmonica ditty. (harmonica)

03:23:57.770 --> 03:23:59.147
TALIESIN: Jaunty!

03:23:59.147 --> 03:24:01.160
MATT: Okay. All righty.

03:24:01.160 --> 03:24:03.892
SAM: Oh, is it his turn now, next?

03:24:03.892 --> 03:24:07.215
MATT: No, it is not. You hold the rest of your
turn?

03:24:07.215 --> 03:24:08.121
SAM: I hold.

03:24:08.121 --> 03:24:12.731
MATT: All right. Vax. Still left there, staring
into space.

03:24:12.731 --> 03:24:14.362
LIAM: Constitution save at this point?

03:24:14.362 --> 03:24:16.417
MATT: This would be a constitution saving throw
again, yeah.

03:24:16.417 --> 03:24:18.836
LAURA: If only Scanlan had inspired you.

03:24:18.836 --> 03:24:20.820
LIAM: If only. No.

03:24:20.820 --> 03:24:25.614
MATT: Still left there. Useless. Staring in the
distance.

03:24:25.614 --> 03:24:28.653
LIAM: Thinking of IKEA instructions.

03:24:28.653 --> 03:24:33.346
LAURA: Well, I thought Trinket would be able to
help you, but you're not doing anything.

03:24:33.346 --> 03:24:35.032
MATT: Grog, now you're up.

03:24:35.032 --> 03:24:37.057
TRAVIS: So for the Boots of Levitation--

03:24:37.057 --> 03:24:38.406
MATT: Actually, before that happens.

03:24:38.406 --> 03:24:39.740
TALIESIN: Goddamn it.

03:24:39.740 --> 03:24:44.485
MATT: At the end of your turn, he's going to use
his third legendary action in this round to,

03:24:44.485 --> 03:24:48.365
without any attacks of opportunity, move.

03:24:48.365 --> 03:24:56.845
TRAVIS: Is that Lord Briarwood?

03:24:56.845 --> 03:25:04.275
MATT: Yes. He pulls away, still trying to get out
of the range of the sunlight.

03:25:04.275 --> 03:25:12.587
TRAVIS: Okay. The Boots of Levitation. It says it
requires an action to levitate?

03:25:12.587 --> 03:25:13.578
MATT: Correct.

03:25:13.578 --> 03:25:16.826
TRAVIS: Could I do three attacks? Or just two, and
then have the action left over?

03:25:16.826 --> 03:25:19.930
MATT: You could action and then you'd have your
one bonus strike as a frenzied rage.

03:25:19.930 --> 03:25:25.857
SAM: Can you put on the boots as a bonus action?

03:25:25.857 --> 03:25:28.178
TRAVIS: I'm already wearing them.

03:25:28.178 --> 03:25:29.798
LAURA: Just set it up.

03:25:29.798 --> 03:25:32.944
TRAVIS: Set it up?

03:25:32.944 --> 03:25:35.078
LAURA: You could do it on this move. Then on the
next move--

03:25:35.078 --> 03:25:36.386
SAM: It's too long.

03:25:36.386 --> 03:25:40.628
TRAVIS: Yeah, fuck it. I'll take all three strikes
at Lady Briarwood.

03:25:40.628 --> 03:25:47.074
MATT: Okay! So you move in, to there. Go ahead and
make your attacks.

03:25:47.074 --> 03:25:49.698
TRAVIS: That's good. 25?

03:25:49.698 --> 03:25:53.949
MATT: You have disadvantage on these strikes, as
her cloak has now kicked back in.

03:25:53.949 --> 03:25:56.196
TRAVIS: 17?

03:25:56.196 --> 03:26:02.556
MATT: 17 misses. First blow passes through her
form harmlessly.

03:26:02.556 --> 03:26:04.200
SAM: You're inspired!

03:26:04.200 --> 03:26:06.892
TRAVIS: I'll use that inspiration on that one. No,
not on that one.

03:26:06.892 --> 03:26:10.110
MATT: So the first one missed, the second one
missed?

03:26:10.110 --> 03:26:13.368
TRAVIS: The first and the second one missed.

03:26:13.368 --> 03:26:16.137
MATT: The first strike, with disadvantage.

03:26:16.137 --> 03:26:25.210
TRAVIS: Jesus Christ. 20.

03:26:25.210 --> 03:26:33.560
MATT: 20 hits. As this one actually finds purchase
on her torso, the shimmering effect vanishes once

03:26:33.560 --> 03:26:35.704
again, the cloak falling limp to her side.

03:26:35.704 --> 03:26:38.127
TRAVIS: 19.

03:26:38.127 --> 03:26:45.671
MATT: 19. Okay. The hammer slams into the front of
her chest, and she goes, (panting).

03:26:45.671 --> 03:26:50.526
She's starting to get almost feral in her
frustration.

03:26:50.526 --> 03:26:53.689
MARISHA: Feral?

03:26:53.689 --> 03:26:56.284
MATT: (growls) She's angry.

03:26:56.284 --> 03:26:57.313
MARISHA: Okay.

03:26:57.313 --> 03:27:07.534
SAM: I will take my move now. And I will (singing)
Bigby's Hand! (speaking) And I will raise up the

03:27:07.534 --> 03:27:11.559
hand somewhere between Sylas and Lady.

03:27:11.559 --> 03:27:19.009
(cheering)

03:27:19.009 --> 03:27:21.250
MARISHA: Look at that sexy hand!

03:27:21.250 --> 03:27:23.325
SAM: Mister is injured, right?

03:27:23.325 --> 03:27:25.246
LIAM: He's looking rough!

03:27:25.246 --> 03:27:29.462
SAM: And she is not flickering anymore, so I can
get a good hit on her, as well?

03:27:29.462 --> 03:27:32.394
MATT: Correct. Yeah, the disadvantage on attacks
against her has faded.

03:27:32.394 --> 03:27:37.460
SAM: I will go on her. I don't like her, so I'll
punch her in the face.

03:27:37.460 --> 03:27:43.842
MATT: Okay! Goes forward. Go ahead and roll for
your spell attack against her.

03:27:43.842 --> 03:27:47.391
SAM: Oh, okay. Is this through the cone?

03:27:47.391 --> 03:27:52.399
MATT: There isn't a cone aspect to it.

03:27:52.399 --> 03:27:54.980
SAM: Oh, so do I just roll to hit?

03:27:54.980 --> 03:27:59.208
MATT: Here you go, I'll pull it up right here. All
right, this is the clenched fist? You make a melee

03:27:59.208 --> 03:28:01.270
spell attack. Roll a d20 and add your spell attack
bonus.

03:28:01.270 --> 03:28:07.329
SAM: Okay. (giggles) Spell attack. 16?

03:28:07.329 --> 03:28:12.395
MATT: 16. As the fist (whoosh) towards her, she
ducks and it slams into the pillar, cracking the

03:28:12.395 --> 03:28:14.205
stone slightly.

03:28:14.205 --> 03:28:20.654
SAM: Shit. How far away am I from both of them?

03:28:20.654 --> 03:28:28.206
MATT: From both of them? You are about 45 feet
from Sylas and about 65 feet from her.

03:28:28.206 --> 03:28:32.939
SAM: I get ten feet closer to her.

03:28:32.939 --> 03:28:35.264
LAURA: (quietly) Can you inspire Vax?

03:28:35.264 --> 03:28:39.680
SAM: This is the rest of my turn. I already used
it to inspire Grog.

03:28:39.680 --> 03:28:49.007
MATT: All right, so that's the end of Grog's turn?
All right. It is now Sylas's turn. Sylas is going

03:28:49.007 --> 03:28:56.126
to step off to the side here, stepping off to the
stairs to get out of the range of the sunlight.

03:28:56.126 --> 03:29:01.573
Just outside of the radius of it. And, glancing
over at you, after you just unleashed that swing

03:29:01.573 --> 03:29:08.807
of attacks towards his wife, he goes, "You. Help
us." Make a wisdom saving throw with advantage.

03:29:08.807 --> 03:29:10.140
TRAVIS: With advantage?

03:29:10.140 --> 03:29:11.448
MATT: With advantage.

03:29:11.448 --> 03:29:13.132
LIAM: Roll. High.

03:29:13.132 --> 03:29:15.535
MARISHA: Roll like you're Percy!

03:29:15.535 --> 03:29:18.700
MATT: What did you roll?

03:29:18.700 --> 03:29:21.882
TRAVIS: A four.

03:29:21.882 --> 03:29:23.850
MATT: With advantage?

03:29:23.850 --> 03:29:25.140
TRAVIS: Yeah.

03:29:25.140 --> 03:29:30.938
MATT: Wow. With that, Grog, now you realize you've
been on the wrong side of this battlefield the

03:29:30.938 --> 03:29:36.615
whole time. And your allies are being assaulted by
individuals that claim to be your friends but

03:29:36.690 --> 03:29:42.166
might be completely against this whole
circumstance. Your allegiance switches for now to

03:29:42.166 --> 03:29:49.048
defend them at all costs. That's going to end his
turn. Pike!

03:29:49.048 --> 03:29:53.821
TRAVIS: Wait. I'm raging. Can I be charmed?

03:29:53.821 --> 03:29:57.535
(cheering)

03:29:57.535 --> 03:30:06.524
MATT: That's a good notification to make. The
charm effect hits your mind. This is why you read

03:30:06.524 --> 03:30:09.954
your abilities, guys. I don't remember all the
details.

03:30:09.954 --> 03:30:12.307
SAM: Best question of the night!

03:30:12.307 --> 03:30:14.952
LIAM: Oh my god!

03:30:14.952 --> 03:30:17.770
TRAVIS: Intelligence of six. It takes a second!

03:30:17.770 --> 03:30:24.945
MATT: As you see this look, you feel the influence
begin to pry. But it isn't enough to push through

03:30:24.945 --> 03:30:26.686
the red and blazing anger--

03:30:26.686 --> 03:30:28.254
TALIESIN: Yeah!

03:30:28.254 --> 03:30:32.145
LIAM: That was the thin red line, Travis.

03:30:32.145 --> 03:30:40.498
MATT: With that, you see the expression of intent
and some worry on Sylas's face, ending his turn.

03:30:40.498 --> 03:30:42.005
Pike, what are you doing?

03:30:42.005 --> 03:30:51.201
ASHLEY: My turn? Okay, so I would like to Channel
Divinity and Destroy Undead?

03:30:51.201 --> 03:30:52.377
MARISHA: Yes!

03:30:52.377 --> 03:30:54.735
SAM: This is what we hired you for!

03:30:54.735 --> 03:31:02.119
MATT: Just as a heads up, Destroy Undead, for the
most part, is only effective against lower-level

03:31:02.214 --> 03:31:07.977
undead. Knowing that Sylas is a vampire, it might
not have the desired effect that you're thinking

03:31:07.977 --> 03:31:09.214
it might.

03:31:09.214 --> 03:31:10.121
ASHLEY: Okay.

03:31:10.121 --> 03:31:16.056
MATT: Just as a heads up. You can still Turn
Undead and it may make him afraid of you.

03:31:16.056 --> 03:31:18.187
But that is--

03:31:18.187 --> 03:31:19.579
ASHLEY: Let's give it a try!

03:31:19.579 --> 03:31:20.854
TRAVIS: I like it!

03:31:20.854 --> 03:31:22.925
MATT: All right. We're bringing this up here real
fast.

03:31:22.925 --> 03:31:24.970
ASHLEY: How close am I to him?

03:31:24.970 --> 03:31:26.125
LAURA: Pretty close.

03:31:26.125 --> 03:31:28.152
LIAM: Pretty close. 20 feet.

03:31:28.152 --> 03:31:34.450
ASHLEY: You know what, I feel like I want to hit
him with my Mace of Disruption.

03:31:34.450 --> 03:31:35.844
MATT: If you want to!

03:31:35.844 --> 03:31:37.810
LIAM: He's rough.

03:31:37.810 --> 03:31:44.530
MATT: So instead you run up, charging towards him,
shield up in front of you. Pike, her blazing

03:31:44.530 --> 03:31:49.188
radiant form, the energy rippling off from behind
her. You pull back your mace, and as it swings

03:31:49.188 --> 03:31:54.080
through the air, a quick flicker of angelic wings
appear at your back as your mace swings down

03:31:54.080 --> 03:31:55.745
towards him. Go ahead and roll your attack.

03:31:55.745 --> 03:32:05.916
ASHLEY: Come on. Okay, 16. But I'm going to use
War God's Blessing and add ten.

03:32:05.916 --> 03:32:07.328
MATT: Yes, you can do that.

03:32:07.328 --> 03:32:10.205
TRAVIS: War God's Blessing?

03:32:10.205 --> 03:32:14.832
MATT: Okay. War God's Blessing.

03:32:14.832 --> 03:32:18.574
TRAVIS: She has inspiration from you too, right?

03:32:18.574 --> 03:32:21.382
SAM: But has she rolled yet?

03:32:21.382 --> 03:32:24.655
MATT: Yep, when any creature within 30 feet makes
an attack roll you can use your reaction to grant

03:32:24.655 --> 03:32:36.812
that creature-- usually it's against other
creatures. Okay. War God's Blessing you can only

03:32:36.812 --> 03:32:41.403
use on other creatures, but you do have Channel
Divinity: Guided Strike, which you can use on

03:32:41.403 --> 03:32:45.145
yourself. It's essentially the same thing. You
give yourself plus ten bonus to the roll.

03:32:45.145 --> 03:32:46.506
ASHLEY: Okay.

03:32:46.506 --> 03:32:48.647
MATT: So you use your Channel Divinity: Guided
Strike instead?

03:32:48.647 --> 03:32:49.663
ASHLEY: Got it.

03:32:49.663 --> 03:32:52.068
MATT: Okay. So that would bring you to 26? That
would hit.

03:32:52.068 --> 03:32:53.114
ASHLEY: Okay.

03:32:53.114 --> 03:33:01.232
MATT: Okay. All right, so you slam down onto Sylas
with your Mace of Disruption. Go ahead and roll

03:33:01.232 --> 03:33:03.227
damage on that. He is considered an undead.

03:33:03.227 --> 03:33:04.374
LAURA: Kill him!

03:33:04.374 --> 03:33:05.516
LIAM: A thousand pieces.

03:33:05.516 --> 03:33:07.474
ASHLEY: How many times do I roll?

03:33:07.474 --> 03:33:12.064
MATT: Well you roll your damage, and it does an
additional 2d6 radiant damage.

03:33:12.064 --> 03:33:13.460
TALIESIN: Damn!

03:33:13.460 --> 03:33:16.792
LIAM: The mace damage--

03:33:16.792 --> 03:33:20.350
ASHLEY: Okay, got it. Sorry guys, sorry. I'm
back.

03:33:20.350 --> 03:33:29.811
LIAM: Break into a million pieces.

03:33:29.811 --> 03:33:34.302
LAURA: I love you, too. Your headset looks really
pretty!

03:33:34.302 --> 03:33:35.974
ASHLEY: Thanks!

03:33:35.974 --> 03:33:41.559
TALIESIN: It's like looking at the Technicolor
logo.

03:33:41.559 --> 03:33:44.564
TRAVIS: Everybody get their heads down, like
Ashley.

03:33:44.564 --> 03:33:45.974
ASHLEY: Okay, 21!

03:33:46.045 --> 03:33:47.476
MATT: 21 points of damage?

03:33:47.476 --> 03:33:48.690
ASHLEY: Yeah.

03:33:48.690 --> 03:33:54.962
MATT: Okay, as per the effect of the spell, he now
has to make a wisdom saving throw, which he does

03:33:54.962 --> 03:34:00.751
succeed. If he failed, he would have been
destroyed. However, on a success, he is still

03:34:00.751 --> 03:34:06.910
afraid of you. So he is now considered afraid of
Pike. Disadvantage on all attack rolls.

03:34:06.910 --> 03:34:10.154
TRAVIS: Fuck yeah, he is! Let them know, Pike!

03:34:10.154 --> 03:34:14.809
MATT: Until the end of your next turn. Awesome,
Pike! Anything else you want to do on your turn,

03:34:14.809 --> 03:34:16.207
or is that it?

03:34:16.207 --> 03:34:21.407
ASHLEY: I would love to go up to Vax, but I don't
think I can, right?

03:34:21.407 --> 03:34:22.532
MATT: No.

03:34:22.532 --> 03:34:25.754
ASHLEY: Okay. Then I'll stay, I'll stay.

03:34:25.754 --> 03:34:28.416
MATT: Okay, that ends your turn Pike. Vex, you're
up.

03:34:28.416 --> 03:34:30.208
LAURA: Awesome, I'm going to shoot him.

03:34:30.208 --> 03:34:31.581
MATT: You're going to shoot Sylas?

03:34:31.581 --> 03:34:33.001
LAURA: Yeah, with holy arrows.

03:34:33.001 --> 03:34:37.208
MATT: Okay.

03:34:37.208 --> 03:34:41.094
LAURA: That does not hit him. Come on. 19?

03:34:41.094 --> 03:34:44.701
MATT: 19 hits. Just barely.

03:34:44.701 --> 03:34:52.442
LAURA: 17, plus two holy damage.

03:34:52.442 --> 03:34:54.910
MATT: So the first attack missed?

03:34:54.910 --> 03:34:55.915
LAURA: Yeah.

03:34:55.915 --> 03:34:56.972
MATT: And the second one hit?

03:34:56.972 --> 03:34:58.029
LAURA: Yeah. 19.

03:34:58.029 --> 03:35:02.340
MATT: 19 damage, all right. As the arrows (thud,
thud), one hits the armor and streaks off and

03:35:02.340 --> 03:35:07.117
shatters against the green glass stonework of the
top of the ziggurat. The second one strikes him in

03:35:07.117 --> 03:35:11.448
the back of the neck. You see a blast of radiant
energy crosses his throat. He reaches up and tries

03:35:11.448 --> 03:35:16.100
to grab for the arrow, but the arrow itself is
disintegrated by the blast of holy energy, leaving

03:35:16.100 --> 03:35:21.444
a gaping wound in the back of his neck. He's still
standing, but you can see his form is now falling

03:35:21.444 --> 03:35:26.300
apart. Parts of ash are beginning to pour off his
flesh. He's looking really rough.

03:35:26.300 --> 03:35:32.427
All right. That finishes Vex's turn. Unless you
want to move? Stay where you are?

03:35:32.427 --> 03:35:40.232
LAURA: I'm afraid my flying potion's going to
start to wear off soon, so I'm going to move. Is

03:35:40.232 --> 03:35:43.608
there a roof? On that middle compound building?

03:35:43.608 --> 03:35:45.509
MATT: From what you can see, no. It is open.

03:35:45.589 --> 03:35:46.357
LAURA: Oh, really?

03:35:46.357 --> 03:35:47.205
MATT: Yeah.

03:35:47.205 --> 03:35:48.811
LAURA: Can I land on top of the pillar?

03:35:48.811 --> 03:35:51.050
MATT: The pillar holds a slight overhang, so you
can land on top of the overhang if you want.

03:35:51.050 --> 03:35:52.012
LAURA: Yeah!

03:35:52.012 --> 03:35:56.208
MATT: All right, so you land on top of the
overhang, stopping there. Which blocks all view

03:35:56.208 --> 03:35:58.028
from beneath this line, there, but--

03:35:58.028 --> 03:35:59.184
LAURA: But I can still see--

03:35:59.184 --> 03:36:00.486
MATT: You could peek around if you want.

03:36:00.486 --> 03:36:01.432
LAURA: Yeah, okay.

03:36:01.432 --> 03:36:02.781
MATT: Okay. Percy, you're up.

03:36:02.781 --> 03:36:13.689
TALIESIN: Okay. First thing I'm going to do is I'm
going to pull out the Pepperbox. And I'm going to

03:36:13.689 --> 03:36:17.397
take a shot at Sylas, and I'm going to get him to
drop his sword.

03:36:17.397 --> 03:36:19.471
MATT: Okay.

03:36:19.471 --> 03:36:24.513
TALIESIN: So, let's see.

03:36:24.513 --> 03:36:25.742
SAM: You're not going to kill him?

03:36:25.742 --> 03:36:29.041
TALIESIN: Nope! Not yet. Just in case things go
bad-- and I also just want to make sure-- that's a

03:36:29.041 --> 03:36:30.405
26?

03:36:30.405 --> 03:36:37.517
MATT: Hits. No damage, but he drops his weapon?

03:36:37.517 --> 03:36:38.645
TALIESIN: But he drops his weapon.

03:36:38.645 --> 03:36:43.014
MATT: So with that, (bullet impact) the blade he
was holding clatters to the ground before him, the

03:36:43.014 --> 03:36:46.054
onyx blade shining in what low light there is
around this temple.

03:36:46.054 --> 03:36:54.059
TALIESIN: Now I'm going to take a shot at him.
That's a 29.

03:36:54.059 --> 03:36:55.403
MATT: Hits.

03:36:55.403 --> 03:37:06.740
TALIESIN: That does... ten points of damage?

03:37:06.740 --> 03:37:14.925
MATT: Ten points of damage? As that bullet hits
him (soft impact) you see he begins to dissipate.

03:37:14.925 --> 03:37:25.279
And then turns into a mist form in the space where
he is. He is currently now a form of mist.

03:37:25.279 --> 03:37:28.835
LAURA: So he can go heal himself unless we can get
him.

03:37:28.835 --> 03:37:40.985
TALIESIN: She's going to take care of this. How
close am I to Lady Briarwood?

03:37:40.985 --> 03:37:42.526
MATT: You're ten feet from her.

03:37:42.526 --> 03:37:56.903
TALIESIN: Ten feet? That's close enough, I guess.
I'm going to take a couple of steps back, and I'm

03:37:56.903 --> 03:38:02.535
going to do a fire shot and an ice shot with my
last two shots.

03:38:02.535 --> 03:38:04.655
MATT: Well, you've already done two shots.

03:38:04.655 --> 03:38:12.097
TALIESIN: Oh, yeah. I'll fire shot with my next
shot. Does she currently have advantage or no?

03:38:12.097 --> 03:38:14.082
MATT: No, because it has not come back to her.

03:38:14.082 --> 03:38:16.098
TALIESIN: Okay, so I'm going to also put
sharpshooter on that.

03:38:16.098 --> 03:38:17.530
MATT: Okay.

03:38:17.530 --> 03:38:23.146
TALIESIN: Yay. (counting) 26 to hit?

03:38:23.146 --> 03:38:24.194
MATT: That hits.

03:38:24.194 --> 03:38:32.121
TALIESIN: So that's-- plus--

03:38:32.121 --> 03:38:35.069
SAM: Is that her right there? No that's
Cassandra.

03:38:35.069 --> 03:38:36.983
MATT: That's Cassandra. That's Briarwood, right
there.

03:38:36.983 --> 03:38:53.599
TALIESIN: Oh, and plus the Hex! So that's
(counting) 24 points of damage plus two points of

03:38:53.599 --> 03:38:54.709
fire damage.

03:38:54.709 --> 03:39:00.423
MATT: Whew, nice. The shot (bang) blasts into the
side of her face. You can see part of her jawbone

03:39:00.423 --> 03:39:06.826
is cracked as part of this, and her ear is blown
off to one side of her face, (choked groan) and

03:39:06.826 --> 03:39:08.993
she cradles it to her side as (grunts).

03:39:08.993 --> 03:39:10.519
LAURA: Like a ketchup packet!

03:39:10.519 --> 03:39:12.865
TALIESIN: Let's spend an action surge and keep
enjoying this!

03:39:12.865 --> 03:39:14.915
LIAM: Our cleric giggles from Vasselheim.

03:39:14.915 --> 03:39:18.689
TALIESIN: Why don't we take a--

03:39:18.689 --> 03:39:23.890
LIAM: If there's a time to blow your wad, it's
now.

03:39:23.890 --> 03:39:32.958
TALIESIN: Yeah, let's take a... violent shot on
top of that.

03:39:32.958 --> 03:39:34.247
LAURA: Violent shot?

03:39:34.247 --> 03:39:42.773
TALIESIN: I use the violent shot action with the
ice damage. Let's see what that does. Natural 20!

03:39:42.773 --> 03:39:45.281
This is going to be ugly as fuck.

03:39:45.281 --> 03:39:48.448
TRAVIS: (laughing) Of course it is!

03:39:48.448 --> 03:39:50.958
MARISHA: Of course.

03:39:50.958 --> 03:39:54.862
MATT: And this is all piercing damage, right?

03:39:54.862 --> 03:40:03.456
TALIESIN: Oh my god. This is so fucking bad, is
what this is about to be. Oh my god, this is going

03:40:03.456 --> 03:40:15.608
to be so-- let me get these additional dice. Okay,
so let's start doing this. Do all of the dice

03:40:15.608 --> 03:40:17.224
rolls get doubled?

03:40:17.224 --> 03:40:19.598
MATT: All of the dice for this roll.

03:40:19.598 --> 03:40:21.579
TALIESIN: All of the dice for this roll. Oh boy.

03:40:21.579 --> 03:40:23.430
MATT: Roll the dice and then double it.

03:40:23.430 --> 03:40:24.462
TALIESIN: Okay.

03:40:24.462 --> 03:40:33.232
MARISHA: High rolls. Big money, no whammies. It
could be worse.

03:40:33.232 --> 03:40:46.826
TALIESIN: (counts quietly) 42 points of damage
plus eight points of ice damage.

03:40:46.826 --> 03:40:56.914
MATT: Okay. This blast hits her in the side of the
shoulder, and the cloak catches fire for a moment

03:40:56.914 --> 03:41:00.971
before dispersing, and you can see the impact.
There's blood now seeping into her robe. She's

03:41:00.971 --> 03:41:06.242
looking rough, but you've noticed with each of
these shots, the impact you're used to doing with

03:41:06.242 --> 03:41:10.557
these shots is not doing the full impact you would
expect, especially with the force of these blows.

03:41:10.557 --> 03:41:16.674
Every shot you've taken on her in particular. That
ends your turn?

03:41:16.674 --> 03:41:25.112
TALIESIN: No, I've still got two more shots.
Actually, I get my grit point back from that

03:41:25.112 --> 03:41:28.846
because that was a natural 20, so that was a free
shot.

03:41:28.846 --> 03:41:32.243
MATT: When do you reload, by the way?

03:41:32.243 --> 03:41:37.150
TALIESIN: I have two more shots, and then I have
to reload. I'm keeping track. I'm being good.

03:41:37.150 --> 03:41:49.409
Let's hit her in the legs.

03:41:49.409 --> 03:41:51.496
MATT: Okay.

03:41:51.496 --> 03:41:59.410
TALIESIN: That's 20 to hit?

03:41:59.410 --> 03:42:04.549
MATT: 20 to hit. This is with your minus five? Are
you taking a sharpshooter shot on this?

03:42:04.549 --> 03:42:06.033
TALIESIN: Yeah. 20 to hit?

03:42:06.033 --> 03:42:08.054
MATT: You rolled a what?

03:42:08.054 --> 03:42:10.281
TALIESIN: No, 20 total to hit.

03:42:10.281 --> 03:42:11.868
MATT: Right. Okay.

03:42:11.868 --> 03:42:13.372
TALIESIN: I rolled a 13.

03:42:13.372 --> 03:42:15.376
MATT: Yeah. Okay, so that does hit, yes.

03:42:15.376 --> 03:42:24.707
TALIESIN: Because she has her disadvantage. She
needs to make a constitution saving throw.

03:42:24.707 --> 03:42:27.012
MATT: 22?

03:42:27.012 --> 03:42:31.970
TALIESIN: DC equals eight plus my proficiency mod
plus my dexterity mod.

03:42:31.970 --> 03:42:35.039
MATT: Plus ten, so 18.

03:42:35.039 --> 03:42:39.023
TALIESIN: She made it. She didn't fall, but she
still takes some damage, so let's see what she

03:42:39.023 --> 03:42:50.833
does. Ten, 12, 22, 28 points of damage.

03:42:50.833 --> 03:42:52.216
MATT: All righty.

03:42:52.216 --> 03:43:02.612
TALIESIN: And because this is really annoying me,
I'm going to give her a gut shot. Torso shot. Same

03:43:02.612 --> 03:43:04.512
thing, sharpshooter.

03:43:04.512 --> 03:43:07.417
LIAM: I'm seeing this all in slow motion.

03:43:07.417 --> 03:43:12.649
MARISHA: Throwing bullets.

03:43:12.649 --> 03:43:27.532
TALIESIN: 27 points of damage. And she has a
disadvantage on strength and dexterity checks for

03:43:27.532 --> 03:43:29.612
the rest of the round. For one full round.

03:43:29.612 --> 03:43:31.039
MATT: Good to know.

03:43:31.039 --> 03:43:34.622
TALIESIN: I'm going to back up a little bit, for
the rest of my--

03:43:34.622 --> 03:43:35.800
MATT: Over here?

03:43:35.800 --> 03:43:37.026
TALIESIN: Yeah, that way.

03:43:37.026 --> 03:43:38.971
LAURA: Get out of her view?

03:43:38.971 --> 03:43:42.387
MATT: Sure. That ends your turn, Percy?

03:43:42.387 --> 03:43:44.285
TALIESIN: (laughs) Yeah.

03:43:44.285 --> 03:43:51.191
MATT: Cassandra, seeing all this go down and
having this crisis moment, picks up her sword,

03:43:51.191 --> 03:44:02.405
rushes over, and uses her action to pull out one
of the potions that you gave her, the greater

03:44:02.405 --> 03:44:07.187
healing potion, and feed it to the ailing
Briarwood.

03:44:07.187 --> 03:44:08.494
TALIESIN: Damn it, girl!

03:44:08.494 --> 03:44:11.971
SAM: I gave her one. I gave her a greater.

03:44:11.971 --> 03:44:14.778
LAURA: A greater? We wasted a greater?!

03:44:14.778 --> 03:44:21.867
SAM: I'm a nice guy! I can't resist the charm of a
woman, especially one who looks identical to you.

03:44:21.867 --> 03:44:28.006
MATT: Her wounds close up a little bit. The ear
wound heals over a little bit, and she wipes her

03:44:28.006 --> 03:44:32.401
mouth. "Thank you, dear. Sylas! To the ritual!"

03:44:32.401 --> 03:44:35.177
LAURA: He's a mist.

03:44:35.177 --> 03:44:37.788
MATT: Keyleth, it's your turn.

03:44:37.788 --> 03:44:40.398
TALIESIN: Do it. Do it, girl!

03:44:40.398 --> 03:44:41.660
LIAM: Burn him.

03:44:41.660 --> 03:44:46.201
MARISHA: Okay, so I turn and I start shouting to
the mist and I say, what's the matter, Sylas?

03:44:46.201 --> 03:44:52.685
Afraid of a little gnome and a druid? And I blast
him with Sunbeam.

03:44:52.685 --> 03:44:53.777
TRAVIS: Good line.

03:44:53.777 --> 03:44:55.231
LAURA: (laughing) That was the lamest thing.

03:44:55.231 --> 03:45:00.701
MARISHA: Thanks! I'm not good with lines.
Keyleth isn't good with lines. Are you afraid of

03:45:00.701 --> 03:45:04.916
us? I heard Percy try to do lines, and I'm like,
that's what badasses do.

03:45:04.916 --> 03:45:12.410
MATT: I guess in this particular instance I want
to ask you:

03:45:12.410 --> 03:45:13.718
How do you want to do this?

03:45:13.718 --> 03:45:19.908
(cheering)

03:45:19.908 --> 03:45:21.432
LIAM: Sorry, cursed gun!

03:45:21.432 --> 03:45:29.047
MATT: There's still a semi-visible form of his
body, but in a mist form. It's trying to slowly

03:45:29.047 --> 03:45:31.536
escape off the top of this structure.

03:45:31.536 --> 03:45:33.234
MARISHA: Okay. Pike is standing right next to
him?

03:45:33.234 --> 03:45:34.225
MATT: Correct.

03:45:34.225 --> 03:45:42.659
MARISHA: I'm going to use Pike and use the light
that I have off Pike and combine it to do a joint

03:45:42.659 --> 03:45:49.466
Sunbeam, holy bomb.

03:45:49.466 --> 03:45:50.334
MATT: Okay.

03:45:50.334 --> 03:45:51.768
MARISHA: Boom.

03:45:51.768 --> 03:45:52.492
MATT: Great.

03:45:52.492 --> 03:45:58.500
LIAM: He's going to eat a bag of holy dicks is
what you're saying, right?

03:45:58.583 --> 03:46:02.657
MARISHA: Yeah, I want him to eat a bag of holy
dicks. Now explain that, please.

03:46:02.657 --> 03:46:04.937
Make it sound great.

03:46:04.937 --> 03:46:12.401
MATT: So. Looking over at Pike, already ready with
her mace up in the air and the mist recoiling from

03:46:12.401 --> 03:46:16.936
her. You glance at each other, have that
connective point, and as Pike brings up her

03:46:16.936 --> 03:46:22.538
shield, you bring back your Sunbeam and throw it
towards the shield, arcing it in his direction as

03:46:22.538 --> 03:46:26.844
she ricochets the reflection of the actual
sunlight back at him at the same time.

03:46:26.844 --> 03:46:28.452
LAURA: That was way cooler than what you said.

03:46:28.452 --> 03:46:30.655
MARISHA: Yeah, way cooler! I knew he'd bring it
through.

03:46:30.655 --> 03:46:35.782
MATT: As it sprays across, the beams themselves
seem to form nearly phallic rays.

03:46:35.782 --> 03:46:40.862
(laughter)

03:46:40.862 --> 03:46:44.906
MATT: Tearing through the mist, and with an
echoing scream, you hear Sylas's voice ring out,

03:46:44.906 --> 03:46:50.936
(screams) as the mist is immediately dissipated
and disintegrated and his form is no more.

03:46:50.936 --> 03:46:56.084
(cheering)

03:46:56.084 --> 03:46:58.324
MARISHA: High five, Pike!

03:46:58.324 --> 03:47:02.629
LAURA: How does it feel, Lady Briarwood?

03:47:02.629 --> 03:47:08.798
MATT: She, looking over her shoulder, still
looking at him as she's called to him to go join

03:47:08.798 --> 03:47:14.246
in the altar room, the ritual room, looks over and
sees his mist form. In slow motion, from her

03:47:14.246 --> 03:47:20.921
perspective, she sees Keyleth step forward, wind
blowing around her, releasing this beam and

03:47:20.921 --> 03:47:29.183
watching him be disintegrated. Immediately, her
eyes open wide and she screams out, "No! Sylas!"

03:47:29.183 --> 03:47:35.722
and you can see her whole body shaking now. The
horror of seeing her partner, the love of her

03:47:35.722 --> 03:47:43.086
life, disintegrated before her. Tears immediately
burst down her face, and her hands are shaking

03:47:43.086 --> 03:47:50.328
there as she screams out, "You can't! I broke the
world for us! No."

03:47:50.328 --> 03:47:52.594
That's the end of your turn?

03:47:52.594 --> 03:47:54.695
LIAM: May I ask a question?

03:47:54.695 --> 03:47:55.742
MATT: Yes.

03:47:55.742 --> 03:47:58.815
LIAM: Does Cassandra's charm come from Sylas or
Lady Briarwood?

03:47:58.815 --> 03:48:04.313
MATT: At this point, you have no idea.

03:48:04.313 --> 03:48:06.077
LAURA: What about yours?

03:48:06.077 --> 03:48:08.018
LIAM: From Lady Briarwood, yeah.

03:48:08.018 --> 03:48:09.174
SAM: The lady.

03:48:09.174 --> 03:48:10.286
LAURA: The lady.

03:48:10.286 --> 03:48:14.114
MATT: Yours is fine. All right, does that end your
turn, Keyleth?

03:48:14.114 --> 03:48:17.407
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:48:17.407 --> 03:48:25.490
MATT: All righty. So, with that, it brings us to
the top of the initiative round. It is now Lady

03:48:25.490 --> 03:48:36.310
Delilah Briarwood's turn. Looking around, heaving
with anger and frustration, she looks around her

03:48:36.310 --> 03:48:40.959
area and the tears streak down her face, blood
streaking down one side of her head. She looks at

03:48:40.959 --> 03:48:47.668
Cassandra, who right now is faltering. Seeing
everything closing around her, she goes, "It's too

03:48:47.668 --> 03:48:55.732
"soon, but it's our only chance." And with that,
she is going to step around here.

03:48:55.732 --> 03:48:58.871
LIAM: Somebody hit her. Hit her!

03:48:58.871 --> 03:49:01.850
MATT: She's still in combat with you, so you don't
get an attack of opportunity. Keyleth, you do, if

03:49:01.850 --> 03:49:03.743
you want to try and swing towards her.

03:49:03.743 --> 03:49:05.593
MARISHA: Can I use my sunlight that I have up?

03:49:05.593 --> 03:49:07.376
MATT: No, you have to make a combat strike.

03:49:07.376 --> 03:49:08.410
MARISHA: My staff?

03:49:08.410 --> 03:49:09.378
LAURA: Trip her!

03:49:09.378 --> 03:49:10.829
MARISHA: Can I go for a trip?

03:49:10.829 --> 03:49:14.979
MATT: No, this is just a melee attack.

03:49:14.979 --> 03:49:17.282
MARISHA: Fine, I'm going to bean her in the head.
Natural 20!

03:49:17.282 --> 03:49:22.052
MATT: Okay! Roll damage.

03:49:22.052 --> 03:49:24.213
LIAM: We've got the MVP over here.

03:49:24.213 --> 03:49:29.927
MARISHA: 12 damage! Bam!

03:49:29.927 --> 03:49:34.699
MATT: Crack! You hit her in the back of the head
as she stumbles forward and looks about the rest

03:49:34.699 --> 03:49:42.702
of you. She is using her last 5th-level spell to
attempt to cast another Dimension Door, out of the

03:49:42.702 --> 03:49:45.551
sight of the one who previously dispelled it.

03:49:45.551 --> 03:49:49.014
SAM: Can I Counterspell that?

03:49:49.014 --> 03:49:53.869
MATT: You have no visual on her. She is behind the
pillar. This time, she knew where you were and was

03:49:53.869 --> 03:49:57.502
not about to let that happen again. She disappears
behind the pillar, and you guys watch her step

03:49:57.502 --> 03:49:58.960
into the doorway and vanish from sight.

03:49:58.960 --> 03:49:59.755
LAURA: Seriously?

03:49:59.755 --> 03:50:01.029
MATT: She's still Hunter's Marked.

03:50:01.029 --> 03:50:02.108
LAURA: She's Hunter's Marked!

03:50:02.108 --> 03:50:03.822
MATT: You still have Hex on her, for as long as
that lasts.

03:50:03.822 --> 03:50:04.992
TALIESIN: That lasts a while.

03:50:04.992 --> 03:50:08.861
LAURA: Is he under the thing, still? Or did it
break?

03:50:08.861 --> 03:50:15.470
MATT: The flight lasts for an hour. The potion
lasts for an hour, and it's probably been about--

03:50:15.470 --> 03:50:17.017
LIAM: No, she's asking if I'm still--

03:50:17.017 --> 03:50:21.540
MATT: You currently? Yes. Make another
constitution saving throw.

03:50:21.540 --> 03:50:27.036
LIAM: Come on. Big roll. 13 plus nothing is 13.

03:50:27.036 --> 03:50:34.132
MATT: All right, so as you guys all look around
yourselves, Sylas disintegrated, Cassandra still

03:50:34.132 --> 03:50:38.588
holding the blades and looking around and is going
from a fight position, almost like a cornered

03:50:38.588 --> 03:50:44.685
creature, to looking at the sundering of her
brother and is looking completely frazzled and

03:50:44.685 --> 03:50:49.732
confused. She's on the verge of tears or a rage of
her own.

03:50:49.732 --> 03:50:54.382
You look over and see your brother down below and
is just standing there, his daggers dropped to the

03:50:54.382 --> 03:50:56.882
ground in front of him, and has been staring into
space this entire time.

03:50:56.882 --> 03:51:00.486
LAURA: I float down in front of him and slap him
across the face.

03:51:00.486 --> 03:51:04.218
MATT: Like that? Okay. Make another saving throw.

03:51:04.218 --> 03:51:07.407
LIAM: Nope.

03:51:07.407 --> 03:51:11.151
MATT: Okay. You slap, slap. He's taking it.

03:51:11.151 --> 03:51:13.366
ASHLEY: Can I go over to Vax?

03:51:13.366 --> 03:51:17.236
TRAVIS: Cassandra's still up, right?

03:51:17.236 --> 03:51:18.347
MATT: Cassandra is.

03:51:18.347 --> 03:51:22.269
ASHLEY: I'm going to Remove Curse on him.

03:51:22.269 --> 03:51:43.024
MATT: Okay. You cast Remove Curse. Let me see.
This is not considered a curse, so as the spell

03:51:43.024 --> 03:51:48.157
alleviates its energy into Vax, he still stands
there, staring into space.

03:51:48.157 --> 03:51:49.409
LAURA: Oh god.

03:51:49.409 --> 03:51:52.356
TRAVIS: Oh, wait, are we slapping Vax? Let me
try.

03:51:52.356 --> 03:51:55.363
LIAM: Yeah. You said something about a minute
before, though, didn't you?

03:51:55.363 --> 03:52:00.443
MATT: Yeah, so a little time goes by and then
eventually it wears off.

03:52:00.443 --> 03:52:02.922
TALIESIN: I'm going to start looking at that
door.

03:52:02.922 --> 03:52:04.760
TRAVIS: Is Cassandra still there?

03:52:04.760 --> 03:52:05.987
MATT: Yes, she is.

03:52:05.987 --> 03:52:08.540
TRAVIS: Can I grab her by the neck and walk her to
the edge of the pyramid?

03:52:08.633 --> 03:52:12.583
MATT: Yeah. You grab her, lift her. (choking
noise)

03:52:12.583 --> 03:52:13.813
TALIESIN: No, no! No.

03:52:13.813 --> 03:52:15.718
MATT: Drops her weapons as Grog takes her to the
edge.

03:52:15.718 --> 03:52:18.301
TALIESIN: No, let's not. Let's not.

03:52:18.301 --> 03:52:20.970
TRAVIS: Why not?

03:52:20.970 --> 03:52:31.103
LIAM: I walk up to Grog and her, and I face Percy
and repeat what Grog said. Why not?

03:52:31.103 --> 03:52:34.771
SAM: Is he still under her spell?

03:52:34.771 --> 03:52:43.117
TALIESIN: She's been here a very long time. Let's
just knock her unconscious and let her be.

03:52:43.117 --> 03:52:46.969
LIAM: I turn towards her, and I punch her across
the jaw as hard as I can.

03:52:46.969 --> 03:52:51.393
MATT: At this point, with the damage she's taken
and the mental shock she's in and the current

03:52:51.393 --> 03:52:55.065
circumstance, the one hit (whack) clocks her, and
she goes unconscious in his grip. Limp.

03:52:55.065 --> 03:52:57.178
LAURA: You can handcuff her behind her back.

03:52:57.178 --> 03:52:58.535
TRAVIS: We do have manacles.

03:52:58.535 --> 03:52:59.443
LAURA: Yeah.

03:52:59.443 --> 03:53:01.640
SAM: Put her in the Bag of Holding.

03:53:01.640 --> 03:53:03.509
OTHERS: No.

03:53:03.509 --> 03:53:04.854
TALIESIN: Thank you.

03:53:04.854 --> 03:53:09.032
LAURA: Maybe Greater Restoration her.

03:53:09.032 --> 03:53:11.884
ASHLEY: Yeah, can I Greater Restoration on her?

03:53:11.884 --> 03:53:15.034
MATT: Do you have another level of that spell?

03:53:15.034 --> 03:53:20.384
ASHLEY: No.

03:53:20.384 --> 03:53:23.154
MATT: Then you cannot. It's a 5th-level spell.

03:53:23.154 --> 03:53:25.535
TALIESIN: We can save it for later.

03:53:25.535 --> 03:53:26.975
ASHLEY: Keyleth?

03:53:26.975 --> 03:53:29.908
TRAVIS: I take some of the manacles, and I manacle
her hands behind her back.

03:53:29.908 --> 03:53:31.043
MATT: Okay.

03:53:31.043 --> 03:53:32.562
MARISHA: What's up, Pike?

03:53:32.562 --> 03:53:34.579
ASHLEY: Do you have Greater Restoration?

03:53:34.579 --> 03:53:37.705
MARISHA: Not on me. Not today.

03:53:37.705 --> 03:53:39.615
TALIESIN: I'm going to start working with that
door.

03:53:39.615 --> 03:53:45.508
TRAVIS: And to be super shitty, I grab a length of
rope and wrap it around her ankles and tie it back

03:53:45.508 --> 03:53:47.615
to her hands so she can't stand up.

03:53:47.615 --> 03:53:50.554
LAURA: Oh. Sorry, Cassandra. That's going to
suck.

03:53:50.554 --> 03:53:52.026
TRAVIS: She's got to stay there when she wakes
up.

03:53:52.026 --> 03:53:58.849
MATT: All right. Bigby's Hand does last a minute,
if you want to keep it maintained. The minute has

03:53:58.849 --> 03:54:00.683
passed at this time. It's probably going to pass.

03:54:00.683 --> 03:54:06.628
SAM: All right, before it passes, it gives me a
quick deep-tissue massage.

03:54:06.628 --> 03:54:07.907
MATT: Okay.

03:54:07.907 --> 03:54:11.179
TRAVIS: Can I pick up Sylas's onyx sword?

03:54:11.179 --> 03:54:12.811
MATT: You can, yeah.

03:54:12.811 --> 03:54:15.812
TALIESIN: What does a common healing potion do, by
the way?

03:54:15.812 --> 03:54:21.538
MATT: It'll require a short rest to attune and get
the nature of it, but it is a very beautiful new

03:54:21.538 --> 03:54:22.705
weapon.

03:54:22.705 --> 03:54:24.278
TRAVIS: Okay. I'll put it in the Bag of Holding.

03:54:24.278 --> 03:54:28.532
TALIESIN: You picked up his sword? Good. That's
why I had him drop it.

03:54:28.532 --> 03:54:29.899
TRAVIS: Yeah, I noticed.

03:54:29.899 --> 03:54:31.754
MARISHA: So he wouldn't disintegrate with it?

03:54:31.754 --> 03:54:35.683
TALIESIN: Yeah, and so one of us, possibly me,
could use it.

03:54:35.683 --> 03:54:37.719
SAM: Have a better sword than your piece of shit?

03:54:37.719 --> 03:54:39.770
TRAVIS: Do you want it?

03:54:39.770 --> 03:54:41.295
MARISHA: We have to find her. She's somewhere
close.

03:54:41.295 --> 03:54:43.171
TRAVIS: I'll give him the sword. He's got the onyx
sword.

03:54:43.171 --> 03:54:46.247
MATT: There is a brooch also left on the ground
from the ashes left behind.

03:54:46.247 --> 03:54:49.187
SAM: I'll pick it up and look at it.

03:54:49.187 --> 03:54:53.309
MATT: Okay. These items will take a little time to
look over.

03:54:53.309 --> 03:54:55.292
SAM: I'll look at it for a whole ten seconds.

03:54:55.292 --> 03:54:56.458
MATT: Okay.

03:54:56.458 --> 03:55:00.349
TALIESIN: Do I get my strength back, by the way?
I'm just down?

03:55:00.349 --> 03:55:01.375
MATT: Just down.

03:55:01.375 --> 03:55:06.118
LAURA: Can I see, from being on the roof, what's
inside the building? You said there's no roof to

03:55:06.118 --> 03:55:09.217
that temple I was up on top of.

03:55:09.217 --> 03:55:19.331
MATT: Correct. If you're looking inside of it
right now? You glance over. It's an open-roofed

03:55:19.331 --> 03:55:25.240
square construct. There are two hallways that lead
to the inside on both sides. The walls have a

03:55:25.240 --> 03:55:29.591
strange icy texture to them; it's hard to make out
the details from what little light is in there.

03:55:29.591 --> 03:55:34.253
There is a central platform that rises up in the
middle. There is a stairway on the opposite side

03:55:34.253 --> 03:55:39.672
of the room that leads up to that platform, and
there are a series of grooves in the ground that

03:55:39.672 --> 03:55:44.065
form some sort of shape that you can't make out
from this viewpoint. You do see Lady Briarwood

03:55:44.113 --> 03:55:46.004
atop that platform right now.

03:55:46.004 --> 03:55:47.417
SAM: How far?

03:55:47.417 --> 03:55:48.772
LAURA: She's inside the temple.

03:55:48.772 --> 03:55:53.670
TALIESIN: Let's go in. I took a minor healing
potion. Is that 2d8?

03:55:53.670 --> 03:55:57.251
MATT: A minor? A regular one is 2d4 plus two.

03:55:57.251 --> 03:56:06.499
SAM: Here, I'll trade you one. I trade him a
greater for a common. I take the common.

03:56:06.499 --> 03:56:08.258
TALIESIN: What's the greater do?

03:56:08.258 --> 03:56:10.237
SAM: Greater is 4d4 plus four.

03:56:10.237 --> 03:56:13.361
LAURA: Can I drop the rope down from the roof
where I'm at, so everybody can get up in?

03:56:13.361 --> 03:56:16.693
MATT: Get up and over? Yeah, you can do that.

03:56:16.693 --> 03:56:17.810
LAURA: Okay. I'm going to do that.

03:56:17.810 --> 03:56:22.125
MATT: Okay. It'll take you a while to do that. As
you drop the rope--

03:56:22.125 --> 03:56:25.275
LAURA: I don't know if you want to try the doors,
but I just thought we could get in.

03:56:25.275 --> 03:56:29.099
MATT: Okay, you lower the rope.

03:56:29.099 --> 03:56:37.691
LIAM: I'm going to walk up to my sister and take
her hand and squeeze it as hard as I can, and just

03:56:37.691 --> 03:56:39.595
walk forward with her.

03:56:39.595 --> 03:56:43.856
MATT: She's up on top of the roof. She lowers the
rope and starts taking you guys up one by one.

03:56:43.856 --> 03:56:49.038
Vex, you do notice out of the corner of your eye
as you lower the rope, there is a flash of

03:56:49.038 --> 03:56:54.563
greenish light from the center platform, and from
the distance, you can see Delilah is up on the

03:56:54.563 --> 03:56:56.684
platform reading from some sort of scroll.

03:56:56.684 --> 03:56:58.360
LIAM: How far away is she?

03:56:58.360 --> 03:57:03.896
MATT: She's about 80 feet from you.

03:57:03.896 --> 03:57:05.749
TALIESIN: I pull out Bad News.

03:57:05.749 --> 03:57:10.352
MATT: None of you guys can see her. Only she sees
her. You guys are still on the ground. She's on

03:57:10.352 --> 03:57:11.174
the roof.

03:57:11.174 --> 03:57:12.895
LAURA: I lowered the rope so you guys can start
climbing up.

03:57:12.895 --> 03:57:13.842
TALIESIN: I'm climbing up.

03:57:13.842 --> 03:57:15.883
LIAM: Can I see her, if I've gone up to her?

03:57:15.883 --> 03:57:19.530
MATT: You're the first one to climb up. She just
lowered the rope, so you're finding your way up

03:57:19.530 --> 03:57:20.633
now. You haven't even seen her yet.

03:57:20.633 --> 03:57:22.074
LIAM: All right.

03:57:22.074 --> 03:57:28.780
MATT: You notice all the ice on the walls shatters
and clinks to the ground. You can hear the sound

03:57:28.780 --> 03:57:33.572
of a million little shards of ice clinking onto
the ground and you can see the walls almost seem

03:57:33.572 --> 03:57:35.421
like they're moving or writhing slightly.

03:57:35.421 --> 03:57:36.776
LAURA: Ugh. Can I shoot at her?

03:57:36.776 --> 03:57:37.951
MATT: If you'd like to, yeah.

03:57:37.951 --> 03:57:38.895
LAURA: I want to.

03:57:38.895 --> 03:57:39.740
MATT: Okay.

03:57:39.740 --> 03:57:40.622
LAURA: Okay.

03:57:40.622 --> 03:57:41.855
TRAVIS: Percy, get up the fucking rope.

03:57:41.855 --> 03:57:43.378
TALIESIN: I'm heading straight up there.

03:57:43.378 --> 03:57:45.603
MATT: What's your range increment for your
longbow?

03:57:45.657 --> 03:57:47.334
LAURA: I don't see it.

03:57:47.334 --> 03:57:50.240
MATT: I'll look it up under the equipment section
in the book.

03:57:50.240 --> 03:57:51.768
LAURA: It doesn't say on the--

03:57:51.768 --> 03:57:55.806
LIAM: I'm going to start throwing as soon as I'm
near my sister.

03:57:55.806 --> 03:57:58.080
SAM: Oh, Vax. Hi.

03:57:58.080 --> 03:57:59.063
LIAM: Hi.

03:57:59.063 --> 03:58:00.437
LAURA: You can't throw 80 feet.

03:58:00.437 --> 03:58:01.656
LIAM: No, but I could get closer.

03:58:01.656 --> 03:58:04.066
LAURA: No, you can't. We're on the roof around
it.

03:58:04.066 --> 03:58:08.243
TRAVIS: A real man could throw 80 feet.

03:58:08.243 --> 03:58:11.387
LIAM: That's true, Grog. That's true. That's a
good point.

03:58:11.387 --> 03:58:12.912
LAURA: I feel like it's 120 feet.

03:58:12.912 --> 03:58:18.940
MATT: It's 150 feet, so yeah. There's no serious
issue there. You can go ahead. You have

03:58:18.940 --> 03:58:20.079
disadvantage on the strike.

03:58:20.079 --> 03:58:20.967
LAURA: Oh, I do?

03:58:20.967 --> 03:58:23.920
MATT: Because her image is still shimmering.

03:58:23.920 --> 03:58:25.866
LAURA: That's great, then 13.

03:58:25.931 --> 03:58:27.823
MATT: 13. Arrow (whoosh) disappears into the
darkness.

03:58:27.823 --> 03:58:29.035
LAURA: Can I hit her again?

03:58:29.035 --> 03:58:30.119
MATT: Go for it.

03:58:30.119 --> 03:58:34.727
LIAM: What is the relationship to her, if I've
just gotten next to her?

03:58:34.727 --> 03:58:36.978
SAM: She was married to Sylas.

03:58:36.978 --> 03:58:39.763
LIAM: No, shut up, you. Where are we, and where is
she?

03:58:39.763 --> 03:58:43.828
MATT: Okay, so if you want to come up to the top
and start looking.

03:58:43.828 --> 03:58:48.351
SAM: Oh god! That looks like a big hand.

03:58:48.351 --> 03:58:49.974
LAURA: It's a Bigby Hand!

03:58:49.974 --> 03:58:53.951
SAM: You know what they say about guys with Bigby
Hands?

03:58:53.951 --> 03:58:56.959
MARISHA: Bigby Gloves?

03:58:56.959 --> 03:58:59.282
LAURA: 20 was the second arrow that I shot at
her.

03:58:59.282 --> 03:59:02.286
MATT: 20? 20 would hit.

03:59:02.286 --> 03:59:09.635
TRAVIS: Percy, are you up there yet?

03:59:09.635 --> 03:59:14.210
LIAM: Are we on the edge of a ledge or a wall?

03:59:14.210 --> 03:59:19.251
MATT: There's a ledge that goes around the entire
wall that encases this, but there's no roof. It's

03:59:19.251 --> 03:59:25.400
just an open square area. So you would get up to
there.

03:59:25.400 --> 03:59:27.038
MARISHA: Can I go up next?

03:59:27.038 --> 03:59:30.059
LAURA: Can I maybe go through the piece of paper
that she's reading?

03:59:30.059 --> 03:59:35.649
MATT: That would've been something to call before
you shot her. Next attack you can, if you want.

03:59:35.649 --> 03:59:38.086
LIAM: So you said Jennifer Lopez is 80 feet from
us?

03:59:38.086 --> 03:59:41.420
MATT: Roughly, yeah.

03:59:41.420 --> 03:59:43.449
TALIESIN: I head up, as well.

03:59:43.449 --> 03:59:46.804
LAURA: 19 damage to her is what I rolled.

03:59:46.804 --> 03:59:54.791
MATT: 19 damage? Okay. Strikes her. The arrow hits
and gleans off her. The damage, much like Percy's,

03:59:54.791 --> 03:59:59.109
is not quite having the full damage you want it
to.

03:59:59.109 --> 04:00:04.910
However, as that hits, she reaches into her
pocket and pulls something out. Percy, you get to

04:00:04.962 --> 04:00:07.987
the top there. Who's up next?

04:00:07.987 --> 04:00:09.237
MARISHA: I'll go.

04:00:09.237 --> 04:00:10.383
ASHLEY: I'll go.

04:00:10.383 --> 04:00:12.719
SAM: I'm always behind Pike.

04:00:12.719 --> 04:00:17.744
MATT: All right, the rest of you gather at the
bottom here. Trinket's going to have a hard time

04:00:17.744 --> 04:00:18.721
getting up there.

04:00:18.721 --> 04:00:20.555
TALIESIN: I'm going to take 80 feet--

04:00:20.555 --> 04:00:24.279
MATT: Well, before that happens, as a reaction to
that, she pulls something out of her hand. There's

04:00:24.347 --> 04:00:29.187
a streak of red light that arcs upward, and
there's a slight shrieking sound as a familiar

04:00:29.187 --> 04:00:36.008
arcane blast hits, a Fireball bursts on the
roof area around all of you. (explosion noise) I

04:00:36.078 --> 04:00:38.742
need a dexterity saving throw from all three of
you guys up there.

04:00:38.742 --> 04:00:43.484
MARISHA: Who's up there right now?

04:00:43.536 --> 04:00:45.299
LAURA: Do we get advantage on it at all?

04:00:45.299 --> 04:00:46.585
MATT: Nope.

04:00:46.585 --> 04:00:51.245
LIAM: 15. Can I use Uncanny Dodge at this moment?

04:00:51.245 --> 04:00:55.867
MATT: You mean to lower that damage by half?

04:00:55.867 --> 04:00:56.595
LIAM: Yeah.

04:00:56.595 --> 04:00:57.645
MATT: You can, yeah.

04:00:57.645 --> 04:00:59.294
LIAM: What, is she casting a spell?

04:00:59.294 --> 04:01:00.188
MATT: Yeah.

04:01:00.188 --> 04:01:03.558
LIAM: I can also use Evasion.

04:01:03.640 --> 04:01:04.761
MATT: You failed the save.

04:01:04.761 --> 04:01:12.747
LIAM: Right, but depending on what it is. Those
both do different things. Okay, they do the same

04:01:12.747 --> 04:01:13.821
thing. Sorry.

04:01:13.821 --> 04:01:16.654
MATT: It's okay. All right, so saving throws for
Percy?

04:01:16.654 --> 04:01:17.735
TALIESIN: 25.

04:01:17.735 --> 04:01:19.775
MATT: 25 for your dex?

04:01:19.775 --> 04:01:20.817
TALIESIN: I rolled a 19.

04:01:20.817 --> 04:01:21.774
MATT: That's great.

04:01:21.774 --> 04:01:22.615
LAURA: 16.

04:01:22.615 --> 04:01:23.475
MATT: 16.

04:01:23.475 --> 04:01:26.579
LIAM: It was a 15, so half damage.

04:01:26.579 --> 04:01:37.356
MATT: All right, so you take half damage. That is
36 points of fire damage to you. That would be 18

04:01:37.356 --> 04:01:44.942
to both of you guys. 18 points of fire damage.

04:01:44.942 --> 04:01:48.146
LAURA: Another 18 points of fire damage?

04:01:48.146 --> 04:01:50.599
MATT: No, just to them. You took full damage.

04:01:50.599 --> 04:01:51.558
LAURA: Oh, okay.

04:01:51.558 --> 04:01:53.701
MATT: Okay, next person at the rope?

04:01:53.701 --> 04:01:54.820
MARISHA: Me.

04:01:54.820 --> 04:01:56.521
MATT: All right. Keyleth, you make your way up to
the top.

04:01:56.521 --> 04:01:57.902
TALIESIN: Can I fire now?

04:01:57.902 --> 04:01:59.274
MATT: Yeah.

04:01:59.274 --> 04:02:07.881
TALIESIN: It's 80 feet? It's within the Pepperbox
range. I'm going to shoot

04:02:07.881 --> 04:02:10.460
for the scroll with fire.

04:02:10.460 --> 04:02:12.173
MATT: Okay.

04:02:12.173 --> 04:02:18.005
MARISHA: Yeah, good call.

04:02:18.005 --> 04:02:22.906
TALIESIN: That rolled really low. I can use that
bonus die. I rolled within my--

04:02:22.906 --> 04:02:25.933
MATT: Misfire?

04:02:25.933 --> 04:02:27.563
TALIESIN: Can I use the--

04:02:27.563 --> 04:02:29.704
MATT: The natural roll is still what counts for
misfire, unfortunately.

04:02:29.704 --> 04:02:32.526
LAURA: Oh no.

04:02:32.526 --> 04:02:35.762
TALIESIN: I'm going to try and fix it.

04:02:35.762 --> 04:02:36.848
MATT: Okay.

04:02:36.848 --> 04:02:41.347
TALIESIN: No.

04:02:41.347 --> 04:02:43.522
MATT: Pepperbox is broken.

04:02:43.522 --> 04:02:49.248
LAURA: Have I recovered at all to shoot again?
Have I recovered enough to shoot at her again?

04:02:49.248 --> 04:02:50.568
MATT: You will in a second.

04:02:50.568 --> 04:02:53.490
TALIESIN: Pepperbox is completely broken.

04:02:53.490 --> 04:02:55.213
MATT: Yeah, unusable.

04:02:55.213 --> 04:02:57.053
SAM: Oh no, if only we had another gun.

04:02:57.053 --> 04:02:57.954
LAURA: I know.

04:02:57.954 --> 04:02:59.382
SAM: Oh, wait. We do.

04:02:59.382 --> 04:03:00.385
LAURA: Bad News.

04:03:00.385 --> 04:03:01.681
SAM: No, we have another gun.

04:03:01.681 --> 04:03:02.557
TALIESIN: We have two more guns.

04:03:02.557 --> 04:03:04.430
MARISHA: We have Ripley's gun.

04:03:04.430 --> 04:03:05.456
SAM: Give it to me.

04:03:05.456 --> 04:03:06.472
LAURA: Are you up on top?

04:03:06.472 --> 04:03:07.289
SAM: No.

04:03:07.289 --> 04:03:08.480
LAURA: I can't give it to you.

04:03:08.480 --> 04:03:10.969
TALIESIN: Do I still have-- are we still--

04:03:10.969 --> 04:03:12.682
MATT: You have one more attack.

04:03:12.682 --> 04:03:14.218
TALIESIN: Bad News.

04:03:14.218 --> 04:03:19.245
MATT: You'll get Bad News out. That's it. All
right, with that--

04:03:19.245 --> 04:03:20.513
LIAM: Matthew.

04:03:20.513 --> 04:03:21.606
MATT: Yes?

04:03:21.606 --> 04:03:23.496
LIAM: You're very good at this.

04:03:23.496 --> 04:03:24.903
MATT: What do you want to do?

04:03:24.903 --> 04:03:26.847
LIAM: That's it. I just want to say you're very
good at this.

04:03:26.847 --> 04:03:33.066
MATT: (giggles, sighs) We're running a little
late. Trying to get through this climactic moment,

04:03:33.155 --> 04:03:34.299
guys. Apologies.

04:03:34.299 --> 04:03:35.683
MARISHA: Are we running late?

04:03:35.683 --> 04:03:36.764
TALIESIN: Don't look.

04:03:36.764 --> 04:03:37.703
MARISHA: It's fine.

04:03:37.703 --> 04:03:39.046
MATT: Sorry, guys.

04:03:39.046 --> 04:03:41.641
MARISHA: Crew hates us.

04:03:41.641 --> 04:03:48.058
MATT: I know. It's okay. I'll make it up to them.
At this point, the scroll (fluttering noise)

04:03:48.058 --> 04:04:01.402
vanishes. She, as a bonus action at the top of
this turn, gashes across her wrist and spreads her

04:04:01.402 --> 04:04:06.180
own life's blood across what looks to be this dark
orb, about a foot in diameter, that's resting in

04:04:06.180 --> 04:04:08.185
the center of this upper platform.

04:04:08.185 --> 04:04:09.957
LAURA: Can I take a potion really fast?

04:04:09.957 --> 04:04:12.691
MATT: At the top of your turn, you can, as a bonus
action.

04:04:12.691 --> 04:04:15.447
MARISHA: The orb is floating?

04:04:15.447 --> 04:04:18.936
MATT: The dark orb in the center of the platform
that she's currently on in the center of this

04:04:18.936 --> 04:04:23.760
room. It's half-embedded in the ground, and she
scatters her blood across it. You can see her

04:04:23.760 --> 04:04:26.682
shaking with fear and trepidation during this
whole circumstance.

04:04:26.682 --> 04:04:30.980
MARISHA: She splatters her blood on the dark
sphere?

04:04:30.980 --> 04:04:34.326
MATT: Make a perception check, those who are up
top, by the way. Who's up next?

04:04:34.326 --> 04:04:37.293
TALIESIN: Jesus Christ. 16.

04:04:37.293 --> 04:04:39.816
MARISHA: One.

04:04:39.816 --> 04:04:40.793
LAURA: What are we trying to do?

04:04:40.793 --> 04:04:42.640
MATT: Perception. Scanlan gets up.

04:04:42.640 --> 04:04:45.088
SAM: Hey. Hi, guys! What's going-- oh.

04:04:45.088 --> 04:04:46.440
LIAM: 20.

04:04:46.440 --> 04:04:48.043
SAM: She's bleeding all over that thing?

04:04:48.043 --> 04:04:55.151
MATT: Those who got 15 or higher, you notice the
writhing on the walls. The walls are encased in

04:04:55.151 --> 04:05:03.247
what looks like a tapestry of bodies. Hundreds of
humanoid individuals that are woven into each

04:05:03.247 --> 04:05:09.575
other, each missing their left hand and/or left
eye from their body, and they're all just

04:05:09.575 --> 04:05:15.566
squirming and writhing. Many of them are in
various states of decay, and they're just moving

04:05:15.566 --> 04:05:21.395
after that ice that was encasing them had
shattered. There's a low, weird moaning drone

04:05:21.395 --> 04:05:27.139
that's beginning to fill the room. The black orb
itself is starting to rise out of the center of

04:05:27.225 --> 04:05:28.957
the pedestal, as well.

04:05:28.957 --> 04:05:36.269
Now, Vex, since you had the top of this, and Vax.
What do you want to do?

04:05:36.269 --> 04:05:40.847
LIAM: Wait, there's an orb coming up from where?

04:05:40.847 --> 04:05:42.455
TRAVIS: The center of the pedestal.

04:05:42.455 --> 04:05:43.922
MATT: The center of the platform she's on.

04:05:43.922 --> 04:05:45.587
SAM: She's got blood on it. She's doing a magic
ritual.

04:05:45.587 --> 04:05:47.859
LIAM: And we're how high in the air from the floor
that she's on?

04:05:47.859 --> 04:05:51.762
MATT: I'd say you're about 30 feet up. She's about
40 feet up. She's actually risen a little above

04:05:51.762 --> 04:05:52.686
you guys.

04:05:52.686 --> 04:05:56.415
LAURA: I'm going to guzzle a potion, and then I'm
going to shoot Percy's special arrow, question

04:05:56.415 --> 04:05:58.072
mark? At the orb.

04:05:58.072 --> 04:06:04.079
SAM: At the orb? You're not going to stop this
with an arrow. It's happened already. It's done.

04:06:04.079 --> 04:06:08.410
LIAM: If I go to the very edge, how far am I from
her?

04:06:08.410 --> 04:06:13.726
LAURA: Then what am I supposed to do? Killing her,
what good will it do?

04:06:13.726 --> 04:06:15.103
MATT: 55 feet away.

04:06:15.103 --> 04:06:17.039
LAURA: Maybe she's a sacrifice, at this point.

04:06:17.039 --> 04:06:18.666
LIAM: That's within range, right?

04:06:18.666 --> 04:06:19.913
MATT: Of your daggers?

04:06:19.913 --> 04:06:22.251
LIAM: Yeah. I'm throwing, then, at her.

04:06:22.251 --> 04:06:23.876
MATT: What's the throwing dagger range?

04:06:23.876 --> 04:06:28.317
LIAM: 60 feet, because I'm sharpshooter, so I take
no disadvantage.

04:06:28.317 --> 04:06:31.092
MATT: Then...

04:06:31.092 --> 04:06:34.460
LIAM: Yeah, I don't like her.

04:06:34.460 --> 04:06:36.419
MATT: 20/60, so yeah, you can still hit her.

04:06:36.419 --> 04:06:40.405
LIAM: Yeah, so I'm going to throw two daggers at
her. I don't know if there's any poison left-- I'm

04:06:40.405 --> 04:06:48.837
sure there's not-- on the Life-Stealing, and the
Keen. First one is not good at all. That's a 14,

04:06:48.837 --> 04:07:02.663
and the second one hits. That's a 28. That is the
Life-Stealing. That is seven points of damage.

04:07:02.743 --> 04:07:07.510
MATT: Okay. All right. Vex?

04:07:07.510 --> 04:07:09.608
LAURA: I had said I was going to shoot the orb.

04:07:09.608 --> 04:07:11.280
MATT: Go for it.

04:07:11.280 --> 04:07:14.135
LAURA: All right. I'm going to shoot the special
arrow, question mark.

04:07:14.135 --> 04:07:17.792
TRAVIS: Plus, you're left-handed, and she
apparently has things against lefties.

04:07:17.792 --> 04:07:19.117
LAURA: Yeah, exactly.

04:07:19.117 --> 04:07:20.902
LIAM: You flicked me in the left nut. Are you
complicit?

04:07:20.902 --> 04:07:22.903
TRAVIS: You don't know.

04:07:22.903 --> 04:07:25.956
LAURA: 23?

04:07:26.020 --> 04:07:30.331
MATT: 23? Okay. That does hit the orb. Roll
damage.

04:07:30.331 --> 04:07:35.353
LAURA: I don't know what I'm doing!

04:07:35.353 --> 04:07:37.547
LIAM: Let's see what happens.

04:07:37.547 --> 04:07:38.816
LAURA: 15?

04:07:38.816 --> 04:07:43.104
MATT: Okay, the arrow streaks off and seemingly
hits the orb. Splinters across the surface.

04:07:43.104 --> 04:07:46.468
TALIESIN: It was the arrow, question mark.

04:07:46.468 --> 04:07:59.158
MATT: Oh, it was the explosive one? Oh, okay. The
arrow arcs off. Did you roll with disadvantage on

04:07:59.241 --> 04:08:01.388
that one because it is the explosive arrow?

04:08:01.388 --> 04:08:07.875
LAURA: Oh shit. No. 15.

04:08:07.875 --> 04:08:14.250
MATT: 15. The arrow whizzes past and slams into
the bottom of the pillar. You see a muffled

04:08:14.250 --> 04:08:20.205
explosion and light flash, and it rocks the center
a bit, but she still maintains concentration. She

04:08:20.205 --> 04:08:22.137
looks over at where it came from.

04:08:22.137 --> 04:08:25.490
LAURA: Should I have shot her? I'm sorry. I should
have shot her!

04:08:25.490 --> 04:08:28.137
SAM: It's fine. It wouldn't have done anything.

04:08:28.137 --> 04:08:33.127
MARISHA: Can I try something? Am I able to try
something? Is she still bleeding

04:08:33.127 --> 04:08:34.420
all over this orb?

04:08:34.420 --> 04:08:39.344
MATT: The bleeding has finished. The orb is rising
up and pulsing.

04:08:39.344 --> 04:08:40.486
LIAM: Question.

04:08:40.486 --> 04:08:41.428
MATT: Yes.

04:08:41.428 --> 04:08:42.465
LIAM: Did we surprise her?

04:08:42.465 --> 04:08:44.668
MATT: No, she is well aware of you guys.

04:08:44.668 --> 04:08:49.455
LIAM: She's well aware that we're here. Did I go
before her? Is there initiative here? Did I go

04:08:49.455 --> 04:08:50.497
before her turn?

04:08:50.497 --> 04:08:53.050
MATT: Right now, as people arrive, I'm
counting this. I'll probably do initiative after

04:08:53.050 --> 04:08:55.082
we finish this set.

04:08:55.153 --> 04:08:56.394
LAURA: Can I still fly?

04:08:56.394 --> 04:08:59.006
MATT: You can still fly if you want, yeah.

04:08:59.006 --> 04:09:00.380
SAM: How far?

04:09:00.380 --> 04:09:01.489
MATT: 55 feet.

04:09:01.489 --> 04:09:04.818
SAM: Am I going soon?

04:09:04.818 --> 04:09:06.151
MATT: We're getting to that now.

04:09:06.151 --> 04:09:09.210
LIAM: I think this is going to be shot down, and
I'm fine if it is, but I know that with

04:09:09.210 --> 04:09:13.416
Assassinate, if I go before the enemy does, it's
an automatic critical.

04:09:13.416 --> 04:09:21.523
MATT: This is one of those circumstances where you
guys have been already in combat. This isn't a

04:09:21.530 --> 04:09:25.644
scenario where you got the jump on them. She's
aware that you guys are there and she's just

04:09:25.644 --> 04:09:27.581
trying to finish this while ignoring that
circumstance.

04:09:27.581 --> 04:09:32.075
LAURA: I'm going to pull out a fancy robe from my
bag and I'm going to try to fly towards the orb.

04:09:32.075 --> 04:09:33.306
MATT: Okay.

04:09:33.306 --> 04:09:34.684
MARISHA: While she does that--

04:09:34.684 --> 04:09:38.066
TALIESIN: Keyleth's got shit.

04:09:38.066 --> 04:09:40.362
MARISHA: It's not going to work, but I can try.

04:09:40.362 --> 04:09:42.614
MATT: All right, you three.

04:09:42.614 --> 04:09:52.419
MARISHA: Okay, so you could argue that our bodies
are made of 70 percent water, right, so if I cast

04:09:52.419 --> 04:09:56.584
Control Water, can I move her blood?

04:09:56.584 --> 04:10:06.925
MATT: You can certainly try. Her blood has already
cast across the orb and it seems to have initiated

04:10:06.925 --> 04:10:12.421
whatever is part of it. There's not still blood
pouring onto it; she scattered across it once.

04:10:12.421 --> 04:10:16.322
MARISHA: So wiping the blood off probably wouldn't
work?

04:10:16.322 --> 04:10:17.453
MATT: You can try.

04:10:17.453 --> 04:10:18.836
TRAVIS: Let's say no.

04:10:18.836 --> 04:10:22.176
LIAM: If she rolls really high. Really high.

04:10:22.176 --> 04:10:24.952
TALIESIN: How good do you feel about a natural
20?

04:10:24.952 --> 04:10:30.198
MARISHA: "How good do you feel about a natural
20?" Well, judging by the shit that's been going

04:10:30.198 --> 04:10:36.338
down today-- fuck it! I already said it. I'm going
to do it. I'm going to do Control Water and I'm

04:10:36.338 --> 04:10:40.574
going to see if I can suck all the blood off of
the orb.

04:10:40.574 --> 04:10:45.379
MATT: Okay. Roll a d20, add your wisdom modifier.

04:10:45.379 --> 04:10:48.422
MARISHA: Okay. Oh, did you see that?

04:10:48.422 --> 04:10:51.547
TALIESIN: I did. That was cruel.

04:10:51.547 --> 04:10:53.153
MARISHA: It was on a 20.

04:10:53.153 --> 04:10:54.306
TALIESIN: And then it bounced.

04:10:54.306 --> 04:10:56.596
MARISHA: 15.

04:10:56.596 --> 04:11:03.600
MATT: Okay. Focusing from this distance, you try
to-- The blood shifts across the surface, but there

04:11:03.600 --> 04:11:09.333
is some sort of power that's holding it to the
orb. It is unmoved. I know. Scanlan?

04:11:09.333 --> 04:11:11.457
SAM: I've got one shot at this, right?

04:11:11.457 --> 04:11:12.623
LIAM: Yes.

04:11:12.623 --> 04:11:18.258
SAM: I'm going to try to cast-- I can't cast
anything anymore. I'm going to try to cast

04:11:18.258 --> 04:11:28.207
Suggestion on her, and I will say, 
Stop, collaborate and listen. Because I'm a gnome

04:11:28.421 --> 04:11:35.426
who's on a mission. Follow me as I kill your
husband the lich, and I'll make you my bitch.

04:11:35.426 --> 04:11:37.625
TRAVIS: Her husband was a vampire.

04:11:37.625 --> 04:11:39.025
SAM: Oh, yeah. Whatever.

04:11:39.025 --> 04:11:40.224
MATT: It didn't rhyme. It's fine.

04:11:40.224 --> 04:11:44.616
LIAM: Come on. Hail Mary pass, here we go.

04:11:44.616 --> 04:11:48.183
MATT: Okay.

04:11:48.183 --> 04:11:56.905
SAM: Suggestion is a-- oh, she probably can't be
charmed. It's a wisdom saving throw.

04:11:56.905 --> 04:12:00.184
MATT: Okay, she rolled a 19. What's your DC on
that?

04:12:00.184 --> 04:12:01.435
SAM: 19.

04:12:01.435 --> 04:12:03.078
MATT: 19. Yeah, with the cone.

04:12:03.078 --> 04:12:04.666
(groaning)

04:12:04.666 --> 04:12:06.264
LIAM: Good attempt, though, Sam.

04:12:06.264 --> 04:12:09.191
SAM: Never mind! Carry on!

04:12:09.191 --> 04:12:10.199
MATT: Percy?

04:12:10.199 --> 04:12:19.602
TALIESIN: I'm going to take a shot with Bad News
because this is getting really ridiculous. I'm

04:12:19.602 --> 04:12:28.632
going to try and get her attention and get her to
pay attention. Let's have a normal roll. Oh, for

04:12:28.632 --> 04:12:30.561
the love of God!

04:12:30.561 --> 04:12:31.709
MARISHA: No.

04:12:31.709 --> 04:12:33.099
LIAM: One? 20?

04:12:33.099 --> 04:12:34.511
TALIESIN: So, Bad News--

04:12:34.511 --> 04:12:37.299
LAURA: Misfire?

04:12:37.299 --> 04:12:39.107
MATT: All right, try and repair it.

04:12:39.107 --> 04:12:41.854
TALIESIN: Just barely!

04:12:41.854 --> 04:12:42.979
MATT: Okay.

04:12:42.979 --> 04:12:53.526
TALIESIN: And I can try and get one more bullet to
come out of it at this point, so I'm going to make

04:12:53.526 --> 04:13:02.010
one last attempt to make it shoot, after clearing
the chamber. Better! Jesus H. Christ. 24.

04:13:02.010 --> 04:13:03.210
MATT: That'll hit.

04:13:03.210 --> 04:13:06.429
LIAM: Come on. Coup de grace.

04:13:06.429 --> 04:13:09.069
MARISHA: Coup de grace.

04:13:09.069 --> 04:13:13.841
TALIESIN: This is at least going to get her
attention.

04:13:13.841 --> 04:13:24.747
MARISHA: At least distract her. Come on, Percy.
That was a 12 on a d12, which is dope.

04:13:24.747 --> 04:13:28.737
TALIESIN: Yeah, that's 21. 27 points of damage.

04:13:28.737 --> 04:13:34.512
MATT: Okay. So the (gunshot noise) blast from Bad
News scatters through the air and slams into her

04:13:34.512 --> 04:13:37.962
side, and she's nearly thrown off the top of the
platform from the blast of it. You can see blood

04:13:37.962 --> 04:13:42.516
streaking down her other arm now, and she has
blood down the side of her face, down one arm and

04:13:42.516 --> 04:13:47.743
the other, and she's shaking in place on the
platform. She sees you lifting towards, holding

04:13:47.743 --> 04:13:52.300
the robe to the side, and she's looking at the
orb, and doesn't even seem to really know what's

04:13:52.362 --> 04:13:56.232
going to happen. There's this anticipation and
fear in her eyes. Everything's been torn from her,

04:13:56.232 --> 04:13:58.852
at this point. She's a caged animal with nothing
to lose.

04:13:58.852 --> 04:14:07.939
That finishes your turn. Taking her turn, she sees
you rushing towards her. She extends her finger--

04:14:07.939 --> 04:14:11.014
LAURA: Oh, wait! I took a potion. I took a potion!
I said it on the last turn, and I didn't use it.

04:14:11.014 --> 04:14:12.709
MATT: What did you roll?

04:14:12.709 --> 04:14:17.042
LAURA: I don't know how much to roll for a greater
healing potion. That's why I didn't do it.

04:14:17.042 --> 04:14:20.588
MATT: That is 4d4 plus four.

04:14:20.588 --> 04:14:25.184
LAURA: (whispering) I'm going to die.

04:14:25.184 --> 04:14:26.391
LIAM: No. No.

04:14:26.391 --> 04:14:28.588
LAURA: No, I'm serious. I'm going to die right
now.

04:14:28.588 --> 04:14:32.777
LIAM: No! Shut up. Four and-- pretty good.

04:14:32.777 --> 04:14:41.608
LAURA: Okay.

04:14:41.608 --> 04:14:42.940
LIAM: That's good.

04:14:42.940 --> 04:14:44.715
MATT: What are you at?

04:14:44.715 --> 04:14:46.017
LAURA: 76.

04:14:46.017 --> 04:14:52.867
MATT: Okay. She extends her finger towards you
with a look, and there's this point of

04:14:52.867 --> 04:14:55.008
recognition, this moment, where you're like--

04:14:55.008 --> 04:14:56.617
LAURA: I know that.

04:14:56.617 --> 04:15:00.313
MATT: I need you to make a constitution saving
throw.

04:15:00.313 --> 04:15:04.104
SAM: There's no attack, there's no nothing?
There's no roll? I can't Cutting Words this?

04:15:04.104 --> 04:15:05.213
MATT: Nope.

04:15:05.213 --> 04:15:07.706
SAM: I can't Cutting Words?

04:15:07.706 --> 04:15:08.729
MATT: Yep.

04:15:08.729 --> 04:15:11.774
SAM: I can't Cutting Words the damage?

04:15:11.774 --> 04:15:15.438
MATT: It's not a weapon attack, unfortunately.

04:15:15.438 --> 04:15:16.592
SAM: Damn it.

04:15:16.592 --> 04:15:18.119
LAURA: 11.

04:15:18.119 --> 04:15:19.977
MATT: Nope.

04:15:19.977 --> 04:15:22.703
LAURA: Wait, 13.

04:15:22.703 --> 04:15:25.967
MATT: 13, no. All right, so--

04:15:25.967 --> 04:15:29.732
SAM: This is it. This is it.

04:15:29.732 --> 04:15:44.149
MARISHA: No.

04:15:44.219 --> 04:15:48.970
MATT: 45 plus 30. 75 points of necrotic damage.

04:15:49.039 --> 04:15:51.902
MARISHA: But you were at 76?

04:15:51.902 --> 04:15:58.583
TALIESIN, MARISHA, and SAM: Oh my god.

04:15:58.583 --> 04:16:06.021
MATT: All righty. You're at one hit point. As your
life force is suddenly sucked out of your body and

04:16:06.110 --> 04:16:12.035
you manage to capture what essence of your
existence still holds you aloft. Drifting forward,

04:16:12.035 --> 04:16:14.994
almost toppling over in your Fly spell.

04:16:14.994 --> 04:16:24.672
At this point, she looks at her finger,
frustrated. Glances at the rest of you, and looks

04:16:24.672 --> 04:16:30.138
forward at the orb and goes, "Come on, come on!"
At this point, the orb is now shimmering, and the

04:16:30.138 --> 04:16:37.706
blood is slowly spilling over the outside of the
dark onyx sphere. It begins to spin

04:16:37.706 --> 04:16:39.995
and spin and spin.

04:16:39.995 --> 04:16:41.778
LAURA: Am I close to it?

04:16:41.778 --> 04:16:51.466
MATT: You've moved up to this point. Now you're
right at the edge. The orb suddenly shrinks in a

04:16:51.466 --> 04:16:59.835
flash of an instant, becoming this tiny speck,
this little dark speck in the air, roughly the

04:16:59.835 --> 04:17:16.324
size of a dime. And that's it. She waits. "No, no,
no, no! It can't be too soon. Please! Please." And

04:17:16.324 --> 04:17:23.582
she falls to her knees. She's staring at this dark
speck in the air. The writhing walls of the room

04:17:23.582 --> 04:17:37.402
fall quiet again, all the bodies no longer moving.
You, floating through the air? Your flight ends.

04:17:37.402 --> 04:17:39.811
You immediately plummet.

04:17:39.811 --> 04:17:43.209
MARISHA: Can I cast Hold Person? On her?

04:17:43.209 --> 04:17:44.724
SAM: On her?

04:17:44.724 --> 04:17:45.771
MARISHA: Yes!

04:17:45.771 --> 04:17:47.534
MATT: If you want to. It's just going to paralyze
her.

04:17:47.534 --> 04:17:49.046
MARISHA: Oh, I can't hold her?

04:17:49.046 --> 04:18:00.380
MATT: No. So at that height, it's 40 feet. You
fall. You take 3d6 points of damage.

04:18:00.380 --> 04:18:05.188
LAURA: Can I roll for acrobatics? Maybe I can
catch myself.

04:18:05.188 --> 04:18:09.258
MATT: You know what? Roll acrobatics with
disadvantage.

04:18:09.258 --> 04:18:14.104
LAURA: Okay. I don't know where a d20 is.

04:18:14.104 --> 04:18:21.138
LIAM: 20, and? Six.

04:18:21.138 --> 04:18:24.797
LAURA: Acrobatics?

04:18:24.797 --> 04:18:28.151
LIAM and LAURA: 15.

04:18:28.151 --> 04:18:34.392
MATT: You take four points of fall damage. As you
slam down into the center of this.

04:18:34.392 --> 04:18:36.475
LAURA: And I'm unconscious.

04:18:36.475 --> 04:18:38.560
MATT: You're unconscious on the ground. (thud)

04:18:38.560 --> 04:18:41.451
LAURA: That's my first time I've ever been
unconscious.

04:18:41.451 --> 04:18:42.980
MARISHA: I thought you were going to die.

04:18:42.980 --> 04:18:45.015
TALIESIN: She's still connected to her rope,
though, isn't she?

04:18:45.015 --> 04:18:49.733
LAURA: No. I took out a fancy robe. I was going to
trap the globe.

04:18:49.733 --> 04:18:50.987
LIAM: Whose turn is it?

04:18:50.987 --> 04:18:53.452
ASHLEY: Can I get to her?

04:18:53.452 --> 04:18:56.691
MATT: You guys are up on this roof right now.

04:18:56.691 --> 04:19:00.379
LIAM: I'm leaping. If you let me leap, I'm going
to leap and take an acrobatics check.

04:19:00.379 --> 04:19:02.021
MATT: Acrobatics check, go for it.

04:19:02.021 --> 04:19:06.279
LIAM: 20. Natural fucking 20!

04:19:06.279 --> 04:19:07.483
MATT: Landing on your feet.

04:19:07.483 --> 04:19:08.728
TALIESIN: Parkour!

04:19:08.728 --> 04:19:11.860
LIAM: I have a potion with my sister's name
written on it, and it's going in her mouth.

04:19:11.860 --> 04:19:14.957
MATT: That's as far as you get on your movement,
right there.

04:19:14.957 --> 04:19:16.277
LIAM: All right.

04:19:16.277 --> 04:19:19.998
LAURA: All right. You can kill her!

04:19:19.998 --> 04:19:21.638
MATT: So you rush up.

04:19:21.638 --> 04:19:22.591
LIAM: I'm right there?

04:19:22.591 --> 04:19:25.386
MATT: That's your full movement to get to her. You
can't do anything else.

04:19:25.386 --> 04:19:27.477
LIAM: So I can't do anything else? I can't do a
bonus action? I can't do nothing.

04:19:27.477 --> 04:19:31.325
MATT: Well, you can do a bonus action, but it's an
action to feed a potion to somebody else.

04:19:31.325 --> 04:19:36.102
LIAM: Then I'm throwing a knife at Lady Briarwood,
which I can use a bonus action to attack her.

04:19:36.102 --> 04:19:39.547
MATT: On the ground, you can't see her. She's 40
feet up on the platform. She's completely out of

04:19:39.547 --> 04:19:45.600
your visual sight. You're down inside this hand
groove that's dug in the ground.

04:19:45.600 --> 04:19:47.939
LIAM: Fuck. All right, I'll hold.

04:19:47.939 --> 04:19:50.183
MATT: Who's up next? Who wants to go next?

04:19:50.183 --> 04:19:51.869
MARISHA: Pike!

04:19:51.869 --> 04:19:53.379
ASHLEY: Can I get to her?

04:19:53.379 --> 04:19:57.654
MATT: You're on top of the roof. You're going to
have to leap down to get to her. You're too far

04:19:57.654 --> 04:19:58.519
away.

04:19:58.519 --> 04:19:59.916
LIAM: She's got time.

04:19:59.916 --> 04:20:02.658
MATT: Actually, you could try a spell if you want
to.

04:20:02.658 --> 04:20:04.167
ASHLEY: Say again?

04:20:04.167 --> 04:20:08.738
MATT: You can try a spell if you want to. She's
about 50 feet from you, at an angle.

04:20:08.738 --> 04:20:15.247
ASHLEY: Okay. I'll do a Healing Word.

04:20:15.247 --> 04:20:26.433
MATT: Okay. As you pull up your holy symbol and
begin casting the spell, the divine energy seems

04:20:26.433 --> 04:20:30.739
to be pulled from your hand, and the spell has no
effect.

04:20:30.739 --> 04:20:32.871
SAM: So magic doesn't work?

04:20:32.871 --> 04:20:35.694
MARISHA: Is it because we're in this fucking
room?

04:20:35.694 --> 04:20:40.086
MATT: Do you want to stay where you are?

04:20:40.086 --> 04:20:44.652
LIAM: Come on down. Let's party.

04:20:44.652 --> 04:20:46.790
TRAVIS: I'll go next.

04:20:46.790 --> 04:20:53.839
MATT: Grog, you've gotten up now, with the rope,
to the top. Anybody else want to go?

04:20:53.839 --> 04:20:56.210
TALIESIN: I'll take a shot at Lady Briarwood,
since I'm up here.

04:20:56.210 --> 04:20:59.919
MATT: Go for it. And you aren't forgetting your Hex
damage on her, right?

04:20:59.919 --> 04:21:07.759
TALIESIN: I was. I forgot it on the last one. I
remembered that I forgot it. That's 24 to hit.

04:21:07.759 --> 04:21:09.756
MATT: That hits.

04:21:09.756 --> 04:21:19.636
TALIESIN: 13, 14, 15, 16-- 22 points of damage.

04:21:19.636 --> 04:21:22.190
MATT: How do you want to do this?

04:21:22.190 --> 04:21:24.352
SAM: You get to kill Lady Briarwood?

04:21:24.352 --> 04:21:27.556
LAURA: Do it with as little blood as possible. I'm
dead.

04:21:27.556 --> 04:21:29.670
MATT: You're unconscious.

04:21:29.670 --> 04:21:31.454
LAURA: I'm unconscious.

04:21:31.454 --> 04:21:33.830
TRAVIS: I think, if you kill her--

04:21:33.830 --> 04:21:36.644
TALIESIN: It's a little late.

04:21:36.644 --> 04:21:38.288
TRAVIS: Here comes Godzilla.

04:21:38.288 --> 04:21:45.639
MATT: The smoke billowing from your body, the
essence of this creature whispering in your ear,

04:21:45.639 --> 04:21:59.063
"Now. Do it. Do it!" Bad News, freshly repaired,
loaded.

04:21:59.063 --> 04:22:12.962
SAM: It's your birthright.

04:22:13.025 --> 04:22:22.194
TALIESIN: I'm going to take-- oh my god. I'm going
to take a shoulder shot on her right arm, and I'm

04:22:22.290 --> 04:22:27.505
going to try to cleave her right arm right off
with the shot and see if I can leave her

04:22:27.505 --> 04:22:29.133
unconscious.

04:22:29.133 --> 04:22:37.621
MATT: Okay. Roll damage. This is going to be a
constitution saving throw for her, if she can

04:22:37.670 --> 04:22:41.794
survive this wound as (gun blast)-- the right or
left arm, you said?

04:22:41.794 --> 04:22:42.916
TALIESIN: Right arm.

04:22:42.916 --> 04:22:48.830
MATT: Right arm. (gun blast) Blasts open, the bone
exposed. The arm spins off and clatters to the

04:22:48.830 --> 04:22:57.794
ground behind her. With that blast, she falls
backward onto the steps behind the platform.

04:22:57.794 --> 04:23:05.136
(impact noises) Falls off the steps, falls out of
sight behind the pillar. You don't even see where

04:23:05.136 --> 04:23:07.623
she is. She falls out of visual range.

04:23:07.623 --> 04:23:12.273
TRAVIS: We don't know if she's unconscious or
dead?

04:23:12.273 --> 04:23:13.374
MATT: You don't know.

04:23:13.374 --> 04:23:14.845
LIAM: I'm going to circle around to her right
now.

04:23:14.845 --> 04:23:15.986
LAURA: You're not going to try to heal me?

04:23:15.986 --> 04:23:17.538
LIAM: No, I know. Oh, shit.

04:23:17.538 --> 04:23:18.560
LAURA: You're not going to heal me?

04:23:18.560 --> 04:23:19.904
LIAM: Yes, I am. Fuck that.

04:23:19.904 --> 04:23:21.329
TRAVIS: Can I jump down, then?

04:23:21.329 --> 04:23:23.608
LIAM: I'm feeding a potion to my sister.

04:23:23.608 --> 04:23:24.783
MATT: Acrobatics check?

04:23:24.783 --> 04:23:27.663
LIAM: Thank you.

04:23:27.663 --> 04:23:29.816
TRAVIS: 18.

04:23:29.816 --> 04:23:43.158
MATT: 18, okay. You land and take ten points of
damage from the fall. All right.

04:23:43.158 --> 04:23:50.799
LAURA: Trinket's at the door going, (sad bear
noises).

04:23:50.799 --> 04:23:58.350
MATT: Trinket's trying to get in on this side. All
right, Percy's gone. Scanlan, do you want to try

04:23:58.350 --> 04:23:59.591
anything?

04:23:59.591 --> 04:24:06.016
SAM: I can move within 30 feet of Vax?

04:24:06.016 --> 04:24:09.083
MATT: You'd have to get on the ground to do it.

04:24:09.083 --> 04:24:10.517
SAM: All right.

04:24:10.517 --> 04:24:13.386
MATT: Okay, make an acrobatics check, yeah.

04:24:13.386 --> 04:24:18.221
SAM: 23.

04:24:18.221 --> 04:24:25.409
MATT: 23. Okay, so you only take three points of
damage from the fall. You don't fall prone. Okay,

04:24:25.409 --> 04:24:30.344
so going full movement from there, you can get
there. Grog, full movement. Where are you going?

04:24:30.344 --> 04:24:32.109
TRAVIS: I'd like to go straight for Vex.

04:24:32.109 --> 04:24:37.111
MATT: Vex? Okay, that would get you right there,
with your movement. And then Keyleth--

04:24:37.111 --> 04:24:40.403
MARISHA: I'm going for the black thing.

04:24:40.403 --> 04:24:47.346
MATT: You will have to go around and go up these
steps to get to it. With full double movement,

04:24:47.346 --> 04:24:54.163
that will put you about there. All right.

04:24:54.163 --> 04:24:56.264
LIAM: 4d4 plus four.

04:24:56.264 --> 04:25:05.187
MATT: Yeah, you pop off the vial, you go and pop
it into her mouth and take the vial away. There

04:25:05.187 --> 04:25:07.824
doesn't appear to be any effect.

04:25:07.824 --> 04:25:10.480
LIAM: With no talk of death saves at all?

04:25:10.480 --> 04:25:12.633
MARISHA: Get her out of the room. Get out of the
room!

04:25:12.633 --> 04:25:14.677
MATT: Make a death saving throw.

04:25:14.677 --> 04:25:17.556
LAURA: Get me out of here!

04:25:17.556 --> 04:25:22.585
LIAM: How do we get her-- Keyleth, we need
vines! 11, that's a success.

04:25:22.585 --> 04:25:24.124
MATT: You're okay for now.

04:25:24.124 --> 04:25:27.762
LIAM: Fuck that bitch! We need to get my sister
out of this room. Keyleth, can we use vines? What

04:25:27.762 --> 04:25:30.365
can we use to get my sister out of this room now?

04:25:30.365 --> 04:25:32.933
TRAVIS: I'll pick her up and start running towards
the door at the back of the room.

04:25:32.933 --> 04:25:34.820
MARISHA: What door is open?

04:25:34.820 --> 04:25:36.018
MATT: Neither.

04:25:36.018 --> 04:25:37.858
LIAM: We've got to get her up and out.

04:25:37.858 --> 04:25:41.567
TRAVIS: What do the doors look like?

04:25:41.567 --> 04:25:45.275
MATT: You can't tell from here. You're too far,
and the doors are on this side and this side, and

04:25:45.275 --> 04:25:46.276
they were closed.

04:25:46.276 --> 04:25:47.663
LIAM: Percival, do you have a rope?

04:25:47.663 --> 04:25:48.599
TALIESIN: She has the rope.

04:25:48.599 --> 04:25:52.625
LIAM: I pull the rope out from my sister's side
and I start lassoing it-- fuck that-- throw it up

04:25:52.625 --> 04:25:53.897
to Percival.

04:25:53.897 --> 04:25:55.167
MATT: Okay.

04:25:55.167 --> 04:25:56.228
TALIESIN: I grab it.

04:25:56.228 --> 04:26:00.076
MATT: It takes a couple of tries, but you manage
to get to the 40-foot top there. Make another

04:26:00.076 --> 04:26:01.294
death saving throw.

04:26:01.294 --> 04:26:04.374
LIAM: I'm tying it to my sister right now. Come
on.

04:26:04.374 --> 04:26:05.412
LAURA: Oh no.

04:26:05.412 --> 04:26:11.392
LIAM: Fail. I've tied it around my sister. Pike,
Percy, pull!

04:26:11.392 --> 04:26:18.720
TALIESIN: I am going to grab the rope, and I am
literally just going to jump off the side and I'm

04:26:18.720 --> 04:26:21.137
going to fling her up.

04:26:21.137 --> 04:26:25.140
SAM: You might miss, and hurt her.

04:26:25.140 --> 04:26:26.965
MARISHA: She's already dead!

04:26:26.965 --> 04:26:29.743
SAM: Wait, before you do this: have we tried a
Healing Word on her?

04:26:29.743 --> 04:26:30.858
TALIESIN and MARISHA: Yes.

04:26:30.858 --> 04:26:33.705
MATT: 17 points of damage from the fall.

04:26:33.705 --> 04:26:34.614
MARISHA: How many?

04:26:34.614 --> 04:26:35.583
MATT: 17 points.

04:26:35.583 --> 04:26:36.831
TALIESIN: Done.

04:26:36.831 --> 04:26:39.469
TRAVIS: I'll run to the door that's closest to
us.

04:26:39.469 --> 04:26:43.268
MATT: You manage to get her up to the top. Grog,
you're the one who has her right now?

04:26:43.268 --> 04:26:44.996
LIAM: Pike, please help her!

04:26:44.996 --> 04:26:50.918
ASHLEY: Okay. We've got to get her out of here, or
nothing's going to work, right?

04:26:50.918 --> 04:26:53.270
LIAM: Pull her out the door and heal her! It will
work.

04:26:53.270 --> 04:26:55.050
ASHLEY: Okay, let me try to pull her out the
door.

04:26:55.050 --> 04:26:56.367
MARISHA: Is she over?

04:26:56.367 --> 04:26:58.026
MATT: No, you pulled her up onto the roof.

04:26:58.026 --> 04:26:59.534
LAURA: It might work on the roof.

04:26:59.534 --> 04:27:01.560
ASHLEY: Okay, I'm going to try it up on the roof.

04:27:01.560 --> 04:27:02.818
MATT: Try on the roof.

04:27:02.818 --> 04:27:04.017
ASHLEY: Healing Word again.

04:27:04.017 --> 04:27:06.607
MARISHA: You're touching her. You're near her.

04:27:06.607 --> 04:27:09.329
ASHLEY: Wait, I'm touching her? Cure Wounds!

04:27:09.329 --> 04:27:12.905
MATT: Okay, you go for Cure Wounds. You pull up
your holy symbol and put your hand to her.

04:27:12.905 --> 04:27:14.692
Nothing's happening.

04:27:14.692 --> 04:27:16.166
(cursing)

04:27:16.166 --> 04:27:17.510
LIAM: Pull her out of here!

04:27:17.510 --> 04:27:18.817
MATT: Make another death saving throw.

04:27:18.817 --> 04:27:21.035
LAURA: (laughing) Oh my god, I'm going to die.

04:27:21.035 --> 04:27:22.193
MARISHA: You're not going to die.

04:27:22.193 --> 04:27:23.507
LIAM: 12. Save.

04:27:23.507 --> 04:27:24.482
MARISHA: You're saved!

04:27:24.482 --> 04:27:25.679
LIAM: Pull her out!

04:27:25.679 --> 04:27:26.626
LAURA: Oh god!

04:27:26.626 --> 04:27:27.788
MATT: What are you guys doing?

04:27:27.788 --> 04:27:28.836
SAM: Where is she?

04:27:28.836 --> 04:27:32.698
MATT: She's on top of the wall here. She's been
lifted out by Grog and Percival.

04:27:32.698 --> 04:27:35.051
LIAM: I'm running at the wall and I'm trying to
climb it, stupidly.

04:27:35.051 --> 04:27:39.095
MATT: Okay. Roll a climb check. Roll athletics.

04:27:39.095 --> 04:27:41.325
TRAVIS: What about the little penny? The dime?

04:27:41.325 --> 04:27:43.351
LIAM: 15.

04:27:43.351 --> 04:27:49.343
MATT: 15? (grunts) You get partway up. You climb
over bodies. You're using the bodies on the wall

04:27:49.343 --> 04:27:50.360
to climb up.

04:27:50.360 --> 04:27:52.878
MARISHA: Can I throw Vax something real quick? Can
I toss him something?

04:27:52.878 --> 04:27:54.879
MATT: You can move up and do it, yeah.

04:27:54.879 --> 04:27:59.536
MARISHA: No, before he runs that way. Can I toss
you the Immovable Rod?

04:27:59.536 --> 04:28:04.376
MATT: He doesn't even pay attention. He bolts
past, towards the wall. He's already out.

04:28:04.376 --> 04:28:06.886
MARISHA: Never mind. I'm trying to get to this
black hole.

04:28:06.886 --> 04:28:09.359
TALIESIN: Good call.

04:28:09.359 --> 04:28:11.449
MATT: You get up there.

04:28:11.449 --> 04:28:13.429
ASHLEY: Can I try Divine Intervention right now?

04:28:13.429 --> 04:28:15.374
MATT: That's your full turn. You want to do Divine
Intervention?

04:28:15.374 --> 04:28:16.819
ASHLEY: Yeah.

04:28:16.819 --> 04:28:18.223
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and roll.

04:28:18.223 --> 04:28:20.192
SAM: What is that?

04:28:20.192 --> 04:28:36.283
MATT: Roll a d10 and then another d10, and let me
know the numbers in succession.

04:28:36.283 --> 04:28:37.670
ASHLEY: 12.

04:28:37.670 --> 04:28:39.788
MATT: You are what level?

04:28:39.788 --> 04:28:41.078
ASHLEY: 11.

04:28:41.078 --> 04:28:43.524
MATT: Unfortunately, that just fails.

04:28:43.524 --> 04:28:51.802
LIAM: I scream at the top of my lungs, pull her
out of here! I'm still climbing dead bodies.

04:28:51.802 --> 04:28:59.508
TALIESIN: I've got hold of the rope and just
trying to yell, toss her off! Because that way

04:28:59.508 --> 04:29:01.493
we can see if we can counterweight her back down.

04:29:01.493 --> 04:29:05.388
TRAVIS: I'm at the top, so we can gently get her
down. I could jump down with you.

04:29:05.388 --> 04:29:06.414
LAURA: Okay.

04:29:06.414 --> 04:29:08.843
TRAVIS: I'll jump and hold her.

04:29:08.843 --> 04:29:10.928
TALIESIN: I'll ride the rope up.

04:29:10.928 --> 04:29:14.028
MATT: Okay. You're on the same side as them
jumping down now.

04:29:14.028 --> 04:29:16.252
TALIESIN: Oh, that's right. Never mind.

04:29:16.252 --> 04:29:17.790
MATT: They would come down to meet you.

04:29:17.790 --> 04:29:19.123
LIAM: Have I reached the top?

04:29:19.123 --> 04:29:21.941
MATT: We'll say now you've managed to climb up
towards the top.

04:29:21.941 --> 04:29:27.204
LIAM: I want to pick up Pike under my arm like a
fucking football and run forward after my sister.

04:29:27.204 --> 04:29:29.124
MATT: You grab her and bolt off the side.

04:29:29.124 --> 04:29:35.032
TRAVIS: Once we hit the ground-- we're outside of
the room, right? Should we try to heal her? I've

04:29:35.032 --> 04:29:36.136
got a common.

04:29:36.136 --> 04:29:40.378
MATT: There's going to be 14 points of fall damage
to you as you land because right now you're not

04:29:40.378 --> 04:29:44.139
carefully landing. This is just clutching her and
jumping off. You, make an acrobatics check.

04:29:44.139 --> 04:29:48.494
LIAM: That's a 20.

04:29:48.494 --> 04:29:54.608
MATT: 20? Okay. You manage to take only two damage
from the fall. Make another death saving throw.

04:29:54.608 --> 04:29:58.170
TALIESIN: I believe in you!

04:29:58.170 --> 04:30:00.309
LAURA: Save. I've only failed one.

04:30:00.309 --> 04:30:05.198
LIAM: I'm planting Pike's glowing form right down
on my sister's chest.

04:30:05.198 --> 04:30:07.954
TRAVIS: Can I put a common? I have a common.

04:30:07.954 --> 04:30:13.713
LIAM: You did succeed three times.

04:30:13.713 --> 04:30:15.340
TALIESIN: She succeeded three times.

04:30:15.340 --> 04:30:17.966
MATT: Three times. No, you succeeded--

04:30:17.966 --> 04:30:18.945
SAM: Twice.

04:30:18.945 --> 04:30:19.920
LAURA: Three times.

04:30:19.920 --> 04:30:26.051
MATT: Three times. Yeah, so with that, as you're
carrying her there, there's a moment where all of

04:30:26.051 --> 04:30:33.667
a sudden, Vex's eyes open and (deep breath). Vex
is sitting there, looking around, confused,

04:30:33.667 --> 04:30:38.696
catching her breath in Grog's arms as he's bolting
down the steps of the ziggurat.

04:30:38.696 --> 04:30:47.710
LAURA: Grog, you smell terrible. (chuckles
weakly)

04:30:47.710 --> 04:30:49.820
SAM: Maybe we should get out of here.

04:30:49.820 --> 04:30:51.409
TRAVIS: Do something to that little ball.

04:30:51.409 --> 04:31:00.068
MARISHA: I'm alone with the little ball, aren't I?
Okay, I'm going to go up to it. Can I tell any

04:31:00.068 --> 04:31:03.441
type of magical properties from it from looking at
it?

04:31:03.441 --> 04:31:04.978
MATT: Make an arcana check.

04:31:04.978 --> 04:31:10.269
MARISHA: Oh, Jesus. Oh, that's good! 19 total?

04:31:10.269 --> 04:31:18.415
MATT: 19 total. You have no idea what this is. You
haven't seen something like this before. You

04:31:18.415 --> 04:31:24.077
inspect it very closely, and it's literally like
the sphere has been shrunk to this size. You look

04:31:24.077 --> 04:31:26.776
very closely and it looks like it's spinning
impossibly fast in place.

04:31:26.776 --> 04:31:28.214
TRAVIS: Who's still in there?

04:31:28.214 --> 04:31:31.328
SAM: I'm in there. I go up there, too.

04:31:31.328 --> 04:31:33.439
TRAVIS: Check on Lady Shithead.

04:31:33.439 --> 04:31:41.816
SAM: Yeah? Okay, I'm going to turn back and go to
check out Lady Shithead. I don't know why I'm

04:31:41.816 --> 04:31:43.466
still in this room. We should get out of here.

04:31:43.466 --> 04:31:46.550
TALIESIN: I'm going to try and open the doors from
that side to see if there's any way to open them.

04:31:46.550 --> 04:31:48.426
MATT: Make a strength check.

04:31:48.426 --> 04:31:53.441
MARISHA: What is the net of dead bodies doing? Are
they limp?

04:31:53.441 --> 04:31:56.284
MATT: They're just limp. Still in the tapestry,
arms fallen.

04:31:56.284 --> 04:32:00.467
TALIESIN: 11.

04:32:00.467 --> 04:32:03.443
MATT: 11? Doors aren't budging.

04:32:03.443 --> 04:32:05.949
TRAVIS: Here, you take your sister. I'll go back
to the doors.

04:32:05.949 --> 04:32:07.466
LIAM: All right.

04:32:07.466 --> 04:32:09.579
TRAVIS: I go back to the doors and try the doors.

04:32:09.579 --> 04:32:12.170
MATT: Okay. Strength check.

04:32:12.170 --> 04:32:15.227
ASHLEY: Can I try to Cure Wounds again, on Vex?

04:32:15.227 --> 04:32:25.233
MATT: Okay. You run up to Vex as she's in Vax's
arms. Once again, the spell slot is expended, but

04:32:25.233 --> 04:32:31.050
no magic seems to appear. There is some sort of
blockage or void of magic use in this vicinity.

04:32:31.050 --> 04:32:33.440
MARISHA: Even outside of this building?

04:32:33.440 --> 04:32:34.553
TRAVIS: 19.

04:32:34.553 --> 04:32:41.045
MATT: 19? (impact noise) The doors slam open from
the force of Grog's foot, opening the passageway

04:32:41.045 --> 04:32:42.695
inside the room.

04:32:42.695 --> 04:32:44.398
MARISHA: Would my Sunbeam still be up?

04:32:44.398 --> 04:32:46.735
MATT: No, that's passed, for now.

04:32:46.735 --> 04:32:50.011
TRAVIS: Can I make my way over to Scanlan to go
check on Lady Briarwood?

04:32:50.011 --> 04:32:52.923
MATT: Sure. You eventually make your way there at
a full run. You run around the corner and you can

04:32:52.923 --> 04:32:53.956
see her.

04:32:53.956 --> 04:32:54.994
SAM: Alive? Dead?

04:32:54.994 --> 04:33:04.259
MATT: She is on the ground, unconscious, sitting
in this carved hand symbol in the ground.

04:33:04.259 --> 04:33:10.279
SAM: Do we want this girl alive for some reason? I
can't move her.

04:33:10.279 --> 04:33:15.342
TRAVIS: We need to figure out what we're doing
with the little black ball of universal death.

04:33:15.342 --> 04:33:16.774
TALIESIN: Let's get her out of there.

04:33:16.774 --> 04:33:18.427
SAM: Let's just get us out of here.

04:33:18.427 --> 04:33:19.756
TRAVIS: Could we just leave it?

04:33:19.756 --> 04:33:21.850
LAURA: No. Can you put it in a vial?

04:33:21.850 --> 04:33:23.547
SAM: Put it in a vial?

04:33:23.547 --> 04:33:29.687
MARISHA: I pull out a piece of that green glass
that we took from before.

04:33:29.687 --> 04:33:33.137
SAM: Okay, that's smart.

04:33:33.137 --> 04:33:34.600
TRAVIS: Give it a poke.

04:33:34.600 --> 04:33:36.215
MARISHA: I'm going to jam it into it.

04:33:36.215 --> 04:33:37.546
MATT: Okay.

04:33:37.546 --> 04:33:38.757
LAURA: Oh god.

04:33:38.757 --> 04:33:41.921
SAM: Just hit the black hole.

04:33:41.921 --> 04:33:50.037
MATT: Make a strength saving throw.

04:33:50.037 --> 04:33:51.645
TALIESIN: Whoa!

04:33:51.645 --> 04:33:53.450
MARISHA: That's a natural 20.

04:33:53.450 --> 04:34:03.066
MATT: As you take the glass and jam it in there,
the glass, in what seems almost like slow-mo,

04:34:03.066 --> 04:34:11.070
seems to crackle and shatter like brittle stone,
and immediately vanish into the darkness. As your

04:34:11.070 --> 04:34:17.122
hand gets to that point of no resistance, you feel
this immediate, extremely strong suction begin to

04:34:17.122 --> 04:34:27.803
pull towards your hand, and you yank back with all
your might, suffering 18 points of damage as you

04:34:27.803 --> 04:34:32.013
(grunts) pull away from this small spinning orb.

04:34:32.013 --> 04:34:34.210
SAM: Okay, so maybe we don't touch the orb
anymore.

04:34:34.210 --> 04:34:35.721
LAURA: Don't touch the orb.

04:34:35.721 --> 04:34:38.723
MARISHA: Nothing happened to it? Still just--

04:34:38.723 --> 04:34:41.304
MATT: Still just sitting there. A little speck in
space.

04:34:41.304 --> 04:34:44.590
TALIESIN: We're not leaving this thing.

04:34:44.590 --> 04:34:46.719
MARISHA and SAM: What do you mean we're not
leaving it?!

04:34:46.719 --> 04:34:48.752
SAM: What are we going to do to it?

04:34:48.752 --> 04:34:50.075
MARISHA: It's indestructible.

04:34:50.075 --> 04:34:54.555
TRAVIS: We're obviously not equipped. I'll grab
Lady Briarwood and drag her out of the room

04:34:54.555 --> 04:34:55.704
towards the doors.

04:34:55.704 --> 04:34:56.541
MATT: Okay.

04:34:56.541 --> 04:34:59.285
SAM: Wait, what's that-- the horn of--

04:34:59.285 --> 04:35:00.580
TRAVIS: Orcus?

04:35:00.580 --> 04:35:03.388
SAM: The Horn of Orcus? Can that counter-- we
don't have it.

04:35:03.388 --> 04:35:06.623
LAURA: You want to put the two bad things
together?

04:35:06.623 --> 04:35:09.194
SAM: Yeah, maybe they'll become a good thing.

04:35:09.194 --> 04:35:10.211
LAURA: No.

04:35:10.211 --> 04:35:10.874
SAM: No?

04:35:10.874 --> 04:35:12.060
LAURA: Two negatives make a positive?

04:35:12.060 --> 04:35:14.372
SAM: That's what I say to all my women.

04:35:14.372 --> 04:35:21.126
LIAM: I don't know what's going on, but I've got
her and I'm hugging her from behind and turning my

04:35:21.126 --> 04:35:24.485
back towards whatever is in that room. I don't
know what's going on.

04:35:24.485 --> 04:35:25.859
MATT: Okay.

04:35:25.859 --> 04:35:31.139
MARISHA: I can try and tear this whole building
down. I still have my elemental shape. I can go

04:35:31.139 --> 04:35:33.295
earth elemental and start ripping this thing
apart.

04:35:33.295 --> 04:35:35.353
TRAVIS: Bury it like the pharaohs of old?

04:35:35.353 --> 04:35:42.295
SAM: Sure. Why not? Let's get out of here. Do you
want to take Briarwood with us, or bury her in the

04:35:42.295 --> 04:35:43.626
rubble?

04:35:43.626 --> 04:35:45.339
TRAVIS: We can't kill her in here.

04:35:45.339 --> 04:35:49.004
TALIESIN: I'm afraid of what blood will do to that
thing.

04:35:49.004 --> 04:35:51.413
TRAVIS: She kept talking about a sacrifice. We
can't kill her.

04:35:51.413 --> 04:35:53.509
SAM: You think she was going to jump into that
orb?

04:35:53.509 --> 04:35:57.321
TRAVIS: I think she understood she had to give a
life for it.

04:35:57.321 --> 04:35:59.886
MARISHA: I think something was going to come
through that orb.

04:35:59.886 --> 04:36:00.977
LAURA: Yeah.

04:36:00.977 --> 04:36:05.411
LIAM: Let's drag her out of here. Percy, you can
shoot her in the head a hundred yards from here.

04:36:05.411 --> 04:36:08.307
TRAVIS: And then you can bury it once we're out of
the way.

04:36:08.307 --> 04:36:10.127
MARISHA: Okay.

04:36:10.127 --> 04:36:13.099
TRAVIS: I drag her out of the room and toward the
steps.

04:36:13.099 --> 04:36:17.900
MATT: Okay. As you're holding her in your arms,
what's everyone doing?

04:36:17.900 --> 04:36:19.546
MARISHA: Everyone, get out.

04:36:19.546 --> 04:36:22.545
LIAM: I'm picking up my sister and lurching after
Grog.

04:36:22.545 --> 04:36:23.723
LAURA: I can walk.

04:36:23.723 --> 04:36:25.701
LIAM: I'm picking you up, and I'm lurching after
Grog!

04:36:25.701 --> 04:36:31.442
MATT: So as Grog rushes down the steps of the
ziggurat, clutching the unconscious and bleeding

04:36:31.442 --> 04:36:39.084
body of Lady Delilah Briarwood. Vax rushing
behind, carrying the barely-conscious, limp body

04:36:39.084 --> 04:36:46.592
of Vex'ahlia, the rest of you racing out. You,
your hand bloodied from the terrible force of

04:36:46.592 --> 04:36:52.600
whatever that was. You go charging down the steps
of the ziggurat. Is anyone taking Cassandra, or

04:36:52.600 --> 04:36:53.652
are you leaving her behind?

04:36:53.652 --> 04:36:54.884
TALIESIN: I'm taking Cassandra.

04:36:54.884 --> 04:36:57.792
MATT: You reach over and pick up Cassandra, put
her over your shoulder, and you begin racing down

04:36:57.792 --> 04:36:59.251
the front of the ziggurat steps.

04:36:59.251 --> 04:37:01.449
MARISHA: Am I tearing this place down?

04:37:01.449 --> 04:37:03.215
TRAVIS: Not yet. Not until we're out of here.

04:37:03.215 --> 04:37:05.552
MARISHA: I'll stay behind.

04:37:05.552 --> 04:37:06.829
MATT: You stay behind?

04:37:06.829 --> 04:37:09.234
TRAVIS: Do you have to be there to do it?

04:37:09.234 --> 04:37:12.397
MARISHA: Being an earth elemental and ripping it
apart.

04:37:12.397 --> 04:37:13.759
LIAM: She's doing it physically.

04:37:13.759 --> 04:37:16.287
TRAVIS: Well, let's all get to the point where
it's not going to collapse on us.

04:37:16.287 --> 04:37:19.676
TALIESIN: Why don't we just open up the acid and
let it pour down in there.

04:37:19.676 --> 04:37:21.011
SAM: Where is that?

04:37:21.011 --> 04:37:22.336
LAURA: That's so far away.

04:37:22.336 --> 04:37:26.569
TALIESIN: We have to go that way, anyway. Once we
get there, let's open the spigot, point it towards

04:37:26.569 --> 04:37:28.326
the doors, and let it do its work.

04:37:28.326 --> 04:37:32.032
MARISHA: I don't know if that's enough acid to
take down and destroy a thing.

04:37:32.032 --> 04:37:36.398
LAURA: Might as well try it. Do we have any acid?
You have acid, can we pour it?

04:37:36.398 --> 04:37:38.068
TRAVIS: It's like three little acid vials.

04:37:38.068 --> 04:37:39.951
LIAM: We've got acid from a tube.

04:37:39.951 --> 04:37:44.498
SAM: Why don't we just seal up the hole and get
out of here?

04:37:44.498 --> 04:37:49.505
LIAM: Let's get out of here. Keyleth, it's a good
idea. Destroy the temple.

04:37:49.505 --> 04:37:54.477
TALIESIN: Do some damage to the temple, and then
once we're all the way out, we'll open the acid.

04:37:54.477 --> 04:37:57.877
MARISHA: Do we want to leave a spinning black hole
of death under the city?

04:37:57.877 --> 04:38:03.029
TALIESIN: It could just swallow the entire city
and everybody could die. This is my problem, at

04:38:03.029 --> 04:38:04.399
the moment.

04:38:04.399 --> 04:38:09.073
MARISHA: You guys go. I'm going to tear it down.
I'll be okay. I'll meet you there.

04:38:09.073 --> 04:38:11.152
LAURA: What?

04:38:11.152 --> 04:38:12.452
ASHLEY: No.

04:38:12.452 --> 04:38:15.160
TALIESIN: She can earth shape. She'll be fine.

04:38:15.160 --> 04:38:24.328
LIAM: I push my sister into Grog's massive arms
because he can hold fucking five people, and I

04:38:24.328 --> 04:38:26.346
start running back towards the ziggurat.

04:38:26.346 --> 04:38:27.577
MATT: Okay.

04:38:27.577 --> 04:38:29.664
LAURA: I'm laying on top of Lady Briarwood right
now.

04:38:29.664 --> 04:38:30.828
LIAM: Yes. Yes, you are.

04:38:30.828 --> 04:38:32.192
LAURA: Great.

04:38:32.192 --> 04:38:34.757
TALIESIN: 70 percent of her, at the very least.

04:38:34.757 --> 04:38:38.041
MARISHA: I stand at the top of the temple, and I
wait to see them go out of range.

04:38:38.041 --> 04:38:44.031
MATT: Okay. They all begin to step down the bottom
of the stairs, except for Vax, who begins running

04:38:44.031 --> 04:38:45.466
back up the steps towards you.

04:38:45.466 --> 04:38:52.750
MARISHA: Vax, go. No. Go.

04:38:52.750 --> 04:38:55.123
LIAM: Whatever you're going to do, just fucking do
it.

04:38:55.123 --> 04:39:02.722
MARISHA: I concentrate for a minute, and I go into
the ground.

04:39:02.722 --> 04:39:08.979
MATT: As you focus your attention towards your
earthen core and triggering the transformation

04:39:08.979 --> 04:39:12.735
effect, nothing happens.

04:39:12.735 --> 04:39:14.248
LAURA: Magic. It kills all magic!

04:39:14.248 --> 04:39:15.361
MARISHA: Even Beast Shape?

04:39:15.361 --> 04:39:16.739
MATT: It's a magical transformation.

04:39:16.739 --> 04:39:20.089
MARISHA: Never mind! Run!

04:39:20.089 --> 04:39:21.531
(laughter)

04:39:21.531 --> 04:39:22.747
MARISHA: Fuck it! Run.

04:39:22.747 --> 04:39:23.588
TRAVIS: We all leave.

04:39:23.588 --> 04:39:25.763
LAURA: Can you try pouring acid on the thingy?

04:39:25.763 --> 04:39:27.969
TALIESIN: I'm going to do it once we're out. We're
just going to go.

04:39:27.969 --> 04:39:30.969
MATT: As Vox Machina charges down the front of the
steps of the ziggurat,

04:39:30.969 --> 04:39:33.419
we'll call that for the night.

04:39:33.419 --> 04:39:35.987
(groaning)

04:39:35.987 --> 04:39:37.978
LAURA: And I rolled a one right as that final.

04:39:37.978 --> 04:39:39.416
LIAM: For no reason.

04:39:39.416 --> 04:39:40.821
SAM: We killed the Briarwoods.

04:39:40.821 --> 04:39:42.234
TALIESIN: Well, one and a half of them.

04:39:42.234 --> 04:39:44.936
SAM: We didn't die. Yet.

04:39:44.936 --> 04:39:46.073
LAURA and MARISHA: Oh my god.

04:39:46.073 --> 04:39:51.593
LAURA: I can't believe I almost died again from
that damn death ray!

04:39:51.593 --> 04:39:53.713
MARISHA: By one point.

04:39:53.713 --> 04:39:58.943
TRAVIS: So if you had rolled 76 points of necrotic
damage?

04:39:58.943 --> 04:40:01.799
MATT: She'd have been dead instantly and then come
back as a zombie in the next round.

04:40:01.799 --> 04:40:03.121
MARISHA: And would become what?

04:40:03.121 --> 04:40:05.867
LAURA: If I hadn't taken that potion right before
I leapt off--

04:40:05.867 --> 04:40:07.078
MATT: You would have been dead.

04:40:07.078 --> 04:40:10.091
MARISHA: Thank god you took that fucking potion!

04:40:10.091 --> 04:40:13.624
MATT: That went a little longer than anticipated.

04:40:13.624 --> 04:40:14.963
LIAM: You're a bad man!

04:40:14.963 --> 04:41:00.788
[no audio]

04:41:00.788 --> 04:41:02.533
(laughter)

04:41:02.533 --> 04:41:04.097
MARISHA: I think Pike's playlist is up right now.

04:41:04.097 --> 04:41:05.465
TALIESIN: Hey!

04:41:05.465 --> 04:41:08.841
SAM: Hey, Percy? How much does that comic cost?

04:41:08.841 --> 04:41:10.540
TALIESIN: That comic is--

04:41:10.540 --> 04:41:11.637
SAM: Free.

04:41:11.637 --> 04:41:14.980
TALIESIN: Was free. After this weekend, it's one
healing potion.

04:41:14.980 --> 04:41:17.418
MARISHA: That won't work.

04:41:17.418 --> 04:41:19.673
TALIESIN: Goddamn it.

04:41:19.673 --> 04:41:21.230
LAURA: A bunch of wasted healing potions.

04:41:21.230 --> 04:41:24.641
MATT: Okay, guys. Thank you all so much for your
patience, for your diligence, for watching this

04:41:24.641 --> 04:41:25.988
extremely--

04:41:25.988 --> 04:41:26.920
LAURA: Long.

04:41:26.920 --> 04:41:30.479
MATT: Long, dark episode. We'll see you next week.
Is it Thursday yet?

04:41:30.479 --> 04:41:32.452
LIAM: (mock-crying) Is it Thursday yet?

04:41:32.452 --> 04:41:33.886
TALIESIN: Oh, god.
