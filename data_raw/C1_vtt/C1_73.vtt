00:00:00.535 --> 00:00:05.974
MATT: (as Victor) Welcome to tonight's episode of
Critical Role, our Halloween edition. Where a

00:00:05.974 --> 00:00:15.507
bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and
play Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons. Hi. Tonight we will

00:00:15.507 --> 00:00:21.234
astound you with spooky tales. I don't know what's
going to happen as we are just going to continue

00:00:21.234 --> 00:00:26.139
the game that we normally play. Welcome, I'm
Matthew Mercer, dungeon master.

00:00:26.139 --> 00:00:29.592
(laughter)

00:00:29.592 --> 00:00:33.943
MATT: Those who don't recognise my costume, you're
really confused, especially if this is your first

00:00:33.943 --> 00:00:38.515
time tuning in. Sorry. (normal voice) I am not
dungeon mastering like that for the rest of the

00:00:38.515 --> 00:00:40.988
evening because I will have to run into traffic
after an hour.

00:00:40.988 --> 00:00:45.225
(cheering)

00:00:45.225 --> 00:00:50.236
MATT: Guys, I want to give a quick thank you to
Amazon for delaying all my orders, making me put

00:00:50.236 --> 00:00:55.765
my costume together last minute out of shit I
found at Home Depot. So, thanks, Amazon. It's

00:00:55.765 --> 00:01:00.516
fantastic, I appreciate it. All right, anyway. I
guess we should go through everyone else's to see

00:01:00.516 --> 00:01:05.057
the magnificent costumes around us. Let's go and
start over here with our fantastic--

00:01:05.057 --> 00:01:18.748
SAM: I am Hotis! The rakshasa. And I cannot speak
with my mouth hole. (growls)

00:01:18.748 --> 00:01:25.070
TALIESIN: I have Clarota, but the mask is
currently on its way here because I didn't have

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:29.099
nearly enough coffee. So on the break there will
be a giant squiddy mask that is terrible, just

00:01:29.099 --> 00:01:30.869
terrible. It's the worst thing.

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:38.288
MARISHA: Half Clarota! I am Doctor Anna Ripley,
from Wildemount.

00:01:38.288 --> 00:01:40.598
TRAVIS: You suck, Ripley!

00:01:40.598 --> 00:01:46.762
MARISHA: This is very heavy. This is a bludgeoning
weapon, it is not a piercing weapon. It is a

00:01:46.762 --> 00:01:58.918
bludgeoning weapon. Right hand to the Briarwoods.
And uber Percy fangirl. That's me. Cheers.

00:01:58.918 --> 00:02:04.608
LAURA: Ooh! Nice, nice!

00:02:04.608 --> 00:02:06.842
MATT: All right, Liam.

00:02:06.842 --> 00:02:11.696
LIAM: Hi, Hi. I am Tyriok. I make maps.

00:02:11.696 --> 00:02:13.969
SAM: Why are you having trouble picking that up?

00:02:13.969 --> 00:02:20.279
LIAM: Oh, well. I was turned to stone recently and
I don't have two arms anymore. I have one. I can

00:02:20.279 --> 00:02:32.471
still roll dice though and I have maps and I have
a compass and I am the least dangerous person at

00:02:32.471 --> 00:02:40.021
the tables. I'm not level one in anything, really,
except maps. I'm level 15 in maps. I'm just happy

00:02:40.021 --> 00:02:43.144
to be here and be alive. Mostly.

00:02:43.144 --> 00:02:45.315
LAURA: We've been opening doors for him all night.

00:02:45.315 --> 00:02:48.894
MATT: Thank you, Liam. That's awesome. Laura!

00:02:48.894 --> 00:02:55.528
LAURA: I'm Lady Briarwood. Here with the man I
broke the world for.

00:02:55.528 --> 00:02:57.280
TRAVIS: You broke it for me, baby.

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:02.845
LAURA: That's right. You should say who you are.

00:03:02.845 --> 00:03:05.147
TRAVIS: Oh right. I'm Lord Briarwood.

00:03:05.147 --> 00:03:06.215
LAURA: Nice!

00:03:06.215 --> 00:03:11.586
TRAVIS: Yeah. Undead. Betrothed.

00:03:11.586 --> 00:03:14.246
LAURA: That's right. More than betrothed.

00:03:14.246 --> 00:03:17.583
LIAM: Do you know, people who are in love high
five?

00:03:17.583 --> 00:03:23.819
TRAVIS: We be representing the dead motherfuckers
in this game.

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:25.315
LAURA: I'm not dead.

00:03:25.315 --> 00:03:26.776
TRAVIS: Are you not?

00:03:26.776 --> 00:03:27.762
LAURA: No, man.

00:03:27.762 --> 00:03:29.486
LIAM and LAURA: Just inside.

00:03:29.486 --> 00:03:31.340
MARISHA: Actually, me and Travis are the only dead
ones.

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:34.315
LAURA: I guess. Well, I am dead. No, I am dead.

00:03:34.315 --> 00:03:37.704
LIAM: Currently dead, but you weren't undead.

00:03:37.704 --> 00:03:39.259
LAURA: Exactly. I misunderstood.

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:45.014
MATT: You're both dead. You're destroyed. You're
dead. You're somewhere--

00:03:45.014 --> 00:03:47.322
SAM: I'm in another plane of existence probably.

00:03:47.322 --> 00:03:49.922
MATT: Yeah, you're having a real rough week right
now is what you're having.

00:03:49.922 --> 00:03:51.076
LIAM: My arm is dead.

00:03:51.076 --> 00:03:52.865
LAURA: You're the only person alive.

00:03:52.865 --> 00:03:53.982
LIAM: Cheers.

00:03:53.982 --> 00:03:56.664
LAURA: And you of course.

00:03:56.664 --> 00:03:58.196
MATT: (as Victor) Parts of me.

00:03:58.196 --> 00:04:02.062
(laughter and cheering)

00:04:02.062 --> 00:04:04.399
MATT: (as Victor) What?

00:04:04.399 --> 00:04:05.621
LAURA: Cheers, Victor!

00:04:05.621 --> 00:04:07.957
TRAVIS: Yeah, cheers. Salut, bitches!

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:09.041
(cheering)

00:04:09.041 --> 00:04:11.214
ALL: Happy Halloween!

00:04:11.214 --> 00:04:18.757
(laughter)

00:04:18.757 --> 00:04:21.892
TRAVIS: I can't breathe.

00:04:21.892 --> 00:04:23.275
LIAM: So that's it. That's the show.

00:04:23.275 --> 00:04:27.917
MATT: Yeah. Thanks guys, thanks for coming. We
shall get into our announcements for the evening.

00:04:27.917 --> 00:04:35.814
I need my hand to do that. This is, by the way,
pre-finger loss Victor. As I know there will be

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:37.644
some purists out there like, why does he
have all his fingers on his right hand? Matt,

00:04:37.644 --> 00:04:39.274
you're so inaccurate to your own character.

00:04:39.274 --> 00:04:40.491
TRAVIS: Wow.

00:04:40.491 --> 00:04:44.311
MATT: All right, so first and foremost, tonight's
episode is sponsored by Loot Crate.

00:04:44.311 --> 00:04:45.254
TRAVIS: Loot Crate!

00:04:45.254 --> 00:04:47.121
(cheering)

00:04:47.121 --> 00:04:49.153
LAURA: Get your maps off the table, Tyriok.

00:04:49.153 --> 00:04:50.430
LIAM: Sorry.

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:54.708
MATT: We've got an unboxing to do here with their
last theme here. But before we get to that, Sam

00:04:54.769 --> 00:04:55.778
did you want to--

00:04:55.778 --> 00:05:04.088
SAM: I wanted to say guys that this month's theme
for Loot Crate is magic. And I don't have much

00:05:04.088 --> 00:05:09.890
planned for tonight, but I did learn a magic
trick. I'm going to do a magic trick. It's my

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:14.628
first magic trick I've ever done. And I don't have
a deck of cards at home, so I'm going to use spell

00:05:14.628 --> 00:05:19.115
cards instead. I'm going to give it a little
shuffle here. Oh, hey there, cowboy.

00:05:19.115 --> 00:05:21.385
TRAVIS: Oh, please let something come out of your
mouth.

00:05:21.385 --> 00:05:24.166
SAM: Taliesin, can you give it a
shuffle?

00:05:24.166 --> 00:05:27.252
TALIESIN: I'll give it a shuffle. Liam, do you
want to shuffle?

00:05:27.252 --> 00:05:30.934
LIAM: Sure, I've got it. We got 30 minutes,
right?

00:05:30.934 --> 00:05:42.058
SAM: Get ready for November's enchanting theme:
Magical! We've cast a powerful, ancient spell to

00:05:42.104 --> 00:05:49.531
deliver you this 100% exclusive crate. Featuring
bewitching items from Doctor Strange, Fantastic

00:05:49.531 --> 00:05:59.378
Beasts and Where to Find Them, Big Trouble in
Little China. And more! Use the promo link:

00:05:59.378 --> 00:06:03.399
lootcrate.com/criticalrole.

00:06:03.399 --> 00:06:07.974
MATT: Marvel as Sam slowly becomes Bill Cosby.
(Cosby impression) You see!

00:06:07.974 --> 00:06:10.851
LIAM: No, no, no, you can't take that back!

00:06:10.851 --> 00:06:19.920
SAM: I'm going to show Taliesin that these are, in
fact, randomly shuffled cards. Can you please give

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:24.634
the card deck a little cut anywhere you'd like.
I'm going to look at this half of the card deck

00:06:24.634 --> 00:06:32.572
and it'll tell me what's in the other half of the
card deck. Okay. I know, Taliesin, by looking at

00:06:32.572 --> 00:06:37.348
that, that the fourth card down is See
Invisibility.

00:06:37.348 --> 00:06:39.916
TALIESIN: The fourth card down.

00:06:39.916 --> 00:06:42.580
SAM: The fourth card down is See Invisibility.

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:45.961
TALIESIN: So, this card here will be--

00:06:45.961 --> 00:06:47.457
SAM: Will be See Invisibility!

00:06:47.457 --> 00:06:52.160
TALIESIN: It's like Nicholas Cage as a cat. It is,
in fact, See Invisibility!

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:55.615
(cheering)

00:06:55.615 --> 00:07:01.369
SAM: The most magical part of this trick is is
that it makes me a quadruple threat: Actor!

00:07:01.369 --> 00:07:09.439
Singer! Professional Lover of Ladies! And now,
Professional Magician. Thank you, Loot Crate.

00:07:09.439 --> 00:07:11.898
(cheering)

00:07:11.898 --> 00:07:17.225
TALIESIN: Remarkable Nicholas Cage impersonator,
too, it's really amazing.

00:07:17.225 --> 00:07:19.694
SAM: My mouth hurts so much right now.

00:07:19.694 --> 00:07:31.106
MATT: Thank you, Sam. Thank you, Loot Crate! Yeah,
open your Loot Crates.

00:07:31.106 --> 00:07:35.024
LAURA: These are from October. These are not the
current ones.

00:07:35.024 --> 00:07:36.575
TALIESIN: These are not the magic theme.

00:07:36.575 --> 00:07:38.249
MARISHA: No, it's the horror theme.

00:07:38.249 --> 00:07:40.894
SAM: This is what everyone should be getting this
month.

00:07:40.894 --> 00:07:47.346
LAURA: Okay, that's the coolest.

00:07:47.346 --> 00:07:49.148
TRAVIS: Are those Freddy Kruger chopsticks?

00:07:49.148 --> 00:07:50.417
LAURA: Yes, I think.

00:07:50.417 --> 00:07:51.698
MATT: That's pretty badass.

00:07:51.698 --> 00:07:53.842
MARISHA: Little chibi Leatherface!

00:07:53.842 --> 00:07:59.585
TRAVIS: Of all the things you thought could never
be cute. Leatherface.

00:07:59.585 --> 00:08:00.784
MARISHA: Little Leatherface.

00:08:00.784 --> 00:08:02.987
LAURA: I have to see if these are actually usable
or not.

00:08:02.987 --> 00:08:04.794
MATT: Negan shirt.

00:08:04.794 --> 00:08:06.194
LIAM: Got it! It's off!

00:08:06.194 --> 00:08:08.412
MATT: Well done, Liam, well done.

00:08:08.412 --> 00:08:09.886
TRAVIS: Camp Crystal Lake.

00:08:09.886 --> 00:08:13.968
SAM: Ooh, a little pennant. My son will love that,
big fan of the movie.

00:08:13.968 --> 00:08:16.381
LIAM: I'm going to wear this for my kids all the
time.

00:08:16.381 --> 00:08:18.159
MATT: Regrettable Supervillains.

00:08:18.159 --> 00:08:24.321
TALIESIN: Too soon, guys, too soon. Just too
soon.

00:08:24.321 --> 00:08:34.187
TRAVIS: Preying Mantis man. Cat Girl.

00:08:34.187 --> 00:08:39.464
TALIESIN: Camp Crystal Lake, oh that makes me
happy.

00:08:39.464 --> 00:08:41.970
SAM: These chopsticks are amazing.

00:08:41.970 --> 00:08:48.798
LAURA: The chopsticks are awesome, but don't try
to pick up metal dice with them because they're

00:08:48.798 --> 00:08:50.020
way too heavy.

00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:52.145
LIAM and LAURA: Don't eat metal dice.

00:08:52.145 --> 00:08:56.170
TRAVIS: Ooh, the Walking Dead t-shirt. I call dibs
on this next week!

00:08:56.170 --> 00:09:01.949
MATT: There you go. Thank you very much, Loot
Crate, for sponsoring us. You can go to

00:09:01.949 --> 00:09:03.794
lootcrate.com/criticalrole.

00:09:03.794 --> 00:09:07.852
TRAVIS: Promo code "criticalrole."

00:09:07.852 --> 00:09:09.337
LIAM: Beginner's luck.

00:09:09.337 --> 00:09:10.294
LAURA: That's right.

00:09:10.294 --> 00:09:11.077
TRAVIS: Good job.

00:09:11.077 --> 00:09:12.717
TALIESIN: That one's going to fail you every time,
now.

00:09:12.717 --> 00:09:19.904
MATT: That would have been impressive. Next up,
let's see. GM Tips. We now have the second episode

00:09:19.904 --> 00:09:23.905
that just went up on YouTube. They go up a couple
of days early on Alpha if you want to check that

00:09:23.905 --> 00:09:30.377
out. The most recent episode deals with
improvisation, dealing with the unexpected. I'm a

00:09:30.377 --> 00:09:33.946
big fan of this new run. We get to go a little
more in-depth with the elements of running your

00:09:33.946 --> 00:09:37.286
own games at home. So, if you're a GM, check them
out. They come out every week, we have new ones

00:09:37.286 --> 00:09:41.543
coming out for the next six or so weeks. I can't
remember how many episodes we did. So, for a

00:09:41.543 --> 00:09:46.940
while, so every week, a new one coming. Alpha on
Tuesdays or Wednesdays, and then on Thursdays on

00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:54.692
YouTube, so check that out. Next up here we have
Titanfall 2 came out!

00:09:54.692 --> 00:09:56.519
TRAVIS: Titanfall 2!

00:09:56.519 --> 00:10:03.151
MATT: It's fun. I play Jack Cooper, your
protagonist in the single-player campaign. It's

00:10:03.151 --> 00:10:05.584
basically a future buddy cop film with a giant
robot.

00:10:05.584 --> 00:10:07.806
TRAVIS: You sound sexy in that, man. Just
saying.

00:10:07.806 --> 00:10:09.255
MATT: Thank you.

00:10:09.255 --> 00:10:10.086
LAURA: You do!

00:10:10.086 --> 00:10:11.175
TRAVIS: High noon!

00:10:11.175 --> 00:10:13.655
MATT: (as Victor) It's how I like it! I'm like
this the entire game!

00:10:13.655 --> 00:10:15.689
TRAVIS: That's a whole different Titanfall.

00:10:15.689 --> 00:10:20.804
LIAM: I'm in there too! I've returned from the
first game as Barker and I will yell at you if

00:10:20.804 --> 00:10:26.180
you're in my faction. Damn, that's got some weight
to it, son! Mmm!

00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:27.997
MARISHA: At least a d8.

00:10:27.997 --> 00:10:29.385
LIAM: (explosion noise)

00:10:29.385 --> 00:10:31.383
MATT: And that was the end of Tyriok.

00:10:31.383 --> 00:10:32.904
LIAM: (as Tyriok) I shot something else off!

00:10:32.904 --> 00:10:34.510
MATT: (laughs) Oh god.

00:10:34.510 --> 00:10:41.884
TRAVIS: Oh yeah! Telltale's Batman episode three
came out. I really like the way that's going. Fun.

00:10:41.884 --> 00:10:44.554
LAURA: There's some good stuff happening in that
episode.

00:10:44.554 --> 00:10:46.222
LIAM: Who is this Batman character?

00:10:46.222 --> 00:10:53.085
MATT: Next up, our Critical Role Halloween costume
contest finishes next week. Halloween night is the

00:10:53.085 --> 00:10:56.211
last time to submit so if you have a Halloween
costume if you haven't finished yet, get it

00:10:56.211 --> 00:11:00.532
finished, put up some photos with the hashtag
#criticalcostumes on Twitter. We will be judging

00:11:00.532 --> 00:11:04.064
those in the coming week and giving you guys
prizes and rewards and all the silliness that we

00:11:04.064 --> 00:11:07.792
can try and produce for you because we're excited.
So many good things are already out there. You guys

00:11:07.792 --> 00:11:09.431
have been crazy!

00:11:09.431 --> 00:11:11.068
LAURA: Yeah. There's been some really
phenomenal--

00:11:11.068 --> 00:11:13.348
SAM: Can I enter the contest as this?

00:11:13.348 --> 00:11:16.804
MATT: I believe you already have, and you can win all of
your shirts back.

00:11:16.804 --> 00:11:19.406
SAM: Oh shit! Then I do not want to
do that.

00:11:19.453 --> 00:11:21.738
(laughter)

00:11:21.738 --> 00:11:26.402
MATT: Fantastic. Marisha. There is a new Signal
Boost episode.

00:11:26.402 --> 00:11:31.620
MARISHA: Oh yeah! Both the Signal Boost Halloween
episodes are out. And Taliesin and I are in them.

00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:34.879
And you make a cameo in the latest episode.

00:11:34.879 --> 00:11:38.940
MATT: I stare at a mirror. It's fun.

00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:43.231
MARISHA: Yeah. Go watch for Halloween.

00:11:43.231 --> 00:11:47.875
MATT: Travis. How about Talks Machina?

00:11:47.875 --> 00:11:53.158
TRAVIS: Yes! We are super excited about this one.
Starting November 15th and every Tuesday after on

00:11:53.158 --> 00:11:58.207
Alpha we will finally get to introduce Talks
Machina which is our Critical Role talk show.

00:11:58.207 --> 00:12:04.272
Hosted by our amazing friend Brian Wayne Foster.
You can follow him at Brian Wayne Foster something

00:12:04.272 --> 00:12:05.133
something.

00:12:05.133 --> 00:12:06.524
MARISHA: It's like @brianwfoster.

00:12:06.524 --> 00:12:12.868
TRAVIS: @brianwfoster. And you can also catch the
Talks Machina page on Twitter @talksmachina. You

00:12:12.868 --> 00:12:17.459
can also get early access if you go to
alphainvite.com for early access to the page.

00:12:17.459 --> 00:12:21.893
We're going to be on there; it's our chance to
give insight after the game. It'll be a weekly

00:12:21.893 --> 00:12:26.593
thing so we can answer questions that people might
have, talk about moments that happened, how it

00:12:26.593 --> 00:12:30.633
went well, how it didn't, how we suck. There will
always be a few of us on there every week, we

00:12:30.633 --> 00:12:34.301
might even have some guests, and some segments!
It's going to be awesome. It's something we've

00:12:34.301 --> 00:12:35.504
been wanting to do for a while--

00:12:35.504 --> 00:12:38.389
LAURA: Yeah. And Brian's a really awesome guy so
we're excited about it.

00:12:38.389 --> 00:12:40.978
MARISHA: Yeah. You guys are going to love him. He
is great.

00:12:40.978 --> 00:12:42.241
MATT: Brian is awesome.

00:12:42.241 --> 00:12:43.392
TRAVIS: Yeah. Hai!

00:12:43.392 --> 00:12:54.886
MATT: Hai! That's all the major business
announcements. The final announcement, for those

00:12:54.886 --> 00:13:01.580
who weren't paying attention to social media.
Yeah. Take your glove off.

00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:03.908
MARISHA: Oh!

00:13:03.908 --> 00:13:05.536
TRAVIS: Take it off! Take that glove off!

00:13:05.536 --> 00:13:07.461
TALIESIN: We're doing that.

00:13:07.461 --> 00:13:08.952
SAM: That's no fake hand!

00:13:08.952 --> 00:13:10.686
TRAVIS: That ring better be there!

00:13:10.686 --> 00:13:12.265
MARISHA: He put a ring on it!

00:13:12.265 --> 00:13:15.129
(cheering)

00:13:15.129 --> 00:13:17.676
LIAM: Applause, applause, applause!

00:13:17.676 --> 00:13:21.961
MARISHA: I have &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; to look forward to in my
later years.

00:13:21.961 --> 00:13:24.006
MATT: (as Victor) So excited!

00:13:24.006 --> 00:13:26.548
LAURA: Congratulations!

00:13:26.548 --> 00:13:29.123
LIAM: I mean, he doesn't have to take it off!

00:13:29.123 --> 00:13:32.822
MATT: (as Victor) Only parts of it.

00:13:32.822 --> 00:13:36.706
SAM: Are we going to do a Critical Role themed
wedding?

00:13:36.706 --> 00:13:38.026
TRAVIS: Oh my god.

00:13:38.026 --> 00:13:40.375
MARISHA: No. No.

00:13:40.375 --> 00:13:44.522
MATT: That's not going to be a thing. But we have
already decided on our date.

00:13:44.522 --> 00:13:51.374
MARISHA: Although I might still have Travis
Willingham as my flower girl. Doing the dust of

00:13:51.374 --> 00:13:52.825
tracelessness.

00:13:52.825 --> 00:13:54.441
TRAVIS: I would be honored.

00:13:54.441 --> 00:13:56.114
TALIESIN: So cute!

00:13:56.114 --> 00:14:03.435
SAM: I'll start writing my Best Man speech. It'll
be a song.

00:14:03.435 --> 00:14:05.705
MATT: All the limericks in one.

00:14:05.705 --> 00:14:07.270
LIAM: Delivered in tiger?

00:14:07.270 --> 00:14:09.546
SAM: Yes. Delivered in tiger makeup.

00:14:09.546 --> 00:14:17.094
MATT: You've now done a tiger outfit twice. Two
different tigers. All right. On that note, let's

00:14:17.094 --> 00:14:21.428
go ahead and dive in to tonight's episode of
Halloween Critical Role.

00:14:21.428 --> 00:15:51.907
[dramatic music]

00:15:51.907 --> 00:16:06.706
MATT: Welcome back. As we last left off, our band
of adventurers, Vox Machina, were in the process

00:16:06.706 --> 00:16:12.739
of formulating their plan of attack against the
Chroma Conclave, a group of chromatic dragons that

00:16:12.739 --> 00:16:21.556
had banded together under their king, a
massive-sized red dragon that sundered the

00:16:21.556 --> 00:16:27.691
Tal'Dorei countryside and currently sits on the
main city of Emon. You have traversed multiple

00:16:27.691 --> 00:16:32.747
planes of the world and have gathered these
various artifacts called the Vestiges of

00:16:32.747 --> 00:16:38.736
Divergence in preparation for this battle, honing
your skills. You guys, after finally defeating

00:16:38.736 --> 00:16:44.135
your third member of the Conclave and allying with
a fourth, Raishan, you defeated Vorugal, the white

00:16:44.135 --> 00:16:50.619
dragon, over in the ruins of Draconia in
Wildemount. You are now returning, after gathering

00:16:50.619 --> 00:16:55.501
the spoils of the fight, making your way to the
next leg of your journey, to the very, very fast

00:16:55.501 --> 00:17:01.210
approaching conflict with the Cinder King himself.
And that's where we begin. Last we left off in the

00:17:01.210 --> 00:17:07.605
middle of a nearby frozen forest, Percival and
Vex, probably a fair distance of time apart make

00:17:07.605 --> 00:17:08.776
your-- no.

00:17:08.776 --> 00:17:11.706
(laughter)

00:17:11.706 --> 00:17:13.468
LIAM: That's "later."

00:17:13.468 --> 00:17:17.513
MATT: Jumped the gun.

00:17:17.513 --> 00:17:21.600
LIAM: Matt, I don't know how we're going to do
this. I got to look right at you.

00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:25.656
LAURA: Look directly below. Maybe stare at his
eyes.

00:17:25.656 --> 00:17:27.753
LIAM: I'm going to look at the torch over his
right shoulder.

00:17:27.753 --> 00:17:32.027
(laughter)

00:17:32.027 --> 00:17:34.392
TRAVIS: He's missing so many teeth!

00:17:34.392 --> 00:17:40.457
LIAM: We got to go shopping or drinking or
something, nothing serious for the love of

00:17:40.457 --> 00:17:42.188
Sarenrae.

00:17:42.188 --> 00:17:50.395
MATT: So! As you guys reconvene towards Scanlan's
Magnificent Mansion to prepare for the next leg of

00:17:50.395 --> 00:17:52.179
your journey, what do you wish to do?

00:17:52.179 --> 00:17:55.102
SAM: Wait, we're in the Mansion right now?

00:17:55.155 --> 00:17:58.515
LAURA: No, we're at the top of the ravine.

00:17:58.515 --> 00:18:01.275
TALISAN: We're preparing to go through a portal.

00:18:01.275 --> 00:18:03.452
MATT: Correct, you guys are. So you've gathered to
go ahead and make--

00:18:03.452 --> 00:18:06.064
LAURA: Did you want to sleep before we went back
to Whitestone?

00:18:06.064 --> 00:18:13.511
MARISHA: No, I can go. Yeah, no. It's been eight
hours, I've done my thing?

00:18:13.511 --> 00:18:21.508
MATT: Yes, for the restoring some of the farmland,
yeah. Which as you complete the entirety of the

00:18:21.508 --> 00:18:27.032
spell, you watch as the rest of the snow melt
begins to turn to water, and you watch as the land

00:18:27.032 --> 00:18:29.855
itself grows more fertile and the crops begin to
pop forth. Like you began to see when the ritual

00:18:29.855 --> 00:18:35.974
initiated itself. With the completion of the land
cleansed, you are free to go to the next length of

00:18:35.974 --> 00:18:37.229
your journey.

00:18:37.229 --> 00:18:40.411
MARISHA: Sorry.

00:18:40.411 --> 00:18:44.564
TALIESIN: Stop, I can't make eye contact. I'm
sorry, it's okay. We'll get there.

00:18:44.564 --> 00:18:46.262
LAURA: I think you look great, Matt.

00:18:46.262 --> 00:18:48.639
LIAM: You look like Doc Brown exploded, I don't
know what to do.

00:18:48.639 --> 00:18:52.704
TALIESIN: Pat that tuft of hair down.

00:18:52.704 --> 00:18:59.732
MATT: Marty! Okay. Happy Halloween.

00:18:59.732 --> 00:19:01.973
LIAM: 30 more minutes, 30 more minutes and we'll
settle down.

00:19:01.973 --> 00:19:05.353
MARISHA: You have to get immune to it.

00:19:05.353 --> 00:19:11.250
LIAM: I would like to set the Deathwalker's Ward
to Matthew's costume.

00:19:11.250 --> 00:19:14.209
MATT: All right, you take a short rest to set
your-- (laughs).

00:19:14.209 --> 00:19:18.776
LIAM: That's from Vasselheim.

00:19:18.776 --> 00:19:23.497
MATT: What else do you guys wish to do? What's the
next step in your journey?

00:19:23.497 --> 00:19:27.884
SAM: I mean we got to go back to Whitestone, right
away? Is there anything else to do here? Is there

00:19:27.884 --> 00:19:33.871
anything to deliver, any piece of any body to take
with us? Anything? We got everything already?

00:19:33.871 --> 00:19:38.761
LAURA: We need to deliver Ripley's arm back in
Ank'Harel.

00:19:38.761 --> 00:19:39.961
SAM: Okay.

00:19:39.961 --> 00:19:41.112
LAURA: That needs to happen.

00:19:41.112 --> 00:19:42.285
SAM: Sure.

00:19:42.285 --> 00:19:44.238
LAURA: Kashaw's in Vasselheim.

00:19:44.238 --> 00:19:45.261
SAM: Sure.

00:19:45.261 --> 00:19:46.400
LAURA: We need to do something about him.

00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:47.682
MARISHA: He might be in Whitestone by now.

00:19:47.682 --> 00:19:49.730
LAURA: He might be back. He might be on his way
here.

00:19:49.730 --> 00:19:54.567
TRAVIS: He's a dick, he can take care of himself.

00:19:54.567 --> 00:19:59.354
LAURA: Hopefully, he won't just loose something 
on the Ravenites here.

00:19:59.402 --> 00:20:03.556
SAM: Let's get out of here.

00:20:03.556 --> 00:20:06.097
MARISHA: They've been through so much.

00:20:06.097 --> 00:20:11.782
LIAM: I mean it's really reconfirming his whole
life-view so, you know. Hi!

00:20:11.782 --> 00:20:13.147
LAURA: Hi!

00:20:13.147 --> 00:20:14.773
TRAVIS: I'm having trouble.

00:20:14.773 --> 00:20:19.175
SAM: All right. Keyleth! Cast your thing and let's
get the fuck out of here.

00:20:19.175 --> 00:20:22.118
LAURA: Let's get on to Whitestone. Get on getting
on.

00:20:22.118 --> 00:20:25.491
MARISHA: I'm coming, boo.

00:20:25.491 --> 00:20:30.500
MATT: As you focus and touch the outside of the
tree, you watch as this small, familiar portal

00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:35.577
begins to tear its way through the outer bark of
the nearby trunk. From there, as you reach through

00:20:35.577 --> 00:20:38.798
the magic creating this portal between you and
Whitestone, you hear the voice echo in the

00:20:38.798 --> 00:20:46.673
distance, "I hear you." And thus, the temporary
doorway between here and Whitestone is open. The

00:20:46.673 --> 00:20:53.550
rest of you guys rush through, with Kima and Pike
in tow, you make your way into Whitestone itself.

00:20:53.550 --> 00:21:02.715
At this point in time, it looks like it's fairly
late in the afternoon. It's still day here, that's

00:21:02.715 --> 00:21:10.203
a day, eight hours there. Actually no, it would be
pretty early morning by here. At this point, you

00:21:10.203 --> 00:21:16.913
step out and the sky is starting to come to light.
You see the blue slowly transitioning into a light

00:21:16.913 --> 00:21:20.637
orange to a yellow as the sunrise is making its
way over the mountain range that surrounds the

00:21:20.637 --> 00:21:26.651
outside of Whitestone. You're met with a few
wandering guards that wander through the town that

00:21:26.651 --> 00:21:31.185
acknowledge your presence, but it is your call as
to what you wish to do now.

00:21:31.185 --> 00:21:42.177
SAM: Does the town look like it's safe and
intact?

00:21:42.177 --> 00:21:45.580
MATT: It seems like it hasn't suffered any sort of
incursion or attack, yeah.

00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:46.782
SAM: Okay, yeah. That's good.

00:21:46.782 --> 00:21:48.595
MARISHA: We've only been gone for what? 24 hours?

00:21:48.595 --> 00:21:50.405
LAURA: No, like two days because we slept there.

00:21:50.405 --> 00:21:51.816
TALIESIN: About two days.

00:21:51.816 --> 00:21:54.322
MARISHA: I'm going to go check and see if I can
find Kash.

00:21:54.322 --> 00:22:01.375
TALIESIN: Also going to head towards the castle.
And we should drop off some of our spoils.

00:22:01.375 --> 00:22:02.788
LAURA: Our loot.

00:22:02.788 --> 00:22:04.634
TRAVIS: Where? Where do we drop them off at?

00:22:04.634 --> 00:22:06.374
LAURA: The castle?

00:22:06.374 --> 00:22:09.384
TALIESIN: I would imagine the treasury room is
where it can be.

00:22:09.384 --> 00:22:12.419
MATT: There is a treasury vault in the Whitestone
castle.

00:22:12.419 --> 00:22:16.419
TRAVIS: Oh. Cool. Yeah. Totally knew about that
place.

00:22:16.419 --> 00:22:23.521
MATT: All right, Pike says she's going to go and
check in with the temple and make sure everything

00:22:23.521 --> 00:22:29.508
there is taken care of and situated. Kima leaves
with you guys towards the Whitestone castle. As

00:22:29.508 --> 00:22:32.980
you make your way up, you get to the very outside
of the castle at the time the sunrise finally

00:22:32.980 --> 00:22:37.286
breaks the mountain range and you see the sun
coming in. What little bit of mist begins to

00:22:37.286 --> 00:22:43.157
slowly burn off of the surrounding forested area.
The cold, brisk morning air is immediately met

00:22:43.157 --> 00:22:48.147
with that warm ray of sun hitting you and it's
welcoming both to be returning to a place of

00:22:48.147 --> 00:22:53.288
comfort but also the transition into day itself is
a very warm and welcoming experience. As you step

00:22:53.288 --> 00:22:58.245
towards the front, there are four guards at the
front gate. They step aside to let you in. As you

00:22:58.245 --> 00:23:06.504
step into the main foyer of the area, you already
see a familiar sight. You see there waiting, arms

00:23:06.504 --> 00:23:09.840
crossed, leaning against the wall, Seeker Asum.

00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:13.839
LAURA: Scars still on the face?

00:23:13.839 --> 00:23:22.282
MATT: Yeah, still acid-pocked scar across the
right side, ruining the tattooed face. The rest of

00:23:22.282 --> 00:23:25.851
the castle seems relatively quiet at this time, as
it is very early.

00:23:25.851 --> 00:23:28.749
MARISHA: She's the only one-- &lt;i&gt;he's&lt;/i&gt; the only one
there?

00:23:28.749 --> 00:23:35.478
MATT: Within the actual foyer of the castle, yes,
the main entrance area. As you guys begin to step

00:23:35.478 --> 00:23:48.429
inside, Seeker Asum steps in your direction. Steps
in your direction, and Kima is already taking a

00:23:48.429 --> 00:23:54.385
brisk walk in that direction and goes, pointing
outward toward Seeker Asum. "Now--"

00:23:54.385 --> 00:24:04.151
MARISHA: I grab Kima by the wrist. Not right now,
maybe?

00:24:04.151 --> 00:24:10.599
MATT: "Now you told me you'd already met with a
creature. This is the--" At which point, Seeker

00:24:10.599 --> 00:24:16.964
Asum's hands rest on to Kima's shoulder. Kima's
head whips around to face Asum, and Asum says,

00:24:16.964 --> 00:24:20.467
"You need not worry."

00:24:20.467 --> 00:24:24.411
SAM: He's going to try a thing on her.

00:24:24.411 --> 00:24:26.744
LAURA: She &lt;i&gt;hates&lt;/i&gt; that!

00:24:26.744 --> 00:24:28.580
SAM: She doesn't like it.

00:24:28.580 --> 00:24:30.844
MARISHA: Oh no.

00:24:30.844 --> 00:24:32.371
TALIESIN: He's going to the sheets.

00:24:32.371 --> 00:24:35.781
MATT: Kima's eyes blink for a moment and she--

00:24:35.781 --> 00:24:40.323
MARISHA: No no no no no no. I still have my hands
on Kima, right?

00:24:40.323 --> 00:24:41.125
MATT: Yeah.

00:24:41.125 --> 00:24:45.749
MARISHA: I counter with a 6th-level Dispel Magic.
Can I do that?

00:24:45.749 --> 00:24:47.414
MATT: You can certainly try.

00:24:47.414 --> 00:24:48.801
MARISHA: Fuck.

00:24:48.801 --> 00:24:50.807
MATT: All right, so as you begin to--

00:24:50.807 --> 00:24:54.165
LAURA: Oh no, we're going to start a fight, that's
going to start a fight.

00:24:54.165 --> 00:24:59.050
MARISHA: I don't want her to fucking cast any shit
on Kima.

00:24:59.050 --> 00:25:01.876
TRAVIS: What if it was just a chill out spell?

00:25:01.876 --> 00:25:08.033
MARISHA: It's probably a charm spell. Or a memory
spell. No, I don't want to fucking wait--

00:25:08.033 --> 00:25:11.885
MATT: It's not a Counterspell, but you can try to
cast it on her to see if it has any effect.

00:25:11.885 --> 00:25:13.801
MARISHA: Okay.

00:25:13.801 --> 00:25:20.872
MATT: All righty, so the DC of the spell-- okay.
So, as you pull back and begin chanting to

00:25:20.872 --> 00:25:25.621
yourself, clutching Kima and pulling her away from
Asum, Asum's grip leaves Kima's shoulder and Kima's

00:25:25.621 --> 00:25:30.312
still shaking her head groggily. You finish the
Dispel Magic and you feel the strange, warm pulse

00:25:30.312 --> 00:25:39.263
of energy radiate briefly out from Kima's body.
Kima turns to look at you and goes, "What-- why

00:25:39.263 --> 00:25:49.504
"would-- I'm sorry, I went groggy there for a
second. We've had a long day. Good to see you,

00:25:49.504 --> 00:26:02.147
"Asum." And Asum nods and says, "Well, the pleasure
is mine. Glad to see you all made it back safe and sound."

00:26:02.147 --> 00:26:07.629
SAM: Yes we did. Thank you, Asum.

00:26:07.629 --> 00:26:16.400
MATT: "We have a meeting set here in the next two
hours to gather our information and best situate

00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:27.462
"the next plan of action. You also have a friend
waiting for you. Your armored Kashaw returned but

00:26:27.462 --> 00:26:33.045
"a half day ago apparently. Sleeping at the moment
should you be interested in waking him from his

00:26:33.045 --> 00:26:39.262
"slumber and notifying him of his, well, his
services no longer being needed."

00:26:39.262 --> 00:26:41.368
TRAVIS: Did he return alone?

00:26:41.368 --> 00:26:44.746
MATT: "He did. And rather proud with his
findings."

00:26:44.746 --> 00:26:50.676
LAURA: Oh shit. Where are you off to now?

00:26:50.676 --> 00:26:52.863
MATT: "Oh, I'm here waiting for the meeting."

00:26:52.863 --> 00:26:54.236
LAURA: Lovely.

00:26:54.236 --> 00:26:56.484
MARISHA: And who all is going to be a part of this
meeting?

00:26:56.484 --> 00:27:00.706
MATT: "As far as I know, it's going to be myself,
Cassandra, Allura, and Drake."

00:27:00.706 --> 00:27:06.310
LAURA: Oh, good! Allura, we haven't seen her in
forever. Have we?

00:27:06.310 --> 00:27:08.076
SAM: We saw her pretty recently.

00:27:08.076 --> 00:27:13.113
LAURA: We did. Shit. Yes, we did. Never mind.

00:27:13.113 --> 00:27:15.692
SAM: All right. Well then, until the meeting?

00:27:15.692 --> 00:27:24.526
MATT: "Until the meeting. Now, food should be
ready." And Asum steps out into the sunshine and

00:27:24.526 --> 00:27:30.512
closes his eyes, takes a deep breath as the sun
rays hit and looks over his shoulder, smiles, and

00:27:30.512 --> 00:27:33.505
continues to walk down the path in towards
Whitestone itself.

00:27:33.505 --> 00:27:35.262
SAM: We can kill him right here, right now!

00:27:35.262 --> 00:27:36.400
MARISHA: (groans)

00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:38.123
TRAVIS: No, no. (coughs)

00:27:38.123 --> 00:27:45.109
MATT: Kima takes a couple steps and says, "Wow,
I'm more tired than I expected after that fight.

00:27:45.109 --> 00:27:48.333
"Then again, we did kill a dragon! And that is
&lt;i&gt;fantastic&lt;/i&gt;!"

00:27:48.333 --> 00:27:51.716
TRAVIS: We did. Yeah. And you got a brilliant new
sword.

00:27:51.716 --> 00:27:56.691
MATT: Which she pulls out and (swish). You can see
the arc of light streak across the blade as she

00:27:56.691 --> 00:28:02.340
flings it in the air with incredible strength for
a halfling of her size. She's still marveled by

00:28:02.340 --> 00:28:08.555
it. "You know what? I'm not going to sleep. I'm
going to go practice!" And she goes and runs off

00:28:08.555 --> 00:28:11.978
down one of the hallways towards one of the castle's
training rooms.

00:28:11.978 --> 00:28:20.000
TRAVIS: Wait, Kima, Kima! You don't hear anything
when you use that, do you? Like voices or someone

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:22.126
talking to you or--

00:28:22.126 --> 00:28:26.586
MATT: She holds the blade up to her ear. "No."

00:28:26.586 --> 00:28:32.280
TRAVIS: No, good! Good. It's a beginner problem,
but you're quite advanced. Not worried about it.

00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:33.675
Enjoy!

00:28:33.675 --> 00:28:39.405
MATT: "Thanks, Grog!" Slaps you on the shoulder
with an awkward glance and continues the

00:28:39.405 --> 00:28:43.210
excited steps forward into vanishing somewhere
into the castle.

00:28:43.210 --> 00:28:44.662
TRAVIS: The sword is clean.

00:28:44.662 --> 00:28:46.914
LAURA: Good job.

00:28:46.914 --> 00:28:49.623
TRAVIS: Yeah. Dodged a bullet on that one!

00:28:49.623 --> 00:28:52.235
LAURA: We should put that hide in the Treasury.

00:28:52.235 --> 00:28:53.666
TRAVIS: Hide?

00:28:53.666 --> 00:28:57.396
LAURA: The 140 pounds of dragonhide you're
carrying right now?

00:28:57.396 --> 00:28:59.811
TRAVIS: Oh right! I'm dragging it behind me.

00:28:59.811 --> 00:29:00.891
LAURA: Yeah.

00:29:00.891 --> 00:29:02.295
TRAVIS: Yeah. Right.

00:29:02.295 --> 00:29:06.344
TALIESIN: Like a body in a carpet.

00:29:06.344 --> 00:29:09.765
TRAVIS: Well, I'm off to deposit this hide!

00:29:09.765 --> 00:29:11.330
SAM: Good object work!

00:29:11.330 --> 00:29:18.448
TRAVIS: Yeah. Boy, I'm going to need to switch
shoulders! Getting a little roll in the ol' righty there.

00:29:18.448 --> 00:29:27.344
MARISHA: Keyleth grabs Vax as they wander off and
pulls him behind the rest of the crowd.

00:29:27.344 --> 00:29:31.469
MATT: Okay.

00:29:31.469 --> 00:29:33.097
MARISHA: Let's go.

00:29:33.097 --> 00:29:34.253
LIAM: Where?

00:29:34.253 --> 00:29:35.936
MARISHA: Let's track Raishan.

00:29:35.936 --> 00:29:37.428
LIAM: All right.

00:29:37.428 --> 00:29:46.131
MARISHA: Let's track her. Let's just do it right
now. Let's kill her. We can do it, she won't be

00:29:46.131 --> 00:29:49.556
expecting it. We can find her.

00:29:49.556 --> 00:29:55.004
LIAM: I pull her further away. She won't expect
it, but she is a fucking ancient being.

00:29:55.004 --> 00:30:01.696
MARISHA: But she's sick and she-- We can do it
right now. When she's not armed.

00:30:01.696 --> 00:30:04.704
LIAM: Keyleth, I want to kill a dragon as much as
you do.

00:30:04.704 --> 00:30:07.279
MARISHA: It's not about killing a dragon, it's
about killing &lt;i&gt;her&lt;/i&gt;.

00:30:07.279 --> 00:30:14.188
LIAM: I know, but we want it to work. We want her
to die. And if you and I do it, it's not going to

00:30:14.188 --> 00:30:22.069
happen. Her being sick is still up here. We need
the others. I really want to use both my arms to

00:30:22.069 --> 00:30:29.933
take her, but I can't. I take her by the arms. And
we need the others. If I thought we could do it--

00:30:29.933 --> 00:30:40.052
Listen to me. I love you, and if you ask me again,
I will go with you. But I don't think it will

00:30:40.052 --> 00:30:45.745
work. I think you and I will die. I think Raishan
will spit on our bodies. You will not get what you

00:30:45.745 --> 00:30:53.194
want. And then Thordak won't die. No one will be
happy. I understand--

00:30:53.194 --> 00:30:55.212
MARISHA: I just want this to be over.

00:30:55.212 --> 00:30:59.478
LIAM: I want this to be over.

00:30:59.478 --> 00:31:03.204
MARISHA: Okay.

00:31:03.204 --> 00:31:05.525
LIAM: We need to stay with the others; there's--

00:31:05.525 --> 00:31:09.279
MARISHA: Okay. Okay. I understand.

00:31:09.279 --> 00:31:20.868
LIAM: Listen to me; if you tell me to go in, I
will go in. But there's strength with the others.

00:31:20.868 --> 00:31:29.267
After this, if you tell me to go in, you say the
word. It's not like I haven't tried to throw my

00:31:29.267 --> 00:31:32.496
life away already. You think I wouldn't do it for
you?

00:31:32.496 --> 00:31:39.761
MARISHA: I feel like it's very telling when Grog
has more patience than I. (sighs) Okay.

00:31:39.761 --> 00:31:44.193
LIAM: Hey. It'll happen.

00:31:44.193 --> 00:31:53.164
MARISHA: I just don't want to wait so long that she
gets the upper hand on us. The longer we wait, the

00:31:53.164 --> 00:31:58.089
more she learns about us. The more we're letting
her in, the more we're revealing. I feel like the

00:31:58.089 --> 00:32:02.289
longer we wait, the closer is her inevitable
betrayal.

00:32:02.289 --> 00:32:14.562
LIAM: Pulls her in and touch foreheads. I don't
think we're going to be waiting for long; I

00:32:14.562 --> 00:32:16.242
really don't.

00:32:16.242 --> 00:32:20.196
MARISHA: Okay. Let's catch up with the others.

00:32:20.196 --> 00:32:24.026
LIAM: Yeah. Yeah.

00:32:24.026 --> 00:32:27.662
MATT: The rest of you, what have you been up to?

00:32:27.662 --> 00:32:31.001
SAM: I pull Percy aside and say, we can kill her
right now.

00:32:31.001 --> 00:32:34.769
LIAM: Ugh! It's a tiger!

00:32:34.769 --> 00:32:38.572
TALIESIN: Well?

00:32:38.572 --> 00:32:40.765
SAM: Well, we got to go to the treasury.

00:32:40.765 --> 00:32:42.157
TALIESIN: We have to go to the treasury.

00:32:42.157 --> 00:32:47.755
SAM: And then what? Who do we need to check in
with? Everyone, right? Gilmore and Kash and--

00:32:47.755 --> 00:32:49.558
LAURA: We've got a couple hours.

00:32:49.558 --> 00:32:53.148
TALIESIN: We have a couple hours. We need to talk
to people. We need to find out where this

00:32:53.148 --> 00:32:57.100
meeting's being held, if it's being held
downstairs or if it's being held in the battle room.

00:32:57.100 --> 00:32:58.752
LAURA: It won't be if Asum has anything to say
about it.

00:32:58.752 --> 00:33:00.629
TALIESIN: Well, maybe he won't.

00:33:00.629 --> 00:33:07.453
SAM: And what is this meeting? I know that we have
to have a conversation with Asum.

00:33:07.453 --> 00:33:09.245
MARISHA: Yeah, but what is this about?

00:33:09.245 --> 00:33:16.619
TALIESIN: This meeting may be the beginning of
something very violent or this may be the start of

00:33:16.619 --> 00:33:22.613
something; I don't know. But be prepared perhaps
that this meeting may be on moment.

00:33:22.613 --> 00:33:24.928
TRAVIS: (singing) Be prepared.

00:33:24.928 --> 00:33:30.508
TALIESIN: Don't think about it. Don't plan. Don't
have any thoughts in your head.

00:33:30.508 --> 00:33:34.222
LAURA: Improvise. We're good at that.

00:33:34.222 --> 00:33:42.783
TALIESIN: You can't lie about anything. Do not lie
to her about anything. And one of the ways we can

00:33:42.783 --> 00:33:49.672
lie best is by truthfully saying we have no plans
against her right now because we have no plans

00:33:49.672 --> 00:33:59.736
against her right now. The more we talk, the more
she will be able to perceive our deceptions, if we

00:33:59.736 --> 00:34:11.763
have any. Be very careful. This is going to be
very dangerous. There's going to be a lot of

00:34:11.763 --> 00:34:13.539
improvisation.

00:34:13.539 --> 00:34:16.742
LAURA: I hate knowing that she's going to be able
to hear all of our plans.

00:34:16.742 --> 00:34:19.621
MARISHA: (sighs)

00:34:19.621 --> 00:34:23.822
TALIESIN: Honestly, we should have assumed that
they could hear all of our plans from the

00:34:23.822 --> 00:34:24.990
beginning.

00:34:24.990 --> 00:34:26.605
LAURA: Yes.

00:34:26.605 --> 00:34:33.891
TALIESIN: (sighs) My fault, really. Well, we are
very good at being spied on.

00:34:33.891 --> 00:34:37.059
SAM: Yes, well, we like to talk.

00:34:37.059 --> 00:34:43.597
TALIESIN: And even if we do, even if we were to
get rid of her, there's no sense in believing that

00:34:43.597 --> 00:34:46.420
they still don't know everything we're doing.

00:34:46.420 --> 00:34:54.234
SAM: All right. Then we'll see what &lt;i&gt;he&lt;/i&gt; proposes
and take it from there.

00:34:54.234 --> 00:34:58.088
TALIESIN: And let's hope that we're downstairs,
and if we're not downstairs, there's still

00:34:58.088 --> 00:34:59.551
options.

00:34:59.551 --> 00:35:00.801
LAURA: All right.

00:35:00.801 --> 00:35:03.742
MATT: Grog, you've finally caught up with the
group. You've managed to drop off your large

00:35:03.742 --> 00:35:05.681
amount of dragon hide in return.

00:35:05.681 --> 00:35:12.218
TRAVIS: Holy shit, that skin weighs a ton. Good
thing I'm strong as fuck. What'd I miss?

00:35:12.218 --> 00:35:18.257
SAM: Is there a cold place in the treasure room?
Wait, this hide is going to be cured, or smoked,

00:35:18.257 --> 00:35:20.604
or something, whatever you do. Stretched?

00:35:20.604 --> 00:35:23.847
LAURA: It's got scales all over it. I mean that
stays, right? It doesn't have to be kept cold?

00:35:23.847 --> 00:35:25.864
MATT: I mean, it probably should be.

00:35:25.864 --> 00:35:27.101
LAURA: Kept cold.

00:35:27.101 --> 00:35:31.757
MATT: It probably should be attended to in a short
amount of time, like in the next week or so,

00:35:31.757 --> 00:35:32.866
before it's really--

00:35:32.866 --> 00:35:36.898
LAURA: Would it be an armorer, or a blacksmith,
or-- who works with dragonhide?

00:35:36.898 --> 00:35:40.411
SAM: Taliesin, what's the old fashioned word for
the guy who does the hide stuff?

00:35:40.411 --> 00:35:41.523
LIAM: Tanner.

00:35:41.523 --> 00:35:43.078
SAM: A tanner! Thank you!

00:35:43.078 --> 00:35:45.091
LAURA: Is there a tanner in Whitestone?

00:35:45.091 --> 00:35:47.584
TALIESIN: One would assume we have a tanner in
Whitestone.

00:35:47.584 --> 00:35:48.954
MATT: There are a few tanners, yeah.

00:35:48.954 --> 00:35:51.745
TRAVIS: Is it super cold where I dropped off the
hide? Like is it below ground?

00:35:51.745 --> 00:35:53.655
MATT: It's below ground. Yeah, it's not--

00:35:53.655 --> 00:35:54.897
TRAVIS: A bit chilly?

00:35:54.897 --> 00:35:58.210
MATT: Comparatively. Whitestone in general is a
pretty chilly place, so yeah.

00:35:58.210 --> 00:36:03.319
SAM: But not like a fake-bake. We want a real
tanner, right?

00:36:03.319 --> 00:36:07.131
LIAM: Hey, while they're talking about all this,
can I stealth away?

00:36:07.131 --> 00:36:09.209
MATT: Yes, you can. Make a stealth check.

00:36:09.209 --> 00:36:14.616
LIAM: I'll use Luck. 28.

00:36:14.616 --> 00:36:15.855
MATT: What was that?

00:36:15.855 --> 00:36:16.939
LIAM: 28.

00:36:16.939 --> 00:36:20.387
MATT: 28. Okay, yeah. You vanish without anybody
else noticing your disappearance.

00:36:20.443 --> 00:36:23.096
LIAM: I would like to go as quickly as I can
towards Gilmore's house.

00:36:23.096 --> 00:36:24.721
MATT: Okay.

00:36:24.721 --> 00:36:26.575
LAURA: He's cheating on you, Keyleth.

00:36:26.575 --> 00:36:30.070
MARISHA: (laughs) Look, it's 2016.

00:36:30.070 --> 00:36:33.130
TRAVIS: Did we decide what we do about
Raish--?

00:36:33.167 --> 00:36:35.741
LAURA: (shushing)

00:36:35.741 --> 00:36:36.947
TALIESIN: Seeker Asum?

00:36:36.947 --> 00:36:37.909
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:36:37.909 --> 00:36:39.768
TALIESIN: We're going to talk, we're going to
listen, and we're going to be prepared for

00:36:39.768 --> 00:36:40.749
anything.

00:36:40.749 --> 00:36:42.331
TRAVIS: Okay, so we're not (death noises and
farts)?

00:36:42.331 --> 00:36:43.734
LAURA: Not just yet.

00:36:43.734 --> 00:36:46.940
TALIESIN: We're going to talk, we're going to
listen, and be prepared for anything.

00:36:46.940 --> 00:36:50.113
SAM: Was that last sound the sound of Seeker
Asum's bowels?

00:36:50.113 --> 00:36:51.998
TRAVIS: It's open to interpretation.

00:36:51.998 --> 00:36:57.550
SAM: Okay. After he dies, letting it all out?

00:36:57.550 --> 00:37:02.205
TRAVIS: Yeah. Just want to be fancy. I lean that
way but, you know. Cannot speak for other people.

00:37:02.205 --> 00:37:05.277
TALIESIN: The work speaks for itself, really.

00:37:05.277 --> 00:37:11.306
MATT: Fair enough. Vax, as you rush down towards
the homestead that Gilmore had made here in

00:37:11.306 --> 00:37:16.587
Whitestone, the door is closed. There's a large
pile out front of ruined furniture that's been

00:37:16.587 --> 00:37:22.634
jammed into this collection. Presumably from the
last encounter they had when the incursion of

00:37:22.634 --> 00:37:26.824
assassins made their way in. But the door's
closed, and seemingly locked.

00:37:26.824 --> 00:37:28.678
LIAM: (knocks)

00:37:28.678 --> 00:37:31.891
MATT: A few moments pass, no response.

00:37:31.891 --> 00:37:33.580
(Mario coin sound)

00:37:33.580 --> 00:37:35.807
LIAM: That's him, that's magic!

00:37:35.807 --> 00:37:37.767
MATT: But you find a cool coin.

00:37:37.767 --> 00:37:39.655
LIAM: (knocks)

00:37:39.655 --> 00:37:44.609
MATT: Yeah. Eventually you hear a little rustling,
and you hear a voice, muffled, from the upper

00:37:44.609 --> 00:37:47.789
floor say, "Confound it, I'll be right down!"

00:37:47.789 --> 00:37:50.843
LIAM: I'm so scared of this with that hair on your
head.

00:37:50.843 --> 00:37:52.342
LAURA: Yeah.

00:37:52.342 --> 00:37:56.569
MATT: You hear some footsteps, and then eventually
the door (unlocking sound). You hear the unlocking

00:37:56.569 --> 00:38:02.635
mechanism. The door swings open a little bit. And
you see, you know, morning robe, chest open, curly

00:38:02.635 --> 00:38:12.309
chest hair poking out. A very groggy bedhead.
Gilmore opens the door. "Yes, can I help-- Oh.

00:38:12.309 --> 00:38:13.847
"Good morning."

00:38:13.847 --> 00:38:16.563
(laughter)

00:38:16.563 --> 00:38:17.823
TRAVIS: I don't know what to do.

00:38:17.823 --> 00:38:19.526
LIAM: Why did I do this? Tonight?

00:38:19.526 --> 00:38:21.162
MARISHA: Now you know why.

00:38:21.162 --> 00:38:28.358
LIAM: Hey, this is not fair. Can I come in to
talk? Quickly, I have to head back to the others.

00:38:28.358 --> 00:38:30.681
MATT: "Of course. Would you like some tea?"

00:38:30.681 --> 00:38:34.417
LIAM: No. I don't even have time, I just want to
talk to you.

00:38:34.417 --> 00:38:37.048
MATT: "I'd like some tea. Come on in, come on
in."

00:38:37.048 --> 00:38:38.303
LIAM: All right.

00:38:38.303 --> 00:38:44.056
MATT: He ushers you to enter, and leads you to one
of the small chairs. And he walks back into the

00:38:44.056 --> 00:38:50.610
kitchen, shouting over his shoulder, "So!
Vax'ildan, please. Tell me what's on your mind."

00:38:50.610 --> 00:38:56.168
LIAM: You know, we're getting closer to the end
game here.

00:38:56.168 --> 00:39:01.484
MATT: (laughs) "I certainly hope so. It's taken a
couple years off my lifespan."

00:39:01.484 --> 00:39:04.605
LIAM: We just killed another one of the dragons.

00:39:04.605 --> 00:39:06.340
MATT: "Really?!"

00:39:06.340 --> 00:39:07.810
LIAM: Yeah.

00:39:07.810 --> 00:39:10.535
MATT: "How many is that for you now? Three?"

00:39:10.535 --> 00:39:12.412
LIAM: It is three.

00:39:12.412 --> 00:39:20.053
MATT: "Making a name for yourself. I'm proud of
you." A few moments pass, and silence. And Gilmore

00:39:20.053 --> 00:39:26.392
walks back out, clutching a small tray with a few
teacups. And as he's walking, he's twirling his

00:39:26.392 --> 00:39:31.212
finger and you can see a little spiral of flame
encircling the tea kettle as it begins to heat up.

00:39:31.212 --> 00:39:36.182
He brings it over, sets it down on the table.
Pulls his robe in and sits down across from you on

00:39:36.182 --> 00:39:46.390
this low slung tea table. Takes a bit and sips it.
"So, what brings you here this early in the

00:39:46.390 --> 00:39:48.334
"morning, friend?"

00:39:48.334 --> 00:40:11.374
LIAM: I think I might be dead in a couple of days.
So I came here to apologize. If you think I have

00:40:11.374 --> 00:40:18.867
no feelings for you, you're kidding yourself. I
care for you very deeply. I have for a long time.

00:40:18.867 --> 00:40:40.560
And I don't think I've treated you fairly. But I
wasn't playing games. Shaun. It's been a little

00:40:40.560 --> 00:40:47.495
weird lately, and I understand why, but I want you
to know that I love you as a dear, dear friend,

00:40:47.495 --> 00:40:53.578
and I really don't think I'm going to be here in a
few days. And I would hate to think that I would be--

00:40:53.578 --> 00:41:01.189
MATT: "Shh. That's far too fatalistic for the
Vax'ildan that I-- number one. Number two, you

00:41:01.189 --> 00:41:09.848
"have nothing to apologize for. Look, everything's
on fire around us all the time. We all jump at

00:41:09.848 --> 00:41:24.380
"whatever bit of comfort finds its way before us.
And at the same time, I appreciate your honesty.

00:41:24.380 --> 00:41:35.405
"And I'm thankful for the connection that we do
have. And yes, heartbreak comes. But heartbreak

00:41:35.405 --> 00:41:42.460
"goes. It's part of life. It just means that I need
to find somebody who's a little more my speed."

00:41:42.460 --> 00:41:45.154
LIAM: That guy'll be fast.

00:41:45.154 --> 00:41:55.588
MATT: "He better be. Don't worry about it. Go.
Kill a dragon. Another. Kill two more. Kill six

00:41:55.588 --> 00:42:02.065
"more, I don't care! Just know that you're coming
back, because I need you and your friends to keep

00:42:02.065 --> 00:42:04.528
"pimping out my name."

00:42:04.528 --> 00:42:13.598
LIAM: Sure. Whoever gets you will be a very lucky
man.

00:42:13.598 --> 00:42:19.210
MATT: "I know. I know."

00:42:19.210 --> 00:42:26.640
LIAM: Love you.

00:42:26.779 --> 00:42:30.053
MATT: "I know. You sure you don't want any tea?"

00:42:30.053 --> 00:42:36.010
LIAM: I'm really nauseous right now. I almost
didn't come here.

00:42:36.010 --> 00:42:46.823
MATT: "I'm glad you did." He takes your cup.
"Waste not, want not. (sips) Now go! Stop being

00:42:46.823 --> 00:42:48.546
"uncomfortable in front of me! I need to get my
morning--"

00:42:48.546 --> 00:42:49.476
LIAM: Yeah. Yes.

00:42:49.476 --> 00:42:51.676
MATT: "--situated."

00:42:51.676 --> 00:42:53.661
LIAM: Goodbye.

00:42:53.661 --> 00:43:03.571
MATT: He stands there. Waves his hand and the door
opens on its own.

00:43:03.571 --> 00:43:07.351
LIAM: I leave.

00:43:07.351 --> 00:43:10.285
MATT: He takes you by the shoulder real fast
before you leave, and turns around and goes,

00:43:10.285 --> 00:43:20.653
"'Till next time. Say it."

00:43:20.653 --> 00:43:24.050
LIAM: 'Till next time.

00:43:24.050 --> 00:43:33.235
MATT: "All right. Go." And you feel a little
pat on your backside, on the way out. He

00:43:33.289 --> 00:43:40.664
sits there holding his tea, watching you leave.
Door slams behind you. You make your way back.

00:43:40.664 --> 00:43:44.153
LIAM: I'm sorry I made you do that in that
skullcap, Matt.

00:43:44.153 --> 00:43:47.883
MATT: Look, I don't have to look at this. I'm
fine!

00:43:47.883 --> 00:43:50.112
(laughter)

00:43:50.112 --> 00:43:52.354
MATT: From my perspective, this is easy.

00:43:52.354 --> 00:43:54.392
LIAM: All I saw was a very handsome man.

00:43:54.392 --> 00:43:55.720
(laughter)

00:43:55.720 --> 00:43:58.238
TRAVIS: Training. This is all training. It's
training at a thousand times gravity.

00:43:58.238 --> 00:44:02.454
MATT: (laughs) It totally is! Like performing arts
with the weights on.

00:44:02.454 --> 00:44:04.995
LIAM: Been doing this since the 80s and 90s, man.

00:44:04.995 --> 00:44:11.218
LAURA: We need to find Kashaw. Before the meeting,
yes?

00:44:11.218 --> 00:44:14.040
MARISHA: Yeah, I set off. To find Kashaw with
Vex.

00:44:14.040 --> 00:44:18.938
MATT: All right. Asking around quickly, he is back
in the room where he's been staying in Whitestone.

00:44:18.938 --> 00:44:22.366
You go back to his door. It's closed.

00:44:22.366 --> 00:44:25.698
MARISHA: (knocks)

00:44:25.698 --> 00:44:26.935
LAURA: Kash?

00:44:26.935 --> 00:44:28.637
MATT: Nothing.

00:44:28.637 --> 00:44:30.557
LAURA: (loudly) Are you sleeping?

00:44:30.557 --> 00:44:32.394
MATT: Nothing.

00:44:32.394 --> 00:44:35.045
SAM: Break down the door.

00:44:35.045 --> 00:44:36.364
MARISHA: Kash?

00:44:36.364 --> 00:44:38.079
LAURA: I'm going to jiggle the lock. Is it
locked?

00:44:38.079 --> 00:44:39.282
MATT: It's not locked.

00:44:39.282 --> 00:44:40.986
LAURA: I open it. Just a crack, and look in.

00:44:40.986 --> 00:44:42.451
MARISHA: I hope you're not naked!

00:44:42.451 --> 00:44:43.659
LAURA: Shh.

00:44:43.659 --> 00:44:47.976
MATT: As you open it up, there's no light on the
inside, but the light does come in as you slowly

00:44:47.976 --> 00:44:54.417
open the door with a (squeaks). You can see he's
halfway out of his armor, passed out on his back,

00:44:54.417 --> 00:45:04.596
on the bed. He's one arm out, snoring loudly like
he was too tired to make it all the way, and (snores).

00:45:04.596 --> 00:45:06.331
LAURA: Should we let him sleep or should we talk
to him?

00:45:06.331 --> 00:45:08.005
MARISHA: I don't know.

00:45:08.005 --> 00:45:08.968
LAURA: He snores.

00:45:08.968 --> 00:45:09.858
MARISHA: Wow.

00:45:09.858 --> 00:45:12.993
LAURA: You know, my brother doesn't snore.

00:45:12.993 --> 00:45:14.306
MARISHA: No, I know.

00:45:14.306 --> 00:45:15.245
TRAVIS: Ew.

00:45:15.245 --> 00:45:16.121
MARISHA: No, I mean I don't--

00:45:16.121 --> 00:45:17.318
LAURA: No, just don't, just don't.

00:45:17.318 --> 00:45:18.522
MARISHA: Just don't worry about it.

00:45:18.522 --> 00:45:20.478
(laughter)

00:45:20.478 --> 00:45:22.342
TALIESIN: I love you, Travis.

00:45:22.342 --> 00:45:24.783
LIAM: You thought I'd be the one to fuck up.

00:45:24.783 --> 00:45:26.511
(laughter)

00:45:26.511 --> 00:45:30.131
LAURA: Do I have any like stones or any like rocks or
anything in my bag or--

00:45:30.131 --> 00:45:31.858
MARISHA: You're going to throw a rock at him?

00:45:31.858 --> 00:45:33.231
LAURA: Yeah, just to see if he wakes up.

00:45:33.231 --> 00:45:35.941
MARISHA: We can't just poke him? That seems so
weird, though.

00:45:35.941 --> 00:45:37.510
SAM: You're an archer.

00:45:37.510 --> 00:45:39.922
LAURA: Well, I don't want to kill him.

00:45:39.922 --> 00:45:43.684
MARISHA: Why don't we just tap on his shoulder?

00:45:43.684 --> 00:45:47.639
LAURA: I'll sneak in, tap his shoulder, come back
out, see if he wakes up.

00:45:47.639 --> 00:45:49.677
MARISHA: Oh, that's what I want to do.

00:45:49.677 --> 00:45:51.085
LAURA: I don't want him to know that, you know--

00:45:51.085 --> 00:45:54.679
MARISHA: That we did that? Sure. I'll stand on the
outside and look unsuspecting.

00:45:54.679 --> 00:45:58.091
LAURA: I want to sneak in and tickle his little
foot and walk out.

00:45:58.091 --> 00:46:00.404
MATT: Well, he still has his boots on.

00:46:00.404 --> 00:46:01.273
LAURA: Shit.

00:46:01.273 --> 00:46:03.293
MATT: It's more like his upper torso, he got
partway out of that.

00:46:03.293 --> 00:46:07.295
LAURA: All right, I tickle his hands.

00:46:07.295 --> 00:46:09.844
MATT: Okay so you're opening his palm--

00:46:09.844 --> 00:46:11.715
LAURA: Tickle his hands and then go back really
fast to the doorway.

00:46:11.715 --> 00:46:15.238
MATT: Okay, you tickle his hand. No response.

00:46:15.238 --> 00:46:16.303
LAURA: Fucking--

00:46:16.303 --> 00:46:18.022
MATT: (snores)

00:46:18.022 --> 00:46:19.773
LAURA: I flick his nose.

00:46:19.773 --> 00:46:24.521
MATT: As soon as you flick his nose and you start
to back away, there's a blur of motion as suddenly

00:46:24.521 --> 00:46:30.422
he comes leaping out of the bed (grunts) and goes
over and grabs his spear, his hand reaches for

00:46:30.422 --> 00:46:36.041
nothing in the air, and slings it forward in your
direction, (whoosh) bypassing by your face by a

00:46:36.041 --> 00:46:41.459
few inches. And he looks still half awake, going
(startled noises).

00:46:41.459 --> 00:46:47.219
MARISHA: Oh Kash, oh hi. Fancy meeting you here.
Shit.

00:46:47.219 --> 00:46:48.672
MATT: "Yeah, it's my room."

00:46:48.672 --> 00:46:49.626
MARISHA: I keep doing that.

00:46:49.626 --> 00:46:51.470
LAURA: I know; it's awkward.

00:46:51.470 --> 00:46:53.878
LAURA and MARISHA: Hi.

00:46:53.878 --> 00:46:56.112
MATT: "Hi." And he throws his spear to the side.

00:46:56.112 --> 00:46:57.660
LAURA: Oh good, I was wondering if--

00:46:57.660 --> 00:47:00.730
MARISHA: Yeah, I hope we didn't-- I hope you
weren't sleeping.

00:47:00.730 --> 00:47:09.707
MATT: "I hope I wasn't either. Sure, all right,
I'm glad you're here because it took me a long-ass

00:47:09.707 --> 00:47:16.141
"time to get here." And he sits up in the bed and--
or he sits down back on the bed and reaches over

00:47:16.141 --> 00:47:21.342
and pulls out one of his packs and brings out a
couple of rolls of paper. "Okay, so I talked to

00:47:21.342 --> 00:47:24.884
"Vanessa and got two contracts that we could take
up for this."

00:47:24.884 --> 00:47:25.847
LAURA: Okay.

00:47:25.847 --> 00:47:29.494
MATT: "We got one here," and he pulls it out,
"This is for two indigenous creatures to the

00:47:29.494 --> 00:47:34.991
"region that you were talking about over by
Wildemount. One is a purple worm matron."

00:47:34.991 --> 00:47:36.765
LAURA: Ooh, that sounds big.

00:47:36.765 --> 00:47:44.685
MATT: "Supposedly. Shit's dangerous. Careful. This
one is for a Storm Giant. This one is a little

00:47:44.685 --> 00:47:46.318
"harder to get a hold of apparently."

00:47:46.318 --> 00:47:51.022
LAURA: They're so hard to get a hold of. We should
probably focus on the other one.

00:47:51.022 --> 00:47:52.355
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.

00:47:52.355 --> 00:47:55.147
LAURA: Unless Vorugal's already dead.

00:47:55.147 --> 00:47:58.834
MARISHA: Yeah, wouldn't that be crazy if he was
already dead?

00:47:58.834 --> 00:48:02.106
LAURA: What would we do with these contracts if he
is? Just wondering about that.

00:48:02.106 --> 00:48:06.127
MATT: "Get out of my room."

00:48:06.127 --> 00:48:07.048
MARISHA: Kash.

00:48:07.048 --> 00:48:07.842
MATT: "Just get out."

00:48:07.842 --> 00:48:08.529
MARISHA: Kash.

00:48:08.529 --> 00:48:09.579
MATT: "Get out of my room."

00:48:09.579 --> 00:48:10.649
MARISHA: Look--

00:48:10.649 --> 00:48:12.029
LAURA: Your help has been--

00:48:12.029 --> 00:48:14.063
MARISHA: Not overlooked.

00:48:14.063 --> 00:48:16.847
MATT: "Out. Of my room."

00:48:16.847 --> 00:48:18.404
LAURA and MARISHA: We should probably go.

00:48:18.404 --> 00:48:19.198
LAURA: Do you want these back--

00:48:19.198 --> 00:48:20.233
MATT: "Out of my room."

00:48:20.233 --> 00:48:21.063
LAURA: I'm going to set them down on the ground.

00:48:21.063 --> 00:48:22.130
MATT: "Out of my room."

00:48:22.130 --> 00:48:22.920
MARISHA: You know, we could--

00:48:22.920 --> 00:48:24.228
MATT: "Get out of my room."

00:48:24.228 --> 00:48:28.634
LAURA: By the way, you might want to get like a
mouthguard or something because you snore a little.

00:48:28.634 --> 00:48:38.293
MATT: You leave him in silence and darkness.
(yelling) "Out of my room!"

00:48:38.293 --> 00:48:40.904
LAURA: Keyleth, we should go.

00:48:40.904 --> 00:48:44.931
MARISHA: Okay. Okay. We'll see you later.

00:48:44.931 --> 00:48:46.596
LAURA: Keyleth.

00:48:46.596 --> 00:48:47.708
MARISHA: What?

00:48:47.708 --> 00:48:49.456
LAURA: Come here.

00:48:49.456 --> 00:48:50.431
MARISHA: Okay.

00:48:50.431 --> 00:48:55.671
LAURA: And I take her around a corner. He kissed
me.

00:48:55.671 --> 00:48:57.755
MARISHA: Kash?

00:48:57.755 --> 00:48:59.595
LAURA: No! God no! Percy!

00:48:59.595 --> 00:49:00.580
MARISHA: Like right now?

00:49:00.580 --> 00:49:01.583
LAURA: Percival!

00:49:01.583 --> 00:49:02.492
MARISHA: Did I miss something?

00:49:02.492 --> 00:49:03.290
LAURA: No.

00:49:03.290 --> 00:49:04.300
MARISHA: What? Percy?

00:49:04.300 --> 00:49:05.077
LAURA: Yeah!

00:49:05.077 --> 00:49:06.025
MARISHA: (squeals)

00:49:06.025 --> 00:49:07.025
LAURA: I know.

00:49:07.025 --> 00:49:08.980
MARISHA: That's good, right?

00:49:08.980 --> 00:49:10.111
LAURA: I mean I know you guys are like--

00:49:10.111 --> 00:49:10.964
MARISHA: No!

00:49:10.964 --> 00:49:13.207
LAURA: Pretty close and I don't know if that's
weird.

00:49:13.207 --> 00:49:14.262
MARISHA: Why are you asking me?

00:49:14.262 --> 00:49:15.760
LAURA: I don't know, you're like his sister, kind
of.

00:49:15.760 --> 00:49:16.836
MARISHA: He's not my twin brother.

00:49:16.836 --> 00:49:28.146
LAURA: This is true. How are things with you and
Vax? Thanks for bringing it up. Is it good?

00:49:28.146 --> 00:49:31.726
MARISHA: I still worry if you care.

00:49:31.726 --> 00:49:33.482
LAURA: I care; of course I care.

00:49:33.482 --> 00:49:35.049
MARISHA: Yeah, you say that.

00:49:35.049 --> 00:49:42.340
LAURA: I hug her. Well not your antlers in my
face.

00:49:42.340 --> 00:49:47.234
MARISHA: Oh, sorry, sorry, that happens a lot. I'm
very happy for you.

00:49:47.234 --> 00:49:50.620
LAURA: Hey thanks. We should go look at the
treasury.

00:49:50.620 --> 00:49:54.259
MARISHA: Okay, let's go to the treasury. We should
go victory shopping.

00:49:54.259 --> 00:49:55.424
LAURA: Oh my god.

00:49:55.424 --> 00:49:56.322
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:49:56.322 --> 00:50:00.751
LAURA: Do you think he'd mind if we-- I mean we
have so much money, we don't even need to do that.

00:50:00.751 --> 00:50:04.013
MARISHA: I mean it's basically our money, though,
right?

00:50:04.101 --> 00:50:05.331
LAURA: Yeah. No. It's--

00:50:05.331 --> 00:50:06.985
MARISHA: Yeah. Okay.

00:50:06.985 --> 00:50:11.031
MATT: All right, so you guys wander your way
off--

00:50:11.031 --> 00:50:15.063
MARISHA: You know, Vex, I feel like you might be a
bad or good influence on me. I'm not sure, but I

00:50:15.063 --> 00:50:16.385
like it.

00:50:16.385 --> 00:50:17.419
LAURA: It's all good.

00:50:17.419 --> 00:50:18.274
MARISHA: Okay.

00:50:18.274 --> 00:50:19.653
MATT: Scanlan, Grog, Percival. What are you guys
doing?

00:50:19.653 --> 00:50:21.521
TALIESIN: Life is failing the Bechdel Test so hard
right now.

00:50:21.521 --> 00:50:23.195
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:50:23.195 --> 00:50:24.227
LAURA: So bad.

00:50:24.227 --> 00:50:26.088
TALIESIN: Sorry. (laughs) Carry on.

00:50:26.088 --> 00:50:29.724
LAURA: Sometimes they do talk about boys.

00:50:29.724 --> 00:50:34.807
MARISHA: They are like 50% of--

00:50:34.807 --> 00:50:37.515
TALIESIN: No, I did not see that coming.

00:50:37.515 --> 00:50:41.492
TRAVIS: We don't really need to like check in with
anything.

00:50:41.492 --> 00:50:45.581
SAM: You mean do you have the gold?

00:50:45.581 --> 00:50:47.856
TRAVIS: Well I mean I-- yeah.

00:50:47.856 --> 00:50:49.698
SAM: We should probably divvy it up, don't you
think?

00:50:49.698 --> 00:50:51.126
TRAVIS: What? What? What?

00:50:51.126 --> 00:50:52.130
TALIESIN: No, no, no.

00:50:52.130 --> 00:50:54.970
TRAVIS: But it's really a lot to hold onto your
person. I mean, it's a bag of gold--

00:50:54.970 --> 00:50:56.648
SAM: No, but we should all replenish our
personal--

00:50:56.648 --> 00:50:58.402
TALIESIN: You can have some pocket money, but--

00:50:58.402 --> 00:50:59.346
SAM: Yes, yes, yes.

00:50:59.346 --> 00:51:00.968
TRAVIS: Yeah. How much do you want? You don't have
it. I have it.

00:51:00.968 --> 00:51:03.254
SAM: 5000. We have hundreds.

00:51:03.254 --> 00:51:06.440
TRAVIS: Yeah, if you want 5000. Do you have good
credit?

00:51:06.440 --> 00:51:07.904
SAM: Do I have good credit?

00:51:07.904 --> 00:51:08.777
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:51:08.777 --> 00:51:11.237
SAM: I've never misspent a single coin.

00:51:11.237 --> 00:51:13.238
TRAVIS: Can I have your last four pay stubs,
please?

00:51:13.238 --> 00:51:15.608
(laughter)

00:51:15.608 --> 00:51:17.175
SAM: Here's two of them right here.

00:51:17.175 --> 00:51:20.100
TRAVIS: Hey! That's good enough! Have 5000 gold!

00:51:20.100 --> 00:51:24.976
MATT: As Grog gives you 5000 gold, which weighs
roughly a hundred pounds--

00:51:24.976 --> 00:51:25.778
SAM: Shit!

00:51:25.778 --> 00:51:27.226
MATT: It weighs more than you do.

00:51:27.226 --> 00:51:29.196
LAURA: 5000 gold is a hundred pounds?

00:51:29.196 --> 00:51:30.753
TRAVIS: And it's probably about 1000 because I
can't count to 5000.

00:51:30.753 --> 00:51:34.798
MATT: Yeah. He starts divvying it out until it's
like larger than you in a pile in the center of

00:51:34.798 --> 00:51:35.797
the room.

00:51:35.797 --> 00:51:37.112
TALIESIN: Well what are you going to do with it?

00:51:37.112 --> 00:51:38.513
SAM: All right, all right. I'm going to give some
back.

00:51:38.513 --> 00:51:39.379
TRAVIS: Are you really?

00:51:39.379 --> 00:51:40.891
SAM: Why don't you give me ten platinum.

00:51:40.891 --> 00:51:42.221
TALIESIN: No! Absolutely--

00:51:42.221 --> 00:51:44.064
SAM: (chuckles) It's the same! It's the same!

00:51:44.064 --> 00:51:45.059
TRAVIS: Why not?

00:51:45.059 --> 00:51:46.098
LIAM: Ten platinum?

00:51:46.098 --> 00:51:47.957
TALIESIN: Ten platinum is an awful lot.

00:51:47.957 --> 00:51:49.496
TRAVIS: But he can carry ten. That's easier.

00:51:49.496 --> 00:51:50.506
LIAM: Sure.

00:51:50.506 --> 00:51:52.590
TRAVIS: Hold on, let me consult Blackstone.

00:51:52.590 --> 00:51:54.274
LIAM: Ten or ten thousand?

00:51:54.274 --> 00:51:56.266
TALIESIN: (stage whisper) Don't do it!

00:51:56.266 --> 00:51:59.391
TRAVIS: Yep. Stoneblack says it's all right.

00:51:59.391 --> 00:52:01.461
SAM: You're with us. You're with us.

00:52:01.461 --> 00:52:02.362
TALIESIN: I am!

00:52:02.362 --> 00:52:03.743
TRAVIS: I take the gold. I put it back in.

00:52:03.743 --> 00:52:04.486
TALIESIN: No!

00:52:04.486 --> 00:52:06.166
TRAVIS: And I give him ten platinum, which is
actually six.

00:52:06.166 --> 00:52:09.336
MATT: So you get six platinum from Grog, which is
roughly sixty gold.

00:52:09.336 --> 00:52:12.634
TRAVIS: One. Three. Seven. Eight. Nine. 40. Ten.

00:52:12.634 --> 00:52:14.300
SAM: That's it?

00:52:14.300 --> 00:52:15.212
TRAVIS: Yep.

00:52:15.212 --> 00:52:16.186
TALIESIN: Excellent.

00:52:16.186 --> 00:52:17.677
SAM: And give me 500 gold, as well.

00:52:17.677 --> 00:52:18.595
TALIESIN: No!

00:52:18.595 --> 00:52:19.717
SAM: Of course. I need money.

00:52:19.717 --> 00:52:22.463
TRAVIS: It's really heavy. How about I give you 20
more platinum?

00:52:22.463 --> 00:52:24.044
SAM: Great. That sounds good.

00:52:24.044 --> 00:52:25.299
TRAVIS: And I give him four more.

00:52:25.299 --> 00:52:27.581
SAM: (laughs) Give me 50 more platinum.

00:52:27.581 --> 00:52:29.245
TRAVIS: 50?

00:52:29.245 --> 00:52:30.064
SAM: Yes.

00:52:30.064 --> 00:52:31.073
TRAVIS: All right. I give you one more.

00:52:31.073 --> 00:52:34.516
SAM: Thank you. 11 platinum.

00:52:34.516 --> 00:52:36.696
MATT: Perfect.

00:52:36.696 --> 00:52:41.361
TALIESIN: I'm going to try to find Allura. I'm
going to leave them to their madness. I'm going to

00:52:41.361 --> 00:52:46.730
try and find Allura and Cassandra or anybody I can
find in the castle at this point.

00:52:46.730 --> 00:52:52.794
MATT: Okay. As you walk around, nobody else who's
supposed to be meeting has gathered yet. However,

00:52:52.794 --> 00:52:58.468
Cassandra is awake and in the process of going
through some papers. She has her personal guard at

00:52:58.468 --> 00:53:03.318
her side and two guards at the door and you can
see she's getting herself prepared for the

00:53:03.318 --> 00:53:08.126
meeting. As you enter the room, the door partially
ajar, you see her still down currently thumbing

00:53:08.126 --> 00:53:13.100
through notes. Her hair is still in disarray and
pulled back haphazardly. And she's wearing her

00:53:13.100 --> 00:53:20.654
morning gown and without even looking up goes,
"Percival. Glad you've arrived and still in one piece."

00:53:20.654 --> 00:53:23.110
TALIESIN: Yes. And down one dragon.

00:53:23.110 --> 00:53:28.805
MATT: "I have to tell you, I'm very impressed."

00:53:28.805 --> 00:53:37.538
TALIESIN: Thank you. Two more to go. It's going to
get a little heavier at this point.

00:53:37.538 --> 00:53:42.338
MATT: "Indeed. That's what our meeting is about."

00:53:42.338 --> 00:53:44.756
IPHONE: What was that, again?

00:53:44.756 --> 00:53:46.755
TALIESIN: What was that, again?

00:53:46.755 --> 00:53:52.749
MATT: "Sorry, I need to go fire some of my guards.
They're making a nuisance. Continue, please."

00:53:52.749 --> 00:54:00.165
TALIESIN: Two more to go. I fear that it's
possible that Whitestone itself may eventually be

00:54:00.165 --> 00:54:03.574
a target of an attack. I feel it may be
inevitable.

00:54:03.574 --> 00:54:08.687
MATT: "That is, actually, what our meeting is
about. Prevent that from happening."

00:54:08.687 --> 00:54:16.667
TALIESIN: Quickly to check. I would know what
languages Cassandra spoke, correct?

00:54:16.667 --> 00:54:19.918
MATT: What languages do you know?

00:54:19.918 --> 00:54:21.529
TALIESIN: Elven, Celestial, Common.

00:54:21.529 --> 00:54:23.176
MATT: She knows Elven and Common. She does not
know Celestial.

00:54:23.176 --> 00:54:23.959
TALIESIN: Okay.

00:54:23.959 --> 00:54:24.898
MATT: That was more your hobby.

00:54:24.898 --> 00:54:27.166
TALIESIN: I figured. That was my guess. I wanted
to confirm.

00:54:27.166 --> 00:54:28.187
MATT: Yeah.

00:54:28.187 --> 00:54:34.593
TALIESIN: I hand her a small slip of paper that I
have written in Elven: "Be prepared for anything

00:54:34.593 --> 00:54:37.871
"today. Keep silent."

00:54:37.871 --> 00:54:45.453
MATT: She gives you a very keen look. And you can
see Cassandra. As much as she is the healthiest

00:54:45.453 --> 00:54:49.799
you've seen her physically, her eyes have dark
circles over them. It looks like she's been very

00:54:49.799 --> 00:54:59.337
harried by the events of these past few weeks.
Understandably so. But she takes and looks over

00:54:59.337 --> 00:55:04.566
the sheet and goes, "Well, very well. Should be an
interesting meeting then."

00:55:04.566 --> 00:55:06.312
TALIESIN: I think so.

00:55:06.312 --> 00:55:13.985
I do think so. It's good to see you taking
command.

00:55:13.985 --> 00:55:18.019
MATT: "It's good to see you, and I look forward to 
you sharing some of the burden soon."

00:55:18.102 --> 00:55:18.876
TALIESIN: Yes.

00:55:18.876 --> 00:55:19.849
MATT: "Right?"

00:55:19.849 --> 00:55:21.601
TALIESIN: Quite possibly.

00:55:21.601 --> 00:55:23.141
MATT: "Right?"

00:55:23.141 --> 00:55:28.526
TALIESIN: We will discuss whence the 
dragons are taken care of.

00:55:28.526 --> 00:55:29.668
MATT: "Good."

00:55:29.668 --> 00:55:32.963
TALIESIN: We will discuss, at
the very least, relieving you of some of this

00:55:32.963 --> 00:55:34.535
burden.

00:55:34.535 --> 00:55:35.586
MATT: "Good."

00:55:35.586 --> 00:55:36.975
TALIESIN: I know it is not fair.

00:55:36.975 --> 00:55:41.610
MATT: "Whatever is fair in this life? The
wonders of lordship and ladydom."

00:55:41.610 --> 00:55:45.456
SAM: I'm going to run off and try to find Jarett.

00:55:45.456 --> 00:55:48.959
MATT: Okay. Do you wish to come? Anything 
else you want to bring to this conversation?

00:55:48.959 --> 00:55:55.768
TALIESIN: No, I'm fine with that. My last thing is,
I'm going to quickly run and have a quick conversation

00:55:55.768 --> 00:56:03.772
privately with-- I assume we have some sort of royal jeweler
of some kind, or somebody who does some of

00:56:03.772 --> 00:56:05.001
the ornamental work.

00:56:05.001 --> 00:56:08.421
MATT: No one who lives on site per se, but
there are two individuals that your family

00:56:08.421 --> 00:56:12.799
generally used for various forms of jewel
craft.

00:56:12.799 --> 00:56:14.687
TALIESIN: I'm going to write and send a
letter off for that.

00:56:14.687 --> 00:56:17.157
MATT: Okay. No worries. Scanlan, what are you 
going to do? Looking for Jarett?

00:56:17.157 --> 00:56:18.487
SAM: Looking for Jarett.

00:56:18.487 --> 00:56:22.434
MATT: Okay. You head outside of the main 
castle, down to where the

00:56:22.434 --> 00:56:29.572
training barracks are for Whitestone. And you can
see Jarett's already out there, with a small,

00:56:29.572 --> 00:56:35.629
metallic platter on his lap, scarfing up some food
real fast. He's gotten his day started relatively

00:56:35.629 --> 00:56:40.385
early and as soon as you approach, mouth's already
full. "Mmm! Scanlan! It's good to see you."

00:56:40.385 --> 00:56:43.571
SAM: Good to see you too! What're you
enjoying there?

00:56:43.571 --> 00:56:48.660
MATT: (laughs) "The usual gruel that you
find in this city."

00:56:48.660 --> 00:56:52.924
SAM: Oh, I thought it might be something, 
meat-based that you could have popped

00:56:52.924 --> 00:56:55.230
up a bit with your spice.

00:56:55.230 --> 00:56:57.990
MATT: "Oh, well trust me, I've used it on 
the eggs and it makes it

00:56:57.990 --> 00:57:04.739
"bearable. Whitestone is not well known for its
cuisine from what I can tell. Everything's gray

00:57:04.782 --> 00:57:06.521
"and lacks flavor."

00:57:06.521 --> 00:57:12.024
SAM: I'll invite you over to my house some 
time, give you a proper chicken dinner.

00:57:12.024 --> 00:57:15.157
MATT: "All right, I will happily take you
up on that offer, thank you."

00:57:15.157 --> 00:57:18.938
SAM: Wanted to check in on (lowers voice) the
task we talked about?

00:57:18.938 --> 00:57:21.426
MATT: "The task?"

00:57:21.461 --> 00:57:27.410
SAM: You know, the mission we discussed.

00:57:27.410 --> 00:57:30.444
MATT: "Remind me again?"

00:57:30.444 --> 00:57:41.313
SAM: I don't want to talk about it out in the open.
But you know there was some illicit--

00:57:41.313 --> 00:57:42.957
MATT: "Oh!"

00:57:42.957 --> 00:57:46.801
SAM: Items of medicine.

00:57:46.801 --> 00:57:52.706
MATT: "Yes, I sent a request through
someone I know."

00:57:52.706 --> 00:57:56.617
SAM: &lt;i&gt;Sent a request?!&lt;/i&gt; You're using other people?
I trust you, I don't trust other people!

00:57:56.617 --> 00:58:04.398
MATT: "I'm not going to leave the city right now to
go find-- Look, I have two

00:58:04.398 --> 00:58:06.997
"people I know that might be able to get what you
need. But it's going to take time."

00:58:06.997 --> 00:58:10.685
SAM: (sighs) I don't have time. (sighs)

00:58:10.685 --> 00:58:14.517
MATT: "When did you pick up this habit?!
I'm worried about you now, Scanlan."

00:58:14.517 --> 00:58:18.117
SAM: I haven't picked it up. I'm trying to pick it up,
damn it! It's the most difficult

00:58:18.117 --> 00:58:24.138
habit to pick up! Listen, can I confide in you,
man to man, one on one, here?

00:58:24.138 --> 00:58:25.680
MATT: "Certainly."

00:58:25.680 --> 00:58:30.777
SAM: You're a fighter, you're a strapping young
battle man, aren't you?

00:58:30.777 --> 00:58:33.766
MATT: (chuckles) "I have been told this once or twice,
yes."

00:58:33.766 --> 00:58:39.705
SAM: I haven't felt myself recently. You
know, we have these fights and some of them are

00:58:39.705 --> 00:58:45.431
pretty epic and there's monsters involved and I'm
usually on my game, but lately I'm feeling a

00:58:45.431 --> 00:58:48.410
little off! How do &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; cope with that?

00:58:48.410 --> 00:58:55.090
MATT: "Well largely by not using illicit
substances?!"

00:58:55.090 --> 00:58:56.377
SAM: Don't judge! Don't judge.

00:58:56.377 --> 00:58:59.110
MATT: "I'm not judging! I'm worried about
you. Like, if you don't even have a habit, why

00:58:59.110 --> 00:59:02.104
"would you look for this? The Scanlan I knew, the
one that hired me,

00:59:02.104 --> 00:59:06.584
"he knew how to deal with this issue. 
He got &lt;i&gt;laid.&lt;/i&gt;"

00:59:06.584 --> 00:59:09.339
SAM: I don't really do that much anymore.

00:59:09.339 --> 00:59:12.163
MATT: "Maybe that's why you're not
feeling up to the task?" (laughs)

00:59:12.163 --> 00:59:14.332
SAM: That is a very fair point, Jarett.

00:59:14.332 --> 00:59:19.391
MATT: "I'm just saying. Look, and I do not 
mean to talk out of turn." He

00:59:19.391 --> 00:59:30.258
sets his meal aside. "But you are a man who
walks, driven by his pelvis. Am I wrong?"

00:59:30.258 --> 00:59:32.241
SAM: You're not wrong.

00:59:32.241 --> 00:59:41.129
MATT: "Then what happens if the
pelvis goes unused? Grows bashful?"

00:59:41.129 --> 00:59:42.635
TRAVIS: Preach.

00:59:42.635 --> 00:59:51.714
SAM: Like a fine instrument, it can go
untuned. If you leave a fine violin without

00:59:51.714 --> 00:59:59.197
playing it for many years, it could wither and rot
until you need to replace some of the parts. In a

00:59:59.197 --> 01:00:07.384
way, the same is true for my member. But the
problem here, Jarett, is that I'm distracted. I'm

01:00:07.384 --> 01:00:11.924
distracted by things that haven't ever distracted
me before. I've made a promise to someone to stay

01:00:11.924 --> 01:00:21.157
alive. I've never valued my own life before and
when we get into the shit, I'm second-guessing

01:00:21.157 --> 01:00:26.423
things. I'm making stupid decisions that I
wouldn't have otherwise made.

01:00:26.423 --> 01:00:31.047
MATT: "Because suddenly you have purpose. Because
you have a reason to come back."

01:00:31.047 --> 01:00:32.411
SAM: Yes.

01:00:32.411 --> 01:00:35.623
MATT: "That's not a bad thing, then."

01:00:35.623 --> 01:00:39.127
SAM: I don't know how to harness that kind of
stress.

01:00:39.127 --> 01:00:46.627
MATT: "Do you have a keepsake of this reason to
return, this person you made a promise to?"

01:00:46.627 --> 01:00:51.685
SAM: Do I have a keepsake? I don't think so.

01:00:51.685 --> 01:00:54.027
MATT: "Then you need to get yourself a keepsake!"

01:00:54.027 --> 01:01:00.567
SAM: Well she's not around right now to get a
keepsake from.

01:01:00.567 --> 01:01:06.959
MATT: "Then something else that reminds you of
her. Something that you can look at in that

01:01:06.959 --> 01:01:08.605
"moment when you're not so sure."

01:01:08.605 --> 01:01:10.750
SAM: How did you get so wise, Jarett?

01:01:10.750 --> 01:01:16.016
MATT: "Drink a lot, listen to people talk. There
are none wiser than barkeeps, my friend, and I

01:01:16.016 --> 01:01:18.604
"have been friends with many a barkeep."

01:01:18.604 --> 01:01:25.543
SAM: These are all good suggestions. But I'm a man
of instinct, and my instincts said I need to

01:01:25.543 --> 01:01:33.574
supplement my body with some extra liquid courage.
So if you can please continue to look for me.

01:01:33.574 --> 01:01:39.796
MATT: "I will continue searching and providing
what you require."

01:01:39.796 --> 01:01:43.224
SAM: I've heard that it can help people in moments
of panic and stress.

01:01:43.224 --> 01:01:46.484
MATT: "And I've watched it ruin lives near K'Tawl
Swamp!"

01:01:46.484 --> 01:01:48.855
SAM: I can handle a lot of things.

01:01:48.855 --> 01:01:52.262
MATT: "You are a strange gnome."

01:01:52.262 --> 01:01:54.979
SAM: Takes one to know one?

01:01:54.979 --> 01:02:02.753
MATT: "Does not work in this circumstance but I
applaud your attempt. It was good. I'll do what I

01:02:02.753 --> 01:02:08.102
"can. But don't forget you have more than one
reason to stick around."

01:02:08.102 --> 01:02:16.771
SAM: I know. That's what worries me. I'll think
about what you said. Maybe I'll go have a toss,

01:02:16.771 --> 01:02:18.830
see if that helps, too.

01:02:18.830 --> 01:02:20.794
MATT: "Here, tell you what. Come here."

01:02:20.794 --> 01:02:28.567
SAM: Yes?

01:02:28.567 --> 01:02:36.329
MATT: And he suckerpunches you in the face. You
unexpectedly fall back. You feel the pulsing of

01:02:36.329 --> 01:02:42.709
the blood run to your cheek. Your eyesight goes
white for a second. He goes, "See, now you have to

01:02:42.709 --> 01:02:44.682
"live to return the favor."

01:02:44.682 --> 01:02:51.612
SAM: You! That was clever. I will definitely get
you back.

01:02:51.612 --> 01:02:53.576
MATT: "Good. I look forward to it."

01:02:53.576 --> 01:02:55.200
SAM: Watch your back.

01:02:55.200 --> 01:02:56.952
MATT: "I always do."

01:02:56.952 --> 01:02:59.406
SAM: Get me some drugs!

01:02:59.406 --> 01:03:09.474
MATT: Awesome. Grog.

01:03:09.474 --> 01:03:12.166
TRAVIS: It's daytime, right?

01:03:12.166 --> 01:03:14.310
MATT: Yeah, it's early morning.

01:03:14.310 --> 01:03:21.106
TRAVIS: Is there a way I can find a courtyard or
an open-air area?

01:03:21.106 --> 01:03:25.278
MATT: There are a couple of courtyards within the
perimeter walls of the castle. They have some

01:03:25.278 --> 01:03:26.860
small garden elements.

01:03:26.860 --> 01:03:29.829
TRAVIS: If I get there, are there a lot of guards
keeping an eye?

01:03:29.829 --> 01:03:32.780
MATT: Not within the courtyard, no. Occasionally,
there'll be one patrolling.

01:03:32.780 --> 01:03:35.482
TRAVIS: Can I pee in the courtyard?

01:03:35.482 --> 01:03:37.724
MATT: By all means!

01:03:37.724 --> 01:03:43.291
TRAVIS: I feel like I need to mark my territory.
This is home for us, and I peed all over Greyskull

01:03:43.291 --> 01:03:49.536
Keep. I left little puddles that y'all didn't know
about. It's real important in case other goliaths

01:03:49.536 --> 01:03:54.084
come around and are like, (sniff) "Nope, the
wolf's here. I got to go elsewhere."

01:03:54.084 --> 01:03:56.881
TALIESIN: I assumed it was shoddy masonry and
everything was leaking.

01:03:56.881 --> 01:04:01.264
TRAVIS: No, stealth roll, motherfucker. Can I take
a leak on a wall in the courtyard?

01:04:01.264 --> 01:04:05.329
MATT: Yeah and there are a number of walls to
choose from: varying heights, different levels of

01:04:05.329 --> 01:04:08.435
masonry. You have the veritable pick of the
litter.

01:04:08.435 --> 01:04:18.683
TRAVIS: Can I find the highest wall with the most
ornate decoration on it and go slightly off left?

01:04:18.683 --> 01:04:26.721
The way me member goes and make a little box right
there? A little waterfall on the whitestone.

01:04:26.721 --> 01:04:32.673
MATT: Certainly. You find the portion where the
exterior wall has one little parapet-joining

01:04:32.673 --> 01:04:38.884
portion with the exterior of the castle itself.
There, you can see the masonry is fine, the stones

01:04:38.884 --> 01:04:44.177
themselves are clean-cut and joined properly.
There isn't a whole lot in the way of ornate

01:04:44.177 --> 01:04:48.754
craftsmanship on the exterior of the castle or the
walls, but you feel, as far as your interest,

01:04:48.754 --> 01:04:51.555
Grog, this is a good wall.

01:04:51.555 --> 01:04:52.505
TRAVIS: Very nice.

01:04:52.505 --> 01:04:54.286
MATT: You mark your territory expertly.

01:04:54.286 --> 01:04:59.078
TRAVIS: In a wide, arcing pattern, not like the
one shot, like a nice, upside-down crown.

01:04:59.078 --> 01:05:06.082
MATT: There you go, like a Cylon eyebeam. Yeah,
totally. You do so with gusto. Congratulations.

01:05:06.082 --> 01:05:08.785
TRAVIS: Thank you. Home.

01:05:08.785 --> 01:05:12.380
MATT: That's how Grog spells home.

01:05:12.380 --> 01:05:14.395
MARISHA: Stellar RP.

01:05:14.395 --> 01:05:16.242
TRAVIS: How else do you spell home?

01:05:16.242 --> 01:05:20.339
MATT: Unless there's anything else that needs to
be done--

01:05:20.339 --> 01:05:23.432
LIAM: I'm not done with my errands. Can I go find
Kynan?

01:05:23.432 --> 01:05:33.727
MATT: You can. Kynan, who is currently under the
watch of Jarett at the moment, is asleep. You

01:05:33.727 --> 01:05:38.391
start walking towards the direction as Scanlan is
leaving the exterior of the barrack training

01:05:38.391 --> 01:05:39.428
grounds.

01:05:39.428 --> 01:05:40.507
LIAM: Hey, buddy.

01:05:40.507 --> 01:05:41.286
SAM: Hi.

01:05:41.286 --> 01:05:43.349
LIAM: You look a little rough. You all right?

01:05:43.349 --> 01:05:47.844
SAM: I'm fine. One of our employees punched me in
the face.

01:05:47.844 --> 01:05:50.617
LIAM: Which one?

01:05:50.617 --> 01:05:54.341
SAM: You don't want to know. It wasn't the cooking
cook.

01:05:54.341 --> 01:05:59.524
LIAM: You look really tense. You look out of
character.

01:05:59.524 --> 01:06:02.898
SAM: (growls)

01:06:02.898 --> 01:06:13.609
LIAM: Oh dear. Head back. We're going to have that
meeting soon. Get your game face on, yeah?

01:06:13.609 --> 01:06:18.153
SAM: I will. I'll wash my face. Get to it.

01:06:18.153 --> 01:06:19.545
LIAM: All right.

01:06:19.545 --> 01:06:20.992
SAM: How are you doing?

01:06:20.992 --> 01:06:22.641
LIAM: I'm good.

01:06:22.641 --> 01:06:23.970
SAM: Yeah?

01:06:23.970 --> 01:06:25.512
LIAM: Best I've been in a while.

01:06:25.512 --> 01:06:33.853
SAM: That's good to hear. It's been a while since
we had one of our depressing chats. You seem a

01:06:33.853 --> 01:06:37.777
little more chipper these days. Coming around to
my perspective, are you?

01:06:37.777 --> 01:06:42.132
LIAM: Can I make an insight check?

01:06:42.132 --> 01:06:43.229
MATT: Yeah, make an insight check.

01:06:43.229 --> 01:06:46.870
LIAM: Seems full of shit to me. I'm going to use
luck. I've got it.

01:06:46.870 --> 01:06:48.174
TRAVIS: That's your second luck!

01:06:48.174 --> 01:06:55.095
LIAM: Who cares? This is a game. I'm with my
friends. I'm having fun. That is an 18.

01:06:55.095 --> 01:06:59.000
MATT: 18. Are you deceiving him any?

01:06:59.000 --> 01:06:59.982
SAM: No! Not at all.

01:06:59.982 --> 01:07:03.614
LIAM: But does he seem confident and happy is what
I wanted to know.

01:07:03.614 --> 01:07:06.201
MATT: As much as he would in the given situation,
yeah.

01:07:06.201 --> 01:07:15.982
LIAM: All right. (sighs) I'm happy. I'm in love.

01:07:15.982 --> 01:07:18.250
SAM: Really?

01:07:18.250 --> 01:07:20.289
LIAM: Yeah.

01:07:20.289 --> 01:07:22.244
SAM: Do I know the fella?

01:07:22.244 --> 01:07:27.827
LIAM: Yeah. I'll tell you later, all right?

01:07:27.827 --> 01:07:32.820
SAM: I want to hear details! Dirty, dirty details!
Sweaty details!

01:07:32.820 --> 01:07:37.577
LIAM: Oh, he is so hung. Unbelievably hung.

01:07:37.577 --> 01:07:39.828
MARISHA: So much dick talk!

01:07:39.828 --> 01:07:45.892
LIAM: I'll tell you later. I have to run an
errand. We have to get to this fucking meeting, yeah?

01:07:45.892 --> 01:07:48.156
SAM: Oh yeah. I'll see you there. Game face on.

01:07:48.156 --> 01:07:50.237
MARISHA: Is this how they talk themselves up?

01:07:50.237 --> 01:07:53.463
TRAVIS: Yeah, don't women talk about their
vaginas?

01:07:53.463 --> 01:07:58.227
LIAM: I'm talking about your goddamn antlers.
Jeepers. Off I go.

01:07:58.227 --> 01:08:00.121
SAM: Locker room talk.

01:08:00.121 --> 01:08:01.029
LAURA: Oh.

01:08:01.029 --> 01:08:03.018
(laughter)

01:08:03.018 --> 01:08:04.513
LIAM: (yells) No!

01:08:04.513 --> 01:08:13.977
MATT: The campaign is over. Whitestone burns in
flames. You make your way there. Jarett, you can

01:08:13.977 --> 01:08:19.085
see, finishing a meal. Looks over to you. There's
nobody else in the training area. It's still

01:08:19.085 --> 01:08:25.926
relatively early. You do, with your perception,
see back on the main stone building, you see a few

01:08:25.926 --> 01:08:30.146
individuals walking back and forth in front of one
of the windows. It looks like things are starting

01:08:30.146 --> 01:08:32.671
up over there for training for the day. Jarett
finishes his meal, scarfs up the last bit of egg

01:08:32.671 --> 01:08:34.786
on the side of the plate, "Hey!"

01:08:34.786 --> 01:08:35.928
LIAM: Jarett!

01:08:35.928 --> 01:08:36.806
MATT: "Yes!"

01:08:36.806 --> 01:08:41.559
LIAM: Hey, I don't want to interrupt. Kynan, the
new guy. Is he around?

01:08:41.559 --> 01:08:44.354
MATT: "Probably inside, sleeping or waking."

01:08:44.354 --> 01:08:45.862
LIAM: Okay if I go in?

01:08:45.862 --> 01:08:47.778
MATT: "Sure. This way."

01:08:47.816 --> 01:08:48.997
LIAM: Just be a minute.

01:08:48.997 --> 01:08:55.809
MATT: "Sure, go for it." He sits back down. You
head inside. The door's not locked. You open it.

01:08:55.809 --> 01:09:01.015
You see ten different individuals that are all in
the process of waking up. You can smell coffee.

01:09:01.015 --> 01:09:07.680
Very basic breakfast meats being cooked. Some of
them are around tables talking, hunched forward

01:09:07.680 --> 01:09:11.846
and laughing. As soon as you walk in, a few of
them turn and look at you. Some don't recognize

01:09:11.846 --> 01:09:18.673
you, some do. You see, in the far corner sitting
alone at one of the tables is Kynan, who is

01:09:18.673 --> 01:09:24.159
prison-style guarding his food and eating by
himself.

01:09:24.159 --> 01:09:30.210
LIAM: Right towards him. Hey.

01:09:30.210 --> 01:09:32.132
MATT: "Hello."

01:09:32.132 --> 01:09:34.439
LIAM: How are you fitting in?

01:09:34.439 --> 01:09:44.003
MATT: "All right. Everyone here's been fine."

01:09:44.003 --> 01:09:45.727
LIAM: You hanging back?

01:09:45.727 --> 01:09:53.159
MATT: "I mean, as much as I need to. This is still
a lot. Jarett's been good. He's been watching."

01:09:53.159 --> 01:10:08.200
LIAM: He's a good man. Yeah, I get it. We killed
another dragon.

01:10:08.200 --> 01:10:12.717
MATT: "That-- wow."

01:10:12.717 --> 01:10:19.437
LIAM: Yeah. I don't want you to question your
decision here, all right?

01:10:19.437 --> 01:10:28.596
MATT: "No, I mean-- I don't have anything else
right now really. So, what's the question?"

01:10:28.596 --> 01:10:35.274
LIAM: There's no question. But if you could, I
have two favors I want to ask.

01:10:35.274 --> 01:10:36.650
MATT: "Okay."

01:10:36.650 --> 01:10:43.806
LIAM: First one is, after I leave here today,
could you embrace these people?

01:10:43.806 --> 01:10:48.610
MATT: "Yeah, I'm trying."

01:10:48.610 --> 01:10:55.790
LIAM: Yeah, I know, and I know you have
reservations, and I know that you've got guilt.

01:10:55.790 --> 01:11:06.108
When I walk out of here, I want you to work on
letting go of that. For real! Leap of faith kind

01:11:06.108 --> 01:11:08.241
of shit. Just let go of it.

01:11:08.241 --> 01:11:11.684
MATT: (sighs) "Well, I'll do my best."

01:11:11.684 --> 01:11:17.937
LIAM: I know. Scratch that, three favors.

01:11:17.937 --> 01:11:22.350
MATT: He looks down a little bit for a second
seeming like "oh boy."

01:11:22.350 --> 01:11:28.773
LIAM: Yeah, I know I'm a handful. The second one,
I don't even need for you to say anything about

01:11:28.773 --> 01:11:34.449
this, but you know the white-haired guy I travel
with?

01:11:34.449 --> 01:11:36.365
MATT: "Yeah."

01:11:36.365 --> 01:11:46.572
LIAM: Yeah. He's got a sister, and I don't want
you to do anything other than keep an eye on her

01:11:46.572 --> 01:11:48.695
and keep her safe.

01:11:48.695 --> 01:11:52.803
MATT: "Okay?"

01:11:52.803 --> 01:12:10.293
LIAM: We're going into the lion's den. Soon, I
think. And we'll probably come out of it, but just

01:12:10.293 --> 01:12:21.664
in case. She's got a lot on her shoulders; you
know that. So just keep an eye on her. That's it.

01:12:21.664 --> 01:12:24.843
All right?

01:12:24.843 --> 01:12:26.608
MATT: "All right."

01:12:26.608 --> 01:12:33.411
LIAM: And the last thing. You've got those knives
I gave you, right?

01:12:33.411 --> 01:12:34.803
MATT: "Yeah."

01:12:34.803 --> 01:12:41.572
LIAM: Yeah, hold onto them. I trust you. I need
you to watch after one last thing thing for me,

01:12:41.572 --> 01:13:00.282
all right? It's &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt; important. I wake up Simon,
and I let him crawl down my arm. Do you see this guy?

01:13:00.282 --> 01:13:02.404
MATT: "Yeah."

01:13:02.404 --> 01:13:11.572
LIAM: He's been with me through a lot, and I don't
want him at the bottom of a ditch.

01:13:11.572 --> 01:13:16.100
MATT: "Are you sure?"

01:13:16.100 --> 01:13:24.528
LIAM: I have never been more sure of anything in
my life. I want you to have him, and I want you to

01:13:24.528 --> 01:13:26.849
take care of him.

01:13:26.849 --> 01:13:32.215
MATT: "I'll do that. It'll be done. I promise."

01:13:32.215 --> 01:13:40.135
LIAM: Kynan, I need you to believe in second
chances.

01:13:40.135 --> 01:13:48.859
MATT: "It's all I have to keep me going right
now." He reaches his hand up towards the snake,

01:13:48.859 --> 01:13:55.832
and Simon leaps from from your hand to his and
swirls down his arm. He looks confused for a

01:13:55.832 --> 01:14:04.379
second as it wraps around his waist and then forms
into the shape of a belt. You now see a few other

01:14:04.379 --> 01:14:07.299
guys in the room, and the room's got a little bit
quieter. They're all watching what's happening,

01:14:07.299 --> 01:14:14.205
"What's going on?" He notices the attention and,
"I'll take good care of him."

01:14:14.205 --> 01:14:16.511
LIAM: I believe you.

01:14:16.511 --> 01:14:24.613
MATT: "I mean no offense. It's a lot of attention
right now."

01:14:24.613 --> 01:14:35.663
LIAM: I give a slap on his cheek. Remember
everything I said, all right?

01:14:35.663 --> 01:14:38.587
MATT: "Yeah, I will."

01:14:38.587 --> 01:14:43.167
LIAM: You're a good kid. (whack)

01:14:43.167 --> 01:14:50.603
MATT: (soft chuckle) "Same temple."

01:14:50.603 --> 01:14:55.796
LIAM: I'll see you later, all right?

01:14:55.796 --> 01:15:09.678
MATT: "Yeah. Definitely." And you head out. Okay.
At this point in time, a number of pages have been

01:15:09.678 --> 01:15:13.452
sent throughout the city to gather those who've
been wandering about Whitestone, as you are being

01:15:13.452 --> 01:15:17.805
called to the meeting in the second floor war room
held within the castle itself.

01:15:17.805 --> 01:15:19.668
MARISHA: Second floor?

01:15:19.668 --> 01:15:22.084
MATT: Same one where you met with--

01:15:22.084 --> 01:15:26.498
MARISHA: Asum? That'll do. All right.

01:15:26.498 --> 01:15:29.130
TALIESIN: Be ready for anything.

01:15:29.130 --> 01:15:34.608
TRAVIS: Let's go Krogering! The best of
everything!

01:15:34.608 --> 01:15:42.033
MARISHA: Before we walk in, I grab Grog. How do
you do it?

01:15:42.033 --> 01:15:43.759
TRAVIS: Do what?

01:15:43.759 --> 01:15:50.550
MARISHA: You're able to utilize your rage when
necessary. How do you keep it suppressed when it's

01:15:50.550 --> 01:15:52.550
not needed?

01:15:52.550 --> 01:15:56.018
TRAVIS: Ah. Well, good question.

01:15:56.018 --> 01:15:59.517
MARISHA: Please enlighten me, Professor Grog.

01:15:59.517 --> 01:16:06.911
TRAVIS: Right. It all comes down to one word,
really. (clears throat) Family. Right, before I

01:16:06.911 --> 01:16:16.121
was a part of this group, I had no family. Pike
took me in, I met all of you. And I had a purpose.

01:16:16.121 --> 01:16:25.694
So before that, I would be down to fuck anything
up, anytime, no problem. I still kind of am. But I

01:16:25.694 --> 01:16:33.777
realized that if I fly off the handle too soon, it
screws over my family. That's no good, because I

01:16:33.777 --> 01:16:36.887
care about you. Most of you.

01:16:36.887 --> 01:16:39.584
(laughter)

01:16:39.584 --> 01:16:46.560
TRAVIS: You're going to get yours. It's coming.
And I'm going to help you. And I'm going to high

01:16:46.560 --> 01:16:55.293
five you when it's done. But until then, you keep
that shit tucked inside. Let it build. And then

01:16:55.293 --> 01:17:03.168
when the time is right, you let her have it. And
I'll throw you into the fray, when the time is right.

01:17:03.168 --> 01:17:04.928
MARISHA: Promise?

01:17:04.928 --> 01:17:06.832
TRAVIS: Yeah, I promise.

01:17:06.832 --> 01:17:08.004
MARISHA: Deal.

01:17:08.004 --> 01:17:09.059
TRAVIS: Deal.

01:17:09.059 --> 01:17:10.233
(cracking noise)

01:17:10.233 --> 01:17:11.773
(laughter)

01:17:11.773 --> 01:17:12.750
MARISHA: Ow! Ow, Grog! Grog!

01:17:12.750 --> 01:17:13.885
TRAVIS: Oh shit, sorry! I'm so sorry!

01:17:13.885 --> 01:17:16.404
MARISHA: No, it's fine. I appreciate it. It's
good.

01:17:16.404 --> 01:17:18.155
TRAVIS: Oh, yeah. Bruises, right?

01:17:18.155 --> 01:17:20.105
LIAM: She should really take one hit point of
damage.

01:17:20.105 --> 01:17:21.771
(laughter)

01:17:21.771 --> 01:17:23.933
MATT: Sure, you take a hit point of damage.

01:17:23.933 --> 01:17:27.214
MARISHA: Oh man, people are going to ask
questions about that later.

01:17:27.214 --> 01:17:29.449
TRAVIS: No, it's cool. You make up a really good
story.

01:17:29.449 --> 01:17:31.809
MARISHA: Sure. Yeah.

01:17:31.809 --> 01:17:37.791
TRAVIS: But listen. If at any time it gets to be
too much, you just go. We've got you.

01:17:37.791 --> 01:17:41.275
MARISHA: Okay. I don't want to let you guys down.

01:17:41.275 --> 01:17:43.523
TRAVIS: You won't.

01:17:43.523 --> 01:17:48.898
MARISHA: Thanks, Grog. Okay. (clears throat) Let's
do this.

01:17:48.898 --> 01:17:53.815
MATT: All right. You guys enter the war room, same
as it was previously left. However, you are

01:17:53.815 --> 01:18:04.842
brought the image of the table in early morning:
Allura, Gilmore, surprisingly, Drake Thunderbrand,

01:18:04.842 --> 01:18:14.203
Cassandra, as well as Asum, who's standing behind
most of them, back to the window. They all, middle

01:18:14.203 --> 01:18:23.072
of conversation, turn, and smile as you begin to
walk in. You see Gilmore nods to everybody. Gives

01:18:23.072 --> 01:18:31.844
an extra smile to you, Vax. Cassandra's waiting
for the pleasantries to end. Allura comes up and

01:18:31.844 --> 01:18:41.395
takes your hand, and she goes, "It's wonderful to
see that you've returned safely. I've had many

01:18:41.395 --> 01:18:46.838
"terrible thoughts that perhaps this meeting would
not be as positive, and I'm very glad to know that

01:18:46.838 --> 01:18:54.782
"I was wrong. And that you brought Kima back to us
as well. Pike is safe as well. So congratulations,

01:18:54.782 --> 01:19:06.180
"I guess, are in order. Come, sit. These
circumstances do press our timeline a bit." And

01:19:06.180 --> 01:19:09.825
you see there are a number of other chairs already
brought into the room, prepared for you guys to

01:19:09.825 --> 01:19:11.122
sit around together.

01:19:11.122 --> 01:19:12.742
MARISHA: Is there anyone sitting next to Raishan?

01:19:12.742 --> 01:19:14.458
MATT: No, actually.

01:19:14.458 --> 01:19:16.086
MARISHA: I sit next to Raishan.

01:19:16.086 --> 01:19:19.331
MATT: Raishan is not sitting. Raishan is standing
with her arms crossed, leaning against the

01:19:19.331 --> 01:19:20.296
window.

01:19:20.296 --> 01:19:21.616
LAURA: I want to stay standing as well.

01:19:21.616 --> 01:19:23.743
MARISHA: Yeah, I move closer to Raishan.

01:19:23.743 --> 01:19:29.829
MATT: Okay. As you approach, you see Asum's eyes
watch you. Small grin on the face, and a little nod.

01:19:29.829 --> 01:19:31.298
MARISHA: I give a nod back.

01:19:31.298 --> 01:19:42.256
TALIESIN: I pull a chair out for Asum, and I'm
going to offer him the chair and sit. And pull one

01:19:42.256 --> 01:19:44.790
out extra for myself.

01:19:44.790 --> 01:19:53.976
MATT: At which point Cassandra gathers all of your
attention in the midst of this chaos. "The

01:19:53.976 --> 01:20:02.187
"excursion to Wildemount went well. As far as I
understand, you are now one more dragon-slaying

01:20:02.187 --> 01:20:11.068
"into this chaotic endeavor. Well done. Tell me,
how did this happen?"

01:20:11.068 --> 01:20:21.688
TALIESIN: A deal was made with the locals. We
brought the dragon to an appointed kill spot

01:20:21.688 --> 01:20:25.501
outside of the city. We summoned a creature.

01:20:25.501 --> 01:20:28.445
LAURA: With the Gate scroll that we showed you,
actually.

01:20:28.445 --> 01:20:38.321
TALIESIN: There was a battle. And we felled it.
That was more or less how it went down. It was a

01:20:38.321 --> 01:20:41.554
simple trap, it was elegant, and we barely
survived.

01:20:41.554 --> 01:20:50.306
MARISHA: I pull out the Spire of Conflux and hand
it to her. We retrieved this in our spoils. You

01:20:50.306 --> 01:20:52.811
may recognize it as one of the Vestiges that we
spoke of earlier.

01:20:52.811 --> 01:21:00.152
MATT: Cassandra takes it and says, "It looks quite
important. Allura."

01:21:00.152 --> 01:21:02.611
MARISHA: Yes, I thought I was handing it to
Allura.

01:21:02.611 --> 01:21:04.222
(laughter)

01:21:04.222 --> 01:21:06.510
MARISHA: Sorry. It was meant for Allura.

01:21:06.510 --> 01:21:08.760
MATT: I can see how this would be confusing.

01:21:08.760 --> 01:21:09.972
MARISHA: Yes.

01:21:09.972 --> 01:21:12.255
SAM: You look just like Allura right now.

01:21:12.255 --> 01:21:16.429
LAURA: Allura, is everything okay? Have you been
through some shit, Allura?

01:21:16.429 --> 01:21:17.801
MATT: "It's been a rough week."

01:21:17.801 --> 01:21:19.097
(laughter)

01:21:19.097 --> 01:21:22.111
MATT: I almost did Allura, too. Next Halloween.

01:21:22.111 --> 01:21:25.625
LIAM: Vax is leaning against the door to this
chamber, by the way.

01:21:25.625 --> 01:21:33.121
MATT: All right. Allura takes it, inspects it.
"This is a magnificent artifact. Well found.

01:21:33.121 --> 01:21:36.909
"Perhaps we'll take a look at it after the meeting
together."

01:21:36.909 --> 01:21:38.093
MARISHA: Sure.

01:21:38.093 --> 01:21:44.831
MATT: Cassandra gets everyone's attention once
more, motions to the guards. The door that you're

01:21:44.831 --> 01:21:51.565
leaning by gets closed as the guards step out, so
it's only you guys having this conversation. "So,

01:21:51.565 --> 01:21:59.232
"with another of the Conclave fallen, retaliation
is imminent. And with Thordak already infuriated

01:21:59.232 --> 01:22:06.720
"at the death of Umbrasyl, and we only caught but a
glance of that anger, thankfully through the means

01:22:06.720 --> 01:22:11.351
"of which Allura and Gilmore and others were able
to cloak the city, I do not feel that will last

01:22:11.351 --> 01:22:17.910
"the entirety of the time we would need to take a
leisurely stroll through our next series of plans.

01:22:17.910 --> 01:22:26.136
"I fear that less protected cities may be in the
path of retaliation before it finds its way to

01:22:26.136 --> 01:22:34.497
"us." Allura speaks up at this point and goes,
"Thordak is a creature of infinite pride. And a

01:22:34.497 --> 01:22:37.964
"slight such as this against the Conclave will most
likely trigger the destruction of even more

01:22:37.964 --> 01:22:47.456
"innocents. Both to satiate his anger and, I'm
certain, to also draw us out. He is an intelligent

01:22:47.456 --> 01:22:57.565
"one, as is the company he keeps. I've also reached
out to other members of the Arcana Pansophical,

01:22:57.565 --> 01:23:05.120
"and hope that they would come to our aid, but
given the recent death of Vorugal, I do not know

01:23:05.120 --> 01:23:10.751
"if they'll arrive in time to be of any assistance.
So we have to begin to gather our strengths, our

01:23:10.751 --> 01:23:16.524
"allies. And honestly, I think we need to strike
first."

01:23:16.524 --> 01:23:18.053
TRAVIS: You do?

01:23:18.053 --> 01:23:22.904
MATT: "Well, otherwise we wait for the fight to be
on Thordak's turf."

01:23:22.904 --> 01:23:26.815
TRAVIS: That's unexpected.

01:23:26.815 --> 01:23:29.202
LAURA: Just pop on over to Emon, then?

01:23:29.202 --> 01:23:35.104
MATT: "Well, we need a plan first. We need to
gather those we've called to arms. We need to

01:23:35.104 --> 01:23:41.771
"assess what strengths we have, and utilizing all
of these things at our disposal, come up with an

01:23:41.771 --> 01:23:48.420
"idea of how we're actually going to do this."
Gilmore steps in and goes, "If we are to strike, I

01:23:48.420 --> 01:23:54.332
"agree it should also be very soon. We've pushed
the boundaries of being on his peripheral even

01:23:54.332 --> 01:23:59.068
"this long. And you say that he knows your faces,
correct?"

01:23:59.068 --> 01:24:00.180
TALIESIN: Yes.

01:24:00.180 --> 01:24:07.155
MATT: "His gaze will now surely fall upon the
seven of you, at the very least."

01:24:07.155 --> 01:24:11.733
TALIESIN: It was inevitable.

01:24:11.733 --> 01:24:17.871
MATT: Asum steps forward at this point, from the
wall, and begins to walk in front of you, Keyleth,

01:24:17.871 --> 01:24:27.449
and between Percy, "The longer he remains as well,
the more the landscape of Emon and the surrounding

01:24:27.449 --> 01:24:39.401
"Bladeshimmer Shoreline begins to churn. Begins to
boil with flame and toxic fume. He is scarring the

01:24:39.401 --> 01:24:48.000
"surrounding land with his claws, his teeth, his
flames, his roar, and those that follow in his

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:57.524
"shadow. His fearmongering has risen a number under
him. A creature of such pride is eager to show that if

01:24:57.524 --> 01:25:05.804
"you fall in such fear and do as he says, there are
rewards. I'm sure you've come across many

01:25:05.804 --> 01:25:10.444
"weak-willed individuals in your travels that would
be eager to jump at the chance of working beneath

01:25:10.444 --> 01:25:13.521
"such a powerful and dangerous creature."

01:25:13.521 --> 01:25:23.937
Allura steps in at this point now and says, "Now I
believe it is partially his essence, but the

01:25:23.937 --> 01:25:32.854
"expedited rate of this elemental transition around
him is based on the soul anchor that we embedded

01:25:32.854 --> 01:25:40.834
"within him to keep him in the Fire Elemental
Plane. This stone that resides in the center of

01:25:40.834 --> 01:25:49.403
"his chest and belly. I believe this stone is
somehow drawing elements of the essence of the

01:25:49.403 --> 01:25:57.120
"Fire Elemental Plane itself into Emon. I mean,
it's not unusual for the presence of a red dragon

01:25:57.120 --> 01:26:06.208
"over hundreds of years to begin to convert the
scenery around, but this speed... I can only see a

01:26:06.208 --> 01:26:11.328
"connection between the enchantment that we hoped
would hold Thordak at bay, and the changes we're

01:26:11.328 --> 01:26:18.119
"seeing at the center of Emon and beyond. Now, it
was never intended for him to leave that place,

01:26:18.119 --> 01:26:25.990
"and I feel deeply responsible for many elements of
the danger we now see in this world. I only know

01:26:25.990 --> 01:26:31.199
"that I will do whatever it takes on my end to see
that this comes to an end. Whatever sacrifice,

01:26:31.199 --> 01:26:40.939
"whatever is necessary. I'm at your disposal. But
the responsibility of the destruction is also our

01:26:40.939 --> 01:26:50.946
"own. The longer we take, the more chance he will
tear through Kymal. He will tear through Westruun.

01:26:50.946 --> 01:27:01.337
"He will tear through Daxio. He will begin to burn
everything that Tal'Dorei is, until we show our faces."

01:27:01.337 --> 01:27:07.588
LIAM: I am curious what the Master of Secrets
thinks. Asum?

01:27:07.588 --> 01:27:11.296
MATT: Asum is still walking a circle around the
table.

01:27:11.296 --> 01:27:13.344
LIAM: What do you propose we do?

01:27:13.344 --> 01:27:25.994
MATT: "Hmph. Well, before we get to that, let us
discuss things we have at our disposal, the

01:27:25.994 --> 01:27:35.974
"information we have, and from that, we can garnish a
plan. I am the Master of Secrets; I am not a Master

01:27:35.974 --> 01:27:37.900
"of Warmongering and Attack."

01:27:37.900 --> 01:27:46.287
TALIESIN: I get up, I walk to the window, and I
look out the window. We're not going to be safe

01:27:46.287 --> 01:27:51.449
here for much longer, that much is certain. We
will need to move quickly.

01:27:51.449 --> 01:27:56.286
MATT: Drake speaks up for the first time and goes,
"Aye, not to mention that slippery green drake is

01:27:56.286 --> 01:27:59.398
"still out there somewhere, and we have no idea
where it is. Two members of the Conclave are

01:27:59.398 --> 01:28:00.871
"remaining."

01:28:00.871 --> 01:28:08.833
TRAVIS: Well-- Ow! Right, yeah. Two.

01:28:08.833 --> 01:28:20.561
TALIESIN: Do you think perhaps it's best to skip
one and hope for the element of surprise? Maybe he

01:28:20.561 --> 01:28:28.004
thinks we're going to finish off his generals
before we come to him. It may be a &lt;i&gt;brief&lt;/i&gt; moment

01:28:28.004 --> 01:28:34.400
of surprise. If anything, maybe he's expecting us
to kill one more, not go for the main prize.

01:28:34.400 --> 01:28:36.138
LIAM: Cut off the head of the king?

01:28:36.138 --> 01:28:37.245
TALIESIN: Maybe.

01:28:37.245 --> 01:28:46.116
SAM: Thordak, from what I understand, is extremely
powerful and influential. That Raishan dragon is a

01:28:46.116 --> 01:28:55.527
mere pittance in comparison. A small, exponential
ant, a pawn, if you will, on the battlefield.

01:28:55.527 --> 01:29:01.810
MATT: "I certainly hope so. And if that's the
case, then I think you're right. Go for the king

01:29:01.810 --> 01:29:06.983
"first. But we must do so with eyes all about us
because the last thing we need is to be flanked by

01:29:06.983 --> 01:29:08.974
"that beast in the center of our attack."

01:29:08.974 --> 01:29:11.783
MARISHA: Exactly. We don't want to deal with two
ancient dragons.

01:29:11.783 --> 01:29:15.408
TALIESIN: Can we lure it somewhere else, perhaps?

01:29:15.408 --> 01:29:25.224
MATT: "If we knew where it fucking was." Allura
speaks up at this point and goes, "Look. I know

01:29:25.224 --> 01:29:29.988
"that Thordak's hate for me still burns, hence the
reason why they went directly for my tower when

01:29:29.988 --> 01:29:36.123
"they first arrived in Emon. The one trump card we
do have in this is me."

01:29:36.123 --> 01:29:40.338
LAURA: Do you want to offer yourself as bait?

01:29:40.338 --> 01:29:45.152
MATT: "If need be. I'm not saying that's the right
plan, but I'm saying it is one thing we can

01:29:45.152 --> 01:29:48.309
"perhaps utilize in our plan, in our strategy."

01:29:48.309 --> 01:29:49.972
TRAVIS: Is his hate for you?

01:29:49.972 --> 01:30:01.324
TALIESIN: I think-- There was a
ship in Draconia, a northern ship of some kind. I

01:30:01.324 --> 01:30:08.574
still feel there may be some sort of weapon inside it
that may prove useful. It was a ship that had been

01:30:08.574 --> 01:30:15.138
dragged there by the white dragon. It's been
bothering me. And then of course we have whatever

01:30:15.138 --> 01:30:22.034
it is we have downstairs. I'm not saying we should
use it, but it is powerful.

01:30:22.034 --> 01:30:24.430
LAURA: I don't know how we would use it.

01:30:24.430 --> 01:30:25.690
TRAVIS: We can't move it, can we?

01:30:25.690 --> 01:30:27.272
LAURA: We can't touch it.

01:30:27.272 --> 01:30:34.493
MATT: Gilmore pops up again and says, "Exactly. We
were poring over that thing for a number of

01:30:34.493 --> 01:30:38.580
"weeks, until we had to build this barrier. And to
be perfectly honest, I am sick of it."

01:30:38.580 --> 01:30:39.990
LIAM: You've got nothing?

01:30:39.990 --> 01:30:45.918
MATT: "Well, we understand it's a siphon. It's
bringing the energy of the nexus somewhere. We

01:30:45.918 --> 01:30:49.933
"don't know where the other end of it is. Or if
it's even functioning properly."

01:30:49.933 --> 01:30:55.794
MARISHA: Allura, do you still feel a connection
with the soul stone that's inside of Thordak?

01:30:55.794 --> 01:31:01.107
MATT: "Well, I have no personal connection to it, I
know that I was the architect of its enchantment,

01:31:01.107 --> 01:31:05.179
"and the ruse, of which sealed it within Thordak."

01:31:05.179 --> 01:31:09.046
MARISHA: You built it. You must know of some way
to disable it.

01:31:09.046 --> 01:31:10.350
TRAVIS: Or a weakness.

01:31:10.350 --> 01:31:11.268
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:31:11.268 --> 01:31:29.602
MATT: "We designed it to have no weakness. The
intent was to keep him there indefinitely. Perhaps

01:31:29.602 --> 01:31:32.265
"if we could--"

01:31:32.265 --> 01:31:33.343
MARISHA: What?

01:31:33.343 --> 01:31:37.899
MATT: "Asum. You said you have friends, back in
Emon still, that have been gathering intel." Asum

01:31:37.899 --> 01:31:44.460
turns. "Yes, actually. And I was hoping that, as
part of our plan today, we could even go and

01:31:44.460 --> 01:31:50.107
"retrieve some of this information. Perhaps that
could teach us more about this soul anchor you

01:31:50.107 --> 01:31:51.759
"continuously talk about."

01:31:51.759 --> 01:31:54.378
SAM: How can we retrieve this information without
going to Emon?

01:31:54.378 --> 01:31:57.899
MATT: "Oh, we would have to go to Emon."

01:31:57.899 --> 01:32:04.407
SAM: That sounds crazy. Is there any way to not do
that?

01:32:04.407 --> 01:32:08.390
MATT: "Perhaps I'll go alone."

01:32:08.390 --> 01:32:16.776
MARISHA: The soul stone has been broken and abused
before. I have a feeling there's someone who might

01:32:16.776 --> 01:32:22.526
have an idea on how to disable it.

01:32:22.526 --> 01:32:26.564
TRAVIS: I really don't, I have no idea.

01:32:26.564 --> 01:32:31.384
MARISHA: Well, Raishan was the one who busted out
Thordak in the first place, out of the Fire Plane.

01:32:31.384 --> 01:32:35.656
So I would assume that Raishan has some idea on
how to--

01:32:35.656 --> 01:32:37.497
TRAVIS: Oh.

01:32:37.497 --> 01:32:43.112
LAURA: You think? I feel like Raishan would only
know how to open up a portal.

01:32:43.112 --> 01:32:47.487
MARISHA: Well, I have a lot of feelings about
Raishan.

01:32:47.487 --> 01:32:58.217
MATT: Cassandra speaks up and says, "Well, you've
been abroad. You've been gaining arms and allies,

01:32:58.217 --> 01:33:05.796
"from what you've told me from across Exandria. Let
us consolidate our options, our strengths, and

01:33:05.796 --> 01:33:09.434
"plop it down in front of the Conclave, best we
can."

01:33:09.434 --> 01:33:18.973
SAM: I'm no master strategist, but we do have
allies that we can call upon, and weapons, and men

01:33:18.973 --> 01:33:29.915
and arms and troops. However, taking the fight to
Thordak in Emon seems foolhardy at best. I suppose

01:33:29.915 --> 01:33:35.828
this is where the intelligence could come into
play. Is there some other place where we could go

01:33:35.828 --> 01:33:43.030
and try to take back from Thordak, to lure him
away from Emon?

01:33:43.030 --> 01:33:50.328
MATT: Asum steps into the conversation and goes,
"The thing with that plan is Thordak has amassed

01:33:50.328 --> 01:33:56.581
"thousands of lizardfolk in Emon at this point that
follow his whim. In the nearby mountain ranges,

01:33:56.581 --> 01:34:03.501
"many from the Stormcrest, that worshipped him the
entire time that he was gone. Wyvern riders

01:34:03.501 --> 01:34:11.451
"originally aided in taking the city that you met,
as did I. But since, other allies have found their

01:34:11.451 --> 01:34:21.348
"way to the Cinder King's sway. Last that I
checked, it seemed that there were a number of

01:34:21.348 --> 01:34:24.955
"allies that he brought over from his time in the
Fire Plane as well."

01:34:24.955 --> 01:34:26.804
LAURA: What?!

01:34:26.804 --> 01:34:29.662
MATT: "Fire giants, in the service of the dragon,
now walk the streets."

01:34:29.662 --> 01:34:38.888
SAM: So, if we go into Emon, we're facing fire
giants, lizard people, and that's before we get to

01:34:38.888 --> 01:34:40.364
Thordak the Cinder King?

01:34:40.364 --> 01:34:43.696
LAURA: How the fuck are we going to fight him?!

01:34:43.696 --> 01:34:47.324
MATT: "That's what we're discussing today."

01:34:47.324 --> 01:34:56.573
SAM: Does Thordak covet any other territory, or
city, or town? Vasselheim? Here? Anywhere that we

01:34:56.573 --> 01:34:57.935
can lure him to?

01:34:57.935 --> 01:35:01.523
TRAVIS: Anything he has nostalgic feelings about?
Glintshore--

01:35:01.523 --> 01:35:03.271
LIAM: Anything that would piss him off?

01:35:03.306 --> 01:35:09.007
MATT: "You were lucky to draw a creature of such
infinitesimal experience and intelligence as a

01:35:09.007 --> 01:35:16.138
"white dragon away from its home roost. I would be
greatly surprised if you had pulled a great,

01:35:16.138 --> 01:35:21.184
"powerful, intelligent, ancient red dragon from its
home turf advantage."

01:35:21.184 --> 01:35:26.734
LIAM: So your prediction is that we have to slog
our way through the outskirts of Emon to fight him

01:35:26.734 --> 01:35:29.984
on his home turf. Is that about the size of it?

01:35:29.984 --> 01:35:31.217
MATT: "That's one way."

01:35:31.217 --> 01:35:33.435
SAM: What's another?

01:35:33.435 --> 01:35:41.269
MATT: "Distract his allies and go straight for the
heart. You have allies, like Allura just said, all

01:35:41.269 --> 01:35:42.879
"throughout the world."

01:35:42.879 --> 01:35:47.665
TRAVIS: This is true. We have the Herd, we can
go get the werewolves.

01:35:47.665 --> 01:35:52.411
SAM: The Ravenites would help.

01:35:52.411 --> 01:35:56.445
MARISHA: Everyone who we ask, everyone who we send
in there, we're sending in to their death.

01:35:56.445 --> 01:35:58.681
TALIESIN: This is war.

01:35:58.681 --> 01:36:03.489
TRAVIS: Yeah, but it's either death now or death a
little later.

01:36:03.489 --> 01:36:05.334
LAURA: We're sending ourselves as well.

01:36:05.334 --> 01:36:10.212
LIAM: So, are we talking about sending everyone we
know and everything we have to the outskirts of town--

01:36:10.212 --> 01:36:14.314
SAM: For a full frontal attack. While we bamf into
the dragon's lair.

01:36:14.314 --> 01:36:21.271
LIAM: Yeah. We create a massive fucking
clusterfuck on the edge of his periphery and we go

01:36:21.271 --> 01:36:22.616
for the center.

01:36:22.616 --> 01:36:27.696
LAURA: How long did it take you, Allura, to create
that heart?

01:36:27.696 --> 01:36:36.079
MATT: "Well. The design and the development and
enchantment of it are powerful enough to anchor

01:36:36.079 --> 01:36:41.605
"itself to the soul of a dragon of Thordak's
strength. Better part of six months."

01:36:41.605 --> 01:36:43.773
LIAM and LAURA: Six months.

01:36:43.773 --> 01:36:45.315
LIAM: We've probably got a week or two.

01:36:45.315 --> 01:36:53.772
MATT: "And that was with a dozen other hands
helping me. Most of the Arcana Pansophical was at

01:36:53.772 --> 01:36:56.892
"my side for that and we don't have that kind of
time."

01:36:56.892 --> 01:37:03.789
LIAM: Well, we take a day or two and we amass every
heavy fucking hitter we have, and we do this. What

01:37:03.789 --> 01:37:05.883
other choice do we have?

01:37:05.883 --> 01:37:09.802
MARISHA: I keep thinking back to Emon where we
watched half of our friends die in a second.

01:37:09.802 --> 01:37:13.084
LIAM: A lot of us are going to die.

01:37:13.084 --> 01:37:20.342
MATT: Cassandra sits up a little bit in her seat
and goes, "If we are smart about this, we can

01:37:20.342 --> 01:37:25.901
"minimize the casualties far more now than they
would be a week, two weeks, a month, a year from now."

01:37:25.901 --> 01:37:27.461
TRAVIS: I agree.

01:37:27.461 --> 01:37:36.790
TALIESIN: What of Whitestone? We put the city at
great risk. How much risk are we willing to take?

01:37:36.790 --> 01:37:40.127
LIAM: Percy, everywhere is at great risk right
now.

01:37:40.127 --> 01:37:41.483
MARISHA: It's true.

01:37:41.483 --> 01:37:43.824
TRAVIS: We should leave Whitestone.

01:37:43.824 --> 01:37:54.476
SAM: But even getting to Emon, aren't we exposing
ourselves to detection and attack?

01:37:54.476 --> 01:37:56.015
TRAVIS: We are if we wait.

01:37:56.015 --> 01:38:00.120
SAM: We're going to march several armies across
the entire continent to get there? It'll take days.

01:38:00.120 --> 01:38:01.726
LAURA: How do we get armies there?

01:38:01.726 --> 01:38:04.971
LIAM: We're going to take a day or two. We're
going to figure out how to get who we have to

01:38:04.971 --> 01:38:10.529
where we need. We're not doing this tomorrow. In a
couple of days. Three days. Four days at the most.

01:38:10.529 --> 01:38:16.698
It's not ideal, but it's what we have to do.

01:38:16.698 --> 01:38:23.692
SAM: We can at least move people to, you know.
Where's that town that was established?

01:38:23.692 --> 01:38:26.400
TRAVIS: Outside of Westruun?

01:38:26.400 --> 01:38:28.973
MATT: There's Westruun, Kymal were the two that
you moved--

01:38:28.973 --> 01:38:31.133
SAM: Westruun is close-ish, right, to Emon?

01:38:31.133 --> 01:38:38.925
MATT: Westruun's a little bit further than Kymal
is. Kymal is where you sent a lot of the Westruun

01:38:38.925 --> 01:38:41.166
refugees.

01:38:41.166 --> 01:38:42.082
TRAVIS: Right.

01:38:42.082 --> 01:38:43.400
LAURA: But they're just townsfolk.

01:38:43.400 --> 01:38:51.435
SAM: But we can at least assemble there, from all
the different territories, and then meet up, form

01:38:51.435 --> 01:38:52.982
a plan, and then march from there.

01:38:52.982 --> 01:39:00.772
LAURA: March on Emon? If we gather our forces,
Thordak will notice.

01:39:00.772 --> 01:39:06.178
TRAVIS: Yeah, we've got to do a lot of recon
before then. But I think he's got a good point,

01:39:06.178 --> 01:39:07.981
right? We've got to have like a staging point.

01:39:07.981 --> 01:39:15.822
MATT: Cassandra turns, looks over to Asum and
goes, "Recon, actually. Anything else, Asum, you

01:39:15.822 --> 01:39:21.769
"may have in regards to what we can expect there?"
Asum is still slowly walking around the peripheral

01:39:21.769 --> 01:39:29.605
of the meeting table. "I can tell you that most of
the city's wealth and resources, as well as

01:39:29.605 --> 01:39:37.148
"caches, sealed arcane relics, and weaponry, long
held by the Lyceum or the arms of Emon, have been

01:39:37.148 --> 01:39:42.330
"stolen and thrown atop the victory hoard of
Thordak. Most who are part of this rebellion

01:39:42.330 --> 01:39:48.993
"within the city are doing so with scraps. That is
why the Clasp has been so instrumental in the

01:39:48.993 --> 01:39:59.124
"removal of many of the oppressed folk within the
city. Also, the fire that marks Thordak's presence

01:39:59.124 --> 01:40:04.776
"that have drawn fire and molten rock across the
city, as well as the outskirts of the city walls,

01:40:04.776 --> 01:40:12.813
"scar the landscape and fill the sky with sulfurous
clouds and black smoke. The good news is that

01:40:12.813 --> 01:40:20.387
"smoke can be utilized, should someone have some
control over the elements, to be a screen.

01:40:20.387 --> 01:40:28.647
"However, where the Cloudtop District once stood,
there is now but a heated cauldron of glowing

01:40:28.647 --> 01:40:35.012
"stone and flame. Hundreds of gifts and statues
left in Thordak's image litter the outer area,

01:40:35.012 --> 01:40:40.789
"while a massive cavern dives beneath the central
region of the district. Now this cavern, as we've

01:40:40.789 --> 01:40:45.670
"watched it, we believe it to be the location of
Thordak's treasure vault. As well as the

01:40:45.670 --> 01:40:52.592
"occasional sleeping place of the massive drake we
speak of. Thordak is also showing rather intense

01:40:52.592 --> 01:40:59.801
"signs of physical change since being released from
his prison. And his size still remains enormous by

01:40:59.801 --> 01:41:12.163
"comparison. His eyes now burn with a searing white
light. Burning stars in the sky. His jaw ever

01:41:12.163 --> 01:41:17.397
"dribbles with burning liquid that blackens the
ground it touches. The gaps between scales appear

01:41:17.397 --> 01:41:21.737
"to flare bright with each breath, like a star
engine beneath the scales."

01:41:21.737 --> 01:41:25.210
MARISHA: (sneezes) Sorry.

01:41:25.210 --> 01:41:26.405
LAURA: Bless you.

01:41:26.405 --> 01:41:28.177
MARISHA: Yeah. Sorry.

01:41:28.177 --> 01:41:30.284
LAURA: Do you think it's overtaking him?

01:41:30.284 --> 01:41:44.158
MATT: "I've no idea. Allura?" And Allura goes,
"Well, if the anchor was indeed removed from the

01:41:44.158 --> 01:41:52.779
"Fire Elemental Plane, then Thordak would have had
his soul torn from his body. That is how the

01:41:52.779 --> 01:41:54.931
"anchor worked."

01:41:54.931 --> 01:41:58.516
MARISHA: So you don't think he actually even fully
separated from the plane, he brought the plane

01:41:58.516 --> 01:42:00.093
with him.

01:42:00.093 --> 01:42:05.373
MATT: "Or at least, maybe a piece. I wasn't there,
I don't know the ritual that brought him over."

01:42:05.373 --> 01:42:09.929
MARISHA: Maybe then we're looking at this the
wrong way. Maybe we go at this through the Fire

01:42:09.929 --> 01:42:12.033
Plane. Maybe there's something still there.

01:42:12.033 --> 01:42:14.286
TALIESIN: A way to sever his connection to the
Fire Plane, maybe.

01:42:14.286 --> 01:42:15.864
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:42:15.864 --> 01:42:17.675
MATT: Allura thinks for a second.

01:42:17.675 --> 01:42:21.473
MARISHA: We've got an easy door in.

01:42:21.473 --> 01:42:31.316
MATT: "I could try. But the enchantment itself--
We don't have enough information. It wasn't bound

01:42:31.316 --> 01:42:36.982
"to a specific place in the plane, it was bound to
the plane itself. I don't know how you'd sever it

01:42:36.982 --> 01:42:39.192
"from the other side."

01:42:39.192 --> 01:42:44.161
TRAVIS: From the other side, we'd have to go
there.

01:42:44.161 --> 01:42:45.124
SAM: Yeah.

01:42:45.124 --> 01:42:46.955
TRAVIS: That's called thinking outside the
circle.

01:42:46.955 --> 01:42:49.220
SAM: But then once we're there, what do we do?

01:42:49.220 --> 01:42:54.242
MARISHA: And we don't even know where to look. I
mean, we could at least talk to the Ashari there.

01:42:54.242 --> 01:42:55.637
They might--

01:42:55.637 --> 01:42:56.848
TALIESIN: Another ally.

01:42:56.848 --> 01:42:59.908
TRAVIS: Is there like nothing friendly in the Fire
Plane?

01:42:59.908 --> 01:43:02.812
LIAM: It's at least as big as Tal'Dorei. I mean,
it's another dimension.

01:43:02.812 --> 01:43:03.956
LAURA: It's huge.

01:43:03.956 --> 01:43:07.698
MARISHA: It's huge, but not many people know the
whereabouts. There's still locations and

01:43:07.698 --> 01:43:12.317
destinations within the Fire Plane. It's
navigable.

01:43:12.317 --> 01:43:16.817
LAURA: Maybe all the evil things in the Fire Plane
are gone right now and they're with Thordak.

01:43:16.817 --> 01:43:22.845
MATT: Asum steps forward to the table, and puts
his little halfling hands on the edge and goes,

01:43:22.845 --> 01:43:29.615
"Well, it's a shame that we don't have any
information about this ritual that freed him from

01:43:29.615 --> 01:43:30.922
"the plane."

01:43:30.922 --> 01:43:36.004
LAURA: That is a shame. A real shame.

01:43:36.004 --> 01:43:42.888
MATT: "I'll see if my compatriots can gather
information, but in the meantime we'll do the best

01:43:42.888 --> 01:43:45.253
"we can to gather similar information."

01:43:45.253 --> 01:43:51.399
LIAM: Well, we know we don't have a lot of time,
but do we maybe want to table this and think on it?

01:43:51.399 --> 01:43:56.434
SAM: At the very least, should we send out some
letters, alerting our allies that--

01:43:56.434 --> 01:43:57.819
LAURA: Shit's going down.

01:43:57.819 --> 01:44:02.830
SAM: It's time to start stocking up and getting
ready to move?

01:44:02.830 --> 01:44:06.654
MATT: Drake steps forward and goes, "I think
that's a fine plan of action. Reach out to all

01:44:06.654 --> 01:44:10.388
"those you brought in. Hopefully we can get a few
of our friends in this as well."

01:44:10.388 --> 01:44:14.356
LAURA: Did an airship ever arrive?

01:44:14.356 --> 01:44:20.221
MATT: They all look at each other, a bit confused.
"No."

01:44:20.221 --> 01:44:23.264
LAURA: An airship? Did anyone see an airship
flying around?

01:44:23.264 --> 01:44:27.035
MATT: "I didn't see one." And Cassandra goes, "No.
There hasn't been an airship here, no. Are we

01:44:27.035 --> 01:44:28.238
"expecting one?"

01:44:28.238 --> 01:44:29.600
LAURA: Mm-hmm.

01:44:29.600 --> 01:44:30.747
MATT: "Good to know."

01:44:30.747 --> 01:44:32.527
SAM: The city is invisible.

01:44:32.527 --> 01:44:36.822
MATT: "Yes, so they won't see us if they come. If
we see an airship, do you wish us to flag it down?"

01:44:36.822 --> 01:44:37.851
LAURA: That would be good.

01:44:37.851 --> 01:44:38.842
MATT: "You trust it?"

01:44:38.842 --> 01:44:39.796
LAURA: Yes.

01:44:39.796 --> 01:44:41.227
LIAM: They are a rarity.

01:44:41.227 --> 01:44:42.588
MATT: "All right."

01:44:42.588 --> 01:44:45.384
SAM: Maybe come up with a landing point as well.

01:44:45.384 --> 01:44:47.753
MATT: "Now?"

01:44:47.753 --> 01:44:51.992
SAM: Well, soon.

01:44:51.992 --> 01:44:59.317
TALIESIN: We have one other possible option in
front of us. Show them the medal.

01:44:59.317 --> 01:45:02.800
SAM: No, thank you.

01:45:02.800 --> 01:45:07.189
TALIESIN: You're not going to show them the medal?
Not that, no! No, not that. Please don't whip that

01:45:07.189 --> 01:45:08.559
out, no one wants to see that.

01:45:08.559 --> 01:45:09.727
SAM: No, not the cube.

01:45:09.727 --> 01:45:13.836
TALIESIN: We have another ally that we have spoken
of.

01:45:13.836 --> 01:45:20.453
SAM: It's a tenuous ally at best. Maybe we
shouldn't discuss it until we're 100% sure about it.

01:45:20.453 --> 01:45:26.922
LIAM: Yeah, that's a big maybe. That's a big
maybe. Yeah.

01:45:26.922 --> 01:45:31.979
MARISHA: Yeah, they're very busy though.

01:45:31.979 --> 01:45:39.727
LAURA: Yeah, it's really far away and, then as we
were leaving, the people that we talked to about it--

01:45:39.727 --> 01:45:43.988
MATT: "It's fine, I get it! Reach out to your
people on one end."

01:45:43.988 --> 01:45:51.505
TALIESIN: I slowly walk around the table, thinking
hard about it.

01:45:51.505 --> 01:45:57.180
And I stab Seeker Asum three times
in the back with my sword.

01:45:57.180 --> 01:46:02.269
MARISHA: Let's fucking do this shit! Let's do it!
Let's do it!

01:46:02.269 --> 01:46:05.249
LAURA: But we need to know the ritual!

01:46:05.249 --> 01:46:07.089
LIAM: It's too late, he did it.

01:46:07.089 --> 01:46:08.768
MARISHA: (yelling) Yeah!

01:46:08.768 --> 01:46:10.276
SAM: Oh Percy, no.

01:46:10.276 --> 01:46:12.480
MATT: Go ahead and roll--

01:46:12.480 --> 01:46:14.242
TALIESIN: That's a surprise attack.

01:46:14.242 --> 01:46:15.403
MATT: I know it is.

01:46:15.403 --> 01:46:20.788
SAM: Oh god, why? We're in crazy costumes.

01:46:20.788 --> 01:46:22.126
LIAM: Check out the brain on Brad.

01:46:22.126 --> 01:46:26.592
LAURA: We've got Allura and Gilmore, and Drake.

01:46:26.592 --> 01:46:28.892
TALIESIN: We have a lot of people in the room.

01:46:28.892 --> 01:46:30.298
SAM: Oh god.

01:46:30.298 --> 01:46:36.116
MATT: Go ahead and roll. Roll the first attack.
With advantage.

01:46:36.116 --> 01:46:37.773
TRAVIS: We're in a room.

01:46:37.773 --> 01:46:40.485
LAURA: Whitestone's about to be destroyed.

01:46:40.485 --> 01:46:42.535
SAM: And Raishan's about to leave.

01:46:42.535 --> 01:46:44.631
LIAM: Oh man, he's not making you roll stealth,
motherfucker.

01:46:44.631 --> 01:46:46.143
LAURA: Why would he? He doesn't--

01:46:46.143 --> 01:46:48.867
LIAM: Because I would. And Hotis did on me.

01:46:48.867 --> 01:46:50.923
LAURA: That's different.

01:46:50.923 --> 01:46:52.185
LIAM: No it's not.

01:46:52.185 --> 01:46:55.840
TALIESIN: That's 29.

01:46:55.840 --> 01:47:07.492
MATT: Okay. As you pull the blade out of the hilt
to go ahead and begin to strike-- You're a quick

01:47:07.492 --> 01:47:18.195
individual. You're also in the presence of an
entity that does not trust anyone or anything. You

01:47:18.195 --> 01:47:28.794
take the blade and swing out in the direction of
Seeker Asum. And where your blade strikes, it

01:47:28.794 --> 01:47:34.905
shimmers through the image. There's a flash, and
Asum is suddenly four feet away from the position

01:47:34.905 --> 01:47:41.075
where Asum was standing. At which point, everyone
in the room stands up immediately and is like,

01:47:41.075 --> 01:47:46.495
"Whoa whoa!" Cassandra goes over and puts her hand
towards you, and Asum is taking a few steps back

01:47:46.495 --> 01:47:49.072
and is like (breathes heavily).

01:47:49.072 --> 01:47:59.994
TALIESIN: No tricks in here. No tricks in here, if
we're really going to do this.

01:47:59.994 --> 01:48:07.364
MATT: There's this moment of extreme quiet,
tension, as Allura's looking at you, looking at

01:48:07.364 --> 01:48:12.885
Asum, looking around. And there's like this slow,
connecting moment of realization throughout the

01:48:12.885 --> 01:48:15.523
room as everyone's eyes go wide.

01:48:15.523 --> 01:48:21.338
TALIESIN: If we're really going to do this, no
tricks in here.

01:48:21.338 --> 01:48:25.692
MATT: And with that, we're going to take a break.

01:48:25.692 --> 01:48:29.298
(screaming)

01:48:29.298 --> 01:48:30.558
MARISHA: Amazing!

01:48:30.558 --> 01:48:31.698
LAURA: Taliesin!

01:48:31.698 --> 01:48:37.484
TALIESIN: Don't trust a man who just kissed
somebody! That's a man who's saying fuck it.

01:48:37.484 --> 01:48:39.824
LIAM: Backpedal, backpedal, backpedal!

01:48:39.824 --> 01:48:41.976
MARISHA: I'm into it. I'm really into it.

01:48:41.976 --> 01:48:44.309
LIAM: Yes, we know, darling. We know.

01:48:44.309 --> 01:48:48.801
MATT: All righty. Well, we'll go ahead and take a
short break here, guys. We'll be back here in a

01:48:48.801 --> 01:48:53.620
few minutes. And we'll (Victor voice) see what
happens next! (normal voice) All right. See you

01:48:53.620 --> 01:48:55.223
guys here in a minute.

01:48:55.223 --> 02:07:57.508
[break]

02:07:57.508 --> 02:08:03.431
MATT: Welcome back, everyone, to Critical Role.
When we last left off, Clarota, over here-- Let us

02:08:03.431 --> 02:08:05.061
all marvel at that!

02:08:05.061 --> 02:08:06.649
(cheering)

02:08:06.649 --> 02:08:08.726
TALIESIN: It was me all along!

02:08:08.726 --> 02:08:12.440
LAURA: Oh god. Are you going to leave that on the
whole time?

02:08:12.440 --> 02:08:14.352
TALIESIN: Oh hell no! I can't see or hear a
thing.

02:08:14.352 --> 02:08:16.633
MARISHA: It was so short-lived.

02:08:16.633 --> 02:08:18.642
LIAM: Three seconds of costume, that's all you
get!

02:08:18.642 --> 02:08:21.211
(laughter)

02:08:21.211 --> 02:08:22.810
SAM: You can't put just this part on?

02:08:22.810 --> 02:08:24.090
TALIESIN: No, it's really uncomfortable!

02:08:24.090 --> 02:08:25.511
LAURA: Just the helmet?

02:08:25.511 --> 02:08:28.439
LIAM: Do the frigging helmet. I had my arm behind
my back for two hours!

02:08:28.439 --> 02:08:29.667
TALIESIN: Why would you do that?

02:08:29.667 --> 02:08:31.001
LIAM: Commitment!

02:08:31.001 --> 02:08:34.094
MARISHA: I have so many guns in my belt! No one
can even see them, and I'm still committed.

02:08:34.094 --> 02:08:35.979
SAM: I painted my entire body.

02:08:35.979 --> 02:08:38.438
TALIESIN: What is wrong with you people?

02:08:38.438 --> 02:08:40.017
LAURA: That's good. You're good now.

02:08:40.017 --> 02:08:46.414
TALIESIN: I can't really claim sanity. I just did
something mind-bendingly stupid.

02:08:46.414 --> 02:08:48.527
LIAM: You now look like one of your own bullets.

02:08:48.527 --> 02:08:50.814
(laughter)

02:08:50.814 --> 02:08:53.698
MATT: You have a very Merlin from Excalibur thing
going on there right now.

02:08:53.698 --> 02:08:57.193
TALIESIN: A dream to some, a nightmare to others.

02:08:57.193 --> 02:08:59.331
(laughter)

02:08:59.331 --> 02:09:03.039
TALIESIN: Oh, like lightning! Yes!

02:09:03.039 --> 02:09:08.855
MATT: We need more green lights in here to really
get the effect.

02:09:08.855 --> 02:09:10.803
TALIESIN: Go see Excalibur. Not right now, but
tomorrow.

02:09:10.803 --> 02:09:15.334
MATT: All right! So, bringing it back in. As your
blade swings through and passes through the form

02:09:15.334 --> 02:09:21.442
of Seeker Asum, it shimmers and then darts
backward into the corner of the room.

02:09:21.442 --> 02:09:27.494
TALIESIN: I immediately sheath and say: No more
tricks. If we're going to do this, we need

02:09:27.494 --> 02:09:29.525
everybody to know what's on the table.

02:09:29.525 --> 02:09:36.517
MATT: At which point, everyone who stood up and
held off at the chaos, you see all the faces going

02:09:36.517 --> 02:09:43.013
off in realization. Asum goes from a defensive
position and then stands up again. Crosses the arms.

02:09:43.013 --> 02:09:51.075
TALIESIN: We're either going to win, or we're not.
I was hoping you were going to take care of that.

02:09:51.075 --> 02:10:01.377
MATT: "We're working on that plan as we speak. But
pardon me if I take a few-- how do you say--

02:10:01.377 --> 02:10:11.231
"&lt;i&gt;careful&lt;/i&gt; backups in case one would take a blade
and stab at an ally, supposedly."

02:10:11.231 --> 02:10:16.660
TALIESIN: You know damn well that we're not
allies. You know damn well that this is a tenuous

02:10:16.660 --> 02:10:20.576
relationship. And you know that neither of us
trust the other.

02:10:20.576 --> 02:10:27.783
MATT: At which point, Allura puts her hand out and
goes, "I'm sorry. What the hell is going on here?!"

02:10:27.783 --> 02:10:37.451
TALIESIN: We'll get there. I would hope that you
wouldn't trust us, and I would hope that you

02:10:37.451 --> 02:10:43.010
understand that we don't trust you. But we need to
make a real plan now.

02:10:43.010 --> 02:10:56.752
MATT: As the tension slowly subsides, Gilmore puts
his finger up, "Pardon my momentary ignorance.

02:10:56.752 --> 02:11:00.298
"Would you like me to cleanse the room?"

02:11:00.298 --> 02:11:10.155
TALIESIN: I'm hoping for a conversation to start
that I promised I wouldn't start myself. I am

02:11:10.155 --> 02:11:13.247
trying to keep to the letter of my word.

02:11:13.247 --> 02:11:21.408
SAM: It might help if Gilmore were to make sure
everyone is on the up-and-up in this room.

02:11:21.408 --> 02:11:25.209
TALIESIN: Seeker Asum, do you have an opinion on
how you would like to proceed?

02:11:25.209 --> 02:11:36.481
MATT: Seeker Asum takes a few steps towards you.
Casually looks up to you and goes to pat you on

02:11:36.481 --> 02:11:43.172
the shoulder. His illusory hand passing through
your form. Goes, "I'm quite comfortable where I am

02:11:43.172 --> 02:11:45.888
"right now. Let us continue this conversation."

02:11:45.888 --> 02:11:54.534
TALIESIN: The floor is yours if you wish to tell
everyone what the real plan is.

02:11:54.534 --> 02:12:05.860
MATT: "Very well! Since my hand has been forced.
Hello. Seeker Asum is still back in Emon, dealing

02:12:05.860 --> 02:12:16.605
"with the difficulty of preparing the current
circumstance we're discussing. I am Raishan.

02:12:16.605 --> 02:12:25.737
"Member of the Conclave. Up until recently, tenuous
ally with Thordak the Cinder King, who is now

02:12:25.737 --> 02:12:38.843
"considered a mutual thorn in all of our sides.
I've made an agreement with your Vox Machina for

02:12:38.843 --> 02:12:48.399
"quite some time. Together, using our combined
strengths, we slew Vorugal, the Frigid Doom, over

02:12:48.399 --> 02:12:56.104
"in Wildemount. We've returned to reconvene. I've
provided nothing but honest, upfront, and

02:12:56.104 --> 02:12:59.514
"necessarily vital information to your victory."

02:12:59.514 --> 02:13:06.789
TALIESIN: I will confirm everything but "for quite
some time" to the room.

02:13:06.789 --> 02:13:11.454
LAURA: I've just been staring at Allura.

02:13:11.454 --> 02:13:19.470
MATT: Allura, you see her fingers are twitching
and her arms tense, and there's this very faint

02:13:19.470 --> 02:13:26.103
air that's blowing her hair ever so slightly,
where there's no wind in the air. She's on edge

02:13:26.103 --> 02:13:29.304
right now and is looking to you guys for guidance,
like "Are we doing this?"

02:13:29.304 --> 02:13:37.566
Cassandra stood up immediately. For the first time
in a long time, since Whitestone was reclaimed,

02:13:37.566 --> 02:13:44.049
Cassandra now resembles more her age than she ever
did. She has a look on her face like she's far out

02:13:44.049 --> 02:13:48.306
of her depth. Understanding the circumstance,
there's legitimate fear in her face, and she's

02:13:48.306 --> 02:13:53.828
looking at Percival with that look of, "What have
you done?"

02:13:53.828 --> 02:13:59.205
TALIESIN: Now we can have a real conversation
about what's going on. We have an ally on the

02:13:59.205 --> 02:14:07.401
inside, albeit an untrustworthy one. You'll pardon
that, but there's every possibility that this is

02:14:07.401 --> 02:14:17.997
an elaborate trap. I respect your intelligence far
too much to try and pretend otherwise. You

02:14:17.997 --> 02:14:25.021
understand certainly what I mean? Having this on
the table, we now know that there's every

02:14:25.021 --> 02:14:31.666
possibility that the red dragon knows everything.
There's every possibility that we're walking into

02:14:31.666 --> 02:14:41.024
a trap. Or there's every possibility that we have
an insatiably powerful ally. It is a terrible risk.

02:14:41.024 --> 02:14:43.482
MARISHA: Or an insatiably powerful enemy.

02:14:43.482 --> 02:14:46.452
TALIESIN: Also a terrible risk.

02:14:46.452 --> 02:14:52.191
LAURA: Either way, we can now ask about the
ritual.

02:14:52.191 --> 02:15:02.894
MARISHA: Why don't you inform the room on how you
utilized an entire race of people to break the ritual?

02:15:02.894 --> 02:15:11.608
MATT: Everyone's still standing at this point,
looking. Cassandra slowly sits down but is still

02:15:11.608 --> 02:15:22.675
looking between Raishan and Percival. You watch as
Asum's form steps towards the center of the room,

02:15:22.675 --> 02:15:37.527
the flash of green flaring in the eyes with a
smile, "The anchor that you speak of was indeed

02:15:37.527 --> 02:15:46.979
"removed from the Fire Elemental Plane. We
discovered that it was indestructible. Good on

02:15:46.979 --> 02:15:55.017
"you, Allura. Well created. We tried many different
ways: rending it, crushing it, sending it

02:15:55.017 --> 02:16:05.102
"elsewhere without the enchantment tearing Thordak
with it. To no avail. In trying to find a way to

02:16:05.102 --> 02:16:14.409
"bring Thordak through, we needed to bring the soul
anchor and the Fire Elemental Plane with it. The

02:16:14.409 --> 02:16:25.912
"one place where such research could be gathered
promptly, fully, was Pyrah. Now, mind you, it was

02:16:25.912 --> 02:16:31.375
"not my intent for such destruction to rain upon
them. I spent many years with them. I got to know

02:16:31.375 --> 02:16:40.427
"them. They're a fine people. In that time, I
learned the ways of temporal travel between

02:16:40.427 --> 02:16:47.607
"dimensions. The details that allowed me to see the
fabric of the Fire Plane, to where we could encase

02:16:47.607 --> 02:16:57.255
"a bit of it within the soul anchor itself. Once we
had managed to crack that essence, I was able to,

02:16:57.255 --> 02:17:04.648
"from a distance, using the allies at the other
end-- Thordak had found friendship with some of the

02:17:04.648 --> 02:17:10.571
"ousted fire giants. They found comfort outside of
the ordning under the shadow of the fire dragon.

02:17:10.571 --> 02:17:18.400
"In using their deep, rich-blooded past and forging
and making, they were able to convert the soul

02:17:18.400 --> 02:17:27.247
"anchor into something that housed the essence of
the Fire Plane. However, we didn't have a means of

02:17:27.247 --> 02:17:34.164
"creating a hole large enough to bring both through
without destroying both in the process. And as

02:17:34.164 --> 02:17:39.847
"such, we waited for the right time: The Winter's
Crest."

02:17:39.847 --> 02:17:42.912
MARISHA: You bitch.

02:17:42.912 --> 02:17:55.726
MATT: "To some, maybe. But we called this the
Ember Seed. The Ember Seed resides in the center

02:17:55.726 --> 02:18:02.228
"of this heartstone. That is what is causing
Thordak to swell. That is what's driving him mad.

02:18:02.228 --> 02:18:12.168
"That is what is drawing the very land around Emon
to fiery eruption. It is also what keeps his soul

02:18:12.168 --> 02:18:13.501
"on this plane."

02:18:13.501 --> 02:18:17.359
TRAVIS: What keeps his soul on &lt;i&gt;this&lt;/i&gt; plane?

02:18:17.359 --> 02:18:19.738
MATT: "It keeps the soul intact with his body."

02:18:19.738 --> 02:18:22.026
TRAVIS: Destroy the stone...

02:18:22.026 --> 02:18:25.444
TALIESIN: It can't be destroyed.

02:18:25.444 --> 02:18:28.376
MATT: "In theory. But we've tried. Believe me;
we've tried."

02:18:28.376 --> 02:18:34.384
MARISHA: And you kept the soul and the stone
inside of him?

02:18:34.384 --> 02:18:45.509
MATT: "To remove it would destroy him as well, as
the Arcana Pansophical saw fit. So yes, both came

02:18:45.509 --> 02:18:52.127
"through. Waited for the Winter's Crest, had enough
power and understanding of the ritual to open the

02:18:52.127 --> 02:18:58.882
"entirety of the tear, and Thordak screamed
through, flames in his wake. And &lt;i&gt;he&lt;/i&gt; laid waste

02:18:58.882 --> 02:19:00.808
"to your people, not I."

02:19:00.808 --> 02:19:14.102
MARISHA: No. You used me. You used us. And my fear
that I had originally appears to be true. A lot of

02:19:14.102 --> 02:19:28.195
this is my fault. I'm willing to accept my onus.
The fact that you can't shows all the kind of

02:19:28.195 --> 02:19:40.649
person that you are. My promise still stands. I'm
thinking it might come sooner rather than later.

02:19:40.649 --> 02:19:55.336
MATT: "You do understand that without my aid, you
will not succeed?"

02:19:55.336 --> 02:20:02.973
MARISHA: I understand that without your aid, none
of this would have fucking happened in the first place.

02:20:02.973 --> 02:20:07.603
MATT: "Yes, and there are quite a few in this room
that fall in that category." She looks to Allura

02:20:07.603 --> 02:20:09.230
and Drake.

02:20:09.230 --> 02:20:16.618
MARISHA: So it seems all of us can accept our part
in this matter, except for you.

02:20:16.618 --> 02:20:23.755
MATT: "I accept my part in this matter as well.
You don't think I feel duped by this? You don't

02:20:23.755 --> 02:20:33.285
"think I have many things I wish to tear from the
very corpse of that entity? You think I don't want

02:20:33.285 --> 02:20:37.997
"to see him burn as much as you do? This vengeance
that burns within me!"

02:20:37.997 --> 02:20:44.512
MARISHA: What would you do if you actually got
what you want?

02:20:44.512 --> 02:20:50.984
MATT: "What all of us want: freedom."

02:20:50.984 --> 02:21:03.739
MARISHA: I pull out the Spire of Conflux. There
are always many solutions to many problems. You

02:21:03.739 --> 02:21:15.524
think Thordak is the only solution to yours? This
staff was birthed from the head of Melora, the

02:21:15.524 --> 02:21:30.405
same goddess who gave you that curse. What if you
wanted me instead? Me and this staff. Maybe I can

02:21:30.405 --> 02:21:32.868
help you more than Thordak can.

02:21:32.868 --> 02:21:40.203
MATT: "Are you saying you understand the way to
remove this? That you know the secret to burning

02:21:40.203 --> 02:21:44.622
"this wretched disease from my form?"

02:21:44.622 --> 02:21:51.483
MARISHA: I'm saying &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt; might be your best chance
at salvation. I'm pretty sure this staff is the

02:21:51.483 --> 02:22:01.160
closest living relic that we have in existence to
the god who granted your curse. Thordak is no god.

02:22:01.160 --> 02:22:04.099
That was your first &lt;i&gt;stupid&lt;/i&gt; mistake.

02:22:04.099 --> 02:22:25.949
TALIESIN: I think if I might translate. What my
friend here is trying to relate is that, perhaps

02:22:25.949 --> 02:22:34.237
when the dust has settled, your salvation may
either be found in the withering corpse or

02:22:34.237 --> 02:22:41.601
cackling smile of a creature that you are
subservient to, who will take great delight in

02:22:41.601 --> 02:22:49.288
your destruction. Or perhaps in those you've aided
who will feel grateful.

02:22:49.288 --> 02:22:52.291
MARISHA: It's up to you, Raishan.

02:22:52.291 --> 02:22:59.615
TALIESIN: And I will advise her to take no revenge
until all cards are on the table.

02:22:59.615 --> 02:23:02.589
MATT: "Well. Good."

02:23:02.589 --> 02:23:12.960
MARISHA: Clearly you are the type of person who
looks for answers in other people. You are clearly

02:23:12.960 --> 02:23:21.503
unaware of accepting any fault or any result of
your actions. Why don't you start fresh? Do you

02:23:21.503 --> 02:23:29.801
really want Thordak to have another sway over you?
Another gift, another favor, that he's given you?

02:23:29.801 --> 02:23:37.014
That he is going to hold over you for all of
eternity? Do you really want that? You're stronger

02:23:37.014 --> 02:23:38.645
than that.

02:23:38.645 --> 02:23:42.142
MATT: "That's why we're working to watch him
fall."

02:23:42.142 --> 02:23:43.827
MARISHA: Are we?

02:23:43.827 --> 02:23:49.152
MATT: (chuckles) "If you need not my help, just
let me know."

02:23:49.152 --> 02:24:00.057
MARISHA: Oh no, Raishan. We don't need your help.
Let me say that right now. This all depends on

02:24:00.057 --> 02:24:03.150
what you want out of the end of the deal.

02:24:03.150 --> 02:24:19.765
MATT: "I wish to be given unfettered, unbothered,
unwatched control over the corpse upon his death

02:24:19.765 --> 02:24:33.204
"to extract the information I need. I will leave
your very sphere of existence and understanding

02:24:33.204 --> 02:24:35.267
"until the end of your days."

02:24:35.267 --> 02:24:37.225
LIAM: What happens if we say no to that?

02:24:37.225 --> 02:24:39.528
MATT: "Oh, then I'll find another way."

02:24:39.528 --> 02:24:41.451
MARISHA: Spoiler alert: we're saying no to that.

02:24:41.451 --> 02:24:45.783
TALIESIN: Unfettered I'm fine with. It's
unwatched--

02:24:45.783 --> 02:24:51.840
MATT: "Then watch! Watch, for all I care. It will
be Greek to you anyway."

02:24:51.840 --> 02:24:57.497
MARISHA: She's taken way too much. She doesn't get
to leave!

02:24:57.497 --> 02:25:00.067
TALIESIN: She's already left.

02:25:00.067 --> 02:25:06.972
TRAVIS: Yeah, I walk over around the table towards
Asum. I try and poke her in the shoulder. Him.

02:25:06.972 --> 02:25:09.259
MATT: It passes through the form.

02:25:09.259 --> 02:25:15.128
TALIESIN: This is the deal that we are offered.
This is the deal that's on the table. We are in a

02:25:15.128 --> 02:25:17.000
tenuous position of power.

02:25:17.000 --> 02:25:19.088
SAM: You can stop poking, Grog.

02:25:19.088 --> 02:25:21.435
TRAVIS: She's not here!

02:25:21.435 --> 02:25:23.774
LAURA: That's crazy.

02:25:23.774 --> 02:25:25.616
SAM: Give her one more good poke.

02:25:25.616 --> 02:25:31.940
TALIESIN: How do we get in contact with you when
we know when we move and how?

02:25:31.940 --> 02:25:41.032
MATT: "Well, what is your next step through your
journey?"

02:25:41.032 --> 02:25:49.869
TALIESIN: That is the question. Now that
everything's on the table, I'm sorry to shock

02:25:49.869 --> 02:25:58.787
everyone. I was hoping not to be the cause of it.
I was hoping that it was time for everything to be

02:25:58.787 --> 02:26:06.495
on the table. But this is actually what we're
dealing with. This is the complexity. This is the

02:26:06.495 --> 02:26:08.402
battlefield.

02:26:08.402 --> 02:26:13.950
TRAVIS: So we have to rally our forces to us, and
we have to do some really smart recon. Do we make

02:26:13.950 --> 02:26:15.290
her a part of that or no?

02:26:15.290 --> 02:26:21.512
TALIESIN: No, the more distance that we keep, the
better.

02:26:21.512 --> 02:26:24.288
SAM: From her?

02:26:24.288 --> 02:26:34.816
TALIESIN: Yes. She will probably be, I imagine, in
our way on occasion.

02:26:34.816 --> 02:26:39.622
LIAM: But no one make any mistake. She's lying to
our faces. She is not telling us what she wants or

02:26:39.622 --> 02:26:42.675
what she wants to do. You have a whole plan!

02:26:42.675 --> 02:26:44.121
MATT: "Assume what you will."

02:26:44.121 --> 02:26:50.343
LIAM: Shut the fuck up! You've been droning on for
an hour! Shut the fuck up. You're not telling us

02:26:50.343 --> 02:26:54.814
what you want. You fucking shit bag. Fuck you!

02:26:54.814 --> 02:26:57.636
MATT: "Keep great company."

02:26:57.636 --> 02:27:03.124
LIAM: Does anyone really believe that this is all
going to be fixed if we work with her?

02:27:03.124 --> 02:27:13.288
MARISHA: I say we take a recess. Gather our
thoughts. Raishan, my offer still stands. If you

02:27:13.288 --> 02:27:20.665
want to come and find me, I know you know how.
Maybe we can commune with Melora together.

02:27:20.665 --> 02:27:34.181
MATT: "You do not comprehend the magics that you
even speak of. It's cute. Look, I agree. Distance

02:27:34.181 --> 02:27:40.950
"is of aid to us at the moment. If anything, I
should probably cut off the information of

02:27:40.950 --> 02:27:47.671
"Vorugal's fall. I should speak with the Cinder
King and still establish my allegiance from his

02:27:47.671 --> 02:27:49.712
"perspective."

02:27:49.712 --> 02:27:55.130
TALIESIN: Can you cut off that information? I
would imagine that would be far too much.

02:27:55.130 --> 02:28:03.827
MATT: "Cut it off, no. But I can attempt to guide
the fury, if you will."

02:28:03.827 --> 02:28:07.072
LAURA: Will he know it was us?

02:28:07.072 --> 02:28:09.462
MATT: "I can guarantee it."

02:28:09.462 --> 02:28:12.327
TRAVIS: Can you keep him from attacking
Whitestone?

02:28:12.327 --> 02:28:15.293
MATT: "For a time, maybe."

02:28:15.293 --> 02:28:20.392
MARISHA: Can you guide his fury in a way that
would be beneficial to the plan?

02:28:20.392 --> 02:28:23.249
MATT: "If I knew what the plan was, yes."

02:28:23.249 --> 02:28:27.867
MARISHA: You were saying ideally, if we could get
him away?

02:28:27.867 --> 02:28:30.420
TALIESIN: I don't think we're going to get him
away--

02:28:30.420 --> 02:28:36.272
SAM: We're going to do recon. We're going to send
out word to gather our forces-- where?

02:28:36.272 --> 02:28:37.921
TALIESIN: What if he knew where we were?

02:28:37.921 --> 02:28:39.340
TRAVIS: We don't know yet.

02:28:39.340 --> 02:28:41.018
SAM: Let's find out, let's pick a place.

02:28:41.018 --> 02:28:54.450
TALIESIN: What if you knew where we were? What if
we found a place? We pick our battleground. He

02:28:54.450 --> 02:28:55.994
discovers where we're hiding.

02:28:55.994 --> 02:28:57.472
MARISHA: And Raishan rats us out.

02:28:57.472 --> 02:29:00.151
TALIESIN: And Raishan discovers this information.

02:29:00.151 --> 02:29:04.133
MARISHA: Would certainly put you in the good
graces of the Cinder King.

02:29:04.133 --> 02:29:07.096
MATT: Raishan takes a moment and thinks.

02:29:07.096 --> 02:29:10.879
TALIESIN: You are searching for us right now, are
you not?

02:29:10.879 --> 02:29:15.507
MATT: "I am indeed, but Thordak has been using us
as the attack."

02:29:15.507 --> 02:29:17.503
LIAM: Yeah, he's not going to leave his nest.

02:29:17.503 --> 02:29:19.232
LAURA: So what if we kill you?

02:29:19.232 --> 02:29:24.601
MATT: "What do you mean?"

02:29:24.601 --> 02:29:28.213
LAURA: How does Thordak know you're alive?

02:29:28.213 --> 02:29:31.239
MATT: "Because I check in every now and then to
remind him."

02:29:31.239 --> 02:29:34.654
LAURA: What if he sends you out, and we kill you?

02:29:34.654 --> 02:29:39.525
MARISHA: And you never come back? He'd be forced
to be the one to have to leave the battlefield.

02:29:39.525 --> 02:29:41.828
TALIESIN: If he knew where you were headed.

02:29:41.828 --> 02:29:50.949
MARISHA: You're a clever girl. I'm sure you can
make a ruse to make you look convincingly dead.

02:29:50.949 --> 02:29:56.783
TALIESIN: You wouldn't even have to tell us where
you were hiding. You could just hide. And we could

02:29:56.783 --> 02:30:00.092
ready ourselves.

02:30:00.092 --> 02:30:15.198
MATT: "That is an idea. Hmm. Take your recess.
I'll take mine. There may be something to this plot."

02:30:15.198 --> 02:30:23.387
MARISHA: And we can all assume that when we exit
this room, that our tenuous alliance is still

02:30:23.387 --> 02:30:24.598
that. Correct?

02:30:24.598 --> 02:30:30.858
MATT: "I would hope that there's no more errant
blade pokery?"

02:30:30.858 --> 02:30:33.359
TALIESIN: Now that I know your tricks.

02:30:33.359 --> 02:30:36.049
LAURA: We do it to everyone. Don't worry.

02:30:36.049 --> 02:30:37.731
TALIESIN: We actually do, now that I think about
it.

02:30:37.731 --> 02:30:38.999
MARISHA: Yeah, that's kind of true.

02:30:38.999 --> 02:30:43.506
LIAM: We're also not alone here. Allura, how does
this sit with you?

02:30:43.506 --> 02:30:47.853
MATT: Allura is sitting right now, she's listening
to everything with her hands crossed. Shakes her

02:30:47.853 --> 02:31:00.186
head and goes, "To be perfectly honest, this
bothers me a great deal. But the fact that

02:31:00.186 --> 02:31:02.963
"Whitestone still stands does speak volumes at the
least."

02:31:02.963 --> 02:31:04.165
TALIESIN: It does.

02:31:04.165 --> 02:31:08.038
MATT: "With the cards being in our favor."

02:31:08.038 --> 02:31:11.531
TALIESIN: It's not the first devil I've made a
deal with.

02:31:11.531 --> 02:31:12.931
MATT: "No."

02:31:12.931 --> 02:31:15.306
LAURA: Doesn't always turn out well, Percival.

02:31:15.306 --> 02:31:17.518
TALIESIN: Doesn't always turn out terribly,
either.

02:31:17.518 --> 02:31:27.755
MATT: "Regardless, I have a lot to think about. As
do we all." And Allura slowly turns her head and

02:31:27.755 --> 02:31:34.730
looks up, probably for the first time since she
sat down, to the illusory Raishan's Asum form.

02:31:34.730 --> 02:31:52.649
"Asum lives, then?" "Indeed
he does. Indeed he does." And Allura turns her

02:31:52.649 --> 02:31:53.977
head back and goes--

02:31:53.977 --> 02:31:55.045
MARISHA: Can I do an insight check?

02:31:55.045 --> 02:31:56.968
MATT: Go for it.

02:31:56.968 --> 02:32:05.877
MARISHA: Does she know if Asum is up to something
no good? 25, I think? Better double check that. 25.

02:32:05.877 --> 02:32:15.702
MATT: 25? Okay. It's hard to read the demeanor of
Raishan in general. It's this middle ground of

02:32:15.702 --> 02:32:22.925
neutral expression with a half-cocked grin.
Information flows at this consistent rate of being

02:32:22.925 --> 02:32:34.247
generally difficult to read. The beat of
hesitation is meant for emphasis, more than

02:32:34.247 --> 02:32:43.197
covering, if that makes any sense. So it seems to
have an honesty to it, if you could read any

02:32:43.197 --> 02:32:45.173
honesty from Raishan.

02:32:45.173 --> 02:32:52.208
LAURA: Raishan, now that we know you're you, do
you have to continue the ruse of being Asum, or

02:32:52.208 --> 02:32:54.508
can you bring him here?

02:32:54.508 --> 02:33:00.857
MATT: "I can certainly bring him here if you'd
like. However, he is doing quite a lot of good

02:33:00.857 --> 02:33:06.920
"with the Clasp, and Brom and Tofor
underneath Emon right now, and they've managed to

02:33:06.920 --> 02:33:10.538
"save many lives and continue to do so."

02:33:10.538 --> 02:33:13.724
LAURA: Maybe you could pop him over then? Just for
a little bit.

02:33:13.724 --> 02:33:15.895
MATT: "Well--"

02:33:15.895 --> 02:33:18.970
LAURA: You're quite powerful.

02:33:18.970 --> 02:33:23.708
MATT: "What do you have need for Asum?"

02:33:23.708 --> 02:33:29.623
LAURA: I want to hear what's going on with the
Clasp. I want to see for myself that he's alive.

02:33:29.623 --> 02:33:33.025
TALIESIN: We're actually going to have to have a
conversation with the Clasp, because we're going

02:33:33.025 --> 02:33:37.400
to purge the city once the dragon is gone.

02:33:37.400 --> 02:33:38.977
MATT: "Why don't you go see him yourself?"

02:33:38.977 --> 02:33:42.934
TRAVIS: No, I like her idea. I want to see him
here.

02:33:42.934 --> 02:33:45.958
LIAM: Yeah. I feel a little better here. It would
go a long way to earning some trust.

02:33:45.958 --> 02:33:52.178
MATT: "Well, make your choice. Either I intercept
and begin to work towards Thordak's ruse and set

02:33:52.178 --> 02:34:00.944
"a space that convinces him perhaps I've fallen
into your hands, or I go retrieve your friend from

02:34:00.944 --> 02:34:05.740
"Emon. I'm not your errand boy, and we have a
limited time here. Which is more important?"

02:34:05.740 --> 02:34:11.417
TRAVIS: Sure you are. You are our errand boy. We
are your vessel to what it is you want. So get

02:34:11.417 --> 02:34:17.870
busy, and do it quickly. After all, you're very
powerful. But that changes day by day, doesn't it?

02:34:17.870 --> 02:34:28.183
MATT: "So, Emon it is. Very well. Back in a day."

02:34:28.183 --> 02:34:35.470
TALIESIN: We will start figuring out and
discussing a place for the final battle. We will

02:34:35.470 --> 02:34:43.944
find a place that is advantageous. Your input, if
you feel the urge to give it, is always welcome.

02:34:43.944 --> 02:34:47.583
At least to me.

02:34:47.583 --> 02:34:56.383
MATT: "It's going to be very difficult to pry the
Cinder King from his nest."

02:34:56.383 --> 02:35:00.335
TALIESIN: Your supposed death will go far for
that.

02:35:00.335 --> 02:35:03.616
MATT: "If anything, but I have no guarantees."

02:35:03.616 --> 02:35:14.610
TALIESIN: As long as everything is on the up and
up, and as long as we do not catch you in deep

02:35:14.610 --> 02:35:15.687
deceit.

02:35:15.687 --> 02:35:18.256
LIAM: (whispers) Good luck with that.

02:35:18.256 --> 02:35:26.523
TALIESIN: We will make sure that the plan moves in
the direction it is meant to.

02:35:26.523 --> 02:35:30.636
MATT: "One day then."

02:35:30.636 --> 02:35:32.672
TRAVIS: One day.

02:35:32.672 --> 02:35:34.390
MATT: And the image (disappearing noise).

02:35:34.390 --> 02:35:35.911
TALIESIN: He's going to send Asum to us.

02:35:35.911 --> 02:35:45.259
TRAVIS: So Allura, so it's clear: Seeker Asum is
Raishan.

02:35:45.259 --> 02:35:51.600
TALIESIN: And has been since Raishan's appearance
in Whitestone.

02:35:51.600 --> 02:35:56.205
MARISHA: And we didn't know until 48 hours ago?
Tops?

02:35:56.205 --> 02:35:59.888
TALIESIN: Now, can we maybe make sure that
everybody in the room is who they say they are?

02:35:59.888 --> 02:36:03.776
SAM: Go stab everyone, Percy. One at a time.

02:36:03.776 --> 02:36:07.831
MATT: As you say that, everyone pulls back from
the table.

02:36:07.831 --> 02:36:13.027
LAURA: I'm a dragon too! (evil laugh)

02:36:13.027 --> 02:36:15.325
LIAM: Hi. Larkin.

02:36:15.325 --> 02:36:17.622
MATT: There he is!

02:36:17.622 --> 02:36:21.586
TALIESIN: I apologize. I didn't know what else to
do.

02:36:21.586 --> 02:36:23.649
LAURA: You thought you were going to stab him!

02:36:23.649 --> 02:36:25.652
LIAM: Yes you did, Percival.

02:36:25.652 --> 02:36:26.958
LAURA: That was not a play!

02:36:26.958 --> 02:36:31.392
TRAVIS: Yeah, let's be real about it. "No tricks
in this room!"

02:36:31.392 --> 02:36:32.911
LIAM: Yeah, you shifted gears very quickly there.

02:36:32.911 --> 02:36:34.035
LAURA: No tricks.

02:36:34.035 --> 02:36:35.400
TALIESIN: I've told no lies in this room.

02:36:35.400 --> 02:36:36.469
LIAM: Uh-huh.

02:36:36.469 --> 02:36:38.593
TRAVIS: (fake cough) Whiff!

02:36:38.593 --> 02:36:52.421
TALIESIN: I tell that creature no lies. Ever. That
is a green dragon. There is no tricking it, there

02:36:52.421 --> 02:36:56.651
is no deceiving it. There is just telling as much
truth as you can get away with.

02:36:56.651 --> 02:37:02.627
MATT: As you're talking, you feel a tug on your
right arm. And you look over and you see

02:37:02.627 --> 02:37:07.271
Cassandra, who has come over to your side and is
pulling on your sleeve with a very intense look in

02:37:07.271 --> 02:37:21.094
her eye. She goes, "Percival. I can watch
Whitestone. I can get the people fed. I can keep

02:37:21.094 --> 02:37:31.524
"the people armed. I can organize the day to day. I
can't keep it safe from that."

02:37:31.524 --> 02:37:34.517
TALIESIN: Which is why I would ask everyone to
please not antagonize it.

02:37:34.517 --> 02:37:41.729
MATT: "Percival. Percival! I don't know what you
dragged us into in this, but I need you to pull us

02:37:41.729 --> 02:37:46.389
"out of it. I can't do this."

02:37:46.389 --> 02:37:52.339
TALIESIN: I've moved the battle. That is the best
that I know how.

02:37:52.339 --> 02:37:54.296
MATT: "How long have you known?"

02:37:54.296 --> 02:37:55.882
TALIESIN: Two days.

02:37:55.882 --> 02:37:57.324
LAURA: Not long, Cassandra.

02:37:57.324 --> 02:37:58.507
TALIESIN: Two days.

02:37:58.507 --> 02:37:59.859
SAM: Maybe three.

02:37:59.859 --> 02:38:01.663
MARISHA: We were forced.

02:38:01.663 --> 02:38:04.309
TALIESIN: The day before we left to kill the white
dragon.

02:38:04.309 --> 02:38:06.447
SAM: There's a time difference.

02:38:06.447 --> 02:38:09.685
LAURA: And if we had told any of you, your life
would have been in danger.

02:38:09.685 --> 02:38:17.314
TALIESIN: This was the best way I knew to keep her
from destroying this city outright. This was the

02:38:17.314 --> 02:38:23.348
best way that kept her from telling the red dragon
where we are. And the longer that we can keep her

02:38:23.348 --> 02:38:26.855
a tenuous ally, the longer Whitestone will stand.

02:38:26.855 --> 02:38:36.233
SAM: When she does come back with Asum, this plan
that we started in on-- it's a good one?

02:38:36.233 --> 02:38:37.930
TALIESIN: I think so.

02:38:37.930 --> 02:38:46.922
SAM: Well, we have Raishan convince Thordak that
we're amassing forces in Kymal or something.

02:38:46.922 --> 02:38:53.211
Thordak sends Raishan to get us. We "kill"
Raishan.

02:38:53.211 --> 02:38:54.525
LAURA: Mm-hmm.

02:38:54.525 --> 02:38:58.486
SAM: And then Thordak comes to check on our dead
bodies?

02:38:58.486 --> 02:39:01.629
TALIESIN: We send word of a dead dragon.

02:39:01.629 --> 02:39:04.319
SAM: How can that plan fail?

02:39:04.319 --> 02:39:09.422
LIAM: I mean, I'm not the only one who thinks
she's more dangerous than he is at this point.

02:39:09.468 --> 02:39:14.882
LAURA: Oh yes. I think if we give her access to
Thordak's body afterwards, we're asking for a lot

02:39:14.882 --> 02:39:15.803
of trouble.

02:39:15.803 --> 02:39:19.964
TALIESIN: Which is why if Keyleth can figure out a
way to cure her of this disease, it takes a big

02:39:19.964 --> 02:39:21.432
card off the table.

02:39:21.432 --> 02:39:22.805
LIAM: We've got 24 hours.

02:39:22.805 --> 02:39:24.048
MARISHA: I have ideas.

02:39:24.048 --> 02:39:27.085
TALIESIN: We have more than that, because it's
going to take quite a while. That's how long we

02:39:27.085 --> 02:39:28.274
have to make a plan.

02:39:28.274 --> 02:39:32.527
LAURA: Question. What if we do actually just kill
her?

02:39:32.527 --> 02:39:34.211
SAM: Raishan?

02:39:34.211 --> 02:39:38.572
LAURA: When we fake that we're killing her, what
if we kill her?

02:39:38.572 --> 02:39:39.850
MARISHA: Just actually kill her?

02:39:39.850 --> 02:39:42.865
TALIESIN: She's going to be expecting that, and it
will not work.

02:39:42.865 --> 02:39:47.954
TRAVIS: And she's super slippery. She just totally
like evaded Percy's sneak stabby-stab.

02:39:47.954 --> 02:39:50.092
LIAM: Is there anyone around right now?

02:39:50.092 --> 02:39:54.369
MATT: Oh yeah, no. Allura, Drake--

02:39:54.369 --> 02:39:56.575
LIAM: 20, natural 20! For perception.

02:39:56.575 --> 02:39:58.199
MATT: For perception?

02:39:58.199 --> 02:40:00.402
LIAM: Yeah. I said, "Is anyone around?" and I
rolled a 20.

02:40:00.402 --> 02:40:02.000
MATT: You guys are still in the war room.

02:40:02.000 --> 02:40:05.445
LIAM: I know, but you know what I'm talking about.
You know what I'm talking about.

02:40:05.445 --> 02:40:06.561
MATT: Oh!

02:40:06.561 --> 02:40:10.290
LIAM: There it is, it's right there. Invisible
fucking Larkin dwarf dragon.

02:40:10.290 --> 02:40:11.899
MATT: You don't see anybody else around.

02:40:11.899 --> 02:40:13.081
LIAM: All right. That's a 20.

02:40:13.081 --> 02:40:16.485
LAURA: Should we continue this conversation
downstairs?

02:40:16.485 --> 02:40:19.883
TALIESIN: First, is everybody who they say they
are? Please, if you would be so kind.

02:40:19.883 --> 02:40:23.944
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, Allura. Can we light your sage real
quick, make sure everybody's on the up and up?

02:40:23.944 --> 02:40:31.765
MATT: Allura sits up and says, "Well, I mean, it
makes sense. Asum is the one that requested we not

02:40:31.765 --> 02:40:33.803
"move the war room down to the--"

02:40:33.803 --> 02:40:36.373
TALIESIN: So why don't we move the war room now?

02:40:36.373 --> 02:40:43.419
MATT: "I think that would be the best, yes. Let us
all adjourn to the new space at the ziggurat. That

02:40:43.419 --> 02:40:45.196
"should at least keep things honest."

02:40:45.196 --> 02:40:46.376
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:40:46.376 --> 02:40:49.392
MATT: Allura picks her robes up and--

02:40:49.392 --> 02:40:51.547
SAM: Grog, your beard might go away.

02:40:51.547 --> 02:40:53.648
LAURA: (gasps) No!

02:40:53.648 --> 02:40:55.281
TRAVIS: No, it's in there.

02:40:55.281 --> 02:40:57.574
TALIESIN: It just won't grow while he's down
there.

02:40:57.574 --> 02:41:03.789
LIAM: I mean for science, right? Let's go. You
look really good without a beard, Grog. I've

02:41:03.789 --> 02:41:05.119
always thought so.

02:41:05.119 --> 02:41:06.425
TRAVIS: You shut up, you.

02:41:06.425 --> 02:41:08.379
(laughter)

02:41:08.379 --> 02:41:12.249
TRAVIS: We can go down there, I don't care.

02:41:12.249 --> 02:41:14.314
TALIESIN: All right.

02:41:14.314 --> 02:41:18.740
MATT: Okay. You guys make your way down to the
ziggurat. The guards come and start carrying

02:41:18.740 --> 02:41:23.509
chairs and other elements of the war room.
Eventually, you're all led down through the

02:41:23.509 --> 02:41:28.376
tunnels, which have been a little more refined and
given an actual more comfortable path past the

02:41:28.376 --> 02:41:34.103
now-defunct whitestone refinery that the
Briarwoods had originally established. You enter

02:41:34.103 --> 02:41:41.276
the ziggurat room. It has more lighting to it than
it previously did. A number of torches now line

02:41:41.276 --> 02:41:48.306
the walls, the sconces that are lit as the guards
progress upward. You can see the reflection to the

02:41:48.306 --> 02:41:56.331
green glass-like Whitestone material that
permeates the outside of the ziggurat. And not

02:41:56.331 --> 02:42:02.775
right by it, but partially upward there's a small
wooden platform that's been where the main base of

02:42:02.775 --> 02:42:06.427
operations for research and study is here. You see
a number of desks set out. It's been built

02:42:06.427 --> 02:42:14.793
alongside of the large pyramid-type structure. And
eventually, you all adjourn up into that space. As

02:42:14.793 --> 02:42:25.101
you go up there, you all feel a significant drop
in enchantment. All of your magical items, all of

02:42:25.101 --> 02:42:33.129
everything, gradually fades in this space. So,
Grog, you actually feel your musculature-- the

02:42:33.129 --> 02:42:38.781
Titanstone Gauntlets themselves, the effect begins
to completely fade back to your classic,

02:42:38.781 --> 02:42:40.441
Grog-like strength.

02:42:40.441 --> 02:42:42.401
TRAVIS: I feel totally fine.

02:42:42.401 --> 02:42:45.914
LAURA: Are the walls still like people?

02:42:45.914 --> 02:42:48.627
MATT: Oh, do you want to go to the top of the
ziggurat and check?

02:42:48.627 --> 02:42:51.126
MARISHA: Oh.

02:42:51.126 --> 02:42:53.426
TALIESIN: Not yet. After the meeting.

02:42:53.426 --> 02:42:56.734
MARISHA: Did they have like a clean-up crew down
there?

02:42:56.734 --> 02:43:02.608
TALIESIN: It's a guy on a scaffold with a scrub
brush going, "Ew. Ew."

02:43:02.608 --> 02:43:04.965
LAURA: They're really clean naked bodies now.

02:43:04.965 --> 02:43:06.563
LIAM: Brush cleaning out the fingernails.

02:43:06.563 --> 02:43:11.187
MATT: At this point, they're looking around.
Everyone who's journeyed with you towards this new

02:43:11.187 --> 02:43:17.398
meeting place, the ziggurat, is of the same
physicality they were at the meeting room. Any

02:43:17.398 --> 02:43:22.402
illusions that would have been cast aside or dispelled
at this point seem to not be present. So everyone

02:43:22.402 --> 02:43:26.521
is, by all intents and purposes, who they say they
are.

02:43:26.521 --> 02:43:28.045
SAM: Okay.

02:43:28.045 --> 02:43:32.491
TALIESIN: And this also means it would
probably be impossible to scry in this room.

02:43:32.525 --> 02:43:34.108
MARISHA: Yes.

02:43:34.108 --> 02:43:37.156
MATT: Allura nods. "Yes, actually. Yes."

02:43:37.156 --> 02:43:43.360
TALIESIN: Excellent. This is where all talk must
happen now.

02:43:43.360 --> 02:43:45.737
LAURA: Where it should have been happening.

02:43:45.737 --> 02:43:54.523
TALIESIN: So now you know what we've been dealing
with for the past 72 hours. She did help with the

02:43:54.523 --> 02:43:58.449
death of that dragon. In fact, I doubt we would
have survived without her aid. She could have very

02:43:58.449 --> 02:44:00.457
easily left us there to die.

02:44:00.457 --> 02:44:10.288
LAURA: It's true. She actually revealed her entire
form during the battle. Which is quite diseased.

02:44:10.288 --> 02:44:13.561
TALIESIN: At least it appeared diseased.

02:44:13.561 --> 02:44:17.977
MARISHA: She's definitely not as strong as the
others, but far more clever.

02:44:17.977 --> 02:44:28.388
TALIESIN: And she knows where we are. And what our
plans are. And every inch of this place. Including

02:44:28.388 --> 02:44:29.767
this thing.

02:44:29.767 --> 02:44:37.210
MATT: "Well then, what do you presume we do?"

02:44:37.210 --> 02:44:43.554
SAM: We don't really have a choice, we have to
work with her to some extent. We can make it hard

02:44:43.554 --> 02:44:49.737
for her, and we can be assholes to her, and go
tell her to get Asum for us. But other than that,

02:44:49.737 --> 02:44:51.323
we have to work with her.

02:44:51.323 --> 02:44:54.147
LIAM: What's the benefit of working with her?

02:44:54.147 --> 02:44:58.054
SAM: Because if we don't, she can destroy
Whitestone whenever she feels like it.

02:44:58.054 --> 02:45:01.731
LIAM: What if we tell her we're going to fake her
death, and then we kill her for real?

02:45:01.731 --> 02:45:05.037
SAM: That's fine, if she ever gets close enough
for us to kill her.

02:45:05.037 --> 02:45:06.422
TALIESIN: She's not going to.

02:45:06.422 --> 02:45:08.593
TRAVIS: She evaded it really easy.

02:45:08.593 --> 02:45:13.708
SAM: Why would she need to come face to face with
us in that plan, ever? She could say, "I'm going

02:45:13.708 --> 02:45:16.995
"to go meet them in Kymal. Oh, I died!"

02:45:16.995 --> 02:45:23.511
TALIESIN: Our best bet is maybe-- hopefully enough
of us still have our strength. Maybe at the end if

02:45:23.511 --> 02:45:25.778
she has been ravaged by the red dragon.

02:45:25.778 --> 02:45:28.122
TRAVIS: I agree.

02:45:28.122 --> 02:45:30.495
LAURA: And then we try to defeat her after that?

02:45:30.495 --> 02:45:34.614
TRAVIS: I agree. Our play is the finish line.
That's it. Not a moment before.

02:45:34.614 --> 02:45:37.428
LAURA: But we have to beat her to it. If she gets
a hold of that stone--

02:45:37.428 --> 02:45:39.773
MARISHA: It's what she wants.

02:45:39.773 --> 02:45:40.740
LAURA: Yes.

02:45:40.740 --> 02:45:42.006
TALIESIN: Our hope is to break the stone.

02:45:42.006 --> 02:45:43.447
MARISHA: We can't break the stone.

02:45:43.447 --> 02:45:45.425
TALIESIN: Only because no one has.

02:45:45.425 --> 02:45:50.639
SAM: If we draw Thordak to us, at least we control
the battlefield. She could still be lying in wait

02:45:50.639 --> 02:45:52.747
to pounce on his body the second we kill him.

02:45:52.747 --> 02:46:00.560
LIAM: If. We have to hope that she's actually
going to fight with us. She's done it once. We

02:46:00.560 --> 02:46:03.927
don't know that she's going to do it again. We
don't know.

02:46:03.927 --> 02:46:10.745
MARISHA: They mentioned moving the stone that
shouldn't have been able to have been moved.

02:46:10.745 --> 02:46:18.296
Correct? They moved it inside of Thordak, and then
Thordak left with the stone in him, right?

02:46:18.296 --> 02:46:21.067
TALIESIN: Yes, which I don't think should have
been possible.

02:46:21.067 --> 02:46:28.935
MARISHA: Right. So how did they do it? Because I'm
also looking at another thing that is supposedly

02:46:28.935 --> 02:46:30.857
immovable.

02:46:30.857 --> 02:46:34.767
LAURA, MARISHA, and TALIESIN: Supposedly.

02:46:34.767 --> 02:46:37.873
TALIESIN: Oh, it's possible. Nothing is
impossible.

02:46:37.873 --> 02:46:41.089
LAURA: Are you suggesting we put the vortex of
doom inside one of us?

02:46:41.089 --> 02:46:43.272
MARISHA: Kind of, yeah. That's what I was--

02:46:43.272 --> 02:46:49.322
MATT: Allura immediately puts her hands up and
goes, "No! No. No. No."

02:46:49.322 --> 02:46:50.977
MARISHA: There's got to be a way to move it.

02:46:50.977 --> 02:46:52.329
SAM: To do what, though?

02:46:52.329 --> 02:46:57.433
MATT: "This is an absence of magic. It is a void
of magic. It is a maw that devours magic. The

02:46:57.433 --> 02:46:59.612
"enchantment that we put within Thordak is pure
magic."

02:46:59.612 --> 02:47:02.716
LIAM: And you've been working on it for months,
and you are smarter than us.

02:47:02.716 --> 02:47:04.151
MATT: "Well."

02:47:04.151 --> 02:47:07.483
LAURA: Right. No way to transport it? None at
all?

02:47:07.483 --> 02:47:10.273
MARISHA: It could be the only thing that could
break the stone!

02:47:10.273 --> 02:47:16.274
LAURA: Think about it. If we could get that stone
next to the vortex, he'd be fucked.

02:47:16.274 --> 02:47:23.985
MATT: "Right! So what, we take a few wooden two by
fours and push it along? Look, everything I know,

02:47:23.985 --> 02:47:35.270
"everything I've studied, everything I've spent my
entire life working for is useless near that."

02:47:35.270 --> 02:47:38.828
LAURA: This is a temple to Ioun, right?

02:47:38.828 --> 02:47:39.983
MATT: "It was."

02:47:39.983 --> 02:47:41.503
LAURA: The goddess of knowledge?

02:47:41.503 --> 02:47:44.134
SAM: Sure.

02:47:44.134 --> 02:47:48.093
MATT: "The only person I know of who rightfully
worshipped Ioun was Brom."

02:47:48.093 --> 02:47:49.490
LAURA: Brom?

02:47:49.490 --> 02:47:51.112
SAM: Of the Clasp?

02:47:51.112 --> 02:47:55.424
MATT: "Arbiter Brom. He was of the council with
us."

02:47:55.424 --> 02:47:58.620
LAURA: And he's in Emon, potentially?

02:47:58.620 --> 02:48:04.871
MATT: "According to Raishan. With Tofor and--"

02:48:04.871 --> 02:48:06.582
LAURA: Brom's with Asum?

02:48:06.582 --> 02:48:07.587
MATT: "Yes."

02:48:07.587 --> 02:48:17.302
TALIESIN: What holds it there? It's a shame we
can't open a giant door and push it down here.

02:48:17.302 --> 02:48:20.944
MARISHA: What did you just say?

02:48:20.944 --> 02:48:22.481
TALIESIN: We can't do it.

02:48:22.481 --> 02:48:23.802
MARISHA: What? Say it again, one more time?

02:48:23.802 --> 02:48:26.268
TALIESIN: It's a shame we can't open a giant door
and push the dragon in here.

02:48:26.268 --> 02:48:28.261
SAM: How on earth could we--?

02:48:28.261 --> 02:48:32.461
TALIESIN: We couldn't do it. It won't work.
Because that side of the door won't open by its

02:48:32.461 --> 02:48:38.736
very nature. No door can be opened to this room.
No one can get in or out without someone walking.

02:48:38.736 --> 02:48:40.625
LAURA: You couldn't have used the gate scroll in
here.

02:48:40.625 --> 02:48:44.069
TALIESIN: I'm trying to even conceive of a machine
that could move this. But I don't understand why

02:48:44.069 --> 02:48:45.289
it's here in the first place.

02:48:45.289 --> 02:48:51.619
SAM: I don't think the secret to defeating Thordak
is moving this thing.

02:48:51.619 --> 02:49:02.961
TALIESIN: It's a shame we couldn't. We have a line
in the sand of how close we can get to this thing

02:49:02.961 --> 02:49:04.654
with magic, correct?

02:49:04.654 --> 02:49:17.646
MATT: "This way." And she leads you back down the
ziggurat, out to the entrance where you guys

02:49:17.646 --> 02:49:29.172
entered this large chamber. And about 20 or so
meters back, you can see there is a specific

02:49:29.172 --> 02:49:36.851
wooden support beam that is structured within this
tunnel. And on that beam, elements of it are

02:49:36.851 --> 02:49:43.596
painted black. And she goes, "This is the
perimeter in which the siphon devours magic

02:49:43.596 --> 02:49:45.087
"inward."

02:49:45.087 --> 02:49:50.140
MARISHA: How big is it? How big is it, roughly?

02:49:50.140 --> 02:49:51.391
MATT: What, the--?

02:49:51.391 --> 02:49:52.582
MARISHA: Perimeter.

02:49:52.582 --> 02:50:01.916
MATT: "I'd say it'd take a half-mile?"

02:50:01.916 --> 02:50:11.728
MARISHA: Damn, this place is really big. And it's
encased in stone, yeah? Kind of, right? Were we

02:50:11.728 --> 02:50:14.739
encased in whitestone? Right?

02:50:14.739 --> 02:50:16.431
TALIESIN: In stone. I've got a terrible idea.

02:50:16.431 --> 02:50:17.501
MARISHA: Tell me!

02:50:17.501 --> 02:50:28.533
TALIESIN: What happens to magical creatures when
they enter the circle? Have we experimented at all

02:50:28.533 --> 02:50:32.667
to find out what would happen to a magical
creature? A creature whose very essence is magic?

02:50:32.667 --> 02:50:34.768
MATT: "I don't know."

02:50:34.768 --> 02:50:38.965
TALIESIN: (sighs) There's no humane way to do
this.

02:50:38.965 --> 02:50:41.903
SAM: Sure there is! Kiki, get a fey creature in
here.

02:50:41.903 --> 02:50:43.691
LAURA: Yeah, that's what I was thinking, send him
in.

02:50:43.691 --> 02:50:46.404
MARISHA: Oh yeah, they die and they go right back
to their plane.

02:50:46.404 --> 02:50:48.313
SAM: No, I think they just die.

02:50:48.313 --> 02:50:53.708
TALIESIN: And even if they do go back to their
plane, they may not be able to in there, they may

02:50:53.708 --> 02:50:56.959
wither and actually die. I just wanted to put that
on the table.

02:50:56.959 --> 02:50:58.756
MARISHA: Are you trying to make me feel better
about any of this?

02:50:58.756 --> 02:51:05.110
TALIESIN: I don't want to lie to you about this.
I've been practicing intense levels of honesty, if

02:51:05.110 --> 02:51:07.596
not telling the whole truth.

02:51:07.596 --> 02:51:11.065
TRAVIS: Sidebar. Do we have all the Vestiges that
the sphinx told us about?

02:51:11.065 --> 02:51:12.008
SAM: No.

02:51:12.008 --> 02:51:13.149
TRAVIS: What else is there?

02:51:13.149 --> 02:51:14.667
SAM: There's one in the Fire Plane.

02:51:14.667 --> 02:51:16.983
LIAM: Something for Pickle.

02:51:16.983 --> 02:51:19.288
MARISHA: The Dawn Martyr. Dawn Martyr?

02:51:19.288 --> 02:51:24.982
TRAVIS: I know I'm not the smartest one in the
group, but we don't know what the fuck we're

02:51:24.982 --> 02:51:29.056
talking about with this little sphere. Why don't
we go find that last Vestige and see what it turns up?

02:51:29.056 --> 02:51:31.166
LAURA: I don't know if we have a lot of time--

02:51:31.166 --> 02:51:33.615
TALIESIN: We have time. In a day.

02:51:33.615 --> 02:51:35.554
MARISHA: I mean, only if we--

02:51:35.554 --> 02:51:42.109
TALIESIN: In a day she returns. We chose a place,
we move our forces in there. We have days where

02:51:42.109 --> 02:51:45.826
she could be looking for us, and then when she
disappears it's going to take a day or two for him

02:51:45.826 --> 02:51:50.103
to really find out. It will be about three to four
days before anything actually happens.

02:51:50.103 --> 02:51:55.087
SAM: What are we doing, going after this Vestige
when-- can any of us even use it?

02:51:55.129 --> 02:51:56.329
MARISHA and LAURA: Pike.

02:51:56.329 --> 02:52:02.242
TRAVIS: Well, I can. Kima might. I'm not much for
poetry, but it seems sort of poetic that Thordak

02:52:02.242 --> 02:52:06.520
came from the Fire Plane, and the last Vestige
we're looking for is in the Fire Plane.

02:52:06.520 --> 02:52:10.397
MARISHA: Also, we might be able to find some
information on the stone.

02:52:10.397 --> 02:52:11.596
LAURA: This is true.

02:52:11.596 --> 02:52:14.204
SAM: The Fire Plane isn't just like Dallas.

02:52:14.204 --> 02:52:21.128
TALIESIN: It actually is quite like Dallas. I
think that's a very reasonable comparison.

02:52:21.128 --> 02:52:23.191
SAM: It's a horrible place where we could
all die.

02:52:23.191 --> 02:52:26.443
TRAVIS: Well, so was the Feywild, and we didn't--

02:52:26.443 --> 02:52:31.322
SAM: We're risking our hides for something that
might benefit one of us, maybe.

02:52:31.322 --> 02:52:34.522
LAURA: Well, that's what we've been doing this
entire time.

02:52:34.522 --> 02:52:36.699
TRAVIS: That's basically all of our choices at
this point.

02:52:36.699 --> 02:52:40.665
MARISHA: We could go in with the rest of the Fire
Ashari that are there. We can meet up with

02:52:40.665 --> 02:52:47.738
Cerkonos. Is this whole ziggurat encased in 
whitestone?

02:52:47.738 --> 02:52:57.884
MATT: The ziggurat itself is built from stone, and
then the upper exterior of it is covered in this

02:52:57.884 --> 02:53:04.263
green glass-like substance that is distilled
whitestone residuum.

02:53:04.263 --> 02:53:10.490
TALIESIN: I have a plan. It will take a little bit
of time, but it's vicious.

02:53:10.490 --> 02:53:12.602
MARISHA: What?

02:53:12.602 --> 02:53:17.178
TALIESIN: It probably wouldn't work. Well, let's
find out what happens to a creature inside here

02:53:17.178 --> 02:53:18.050
before we--

02:53:18.050 --> 02:53:19.523
TRAVIS: A regular creature or a Feywild creature?

02:53:19.523 --> 02:53:21.530
MARISHA: Okay, I actually do have Conjure Woodland
Beings.

02:53:21.530 --> 02:53:24.804
LAURA: That's not a magic creature though, it's a
woodland being.

02:53:24.804 --> 02:53:27.664
MARISHA: No, woodland beings can be like fey
creatures.

02:53:27.664 --> 02:53:28.507
LAURA: Really?

02:53:28.507 --> 02:53:29.597
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.

02:53:29.597 --> 02:53:30.647
TALIESIN: Something small.

02:53:30.647 --> 02:53:32.539
TRAVIS: Do it! Oh my god, do it!

02:53:32.539 --> 02:53:35.302
LAURA: Just a fairy. Just a teeny little fairy.

02:53:35.302 --> 02:53:36.876
MARISHA: Okay.

02:53:36.876 --> 02:53:38.332
MATT: What level's that? That is--

02:53:38.332 --> 02:53:39.876
MARISHA: Third level.

02:53:39.876 --> 02:53:45.582
TRAVIS: Wait, if you like conjure it outside and
walk in, is it going to go poof and disappear?

02:53:45.582 --> 02:53:46.750
LAURA: Potentially. We'll find out.

02:53:46.750 --> 02:53:47.852
MATT: A fourth level, you mean.

02:53:47.852 --> 02:53:48.930
MARISHA: Sorry, fourth level.

02:53:48.930 --> 02:53:50.999
MATT: Yeah, so you can create some fey creatures,
yeah. What are you summoning?

02:53:50.999 --> 02:53:54.091
MARISHA: What makes sense?

02:53:54.091 --> 02:53:57.388
TRAVIS: What's going to squeal?

02:53:57.388 --> 02:53:59.932
TALIESIN: We're on one side of the line. Send it
to the other, see what happens.

02:53:59.932 --> 02:54:01.929
MARISHA: I'll summon a--

02:54:01.929 --> 02:54:03.212
SAM: Little pixie!

02:54:03.212 --> 02:54:06.403
MARISHA: A little-- (stutters) A little pixie.

02:54:06.403 --> 02:54:09.683
LAURA: (copying Marisha) Lalittle lilittle li-- A
little pixie.

02:54:09.683 --> 02:54:11.529
MARISHA: A lillul lillul pixie.

02:54:11.529 --> 02:54:15.601
SAM: Hi, little pixie! Go in that room!

02:54:15.601 --> 02:54:20.050
TALIESIN: This may be, by the way, how we deal
with Raishan.

02:54:20.050 --> 02:54:21.750
MARISHA: What?

02:54:21.750 --> 02:54:23.430
MATT: Okay. So you conjure a pixie?

02:54:23.430 --> 02:54:25.364
MARISHA: Sure. And I send her in.

02:54:25.364 --> 02:54:33.019
MATT: Pixie flies in. Continues to fly in. Nothing
happens.

02:54:33.019 --> 02:54:34.273
TALIESIN: Pixie's fine?

02:54:34.273 --> 02:54:35.424
MATT: Pixie seems fine.

02:54:35.424 --> 02:54:37.284
SAM: Pixie's not a magical creature, I guess.

02:54:37.284 --> 02:54:38.569
LAURA: Isn't it, though?

02:54:38.569 --> 02:54:43.621
SAM: Has magic, maybe. Isn't a magical being.

02:54:43.621 --> 02:54:47.431
TALIESIN: Can you make the pixie do something? Try
and have the pixie do something magical.

02:54:47.431 --> 02:54:54.192
MARISHA: Yeah. I have them. Can't they cast like
Confusion or something like that? Or can they cast--?

02:54:54.192 --> 02:54:55.748
SAM: Polymorph.

02:54:55.748 --> 02:54:59.700
MATT: They can cast Confusion, they can cast
Polymorph, they can cast things like that.

02:54:59.700 --> 02:55:03.113
MARISHA: Hey! Try and Polymorph me!

02:55:03.113 --> 02:55:08.139
MATT: Pixie turns around and nothing happens.

02:55:08.139 --> 02:55:09.704
MARISHA: Nothing?

02:55:09.704 --> 02:55:13.723
MATT: Pixie looks confused. "What? Sorry."

02:55:13.723 --> 02:55:19.918
TALIESIN: It's all right, you did very well. How
do you feel? Do you feel all right?

02:55:19.918 --> 02:55:26.983
MATT: Technically, this pixie--

02:55:26.983 --> 02:55:31.325
TRAVIS: Touch it.

02:55:31.325 --> 02:55:36.988
MATT: We'll say for the purposes of this, sure.
There is very basic communication. The pixie is--

02:55:36.988 --> 02:55:38.319
TALIESIN: Tinkerbell.

02:55:38.319 --> 02:55:46.706
MATT: Yeah, Sylvan is the language that it speaks,
so it is close enough to Elvish that those who

02:55:46.706 --> 02:55:48.998
speak Elvish can like interpret elements of it.

02:55:48.998 --> 02:55:52.391
MARISHA: Oh, I know Sylvan. I know Sylvan. Hey!
How do you feel?

02:55:52.391 --> 02:55:55.517
MATT: "A little queasy, that's all."

02:55:55.517 --> 02:55:56.904
MARISHA: Queasy? Yeah?

02:55:56.904 --> 02:55:58.137
MATT: "It's weird."

02:55:58.137 --> 02:56:06.470
MARISHA: Hmm. Hey, will you do me a favor and
don't hold it against me?

02:56:06.470 --> 02:56:11.128
TALIESIN: Why don't you let it leave?

02:56:11.128 --> 02:56:13.062
TRAVIS: Just go do it! Just do it!

02:56:13.062 --> 02:56:14.494
MARISHA: Will you go touch that black orb?

02:56:14.494 --> 02:56:16.101
TALIESIN: No no no, don't do that!

02:56:16.101 --> 02:56:18.563
TRAVIS: Yeah yeah yeah, go touch it. She meant
what she said.

02:56:18.563 --> 02:56:20.807
MATT: I mean, she's only listening to her, so--

02:56:20.807 --> 02:56:22.827
LIAM: Yeah, it doesn't matter what Percy says.

02:56:22.827 --> 02:56:25.408
TRAVIS: Do it. Fucking do it.

02:56:25.408 --> 02:56:27.432
SAM: Let's see if it goes to the other world.

02:56:27.432 --> 02:56:29.547
LAURA: You don't know where it goes.

02:56:29.547 --> 02:56:30.937
TALIESIN: That's right, I don't know.

02:56:30.937 --> 02:56:32.542
LIAM: No, you don't know what she's talking about.
It's Esperanto.

02:56:32.542 --> 02:56:33.723
TRAVIS: You don't speak Sylvan.

02:56:33.723 --> 02:56:35.367
TALIESIN: I've already done my dumb stuff for the
day.

02:56:35.367 --> 02:56:37.800
LAURA: Stab stab stab.

02:56:37.800 --> 02:56:41.085
TALIESIN: It would've been so badass!

02:56:41.085 --> 02:56:46.772
MATT: All right, so yeah. You continue to walk as
the pixie floats up towards the top of the

02:56:46.772 --> 02:56:50.285
ziggurat. You get to the top and you notice that
no, all the bodies have been removed. It's been

02:56:50.285 --> 02:56:51.464
cleaned up.

02:56:51.464 --> 02:56:53.178
LAURA: It's just an empty pyramid-y thing now.

02:56:53.178 --> 02:56:58.899
MATT: Yeah, it's like this empty platform now with
the walls, encased within a small colosseum. And

02:56:58.899 --> 02:57:06.137
there it is, the general spinning black marble.
The pixie approaches and like--

02:57:06.137 --> 02:57:09.769
LAURA and TALIESIN: (whines worriedly)

02:57:09.769 --> 02:57:13.364
MARISHA: Yeah! Yeah. You got this.

02:57:13.364 --> 02:57:17.493
MATT: Touches it, and you watch the pixie go-- and
is gone.

02:57:17.493 --> 02:57:20.930
MARISHA: Hmm. So as we expected, yeah.

02:57:20.930 --> 02:57:22.485
TRAVIS: Well, hold on. Wait.

02:57:22.485 --> 02:57:29.735
LAURA: Wait.

02:57:29.735 --> 02:57:33.229
MARISHA: I don't think she's coming back, yeah.

02:57:33.229 --> 02:57:37.737
LAURA: Hey Allura, how many things did you throw
in the orb?

02:57:37.737 --> 02:57:44.403
MATT: You see her in the back leaning against the
wall like she's seen this a hundred times. "Oh,

02:57:44.403 --> 02:57:53.700
"many things. Chairs, outfits, pieces of stone,
metals. We've put all kinds of things."

02:57:53.700 --> 02:57:54.775
SAM: Any animals?

02:57:54.775 --> 02:57:55.735
LIAM: Anything alive?

02:57:55.735 --> 02:57:57.163
MATT: "No, nothing living!"

02:57:57.163 --> 02:57:59.522
TRAVIS: What was the biggest thing you put in
there?

02:57:59.522 --> 02:58:07.336
MATT: "Your desk chair. Cassandra said it would be
all right."

02:58:07.336 --> 02:58:09.532
TALIESIN: (sighs) Yes.

02:58:09.532 --> 02:58:14.161
LAURA: Have you put a box around it? Just
encapsulated it completely?

02:58:14.161 --> 02:58:19.204
MATT: "We tried, and upon moving it, once it
contacted it did not move with the box. It just

02:58:19.204 --> 02:58:21.739
"crushed and absorbed the box itself."

02:58:21.739 --> 02:58:28.712
TALIESIN: So. I have an interesting request which
may end up being too complicated. I'm not sure.

02:58:28.712 --> 02:58:30.765
TRAVIS: Probably.

02:58:30.765 --> 02:58:36.388
TALIESIN: Can we build a teleportation sigil
directly above it? Outside of its range?

02:58:36.388 --> 02:58:40.645
MATT: "Given the better part of a year, yes."

02:58:40.645 --> 02:58:44.953
LIAM: So you're saying there's a chance?

02:58:44.953 --> 02:58:50.515
TALIESIN: Can we build one in the hallway leading
to this room?

02:58:50.515 --> 02:58:54.625
MATT: "A temporary one, as in like a--"

02:58:54.625 --> 02:58:56.702
MARISHA: Like a spell.

02:58:56.702 --> 02:59:03.219
MATT: "Like a brief spell, yes. I can do that now.
It's the permanent installation of one that takes

02:59:03.219 --> 02:59:04.958
"an exorbitant period of time."

02:59:04.958 --> 02:59:12.152
TALIESIN: As long as we have some way of knowing
what point at which we re-enter this room. Then we

02:59:12.152 --> 02:59:17.334
at least have a way of having it chase us into its
range.

02:59:17.334 --> 02:59:18.832
MARISHA: Oh man.

02:59:18.832 --> 02:59:21.982
TALIESIN: Or better still, if we run one way and
it runs the other.

02:59:21.982 --> 02:59:27.106
MARISHA: Have you been in contact? Have you
attempted to scry, or do a Locate Object spell on

02:59:27.106 --> 02:59:30.747
anything that you've thrown in? Probably?

02:59:30.747 --> 02:59:35.434
MATT: "Yes, but unfortunately there's been no way
of connecting anything that goes through. It just

02:59:35.434 --> 02:59:36.554
"vanishes."

02:59:36.554 --> 02:59:41.581
SAM: I think that's a fucking terrible idea.

02:59:41.581 --> 02:59:46.561
TRAVIS: (chanting) Fire Plane.

02:59:46.561 --> 02:59:50.920
SAM: What are you talking about? We can't lure a
dragon into a teleportation circle big enough to

02:59:50.920 --> 02:59:55.642
get a dragon through, and then somehow assume that
the dragon's going to keep running into the room

02:59:55.642 --> 02:59:59.898
with no magic? And then what are we also going to
assume? That it's going to jump into the crazy

02:59:59.898 --> 03:00:04.653
Vecna circle and become a ninth level of hell
after that? We have no idea! That's a terrible

03:00:04.653 --> 03:00:06.276
idea! I'm vetoing it.

03:00:06.276 --> 03:00:08.992
TRAVIS: I third that.

03:00:08.992 --> 03:00:11.746
TALIESIN: The cereal shiller has a point.

03:00:11.746 --> 03:00:18.472
LIAM: That idea's not grrreat!

03:00:18.472 --> 03:00:20.205
(laughter)

03:00:20.205 --> 03:00:22.687
LAURA: You've been waiting! Waiting to find a time
to say it, haven't you?

03:00:22.687 --> 03:00:26.421
LIAM: Nope! Just drunkenly popped in my head.

03:00:26.421 --> 03:00:30.589
TALIESIN: Yes, Grog. You have a point?

03:00:30.589 --> 03:00:32.185
TRAVIS: Fire Plane.

03:00:32.185 --> 03:00:40.700
TALIESIN: If we are going to do the Fire Plane, if
that is going to happen, then we cannot go until

03:00:40.700 --> 03:00:45.790
preparations start getting made for the place at
which we're going to have this confrontation. We

03:00:45.790 --> 03:00:53.664
need to pick a point, preferably far from here. Is
there a ruined city?

03:00:53.664 --> 03:00:58.304
SAM: What, for us to lure Raishan-slash-Thordak to?

03:00:58.304 --> 03:01:00.029
LAURA: What about Fort Daxio?

03:01:00.029 --> 03:01:06.069
SAM: Fort Daxio's near Emon. And so is Kymal.

03:01:06.069 --> 03:01:12.854
MATT: "Well, it's north of Emon. Kymal's east of
it. And the Ironsea Ridge. But Kymal's filled

03:01:12.899 --> 03:01:14.287
"with civilians."

03:01:14.287 --> 03:01:17.772
LAURA: Fort Daxio has an army gathering there
already, right?

03:01:17.772 --> 03:01:22.433
MATT: "Well, Fort Daxio has a piece of an army.
Most of it went to Syngorn and we haven't heard since."

03:01:22.433 --> 03:01:25.384
TALIESIN: Fort Daxio at least does have soldiers
already.

03:01:25.384 --> 03:01:27.715
LAURA: Well, Syngorn is gathering their forces as
well.

03:01:27.715 --> 03:01:31.492
MATT: "Have you reached out to Syngorn, let them
know this was going to happen? You mentioned that

03:01:31.492 --> 03:01:32.489
"they were coming to power?"

03:01:32.489 --> 03:01:33.630
LAURA: We have.

03:01:33.630 --> 03:01:37.774
MATT: "Well, we need to reach out to the resources
we have and call them in."

03:01:37.774 --> 03:01:38.940
LAURA and LIAM: Yes.

03:01:38.940 --> 03:01:42.944
TALIESIN: Everyone, is Fort Daxio where this
confrontation is going to happen?

03:01:42.944 --> 03:01:45.610
LAURA: We haven't been to Fort Daxio.

03:01:45.610 --> 03:01:49.999
SAM: We should probably go check it out. But
everyone wants to go to the Fire Plane, get some

03:01:49.999 --> 03:01:50.998
armor.

03:01:50.998 --> 03:01:58.055
TALIESIN: We go to Fort Daxio to start everything
up. While they prepare, we can maybe make a trip

03:01:58.055 --> 03:02:02.296
to the Fire Plane once things are prepared. They
will not need us to organize the armies and gather

03:02:02.296 --> 03:02:03.448
forces.

03:02:03.448 --> 03:02:08.447
MARISHA: It's really frustrating. I feel like we
have all the pieces here. I just can't figure it out.

03:02:08.447 --> 03:02:12.517
TALIESIN: We have all the pieces buried underneath
every civilian.

03:02:12.517 --> 03:02:17.824
MARISHA: I'm really obsessed on this ziggurat
thing. Have you thrown any whitestone into the

03:02:17.824 --> 03:02:18.667
ziggurat?

03:02:18.667 --> 03:02:19.715
TALIESIN: No, don't do that.

03:02:19.715 --> 03:02:21.302
LAURA: I'm sure they already have.

03:02:21.302 --> 03:02:22.443
MATT: "We have."

03:02:22.443 --> 03:02:27.990
SAM: It's going to be fine, Keyleth. After we kill
Thordak and Raishan becomes super-powerful,

03:02:27.990 --> 03:02:35.294
Raishan will come here and get the Vecna orb and
unleash all sorts of hells on the world, and then

03:02:35.294 --> 03:02:36.668
we'll know what it was!

03:02:36.668 --> 03:02:38.641
LIAM: I mean, that's basically what's going to
happen.

03:02:38.641 --> 03:02:40.783
TALIESIN: That's a very good plan.

03:02:40.783 --> 03:02:43.918
SAM: Yeah, I mean, we can't really do anything
about it.

03:02:43.918 --> 03:02:47.012
MARISHA: Which is why it's frustrating, because I
feel like we can beat her to the fucking punch.

03:02:47.012 --> 03:02:53.062
LIAM: Yeah, I think Thordak's a fucking meathead
and we should take care of Raishan ahead of time.

03:02:53.062 --> 03:02:55.927
MARISHA: You already know how I feel.

03:02:55.927 --> 03:03:00.144
TALIESIN: I think you're mad to think we can do
that. I think that you're mad to think we're

03:03:00.144 --> 03:03:03.007
actually going to see her again before the final
confrontation.

03:03:03.007 --> 03:03:04.659
TRAVIS: Yeah, we're not going to see her.

03:03:04.659 --> 03:03:06.104
TALIESIN: I think she's going to stay far, far
away.

03:03:06.104 --> 03:03:07.239
LAURA: No. She knows.

03:03:07.239 --> 03:03:13.355
TALIESIN: I took that shot specifically to see
where she was sitting and see where we were

03:03:13.355 --> 03:03:14.352
sitting with her.

03:03:14.352 --> 03:03:18.550
LAURA: You took that shot specifically to stab her
three times in the back, Percy.

03:03:18.550 --> 03:03:21.216
TALIESIN: It also worked that we found out she
wasn't there.

03:03:21.216 --> 03:03:23.494
LIAM: Yes, revisionist history.

03:03:23.494 --> 03:03:25.956
LAURA: I thought you were practicing honesty.

03:03:25.956 --> 03:03:29.644
TRAVIS: That's like saying I farted because my
stomach hurt, and then I found out it stunk as well.

03:03:29.644 --> 03:03:34.793
TALIESIN: I was aware it could go horribly wrong,
which is why I was prepared to say something.

03:03:34.793 --> 03:03:37.026
LIAM: Likely, there's a master plan; we
understand.

03:03:37.026 --> 03:03:41.360
TALIESIN: I'm not saying it was the best plan.

03:03:41.360 --> 03:03:46.236
TRAVIS: Cool. Fort Daxio then? Check it out?

03:03:46.236 --> 03:03:50.621
TALIESIN: Does anybody else have anything to say
to this?

03:03:50.621 --> 03:03:54.622
MARISHA: We basically don't have a plan. We're
going somewhere until we come up with a plan in

03:03:54.622 --> 03:03:55.586
the meantime.

03:03:55.586 --> 03:03:59.688
TALIESIN: No, we're preparing all of our forces at
Fort Daxio.

03:03:59.688 --> 03:04:05.744
MATT: Cassandra says, "If Fort Daxio is to be the
place where this is to go down, then that will be

03:04:05.744 --> 03:04:07.417
"the place we'll send our allies."

03:04:07.417 --> 03:04:10.881
MARISHA: Jesus. Let's put all of our eggs in one
basket.

03:04:10.881 --> 03:04:13.757
SAM: Yeah. But what else are we saving
them for? This is it.

03:04:13.757 --> 03:04:19.497
TALIESIN: This is the omelette. Where do we want
our allies? Far away from the red dragon?

03:04:19.497 --> 03:04:22.838
MARISHA: You don't feel like we are stepping into
every trap that Raishan has laid?

03:04:22.838 --> 03:04:24.614
SAM: What else can we do?

03:04:24.614 --> 03:04:26.060
MARISHA: Kill Raishan first!

03:04:26.060 --> 03:04:31.078
SAM: You can't heal the disease. We can't control
this orb. There's nothing else we can do.

03:04:31.078 --> 03:04:33.847
MARISHA: It doesn't matter! We just need her to believe
that I can cure her disease.

03:04:33.847 --> 03:04:37.625
LAURA: Let's be honest. Raishan wants Thordak
dead. That's her endgame as well.

03:04:37.625 --> 03:04:39.472
LIAM: That's the only thing we can count on.

03:04:39.472 --> 03:04:42.613
TALIESIN: Because right now Raishan could have us
all dead.

03:04:42.613 --> 03:04:48.183
TRAVIS: Are you saying you want Raishan to go with
you one-on-one so you can do the Melora thing, and

03:04:48.183 --> 03:04:52.946
then maybe you take her out? And you want a shot
at it before we try anything else? Because I'll

03:04:52.946 --> 03:04:54.117
grant you that.

03:04:54.117 --> 03:04:55.954
MARISHA: I could try. That's what I was trying to
bait her into.

03:04:55.954 --> 03:04:58.075
LAURA: She's not going to show up.

03:04:58.075 --> 03:05:06.203
MATT: Allura brings her hand up, "I've done plenty
of research on these. I mean no offense to you,

03:05:06.203 --> 03:05:12.415
"Keyleth, but you convincing an entity that exists
on deception through deception to believe you in

03:05:12.415 --> 03:05:17.814
"that regard? And based on that conversation, she
already seems to see through that ruse. I would

03:05:17.814 --> 03:05:18.905
"not recommend it."

03:05:18.905 --> 03:05:20.926
LIAM: Allura, any chance you know the Gate spell?

03:05:20.926 --> 03:05:22.670
MATT: "No, that is far beyond my capabilities."

03:05:22.670 --> 03:05:25.097
TRAVIS: Yeah. Rare spell, that.

03:05:25.097 --> 03:05:31.250
TALIESIN: I'm not mad in thinking that trusting
this creature is the only option available at this

03:05:31.250 --> 03:05:38.388
point. I say "trust". Walking in this direction is
the only direction available at the moment. Any

03:05:38.388 --> 03:05:46.128
attempt to counter her at this point leads to our
destruction. She has us.

03:05:46.128 --> 03:05:52.002
TRAVIS: Yeah, no, we got that. So does anybody want
to do anything else before we go to Daxio?

03:05:52.002 --> 03:05:59.274
SAM: The only thing else that we can do before we
go to Daxio is to send word to our allies. I think

03:05:59.274 --> 03:06:14.854
we should grab Kash, send him out a quick list of
who we need to contact. Ravenites. Feywild wolves.

03:06:14.854 --> 03:06:16.243
LAURA and LIAM: Syngorn.

03:06:16.243 --> 03:06:17.972
LIAM: Zahra, Kash.

03:06:17.972 --> 03:06:19.468
LAURA: Your people, Keyleth.

03:06:19.468 --> 03:06:21.086
LIAM: Kima. Allura.

03:06:21.086 --> 03:06:23.415
TRAVIS: Wolves are on another plane. Herd is
wandering.

03:06:23.415 --> 03:06:24.893
LAURA: J'mon.

03:06:24.893 --> 03:06:36.554
SAM: That's by flute. Wait. What about our
brotherhood of-- what do we belong to? Not the Clasp--

03:06:36.554 --> 03:06:38.088
LIAM: Slayer's Take.

03:06:38.088 --> 03:06:42.529
SAM: The Slayer's Take! We can get them too,
right? We have money, we can hire them! We have a

03:06:42.529 --> 03:06:43.926
hundred thousand gold!

03:06:43.926 --> 03:06:45.961
TALIESIN: You want to hire them... Oh.

03:06:45.961 --> 03:06:48.815
LAURA: We could take out a contract against
the red dragon.

03:06:48.815 --> 03:06:50.730
SAM: Sure.

03:06:50.730 --> 03:06:54.870
LAURA: We can hire them to kill a red dragon.

03:06:54.870 --> 03:06:58.241
LIAM: Yeah. What are we going to do with that
money when we're dead? Nothing.

03:06:58.241 --> 03:07:04.988
MARISHA: We are sending everyone we know into one
centralized location. Do we really feel like

03:07:04.988 --> 03:07:06.376
that's a good idea?

03:07:06.376 --> 03:07:09.520
SAM: Yes, this is what we've built towards.

03:07:09.520 --> 03:07:10.821
MARISHA: Is it?

03:07:10.821 --> 03:07:12.837
TALIESIN: We're building a trap. Where would you
put them?

03:07:12.837 --> 03:07:17.162
MARISHA: We didn't talk about throwing everyone we
loved into the frying pan. That was not the trap.

03:07:17.162 --> 03:07:20.770
SAM: What did you think we were making allegiances
for? Just to hang out with them? We need them to

03:07:20.770 --> 03:07:22.215
fight and die for us!

03:07:22.215 --> 03:07:26.511
MARISHA: I'm down for the cause of the war. Just
not when it's a stupid fucking plan!

03:07:26.511 --> 03:07:28.234
SAM: We're going to be there too!

03:07:28.234 --> 03:07:30.690
MARISHA: We don't have a plan! We're just asking
everyone to meet in one location.

03:07:30.690 --> 03:07:33.622
LIAM: Well, we're talking about building an army.

03:07:33.622 --> 03:07:35.872
MARISHA: And then doing what with them?

03:07:35.872 --> 03:07:37.127
LIAM: To kill the general.

03:07:37.127 --> 03:07:40.283
MARISHA: And then doing what? They're just going
to be sitting there! They're going to be sitting ducks!

03:07:40.283 --> 03:07:44.205
TALIESIN: They're not going to be sitting there.
We're going to make tactical decisions about where

03:07:44.205 --> 03:07:46.148
to place everyone in and around the fort.

03:07:46.148 --> 03:07:53.824
MARISHA: I've accepted that people are going to
die. I've accepted that. I do not condone sending

03:07:53.824 --> 03:07:56.654
people to their slaughter when we don't have a
goddamn plan.

03:07:56.654 --> 03:08:00.154
TALIESIN: Well, what's your counter proposal?
Because I feel like we're making a plan here.

03:08:00.154 --> 03:08:07.067
MARISHA: I don't think that it's smart to put
every potential ally we know in one spot. Can we

03:08:07.067 --> 03:08:10.704
not divide it up? Can we not find places nearby?

03:08:10.704 --> 03:08:18.501
TALIESIN: They won't all just be in the fort.
Everyone is going to be placed.

03:08:18.501 --> 03:08:22.048
SAM: Once we get there and survey the area, we can
come up with a comfortable plan. You can make some

03:08:22.048 --> 03:08:23.826
caverns for them to hide in.

03:08:23.826 --> 03:08:28.516
TALIESIN: We're going to also create ways of
making sure the dragon can't take flight. We're

03:08:28.516 --> 03:08:33.331
going to make sure that everyone has a purpose and
a place. It will not be just a giant swath of

03:08:33.331 --> 03:08:34.753
people ready to die.

03:08:34.753 --> 03:08:36.618
SAM: We're just getting them in the right county.

03:08:36.618 --> 03:08:38.249
TALIESIN: We just need everybody in the city.

03:08:38.249 --> 03:08:41.554
MARISHA: But we also know that Raishan knows
everything that we're going to do.

03:08:41.554 --> 03:08:44.964
LAURA: She doesn't know Fort Daxio. She
doesn't know any of that.

03:08:44.964 --> 03:08:49.654
TALIESIN: She doesn't know Fort Daxio.
Honestly, she's going to have to know. She's going

03:08:49.654 --> 03:08:52.355
to have to send them. There's nothing we can do
about it.

03:08:52.355 --> 03:08:53.928
LAURA: She doesn't know about J'mon Sa Ord.

03:08:53.928 --> 03:08:55.583
MARISHA: I don't trust that she doesn't know
anything. I'm going to assume that she knows

03:08:55.583 --> 03:08:56.484
everything.

03:08:56.484 --> 03:08:57.516
TALIESIN: That's a good assumption.

03:08:57.516 --> 03:08:58.538
TRAVIS: Yeah, that's fair.

03:08:58.538 --> 03:09:02.265
TALIESIN: Even so, there's nothing that she's not
going to know, because she is what is luring him

03:09:02.265 --> 03:09:09.286
out. If we fought him here, she already knows
where we are. Right now she knows where we are.

03:09:09.286 --> 03:09:11.826
She knows everybody that's here.

03:09:11.826 --> 03:09:14.014
SAM: I go behind Keyleth and stab three times.

03:09:14.014 --> 03:09:17.179
(laughter)

03:09:17.179 --> 03:09:19.597
TALIESIN: Is this happening? Are we doing this?
I'm so excited. Yeah!

03:09:19.597 --> 03:09:21.357
SAM: No! I would so lose.

03:09:21.357 --> 03:09:24.802
MARISHA: Bring it! She's on edge, all right?

03:09:24.802 --> 03:09:31.397
TALIESIN: We have to play this the way we have to
play it. It's dangerous, but we have to assume

03:09:31.397 --> 03:09:37.015
that she will most likely not betray us until the
end.

03:09:37.015 --> 03:09:43.853
SAM: Right now, somewhere, there's a man on an
airship going, "Do you see it yet?"

03:09:43.853 --> 03:09:47.490
LAURA: They're keeping an eye out at this point,
all right?

03:09:47.490 --> 03:09:55.741
TALIESIN: They're being good. We have to assume
that she has not betrayed where we are yet, which

03:09:55.741 --> 03:10:02.638
would have been so simple. It would have been so
simple just to raze this city to the ground.

03:10:02.638 --> 03:10:09.439
MARISHA: Look at what we did with Ripley. We
walked into every trap she set for us blindly. We

03:10:09.439 --> 03:10:13.279
got cocky. We got bold. We fell for all of that.

03:10:13.279 --> 03:10:19.531
LAURA: Keyleth, we have to fight eventually. We're
not trying to be cocky about it; we're trying to

03:10:19.531 --> 03:10:21.145
set up an army!

03:10:21.145 --> 03:10:27.472
SAM: Might I point out, Keyleth, that Raishan
wanted us to go to Emon and face Thordak, and we

03:10:27.472 --> 03:10:29.673
are already not following that plan.

03:10:29.673 --> 03:10:31.015
LAURA: This is true.

03:10:31.015 --> 03:10:35.208
TALIESIN: That is the other option. Go there.

03:10:35.208 --> 03:10:44.207
LIAM: We can count on her to be duplicitous. We
gather forces; we take out Thordak. We'll figure out

03:10:44.207 --> 03:10:49.434
how we're going to do it. We're not saying throw
every spaghetti at the wall. We figure that out.

03:10:49.434 --> 03:10:52.058
Then we talk about the real enemy.

03:10:52.058 --> 03:10:56.715
TALIESIN: It's a fort. We prepare the fort. It is
what a fort is for.

03:10:56.715 --> 03:11:02.720
LAURA: If the opportunity arrives to take out
Raishan, then we do it. Beforehand. If not,

03:11:02.720 --> 03:11:05.284
immediately after Thordak is dead.

03:11:05.284 --> 03:11:09.335
MARISHA: We could all be dead.

03:11:09.335 --> 03:11:16.109
TALIESIN: Why are we not dead right now? Explain
to me why we are not dead right now.

03:11:16.109 --> 03:11:17.488
MARISHA: I honestly don't know.

03:11:17.488 --> 03:11:22.676
TALIESIN: Because this fight is going to happen.
That is why we are not dead right now. It's

03:11:22.676 --> 03:11:31.728
the only possible explanation that I can conceive
of. This fight is inevitable. Once this fight has

03:11:31.728 --> 03:11:39.004
happened? Oh, we're dead. After this fight, I have
no doubt that we are in grave danger.

03:11:39.004 --> 03:11:41.901
LAURA: After this fight, there won't be enough
people to bring us back anymore.

03:11:41.901 --> 03:11:44.659
(laughter)

03:11:44.659 --> 03:11:53.161
TALIESIN: But this fight, this first fight, is
going to happen. And we need our forces, and we

03:11:53.161 --> 03:11:59.426
need them prepared, and we need them not marching
into a city. We need them in a city holding siege.

03:11:59.426 --> 03:12:07.812
Preparing to tackle, to grapple, and to subdue as
best we can. To be difficult to find, to be

03:12:07.812 --> 03:12:12.872
surrounding. We need all of these things, and we
cannot do any of these things unless we bring him

03:12:12.872 --> 03:12:15.660
to a place where all of our power is.

03:12:15.660 --> 03:12:17.666
MARISHA: Let's go check out Fort Daxio.

03:12:17.666 --> 03:12:20.153
TRAVIS and TALIESIN: Hey! (laughter)

03:12:20.153 --> 03:12:25.486
TALIESIN: Isn't it interesting that we all feel
the need to convince her, no matter what? I'm just

03:12:25.486 --> 03:12:26.740
pointing that out.

03:12:26.740 --> 03:12:31.886
LIAM: Well, I don't know how we're going to get the
king out of the castle, but yeah.

03:12:31.886 --> 03:12:35.844
LAURA: We need to figure out if Fort Daxio is the
place to send everyone, all right? We got to

03:12:35.844 --> 03:12:37.130
fucking check it out.

03:12:37.130 --> 03:12:39.781
TRAVIS: Let's put one foot in front of the
other first, shall we?

03:12:39.781 --> 03:12:45.359
LIAM: Let's go buy some black powder. This is the
time.

03:12:45.359 --> 03:12:47.501
SAM: How do we get there? We don't know of any
trees there.

03:12:47.558 --> 03:12:48.654
MATT: (as Victor) "No!"

03:12:48.654 --> 03:12:49.959
MARISHA: I can scry.

03:12:49.959 --> 03:12:52.657
TALIESIN: Ironically, any town where you go to buy
black powder, it's always him. It's really

03:12:52.657 --> 03:12:54.246
interesting. I don't know why.

03:12:54.246 --> 03:12:56.200
LIAM: And he's in 16-bit every time!

03:12:56.200 --> 03:12:57.998
(laughter)

03:12:57.998 --> 03:13:02.032
SAM: Do we know anyone in Daxio? Can you scry
there to find a tree?

03:13:02.032 --> 03:13:04.672
MARISHA: I can scry there regardless and find a
tree, yes.

03:13:04.672 --> 03:13:07.603
TALIESIN: Does the rest of the council approve of
this ridiculous plan?

03:13:07.603 --> 03:13:08.910
TRAVIS: Yes, I approve.

03:13:08.910 --> 03:13:11.004
MARISHA: This non-plan.

03:13:11.004 --> 03:13:18.916
MATT: Allura says, "Yes. I mean, I don't know
anyone in Daxio at the moment. Riskel was the only

03:13:18.916 --> 03:13:23.958
"one. Or Riskel was the one I knew with a
connection there, and his father, Mikael, was in

03:13:23.958 --> 03:13:25.507
"Syngorn."

03:13:25.507 --> 03:13:30.968
TALIESIN: Do you think that they will be agreeable
to this plan?

03:13:30.968 --> 03:13:37.057
MATT: "Who? Those who are there, most likely.
Here, I'll give you a written..." and she pulls

03:13:37.057 --> 03:13:44.006
out a small little side scroll pouch. Scribbling a
note and says, "This is a decree from the council.

03:13:44.006 --> 03:13:53.890
"They'll have to listen to you." She finishes
writing it, rolls it up, "So they'll be at your

03:13:53.890 --> 03:13:57.392
"disposal. It's not the army; it's the reserves."

03:13:57.392 --> 03:14:04.822
TALIESIN: Any powers that you can think of, let
them know where we are heading. Do not let them

03:14:04.822 --> 03:14:12.058
know the plan. But let them know that if there are
forces to gather, they are gathering in that

03:14:12.058 --> 03:14:13.315
direction.

03:14:13.315 --> 03:14:21.177
SAM: And don't share our carefully crafted plan
with anyone. The details are so precise and exact!

03:14:21.177 --> 03:14:23.111
You must keep them secret.

03:14:23.111 --> 03:14:26.932
TALIESIN: The more precise details you have in a
war plan, the more things that will inevitably go

03:14:26.932 --> 03:14:28.501
wrong in the first ten seconds.

03:14:28.501 --> 03:14:34.910
SAM: Hey, how about we go to Daxio, and then you
guys can catch up? The airship arrives in a couple

03:14:34.910 --> 03:14:36.280
of days.

03:14:36.280 --> 03:14:38.278
MATT: "We'll do that. And then we're meeting you
at Daxio, correct?"

03:14:38.278 --> 03:14:42.650
TRAVIS: Yeah. (chants) Dax-i-o. Dax-i-o.

03:14:42.650 --> 03:14:46.381
TALIESIN: (chants) Dax-i-o. Daxio!

03:14:46.381 --> 03:14:49.945
MATT: "Very well. Daxio it is. We'll see you
soon."

03:14:49.945 --> 03:14:51.951
SAM: On the morrow.

03:14:51.951 --> 03:14:54.045
TALIESIN: No, we plan.

03:14:54.045 --> 03:14:55.187
SAM: Be pleased.

03:14:55.187 --> 03:14:56.570
LIAM and LAURA: Beep beep.

03:14:56.570 --> 03:14:58.919
MATT: Beep beep. Bidet.

03:14:58.919 --> 03:15:00.573
MARISHA: Bidet. (laughter)

03:15:00.573 --> 03:15:03.135
MATT: And with that, we'll finish the night's
session, picking up here for next week.

03:15:03.135 --> 03:15:05.896
MARISHA: We're finishing it now?

03:15:05.896 --> 03:15:07.515
MATT: Well, yeah. It's 10:30.

03:15:07.515 --> 03:15:08.996
TRAVIS: What was under that blanket?

03:15:08.996 --> 03:15:11.092
MATT: I don't know. You'll find out, I guess.

03:15:11.092 --> 03:15:14.134
LIAM: Dumbfuck ending.

03:15:14.181 --> 03:15:18.426
MARISHA: Sorry, guys.

03:15:18.426 --> 03:15:21.203
TALIESIN: I tried to stab a dragon. I swear, I
tried.

03:15:21.203 --> 03:15:22.880
TRAVIS: No, we know you did.

03:15:22.880 --> 03:15:26.650
TALIESIN: I tried to end the game. I thought the
game could totally have been ended right there.

03:15:26.650 --> 03:15:33.091
LIAM: You've got that gunslinger sneak attack
times ten damage against a green dragon.

03:15:33.091 --> 03:15:35.520
TALIESIN: Man, I did the math on what that could
have done.

03:15:35.520 --> 03:15:39.695
MATT: It could have been nasty, had it been a less
tricksy dragon, maybe.

03:15:39.695 --> 03:15:41.831
TALIESIN: Had it been a less tricksy dragon, that
would have been...

03:15:41.831 --> 03:15:45.564
LIAM: Matt, you've got a little something right--

03:15:45.564 --> 03:15:48.592
MATT: (as Victor) There? Here?

03:15:48.592 --> 03:15:51.606
LAURA: Right there.

03:15:51.606 --> 03:15:53.107
LIAM and LAURA: You got it.

03:15:53.107 --> 03:15:57.783
(laughter)

03:15:57.783 --> 03:15:59.766
MATT: (as Victor) I get to enjoy this for a little
bit, at least.

03:15:59.766 --> 03:16:02.405
TRAVIS: We should have him walk down the street
and take bets on how long it takes him to get

03:16:02.405 --> 03:16:03.351
arrested.

03:16:03.351 --> 03:16:05.561
(laughter)

03:16:05.561 --> 03:16:08.384
LIAM: Just put him on Melrose.

03:16:08.384 --> 03:16:14.756
MARISHA: Those YouTube videos of social
experiments? Just send out Matt.

03:16:14.756 --> 03:16:18.880
MATT: (as Victor) Two cheeseburgers. Couple of
fry.

03:16:18.880 --> 03:16:20.233
TALIESIN: Filet of fish!

03:16:20.233 --> 03:16:28.956
MATT: (as Victor) Filet of fish! (normal voice)
Oh, man. All right. We'll be back next week. For

03:16:28.956 --> 03:16:34.089
whatever the hell your final plan is going to be
for this.

03:16:34.089 --> 03:16:38.144
TALIESIN: This is a great plan. I am behind this
plan 100%.

03:16:38.144 --> 03:16:41.206
MATT: I am so excited.

03:16:41.206 --> 03:16:44.987
TRAVIS and MATT: Thank you, Loot Crate.

03:16:44.987 --> 03:16:47.510
SAM: Come on, Loot Crate.

03:16:47.510 --> 03:16:54.810
MATT: I'm excited for the countdown to Thordak
that we're now embarking on.

03:16:54.810 --> 03:16:58.980
TALIESIN: Maybe there will be time to run to the
Fire Plane really quick.

03:16:58.980 --> 03:17:04.371
MARISHA: I was going to say, sorry for being a
pain in the ass. It takes a lot for me to

03:17:04.371 --> 03:17:08.119
sacrifice all my people when a fourth of us have
already been sacrificed.

03:17:08.119 --> 03:17:11.099
TALIESIN: We'll go to the Fire Plane and get them
and we'll pick up an object and we'll fight a

03:17:11.099 --> 03:17:12.679
dragon. It will be great.

03:17:12.679 --> 03:17:15.596
TRAVIS: It's cool. I have an internal timer, and
if you don't meet it, I'm going to kill all your

03:17:15.596 --> 03:17:16.702
people.

03:17:16.702 --> 03:17:18.389
(laughter)

03:17:18.389 --> 03:17:20.678
TALIESIN: The glasses make that weirdly
threatening.

03:17:20.678 --> 03:17:27.009
LIAM: (singing) It's Sergeant Pepper's Lonely
Heart Club Band.

03:17:27.009 --> 03:17:29.675
MARISHA: New at Sundance!

03:17:29.675 --> 03:17:34.829
MATT: Cool, guys. Thank you so much. Everyone
looks awesome. Happy Halloween, everyone!

03:17:34.829 --> 03:17:36.151
ALL: Happy Halloween!

03:17:36.151 --> 03:17:39.165
SAM: Hashtag Critical Costumes!

03:17:39.165 --> 03:17:41.171
TALIESIN: Get candy from strangers.

03:17:41.171 --> 03:17:43.785
MARISHA: Yeah, go knock on strangers' doors and
get candy from them.

03:17:43.785 --> 03:17:48.481
TALIESIN: Do it! It's good for America. Eat candy
from strangers.

03:17:48.481 --> 03:17:51.932
MARISHA: Totally inflated.

03:17:51.932 --> 03:17:56.995
MATT: Rest well. We'll see you next week. (as
Victor) Is it Thursday yet?

03:17:56.995 --> 03:24:38.981
