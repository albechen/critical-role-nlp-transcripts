00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.045
MATT: Hello, everyone, and welcome to tonight's
episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us

00:00:03.045 --> 00:00:07.543
nerdy-ass voice actors play Dungeons and Dragons.
I think this is our 24th episode, which is

00:00:07.543 --> 00:00:13.926
ridiculous. We've been doing this since March, and
it gets more and more ridiculous every week. Glad

00:00:13.926 --> 00:00:17.826
you guys can join us. The new guys, welcome to our
chaos. For all the old folks, glad you could come

00:00:17.826 --> 00:00:23.381
and join us again. Quick thing I want to mention:
last week we were talking about the changes to

00:00:23.381 --> 00:00:30.279
Critmas, because we had stresses on scheduling and
we had crew here, and when things go long, we were

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:36.588
talking about possibly moving to Periscope on a
different day, separate medium. Well, the fanbase has

00:00:36.626 --> 00:00:43.729
spoken very loudly and very intently about their
reaction to that, and so what we're doing, to still

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:48.395
make it so people aren't kept here for ridiculous
hours weekly, we're still going to have

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:51.760
Critmas on the stream, but it's going to be once a
month. It's probably going to be the first

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.249
Thursday of every month, and we're going to make
it an extensive day for that month where we open

00:00:56.249 --> 00:01:01.932
everything that evening. We still get to
experience and share that with you guys, but also

00:01:01.932 --> 00:01:06.277
not keep these guys here way too late unpaid every
Thursday night. So I think that's the plan we're

00:01:06.277 --> 00:01:10.731
going with forward. Hopefully, that's cool with
everyone, because we love it, too, and we want to

00:01:10.731 --> 00:01:14.087
make sure we still share that with you guys.

00:01:14.087 --> 00:01:18.739
All right, couple of other announcements. First
and foremost, I wanted to mention again-- we

00:01:18.739 --> 00:01:24.176
mentioned it last week, as well-- there's that Hasbro
game design contest, design the next party game.

00:01:24.176 --> 00:01:30.562
That's still up until end of this month, I
believe. So if you want to check it out, you can

00:01:30.562 --> 00:01:35.110
go ahead and tweet at me, last week's episode or search
for the Hasbro game design contest. That's still

00:01:35.209 --> 00:01:42.972
happening. Also, there's a film series that I'm a
part of called Mythica. It's like a high fantasy

00:01:42.972 --> 00:01:49.356
film series where I play the main villain, the
necromancer Zorloc. It's fun times. It's like

00:01:49.356 --> 00:01:55.955
awesome, fun, fantasy genre film. And they're
currently putting up a Kickstarter to finish the

00:01:55.955 --> 00:02:00.656
post on the third film, so you should check that
out. Search Mythica on Kickstarter and you should

00:02:00.656 --> 00:02:07.370
find it there. Also, WeLoveFine is still running
their DND t-shirt contest for their Rage of Demons

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:11.645
release for Wizards of the Coast, where you can
submit your own t-shirt designs that fit within

00:02:11.645 --> 00:02:17.066
the Rage of Demons theme. I am one of the judges
on that, so if you submit your art to this, there

00:02:17.066 --> 00:02:23.784
is a cash prize. All the rules are up there on the
WeLoveFine contest site. And I'll be able to judge

00:02:23.784 --> 00:02:27.909
your artwork and hopefully put you through to the
end. So there's that. Trying to get through these

00:02:27.909 --> 00:02:34.389
as fast as possible. Our TeeSpring shirt for Is It
Thursday Yet? is still up. It has one more

00:02:34.389 --> 00:02:38.956
week. So if any of you guys want to get the
limited edition Critical Role Is It Thursday Yet?

00:02:38.956 --> 00:02:46.144
shirt, that is only available for one more week
and then it'll be gone forever, so get it while

00:02:46.144 --> 00:02:56.470
you can. Let's see. I'm doing my best to get
through this as fast as possible. No worries. Not

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:09.214
everything. Also, Ashley's show Blindspot is
premiering this coming Monday.

00:03:09.214 --> 00:03:12.332
(cheering)

00:03:12.332 --> 00:03:16.564
MATT: Which is so exciting. You can check out
Ashley on Blindspot where she'll maybe be sneaking

00:03:16.564 --> 00:03:22.533
Critical Role stuff into the show, hopefully.
We're trying to push her to do that. So you should go

00:03:22.533 --> 00:03:27.941
support her. See it. It's awesome. And all of us
lament that's the reason she's away from us.

00:03:27.941 --> 00:03:33.575
Someone want to handle our other cool--

00:03:33.624 --> 00:03:39.669
LAURA: But it's not on us yet. Oh look, now you
can see us.

00:03:39.669 --> 00:03:48.898
LIAM: Why don't I go, and then you can go. Hey,
you guys. I just want to make sure all of you are

00:03:48.898 --> 00:03:53.906
aware-- this is going to be so awkward-- I want to
make sure you're all aware of a Kickstarter that's

00:03:53.906 --> 00:03:59.078
out there that is put up by a good friend of mine
named Joe Madureira. Now if you don't know who Joe

00:03:59.078 --> 00:04:06.773
is, he is a comic book rock god and a game
developer. When I was a teenager, he made a comic

00:04:06.773 --> 00:04:12.836
book called Battle Chasers. Look, here's mine. From
when I was 16, Joe. I fell in love with it. Nobody

00:04:12.836 --> 00:04:18.932
does art like Joe Mad does, and I've followed his
art for years and years. Even when I fell out of

00:04:18.932 --> 00:04:24.372
comic books, I was checking in with Hellboy and I
was checking in with Joe Mad. And then, years

00:04:24.372 --> 00:04:29.093
later, I got cast in a game called Darksiders as
one of the Horsemen of the Apocalypse. I played

00:04:29.093 --> 00:04:34.157
War, and I walked into the room and Joe Mad was in
the fucking room, and then we became friends. So

00:04:34.157 --> 00:04:39.655
that game was amazing. Darksiders is a beautiful
game. It just reeked of Joe's art style and now he

00:04:39.655 --> 00:04:46.807
has formed another company called Airship Syndicate
and they have a Kickstarter up. They are making a

00:04:46.807 --> 00:04:54.025
game called Battle Chasers. Oh shoot! I didn't put
the thing that comes-- oh, Nightwar! Battle

00:04:54.025 --> 00:04:59.803
Chasers: Nightwar. They've already hit their goal,
but there are stretch goals. They are making an

00:04:59.803 --> 00:05:06.657
RPG, sort of in the ilk of JRPGs, like Final
Fantasy and Chrono Trigger. And it's just going to

00:05:06.657 --> 00:05:16.096
be bathed in the glory of Joe Mad's amazing art
style. So they've hit their goal, but the bigger

00:05:16.096 --> 00:05:20.810
the budget, the better the game is going to be. I
backed it already. And you guys should at least go

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:23.566
check it out. A lot of love for Joe Mad.

00:05:23.566 --> 00:05:29.659
ORION: Yeah, me too. I'm on the same end. I knew
Joe Mad through meeting Liam for a while, and

00:05:29.659 --> 00:05:38.695
later realizing that this guy I knew as an amazing
voice director and an amazing producer has inked

00:05:38.695 --> 00:05:46.708
some of my favorite issues of Excalibur, and I
crapped my pants. I have four of yours, Joe, in my

00:05:46.708 --> 00:05:52.439
box right now at home. He's an amazing guy and
awesome thing to back. Check it out, please.

00:05:52.439 --> 00:05:56.251
LIAM: And one, the main character from Battle
Chasers kind of looks like Pike!

00:05:56.251 --> 00:05:58.376
LAURA: She does! I thought that, too.

00:05:58.376 --> 00:06:01.105
MATT: That's sweet. Wunderbar!

00:06:01.105 --> 00:06:11.765
TALIESIN: I got something. Next weekend, September
26 and 27, I'm going to be at a con!

00:06:11.765 --> 00:06:13.933
In Anchorage, Alaska.

00:06:13.933 --> 00:06:16.522
ORION: That means "convention".

00:06:16.522 --> 00:06:24.271
TALIESIN: That means moose. I'm so excited. Senshi
Con in Anchorage. I'll be there. I know we at

00:06:24.271 --> 00:06:35.475
least have, like, three fans at the very least in
Alaska. Come on by. I'd

00:06:35.475 --> 00:06:37.756
love to see you. It'll be awesome.

00:06:37.756 --> 00:06:39.901
MATT: Fantastic. Speaking of conventions, guys.

00:06:39.946 --> 00:06:43.514
MARISHA: Oh man, drop it like it's hot.

00:06:43.514 --> 00:06:49.030
MATT: For those of you upper East Coast folks,
we've recently been able to announce that we will

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:57.776
be at and running some events at New York Comic
Con in October. All of us, the entire Critical

00:06:57.776 --> 00:07:02.573
Role team will be at Comic Con. We're going to
have signing, panel and all kinds of fun stuff

00:07:02.573 --> 00:07:06.538
throughout the weekend. And we'll be there. And if
you're in the area, or if it's drivable, or even

00:07:06.538 --> 00:07:09.232
if it's not, you should come anyway, cause we'd
like to see you.

00:07:09.232 --> 00:07:11.024
If it's trainable, if it's flyable.

00:07:11.024 --> 00:07:14.795
TRAVIS: If you steal a horse, steal a horse and
ride it.

00:07:14.795 --> 00:07:17.843
LAURA: If you want to ride a bear there, I
wouldn't judge you.

00:07:17.843 --> 00:07:20.768
MARISHA: And what weekend is New York Comic Con?

00:07:20.768 --> 00:07:24.740
LIAM: Eight, nine, ten, 11.

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:29.627
MARISHA: October 8th, 9th, 10th and 11th. So
you've got three weeks to prepare.

00:07:29.627 --> 00:07:33.759
MATT: Yeah, so excited to be there. Excited to see
you there. And it'll be a lot of fun.

00:07:33.759 --> 00:07:34.773
A lot of fun.

00:07:34.773 --> 00:07:38.285
LIAM: Primarily doing stuff Saturday that we know.
We're waiting to see what's

00:07:38.285 --> 00:07:39.887
going on Sunday weekend.

00:07:39.887 --> 00:07:41.261
LAURA: Saturday is for sure.

00:07:41.261 --> 00:07:44.452
TALIESIN: With more of us than are even here.

00:07:44.452 --> 00:07:46.323
TRAVIS: Bring your swag. Bring your friends.

00:07:46.357 --> 00:07:52.315
MARISHA: Not even all of us were at San Diego.
Well, we were all there, just not all at one point

00:07:52.315 --> 00:07:53.756
at one time.

00:07:53.756 --> 00:07:55.436
TRAVIS: Because we were missing Sam.

00:07:55.436 --> 00:08:01.282
MATT: The first full Critical Role con appearance.
Boom.

00:08:01.282 --> 00:08:03.103
TRAVIS: The unicorn appears.

00:08:03.103 --> 00:08:05.742
ORION: I'm going to get a hot dog.

00:08:05.742 --> 00:08:15.625
MATT: Orion's going to get a hot dog. Awesome. Any
other announcements?

00:08:15.625 --> 00:08:17.773
Or did you have something, you said?

00:08:17.773 --> 00:08:20.457
LAURA: No, I was just so excited about New York
Comic Con,

00:08:20.457 --> 00:08:22.768
I wanted to be a part of that announcement.

00:08:22.768 --> 00:08:26.562
ORION: I would like to announce that I feel pretty
good.

00:08:26.562 --> 00:08:29.740
TALIESIN: I'm terrified, personally, but--

00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:32.779
ORION: I know, but maybe that's why I feel so
good.

00:08:32.779 --> 00:08:35.516
TALIESIN: You were right. It is awful.

00:08:35.516 --> 00:08:38.368
ORION: I'll get shunned for it happening, then I'm
like, oh, cool.

00:08:38.368 --> 00:08:39.901
I don't have to worry about me right now.

00:08:39.901 --> 00:08:41.447
MARISHA: So much pressure.

00:08:41.447 --> 00:08:43.875
LAURA: Should we say that we have Kit here?

00:08:43.875 --> 00:08:48.974
TALIESIN: No, we shouldn't tell them that we have
Kit here. Let's hold that back.

00:08:48.974 --> 00:08:50.823
MATT: Kit Buss is not here.

00:08:50.823 --> 00:08:55.064
MARISHA: We also have both of our artists
here.

00:08:55.064 --> 00:08:56.690
LAURA: Kit and Wendy.

00:08:56.690 --> 00:08:58.805
MATT: Kit and Wendy.

00:08:58.805 --> 00:09:04.272
MARISHA: Kit and Wendy. Come here! But come here!

00:09:04.272 --> 00:09:07.257
RYAN: There's a 30-second lag.

00:09:07.398 --> 00:09:11.774
MATT: We'll eventually have them say hello to
everyone, but Kit Buss, our official CritRole

00:09:11.774 --> 00:09:17.027
artist who did all the original character designs, 
continues to produce amazing art for this show, is here

00:09:17.027 --> 00:09:20.962
visiting Los Angeles for the next week. So she's
here on the set and we'll drag her out in front of

00:09:20.962 --> 00:09:23.336
the camera and embarrass her shortly.

00:09:23.336 --> 00:09:26.216
TALIESIN: I've been curious precisely how long the
lag is, because--

00:09:26.216 --> 00:09:28.114
LAURA: It's about 30 seconds.

00:09:28.114 --> 00:09:30.174
MARISHA: We learned when we killed the carpet.

00:09:30.174 --> 00:09:33.886
LAURA: Yeah. (muffled yelling)

00:09:33.886 --> 00:09:36.651
MARISHA: Just time that. Time that.

00:09:36.651 --> 00:09:40.585
MATT: I guess also an announcement for all you
League players out there: awesome character just

00:09:40.585 --> 00:09:46.816
got announced called Kindred. Kind of a two-part
thing. That wolf that's the part of Kindred

00:09:46.816 --> 00:09:50.792
sounds pretty cool so you should play it.

00:09:50.792 --> 00:09:52.838
TRAVIS: I heard that. It's subtle.

00:09:52.838 --> 00:09:56.988
MATT: Real subtle. It's a good one. I think that's
it, isn't it? I think we're good on announcements,

00:09:56.988 --> 00:09:58.721
and we can start.

00:09:58.721 --> 00:10:01.385
TALIESIN: I feel like we have, do we have an
address? Address?

00:10:01.385 --> 00:10:02.960
MATT: Oh, the PO Box?

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:04.350
TALIESIN: Do we have that?

00:10:04.350 --> 00:10:06.854
TRAVIS: It's up. Yeah, he's got it.

00:10:06.854 --> 00:10:08.420
TALIESIN: It's up and in the chat?

00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:10.140
RYAN: The mods are posting it in the chat.

00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:15.791
MATT: The mods got that covered. Now diverting all
Critmas images and the boxes, and we have arrived.

00:10:15.791 --> 00:10:19.421
Our nefarious Scanlan--

00:10:19.421 --> 00:10:21.289
SAM: Whoa. Were you just talking about me?

00:10:21.289 --> 00:10:22.347
MATT: Yeah!

00:10:22.347 --> 00:10:25.715
SAM: Whoa, that's crazy. I was just talking about
me, too.

00:10:25.715 --> 00:10:28.817
MATT: As was the website, because your interview
went up today.

00:10:28.817 --> 00:10:36.650
SAM: Oh, that's right. I saw. Some of that I had my
ghostwriter write for me. I have a biographer and

00:10:36.650 --> 00:10:37.966
a ghostwriter.

00:10:37.966 --> 00:10:41.269
TRAVIS: Is that a ghostwriter on retainer that we
can also use?

00:10:41.269 --> 00:10:42.883
SAM: Yeah, sure.

00:10:42.883 --> 00:10:46.565
MATT: Good to know. Well, fantastic. Do you have
any announcements you want to make,

00:10:46.565 --> 00:10:48.107
Sam, or shall we jump in?

00:10:48.249 --> 00:10:51.852
SAM: No. Just that I don't have any dice but I can
use Orion's and they're going to be awesome.

00:10:51.852 --> 00:10:56.692
LAURA: I have so many dice. Take this giant bag
and just fish some out.

00:10:56.692 --> 00:10:58.017
SAM: Great. Thanks.

00:10:58.017 --> 00:10:59.758
TALIESIN: The Bag of Disagreeable Dice.

00:10:59.758 --> 00:11:01.915
LAURA: No, let him find them.

00:11:01.915 --> 00:11:12.127
MATT: All righty, then in just a minute, let us
begin this next episode of Critical Role.

00:11:12.127 --> 00:12:20.463
[dramatic music]

00:12:20.463 --> 00:12:24.351
MATT: Welcome back. All right, so to give you guys
a little heads-up of what has recently transpired in

00:12:24.351 --> 00:12:29.254
the story. The party, after completing their
business in the city of Vasselheim, on the far-off

00:12:29.254 --> 00:12:37.082
northwest continent. Grog, of course, having an
epic battle in the Crucible fight pit against

00:12:37.082 --> 00:12:38.547
Kern, reclaiming his honor.

00:12:38.547 --> 00:12:42.443
TRAVIS: (singing) I am the champion, my friends.

00:12:42.443 --> 00:12:50.215
MATT: Pike left back there to finish up the renovation of
the temple of Sarenrae that was discovered. The

00:12:50.215 --> 00:12:54.999
rest of the party moved on back to Emon, the rest
of their business complete. Within Emon, they

00:12:54.999 --> 00:13:02.352
returned to Greyskull Keep, where they encountered a
fan, apparently, of Vox Machina, that had been

00:13:02.352 --> 00:13:08.616
camping for two weeks outside, who was promptly
bludgeoned in the temple by Vax to teach him a

00:13:08.616 --> 00:13:18.938
lesson. Brought back from the brink, and taught
that hard lesson-- that this is a dangerous

00:13:18.938 --> 00:13:24.975
field-- managed to seemingly reach out and touch
the heart of this young, intrepid, wannabe

00:13:24.975 --> 00:13:28.895
adventurer to possibly try and better himself before he
throws himself into danger's way. And he

00:13:28.895 --> 00:13:31.091
ran off to train harder.

00:13:31.154 --> 00:13:32.507
TALIESIN: Dagger, dagger, hug.

00:13:32.507 --> 00:13:38.361
MATT: Indeed. Upon returning to the keep, notice
was sent off to one of the other members of the

00:13:38.361 --> 00:13:47.807
Council of Tal'Dorei, Seeker Asum, who is the halfling
head of whispers and all sorts of subterfuge

00:13:47.858 --> 00:13:57.045
across the countryside, who came to you notifying
you that within a week's time, the Briarwoods, Lord and

00:13:57.045 --> 00:14:02.485
Lady Briarwood, are supposed to be arriving here
within Emon for a feast to discuss building a

00:14:02.485 --> 00:14:10.723
bridge and a more political joining between Emon,
the Tal'Dorei royal family, and these

00:14:10.723 --> 00:14:20.937
up-and-coming lords and ladies, who have a very
dark history with Percy's character. You've been

00:14:20.937 --> 00:14:25.088
asked to join as part of this feast as you
previously requested with sovereign Tal'Dorei, that

00:14:25.088 --> 00:14:28.629
should anything involved the Briarwoods that you
be included. You have a week to figure out what

00:14:28.629 --> 00:14:31.859
you want to do in advance of that. And that is
where we left off.

00:14:31.859 --> 00:14:34.312
ORION: What time of the day is it?

00:14:34.312 --> 00:14:39.155
MATT: Right now, after this discussion, you guys'
arrival, I'd say it's probably mid-afternoon.

00:14:39.155 --> 00:14:46.299
First things first, though, after this discussion
with Seeker Asum, who leaves the keep, you do have

00:14:46.299 --> 00:14:54.321
a brief moment of awkward silence as most of the
people that work within your keep turn to you.

00:14:54.321 --> 00:15:02.885
Laina looks about the rest of you and goes, "By
the way, we've been working here for about six

00:15:02.885 --> 00:15:10.348
"weeks on the pay of four. We're coming close to
our next pay scheme, and you tend to leave

00:15:10.348 --> 00:15:17.651
"often and for extended periods of time. We would
also like to be paid, if possible."

00:15:17.651 --> 00:15:27.409
LAURA: Most definitely, dear. Yes. We are definitely
going to pay you. Does anybody remember how much we

00:15:27.409 --> 00:15:29.413
are supposed to pay them?

00:15:29.413 --> 00:15:31.784
ORION: Pardon, what is the total of the staff's
payment?

00:15:31.784 --> 00:15:38.254
MATT: She thinks to herself for a moment, at which
point you see Erwen, the elderly servant in the

00:15:38.254 --> 00:15:45.327
back says, "Actually, you had previously said it
was both of our services was 50 gold each for the

00:15:45.327 --> 00:15:52.217
"month. And if I recall, the other mercenaries or
guardians that you've hired to watch the walls of

00:15:52.217 --> 00:15:58.174
"the keep were at a discussed 100 gold for the
month's wages. Each."

00:15:58.174 --> 00:16:00.277
LAURA: And how many of those guys do we have?

00:16:00.277 --> 00:16:08.205
MATT: "You currently have five on your payroll,
yes. 600 gold pieces total per month for the

00:16:08.205 --> 00:16:10.272
"services for everyone keeping your keep."

00:16:10.272 --> 00:16:16.847
LAURA: Tell you what, I will front this from my
personal funds for this month. Just because we

00:16:16.847 --> 00:16:20.151
don't have enough in the party funds to cover
that.

00:16:20.151 --> 00:16:21.721
SAM: We don't have 600 gold?

00:16:21.721 --> 00:16:22.580
LAURA: We do not!

00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:23.698
SAM: Who's our treasurer?!

00:16:23.698 --> 00:16:26.340
LAURA: I am, but you bitches keep spending money!

00:16:26.340 --> 00:16:29.623
LIAM: I'll go halfsies.

00:16:29.623 --> 00:16:34.743
LAURA: Halfsies? Lovely. Twinsies will pay
halfsies. Here you go! 300 for each.

00:16:34.743 --> 00:16:37.961
MATT: "Thank you so much. I'll make sure this gets
to the appropriate individuals immediately.

00:16:37.961 --> 00:16:40.427
"They'll be very happy to not have to walk away. "

00:16:40.427 --> 00:16:45.451
LAURA: Yes, don't worry, you will always be paid
from Vox Machina.

00:16:45.451 --> 00:16:52.961
MATT: Erwen steps in. "And by the way, if you do
intend to leave for an extended period of time

00:16:52.961 --> 00:16:59.208
"again, I would recommend perhaps paying that in
advance. There was a bit of unrest last time."

00:16:59.208 --> 00:17:00.958
SAM: Should we pay another month?

00:17:00.958 --> 00:17:02.537
LAURA: Not yet. Not just yet.

00:17:02.537 --> 00:17:07.457
ORION: I'll pay him in advance right now, just to
get it out of the way. 600, out of here, phew,

00:17:07.457 --> 00:17:08.793
there you go.

00:17:08.793 --> 00:17:12.485
MATT: "Very well, sire! I shall disseminate this
amongst the others."

00:17:12.485 --> 00:17:16.656
TALIESIN: Traditionally, the head of the house
does dispense out the stipends anyway. That would

00:17:16.656 --> 00:17:19.934
be appropriate. I'm not even in the room, am I?
Never mind! Sorry.

00:17:19.934 --> 00:17:22.543
MATT: Yeah, you're down in the workshop.

00:17:22.543 --> 00:17:24.363
LAURA: Can I go find Percy?

00:17:24.363 --> 00:17:25.579
MATT: You can.

00:17:25.579 --> 00:17:28.910
MARISHA: Actually, we should all go find Percy. We
should all talk to Percy.

00:17:28.910 --> 00:17:32.276
MATT: "Thank you kindly, Tiberius. Thank you." And
he wanders off and begins counting out change into

00:17:32.276 --> 00:17:34.952
a smaller purse.

00:17:34.952 --> 00:17:40.695
ORION: When they start to go, I'd like to go to
the temple with the sigils and talk to the guy who

00:17:40.695 --> 00:17:41.899
runs the place.

00:17:41.899 --> 00:17:45.775
MATT: Oh, you mean the Lyceum?

00:17:45.775 --> 00:17:46.872
ORION: Yeah.

00:17:46.872 --> 00:17:48.500
MATT: Okay, the Alabaster Lyceum.

00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:55.855
ORION: Yeah, because I learned something new this
week and I was like, I'm dumb. But that's where I

00:17:55.855 --> 00:17:57.126
would like to head.

00:17:57.126 --> 00:18:01.406
MATT: All right. So you make your way towards the
Alabaster Lyceum. The rest of you head down into

00:18:01.406 --> 00:18:07.031
Percy's workshop. So you head around the outskirts of the
inner portion of the keep itself, down the

00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:12.801
stairway that leads to the basement floor, which
contains a small cell, like a holding cell that

00:18:12.801 --> 00:18:17.438
you had constructed for you in case you had
somebody to take prisoner at some point. To the right.

00:18:17.438 --> 00:18:22.220
To the left of you, there's a small turning
hallway that leads to the workshop. The workshop

00:18:22.220 --> 00:18:32.099
contains a series of various tools, workbenches.
It actually has a working forge, with anvil and

00:18:32.099 --> 00:18:35.884
various blacksmithing tools. And as you guys come
down, the heat is already blasting from it, and

00:18:35.884 --> 00:18:39.762
you can see Percy madly diving into work of some
kind.

00:18:39.762 --> 00:18:47.407
TRAVIS: What are you doing, Percy? You making more
mousetraps? Guess not.

00:18:47.407 --> 00:18:53.032
TALIESIN: I'm a bit busy. I am making more ammo.
I'm working on a few projects that have been

00:18:53.032 --> 00:18:55.540
rolling around in my head for quite some time
now.

00:18:55.540 --> 00:18:57.628
ORION: (whispers) Don't forget the bolt.

00:18:57.628 --> 00:18:59.417
TALIESIN: The bolt is on the list, yes.

00:18:59.417 --> 00:19:00.707
LAURA: Quite the worker.

00:19:00.707 --> 00:19:02.270
TALIESIN: I've got a lot to do.

00:19:02.270 --> 00:19:06.846
LAURA: Yes. Darling...

00:19:06.846 --> 00:19:09.774
TALIESIN: How many of you are down here right
now?

00:19:09.774 --> 00:19:13.632
TRAVIS: I think we're all here. I'm moving through
his stuff.

00:19:13.632 --> 00:19:16.943
LAURA: I let Trinket forage around the courtyard,
so he's not down here at the moment.

00:19:16.943 --> 00:19:19.524
LIAM: I think we need a little history lesson
here--

00:19:19.524 --> 00:19:20.754
TALIESIN: Grog, don't touch that!

00:19:20.754 --> 00:19:22.159
TRAVIS: Why not? But it moves!

00:19:22.159 --> 00:19:24.447
LAURA: Don't touch anything.

00:19:24.447 --> 00:19:28.494
ORION: Matthew, I took some fine meats before I
left and I'm feeding them to

00:19:28.494 --> 00:19:29.895
Lockheed along the way.

00:19:29.895 --> 00:19:34.845
MATT: Okay. Lockheed enjoys them thoroughly.
They're delicious. Comfort food crafted by the

00:19:34.845 --> 00:19:37.059
finest of cooks in Greyskull Keep.

00:19:37.059 --> 00:19:43.891
MARISHA: Percy, it's hard not to clearly notice
that you're quite distressed, and we're concerned.

00:19:43.891 --> 00:19:49.983
And you know, we were talking about it-- not that
we were talking about you or anything, behind your

00:19:49.983 --> 00:19:55.530
back or anything-- but we never really found out
why you were in that

00:19:55.530 --> 00:19:58.969
prison cell when we found you.

00:19:58.969 --> 00:20:02.948
LIAM: We've never questioned it before. We've
never wanted to make you uncomfortable. But we're

00:20:02.948 --> 00:20:10.045
about to walk into a party, and I feel like we
need a bit of a history lesson.

00:20:10.045 --> 00:20:18.532
TALIESIN: Ugh. I know you're right. (sighs)

00:20:18.532 --> 00:20:22.375
TRAVIS: Should we guess? Was it public nudity?

00:20:22.375 --> 00:20:29.300
TALIESIN: A bit. I've never had to say this out
loud before. I've never actually had this

00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:30.813
discussion with anyone.

00:20:30.813 --> 00:20:35.226
SAM: It's okay. It gets better.

00:20:35.226 --> 00:20:39.032
TALIESIN: Do I get an inspiration die for that?

00:20:39.032 --> 00:20:41.013
MATT: I'll give you a d6 inspiration die.

00:20:41.013 --> 00:20:44.994
(laughter)

00:20:44.994 --> 00:20:55.802
TALIESIN: The Briarwoods, Lord and Lady Briarwood,
are responsible for the death of my entire family.

00:20:55.802 --> 00:21:06.844
Whitestone was my home. Many years ago-- I don't
want to get into the details. I came from a big

00:21:06.844 --> 00:21:18.540
family. I came from a proud family. One night,
they were invited into our home, and over the

00:21:18.540 --> 00:21:27.931
course of that night, they slaughtered everybody.
They are evil. They are corrupting. The few

00:21:27.931 --> 00:21:37.964
survivors of Castle Whitestone who did survive
only survived through deceit and by working for

00:21:37.964 --> 00:21:46.477
the Briarwoods, turning on their masters.
Thankfully, the de Rolo family still has standing

00:21:46.477 --> 00:21:55.522
elsewhere, and there's other branches of the
family other than my father's. (sighs) I was lost

00:21:55.522 --> 00:22:01.046
for quite a while after that happened. I had
nothing else in my life other than my family. I

00:22:01.046 --> 00:22:15.683
was never really going to inherit anything. I was
not going to run anything. I was idle. And at some

00:22:15.683 --> 00:22:26.410
point, I made the decision that, if nothing else,
I survived to, maybe, extract some vengeance.

00:22:26.410 --> 00:22:37.924
Maybe set something right. Maybe stop whatever it
was that they were doing. I don't know. There was

00:22:37.924 --> 00:22:47.648
one of their party, Dr. Ripley. She was in charge
of something during the murder. I don't know what.

00:22:47.648 --> 00:23:03.286
I chased her. I chased her down. It took a year,
and I had my gun, and I discovered where she was

00:23:03.286 --> 00:23:14.585
and where she was working on some ruins, and I
approached her. I never even saw her face. Her

00:23:14.585 --> 00:23:21.533
guards captured me, beat me up. Didn't even bother
taking my things. They just threw me in that

00:23:21.533 --> 00:23:27.533
dungeon. I never even got close enough to see her
face.

00:23:27.533 --> 00:23:29.596
SAM: You know her name, but you've never seen her
before?

00:23:29.596 --> 00:23:34.159
TALIESIN: I saw her when she was interrogating me
in my home.

00:23:34.159 --> 00:23:35.888
SAM: Oh, so you could recognize her.

00:23:35.888 --> 00:23:36.989
TALIESIN: Oh yes.

00:23:36.989 --> 00:23:41.715
LAURA: How did you get away when they-- with the
rest of your family?

00:23:41.715 --> 00:23:57.894
TALIESIN: My sister Cassandra, my younger sister.
She somehow evaded capture. I don't know how. She

00:23:57.894 --> 00:24:06.289
set me free. I don't know what became of her. I
don't know what became of any of my siblings.

00:24:06.289 --> 00:24:14.196
Probably nothing reasonable. Nothing good.

00:24:14.196 --> 00:24:17.731
LIAM: You witnessed none of these deaths?

00:24:17.731 --> 00:24:23.969
TALIESIN: I saw bodies of a few of them. It's all
a bit shady. It's all a bit of a blur.

00:24:23.969 --> 00:24:26.157
SAM: How many years ago was this?

00:24:26.157 --> 00:24:30.331
TALIESIN: (sighs) Four now. Five now.

00:24:30.331 --> 00:24:35.904
LAURA: If you know that they murdered your family,
how are they still part of society?

00:24:35.904 --> 00:24:45.604
TALIESIN: I don't know. (sighs) I could have gone
home. I could have gone home at any point, at this

00:24:45.604 --> 00:24:51.652
point. I'm scared.

00:24:51.652 --> 00:24:55.206
MARISHA: Did they take over Whitestone? Are they
still there?

00:24:55.206 --> 00:25:00.703
TALIESIN: I discovered approximately a week ago
that they're still at Whitestone.

00:25:00.703 --> 00:25:02.648
LAURA: Will they recognize you?

00:25:02.648 --> 00:25:03.781
TALIESIN: I don't know.

00:25:03.781 --> 00:25:06.350
TRAVIS: And these pricks are in good standing with
the council?

00:25:06.350 --> 00:25:13.963
TALIESIN: (sighs) I don't know what to do. I'm
preparing for anything. When I got thrown into

00:25:13.963 --> 00:25:25.405
that dungeon, I came to the realization that maybe
I wasn't doing this the right way. I wasn't being

00:25:25.405 --> 00:25:35.576
responsible, and I prayed to whatever it is I pray
to that maybe I would have a sign of what I should

00:25:35.576 --> 00:25:44.789
be doing, and then there you were. I've been
trusting that Vox Machina will take me where I

00:25:44.789 --> 00:25:49.340
need to go, and maybe what I need to do is
confront this, but I don't know what this is,

00:25:49.340 --> 00:25:53.455
and I'm terrified.

00:25:53.455 --> 00:25:58.031
LIAM: And the remains of your family, were they
killed by the sword?

00:25:58.031 --> 00:26:11.390
TALIESIN: I don't know. There was an
interrogation. Dr. Ripley was asking questions. I

00:26:11.390 --> 00:26:15.911
assumed, for all these years, that that's what
became of my family.

00:26:15.911 --> 00:26:21.919
MARISHA: What was she asking questions about? What
did they want? Was it just a political coup?

00:26:21.919 --> 00:26:29.464
TALIESIN: Asking questions about the castle, about
things about the castle. It was a long time ago,

00:26:29.464 --> 00:26:35.902
and I was not equipped for torture. I don't
remember much.

00:26:35.902 --> 00:26:37.779
TRAVIS: Do you want them dead?

00:26:37.779 --> 00:26:40.335
TALIESIN: I think so.

00:26:40.335 --> 00:26:44.332
LAURA: Should we interrogate them first? Find out
more about your family?

00:26:44.332 --> 00:26:47.979
TRAVIS: Or just skip ahead to the dead part?

00:26:47.979 --> 00:26:55.502
TALIESIN: I put down my gun, and I turn the
barrel, and of the six barrels, five of them have

00:26:55.502 --> 00:27:01.651
names, and Lord and Lady Briarwood are two of
those names. Dr. Ripley is another.

00:27:01.651 --> 00:27:03.666
SAM: What are the other ones?

00:27:03.666 --> 00:27:06.477
TALIESIN: Sir Stonefell is the other, and
Professor Anders is the other, and then there's

00:27:06.477 --> 00:27:07.669
one blank one.

00:27:07.669 --> 00:27:10.933
LAURA: Are they all members of the same party?
They travel with the Briarwoods?

00:27:10.933 --> 00:27:12.349
TALIESIN: I don't know.

00:27:12.349 --> 00:27:22.116
MARISHA: Wait, what were the names? The
Briarwoods, Ripley, Sir Kerrion Stonefell.

00:27:22.116 --> 00:27:23.555
Who is he?

00:27:23.555 --> 00:27:25.800
TALIESIN: He was the captain of their guard.

00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:29.207
MARISHA: And Professor Anders? Who's that?

00:27:29.207 --> 00:27:38.358
TALIESIN: Professor Anders was my teacher. He was
my tutor, and he was in collusion with them, and

00:27:38.358 --> 00:27:44.122
he was the one that I believe allowed them to take
the castle in the night.

00:27:44.122 --> 00:27:49.934
MARISHA: And do you remember why they were invited
to Whitestone to begin with?

00:27:49.934 --> 00:27:58.014
TALIESIN: They were traveling. They were on the
road. It was my brother Julius and my sister

00:27:58.014 --> 00:28:05.981
Vesper who handled matters of court. I was
studying. I didn't think.

00:28:05.981 --> 00:28:08.888
MARISHA: And how many brothers and sisters do you
have?

00:28:08.888 --> 00:28:11.186
TALIESIN: I had six.

00:28:11.186 --> 00:28:14.857
LAURA: You might have six. We don't know what
happened to them.

00:28:14.857 --> 00:28:18.054
MARISHA: You said you saw a few bodies of family?

00:28:18.054 --> 00:28:26.799
TALIESIN: It's all very much a blur. (sighs)
There's things you just forget.

00:28:26.799 --> 00:28:35.327
SAM: Well, this is certainly tragic, but looking
forward, what do we know of this meeting? Event?

00:28:35.327 --> 00:28:37.253
Party? What are we doing?

00:28:37.253 --> 00:28:40.952
LAURA: Well, I think we need to do some spying.

00:28:40.952 --> 00:28:44.479
SAM: Well, do they know Percy's among us?

00:28:44.479 --> 00:28:46.487
LAURA: That's the thing. I don't know if they do.

00:28:46.487 --> 00:28:48.610
TALIESIN: You don't have to get involved in this.

00:28:48.610 --> 00:28:50.793
LAURA: Oh, we are so involved.

00:28:50.793 --> 00:28:54.167
TRAVIS: (laughing) Yeah, we do. You said you want
them dead.

00:28:54.167 --> 00:28:57.929
LAURA: We've got your back, darling.

00:28:58.261 --> 00:29:03.117
LIAM: Percival, you don't really have a choice in
the matter. My sister and I know a little piece of

00:29:03.117 --> 00:29:09.102
your pain. I'm not going to get into it, but
there's nothing she and I can do. We can find

00:29:09.102 --> 00:29:11.864
reparations for you. We will.

00:29:11.864 --> 00:29:14.996
MARISHA: Percy, is this what you want?

00:29:14.996 --> 00:29:17.636
TALIESIN: There's only one way to find out.

00:29:17.636 --> 00:29:19.599
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:29:19.599 --> 00:29:25.365
SAM: And if we kill them, how much will you pay
us? Just kidding. We ask other people that.

00:29:25.365 --> 00:29:37.124
LAURA: Something I do need to know. Percy. If we
see them, and we're not ready to show our faces,

00:29:37.124 --> 00:29:39.611
will you be able to contain yourself?

00:29:39.611 --> 00:29:41.955
TALIESIN: I think so.

00:29:41.955 --> 00:29:44.166
MARISHA: And would they be able to recognize your
face?

00:29:44.166 --> 00:29:48.394
TALIESIN: Which is why I was planning on-- I know
we have a cap of disguise.

00:29:48.394 --> 00:29:49.983
TRAVIS: Oh! We do.

00:29:49.983 --> 00:29:51.138
LAURA: Scanlan has it.

00:29:51.138 --> 00:29:55.369
TALIESIN: I don't even know if they would
recognize me. My hair was different.

00:29:55.369 --> 00:29:58.070
LAURA: Less purple?

00:29:58.070 --> 00:30:06.273
SAM: We could go into town, and find you a bushy
mustache. It's worked for me many times.

00:30:06.273 --> 00:30:08.893
TALIESIN: I don't think I wear one as well as you
do.

00:30:08.893 --> 00:30:11.163
LIAM: How does that cap work?

00:30:11.163 --> 00:30:18.452
SAM: Well, that cap is more of a hat. While
wearing this hat you can use an action to cast

00:30:18.452 --> 00:30:24.013
Disguise spell. Oh. Cast a Disguise spell? Do you
have to be a spellcaster to use it?

00:30:24.013 --> 00:30:25.859
MATT: You do not have to, no.

00:30:25.859 --> 00:30:27.253
SAM: Okay.

00:30:27.253 --> 00:30:31.342
TRAVIS: I see a shiny tool. I don't know what it
does.

00:30:31.342 --> 00:30:35.382
MATT: You reach over and grab it, and it's a large
set of tongs, used for gripping large, heavy

00:30:35.382 --> 00:30:39.492
pieces of metal, either for the actual forge
itself, or to bend

00:30:39.492 --> 00:30:41.850
and manipulate on the workbench.

00:30:41.850 --> 00:30:44.727
TRAVIS: I take it (yawns) and put it in the Bag of
Holding.

00:30:44.727 --> 00:30:47.343
MATT: Make a sleight of hand check.

00:30:47.343 --> 00:30:51.079
MARISHA: Stealing from the workshop that you
partially own?

00:30:51.079 --> 00:30:54.850
TRAVIS: There are lots of cool stuff in there!
What was the check?

00:30:54.850 --> 00:30:56.146
MATT: Sleight of hand.

00:30:56.146 --> 00:30:58.129
TRAVIS: Where's sleight of hand-- 17!

00:30:58.129 --> 00:31:05.511
LAURA: My passive perception is 21.

00:31:05.511 --> 00:31:10.269
TALIESIN: No, this could be funny, let this
happen.

00:31:10.269 --> 00:31:13.287
LAURA: I give him the evil eye.

00:31:13.287 --> 00:31:15.347
MATT: She gives you the evil eye.

00:31:15.347 --> 00:31:17.380
TRAVIS: It hurts. I put it back.

00:31:17.380 --> 00:31:22.270
TALIESIN: Out of curiosity, what did you pick up,
what did it look like?

00:31:22.270 --> 00:31:25.197
TRAVIS: It was a big thing of tongs. I didn't know
what it did, I just wanted it.

00:31:25.197 --> 00:31:32.535
TALIESIN: A big thing of tongs? What would I have
to roll to find out if it was covered in some

00:31:32.535 --> 00:31:43.262
basic sulfuric acid? If it was one of the things I
was using for casting.

00:31:43.262 --> 00:31:49.717
MATT: Ah, interesting. You know your tools very
well in your workshop, and yeah, the metal is

00:31:49.717 --> 00:31:52.387
scarred and pockmarked from use with the various
corrosive chemicals.

00:31:52.387 --> 00:31:55.612
TALIESIN: That'll take about ten minutes to take
effect. All right.

00:31:55.612 --> 00:31:58.734
(gasping)

00:31:58.734 --> 00:32:00.592
ORION: Stupid.

00:32:00.592 --> 00:32:04.838
LAURA: You're not there.

00:32:04.838 --> 00:32:10.194
SAM: Well this Hat of Disguise, Percival, it
requires some attunement. I don't know how capable

00:32:10.194 --> 00:32:12.332
you are with magical items.

00:32:12.332 --> 00:32:15.877
TALIESIN: I can find out.

00:32:15.877 --> 00:32:22.238
LIAM: We got seven days. I can make you look like
anything. I can talk to the right people and get

00:32:22.238 --> 00:32:26.217
you the right paperwork and you can be anyone and
no one will know a fucking difference.

00:32:26.217 --> 00:32:28.193
MARISHA: Calm down there.

00:32:28.193 --> 00:32:31.029
TALIESIN: I can forge paperwork, as well.

00:32:31.029 --> 00:32:34.448
LAURA: Oh yes, he can. He's actually the guy we go
to.

00:32:34.448 --> 00:32:38.334
MARISHA: He is that guy you meet on the corner of
Sandy Alley.

00:32:38.334 --> 00:32:43.709
SAM: I can make us all into birds.

00:32:43.709 --> 00:32:45.990
TRAVIS: Are we supposed to go meet with the
council right away?

00:32:45.990 --> 00:32:47.571
TALIESIN: No, in a week.

00:32:47.571 --> 00:32:50.854
SAM: What do we do in the week? Prepare. Recon?

00:32:50.854 --> 00:32:55.840
LAURA: We can do things. How long of a ride is it
to Kraghammer?

00:32:55.840 --> 00:32:59.043
MATT: To Kraghammer, on horseback? It's about two
and a half days.

00:32:59.043 --> 00:33:00.987
LAURA: Solo style, if you're fast, and back?

00:33:00.987 --> 00:33:07.049
MATT: Fast and back? I'd say just under two days,
probably.

00:33:07.049 --> 00:33:08.931
TALIESIN: How about the giant eagle flies?

00:33:08.931 --> 00:33:10.884
MARISHA: Yeah, what if you're flying?

00:33:10.884 --> 00:33:15.420
MATT: I'd say, well, the horse is probably a
little bit faster than the eagle.

00:33:15.420 --> 00:33:17.921
LAURA: But you don't have to stick to the road as
an eagle.

00:33:17.921 --> 00:33:23.045
MATT: I'd say it'd put you there about the same
pace, about two days on eagle, because you can just

00:33:23.045 --> 00:33:27.918
go straight through. I mean, you want to take the
road because you know that there's a lot of

00:33:27.918 --> 00:33:31.558
dangerous things that wander the wild that are
between there.

00:33:31.558 --> 00:33:43.541
LAURA: What do you think? Is it stupid to go and
ride hard and try to get there and back before--?

00:33:43.541 --> 00:33:46.917
SAM: Wait, we're going to get cash and come back?

00:33:46.917 --> 00:33:51.156
LAURA: We don't all have to go. A couple of us can
make a fast ride.

00:33:51.156 --> 00:33:56.344
MARISHA: Tiberius is working on it, I have a
feeling deep down inside.

00:33:56.344 --> 00:34:01.162
ORION: (laughs) Why would you say that?

00:34:01.162 --> 00:34:04.377
MATT: You know I deduct points for metagaming.

00:34:04.377 --> 00:34:06.067
ORION: I didn't do anything!

00:34:06.067 --> 00:34:09.580
TALIESIN: I agree we should send someone for the
money. I agree.

00:34:09.580 --> 00:34:12.382
SAM: And it won't take us a whole week to prepare
for this party.

00:34:12.382 --> 00:34:14.363
All we need is a couple disguises.

00:34:14.363 --> 00:34:17.821
MARISHA: Yeah, but we need to do research. You
barely know who the Briarwoods are.

00:34:17.821 --> 00:34:23.033
LIAM: We don't know if these people are straight
up gangster, or if there's something supernatural,

00:34:23.033 --> 00:34:31.372
seriously supernatural, about them. That hat would
probably work on 80% of people, but I don't know.

00:34:31.372 --> 00:34:34.014
We don't know anything about them.

00:34:34.014 --> 00:34:37.236
MARISHA: Well, they're not going to recognize any
of us, are they?

00:34:37.236 --> 00:34:39.177
SAM: We could go do some recon.

00:34:39.177 --> 00:34:42.991
TRAVIS: Besides, have we seen all the brothels in
Emon? I don't think so.

00:34:42.991 --> 00:34:51.336
SAM: We should do some research, some
reconnaissance while someone goes for the money.

00:34:51.336 --> 00:34:56.421
LAURA: Or should we wait? I really want the
money.

00:34:56.421 --> 00:34:59.333
TALIESIN: People get married in my family for
money. I think it's perfectly reasonable.

00:34:59.333 --> 00:35:02.083
SAM: Listen, we could all go get the money and be
back in four days, right?

00:35:02.083 --> 00:35:05.417
LAURA: No, because some people need to do some
work. We need to send some people off.

00:35:05.417 --> 00:35:07.095
SAM: Split the party?

00:35:07.095 --> 00:35:08.742
LIAM: Yes.

00:35:08.742 --> 00:35:11.467
LAURA: Hopefully be back in time.

00:35:11.467 --> 00:35:17.008
TALIESIN: There's four days. We can each do our
part. Five days.

00:35:17.008 --> 00:35:20.896
LIAM: Keyleth, can you-- Kiki.

00:35:20.896 --> 00:35:24.694
MARISHA: Yes? Sorry.

00:35:24.694 --> 00:35:27.626
LIAM: Can you and Scanlan fly to Kraghammer?

00:35:27.626 --> 00:35:33.447
MARISHA: Yes. I would like to stop and talk to
Gilmore first, though, before I leave. Do I have

00:35:33.447 --> 00:35:35.727
time for that? I can fly.

00:35:35.727 --> 00:35:39.226
LAURA: Our illustrious god just told us it's
better to stick to the road

00:35:39.226 --> 00:35:41.196
because there's bad things--

00:35:41.196 --> 00:35:44.912
MARISHA: In the air? There's air traffic? I have
to worry about air traffic?

00:35:44.912 --> 00:35:47.487
MATT: By horseback, you want to stick to the road.
By air--

00:35:47.487 --> 00:35:52.278
SAM: By air, though. Check yourself, Kiki--

00:35:52.278 --> 00:35:54.881
MARISHA: What?

00:35:54.881 --> 00:35:57.745
SAM: You, I would assume, use Polymorph as I do.

00:35:57.745 --> 00:35:59.988
MARISHA: No, I use my Beast Shaping.

00:35:59.988 --> 00:36:06.795
SAM: Ooh. That's so sexy. Does that last for
longer than a day?

00:36:06.795 --> 00:36:09.132
MARISHA: It lasts as long as I want it to last.

00:36:09.132 --> 00:36:10.840
SAM: Damn!

00:36:10.840 --> 00:36:14.621
TRAVIS: I go up to the kitchen and look for
something to eat.

00:36:14.621 --> 00:36:16.383
MARISHA: It's in my blood.

00:36:16.383 --> 00:36:18.632
SAM: You can be an animal as long as you want?

00:36:18.632 --> 00:36:21.533
MARISHA: Where are you going with this, Scanlan?

00:36:21.533 --> 00:36:31.600
MATT: You can stay in Beast Shape for a number of
hours equal to half your druid level. Five hours

00:36:31.600 --> 00:36:33.421
right now, you can transform for.

00:36:33.421 --> 00:36:39.526
MARISHA: So when I mean as long as I want, I mean,
long enough to where I've never had to really

00:36:39.526 --> 00:36:41.487
think about it before now.

00:36:41.487 --> 00:36:48.700
SAM: Well then, like me, flying there would not be
an option. We'd have to stop, rest, walk, sleep.

00:36:48.700 --> 00:36:51.032
LAURA: Yeah, that would slow it down a lot.

00:36:51.032 --> 00:36:55.473
MARISHA: Well, I could get ten hours, because I
can use two Beast Shaping abilities.

00:36:55.473 --> 00:36:58.187
LAURA: But that's still a two days' flight--

00:36:58.187 --> 00:37:02.184
LIAM: Two days is the horse, riding hard. What
about an eagle?

00:37:02.184 --> 00:37:06.872
MARISHA: No, I get my druid shapes back after a
short rest.

00:37:06.872 --> 00:37:08.722
LAURA: Oh, okay.

00:37:08.722 --> 00:37:10.871
MARISHA: Because Circle of the Moon, bitch.

00:37:10.871 --> 00:37:15.875
MATT: So you could Beast Shape twice, rest 30
minutes, Beast Shape twice.

00:37:15.875 --> 00:37:24.118
MARISHA: Can I make a stop first, and then I'll
run an errand?

00:37:24.118 --> 00:37:27.316
LIAM: We don't really have a lot of money at the
moment.

00:37:27.316 --> 00:37:28.789
LAURA: She might have some.

00:37:28.789 --> 00:37:30.883
MARISHA: Yeah, I've got my personal fundsies.

00:37:30.883 --> 00:37:35.205
TALIESIN: Can you leave me an earpiece so that I
can keep in contact? I'm not leaving my workshop.

00:37:35.205 --> 00:37:36.760
MARISHA: I have an earpiece, right?

00:37:36.760 --> 00:37:39.736
LAURA: We'll leave you alone, Percy. To work.

00:37:39.736 --> 00:37:42.864
MARISHA: Is there anything else you need from us,
Percy? Is there anything you need

00:37:42.864 --> 00:37:44.272
while I'm out and about?

00:37:44.272 --> 00:37:46.265
TALIESIN: Leave me an earpiece, and I'll call if I
need anything else.

00:37:46.265 --> 00:37:49.649
TRAVIS: Percy, is there anything in this shop that
you want in the Bag of Holding for later?

00:37:49.649 --> 00:37:51.431
TALIESIN: Not yet. Thank you, Grog.

00:37:51.431 --> 00:37:53.261
LAURA: Do you not have an earpiece?

00:37:53.261 --> 00:37:56.680
TRAVIS: I'll give him mine.

00:37:56.680 --> 00:38:05.254
TALIESIN: How many minutes has it been? I'm
wondering if his hands are starting to itch yet.

00:38:05.254 --> 00:38:11.051
MATT: About this time, you start to get this weird
tingling sensation around your fingers.

00:38:11.051 --> 00:38:14.098
TRAVIS: Do they crave blood?

00:38:14.098 --> 00:38:20.309
MATT: No, they crave some sort of an agent that
will prevent the now slight burning sensation.

00:38:20.309 --> 00:38:28.912
TRAVIS: Ow. Quick question. Sorry, I kept
something from falling in the shop-- really quick

00:38:28.912 --> 00:38:33.687
reflexes-- it's making my bits tingle. Do you have
anything for that?

00:38:33.687 --> 00:38:36.865
LIAM: You haven't been scratching yourself, have
you?

00:38:36.865 --> 00:38:40.377
TRAVIS: No, I had that before. Not the same
thing.

00:38:40.377 --> 00:38:44.218
TALIESIN: There's a bucket of water in the corner.
You can try that.

00:38:44.218 --> 00:38:46.498
TRAVIS: I go over to the bucket of water and I
stick my hands in the water.

00:38:46.498 --> 00:38:48.316
TALIESIN: It'll make it worse.

00:38:48.316 --> 00:38:56.035
MATT: It does. The slight burning sensation now
has turned into a very vibrant burning white hot

00:38:56.035 --> 00:38:59.967
on the skin, and you can see bits of the skin
start to peel back a little bit,

00:38:59.967 --> 00:39:01.561
beginning on the edges.

00:39:01.561 --> 00:39:03.682
TALIESIN: I hand him a small bag of powder. Now
you've learned not to touch things if you don't

00:39:03.682 --> 00:39:05.109
know what they are.

00:39:05.109 --> 00:39:06.481
TRAVIS: What do I do with a bag of powder?

00:39:06.481 --> 00:39:08.399
TALIESIN: I pour the powder on his hands.

00:39:08.399 --> 00:39:12.512
MATT: It foams up a little bit in places, but it
is neutralized.

00:39:12.512 --> 00:39:15.999
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:39:15.999 --> 00:39:18.044
TALIESIN: You're a good friend.

00:39:18.044 --> 00:39:23.092
TRAVIS: Can I leave now? I go to the kitchen to
eat.

00:39:23.092 --> 00:39:29.713
MATT: All righty. You easily get another meal
mustered for you.

00:39:29.713 --> 00:39:32.226
MARISHA: I'm going to go make a trip to Gilmore's.
Anybody want to join?

00:39:32.226 --> 00:39:34.810
LIAM: I should probably tag along.

00:39:34.810 --> 00:39:39.340
SAM: I'll come, too.

00:39:39.340 --> 00:39:44.255
MATT: You're working in the workshop, you're
eating, you guys are going to Gilmore's. All

00:39:44.255 --> 00:39:49.860
right. So as this is happening, Tiberius, you make
your way over to the Alabaster Lyceum. You come up

00:39:49.860 --> 00:40:00.349
to the front main area of the structure itself.
It's an arcane college. You make your way to the

00:40:00.349 --> 00:40:06.217
front clerk, who looks up to you, a nice young
fellow, looks like he's trying to work through his

00:40:06.217 --> 00:40:10.139
credit in school through his training. He's
dressed in the ceremonial robes of somebody who is

00:40:10.139 --> 00:40:16.039
a student, who is currently stuck with the job of
working as a clerk. He's like,

00:40:16.039 --> 00:40:18.705
"Hi, can I help you?"

00:40:18.705 --> 00:40:28.386
ORION: Yes, hi, if you do not remember me, I am
Tiberius Stormwind, from Draconia. Moreover, Vox

00:40:28.386 --> 00:40:30.931
Machina, over at Greyskull Keep.

00:40:30.931 --> 00:40:33.438
MATT: "Where have I heard that--"

00:40:33.438 --> 00:40:40.309
ORION: Well, we told you multiple times before. We
met with you using your sigil of teleport-- it's

00:40:40.309 --> 00:40:47.840
fine. I've come here on a matter of business
anyway, so that's neither here nor there. I was

00:40:47.840 --> 00:40:58.052
wondering if I may procure an address, or number
as it were, for a sigil to Kraghammer. I believe

00:40:58.052 --> 00:41:04.147
the Thunderbrands would have some facility near
theirs or on their own premises where their sigil

00:41:04.147 --> 00:41:08.707
could be channeled through the Circle of
Teleportation spell.

00:41:08.707 --> 00:41:13.714
MATT: "If you're talking about sigils for
teleportation, you would probably have to discuss

00:41:13.714 --> 00:41:15.751
"that with Gatekeeper Xanthas."

00:41:15.751 --> 00:41:19.486
ORION: Where is he? I thought that was you.

00:41:19.486 --> 00:41:27.554
MATT: "No. I'm the clerk. I run the front of the--
follow me." And he gets up and leads you further

00:41:27.554 --> 00:41:36.213
into the structure to the central circular room,
the white-marbled room that contains all the doors

00:41:36.213 --> 00:41:42.930
around, and in the center there is the Traverse
Junction. This is the place you guys have stumbled

00:41:42.930 --> 00:41:49.741
into every single time you've teleported back to
Emon. And there you see the elven wizard who you

00:41:49.741 --> 00:41:56.754
recently bothered naught but maybe five hours ago,
who is currently setting up some sheets, comes

00:41:56.754 --> 00:42:00.961
back. "Oh. Hello, again."

00:42:00.961 --> 00:42:10.442
ORION: Hi. I'm Tiberius Stormwind, from Draconia.
Moreover, Vox Machina over at Greyskull Keep. I

00:42:10.442 --> 00:42:16.103
was wondering-- and I asked your clerk here
because I thought he did what you actually do

00:42:16.103 --> 00:42:35.069
here-- if I may procure, for coin or perhaps some
kind of favor of sorts, the address or number or

00:42:35.069 --> 00:42:44.272
code or whatever it is that would work for the
Kraghammer sigil of my Circle of Teleportation.

00:42:44.272 --> 00:42:50.381
MATT: "I get an understanding here that you're
seeking access to one of our many sigil-based

00:42:50.381 --> 00:42:58.105
"rooms of transference. Those rooms are currently
under very protected lock and key, approval by the

00:42:58.105 --> 00:43:00.632
"headmaster Thurmond Adalum himself."

00:43:00.632 --> 00:43:02.684
ORION: Okay, where is he?

00:43:02.684 --> 00:43:06.701
MARISHA: Oh my god. It's like calling Time Warner
Cable.

00:43:06.701 --> 00:43:11.079
ORION: Can you take me to him? Where is he at?

00:43:11.079 --> 00:43:19.414
MATT: Glances over at the clerk, who goes, "Right
this way, Mr. Stormwind." He leads you back to a

00:43:19.414 --> 00:43:27.269
long, long hallway with arched ceiling. You can
see the marble itself has these carvings and

00:43:27.269 --> 00:43:33.643
sculptures of various dead-looking faces of
long-passed mages that either were built or held

00:43:33.643 --> 00:43:41.046
in high esteem in the halls of this lyceum. At the
very end, it opens up into a pretty

00:43:41.046 --> 00:43:48.628
well-decorated, almost over-the-top decorated
office room for the headmaster himself. The

00:43:48.628 --> 00:43:55.365
interior is lined with large, large 15,
20-foot-tall bookshelves around this oval room

00:43:55.365 --> 00:44:01.962
with sliding ladders that are attached to them
that slowly glide on their own, like they're on

00:44:01.962 --> 00:44:07.267
some sort of arcane-based pattern that puts them
back and forth. There is a large chandelier of

00:44:07.267 --> 00:44:15.004
brightly colored orbs that sits 35, 40 feet in the
air, that slowly rotates on its own that keeps

00:44:15.004 --> 00:44:20.457
this slowly fluctuating changing color of the
room. And in the center there is a circular desk,

00:44:20.457 --> 00:44:26.349
and sitting there at the desk you can see is
Headmaster Thurmond, who is this extremely elderly

00:44:26.349 --> 00:44:36.155
human male. Shaved face, very short, curved bald
head with a little bit of hair in the back,

00:44:36.155 --> 00:44:40.556
hunched forward and is currently collecting a
series of books into his arms. Looks like he's

00:44:40.556 --> 00:44:43.953
about to get up. And he turns and looks over. "Can
I help you?"

00:44:43.953 --> 00:44:45.690
ORION: Hello.

00:44:45.690 --> 00:44:49.017
ORION and SAM: I'm Tiberius Stormwind from
Draconia.

00:44:49.017 --> 00:44:56.731
ORION: Moreover, Vox Machina over at Greyskull
Keep here in Emon. We are the saviors of this town

00:44:56.731 --> 00:45:03.629
and whatnot. Anyway, that's neither here nor
there. I went through this fellow, who I thought

00:45:03.629 --> 00:45:11.458
was the job of this fellow, but it wasn't either
of those jobs, it was you who I've been needing to

00:45:11.458 --> 00:45:13.043
talk to, I'm assuming?

00:45:13.043 --> 00:45:15.213
MATT: "What do you require from me, then?"

00:45:15.213 --> 00:45:25.304
ORION: I'm hoping to procure an address or access
to the sigils of Kraghammer through my Circle of

00:45:25.304 --> 00:45:31.330
Teleportation spell and whatnot using your arcane
gates. That's about it.

00:45:31.330 --> 00:45:34.519
(laughter)

00:45:34.519 --> 00:45:36.504
SAM: Well put!

00:45:36.504 --> 00:45:44.350
MATT: "If you're asking for access to one of our
closely guarded sigils for the Thunderbrands, you

00:45:44.350 --> 00:45:45.742
"say, within Kraghammer?"

00:45:45.742 --> 00:45:48.264
ORION: Yes, yes. We'll have to speak with them as
well.

00:45:48.264 --> 00:45:53.954
MATT: "Well, then I will-- just one moment." And
he reaches into a pouch and pulls out this mirror,

00:45:53.954 --> 00:45:59.761
this oval mirror and sets it onto his desk.
Reaches underneath and pulls out a small chest.

00:45:59.761 --> 00:46:03.358
Opens up the chest, and you can see in this chest
that there are probably two dozen of these tiny

00:46:03.358 --> 00:46:08.519
little marbles, all different colors, some
different shapes, and he goes, these little labels

00:46:08.519 --> 00:46:12.441
you can't really see from your perspective. He
takes one out, places it in the top of the mirror,

00:46:12.441 --> 00:46:16.219
and as he does, the mirror all of a sudden
shimmers for a second, and what was originally a

00:46:16.219 --> 00:46:24.372
normal reflection is now this light, glowing blue,
slightly glowing water-like surface. He takes it

00:46:24.372 --> 00:46:34.926
and lifts it up to himself. "Hello. Hello? Hello!"
A moment later, you hear this distant voice

00:46:34.926 --> 00:46:41.653
echoing with this strange warbling filter over it.
"I'm coming, what's taking your time. Yes,

00:46:41.653 --> 00:46:44.265
"Headmaster, what do you require?"

00:46:44.265 --> 00:46:57.787
"Well, there's a gentleman here, dragonborn, who
is requesting use of your sigil of teleportation.

00:46:57.787 --> 00:47:04.065
"Do you know this gentleman?" Turns it around, and
you can see in there, this is the same

00:47:04.065 --> 00:47:13.350
long-bearded dwarven individual that met you at
the actual Thunderbrand house, and had a bit of an

00:47:13.350 --> 00:47:15.736
argument with you early in your travels in
Kraghammer.

00:47:15.736 --> 00:47:22.836
ORION: We've got things for you, this time, like
we said we would get for you. In the Underdark.

00:47:22.836 --> 00:47:28.488
It's really inconvenient, but we have things that
we need to get to you quickly.

00:47:28.488 --> 00:47:36.615
MATT: "Now, listen here. Last we spoke, you and
your friends stormed into our lair, nearly

00:47:36.615 --> 00:47:40.804
"destroyed our precious arcane defenses of our
homestead--"

00:47:40.804 --> 00:47:45.271
ORION: He was drinking. He's an alcoholic. He's
got help since then.

00:47:45.271 --> 00:47:46.874
MATT: Make a deception check.

00:47:46.874 --> 00:47:52.952
ORION: What is it?

00:47:52.952 --> 00:47:59.529
MATT: This is deception. Well, you are an
alcoholic, but that wasn't what he meant.

00:47:59.529 --> 00:48:01.675
ORION: 20.

00:48:01.675 --> 00:48:14.386
MATT: 20. (laughs) He goes, "Either way, we can't
just let anyone willy-nilly knowing how to directly

00:48:14.386 --> 00:48:17.343
"appear in the center of our homestead."

00:48:17.343 --> 00:48:21.039
ORION: (in same accent as Matt) Of course. Oh,
sorry, I started to sound like you.

00:48:21.039 --> 00:48:24.410
(laughter)

00:48:24.410 --> 00:48:28.960
TALIESIN: Bring me another accent, aye.

00:48:28.960 --> 00:48:42.115
ORION: Of course. I wouldn't expect you to. I'm
Tiberius Stormwind, from Draconia. My father

00:48:42.115 --> 00:48:55.486
Kruvanis Stormwind has helped the Council for over
two generations. We come from a noble house, and I

00:48:55.486 --> 00:49:02.676
give you my word that I will never abuse--
abuse?-- however you pronounce it in your tongue.

00:49:02.676 --> 00:49:11.696
The privilege of quickly traveling to your stead
to do business with you, and there would be no

00:49:11.696 --> 00:49:16.765
other intrusion otherwise. I guarantee it as my
name as a Stormwind.

00:49:16.765 --> 00:49:18.878
MATT: Make a persuasion roll.

00:49:18.878 --> 00:49:21.494
SAM: Chief negotiator!

00:49:21.494 --> 00:49:24.463
ORION: That's 11.

00:49:24.463 --> 00:49:34.342
MATT: 11. His head turns to the side a little bit,
peering through you with a slight scowl. "Last we

00:49:34.342 --> 00:49:39.113
"talked, the reason we didn't report you to the
guard for breaking through our defenses was you

00:49:39.113 --> 00:49:43.798
"promised to look beneath the city and bring back
various artifacts you were in search of."

00:49:43.798 --> 00:49:45.224
ORION: Ooh, we found one!

00:49:45.224 --> 00:49:46.332
MATT: "Did you, now?"

00:49:46.332 --> 00:49:48.972
ORION: A couple, yes. And we killed a bunch of
those buttholes.

00:49:48.972 --> 00:49:53.029
MATT: "Can I see one of these artifacts?"

00:49:53.029 --> 00:49:56.454
ORION: I don't have it on me right now.

00:49:56.454 --> 00:50:02.539
MATT: "We're done here, Headmaster." And the
mirror shimmers and closes suddenly.

00:50:02.539 --> 00:50:04.633
MARISHA: Wait. No?

00:50:04.633 --> 00:50:05.908
LIAM: Good try!

00:50:05.908 --> 00:50:08.738
LAURA: We can bring-- oh, we're not there.

00:50:08.738 --> 00:50:11.950
MATT: The headmaster takes the marble out and
says,

00:50:11.950 --> 00:50:14.626
"I'm sorry that didn't seem to go your way."

00:50:14.626 --> 00:50:20.724
ORION: It's fine, Headmaster. I'll be back in
about 15 minutes with the proper proof that we did

00:50:20.724 --> 00:50:26.289
procure the things that the man, that needed to
have proof, did. Excuse me! And I get the hell out

00:50:26.289 --> 00:50:31.914
of there. And as soon as I get out of there, I
cast Fly on myself, and I Gandalf (whoosh) right

00:50:31.914 --> 00:50:33.508
back to the keep.

00:50:33.508 --> 00:50:43.085
MATT: All righty. You're eating. You're crafting.
Are you going with the rest of them to Gilmore?

00:50:43.085 --> 00:50:45.726
LAURA: I don't know. I guess so.

00:50:45.726 --> 00:50:50.984
MATT: All right. You guys make your way to the
outside of Gilmore's Glorious Goods.

00:50:50.984 --> 00:50:54.622
SAM: As we walk, do we see Tiberius fly over our
heads?

00:50:54.622 --> 00:50:57.811
LAURA: Actually, I'm staying at the Keep.

00:50:57.811 --> 00:51:02.591
ORION: Well, Travis is my target, right? Are you
still at the Keep?

00:51:02.591 --> 00:51:04.076
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'm eating.

00:51:04.076 --> 00:51:08.149
MATT: As far as time goes, you haven't quite
gotten to that point yet, for these guys. You get

00:51:08.149 --> 00:51:14.283
to Gilmore's. You enter the interior. You can see
that for the most part, there aren't a lot of

00:51:14.283 --> 00:51:18.450
people in here. It's getting later in the day, and
a lot of the customer business seems to be

00:51:18.450 --> 00:51:24.715
happening almost earlier, either pre-noon, or
around noon. There's no current sign of Gilmore.

00:51:24.715 --> 00:51:31.582
You do see, across the way-- what's her name,
again?

00:51:31.582 --> 00:51:33.142
MARISHA: Sherri.

00:51:33.142 --> 00:51:40.952
MATT: Thank you. Sherri, the mousy helper who runs
the shop in Gilmore's absence, or at least runs

00:51:40.952 --> 00:51:44.537
the first portion of it, with her thick glasses up
on her nose, and she's sitting there with her

00:51:44.537 --> 00:51:56.135
elbows over the top of the main desk. She looks up
as you enter, and takes her glasses and pokes them

00:51:56.135 --> 00:52:00.237
for a second. "Hello? Hi."

00:52:00.237 --> 00:52:01.765
LIAM: Do you remember us?

00:52:01.765 --> 00:52:03.397
MATT: "Right, I do."

00:52:03.397 --> 00:52:10.171
MARISHA: From Vox Machina? We're sponsored by
Gilmore. He put the brand on my armor that my

00:52:10.171 --> 00:52:11.624
mother gave me.

00:52:11.624 --> 00:52:16.938
MATT: "And you should be wearing it proudly, yes?
Now, what can I help you with?"

00:52:16.938 --> 00:52:19.166
SAM: Well, is Gilmore around?

00:52:19.166 --> 00:52:24.696
LIAM: Yes, I was hoping to catch up with him.
We've been gone a while, and I was hoping to trade

00:52:24.696 --> 00:52:28.221
news with Glorious Gilmore. Is he not in at the
moment?

00:52:28.221 --> 00:52:34.338
MATT: "Gilmore's in Westruun, currently setting up
the expansion of the Gilmore's Glorious Goods

00:52:34.338 --> 00:52:38.585
"business. If this is important, I can certainly
summon him here."

00:52:38.585 --> 00:52:46.864
LIAM: I'd hate to pull him away from business. I
don't want to get in the way of his business. I

00:52:46.864 --> 00:52:57.907
mean, I am rather sad not to see him, but no, I
don't think that would be a course of action we'd

00:52:57.907 --> 00:53:00.853
want to take. Let him continue to set up.

00:53:00.853 --> 00:53:02.490
MATT: "All right, I suppose."

00:53:02.490 --> 00:53:04.074
LIAM: Can you get a message to him, though?

00:53:04.074 --> 00:53:05.440
MATT: "Yes, I can, actually."

00:53:05.440 --> 00:53:11.560
LIAM: Well, tell him Vax'ildan and friends
visited. We're in the city for a week.

00:53:11.560 --> 00:53:15.792
MATT: She pulls out a small sheet of what looks
like a rough-around-the-edges piece of parchment,

00:53:15.792 --> 00:53:17.719
and starts the inkwell, scribbling down.

00:53:17.719 --> 00:53:23.265
LIAM: Vax'ildan. That's with an A, not an E. We're
here for a week. I don't know if he's going to be

00:53:23.265 --> 00:53:30.795
back from Westruun before then, but if he is, tell
him to get word to me. I'm very interested in

00:53:30.795 --> 00:53:33.829
exchanging news for the past few weeks.

00:53:33.829 --> 00:53:40.282
MATT: "All right." (foreign words) It flashes and
disappears in front of her. "Well then, he'll be

00:53:40.282 --> 00:53:46.287
"receiving the message right about now. We'll pass
that on, and whenever he returns, I'm certain he

00:53:46.287 --> 00:53:50.694
"will get back to you and deal with whatever
business is necessary."

00:53:50.694 --> 00:53:54.319
LIAM: Thank you. We're here late in the day; are
you still open for business?

00:53:54.319 --> 00:53:56.129
MATT: "We are open, yes."

00:53:56.129 --> 00:54:02.819
MARISHA: I was just curious if you guys had a
chance to think about the alchemy workshop that we

00:54:02.819 --> 00:54:10.391
talked about before, or if you maybe had any
alchemy books that came in that I was requesting?

00:54:10.391 --> 00:54:16.804
MATT: "It's possible. We haven't completely
restocked the shelves, as of late. I know we had

00:54:16.804 --> 00:54:22.402
"some new things come in. I can go check." And as
she turns, all of a sudden there's a large,

00:54:22.402 --> 00:54:29.007
vibrant, white flash of light and a sound from the
back room. The beaded curtains shift, for a

00:54:29.007 --> 00:54:34.496
second, and you hear heavy footsteps. And pushing
through the beaded curtain, you see before you,

00:54:34.496 --> 00:54:43.396
with a bead of sweat on his head, Gilmore! "I'm so
glad you came back!"

00:54:43.396 --> 00:54:45.718
SAM and MARISHA: Gilmore!

00:54:45.718 --> 00:54:50.953
MATT: "I'm sorry. I was out and about, running
some business a ways away."

00:54:50.953 --> 00:54:53.674
LIAM: You didn't have to go to all that trouble to
come back here.

00:54:53.674 --> 00:54:58.358
MATT: "How could I miss seeing my fine-- there's
not as many of you as usual."

00:54:58.358 --> 00:55:02.544
LIAM: No, we're seeing to different bits of
business. I turn back to him, I walk forward with

00:55:02.544 --> 00:55:08.803
hands out. I walk up to him, take him by the head,
give him a good European-style kiss just about here--

00:55:08.803 --> 00:55:15.934
right there-- come back, and say, there is so much
to talk about. Where can we be alone?

00:55:15.934 --> 00:55:25.508
MATT: He looks over at the rest of the group.
"Well, I mean--"

00:55:25.508 --> 00:55:28.305
(laughter)

00:55:28.305 --> 00:55:30.253
MATT "But of course."

00:55:30.253 --> 00:55:32.977
LIAM: See to whatever business you need to.

00:55:32.977 --> 00:55:36.098
SAM: We'll just peruse, yeah. We'll window shop.

00:55:36.098 --> 00:55:40.946
MATT: He walks back through the beaded curtain,
giving you this look over his shoulder. As he

00:55:40.946 --> 00:55:43.201
does, the curtain falls behind him.

00:55:43.201 --> 00:55:45.114
LIAM: Those beads.

00:55:45.114 --> 00:55:47.529
TRAVIS: Oh jeez!

00:55:47.529 --> 00:55:49.518
LIAM: I walk right in. Follow him in.

00:55:49.518 --> 00:55:59.493
MATT: And you can see now, as the glow gently
fades, there is a rug that is pushed to the side,

00:55:59.493 --> 00:56:05.289
and on the floor of his room there is a familiar
sigil, similar to the one that you've seen

00:56:05.289 --> 00:56:11.112
Tiberius scrawl before in some of his spells.
That's apparently how he got here so quickly. But

00:56:11.112 --> 00:56:14.924
he walks in, and he kicks the rug back over it,
sits down on the edge of his bed, puts his hands

00:56:14.924 --> 00:56:20.062
up and goes, "What seems to be troubling you?"

00:56:20.062 --> 00:56:28.499
LIAM: I walk over and I sit down opposite him, and
I say: Before we talk about anything, I feel like

00:56:28.499 --> 00:56:35.541
I should apologize because although we didn't have
any sort of written agreement, you and I are

00:56:35.541 --> 00:56:37.665
friends, aren't we?

00:56:37.665 --> 00:56:38.895
MATT: "Yes."

00:56:38.895 --> 00:56:47.693
LIAM: And I was supposed to help bring your brand
wherever we went. And I thought that would be

00:56:47.693 --> 00:56:58.832
possible. We came back from the Underdark. We had
a very hard time, some of the hardest weeks of my

00:56:58.832 --> 00:57:08.305
life. I haven't delivered on my promise. And I
mean to, but I haven't yet. I apologize

00:57:08.305 --> 00:57:10.786
wholeheartedly. I'm sorry.

00:57:10.786 --> 00:57:24.516
MATT: "That's all right. I understand: people grow
busy. There are things you must tend to, and

00:57:24.516 --> 00:57:28.826
"that's all right. And I appreciate you being so
honest, I really do."

00:57:28.826 --> 00:57:35.829
LIAM: In addition to that, I am changed, and
promises mean more to me, even more than they did

00:57:35.829 --> 00:57:47.398
before. And I promise to follow through. In the
interest of time for the game, DM, Vax tells the

00:57:47.398 --> 00:57:53.236
whole story of the Underdark, of the horn, of how
close it was.

00:57:53.236 --> 00:57:55.669
MARISHA: Ugh, what is taking him so long,
Scanlan?

00:57:55.669 --> 00:57:57.385
SAM: I don't know.

00:57:57.385 --> 00:58:02.580
MATT: While that's happening, the rest of you are
left there awkwardly staring about.

00:58:02.580 --> 00:58:05.791
MARISHA: Did Sherri find my book? Sherri?

00:58:05.791 --> 00:58:08.708
MATT: A few minutes go by. Sherri comes back. She
brings two books over.

00:58:08.708 --> 00:58:14.571
"Best I can tell, these may be what you're
looking for? I can't quite--" She sets them down.

00:58:14.571 --> 00:58:21.564
One is a book that is the properties of various
liquids, chemicals, and things that are found on

00:58:21.564 --> 00:58:27.997
this plane and otherwise. It's a good way to
locate and identify phantom liquids, should you

00:58:27.997 --> 00:58:29.344
come across any.

00:58:29.344 --> 00:58:31.498
MARISHA: That would be good for Scanlan.

00:58:31.498 --> 00:58:34.633
TALIESIN: He is the source of a lot of phantom
liquids.

00:58:34.633 --> 00:58:44.210
MATT: The other book appears to have a section
about alchemy. It's essentially almost a

00:58:44.210 --> 00:58:47.539
beginner's guide, but it's a very, very
easy-to-follow introduction to a number of

00:58:47.539 --> 00:58:56.006
various low-level sorceries and the creation of
low-level spell components preparing them for use

00:58:56.006 --> 00:58:58.928
with spell-casting, and there is a chapter on a
little bit of alchemy.

00:58:58.928 --> 00:59:02.218
MARISHA: Okay, how much are these, Sherri?

00:59:02.218 --> 00:59:04.508
MATT: "They haven't been priced, yet."

00:59:04.508 --> 00:59:07.290
MARISHA: I mean, they're-- they're all right.

00:59:07.290 --> 00:59:13.913
LAURA: Good going, Keyleth! I like it!

00:59:13.913 --> 00:59:16.677
MATT: "25 gold, each."

00:59:16.677 --> 00:59:21.771
MARISHA: 25 gold, each? Oh, come on. I know some
university student dropped these off and donated

00:59:21.771 --> 00:59:26.044
these. Don't kid me, Sherri. Am I doing it right?
Do I sound like Vex?

00:59:26.044 --> 00:59:27.959
MATT: Make a persuasion roll.

00:59:27.959 --> 00:59:29.459
MARISHA: Damn it!

00:59:29.459 --> 00:59:31.798
TALIESIN: I was about to say, make her do a
persuasion roll, it'd be funny.

00:59:31.798 --> 00:59:34.557
SAM: Unforced error.

00:59:34.557 --> 00:59:40.332
TALIESIN: I'm sorry!

00:59:40.332 --> 00:59:45.535
(laughter)

00:59:45.535 --> 00:59:46.989
LIAM: I spoke too soon!

00:59:46.989 --> 00:59:49.365
TRAVIS: So perfect! &lt;i&gt;So&lt;/i&gt; perfect for you.

00:59:49.365 --> 00:59:53.669
MATT: She reaches out and takes the books and
slides them back, and says, "Well, if that's how

00:59:53.669 --> 00:59:58.085
"you feel, perhaps these can be returned to those
university students that perhaps left them by. I

00:59:58.085 --> 00:59:59.615
"should put these in the lost and found."

00:59:59.615 --> 01:00:00.672
MARISHA: Sherri!

01:00:00.672 --> 01:00:07.598
SAM: Sherri. If I may. What Keyleth was trying to
say was that she never got a chance to go to

01:00:07.598 --> 01:00:14.291
college, and that she wanted to get that
university experience.

01:00:14.291 --> 01:00:16.485
MATT: "Good luck."

01:00:16.485 --> 01:00:22.678
SAM: Well, that didn't work. Hey, can you serve
me, now?

01:00:22.678 --> 01:00:28.619
MARISHA: (whispering) Scanlan. Scanlan! Will you
buy those books for me, and I'll reimburse you?

01:00:28.619 --> 01:00:30.465
MATT: "I can hear you. I'm right here."

01:00:30.465 --> 01:00:32.118
(laughter)

01:00:32.118 --> 01:00:33.987
TRAVIS: Walk away!

01:00:33.987 --> 01:00:35.924
MATT: "Yes, I'm happy to help you."

01:00:35.924 --> 01:00:41.383
SAM: I was wondering if you had a small box of
some sort that could carry a magical item, and

01:00:41.383 --> 01:00:44.352
perhaps shield it from detection.

01:00:44.352 --> 01:00:50.671
MATT: "That? Yes, we do have a couple of those.
Hold on." She darts up the stairway in the other

01:00:50.671 --> 01:00:55.110
room and goes to the second floor. A few moments
later, she comes back down with these two small

01:00:55.110 --> 01:01:01.359
chests-- they're about that big, each. One's a
lighter wood color, the other is painted black all

01:01:01.359 --> 01:01:07.551
over. "We have both of these. They should shield
something of this size from most low-level magical

01:01:07.551 --> 01:01:12.335
"detections. These will run you about 200 gold
apiece."

01:01:12.335 --> 01:01:20.527
SAM: I just need one. You're a woman of the world,
and I'm sure you have fine taste, judging by your

01:01:20.527 --> 01:01:25.769
appearance. It is quite fine, if I may say so
myself. If I were a little taller, I would

01:01:25.769 --> 01:01:28.143
probably ask you out on a date.

01:01:28.143 --> 01:01:30.804
MATT: "If you were a little taller, yes."

01:01:30.804 --> 01:01:32.541
MARISHA: Sherri is sassy today!

01:01:32.541 --> 01:01:34.263
ORION: She's full of sass!

01:01:34.263 --> 01:01:36.597
SAM: Which one is the fancier of the two?

01:01:36.597 --> 01:01:40.853
MATT: "Well, looking at these, this one--" She
points to the one that looks like just a casual,

01:01:40.853 --> 01:01:46.597
wood chest. "This would be easier to hide in plain
sight amongst the rest of your furniture. This

01:01:46.597 --> 01:01:53.104
"one, however, would be difficult to locate in a
more shaded, or lightless, circumstance."

01:01:53.104 --> 01:01:56.657
SAM: Hm. I want ostentatiousness.

01:01:56.657 --> 01:01:58.700
MATT: "Then perhaps this one?"

01:01:58.700 --> 01:02:05.578
SAM: Yes, please. That. Thanks. Thank you. 200 to
you. Also, I know Gilmore is otherwise

01:02:05.578 --> 01:02:12.340
entertained. Can you try to identify something for
me? Do you have that-- I mean, judging by the

01:02:12.340 --> 01:02:19.260
glint in your eye and beauty in your heart, I'm
sure you have many skills I don't know about, but

01:02:19.260 --> 01:02:26.124
I'm wondering if you could identify this small,
red vial with a floating something in it, that I

01:02:26.124 --> 01:02:33.573
procured quite some time ago! Do you remember
that?

01:02:33.573 --> 01:02:44.444
MATT: Yes. This vial, if I recall, it has this
small--

01:02:44.444 --> 01:02:47.075
SAM: Have I tried this, once before?

01:02:47.075 --> 01:02:49.950
MATT: No, this is the one that was found--

01:02:49.950 --> 01:02:53.644
SAM: Me and Pike found some stuff in somebody's
house? I don't even remember,

01:02:53.644 --> 01:02:55.185
this was a year ago.

01:02:55.185 --> 01:03:04.616
MATT: Right. Yes, okay. There we go. And make a
persuasion roll, actually, on this one.

01:03:04.616 --> 01:03:06.677
SAM: A lot.

01:03:06.677 --> 01:03:10.058
TALIESIN: Oh, look: a real roll.

01:03:10.058 --> 01:03:11.812
MARISHA: Shut up.

01:03:11.812 --> 01:03:19.458
SAM: Persuasion? It's 35. Wait, 31. 31.

01:03:19.458 --> 01:03:22.168
TRAVIS: Matt just visited his mind palace.

01:03:22.168 --> 01:03:32.499
MATT: She looks at you, and goes, "You have been
good patrons, and you have been much kinder to me

01:03:32.499 --> 01:03:42.059
"than others. We'll put this one on the house.
We'll call this on the house." And as she takes

01:03:42.059 --> 01:03:46.261
the vial, sets it down, and she pulls out another
book that she shuffles through, puts it up, turns

01:03:46.261 --> 01:03:56.889
through a few pages, until, looking through, "This
here would be a Potion of Fire Breath. When

01:03:56.889 --> 01:04:01.598
"imbibed, it should give you a temporary time
period of the ability to breathe fire, much like a

01:04:01.598 --> 01:04:10.237
"relatively young dragon. This one in particular is
fire. There are many different vials like this

01:04:10.237 --> 01:04:14.602
"that pertain to different colorations of dragon,
but this one is specifically for the red."

01:04:14.602 --> 01:04:22.748
SAM: Thank you so much. Thank you. Well, thank you
so much. Two more questions, then I'll leave you

01:04:22.748 --> 01:04:30.947
alone. One: where can I go get business cards
printed up, in this town? It's a calling card?

01:04:30.947 --> 01:04:32.393
Never mind! Forget it.

01:04:32.393 --> 01:04:33.971
MATT: "Like a flyer?"

01:04:33.971 --> 01:04:35.128
SAM: Yes!

01:04:35.128 --> 01:04:42.121
MATT: "Those can be printed. There is a--
actually, a pretty well-designed print facility

01:04:42.121 --> 01:04:43.661
"not that far up the road."

01:04:43.661 --> 01:04:48.951
SAM: Oh, great! Thank you; I'll go investigate
that. And one other thing: you know those books

01:04:48.951 --> 01:04:55.884
that my friend was asking about? Could we maybe
make those happen for her? I know that you had

01:04:55.884 --> 01:05:03.261
quoted her a low, low price of 25. I'd be prepared
to pay even more than that for them. And compose

01:05:03.261 --> 01:05:05.532
you a little song about yourself.

01:05:05.532 --> 01:05:10.500
MATT: At which point, for the first time since the
entire time you've been in the shop of Gilmore's

01:05:10.500 --> 01:05:20.007
Glorious Goods, you see a slight grin creep across
her lips. She goes, "How could a lady say no to a

01:05:20.007 --> 01:05:23.694
"song? 25 gold! The price stands."

01:05:23.694 --> 01:05:26.147
SAM: So I have to pay you and sing to you?

01:05:26.147 --> 01:05:30.412
MATT: "We run a business, here, yes."

01:05:30.412 --> 01:05:32.227
SAM: All right.

01:05:32.227 --> 01:05:33.544
MATT: She pulls the books out.

01:05:33.544 --> 01:05:36.063
SAM: I bring out my-- something.

01:05:36.063 --> 01:05:38.382
(laughter)

01:05:38.382 --> 01:05:54.403
SAM: (sings) Sherri baby, Sherri baby, Sherri,
won't you come home tonight? Come home tonight?

01:05:54.403 --> 01:06:14.154
You better ask your mama. Tell her you're without a
gnome! Why don't you come home to my keep!

01:06:14.154 --> 01:06:15.723
MATT: "Pay for the books!"

01:06:15.723 --> 01:06:18.117
SAM: Okay, here you go!

01:06:18.117 --> 01:06:21.523
MATT: You can see, her face is flushed and she,
(clears throat).

01:06:21.523 --> 01:06:26.425
MARISHA: I Druidcraft a flower real quick and slip
it to Scanlan to give to her.

01:06:26.425 --> 01:06:28.589
SAM: Oh! Here you are.

01:06:28.589 --> 01:06:32.892
MATT: "Thank you."

01:06:32.892 --> 01:06:36.266
TRAVIS: (gasps) Did she blush?

01:06:36.266 --> 01:06:43.932
MATT: She's red in the face. At this point in
time, the beaded curtains reopen. Have you

01:06:43.932 --> 01:06:45.436
finished the conversation, or do you want to keep
going?

01:06:45.436 --> 01:06:50.047
LIAM: No. After ten minutes of finishing all that,
of telling every tiny detail, if you mind me

01:06:50.047 --> 01:06:55.454
backtracking, I briefly place my hand on top of
his, and say, it was terrible. I've never seen

01:06:55.454 --> 01:07:04.443
anything like it. Now we're back. We're in our
home, and I'm hoping to learn how Uriel is doing,

01:07:04.443 --> 01:07:11.826
how the city is faring. Is there any news? Things
are ill in Kraghammer; they still haven't seen the

01:07:11.826 --> 01:07:16.201
last of their troubles, but I'm also concerned for
our new home here.

01:07:16.201 --> 01:07:23.413
MATT: "As far as I'm aware, this city has been
doing rather well. Since Winter's Crest just this

01:07:23.413 --> 01:07:28.211
"previous year, trade has been booming, we're
opening up pathways all across the continent,

01:07:28.211 --> 01:07:34.947
"we've improved relations with many other distant
kingdoms, and I'm opening a second shop! I mean,

01:07:34.947 --> 01:07:36.540
"that's amazing! And who would've thought?"

01:07:36.540 --> 01:07:38.028
LIAM: And Westruun, how's it going?

01:07:38.028 --> 01:07:42.208
MATT: "So far, so good. We're going through the
construction process, and I'm making sure that I

01:07:42.208 --> 01:07:48.963
"have a rather supple income of artifacts and
oddities that I have to sell at both locations. I

01:07:48.963 --> 01:07:54.784
"have to widen my input of various items and--"

01:07:54.784 --> 01:07:56.820
LIAM: You're a busy man.

01:07:56.820 --> 01:07:58.238
MATT: "Oh, yes."

01:07:58.238 --> 01:07:59.948
LIAM: Have you any time for leisure?

01:07:59.948 --> 01:08:07.349
MATT: "Eventually." You can see, he's a little
more worn than you've seen Gilmore before. He's

01:08:07.349 --> 01:08:11.637
still Gilmore, and he's excited, but after the
tale you told him and opening the second shop has

01:08:11.637 --> 01:08:15.293
been a little rough on him, and his jovial self is
a little more wearied.

01:08:15.293 --> 01:08:18.596
Though he still looks fabulous.

01:08:18.596 --> 01:08:24.118
LIAM: You seem a tad weary. Is there anything I
can do to help you?

01:08:24.118 --> 01:08:29.804
MATT: "Just praise the brand. Praise the brand,
young Vax."

01:08:29.804 --> 01:08:39.464
LIAM: That will happen. I did not even mean to
discuss this, coming here, but I noticed, coming

01:08:39.464 --> 01:08:48.553
in, a sigil under your carpet. I had no intention
of this, but we need to get back to Kraghammer in

01:08:48.553 --> 01:08:57.491
a bit of a hurry, and I certainly have no
abilities, but do you remember my friend Tiberius?

01:08:57.491 --> 01:08:59.147
Dragonborn fellow?

01:08:59.147 --> 01:09:01.091
MATT: "Yes! Yes, I remember him."

01:09:01.091 --> 01:09:09.846
LIAM: He needs to run an errand back in
Kraghammer. Is there any way you could hook us up

01:09:09.846 --> 01:09:10.899
with a favor?

01:09:10.899 --> 01:09:13.683
MATT: "What kind of favor?"

01:09:13.683 --> 01:09:20.390
LIAM: I just want to send the lizard to Dwarf
Town. Do you think we could make that happen?

01:09:20.390 --> 01:09:26.049
MARISHA: "Send the lizard to Dwarf Town?" How many
more slurs can you have in one sentence?

01:09:26.049 --> 01:09:36.453
MATT: "My sigil here is for returning personal
use. Did you hear that? There was some strange

01:09:36.453 --> 01:09:47.933
"noise in the sky. This is for my return. As far as
outgoing, most other sigils are-- well, they're up

01:09:47.933 --> 01:09:52.823
"here. Looking for that, you're going to have to go
to the Lyceum, I'm afraid."

01:09:52.823 --> 01:09:54.708
LIAM: Understood. I don't want to push my luck.

01:09:54.708 --> 01:10:06.019
MATT: "However, if you're going to the Lyceum... I
am owed a favor or two. Let me see what I can do,

01:10:06.019 --> 01:10:13.095
"here." And he goes, and he pulls out another piece
of similar paper and he writes a quick little

01:10:13.095 --> 01:10:21.747
note on the side, sends it up in the air, and it
vanishes. He goes, "I've just done you a favor.

01:10:21.747 --> 01:10:28.870
"Keep that in mind. You go to the Lyceum, you
should have access to one of these sigils. Make

01:10:28.870 --> 01:10:32.015
"sure you choose properly. You only have one."

01:10:32.015 --> 01:10:34.795
LIAM: I'm pretty magic-stupid.

01:10:34.795 --> 01:10:40.539
MATT: "Then don't be the one that does it. Talk to
your friend, this Tiberius fellow. He'll know what

01:10:40.539 --> 01:10:41.806
"to do, I'm sure."

01:10:41.806 --> 01:10:49.048
LIAM: Correct. One last. It's small or it's
boring, it's business. I need a dagger. I don't

01:10:49.048 --> 01:10:53.992
want one for free or anything; I want to purchase
it, but we're a little low on funds. The reason

01:10:53.992 --> 01:10:57.617
Tiberius needs to go to Kraghammer is because
we're owed a large sum of money.

01:10:57.617 --> 01:11:01.388
MATT: "Right, you mentioned this last time,
when you almost opened a line of Gilmore's

01:11:01.388 --> 01:11:03.486
"Glorious Credit."

01:11:03.486 --> 01:11:05.697
LAURA: Mm-hm. I'm not there.

01:11:05.697 --> 01:11:08.923
LIAM: What would the credit entail?

01:11:08.923 --> 01:11:15.535
MATT: "Previously, we discussed 25,000 gold
pieces, the amount of which you were going to

01:11:15.535 --> 01:11:16.640
"retrieve."

01:11:16.640 --> 01:11:18.389
LIAM: I was going to-- what was that?

01:11:18.389 --> 01:11:19.558
MATT: "Retrieve."

01:11:19.558 --> 01:11:23.774
LIAM: Retrieve? God, I've been in the Underdark so
long. What was the deal?

01:11:23.774 --> 01:11:31.633
MATT: "The deal was since you did not have funds,
and you had to retrieve this money from this

01:11:31.633 --> 01:11:39.956
"'Dwarf Town', as you so graciously put it, that
you would borrow the money, at the time, and then

01:11:39.956 --> 01:11:45.135
"pay me back within a month. Within a month."

01:11:45.135 --> 01:11:46.934
LIAM: Understood.

01:11:46.934 --> 01:11:50.240
MARISHA: Wait, is Gilmore trying to say we owe him
money?

01:11:50.240 --> 01:11:55.922
LIAM: No. We almost did that. Correct, DM? That's
what we almost did, but we didn't do it. You

01:11:55.922 --> 01:11:56.970
offered it.

01:11:56.970 --> 01:12:00.592
MATT: Correct. You backed out last minute when you
realized there was, apparently, hidden platinum--

01:12:00.592 --> 01:12:07.414
LIAM: I would be interested-- Gilmore? I really
just need a quick favor, and I mean to pay you

01:12:07.414 --> 01:12:14.583
back quickly. I need a dagger for something. Not
your best dagger. Not your shittiest dagger,

01:12:14.583 --> 01:12:24.531
either. I just need something nice. How much would
a fine dagger cost? Something that would be good

01:12:24.531 --> 01:12:29.500
in a fight. And could I pay you back in a couple
of days, once Tiberius returns from Kraghammer?

01:12:29.500 --> 01:12:33.059
MATT: "If you want something functional, there are
masterwork daggers out there. We do have

01:12:33.059 --> 01:12:38.489
"base-level enchantments that give you a fine,
honed edge and a balance that cannot be beaten for

01:12:38.489 --> 01:12:45.579
"its price range. For that, I can easily give you
one of our base-level enchanted items for no more

01:12:45.579 --> 01:12:50.046
"than, friend discount included, 400 gold pieces."

01:12:50.046 --> 01:12:51.934
TALIESIN: That's a pretty good deal.

01:12:51.934 --> 01:12:55.936
LIAM: Can I please purchase three of those?

01:12:55.936 --> 01:12:57.395
MATT: "You may!"

01:12:57.395 --> 01:13:00.461
LIAM: Done.

01:13:00.461 --> 01:13:06.528
MATT: "All right! I'll get these right now!" He
stands up, and now that there's some sort of

01:13:06.528 --> 01:13:10.524
business involved, he's completely renovated and
recharged. He comes through the beaded curtain

01:13:10.524 --> 01:13:17.258
again. You guys see Gilmore burst out, like,
(laughs) "We're in business!" And he goes into the

01:13:17.258 --> 01:13:22.813
next room, and back up the stairs, and takes a few
moments. He comes back down with an armful of

01:13:22.813 --> 01:13:26.389
these daggers, and sets them down on the counter.
"Three for you!

01:13:26.389 --> 01:13:30.866
"That'll be 1,200 gold pieces, please."

01:13:30.866 --> 01:13:37.499
LIAM: I reach out and I give his cheek a little
bubby-squeeze, and I clap him on the cheek, and

01:13:37.499 --> 01:13:44.639
say, I'm good on my word, and you're a good
friend. Thank you, Gilmore.

01:13:44.639 --> 01:13:52.043
MATT: "The least I could do. Pay me back. I'll
find you."

01:13:52.043 --> 01:13:55.296
LIAM: I know you're good on your word.

01:13:55.296 --> 01:13:56.706
MATT: "Indeed."

01:13:56.706 --> 01:14:00.885
LIAM: Keyleth? Scanlan?

01:14:00.885 --> 01:14:06.008
SAM: Oh, yes! How'd it go in there? You're walking
straight, so it couldn't have gone too well.

01:14:06.008 --> 01:14:09.665
LIAM: Very good. Warm in here.

01:14:09.665 --> 01:14:14.221
TALIESIN: That dagger's so sharp, it could cut the
sexual tension.

01:14:14.221 --> 01:14:15.884
ORION: Those are masterwork daggers?

01:14:15.884 --> 01:14:18.961
MATT: They are plus-one enchanted daggers, yes.

01:14:18.961 --> 01:14:22.167
SAM: Well, let's get out of here and go. Did you
find us any--?

01:14:22.167 --> 01:14:26.369
LIAM: I'm good. No, everything's good here. Just
not everywhere else.

01:14:26.369 --> 01:14:28.385
SAM: Let's get out of here, go back to the keep.

01:14:28.385 --> 01:14:34.268
MATT: At this point, now, Tiberius, you have
coasted over the air, and as you come careening

01:14:34.268 --> 01:14:41.424
in, you hear (swishing sounds) and look down. Two
crossbow bolts whiz past you.

01:14:41.424 --> 01:14:43.039
ORION: It's me, you idiots!

01:14:43.039 --> 01:14:49.552
MATT: At which you hear immediately, "Oh, sorry!"
"Sorry! We're not used to having you bolt in from

01:14:49.552 --> 01:14:51.077
"the skyline."

01:14:51.077 --> 01:14:52.977
ORION: I'm in a hurry, sorry! (whoosh)

01:14:52.977 --> 01:14:58.229
MATT: As you sweep past Shayne and Cordell, they
both change their bolts, and they're both arguing

01:14:58.229 --> 01:15:03.212
with each other, like, "You should've seen it was
him!" "Sorry." "Sorry, again!" You make your way

01:15:03.212 --> 01:15:06.269
into the courtyard, inside Greyskull Keep.

01:15:06.269 --> 01:15:08.278
TRAVIS: Why'd you miss?

01:15:08.278 --> 01:15:17.104
ORION: I go into, I rush in to find him eating.
(stammers) Quickly, quickly! And I go into the Bag

01:15:17.104 --> 01:15:20.996
of Holding and I take the item out that we need.
What was it?

01:15:20.996 --> 01:15:22.504
TRAVIS: Well, we have a bunch of stuff.

01:15:22.504 --> 01:15:24.416
MATT: You're not with him, there.

01:15:24.416 --> 01:15:31.648
LAURA: I walk into the room to see Tiberius
throwing things out of the

01:15:31.648 --> 01:15:33.525
Bag of Holding, I'm assuming.

01:15:33.525 --> 01:15:37.667
ORION: I can't, because I have to visualize what
it is to pull it out.

01:15:37.667 --> 01:15:39.432
TRAVIS: Yeah, what are you looking for?

01:15:39.432 --> 01:15:46.692
LIAM: I'm using my earring on the walk home. Does
it work? I don't know what the range is. Tiberius,

01:15:46.692 --> 01:15:48.303
can you hear me? Tibs?

01:15:48.303 --> 01:15:53.439
MATT: You're pretty out of range at this point.

01:15:53.439 --> 01:15:55.700
TRAVIS: What are you looking for, Tiberius?

01:15:55.700 --> 01:16:01.480
ORION: I've taken my hand out. When we were in the
Underdark and one of the items that we procured

01:16:01.480 --> 01:16:04.978
while we were scavenging, and we looted it, and we
could give it back to the Thunderbrand.

01:16:04.978 --> 01:16:07.679
TRAVIS: Oh! Pieces of the enemy? We get paid for
it.

01:16:07.679 --> 01:16:11.448
LAURA: But there were artifacts that they wanted.
I remember.

01:16:11.448 --> 01:16:12.931
MARISHA: They wanted a necklace, right?

01:16:12.931 --> 01:16:14.344
ORION: Yes. And we found one or two of them.

01:16:14.344 --> 01:16:19.302
MARISHA: Found a necklace, who was supposed to
go-- hang on, I'm finding it, I'm looking.

01:16:19.302 --> 01:16:22.688
TRAVIS: I've got two gold necklaces, two gold
chalices, and two rubies.

01:16:22.688 --> 01:16:26.432
MATT: It was actually a magical item, one that you
may have equipped. It'll say in the description of

01:16:26.432 --> 01:16:29.571
the item that it has an inscription on the back.

01:16:29.571 --> 01:16:33.061
ORION: I don't have it.

01:16:33.061 --> 01:16:34.715
TRAVIS: I don't have that shit.

01:16:34.715 --> 01:16:37.413
SAM: Whoa, what? It was a necklace we're talking
about?

01:16:37.413 --> 01:16:41.166
MATT: Protection of some kind, if I recall.
Amulet.

01:16:41.166 --> 01:16:45.841
LAURA: Oh, I don't have that. (gasps) Oh no! What
if we gave it to Kima?

01:16:45.841 --> 01:16:47.460
ORION: We didn't give it to them.

01:16:47.460 --> 01:16:49.569
LAURA: But Kima took some armor we found!

01:16:49.569 --> 01:16:51.167
SAM: "Amulet of Natural Armor?"

01:16:51.167 --> 01:16:54.732
MATT: Look in the description of the item. It
should say underneath the name. It'll have the

01:16:54.732 --> 01:16:58.022
actual inscription written in the descriptor of
the item.

01:16:58.022 --> 01:17:05.005
TRAVIS: Everybody look at your stuff. I look
inside my Belt of Dwarvenkind, and it says

01:17:05.005 --> 01:17:06.431
"Badass."

01:17:06.431 --> 01:17:10.533
MARISHA: It's a sapphire pendant that should say,
"To Lorna, my love."

01:17:10.533 --> 01:17:11.737
LAURA: (gasps) Oh!

01:17:11.737 --> 01:17:21.718
ORION: That's what I reach in and grab. There you
go! Keyleth. I mean, your highness.

01:17:21.718 --> 01:17:23.669
I like your hair.

01:17:23.669 --> 01:17:24.740
MARISHA: Thank you!

01:17:24.740 --> 01:17:25.996
ORION: It looks cool.

01:17:25.996 --> 01:17:27.042
MARISHA: Thanks!

01:17:27.042 --> 01:17:29.358
MATT: It is enchanted.

01:17:29.358 --> 01:17:32.823
MARISHA: It's not the one you're wearing, right,
Scanlan?

01:17:32.823 --> 01:17:36.438
LAURA: No, I remember we found it and nobody
equipped it.

01:17:36.438 --> 01:17:39.510
TRAVIS: I had it in the bag, yeah.

01:17:39.510 --> 01:17:48.149
ORION: I take it out, and I put it in mine. Grog,
I'm finding out a way, as soon as I can show this

01:17:48.149 --> 01:17:54.861
to you, fellow. I'm going to go into Kraghammer
very, very fast as opposed to slowly, and it is,

01:17:54.861 --> 01:17:57.756
so we should leave right now.

01:17:57.756 --> 01:17:59.030
LAURA: Can I go with you?

01:17:59.030 --> 01:18:01.575
ORION: Yeah, and I'll cast-- because, who was
around, just them two?

01:18:01.575 --> 01:18:02.624
MATT: Just those two.

01:18:02.624 --> 01:18:06.723
ORION: I cast Fly again at 3rd or 4th level, to
cast on them.

01:18:06.723 --> 01:18:08.146
TRAVIS: I don't want to go!

01:18:08.146 --> 01:18:10.617
MATT: Now, all of a sudden, you're (whoosh) lifted
up in the air.

01:18:10.617 --> 01:18:14.175
ORION: Yes, but we get there much faster if we fly.
And I go.

01:18:14.175 --> 01:18:15.664
LAURA: And I take off after him!

01:18:15.664 --> 01:18:17.206
TRAVIS: What if I want to stay?

01:18:17.206 --> 01:18:19.041
ORION: You can stay.

01:18:19.041 --> 01:18:25.560
TRAVIS: But I'm fucking floating above my meal!
No! This is bullshit. And I'm bouncing off the

01:18:25.560 --> 01:18:28.654
ceiling and shit. Can I control myself?

01:18:28.654 --> 01:18:30.542
MATT: You can. It takes a moment to adjust to it.

01:18:30.542 --> 01:18:35.897
TRAVIS: I just start trying to swim down to my
plate.

01:18:35.897 --> 01:18:38.118
MATT: It takes you a little bit, but you do
eventually get control of it.

01:18:38.118 --> 01:18:44.997
TRAVIS: (eating noises) This isn't so bad.
(farting noise)

01:18:44.997 --> 01:18:46.343
MATT: Propulsion does work.

01:18:46.343 --> 01:18:50.307
LAURA: As we're flying, can I keep an eye out for
our party members that are returning?

01:18:50.307 --> 01:18:54.520
MATT: Yep. And as you guys coast over, you see,
leaving the exterior wall gate to the south side

01:18:54.520 --> 01:18:58.487
of Emon, you see the rest of your party walking
back towards the keep.

01:18:58.487 --> 01:19:00.470
LAURA: That means we're close enough. Brother!

01:19:00.470 --> 01:19:01.864
LIAM: Hello?

01:19:01.864 --> 01:19:07.190
LAURA: We're heading to the portal, Tiberius is
working on something. We can get there faster!

01:19:07.190 --> 01:19:08.676
I'll be back soon.

01:19:08.676 --> 01:19:12.697
LIAM: Oh, all right. Gilmore has an in: he said we
just need to mention his name and we're through.

01:19:12.697 --> 01:19:14.132
We can send Tiberius through.

01:19:14.132 --> 01:19:15.235
LAURA: Brilliant!

01:19:15.235 --> 01:19:23.802
ORION: Ooh, that gives me a wonderful idea! And
then, I'll cast it at 4th level again, and I'll go

01:19:23.802 --> 01:19:26.015
(pew-pew!) and cast it on--

01:19:26.015 --> 01:19:28.922
MARISHA: Just because I think it's funny-- Grog is
flying over too, right?

01:19:28.922 --> 01:19:31.499
TRAVIS: I'm in that kitchen, floating around,
farting and eating food.

01:19:31.499 --> 01:19:37.832
Look, I've got priorities.

01:19:37.832 --> 01:19:40.599
MARISHA: Okay, well, I see you guys are flying?
The two of you?

01:19:40.599 --> 01:19:42.945
MATT: So you fly down and cast Fly on the rest of
them?

01:19:42.945 --> 01:19:44.692
ORION: Right. Come on, follow me!

01:19:44.692 --> 01:19:48.770
LIAM: Holy shit, I've never flown before! This is
amazing!

01:19:48.770 --> 01:19:50.263
SAM: I'm flying, too? What's happening?

01:19:50.263 --> 01:19:54.865
MATT: You guys are now floating. You guys are
floating, as well. You're coasting over Emon for

01:19:54.865 --> 01:20:08.488
roughly 12 or so seconds before Grog, you drop to
the ground, and now Tiberius and Vex,

01:20:08.488 --> 01:20:09.988
you begin to plummet.

01:20:09.988 --> 01:20:11.330
LAURA: Why are we plummeting?

01:20:11.330 --> 01:20:15.518
MATT: Fly is a concentration spell. You cast it
again. Your amulet keeps it up for two rounds,

01:20:15.518 --> 01:20:19.043
which is 12 seconds, and then the previous Fly
spell deteriorates.

01:20:19.043 --> 01:20:20.744
ORION: What about my circlet?

01:20:20.744 --> 01:20:24.503
MATT: That's what I'm saying. The circlet lets you
maintain concentration for two additional rounds.

01:20:24.503 --> 01:20:28.499
LAURA: Oh, okay! Tiberius, I'm falling!

01:20:28.499 --> 01:20:36.412
ORION: I cast Fly again at 6th-level on everybody
else.

01:20:36.412 --> 01:20:37.967
SAM: I start falling.

01:20:37.967 --> 01:20:40.058
ORION: No, because I can catch everybody.

01:20:40.058 --> 01:20:43.398
MATT: At that point, now all of you guys are
flying.

01:20:43.398 --> 01:20:47.799
ORION: You fall in the kitchen, though.

01:20:47.799 --> 01:20:50.992
TRAVIS: Well, that makes sense.

01:20:50.992 --> 01:20:53.642
LIAM: Is this going to stick, Tiberius?

01:20:53.642 --> 01:20:58.771
ORION: Yes. It's the same spell. I just really
need a nap after this. I really need a nap after

01:20:58.771 --> 01:21:04.900
this. I go back to gather them all.

01:21:04.900 --> 01:21:12.787
MATT: You make your way. Now, all of you following
Tiberius, you coast down to the Alabaster Lyceum,

01:21:12.787 --> 01:21:18.988
landing right through the front area (whoosh),
this whole party appears. Catch your feet, and

01:21:18.988 --> 01:21:23.769
there you see the same clerk looking up. "Ah, I
see you've returned."

01:21:23.769 --> 01:21:29.101
ORION: Yes. Can we not talk to the middle guy
first? Can we go right to the last guy?

01:21:29.101 --> 01:21:31.403
MATT: "Down that hallway. Follow it to the very
end."

01:21:31.403 --> 01:21:33.045
ORION: Thank you very much.

01:21:33.045 --> 01:21:34.257
MATT: "You're welcome."

01:21:34.257 --> 01:21:36.437
ORION: Follow me, everybody!

01:21:36.437 --> 01:21:42.200
MATT: You all glide through the hallway, or walk,
if you prefer. The end of the hallway, you open

01:21:42.200 --> 01:21:47.789
once again into the office, and there you see
behind his desk once again, the headmaster

01:21:47.789 --> 01:21:53.952
Thurmond, who looks around. "Oh, yes. You've
returned. I received the note from your friend

01:21:53.952 --> 01:21:58.544
"Gilmore, and you're welcome to utilize one of our
sigils."

01:21:58.544 --> 01:22:01.227
ORION: Wonderful. That makes me quite happy.

01:22:01.227 --> 01:22:02.786
MATT: "To Kraghammer, was it?"

01:22:02.786 --> 01:22:08.993
ORION: Yes, but I do not want to use that favor
for that sigil. I would like to call our friends,

01:22:08.993 --> 01:22:14.927
and I brought the item. I bring out the amulet. I
want to show our friends in Kraghammer that we

01:22:14.927 --> 01:22:20.285
actually brought them the thing to get their
permission to go on their sigil, and the other

01:22:20.285 --> 01:22:22.551
continent that we were on is called what?

01:22:22.551 --> 01:22:24.374
LAURA: Vasselheim?

01:22:24.374 --> 01:22:31.787
ORION: Yes. The favor I would like for Gilmore is
to get the Vasselheim sigil, please. But let's

01:22:31.787 --> 01:22:33.841
contact our friends at Kraghammer first.

01:22:33.841 --> 01:22:42.186
MATT: "Two notes. There is no sigil in Vasselheim.
They have been outlawed and destroyed to prevent

01:22:42.186 --> 01:22:50.490
"arcane intrusion or subterfuge. There have been,
historically, many a war's passed in which

01:22:50.490 --> 01:22:56.928
"Vasselheim nearly fell to the sudden appearance
of small armies within its walls, and as such,

01:22:57.094 --> 01:23:02.764
"many of these sigils, all of them have been
destroyed over the past 1,000 years. However, it

01:23:02.764 --> 01:23:07.329
"was the third war--" And he's going into a long
diatribe about the history of Vasselheim.

01:23:07.329 --> 01:23:17.238
LAURA: You are so educated. Perhaps we could talk
later about all of this wonderful history.

01:23:17.238 --> 01:23:22.890
MATT: "Certainly. Yes, I'm sorry. The mirror." He
pulls up the mirror, pulls out his chest, brings

01:23:22.890 --> 01:23:32.299
out the same marble again, pops it into the
mirror. It shimmers. "Hello? Hello?" You hear

01:23:32.299 --> 01:23:41.370
another voice say, "Oh, are you kidding me?
Really? You again? All right, what are you

01:23:41.370 --> 01:23:42.659
"bothering me with?"

01:23:42.659 --> 01:23:48.752
ORION: Using my Mage Hand, I'm like, it's one of
the things that you wanted us to get.

01:23:48.752 --> 01:23:50.150
LAURA: Who are you talking to?

01:23:50.150 --> 01:23:52.857
ORION: I can see it. It's fine.

01:23:52.857 --> 01:23:55.650
MATT: "What's it say? I can't read it from here.
Read it out for me."

01:23:55.650 --> 01:23:57.743
ORION: What does it say, Keyleth?

01:23:57.743 --> 01:24:01.025
MARISHA: To Lorna, with love. It's written right
there, Tiberius.

01:24:01.025 --> 01:24:06.302
ORION: Oh, sorry. To Lorna, with love.

01:24:06.302 --> 01:24:13.172
MATT: At which point, you see the eyes of this
dwarf that were very untrusting open wide for a

01:24:13.172 --> 01:24:23.099
second. "All right. Give him the sigil. Send him
through. I'll see you soon."

01:24:23.099 --> 01:24:25.488
The mirror gives out again.

01:24:25.488 --> 01:24:27.197
LAURA: Oh, all of us?

01:24:27.197 --> 01:24:33.419
MATT: No, the headmaster takes the mirror and puts
it down. He points back to the clerk who's in the

01:24:33.419 --> 01:24:38.489
hallway behind you again, waiting, and says, "Go
ahead and bring them to the Junction. Allow them

01:24:38.489 --> 01:24:48.325
"access to the sigil for House Thunderbrand in
Kraghammer." He nods. "Of course."

01:24:48.325 --> 01:24:53.172
ORION: As he's doing this, I'm writing the sigil
that I'm seeing forming in my--

01:24:53.172 --> 01:24:57.923
MATT: He leads you to the Junction, and there is
one of the doors he opens up on the inside, there

01:24:57.923 --> 01:25:05.558
is the actual sigil to Kraghammer there. He gives
you some time to study it, you memorize it, you

01:25:05.558 --> 01:25:11.263
get it locked in, and you now permanently know the
sigil of teleportation to Kraghammer within the

01:25:11.263 --> 01:25:13.109
House Thunderbrand.

01:25:13.109 --> 01:25:18.753
ORION: Shall we go collect our money now?

01:25:18.753 --> 01:25:21.266
SAM and LAURA: Yes.

01:25:21.266 --> 01:25:25.127
LIAM: We're all going? All of us?

01:25:25.127 --> 01:25:30.584
MARISHA: Well, I guess just the five of us, cause
Grog and Percy are back at the Keep.

01:25:30.584 --> 01:25:32.710
SAM: Would you rather just send Tiberius, then?

01:25:32.710 --> 01:25:35.009
LAURA: No, we should go.

01:25:35.009 --> 01:25:37.697
MARISHA: I can go back and check in on them.

01:25:37.697 --> 01:25:41.488
ORION: Everybody's here but Grog.

01:25:41.488 --> 01:25:42.729
TALIESIN: And me.

01:25:42.729 --> 01:25:45.637
ORION: Wait, where are you? Oh, you're working.
Tinkering.

01:25:45.637 --> 01:25:48.060
LIAM: I have an errand to run.

01:25:48.060 --> 01:25:52.976
MARISHA: You have an errand to run? All right,
I'll go with Vax--

01:25:52.976 --> 01:25:59.734
LAURA: It's the three of us, me and you and--

01:25:59.734 --> 01:26:04.286
ORION: Okay. Thunderbrands are buttholes, though.

01:26:04.286 --> 01:26:06.960
SAM: That's all right. That's why we're taking the
heaviest hitters.

01:26:06.960 --> 01:26:13.388
MARISHA: Wait. We'll address that later. Come on,
Vax.

01:26:13.509 --> 01:26:15.100
LAURA: Persuasion-wise.

01:26:15.100 --> 01:26:20.020
MATT: So you guys head back to the Keep, you meet
up with Grog and Percy, what about you guys?

01:26:20.020 --> 01:26:26.010
What're you doing? For, Tiberius, Scanlan, and
Vex.

01:26:26.010 --> 01:26:27.373
LAURA: We go through.

01:26:27.373 --> 01:26:29.677
MATT: Well, it's just the sigil. You have to cast
the spell.

01:26:29.677 --> 01:26:30.738
LAURA and SAM: Oh.

01:26:30.738 --> 01:26:34.089
ORION: Yeah. Is that what you want to do? Is that
what's going on?

01:26:34.089 --> 01:26:36.027
SAM: It's a spell?

01:26:36.027 --> 01:26:50.030
ORION: Oh, shit. No, actually, I need to sleep.
All that flying left me a bit exhausted.

01:26:50.030 --> 01:26:52.072
LAURA: Oh my god.

01:26:52.072 --> 01:26:54.941
LIAM: Sorcerers, they improvise.

01:26:54.941 --> 01:26:57.713
LAURA: Wait, you're saying that we cannot go
through?

01:26:57.713 --> 01:27:01.696
ORION: Well, hold on. Maybe there's a way I could
trigger the spell?

01:27:01.696 --> 01:27:03.681
SAM: Let's go home and go to sleep.

01:27:03.681 --> 01:27:14.052
ORION: Let's get a drink, maybe? It's only been a
day.

01:27:14.052 --> 01:27:17.216
MARISHA: You can cast that sigil anywhere, right?
You don't have to be here?

01:27:17.216 --> 01:27:19.507
We could do it from home.

01:27:19.507 --> 01:27:21.597
LAURA: Then let's just fucking go home.

01:27:21.597 --> 01:27:24.074
ORION: What time of the day is this? It's still
afternoonish, right?

01:27:24.074 --> 01:27:26.512
MATT: At this point in time, with all the travel
back and forth, it's getting close to dusk.

01:27:26.512 --> 01:27:27.771
ORION: Great.

01:27:27.771 --> 01:27:32.002
MARISHA: We'll take a nap and we'll go tomorrow.
It's getting late, the Thunderbrands are probably

01:27:32.002 --> 01:27:34.811
going to bed at this point. We don't want to
invade.

01:27:34.811 --> 01:27:36.715
They're probably just sitting down for dinner.

01:27:36.715 --> 01:27:39.330
SAM: They live in the Underdark. There's no real
time there.

01:27:39.330 --> 01:27:44.347
ORION: My swallow's been crafted at the other
place, right? Has that happened already?

01:27:44.347 --> 01:27:48.347
MATT: Yeah, it's been crafted for you, yeah. It's
not a swallow.

01:27:48.347 --> 01:27:50.185
It's a quarterstaff with knives attached.

01:27:50.185 --> 01:27:58.024
ORION: I'm calling it swallow. On the way back,
because we're obviously going to leave in the

01:27:58.024 --> 01:28:05.851
morning, to do stuff. I'd like to quickly stop at
any blacksmith I see on the

01:28:05.851 --> 01:28:08.043
way back to Greyskull Keep.

01:28:08.043 --> 01:28:11.216
MATT: Okay. Yeah, there are a couple blacksmiths
that you know about on the way through.

01:28:11.216 --> 01:28:16.685
ORION: Okay. I go to the good one, not the bad
one, per reputation.

01:28:16.685 --> 01:28:20.018
MATT: Best reputation is Karin, but she's a
specialist. She's the one that made Trinket's--

01:28:20.018 --> 01:28:21.236
LAURA: Yeah, Karin!

01:28:21.236 --> 01:28:23.392
ORION: I'll go to her, because she's awesome.

01:28:23.392 --> 01:28:26.751
MATT: All right. You go on and approach there.
She's currently working away on some custom piece

01:28:26.751 --> 01:28:30.758
that she's currently working on. She's like,
"Hello, can I help you, dragonborn?"

01:28:30.758 --> 01:28:37.475
ORION: Yes, I'm Tiberius Stormwind from Draconia;
moreover, from Vox Machina--

01:28:37.475 --> 01:28:39.011
MATT: "What can I help you with?"

01:28:39.011 --> 01:28:44.226
ORION: Oh. Sorry, right. We've done business
before. I would like to commission you. And as

01:28:44.226 --> 01:28:49.877
I'm doing this I'm taking out five of my daggers
that I have, and I'm going to hand them to her. I

01:28:49.877 --> 01:28:58.223
would like to commission you to somehow craft
these daggers into a type of bended glaive, if you

01:28:58.223 --> 01:29:01.095
would. I don't know how long it would take you to
do so.

01:29:01.095 --> 01:29:03.011
MATT: "What?"

01:29:03.011 --> 01:29:09.599
ORION: You see, it's like, it would look like
this, but it's--

01:29:09.599 --> 01:29:10.857
SAM: Krull?

01:29:10.857 --> 01:29:21.308
ORION: Yeah, totally, but the blades are bended,
but they're all connected in the center. You could

01:29:21.308 --> 01:29:25.260
use an iron, or a steel ingot to connect the--

01:29:25.260 --> 01:29:26.978
MATT: "I can certainly try, yeah, aye."

01:29:26.978 --> 01:29:28.244
ORION: Wonderful!

01:29:28.244 --> 01:29:36.894
MATT: "All right. It would take me about two days?
And you've already supplied the material, other

01:29:36.894 --> 01:29:39.702
"than a bit of the side bits. I'll say I'll charge
you 100 gold pieces."

01:29:39.702 --> 01:29:41.502
ORION: 100 gold pieces?

01:29:41.502 --> 01:29:42.663
MATT: "Aye, I'm a specialist!"

01:29:42.663 --> 01:29:44.796
SAM: You went to the good one.

01:29:44.796 --> 01:29:50.769
ORION: What, that's all? I mean, oh yes, of
course. Here's 120.

01:29:50.769 --> 01:29:57.150
MATT: "Certainly. Thank you. All right, it should
be done within the next two days. You're free to

01:29:57.150 --> 01:29:59.670
"come by and check on it if you like, but it'll be
done."

01:29:59.670 --> 01:30:02.578
ORION: I trust your work. Trinket's armor was
fantastic.

01:30:02.578 --> 01:30:04.793
MATT: "Huh?"

01:30:04.793 --> 01:30:07.340
ORION: Did she do that? I thought that was the
same character.

01:30:07.340 --> 01:30:09.118
LAURA: This is Karin.

01:30:09.118 --> 01:30:13.186
SAM: She just thought bear. She just knows bear.

01:30:13.186 --> 01:30:15.381
ORION: Bear's armor. The bear's armor was--

01:30:15.381 --> 01:30:19.105
MATT: "Oh! You're friends with that one? She was
real nice. That bear was adorable.

01:30:19.105 --> 01:30:20.543
"Happy to help with that one."

01:30:20.543 --> 01:30:22.008
ORION: His name is Trinket.

01:30:22.008 --> 01:30:23.357
MATT: "Oh, is that what it was?"

01:30:23.357 --> 01:30:25.217
ORION: I'm surprised she didn't tell you. It's an
adorable name.

01:30:25.217 --> 01:30:26.927
MATT: "Probably had. It's just been a while."

01:30:26.927 --> 01:30:28.156
ORION: This is Lockheed.

01:30:28.156 --> 01:30:31.266
MATT: "Oh, you're so cute, Lockheed." You guys
talk for a little bit and

01:30:31.266 --> 01:30:32.853
eventually make your way back.

01:30:32.853 --> 01:30:35.776
ORION: I do business with her, and I go back to
the keep.

01:30:35.776 --> 01:30:41.228
SAM: Are we still waiting for him outside?

01:30:41.228 --> 01:30:42.503
MATT: Yeah, you guys are right outside.

01:30:42.503 --> 01:30:47.752
SAM: When he comes out, I cast Minor Illusion to
make it look like I have a long gray beard.

01:30:47.752 --> 01:30:51.550
(laughter)

01:30:51.550 --> 01:30:54.333
SAM: Can we go home now, please, Tiberius?

01:30:54.333 --> 01:30:56.542
ORION: Yes. Sorry.

01:30:56.542 --> 01:30:59.625
SAM: Any other stops you'd like to make? The
dry-cleaners, perhaps?

01:30:59.625 --> 01:31:02.013
ORION: Prestidigitation.

01:31:02.013 --> 01:31:07.025
SAM: Oh, that's great. Now let's go night-night so
you can cast a spell on us.

01:31:07.025 --> 01:31:10.106
MATT: All right, you guys head back to the keep.

01:31:10.106 --> 01:31:12.106
LIAM: While they're doing that, I stealth away
from the group.

01:31:12.106 --> 01:31:16.329
MARISHA: Can I do a passive perception check to
see if I notice him sneaking away?

01:31:16.329 --> 01:31:20.854
ORION: I would like to fart. Natural 20!

01:31:20.854 --> 01:31:23.400
SAM: It's a huge fart.

01:31:23.400 --> 01:31:26.570
MATT: Go ahead and roll perception.

01:31:26.570 --> 01:31:28.291
LIAM: I rolled a 32.

01:31:28.291 --> 01:31:29.568
MARISHA: Perception or passive perception?

01:31:29.568 --> 01:31:33.775
MATT: For this, because it's not active? It would
be your passive.

01:31:33.775 --> 01:31:37.175
MARISHA: Then that is 24.

01:31:37.175 --> 01:31:46.943
MATT: Vax has vanished. While you might have
noticed, instead the explosion-like eruption of

01:31:46.943 --> 01:31:53.656
gas from your dragonborn friend distracted you and
gave him the proper getaway. You vanish.

01:31:53.656 --> 01:31:59.228
LIAM: Yeah, I'm totally down an alleyway, through
the alley, onto another main thoroughfare. I grab

01:31:59.228 --> 01:32:05.458
a random person on the street. Excuse me, I'm
looking for a specific butcher. Harold the

01:32:05.458 --> 01:32:09.240
butcher. Do you know? I think he's in the upper
slums. Can you point me toward him?

01:32:09.240 --> 01:32:15.346
MATT: The individual you stopped is a younger
gentleman, probably in his mid-20s or so, a bit

01:32:15.346 --> 01:32:20.395
dirty in the face and coming from a day of work,
going to the local tavern to finish his eve with

01:32:20.395 --> 01:32:27.358
some drinks. "I can't say I do. I mean, there are
butchers all over town. There's one--"

01:32:27.358 --> 01:32:30.260
LIAM: Where's the upper slums? Upper slums,
please.

01:32:30.260 --> 01:32:34.051
MATT: "Oh, that would be north side of Emon. That
way." He points you towards the--

01:32:34.051 --> 01:32:37.339
LIAM: I don't even say anything else. I just walk.
I don't know how long that will take me.

01:32:37.339 --> 01:32:43.855
MATT: It will take you about, from where you are
right now, 30 minutes. All right, so you guys get

01:32:43.855 --> 01:32:48.797
back to the keep. Grog has eaten his fill.

01:32:48.797 --> 01:32:50.322
TRAVIS: I'm asleep on the table.

01:32:50.322 --> 01:32:55.138
MATT: Yeah. Passed out. Percy's nowhere to be
seen. You, I would like for you to make a

01:32:55.138 --> 01:33:01.274
tinkering roll in relation to the construction of
ammunition.

01:33:01.274 --> 01:33:05.037
TALIESIN: Ten.

01:33:05.037 --> 01:33:16.588
MATT: Ten? You manage to, utilizing material for
20 bullets, only craft ten. But you get ten

01:33:16.588 --> 01:33:19.636
bullets out of it, as opposed to wasting the
materials.

01:33:19.636 --> 01:33:29.882
ORION: Is it possible to, before I go to sleep, I
have a basic poison potion I've been hoarding.

01:33:29.882 --> 01:33:34.746
Could I try to dip the tip of one of my bolts in
that?

01:33:34.746 --> 01:33:41.645
MATT: You can certainly try. There's a difference
between poison and disease. They're different. The

01:33:41.645 --> 01:33:43.509
potion seems to have no effect.

01:33:43.509 --> 01:33:44.858
ORION: On bolts?

01:33:44.858 --> 01:33:47.713
MATT: It doesn't have any effect.

01:33:47.713 --> 01:33:50.606
TALIESIN: How many batches of bullets are you
going to let me attempt to make?

01:33:50.606 --> 01:33:55.561
MATT: For the day, that's what you spent making.
Tomorrow, we'll get to whatever it is you want to

01:33:55.561 --> 01:34:00.155
craft then. You go off and manage to make your way
to the upper slums.

01:34:00.155 --> 01:34:05.480
LIAM: Yes. I see a stunted old woman and stop her
on the street and say, Grandmother. I'm looking

01:34:05.480 --> 01:34:11.154
for Harold the butcher. Do you know where I can
find him?

01:34:11.154 --> 01:34:18.945
MATT: "Best I can gather, he'd be around that
way." She points you, and the breath is awful.

01:34:18.945 --> 01:34:23.958
She's missing teeth, but her crooked finger curves
off to the side, and you can see across the way,

01:34:23.958 --> 01:34:33.817
next to a homestead or hovel, there is a very
humble-looking butcher that is currently in the

01:34:33.817 --> 01:34:34.939
process of closing shop.

01:34:34.939 --> 01:34:39.390
LIAM: I'd like to go stealth. I rolled a 20.

01:34:39.390 --> 01:34:46.051
MATT: All right. You make your way up there. You
can see there's an older gentleman in his mid-40s

01:34:46.051 --> 01:34:49.915
or so, salt-and-pepper hair, black with a bit of
gray on the sides,

01:34:49.915 --> 01:34:52.232
is currently in the process of closing up.

01:34:52.414 --> 01:34:58.398
LIAM: Do I see Kynan anywhere? No? And it's a
home? It's a business and a home?

01:34:58.497 --> 01:35:01.745
MATT: It's hard to tell. It looks like a business
from this perspective.

01:35:01.872 --> 01:35:06.714
LIAM: Okay, I'd like to go around the back of the
building and scope it out.

01:35:06.714 --> 01:35:12.015
MATT: You look through the windows. There's a dull
light on the inside from what looks like a small

01:35:12.129 --> 01:35:17.334
hooded lantern set up for a bit of interior light,
but there's nobody else in the house.

01:35:17.334 --> 01:35:22.902
LIAM: There's nobody in? I'd like to, at the
window, listen and use perception to see if I can

01:35:22.902 --> 01:35:24.638
tell if anyone's inside.

01:35:24.638 --> 01:35:27.329
MATT: You listen for a while. Make a perception
roll.

01:35:27.329 --> 01:35:33.225
LIAM: Yeah, that's 25.

01:35:33.225 --> 01:35:39.902
MATT: All right. As you continue to listen,
eventually you hear the slamming of wood. You look

01:35:39.902 --> 01:35:43.676
off, and through the bit of the glass window--
you're peeking from the side-- you see the same

01:35:43.676 --> 01:35:49.294
gentleman who was closing the shop enter the room
where the hooded lantern is. There's a table. He

01:35:49.294 --> 01:35:54.492
sits down quietly for a second, looks at the lamp,
starts cleaning his fingernails a little bit,

01:35:54.492 --> 01:35:59.311
gives a big sigh, and turns off the light of the
lantern and exits the room,

01:35:59.311 --> 01:36:00.763
closing the door behind him.

01:36:00.763 --> 01:36:02.294
LIAM: Is it one floor, the building?

01:36:02.294 --> 01:36:03.233
MATT: It's one floor.

01:36:03.233 --> 01:36:05.642
LIAM: It's one floor. Is the window locked?

01:36:05.642 --> 01:36:09.448
MATT: You checked the window. It's not locked.

01:36:09.448 --> 01:36:10.829
LIAM: All right, I'm climbing in.

01:36:10.829 --> 01:36:13.939
MATT: You slip in without a problem. You've done
this many times before.

01:36:13.939 --> 01:36:20.292
LIAM: It's a family residence where Kynan lives.
Are there bedrooms?

01:36:20.292 --> 01:36:26.163
MATT: It's hard to tell, looking around the room
here. There are three doors that exit. One that he

01:36:26.163 --> 01:36:29.665
came through, which is apparently from the front
of the butcher shop. This appears to be a central

01:36:29.665 --> 01:36:32.918
room that connects to wherever else he walked.
There are two other doors.

01:36:32.918 --> 01:36:37.769
LIAM: They're not trapped, are they?

01:36:37.769 --> 01:36:41.008
MATT: They're not trapped.

01:36:41.008 --> 01:36:45.734
LIAM: So I'm going to crouch down and push open
the first door. What do I see?

01:36:45.734 --> 01:36:49.064
MATT: The door immediately right or the door in
front of you? The door in front of you is the one

01:36:49.064 --> 01:36:50.270
that the man traveled through.

01:36:50.270 --> 01:36:52.371
LIAM: Oh, no. Not that one. There were two other
doors, weren't there?

01:36:52.371 --> 01:36:56.021
MATT: There's the door that he came in from when
he sat down, and then he left through the door

01:36:56.021 --> 01:36:58.187
across the way from you, and there is a door that
been unopened.

01:36:58.187 --> 01:36:59.814
LIAM: There's one other door? That's the one.

01:36:59.814 --> 01:37:04.693
MATT: Okay. You push open the door very quietly.
It makes a little creaking sound, but you stop.

01:37:04.693 --> 01:37:11.858
Peering inside, it's dark. There appears to be a
bed. There's a small table. There's what looks

01:37:11.858 --> 01:37:17.766
like an old pair of boots that are worn out on the
side. It looks

01:37:17.766 --> 01:37:20.203
like a bedroom that nobody's currently in.

01:37:20.203 --> 01:37:28.207
LIAM: And there's no sign that this is a youth's
bedroom or father's bedroom? What can I glean from

01:37:28.207 --> 01:37:29.672
what I see in here?

01:37:29.672 --> 01:37:32.102
MATT: Make an investigation check.

01:37:32.102 --> 01:37:38.004
LIAM: I'm going to use Luck. That's better. 22.

01:37:38.004 --> 01:37:42.781
MATT: Okay. You take a little bit of time in
peering over the materials, looking at the bed

01:37:42.781 --> 01:37:48.049
size, looking at the boot size, looking at
whatever you can nearby. This bed is definitely

01:37:48.049 --> 01:37:54.228
weathered. It's been used for a long time. There
are a couple of small knick-knacks and toys that

01:37:54.228 --> 01:37:56.776
are discarded underneath that have been there for
a while that lead you to believe that this was at

01:37:56.776 --> 01:38:02.572
one point a boy's room. However, what you do
notice is that most of the materials, most of the

01:38:02.572 --> 01:38:06.528
belongings, anything that you would normally see
in a boy's room, anything that would say that a

01:38:06.528 --> 01:38:10.919
person lives here seem to have been hastily
grabbed and taken off.

01:38:10.919 --> 01:38:23.249
LIAM: And the father went out the other way? All
right, so I creep back out the window and I go out

01:38:23.249 --> 01:38:26.349
the front and I knock really loud on the front
door.

01:38:26.349 --> 01:38:31.842
MATT: A couple moments later, a voice comes from
the other side. "Hello?"

01:38:31.842 --> 01:38:35.919
LIAM: Hello. I'm sorry, I don't mean to bother
you. I know you've closed up shop.

01:38:35.919 --> 01:38:39.601
MATT: "I'm done for business for the day. Come
back tomorrow."

01:38:39.601 --> 01:38:46.236
LIAM: I'm actually not looking to buy anything. I
owe your son a bit of money. I lost some money in

01:38:46.236 --> 01:38:53.780
a wager we made on a dog fight, and I was hoping
to reimburse him. Do you know where he is?

01:38:53.780 --> 01:39:01.333
MATT: The door opens a little bit, and an eye
peeks through. You gather there's a slight scent

01:39:01.333 --> 01:39:05.694
of alcohol from the other side as he starts
talking. He says, "I don't know where my son's

01:39:05.694 --> 01:39:09.905
"gone off to. He came in in a huff. We got in an
argument. He grabbed his stuff and left. He does

01:39:09.905 --> 01:39:11.558
"this every now and then. He'll be back."

01:39:11.558 --> 01:39:13.718
LIAM: You think he'll be back?

01:39:13.718 --> 01:39:16.799
MATT: "This isn't the first time he's done this."

01:39:16.799 --> 01:39:21.986
LIAM: I want to leave something with you.

01:39:21.986 --> 01:39:24.670
MATT: "You said it was money you owed him?"

01:39:24.670 --> 01:39:27.502
LIAM: Yes.

01:39:27.502 --> 01:39:30.166
MATT: "I can give that to him."

01:39:30.166 --> 01:39:44.199
LIAM: I take 50 gold of what I have left and I
leave it with him, and I take out three daggers. I

01:39:44.199 --> 01:39:49.071
can hear my sister's voice in the back of my head.
I want to use insight on him to make sure he's

01:39:49.071 --> 01:39:53.522
trustworthy. Oh, that's good. That's 20.

01:39:53.522 --> 01:40:01.422
MATT: Okay. There's something about his face that
gives you the feeling that he's more interested in

01:40:01.422 --> 01:40:05.611
the contents of what you're leaving than actually
transferring these to the intended recipient.

01:40:05.611 --> 01:40:09.534
LIAM: Just give him the 50 gold. Thank you. And I
leave.

01:40:09.534 --> 01:40:14.612
MATT: Okay. Closes the door behind you, you hear a
lock. Light goes back out in the room.

01:40:14.612 --> 01:40:20.692
SAM: Go in there and kill him. Kill him, shit on
his bed, and leave.

01:40:20.692 --> 01:40:22.223
LIAM: I head back to the keep.

01:40:22.223 --> 01:40:27.863
MATT: Okay. All right, eventually Vax finds his
way back to the keep. The rest of you are there,

01:40:27.863 --> 01:40:30.584
at rest for the evening. Is there anything else
you want to accomplish before the night's out?

01:40:30.584 --> 01:40:33.742
MARISHA: I just flipped through my book on the
alchemy section for a bit.

01:40:33.742 --> 01:40:38.732
MATT: All right. You all find yourself to bed for
the evening, rest up for the next morning, and at

01:40:38.732 --> 01:40:41.793
that point we're going to go ahead and take our
break. Five minutes, guys, a strict five minutes

01:40:41.793 --> 01:40:45.490
because we still have a lot to get through. A lot
to get through tonight, don't want to stay late.

01:40:45.490 --> 01:40:47.050
LIAM: Another nine hours.

01:40:47.050 --> 01:40:52.506
MATT: No. See you guys in about five minutes,
quick restroom break. We'll be right back.

01:40:52.506 --> 01:55:12.918
[break]

01:55:12.918 --> 01:55:19.596
MATT: Welcome back, from our very strict, very
strict five-minute break. We're very good at that.

01:55:19.596 --> 01:55:26.194
Yeah. That's right. Couple quick things. First
off, we just hit 7,500 subscribers!

01:55:26.194 --> 01:55:29.008
(cheering)

01:55:29.008 --> 01:55:33.610
MATT: That's amazing for many reasons. But all of
you who are currently watching, be active in the

01:55:33.610 --> 01:55:37.239
chatroom so you can be included in the next
giveaway we're doing. Giveaway's going to include

01:55:37.239 --> 01:55:42.805
a signed picture of the cast, a signed poster by
the cast of the amazing art of our fantastic

01:55:42.805 --> 01:55:45.190
artist, Kit Buss.

01:55:45.190 --> 01:55:46.766
TALIESIN: Maybe signed by Kit.

01:55:46.766 --> 01:55:50.564
SAM: She's amazing.

01:55:50.564 --> 01:55:54.959
MATT: Yeah. So please be active in the chatroom,
be part of that giveaway when it gets put out, and

01:55:54.959 --> 01:55:58.218
thank you guys so much for being so amazing and
getting us to that point that's--

01:55:58.218 --> 01:56:02.224
LIAM: Yeah! You 7,500 people, fucking thank you,
man. Thank you.

01:56:02.224 --> 01:56:05.700
TRAVIS: But only you 7,500. The rest can fuck
off.

01:56:05.700 --> 01:56:17.226
MATT: That was in character. All right, cool.
Let's get back and see if we can, see if we can

01:56:17.226 --> 01:56:25.388
roll through some of this stuff. As you wake the
next morning, you guys awaken to the dull sound of

01:56:25.388 --> 01:56:31.499
metal clanging as Percy has already been the first
to wake and is back in the workshop. Tiberius,

01:56:31.499 --> 01:56:36.169
you're well-rested. Everyone's spells have
returned. You get to make a beard roll.

01:56:36.169 --> 01:56:41.657
TRAVIS: Beard check, please! Three. Five.

01:56:41.657 --> 01:56:47.728
MATT: 35? What? Bundlesofkittens, by the way, won.
Congratulations to bundlesofkittens.

01:56:47.728 --> 01:56:52.337
Going to get prizes.

01:56:52.337 --> 01:56:54.461
LAURA: Adorable.

01:56:54.461 --> 01:57:00.872
MATT: 35% does count. As you wake up, you reach up
and feel the return of a nice hefty bit of scruff

01:57:00.872 --> 01:57:07.390
to your chin. Yeah, it's getting pretty thick now.
It's a good, like, half an inch to an inch length.

01:57:07.390 --> 01:57:14.170
And you're starting to get a little, you notice
the first time you grew some facial hair it was

01:57:14.170 --> 01:57:18.384
coming through that weird, creepy translucent
color? It's starting to come through with a

01:57:18.384 --> 01:57:24.911
proper, almost a dark red-brown color to it.

01:57:24.911 --> 01:57:26.008
TRAVIS: What?

01:57:26.008 --> 01:57:28.091
MARISHA: Got a little bit of the Irish thing going
on.

01:57:28.091 --> 01:57:31.941
TRAVIS: I don't know, I might have to get a cage;
the women are going to come running.

01:57:31.941 --> 01:57:39.259
MATT: So as you all gather for breakfast, you get
your fill, a fine breakfast awaits you, already

01:57:39.259 --> 01:57:43.664
prepared by your servants of the Greyskull Keep.
What do you wish to do?

01:57:43.664 --> 01:57:49.552
TRAVIS: Good morning, Vox Machina. Lovely to see
all of you.

01:57:49.552 --> 01:57:54.519
MARISHA: So Grog, you fell asleep in your plate of
food and woke up with a beard.

01:57:54.519 --> 01:57:56.739
TRAVIS: I know. Some guys are just lucky.

01:57:56.739 --> 01:57:59.278
(laughter)

01:57:59.278 --> 01:58:01.222
TALIESIN: Have we checked to make sure it's not a
stain?

01:58:01.222 --> 01:58:04.767
TRAVIS: Hey, fuck off with your stinging, burning
shit, all right? I'm not putting anything else in

01:58:04.767 --> 01:58:11.327
water. I don't know if you know, Scanlan, but
water burns.

01:58:11.327 --> 01:58:14.876
LAURA: Good job, Percy, now he's never going to
bathe.

01:58:14.876 --> 01:58:17.722
TALIESIN: You may have taken the wrong lesson away
from that.

01:58:17.722 --> 01:58:22.105
TRAVIS: No, I pretty much got it. In, burn, ouch,
powder.

01:58:22.105 --> 01:58:30.025
ORION: You're not a chinchilla, Grog, which is a
small creature that bathes itself in dust. But you

01:58:30.025 --> 01:58:33.115
are a human, which water is good.

01:58:33.115 --> 01:58:34.402
TRAVIS: I'm not a human.

01:58:34.402 --> 01:58:41.434
ORION: Well, you are a humanoid. Which is, water
is good. Which, most of you is water.

01:58:41.434 --> 01:58:44.661
TRAVIS: (gasps) You always drink water when we
drink. Does it burn?

01:58:44.661 --> 01:58:46.614
ORION: No, it feels rather--

01:58:46.614 --> 01:58:47.822
SAM: Let's get going.

01:58:47.822 --> 01:58:49.455
TALIESIN: He does breathe fire.

01:58:49.455 --> 01:58:52.362
ORION: I'm feeding Lockheed some of my breakfast.

01:58:52.362 --> 01:58:59.721
MATT: Certainly. Lockheed enjoys the breakfast.
Lockheed is looking healthier. The color is a

01:58:59.721 --> 01:59:03.803
little more of a deep emerald green, and he
appears to have

01:59:03.803 --> 01:59:05.565
a little more energy this morning.

01:59:05.565 --> 01:59:11.089
SAM: Does it shit on your shoulder?

01:59:11.089 --> 01:59:21.638
MATT: He hasn't noticed, but there is a slight
streak of dried pseudo-dragon poo. You're not

01:59:21.638 --> 01:59:23.354
aware of it to cast that yet.

01:59:23.354 --> 01:59:26.174
TALIESIN: Methinks the DM doth speak from
experience.

01:59:26.174 --> 01:59:29.268
MATT: As a bird owner, he does.

01:59:29.268 --> 01:59:34.989
ORION: I'm going to, I rolled, I'm going to do a
roll for the day, I think I rolled one for the

01:59:34.989 --> 01:59:41.687
day, and I'm going to go: Staht. Staht. And I'm
going to,

01:59:41.687 --> 01:59:44.660
I rolled a 14 to try to teach it to sit. Staht.

01:59:44.660 --> 01:59:50.575
MATT: (lizard noises) It sits down on the edge of
the table.

01:59:50.575 --> 02:00:00.722
ORION: And I give it a treat. Krar, Krar, there
you go.

02:00:00.722 --> 02:00:02.435
MATT: Bites your finger.

02:00:02.435 --> 02:00:04.488
ORION: As it's hanging, I put it on my shoulder.

02:00:04.488 --> 02:00:06.613
MATT: (lizard noises) It sits there.

02:00:06.613 --> 02:00:09.715
MARISHA: They get nippy. It's in the breed.

02:00:09.715 --> 02:00:11.798
MATT: So! What do you want to do?

02:00:11.798 --> 02:00:16.553
SAM: We want to get out of here. Cast the thing.
Let's go.

02:00:16.768 --> 02:00:22.011
ORION: As I'm having my oatmeal and such, I start
to cast.

02:00:22.011 --> 02:00:28.202
MARISHA: I still think maybe the more talkative
members of the group should go?

02:00:28.202 --> 02:00:30.404
SAM: Still want to split the party?

02:00:30.404 --> 02:00:33.105
TALIESIN: I'm staying home, anyway

02:00:33.105 --> 02:00:35.731
MARISHA: I'm checking in with Tiberius-- oh sorry,
Percy.

02:00:35.731 --> 02:00:40.025
MATT: At which point the teleportation sigil
appears in the center of the floor the way

02:00:40.025 --> 02:00:42.125
Tiberius had prepared it. It's glowing right now.

02:00:42.125 --> 02:00:44.338
TRAVIS: I've got the creature bits so I should go,
too.

02:00:44.338 --> 02:00:46.929
LAURA: You! Take care of my bear, I'm leaving him
here with you.

02:00:46.929 --> 02:00:48.269
LIAM: All right. I got him.

02:00:48.269 --> 02:00:51.524
LAURA: Oh, Trinket! I love you so.

02:00:51.524 --> 02:00:53.875
MATT: Trinket comes up and like rubs his nose
against your coat.

02:00:53.875 --> 02:00:55.204
LAURA: Behave, all right?

02:00:55.204 --> 02:00:57.588
LIAM: I'm going to feed you so much chocolate.

02:00:57.588 --> 02:00:59.758
LAURA: That's really bad for him! Don't!

02:00:59.758 --> 02:01:01.096
MARISHA: It'll be fine.

02:01:01.096 --> 02:01:03.453
MATT: The sigil's starting to spark--

02:01:03.453 --> 02:01:04.862
SAM: I jump in.

02:01:04.862 --> 02:01:06.055
TRAVIS: I jump in, too.

02:01:06.055 --> 02:01:10.434
MATT: Okay, so all of you who are going, you leap
in. You're staying and you're staying, correct?

02:01:10.434 --> 02:01:15.279
And you're staying. All right, Keyleth, Percy and
Vax. All of you guys step in and all of a sudden

02:01:15.279 --> 02:01:19.545
there's a familiar whoosh of some sort of dark
transference, you feel as if gravity for a moment

02:01:19.712 --> 02:01:26.181
doesn't exist and your feet find purchase on some
sort of a wooden floor. The room is dark. You

02:01:26.181 --> 02:01:30.632
glance about the immediate vicinity, and for those
of you who have low light, there's very little you

02:01:30.632 --> 02:01:34.951
can actually make out other than the fact this is
a basement of some kind, and you are amidst a

02:01:34.951 --> 02:01:36.989
bunch of sheet covered crates.

02:01:36.989 --> 02:01:38.713
ORION: Light! (whoosh)

02:01:38.713 --> 02:01:40.931
MATT: As the light fills the room, you look
around.

02:01:40.931 --> 02:01:42.870
ORION: I cast it on Lockheed. On his tail.

02:01:42.870 --> 02:01:47.061
MATT: All right! Lockheed begins trying to shake
the light off the tail,

02:01:47.061 --> 02:01:48.477
so it moves around a little bit.

02:01:48.477 --> 02:01:57.718
ORION: Oh, Bensvelk! That means "good" in
Draconian. Bensvelk. And I feed him a treat.

02:01:57.718 --> 02:02:03.185
MATT: (chuckles) All right! You look around the
room, there are about six or seven of these crates

02:02:03.185 --> 02:02:06.558
immediately visible to you. They have sheets put
over them, they're different sizes, some sort of

02:02:06.558 --> 02:02:09.731
storage room. There is a staircase that leads to
the floor above.

02:02:09.731 --> 02:02:17.344
LAURA: Wait. Do they know we're coming? We're just
in the middle of their home now?

02:02:17.344 --> 02:02:23.377
ORION: Yes, of course, Vex, they know we're
coming. I showed them the amulet, it was how we

02:02:23.377 --> 02:02:26.563
got the sigil to come here to begin with. It's
fine. We're doing business with them.

02:02:26.563 --> 02:02:28.755
It'll be good.

02:02:28.755 --> 02:02:35.220
LAURA: Can I perception and make sure there's no
traps around us? Just to make sure. We're just

02:02:35.220 --> 02:02:43.986
popping in, and this is a magic house, am I right? So
I can't check for traps worth shit.

02:02:43.986 --> 02:02:45.345
MATT: Room looks safe!

02:02:45.345 --> 02:02:47.119
LAURA: Great. Good. Great.

02:02:47.119 --> 02:02:48.709
TRAVIS: Well, good. Let's get out of here.

02:02:48.709 --> 02:02:55.851
MATT: All right. You guys make your way to the
second floor. As you step up to the top you can

02:02:55.851 --> 02:03:02.501
see there is light emanating from the top of the
staircase and a figure moves into the staircase. A

02:03:02.501 --> 02:03:14.481
stout dwarven figure. This is the same individual
you spoke to previously. The dwarf steps to the

02:03:14.481 --> 02:03:21.892
top and says, with an air of annoyance to the
voice. "All right. Waited up all night for you to

02:03:21.892 --> 02:03:25.508
"arrive, and you never did. And you come here and
interrupt my breakfast."

02:03:25.508 --> 02:03:30.906
ORION: I'm sorry. We thought you would like a
night's sleep before we intrude and--

02:03:30.906 --> 02:03:36.268
MATT: "It's fine, step up the stairs, please." and
he steps out of the way, leads you into the

02:03:36.268 --> 02:03:45.122
central chamber. This house is unfamiliar to all
but Scanlan, who turned invisible suddenly and

02:03:45.122 --> 02:03:46.802
decided to wander in briefly.

02:03:46.802 --> 02:03:50.003
SAM: Yes, I did. My old stomping grounds.

02:03:50.003 --> 02:03:58.676
MATT: The classic "I don't know!" Looking about
it's very well-kept. It's an old house; the

02:03:58.676 --> 02:04:03.191
ceilings are taller than you expect for a dwarf
type home. A lot of the ceilings are a little low

02:04:03.191 --> 02:04:11.663
especially for you Grog, this one's built roomy.
There's actually a lot of cultivated cave plant

02:04:11.663 --> 02:04:19.568
life, a lot of boxes that contain various
underground dwelling plants and other such

02:04:19.568 --> 02:04:25.232
funguses. The air itself is mixtures of sweet and
pungent. Mixed almost as if there's a spice garden

02:04:25.232 --> 02:04:29.071
somewhere, and you're not really able to take a
beat on what the actual interior would smell like,

02:04:29.071 --> 02:04:37.607
it keeps changing around you. You're brought to
the main foyer area, and the dwarf turns back and

02:04:37.607 --> 02:04:42.528
he says "All right, you've made your transference.
Where's the amulet?"

02:04:42.528 --> 02:04:53.284
ORION: I'll open the Bag of Holding. And I'll take
it out. Before I actually go over and speak, I'm

02:04:53.284 --> 02:05:00.165
going to turn to Scanlan and Vex. Is he the same
person who pays us for the other--

02:05:00.165 --> 02:05:04.667
LAURA: No. I should probably go find that guy. Or
we can go all together.

02:05:04.667 --> 02:05:06.905
ORION: I just didn't want to say the wrong thing
this time.

02:05:06.905 --> 02:05:08.839
SAM: Sure, don't worry. You will.

02:05:08.839 --> 02:05:21.319
ORION: Oh, sorry. Here is the amulet. And I show
him. Now, as far as trade, as it was rather taxing

02:05:21.319 --> 02:05:23.547
to procure this particular artifact--

02:05:23.547 --> 02:05:25.474
LAURA: Incredibly difficult, he means to say.

02:05:25.474 --> 02:05:34.656
ORION: Yes, she's correct. I was wondering if we
could, perchance, trade it for a favor of your

02:05:34.656 --> 02:05:36.432
arcane ability?

02:05:36.432 --> 02:05:41.747
MATT: "It's funny, because I already did. I gave
you a permanent entry to my own household, my

02:05:41.747 --> 02:05:47.850
"family's household, by offering you this sigil,
that gave you entrance to the interior of our

02:05:47.850 --> 02:05:52.721
"well-guarded estate. That was a trade enough. That
was what we agreed upon through the mirror."

02:05:52.721 --> 02:05:54.615
ORION: That was just to get me here quicker, I
thought.

02:05:54.615 --> 02:05:56.850
MATT: "So you come into my home and try to extort
me?"

02:05:56.850 --> 02:06:06.771
ORION: No, not at all! Here's what happened, see.
We were on an adventure-- I pull out the carpet

02:06:06.771 --> 02:06:14.555
out of my Bag of Holding. And this carpet was
enchanted once with the ability to fly, and it

02:06:14.555 --> 02:06:22.939
helped us many times in many adventures. It was
de-chanted, I guess, if you want to say it. And we

02:06:22.939 --> 02:06:29.611
need it re-chanted. And I thought that House
Thunderbrand would be a strong enough house to

02:06:29.611 --> 02:06:34.305
have the ability to do such a thing. Maybe not as
it seems.

02:06:34.305 --> 02:06:36.285
And I hand him the amulet as I'm saying this.

02:06:36.285 --> 02:06:37.626
MATT: He takes the amulet.

02:06:37.626 --> 02:06:43.156
ORION: And not as a trade, but as a favor for just
the effort, or maybe because I'm not strong enough

02:06:43.156 --> 02:06:44.814
as a sorcerer myself to do it.

02:06:44.814 --> 02:06:46.459
MATT: Make a persuasion roll.

02:06:46.459 --> 02:06:51.012
LAURA: People speak very, very highly of your
abilities. Can I assist him?

02:06:51.012 --> 02:07:02.724
MATT: It's not going to matter. You keep talking,
and as you're explaining this, he's not even

02:07:02.724 --> 02:07:09.204
paying attention to you. The dwarf is staring at
the amulet, looking at the back of it where the

02:07:09.204 --> 02:07:15.995
inscription is. And you swear for a minute, you
see what looks like a tear, gathering in the

02:07:15.995 --> 02:07:21.021
corner of the eye of the dwarf, who then reaches
up and wipes it from the corner and takes the

02:07:21.021 --> 02:07:26.954
amulet and puts it in the pocket and says, "My
apologies. Thank you for returning this. You were

02:07:26.954 --> 02:07:28.878
"talking about the carpet, right?"

02:07:28.878 --> 02:07:30.462
LAURA and ORION: Yes.

02:07:30.462 --> 02:07:32.253
MATT: "You want it to be enchanted?"

02:07:32.253 --> 02:07:38.724
LAURA: Well, we've heard very wonderful things
about your abilities and not many people can do

02:07:38.724 --> 02:07:39.671
such a feat.

02:07:39.671 --> 02:07:42.773
MATT: "We have done a carpet before. Only one.
It's very possible."

02:07:42.773 --> 02:07:45.513
LAURA: Did it look anything like this one?

02:07:45.513 --> 02:07:54.067
MATT: "Not this pattern, no, that one was more of
a blue. I mean this can be enchanted, but the

02:07:54.067 --> 02:07:57.086
"materials and the time put into it-- It's a very
pricey endeavor.

02:07:57.086 --> 02:07:58.986
"A carpet of this size, especially."

02:07:58.986 --> 02:08:00.287
SAM: How much?

02:08:00.287 --> 02:08:11.228
MATT: "We're looking at the better part of a year
to enchant this and that'll cost you about, time

02:08:11.228 --> 02:08:13.454
"included, that'll cost 50,000 gold pieces."

02:08:13.454 --> 02:08:24.544
LAURA: Oh my god! I throw my hands up. I just
can't. I just can't! How did we not? Oh my god.

02:08:24.544 --> 02:08:26.142
SAM: She's very fond of the carpet.

02:08:26.142 --> 02:08:28.598
TRAVIS: I put my arm around Vex and try and
console her.

02:08:28.598 --> 02:08:33.943
LAURA: 50? A year! Why?! Thank you so much.

02:08:33.943 --> 02:08:36.187
MATT: "Well I mean, there might be smaller ones
you might be able to find elsewhere."

02:08:36.187 --> 02:08:40.231
LAURA: No, I know it's a really beautiful carpet,
and it would cost a lot of

02:08:40.231 --> 02:08:41.880
money to fix up, I understand.

02:08:41.880 --> 02:08:45.021
SAM: She loves the hand-woven carpets. It's just
very tragic.

02:08:45.021 --> 02:08:46.871
MATT: "All right, well--"

02:08:46.871 --> 02:08:49.959
TRAVIS: Shall we go get our money now?

02:08:49.959 --> 02:08:52.425
SAM: Yes, who's the man we need to see about
that?

02:08:52.425 --> 02:08:55.449
LAURA: Oh, that's the Kraghammer-- We go to see--

02:08:55.449 --> 02:08:56.779
LIAM: Johnny Kraghammer?

02:08:56.779 --> 02:08:58.531
LAURA: Johnny Kraghammer.

02:08:58.531 --> 02:09:01.326
SAM: Nostoc Greyspine?

02:09:01.326 --> 02:09:03.276
LAURA: It was Greyspine.

02:09:03.276 --> 02:09:08.862
MATT: Nostoc Greyspine. You're escorted out of the
House Thunderbrand. Make your way down to the

02:09:08.862 --> 02:09:14.622
quarry, at the very bottom level of Kraghammer,
once again. It's been a long time since you've

02:09:14.622 --> 02:09:19.691
been in this portion of the world, let alone this
city, where you started this leg of your entire

02:09:19.691 --> 02:09:35.700
journey. You do make your way down into this area
to Lord Nostoc Greyspine's proper office, the one

02:09:35.700 --> 02:09:43.645
where you managed to procure his expensive wine
and make this venture the very beginning. You step

02:09:43.645 --> 02:09:47.573
into the familiar halls. As soon as you enter, you
have a brief discussion with the guy at the front,

02:09:47.573 --> 02:09:52.081
who recognizes you and leads you into the office.
There, waiting, behind his desk is Nostoc, who's

02:09:52.081 --> 02:09:58.200
currently in the process of looking out the window
over the entire quarry of his mine. He turns over

02:09:58.200 --> 02:09:59.651
his shoulder, looking at the rest of you.

02:09:59.651 --> 02:10:08.149
"Well, I'm surprised to see you all alive.
Just assumed you'd all got yourselves killed, like

02:10:08.149 --> 02:10:11.783
"the usual bumpkins who come wandering this far
down in the mountain."

02:10:11.783 --> 02:10:22.856
LAURA: No. We did not die. We, in fact, succeeded
in taking care of those creatures.

02:10:22.856 --> 02:10:25.888
Under-- dark-- carpet.

02:10:25.888 --> 02:10:30.123
SAM: She's-- That time of the month.

02:10:30.123 --> 02:10:38.084
LAURA: Oh! Excuse me. We came to collect the money
you owed us for completing

02:10:38.084 --> 02:10:39.739
the mission you sent us on.

02:10:39.739 --> 02:10:44.761
MATT: "Ah yes, of course. Of course. Understood.
What was the price we had agreed for that one?"

02:10:44.761 --> 02:10:53.513
LAURA: Oh, it was 30,000 gold, plus all the extras
for the scalps that we acquired.

02:10:53.513 --> 02:10:57.761
TRAVIS: I open the bag of holding and go, Here,
here's one brain chunk.

02:10:57.761 --> 02:10:59.329
And I dump it on the floor.

02:10:59.329 --> 02:11:06.123
MATT: As a note, I'm pretty sure at practically no
point in your adventure to the Underdark did you

02:11:06.123 --> 02:11:09.083
ever say you were scalping a creature.

02:11:09.083 --> 02:11:10.812
LIAM: We're above base--

02:11:10.812 --> 02:11:14.560
MARISHA: We totally forgot about that.

02:11:14.560 --> 02:11:17.895
MATT: You completely, in the entirety of that
adventure, didn't collect a single scalp from

02:11:17.895 --> 02:11:19.299
anything you killed.

02:11:19.299 --> 02:11:28.271
TRAVIS: I thought I grabbed the brain chunk. I
thought I grabbed an arm, too. There was just an

02:11:28.271 --> 02:11:30.897
arm from the stitched guy, and I just grabbed it.

02:11:30.897 --> 02:11:35.026
LIAM: An arm is not a scalp. It's this.

02:11:35.026 --> 02:11:43.975
MATT: Nostoc also looks at you and goes, "And
while I respect your memory, a dwarf's mind is

02:11:43.975 --> 02:11:51.257
"like a trap that you can't escape. I believe the
agreed upon price was 25,000 gold pieces."

02:11:51.257 --> 02:11:53.813
LAURA: Oh it was? That is so weird, I remember
30.

02:11:53.813 --> 02:11:59.342
MATT: "I don't even know what you fought. If
you're going to collect your money, tell me what

02:11:59.342 --> 02:12:01.241
"the hell you freaking killed."

02:12:01.241 --> 02:12:05.052
LAURA: Mind flayers! A beholder! Have you heard of
a beholder?

02:12:05.052 --> 02:12:06.479
MATT: "You fought a beholder?"

02:12:06.479 --> 02:12:08.521
LAURA: We fought a fucking beholder.

02:12:08.521 --> 02:12:11.390
MATT: "Really? And you're all still alive?"

02:12:11.390 --> 02:12:15.797
SAM: Well no, not all of us. If you'll recall
there were more of us when we came down here. And

02:12:15.797 --> 02:12:18.527
some of us aren't here because they died.

02:12:18.527 --> 02:12:20.593
TRAVIS: I start pretending to cry.

02:12:20.593 --> 02:12:22.181
MATT: Make a deception check.

02:12:22.181 --> 02:12:24.079
LAURA: That's really good.

02:12:24.079 --> 02:12:26.295
SAM: 21.

02:12:26.295 --> 02:12:32.995
LAURA: I start thinking about the carpet and I
really do start crying.

02:12:32.995 --> 02:12:37.226
SAM: So before you berate us, know that we are
mourning the loss of two of our members.

02:12:37.226 --> 02:12:39.197
And a bear!

02:12:39.197 --> 02:12:41.472
LAURA: (sobbing) And my bear!

02:12:41.472 --> 02:12:43.981
MATT: "Beholder, you say?"

02:12:43.981 --> 02:12:45.677
LAURA: It was really big.

02:12:45.677 --> 02:12:50.097
MATT: "What else did you encounter?"

02:12:50.097 --> 02:12:51.294
LAURA: Illithid.

02:12:51.294 --> 02:12:55.148
SAM: Lots of illithid. A whole city of illithid.

02:12:55.148 --> 02:12:57.050
MATT: "A whole city of illithid?"

02:12:57.050 --> 02:13:01.175
LAURA: We destroyed half of an elder brain-- Part
of an elder brain.

02:13:01.175 --> 02:13:03.297
TRAVIS: And there were all these dark--

02:13:03.297 --> 02:13:08.141
LAURA: Dwarves! There were dark dwarves. Duergar.

02:13:08.141 --> 02:13:17.671
SAM: They were mind controlled. It was crazy,
we're not just making this up.

02:13:17.671 --> 02:13:19.333
It really happened.

02:13:19.333 --> 02:13:23.963
TRAVIS: There were these wrinkled testicles that
were walking around on feet.

02:13:23.963 --> 02:13:26.668
LAURA: He almost died! Just from this one little
brain.

02:13:26.668 --> 02:13:31.391
TRAVIS: Strange thing. If you're stupid, and it
looks at you with its wrinkled testicle face?

02:13:31.391 --> 02:13:34.415
You go unconscious.

02:13:34.415 --> 02:13:38.054
MATT: "I know the creatures you speak of. I've
dealt with my share of duergar, though--"

02:13:38.054 --> 02:13:41.867
ORION: I completely stayed away from it, because I
was terrified.

02:13:41.867 --> 02:13:43.975
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

02:13:43.975 --> 02:13:46.843
LIAM: (singing) Roll high!

02:13:46.843 --> 02:13:50.786
LAURA: Are we all rolling? Because we're all
talking.

02:13:50.786 --> 02:13:52.785
MATT: You were spearheading that part of the
group.

02:13:52.785 --> 02:13:54.248
LAURA: I was? I thought Scanlan was.

02:13:54.248 --> 02:13:55.862
MATT: Scanlan already made his roll.

02:13:55.862 --> 02:13:58.255
TRAVIS: What about giving her advantage because I
was talking about testicles?

02:13:58.255 --> 02:14:01.730
MATT: No testicle advantage on that roll. I'm
sorry.

02:14:01.730 --> 02:14:05.482
LIAM: In what circumstance would testicle
advantage come into play?

02:14:05.482 --> 02:14:07.996
SAM: At Gilmore's.

02:14:07.996 --> 02:14:10.359
LAURA: That would be 11.

02:14:10.359 --> 02:14:22.252
MATT: 11? "Looking at your number, I can see that
you've certainly encountered some dangerous things

02:14:22.252 --> 02:14:28.166
"in your travels, taken some losses. And I will
say, since you've left, we haven't had at least

02:14:28.166 --> 02:14:34.055
"one excursion interrupting our mine, which has
been very helpful. The fact that you've returned

02:14:34.055 --> 02:14:41.947
"with these tales-- I believe most of it. I'd say,
given that circumstance, I'd be happy to pay you

02:14:41.947 --> 02:14:45.515
"up to 18,000 gold pieces."

02:14:45.515 --> 02:14:49.073
SAM: I am going to cast Suggestion on him.

02:14:49.073 --> 02:14:52.212
LAURA: 18,000 gold in addition to the--

02:14:52.212 --> 02:14:53.454
TRAVIS: He's casting.

02:14:53.454 --> 02:14:55.025
LIAM: He's doing it!

02:14:55.025 --> 02:14:59.290
MATT: So what's the DC? You don't have your hand
cone.

02:14:59.290 --> 02:15:02.072
SAM: I don't have my hand cone out. 17.

02:15:02.072 --> 02:15:05.488
MATT: Natural one.

02:15:05.488 --> 02:15:09.637
LAURA: Money!

02:15:09.637 --> 02:15:11.709
MATT: All right, what are you suggesting?

02:15:11.709 --> 02:15:16.073
SAM: I'm going to suggest to him that he is an
honorable man and we had a deal. And that he

02:15:16.073 --> 02:15:21.252
should honor it, to the fullest extent of the
word.

02:15:21.252 --> 02:15:23.343
MATT: He looks about at the rest of you guys.

02:15:23.343 --> 02:15:33.994
SAM: I also, as a cantrip-- oh god, I hope it's
not concentration. Forget it. I'm not going to.

02:15:33.994 --> 02:15:44.144
MATT: "The Greyspine name holds weight in this
city, the last thing I want is that that be

02:15:44.144 --> 02:15:56.401
"sullied by miscommunication. If we agreed to
25,000, I'll pay 25,000. But I hear a single

02:15:56.401 --> 02:16:05.997
"disagreement out there, or a bad word that came
from your lips about our exchange here, and I'm

02:16:05.997 --> 02:16:07.788
"going to come for the rest of that money."

02:16:07.788 --> 02:16:10.352
TRAVIS: I hold up the duergar's severed arm, and I
curl all the fingers in

02:16:10.352 --> 02:16:13.291
and make a thumbs-up like that.

02:16:13.291 --> 02:16:25.893
MATT: He looks back at you, very slowly, as you do
this, with a tense stare. (laughs) "All right, all

02:16:25.893 --> 02:16:30.143
"right." And he starts bringing up coin purse,
after coin purse, after coin purse, counting it up

02:16:30.143 --> 02:16:35.167
as he does. It takes him about five minutes or so,
and eventually he counts out, at your vision to

02:16:35.167 --> 02:16:42.100
improve it, 25,000 gold pieces and platinum pieces
and pushes it across to you guys. You've retrieved

02:16:42.100 --> 02:16:46.068
that. No additional funds, as no scalps were
collected, but you do get 25,000.

02:16:46.068 --> 02:16:47.563
TRAVIS: Do you want the--

02:16:47.563 --> 02:16:50.960
MATT: "You can hold onto that, thank you."

02:16:50.960 --> 02:16:53.280
TRAVIS: You're very gracious.

02:16:53.280 --> 02:17:03.352
LAURA: (singing) 25,000 gold in my hands right
now. Thank you so much. This won't make up for the

02:17:03.352 --> 02:17:10.159
lost lives we have suffered, but-- (choking up) It
helps.

02:17:10.159 --> 02:17:22.731
MATT: "I'm glad. And I'm sorry for your losses.
Perhaps you'll be less stupid in the future."

02:17:22.731 --> 02:17:24.288
TRAVIS: Probably not. We should go.

02:17:24.288 --> 02:17:28.982
SAM: Remember the blood we spilled for your people
and your safety.

02:17:28.982 --> 02:17:30.394
LAURA: Vox Machina!

02:17:30.394 --> 02:17:34.023
(laughter)

02:17:34.023 --> 02:17:38.093
SAM: Oh! I go to give him a business card, but
then I realize I never got them printed so.

02:17:38.093 --> 02:17:42.271
LAURA: Also! Gilmore's Glorious Goods! Great
work.

02:17:42.271 --> 02:17:48.181
SAM: Yes, Gilmore's! If you're ever overdark, come
check it out. It's a great store.

02:17:48.181 --> 02:17:53.465
MATT: Like an unexpected web pop-up, he gives you
an expression of: where is this coming from?

02:17:53.465 --> 02:17:55.975
"Get out! Get out of my office!"

02:17:55.975 --> 02:18:01.205
TRAVIS: Tiberius, how do we get out of here
quickly?

02:18:01.205 --> 02:18:04.732
ORION: I start going back to the chamber and I'll
do the spell again.

02:18:04.732 --> 02:18:07.120
SAM: Can you do it again? Don't you have to rest?

02:18:07.120 --> 02:18:10.585
MATT: You can do it twice? 6th-level spell twice?

02:18:10.585 --> 02:18:12.612
ORION: No it's a 5th-level spell.

02:18:12.612 --> 02:18:14.021
MATT: What? The teleportation?

02:18:14.021 --> 02:18:15.799
ORION: Yeah, it's a 5th-level spell.

02:18:15.799 --> 02:18:17.215
MATT: I think it is. You're right.

02:18:17.215 --> 02:18:26.852
ORION: Yes, very well. And then we'll go back to--
I'll choose Emon.

02:18:26.852 --> 02:18:38.730
LIAM: Excuse me? As soon as they left, Trinket and
I, we left, and I went to the nearest shop and

02:18:38.730 --> 02:18:45.231
bought a lot of pink ribbon, and I have been
furiously tying bows all through Trinket's hair,

02:18:45.231 --> 02:18:48.229
the entire time they've been gone.

02:18:48.229 --> 02:18:55.357
MARISHA: Actually I'll help with that campaign. I
do some braids, and add some flowers.

02:18:55.357 --> 02:19:02.487
LIAM: Keyleth has been weaving flowers in, and I
have been knotting braids. Started at the head,

02:19:02.487 --> 02:19:07.154
and then worked all the way down Trinket's back
and down the tail. The entire time. Feverishly.

02:19:07.154 --> 02:19:11.504
TALIESIN: I come up for lunch. Keyleth, can I
borrow you for a-- what in good god?!

02:19:11.504 --> 02:19:17.530
MARISHA: Is it important? Do you need me right
now? This is pretty important.

02:19:17.530 --> 02:19:19.277
TALIESIN: Is Trinket comfortable with this?

02:19:19.277 --> 02:19:24.482
MARISHA: He's so comfortable! Look, I gave him
plenty of treats, he doesn't even know what's

02:19:24.482 --> 02:19:25.803
happening.

02:19:25.803 --> 02:19:31.255
MATT: (sad bear noises) This mournful low,
guttural groan. You're pretty sure it translates

02:19:31.255 --> 02:19:34.820
to, "Why?"

02:19:34.820 --> 02:19:37.951
LIAM: I feed him a piece of chocolate at that
moment.

02:19:37.951 --> 02:19:39.777
LAURA: Don't give him chocolate!

02:19:39.777 --> 02:19:41.453
MATT: He licks it off.

02:19:41.453 --> 02:19:46.303
TALIESIN: Keyleth, can I borrow you? When you have
a moment.

02:19:46.303 --> 02:19:52.579
MARISHA: Ten more minutes. I'll be down in ten
minutes.

02:19:52.579 --> 02:19:56.380
MATT: It takes about ten minutes before the keep
doors open and the rest of your party returns.

02:19:56.380 --> 02:19:58.667
MARISHA: And I run downstairs really fast.

02:19:58.667 --> 02:20:06.465
LIAM: Side note, I let Trinket give me bear-kisses
all over my face. Vex never lets Trinket kiss her

02:20:06.465 --> 02:20:12.568
face, and it's so sad, and I let him just drool
all over my face everywhere.

02:20:12.568 --> 02:20:17.107
TALIESIN: I feel like we're playing out some
real-world psychodrama here.

02:20:17.107 --> 02:20:25.477
ORION: As this is going on, I want to turn to
Scanlan and go, Gnome. I have an idea that I want

02:20:25.477 --> 02:20:38.864
to run by you. No, your name's Scanlan. Okay. I
was going to go and do this, just on a whim as I

02:20:38.864 --> 02:20:47.217
usually do, but I was thinking that we should
speak to Allura, and I don't think I should speak

02:20:47.217 --> 02:20:48.362
to her alone.

02:20:48.362 --> 02:20:53.776
SAM: I'm sorry. I must be asleep. Are you planning
something? Ahead of time.

02:20:53.776 --> 02:20:54.992
ORION: Yes.

02:20:54.992 --> 02:20:57.428
SAM: Wow. That's amazing!

02:20:57.428 --> 02:21:04.446
ORION: You know. Like I told Vax, you just have to
chill out sometimes, and I'm like, well, maybe I

02:21:04.446 --> 02:21:08.583
should run it by the man with the mouth.

02:21:08.583 --> 02:21:17.342
SAM: Well, you've come to the right place. I do
have quite a mouth. Yes, let's go talk to her.

02:21:17.342 --> 02:21:21.230
Wait, she's the woman you fancy quite a bit, isn't
that true?

02:21:21.230 --> 02:21:26.118
ORION: Yes. This is more business rather than
denied pleasure.

02:21:26.118 --> 02:21:28.948
SAM: What do you want to speak with her about?

02:21:28.948 --> 02:21:34.187
ORION: Well, as far as I see it, there's no other
way to get our carpet reenchanted. I want to

02:21:34.187 --> 02:21:41.436
confess what we did to her, and hopefully she
takes mercy and helps us out with this, as we've

02:21:41.436 --> 02:21:43.282
helped her out far beyond anything that--

02:21:43.282 --> 02:21:47.683
MATT: At this point in the discussion, you guys
all look up and see, sitting in the center of the

02:21:47.683 --> 02:21:56.934
main foyer area of Greyskull, a very mighty bear,
brought down low, sitting covered in pink ribbons,

02:21:56.934 --> 02:22:01.243
looking forward, going (distressed bear noises)

02:22:01.243 --> 02:22:03.207
SAM: See? I told you it was a girl!

02:22:03.207 --> 02:22:07.204
LAURA: Trinket! You look so cute.

02:22:07.204 --> 02:22:09.061
MARISHA: Oh, I knew she'd love it!

02:22:09.061 --> 02:22:15.090
LAURA: We need to get these off of you
immediately. But you look really, really cute. And

02:22:15.090 --> 02:22:19.388
I scratch his little ears. How dare--

02:22:19.388 --> 02:22:25.567
MATT: You look over, too, there are traces of
chocolate smears across the face of Vax.

02:22:25.567 --> 02:22:37.604
ORION: Vex. No, Vex. Yes. Stand over-- and I use
my Still Image and take a little spell of her--

02:22:37.604 --> 02:22:39.400
TALIESIN: Say it. Staffie. Just say staffie.

02:22:39.400 --> 02:22:42.941
ORION: No, but it's of her, it's a youie.

02:22:42.941 --> 02:22:45.308
TRAVIS: But it's with your staff.

02:22:45.308 --> 02:22:49.995
LIAM: What is the piece of art immortalized upon?
A piece of wood?

02:22:49.995 --> 02:22:53.602
ORION: Oh. And I open my Scroll of Telescription,
I'm like, see?

02:22:53.602 --> 02:22:59.714
LAURA: Oh look, now I can remember this moment
forever. Thank you. Trinket,

02:22:59.714 --> 02:23:02.290
let's go get you a bath.

02:23:02.290 --> 02:23:04.284
TRAVIS: We got so much money.

02:23:04.284 --> 02:23:08.597
LAURA: I go and put it in the party funds. We got
our gold.

02:23:08.597 --> 02:23:11.879
SAM: Good job. We can pay back Gilmore.

02:23:11.879 --> 02:23:18.077
LIAM: For my share? Just my share.

02:23:18.077 --> 02:23:21.511
LAURA: Are we splitting up all the party gold
now?

02:23:21.511 --> 02:23:29.874
ORION: Vex? I give her the picture. Now you have a
picture of your bear with the silly bows.

02:23:29.874 --> 02:23:32.039
LAURA: Oh, thank you.

02:23:32.039 --> 02:23:37.569
LIAM: And I take advantage of her good mood and
say, I just want 1,200 gold, and I won't ask for

02:23:37.569 --> 02:23:39.501
any more of it, any of the amount.

02:23:39.501 --> 02:23:41.793
ORION: Ooh, yes, I would like the same thing.

02:23:41.793 --> 02:23:47.637
LAURA: Do you want me to just split up all the
party gold right now?

02:23:47.637 --> 02:23:52.810
SAM: No, I don't, no. Just give us a quick
stipend. Give us each 1,500 and let's move on.

02:23:52.810 --> 02:23:59.254
LAURA: Everybody gets 1,500. Is everybody happy?
Trinket, are you just so thrilled?

02:23:59.254 --> 02:24:01.789
MATT: (sad bear noises) He's pulling them out with
his claws as best he can.

02:24:01.789 --> 02:24:04.226
LAURA: Oh, sweetie. Bath time.

02:24:04.226 --> 02:24:15.537
MATT: Trinket stands up and heads out to the front
courtyard. All right, so it's 1,500 times seven.

02:24:15.537 --> 02:24:18.131
LAURA: I'll do the math.

02:24:18.131 --> 02:24:21.042
SAM: Let's go do our recon. Who's doing it?

02:24:21.042 --> 02:24:22.645
TRAVIS: Are we going to kill them?

02:24:22.645 --> 02:24:24.847
SAM: No, we're just going to go spy on them.

02:24:24.847 --> 02:24:29.632
TALIESIN: I'd like to finish my morning crafting
before moving into the evening crafting. I'm going

02:24:29.632 --> 02:24:32.965
to have help. I'm working on project number
three.

02:24:32.965 --> 02:24:39.289
MATT: Okay. This is probably going to take you the
rest of the week. It's an extensive project.

02:24:39.289 --> 02:24:44.213
TALIESIN: If I have a little help? This is
something I've been

02:24:44.213 --> 02:24:45.694
tinkering with for quite a while, now.

02:24:45.694 --> 02:24:48.788
MATT: Right, but it's also the most complicated
thing, outside of the gun,

02:24:48.788 --> 02:24:50.259
that you've constructed.

02:24:50.259 --> 02:24:51.870
TRAVIS: We've got a couple more days, too.

02:24:51.870 --> 02:24:55.960
ORION: How many days have passed, since we've been
doing this? Two?

02:24:55.960 --> 02:25:01.682
LIAM: Percy, you go to work. We'll figure out
everything else.

02:25:01.682 --> 02:25:03.274
MATT: It's up to you.

02:25:03.274 --> 02:25:08.180
TALIESIN: Do you think I'll have time to finish
everything that's on my list, if I roll well?

02:25:08.180 --> 02:25:11.156
MATT: Probably not everything. You'll have to
choose between a couple.

02:25:11.156 --> 02:25:13.536
LIAM: What if he rolls a 20?

02:25:13.536 --> 02:25:22.466
TALIESIN: Because I was going to have Keyleth
lightning spell to help set the battery for the--

02:25:22.466 --> 02:25:24.681
MATT: Right. Well, that is technically an
enchantment.

02:25:24.681 --> 02:25:27.841
TALIESIN: If it just uses it to start a charge?

02:25:27.841 --> 02:25:29.467
MATT: Oh, to start a charge? Then you can do it.

02:25:29.467 --> 02:25:31.224
TALIESIN: Okay. Yeah, I was going to Frankenstein
this.

02:25:31.224 --> 02:25:35.709
MATT: Okay. We can begin the roll now.

02:25:35.709 --> 02:25:37.014
TALIESIN: All right.

02:25:37.014 --> 02:25:39.035
MATT: Go ahead and make a tinkering roll.

02:25:39.035 --> 02:25:41.416
TALIESIN: That's better. 20.

02:25:41.416 --> 02:25:48.057
MATT: 20, okay. Not actually doing the charge yet,
because you're building the basis of the

02:25:48.057 --> 02:25:54.017
structure. You help him downstairs in his workshop
with the various materials to begin crafting the

02:25:54.017 --> 02:26:02.492
actual shell of the the item. What else are you
guys doing?

02:26:02.492 --> 02:26:03.906
SAM: Let's go do recon.

02:26:03.906 --> 02:26:10.373
LIAM: Yeah, what are we checking out, though? I
mean, it's not like the Briarwoods are out in

02:26:10.373 --> 02:26:12.679
public. We don't know anything about them.

02:26:12.679 --> 02:26:14.962
LAURA: We need to ask around town about the
Briarwoods.

02:26:14.962 --> 02:26:19.533
SAM: We need to get into the Briarwoods' estate
and talk to them.

02:26:19.533 --> 02:26:23.406
MARISHA: Well, they're not local. They're coming
into town.

02:26:23.406 --> 02:26:27.610
They're coming into town in five to seven days.

02:26:27.610 --> 02:26:33.731
MATT: No, they're arriving now in six days and
arriving for the actual feast.

02:26:33.731 --> 02:26:35.384
SAM: Where's the feast to be held?

02:26:35.384 --> 02:26:36.939
MATT: It's to be held in the palace.

02:26:36.939 --> 02:26:38.797
LAURA: Shit. We can't do any spying.

02:26:38.797 --> 02:26:40.287
MARISHA: Not on them.

02:26:40.287 --> 02:26:47.416
ORION: All we can do is get gear and do things and
we can sleep for a few days.

02:26:47.416 --> 02:26:50.365
TALIESIN: You can help me in the workshop.

02:26:50.365 --> 02:26:55.166
MARISHA: Make a plan. Maybe make a plan? We don't
really have a plan.

02:26:55.166 --> 02:27:02.047
LIAM: Can you remind me and the group, the dinner,
I know it's with the Briarwoods, but who else? Is

02:27:02.047 --> 02:27:03.686
it with Uriel or who is it with?

02:27:03.686 --> 02:27:07.580
MATT: It's with Uriel, the Council, which is why
you guys were invited, also because Percy asked.

02:27:07.580 --> 02:27:15.629
And the Briarwoods. It is partially to discuss and
celebrate the agreed-upon construction of a bridge

02:27:15.629 --> 02:27:21.369
that goes across the Shearing Channel at the far
northeastern side of the continent of Tal'Dorei.

02:27:21.369 --> 02:27:26.828
There is a large channel where these two large
mountain ranges, which are the closest the two

02:27:26.828 --> 02:27:31.394
continents are to each other, but it's a very
treacherous pass of water, so any trade having to

02:27:31.394 --> 02:27:36.534
be done has had to travel southward, in a big arc
around the bottom of the island, or via

02:27:36.534 --> 02:27:40.981
skyship, both very expensive. This bridge will
enable a much faster trade route between the two

02:27:40.981 --> 02:27:47.062
continents, and Whitestone has essentially been in
charge of spearheading the construction of this

02:27:47.062 --> 02:27:51.723
bridge and making this agreement with Uriel, that
would be overall helpful for both continents. And

02:27:51.723 --> 02:27:55.407
since they've agreed upon this, they've been
invited here to Emon for the first time to have

02:27:55.407 --> 02:27:57.696
dinner with the Council and Uriel to celebrate
it.

02:27:57.696 --> 02:28:00.069
LIAM: We maybe want to talk to Uriel.

02:28:00.069 --> 02:28:05.280
LAURA: Maybe. Maybe you guys should go, because I
want to spend the next few days training Trinket

02:28:05.280 --> 02:28:10.748
how to roly-poly roll forward and bludgeon people
with his armor.

02:28:10.748 --> 02:28:14.660
MATT: (laughs) Okay.

02:28:14.660 --> 02:28:22.431
MARISHA: I mean, the only thing I can think--
Percy. Do you still have an idea of what the

02:28:22.431 --> 02:28:23.924
Briarwoods look like?

02:28:23.924 --> 02:28:25.486
TALIESIN: Oh yes.

02:28:25.486 --> 02:28:28.519
MARISHA: I could attempt another scrying spell.
Could even possibly

02:28:28.519 --> 02:28:31.246
go to Allura for help and try again.

02:28:31.246 --> 02:28:37.522
TALIESIN: See if Allura will come here, because I
want to keep working. And I'll also say we should

02:28:37.522 --> 02:28:41.427
send word to Uriel that I will not be myself at
the--

02:28:41.427 --> 02:28:43.844
SAM: Yes, that might be very strange.

02:28:43.844 --> 02:28:48.041
LAURA: We should maybe send word to him that the
Briarwoods should be watched.

02:28:48.041 --> 02:28:51.776
TALIESIN: The less we say, the better.

02:28:51.776 --> 02:28:54.420
MARISHA: What makes you say that?

02:28:54.420 --> 02:29:04.305
LIAM: You think Uriel might be in the Briarwoods'
pocket and pass on that we're aware.

02:29:04.305 --> 02:29:06.741
TALIESIN: It would not be the first time.

02:29:06.741 --> 02:29:08.130
LIAM: That's true.

02:29:08.130 --> 02:29:13.189
SAM: Yes, even if you wear this disguise hat,
Percy, how are you going to get into this event?

02:29:13.189 --> 02:29:16.377
It's a private event. You can't just be some
random person.

02:29:16.377 --> 02:29:19.571
TALIESIN: I will be with you, and if we can let
Uriel know that

02:29:19.571 --> 02:29:22.048
I am coming under a false pretense.

02:29:22.048 --> 02:29:24.975
SAM: Yeah, but that's going to arouse all kinds of
suspicion.

02:29:24.975 --> 02:29:29.069
MARISHA: Exactly, yeah, if we tell Uriel you're
coming as someone else, he's going to ask why.

02:29:29.069 --> 02:29:31.254
TALIESIN: He knows that I don't trust them.

02:29:31.254 --> 02:29:32.925
TRAVIS: He does?

02:29:32.925 --> 02:29:34.239
TALIESIN: He does.

02:29:34.239 --> 02:29:36.604
MARISHA: Wait, who was it that came and talked to
us? Who was that?

02:29:36.604 --> 02:29:38.985
MATT: That was Seeker Asum.

02:29:38.985 --> 02:29:45.220
MARISHA: I was going to say, it was Seeker Asum,
but he didn't say that Uriel had his doubts, he

02:29:45.220 --> 02:29:46.751
said he had his doubts.

02:29:46.751 --> 02:29:48.432
TALIESIN: So let's let Asum know.

02:29:48.432 --> 02:29:50.489
MARISHA: Let Asum know.

02:29:50.489 --> 02:29:52.978
SAM: Why don't you disguise yourself as--

02:29:52.978 --> 02:29:54.953
TALIESIN: Burt Reynolds.

02:29:54.953 --> 02:29:58.824
SAM: What about Vax? He can sneak in.

02:29:58.824 --> 02:30:02.798
TALIESIN: Will the hat let me choose who I look
like?

02:30:02.798 --> 02:30:06.739
MATT: The hat, like any Minor Illusion spell, you
can choose your appearance.

02:30:06.739 --> 02:30:09.404
TALIESIN: How much of a shape-change can I--

02:30:09.404 --> 02:30:11.884
MATT: I mean, you can look pretty close to
somebody else.

02:30:11.884 --> 02:30:13.865
TALIESIN: Could I look like Grog?

02:30:13.865 --> 02:30:22.228
MATT: You could. But as it is an illusion, there
is no physical-- so if somebody were to reach up

02:30:22.228 --> 02:30:24.149
and touch your shoulder, it would just pass
through.

02:30:24.149 --> 02:30:29.189
MARISHA: Right, and your voice doesn't change, so
you probably don't want to try

02:30:29.189 --> 02:30:31.158
and sound like Grog all night.

02:30:31.158 --> 02:30:33.209
TALIESIN: Well, I was actually thinking of Pike,
but.

02:30:33.209 --> 02:30:37.673
SAM: Ooh, Pike. You could be Pike. You would be a
very big Pike.

02:30:37.673 --> 02:30:45.615
LIAM: Percival, there's nothing I want more than
for you to take Bad News and unload it on every

02:30:45.615 --> 02:30:58.476
one of those motherfucking shits, but if you're me
and I'm nobody, if I'm a ghost, I can help take

02:30:58.476 --> 02:31:00.140
out one or two.

02:31:00.140 --> 02:31:03.506
TALIESIN: You'll stick to the shadows, and I'll be
you.

02:31:03.506 --> 02:31:07.806
MARISHA: Not to be-- sorry, you were going to say
something?

02:31:07.806 --> 02:31:10.297
TALIESIN: No, that's actually a pretty good plan.

02:31:10.297 --> 02:31:11.637
LIAM: How many days left?

02:31:11.637 --> 02:31:12.781
MATT: Six.

02:31:12.781 --> 02:31:22.267
LIAM: Can I ask you a question, DM? I have in the
assassin perks. I think it says seven days, I can

02:31:22.267 --> 02:31:29.749
be anybody. As long as I don't do anything else
and I work on getting the right papers, and no one

02:31:29.749 --> 02:31:40.489
will know who I am, 100%, but it's six days, so am
I shit out of luck? This is why I was talking

02:31:40.489 --> 02:31:42.357
about it yesterday, motherfuckers.

02:31:42.357 --> 02:31:45.150
TALIESIN: That's okay. It's a good plan. I think
this plan is a good plan.

02:31:45.150 --> 02:31:48.993
ORION: I think we'll be fine, because I have
privilege perk.

02:31:48.993 --> 02:31:51.195
LIAM: You make me invisible.

02:31:51.195 --> 02:31:53.953
SAM: I can also do that. Or he can.

02:31:53.953 --> 02:31:55.073
LIAM: Yeah, one of you two.

02:31:55.073 --> 02:32:01.306
SAM: No problem. I know it's a few days off, but
we should have some sort of safe word. Some sort

02:32:01.306 --> 02:32:07.545
of attack word. Grog, any suggestions?

02:32:07.545 --> 02:32:08.708
TRAVIS: Jenga.

02:32:08.708 --> 02:32:10.976
ALL: Jenga.

02:32:10.976 --> 02:32:20.515
MARISHA: I like that. We're not hired to kill the
Briarwoods, and not to be that member of the group

02:32:20.515 --> 02:32:27.142
that has a golden heart and wants to ruin
everyone's fun. I don't want to stand between you

02:32:27.142 --> 02:32:36.796
and your revenge that you are absolutely owed,
Percy, but are you sure this is what you want? Is

02:32:36.796 --> 02:32:38.703
this going to make you feel better?

02:32:38.703 --> 02:32:46.271
TALIESIN: I don't know what I want. I want to see
them. I want to look at them. I want to see them.

02:32:46.271 --> 02:32:49.212
MARISHA: Do you want to talk to them?

02:32:49.212 --> 02:32:52.127
TALIESIN: No. I want to listen to them.

02:32:52.127 --> 02:32:53.913
TRAVIS: Then we follow your lead.

02:32:53.913 --> 02:32:56.198
TALIESIN: I want to see them. I don't know.

02:32:56.198 --> 02:33:01.905
MARISHA: Do you want us to fucking capture them
and drag them back to the cell that we built in

02:33:01.905 --> 02:33:05.726
our keep? We built it for a reason.

02:33:05.726 --> 02:33:11.182
SAM: (whistles) She gambles now. She's crazy.

02:33:11.182 --> 02:33:13.663
MARISHA: I know, I've been opened up to so many
things.

02:33:13.663 --> 02:33:17.279
TALIESIN: The best I can give you is we'll just
have to see what happens.

02:33:17.279 --> 02:33:26.679
LIAM: Percival, I trust you implicitly. You have
earned that trust. Do you believe them to be evil

02:33:26.679 --> 02:33:28.447
in the purest sense?

02:33:28.447 --> 02:33:29.838
TALIESIN: I do.

02:33:29.838 --> 02:33:32.537
LAURA and LIAM: That's all we need.

02:33:32.537 --> 02:33:36.681
SAM: We don't even need that much. If you'd just
said to kill someone, we'd probably do it.

02:33:36.681 --> 02:33:42.680
TALIESIN: I saw things.

02:33:42.680 --> 02:33:49.156
LAURA: Should we prepare? Let's do it! I've been
training Trinket, though, does that help?

02:33:49.156 --> 02:33:51.275
MARISHA: I've been reading my alchemy books.

02:33:51.275 --> 02:33:53.425
MATT: Six beard checks.

02:33:53.425 --> 02:33:55.478
SAM: I went to get business cards.

02:33:55.478 --> 02:33:59.233
MATT: Right. That'll cost you 25 gold for 100.

02:33:59.233 --> 02:34:04.948
SAM: I'm going to get two sets. One says Scanlan
Shorthalt, one says Burt Reynolds.

02:34:04.948 --> 02:34:07.794
MATT: Okay. Both have been constructed without
question.

02:34:07.794 --> 02:34:10.238
LIAM: I repaid my debt to Gilmore.

02:34:10.238 --> 02:34:12.174
MATT: All right, debt is paid, mark off that
gold.

02:34:12.174 --> 02:34:16.946
LAURA: Yes!

02:34:16.946 --> 02:34:18.786
MATT: How many is that?

02:34:18.786 --> 02:34:32.865
TRAVIS: I'm at five total, right? 46. 45. 55. A
one. And a 95.

02:34:32.865 --> 02:34:43.148
MATT: By the end of this week, you have grown what
is a rather majestic full chin-beard. You are

02:34:43.148 --> 02:34:51.716
probably the first goliath to have facial hair.
It's a full, we're talking Portland man.

02:34:51.716 --> 02:34:54.541
SAM: Oh no.

02:34:54.541 --> 02:35:05.580
LIAM: Another thing that I did was go off and get
a lathering cream, and the second to last night,

02:35:05.580 --> 02:35:10.735
after I took Grog out to the tavern, I bought him
a lot of drinks.

02:35:10.735 --> 02:35:12.478
TRAVIS: I assume dodge.

02:35:12.478 --> 02:35:14.048
LIAM: I didn't shave off his whole beard.

02:35:14.048 --> 02:35:16.099
Only half of it.

02:35:16.099 --> 02:35:19.130
TRAVIS: I just became the most handsome man in the
world.

02:35:19.130 --> 02:35:21.435
LAURA: Do not shave his fucking beard off.

02:35:21.435 --> 02:35:23.076
LIAM: This much.

02:35:23.076 --> 02:35:34.006
MATT: Make a stealth check. Make a perception
check. You just broke a mechanical pencil!

02:35:34.006 --> 02:35:39.238
(laughter)

02:35:39.347 --> 02:35:46.412
LIAM: DM? I rolled a natural 20. I have advantage
on stealth checks, and I rolled an 18 and a 20.

02:35:46.412 --> 02:35:47.816
Natural 20.

02:35:47.816 --> 02:35:56.776
MATT: Sleeping soundly, drunk, you do not hear the
approach of Vax. As you pull out your blade and

02:35:56.776 --> 02:35:59.781
get ready, I want you to roll a sleight of hand
check.

02:35:59.781 --> 02:36:01.564
LIAM: After the 20?

02:36:01.564 --> 02:36:05.630
MATT: One thing to not be noticed. It's another to
shave someone's face without being noticed. This

02:36:05.630 --> 02:36:08.455
is about stillness of fingers, not just how
stealthy you can be.

02:36:08.455 --> 02:36:14.853
LIAM: I'm using Luck. Okay, so I rolled a 21.

02:36:14.853 --> 02:36:20.210
MATT: Roll a perception check, Grog. With
advantage because this is against your face.

02:36:20.210 --> 02:36:25.612
TRAVIS: 13.

02:36:25.612 --> 02:36:27.997
LIAM: 21.

02:36:27.997 --> 02:36:29.435
MATT: All right.

02:36:29.435 --> 02:36:31.503
LAURA: Why are you so evil?

02:36:31.503 --> 02:36:34.492
LIAM: Why did he trip me and make me eat shit two
months ago?

02:36:34.492 --> 02:36:37.186
TALIESIN, MARISHA, and ORION: Oh!

02:36:37.186 --> 02:36:40.316
TRAVIS: Appetizer of things to come, my friend.

02:36:40.316 --> 02:36:47.757
MATT: The crowing sound of a distant rooster. The
farmlands that surround the outside of Emon, which

02:36:47.757 --> 02:36:54.326
are relatively close, within earshot. The morning
sun rises, cresting over the eastern skyline of

02:36:54.326 --> 02:37:02.847
Tal'Dorei. Grog, you come to consciousness,
stretch, reach up to rub-- half a beard.

02:37:02.847 --> 02:37:08.402
TRAVIS: Half a beard? Like, just one side of my
face?

02:37:08.402 --> 02:37:09.946
MATT: One side of your face.

02:37:09.946 --> 02:37:12.493
TRAVIS: I say in a low, guttural growl--

02:37:12.493 --> 02:37:14.314
LIAM: You have no idea it was me.

02:37:14.314 --> 02:37:19.996
TRAVIS: Vax. I didn't have to wake up to know it
was you, motherfucker.

02:37:19.996 --> 02:37:22.845
LIAM: Make an intelligence check! Make him make an
intelligence check!

02:37:22.845 --> 02:37:25.423
MARISHA: We all know it was you.

02:37:25.423 --> 02:37:34.548
TRAVIS: I reach down, I find a dark stone on the
ground, and I go over to the bare side of my face

02:37:34.548 --> 02:37:40.556
and I draw a very beautiful mustache to complete
the other half of it.

02:37:40.556 --> 02:37:43.522
LIAM: He is dumb as a post. Why does he know--

02:37:43.522 --> 02:37:47.998
TRAVIS: Because you're the only fucking idiot
stupid enough to do that!

02:37:47.998 --> 02:37:53.091
LIAM: Magic is mysterious! Why couldn't you grow
half a beard due to magic?

02:37:53.091 --> 02:37:59.017
TRAVIS: Maybe I don't know. Let's say I assume.

02:37:59.017 --> 02:38:03.281
(laughter)

02:38:03.281 --> 02:38:06.415
MATT: However, it is a new morning. Roll a beard
check.

02:38:06.415 --> 02:38:08.523
TRAVIS: Eight, four.

02:38:08.523 --> 02:38:10.086
MATT: No movement.

02:38:10.086 --> 02:38:12.206
LIAM: Sorry, big guy.

02:38:12.206 --> 02:38:21.820
MATT: All right, so as a note, Percy, I want you
to make four more tinkering rolls.

02:38:21.820 --> 02:38:23.472
TALIESIN: All right.

02:38:23.472 --> 02:38:27.557
SAM: I'm going to give him inspiration for one of
them.

02:38:27.557 --> 02:38:32.564
(singing) Do you want to build a machine gun?

02:38:32.564 --> 02:38:36.033
TALIESIN: (singing) Why, yes, I really do.

02:38:36.033 --> 02:38:37.544
MATT: What have you got?

02:38:37.544 --> 02:38:39.433
TALIESIN: 28.

02:38:39.433 --> 02:38:42.717
MATT: 28, okay. Second one?

02:38:42.717 --> 02:38:46.181
MARISHA: Oh god.

02:38:46.181 --> 02:38:49.228
MATT: Dice going everywhere.

02:38:49.351 --> 02:38:53.654
SAM: Inspiration, d10.

02:38:53.654 --> 02:38:56.997
TALIESIN: I got a d6 from the last one you did.

02:38:56.997 --> 02:38:59.472
MATT: d6 is what I gave you.

02:38:59.472 --> 02:39:05.704
TALIESIN: d10, so I'll roll a d10 with the next
one. That one was 20.

02:39:05.704 --> 02:39:07.632
MATT: All right. Third one?

02:39:07.632 --> 02:39:11.932
TALIESIN: 28.

02:39:11.932 --> 02:39:18.033
MATT: All right, and the fourth one?

02:39:18.033 --> 02:39:19.342
TALIESIN: 23.

02:39:19.342 --> 02:39:24.917
MATT: Okay, so over the next few days, you've
constructed what amounts to a large, metallic

02:39:24.917 --> 02:39:33.025
gauntlet. You have taken this gauntlet and wired
all through it insulation and metallic insulating

02:39:33.025 --> 02:39:39.563
tips in what is essentially a small, for lack of a
better term, alternator of some kind.

02:39:39.563 --> 02:39:43.450
TALIESIN: I was going to try to sneak in a few
bullets during that time.

02:39:43.450 --> 02:39:48.876
MATT: The fifth roll's going to be that. You have
constructed this device. The quality seems fair.

02:39:48.876 --> 02:39:54.909
It's untested technology, just something that's a
brainchild of your own, utilizing Keyleth's aid.

02:39:54.909 --> 02:40:00.007
Keyleth, I'm going to have you roll a wisdom
check. Roll that and add five.

02:40:00.007 --> 02:40:05.045
MARISHA: Well. Add just my base wisdom?

02:40:05.045 --> 02:40:07.353
MATT: Plus six, it would be. Sorry.

02:40:07.353 --> 02:40:09.035
MARISHA: Yes, plus six, so 20 total.

02:40:09.035 --> 02:40:12.509
MATT: 20 total. You step out and you set it down
in the middle of the courtyard. Keyleth, you

02:40:12.509 --> 02:40:17.304
summon a storm that slowly gathers above the top
of the keep. You guys start hearing sounds like

02:40:17.304 --> 02:40:20.248
rolling thunder outside and you come and look, and
you see Percy and Keyleth are out standing in the

02:40:20.248 --> 02:40:24.852
middle of the courtyard. Keyleth with her arm in
the air as this black, dark storm cloud begins to

02:40:24.852 --> 02:40:30.823
swirl above the entirety of Greyskull Keep. With
that, she brings her hand up and then brings her

02:40:30.823 --> 02:40:35.075
fist down as a bolt of energy (thunder clap)
streaks down from the clouds, slamming into a

02:40:35.075 --> 02:40:39.292
small object on the ground that then gets flung
about 15 feet in a random direction. Tumbles to

02:40:39.292 --> 02:40:43.106
the ground. You rush over to grab it. You can see
arcing over the metal. (electric sparking) These

02:40:43.106 --> 02:40:48.426
small electric arcs. You reach over and wait a
second. You prod it. Pick it up and it's hot. Drop

02:40:48.426 --> 02:40:52.884
it instinctively. You give it a few minutes to
cool off. Pick it up when it's warm enough; you

02:40:52.884 --> 02:40:59.740
put it on and there is essentially this large,
sparking, metal centerpiece that is giving off

02:40:59.740 --> 02:41:01.218
this low hum.

02:41:01.218 --> 02:41:05.121
MARISHA: Did it work? Try it on Tiberius.

02:41:05.121 --> 02:41:08.731
ORION: Sure. Here.

02:41:08.731 --> 02:41:10.497
TALIESIN: Touch.

02:41:10.497 --> 02:41:15.111
MATT: Okay. Tiberius, make a constitution saving
throw.

02:41:15.111 --> 02:41:19.637
SAM and ORION: No!

02:41:19.637 --> 02:41:22.458
(laughter)

02:41:22.458 --> 02:41:32.544
MATT: All right, you suffer 14 points of lightning
damage and are stunned for a round. I need you to

02:41:32.544 --> 02:41:40.580
go ahead and roll a d20.

02:41:40.580 --> 02:41:44.816
TALIESIN: Cock-a-dooed. (yelps)

02:41:44.816 --> 02:41:48.220
MARISHA: High rolls startle him.

02:41:48.220 --> 02:41:49.549
TALIESIN: 19.

02:41:49.549 --> 02:41:56.131
MATT: 19, okay. It stays intact from the force of
it. A little bit of the energy that was stored in

02:41:56.131 --> 02:42:00.837
there appears to dissipate. You figure there's
only a few applications of this before it needs to

02:42:00.837 --> 02:42:08.911
be recharged, and every single time it's utilized,
there's a low chance that it may detonate, or

02:42:08.911 --> 02:42:11.324
crumble, or something bad may happen.

02:42:11.324 --> 02:42:14.792
SAM: Percy, that's amazing! What do you call it?

02:42:14.792 --> 02:42:17.857
ORION: (unintelligible mumbling)

02:42:17.857 --> 02:42:23.119
TALIESIN: Are you all right, Tiberius?

02:42:23.119 --> 02:42:27.754
MARISHA: I go over and give him a Cure Wounds.

02:42:27.754 --> 02:42:32.652
MATT: You manage to eventually shake off all your
muscles that were so locked, tense,

02:42:32.652 --> 02:42:34.199
give way for a second.

02:42:34.199 --> 02:42:35.473
ORION: It's effective.

02:42:35.473 --> 02:42:37.840
MARISHA: That was awesome.

02:42:37.840 --> 02:42:39.252
TALIESIN: I call it Diplomacy.

02:42:39.252 --> 02:42:40.920
SAM: Diplomacy?

02:42:40.920 --> 02:42:42.495
LAURA: I like it.

02:42:42.495 --> 02:42:44.751
TRAVIS: That's great.

02:42:44.751 --> 02:42:52.178
LAURA: As we're standing watching that, Trinket
comes &lt;i&gt;rolling&lt;/i&gt; into the courtyard!

02:42:52.178 --> 02:42:54.497
MATT: Let's go ahead and make an animal handling
check.

02:42:54.497 --> 02:42:59.915
LAURA: Oh, why didn't I get more points in that?

02:42:59.915 --> 02:43:02.640
LIAM: Roll high. Come on.

02:43:02.640 --> 02:43:08.737
MATT: I say with advantage because Trinket's been
your companion for so long.

02:43:08.737 --> 02:43:10.972
LAURA: Natural 20!

02:43:10.972 --> 02:43:17.028
MATT: Which is close to what you needed because
this is a very difficult feat. Over the week

02:43:17.028 --> 02:43:21.959
you've worked with Trinket and you've worked on a
technique where, instead of a multi-attack,

02:43:21.959 --> 02:43:26.796
Trinket can do what is essentially a trample
attack, meaning Trinket can roll forward and roll

02:43:26.796 --> 02:43:30.713
through anything that's equal to or smaller. And
damage everything in that path.

02:43:30.713 --> 02:43:35.146
LIAM: (singing) Circus bear.

02:43:35.146 --> 02:43:40.521
MATT: We'll go over the logistics of that some
other time, but Trinket has now learned a

02:43:40.521 --> 02:43:42.180
roly-poly trample attack.

02:43:42.180 --> 02:43:44.383
LAURA: Should we call it the roly-poly or the
cannonball?

02:43:44.383 --> 02:43:45.585
TRAVIS: That's your call.

02:43:45.585 --> 02:43:48.335
MATT: It's your call. Call it what you want.

02:43:48.335 --> 02:43:50.479
LIAM: Roly-poly is cute; cannonball is--

02:43:50.479 --> 02:43:52.840
LAURA: I think I like cannonball because it's
better to shout during the battle.

02:43:52.840 --> 02:43:54.429
MATT: The Trinket cannonball.

02:43:54.429 --> 02:43:56.687
LIAM: Roly-poly!

02:43:56.687 --> 02:44:03.996
ORION: For brevity, I rolled six dice. I rolled,
the only high ones worth mentioning was a 13, a

02:44:03.996 --> 02:44:05.465
15, and 18.

02:44:05.465 --> 02:44:07.144
MATT: With a 15 and an 18--

02:44:07.144 --> 02:44:08.241
ORION: 17, I mean.

02:44:08.241 --> 02:44:09.165
MATT: Yeah.

02:44:09.165 --> 02:44:15.229
ORION: And the, because they're all negative
three. And I attempted to teach to Lockheed to

02:44:15.229 --> 02:44:20.534
hide and speak and to stay.

02:44:20.534 --> 02:44:25.017
MATT: Okay. To hide and to speak. To stay did not
stick, unfortunately. You had two rolls that were

02:44:25.017 --> 02:44:32.255
high enough to get those two in there though. Hide
and speak. All right. The morning has come to

02:44:32.255 --> 02:44:37.925
fruition. You have a few hours before you're
supposed to arrive at the palace. You have been

02:44:37.925 --> 02:44:41.239
notified that this is a very formal event.

02:44:41.239 --> 02:44:43.916
SAM: We'll need fancy robes.

02:44:43.916 --> 02:44:47.643
LAURA: Oh, we have some formal dresses already.

02:44:47.643 --> 02:44:50.199
MATT: Roll again, please.

02:44:50.199 --> 02:44:52.483
TALIESIN: 23.

02:44:52.483 --> 02:45:00.889
MATT: You manage to construct 20 pieces of
ammunition from 20 units of materials.

02:45:00.889 --> 02:45:03.348
TRAVIS: We have three fancy robes.

02:45:03.348 --> 02:45:07.439
ORION: Oh, and I've picked up my glaive, right?
Two days. It was time to.

02:45:07.439 --> 02:45:12.659
MATT: You go back to Karin. You now have 
some kind of a knife-glaive thing.

02:45:12.659 --> 02:45:17.347
ORION: Krull! I'm naming it Krull.

02:45:17.347 --> 02:45:23.225
MATT: You are unsure how it will work in combat?
But it looks neat.

02:45:23.225 --> 02:45:24.814
ORION: And I attach it to my coat.

02:45:24.814 --> 02:45:27.441
MATT: It just hangs to the side. Careful how you
sit.

02:45:27.441 --> 02:45:31.515
LIAM: Do I still have the finery I wore to the
Velvet Cabaret?

02:45:31.515 --> 02:45:33.944
MATT: You would, yes.

02:45:33.944 --> 02:45:36.603
LIAM: All right. So we have to worry about you,
Grog.

02:45:36.603 --> 02:45:40.151
TRAVIS: Are there any tapestries or curtains in
the castle?

02:45:40.151 --> 02:45:41.400
MATT: There are, actually.

02:45:41.400 --> 02:45:46.183
TRAVIS: I walk up to the prettiest one and I rip
it down, and I throw it over myself like a toga.

02:45:46.183 --> 02:45:50.014
MARISHA: (laughing) It's pretty good.

02:45:50.014 --> 02:45:55.850
MATT: It, in a "Foreigner in a Foreign Land" kind
of way, could work.

02:45:55.850 --> 02:46:02.399
TRAVIS: And I practice my curtsy. Because I've
seen Vex and Keyleth do it,

02:46:02.399 --> 02:46:04.712
so I think everybody does it.

02:46:04.712 --> 02:46:08.738
ORION: I do it, as well. I don't know what's going
on.

02:46:08.738 --> 02:46:11.299
TALIESIN: I want to see him roll an athletics
check for that.

02:46:11.299 --> 02:46:12.659
LAURA: Tiberius.

02:46:12.659 --> 02:46:13.535
ORION: Yes?

02:46:13.535 --> 02:46:20.697
LAURA: Could you Prestidigitate this thing and
make it look like an actual thing?

02:46:20.697 --> 02:46:22.256
SAM: Not for very long.

02:46:22.256 --> 02:46:23.674
MATT: That's more of an illusion.

02:46:23.674 --> 02:46:25.097
LIAM: You pull the hairs out.

02:46:25.097 --> 02:46:28.506
TRAVIS: What's wrong with this? I'm from a strange
land. My customs are my own.

02:46:28.506 --> 02:46:31.679
SAM: Grog, have you washed yourself in water at
all this week?

02:46:31.679 --> 02:46:33.024
TRAVIS: No. It burns.

02:46:33.024 --> 02:46:38.279
ORION I do Prestidigitation immediately to get rid
of some kind of smell that I'm sure is emanating.

02:46:38.279 --> 02:46:41.507
TRAVIS: I freak out running around the room.
(screams)

02:46:41.507 --> 02:46:46.302
ORION: It's not water, Grog. And I keep casting it
on him. It's fine, see. (splash)

02:46:46.302 --> 02:46:47.759
LAURA: You're fine.

02:46:47.759 --> 02:46:52.605
TRAVIS: It must have been that powder you gave me
before. It made me immune.

02:46:52.605 --> 02:47:00.124
LAURA: That's what it was. You're immune. You're
definitely immune to water now. Good job.

02:47:00.124 --> 02:47:06.023
ORION: What's wrong with what you're wearing now?

02:47:06.023 --> 02:47:11.844
LAURA: His toga? He's wearing a toga made out of a
tapestry.

02:47:11.844 --> 02:47:18.428
ORION: Oh, so I'll go and I'll use some of my Dust
of Illusion and I'll (pfft) on what he's wearing

02:47:18.428 --> 02:47:21.374
and shape it into a fancier robe.

02:47:21.374 --> 02:47:28.951
MATT: From a visual standpoint, the robe tapers
and curls around his form, and comes to look like

02:47:28.951 --> 02:47:38.530
a nicer robe. The material looks like it's made of
almost a reddish silk. The actual imagery of the

02:47:38.530 --> 02:47:43.432
tapestry slowly fades and becomes just various
textures and material. From your eyes, it's less

02:47:43.432 --> 02:47:46.824
interesting, but from a presentory standpoint it
could be passable.

02:47:46.824 --> 02:47:52.091
LIAM: Don't forget his exotic facial hair, as
well. That probably lends to the whole package.

02:47:52.091 --> 02:47:55.127
MATT: Yeah, which by the way, you guys do see.
It's half giant beard

02:47:55.127 --> 02:47:57.026
and half scrawled-on charcoal.

02:47:57.026 --> 02:48:03.644
ORION: And I notice this, I go: Oh. Oh, Grog. And
I use a little bit more of Dust of Illusion. I

02:48:03.644 --> 02:48:05.607
wipe it. Smear it on there.

02:48:05.607 --> 02:48:06.686
TRAVIS: I wipe it away!

02:48:06.686 --> 02:48:10.336
ORION: No. Stop! Hey, hey, hey-- I put it on.
Actually, I'm going to take it, and I'm going to

02:48:10.336 --> 02:48:14.017
actually put it in your hand and be like-- put it
on your thumb and be like: I want you to smear

02:48:14.017 --> 02:48:21.230
this where the beard was, and I want you to think
really hard that you want it there. Okay? So put

02:48:21.230 --> 02:48:27.597
it on first. There you go. That's it. And now
think really hard that you want it there.

02:48:27.597 --> 02:48:34.907
MATT: The dust tends to glisten, and where there
was once charcoal outline, a mirror to your once

02:48:34.907 --> 02:48:38.154
beautiful beard continues, full, as if nothing had
happened.

02:48:38.154 --> 02:48:42.465
TRAVIS: I reach into the bag of holding and I take
out a little goblet, and I pour some ale in it.

02:48:42.483 --> 02:48:46.157
And I walk over to Vax, and I go, here you go.

02:48:46.157 --> 02:48:54.779
LIAM: This looks very good. Thank you, Grog.

02:48:54.779 --> 02:48:57.095
TRAVIS: You're welcome. Would you like some more?

02:48:57.095 --> 02:49:02.174
LIAM: No, I don't want to cloud my thinking before
we go up against the Briarwoods.

02:49:02.174 --> 02:49:07.807
TRAVIS: Probably smart. I'll take that back. I
crush the goblet in my hand.

02:49:07.807 --> 02:49:10.465
MATT: This creaking metal sound. The goblet is now
destroyed.

02:49:10.465 --> 02:49:15.059
TRAVIS: Oh no! What happened?

02:49:15.059 --> 02:49:22.765
MATT: All right, dressed up, you all make your way
to the Cloudtop district as the sun begins to

02:49:22.765 --> 02:49:28.143
bring itself to the other side of the horizon. As
you approach the outside of the Tal'Dorei palace,

02:49:28.143 --> 02:49:34.295
there are general guards set up to accept guests.
They're just there in wait as part of their

02:49:34.295 --> 02:49:39.562
process today. As soon as you arrive and announce
yourselves as having arrived, is there anything

02:49:39.562 --> 02:49:41.047
you want to do to prepare?

02:49:41.047 --> 02:49:43.035
SAM: Well, are you in disguise yet, Percy?

02:49:43.035 --> 02:49:45.808
TALIESIN: Yes, I look like Vax.

02:49:45.808 --> 02:49:46.971
SAM: Cloaked Vax?

02:49:46.971 --> 02:49:48.594
LIAM: Where are we?

02:49:48.594 --> 02:49:51.589
MATT: You guys are nearing the palace right now.

02:49:51.589 --> 02:49:54.004
LIAM: Nearing the palace? Hit me.

02:49:54.004 --> 02:49:59.106
MARISHA: I produce a few flower cummerbunds and
start pinning them on the party.

02:49:59.106 --> 02:50:04.955
LAURA: I go in and put my arm through Percy's arm
to make it seem like we're twins. I go in with

02:50:04.955 --> 02:50:08.232
Percy to make it look like we're the twinsies.

02:50:08.232 --> 02:50:13.933
SAM: I'm going to cast Invisibility on Vax.

02:50:13.933 --> 02:50:21.879
TRAVIS: I hand the Potion of Climbing to Vax and
say, don't die.

02:50:21.879 --> 02:50:23.636
LIAM: No promises.

02:50:23.636 --> 02:50:28.189
SAM: You've got one hour until my Invisibility is
going to wear off, so find a shadow.

02:50:28.189 --> 02:50:34.426
MATT: Do you guys make yourselves known at the
palace front?

02:50:34.426 --> 02:50:36.180
SAM: Yes! We're friends here. Yes.

02:50:36.180 --> 02:50:41.234
MATT: As you approach, you make yourselves known.
The guards lead you to the front area of the

02:50:41.234 --> 02:50:49.943
palace. The sun's just starting to hit the distant
side of the water of the Ozmit Sea to the west of

02:50:49.943 --> 02:50:57.618
Emon. As you guys finish talking to the front
guard that you've arrived, Seeker Asum steps out

02:50:57.618 --> 02:51:03.432
of the front of the palace and sees you. "Very
good. Glad you could make it. Please enter. I will

02:51:03.432 --> 02:51:06.182
"wish to speak with you briefly before the event
this evening."

02:51:06.182 --> 02:51:07.608
LAURA: Of course.

02:51:07.608 --> 02:51:09.178
MATT: "Are you missing anyone?"

02:51:09.178 --> 02:51:14.397
LAURA: Oh, yes. Percy wasn't feeling very well. He
ended up staying home.

02:51:14.397 --> 02:51:18.190
MATT: Make a deception check.

02:51:18.190 --> 02:51:25.870
LAURA: 11.

02:51:25.870 --> 02:51:34.440
MATT: "Very well. That's unfortunate. His skills
could have been of use to me. Come inside."

02:51:34.440 --> 02:51:40.922
LAURA: I pat Vax's hand-- Percy's hand. What the
fuck. This is creepy.

02:51:40.922 --> 02:51:42.765
TRAVIS: Call him Vaxy.

02:51:42.765 --> 02:51:44.173
LAURA: Vaxy.

02:51:44.173 --> 02:51:48.189
TALIESIN: That will work just fine. Thank you.

02:51:48.189 --> 02:51:52.691
MATT: He leads you into the green meeting room you
guys have had previous council meetings with. It's

02:51:52.691 --> 02:51:57.637
currently empty. He sets the guards to the side
and brings you inside and says, "All right, so if

02:51:57.637 --> 02:52:03.327
"my little birds speak truth, they should be
arriving around dusk, so we probably have no more

02:52:03.327 --> 02:52:10.790
"than 20 minutes before they are here themselves.
If you're not aware, they should be referred to as

02:52:10.790 --> 02:52:16.859
"Lord and Lady Briarwood. Their names: Lord Sylas
Briarwood and Lady Delilah Briarwood."

02:52:16.859 --> 02:52:18.701
MARISHA: Sylas and Delilah?

02:52:18.701 --> 02:52:23.884
(singing) Hey there, Delilah.

02:52:23.884 --> 02:52:31.368
MATT: "This is a political dinner. Please do your
best not to cause a scene during the meal, as I

02:52:31.368 --> 02:52:34.281
"need that time as a distraction to do my own
digging."

02:52:34.281 --> 02:52:35.479
LAURA: Yes.

02:52:35.479 --> 02:52:36.693
MATT: "Vax."

02:52:36.693 --> 02:52:37.946
TALIESIN: Yes?

02:52:37.946 --> 02:52:42.293
MATT: "You're light of step and quick to fade.
Would you wish to join me on this or

02:52:42.293 --> 02:52:43.921
"stay with the dinner party?"

02:52:43.921 --> 02:52:46.427
TALIESIN: I'll stay with the dinner party. I wish
to observe.

02:52:46.427 --> 02:52:48.359
SAM: He also has a bit of a cold.

02:52:48.359 --> 02:52:51.476
TALIESIN: I wish to observe the Briarwoods
myself.

02:52:51.476 --> 02:52:53.869
MATT: Make a deception check.

02:52:53.869 --> 02:52:57.983
TALIESIN: (gritty voice) I wish to observe.

02:52:57.983 --> 02:53:01.373
LIAM: You've got to go more nasal, Taliesin.

02:53:01.373 --> 02:53:03.105
TALIESIN: Yes, nasal.

02:53:03.105 --> 02:53:05.190
ORION: Yes, you need to go down here.

02:53:05.190 --> 02:53:07.201
SAM: Sort of like sandpaper on a chalkboard.

02:53:07.201 --> 02:53:12.380
MARISHA: I should have done something about this.

02:53:12.380 --> 02:53:13.769
TALIESIN: Five.

02:53:13.769 --> 02:53:27.592
MATT: Asum goes, "All right. If we are to do this,
I would appreciate a little bit of honesty at the

02:53:27.592 --> 02:53:28.854
"front point."

02:53:28.854 --> 02:53:31.312
ORION: Well, I'm Tiberius Stormwind from
Draconia.

02:53:31.312 --> 02:53:32.660
TALIESIN: It's all right.

02:53:32.660 --> 02:53:36.513
SAM: This is not Vax.

02:53:36.513 --> 02:53:39.930
TALIESIN: Asum, it's me.

02:53:39.930 --> 02:53:45.669
MATT: "I gathered as much, as soon as you began to
speak. Now, I can understand, based on our

02:53:45.669 --> 02:53:50.227
"previous conversation, that you have interest in
keeping low key, but know that I am an ally in

02:53:50.227 --> 02:53:54.488
"this. If you're not here, where is the rest of
your party. Where is Vax?"

02:53:54.488 --> 02:53:56.214
TALIESIN: Vax is here.

02:53:56.214 --> 02:53:58.674
LAURA: He's stealthing.

02:53:58.674 --> 02:54:00.124
TALIESIN: He's being quiet.

02:54:00.124 --> 02:54:09.143
MATT: "Well, Vax, if you can hear me, follow me
when the meal begins. I may have use for you. All

02:54:09.143 --> 02:54:13.982
"right, so. The Briarwoods have a very good
relationship with Uriel and the Tal'Dorei council,

02:54:13.982 --> 02:54:21.614
"established back before they expanded outside of
Wildemount. I've sent two of my best gatherers into

02:54:21.614 --> 02:54:27.162
"Wynandir to seek out more information on them. I
don't know when that information will be

02:54:27.162 --> 02:54:32.633
"available; they've only been gone but three days,
and hopefully in time, we'll learn more of what

02:54:32.633 --> 02:54:38.245
"their machinations may be. Many of the noble
houses of Whitestone were left vacant when the de

02:54:38.245 --> 02:54:43.000
"Rolos passed and were given to friends of the
Briarwoods. Whispers that reach me speak of these

02:54:43.000 --> 02:54:49.381
"new nobles, not being highborn, nor affiliated
with the gentry at all, so I'm curious as to what

02:54:49.381 --> 02:54:53.878
"allies they've made either before or after taking
Whitestone for themselves."

02:54:53.878 --> 02:54:58.270
MARISHA: What are the names of these people who've
taken over White--

02:54:58.270 --> 02:55:00.069
LAURA: It was the Briarwoods.

02:55:00.069 --> 02:55:01.703
MATT: "I don't. The Briarwoods have."

02:55:01.703 --> 02:55:03.628
MARISHA: I thought they said they had friends.

02:55:03.628 --> 02:55:07.109
MATT: "I do not know yet. I've sent folks out
there. Those who have been sent to Whitestone have

02:55:07.109 --> 02:55:13.325
"either defected or quit and sent me letters of
resignation which is part of the reason I am very

02:55:13.325 --> 02:55:20.708
"curious as to what's going on in Whitestone. Now,
I've also found the documentation that delivered

02:55:20.708 --> 02:55:24.823
"the ungoverned lands of Whitestone to the
Briarwoods was signed, officiated and cataloged

02:55:24.823 --> 02:55:31.697
"months in advance to the de Rolo family passing.
I'm still following the trail but I find the

02:55:31.697 --> 02:55:42.517
"timing far too convenient. With their arrival
coming up, please be controlled, remember what

02:55:42.517 --> 02:55:45.894
"I've told you and as more information comes in in
the passing weeks I'll bring that to your

02:55:45.894 --> 02:55:53.010
"attention, as well. Be observant, listen, pry what
information you can, but do not raise suspicion."

02:55:53.010 --> 02:56:02.047
SAM: We will be as quiet as a house mouse.
However, if you need us to act, just utter the

02:56:02.047 --> 02:56:03.363
word "jenga."

02:56:03.363 --> 02:56:04.973
MATT: "Jenga."

02:56:04.973 --> 02:56:12.613
MARISHA: I also make a matching corsage and pin it
on his lapel, as well.

02:56:12.613 --> 02:56:16.407
MATT: As you do, he looks down at it and goes,
"Thank you; it's not my color."

02:56:16.407 --> 02:56:20.847
MARISHA: You know, that's fine.

02:56:20.847 --> 02:56:28.689
MATT: "I appreciate the offer but my theme goes
with browns and blacks so as not to be seen. This

02:56:28.689 --> 02:56:30.026
"is a bit bright for my taste."

02:56:30.026 --> 02:56:32.288
MARISHA: It might have had a more utilitarian
purpose, but it's fine.

02:56:32.288 --> 02:56:35.264
MATT: "I'm not going to be at the dinner, but
thank you."

02:56:35.264 --> 02:56:44.997
LAURA: Do you have any of your people learning
about the Briarwoods? Are they magic users in any

02:56:44.997 --> 02:56:47.880
way? Have you heard anything?

02:56:47.880 --> 02:56:52.860
MATT: "The only thing I can recall as the
information of the Briarwoods, at least what's

02:56:52.860 --> 02:57:00.434
"come this way was while they were ruling the lands
in Wildemount as part of their kingdom there, Lady

02:57:00.434 --> 02:57:08.254
"Delilah Briarwood was an accomplished practitioner
of the arcane arts, a long-trained wizard as far

02:57:08.254 --> 02:57:11.805
"as I know and been through quite a few different
schools and had a brief stint here in Emon

02:57:11.805 --> 02:57:18.584
"training at the Lyceum, but that was naught but nine,
ten years back? Maybe more."

02:57:18.584 --> 02:57:24.080
LAURA: Do any of you know, as somebody practiced
in the arcane arts, are you good at seeing through

02:57:24.080 --> 02:57:25.921
illusions? Or--

02:57:25.921 --> 02:57:28.030
SAM: Who, me? Who, us?

02:57:28.030 --> 02:57:31.088
LAURA: Anybody that is, you know, very skilled?

02:57:31.178 --> 02:57:33.786
ORION: (chuckles) Of course. I just need to know
that one's happening.

02:57:33.786 --> 02:57:38.032
So it's tricky, is what I'm saying.

02:57:38.032 --> 02:57:41.820
LAURA: So she wouldn't automatically know. They
wouldn't be able to spot

02:57:41.820 --> 02:57:44.174
immediately that Percy is not actually--

02:57:44.174 --> 02:57:51.059
ORION: Somebody would have to have rather powerful
abilities to see through an illusion spell like

02:57:51.059 --> 02:58:00.000
a disguise or such. It's like a rakshasa
could see though that kind of thing, per

02:58:00.000 --> 02:58:06.336
experience. I doubt that the Briarwoods have
any--

02:58:06.336 --> 02:58:12.719
MATT: At which point you hear, muffled in the
distance a (horn noise) this horn sound that seems

02:58:12.719 --> 02:58:20.892
to be blown as a notification that the arrival of
guests has rolled in.

02:58:20.892 --> 02:58:22.889
TRAVIS: Are you ready for this, Vaxy?

02:58:22.889 --> 02:58:25.384
TALIESIN: No. Let's do this.

02:58:25.384 --> 02:58:27.623
ORION: Would you like me to cast Fireball?

02:58:27.623 --> 02:58:36.697
MATT: Asum goes, "No, please, none of that. Vax,
if you can hear me in this room, ten minutes into

02:58:36.697 --> 02:58:43.843
"the meal see if you can spot me and follow me in
the foyer. Good luck."

02:58:43.843 --> 02:58:46.177
LAURA: Great.

02:58:46.177 --> 02:58:50.694
SAM: Keyleth, I hope you phoned ahead and gave
them your order for a vegan meal.

02:58:50.694 --> 02:58:52.328
MARISHA: Oh, I always do.

02:58:52.328 --> 02:58:57.502
TALIESIN: She's vegan. Of course she told them.

02:58:57.502 --> 02:58:59.450
MARISHA: Exactly. It's on the RSVP.

02:58:59.450 --> 02:59:04.799
MATT: Asum leaves the room. Do you wish to stay
inside,

02:59:04.799 --> 02:59:06.964
do you wish to see the guests as they arrive?

02:59:06.964 --> 02:59:09.058
TALIESIN: Let's go be social.

02:59:09.058 --> 02:59:10.516
SAM: Let's go mingle.

02:59:10.516 --> 02:59:15.264
MATT: All right. You guys head back out to the
front of the palace, the large stairway that leads

02:59:15.264 --> 02:59:19.844
down into the central road outside of the palace
in the middle of the Cloudtop district. The sky

02:59:19.844 --> 02:59:24.612
itself has now come to a dark purple blue slowly
moving over into the distant sunset. The sun has

02:59:24.612 --> 02:59:32.877
disappeared beneath the sea and you've completed
the dusk as the sunset slowly turns gold. A dark

02:59:32.877 --> 02:59:36.973
wood carriage flanked by four armored men on
horseback pulls onto the road right before the

02:59:36.973 --> 02:59:42.248
Tal'Dorei palace. A young man steps from the front
of the carriage and opens the door. Stepping out

02:59:42.248 --> 02:59:50.101
you see a strong, tall man in the nearby lantern
light. Short brown hair frames a very chiseled and

02:59:50.101 --> 02:59:55.849
handsome face adorned with a well groomed goatee.
His clothing is based in blue and black, fitted

02:59:55.849 --> 03:00:01.005
elegance trimmed with golds and red. A strip of
grey fur cresting over one shoulder framing his

03:00:01.005 --> 03:00:09.552
torso. He turns, extends his hand towards the
door, where a feminine gloved hand finds it. A

03:00:09.552 --> 03:00:14.144
beautiful woman steps out after. Her hair dark
auburn and pulled up into a tight braided bun,

03:00:14.144 --> 03:00:19.610
resembling some sort of a glamorous school teacher
almost. Her gown is in the same color scheme as

03:00:19.610 --> 03:00:25.597
the man, if a bit heavier blue than black, and a
long billowing skirt tapers up to be form-fitted

03:00:25.597 --> 03:00:32.094
across her body, continuing upward to wrap her neck
nearly to the jaw. They both turn to face the

03:00:32.094 --> 03:00:37.330
greeting party, bowing slightly as two of their
companion guards flank their approach up the

03:00:37.330 --> 03:00:42.770
steps. The other two helping the young man who
steered the carriage carry their rather large bags

03:00:42.770 --> 03:00:58.707
behind them. This is Lord Sylas Briarwood and Lady
Delilah Briarwood. As you guys are standing here

03:00:58.707 --> 03:01:03.939
at this point, stepping behind you a hand reaches
over and touches the back of your shoulder. You

03:01:03.939 --> 03:01:11.211
look behind you and there, smiling, is Arcanist
Allura Vysoren dressed in a very fine blue gown.

03:01:11.211 --> 03:01:16.073
You've never seen her quite so formal, but very
beautiful type thing. She glances over the

03:01:16.073 --> 03:01:19.722
shoulders, "It's so good to see you. I'm so glad
you all could make it."

03:01:19.722 --> 03:01:22.151
LAURA: So wonderful to see you. I give her a hug.

03:01:22.151 --> 03:01:34.344
MATT: She gives a little hug, too. Glances over at
you. "A pleasure, Vax'ildan."

03:01:34.344 --> 03:01:36.452
ORION: See? She can see it.

03:01:36.452 --> 03:01:38.500
MARISHA: Yes, she can.

03:01:38.500 --> 03:01:47.356
MATT: What are you doing?

03:01:47.356 --> 03:01:52.140
ORION: You look gorgeous Allura, and my friends
are just making weird faces right now. It's

03:01:52.140 --> 03:01:55.120
probably because of how beautiful you look.

03:01:55.120 --> 03:02:00.885
MATT: As you guys are having this discussion about
15 feet from you the Briarwoods enter the palace,

03:02:00.885 --> 03:02:09.987
their guards enter with them. There's been no
pleasantry and very much an intended arrival. None

03:02:09.987 --> 03:02:13.008
of you are recognizable to them, thus they make no
intent of introducing themselves.

03:02:13.008 --> 03:02:14.911
LAURA: We catch any of their eye at all?

03:02:14.911 --> 03:02:19.541
MATT: They appear to be looking about and taking
in their surroundings but they're both engaged in

03:02:19.541 --> 03:02:22.019
a mumbled conversation between the two of them as
they enter.

03:02:22.019 --> 03:02:23.569
MARISHA: Is anyone waiting to greet them?

03:02:23.569 --> 03:02:32.724
MATT: As you follow where they're going, as you
walk into the main foyer area where you stand

03:02:32.724 --> 03:02:38.357
there, waiting carefully at the back, there are a
number of servants that have arrived and have

03:02:38.357 --> 03:02:43.758
taken some of their bags and help them up the
stairs. There is one, the head servant who is

03:02:43.758 --> 03:02:49.023
there talking to them and you hear him speaking to
them. "Wait in your quarters be ready, the meal

03:02:49.023 --> 03:02:52.500
"should be ready within the hour. If you would be
so kind as to prepare yourselves, relax, unwind,

03:02:52.500 --> 03:02:58.327
"set up your rooms. You're to stay for a few days
at the very least. But we shall call you when the

03:02:58.327 --> 03:03:04.130
"meal is ready." At which Lord Sylas Briarwood
turns to him and says, "I greatly appreciate the

03:03:04.130 --> 03:03:08.946
"information. Just come to our room and let us know
when the food is ready. Now, come, my dear"

03:03:08.946 --> 03:03:14.795
LAURA: Can I keep an eye on them as they're
walking to their room? Just as long as I can see

03:03:14.795 --> 03:03:17.574
their mouths moving, I can read their lips.

03:03:17.574 --> 03:03:20.961
TALIESIN: I also want to scan their entourage to
see if I recognize any faces.

03:03:20.961 --> 03:03:24.475
MATT: Okay, perception check. Perception check for
you, as well.

03:03:24.475 --> 03:03:29.137
LAURA: Do I have to perceive it? I have a feat
that I can read it.

03:03:29.137 --> 03:03:30.322
MATT: Oh, you do?

03:03:30.322 --> 03:03:35.569
LAURA: Yeah, I have Observant: Read Lips meaning I
can read lips from any language I can understand.

03:03:35.569 --> 03:03:36.810
MATT: That's true. Okay, good to know.

03:03:36.810 --> 03:03:38.060
TALIESIN: 19.

03:03:38.060 --> 03:03:43.420
MATT: 19. No, they all appear to be run of the
mill soldiers, nothing, no one that catches your

03:03:43.420 --> 03:03:51.539
attention. The young man who is helping them as
they go through seems familiar, but no one that is

03:03:51.539 --> 03:03:57.106
jumping out at you right now. Someone you may have
crossed paths with in the past but nobody that's

03:03:57.106 --> 03:04:02.015
really been formally involved in your life
previously. Maybe a denizen of Whitestone that

03:04:02.015 --> 03:04:07.365
you've crossed before when he was younger. As they
walk up the steps, you keep an eye best you can as

03:04:07.365 --> 03:04:12.577
they go. You catch a little bit of conversation
that seems to speak about how long the journey's

03:04:12.577 --> 03:04:18.221
been, "That's all right, we'll be in there soon to
discuss and we'll be out as soon as we can. We

03:04:18.221 --> 03:04:21.606
"won't stay any longer than we need to." And that's
the extent you gather as they continue up the

03:04:21.606 --> 03:04:27.957
stairway. As the next hour or so passes?

03:04:27.957 --> 03:04:30.396
ORION: I flirt with Allura.

03:04:30.396 --> 03:04:32.775
MATT: Okay, do you want to talk with Allura?

03:04:32.775 --> 03:04:35.437
ORION: I flirt with her throughout the hour.

03:04:35.437 --> 03:04:42.493
MATT: Okay, she's grateful for the conversation.
She laughs, and she's very attentive to all of you

03:04:42.493 --> 03:04:47.253
and excited to see you. She lets you know that
she's been caught in a little bit of the

03:04:47.253 --> 03:04:51.907
bureaucracy in the city and despises that. She's
taken some time off for herself

03:04:51.907 --> 03:04:53.682
for about a week or so.

03:04:53.682 --> 03:04:56.036
ORION: Actually, towards the end of that
conversation I would like to bring up a specific

03:04:56.036 --> 03:04:59.068
thing. We've been having such a wonderful
conversation.

03:04:59.068 --> 03:05:01.188
MATT: "Of course, no, of course, Tiberius"

03:05:01.188 --> 03:05:07.829
ORION: I think when things settle down a bit,
perhaps you and I and maybe Grog, and Lady Kima

03:05:07.829 --> 03:05:17.653
can perhaps go out. Break bread and have some wine
and such on an evening with each other. I believe

03:05:17.653 --> 03:05:22.751
my friend rather fancies Kima. What say you?

03:05:22.751 --> 03:05:35.886
MATT: "Well, that's very flattering, Tiberius. I
appreciate the invitation. I would say that

03:05:35.886 --> 03:05:39.122
"particular mix of company might prove a bit
awkward."

03:05:39.122 --> 03:05:48.775
ORION: Well, of course. If it was awkward, nobody
wants that.

03:05:48.775 --> 03:05:51.412
MATT: "Perhaps we might-- I mean if you would like
to get some tea sometime

03:05:51.412 --> 03:05:52.702
"I'd be more than happy to--"

03:05:52.702 --> 03:05:54.253
ORION: Oh, just you and I?

03:05:54.253 --> 03:05:59.901
MATT: "Yes. Kima's quite a ways off and I believe
she's still in Vasselheim, last I spoke with her,

03:05:59.901 --> 03:06:04.920
"and yes, tea would be lovely."

03:06:04.920 --> 03:06:09.307
ORION: Okay, all right, wonderful.

03:06:09.307 --> 03:06:11.653
SAM: You walk away.

03:06:11.653 --> 03:06:13.215
ORION: I walk away.

03:06:13.215 --> 03:06:18.084
(laughter)

03:06:18.084 --> 03:06:20.058
MARISHA: He got a date!

03:06:20.058 --> 03:06:22.954
TRAVIS: Is that carriage. Is the carriage still
there?

03:06:22.954 --> 03:06:27.273
MATT: The carriage, as far as you see, is being
led off slowly by the

03:06:27.273 --> 03:06:30.512
servants to a side area of the palace.

03:06:30.512 --> 03:06:35.773
TRAVIS: And the armed on horseback that were with
the Briarwoods when they came in?

03:06:35.773 --> 03:06:41.038
MATT: Two of them are with the Briarwoods, and
there are two helping

03:06:41.038 --> 03:06:43.318
to bring their stuff up to their rooms.

03:06:43.318 --> 03:06:45.008
TRAVIS: The four are with them?

03:06:45.008 --> 03:06:46.717
MATT: The four are with them, yes.

03:06:46.717 --> 03:06:57.805
SAM: I jump up and give him a little high five.
Then, as an hour has passed, I beckon to Vax and

03:06:57.805 --> 03:06:59.947
find a shadowy area.

03:06:59.947 --> 03:07:01.526
TRAVIS: Real Vax or Vaxy?

03:07:01.526 --> 03:07:07.577
SAM: Real Vax. Because my thing is wearing off,
buddy.

03:07:07.577 --> 03:07:13.789
MARISHA: I've been scanning the crowd. Have I
noticed anything over the past hour of any of our

03:07:13.789 --> 03:07:19.515
people? Any locals, any council members, who may
be acting a little shifty?

03:07:19.515 --> 03:07:25.248
MATT: Looking about, the council is roughly
stepping in and out of the area like they're

03:07:25.248 --> 03:07:28.461
getting ready for the dinner and arriving from the
Cloudtop district.

03:07:28.461 --> 03:07:32.810
MARISHA: Any of them breaking a sweat? Acting
weird?

03:07:32.810 --> 03:07:35.260
LAURA: Yeah. I want to check out this, too.

03:07:35.260 --> 03:07:38.958
MATT: Go ahead and make an insight roll, both of
you guys.

03:07:38.958 --> 03:07:43.366
MARISHA: 22.

03:07:43.366 --> 03:07:49.247
LAURA: 23.

03:07:49.247 --> 03:07:56.472
MATT: The two of you scanning over. Looking over
there is Lord Riskel Daxio, he's an elven male,

03:07:56.472 --> 03:08:00.991
who was the one who is master of trade of the
city. He's the one that handled the ordering of

03:08:00.991 --> 03:08:10.002
your keep when you first had it brought to your
attention by Uriel. Allura, of course. Tofor

03:08:10.002 --> 03:08:17.492
Brotorus is there, the female dragonborn paladin.
She seems generally just not happy about the whole

03:08:17.492 --> 03:08:25.314
scenario and she's not armored, she's dressed in
what would be considered formal attire but it's

03:08:25.314 --> 03:08:34.105
not a dress, it's not a suit, it's this asexual
formal outfit that looks like a robe but also like

03:08:34.105 --> 03:08:39.256
a suit and she does not look to be happy in it at
all. Just arms crossed, at the far end, back

03:08:39.256 --> 03:08:46.110
against the wall just (growling noises) slowly
stewing, not wanting to be there. You also see

03:08:46.110 --> 03:08:51.852
Arbiter Brom Goldhand, who is the master of law.
Was previously one of the heads of the guard there

03:08:51.852 --> 03:08:58.124
within Emon and then was then given the job of
being the head of the Watchful Hall. He's the

03:08:58.124 --> 03:09:07.868
master of law essentially in the city. That's
right, Tofor is the master of defense that took

03:09:07.868 --> 03:09:12.351
over for Krieg after Krieg was slain. So those are
the council members. Most everyone else there you

03:09:12.351 --> 03:09:17.878
see are servants. As time goes on eventually there
is the ringing of a dinner bell down the hallway

03:09:17.878 --> 03:09:24.992
and everyone turns their head and notices and
steps over to the great hall of the palace where

03:09:24.992 --> 03:09:29.204
the feast is to be given to you and other guests.

03:09:29.204 --> 03:09:34.994
SAM: As we move, I release and then recast
Invisibility on him when I see that there's a

03:09:34.994 --> 03:09:37.321
moment where everyone's distracted.

03:09:37.321 --> 03:09:40.584
MATT: All righty, so you rejuvenate the
Invisibility spell.

03:09:40.584 --> 03:09:43.763
MARISHA: Oh look, Tiberius, they have bananas!

03:09:43.763 --> 03:09:45.197
ORION: Oh!

03:09:45.197 --> 03:09:50.474
LAURA: I can sense you, you dick.

03:09:50.474 --> 03:09:59.724
MATT: You're escorted to the hall by Allura. She
keeps chatting with you guys and asking questions

03:09:59.724 --> 03:10:06.667
about how Vasselheim was, and is Kima well? She
stayed back there. She asks questions about why

03:10:06.667 --> 03:10:09.727
Pike isn't here and you tell her the story that
she stayed behind and everything. You make your

03:10:09.727 --> 03:10:15.514
way into the great hall which seats a vast number
of people. There are five major tables meant for

03:10:15.514 --> 03:10:20.214
like large feasts but there is one central square
table in the far end that is by this giant hearth.

03:10:20.214 --> 03:10:27.106
This fireplace is probably a good six feet high
and about 12 feet wide. It's a grandiose visual on

03:10:27.106 --> 03:10:32.027
the far end of this hall, and there's a long table
right there set for about 20 people. You don't

03:10:32.027 --> 03:10:36.310
know if there will be that many there at the table
but it can seat that many. At which point, all the

03:10:36.310 --> 03:10:41.317
different members of the council have their seats
around it. You guys find your seats.

03:10:41.317 --> 03:10:43.784
LAURA: Can we get a feel for where the Briarwoods
are going to sit?

03:10:43.784 --> 03:10:48.318
MATT: With this many seats set, it's hard to tell,
but you gather

03:10:48.318 --> 03:10:50.203
that they're probably going to sit--

03:10:50.203 --> 03:10:52.557
LAURA: Are there place cards? (laughs)

03:10:52.557 --> 03:10:54.490
MATT: There are no place cards but there are two
ends of the table

03:10:54.490 --> 03:10:56.749
that have two chairs at each end.

03:10:56.749 --> 03:11:03.284
LAURA: Okay. Can I position myself when I sit to
where I can see them?

03:11:03.284 --> 03:11:07.521
So I can read their mouths, specifically.

03:11:07.521 --> 03:11:10.522
MATT: Certainly. You can probably sit on the
center or the far end of the table looking in

03:11:10.522 --> 03:11:12.147
their direction, should be fine.

03:11:12.147 --> 03:11:15.875
ORION: Can I sit at the far end of the table at
the very opposite end,

03:11:15.875 --> 03:11:17.802
if not at head of the end--

03:11:17.802 --> 03:11:20.117
LAURA: That's probably where Uriel is going to
sit.

03:11:20.117 --> 03:11:21.611
ORION: Oh. Who?

03:11:21.611 --> 03:11:22.690
TRAVIS: The king.

03:11:22.690 --> 03:11:24.007
ORION: Oh! Not that chair.

03:11:24.007 --> 03:11:25.387
MATT: Okay, but adjacent to it?

03:11:25.387 --> 03:11:27.360
ORION: Yes. That would be rude, I think.

03:11:27.360 --> 03:11:28.469
MATT: Okay, fair enough.

03:11:28.469 --> 03:11:32.211
SAM: I assume I sit at the kiddie table because
I'm so tiny?

03:11:32.211 --> 03:11:33.907
LAURA: They've got a booster chair for you,
Scanlan.

03:11:33.907 --> 03:11:41.869
MATT: They do have adjustments for gnomish
guests-- is a way of putting it. All right, after

03:11:41.869 --> 03:11:51.344
you guys sit for a few moments, another servant
steps forward and says, "Please, if we might rise

03:11:51.344 --> 03:11:54.343
"for our guests Lord and Lady Briarwood to join us
at the table--"

03:11:54.343 --> 03:11:58.363
SAM: I am risen already. I'm standing already.

03:11:58.363 --> 03:12:05.875
MATT: Lord and Lady Briarwood now enter arm in
arm, slowly walking from the far end of the great

03:12:05.875 --> 03:12:10.881
hall. They make their way to one end of the table.
They both wordlessly sit down, smiling and

03:12:10.881 --> 03:12:16.719
acknowledge everyone at the table. There's a
moment of silence and then another servant says

03:12:16.719 --> 03:12:26.848
"And would all please attention be given to our
sovereign Uriel Tal'Dorei the second and the

03:12:26.848 --> 03:12:32.796
"Empress Salda Tal'Dorei." At which point, the
sovereign and his wife enter from the same

03:12:32.796 --> 03:12:36.834
entrance point. Everyone stands up from their
chair, waits for them to get to the edge of the

03:12:36.834 --> 03:12:41.967
table, at which point they nod their head. Everyone
gives a low bow. You guys follow suit, following

03:12:41.967 --> 03:12:45.290
the social graces you're not familiar with but
trying to learn as you go. Except for Tiberius,

03:12:45.290 --> 03:12:53.638
you know this deal. You all follow his lead on
this. Eventually, everyone sits down again. Tables

03:12:53.638 --> 03:12:58.045
are pushed in by servants behind you, you're like
'oh' caught off guard by the whole experience.

03:12:58.045 --> 03:13:07.551
Uriel looks about the table with a smile, shoulder
length brown hair and his chin goatee very well

03:13:07.551 --> 03:13:15.144
crafted into almost a point now. He looks about
the table. "Thank you, Lord and Lady Briarwood,

03:13:15.144 --> 03:13:21.819
"for making the journey across the lands so that we
might meet in person, finally. Please, allow me to

03:13:21.819 --> 03:13:28.642
"introduce our dining party and esteemed council of
Tal'Dorei." He goes around the table introducing,

03:13:28.642 --> 03:13:34.341
"Arbiter Brom Goldhand. He is the master of law of
our city, and is responsible for maintaining all

03:13:34.341 --> 03:13:44.363
"of these grand people of our fair town in the
realm of safety and order. We have Lord Riskel

03:13:44.363 --> 03:13:50.450
"Daxio. He is our head of planning and
construction; has overseen many of the expansions

03:13:50.450 --> 03:13:58.615
"of the city, and is a trusted friend of mine. We
have the Arcanist Allura Vysoren: one of my

03:13:58.615 --> 03:14:05.805
"trusted advisors, one of the greatest arcane minds
of all of Tal'Dorei, and the overseer of all

03:14:05.805 --> 03:14:14.763
"things arcane within our city. We have the
Guardian Tofor Brotorus, a fierce warrior and

03:14:14.763 --> 03:14:23.985
"currently the master of defense in our city and
hopefully for a long time to come." Tofor gives a

03:14:23.985 --> 03:14:32.964
(scoffs) sound and everyone is put off by it, but
they're also seemingly used to it. "Arbiter Brom

03:14:32.964 --> 03:14:42.076
"Goldhand: master of law. My lovely wife, the
Empress Salda. We have here within our midst, as

03:14:42.076 --> 03:14:50.521
"well: Vox Machina, a team of intrepid adventurers
who rose up and saved my family's life and very

03:14:50.521 --> 03:14:57.824
"well the city of Emon and have since proven very
useful to our territory. Grog Strongjaw, a goliath

03:14:57.824 --> 03:15:10.562
"of interesting dress, but strong of heart and
blade. We have Vex'halia, half-elven maiden with a

03:15:10.562 --> 03:15:23.025
"bow as swift as the fastest eagle." Looking next,
he says, "We have here Vax'ildan, blades quick and

03:15:23.025 --> 03:15:34.607
"eyes sharp, not a whisper passes his ear. Ah!
There you are! Scanlan Shorthalt, a performer

03:15:34.607 --> 03:15:40.731
"known far and wide. A wit as clever as you've ever
seen. His songs are whispered through taverns

03:15:40.731 --> 03:15:45.762
"across the land. We have Tiberius Stormwind--"

03:15:45.762 --> 03:15:47.452
ORION: I'm from Draconia.

03:15:47.452 --> 03:15:56.943
MATT: "Hailing from Draconia, which," he looks
across to the Briarwoods, "the kingdom you hail

03:15:56.943 --> 03:16:00.313
"from originally not being far off from Draconia,
perhaps you've had some

03:16:00.313 --> 03:16:02.066
"dealings with the Stormwinds?"

03:16:02.066 --> 03:16:07.529
And the Briarwoods give a nod. "Yes, we have seen
them in the past. We've heard many good things."

03:16:07.529 --> 03:16:09.994
ORION: We're pretty cool.

03:16:09.994 --> 03:16:20.780
MATT: "We have over here, Keyleth of the Ashari,
if I am correct on that? She is a denizen of the

03:16:20.780 --> 03:16:26.224
"natural lands and protector of all things nature
within Tal'Dorei."

03:16:26.224 --> 03:16:28.617
MARISHA: Hi.

03:16:28.617 --> 03:16:31.013
MATT: "There was one more."

03:16:31.013 --> 03:16:33.610
TALIESIN: Two, and they could not be in
attendance.

03:16:33.610 --> 03:16:34.960
LAURA: Yes, ill.

03:16:34.960 --> 03:16:39.954
ORION: They were running around. They got
diarrhea. Isn't that what you said?

03:16:39.954 --> 03:16:41.624
SAM: Yes.

03:16:41.624 --> 03:16:53.489
MATT: "Anyway. Welcome, and thank you." He reaches
over and takes a small glass and clinks it with

03:16:53.489 --> 03:16:56.825
his silverware, the servants immediately muster up
and start pulling glasses out and pouring wine

03:16:56.825 --> 03:17:01.308
into everyone's glasses and the conversation
begins to naturally bustle about for this meal.

03:17:01.308 --> 03:17:09.501
Immediately conversation builds in about Uriel
talking across to the Briarwoods talking about the

03:17:09.501 --> 03:17:15.604
bridge. He says "Now, the Uriel bridge, I don't
think the name was necessary, but it's appreciated

03:17:15.604 --> 03:17:23.106
"from my perspective. Now in this union between
Wildemount and Tal'Dorei-- do we have a confirmed

03:17:23.106 --> 03:17:24.672
"trade route between the two?"

03:17:24.672 --> 03:17:30.028
At which Lord Briarwood returns, "This is indeed
very true. We are hoping that through this

03:17:30.028 --> 03:17:37.666
"passageway, we'd have means of rather quick trade
between this kingdom and yours. Not to mention

03:17:37.666 --> 03:17:46.007
"this would allow for individuals to travel for
carried parcels very quickly and we're hoping to

03:17:46.007 --> 03:17:51.898
"establish perhaps a very quick means of
communication outside of the arcane for those who

03:17:51.898 --> 03:17:54.258
"cannot afford these various luxuries."

03:17:54.258 --> 03:18:03.577
Lady Briarwood taps on his shoulder and says, "Yes,
and by the way, I don't mean to bring up a sore

03:18:03.577 --> 03:18:07.283
"subject but it's come to our attention that
apparently last Winter's Crest, there was an

03:18:07.283 --> 03:18:15.745
"attempt on your life," and the table gets a little
quiet for a second. "We're sorry to hear that and

03:18:15.745 --> 03:18:17.280
"wish to express our--"

03:18:17.280 --> 03:18:23.381
Uriel puts his hand out and says, "No, no, it's
quite all right. It was but a paltry attempt, and

03:18:23.381 --> 03:18:31.393
"it was thwarted actually by Vox Machina. They have
been tremendous in keeping us safe and I greatly

03:18:31.393 --> 03:18:34.880
"appreciate their aid in overseeing my family's
good fortune." Yes?

03:18:34.880 --> 03:18:45.681
LIAM: While all this is going on, can you
describe. Are the Briarwood couple together,

03:18:45.681 --> 03:18:46.857
seated next to each other?

03:18:46.857 --> 03:18:49.888
MATT: They are seated right next to each other at
the head of one table across the way.

03:18:49.888 --> 03:18:54.184
LIAM: I intend to be behind them, but what's
behind them, like?

03:18:54.184 --> 03:18:57.377
MATT: What's behind them is just open space and
servants. There's probably a good 25 servants here

03:18:57.377 --> 03:19:00.175
that are just like sitting there patiently, lying
in wait for--

03:19:00.175 --> 03:19:06.088
LIAM: And behind the servants is a wall so there's
lots of open busy crowded space? Okay.

03:19:06.088 --> 03:19:09.772
MATT: And tables. There's like other unused tables
in this great hall that are just out there.

03:19:09.772 --> 03:19:11.104
Four other ones.

03:19:11.104 --> 03:19:19.362
LIAM: All right. I'm going to drink the potion of
climbing that Grog gave me, and I'm spidering up

03:19:19.362 --> 03:19:29.532
the wall and I'd love, while listening to all this
to make an insight check on them just as they

03:19:29.532 --> 03:19:31.508
talk, just for funsies.

03:19:31.508 --> 03:19:33.173
MATT: To inquire about--?

03:19:33.173 --> 03:19:36.392
LIAM: Just to see if they seem like sacks of
shit.

03:19:36.392 --> 03:19:37.954
MATT: Okay, go for it.

03:19:37.954 --> 03:19:47.250
LIAM: Luck, oh not that lucky. This is going to be
very low. Yeah, never mind, low. Very low.

03:19:47.250 --> 03:19:53.601
MATT: It's hard to tell from this distance really
at all. They're very charming. You were expecting

03:19:53.601 --> 03:20:02.280
this very dour, dark, evil couple from all the
conversation, but they seem nice. They seem

03:20:02.280 --> 03:20:07.082
earnest. They keep to themselves definitely,
they're definitely a very tight couple but nothing

03:20:07.082 --> 03:20:12.843
about them catches you off guard as being anything
instinctively twisted.

03:20:12.843 --> 03:20:15.833
LIAM: It's very hard to read them upside-down.

03:20:15.833 --> 03:20:18.898
LAURA: Could I inquire to Lady Briarwood?

03:20:18.898 --> 03:20:24.400
MATT: You're saying this out loud? The
conversation comes to a halt, she-- "Yes, of course.

03:20:24.400 --> 03:20:26.729
"I'm so sorry, what was your name again?"

03:20:26.729 --> 03:20:27.975
LAURA: Vex'ahlia.

03:20:27.975 --> 03:20:30.582
MATT: "Vex'ahlia. Absolute pleasure to meet you.
Delilah."

03:20:30.582 --> 03:20:36.975
LAURA: You as well. I notice your dress is quite
lovely. It doesn't look like a fashion that I'm

03:20:36.975 --> 03:20:39.670
used to seeing. Where do you hail from
originally?

03:20:39.670 --> 03:20:44.717
MATT: "We hail from Wildemount. It's quite a ways
from here. The continent to the far east."

03:20:44.717 --> 03:20:46.489
LAURA: Really, I'm not familiar.

03:20:46.489 --> 03:20:50.255
MATT: "You should come by sometime. We haven't
been home in a number of years, having to tend to

03:20:50.255 --> 03:20:57.264
"Whitestone, but we have quite an elaborate
homestead there. We'd love to have you come stay

03:20:57.264 --> 03:20:59.810
"with us if you ever find yourself in that side of
the world."

03:20:59.810 --> 03:21:03.151
LAURA: I would love to visit. How long have you
been at Whitestone?

03:21:03.151 --> 03:21:07.863
MATT: "We've been at Whitestone for the better
part of-- I can't even remember."

03:21:07.863 --> 03:21:16.351
And Lord Briarwood looks, he goes, "Best I can
recall, four or five years. It was an unfortunate

03:21:16.351 --> 03:21:22.183
"mantle to pick up but we've done what we can in
honor of the passed de Rolo family."

03:21:22.183 --> 03:21:25.738
SAM: Oh, sorry.

03:21:25.738 --> 03:21:31.905
ORION: I was just going to ask, you seem such a
lovely couple. Do you have any children?

03:21:32.051 --> 03:21:41.843
MATT: "We unfortunately do not. It seems it was
not in the cards for us to bear. However, we

03:21:41.843 --> 03:21:52.401
"consider many of our esteemed servants and house
guests our extended family. So we can leave a

03:21:52.401 --> 03:21:55.321
"legacy, however we can possibly do so."

03:21:55.321 --> 03:21:57.879
LAURA: Can we insight check as, what they're
saying?

03:21:57.879 --> 03:22:00.655
MATT: Certainly.

03:22:00.655 --> 03:22:07.546
LAURA: I mean, I know they're lying out their
asses. Fuck. 18.

03:22:07.546 --> 03:22:09.830
MATT: 18? Seems pretty earnest.

03:22:09.830 --> 03:22:14.348
SAM: Lord Briarwood. Down here, hi.

03:22:14.348 --> 03:22:19.197
MATT: "I'm sorry, I--" he snaps and a servant
moves a large like pig platter out of the way that

03:22:19.197 --> 03:22:20.857
was blocking your head from his vision.

03:22:20.857 --> 03:22:23.128
TRAVIS: You can move that over here actually,
thank you. (chomping noises)

03:22:23.128 --> 03:22:31.446
SAM: Lord Briarwood, we may share a mutual friend
or acquaintance of some sort. My father was a

03:22:31.446 --> 03:22:41.259
prominent doctor, and he may have studied medicine
with a fellow that you know named Dr. Ripulah,

03:22:41.259 --> 03:22:44.689
Ripley? Dr. Ripley? Do you know such a person?

03:22:44.689 --> 03:22:50.143
MATT: "Yes, actually. Dr. Ripley is one of our
esteemed physicians in Whitestone. Yes, recently

03:22:50.143 --> 03:22:55.910
"come into some land herself, although she has been
on holiday for some time. Following her own

03:22:55.910 --> 03:22:58.034
"research as doctors are wont to do."

03:22:58.034 --> 03:23:00.346
SAM: Are you close with her?

03:23:00.346 --> 03:23:05.604
MATT: "I wouldn't say close, but she's been a
friend at times, and she was one of the few that

03:23:05.604 --> 03:23:13.969
"came with us from Wildemount over to Whitestone and
has helped us restructure and maintain and help

03:23:13.969 --> 03:23:17.738
"facilitate the blossoming of a city without a
leader."

03:23:17.738 --> 03:23:22.481
SAM: She sounds wonderful. Well, when you see her
next tell her that my father,

03:23:22.481 --> 03:23:27.397
Dr. Jeff Shorthalt, said hi.

03:23:27.397 --> 03:23:30.645
MATT: "Jeff Shorthalt, I will be happy to pass
that along."

03:23:30.645 --> 03:23:35.062
TALIESIN: Lord Briarwood, I am not familiar with
Whitestone.

03:23:35.062 --> 03:23:40.596
How did you become caretaker of such a place?

03:23:40.596 --> 03:23:47.734
MATT: At which point, one of the other council
members goes, "Um." and puts his hand out.

03:23:47.734 --> 03:24:03.645
"It's all right," and he pats the hand of his
wife. He looks over at you with a smile. "We know

03:24:03.645 --> 03:24:16.419
"not if it is connected with the disease, but
before all this occurred, we became very close

03:24:16.419 --> 03:24:29.175
"friends with the de Rolo family about ten or so
years ago. Actually, the first time we met is an

03:24:29.175 --> 03:24:31.739
"interesting tale, if you want to tell it,
please."

03:24:31.739 --> 03:24:40.686
His wife goes, "All right all right, so they were
taking a brief vacation east to Wildemount.

03:24:40.686 --> 03:24:45.082
"Apparently, they had not traveled and they brought
their family with them, a whole gaggle of small

03:24:45.082 --> 03:24:51.623
"children. They were coming this direction. Now our
homestead is on the western outskirts of Wildemount

03:24:51.623 --> 03:24:57.171
"so one of the first places you traverse before
going into the kingdom proper. However, the

03:24:57.171 --> 03:25:02.589
"family, the de Rolo family had been caught in a
bad downpour, a storm that had blown in and made

03:25:02.589 --> 03:25:09.649
"travel rather impossible, and apparently they
stopped not far from our homestead. They came to

03:25:09.649 --> 03:25:15.250
"our front door asking for shelter for the evening,
and we were happy to house them. We gave them dry

03:25:15.250 --> 03:25:21.488
"clothes, food for the night, and well, a rather
fast friendship was forged. As we quickly began to

03:25:21.488 --> 03:25:27.266
"notice they weren't just rabble of the street,
they themselves were highborn as we were and in a

03:25:27.266 --> 03:25:32.271
"very dire circumstance. So we let them in, they
stayed for but a week. We showed them about the

03:25:32.271 --> 03:25:37.617
"western side of Wildemount and let them on their
way. And since then we've had many different years

03:25:37.617 --> 03:25:43.599
"we've spent together as families going on various
journeys and trips together. But as time went on

03:25:43.599 --> 03:25:52.531
"we got busy on our own and separate ways and we
hadn't spoken in a while. They were in the process

03:25:52.531 --> 03:26:00.360
"of discussing the building of the Uriel bridge
about five years ago, and we were going to meet

03:26:00.360 --> 03:26:09.379
"with them about pursuing this venture as a joint--
well, when the disease took them. The family

03:26:09.379 --> 03:26:18.822
"passed on. We were surprised that they would've
considered leaving Whitestone in our name, and we

03:26:18.822 --> 03:26:26.204
"couldn't say no, at this point. To carry on their
legacy, I felt, was important enough let alone the

03:26:26.204 --> 03:26:34.965
"memory of that to carry on the building of this
Uriel bridge. I thought I really wanted to

03:26:34.965 --> 03:26:36.897
"spearhead the wishes of Frederick."

03:26:36.897 --> 03:26:40.364
ORION: That is so courageous of you. Do you want
me to Fireball her now?

03:26:40.364 --> 03:26:42.177
TALIESIN: A toast, then!

03:26:42.177 --> 03:26:45.335
MATT: "A toast."

03:26:45.335 --> 03:26:47.243
TALIESIN: To gracious hosts.

03:26:47.243 --> 03:26:49.437
MATT: "To gracious hosts."

03:26:49.437 --> 03:26:51.770
SAM: L'Chaim.

03:26:51.770 --> 03:26:54.416
ORION: Gesundheit.

03:26:54.416 --> 03:27:10.915
MATT: "So. Uriel," and he looks across the way and
says, "one of our largest exports in Whitestone is

03:27:10.915 --> 03:27:19.139
"timber from the forests and woods that surround
Whitestone and the Alabaster Sierras. We've had a

03:27:19.139 --> 03:27:25.597
"rising danger in the surrounding woods. It has
made it proven difficult to export most of these

03:27:25.597 --> 03:27:33.763
"wooded goods. If it is possible, we would like for
you to send some aid, perhaps a small band of

03:27:33.763 --> 03:27:36.301
"soldiers to lead a strike into the woods."

03:27:36.301 --> 03:27:40.366
Uriel looks across the way and says, "Ah yes, we
can definitely discuss that, I don't see why not.

03:27:40.366 --> 03:27:43.248
"We are currently in peacetime and we have a
reserve of soldiers we can send your way."

03:27:43.248 --> 03:27:46.672
MARISHA: I mean, we're also free.

03:27:46.672 --> 03:27:50.502
SAM: Oh yes.

03:27:50.502 --> 03:28:01.005
MATT: As the meal continues on, more conversations
arise. A lot of bureaucratic BS. Anyone want to

03:28:01.005 --> 03:28:03.181
interject anything or ask any questions?

03:28:03.181 --> 03:28:04.887
ORION: Is Allura there, still?

03:28:04.887 --> 03:28:06.221
MATT: Allura is there, yes.

03:28:06.221 --> 03:28:15.440
ORION: As we're eating I'm going to: By the way,
did you ever perhaps finish making that extra

03:28:15.440 --> 03:28:21.885
earring I gave you several weeks ago? I don't know
how long it's been.

03:28:21.885 --> 03:28:26.818
MATT: Allura looks, glances over to the side and
says, "Yes, it's been completed. No one's come by

03:28:26.818 --> 03:28:28.158
"to take it from me"

03:28:28.158 --> 03:28:29.849
ORION: I had no idea, I'll send someone.

03:28:29.849 --> 03:28:35.820
MATT: "And as a note, I'm about a month away from
completing the sigil in the base mentof your keep."

03:28:35.820 --> 03:28:44.673
ORION: Oh, wonderful. Thank you, that's-- so
talented. What flavor tea do you like, Allura?

03:28:44.792 --> 03:28:48.589
MATT: "I prefer a mint or jasmine, to be honest."

03:28:48.589 --> 03:28:51.884
ORION: Noted. I walk away

03:28:51.884 --> 03:29:02.016
MATT: You step up and walk away from the dinner
table. (chair scraping) Tiberius stands up in the

03:29:02.016 --> 03:29:04.020
middle of the discussion and walks away from the
feast

03:29:04.020 --> 03:29:09.041
TALIESIN: Lady Briarwood, it is such an act of
compassion to take on such responsibility as a

03:29:09.041 --> 03:29:11.099
house such as Whitestone.

03:29:11.099 --> 03:29:12.713
SAM: Tiberius, get back here.

03:29:12.713 --> 03:29:13.867
ORION: You said walk away.

03:29:13.867 --> 03:29:15.161
SAM: No! Not every time!

03:29:15.161 --> 03:29:19.343
MATT: "Well, thank you. This is the first time
we've been away from Whitestone in many years."

03:29:19.343 --> 03:29:28.773
TALIESIN: That's such a spectacular act of
kindness and generosity. Would, perhaps, Vox

03:29:28.773 --> 03:29:31.353
Machina also be of service to you?

03:29:31.353 --> 03:29:38.256
MATT: "Perhaps, you seem strong of build and--"

03:29:38.256 --> 03:29:42.661
LAURA: We are handier than we look.

03:29:42.661 --> 03:29:44.934
MARISHA: We killed a beholder once.

03:29:44.934 --> 03:29:48.290
TRAVIS: Just right out with it.

03:29:48.290 --> 03:29:51.993
MATT: "That is an impressive feat, young
Keyleth."

03:29:51.993 --> 03:29:54.042
MARISHA: We should just lead with that.

03:29:54.042 --> 03:29:57.769
TALIESIN: And we killed an illithid once, as
well.

03:29:57.769 --> 03:30:02.920
MATT: "Slain a beholder? Uriel, you keep in the
presence of some mighty heroes."

03:30:02.920 --> 03:30:12.219
Uriel goes, (chuckles) "They are proven allies. I
mean, if you utilize their assistance. That would

03:30:12.219 --> 03:30:18.881
"be very possible. May have something coming up
that I could use them for myself, but we'll

03:30:18.881 --> 03:30:24.481
"discuss in time. Nevertheless, the meal
continues." She smiles and looks back at you.

03:30:24.481 --> 03:30:36.488
MARISHA: Can I do an insight check to see if that
look at Percy-not-Percy was--

03:30:36.488 --> 03:30:39.649
MATT: You can make an insight check, sure.

03:30:39.649 --> 03:30:43.576
TALIESIN: Can you? Can you make an insight check?
I don't think you can.

03:30:43.576 --> 03:30:45.337
MARISHA: She looked interesting.

03:30:45.337 --> 03:30:52.315
MATT: You're distracted by the pattern, the
brocade across her torso area.

03:30:52.315 --> 03:30:55.268
TALIESIN: You know, you could roll lower if you
tried.

03:30:55.268 --> 03:31:00.503
ORION: I want to do an arcana check on them.

03:31:00.503 --> 03:31:02.494
MATT: What are you checking for?

03:31:02.494 --> 03:31:09.063
ORION: If they're armed with anything that has
arcane properties.

03:31:09.063 --> 03:31:13.907
MATT: Make an arcana check. It's not so much
something you can sense, more than you can look

03:31:13.907 --> 03:31:21.247
for symbols. You rolled a 17? It looks like there
are elements of their accoutrements that are, like

03:31:21.247 --> 03:31:28.913
any of you are carrying on yourselves. There's a
choker that's part of the outfit that Lady

03:31:28.913 --> 03:31:34.322
Briarwood wears that itself does appear to have
some tiny enchantment-based markings across it.

03:31:34.322 --> 03:31:39.078
They are adorned in various protective magic, but
so is everybody else at the table.

03:31:39.078 --> 03:31:40.881
ORION: Got you. Standard gear.

03:31:40.881 --> 03:31:44.658
GROG: Lord and Lady Briarwood, we are, in fact,
quite handy.

03:31:44.658 --> 03:31:48.739
Vax, we also killed an illithid, if I recall.

03:31:48.739 --> 03:31:54.335
TALIESIN: I think we did. Did we befriend an
illithid or kill it? I think we did both.

03:31:54.335 --> 03:31:57.449
ORION: We befriended it, it betrayed us, and then
we killed it.

03:31:57.449 --> 03:32:05.495
SAM: But enough about us. Earlier, you were
telling us about a poor family that came down with

03:32:05.495 --> 03:32:11.685
that disease. I'm just curious, coming from a
medical family.

03:32:11.685 --> 03:32:16.124
What was the disease that they had?

03:32:16.124 --> 03:32:26.526
MATT: They look at each other and give a sorrowful
look. "We do not know. We were only given the

03:32:26.526 --> 03:32:31.843
"information that the family had passed, but a
month or two after it had already occurred."

03:32:31.843 --> 03:32:35.831
MARISHA: The entire family. All of them?

03:32:35.831 --> 03:32:39.542
MATT: "Most of the castle seemed to have fallen to
it, as well."

03:32:39.542 --> 03:32:40.980
LAURA: So dreadful.

03:32:40.980 --> 03:32:47.080
MATT: Uriel says, "My condolences, by the way. I
understand that's very hard."

03:32:47.080 --> 03:32:51.096
"It's all right. The least we could do is try to
carry on their legacy."

03:32:51.096 --> 03:32:56.735
LAURA: I know how hard it is to lose someone very
close to you. I'm sorry for your loss.

03:32:56.735 --> 03:33:02.257
MATT: "It's appreciated." He looks at his wife,
and she looks up for a second. "It's all right."

03:33:02.257 --> 03:33:13.283
MARISHA: I'm sorry. I'm just a little confused. If
the whole family died of disease, weren't you

03:33:13.283 --> 03:33:17.352
afraid to go into this town, into this castle?
Weren't you afraid of

03:33:17.352 --> 03:33:20.474
contracting this disease yourself?

03:33:20.474 --> 03:33:28.240
MATT: "There was worry of such a thing, but before
Whitestone castle could be entered, we made sure

03:33:28.240 --> 03:33:36.139
"to send in our best clerics to rid of any existing
possible lingering disease, and to make sure to

03:33:36.139 --> 03:33:40.284
"remove any corpses or bodies that may contain it.
There was a period of time that we were worried,

03:33:40.284 --> 03:33:48.212
"but after a few months, we came to the conclusion
that we were safe, and thus we moved our way in."

03:33:48.212 --> 03:33:50.677
TRAVIS: Lucky for you.

03:33:50.677 --> 03:33:57.497
SAM: Anyone care for some games of jenga?

03:33:57.497 --> 03:34:08.336
MATT: At this point, the dessert has been brought
out. It's a fine, almost creme brulee-type dish.

03:34:08.336 --> 03:34:09.542
It's delicious.

03:34:09.542 --> 03:34:14.930
LAURA: Are they whispering to themselves, still?

03:34:14.930 --> 03:34:23.754
MATT: As part of the discussions, there are a few
side exchanges here and there. The best you can

03:34:23.754 --> 03:34:29.081
make from it is, "Did you notice him?"

03:34:29.081 --> 03:34:42.320
She says, "Yes, don't worry." And, "Tonight, we'll
stay." And those are the only things you can make

03:34:42.320 --> 03:34:44.595
out from the exchanges back and forth.

03:34:44.595 --> 03:34:51.595
LAURA: How long do you plan on staying here, Lord
and Lady?

03:34:51.595 --> 03:35:00.010
MATT: "Well, after this dinner, I imagine a few
days, and we'll be on our way. We're merely here

03:35:00.010 --> 03:35:05.570
"to finalize the paperwork for the bridge
construction." She looks over and gives a nod to

03:35:05.570 --> 03:35:13.406
Lord Daxio, who gives her a nod back. "And maybe
see the city for a while, and make our way back.

03:35:13.406 --> 03:35:16.292
"It's too hard to be away, and our nephew has been
left in charge of this."

03:35:16.292 --> 03:35:22.063
LAURA: Do you have plans on the morrow? I would
love to give you a tour of the city.

03:35:22.063 --> 03:35:23.667
MATT: "That would be lovely."

03:35:23.667 --> 03:35:29.132
LAURA: Wonderful! Should I send word? How should
we arrange this?

03:35:29.132 --> 03:35:30.560
MATT: "Where are you staying?"

03:35:30.560 --> 03:35:34.593
LAURA: We are outside of town at our own keep,
actually.

03:35:34.593 --> 03:35:36.176
MATT: "What's it called?"

03:35:36.176 --> 03:35:38.997
LAURA: The Greyskull Keep.

03:35:38.997 --> 03:35:42.366
MATT: "Greyskull Keep. We will have you sent for
when the time is right."

03:35:42.366 --> 03:35:47.624
LAURA: Lovely. That will be so fun.

03:35:47.624 --> 03:35:53.129
ORION: Vex is so into showing people our city.

03:35:53.129 --> 03:35:57.118
LAURA: Perhaps you can show me some more of your
fashions. I love your dress so much.

03:35:57.118 --> 03:36:01.490
MATT: "Oh, well it's hard to show you this here.
What you need to see is the Wildemount fashion

03:36:01.490 --> 03:36:04.132
"district. It is divine."

03:36:04.132 --> 03:36:05.802
LAURA: Sounds wonderful.

03:36:05.802 --> 03:36:10.635
TRAVIS: I look at Vax and I go, does anyone want
any dessert?

03:36:10.635 --> 03:36:12.980
ORION: (gulping) I'm having a little.

03:36:12.980 --> 03:36:15.700
LAURA: Vax? You looked at Vax?

03:36:15.700 --> 03:36:21.262
TRAVIS: Yeah. Vaxy. The one that I can look at.

03:36:21.262 --> 03:36:30.725
ORION: Do you want dessert now? Would you like
this fireball creme brulee?

03:36:30.725 --> 03:36:32.239
TALIESIN: I'm just fine.

03:36:32.239 --> 03:36:34.603
MARISHA: (whispered) I don't know what to do now.

03:36:34.603 --> 03:36:39.239
MATT: The meal has been now wound down, the dishes
are being gathered by the servants, the wine has

03:36:39.239 --> 03:36:48.794
stopped being poured, and now everyone settles in
with sighs of a meal well spent. The other council

03:36:48.794 --> 03:36:54.187
members begin to excuse themselves. Uriel stands
up and says, "My apologies, me and my wife find

03:36:54.187 --> 03:37:01.362
"that rest is in our future. Please, feel free to
walk the halls as you see fit. Thank you again,

03:37:01.362 --> 03:37:06.272
"Lord and Lady Briarwood, for joining us, and we're
excited to continue this venture.

03:37:06.272 --> 03:37:08.526
"Good night to you all."

03:37:08.526 --> 03:37:10.746
MARISHA: Hey, you should Hunter's Mark them or
something.

03:37:10.746 --> 03:37:12.735
SAM: Wait, no, that's Uriel that's leaving.

03:37:12.735 --> 03:37:19.923
LIAM: What's the gentleman who realized that I was
there? Earlier, before we came in?

03:37:19.923 --> 03:37:24.032
MATT: Asum? He's not in the room. He's been
waiting in the foyer for you.

03:37:24.032 --> 03:37:28.716
LAURA: He was telling you to meet him in the
foyer, a long time ago.

03:37:28.716 --> 03:37:30.160
LIAM: Oh, that's all right.

03:37:30.160 --> 03:37:36.514
LAURA: (whispered) You should go spy on their
room. Go check out that room. I'll distract them.

03:37:36.514 --> 03:37:39.577
TRAVIS: (muffled) Go see if he's still there.

03:37:39.577 --> 03:37:47.896
MATT: Lord and Lady Briarwood also stand up. "On
that note as well, I think our meal has come to an

03:37:47.896 --> 03:37:52.586
"end. We appreciate your--" and Lady Briarwood
continues the sentence,

03:37:52.586 --> 03:37:55.460
"and we wish you all a fine night--"

03:37:55.460 --> 03:38:02.338
LIAM: I'm clicking my Boots of Haste and scuttling
along the ceiling back towards the door.

03:38:02.338 --> 03:38:11.261
ORION: I know a particular spell that it's rather
wonderful. And I go blow a stream out and do a

03:38:11.261 --> 03:38:17.570
cantrip, Control Magic, and start doing a nice
dragon fire dance that I know of from my home.

03:38:17.570 --> 03:38:19.369
SAM: I play a little flute.

03:38:19.369 --> 03:38:21.836
MATT: They both sit and watch for a moment--

03:38:21.836 --> 03:38:28.049
SAM: (Star Wars Cantina song)

03:38:28.049 --> 03:38:30.045
LIAM: Am I finding what's-his-face?

03:38:30.045 --> 03:38:33.763
MATT: You make your way out, and he's not there.
You don't see him anywhere.

03:38:33.763 --> 03:38:35.265
LIAM: I'm doubling back.

03:38:35.265 --> 03:38:41.615
MATT: Okay, you double back. After about a minute
of this, "Yes, well, thank you kindly for that

03:38:41.615 --> 03:38:47.408
"wondrous display. I feel that sleep takes us, and
we are going to retire to our quarters. Have a

03:38:47.408 --> 03:38:48.874
"wonderful night, everyone."

03:38:48.874 --> 03:38:50.394
MARISHA: Are you staying within the castle?

03:38:50.394 --> 03:38:51.535
MATT: "Yes, yes."

03:38:51.535 --> 03:38:54.042
MARISHA: Oh! Fantastic.

03:38:54.042 --> 03:38:55.333
ORION: Have a wonderful rest.

03:38:55.333 --> 03:39:00.462
MATT: "And good night." And they both stand up,
and then they make their way out, through the main

03:39:00.462 --> 03:39:02.056
great hall exit.

03:39:02.056 --> 03:39:03.418
LIAM: I'm following.

03:39:03.418 --> 03:39:10.630
MATT: Okay. You gather across the ceiling as you
go. You watch them head up the stairway to the

03:39:10.630 --> 03:39:17.422
second floor. They head to the right, down a long
hallway, a series of doors. They come up to a

03:39:17.422 --> 03:39:22.627
door, where there are two guards standing outside.
The same guards that led them inside the

03:39:22.627 --> 03:39:24.504
building, and were riding on horseback.

03:39:24.504 --> 03:39:26.746
LAURA: Could I Hunter's Mark him before they go in
their bedroom?

03:39:26.746 --> 03:39:31.027
MATT: Hunter's Mark is technically a minor spell.
You could try it.

03:39:31.027 --> 03:39:33.969
LAURA: I mean they're walking away, when their
back is turned, could I do it when they're not

03:39:33.969 --> 03:39:35.270
paying attention?

03:39:35.270 --> 03:39:42.718
MATT: I'd say, make a stealth check. Trying to do
this subtly at the table.

03:39:42.718 --> 03:39:43.816
LAURA: 20!

03:39:43.816 --> 03:39:45.862
(cheers)

03:39:45.862 --> 03:39:48.557
MATT: You Hunter's Mark which one?

03:39:48.557 --> 03:39:51.669
LAURA: Lord-- no--

03:39:51.669 --> 03:39:53.123
SAM: Sylas or Delilah?

03:39:53.123 --> 03:39:54.344
LAURA: Delilah.

03:39:54.344 --> 03:40:00.484
MATT: Okay, you mark Delilah as she walks off. You
have a sense of where she is at all times in the

03:40:00.484 --> 03:40:04.610
vicinity. As you follow them, they go to the door,
the guards open the door for them, and lead them

03:40:04.610 --> 03:40:06.482
into their room, and then close the door.

03:40:06.482 --> 03:40:14.322
LIAM: Oh, that fast? All right. How close to the
door are the guards? Right up against it?

03:40:14.322 --> 03:40:16.853
MATT: Not against it, but immediately to the right
and left of it.

03:40:16.853 --> 03:40:20.554
LAURA: I don't know what else to do, you guys.

03:40:20.554 --> 03:40:34.227
SAM: Burn their room down. We've got to find
Seeker Assam, or whatever his name is.

03:40:34.227 --> 03:40:41.845
LIAM: I yank off my serpent belt and throw it as
far as I can. Not as far as I can. 20 feet, and

03:40:41.845 --> 03:40:46.136
set it in motion, so there's now a snake in the
hall, 20 feet in front of these guys.

03:40:46.136 --> 03:40:56.744
MATT: All right. You take it, and you throw the
snake. Let me check one thing on Invisibility real

03:40:56.744 --> 03:40:59.488
fast. Just because--

03:40:59.488 --> 03:41:02.749
MARISHA: (laughs) Yeah, just, snake flies down
the hall--

03:41:02.749 --> 03:41:06.543
ORION: If he does an action, it dissipates the
spell. It's not Greater Invisibility, so he goes

03:41:06.543 --> 03:41:09.897
uninvisible, when he does something.

03:41:09.897 --> 03:41:17.767
MATT: "Attacks or casts a spell." It's not either
of those. It's activating an item. You take the

03:41:17.767 --> 03:41:22.381
belt (whoosh), fling it (hissing), the snake
appears to the side. One of the guards looks over.

03:41:22.381 --> 03:41:27.873
Looks over at the other guard, he pulls out his
weapon and one of the guards steps over to where

03:41:27.873 --> 03:41:33.622
the serpent is and starts trying to stomp it out,
and it nips up and gets some of the armor, and

03:41:33.622 --> 03:41:35.397
he's just, stomping out the snake.

03:41:35.397 --> 03:41:36.783
LIAM: So one's 20 feet away now?

03:41:36.783 --> 03:41:38.374
MATT: About 25 feet away, yeah.

03:41:38.374 --> 03:41:39.754
LIAM: 25 feet away, and one guy stayed?

03:41:39.754 --> 03:41:41.561
MATT: Yeah.

03:41:41.561 --> 03:41:43.128
SAM: Kill them.

03:41:43.128 --> 03:41:47.007
LIAM: I drop, and I'm going to bean him on the
head, like his name is Kynan.

03:41:47.007 --> 03:41:53.340
MATT: Okay! All right. As you leap off the top,
you (whoosh) land on the ground.

03:41:53.340 --> 03:41:55.348
Go ahead and roll an attack.

03:41:55.348 --> 03:41:59.775
LIAM: Okay. "Advantage on attack rolls against any
creature that hasn't taken a turn in combat yet."

03:41:59.775 --> 03:42:01.606
MATT: And he is surprised, because he does not
know you're there.

03:42:01.606 --> 03:42:14.343
LIAM: And I'm invisible, so that's an 18. That is
29 to hit. Using the blunt end! I just want to

03:42:14.343 --> 03:42:15.657
knock him out.

03:42:15.657 --> 03:42:18.449
MATT: Right, okay. Go ahead and roll sneak attack
damage.

03:42:18.449 --> 03:42:37.162
LIAM: Doubled. 12, 17, 23, 24, 26, so 52. Plus--
No, I mean, if I am as skilled a rogue as I am,

03:42:37.162 --> 03:42:44.638
how could I not just want to knock somebody out,
and not unintentionally-- ten. On top of the 52.

03:42:44.638 --> 03:42:51.682
MATT: 62 damage will do it. You (whack) right to
the side of the helmet, with a dull (thud) sound.

03:42:51.682 --> 03:42:54.376
Just falls like a sack of potatoes right against
the wall.

03:42:54.376 --> 03:42:56.397
LIAM: Hand on the door. Is it locked?

03:42:56.397 --> 03:43:03.204
MATT: The door is currently not locked. You can
see the guard you just knocked out, had the key in

03:43:03.204 --> 03:43:07.195
his hand and was in the process of going to lock
the door right when that happened.

03:43:07.195 --> 03:43:15.130
LIAM: Okay, so I flip my hood over my head, and I
quietly go in the door.

03:43:15.130 --> 03:43:17.758
SAM: Oh wait, you're not invisible anymore.

03:43:17.758 --> 03:43:19.188
LIAM: Yeah, I know.

03:43:19.188 --> 03:43:24.052
MATT: Okay. So. (creak) You open the door and
enter the room, closing it behind you. As soon as

03:43:24.052 --> 03:43:30.761
you enter the room, it's a large guest room. There
are two windows across the way with curtains drawn

03:43:30.761 --> 03:43:36.904
to the side. You can see the darkness of the night
sky behind that, and the rest of the low-lit

03:43:36.904 --> 03:43:42.522
Cloudtop District visible, and the courtyard
surrounding the palace. Immediately to the right

03:43:42.522 --> 03:43:46.774
and left of you, you see two large tables that are
covered in black cloths, that are just, tables to

03:43:46.774 --> 03:43:51.895
be, you know, vases and stuff set up on them.
One's clean, one has actual decor on it. There are

03:43:51.895 --> 03:43:56.587
two wooden tables immediately to the right and
left of you. There's a large red rug, central to

03:43:56.587 --> 03:44:02.963
the floor, that is circular, and on the far
corners next to the two windows you see armoires,

03:44:02.963 --> 03:44:09.678
like dressers, for clothing and such. In the
center of the room, you see, on top of the rug,

03:44:09.678 --> 03:44:15.574
against the wall between the two windows is a
large canopy bed, very beautifully carved from

03:44:15.574 --> 03:44:22.617
dark wood, has a purple cloth silk canopy that
drifts down around it. And on the far end, you can

03:44:22.617 --> 03:44:27.300
see now, against one of the tables, is Lady
Briarwood is currently taking jewelry off of one

03:44:27.300 --> 03:44:33.765
of her arms while Lord Briarwood is right by the
bed, holding on to the post, like he's just walked

03:44:33.765 --> 03:44:35.157
over to that area.

03:44:35.157 --> 03:44:36.332
LIAM: They're both at the bed?

03:44:36.332 --> 03:44:37.438
MATT: They're both at the bed.

03:44:37.438 --> 03:44:41.457
LIAM: I got a 25 for stealth and it didn't work?

03:44:41.457 --> 03:44:43.371
MATT: They're both looking in your direction.

03:44:43.371 --> 03:44:52.601
LIAM: All right. Oh, sorry. Sorry, I heard a noise
in here. I work for the city. I apologize. That

03:44:52.601 --> 03:44:58.824
was really stupid. As you were. I walk out.

03:44:58.824 --> 03:45:00.774
MATT: Make a deception check.

03:45:00.774 --> 03:45:06.635
LIAM: I'll use my last Luck of the day. Didn't do
it; same thing. Nine, 11.

03:45:06.635 --> 03:45:08.035
MATT: 11?

03:45:08.035 --> 03:45:09.276
LIAM: Yeah.

03:45:09.276 --> 03:45:20.497
MATT: Lord Briarwood goes, "Oh, well, that's all
right. Not to worry, in no serious rush. Isn't

03:45:20.497 --> 03:45:22.250
"that right, my dear?"

03:45:22.250 --> 03:45:29.021
And she looks over, she stops taking her jewelry
off and turns. "Yes, yes, of course. As you, a man

03:45:29.021 --> 03:45:30.576
"who works for the city."

03:45:30.576 --> 03:45:32.037
LIAM: Yes ma'am.

03:45:32.037 --> 03:45:34.089
MATT: "What do you do for the city, if I may
ask?"

03:45:34.089 --> 03:45:40.515
LIAM: Oh, I'm a guard. I mean, there's not really
a name for what I do. I work for Uriel, I just--

03:45:40.515 --> 03:45:46.973
I'm security, ma'am, and I thought I heard a noise
in here. And I heard a body fall, I thought--

03:45:46.973 --> 03:45:48.357
sounded like a body fell.

03:45:48.357 --> 03:45:51.300
MATT: They both step a little bit closer. Looking
at you--

03:45:51.300 --> 03:45:55.886
LIAM: I'm backing up as I'm talking, I'm right at
the door! I didn't shut it behind me, I just

03:45:55.886 --> 03:45:57.091
cracked it open.

03:45:57.091 --> 03:46:07.492
MATT: Right. Lady Briarwood goes, "You look
strangely similar to a gentleman we just had

03:46:07.492 --> 03:46:08.870
"dinner with."

03:46:08.870 --> 03:46:10.683
LIAM: That's crazy!

03:46:10.683 --> 03:46:17.172
MATT: "It's uncanny how similar you look."

03:46:17.172 --> 03:46:18.248
LIAM: Yep.

03:46:18.248 --> 03:46:22.082
MATT: (arcane chanting)

03:46:22.082 --> 03:46:23.893
LIAM: And I run!

03:46:23.893 --> 03:46:28.664
MATT: You get to make a wisdom save, is what you
do.

03:46:28.784 --> 03:46:31.075
SAM: Jenga!

03:46:31.075 --> 03:46:33.484
LIAM: Not good. It's an eight.

03:46:33.484 --> 03:46:39.424
MATT: You turn to move and your muscles
(crunching) tense up, as you're unable to

03:46:39.424 --> 03:46:41.452
physically move.

03:46:41.452 --> 03:46:44.324
LIAM: This is awkward, ma'am, I'm just trying to
do my job.

03:46:44.324 --> 03:46:49.750
MATT: You're halfway through the doorway, stuck in
place, as she keeps walking forward now, giving

03:46:49.750 --> 03:46:55.020
you a curious look. Lord Briarwood comes and
flanks you from the other side. (clicks tongue)

03:46:55.175 --> 03:47:05.545
"You try and flee. I'm merely asking you questions.
Come, let us discuss in more private quarters."

03:47:05.545 --> 03:47:09.214
And you feel the hand of Lord Briarwood slam onto
your other shoulder.

03:47:09.214 --> 03:47:13.067
"Don't worry. You look delicious."

03:47:13.067 --> 03:47:17.338
And he pulls you into the room as she
closes the door behind, and that's where we're

03:47:17.338 --> 03:47:18.942
going to end tonight's session.

03:47:18.942 --> 03:47:23.777
(screaming)

03:47:23.777 --> 03:47:26.907
SAM: Jenga! We had a safe word for a reason!

03:47:26.907 --> 03:47:29.556
LIAM: That's cool.

03:47:29.556 --> 03:47:32.793
TRAVIS: Hashtag Save Vax!

03:47:32.793 --> 03:47:36.074
MARISHA: Dude, I think they're into some weird
shit.

03:47:36.074 --> 03:47:41.329
MATT: That was a very slow tension building
episode that turned very interesting at the end.

03:47:41.329 --> 03:47:42.810
How you doing, Taliesin?!

03:47:42.810 --> 03:47:45.364
TALIESIN: (yells and groans)

03:47:45.364 --> 03:47:48.377
LAURA: They're so evil!

03:47:48.377 --> 03:47:50.573
MARISHA: They're creeping me out, man.

03:47:50.573 --> 03:47:53.157
TALIESIN: You're making it so much worse than I
ever imagined.

03:47:53.157 --> 03:47:58.090
LAURA: They're totally vampires.

03:47:58.090 --> 03:48:00.273
MARISHA: Now we're going to have to rescue Vax.

03:48:00.273 --> 03:48:02.496
TALIESIN: I swear if the Briarwoods are
responsible for a party kill, I'm going to feel

03:48:02.496 --> 03:48:04.065
like such an asshole.

03:48:04.065 --> 03:48:09.335
MATT: (laughs) That'd be rough. Well, cool. We'll
all be picking up that next week on Thursday.

03:48:09.335 --> 03:48:13.208
MARISHA: Oh, please, like you haven't rushed into
a situation before, Orion?

03:48:13.208 --> 03:48:16.721
ORION: No! I never have. I can actually say that.

03:48:16.721 --> 03:48:18.752
LIAM: Like attacking an inanimate door?

03:48:18.752 --> 03:48:23.658
MARISHA: Yeah! Or, or launching a Fireball in the
middle of a wood house?

03:48:23.658 --> 03:48:26.127
TALIESIN: Trying to convince an entire army of
illithid to follow you?

03:48:26.127 --> 03:48:29.948
MARISHA: Yeah! Rushing off to Draconia to buy a
Bag of Holding.

03:48:29.948 --> 03:48:34.787
SAM: Or just today, running off to the, to the
sigil!

03:48:34.787 --> 03:48:39.699

LIAM: I regret nothing.

03:49:09.984 --> 03:49:13.142

interesting really fast.

03:49:13.142 --> 03:49:14.746
