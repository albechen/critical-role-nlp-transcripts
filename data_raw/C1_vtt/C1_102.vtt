00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.827
MATT: Hello everyone! Close. Welcome to tonight's
episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us

00:00:04.896 --> 00:00:10.387
nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play
Dungeons &amp; Dragons, rolling dice and shit. So

00:00:10.387 --> 00:00:14.602
welcome! Always awkward. Anyway, before we get
into the game, we're going to do some quick

00:00:14.602 --> 00:00:18.644
announcements for the evening. First off, we had
our recent 100th episode, and I think we have some

00:00:18.644 --> 00:00:20.818
merch in there. Laura, any updates?

00:00:20.818 --> 00:00:26.027
LAURA: Oh my gosh, all that crazy merch that we
have! We have those posters, you guys, those

00:00:26.027 --> 00:00:30.873
amazing David Mack posters that look so pretty.
The signed versions are going to be in the store

00:00:30.873 --> 00:00:36.026
for one more week, and the non-signed version is
going to be in the store for two more weeks! And

00:00:36.026 --> 00:00:40.260
that's it, and then they're gone forever. So tell
your friends, tell your buddies,

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.073
tell everyone you know.

00:00:42.073 --> 00:00:44.429
TRAVIS: Hide your neighbors, hide your wife.

00:00:44.429 --> 00:00:49.035
LAURA: That's right. And we also have our Scanlan
concert tees and our Slayer's Cake aprons. Our

00:00:49.035 --> 00:00:52.745
hats are out of stock, but everything else should
be in there if you guys want to go check it out.

00:00:52.745 --> 00:00:54.105
MATT: Fantastic.

00:00:54.105 --> 00:00:56.078
LAURA: In the shop at Geekandsundry.com.

00:00:56.078 --> 00:00:56.935
LIAM: Sold.

00:00:56.935 --> 00:00:57.839
MARISHA: Word.

00:00:57.839 --> 00:00:58.971
MATT: Thank you, Laura.

00:00:58.971 --> 00:01:00.202
LAURA: Hey, you're welcome.

00:01:00.202 --> 00:01:07.707
MATT: That's so sweet. All right, that is that.
Let's see, here else. Just a reminder, the

00:01:07.707 --> 00:01:12.141
Tal'Dorei campaign guide pre-orders go on sale
mid-July. You can go to the Green Ronin website

00:01:12.141 --> 00:01:17.254
for info on that, and it will be released
physically bound at Gen Con first, and then it

00:01:17.254 --> 00:01:21.656
will be coming out weeks after that on the
interwebs. Check out Green Ronin's site for all

00:01:21.656 --> 00:01:31.036
that information! And we're excited about Gen Con
insanity, so see you guys there. Let's see.

00:01:31.036 --> 00:01:35.419
Wednesday Club? Mr. Taliesin Jaffe?

00:01:35.419 --> 00:01:40.091
TALIESIN: Yeah, we've got something special
planned, but I don't know if it's official yet,

00:01:40.091 --> 00:01:44.508
but I think that we are going to be celebrating
Pride Month, and we may have a special guest. I

00:01:44.508 --> 00:01:47.011
can't say for sure, but we're going to be
talking.

00:01:47.011 --> 00:01:48.644
SAM: It's Stan Lee.

00:01:48.644 --> 00:01:50.746
TALIESIN: It's Stan Lee. He's coming out on our
show.

00:01:50.746 --> 00:01:52.767
LIAM: You heard it here first.

00:01:52.767 --> 00:02:00.039
TALIESIN: He and his pansexual adventures
throughout comicdom. Excelsior. It's going to be

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:01.885
fun. It'll be a thing.

00:02:01.885 --> 00:02:03.593
MATT: Go watch it, true believers!

00:02:03.593 --> 00:02:04.899
TALIESIN: Possible special guest.

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:07.874
MATT: I love it. Check it out, special guest for
Wednesday Club next week. Awesome.

00:02:07.874 --> 00:02:08.911
Thank you, Taliesin.

00:02:08.911 --> 00:02:10.715
LIAM: Why limit myself to just one?

00:02:10.715 --> 00:02:12.437
SAM: That's Gilbert Gottfried?

00:02:12.437 --> 00:02:23.920
MATT: All right. Also, we have Talks Machina
Tuesdays at seven PM Pacific time here, on Twitch

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.895
and Alpha, to discuss what you'll watch tonight on
this episode.

00:02:26.895 --> 00:02:28.237
TRAVIS: Getting turnt.

00:02:28.237 --> 00:02:35.095
MATT: Yes, that. Thank you, Sam. That's okay. Well
done.

00:02:35.095 --> 00:02:39.617
TALIESIN: It's really pleasing in the hand, isn't
it?

00:02:39.617 --> 00:02:41.700
MARISHA: That's what she said.

00:02:41.744 --> 00:02:47.189
MATT: And I think that's it. Quick announcements
this evening. Nice and quick. I like it. That

00:02:47.189 --> 00:02:50.388
means we get to dive back into the story here,
guys!

00:02:50.388 --> 00:02:54.631
TALIESIN: Should we mention that we had to reprint
some character sheets, or are we not mentioning

00:02:54.631 --> 00:02:56.936
that? I've now said it online.

00:02:56.936 --> 00:03:01.060
MATT: Yeah! A few characters levelled. We have a
few folks at 18 now, so that's fun.

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:06.530
TALIESIN: Old enough to get in trouble for
drinking.

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:09.247
LAURA: Do you want to make a special
announcement?

00:03:09.247 --> 00:03:13.387
ASHLEY: So, special announcement about my hair.
No.

00:03:13.387 --> 00:03:18.383
There's a time jump in Blindspot, so I'm here.

00:03:18.383 --> 00:03:19.726
SAM: Spoiler!

00:03:19.726 --> 00:03:21.052
ASHLEY: Oh, shit.

00:03:21.052 --> 00:03:25.925
MARISHA: Do they just assume your character
doesn't go to the salon and cut your hair? Is that

00:03:25.925 --> 00:03:27.194
not a thing?

00:03:27.194 --> 00:03:29.292
LAURA: But they're so pretty!

00:03:29.292 --> 00:03:31.345
ASHLEY: I love them. So much hair!

00:03:31.345 --> 00:03:36.553
LIAM: Did your character in the time jump go to
the Feywild, or go sailing on the sea?

00:03:36.553 --> 00:03:43.649
MATT: I'm pretty sure she makes her own bakery
cake store. It's going to be great. It's called

00:03:43.649 --> 00:03:49.041
the Slayer's Bake. Anyway, guys, I think that's
it, and that being the case, let's go ahead and

00:03:49.041 --> 00:03:53.651
hop into tonight's episode of Critical Role.

00:03:53.651 --> 00:05:24.127
[dramatic music]

00:05:24.127 --> 00:05:28.132
MATT: Hello everyone, and welcome back. So last we
left off--

00:05:28.132 --> 00:05:32.493
LAURA: Wait, do I put that on my saving throws,
too?

00:05:32.493 --> 00:05:33.691
TRAVIS: Are you serious?

00:05:33.691 --> 00:05:34.714
MATT: Yes.

00:05:34.714 --> 00:05:38.727
LIAM: We need to share it with the world. Laura
just leveled up, and her attack bonus went down.

00:05:38.727 --> 00:05:43.578
LAURA: Because I was doing it wrong this whole
time. Yep.

00:05:43.578 --> 00:05:54.913
MATT: Oh boy. Anyway. Last we left off, Vox
Machina had discovered the existence of a second

00:05:54.913 --> 00:06:00.412
ziggurat-like structure on the continent of
Marquet, and apparently a cult of the Whispered

00:06:00.412 --> 00:06:05.800
One there gathering magical artifacts to toss into
a second darkened black orb, similar to the one

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:14.300
beneath Whitestone, all this time. You ran into
Scanlan once more, and leading you guys to where

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:18.752
this cavern was found in the mountains of
Smouldercrown on the continent of Marquet, you did

00:06:18.752 --> 00:06:24.787
battle with the cultists there, and seemed to
reveal one of the leaders in that group was none

00:06:24.787 --> 00:06:32.611
other than the not-dead Delilah Briarwood. She
fended you off, completed their ritual, and some

00:06:32.611 --> 00:06:38.595
of their surviving cultists fled into the orb
apparently to the other side. You then gathered

00:06:38.595 --> 00:06:44.958
yourselves, gathered some supplies, your
information, and then proceeded to travel through

00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:53.793
the orb in Whitestone into the Shadowfell, the
shadow plane, dark mirror to the Prime Material,

00:06:53.793 --> 00:06:59.564
where you stumbled upon a partially ruined city
that had undergone some sort of ancient siege, and

00:06:59.564 --> 00:07:06.491
much of it still lies in ruins and disrepair,
where you discovered what seemed to be two other

00:07:06.491 --> 00:07:13.198
siphon orbs existing around the outskirts of this
forgotten city, leaving threads of magical energy

00:07:13.198 --> 00:07:21.353
being siphoned and transferred to a singular black
obsidian tower, for whatever purpose the Whispered

00:07:21.353 --> 00:07:26.617
One, the Undying King, has for this energy. You
began to make your way deeper into the city,

00:07:26.617 --> 00:07:31.750
masquerading as some undead. In the process you
killed a few cultists wandering the street, and

00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:36.722
intimidated one-- Or, I should say, you didn't
intimidate. You killed him, and then asked his

00:07:36.722 --> 00:07:41.762
corpse. I guess that's a form of intimidation.
Probably one of the most extreme forms of

00:07:41.762 --> 00:07:51.518
intimidation, really. Discovering that this city
is under the title Thar Amphala. Thar Amphala, you

00:07:51.518 --> 00:07:56.864
don't know too much about it, other than it seems
to be where an ancient battle took place. Much of

00:07:56.864 --> 00:08:03.491
the undead that wanders this realm carries
armaments, weapons, and symbols that seem to be of

00:08:03.491 --> 00:08:12.908
Pelor, the Dawn Father. You also discovered that
there's this tower in the center titled Entropis,

00:08:12.908 --> 00:08:19.744
where all the magic is being funneled at the
moment. Thus, having found this information,

00:08:19.744 --> 00:08:26.093
gathered your resolve, you continue your trek
deeper and deeper into the city surrounding the

00:08:26.093 --> 00:08:31.413
tower Entropis, to discover what your purpose is
here in Thar Amphala.

00:08:31.413 --> 00:08:36.295
So, Vox Machina, what do you do?

00:08:36.295 --> 00:08:40.452
LIAM: Figuring it all out.

00:08:40.452 --> 00:08:43.114
SAM: Taking five.

00:08:43.114 --> 00:08:45.522
LAURA: Time out, time out, time out.

00:08:45.522 --> 00:08:47.157
ASHLEY: Just hanging out.

00:08:47.157 --> 00:08:49.583
SAM: So we found out that there's a ritual
happening soon.

00:08:49.583 --> 00:08:51.090
LAURA: Yeah, like super stat.

00:08:51.090 --> 00:08:54.198
SAM: And there's no day or night here, so who
cares, right?

00:08:54.198 --> 00:08:56.989
LAURA: Right? It's all just night, all the time.

00:08:56.989 --> 00:09:04.092
MATT: It's kind of a sunless gray sky. There's
some low light, like a very heavy-- Like a very

00:09:04.092 --> 00:09:06.540
dark, thunderous Seattle.

00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:11.705
ASHLEY: (singing) Hello Seattle! It's a song.

00:09:11.705 --> 00:09:15.775
TRAVIS: What song?

00:09:15.775 --> 00:09:17.102
ASHLEY: I think it is.

00:09:17.102 --> 00:09:19.250
MATT: It is now. So.

00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:26.748
SAM: We have to make our way to the big tower,
right? Super fast, and invisibly.

00:09:26.748 --> 00:09:29.403
Oh, we're also vampire creatures!

00:09:29.403 --> 00:09:32.597
LAURA: Oh, we look like the gloom stalkers! No,
those are the flying ones.

00:09:32.597 --> 00:09:36.470
SAM: We look like miscellaneous vampirey things,
right?

00:09:36.470 --> 00:09:38.618
LIAM: Yeah, shambling zombies.

00:09:38.618 --> 00:09:39.983
LAURA: Scary ghouly creatures.

00:09:39.983 --> 00:09:43.144
TALIESIN: Extras from a bad zombie video.

00:09:43.144 --> 00:09:45.157
TRAVIS: Is Pass Without a Trace still kicking?

00:09:45.157 --> 00:09:46.929
SAM: What?

00:09:46.929 --> 00:09:49.017
TRAVIS: Pass Without a Trace.

00:09:49.017 --> 00:09:52.027
MATT: I would say probably because you haven't
cast a spell yet that

00:09:52.027 --> 00:09:54.174
would've interrupted it, it would be...

00:09:54.174 --> 00:09:55.982
LAURA: I cast it when we landed here.

00:09:55.982 --> 00:10:00.470
MATT: But I don't think you've done anything that
altered that concentration yet.

00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:02.732
LAURA: I don't think so. So it's still going?

00:10:02.732 --> 00:10:06.068
MATT: I think so. For maybe another 30 minutes or
so.

00:10:06.068 --> 00:10:08.144
LAURA: Yeah, I didn't Hunter's Mark either of the
guys that I attacked.

00:10:08.217 --> 00:10:11.612
TRAVIS: And we've got the smoking thing, right?
What's it called, the censer?

00:10:11.612 --> 00:10:12.995
LAURA: Yeah, that thing.

00:10:12.995 --> 00:10:14.266
TRAVIS: What is it?

00:10:14.266 --> 00:10:15.389
LAURA: The smoky thing.

00:10:15.389 --> 00:10:16.867
SAM: The censer.

00:10:16.867 --> 00:10:18.187
TRAVIS: Is it called a censer?

00:10:18.187 --> 00:10:19.027
MATT: Yes.

00:10:19.027 --> 00:10:20.629
TRAVIS: First try!

00:10:20.629 --> 00:10:22.635
LIAM: And we learned that it does something, too.

00:10:22.635 --> 00:10:24.264
SAM: It protects you from ghouley deads.

00:10:24.264 --> 00:10:26.050
LIAM: From ghouley deads, specifically.

00:10:26.050 --> 00:10:27.616
ASHLEY: Will it protect all of us?

00:10:27.616 --> 00:10:29.276
TALIESIN: I think it's got a range.

00:10:29.276 --> 00:10:31.399
LAURA: If we stay in this... tight.

00:10:31.399 --> 00:10:32.594
ASHLEY: If we stay tight?

00:10:32.594 --> 00:10:33.565
TALIESIN: Stay tight.

00:10:33.565 --> 00:10:38.456
SAM: So why don't we just walk through the center
of town, in the middle of the road, with the

00:10:38.456 --> 00:10:41.391
censer, and walk into the tower? No? Maybe?

00:10:41.391 --> 00:10:45.166
LAURA: No. I see nothing wrong with this plan.

00:10:45.166 --> 00:10:47.252
SAM: Fly up to the top of the tower?

00:10:47.252 --> 00:10:48.692
TRAVIS: Oh, no.

00:10:48.692 --> 00:10:51.105
TALIESIN: Stay on the ground.

00:10:51.105 --> 00:10:52.576
SAM: Teleport somewhere?

00:10:52.576 --> 00:10:54.171
LAURA: Do you have that ability?

00:10:54.171 --> 00:10:55.637
SAM: She does.

00:10:55.637 --> 00:10:57.900
LAURA: There's no trees on the top of the tower.

00:10:57.900 --> 00:10:59.824
SAM: Or we can be smoky mist.

00:10:59.824 --> 00:11:07.111
LAURA: Then it'll take us a minute to not be mist
anymore, and by then they'll realize we're there

00:11:07.111 --> 00:11:08.542
on the top of the tower.

00:11:08.542 --> 00:11:12.466
TRAVIS: Should we take off the robes that they had
and pop it on some of us?

00:11:12.466 --> 00:11:16.427
LAURA: Sure, why not? I mean, we're undead. We
look like we're undead.

00:11:16.427 --> 00:11:21.510
TALIESIN: I think they probably know we're here. I
think they probably know we're coming. I think

00:11:21.510 --> 00:11:27.434
let's just trepidatiously make our way a little
closer, see what else is in this town, see if

00:11:27.434 --> 00:11:29.395
maybe there's anything useful.

00:11:29.395 --> 00:11:32.186
LIAM: And stay low-key. We don't need to go
marching.

00:11:32.186 --> 00:11:33.746
LAURA: Blend in.

00:11:33.746 --> 00:11:35.655
TALIESIN: Let's not blow anything up yet.

00:11:35.655 --> 00:11:37.639
SAM: But we're making our way to the tower.

00:11:37.639 --> 00:11:40.521
TALIESIN: Making our way towards the tower, in a
towerly direction.

00:11:40.521 --> 00:11:41.947
LAURA: Are we at full health?

00:11:41.947 --> 00:11:44.358
TALIESIN: No. I'm not.

00:11:44.358 --> 00:11:45.680
LAURA: I'm not either.

00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:48.546
ASHLEY: I can help with that.

00:11:48.546 --> 00:11:51.778
LAURA: Should we take a 30-minute rest and roll
some hit points?

00:11:51.778 --> 00:11:56.871
MARISHA: Did we fight? Oh, no, that's right, we
went down going through.

00:11:56.871 --> 00:12:01.781
MATT: Yeah, going through the actual portal, the
spinning ball of death caused some damage.

00:12:01.781 --> 00:12:04.518
LAURA: I don't know if there's actually time for
that, though, to take.

00:12:04.518 --> 00:12:09.157
TALIESIN: I'm all right with mine. I'm 20 points
down. I don't mind being 20 points down.

00:12:09.157 --> 00:12:11.534
SAM: Let's be all full, though. We can be full.

00:12:11.534 --> 00:12:13.789
LAURA: We're going to fucking potentially fight
Delilah Briarwood.

00:12:13.789 --> 00:12:15.053
SAM: Yeah, let's be full.

00:12:15.053 --> 00:12:17.762
MARISHA: I'm assuming it's going to take us some
time just to even get there, though, right?

00:12:17.762 --> 00:12:21.581
LAURA: Is it considered healing as we walk there,
though?

00:12:21.581 --> 00:12:23.733
MATT: No, you have to take a rest.

00:12:23.733 --> 00:12:29.437
TALIESIN: Let's get a little closer, then, and
survey the situation, and then take a break. I

00:12:29.437 --> 00:12:30.912
feel like we're a bit far.

00:12:30.912 --> 00:12:33.975
LAURA: I just don't know if there's time. If she's
already started a ritual.

00:12:33.975 --> 00:12:36.591
TALIESIN: If we run into something on the way
there, though, I don't want to be at peak

00:12:36.591 --> 00:12:37.842
performance yet.

00:12:37.842 --> 00:12:39.276
LAURA: Yeah. All right.

00:12:39.276 --> 00:12:41.304
TRAVIS: Let's move.

00:12:41.304 --> 00:12:42.811
SAM: Oh, God.

00:12:42.811 --> 00:12:43.761
MARISHA: Sure.

00:12:43.761 --> 00:12:44.912
TALIESIN: This is going to be fun.

00:12:44.912 --> 00:12:46.269
MARISHA: Do we still have Pass Without a Trace?

00:12:46.269 --> 00:12:47.635
MATT: You do. For the next 30 minutes or so.

00:12:47.635 --> 00:12:49.549
TALIESIN: So let's take advantage of this.

00:12:49.549 --> 00:12:51.393
MARISHA: Yeah, let's at least move for 30 more
minutes.

00:12:51.393 --> 00:12:56.615
TRAVIS: Who's got the censer in the front? Because
we've got to stay together.

00:12:56.615 --> 00:12:57.941
SAM: Someone in a robe.

00:12:57.941 --> 00:12:59.685
LAURA: Oh. Who's in a robe? We're all undead.

00:12:59.685 --> 00:13:01.496
MARISHA: Are me and you in robes?

00:13:01.496 --> 00:13:03.984
TALIESIN: We can do robes. I'm all right with
robes.

00:13:03.984 --> 00:13:05.427
TRAVIS: There's only three of them.

00:13:05.427 --> 00:13:06.751
TALIESIN: I'll take a robe.

00:13:06.751 --> 00:13:07.839
LAURA: I'll take a robe.

00:13:07.839 --> 00:13:08.988
MARISHA: You lead with the censer.

00:13:08.988 --> 00:13:10.068
TALIESIN: I'll take a robe with the censer.

00:13:10.068 --> 00:13:11.096
MATT: Okay, Percy and Vex?

00:13:11.096 --> 00:13:11.957
LAURA: Yeah.

00:13:11.957 --> 00:13:16.492
MATT: Okay. You both throw robes on over your
Seeming-altered undead bodies. Percy, you're

00:13:16.492 --> 00:13:17.309
carrying the censer?

00:13:17.309 --> 00:13:18.504
TALIESIN: Yes, I'm carrying the censer.

00:13:18.504 --> 00:13:19.696
MATT: And you're all slowly clustered behind
them?

00:13:19.696 --> 00:13:20.636
TALIESIN: Yes.

00:13:20.636 --> 00:13:21.589
MATT: Okay.

00:13:21.589 --> 00:13:24.334
MARISHA: (chanting)

00:13:24.334 --> 00:13:25.754
TRAVIS: (chanting)

00:13:25.754 --> 00:13:26.923
TALIESIN: Thank you.

00:13:26.923 --> 00:13:31.808
MATT: All right. So you guys continue moving,
what's very plainly towards the center of the city

00:13:31.808 --> 00:13:38.946
as the tower stands as this giant beacon of shadow
in the center of the horizon. The streets are

00:13:38.946 --> 00:13:44.786
scattered and broken. You can see there was, what
may have seemed almost like a hint of cobblestone

00:13:44.786 --> 00:13:50.635
at one point, really just looks like largely
broken and shattered badlands and dried stone that

00:13:50.635 --> 00:13:57.811
seems to have been pummeled by impacts of some
kind, cracked into small pieces. This is a city by

00:13:57.811 --> 00:14:01.520
function and function alone. There was very little
considered in the beauty of its construction, at

00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:06.334
least this far out. As you continue to press
towards the center of the city--

00:14:06.334 --> 00:14:13.178
LAURA: I want to keep an eye out, just to see if
anybody's noticing. If it seems like people are

00:14:13.178 --> 00:14:15.587
paying attention to us in a way that they
shouldn't be.

00:14:15.587 --> 00:14:19.242
MATT: Okay. Well, as you're keeping an eye out, I
would like all of you guys to make a deception

00:14:19.242 --> 00:14:21.433
roll, with advantage.

00:14:21.433 --> 00:14:24.079
MARISHA: With advantage?

00:14:24.079 --> 00:14:25.384
MATT: Yes.

00:14:25.384 --> 00:14:32.918
TRAVIS: Come on, Gil.

00:14:32.918 --> 00:14:37.557
TALIESIN: That's not bad.

00:14:37.557 --> 00:14:39.139
SAM: 33.

00:14:39.139 --> 00:14:40.922
TALIESIN: 21.

00:14:40.922 --> 00:14:41.992
MARISHA: 17.

00:14:41.992 --> 00:14:43.003
LIAM: 18.

00:14:43.003 --> 00:14:44.009
LAURA: 17.

00:14:44.009 --> 00:14:45.171
MATT: Pike?

00:14:45.171 --> 00:14:46.456
ASHLEY: 22.

00:14:46.456 --> 00:14:47.844
TRAVIS: Eight.

00:14:47.844 --> 00:14:50.077
LIAM: Too big.

00:14:50.077 --> 00:14:52.292
TRAVIS: I'm sorry.

00:14:52.292 --> 00:15:00.154
MATT: As you guys make your way further down one
of the, not major thoroughfares, but one of the

00:15:00.154 --> 00:15:06.099
general streets that snakes around towards the
central area of the city, some of you gently

00:15:06.099 --> 00:15:13.004
moaning and gurgling as you walk, behind you, you have
Grog Frankensteining his way down the street.

00:15:13.004 --> 00:15:25.471
(laughing)

00:15:25.471 --> 00:15:27.188
TRAVIS: Oh man.

00:15:27.188 --> 00:15:34.168
MATT: The sound of your rendition, that song. As
you're walking, a shadow seems to cross, a large

00:15:34.168 --> 00:15:40.662
hulking shadow crosses past one of the roads and
turns and begins walking your direction. And you

00:15:40.662 --> 00:15:47.858
see ahead what looks to be about a ten foot tall,
thick, burly figure of brownish red flesh, torn,

00:15:47.858 --> 00:15:57.779
and chains and hooks hanging from it. It looks to
be almost like an amalgam of large hobgoblin body

00:15:57.779 --> 00:16:02.531
parts that have been sewn and stitched together
with spikes and iron plates, jutting through,

00:16:02.531 --> 00:16:07.191
keeping it together at the seams. Where there
would be a face, you see instead a giant metal

00:16:07.191 --> 00:16:12.100
mass that looks like a cage of some kind, and
behind it these two glowing beads of yellow eyes

00:16:12.100 --> 00:16:17.282
poking through, and you watch as it just walks in
a straight line (impacts).

00:16:17.282 --> 00:16:18.694
LAURA: Coming right for us?

00:16:18.694 --> 00:16:21.658
MATT: Walking in your direction. Its arms are
curled in front of it like a gorilla, its fingers

00:16:21.658 --> 00:16:23.568
dragging in the dust below it.

00:16:23.568 --> 00:16:27.115
LIAM: Does it look like it's just happening in our
direction, or is it coming toward us?

00:16:27.115 --> 00:16:29.600
MATT: It's hard to tell. It's about 60 feet up.

00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:31.862
LAURA: Is there a road we can turn directions?

00:16:31.862 --> 00:16:36.209
TALIESIN: Is there a nonchalant way of maintaining
direction but getting out of its way?

00:16:36.209 --> 00:16:41.663
MATT: There would be enough space to give about a
ten foot berth to it as you put your back against

00:16:41.663 --> 00:16:43.975
the side of one of the nearest buildings and let
it pass.

00:16:43.975 --> 00:16:46.246
MARISHA: Like parting for the queen at the Ren
Faire?

00:16:46.246 --> 00:16:47.445
MATT: A little bit, yeah.

00:16:47.445 --> 00:16:49.433
LIAM: Or Taliesin Jaffe.

00:16:49.433 --> 00:16:52.550
MARISHA: Or Taliesin Jaffe at any party.

00:16:52.550 --> 00:16:54.851
ASHLEY: I move to the side and put my head down.

00:16:54.851 --> 00:16:57.103
SAM: What's our ploy if this thing tries to kill
us?

00:16:57.103 --> 00:16:58.117
LAURA: Kill it.

00:16:58.117 --> 00:16:59.315
SAM: Okay.

00:16:59.315 --> 00:17:00.676
TRAVIS: Same old same old.

00:17:00.676 --> 00:17:11.098
MATT: (heavy footsteps) You guys all make your way
to the side and you watch. It's autonomous, it's

00:17:11.098 --> 00:17:18.470
not being brought along with anybody. It's running
a path down the road. You all move off to the

00:17:18.470 --> 00:17:26.824
side, and as you maneuver to the side of it, it
gets close to the censer you're carrying, and it

00:17:26.824 --> 00:17:33.403
(groaning) puts its fingers out of the way,
actually crushing some of the stonework on one of

00:17:33.403 --> 00:17:38.674
the nearby buildings to pull itself aside, trying
to avoid the billowing of the smoke from the

00:17:38.674 --> 00:17:49.212
censer. It gives a dull, deep resonant (huff) in
your direction as it passes, and then eventually

00:17:49.212 --> 00:17:54.747
passes by the cluster of you that have all moved
to the side, after its head shifts and scans back

00:17:54.747 --> 00:17:59.015
in the path that it's walking and it moves past
you, following the direction you just came from.

00:17:59.015 --> 00:18:02.114
TALIESIN: Way to be Fonzies.

00:18:02.114 --> 00:18:04.681
LAURA: Nice. Very nice. So cool.

00:18:04.681 --> 00:18:06.970
SAM: Wow. This thing works.

00:18:06.970 --> 00:18:08.721
TALIESIN: Lot of Fonzies. Smells terrible.

00:18:08.721 --> 00:18:18.635
MATT: You continue further into the city. You
still hear the distant, low shrieks of the gloom

00:18:18.635 --> 00:18:28.361
stalkers (shriek) overhead, swooping past in
clusters, circling around. Occasionally you watch

00:18:28.361 --> 00:18:34.214
one or two swoop down and land on a distant
rooftop, and you hear the crunching of heavy stone

00:18:34.214 --> 00:18:40.905
and whatever materials were still remaining on the
roof of that structure as it lands and surveys a

00:18:40.905 --> 00:18:45.178
bit, and then (whoosh) takes off and joins the
rest of its kin.

00:18:45.178 --> 00:18:52.057
TALIESIN: Do any of the buildings look remarkable
or interesting? I'm trying to keep an eye out for

00:18:52.057 --> 00:18:58.691
any building that may have anything inside it of
vague importance. Either the building itself is

00:18:58.691 --> 00:19:04.069
slightly more interesting, or it looks like maybe
someone has boarded something up to try and

00:19:04.069 --> 00:19:11.294
maintain some kind of vigil against the darkness?
I'm not entirely sure. Out of the ordinary.

00:19:11.294 --> 00:19:13.291
MATT: Okay. Make an investigation check.

00:19:13.291 --> 00:19:23.463
TALIESIN: I knew you were going to say that. I'm
not good at this. Nope. Nope, nope. That's a four.

00:19:23.463 --> 00:19:25.413
That's a natural one.

00:19:25.413 --> 00:19:31.978
MATT: A lot of these buildings are hard to tell
apart when they're all just in this state of

00:19:31.978 --> 00:19:33.295
disrepair and destruction.

00:19:33.295 --> 00:19:34.926
TALIESIN: Some of them have doors.

00:19:34.926 --> 00:19:37.344
MATT: Some of them do. Some of them have windows,
kind of.

00:19:37.344 --> 00:19:39.511
TALIESIN: Holes where windows might be.

00:19:39.511 --> 00:19:45.823
MATT: Possibly. Some, you can't tell if it's a
hole, or a window. Or a door?

00:19:45.823 --> 00:19:47.915
As you press forward.

00:19:47.915 --> 00:19:49.993
TALIESIN: I felt Orthax take over again.

00:19:49.993 --> 00:19:55.980
LIAM: So this is Osgiliath, right? It's wrecked
ruin, no complete buildings, or are any of them?

00:19:55.980 --> 00:20:00.104
MATT: You see some further in. The exterior
appears to have been the most heavily sacked.

00:20:00.104 --> 00:20:08.652
There's been little intent to reconstruct from
this point. Like I said, you're still probably a

00:20:08.652 --> 00:20:16.300
good mile and a half out from the center of the
city, and as you walk further in, you can see more

00:20:16.300 --> 00:20:22.729
clusters of skeletons traveling in groups of 12 to
15, somewhat erratically. You've seen some

00:20:22.729 --> 00:20:27.635
creatures that seem to walk with an intent
pattern, like they have some sort of a sentinel

00:20:27.635 --> 00:20:32.793
path that they follow to keep watch on the
perimeter or the roads of the city. The skeletons

00:20:32.793 --> 00:20:39.009
that wander, the undead that you see clattering
about across the dusty, cracked grounds between

00:20:39.009 --> 00:20:47.168
the buildings, are erratic, uncontrolled. Mostly
it seems to be less intentionally created undead,

00:20:47.168 --> 00:20:53.907
and more just risen by the nature of the plane you
walk, and haven't bothered anyone yet, or at least

00:20:53.907 --> 00:21:01.366
those who live here. As you begin walking forward,
you watch as a cluster of them spills into this T

00:21:01.366 --> 00:21:04.872
intersection a little ways up, a few of them
falling and tumbling and getting back up

00:21:04.872 --> 00:21:10.184
(cracking). As they cluster together, some of them
bang into each other. You hear the clattering of

00:21:10.184 --> 00:21:15.748
metal from the bits of armor that still cling to
their long-rotted forms. Broken bones, some of

00:21:15.748 --> 00:21:20.667
them are missing arms, or sections of a skull is
exposed and cracked open on the side, where you

00:21:20.667 --> 00:21:25.937
can see what looks to be some sort of long-dried
and rotted away gray matter was left to slowly

00:21:25.937 --> 00:21:36.583
collapse like a flan in a cupboard. As you begin
to approach that area, they separate a bit and

00:21:36.583 --> 00:21:41.957
scatter to fill, almost diffusing in the center of
this intersection, and then they contract, almost

00:21:41.957 --> 00:21:46.641
like there's a strange hive mind magic that seems
to draw them back together. They're just moving in

00:21:46.641 --> 00:21:53.303
these autonomous clusters of chaos. You see on
them still, similar to the ones you noticed

00:21:53.303 --> 00:21:57.721
earlier, some of the armor that they're wearing
appears to be reminiscent to the armor that the

00:21:57.721 --> 00:22:04.101
black guard that you battled at the ziggurat
earlier had, or similar dark metal, and others

00:22:04.101 --> 00:22:12.502
have long-destroyed, ruined, scraped and scarred
bits of silver and gold armor that are emblazoned

00:22:12.502 --> 00:22:17.663
with long-ruined and defaced symbols of the Dawn
Father, Pelor.

00:22:17.663 --> 00:22:21.157
LAURA: Does it seem like both of those factions
are still--

00:22:21.157 --> 00:22:22.980
are they clustered in the same groups?

00:22:23.298 --> 00:22:29.695
MATT: They are. And you get the sense that
whatever battle took place here long ago was

00:22:29.695 --> 00:22:35.667
probably between these two factions, and those
that were lost in that fray have been risen over

00:22:35.667 --> 00:22:38.394
time and wander aimlessly through the streets.

00:22:38.394 --> 00:22:40.192
TALIESIN: Free range undead.

00:22:40.192 --> 00:22:47.866
LIAM: We've seen long-dead people. This is fucking
creepy in the upside-down.

00:22:47.866 --> 00:22:49.750
(airplane noise)
SAM: What's going on?

00:22:49.750 --> 00:22:56.355
MATT: I called the airport to try and coordinate
this time with you guys. Cost me 17,000 dollars

00:22:56.355 --> 00:23:00.435
for that one five-second bit, so enjoy it, guys.

00:23:00.435 --> 00:23:02.004
LIAM: Worth it.

00:23:02.004 --> 00:23:03.521
MATT: Totally worth it.

00:23:03.521 --> 00:23:09.711
LIAM: These bodies, compared to the ex-champion of
the Raven Queen, do these bodies seem even older?

00:23:09.711 --> 00:23:14.092
More decayed? Do we have any sense for how old
these fuckers are?

00:23:14.092 --> 00:23:17.470
MATT: You would have to get up close and that
would be a medicine check. Would you want to try

00:23:17.470 --> 00:23:22.468
and make your way close enough to one of these
bodies to inspect it enough?

00:23:22.468 --> 00:23:24.044
LIAM: How far off are they?

00:23:24.044 --> 00:23:27.944
MATT: If you guys continue moving forward, you'll
be at that intersection in about 30 seconds.

00:23:27.944 --> 00:23:29.742
LIAM: I'm not going to go. I'll wait.

00:23:29.742 --> 00:23:32.654
ASHLEY: I could go up close with somebody and do a
medicine check.

00:23:32.654 --> 00:23:36.866
LAURA: Keep up near the thing. Everybody get close
to the censer.

00:23:36.866 --> 00:23:39.265
TALIESIN: I'll guide us towards something.

00:23:39.265 --> 00:23:42.852
LIAM: Yeah, no one poking out ahead for this.

00:23:42.852 --> 00:23:44.423
LAURA: Hopefully they'll be affected by the
censer.

00:23:44.423 --> 00:23:45.922
TRAVIS: Let's just stop by.

00:23:45.922 --> 00:23:50.279
MATT: So who's moving forward?

00:23:50.279 --> 00:23:54.914
LAURA: The whole group. So we can all be with the
wispy smoke.

00:23:54.914 --> 00:23:59.570
MATT: Okay. So you guys make your way towards this
intersection.

00:23:59.570 --> 00:24:02.374
LAURA: We're normal people in robes.

00:24:02.374 --> 00:24:10.611
MATT: You also watch as you begin to walk further
in that elements of the ground are growing more

00:24:10.611 --> 00:24:17.088
jagged and craggy. You can see bits of stone and
earth are jutting out in large stone spikes,

00:24:17.088 --> 00:24:24.500
either through some upheaval or elements of the
tumultuous landscape long ago that just caused

00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:33.502
elements of rock to spike outward up five, ten
feet in sections. You watch as you grow close to

00:24:33.502 --> 00:24:41.977
this intersection, about half of the group all at
once (groan) turns and looks in your direction and

00:24:41.977 --> 00:24:45.178
begin to (footsteps).

00:24:45.178 --> 00:24:47.373
LAURA: Can I just waft some of the smoke towards
them?

00:24:47.373 --> 00:24:51.693
MATT: Shamble in your direction. The rest of the
group noticing-- You begin blowing the censer

00:24:51.693 --> 00:25:03.786
smoke that way. You watch as three of the closest
skeletons make their way into the fume and seem to

00:25:03.786 --> 00:25:06.546
vaguely lose interest for a brief moment.

00:25:06.546 --> 00:25:10.010
ASHLEY: Since we're close, can I do a medicine
check? Are we close enough to?

00:25:10.010 --> 00:25:12.734
MATT: Yes, but with disadvantage because of the
smoke.

00:25:12.734 --> 00:25:15.171
ASHLEY: Oh, shit. Okay.

00:25:15.171 --> 00:25:16.909
LAURA: You got this, Pike.

00:25:16.909 --> 00:25:20.589
TALIESIN: Roll like it's a stealth roll.

00:25:20.589 --> 00:25:28.524
ASHLEY: 13?

00:25:28.603 --> 00:25:34.890
MATT: With the brief glances you have, it's hard
to really tell. Plus, you're not too familiar with

00:25:34.890 --> 00:25:43.271
the overall weather of the Shadowfell. You don't
know if there's enough weather to manifest as

00:25:43.271 --> 00:25:52.029
general decay, or if they've been beaten by the
ravages of time, if it rains here or not. It's

00:25:52.029 --> 00:25:56.187
hard to tell. You gather it probably doesn't rain
often. They're definitely hundreds of years old.

00:25:56.187 --> 00:26:00.068
That's the most you can really tell. They aren't
fresh dead. These are long dead.

00:26:00.068 --> 00:26:03.587
LIAM: I'm feeling Foresighty. Can I creep up
behind and do the same?

00:26:03.587 --> 00:26:12.454
MATT: I will say you can do that, however you
still have disadvantage, because she's already

00:26:12.454 --> 00:26:16.797
taken the roll and you're supplementing her roll
in a very short period of time.

00:26:16.797 --> 00:26:19.633
LIAM: Would that be an even roll, then, since I
have advantage on everything?

00:26:19.633 --> 00:26:23.051
MATT: You have advantage on everything. I'm giving
you a chance to do this when normally you would

00:26:23.051 --> 00:26:27.004
have none, so the Foresight's allowing you to have
a roll with disadvantage. Go for it.

00:26:27.004 --> 00:26:31.012
LIAM: Oh, that's going to fail. Ooh! 18.

00:26:31.012 --> 00:26:43.084
MATT: Or not. Getting a glance at the one nearest
to you, the bodies seem to be fairly well

00:26:43.084 --> 00:26:46.631
preserved for as long as they've been here, so you
get the sense that there isn't a lot of heavy

00:26:46.631 --> 00:26:52.228
weather here at all. And given that fact, the
decay that's there, it is reminiscent, maybe not

00:26:52.228 --> 00:26:59.255
quite as old as the corpse of Purvon when you
discovered the tomb originally, but comparatively

00:26:59.255 --> 00:27:02.187
ancient. At least over 500 years.

00:27:02.187 --> 00:27:07.570
TRAVIS: Old Purvon.

00:27:07.570 --> 00:27:09.724
MATT: Good old Purvon.

00:27:09.724 --> 00:27:12.343
LAURA: These skeletons are almost as old as you,
Scanlan.

00:27:12.343 --> 00:27:15.066
SAM: Good one.

00:27:15.066 --> 00:27:27.107
MATT: As you continue to walk forward, and the
skeletons part around the cloud of the censer, you

00:27:27.107 --> 00:27:34.424
push deeper into the city, and they coalesce
behind you and follow. They're keeping a perimeter

00:27:34.424 --> 00:27:42.050
cluster now. They're still being held at bay by
the wafting of this thick blackish-green smoke

00:27:42.050 --> 00:27:47.173
that's billowing off of it, but they're staying
just outside of it and slowly shambling at your

00:27:47.173 --> 00:27:49.078
speed, waiting for an opening.

00:27:49.078 --> 00:27:54.973
LAURA: I have an idea. What if, right when we get
close to the tower, all of these trailing

00:27:54.973 --> 00:28:00.107
skeletons that we have on us, you just Turn
Undead? And then you control them all?

00:28:00.107 --> 00:28:03.399
SAM: You can do that?

00:28:03.399 --> 00:28:05.798
MATT: Destroy them, yeah.

00:28:05.798 --> 00:28:08.123
LAURA: Oh, you can't control them? I thought you
could.

00:28:08.123 --> 00:28:09.474
ASHLEY: I could turn them.

00:28:09.474 --> 00:28:11.122
MATT: Turn them means they just run away
screaming.

00:28:11.122 --> 00:28:12.578
ASHLEY: I can make them run away.

00:28:12.578 --> 00:28:18.134
MATT: You're at a level where you can just make
them explode if they roll low. Up to you.

00:28:18.134 --> 00:28:20.573
TRAVIS: We've got a little nuke in our pocket.

00:28:20.573 --> 00:28:25.731
ASHLEY: I want us to be quiet. I don't want to
make a big spectacle. Because I can make them go

00:28:25.731 --> 00:28:28.101
boom boom, but let's just wait.

00:28:28.101 --> 00:28:29.770
LAURA: She can make them poop.

00:28:29.770 --> 00:28:35.205
TALIESIN: And they don't even have bowels.

00:28:35.205 --> 00:28:40.020
TRAVIS: Is anything stalking us from above while
we're moving?

00:28:40.020 --> 00:28:42.128
MATT: How astute of you, I was just about to get
to that.

00:28:42.128 --> 00:28:45.227
TRAVIS: Did you hear that? Astute.

00:28:45.227 --> 00:28:47.640
SAM: You put the ass in astute.

00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:50.748
LAURA: Hey, did you guys know that Travis is the
smartest guy at the table?

00:28:50.748 --> 00:28:54.411
MARISHA: I could tell by his Cheers shirt.

00:28:54.411 --> 00:29:04.655
(laughing)

00:29:04.655 --> 00:29:11.903
MATT: So. In the billowing smoke that's coming
around, Grog, because you brought it up, as well

00:29:11.903 --> 00:29:16.699
as the twins who have relatively high passive
perceptions, and Keyleth as well, actually, you

00:29:16.699 --> 00:29:22.136
glance up and notice that the erratic patterns
that a lot of the gloom stalkers take in the sky,

00:29:22.136 --> 00:29:28.442
there's two that seem to be circling, and
circling.

00:29:28.442 --> 00:29:30.473
ASHLEY: I don't like it, I don't like it.

00:29:30.473 --> 00:29:37.195
MATT: One of them (shrieks), and you watch as it
goes into a dive in your direction.

00:29:37.195 --> 00:29:38.999
SAM: Oh, God! In our direction?

00:29:38.999 --> 00:29:40.915
LAURA: Is there a building we can duck into?

00:29:40.915 --> 00:29:42.714
MATT: Make a quick perception check.

00:29:42.714 --> 00:29:44.318
SAM: But quick!

00:29:44.318 --> 00:29:52.160
LAURA: 33.

00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:53.418
LIAM: 24.

00:29:53.418 --> 00:29:58.532
MATT: Okay. Both of you, really quick, you see in
two different directions, past the intersection on

00:29:58.532 --> 00:30:02.044
the right, and on the left, you see two buildings
that are mostly still intact. They've sustained

00:30:02.044 --> 00:30:06.240
some level of damage, but they still have two
solid floors, maybe a partial roof missing, but

00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:10.243
they appear to be structurally sound enough to at
least jump into. They both have doors that are

00:30:10.243 --> 00:30:12.279
partially ajar and a darkened interior.

00:30:12.279 --> 00:30:13.250
LAURA: And a roof.

00:30:13.250 --> 00:30:14.154
MATT: And a roof.

00:30:14.154 --> 00:30:15.389
LIAM: (grunting)

00:30:15.389 --> 00:30:18.540
LAURA: (grunting) Why am I? I can talk. Go in that
building.

00:30:18.540 --> 00:30:20.556
TRAVIS: Yeah, we go in there.

00:30:20.556 --> 00:30:23.440
LAURA: That way they can't dive bomb us, at
least.

00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:25.915
TALIESIN: I go in last. Censer.

00:30:25.915 --> 00:30:30.004
MATT: All right. So you guys all rush into the
building on the right or the left?

00:30:30.004 --> 00:30:33.290
TALIESIN: Yours.

00:30:33.290 --> 00:30:34.493
LAURA: The right.

00:30:34.493 --> 00:30:38.328
MATT: All right, so the one that Vex found. You
guys all rush into that building with Percival the

00:30:38.328 --> 00:30:40.043
last one in there. As you--

00:30:40.043 --> 00:30:41.805
LAURA: Weapons drawn in case there's something in
there.

00:30:41.805 --> 00:30:43.338
SAM: But also moving like zombies.

00:30:43.338 --> 00:30:53.970
MATT: Okay. Perfect. So as you guys all rush into
the building, weapons ready,

00:30:53.970 --> 00:30:56.302
who's first in the building?

00:30:56.302 --> 00:30:59.011
LAURA: Me, maybe, because we saw it.

00:30:59.011 --> 00:31:03.218
MATT: The two of you guys. Both of you roll
perception as you enter the interior of the

00:31:03.288 --> 00:31:09.088
building. The undead that are clustering behind
you are beginning to gather in a semicircle as

00:31:09.088 --> 00:31:12.066
soon as you hit the inside of the building, and
they're clustering

00:31:12.066 --> 00:31:14.080
at the door as you close it behind you.

00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:14.963
LAURA: 20.

00:31:14.963 --> 00:31:16.009
LIAM: 24.

00:31:16.009 --> 00:31:19.971
MATT: Okay. As you enter the inside, you look
around and you can see what appears to be the

00:31:19.971 --> 00:31:25.122
remnants of a few tables, very simple tables, that
have been shattered and destroyed, broken into

00:31:25.122 --> 00:31:29.892
ruin around the area. You see what appear to be
blades, two left in the wall, one broken off, in

00:31:29.892 --> 00:31:38.801
the center, that have long rusted over time. You
see what appear to be the signs of bodies, blood,

00:31:38.801 --> 00:31:43.707
dark, dark dried blood circles on the ground, but
no corpses, no bodies.

00:31:43.707 --> 00:31:49.383
TALIESIN: I'm going to use the broken tables and
swords to barricade the front windows or holes,

00:31:49.383 --> 00:31:54.939
I'm not sure which they are, but I'm going to
barricade them. And the door, use the sword to jam

00:31:54.939 --> 00:31:56.174
the door shut.

00:31:56.174 --> 00:31:58.894
LAURA: Are there dark corners that anybody could
be hiding in, or another room?

00:31:58.894 --> 00:32:02.138
MATT: The room itself is pretty damn dark. The
little bit of light that comes in through the

00:32:02.138 --> 00:32:07.865
distant, broken elements of the wall, there's
enough light where you can kind of-- it's very dim

00:32:07.865 --> 00:32:11.926
light for you, Percy. Everyone else with
Darkvision is all right to make out the interior.

00:32:11.926 --> 00:32:14.740
LIAM: Cursory trap check, even though it seems
unlikely.

00:32:14.740 --> 00:32:16.102
MATT: Make an investigation check.

00:32:16.102 --> 00:32:17.020
LIAM: 19.

00:32:17.020 --> 00:32:21.458
MATT: No traps from what you can gather at this
juncture. But you do hear, as you close the door

00:32:21.458 --> 00:32:27.528
and begin barricading it with Percival, you hear
the multitudes of bony claws, hands, and bits of

00:32:27.664 --> 00:32:33.537
armor slamming and brushing up against the outer
wall that you just came through. The doors (bang)

00:32:33.537 --> 00:32:37.291
as the undead have now clustered and are trying to
push their way in. They seem to have a scent.

00:32:37.291 --> 00:32:39.850
LAURA: We'll keep the censer near the door.

00:32:39.850 --> 00:32:48.854
MARISHA: Yeah, I do a little Gust cantrip and put
a little of the censer smoke under the door. I'm

00:32:48.854 --> 00:32:51.098
like an oscillating fan.

00:32:51.098 --> 00:33:03.045
MATT: Druids get pretty cool at 18, guys. Just
saying. Timeless body, oscillating fan. Best wild

00:33:03.045 --> 00:33:04.353
shape ability ever.

00:33:04.353 --> 00:33:06.567
LIAM: Wait till you see the sprinkler system.

00:33:06.567 --> 00:33:18.071
MATT: So as you're blowing the smoke from the
censer beneath the doorway, it lessens the

00:33:18.071 --> 00:33:23.368
impacts, but the undead, more than a dozen or so
of these, probably about 15 or 16 of them, have

00:33:23.368 --> 00:33:28.659
spread out, and they're all clustered at that
side. The little bit of the fumes that you can

00:33:28.659 --> 00:33:33.048
push beneath the doorway are only reaching a
handful, and it's keeping them from the main door

00:33:33.048 --> 00:33:34.009
at the moment.

00:33:34.009 --> 00:33:36.412
SAM: Can we see outside at all? Is there a
peephole or anything?

00:33:36.412 --> 00:33:41.198
MATT: There are no windows at the front of this
building. You see a sliver where it looks like a

00:33:41.198 --> 00:33:47.952
portion of the wall suffered some sort of an axe
or hatchet impact a long time ago and someone

00:33:47.952 --> 00:33:51.748
tried to pull their way through. It's maybe about
that wide, and that's where the one source of

00:33:51.748 --> 00:33:53.349
light is coming through.

00:33:53.349 --> 00:33:55.071
SAM: I'm going to go over there.

00:33:55.071 --> 00:33:56.137
LAURA: Wait.

00:33:56.137 --> 00:33:58.137
SAM: Oh. Don't do anything?

00:33:58.137 --> 00:34:05.211
LAURA: I was going to say, what if we turned
ourselves into something else and snuck out, and

00:34:05.211 --> 00:34:08.518
they would think that we're still in this
building? Anything that was tracking us.

00:34:08.518 --> 00:34:12.750
SAM: I was going to try to make a little diversion
to draw them away from the door.

00:34:12.750 --> 00:34:16.116
MATT: (boom) You guys hear a heavy impact on the
roof above.

00:34:16.116 --> 00:34:17.515
SAM: I'll do that. I'll do my thing.

00:34:17.515 --> 00:34:24.482
MATT: You hear (boom) what sounds like really
heavy footfalls along the roof of the building.

00:34:24.482 --> 00:34:28.190
SAM: I'm going to look through the little sliver
and I'm going to cast--

00:34:28.190 --> 00:34:30.357
TALIESIN: Do you want to see what they're burning
in the censer?

00:34:30.357 --> 00:34:32.514
MARISHA: Yes, I do. That's exactly what I was
going to do.

00:34:32.514 --> 00:34:34.004
TALIESIN: I'm going to open up the censer.

00:34:34.004 --> 00:34:35.628
MATT: Hold on, just a second.

00:34:35.628 --> 00:34:43.095
SAM: I'm going to cast Major Image and make a
small little human girl in the middle of the

00:34:43.095 --> 00:34:51.440
street, crying, bleeding from the arm. She looks
disoriented and she's walking towards the other

00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:57.763
building that we spotted, very sad and
(whimpering).

00:34:57.763 --> 00:35:09.566
MATT: Okay. As you glance through and create this
image, this image appears of this tiny,

00:35:09.566 --> 00:35:18.250
saucer-eyed French poppet of a girl with a little
dress. Her curls are mussed up.

00:35:18.250 --> 00:35:20.298
TRAVIS: Dragging her dolly by one arm.

00:35:20.298 --> 00:35:22.765
MATT: It's missing one button eye.

00:35:22.765 --> 00:35:25.657
LIAM: You summoned Cosette.

00:35:25.657 --> 00:35:33.113
MATT: Yes, basically. And she goes running off,
screaming and crying. You guys immediately hear

00:35:33.113 --> 00:35:39.244
the shift of the undead beyond the door (rumbling)
and begin getting fainter and fainter. As that

00:35:39.244 --> 00:35:46.446
happens, you also hear (whoosh). Scanlan, you
glance out and you watch the shadow of one of the

00:35:46.446 --> 00:35:52.334
gloom stalkers flying overhead swoop down and
attack for the little girl.

00:35:52.334 --> 00:35:57.721
SAM: Okay, she's going to run. She's going to book
it into that other building to try to get away as

00:35:57.721 --> 00:36:00.716
fast as she can. And she can move super fast since
she's not real.

00:36:00.716 --> 00:36:03.200
MATT: This is true. This is actually very true.

00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:05.351
SAM: She's like the fucking Flash.

00:36:05.351 --> 00:36:09.380
LIAM: (singing) There is a lady all in white...

00:36:09.380 --> 00:36:17.203
SAM: 120 feet is all I can move her.

00:36:17.203 --> 00:36:20.595
LAURA: She's sweeping as she's running towards the
door.

00:36:20.595 --> 00:36:32.291
MATT: Yeah. You can make her move with an action
120 feet. So the little girl goes from (whimper)

00:36:32.291 --> 00:36:38.639
to (fast running) and goes into a full sprint in a
really creepy, Ring-style way. That was for you,

00:36:38.639 --> 00:36:45.618
Travis. Across the way, and you watch as the gloom
stalker swoops up and (impact) slams into the side

00:36:45.618 --> 00:36:50.635
of the stone building, causing part of it to crush
inward and break. The roof partially (rumbling)

00:36:50.635 --> 00:36:57.053
has to settle and it falls into itself as the
creature rights itself (shriek). You now have a

00:36:57.053 --> 00:37:04.628
much closer look at this entity, and it is
billowing black shadow like smoke off of it. You

00:37:04.628 --> 00:37:08.988
can see glimpses of some sort of physical form in
there, but it's so blurry, it's almost like it's

00:37:08.988 --> 00:37:15.443
phasing between physical matter and dream. You're
not sure what it's made from, but you can see what

00:37:15.443 --> 00:37:20.481
looks to be an elongated neck, some sort of
snapping jaw at the end, and two bright,

00:37:20.481 --> 00:37:27.322
greenish-yellow glowing beacons like eyes at the
front of its face. Its wings don't have skin or

00:37:27.322 --> 00:37:32.887
flesh, it's just dark smoke, and as it flaps, it
leaves these trails, these curling bits like

00:37:32.887 --> 00:37:34.557
black, black, black smoke.

00:37:34.557 --> 00:37:36.547
LIAM: Are we talking dragon size?

00:37:36.547 --> 00:37:41.048
MATT: It's wyvern sized. It's maybe 20 feet from
wingtip to wingtip.

00:37:41.048 --> 00:37:43.395
MARISHA: Is it anything like we've ever heard
about?

00:37:43.395 --> 00:37:48.182
MATT: No, you have not encountered a creature like
this before. But you watch as it glances, and at

00:37:48.182 --> 00:37:52.541
this proximity, Scanlan, you're the one who's
getting the view of this, you watch wherever it

00:37:52.541 --> 00:37:58.406
looks, its eyes seem to emanate these tiny cones
of light, like little flashlights, and as it scans

00:37:58.406 --> 00:38:05.254
past, the little girl, where the beam goes past,
her body is nothing there.

00:38:05.254 --> 00:38:10.994
LAURA: Is there another door in this building?

00:38:10.994 --> 00:38:17.548
MATT: There is on the back side, yes. It's
partially covered by what looks to be debris, and

00:38:17.548 --> 00:38:22.355
it looks like somebody else barricaded the other
side, but did not seem to cover both ends before

00:38:22.355 --> 00:38:24.014
they fell within this building.

00:38:24.014 --> 00:38:25.225
SAM: Let's get out of here.

00:38:25.225 --> 00:38:27.253
LAURA: We should go out the other door as fast as
possible.

00:38:27.253 --> 00:38:29.074
TRAVIS: I'll take care of that barricade.

00:38:29.074 --> 00:38:31.552
LAURA: But quietly. We don't want them to know
that we're getting out the other side.

00:38:31.552 --> 00:38:33.302
TRAVIS: I don't know if I can guarantee that.

00:38:33.302 --> 00:38:34.966
MATT: What are you doing, Grog?

00:38:34.966 --> 00:38:37.492
TRAVIS: Moving shit out of the way of the door, in
a...

00:38:37.492 --> 00:38:39.629
TALIESIN: Medium pace?

00:38:39.629 --> 00:38:42.167
TRAVIS: Let's call it a medium well.

00:38:42.167 --> 00:38:46.926
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and make an athletics check.

00:38:46.926 --> 00:38:49.341
LIAM: You are a terrible stage mom, by the way.

00:38:49.341 --> 00:38:52.521
SAM: Well, she died.

00:38:52.521 --> 00:38:54.442
MATT: She's still there.

00:38:54.442 --> 00:38:56.113
SAM: She got her equity card.

00:38:56.113 --> 00:39:05.510
MATT: And that's what matters. She's still there,
and you watch, the creature seems confused. The

00:39:05.510 --> 00:39:10.509
eye beams move past it, and the little girl's
still there crying and still darting around the

00:39:10.509 --> 00:39:16.026
area, and the creature's like (snarling), lands on
the ground, and comes up and swipes and bites at

00:39:16.026 --> 00:39:21.756
her, and it goes through her form. You get the
sense these creatures aren't super intelligent,

00:39:21.756 --> 00:39:26.847
but they are effective at seeing through certain
glamors.

00:39:26.847 --> 00:39:30.428
LAURA: They're going to know that we're not. They
know we're not zombies.

00:39:30.428 --> 00:39:33.538
LIAM: Is it still after her, or has it given up on
that ghost?

00:39:33.538 --> 00:39:35.606
MATT: It's in the process of giving up on that
ghost right now.

00:39:35.606 --> 00:39:37.182
LIAM: Still a cat and a flashlight.

00:39:37.182 --> 00:39:38.549
LAURA: We've got to go.

00:39:38.549 --> 00:39:39.567
TRAVIS: 21.

00:39:39.567 --> 00:39:45.073
MATT: At this point, you watch as Grog goes over
with his giant mitts and single-handedly shifts

00:39:45.073 --> 00:39:49.255
the entire pile over with one shove, exposing the
door there before you.

00:39:49.255 --> 00:39:50.658
LAURA: Out the door, out the door.

00:39:50.658 --> 00:39:52.179
MATT: You open the doorway.

00:39:52.179 --> 00:39:54.676
SAM: Can we leave anything behind, like a dead
body or something for them to eat?

00:39:54.676 --> 00:39:56.141
LAURA: What dead body?

00:39:56.141 --> 00:39:57.901
SAM: He's got a ton of them in there.

00:39:57.901 --> 00:40:01.392
LAURA: Actually, yes. Throw a dead body in the
room.

00:40:01.392 --> 00:40:03.333
TRAVIS: Who's laughing now, bitches? Dead body!

00:40:03.333 --> 00:40:10.511
MATT: And like the world's most macabre flower
girl, you produce one of the...

00:40:10.511 --> 00:40:14.229
TRAVIS: I birth from the Bag of Holding a dead
body.

00:40:14.229 --> 00:40:20.493
LAURA: And use Dust of Tracelessness as we run out
the door, so they don't follow us.

00:40:20.493 --> 00:40:21.986
TRAVIS: Who's giving the orders around here?

00:40:21.986 --> 00:40:23.250
LAURA: Me. Please?

00:40:23.250 --> 00:40:24.493
TRAVIS: Okay.

00:40:24.493 --> 00:40:32.517
MATT: So as you throw the body behind you, the
door's now being slammed a bit. It seems some of

00:40:32.517 --> 00:40:36.489
the undead wandered towards that illusion, some
are still on the other side, and now that you've

00:40:36.489 --> 00:40:41.651
pulled the censer back from it, the other door's
kind of (bangs) coming pushed in. You can see

00:40:41.651 --> 00:40:46.533
light peeking through. You guys rush out, still
with your Seeming illusion on, and you hear, very

00:40:46.533 --> 00:40:53.292
loudly, almost omnipresent, the screech, the
(shriek) of the gloom stalker, right around the

00:40:53.292 --> 00:40:57.859
corner from you, as it begins to take off just on
the other side of the building.

00:40:57.859 --> 00:41:03.459
LAURA: Should we look for another building we can
duck into? To lose their-- So they can't find us?

00:41:03.459 --> 00:41:06.822
LIAM: Yeah, we can just go hopping from building
to building.

00:41:06.822 --> 00:41:08.905
MATT: I want everyone to roll a stealth check,
please.

00:41:08.905 --> 00:41:10.865
MARISHA: Do we still have...

00:41:10.865 --> 00:41:14.298
MATT: You do. You're getting close to the tail end
of it. You have about five minutes left.

00:41:14.298 --> 00:41:15.252
LAURA: Natural 20.

00:41:15.252 --> 00:41:16.313
SAM: Me too.

00:41:16.313 --> 00:41:17.537
MATT: Shit.

00:41:17.537 --> 00:41:19.667
TALIESIN: Thank God we still have a thing.

00:41:19.667 --> 00:41:21.848
MATT: So natural 20.

00:41:21.848 --> 00:41:22.857
TALIESIN: 21.

00:41:22.857 --> 00:41:24.225
LAURA: Did you add ten?

00:41:24.225 --> 00:41:25.200
TALIESIN: Yeah.

00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:26.346
MARISHA: 36.

00:41:26.346 --> 00:41:27.366
LIAM: 39.

00:41:27.366 --> 00:41:28.384
TALIESIN: 22, I mean.

00:41:28.384 --> 00:41:29.712
LAURA: Natural 20.

00:41:29.712 --> 00:41:30.734
ASHLEY: 22.

00:41:30.734 --> 00:41:31.764
TRAVIS: 20.

00:41:31.764 --> 00:41:32.886
MATT: Okay.

00:41:32.886 --> 00:41:35.850
TALIESIN: We did not roll well. But we're fine.

00:41:35.850 --> 00:41:39.481
MATT: So you all got above a 20. That's good.

00:41:39.481 --> 00:41:42.352
SAM: We needed above a 40.

00:41:42.352 --> 00:41:50.661
MATT: So you guys rush past and, quick glance
around, you find one of the nearby buildings. It's

00:41:50.661 --> 00:41:54.614
a little more dilapidated, but it seems to have at
least enough cover where you can all dive into the

00:41:54.614 --> 00:41:58.503
shadows and seemingly vanish. You all stand there
for a second, and you're super quiet, all

00:41:58.503 --> 00:42:04.641
breathing heavily (panting), the censer still
billowing this awful, awful fume. It's filling

00:42:04.641 --> 00:42:09.101
your nose, your eyes are watering instinctually
from the presence. It stings just to get into your

00:42:09.101 --> 00:42:13.355
sinuses, but you're all enduring it and trying to
be as quiet as possible.

00:42:13.355 --> 00:42:17.101
LAURA: Is there another door in this building that
we can exit out?

00:42:17.101 --> 00:42:19.098
MATT: Make a perception check.

00:42:19.098 --> 00:42:21.083
TALIESIN: I'm showing Keyleth what's inside the
censer.

00:42:21.083 --> 00:42:23.883
MATT: Okay, we'll get to that.

00:42:23.883 --> 00:42:24.967
LAURA: 19.

00:42:24.967 --> 00:42:31.200
MATT: 19. It's hard to tell. It looks like where
there may have been a door, a portion of the roof

00:42:31.200 --> 00:42:36.762
in here that has also collapsed, it looks like a
giant siege stone, about that big, from a catapult

00:42:36.762 --> 00:42:41.779
was launched and tore through the roof and
shattered that side of the building. The only way

00:42:41.779 --> 00:42:43.510
out is the same way you came in.

00:42:43.510 --> 00:42:44.746
LAURA: Fuck.

00:42:44.746 --> 00:42:51.093
MATT: Unless you climb up and out. But as you open
the censer and look inside, it looks like there is

00:42:51.093 --> 00:42:59.303
this ember, this cluster of burning, dried herbs.
You're not quite sure what it is or where it came

00:42:59.303 --> 00:43:02.830
from, but it's currently glowing red in places.

00:43:02.830 --> 00:43:08.499
TALIESIN: I'm going to give some of the herbs to
Keyleth to examine. It's like on a charcoal?

00:43:08.499 --> 00:43:15.932
MATT: It has what looks to be charcoal stones in
the bottom clustered around, and these herbs are

00:43:15.932 --> 00:43:18.651
placed over it, and it's burning and smoldering
over time.

00:43:18.651 --> 00:43:20.825
MARISHA: Sure. Can I tell what the herbs are?

00:43:20.825 --> 00:43:22.992
MATT: Make a medicine check. No, this would be a
nature check, sorry.

00:43:22.992 --> 00:43:27.330
MARISHA: Thank you. Is this something that I would
get advantage on for my herb book?

00:43:27.330 --> 00:43:29.509
MATT: Yes, you would.

00:43:29.509 --> 00:43:33.975
MARISHA: 28.

00:43:33.975 --> 00:43:36.485
MATT: Okay. I get to look this up.

00:43:36.485 --> 00:43:43.134
SAM: Oh, look it up. It's a real thing. Wow.

00:43:43.134 --> 00:43:59.460
MATT: It's called Wild's Guide. It's a
tobacco-like leaf that was used... It was briefly

00:43:59.460 --> 00:44:12.883
used for recreational smoking and treatment of
small wounds, but it tended to have a very quick

00:44:12.883 --> 00:44:19.819
diseased, sickening sense to it. Those that smoked
a lot tended to get sick very quickly, and it went

00:44:19.819 --> 00:44:26.814
into disuse from there. It's largely considered to
be a relatively useless plant. There isn't a lot

00:44:26.814 --> 00:44:32.523
of medicinal quality to it. It's just something
that exists in herbalism books,

00:44:32.523 --> 00:44:34.286
as things to avoid.

00:44:34.286 --> 00:44:38.147
TALIESIN: Comes in green and red, available in the
Resident Evil universe.

00:44:38.147 --> 00:44:46.397
MATT: You get the sense that them using it for the
censer is probably not a widely known use for this

00:44:46.397 --> 00:44:47.359
type of plant.

00:44:47.359 --> 00:44:49.792
LAURA: You found a new use!

00:44:49.792 --> 00:44:56.948
MARISHA: I did! I write it down and I press a
flower, or I save some of it. And then can I

00:44:56.948 --> 00:45:01.319
Druidcraft some more, now that I know what it is?

00:45:01.319 --> 00:45:06.588
MATT: From that cluster, I'd say yeah, you can
create a little bit more, but very little bit.

00:45:06.588 --> 00:45:09.175
MARISHA: Okay, I'll go ahead and make as much as I
can.

00:45:09.175 --> 00:45:14.158
MATT: Okay, so you spend some time there to focus
on it, and from the remnants there you can make

00:45:14.158 --> 00:45:18.673
about twice the amount than what was in the
censer, so you have probably a good, solid

00:45:18.673 --> 00:45:21.019
softball-sized cluster.

00:45:21.019 --> 00:45:22.491
TALIESIN: The resin's the best part.

00:45:22.491 --> 00:45:29.496
MARISHA: Okay. I take half, put half back in the
censer, and give half to Percy. Does anybody else

00:45:29.496 --> 00:45:34.797
want some? Actually, should we dab ourselves with
it? No, is that weird?

00:45:34.797 --> 00:45:39.196
LAURA: Maybe just give it to Percy.

00:45:39.196 --> 00:45:41.531
MATT: Really? After all that, no dab joke?
Anyway.

00:45:41.531 --> 00:45:43.348
SAM: Too classy for us.

00:45:43.348 --> 00:45:44.982
MATT: I guess so.

00:45:44.982 --> 00:45:48.841
TALIESIN: Whatever the opposite of standards are,
I know we have them.

00:45:48.841 --> 00:45:51.986
MARISHA: Give some to Percy, anybody else want
some?

00:45:51.986 --> 00:45:57.752
LAURA: Yeah, yeah. I don't have any way to make
fire, but I'll take it.

00:45:57.752 --> 00:45:59.202
Definitely in my shirt now.

00:45:59.202 --> 00:46:06.773
MATT: As you guys are doing this, you hear the
(snarling), and you hear the (flapping wings).

00:46:06.773 --> 00:46:18.695
It's hunting from building to building. (impacts)
Closer. (flapping wings) (snarling) A little

00:46:18.695 --> 00:46:26.312
further away. (flapping wings)

00:46:26.312 --> 00:46:29.502
LAURA: It's gone? Did it fly away?

00:46:29.502 --> 00:46:31.424
MATT: Sounds like it, at least.

00:46:31.424 --> 00:46:36.717
LAURA: Should we leave, and go to another
building?

00:46:36.717 --> 00:46:38.037
SAM: Let's keep going.

00:46:38.037 --> 00:46:40.923
LIAM: Building to building toward the tower?

00:46:40.923 --> 00:46:44.063
LAURA: I feel like it's not really gone.

00:46:44.063 --> 00:46:47.375
LIAM: Well, we'll find out. Let's make a break for
it.

00:46:47.375 --> 00:46:55.271
MATT: Okay, who's going first? Okay. Vax, as you
dart along the side, glancing up in the air, you

00:46:55.271 --> 00:47:01.834
can still see. And it looks like there is some
communication, because where once there was maybe

00:47:01.834 --> 00:47:07.046
two, you can now see a lot of them have clustered
closer in your direction. There seems to be some

00:47:07.046 --> 00:47:08.683
sort of an overhead hunt.

00:47:08.683 --> 00:47:12.579
LAURA: Should I cast Pass Without a Trace on us
again? Are we running out of time on it?

00:47:12.579 --> 00:47:13.976
MATT: You're getting pretty close, yeah.

00:47:13.976 --> 00:47:15.885
LAURA: I'm going to cast it again, just so we
don't.

00:47:15.885 --> 00:47:18.726
MATT: Okay, so you cast Pass Without a Trace again.

00:47:18.726 --> 00:47:22.972
LIAM: And are we, Without a Trace and Dust of
Tracelessness? That's just a one time...

00:47:22.972 --> 00:47:25.569
LAURA: Dust of Tracelessness is just so they can't
track us.

00:47:25.569 --> 00:47:32.299
MATT: So the second thing you've gathered, these
creatures are not very intelligent, but they do

00:47:32.299 --> 00:47:39.818
have some sort of communication between them, and
there apparently is a rush on their end to search

00:47:39.818 --> 00:47:48.861
for whatever was recently spotted. So as you guys
make your way, following Vax's lead, down some of

00:47:48.861 --> 00:47:54.961
the alleyways, and begin slithering through the
back ways and the small side streets, avoiding

00:47:54.961 --> 00:47:58.326
your first attempt to walk straight through the
center of the town.

00:47:58.326 --> 00:48:02.668
LAURA: It's crazy how that didn't work, though. I
mean, because it was a really smart plan.

00:48:02.668 --> 00:48:09.734
MATT: It worked for a bit. Not every plan is going
to hold you to the very end. There was some

00:48:09.734 --> 00:48:19.412
cleverness to it. So you begin to move through
these buildings before-- It would be Keyleth, Vex

00:48:19.412 --> 00:48:28.491
and Vax. You guys come around one small alley and
it opens up into another main road, and this

00:48:28.491 --> 00:48:34.510
road's hard to avoid. It seems to be almost a
circular central road that marks the outer and

00:48:34.510 --> 00:48:43.397
inner rings of Thar Amphala. But you see there,
marking right across this road, a 15 foot tall

00:48:43.397 --> 00:48:50.711
wall that seems to lock in the inner cloister of
the town.

00:48:50.711 --> 00:48:53.000
MARISHA: How thick does it appear to be?

00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:55.817
MATT: Make a perception check.

00:48:55.817 --> 00:48:59.451
LAURA: Maybe we can go under it.

00:48:59.451 --> 00:49:06.315
MARISHA: Or through it. 17.

00:49:06.315 --> 00:49:11.900
MATT: It's hard to tell from this perspective. You
have to get a better glance. You have to find if

00:49:11.900 --> 00:49:19.626
there was a break in the wall anywhere. You do see
what looks to be some variation in texture a

00:49:19.626 --> 00:49:25.491
little ways to the right. It could be a gate, it
could be a door, it could be an opening, or it

00:49:25.491 --> 00:49:33.255
could be some change in its rather solid, not very
varied exterior.

00:49:33.255 --> 00:49:38.170
MARISHA: Go to the gate?

00:49:38.170 --> 00:49:39.819
SAM: Yeah.

00:49:39.819 --> 00:49:41.425
MARISHA: Okay.

00:49:41.425 --> 00:49:50.044
LIAM: Why don't the half-elves go real quick, just
to stay small and quiet. No clanking, no crushing.

00:49:50.044 --> 00:49:52.777
You take a look at the wall, and then we just call
everybody up.

00:49:52.777 --> 00:49:55.550
Just two seconds if it's the way to go.

00:49:55.550 --> 00:49:59.969
LAURA: Is it far away? It's like 15 feet from us
you said? Is it farther than that?

00:49:59.969 --> 00:50:02.172
MATT: Probably about 60 feet down to the right of
you guys.

00:50:02.172 --> 00:50:08.853
LIAM: So the change in the wall's about 60 feet,
but the wall from our hiding spot is

00:50:08.853 --> 00:50:10.300
how far away from us?

00:50:10.300 --> 00:50:16.820
MATT: Across the way it's about 30 feet from you.
it's only about 15 feet tall, it's not crazy big.

00:50:16.820 --> 00:50:25.197
MARISHA: I'll see if I can discern something here
a little bit better. You go. Go check it out.

00:50:25.197 --> 00:50:27.050
LAURA: Sure.

00:50:27.050 --> 00:50:32.602
MATT: So the two of you dart off to the side,
following Keyleth's impression of where she saw

00:50:32.602 --> 00:50:39.273
this shift, and as you make your way along the
edge, you glance over and you see two things. One,

00:50:39.273 --> 00:50:47.825
there does indeed appear to be a small, cut
doorway in the wall, maybe about six feet up,

00:50:47.825 --> 00:50:53.303
three feet wide, that's designed for a single file
passage of any creature that wishes to move

00:50:53.303 --> 00:50:59.355
through. It's open. There's no closed door there.
Above it, just above it, about eight feet up, you

00:50:59.355 --> 00:51:07.061
see what appears to be a deep cerulean blue
gemstone, about two feet across, that's embedded

00:51:07.061 --> 00:51:08.901
within the wall.

00:51:08.901 --> 00:51:11.012
LIAM: I think it's fine.

00:51:11.012 --> 00:51:12.612
SAM: Just go through the hole.

00:51:12.612 --> 00:51:14.164
LIAM: We're good. We found it.

00:51:14.164 --> 00:51:18.761
MATT: It's a big blue stone, about that big
around. It's embedded

00:51:18.761 --> 00:51:20.169
into the wall above the door.

00:51:20.169 --> 00:51:23.082
MARISHA: I ask them, how thick does the wall
appear to be around that side?

00:51:23.082 --> 00:51:26.757
LIAM: Looking through the door, can we tell how
deep?

00:51:26.757 --> 00:51:32.610
MATT: Yeah, actually, you can. It's about three
feet wide, four feet wide.

00:51:32.610 --> 00:51:35.362
LAURA: The depth of the wall?

00:51:35.362 --> 00:51:38.013
MATT: The depth of the wall, yeah. It's a big,
heavy wall.

00:51:38.013 --> 00:51:39.872
TRAVIS: Vex, I bet if you go real fast, you can
totally make it.

00:51:39.872 --> 00:51:42.053
LAURA: Good idea, Grog. I'll definitely try it.

00:51:42.053 --> 00:51:44.275
MARISHA: I can try and Stone Shape through it.

00:51:44.275 --> 00:51:51.723
MATT: You two... recognize, at least, there's
something very familiar about that stone embedded

00:51:51.723 --> 00:51:53.210
in the wall.

00:51:53.210 --> 00:51:55.175
TRAVIS: It's blue.

00:51:55.175 --> 00:52:09.149
MATT: It's definitely blue. It's very similar in
size, installation, and functional placement as

00:52:09.149 --> 00:52:12.264
the threshold crests that adorn the exterior of
Syngorn.

00:52:12.264 --> 00:52:18.757
LAURA: Which are definitely used... Wait. To
teleport things?

00:52:18.757 --> 00:52:24.002
MATT: The ones that are used to transport Syngorn
to the Feywild and back.

00:52:24.002 --> 00:52:29.357
MARISHA: Oh, weird. Oh no.

00:52:29.357 --> 00:52:37.567
LAURA: Oh my god, if the ritual finishes, they can
teleport this whole fucking city. Shit.

00:52:37.567 --> 00:52:39.012
We have to stop this.

00:52:39.012 --> 00:52:40.893
MARISHA: What if we dismantle the gems?

00:52:40.893 --> 00:52:43.709
TALIESIN: We would probably have to dismantle a
bunch of them.

00:52:43.709 --> 00:52:47.627
TRAVIS: We're out in the open. Dismantling that's
pretty tough.

00:52:47.627 --> 00:52:53.664
TALIESIN: I feel like it would be easier to wreck
the operator than try to break the machine.

00:52:53.664 --> 00:52:55.194
LAURA: I don't know.

00:52:55.194 --> 00:52:58.861
SAM: I mean, we've got a guy who crushes rocks all
the time.

00:52:58.861 --> 00:53:01.572
LAURA: Yeah, but I don't think it's safe to touch
those things.

00:53:01.572 --> 00:53:06.498
LIAM: And the moment he makes a ruckus, the air
squad is coming down on our location immediately.

00:53:06.498 --> 00:53:10.584
MARISHA: Didn't we take some of that crystal?
Didn't we take some of that?

00:53:10.584 --> 00:53:12.254
TALIESIN: Which crystal?

00:53:12.254 --> 00:53:14.672
MARISHA: Didn't we take shards of it from the
thresholds in Syngorn?

00:53:14.672 --> 00:53:17.918
LAURA: I don't remember. I don't have any in my
bag.

00:53:17.918 --> 00:53:20.522
MARISHA: One of them shattered, and I feel like we
took some.

00:53:20.522 --> 00:53:21.763
TRAVIS: Yeah, I did.

00:53:21.763 --> 00:53:22.753
LAURA: You did?

00:53:22.753 --> 00:53:24.595
TRAVIS: Yeah, shards of blue crystal.

00:53:24.595 --> 00:53:27.822
LAURA: Matt's like, uh...

00:53:27.822 --> 00:53:32.921
MARISHA: I don't know, maybe it's useful in this
case?

00:53:32.921 --> 00:53:35.778
TRAVIS: It's not pretty, it's all broken.

00:53:35.778 --> 00:53:46.036
LIAM: One question is, if these stones are used to
pull this tower into the main realms, is there

00:53:46.036 --> 00:53:50.263
another purpose to them here, or is that doorway
safe, is what I'm wondering?

00:53:50.263 --> 00:53:52.261
LAURA: No, that doorway is in no way safe.

00:53:52.261 --> 00:53:56.824
MARISHA: Where was the gem embedded in the
doorway?

00:53:56.824 --> 00:53:59.451
MATT: About eight feet up. About two feet above
the doorway.

00:53:59.451 --> 00:54:02.159
LIAM: I feel like we should go through the wall or
over it, just on principle.

00:54:02.159 --> 00:54:04.432
TALIESIN: We can go over it. We do have a magic
carpet.

00:54:04.432 --> 00:54:08.059
LAURA: Yeah, and all the flying creatures are
going to see us immediately. We either go under

00:54:08.059 --> 00:54:13.428
the wall... How far from the wall to the tower is
it? Does it seem?

00:54:13.428 --> 00:54:14.719
MATT: Probably...

00:54:14.719 --> 00:54:16.637
LAURA: Can we see the tower through the doorway?

00:54:16.637 --> 00:54:22.216
MATT: You can see across, and it's not a straight
shot, but you can get low and you can see where it

00:54:22.216 --> 00:54:27.733
breaks. Since you have a good sense of direction,
being the ranger, I'd say you know it's at least

00:54:27.733 --> 00:54:28.911
under a mile.

00:54:28.911 --> 00:54:35.070
LAURA: A mile to the tower? So it's probably two
miles wide, this whole...?

00:54:35.070 --> 00:54:39.756
MATT: Probably less. It's hard to pinpoint
directly from what little you can see, but it's

00:54:39.756 --> 00:54:44.088
definitely within a mile to a half mile of that
door, that wall.

00:54:44.088 --> 00:54:47.560
LIAM: Kiki, would you be able to Great Escape us
underneath this wall?

00:54:47.560 --> 00:54:51.526
LAURA: Yeah, that's what I'm thinking. What if we
go under the ground all the way to the tower?

00:54:51.526 --> 00:54:54.739
MARISHA: Is it unworked stone? What's the ground
like?

00:54:54.739 --> 00:55:03.260
MATT: The ground is unworked stone. It is broken
dirt and earth and stone. From what you gather, at

00:55:03.260 --> 00:55:05.415
the very least. A heavy layer of dust.

00:55:05.415 --> 00:55:11.677
MARISHA: I could attempt to tunnel us there.
Percy, I'm sure you would know more than anyone.

00:55:11.677 --> 00:55:16.368
What's the likelihood that we might encounter,
that I might bust through a dungeon or something,

00:55:16.368 --> 00:55:17.636
though, over there?

00:55:17.636 --> 00:55:20.389
TALIESIN: That would be the question. It's A,
where do we come up? B, how do we tunnel without

00:55:20.389 --> 00:55:25.705
collapsing a building on us? And C, what if
there's buried dead

00:55:25.705 --> 00:55:27.775
that haven't been able to break?

00:55:27.775 --> 00:55:31.724
MARISHA: I can get us under the wall for sure. I
can do both,

00:55:31.724 --> 00:55:34.219
it's just figuring out what we want to do.

00:55:34.219 --> 00:55:37.221
TALIESIN: If we can tunnel under the wall and then
come up in a building.

00:55:37.221 --> 00:55:40.828
LIAM: I think so. We're not trying to get all the
way there, just past this.

00:55:40.828 --> 00:55:42.965
MARISHA: Okay. Can I Stone Shape--

00:55:42.965 --> 00:55:45.128
LAURA: From within a building.

00:55:45.128 --> 00:55:47.473
MARISHA: -- a crawlspace through the wall?

00:55:47.473 --> 00:55:51.578
MATT: Yeah, you can probably do that. Let me look
at the Stone Shape spell here real fast.

00:55:51.578 --> 00:55:54.981
MARISHA: Big enough for at least Grog to marine
belly through?

00:55:54.981 --> 00:55:57.815
TRAVIS: We're all undead, so I'm a little smaller
right now, actually.

00:55:57.815 --> 00:56:00.063
MATT: Well, you look smaller.

00:56:00.063 --> 00:56:01.462
TALIESIN: You look smaller than you are.

00:56:01.462 --> 00:56:03.141
MATT: You're still your same height.

00:56:03.141 --> 00:56:06.790
TALIESIN: You would be a little zombie, floating,
stuck.

00:56:06.790 --> 00:56:08.681
LAURA: Can we be zombie cows?

00:56:08.681 --> 00:56:18.253
MATT: Stone Shape is instantaneous, and it's a
section no more than five feet in any dimension,

00:56:18.253 --> 00:56:22.628
so Stone Shape would be just a one-hit boom. You
could not create a long tunnel.

00:56:22.628 --> 00:56:26.873
MARISHA: But I can't carve a shape through the
wall to just crawl through, five feet?

00:56:26.873 --> 00:56:28.165
MATT: Oh, through the actual wall itself?

00:56:28.165 --> 00:56:32.241
MARISHA: Yeah, through the wall, not under the
ground. I want to bust a crawl space through the

00:56:32.241 --> 00:56:33.369
bottom of the wall.

00:56:33.369 --> 00:56:34.937
LAURA: Don't you think the flying guys will notice
that?

00:56:34.937 --> 00:56:37.314
MATT: Yeah, that could work. So do you want to do
that?

00:56:37.314 --> 00:56:41.211
MARISHA: It's not a dynamite blast, it's like a
(rumble).

00:56:41.211 --> 00:56:42.775
SAM: Yeah, it's just a hole in the wall.

00:56:42.775 --> 00:56:43.910
TALIESIN: It's like butter.

00:56:43.910 --> 00:56:45.311
MARISHA: Yeah, it's like butter. So...

00:56:45.311 --> 00:56:49.714
MATT: Okay. So you dart across the open road to
the other side, where the wall is.

00:56:49.714 --> 00:56:51.009
MARISHA: Cover for me.

00:56:51.009 --> 00:56:52.069
TRAVIS: How would we do that?

00:56:52.069 --> 00:56:53.307
TALIESIN: We are stealthed.

00:56:53.307 --> 00:56:54.410
LAURA: Yeah.

00:56:54.410 --> 00:56:57.780
MATT: Okay.

00:56:57.780 --> 00:57:03.763
LAURA: Can I-- Shit, well, you already rolled. Can
I have been keeping an eye on the sky and give her

00:57:03.763 --> 00:57:06.355
a go ahead when it looks like they're not going to
see her?

00:57:06.355 --> 00:57:09.623
MATT: You begin to do so as she runs across the
road.

00:57:09.623 --> 00:57:11.731
MARISHA: What?

00:57:11.731 --> 00:57:13.394
LAURA: Just go. Just fucking go.

00:57:13.394 --> 00:57:14.500
MARISHA: Okay.

00:57:14.500 --> 00:57:19.673
MATT: You hear the distant shrieks, communication
between the various gloom stalkers that (snarling)

00:57:19.673 --> 00:57:26.704
echoing in the sky. You make it all the way across
to the wall, and get low, focus, close your eyes,

00:57:26.704 --> 00:57:38.718
press your hand against the cold, dark wall, and
feel it (whoosh) as immediately, you carve a

00:57:38.718 --> 00:57:45.591
circular tunnel through that goes completely to
the other side. Seemingly to no negative effect.

00:57:45.591 --> 00:57:50.138
MARISHA: Seemingly to no negative effect, I've
made a tunnel.

00:57:50.138 --> 00:57:53.852
SAM: You sound different. Why are you using weird
words?

00:57:53.852 --> 00:57:57.804
MARISHA: I'm whispering! I'm just trying to be
more pragmatic.

00:57:57.804 --> 00:57:58.832
SAM: Let's go.

00:57:58.832 --> 00:58:00.999
LAURA: Hey, guys, we didn't eat a Heroes' Feast
yet, either.

00:58:00.999 --> 00:58:02.120
SAM: We didn't heal ourselves.

00:58:02.120 --> 00:58:03.363
MARISHA: No, we didn't.

00:58:03.363 --> 00:58:04.475
TALIESIN: We've got to get through the wall.

00:58:04.475 --> 00:58:05.685
SAM: Let's get through the wall, and then we'll
heal.

00:58:05.685 --> 00:58:08.179
MATT: Okay.

00:58:08.179 --> 00:58:18.355
TRAVIS: He is looking at each one of us and
rolling.

00:58:18.355 --> 00:58:20.901
TALIESIN: He's making eye contact and rolling a
die, like it means something.

00:58:20.901 --> 00:58:22.587
LAURA: I'm not going to look at him.

00:58:22.587 --> 00:58:24.362
MARISHA: Keeping track. Why is he keeping track?

00:58:24.362 --> 00:58:25.862
LIAM: If I don't look, he can't kill me.

00:58:25.862 --> 00:58:27.314
ASHLEY: If you don't make eye contact.

00:58:27.314 --> 00:58:29.931
LAURA: It's like in school, if you don't make eye
contact, maybe they won't call on you.

00:58:29.931 --> 00:58:36.856
MATT: Yeah, it's the old Warner Brothers rule. So
as you guys all, one by one, dart across and leap

00:58:36.856 --> 00:58:40.346
beneath the tunnel that Keyleth had created,
Keyleth, have you gone through the tunnel, or are

00:58:40.346 --> 00:58:41.768
you seeing everyone else through?

00:58:41.768 --> 00:58:44.498
MARISHA: I'll wait and see everyone else through,
just in case.

00:58:44.498 --> 00:58:46.711
TRAVIS: Oh, how generous of you.

00:58:46.711 --> 00:58:52.381
LAURA: We all are dead.

00:58:52.381 --> 00:58:55.310
MATT: You all begin darting through, one after
another.

00:58:55.310 --> 00:58:57.162
MARISHA: I'm going to try and keep a lookout.

00:58:57.162 --> 00:59:05.391
MATT: Keyleth, you glance up as, at the very tail
end of it, you have Scanlan and Pike at the very

00:59:05.391 --> 00:59:07.300
end, ready to rush through the tunnel.

00:59:07.300 --> 00:59:08.540
SAM: We're slow.

00:59:08.540 --> 00:59:14.227
MATT: Because of the gnomish feet. They both get
there as you glance up and watch as one of the

00:59:14.227 --> 00:59:23.622
gloom stalkers (shriek) and goes into a full
screeching dive towards you outside of the wall.

00:59:23.622 --> 00:59:25.309
What are you guys doing?

00:59:25.309 --> 00:59:27.298
SAM: Hurrying.

00:59:27.298 --> 00:59:30.309
ASHLEY: Jumping through as fast as our little
gnome feet can take us.

00:59:30.309 --> 00:59:35.663
MATT: Okay, so Pike, you dart through, Scanlan,
you dart through. With the size of the tunnel,

00:59:35.663 --> 00:59:38.888
it's easy enough for the both of you to just run
through while crouching as opposed to having to

00:59:38.888 --> 00:59:43.417
get on your hands and knees, so you guys start
making your way through to the side. Pike, you

00:59:43.417 --> 00:59:46.273
make it out the other side. Scanlan, you're
halfway through. Keyleth, you're still there,

00:59:46.273 --> 00:59:49.223
ready to go in after as it's about to bear down on
you.

00:59:49.223 --> 00:59:50.577
MARISHA: It's not coming up?

00:59:50.577 --> 00:59:54.204
MATT: Oh, no, it's going for a straight dive. It's
going right for you.

00:59:54.204 --> 00:59:58.653
MARISHA: Oh, god, am I trying to do anything but
get through?

00:59:58.653 --> 01:00:00.172
LIAM: You're running! Come on!

01:00:00.172 --> 01:00:01.711
LAURA: She has to duck down.

01:00:01.711 --> 01:00:03.312
MARISHA: I don't know, I've got to crawl through!

01:00:03.312 --> 01:00:05.959
LAURA: Yeah. So do you have protection? Do you
have something you could turn into?

01:00:05.959 --> 01:00:12.355
MARISHA: Yeah! Thank you! Thank you! I'm going to
see it and immediately Beast Shape into a little

01:00:12.355 --> 01:00:14.706
mouse and (crawling sounds) through.

01:00:14.706 --> 01:00:20.542
MATT: I want you to roll an initiative roll to see
whether or not it gets to you in time.

01:00:20.542 --> 01:00:22.703
SAM: Am I rolling, too, since I'm half-out?

01:00:22.703 --> 01:00:25.079
MATT: You're halfway in the tunnel. It couldn't
fit in the tunnel if it wanted to.

01:00:25.079 --> 01:00:26.578
SAM: But, I mean, am I watching this?

01:00:26.578 --> 01:00:27.673
MATT: You're watching this.

01:00:27.673 --> 01:00:29.819
SAM: I'm going to roll. Okay.

01:00:29.819 --> 01:00:32.123
LIAM: I'm going to say that I didn't leave the
other side of the wall when I realized that she

01:00:32.123 --> 01:00:34.767
wasn't coming through. So, waiting right in front
of Scanlan.

01:00:34.767 --> 01:00:36.248
MARISHA: 18.

01:00:36.248 --> 01:00:37.378
SAM: Two for me.

01:00:37.378 --> 01:00:46.425
MATT: Okay. Natural 19 plus three. So, as you
shift down into the tiny mouse-like form, its

01:00:46.425 --> 01:00:55.249
claws immediately slam into and sink into the
mouse body. Yeah, that's a 23 to hit.

01:00:55.249 --> 01:00:57.776
MARISHA: Yeah. Immediately poof.

01:00:57.776 --> 01:01:01.597
MATT: How much hit points does your mouse form
have? Like one?

01:01:01.597 --> 01:01:04.739
MARISHA: I'm assuming no more than a kitten's
worth.

01:01:04.739 --> 01:01:11.459
MATT: Right, so yeah. So, we'll say for the
purposes, one. So that would be 16 points of

01:01:11.459 --> 01:01:16.560
piercing damage, so your form immediately reverts,
its claws now fill with your regular Keyleth form.

01:01:16.560 --> 01:01:20.528
You take 15 points of piercing damage, Keyleth,
and you are grappled.

01:01:20.528 --> 01:01:23.540
MARISHA: Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool story. Cool.

01:01:23.540 --> 01:01:28.019
MATT: As soon as it grabs you, it begins to pull
you out of the tunnel

01:01:28.019 --> 01:01:29.799
and lift with you in its claws.

01:01:29.799 --> 01:01:33.152
ASHLEY: Can I grab her arms?

01:01:33.152 --> 01:01:35.748
MATT: You're on the other side of the wall.
Scanlan's on the other side right now.

01:01:35.748 --> 01:01:39.054
LIAM: I'm three feet away from you.

01:01:39.054 --> 01:01:41.224
LAURA: Yeah, but he's in front of you.

01:01:41.224 --> 01:01:47.303
MATT: Everyone else on the other side of the wall,
Scanlan in the middle, Keyleth in the front. You

01:01:47.303 --> 01:01:51.424
saw it shriek and dive down, you don't know what
happened from that point. You can glance down and

01:01:51.424 --> 01:01:55.909
you watch as Keyleth is being pulled up. You see
that happening. Scanlan, what are you doing?

01:01:55.909 --> 01:02:02.270
SAM: I'll yell to the rest: it's got Keyleth. I'll
cast Dominate Monster on it, I guess.

01:02:02.270 --> 01:02:08.237
MATT: Okay. So, what's the spell DC on that?

01:02:08.237 --> 01:02:12.809
SAM: Well, I was probably not fast enough to pull
up my horn, so 20.

01:02:12.809 --> 01:02:21.976
MATT: That's a natural four plus three. So, as you
say that and turn around, you bring your hand up

01:02:21.976 --> 01:02:27.320
and begin muttering the incantation and finish it
with a &lt;i&gt;flourish!&lt;/i&gt;

01:02:27.320 --> 01:02:31.586
SAM: I could have just done that this whole
time?!

01:02:31.586 --> 01:02:40.131
MATT: As you finish the incantation, you watch as
a small ring of glowing purple-pink glyphs appear

01:02:40.131 --> 01:02:46.990
like a crown around the outside, floating about
three inches from the gloom stalker's "head." Its

01:02:46.990 --> 01:02:50.894
shriek goes (intense to calm croaking) and it's
just there, hovering in the air, about ten feet

01:02:50.894 --> 01:02:52.339
up, clutching Keyleth.

01:02:52.339 --> 01:03:00.978
SAM: All right. Please deposit her on the other
side. Over the wall.

01:03:00.978 --> 01:03:08.609
MATT: You guys watch as the gloom stalker (wings
flapping) over the wall. Lands on the ground,

01:03:08.609 --> 01:03:11.425
slamming Keyleth. It slams you into the ground as
it lands.

01:03:11.425 --> 01:03:14.271
You take five points of bludgeoning damage.

01:03:14.271 --> 01:03:17.226
MARISHA: (wheezing) You could have told it
gently!

01:03:17.226 --> 01:03:18.978
SAM: I don't speak Gloom!

01:03:18.978 --> 01:03:20.931
MARISHA: Five points?

01:03:20.931 --> 01:03:25.837
MATT: Yes. You (wham) and almost knocks the wind
out of you, and you slam into the hard ground, but

01:03:25.837 --> 01:03:27.745
the claws unfurl and leave you.

01:03:27.745 --> 01:03:30.935
MARISHA: (wheezing) I made it, guys! I'm glad you
made it!

01:03:30.935 --> 01:03:33.426
SAM: Only 59 more minutes.

01:03:33.426 --> 01:03:36.782
ASHLEY: Maybe he can tell the others to leave us
alone!

01:03:36.782 --> 01:03:38.694
MARISHA: Yeah, call them off!

01:03:38.694 --> 01:03:42.275
TALIESIN: Or maybe there are birds on the other
side of the wall.

01:03:42.275 --> 01:03:46.078
SAM: Does he keep rerolling for breaking, or is
that it?

01:03:46.078 --> 01:03:48.725
MARISHA: Tell them it's handled, we're dead.

01:03:48.725 --> 01:03:51.350
TALIESIN: And then we can ride him!

01:03:51.350 --> 01:03:56.746
LAURA: Ask him if he has any money, and ask him if
he can make a good dinner because I'm hungry.

01:03:56.746 --> 01:03:58.882
MARISHA: Where's the nearest 7-11?

01:03:58.882 --> 01:04:04.530
MATT: Each time the target takes damage. It has to
take damage to get the save. So, it's under your

01:04:04.530 --> 01:04:06.369
control for an hour or until it takes damage.

01:04:06.369 --> 01:04:17.794
SAM: All right. First things first, please go tell
your fellow gloomy friends that the hunt is off.

01:04:17.794 --> 01:04:24.523
No more flesh down here. And come back!

01:04:24.523 --> 01:04:32.474
MATT: (croaking) You can see that it's landed, its
giant wings have folded under into these folded

01:04:32.474 --> 01:04:39.034
knuckle-like claws that hit the ground as it
(croaks) and he gets really close and snarls at

01:04:39.034 --> 01:04:44.162
you. As it gets close, the air gets colder in its
presence, it's almost like it brings this drop.

01:04:44.162 --> 01:04:50.639
It's already pretty cold here in the Shadowfell,
but it becomes pretty much freezing as soon as it gets

01:04:50.639 --> 01:04:57.619
within five feet of you. It seems to suck heat out
of the air. As it's glaring at you, (wings

01:04:57.619 --> 01:05:04.709
flapping) begins to take up. You can see three
other gloom stalkers who saw it dive earlier are

01:05:04.709 --> 01:05:12.658
all arriving towards your location. As it rides up
towards them, you hear (gloom stalker speech) and

01:05:12.658 --> 01:05:18.523
the other ones (gloom stalker speech) snap at it, circle
it and they all have what looks like an argument,

01:05:18.523 --> 01:05:26.065
if there was. And then, eventually, they break and
they begin shouting off (gloom stalker speech).

01:05:26.065 --> 01:05:31.521
You watch as the heavy clusters that had been
swarming this area of the town begin to respond in

01:05:31.521 --> 01:05:36.524
kind. You hear the echoes, the cacophony of
various screeches and screams and they all begin

01:05:36.524 --> 01:05:40.613
to slowly dissipate and diffuse amongst the entire
city of Thar Amphala.

01:05:40.613 --> 01:05:42.269
TALIESIN: Well, that went well.

01:05:42.269 --> 01:05:43.465
LAURA: Good job, Scanlan.

01:05:43.465 --> 01:05:44.829
LIAM: Welcome back, Scanlan Shorthalt.

01:05:44.829 --> 01:05:46.065
MARISHA: Thanks, Scanlan!

01:05:46.065 --> 01:05:48.985
SAM: It's good to be back. Okay, we'll need a name
for him, obviously.

01:05:48.985 --> 01:05:50.008
LAURA: Yes.

01:05:50.008 --> 01:05:52.067
SAM: So, anybody got any ideas?

01:05:52.067 --> 01:05:53.160
LAURA: Benjamin is what I'm thinking.

01:05:53.160 --> 01:05:54.635
SAM: Benjamin is great.

01:05:54.635 --> 01:05:56.421
MARISHA: Mr. Mistoffelees!

01:05:56.421 --> 01:05:58.165
SAM: That's way better.

01:05:58.165 --> 01:06:00.664
(laughing)

01:06:00.664 --> 01:06:03.584
TALIESIN: Can we ride him to the tower?

01:06:03.584 --> 01:06:10.914
SAM: Well, some of us can, right? By looking at
him, how much can he carry? Or she!

01:06:10.914 --> 01:06:20.220
MATT: You're not certain, based on its size, it
could maybe carry three medium to small people.

01:06:20.220 --> 01:06:21.639
SAM: Okay.

01:06:21.639 --> 01:06:24.024
MARISHA: (whispered) What's around us right now?

01:06:24.024 --> 01:06:25.684
(regular volume) Sorry, what's around us right
now?

01:06:25.684 --> 01:06:30.713
MATT: So, as you glance around the other side of the
wall, the city is denser within this inner

01:06:30.779 --> 01:06:43.280
cloister, and the buildings all seem to be newer.
Or repaired. It seems like this inner sanctum of

01:06:43.280 --> 01:06:50.693
Thar Amphala has garnished most of the attention
of those that currently reside within its space.

01:06:50.693 --> 01:06:59.302
As you are glancing up, too, you see the flicker,
the faint flicker of the conjoining strands of

01:06:59.302 --> 01:07:05.718
magical energy that are rising up to the pinnacle
of the tower of Entropis where you see these three

01:07:05.718 --> 01:07:11.458
heavy claw-like fingers that jut out of the top of
the tower all curve inward. The flash is in the

01:07:11.458 --> 01:07:20.207
center of it, it's just glowing brighter and
brighter. That pulsing is (pulsing). It's almost

01:07:20.207 --> 01:07:27.907
like seeing this heartbeat of pure energy that's
swelling and swelling.

01:07:27.907 --> 01:07:30.555
LAURA: I don't think we have time to stop.

01:07:30.555 --> 01:07:38.824
SAM: Well, so no more healing. But we could fly
right up there and break that thing.

01:07:38.824 --> 01:07:42.190
MARISHA: Do we really not want to do any other
healing?

01:07:42.190 --> 01:07:49.467
LAURA: Pike can heal us, but we can't rest.
There's no time for a rest. No time for a Heroes'

01:07:49.467 --> 01:07:51.811
Feast. I bought those &lt;i&gt;fucking&lt;/i&gt; chalices.

01:07:51.811 --> 01:07:53.614
TALIESIN: Next time.

01:07:53.614 --> 01:07:55.773
MARISHA: Might still be useful.

01:07:55.773 --> 01:07:57.418
ASHLEY: How long does Heroes' Feast take?

01:07:57.418 --> 01:07:59.004
SAM: Like an hour or something.

01:07:59.004 --> 01:08:00.667
TALIESIN: It will hardly matter.

01:08:00.667 --> 01:08:02.468
ASHLEY: We can't just take an hour?

01:08:02.468 --> 01:08:06.255
LAURA: I think that thing is like, going to go.

01:08:06.255 --> 01:08:11.790
MATT: It's up to you guys. It's a gradual. It's
not like all of a sudden, right now, you watched

01:08:11.790 --> 01:08:17.298
it pulse. As you've been getting towards, you've
been watching it slowly swell. So, who knows.

01:08:17.298 --> 01:08:22.150
SAM: Some of us could get on Mr. Mistoffelees and
fly around the tower and see if there's a window

01:08:22.150 --> 01:08:23.853
that we could bust in or something.

01:08:23.853 --> 01:08:28.553
LAURA: I wonder if Delilah's on the top of the
tower.

01:08:28.553 --> 01:08:31.962
SAM: Yeah, but we'll be on a thing, so maybe we
won't be very conspicuous.

01:08:31.962 --> 01:08:36.074
TALIESIN: Actually, maybe if we ask Mr.
Mistoffelees-- I'm going to never get tired of

01:08:36.074 --> 01:08:40.791
saying that!-- to go up to the tower, greet
whoever's up there, and throw them off.

01:08:40.791 --> 01:08:43.962
SAM: It's just a pulsing orb of doom, isn't it?

01:08:43.962 --> 01:08:47.808
TALIESIN: Just go up there and cause havoc.

01:08:47.808 --> 01:08:50.765
SAM: One of us needs to see what's up there.

01:08:50.765 --> 01:08:54.661
TALIESIN: No, we can just send him up there, and
then we can head in through the tower. He can just

01:08:54.661 --> 01:08:55.952
be a problem.

01:08:55.952 --> 01:09:01.210
SAM: He's dumb! What if comes back and he's like
'I don't know!'?

01:09:01.210 --> 01:09:05.077
TALIESIN: Just say, go up there and if there's
anything living up there, throw it off.

01:09:05.077 --> 01:09:10.922
SAM: Can't one of us go up there with him to scout
it out? Yeah, if someone's invisible. Can't you

01:09:10.922 --> 01:09:12.380
all be invisible?

01:09:12.380 --> 01:09:13.679
TALIESIN: Yes, all of us.

01:09:13.679 --> 01:09:14.611
SAM: Just me.

01:09:14.611 --> 01:09:16.260
TALIESIN: Yes, it's just you.

01:09:16.260 --> 01:09:17.657
LAURA: Can't you make all of us invisible?

01:09:17.657 --> 01:09:19.982
SAM: Not while I'm concentrating on Mr.
Mistoffelees!

01:09:19.982 --> 01:09:22.086
(laughter)

01:09:22.086 --> 01:09:29.322
TALIESIN: I say we head in closer on foot. If you
want to ride Mr. Mistoffelees up to the top of the

01:09:29.322 --> 01:09:31.364
tower, that's one thing. But I think just sending
him up there,

01:09:31.364 --> 01:09:33.407
or sending him to be an agent of chaos.

01:09:33.407 --> 01:09:37.807
LIAM: I could probably ride him, and if shit goes
south, I could get away.

01:09:37.807 --> 01:09:39.550
TALIESIN: You could always get swallowed.

01:09:39.550 --> 01:09:41.349
LIAM: By Mr. Mistoffelees?

01:09:41.349 --> 01:09:42.971
LAURA: By anything.

01:09:42.971 --> 01:09:46.356
TALIESIN: I get the distinct impression we're
going to have options before this day is over.

01:09:46.356 --> 01:09:52.993
MARISHA: I feel like we're going to have to do a
lot of things to stop this.

01:09:52.993 --> 01:09:56.391
SAM: We need to get into the tower! We don't even
know how to do that!

01:09:56.391 --> 01:10:00.875
LIAM: We don't know what we're talking about,
which is why I think the idea to go scope it out

01:10:00.875 --> 01:10:02.150
is a good one.

01:10:02.150 --> 01:10:06.313
LAURA: Does it look like there's any windows on
the tower, or is just a big old Rapunzel tower?

01:10:06.313 --> 01:10:07.655
MATT: Make a perception check.

01:10:07.655 --> 01:10:09.598
LAURA: Okay.

01:10:09.598 --> 01:10:11.092
SAM: Nope!

01:10:11.092 --> 01:10:12.652
LAURA: Well, hold on. 19.

01:10:12.652 --> 01:10:20.562
MATT: 19, still pretty good. Not a single window.
It's a solid tower.

01:10:20.562 --> 01:10:23.013
ASHLEY: Are there any doors? No windows?

01:10:23.013 --> 01:10:28.500
MATT: You can't tell from your perspective right
now. The base is currently obscured by the very,

01:10:28.500 --> 01:10:29.861
very dense buildings.

01:10:29.861 --> 01:10:31.452
LAURA: Ultimate challenge for Vox Machina.

01:10:31.452 --> 01:10:34.586
TRAVIS: Should we check one of the buildings, and
then we can figure out who wants to go check it

01:10:34.586 --> 01:10:36.567
out, so we can get out of the open?

01:10:36.567 --> 01:10:38.304
LAURA: Yeah, let's get in a building and hide!

01:10:38.304 --> 01:10:40.089
TRAVIS: Because he's a cleaner!

01:10:40.089 --> 01:10:45.554
LIAM: The tower, is it obscured by all this shit
happening on top of it? Vex can see there's no

01:10:45.554 --> 01:10:48.772
windows; can we see if there's a rooftop to it at
all?

01:10:48.772 --> 01:10:50.292
MATT: There is a top to the tower.

01:10:50.292 --> 01:10:53.151
LIAM: Is it this, is it this, or can we not see?

01:10:53.151 --> 01:11:00.260
MATT: The tower gently tapers and then comes to an
end. There is a top. You see there's three giant,

01:11:00.260 --> 01:11:08.709
curled finger-like black spires that curl inward
on the outside, inward. And then there's the

01:11:08.709 --> 01:11:14.029
platform where the tower stops, where it seems
like there would be somewhere to stand.

01:11:14.029 --> 01:11:17.566
LAURA: The thing that's glowing is off of the
ground of the tower?

01:11:17.566 --> 01:11:20.797
MATT: It's filling up the entirety of that space
between the fingers

01:11:20.797 --> 01:11:22.782
on the actual roof of the tower.

01:11:22.782 --> 01:11:27.160
MARISHA: What if it has to keep expanding all the
way to the crystals?

01:11:27.160 --> 01:11:36.576
TRAVIS: What's the nearest building? Is there one
building that's closest to

01:11:36.576 --> 01:11:38.207
where we came through the tunnel?

01:11:38.207 --> 01:11:40.157
MATT: Yeah, you guys are about ten feet from the
nearest building.

01:11:40.157 --> 01:11:41.681
TRAVIS: Can I walk over? Are there any windows?

01:11:41.681 --> 01:11:44.025
MATT: This building does not have any windows.

01:11:44.025 --> 01:11:45.172
TRAVIS: Does it have a door?

01:11:45.172 --> 01:11:46.199
MATT: It does.

01:11:46.199 --> 01:11:47.409
TRAVIS: Can I knock?

01:11:47.409 --> 01:12:00.374
MATT: (knocking) You watch as an older gentleman
with a very thin gray goatee, looks a little

01:12:00.374 --> 01:12:05.402
sallow, missing his left eye, he currently has a
small sack over his shoulder, he opens the door.

01:12:05.402 --> 01:12:06.874
"Can I--"

01:12:06.874 --> 01:12:08.504
TRAVIS: Hey, come here! And I grab his face.

01:12:08.504 --> 01:12:11.303
MATT: (muffled yelling)

01:12:11.303 --> 01:12:12.368
LAURA: Inside! Inside!

01:12:12.368 --> 01:12:13.940
TRAVIS: We just go in. Push in.

01:12:13.940 --> 01:12:15.247
TALIESIN: Well, we're going in now, aren't we?

01:12:15.247 --> 01:12:17.262
LIAM: And we're walking, and we're walking.

01:12:17.262 --> 01:12:25.062
SAM: I'll tell Mr. Mistoffelees to do a 90-second
loop and come back down and check in on us because

01:12:25.062 --> 01:12:26.716
he can't fit in the door, right?

01:12:26.716 --> 01:12:27.723
MATT: No!

01:12:27.723 --> 01:12:29.592
SAM: Fly around 90 seconds and swoop back down.

01:12:29.592 --> 01:12:38.867
MATT: He does a small circle as you guys all rush
into the building. You enter the inside. You see

01:12:38.867 --> 01:12:45.818
what looks to be a lot of building materials. It
looks like some of the outer buildings here were

01:12:45.818 --> 01:12:52.174
used as the storage facilities for what a lot of
the city was rebuilt as. There's nobody else

01:12:52.174 --> 01:12:56.889
inside right now. This gentleman looks like he was
on his way out of the building as you interrupted

01:12:56.889 --> 01:13:07.255
him. As now most of his head is just clasped by
your giant goliath Titanstone Knuckle-adorned

01:13:07.255 --> 01:13:13.794
hand, you see a little bit of his eye peeking over
Grog's, and he's like (muffled yelling).

01:13:13.794 --> 01:13:15.514
TRAVIS: Shh.

01:13:15.514 --> 01:13:20.215
MATT: You see he's got the heavy male pattern--
looks like the old D&amp;D Dungeon Master from the

01:13:20.215 --> 01:13:25.783
cartoon. He's bald on top, has long gray hair that
goes past his shoulders. Very thin, missing the

01:13:25.783 --> 01:13:30.983
left eye, and he's just limp. He's not even going to
fight it.

01:13:30.983 --> 01:13:35.545
LAURA: Oh hey! We were sent here by Delilah
Briarwood. You may know her.

01:13:35.545 --> 01:13:37.553
MATT: (muffled yelling)

01:13:37.553 --> 01:13:41.093
LAURA: Right. The ritual that's happening
on top of the tower. How long until that

01:13:41.093 --> 01:13:42.252
thing's done?

01:13:42.252 --> 01:13:44.085
MATT: (muffled noises)

01:13:44.085 --> 01:13:50.767
LAURA: Blink once for 15 minutes. Blink twice for
an hour or more.

01:13:50.767 --> 01:13:54.679
LIAM: Three times for a bunch of days.

01:13:54.679 --> 01:13:56.052
SAM: Maybe he doesn't know.

01:13:56.052 --> 01:13:59.109
LAURA: Yeah, do you know? Blink once for yes,
blink twice for no.

01:13:59.109 --> 01:14:01.259
MATT: (muffling noises)

01:14:01.259 --> 01:14:02.921
SAM: 15 minutes! No, that was once for 15
minutes!

01:14:02.921 --> 01:14:04.708
LAURA: No, that was an hour, at least!

01:14:04.708 --> 01:14:09.506
MARISHA: I thought he blinked before. Are we at an
hour and 15 minutes?

01:14:09.506 --> 01:14:11.680
TALIESIN: I don't think you can call it a blink if
you've got one eye.

01:14:11.680 --> 01:14:13.532
I think it's just a wink.

01:14:13.532 --> 01:14:15.700
MARISHA: A wink? Man, semantics!

01:14:15.700 --> 01:14:24.011
MATT: You get the sense that, as you say that, it
does hurt him a little. His demeanor, while

01:14:24.011 --> 01:14:27.255
already pretty shattered, just even further (sad
noise).

01:14:27.255 --> 01:14:29.688
TRAVIS: Does he have any pouches on him, or
anything in his hands?

01:14:29.688 --> 01:14:34.610
MATT: He had a small sack over his shoulder that
he was leaving with.

01:14:34.610 --> 01:14:36.777
He's just adorned in regular--

01:14:36.777 --> 01:14:39.248
TRAVIS: Is the sack on the ground now or is it
still over his shoulder?

01:14:39.248 --> 01:14:44.097
MATT: No, it's currently on the ground. He dropped
it as soon as you rushed and pushed him.

01:14:44.097 --> 01:14:46.294
TRAVIS: I take the satchel, and I give it to Pike
and say: look in here.

01:14:46.294 --> 01:14:58.293
MATT: You glance inside. As soon as you grab it,
you hear the clanging of metal. You look inside

01:14:58.293 --> 01:15:05.985
and you can see what appear to be a handful of
dark metal shortswords, daggers, simple dried

01:15:05.985 --> 01:15:11.089
rations, and, in fact, as you glance inside the
room now, you can see a lot of the supplies here,

01:15:11.089 --> 01:15:16.990
aside from construction supplies, you see a
handful of weapons that are well-made,

01:15:16.990 --> 01:15:19.117
recent-made, not seen battle yet.

01:15:19.117 --> 01:15:22.468
SAM: They're about to invade.

01:15:22.468 --> 01:15:24.809
LAURA: What if we burn the fucking city down?

01:15:24.809 --> 01:15:27.557
SAM: I mean, sure! What?

01:15:27.557 --> 01:15:32.138
LAURA: I mean, if they're planning on transporting
this whole fucking city, and setting an army loose

01:15:32.138 --> 01:15:38.003
on our world, why don't we just burn the whole
fucking city down? Destroy their rations. Destroy

01:15:38.003 --> 01:15:39.068
their weapons!

01:15:39.068 --> 01:15:40.416
TALIESIN: I am excited by this plan.

01:15:40.416 --> 01:15:43.441
SAM: Wait, what? No! That's terrible!

01:15:43.441 --> 01:15:45.577
LIAM: Let's burn down Manhattan. How do you do
that?!

01:15:45.577 --> 01:15:51.392
TRAVIS: Shall we ask this gentleman some
questions? All right. I'm going to remove my hand.

01:15:51.392 --> 01:15:58.096
Obviously, you're like really cool with the
purpose-- perspective of dying, and I'll quicken

01:15:58.096 --> 01:16:05.844
that if you make a loud noise. Right, like, if
you've ever seen, like, Jello mixed with, like

01:16:05.844 --> 01:16:09.599
apple pudding. That's what I'll do to your head.

01:16:09.599 --> 01:16:11.629
MATT: Make an intimidation check.

01:16:11.629 --> 01:16:14.941
LAURA: You did your hand signal for Arnold
Palmer.

01:16:14.941 --> 01:16:16.473
TRAVIS: I did!

01:16:16.473 --> 01:16:18.424
MATT: Universal.

01:16:18.424 --> 01:16:20.369
LAURA: Arnold Palmer?

01:16:20.369 --> 01:16:22.862
TRAVIS: 22!

01:16:22.862 --> 01:16:36.216
MATT: 22. He doesn't make a sound, more than the
gentle trickle out of his pant leg does. (laughs)

01:16:36.216 --> 01:16:37.860
TALIESIN: I think that's a yes.

01:16:37.860 --> 01:16:40.011
TRAVIS: Grab the scruff of his collar.

01:16:40.011 --> 01:16:48.096
MATT: Okay, as you release, he (gasps). His teeth
are broken and yellow, his one gaping socket is

01:16:48.096 --> 01:16:53.435
twitching a little bit from the recovery of the
sudden, rapid series of events that he was not

01:16:53.435 --> 01:16:58.616
expecting today. As he gathers his breath, and
scratches the side of his leg,

01:16:58.616 --> 01:17:04.417
"So. What do you wish to do to me?"

01:17:04.417 --> 01:17:08.378
SAM: Nothing! We've got to hurry!

01:17:08.378 --> 01:17:10.825
LAURA: No, really, do you know anything about the
ritual?

01:17:10.825 --> 01:17:13.622
MATT: "I mean, not the specifics."

01:17:13.622 --> 01:17:16.771
LAURA: Do you know if it's going to be over soon?

01:17:16.771 --> 01:17:23.727
MATT: "I know that some of the acolytes were
rushing through, expediting things recently."

01:17:23.727 --> 01:17:26.043
MARISHA: Why?

01:17:26.043 --> 01:17:27.711
MATT: "I don't know!"

01:17:27.711 --> 01:17:30.005
SAM: Did they tell you to gather weapons?

01:17:30.005 --> 01:17:31.789
MATT: "They just told us to be ready."

01:17:31.789 --> 01:17:38.845
LIAM: For what? What's the plan here, man? You're really far
away from anything fucking nice.

01:17:38.845 --> 01:17:43.492
MATT: You watch him close off as you start saying
that. He catches himself saying too much

01:17:43.492 --> 01:17:46.019
information. His demeanor goes cold.

01:17:46.019 --> 01:17:48.889
LAURA: Please, we know you're going to transport
to another plane.

01:17:48.889 --> 01:17:53.599
MARISHA: You're trying to bail, aren't you? Were
you trying to run?

01:17:53.599 --> 01:17:55.874
SAM: No, he's joining the fight.

01:17:55.874 --> 01:17:59.092
LAURA: Oh my god, he was going to leave.

01:17:59.092 --> 01:18:05.432
TRAVIS: Well, he's clearly clamming up. I put my
hand back over the front of his face, I take the

01:18:05.432 --> 01:18:09.334
other one, put it on the back of his face, and I
start making my fingers touch.

01:18:09.334 --> 01:18:20.213
MATT: (muffled groaning) He reaches up and grabs
the small symbol, familiar loop with the fork

01:18:20.213 --> 01:18:23.635
above it. He clasps it in his hand and doesn't
resist.

01:18:23.635 --> 01:18:30.325
TRAVIS: Do you want it?

01:18:30.325 --> 01:18:37.488
ASHLEY: Yeah! Put him a little lower, Grog. I rip
off the necklace.

01:18:37.488 --> 01:18:40.530
MATT: He's like clasping it in his hand. Make a
strength check.

01:18:40.530 --> 01:18:42.194
TALIESIN: Drop it! Drop it!

01:18:42.194 --> 01:18:44.378
ASHLEY: Oh my god, we're so terrible!

01:18:44.378 --> 01:18:45.737
TRAVIS: Are we?

01:18:45.737 --> 01:18:48.360
ASHLEY: Natural 20!

01:18:48.360 --> 01:18:56.138
MATT: He's clasping it, and you can see his one
eye rolls back to hold onto it and he's muttering

01:18:56.138 --> 01:19:01.459
a prayer beneath your fingers and he's (muffled
muttering) and you tear it from his grasp.

01:19:01.459 --> 01:19:03.798
(muffled panic)

01:19:03.798 --> 01:19:08.920
ASHLEY: We'll give it back! You've got to answer
some questions for us.

01:19:08.920 --> 01:19:12.268
TRAVIS: No, he won't. Look away if you want to
preserve anything, and I just squish his head.

01:19:12.268 --> 01:19:20.946
MATT: As you're saying that, you watch as one eye
opens and his hands go limp and then

01:19:20.946 --> 01:19:23.858
(face exploding) and it just (splattering).

01:19:23.858 --> 01:19:25.101
ASHLEY: &lt;i&gt;Grog&lt;/i&gt;!

01:19:25.101 --> 01:19:27.310
MATT: Spray on Pike.

01:19:27.310 --> 01:19:31.446
TRAVIS: I thought you were me giving the signal
like, end it!

01:19:31.446 --> 01:19:36.308
ASHLEY: No! I was going to-- whatever.

01:19:36.308 --> 01:19:38.762
TRAVIS: All right. We'll work on it.

01:19:38.762 --> 01:19:40.416
ASHLEY: We'll find another one. It's okay.

01:19:40.416 --> 01:19:43.509
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'm really sorry. Sorry.

01:19:43.509 --> 01:19:45.063
ASHLEY: Brains!

01:19:45.063 --> 01:19:46.716
LIAM: Pike got Dragon Aged.

01:19:46.716 --> 01:19:48.635
MATT: Yeah!

01:19:48.635 --> 01:19:51.152
MARISHA: Is there a water bucket around?

01:19:51.152 --> 01:19:55.153
MATT: Make an investigation check.

01:19:55.153 --> 01:19:59.817
LAURA: So, but, set fire to the house, right? Burn
the whole city down?

01:19:59.817 --> 01:20:01.159
SAM: No!

01:20:01.159 --> 01:20:02.849
MARISHA: 11.

01:20:02.849 --> 01:20:04.969
TALIESIN: The city is mostly stone; I don't know
if we can burn it down.

01:20:04.969 --> 01:20:08.332
MATT: As you're having this conversation, you do find a small
basin that's filled up with water. The people that

01:20:08.332 --> 01:20:13.939
live in this city still need to live. It looks
like there are the means of feeding and drinking,

01:20:14.014 --> 01:20:19.039
though you get the sense that they may or may
not-- most of the supplies do come from outside

01:20:19.039 --> 01:20:20.543
the Shadowfell.

01:20:20.543 --> 01:20:22.608
LAURA: Let's poison the water supply!

01:20:22.608 --> 01:20:28.468
MARISHA: I take a little bit of the water and
control it and let Pike wash off a little bit.

01:20:28.468 --> 01:20:29.649
MATT: Okay.

01:20:29.649 --> 01:20:33.643
ASHLEY: I think I got a little in my mouth
(gagging).

01:20:33.643 --> 01:20:38.038
LIAM: Wait, there's a little bit of skull right
there. All right.

01:20:38.038 --> 01:20:41.047
TALIESIN: That's the little chunk where the joint
is. It's just this little bit, it just breaks

01:20:41.047 --> 01:20:43.057
naturally if you put pressure on that side.

01:20:43.057 --> 01:20:49.080
MATT: There's this slumped pile of dark cloth,
thin body, and Riki-Oh mess on the ground.

01:20:49.080 --> 01:20:51.790
TALIESIN: (laughs) Wow! Way to bring that back!

01:20:51.790 --> 01:20:55.758
MATT: So, what's the plan, guys?

01:20:55.758 --> 01:20:59.342
TALIESIN: We've got a little shadow creature
coming back around in a moment.

01:20:59.342 --> 01:21:02.769
SAM: Want to jump on and do a scouting pass?

01:21:02.769 --> 01:21:05.757
LIAM: Yeah.

01:21:05.757 --> 01:21:07.968
TALIESIN: You guys do the scout, we'll heal?

01:21:07.968 --> 01:21:09.856
ASHLEY: You guys, are we not going to do a Heroes'
Feast?

01:21:09.856 --> 01:21:12.723
LAURA: It's an hour. It takes an hour, right?

01:21:12.723 --> 01:21:14.195
SAM: We can't risk it.

01:21:14.195 --> 01:21:18.193
LIAM: What do you think's going to happen in an
hour? Everything's going to kick off in an hour?

01:21:18.193 --> 01:21:21.051
SAM: Wouldn't you hate to miss it by 15 minutes?

01:21:21.051 --> 01:21:26.898
LAURA: The pulse has gotten stronger since we've
been here. I don't know if that pulse means it's

01:21:26.898 --> 01:21:29.759
about to go, or if the pulse means that it's five
minutes in.

01:21:29.759 --> 01:21:32.805
SAM: This guy was about to leave his house to go
walk over there for the final part of the ritual.

01:21:32.805 --> 01:21:36.093
MARISHA: Or he was trying to bail before the final
part of the ritual.

01:21:36.093 --> 01:21:39.140
LIAM: Where's your pet? Let's go find
some shit out.

01:21:39.140 --> 01:21:41.358
MARISHA: He had rations! No one takes rations!

01:21:41.410 --> 01:21:45.891
LAURA: He was handing out weapons.

01:21:45.891 --> 01:21:48.459
TALIESIN: It was like Carpentry of the Damned sort
of thing.

01:21:48.459 --> 01:21:51.937
MARISHA: What if the giant orb has to reach the
crystals?

01:21:51.937 --> 01:21:55.562
TALIESIN: It might, but it might just do the
(buzzing, exploding).

01:21:55.562 --> 01:21:58.329
LAURA: Technical terms.

01:21:58.329 --> 01:22:00.567
MARISHA: Yeah, the (buzzing, exploding).

01:22:00.567 --> 01:22:02.100
TALIESIN: It's magic, it's the best I've got.

01:22:02.100 --> 01:22:03.313
TRAVIS: Who's going up?

01:22:03.313 --> 01:22:05.753
SAM: Me and Vax.

01:22:05.753 --> 01:22:08.410
TRAVIS: Just you two, okay.

01:22:08.410 --> 01:22:10.886
ASHLEY: How's everybody doing right now?

01:22:10.962 --> 01:22:13.446
TALIESIN and MARISHA: I'm a little rough.

01:22:13.446 --> 01:22:15.448
TALIESIN: I could use 20 points.

01:22:15.448 --> 01:22:17.196
LAURA: Yeah, I could use 20 points.

01:22:17.196 --> 01:22:20.175
ASHLEY: Let's do a little Mass Cure Wounds
situation.

01:22:20.175 --> 01:22:21.466
MARISHA: Nice.

01:22:21.466 --> 01:22:26.982
TRAVIS: Do it!

01:22:26.982 --> 01:22:31.564
SAM: But do it with a flair!

01:22:31.564 --> 01:22:34.962
(laughter)

01:22:34.962 --> 01:22:37.693
ASHLEY: Oh, fudge.

01:22:37.693 --> 01:22:42.722
LAURA: What? Oh that's a one, not seven, isn't
it?

01:22:42.722 --> 01:22:45.012
ASHLEY: 13.

01:22:45.012 --> 01:22:47.067
LAURA: That's fine, that's fine!

01:22:47.067 --> 01:22:50.392
TALIESIN: We're taking a short rest; I can add
my--

01:22:50.392 --> 01:22:52.676
MATT: Are you guys taking a short rest?

01:22:52.676 --> 01:22:55.536
LAURA: Well, while they fly up, is it enough time
for the people staying

01:22:55.536 --> 01:22:57.080
in the house to heal a bit?

01:22:57.080 --> 01:23:02.050
MATT: You guys could take a short rest during that
time, if you want to do a full scoping. By the

01:23:02.050 --> 01:23:04.078
time you come back, that spell's about to fade.

01:23:04.078 --> 01:23:08.048
SAM: I mean, yeah, we're going to go as fast as we
can.

01:23:08.048 --> 01:23:11.035
MATT: So those that are traveling can't take a
short rest.

01:23:11.035 --> 01:23:15.305
TRAVIS: And if that fades, he's fully aware that
he was dominated, right?

01:23:15.305 --> 01:23:20.593
MATT: Well. You don't know.

01:23:20.593 --> 01:23:22.950
TRAVIS: Okay. Especially me.

01:23:22.950 --> 01:23:24.910
MATT: Yeah, you especially don't know.

01:23:24.910 --> 01:23:27.091
LIAM: Time's a-wasting, Scanlan, let's go.

01:23:27.091 --> 01:23:29.108
SAM: Let's go. Mr. Mistoffelees!

01:23:29.108 --> 01:23:42.292
MATT: As you open the door, there, just landing
(landing) (gloom stalker croaking). You guys climb

01:23:42.292 --> 01:23:43.316
onto its back?

01:23:43.316 --> 01:23:44.317
SAM: Yes, we do!

01:23:44.317 --> 01:23:48.291
MATT: You climb onto its back. Touching this
creature is like touching the inside of a freezer.

01:23:48.291 --> 01:23:53.914
Even with gauntleted hands, you have to wrap some
of your cloth around to not give yourself

01:23:53.914 --> 01:23:59.700
frostbite over a period of time. Even resting on
it, especially with your leather armors, it chills

01:23:59.700 --> 01:24:05.182
you to the bone. As you take up, and even just
ten, 15 minutes into (wings flapping) up into the

01:24:05.182 --> 01:24:09.717
air, gathering as to whether you'll be noticed or
spotted by this, you can feel it beginning to

01:24:09.717 --> 01:24:13.794
chill you, your teeth are beginning to chatter
from being in that proximity of the freezing cold

01:24:13.794 --> 01:24:21.576
creature. It's strange, as you touch it, it feels
less like fur and flesh and more like you're

01:24:21.576 --> 01:24:29.956
grabbing onto a very, very thick sackcloth. Like,
it tugs and pulls and it feels almost like the

01:24:29.956 --> 01:24:37.696
scruff of a cat or dog's neck, but it has a clothy
texture, and as you grab it, you can feel the cold

01:24:37.696 --> 01:24:43.449
wisps of shadow and darkness obscure your hands.
You feel like you're plunging your arms into it,

01:24:43.449 --> 01:24:46.878
but you find purchase within that shadow and hold
on.

01:24:46.878 --> 01:24:50.391
SAM: We'll need to spoon for warmth.

01:24:50.391 --> 01:24:53.458
LIAM: I nestle in behind Scanlan.

01:24:53.458 --> 01:24:55.601
SAM: I gladly accept.

01:24:55.601 --> 01:24:58.265
LIAM: Let's ride.

01:24:58.265 --> 01:25:00.733
TRAVIS: Let's ride?!

01:25:00.733 --> 01:25:04.766
(laughing)

01:25:04.766 --> 01:25:11.440
MATT: All right, so, as you guys take up into the
sky, and you guys are taking your short rest,

01:25:11.440 --> 01:25:15.167
we're going to take a quick break on our end as
well. Use the restroom, get a snack.

01:25:15.167 --> 01:25:16.344
MARISHA: We're taking a break?

01:25:16.344 --> 01:25:23.986
MATT: We're taking a break here because it is
8:30. We are going to do another giveaway at the

01:25:23.986 --> 01:25:28.804
break here, a Wyrmwood giveaway. A fantastic
flamebox elder hero vault, which is some of the

01:25:28.804 --> 01:25:31.077
prettiest wood that they make.

01:25:31.077 --> 01:25:33.208
LIAM: Maybe the prettiest Wyrmwood box ever.

01:25:33.208 --> 01:25:35.796
LAURA: How come we didn't ever see those before;
is that a new wood?

01:25:35.796 --> 01:25:37.705
MATT: I don't know. But it's cool!

01:25:37.705 --> 01:25:40.115
LAURA: I want it!

01:25:40.115 --> 01:25:45.200
MATT: Hero vault for whoever the lucky winner is.
To be a part of that drawing, rush over to Twitch

01:25:45.200 --> 01:25:53.505
chat. Tonight's password is 'secrets,' plural.
S-E-C-R-E-T-S. So, when you're prompted, enter the

01:25:53.505 --> 01:25:56.883
word 'secrets' in Twitch chat to be part of this
giveaway and we'll come back and announce who it

01:25:56.883 --> 01:26:00.455
is after the break. We'll see you guys here in a
few minutes.

01:26:00.455 --> 01:43:28.012
[break]

01:43:28.012 --> 01:43:31.357
(laughter)

01:43:31.357 --> 01:43:34.272
MATT: Hello, everyone, and welcome back to
Critical Role.

01:43:34.272 --> 01:43:35.863
ASHLEY: My timing is bad.

01:43:35.863 --> 01:43:40.824
(laughter)

01:43:40.824 --> 01:43:42.995
MATT: We missed you, too, guys.

01:43:42.995 --> 01:43:45.370
TRAVIS: Oh my god.

01:43:45.370 --> 01:43:50.920
ASHLEY: I forget, and then I remember to do it,
and then we're already on the air.

01:43:50.920 --> 01:43:59.809
MATT: Indeed, we are. Welcome back, everybody.
First off, our winner of the hero case from our

01:43:59.809 --> 01:44:08.425
friends at Wyrmwood is Rory1177. Rory1177, you are
the winner for tonight. Congratulations. Denobo

01:44:08.425 --> 01:44:13.584
will contact you and get your information and have
that shipped off to you asap, so congratulations.

01:44:13.584 --> 01:44:25.990
All right, so as the rest of you are taking a
short rest, the two of you are making your way, as

01:44:25.990 --> 01:44:32.523
stealthily as you can, on the back of a gloom
stalker as it encircles the exterior of the Castle

01:44:32.523 --> 01:44:35.774
Entropis. First off, I would like you both to make
a stealth check.

01:44:35.774 --> 01:44:38.266
LIAM: I squeeze the gnome tighter.

01:44:38.266 --> 01:44:43.184
LAURA: Oh god. I think you're out of range, so you
don't get the plus ten anymore.

01:44:43.184 --> 01:44:45.348
LIAM: That's okayish.

01:44:45.348 --> 01:44:47.091
SAM: 21.

01:44:47.091 --> 01:44:48.835
TALIESIN: You have advantage, though, on
everything.

01:44:48.835 --> 01:44:50.226
SAM: He's fine.

01:44:50.226 --> 01:44:55.073
LIAM: 34. A low 34.

01:44:55.073 --> 01:45:02.836
MATT: Okay, so you guys begin to circle the
exterior of the tower, making a wide spiral along

01:45:02.836 --> 01:45:12.590
its exterior. You make your way up. It's hard to
gauge the full height of this tower, but it's at

01:45:12.590 --> 01:45:22.023
least six or seven stories tall, if not taller. I
want you both to make perception checks, please.

01:45:22.023 --> 01:45:25.727
LIAM: Now that we're closer, I'm looking for
windows that she might not have been close enough

01:45:25.727 --> 01:45:27.932
to see. Doors, holes, anything.

01:45:27.932 --> 01:45:29.300
MATT: Perception check.

01:45:29.300 --> 01:45:30.683
LIAM: Yes, sir.

01:45:30.683 --> 01:45:34.178
SAM: Natural one! I'm under his body.

01:45:34.178 --> 01:45:37.578
MATT: He's curled up within Vax.

01:45:37.578 --> 01:45:39.383
LIAM: Hey!

01:45:39.383 --> 01:45:43.601
MATT: Not even a top or bottom circumstance.
You're just within.

01:45:43.601 --> 01:45:47.376
LIAM: It really just depends on the day. 26.

01:45:47.376 --> 01:45:56.932
MATT: 26. Okay. No windows. It is a solid tower,
completely around as you cycle around. As you get

01:45:56.932 --> 01:46:04.954
towards the top of it, you notice the three curved
fingerlike spires that curl up at the top and the

01:46:04.954 --> 01:46:11.368
pulsing of the energy. You watch as these very
faint tendrils of magical energy that you've tuned

01:46:11.368 --> 01:46:16.685
in to be able to see better, now that you know what
to look for, are all-- from this height, you can

01:46:16.685 --> 01:46:23.681
see the long strands are undulating and shifting,
almost like the very winds of the land are causing

01:46:23.681 --> 01:46:28.794
them to rotate. You can see the variations in
their form, but they're all still merging and

01:46:28.794 --> 01:46:40.012
entwining at the very top of Entropis. You see
nothing. You can see what appear to be a cluster

01:46:40.012 --> 01:46:52.306
of about 30 or so figures all gathered along the
top of this. You can see what appear to be three

01:46:52.306 --> 01:46:59.501
glowing spheres in a triangular pattern around
this that are accepting the tether of the magical

01:46:59.501 --> 01:47:04.700
energy, and then suffusing what appears to be a
small altar of some kind in the very center of the

01:47:04.700 --> 01:47:06.571
top of this tower.

01:47:06.571 --> 01:47:09.696
LIAM: Mother bitch.

01:47:09.696 --> 01:47:20.238
MATT: You've been circling here for about 15 to 20
minutes or so, and the energy (explosion noise)

01:47:20.238 --> 01:47:28.849
untethers and unfurls. There's a shockwave of
warmth that cascades outward from the top of the

01:47:28.849 --> 01:47:32.659
tower. Both of you feel it pass through you, and
that freezing cold that you've been trying

01:47:32.659 --> 01:47:38.522
desperately to hold at bay as you're clutching
onto the back of this gloom stalker, this heat

01:47:38.522 --> 01:47:44.779
wave moves past. The gloom stalker (squawks)
instinctually pulls back, and you can see for a

01:47:44.779 --> 01:47:50.014
second it drops, and you feel your stomach bottom
out as it loses about 20 feet of elevation before

01:47:50.014 --> 01:47:53.730
catching itself again. And you watch as any of the
others that are currently cycling around

01:47:53.730 --> 01:48:00.321
the stratosphere over the city of Thar Amphala
also are taken off guard by the sudden burst of

01:48:00.321 --> 01:48:08.584
energy. As you glance over, you can see the
tethers that connect have all fallen and faded.

01:48:08.584 --> 01:48:11.222
(music changes)

01:48:11.222 --> 01:48:14.318
SAM: (quietly) How does he do that? How did you do
that?

01:48:14.318 --> 01:48:22.131
MATT: You also watch as about 25 or so of these
figures at the top all collapse at once.

01:48:22.131 --> 01:48:24.810
LIAM: But some are left.

01:48:24.810 --> 01:48:30.906
MATT: There are some left. You watch and very
faintly, you can see on that altar in the center,

01:48:30.906 --> 01:48:38.413
there is a small bead of pure, vibrant, bright
white light. You watch as a robed figure that

01:48:38.413 --> 01:48:45.787
previously was held in the shadows emerge. You're
too far away to make any more details than that.

01:48:45.787 --> 01:48:52.220
LIAM: A lot of motherfuckers just died on the top
of that tower. You felt that?

01:48:52.220 --> 01:48:55.576
SAM: What do we do? Is that the end of the
ritual?

01:48:55.576 --> 01:48:58.815
LIAM: How much time left on that hour, buddy?

01:48:58.815 --> 01:49:02.034
SAM: Enough to get back to our friends, probably.

01:49:02.034 --> 01:49:03.515
LIAM: We've got to go.

01:49:03.515 --> 01:49:07.515
SAM: Should we attack now? Just the two of us?

01:49:07.515 --> 01:49:10.313
LIAM: No, we should not do that.

01:49:10.313 --> 01:49:11.508
SAM: We could.

01:49:11.508 --> 01:49:12.464
LIAM: We could.

01:49:12.464 --> 01:49:15.701
SAM: Between you and me, we're the most powerful
ones in the group.

01:49:15.701 --> 01:49:19.227
LIAM: I just don't feel like freeballing it right
now, and I'd really like the group.

01:49:19.227 --> 01:49:23.258
SAM: I know, but will you at least confirm that
yes, we are the most powerful?

01:49:23.258 --> 01:49:30.024
LIAM: Clearly. We are the most, as the kids say,
OP. Let's get back to the group.

01:49:30.024 --> 01:49:35.468
SAM: All right. Hold me tight. Mr. Mistoffeles,
back down.

01:49:35.468 --> 01:49:41.749
MATT: It goes into a rapid dive, making its way
back towards where you left the rest of your

01:49:41.749 --> 01:49:47.513
party. The rest of you, you can go ahead and
regain your short rest. You get your Wild Shape

01:49:47.513 --> 01:49:51.780
back. You can spend any hit dice to heal up if
you'd like. If you haven't already.

01:49:51.780 --> 01:49:53.475
LAURA: I already did it.

01:49:53.475 --> 01:49:56.363
MATT: Okay, good. I also need all of you to roll a
wisdom saving throw, please.

01:49:56.363 --> 01:49:58.047
SAM: Everybody?

01:49:58.047 --> 01:50:00.095
MATT: Everybody who was on a short rest.

01:50:00.095 --> 01:50:08.821
LAURA: If we had had a Feast, we'd have advantage
on this.

01:50:08.821 --> 01:50:10.718
MARISHA: We would.

01:50:10.718 --> 01:50:13.310
MATT: All right, so.

01:50:13.310 --> 01:50:14.940
TALIESIN: 14.

01:50:14.940 --> 01:50:16.443
MARISHA: 30.

01:50:16.443 --> 01:50:18.332
LAURA: 24.

01:50:18.332 --> 01:50:22.966
ASHLEY: Just to make sure: I used Gnome Cunning,
because I get advantage on wisdom.

01:50:22.966 --> 01:50:26.304
MATT: It's not a "magical" effect.

01:50:26.304 --> 01:50:33.924
ASHLEY: Okay. So then I'll take my first roll,
which was two. And then I will add my wisdom

01:50:33.924 --> 01:50:36.435
saving throw number, which is ten, so I have 12.

01:50:36.435 --> 01:50:38.298
TRAVIS: 19.

01:50:38.298 --> 01:50:41.473
SAM: I want you to explain every roll.

01:50:41.473 --> 01:50:47.267
MATT: In the rest you take, the Shadowfell does
not seem to have

01:50:47.267 --> 01:50:49.778
any adverse effect on your presence.

01:50:49.778 --> 01:50:52.610
TALIESIN: However...

01:50:52.610 --> 01:51:00.322
MATT: There's no "however." You complete your rest
fine. You guys all gather your stuff, you take a

01:51:00.322 --> 01:51:05.268
breath and prepare for the next leg of your
venture as the door to your building slams open,

01:51:05.268 --> 01:51:10.646
Scanlan and Vax arriving, just leaping off the
back of the gloom stalker that they had under

01:51:10.646 --> 01:51:13.933
their control. Who is also about to lose its...

01:51:13.933 --> 01:51:15.692
TALIESIN: How much longer do they have?

01:51:15.692 --> 01:51:17.152
SAM: Fly away!

01:51:17.152 --> 01:51:19.836
TALIESIN: Attack the tower. Tell it to attack the
tower.

01:51:19.836 --> 01:51:22.281
SAM: Really? It's going to forget halfway there.

01:51:22.281 --> 01:51:24.972
TALIESIN: Maybe we can mess one person up.

01:51:24.972 --> 01:51:27.678
SAM: Fly away! Just fly away!

01:51:27.678 --> 01:51:34.203
ASHLEY: On the rest, could I have worked a little
bit more on enchanting the silver bullets?

01:51:34.203 --> 01:51:39.913
MATT: You can spend a little more time on it.
It'll take a few days of getting that to happen.

01:51:39.913 --> 01:51:41.474
ASHLEY: I just keep working on it.

01:51:41.474 --> 01:51:45.516
LAURA: Did we feel that (whoosh) within the
building?

01:51:45.516 --> 01:51:48.777
MATT: You didn't. You may have heard something
strange, but it didn't really catch your

01:51:48.777 --> 01:51:51.647
attention. You guys spent your time resting on the
inside of the building.

01:51:51.647 --> 01:51:53.127
LAURA: What'd you see?

01:51:53.127 --> 01:51:59.292
LIAM: Saw a lot of fucking people just die on the
top of that tower. I can't guarantee it, but I

01:51:59.292 --> 01:52:03.115
think it's a safe bet that your girl Delilah is up
there.

01:52:03.115 --> 01:52:05.416
LAURA: That's where I figured she'd be.

01:52:05.416 --> 01:52:10.645
SAM: It seems they've completed at least some part
of the ritual.

01:52:10.645 --> 01:52:16.209
LIAM: Yeah, there was some sort of massive pulse
of energy, 20-something hooded figures just

01:52:16.209 --> 01:52:19.772
dropped dead on the spot. A wave of some shit
blasted through us.

01:52:19.772 --> 01:52:22.281
LAURA: Can I run out and look at the tower and see
if the orb looks different?

01:52:22.281 --> 01:52:23.884
MARISHA: I join Vex.

01:52:23.884 --> 01:52:27.974
MATT: You guys rush out and peek outside of the
doorway towards the top of Entropis. You see that

01:52:27.974 --> 01:52:34.091
the glowing pulse is gone. The energy tethers from
the siphons are gone.

01:52:34.091 --> 01:52:36.272
LAURA: Fuck.

01:52:36.272 --> 01:52:39.597
MARISHA: I look around. Are we still in the
Shadowfell?

01:52:39.597 --> 01:52:44.515
MATT: Perception check.

01:52:44.515 --> 01:52:50.681
MARISHA: That's not great. 18.

01:52:50.681 --> 01:52:52.598
MATT: That's enough. Yeah, you're still in the
Shadowfell.

01:52:52.598 --> 01:52:53.967
(sounds of relief)

01:52:53.967 --> 01:52:55.827
TRAVIS: Motherfucking Mercer. That intonation.

01:52:55.827 --> 01:53:01.307
TALIESIN: If you rolled low enough, he'd be like,
"You don't know." Seattle!

01:53:01.307 --> 01:53:03.264
You've taken us to Seattle!

01:53:03.264 --> 01:53:08.239
LAURA: Well, we should fucking get up there, then,
huh?

01:53:08.239 --> 01:53:09.975
SAM: Should we go straight up the tower?

01:53:09.975 --> 01:53:11.509
LIAM: What else are we doing here?

01:53:11.509 --> 01:53:12.922
SAM: Yeah, all right.

01:53:12.922 --> 01:53:14.277
TALIESIN: Let's head to the base.

01:53:14.277 --> 01:53:18.778
SAM: But we're going to fight an aerial battle
against super-magical things.

01:53:18.778 --> 01:53:20.344
MARISHA: Oh my god.

01:53:20.344 --> 01:53:23.321
LIAM: We're weighing risk here. What do we think
would happen if

01:53:23.321 --> 01:53:25.815
we spent an hour having that Feast right now?

01:53:25.815 --> 01:53:28.017
TRAVIS: Actually, that's true. Nothing's going to
change at this point.

01:53:28.017 --> 01:53:29.271
SAM: Maybe.

01:53:29.271 --> 01:53:35.236
MARISHA: I mean, maybe we should return to
something like sabotaging the machine, or...

01:53:35.236 --> 01:53:40.485
burning the city. Oh god, Vex is rubbing off on
me.

01:53:40.485 --> 01:53:42.482
LAURA: Did you see Delilah up there?

01:53:42.482 --> 01:53:45.631
LIAM: No. There was a ringleader, but we were too
far out.

01:53:45.631 --> 01:53:48.288
LAURA: And the ringleader was still standing?

01:53:48.288 --> 01:53:49.415
LIAM: Yeah.

01:53:49.415 --> 01:53:51.228
ASHLEY: How many people were still standing?

01:53:51.228 --> 01:53:53.471
MATT: That would have been three that you
noticed.

01:53:53.471 --> 01:53:54.911
LIAM: Precisely three.

01:53:54.911 --> 01:53:56.815
(laughter)

01:53:56.815 --> 01:54:01.470
ASHLEY: Lots of them died in the blast?

01:54:01.470 --> 01:54:03.634
SAM: Yeah, so it's not even going to be a tough
fight. We'll just

01:54:03.634 --> 01:54:05.773
take down three people and be done, right?

01:54:05.773 --> 01:54:07.016
LAURA: So easy.

01:54:07.016 --> 01:54:09.863
TALIESIN: The less people we're fighting, the
worse it is.

01:54:09.863 --> 01:54:10.989
MARISHA: Agreed.

01:54:10.989 --> 01:54:12.687
ASHLEY: It won't just be three.

01:54:12.687 --> 01:54:14.541
TALIESIN: It might be four.

01:54:14.541 --> 01:54:16.512
SAM: It'll be... less than three?

01:54:16.512 --> 01:54:22.218
LAURA: Even one with that fucking wall she had
last time, we're fucked.

01:54:22.218 --> 01:54:26.543
MARISHA: How far did the blast go that you saw?

01:54:26.543 --> 01:54:28.586
LIAM: We were 100 yards out or something?

01:54:28.586 --> 01:54:31.869
MATT: Yeah, you were probably about 300 feet out.

01:54:31.869 --> 01:54:38.225
LAURA: We didn't do any research on that wall, did
we? That spell? Did anybody do any research on

01:54:38.225 --> 01:54:41.018
that spell that we saw her do? Down in the
ziggurat?

01:54:41.018 --> 01:54:43.977
TALIESIN: We kind of figured out what it was. It
was a modified version

01:54:43.977 --> 01:54:45.635
of a spell we've seen before.

01:54:45.635 --> 01:54:50.424
MATT: Kind of, yeah. It seemed to be prismatic.
You've seen Prismatic Spray. It's a prismatic

01:54:50.424 --> 01:54:56.614
spell in nature but you didn't really research any
means of defeating it or bypassing it.

01:54:56.614 --> 01:54:59.181
TRAVIS: Do you still have that Earthquake spell?

01:54:59.181 --> 01:55:02.065
MARISHA: I believe me and Pike both do, yes.

01:55:02.065 --> 01:55:06.235
TRAVIS: We couldn't, like, earthquake the tower to the
ground. Could we?

01:55:06.286 --> 01:55:10.155
MARISHA: Between me, you, and Pike? We can take
this tower down.

01:55:10.155 --> 01:55:11.471
SAM: Is that true?

01:55:11.471 --> 01:55:14.094
TRAVIS: I just don't know about us going to the
top, if we could maybe bring it--

01:55:14.094 --> 01:55:16.138
TALIESIN: Oh, if we could maybe bring the top down
here?

01:55:16.138 --> 01:55:21.154
SAM: That's a good idea, if you can really do it.

01:55:21.154 --> 01:55:22.930
TRAVIS: I just don't know how big around it is. It
might be fucking huge.

01:55:22.930 --> 01:55:24.705
TALIESIN: How big around is the tower?

01:55:24.705 --> 01:55:26.896
MATT: At the very base--

01:55:26.896 --> 01:55:35.344
TALIESIN: He's looking at the tower.

01:55:35.344 --> 01:55:44.545
MATT: -- it's about 170, 180 feet in diameter.

01:55:44.545 --> 01:55:56.093
MARISHA: Hang on, 180 feet in diameter? Hang on.
Pike and I check our spellbooks real quick.

01:55:56.093 --> 01:56:00.653
TALIESIN: Can I do a little engineering? If I were
going to punch at it...

01:56:00.653 --> 01:56:06.893
LIAM: Also, the idea that we're going to sneak
into that tower is farfetched.

01:56:06.893 --> 01:56:09.883
SAM: No, we either have to fly up to the top or
bring it down to us, right?

01:56:09.883 --> 01:56:11.564
LAURA: I like the idea of bringing it down.

01:56:11.564 --> 01:56:15.803
LIAM: Even if it fails, the fight will still come
to-- Either we bring the fight to them, or we rip

01:56:15.803 --> 01:56:17.652
down the tower and bring the fight to us.

01:56:17.652 --> 01:56:21.062
MARISHA: For up to a minute and a hundred foot
radius, centered at a point...

01:56:21.062 --> 01:56:25.696
MATT: It deals 50 bludgeoning damage to any
structure in contact with the ground in the area

01:56:25.696 --> 01:56:29.303
when you cast the spell. If it drops to zero hit
points, it collapses and potentially damages

01:56:29.303 --> 01:56:35.756
nearby creatures. So the question is, do you think
that'll be enough to drop a solid obsidian tower?

01:56:35.756 --> 01:56:39.296
LAURA: It's a tough call. Twice in a row?

01:56:39.296 --> 01:56:42.201
MARISHA: But, I mean, two Earthquake spells and
Grog.

01:56:42.201 --> 01:56:44.908
LAURA: I have a siege arrow.

01:56:44.908 --> 01:56:50.263
MARISHA: I will point out this will be burning
mine and Pike's 8th-level spell,

01:56:50.263 --> 01:56:52.714
but it might be worth it.

01:56:52.714 --> 01:57:00.833
SAM: It feels like it's a 3.2 earthquake, we need
a 6.2 earthquake.

01:57:00.833 --> 01:57:05.891
TRAVIS: That's true, we do. Let's be honest. We
really do need a massive shake.

01:57:05.891 --> 01:57:09.257
LAURA: What if we weaken the outside and then hit
with the earthquake?

01:57:09.257 --> 01:57:11.395
MARISHA: I can tunnel out underneath it.

01:57:11.395 --> 01:57:18.337
TALIESIN: I think whatever was going on up there is
gone. I think it's happened.

01:57:18.337 --> 01:57:22.365
LAURA: Well, Delilah's still up there, so if she
falls at least she takes some damage.

01:57:22.365 --> 01:57:24.136
TALIESIN: That's fair.

01:57:24.136 --> 01:57:33.727
LIAM: I'm just going to throw my vote in the ring
here, that I think we should take the time for the

01:57:33.727 --> 01:57:41.180
Feast. You know, we're not killing piles of rats
in the sewers, here. This is serious.

01:57:41.180 --> 01:57:46.947
SAM: When last time we fought Delilah, were any of
us scared of her?

01:57:46.947 --> 01:57:49.618
TALIESIN: She's not what I'm afraid of.

01:57:49.618 --> 01:57:54.307
LAURA: Wisdom saving throws are major. She could
take control of us.

01:57:54.307 --> 01:58:01.102
TRAVIS: I'm not against that, but I think one
person should stay out of the Feast and keep an

01:58:01.102 --> 01:58:04.496
eye in case they leave in the hour that we're
feasting.

01:58:04.496 --> 01:58:07.918
SAM: Well, if someone's going to stay out of the
Feast, it should be the guy who already has

01:58:07.918 --> 01:58:09.257
advantage on everything.

01:58:09.257 --> 01:58:12.058
TRAVIS: Oh, that too, yeah. I just can't get
afraid, that's all I was going to say.

01:58:12.058 --> 01:58:14.848
LAURA: Yeah, but you can be taken control of with
your brain, Grog.

01:58:14.848 --> 01:58:16.857
TRAVIS: That's assuming a lot.

01:58:16.857 --> 01:58:19.867
TALIESIN: Damn it.

01:58:19.867 --> 01:58:21.538
ASHLEY: Shit.

01:58:21.538 --> 01:58:25.095
TRAVIS: Or we just go get it. We just go after it
and go get it.

01:58:25.095 --> 01:58:28.818
SAM: I'm against the Feast. I think we should just
run in.

01:58:28.818 --> 01:58:31.536
LAURA: I just don't feel like there's time,
honestly.

01:58:31.536 --> 01:58:35.344
SAM: Also, I'm vegan, I don't know if I could eat
everything at the feast.

01:58:35.344 --> 01:58:40.260
LIAM: It is largely GoFiBePo?

01:58:40.260 --> 01:58:47.572
SAM: GoFiBePo? Why didn't you just name it a Poobah
Platter?

01:58:47.572 --> 01:58:49.917
LAURA: Oh, that would have been way easier.

01:58:49.917 --> 01:58:53.941
MARISHA: How far are we from the tower in this
little house?

01:58:53.941 --> 01:59:00.854
MATT: In this house, you're a little over a half
mile away from it.

01:59:00.854 --> 01:59:05.081
TALIESIN: It's a ten-minute walk.

01:59:05.081 --> 01:59:07.974
MATT: So this house is just outside of the
perimeter wall of the inner cloister.

01:59:07.974 --> 01:59:12.759
MARISHA: You guys could do the Feast and some of
us can help tunnel out

01:59:12.759 --> 01:59:14.866
the ground during that hour.

01:59:14.866 --> 01:59:21.092
TALIESIN: I don't know. I don't think we're going
to bring it down.

01:59:21.092 --> 01:59:23.354
GROG: I don't know if we're going to bring it
down. It was a cool idea, but I don't know if we're

01:59:23.354 --> 01:59:25.718
going to do it. We're no white ancient dragon.

01:59:25.765 --> 01:59:27.330
ASHLEY: What's it made of? Obsidian?

01:59:27.330 --> 01:59:30.503
MATT: You haven't been close enough to really
tell, but it looks to be made of a very thick,

01:59:30.503 --> 01:59:34.051
dark obsidian or onyx-like material.

01:59:34.051 --> 01:59:36.372
LIAM: It's also unsettling as fuck, right?

01:59:36.372 --> 01:59:38.530
LAURA: Oh, it's probably magically protected.

01:59:38.530 --> 01:59:40.085
LIAM: Probably.

01:59:40.085 --> 01:59:42.372
TALIESIN: It may just hover there if we knock
this.

01:59:42.372 --> 01:59:44.271
LAURA: That is very true.

01:59:44.271 --> 01:59:47.773
TALIESIN: It may be keeping the ground up as
opposed to being sitting

01:59:47.773 --> 01:59:49.431
on the ground at that point.

01:59:49.431 --> 01:59:51.129
MARISHA: So we're going to try to fly up?

01:59:51.129 --> 01:59:52.373
TALIESIN: Or walk up through the inside.

01:59:52.373 --> 01:59:54.847
GROG: Raise your hand if you want a Heroes'
Feast.

01:59:54.847 --> 01:59:56.834
LIAM: For you all, yes.

01:59:56.834 --> 01:59:58.737
TRAVIS: Four?

01:59:58.737 --> 02:00:00.266
SAM: Is that a raise or not?

02:00:00.266 --> 02:00:01.677
TRAVIS: Are you scratching your ear or are you
raising your hand?

02:00:01.677 --> 02:00:03.937
TALIESIN: Yes, damn it.

02:00:03.937 --> 02:00:05.976
SAM: Wait, so, are we four?

02:00:05.976 --> 02:00:09.901
ASHLEY: I'm just nervous. I know we don't have
time, but what if this is one of those decisions

02:00:09.901 --> 02:00:12.270
where later we're like "We should have fucking
done a Heroes' Feast"?

02:00:12.270 --> 02:00:13.521
TRAVIS: Well, let's do it.

02:00:13.521 --> 02:00:17.018
ASHLEY: I don't know, though, I don't know if we
have the time. This is hard.

02:00:17.018 --> 02:00:20.379
TRAVIS: Well, the transaction upstairs has already
happened, whether they get away or not.

02:00:20.379 --> 02:00:22.969
MARISHA: I have a feeling we're going to be down
here a while.

02:00:22.969 --> 02:00:29.941
LAURA: Maybe we can prepare the Feast, keep an eye
out. If we have to ditch out on the Feast early,

02:00:29.941 --> 02:00:31.097
then we do.

02:00:31.097 --> 02:00:35.128
MARISHA: Keyleth looks out the window again. Are
people panicked, are people running around? Is

02:00:35.128 --> 02:00:36.745
there a rabble in the street?

02:00:36.745 --> 02:00:40.513
MATT: There's no technical window in this
building. There's the door.

02:00:40.513 --> 02:00:42.215
TRAVIS: She just pushes her head against the
wall.

02:00:42.215 --> 02:00:52.217
MATT: So you look out the door and glance through.
You do notice, there's no panic, but you do see a

02:00:52.217 --> 02:00:57.508
number of-- and this is interesting-- you glance
out, and you don't see any undead wandering the

02:00:57.508 --> 02:01:03.551
streets of the inner cloister. At least, not like
the outer area was. You do see-- make a perception

02:01:03.551 --> 02:01:07.062
check, actually.

02:01:07.062 --> 02:01:10.489
MARISHA: Oh, that's good! 30!

02:01:10.489 --> 02:01:15.206
MATT: You see, throughout the street, which, the
street from here gets about halfway to the tower

02:01:15.206 --> 02:01:23.870
before it hits a building and curves around. You
see maybe 35 or 40 total people in matching or

02:01:23.870 --> 02:01:28.381
close cultist robes or similar colors, all making
their way towards the tower.

02:01:28.381 --> 02:01:32.221
TALIESIN: They're dressed for an occasion. Fuck
it. Just go.

02:01:32.221 --> 02:01:35.963
LAURA: We got to go. 35 to 40 people? Let's kill
'em all on the way up.

02:01:35.963 --> 02:01:41.068
MARISHA: Man, you're frosty today. You're just--

02:01:41.068 --> 02:01:44.486
LAURA: They're trying to come over into our
territory. I don't like it. They're all assholes.

02:01:44.486 --> 02:01:46.037
TRAVIS: Shall we go in?

02:01:46.037 --> 02:01:48.623
MARISHA: Well, how are we going to go in, though?
Just flying up?

02:01:48.623 --> 02:01:51.894
TALIESIN: We have one broom, we don't have two
brooms anymore.

02:01:51.894 --> 02:01:54.896
We got a carpet, and we got wings.

02:01:54.896 --> 02:02:00.869
LAURA: And a couple people with wings. Oh god,
the creepy music is starting.

02:02:00.869 --> 02:02:03.603
We gotta go, y'all.

02:02:03.603 --> 02:02:04.865
LIAM: Beeline to the tower.

02:02:04.865 --> 02:02:08.061
MARISHA: And then what? And then what, though?
Once we get there? Play it by ear?

02:02:08.061 --> 02:02:13.769
TALIESIN: Throw everything off the top. Break
everything. Smash everything.

02:02:13.769 --> 02:02:18.541
LAURA: It's Delilah. She's going to destroy us. Do
we have any way to neutralize her magic?

02:02:18.541 --> 02:02:24.184
TRAVIS: Well, you could turn into a... no.

02:02:24.184 --> 02:02:31.238
MARISHA: I can't. I gave Vax Foresight. I cannot
turn into a beholder today.

02:02:31.238 --> 02:02:32.605
SAM: I can.

02:02:32.605 --> 02:02:34.092
TALIESIN: You can?

02:02:34.092 --> 02:02:35.436
SAM: Yes.

02:02:35.436 --> 02:02:37.613
MARISHA: Do you have Shapechange?

02:02:37.613 --> 02:02:39.407
SAM: Something like it.

02:02:39.407 --> 02:02:41.438
(gasping)

02:02:41.438 --> 02:02:44.300
TALIESIN: All right, this is almost a plan. Let's
do this.

02:02:44.300 --> 02:02:45.658
TRAVIS: It's more than we normally have.

02:02:45.658 --> 02:02:47.186
TALIESIN: It's far more.

02:02:47.186 --> 02:02:49.760
LAURA: Are there a lot of gloom stalkers around?

02:02:49.760 --> 02:03:00.843
MATT: You can tell with the loss of magical energy
that they've been tossed askew a bit. Their

02:03:00.843 --> 02:03:05.630
patterns of circling and being intent, they're a
little more scattered a bit, but there are still

02:03:05.630 --> 02:03:11.057
maybe a few dozen that look over the inner
cloister.

02:03:11.057 --> 02:03:15.038
TALIESIN: Let's make our way to the tower and
maybe head up through the tower. We don't have to

02:03:15.038 --> 02:03:17.098
necessarily fly up to the top.

02:03:17.098 --> 02:03:25.862
LAURA: Wait a minute. Did the orb at the top turn
the same way that the orbs in the ziggurat turn?

02:03:25.862 --> 02:03:34.486
MATT: There were faint orbs that were taking the
energy and focusing it towards that center altar,

02:03:34.486 --> 02:03:40.808
and when everything faded after the shock wave,
what you saw looked like the tiniest star. It was

02:03:40.808 --> 02:03:46.619
just a speck of extremely bright light that to
look directly at it hurt.

02:03:46.619 --> 02:03:51.496
TRAVIS: I don't know! I don't! Just go get it.

02:03:51.496 --> 02:03:56.340
MARISHA: I'm honestly still kind of into the
earthquake idea. Bringing down the tower. I'm not

02:03:56.340 --> 02:03:57.355
going to lie.

02:03:57.355 --> 02:03:58.491
SAM: That's not going to work!

02:03:58.491 --> 02:03:59.546
MARISHA: How do you know?

02:03:59.546 --> 02:04:01.228
SAM: You said 50 points of damage?

02:04:01.228 --> 02:04:05.845
TALIESIN: I can take 50 points of damage. I can
take two earthquakes, personally.

02:04:05.845 --> 02:04:09.499
SAM: I mean, just from a metagaming scenario,
that's not even-- that can't even hurt--

02:04:09.499 --> 02:04:13.404
MARISHA: No, no, no. The tremor deals 50
bludgeoning damage to any structure in contact

02:04:13.404 --> 02:04:17.704
with the ground in your area when you cast the
spell, and at the start of each of your turns

02:04:17.704 --> 02:04:20.745
until the spell ends, and the spell lasts a
minute.

02:04:20.745 --> 02:04:23.050
SAM: So you get ten 50s.

02:04:23.050 --> 02:04:24.813
MARISHA: Ten of those. Ten 50s.

02:04:24.813 --> 02:04:26.236
LAURA: Oh, and then times two.

02:04:26.236 --> 02:04:27.793
MARISHA: With Pike and I.

02:04:27.793 --> 02:04:32.850
SAM: So that's 1000 points. Over a minute. That's
better than I thought.

02:04:32.850 --> 02:04:34.455
LIAM: Is it concentration?

02:04:34.455 --> 02:04:40.150
MARISHA: It's concentration for up to a minute,
and it has a 500-foot range, and a 100-foot

02:04:40.150 --> 02:04:45.062
radius. So Pike and I could split, half and half
of the tower.

02:04:45.062 --> 02:04:47.965
TRAVIS: It's pretty fucking Hollywood. I kind of
like it.

02:04:47.965 --> 02:04:49.960
TALIESIN: All right! All right, let's do it.

02:04:49.960 --> 02:04:54.162
MARISHA: I feel like if we go right up to the top
of the tower, it's like walking into the danger.

02:04:54.162 --> 02:04:57.498
TALIESIN: Let's bring the tower down to us.

02:04:57.498 --> 02:05:00.751
MARISHA: This is insane!

02:05:00.751 --> 02:05:04.379
LIAM: And you can still fuck shit up while you got
that earthquake going, right?

02:05:04.379 --> 02:05:06.865
MARISHA: Well, how do you mean?

02:05:06.865 --> 02:05:11.249
LAURA: Oh, yeah, if you have that spell going, you
can do other things in case things attack us?

02:05:11.249 --> 02:05:13.964
LIAM: Are you just doing Earthquake the whole
time, or are you just standing there staring at

02:05:13.964 --> 02:05:15.203
the ground?

02:05:15.203 --> 02:05:19.656
MARISHA: It's my concentration, so I can keep it
going and do an instant reaction spell.

02:05:19.656 --> 02:05:22.302
MATT: Do other things, you can't do another
concentration spell.

02:05:22.302 --> 02:05:24.735
LIAM: But you're not lightning anybody's ass, not
doing anything like that.

02:05:24.735 --> 02:05:26.032
You're focusing on the tower.

02:05:26.032 --> 02:05:28.800
MARISHA: I mean, I can throw a Fireball and keep
it going, yeah.

02:05:28.800 --> 02:05:31.458
LIAM: That's really big. All right.

02:05:31.458 --> 02:05:35.449
TALIESIN: I say the movers and shakers get the
cloaks. Let's head out.

02:05:35.449 --> 02:05:40.400
LAURA: Get up as close as we can to support Pike
and Keyleth.

02:05:40.400 --> 02:05:43.607
TALIESIN: And we keep them safe. We are playing
defense.

02:05:43.607 --> 02:05:44.627
LAURA: Yes.

02:05:44.627 --> 02:05:45.908
MARISHA: God, I hope this works.

02:05:45.908 --> 02:05:47.031
TALIESIN: God, I hope this works, too.

02:05:47.031 --> 02:05:48.409
MARISHA: I don't know if this is going to work!

02:05:48.409 --> 02:05:49.853
LAURA: This is stupid as fuck!

02:05:49.853 --> 02:05:54.118
TALIESIN: We're distance. Anybody gets near them,
we take them out.

02:05:54.118 --> 02:05:58.594
MARISHA: Grog, can you at the right moment just do
a big-- see if you can topple it over?

02:05:58.594 --> 02:06:01.401
TRAVIS: I can try and do whatever you want. I can
run around and punch

02:06:01.401 --> 02:06:03.044
a bunch of holes in it, whatever.

02:06:03.044 --> 02:06:08.508
TALIESIN: We're going to focus everything on one
side of the tower, we're going to try and bring it

02:06:08.508 --> 02:06:11.253
down in a direction. Here we go.

02:06:11.253 --> 02:06:15.227
LAURA: Yes, focus it on one side of the tower.
Both on the same side.

02:06:15.227 --> 02:06:23.749
TALIESIN: Like a tree. Let's do this. This is a
terrible plan. All right.

02:06:23.749 --> 02:06:25.499
LAURA Just trying to gauge Matt.

02:06:25.499 --> 02:06:27.413
MARISHA: I know! Matt's stone cold!

02:06:27.413 --> 02:06:30.049
TALIESIN: Matt's thinking about all the other
people he could be playing D&amp;D with right now.

02:06:30.049 --> 02:06:33.817
(laughing)

02:06:33.817 --> 02:06:36.101
TALIESIN: He's imagining a whole other set of
faces here.

02:06:36.101 --> 02:06:39.575
LIAM: All right, let's teleport inside that
dragon. Come on.

02:06:39.575 --> 02:06:41.154
MATT: Yeah, what's the plan, guys?

02:06:41.154 --> 02:06:42.246
LIAM: That's the plan.

02:06:42.246 --> 02:06:46.820
LAURA: We're going to get close enough so that
they can do their 500 feet distance. But keep a

02:06:46.820 --> 02:06:48.061
distance to the tower.

02:06:48.061 --> 02:06:52.638
MARISHA: And if we can be hidden while we're doing
this, instead of being open. We have a 500-foot

02:06:52.638 --> 02:06:55.568
range here. We've got a dope-ass range.

02:06:55.568 --> 02:06:57.101
TALIESIN: Keyleth's got a cloak. Pike's got a
cloak.

02:06:57.101 --> 02:06:59.503
TRAVIS: I'm huge.

02:06:59.503 --> 02:07:00.664
TALIESIN: He's huge.

02:07:00.664 --> 02:07:04.070
LAURA: We're going to try to get in a building
that's closer to the tower.

02:07:04.070 --> 02:07:08.678
MATT: Okay. Seeming lasts for eight hours, so
you're still under the guise of that illusion.

02:07:08.678 --> 02:07:11.199
SAM: Although we don't--

02:07:11.199 --> 02:07:12.613
LAURA: -- need that anymore.

02:07:12.613 --> 02:07:13.953
TALIESIN: Well, we can look like cultists.

02:07:13.953 --> 02:07:20.358
SAM: Keyleth, you said that there's no other
undead around here, right? Maybe we shouldn't look

02:07:20.358 --> 02:07:21.703
like undead, then.

02:07:21.703 --> 02:07:23.862
TALIESIN: Can you shift what we look like without
changing it?

02:07:23.862 --> 02:07:29.331
SAM: I don't think I can shift it. No, you can't.
That's a one-time thing.

02:07:29.331 --> 02:07:32.570
LAURA: Maybe just drop it and we'll be cultists.

02:07:32.570 --> 02:07:34.312
MARISHA: How many robes did we swipe?

02:07:34.312 --> 02:07:37.490
SAM: We've got the one from the guy whose head we
just crushed.

02:07:37.490 --> 02:07:41.519
MATT: You would have four cloaks, because there's
two you got from the outside at the ritual, and

02:07:41.519 --> 02:07:47.257
there's the one from the guy you killed when you
got here. Well, technically, there was the two

02:07:47.257 --> 02:07:51.273
that you killed when you got there, but you didn't
say you grabbed those. Oh, you did, you grabbed

02:07:51.273 --> 02:07:55.195
them off. So that's two, five, six. You have six
cloaks.

02:07:55.195 --> 02:07:57.360
LAURA: Yeah, and then the one, the guy that we
just killed in front of the --

02:07:57.360 --> 02:07:58.388
MATT: That was included.

02:07:58.388 --> 02:08:00.597
SAM: Me and Pike, she could be on my shoulders and
we could share one cloak.

02:08:00.597 --> 02:08:02.154
LAURA: Yeah! That's good!

02:08:02.154 --> 02:08:04.362
TRAVIS: I have that Cloak of Smashing that Percy
gave me.

02:08:04.362 --> 02:08:07.058
MARISHA: Totally 'Little Rascals' it! Oh, I love
it!

02:08:07.058 --> 02:08:08.659
LAURA: Yeah, we'll just robe it up.

02:08:08.659 --> 02:08:11.811
MATT: You guys all throw on the--

02:08:11.811 --> 02:08:13.609
ASHLEY: I almost feel like it should be the other
way around.

02:08:13.609 --> 02:08:15.057
SAM: Oh, it absolutely should.

02:08:15.057 --> 02:08:18.569
(laughter)

02:08:18.569 --> 02:08:32.459
MATT: Six cloaks, seven players. You guys are
straight-up doing-- I am so proud of everything

02:08:32.459 --> 02:08:34.623
that has just happened.

02:08:34.623 --> 02:08:39.776
(laughter)

02:08:39.776 --> 02:08:43.568
SAM: To make it look like our arms can reach the
ends of the cloak-- are they sleeved cloaks?

02:08:43.568 --> 02:08:44.672
MATT: Yes, they are.

02:08:44.672 --> 02:08:46.500
SAM: I'm going to hold a flute and my sword.

02:08:46.500 --> 02:08:48.929
(laughing)

02:08:48.929 --> 02:08:51.574
LIAM: Mythcarver! You used Mythcarver to pull a
Little Rascals!

02:08:51.574 --> 02:08:55.359
MATT: "There will be no survivors!"

02:08:55.359 --> 02:08:59.857
TALIESIN: "The dread Pirate Roberts is here for
your souls!"

02:08:59.857 --> 02:09:01.860
LIAM: Hey guys, it's the third time Scanlan has
used Mythcarver!

02:09:01.860 --> 02:09:04.343
(laughter)

02:09:04.343 --> 02:09:06.255
MARISHA: That's a vestige right there!

02:09:06.255 --> 02:09:11.363
TALIESIN: It's gone from exalted to shamed.

02:09:11.363 --> 02:09:14.563
MATT: It retracts into a dagger now.

02:09:14.563 --> 02:09:17.943
TALIESIN: Never happens. This never happens.

02:09:17.943 --> 02:09:26.614
MATT: All right. In a hip montage, you pull out
the various cloaks, assemble your materials,

02:09:26.614 --> 02:09:28.205
getting ready.

02:09:28.205 --> 02:09:30.220
TALIESIN: We are a bunch of assholes.

02:09:30.220 --> 02:09:34.951
MATT: Scanlan hops on top of Pike, the cloak is
placed over you. You get your sleeves ready, and

02:09:34.951 --> 02:09:42.442
you all walk out into the cold air of the
Shadowfell, making your way

02:09:42.442 --> 02:09:44.956
towards the center of the city.

02:09:44.956 --> 02:09:48.400
MARISHA: Be cool. Be cool.

02:09:48.400 --> 02:09:52.367
LIAM: I'm also going to say, some time in the last
several hours, I don't remember what the armor is

02:09:52.367 --> 02:09:54.241
set to, to necrotic.

02:09:54.241 --> 02:09:57.134
MATT: I think you may have said that before you
went in, just in case.

02:09:57.134 --> 02:09:58.566
I assumed that was the case.

02:09:58.566 --> 02:09:59.921
LAURA: I think that was already there, yeah.

02:09:59.921 --> 02:10:03.568
TALIESIN: And remember, if anyone looks at you,
close one eye. Just be winking.

02:10:03.568 --> 02:10:08.301
Always be winking. Left eye.

02:10:08.301 --> 02:10:12.501
LAURA: Does everybody have their arms, that we've
run into so far? Or are they missing an arm, too?

02:10:12.501 --> 02:10:14.036
An eye and an arm or just an eye?

02:10:14.036 --> 02:10:18.246
MATT: It varies. Not everyone seems to be missing
a hand, but most of them are missing an eye.

02:10:18.246 --> 02:10:19.487
LAURA: Okay.

02:10:19.487 --> 02:10:21.912
LIAM: You all look like my sister.

02:10:21.912 --> 02:10:28.466
MARISHA: You need to get your eyes checked, then.
Your depth perception may be off.

02:10:28.466 --> 02:10:31.969
SAM: All right, we go!

02:10:31.969 --> 02:10:41.920
MATT: All right. You guys make your way up the
street, following behind the few stragglers that

02:10:41.920 --> 02:10:47.051
you see trying to catch up with the rest of the
groups of people that have filtered out of the

02:10:47.051 --> 02:10:51.009
buildings and made their way towards the center.
You make your way through some of the side roads,

02:10:51.009 --> 02:10:55.052
following around, and you can see now that the
closer you get to the city, the more the

02:10:55.052 --> 02:11:01.367
structures, the buildings here, are built in a
spiral. The roads don't intersect at spokes, they

02:11:01.367 --> 02:11:05.729
all gradually curve in to the tower. If you're
looking at it overhead, it looks like this large

02:11:05.729 --> 02:11:13.455
spiral into the tower, like a pinwheel. You follow
the curvature of the road, which prevents you from

02:11:13.455 --> 02:11:17.969
seeing the end point, and as you begin to get
close to some of the clusters of people that are

02:11:17.969 --> 02:11:23.496
walking with a brisk walk, but still walking
towards the tower, you fall back a little bit to

02:11:23.496 --> 02:11:29.369
not draw any attention. As you're making your way
there, you watch as two individuals hurry up that

02:11:29.369 --> 02:11:34.947
were a little bit behind you, and rush up to the
side and are walking in pace. They glance over.

02:11:34.947 --> 02:11:42.662
MARISHA: Hoods forward.

02:11:42.662 --> 02:11:50.515
MATT: One of them, who appears to be a younger
man, probably 18, 19 or so, who's got this little

02:11:50.515 --> 02:11:59.853
patch of reddish brown chin fuzz and looks a
little malnourished. He still has both eyes. He

02:11:59.853 --> 02:12:04.047
rushes up real fast, his hood pulling back a
little bit, and he's looking around, excited but

02:12:04.047 --> 02:12:10.952
also with trepidation. "So it's happening, huh?
It's really happening!"

02:12:10.952 --> 02:12:12.392
LAURA: I guess so.

02:12:12.392 --> 02:12:14.323
LIAM: It's fucking wild.

02:12:14.323 --> 02:12:15.995
LAURA: So exciting.

02:12:15.995 --> 02:12:18.541
SAM: I'm so excited to be here!

02:12:18.541 --> 02:12:19.721
LAURA: Oh, don't.

02:12:19.721 --> 02:12:21.844
MATT: Make a deception check.

02:12:21.844 --> 02:12:25.049
TRAVIS: Keep your mouth shut! Just keep your mouth
shut!

02:12:25.049 --> 02:12:27.550
MARISHA: Just nod and smile.

02:12:27.550 --> 02:12:29.894
SAM: 24.

02:12:29.894 --> 02:12:43.409
MATT: He looks at you and goes, "Oh! I didn't know
the Whispered One takes the special ones, too!"

02:12:43.409 --> 02:12:45.450
TRAVIS: Yep! Sure does!

02:12:45.450 --> 02:12:49.014
TALIESIN: What are you going to do after?

02:12:49.014 --> 02:12:50.827
MATT: "I don't know."

02:12:50.827 --> 02:12:53.452
TALIESIN: Surely you've thought.

02:12:53.452 --> 02:13:01.307
MATT: "I'm pretty low on the totem pole here. I'm
just excited to be on the right side of history."

02:13:01.307 --> 02:13:05.095
LAURA: Ditto.

02:13:05.095 --> 02:13:08.294
LIAM: Fuck the normies.

02:13:08.294 --> 02:13:12.858
MATT: "All right." And he rushes up past you guys
to try and catch up.

02:13:12.858 --> 02:13:14.306
SAM: So awkward.

02:13:14.306 --> 02:13:18.320
LAURA: I think he bought it. I think we played it
really cool there, guys.

02:13:18.320 --> 02:13:21.577
MARISHA: I'm really bad at holding my eye shut for
this long.

02:13:21.577 --> 02:13:25.861
TALIESIN: So are we close enough now that we can
start this?

02:13:25.861 --> 02:13:29.689
MATT: Not yet. You're about maybe 1,000 feet or so
away.

02:13:29.689 --> 02:13:32.162
TALIESIN: I'm going to see if there's any
structures that are within distance so that once

02:13:32.162 --> 02:13:35.168
they set up and start, I can get to them. Maybe we
can perch.

02:13:35.168 --> 02:13:37.474
MARISHA: We only need to be so far out.

02:13:37.474 --> 02:13:40.126
TALIESIN: We can cover you from a roof.

02:13:40.126 --> 02:13:41.815
MATT: Perception check, Percival.

02:13:41.815 --> 02:13:44.634
LIAM: Also wondering how we're doing in the gloom
stalker department?

02:13:44.634 --> 02:13:51.103
MATT: No one's seen you, currently. It seems that
whatever piercing vision they have, it does not

02:13:51.103 --> 02:13:52.422
seem to pierce robes.

02:13:52.422 --> 02:13:54.579
LAURA: I want to keep an eye out for buildings,
too.

02:13:54.579 --> 02:13:56.072
TALIESIN: 15.

02:13:56.072 --> 02:13:58.270
MATT: Okay. Then you as well make a perception
check.

02:13:58.270 --> 02:13:59.916
TALIESIN: Please.

02:13:59.916 --> 02:14:04.769
LAURA: 23.

02:14:04.769 --> 02:14:11.117
MATT: 23. Okay. You glance about, and there are a
lot of buildings here with vantage points. They're

02:14:11.117 --> 02:14:17.176
all similar heights. There are a few that are
outliers, but most of them are one and a half to

02:14:17.176 --> 02:14:23.406
two stories, like a one story with an attic or an
attic space, like a half-story. Or two stories.

02:14:23.406 --> 02:14:29.412
You do check a few that are third-story, and a lot
of them are almost in steeple-like spires at the

02:14:29.412 --> 02:14:34.967
top. You start to notice there is a theme. A lot
of the buildings closer to the tower are built in

02:14:34.967 --> 02:14:40.418
a similar theme as the tower itself. You begin to
see the edges of the roofs curve up into their own

02:14:40.418 --> 02:14:48.980
spikes, and the further in you go, the more
dangerous and unwelcoming the deeper inner

02:14:48.980 --> 02:14:56.562
cloister of Thar Amphala is to witness. You can
see now certain people are climbing onto the

02:14:56.562 --> 02:15:02.432
roofs. They're getting up there, almost like
they're preparing for some sort of a festival or a

02:15:02.432 --> 02:15:03.692
fireworks show.

02:15:03.692 --> 02:15:05.023
MARISHA: Like the Fourth of fucking July.

02:15:05.023 --> 02:15:06.756
LAURA: The aliens are coming and we're welcoming
them.

02:15:06.756 --> 02:15:08.521
TRAVIS: Well, they're not wrong.

02:15:08.521 --> 02:15:20.241
MATT: You notice, Vex... There's been no change in
daylight or nightlight here. It's been this

02:15:20.241 --> 02:15:28.035
constant deep, dark gray gloom that hangs over the
Shadowfell, unchanging, unshifting. There's a

02:15:28.035 --> 02:15:31.899
creeping brightness on the horizon that you feel
rising.

02:15:31.899 --> 02:15:34.512
LAURA: We're getting ready to teleport.

02:15:34.512 --> 02:15:43.223
MATT: And you watch as that creeping brightness
forms a dome over your space, and then comes to a

02:15:43.223 --> 02:15:48.643
close over the top of the tower, and where once
there was this gloomy skyscape, you now see what

02:15:48.643 --> 02:15:55.037
appears to be a brighter, clouded sky. The
temperature grows a little colder, and you begin

02:15:55.037 --> 02:16:04.143
to see snowfall. Gentle snow begins to fall, and
you watch as some of the cultists surrounding

02:16:04.143 --> 02:16:06.383
start reaching up and catching it in their hands.

02:16:06.383 --> 02:16:07.750
TALIESIN: Now, now!

02:16:07.750 --> 02:16:09.680
SAM: We've still got to attack.

02:16:09.680 --> 02:16:13.024
MARISHA: It's totally taken us to Whitestone.

02:16:13.024 --> 02:16:15.427
SAM: It's okay, we can still kill everybody.

02:16:15.427 --> 02:16:16.922
MATT: Make a nature check.

02:16:16.922 --> 02:16:21.785
LAURA: We're in the north. There's a lot of places
that snow. It could be Draconia. There's a lot of

02:16:21.785 --> 02:16:22.892
places that snow.

02:16:22.892 --> 02:16:25.025
LIAM: But it's Delilah Briarwood.

02:16:25.025 --> 02:16:27.584
MARISHA: 19.

02:16:27.584 --> 02:16:35.848
MATT: You have no direct idea of where you are,
but based on the weather that you left Whitestone

02:16:35.848 --> 02:16:43.994
in not too long ago, this isn't Whitestone or near
Whitestone. The weather patterns are a little more

02:16:43.994 --> 02:16:47.340
classic snow.

02:16:47.340 --> 02:16:50.886
LAURA: Is it winter in Wildemount right now?

02:16:50.886 --> 02:16:57.038
MATT: It's the tail end of winter in a few
places.

02:16:57.038 --> 02:17:00.810
LIAM: Tower still needs to come down.

02:17:00.810 --> 02:17:06.311
SAM: Let's go. Let's move. Let's attack. Are we
within 500 feet?

02:17:06.311 --> 02:17:12.542
MATT: You guys are about now within 500 feet.

02:17:12.542 --> 02:17:16.146
LAURA: Fucking get into the building that we can,
and then start it.

02:17:16.146 --> 02:17:20.732
MARISHA: Pike and I huddle together and try and
join forces.

02:17:20.732 --> 02:17:23.454
ASHLEY: Let's do it.

02:17:23.454 --> 02:17:24.637
MARISHA: Let's do it.

02:17:24.637 --> 02:17:36.178
MATT: As you guys are holding hands, a voice
begins to ring out. Omnipresent. Directionless,

02:17:36.178 --> 02:17:45.220
like it's being positioned directly into the minds
of each of you from wherever it stands. It's an

02:17:45.220 --> 02:17:54.836
unfamiliar voice. The words creep and curl in,
like they've always been resting, and now is the

02:17:54.836 --> 02:18:00.725
moment is for them to reveal themselves.

02:18:00.725 --> 02:18:09.632
"I would ask you to 
listen before you make a fool of

02:18:09.632 --> 02:18:29.055
"yourselves. I've watched you since you stepped
into my domain, and I'm not going to lie, it's

02:18:29.055 --> 02:18:44.174
"been entertaining. I admire your gumption. It
reminds me of others who have tried what you are

02:18:44.174 --> 02:19:06.398
"trying. But they're dead now, so I leave the
choice to you. You can either walk away, or you

02:19:06.398 --> 02:19:18.358
"can join me, or you will die, and join me
anyway."

02:19:18.358 --> 02:19:26.752
LAURA: Eff that shit. Just do it.

02:19:26.825 --> 02:19:30.186
LIAM: No one walks away.

02:19:30.186 --> 02:19:36.287
MARISHA: People don't tell us to stop if they're
not afraid of what we're doing.

02:19:36.287 --> 02:19:37.738
TALIESIN: To the end.

02:19:37.738 --> 02:19:39.295
LAURA: To the end.

02:19:39.295 --> 02:19:42.836
SAM: To the end.

02:19:42.836 --> 02:19:45.970
TALIESIN: Yeah, let's just pretend that's not
really happening.

02:19:45.970 --> 02:19:48.129
LAURA: Do it.

02:19:48.129 --> 02:19:55.922
MARISHA: I love you all. We do it, above the
screaming, howling Horror Nights sound effects.

02:19:55.922 --> 02:19:57.474
TALIESIN: I pull Silence.

02:19:57.474 --> 02:20:03.793
MATT: All right. As you guys clasp hands, and
begin the intricate incantation for the Earthquake

02:20:03.793 --> 02:20:09.731
spell, you can hear the cheers of people on the
rooftops. They're standing up now, and they're all

02:20:09.731 --> 02:20:16.540
shouting, "Yes! Yes, I hear you!" You get the
sense that perhaps you weren't the only ones that

02:20:16.540 --> 02:20:24.851
have been spoken to, although the conversations
may differ from individual to individual. As you

02:20:24.851 --> 02:20:34.860
guys complete your incantation, you watch as the
dust begins to rise around the base. You see

02:20:34.860 --> 02:20:46.009
Entropis begin to quiver back and forth, and you
watch as everyone begins to rush to the edge of

02:20:46.009 --> 02:20:50.266
the rooftops, then rush into the streets to look
up, their hands raised to the sky, not sure what

02:20:50.266 --> 02:21:03.399
this means, but basking in whatever glory this
next sign or omen is to be. You watch as a loud,

02:21:03.399 --> 02:21:11.533
shattering crack sound hits, and you watch as one
large, snaking, carving line begins to work its

02:21:11.533 --> 02:21:19.400
way up one side of the tower. Up another. And the
collective gasp of hundreds of voices across the

02:21:19.400 --> 02:21:32.850
city seem to echo, (gasps). You watch as one side
buckles, and the tower begins to slowly (rumble)

02:21:32.850 --> 02:21:36.548
to the ground.

02:21:36.548 --> 02:21:38.494
SAM: Is it falling towards us?

02:21:38.494 --> 02:21:40.249
MATT: It's falling not towards you.

02:21:40.249 --> 02:21:43.687
ASHLEY: We thought of that.

02:21:43.687 --> 02:21:46.147
MATT: But not the entire tower.

02:21:46.147 --> 02:21:47.632
TALIESIN: Fuck.

02:21:47.632 --> 02:21:56.983
MATT: You glance up and watch as the very apex,
the three-clawed top of the tower, is just there,

02:21:56.983 --> 02:22:06.242
in the sky, held aloft, unmoving, as the rest of
the tower seems to have (rumble) broken away, and

02:22:06.242 --> 02:22:14.549
as it falls, this slow, terrifying collapse, you
hear the rumbling of broken stone slamming into

02:22:14.549 --> 02:22:20.517
earth as clouds of smoke, dust, and dead earth are
kicked up from the impact of this falling tower,

02:22:20.517 --> 02:22:27.384
completely enswirling the center of the city with
debris and darkness. You watch as cultists go

02:22:27.384 --> 02:22:32.370
running now, their faces filled with fear and
confusion at what this suddenly means, what's

02:22:32.370 --> 02:22:42.956
happening. As the dust washes past you, it gives
this haze over the sky, and slowly comes to fade.

02:22:42.956 --> 02:22:56.791
You all, taking in what's happening, watch as that
one apex of the spire slowly makes its way down to

02:22:56.791 --> 02:23:05.744
the surface of wherever you are on top of the
rubble that once stood as Entropis.

02:23:05.744 --> 02:23:07.650
MARISHA: It kind of worked.

02:23:07.650 --> 02:23:09.371
SAM: I mean, it wasn't bad.

02:23:09.371 --> 02:23:15.877
MARISHA: It brought it down. Did anyone of
significance die in the process?

02:23:15.877 --> 02:23:18.315
MATT: You can only assume.

02:23:18.315 --> 02:23:19.946
LAURA: Can we see who it is?

02:23:19.946 --> 02:23:22.308
MATT: You're too far away. You're 500 feet away
from this.

02:23:22.308 --> 02:23:23.782
SAM: Let's go.

02:23:23.782 --> 02:23:26.383
LAURA: Let's go.

02:23:26.383 --> 02:23:29.697
TALIESIN: Broom.

02:23:29.697 --> 02:23:33.130
TRAVIS: We're going up to it or waiting till it
comes down all the way?

02:23:33.130 --> 02:23:35.060
SAM: Oh, I mean, it's landing, right?

02:23:35.060 --> 02:23:40.018
MATT: It's landed. It settled itself. It's kind of
cocked to one side. For it to land in the rubble,

02:23:40.018 --> 02:23:46.133
it's not a perfect platform, it (rumble) and comes
to rest at a very faint angle among the ruined,

02:23:46.133 --> 02:23:55.521
broken, jagged obsidian pile. It's a thousand
million flecked arrowheads all jumbled in this

02:23:55.521 --> 02:24:03.111
broken glass-like landscape of destroyed tower,
and there, the very zenith of this once-grand

02:24:03.111 --> 02:24:05.280
structure sits resting, waiting.

02:24:05.280 --> 02:24:07.183
TALIESIN: Let's do this.

02:24:07.183 --> 02:24:10.190
SAM: Do we have an escape plan?

02:24:10.190 --> 02:24:12.187
TRAVIS: Kill everything.

02:24:12.187 --> 02:24:17.839
MARISHA: I can Plane Shift us if things get really
bad, but I kind of think

02:24:17.839 --> 02:24:20.077
we're already on our plane.

02:24:20.077 --> 02:24:26.292
LAURA: This sounds like we're all going to die!

02:24:26.292 --> 02:24:27.950
SAM: Sure does.

02:24:27.950 --> 02:24:30.013
ASHLEY: All right, guys, we're going to do this.
We're going to do this.

02:24:30.013 --> 02:24:31.773
LIAM: Start walking.

02:24:31.773 --> 02:24:35.212
TALIESIN: The minute I grab onto your broom, you
can't hear anything, so I'm just going to ride it

02:24:35.212 --> 02:24:36.951
down to the ground and then let go.

02:24:36.951 --> 02:24:38.409
LAURA: Okay.

02:24:38.409 --> 02:24:43.081
TRAVIS: Well, I'm done playing, so I'm going to
take the Titan Stone Knuckles and smash them

02:24:43.081 --> 02:24:45.165
together and cast Enlarge on myself.

02:24:45.165 --> 02:24:50.189
MATT: Your cloak tears around your body,
Incredible Hulk style as your form ruins what

02:24:50.189 --> 02:24:56.058
remains of the black, sheared fabric that once,
even by the stretch of the imagination,

02:24:56.058 --> 02:24:58.369
pseudo-hid you, now...

02:24:58.369 --> 02:24:59.483
TRAVIS: A bib remains.

02:24:59.483 --> 02:25:07.183
MATT: Exactly. It's almost like one of those
Chippendale neckpieces. What you see is a number

02:25:07.183 --> 02:25:12.352
of cultists that were running away from the tower
stop and see this, and then, almost instinctually,

02:25:12.352 --> 02:25:18.330
go to defend. Make an intimidation check.

02:25:18.330 --> 02:25:22.388
TRAVIS: Should've raged. That's not terrible. 24.

02:25:22.388 --> 02:25:29.190
MATT: And go scattering in other directions. You
see some are rushing towards the tower to see what

02:25:29.190 --> 02:25:35.580
happened, to see if anyone's okay. There are a lot
of cultists that were crushed, you imagine, on

02:25:35.580 --> 02:25:40.642
that side of the city, especially since they were
clustering at the base for whatever this was. But

02:25:40.642 --> 02:25:45.682
many more are still out in the streets as you guys
walk (footsteps),

02:25:45.682 --> 02:25:47.854
making your way towards the central tower.

02:25:47.854 --> 02:25:52.793
LAURA: I take off the robes. Get ready. Slow
motion walk towards the tower.

02:25:52.793 --> 02:26:04.064
MATT: You make your way down the ruined city
streets of Thar Amphala. Amongst the snowfall

02:26:04.064 --> 02:26:09.234
that's now beginning to gather on the tops of your
heads and your shoulders and your wings, and along

02:26:09.234 --> 02:26:17.482
the sides of the street that hadn't seen snowfall,
probably ever. You make your way past the final

02:26:17.482 --> 02:26:24.715
boundary buildings, the cultists just letting you
pass, looks of fear, looks of excitement, looks of

02:26:24.715 --> 02:26:31.250
knowing, looks of understanding that you probably
walk to your deaths and I want to watch this

02:26:31.250 --> 02:26:37.352
happen. You begin to step over the rubble, your
footfalls finding the grinding, high-pitched

02:26:37.352 --> 02:26:48.426
cracks of broken glass-like obsidian beneath your
feet. There you look up, and can see about 25 or

02:26:48.426 --> 02:26:56.008
30 feet of the tower top is resting at an angle.
You can't see what's up on top of it. No windows.

02:26:56.008 --> 02:26:58.243
How do you wish to proceed?

02:26:58.243 --> 02:27:05.434
LIAM: We're not sneaking up on shit.

02:27:05.434 --> 02:27:08.938
LAURA: Well, no. They know we're here.

02:27:08.938 --> 02:27:13.801
TRAVIS: Circle? Flank? All together? Which one?

02:27:13.801 --> 02:27:17.669
TALIESIN: Powerhouses together. Distance fighters
keep their distance.

02:27:17.669 --> 02:27:19.735
I'll take the carpet if it's available.

02:27:19.735 --> 02:27:21.883
LAURA: Surround the tower, climb up each side?

02:27:21.883 --> 02:27:23.024
TRAVIS: I would.

02:27:23.024 --> 02:27:26.510
TALIESIN: I'm going to grab the carpet. Anybody
who wants a lift up, feel free.

02:27:26.510 --> 02:27:28.422
TRAVIS: I will take that ride.

02:27:28.422 --> 02:27:30.696
LAURA: I'll broom it.

02:27:30.696 --> 02:27:32.696
ASHLEY: I'll hop up on the carpet.

02:27:32.696 --> 02:27:34.439
TALIESIN: Carpet's full.

02:27:34.439 --> 02:27:41.351
MATT: As you guys are getting yourselves prepared,
that voice returns to you, echoing through your

02:27:41.351 --> 02:27:43.274
minds once again.

02:27:43.274 --> 02:28:00.278
"I am genuinely impressed. I'm
excited. And I would like for you to remain to

02:28:00.278 --> 02:28:18.355
"watch my ascension, but far be it for me to rob
anyone of a fine death, so come. Come, and be the

02:28:18.355 --> 02:28:22.931
"next sacrifice for the new age."

02:28:22.931 --> 02:28:28.029
LAURA: You're a dipshit!

02:28:28.029 --> 02:28:32.082
TRAVIS: Eloquence personified.

02:28:32.082 --> 02:28:36.652
MATT: So, via broom...

02:28:36.652 --> 02:28:39.342
SAM: We have to fly to get up to it?

02:28:39.342 --> 02:28:40.968
LAURA: It's 35 feet up, so.

02:28:40.968 --> 02:28:42.483
MARISHA: To the top of the tower?

02:28:42.483 --> 02:28:44.614
TRAVIS: Platform, whatever you want to call it.

02:28:44.614 --> 02:28:46.792
LIAM: I'm going to shoot up and past by quite a
bit.

02:28:46.792 --> 02:28:48.765
MARISHA: Can I hop on a carpet or broom?

02:28:48.765 --> 02:28:50.236
LAURA: You can hop on my broom.

02:28:50.236 --> 02:28:51.750
TALIESIN: I was about to say, carpet's a bit
full.

02:28:51.750 --> 02:28:53.381
MARISHA: I'll hop on the broom with Vex.

02:28:53.381 --> 02:28:54.991
SAM: I need a ride as well.

02:28:54.991 --> 02:28:56.867
TALIESIN: Once I'm up, I'm going to scatter.

02:28:56.867 --> 02:29:02.992
SAM: Do you want me to be a beholder? Or a
dragon?

02:29:02.992 --> 02:29:09.018
MARISHA: Beholder has the anti-magic cone eye
situation. Just wait and see.

02:29:09.018 --> 02:29:13.186
SAM: Wait and see? Figured I should do it now.

02:29:13.186 --> 02:29:15.482
TALIESIN: How long can you maintain a beholder?

02:29:15.482 --> 02:29:17.200
MARISHA: How long does it last to cast?

02:29:17.200 --> 02:29:18.831
SAM: It's instantaneous.

02:29:18.831 --> 02:29:20.927
TALIESIN: Oh, then wait until the moment that it's
necessary.

02:29:20.927 --> 02:29:25.383
SAM: But he could Counterspell it unless I do it
now.

02:29:25.383 --> 02:29:27.738
LAURA: I don't know if he's actually here yet.

02:29:27.738 --> 02:29:36.316
MATT: Help me put this down right... There.

02:29:36.316 --> 02:29:45.737
ASHLEY: That's awesome.

02:29:45.737 --> 02:29:51.484
LAURA: I feel like whenever we come across a map,
I feel like we walked into his hand, exactly where

02:29:51.484 --> 02:29:52.580
he wanted us.

02:29:52.580 --> 02:29:54.302
TRAVIS: Let's also talk about the fact that it's
been years since we've been this close to a map.

02:29:54.302 --> 02:29:55.514
MATT: This is also true.

02:29:55.514 --> 02:29:56.641
TALIESIN: That is true.

02:29:56.641 --> 02:30:05.713
MATT: Please. Indulge me where you're coming in
from. And these resemble the three curved spires.

02:30:05.713 --> 02:30:10.956
TRAVIS: Those ideally go like that above it,
right?

02:30:10.956 --> 02:30:12.871
MATT: Yeah, they curve upward and stop about
there.

02:30:12.871 --> 02:30:14.418
TALIESIN: So they're not platform-y.

02:30:14.418 --> 02:30:16.944
MATT: No. They come to a point.

02:30:16.944 --> 02:30:27.853
TALIESIN: I'm hiding behind this glowing spire.
I'm going to take some cover behind.

02:30:27.853 --> 02:30:32.036
MATT: You rush. We're looking for landing
placement, here. This'll come into play, here.

02:30:32.036 --> 02:30:33.691
Grog, where are you going?

02:30:33.691 --> 02:30:36.671
TRAVIS: I'll go right there.

02:30:36.671 --> 02:30:38.643
MATT: Right there.

02:30:38.643 --> 02:30:41.922
LAURA: Me and Keyleth-- do you want to land over
here?

02:30:41.922 --> 02:30:44.354
MARISHA: That's fine. Yeah, I follow your lead.

02:30:44.354 --> 02:30:48.813
LAURA: As soon as I land, I bamf Trinket out.

02:30:48.813 --> 02:30:54.248
MATT: Vax.

02:30:54.248 --> 02:31:07.270
LIAM: I'm going to say that I'm about 80 feet in
the air, just off-center. Towards Vex and Keyleth,

02:31:07.270 --> 02:31:13.342
but just off-center.

02:31:13.342 --> 02:31:16.822
LAURA: Keep a distance, don't be in a line with
us.

02:31:16.822 --> 02:31:19.866
LIAM: I'm going to say I'm there, straight up.

02:31:19.866 --> 02:31:25.924
MATT: There you are, Vax, right there.

02:31:25.924 --> 02:31:30.144
TRAVIS: The minis look so cool!

02:31:30.144 --> 02:31:32.413
TALIESIN: I haven't seen them in so long.

02:31:32.413 --> 02:31:34.124
TRAVIS: I know, we've been so far away!

02:31:34.124 --> 02:31:35.589
TALIESIN: Who's left? Pike?

02:31:35.589 --> 02:31:40.056
MATT: Pike and Scanlan. Because you took the
carpet, you're going to have to be near Grog for

02:31:40.056 --> 02:31:45.106
where you guys land. Going to be the circumstance
there. Percy,

02:31:45.106 --> 02:31:46.761
you just run up the side to get there?

02:31:46.761 --> 02:31:50.412
TALIESIN: No, I was on the carpet and hopped and
left them because they had to go pick up.

02:31:50.412 --> 02:31:52.763
MATT: If that's the case, then I'll say that
you're landing.

02:31:52.763 --> 02:31:54.099
TALIESIN: No, they had to go get Scanlan--

02:31:54.099 --> 02:31:56.381
MATT: Oh, you had to go get Scanlan?

02:31:56.381 --> 02:31:57.807
TALIESIN: It's 35 feet.

02:31:57.807 --> 02:32:00.146
MATT: If you guys had leave Scanlan behind, that's
a whole different thing.

02:32:00.146 --> 02:32:03.757
SAM: No, I think I'm going to just go ahead and be
a beholder and fly in there myself.

02:32:03.757 --> 02:32:05.335
TALIESIN: Okay, that'll work.

02:32:05.335 --> 02:32:06.787
MATT: Okay!

02:32:06.787 --> 02:32:13.122
TRAVIS: Wow! Okay! All right! YOLO, why the fuck
not?

02:32:13.122 --> 02:32:19.942
TALIESIN: If you'd be so kind, throw me here,
then.

02:32:19.942 --> 02:32:23.169
LIAM: Someday, we could have a game with two
beholders on our side.

02:32:23.169 --> 02:32:26.540
MARISHA: It's true! But not today.

02:32:26.540 --> 02:32:28.434
MATT: That's Scanlan.

02:32:28.434 --> 02:32:31.061
(laughter)

02:32:31.061 --> 02:32:35.996
TALIESIN: I like that you found a goofy-looking
beholder. (goofy voice) Hi!

02:32:35.996 --> 02:32:39.281
ASHLEY and MARISHA: Hey, you guys!

02:32:39.281 --> 02:32:51.349
MATT: As you guys arrive, the floor is just
surrounded in bodies. Cultists of very ornate

02:32:51.349 --> 02:32:56.965
robes. Mostly you've seen peon-based: black
splatters of sackcloth, what was available.

02:32:56.965 --> 02:32:58.703
LAURA: They've been &lt;i&gt;peed&lt;/i&gt; on?!

02:32:58.703 --> 02:33:05.946
MATT: No. these are well-adorned and appear to
have been very well-regarded within the Remnants.

02:33:05.946 --> 02:33:15.075
You also see, on this side, what appears to be--
sorry, on this side would be Delilah Briarwood.

02:33:15.075 --> 02:33:16.981
LAURA: Bitchface Briarwood.

02:33:16.981 --> 02:33:18.773
MARISHA: Bitchface Briarwood!

02:33:18.773 --> 02:33:27.816
MATT: On this side, you see what appears to be a
black, armored, massive, not quite goliath-sized,

02:33:27.816 --> 02:33:41.526
but a thick, dark black knight of jagged dark
metal armor, what appears to be a longsword that

02:33:41.526 --> 02:33:52.630
emanates this dark energy, and floating above--

02:33:52.630 --> 02:34:01.897
TALIESIN: Oh, balls.

02:34:01.897 --> 02:34:03.956
LAURA: Oh no, what's flying?

02:34:03.956 --> 02:34:05.518
ASHLEY: Put it away.

02:34:05.518 --> 02:34:07.607
LAURA: No, I don't need it!

02:34:07.607 --> 02:34:10.131
LIAM: Those are my platforms, I can take them back
anytime I want!

02:34:10.131 --> 02:34:12.493
LAURA: Oh no! What is that?

02:34:12.493 --> 02:34:27.619
MATT: You see a man, though the flesh is pulled
tight against a skeletal frame. You see long, red

02:34:27.619 --> 02:34:34.112
and purple and black robes that are tattered and
drift below the breeze and cold gently blowing by.

02:34:34.112 --> 02:34:42.146
You see a field of crackling energy just bursting
around the outskirts of his form. You see one hand

02:34:42.146 --> 02:34:50.405
is out, in a welcoming position, while the empty
wrist that once contained a hand is now open on

02:34:50.405 --> 02:34:58.332
the other side. You see the bald, hairless head,
which is covered in spots and tugged open, bits of

02:34:58.332 --> 02:35:04.124
flesh that have curled away from rotten decay. You
see the cheeks sunken in where the skeletal teeth

02:35:04.124 --> 02:35:13.417
are now emblazoned in a terrible grin. You see the
right eye, and the gaping hole where a bright

02:35:13.417 --> 02:35:22.276
green, bursting, flaming vacuous void where an eye
once was now drifts off a trail behind it. You see

02:35:22.276 --> 02:35:33.925
there, reborn before you, the Whispered One, the
Undying King. Vecna himself.

02:35:33.925 --> 02:35:35.810
TRAVIS: Oh god, we're in it!

02:35:35.810 --> 02:35:37.328
TALIESIN: I don't like it being this close.

02:35:37.406 --> 02:35:38.676
SAM: We'll probably all die.

02:35:38.676 --> 02:35:40.206
MATT: I would like you all to roll initiative.

02:35:40.206 --> 02:35:42.220
(screaming)

02:35:42.220 --> 02:35:43.236
TRAVIS: No!

02:35:43.236 --> 02:35:47.485
SAM: Matthew Mercer, may I borrow your Monster
Manual so I know what I am?

02:35:47.485 --> 02:35:51.816
MATT: Marisha actually has a page for it, if you
want that.

02:35:51.816 --> 02:35:53.930
MARISHA: I do have a page. Do you want my beholder
page?

02:35:53.930 --> 02:35:55.176
SAM: Yeah!

02:35:55.176 --> 02:35:56.514
TALIESIN: That's terrible.

02:35:56.514 --> 02:35:58.034
MARISHA: That's terrible for me, too.

02:35:58.034 --> 02:35:59.441
LAURA: My teeth hurt.

02:35:59.441 --> 02:36:01.196
MATT: My teeth hurt?!

02:36:01.196 --> 02:36:08.988
TALIESIN: That's terrible. I'm not okay with that
roll.

02:36:08.988 --> 02:36:11.348
MARISHA: Oh, give me that back page. Sorry.

02:36:11.348 --> 02:36:12.739
TALIESIN: Back page.

02:36:12.739 --> 02:36:16.851
SAM: It doesn't say what his initiative is.

02:36:16.851 --> 02:36:25.040
TALIESIN: You have to roll. It's a dex modifier
plus a d20 if you don't have initiative?

02:36:25.040 --> 02:36:26.675
MATT: What's that?

02:36:26.675 --> 02:36:28.644
TALIESIN: Your initiative is normal.

02:36:28.644 --> 02:36:32.107
MATT: Your initiative is whatever the creature's
initiative is, which is its dex modifier.

02:36:32.107 --> 02:36:33.733
SAM: Okay. All right.

02:36:33.733 --> 02:36:35.105
TALIESIN: Plus a d20.

02:36:35.105 --> 02:36:36.168
SAM: 11.

02:36:36.168 --> 02:36:38.713
LIAM: When was the last time we went to bed?

02:36:38.713 --> 02:36:41.280
LAURA: I mean, it's a normal amount of time.

02:36:41.280 --> 02:36:44.541
LIAM: No, I mean, like, right before coming? I
can't remember the last time we had a full rest.

02:36:44.541 --> 02:36:53.196
MATT: A full rest would have been maybe four or
five hours ago.

02:36:53.196 --> 02:36:57.014
LIAM: Okay. I think I have all my Lucks. That's
why I'm asking.

02:36:57.014 --> 02:36:59.628
TALIESIN: I don't think you've burned since we've
come through.

02:36:59.628 --> 02:37:01.256
LIAM: Not 100% sure.

02:37:01.321 --> 02:37:03.092
MARISHA: I also gave you advantage on everything.

02:37:03.092 --> 02:37:04.622
LIAM: I know it! Girl!

02:37:04.622 --> 02:37:06.587
MARISHA: I think you didn't use anything.

02:37:06.587 --> 02:37:12.434
MATT: Initiative order. 25 to 20?

02:37:12.434 --> 02:37:16.022
TRAVIS: 20. Shit.

02:37:16.022 --> 02:37:18.323
MATT: Fuck, guys. Guys.

02:37:18.323 --> 02:37:21.022
TRAVIS: Me?! Okay.

02:37:21.022 --> 02:37:25.809
LAURA: I have no plan!

02:37:25.809 --> 02:37:28.868
ASHLEY: We're fully Leeroy Jenkins-ing.

02:37:28.868 --> 02:37:33.085
LAURA: Fully. Leeroy Jenkins!

02:37:33.085 --> 02:37:40.322
MATT: Grog, what's your dex?

02:37:40.322 --> 02:37:43.966
TRAVIS: My dexterity? 15.

02:37:43.966 --> 02:37:49.079
MATT: Okay. Technically, you rolled the same
initiative as the death knight,

02:37:49.079 --> 02:37:51.394
so he'll go right after you.

02:37:51.394 --> 02:37:59.913
TRAVIS: Okay. The death knight, by the way, is
what Colonel Arnold Fuck is.

02:37:59.913 --> 02:38:01.465
MATT: 20 to 15.

02:38:01.465 --> 02:38:02.517
LIAM: 16.

02:38:02.517 --> 02:38:03.752
LAURA: 18.

02:38:03.752 --> 02:38:05.117
ASHLEY: 17.

02:38:05.117 --> 02:38:06.541
LAURA: Ooh, nice!

02:38:06.541 --> 02:38:09.296
MATT: You had 18, 17.

02:38:09.296 --> 02:38:18.280
LIAM: 16. Sylas, broomstick-up-his-ass, death
knight Briarwood.

02:38:18.280 --> 02:38:21.057
SAM: 11.

02:38:21.057 --> 02:38:22.763
TALIESIN: 13.

02:38:22.763 --> 02:38:28.416
LAURA: This first round is definitely a surprise
attack on them, right?

02:38:28.416 --> 02:38:30.310
MATT: Oh yeah! Totally!

02:38:30.310 --> 02:38:31.406
MARISHA: Seven.

02:38:31.406 --> 02:38:33.760
TALIESIN: They did not see this shit coming. At
all.

02:38:33.760 --> 02:38:38.991
MATT: All righty. So.

02:38:38.991 --> 02:38:48.245
MARISHA: I had so much hope when we took down
their tower. It went away very quickly.

02:38:48.245 --> 02:38:51.400
TALIESIN: It did, but I think that probably made a
lot of cultists go away.

02:38:51.400 --> 02:38:54.228
LIAM: Guys, we've got to start the new campaign
sometime.

02:38:54.228 --> 02:38:58.629
MATT: Okay. Beginning of the round.

02:38:58.629 --> 02:39:03.207
MARISHA: We all die.

02:39:03.207 --> 02:39:10.535
TALIESIN: I cast Game Over. 20th-level spell.

02:39:10.535 --> 02:39:12.060
MATT: So many options.

02:39:12.060 --> 02:39:13.575
(groaning)

02:39:13.575 --> 02:39:15.115
TALIESIN: Fuck you.

02:39:15.115 --> 02:39:24.165
LIAM: We're going to die. Yep!

02:39:24.165 --> 02:39:27.874
TRAVIS: Obviously, we're not at the top of the
round.

02:39:27.874 --> 02:39:38.655
MATT: Okay, so. Vecna, as he stands there, seeing
the beholder arrive over the edge, seeing the

02:39:38.655 --> 02:39:42.862
paladin in the sky, seeing the rest of these
individuals cluster in, goes,

02:39:42.862 --> 02:39:49.398
"Very well. I wanted to talk more. Please, sit."

02:39:49.398 --> 02:40:11.581
I need Scanlan, Vax, Grog, Keyleth, and Vex 
to all make wisdom saving throws, please.

02:40:11.581 --> 02:40:12.922
TRAVIS: Fuck!

02:40:12.995 --> 02:40:15.022
MARISHA: Ugh, should have done that fucking
Feast!

02:40:15.022 --> 02:40:16.461
LAURA: We knew we were going to say it.

02:40:16.461 --> 02:40:19.704
SAM: Shit, I'm gonna lose my fucking
9th-level spell.

02:40:19.704 --> 02:40:21.725
ASHLEY: Not necessarily!

02:40:21.725 --> 02:40:23.854
MARISHA: 13.

02:40:23.854 --> 02:40:25.931
TRAVIS: Oh fuck, yeah. A natural 19.

02:40:25.931 --> 02:40:29.747
LAURA: I have a feeling I have to roll really high
against fucking Vecna!

02:40:29.747 --> 02:40:31.537
TALIESIN: Do you have a Luck?

02:40:31.537 --> 02:40:34.144
LAURA: Oh yeah, Tary had Luck, not Scanlan.

02:40:34.144 --> 02:40:39.084
SAM: Neither have Luck. I'm a beholder.

02:40:39.084 --> 02:40:40.839
TALIESIN: No, you have all of your other stuff.

02:40:40.839 --> 02:40:42.242
SAM: Are you sure about that?

02:40:42.242 --> 02:40:43.661
MARISHA: Is it like Shapechange?

02:40:43.661 --> 02:40:48.226
SAM: This is True Polymorph. I am this creature.

02:40:48.226 --> 02:40:50.507
MARISHA: Oh, it's True Polymorph.

02:40:50.507 --> 02:40:51.600
MATT: He is that creature.

02:40:51.600 --> 02:40:52.655
LIAM: That's hot.

02:40:52.655 --> 02:40:54.328
SAM: Except it's not, because I'm about to not be
anymore.

02:40:54.328 --> 02:40:56.066
LAURA: Because he's going to cancel it.

02:40:56.066 --> 02:40:57.251
MATT: So.

02:40:57.251 --> 02:40:58.816
SAM: 18.

02:40:58.816 --> 02:41:01.620
LIAM: God damn it.

02:41:01.620 --> 02:41:03.010
TRAVIS: Oh, Jesus.

02:41:03.010 --> 02:41:04.195
MARISHA: 27.

02:41:04.195 --> 02:41:05.998
MATT: You resist.

02:41:05.998 --> 02:41:07.314
LIAM: 18.

02:41:07.314 --> 02:41:09.548
LAURA: Oh god, you have to roll so high in order
to resist.

02:41:09.548 --> 02:41:12.143
SAM: Even with advantage? Oh, fuck.

02:41:12.143 --> 02:41:13.564
TRAVIS: 19.

02:41:13.564 --> 02:41:17.467
MARISHA: They roll disadvantage against you, too.

02:41:17.467 --> 02:41:21.291
TALIESIN: Oh, you didn't say me.

02:41:21.291 --> 02:41:25.013
LAURA: You skipped me. And I rolled a 20.

02:41:25.058 --> 02:41:27.904
MARISHA: You rolled a 20?

02:41:27.904 --> 02:41:36.207
MATT: You feel the force of his magical prowess
coalesce like a cold vise on your brain, and your

02:41:36.207 --> 02:41:49.228
body seizes, holding taut. And you're all held.
You fall straight down 80 feet.

02:41:49.228 --> 02:41:50.640
MARISHA: Oh, no.

02:41:50.640 --> 02:41:56.207
TRAVIS: (nervous laughter) Oh, fuck! Oh man!

02:41:56.207 --> 02:41:59.054
MARISHA: None of us can do anything to help him?

02:41:59.054 --> 02:42:03.019
LAURA: We slow-motion walked into our own death.

02:42:03.019 --> 02:42:05.083
TRAVIS: Oh, shit!

02:42:05.083 --> 02:42:06.350
SAM: Is Pike out?

02:42:06.350 --> 02:42:13.229
MATT: Take 32 points of bludgeoning damage, Vax.
And you are-- Oh god!

02:42:13.229 --> 02:42:15.142
LAURA: Walls brought down.

02:42:15.142 --> 02:42:17.659
MATT: Prone, there.

02:42:17.659 --> 02:42:19.105
MARISHA: Fucking shit.

02:42:19.105 --> 02:42:22.221
MATT: The rest of you are also held.

02:42:22.221 --> 02:42:25.244
TRAVIS: Is this charmed or frightened?

02:42:25.244 --> 02:42:27.391
MATT: No.

02:42:27.391 --> 02:42:28.886
TRAVIS: Okay, it's not.

02:42:28.886 --> 02:42:30.467
LAURA: What does being held mean?

02:42:30.467 --> 02:42:31.796
LIAM: It's paralysis.

02:42:31.796 --> 02:42:38.342
TALIESIN: Until we save, or until his
concentration is broken, I assume.

02:42:38.342 --> 02:42:39.282
MATT: Correct.

02:42:39.282 --> 02:42:40.784
TRAVIS: And rage would have no effect on this?

02:42:40.784 --> 02:42:41.727
MATT: Nope!

02:42:41.727 --> 02:42:43.245
TRAVIS: Fucking shit.

02:42:43.245 --> 02:42:54.179
MATT: And he's going to go ahead and shift up
about 20 more feet and kind of glance over the

02:42:54.179 --> 02:42:56.220
battlefield a bit.

02:42:56.220 --> 02:43:00.286
SAM: He's a god! He's a golden god!

02:43:00.286 --> 02:43:03.925
TRAVIS: He actually is one. And he won't jump off a
1000-foot cliff.

02:43:03.925 --> 02:43:07.683
MATT: (chuckles) Apparently. All right.

02:43:07.683 --> 02:43:11.703
LAURA: T minus ten minutes until he turns into a
goldfish.

02:43:11.703 --> 02:43:15.694
MARISHA: We can only be so hopeful.

02:43:15.694 --> 02:43:17.364
LAURA: That's plenty of time for us to die.

02:43:17.364 --> 02:43:19.616
MATT: That ends his turn. Delilah's now going to
go.

02:43:19.616 --> 02:43:21.105
TRAVIS and LAURA: Oh, good!

02:43:21.105 --> 02:43:23.140
TRAVIS: Wow, what a way to lead off the round!

02:43:23.140 --> 02:43:27.034
SAM: My anti-magic cone is not in effect, I
assume?

02:43:27.034 --> 02:43:31.357
TALIESIN: Actually, isn't it just naturally
wherever they're looking?

02:43:31.357 --> 02:43:34.981
MATT: It's wherever you're facing, but he hasn't
had a turn to go yet, he basically just arrived.

02:43:34.981 --> 02:43:36.762
TALIESIN: Oh, okay.

02:43:36.762 --> 02:43:45.433
MATT: So it would be kind of in this path here,
wherever you would have come in in this regard. So

02:43:45.433 --> 02:43:47.774
it would be this direction.

02:43:47.774 --> 02:43:49.945
LIAM: It's a big fuckin' headlamp.

02:43:49.945 --> 02:44:00.455
SAM: (laughs) Just frozen there. I really want to
swallow and I can't close--

02:44:00.455 --> 02:44:03.604
TALIESIN: I was under the impression that the
eyeball was passive.

02:44:03.604 --> 02:44:05.408
MATT: I'm checking right now, actually.

02:44:05.408 --> 02:44:09.426
SAM: Well, you have to choose. At the start of
each turn--

02:44:09.426 --> 02:44:12.277
MATT: At the start of its turn, which way the cone
faces and whether the cone is active.

02:44:12.277 --> 02:44:14.147
SAM: I haven't had a turn.

02:44:14.147 --> 02:44:15.923
MARISHA: And if it's active?

02:44:15.923 --> 02:44:20.198
TALIESIN: You're holding your action for being
able to move.

02:44:20.198 --> 02:44:21.720
MATT: Anyway.

02:44:21.720 --> 02:44:25.466
TRAVIS: Hey, so... (laughs)

02:44:25.513 --> 02:44:28.389
SAM: We got this, guys. How many of us are still
able to move?

02:44:28.389 --> 02:44:30.291
MATT: Three of you.

02:44:30.291 --> 02:44:31.730
SAM: Hey! Okay!

02:44:31.730 --> 02:44:35.920
TRAVIS: Looking up! Things are looking up. He has
12 hit points, by the way.

02:44:35.920 --> 02:44:37.664
MARISHA: Being held. What's the deal with that?

02:44:37.664 --> 02:44:41.936
MATT: You're paralyzed. Which means you are
incapacitated, you automatically fail strength and

02:44:41.936 --> 02:44:45.716
dexterity saving throws, attack rolls against you
have advantage, and any creature that hits you

02:44:45.716 --> 02:44:47.687
within five feet, it's a critical hit.

02:44:47.687 --> 02:44:51.572
TRAVIS: Basically worst scenario possible. That's
all you had to say: worst scenario possible.

02:44:51.572 --> 02:44:54.731
TALIESIN: It could be worse, but it would take
math. This is bad.

02:44:54.731 --> 02:44:58.878
SAM: Pike's going to solve everything.

02:44:58.878 --> 02:45:00.416
ASHLEY: Oh, yeah.

02:45:00.416 --> 02:45:01.801
SAM: Yeah, she can get us out of this.

02:45:01.801 --> 02:45:03.199
LIAM: Flipping those pages.

02:45:03.199 --> 02:45:11.542
TRAVIS: Remember this look, boys and girls. On
Matt's face. As the chef carefully

02:45:11.774 --> 02:45:14.006
picks the menu of our-- Yes.

02:45:14.006 --> 02:45:16.108
LAURA: Of our destruction? Of our doom?

02:45:16.108 --> 02:45:18.784
TALIESIN: He has been grooming us and fattening us
up for two years.

02:45:18.784 --> 02:45:20.988
MATT: Delilah is going to move.

02:45:20.988 --> 02:45:24.335
SAM: Oh no, lair action, she explodes.

02:45:24.335 --> 02:45:27.016
(laughter)

02:45:27.016 --> 02:45:35.029
MATT: And is going to step over Vax's body on the
ground.

02:45:35.029 --> 02:45:37.228
MARISHA: Oh, bitch! You better back off, bitch!

02:45:37.228 --> 02:45:39.890
LAURA: Hope you're wearing underwear, bitch,
because he just looked up your skirt!

02:45:39.890 --> 02:45:42.227
MATT: And looks at you.

02:45:42.227 --> 02:45:43.765
LAURA: (small voice) Me?

02:45:43.765 --> 02:45:45.512
MATT: It's been a while, my dear.

02:45:45.512 --> 02:45:48.881
(yelling)

02:45:48.881 --> 02:45:56.622
LAURA: No! Why would you do this?! How you do dis
Matt?!

02:45:56.622 --> 02:45:58.323
MATT: Yep, so make a constitution saving throw.

02:45:58.323 --> 02:45:59.743
LAURA: No!

02:45:59.743 --> 02:46:01.981
MATT: You're held, but you still make a
constitution roll.

02:46:01.981 --> 02:46:03.293
MARISHA: Come on...

02:46:03.293 --> 02:46:05.287
ASHLEY: Matt, how do you do this?!

02:46:05.287 --> 02:46:06.702
TRAVIS: Come on.

02:46:06.702 --> 02:46:08.051
MARISHA: Not again.

02:46:08.051 --> 02:46:09.190
LAURA: Natural 20!

02:46:09.190 --> 02:46:10.770
(cheering)

02:46:10.770 --> 02:46:12.261
MATT: No way!

02:46:12.261 --> 02:46:15.668
LIAM: And I said, biiiiitch.

02:46:15.668 --> 02:46:18.320
MATT: So you take half as much damage, which is
good.

02:46:18.320 --> 02:46:20.388
MARISHA: Oh my god.

02:46:20.388 --> 02:46:23.193
LAURA: Oh, I'm really glad we healed.

02:46:23.193 --> 02:46:30.169
LIAM: Vax on the ground just starts going
(unintelligible yells).

02:46:30.169 --> 02:46:32.729
MATT: All right, so instead of 61 points of
necrotic damage,

02:46:32.729 --> 02:46:34.390
you take 30 points of necrotic damage.

02:46:34.434 --> 02:46:35.996
LIAM: I'm shaking, guys.

02:46:35.996 --> 02:46:37.388
TALIESIN: Leroy!

02:46:37.388 --> 02:46:43.358
TRAVIS: Oh my god.

02:46:43.358 --> 02:46:46.043
LIAM: Got to squeeze my spiky dice to wake up.

02:46:46.043 --> 02:46:49.312
LAURA: Ow, ow.

02:46:49.312 --> 02:46:51.208
MATT: You okay?

02:46:51.208 --> 02:46:52.712
LAURA: (whimpering) I'm good.

02:46:52.712 --> 02:46:54.212
TRAVIS: Blood pressure's a thing right now.

02:46:54.212 --> 02:46:56.469
MATT: That'll end her turn. Grog.

02:46:56.469 --> 02:46:57.622
LIAM: Holy shit, Grog.

02:46:57.622 --> 02:46:59.872
MATT: Your turn happens at the same time the lair
action happens.

02:46:59.872 --> 02:47:01.828
TRAVIS: And the Death Knight, right?

02:47:01.828 --> 02:47:05.275
MATT: And the Death Knight. He's going to go
directly after you. You guys going on the same

02:47:05.275 --> 02:47:06.547
turn, I gave you a little bit.

02:47:06.547 --> 02:47:09.728
TALIESIN: Oh man, I am not-- This does not feel
good.

02:47:09.728 --> 02:47:11.352
TRAVIS: Oh, shit! Oh!

02:47:11.352 --> 02:47:13.504
MATT: You watch as the bodies on the ground quiver
(sound of bones cracking)

02:47:13.504 --> 02:47:15.214
And begin to rise up around you.

02:47:15.214 --> 02:47:21.562
SAM: No, forget them! Fix us! Forget them, they're
nothing. Fix us.

02:47:21.562 --> 02:47:23.220
LAURA: They could just attack us until we die.

02:47:23.220 --> 02:47:24.876
SAM: Fix. Us. They're tiny.

02:47:24.876 --> 02:47:27.813
TALIESIN: I have a plan. I have a plan.

02:47:27.813 --> 02:47:29.108
SAM: Fix us.

02:47:29.108 --> 02:47:31.573
TRAVIS: What, you're going to pledge your fealty
to the fucking--

02:47:31.573 --> 02:47:35.010
SAM: Some sort of-- I don't know, can you
restore... Restoration?

02:47:35.010 --> 02:47:36.634
LAURA: Do you have mass Restoration?

02:47:36.634 --> 02:47:37.974
ASHLEY: No!

02:47:37.974 --> 02:47:40.202
MARISHA: That's not a spell, you guys!

02:47:40.202 --> 02:47:41.463
ASHLEY: I'm useless!

02:47:41.463 --> 02:47:43.908
MARISHA: I don't know if Pike can fix this!

02:47:43.908 --> 02:47:46.321
LAURA: I don't think she can fix it.

02:47:46.321 --> 02:47:50.665
ASHLEY: Let's use it! Let's just make it, Matt,
you can put that in your new campaign book.

02:47:50.665 --> 02:47:52.324
Mass Restoration.

02:47:52.324 --> 02:47:55.142
LAURA: Mass Anti-hold.

02:47:55.142 --> 02:48:01.126
MATT: And this will be there. So they all rise up
out of the ground, these basic skeletons, and they

02:48:01.126 --> 02:48:09.587
all get one attack. So against Percy, this one
moves in. Rolls a natural one, misses entirely.

02:48:09.587 --> 02:48:15.667
One of them's going to strike at the beholder
that's up in the air; that's going to be a 15,

02:48:15.667 --> 02:48:16.917
what's your armor class?

02:48:16.917 --> 02:48:17.858
SAM: 18.

02:48:17.858 --> 02:48:23.593
MATT: 18. Just ricochets off the armor. There's
one here that's going to go toward Pike. And

02:48:23.593 --> 02:48:28.753
you're not held, right? You resisted it. So it's
going to go ahead and make a strike on you; that's

02:48:28.753 --> 02:48:36.327
another 15. Just hits your armor and scrapes off,
no effect. This one's going to rush forward, two

02:48:36.327 --> 02:48:45.155
against Vax on the ground. It has advantage.
That's a 19.

02:48:45.155 --> 02:48:46.442
LIAM: To do what?

02:48:46.442 --> 02:48:47.760
MATT: To attack you.

02:48:47.760 --> 02:48:50.643
LIAM: All right, so I'm at disadvantage, but I
have advantage, so it would be one straight roll?

02:48:50.643 --> 02:48:54.261
MATT: No, it has advantage against you because
you're paralyzed, so yeah, it would be one

02:48:54.261 --> 02:48:56.070
straight roll. The first roll was 19.

02:48:56.070 --> 02:48:57.354
LIAM: Oh, so no.

02:48:57.354 --> 02:49:00.706
MATT: No. Your armor class is 21 naturally?

02:49:00.706 --> 02:49:07.108
LIAM: It is 21 when the daggers are out, and my
daggers are in my hands. I mean, I don't know,

02:49:07.108 --> 02:49:10.241
this is kinda loosey-goosey. All right, then I'm
at 20.

02:49:10.241 --> 02:49:17.795
MATT: Yeah, so it still misses you. The other one,
no, misses. Both of them just miss you. The effect

02:49:17.795 --> 02:49:21.920
of the 9th-level spell is just enough of a
vibration that the attacks are being-- You're

02:49:21.920 --> 02:49:24.539
moving just, (grunts) ever so faintly out of the
way.

02:49:24.539 --> 02:49:25.783
LIAM: Familiar.

02:49:25.783 --> 02:49:28.742
MATT: One attacking Keyleth. That is a 24.

02:49:28.742 --> 02:49:29.957
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:49:29.957 --> 02:49:42.085
MATT: So you suffer eight points of slashing
damage. And then Vex, that is a 12 to hit? And a

02:49:42.085 --> 02:49:46.874
20 to hit. Neither hit? So as they're striking
you, they're hitting the armor, it's just not

02:49:46.874 --> 02:49:49.881
cutting through. They can't seem to get through
it. So that worked out okay in your favor.

02:49:49.881 --> 02:49:52.569
LAURA: Thanks, dragon armor!

02:49:52.569 --> 02:49:55.048
MATT: Grog? You're paralyzed.

02:49:55.048 --> 02:49:56.449
TRAVIS: Uh-huh.

02:49:56.449 --> 02:49:59.835
MATT: I believe you make another saving throw at
the end of your turn to try

02:49:59.835 --> 02:50:02.427
and shrug off the effect.

02:50:02.427 --> 02:50:05.066
TRAVIS: Can I go into a paralyzed rage?

02:50:05.066 --> 02:50:08.418
MATT: Nope. But make a wisdom saving throw.

02:50:08.418 --> 02:50:12.271
LAURA: God, we've got to roll like a 27 in order
to break it!

02:50:12.271 --> 02:50:15.223
TRAVIS: 12.

02:50:15.223 --> 02:50:17.395
MATT: Nope. You're still locked in place, unable
to move.

02:50:17.395 --> 02:50:20.350
SAM: I will never be able to break it.

02:50:20.350 --> 02:50:22.908
LAURA: A 20 didn't break it, so yeah.

02:50:22.908 --> 02:50:24.339
SAM: Yeah, there's no way.

02:50:24.339 --> 02:50:26.090
MATT: A natural 20 would break it.

02:50:26.090 --> 02:50:27.333
LAURA: A natural 20.

02:50:27.333 --> 02:50:29.429
MARISHA: A natural 20 would break it, that's the
only thing?

02:50:29.429 --> 02:50:33.217
TRAVIS: I have a modifier of zero, so.

02:50:33.217 --> 02:50:34.591
LAURA: Yeah.

02:50:34.591 --> 02:50:36.570
LIAM: Gotta fucking attack that bitch.

02:50:36.570 --> 02:50:39.497
TRAVIS: Holy shit.

02:50:39.497 --> 02:50:42.426
MATT: Actually, you know what? No. He's gonna stay
back there and move

02:50:42.426 --> 02:50:43.951
this way to get out of the way.

02:50:43.951 --> 02:50:45.616
LIAM: Fuck you, Sylas.

02:50:45.616 --> 02:50:52.404
MATT: As the Death Knight kinda steps over to the
side, you watch as this small sphere of darkness

02:50:52.404 --> 02:51:01.204
begins to (crackling sound) into his hand, and
then throws it with an arc, in a 20-foot radius

02:51:01.204 --> 02:51:04.828
centered on a point that it chooses.

02:51:04.828 --> 02:51:11.997
SAM: That's rough stuff.

02:51:11.997 --> 02:51:16.919
TRAVIS: You're a beholder, do you get legendary
actions and resistances and shit?

02:51:16.919 --> 02:51:18.148
SAM: I don't think-- I don't know.

02:51:18.148 --> 02:51:20.142
MATT: It's legendary resistances, not actions.

02:51:20.142 --> 02:51:21.926
SAM: What's a legendary resistance?

02:51:21.926 --> 02:51:24.003
MATT: You get to reroll-- Unless it doesn't have
it.

02:51:24.003 --> 02:51:25.946
SAM: This doesn't.

02:51:25.946 --> 02:51:33.346
MATT: No, the beholder does not. It's not that
powerful. All right, I need Pike, Grog--it's a

02:51:33.346 --> 02:51:36.968
dexterity saving throw. So Grog and Scanlan
automatically fail. Percival and Pike, I need you

02:51:36.968 --> 02:51:38.847
both to make dexterity saving throws, please.

02:51:38.847 --> 02:51:43.550
ASHLEY: Okay. Oh, fuck.

02:51:43.550 --> 02:51:47.949
TALIESIN: Yeah. 20.

02:51:47.949 --> 02:51:50.330
ASHLEY: (brightly) Six!

02:51:50.330 --> 02:51:53.398
LAURA: Wait! Oh, I thought that was ten.

02:51:53.398 --> 02:51:55.759
TALIESIN: I have advantage also, against--

02:51:55.759 --> 02:52:02.925
MATT: Right. You take a total of 35 points of fire
and necrotic damage. You take 35 points of

02:52:02.925 --> 02:52:07.204
necrotic damage, and because you're resistant to
fire, you only take

02:52:07.204 --> 02:52:14.668
17 points of fire damage. 35 points.

02:52:14.668 --> 02:52:20.476
ASHLEY: Did you say 17, Matt?

02:52:20.476 --> 02:52:22.241
MATT: 17, yes.

02:52:22.241 --> 02:52:28.706
MATT: Scanlan? And Grog. You both take-- Actually
no, since you have resistance to fire-- Which

02:52:28.706 --> 02:52:31.334
actually, your form is, I should give you the
large form.

02:52:31.334 --> 02:52:34.732
SAM: I added wrong. Wait, wait! Stop everything.

02:52:34.732 --> 02:52:37.015
MATT: Yes? What're you stoppin'?

02:52:37.015 --> 02:52:43.602
SAM: I added wrong. My saving throw was a 23.

02:52:43.602 --> 02:52:45.470
MATT: Was a 23?

02:52:45.470 --> 02:52:46.867
LAURA: On being held?

02:52:46.867 --> 02:52:49.236
MATT: On being held? Still fails.

02:52:49.236 --> 02:52:50.637
SAM: Oh!

02:52:50.637 --> 02:52:53.583
TRAVIS: Yeah, you did a 24, right?

02:52:53.583 --> 02:52:55.098
MARISHA: I rolled like a 27.

02:52:55.098 --> 02:52:56.271
LAURA: She rolled a 27.

02:52:56.271 --> 02:53:01.408
TRAVIS: 27, yeah. We gotta go!

02:53:01.408 --> 02:53:04.231
LAURA: There's nowhere-- We're gonna die.

02:53:04.231 --> 02:53:07.565
SAM: So what did I just get hit with? 70 points or
something?

02:53:07.565 --> 02:53:09.754
MATT: You took 70 points of fire and necrotic
damage.

02:53:09.754 --> 02:53:10.977
SAM: Awesome.

02:53:10.977 --> 02:53:12.818
TALIESIN: Do you have resistance to any of that?

02:53:12.818 --> 02:53:17.469
MATT: Not as a beholder, no. Okay, that ends the
Death Knight's turn.

02:53:17.469 --> 02:53:19.501
TRAVIS: I mean, he's just dunking on us.

02:53:19.501 --> 02:53:22.779
TALIESIN: Well, they're top-loading. They're
top-loading.

02:53:22.779 --> 02:53:25.738
MATT: Vex. Go ahead and make a wisdom saving
throw.

02:53:25.738 --> 02:53:28.739
TRAVIS: Crotch in face.

02:53:28.739 --> 02:53:33.020
MATT: That's cocked, roll again.

02:53:33.020 --> 02:53:38.161
LAURA: 21.

02:53:38.161 --> 02:53:40.431
MATT: Nope, still locked in place.

02:53:40.431 --> 02:53:42.208
TRAVIS: Oh, for the wisdom save?

02:53:42.208 --> 02:53:43.597
MATT: Pike.

02:53:43.597 --> 02:53:58.078
ASHLEY: Okay. All right, I'm going to touch Grog
and cast Lesser Restoration.

02:53:58.078 --> 02:53:59.794
MATT: Okay, which cures...?

02:53:59.794 --> 02:54:01.368
ASHLEY: Paralysis.

02:54:01.368 --> 02:54:02.727
MATT: Then, yeah.

02:54:02.727 --> 02:54:06.633
ASHLEY: Okay. So I've just got to run around.

02:54:06.633 --> 02:54:08.417
MATT: Grog, you are cured of paralysis.

02:54:08.417 --> 02:54:09.638
TRAVIS: Okay.

02:54:09.638 --> 02:54:11.318
SAM: Do that a lot.

02:54:11.318 --> 02:54:19.636
MATT: You feel your form freed of the effect of
the spell. Do you want to move?

02:54:19.636 --> 02:54:21.625
ASHLEY: How many undead are there?

02:54:21.625 --> 02:54:25.864
MATT: There are one, two, three, four, five over
there.

02:54:25.864 --> 02:54:27.083
ASHLEY: Okay.

02:54:27.083 --> 02:54:28.993
MATT: You already used your action to cast a
spell, so.

02:54:28.993 --> 02:54:34.521
ASHLEY: Yeah. So, as my bonus action, I'm going to
cast Shield of Faith on Percy.

02:54:34.521 --> 02:54:36.028
MATT: Okay.

02:54:36.028 --> 02:54:41.936
ASHLEY: Which will just add two to your AC.

02:54:41.936 --> 02:54:43.412
TALIESIN: Oh, thank you!

02:54:43.412 --> 02:54:45.081
MATT: What level is Shield of Faith?

02:54:45.081 --> 02:54:47.153
ASHLEY: First level.

02:54:47.153 --> 02:54:49.699
MATT: Okay, yeah. So there you go. Just mark that
for yourself.

02:54:49.699 --> 02:54:51.096
TALIESIN: Oh, it's on!

02:54:51.096 --> 02:54:53.085
MATT: All righty. Do you want to move, or are you
going to stay where you are, Pike?

02:54:53.085 --> 02:54:59.599
TALIESIN: You've got a Death Knight, if you're
feeling frisky.

02:54:59.599 --> 02:55:01.711
TRAVIS: Do you want to move or stay where you
are?

02:55:01.711 --> 02:55:10.403
ASHLEY: Okay. Sorry. I'm going to hide behind the
beholder.

02:55:10.403 --> 02:55:19.701
MATT: Okay, so you move around Grog and get right
about there. That ends your turn, Pike. Vax, make

02:55:19.701 --> 02:55:21.078
a wisdom saving throw.

02:55:21.078 --> 02:55:22.790
LIAM: I'm going to attempt to roll a natural 20.

02:55:22.790 --> 02:55:24.131
MARISHA: You have advantage on everything.

02:55:24.131 --> 02:55:25.135
LIAM: I know.

02:55:25.135 --> 02:55:26.434
MARISHA: That's good. That's okay.

02:55:26.434 --> 02:55:29.777
LIAM: It's not a natural 20, though, which is what
it's going to take. I'm going to use Luck.

02:55:29.777 --> 02:55:31.350
MARISHA: Oh my god, you rolled a 19.

02:55:31.350 --> 02:55:32.843
LIAM: 18 and a 19.

02:55:32.843 --> 02:55:34.317
SAM: Plus anything?

02:55:34.317 --> 02:55:40.515
LIAM: Plus two. Gets me to 21. I need a natural 20.
Luck. No. Okay.

02:55:40.515 --> 02:55:44.771
MATT: That ends your turn, Vax. Percival.

02:55:44.771 --> 02:55:51.096
TALIESIN: I'm going to scoot against the wall
towards myself as far as a reasonable amount of

02:55:51.096 --> 02:55:56.850
movement will take me because I don't like
clumping. I'm going to take aim at the asshole in

02:55:56.850 --> 02:56:10.041
the sky, and let's do a couple of things. I'm
going to take Bad News out, and just to keep

02:56:10.041 --> 02:56:20.390
everything reasonable, I'm going to burn a point
for dead-eye, and I'm going to take a sharpshooter

02:56:20.390 --> 02:56:21.811
shot on him.

02:56:21.811 --> 02:56:24.089
MATT: Okay, so minus five to the attack roll.

02:56:24.089 --> 02:56:32.951
TALIESIN: Minus five to the attack. That's a crit!
That's a crit.

02:56:32.951 --> 02:56:35.674
MATT: You rolled a 19, yeah, which you have now at
level 18.

02:56:35.674 --> 02:56:37.248
TALIESIN: At level 18, that's a crit.

02:56:37.248 --> 02:56:42.852
MATT: This is with which gun?

02:56:42.852 --> 02:56:51.335
TALIESIN: This is with Bad News, so that's going
to be 2d12. That's going to be 4d12 plus six.

02:56:51.335 --> 02:56:53.378
MATT: This is Bad News, you said?

02:56:53.378 --> 02:56:58.138
TALIESIN: Bad News. I don't know if this also
doubles-- I don't think it does-- but I'm pouring

02:56:58.138 --> 02:57:00.403
all of Cabal's Ruin into this shit, too.

02:57:00.403 --> 02:57:07.014
MATT: Go ahead and roll the Cabal's Ruin damage.
The actual hit from Bad News does nothing.

02:57:07.014 --> 02:57:08.477
TALIESIN: Oh, really?

02:57:08.477 --> 02:57:18.341
MATT: The non-enchanted attack from Bad News hits
and dissipates across his form. It's not half

02:57:18.341 --> 02:57:23.897
damage. Nothing. This is Vecna. Cabal's Ruin is
considered magical damage,

02:57:23.897 --> 02:57:25.470
so that will go through.

02:57:25.470 --> 02:57:29.931
MARISHA: Was that the one you critted on?

02:57:29.931 --> 02:57:32.304
TALIESIN: Yeah, I burned a crit.

02:57:32.304 --> 02:57:36.977
MATT: You gained the grit back, though.

02:57:36.977 --> 02:57:43.171
TALIESIN: The grit's not burned, so that's nice.
These don't double, do they?

02:57:43.171 --> 02:57:48.567
MATT: No. Wait, technically, they would.
Technically, they do, because it is a crit. All

02:57:48.567 --> 02:57:49.951
dice double, yeah.

02:57:49.951 --> 02:57:51.510
ASHLEY: Get him!

02:57:51.510 --> 02:57:59.397
TALIESIN: Does my other rule also apply to this?
Does this add to bleed damage now? Maybe not.

02:57:59.397 --> 02:58:01.811
MATT: I don't think so, because it's an outside
effect.

02:58:01.811 --> 02:58:05.512
TALIESIN: It's an outside factor. That's fine. I'm
with you.

02:58:05.512 --> 02:58:10.742
MATT: No, you know what? It would because just
like any other critical effect, yes, it would.

02:58:10.742 --> 02:58:12.022
TALIESIN: Okay.

02:58:12.022 --> 02:58:13.355
MATT: It would.

02:58:13.355 --> 02:58:18.447
TALIESIN: (counting) 32. That's 32.

02:58:18.447 --> 02:58:34.244
MARISHA: Did you count that one?

02:58:34.244 --> 02:58:38.686
TALIESIN: 36 points of damage, times two.

02:58:38.686 --> 02:58:41.410
LAURA: 72.

02:58:41.410 --> 02:58:42.852
MATT: 72.

02:58:42.852 --> 02:58:50.956
TALIESIN: 72 points of electrical damage, and then
he's also going to get a bleed of 31. No, he's

02:58:50.956 --> 02:58:52.797
going to get a bleed of 15.

02:58:52.797 --> 02:58:57.948
MATT: He will get 15 because he's resistant to
lightning, so he takes half of that next time.

02:58:57.948 --> 02:59:03.873
TALIESIN: But he still has to roll concentration.

02:59:03.873 --> 02:59:05.465
MATT: Yeah, for 36.

02:59:05.465 --> 02:59:14.401
TALIESIN: I'll take it, and goodbye, Cabal. I'll
gain more when he hits me with some magic shit.

02:59:14.401 --> 02:59:18.701
SAM: Oh boy.

02:59:18.701 --> 02:59:25.490
LAURA: It's such an anti-climactic fight because
none of us can do anything.

02:59:25.490 --> 02:59:39.086
MATT: That would be 18 as half that. DC is 18 to
maintain concentration. Yeah, he saves.

02:59:39.086 --> 02:59:40.701
TALIESIN: God fucking damn it!

02:59:40.701 --> 02:59:42.129
MATT: Barely. By one.

02:59:42.129 --> 02:59:43.348
TRAVIS: By one?

02:59:43.348 --> 02:59:44.665
MATT: By one.

02:59:44.665 --> 02:59:45.931
LAURA: On concentration?

02:59:45.931 --> 02:59:49.502
TALIESIN: Damn it. I was debating whether or not
to hit him with Hex, and now I'm so sad I didn't.

02:59:49.502 --> 03:00:07.044
Oh, well. That's okay. I'm reloading, and I'm
going to take another Bad News shot at Delilah.

03:00:07.044 --> 03:00:09.103
Where is she?

03:00:09.103 --> 03:00:10.194
MATT: She's over here.

03:00:10.194 --> 03:00:11.598
TALIESIN: What is she doing?

03:00:11.598 --> 03:00:15.670
MATT: She just stepped over Vax's paralyzed body
and threw a Finger of Death at Vex.

03:00:15.670 --> 03:00:26.631
TALIESIN: Okay. Let's burn that little bit of
Animus again and burn that grit point again for

03:00:26.631 --> 03:00:41.515
advantage. Let's hit her with Bad News. Actually,
I'll cast... Hex on her, as well, just for fun.

03:00:41.515 --> 03:00:43.213
MATT: Okay.

03:00:43.213 --> 03:00:51.339
TALIESIN: And give her constitution disadvantage.
Actually, let's give her, just in case she gets

03:00:51.339 --> 03:00:54.505
grappled-- let's make it constitution
disadvantage. Fuck it.

03:00:54.505 --> 03:00:55.623
MATT: Okay.

03:00:55.623 --> 03:01:04.306
TALIESIN: And then I've got bonus, and I'm doing
sharpshooter again. Thank god I did because that

03:01:04.306 --> 03:01:09.439
was a terrible shot. That's 14.

03:01:09.439 --> 03:01:12.236
MATT: 14 does not hit, unfortunately. As you go to
fire--

03:01:12.236 --> 03:01:14.840
ASHLEY: Do we know what would hit?

03:01:14.840 --> 03:01:17.640
TALIESIN: We don't.

03:01:17.640 --> 03:01:22.562
ASHLEY: War God's Blessing to add ten?

03:01:22.562 --> 03:01:23.736
MATT: Gives a plus ten?

03:01:23.736 --> 03:01:25.764
TALIESIN: Oh, that would definitely hit, I'd
imagine.

03:01:25.764 --> 03:01:30.065
MATT: You use War God's Blessing as a reaction
onto Percy. As you go to fire, you feel the

03:01:30.065 --> 03:01:33.985
presence of Sarenrae coalesce around the blade,
and you hear a little whisper over your shoulder

03:01:33.985 --> 03:01:39.833
say, "There." And all of a sudden, clarity comes
into frame and (gunshot) you fire Bad News towards

03:01:39.833 --> 03:01:44.725
Delilah. Go ahead and roll damage on that. She's
not even going to spend a Shield on that.

03:01:44.725 --> 03:01:46.653
It's way over her AC.

03:01:46.653 --> 03:02:01.926
TALIESIN: Not bad. That's (counting) 20 points of
piercing damage and

03:02:01.926 --> 03:02:04.434
five points of necrotic damage.

03:02:04.434 --> 03:02:11.331
MATT: (gunshot) It blasts, and you see the robe
tear open on one side.

03:02:11.331 --> 03:02:15.093
She's like (cries out, breathes heavily).

03:02:15.093 --> 03:02:18.079
TALIESIN: That's my roll.

03:02:18.079 --> 03:02:24.696
MATT: You glance over with the scope and see as
she turns and looks at you. You can see, what you

03:02:24.696 --> 03:02:31.395
didn't see earlier, is one normal eye she has and
one yellowish-green eye with a cat-slit pupil.

03:02:31.395 --> 03:02:33.336
TALIESIN: Shit.

03:02:33.336 --> 03:02:35.589
LAURA: What does that even mean?

03:02:35.589 --> 03:02:40.859
TALIESIN: Vecna's been busy. Okay. This is going
to get interesting.

03:02:40.859 --> 03:02:42.698
MATT: All right, that ends your turn, Percy.

03:02:42.698 --> 03:02:44.524
TALIESIN: That's all I can do.

03:02:44.524 --> 03:02:46.719
MATT: Scanlan, go ahead and make a wisdom saving
throw.

03:02:46.719 --> 03:02:47.641
SAM: Nope.

03:02:47.641 --> 03:02:49.105
MATT: Okay.

03:02:49.105 --> 03:02:53.433
SAM: I can't move my eyes or anything or turn on
my anti-magic?

03:02:53.433 --> 03:03:03.805
MATT: As far as the ray that you have, the eye
perspective, you're hitting right there, so you're

03:03:03.805 --> 03:03:16.751
just out of range to get rid of the paralysis from
Vex and off Vax. If you manage to break from this

03:03:16.751 --> 03:03:20.461
somehow and you rotate, the spell would have no
effect while it's on them.

03:03:20.461 --> 03:03:27.367
MARISHA: They're broken from it by being in his
gaze? Am I in his gaze?

03:03:27.367 --> 03:03:29.277
MATT: No, you are not.

03:03:29.277 --> 03:03:34.857
MARISHA: So I can still cast spells. But if I move
into his gaze, I cannot.

03:03:34.857 --> 03:03:38.697
MATT: Correct. Or if you shoot something through
the cone, it will dissipate.

03:03:38.697 --> 03:03:41.416
MARISHA: If I shoot up at Vecna, will it go
through the cone?

03:03:41.416 --> 03:03:44.848
MATT: Yeah, probably. You're just outside of it.

03:03:44.848 --> 03:03:46.760
MARISHA: I will not go through the cone?

03:03:46.760 --> 03:03:52.671
MATT: Probably. You can angle it that way, yeah.
Keyleth, what are you doing?

03:03:52.671 --> 03:03:54.301
MARISHA: It is now my turn.

03:03:54.301 --> 03:03:58.458
MATT: Also, I need you to make a concentration
check.

03:03:58.458 --> 03:04:01.299
SAM: Oh, my spell.

03:04:01.299 --> 03:04:02.834
MATT: Yeah, transformation.

03:04:02.834 --> 03:04:06.359
SAM: I get advantage as a gnome.

03:04:06.359 --> 03:04:11.857
MATT: You do. How much damage did you take on that
one, total, from the blast? From the blast that

03:04:11.857 --> 03:04:14.226
you took on that.

03:04:14.226 --> 03:04:15.411
SAM: 70 points.

03:04:15.411 --> 03:04:17.736
MATT: You have to beat a 35.

03:04:17.736 --> 03:04:20.585
SAM: Okay. As a wisdom?

03:04:20.585 --> 03:04:24.131
MATT: That would have been concentration.
Constitution saving throw.

03:04:24.131 --> 03:04:26.000
SAM: Constitution saving throw.

03:04:26.000 --> 03:04:33.254
MATT: In theory, Scanlan, before it came to your
turn, you dropped your beholder form.

03:04:33.254 --> 03:04:35.790
SAM: Oh! I'm no longer paralyzed.

03:04:35.790 --> 03:04:38.951
MATT: The spell maintains itself.

03:04:38.951 --> 03:04:41.260
SAM: No! But I'm a different guy!

03:04:41.260 --> 03:04:43.776
MATT: It's your mind it affects.

03:04:43.776 --> 03:04:45.601
MARISHA: Why?

03:04:45.601 --> 03:04:50.772
MATT: Any spell still carries over the effects on
you. You can't wild shape and--

03:04:50.772 --> 03:04:52.452
MARISHA: He lost concentration?

03:04:52.452 --> 03:04:54.529
MATT: He lost concentration on his big spell,
yeah.

03:04:54.529 --> 03:04:57.919
SAM: Hey, guys.

03:04:57.919 --> 03:04:59.515
LAURA: Hey, Scanlan!

03:04:59.515 --> 03:05:04.418
MATT: I'll let you remake that saving throw with
your constitution. Sorry, your wisdom. With

03:05:04.418 --> 03:05:05.984
Scanlan's wisdom.

03:05:05.984 --> 03:05:09.962
SAM: Okay, do I get advantage because of magic?

03:05:09.962 --> 03:05:13.846
MATT: Yes, because it is magic.

03:05:13.846 --> 03:05:17.065
SAM: And can I inspire myself?

03:05:17.065 --> 03:05:18.172
MATT: Yes, you can.

03:05:18.172 --> 03:05:25.273
SAM: All right. I will inspire myself. 24.

03:05:25.273 --> 03:05:26.702
MATT: 24 is just enough.

03:05:26.702 --> 03:05:30.982
(relieved laughter)

03:05:30.982 --> 03:05:34.613
MATT: You shrug off the paralysis at the end of
your turn. You're now free to move.

03:05:34.613 --> 03:05:37.906
SAM: Just move. I can't act, right?

03:05:37.906 --> 03:05:42.285
MATT: No, that's the end of your turn. Keyleth,
what are you doing?

03:05:42.285 --> 03:05:45.152
MARISHA: Is he 60 feet away from me? Is he within
range?

03:05:45.152 --> 03:05:47.028
MATT: Who?

03:05:47.028 --> 03:05:49.349
MARISHA: Should I handle Delilah, or should I
handle him?

03:05:49.349 --> 03:05:53.594
TRAVIS: What're you doing? Which one do you want?

03:05:53.594 --> 03:05:56.062
SAM: I can move now, or just in general?

03:05:56.062 --> 03:05:57.932
MATT: No, next turn you'll be able to move.

03:05:57.932 --> 03:06:00.711
MARISHA: Is he within 60 feet of me? Vecna.

03:06:00.711 --> 03:06:03.283
MATT: You're not sure. You'd have to eyeball it.

03:06:03.283 --> 03:06:13.558
MARISHA: (counting) He's exactly 60 feet in the
air. I have to get directly under his butthole.

03:06:13.558 --> 03:06:15.373
Can I get directly under his butthole?

03:06:15.373 --> 03:06:19.000
MATT: You can move through Trinket. You'll get two
attacks of opportunity from two skeletons.

03:06:19.000 --> 03:06:22.882
MARISHA: Jesus, balls.

03:06:22.882 --> 03:06:24.533
LIAM: Jesus balls.

03:06:24.533 --> 03:06:27.252
MATT: You'd have to leapfrog over Trinket to get
there, but you can do it.

03:06:27.252 --> 03:06:32.827
MARISHA: What about Delilah. Where is she?

03:06:32.827 --> 03:06:36.258
MATT: Delilah's over here. She and two skeletons
right now are lording over

03:06:36.258 --> 03:06:38.345
the paralyzed Vax on the ground.

03:06:38.345 --> 03:06:46.572
MARISHA: If I move at all, I'm going to take
opportunity from skeletons.

03:06:46.572 --> 03:06:50.145
MATT: Yep. They don't do a whole lot of damage,
but damage adds up.

03:06:50.145 --> 03:07:03.878
MARISHA: Jesus. Okay, I am going to head to
Delilah. I can move up to her, correct?

03:07:03.878 --> 03:07:06.628
MATT: You're going to move straight up to her?

03:07:06.628 --> 03:07:07.761
MARISHA: Can I?

03:07:07.761 --> 03:07:17.231
MATT: You can, yeah. Both skeletons get attacks of
opportunity on you. That's a nine and a 12. They

03:07:17.231 --> 03:07:24.383
both hit you, but the mantle writhes out in front
of you. You watch as various leaves unfurl almost

03:07:24.383 --> 03:07:27.606
like a cat's fur on the back of its neck, and it
deflects the blows

03:07:27.606 --> 03:07:29.832
from the skeletons as you rush past.

03:07:29.832 --> 03:07:39.860
MARISHA: I can give her disadvantage on
constitution checks, and whenever she takes

03:07:39.860 --> 03:07:42.451
damage, she's stunned, or should I do the
confusion thing?

03:07:42.451 --> 03:07:46.533
TALIESIN: Either one. They're both good. Go for
the first one. Pick one.

03:07:46.533 --> 03:07:52.750
MARISHA: I'm turning into Ashley Johnson. Okay.

03:07:52.750 --> 03:07:54.039
ASHLEY: Okay!

03:07:54.039 --> 03:08:12.656
MARISHA: I'm going to go up to Delilah. (pants)
Cotton mouth. Oh boy. Yeah. Okay, I'm going to go

03:08:12.656 --> 03:08:20.063
up to her and be like, experience what you've been
putting all of us through. And I'm going to touch

03:08:20.063 --> 03:08:25.385
her and I'm going to try and cast Contagion on her
with Mind Fire?

03:08:25.385 --> 03:08:28.017
MATT: Okay.

03:08:28.017 --> 03:08:29.671
LAURA: Mind Fire!

03:08:29.671 --> 03:08:33.143
LIAM: Sounds good.

03:08:33.143 --> 03:08:35.999
TALIESIN: Hit her with a mind bullet.

03:08:35.999 --> 03:08:38.500
TRAVIS: Mind bullets!

03:08:38.500 --> 03:08:40.971
TALIESIN and MARISHA: That's telekinesis, Kyle!

03:08:40.971 --> 03:08:44.187
TRAVIS, TALIESIN, and MARISHA: (singing) How about
the power to move you?

03:08:44.187 --> 03:08:46.781
MATT: Make a melee spell attack.

03:08:46.781 --> 03:08:50.370
MARISHA: I have a bonus to my spell attacks.

03:08:50.370 --> 03:08:55.503
LAURA: You've got this!

03:08:55.503 --> 03:09:08.398
MARISHA: It's cocked. That's even worse. Not
great. 18?

03:09:08.398 --> 03:09:12.065
MATT: 18 is exactly what you needed. That's her
armor class.

03:09:12.065 --> 03:09:15.499
LIAM: (singing) We'll fucking lead as two kings!

03:09:15.499 --> 03:09:19.665
TRAVIS: (laughing) Tenacious D for the rest
of this fight, please.

03:09:19.665 --> 03:09:22.211
MATT: She now is affected by Mind Fire.

03:09:22.211 --> 03:09:26.116
MARISHA: Her mind becomes feverish, and she has
disadvantage on intelligence checks and

03:09:26.116 --> 03:09:29.330
intelligence saving throws, and she becomes
confused.

03:09:29.330 --> 03:09:32.337
SAM: What does that mean? What does confused
mean?

03:09:32.337 --> 03:09:33.872
MARISHA: For seven days.

03:09:33.872 --> 03:09:36.002
LIAM: It sounds like she can't cast spells too
well.

03:09:36.002 --> 03:09:37.444
MARISHA: Hopefully.

03:09:37.444 --> 03:09:44.483
MATT: She's now considered confused. She's under
the effects of the Confusion spell

03:09:44.483 --> 03:09:46.072
for as long as it lasts.

03:09:46.072 --> 03:09:48.607
TALIESIN: That's me under the effects of being
confused about the Confusion spell.

03:09:48.607 --> 03:09:50.463
MATT: Does that end your turn, Keyleth?

03:09:50.463 --> 03:09:53.838
TALIESIN: What do you have for a bonus?

03:09:53.838 --> 03:10:01.111
MARISHA: I don't have a lot for a bonus. I can go
into an elemental form.

03:10:01.111 --> 03:10:05.476
TRAVIS: If we attack her, is that going to drop
the confusion?

03:10:05.476 --> 03:10:07.229
TALIESIN: Yeah, can we attack her?

03:10:07.229 --> 03:10:10.212
MARISHA: No, it just lasts for seven days.

03:10:10.212 --> 03:10:14.272
MATT: It lasts for seven days if she fails the
saves. She has three saves in a row, and if she

03:10:14.272 --> 03:10:17.167
succeeds, it goes away. If she fails, it lasts for
seven days.

03:10:17.167 --> 03:10:26.773
MARISHA: Okay. She has to make constitution saving
throws. But she's under the effects right now,

03:10:26.773 --> 03:10:31.337
correct? We've been through this before, haven't
we?

03:10:31.337 --> 03:10:35.157
LAURA: Oh, yeah. This is one of the ones we tried
a long time ago.

03:10:35.157 --> 03:10:41.437
MARISHA: It says after failing three of these
saving throws, the disease effects last for the

03:10:41.437 --> 03:10:45.924
duration, so that would make me assume that she
has it at least for three rounds.

03:10:45.924 --> 03:10:53.151
MATT: We had this discussion before, because in
the ability, it has Slimy Doom, which whenever it

03:10:53.151 --> 03:10:56.237
takes damage, it becomes stunned, which is the
most broken--

03:10:56.237 --> 03:10:58.007
MARISHA: I almost did that.

03:10:58.007 --> 03:11:01.517
MATT: I know, but I think the DND ruling,
technically, they have to

03:11:01.517 --> 03:11:03.314
fail three saves before it affects them.

03:11:03.314 --> 03:11:05.701
MARISHA: But it's a 5th-level fucking spell.
That's a lot!

03:11:05.701 --> 03:11:07.032
MATT: I know.

03:11:07.032 --> 03:11:11.110
MARISHA: That's lame. Three rounds for a 5th-level
spell?

03:11:11.110 --> 03:11:14.618
MATT: Look. I'll say this. I'll let Mind Fire work
on her for now.

03:11:14.618 --> 03:11:19.440
MARISHA: Oh, he doesn't look happy. I feel like I
just pissed off the DM.

03:11:19.440 --> 03:11:23.980
MATT: No, you didn't piss off the DM. This spell
has a lot of contention in the community, but the

03:11:23.980 --> 03:11:27.300
official DND ruling was it doesn't affect until
they fail all three rolls, but as it's written, it

03:11:27.300 --> 03:11:31.241
doesn't say that. It says they're afflicted on
being hit, so I'm letting it go through because

03:11:31.241 --> 03:11:33.860
you didn't choose the cheesy-ass stun-lock broken
spell.

03:11:33.860 --> 03:11:36.670
MARISHA: It does say that after succeeding on three of
these, the creature &lt;i&gt;recovers&lt;/i&gt; from the disease,

03:11:36.744 --> 03:11:39.753
so they were already affected.

03:11:39.753 --> 03:11:45.711
MATT: Which is what I'm saying. This is between
what's written in the spell and the arguments that

03:11:45.711 --> 03:11:49.559
people have made with DND on Twitter, and they
clarified that's not how it works. It's a

03:11:49.559 --> 03:11:54.269
mis-type. It wasn't clear. I'm letting it work. Be
happy with the book.

03:11:54.269 --> 03:11:59.675
LAURA: Stop making eye contact. Look down!

03:11:59.675 --> 03:12:06.414
MATT: At the end of your turn, Vecna's going to
use some legendary actions to cast a spell.

03:12:06.414 --> 03:12:08.462
(groaning)

03:12:08.462 --> 03:12:10.963
TRAVIS: How about you just say he did, and 
don't?

03:12:10.963 --> 03:12:13.312
ASHLEY: Yeah. Let's not and say we did.

03:12:13.312 --> 03:12:16.230
LIAM: He could just evil monologue a little bit,
tell us his plan?

03:12:16.230 --> 03:12:18.119
LAURA: He's really good at evil monologuing.

03:12:18.119 --> 03:12:19.904
TALIESIN: We were talking about how much you
wanted a monologue.

03:12:19.904 --> 03:12:21.723
I really feel like this is the moment.

03:12:21.723 --> 03:12:26.506
MATT: He's going to cast a 7th-level Fireball
right there.

03:12:26.506 --> 03:12:30.142
TRAVIS: 7th-level Fireball?

03:12:30.142 --> 03:12:32.283
TALIESIN: That's the end of Vax.

03:12:32.283 --> 03:12:34.788
TRAVIS: We've got to go.

03:12:34.788 --> 03:12:40.480
MATT: I need Keyleth, Vax-- you don't auto-save,
yeah.

03:12:40.480 --> 03:12:41.873
LIAM: Good night.

03:12:41.873 --> 03:12:47.630
TRAVIS: Maybe the Raven Queen will use you or
something.

03:12:47.630 --> 03:12:50.891
LIAM: I can't. It's an automatic fail because I'm
paralyzed.

03:12:50.891 --> 03:12:52.483
MATT: Yeah.

03:12:52.483 --> 03:13:00.685
SAM: That's actually good. He'll lose the
paralysis because he'll be in a coma. We'll just

03:13:00.685 --> 03:13:03.428
wake you back up and you'll be fine. It's actually
kind of good.

03:13:03.428 --> 03:13:06.416
MATT: Keyleth, I need you to make a dexterity
saving throw, please.

03:13:06.416 --> 03:13:09.292
The skeletons are obliterated.

03:13:09.292 --> 03:13:14.240
MARISHA: That's a natural one.

03:13:14.240 --> 03:13:18.164
TRAVIS: Are you serious?! Are you serious?

03:13:18.164 --> 03:13:19.895
TALIESIN: I'm looking at it.

03:13:19.895 --> 03:13:27.835
MATT: That's a surprisingly shitty roll. 38 points
of fire damage to Vax. 38.

03:13:27.835 --> 03:13:30.004
TRAVIS: On a 7th-level Fireball?

03:13:30.004 --> 03:13:31.539
MATT: I know. I rolled really shitty.

03:13:31.539 --> 03:13:32.935
MARISHA: 38?

03:13:32.935 --> 03:13:38.797
MATT: 38 to you, as well. 38 to Vex. And 38 to
Trinket.

03:13:38.797 --> 03:13:47.148
TALIESIN: That's a small-- that's a dire
armadillo. That's okay.

03:13:47.148 --> 03:13:53.614
LAURA: 38 to Trinket?

03:13:53.614 --> 03:13:55.839
TRAVIS: Did Delilah take all that damage, too?

03:13:55.839 --> 03:14:05.135
MATT: Delilah? Yeah, she did. She can't save
against his shit. She takes it and (grunts).

03:14:05.135 --> 03:14:08.085
LIAM: She probably kind of likes it.

03:14:08.085 --> 03:14:10.231
LAURA: She's like, ooh.

03:14:10.231 --> 03:14:12.241
TALIESIN: Burn. Sick burn.

03:14:12.241 --> 03:14:18.317
MATT: It made sense for the circumstance. She's up
for the sacrifice. All righty, that ends Keyleth's

03:14:18.317 --> 03:14:21.381
turn. Top of the round. Now it's Vecna's go.

03:14:21.381 --> 03:14:23.842
TRAVIS: I thought that &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; Vecna's go.

03:14:23.842 --> 03:14:25.677
LAURA: That was his legendary.

03:14:25.677 --> 03:14:28.273
TRAVIS: Oh god.

03:14:28.273 --> 03:14:34.252
LAURA: I like that you have an enlarged figure
Grog. That's cool.

03:14:34.252 --> 03:14:37.077
TRAVIS: I thought you were complimenting the DM. I
was like, yeah, keep it up.

03:14:37.077 --> 03:14:39.652
LAURA: I like that you made an enlarged figure for
Grog.

03:14:39.652 --> 03:14:42.302
SAM: I'll kill you last.

03:14:42.302 --> 03:14:44.627
LAURA: Oh my god, this map is so pretty.

03:14:44.627 --> 03:14:49.121
(laughter)

03:14:49.121 --> 03:14:51.139
SAM: What is that thing in the middle of the
field?

03:14:51.139 --> 03:14:52.367
MATT: This is the altar.

03:14:52.367 --> 03:14:53.953
LAURA: Whatever it is, it's really cool.

03:14:53.953 --> 03:14:55.836
ASHLEY: Can we see what's in it?

03:14:55.836 --> 03:14:58.656
MATT: You'd have to go check it out, if there was
anything.

03:14:58.656 --> 03:15:00.463
MARISHA: Is he moving towards the altar?

03:15:00.463 --> 03:15:11.377
MATT: He's shifting in the center and looking down
for a bit. He goes, "Well, sleep."

03:15:11.377 --> 03:15:16.656
TALIESIN: Can he do that with concentration?

03:15:16.656 --> 03:15:20.405
MATT: This is not a concentration spell.

03:15:20.405 --> 03:15:25.665
LAURA: Magic can't put me to sleep.

03:15:25.665 --> 03:15:27.751
MATT: He casts Power Word Kill.

03:15:27.751 --> 03:15:29.586
SAM: Oh. Well, that's different.

03:15:29.586 --> 03:15:31.217
LIAM: Where did Sleep go?

03:15:31.217 --> 03:15:32.480
MATT: That's just what he said.

03:15:32.480 --> 03:15:34.891
SAM: He meant metaphorical. He meant death.

03:15:34.891 --> 03:15:37.458
MATT: You utter a word of power that can compel
one creature you see within range to die

03:15:37.458 --> 03:15:41.668
instantly. If the creature you chose has 100 hit
points or fewer, it dies.

03:15:41.668 --> 03:15:43.265
How many hit points do you have?

03:15:43.265 --> 03:15:45.608
LAURA: I'm dead. Insta-full death?

03:15:45.608 --> 03:15:47.242
MATT: Insta-full death.

03:15:47.242 --> 03:15:48.613
MARISHA: No saving from it?

03:15:48.613 --> 03:15:49.744
MATT: No.

03:15:49.744 --> 03:15:51.144
ASHLEY: Wait, what?

03:15:51.144 --> 03:15:52.251
TALIESIN: What?

03:15:52.251 --> 03:15:53.484
SAM: Perma-death?

03:15:53.484 --> 03:15:56.647
MATT: No death saving throws. You watch as the
life suddenly fades from Vex's eyes,

03:15:56.647 --> 03:15:58.468
and she falls to the ground.

03:15:58.468 --> 03:16:05.269
LIAM: Vax is watching, frozen.

03:16:05.269 --> 03:16:06.833
TRAVIS: Oh my god.

03:16:06.833 --> 03:16:11.328
LAURA: Hey, don't compliment the map, you guys.
Matt really doesn't like it.

03:16:11.328 --> 03:16:16.953
MATT: I'm sorry. It's now Delilah's turn.

03:16:16.953 --> 03:16:18.798
TALIESIN: This is not going well.

03:16:18.798 --> 03:16:20.214
SAM: Maybe we should leave.

03:16:20.214 --> 03:16:21.547
TRAVIS: Plane Shift?

03:16:21.547 --> 03:16:27.129
MATT: She turns and looks at you, Keyleth, and
goes--

03:16:27.129 --> 03:16:28.801
SAM: Is this Delilah?

03:16:28.801 --> 03:16:37.025
MATT: This is Delilah. "You took him from me. Now
I'm going to take him from you." She points down.

03:16:37.025 --> 03:16:39.222
SAM: I thought she was confused.

03:16:39.222 --> 03:16:42.535
MATT: I have to check what she does now. This may
make the change.

03:16:42.535 --> 03:16:48.264
LIAM: Well, we weren't technically dating when we
killed her, so I'm not really sure if she'd know.

03:16:48.264 --> 03:16:52.447
MATT: I get to roll a d10.

03:16:52.447 --> 03:16:55.557
MARISHA: Let's hope he doesn't roll a nine or a
ten, y'all.

03:16:55.557 --> 03:16:56.630
MATT: A ten.

03:16:56.630 --> 03:16:59.855
MARISHA: You are fucking lying to me! (groans)

03:16:59.855 --> 03:17:03.477
MATT: It's right there.

03:17:03.477 --> 03:17:06.473
TRAVIS: Yeah, I see it.

03:17:06.473 --> 03:17:09.110
TALIESIN: Oh shit. Wow, you really went down.

03:17:09.110 --> 03:17:15.097
MATT: I'm sorry. I'm rolling really well. I'm
sorry, guys.

03:17:15.241 --> 03:17:17.688
LIAM: Yeah, but that Fireball was super low.

03:17:17.688 --> 03:17:25.426
MATT: All right, so do I have to roll for an
attack on this? Creature has to make a dexterity

03:17:25.426 --> 03:17:33.506
saving throw. Hold on.

03:17:33.506 --> 03:17:37.845
TALIESIN: I don't know what to do.

03:17:37.845 --> 03:17:41.869
MATT: That's 76 points of damage from the
Disintegrate spell.

03:17:41.869 --> 03:17:45.261
LIAM: Halved from the Deathwalker's Ward. It's set
to necromantic.

03:17:45.261 --> 03:17:49.263
MATT: It's force damage. Disintegrate's force
damage.

03:17:49.263 --> 03:17:51.543
LIAM: Oh. Well, then I'm down.

03:17:51.543 --> 03:17:55.160
MARISHA: No, that means he's disintegrated.

03:17:55.160 --> 03:18:01.299
MATT: You watch as Vax's form (fluttering noise)
turns to dust.

03:18:01.299 --> 03:18:03.213
SAM: Wait, what?

03:18:03.213 --> 03:18:09.459
MATT: Leaving the armor of the Raven Queen empty
on the ground, the daggers (clattering).

03:18:09.459 --> 03:18:11.189
LAURA: No body left?

03:18:11.189 --> 03:18:12.960
MARISHA: There's no recovering from that, dude.

03:18:12.960 --> 03:18:15.061
LAURA: Bro. We're gone.

03:18:15.061 --> 03:18:16.871
TALIESIN: Wow.

03:18:16.871 --> 03:18:21.080
MATT: Grog, it's your turn.

03:18:21.080 --> 03:18:23.513
SAM: What's happening?

03:18:23.513 --> 03:18:28.819
LAURA: I thought this campaign was going to last
longer than this.

03:18:28.819 --> 03:18:32.949
LIAM: I said this was the last episode, and I
meant it.

03:18:32.949 --> 03:18:36.850
TALIESIN: You are a terrible person. Oh no.

03:18:36.850 --> 03:18:43.066
SAM: With Foresight? Oh, because you're paralyzed.
Oh fuck.

03:18:43.066 --> 03:18:45.825
MARISHA: She doesn't have to roll against that?

03:18:45.825 --> 03:18:49.812
MATT: It's a dexterity saving throw, but he's
still paralyzed.

03:18:49.812 --> 03:18:51.754
MARISHA: He doesn't get advantage?

03:18:51.754 --> 03:18:54.701
MATT: You automatically fail dex saving throws
when you're paralyzed.

03:18:54.701 --> 03:18:57.672
TALIESIN: You can't dex out of something if you
can't move.

03:18:57.672 --> 03:19:03.717
TRAVIS: If I throw you over to her, can you
Revivify?

03:19:03.717 --> 03:19:06.927
SAM: I'm too far to do anything, right?

03:19:06.927 --> 03:19:09.688
MATT: At the moment?

03:19:09.688 --> 03:19:13.536
SAM: It has to be within 60 feet.

03:19:13.536 --> 03:19:19.377
MATT: From Delilah? She's within 40 feet of you.

03:19:19.377 --> 03:19:23.474
SAM: Can I retroactively Counterspell? (laughs)

03:19:23.474 --> 03:19:31.482
MATT: Yeah. I'll let you do it. You have your
ability back, so I'll let you try for it.

03:19:31.482 --> 03:19:35.496
MARISHA: Wait, with the Disintegrate? Go, Scanlan,
go!

03:19:35.496 --> 03:19:39.199
TRAVIS: Do you have to roll for this?

03:19:39.199 --> 03:19:41.146
SAM: I think I have to roll for this.

03:19:41.146 --> 03:19:43.804
MATT: You roll and add your charisma modifier.

03:19:43.804 --> 03:19:57.395
SAM: No. Charisma modifier? It's just an 11.

03:19:57.395 --> 03:20:00.937
MATT: Plus two, because you get plus two bonus, so
13.

03:20:00.937 --> 03:20:04.230
SAM: I can't add anything else.

03:20:04.230 --> 03:20:06.466
LAURA, TALIESIN, and MARISHA: Can you inspire
yourself?

03:20:06.466 --> 03:20:09.337
SAM: Not on a reaction, I don't think.

03:20:09.337 --> 03:20:11.558
MARISHA: But you're a war bard, right?

03:20:11.558 --> 03:20:13.447
MATT: He's not a war bard. He's a lore bard.

03:20:13.447 --> 03:20:16.014
MARISHA: War caster.

03:20:16.014 --> 03:20:21.203
TALIESIN: Oh man, this does not feel good.

03:20:21.203 --> 03:20:23.418
SAM: Doesn't feel good.

03:20:23.418 --> 03:20:25.239
TALIESIN: It does not feel good.

03:20:25.239 --> 03:20:33.134
MATT: Peerless skill. When you make an ability
check. It's an ability check, technically.

03:20:33.134 --> 03:20:34.375
SAM: What's that mean?

03:20:34.375 --> 03:20:39.928
MATT: That means you can spend another bardic
inspiration to it because you're at a 13.

03:20:39.928 --> 03:20:49.457
SAM: (nervous laughter) It's cocked. It would have
been 11. Four.

03:20:49.457 --> 03:20:54.983
MATT: It's a 17? The spell is a 6th-level spell.
The DC is 16.

03:20:54.983 --> 03:20:56.537
TALIESIN: Oh god!

03:20:56.537 --> 03:20:58.179
LAURA: You're not disintegrated?

03:20:58.179 --> 03:21:00.041
TRAVIS: Are you serious?

03:21:00.041 --> 03:21:01.743
SAM: Matt is a gentle god.

03:21:01.743 --> 03:21:12.662
MATT: In this flash of vision, Keyleth, you see
this happen, and then the bit of inspiration from

03:21:12.662 --> 03:21:18.557
the Raven Queen that's been trying to push through
whatever is keeping her vision at bay here. Your

03:21:18.557 --> 03:21:23.279
vision flashes back, and then you see Vax on the
ground, the extended finger of Delilah as the

03:21:23.279 --> 03:21:27.238
green energy begins to spiral up from her finger,
and Scanlan in the back just says?

03:21:27.238 --> 03:21:38.080
SAM: Oh. Hey, you know what the problem is with
your face? I can see it!

03:21:38.080 --> 03:21:41.119
(laughter)

03:21:41.119 --> 03:21:47.646
MATT: Delilah goes, "What?" and the spell
(fluttering noise) dissipates. (sighs)

03:21:47.646 --> 03:21:52.197
MARISHA: That was a 6th-level spell?

03:21:52.197 --> 03:21:53.619
MATT: Yeah.

03:21:53.619 --> 03:21:55.120
MARISHA: Does she have any more of those?

03:21:55.120 --> 03:21:56.573
LAURA: We don't know.

03:21:56.573 --> 03:21:58.764
MARISHA: Because I only have two.

03:21:58.764 --> 03:22:12.889
MATT: That being the case, Delilah is going to go
ahead and go. You do get an attack of opportunity

03:22:12.889 --> 03:22:14.496
on her, Keyleth.

03:22:14.496 --> 03:22:16.108
MARISHA: Just straight melee?

03:22:16.108 --> 03:22:17.107
MATT: Straight melee.

03:22:17.107 --> 03:22:18.812
TALIESIN: Hit her with a stick.

03:22:18.812 --> 03:22:24.727
MARISHA: My dice suck.

03:22:24.727 --> 03:22:27.999
LAURA: You've rolled shit on that dice every
time tonight.

03:22:27.999 --> 03:22:35.316
MARISHA: It's not good. 13.

03:22:35.316 --> 03:22:38.837
MATT: 13? No, that misses, unfortunately.

03:22:38.837 --> 03:22:41.366
MARISHA: Fuck it.

03:22:41.366 --> 03:22:45.479
MATT: Okay. Grog, it's your turn now.

03:22:45.479 --> 03:22:53.504
TRAVIS: Sure. Can I use my-- are we doing this?

03:22:53.504 --> 03:22:54.765
ASHLEY: Yeah.

03:22:54.765 --> 03:23:01.195
TRAVIS: Can I use my action to pick up my buddy
Pike, and I'm going to try and throw her as far as

03:23:01.195 --> 03:23:04.833
I can towards where Vex's body is laying.

03:23:04.833 --> 03:23:07.128
MATT: Okay, so you're going to pick her up and
move?

03:23:07.128 --> 03:23:10.479
TRAVIS: There's no difference, right?

03:23:10.479 --> 03:23:13.548
MATT: You can pick her up and move and then throw
her to give her the most distance, but you can

03:23:13.548 --> 03:23:18.444
only move half your speed as you're carrying her.
It's essentially an agreed-upon grapple. You'd be

03:23:18.444 --> 03:23:20.292
able to move 25 feet with her.

03:23:20.292 --> 03:23:23.995
TRAVIS: Versus picking her up and throwing her for
an athletics check, or something?

03:23:23.995 --> 03:23:27.777
MATT: You can, but I don't know how far you'll
throw her that way. It's up to you. You can stay

03:23:27.777 --> 03:23:29.659
where you are, if you'd like to.

03:23:29.659 --> 03:23:32.841
ASHLEY: I'll make it.

03:23:32.841 --> 03:23:34.617
TRAVIS: You think so?

03:23:34.617 --> 03:23:38.191
ASHLEY: Yeah. I can make it to her.

03:23:38.191 --> 03:23:40.643
LIAM: The initiative is Grog, Pike, Vax right
now.

03:23:40.643 --> 03:23:43.320
TRAVIS: I should just go unload?

03:23:43.320 --> 03:23:45.140
ASHLEY: Yeah, do your thing.

03:23:45.140 --> 03:23:48.829
TRAVIS: I would like to rage.

03:23:48.829 --> 03:23:51.861
MATT: You are raging.

03:23:51.861 --> 03:23:55.919
TRAVIS: Can I use my full speed to head towards
Delilah?

03:23:55.919 --> 03:24:07.704
MATT: (counting) That's as far as you can get
right there.

03:24:07.704 --> 03:24:13.745
TRAVIS: With my bonus action, can I use my Boots
of Feral Leaping to leap horizontally 20 feet? I

03:24:13.745 --> 03:24:15.243
want to get within melee.

03:24:15.243 --> 03:24:18.098
MATT: Okay, make an athletics check.

03:24:18.098 --> 03:24:22.284
TRAVIS: That's a million. 25.

03:24:22.284 --> 03:24:26.675
MATT: (impact) You land right in front of her. She
watches you as you (footsteps) run around the

03:24:26.675 --> 03:24:30.915
side, leap, (impact) right in front of her, this
giant, hulking form of muscle.

03:24:30.915 --> 03:24:34.945
TRAVIS: Yeah. Reckless, great weapon master.

03:24:34.945 --> 03:24:38.275
TALIESIN: Turn her to fucking paste.

03:24:38.275 --> 03:24:39.583
MATT: You have two attacks.

03:24:39.583 --> 03:24:41.675
TRAVIS: Yeah, two attacks.

03:24:41.675 --> 03:24:44.572
MARISHA: Why am I light-headed?

03:24:44.572 --> 03:24:47.216
TRAVIS: Everything's going wrong.

03:24:47.216 --> 03:24:50.633
TALIESIN: Well, that, and those drinks were really
inappropriate.

03:24:50.633 --> 03:24:54.600
TRAVIS: 28?

03:24:54.600 --> 03:24:57.246
MATT: 28? Yeah, that hits.

03:24:57.246 --> 03:25:20.500
TRAVIS: 19. 29. 35, and four because I'm enlarged.
35, total on the first one. And the second one,

03:25:20.500 --> 03:25:30.649
19. Should have taken that other thing. That would
have been a crit. Minus five. 27?

03:25:30.649 --> 03:25:33.277
MATT: 27 does hit, yes.

03:25:33.277 --> 03:25:49.366
TRAVIS: Boy, she's got a high AC, doesn't she? 10,
24, 34, three points of necrotic for 37. That's a

03:25:49.366 --> 03:25:54.328
d8. That's the wrong one. 36 points of damage.

03:25:54.328 --> 03:26:00.596
MATT: As you rush forward and cleave into her with
hit after hit on the axe, you watch as her

03:26:00.596 --> 03:26:06.469
imposing form is battered around and slashed
apart, and as you finish and withdraw the axe from

03:26:06.469 --> 03:26:10.389
the two strikes, you see her already clutching her
stomach. (panting)

03:26:10.389 --> 03:26:15.309
TRAVIS: An action surge is a bonus action, right?

03:26:15.309 --> 03:26:16.846
MATT: No. Just an action surge.

03:26:16.846 --> 03:26:18.416
TALIESIN: You can just do it.

03:26:18.416 --> 03:26:20.113
TRAVIS: Should we empty the tank?

03:26:20.113 --> 03:26:21.046
LAURA: Yeah.

03:26:21.046 --> 03:26:22.518
TRAVIS: I'll use the action surge.

03:26:22.518 --> 03:26:24.093
MATT: Okay. Go for it.

03:26:24.093 --> 03:26:25.569
TALIESIN: Is that three more attacks?

03:26:25.569 --> 03:26:26.813
MATT: Two more.

03:26:26.813 --> 03:26:32.317
TRAVIS: Reckless, great weapon, all the shit.
Goddamn, that was two 19s in a row. If I'd picked

03:26:32.317 --> 03:26:36.234
that other thing, they would have been criticals.
28.

03:26:36.234 --> 03:26:38.167
MATT: 28 hits, definitely.

03:26:38.167 --> 03:26:53.708
TRAVIS: 17, 27, 29. That's a fucking d8 again.
31.

03:26:53.708 --> 03:26:55.629
MATT: 31?

03:26:55.629 --> 03:26:57.250
TRAVIS: 31 points of damage.

03:26:57.250 --> 03:27:00.511
MATT: All righty. Second attack?

03:27:00.511 --> 03:27:09.390
TRAVIS: 27.

03:27:09.390 --> 03:27:11.632
MATT: Jesus. Yes, that hits.

03:27:11.632 --> 03:27:26.661
TRAVIS: I'm a monstrous thing. That's a 12, 26,
36, 38, 40,

03:27:26.661 --> 03:27:29.303
including the enlarged and the necrotic.

03:27:29.303 --> 03:27:34.502
MATT: You slam her with the two extra attacks,
knocking her back. As the two additional axe blows

03:27:34.502 --> 03:27:38.237
slice across the front of her chest, one gets her
on the side of her chin. You can see, you've

03:27:38.237 --> 03:27:43.707
carved the cheek open and broken teeth, and now
when she looks back to you, you can see all of her

03:27:43.707 --> 03:27:48.786
back molars and teeth now, this horrible Joker
grin on one side of her face as the blood leaks

03:27:48.786 --> 03:27:57.516
out. You can see the one gleaming greenish-yellow
glowing eye flares open at you. She (spits).

03:27:57.516 --> 03:28:00.345
TRAVIS: Don't stop smiling on my account.

03:28:00.345 --> 03:28:17.212
MATT: That ends your turn, Grog... All right, so
ghostly claws begin to spring up from the ground

03:28:17.212 --> 03:28:18.690
in a 20-foot radius.

03:28:18.690 --> 03:28:21.767
TRAVIS: Did you say claws?

03:28:21.767 --> 03:28:22.912
MATT: Claws, yes.

03:28:22.912 --> 03:28:24.576
SAM: Ghostly claws.

03:28:24.576 --> 03:28:36.419
MATT: Right there. I need-- Vax fails. I need
Keyleth and Grog and Trinket to all make dexterity

03:28:36.419 --> 03:28:38.614
saving throws. Sorry, strength saving throws.

03:28:38.614 --> 03:28:41.363
LAURA: He can't do anything.

03:28:41.363 --> 03:28:43.010
MARISHA: Don't fuck me, Gil!

03:28:43.010 --> 03:28:44.381
TALIESIN: Trinket can.

03:28:44.381 --> 03:28:47.739
LAURA: Trinket can't still attack if I'm not
alive.

03:28:47.739 --> 03:28:52.566
MATT: I'll let you. I'll let you, in the purposes
of you being dead, Trinket is going to act on his

03:28:52.566 --> 03:28:54.950
own to defend you.

03:28:54.950 --> 03:28:56.856
LAURA: He rolled a seven.

03:28:56.856 --> 03:29:03.913
TALIESIN: He's about to be in a pocket dimension
really quick.

03:29:03.913 --> 03:29:06.753
LAURA: Yeah, he might go into the pocket
dimension.

03:29:06.753 --> 03:29:07.558
MATT: Grog?

03:29:07.558 --> 03:29:08.626
TRAVIS: 22.

03:29:08.626 --> 03:29:14.689
MATT: 22. You take five points of necrotic damage,
and are not grappled. You take ten points of

03:29:14.689 --> 03:29:20.888
necrotic damage, reduced to half, five, because of your
armor, and you are

03:29:20.888 --> 03:29:24.791
grappled and paralyzed. Keyleth?

03:29:24.791 --> 03:29:25.873
MARISHA: 22.

03:29:25.873 --> 03:29:27.907
MATT: 22. You take five points of necrotic
damage.

03:29:27.907 --> 03:29:32.086
LAURA: And Trinket takes how much necrotic
damage?

03:29:32.086 --> 03:29:46.822
MATT: Ten, and is grappled. Trinket's speed is
zero. All right. Welcome to the God Wars, guys.

03:29:46.822 --> 03:29:50.541
TALIESIN: Not cool.

03:29:50.541 --> 03:29:54.634
MARISHA: Why didn't we Heroes' Feast?

03:29:54.634 --> 03:29:56.577
LAURA: It wouldn't have mattered.

03:29:56.577 --> 03:30:01.392
LIAM: Let's get a god in here. Light or dark meat.
I don't care. One or the other. Get one of those

03:30:01.392 --> 03:30:02.979
ladies in here!

03:30:02.979 --> 03:30:13.338
MATT: (heavy footfalls) With these heavy, armored
footfalls as it walks, with its fingers forward,

03:30:13.338 --> 03:30:20.473
it begins carving this sigil in the air. Grabs it
and turns it, and as it turns, you watch the same

03:30:20.473 --> 03:30:25.590
sigil runes appear around Grog and begin to spiral
around you. Make a charisma saving throw, please.

03:30:25.590 --> 03:30:32.386
TRAVIS: Fuck, balls. Hey, y'all, plus one. Don't
worry. Four.

03:30:32.386 --> 03:30:36.713
MATT: Grog, you vanish.

03:30:36.713 --> 03:30:39.759
(groaning)

03:30:39.759 --> 03:30:42.564
MATT: Banished from this realm of existence.

03:30:42.564 --> 03:30:44.684
TRAVIS: No!

03:30:44.684 --> 03:30:53.616
MATT: You appear on the ground in the Shadowfell,
in the gaping crater where Thar Amphala once

03:30:53.616 --> 03:31:03.568
stood. You look around, up to the familiar cloudy,
dark sky, and are alone.

03:31:03.568 --> 03:31:06.221
TRAVIS: Wait. Y'all aren't in the Shadowfell
anymore?

03:31:06.221 --> 03:31:07.257
TALIESIN: No.

03:31:07.257 --> 03:31:08.743
TRAVIS: Oh, right. Snow's falling.

03:31:08.743 --> 03:31:11.767
LAURA: Wildemount, or some shit.

03:31:11.767 --> 03:31:14.938
TRAVIS: Without a perception check, is anybody
around, or is it just me?

03:31:14.938 --> 03:31:18.537
MATT: Nobody's around you, although you do look up
and see maybe a dozen or so of the gloom stalkers,

03:31:18.537 --> 03:31:21.522
swirling up ahead. They haven't noticed you yet.

03:31:21.522 --> 03:31:23.732
TALIESIN: God fucking damn it.

03:31:23.732 --> 03:31:27.488
SAM: You've been banished to another dimension.
You can punch your way out of it.

03:31:27.488 --> 03:31:30.483
TRAVIS: You know what? I only have one thought.

03:31:30.483 --> 03:31:35.938
MARISHA: Oh no. He's going to turn to the cards,
y'all. He's going to turn to those cards.

03:31:35.938 --> 03:31:37.651
TRAVIS: We've got this.

03:31:37.651 --> 03:31:39.735
MATT: Keyleth, perception check.

03:31:39.735 --> 03:31:40.783
MARISHA: What?

03:31:40.783 --> 03:31:42.074
MATT: Perception check.

03:31:42.074 --> 03:31:49.475
MARISHA: Ugh! Okay. That's good. 14 plus 13, so
27.

03:31:49.475 --> 03:31:54.582
MATT: You do notice, the armored death knight
still has a hand out after Grog's banishing.

03:31:54.582 --> 03:31:58.105
LAURA: Okay.

03:31:58.105 --> 03:32:00.023
TALIESIN: Okay, that's good!

03:32:00.023 --> 03:32:03.308
MATT: This doesn't appear to be Plane Shift.

03:32:03.308 --> 03:32:11.832
MARISHA: So if I kill him, he'll come back? Or if
I kill him, Grog won't ever come back?

03:32:11.832 --> 03:32:13.302
What does that mean?!

03:32:13.302 --> 03:32:18.865
TALIESIN: We'll find out. We'll just lay waste to
shit until it stops happening. We're going to keep

03:32:18.865 --> 03:32:22.999
doing terrible shit until terrible shit stops
happening.

03:32:22.999 --> 03:32:26.065
LIAM: Pickle time.

03:32:26.065 --> 03:32:32.512
TRAVIS: This is the worst grin you've ever given
us. It's so great.

03:32:32.512 --> 03:32:37.248
MATT: We are at the end of the death knight's
turn. Vecna's going to use two legendary actions

03:32:37.248 --> 03:32:39.430
to cast another spell.

03:32:39.430 --> 03:32:46.553
ASHLEY: This feels like when we played in Liam's
one-shot when we got on the beach.

03:32:46.553 --> 03:32:49.583
LIAM: I was just about to say, this is revenge for
Demogorgon!

03:32:49.583 --> 03:32:51.505
TALIESIN: This is very much the beach, isn't it?

03:32:51.505 --> 03:33:01.154
MATT: Vecna's going to shift further back on the
field to there.

03:33:01.154 --> 03:33:03.957
MARISHA: Is he always going to fucking fly?

03:33:03.957 --> 03:33:06.608
MATT: Why wouldn't he?

03:33:06.608 --> 03:33:09.096
TALIESIN: Feet are passe.

03:33:09.096 --> 03:33:15.496
MATT: As he glides over, he looks down and sees
the mess that Delilah's currently in. Looks around

03:33:15.496 --> 03:33:20.714
and sees the options and says, "Well, I hate to
see work unfinished."

03:33:20.714 --> 03:33:24.028
SAM: Again?

03:33:24.028 --> 03:33:25.596
LIAM: Disintegrate?

03:33:25.596 --> 03:33:26.793
MATT: Disintegrate again.

03:33:26.793 --> 03:33:28.406
SAM: This is the same round, right?

03:33:28.406 --> 03:33:30.401
MATT: This is the next round.

03:33:30.401 --> 03:33:31.648
SAM: Can I try--

03:33:31.648 --> 03:33:34.874
MATT: He moved out of your range.

03:33:34.874 --> 03:33:36.193
SAM: Great.

03:33:36.193 --> 03:33:41.243
MARISHA: No!

03:33:41.243 --> 03:33:49.602
MATT: Now you see as a green ray fires down from
the Whispered One above, and within an instant--

03:33:49.602 --> 03:33:53.476
MARISHA: Wait, can I bonus action him? Can I use
my bonus action?

03:33:53.476 --> 03:33:55.879
MATT: Not on your turn.

03:33:55.879 --> 03:33:57.585
TALIESIN: I've got nothing.

03:33:57.585 --> 03:34:04.496
MATT: You turn to dust within the armor. Where
once Vax stood, the vision you saw flash you

03:34:04.496 --> 03:34:10.810
thought might have been a warning, instead it was
an omen. You look down and see the raven wings

03:34:10.810 --> 03:34:16.112
turn to ash, and now there is the empty armor of
the Raven Queen,

03:34:16.112 --> 03:34:18.493
the daggers clattering to the stone.

03:34:18.493 --> 03:34:23.477
TRAVIS: Oh man. What the fuck?

03:34:23.477 --> 03:34:25.280
MATT: Pike, it's your turn.

03:34:25.280 --> 03:34:30.045
ASHLEY: I can't do what I was going to do. Fuck.

03:34:30.045 --> 03:34:31.967
SAM: Laura.

03:34:31.967 --> 03:34:37.138
ASHLEY: Okay. Sorry. Hold on.

03:34:37.138 --> 03:34:38.951
SAM: She can't reach you?

03:34:38.951 --> 03:34:40.366
ASHLEY: Nope.

03:34:40.366 --> 03:34:42.500
SAM: I can bring you to her.

03:34:42.500 --> 03:34:45.355
MATT: You could hold your action and he could bamf
you over.

03:34:45.355 --> 03:34:51.193
ASHLEY: When are you up?

03:34:51.193 --> 03:34:53.024
SAM: I don't know.

03:34:53.024 --> 03:34:56.375
LAURA: Do whatever you want.

03:34:56.375 --> 03:35:00.379
SAM: You have to touch her?

03:35:00.379 --> 03:35:01.597
ASHLEY: Yeah.

03:35:01.597 --> 03:35:06.215
MATT: If you wanted to do something like that,
you'd have to begin casting it and hold your

03:35:06.215 --> 03:35:08.895
action for him to take his turn, and then you
could take her there.

03:35:08.895 --> 03:35:10.394
ASHLEY: Wait, who's up?

03:35:10.394 --> 03:35:15.039
MATT: It's you, Percy, then Scanlan.

03:35:15.039 --> 03:35:18.542
ASHLEY: Okay, so Percy's next, and then it's
Scanlan.

03:35:18.542 --> 03:35:22.262
SAM: If we don't die in those two turns, yes.

03:35:22.262 --> 03:35:29.541
ASHLEY: Okay. Oh my god, I'm shaking so bad. I
will start casting Revivify, and I will hold my

03:35:29.541 --> 03:35:33.295
turn until Scanlan bamfs us.

03:35:33.295 --> 03:35:37.947
SAM: I'm going to be a total dick and not do
that.

03:35:37.947 --> 03:35:39.950
ASHLEY: There's no one in between us?

03:35:39.950 --> 03:35:41.501
SAM: No, we're next to each other.

03:35:41.501 --> 03:35:43.611
ASHELY: I mean, no one in between us, like the bad
guys.

03:35:43.611 --> 03:35:45.296
SAM: Well, they can go whenever they want.

03:35:45.296 --> 03:35:51.250
MATT: Delilah already took her turn. Scanlan?

03:35:51.250 --> 03:35:52.911
SAM: Oh, it's my turn. Where's Percy?

03:35:52.911 --> 03:35:54.441
MATT: Sorry. Percy, you're up next.

03:35:54.441 --> 03:35:59.110
TALIESIN: I'm going to unload a few rounds of
Animus into Delilah, since she's still standing.

03:35:59.110 --> 03:36:00.792
She's still standing?

03:36:00.792 --> 03:36:02.001
MATT: She's still standing.

03:36:02.001 --> 03:36:09.031
TALIESIN: All right. Let's drop a point of grit,
and let's get some advantage on this for Animus

03:36:09.031 --> 03:36:20.596
shot number one. Come on, crit. Not a crit, but
still pretty decent. That's a 28 to hit?

03:36:20.596 --> 03:36:22.397
MATT: 28 to hit? That will hit.

03:36:22.397 --> 03:36:36.906
TALIESIN: That's not the full damage. Let's do
this, plus let's do that. That's 12 points of

03:36:36.906 --> 03:36:41.408
piercing damage, five points of psychic damage,
and four points of necrotic damage.

03:36:41.408 --> 03:36:47.009
MATT: Okay. Necrotic damage doesn't do anything,
unfortunately.

03:36:47.009 --> 03:36:50.518
TALIESIN: I know. I'll keep that off, then, for
now.

03:36:50.518 --> 03:36:53.618
MATT: Okay. She's looking really hurt.

03:36:53.618 --> 03:37:02.655
TALIESIN: All right, let's take another shot. Same
thing, burning a grit because fuck it. And let's

03:37:02.655 --> 03:37:06.929
make this one-- these are not the right dice to
roll. I'm really nervous. Let's make this one a

03:37:06.929 --> 03:37:13.494
sharpshooter to see if we can pour a little more
pain. Natural 20. That's a crit.

03:37:13.494 --> 03:37:15.666
Let's get that grit back.

03:37:15.666 --> 03:37:16.937
MARISHA: Kill her!

03:37:16.937 --> 03:37:28.069
TALIESIN: I've got to use my pen! Don't shake me!
I shake so much on my own! That's 2d10 plus 2d6

03:37:28.069 --> 03:37:36.527
psychic, so that's four points of psychic damage.
That was a terrible roll.

03:37:36.527 --> 03:37:43.060
And 24 points of damage.

03:37:43.060 --> 03:37:44.819
MARISHA: Is that doubled?

03:37:44.819 --> 03:37:47.663
TALIESIN: Yeah, that's doubled. It was terrible.

03:37:47.663 --> 03:37:50.356
MATT: How do you want to do this on Delilah?

03:37:50.356 --> 03:38:02.221
TALIESIN: (sighs) I take my second shot. I call,
Delilah? Even if we die, it's fucking worth it.

03:38:02.221 --> 03:38:07.713
And I take it right in her good eye. I want me to
be the last thing she sees.

03:38:07.713 --> 03:38:18.947
MATT: As she turns around, you watch that side of
her face explode, and she falls back, the force of

03:38:18.947 --> 03:38:27.652
it knocking her off her feet. She (impact noise)
scatters across the stonework. You glance over,

03:38:27.652 --> 03:38:30.103
and you can see her looking face-up, and the
little green eye in the

03:38:30.103 --> 03:38:32.435
socket turns and looks towards you.

03:38:32.435 --> 03:38:35.218
SAM: Wait, it's still working?

03:38:35.218 --> 03:38:38.796
MATT: The eye turned and looked at you from within
the socket.

03:38:38.796 --> 03:38:40.186
TALIESIN: But it's down.

03:38:40.186 --> 03:38:42.574
SAM: There's a creature inside of her.

03:38:42.574 --> 03:38:53.526
TALIESIN: Off. (sighs) For my third shot, Mr.
Armor. And I get another grit back because she's

03:38:53.526 --> 03:38:58.638
dead. Armor. I'm taking-- what's he holding?

03:38:58.638 --> 03:39:02.877
MATT: He currently has a longsword in one hand.
That's all he's currently holding.

03:39:02.877 --> 03:39:06.981
TALIESIN: He's holding a longsword? Let's get rid
of that longsword. I'm going to hit him and make

03:39:06.981 --> 03:39:08.584
him drop that longsword.

03:39:08.584 --> 03:39:09.809
MATT: Okay.

03:39:09.809 --> 03:39:17.390
TALIESIN: I'm burning a grit to make him drop it.
I know, this is a lot. I'm taking my third shot

03:39:17.390 --> 03:39:27.245
with Animus, and this is going to be a
sharpshooter shot, and that's not a crit, but

03:39:27.245 --> 03:39:30.896
that's pretty good. That's 29 to hit?

03:39:30.896 --> 03:39:32.139
MATT: That hits.

03:39:32.139 --> 03:39:46.466
TALIESIN: All right, so this is 1d10 plus 1d6.
That's terrible. That's 20 points of damage, two

03:39:46.466 --> 03:39:52.481
points of psychic damage, and he has to make a
strength saving throw

03:39:52.481 --> 03:39:58.125
or he drops his sword. DC 20.

03:39:58.125 --> 03:40:04.248
MATT: He gets a 20 exactly. 15 plus five. But he
did take the damage, so he has to make a

03:40:04.248 --> 03:40:08.834
concentration, which he makes. DC 11, because it's
half the damage.

03:40:08.834 --> 03:40:13.555
TALIESIN: Concentration? Oh, for that. That's
fine. Just because we're at that point where I'm

03:40:13.555 --> 03:40:18.599
panicking, let's burn an action surge. Boom. Three
more shots on the asshole.

03:40:18.599 --> 03:40:22.926
MARISHA: Are you shooting at Vecna?

03:40:22.926 --> 03:40:24.868
TALIESIN: No, Vecna I'm not shooting because he's
laughing off my bullets.

03:40:24.868 --> 03:40:26.732
MATT: Most of the impact deflects off the plate.

03:40:26.732 --> 03:40:28.222
MARISHA: You're shooting at the death knight?

03:40:28.222 --> 03:40:32.048
TALIESiN: I'm shooting at the death knight, so now
I'm going to do a grit shot. I'm going to burn for

03:40:32.048 --> 03:40:40.555
dead-eye sharpshooter. That's 27?

03:40:40.555 --> 03:40:44.593
MATT: 27? Okay, that hits.

03:40:44.593 --> 03:40:52.056
TALIESIN: And that's-- oh my fucking god! 20
points of damage,

03:40:52.056 --> 03:40:53.774
plus one point of psychic damage.

03:40:53.774 --> 03:40:57.354
SAM: You're fine. You're good.

03:40:57.354 --> 03:40:58.769
TALIESIN: Burning another--

03:40:58.769 --> 03:41:02.337
SAM: It's the last thing.

03:41:02.337 --> 03:41:11.805
TALIESIN: I've got more. I've got three more. I
keep killing things. That's 17 to hit?

03:41:11.805 --> 03:41:18.050
MATT: 17. You watch as he's concentrating on that
one spell, and as the one shot hits him, the

03:41:18.050 --> 03:41:21.299
second one, he puts his arm up and seems to
deflect it with his hand.

03:41:21.299 --> 03:41:25.349
TALIESIN: Did he make a constitution save against
the last one?

03:41:25.349 --> 03:41:26.966
MATT: Yes, he did.

03:41:26.966 --> 03:41:40.834
TALIESIN: Okay. This is my last shot. I'm burning
another grit, and natural 20. Okay, so that's

03:41:40.834 --> 03:41:45.913
going to be-- come on. That's better!

03:41:45.913 --> 03:41:50.170
MATT: I forgot to mention. Vecna took extra damage
from your crit earlier.

03:41:50.170 --> 03:42:04.871
TALIESIN: Yes, he did. He took 15 points of extra
damage, halved. 18, 21, 22, 23, 30 points of

03:42:04.871 --> 03:42:13.198
damage, plus five psychic damage, and he's going
to take 15 points of damage, plus three psychic

03:42:13.198 --> 03:42:14.433
damage next round.

03:42:14.433 --> 03:42:21.790
MATT: That was a 16 and a one, so with his
constitution bonus, he saves.

03:42:21.790 --> 03:42:23.468
He maintains concentration.

03:42:23.468 --> 03:42:24.930
TALIESIN: Oh my fucking god!

03:42:24.930 --> 03:42:28.092
MATT: It's hard to break. He was designed for
that.

03:42:28.092 --> 03:42:31.911
TALIESIN: I'm going to use my bonus action to
reload, and that's my fucking turn.

03:42:31.911 --> 03:42:33.342
MATT: Okay.

03:42:33.342 --> 03:42:35.359
SAM: That was a long turn.

03:42:35.359 --> 03:42:36.407
TALIESIN: I know.

03:42:36.407 --> 03:42:37.566
SAM: You did good.

03:42:37.566 --> 03:42:39.829
MATT: All right. End of Percy's turn. Scanlan.

03:42:39.829 --> 03:42:40.841
SAM: Okay.

03:42:40.841 --> 03:42:42.416
MATT: Percy, do you want to move on your turn?

03:42:42.416 --> 03:42:50.130
TALIESIN: No. There's nowhere. I'm as far away
from everybody as I can currently be.

03:42:50.130 --> 03:42:52.073
There's nowhere else.

03:42:52.073 --> 03:42:57.188
MATT: I'm letting you know, as it currently
stands. Delilah's down.

03:42:57.188 --> 03:42:58.616
TALIESIN: Delilah's down.

03:42:58.616 --> 03:43:04.926
MATT: And two figures that look pretty much
untouched. Scanlan?

03:43:04.926 --> 03:43:06.612
MARISHA: What are you trying to say?

03:43:06.612 --> 03:43:10.143
MATT: I'm saying, be mindful of your choices.

03:43:10.143 --> 03:43:15.867
TALIESIN: You know what? I'm going to start making
a beeline straight for Keyleth. Fuck it. I'm going

03:43:15.867 --> 03:43:20.346
to see if I can get some cover behind--

03:43:20.346 --> 03:43:23.339
MARISHA: Are we going to bail? What do we do?

03:43:23.339 --> 03:43:25.568
TALIESIN: I'm fucking bailing.

03:43:25.568 --> 03:43:29.961
MATT: That's up to you. You do have one of them
down, and you have two--

03:43:29.961 --> 03:43:34.577
TRAVIS: If you can bail--

03:43:34.577 --> 03:43:35.617
MARISHA: But Grog.

03:43:35.617 --> 03:43:38.148
TALIESIN: We can get Grog back. We've just got to
get everybody up.

03:43:38.148 --> 03:43:41.049
TRAVIS: You don't even know where I am.

03:43:41.049 --> 03:43:42.671
LIAM: You can find him.

03:43:42.671 --> 03:43:44.385
MARISHA: What about you?

03:43:44.385 --> 03:43:47.740
LIAM: I'm gone. There's no finding me. I'm gone.

03:43:47.740 --> 03:43:49.429
TALIESIN: We're picking up armor.

03:43:49.429 --> 03:43:50.484
MATT: Scanlan?

03:43:50.484 --> 03:43:56.945
SAM: I grab Pikey-poo and Dimension Door straight
to Vex's beautiful dead body.

03:43:56.945 --> 03:44:01.702
TRAVIS: Like a dead Juliet.

03:44:01.702 --> 03:44:07.584
SAM: I will inspire Pike. I don't know if that
helps whatever ritual

03:44:07.584 --> 03:44:09.502
you're about to do, but maybe.

03:44:09.502 --> 03:44:12.128
TRAVIS and TALIESIN: Revivify.

03:44:12.128 --> 03:44:13.738
ASHLEY: What do you get if you're inspired?

03:44:13.738 --> 03:44:17.391
MATT: You get a d12 that you can spend on
something. Which, as you release Revivify, you

03:44:17.391 --> 03:44:21.961
reach down and grab the cold, lifeless hand of
Vex. I need you to roll a wisdom check.

03:44:21.961 --> 03:44:24.409
SAM: With inspiration.

03:44:24.409 --> 03:44:25.817
MATT: Should she need it.

03:44:25.817 --> 03:44:30.387
ASHLEY: And don't I get gnome cunning, so I have
advantage on it?

03:44:30.387 --> 03:44:35.240
MATT: No. It's not a saving throw. It's just a
check. Roll a d20 and add your wisdom modifier.

03:44:35.390 --> 03:44:41.481
TALIESIN: We will grab everything we fucking can.

03:44:41.481 --> 03:44:42.983
ASHLEY: 18.

03:44:42.983 --> 03:44:46.670
MATT: 18? Yeah. Your breath comes in.

03:44:46.670 --> 03:44:49.765
ASHLEY: Hi.

03:44:49.765 --> 03:44:53.033
LAURA: Pike. Are they dead?

03:44:53.033 --> 03:44:54.741
ASHLEY: No.

03:44:54.741 --> 03:44:59.220
MATT: You look over to your side, and you see
Delilah on the ground, her head scattered and

03:44:59.220 --> 03:45:05.801
exploded on the ground, the one yellowish-green
eye still moving around and taking in the scenery.

03:45:05.801 --> 03:45:11.799
You glance up, and you see Vecna still lording
over, a big smile on his face. You see the other

03:45:11.799 --> 03:45:18.689
armored knight walking around, the plated black
helmet guarding any expression except for these

03:45:18.689 --> 03:45:22.298
glowing red dots, the eyes that peer through.

03:45:22.433 --> 03:45:28.420
SAM: I'm using any movement I have to pick up the
dust of my fallen friend, if there is any dust.

03:45:28.420 --> 03:45:31.798
MATT: There's the dust and his equipment. Those
are the two things that are left.

03:45:31.798 --> 03:45:33.636
SAM: Pick up whatever I can.

03:45:33.636 --> 03:45:37.174
MARISHA: Scoop him into a little vial.

03:45:37.174 --> 03:45:38.846
LIAM: (vacuuming noises)

03:45:38.846 --> 03:45:42.522
(laughter)

03:45:42.522 --> 03:45:47.333
SAM: (fake sneeze) Oh no!

03:45:47.333 --> 03:45:54.845
TALIESIN: This is no time for allergies. Fuck!

03:45:54.845 --> 03:46:01.064
MATT: All right, so you get your hands up in the
armor and some dust and you gather it in your

03:46:01.064 --> 03:46:07.735
hand. There's Scanlan. There's you. There's Vex,
Pike.

03:46:07.735 --> 03:46:10.055
MARISHA: So we're all together?

03:46:10.055 --> 03:46:12.801
MATT: Well, Percy's there and Grog is somewhere.

03:46:12.801 --> 03:46:14.003
MARISHA: Percy.

03:46:14.003 --> 03:46:15.490
TALIESIN: I got as far as I could.

03:46:15.490 --> 03:46:18.650
SAM: I'm done. That's all I can do.

03:46:18.650 --> 03:46:20.154
ASHLEY: So bonus action.

03:46:20.154 --> 03:46:23.431
SAM: I don't know if you can do a bonus action.

03:46:23.431 --> 03:46:24.784
ASHLEY: Can I do a bonus action?

03:46:24.784 --> 03:46:25.794
MATT: Yeah.

03:46:25.794 --> 03:46:27.024
ASHLEY: Okay.

03:46:27.024 --> 03:46:32.899
TALIESIN: You need healing like a mother. Don't
shrug at me.

03:46:32.899 --> 03:46:34.292
SAM: She's fine.

03:46:34.292 --> 03:46:39.171
ASHLEY: I'm going to cast Healing Word on Vex.

03:46:39.171 --> 03:46:40.350
MATT: Level two?

03:46:40.350 --> 03:46:46.432
ASHLEY: Level four.

03:46:46.432 --> 03:46:49.806
MATT: Because you've already cast Revivify.

03:46:49.806 --> 03:46:51.316
ASHLEY: Level two.

03:46:51.316 --> 03:46:53.671
MATT: So 2d4 plus your wisdom modifier, I think.

03:46:53.671 --> 03:46:57.525
SAM: I'm already rolling Vax.

03:46:57.525 --> 03:47:03.179
LAURA: You're mixing him with your suude?

03:47:03.179 --> 03:47:04.467
SAM: Yeah.

03:47:04.467 --> 03:47:06.503
ASHLEY: Ten hit points.

03:47:06.503 --> 03:47:10.137
SAM: Tuck it behind my ear for later.

03:47:10.137 --> 03:47:16.492
TALIESIN: It doesn't matter anymore.

03:47:16.492 --> 03:47:20.524
LAURA: I haven't seen Vax yet. I haven't seen what
happened.

03:47:20.524 --> 03:47:22.024
ASHLEY: Can I move?

03:47:22.024 --> 03:47:24.951
MATT: No, because you already took your turn.

03:47:24.951 --> 03:47:28.073
ASHLEY: Oh my god.

03:47:28.073 --> 03:47:32.493
MATT: So that ends your turn? Scanlan, you moved
up there and you grabbed the stuff. That's your

03:47:32.493 --> 03:47:34.184
turn. Keyleth?

03:47:34.184 --> 03:47:44.427
MARISHA: Oh god. Okay. Are we trying to get to me
so I can get us all out?

03:47:44.427 --> 03:47:46.817
SAM: Yeah, but it's going to take another turn.

03:47:46.817 --> 03:47:48.767
LAURA: For Percy to get there.

03:47:48.767 --> 03:47:53.954
MARISHA: But everyone's coming this way, right?
Everyone's coming this way? Then I'm going to--

03:47:53.954 --> 03:48:07.745
fucking hell. How does Fire Storm work? I know
it's ten ten-foot cubes. Does it have to be on the

03:48:07.745 --> 03:48:18.980
ground, or can I hit him up there? Can I rain--
"justice rains from above!" Can I do that?

03:48:18.980 --> 03:48:22.690
TALIESIN: I haven't touched that game in so long.

03:48:22.690 --> 03:48:30.086
MATT: You can arrange as you wish. Each cube must
have at least one face adjacent to the face of

03:48:30.086 --> 03:48:36.318
another cube. Yeah, you can. Choose a location you
see within range, so I don't see why you couldn't.

03:48:36.318 --> 03:48:39.262
You can create a lava fall, essentially.

03:48:39.262 --> 03:48:41.959
TALIESIN: You'd have to pick one of the two of them
to hit.

03:48:41.959 --> 03:48:44.933
MATT: You pick one, and then you create a bunch of
cubes that chain off it.

03:48:44.933 --> 03:48:46.670
TALIESIN: You can hit them both.

03:48:46.670 --> 03:48:49.008
MARISHA: But I'm not going to be able to hit the
death knight and Vecna?

03:48:49.008 --> 03:48:53.425
MATT: Probably not. Not without hitting Scanlan or
yourself in the process.

03:48:53.425 --> 03:48:56.579
MARISHA: What if I got out of the way. Could I?

03:48:56.579 --> 03:48:59.161
MATT: We can try it.

03:48:59.161 --> 03:49:08.130
MARISHA: I'm going to do a bonus action and I'm
going to go air elemental. Full-on, wrath of my

03:49:08.130 --> 03:49:15.827
people and my hometown, and I'm going to levitate
in a cool tornado-y thing.

03:49:15.827 --> 03:49:25.572
MATT: Are there any material components for Fire
Storm? No, there is not. You can cast that in your

03:49:25.572 --> 03:49:33.365
form. You levitate up. We'll say right there.

03:49:33.365 --> 03:49:37.283
TALIESIN: There's a lot of dead bodies on the
ground, man.

03:49:37.283 --> 03:49:46.378
MATT: I know. This is rough, man. We'll say
there.

03:49:46.378 --> 03:49:49.470
MARISHA: That's high, but that's okay.

03:49:49.470 --> 03:49:51.094
MATT: How high did you want it?

03:49:51.094 --> 03:49:58.997
MARISHA: In between, but don't worry about it. I'm
going to right onto Vecna and try and swarm it down

03:49:58.997 --> 03:50:01.370
towards the death knight.

03:50:01.370 --> 03:50:02.999
MATT: How many cubes is it?

03:50:02.999 --> 03:50:04.652
MARISHA: Ten ten-foot cubes.

03:50:04.652 --> 03:50:19.032
MATT: That's ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five,
four, three, two, one.

03:50:19.032 --> 03:50:21.645
Just barely get him. Just barely.

03:50:21.645 --> 03:50:29.013
TALIESIN: That will do.

03:50:29.013 --> 03:50:31.811
MATT: Hold on.

03:50:31.811 --> 03:50:33.504
MARISHA: What do you mean, hold on?

03:50:33.504 --> 03:50:37.296
TRAVIS: There are some legendary things that I
think might be happening.

03:50:37.296 --> 03:50:38.534
TALIESIN: I get that vibe.

03:50:38.534 --> 03:50:43.991
MATT: Not legendary. As you swarm up and begin to
formulate the spell, Vecna looks at at you, and

03:50:43.991 --> 03:50:49.579
you can see with the vacant space where the hand
is, there's almost an arcane flash of a hand that

03:50:49.579 --> 03:50:52.368
goes, (clicks tongue). He's going to attempt to
Counterspell you.

03:50:52.368 --> 03:50:55.110
TALIESIN: Roll a one!

03:50:55.110 --> 03:50:59.917
MARISHA: What does he have to roll? Under my DC?

03:50:59.917 --> 03:51:08.334
MATT: It has to beat your DC. No, sorry. The level
of the spell, which would be 17. Which succeeds.

03:51:08.334 --> 03:51:16.932
He rolled a 14 plus ten, so 24. As you formulate
the spell, you watch as the flames sputter out.

03:51:16.932 --> 03:51:18.896
LAURA: Can you come back down to the ground?

03:51:18.896 --> 03:51:20.857
MARISHA: Yeah, I'll try and levitate down a bit.

03:51:20.857 --> 03:51:24.395
MATT: You were about there, and with your flying
speed, you can land back down on the ground if you

03:51:24.395 --> 03:51:32.110
want. Sorry. Is that your turn, Keyleth?

03:51:32.110 --> 03:51:34.777
MARISHA: I guess so.

03:51:34.777 --> 03:51:36.556
MATT: Okay.

03:51:36.556 --> 03:51:43.726
LAURA: What does it look like when you're looking
out at all of us and we're so sad?

03:51:43.726 --> 03:51:45.114
MATT: It feels awful.

03:51:45.114 --> 03:51:46.849
TRAVIS: I love it!

03:51:46.849 --> 03:51:48.825
TALIESIN: You're a liar. You're a lying liar.

03:51:48.825 --> 03:51:53.495
MATT: It legitimately feels awful, but we were
building to this for a long time.

03:51:53.495 --> 03:51:54.948
I've got to play it.

03:51:54.948 --> 03:51:56.116
TRAVIS: There's a god floating in the air.

03:51:56.116 --> 03:51:57.093
MATT: Not a god yet.

03:51:57.093 --> 03:51:58.141
TRAVIS: Not a god yet.

03:51:58.141 --> 03:51:59.499
MATT: That you know of.

03:51:59.499 --> 03:52:04.110
LAURA: He'll be a god in our next damn campaign
when we're all dead.

03:52:04.110 --> 03:52:09.973
MATT: He's going to use his last legendary action
at the end of Keyleth's turn to cast a cantrip at

03:52:09.973 --> 03:52:15.471
you, Vex, as you just got back to consciousness.
He's going to reach out with a Flame Bolt.

03:52:15.471 --> 03:52:19.927
LAURA: It's because I called him a dipshit when he
was talking earlier.

03:52:19.927 --> 03:52:21.540
TRAVIS: You did blurt that out.

03:52:21.540 --> 03:52:23.328
MATT: You did. You did taunt him.

03:52:23.328 --> 03:52:29.401
LAURA: He is a dipshit. Before he does his
cantrip, I'm going to go, you can go ahead and

03:52:29.401 --> 03:52:33.270
live forever, but you'll still be fucking ugly the
whole damn time!

03:52:33.270 --> 03:52:36.439
(laughter)

03:52:36.439 --> 03:52:44.792
MATT: Disadvantage because you're prone on the
ground and it's a ranged attack. That is a two

03:52:44.792 --> 03:52:46.760
plus 16. That is an 18.

03:52:46.760 --> 03:52:48.631
LAURA: To my armor class? He doesn't hit.

03:52:48.631 --> 03:52:53.291
MATT: I rolled a natural 20 and a two, by the way,
so if you weren't prone?

03:52:53.291 --> 03:52:55.363
TALIESIN: He would have--

03:52:55.363 --> 03:52:56.848
LAURA: Destroyed me.

03:52:56.848 --> 03:52:59.221
TRAVIS: You would be dust.

03:52:59.221 --> 03:53:07.791
MATT: As he points down with his still-missing
hand, releases this bolt and you see this flare up

03:53:07.791 --> 03:53:12.095
in the air and rush towards you, and you roll out
of the way and it (impact noise) slams into the

03:53:12.095 --> 03:53:15.837
stone below you. You hear it crack and break the
area where your head once was.

03:53:15.837 --> 03:53:19.193
Now it's Vecna's turn.

03:53:19.193 --> 03:53:21.729
TRAVIS: Now. (laughs) Now?

03:53:21.729 --> 03:53:25.926
ASHLEY: That wasn't his turn?

03:53:25.926 --> 03:53:27.796
MATT: That was a legendary action.

03:53:27.796 --> 03:53:32.722
ASHLEY: That was a legendary action? That's right.
I don't want any of it!

03:53:32.722 --> 03:53:34.714
TALIESIN: None of us want this.

03:53:34.714 --> 03:53:36.426
TRAVIS: I don't want it! I don't like it!

03:53:36.426 --> 03:53:38.874
ASHLEY: I don't even want to play.

03:53:38.874 --> 03:53:46.723
TRAVIS: Taryon's back in Whitestone having a
fucking ball.

03:53:46.723 --> 03:53:48.572
TALIESIN: Taryon's sitting with a cup of tea.

03:53:48.572 --> 03:53:52.837
SAM: No, Taryon's on the floor, weeping, holding
his necklace.

03:53:52.837 --> 03:53:56.894
ALL: Oh!

03:53:56.894 --> 03:54:00.273
ASHLEY: He doesn't know who it is.

03:54:00.273 --> 03:54:03.649
TALIESIN: We've got one way down. We are all
having the thumpa-thumpa right now.

03:54:03.649 --> 03:54:06.256
LAURA: It's red. All flashing red.

03:54:06.256 --> 03:54:07.723
MATT: Okay.

03:54:07.723 --> 03:54:10.701
ASHLEY: Why did you say okay that way?

03:54:10.701 --> 03:54:14.366
SAM: Liam can be Taryon now! (laughs)

03:54:14.366 --> 03:54:17.714
TALIESIN: You're terrible.

03:54:17.714 --> 03:54:24.984
SAM: No! It's an established character we already
have artwork for. Why let it go to waste? He's

03:54:24.984 --> 03:54:27.495
done prissy boys before.

03:54:27.495 --> 03:54:29.463
TRAVIS: Look at Matt's face.

03:54:29.463 --> 03:54:36.194
MATT: Vecna's going to lean down, seeing that you
just brought life back to Vex--

03:54:36.194 --> 03:54:37.930
TRAVIS: Don't you do it!

03:54:37.930 --> 03:54:42.314
LAURA: Matthew, don't do it!

03:54:42.314 --> 03:54:44.141
MATT: "Join your friend."

03:54:44.141 --> 03:54:45.832
ALL: No!

03:54:45.832 --> 03:54:47.966
SAM: I will 6th-level Counterspell.

03:54:47.966 --> 03:54:51.012
(cheering)

03:54:51.012 --> 03:54:53.841
TRAVIS: We will not go quietly into the night!

03:54:53.841 --> 03:55:00.893
SAM: I will sing at him, (singing) Counterspell,
baby don't hurt me.

03:55:00.893 --> 03:55:05.844
Don't hurt me no more. Counterspell!

03:55:05.844 --> 03:55:07.977
MATT: Okay. Roll a d20.

03:55:07.977 --> 03:55:11.572
MATT: It's a 7th-level Finger of Death.

03:55:11.723 --> 03:55:13.383
LAURA: Is that a natural 20?

03:55:13.383 --> 03:55:14.667
TALIESIN: No.

03:55:14.667 --> 03:55:17.754
MARISHA: Scanlan! No!

03:55:17.754 --> 03:55:21.716
TRAVIS: What is this up and down cardiac arrrest
game?

03:55:21.716 --> 03:55:23.357
MATT: Natural one?

03:55:23.357 --> 03:55:24.971
TALIESIN: Stop rolling that die.

03:55:24.971 --> 03:55:27.158
LAURA: And you're below 100?

03:55:27.158 --> 03:55:28.697
TRAVIS: It really is a one?

03:55:28.697 --> 03:55:30.080
TALIESIN: It really was a one.

03:55:30.080 --> 03:55:33.089
SAM: I can add things to it, right?

03:55:33.089 --> 03:55:34.172
TALIESIN: No, you can't.

03:55:34.172 --> 03:55:38.125
MATT: 7d8. I need you to make a constitution
saving throw.

03:55:38.125 --> 03:55:40.595
ASHLEY: I make a constitution saving throw? Okay.

03:55:40.595 --> 03:55:41.673
SAM: You're still inspired.

03:55:41.673 --> 03:55:43.026
LAURA: You're inspired!

03:55:43.026 --> 03:55:45.077
ASHLEY: "You're spired!"

03:55:45.077 --> 03:55:47.040
LAURA: Inspired. Use it!

03:55:47.040 --> 03:55:48.543
ASHLEY: Okay.

03:55:48.543 --> 03:55:53.235
TRAVIS: It's a d10, right?

03:55:53.235 --> 03:55:54.894
SAM: d12 on top of that.

03:55:54.894 --> 03:55:56.427
MATT: What did you roll?

03:55:56.427 --> 03:55:57.729
ASHLEY: 13.

03:55:57.729 --> 03:56:00.647
LIAM: Plus the inspiration.

03:56:00.647 --> 03:56:06.520
ASHLEY: No, just the 13. Plus-- 19?

03:56:06.520 --> 03:56:10.695
MATT: No. You take 67 points of necrotic damage.

03:56:10.695 --> 03:56:13.706
LAURA: It wasn't Power Word Kill, it was Finger of
Death?

03:56:13.706 --> 03:56:18.372
MATT: No, he'd already used his Power Word Kill.
Remember, he's not a god yet.

03:56:18.372 --> 03:56:21.011
ASHLEY: Okay.

03:56:21.011 --> 03:56:22.872
LAURA: Just the one. Just the one Power Word
Kill.

03:56:22.872 --> 03:56:25.197
TRAVIS: The fact that he's not a god gives me
diarrhea feelings.

03:56:25.197 --> 03:56:28.256
ASHLEY: Okay.

03:56:28.256 --> 03:56:36.990
MATT: All right, and he's going to move back a
bit, frustrated at the--

03:56:36.990 --> 03:56:41.369
SAM: At everything.

03:56:41.369 --> 03:56:48.629
MATT: At your attempts to Counterspell. Actually,
no. He laughed at that. "Nice try."

03:56:48.629 --> 03:56:51.303
SAM: It wasn't my best performance.

03:56:51.303 --> 03:56:56.796
MATT: All right, that's going to end his turn.
Delilah's out. Grog.

03:56:56.796 --> 03:56:59.791
TRAVIS: (laughs)

03:56:59.791 --> 03:57:05.377
MATT: Make a stealth check.

03:57:05.377 --> 03:57:08.590
TRAVIS: Cool. Right. Pass Without a Trace is still
going, right?

03:57:08.590 --> 03:57:09.735
MATT: Nope.

03:57:09.735 --> 03:57:12.568
TRAVIS: That's a one.

03:57:12.568 --> 03:57:15.808
TALIESIN: Hello?

03:57:15.808 --> 03:57:29.393
MATT: As you're there, Grog, you hear
(screeching). A cloud of screeches, as about nine

03:57:29.393 --> 03:57:35.116
of these gloom stalkers all start (whoosh) going
into a dive towards you.

03:57:35.116 --> 03:57:37.486
SAM: Maybe one of them is our friend Mr.
Mistoffelees.

03:57:37.486 --> 03:57:39.777
MARISHA: Mr. Mistoffelees, come back!

03:57:39.777 --> 03:57:44.772
TRAVIS: Am I going to do anything? How far away is
the nearest structure?

03:57:44.772 --> 03:57:52.432
MATT: Nothing. It's a crater. You're where the
city used to be. You have at least a mile to each

03:57:52.432 --> 03:57:54.216
side of nothing but crater.

03:57:54.216 --> 03:57:55.600
TALIESIN: Fuck!

03:57:55.600 --> 03:57:59.119
ASHLEY: He's all by his lonesome!

03:57:59.119 --> 03:58:01.559
TALIESIN: One more round.

03:58:01.559 --> 03:58:05.948
SAM: He doesn't know.

03:58:05.948 --> 03:58:07.769
MARISHA: He could be stuck there forever!

03:58:07.769 --> 03:58:10.295
TALIESIN: There's nothing we can do right now.

03:58:10.295 --> 03:58:21.672
TRAVIS: I'm going to go into a frenzied rage, and
I'm going to use my second wind to heal 1d10 plus

03:58:21.672 --> 03:58:31.129
my fighter level. Three, six. Six points, yay.

03:58:31.129 --> 03:58:34.156
TALIESIN: How close to you do we have to be?

03:58:34.156 --> 03:58:35.801
MARISHA: We have to be touching.

03:58:35.801 --> 03:58:38.527
SAM: And you have to not be wind.

03:58:38.527 --> 03:58:40.877
MARISHA: I can be wind now.

03:58:40.877 --> 03:58:43.413
TRAVIS: I don't have any fighter things, so that's
my turn.

03:58:43.413 --> 03:58:59.777
MATT: That's your turn. Okay. Ending your turn.
Dark energy suffuses the landscape in the area.

03:58:59.777 --> 03:59:05.478
Actually, no. I'm not going to use that one
because nobody has necrotic resistance right now.

03:59:05.478 --> 03:59:10.021
More undead are going to pop up. Let's see how
many. That's actually a shitty roll.

03:59:10.021 --> 03:59:14.558
Four undead pop up.

03:59:14.558 --> 03:59:23.449
TALIESIN: They're bullshit. We don't care.

03:59:23.449 --> 03:59:33.856
MATT: All righty. That's going to be an attack on
you. It has advantage because you're prone and

03:59:33.856 --> 03:59:39.655
it's in melee. That's a 17. Still doesn't hit.
High armor. You're ducking out of the way. The

03:59:39.655 --> 03:59:46.842
skeleton is (tink) hitting the ground. It's also
attacking at you, Pike. That's cocked. Natural

03:59:46.842 --> 03:59:52.999
one. It goes to strike you, and it doesn't even
hit you. The holy symbol of Sarenrae flares, and

03:59:52.999 --> 03:59:59.486
it (raspy cry) pulls away from the blast of
vibrant, radiant energy. There's going to be one

03:59:59.486 --> 04:00:03.280
attacking you, Scanlan. That is a 20 to hit?

04:00:03.280 --> 04:00:04.452
SAM: Oh yeah.

04:00:04.452 --> 04:00:11.705
MATT: All right. You take eight points of slashing
damage. And attacking you,

04:00:11.705 --> 04:00:13.668
Percival, that's another 20.

04:00:13.668 --> 04:00:15.000
TALIESIN: That is my armor class.

04:00:15.000 --> 04:00:20.941
MATT: It hits you. You take 11 points of slashing
damage as it cuts through you.

04:00:20.941 --> 04:00:29.807
TALIESIN: I don't even acknowledge its existence.
I am definitely not amused.

04:00:29.807 --> 04:00:36.533
MARISHA: What was the name of that one city, you
guys?

04:00:36.533 --> 04:00:38.636
TALIESIN: Where is your dad from?

04:00:38.636 --> 04:00:41.402
MARISHA: Syngorn. Is Syngorn still in the
Feywild?

04:00:41.402 --> 04:00:42.771
LAURA: No.

04:00:42.771 --> 04:00:44.287
TALIESIN: Damn it.

04:00:44.287 --> 04:00:47.740
MARISHA: Where did we go? What city in the Feywild
did we go to?

04:00:47.740 --> 04:00:50.641
LAURA: We can go to the pond.

04:00:50.641 --> 04:00:52.283
TRAVIS: The death knight.

04:00:52.283 --> 04:00:59.096
MATT: Steps forward, seeing Scanlan attempt to
shrug off all these spells, comes rushing forward,

04:00:59.096 --> 04:01:06.703
and you watch as its blade begins to empower this
dark, black shadow, similar to the gloom stalkers

04:01:06.703 --> 04:01:11.929
you've seen before. As he brings the sword and
arcs it down with tremendous might, you hear the

04:01:11.929 --> 04:01:18.226
crack of thunder as this Staggering Smite slams
into you, or tries to, at least.

04:01:18.226 --> 04:01:19.862
SAM: That sounds bad.

04:01:19.862 --> 04:01:22.789
TALIESIN: That's bad. Do you have a reaction?

04:01:22.789 --> 04:01:24.478
SAM: I used it already.

04:01:24.478 --> 04:01:25.755
MATT: Shitty roll. 16 to hit?

04:01:25.755 --> 04:01:27.089
SAM: Oh yeah, that hits.

04:01:27.089 --> 04:01:28.147
MATT: Okay.

04:01:28.147 --> 04:01:31.864
SAM: I think I'm not attuned-- yeah.

04:01:31.864 --> 04:01:46.827
MATT: You take ten points of slashing damage, plus
17 points of necrotic damage.

04:01:46.827 --> 04:01:49.813
TALIESIN: 27.

04:01:49.813 --> 04:02:02.543
MATT: And as part of the Staggering Smite, you
also take 14 points of psychic damage, and make a

04:02:02.543 --> 04:02:04.084
wisdom saving throw.

04:02:04.084 --> 04:02:11.246
SAM: Against magic? That's better. 17.

04:02:11.246 --> 04:02:19.504
MATT: 17? His spell DC is 18, unfortunately. On a
failed save, you have a disadvantage on attack

04:02:19.504 --> 04:02:23.759
rolls and ability checks, and you can't take
reactions until the end of your next turn, so you

04:02:23.759 --> 04:02:25.135
can't Counterspell.

04:02:25.135 --> 04:02:26.859
TALIESIN: Scanlan's getting whaled on.

04:02:26.859 --> 04:02:30.223
SAM: Disadvantage on all attack rolls?

04:02:30.223 --> 04:02:34.077
MATT: Oh, but that's a concentration spell, so
he's not going to maintain the concentration. You

04:02:34.077 --> 04:02:38.915
take the damage, and he lets it go. You don't have
a disadvantage. Otherwise, he would lose other

04:02:38.915 --> 04:02:40.215
bits of concentration.

04:02:40.215 --> 04:02:42.160
LAURA: Other bits of concentration.

04:02:42.160 --> 04:02:48.314
MATT: All right, so that brings us to Vex. Your
turn.

04:02:48.314 --> 04:02:50.574
LAURA: (laughing) I get to go?

04:02:50.574 --> 04:02:52.426
MATT: Yeah. Sorry!

04:02:52.426 --> 04:02:53.812
SAM: You're alive.

04:02:53.812 --> 04:02:58.066
MATT: Sorry, guys. You walked into the lion's
den.

04:02:58.066 --> 04:02:59.881
LAURA: Oh yeah, we did.

04:02:59.881 --> 04:03:01.714
LIAM: I never did a single thing in this fight.

04:03:01.714 --> 04:03:07.581
LAURA: I know. This is the first thing I've done.
I stand up.

04:03:07.581 --> 04:03:12.094
TALIESIN: If we're smart--

04:03:12.094 --> 04:03:13.740
MARISHA: I can bring you back.

04:03:13.740 --> 04:03:19.223
TALIESIN: I'm heading towards where you are. I'm
heading towards the deceased body of Delilah.

04:03:19.223 --> 04:03:33.013
LAURA: I'm going to, as a bonus action, down my
biggest healing potion, which is one greater

04:03:33.013 --> 04:03:34.648
healing potion.

04:03:34.648 --> 04:03:36.059
MATT: Go for it.

04:03:36.059 --> 04:03:41.241
LIAM: There's also a superior healing potion lying
on the ground amongst all my shit.

04:03:41.241 --> 04:03:43.897
LAURA: No. It's in your armor.

04:03:43.897 --> 04:03:47.375
MATT: Greater is 4d4 plus four.

04:03:47.375 --> 04:03:49.351
SAM: Okay, it's something.

04:03:49.351 --> 04:04:10.557
LAURA: 13 plus four is 17 healing points, and I'm
going to move closer to Keyleth.

04:04:10.557 --> 04:04:15.480
TALIESIN: She can move to us. Never mind.

04:04:15.480 --> 04:04:18.639
MARISHA: We have to all be holding hands, y'all.

04:04:18.639 --> 04:04:24.057
LAURA: Can I put myself in between Percy and
Keyleth so I can reach my hand out?

04:04:24.057 --> 04:04:28.574
TALIESIN: I'm going to be making a beeline for
everybody else. Everybody's in that big clump.

04:04:28.574 --> 04:04:32.009
LAURA: We're all in a clump, so we can still
touch? I don't need to move anywhere in order to

04:04:32.009 --> 04:04:34.575
be able to touch her?

04:04:34.575 --> 04:04:36.986
TALIESIN: You'll be able to move before you cast
Plane Shift, right?

04:04:36.986 --> 04:04:37.842
MARISHA: Yes.

04:04:37.842 --> 04:04:44.158
TALIESIN: So as long as we're all touching, she
can get to us. We just need to clump, and I move

04:04:44.158 --> 04:04:48.009
last, so I'm fine. Is that right? Yeah, I move
last.

04:04:48.009 --> 04:04:53.065
MATT: Keyleth moves last. Keyleth and Scanlan.

04:04:53.065 --> 04:04:59.360
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to shoot at the death
knight.

04:04:59.360 --> 04:05:00.687
MATT: Go for it.

04:05:00.687 --> 04:05:09.945
LAURA: With my 21?

04:05:09.945 --> 04:05:11.666
MATT: 21 actually hits.

04:05:11.666 --> 04:05:18.434
LAURA: With my Blazing Bowstring, and I want to
make it a bramble shot.

04:05:18.434 --> 04:05:20.732
TRAVIS: Hit him hard.

04:05:20.732 --> 04:05:25.823
LAURA: Is anybody standing next to him?

04:05:25.823 --> 04:05:28.444
MATT: Scanlan and Keyleth.

04:05:28.444 --> 04:05:29.746
LAURA: Sweet.

04:05:29.746 --> 04:05:33.701
MARISHA: Feel free to hit me. I don't care. I
can't be grappled.

04:05:33.701 --> 04:05:36.547
TALIESIN: Doesn't matter. She just gets extra
points--

04:05:36.547 --> 04:05:38.834
MARISHA: Oh, he's flanked.

04:05:38.834 --> 04:05:59.183
LAURA: 23 plus eight is 31, right? 33 plus 1d6
lightning damage. 39, and then 3d6 sneak attack.

04:05:59.183 --> 04:06:01.986
11 additional, so that's--

04:06:01.986 --> 04:06:03.389
TRAVIS: 50.

04:06:03.389 --> 04:06:10.517
LAURA: Oh, and the Blazing Bowstring. Six
additional from that.

04:06:10.517 --> 04:06:17.814
MATT: 56 points of damage from one shot. That is a
23 on his strength save, so as the arrow hits, you

04:06:17.814 --> 04:06:22.440
see the burst of flame. It pierces the armor, and
you see the brambles extend and tear around him.

04:06:22.440 --> 04:06:28.449
He looks up at you and you watch as flames (fire
noises) burn out of the armor. The arrow burns

04:06:28.449 --> 04:06:33.185
away, and the brambles ignite and fafll to ash
around him.

04:06:33.185 --> 04:06:35.677
LAURA: Not surprising. What about his
concentration?

04:06:35.677 --> 04:06:37.292
TALIESIN: Come on.

04:06:37.292 --> 04:06:46.268
MATT: That's going to be... half of 56? Oh man,
he's going to have to roll really high.

04:06:46.268 --> 04:06:49.431
TALIESIN and MARISHA: No!

04:06:49.431 --> 04:06:52.104
MATT: Hold on. Half of 56 is--

04:06:52.104 --> 04:06:53.539
SAM: 28.

04:06:53.539 --> 04:06:57.336
MATT: 28. No, he rolled a 19 plus five.

04:06:57.336 --> 04:07:01.983
(cheering)

04:07:01.983 --> 04:07:08.542
MATT: As the flames ignite and burn around, the
impact still causes him to lose the spell, and you

04:07:08.542 --> 04:07:18.505
watch as a vacuum fills, and Grog, just as you see
this barrage of gloom stalkers, ready to grab and

04:07:18.505 --> 04:07:24.751
tear you apart, you (poof) out and then (whoosh)
appear in that space where you once were.

04:07:24.751 --> 04:07:27.360
TRAVIS: Huh?

04:07:27.360 --> 04:07:31.339
ASHLEY: Grog! You're back!

04:07:31.339 --> 04:07:33.172
MARISHA: Grog, we've got to get out!

04:07:33.172 --> 04:07:35.855
MATT: All right, that ends your turn, Vex?

04:07:35.855 --> 04:07:37.394
LAURA: No, I get to attack him again.

04:07:37.394 --> 04:07:38.439
MATT: Go for it.

04:07:38.439 --> 04:07:40.887
TALIESIN: We're in a nice little clump, aren't
we?

04:07:40.887 --> 04:07:52.285
LAURA: That one definitely hits. This is way less
damage. 20 damage on the second one.

04:07:52.285 --> 04:07:58.511
MATT: All righty. You can sense there's shadow and
smoke pouring out from under the armor as the

04:07:58.511 --> 04:08:03.591
frustration of lost concentration is there. The
second arrow hits the shoulder. Staring straight

04:08:03.591 --> 04:08:05.006
at you, angrily.

04:08:05.006 --> 04:08:07.047
LAURA: Keyleth, get us out of here?

04:08:07.047 --> 04:08:08.767
MARISHA: Hold hands.

04:08:08.767 --> 04:08:13.010
TALIESIN: I think we're all in physical contact,
at this point, except for me.

04:08:13.010 --> 04:08:15.161
MATT: That ends Vex's turn?

04:08:15.161 --> 04:08:16.893
LAURA: Where's Vax?

04:08:16.893 --> 04:08:18.633
TALIESIN: Well...

04:08:18.633 --> 04:08:20.522
MARISHA: We'll talk later!

04:08:20.522 --> 04:08:23.177
TALIESIN: Working on it. Do you have all of his
stuff?

04:08:23.177 --> 04:08:24.892
SAM: As much as I can carry.

04:08:24.892 --> 04:08:28.657
MATT: Armor, daggers. Roll an investigation
check.

04:08:28.657 --> 04:08:29.901
MARISHA: Dust?

04:08:29.901 --> 04:08:32.833
LIAM: Boots, his voice says from beyond the
grave.

04:08:32.833 --> 04:08:36.075
SAM: 30.

04:08:36.075 --> 04:08:40.773
MATT: You rustled through the dust when you went
through and spent the turn grabbing what you can.

04:08:40.773 --> 04:08:43.578
You get most of his important magical items.

04:08:43.578 --> 04:08:44.844
MARISHA: And dust.

04:08:44.844 --> 04:08:46.449
MATT: And a little bit of dust.

04:08:46.449 --> 04:08:47.957
SAM: Those boots are gone!

04:08:47.957 --> 04:08:53.399
TALIESIN: Next time we fight Vecna, he's going to
be wearing some very nice boots.

04:08:53.399 --> 04:08:54.262
LAURA: No.

04:08:54.262 --> 04:08:55.624
TALIESIN: I'm kidding.

04:08:55.624 --> 04:08:58.489
LIAM: He'll be Finger of Deathing me double-time.

04:08:58.489 --> 04:09:02.681
ASHLEY: Are we trying to get out of here? What are
we doing?

04:09:02.681 --> 04:09:04.014
TALIESIN: We are trying to get out of here.

04:09:04.014 --> 04:09:07.849
ASHLEY: But then what?! We still have to fight
him!

04:09:07.849 --> 04:09:11.305
LAURA: Yeah, but then we'll be able to recover a
little bit and figure out what we're doing.

04:09:11.305 --> 04:09:12.687
TALIESIN: We're going to die here.

04:09:12.687 --> 04:09:22.076
ASHLEY: Okay, I'll run to-- sorry, I'm stuttering.
Keyleth's doing it?

04:09:22.076 --> 04:09:27.244
TALIESIN: As long as we're all touching, it
doesn't matter where Keyleth is, but Turn Undead

04:09:27.244 --> 04:09:28.647
would help, maybe?

04:09:28.647 --> 04:09:30.672
LAURA: Or heal us.

04:09:30.672 --> 04:09:32.326
TALIESIN: Healing or Turn Undead.

04:09:32.326 --> 04:09:33.912
ASHLEY: When's your turn up?

04:09:33.912 --> 04:09:37.376
TALIESIN: I'm coming up, right?

04:09:37.376 --> 04:09:39.286
LAURA: And you're holding your action, Keyleth?

04:09:39.286 --> 04:09:41.279
MATT: Yes, after Pike's turn.

04:09:41.279 --> 04:09:53.437
ASHLEY: Okay. I'm going to do Mass Cure Wounds at
6th level. Let's see.

04:09:53.437 --> 04:10:02.467
TALIESIN: I'm going to use the ring of counting.
This is actually proving to be invaluable.

04:10:02.467 --> 04:10:06.267
MARISHA: It's very handy.

04:10:06.267 --> 04:10:10.505
LAURA: What? What did you just think of?

04:10:10.505 --> 04:10:13.571
TRAVIS: Nothing.

04:10:13.571 --> 04:10:17.090
TALIESIN: Later. We need a bigger boat.

04:10:17.090 --> 04:10:23.263
ASHLEY: Fuck, this is a bad roll.

04:10:23.263 --> 04:10:26.572
SAM: Is this a new round since my last
Counterspell?

04:10:26.572 --> 04:10:32.911
MATT: What was the last one you countered and
failed? That was on Vecna's turn, so when it comes

04:10:32.911 --> 04:10:34.490
back to your turn, it will be.

04:10:34.490 --> 04:10:36.097
TALIESIN: Not yet.

04:10:36.097 --> 04:10:39.647
ASHLEY: 26 points. I rolled so badly.

04:10:39.647 --> 04:10:41.404
LAURA: 26 is great.

04:10:41.404 --> 04:11:05.426
ASHLEY: And then... am I able to also, at this
point, see if I can channel divinity?

04:11:05.426 --> 04:11:07.505
MATT: It's an action to do that.

04:11:07.505 --> 04:11:22.141
ASHLEY: It's not like she's going to show up.
Okay. Sorry. I'm so hot.

04:11:22.141 --> 04:11:27.436
SAM: That's what I say to myself every morning.

04:11:27.436 --> 04:11:30.290
LIAM: Your extensions look good, but I feel like
that is...

04:11:30.290 --> 04:11:37.745
ASHLEY: Okay. I'm just hanging out.

04:11:37.745 --> 04:11:40.004
MATT: Okay. That's Pike's turn.

04:11:40.004 --> 04:11:44.818
MARISHA: Are we all holding hands? Are we all in
position?

04:11:44.818 --> 04:11:46.858
SAM: Wait, did you just cure our wounds?

04:11:46.858 --> 04:11:48.701
TALIESIN: Yeah, we just got 26 points back.

04:11:48.701 --> 04:11:54.523
ASHLEY: Wait. Can I do a Mass Healing Word as my
bonus action?

04:11:54.523 --> 04:11:59.410
MATT: What level? No, because you already did a
higher-level. You can't do that, unfortunately.

04:11:59.410 --> 04:12:01.459
SAM: You can do it to one person.

04:12:01.459 --> 04:12:06.231
ASHLEY: I'll do one person. Who's closest to me?

04:12:06.231 --> 04:12:08.025
TALIESIN: She's probably at the bottom.

04:12:08.025 --> 04:12:11.057
ASHLEY: Where are you at? Oh yeah, you're nothing.
Let me do the Healing Word.

04:12:11.057 --> 04:12:13.230
LAURA: You're nothing! You're nobody!

04:12:13.230 --> 04:12:16.277
TRAVIS: You'll never mean nothing in this world!

04:12:16.277 --> 04:12:27.823
MATT: At the end of your turn, Pike, Vecna's going
to go ahead and cast-- you hear the voice enter

04:12:27.823 --> 04:12:38.283
your mind once more, Pike. "Don't worry. If you
love her that much, I'll send her to you." Make a

04:12:38.283 --> 04:12:39.681
dexterity saving throw.

04:12:39.681 --> 04:12:41.322
SAM: Oh no, dexterity.

04:12:41.322 --> 04:12:44.125
MATT: Let me see if it's dexterity or
constitution. Let me check real fast.

04:12:44.125 --> 04:12:46.772
LAURA: What's he doing?

04:12:46.772 --> 04:12:49.024
SAM: He's trying to hurt our Pikey.

04:12:49.024 --> 04:12:52.428
MATT: That is a dexterity. Make a dexterity saving
throw.

04:12:52.428 --> 04:12:59.755
ASHLEY: 16.

04:12:59.755 --> 04:13:03.440
TALIESIN: Nope.

04:13:03.440 --> 04:13:08.027
ASHLEY: I knew it was too low.

04:13:08.027 --> 04:13:10.047
MATT: All right. You take 78 points of force
damage.

04:13:10.047 --> 04:13:11.052
ASHLEY: How much?

04:13:11.052 --> 04:13:12.224
MATT: 78.

04:13:12.224 --> 04:13:18.591
ASHLEY: 78. Okay. That is okay. I'm unconscious--

04:13:18.591 --> 04:13:25.790
MATT: However, if it brings you to zero, it turns
you to dust.

04:13:25.790 --> 04:13:27.339
LAURA: But her armor!

04:13:27.339 --> 04:13:28.783
MATT: But the armor.

04:13:28.783 --> 04:13:30.306
TRAVIS: Oh!

04:13:30.306 --> 04:13:32.132
SAM: It never got her to zero.

04:13:32.132 --> 04:13:35.307
MATT: As soon as you hit zero, the armor flickers
in, and the divine--

04:13:35.307 --> 04:13:36.826
MARISHA: Oh my god.

04:13:36.826 --> 04:13:39.850
TALIESIN: Which also means that all the fucking
skeletons take damage!

04:13:39.850 --> 04:13:49.090
MATT: Yep. As the ray hits you and you feel your
flesh begin to dissipate, the blessing of Pelor

04:13:49.331 --> 04:13:55.585
and the guidance of Sarenrae flicker into you, and
you watch as light and flames (explosion noise)

04:13:55.585 --> 04:14:01.875
burst out of her like a Doctor regenerating. As
the fire consumes the area, roll your damage for

04:14:01.875 --> 04:14:05.897
your armor. Thank you for reminding me of that.

04:14:05.897 --> 04:14:07.557
TRAVIS: Plate of the Dawnmartyr, you guys.

04:14:07.557 --> 04:14:09.309
TALIESIN: I was about to say, I know the stats of
the Dawnmartyr

04:14:09.309 --> 04:14:11.655
really well right now, for reasons.

04:14:11.768 --> 04:14:13.342
TRAVIS: They take 6d6 fire damage.

04:14:13.342 --> 04:14:14.902
LAURA: 6d6 fire damage!

04:14:14.902 --> 04:14:16.828
TRAVIS: The ones within melee.

04:14:16.828 --> 04:14:20.370
MATT: To all hostile creatures, correct?

04:14:20.370 --> 04:14:21.349
TALIESIN: Yep.

04:14:21.349 --> 04:14:22.589
MATT: Not all creatures?

04:14:22.589 --> 04:14:23.904
LAURA: All hostile.

04:14:23.904 --> 04:14:25.579
MATT: That's a very important distinction.

04:14:25.579 --> 04:14:28.679
LAURA: That was terrible!

04:14:28.679 --> 04:14:36.238
ASHLEY: 14. You know what? It's fine. I'm alive.

04:14:36.238 --> 04:14:42.317
MATT: Okay, so as the flames burn out, you watch
as the skeletons that catch flame, their bone

04:14:42.317 --> 04:14:52.176
burning to black, but they're still standing.
Okay. That brings us to Percy.

04:14:52.176 --> 04:14:54.972
ASHLEY: Nothing is going well!

04:14:54.972 --> 04:14:57.876
TALIESIN: Are we a reasonable chain?

04:14:57.876 --> 04:15:00.399
LAURA: Yeah, we're just waiting on you to make the
touch.

04:15:00.399 --> 04:15:07.087
TALIESIN: There's nobody breaking the chain? I'm
going to move six points in the direction of

04:15:07.087 --> 04:15:14.446
Delilah because I'm going to bring her with me
because I don't want that dead body there. Do I

04:15:14.446 --> 04:15:19.970
make it in six moves? And while I'm running, just
for fucking fun, I'm going to take three shots at

04:15:19.970 --> 04:15:24.216
that armor, and I'm going to push him the fuck
back, if that's okay. I'm going to push that

04:15:24.216 --> 04:15:26.921
knight back. I'm going to try and do a force
push.

04:15:26.921 --> 04:15:29.017
LAURA: And you're saving your action until we're
all touching?

04:15:29.017 --> 04:15:34.999
TALIESIN: Yeah. It's about to be. We're all
touching. Let's get rid of that fucker.

04:15:34.999 --> 04:15:38.446
MARISHA: We are getting out of here, right?

04:15:38.446 --> 04:15:40.200
TALIESIN: We're getting the fuck out of here.

04:15:40.200 --> 04:15:42.084
LAURA: Oh, I thought you were saving your action.

04:15:42.084 --> 04:15:45.682
MARISHA: I rolled a really fucking shitty
initiative.

04:15:45.682 --> 04:15:54.427
TALIESIN: That's a 27 to hit? The knight.

04:15:54.427 --> 04:15:55.956
MATT: That hits, yes.

04:15:55.956 --> 04:16:04.294
TALIESIN: Okay, and that's a torso push. I'm only
going to take the one shot. I don't even care

04:16:04.294 --> 04:16:06.589
anymore; I'm just pushing him away.

04:16:06.589 --> 04:16:07.764
MATT: He's pushed ten feet?

04:16:07.764 --> 04:16:09.338
TALIESIN: He's pushed ten feet back from my
position.

04:16:09.338 --> 04:16:10.733
MATT: Does he make a save for that?

04:16:10.733 --> 04:16:16.799
TALIESIN: There's no save for that, and then he
takes a disturbingly sad nine points of damage,

04:16:16.799 --> 04:16:24.356
plus six points psychic damage. But he's ten feet
back. We're all touching. I'm going to save the

04:16:24.356 --> 04:16:28.286
rest of my attack for anybody who tries to get in
the way of this shit. If anybody interrupts us,

04:16:28.286 --> 04:16:33.318
I've got two more shots ready to go. Also burning
a heal for fun, as well.

04:16:33.318 --> 04:16:34.882
MATT: Scanlan, you're up.

04:16:34.882 --> 04:16:40.297
SAM: I will Lightning Bolt at level four the armor
knight guy.

04:16:40.297 --> 04:16:42.506
TALIESIN: I'm also holding onto Delilah.

04:16:42.506 --> 04:16:45.201
SAM: He's behind me, so I'll do it from my ass.

04:16:45.201 --> 04:16:49.554
(laughter)

04:16:49.554 --> 04:16:54.204
LIAM: I love you so much.

04:16:54.204 --> 04:16:59.050
SAM: I'll lift up my leg a little bit. Squeeze it
out.

04:16:59.050 --> 04:17:00.911
LIAM: Like a dog at a fire hydrant.

04:17:00.911 --> 04:17:07.359
SAM: It's 8d6, but at level four it's 9d6, I
think?

04:17:07.359 --> 04:17:14.108
MATT: Level four, it's 9d6, yeah. He did not make
his save. He rolled a nine plus six. 15.

04:17:14.108 --> 04:17:20.288
TALIESIN: Yay! I'm not quite at full.

04:17:20.288 --> 04:17:25.107
MATT: He has advantage on his saves against
magical effects and spells. He rolled worse.

04:17:25.107 --> 04:17:27.135
SAM: 35.

04:17:27.135 --> 04:17:33.386
MATT: 35 points of damage. The bolt (lightning
noise) through him at the same time he's blasted

04:17:33.386 --> 04:17:39.917
back by Percy's hit and skids. You see the smoke
rise up. Like the Terminator,

04:17:39.917 --> 04:17:41.337
he keeps moving forward.

04:17:41.337 --> 04:17:48.220
SAM: I'll use my movement to gather whatever bits
of Vax I can still see.

04:17:48.220 --> 04:17:49.655
TALIESIN: Put your hands in it.

04:17:49.655 --> 04:17:51.244
SAM: And get into "posish."

04:17:51.244 --> 04:17:53.484
TALIESIN: We're ready to burn.

04:17:53.484 --> 04:18:05.613
SAM: I will bonus action Healing Word Pikey-poo,
which is for me-- what is Healing Word?

04:18:05.613 --> 04:18:09.141
It's 2d4 plus six?

04:18:09.141 --> 04:18:11.568
MATT: Yes.

04:18:11.568 --> 04:18:17.229
SAM: Ten.

04:18:17.229 --> 04:18:20.024
MATT: At the end of Scanlan's turn--

04:18:20.024 --> 04:18:21.902
TALIESIN: Fuck no!

04:18:21.902 --> 04:18:27.559
TRAVIS: Let's just have a conversation about this.
We're adults.

04:18:27.559 --> 04:18:30.446
LAURA: What is this game, Matthew? Don't do it!

04:18:30.446 --> 04:18:35.791
MATT: He is going to take a shot at Pike with a
Firebolt cantrip.

04:18:35.791 --> 04:18:38.581
TALIESIN: You have a reaction.

04:18:38.581 --> 04:18:41.377
SAM: I do, but I want to save it.

04:18:41.377 --> 04:18:42.597
ASHLEY: Bob and weave. I can bob and weave.

04:18:42.597 --> 04:18:44.998
TALIESIN: There's no save. This is it.

04:18:44.998 --> 04:18:52.387
SAM: Do people have to be alive to get out of
here?

04:18:52.387 --> 04:18:56.099
MATT: That is a 21. What's your armor class?

04:18:56.099 --> 04:18:57.991
ASHLEY: 23.

04:18:57.991 --> 04:19:00.135
TRAVIS: It doesn't even hit!

04:19:00.135 --> 04:19:02.424
LIAM: Eat a dick!

04:19:02.424 --> 04:19:05.401
ASHLEY: Eat a bag of dicks!

04:19:05.401 --> 04:19:07.653
TRAVIS: At level five?

04:19:07.653 --> 04:19:14.206
MATT: I rolled a five. It's a cantrip. It fires
the bolt towards you; you're barely holding on. As

04:19:14.206 --> 04:19:22.910
you turn around, the flame hits you, but your
armor absorbs it. No impact. Okay.

04:19:22.910 --> 04:19:25.545
LAURA: I need Taco Bell right now in my life!

04:19:25.545 --> 04:19:30.039
ASHLEY: I know. I want Taco Bell so bad. We might
have cheats tonight.

04:19:30.039 --> 04:19:34.043
MATT: That's the end of Scanlan's turn. Keyleth?

04:19:34.043 --> 04:19:35.037
MARISHA: Are we all here?

04:19:35.037 --> 04:19:35.796
TALIESIN: We're all here.

04:19:35.796 --> 04:19:37.904
MARISHA: We're all sure about this? We're out?
100%?

04:19:37.904 --> 04:19:39.236
TALIESIN: We're dying.

04:19:39.236 --> 04:19:40.555
TRAVIS: No, let's stay and fight.

04:19:40.555 --> 04:19:42.539
MARISHA: We're on this plane, right?

04:19:42.539 --> 04:19:44.528
TRAVIS: Yeah, we're on the material plane.

04:19:44.528 --> 04:19:48.511
MARISHA: Then we're going to the Feywild! And we
all hold hands--

04:19:48.511 --> 04:19:51.227
MATT: Are you turning back to your form, then?

04:19:51.227 --> 04:19:56.934
MARISHA: Yes, I drop form and I pull out my tuning
fork and my flowers, and I think deep about the

04:19:56.934 --> 04:20:03.943
Gilded Run and the Shademirk Bog and the beautiful
pond that we appeared around, that we know there's

04:20:03.943 --> 04:20:07.885
a portal right near it. That's what I think about
strongly, and I say,

04:20:07.885 --> 04:20:09.721
everyone think about the pretty ponds!

04:20:09.721 --> 04:20:11.888
LIAM: Feywild Spring Break, motherfuckers!

04:20:11.888 --> 04:20:14.698
MARISHA: Spring Break 2017, Feywild!

04:20:14.698 --> 04:20:18.767
TALIESIN: Roll. You're a good man.

04:20:18.767 --> 04:20:24.560
MATT: Vecna's going to attempt to Counterspell.

04:20:24.560 --> 04:20:27.780
SAM: Yep. 7th-level Counterspell against him.

04:20:27.780 --> 04:20:32.649
(laughter)

04:20:32.649 --> 04:20:35.083
TRAVIS: I knew that's what you were waiting for!

04:20:35.083 --> 04:20:41.623
MATT: That was some old-school Magic: The
Gathering shit, right there.

04:20:41.623 --> 04:20:45.143
LIAM: Do it, Scanlan. Do it.

04:20:45.143 --> 04:20:47.134
ASHLEY: You just pulled out the wild Uno card.

04:20:47.134 --> 04:20:50.184
(laughter)

04:20:50.184 --> 04:20:51.687
TALIESIN: We're not happy yet.

04:20:51.687 --> 04:21:02.229
MATT: So 7th-level Counterspell. Yeah, you don't
have to roll.

04:21:02.229 --> 04:21:04.312
(cheering)

04:21:04.312 --> 04:21:12.879
MATT: Yeah. Let me check real fast. I need to
confirm this real fast.

04:21:12.879 --> 04:21:15.568
LAURA: Scanlan's back.

04:21:15.568 --> 04:21:17.087
LIAM: Shorthalt's back.

04:21:17.087 --> 04:21:20.274
TRAVIS: "I'd rather not use it."

04:21:20.274 --> 04:21:28.385
MATT: Yeah, no. The only spell he even had left to
Counterspell was 7th level. Yeah, (poof).

04:21:28.385 --> 04:21:30.402
SAM: Let's go.

04:21:30.402 --> 04:21:38.414
MATT: As the glyph of shattering begins to
coalesce around his fingers in one hand and the

04:21:38.414 --> 04:21:42.502
wrist on the other, you strike up a Counterspell
of your own.

04:21:42.502 --> 04:21:51.453
SAM: Sure. I will say to him, this time-- I've got
nothing left. I will sing to him, (singing) I'm

04:21:51.453 --> 04:22:08.209
beautiful. I'm beautiful, it's true. You saw my
face in a crowded place, and you didn't know what

04:22:08.209 --> 04:22:12.114
to do because I just took a shit on you.

04:22:12.114 --> 04:22:14.869
ASHLEY: Oh my god.

04:22:14.869 --> 04:22:23.014
MATT: The last thing you hear as the spell begins
to take effect is the whispered voice of Vecna

04:22:23.014 --> 04:22:27.824
throughout all of your heads say, "What?"

04:22:27.824 --> 04:22:30.001
(laughter)

04:22:30.001 --> 04:22:37.218
MATT: Before (spell noise) you are all yanked
through a familiar tunnel of darkness and then

04:22:37.218 --> 04:22:46.262
thrust out into the center of a clustered, dense
forest in the Feywild.

04:22:46.262 --> 04:22:49.437
SAM: Oh god. Have I been there? Wait, was that me?
Yes. Okay.

04:22:49.437 --> 04:22:57.081
MARISHA: I'm sorry. I would have taken us home,
but we were already there, and I had to go

04:22:57.081 --> 04:22:59.038
somewhere else.

04:22:59.038 --> 04:23:00.455
LAURA: Where's Vax?

04:23:00.455 --> 04:23:01.991
MATT: And that's where we're going to end.

04:23:01.991 --> 04:23:04.275
(groaning)

04:23:04.275 --> 04:23:13.281
LIAM: (fake crying) You sadistic motherfucker! You
cut it right there?! I was okay until right then!

04:23:13.281 --> 04:23:16.279
TALIESIN: That's not nice.

04:23:16.279 --> 04:23:19.836
MATT: I'm so sorry.

04:23:19.836 --> 04:23:23.793
TALIESIN: Nothing feels good.

04:23:23.793 --> 04:23:26.705
LIAM: I was okay until right then!

04:23:26.705 --> 04:23:31.806
ASHLEY: Let's do one more hour.

04:23:31.806 --> 04:23:40.655
TRAVIS: That was amazing. That was brutal. We
didn't have a fucking chance.

04:23:40.655 --> 04:23:42.849
TALIESIN: No, there was not a fucking prayer.

04:23:42.849 --> 04:23:49.795
LIAM: What else were we going to do? Set up an
Orange Julius stand by that tower? Of course we

04:23:49.795 --> 04:23:51.526
were going to go into that tower.

04:23:51.526 --> 04:23:55.365
TRAVIS: Of course! But we didn't know how fucked
we were until we got up there. We had to go.

04:23:55.365 --> 04:23:59.115
MARISHA: I thought that we were pretty badass when
we took the tower down, and we were not.

04:23:59.115 --> 04:24:01.503
ASHLEY: No.

04:24:01.503 --> 04:24:06.661
MARISHA: I can get you back, man. I can get you
fucking back!

04:24:06.661 --> 04:24:08.487
SAM: Can you? Without a body?

04:24:08.487 --> 04:24:11.309
MATT: We're going to have some discussions.

04:24:11.309 --> 04:24:13.368
SAM: Without a body?

04:24:13.368 --> 04:24:16.834
MARISHA: But True Resurrection says I can.

04:24:16.834 --> 04:24:26.470
MATT: Marisha. We'll have some discussions.
Anyway. Thank you guys so much for watching.

04:24:26.470 --> 04:24:35.284
Thanks for kicking in for a taste of the final
arc. Holy shit.

04:24:35.284 --> 04:24:38.865
TALIESIN: You know what, I'm grateful that we're
not--

04:24:38.865 --> 04:24:47.884
MATT: Oh man. There was part of me, where either
they were going to end up waiting-- if that didn't

04:24:47.884 --> 04:24:52.370
break concentration, they were either going to
wait for you and probably lose a lot more,

04:24:52.370 --> 04:24:57.727
possibly Keyleth once she realized what was going
on. Or left without you.

04:24:57.727 --> 04:24:59.404
You would have come back.

04:24:59.404 --> 04:25:01.510
LAURA: And we would have been gone.

04:25:01.510 --> 04:25:05.798
TRAVIS: And I would have to have won the game all by
myself.

04:25:05.798 --> 04:25:07.849
SAM: Which you've already done.

04:25:07.849 --> 04:25:12.767
TRAVIS: Or I would have taken the Deck and been
like--

04:25:12.767 --> 04:25:22.750
LIAM: Number one lesson. The one takeaway tonight.
The one takeaway is just how OP Vax'ildan is.

04:25:22.750 --> 04:25:26.044
(laughter)

04:25:26.044 --> 04:25:27.325
MATT: This is true.

04:25:27.325 --> 04:25:28.862
LAURA: If he can't move, he's fucked.

04:25:28.862 --> 04:25:30.278
TRAVIS: Boots no longer.

04:25:30.278 --> 04:25:33.181
MARISHA: I can't believe I fucking dumped my
9th-level spell in you, and then you got tied

04:25:33.181 --> 04:25:35.489
down. It made zero fucking difference.

04:25:35.489 --> 04:25:37.709
LIAM: You did great.

04:25:37.709 --> 04:25:39.722
MARISHA: We both wasted our fucking 9th-level
spells.

04:25:39.722 --> 04:25:42.183
SAM: They're hard to use. We've got to learn to
use them better.

04:25:42.183 --> 04:25:45.307
LIAM: You've got one chance to do something
fucking amazing.

04:25:45.307 --> 04:25:49.352
LAURA: Vecna is out and ready to fucking destroy.

04:25:49.352 --> 04:25:52.426
MATT: We'll pick up on this next week.

04:25:52.426 --> 04:25:54.820
SAM: Wow. I'm shaking.

04:25:54.820 --> 04:26:01.548
MATT: Me, too. All right, guys. Thank you so much.
Have a wonderful night. We'll see you soon, and is

04:26:01.548 --> 04:26:02.953
it Thursday yet?

04:26:02.953 --> 04:26:04.681
TRAVIS: Nope! It's Thursday right now!

04:26:04.681 --> 04:26:06.134
LIAM: Last Thursday.

04:26:06.134 --> 04:26:07.233
MATT: Good night, guys.

04:26:07.233 --> 04:32:19.641
