00:00:00.487 --> 00:00:04.172
MATT: Welcome back to Critical Role this week,
ladies and gentlemen, where a bunch of us awesome

00:00:04.172 --> 00:00:08.885
voice actors get together and play Dungeons and
Dragons weekly. We have the return of some of our

00:00:08.885 --> 00:00:13.698
fantastic guests from last week, but we'll get to
them in just a second. But first, let's go ahead

00:00:13.698 --> 00:00:17.138
and get you started with our fancy intro.

00:00:17.138 --> 00:01:26.384
[dramatic music]

00:01:26.384 --> 00:01:35.604
MATT: Welcome back! (giggles) Welcome back. We got
most everyone here right now. Travis is on his

00:01:35.604 --> 00:01:41.831
way. He flew all the way from Alaska, and thanks
to some delays-- weather and everything-- he's

00:01:41.831 --> 00:01:45.646
getting here as fast as he can, so we may have a
Grog arriving a little late during today's

00:01:45.646 --> 00:01:51.043
session. &nbsp;Pretty late for today's session. But in
the meantime, our illustrious Laura Bailey will be

00:01:51.043 --> 00:01:52.722
controlling Grog.

00:01:52.722 --> 00:01:55.828
LAURA: (Grog voice) I would like to rage!

00:01:55.828 --> 00:02:02.223
MATT: Excited for that prospect. It should be a
lot of fun. So also want to thank you again, our

00:02:02.223 --> 00:02:07.909
invited guests returning for their second week. We
have Felicia Day and Mary Elizabeth McGlynn. Thank

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:09.218
you, guys.

00:02:09.218 --> 00:02:10.552
MARY: Pleasure is mine.

00:02:10.552 --> 00:02:12.218
LAURA and MARY: Pleasure.

00:02:12.218 --> 00:02:14.164
FELICIA: Pleasure. I smell like peanut butter.

00:02:14.164 --> 00:02:15.264
MATT: That's delightful.

00:02:15.264 --> 00:02:17.124
FELICIA: That's why I smelled my fingers earlier.

00:02:17.124 --> 00:02:21.060
MARY: Is this a normal thing, or just today?

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.212
FELICIA: I just was like, hi! (sniffs)

00:02:23.212 --> 00:02:26.380
SAM: That's normally how people greet me.

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:34.770
FELICIA: If you smelled like grape jelly, we would
be BFFs! Anyway, hi.

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:43.269
MATT: So welcome back. Well, cool. Before we get
into it, a couple of quick announcements. One. For

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:47.335
every 100 subs that we get during the show
tonight, we'll be giving away our packages that

00:02:47.335 --> 00:02:52.658
include a picture of the Critical Role cast,
signed, a Player's Handbook for Dungeons and

00:02:52.658 --> 00:02:56.903
Dragons, signed by the cast of Critical Role.
We'll also be giving away a copy of Felicia's

00:02:56.903 --> 00:02:59.169
awesome new book that she's about to go on a book
tour for.

00:02:59.169 --> 00:03:01.226
(cheering)

00:03:01.226 --> 00:03:05.424
SAM: And it doesn't look like some self-published
thing, that looks like a real-- whoa!

00:03:05.424 --> 00:03:09.516
FELICIA: Not to insult self-published things, but
it's legit. There is a sparkle on my dress. That

00:03:09.516 --> 00:03:11.297
is a very high-class sparkle.

00:03:11.297 --> 00:03:13.157
SAM: Does it have a barcode on it?

00:03:13.157 --> 00:03:19.223
FELICIA: That is an android, that's why I look so
trim there. Yeah, but the book's coming out on

00:03:19.223 --> 00:03:23.890
Tuesday! So I'll be going on book tour, so if you
guys want to come see me, I'm going to 12 cities.

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:28.950
Sorry Midwest. I'm sorry. You're so angry at me.
Anyway, thank you, yeah.

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:32.100
MATT: Awesome, cool, well you guys get some copies
of that coming through. We also have a bunch of

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:35.431
other random goodies we'll be throwing in with
these packages that include other awesome DND

00:03:35.431 --> 00:03:39.973
stuff and comics and it'll be a little surprise,
so for every 100 subscribers, we'll be giving one

00:03:39.973 --> 00:03:44.821
of those packages away, so that'll be fun. Also
wanted to do a quick announcement for one of our

00:03:44.821 --> 00:03:48.046
friends recently put up a project here. Marisha,
if you want to do the intro.

00:03:48.046 --> 00:03:54.240
MARISHA: Yes! Hi everybody. Okay, so. Boonzy
Arts-- they make geeky candles. They have a

00:03:54.240 --> 00:04:02.129
Kickstarter right now called Wheel of Flame, and
they're making essentially DND thematic immersive

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:11.362
candles that smell like the environments that
you're in! This one is Dragon's Lair and it's

00:04:11.362 --> 00:04:12.883
smoky and musky.

00:04:12.883 --> 00:04:14.567
MATT: We're going to be lighting this tonight.

00:04:14.567 --> 00:04:17.681
LAURA: Is there moldy dungeon smell?

00:04:17.681 --> 00:04:22.143
MARISHA: They're coming out with a few more
because their Kickstarter's doing pretty well.

00:04:22.143 --> 00:04:24.837
MATT: Basement tavern refuse candle.

00:04:24.837 --> 00:04:27.823
TALIESIN: Ogre's nest.

00:04:27.823 --> 00:04:29.789
MARISHA: I think they're making a tavern one.

00:04:29.789 --> 00:04:32.058
SAM: Bed crap?

00:04:32.058 --> 00:04:34.849
(laughter)

00:04:34.849 --> 00:04:36.775
MATT: That's a Critical Role exclusive. The
Scanlan offshoot.

00:04:36.775 --> 00:04:41.705
MARISHA: Yeah, I think they have one that's Elven
Forest, that smells like a forest and they have

00:04:41.705 --> 00:04:48.218
one that's Sorcerer's Lair, that smells like sage
and stuff. But yeah, Wheel of Flame is their

00:04:48.218 --> 00:04:53.156
Kickstarter. Go check them out, I know they have a
limited amount of candles they can give out. Also,

00:04:53.156 --> 00:05:01.438
there's a d20 hidden in every candle, so when the
wax melts, you get a d20!

00:05:01.438 --> 00:05:03.366
LAURA: That's lovely.

00:05:03.366 --> 00:05:05.132
MARISHA: So yeah! Check them out. Wheel of Flame.

00:05:05.132 --> 00:05:08.707
MATT: Great. Thank you, Marisha.

00:05:08.707 --> 00:05:11.762
(cheering)

00:05:11.762 --> 00:05:19.832
MATT: So much flame. So yeah, for all you guys who
pay the extra subscription dollars for the

00:05:19.832 --> 00:05:24.669
smell-o-vision twitch stream, you will be
able to also experience the

00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:27.095
sensory death of the party.

00:05:27.095 --> 00:05:29.396
LAURA: Why would you say that?

00:05:29.396 --> 00:05:35.118
MATT: You guys picked it. But yeah, so that's
actually pretty cool. Hopefully there's not a

00:05:35.118 --> 00:05:40.613
flammable d20 in there somewhere. That would be
problematic.

00:05:40.613 --> 00:05:43.342
FELICIA: That was weird.

00:05:43.342 --> 00:05:45.047
SAM: That happens all the time.

00:05:45.047 --> 00:05:47.372
FELICIA: Is it really just random kiss-bys?
Drive-by kiss?

00:05:47.372 --> 00:05:49.886
MATT: Two weeks in a row. We already have a
winner?

00:05:49.886 --> 00:05:51.328
ZAC: PrimeJohn1.

00:05:51.328 --> 00:05:54.427
MATT: PrimeJohn1 is our first winner!
Congratulations, PrimeJohn1.

00:05:54.427 --> 00:05:56.285
SAM: PJ Uno!

00:05:56.285 --> 00:05:59.537
FELICIA: Did you have to rename him?

00:05:59.537 --> 00:06:01.932
SAM: Well, I gave him a nickname to the nickname.

00:06:01.932 --> 00:06:04.484
FELICIA: That's really adorable. It's a
sub-nickname.

00:06:04.484 --> 00:06:06.263
SAM: A sub-nick!

00:06:06.263 --> 00:06:08.585
(laughter)

00:06:08.585 --> 00:06:13.285
FELICIA: It'll eventually just be like (grunts).

00:06:13.285 --> 00:06:20.989
MATT: Awesome, so let's go ahead and jump in here.
Anyone else have any other announcements they want

00:06:20.989 --> 00:06:23.637
to say before we get into the game?

00:06:23.637 --> 00:06:34.754
LAURA: Travis and I will be in Vancouver next
weekend. Not this coming weekend, but the weekend

00:06:34.754 --> 00:06:38.429
after. But we're not going to be here next week,
so yeah, should say that.

00:06:38.429 --> 00:06:39.754
MATT: Awesome, so in Vancouver?

00:06:39.754 --> 00:06:43.827
LAURA: It's a con. And you should come say hi.

00:06:43.827 --> 00:06:44.977
MATT: In Vancouver.

00:06:44.977 --> 00:06:48.193
LAURA: In Vancouver. Go look at my Twitter. You'll
see what it is about.

00:06:48.193 --> 00:06:53.460
MATT: There you go. Vancouver convention. Laura
and Travis; it's going to be awesome. Also, me and

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:59.567
Marisha are flying out early morning tomorrow to a
convention called AkaiCon that's over in

00:06:59.567 --> 00:07:03.082
Tennessee, so we'll be there this weekend. So if
any of you guys are over there on the eastern

00:07:03.082 --> 00:07:07.063
seaboard and that vicinity that want to come say
hi and hang out with us for the weekend, we have a

00:07:07.063 --> 00:07:09.673
bunch of fun panels and stuff, so. AkaiCon. Come
say hi.

00:07:09.673 --> 00:07:15.577
FELICIA: That smells delicious. I want to eat it.
Or is that you? No, it's not you.

00:07:15.577 --> 00:07:18.027
SAM: No, I rubbed peanut butter all over my
chest.

00:07:18.027 --> 00:07:19.869
(laughs)

00:07:19.869 --> 00:07:23.515
MATT: Homeopathic VapoRub, really.

00:07:23.515 --> 00:07:28.241
SAM: Oh wow, I do smell it now. Yeah, that's
nice.

00:07:28.241 --> 00:07:30.409
TALIESIN: Nothing fun right now.

00:07:30.409 --> 00:07:33.793
FELICIA: Does it smell like ogre butt, because
isn't that what we're doing? Troll butt?

00:07:33.793 --> 00:07:40.697
MATT: Oh, and I also wanted to give a big thanks
out to Obsidian! They actually approved my use of

00:07:40.697 --> 00:07:47.341
the Pillars of Eternity soundtrack in our music
for the show. So now I'll be able to use elements

00:07:47.341 --> 00:07:55.676
of their soundtrack for our game, so thank you
guys. And I guess, let's get into this game. So.

00:07:55.676 --> 00:08:04.481
Where we left off. Our party of adventurers, Vox
Machina, had broken a few rules in the city of

00:08:04.481 --> 00:08:12.868
Vasselheim and had actually infracted upon a
contract for a guild of creature hunters known as

00:08:12.868 --> 00:08:18.104
the Slayer's Take. And this group essentially told
Vox Machina that either they could go and be

00:08:18.104 --> 00:08:25.203
arrested for this and put on trial for breaking
the law, or they could go and join the guild, as

00:08:25.203 --> 00:08:28.466
such could be included and written onto the
contract and everything would be fine. So they

00:08:28.466 --> 00:08:36.470
decided to go that route. They inquired with the
Huntmaster, and she basically told the party that

00:08:36.470 --> 00:08:40.774
they could join after they went through a trial
where they had to complete a contract. However,

00:08:40.774 --> 00:08:45.078
she hand-chose and divided the party into two
separate, smaller groups. The first group being

00:08:45.078 --> 00:08:50.843
the one that began playing with us last week, in
which we had the illustrious Scanlan, Percy, Vex,

00:08:50.843 --> 00:08:58.175
and Grog paired up with two new adventurers, one
of which was Zahra the tiefling warlock, who also

00:08:58.175 --> 00:09:05.124
is a prospective interested person to join the
guild, the Slayer's Take, and Felicia's character,

00:09:05.124 --> 00:09:11.482
Lyra, the human wizard, who somehow became a
member of the guild and is assigned on her

00:09:11.482 --> 00:09:16.951
first-ever excursion to lead this group towards
the end of their contract. Now, you the audience

00:09:16.951 --> 00:09:23.656
chose the creature which they were going to hunt,
and you voted on an adult white dragon. So they've

00:09:23.656 --> 00:09:25.216
been hunting that.

00:09:25.216 --> 00:09:27.208
LAURA: I didn't realize the audience chose that.

00:09:27.208 --> 00:09:28.514
FELICIA: Thanks, guys.

00:09:28.514 --> 00:09:31.056
(laughter)

00:09:31.056 --> 00:09:35.504
MATT: So after stalking your way up the Glasswalk
Road to the north of the city of Vasselheim,

00:09:35.504 --> 00:09:39.918
through the Vesper Timberlands, through the cold
weather as you continue to travel northward on the

00:09:39.918 --> 00:09:46.416
word of a crazed gentleman in a tavern somewhere
who supposedly saw a dragon, you managed to knock

00:09:46.416 --> 00:09:54.651
over your flask. You managed to see such a dragon
skulking through the skies and actually attacking

00:09:54.651 --> 00:10:01.045
near where you were staying. While you were
sleeping, a group of orcs and some ogrish creature

00:10:01.045 --> 00:10:06.917
and a dire wolf, attacked your group, you managed
to slaughter the encroaching evils, rather rapidly

00:10:06.917 --> 00:10:11.545
in a daring display of butt-flap long-john Percy.

00:10:11.545 --> 00:10:15.160
(laughter)

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:19.510
MATT: Some majestic combat prowess you guys managed
to completely eliminate. You interrogated one of

00:10:19.510 --> 00:10:25.501
the orcs before Grog decided to take his head off.
It pushed you north, north-west direction within

00:10:25.501 --> 00:10:31.162
the forest itself. You managed to come upon what
looked to be a perpetual blizzard that was blowing

00:10:31.162 --> 00:10:36.178
around this mountain range, and the dragon was
sighted again taking its rest to the north part of

00:10:36.178 --> 00:10:40.351
this mountain. You pushed through the forest, managed
to avoid a few possible dangerous situations,

00:10:40.351 --> 00:10:46.704
thanks to your ranger guiding you through her
favored terrain, eventually coming upon the base

00:10:46.704 --> 00:10:49.860
of this mountain range. Now, you looked above and
you saw what looked like the entrance to a cavern

00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:54.551
where at least the dragon seems to fly in and out
of. It's a ways up the mountain, and there was a

00:10:54.551 --> 00:10:58.265
smaller cavern towards the base of the mountain.
You went to inquire what was in there, at which

00:10:58.265 --> 00:11:03.798
point out of nowhere, a giant rock made of solid
ice and stone was flung out of the forest,

00:11:03.798 --> 00:11:10.368
slamming into Vex, knocking her onto her ass and
doing a decent amount of physical damage.

00:11:10.368 --> 00:11:11.640
LAURA: 30. 30 points.

00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:17.578
MATT: 30 points physical damage to the ranger, at
which point two frost giants seemed to, one coming

00:11:17.578 --> 00:11:20.910
out of that cavern, another seemed to be
stalking through the woods, approached the party

00:11:20.954 --> 00:11:27.791
and that is where we left off. So to begin this, I
would like everyone to roll initiative.

00:11:27.791 --> 00:11:31.113
FELICIA: But they're friendly. They look
friendly.

00:11:31.113 --> 00:11:36.824
SAM: &nbsp;Let's try reasoning with them. Whoa! That's
not bad

00:11:36.824 --> 00:11:39.100
FELICIA: I'm not going to go last this time!
(gasps)

00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:42.568
SAM: There's a lot of gasping going on.

00:11:42.568 --> 00:11:45.358
FELICIA: It's not horrible but it's not (sharp
gasp).

00:11:45.358 --> 00:11:49.655
MATT: All right, so.

00:11:49.655 --> 00:11:51.461
SAM: Wait, does Travis not--

00:11:51.461 --> 00:11:52.932
MATT: Roll for Grog.

00:11:52.932 --> 00:11:54.236
LAURA: Roll for Grog.

00:11:54.236 --> 00:11:56.317
MATT: Roll for Grog's initiative.

00:11:56.317 --> 00:12:02.433
LAURA: I rolled 18 for me. Oh, that's good. 19 for
Grog.

00:12:02.433 --> 00:12:04.988
MATT: All right, so we have 25 to 20, anyone?

00:12:04.988 --> 00:12:06.073
TALIESIN: 28.

00:12:06.073 --> 00:12:07.285
LAURA: What?!

00:12:07.285 --> 00:12:09.633
SAM: He rolled a natural 20.

00:12:09.633 --> 00:12:11.333
TALIESIN: I rolled another natural 20.

00:12:11.333 --> 00:12:13.044
LAURA: Those dice are magic.

00:12:13.044 --> 00:12:16.859
TALIESIN: I sacrificed a small child to these
dice.

00:12:16.859 --> 00:12:22.863
MATT: So Percy's up first. Anybody else above 20?

00:12:22.863 --> 00:12:25.857
FELICIA: I rolled a 20, but I have a negative two
initiative.

00:12:26.001 --> 00:12:27.765
MATT: Okay. 19 or 18?

00:12:27.765 --> 00:12:30.413
LAURA: 19 for Grog. 18 for Vex.

00:12:30.413 --> 00:12:32.842
MATT: And also for Lyra.

00:12:32.842 --> 00:12:35.512
FELICIA: 18 buddies.

00:12:35.512 --> 00:12:41.966
MATT: (chuckling) That's sweet. So 15 to ten?

00:12:41.966 --> 00:12:43.373
SAM: 15.

00:12:43.373 --> 00:12:45.668
LAURA: These are pretty good initiatives.

00:12:45.668 --> 00:12:47.145
MARY: 13.

00:12:47.145 --> 00:12:51.495
SAM: Hey, then we're all above 13, it's pretty
good! This bodes well.

00:12:51.495 --> 00:12:53.627
MARY: I have no initiative whatsoever.

00:12:53.627 --> 00:12:55.414
(laughter)

00:12:55.414 --> 00:12:59.377
MATT: All right, that'll do. So at the top of the
round as one giant has pulled itself out of the

00:12:59.377 --> 00:13:03.809
cavern and begins shouting over in Giant about the
intruders. The secondary one that comes stalking

00:13:03.809 --> 00:13:07.374
out of the forest, both of them with these giant
axes that are currently held on the side of

00:13:07.374 --> 00:13:12.368
leather belts (roars) give a bellowing scream and
go charging into the fray. At the top of the

00:13:12.368 --> 00:13:14.521
round, though, Percy is ready. What have you got?

00:13:14.521 --> 00:13:18.768
TALIESIN: What is that strange orange thing, right
here?

00:13:18.768 --> 00:13:20.418
MATT: This is actually a tree.

00:13:20.418 --> 00:13:22.275
TALIESIN: That's a tree. Okay, good. So that's
cover?

00:13:22.275 --> 00:13:26.829
MATT: Yeah. This rock and these boulders here have
some cover, but from a giant who has a very large

00:13:26.829 --> 00:13:28.504
perspective maybe not as much as you'd think.

00:13:28.504 --> 00:13:32.584
TALIESIN: Okay, so is there any way I can maybe
get some partial cover right over here?

00:13:32.584 --> 00:13:35.587
MATT: You could move over this way, yes.

00:13:35.587 --> 00:13:41.095
TALIESIN: Yeah. So I've got cover from the tree
from this one until he moves,

00:13:41.265 --> 00:13:42.769
but I can see this guy?

00:13:42.769 --> 00:13:43.778
MATT: Correct.

00:13:43.778 --> 00:13:46.240
TALIESIN: It is Bad News time! I'm going to bust
out Bad News and take a shot.

00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:52.890
MATT: All right, so. Rip out Bad News, uses one of
your attacks, second attack prepares it. You're

00:13:52.890 --> 00:13:54.482
ready to fire, go ahead and shoot.

00:13:54.482 --> 00:13:59.405
TALIESIN: All right. They're pretty big, so I'm
going to take the negative five to my attack bonus

00:13:59.405 --> 00:14:06.914
and see what that does. That's a 21.

00:14:06.914 --> 00:14:08.629
MATT: 21 will hit.

00:14:08.629 --> 00:14:22.114
TALIESIN: That's a good shot. Oh yeah! That's 17,
27, plus-- 33 points of damage.

00:14:22.114 --> 00:14:31.228
MATT: 33 points of damage? Nice. So you hear this
loud, ringing explosion that echoes through this

00:14:31.228 --> 00:14:35.206
small valley at the base of the mountain, and from
out the corner of your eye, it's the first time

00:14:35.206 --> 00:14:40.993
you've seen this weapon do its wonders. You see a
flash of light, a plume of smoke goes up and you see

00:14:40.993 --> 00:14:48.476
this impossibly fast blast of some projectile go
slamming into the shoulder of the giant over here

00:14:48.476 --> 00:14:52.150
that's currently reaching for a rock. It pushes
him back against the wall, which prevents him from

00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:55.900
falling over and he catches himself. Looks back,
and you can see there's a small crater in the

00:14:55.900 --> 00:14:59.060
armor where a little bit of blood begins to pour
out, and a little bit of smoke seems to be pouring

00:14:59.060 --> 00:15:05.727
out of the impact. (snarls and yells) Gives out a
really angry yell. You can see like spittle that

00:15:05.727 --> 00:15:10.852
begins to shake loose and spray from his mouth out
of frustration. That the end of your turn?

00:15:10.852 --> 00:15:15.515
TALIESIN: That is the end of my turn. Yeah. I am
now going, maybe I shouldn't have done that.

00:15:15.515 --> 00:15:17.603
(laughter)

00:15:17.603 --> 00:15:19.449
FELICIA: It was very impressive. It was very
impressive.

00:15:19.449 --> 00:15:20.870
MATT: All right, Grog's up first.

00:15:20.870 --> 00:15:22.290
LAURA: (Grog voice) Grog--

00:15:22.290 --> 00:15:23.288
SAM: (Grog voice) Would like--

00:15:23.288 --> 00:15:37.222
LAURA: (Grog voice) No, Grog doesn't want to Rage!
Grog shouts out in Giant, wait! My giant masters

00:15:37.222 --> 00:15:44.514
were killed by a white dragon, which we think is
here. Will you help us fight him?

00:15:44.514 --> 00:15:50.788
MATT: Okay. So as Grog stands there, shouting this
out to both sides to the two giants, I want to

00:15:50.788 --> 00:15:54.256
have Grog go ahead and roll a persuasion check.

00:15:54.256 --> 00:15:57.196
LAURA: Okay. I am going to use Grog's dice.

00:15:57.196 --> 00:15:59.488
MATT: Yes. Let's do this proper. This is
customary.

00:15:59.488 --> 00:16:03.931
LAURA: It is proper. Wait. Okay. That's not his,
that is mine.

00:16:03.931 --> 00:16:06.187
TALIESIN: (Grog voice) I would like to negotiate.

00:16:06.187 --> 00:16:10.186
LAURA: Okay. Well that is good. He is really happy
that I am playing him,

00:16:10.352 --> 00:16:13.620
because I rolled a one for Grog.

00:16:13.620 --> 00:16:15.783
SAM: It might work.

00:16:15.783 --> 00:16:18.874
(laughter)

00:16:18.874 --> 00:16:25.267
LAURA: I think I should not-- okay. Wait!

00:16:25.267 --> 00:16:27.470
MARY: Doesn't Grog get two actions or no?

00:16:27.470 --> 00:16:29.587
LAURA: That's his action.

00:16:29.587 --> 00:16:32.224
MATT: He is not putting up any aggressive action.

00:16:32.224 --> 00:16:40.567
LAURA: Does he get advantage, however, because he
is speaking Giant and he's in the cold?

00:16:40.567 --> 00:16:42.745
MATT: No.

00:16:42.745 --> 00:16:44.278
(laughter)

00:16:44.278 --> 00:16:49.004
MATT: Because you have an entire band of seemingly
advancing and armed individuals that are currently

00:16:49.004 --> 00:16:53.638
stalking towards what appears to be the home of
these individuals. So unfortunately no. They seem

00:16:53.826 --> 00:16:58.869
unfazed, and the one at the back seems almost
partially amused at this plea and you can see as

00:16:58.869 --> 00:17:05.379
he takes his axe and puts it up against his
shoulder and runs it across the leather in a very

00:17:05.379 --> 00:17:08.483
aggressive, intimidating fashion as he stalks
forward out of the forest.

00:17:08.483 --> 00:17:11.621
LAURA: (Grog voice) Can Grog move at all?

00:17:11.621 --> 00:17:13.660
MATT: Yeah, would you like Grog to move? It would
be easier.

00:17:13.660 --> 00:17:14.312
LAURA: (Grog voice) Where is he?

00:17:14.312 --> 00:17:17.192
MATT: He is right here. He is hard to miss. Where
would you like Grog to move?

00:17:17.192 --> 00:17:18.854
There is a giant rock there.

00:17:18.854 --> 00:17:21.019
LAURA: He is going to stay there.

00:17:21.019 --> 00:17:26.366
MATT: Okay. Grog is going to stay up against the
rock. His axe across the front. Right, that ends

00:17:26.366 --> 00:17:28.217
Grog's turn. Vex, you're up.

00:17:28.217 --> 00:17:31.512
(laughter)

00:17:31.512 --> 00:17:36.063
LAURA: A moment of silence for that horrible thing
I just witnessed.

00:17:36.063 --> 00:17:42.605
MATT: You are over here. You just got up off the
ground after being slammed with a boulder, and you

00:17:42.605 --> 00:17:43.784
have Trinket there.

00:17:43.784 --> 00:17:48.188
LAURA: I am very hurt. Can I get up? Am I prone?

00:17:48.188 --> 00:17:52.652
MATT: In the process you've gotten to your feet as
they lurched forward and began shouting at each

00:17:52.652 --> 00:17:54.774
other about the intruders. So you are on your
feet.

00:17:54.774 --> 00:18:01.194
LAURA: Okay. I am going to cast Hunter's Mark.

00:18:01.194 --> 00:18:03.256
MATT: Hunter's Mark. On?

00:18:03.256 --> 00:18:15.878
LAURA: On the one that took a little damage
already. And then I am going to shoot him. All

00:18:15.878 --> 00:18:21.601
these are for like really large groups of people.
I am going to shoot him three times. Can I shoot

00:18:21.601 --> 00:18:22.769
him three times?

00:18:22.769 --> 00:18:23.828
MATT: You have two attacks.

00:18:23.828 --> 00:18:34.005
LAURA: I'm going to shoot him two times. This was
good times. This was fun, you guys. 14 for that.

00:18:34.005 --> 00:18:41.690
That probably doesn't hit. 14 also doesn't hit the
second time. Oh my god! What is happening?!

00:18:41.690 --> 00:18:43.847
(laughter)

00:18:43.847 --> 00:18:45.148
SAM: She just disappeared!

00:18:45.148 --> 00:18:47.441
MARY: Vex! Vex, stay with us! Vex!

00:18:47.441 --> 00:18:51.924
MATT: So as you get to your feet, you look over
your shoulder, you point your finger out and as

00:18:51.924 --> 00:18:57.431
you squint down, you use your ranger focus to make
sure this guy is your quarry, and you take a quick

00:18:57.431 --> 00:19:01.706
scope of his body parts. You're like, those are
the areas that will make him weakest. As you go to

00:19:01.706 --> 00:19:04.968
pull your arrow, you can feel a kink in your
shoulder. The impact of the rock seems to have

00:19:04.968 --> 00:19:09.957
affected you. You release the first arrow and it's
just slightly off mark. The second one you pull

00:19:09.957 --> 00:19:14.101
back and as you release it, it actually splinters
off his shield as he knocks it out of the air.

00:19:14.101 --> 00:19:20.692
LAURA: I am going to run over to cover. What is
that other side?

00:19:20.692 --> 00:19:25.064
MATT: That is one of the mountain
outcroppings.

00:19:25.064 --> 00:19:28.583
LAURA: Yeah, I am going to hide in that little
thing and go, Trinket hide with me.

00:19:28.583 --> 00:19:34.554
MATT: Okay, Trinket moves up. (bear moan) All
right, and that's your turn.

00:19:34.554 --> 00:19:35.890
LAURA: That's all of it.

00:19:35.890 --> 00:19:37.968
MATT: (laughs) All right, Lyra, you're up.

00:19:37.968 --> 00:19:42.636
FELICIA: Okay, I am freaked out right now. These
are very large individuals. I have only read about

00:19:42.636 --> 00:19:49.958
them, and they smell slightly like feet. So I am
going to-- that is a stench. That is like an

00:19:49.958 --> 00:19:56.061
athlete's foot commercial waiting to happen. So I
am going to take 10d6 and do Disintegrate.

00:19:56.061 --> 00:19:58.202
MATT: Go for it.

00:19:58.202 --> 00:20:08.773
FELICIA: I mean, it seems excessive, but they're
very large men! One, two, three, four, five-- That

00:20:08.773 --> 00:20:13.425
one, he looks like a bull. In the nether-regions.

00:20:13.425 --> 00:20:15.331
MATT: So which one, this one or this one?

00:20:15.331 --> 00:20:17.324
FELICIA: I don't think I can reach that guy.

00:20:17.324 --> 00:20:18.698
MATT: What's the distance on it?

00:20:18.698 --> 00:20:19.874
FELICIA: Oh boy.

00:20:19.874 --> 00:20:22.178
MATT: At your spell sheet.

00:20:22.178 --> 00:20:30.940
FELICIA: I should've written that down.
Disintegrate. Oh, there it is! 60 feet.

00:20:30.940 --> 00:20:33.358
MATT: 60 feet? Yeah, they're both within range.

00:20:33.358 --> 00:20:38.935
FELICIA: Oh gosh, well I should probably hit the
wounded one. That always makes RPG sense, right?

00:20:38.935 --> 00:20:43.532
MATT: So for that one, do you have to make an
actual spell attack roll?

00:20:43.532 --> 00:20:46.590
FELICIA: No, I don't. I think it's force damage.

00:20:46.590 --> 00:20:50.996
MATT: That's right. You just point at it and he
has to roll a saving throw.

00:20:50.996 --> 00:20:56.309
FELICIA: Oh yay! Look at that! Six! Six! Six!

00:20:56.309 --> 00:20:57.696
SAM: Well, don't say that.

00:20:57.696 --> 00:20:59.464
(laughter)

00:20:59.464 --> 00:21:03.522
MATT: All this time trying to fight the stigma of
DND, and there we go.

00:21:03.522 --> 00:21:05.565
MARY: Talking to my people here!

00:21:05.565 --> 00:21:21.064
FELICIA: All right. That's 20 plus-- now you're
all staring at me! 30, 40 points of damage!

00:21:21.064 --> 00:21:22.496
SAM: Whoa!

00:21:22.496 --> 00:21:26.856
MATT: That's a total of 40? Plus 40?

00:21:26.856 --> 00:21:28.282
FELICIA: 40 plus 40.

00:21:28.282 --> 00:21:31.837
MATT: Yeah, Disintegrate. And he failed his saving
throw.

00:21:31.837 --> 00:21:34.151
TALIESIN: Yeah!

00:21:34.151 --> 00:21:38.294
FELICIA: In your anus! That's what she yells,
she's like, in your anus!

00:21:38.294 --> 00:21:42.623
MATT: So as she shouts, she points her finger out,
there's a little poof of arcane energy on her

00:21:42.623 --> 00:21:48.603
finger, and a tiny, sickly green ray of energy
just streaks forth from her finger. The giant

00:21:48.603 --> 00:21:53.291
looks at it awkwardly, and in the split second it
hits him in the front of his chest and suddenly

00:21:53.291 --> 00:21:56.669
the armor in front of him turns to dust and you
can see his flesh beginning to just disappear in

00:21:56.669 --> 00:22:01.327
front of him (gasps) and suddenly tries to gasp
for air, as you see part of its jaw beginning to

00:22:01.327 --> 00:22:07.999
just turn to sand, and it's actually struggling in
a series of pain, and it's still standing, but you

00:22:07.999 --> 00:22:14.167
can see a large part of its body now is just
missing. It looks like it got-- it's almost like a

00:22:14.167 --> 00:22:20.492
portion of it rotted right before you, but there's
no actual necrosis. It's just gone. Flesh is

00:22:20.492 --> 00:22:27.143
missing from a large part of its body. It looks
like it's doing really poorly. It lurches forward,

00:22:27.143 --> 00:22:33.055
and one of its arms is not working as well and it
looks at you with a look of confusion, frustration

00:22:33.055 --> 00:22:36.593
and "how could you?." It's incredulous in its
torturous pain.

00:22:36.593 --> 00:22:43.111
FELICIA: And I go, (gibberish) in Giant and it's
the only thing I know in Giant, and I think it

00:22:43.111 --> 00:22:48.321
says, you are my foe, and I actually say, my cat
is your friend.

00:22:48.321 --> 00:22:56.203
MATT: Its head turns even further to the side as
the tongue lolls out of where the cheek once was.

00:22:56.203 --> 00:22:57.927
FELICIA: Take that!

00:22:57.927 --> 00:23:02.808
MATT: (chuckles) Its angry white eyes glaring
aggressively at you. Do you wish to move, or would

00:23:02.808 --> 00:23:04.188
you like to stay where you are?

00:23:04.188 --> 00:23:06.834
FELICIA: Oh, I think I'm going to duck behind that
little outcropping I have.

00:23:06.834 --> 00:23:07.796
MATT: Over here?

00:23:07.796 --> 00:23:13.214
FELICIA: Yeah, no, behind that little rock-- oh,
where am I? Oh, I'm over there. Yeah, I'm going to

00:23:13.214 --> 00:23:20.107
get-- oh boy. Just stand there, I'm just too
flushed right now. I can't go anywhere. This is

00:23:20.107 --> 00:23:21.441
too situational for me

00:23:21.441 --> 00:23:31.196
MATT: All right. Well, (chuckles) this very
unhappy giant is going to reach over with his one

00:23:31.196 --> 00:23:35.810
good arm, the other one's clutching the axe, it
reaches over and grabs another rock off the ground

00:23:35.810 --> 00:23:38.842
that it can find nearby and (whoosh) flings it at
you.

00:23:38.842 --> 00:23:40.598
FELICIA: I should have moved!

00:23:40.598 --> 00:23:42.555
(laughter)

00:23:42.555 --> 00:23:45.413
MATT: That is a 16. What's your armor class?

00:23:45.413 --> 00:23:46.935
FELICIA: 13.

00:23:46.935 --> 00:23:51.079
MATT: Yeah. You, unable to really move out of the
way, you look over and just watch it come toward

00:23:51.079 --> 00:23:55.817
you as it slowly spins in the air. Time seems to
slow as you make no intent to shift out of the

00:23:55.817 --> 00:24:01.601
way. (whack) It slams into you, physical pain not
hitting in as the immediate look of-- the sight of

00:24:01.601 --> 00:24:05.672
white, your vision is knocked to nothingness
briefly. You end up taking--

00:24:05.672 --> 00:24:09.087
MARY: No, Lyra, no.

00:24:09.087 --> 00:24:14.543
MATT: Okay, you take 32 points of bludgeoning
damage.

00:24:14.543 --> 00:24:20.488
FELICIA: Whoa! That is a very intense amount of
damage for a tiny woman. Okay.

00:24:20.488 --> 00:24:24.525
LAURA: You should avoid those boulders in the
future.

00:24:24.525 --> 00:24:30.889
MATT: And as soon as you recover from it, your
vision clarifies and you're able to see everything

00:24:30.889 --> 00:24:36.291
before you, and you see that same giant is
stalking up, right into your face, with its axe in

00:24:36.291 --> 00:24:39.792
its bad hand. It switches it into its good hand
and rears it up preparing itself for another

00:24:39.792 --> 00:24:50.947
round. That ends that giant's turn. It's going to
go five, six and move in between the two of you.

00:24:50.947 --> 00:24:56.648
You guys, Zahra and Scanlan, as you see this
happening you hear the (heavy steps) heavy

00:24:56.648 --> 00:24:59.357
footfalls behind you, and you look over your
shoulder as the second giant comes up with the

00:24:59.357 --> 00:25:05.079
shield in one arm. Axe is going to go ahead and
giant swing towards the two of you. That is going

00:25:05.079 --> 00:25:07.494
to be a 19 to hit on you, Scanlan.

00:25:07.494 --> 00:25:08.934
SAM: Oh yeah.

00:25:08.934 --> 00:25:14.157
MATT: And Zahra, that is going to be a-- that's a
25. All right.

00:25:14.157 --> 00:25:17.626
(laughter)

00:25:17.626 --> 00:25:32.581
MATT: 27 points of slashing damage to you,
Scanlan. Ooh. All right. And that is 31 points of

00:25:32.581 --> 00:25:37.047
slashing damage to you, Zahra. As it just (whack),
cleaves through the both of you. You are almost

00:25:37.047 --> 00:25:40.145
knocked off your feet from the sheer blow. Most of
the armor takes the damage but you can feel a

00:25:40.145 --> 00:25:44.396
heavy bruise, and underneath your armor you can feel a
little bit of the blood beginning to soak through

00:25:44.396 --> 00:25:49.891
from the severe impact. Part of the armor plating
might have cut into part of your torso (grunts)

00:25:49.891 --> 00:25:54.009
but you right yourself there. That ends their
turn. That brings us to Scanlan.

00:25:54.009 --> 00:26:02.454
SAM: Okay. Hey, question. If I hold a turn, do I
hold the whole turn? Can I hold my action but do

00:26:02.454 --> 00:26:04.314
the bonus action? How does it work?

00:26:04.314 --> 00:26:07.025
MATT: You got to take all your turn at once. You
can hold your initiative. Meaning

00:26:07.025 --> 00:26:10.749
you can wait to activate your
turn later in the tier, but you can't piecemeal

00:26:10.749 --> 00:26:11.837
your actions.

00:26:11.837 --> 00:26:17.579
SAM: Okay, then I am going to just move. I am
going to act. I am going to do things. So I turn

00:26:17.579 --> 00:26:24.675
to the guy who just hit me, and I am going to cast
Dominate Person on him. I will sing some sort of

00:26:24.675 --> 00:26:26.597
song to dominate him with.

00:26:26.597 --> 00:26:31.004
MATT: I will say, Dominate Person is effective
against humanoids.

00:26:31.004 --> 00:26:32.550
SAM: (gasps) Really?!

00:26:32.550 --> 00:26:34.608
MATT: Dominate Monster would be--

00:26:34.608 --> 00:26:36.034
SAM: They're not humanoid?

00:26:36.034 --> 00:26:39.885
MATT: They are not. They are considered giants.
They are a different species.

00:26:39.885 --> 00:26:40.987
You would know that.

00:26:40.987 --> 00:26:43.335
SAM: I would know that. Well, then, I guess I
won't do that.

00:26:43.335 --> 00:26:46.916
MATT: You turn, and your instinct is there, and
you're like, these are a little out of your reach

00:26:46.916 --> 00:26:48.495
as far as that spell is concerned.

00:26:48.495 --> 00:26:49.675
SAM: Okay.

00:26:49.675 --> 00:26:54.317
(laughter)

00:26:54.317 --> 00:26:56.184
MARY: It is a very short show tonight.

00:26:56.184 --> 00:26:58.456
SAM: Yeah. Okay, well, then we just die.

00:26:58.456 --> 00:27:00.282
(laughter)

00:27:00.282 --> 00:27:01.860
MATT: You've got options!

00:27:01.860 --> 00:27:13.470
SAM: Yeah, no, I have options. I'll be fine.
Should I go for the guy who-- I'll do (blows

00:27:13.470 --> 00:27:18.066
raspberry). I'll cast Lightning Bolt on him. That's
always a good go-to.

00:27:18.066 --> 00:27:22.723
MATT: So as you fumble with the idea of what spell
would work, you release a bolt of lightning up

00:27:22.723 --> 00:27:28.066
towards it. It streaks into the front of its chest
and shoulder area. You can see its muscles tense

00:27:28.066 --> 00:27:32.890
and shake from the sheer amount of electricity
that courses into it. It does not make that saving

00:27:32.890 --> 00:27:35.887
throw, not with a five. So go ahead and roll your
damage.

00:27:35.887 --> 00:27:36.945
SAM: Is it six or eight?

00:27:36.945 --> 00:27:38.156
MATT: It's 8d6.

00:27:38.156 --> 00:27:49.076
SAM: Thank you! Okay. Six, six, four. What is
that?

00:27:49.076 --> 00:27:50.100
FELICIA: Six.

00:27:50.100 --> 00:27:55.824
SAM: Oh, really? Oh, that's awesome! Now I lost
track. 32.

00:27:55.824 --> 00:28:02.715
MATT: 32 points of damage. Nice! So as you release
the torrent of electrical energy, it courses

00:28:02.715 --> 00:28:06.736
through the body and ends up streaking off into
the snowy, blizzardy sky behind the giant from the

00:28:06.736 --> 00:28:12.253
upward angle. It (grunts) shakes from the impact,
and then rights itself and looks down at you with

00:28:12.253 --> 00:28:18.462
a really angry face. You can see as it opens its
mouth, this light blue and dark teeth on the

00:28:18.462 --> 00:28:24.983
bottom of its beard-covered jaw. Mist and steam
tend to pour out of its mouth. But not like heated

00:28:24.983 --> 00:28:29.592
steam, this is like a cold air itself that it
seems to emanate from it. Its pale whitish-blue

00:28:29.592 --> 00:28:33.559
hair, slightly framing its form. Up close, at its
sheer size, this is a very intimidating creature,

00:28:33.559 --> 00:28:38.813
as it just stares down looming over you, now with
smoke pouring off its shoulder where you impacted

00:28:38.813 --> 00:28:41.637
it with the Lightning Bolt. Do you want to do
any--

00:28:41.637 --> 00:28:47.785
SAM: I would like to inspire our new fellow,
Zahra, with a quick little ditty. (singing) Ooh,

00:28:47.785 --> 00:28:54.672
you so scary, ooh, you so scary, ooh, you so
scary. You fighty long time.

00:28:54.672 --> 00:28:57.316
(laughter)

00:28:57.316 --> 00:29:02.486
MATT: All right. So you go ahead and take a d10
inspiration dice. Which means, whenever you have

00:29:02.486 --> 00:29:08.018
to roll an attack roll or saving throw, you can
add a d10 to the result you get if you don't think

00:29:08.018 --> 00:29:09.151
it's going to make it.

00:29:09.151 --> 00:29:11.716
You don't roll it now, but you just have it
on reserve whenever you want to use it.

00:29:12.009 --> 00:29:13.135
MARY: Love it.

00:29:13.135 --> 00:29:15.593
SAM: And if I move away from him he'll hit me?

00:29:15.593 --> 00:29:17.177
MATT: He'll get an attack of opportunity, yes.

00:29:17.177 --> 00:29:20.105
SAM: Can I snuggle between his legs and maybe
he'll forget I'm there?

00:29:20.105 --> 00:29:22.060
FELICIA: He's hung like a horse.

00:29:22.060 --> 00:29:23.810
TALIESIN: You're going to hit yourself in the
head

00:29:23.810 --> 00:29:27.143
MARY: Swing on it, man. Swing on it.

00:29:27.143 --> 00:29:29.469
(laughter)

00:29:29.469 --> 00:29:31.364
MARY: Yes! Yes, Scanlan!

00:29:31.364 --> 00:29:35.667
MATT: Do you want to try and do that?

00:29:35.667 --> 00:29:40.900
SAM: It might anger him? Or it might entice him.

00:29:40.900 --> 00:29:43.026
(laughter)

00:29:43.026 --> 00:29:44.206
SAM: I'll just stay put.

00:29:44.206 --> 00:29:46.776
MATT: All right. Zahra, you're up.

00:29:46.814 --> 00:29:53.576
MARY: All right, I have a question. Do they
understand English?

00:29:53.576 --> 00:29:55.611
MATT: You are not aware, actually.

00:29:55.611 --> 00:29:58.478
LAURA: But he said intruder when we came in.

00:29:58.478 --> 00:30:03.651
MATT: You heard him say it in Giant. It
was understood by Grog that it was intruder.

00:30:03.651 --> 00:30:06.628
MARY: All right. They're both within about 30 feet
of me, yes?

00:30:06.628 --> 00:30:10.282
MATT: Yes. They're both within 30 feet of you

00:30:10.282 --> 00:30:22.598
MARY: All right! I'm going to use one of my skills
that I have which it doesn't expel a spell slot

00:30:22.598 --> 00:30:29.407
and use Awakened Mind and touch them both with
telekinesis, and in doing so I shall cast Mass

00:30:29.407 --> 00:30:36.900
Suggestion, and I shall say to them, you will take
us to your enemy, the white dragon, and there we

00:30:36.900 --> 00:30:43.834
shall slay it together. Then you shall return us
here safely, where we shall part as friends bonded

00:30:43.834 --> 00:30:47.382
forever in the slaying of a common enemy.

00:30:47.382 --> 00:30:58.231
MATT: All right. As you're looking out at the two
of them, you release this energy, speaking through

00:30:58.231 --> 00:31:02.355
your mind, reaching out to theirs. What is the DC of
your spell? It should be at the top of your spell

00:31:02.355 --> 00:31:04.021
list, the difficulty class.

00:31:04.021 --> 00:31:06.611
SAM: Spell save DC. Top right.

00:31:06.611 --> 00:31:10.379
LAURA: Spell save DC is a 17.

00:31:10.379 --> 00:31:19.472
MATT: 17, all right. So both of them seem to--

00:31:19.472 --> 00:31:22.707
LAURA: Can you add your inspiration? Add your
inspiration!

00:31:22.707 --> 00:31:26.670
MATT: Inspiration has to be added to a roll.

00:31:26.670 --> 00:31:28.992
MARY: My charisma is added to any spell that I
cast.

00:31:28.992 --> 00:31:37.297
MATT: Well, that's included with the DC there. So
both of them reach up and grab their faces, one

00:31:37.297 --> 00:31:41.941
with its messed up, partially disintegrated hand
and falls back on its back foot and both of them

00:31:41.941 --> 00:31:49.836
look at the group in confusion. There definitely
seems to be some sort of interference with their

00:31:49.836 --> 00:31:54.324
current actions based on this spell; there is a
conflict within them. That's as much as I can tell

00:31:54.324 --> 00:32:04.156
you right now at the moment. That's your action.
Do you want to do anything else? You can still

00:32:04.156 --> 00:32:06.114
move. You still have a bonus action, if you want

00:32:06.114 --> 00:32:08.003
MARY: What do you mean bonus action?

00:32:08.003 --> 00:32:12.754
MATT: Your Hex is a bonus action, but that is a
spell, as well.

00:32:12.754 --> 00:32:18.179
MARY: If I move away from them though...

00:32:18.179 --> 00:32:19.591
LAURA: He can hit you.

00:32:19.591 --> 00:32:23.552
TALIESIN: If he's going to hit you. He might not.

00:32:23.552 --> 00:32:27.261
LAURA: That's true! Your spell might have worked.

00:32:27.261 --> 00:32:32.852
MARY: I shall go and protect Scanlan, underneath
the legs of that giant.

00:32:32.852 --> 00:32:35.487
MATT: So you move in to help defend Scanlan.

00:32:35.487 --> 00:32:42.110
MARY: He's so tiny, I love little guys. I always
have.

00:32:42.110 --> 00:32:44.829
SAM: She's a mother figure.

00:32:44.829 --> 00:32:53.742
MATT: All right, so both of them seem to be
looking around themselves, slightly confused and

00:32:53.742 --> 00:32:58.649
taking in some sort of strange circumstance.
Percy, you're up.

00:32:58.649 --> 00:33:02.224
TALIESIN: I'm going to hold my turn.

00:33:02.224 --> 00:33:07.468
MATT: Okay, Percy's holding initiative. Grog.

00:33:07.468 --> 00:33:20.685
LAURA: Should I say, in Giant, (in Grog voice)
What say you? Let's fight this bastard. Together.

00:33:20.685 --> 00:33:30.520
MATT: All right, they look at Grog, confused. Look
at each other again. That's Grog's turn, Vex?

00:33:30.520 --> 00:33:37.947
LAURA: Seriously? While everybody's having a
conversation, I would like to take

00:33:37.947 --> 00:33:39.335
a healing potion.

00:33:39.335 --> 00:33:41.566
MATT: All right. Go ahead and take one of those

00:33:41.566 --> 00:33:47.536
LAURA: Okay. How much do I take for a superior?

00:33:47.536 --> 00:33:55.821
MATT: Superior? Superior is 8d4 plus eight. It's
quite a bit.

00:33:55.821 --> 00:34:01.263
LAURA: It is, so just regular healing potion for
now. Which is what, 2d8?

00:34:01.263 --> 00:34:03.941
MATT: A regular is 2d4 plus two.

00:34:03.941 --> 00:34:12.111
LAURA: Yay! That's good.

00:34:12.111 --> 00:34:13.785
MATT: Lyra.

00:34:13.785 --> 00:34:24.934
FELICIA: I'm confused. But I do not feel good; I
might throw up. So I'm going to hold my turn to

00:34:24.934 --> 00:34:26.174
see what happens.

00:34:26.174 --> 00:34:27.788
MATT: Go ahead and make a constitution saving
throw.

00:34:27.788 --> 00:34:29.221
FELICIA: Oh, good.

00:34:29.221 --> 00:34:30.697
SAM: Oh, for the barf.

00:34:30.697 --> 00:34:36.536
FELICIA: Oh, it's a five! Constitution five. It's
a ten.

00:34:36.536 --> 00:34:42.523
MATT: You covertly do your best to not reveal to
the entire group that you make a little

00:34:42.523 --> 00:34:44.352
greenish-brown snow.

00:34:44.352 --> 00:34:47.005
(laughter)

00:34:47.005 --> 00:34:55.349
MATT: It is the most adorable barfing sound you
guys have ever heard, though. The combination of

00:34:55.349 --> 00:35:01.994
the stress and the smell, it's been a harrowing
experience for Lyra in these past few minutes. At

00:35:01.994 --> 00:35:08.081
this point in time, as it comes to the giants'
turn. The one who is messed up looks over to the

00:35:08.081 --> 00:35:16.998
other and (sighs) puts the axe into his belt loop,
and the other also one puts its axe in the belt

00:35:16.998 --> 00:35:28.974
loop, and they glare at the rest of the group, and
say in Giant, (gibberish). And any of you speak

00:35:28.974 --> 00:35:30.131
Giant? Or just Grog.

00:35:30.131 --> 00:35:31.242
LAURA: Grog.

00:35:31.242 --> 00:35:35.989
MATT: Grog translates. Essentially, they say, "We
will take you but it is at your own folly."

00:35:35.989 --> 00:35:40.225
LAURA: (in Grog voice) They'll take us, but it is
at our own folly.

00:35:40.225 --> 00:35:47.574
SAM: Take us as in-- Grog, can you ask them, take
us as in lead us or on their back?

00:35:47.574 --> 00:35:58.902
LAURA: (strangled gibberish) Which translates to,
take us as in lead us or carry us on your back?

00:35:58.902 --> 00:36:07.565
MATT: They both chuckle to themselves, and they
start walking in towards the cavern.

00:36:07.565 --> 00:36:13.637
LAURA: Wait! Can we rest a little before we go
fight this thing so we can get spell slots back

00:36:13.637 --> 00:36:14.916
and heal?

00:36:14.916 --> 00:36:16.464
MATT: That's up to you guys.

00:36:16.464 --> 00:36:18.010
LAURA: Can we? Yes! Yes!

00:36:18.010 --> 00:36:20.114
FELICIA: Up to 24 hours. This one lasts the whole
day. Yeah, can we?

00:36:20.114 --> 00:36:22.013
MATT: It lasts for 24 hours.

00:36:22.013 --> 00:36:23.886
MARY: Mass Suggestion lasts for 24 hours.

00:36:23.886 --> 00:36:25.377
SAM: Oh, that is good information.

00:36:25.377 --> 00:36:34.500
MARY: Oh and very important: none of us can damage
these two giants. Anything else can, we're fine,

00:36:34.500 --> 00:36:38.378
but should any of us damage it, the spell is
poof.

00:36:38.378 --> 00:36:46.495
LAURA: Are they going to fight with us? Grog? Will
you ask them if they're going to fight with us?

00:36:46.495 --> 00:36:48.489
(gibberish)

00:36:48.489 --> 00:36:49.608
MATT: How does it go, again?

00:36:49.608 --> 00:36:51.072
LAURA: (repeats previous gibberish)

00:36:51.072 --> 00:36:55.749
MATT: Right. One of them looks over the shoulder as
it's walking into the cavern and puts its hand on

00:36:55.749 --> 00:37:00.491
the top and leans over and its voice, and I will
say from this point forth it is translated to make

00:37:00.491 --> 00:37:01.457
it easier.

00:37:01.457 --> 00:37:02.865
SAM: Just like in Hunt for Red October?

00:37:02.865 --> 00:37:12.353
MATT: Yeah basically. "We take you but that is as
much as you get. The rest is your own choice.

00:37:12.353 --> 00:37:18.037
"Perhaps the dragon will eat you. That'll keep it
satiated for a while."

00:37:18.037 --> 00:37:20.112
It steps inside the cavern.

00:37:20.112 --> 00:37:21.813
LAURA: (Grog voice) I think that's a no.

00:37:21.813 --> 00:37:25.853
FELICIA: Yeah. And I say (speaks gibberish). My
cat is your friend!

00:37:25.853 --> 00:37:27.857
TALIESIN: Bless you!

00:37:27.857 --> 00:37:34.948
MATT: (laughs) As you say that, one walks inside.
The one that you partially disintegrated earlier

00:37:34.948 --> 00:37:44.027
steps out and goes, (spitting noise) and spits a--
what in midair looks like liquid and then

00:37:44.027 --> 00:37:48.734
(shattering) shatters into almost like crystalline
ice as it hits the ground on a rock.

00:37:48.734 --> 00:37:52.236
FELICIA: It is just rude. He smells so much like
feet.

00:37:52.236 --> 00:37:56.212
SAM: We'll Mass Suggest that they take a bath
later.

00:37:56.212 --> 00:38:01.467
TALIESIN: Let's take a breather. For a moment,
collect ourselves.

00:38:01.467 --> 00:38:04.743
LAURA: I wish I wouldn't have wasted a healing
potion just then because we can take some--

00:38:04.743 --> 00:38:07.774
FELICIA: We can heal our 1d6 plus three.

00:38:07.774 --> 00:38:18.825
MATT: So as you guys step inside the cavern. You
guys are taking a short rest, currently?

00:38:18.825 --> 00:38:19.984
SAM: Short rest.

00:38:19.984 --> 00:38:25.203
MATT: All right, so the giants are just sitting
there waiting, arms crossed against the wall,

00:38:25.203 --> 00:38:29.050
talking quietly to each other as the rest of you
sit down and bandage your wounds. You tend to your

00:38:29.050 --> 00:38:34.560
adrenaline as it slowly wears off and suddenly the
pain starts to set in from some of the wounds

00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:37.879
you've taken. So you guys can use as many hit dice
as you want to heal yourselves.

00:38:37.879 --> 00:38:40.176
MARY: So what do I do?

00:38:40.176 --> 00:38:44.656
LAURA: You roll a d8. You can roll up to 11d8,
plus two for each time.

00:38:44.656 --> 00:38:47.989
SAM: Hey, DM.

00:38:47.989 --> 00:38:49.295
MATT: Yes?

00:38:49.295 --> 00:38:52.004
SAM: How many hit points do I have?

00:38:52.004 --> 00:38:55.516
MATT: You haven't taken damage at this point.

00:38:55.516 --> 00:38:58.340
SAM: Have they increased at all?

00:38:58.340 --> 00:39:01.273
MATT: That is true. You leveled up after the last
one. So with this short rest I will say go ahead

00:39:01.273 --> 00:39:04.571
and roll an additional-- for a bard I think it is
a d8, correct?

00:39:04.571 --> 00:39:05.765
SAM: I don't know.

00:39:05.765 --> 00:39:07.355
MATT: What's your hit dice number?

00:39:07.355 --> 00:39:08.590
SAM: d8.

00:39:08.590 --> 00:39:10.117
MATT: And what's your constitution?

00:39:10.117 --> 00:39:12.290
SAM: 15. Plus two.

00:39:12.290 --> 00:39:14.806
MATT: All right, so go ahead and roll a d8 plus
two to it

00:39:14.806 --> 00:39:16.528
SAM: Four.

00:39:16.528 --> 00:39:19.578
MATT: All right, so you add four hit points to
your total hit point maximum.

00:39:19.578 --> 00:39:21.389
Welcome to level 11, Scanlan.

00:39:21.389 --> 00:39:29.073
(cheering and singing Super Mario victory ditty)

00:39:29.073 --> 00:39:31.112
MATT: You also get access to your first 6th-level
spell.

00:39:31.112 --> 00:39:32.432
MARY: What!?

00:39:32.432 --> 00:39:35.458
LAURA: What? Get some stuff before we fight a
dragon, yo.

00:39:35.458 --> 00:39:37.445
SAM: I got it already. I am ready to rock.

00:39:37.445 --> 00:39:47.409
MATT: Good. Good choice. You take the next half an
hour or so to rest up. You still used your

00:39:47.409 --> 00:39:49.719
Disintegrate. You need to do a whole night's rest
to get that back.

00:39:49.719 --> 00:39:54.115
FELICIA: Oh! I don't get it? It's six spell
levels.

00:39:54.115 --> 00:39:56.303
MATT: It is six spell levels you can get back on a
short rest?

00:39:56.303 --> 00:40:00.113
FELICIA: Short rest. Recover six spell levels
because I have arcane recovery. So I can actually

00:40:00.113 --> 00:40:01.030
get that back

00:40:01.030 --> 00:40:04.287
MATT: (singing) Wizards are awesome!

00:40:04.287 --> 00:40:10.345
LAURA: (Grog voice) Grog would like to take his
Chain of Returning off of one of the axes he had

00:40:10.345 --> 00:40:16.759
it on and put onto the Firebrand Warhammer that he
took off of that dwarf in Kraghammer.

00:40:16.759 --> 00:40:20.448
MATT: All righty, I like it.

00:40:20.448 --> 00:40:23.380
LAURA: The mean guy he took it off.

00:40:23.380 --> 00:40:28.674
MATT: Off of, that was King Murghol, I think,
wasn't it? The duergar king you fought in the

00:40:28.674 --> 00:40:31.031
Underdark.

00:40:31.031 --> 00:40:36.636
MARY: I have a question. So I rolled to get my
health back and I got more hit points than I had

00:40:36.636 --> 00:40:37.510
before--

00:40:37.510 --> 00:40:40.057
MATT: You can't go more than your maximum. You're
at full hit points now.

00:40:40.057 --> 00:40:47.188
TALIESIN: I want to borrow Grog for just a second
and ask these two if they've encountered the

00:40:47.188 --> 00:40:51.854
dragon before, and what its disposition is.
Anything we should know.

00:40:51.854 --> 00:40:59.712
MATT: I want you to go ahead, and I will say
through Grog-- this is going to be interesting.

00:40:59.712 --> 00:41:11.116
Since Grog is translating, I'm going to go ahead
and have you roll a persuasion check.

00:41:11.116 --> 00:41:13.307
FELICIA: Wrong dice! Why did you use that dice?

00:41:13.307 --> 00:41:15.135
TALIESIN: I was feeling weak. Ten.

00:41:15.135 --> 00:41:18.718
MATT: Ten. And I want you to roll a persuasion
check for Grog with disadvantage.

00:41:18.718 --> 00:41:27.155
LAURA: Great. Oh, that was a good roll, come on
also good roll.

00:41:27.155 --> 00:41:31.278
FELICIA: It wasn't a good roll. I see a face
there.

00:41:31.278 --> 00:41:33.787
TALIESIN: It was a one, wasn't it?

00:41:33.787 --> 00:41:36.478
LAURA: It was a one.

00:41:36.478 --> 00:41:39.722
MATT: All the crits were last week.

00:41:39.722 --> 00:41:43.089
TALIESIN: This is my fault. This is all my fault.

00:41:43.089 --> 00:41:48.042
FELICIA: You are a plague. Your good fortune is a
plague upon your friends.

00:41:48.042 --> 00:41:52.199
LAURA: Travis is going to be so pissed when he
gets here.

00:41:52.199 --> 00:41:53.562
MATT: I know.

00:41:53.562 --> 00:41:55.707
SAM: He'll be dead by the time he gets here

00:41:55.707 --> 00:41:59.535
LAURA: His flight landed. I got a text. His flight
has landed. He's on his way.

00:41:59.535 --> 00:42:07.254
MATT: Great, awesome. As Grog finishes translating
(gibberish) to the giants, the giants chuckle to

00:42:07.254 --> 00:42:11.782
themselves and the other one says down to him,
what he translates for you, the equivalent of,

00:42:11.782 --> 00:42:20.905
"There's no help here. They killed our people, but
we're alive because we serve it. We'll bring you,

00:42:20.905 --> 00:42:26.010
"like we promised, like we brought all the
others."

00:42:26.010 --> 00:42:29.154
LAURA: They serve the dragon?

00:42:29.154 --> 00:42:32.998
FELICIA: Can we look around? Are there any dragon
tips around?

00:42:32.998 --> 00:42:37.212
MATT: You took a rest inside the cavern as you
just entered the mountain and at this point as you

00:42:37.212 --> 00:42:40.050
guys step up the giants are leading you further
into the cavern.

00:42:40.050 --> 00:42:41.869
MARY: May I talk to him, as well?

00:42:41.869 --> 00:42:43.440
MATT: You know Giant?

00:42:43.440 --> 00:42:46.609
MARY: No, through Grog. I have telekinesis, so can
I speak to one of them?

00:42:46.609 --> 00:42:48.752
MATT: Well, telekinesis and telepathy are
different things.

00:42:48.752 --> 00:42:51.003
MARY: Oh, I mean, I have Awakened Mind.

00:42:51.003 --> 00:42:54.298
MATT: Oh right. So you can speak directly to their
minds

00:42:54.298 --> 00:43:02.876
MARY: Yes. Your people have been persecuted for so
long, and you have lost so many of the female

00:43:02.876 --> 00:43:10.396
version of you, and your children, and you serve
them now. Do you want to live as slaves?

00:43:10.396 --> 00:43:12.310
MATT: "We want to live."

00:43:12.310 --> 00:43:16.026
MARY: So to live as a slave is better than--

00:43:16.026 --> 00:43:18.426
MATT: "To not live at all?"

00:43:18.426 --> 00:43:26.023
MARY: We are offering you the opportunity to stop
your servitude. To end it forever.

00:43:26.023 --> 00:43:29.553
MATT: (grunts) They keep walking

00:43:29.553 --> 00:43:30.972
LAURA: What?

00:43:30.972 --> 00:43:42.281
MATT: We'll see how this plays out. This is a
process here. You guys heavily failed some early

00:43:42.281 --> 00:43:45.279
persuasion rolls here, they're in a very negative
position with you right now.

00:43:45.279 --> 00:43:48.186
LAURA: Sorry about that.

00:43:48.186 --> 00:43:50.903
FELICIA: Let's not bring it up again. I love your
hair.

00:43:50.903 --> 00:43:53.430
SAM: It's really cool.

00:43:53.430 --> 00:44:00.785
MATT: So about 200 feet further into this cavern,
the tunnel opens up into a gargantuan natural rock

00:44:00.785 --> 00:44:08.148
chamber, coated in ice crystals across the
entirety of the rounded crag in the ceiling. You

00:44:08.148 --> 00:44:12.815
can see now as the light you're bringing into-- by
the way, is anyone bringing a source of light

00:44:12.815 --> 00:44:14.203
other than the torchlight?

00:44:14.203 --> 00:44:15.808
LAURA: Yes, Grog lights his blazing axe.

00:44:15.931 --> 00:44:18.692
MARY: And I cast Light on my dark dragon staff.

00:44:18.692 --> 00:44:24.111
MATT: All right, so between the (whoosh) now the
fire that is now burning off of the warhammer and

00:44:24.111 --> 00:44:30.038
your Light spell, you can see as you enter
following these giants, there are definitely the

00:44:30.038 --> 00:44:35.397
remnants of a village here, a village that
was designed on the scale of these giants and

00:44:35.397 --> 00:44:41.357
while many of these structures still stand, it is
eerily quiet as you step inside. As you begin to

00:44:41.357 --> 00:44:44.748
step further into the center of this cavern, you
see many of these structures have been smashed and

00:44:44.748 --> 00:44:50.437
destroyed and there is a layer of ice and snow
that has been carried in from various blizzard

00:44:50.437 --> 00:44:55.909
winds or just the internal temperature in this
room. And the room is extremely cold. With the

00:44:55.909 --> 00:44:59.449
little bit of light you have, everyone's breath is
very clearly visible with each puff into the air

00:44:59.449 --> 00:45:03.781
around, and you swear that in a few pockets here it is
so cold that you can hear the moisture from your

00:45:03.781 --> 00:45:09.131
breath coalesce and then shatter on the ground.
You all bundle up even tighter

00:45:09.131 --> 00:45:10.434
with your various furs.

00:45:10.434 --> 00:45:12.151
LAURA: I snuggle very close to Trinket.

00:45:12.151 --> 00:45:16.333
MATT: Trinket snuggles very close to you because
Trinket, while made for this type of temperature,

00:45:16.333 --> 00:45:19.029
is still uncomfortably cold, even at this point.

00:45:19.029 --> 00:45:21.330
SAM: Did Lyra give me--

00:45:21.330 --> 00:45:26.124
FELICIA: I did! I gave you my stone. My
Transmutation Stone, which helps you resist cold.

00:45:26.124 --> 00:45:28.767
SAM: Wow, I feel so warm and cuddly.

00:45:28.767 --> 00:45:33.968
FELICIA: Well, don't brag about it. Oh my gosh, my
mom told me never bring-- well, she's dead, but

00:45:33.968 --> 00:45:39.711
before she died, she told me if you can't bring
one for everybody, don't bring any. So just be

00:45:39.711 --> 00:45:40.795
quiet about it.

00:45:40.795 --> 00:45:44.503
SAM: Okay. I'm sorry. I was just distracted
because we're in a dire situation and I miss the

00:45:44.503 --> 00:45:48.815
love of my life, Pike. I'm sure you can't identify
with that.

00:45:48.815 --> 00:45:53.651
FELICIA: Oh no! I was just thinking the other day,
just outside the cavern, if Aldor was here--

00:45:53.651 --> 00:45:54.641
SAM: Aldor?

00:45:54.641 --> 00:45:55.896
FELICIA: Yes! Did I tell you about him?

00:45:55.896 --> 00:45:57.022
SAM: A little.

00:45:57.022 --> 00:46:03.566
FELICIA: He smells like sandalwood and
dismissiveness, but that's okay.

00:46:03.566 --> 00:46:05.233
We'll get over that.

00:46:05.233 --> 00:46:10.394
SAM: Well, we have something in common then and
thank you for your stone of warmth

00:46:10.394 --> 00:46:11.614
or whatever it was.

00:46:11.614 --> 00:46:12.900
FELICIA: It's a cold resistance.

00:46:12.900 --> 00:46:16.377
SAM: I'll just call it a stone of warmth.

00:46:16.377 --> 00:46:19.526
MATT: There is no character class more dangerous
in DND than mother.

00:46:19.526 --> 00:46:22.087
(laughter)

00:46:22.087 --> 00:46:27.805
MATT: Do not have children if you are ever in a
fantasy genre or anything.

00:46:27.805 --> 00:46:29.865
You ain't getting past 30.

00:46:29.865 --> 00:46:33.956
MARY: May I again, sorry, use Awakened Mind to ask
the giant what happened here?

00:46:33.956 --> 00:46:41.046
MATT: As they begin walking through and looking
about, one of them starts giving you these images,

00:46:41.046 --> 00:46:48.743
and it's less of a language and it's more of a
series of memories. And you see visions of a time

00:46:48.743 --> 00:46:57.945
not long ago. Months, even years. This relatively
thriving village of frost giants that had

00:46:57.945 --> 00:47:02.780
essentially claimed this mountain as their own
for generations. Hunting in the nearby Vesper

00:47:02.780 --> 00:47:10.957
Timberland, occasionally harrowing the traveling
merchant band heading up the Glasswalk Path or

00:47:10.957 --> 00:47:17.431
various other entities that live in this forest.
They're not by any means a good people. They exist

00:47:17.431 --> 00:47:26.291
and they take what they want, but it appears that
not long ago this dragon decided that it wanted to

00:47:26.291 --> 00:47:31.732
live here instead. And you see visions of it
stalking through the tunnels, carving its way

00:47:31.732 --> 00:47:37.766
through the ice and ambushing this frost giant
village. You see visions of it tearing into

00:47:37.766 --> 00:47:44.637
families of them and freezing them on the spot,
which is interesting because you see, these giants

00:47:44.637 --> 00:47:50.642
seem pretty well-adapted to ice and cold
weather. It seems it is less of a freezing them

00:47:50.642 --> 00:47:53.614
physically and more of locking them into place.
And as you see these visions, you begin to step

00:47:53.614 --> 00:47:59.807
further into this village and you can see there
are spires, large spires of crystallized ice, and

00:47:59.807 --> 00:48:04.866
loosely within the shadows of the ice you can see
what looks like the suffocated forms of frost

00:48:04.866 --> 00:48:13.864
giants that are locked in that position under many
feet of ice. You see most of this village brought

00:48:13.864 --> 00:48:22.020
to its knees and destroyed, murdered, eaten, or
imprisoned and these two, essentially chosen to

00:48:22.020 --> 00:48:28.188
survive and given the order to bring what this
creature wants.

00:48:28.188 --> 00:48:30.398
MARY: There's only two of you left?

00:48:30.398 --> 00:48:40.416
MATT: You get this sense of sadness and fear, but
also a sense of a lack of any other option.

00:48:40.416 --> 00:48:43.074
MARY: Oh, how I wish we could release you from
these bonds.

00:48:43.074 --> 00:48:48.527
LAURA: Is there a way to, like, melt the spires?
(whispers) I interrupted you.

00:48:48.527 --> 00:48:50.545
MARY: To release them.

00:48:50.545 --> 00:48:54.738
FELICIA: They are dead in there though, right?

00:48:54.738 --> 00:48:59.020
MARY: No, I know but at least maybe they could--
Do you have some burial ritual or anything that

00:48:59.020 --> 00:49:04.349
you would like to or do these stand as a painful
remembrance for you?

00:49:04.349 --> 00:49:10.757
MATT: There is a moment where it seems almost like
it's going to answer, and then the mind closes off

00:49:10.757 --> 00:49:17.659
suddenly. There is a defensiveness and these
entities, you get the sense that even this

00:49:17.659 --> 00:49:23.712
tenuous relationship you have built with them is
based purely on arcane persuasion, and the more

00:49:23.712 --> 00:49:29.848
you pry, the more you begin to test the boundaries
of what you have done. Pick and choose your words

00:49:29.848 --> 00:49:31.174
very carefully.

00:49:31.174 --> 00:49:39.661
MARY: Zahra sheds a tear, which freezes instantly
on her face, and her internal flame melts it off.

00:49:39.661 --> 00:49:42.062
LAURA: That's pretty badass.

00:49:42.062 --> 00:49:50.730
MATT: As you continue to walk, you can see the center
of this village is completely in tatters. A lot of

00:49:50.730 --> 00:49:57.713
the wood and the dried brush and the furs and
thick leathers that these giants had gathered and

00:49:57.713 --> 00:50:03.229
constructed their civilization out of is all just
shattered and rended to the floor and then

00:50:03.229 --> 00:50:10.721
frozen over, left in this weird picturesque,
almost a tapestry. A frozen moment in time of

00:50:10.721 --> 00:50:19.373
utter desolation. Actually, I want you to all to
roll a perception check, if you could.

00:50:19.373 --> 00:50:26.323
TALIESIN: 17.

00:50:26.323 --> 00:50:27.386
FELICIA: 14.

00:50:27.386 --> 00:50:28.343
SAM: 20.

00:50:28.343 --> 00:50:30.352
LAURA: Oh! No we're not in-- 14.

00:50:30.352 --> 00:50:33.128
MARY: Uno.

00:50:33.128 --> 00:50:38.550
MATT: Wow, getting the ones out. So as you guys
are walking forward, Scanlan, you notice that

00:50:38.550 --> 00:50:46.071
there is, just outside the light perception
stepping forward, a lot of the rubble has been

00:50:46.071 --> 00:50:55.410
pushed and coalesced into a central monolith.
Almost like a 25, 30 foot sculpture of chaos. All

00:50:55.410 --> 00:51:01.892
of these things have been matted together with
what looks like mud and refuse, and as you guys

00:51:01.892 --> 00:51:08.130
begin to notice this, too, you catch the framing
of the light on it and it seems to be built into

00:51:08.130 --> 00:51:17.693
almost an altar or a large sculpture of worship of
a winged dragon creature that is currently in the

00:51:17.693 --> 00:51:24.961
process of swooping down. You get the sensation
that this was built as, essentially, a place of

00:51:24.961 --> 00:51:33.001
offering to this white dragon, and hopefully a
symbol to keep themselves alive and to prove their

00:51:33.001 --> 00:51:35.383
fealty to this entity.

00:51:35.383 --> 00:51:41.234
FELICIA: I have a spell called Legend Lore. Can I
cast that on white dragon?

00:51:41.234 --> 00:51:45.900
MATT: Let's see what Legend Lore does.

00:51:45.900 --> 00:51:50.222
FELICIA: The spell brings to your mind a brief
summary of the significant lore about the thing

00:51:50.222 --> 00:51:55.838
you named: current tales, forgotten stories,
secret lore that has never been widely known. If

00:51:55.838 --> 00:51:59.489
it is not of legendary importance, you gain no
information. Would I think that this is a

00:51:59.489 --> 00:52:01.117
legendary dragon?

00:52:01.117 --> 00:52:05.325
MATT: Okay. As you take a moment and everyone stops
to look around, you notice that Lyra is sitting there

00:52:05.325 --> 00:52:08.570
currently muttering to herself and putting her
fingers through the air, and you can see these

00:52:08.570 --> 00:52:14.029
small arcane sigils begin to flash in the air
where she places her hands, at which point her eyes

00:52:14.029 --> 00:52:22.656
glaze over with this shimmering gold energy and
she seems to go into a trance. Now, what you first

00:52:22.656 --> 00:52:29.848
are hit with is the image of darkness, black and
struggle, a struggle to push, a struggle to exist,

00:52:29.848 --> 00:52:36.240
a struggle to survive, and then suddenly light.
You see the cracking of something releasing, and

00:52:36.240 --> 00:52:42.275
from there pulling forth from this singular egg,
the only one left of its clutch, a white dragon

00:52:42.275 --> 00:52:48.900
wyrmling pulling itself out of the egg. This, you
immediately sense, is the dragon that now resides

00:52:48.900 --> 00:52:50.860
within this mountain.

00:52:50.860 --> 00:52:57.189
You begin to see flashes in time of it struggling
to survive in the frozen tundra to the north,

00:52:57.189 --> 00:53:02.973
desperately trying to escape poachers and
individuals trying to hunt it, whether to protect

00:53:02.973 --> 00:53:10.802
their own villages or to use its physical body
parts in some sort of sale. You get the sense that

00:53:10.802 --> 00:53:17.797
at one point it was already the target of some
contract that failed. For a brief second, you see

00:53:17.797 --> 00:53:25.345
a flash of a frozen cavern recently, and a few
individuals locked in an icy prison bitten down on

00:53:25.345 --> 00:53:31.242
and shattered before it cuts to black again. You
begin to see moments of this dragon growing, and

00:53:31.242 --> 00:53:38.403
with each stage in its physical transformation
towards becoming a full-fledged adult dragon there

00:53:38.403 --> 00:53:47.843
is just spite, there is anger, there is ego, there
is a severe sense of self-importance, a lust for

00:53:47.843 --> 00:53:55.807
others to bow before, serve, or feed it. And you
have heard and you have read many things about

00:53:55.807 --> 00:54:00.453
dragons and you have heard things of great
intelligence and articulate entities that even,

00:54:00.453 --> 00:54:09.717
good or evil themselves, have this extremely
intelligent presence. This dragon is far more

00:54:09.717 --> 00:54:14.558
feral and bestial than anything you've read about.
It has an intelligence, but it seems to not be

00:54:14.558 --> 00:54:19.910
concerned with the intricacies of conversation as
much as it is to bend everything to its will and

00:54:19.910 --> 00:54:24.590
to give (voices deepens) to me. (normally) And the
one thing that catches your mind before the spell

00:54:24.590 --> 00:54:30.530
ends is the name that it finally came upon itself,
the name that it heard whispered as one of its

00:54:30.530 --> 00:54:33.667
would-be hunters was suddenly--

00:54:33.667 --> 00:54:34.793
SAM: Jeff.

00:54:34.793 --> 00:54:36.215
(laughter)

00:54:36.215 --> 00:54:41.470
MATT: Jeff the dragon. The name Rimefang rings
through your mind.

00:54:41.470 --> 00:54:46.174
FELICIA: His name is Rimefang.

00:54:46.174 --> 00:54:55.347
MATT: The two frost giants stop their walking and
turn. "Rimefang." They nod and look up to the

00:54:55.347 --> 00:54:57.270
giant structure they constructed.

00:54:57.270 --> 00:55:01.696
FELICIA: Oh wow! Can I make a history to sww if I know
anyone in the guild who has been named Rimefang?

00:55:01.696 --> 00:55:05.422
MATT: Make a history check on this.

00:55:05.422 --> 00:55:06.852
FELICIA: It's a 21.

00:55:06.852 --> 00:55:13.663
MATT: Okay, Rimefang, you gather, is the name of
the dragon proper. And there's another drink for

00:55:13.663 --> 00:55:16.305
you guys out there. They made fun of me for using
the word proper.

00:55:16.305 --> 00:55:18.611
SAM: Drink!

00:55:18.611 --> 00:55:30.153
MATT: This dragon took the name Rimefang. Because
in a lot of dragons as they evolve and begin to

00:55:30.153 --> 00:55:37.162
really create a lair, they really make themselves
known publicly and really draw the fear out once

00:55:37.162 --> 00:55:40.186
they feel they're in a comfortable position. You
feel this dragon is just starting to get to that

00:55:40.186 --> 00:55:46.561
point where it's eager to drive fear into the
local populace. From your history check, you do

00:55:46.561 --> 00:55:52.288
know that there is, somewhere in the books you've
gone through, a similar contract, nothing Rimefang

00:55:52.288 --> 00:55:58.116
related, but there was a white dragon that was
supposedly hunted about eight, nine months back,

00:55:58.116 --> 00:56:05.074
and the team never returned. And you begin to
think, "Wait, so if a team of really practiced

00:56:05.074 --> 00:56:11.899
"people never returned from this contract, and we
were sent on this as an entry level..."

00:56:11.899 --> 00:56:19.551
FELICIA: Hey, guys? I have a suspicion that maybe
the guild didn't want us to succeed. And I don't

00:56:19.551 --> 00:56:25.081
want to panic anybody. I just don't think
Vanessa--

00:56:25.081 --> 00:56:28.134
MARY: Lyra, do you have any enemies in the guild?

00:56:28.134 --> 00:56:36.277
FELICIA: Well. Everyone seems to be very-- I make
a very good soup and I help people with their

00:56:36.277 --> 00:56:37.594
laundry sometimes and--

00:56:37.594 --> 00:56:39.004
LAURA: Oh, are you like an assistant?

00:56:39.004 --> 00:56:42.305
FELICIA: No, I'm a guild member, I just like to be
helpful. Like you guys.

00:56:42.305 --> 00:56:43.964
LAURA: I was just wondering.

00:56:43.964 --> 00:56:47.505
FELICIA: Well, they just don't send me anywhere.
It's a paperwork thing.

00:56:47.505 --> 00:56:55.264
MARY: If you don't mind my asking because I do
respect you so much, how did your captainship of

00:56:55.264 --> 00:56:58.417
our crew come about?

00:56:58.417 --> 00:57:02.331
FELICIA: Well, I got a missive, I got a scroll in
my room and the first assignment. I mean, it was

00:57:02.331 --> 00:57:06.123
very exciting to me and they haven't really paid
attention to me. Mertin is very nice to me but

00:57:06.123 --> 00:57:14.401
Vanessa-- she just has her days, and I've been
asking her for so long, and finally I got my

00:57:14.401 --> 00:57:20.253
assignment. I was hoping Aldor would be here, but
he isn't, and that's fine. It'll be the next one.

00:57:20.253 --> 00:57:25.458
But there may not be a next one, guys. That's what
I'm saying.

00:57:25.458 --> 00:57:30.525
MARY: Oh, were you Vanessa's assistant? I mean,
before you were a member?

00:57:30.525 --> 00:57:33.248
FELICIA: No. Aldor. I'm here with Aldor,
remember?

00:57:33.248 --> 00:57:37.917
SAM: If you think we've been sent on some sort of
suicide mission--

00:57:37.917 --> 00:57:39.557
FELICIA: Oh, that's good, the way you put it
there!

00:57:39.557 --> 00:57:47.503
SAM: Well, I'm a master of words. Should we
abandon all hope and just flee? Is that what

00:57:47.503 --> 00:57:52.231
you're suggesting as our leader? Or should we
carry it through and prove everyone wrong?

00:57:52.231 --> 00:57:57.639
FELICIA: If we abandon this quest, then we never--
I could get kicked out of the guild, for one.

00:57:57.639 --> 00:58:05.166
LAURA: What happens if the contract that we
magically signed doesn't ever come to fruition?

00:58:05.166 --> 00:58:11.259
FELICIA: It's not good.&nbsp;Let me think.

00:58:11.259 --> 00:58:15.684
SAM: You know what? Retrace your steps.

00:58:15.684 --> 00:58:23.099
MATT: There you go. In Memento fashion, all these
things flash through. If a contract is broken,

00:58:23.099 --> 00:58:28.377
one: if you're a member of the guild, you're
kicked out of the guild. Two: you guys are on

00:58:28.377 --> 00:58:35.255
this essentially as a trial basis to prevent
being arrested and put on trial for breaking

00:58:35.255 --> 00:58:39.508
the laws of the city of Vasselheim and essentially
hunting creatures that aren't sanctified. Or you

00:58:39.508 --> 00:58:42.948
yourself have not been sanctified to kill, which
goes against guild rules and the city itself.

00:58:42.948 --> 00:58:49.406
Which means if you were to not succeed at the
contract, you would probably be put on trial at the

00:58:49.406 --> 00:58:50.746
seat of judgment.

00:58:50.746 --> 00:58:53.188
LAURA: Percy is very good at lawyering.

00:58:53.188 --> 00:58:59.686
TALIESIN: I am. I lawyer quite well, but the hope
is that we wouldn't actually break the contract in

00:58:59.686 --> 00:59:02.528
the first place, because that's complicated.

00:59:02.528 --> 00:59:11.734
MARY: I wasn't part of this band of breaking the
law. I'm here to gain entry into this guild.

00:59:11.734 --> 00:59:14.034
FELICIA: Well, you certainly won't get into the
guild if you break the contract.

00:59:14.034 --> 00:59:21.014
MARY: No, I completely understand, but I won't be
brought to trial. Not that I'm all, "well it's all

00:59:21.014 --> 00:59:25.259
about me," but I'm serious. That's why I'm here!
My motivations are not to save my ass, my

00:59:25.259 --> 00:59:28.024
motivations are to get into this bloody guild!

00:59:28.024 --> 00:59:33.883
TALIESIN: We're not here based on other people's
expectations. We're here because we thought we

00:59:33.883 --> 00:59:37.156
could handle this and nothing has changed. This
changes nothing!

00:59:37.156 --> 00:59:39.530
LAURA: We are very capable fighters!

00:59:39.530 --> 00:59:45.879
MARY: I've seen this. You have proven yourselves
already. Those orcs didn't stand a bloody chance.

00:59:45.879 --> 00:59:49.382
TALIESIN: Thank you.

00:59:49.382 --> 00:59:51.842
FELICIA: So we go?

00:59:51.842 --> 00:59:57.635
SAM: We go. Well actually, Grog-- could someone
ask Ace and Gary if we're there or if we have

00:59:57.635 --> 00:59:58.983
further to travel?

00:59:58.983 --> 01:00:00.229
FELICIA: We'll just keep going.

01:00:00.229 --> 01:00:03.647
MATT: As Grog mentions this, you guys have moved
past most of the village, and you've gone towards

01:00:03.647 --> 01:00:10.970
the back of this large chamber, and you do see
what appears to be a tunnel that ascends upwards,

01:00:10.970 --> 01:00:19.134
deeper into the mountain proper. See, did it
again. It's made me all self-conscious. But the

01:00:19.134 --> 01:00:25.879
entrance is entirely frozen. There is a wall of
solid ice between yourselves and the continuation

01:00:25.879 --> 01:00:27.187
of this tunnel.

01:00:27.187 --> 01:00:28.658
LAURA: (Grog voice) How thick is it?

01:00:28.658 --> 01:00:30.863
MATT: It's hard to see how thick it is from this
side.

01:00:30.863 --> 01:00:34.150
LAURA: (Grog voice) Can Grog run at it and try to
bash it really fast?

01:00:34.150 --> 01:00:39.729
MATT: So as you guys step up, Grog runs ahead of
the rest of the giants and goes as hard as he can

01:00:39.729 --> 01:00:46.009
towards this. (laughs) So swinging with the axe
towards the ice. Go ahead and

01:00:46.009 --> 01:00:47.366
make an attack roll.

01:00:47.366 --> 01:00:49.899
LAURA: It's a hammer, which I feel would be better
against ice.

01:00:49.899 --> 01:00:54.160
MATT: This giant flaming warhammer from King
Murghol.

01:00:54.160 --> 01:00:56.006
LAURA: I feel like every dice is betraying me.

01:00:56.006 --> 01:00:57.496
TALIESIN: Would you like to use mine?

01:00:57.496 --> 01:00:59.328
LAURA: No, I'm going to curse yours.

01:00:59.328 --> 01:01:02.411
MATT: No, turn it around. Shake the Wil Wheaton
curse.

01:01:02.411 --> 01:01:07.191
LAURA: I'll just leave it at that. It slipped out
of my hands, but I'm going to keep it. 15 plus

01:01:07.191 --> 01:01:08.537
what, eight? Plus nine?

01:01:08.537 --> 01:01:11.154
MATT: Plus nine. That'll definitely hit. Go ahead
and roll damage for that.

01:01:11.154 --> 01:01:13.575
LAURA: Okay. Here we go.

01:01:13.575 --> 01:01:15.558
SAM: I hope he can hit a wall.

01:01:15.558 --> 01:01:26.020
LAURA: I don't know, with my ones as of late. Oh,
that's just ten.

01:01:26.020 --> 01:01:28.881
MATT: Ten damage? Including the fire damage?

01:01:28.881 --> 01:01:33.545
LAURA: Oh, yes, right. 13.

01:01:33.545 --> 01:01:40.883
MATT: 13 damage. (whack) The warhammer streaks
through, the light causing this interesting

01:01:40.883 --> 01:01:46.257
shifting of the radius around it. As it smacks
into the ice with this resounding (thwack) sound,

01:01:46.257 --> 01:01:52.003
the ice shakes and shimmers. A giant crack forms
up the front of it, and you can see as he (grunts)

01:01:52.003 --> 01:01:57.055
pulls it out, the wall itself seems to have
largely crumbled in the small space there and

01:01:57.055 --> 01:02:00.332
looks very fragile. But it's definitely left an
impact on the wall.

01:02:00.332 --> 01:02:05.698
TALIESIN: I can make an attempt at this. I'm going
to walk over and study the shattering position and

01:02:05.698 --> 01:02:07.714
see if I can find the weak point in the wall.

01:02:07.714 --> 01:02:09.880
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and make an investigation
check.

01:02:09.880 --> 01:02:16.915
TALIESIN: Seven. Getting it all out of my system
now.

01:02:16.915 --> 01:02:25.442
MATT: The ice wall itself is not a specific
architectural structure. It is made of some sort

01:02:25.442 --> 01:02:30.493
of blasting of ice that froze the air in that way,
so it doesn't have any real geometric positioning,

01:02:30.493 --> 01:02:34.424
but the ice structure itself, you're unable to
make out what would be a weak point or not, other

01:02:34.424 --> 01:02:37.578
than the place of impact where Grog placed the
hammer.

01:02:37.578 --> 01:02:43.567
TALIESIN: I'm going to take a musket ball, go over
to the very center of the crack.

01:02:43.567 --> 01:02:45.878
LAURA: Should we keep a little more quiet than
that?

01:02:45.878 --> 01:02:48.215
FELICIA: Can I use a Fire Bolt? That would be
good, a Fire Bolt.

01:02:48.215 --> 01:02:49.626
TALIESIN: Let's save the Fire Bolt.

01:02:49.626 --> 01:02:55.058
FELICIA: No, it's a cantrip. Is that okay?

01:02:55.058 --> 01:02:56.504
TALIESIN: I'm backing up.

01:02:56.504 --> 01:02:58.388
FELICIA: I'm the leader. I'm going to say I'm
going to.

01:02:58.388 --> 01:03:00.344
TALIESIN: She said, Fire Bolt. I backed away.

01:03:00.344 --> 01:03:06.658
FELICIA: And that is 1d8 fire damage, which is
seven. Seven fire damage.

01:03:06.658 --> 01:03:11.342
MATT: All right. Go ahead and roll to see if you
hit with it. So roll and add your spell attack

01:03:11.342 --> 01:03:12.590
modifier.

01:03:12.590 --> 01:03:18.358
FELICIA: What is that? Oh, it's 12... plus 11. So
that is 23.

01:03:18.358 --> 01:03:21.140
MATT: All right, that definitely hits. How much
damage? That was seven fire damage, you said?

01:03:21.140 --> 01:03:28.887
FELICIA: Oh, it's 3d10 fire. Sorry. Because of my
level. Which is seven and five and seven is 19.

01:03:28.887 --> 01:03:37.381
MATT: Clutching your staff at one side, the book's
under your shoulder, you bring your hand out and

01:03:37.381 --> 01:03:42.618
withdraw your hand with the force of the blast of
the Fire Bolt going forward. As it smacks into the

01:03:42.618 --> 01:03:47.837
section where Grog had slammed the hammer, (boof)
it bursts as a flash of arcane reddish fiery

01:03:47.837 --> 01:03:53.812
energy, and the wall itself shatters inward and
starts falling and crumbling nearby. Now, this

01:03:53.812 --> 01:03:58.762
tall wall, which was about 25 feet tall, begins to
fall in giant chunks.

01:03:58.762 --> 01:04:00.707
FELICIA: (yelps) Sorry!

01:04:00.707 --> 01:04:07.656
MATT: I'm going to go ahead and have Lyra and
Percy and Grog all make dexterity saving throws.

01:04:07.656 --> 01:04:11.001
FELICIA: Oh, I'm so good at that, with the
negatives. Oh!

01:04:11.001 --> 01:04:13.809
LAURA: 19!

01:04:13.809 --> 01:04:15.316
TALIESIN: I can't use acrobatics?

01:04:15.316 --> 01:04:16.806
MATT: No, not for this.

01:04:16.806 --> 01:04:18.440
LAURA: 21 for Grog.

01:04:18.440 --> 01:04:25.657
FELICIA: I rolled a zero, because I've got a
negative two. It's not even on the dice!

01:04:25.657 --> 01:04:26.926
MATT: Percy?

01:04:26.926 --> 01:04:28.097
TALIESIN: Nine.

01:04:28.097 --> 01:04:29.980
MATT: All right, so.

01:04:29.980 --> 01:04:31.639
FELICIA: Is that worse than a critical fail?

01:04:31.639 --> 01:04:37.283
MATT: As the whole wall just (shattering noise)
breaking and falling down around you, you all go

01:04:37.283 --> 01:04:43.284
rushing backward. Grog, strangely and
unexpectedly, shoulder-rolls out of the way, epic

01:04:43.284 --> 01:04:51.265
Geordi La Forge style. Escapes the crumbling wall.
Unfortunately, though, Lyra and Percy stumble

01:04:51.265 --> 01:04:55.735
backward, slipping on the ice that's actually
coated the floor of this cavern, and get impacted

01:04:55.735 --> 01:04:59.143
with part of the fall. It's not too bad, but both
of you suffer 14 points of cold damage and

01:04:59.143 --> 01:05:03.712
bludgeoning. Cold and bludgeoning, as the wall
comes tumbling down on you. However, the rest of

01:05:03.712 --> 01:05:09.582
the cavern now lies open with pieces of jagged ice
almost like a broken glass window itself framing

01:05:09.582 --> 01:05:11.089
the exterior of this tunnel.

01:05:11.089 --> 01:05:14.181
FELICIA: I'm not going to go to the front anymore,
guys.

01:05:14.181 --> 01:05:15.935
SAM: Well, you're the leader, shouldn't you be--

01:05:15.935 --> 01:05:19.506
LAURA: We should protect her. She should be
towards the back.

01:05:19.506 --> 01:05:21.230
TALIESIN: I'm going to heal really quickly.

01:05:21.230 --> 01:05:22.738
MATT: Take another short rest?

01:05:22.738 --> 01:05:26.265
LAURA: We should take a short rest so that we're
going in, you know.

01:05:26.265 --> 01:05:29.905
FELICIA: Yeah. I had scoliosis as a child. I'm not
nimble. It's funny.

01:05:29.905 --> 01:05:35.777
MARY: Before we take a short rest may I, again,
use Awakened Mind, just to see

01:05:35.777 --> 01:05:38.892
how far away we are.

01:05:38.892 --> 01:05:49.300
MATT: You get an image of a slowly ascending and
spiraling tunnel that ascends towards an upper

01:05:49.300 --> 01:05:54.801
cavern at the top of the mountain. The upper
cavern you only get a few glimpses of as they

01:05:54.801 --> 01:06:01.406
themselves have only had a few glimpses of it, but
it appears this is not the only

01:06:01.406 --> 01:06:03.344
obstacle in the way.

01:06:03.344 --> 01:06:04.739
MARY: Oh, good.

01:06:04.739 --> 01:06:07.788
SAM: Let's carry on then.

01:06:07.788 --> 01:06:12.883
LAURA: Could you see when you were looking into
their mind if it is open or if it is just a big

01:06:12.883 --> 01:06:13.968
cavern?

01:06:13.968 --> 01:06:16.103
MARY: I could not see.

01:06:16.103 --> 01:06:24.853
MATT: From the best vantage point you could see,
it was a chamber about, I'd say 80 to 85 feet to

01:06:24.853 --> 01:06:30.636
the ceiling, lined with jagged ice crystals that 
are coalesced in a temperature so cold that it's

01:06:30.636 --> 01:06:38.052
almost like the inside of a geode, but it's all
made of ice. But you see multiple platforms that

01:06:38.052 --> 01:06:43.540
are risen in the walls of this, and in the center,
there is a singular platform, and there sitting on

01:06:43.540 --> 01:06:50.697
the top of it is apparently the dragon quarry you
seek. And then the image shuts itself out, as one

01:06:50.697 --> 01:06:56.182
of them glances over the shoulder. It's growing
uncomfortable with sharing information.

01:06:56.182 --> 01:06:58.560
MARY: Got it. I thank him in my mind.

01:06:58.560 --> 01:07:04.957
MATT: All right. Pressing forward, you can see one
giant still dragging itself forward with a portion

01:07:04.957 --> 01:07:09.010
of its physical body essentially gutted.

01:07:09.010 --> 01:07:14.357
MARY: What if we gave him a half healing potion?

01:07:14.357 --> 01:07:17.557
SAM: Don't mess with the magic.

01:07:17.557 --> 01:07:23.366
LAURA: Because, here's the thing. If they fight
with us, it's great, but if they turn on us then

01:07:23.366 --> 01:07:25.267
we are going to have to fight them at full power
again.

01:07:25.267 --> 01:07:26.794
MARY: Yeah, but we have 24 hours.

01:07:26.794 --> 01:07:33.525
SAM: Yes, but the healing potion might do
something. Let's just keep going. You are a very

01:07:33.525 --> 01:07:35.037
kind soul.

01:07:35.037 --> 01:07:39.547
MATT: So are you guys taking a short rest to heal
up? Okay. If you haven't already rolled your

01:07:39.547 --> 01:07:46.109
dice-- You healed up now? Perfect. All right, so
as you guys continue to trudge up this extremely

01:07:46.109 --> 01:07:55.734
cold-- let me see. I think it'll be a fun one
to-- There we go. You guys continue to ascend up

01:07:55.734 --> 01:08:00.400
this pitch-black cavern here. It appears that both
the giants and the dragon do not need light to

01:08:00.400 --> 01:08:08.904
make their way through this cavern structure. So
you are the small beads of visual lightness in the

01:08:08.904 --> 01:08:15.310
entire structure. The floor itself is slick, and
there are bits of rough rock that you can find

01:08:15.310 --> 01:08:19.597
foot purchase but there are a few moments where 
some of you slip and you lose about ten feet and

01:08:19.597 --> 01:08:24.922
then catch yourself and have to move upward with
this slight 35-degree incline, slowly spiraling

01:08:24.922 --> 01:08:36.855
upward. You push forward for about 30 minutes or
so in this long, seemingly-- for lack of a better

01:08:36.855 --> 01:08:42.631
term, there isn't a lot of changed variation to it;
it's just a gradual spiral in itself.

01:08:42.631 --> 01:08:46.461
LAURA: I want to keep perception out to make sure
that nothing is ahead of us.

01:08:46.461 --> 01:08:49.451
MATT: Go ahead and roll a perception check.

01:08:49.451 --> 01:09:06.913
LAURA: Okay, but this is pertaining to dragons. He
is one of my favored enemies, so I have

01:09:06.913 --> 01:09:13.129
additional bonuses to tracking him and insight
against him. Favored enemies!

01:09:13.129 --> 01:09:16.200
MATT: All right. So you're perceiving anything
dragon-related and things that would be a

01:09:16.200 --> 01:09:18.227
forewarning of a dragon, okay.

01:09:18.227 --> 01:09:20.881
LAURA: Things he would have laid down for us.
Stuff like that.

01:09:20.881 --> 01:09:26.653
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and roll again. You have an
advantage.

01:09:26.653 --> 01:09:29.526
LAURA: You know, just to see. Okay. 18?

01:09:29.526 --> 01:09:35.734
MATT: Okay. Glancing about, you do see there are
claw marks along the walls, you can see where

01:09:35.734 --> 01:09:45.498
portions of this cavern were carved out by the
claws of Rimefang. You can see that occasionally

01:09:45.498 --> 01:09:58.752
there are pieces of frozen rock that are solid
ice, some that appear to be an unthawed chunk of

01:09:58.752 --> 01:10:07.604
flesh of some kind. As you push further up this
cavern, you spot what looks like the lower half of

01:10:07.604 --> 01:10:08.670
a statue.

01:10:08.670 --> 01:10:14.978
FELICIA: Ugh. That's a-- oh my god.

01:10:14.978 --> 01:10:16.457
TALIESIN: That's unpleasant.

01:10:16.457 --> 01:10:18.474
LAURA: Half of a giant, right?

01:10:18.474 --> 01:10:27.724
MATT: This appears to be a frost giant that met
its end. The actual lower half of the torso itself

01:10:27.724 --> 01:10:36.922
is giving off a stench of slowly rotting flesh.
There is ice encasing the lower half of it. It's

01:10:36.922 --> 01:10:42.565
interesting because the physical form of the frost
giants resist cold naturally, and this temperature

01:10:42.565 --> 01:10:50.493
would normally freeze any other flesh completely
solid. Here, it naturally decays. But there is a

01:10:50.493 --> 01:10:54.434
distinct place where the torso was removed
forcibly by what looks like a series of daggers

01:10:54.434 --> 01:10:55.940
and/or dragon's teeth.

01:10:55.940 --> 01:10:58.245
FELICIA: I have little ginger chews, if anybody
wants one.

01:10:58.245 --> 01:10:59.375
TALIESIN: I'll take one.

01:10:59.375 --> 01:11:03.058
FELICIA: Here you go. Thank you. Just in my little
pack here.

01:11:03.058 --> 01:11:09.473
MATT: About ten more minutes of walking, you come
upon another frozen wall barrier.

01:11:09.473 --> 01:11:12.792
SAM: I will check it for traps!

01:11:12.792 --> 01:11:14.553
MATT: Go ahead and roll perception.

01:11:14.553 --> 01:11:17.343
LAURA: (laughs) Thanks, brother.

01:11:17.343 --> 01:11:18.751
SAM: Five.

01:11:18.751 --> 01:11:24.569
MATT: As far as you can tell, it is a
frost/snow-covered ground with walls and a

01:11:24.569 --> 01:11:25.334
ceiling.

01:11:25.334 --> 01:11:27.483
SAM: Everyone. There are definitely no traps
here.

01:11:27.483 --> 01:11:29.967
LAURA: Oh, good. Maybe we should stay back?

01:11:29.967 --> 01:11:35.789
FELICIA: Maybe I could do the Fire Bolt from afar.
That's a good idea, and a leader idea that I had

01:11:35.789 --> 01:11:37.310
that you just reminded me of.

01:11:37.310 --> 01:11:40.406
LAURA: Good thinking, Lyra.

01:11:40.406 --> 01:11:44.701
FELICIA: Thank you. Oh, that definitely hits.
That's 28.

01:11:44.701 --> 01:11:46.813
MATT: 28. Go ahead and roll damage.

01:11:46.813 --> 01:11:51.526
FELICIA: It's a nine and a ten and five. 24.

01:11:51.526 --> 01:11:58.143
MATT: 24. So as you focus, close one eye, and aim,
you release a secondary Fire Bolt. (boosh) It

01:11:58.143 --> 01:12:03.975
slams into the front of the wall of ice, which
immediately bursts inside. Shattered shards of

01:12:03.975 --> 01:12:08.246
glass-like ice go flying further up the cavern.
The rest of it falls and collapses at a distance,

01:12:08.246 --> 01:12:12.488
(crashing) around you. Thankfully, you're all far
enough away where there isn't an issue, and the

01:12:12.488 --> 01:12:13.750
wall seems to have shattered.

01:12:13.750 --> 01:12:18.228
FELICIA: That's the way you do it! Thank you. Oh
my gosh, you guys.

01:12:18.228 --> 01:12:29.425
LAURA: Before we move forward, I've studied
dragons a lot. I just want to say. So obviously we

01:12:29.425 --> 01:12:36.121
all know they're susceptible to fire damage, yes?
This is an ice-breathing bastard. Do as much fire

01:12:36.121 --> 01:12:37.319
attacks as we can.

01:12:37.319 --> 01:12:48.337
MARY: Yes. Don't dragons love, especially white
ones, shiny, sparkly things? Especially gems, from

01:12:48.337 --> 01:12:51.011
what I've gleaned over the years.

01:12:51.011 --> 01:12:55.006
LAURA: If he could be distracted during combat,
maybe.

01:12:55.006 --> 01:13:00.100
FELICIA: A very aggressive person. I got a glimpse
of his attitude, and it is not pleasant.

01:13:00.100 --> 01:13:01.149
LAURA: Not happy.

01:13:01.149 --> 01:13:08.182
FELICIA: No. He is full of bile and vitriol, and
he likes to be worshiped. We could pretend to be

01:13:08.182 --> 01:13:09.500
worshiping him.

01:13:09.500 --> 01:13:13.695
LAURA: But he'll still want to eat us. But yes, we
could do that.

01:13:13.695 --> 01:13:15.524
FELICIA: I mean, he didn't eat these two guys!

01:13:15.524 --> 01:13:17.834
LAURA: It might be something to think about.

01:13:17.834 --> 01:13:20.624
FELICIA: At least to get close to him.

01:13:20.624 --> 01:13:23.197
LAURA: Before we spring an attack, yes.

01:13:23.197 --> 01:13:25.231
MATT: Go ahead and make an intelligence check.

01:13:25.231 --> 01:13:28.066
LAURA: With advantage because it's pertaining to
dragons?

01:13:28.066 --> 01:13:32.263
SAM: (laughs) She's a stickler.

01:13:32.263 --> 01:13:34.627
LAURA: Is that an insight check?

01:13:34.627 --> 01:13:36.815
MATT: That's just adding your intelligence
modifier.

01:13:36.815 --> 01:13:42.375
LAURA: Okay, let me see what that-- oh, that's
Grog's. What am I doing? Okay, so 20 was the first

01:13:42.375 --> 01:13:49.988
roll. 20 is the high roll. Oh, wait! No! 22.

01:13:49.988 --> 01:13:55.545
MATT: 22. Okay. A few things you do know about
dragons, specifically a white dragon, from your

01:13:55.545 --> 01:14:01.539
studying. You lost someone very important to you,
supposedly to a dragon, and so you've spent a lot

01:14:01.539 --> 01:14:08.129
of your life focused on their techniques, their
abilities, how they work. White dragons, you know,

01:14:08.129 --> 01:14:16.163
have complete immunity to cold. Cold damage of all
sorts has no effect on them whatsoever. You know

01:14:16.163 --> 01:14:20.474
that they have capability of flight. They surround
themselves with ice but are not hindered by it

01:14:20.474 --> 01:14:27.147
whatsoever. You do know that their claws and teeth
are extremely dangerous. They themselves also,

01:14:27.147 --> 01:14:34.943
using their wings and tail, become a fierce entity
from all sides. Its cold breath is extremely

01:14:34.943 --> 01:14:41.928
dangerous. It can affect a large area, and even
its presence is frightful enough to where some of

01:14:41.928 --> 01:14:48.041
the most seasoned adventurers go running, fleeing,
or cowering in a corner. Let alone encountering

01:14:48.041 --> 01:14:53.110
one in its lair, itself, it already has an
advantage, as it sets an environment to put it at

01:14:53.110 --> 01:14:58.371
its advantage. So anything and everything you can
do to prepare and be ready for such an encounter

01:14:58.371 --> 01:15:04.611
would be highly recommended. You do get the
sensation that even though they are cold-based,

01:15:04.611 --> 01:15:14.403
fire doesn't necessarily do any additional damage,
but it is not reduced or able to resist it.

01:15:14.403 --> 01:15:19.886
LAURA: It can't resist fire. What about lightning
damage? Do I know anything about that?

01:15:19.886 --> 01:15:26.313
MATT: Best that you know, most magics and other
types of damage other than cold have an effect on

01:15:26.313 --> 01:15:36.207
it, though it does have unnatural resilience to
spells and things for a large part of the combat.

01:15:36.207 --> 01:15:43.397
FELICIA: I can cast Stoneskin on one person. Or up
to, actually-- I could cast Stoneskin

01:15:43.397 --> 01:15:44.848
up to three times.

01:15:44.848 --> 01:15:47.924
MATT: But it's a concentration spell, so you can
only have it up on one person.

01:15:47.924 --> 01:15:53.235
FELICIA: I can only have it on one person at a
time. So who would be most likely to resist

01:15:53.235 --> 01:15:56.624
slashing and bludgeoning and piercing?

01:15:56.624 --> 01:16:01.803
LAURA: Probably Grog. He's going to be the one
that's going to be up close, out of all of us.

01:16:01.803 --> 01:16:06.685
MATT: As Grog says, "That's all right. If I'm
raging, I already have the ability to resist."

01:16:06.685 --> 01:16:09.946
LAURA: That's true. He takes half to piercing and
slashing.

01:16:09.946 --> 01:16:13.411
FELICIA: Oh, okay. So then we need the other
person who might be within range.

01:16:13.411 --> 01:16:16.327
TALIESIN, LAURA, and MARY: Trinket.

01:16:16.327 --> 01:16:17.940
SAM: Trinket's here?

01:16:17.940 --> 01:16:20.194
(laughter)

01:16:20.194 --> 01:16:21.970
MATT: As you look over. (sad bear moan)

01:16:21.970 --> 01:16:23.325
LAURA: Trinket's right there, Scanlan.

01:16:23.325 --> 01:16:25.214
FELICIA: I don't want to demean him, but his
performance is--

01:16:25.214 --> 01:16:27.965
LAURA: Lyra!

01:16:27.965 --> 01:16:30.528
FELICIA: I love him. Of course he gets the spell.

01:16:30.528 --> 01:16:33.853
LAURA: He is really, really cool!

01:16:33.853 --> 01:16:35.187
SAM: He does things!

01:16:35.187 --> 01:16:36.951
FELICIA: Yes, of course, I don't know what I was
thinking.

01:16:36.951 --> 01:16:41.822
LAURA: Here's the thing. If he doesn't have
Stoneskin, I probably won't let him charge.

01:16:41.822 --> 01:16:45.118
TALIESIN: But if he does have Stoneskin, will you
let him charge?

01:16:45.118 --> 01:16:46.315
LAURA: Probably.

01:16:46.315 --> 01:16:52.543
FELICIA: All right, well, that could be another--
Does that seem like a good idea for a bear?

01:16:52.543 --> 01:16:59.873
MARY: Scanlan, are most of your attacks up close
or are they far?

01:16:59.873 --> 01:17:05.503
SAM: I've got a wide range. I like to keep people
guessing. It's my thing.

01:17:05.503 --> 01:17:08.684
FELICIA: But we wouldn't really want you within
claw damage.

01:17:08.684 --> 01:17:10.956
SAM: I wouldn't want that, either.

01:17:10.956 --> 01:17:19.149
FELICIA: It does make more-- I don't mean to
demean Trinket, he is a lovely bear.

01:17:19.149 --> 01:17:23.341
SAM: Of all the bears I've known, he's top five.
Top five.

01:17:23.341 --> 01:17:28.481
MATT: As you're saying this, Trinket senses the
conversation and plants both feet in the ground

01:17:28.481 --> 01:17:29.880
(growls).

01:17:29.880 --> 01:17:32.453
LAURA: See how tough he is?

01:17:32.453 --> 01:17:36.979
MATT: He seems to be showing off. And for a
moment, even though it's a conversation, that's a

01:17:36.979 --> 01:17:38.343
dangerous-looking bear.

01:17:38.343 --> 01:17:45.256
MARY: I use Beast Speak on Trinket. And say,
Trinket, what are you feeling right now? What's

01:17:45.256 --> 01:17:47.149
going on? You seem very excited.

01:17:47.149 --> 01:17:53.501
MATT: Okay, you notice Zahra leans forward and
starts giving this series of low, guttural sounds.

01:17:53.501 --> 01:17:57.978
It's weird. There's this weird arcane interference
and this strange, almost like the sound itself is

01:17:57.978 --> 01:18:02.837
being muffled and stretched. And Trinket turns to
her and starts giving the same noises back.

01:18:02.837 --> 01:18:10.544
Trinket says to you, essentially, "I'll do
whatever it takes to protect my Vex. If this

01:18:10.544 --> 01:18:13.534
"creature tries anything, I will tear its throat
from its head."

01:18:13.534 --> 01:18:15.840
FELICIA: He's a sexier bear than I thought he
was.

01:18:15.840 --> 01:18:20.834
LAURA: And he gives good massages, Lyra.

01:18:20.834 --> 01:18:29.249
FELICIA: Okay. So I will cast Stoneskin. It lasts
an hour, so I'll cast it within the perimeter that

01:18:29.249 --> 01:18:30.642
we think we're going to get hit.

01:18:30.642 --> 01:18:32.579
LAURA: Tell him that I love him very much!

01:18:32.579 --> 01:18:35.833
MARY: I also want to tell you, Trinket. First of
all, boy or girl? Just have to check.

01:18:35.833 --> 01:18:38.174
LAURA: He's a boy! Look at his giant dick.

01:18:38.174 --> 01:18:40.619
MATT: He leans back in a sitting bear position.

01:18:40.619 --> 01:18:51.615
MARY: Thank you, I needed some inspiration for
this fight we're about to do. All right. I also

01:18:51.615 --> 01:18:56.535
want you to know that Vex loves you very much and
will do whatever she can to protect you.

01:18:56.535 --> 01:19:05.433
MATT: As this guttural conversation comes forth,
Trinket comes up to you and nuzzles his nose up

01:19:05.433 --> 01:19:06.716
against your side.

01:19:06.716 --> 01:19:08.034
LAURA: Oh, little buddy!

01:19:08.034 --> 01:19:10.615
FELICIA: I wish Aldor would do that to me.

01:19:10.615 --> 01:19:13.687
SAM and MARY: Show his giant cock to you?

01:19:13.687 --> 01:19:17.151
(laughter)

01:19:17.151 --> 01:19:19.188
FELICIA: I saw it once. It was glorious.

01:19:19.188 --> 01:19:24.582
MARY: Very inspiring.

01:19:24.582 --> 01:19:32.217
MATT: As Lyra's in this memory trance, finishes
casting Stoneskin and reaches out and touches

01:19:32.217 --> 01:19:40.099
Trinket. You can see Trinket's physical form, all
the fur seems to coalesce into a thick rock-type

01:19:40.099 --> 01:19:42.819
exterior shell of magical protection.

01:19:42.819 --> 01:19:44.598
LAURA: What does his armor class raise by?

01:19:44.598 --> 01:19:50.279
MATT: Armor class doesn't change, but all damage
that Trinket takes from bludgeoning, piercing, or

01:19:50.279 --> 01:19:51.994
slashing is reduced by half.

01:19:51.994 --> 01:19:53.090
LAURA: Nice.

01:19:53.090 --> 01:19:57.083
MARY: Thank you, Trinket, lovely to talk to you.

01:19:57.083 --> 01:19:58.615
SAM: What else can we do to prepare?

01:19:58.615 --> 01:20:01.997
LAURA: I promise, Lyra, I will let him attack this
battle.

01:20:01.997 --> 01:20:07.017
FELICIA: Oh good, no, it's fantastic. That invited
so many good thoughts in my mind. I don't mind

01:20:07.017 --> 01:20:09.848
anything at this point. I mean, what?

01:20:09.848 --> 01:20:15.390
MATT: The giants begin to move forward into the
cavern.

01:20:15.390 --> 01:20:16.906
LAURA: It's happening.

01:20:16.906 --> 01:20:21.228
MARY: Yep. Screw your courage to the
sticking-place.

01:20:21.228 --> 01:20:24.528
TALIESIN: Ew. Oh. All right.

01:20:24.528 --> 01:20:30.106
MATT: All right. Scanlan, I want you to go ahead
and roll a dexterity saving throw.

01:20:30.106 --> 01:20:39.070
SAM: Oh boy, already? Dex. 17. Oh. Plus four. 21.

01:20:39.070 --> 01:20:44.789
MATT: 21. As you begin stepping forward up the
cavern where the wall itself has collapsed, you

01:20:44.789 --> 01:20:50.489
step forward onto a part of the ice that is far
more brittle than you expected, and suddenly it

01:20:50.489 --> 01:20:52.106
(cracks) breaks beneath your foot.

01:20:52.106 --> 01:20:53.989
SAM: My Scanlan-sense is tingling!

01:20:53.989 --> 01:20:57.370
MATT: You push off and fall onto your back, and as
you guys look over, you hear the cracking and the

01:20:57.370 --> 01:21:01.815
falling of some sort of stone or ice-like
structure. You see where Scanlan was stepping a

01:21:01.815 --> 01:21:10.509
ten-foot-diameter pit crumbles and falls beneath.
And peering over the inside and using your light,

01:21:10.509 --> 01:21:15.497
you can see there appears to be an arrangement of
razor-sharp ice spikes gathered at the bottom of a

01:21:15.497 --> 01:21:16.555
15-foot pit.

01:21:16.555 --> 01:21:22.431
LAURA: What? Why isn't my brother here? I need to
check for traps from now on. Snoop ahead.

01:21:22.431 --> 01:21:26.978
TALIESIN: I think we've found one. There's a trap
right there.

01:21:26.978 --> 01:21:29.850
SAM: Does that take up our whole path now?

01:21:29.850 --> 01:21:35.568
MATT: The tunnel itself is about 20 feet wide at
this point, so you guys can move around it. The

01:21:35.568 --> 01:21:37.942
giants were ahead of you at this point.

01:21:37.942 --> 01:21:39.387
SAM: Did they laugh?

01:21:39.387 --> 01:21:43.043
MATT: One of them shakes his head and the other
one just keeps walking.

01:21:43.043 --> 01:21:48.324
FELICIA: Gee, I had a spell that would be useful,
but it's not ready.

01:21:48.324 --> 01:21:51.873
SAM: Thanks for that update.

01:21:51.873 --> 01:22:01.930
FELICIA: I'm just being honest. I could've lied,
said that I totally prepared that spell, but I

01:22:01.930 --> 01:22:04.653
could've been knowing Giant the whole time, so I
just.

01:22:04.653 --> 01:22:07.103
LAURA: (laughs) Oops.

01:22:07.103 --> 01:22:12.897
FELICIA: If anybody falls, I can make them fall
gently. That's on the list.

01:22:12.897 --> 01:22:20.136
LAURA: Oh, that's good. Is that Feather Fall?
Nice. Okay, I perceive some more and see if I see

01:22:20.136 --> 01:22:22.086
any traps ahead of us the whole time.

01:22:22.086 --> 01:22:26.320
MATT: All right. You go ahead and make a
perception check as you move forward.

01:22:26.320 --> 01:22:40.246
LAURA: That would be a seven. 15.

01:22:40.246 --> 01:22:51.160
MATT: 15, okay. You guys continue to push upwards
this long spiraling corridor. You reach another

01:22:51.160 --> 01:22:58.582
ice wall that has already been partially broken
from some sort of encounter long ago. You

01:22:58.582 --> 01:23:02.820
immediately see that the part of the wall that is
broken. There's about a ten-foot-wide blocked

01:23:02.820 --> 01:23:08.465
passage, the entirety of that walkway appears to
be another trap, and the giants are waiting back.

01:23:08.465 --> 01:23:14.452
LAURA: Good for you. There's a thing here. We
should not step on it.

01:23:14.452 --> 01:23:18.339
I have one job on this ship!

01:23:18.339 --> 01:23:21.515
MARY: I know it's stupid, but goddamn it, I'm
going to do it.

01:23:21.515 --> 01:23:23.816
SAM: How do we get around? What do we do?

01:23:23.816 --> 01:23:28.535
LAURA: We should maybe break down this ice wall
and then not walk on this area. How about that?

01:23:28.535 --> 01:23:30.368
SAM: Oh. Okay. Let's, yes.

01:23:30.368 --> 01:23:33.460
FELICIA: Oh, good. Should I Firebolt? I mean, I'm
going to Firebolt. From a distance.

01:23:33.460 --> 01:23:37.754
LAURA, FELICIA, MARY, and SAM: (singing) From a
distance, the world is...

01:23:37.754 --> 01:23:41.583
SAM: Beaches.

01:23:41.583 --> 01:23:44.794
FELICIA: That's a 30.

01:23:44.794 --> 01:23:46.870
MATT: 30. Go ahead and roll some damage.

01:23:46.870 --> 01:23:50.087
FELICIA: Yeah! Nine and eight and a ten, these are
good rolls. That's a 27.

01:23:50.087 --> 01:23:57.157
MATT: 27. This bolt arcs around from the side. You
hit it right at the point where half of the wall

01:23:57.157 --> 01:24:00.868
had collapsed, causing the other half of the wall
to immediately shatter and collapse inward,

01:24:00.868 --> 01:24:06.696
spraying bits of ice and rock against the wall on
that side. The ground becomes rough terrain in

01:24:06.696 --> 01:24:11.990
that general vicinity, but it's easy enough to
traverse over without any serious issue. As you

01:24:11.990 --> 01:24:16.035
guys step over, and the giants make their way
across, stepping over it entirely with their long

01:24:16.035 --> 01:24:24.561
gait. You move carefully over the shattered wall
bits, but the ground itself seems solid. You get

01:24:24.561 --> 01:24:26.709
past without issue.

01:24:26.709 --> 01:24:31.063
LAURA: Before we go into the actual lair of the
dragon-- once we get to it; I don't know much more

01:24:31.063 --> 01:24:40.499
of these thingies there are. Do we want to go in
as if we're offering it something and saying, hey,

01:24:40.499 --> 01:24:44.411
we love you, we want to bring you people, and
stuff like that?

01:24:44.411 --> 01:24:46.113
MARY: We are here to serve you?

01:24:46.113 --> 01:24:52.739
LAURA: Or do we want to send somebody in first and
act like they're here to serve it, and then we all

01:24:52.739 --> 01:24:55.497
spring in and surprise it? What do you want to
do?

01:24:55.497 --> 01:24:57.524
SAM: They like to eat giants.

01:24:57.524 --> 01:25:03.255
LAURA: It wants to eat anything frozen, basically.
It freezes things, and then it eats them.

01:25:03.255 --> 01:25:07.122
FELICIA: Well, there was another party that the
guild-- the guild did send another party.

01:25:07.122 --> 01:25:10.410
LAURA: I don't know if they had a method or if
they just walked right in.

01:25:10.410 --> 01:25:15.481
TALIESIN: Perhaps if we're quiet and stealthy. Can
we be quiet and stealthy?

01:25:15.481 --> 01:25:16.554
FELICIA: I can't!

01:25:16.554 --> 01:25:19.542
MARY: I can cast Invisibility.

01:25:19.542 --> 01:25:22.206
FELICIA: Ooh, I can cast Invisibility on myself.

01:25:22.206 --> 01:25:23.601
SAM: That would help.

01:25:23.601 --> 01:25:30.117
MARY: So learning of the dragon, will it be able
to detect us if we cast Invisibility?

01:25:30.117 --> 01:25:36.688
FELICIA: That's nature? That would be a nature
check or animal handling?

01:25:36.688 --> 01:25:39.896
MATT: This would be an intelligence check.

01:25:39.896 --> 01:25:45.782
FELICIA: Oh. Well, I can do that. That's a 30--
that's a 23.

01:25:45.782 --> 01:25:54.257
MATT: Okay, so what you've read of dragons, their
ability to sense their surroundings is adapted to

01:25:54.257 --> 01:25:58.475
all environments, whether they can see or not.
They actually have the ability to see with no

01:25:58.475 --> 01:26:05.832
sight necessary to a certain extent, so
invisibility would help at a distance, quite a bit

01:26:05.832 --> 01:26:11.384
of distance, but within a certain point it is able
to sense your presence whether or not it can see

01:26:11.384 --> 01:26:16.183
you. Also note, if you cast Invisibility you lose
your concentration spell on Trinket.

01:26:16.183 --> 01:26:20.430
FELICIA: Oh, so let's not do that. Now, his vanity,
he does like being worshipped.

01:26:20.430 --> 01:26:22.033
So that is the key.

01:26:22.033 --> 01:26:23.908
SAM: So we could go in with an offering.

01:26:23.908 --> 01:26:29.675
LAURA: An offering. What if we laid a trap in the
offering? What if we used your frag grenade that

01:26:29.675 --> 01:26:33.592
you did. Is it a bomb? Does it set off on a timer?
Is it very fragile?

01:26:33.592 --> 01:26:41.276
TALIESIN: I have to set it off personally. I
actually have to shoot it to set it off.

01:26:41.276 --> 01:26:45.711
MARY: So smile, you son of a bitch, basically, if
we put it in his mouth?

01:26:45.711 --> 01:26:53.070
LAURA: Do we have any bombs or anything like that?
Because I have a very big beautiful diamond of

01:26:53.070 --> 01:26:59.257
awesomeness that we uncovered before that I keep
about. We could present him with this big,

01:26:59.257 --> 01:27:03.241
huge-ass diamond and then have it trapped with
some sort of exploding device.

01:27:03.241 --> 01:27:04.641
SAM: We could.

01:27:04.641 --> 01:27:07.255
FELICIA: If he picks the diamond up off of the--

01:27:07.255 --> 01:27:13.782
LAURA: We could put it in a bag and then put the
diamond on top of a bomb or something, and then

01:27:13.782 --> 01:27:16.180
when he picks it up and like, (explosion) in his
face.

01:27:16.180 --> 01:27:22.834
TALIESIN: That's hoping for an awful lot of things
to go our way. More things than normally go our

01:27:22.834 --> 01:27:24.287
way, to be fair.

01:27:24.287 --> 01:27:32.799
FELICIA: Well, it seems worthy of trying to get
close to him, because his attacks-- Would he as a

01:27:32.799 --> 01:27:35.197
dragon have a very good length attack?

01:27:35.197 --> 01:27:43.965
MATT: Yeah, as a dragon has some decent reach with
some of its attacks. Its bite, and its length of

01:27:43.965 --> 01:27:48.524
neck and ability to bite actually has quite a bit
of reach. Also, its tail has quite some reach, as

01:27:48.524 --> 01:27:51.709
well. It can cover some decent ground just with
its physical form.

01:27:51.709 --> 01:27:55.008
FELICIA: The thing is, obviously the trolls don't
come up here a lot or there wouldn't be so much

01:27:55.008 --> 01:28:01.095
ice in here. Walls. So I think that's a problem,
so it's not as if they come up here all the time

01:28:01.095 --> 01:28:02.952
to give it treats. Right?

01:28:02.952 --> 01:28:09.188
SAM: We could just walk in there. I could be
holding Lyra as my captive and say, I've brought

01:28:09.188 --> 01:28:10.639
you this captive to eat.

01:28:10.639 --> 01:28:12.272
FELICIA: I don't like that one.

01:28:12.272 --> 01:28:14.055
SAM: Well, you know, you're very appealing.

01:28:14.055 --> 01:28:19.501
MARY: We still don't know that the giants aren't
going to help us.

01:28:19.501 --> 01:28:22.838
MATT: As you guys are stepping forward up the
pathway, you turn a corner and you can see the

01:28:22.838 --> 01:28:28.363
giants have stopped, and they have a physical
trepidation to the way that they're leaning

01:28:28.363 --> 01:28:34.679
backward in their stance. As you turn the corner,
the little bit of light that reaches out, you can

01:28:34.679 --> 01:28:39.613
see there appears to be one final ice wall that
has a ten-foot opening where it's left as a

01:28:39.613 --> 01:28:42.377
pathway, and it opens into a darkened chamber.

01:28:42.377 --> 01:28:55.622
MARY: Well, I have darkvision for 60 feet, so I
could approach around the side and peer in and just

01:28:55.622 --> 01:28:58.612
see what's there, 60 feet ahead.

01:28:58.612 --> 01:29:06.143
MATT: Okay, so you walk up past the giants to this
entrance? All right. As you walk forward, you see

01:29:06.143 --> 01:29:10.401
your vision spill out in the darkness, with a
little bit of dim light and the darkness before

01:29:10.401 --> 01:29:16.347
you reveals itself. You can see a smattering of
broken bits along the ground, looks like rocks and

01:29:16.347 --> 01:29:26.125
ice, a frozen leg of some humanoid, an arm, some
scattered, broken armor and weapons. There are

01:29:26.125 --> 01:29:33.475
pieces of what appears to be a frozen-over
graveyard of previous attempts towards inhabiting

01:29:33.475 --> 01:29:38.977
this room. And as you continue to push forward
towards the edge, just towards the perimeter as

01:29:38.977 --> 01:29:45.186
far as your vision can see at this doorway, you
see a central platform in the middle of this giant

01:29:45.186 --> 01:29:51.688
chamber that rises up about 15 feet. Ten, 15 feet,
and just cresting over the top of this platform is

01:29:51.688 --> 01:30:02.997
the edge of an alabaster snout, with teeth
overlapping. You hear this (snarls) growling

01:30:02.997 --> 01:30:12.391
snarl. And this little voice spills out from
underneath and says, "Why don't you enter? If

01:30:12.391 --> 01:30:20.444
"you're going to arrive and present yourselves, do
not cower yet."

01:30:20.444 --> 01:30:23.551
FELICIA: Get that diamond out!

01:30:23.551 --> 01:30:25.798
MATT: And with that, we're going to go ahead and
take a break.

01:30:25.798 --> 01:30:27.715
(shouting)

01:30:27.715 --> 01:30:32.395
MATT: We're going to take a quick ten-minute break
to go ahead and use the bathroom, get a little

01:30:32.395 --> 01:30:34.139
snack. Yes?

01:30:34.139 --> 01:30:36.539
ZAC: We're eight subscribers away from another
giveaway.

01:30:36.539 --> 01:30:39.231
(cheering)

01:30:39.231 --> 01:30:43.608
ZAC: The giveaway includes a signed player's
handbook by all your wonderful hosts, as well as

01:30:43.608 --> 01:30:48.290
the hosts that will be here next week, and a
signed copy of Felicia Day's new book.

01:30:48.290 --> 01:30:52.026
FELICIA: My new book! It's right there! I signed
it.

01:30:52.026 --> 01:30:53.397
SAM: What's it called? What's the title?

01:30:53.397 --> 01:30:55.185
FELICIA: It's called You're Never Weird on the
Internet (Almost).

01:30:55.185 --> 01:30:57.355
SAM: Aw. That's cool.

01:30:57.355 --> 01:30:58.609
FELICIA: It's amusing.

01:30:58.609 --> 01:31:00.492
ZAC: Are you weird in real life all the time?

01:31:00.492 --> 01:31:02.094
FELICIA: No, I mean, look at me.

01:31:02.094 --> 01:31:04.638
ZAC: No. Definitely not.

01:31:04.638 --> 01:31:05.935
FELICIA: I don't believe your face.

01:31:05.935 --> 01:31:09.693
SAM: Did you consider the title Day Dreaming?

01:31:09.693 --> 01:31:11.341
FELICIA: You're pretty.

01:31:11.341 --> 01:31:13.912
SAM: I just thought, because it's like a pun.

01:31:13.912 --> 01:31:15.922
FELICIA: No, that's awful.

01:31:15.922 --> 01:31:17.672
SAM: Consider it.

01:31:17.672 --> 01:31:22.560
MATT: Somewhere, someone's holding their
manuscript entitled Day Dreaming and going

01:31:22.560 --> 01:31:24.081
(fake crying).

01:31:24.081 --> 01:31:25.595
(laughter)

01:31:25.595 --> 01:31:29.254
MATT: All right, guys, we'll take a quick break,
we'll see you back in ten minutes or so to see how

01:31:29.254 --> 01:31:30.650
this goes.

01:31:30.650 --> 01:46:19.098
[break]

01:46:19.098 --> 01:46:22.168
MATT: Welcome back from the break! Our fantastic
Travis finally made it.

01:46:22.168 --> 01:46:24.773
(cheering)

01:46:24.773 --> 01:46:27.506
TRAVIS: I heard I rolled really well in the
beginning of this.

01:46:27.506 --> 01:46:29.243
MATT: Yeah, it went wonderfully.

01:46:29.243 --> 01:46:34.165
LAURA: Sorry. But your Chain of Returning is
attached to your blazing warhammer now.

01:46:34.165 --> 01:46:39.793
MATT: There you go. So as it ends up, we have a
new winner. KadenPhilly is the winner,

01:46:39.793 --> 01:46:44.919
congratulations, of our next giveaway. So we'll be
giving away the player's handbook, the signed

01:46:44.919 --> 01:46:49.807
photo, a copy of Felicia's book-- yay!-- and a
bunch of other goodies coming your way soon, so

01:46:49.807 --> 01:46:54.987
make sure you get your information to the
Overlord. We'll have another giveaway at 5,800, if

01:46:54.987 --> 01:46:58.949
we can get to there by the end of the show
tonight, so let's see if we can hit that. In the

01:46:58.949 --> 01:47:00.448
meantime, guys--

01:47:00.448 --> 01:47:02.948
TRAVIS: Shit.

01:47:02.948 --> 01:47:05.525
MARY: Yeah. Welcome to the shit.

01:47:05.525 --> 01:47:07.766
TRAVIS: I've been watching in the car.

01:47:07.766 --> 01:47:11.358
MATT: You guys have all been making your way
through the cavern back here. Zahra has stepped

01:47:11.358 --> 01:47:17.257
forward and in the darkness, you can see right
here at the edge a form.

01:47:17.257 --> 01:47:19.948
FELICIA: He's up above us, though.

01:47:19.948 --> 01:47:24.228
MATT: Yep. About ten, 15 feet up on this platform,
leaning over the edge is Rimefang, staring at you

01:47:24.228 --> 01:47:27.850
through the darkness. A claw comes forward and
beckons.

01:47:27.850 --> 01:47:33.183
LAURA: Can I, from here, before we go in there--
I'm going to cast Hunter's Mark on him.

01:47:33.183 --> 01:47:34.521
MATT: You can't see him right now.

01:47:34.521 --> 01:47:35.865
MARY: I can.

01:47:35.865 --> 01:47:36.985
MATT: Zahra can.

01:47:36.985 --> 01:47:39.758
TRAVIS: I can, too. I've got my belt of dwarven
darkvision.

01:47:39.758 --> 01:47:41.525
FELICIA: Is he speaking dragon?

01:47:41.525 --> 01:47:42.764
MATT: Speaking Common.

01:47:42.764 --> 01:47:44.178
FELICIA: He's speaking Common. Okay.

01:47:44.178 --> 01:47:51.022
MARY: Would he detect if I would cast anything on
him at the moment? I don't know! Then I'm going to

01:47:51.022 --> 01:47:53.227
sit here and drink my drink.

01:47:53.227 --> 01:47:56.433
TRAVIS: Are you offering him that jewel, or did we
ditch that idea?

01:47:56.433 --> 01:47:58.053
LAURA: No, are we doing that?

01:47:58.053 --> 01:48:02.512
SAM: We might. Depends what he asks. Yeah, let's
do it.

01:48:02.512 --> 01:48:04.389
TRAVIS: Yeah, roll it out like a tennis ball for a
dog.

01:48:04.389 --> 01:48:08.605
TALIESIN: Do we have a little bag we can put the
jewels in?

01:48:08.605 --> 01:48:09.894
LAURA: Yeah.

01:48:09.894 --> 01:48:12.824
SAM: We don't have time to do any of this stuff.

01:48:12.824 --> 01:48:14.183
LAURA: Yeah, we do.

01:48:14.183 --> 01:48:18.922
TALIESIN: We have a second. I'm going to hand you
my Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch. Why not?

01:48:18.922 --> 01:48:20.711
TRAVIS: You can Hold Monster?

01:48:20.711 --> 01:48:22.909
MARY: I can Hold Monster. Yeah, we both can.

01:48:22.909 --> 01:48:24.453
TRAVIS: Does he qualify as a monster?

01:48:24.453 --> 01:48:27.549
MATT: As far as you know, dragon's pretty much a
monster.

01:48:27.549 --> 01:48:39.786
LAURA: I am putting Percy's hand grenade inside
this bag along with a diamond. Oh, it's a really

01:48:39.786 --> 01:48:40.960
pretty diamond.

01:48:40.960 --> 01:48:42.689
TALIESIN: We'll get it back, it's okay.

01:48:42.689 --> 01:48:44.009
LAURA: As long as it doesn't explode.

01:48:44.009 --> 01:48:47.609
TALIESIN: You can't explode a diamond.

01:48:47.609 --> 01:48:49.260
LAURA: That's true, diamonds are really strong.

01:48:49.260 --> 01:48:50.944
TALIESIN: Diamonds are forever.

01:48:50.944 --> 01:48:55.196
LAURA: I put that in the bag. Are we tossing this
at him? What are we doing?

01:48:55.196 --> 01:48:58.649
SAM: No! We walk in. He's beckoning us. Let's walk
in. I'm walking in.

01:48:58.649 --> 01:49:01.081
MATT: All right, so you guys all walk in?

01:49:01.081 --> 01:49:04.584
SAM: I'm going ahead.

01:49:04.584 --> 01:49:06.547
LAURA: Here, hold the bag.

01:49:06.547 --> 01:49:07.651
SAM: I'll take the bag.

01:49:07.651 --> 01:49:09.557
MATT: Zahra, are you staying ahead with Scanlan?

01:49:09.557 --> 01:49:13.212
FELICIA: I believe that you squishy people should
be back here!

01:49:13.212 --> 01:49:15.328
TRAVIS: I'm not squishy, I go with them.

01:49:15.328 --> 01:49:22.018
MATT: As a note, as you guys are walking through
and the light hits the walls, you begin to see the

01:49:22.018 --> 01:49:27.375
ice itself, which you've become accustomed to, is
now being broken up into what looks like little

01:49:27.375 --> 01:49:34.202
glittering stars. It's almost like you're walking
through a frozen area of the night sky. You

01:49:34.202 --> 01:49:39.685
realize that there are gold pieces frozen in
sporadically all throughout the wall, the floor,

01:49:39.685 --> 01:49:45.922
the ceiling here. The actual, whatever wealth this
dragon has acquired is in some way shape or form

01:49:45.922 --> 01:49:54.510
embedded in its own lair. Anyway. So we have the
three of you up front. Who's up next? I imagine

01:49:54.510 --> 01:49:55.578
we've got Trinket.

01:49:55.578 --> 01:49:56.871
LAURA: Yeah. Me.

01:49:56.871 --> 01:49:58.923
MATT: All right, so you guys all continue to move
forward?

01:49:58.923 --> 01:50:01.169
MARY: Not too close!

01:50:01.169 --> 01:50:02.359
LAURA: Scanlan!

01:50:02.359 --> 01:50:05.662
MATT: There? Where do you want to stop? You guys
have laser pointers to use, by the way, if you

01:50:05.662 --> 01:50:07.100
want to point out wherever you want to be.

01:50:07.100 --> 01:50:10.229
LAURA: Scanlan should definitely talk to him.

01:50:10.229 --> 01:50:12.233
TALIESIN: I would like to go around here.

01:50:12.233 --> 01:50:21.456
FELICIA: Oh glorious Rimefang, we have an offering
for you!

01:50:21.456 --> 01:50:22.624
TALIESIN: That's not me.

01:50:22.624 --> 01:50:23.927
SAM: Is that you? Hello.

01:50:23.927 --> 01:50:26.772
MATT: No, that was you, sorry. So Percy goes
here.

01:50:26.772 --> 01:50:30.817
LAURA: Over by Percy. But further.

01:50:30.817 --> 01:50:34.129
FELICIA: Is that 90 feet?

01:50:34.129 --> 01:50:37.386
SAM: It's less than that. We're 30 feet away now.

01:50:37.386 --> 01:50:41.530
LAURA: Oh, come on, giants. Help us out.

01:50:41.530 --> 01:50:51.191
MATT: So as you guys enter the chamber, the actual
air here is more still and cold than at any point

01:50:51.191 --> 01:50:58.819
of the interior of the cavern has been. Even
breathing inward hurts in itself as the freezing

01:50:58.819 --> 01:51:05.292
air hits your lungs. Rimefang sits there, perched
on top of this central platform, grinning down

01:51:05.292 --> 01:51:11.787
towards the rest of the group. You, who have
shouted this out, Lyra, about having an offering.

01:51:11.787 --> 01:51:16.655
Rimefang immediately leans forward. "An offering,
you say?"

01:51:16.655 --> 01:51:22.529
LAURA: I want to make my way further up. While
he's talking, I want to make my way along the wall

01:51:22.529 --> 01:51:23.400
a little.

01:51:23.400 --> 01:51:27.002
MATT: Make a stealth check.

01:51:27.002 --> 01:51:33.503
LAURA: Oh no. 20! Natural 20! And all I needed was
fried chicken!

01:51:33.503 --> 01:51:36.929
(laughter)

01:51:36.929 --> 01:51:38.535
TRAVIS: It's true.

01:51:38.535 --> 01:51:45.855
MATT: All right, so. You, somehow, manage to dart
out of the visual reference of a very focused

01:51:45.855 --> 01:51:52.437
adult white dragon. Rimefang does not seem to
gather any movement, and you vanish into the side.

01:51:52.437 --> 01:51:54.030
Where do you want to go?

01:51:54.030 --> 01:51:58.099
LAURA: A little bit further. There. That sounds
good.

01:51:58.099 --> 01:52:02.072
MATT: Okay. Percy, as you're stepping over you
realize you're stepping onto what looks like the

01:52:02.072 --> 01:52:07.592
broken lower half of another giant that has fallen
over, a booted leg and part of an eaten armored

01:52:07.592 --> 01:52:15.496
torso to your back. As you begin to look through,
you also see there currently frozen in place three

01:52:15.496 --> 01:52:19.790
other individuals that are in mid-battle and are
frozen solid.

01:52:19.790 --> 01:52:23.755
LAURA: If we unfreeze them, they could help us.

01:52:23.755 --> 01:52:26.232
FELICIA: They're probably dead in there.

01:52:26.232 --> 01:52:28.617
TRAVIS: We're standing in front of a dragon!

01:52:28.617 --> 01:52:30.403
SAM: Rimefang?

01:52:30.403 --> 01:52:37.392
MARY: Oh great Rimefang! What a glorious moon you
are amidst the stars of your treasure.

01:52:37.392 --> 01:52:39.115
TRAVIS: Oh, pour it on, why don't you?

01:52:39.115 --> 01:52:41.392
(laughter)

01:52:41.392 --> 01:52:43.480
MARY: We do have an offering for you.

01:52:43.480 --> 01:52:50.211
SAM: Yes. And I use Mage Hand to lift the diamond
out of the bag and dangle it in front of the

01:52:50.211 --> 01:52:55.817
dragon. We've brought you this diamond. We've come
from the Slayer's Take. We represent the guild and

01:52:55.817 --> 01:53:01.672
we are here to formally apologize for sending a
few of our members here in the past and promise

01:53:01.672 --> 01:53:08.952
that we never shall again, and as a gift of
apology and hopefully brotherhood, we offer you

01:53:08.952 --> 01:53:11.370
this diamond. There are many more to come.

01:53:11.370 --> 01:53:12.940
TALIESIN: And everything else in the bag, as
well.

01:53:12.940 --> 01:53:16.220
LAURA: And then you put it back in the bag. And
then you give it to him.

01:53:16.220 --> 01:53:26.902
MATT: There's this low, guttural snarl (snarls).
It leans forward, sneaking down off the perch a

01:53:26.902 --> 01:53:32.288
little bit. Its head moves forward and stretches
outward, no more than maybe ten feet from your

01:53:32.288 --> 01:53:38.583
face. You can see it inspecting the diamond as
you're holding it by the Mage Hand, floating above

01:53:38.583 --> 01:53:50.946
the rest of the bag. Chuckles to itself.
(chuckles) "This is your measly offering?"

01:53:50.946 --> 01:53:56.870
SAM: There is a diamond of much greater size and
value in this pouch. But first, we want to hear

01:53:56.870 --> 01:54:02.272
that you are going to allow us safe passage out of
here before we turn it over to you.

01:54:02.272 --> 01:54:04.801
MATT: Persuasion check.

01:54:04.801 --> 01:54:09.545
ZAC: Guys, just so you know, the stream's
buffering, so hold. Twitch problems.

01:54:09.545 --> 01:54:11.463
FELICIA: Oh no.

01:54:11.463 --> 01:54:13.271
ZAC: Hold for buffer.

01:54:13.271 --> 01:54:15.943
MATT: Do we know at what point it started
buffering?

01:54:15.943 --> 01:54:19.268
ZAC: You're back up. Missing the last two
sentences. Buffer over.

01:54:19.268 --> 01:54:28.841
SAM: Please allow us safe passage. And then you
said roll for persuasion, and I rolled a 19.

01:54:28.841 --> 01:54:41.318
MATT: Rimefang's head withdraws back and its claws
pull back on top of the platform. It lifts its

01:54:41.318 --> 01:54:50.813
head up, looking down at you with this very
disinterested, snooty look (huffs). As it snorts

01:54:50.813 --> 01:54:57.246
out of its nose, this puff of frost shoots out and
crystals of ice fall and clatter to the ground

01:54:57.246 --> 01:54:58.481
around it.

01:54:58.481 --> 01:55:00.207
SAM: That was so cool.

01:55:00.207 --> 01:55:11.536
MATT: "You. You trespass into my domain, your
voices bickering and bouncing off the walls,

01:55:11.536 --> 01:55:26.203
"annoying me, waking me from my slumber. My freshly
eaten slumber. I am curious, before you so walk

01:55:26.298 --> 01:55:39.087
"into my dinner table, why you seem to have gotten
past my guardians?" At which point the two giants

01:55:39.087 --> 01:55:44.550
who are standing behind you look over at each
other nervously.

01:55:44.550 --> 01:55:50.252
SAM: Your guardians are well aware of our power
and position and did not want to offend you by

01:55:50.252 --> 01:55:51.736
turning us away.

01:55:51.736 --> 01:56:08.036
MATT: "Are you to tell me I spared your
insignificant lives so you could let this

01:56:08.036 --> 01:56:15.035
"insulting, insufferable insect into the heart of
my domain?"

01:56:15.035 --> 01:56:22.229
SAM: I'm called Burt Reynolds, and I take great
offense at that.

01:56:22.229 --> 01:56:28.478
MATT: The dragon's head turns to the side for a
moment as a glance of confusion and almost

01:56:28.478 --> 01:56:38.883
amusement that you speak up to it with such a
disrespectful manner. (evil laughter)

01:56:38.883 --> 01:56:42.671
SAM: You can call me Mr. Reynolds or simply Burt.

01:56:42.671 --> 01:56:52.666
MATT: (heavy impacts) Its claws dig in and tighten
on the edges of this platform. You can see the

01:56:52.666 --> 01:56:58.016
stonework and the ice crack and shatter under its
grip as pieces of stone tumble down the edges of

01:56:58.016 --> 01:57:04.162
the platform, scattering across the ground with a
slight clattering. The wings (whoosh) unfurl

01:57:04.162 --> 01:57:09.875
outward. Its head looks down upon you directly.

01:57:09.875 --> 01:57:11.289
"Burt."

01:57:11.289 --> 01:57:18.410
(laughter)

01:57:18.410 --> 01:57:27.913
MATT: "You say you're from the Slayer's Take. I
have not lived these hundred years or so to become

01:57:27.913 --> 01:57:43.074
"the hunted. I am the hunter! I am the scourge of
the Thorain Tundra! I am the stalker of this

01:57:43.074 --> 01:57:56.253
"timberland. Well. Parts of you shall adorn my
walls, glittering in pieces for times to come.

01:57:56.253 --> 01:58:06.651
"Giants. To my side! Tonight, you choose whether I
dine on you or just them."

01:58:06.651 --> 01:58:10.043
MARY: I use-- fuck me.

01:58:10.043 --> 01:58:12.662
(laughter)

01:58:12.662 --> 01:58:14.941
TALIESIN: I don't know if you have that spell.

01:58:14.941 --> 01:58:17.362
FELICIA: Really, what's the DC on that?

01:58:17.362 --> 01:58:25.633
MARY: It's very high! I use Awakened Mind to once
more say, now we have seen what you have been

01:58:25.633 --> 01:58:33.483
through. We see the terror that you face every day
from this awful beast. This is your chance. You

01:58:33.483 --> 01:58:39.766
may not have another. Fight him with us and
destroy this beast forever.

01:58:39.766 --> 01:58:43.663
MATT: Make a persuasion check versus the dragon's
intimidation check.

01:58:43.663 --> 01:58:47.274
SAM: Oh, versus a dragon!

01:58:47.274 --> 01:58:56.773
LAURA: Natural 20 all the way. Natural 20. I've
had my bow notched, and I cast Hunter's Mark while

01:58:56.773 --> 01:58:58.213
all this is going on.

01:58:58.213 --> 01:59:03.744
MARY: 18. 18 plus what?

01:59:03.744 --> 01:59:05.753
SAM: What is it, persuasion?

01:59:05.753 --> 01:59:07.165
MATT: Persuasion.

01:59:07.165 --> 01:59:11.305
MARY: Plus nine. 27.

01:59:11.305 --> 01:59:19.126
MATT: The giants look at each other, and they look
down at the rest of you. They pull their axes out,

01:59:19.126 --> 01:59:25.140
shields at the ready, and look back up at
Rimefang, and in Giant you hear, muttered under

01:59:25.140 --> 01:59:27.980
their breath, "It's now or never."

01:59:27.980 --> 01:59:29.837
(cheering)

01:59:29.837 --> 01:59:31.245
MATT: Roll initiative.

01:59:31.245 --> 01:59:32.703
MARY: Yes!

01:59:32.703 --> 01:59:38.386
LAURA, FELICIA, and TALIESIN: Oh my god.

01:59:38.386 --> 01:59:40.789
FELICIA: Oh, I rolled lower!

01:59:40.789 --> 01:59:42.512
LAURA: I rolled a 20.

01:59:42.512 --> 01:59:44.168
TALIESIN: I rolled another 20.

01:59:44.168 --> 01:59:45.491
LAURA: Me too!

01:59:45.491 --> 01:59:48.167
TRAVIS: What is it with you and your 20s?

01:59:48.167 --> 01:59:50.671
TALIESIN: I don't know! I don't know what
happened.

01:59:50.671 --> 01:59:55.245
MATT: Okay, all right. 25 to 20, anyone?

01:59:55.245 --> 01:59:56.395
LAURA: 25.

01:59:56.395 --> 01:59:57.610
TALIESIN: 28.

01:59:57.610 --> 01:59:58.896
MARY: What?!

01:59:58.896 --> 02:00:06.434
MATT: All right. We have Percy, we have Vex,
leaving that up there. All right,

02:00:06.434 --> 02:00:09.420
we have 20 to 15?

02:00:09.420 --> 02:00:12.899
TRAVIS: 19.

02:00:12.899 --> 02:00:17.385
MATT: 19, nice. 15 to ten?

02:00:17.385 --> 02:00:20.484
MARY: 12.

02:00:20.484 --> 02:00:23.990
MATT: 12. Zahra, 12. Ten to five?

02:00:23.990 --> 02:00:25.371
SAM: Seven.

02:00:25.371 --> 02:00:27.640
MATT: Seven for Scanlan. (laughing) what did you
roll?

02:00:27.640 --> 02:00:30.833
FELICIA: Negative one!

02:00:30.833 --> 02:00:33.432
(laughter)

02:00:33.432 --> 02:00:35.076
MARY: That's our leader!

02:00:35.076 --> 02:00:36.316
MATT: Did you roll a natural one?

02:00:36.316 --> 02:00:38.737
FELICIA: I rolled a one, and I have a negative
two.

02:00:38.737 --> 02:00:41.042
TRAVIS: On your initiative?!

02:00:41.042 --> 02:00:45.303
FELICIA: Yes! I'm never going. I'm going to just
have a snack.

02:00:45.303 --> 02:00:47.938
TRAVIS: You break out the trail mix.

02:00:47.938 --> 02:00:50.382
TALIESIN: The little gingers come back out.

02:00:50.382 --> 02:00:54.764
FELICIA: Is that a record?

02:00:54.764 --> 02:00:59.549
TRAVIS: That is a record. I don't think we've ever
had a negative initiative.

02:00:59.549 --> 02:01:06.567
MATT: All right, so as the wings unfurl on top of
this platform, the combat round

02:01:06.567 --> 02:01:08.505
begins with Percy.

02:01:08.505 --> 02:01:12.586
TALIESIN: If I take one shot, can I hold my second
shot until an event? Can I time my second shot?

02:01:12.586 --> 02:01:14.883
MATT: No, you'd have to hold your initiative, or
you do all your actions in one round,

02:01:14.883 --> 02:01:15.984
unfortunately.

02:01:15.984 --> 02:01:18.186
TALIESIN: Darn it. What initiative did you roll,
again?

02:01:18.186 --> 02:01:19.814
SAM: Low. Second to last.

02:01:19.814 --> 02:01:32.628
TALIESIN: In that case, I'm going to take a few
steps behind that frozen creature right there. I'm

02:01:32.628 --> 02:01:34.586
going to pull out Bad News.

02:01:34.586 --> 02:01:38.445
MARY, SAM, and TALIESIN: (singing) Bad News!

02:01:38.445 --> 02:01:44.088
TALIESIN: I'm going to aim for the face. I'm going
to take a head shot on him.

02:01:44.088 --> 02:01:48.755
MATT: Okay, the frozen warrior is in front of
you.

02:01:48.755 --> 02:01:51.107
TALIESIN: I'm just using him as partial cover.

02:01:51.107 --> 02:01:53.976
MATT: Okay, so you're behind the creature. Are you
just putting it on it to aim?

02:01:53.976 --> 02:01:58.909
TALIESIN: More or less. I'm using him as a steady
and as partial cover as I take a head shot on the

02:01:58.909 --> 02:02:07.755
dragon. I'm not taking a bonus for damage, no. Oh.
15?

02:02:07.755 --> 02:02:14.302
MATT: 15 unfortunately does not hit. As you shoot,
(gunshot), it actually hits the body but the

02:02:14.302 --> 02:02:19.186
hardness of the dragon's scales ricochets the shot
off, (ricochet sound), you see it impact on some

02:02:19.186 --> 02:02:21.186
part of the far side of the cavern.

02:02:21.186 --> 02:02:27.928
TALIESIN: I'm going to burn a bonus action and
spend another grit point and do another shot.

02:02:27.928 --> 02:02:30.288
MATT: So you're doing your action surge?

02:02:30.288 --> 02:02:31.814
TALIESIN: I'm taking my action surge.

02:02:31.814 --> 02:02:35.576
MATT: Okay, so you use your action surge, and
that's it for this round. You use your first round

02:02:35.576 --> 02:02:38.026
to reload Bad News and place it back up on top.

02:02:38.026 --> 02:02:39.568
TALIESIN: Come on.

02:02:39.568 --> 02:02:41.567
MATT: Another head shot, you said?

02:02:41.567 --> 02:02:56.765
TALIESIN: Yeah. Oh! 19! That's much better. Plus
12, that's 32 to hit. And that's 15 points of

02:02:56.765 --> 02:03:01.406
damage, and head shot means he's got disadvantage
on all attacks for the next round.

02:03:01.406 --> 02:03:12.036
MATT: Okay, good to know. So I'm going to go ahead
and roll. All right, so. (gunshot) From the impact

02:03:12.036 --> 02:03:20.909
of the blast, you see the shot ricochet off of
Rimefang's face. The impact sends a couple pieces

02:03:20.909 --> 02:03:25.009
of white dragon scale shooting off into the
darkness, and the head (grunts) rears from the

02:03:25.009 --> 02:03:32.195
impact, shakes, seemingly loosely shaken by the
impact of the blast. The blowback from the gun

02:03:32.195 --> 02:03:39.007
actually sends a large crack through the physical
body of the ice warrior ahead of you, and it

02:03:39.007 --> 02:03:43.166
collapses into a pile of ice on the ground in
front of you.

02:03:43.166 --> 02:03:47.262
TALIESIN: I feel a little guilty about that. I
feel very guilty about that.

02:03:47.262 --> 02:03:50.044
MATT: You get the feeling that whatever was there
probably has not been alive

02:03:50.044 --> 02:03:51.608
for quite a while.

02:03:51.608 --> 02:03:52.857
TALIESIN: Okay, I feel a little better.

02:03:52.857 --> 02:03:55.057
MATT: Frozen solid. It breaks like the T-1000.

02:03:55.057 --> 02:03:57.150
TALIESIN: And he was the most useful he's ever
been.

02:03:57.150 --> 02:03:59.562
MATT: That ends Percy's turn. We're up at Vex.

02:03:59.562 --> 02:04:07.997
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to cast Lightning Arrow,
and I'm going to attack through my Blazing Bow.

02:04:07.997 --> 02:04:09.448
MATT: All righty.

02:04:09.448 --> 02:04:20.449
LAURA: Okay. Oh, that's good! That is a 25?

02:04:20.449 --> 02:04:24.683
MATT: 25? 25 does hit, yes.

02:04:24.683 --> 02:04:30.090
LAURA: Okay, so that is 4d8 of lightning damage.

02:04:30.090 --> 02:04:34.858
MATT: All right. Saving throw for half? Or just
take it?

02:04:34.858 --> 02:04:36.940
LAURA: Saving throw for half, yes.

02:04:36.940 --> 02:04:39.552
MATT: That's a natural 20 on its saving throw, so
it takes half damage.

02:04:39.552 --> 02:04:43.329
FELICIA: That's some stink-eye.

02:04:43.329 --> 02:04:46.716
MATT: Hey, better on a saving throw than on an
attack.

02:04:46.716 --> 02:05:09.675
LAURA: 13 plus six is 19, 20, so ten. Plus regular
damage, right? For my regular. 19. I know. 11 plus

02:05:09.675 --> 02:05:24.190
ten is 21, plus Hunter's Mark is four. And then
plus my Blazing Bow, which adds another ten. Where

02:05:24.190 --> 02:05:30.540
did that land? Shit, balls! I'm so aggressive
right now! I'm going to roll a different one! Oh

02:05:30.540 --> 02:05:38.261
my god. That looks like a one. Oh wow. Two ones.
That's great.

02:05:38.261 --> 02:05:42.952
MATT: So as you pull back your arrow, the actual
shaft begins to spark with bluish energy as you

02:05:42.952 --> 02:05:46.866
release it. The arrow transforms (energy noises)
into an arcing bolt of electrical energy. It

02:05:46.866 --> 02:05:51.306
impacts and courses through the upper torso of the
dragon, as it's (grunts) still trying to shake off

02:05:51.306 --> 02:05:58.558
the damage it took from Percy's attack. It manages
to push off most of the impact, but still takes

02:05:58.558 --> 02:06:02.428
damage from it. There's also a burst of fire from
the impact, as well, you can see a bit of flame

02:06:02.428 --> 02:06:05.329
trickle up the side of his body and it eventually
goes out from the cold in the air.

02:06:05.329 --> 02:06:06.927
LAURA: That was one attack.

02:06:06.927 --> 02:06:08.058
MATT: Yes.

02:06:08.058 --> 02:06:09.232
LAURA: Okay.

02:06:09.232 --> 02:06:11.658
MATT: But was the spell an action?

02:06:11.658 --> 02:06:14.315
LAURA: The Lightning Arrow is a bonus.

02:06:14.315 --> 02:06:20.025
MATT: Oh, okay. So it makes your next attack do
that. Right. Gotcha. So you have one more attack.

02:06:20.025 --> 02:06:25.199
LAURA: So I am going to send Trinket. Where is
he?

02:06:25.199 --> 02:06:27.565
MATT: Trinket's over here with the giants guarding
him.

02:06:27.565 --> 02:06:30.451
LAURA: Dear lord. Can Trinket run around and
attack his butt?

02:06:30.451 --> 02:06:33.094
MATT: It's actually up on top of a 15-foot
platform.

02:06:33.094 --> 02:06:35.526
LAURA: Oh, so Trinket can't do shit right now.

02:06:35.526 --> 02:06:37.353
MATT: Not right now, but Trinket can move if you
like.

02:06:37.353 --> 02:06:39.529
LAURA: Trinket's going to move, and I'm going to
attack again, can I do that?

02:06:39.529 --> 02:06:40.782
MATT: Yeah, you can do that.

02:06:40.782 --> 02:06:42.903
LAURA: We want to spread out.

02:06:42.903 --> 02:06:46.905
MATT: That's as far as Trinket get can get,
there.

02:06:46.905 --> 02:06:48.989
LAURA: Can I attack again?

02:06:48.989 --> 02:06:50.204
MATT: You can, yeah.

02:06:50.204 --> 02:06:58.034
LAURA: All right, I'll hit him again. Okay, just a
regular attack through the bow.

02:06:58.034 --> 02:07:00.720
MATT: Yep. This is your second use of it, though;
you're done with it.

02:07:00.720 --> 02:07:03.983
LAURA: Yes. 17.

02:07:03.983 --> 02:07:08.670
MATT: 17. As you fire the arrow, it takes its wing
and (whoosh) batters it out of the way, and the arrow

02:07:08.670 --> 02:07:13.147
shatters in mid air. You see a burst of fire as it
does nothing.

02:07:13.147 --> 02:07:16.550
LAURA: It was a 25 that hit before. What was the
first attack that hit?

02:07:16.550 --> 02:07:19.981
TALIESIN: I was in the 30s.

02:07:19.981 --> 02:07:23.348
MATT: So that ends your turn, Vex. Do you want to
move, or do you want to stay right there?

02:07:23.348 --> 02:07:27.387
LAURA: Can I stealth?

02:07:27.387 --> 02:07:30.027
MATT: (laughs) No, that's a hide action, I think.

02:07:30.027 --> 02:07:33.636
LAURA: Then I'm going to move along the wall
further. Yeah, like that.

02:07:33.636 --> 02:07:42.667
MATT: That ends your turn. Rimefang, now, shaking
off the frustration, looks around the room, lifts

02:07:42.667 --> 02:07:49.814
up on its back hind legs, spreads its wings, and
just gives this large roar. (roars) The entire

02:07:49.814 --> 02:07:54.625
room shakes, and you see pieces of ice and rock
begin to start falling from the ceiling.

02:07:54.625 --> 02:08:14.236
Everybody, go ahead and make a wisdom saving
throw. Everybody. One giant is fine. All right,

02:08:14.236 --> 02:08:18.824
starting with Percy.

02:08:18.824 --> 02:08:20.039
TALIESIN: 12.

02:08:20.039 --> 02:08:20.923
MATT: 12.

02:08:20.923 --> 02:08:22.012
FELICIA: 15.

02:08:22.012 --> 02:08:23.853
SAM: Natural 20, but it becomes 18.

02:08:23.853 --> 02:08:25.007
MATT: Okay.

02:08:25.007 --> 02:08:26.443
FELICIA: Because you're not wise.

02:08:26.443 --> 02:08:27.942
MARY: 21.

02:08:27.942 --> 02:08:30.300
MATT: All right.

02:08:30.300 --> 02:08:32.336
LAURA: Ten.

02:08:32.336 --> 02:08:34.237
MATT: Grog?

02:08:34.237 --> 02:08:35.591
TRAVIS: Nine?

02:08:35.591 --> 02:08:37.872
MATT: That's rough.

02:08:37.872 --> 02:08:39.213
TRAVIS: Very wise.

02:08:39.213 --> 02:08:42.450
SAM: Oh, lots of red circles.

02:08:42.450 --> 02:08:51.047
MATT: All right, so. The sheer amount of presence
that this dragon permeates sends a shiver of fear

02:08:51.047 --> 02:08:59.073
down your spine. Vex, Percy, Grog, and one of the
giants are currently frightened of the dragon.

02:08:59.073 --> 02:09:04.031
While you are frightened, you have disadvantage on
ability checks and attack rolls, and you cannot

02:09:04.031 --> 02:09:06.170
willingly move closer to the dragon.

02:09:06.170 --> 02:09:08.509
LAURA: Is Trinket frightened?

02:09:08.509 --> 02:09:12.340
MATT: Roll for Trinket.

02:09:12.340 --> 02:09:25.504
LAURA: Okay. Come on, Trinket. No! He's probably
pretty frightened. Oh, does that count as

02:09:25.504 --> 02:09:27.056
intimidation?

02:09:27.056 --> 02:09:31.541
MATT: No, it's a wisdom saving throw. So it's
whatever his wisdom bonus is.

02:09:31.541 --> 02:09:33.451
LAURA: He rolled an eight, so I'm guessing he's
pretty scared.

02:09:33.451 --> 02:09:38.158
MATT: Probably scared. Trinket, all of a sudden
also (scared bear noises) backs up a little bit

02:09:38.158 --> 02:09:41.556
and is looking equally frightened, especially
seeing you scared. Trinket feels a moment of fear

02:09:41.556 --> 02:09:42.464
there.

02:09:42.464 --> 02:09:45.386
LAURA: You've still got a really big dick!

02:09:45.386 --> 02:09:47.247
FELICIA: What?

02:09:47.247 --> 02:09:49.397
LAURA: I'm just telling him to encourage him.

02:09:49.397 --> 02:09:52.113
TRAVIS: I missed something.

02:09:52.113 --> 02:09:55.651
SAM: Not the dragon. Although, probably the dragon
too.

02:09:55.651 --> 02:10:05.148
MATT: Rimefang then (whoosh) flies up into the air
for a minute. And then swoops over and lands over

02:10:05.148 --> 02:10:10.296
on this side, and that's going to end its turn.
That brings us to Grog.

02:10:10.296 --> 02:10:12.784
TRAVIS: I got to break it, right?

02:10:12.784 --> 02:10:14.408
MATT: Yeah, you're scared.

02:10:14.408 --> 02:10:22.275
TRAVIS: Rage? I look over my shoulder, terrified,
at the other one that's scared, and I say, repeat

02:10:22.275 --> 02:10:25.187
after me, lads. I would like to rage.

02:10:25.187 --> 02:10:33.428
MATT: You reach into your inner self, and suddenly
you realize this is it. You know dragons, you've

02:10:33.428 --> 02:10:37.427
fought dragons in the past, you've killed dragons
in the past, and you know dragons have been

02:10:37.427 --> 02:10:41.871
responsible for hurting some of your friends and
their families, and through that, that anger just

02:10:41.871 --> 02:10:45.254
billows up from inside, and that fear shakes
from your body.

02:10:45.254 --> 02:10:48.586
TRAVIS: I want to kill a dragon like my friend
Pike did.

02:10:48.586 --> 02:10:51.994
MATT: You're now in a rage. You shake the fear
effect, and you can take the rest of your turn as

02:10:51.994 --> 02:10:53.448
you see fit.

02:10:53.448 --> 02:11:00.449
TRAVIS: (battle cry) I would like to run over that
direction.

02:11:00.449 --> 02:11:02.351
SAM: Oh, you're running away from it?

02:11:02.351 --> 02:11:05.232
MATT: You rage-ran.

02:11:05.232 --> 02:11:09.988
TRAVIS: I rage-ran. Can I attack?

02:11:09.988 --> 02:11:13.026
MATT: You're currently hiding behind a 15-foot
platform.

02:11:13.026 --> 02:11:14.508
TRAVIS: So I can't see beyond it?

02:11:14.508 --> 02:11:18.813
MATT: You're literally hiding from the dragon
right now. Cool. All right, that ends your turn?

02:11:18.813 --> 02:11:20.325
Zahra, you're up.

02:11:20.325 --> 02:11:23.151
MARY: All right, how far away is it from me?

02:11:23.151 --> 02:11:25.918
MATT: It is currently 30 feet from you.

02:11:25.918 --> 02:11:27.474
MARY: All right.

02:11:27.474 --> 02:11:35.244
MATT: Real fast. Grog, make a dexterity saving
throw.

02:11:35.244 --> 02:11:37.736
TRAVIS: 13?

02:11:37.736 --> 02:11:39.414
MATT: 13?

02:11:39.414 --> 02:11:43.354
LAURA: What was that for?

02:11:43.354 --> 02:11:49.925
MATT: As you're running through, all of a sudden
the floor gives out from underneath you, and you

02:11:49.925 --> 02:11:55.073
roll off to the side. You almost fall in, catching
yourself, you slide down into a pit, but manage to

02:11:55.073 --> 02:11:58.335
get your handhold on a piece of stone that's
jutting out of the rock. Pull yourself up.

02:11:58.335 --> 02:12:03.832
Underneath where you were in the ground is a
cracked piece of ice: a pit in the ground.

02:12:03.832 --> 02:12:05.402
LAURA: Seriously?

02:12:05.402 --> 02:12:09.814
MATT: But you're fine. You get back up to your
feet. That could've been really bad. It's about 15

02:12:09.814 --> 02:12:12.200
feet down into these jagged shards of ice.

02:12:12.200 --> 02:12:15.653
LAURA: My passive perception is 21. Just for
future reference.

02:12:15.653 --> 02:12:20.217
MATT: Good to know. You also have no light source.
You're at the far back in the darkness. Actually,

02:12:20.217 --> 02:12:22.406
you have Grog around you right now.

02:12:22.406 --> 02:12:24.916
MARY: And I still have Light cast.

02:12:24.916 --> 02:12:28.364
MATT: Yeah, so you're fine. All right. That brings
us to Zahra, once again.

02:12:28.364 --> 02:12:34.094
MARY: I cast my bonus Hex on this beautiful
beast.

02:12:34.094 --> 02:12:36.258
MATT: It is now Hexed, as well.

02:12:36.258 --> 02:12:38.905
SAM: What's that do? What's that?

02:12:38.905 --> 02:12:41.575
MARY: I get extra damage.

02:12:41.575 --> 02:12:46.325
TRAVIS: You sexy tailed bastard.

02:12:46.325 --> 02:12:56.211
MARY: I take my dark dragon staff, and as this
moon orb begins to glow, I cast Witch Bolt-- is

02:12:56.211 --> 02:13:04.313
that it?-- yes! Witch Bolt upon it! Infused with
my own internal moon fire.

02:13:04.313 --> 02:13:08.128
MATT: All right. Do you have to roll to hit on
that one?

02:13:08.128 --> 02:13:12.800
MARY: Witch Bolt? Yeah, what do I do? It's plus
11. 5d12 plus two.

02:13:12.800 --> 02:13:17.994
LAURA: Yeah, so roll and then add 11.

02:13:17.994 --> 02:13:19.238
MARY: 13.

02:13:19.238 --> 02:13:20.805
LAURA: Oh, that's good.

02:13:20.805 --> 02:13:24.350
MARY: 24, plus two damage to all spells cast, so
26?

02:13:24.350 --> 02:13:25.998
LAURA: No, that's damage.

02:13:25.998 --> 02:13:27.289
MARY: Oh, sorry, 24.

02:13:27.289 --> 02:13:31.314
MATT: All right, so Witch Bolt does hit. Go ahead
and roll damage for that.

02:13:31.314 --> 02:13:40.154
MARY: So 5d12. Five times. All right. Do math for
me, somebody. What is that? That's a three.

02:13:40.154 --> 02:13:41.901
TRAVIS: Three plus the two, so that's five.

02:13:41.901 --> 02:13:44.251
LAURA: You do it all and then add the two.

02:13:44.251 --> 02:13:45.996
TRAVIS: Oh, gotcha. Seven.

02:13:45.996 --> 02:13:47.624
MARY: That's four.

02:13:47.624 --> 02:13:56.434
TRAVIS: Yeah. Plus four. 19. 26. 38.

02:13:56.434 --> 02:13:57.819
MARY: One more?

02:13:57.819 --> 02:13:59.512
LAURA: No, that's all five.

02:13:59.512 --> 02:14:02.090
MATT: Five, and you add 1d6 to that because of
your Hex.

02:14:02.090 --> 02:14:05.176
LAURA: Plus two, so 38 is 40.

02:14:05.176 --> 02:14:07.640
MARY: One.

02:14:07.640 --> 02:14:09.317
MATT: Okay. So 41 points.

02:14:09.317 --> 02:14:10.557
MARY: Yeah.

02:14:10.557 --> 02:14:14.022
LAURA: Plus anything else? Wait, plus two damage
to all-- oh, but that's already--

02:14:14.022 --> 02:14:15.127
TRAVIS: That's already there.

02:14:15.127 --> 02:14:19.697
MATT: Okay, so. After you Hex it, you can see the
shadows around the dragon begin to form and

02:14:19.697 --> 02:14:25.806
coalesce around its torso, and as it looks around,
these small demonic faces that cackle as bits of

02:14:25.806 --> 02:14:30.889
moonlight begin to pierce through these grins
chokehold around its neck, and as it tries to

02:14:30.889 --> 02:14:38.151
shake it off, you bring your staff forward, and
this bolt of bluish-green electrical energy shakes

02:14:38.151 --> 02:14:44.623
out in what looks like a piercing arc of jagged
moonlight that strikes right into the center of

02:14:44.623 --> 02:14:49.191
the dragon's chest. As it does, the dragon's
nearly pushed off its feet for a second, gathers

02:14:49.191 --> 02:14:55.083
itself, and you can see that energy surrounds it
like magical shackles, it continues to keep its

02:14:55.083 --> 02:15:01.395
hold on the creature, as Witch Bolt does. All
right. Do you wish to move, or are you going to

02:15:01.395 --> 02:15:07.615
stay where you are? You can move 30 feet, six
squares.

02:15:07.615 --> 02:15:13.463
MARY: I'd like to go stand by the giants.

02:15:13.463 --> 02:15:15.138
TRAVIS: You're already there.

02:15:15.138 --> 02:15:19.019
MATT: Yeah, you're right here. It's hard for you
to see because that guy's in the way, but you're

02:15:19.019 --> 02:15:20.160
right there.

02:15:20.160 --> 02:15:27.998
MARY: All right. No, the other way. Blinding
players as we go. Where am I? I'm there? I'd like

02:15:27.998 --> 02:15:31.907
to move to the slight cover of the pedestal.

02:15:31.907 --> 02:15:36.713
MATT: You can get that far. All right, so there
you are. That ends your turn, Zahra. Scanlan,

02:15:36.713 --> 02:15:37.933
you're up.

02:15:37.933 --> 02:15:46.609
SAM: My eyes begin to change to a dark shade as I
turn my gaze to the dragon

02:15:46.609 --> 02:15:49.198
and cast Eyebite on him.

02:15:49.198 --> 02:15:50.927
TRAVIS: What? Cast what?

02:15:50.927 --> 02:15:52.490
SAM: Eyebite.

02:15:52.490 --> 02:15:54.406
MATT: All right. And how are you having that
affect him?

02:15:54.406 --> 02:15:58.032
SAM: I would like to sicken him. Give him a little
tummy-ache.

02:15:58.032 --> 02:16:01.530
TRAVIS: Is he going to do the twirls?

02:16:01.530 --> 02:16:03.493
MATT: Okay, we're going to do Eyebite here.

02:16:03.493 --> 02:16:05.735
SAM: Through my Hand Cone of Clarity!

02:16:05.735 --> 02:16:11.171
MATT: All right. So wisdom saving throw for the
dragon. Use my meteor dice one of the fans out

02:16:11.171 --> 02:16:13.675
there sent. All right, what's the DC on that now
total?

02:16:13.675 --> 02:16:15.527
SAM: It's 19.

02:16:15.527 --> 02:16:22.195
MATT: 19. That would fail. It's going to use its
legendary resistance to

02:16:22.195 --> 02:16:24.089
choose to succeed instead.

02:16:24.089 --> 02:16:26.245
SAM: It can just choose to succeed?!

02:16:26.245 --> 02:16:28.886
TRAVIS: How many times can it choose to do that?!

02:16:28.886 --> 02:16:31.172
MATT: Three times per day. Welcome to fighting a
dragon!

02:16:31.172 --> 02:16:33.692
SAM: What? But that was a cool spell!

02:16:33.692 --> 02:16:39.808
MATT: So as your eyes darken, the dragon's
currently surrounded by the Witch Bolt and the Hex

02:16:39.808 --> 02:16:43.445
on the creature. You darken your eyes, and you
look over and see the arcane energy taking your

02:16:43.445 --> 02:16:50.561
vision, its vision, combine it in midair. As you
do, it shakes its head and (roars) shouts. You

02:16:50.561 --> 02:16:53.620
instinctively pull back, and as you do, the spell
drifts away from you and you realize the

02:16:53.620 --> 02:16:55.003
incantation's lost.

02:16:55.003 --> 02:16:57.930
TRAVIS: Percy, use your badass motherfucker feat
to have it work.

02:16:57.930 --> 02:17:02.768
SAM: Okay, can I throw with a bonus action?

02:17:02.768 --> 02:17:05.868
MATT: What are you going to throw?

02:17:05.868 --> 02:17:07.298
SAM: A bag.

02:17:07.298 --> 02:17:11.488
MATT: No, that's probably more of an action, but
you can drop it as a bonus action.

02:17:11.488 --> 02:17:19.394
SAM: Got it. Then I will move a few steps away. I
can still move and stuff, right? I would like to

02:17:19.394 --> 02:17:24.609
move away from this group of
soon-to-be-blasted-with-dragon-fire people. Just a

02:17:24.609 --> 02:17:27.262
few yards away to my left.

02:17:27.262 --> 02:17:28.680
MATT: All right.

02:17:28.680 --> 02:17:40.913
SAM: That's fine, sure, that's great. And give
some inspiration to Lyra. I'll say, (singing) When

02:17:40.913 --> 02:17:46.242
the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie,
that's Aldor-e.

02:17:46.242 --> 02:17:48.758
(cheering)

02:17:48.758 --> 02:17:51.005
TRAVIS: Yeah, going deep.

02:17:51.005 --> 02:17:57.465
MATT: And suddenly, the fear that's getting close
to clutching your heart and giving you every

02:17:57.465 --> 02:18:01.702
instinct to run from this, you hear the name
Aldor, and you feel that surge of warmth fill your

02:18:01.702 --> 02:18:06.307
body, and the need to push on forward. Go ahead
and take a d10 inspiration dice to use in any roll

02:18:06.307 --> 02:18:07.358
you want.

02:18:07.358 --> 02:18:09.008
FELICIA: Oh my gosh, thank you so much. That's
beautiful.

02:18:09.008 --> 02:18:10.539
SAM: Well, I wrote it for you.

02:18:10.539 --> 02:18:16.848
MATT: All right. That ends your turn, Scanlan. Now
the giants go. This one is going to move to the

02:18:16.848 --> 02:18:21.076
side. It's deathly afraid of the dragon, it's
like, this is a bad idea, it's really regretting

02:18:21.076 --> 02:18:24.105
its decision. It's going to attempt to shake the
effect. And does so.

02:18:24.105 --> 02:18:26.599
(cheering)

02:18:26.599 --> 02:18:32.757
MATT: Shakes its fright. The other one is going to
step over you. As you're like, all of a sudden

02:18:32.757 --> 02:18:35.657
this foot goes (wham) in front of you, you're
like, (nervous sound).

02:18:35.657 --> 02:18:37.438
FELICIA: Oh my god, I got hit with his dick.

02:18:37.438 --> 02:18:39.282
(laughter)

02:18:39.282 --> 02:18:40.648
TRAVIS: What were their names? Ace and Base?

02:18:40.648 --> 02:18:43.930
SAM and MARY: Ace and Gary.

02:18:43.930 --> 02:18:47.427
MATT: The giant's going to move forward. It's
going to attempt to make two strikes with its

02:18:47.427 --> 02:18:58.045
greataxe. That's going to be a 17, that misses.
And a 16, that misses. (whooshing) Makes two

02:18:58.045 --> 02:19:01.501
strikes to the dragon, and it just dodges out of
the way. The second one, it reaches up with its

02:19:01.501 --> 02:19:05.831
claw and slaps, just parries its axe out of the
way and just glares at it, and you can see at that

02:19:05.831 --> 02:19:12.016
moment, the giant also itself is like (growls).
Ending their turn. Lyra, you're up.

02:19:12.016 --> 02:19:18.258
FELICIA: Oh, what? Finally me? All right. I am
going to get my big spell out. Now, can I target

02:19:18.258 --> 02:19:23.522
its wing and try to Disintegrate-- can I try to
cut its wing off?

02:19:23.522 --> 02:19:27.257
MATT: You know what, yeah, if you want to go ahead
and try that. It's going to be a disadvantage on

02:19:27.257 --> 02:19:28.524
the attack roll.

02:19:28.524 --> 02:19:29.889
FELICIA: What is that?

02:19:29.889 --> 02:19:31.627
TRAVIS: Roll it twice and you get the lower
number.

02:19:31.627 --> 02:19:33.220
MATT: But does Disintegrate have--

02:19:33.220 --> 02:19:34.448
FELICIA: It doesn't have a DC.

02:19:34.448 --> 02:19:36.349
MATT: Then it would have an advantage on the
saving throw.

02:19:36.349 --> 02:19:40.718
FELICIA: Oh, okay. No, I'm going to try to hit it.
It's my big gun, I don't want to be like, sorry.

02:19:40.718 --> 02:19:43.761
I'm like, I just did this and it looked amazing.

02:19:43.761 --> 02:19:47.338
SAM: Which one are you doing?

02:19:47.338 --> 02:19:56.276
FELICIA: I'm doing Disintegrate. And it's 10d6
plus a d10, plus 40. Right? It's not the best

02:19:56.276 --> 02:19:59.065
roll, guys. There's a lot of small numbers here.

02:19:59.065 --> 02:20:01.366
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's only got plus 40. It's a pretty
shrimpy hit.

02:20:01.366 --> 02:20:03.630
LAURA: Wait, plus 40?

02:20:03.630 --> 02:20:06.904
MATT: Yeah, it's 10d6 plus 40 force damage.

02:20:06.904 --> 02:20:08.762
TRAVIS: I need to get a wand.

02:20:08.762 --> 02:20:10.459
MATT: Disintegrate's nasty.

02:20:10.459 --> 02:20:12.090
FELICIA: 39.

02:20:12.090 --> 02:20:17.589
MATT: 39 plus 40? All right, that's 79 points of
damage. What's the DC? It's 17 on that for your

02:20:17.589 --> 02:20:18.648
spells?

02:20:18.648 --> 02:20:20.137
FELICIA: Yes.

02:20:20.137 --> 02:20:25.006
MATT: It does make its saving throw, so half
damage. But rounding up, that's 40 damage still.

02:20:25.006 --> 02:20:31.530
40 force damage to the dragon. As you, with the
swelling of energy that Scanlan gave you reminding

02:20:31.530 --> 02:20:36.676
you of Aldor, you release and once again that
sickeningly green beam of arcane energy just

02:20:36.676 --> 02:20:41.175
streaks out, hits the dragon, and with a burst of
arcane energy you can see part of its scales have

02:20:41.175 --> 02:20:46.579
withered, part of its wing is now tattered and
missing, and immediately the physical form of the

02:20:46.579 --> 02:20:48.609
dragon, it's reeling in pain.

02:20:48.609 --> 02:20:51.218
LAURA: So if we aim at that area that doesn't have
scales...

02:20:51.218 --> 02:20:53.756
MATT: You'll find out.

02:20:53.756 --> 02:20:56.970
MARY: But you've still got the Witch Bolt wrapping
around him, yeah?

02:20:56.970 --> 02:20:58.798
MATT: That is focused.

02:20:58.798 --> 02:21:08.949
FELICIA: I definitely want to move. I want to move
over there behind that-- over here. Yeah. So I'm a

02:21:08.949 --> 02:21:10.608
little less conspicuous.

02:21:10.608 --> 02:21:17.089
MATT: All righty. Cool. That will be the top of
the round. Percy, you're up.

02:21:17.089 --> 02:21:19.083
TALIESIN: Still no hand-grenade.

02:21:19.083 --> 02:21:23.613
MATT: No. The fear has shaken you, so you cannot
move closer to it, and you have disadvantage on

02:21:23.613 --> 02:21:24.873
attacks.

02:21:24.873 --> 02:21:26.663
TALIESIN: What do I do to shake the fear?

02:21:26.663 --> 02:21:30.396
MATT: At the end of your turn, you make a saving
throw to try and shake it. You can't move closer

02:21:30.396 --> 02:21:33.401
to it, but you can still attack it. You cannot
move closer to it, and your attacks have

02:21:33.401 --> 02:21:34.651
disadvantage.

02:21:34.651 --> 02:21:42.140
TALIESIN: Okay, I'm going to try and take a shot
at it with a standard shot for right now.

02:21:42.140 --> 02:21:49.900
MATT: Okay. So because you've shot, reloaded,
shot, reloaded. Go for it.

02:21:49.900 --> 02:21:56.666
TALIESIN: 17. Wait, and with disadvantage.

02:21:56.666 --> 02:22:00.264
FELICIA: Oh no. That's a great 20 you can't use.

02:22:00.264 --> 02:22:07.261
MATT: Yeah. So a total of 17? As you fire, it
would've hit, unfortunately it streaks through the

02:22:07.261 --> 02:22:13.860
portion of the wing that currently is left a
gaping hole thanks to the Disintegrate spell, the

02:22:13.860 --> 02:22:18.041
impact of the bullet itself blasting against the
back wall, sending chunks and shards of ice

02:22:18.041 --> 02:22:19.709
spilling off in the distance.

02:22:19.709 --> 02:22:24.542
TALIESIN: I would like to really quickly then go
into that little corner there for some cover.

02:22:24.542 --> 02:22:32.250
MATT: Okay. All right. Cool, so that ends your
turn. Vex, you're up next.

02:22:32.250 --> 02:22:35.306
TALIESIN: Oh, I didn't roll to shake off the
fear.

02:22:35.306 --> 02:22:38.118
MATT: Go ahead and make the save.

02:22:38.118 --> 02:22:39.420
TRAVIS: (singing) Shake it off.

02:22:39.420 --> 02:22:41.375
ALL: (singing) Shake it off!

02:22:41.375 --> 02:22:42.587
MATT: What'd you roll?

02:22:42.587 --> 02:22:43.648
TALIESIN: Five.

02:22:43.648 --> 02:22:48.999
MATT: Five, yeah. The fear is still clutching you
internally, like, "Shit, dragon, bad, dragon!"

02:22:48.999 --> 02:22:52.151
Vex.

02:22:52.151 --> 02:22:53.824
LAURA: Can I see him at all?

02:22:53.824 --> 02:22:58.278
MATT: Right now? No. You can see parts of the
wings fluttering over, but you don't have a very

02:22:58.278 --> 02:22:59.520
good visual on it.

02:22:59.520 --> 02:23:00.544
LAURA: And he's pretty far away?

02:23:00.544 --> 02:23:02.204
MATT: He's decent distance, yeah.

02:23:02.204 --> 02:23:06.550
LAURA: If I just try to (bowstring noise) up?

02:23:06.550 --> 02:23:11.008
MATT: You can try to. It has three-quarters cover,
so it gets a plus five to its armor class.

02:23:11.008 --> 02:23:18.706
LAURA: And I'm at disadvantage. Does it seem like
if I cast something that would do mass damage,

02:23:18.706 --> 02:23:23.613
would the giant then not want to attack with us
anymore?

02:23:23.613 --> 02:23:26.268
MATT: That's a risk you'd have to take.

02:23:26.268 --> 02:23:29.299
TRAVIS: Drop some stank on that dragon.

02:23:29.299 --> 02:23:40.452
LAURA: I'm scared to hit the giant with it.
Because I want to do Conjure Barrage, but I'm

02:23:40.452 --> 02:23:42.212
afraid of the giant.

02:23:42.212 --> 02:23:44.844
FELICIA: Well, if you do damage to him, the spell
breaks.

02:23:44.844 --> 02:23:46.498
LAURA: Exactly. So that would be bad.

02:23:46.498 --> 02:23:49.380
SAM: But he's not fighting for us because of a
spell right now. We convinced him.

02:23:49.380 --> 02:23:50.912
FELICIA and TALIESIN: Well.

02:23:50.912 --> 02:23:52.622
LAURA: Potentially.

02:23:52.622 --> 02:23:56.911
TRAVIS: Look at the poker face on that DM. Giving
up nothing. Giving up nothing!

02:23:56.911 --> 02:23:59.203
FELICIA: Stone-faced.

02:23:59.203 --> 02:24:01.000
LAURA: Should I try it?

02:24:01.000 --> 02:24:04.687
TALIESIN: I don't know. What do I know?

02:24:04.687 --> 02:24:11.347
MARY: If we damage it, this spell that I've been
talking to him with goes (poof).

02:24:11.347 --> 02:24:14.958
LAURA: All right, then I'm going to try to hit the
dragon with a regular attack. I'm not going to do

02:24:14.958 --> 02:24:15.884
Conjure Barrage.

02:24:15.884 --> 02:24:17.873
MATT: All right, so what's the first range
increment on your longbow?

02:24:17.873 --> 02:24:19.226
LAURA: It's 120.

02:24:19.226 --> 02:24:21.686
MATT: That's the first range increment? Yeah, it's
a longbow, yeah. So you're not at disadvantage

02:24:21.686 --> 02:24:26.500
from that shot. However, it does have
three-quarters cover. And given that

02:24:26.500 --> 02:24:27.643
circumstance--

02:24:27.643 --> 02:24:29.856
TALIESIN: Does she not have sharpshooter?

02:24:29.856 --> 02:24:37.157
LAURA: I don't. That's not the feat that I took. I
took read lips. I'm really good in populated

02:24:37.157 --> 02:24:38.618
areas.

02:24:38.618 --> 02:24:40.340
MATT: So go for it and roll for the attacks.

02:24:40.340 --> 02:24:45.134
LAURA: Okay, cool. Here we go! Yeah, no. Doesn't
hit.

02:24:45.134 --> 02:24:48.139
(laughter)

02:24:48.139 --> 02:24:50.208
FELICIA: We're going to die!

02:24:50.208 --> 02:24:53.940
MATT: You pull back and release the first arrow.
It actually just barely scrapes the top of the

02:24:53.940 --> 02:24:56.546
platform and shatters across the ice.

02:24:56.546 --> 02:24:58.465
MARY: Come on!

02:24:58.465 --> 02:25:01.513
LAURA: That's better! 27!

02:25:01.513 --> 02:25:05.261
MATT: 27, even with the three-quarters cover, does
hit! Go ahead and roll damage.

02:25:05.261 --> 02:25:07.220
(cheering)

02:25:07.220 --> 02:25:24.024
LAURA: Okay. What is that? 12, 13, 14! Plus a d6,
because I'm badass! Plus six! That's 19. That's

02:25:24.024 --> 02:25:28.146
not even close to 40, but it does something.

02:25:28.146 --> 02:25:33.356
MATT: It's still damage! So as you release the
arrow, it just misses the top of the platform, and

02:25:33.356 --> 02:25:38.190
you get just enough of an angle that it hits one
of the wings as it pulls it up, sticks into the

02:25:38.190 --> 02:25:41.603
part of its hand that crests the top of the wing.
It (growls)--

02:25:41.603 --> 02:25:43.062
LAURA: And I say, fuck you!

02:25:43.062 --> 02:25:47.918
MATT: Okay. And it echoes, "Fuck you, fuck you..."
Do you or Trinket wish to move?

02:25:47.918 --> 02:25:53.579
LAURA: We're as far away as we can be, and I can't
move any closer.

02:25:53.579 --> 02:25:58.304
MATT: That's true. So now you and Trinket both
make wisdom saving throws to try and shake the

02:25:58.304 --> 02:26:04.921
fear. Oh, and you're frightened, so actually, roll
again on the attack. Disadvantage on the attacks.

02:26:04.921 --> 02:26:10.619
Just roll again. You're frightened.

02:26:10.619 --> 02:26:24.560
LAURA: No, both of those sucked. The first one was
20. 20 was the first!

02:26:24.560 --> 02:26:28.801
MATT: So a total of 20 for the second roll?
Well, that would hit. Well no, it has

02:26:28.801 --> 02:26:30.647
three-quarters cover so it wouldn't,
unfortunately.

02:26:30.647 --> 02:26:32.666
LAURA: Matthew Mercer.

02:26:32.666 --> 02:26:37.560
MATT: You were frightened! It's part of the
effect. I had to remind myself that. So the arrow

02:26:37.560 --> 02:26:44.940
splinters off the top of the wing as it reaches
upward, and you still feel the fear clutching your

02:26:44.940 --> 02:26:46.474
physical self.

02:26:46.474 --> 02:26:47.819
LAURA: Now we try to shake it off.

02:26:47.819 --> 02:26:49.062
MATT: Now you try and shake it off.

02:26:49.062 --> 02:26:50.176
LAURA: (sings) I shake it off.

02:26:50.176 --> 02:26:51.592
MARY: (sings) Shake it off!

02:26:51.592 --> 02:26:53.370
MATT: First roll is for you.

02:26:53.370 --> 02:26:59.980
LAURA: I do not succeed. It's a three.

02:26:59.980 --> 02:27:01.901
MATT: That would be a no, sorry. For Trinket?

02:27:01.901 --> 02:27:08.438
LAURA: 20! Why did you say the first one was for
me? Why couldn't the second one be for me?

02:27:08.438 --> 02:27:12.496
MATT: Because that's how it works. So while you're
still scared, you look over and you see Trinket

02:27:12.496 --> 02:27:17.799
shakes it off. Trinket looks over his shoulder at
you and gives you a nod of like, I got this. Turns

02:27:17.799 --> 02:27:25.960
back to the dragon and gives a (roars) giant
grizzly-bear growl and shout at the dragon. Do you

02:27:25.960 --> 02:27:27.712
wish to move at all?

02:27:27.712 --> 02:27:29.042
LAURA: Where is he?

02:27:29.042 --> 02:27:29.908
MATT: Trinket's right here.

02:27:29.908 --> 02:27:34.050
LAURA: He's going to run up for the time being and
hide. Give me this.

02:27:34.050 --> 02:27:37.384
FELICIA: Hide? Why is everyone hiding?!

02:27:37.384 --> 02:27:41.021
LAURA: He's not hiding! He's going to run up to
this area so that he's got a better vantage point

02:27:41.021 --> 02:27:42.481
to run up for the next turn.

02:27:42.481 --> 02:27:45.223
MATT: That's about as far as Trinket can get right
there.

02:27:45.223 --> 02:27:47.202
LAURA: He can't get any further into this little
crevice?

02:27:47.202 --> 02:27:48.251
MATT: Unfortunately, no.

02:27:48.251 --> 02:27:49.920
LAURA: Can he run right here?

02:27:49.920 --> 02:27:53.276
MATT: Trinket could move here instead. That's as
far as Trinket could move on his movement.

02:27:53.276 --> 02:27:55.187
LAURA: That's not really protecting him, is it?

02:27:55.187 --> 02:27:58.225
MATT: No, but it's not over in a cluster of other
people.

02:27:58.225 --> 02:27:59.497
LAURA: All right.

02:27:59.497 --> 02:28:04.576
MATT: All right. Does that end your turn?
Rimefang, who currently has this giant in its

02:28:04.576 --> 02:28:14.455
face, angrily decides to instead, as a legendary
action at the end of your turn, actually, before

02:28:14.455 --> 02:28:20.884
it takes its turn as you've misfired and Trinket's
running along, it's going to go ahead and use one

02:28:20.884 --> 02:28:25.623
of its legendary actions to do a wing attack
against the giant in front of it.

02:28:25.623 --> 02:28:27.806
MARY: No, Derek!

02:28:27.806 --> 02:28:32.512
TRAVIS: (laughs) Derek. It's Gary.

02:28:32.512 --> 02:28:37.267
MARY: Gary. He told me telepathically that his
name is actually Derek.

02:28:37.267 --> 02:28:42.399
MATT: This is an interesting point. Remember, this
is a dragon. It's your favored enemy. So keep that in

02:28:42.399 --> 02:28:45.261
mind, you have an advantage on attacks against
it.

02:28:45.261 --> 02:28:49.950
LAURA: Do I? No, I don't. I looked it up today,
yo. I don't get shit on attacks for him because we

02:28:49.950 --> 02:28:54.706
transferred over from Pathfinder. All I can do is
talk to him.

02:28:54.706 --> 02:28:56.742
MATT: The chat keeps yelling that the favored
enemy--

02:28:56.742 --> 02:29:00.162
LAURA: Well, chat, I looked it up, and I don't
think I have advantage.

02:29:00.162 --> 02:29:03.091
MATT: That's true, chat. You're wrong.

02:29:03.091 --> 02:29:05.505
(shouting)

02:29:05.505 --> 02:29:10.883
LAURA: I literally texted Matt today and I was
super upset.

02:29:10.883 --> 02:29:13.841
ZAC: Did chat try to challenge the DM?

02:29:13.841 --> 02:29:15.068
MATT: Apparently.

02:29:15.068 --> 02:29:19.794
LAURA: Seriously, I thought I had it, too, and
then I looked it up. In fifth edition,

02:29:19.794 --> 02:29:21.476
I don't get that.

02:29:21.476 --> 02:29:24.553
MATT: As a favored enemy, she gets benefits, but
not specifically in battle. It's more about

02:29:24.553 --> 02:29:25.454
knowing--

02:29:25.454 --> 02:29:29.582
SAM: I appreciate the chat. Please, keep it
coming.

02:29:29.582 --> 02:29:33.539
MARY: Couldn't that inspire Vex in some way? Don't
you get an inspiration roll from the chat?

02:29:33.539 --> 02:29:34.790
MATT: Sorry.

02:29:34.790 --> 02:29:39.198
FELICIA: You know what's good is that it's a
different team next week, because we're all going

02:29:39.198 --> 02:29:40.288
to die.

02:29:40.288 --> 02:29:45.091
MARY: No! Lyra, you're our leader, come on!

02:29:45.091 --> 02:29:49.019
MATT: Sorry, chat. You're wrong. Tried to go with
you there, but you're wrong.

02:29:49.019 --> 02:29:51.961
LAURA: I shouldn't have even said anything, I
should've just gone with you. I'm an idiot.

02:29:51.961 --> 02:29:58.820
MATT: That's okay. No worries, but thank you for
being honest and wrong, chat. All right,

02:29:58.820 --> 02:30:03.733
nevertheless. It's going to do a wing attack
against the giant in front of it. The giant is

02:30:03.733 --> 02:30:14.513
trying to make a dexterity saving throw. Does not.
The giant is knocked prone from the wings (whoosh)

02:30:14.513 --> 02:30:20.123
buffeting it with wind as it begins to take off,
knocking the giant back and dealing 13 points of

02:30:20.123 --> 02:30:30.788
bludgeoning damage. The dragon then picks up and
lands right there. And rears back its head

02:30:30.788 --> 02:30:39.699
(snarling roar) and unleashes a torrent of
freezing cold dragon's breath. A 60-foot cone.

02:30:39.699 --> 02:30:45.320
It's going to hit the giant, it's going to hit
Lyra, and it's going to hit Percy.

02:30:45.320 --> 02:30:47.091
TALIESIN: Do I not have some cover?

02:30:47.091 --> 02:30:53.737
MATT: Not against dragon's breath, unfortunately.
So I need both of you guys to go ahead and make a

02:30:53.737 --> 02:31:01.334
constitution saving throw from the sheer freezing
cold.

02:31:01.334 --> 02:31:03.180
FELICIA: Oh no. That didn't go well for me.

02:31:03.180 --> 02:31:04.436
SAM: Plus three.

02:31:04.436 --> 02:31:08.648
FELICIA: Oh, that's true. No, that's damage.

02:31:08.648 --> 02:31:10.148
TALIESIN: 20.

02:31:10.148 --> 02:31:14.651
SAM: Wait. She gets my inspiration on this throw.

02:31:14.651 --> 02:31:16.216
MATT: If she chooses to use it, yes.

02:31:16.216 --> 02:31:17.694
FELICIA: Yes, I definitely want to use it.

02:31:17.694 --> 02:31:19.495
MATT: So add a d10 to what you rolled.

02:31:19.495 --> 02:31:22.980
FELICIA: Ten! Thank god, because that's a 21.

02:31:22.980 --> 02:31:28.925
MATT: 21, okay. All right, so both of you take
half of the 54 damage it would've dealt.

02:31:28.925 --> 02:31:32.565
LAURA: 54 damage?

02:31:32.565 --> 02:31:39.421
MATT: You both take 27 points of cold damage. The
giant that had been partially disintegrated before

02:31:39.421 --> 02:31:45.974
by Lyra now takes the brunt of the frozen damage,
and you can now see the ice begins to build up

02:31:45.974 --> 02:31:55.618
around it as it (gurgling) gurgles as its life's
blood is now stilled. While frozen in place, the

02:31:55.618 --> 02:32:00.652
ice around its physical form holding it there as a
statue of death. The giant is no more.

02:32:00.652 --> 02:32:02.114
TRAVIS and MARY: No!

02:32:02.114 --> 02:32:03.554
LAURA: What? No!

02:32:03.554 --> 02:32:08.501
SAM: Grog, go get his axe! It's really big!

02:32:08.501 --> 02:32:13.263
LAURA: Is it too big to carry? He's got a flaming
axe right now.

02:32:13.263 --> 02:32:16.151
MATT: All right, and that ends Rimefang's turn.
Grog, you're up.

02:32:16.151 --> 02:32:21.695
TRAVIS: I would like to race back from whence I
came to attack his right flank, if I could.

02:32:21.695 --> 02:32:26.014
MATT: You could get there. You will have to make--
actually, no, you can move through there without

02:32:26.014 --> 02:32:26.990
an issue.

02:32:26.990 --> 02:32:28.760
TRAVIS: Also, I have darkvision up to 60 feet.

02:32:28.760 --> 02:32:33.125
MATT: You rush up towards the dragon.

02:32:33.125 --> 02:32:39.961
TRAVIS: I'd like to take my Firebrand Warhammer
and activate it. Ignite it.

02:32:39.961 --> 02:32:42.955
MATT: As a bonus action. Well, it's already been
ignited, you've had it flaming this whole time.

02:32:42.955 --> 02:32:47.111
TRAVIS: Oh, beautiful, yeah. It's like a torch,
which means I can see even better. I'd like to go

02:32:47.111 --> 02:32:50.895
into a frenzied rage and start swinging away.

02:32:50.895 --> 02:32:53.656
MATT: All right, so three attacks on the big old
dragon.

02:32:53.656 --> 02:32:55.102
TRAVIS: 19.

02:32:55.102 --> 02:32:56.558
MATT: 19 does hit.

02:32:56.558 --> 02:32:58.136
TRAVIS: Beautiful. 25.

02:32:58.136 --> 02:32:59.526
MATT: Does hit.

02:32:59.526 --> 02:33:01.385
TRAVIS: And 23.

02:33:01.385 --> 02:33:03.219
MATT: All three hit. Go ahead and roll damage.

02:33:03.219 --> 02:33:11.005
LAURA: Okay, so this is the new thing. d10 plus
five plus eight. Plus another--

02:33:11.005 --> 02:33:12.268
TRAVIS: d10?

02:33:12.268 --> 02:33:13.702
LAURA: Yeah.

02:33:13.702 --> 02:33:18.097
MATT: You're hitting with a weapon that's not as
big as your greataxe, but you do an additional 1d6

02:33:18.097 --> 02:33:19.514
fire damage when you hit.

02:33:19.514 --> 02:33:22.244
TRAVIS: Holy shit. Ah!

02:33:22.244 --> 02:33:26.113
MATT: d10 and a d6 together three times. Plus
eight to each.

02:33:26.113 --> 02:33:27.739
TRAVIS: Three d10s?

02:33:27.739 --> 02:33:29.746
LAURA: Yes. Plus 3d6.

02:33:29.746 --> 02:33:31.378
MATT: Plus eight to what you roll on both of
those.

02:33:31.378 --> 02:33:33.277
TRAVIS: You threw a bunch of numbers at me.

02:33:33.277 --> 02:33:36.317
MATT: All right, so a d10 and a d6 plus eight.

02:33:36.317 --> 02:33:41.075
TRAVIS: 19.

02:33:41.075 --> 02:33:42.245
MATT: 19 damage.

02:33:42.245 --> 02:33:47.735
TRAVIS: Do I do that three times? Oh, wow. 19, and
that's 12.

02:33:47.735 --> 02:33:49.293
MATT: 12, all right.

02:33:49.293 --> 02:33:51.455
TRAVIS: 12 and then, help me numbers, that's--

02:33:51.455 --> 02:33:54.951
LAURA: Oh, that's good, 16. Plus? Ooh. 21.

02:33:54.951 --> 02:34:00.914
MATT: Nice. (whack) As you bring the warhammer
down, it smacks the side of the dragon, the flames

02:34:00.914 --> 02:34:05.018
all of a sudden burst off of it from the impact,
you can see as you pull back, the white scales are

02:34:05.018 --> 02:34:10.180
burned and charred and blackened behind from the
first attack. You bring it back, slam again on the

02:34:10.180 --> 02:34:15.744
second part. As you do, the dragon roars
out in pain, the actual force of the impact almost

02:34:15.744 --> 02:34:20.213
sending it to catch itself on the other side of
its body. Its head swings around to look at

02:34:20.213 --> 02:34:24.937
whoever's slamming it in the side as you bring the
hammer back, swing underneath and then hit it from

02:34:24.937 --> 02:34:28.304
underneath the bottom of its torso, right where
its ribs would be, with a (crunch) crack sound.

02:34:28.304 --> 02:34:32.958
You hit it a third time, leaving a second giant
charred mark where you made impact.

02:34:32.958 --> 02:34:34.370
TRAVIS: Yes!

02:34:34.370 --> 02:34:37.754
MATT: That'll end your turn. Zahra, you're up.

02:34:37.754 --> 02:34:40.691
MARY: All right, I've still got Witch Bolt.

02:34:40.691 --> 02:34:41.693
MATT: You do.

02:34:41.693 --> 02:34:43.043
MARY: And it's still going, yes?

02:34:43.043 --> 02:34:47.461
MATT: You don't have to roll to attack again. You
just use your action.

02:34:47.461 --> 02:34:53.017
MARY: I just fucking keep going with the fucking
Witch Bolt. Can I use a cantrip, or will that

02:34:53.017 --> 02:34:54.125
dispel the Witch Bolt?

02:34:54.125 --> 02:34:58.381
MATT: No, because most cantrips take an action. So
you would not be able to. The Witch Bolt is your

02:34:58.381 --> 02:35:07.260
action. Almost all cantrips are actions to use
them, so you'd be either able to use your action

02:35:07.260 --> 02:35:09.401
and the Witch Bolt, or use the cantrip. Your
choice.

02:35:09.401 --> 02:35:12.141
MARY: No, no, I'm going to stick with Witch Bolt.
I'm very happy with this.

02:35:12.141 --> 02:35:19.158
MATT: So you focus yet again, your eyes still
glowing in that strange, midnight moon color with

02:35:19.158 --> 02:35:23.620
this black smoke that's framing the side of it.
You take your staff and force your will through it

02:35:23.620 --> 02:35:28.668
once again. That connection between you and the
dragon and that weird swirling greenish-blue

02:35:28.668 --> 02:35:31.815
energy that surrounds the dragon connects with
your staff. And as it does, it sends another bolt

02:35:31.815 --> 02:35:37.139
of otherworldly energy careening into the side of
the dragon. Go ahead and roll damage.

02:35:37.139 --> 02:35:41.936
LAURA: I watch her with my mouth agape.

02:35:41.936 --> 02:35:46.042
TRAVIS: d12.

02:35:46.042 --> 02:35:47.692
LAURA: Five times.

02:35:47.692 --> 02:35:49.433
TRAVIS: We got you.

02:35:49.433 --> 02:35:53.681
MARY: 12. 17.

02:35:53.681 --> 02:35:56.619
TRAVIS: 19.

02:35:56.619 --> 02:35:59.836
LAURA and TRAVIS: Ooh, 30.

02:35:59.836 --> 02:36:02.930
LAURA and MARY: 37.

02:36:02.930 --> 02:36:04.197
LAURA: And one more.

02:36:04.197 --> 02:36:05.902
TRAVIS: No, that's five.

02:36:05.902 --> 02:36:08.269
MATT: That was five. Then you roll a 1d6 on top of
that.

02:36:08.269 --> 02:36:10.068
MARY: Plus two on that.

02:36:10.068 --> 02:36:13.237
MATT: All right, so 38, then a d6 from your Hex.

02:36:13.237 --> 02:36:14.521
MARY: Six.

02:36:14.521 --> 02:36:17.371
MATT: So 44 points of damage.

02:36:17.371 --> 02:36:18.585
LAURA: Nice!

02:36:18.585 --> 02:36:24.536
MATT: As it once again, a giant piece of the
dragon's scales shatter off the side, like you're

02:36:24.536 --> 02:36:30.572
cracking into the center of an icy, mountainous
cragside. It's starting to show a little bit of

02:36:30.572 --> 02:36:36.381
damage. You guys are definitely taking this battle
head-on pretty well so far.

02:36:36.381 --> 02:36:38.151
TRAVIS: I don't like the way he said that.

02:36:38.151 --> 02:36:40.511
MATT: You're going to stay where you are, or are
you going to move?

02:36:40.511 --> 02:36:42.666
MARY: How close am I to it?

02:36:42.666 --> 02:36:45.831
MATT: You're currently 20 feet away from the
dragon. 15 is between the two of you.

02:36:45.831 --> 02:36:50.548
MARY: All right. I stay within 30 feet of it.

02:36:50.548 --> 02:36:53.401
MATT: All right, so you want to move this way?

02:36:53.401 --> 02:37:01.934
MARY: I want to get up to the heavens. Oh, sorry.
I'm going to actually, you know what? I'm going to

02:37:01.934 --> 02:37:04.391
move three feet backwards, that's it.

02:37:04.391 --> 02:37:08.503
MATT: Okay, so you just step back? Okay. There you
go. All right. That ends Zahra's turn. Scanlan,

02:37:08.503 --> 02:37:09.632
you're up.

02:37:09.632 --> 02:37:10.962
SAM: How close am I?

02:37:10.962 --> 02:37:13.474
MATT: You are currently about 20 feet away from
the dragon.

02:37:13.474 --> 02:37:23.548
SAM: All right. Yes. Hi. Scanlan here. I'll do,
(singing) It's Bigby's Hand! Bigby's Hand.

02:37:23.548 --> 02:37:27.516
Shamone. I'll just punch him in his dragon face.

02:37:27.516 --> 02:37:33.289
MATT: (laughs) Okay. You do a quick little hand
gesture, hum to yourself the arcane ritual, and a

02:37:33.289 --> 02:37:41.083
very large, mystical see-through replica of your
fist appears in the air above you and goes

02:37:41.083 --> 02:37:50.644
spinning off in the air in an arc. Straight up
Popeye-punching towards the dragon. (laughs) Let's

02:37:50.644 --> 02:37:53.668
go ahead, and Bigby-- what do you have to roll for
that?

02:37:53.668 --> 02:37:56.379
SAM: Oh, I have to roll for that?

02:37:56.379 --> 02:38:00.804
MATT: Let me see what the effect is on that,
remind myself real fast. Bigby's Hand. All right,

02:38:00.804 --> 02:38:09.439
so it's an AC of 20. Or no, that's the hand, all
right. Clenched fist, cool. So make a melee spell

02:38:09.439 --> 02:38:12.285
attack. So roll a d20 and then add your spell
attack modifier.

02:38:12.285 --> 02:38:15.720
SAM: That's the spell attack bonus thing? Okay.
19.

02:38:15.720 --> 02:38:22.155
MATT: 19. (wham) Just barely hits as the fist goes
slamming into the side of the dragon's face, big

02:38:22.155 --> 02:38:27.024
old Popeye punch to the side of the jaw. So go
ahead and roll 4d8 points of force damage.

02:38:27.024 --> 02:38:38.196
SAM: 4d8. I'm taking yours, and I hope that's
okay. Ten, 13, 18, 21. Plus something?

02:38:38.196 --> 02:38:45.057
MATT: That's 21 points of damage, nice. (whack) It
gets socked in the jaw. The hand whips around

02:38:45.057 --> 02:38:49.296
again, preparing for the next round. Do you want
to use anything, move, use your bonus action?

02:38:49.296 --> 02:38:59.640
SAM: I'm 20 feet away. I will go 18 feet away from
it and drop the grenade.

02:38:59.640 --> 02:39:02.472
MATT: Okay. So you move forward right here?

02:39:02.472 --> 02:39:05.274
SAM: Yeah, closer to it.

02:39:05.274 --> 02:39:11.787
MATT: Okay. The grenade is right there on the
ground that Percy made. All right. Going to stay

02:39:11.787 --> 02:39:12.961
where you are?

02:39:12.961 --> 02:39:14.346
SAM: Can I keep moving?

02:39:14.346 --> 02:39:18.143
MATT: You can keep moving. You moved 18 feet
backward, you mean?

02:39:18.143 --> 02:39:20.187
SAM: No, I had to move closer to it.

02:39:20.187 --> 02:39:23.551
MATT: Right, so you moved three feet of your 25
feet, dropped it, and you still have 22 feet you

02:39:23.551 --> 02:39:24.955
can move.

02:39:24.955 --> 02:39:26.854
SAM: But if I leave, he's going to whack me.

02:39:26.854 --> 02:39:30.307
MATT: No, he's this far away. You have to be
within a certain range for him to hit you.

02:39:30.307 --> 02:39:32.268
SAM: Wait, how close did I put the grenade to
him?

02:39:32.268 --> 02:39:34.389
MATT: It's currently 18 feet away from him.

02:39:34.389 --> 02:39:36.534
SAM: No, I wanted to put it &lt;i&gt;two&lt;/i&gt; feet away from
him.

02:39:36.534 --> 02:39:44.976
MATT: Oh, I see! There, that makes more sense. So
now there is a grenade on the ground, right there.

02:39:44.976 --> 02:39:50.858
You are there, right next to Grog. So yeah, you
cannot move away without it taking a swipe.

02:39:50.858 --> 02:39:52.036
TRAVIS: Oh, look at that.

02:39:52.036 --> 02:39:53.171
SAM: Hello, I'm a little gnome.

02:39:53.171 --> 02:39:54.460
TRAVIS: It's adorable.

02:39:54.460 --> 02:40:05.055
MATT: All right. That ends your turn. The giant
that's here gets up. That's half of its movement.

02:40:05.055 --> 02:40:10.941
It's enough to get there, moves up behind and is
going to make two of its axe-swipes.

02:40:10.941 --> 02:40:12.433
MARY: Hit him in the arse!

02:40:12.433 --> 02:40:14.544
FELICIA: Butthole.

02:40:14.544 --> 02:40:17.520
SAM: That was crass.

02:40:17.520 --> 02:40:24.232
MATT: 15 doesn't hit. Second attack is going to be
a 13. It's rolling shit. It swings twice and

02:40:24.232 --> 02:40:25.693
manages to catch air.

02:40:25.693 --> 02:40:27.101
FELICIA: The most useless giant.

02:40:27.101 --> 02:40:33.153
MATT: Apparently. But you know what, they didn't
smash you yet. That's a good thing. That brings us

02:40:33.153 --> 02:40:34.482
to Lyra's turn.

02:40:34.482 --> 02:40:37.564
FELICIA: Question. Can I Fireball without hitting
anybody who's friendly?

02:40:37.564 --> 02:40:42.662
MATT: From this point of view, it's going to be
very difficult to pull that off. It's a 20-foot

02:40:42.662 --> 02:40:45.761
radius, so it's going to hit everything within
that sphere.

02:40:45.761 --> 02:40:48.296
TRAVIS: Oh, you actually care about us that much?

02:40:48.296 --> 02:40:53.263
MARY: Can I use-- everybody is really close. All
right.

02:40:53.263 --> 02:41:04.350
FELICIA: Okay, so I can't do that. I think I'm
going to cast Hold Monster.

02:41:04.350 --> 02:41:13.660
MATT: Hold Monster! You take your arcane thoughts
and you put them around, imagining this arcane

02:41:13.660 --> 02:41:18.444
cage that begins to form out of the ether around
the dragon. These bars (crash) and tighten around

02:41:18.444 --> 02:41:21.436
it. The dragon rolls a two for its saving throw.

02:41:21.436 --> 02:41:24.096
(cheering)

02:41:24.096 --> 02:41:26.942
MATT: But it's going to use its Legendary
Resistance to automatically succeed.

02:41:26.942 --> 02:41:28.566
FELICIA: How many of those does he have?!

02:41:28.566 --> 02:41:30.017
TRAVIS: He has one more.

02:41:30.017 --> 02:41:33.385
FELICIA: I need to move.

02:41:33.385 --> 02:41:38.777
MATT: (laughs) The cage tightens around it, and
the dragon takes its wings and (shattering) buffs

02:41:38.777 --> 02:41:41.214
it off, the arcane cage shatters and disappears
into the air.

02:41:41.214 --> 02:41:46.756
FELICIA: I was going to be impressive. Okay. I'm
going to get the H out. I'm going to get as far as

02:41:46.756 --> 02:41:50.666
I can in that corner. Yeah, thank you. Bye-bye.

02:41:50.666 --> 02:41:58.270
MATT: All righty. Good to know. All right, that
ends your turn. That brings us back to the top.

02:41:58.270 --> 02:41:59.755
Percy, you're up.

02:41:59.755 --> 02:42:07.087
TALIESIN: Okay, I'm going to-- That grenade is
sitting on top of people right now, isn't it?

02:42:07.087 --> 02:42:08.262
MATT: Yeah.

02:42:08.262 --> 02:42:10.162
TRAVIS: You mean that hamster, right?

02:42:10.162 --> 02:42:12.229
MATT: Your call, man.

02:42:12.229 --> 02:42:14.914
TRAVIS: Come on, live a little.

02:42:14.914 --> 02:42:17.434
TALIESIN: It's going to hit you.

02:42:17.434 --> 02:42:18.693
TRAVIS: Well, that's all right.

02:42:18.693 --> 02:42:20.842
LAURA: Yeah, but it's also going to hit Scanlan.

02:42:20.842 --> 02:42:23.674
MATT: You still have disadvantage on your attacks,
by the way.

02:42:23.674 --> 02:42:26.008
TALIESIN: Even if my attack is not against the
dragon?

02:42:26.008 --> 02:42:28.405
MATT: As long as it's within eyesight of you,
you're scared.

02:42:28.405 --> 02:42:31.326
TALIESIN: Okay, in that case, I'm going to take a
shot at the dragon for the moment.

02:42:31.326 --> 02:42:32.373
MATT: Okay.

02:42:32.373 --> 02:42:33.859
TALIESIN: Forget about that.

02:42:33.859 --> 02:42:35.860
MATT: Disadvantage on the shot.

02:42:35.860 --> 02:42:41.593
TALIESIN: 19.

02:42:41.593 --> 02:42:45.067
MATT: 19. That's with disadvantage? Does hit.

02:42:45.067 --> 02:42:47.584
(cheering)

02:42:47.584 --> 02:42:54.523
TALIESIN: Oh, that's nice. 26 points of damage.

02:42:54.523 --> 02:42:56.682
MATT: 26 points of damage, nice.

02:42:56.682 --> 02:42:59.045
SAM: Hey! Percy.

02:42:59.045 --> 02:43:00.738
TALIESIN: I have moments.

02:43:00.738 --> 02:43:05.796
MATT: All right, and you reload with the other
one. You can't move closer to it. Do you wish to

02:43:05.796 --> 02:43:07.012
move at all?

02:43:07.012 --> 02:43:11.267
TALIESIN: No, I'm going to hold my position.

02:43:11.267 --> 02:43:13.074
MATT: Okay. Before the end of your turn--

02:43:13.074 --> 02:43:19.684
TALIESIN: I was about to say, before I do that,
I'm going to use a bonus action to do a quick

02:43:19.684 --> 02:43:22.476
heal. I'm going to use second wind.

02:43:22.476 --> 02:43:26.095
MATT: Oh, a second wind, go for it. So you go
ahead and heal yourself 1d10 plus your level.

02:43:26.095 --> 02:43:28.823
TALIESIN: That's 11 points of damage.

02:43:28.823 --> 02:43:32.793
MATT: There you go. So you heal 11 points of
damage. Before your turn is over, it's going to

02:43:32.793 --> 02:43:37.159
use its last legendary action to take its tail and
swing around and whack it at the gnome that it

02:43:37.159 --> 02:43:42.597
heard sneak up behind it and drop something on the
ground. That's going to be a natural 20.

02:43:42.597 --> 02:43:45.139
(shouting)

02:43:45.139 --> 02:43:49.023
LAURA: He said it so happily, too. Evil.

02:43:49.023 --> 02:43:50.542
TALIESIN: You're in trouble.

02:43:50.542 --> 02:43:52.244
SAM: Wait, what did he do?

02:43:52.244 --> 02:43:56.099
MATT: As you drop it, you look up and see its tail
go (whoosh, whack).

02:43:56.099 --> 02:43:57.838
SAM: Whoa, but can I sing real quick?

02:43:57.838 --> 02:44:00.256
MATT: It's a natural 20. There's no way you can
avoid this hit.

02:44:00.256 --> 02:44:05.967
SAM: Maybe it'll fling me away from the grenade.

02:44:05.967 --> 02:44:07.437
FELICIA: (singing) Bye bye bye.

02:44:07.437 --> 02:44:09.698
TRAVIS: No, not cool!

02:44:09.698 --> 02:44:15.474
MATT: 36 points of bludgeoning damage as the tail
slams down onto you.

02:44:15.474 --> 02:44:17.522
LAURA: And also onto the grenade.

02:44:17.522 --> 02:44:20.317
SAM: But it's not a concussion grenade.

02:44:20.317 --> 02:44:23.028
TRAVIS: Oh, I'm right fucking there! I was going
to move!

02:44:23.028 --> 02:44:24.335
LAURA: I'm sorry!

02:44:24.335 --> 02:44:30.108
MATT: And down onto the grenade you set on the
ground. (boom)

02:44:30.108 --> 02:44:32.936
SAM: Is it a concussion grenade? It's already
armed, isn't it?

02:44:32.936 --> 02:44:36.814
MATT: It is filled with black powder, and is a
triggerable mechanism.

02:44:36.814 --> 02:44:38.866
LAURA: I'm sorry. I don't know why I said that.

02:44:38.866 --> 02:44:46.933
MATT: I appreciate the reminder, because I totally
forgot for a second. As it slams into you and the

02:44:46.933 --> 02:44:51.475
ground, it slams into the grenade and there's an
explosion muffled sound from underneath its tail.

02:44:51.475 --> 02:44:57.938
I want Grog and Scanlan to go ahead and make
dexterity saving throws.

02:44:57.938 --> 02:44:59.331
TRAVIS: Yes! 21.

02:44:59.331 --> 02:45:04.073
LAURA: Come on, Scanlan.

02:45:04.073 --> 02:45:05.313
SAM: 20.

02:45:05.313 --> 02:45:08.595
MATT: All right. Both of you guys manage to keep
low to the ground, avoiding most of the blast.

02:45:08.595 --> 02:45:10.215
SAM: I'm already low to the ground.

02:45:10.215 --> 02:45:19.270
MATT: All right. Both of you guys take half damage
from the strike. You both take 12 points of fire

02:45:19.270 --> 02:45:20.684
and bludgeoning damage.

02:45:20.684 --> 02:45:22.104
LAURA: Did the dragon take damage?

02:45:22.104 --> 02:45:26.120
MATT: The dragon does not make its saving throw
against it, though, and takes the full-- what'd I

02:45:26.120 --> 02:45:27.482
tell you guys? 12?

02:45:27.482 --> 02:45:29.877
SAM: All right! The grenade worked!

02:45:29.877 --> 02:45:32.575
(cheering)

02:45:32.575 --> 02:45:37.314
MATT: Pulls its tail up, and there's like a big
arc of smoke off of its tail as it pulls it up and

02:45:37.314 --> 02:45:39.360
shakes out the pain that it just suffered.

02:45:39.360 --> 02:45:44.285
TALIESIN: Can I take this moment of engineering
success to try and pull a wisdom saving throw

02:45:44.285 --> 02:45:46.021
against my fear that I missed on my turn?

02:45:46.021 --> 02:45:49.356
MATT: That's right, forgot that. So go ahead and
make your wisdom saving throw. The explosion was

02:45:49.356 --> 02:45:50.576
the inspiration you required.

02:45:50.576 --> 02:45:51.665
TALIESIN: Natural 20!

02:45:51.665 --> 02:45:53.711
(cheering)

02:45:53.711 --> 02:45:56.992
TALIESIN: It worked! (cackles)

02:45:56.992 --> 02:46:00.939
MATT: With the explosion the grenade set off, you
realize, wait, you might actually have this, and

02:46:01.039 --> 02:46:03.230
it worked! You could do this!

02:46:03.230 --> 02:46:09.959
TALIESIN: I built a thing! And it blew up! Kind of
on purpose!

02:46:09.959 --> 02:46:14.382
MATT: There you go. At the end of your turn,
that's its final legendary action.

02:46:14.382 --> 02:46:15.956
Vex, you're up.

02:46:15.956 --> 02:46:18.065
LAURA: Can I try to shake off the attack?

02:46:18.065 --> 02:46:19.750
MATT: At the end of your turn, you do.

02:46:19.750 --> 02:46:22.344
LAURA: Oh, at the end. But I was inspired by that
explosion!

02:46:22.344 --> 02:46:27.148
MATT: It was inspiring. It may help you shake it
off at the end of the round.

02:46:27.148 --> 02:46:33.734
LAURA: Okay. I'm going to attack it. Oh, that's
such a good roll.

02:46:33.734 --> 02:46:37.724
MARY: That is. Oh, that's even better!

02:46:37.724 --> 02:46:41.791
LAURA: That's okay. It was a disadvantage. That's
27 with a disadvantage with the exploding arrow.

02:46:41.791 --> 02:46:45.742
MATT: With the Exploding Arrow? That does hit.

02:46:45.742 --> 02:46:48.261
TRAVIS: More Percy goodness.

02:46:48.261 --> 02:46:51.185
LAURA: So what do I do? Do I just roll regular?

02:46:51.185 --> 02:47:01.240
MATT: So go ahead and roll regular arrow damage.
With an additional 2d6. Sorry, 3d6. Well, with the

02:47:01.240 --> 02:47:03.724
arrow, it's 2d6. The grenade was 3d6. You're 2d6.

02:47:03.724 --> 02:47:06.978
LAURA: Oh shit. 16 and then 3d6?

02:47:06.978 --> 02:47:08.541
MATT: 3d8, sorry.

02:47:08.541 --> 02:47:09.722
LAURA: 3d8?!

02:47:09.722 --> 02:47:14.897
MATT: Sorry. 3d8 was the grenade. 2d8 for the
exploding arrow. 2d8.

02:47:14.897 --> 02:47:16.010
LAURA: 2d8.

02:47:16.010 --> 02:47:17.356
MATT: Sorry. It's a lot of numbers.

02:47:17.356 --> 02:47:29.662
LAURA: That's okay, I'm going to roll them both.
Okay. Six additional. Did I say what my other

02:47:29.662 --> 02:47:31.870
damage was. Was I speaking out loud?

02:47:31.870 --> 02:47:38.073
MATT: Yeah, no. I marked it down. I also need
Scanlan and Grog to make dexterity saving throws.

02:47:38.073 --> 02:47:39.864
LAURA: Oh no, I'm sorry, I'm stupid!

02:47:39.864 --> 02:47:41.241
SAM: Wait, what did you just shoot at us?

02:47:41.241 --> 02:47:42.423
LAURA: An exploding arrow!

02:47:42.423 --> 02:47:43.640
SAM: Nice.

02:47:43.640 --> 02:47:45.515
TRAVIS: 18.

02:47:45.515 --> 02:47:46.638
SAM: 11.

02:47:46.638 --> 02:47:47.711
MATT: Okay.

02:47:47.711 --> 02:47:51.903
LAURA: I also meant to say I was shooting from my
Blood-Seeker Bow. I pulled it out and said I was

02:47:51.903 --> 02:47:53.302
going to do it.

02:47:53.302 --> 02:47:54.602
MATT: You pull out your Blood-Seeker Bow?

02:47:54.602 --> 02:47:56.462
LAURA: I was going to shoot from my Blood-Seeker
Bow for that.

02:47:56.462 --> 02:47:57.573
MATT: Okay.

02:47:57.573 --> 02:47:58.728
LAURA: Can I do that?

02:47:58.728 --> 02:48:07.321
MATT: I'll let it. So it is now taking an ongoing
ten points of bleeding damage? Now, you take three

02:48:07.321 --> 02:48:16.085
points of fire damage. Scanlan, you take six
points of fire damage. You guys avoid the grenade,

02:48:16.085 --> 02:48:18.793
and then (arrow noises) a second explosion again.

02:48:18.793 --> 02:48:27.515
TALIESIN: I'm sorry. I'm a genius! I'm sorry!
Sorry! Oh god, I'm clever.

02:48:27.515 --> 02:48:31.898
LAURA: So for my second attack, I want to throw
Trinket in and I want Trinket to

02:48:31.898 --> 02:48:34.117
go up and attack him.

02:48:34.117 --> 02:48:38.664
MATT: Trinket rushes in and is going to make two
attacks at it.

02:48:38.664 --> 02:48:43.418
LAURA: He's going to do two claw attacks, so
that's 2d4 each time.

02:48:43.418 --> 02:48:46.891
MATT: Go for it. So go ahead and roll for the
first strike. He's no longer scared, so Trinket

02:48:46.891 --> 02:48:48.376
does not have the disadvantage.

02:48:48.376 --> 02:48:56.440
LAURA: Okay, he doesn't hit on the first one. But
the second one, he gets a 21!

02:48:56.440 --> 02:48:57.970
MATT: 21 hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

02:48:57.970 --> 02:49:01.682
LAURA: Yes! Okay. Was I wrong?

02:49:01.682 --> 02:49:04.884
MARY: That's 23.

02:49:04.884 --> 02:49:06.156
LAURA: Oh, okay. Either way.

02:49:06.156 --> 02:49:07.598
MATT: It hits even harder!

02:49:07.598 --> 02:49:08.671
MARY: It hits harder?

02:49:08.671 --> 02:49:13.481
MATT: (Irish accent) Exactly. What's that about?
Rightly so.

02:49:13.481 --> 02:49:17.133
LAURA: That's 13 extra damage for Trinket.

02:49:17.133 --> 02:49:20.322
MATT: 13 extra damage as Trinket runs up, first
strike hits the armor and just streaks across

02:49:20.322 --> 02:49:25.433
without damage, but as soon as the dragon turns
around to see the giant brown bear that has gotten

02:49:25.433 --> 02:49:29.916
brave enough to strike it, its other claw goes and
sinks into the side of one of its calves and tears

02:49:29.916 --> 02:49:36.468
a portion of the dragon's flesh. It (snarls) roars
and Trinket, bringing its claw down, roars back at

02:49:36.468 --> 02:49:44.191
it. Dragon roar versus bear roar. All right. That
ends your turn. It is now Rimefang's turn.

02:49:44.191 --> 02:49:46.019
Rimefang--

02:49:46.019 --> 02:49:50.612
MARY: He has no more of these legendary saves,
yes?

02:49:50.612 --> 02:49:51.987
SAM: No, he has one.

02:49:51.987 --> 02:49:54.159
MATT: Well, one more legendary resistance.

02:49:54.159 --> 02:49:57.308
FELICIA: He used a wing-buffet and then two
saves.

02:49:57.308 --> 02:49:59.080
SAM: He's got one more.

02:49:59.080 --> 02:50:01.441
FELICIA: Oh, one more save. Ugh.

02:50:01.441 --> 02:50:06.690
SAM: If he chooses to use it. He might save it for
later in the fight.

02:50:06.690 --> 02:50:14.760
MATT: Great. So the dragon is now going to
(flapping) fly--

02:50:14.760 --> 02:50:23.137
SAM: No, he won't. I cast a spell on it as it
retreats from me because I am a war caster.

02:50:23.137 --> 02:50:24.779
MATT: Okay.

02:50:24.779 --> 02:50:28.389
SAM: And I will cast Bigby's Hand to grapple that
shit and pull him back down.

02:50:28.389 --> 02:50:30.847
(cheering)

02:50:30.847 --> 02:50:33.919
MATT: That's right, you took the war caster feat.
Okay.

02:50:33.919 --> 02:50:38.811
SAM: Don't you fly away from me, motherfucker!

02:50:38.811 --> 02:50:42.607
TRAVIS: So hot for you right now.

02:50:42.607 --> 02:50:50.677
MATT: All right, so you use your action to do
Bigby's Clenched, no, Grasping Hand. No, it's--

02:50:50.677 --> 02:50:54.521
SAM: It's the grapple one to pull its wings
together so it can't fly away?

02:50:54.521 --> 02:50:59.461
MATT: Yes. All right, so. So you use the hand's
strength score, so go ahead and roll a d20 and

02:50:59.461 --> 02:51:01.153
then add plus eight to it.

02:51:01.153 --> 02:51:03.376
SAM: 18 plus eight. 26.

02:51:03.376 --> 02:51:13.715
MATT: As the dragon brings its wings up, the hand
grabs its wings together and forces it back down

02:51:13.715 --> 02:51:16.901
to the ground. It shakes off the effect, but it's
unable to fly away.

02:51:16.901 --> 02:51:19.377
SAM: You will leave when Burt Reynolds tells you
to leave!

02:51:19.377 --> 02:51:27.960
(laughter)

02:51:27.960 --> 02:51:33.999
MATT: Okay. You also deal 2d6 plus five damage to
it.

02:51:33.999 --> 02:51:38.163
SAM: 2d6. That's another 18.

02:51:38.163 --> 02:51:42.183
MATT: 18 points of damage as the hand crushes on
it, holding it in place, it does not get a chance

02:51:42.183 --> 02:51:55.083
to move. All right. Angrily, in reaction to that,
the dragon-- well, first off let me see. Does not

02:51:55.083 --> 02:51:59.702
get its breath weapon back yet, unfortunately. It
is going to use multiattack, so it gets three

02:51:59.702 --> 02:52:04.402
attacks: one bite and two claw attacks. It's going
to make all of them against you.

02:52:04.402 --> 02:52:07.818
SAM: Of course it does. And thus ends Scanlan.

02:52:07.818 --> 02:52:10.261
TRAVIS and MARY: No!

02:52:10.261 --> 02:52:14.106
MATT: We'll make each attack as it goes. So the
first attack against you is going to be the bite

02:52:14.106 --> 02:52:16.701
attack. That is a 23 to hit?

02:52:16.701 --> 02:52:18.152
SAM: That hits.

02:52:18.152 --> 02:52:19.477
MATT: All right.

02:52:19.477 --> 02:52:20.808
LAURA: Are you unconscious?

02:52:20.808 --> 02:52:22.189
SAM: I will be very soon.

02:52:22.189 --> 02:52:29.519
MATT: That's going to be 18 points of piercing
damage.

02:52:29.519 --> 02:52:31.708
LAURA: Oh no, Scanlan's unconscious!

02:52:31.708 --> 02:52:41.324
MATT: Are you unconscious? Okay. It would be an
additional d8 points of cold damage. Scanlan falls

02:52:41.324 --> 02:52:50.509
unconscious on the ground. It's going to take a
claw attack down. It's already all-in. Its second

02:52:50.509 --> 02:52:58.639
claw attack hits. You immediately fail a death
saving throw from the second strike. The second

02:52:58.639 --> 02:53:02.158
claw attack hits you, as well, as it's focused on
you. You've failed two death saving throws.

02:53:02.158 --> 02:53:03.767
LAURA: Oh my god!

02:53:03.767 --> 02:53:06.254
SAM: It's a dragon.

02:53:06.254 --> 02:53:11.548
MATT: That's the end of his turn. Grog, you're
up.

02:53:11.548 --> 02:53:18.122
TRAVIS: I race over to Scanlan and I pour a
level-3 healing potion into Scanlan's mouth.

02:53:18.122 --> 02:53:24.573
MATT: Okay, so Grog, you use your action to pull
out, grab Scanlan, and pour it into his mouth.

02:53:24.573 --> 02:53:26.852
This is the superior one?

02:53:26.852 --> 02:53:28.234
TRAVIS: Yes.

02:53:28.234 --> 02:53:31.761
MATT: You heal 8d4 plus eight hit points.

02:53:31.761 --> 02:53:33.215
SAM: Do I roll? Does he roll?

02:53:33.215 --> 02:53:34.631
MATT: I'll let you roll for it; it's fine.

02:53:34.631 --> 02:53:37.841
SAM: 8d4? Can I roll 4d8s?

02:53:37.841 --> 02:53:39.912
MATT: (laughs) 8d4.

02:53:39.912 --> 02:53:41.417
SAM: 8d4.

02:53:41.417 --> 02:53:42.824
MATT: You have a better chance, actually.

02:53:42.824 --> 02:53:45.794
TRAVIS: This is my friend of the lady favors. I
need him!

02:53:45.794 --> 02:53:49.709
MATT: As you see the dragon bites down on him, he
falls unconscious on the ground, the ice around

02:53:49.709 --> 02:53:54.425
his wounds, and his eyes just roll back into his
head, unconscious. One claw slams down into his

02:53:54.425 --> 02:54:00.908
body, the gnome shakes from the impact. The second
claw comes down into his torso and pulls back, you

02:54:00.908 --> 02:54:05.507
can see bits of flesh and muscle pull back from
its claw as it pulls away, and Scanlan's on

02:54:05.507 --> 02:54:09.406
death's door. You rush over and grab and lift him
up, take the healing potion, pop off the cork with

02:54:09.406 --> 02:54:15.113
your teeth, and you rage-feed him the potion.
"Drink it!"

02:54:15.113 --> 02:54:17.472
SAM: I'm at 19 now.

02:54:17.472 --> 02:54:23.453
MATT: So you're at 19 hit points and you're
conscious now, the wounds seal up. You've still

02:54:23.453 --> 02:54:26.441
failed two death saving throws. They're gone until
the end of the battle.

02:54:26.441 --> 02:54:30.276
TRAVIS: Can I do anything else after I've poured
it into his-- can I do anything else?

02:54:30.276 --> 02:54:31.774
MATT: You have a bonus action.

02:54:31.774 --> 02:54:36.667
TRAVIS: Can I throw him the fuck away from the
dragon? Pick him up and chuck him towards Lyra?

02:54:36.667 --> 02:54:40.479
MATT: I'll say because you're frenzied raged,
normally you would get an additional attack. I

02:54:40.479 --> 02:54:42.325
will say you can use that.

02:54:42.325 --> 02:54:45.133
TRAVIS: And I won't throw. I'll slide him on the
icy floor towards Lyra.

02:54:45.133 --> 02:54:48.129
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and make an athletics check.

02:54:48.129 --> 02:54:49.900
TRAVIS: Okay. Natural 20.

02:54:49.900 --> 02:54:52.234
(cheering)

02:54:52.234 --> 02:55:03.157
MATT: As he wakes up, Grog goes (grunts, whoosh)
and slip-n-slides you across the icy floor. You

02:55:03.157 --> 02:55:07.937
come to a stop about 15 feet away-- actually, be
about there. You're still prone; you're on the

02:55:07.937 --> 02:55:08.931
ground.

02:55:08.931 --> 02:55:11.021
LAURA: But you can take a potion on your turn, at
least?

02:55:11.021 --> 02:55:15.759
TRAVIS: And I just turn around and give it the
eyebrow of you're-fucking-dead.

02:55:15.759 --> 02:55:20.476
MATT: (laughs) All right. That ends Grog's turn.
Zahra, you're up.

02:55:20.476 --> 02:55:22.782
MARY: Witch Bolt. Fucking Witch Bolt.

02:55:22.782 --> 02:55:26.139
MATT: By the way, your Bigby's Hand has faded,
because when you fell unconscious you lost

02:55:26.139 --> 02:55:27.997
concentration. Witch Bolt?

02:55:27.997 --> 02:55:33.330
MARY: If you're still within range. I push even
harder for Scanlan's sake.

02:55:33.330 --> 02:55:37.026
MATT: All right. Go ahead and roll 5d12, I believe
it is?

02:55:37.026 --> 02:55:42.930
MARY: The fire turns from white to yellow. I'm
raging. What is it?

02:55:42.930 --> 02:55:46.719
MATT: Whatever the spell is. Is it 5d10 or
5d12?

02:55:46.719 --> 02:55:48.351
MARY: It is 5d12.

02:55:48.351 --> 02:55:51.398
MATT: There you go. 5d12 plus 1d6.

02:55:51.398 --> 02:55:57.168
MARY: Eight. Give me some math here, guys.

02:55:57.168 --> 02:56:10.320
TRAVIS: Okay. 14. 29. 45.

02:56:10.320 --> 02:56:12.247
MARY: 45 plus two.

02:56:12.247 --> 02:56:13.639
LAURA: 47.

02:56:13.639 --> 02:56:14.702
MARY: Plus 11 attack.

02:56:14.702 --> 02:56:16.670
LAURA: No, 47, and 1d6.

02:56:16.670 --> 02:56:18.884
MARY: 1d6. Six.

02:56:18.884 --> 02:56:21.432
MATT: All right, so what's the total damage on
that, then?

02:56:21.432 --> 02:56:22.508
LAURA: 53.

02:56:22.508 --> 02:56:24.975
MARY: 51.

02:56:24.975 --> 02:56:26.945
MATT: 51 points of damage.

02:56:26.945 --> 02:56:33.612
TRAVIS: Did I best you on math? It's a dark day
when Grog beats Vex on math.

02:56:33.612 --> 02:56:36.307
MARY: She's very upset about the whole Scanlan
thing.

02:56:36.307 --> 02:56:38.558
LAURA: I'm still very scared!

02:56:38.558 --> 02:56:47.633
MATT: That is nasty. All right, so. As you blast
again, the fury of seeing Scanlan torn down to the

02:56:47.633 --> 02:56:52.310
ground and nearly devoured by this dragon, you
blast again. This time the greenish-blue energy

02:56:52.310 --> 02:56:57.950
flaring up into a vibrant, angry yellow, and now
you can see what once was almost like a bolt of

02:56:57.950 --> 02:57:03.632
arcane moon energy becomes an actual burning fire
in its visual. Do you wish to move, or are you

02:57:03.632 --> 02:57:05.762
going to stay where you are?

02:57:05.762 --> 02:57:07.749
MARY: I'm still how many feet away from him?

02:57:07.749 --> 02:57:12.001
MATT: You are currently 20 feet away from him.

02:57:12.001 --> 02:57:13.555
MARY: I will stay where I am.

02:57:13.555 --> 02:57:14.886
MATT: All right.

02:57:14.886 --> 02:57:22.271
MARY: Can I give-- no I can't, I'd have to go and
give it to him, wouldn't I?

02:57:22.271 --> 02:57:27.474
MATT: At the end of your turn, because it's
regained its legendary actions, it's going to use

02:57:27.474 --> 02:57:33.872
a wing attack against Grog and every creature
around it, including Trinket and the one giant. So

02:57:33.872 --> 02:57:39.432
as it takes the hit from the Witch Bolt, (heavy
breathing) the arcane hand no longer grasping its

02:57:39.432 --> 02:57:44.205
wings, its wings flare out, (whoosh) and swings
around with its wings, hitting everything around

02:57:44.205 --> 02:57:53.579
you. Dexterity saving throw for Grog, for the
giant, and for Trinket. Giant does not make it.

02:57:53.579 --> 02:57:54.714
TRAVIS: 18.

02:57:54.714 --> 02:57:57.609
MATT: 18, it's a DC 19. Make it for Trinket.

02:57:57.609 --> 02:57:58.707
LAURA: Ten.

02:57:58.707 --> 02:58:02.081
MATT: All right, so Trinket and Grog both take 13
points of bludgeoning damage and are both knocked

02:58:02.081 --> 02:58:03.060
prone.

02:58:03.060 --> 02:58:04.661
TRAVIS: Halved, because I'm raging.

02:58:04.661 --> 02:58:06.718
LAURA: Halved, because he's got Stoneskin.

02:58:06.718 --> 02:58:11.110
MATT: Yeah. Trinket takes half damage, as well. So
you both take seven points of bludgeoning damage,

02:58:11.110 --> 02:58:16.537
but you're still knocked prone. You both fall onto
your back. The giant also is knocked prone there.

02:58:16.537 --> 02:58:25.110
All right. That ends Zahra's turn. That brings us
to Scanlan. You're conscious. You're on the

02:58:25.110 --> 02:58:26.053
ground.

02:58:26.053 --> 02:58:28.179
SAM: I will stand.

02:58:28.179 --> 02:58:33.608
MATT: All right. So you still have half your
movement. You can still move roughly ten feet. Any

02:58:33.608 --> 02:58:34.795
direction.

02:58:34.795 --> 02:58:36.885
SAM: Taking a potion is an action or a bonus?

02:58:36.885 --> 02:58:43.497
MATT: I consider it a bonus action to keep things
moving. Action to administer it to somebody else.

02:58:43.497 --> 02:58:44.912
TRAVIS: Do that thing.

02:58:44.912 --> 02:58:47.945
SAM: I will Dimension Door way over there.

02:58:47.945 --> 02:58:55.765
MATT: (laughs) Okay. Scanlan stands up, waves his
hand, and this blackened archway just (whoosh)

02:58:55.765 --> 02:59:00.168
appears next to him with this crackling sound of
energy. He leaps through it and vanishes out of

02:59:00.168 --> 02:59:05.374
sight. You are now in darkness, you cannot see
anything except for a little bit of light bouncing

02:59:05.374 --> 02:59:08.695
off of the top of the cavern, glittering across
all the ice crystals, but you are in complete

02:59:08.695 --> 02:59:10.843
shadow. (breathing heavily)

02:59:10.843 --> 02:59:15.578
SAM: And I'll take one of those four healing
potions that someone gave us. Were they moderate?

02:59:15.578 --> 02:59:17.567
MATT: They were superior. I think Grog used one.

02:59:17.567 --> 02:59:19.349
FELICIA: Yeah, we handed them out.

02:59:19.349 --> 02:59:22.133
SAM: Okay, I definitely have one, so I'll take
it.

02:59:22.133 --> 02:59:24.176
MATT: 8d4 plus eight.

02:59:24.176 --> 02:59:25.299
LAURA: Who all took them?

02:59:25.299 --> 02:59:27.219
MARY: I didn't, because I have two.

02:59:27.219 --> 02:59:28.893
FELICIA: I don't think she and I took them.

02:59:28.893 --> 02:59:31.596
LAURA: Oh, the four of us, because we're
assholes?

02:59:31.596 --> 02:59:32.994
MATT: I think you each took one.

02:59:32.994 --> 02:59:34.494
FELICIA: I sacrificed myself.

02:59:34.494 --> 02:59:38.951
MATT: So we'll consider that. It's fine. All
right, so that ends Scanlan's turn. The giant is

02:59:38.951 --> 02:59:41.390
going to get up.

02:59:41.390 --> 02:59:43.147
TRAVIS: Get up, Gary, you piece of shit!

02:59:43.147 --> 02:59:50.124
MATT: That would be a 21. That hits. And that'll
be a 17. That misses. But it does manage to hit

02:59:50.124 --> 03:00:03.682
with an attack, finally. This whole time. That's
24 points of slashing damage to the dragon. As its

03:00:03.682 --> 03:00:07.771
first strike whiffs, and as it brings it back with
a backhand, it brings its shield up to protect

03:00:07.771 --> 03:00:17.150
itself. The axe (smack) lands a good seven to
eight inches into the dragon's hide. (roars) The

03:00:17.150 --> 03:00:28.119
head turns around. "You traitor! I will eat every
one of you!" That ends the giant's turn. It's

03:00:28.119 --> 03:00:33.575
going to stay right there, trying to finish him
off. That ends the giant's turn. Lyra, you're up.

03:00:33.575 --> 03:00:36.170
FELICIA: I still can't Fireball, right?

03:00:36.170 --> 03:00:42.494
MATT: You could? Depending on where you want to
place it, you may hit other things.

03:00:42.494 --> 03:00:48.655
LAURA: You can place it-- hit the giant and the
dragon.

03:00:48.655 --> 03:00:54.693
FELICIA: Then the giant will wake up. If we hit
the giants-- does he look almost dead?

03:00:54.693 --> 03:00:58.832
MATT: You can tell he's taken a few hits from the
dragon, but the other one is the one that was

03:00:58.832 --> 03:01:00.092
completely wrecked.

03:01:00.092 --> 03:01:01.478
LAURA: Is the other giant dead?

03:01:01.478 --> 03:01:05.226
MATT: It is frozen in place and dead. It was
partially disintegrated by Lyra earlier, and the

03:01:05.226 --> 03:01:07.227
frost breath finished it off.

03:01:07.227 --> 03:01:09.466
FELICIA: I could maybe hit Trinket or Grog?

03:01:09.466 --> 03:01:10.690
SAM: Trinket's protected.

03:01:10.690 --> 03:01:18.518
FELICIA: I don't think he's protected from fire
damage. It's a lot of damage. I don't want to kill

03:01:18.518 --> 03:01:19.704
Trinket.

03:01:19.704 --> 03:01:22.683
TRAVIS: Is it fire, and it's a frost dragon?

03:01:22.683 --> 03:01:30.074
FELICIA: It's a very big spell. It's 8d6. Can't
really use it. I'll try to Hold Monster again.

03:01:30.074 --> 03:01:33.473
LAURA: How much radius does the dragon take up?

03:01:33.473 --> 03:01:41.820
MATT: The dragon itself is 15 feet across on each
side, so if you were to hit the dragon, it would

03:01:41.820 --> 03:01:43.692
still hit everything directly around it.

03:01:43.692 --> 03:01:48.683
FELICIA: Yeah, let me try to Hold Monster again.
At least force him to use his thing.

03:01:48.683 --> 03:01:55.149
MATT: All right. Actually, he fails his saving
throw, but uses his third and final legendary

03:01:55.149 --> 03:01:58.303
resistance to resist the Hold Monster spell.

03:01:58.303 --> 03:02:00.927
TALIESIN: Good, you drained it. That's over with.

03:02:00.927 --> 03:02:04.810
MATT: He's out of legendary resistance. He turns
around and looks at you now. It was currently

03:02:04.810 --> 03:02:10.544
glaring at the giant, growling at everyone around
it, and as soon as that spell hits it with the

03:02:10.544 --> 03:02:15.584
cage once again, (heavy impacts) it breaks it with
its wings and turns around, (whoosh) and opens its

03:02:15.584 --> 03:02:17.725
mouth right towards you.

03:02:17.725 --> 03:02:20.196
FELICIA: I'm going to move away as far as I can.

03:02:20.196 --> 03:02:22.160
MATT: Okay. So you are here.

03:02:22.160 --> 03:02:25.961
FELICIA: Yes. That's very far. Yes. Thank you.

03:02:25.961 --> 03:02:32.673
MATT: Okay. All right, that ends your turn. Back
up to Percy.

03:02:32.673 --> 03:02:38.076
TALIESIN: All right, I'm going to take one last
really good shot. I'm going to shoot him right in

03:02:38.076 --> 03:02:43.546
the face again. I'm going to spend my grit point
and hit him in the face. Let's make this work.

03:02:43.546 --> 03:02:52.697
Yay! That hits. That's 31 to hit.

03:02:52.697 --> 03:02:57.027
MATT: 31 will hit, yeah. Go ahead and roll
damage.

03:02:57.027 --> 03:03:06.154
TALIESIN: I'm going to roll damage. That's 15
points of damage, but he's got disadvantage on all

03:03:06.154 --> 03:03:07.804
attacks until my turn.

03:03:07.804 --> 03:03:11.386
MATT: He did take ten points of bleeding damage
from your-- Laura. It did take ten points of

03:03:11.386 --> 03:03:18.549
bleeding damage from your bow, and it does save
against the bleed effect, so that's gone,

03:03:18.549 --> 03:03:21.093
unfortunately. But you did ten additional damage
to him.

03:03:21.093 --> 03:03:25.326
TALIESIN: I'm going to move in this direction. Hug
the wall.

03:03:25.326 --> 03:03:27.295
MATT: Right there?

03:03:27.295 --> 03:03:28.576
TALIESIN: Yeah, I think right there.

03:03:28.576 --> 03:03:35.344
MATT: Okay. So as you take your shot, (gunshot) it
ricochets off the armor. The dragon's starting to

03:03:35.344 --> 03:03:38.348
look a little rough. You can see bits of the blood
beginning to seep from the inside of its scales.

03:03:38.348 --> 03:03:42.898
It's starting to look a little harsher and
harsher. It's still standing up pretty well, but

03:03:42.898 --> 03:03:46.629
you can see, it's starting to get a little more
battle-worn. That ends Percy's turn.

03:03:46.629 --> 03:03:47.878
Vex, you're up.

03:03:47.878 --> 03:03:48.719
LAURA: Me?

03:03:48.719 --> 03:03:49.682
MATT: Yes.

03:03:49.682 --> 03:03:51.736
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to move Trinket away.

03:03:51.736 --> 03:03:54.897
MATT: Trinket stands up, and Trinket's going to
move back this way.

03:03:54.897 --> 03:03:59.772
LAURA: Yeah, and then hide behind that outcropping
thing. Yeah.

03:03:59.772 --> 03:04:04.170
MATT: Okay. As he moves away, the dragon uses his
reaction. It's going to be a bite attack on him,

03:04:04.170 --> 03:04:05.284
actually.

03:04:05.284 --> 03:04:06.455
TALIESIN: With disadvantage.

03:04:06.455 --> 03:04:08.646
MATT: With disadvantage?

03:04:08.646 --> 03:04:09.926
TALIESIN: With disadvantage.

03:04:09.926 --> 03:04:13.451
MATT: Oh, because of the head shot. Yeah. Well, it
rolled a two and a 15.

03:04:13.451 --> 03:04:15.858
(cheering)

03:04:15.858 --> 03:04:21.320
MATT: So thank god you put that on there. So as it
(whoosh) lashes out, Trinket's armor actually

03:04:21.320 --> 03:04:26.848
takes the impact, and some of the teeth crack a
little bit against the armor, and the jaw pulls

03:04:26.848 --> 03:04:31.742
back as Trinket just (bear moan) runs off behind
the ice wall. What are you doing?

03:04:31.742 --> 03:04:34.320
LAURA: I'm going to cast Hail of Thorns.

03:04:34.320 --> 03:04:38.365
MATT: Did you make a wisdom save last turn to try
to resist the fear effect?

03:04:38.365 --> 03:04:39.851
LAURA: I did, and I failed it.

03:04:39.851 --> 03:04:41.031
MATT: That's right. Okay.

03:04:41.031 --> 03:04:46.622
LAURA: Yeah. So I'm going to cast Hail of Thorns
on the dragon.

03:04:46.622 --> 03:04:50.785
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and roll for attack.

03:04:50.785 --> 03:04:54.141
LAURA: 26.

03:04:54.141 --> 03:04:58.553
MATT: 26 hits, yes. Hail of Thorns. What's the
radius on that?

03:04:58.553 --> 03:05:04.233
LAURA: That's a good question. Hail of Thorns.

03:05:04.233 --> 03:05:05.916
MATT: (laughs) How's that go?

03:05:05.916 --> 03:05:14.291
LAURA: Okay, wait. Next time you hit a creature
with a ranged weapon-- spell-- range. It just hits

03:05:14.291 --> 03:05:19.567
it, but then everything within five feet makes a
dexterity saving throw. Sorry, guys.

03:05:19.567 --> 03:05:26.876
MATT: So Grog, make a dexterity saving throw.
Because you're prone, I'd say with disadvantage.

03:05:26.876 --> 03:05:28.539
LAURA: Oh. Sorry, Grog.

03:05:28.539 --> 03:05:31.728
TRAVIS: Nine?

03:05:31.728 --> 03:05:33.293
MATT: Actually, you're fine. Just straight roll.

03:05:33.293 --> 03:05:34.456
TRAVIS: Oh, great. 18.

03:05:34.456 --> 03:05:43.074
MATT: 18? All right. You take half of the 1d10
piercing damage. So roll for the actual arrow

03:05:43.074 --> 03:05:52.228
damage, and then 1d10. The giant does not make it,
and the dragon does not make it. They both fail.

03:05:52.228 --> 03:05:55.792
LAURA: 13 for the actual arrow, plus another five
for Hunter's Mark.

03:05:55.792 --> 03:06:00.043
MATT: All right. What's the 1d10 for the Hail of
Thorns?

03:06:00.043 --> 03:06:06.120
LAURA: 3d10 because I'm casting it at 3rd level.
18 for the Hail of Thorns.

03:06:06.120 --> 03:06:12.101
MATT: 18. So that's nine points of damage to you,
Grog. Nine points to the giant, and nine points to

03:06:12.101 --> 03:06:15.863
the dragon. All right.

03:06:15.863 --> 03:06:18.406
LAURA: Oh. And then I get another attack.

03:06:18.406 --> 03:06:20.256
MATT: You do. You have two attacks.

03:06:20.256 --> 03:06:31.430
LAURA: (giggles) This is crazy! Okay, so I'm going
to-- should I do Conjure Barrage? Conjure Barrage

03:06:31.430 --> 03:06:35.789
at them, as well.

03:06:35.789 --> 03:06:42.309
MATT: All right. Conjure Barrage is an action to
cast, right?

03:06:42.309 --> 03:06:48.526
LAURA: Oh, you're right. So a regular. I can only
do a regular attack. Okay, so regular attack. Oh,

03:06:48.526 --> 03:06:50.483
that doesn't hit. That's a 16.

03:06:50.483 --> 03:06:53.744
MATT: That unfortunately does not hit. Well, it
hits, but the arrow shatters across the dragon's

03:06:53.744 --> 03:07:00.257
armor. All right, that ends your turn. As the
giant takes a blasting impact of thorns across its

03:07:00.257 --> 03:07:07.571
torso, it looks to the dragon, Rimefang. Looks at
the rest of you, which some of you have fallen,

03:07:07.571 --> 03:07:13.696
some of you are on the ground. It decides that
perhaps it chose its alliances poorly. And you can

03:07:13.696 --> 03:07:17.946
see, it takes its axe and shield ready, and almost
in a phalanx format is now alongside the dragon.

03:07:17.946 --> 03:07:28.718
All right, that brings us to Rimefang's turn.
Rimefang is going to (flapping) fly up in the

03:07:28.718 --> 03:07:30.006
air.

03:07:30.006 --> 03:07:42.178
TRAVIS: Oh, he's reaching for shit. He duplicates
himself into another dragon. Now you're all dead.

03:07:42.178 --> 03:07:44.435
MATT: Now he's going to--

03:07:44.435 --> 03:07:48.195
TRAVIS: Oh no, the ale's gone!

03:07:48.195 --> 03:08:01.941
MATT: This way, up at the top, and is currently up
in the air (flapping). Let's see. He gets his cold

03:08:01.941 --> 03:08:05.706
breath back. Oh, did you roll to try and shake the
frightened effect, by the way?

03:08:05.706 --> 03:08:06.725
LAURA: I didn't.

03:08:06.725 --> 03:08:08.387
MATT: Go ahead and do that now.

03:08:08.387 --> 03:08:10.876
MARY: Come on, darling. Come on!

03:08:10.876 --> 03:08:14.662
LAURA and TRAVIS: Natural 20!

03:08:14.662 --> 03:08:20.345
MATT: That will do it. As you shake the frightened
effect, you're like, "Ah! All right." You're

03:08:20.345 --> 03:08:23.651
steeled. "No, I know these guys. I'm trying to
kill these guys." As you see it fly overhead.

03:08:23.651 --> 03:08:29.284
Rears back its head and then (whoosh) arc across
the ground with its breath weapon, hitting Percy,

03:08:29.284 --> 03:08:34.668
Vex, and Lyra. You guys all need to make
constitution saving throws.

03:08:34.668 --> 03:08:37.513
TALIESIN: Oh, so there's no disadvantage roll for
him to make here, is there?

03:08:37.513 --> 03:08:38.893
MATT: No.

03:08:38.893 --> 03:08:40.148
FELICIA: 23.

03:08:40.148 --> 03:08:41.828
MATT: 23 on the constitution saving throw?

03:08:41.828 --> 03:08:45.077
FELICIA: Yeah, I actually. I get five
constitution, and I rolled an 18.

03:08:45.077 --> 03:08:47.335
TALIESIN: 15.

03:08:47.335 --> 03:08:51.495
MATT: 15? What did you roll, Vex?

03:08:51.495 --> 03:08:53.275
LAURA: 18.

03:08:53.275 --> 03:09:01.816
MATT: 18. All right. (chuckles) So as the ice
breath (whoosh) passes across, it's like every

03:09:01.816 --> 03:09:07.949
center point of the worst ice storm or blizzard
impacting you with a series of punches every

03:09:07.949 --> 03:09:14.746
single second as this breath caresses and beats
your body left and right. Both of you guys take 54

03:09:14.746 --> 03:09:16.224
points of cold damage.

03:09:16.224 --> 03:09:17.887
TALIESIN: 54?

03:09:17.887 --> 03:09:22.863
MATT: 54. Lyra, you take 27 points of cold
damage.

03:09:22.863 --> 03:09:29.149
TRAVIS: And the room gets quiet.

03:09:29.149 --> 03:09:30.838
MARY: Really fast.

03:09:30.838 --> 03:09:36.509
MATT: It continues its flight pattern (flapping,
impacts) and lands on top of this upper platform.

03:09:36.509 --> 03:09:39.826
LAURA: Oh, he's got another fucking platform?

03:09:39.826 --> 03:09:41.477
SAM: How high up?

03:09:41.477 --> 03:09:48.982
MATT: That's ten feet up. There are two platforms
on opposite sides of this room now. That ends its

03:09:48.982 --> 03:09:53.016
turn. It is now Grog's turn.

03:09:53.016 --> 03:09:56.417
TRAVIS: That giant is definitely against us?

03:09:56.417 --> 03:10:02.549
MATT: It looks to be questioning its loyalty at
the moment, yeah.

03:10:02.549 --> 03:10:06.432
TRAVIS: You questioned at the wrong time. I charge
Gary and hack away.

03:10:06.432 --> 03:10:10.355
MATT: All right. You get up, and you have enough
movement, definitely, to move up into battle with

03:10:10.355 --> 03:10:11.688
him. Go ahead and attack.

03:10:11.688 --> 03:10:22.523
TRAVIS: (laughs) What do I do, again? What is this
shit? This thing plus five. 16. No, attack bonus.

03:10:22.523 --> 03:10:24.328
MATT: You have to hit first. You have to roll to
hit.

03:10:24.328 --> 03:10:27.054
TRAVIS: I know. Jesus! It's like I've never done
this before. 24.

03:10:27.054 --> 03:10:28.985
LAURA: No, that was higher than 24.

03:10:28.985 --> 03:10:32.184
TRAVIS: 16 plus nine? Oh, it's 25.

03:10:32.184 --> 03:10:34.237
MATT: Hits. Roll a second attack.

03:10:34.237 --> 03:10:36.799
TRAVIS: 28.

03:10:36.799 --> 03:10:38.073
MATT: Hits.

03:10:38.073 --> 03:10:39.682
TRAVIS: And 20.

03:10:39.682 --> 03:10:42.673
MATT: 20 hits. Roll damage against the giant.

03:10:42.673 --> 03:10:49.629
TRAVIS: (quietly) What is this, 1d10 plus five?
Oh, that's ten. 18. 18?

03:10:49.629 --> 03:10:52.768
LAURA: Plus six fire damage.

03:10:52.768 --> 03:10:53.754
TRAVIS: Oh.

03:10:53.754 --> 03:10:55.743
LAURA: Six!

03:10:55.743 --> 03:10:58.048
TRAVIS: 24 on the first one.

03:10:58.048 --> 03:10:59.205
MATT: Nice.

03:10:59.205 --> 03:11:04.800
TRAVIS: Sorry, new math. 13 plus-- 17 on the
second one.

03:11:04.800 --> 03:11:06.366
MATT: All right, and the third one?

03:11:06.366 --> 03:11:11.121
TRAVIS: 12, plus-- 15 on the third one.

03:11:11.121 --> 03:11:17.431
MATT: As you rush forward, (whack, whack) the
first two hits, one hits in the side, and you can

03:11:17.431 --> 03:11:21.895
see it (grunts) reacts. The second one, it brings
its shield up, and you splinter the buckler shield

03:11:21.895 --> 03:11:26.742
on its arm, and as it shatters, you can see the
bones in its arm (crunch) crack from the impact,

03:11:26.742 --> 03:11:30.852
and it drops its arm to one side, with the flames
itself beginning to set fire to the furs it has on

03:11:30.852 --> 03:11:35.332
its arm. (grunts) He tries to shake off the fire
that's on its arm. As you see it bring its arm up,

03:11:35.332 --> 03:11:40.391
it reveals the underside of its torso. You use
that to reach down, leap in the air with an

03:11:40.391 --> 03:11:45.057
overhead swipe, slam this warhammer with all your
strength into the side of its ribcage. As you do,

03:11:45.057 --> 03:11:51.459
(crack) you can see its torso cave in, and you're
probably sure that the splintered bones seem to

03:11:51.459 --> 03:11:56.570
have impacted something serious as the giant all
of a sudden, (death rattle).

03:11:56.570 --> 03:11:59.693
(cheering)

03:11:59.693 --> 03:12:02.834
MARY: Dead? Dead!

03:12:02.834 --> 03:12:06.545
MATT: From the damage left over from the battle
you had earlier, the damage it already took from

03:12:06.545 --> 03:12:11.879
the dragon, and that was just enough to finish it
off by two hit points. That ends your turn, Grog.

03:12:11.879 --> 03:12:13.474
Zahra, you're up.

03:12:13.474 --> 03:12:15.269
MARY: How far away from the dragon am I?

03:12:15.269 --> 03:12:18.086
MATT: You are 30 feet away.

03:12:18.086 --> 03:12:22.101
MARY: That's exactly right, which means Witch Bolt
is still in effect, and I'm going to fucking

03:12:22.101 --> 03:12:25.985
unleash on this white wyrm of death.

03:12:25.985 --> 03:12:33.063
MATT: All right! (boof) A third time, now, you
release Witch Bolt. It slams into it. The dragon

03:12:33.063 --> 03:12:34.715
actually tries to shift out of the way--

03:12:34.715 --> 03:12:36.820
MARY: He can't.

03:12:36.820 --> 03:12:38.646
MATT: He can't, because you're locked in.

03:12:38.646 --> 03:12:40.433
MARY: You can't get away from me.

03:12:40.433 --> 03:12:42.519
MATT: Go ahead and roll damage.

03:12:42.519 --> 03:12:43.724
LAURA: Creepy Zahra!

03:12:43.724 --> 03:12:51.358
MARY: Creepy Zahra. Well, I am a demon. All right.
11.

03:12:51.358 --> 03:13:06.958
TRAVIS: 27. 39. 48. 1d6. 53.

03:13:06.958 --> 03:13:08.029
MARY: 53.

03:13:08.029 --> 03:13:09.304
FELICIA: Damn!

03:13:09.304 --> 03:13:11.853
TRAVIS: You bad bitch!

03:13:11.853 --> 03:13:17.360
MATT: All right, so. It tries to dodge out of the
way. This time, as you focus again, the yellowish

03:13:17.360 --> 03:13:22.515
energy has now transitioned to a deep, hot,
searing red flame from your eyes.

03:13:22.515 --> 03:13:24.692
MARY: Oh, you can't run!

03:13:24.692 --> 03:13:29.887
MATT: (boof) You focus again. The beam now,
transitioning into a similar red-hot color,

03:13:29.887 --> 03:13:33.834
streaks across and slams into the side of the
dragon. You can see the impact. The scales are

03:13:33.834 --> 03:13:38.868
left with this glowing red heat from the blast,
and part of its armor is torn open. You can see

03:13:38.868 --> 03:13:45.099
the burn-charred muscle beneath. The dragon's
looking pretty rough. Do you wish to move, or are

03:13:45.099 --> 03:13:46.510
you staying right there?

03:13:46.510 --> 03:13:49.994
MARY: I'm going to approach it by five feet.

03:13:49.994 --> 03:13:56.058
MATT: There you go. That brings us to Scanlan's
turn. You are way over here.

03:13:56.058 --> 03:14:01.475
SAM: I will first use my bonus action on myself.
Can I cast Healing Word on myself?

03:14:01.475 --> 03:14:03.130
MATT: Yeah. Sure.

03:14:03.130 --> 03:14:11.896
SAM: Okay, d4 plus five. That's nothing. Actually,
wait. Can I just take a potion as a bonus action?

03:14:11.896 --> 03:14:13.465
MATT: If you want to, yeah.

03:14:13.465 --> 03:14:16.835
SAM: Okay, I'll just do that. I'll take a greater
heal. 4d4 plus four.

03:14:16.835 --> 03:14:18.017
MATT: All righty.

03:14:18.017 --> 03:14:30.516
SAM: Anyway, I'll roll it later. Sorry. (counts
quietly) Plus four is 11. Okay, I'm pretty much

03:14:30.516 --> 03:14:31.759
back up to--

03:14:31.759 --> 03:14:35.404
MATT: There you go. Are you going to stay where
you are?

03:14:35.404 --> 03:14:36.681
SAM: I'm how far?

03:14:36.681 --> 03:14:37.968
MATT: You are over here.

03:14:37.968 --> 03:14:39.243
SAM: But how far?

03:14:39.243 --> 03:14:45.854
MATT: Oh. It's 90 feet away from you.

03:14:45.854 --> 03:14:50.934
SAM: (whispering) Sniper shot. (louder) From the
shadows, I cast Lightning Bolt, which has a

03:14:50.934 --> 03:14:52.728
hundred-foot range.

03:14:52.728 --> 03:14:54.381
MATT: It does, and because it's high enough--

03:14:54.381 --> 03:14:56.732
SAM: If the angle is nice and clean.

03:14:56.732 --> 03:15:03.383
MATT: Yes, that's true. So out of the darkness,
release a bolt of energy. It's going to attempt to

03:15:03.383 --> 03:15:06.069
make a saving throw. What's the DC on it?

03:15:06.069 --> 03:15:08.980
SAM: It's my spell? What is it?

03:15:08.980 --> 03:15:10.588
MATT: Yeah, it's whatever your spell DC is.

03:15:10.588 --> 03:15:11.578
SAM: 17?

03:15:11.578 --> 03:15:14.717
MATT: 17, okay. It does make its saving throw, so
it is half damage. Go ahead and roll. Rolled a 16

03:15:14.717 --> 03:15:15.876
plus five.

03:15:15.876 --> 03:15:18.529
SAM: It was 8d6, but now it's 4d6, right?

03:15:18.529 --> 03:15:21.535
MATT: No, it's 8d6 still. You roll the total, and
it's halved.

03:15:21.535 --> 03:15:33.941
SAM: All right, what is that? (counts quietly) 26.
13.

03:15:33.941 --> 03:15:35.727
MATT: All right.

03:15:35.727 --> 03:15:38.960
TRAVIS: Yes, dude. Way not to be dead.

03:15:38.960 --> 03:15:42.494
FELICIA: Way to not die.

03:15:42.494 --> 03:15:46.055
TRAVIS: I need my whoring partner.

03:15:46.055 --> 03:15:52.896
MATT: All right, at the end of your turn, it's
going to use one of its legendary actions to make

03:15:52.896 --> 03:15:58.972
a tail attack and reach over the side here at
Percy, who's trying to stay hidden there. Brings

03:15:58.972 --> 03:16:05.755
around his tail. (whoosh) Comes swinging down over
the side. Another natural 20.

03:16:05.755 --> 03:16:08.087
(groaning)

03:16:08.087 --> 03:16:09.231
FELICIA: He looks disappointed.

03:16:09.231 --> 03:16:11.297
LAURA: He doesn't want us to die.

03:16:11.297 --> 03:16:13.134
FELICIA: It's going to happen.

03:16:13.134 --> 03:16:15.722
MARY: No! Would you stop it, Lyra? Come on!

03:16:15.722 --> 03:16:18.527
FELICIA: I'm sorry. I have self-esteem issues.

03:16:18.527 --> 03:16:20.466
MARY: Not today, you don't.

03:16:20.466 --> 03:16:25.578
MATT: 32 points of bludgeoning damage to you,
Percy. (whack) From over the top.

03:16:25.578 --> 03:16:27.204
TALIESIN: I'm out.

03:16:27.204 --> 03:16:32.492
MATT: Percy is down as the tail (whack) slams him
down. You can see now, as the tail pulls back, the

03:16:32.492 --> 03:16:37.055
ice on the ground is slightly concave. There's
pieces of ice that have shattered and jutted up

03:16:37.055 --> 03:16:42.737
from the impact. As the tail pulls away, dropping
chunks of stone and ice, you can see a

03:16:42.737 --> 03:16:47.553
currently unconscious Percy is now face-down and
pushed probably a good half-foot into the ground

03:16:47.553 --> 03:16:51.097
itself. Your face is a mess, if they ever pull you
up from that right now.

03:16:51.097 --> 03:16:53.405
TALIESIN: I like my face.

03:16:53.405 --> 03:17:02.381
MATT: That ends Scanlan's turn. The giant is dead.
There are no giants; they're gone. Lyra, you're

03:17:02.381 --> 03:17:03.236
up.

03:17:03.236 --> 03:17:04.769
FELICIA: Okay, I can Fireball him now.

03:17:04.769 --> 03:17:06.465
(cheering)

03:17:06.465 --> 03:17:15.623
FELICIA: Fireball. Ooh, that looks pretty good!
Six and six and six.

03:17:15.623 --> 03:17:17.980
LAURA: Come on, Lyra. Killing blow.

03:17:17.980 --> 03:17:20.430
TRAVIS: Nuke him. Nuke the bastard.

03:17:20.430 --> 03:17:33.093
FELICIA: So that's 18, 28, 38, 52. 52 points of
damage.

03:17:33.093 --> 03:17:35.390
MATT: 52 points? And what's the DC on your spell?

03:17:35.390 --> 03:17:36.703
FELICIA: It's no DC. It just hits.

03:17:36.703 --> 03:17:38.214
MATT: Right, but it has a save.

03:17:38.214 --> 03:17:39.091
FELICIA: 17.

03:17:39.091 --> 03:17:43.279
MATT: 17. Okay, it rolled a 15 plus five, so it is
half damage, but that's still 26 points of damage

03:17:43.279 --> 03:17:44.152
to it.

03:17:44.152 --> 03:17:45.297
FELICIA: It's not bad.

03:17:45.297 --> 03:17:52.047
MATT: (explosion noise) As you reach out, this
arcing bead of red streaks through the darkness,

03:17:52.047 --> 03:17:56.975
impacts right at the side of the dragon's wing,
and then (boof) bursts into a giant ball of flame.

03:17:56.975 --> 03:18:02.417
The whole cavern rocks from the sound of the
impact. As the dragon pulls back, you can see this

03:18:02.417 --> 03:18:06.529
giant char mark on the outside of its wing. It's
looking pretty rough. It's still standing, but

03:18:06.529 --> 03:18:10.186
it's looking pretty rough. Unfortunately, the
radius of the blast, as it is a 20-foot radius, is

03:18:10.186 --> 03:18:16.409
large enough. Percy, his body is hit in the impact
and blasted onto its back now. He rolls partly out

03:18:16.409 --> 03:18:17.522
of the impact--

03:18:17.522 --> 03:18:18.849
TALIESIN: Do I actually roll?

03:18:18.849 --> 03:18:23.285
MATT: You actually (boof) over there. You're still
technically in the same spot, but you're on your

03:18:23.285 --> 03:18:27.495
back now. You do automatically fail a death saving
throw from that.

03:18:27.495 --> 03:18:30.657
FELICIA: Oh my god, I'm so sorry.

03:18:30.657 --> 03:18:40.835
MATT: All right, that ends Lyra's turn. That
brings us to the top. Percy. Make a saving throw.

03:18:40.835 --> 03:18:43.233
Just roll a ten or higher.

03:18:43.233 --> 03:18:46.382
TALIESIN: I did not roll a ten or higher.

03:18:46.382 --> 03:18:48.203
MATT: You fail a second death saving throw.

03:18:48.203 --> 03:18:50.051
SAM: Oh god!

03:18:50.051 --> 03:18:54.719
MATT: Vex, you're up.

03:18:54.719 --> 03:19:04.654
LAURA: (screams) Okay, here's the thing. Did he
roll far enough away that he is not within ten

03:19:04.654 --> 03:19:06.157
feet of the dragon?

03:19:06.157 --> 03:19:07.867
MATT: The dragon is ten feet up.

03:19:07.867 --> 03:19:09.308
LAURA: So he's far enough away.

03:19:09.308 --> 03:19:13.737
MATT: In theory, he'd be just out of the way of a
ten-foot radius. A 20-foot radius, no.

03:19:13.737 --> 03:19:20.332
LAURA: Okay, then I'm going to Lightning Arrow the
dragon.

03:19:20.332 --> 03:19:21.730
MATT: Okay.

03:19:21.730 --> 03:19:24.451
FELICIA: Do you have a potion?

03:19:24.451 --> 03:19:25.653
TRAVIS: I do.

03:19:25.653 --> 03:19:27.152
TALIESIN: Grog's got it.

03:19:27.152 --> 03:19:33.398
LAURA: Do I have to attack? I do have to attack
regular.

03:19:33.398 --> 03:19:35.189
MATT: You do have to roll the attack, yes.

03:19:35.189 --> 03:19:37.519
LAURA: That's good. That's a 29.

03:19:37.519 --> 03:19:38.631
MATT: 29 hits.

03:19:38.631 --> 03:19:43.568
LAURA: Okay, so that is 4d8 against the dragon.

03:19:43.568 --> 03:19:49.538
MATT: Yeah, 4d8 lightning damage. What's the DC on
it?

03:19:49.538 --> 03:19:51.905
LAURA: 14.

03:19:51.905 --> 03:19:55.355
MATT: 14? It does not make the save. Rolled a
three.

03:19:55.355 --> 03:20:03.960
SAM: Come on, Vex. Come on. Do it for Trinket.

03:20:03.960 --> 03:20:08.267
TRAVIS: Do it for Percy. Do it for Pike.

03:20:08.267 --> 03:20:11.176
TALIESIN: Let's not have another Pike, please.

03:20:11.176 --> 03:20:16.333
LAURA: 17.

03:20:16.333 --> 03:20:18.975
MATT: Plus your Hunter's Mark.

03:20:18.975 --> 03:20:27.765
LAURA: That's good. That's another six for
Hunter's Mark. Plus another 11.

03:20:27.765 --> 03:20:32.114
MATT: Plus another 11. Okay. As the arrow
releases, once again, (arrow flying) it turns into

03:20:32.114 --> 03:20:36.481
a bolt of pure arcane energy, smacking into the
side of it. You can see the explosion hit and the

03:20:36.481 --> 03:20:40.245
energy crackle through the rest of its body. Its
muscles shudder and it has to grasp the side of

03:20:40.245 --> 03:20:45.685
the top of this platform to keep itself steady.
You can see now, the dragon's (heavy breathing).

03:20:45.685 --> 03:20:50.655
One eye is partially closed, and with each breath
you can see this frost mist emanating from its

03:20:50.655 --> 03:20:52.775
breath. It looks like it's on its last legs.

03:20:52.775 --> 03:20:54.359
LAURA: For my second attack--

03:20:54.359 --> 03:20:57.510
(cheering)

03:20:57.510 --> 03:21:06.252
LAURA: For my second attack, I'm going to regular
attack him. Oh my god. Just going to regular

03:21:06.252 --> 03:21:07.346
attack him.

03:21:07.346 --> 03:21:08.458
MATT: Roll for attack.

03:21:08.458 --> 03:21:13.078
LAURA: Jesus. Please. Oh! It's 30.

03:21:13.078 --> 03:21:16.432
MATT: 30 hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

03:21:16.432 --> 03:21:22.522
LAURA: 13, 14, 15.

03:21:22.522 --> 03:21:24.670
MATT: Including the Hunter's Mark?

03:21:24.670 --> 03:21:29.169
LAURA: No! Four.

03:21:29.169 --> 03:21:35.842
MATT: Okay, so 19 total? Okay. As the arrow (arrow
flying, impacts) embeds itself in the side of the

03:21:35.842 --> 03:21:40.529
neck, the dragon reaches up and it's scratching at
the pain. As it pulls the arrow out, blood begins

03:21:40.529 --> 03:21:42.038
to pour down its side.

03:21:42.038 --> 03:21:44.260
LAURA: Ugh, he's still alive!

03:21:44.260 --> 03:21:48.869
MATT: It's rough. That ends your turn.

03:21:48.869 --> 03:21:54.958
LAURA: Fuck! Is it his turn?

03:21:54.958 --> 03:22:06.487
MATT: It is now Rimefang's turn. Rimefang turns.
(heavy breaths, roars) and lets out a spray of icy

03:22:06.487 --> 03:22:13.377
damage out in this direction at an arc this way. I
need to get a dexterity saving throw from Lyra,

03:22:13.377 --> 03:22:16.200
from Vex, and from Zahra.

03:22:16.200 --> 03:22:17.918
MARY: Do I have a reaction?

03:22:17.918 --> 03:22:19.527
MATT: After this, you will.

03:22:19.527 --> 03:22:22.548
MARY: Okay, got it.

03:22:22.548 --> 03:22:23.580
FELICIA: Eight.

03:22:23.580 --> 03:22:24.488
MATT: Eight?

03:22:24.488 --> 03:22:25.808
LAURA: 28.

03:22:25.808 --> 03:22:27.859
MATT: 28. Okay. Zahra?

03:22:27.859 --> 03:22:29.308
MARY: 11.

03:22:29.308 --> 03:22:33.863
MATT: 11. Okay, so that is 54 points of damage to
you.

03:22:33.863 --> 03:22:35.266
FELICIA: I'm down.

03:22:35.266 --> 03:22:41.716
MATT: Lyra is currently (crackles) frozen in
place right now from the blast. She's unconscious,

03:22:41.716 --> 03:22:45.980
and there is a coat of ice around her body holding
her in place. How are you doing on hit points?

03:22:45.980 --> 03:22:48.480
LAURA: I'm at 28 hit points.

03:22:48.480 --> 03:22:54.344
MATT: Okay, you kick the frost off, and you're on
one knee. And you take 54 points of ice damage.

03:22:54.344 --> 03:22:55.900
LAURA: Are you unconscious, too?

03:22:55.900 --> 03:22:58.330
MARY: Nope. I'm not. Do I have a reaction?

03:22:58.330 --> 03:22:59.566
MATT: You have a reaction?

03:22:59.566 --> 03:23:01.634
MARY: I do, I use Hellish Rebuke.

03:23:01.634 --> 03:23:05.128
SAM: Oh! What is that? It sounds hellish.

03:23:05.128 --> 03:23:07.549
MARY: I know. I get one per day.

03:23:07.549 --> 03:23:11.372
MATT: All right, so the creature must make a
dexterity saving throw.

03:23:11.372 --> 03:23:12.879
LAURA: So it does it back to him?

03:23:12.879 --> 03:23:14.159
MARY: Yes.

03:23:14.159 --> 03:23:16.110
MATT: That is 15. What's the DC?

03:23:16.110 --> 03:23:17.732
MARY: I don't know.

03:23:17.732 --> 03:23:18.701
LAURA: 17.

03:23:18.701 --> 03:23:19.734
MARY: 17.

03:23:19.734 --> 03:23:24.832
MATT: Okay, so it takes 2d10 fire damage. Go ahead
and roll that.

03:23:24.832 --> 03:23:27.847
LAURA: Yes! Oh my god, you can kill it just
because it attacked you?!

03:23:27.847 --> 03:23:30.568
TALIESIN: Kill it out of spite.

03:23:30.568 --> 03:23:33.744
FELICIA: Tell him he's very ugly.

03:23:33.744 --> 03:23:35.955
MARY: Nine.

03:23:35.955 --> 03:23:37.723
MATT: Nine points of fire damage?

03:23:37.723 --> 03:23:39.120
How do you want to do this?

03:23:39.120 --> 03:23:41.929
(cheering)

03:23:41.929 --> 03:23:45.123
MARY: I don't know what that means!

03:23:45.123 --> 03:23:49.751
MATT: How do you finish this dragon with your
Hellish Rebuke?

03:23:49.751 --> 03:23:52.076
TALIESIN: Make it good!

03:23:52.076 --> 03:23:59.581
MATT: After it finishes blasting you with ice
damage, you watch the wizard frozen in place. You

03:23:59.581 --> 03:24:04.263
see Percy unconscious and bleeding on the ground.
You see Vex on the ground, about to fall

03:24:04.263 --> 03:24:09.425
unconscious. Your friends are lost in the darkness
around you, and suddenly you feel that tiefling

03:24:09.425 --> 03:24:11.754
surge of anger within you, and you?

03:24:11.754 --> 03:24:18.914
MARY: Almost completely turn into flame as I walk
towards it. Can I use anything?

03:24:18.914 --> 03:24:22.304
MATT: How do you want the Hellish Rebuke to be?

03:24:22.304 --> 03:24:30.243
MARY: I want this Hellish Rebuke to be me
levitating in the air and using my dark dragon

03:24:30.243 --> 03:24:41.822
staff to blast it from here down, just
eviscerating everything from the bowels down with

03:24:41.822 --> 03:24:43.275
hellish fire.

03:24:43.275 --> 03:24:47.800
MATT: So after the frost takes on the front of
you, and there is ice caked against the front of

03:24:47.800 --> 03:24:52.389
your armor, you suddenly look up at it and as your
eyes flare with flame, the ice (shatters)

03:24:52.389 --> 03:24:56.102
evaporates from the sheer heat your body's
emanating. You take a step forward, but the step

03:24:56.102 --> 03:25:00.335
itself is about an inch off the ground. A second
step, you're two inches off the ground. And with

03:25:00.335 --> 03:25:04.243
each progressive step, you're slowly floating in
the air, the warlock energy now swirling around

03:25:04.243 --> 03:25:08.000
you. The shadows are spinning around you and
coalescing around your feet. As you look forward

03:25:08.000 --> 03:25:12.266
towards it, you see the portion of its armor that
was blasted open earlier, with its flesh and sinew

03:25:12.266 --> 03:25:18.225
exposed. You take the staff forward, and with an
angry snarl, the one last blast of infernal

03:25:18.225 --> 03:25:23.273
energy, the Hellish Rebuke then (shooting sound)
sinking into the side of its chest. As the inside

03:25:23.273 --> 03:25:28.587
of its flesh begins to spark and smoke, the dragon
(grunts) reaches out and grabs the side. It's

03:25:28.587 --> 03:25:32.983
beginning to try to bring its wings up to fly
away, and as it does, (explosion noise) a blast of

03:25:32.983 --> 03:25:38.035
infernal flame comes cascading out of its chest.
You can see now, all of its armor begins to peel

03:25:38.035 --> 03:25:46.134
back as its chest is blown open. Its eyes
suddenly go from this piercing blue-white to a

03:25:46.134 --> 03:25:53.669
dull gray color, and it reaches out, and (heavy
breathing) "No." It tumbles forward onto the

03:25:53.669 --> 03:25:59.903
ground next to Percy, almost crushing his
unconscious form. It gets up, (impacts) takes two

03:25:59.903 --> 03:26:03.875
more steps forward. "No. You can't."

03:26:03.875 --> 03:26:08.292
MARY: Yes, I fucking can!

03:26:08.292 --> 03:26:11.642
(cheering)

03:26:11.642 --> 03:26:14.178
MATT: And with that, Rimefang falls dead to the
ground.

03:26:14.178 --> 03:26:18.271
(cheering)

03:26:18.271 --> 03:26:30.229
SAM: I run over to Lyra, cast Seeming on myself to
give myself the appearance of Aldor, and I pour a

03:26:30.229 --> 03:26:34.494
potion into her mouth, and I wake her up.

03:26:34.494 --> 03:26:36.243
FELICIA: What happened?

03:26:36.243 --> 03:26:37.723
SAM: You did good, baby.

03:26:37.723 --> 03:26:39.499
FELICIA: (gasps) And I'm just in him.

03:26:39.499 --> 03:26:44.490
(laughter)

03:26:44.490 --> 03:26:49.437
TRAVIS: I run over to Percy and pour a healing
potion in his mouth, and I don't "in him."

03:26:49.437 --> 03:26:51.995
(laughter)

03:26:51.995 --> 03:26:55.013
MATT: You can just barely get there with your
movement. Thank god you're a barbarian.

03:26:55.013 --> 03:27:01.636
TALIESIN: Oh! What happened? Oh, look. It's dead!

03:27:01.636 --> 03:27:02.976
MARY: Hello, Percy.

03:27:02.976 --> 03:27:06.311
LAURA: Oh my god. I stand up and I give Zahra a
giant hug.

03:27:06.311 --> 03:27:09.263
TALIESIN: Can we cut that bastard up for scrap
now? Ugh.

03:27:09.263 --> 03:27:11.068
LAURA: You were amazing.

03:27:11.068 --> 03:27:12.610
MARY: Forever besties?

03:27:12.610 --> 03:27:17.787
FELICIA: Wait, then I notice. Aldor, why are you
so short?

03:27:17.787 --> 03:27:28.938
SAM: Baby. I can't change height, so I release
Seeming and I'm back to normal.

03:27:28.938 --> 03:27:35.918
FELICIA: That was not as good a kiss as usual. I
was worried, but it was special.

03:27:35.918 --> 03:27:36.915
TRAVIS: Oh!

03:27:36.915 --> 03:27:40.911
(laughter)

03:27:40.911 --> 03:27:45.664
MARY: Is it time to take what we need from this
thing?

03:27:45.664 --> 03:27:48.417
LAURA: Gather up all of the shit we have to take
and put it in the bag of stuff.

03:27:48.417 --> 03:27:53.018
TALIESIN: That would be: two white dragon eyes,
one white dragon tongue, one white dragon heart,

03:27:53.018 --> 03:27:56.680
six white dragon claws, and 20 white dragon
teeth.

03:27:56.680 --> 03:27:58.218
MATT: Who's harvesting this?

03:27:58.218 --> 03:27:59.886
MARY: You have the bag.

03:27:59.886 --> 03:28:02.110
FELICIA: It's nature. Who has good animal
handling?

03:28:02.110 --> 03:28:03.828
LAURA: Wait, we have to harvest it special?

03:28:03.828 --> 03:28:07.721
MATT: Part of harvesting the organs from the
creature is a delicate process.

03:28:07.721 --> 03:28:09.287
LAURA: Is it nature? What is it a check for?

03:28:09.287 --> 03:28:10.514
MATT: It's a nature-based check, yes.

03:28:10.514 --> 03:28:11.882
LAURA: I have a low nature. What do you have?

03:28:11.882 --> 03:28:13.079
TALIESIN: Very low nature.

03:28:13.079 --> 03:28:16.866
MARY: I have a six nature. Can I harvest him?

03:28:16.866 --> 03:28:17.966
MATT: You can.

03:28:17.966 --> 03:28:19.738
TRAVIS: Can I go and loot the giant that's not
frozen?

03:28:19.738 --> 03:28:22.315
MATT: You can. You can also help with this roll.

03:28:22.315 --> 03:28:28.035
SAM: Inspiration? Okay. I inspire them.

03:28:28.035 --> 03:28:31.533
MATT: How do you inspire Zahra as she goes to
start carving into this dragon?

03:28:31.533 --> 03:28:40.022
SAM: I will sing something. I don't know what. I'm
so out of it. We just killed a dragon!

03:28:40.022 --> 03:28:42.323
(laughter)

03:28:42.323 --> 03:28:49.759
SAM: I go over to her and I'm like, (incoherent,
impressed stammering). And that's all I got.

03:28:49.759 --> 03:28:52.114
MATT: And with that, you killed a dragon.

03:28:52.114 --> 03:28:54.280
MARY: It was a group effort.

03:28:54.280 --> 03:28:57.601
LAURA: Can I help at all? Can I assist? Can I hold
her utensils for her?

03:28:57.601 --> 03:29:01.631
MATT: Between the two of you working together,
that would give you advantage on the checks. Which

03:29:01.631 --> 03:29:06.936
one are you going for first? Are you going for the
eyes? Choose which portion you're harvesting

03:29:06.936 --> 03:29:08.028
first.

03:29:08.028 --> 03:29:11.684
LAURA: Everything. We need all of it, don't we?

03:29:11.684 --> 03:29:14.930
MATT: Yeah, but which part are you harvesting
first? You choose with each roll. You have eyes,

03:29:14.930 --> 03:29:15.928
heart--

03:29:15.928 --> 03:29:17.500
FELICIA: Can I assist? Can I help?

03:29:17.500 --> 03:29:18.970
MATT: We already have an assist over there.

03:29:18.970 --> 03:29:20.785
FELICIA: I want to be helpful.

03:29:20.785 --> 03:29:22.643
LAURA: We'll all stand and watch.

03:29:22.643 --> 03:29:25.645
TALIESIN: Start with the eyes.

03:29:25.645 --> 03:29:30.646
LAURA: Pop them out. Pop those bitches out. But
you get an advantage.

03:29:30.646 --> 03:29:33.647
MATT: You will get advantage on it because she's
assisting you.

03:29:33.647 --> 03:29:35.379
MARY: That's nine plus--

03:29:35.379 --> 03:29:37.928
LAURA: Yeah, that's 15 plus six is 21.

03:29:37.928 --> 03:29:45.253
MATT: 21. Okay. As you come over, using a dagger
that you have. Pop very delicately each dragon eye

03:29:45.253 --> 03:29:46.878
out and place it into the satchel.

03:29:46.878 --> 03:29:48.428
LAURA: Into the cooler bag.

03:29:48.428 --> 03:29:54.134
MATT: As you pull each eye out, it's like holding
the coldest orb you've ever held. It actually

03:29:54.134 --> 03:29:59.517
burns your fingers as you clutch it. (gasp) Throw
it inside and have to shake your hand off.

03:29:59.517 --> 03:30:02.424
LAURA: I jiggle them around in the bag. Just
because.

03:30:02.424 --> 03:30:04.510
FELICIA: We have a special crate?

03:30:04.510 --> 03:30:05.554
LAURA: Yeah, I'm holding it.

03:30:05.554 --> 03:30:08.319
TALIESIN: The tongue would be next.

03:30:08.319 --> 03:30:10.967
MATT: All right, go ahead and roll for that.

03:30:10.967 --> 03:30:17.564
LAURA: Plus another roll for advantage. Ooh,
that's way better. Plus six. 23.

03:30:17.564 --> 03:30:22.974
MATT: 23, all right. So you manage to, with the
help of Vex pulling the jaw open, Grog holding

03:30:22.974 --> 03:30:32.062
onto the side, Lyra's supervising. You manage to
get to the base of the tongue, carve off-- And you

03:30:32.062 --> 03:30:38.929
(slurp-pop) pull out the rather massive, very
heavy tongue-- which, once again, this in itself,

03:30:38.929 --> 03:30:44.037
is like (yelps). Put it in real fast. And in the
process of doing so, you suffer two points of cold

03:30:44.037 --> 03:30:47.512
damage, but the tongue has been harvested.

03:30:47.512 --> 03:30:48.953
TALIESIN: A heart.

03:30:48.953 --> 03:30:53.487
MATT: This one's going to be difficult. Part of
the chest is blown open, exposing the interior,

03:30:53.487 --> 03:30:57.410
but there has been damage done to the inside, so
go ahead and attempt this.

03:30:57.410 --> 03:30:58.807
TRAVIS: Two rolls.

03:30:58.807 --> 03:31:05.931
MARY: 12. 14. Plus six is 20.

03:31:05.931 --> 03:31:12.191
MATT: Oh, 20! 20 is just what you needed. You pry
in and crack open a portion of its body, and you

03:31:12.191 --> 03:31:17.197
begin to slowly carve out the portion, the heart,
and the dragon heart itself is massive. It's huge,

03:31:17.197 --> 03:31:19.074
and it takes three of you to pull it out.

03:31:19.074 --> 03:31:22.560
LAURA: How do we fit it in this bag? Is it magic?

03:31:22.560 --> 03:31:25.436
MATT: You don't know, but it's not going to fit in
that satchel.

03:31:25.436 --> 03:31:26.565
MARY: How heavy is it?

03:31:26.565 --> 03:31:29.431
MATT: I'd say it probably weighs a good 200
pounds.

03:31:29.431 --> 03:31:35.053
FELICIA: I should know what people would do in the
guild situation if they had an organ that wouldn't

03:31:35.053 --> 03:31:36.798
fit in the bag, right? We have to preserve it.

03:31:36.798 --> 03:31:41.327
MATT: Travel back quickly or have preservation
magic. Whether it would be a necromancy-based

03:31:41.327 --> 03:31:42.312
magic.

03:31:42.312 --> 03:31:43.333
FELICIA: Nope.

03:31:43.333 --> 03:31:47.995
TRAVIS: We're not shoving it in there? Are we
cutting it in half?

03:31:47.995 --> 03:31:53.627
LAURA: We could roll it up in one of our fancy
robes, though, and hold on to it. And pack it in--

03:31:53.627 --> 03:31:56.495
oh, we, yeah! Let's chisel out some of the ice.

03:31:56.495 --> 03:32:01.457
MATT: As you begin to wrap it up, you notice that
the cold air begins to (cracking) crack around it,

03:32:01.457 --> 03:32:07.662
and the heart itself is freezing, as per the
nature of a freshly dead white dragon. So it might

03:32:07.662 --> 03:32:10.887
be a good thing.

03:32:10.887 --> 03:32:13.151
LAURA: What about all this gold in the cavern?

03:32:13.151 --> 03:32:16.554
TALIESIN: Claws and teeth.

03:32:16.554 --> 03:32:27.204
MARY: Teeth. Yes, roll to carve. Seven. 13.

03:32:27.204 --> 03:32:33.974
MATT: 13. Going through the jaw, you begin
plucking teeth out, piece by piece (cling, cling)

03:32:33.974 --> 03:32:39.290
and most of them, you notice, as part of the
nature of the body, are beginning to decay faster

03:32:39.290 --> 03:32:42.975
than you expected. A lot of the teeth are becoming
brittle and breaking, and as you start pulling

03:32:42.975 --> 03:32:45.828
them out, you're frustrated because with each one
it seems to almost shatter as soon as you claw it

03:32:45.828 --> 03:32:51.099
from the jaw. By the end of it, you manage to
gather about three dragon's teeth before the rest

03:32:51.099 --> 03:32:52.414
of them begin to break.

03:32:52.414 --> 03:32:54.156
TRAVIS: We have a shitload of dragon teeth left
over.

03:32:54.156 --> 03:32:55.832
LAURA: But we need white dragon.

03:32:55.832 --> 03:32:57.417
TRAVIS: He was a white dragon!

03:32:57.417 --> 03:33:00.720
LAURA: Or wait, are you sure it wasn't the blue
dragon that we harvested?

03:33:00.720 --> 03:33:02.675
TRAVIS: No, it was a white dragon, we have 37 left
over.

03:33:02.675 --> 03:33:05.077
LAURA: Okay. We have 37 dragon teeth from the
first white dragon.

03:33:05.077 --> 03:33:09.527
MARY: Can I also get-- if there's any powder left
or anything, for myself, I would like to--

03:33:09.527 --> 03:33:13.067
TALIESIN: Claws, still. We have to get claws
still.

03:33:13.067 --> 03:33:19.406
MARY: I know, but if it's on the ground, and it's
in front of me, I would just like to put it in my

03:33:19.406 --> 03:33:22.037
little bag, to have it for my own spellcasting.

03:33:22.037 --> 03:33:29.239
MATT: Okay, go ahead and make a nature roll for
that. Roll two more nature checks, or one more

03:33:29.239 --> 03:33:30.509
check, with advantage.

03:33:30.509 --> 03:33:32.180
LAURA: Another one.

03:33:32.180 --> 03:33:34.317
MARY: That sucks, too. 13.

03:33:34.317 --> 03:33:38.767
MATT: Okay. You managed to pull out some of the
more sensitive parts of the dragon, but as you

03:33:38.767 --> 03:33:41.355
begin to cut away at some of the scales-- you're
going for the scales or the claws?

03:33:41.355 --> 03:33:45.190
MARY: I was going for the powdered-- the remains
of whatever teeth that we couldn't get.

03:33:45.190 --> 03:33:49.186
MATT: Oh, that! Never mind then, sorry. So then,
that you can gather without a problem. It's

03:33:49.186 --> 03:33:55.953
powdered dragon ice bone, so yeah, that's fine.
All right.

03:33:55.953 --> 03:33:57.502
TALIESIN: We still need claws.

03:33:57.502 --> 03:33:59.008
LAURA: Let's go for claws.

03:33:59.008 --> 03:34:02.709
TRAVIS: One more.

03:34:02.709 --> 03:34:08.406
MARY: Nine. 15.

03:34:08.406 --> 03:34:16.367
MATT: 15? In beginning to pull out the portions of
its hands and getting the base of where the claw

03:34:16.367 --> 03:34:21.737
itself begins to grow, you manage to pull out five
functional dragon claws without them breaking.

03:34:21.737 --> 03:34:23.546
MARY: How many did we need, Percy?

03:34:23.546 --> 03:34:25.387
TALIESIN: Six. Do we have an extra? We have one?

03:34:25.387 --> 03:34:27.426
MATT: You guys, prepared with your bag.

03:34:27.426 --> 03:34:29.345
MARY: Hello! Prepared people!

03:34:29.345 --> 03:34:31.709
TRAVIS: Oh, I looted the giant.

03:34:31.709 --> 03:34:33.637
MATT: All right, you looted the giant.

03:34:33.637 --> 03:34:35.367
MARY: Now can we get some scales?

03:34:35.367 --> 03:34:38.819
LAURA: Just her? All of us?

03:34:38.819 --> 03:34:41.413
MATT: All of you working together to get scales.

03:34:41.413 --> 03:34:43.696
FELICIA: All of us? Free for all?

03:34:43.696 --> 03:34:46.090
MATT: Well, this is the roll they're making for
it.

03:34:46.090 --> 03:34:47.245
LAURA: 20 for scales.

03:34:47.245 --> 03:34:50.896
MATT: 20 for scales, okay. So all of you working
together, you manage to pull off what amounts to

03:34:50.896 --> 03:34:56.912
about 25 pounds of dragon scales. Mind you, the
scales are heavy and they're about that big each.

03:34:56.912 --> 03:35:03.028
It would be enough if you were to bring it to a
master craftsman, to possibly construct a set of

03:35:03.028 --> 03:35:04.349
armor from them.

03:35:04.349 --> 03:35:08.575
LAURA: That's why we have so many pounds of dragon
scales from the previous dragons! We could make

03:35:08.575 --> 03:35:10.560
three sets of armor right now.

03:35:10.560 --> 03:35:14.237
FELICIA: I'm going to look around and just see if
there's a stash or a hoard that he was gathering.

03:35:14.237 --> 03:35:20.208
MATT: All right, there are individual gold pieces
embedded all through. It would take you weeks to

03:35:20.208 --> 03:35:21.532
chisel it all from the walls.

03:35:21.532 --> 03:35:23.151
MARY: Are there any giant gems that we can see?

03:35:23.151 --> 03:35:24.795
MATT: Everyone make a perception check.

03:35:24.795 --> 03:35:26.891
LAURA: I want to get my diamond back, too, from
earlier.

03:35:26.891 --> 03:35:28.761
TRAVIS: Can I loot the bloody giant?

03:35:28.761 --> 03:35:32.011
LAURA: Natural 20 for perception! Ooh! Sparklies!

03:35:32.011 --> 03:35:39.965
MATT: All right. So Grog. You go over to the giant
that's not frozen. Looking at it, most of its

03:35:39.965 --> 03:35:44.046
armor itself is made for a giant's form, much
larger than anything else, and a lot of it has

03:35:44.046 --> 03:35:48.779
been shredded by the dragon, or frozen and broken
from the impact and you, cutting it apart with its

03:35:48.779 --> 03:35:54.097
axe. For the most part, all you're able to find
off of its body are approximately 120 gold pieces,

03:35:54.097 --> 03:35:58.805
which isn't bad. Giants don't really carry a
lot of money on them, usually what they carry on

03:35:58.805 --> 03:36:05.262
them is just trophies from battles they fought
previously. At least, these ones here. What did

03:36:05.262 --> 03:36:06.508
you roll for perception?

03:36:06.508 --> 03:36:07.965
TALIESIN: 16.

03:36:07.965 --> 03:36:08.907
FELICIA: 18.

03:36:08.907 --> 03:36:09.861
SAM: 11.

03:36:09.861 --> 03:36:10.724
MARY: 13.

03:36:10.724 --> 03:36:11.959
LAURA: Natural 20.

03:36:11.959 --> 03:36:17.694
MATT: So as you guys are looking around, the
cavern seems to be fairly barren. You, however,

03:36:17.694 --> 03:36:20.820
Vex, as you walk to the back of the cavern, you
see there are other pieces of partially eaten

03:36:20.820 --> 03:36:25.863
frozen bodies. And you, using a little bit of
torchlight you can pull out, and glancing

03:36:25.863 --> 03:36:30.451
underneath, you see a little bit of shining, more
of a cluster of shining about seven or eight

03:36:30.451 --> 03:36:35.748
inches beneath the ice surface. And you look down
and you can see, there appears to be quite a hoard

03:36:35.748 --> 03:36:39.987
of something frozen beneath the surface of this
cavern.

03:36:39.987 --> 03:36:42.779
FELICIA: Oh I can help! (blasting sounds) I throw
a Fire Bolt.

03:36:42.779 --> 03:36:45.311
MATT: (laughs) You start carving, you're like,
(yelps). Dodge out of the way just in time as

03:36:45.311 --> 03:36:47.110
firebolts begin blasting the ice.

03:36:47.110 --> 03:36:49.925
FELICIA: 14. 14 points of damage.

03:36:49.925 --> 03:36:55.650
MATT: (boom boom) A large chunk of the ice is
blasted out from the Fire Bolt, and you catch your

03:36:55.650 --> 03:36:58.996
breath for a second. It's not enough to get all
the way down, but it does manage to blast away a

03:36:58.996 --> 03:37:00.117
large portion of the ice.

03:37:00.117 --> 03:37:02.634
LAURA: I still have like two points of health,
FYI.

03:37:02.634 --> 03:37:04.946
FELICIA: Oh! I'm sorry! You do look so lovely,
though.

03:37:04.946 --> 03:37:09.770
MATT: And so between the two of you guys, you take
a dagger, you take your staff and you begin

03:37:09.770 --> 03:37:12.706
jamming into the ice. You manage to break it
apart, and you do find beneath there, frozen,

03:37:12.706 --> 03:37:18.672
quite a hoard. You find over the next hour or so,
4,244 gold pieces--

03:37:18.672 --> 03:37:20.188
TRAVIS and TALIESIN: Whoa!

03:37:20.188 --> 03:37:21.226
LAURA: How much?

03:37:21.226 --> 03:37:32.695
MATT: 4,244 gold pieces. A cluster of gems worth
around 850 gold. A singular diamond. It's about

03:37:32.695 --> 03:37:38.297
that large. It's actually a little bit smaller
than the other one you have, but it's worth

03:37:38.297 --> 03:37:48.262
anywhere in the neighborhood of 1,200 gold
pieces. You also manage to find a pair of leather

03:37:48.262 --> 03:37:55.456
gloves with almost gold trim around each one of
the joints. You find what looks like a small

03:37:55.456 --> 03:38:01.763
leather cap that you pull over the head, that a
peasant would wear, and what looks to be one glass

03:38:01.763 --> 03:38:04.341
vial containing an indeterminate liquid.

03:38:04.341 --> 03:38:06.780
LAURA: What is the color of the liquid?

03:38:06.780 --> 03:38:08.824
MATT: From what you can look at the color, it's
like a purplish-blue.

03:38:08.824 --> 03:38:12.924
MARY: Can anybody do a perception check on magical
liquid?

03:38:12.924 --> 03:38:16.014
TRAVIS: I would like to perception check the
leather hat.

03:38:16.014 --> 03:38:19.343
MATT: Make a perception check.

03:38:19.343 --> 03:38:22.020
LAURA: Can anybody do an arcana check on the
leather hat?

03:38:22.020 --> 03:38:24.073
MATT: Oh. Do you have Detect Magic?

03:38:24.073 --> 03:38:25.254
TRAVIS: 16!

03:38:25.254 --> 03:38:26.800
MATT: Or Identify spell?

03:38:26.800 --> 03:38:29.507
FELICIA: No. I thought about them.

03:38:29.507 --> 03:38:34.076
MATT: Okay. Make an arcana check. Well, you guys
have a brief rest here; it should be fine,

03:38:34.076 --> 03:38:37.624
actually. Okay. Looking at it, this is a very
fancy leather hat.

03:38:37.624 --> 03:38:41.734
TRAVIS: It's a fancy leather hat. It's mine.
Dibs!

03:38:41.734 --> 03:38:43.315
TALIESIN: I'm curious about the gloves, myself.

03:38:43.315 --> 03:38:46.630
MATT: You take some time with each one of these
items that you pull out from the ice, and each one

03:38:46.630 --> 03:38:51.288
emanates a magical aura from them. You take the
gloves first and you look at them, and you

03:38:51.288 --> 03:38:55.767
eventually come to realize, oh, you've heard about
this, you read about this in your books. These are

03:38:55.767 --> 03:39:02.510
Gloves of Missile Snaring. They're gloves that
when worn, you have an opportunity to possibly

03:39:02.510 --> 03:39:09.242
snatch a missile out of the air. These gloves seem
to almost meld into your hands when you don them. When

03:39:09.242 --> 03:39:12.291
a ranged weapon attack hits you while you're
wearing them, you can use your reaction to reduce

03:39:12.291 --> 03:39:16.098
the damage by a certain amount, provided you have
a free hand. If you reduce the damage to zero, you

03:39:16.098 --> 03:39:20.493
can catch the missile, midair, (whoosh) stop it
from hitting you.

03:39:20.493 --> 03:39:22.721
TALIESIN: That might be good for you, though.

03:39:22.721 --> 03:39:24.546
LAURA: For anybody with ranged, probably.

03:39:24.546 --> 03:39:26.410
MATT: Anybody who's hit by ranged.

03:39:26.410 --> 03:39:28.643
TALIESIN: I have a two-handed ranged weapon,
though, which you do not.

03:39:28.643 --> 03:39:34.576
MATT: Looking at the hat itself, while not a very
impressive hat, the magical energy on it does give

03:39:34.576 --> 03:39:41.623
you the idea that it is used as an illusion-based
magic. It is a Hat of Disguise. While wearing this

03:39:41.623 --> 03:39:47.180
hat you can use an action to cast the Disguise
Self spell at will. It ends if the hat is

03:39:47.180 --> 03:39:48.222
removed.

03:39:48.222 --> 03:39:50.073
SAM: May I have that one, please?

03:39:50.073 --> 03:39:51.296
TALIESIN: No, Scanlan.

03:39:51.296 --> 03:39:53.448
TRAVIS: What? He can already disappear.

03:39:53.448 --> 03:39:55.956
FELICIA: You'll abuse it. You've already abused
that privilege already.

03:39:55.956 --> 03:40:00.922
SAM: I'm sorry. By the way, your lips taste like
bubblegum.

03:40:00.922 --> 03:40:13.061
MATT: The potion is a Potion of Climbing. You can
actually climb your walking speed for one hour.

03:40:13.061 --> 03:40:14.413
MARY: Like Spider Climb?

03:40:14.413 --> 03:40:16.078
FELICIA: Spider Pig.

03:40:16.078 --> 03:40:17.615
MARY: What's it called?

03:40:17.615 --> 03:40:25.336
MATT: Climbing or scaling cliffs, you can go at
the speed-- normally, you're very slow when you

03:40:25.336 --> 03:40:31.395
climb. You can just parkour up super fast. While
this is happening, because you rolled a 20, you

03:40:31.395 --> 03:40:35.694
look over at the corpses that are frozen on the
ground. You see one of the corpses is wielding a

03:40:35.694 --> 03:40:41.894
sword, and another one of the corpses appears to
have a shattered bow in one hand. You go over and

03:40:41.894 --> 03:40:46.879
see the sword itself is not affected by the ice.
It actually seems to be resisting the ice. You

03:40:46.879 --> 03:40:52.740
(cracking) break it out of the hand. The person
who's holding the bow, currently, the upper torso

03:40:52.740 --> 03:40:56.951
is bitten off and shattered. Part of the body is
ruined. The bow is broken and destroyed, but there

03:40:56.951 --> 03:41:02.504
is a quiver on its back. Within the quiver, you
see most of the arrows are frozen solid within the

03:41:02.504 --> 03:41:05.420
quiver, but there is one that seems unaffected by
the ice.

03:41:05.420 --> 03:41:08.136
LAURA: Can I tell what it is?

03:41:08.136 --> 03:41:12.800
MATT: You pull out the arrow. It appears to be a
deep forest green, and the actual shaft of the

03:41:12.800 --> 03:41:18.873
arrow has a texture to it, almost a rough metallic
texture.

03:41:18.873 --> 03:41:22.707
SAM, MARY, and TRAVIS: Take it!

03:41:22.707 --> 03:41:24.497
LAURA: I'm taking it! Are you kidding me?

03:41:24.497 --> 03:41:27.750
MATT: If you wish to bring those over to Lyra.
Lyra, make an arcana check.

03:41:27.750 --> 03:41:32.160
FELICIA: This is a very interesting arrow. I
haven't seen one of these like this. Oh, wait,

03:41:32.160 --> 03:41:37.060
maybe I have. 27.

03:41:37.060 --> 03:41:41.061
MATT: Good to know. You take the time with it. You
immediately recognize, there is a similar

03:41:41.061 --> 03:41:44.504
enchantment on both of these weapons, and whoever
came in here earlier had the intent of slaying

03:41:44.504 --> 03:41:52.442
this dragon and failed to do so. What you find is
a Dragon-Slayer Longsword. Which is a plus-one

03:41:52.442 --> 03:41:56.503
weapon, normally, but against dragons or people of
the dragon subtype, it deals an additional 3d6

03:41:56.503 --> 03:41:58.037
damage with every hit.

03:41:58.037 --> 03:41:59.561
FELICIA: It's too bad it didn't work for them.

03:41:59.561 --> 03:42:08.474
MATT: And an Arrow of Dragon-Slaying. It's a
singular arrow, a one-use arrow, but if it hits a

03:42:08.474 --> 03:42:14.440
dragon of the dragon race, type, or group, it has
to make a constitution saving throw or take an

03:42:14.440 --> 03:42:20.339
additional 6d10 piercing damage. It's a one-use,
"fuck you, dragon" arrow.

03:42:20.339 --> 03:42:22.560
SAM: 6d10?

03:42:22.560 --> 03:42:23.979
FELICIA: That's very pleasant.

03:42:23.979 --> 03:42:27.638
LAURA: Yeah, right? What is the saving throw?

03:42:27.638 --> 03:42:32.233
SAM: You'll see. You're going to get the paper.

03:42:32.233 --> 03:42:36.663
MATT: So at this point, you guys have taken
probably a good hour and a half or so in this

03:42:36.663 --> 03:42:38.840
cavern. You start seeing water drip.

03:42:38.840 --> 03:42:40.757
LAURA: Oh, we should get out.

03:42:40.757 --> 03:42:44.509
MATT: It's beginning to thaw in the absence of
Rimefang.

03:42:44.509 --> 03:42:52.249
MARY: Well, what's good is, I believe we're within
the three days of the contract, yes?

03:42:52.249 --> 03:42:53.385
MATT: Possibly.

03:42:53.385 --> 03:42:57.774
FELICIA: Well, we got the contract. We completed
it within three days. Now, we have to get back.

03:42:57.774 --> 03:43:01.509
MARY: Yes, we've killed it, so let's go home.

03:43:01.509 --> 03:43:04.190
MATT: Percy, you go and you pull out the contract
real fast to inspect it, and you can see that the

03:43:04.190 --> 03:43:11.594
arcane sigils that were built into it are faded,
and where it looks like each piece of the dragon

03:43:11.594 --> 03:43:19.368
that you harvested correctly, has seemingly had a
strange, glimmering gold shimmer from the actual

03:43:19.368 --> 03:43:20.761
text on the contract.

03:43:20.761 --> 03:43:22.290
LAURA: Lyra, they're going to love you.

03:43:22.290 --> 03:43:26.272
FELICIA: It's so exciting. I can't wait to go to
the mess hall and tell everybody, many times, over

03:43:26.272 --> 03:43:30.368
and over, how this happened together. And you
guys, this has been an amazing journey. Thank

03:43:30.368 --> 03:43:31.476
you.

03:43:31.476 --> 03:43:37.746
MARY: I would like to take just one gold coin
right at the base of the head of what was formerly

03:43:37.746 --> 03:43:42.783
Rimefang for myself. I'll put it in a necklace
when we all go back to town.

03:43:42.783 --> 03:43:46.740
MATT: All right. You take that one gold piece,
pocket it. Take a moment to remember your final

03:43:46.740 --> 03:43:51.957
death blow against the dragon. You guys trek back
through the caverns you arose, back through the

03:43:51.957 --> 03:43:58.008
ruined frost giant village, back into the Vesper
Timberland, find where your horses were currently

03:43:58.008 --> 03:44:03.336
tied up, make your way back towards the city of
Vasselheim. About a day and a half's worth of

03:44:03.336 --> 03:44:09.046
travel later, you notice that the blizzard that
encompassed the six-mile radius of this mountain

03:44:09.046 --> 03:44:14.702
range has faded into a soft fog, and the actual
weather in this area seems to have been connected

03:44:14.702 --> 03:44:20.664
to the presence of the dragon and is slowly
dissipating. You eventually take yourself to the

03:44:20.664 --> 03:44:26.016
base of Vasselheim's main wall. You shout at the
top of the wall, and noticing the group arriving,

03:44:26.016 --> 03:44:31.712
they let the doors open. You can see the giant,
dragon-headed ballistae that line the city walls

03:44:31.712 --> 03:44:36.903
are armed and ready, and upon approval, they move
them away. You enter the city, make your way

03:44:36.903 --> 03:44:43.976
through the Braving Grounds to the Quadroads to
the outside of the Slayer's Take guildhall. As you

03:44:43.976 --> 03:44:50.161
enter the main room, you see Mertin is standing
there. Looks like he's playing a game of solitaire

03:44:50.161 --> 03:44:59.999
with a deck of cards. He looks up. "Well, I'll be
damned. Are you serious? You killed him?"

03:44:59.999 --> 03:45:01.474
FELICIA: Mertin, we did it.

03:45:01.474 --> 03:45:03.325
MATT: "Show me your contract. Show me this
contract."

03:45:03.325 --> 03:45:09.871
FELICIA: I don't know why you'd doubt us. Really,
it's right here.

03:45:09.871 --> 03:45:20.528
MATT: "Well done." And he puts his hand out to
shake your hand.

03:45:20.528 --> 03:45:26.598
FELICIA: Oh my gosh. I start crying. This is the
most proud moment of my life, Mertin. I've admired

03:45:26.598 --> 03:45:30.985
you for so long and the fact (cries) thank you.
And then I just hug him.

03:45:30.985 --> 03:45:39.102
MATT: Okay. He hugs you. "I appreciate it very
much. You lost me 200 gold pieces, but well done.

03:45:39.102 --> 03:45:44.516
"You've proven to be more than I expected. Let me
get the Huntmistress. She will be very happy to

03:45:44.516 --> 03:45:50.875
"see that you've arrived. Aye, my wife. Yes." And
he gets up and leaves. A few moments later, the

03:45:50.875 --> 03:45:58.860
headmaster Vanessa Cyndrial comes in, her tiefling
self with her horns curled behind her head. Walks

03:45:58.860 --> 03:46:09.505
in with this smooth glare. "I must say. Some of
these contracts we put out as a test of your power

03:46:09.505 --> 03:46:16.614
"and will, and to be perfectly honest, I was
pulling for you." She puts out her hand and her

03:46:16.614 --> 03:46:22.406
husband takes a pouch of coin and puts it in her
hand. She takes it and puts it on the side of her

03:46:22.406 --> 03:46:30.589
belt. "I'm impressed by all of you, and by this
token, and by the completed contract. First off,

03:46:30.589 --> 03:46:34.058
"you have definitely proven your worth to the
Slayer's Take."

03:46:34.058 --> 03:46:36.850
FELICIA: Oh my god, that is so sweet, Vanessa.

03:46:36.850 --> 03:46:41.777
MATT: "Keep the emotions in check. We have to put
up a face here. No one wants to see a member of

03:46:41.777 --> 03:46:50.733
"the guild cry. Now, for the rest of you, I would
like to humbly ask if you wish to join the

03:46:50.733 --> 03:46:52.789
"Slayer's Take guild."

03:46:52.789 --> 03:46:54.814
SAM: Yeah, sure, that'll work. The bear, too?

03:46:54.814 --> 03:46:59.284
MATT: "The bear, as well. Best not show him the
back room. We have a few trophies back there that

03:46:59.284 --> 03:47:00.995
"might freak him out."

03:47:00.995 --> 03:47:04.018
TRAVIS: Do we get to work with another leader next
time?

03:47:04.018 --> 03:47:10.243
SAM: What? Because if the answer is yes, we
refuse. This is our leader from now on.

03:47:10.243 --> 03:47:11.522
FELICIA: Thank you so much.

03:47:11.522 --> 03:47:16.023
MATT: "You are able to choose what your group is
at any time. Whatever the contract requires."

03:47:16.023 --> 03:47:26.557
FELICIA: I really appreciate it, but given the
kiss that we had, I realized why Aldor doesn't

03:47:26.557 --> 03:47:34.250
love me is that I don't have enough experience.
Sexually. So I'm going to stay in town to spread

03:47:34.250 --> 03:47:40.429
my wings in that area. And then he'll love me.
Won't he, Vanessa?

03:47:40.429 --> 03:47:48.211
MATT: Vanessa goes, "Lyra, I would recommend this
course of action to not be taken. I would think

03:47:48.211 --> 03:47:54.869
"that would reflect poorly-- I mean, your personal
time is your own, but nevertheless, my dear, this

03:47:54.869 --> 03:47:56.218
"is a very pious house--"

03:47:56.218 --> 03:47:58.032
SAM: I think this is a great idea.

03:47:58.032 --> 03:48:02.941
FELICIA: Oh, no. Not you. You're such a friend to
me. I can't ruin that.

03:48:02.941 --> 03:48:04.511
SAM: You're right.

03:48:04.511 --> 03:48:10.230
MATT: Vanessa walks up and puts her hand on your
shoulder and goes, "We're going to have a talk,

03:48:10.230 --> 03:48:11.561
"woman to woman."

03:48:11.561 --> 03:48:14.305
FELICIA: (whispers) Oh my god, you guys, I'm in!

03:48:14.305 --> 03:48:18.993
MARY: Be straight with her, will you? Please.

03:48:18.993 --> 03:48:25.871
MATT: "I'm going to make sure she doesn't
embarrass the rest of us. So with the contract

03:48:25.871 --> 03:48:33.500
"completed, provide what you've harvested from your
quarry, and payment will be delivered."

03:48:33.500 --> 03:48:38.809
LAURA: I put the bag down that's got all the stuff
in it. And then we take out a couple from the

03:48:38.809 --> 03:48:44.832
white dragon, and put out the other stuff. And
we've got this giant heart right here.

03:48:44.832 --> 03:48:53.127
MATT: The heart, which Grog has been carrying on
his back as you guys travel. (impact sound) It

03:48:53.127 --> 03:48:59.702
hits the table and the wood cracks a little bit
beneath it from the impact. And you can see, the

03:48:59.702 --> 03:49:01.463
ice is starting to melt a bit on the exterior.

03:49:01.463 --> 03:49:03.321
LAURA: Careful, it needs to be preserved.

03:49:03.321 --> 03:49:10.047
MATT: She gives a nod. "Very well. Mertin, please,
provide these for transport to the contract

03:49:10.047 --> 03:49:11.473
"client."

03:49:11.473 --> 03:49:14.276
MARY: Can we ask who actually contracted it?

03:49:14.276 --> 03:49:16.746
MATT: "It's written on the contract itself."

03:49:16.746 --> 03:49:18.104
MARY: Oh, that's right. I'm so sorry.

03:49:18.104 --> 03:49:20.204
MATT: Percy has the contract, currently.

03:49:20.204 --> 03:49:23.429
TALIESIN: I do. Ozwyn Grud?

03:49:23.429 --> 03:49:25.457
TRAVIS: Grundle?

03:49:25.457 --> 03:49:28.790
FELICIA: Alchemist Ozwyn Grud.

03:49:28.832 --> 03:49:32.450
MATT: Make a history check, by the way.

03:49:32.450 --> 03:49:36.689
TALIESIN: May I, as well?

03:49:36.689 --> 03:49:37.843
FELICIA: 21.

03:49:37.843 --> 03:49:42.762
TALIESIN: 25.

03:49:42.762 --> 03:49:52.272
TRAVIS: Oh, a history check? Four. He's a person.

03:49:52.272 --> 03:49:57.482
MARY: I had four, as well. We are so getting shots
later. Like, now.

03:49:57.482 --> 03:50:00.453
LAURA: Nine.

03:50:00.453 --> 03:50:03.882
MATT: All right. The two of you immediately go,
"Huh," and it hits you: you've heard the name

03:50:03.882 --> 03:50:09.453
before. You've heard the name and you're trying to
figure out where it is. You pick it up and say,

03:50:09.453 --> 03:50:21.268
"He's a member of the Arcana Pansophical." It's a
really exclusive group of archmages across the

03:50:21.268 --> 03:50:28.223
entire globe that essentially work together to
keep the peace on a global scale. Of which, you

03:50:28.223 --> 03:50:36.638
know that Arcanist Allura Vysoren is a member of
the Arcana Pansophical.

03:50:36.638 --> 03:50:38.091
TALIESIN: Yes, of course.

03:50:38.091 --> 03:50:40.290
MATT: This is another member of that team, who
ordered this.

03:50:40.290 --> 03:50:44.392
TALIESIN: This is most likely going to good use,
at the very least.

03:50:44.392 --> 03:50:46.751
SAM: So do we collect our money?

03:50:46.751 --> 03:50:49.863
MATT: "Indeed. What is the total on that contract,
if you don't mind repeating?"

03:50:49.863 --> 03:50:51.312
TALIESIN: I was just working that out.

03:50:51.312 --> 03:50:52.664
LAURA: Lots of gold.

03:50:52.664 --> 03:51:02.692
TALIESIN: Lots of gold. It's 1,800 for the dragon
eyes, 1,200 for the dragon tongue. 3,500 for the

03:51:02.692 --> 03:51:10.862
heart. 1,500 for the claws, and then how much for
the dragon teeth?

03:51:10.862 --> 03:51:15.219
LAURA: Per dragon's tooth? Or for all six dragon
teeth?

03:51:15.219 --> 03:51:17.315
TALIESIN: For all 20 dragon teeth.

03:51:17.315 --> 03:51:22.584
MATT: Yeah. Essentially, considering the dragon
teeth that you had already stored, those are used

03:51:22.584 --> 03:51:26.507
in this transaction, as well as the claws. So you
no longer have dragon's teeth and dragon claws

03:51:26.507 --> 03:51:30.510
stored in your bag. However, you've fulfilled the
contract and get full payment for those.

03:51:30.510 --> 03:51:32.058
TRAVIS: We have 12 teeth left.

03:51:32.058 --> 03:51:35.085
SAM: So it's 9,000 total?

03:51:35.085 --> 03:51:36.239
TALIESIN: 9,000 total.

03:51:36.239 --> 03:51:41.873
MATT: "9,000 gold pieces." She reaches beneath,
pulls out a small chest. You see her do something

03:51:41.873 --> 03:51:46.580
beneath the table you don't recognize, and all of a
sudden you hear a clicking sound and she pulls up

03:51:46.580 --> 03:51:51.868
three large sacks of gold (heavy impacts) on the
table. "Divide as you see fit. On top of this, as

03:51:51.868 --> 03:51:57.690
"you have now been accepted to this, when your
other team members arrive, which should be any

03:51:57.690 --> 03:52:03.012
"moment now, in the next day or so, you'll be
inducted, you'll be absolved of your breach of the

03:52:03.012 --> 03:52:08.381
"laws of Vasselheim, and you will also acquire a
small payment in conjunction with the hydra

03:52:08.381 --> 03:52:15.529
"contract. So we will discuss this as soon as your
friends arrive. Until then, feel free to rest,

03:52:15.529 --> 03:52:18.204
"divide the gold, and be on your way."

03:52:18.204 --> 03:52:19.723
LAURA: That's 1,500 each.

03:52:19.723 --> 03:52:20.961
SAM and TALIESIN: Thank you.

03:52:20.961 --> 03:52:22.639
FELICIA: Oh, I don't need any. (laughs)

03:52:22.639 --> 03:52:24.123
LAURA: What about you, Zahra?

03:52:24.123 --> 03:52:26.834
MARY: Oh, I need. I'll take, definitely. Thank
you.

03:52:26.834 --> 03:52:29.744
MATT: "You do not need your money? Well, that will
go back to the guild, thank you."

03:52:29.744 --> 03:52:31.347
TRAVIS: No, she misspoke.

03:52:31.347 --> 03:52:35.454
MARY: She misspoke. I'm so sorry. She completely
misspoke.

03:52:35.454 --> 03:52:38.761
MATT: (chuckles) "Very well." Tosses the coins.

03:52:38.761 --> 03:52:42.655
LAURA: 1,800 each.

03:52:42.655 --> 03:52:49.328
MATT: "Well done. Congratulations, and I look
forward to a very fruitful and profitable future

03:52:49.328 --> 03:52:51.270
"together here at the Slayer's Take."

03:52:51.270 --> 03:52:56.413
TRAVIS: Aye. Scanlan, should we go and make sure
that your wounds are completely healed?

03:52:56.413 --> 03:52:59.329
LAURA: Can we insight check Vanessa really fast?

03:52:59.329 --> 03:53:00.920
MATT: You may. What are you trying to gather?

03:53:00.920 --> 03:53:02.708
LAURA: Just to see what kind of person she is.

03:53:02.708 --> 03:53:05.446
MATT: All right, go for an insight check.

03:53:05.446 --> 03:53:10.295
LAURA: 24.

03:53:10.295 --> 03:53:16.932
MATT: Okay. You know you have a very strong sense
of being able to read a person, and yet she is

03:53:16.932 --> 03:53:24.914
still an enigma to you. She seems earnest. She
seems definitely a shrewd businesswoman, and

03:53:24.914 --> 03:53:28.592
there's a reason this guild has been successful
for as long as she's been at the helm of it. But

03:53:28.592 --> 03:53:33.767
as far as reading her intent? She seems very
guarded and hard to read. You're unable to really

03:53:33.767 --> 03:53:35.128
catch a bead on her.

03:53:35.128 --> 03:53:39.102
FELICIA: Vanessa, I want to thank you for trusting
me with this very difficult task. I know that you

03:53:39.102 --> 03:53:45.335
sent some other people after this dragon, and your
confidence in our abilities over theirs, who were

03:53:45.335 --> 03:53:48.877
defeated? It's just fantastic. I mean, what were
you thinking?

03:53:48.877 --> 03:53:50.525
TRAVIS: What were you thinking?

03:53:50.525 --> 03:53:52.170
TALIESIN: What were you thinking, really?

03:53:52.170 --> 03:53:57.339
MATT: "Well, to be perfectly honest, this dragon
had been a thorn in our side, with previous

03:53:57.339 --> 03:54:03.775
"contracts failed on its side, and you all seemed
so confident in your skills. I figured it would be

03:54:03.775 --> 03:54:08.056
"a good excuse for you to either flee from this
thing and come back with your tail between your

03:54:08.056 --> 03:54:12.225
"legs, or be foolish and get yourself killed, in
which case, you're not a problem of ours anymore

03:54:12.225 --> 03:54:18.547
"and everything's fine. Or, best case scenario,
what you've shown to me today."

03:54:18.547 --> 03:54:20.015
LAURA: Which is that we're amazing.

03:54:20.015 --> 03:54:21.707
TRAVIS: Vox Machina does not flee.

03:54:21.707 --> 03:54:24.865
MARY: Never. Although I'm not a part of it.

03:54:24.865 --> 03:54:27.614
SAM: We'll make you an honorary member.

03:54:27.614 --> 03:54:33.766
MATT: "Anyway, I have business to attend to. Enjoy
your night. Celebrate. And return here when you

03:54:33.766 --> 03:54:37.098
"wish to see your friends hopefully return as
successful as you were."

03:54:37.098 --> 03:54:38.635
SAM and MARY: Thank you.

03:54:38.635 --> 03:54:40.288
TRAVIS: We are sure they will.

03:54:40.288 --> 03:54:46.144
MATT: "Mertin!" "Yes, I know, my dear. I'm taking
it." And he takes the heart and (grunts) lifts it

03:54:46.144 --> 03:54:51.371
over his back and the halfling, as thick as he is,
(grunts) is bringing it to the back room. She

03:54:51.371 --> 03:54:57.208
turns around, gathers the rest of the materials
into a sack, and exits the room. And with that, we

03:54:57.208 --> 03:54:59.821
will conclude tonight's session. Well done!

03:54:59.821 --> 03:55:01.281
SAM: We did it!

03:55:01.281 --> 03:55:02.974
MARY: We survived!

03:55:02.974 --> 03:55:06.602
LAURA: Good job, Mary!

03:55:06.602 --> 03:55:10.769
MATT: By the way, these are your magical items.
You want to go ahead and take those?

03:55:10.769 --> 03:55:12.929
SAM: I have to split.

03:55:12.929 --> 03:55:16.499
TALIESIN: Yes, you're moving.

03:55:16.499 --> 03:55:17.639
FELICIA: Tonight?

03:55:17.639 --> 03:55:18.789
TALIESIN: Tomorrow.

03:55:18.789 --> 03:55:19.923
FELICIA: Oh my goodness.

03:55:19.923 --> 03:55:29.823
MATT: First off, guys, a big round of applause and
appreciation for our guests. Mary, Felicia. You

03:55:29.823 --> 03:55:31.525
guys were fantastic.

03:55:31.525 --> 03:55:34.480
TALIESIN: Guest dragon kill.

03:55:34.480 --> 03:55:40.020
FELICIA: That was very fun. Thank you for letting
me guest and be on the Twitch channel. You guys

03:55:40.020 --> 03:55:46.244
are a joy to have. I'm so proud to be part of the
Geek and Sundry family.

03:55:46.244 --> 03:55:51.282
MARY: I would like to say thank you so much to the
community, to the Critters out there. I've never

03:55:51.282 --> 03:55:57.478
felt so much love overnight and through this last
week. You inspired me today, and all of us, so

03:55:57.478 --> 03:55:59.077
thank you so much.

03:55:59.077 --> 03:56:04.327
ZAC: Speaking of Critters, #CriticalRole is
officially trending on Twitter right now on the

03:56:04.327 --> 03:56:10.866
front page. You guys should all keep that trend
going and go tell us what you think about the show

03:56:10.866 --> 03:56:16.686
and your favorite moments from tonight with
#CriticalRole, @GeekandSundry. A couple of other

03:56:16.686 --> 03:56:22.086
quick announcements. Thank you, Felicia, for
coming out. She's about to leave for a month,

03:56:22.086 --> 03:56:23.134
right?

03:56:23.134 --> 03:56:27.202
FELICIA: I'm going on a book tour, so please, if
you haven't, preorder my book. feliciadaybook.com.

03:56:27.202 --> 03:56:35.240
I'm going to 12 cities, then DragonCon. I'm pretty
excited about it. I'm going all over. I'm sorry,

03:56:35.240 --> 03:56:37.550
Midwest. It'll be fun.

03:56:37.550 --> 03:56:41.980
ZAC: Speaking of her book, guys, we are 60
subscribers away, roughly, from doing another

03:56:41.980 --> 03:56:47.520
signed book giveaway. Subs are what keep this
channel alive. We wouldn't be able to bring you

03:56:47.520 --> 03:56:52.508
this content without subscribers, so let's try to
get that 60 before we're done reading all our

03:56:52.508 --> 03:56:56.964
donations and prizes and everything else. But
actually, I think we're going to play that video

03:56:56.964 --> 03:57:00.210
of Felicia one more time really quick to support
her book tour.

03:57:00.210 --> 03:57:01.888
FELICIA: That's very sweet.

03:57:01.888 --> 03:57:04.986
ZAC: We'll be right back, really quick, with our
donations and everything.

03:57:04.986 --> 03:57:06.166
MATT: Yes.
