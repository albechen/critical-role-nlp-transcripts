00:00:00.093 --> 00:00:04.504
MATT: Hello, everyone, and welcome to tonight's
episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us

00:00:04.504 --> 00:00:09.034
nerdy-ass voice actors sit around playing Dungeons
and Dragons and say inappropriate things before

00:00:09.034 --> 00:00:10.804
the camera starts.

00:00:10.804 --> 00:00:12.330
TRAVIS: Every time!

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:19.954
MATT: Anyway, we have back in person our
illustrious rogue, Vax'ildan.

00:00:19.954 --> 00:00:22.117
TRAVIS: Welcome back, baby!

00:00:22.117 --> 00:00:27.136
MATT: Happy to have you back. Let's get through
our announcements quickly so we can hop into the

00:00:27.136 --> 00:00:32.457
game, because we have a lot to discuss. A lot of
things to see. A lot of places to go. First and

00:00:32.457 --> 00:00:39.123
foremost, if we can give an awesome shout-out to
our sponsor Loot Crate. Once again been awesome

00:00:39.123 --> 00:00:43.727
to the show. Once again, they have their theme this
month. Sam, did you want to say a thing or two?

00:00:43.727 --> 00:00:45.237
SAM: The theme this month is Sam.

00:00:45.237 --> 00:00:47.162
(laughter)

00:00:47.162 --> 00:00:53.425
SAM: It's an odd theme. It's all shirts that I've
worn. No, the theme this month for Loot Crate is

00:00:53.425 --> 00:01:00.437
the anti-hero. That's part of the Loot Crate theme
and the Loot Wear theme. Not just the box, but the

00:01:00.437 --> 00:01:02.801
bag as well. But you know what I love?

00:01:02.801 --> 00:01:04.659
ALL: What do you love, Sam?

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:10.180
SAM: I love toys. I love socks. I love shirts. I
love posters. I love collectibles. I love pins. I

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:21.499
love boxes. And I love deals. And you can get all
of those things in combination if you get a

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:26.357
subscription to Loot Crate. If you use
lootcrate.com/-- that's a forward slash--

00:01:26.357 --> 00:01:32.275
CriticalRole, you will be instantly shown a
showcase of all the Loot Crate offerings. And

00:01:32.275 --> 00:01:39.943
you'll get three, not one, not two, a little less
than four, but $3 off a monthly subscription.

00:01:39.943 --> 00:01:44.815
LAURA: It's just the first month. It's just $3 off
the very first month.

00:01:44.815 --> 00:01:46.945
SAM: Well, that's not as good.

00:01:46.945 --> 00:01:50.655
(laughter)

00:01:50.655 --> 00:01:53.940
SAM: But let's be real, it's still pretty good.

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:56.503
TRAVIS: Where'd you get that great t-shirt you're
wearing?

00:01:56.503 --> 00:01:58.435
SAM: I am the best at advertising.

00:01:58.435 --> 00:02:01.338
(laughter)

00:02:01.338 --> 00:02:04.549
TALIESIN: Why did you have those notes with you?

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:07.352
SAM: (clears throat) Goodbye, Loot Crate.

00:02:07.352 --> 00:02:10.908
(laughter)

00:02:10.908 --> 00:02:14.526
SAM: $3 off the first month is great, though. It's
still great. It's still a good intro. It's

00:02:14.526 --> 00:02:18.283
essentially like getting-- I don't know, I'm
done.

00:02:18.283 --> 00:02:21.088
LAURA: It's $3 just for writing a word.

00:02:21.088 --> 00:02:23.551
LIAM: It gets you in, and when you're in, you
don't want to get out.

00:02:23.551 --> 00:02:27.180
TRAVIS: And they got really good stuff. You got
your t-shirt from Loot Crate, Voltron.

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.110
SAM: Oh! I'm wearing a Loot Crate t-shirt right
now. It fits. It makes me look strong and

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:31.146
handsome.

00:02:31.146 --> 00:02:35.307
MATT: It's true. It's true. If that $3 can buy you
a six-inch sandwich at an undisclosed location

00:02:35.307 --> 00:02:37.870
where sandwiches can be constructed, purchased by
artisans.

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:39.083
TRAVIS: Yes!

00:02:39.083 --> 00:02:41.323
MATT: Thank you so much, Sam.

00:02:41.323 --> 00:02:43.181
SAM: Sure, I did really good.

00:02:43.181 --> 00:02:46.420
MATT: You did great, Sam. That was wonderful.
Taliesin, you're handling it next week.

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:49.661
TALIESIN: (groans) Okay.

00:02:49.661 --> 00:02:51.776
(laughter)

00:02:51.776 --> 00:02:58.612
MATT: All right, next announcements. Two weeks
from now, the first Thursday of September, I

00:02:58.612 --> 00:03:05.048
myself, Marisha, and Taliesin will be out of town.
We'll be in the middle of the desert. However, the

00:03:05.048 --> 00:03:12.281
rest of the crew here will be playing a one-shot
game, dungeon mastered by our wonderful, recently

00:03:12.281 --> 00:03:15.569
proven skilled dungeon master here, Liam O'Brien.

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:17.372
LIAM: I'm all growed up.

00:03:17.372 --> 00:03:24.718
MATT: Somehow in the canon world of Exandria. So
we'll see how that plays out for you guys. I'm

00:03:24.718 --> 00:03:26.371
really excited to see what you pull together,
man.

00:03:26.371 --> 00:03:28.374
LIAM: I have something very delightful planned.

00:03:28.374 --> 00:03:34.026
MATT: So that'll be fun. So look forward to that
in a couple of weeks. We'll be thinking of you

00:03:34.026 --> 00:03:39.678
guys while we're not here, but watch this guy be
evil. It's going to be great. Anything else anyone

00:03:39.678 --> 00:03:41.015
wants to discuss?

00:03:41.015 --> 00:03:43.765
LIAM: I would like to announce that I am so
goddamn happy to be back in this room.

00:03:43.765 --> 00:03:46.702
TRAVIS: Yeah! Back in the pilot chair.

00:03:46.702 --> 00:03:50.179
SAM: Wait a second, pilot chair?

00:03:50.179 --> 00:03:52.792
MARISHA: Just don't think about it too much.

00:03:52.792 --> 00:03:57.514
MATT: Can I also point out today that the official
World of Warcraft Twitter made a Critical Role joke?

00:03:57.514 --> 00:03:59.301
TALIESIN: Is that true?

00:03:59.301 --> 00:04:07.150
MATT: Someone sent them a piece of fanart that had
a Jaina and an Illidan talking, and the Critical

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:12.362
Role, or the response to me from World of
Warcraft, was: the Legion is coming towards you.

00:04:12.362 --> 00:04:24.250
How do you want to do this? That made me happy. So
let's dive in to tonight's episode of chaos and

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:25.509
heroic whim.

00:04:25.509 --> 00:04:26.994
LIAM: What's going to happen?

00:04:26.994 --> 00:04:31.136
MATT: Out here, we dive into tonight's episode of
Critical Role.

00:04:31.136 --> 00:05:57.544
[dramatic music]

00:05:57.619 --> 00:06:03.604
MATT: Welcome back. Last we left off, Vox Machina,
in their search for the Vestiges of Divergence to

00:06:03.604 --> 00:06:08.944
gain artifacts powerful enough to rival,
hopefully, the power of the Chroma Conclave, a

00:06:08.944 --> 00:06:13.419
group of chromatic dragons that have been
terrorizing the countryside of Tal'Dorei. The

00:06:13.419 --> 00:06:20.406
party has just finished their journey through the
Feywild, a strange, magically overgrown realm of

00:06:20.406 --> 00:06:34.277
fey creatures, illusion, and apparently, corrupt
tree-bros. After a fight with this long-mentally

00:06:34.277 --> 00:06:41.769
disturbed fey, heartbroken and driven to vengeance
and soiling the land around him, you defeated him

00:06:41.769 --> 00:06:50.375
and took from him the bow, Fenthras, which you've
been seeking. Your Vestige, Vex.

00:06:50.375 --> 00:06:52.155
LAURA: That's right. That's right.

00:06:52.155 --> 00:06:59.474
MATT: You then gathered hands and through the
magical capabilities of Keyleth, the druid of the

00:06:59.474 --> 00:07:08.364
Air Ashari, you managed to Plane Shift the rest of
the party back to Whitestone itself. Speaking of which--

00:07:08.364 --> 00:07:11.534
LAURA: Already? Already?

00:07:11.534 --> 00:07:15.262
MARISHA: How long have we been gone?

00:07:15.262 --> 00:07:27.212
MATT: All right, and I also need Scanlan, Percy,
and Grog to roll wisdom saving throws.

00:07:27.212 --> 00:07:30.664
SAM: What did we do to deserve that?

00:07:30.664 --> 00:07:39.240
TALIESIN: We all deserve it. We know we do. That
was terrible. I have a thing called Resolve and I

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:41.445
have one usage of it left. May I use it?

00:07:41.445 --> 00:07:43.377
MATT: You get to reroll a saving throw? Yeah, you
may.

00:07:43.377 --> 00:07:44.604
TALIESIN: Okay.

00:07:44.604 --> 00:07:47.799
SAM: Would this be magic, Matt?

00:07:47.799 --> 00:07:49.771
TALIESIN: That's double.

00:07:49.771 --> 00:07:51.161
MARISHA: Goddamn it.

00:07:51.161 --> 00:07:53.026
MATT: It's a magical effect.

00:07:53.026 --> 00:07:55.076
TRAVIS: We're in trouble.

00:07:55.076 --> 00:07:59.515
SAM: If it's not magic, then I have an 11.

00:07:59.515 --> 00:08:00.539
MATT: Okay.

00:08:00.539 --> 00:08:02.006
LIAM: Guys, drama needs conflict.

00:08:02.006 --> 00:08:03.290
TALIESIN: Eight.

00:08:03.290 --> 00:08:04.836
TRAVIS: Six.

00:08:04.836 --> 00:08:06.347
LAURA: Oh my god!

00:08:06.347 --> 00:08:07.569
LIAM: Hot damn!

00:08:07.569 --> 00:08:10.849
TALIESIN: I'm so excited.

00:08:10.849 --> 00:08:18.632
MATT: No. As the portal shifts closed behind you,
you all step out into the center of the Whitestone

00:08:18.632 --> 00:08:28.725
city square. You can see behind you the Sun Tree
where you guys left originally. It is midday.

00:08:28.725 --> 00:08:34.253
Clouds are high in the sky. Little breaks where
you can see beams of sunlight coming through.

00:08:34.253 --> 00:08:40.160
Looks like there's a darker rainstorm coming,
probably in the next half-day or so, off in the

00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:48.281
distant northwest, and there are now townspeople
looking about at the group of you guys. Keyleth,

00:08:48.281 --> 00:08:59.397
Scanlan, Vex, and Vax: returning, your mind feels
a little fuzzy, but overall nothing seems to have

00:08:59.397 --> 00:09:08.165
affected you. You're glad to be back. Percy and
Grog, you are very confused how you got here and

00:09:08.165 --> 00:09:17.050
not quite sure why nothing has happened since you
gathered here as friends. Yes?

00:09:17.050 --> 00:09:22.620
TALIESIN: So do we have a straight piece of
missing time? Are we still waiting to go to the

00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:24.064
Feywild?

00:09:24.064 --> 00:09:29.732
MATT: As far as you guys know right now, you guys
are still waiting.

00:09:29.732 --> 00:09:36.810
MARISHA: That's &lt;i&gt;horrible&lt;/i&gt; for Percy. You've
wanted to go your whole fucking life!

00:09:36.810 --> 00:09:39.049
TRAVIS: All right, I'm ready to go!

00:09:39.049 --> 00:09:41.927
TALIESIN: How long does this spell take?

00:09:41.927 --> 00:09:47.201
TRAVIS: Yeah, do we have to wait long, because I
have the pee. You know? Where you're like

00:09:47.201 --> 00:09:48.657
hide-and-go-seek pee?

00:09:48.657 --> 00:09:50.215
TALIESIN: I did, but I feel fine now.

00:09:50.215 --> 00:09:52.872
LAURA: Ready to go to the actual castle?

00:09:52.872 --> 00:09:54.549
TRAVIS: Feywild.

00:09:54.549 --> 00:09:58.082
LIAM: Keyleth just brought us back. We're back.

00:09:58.082 --> 00:10:00.408
LAURA: We're back from the Feywild.

00:10:00.408 --> 00:10:02.777
TALIESIN: You're a terrible liar. (laughs)

00:10:02.777 --> 00:10:06.729
LIAM: That's true, but it's irrelevant. What the
fuck are you talking about?

00:10:06.729 --> 00:10:08.368
TALIESIN: What are you talking about?

00:10:08.368 --> 00:10:11.629
MARISHA: Does the name Garmelie ring a bell?

00:10:11.629 --> 00:10:15.880
LAURA: If he doesn't remember we went, does that
mean I lose my title?

00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:18.296
LIAM: Maybe you can work it out?

00:10:18.296 --> 00:10:21.294
MARISHA: You titled Vex'ahlia.

00:10:21.294 --> 00:10:22.975
TALIESIN: I did what?

00:10:22.975 --> 00:10:24.395
LAURA: Oh no!

00:10:24.395 --> 00:10:31.277
SAM: You gave Vex'ahlia a title in your Whitestone
kingdom. She was the Duchess of some hut.

00:10:31.277 --> 00:10:34.745
TALIESIN: Can someone who can't successfully lie
to me please explain to me what's going on?

00:10:34.745 --> 00:10:37.561
LAURA: Baroness. Lady Vex'ahlia, Baroness of the
Third House of Whitestone, Grand Mistress of the

00:10:37.561 --> 00:10:38.760
Grey Hunt.

00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:40.250
TALIESIN: How do you know about the Grey Hunt?

00:10:40.250 --> 00:10:43.206
LAURA: I don't know anything about the Grey Hunt,
but it's written down on a piece of paper you gave

00:10:43.206 --> 00:10:44.191
me, Percy.

00:10:44.191 --> 00:10:45.542
TALIESIN: Is it written on a piece of paper?

00:10:45.542 --> 00:10:47.095
MARISHA: It is written on a piece of paper.

00:10:47.095 --> 00:10:51.246
LAURA: That I actually threw out because I fixed
up my notes. So I don't have the piece of paper in

00:10:51.246 --> 00:10:52.833
this world binder.

00:10:52.833 --> 00:10:55.181
TRAVIS: What a dicklord. You did not throw out the
paper.

00:10:55.181 --> 00:10:59.254
MARISHA: Someone wrote it down, right?

00:10:59.254 --> 00:11:04.086
TRAVIS: You piece of shit. Why did you throw it
away? What a fucking--

00:11:04.086 --> 00:11:10.674
TALIESIN: This is how I know you're lying, because
if I had written that down, you wouldn't have

00:11:10.674 --> 00:11:12.592
thrown it away. That's ridiculous.

00:11:12.592 --> 00:11:14.926
LAURA: No, no, it's definitely right here.

00:11:14.926 --> 00:11:18.600
LIAM: Are you certain you're not trying to do
comedy right now?

00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:28.285
TALIESIN: I feel funny. I don't know-- for the
sake of actual sanity, does she actually have the

00:11:28.285 --> 00:11:30.061
piece of paper that he wrote down?

00:11:30.061 --> 00:11:31.184
SAM: Did he write something down?

00:11:31.184 --> 00:11:32.906
TALIESIN: I did, I wrote it down for her and
handed to her.

00:11:32.906 --> 00:11:34.426
LAURA: He did, and it's just, it's in my-- so I
don't have it.

00:11:34.426 --> 00:11:36.860
MATT: You would've had it with you. You would've
definitely had it with you. And yeah, she does.

00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:41.316
LAURA: I would still have it. It's just not in
this particular not-in-that-world binder.

00:11:41.316 --> 00:11:44.414
LIAM: It's not in this realm.

00:11:44.414 --> 00:11:47.204
SAM: The binder that Vex carries is much, much
better.

00:11:47.204 --> 00:11:49.770
TALIESIN: It's got like fur. And some like--

00:11:49.770 --> 00:11:51.986
LAURA: Keeps it under her arm the whole time.

00:11:51.986 --> 00:11:53.503
LIAM: There are more worlds than these.

00:11:53.503 --> 00:11:55.726
LAURA: It's got a happy kitten on it that says
"hang in there."

00:11:55.726 --> 00:11:57.759
LIAM: It says life-- (laughter)

00:11:57.759 --> 00:12:01.627
LAURA: Life needs things to live?

00:12:01.627 --> 00:12:06.500
TALIESIN: I don't know what's so funny about that
either. I don't remember any of that.

00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:08.543
LIAM: It grows on you so quickly, though.

00:12:08.543 --> 00:12:09.617
LAURA: Grog.

00:12:09.617 --> 00:12:10.518
TRAVIS: What?

00:12:10.518 --> 00:12:13.789
MARISHA: Show him the paper, Vex.

00:12:13.789 --> 00:12:19.297
LAURA: Oh, here. It's right here. Right here.
That's your handwriting, don't you see it?

00:12:19.297 --> 00:12:21.041
MARISHA: We were committing.

00:12:21.041 --> 00:12:29.167
TALIESIN: It's fine. I'm happy to commit to this.
Why? What hap--? What?

00:12:29.167 --> 00:12:30.405
LAURA: Oh god.

00:12:30.405 --> 00:12:31.743
MARISHA: We were in Syngorn.

00:12:31.743 --> 00:12:37.895
SAM: Wait, I think I can help. I'm going to cast
Modify Memory on Percy.

00:12:37.895 --> 00:12:43.023
LAURA: And Grog's just content sitting over here
completely blank.

00:12:43.023 --> 00:12:44.921
LIAM: Eating chicken that he found on the road.

00:12:44.921 --> 00:12:50.861
TALIESIN: This is so exciting.

00:12:50.861 --> 00:12:53.113
MARISHA: Little gamey?

00:12:53.113 --> 00:12:57.852
TALIESIN: I've never seen him laugh like that
before.

00:12:57.852 --> 00:13:03.588
MATT: This is-- this is a way to do it. All right.
All right.

00:13:03.588 --> 00:13:06.479
SAM: I can help you remember, Percy. Just look
into my eyes.

00:13:06.479 --> 00:13:07.584
TALIESIN: I don't want to.

00:13:07.584 --> 00:13:09.122
SAM: Look into my eyes.

00:13:09.122 --> 00:13:13.500
(laughter)

00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:16.617
TALIESIN: Well, that's getting giffed. Okay,
yeah.

00:13:16.617 --> 00:13:21.457
LAURA: But wait, are you just going to make up
what he remembers? No!

00:13:21.457 --> 00:13:24.498
MATT: Percy, I need you to make a wisdom saving
throw.

00:13:24.498 --> 00:13:27.550
TALIESIN: Oh, and I'm out of Resolve.

00:13:27.550 --> 00:13:30.696
MATT: What is your spell DC? Is this with the
cone? Scanlan, is this with the cone?

00:13:30.696 --> 00:13:33.309
SAM: With the cone. I want this to work.

00:13:33.309 --> 00:13:36.949
MARISHA: You're going to pull-- screaming in his
face.

00:13:36.949 --> 00:13:39.992
TALIESIN: Wow, eight.

00:13:39.992 --> 00:13:41.215
MARISHA: What the fuck?

00:13:41.215 --> 00:13:49.949
MATT: Scanlan, how do you modify his memory?
Because at this level you can alter the memories

00:13:49.949 --> 00:13:52.267
of an event that took up to seven days ago.

00:13:52.267 --> 00:13:53.650
TRAVIS: What level are you doing?

00:13:53.650 --> 00:13:55.267
SAM: Level seven.

00:13:55.267 --> 00:13:58.178
MATT: But you can only modify ten minutes of it.

00:13:58.178 --> 00:14:02.456
LIAM: Speaking as Liam, remember that this is a
man who gave an evil sword-- he gave crystal meth

00:14:02.456 --> 00:14:03.652
to Grog.

00:14:03.652 --> 00:14:09.043
TALIESIN: The best crystal meth! The finest
crystal meth in Christendom.

00:14:09.043 --> 00:14:14.946
SAM: I can change any memory. Ah, what was it
called?

00:14:14.946 --> 00:14:16.238
TALIESIN: Ten minutes.

00:14:16.238 --> 00:14:19.749
SAM: What was your title called? There's nothing
on this piece of paper!

00:14:19.749 --> 00:14:21.978
(laughter)

00:14:21.978 --> 00:14:26.001
TRAVIS: Inception.

00:14:26.001 --> 00:14:35.855
LAURA: Lady Vex'ahlia. Baroness of the Third House
of Whitestone and the Grand Mistress of the Grey Hunt.

00:14:35.855 --> 00:14:38.464
SAM: Jesus Christ. Baroness of what?

00:14:38.464 --> 00:14:41.352
LAURA: Of the Third House of Whitestone.

00:14:41.352 --> 00:14:43.671
TALIESIN: And Grand Mistress of the Grey Hunt.

00:14:43.671 --> 00:14:46.019
LIAM: I have no patience for any of this shit.

00:14:46.019 --> 00:14:51.897
SAM: Whitestone and Grand Mistress of the Grey
Hunt.

00:14:51.897 --> 00:14:56.393
LAURA: Of all the ten minutes to have him
remember, maybe that's not the one to focus on.

00:14:56.393 --> 00:14:58.758
TALIESIN: It's not remembering. He's going to be
making it up. I'm not actually going to remember

00:14:58.758 --> 00:15:00.027
it, he's going to lie.

00:15:00.027 --> 00:15:04.972
LAURA: Make up something wonderful for him. He's
wanted to go there his entire life. Make something

00:15:04.972 --> 00:15:05.848
magical.

00:15:05.848 --> 00:15:07.706
TALIESIN: You don't have time to have this
conversation. This is happening right now.

00:15:07.706 --> 00:15:08.812
MATT: Yeah, go for it.

00:15:08.812 --> 00:15:11.322
TALIESIN: This isn't happening. Fuck with me. I'm
so excited.

00:15:11.322 --> 00:15:12.605
MATT: Scanlan.

00:15:12.605 --> 00:15:15.637
SAM: Oh my god. When did we leave? How many days
has it been?

00:15:15.637 --> 00:15:21.499
MATT: It's been close to a week in the Feywild
total, all the nights you've rested.

00:15:21.499 --> 00:15:24.163
SAM: I can only modify ten minutes of time.

00:15:24.163 --> 00:15:24.987
MATT: Correct.

00:15:24.987 --> 00:15:26.500
SAM: So I can't build the whole story up.

00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:30.257
MATT: No, he'll remember ten minutes that you plug
in right now.

00:15:30.257 --> 00:15:33.367
TALIESIN: And by remember meaning whatever you
explain.

00:15:33.367 --> 00:15:34.420
SAM: All right.

00:15:34.420 --> 00:15:39.584
MATT: And remember, as truth, whatever ten minutes
he hands out. This spell is one of my favorite

00:15:39.584 --> 00:15:40.655
spells in the game.

00:15:40.655 --> 00:15:41.579
TRAVIS: This is amazing.

00:15:41.579 --> 00:15:52.083
SAM: All right, I don't know. I'm going to make
him remember that we landed in the Feywild

00:15:52.083 --> 00:15:59.145
together as a group. It was a beautiful field
filled with naked nymphs and fey creatures that

00:15:59.145 --> 00:16:02.913
all came to him and gave him a wonderful full-body
massage.

00:16:02.913 --> 00:16:08.208
TALIESIN: Very uncomfortable, all right. But no,
that was tension. Okay, yes.

00:16:08.208 --> 00:16:17.688
SAM: Vex saw him and he did not want anyone to
know about this moment that he had. So in a fit of

00:16:17.688 --> 00:16:25.166
panic, he gave her something, anything, a title. A
title to make her keep her confidence. The title

00:16:25.166 --> 00:16:32.502
was Lady Vex'ahlia, the Baroness of the Third
House of Whitestone and Grand Mistress of the Gray Hut.

00:16:32.502 --> 00:16:37.014
(laughter)

00:16:37.014 --> 00:16:39.581
LAURA: Oh no.

00:16:39.581 --> 00:16:46.157
SAM: She agreed to keep his secret and he had a
wonderful time before his memory fades.

00:16:46.157 --> 00:16:59.627
TALIESIN: Oh my. Wait, that was-- we were-- but
there was-- you shouldn't, no! Yes! I did do this. Yes.

00:16:59.627 --> 00:17:00.725
LAURA: You remember?

00:17:00.725 --> 00:17:05.010
TALIESIN: I do, and we will never discuss why
again, but yes, I did do this, and I'm so glad I

00:17:05.010 --> 00:17:11.771
wrote it down correctly because that was very
embarrassing. I'll have this approved.

00:17:11.771 --> 00:17:13.596
LAURA: Approved?

00:17:13.596 --> 00:17:17.544
TALIESIN: Yes, well, I'm going to make sure I have
to-- of course inform-- Yes.

00:17:17.544 --> 00:17:20.153
TRAVIS: Who's yes?

00:17:20.153 --> 00:17:31.995
MATT: It seems the awkward curse of the Feywild
has set into a couple of your allies.

00:17:31.995 --> 00:17:40.623
TALIESIN: I, apparently, am missing an awful lot
of time. But this did happen. Yes, okay.

00:17:40.623 --> 00:17:44.264
LIAM: Well, Percival, look at this. Show him the
bow.

00:17:44.264 --> 00:17:48.459
TALIESIN: Oh, that kind of bow.

00:17:48.459 --> 00:17:49.851
TRAVIS: Whoa!

00:17:49.851 --> 00:17:56.112
LAURA: Oh, Grog, it's really badass. You killed
the guy that was holding it. You.

00:17:56.112 --> 00:17:58.957
TRAVIS: Me? So it's mine?

00:17:58.957 --> 00:18:06.763
MARISHA: I pull out the piece of the petrified
crocodile. We killed this, too. This is all that's

00:18:06.763 --> 00:18:08.062
left of him.

00:18:08.062 --> 00:18:10.407
TRAVIS: What? Those are like amazing things.

00:18:10.407 --> 00:18:13.507
LAURA: Wait, is this normal? Would we have known
that this is normal for people to lose their

00:18:13.507 --> 00:18:15.687
memory when they come out of the fucking Feywild?

00:18:15.687 --> 00:18:16.768
MATT: No, you would have no idea.

00:18:16.768 --> 00:18:21.212
LAURA: We wouldn't have learned any of that in our
studies. No?

00:18:21.212 --> 00:18:28.798
MATT: Your studies aren't extensive on the
Feywild, and the people that may know, partially,

00:18:28.798 --> 00:18:32.525
are suffering from the circumstance.

00:18:32.525 --> 00:18:36.003
TRAVIS: There's a petrified crocodile. What else
did you see while we were in this magical place?

00:18:36.003 --> 00:18:38.324
SAM: To be honest, my memory is foggy as well.

00:18:38.324 --> 00:18:42.416
MATT: No, a little bit. But you guys weren't heavy
studiers. You weren't the most studious children.

00:18:42.416 --> 00:18:44.102
LAURA: (whispers) I was a studious child.

00:18:44.102 --> 00:18:45.231
MATT: For certain things.

00:18:45.231 --> 00:18:49.206
LAURA: I was a very studious child. He cheated off
my tests all the time. I was incredibly studious.

00:18:49.206 --> 00:18:59.675
MARISHA: Percy, I am so sorry. I know how badly
you wanted to go there. But here's the good news.

00:18:59.675 --> 00:19:03.781
Now that I've been there, we can go back at any
time.

00:19:03.781 --> 00:19:08.121
TALIESIN: Really? You promise?

00:19:08.121 --> 00:19:11.018
LAURA: Grog, did this happen last time you went to
the Feywild?

00:19:11.018 --> 00:19:12.641
TRAVIS: What?

00:19:12.641 --> 00:19:14.722
LAURA: When you-- do you remember-- okay.

00:19:14.722 --> 00:19:19.411
LIAM: I really don't think we need to worry about
Grog so much. I think he's fine.

00:19:19.411 --> 00:19:20.755
TRAVIS: Thank you.

00:19:20.755 --> 00:19:25.918
LAURA: You killed so many things, Grog. You fought
so many people.

00:19:25.918 --> 00:19:28.251
TALIESIN: Oh god! Did we get alcohol? Did someone
give us alcohol?

00:19:28.251 --> 00:19:29.676
LAURA: No.

00:19:29.676 --> 00:19:30.555
TALIESIN: Damn.

00:19:30.555 --> 00:19:31.958
LIAM: But that can happen today.

00:19:31.958 --> 00:19:34.162
TALIESIN: Yeah, but it won't be fairy alcohol, but
I know.

00:19:34.162 --> 00:19:36.591
MARISHA: Yeah, we've been, naturally, without
alcohol.

00:19:36.591 --> 00:19:40.866
LAURA: We need to find Pike. Pike came to help
us.

00:19:40.866 --> 00:19:42.217
TALIESIN: How long have we been gone for?

00:19:42.217 --> 00:19:43.322
SAM: Pike was there.

00:19:43.322 --> 00:19:44.800
LAURA: Five days?

00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:46.841
SAM: I don't know, it's a bit foggy, but a few
days.

00:19:46.841 --> 00:19:50.543
LIAM: Guys, let's just go find a wizard and some
alcohol, in whichever order.

00:19:50.543 --> 00:19:53.772
TALIESIN: I'm going to go file this and I'll meet
you in a moment.

00:19:53.772 --> 00:19:57.338
LAURA: There's Gilmore, we could talk to him.
Allura? Maybe she can help.

00:19:57.338 --> 00:20:01.856
TALIESIN: Here. I'm going to make sure that that's
finalized with the correct spelling.

00:20:01.856 --> 00:20:13.906
LIAM: Jabba the Hutt. Not that grand to me. I
start walking off towards the castle.

00:20:13.906 --> 00:20:16.256
SAM: We're in Whitestone?

00:20:16.256 --> 00:20:17.963
MATT: You're in Whitestone, currently, yes.

00:20:17.963 --> 00:20:18.951
LIAM: Come on!

00:20:18.951 --> 00:20:20.129
SAM: All right, let's go.

00:20:20.129 --> 00:20:22.816
TRAVIS: We just left there.

00:20:22.816 --> 00:20:24.570
LIAM: Just eat your pigeon and come along, Grog.

00:20:24.570 --> 00:20:27.773
TALIESIN: Strange. Suddenly, I am hungry. Are you
suddenly hungry?

00:20:27.773 --> 00:20:29.736
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:20:29.736 --> 00:20:32.444
TALIESIN: We should eat something.

00:20:32.444 --> 00:20:34.006
LAURA: I make sure Trinket's out of the necklace.

00:20:34.006 --> 00:20:37.262
MARISHA: Yes, I could use a glass of wine.

00:20:37.262 --> 00:20:39.949
TALIESIN: I could use a carafe of wine.

00:20:39.949 --> 00:20:45.138
MATT: Trinket licks the side of your face. Nuzzles
you as you walk towards the castle.

00:20:45.138 --> 00:20:50.170
TRAVIS: Wait, if you got a bow, and there were
pixies, and you gave her something, did I get

00:20:50.170 --> 00:20:52.178
anything? Did I pick up any diseases?

00:20:52.178 --> 00:20:53.859
LAURA: Lots of diseases.

00:20:53.859 --> 00:21:04.650
SAM: You fought bravely. And often. You wielded
your weapon strongly and proudly, and had many

00:21:04.650 --> 00:21:12.569
definite physical encounters, and were never
frozen. And showed your power and defended us to

00:21:12.569 --> 00:21:14.199
the best of your ability.

00:21:14.199 --> 00:21:15.808
LIAM: You waded through blood, Grog.

00:21:15.808 --> 00:21:18.001
TRAVIS: Can I insight check Scanlan?

00:21:18.001 --> 00:21:21.062
MATT: (laughs) You can. Scanlan, make a deception
check.

00:21:21.062 --> 00:21:23.836
TRAVIS: Six!

00:21:23.836 --> 00:21:26.932
SAM: Okay, good. 17.

00:21:26.932 --> 00:21:29.197
(laughter)

00:21:29.197 --> 00:21:30.541
TALIESIN: Holy Jesus.

00:21:30.541 --> 00:21:35.628
MATT: Seems legit, and a part of you is
disappointed that you can't recall this memory.

00:21:35.628 --> 00:21:39.403
But even just them speaking of it is almost half
of the fun, so.

00:21:39.403 --> 00:21:42.571
TRAVIS: That's pretty great. I like all those
things you said.

00:21:42.571 --> 00:21:44.671
SAM: You were great.

00:21:44.671 --> 00:21:49.512
TRAVIS: Did I get any new weapons? I won't be able
to pull it out of the bag of holding unless I know

00:21:49.512 --> 00:21:50.608
what's in there.

00:21:50.608 --> 00:21:51.756
SAM: That's true.

00:21:51.756 --> 00:21:53.857
TALIESIN: I'm going to check my pockets for
anything interesting.

00:21:53.857 --> 00:21:55.163
TRAVIS: I don't have pockets.

00:21:55.163 --> 00:21:58.047
LAURA: Percy, your sketchbook.

00:21:58.047 --> 00:22:00.432
TALIESIN: My sketchbook, yes, what about it?

00:22:00.432 --> 00:22:02.503
LAURA: You made sketches the entire time.

00:22:02.503 --> 00:22:04.194
TALIESIN: Oh my god! I did!

00:22:04.194 --> 00:22:06.861
MATT: And you look through the pages and there are
sketches you don't remember drawing.

00:22:06.861 --> 00:22:09.391
TRAVIS: Oh fuck! I mean, oh fuck!

00:22:09.391 --> 00:22:11.157
TALIESIN: This is so weird.

00:22:11.157 --> 00:22:14.061
MARISHA: You had a lovely time.

00:22:14.061 --> 00:22:16.917
TALIESIN: This'll do.

00:22:16.917 --> 00:22:19.169
MARISHA: We can go back. We'll take a lovely
vacation.

00:22:19.169 --> 00:22:21.449
TALIESIN: No, no, this and liquor will do.

00:22:21.449 --> 00:22:26.934
LAURA: You used your lightning javelin. You--

00:22:26.934 --> 00:22:29.174
MATT: As you guys approach--

00:22:29.174 --> 00:22:32.502
LAURA: Yes! You have a little statue. You have a
little statue, Grog.

00:22:32.502 --> 00:22:37.343
SAM: Oh, that's right. A little statue of a dog
that might be magical.

00:22:37.343 --> 00:22:40.753
TRAVIS: A little statue of a dog.

00:22:40.753 --> 00:22:42.748
SAM: An onyx statue of a dog.

00:22:42.748 --> 00:22:46.696
TRAVIS: Can I reach into the bag of holding for an
onyx statue of a dog?

00:22:46.696 --> 00:22:52.508
MATT: Make an intelligence check.

00:22:52.508 --> 00:22:55.502
SAM: I've seen it, I can reach in there.

00:22:55.502 --> 00:22:58.844
MATT: One of you guys can reach in there and get
it if you want to. I just want to see if he can.

00:22:58.844 --> 00:23:02.103
TRAVIS: 11.

00:23:02.103 --> 00:23:08.278
MATT: Unfortunately, your lack of imagination is
finding it difficult based on the words you were

00:23:08.278 --> 00:23:12.498
given to formulate enough of a solid creative
thought.

00:23:12.498 --> 00:23:14.612
LAURA: It's black. Onyx means black.

00:23:14.612 --> 00:23:16.858
TALIESIN: Honest statue of a hog. It's an honest
statue of a hog.

00:23:16.858 --> 00:23:19.273
SAM: Doesn't know what onyx is. He's picturing--

00:23:19.273 --> 00:23:21.554
MATT: He barely knows what a dog is at this
point.

00:23:21.554 --> 00:23:26.652
TRAVIS: If you want to reach in here and reach in
my bag. Oh.

00:23:26.652 --> 00:23:30.333
LIAM: Sam, you can do this to me too.

00:23:30.333 --> 00:23:33.126
MATT: And there you have it. The onyx mastiff is
there before you.

00:23:33.126 --> 00:23:41.033
LAURA: It's an onyx mastiff. It's an onyx
statuette of mastiff. If you use an action to

00:23:41.033 --> 00:23:42.406
speak the command word--

00:23:42.406 --> 00:23:43.593
LIAM: Which we don't know--

00:23:43.593 --> 00:23:48.095
LAURA: I know. And throw the figurine to a point
on the ground within 60 feet of you it becomes a

00:23:48.095 --> 00:23:50.309
living mastiff for up to six hours.

00:23:50.309 --> 00:23:53.696
LIAM: I thought the guy told us we'd have to
figure it out. Did he whisper anything to you?

00:23:53.696 --> 00:23:57.797
LAURA: It was etched on the bottom and I totally
understand it.

00:23:57.797 --> 00:23:59.090
LIAM: Oh, you read Elvish?

00:23:59.090 --> 00:23:59.975
LAURA: I do.

00:23:59.975 --> 00:24:00.999
LIAM: You're partially elvish.

00:24:00.999 --> 00:24:02.038
LAURA: It's right there.

00:24:02.038 --> 00:24:02.977
SAM: So wait, it's insta-dog?

00:24:02.977 --> 00:24:03.799
LAURA: It's insta-dog.

00:24:03.799 --> 00:24:06.164
SAM: And then what does it do? Can it fight?

00:24:06.164 --> 00:24:11.807
LAURA: It fights. It has sight and hearing checks.
It bites and it claws just like-- oh, no. It just bites.

00:24:11.807 --> 00:24:13.973
SAM: And what happens if it gets killed?

00:24:13.973 --> 00:24:15.340
LAURA: I'm looking, I'm looking.

00:24:15.340 --> 00:24:17.107
TRAVIS: It has an intelligence of eight.

00:24:17.107 --> 00:24:18.705
SAM: What's your intelligence?

00:24:18.705 --> 00:24:19.749
TRAVIS: Six.

00:24:19.749 --> 00:24:20.865
SAM: Oh my goodness.

00:24:20.865 --> 00:24:24.794
LAURA: The creature reverts to its figurine form.
It reverts to a figurine early if it drops to zero

00:24:24.794 --> 00:24:29.058
hit points or if you use an action to speak the
command word again while touching it. When the

00:24:29.058 --> 00:24:34.571
creature becomes a figurine again, its property
can't be used again for, ugh, seven days.

00:24:34.571 --> 00:24:36.951
TRAVIS: Get to the bottom part, come on.

00:24:36.951 --> 00:24:42.355
LAURA: Mastiff has an intelligence of eight
(laughs) and can speak Common. It's smarter than you.

00:24:42.355 --> 00:24:43.831
SAM: Oh, it's a talking dog?

00:24:43.831 --> 00:24:44.877
LAURA: Yeah.

00:24:44.877 --> 00:24:46.418
MARISHA: I wonder if it has a name.

00:24:46.418 --> 00:24:47.853
MATT: It can also see invisibility.

00:24:47.853 --> 00:24:49.525
SAM: It can see invisibility?

00:24:49.525 --> 00:24:52.507
MATT: That's why it's a good guard dog if you--

00:24:52.507 --> 00:24:54.057
LAURA: And objects within that range.

00:24:54.057 --> 00:24:55.779
SAM: I like this dog.

00:24:55.779 --> 00:24:57.617
LIAM: The only important thing on that paper.

00:24:57.617 --> 00:25:00.859
MARISHA: And how long does he last? He just lives
until he's done?

00:25:00.859 --> 00:25:02.100
TALIESIN: Six hours.

00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:05.057
LAURA: Sorry, I didn't mean to read all that and
make it not interesting.

00:25:05.057 --> 00:25:06.754
TRAVIS: If you set camp though, good sentry.

00:25:06.754 --> 00:25:09.773
SAM: But we need to know the magic word.

00:25:09.773 --> 00:25:12.241
LAURA: We know it. It's good doggie.

00:25:12.241 --> 00:25:15.029
SAM: Oh, we know the word already?

00:25:15.029 --> 00:25:17.148
MATT: It's part of the enchantment, yeah.

00:25:17.148 --> 00:25:18.642
MARISHA: Good doggie.

00:25:18.642 --> 00:25:21.948
SAM: Can you teach us how to say that in Elvish?

00:25:21.948 --> 00:25:23.503
TALIESIN: Don't teach him how to say it in
Elvish.

00:25:23.503 --> 00:25:26.303
LAURA: You can say it in Common. He understands
Common.

00:25:26.303 --> 00:25:27.710
TALIESIN: He understands Common, that's fair.

00:25:27.710 --> 00:25:30.011
LIAM: Vel'ena. Vo'el'ena.

00:25:30.011 --> 00:25:31.055
SAM: Vo'el'el'ena?

00:25:31.055 --> 00:25:32.202
LAURA: Yeah, that's it.

00:25:32.202 --> 00:25:33.692
SAM: Vo'el'la'la'la.

00:25:33.692 --> 00:25:35.687
TRAVIS: All right, we start walking back to
Whitestone.

00:25:35.687 --> 00:25:36.977
LAURA: Grog, I'm sorry.

00:25:36.977 --> 00:25:38.496
SAM: Let's get the dog out here.

00:25:38.496 --> 00:25:40.131
TALIESIN: Let's hold off on the dog.

00:25:40.131 --> 00:25:44.201
MATT: As you guys make your way towards the
castle, there's a small group of figures. You see

00:25:44.201 --> 00:25:53.831
three armored Whitestone soldiers with one figure
following them. Different outfit, looks to be

00:25:53.831 --> 00:26:02.304
simple dark blues and grays. Dark skin, short dark
hair, carrying his crossbow at his side. As you

00:26:02.304 --> 00:26:04.242
make eyes, you immediately recognize this as
Jarett.

00:26:04.242 --> 00:26:05.338
MARISHA: Jarett!

00:26:05.338 --> 00:26:10.219
MATT: Jarett is coming down and he sees. "Aye,
friends, it has been a while. I'm so happy to see

00:26:10.219 --> 00:26:17.508
"that you survived. It's been a while. Is everyone
okay?"

00:26:17.508 --> 00:26:20.575
LIAM: How long?

00:26:20.575 --> 00:26:23.307
MATT: "Aye, most better part of a week."

00:26:23.307 --> 00:26:28.565
MARISHA: So it is like Saturday here, right? Time
runs the same?

00:26:28.565 --> 00:26:30.499
MATT: "Yes?"

00:26:30.499 --> 00:26:34.045
MARISHA: So it wasn't yesterday?

00:26:34.045 --> 00:26:35.925
SAM: Why did you taste the wind?

00:26:35.925 --> 00:26:37.713
MATT: "I don't know why. It's a strange
question."

00:26:37.713 --> 00:26:38.755
(laughter)

00:26:38.755 --> 00:26:40.002
TALIESIN: It tastes like Saturday, certainly.

00:26:40.002 --> 00:26:41.298
MATT: "More confused by the question, but it's
fine. All right."

00:26:41.298 --> 00:26:42.661
LAURA: How are things here?

00:26:42.661 --> 00:26:48.700
MATT: "Well, (sighs) let's just say better for the
time being." And as you look up, what you didn't

00:26:48.700 --> 00:26:54.046
notice before when you saw the clouds is there's
this slight light blue hue to the entire sky.

00:26:54.046 --> 00:26:55.561
TALIESIN: Excellent.

00:26:55.561 --> 00:27:02.874
MATT: There's this very faint shimmer to it. And
he goes, "Ah, the barrier is now up, which is

00:27:02.874 --> 00:27:10.057
"good. As soon as they finished that, Allura, Drake
and Kima all left to find information on the green dragon."

00:27:10.057 --> 00:27:11.366
LIAM: Where?

00:27:11.366 --> 00:27:15.369
MATT: "I did not inquire as to the location, but
they said they should be back in the next few days."

00:27:15.369 --> 00:27:16.753
LAURA: Cassandra might know.

00:27:16.753 --> 00:27:17.644
TALIESIN: She will.

00:27:17.644 --> 00:27:18.766
MARISHA: When did they leave?

00:27:18.766 --> 00:27:24.304
MATT: "It's three days ago? They were hoping to
get insight on Thordak's current situation while

00:27:24.304 --> 00:27:29.218
"we amass as many armored folks here as possible
and continue to reach out for allies. I think that

00:27:29.218 --> 00:27:33.581
"is the main goal right now, is to find as many
allies as we can. It was interesting to put a

00:27:33.581 --> 00:27:35.122
"stake into this fight."

00:27:35.122 --> 00:27:36.848
LAURA: So you're leading an army?

00:27:36.848 --> 00:27:41.971
MATT: "Well, we're building whoever we can in this
vicinity. There's not many. At the very least,

00:27:41.971 --> 00:27:43.740
"defend, in case this ends up falling."

00:27:43.740 --> 00:27:45.188
LAURA: And what's your role in it?

00:27:45.188 --> 00:27:49.598
MATT: Welcome back. Slight little technical issue
there. We're going to roll back in. Little bit of

00:27:49.598 --> 00:27:55.715
information, step into the moment. As Jarett has
walked down the steps of Whitestone and began a

00:27:55.715 --> 00:28:01.309
conversation with Vox Machina about the current
situation here, he says how, "Currently, Allura,

00:28:01.309 --> 00:28:07.739
"Kima, and Drake are off trying to find information
on the green dragon, Raishan, and trying to

00:28:07.739 --> 00:28:14.230
"discover what best can be done regarding the
attack on Thordak in Emon. Here, I am doing the

00:28:14.230 --> 00:28:20.845
"best I can to build what armed forces we have at
our disposal, and we're trying to reach out to

00:28:20.845 --> 00:28:27.644
"bring whatever allies are willing to put their
stakes into this battle. But yes, this is a

00:28:27.644 --> 00:28:32.402
"monumental task based on my own experience, and
I'm doing the best I can. But bear with me, it's--"

00:28:32.402 --> 00:28:34.192
LAURA: We have faith in you, Jarett.

00:28:34.192 --> 00:28:40.965
MATT: "Thank you, I'm glad somebody does. Asum
actually just arrived here. About two or three

00:28:40.965 --> 00:28:42.244
"hours ago."

00:28:42.244 --> 00:28:44.683
LAURA: Yes. We were wondering what happened to
him.

00:28:44.683 --> 00:28:45.963
MARISHA: Haven't seen him in a while.

00:28:45.963 --> 00:28:51.622
MATT: "As were we. Last we heard from Gilmore that
he disappeared with Tofor within Emon after the attack."

00:28:51.622 --> 00:28:53.786
LIAM: Shaun's still in the city?

00:28:53.786 --> 00:28:59.352
MATT: "Shaun is still in the city. I believe he's
actually up meeting with Asum and Cassandra right

00:28:59.352 --> 00:29:00.906
"now in the castle."

00:29:00.906 --> 00:29:03.789
TALIESIN: Let's clean up and head in that
direction, I'd imagine.

00:29:03.789 --> 00:29:07.858
MATT: "Certainly. Well, if you need me, I'll be
around. Just--"

00:29:07.858 --> 00:29:09.060
MARISHA: Jarett?

00:29:09.060 --> 00:29:09.957
MATT: "Yes?"

00:29:09.957 --> 00:29:14.714
MARISHA: Has there been any eyes on the green
dragon here recently?

00:29:14.714 --> 00:29:19.063
MATT: "None of us have seen the dragon. None of us
know its whereabouts, and attempts to scry have

00:29:19.063 --> 00:29:21.652
"been balked. I do not know."

00:29:21.652 --> 00:29:24.919
MARISHA: Okay, thank you.

00:29:24.919 --> 00:29:28.014
MATT: "It's all right. I believe there is
information on the whereabouts of the white."

00:29:28.014 --> 00:29:31.438
MARISHA: Do we know where?

00:29:31.438 --> 00:29:34.402
MATT: "I do not know. That is more for what they
hold at the castle."

00:29:34.402 --> 00:29:35.978
MARISHA: Okay.

00:29:35.978 --> 00:29:38.278
MATT: "Yell loudly if you need me."

00:29:38.278 --> 00:29:39.666
MARISHA: Thank you.

00:29:39.666 --> 00:29:42.306
MATT: "It warms my heart to see you all safe."

00:29:42.306 --> 00:29:43.997
MARISHA: Same.

00:29:43.997 --> 00:29:48.643
MATT: He gives a little salute and a smile, and
continues with the other guards back towards the

00:29:48.643 --> 00:29:54.306
center of the city. As you guys ascend the steps
to Castle Whitestone, you enter the large gates

00:29:54.306 --> 00:29:59.902
that slowly creak open as you come to the familiar
interior. You can hear the voices echoing in the

00:29:59.902 --> 00:30:07.004
distance from the nearby-- what was once the guest
dining area of the castle has now been converted

00:30:07.004 --> 00:30:08.448
into a war room.

00:30:08.448 --> 00:30:13.434
As you approach the outside of the doors, they're
partially ajar; on the inside you can see your

00:30:13.434 --> 00:30:19.970
sister, Cassandra, sitting at a table. Gilmore is
leaned back, arms crossed, tugging on the end of

00:30:19.970 --> 00:30:30.412
his chin goatee, and you see Seeker Asum currently
facing towards Cassandra. They're in

00:30:30.412 --> 00:30:37.825
mid-conversation right now. As soon as you enter
the room: "It is good to know that you all

00:30:37.825 --> 00:30:39.496
"survive, as they've told me."

00:30:39.496 --> 00:30:41.679
MARISHA: Same to you, Asum.

00:30:41.679 --> 00:30:46.291
MATT: As he turns and looks towards you, you can
see the side of his face that has all the heavy

00:30:46.330 --> 00:30:54.335
tattoos now bears heavy acid scars that have
blended the tattoos into the scarring. It's not a

00:30:54.335 --> 00:30:59.536
very pretty sight, but he seems to at least be in
one piece right now. He still has his thick,

00:30:59.536 --> 00:31:04.789
hooded cloak around his shoulders, and where
normally he has a shaved head, some of the hair is

00:31:04.789 --> 00:31:10.029
growing in in areas that can grow hair based on
the damage to this side of his face.

00:31:10.129 --> 00:31:13.904
SAM: What happened to you?

00:31:13.904 --> 00:31:19.840
MATT: "What happened to me is I made out a lot
better than many of the people there that day.

00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:23.667
"This-- I'll take this."

00:31:23.667 --> 00:31:26.024
MARISHA: I'm so sorry.

00:31:26.024 --> 00:31:33.902
MATT: "It's fine. I've had worse. Trust me. Come,
sit." Cassandra sits up. "My brother." She comes

00:31:33.902 --> 00:31:36.218
up and gives you a big hug and holds you for a
second.

00:31:36.218 --> 00:31:40.938
LAURA: Pardon our appearance. And stench.

00:31:40.938 --> 00:31:42.668
TALIESIN: Yes.

00:31:42.668 --> 00:31:43.875
TRAVIS: Do we smell?

00:31:43.875 --> 00:31:46.323
LAURA: We're covered in that black messiness, I
assume.

00:31:46.323 --> 00:31:48.619
TALIESIN: I hadn't even noticed, actually.

00:31:48.619 --> 00:31:55.121
MATT: You do. And it is. Its scent has faded a
bit, but you all still are not in the most

00:31:55.121 --> 00:32:01.238
presentable means. However, the conversation's
dire tone seems to be enough where no one pays

00:32:01.238 --> 00:32:02.614
much mind to it.

00:32:02.614 --> 00:32:06.764
TALIESIN: We were successful. I will let the
others fill you in with some details, although I

00:32:06.764 --> 00:32:14.289
do-- and I'm going to double check, and I'm going
to find the brief letter explaining what I've set

00:32:14.289 --> 00:32:22.224
up with Vex, although it will not have any of the
reason why, but it will have at least the nature

00:32:22.224 --> 00:32:30.778
of what's been done. And we have acquired, well,
Vex. Vex'ahlia, if you would.

00:32:30.778 --> 00:32:32.608
LAURA: Another Vestige.

00:32:32.608 --> 00:32:38.891
MATT: As you pull it out, they all step back.
Gilmore leans forward. "Very good."

00:32:38.891 --> 00:32:41.603
LAURA: I would love for you to take a look at it,
Shaun.

00:32:41.603 --> 00:32:46.764
MATT: "I would love to have a look at it." He
takes it. As you hand it to him, it actually curls

00:32:46.764 --> 00:32:54.630
around the back of his hands and whips back into a
strong, tensile stance, and he-- "That's weird."

00:32:54.630 --> 00:33:02.256
He takes it and starts looking over it as
Cassandra looks back. "I'm glad you're all safe,

00:33:02.256 --> 00:33:09.720
"and apparently named. Welcome to Whitestone, Lady
Vex'ahlia."

00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:11.702
LAURA: Thank you.

00:33:11.702 --> 00:33:16.537
MATT: She takes it, folds it. "I'll have this put
in the books immediately."

00:33:16.537 --> 00:33:19.591
TALIESIN: I appreciate your kind generosity.

00:33:19.591 --> 00:33:23.988
MATT: "I will request more information soon."

00:33:23.988 --> 00:33:27.331
TALIESIN: We'll see, yes. That might be
complicated, but yes.

00:33:27.331 --> 00:33:37.425
MATT: "Anyway, have a seat. Asum, please, inform
them of what you've been telling us." As you all

00:33:37.425 --> 00:33:42.107
find a seat, he sits there quietly, his eyes
darting around in his head, ruminating over the

00:33:42.107 --> 00:33:49.529
thoughts and trying to formulate his presentation.
He crosses his fingers in front of his face.

00:33:49.529 --> 00:33:58.927
"Things are a bit of a mess within the city. None
are allowed to leave. Living under the watch of

00:33:58.927 --> 00:34:07.170
"the wyvern guard, hundreds of lizardmen worshipers
of Thordak have been watching the city from above. Some

00:34:07.170 --> 00:34:12.148
"have tried to flee beyond the walls, but
ultimately end up being returned at the end of a

00:34:12.148 --> 00:34:19.813
"set of talons and not seen again. Thordak calls a
gathering every dusk of the surviving populace.

00:34:19.813 --> 00:34:27.753
"Tens of thousands forced to come and gather at the
center of the remnants of the Cloudtop District.

00:34:27.753 --> 00:34:37.156
"He gloats, instills fear in all that behold this,
and offers forgiveness to those who offer fealty

00:34:37.156 --> 00:34:46.819
"to him. All are to cheer his name, applaud his
statements, and thank him for his mercy. Those

00:34:46.819 --> 00:34:52.570
"that fail to do so are pulled from the crowd by
his lizardmen and devoured by the beast himself,

00:34:52.570 --> 00:35:02.257
"lined up to the slaughter as a show. And there is
laughter from the beast that pushed them into his

00:35:02.257 --> 00:35:10.552
"maw. Most of the wealth of the city is now amassed
in the ashes of the district, forming a massive

00:35:10.552 --> 00:35:18.437
"wall of shiny chunk and coin, like a nest around
the fucking beast. He's enslaved a number of the

00:35:18.437 --> 00:35:23.481
"greatest sculptors of the city to begin making his
likeness in the surrounding stone. They chisel

00:35:23.481 --> 00:35:31.630
"away at the tall, proud walls of the interior,
showing his terrible face where it does not

00:35:31.630 --> 00:35:43.784
"belong. A vain fucker. He's crazy, that one.
What's more dangerous than an intelligent dragon

00:35:43.784 --> 00:35:52.405
"than one who's crazy? I've been keeping an eye as
best as I can. Thordak gives direct orders to his

00:35:52.405 --> 00:35:58.310
"wyvern guard often, some off to communicate, I
presume, with the other members of the Conclave; I

00:35:58.310 --> 00:36:04.815
"know not. I've been stuck within the city. Most
survivors stay indoors. I've been working with the

00:36:04.815 --> 00:36:08.447
"Clasp, believe it or not, to shepherd over a
thousand people below the city streets for

00:36:08.447 --> 00:36:14.519
"protection. The lesser of two evils, to be sure,
but at the very least, at the moment they have

00:36:14.519 --> 00:36:23.117
"nothing to gain by working against us at this
juncture. Naught but six hours ago, the Cinder King

00:36:23.117 --> 00:36:30.208
"was roaring in anger, his cries echoing through
the streets. The people fell to their knees,

00:36:30.208 --> 00:36:38.258
"thinking this was the end. Stepped up from his
volcanic throne, and sent the majority of his army

00:36:38.258 --> 00:36:46.266
"eastward. I used this distraction to slip into the
now-unguarded Lyceum, find a port scroll and a

00:36:46.266 --> 00:36:52.419
"sigil for Whitestone before they returned. Came
here to see all of you alive, so that's the best

00:36:52.419 --> 00:37:03.759
"news I've had in weeks. That's the best I have to
bring you about the current state of the city."

00:37:03.759 --> 00:37:07.208
MARISHA: That's our home.

00:37:07.208 --> 00:37:10.758
MATT: "That's our home."

00:37:10.758 --> 00:37:15.158
TALIESIN: What is eastward?

00:37:15.158 --> 00:37:23.094
MATT: "Kymal. Westruun. Technically, here."

00:37:23.094 --> 00:37:25.904
LAURA: Did you bring any other survivors with
you?

00:37:25.904 --> 00:37:31.716
MATT: "I was the only one who could make it into
the Lyceum unseen. Tofor is still back there,

00:37:31.716 --> 00:37:36.456
"fighting the good fight. She's working with Shenn.
They're trying to get as many below ground as

00:37:36.456 --> 00:37:38.307
"possible, and out of harm's way."

00:37:38.307 --> 00:37:40.612
LIAM: And Greyskull Keep?

00:37:40.612 --> 00:37:43.159
MATT: "I haven't seen it. I've been within the
city walls."

00:37:43.159 --> 00:37:50.383
LAURA: Did you say Thordak's wife? Did I mishear
you?

00:37:50.383 --> 00:37:51.953
SAM: Wyvern guard.

00:37:51.953 --> 00:37:53.761
MARISHA: Wyvern. I heard wife.

00:37:53.761 --> 00:37:56.829
LAURA: Wife and guards is what I heard, and I was
so fucking confused.

00:37:56.829 --> 00:37:58.972
MATT: Sorry.

00:37:58.972 --> 00:38:01.382
MARISHA: Wait, his wyvern guard is often...?

00:38:01.382 --> 00:38:05.616
MATT: He sent a majority.

00:38:05.616 --> 00:38:09.571
MARISHA: Oh, that's still me manufacturing shit.
Okay.

00:38:09.571 --> 00:38:14.362
TALIESIN: We don't know where they've been sent.
We don't know why.

00:38:14.362 --> 00:38:15.760
SAM: Eastward.

00:38:15.760 --> 00:38:17.034
MATT: "That's all I've seen."

00:38:17.034 --> 00:38:18.617
TALIESIN: We need to find out where they're
going.

00:38:18.617 --> 00:38:21.459
MATT: "I had to use that time to get to the
Lyceum. Usually it's too heavily guarded."

00:38:21.459 --> 00:38:24.317
TALIESIN: No, of course. Just making a list.

00:38:24.317 --> 00:38:25.503
LAURA: You've done so much.

00:38:25.503 --> 00:38:31.549
MATT: "I've done so little. There's more to be
done. But the more time that passes, whatever it

00:38:31.549 --> 00:38:34.580
"is they're planning, I'm sure is getting closer to
fruition."

00:38:34.580 --> 00:38:38.413
MARISHA: Do we have any known whereabouts on the
white or the green dragon?

00:38:38.413 --> 00:38:46.476
MATT: He looks over and Gilmore steps forward,
sets the bow down, and says, "First and foremost,

00:38:46.476 --> 00:38:52.096
"this is a glorious piece. I could only hope to
eventually create something of its majesty." He

00:38:52.096 --> 00:39:01.266
hands it over. "A bit creepy in ways, but I think
you'll make good use of it. Once we complete the

00:39:01.266 --> 00:39:07.062
"barrier and put quite a bit of concentration each
day into maintaining it, of which Pike has been of

00:39:07.062 --> 00:39:11.086
"great aid to me, between the arcane and divine
magics, I think we found a fine balance.

00:39:11.086 --> 00:39:20.593
"Hopefully. But anyway, I've been putting the rest
of my energies towards trying to procure this

00:39:20.593 --> 00:39:28.782
"information. The green, Raishan, as I believe
you've told me, eludes my watch, my gaze. There is

00:39:28.782 --> 00:39:37.313
"a lot of protection around that one. I get the
sense that of those in the Conclave, she is

00:39:37.313 --> 00:39:39.524
"probably the most trained in my arts."

00:39:39.524 --> 00:39:42.811
LAURA: She's the one that released Thordak, so
that wouldn't surprise me.

00:39:42.811 --> 00:39:44.694
MARISHA: She's on my shit list.

00:39:44.694 --> 00:39:52.984
MATT: "I think she's on a lot of people's shit
lists. Mine as well. The white, however. I know

00:39:52.984 --> 00:40:01.629
"not its name, but I was able to look towards it. I
was able to find it sitting amongst a large pile

00:40:01.629 --> 00:40:10.346
"of rock and rubble. Looks like a fallen city,
crumbled and destroyed. From what I saw, there

00:40:10.346 --> 00:40:22.521
"were smoldering ruins, toppled landscapes of
buildings and temples, arcane crystals crashed and

00:40:22.521 --> 00:40:29.833
"cracked, deep inside a ravine. There, the white
dragon perched, setting up this slow-rolling

00:40:29.833 --> 00:40:33.533
"winter amongst a shivering horde of dragonborn."

00:40:33.533 --> 00:40:35.884
TRAVIS: Oh, shit.

00:40:35.884 --> 00:40:37.572
MARISHA: What did he just say? What?

00:40:37.572 --> 00:40:40.407
LIAM: Shivering horde of dragonborn.

00:40:40.407 --> 00:40:42.486
TRAVIS: Amongst a horde of dragonborn.

00:40:42.486 --> 00:40:44.324
LAURA: Draconia?

00:40:44.324 --> 00:40:45.982
MATT: "What remains of it."

00:40:45.982 --> 00:40:49.823
LIAM: Fuck.

00:40:49.823 --> 00:40:52.562
MATT: "That was days ago."

00:40:52.562 --> 00:40:54.749
TALIESIN: That's a card we no longer have.

00:40:54.749 --> 00:40:57.528
MATT: "I need to be careful when doing this."

00:40:57.528 --> 00:41:01.400
LIAM: The city was razed?

00:41:01.400 --> 00:41:05.590
MATT: "From what I could see, yes."

00:41:05.590 --> 00:41:08.384
TRAVIS: Did you see any motion? Any slaves?

00:41:08.384 --> 00:41:14.291
MATT: "Oh, yes. There were many survivors, but
they were not in the best of states."

00:41:14.291 --> 00:41:22.623
TRAVIS: This white dragon, does he bring weather,
or any sort of change? It's all ice and snow, yeah?

00:41:22.623 --> 00:41:28.728
MATT: "The very essence of each ancient wyrm, if
you will, carries with it its own element. It

00:41:28.728 --> 00:41:35.205
"slowly transforms the landscape around where it
takes up its new den. If it seems to sit atop the

00:41:35.205 --> 00:41:42.477
"remains of the once-proud Draconia, then it now
falls under the icy grasp of the beast."

00:41:42.477 --> 00:41:45.780
LIAM: And the will of the people there?

00:41:45.780 --> 00:41:49.530
MATT: "I could not look that deep. My apologies."

00:41:49.530 --> 00:41:55.035
MARISHA: Is this just with a simple Scrying spell?
Okay.

00:41:55.035 --> 00:41:57.931
TALIESIN: We must be careful. We cannot let
Whitestone be discovered.

00:41:57.931 --> 00:42:02.891
MARISHA: Yes, and as we've learned before, Scrying
can alert your position.

00:42:02.891 --> 00:42:07.531
MATT: At this point in time, you guys hear heavy
footsteps heading up from the lower floor of the

00:42:07.531 --> 00:42:15.273
castle. You hear two voices shout out, "Lady
Cassandra! Lady Cassandra!" They enter the room

00:42:15.273 --> 00:42:18.957
real fast. You see one man, probably in his
mid-20s or so, sweat pouring down his face, his

00:42:18.957 --> 00:42:25.379
eyes wide. "My lady." At that point you hear,
echoing outside of the castle, this loud,

00:42:25.379 --> 00:42:27.494
piercing, shrieking roar.

00:42:27.494 --> 00:42:29.833
MARISHA: Oh my god.

00:42:29.833 --> 00:42:32.291
MATT: (roar)

00:42:32.291 --> 00:42:33.739
LAURA: Shit balls motherfucker.

00:42:33.739 --> 00:42:38.395
MATT: It's distant, but even at that distance, it
is loud.

00:42:38.395 --> 00:42:42.152
LAURA: Gilmore, does the screen keep us hidden?

00:42:42.152 --> 00:42:50.198
MATT: You look back, and even in his most damaged
state, Gilmore had an essence of confidence, and

00:42:50.198 --> 00:42:58.532
this is a moment where you've never really seen
him so pale. "We're about to find out, aren't we?"

00:42:58.532 --> 00:43:00.588
TRAVIS: I'm going outside.

00:43:00.588 --> 00:43:01.739
LAURA: I'm going outside, too.

00:43:01.739 --> 00:43:05.425
LIAM: I walk up to Shaun and slap my hand on his
forearm and say, what about the bow? Is there

00:43:05.425 --> 00:43:07.096
anything you can tell us about the bow?

00:43:07.096 --> 00:43:10.632
MATT: "In due time. Keep it at the ready."

00:43:10.632 --> 00:43:14.334
MARISHA: I turn to Cassandra. We need to get all
of the citizens underground, immediately.

00:43:14.334 --> 00:43:17.399
TALIESIN: We can't fit everybody.

00:43:17.399 --> 00:43:21.096
MATT: "We can certainly try." She turns to the
guard. "Gather everyone we can. Gather--" And

00:43:21.096 --> 00:43:26.132
there's another roar from outside, this time
louder still. "Go! Now!" Everyone starts rushing

00:43:26.132 --> 00:43:28.545
down the stairs to the outside of Whitestone
Castle.

00:43:28.545 --> 00:43:32.188
MARISHA: I go out and I do a Skywrite in the sky
again.

00:43:32.188 --> 00:43:34.161
LAURA: Wait! Skywrite?

00:43:34.161 --> 00:43:37.105
MARISHA: They already know we're here!

00:43:37.105 --> 00:43:39.854
LAURA: No, they don't! They don't necessarily.

00:43:39.854 --> 00:43:43.737
MARISHA: Making pictures in the clouds right above
the city. It's fine.

00:43:43.737 --> 00:43:46.574
SAM: Maybe not.

00:43:46.574 --> 00:43:50.199
LAURA: I wouldn't Skywrite anything right now,
Keyleth. That screen could keep us hidden. He

00:43:50.199 --> 00:43:51.990
could be searching for us right now.

00:43:51.990 --> 00:43:56.198
MARISHA: And what about the citizens?

00:43:56.198 --> 00:44:01.435
SAM: We'll find another way to alert them. Send
out the dog. I don't know.

00:44:01.435 --> 00:44:02.995
MATT: Are you guys exiting the castle now?

00:44:02.995 --> 00:44:04.176
LAURA: Yes.

00:44:04.176 --> 00:44:07.987
MARISHA: Do it by hand? We might not have that
much time.

00:44:07.987 --> 00:44:13.936
MATT: As you step out into the front open patio
area, just outside of the castle's main gates, you

00:44:13.936 --> 00:44:18.982
look up and that faint blue shimmer that encases--
and you can now see it as a dome, and it comes

00:44:18.982 --> 00:44:26.276
down around, just directly around the city,
closing at the very outskirts of the castle. You

00:44:26.276 --> 00:44:31.840
look in the distance as you see a few dark shapes
growing larger and larger.

00:44:31.840 --> 00:44:33.306
MARISHA: They're coming this way!

00:44:33.306 --> 00:44:34.448
TALIESIN: Hold.

00:44:34.448 --> 00:44:36.556
MATT: I need you to make a perception check, all
of you.

00:44:36.556 --> 00:44:37.852
MARISHA: Fuck!

00:44:37.852 --> 00:44:44.784
TRAVIS: 17.

00:44:44.784 --> 00:44:46.385
SAM: Nine.

00:44:46.385 --> 00:44:47.418
MARISHA: 26.

00:44:47.418 --> 00:44:48.190
TALIESIN: 23.

00:44:48.190 --> 00:44:49.018
LIAM: 26.

00:44:49.018 --> 00:44:49.943
LAURA: 16.

00:44:49.943 --> 00:44:59.843
MATT: All right. Vax, Keyleth, and Percy. You guys
glance off and you can see there are a number of

00:44:59.843 --> 00:45:08.986
shapes. It looks to be probably two, three dozen
large winged entities flapping.

00:45:08.986 --> 00:45:12.860
You can't make out too much of the detail
of their form, but you can definitely see some

00:45:12.860 --> 00:45:17.427
sort of aerial transport with large wings. At the
forefront of them, you see one far larger than the

00:45:17.427 --> 00:45:22.841
rest. While you can't make out the details at this
distance, the one thing you do catch is the bits

00:45:22.841 --> 00:45:27.965
of sunlight that peek through the clouds, hitting
the side of its hide. A bright, piercing white color.

00:45:27.965 --> 00:45:30.943
TRAVIS: Fucking fucked.

00:45:30.943 --> 00:45:38.526
MATT: You see it coasting at an angle around the
outside of the city, making its way very quickly

00:45:38.526 --> 00:45:40.574
towards the outskirts of the town.

00:45:40.574 --> 00:45:45.497
MARISHA: It's Thordak's army. Asum said himself
we're eastward. We're directly in its path.

00:45:45.497 --> 00:45:47.817
TALIESIN: Hold.

00:45:47.817 --> 00:45:50.470
MARISHA: Dragons have truesight. They already know
we're here.

00:45:50.470 --> 00:45:52.686
SAM: Maybe they can't get through this.

00:45:52.686 --> 00:45:55.878
MARISHA: Any second we wait longer, more people
could die!

00:45:55.878 --> 00:45:57.634
LAURA: Send out the guards.

00:45:57.634 --> 00:46:01.237
MATT: The guards are already running down, by the
way, based on Cassandra's orders, and are making

00:46:01.237 --> 00:46:05.317
their way towards the city. You can already see
people coming out of the streets and looking up,

00:46:05.317 --> 00:46:07.940
covering their ears. Some people are falling to
their knees and crying.

00:46:07.940 --> 00:46:08.963
MARISHA: Percy.

00:46:08.963 --> 00:46:10.882
TALIESIN: Pick them up. Keep running until the
moment they can't.

00:46:10.882 --> 00:46:13.882
LIAM: They know we're here. This is not a
coincidence. They're not flying by. They know

00:46:13.882 --> 00:46:15.759
we're here. They know.

00:46:15.759 --> 00:46:21.929
MATT: (whoosh) You now see the dragon and the
flying horde have just come within a mile of the

00:46:21.929 --> 00:46:23.958
southern portion of the city.

00:46:23.958 --> 00:46:24.796
MARISHA: Percy!

00:46:24.796 --> 00:46:25.865
TALIESIN: Wait!

00:46:25.865 --> 00:46:26.696
LIAM: Do it.

00:46:26.696 --> 00:46:27.701
LAURA: No. Don't do it!

00:46:27.701 --> 00:46:28.666
LIAM: They're coming for us!

00:46:28.666 --> 00:46:29.841
TALIESIN: This is my home. Wait.

00:46:29.841 --> 00:46:31.304
TRAVIS: This is his home.

00:46:31.304 --> 00:46:32.607
MARISHA: Percy.

00:46:32.607 --> 00:46:33.808
TALIESIN: Keep moving.

00:46:33.808 --> 00:46:37.772
MARISHA: You have five seconds to come up with a
better fucking plan, or I am doing it.

00:46:37.772 --> 00:46:40.669
TALIESIN: Spread out. Keep moving. Find a
position.

00:46:40.669 --> 00:46:44.407
MATT: Okay. What order are you guys rushing down
in?

00:46:44.407 --> 00:46:47.114
LIAM: What are we looking at from our vantage
point?

00:46:47.114 --> 00:46:52.899
MATT: You guys are looking down at the wide,
60-foot earth path that leads down from the base

00:46:52.899 --> 00:46:55.707
of Castle Whitestone into the city itself.

00:46:55.707 --> 00:46:59.742
TALIESIN: If I'm towards the front, I'm moving
everyone towards the house where we made the

00:46:59.742 --> 00:47:01.714
tunnel that goes underneath the Sun Tree.

00:47:01.714 --> 00:47:03.353
MATT: All right, so we have Percy at the front.

00:47:03.353 --> 00:47:04.956
TRAVIS: I'll be right behind him.

00:47:04.956 --> 00:47:06.286
MATT: Okay, Grog's right behind Percy.

00:47:06.286 --> 00:47:07.509
LAURA: I'll follow behind Grog.

00:47:07.509 --> 00:47:09.659
LIAM: We're up above, though? Or are we on ground
level at this point?

00:47:09.659 --> 00:47:13.149
MATT: You guys are now on ground level. You're
above on the grade that leads down into the city itself.

00:47:13.149 --> 00:47:15.012
LAURA: I pull out the broom and I get on the
broom.

00:47:15.012 --> 00:47:16.325
MATT: Okay, so you're on the broom.

00:47:16.325 --> 00:47:18.267
MARISHA: It's clear they're not deviating the
path.

00:47:18.267 --> 00:47:22.558
LAURA: It's not clear. We could just be in their
way.

00:47:22.558 --> 00:47:23.854
TRAVIS: He said they're curving.

00:47:23.854 --> 00:47:28.493
MATT: They're now curving around the outside of
the western side of the valley.

00:47:28.493 --> 00:47:30.184
TALIESIN: What are you going to write? What are
you going to write?

00:47:30.184 --> 00:47:34.485
MARISHA: I would throw up the De Rolo crest, just
like before. It's a good alert sign.

00:47:34.485 --> 00:47:38.002
LAURA: People would just come out screaming. They
won't know where to go.

00:47:38.002 --> 00:47:41.736
MARISHA: Then come up with a better damn plan.

00:47:41.736 --> 00:47:49.994
MATT: (roar) Echoing through the valley. You watch
as the entire crowd of these entities flies around

00:47:49.994 --> 00:47:57.505
the west side of the city, curves past. The shadow
of the light of the sky, you can see the dark,

00:47:57.505 --> 00:48:04.148
heavy shadow of the dragon and the wyverns pass
over the western side of the city. You can hear

00:48:04.148 --> 00:48:11.702
distant screams as people begin to freak out at
this. It passes over the western side of the city,

00:48:11.702 --> 00:48:13.727
flying right towards the castle.

00:48:13.727 --> 00:48:15.304
MARISHA: Percy.

00:48:15.304 --> 00:48:27.536
MATT: Arcs past the castle, over the forest, and
the entire cluster slowly flaps down and lands at

00:48:27.536 --> 00:48:32.949
the southernmost beginning peak of the Alabaster
Sierras, just north of the city. The dragon

00:48:32.949 --> 00:48:34.560
(crash noise) lands.

00:48:34.560 --> 00:48:38.670
TALIESIN: Alert everyone you see.

00:48:38.670 --> 00:48:39.859
MARISHA: They're scouting us.

00:48:39.859 --> 00:48:41.708
TALIESIN: Tell them to get underground. Tell them
to be silent.

00:48:41.708 --> 00:48:43.286
LAURA: They don't see us, but they know we're
nearby.

00:48:43.286 --> 00:48:44.566
TRAVIS: What direction are they looking?

00:48:44.566 --> 00:48:47.762
MATT: Right now, they're looking in all
directions, actually.

00:48:47.762 --> 00:48:50.405
LAURA: We need to get everybody underground while
we can.

00:48:50.405 --> 00:48:52.195
LIAM: We have time. We have time.

00:48:52.195 --> 00:48:59.158
TALIESIN: Thank you. Find everyone. Tell them,
silence. We still have the cavern we built

00:48:59.158 --> 00:49:01.363
underground. Start making it larger.

00:49:01.363 --> 00:49:02.353
MARISHA: Okay.

00:49:02.353 --> 00:49:03.803
TRAVIS: Shall we scatter? Spread the word?

00:49:03.803 --> 00:49:05.359
LAURA: Spread the word. Tell everyone to get
underground.

00:49:05.359 --> 00:49:06.557
TALIESIN: Under the tree.

00:49:06.557 --> 00:49:10.561
MARISHA: I go to the cavern under the Sun Tree and
I start casting Move Earth and I start clearing it

00:49:10.561 --> 00:49:11.760
as fast as I can.

00:49:11.760 --> 00:49:13.919
MATT: Okay. It's going to take you a while, but
you begin building this cavern.

00:49:13.919 --> 00:49:15.252
MARISHA: As fast as I can.

00:49:15.252 --> 00:49:16.258
TALIESIN: More people.

00:49:16.258 --> 00:49:17.480
SAM: Where are we telling people to go?

00:49:17.480 --> 00:49:18.668
TRAVIS: We're scattering.

00:49:18.668 --> 00:49:21.206
TALIESIN: There's the inn that was broken. It's
got an entrance. They either go there or they go

00:49:21.206 --> 00:49:22.496
underneath the castle.

00:49:22.496 --> 00:49:25.316
SAM: That can hold 30, 40 people?

00:49:25.316 --> 00:49:26.506
TALIESIN: She's making it bigger.

00:49:26.506 --> 00:49:28.106
LAURA: Can we send people under the castle as
well?

00:49:28.106 --> 00:49:29.163
SAM: Okay, under the castle, yeah.

00:49:29.163 --> 00:49:35.206
MATT: You guys all begin scattering, grabbing
everyone you can. The guards are starting to

00:49:35.206 --> 00:49:38.835
gather people, and as you get the word out, people
begin to quiet, holding their mouths. The guards

00:49:38.835 --> 00:49:45.673
are holding people silently. People begin ushering
en masse up towards this giant exodus from the

00:49:45.673 --> 00:49:51.512
city, pouring like a funnel up this walkway to the
base of Castle Whitestone. Keyleth, as you're down

00:49:51.512 --> 00:49:56.163
there, you're pressing. The dirt itself is slowly
molding its way into this large cavern, pressing

00:49:56.163 --> 00:49:59.000
downward further and further and opening, further
down and opening.

00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:02.951
MARISHA: Fallout cavern style. Big, lower, bigger,
lower.

00:50:02.951 --> 00:50:06.847
MATT: You get about three platforms down before
the earth stops responding.

00:50:06.847 --> 00:50:08.696
MARISHA: What do you mean?

00:50:08.696 --> 00:50:09.885
TRAVIS: Fucking ziggurat!

00:50:09.885 --> 00:50:11.052
MARISHA: The fucking ziggurat!

00:50:11.052 --> 00:50:12.911
TALIESIN: Other way, other way!

00:50:12.911 --> 00:50:14.141
MARISHA: I go the other way!

00:50:14.141 --> 00:50:17.636
LAURA: Don't empty out the earth too much, or it
won't support the city.

00:50:17.636 --> 00:50:19.619
MARISHA: Fallout style. Little pods.

00:50:19.619 --> 00:50:23.228
MATT: All right. You start creating all these
various things, and people start ushering in. It's

00:50:23.228 --> 00:50:27.056
getting to the point now where there's so many
people. You hear crying children, families pressed

00:50:27.056 --> 00:50:30.667
in, you're feeling claustrophobic and the room's
getting hotter and hotter the more bodies that are

00:50:30.667 --> 00:50:34.418
in there. You keep concentrating and pushing the
earth out. You can feel the sweat beads pouring

00:50:34.418 --> 00:50:38.357
down your face, concentrating, concentrating. You
hear the crying and sobbing, and people trying to

00:50:38.357 --> 00:50:44.041
comfort those that are freaking out. Every now and
then you hear a distant echoing cry, a scream of a

00:50:44.041 --> 00:50:48.158
dragon in the distance, and everyone in the room
tenses, and the sobbing gets even louder, then

00:50:48.158 --> 00:50:53.707
hushed again with whispering silence. You keep
pushing and keep pushing, opening. You guys all

00:50:53.707 --> 00:50:58.798
begin to gather the rest as you watch, with that
final cry, the dragon and the wyverns pick up

00:50:58.798 --> 00:51:09.762
(whoosh) and swoop towards the center of the
valley, arcing to the west, and do a wide sweep of

00:51:09.762 --> 00:51:16.638
the mountain range. (flapping wings)

00:51:16.638 --> 00:51:18.003
LAURA: Where's Gilmore?

00:51:18.003 --> 00:51:21.876
MATT: Gilmore has been bringing people en masse
down to the castle. You haven't seen him for a number

00:51:21.876 --> 00:51:31.796
of-- probably 15, 20 minutes or so. The dragons
coast around, and begin to disappear in the

00:51:31.796 --> 00:51:45.665
southeastern distance where they came from. You
do, at this point, catch Gilmore, who has moved to

00:51:45.665 --> 00:51:50.651
the top of the castle and is currently, arms out,
concentrating, pouring all the energy he can into

00:51:50.651 --> 00:51:52.225
that barrier.

00:51:52.225 --> 00:51:55.026
TRAVIS: Looks like the spell worked.

00:51:55.026 --> 00:51:58.551
LIAM: Good work. Good work.

00:51:58.551 --> 00:52:05.013
LAURA: Gilmore. Good job.

00:52:05.013 --> 00:52:10.759
MATT: He eventually comes down from the top of the
castle. He is-- eye sockets are sunken. You can

00:52:10.759 --> 00:52:21.246
see he's pouring with sweat. "I'm going to need a
spa day. Because I'm &lt;i&gt;done&lt;/i&gt;."

00:52:21.246 --> 00:52:24.330
LAURA: Where's Pike?

00:52:24.330 --> 00:52:32.989
MATT: You guys find Pike. She, during this whole
period, was over by the temple of Pelor that she

00:52:32.989 --> 00:52:39.907
was helping right and construct. Going over and
finding out where she's been placed, you guys see

00:52:39.907 --> 00:52:44.091
that she's shepherded in a good 200 people into
that temple, and has been keeping them divinely

00:52:44.091 --> 00:52:47.601
protected the whole time. As soon as you approach
the outside, the people begin to slowly disperse

00:52:47.601 --> 00:52:54.826
back into the city. Pike walks out, looking out to
the sky and locks eyes with you. "You're back!"

00:52:54.826 --> 00:52:59.905
Runs up and gives you a big hug. Jumps into your
arms at this point. You catch her, and realize how

00:52:59.905 --> 00:53:02.402
heavy she is with the armor on, put her back
down.

00:53:02.402 --> 00:53:04.809
LAURA: I drop her, because I'm fucking weak.

00:53:04.809 --> 00:53:09.053
MATT: "Guys! Hi!"

00:53:09.053 --> 00:53:11.060
LAURA: You did an amazing job with that.

00:53:11.060 --> 00:53:19.158
MATT: "That was mostly him. I've never done
something like that before. That was-- everything

00:53:19.158 --> 00:53:23.230
"okay in the Feywild? I'm sorry, I lost my
connection. We had to finish this ritual."

00:53:23.230 --> 00:53:24.614
LAURA: No, it was fine.

00:53:24.614 --> 00:53:27.258
MARISHA: Hi, Pike. Sorry.

00:53:27.258 --> 00:53:29.765
MATT: "Don't be. I'm glad you're all okay."

00:53:29.765 --> 00:53:32.301
SAM: Do you remember the Feywild?

00:53:32.301 --> 00:53:35.264
MATT: "Yeah. We were--"

00:53:35.264 --> 00:53:37.051
SAM: Okay. Just making sure.

00:53:37.051 --> 00:53:39.104
LAURA: He doesn't remember, Pike.

00:53:39.104 --> 00:53:40.991
MATT: "You don't remember?"

00:53:40.991 --> 00:53:44.997
TRAVIS: Yeah. Apparently, we went to the Feywild,
and everybody remembers it but me and Percy.

00:53:44.997 --> 00:53:48.446
MATT: "Why is that?"

00:53:48.446 --> 00:53:50.210
LAURA: I don't know.

00:53:50.210 --> 00:53:51.833
TALIESIN: It's funnier that way.

00:53:51.833 --> 00:53:53.857
MARISHA: Maybe you can look at his head later.

00:53:53.857 --> 00:53:55.855
LAURA: Maybe there's a way to cure it.

00:53:55.855 --> 00:53:57.606
TRAVIS: I'm just too smart.

00:53:57.606 --> 00:54:01.452
MATT: She walks up and takes a look at you, walks
up to Grog. Has a good look at the side of your

00:54:01.452 --> 00:54:03.828
head, knocks you in the temple a few times.

00:54:03.828 --> 00:54:05.990
TRAVIS: What do you see?

00:54:05.990 --> 00:54:16.755
MATT: "There's nothing... physical. I'll try a
restoration." She would have, let's see here.

00:54:16.755 --> 00:54:19.712
SAM: Pike stats!

00:54:19.712 --> 00:54:22.613
TALIESIN: I was about to say, you have an Ashley
app. That's so adorable.

00:54:22.613 --> 00:54:24.311
TRAVIS: Don't make me any dumber.

00:54:24.311 --> 00:54:27.241
LAURA: Grog, that's not possible.

00:54:27.241 --> 00:54:32.285
MATT: Yeah, she's going to try Greater
Restoration. Let me check something here real fast.

00:54:32.285 --> 00:54:39.339
SAM: That was not fun.

00:54:39.339 --> 00:54:40.474
LAURA: No.

00:54:40.474 --> 00:54:44.391
MARISHA: Percy, are you sure it's okay for me to
let these people out?

00:54:44.391 --> 00:54:51.951
TALIESIN: Of course it's not, but yes, definitely
let them out. We'll have to make it more secure

00:54:51.951 --> 00:54:53.091
and safer.

00:54:53.091 --> 00:54:55.218
LAURA: I think it's gotten quite a bit away from
us.

00:54:55.218 --> 00:54:59.006
MATT: So Pike reaches up. The gauntlets begin to
glow, and as she touches each side of your

00:54:59.006 --> 00:55:04.636
temples, your eyes close. As some of you watch
this, Grog's eyes flash open, and where his pupils

00:55:04.636 --> 00:55:12.398
and the whites of his eyes were, you now see a
flash of divine golden orange light. As it fades,

00:55:12.398 --> 00:55:17.754
you are slammed with a series of memories that
were previously taken from you, and you recall

00:55:17.754 --> 00:55:19.348
every moment in the Feywild.

00:55:19.348 --> 00:55:22.957
TRAVIS: (surprised noises)

00:55:22.957 --> 00:55:30.560
SAM: I'm sorry! I'm sorry, you didn't get to kill
anything. I'm sorry.

00:55:30.560 --> 00:55:32.167
LAURA: No, he did! He still killed the big bad
guy!

00:55:32.167 --> 00:55:34.318
SAM: Oh, you did! You did, you killed the one
thing. Okay, good.

00:55:34.318 --> 00:55:37.618
TRAVIS: I got petrified!

00:55:37.618 --> 00:55:39.353
LAURA: Yeah, well, stoned.

00:55:39.353 --> 00:55:42.109
TRAVIS: I tried diplomacy! Never again.

00:55:42.109 --> 00:55:44.351
SAM: Lesson learned.

00:55:44.351 --> 00:55:45.714
TRAVIS: Holy shit.

00:55:45.714 --> 00:55:47.662
LAURA: Can you only do that one time a day?

00:55:47.662 --> 00:55:49.428
MATT: "No, I can do it once more."

00:55:49.428 --> 00:55:52.760
SAM: Maybe... well...

00:55:52.760 --> 00:55:56.441
TRAVIS: No, it's okay, yeah! Percy will
remember the nude massage.

00:55:56.441 --> 00:55:59.990
MATT: She walks up to Percy.

00:55:59.990 --> 00:56:01.618
LIAM: Think of what he's losing, though.

00:56:01.618 --> 00:56:03.161
TALIESIN: I'm not losing it.

00:56:03.161 --> 00:56:04.329
LAURA: Potentially.

00:56:04.329 --> 00:56:06.701
TALIESIN: No, because it doesn't matter. It's
there anyway.

00:56:06.701 --> 00:56:08.267
SAM: Actually, I don't know. I don't know.

00:56:08.267 --> 00:56:14.160
MATT: Yeah, you have overlapping memories. So she
reaches up and you bend down. She takes your

00:56:14.160 --> 00:56:22.248
glasses off. Hands them to Vex. Reaches up and
touches the sides of your temple. "Now,

00:56:22.248 --> 00:56:29.618
"concentrate." Close your eyes, and there's a burst
of warmth towards the front of your lobe, almost

00:56:29.618 --> 00:56:35.558
like someone's dipping your head into hot water.
And with that, there's a smattering of memories

00:56:35.558 --> 00:56:40.467
that are rushing into your mind. It takes you a
moment. Your head swims, and you have to almost

00:56:40.467 --> 00:56:44.996
sit down. You almost stumble off your back foot as
your brain now has to reorganize those lost

00:56:44.996 --> 00:56:47.671
moments. Seven days now immediately restored.

00:56:47.671 --> 00:56:49.281
TALIESIN: Seven days, ten minutes.

00:56:49.281 --> 00:56:52.089
SAM: Greater Restoration kills Modify Memory.

00:56:52.089 --> 00:56:56.804
TALIESIN: Oh! But do I remember having the fake
memory? Or do I not remember having a fake

00:56:56.804 --> 00:56:57.703
memory?

00:56:57.703 --> 00:56:59.733
MATT: You would remember the spell being cast. You
remember the fake memory, but you're aware that

00:56:59.733 --> 00:57:00.674
it's fake.

00:57:00.674 --> 00:57:02.351
SAM: And that I did it?

00:57:02.351 --> 00:57:03.250
TALIESIN: Yes.

00:57:03.250 --> 00:57:04.016
MATT: Oh yeah.

00:57:04.016 --> 00:57:05.108
SAM: Fuck.

00:57:05.108 --> 00:57:13.662
LIAM: Just say thank you, Percival.

00:57:13.662 --> 00:57:16.270
MATT: "Did it work?"

00:57:16.270 --> 00:57:27.049
TALIESIN: I give her a big hug. I'm so tired. I'm
sorry. I'm going to sit down.

00:57:27.049 --> 00:57:30.816
LAURA: What?

00:57:30.816 --> 00:57:32.120
MATT: "Glasses?"

00:57:32.120 --> 00:57:35.203
LAURA: Oh, but they're so fun to look through! All
right.

00:57:35.203 --> 00:57:36.619
TALIESIN: They'll give you a headache.

00:57:36.619 --> 00:57:38.586
MATT: She takes the glasses, and as you're
resting, she takes your hand away from your head

00:57:38.586 --> 00:57:40.204
and puts them back on.

00:57:40.204 --> 00:57:43.121
MARISHA: I start slowly releasing people from the
pods.

00:57:43.121 --> 00:57:44.273
TALIESIN: Thank you.

00:57:44.273 --> 00:57:51.463
MATT: People begin to emerge, and where once there
was this air of tension, fear, and desolate

00:57:51.463 --> 00:57:58.510
acceptance of the end, there's laughter. There's
smiles, and even more tears as people begin to

00:57:58.510 --> 00:58:00.446
realize they have another day to live.

00:58:00.446 --> 00:58:09.113
LAURA: Can we tell the people as they come out, I
know you'll want to celebrate, but please keep it

00:58:09.113 --> 00:58:12.087
as quiet as possible tonight. We don't know when
it could be back.

00:58:12.087 --> 00:58:18.354
MATT: There's a stillness and a slow understanding
and nodding. While everyone takes in the

00:58:18.354 --> 00:58:24.696
information, one young woman, smeared dirt on her
chin, dried tears on her cheek, steps forward and

00:58:24.696 --> 00:58:32.978
goes, "Thank you. Thank you." And everyone else
starts saying, "Thank you. Thank you. Thank you."

00:58:32.978 --> 00:58:37.341
This sea of thank-yous begins to spread through
the crowd immediately in your vicinity.

00:58:37.341 --> 00:58:39.990
SAM: Don't thank us. Thank Shaun Gilmore.

00:58:39.990 --> 00:58:41.671
LAURA: Gilmore and Pike. Allura.

00:58:41.671 --> 00:58:49.577
MATT: They all quietly go back to their silence
and begin to slowly disperse themselves throughout

00:58:49.577 --> 00:58:52.895
the city where they were before this incursion
happened.

00:58:52.895 --> 00:58:57.082
MARISHA: I go up to Percy.

00:58:57.082 --> 00:59:00.845
TRAVIS: I forgot that Shaun was Gilmore's first
name.

00:59:00.845 --> 00:59:03.410
LAURA: He was like, who's Shaun?

00:59:03.410 --> 00:59:05.631
SAM: Intelligence of six.

00:59:05.631 --> 00:59:08.808
LIAM: So fucking method. Method, man.

00:59:08.808 --> 00:59:10.072
MATT: Keyleth.

00:59:10.072 --> 00:59:13.410
MARISHA: I hope you know that I would never--

00:59:13.410 --> 00:59:21.842
TALIESIN: Shut up. Thank you.

00:59:21.842 --> 00:59:29.474
SAM: I hope you know that I was only trying to
improve your life with a wonderful happy memory,

00:59:29.474 --> 00:59:35.082
and it was mostly true.

00:59:35.082 --> 00:59:39.514
TALIESIN: I know where you sleep. People work
for me.

00:59:39.514 --> 00:59:48.216
MATT: Asum has caught up to you now as you guys
are walking back to the city. You can see him.

00:59:48.216 --> 00:59:55.182
He's still, eyes to the sky, not truly trusting
this quiet. He goes, "It seems we don't have any

00:59:55.182 --> 01:00:00.977
"time to lose. What resources do you have to fight
back? What have you learned? Please tell me you

01:00:00.977 --> 01:00:02.856
"have better news than I have."

01:00:02.856 --> 01:00:06.974
TRAVIS: Well, we've got a few of these Vestiges, so
we're a little powered up. But we're not quite

01:00:06.974 --> 01:00:12.746
sure what their full abilities are. It's
significant, but we think they do more, we're just

01:00:12.746 --> 01:00:14.321
not sure how much.

01:00:14.321 --> 01:00:15.671
MATT: "What more do you need?"

01:00:15.671 --> 01:00:18.286
LAURA: Can I fly up in the air while this
conversation's going on?

01:00:18.286 --> 01:00:19.236
MATT: Sure.

01:00:19.236 --> 01:00:20.458
SAM: Don't go too high.

01:00:20.458 --> 01:00:21.324
LAURA: Not too high.

01:00:21.324 --> 01:00:22.569
SAM: We don't know where the thing is.

01:00:22.569 --> 01:00:24.437
LAURA: No, I know, I want to go to the very top
where I see the shimmer.

01:00:24.437 --> 01:00:30.167
MATT: Yeah and it's a squat shimmer, not a full
dome and it's like a very extended type dome.

01:00:30.167 --> 01:00:33.660
LAURA: Okay. But it's high enough, that I mean
it's higher than the castle.

01:00:33.660 --> 01:00:38.092
MATT: It's high enough where you can get 
about 80 feet up and you start to see enough

01:00:38.092 --> 01:00:42.463
detail in the shimmer where you're like, "Okay,
I'm getting close."

01:00:42.463 --> 01:00:54.468
LAURA: Okay. The direction that the dragons went.
Is this stupid? Can I shoot my Oracle Arrow in

01:00:54.468 --> 01:00:56.098
that direction?

01:00:56.098 --> 01:00:57.481
SAM: No. Absolutely not.

01:00:57.481 --> 01:00:58.435
LAURA: Why?

01:00:58.435 --> 01:01:00.795
SAM: (high-pitched) Why would you bring attention
to us?!

01:01:00.795 --> 01:01:02.073
LAURA: It's an arrow!

01:01:02.073 --> 01:01:03.490
LIAM: They're long gone.

01:01:03.490 --> 01:01:10.201
MATT: They are gone. The time has passed. They're
miles and miles and miles and miles and miles at

01:01:10.201 --> 01:01:16.050
the speed they were travelling. You're a good shot,
but I don't know if you could arc an arrow that far.

01:01:16.050 --> 01:01:21.894
LAURA: Oh well, I guess that's true. I thought it
was a ten-minute, because it's Fenthras I thought

01:01:21.894 --> 01:01:23.396
it was a long-ass arrow.

01:01:23.396 --> 01:01:24.972
TRAVIS: Can't you tell what direction the dragons
were heading?

01:01:24.972 --> 01:01:30.619
LAURA: Oh! Wait, okay, so the Oracle Arrow, is it
like you fire it, and then it shoots somewhere and

01:01:30.619 --> 01:01:32.439
it sticks there and I can see through it for ten
minutes?

01:01:32.439 --> 01:01:35.912
MATT: Correct. Or see through it as it's fired,
the minute it leaves the bow you can project your

01:01:35.912 --> 01:01:37.993
sight through the arrow for up to 10 minutes.

01:01:37.993 --> 01:01:39.245
SAM: It can't fly for infinity?

01:01:39.245 --> 01:01:42.807
MATT: No. It still arcs like a regular arrow.

01:01:42.807 --> 01:01:46.697
LAURA: That makes sense. I foresaw it just going,
because I thought it was like a special kind of

01:01:46.697 --> 01:01:47.580
arrow.

01:01:47.580 --> 01:01:49.435
LIAM: It's really good for people without flying
brooms.

01:01:49.435 --> 01:01:56.718
LAURA: Right. Cool. Then I'm not going to use it.
Because now I understand how it works. I've

01:01:56.718 --> 01:01:58.246
learned something.

01:01:58.246 --> 01:02:02.753
TALIESIN: What direction were the wyverns
travelling, were they travelling back? Or were

01:02:02.753 --> 01:02:03.711
they travelling along--

01:02:03.711 --> 01:02:04.787
MATT: They were heading southeast.

01:02:04.787 --> 01:02:06.720
TRAVIS: So not back, they came from the west,
right?

01:02:06.720 --> 01:02:10.838
MATT: They swooped in from the west, from that
side.

01:02:10.838 --> 01:02:14.610
TALIESIN: But they originated in the west, and
they are currently travelling southeast?

01:02:14.610 --> 01:02:19.047
MATT: Correct. However, it was Vorugal, it was the
white dragon, which from what Gilmore is saying

01:02:19.047 --> 01:02:22.764
has been roosting over at the top of the ruins of
Draconia.

01:02:22.764 --> 01:02:23.971
TALIESIN: Which is to the east.

01:02:23.971 --> 01:02:27.139
SAM: So this was not the group that had set off
from Emon.

01:02:27.139 --> 01:02:28.186
TRAVIS: To the west.

01:02:28.186 --> 01:02:29.933
TALIESIN: No it's-- Draconia is to the southeast.
Why do I know that?

01:02:29.933 --> 01:02:34.892
SAM: Here, here's the map. We're up here. This is
the group that was coming from Emon. These guys

01:02:34.892 --> 01:02:37.126
came from somewhere over here? Where's Draconia?

01:02:37.126 --> 01:02:42.184
LAURA: Can I cast Primeval Awareness and see if
it's within six miles of us right now, still? Or

01:02:42.184 --> 01:02:43.715
if it's farther away from that.

01:02:43.715 --> 01:02:46.600
MARISHA: I thought that Draconia's on a whole
another continent.

01:02:46.600 --> 01:02:48.704
TALIESIN: Yeah, it is. It's over here.

01:02:48.704 --> 01:02:50.040
MATT: It's over on Wildemount.

01:02:50.040 --> 01:02:54.992
LAURA: I want to see if they're just camping out
around us or if they're going away.

01:02:54.992 --> 01:02:56.604
TALIESIN: Are they going back?

01:02:56.604 --> 01:02:58.809
MATT: Using for dragons, I assume, right?

01:02:58.809 --> 01:03:03.474
LAURA: Yes. It's my favored enemy.

01:03:03.474 --> 01:03:07.270
MATT: Yeah. I would say as part of your Primeval
Awareness--

01:03:07.270 --> 01:03:12.538
SAM: If this is the United States, we're in Maine.
Emon is LA.

01:03:12.538 --> 01:03:19.445
MATT: Yeah. Sensing at this point, with the day of
travel and everything, you have no sense of

01:03:19.445 --> 01:03:21.718
dragons in that direction or anything.

01:03:21.718 --> 01:03:23.711
LAURA: Okay. They're further than six miles away.

01:03:23.711 --> 01:03:31.044
MATT: Yeah, there are minor essences in the
northern area, but nothing beyond what you've

01:03:31.044 --> 01:03:36.673
already sensed in the Alabaster Sierras. Nothing
on the level of strength that the draw of an

01:03:36.673 --> 01:03:39.943
ancient dragon would bring on your radar.

01:03:39.943 --> 01:03:40.974
LAURA: Okay.

01:03:40.974 --> 01:03:49.614
TRAVIS: To answer your previous question, there
are four Vestiges left.

01:03:49.614 --> 01:03:51.524
TALIESIN: That we know of.

01:03:51.524 --> 01:03:59.605
LIAM: There's a dagger, there's a cloak. Armor.
There's a staff.

01:03:59.605 --> 01:04:02.083
SAM: Wait, there's other objects that we
haven't--

01:04:02.083 --> 01:04:03.701
MATT: "All right."

01:04:03.701 --> 01:04:05.542
MARISHA: Four left. Because we have Whisper,
right?

01:04:05.542 --> 01:04:07.333
LAURA: No, no, we don't have Whisper.

01:04:07.333 --> 01:04:09.035
MARISHA: So there's five.

01:04:09.035 --> 01:04:13.802
MATT: "Do we have any other allies, friends,
people who are sworn to aid us and--?"

01:04:13.802 --> 01:04:16.076
TRAVIS: Ooh! Yeah, yeah! Your parents.

01:04:16.076 --> 01:04:17.452
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:04:17.452 --> 01:04:18.617
TALIESIN: That's right.

01:04:18.617 --> 01:04:25.267
LAURA: Technically, the elves of Syngorn are
building an army. However, who knows if they'll

01:04:25.267 --> 01:04:26.711
actually come through.

01:04:26.711 --> 01:04:27.984
TALIESIN: The werewolves could be called upon.

01:04:27.984 --> 01:04:30.905
MATT: "I think they would understand it would do
them well to help what is a threat to all of us."

01:04:30.905 --> 01:04:32.493
TALIESIN: You would think.

01:04:32.493 --> 01:04:34.612
SAM: One werewolf has vowed allegiance to us.

01:04:34.612 --> 01:04:36.251
LAURA: In the Feywild.

01:04:36.251 --> 01:04:39.514
TRAVIS: In another plane of existence, which I
don't know if that's a problem.

01:04:39.514 --> 01:04:41.215
MATT: "Not going to count on that one."

01:04:41.215 --> 01:04:44.451
TALIESIN: It's not as ridiculous as you think.

01:04:44.451 --> 01:04:47.183
SAM: Yes. Your former pals.

01:04:47.183 --> 01:04:50.290
TALIESIN: Whatever remnants of Draconia perhaps?

01:04:50.290 --> 01:04:56.476
MATT: "Wait. So the last time we saw the main
portion, the bulk of Emon's army from Fort Daxio was

01:04:56.476 --> 01:04:59.665
"sent to Syngorn before this attack happened?"

01:04:59.665 --> 01:05:00.591
MARISHA: Yes.

01:05:00.591 --> 01:05:02.149
MATT: "Do we have any knowledge on their
whereabouts?"

01:05:02.149 --> 01:05:03.501
MARISHA: A lot are there.

01:05:03.501 --> 01:05:04.942
MATT: "They're there?"

01:05:04.942 --> 01:05:11.636
MARISHA: A lot of-- at least all of our guards from
Emon are in Syngorn, right?

01:05:11.636 --> 01:05:13.716
LAURA: No. Our guards aren't in Syngorn.

01:05:13.716 --> 01:05:15.526
MARISHA: Not our personal guards, but Emon's
guards.

01:05:15.526 --> 01:05:16.900
LAURA: No.

01:05:16.900 --> 01:05:19.452
MATT: You did see quite a few soldiers from Emon
there.

01:05:19.452 --> 01:05:21.285
LAURA: Oh we did?

01:05:21.285 --> 01:05:22.148
SAM: Yes.

01:05:22.148 --> 01:05:23.095
LAURA: I was distracted.

01:05:23.095 --> 01:05:24.591
MATT: That's okay. You did have a lot to think
about with your dad.

01:05:24.591 --> 01:05:28.986
TALIESIN: They would not answer our call but if
someone has relations with the Clasp, they are

01:05:28.986 --> 01:05:31.229
always an option for manpower.

01:05:31.229 --> 01:05:35.292
MATT: "Well, I have been dealing with them and
definitely-- they're not much of an army, but

01:05:35.292 --> 01:05:40.081
"they're definitely good at acquiring information
and I currently have a few of them trying to find

01:05:40.081 --> 01:05:42.195
"out as much as they can about Thordak."

01:05:42.195 --> 01:05:49.079
MARISHA: There's also the Ashari druids, who will
definitely want to help our cause.

01:05:49.079 --> 01:05:50.510
TALIESIN: This is very true.

01:05:50.510 --> 01:05:54.460
MATT: "That is good to know. Well, any more that
come your way or any possibilities you have to

01:05:54.460 --> 01:05:58.841
"bring more to our cause, please, do so."

01:05:58.841 --> 01:06:06.736
SAM: There's a candle-maker who might help out. I
would put him in the strong maybe category as well.

01:06:06.736 --> 01:06:08.574
TALIESIN: Don't mention that Vex flies.

01:06:08.574 --> 01:06:16.759
MATT: "Good, well keep tabs on those you've found
and any possibilities of others, especially those

01:06:16.759 --> 01:06:23.780
"who have... I don't know, more of these Vestiges
that you speak of, or armies at their disposal.

01:06:23.780 --> 01:06:28.220
"Big weapons, anything. I'll take anything at this
point really."

01:06:28.220 --> 01:06:34.896
TALIESIN: There are options but we need to discuss
what happened today. This changes some things.

01:06:34.960 --> 01:06:40.149
TRAVIS: Yeah, we need more offence, less defense. I
don't know if that will work a second time.

01:06:40.149 --> 01:06:51.001
TALIESIN: You're mad. We need defense. This is not
a site of a victory, this is a site of our end. We

01:06:51.001 --> 01:06:53.830
need bunkers.

01:06:53.830 --> 01:06:59.118
LAURA: Yeah. We need to move everybody underground
the same way we did in Emon.

01:06:59.118 --> 01:07:03.988
MARISHA: I can spend more time fleshing out and
reinforcing the bunkers to make them--

01:07:03.988 --> 01:07:08.131
TALIESIN: I'll discuss a warning system to get
people underground.

01:07:08.131 --> 01:07:12.676
SAM: But when the dragon came here just now, they
saw nothing, correct?

01:07:12.676 --> 01:07:13.948
TALIESIN: We hope.

01:07:13.948 --> 01:07:20.141
SAM: Is there a way that we can spread false
rumors that the city of Whitestone has been

01:07:20.141 --> 01:07:22.521
magically moved to another plane or something?

01:07:22.521 --> 01:07:25.839
LAURA: That's wonderful. That's smart.

01:07:25.839 --> 01:07:30.189
SAM: Some way of getting that word to Draconia or
I don't--

01:07:30.189 --> 01:07:34.636
TALIESIN: Putting the word out that we're other
places than we are. Putting the sound--

01:07:34.636 --> 01:07:36.711
MATT: Asum thinks to himself and goes--

01:07:36.711 --> 01:07:38.561
LIAM: Can't we drop it into the Clasp's pipeline?

01:07:38.561 --> 01:07:42.881
MATT: "I can do that. Definitely. We can find a
way to get that information. There are a number

01:07:42.881 --> 01:07:49.986
"who have sworn allegiance to Thordak and, you know.
Some folks who don't see honor but the necessity

01:07:49.986 --> 01:07:54.068
"to stay alive override any sort of previous
friendships."

01:07:54.068 --> 01:07:58.433
TRAVIS: Best not to mention our name. I don't
think we're cool with the Clasp after our last

01:07:58.433 --> 01:07:59.420
meeting.

01:07:59.420 --> 01:08:00.943
LAURA: Yeah, they don't like us.

01:08:00.943 --> 01:08:05.641
MATT: "Good to know. I'll look about planting that
information. I'll do the best I can in that

01:08:05.641 --> 01:08:11.138
"regard. I've been told that you've already felled
another of the Conclave, is that correct?"

01:08:11.138 --> 01:08:12.038
TRAVIS: Yes.

01:08:12.038 --> 01:08:13.886
LAURA: That's true. Umbrasyl. Dead and gone.

01:08:13.886 --> 01:08:15.955
MATT: "That will certainly stir some attention
from them."

01:08:15.955 --> 01:08:19.115
LAURA: Yeah, and if not that, then the message left
in there.

01:08:19.115 --> 01:08:20.877
TALIESIN: They know we did it.

01:08:20.877 --> 01:08:26.760
TRAVIS: Strange that he had all those wyverns with
him, though. Umbrasyl had none. He was by

01:08:26.760 --> 01:08:27.899
himself.

01:08:27.899 --> 01:08:30.930
LIAM: They don't like each other, though, this is
some sort of loose partnership.

01:08:30.930 --> 01:08:37.212
TRAVIS: Yeah, but didn't they say the white one
was more savage. More emotional?

01:08:37.212 --> 01:08:39.201
LAURA: The white one was more vain.

01:08:39.201 --> 01:08:42.103
MARISHA: Yeah, the black one, Umbrasyl is the one
that's--

01:08:42.103 --> 01:08:46.135
SAM: Oh you're right, the white one is a hunter,
it's primal. Hates others. You're right.

01:08:46.135 --> 01:08:52.441
TALIESIN: Maybe the army's going to head to-- no,
we could be so lucky if it was on its way to

01:08:52.441 --> 01:08:53.645
attack it.

01:08:53.645 --> 01:08:55.087
MARISHA: Black ones like torture, right?

01:08:55.087 --> 01:08:56.672
LAURA: Yeah, they like to make people suffer.

01:08:56.672 --> 01:09:00.619
TALIESIN: I feel like there should be trading
cards.

01:09:00.619 --> 01:09:01.794
SAM: So the white one's like Predator?

01:09:01.794 --> 01:09:03.987
LAURA: Shut up! There's notes somewhere in here!

01:09:03.987 --> 01:09:11.798
MATT: "Just be warned: fell one dragon, that might
make them nervous. Fell another and that's almost

01:09:11.798 --> 01:09:13.463
"certain to bring retaliation."

01:09:13.463 --> 01:09:16.093
TALIESIN: We were hoping to distract them.

01:09:16.093 --> 01:09:19.655
MATT: "Well, the next wyrm you decide to fell will
probably be the start of this war."

01:09:19.655 --> 01:09:23.043
TRAVIS: Can we ask, why would it bring
retaliation? How would they know it was us?

01:09:23.043 --> 01:09:27.138
TALIESIN: We did sign the card.

01:09:27.138 --> 01:09:28.299
MARISHA: We left our names.

01:09:28.299 --> 01:09:29.619
LAURA: Maybe the next one we can sign as somebody
else.

01:09:29.619 --> 01:09:30.892
TRAVIS: What if we don't sign it?

01:09:30.892 --> 01:09:35.502
LIAM: Even if we don't, they probably are going to
get much more vindictive overall.

01:09:35.502 --> 01:09:39.797
MARISHA: And just as much as we can scry on them,
they can scry on us. I'm sure they've been

01:09:39.797 --> 01:09:40.989
watching us.

01:09:40.989 --> 01:09:43.898
TALIESIN: I don't think they know where we are. I
think they know when we travel, I just don't think

01:09:43.898 --> 01:09:45.117
they know where we are.

01:09:45.117 --> 01:09:47.103
MATT: "Have any of the living ones seen you?"

01:09:47.103 --> 01:09:48.532
LAURA: Have any what?

01:09:48.532 --> 01:09:51.046
MATT: "Have any of the living ones seen you and
know you for who you are?"

01:09:51.046 --> 01:09:54.845
TRAVIS: When we killed the first one, there were a
bunch of jewels in the wall and we saw a bunch of

01:09:54.845 --> 01:09:56.072
eyeballs.

01:09:56.072 --> 01:09:57.779
TALIESIN: He did not know our name, but he has
seen us.

01:09:57.779 --> 01:10:00.525
LAURA: Raishan saw us, the white one saw us, all
of them saw us.

01:10:00.525 --> 01:10:02.490
MATT: "Then it is very possible."

01:10:02.490 --> 01:10:07.517
SAM: Wait a second, you just said no one knew we
were here, none of them knew we were here.

01:10:07.517 --> 01:10:08.627
TALIESIN: Here.

01:10:08.627 --> 01:10:11.956
SAM: They just attacked here. And we just got back
here.

01:10:11.956 --> 01:10:18.691
LAURA: Gilmore was scrying on them. It took three
days for him to get here. That's how he knew.

01:10:18.691 --> 01:10:24.890
SAM: Because Gilmore was scrying on them. Got it.
Not because we have a leak.

01:10:24.890 --> 01:10:27.958
TALIESIN: We probably do. We should assume we have
a leak.

01:10:27.958 --> 01:10:31.574
SAM: I'm going to blame Shaun.

01:10:31.657 --> 01:10:34.580
TALIESIN: Is he Shaun now?

01:10:34.580 --> 01:10:37.924
MATT: "You're more than welcome to."

01:10:37.924 --> 01:10:40.519
SAM: Sorry! (chuckles)

01:10:40.519 --> 01:10:43.199
MATT: He's sitting down, wiping his brow with this
really fine scarf.

01:10:43.199 --> 01:10:52.096
MARISHA: Judging based on what happened in Emon,
we know that they have an insider, we just don't

01:10:52.096 --> 01:10:53.469
know who yet.

01:10:53.469 --> 01:10:54.749
SAM: They do? We know this?

01:10:54.749 --> 01:10:57.531
TALIESIN: I would assume that there's nothing we
say that they don't know at this point.

01:10:57.531 --> 01:10:59.471
LAURA: They struck during a political--

01:10:59.471 --> 01:11:00.922
MARISHA: During a council meeting.

01:11:00.922 --> 01:11:03.135
LAURA: Somebody has to be telling them things.

01:11:03.135 --> 01:11:06.637
MARISHA: Someone probably very high up.

01:11:06.637 --> 01:11:09.694
LAURA: It could be Raishan taking the form of a
human again, for all we know.

01:11:09.694 --> 01:11:12.472
SAM: Who was there and lived? Besides us?

01:11:12.472 --> 01:11:16.607
MATT: Jarett catches up, by the way. (panting) "Is
everyone all right?"

01:11:16.607 --> 01:11:21.544
LAURA: Yes. How are the citizens? Did you get
everyone in there?

01:11:21.544 --> 01:11:26.670
MATT: "Everyone seems to be safe and accounted
for. There was a lot of fear, of course, but

01:11:26.670 --> 01:11:31.646
"elation, whatever you did." And he looks at you
and looks at Shaun. "Whatever you did, keep doing

01:11:31.646 --> 01:11:32.854
"it, please."

01:11:32.854 --> 01:11:35.296
TRAVIS: I insight check Jarett.

01:11:35.296 --> 01:11:36.742
MATT: Make an insight check.

01:11:36.742 --> 01:11:40.649
TRAVIS: Seven.

01:11:40.649 --> 01:11:43.997
MATT: It's hard to read that fella. Slippery.

01:11:43.997 --> 01:11:47.959
LIAM: Can I do an insight check on Asum?

01:11:48.036 --> 01:11:49.333
MATT: You may.

01:11:49.333 --> 01:11:53.391
LAURA: What are you doing?

01:11:53.391 --> 01:11:55.515
SAM: Ooh, that was a Luck.

01:11:55.515 --> 01:11:57.012
LIAM: First one was good anyway.

01:11:57.012 --> 01:12:00.717
LAURA: Oh, you're just hoping? First one was
really good.

01:12:00.820 --> 01:12:03.265
LIAM: Damn. I can choose whichever one I want.
21.

01:12:03.265 --> 01:12:04.493
MATT: 21.

01:12:04.493 --> 01:12:09.617
LAURA: About Jarett?! You're insighting Jarett?

01:12:09.617 --> 01:12:12.190
SAM: Seeker Asum.

01:12:12.190 --> 01:12:16.131
TALIESIN: Perhaps we should not have... assumed.

01:12:16.131 --> 01:12:19.334
MARISHA: Hey, Travis! How is it you're on this
side of the table?

01:12:19.409 --> 01:12:22.090
TRAVIS: Well I was looking for a Loot Crate. Have
you guys seen any Loot Crates?

01:12:22.090 --> 01:12:25.988
SAM: Oh! Well I've got some of the great swag that
you can get in a Loot Crate. Why this shirt came

01:12:25.988 --> 01:12:27.445
in one last week.

01:12:27.445 --> 01:12:29.412
TRAVIS: That's incredible! How do I get one of
those?

01:12:29.412 --> 01:12:35.423
SAM: You go to LootCrate.com/CriticalRole to
see your selection and then if you sign up, you

01:12:35.493 --> 01:12:40.331
get three dollars off the first month, which is a
really good deal!

01:12:40.331 --> 01:12:45.440
TALIESIN: Ironically when we played the game at
home this is exactly what we'd do.

01:12:45.440 --> 01:12:47.491
MATT: Totally.

01:12:47.491 --> 01:12:50.303
LIAM: Sam who are you talking to? You're facing a
potted plant.

01:12:50.303 --> 01:12:57.791
SAM: I'm talking to Seeker Asum! He's a big
fanboy.

01:12:57.791 --> 01:13:07.943
MATT: Gilmore stands up and catches the edge of
Vax's shoulder.

01:13:07.943 --> 01:13:10.293
LIAM: Hey.

01:13:10.293 --> 01:13:13.547
MATT: "All right, so, what's your plan? What's the
next order of business?"

01:13:13.547 --> 01:13:15.478
LAURA: Get you a drink, I think.

01:13:15.478 --> 01:13:16.830
MATT: "A drink would be great."

01:13:16.830 --> 01:13:18.360
TALIESIN: I think we talk and drink.

01:13:18.360 --> 01:13:23.244
LAURA: Yes. We need to talk about barricading
underground. Making it more secure.

01:13:23.244 --> 01:13:26.251
MATT: "Come. I can definitely use that right
now."

01:13:26.251 --> 01:13:33.200
You guys are led into the nearest open-- it
looks to be an unused tavern, but there are

01:13:33.200 --> 01:13:38.305
drinks, ale and things that are at the ready.
There isn't much commerce currently happening in

01:13:38.305 --> 01:13:41.901
the city, since right now everything's in survival
mode, so there's no exchange of money, you guys

01:13:41.901 --> 01:13:47.951
are presented with drinks. The lanterns are lit on
the inside from other villagers that are just

01:13:47.951 --> 01:13:53.147
happy to help. And the central table is set where
you all sit around and quietly have a few sips.

01:13:53.147 --> 01:13:56.779
LIAM: While everyone's sitting, can I just pull
him over to a corner for a second?

01:13:56.779 --> 01:13:57.939
MATT: Yeah.

01:13:57.939 --> 01:13:59.722
LIAM: How are you doing, personally?

01:13:59.722 --> 01:14:01.045
MATT: "Me?"

01:14:01.045 --> 01:14:01.727
LIAM: Yeah.

01:14:01.727 --> 01:14:04.656
MATT: "Wondrous! I'm doing great! (chuckles) I'm
exhausted."

01:14:04.656 --> 01:14:07.382
LIAM: Shaun, I--

01:14:07.382 --> 01:14:08.757
MATT: "I'll be fine."

01:14:08.757 --> 01:14:09.649
LIAM: You sure?

01:14:09.649 --> 01:14:10.646
MATT: "Yes, I'm fine."

01:14:10.646 --> 01:14:11.762
LIAM: All right.

01:14:11.762 --> 01:14:17.259
MATT: "It's been a long time since I put my energy
and talents towards anything beyond making shiny

01:14:17.259 --> 01:14:21.799
"things. Feels nice to be helping others."

01:14:21.799 --> 01:14:23.529
LIAM: Well, I feel we're seeing your true
talents.

01:14:23.529 --> 01:14:30.419
MATT: "I'm at my wits' end with these. Do you want
to see true talents? You should ask Allura to show

01:14:30.419 --> 01:14:32.090
"you what she's capable of when she gets back."

01:14:32.090 --> 01:14:34.008
LIAM: She is pretty nifty.

01:14:34.008 --> 01:14:37.713
MATT: (sighs heavily)

01:14:37.713 --> 01:14:39.326
LIAM: Well, come on, come and have a drink.

01:14:39.326 --> 01:14:43.121
MATT: And he like leans on you a bit and you both
make it back to the table. The rest of you--

01:14:43.121 --> 01:14:50.649
SAM: This booze is okay, but Grog, I could really
use the finest wine I've ever had.

01:14:50.649 --> 01:14:52.437
TRAVIS: Oh shit, hold on.

01:14:52.437 --> 01:14:55.275
LAURA: We've got some fancy-ass bottles.

01:14:55.275 --> 01:14:59.644
TRAVIS: I reach into the bag of holding and I grab
five expensive-ass bottles of wine.

01:14:59.644 --> 01:15:00.826
LIAM: Holla!

01:15:00.826 --> 01:15:02.821
MARISHA: Scanlan and I will share one.

01:15:02.821 --> 01:15:04.250
SAM: Good idea.

01:15:04.250 --> 01:15:05.260
LAURA: Just one bottle between the two of you?

01:15:05.260 --> 01:15:07.932
SAM: We don't weigh very much.

01:15:07.932 --> 01:15:09.134
MARISHA: No.

01:15:09.134 --> 01:15:12.939
TALIESIN: I'm involved in this. This is exciting.

01:15:12.939 --> 01:15:18.515
MATT: You guys scatter the wine amongst your
glasses. Drinks are had as you begin to discuss

01:15:18.515 --> 01:15:19.627
the plan.

01:15:19.627 --> 01:15:23.919
TALIESIN: Pour one for the landlord as well. He's
letting us drink our wine in his room.

01:15:23.919 --> 01:15:33.210
MATT: Asum leans in. "All right. So. Vestiges.
Defenses. Allies, what's the next plan?

01:15:33.210 --> 01:15:34.299
"What's the next--"

01:15:34.299 --> 01:15:40.568
TRAVIS: Well, I've a question. If I were to call
somewhere a City of Brass, where would you think

01:15:40.568 --> 01:15:41.724
that would be?

01:15:41.724 --> 01:15:56.735
MATT: Asum goes, "There are cities that use brass
in parts of construction in Wildemount, that's as far--"

01:15:56.735 --> 01:16:02.904
Gilmore leans forward and goes, "No, that's
in the Elemental Plane of Fire. That's a

01:16:02.904 --> 01:16:04.555
"dangerous, terrible place that you should never
go."

01:16:04.555 --> 01:16:06.177
TRAVIS: We were already there once, actually.

01:16:06.177 --> 01:16:10.508
TALIESIN: Terrible dangerous places you should
never go are practically our middle name.

01:16:10.508 --> 01:16:13.641
LAURA: We saw Thordak there, actually.

01:16:13.641 --> 01:16:15.180
MATT: "Oh! Even more of a reason not to go!"

01:16:15.180 --> 01:16:19.627
MARISHA: Well, he's here now, so Fire Plane's
probably safer!

01:16:19.627 --> 01:16:21.702
TALIESIN: She's got a very fair point.

01:16:21.702 --> 01:16:23.879
LAURA: Why do you ask, Grog?

01:16:23.879 --> 01:16:29.727
TRAVIS: Well, look, the Plate of the Dawnmartyr is
in a City of Brass, but I don't know where that is.

01:16:29.727 --> 01:16:32.096
LAURA: I bet that sounds something Pike would
like.

01:16:32.096 --> 01:16:34.979
TRAVIS: Draconia is in Wildemount?

01:16:34.979 --> 01:16:36.649
MATT: "Draconia is in Wildemount, yes."

01:16:36.649 --> 01:16:38.959
TRAVIS: Right. And so is the big white fuck,
right?

01:16:38.959 --> 01:16:42.698
TALIESIN: Yes. Are any of the Vestiges in
Wildemount?

01:16:42.698 --> 01:16:44.714
TRAVIS: The City of Brass?

01:16:44.714 --> 01:16:48.209
MATT: "Whereabouts are the Vestiges?"

01:16:48.209 --> 01:16:51.519
LIAM: One at the bottom of the sea.

01:16:51.519 --> 01:16:52.548
LAURA: One is in Marquet?

01:16:52.548 --> 01:16:55.550
MARISHA: The City of Brass is in the Plane of
Fire. We've covered that.

01:16:55.550 --> 01:16:58.818
SAM: It's not in Draconia? It's in the Plane of
Fire?

01:16:58.818 --> 01:17:01.984
MARISHA: The city is in the Plane of Fire.

01:17:01.984 --> 01:17:03.527
SAM: Correct. Where's Ank'Harel?

01:17:03.527 --> 01:17:09.872
MARISHA: Ank'Harel is on the continent of-- what's
it's called?

01:17:09.872 --> 01:17:16.828
MATT: Gilmore chuckles to himself, "Ank'Harel.
It's been awhile." And looks at--

01:17:16.828 --> 01:17:19.108
MARISHA: What's the continent? I suddenly blanked
on it. You just said it.

01:17:19.108 --> 01:17:20.048
MATT: Marquet.

01:17:20.048 --> 01:17:21.757
MARISHA: Marquet. It's on the continent of
Marquet.

01:17:21.757 --> 01:17:29.502
MATT: Ank'Harel is also where Jarett is from,
which is where you first heard. Gilmore smiles.

01:17:29.502 --> 01:17:32.913
"It's where I grew up, or nearabouts, at least."

01:17:32.913 --> 01:17:34.713
SAM: Where you grew up, Gilmore?

01:17:34.713 --> 01:17:36.642
MATT: "Well, not in the city, a little ways out a
bit."

01:17:36.642 --> 01:17:38.027
SAM: You're Marquatian?

01:17:38.027 --> 01:17:43.022
MATT: "Originally, yes, but I've been living here
most of my life. Soon as I had the opportunity to

01:17:43.022 --> 01:17:50.315
"leave-- It's a free plane here in Tal'Dorei and
all the shops I can muster... until they all got

01:17:50.315 --> 01:17:51.543
"destroyed."

01:17:51.543 --> 01:17:52.720
LAURA: Good times.

01:17:52.720 --> 01:18:00.644
MATT: "It's fine. I'd made the bottom floors too
small anyway. More space. Next time."

01:18:00.644 --> 01:18:02.477
LIAM: You ever want to revisit home?

01:18:02.477 --> 01:18:11.155
MATT: "Maybe. Nah. I need to stay here and
maintain this."

01:18:11.155 --> 01:18:13.265
LAURA: Yes you do. If you don't mind.

01:18:13.265 --> 01:18:19.058
SAM: What about the endless maze of the Abyss?
That's another place that we're supposed to go.

01:18:19.058 --> 01:18:20.995
MARISHA: Also another plane of existence.

01:18:20.995 --> 01:18:28.068
MATT: "I don't know much about the Abyss, but I
know that it's probably the worst place ever."

01:18:28.068 --> 01:18:29.571
LAURA: Abyssal. That's where demons come from.

01:18:29.571 --> 01:18:30.964
TRAVIS: Worse than the Fire Plane?

01:18:30.964 --> 01:18:32.067
MATT: "That's correct."

01:18:32.067 --> 01:18:33.207
LAURA: That's the thing that killed Pike.

01:18:33.207 --> 01:18:36.268
TRAVIS: Wait, isn't that where the rakshasa's
going to be?

01:18:36.268 --> 01:18:37.845
MARISHA: That's in the Nine Hells.

01:18:37.845 --> 01:18:39.057
LIAM: He's a devil.

01:18:39.057 --> 01:18:41.136
TALIESIN: Ironically is somewhere else entirely.

01:18:41.136 --> 01:18:50.945
LIAM: And I think we can table Meowmix for a
little bit. Somebody told us it takes a while.

01:18:50.945 --> 01:18:52.859
LAURA: Months and months.

01:18:52.859 --> 01:18:55.477
MARISHA: Months but we also don't want to wait
until--

01:18:55.477 --> 01:18:56.400
LIAM: Not forever.

01:18:56.400 --> 01:18:57.775
TRAVIS: Who's got a map?

01:18:57.775 --> 01:19:00.829
SAM: I've got a map.

01:19:00.829 --> 01:19:03.750
TRAVIS: Where's the Ozmit Sea?

01:19:03.750 --> 01:19:07.808
TALIESIN: Before we even think of this, we should
see what we're-- I don't think we're going to

01:19:07.808 --> 01:19:14.161
collect all of the Vestiges. We should see what
other Vestiges we think are going to be helpful.

01:19:14.161 --> 01:19:15.868
SAM: It's like the Pacific Ocean.

01:19:15.868 --> 01:19:18.897
TRAVIS: Which direction is it? Towards Draconia?

01:19:18.897 --> 01:19:22.967
SAM: No. Draconia's across the Atlantic Ocean in
France.

01:19:22.967 --> 01:19:31.232
MARISHA: But the Ozmit Sea is where the Water
Ashari reside. And I have to go there anyway. It's

01:19:31.232 --> 01:19:34.382
also where Pike is very familiar. I'm pretty sure
that's the sea that she sailed?

01:19:34.382 --> 01:19:37.751
LIAM: And the Vestige there is the staff?

01:19:37.751 --> 01:19:38.879
LAURA: Whisper, right?

01:19:38.879 --> 01:19:39.883
SAM: Whisper, the blade.

01:19:39.883 --> 01:19:40.720
MARISHA: Whisper, the blade.

01:19:40.720 --> 01:19:45.834
TRAVIS: Well, look, hey, so I have an idea, right.
Someone mentioned that the white dragon is very

01:19:45.834 --> 01:19:51.458
vain and very savage. He's got like all those
wyverns around him. That's a little bit of a bitch

01:19:51.458 --> 01:19:58.234
for us. We're usually good one dragon on all of
us. You got a whole gang, worse for us. So what

01:19:58.234 --> 01:20:07.455
about if we played to his vanity, and maybe sent
him knocking on one of his Conclave brother's

01:20:07.455 --> 01:20:11.340
doors. Maybe start a little beef that maybe's not
there.

01:20:11.340 --> 01:20:13.784
SAM: How do we do that?

01:20:13.838 --> 01:20:17.103
TRAVIS: I don't know, the idea just popped up. I'm
looking for your help and shit.

01:20:17.103 --> 01:20:24.244
LIAM: He's a big picture man. Here's the detail
fellow.

01:20:24.244 --> 01:20:25.992
TRAVIS: You know how tired I am right now?

01:20:25.992 --> 01:20:27.220
LAURA: We're so tired.

01:20:27.220 --> 01:20:30.577
TALIESIN: I think that we've been thinking about
this the wrong way. I think that we've been

01:20:30.577 --> 01:20:35.518
treating this as a battle. And we have to start
treating this like a war, which is a very

01:20:35.518 --> 01:20:37.059
different creature.

01:20:37.059 --> 01:20:38.608
SAM: Are we guerrillas?

01:20:38.608 --> 01:20:42.191
TALIESIN: We are absolutely not.

01:20:42.191 --> 01:20:43.504
LIAM: Beret.

01:20:43.504 --> 01:20:44.612
TRAVIS: Wolverines!

01:20:44.612 --> 01:20:52.685
TALIESIN: We need to reinforce this city not as a
final stand, but as a place where there might be

01:20:52.685 --> 01:20:58.850
survivors. Because if they come here, there's no
battle to be fought. It's just a loss.

01:20:58.850 --> 01:21:00.103
LAURA: We need to take it--

01:21:00.103 --> 01:21:01.113
MARISHA: Elsewhere.

01:21:01.113 --> 01:21:07.880
MATT: At this point Jarett steps out from back of
the room and says, "The more time that goes by,

01:21:07.880 --> 01:21:14.792
"the more chance there is that the battle, the war,
will be fought here. On our turf. The faster we

01:21:14.792 --> 01:21:21.433
"move, the better chance we have of bringing it to
theirs, so let us not dilly-dally."

01:21:21.433 --> 01:21:28.695
MARISHA: You mentioned about having our own mole
at one point. Our own inside man.

01:21:28.695 --> 01:21:29.974
TRAVIS: Yeah. Scanlan.

01:21:29.974 --> 01:21:35.667
SAM: I'm not going to volunteer myself as a slave
to the dragon.

01:21:35.667 --> 01:21:38.642
TRAVIS: Keep thinking about it.

01:21:38.642 --> 01:21:40.385
LIAM: You are a sexy dinosaur.

01:21:40.385 --> 01:21:45.152
SAM: I'm considering it.

01:21:45.152 --> 01:21:47.953
TRAVIS: You'll be the Hercules Mulligan of Vox
Machina.

01:21:47.953 --> 01:21:49.569
ALL: Hercules Mulligan!

01:21:49.569 --> 01:21:57.357
TALIESIN: I would like to talk to some of the
magic users about installing some sort of-- or

01:21:57.357 --> 01:22:07.303
perhaps helping me install a non-magical dragon
raid signal so that the population knows to be

01:22:07.303 --> 01:22:14.722
quiet, and knows to quietly go underground. In the
event of the next fly-by.

01:22:14.722 --> 01:22:18.656
MATT: They all look at each other and Gilmore
nods. "That's actually, I wouldn't say

01:22:18.656 --> 01:22:22.132
"rudimentary, but it's definitely within my skill
set."

01:22:22.132 --> 01:22:25.325
TALIESIN: Would triggering it possibly alert them
to our existence? Does it make holding up the

01:22:25.325 --> 01:22:26.547
shield--

01:22:26.547 --> 01:22:28.967
MATT: "Not if I can maintain it underneath the
barrier."

01:22:28.967 --> 01:22:31.722
SAM: Does the barrier block sound and visuals?

01:22:31.722 --> 01:22:33.341
MATT: "It should."

01:22:33.341 --> 01:22:38.801
SAM: And is there any way that we can help you
make this barrier more permanent and stronger?

01:22:38.801 --> 01:22:43.157
MATT: "I don't know. This was crafted for this
reason. This isn't a long standing existing

01:22:43.157 --> 01:22:49.091
"incantation. This was crafted through the minds of
Drake Thunderbrand and Allura and myself and

01:22:49.091 --> 01:22:55.334
"Pike's aid. This is a new magic, it's
experimental, and to be perfectly honest, I'm very

01:22:55.334 --> 01:22:57.535
"glad it succeeded because I was--"

01:22:57.535 --> 01:22:59.110
LAURA: Just guessing?

01:22:59.110 --> 01:23:00.870
MATT: "Essentially."

01:23:00.870 --> 01:23:07.243
LIAM: Also, Gilmore, as a sidebar, what about that
black ball beneath the city? Has anything been

01:23:07.243 --> 01:23:08.735
learned of it?

01:23:08.735 --> 01:23:10.523
MATT: "We've been a bit distracted."

01:23:10.523 --> 01:23:11.779
LIAM: That's what I thought.

01:23:11.779 --> 01:23:14.779
TALIESIN: I would like to put it to use.

01:23:14.779 --> 01:23:16.031
LAURA: Wait, what?

01:23:16.031 --> 01:23:17.129
TALIESIN: We're at war.

01:23:17.129 --> 01:23:20.404
LAURA: We can't move it.

01:23:20.404 --> 01:23:21.854
TALIESIN: We're not going to move it.

01:23:21.854 --> 01:23:23.956
SAM: We're going inside it.

01:23:23.956 --> 01:23:30.497
TALIESIN: I want to put the private council table
in the room with it.

01:23:30.497 --> 01:23:32.443
SAM: In the room where it happens?

01:23:32.443 --> 01:23:34.933
LAURA: So they can't scry into the room, it
cancels all magic.

01:23:34.933 --> 01:23:40.883
TALIESIN: So no glamor will survive, no magic will
survive, no trick can be allowed.

01:23:40.883 --> 01:23:45.506
MATT: "I love your mind, Percy. Have I told you
that? I love your mind. I love it."

01:23:45.506 --> 01:23:48.750
TALIESIN: That's probably a bad sign, but thank
you.

01:23:48.750 --> 01:23:50.701
MATT: "We'll do that immediately. It sounds like a
grand plan."

01:23:50.701 --> 01:23:53.868
Asum says, "Not a worry. We'll do that
immediately."

01:23:53.868 --> 01:23:58.084
SAM: We'll just have to Seeker Asum that it
happened?

01:23:58.084 --> 01:24:01.134
(laughter)

01:24:01.134 --> 01:24:09.211
TALIESIN: We should move quickly. We should pick a
couple of Vestiges and move quickly, collect them.

01:24:09.211 --> 01:24:14.399
Start finding more allies, move quickly. But we
should not dally too long.

01:24:14.399 --> 01:24:20.114
MARISHA: And I agree, we might not be able to wait
to get them all before we start taking on dragons.

01:24:20.114 --> 01:24:21.731
We might want to do both.

01:24:21.731 --> 01:24:25.805
MATT: Jarett says, "If you're looking to go to the
Ozmit Sea, you'll probably need a ship of some

01:24:25.805 --> 01:24:30.474
"kind. It's quite a far travel and that distance as
well and the docks on the west coast right now

01:24:30.474 --> 01:24:32.536
"are, well they're locked down at Emon."

01:24:32.536 --> 01:24:33.971
TALIESIN: Could Cabal's Ruin--

01:24:33.971 --> 01:24:35.429
LAURA: How long is the travel to Marquet?

01:24:35.429 --> 01:24:48.223
MATT: "Travel by boat, across the Ozmit, maybe
about a week, a week and a half. Skyship, maybe

01:24:48.223 --> 01:24:49.361
"half as long."

01:24:49.361 --> 01:24:50.845
SAM: Airship. Airship. Airship?!

01:24:50.845 --> 01:24:58.951
MATT: Gilmore actually steps in and is like,
"Technically, I have a teleportation sigil outside

01:24:58.951 --> 01:25:01.247
"the city. I could probably just get you there."

01:25:01.247 --> 01:25:04.468
SAM: Wait, to go to where? Marquet?

01:25:04.468 --> 01:25:07.495
LIAM: Walking is really good for the health
though.

01:25:07.495 --> 01:25:10.043
MARISHA: And first level characters, which we are
not.

01:25:10.043 --> 01:25:13.391
SAM: Hold on. Before we decide that Marquet is the
thing.

01:25:13.391 --> 01:25:16.498
TALIESIN: It's Cabal's Ruin, correct? We're going
to search for Cabal's Ruin.

01:25:16.498 --> 01:25:22.526
TRAVIS: Are we at all just forgetting the fact
that Draconia is lying in ruins?

01:25:22.526 --> 01:25:25.154
TALIESIN: We don't have time.

01:25:25.154 --> 01:25:30.377
LAURA: No, it's not about time. The dragon is
sitting on top of Draconia.

01:25:30.377 --> 01:25:31.777
SAM: So we know where to find him to kill him.

01:25:31.777 --> 01:25:35.960
LAURA: Unless we know how to take on that dragon,
we can't save anyone.

01:25:35.960 --> 01:25:37.625
SAM: wE've killed dragons before.

01:25:37.625 --> 01:25:42.061
TALIESIN: I will feel better with one or two more
Vestiges in our pocket.

01:25:42.061 --> 01:25:45.518
LIAM: By the skin of our teeth, Scanlan. By the
skin of its gut.

01:25:45.518 --> 01:25:47.231
TALIESIN: We got lucky.

01:25:47.231 --> 01:25:50.311
SAM: I like Grog's idea. Is there a way to explore
that any further?

01:25:50.311 --> 01:25:52.057
MARISHA: Pitting the dragons against each other?

01:25:52.057 --> 01:25:53.116
SAM: Yes!

01:25:53.116 --> 01:25:54.440
TALIESIN: I think it's a great idea worth
exploring.

01:25:54.440 --> 01:25:56.629
LIAM: Seeker Asum is on it. He said that he was
going to--

01:25:56.629 --> 01:26:04.616
SAM: Seeker Asum is great, but we're the best in
the business. I wouldn't leave our plan A to

01:26:04.616 --> 01:26:07.182
someone not us.

01:26:07.182 --> 01:26:10.716
LAURA: Seeker Asum is telling people that this
city has been magicked away.

01:26:10.716 --> 01:26:12.965
MATT: Asum is also still at the table.

01:26:12.965 --> 01:26:14.424
MARISHA: Yeah, he's right there.

01:26:14.424 --> 01:26:19.843
TALIESIN: We're drunk, we will talk about you 
in third person as much as we want.

01:26:19.897 --> 01:26:23.093
LAURA: We're just reiterating the things that you
told us you were going to say.

01:26:23.093 --> 01:26:24.462
MATT: "That's all right."

01:26:24.462 --> 01:26:26.943
TALIESIN: We figured you would speak up if you had
issue.

01:26:26.943 --> 01:26:29.116
LAURA: Plus it's really fun to say your name.

01:26:29.116 --> 01:26:31.437
MATT: "Never heard it before, I assure you."

01:26:31.437 --> 01:26:35.872
TRAVIS: How far away is Draconia from here? Travel
wise?

01:26:35.872 --> 01:26:43.345
MATT: "Well, my usual travel to Wildemount is
across the northern channel here. I'd say you're

01:26:43.345 --> 01:26:48.955
"looking at about two weeks of travel by ship
across the Lucidian Ocean."

01:26:48.955 --> 01:26:55.502
MARISHA: Or we can always teleport. I can Tree
Stride. I can always Tree Stride.

01:26:55.502 --> 01:26:57.352
SAM: Have you been to Draconia?

01:26:57.352 --> 01:26:59.542
MARISHA: I can scry and look at a tree.

01:26:59.542 --> 01:27:01.514
MATT: Tree Stride is a short distance. You mean
Transport via Plants.

01:27:01.514 --> 01:27:09.470
MARISHA: Whatever. They all sound the same. I can
scry, look at a tree, and then we go through that tree.

01:27:09.470 --> 01:27:10.993
SAM: If there's any trees left.

01:27:10.993 --> 01:27:12.435
LAURA: There's definitely at least--

01:27:12.435 --> 01:27:14.540
MARISHA: I'm hoping there's a tree on that
continent.

01:27:14.540 --> 01:27:17.671
LIAM: Are we talking though about how scrying is a
little dangerous right now?

01:27:17.671 --> 01:27:19.599
MARISHA: When you're scrying on dragon.

01:27:19.599 --> 01:27:21.314
LAURA: When you're scrying on a tree.

01:27:21.314 --> 01:27:24.111
MARISHA: Yeah, the tree doesn't know it's being
spied on.

01:27:24.111 --> 01:27:28.485
TRAVIS: Doesn't Draconia have an army there? If
there are any survivors, anyone we can bring back

01:27:28.485 --> 01:27:31.756
to Whitestone, shouldn't we be accumulating those
people?

01:27:31.756 --> 01:27:36.677
TALIESIN: I think if there's a dragon sitting on
top of them, removing people from him is--

01:27:36.677 --> 01:27:39.293
TRAVIS: We're sneaky, we're so sneaky!

01:27:39.293 --> 01:27:40.647
LAURA: Are we sneaky?

01:27:40.647 --> 01:27:42.046
TRAVIS: Yeah! Pike's not even here.

01:27:42.046 --> 01:27:48.952
LAURA: You have your memories of the Feywild, do
you remember sloshing around in that black sludge?

01:27:48.952 --> 01:27:50.818
Very loudly?

01:27:50.818 --> 01:27:55.081
MARISHA: Do you remember us walking into the town
center to kill Kevdak? That wasn't sneaky.

01:27:55.081 --> 01:27:58.468
TRAVIS: No, no that was personal.

01:27:58.468 --> 01:28:00.892
TALIESIN: Grog, I think you're thinking of a
battle we can win, as opposed to a war we're

01:28:00.892 --> 01:28:01.913
losing.

01:28:01.913 --> 01:28:06.096
TRAVIS: Yeah, no, look I'm not trying to pick a
fight with a dragon, I'm just going to make sure

01:28:06.096 --> 01:28:09.956
that dragonborn are there and we can help them.

01:28:09.956 --> 01:28:12.523
TALIESIN: We can help them by killing the dragon.

01:28:12.523 --> 01:28:14.075
LIAM: Yes.

01:28:14.075 --> 01:28:15.228
TRAVIS: Wow.

01:28:15.228 --> 01:28:16.666
TALIESIN: Vax is agreeing with me.

01:28:16.666 --> 01:28:21.400
MATT: "Actually that's pretty sound. If you manage
to defeat the dragon there, you'll probably gather

01:28:21.400 --> 01:28:25.411
"the survivors and have them join the cause against
Emon. If you have means of transporting them.

01:28:25.411 --> 01:28:27.491
"Remember, once a dragon is down, it's--"

01:28:27.491 --> 01:28:29.226
LAURA: It's on.

01:28:29.226 --> 01:28:30.234
MATT: "It's on."

01:28:30.234 --> 01:28:32.626
SAM: Grog is the best thinker.

01:28:32.626 --> 01:28:38.309
MARISHA: Yeah. We pull the trigger on one, we pull
the trigger on all of them.

01:28:38.309 --> 01:28:40.302
LAURA: I can't believe if we fight one that means
we have to fight--

01:28:40.302 --> 01:28:43.994
TRAVIS: Well, listen. Again, I'm not trying to
kill the white dragon.

01:28:43.994 --> 01:28:46.497
TALIESIN: What is the white dragon going to do--

01:28:46.497 --> 01:28:49.657
TRAVIS: I want him to go pick a fight with the
other dragons.

01:28:49.657 --> 01:28:51.379
LAURA: How are we going to do that, though?

01:28:51.379 --> 01:28:55.481
LIAM: We're working on that as a side venture.
What are we going to do there to make that

01:28:55.536 --> 01:28:56.390
happen?

01:28:56.390 --> 01:28:58.111
MARISHA: We can't really stroll up to it and be
like--

01:28:58.111 --> 01:29:04.632
TRAVIS: You guys don't know how to pick a fight?
You honestly can't brainstorm one way to pick a fight?

01:29:04.632 --> 01:29:09.602
MARISHA: We are very good at picking fights. It's
getting the dragons to pick fights on others.

01:29:09.602 --> 01:29:12.994
SAM: We can probably plan a ruse.

01:29:12.994 --> 01:29:14.511
LAURA: Oh, and how would you do it, Grog?

01:29:14.511 --> 01:29:24.829
TRAVIS: I would talk mad shit to the white dragon
on behalf of the green dragon. I would rep the

01:29:24.829 --> 01:29:26.126
green dragon.

01:29:26.126 --> 01:29:28.574
LAURA: Oh my god, Grog, he will never see through
that! That's brilliant.

01:29:28.574 --> 01:29:33.085
LIAM: You are really strong. That's the end of it,
I have nothing else to say.

01:29:33.085 --> 01:29:39.489
TRAVIS: I'm just saying, I feel like an
opportunity's being wasted here.

01:29:39.489 --> 01:29:42.094
TALIESIN: I think an opportunity's being tabled
briefly.

01:29:42.094 --> 01:29:43.820
MARISHA: We've got to think about it.

01:29:43.820 --> 01:29:47.486
TALIESIN: I don't think this is nearly as time
sensitive.

01:29:47.486 --> 01:29:49.328
TRAVIS: Fine. Someone else do the thinking.

01:29:49.328 --> 01:29:54.845
MARISHA: Breeding hostility between the two is
something that could take weeks, which we don't have.

01:29:54.845 --> 01:29:59.007
TALIESIN: Well, we could start it. It's also
something other people can do while we do other things.

01:29:59.007 --> 01:30:01.855
LIAM: Yes. Delegate.

01:30:01.855 --> 01:30:05.922
MARISHA: But how? It literally involves going to
one dragon and saying: Hey, did you hear what that

01:30:05.922 --> 01:30:08.044
other dragon said about you? That's all I got.

01:30:08.044 --> 01:30:16.009
TALIESIN: Well, there are other ways to do it. In
traditional warfare, you can do things like cause

01:30:16.009 --> 01:30:22.396
damage to the property of one dragon and leave
scant evidence that the other dragon, or one of

01:30:22.396 --> 01:30:29.754
the dragon's people, was somehow responsible. Have
a raiding, somehow get wyverns to raid near--

01:30:29.754 --> 01:30:32.805
MARISHA: Wait, hang on. That first thing you
said.

01:30:32.805 --> 01:30:34.993
TALIESIN: Yes. It's the easiest level.

01:30:34.993 --> 01:30:40.714
MARISHA: I think I might have an idea. Okay, we
know the white dragon is vain.

01:30:40.714 --> 01:30:42.841
LAURA: Right? We know that?

01:30:42.841 --> 01:30:49.565
MATT: All dragons to an extent are vain. It's part
of the nature of the chromatics.

01:30:49.565 --> 01:30:51.406
SAM: White dragon loves the thrill of the hunt.

01:30:51.406 --> 01:30:56.842
MATT: The white dragon is the most comparably
primal. They're all in various stages of

01:30:56.842 --> 01:31:01.089
hyperintelligence. The white dragon is the one
that's the most... beastlike.

01:31:01.089 --> 01:31:07.394
TALIESIN: If the white dragon is a hunter, the
easiest way to incite damage is to sneak into the

01:31:07.394 --> 01:31:12.811
city and start mauling and killing Draconians that
are left over, and just leaving bodies everywhere

01:31:12.811 --> 01:31:14.624
that he wasn't responsible for.

01:31:14.624 --> 01:31:18.409
MARISHA: What?!

01:31:18.409 --> 01:31:20.996
TALIESIN: That is the sort of decisions we're
going to start having to make.

01:31:20.996 --> 01:31:25.801
LAURA: What if somebody can Polymorph into a
little green dragon or something?

01:31:25.801 --> 01:31:30.233
MARISHA: Yeah, you went to 11 there on let's start
continuing the genocide.

01:31:30.233 --> 01:31:34.490
LAURA: Fuck shit up as a dragon and leave evidence
behind as a green dragon.

01:31:34.490 --> 01:31:37.791
SAM: I've seen the green dragon. Raishan?

01:31:37.791 --> 01:31:39.301
MATT: You have seen the dragon.

01:31:39.301 --> 01:31:40.355
SAM: How big?

01:31:40.355 --> 01:31:45.699
MATT: Gargantuan. And you cannot Polymorph into
dragons. You can only transform into beasts.

01:31:45.699 --> 01:31:47.188
SAM: I understand.

01:31:47.188 --> 01:31:55.970
MATT: Fairly large, yeah. I'd say probably--
Raishan is the smallest of the dragons you saw,

01:31:55.970 --> 01:32:01.906
but even at the smallest of them, is still a
good 30 feet to the shoulder.

01:32:01.906 --> 01:32:03.781
SAM: I could do that.

01:32:03.781 --> 01:32:06.757
LIAM: Gather all the papier-mâché you have in the
city.

01:32:06.757 --> 01:32:10.853
SAM: I could do something pretty close to that.

01:32:10.853 --> 01:32:13.629
TRAVIS: I bet you could do a lot of incredible
things.

01:32:13.629 --> 01:32:16.571
SAM: Are you Tony Robbins?

01:32:16.571 --> 01:32:21.700
(laughter)

01:32:21.700 --> 01:32:27.509
TALIESIN: I think this is a conversation that can
continue through Marquet. I don't think we're

01:32:27.509 --> 01:32:29.350
going to come up with the best idea tonight.

01:32:29.350 --> 01:32:31.506
MARISHA: But we need to get something started.
Here's what we learned.

01:32:31.506 --> 01:32:32.859
SAM: At dawn.

01:32:32.859 --> 01:32:41.007
MARISHA: At dawn we drink some more. We learned
that Thordak is enslaving sculptors to build his

01:32:41.007 --> 01:32:46.550
image all around Emon. What we have learned is it
seems that each of the dragons have picked a city,

01:32:46.550 --> 01:32:55.369
a domain. Maybe this domain was part of the
bargain to join Thordak's cause. Help me, you get

01:32:55.369 --> 01:32:56.664
your own city.

01:32:56.664 --> 01:32:58.619
TALIESIN: A reasonable and astute observation,
yes.

01:32:58.619 --> 01:33:06.005
MARISHA: So I bet the white dragon would be real
pissed off if statues of Thordak started popping

01:33:06.005 --> 01:33:07.817
up around Draconia.

01:33:07.817 --> 01:33:09.210
LAURA: Or the green dragon.

01:33:09.210 --> 01:33:10.630
MARISHA: Or the green dragon.

01:33:10.630 --> 01:33:13.775
TRAVIS: Or maybe even statues where Umbrasyl's
nest was.

01:33:13.775 --> 01:33:16.302
TALIESIN: Let's pick a dragon.

01:33:16.302 --> 01:33:17.769
LAURA: Vorugal is the white dragon?

01:33:17.769 --> 01:33:27.700
SAM: Raishan is the green. Here's the problem with
goading Vorugal the white to find and kill Raishan

01:33:27.700 --> 01:33:31.663
the green. No one knows where Raishan the green
is, including Vorugal.

01:33:31.663 --> 01:33:33.397
LAURA: How do you know Vorugal doesn't know?

01:33:33.397 --> 01:33:38.663
SAM: Because Raishan's the shapeshifter, and no
one knows where she is, including Gilmore, who's

01:33:38.663 --> 01:33:40.744
been scrying for a week to try to find her.

01:33:40.744 --> 01:33:43.173
LAURA: Yeah, but the white dragon might have some
way to communicate.

01:33:43.173 --> 01:33:45.496
TRAVIS: Do we know how they communicate?

01:33:45.496 --> 01:33:51.346
LIAM: Yes, we do. There were some baubles in a
wall in Krieg's secret cave.

01:33:51.346 --> 01:33:54.727
LAURA: They have other balls, right?

01:33:54.727 --> 01:34:01.234
TRAVIS: Gilmore, Asum, do either of you have a
theory on how they communicate?

01:34:01.234 --> 01:34:10.843
MATT: Gilmore looks to Asum. "I have not been to
any of their bases. Asum, you've been watching Thordak."

01:34:10.843 --> 01:34:20.200
He looks back. "Within his domain in the Cloudtop,
he has... apparently an overhead airplane."

01:34:20.200 --> 01:34:22.268
LAURA: It's very loud.

01:34:22.268 --> 01:34:33.767
MATT: Trust me, it was strange. "He has a number
of various spies that are sworn to him that act as

01:34:33.767 --> 01:34:41.157
"his network of information to and from the
Cloudtop and his throne of black glass and molten

01:34:41.157 --> 01:34:51.907
"rock. He does have singular pillars placed around
that contain four orbs that he would speak into on

01:34:51.907 --> 01:34:53.285
"occasion."

01:34:53.285 --> 01:34:59.771
MARISHA: And didn't we see something similar in
Umbrasyl's and when we killed the blue?

01:34:59.771 --> 01:35:01.850
LAURA: We saw orbs in Umbrasyl's?

01:35:01.850 --> 01:35:05.573
MARISHA: Yeah, remember, it cracked and it was
like, I'm coming for you! And we were like, we

01:35:05.573 --> 01:35:07.188
don't know what that means! And we ignored it.

01:35:07.188 --> 01:35:08.342
LAURA: That was in Brimscythe's.

01:35:08.342 --> 01:35:11.324
LIAM: Did we see that in the black?

01:35:11.324 --> 01:35:13.858
TRAVIS: They were broken already.

01:35:13.858 --> 01:35:15.628
MATT: Yeah. They were already shattered.

01:35:15.628 --> 01:35:19.016
LAURA: He shattered them. Fuck.

01:35:19.016 --> 01:35:20.694
SAM: Why did he shatter them?

01:35:20.694 --> 01:35:24.899
LAURA: So that we wouldn't be able to scry on
anyone else. Or he was pissed!

01:35:24.899 --> 01:35:26.858
SAM: He was pissed at the other dragons, maybe.

01:35:26.858 --> 01:35:36.007
LIAM: But it's not safe to assume-- Asum, sorry--
that they're not in communication. We have to

01:35:36.007 --> 01:35:39.665
assume that they are. I'm so sorry.

01:35:39.665 --> 01:35:43.009
MATT: "It's all right. It's not like my childhood
friend Purvon."

01:35:43.009 --> 01:35:47.367
(laughter)

01:35:47.367 --> 01:35:53.865
TALIESIN: There is a thought. This is a very good
idea. You've got a very good idea.

01:35:53.865 --> 01:35:55.714
SAM: What's the idea?

01:35:55.714 --> 01:36:03.907
MARISHA: I said we start planting statues of
Thordak or Raishan in other dragons' territories.

01:36:03.907 --> 01:36:10.582
Ultimately, though, what we need is we need
someone who knows the dragons' weaknesses. We need

01:36:10.582 --> 01:36:12.514
to know what pushes their buttons.

01:36:12.514 --> 01:36:15.021
SAM: We know what pushes their buttons.

01:36:15.021 --> 01:36:19.714
TALIESIN: We need to know what pushes the reset
button. Why am I speaking in video game metaphor?

01:36:19.714 --> 01:36:21.268
LIAM: What?

01:36:21.268 --> 01:36:22.934
TALIESIN: Nothing. Drink.

01:36:22.934 --> 01:36:29.127
SAM: We can throw up some statues and cause some
havoc, but if they have these orbs that

01:36:29.127 --> 01:36:33.258
communicate with each other, then the white can
call Thordak and say: Hey, what's up with these

01:36:33.258 --> 01:36:35.977
statues? And Thordak can say: No, it's not me.

01:36:35.977 --> 01:36:46.758
TALIESIN: Not statues. Idols. Small images of the
white dragon for worship.

01:36:46.758 --> 01:36:49.143
LIAM: You're gambling on jealousy.

01:36:49.143 --> 01:36:57.052
TALIESIN: Start hiding them in places. If we start
seeding them, especially in Emon, as if he is

01:36:57.052 --> 01:37:01.606
trying to get people to worship him in other
cities as well, silently, quietly underneath--

01:37:01.606 --> 01:37:04.128
SAM: We'll make t-shirts that say Team Vorugal.

01:37:04.128 --> 01:37:09.395
TALIESIN: We just have to make sure that we don't
use the stone from here.

01:37:09.395 --> 01:37:13.830
MARISHA: Well, because we know that Thordak is
definitely vain.

01:37:13.830 --> 01:37:19.089
TALIESIN: And this will piss him off. And if he
says what are you doing, I don't know anything

01:37:19.089 --> 01:37:20.162
about this.

01:37:20.162 --> 01:37:21.948
LAURA: Yeah, he would deny it. Of course he would
deny it.

01:37:21.948 --> 01:37:29.245
MARISHA: And we're assuming-- sorry-- that they'll
ask instead of jumping to conclusions.

01:37:29.245 --> 01:37:31.940
TALIESIN: I like it.

01:37:31.940 --> 01:37:33.972
LAURA: Even if he jumps to conclusions, he would
be pissed.

01:37:33.972 --> 01:37:36.211
SAM: But we know that Thordak is a total asshole--
Sorry.

01:37:36.211 --> 01:37:42.388
(laughter)

01:37:42.388 --> 01:37:46.776
SAM: So we know he'll be pissed off, more or
less.

01:37:46.776 --> 01:37:49.866
MATT: His scarred eye twitches for a moment.

01:37:49.866 --> 01:37:52.782
MARISHA: And we wonder why people hate us.

01:37:52.782 --> 01:38:03.448
MATT: Asum leans into the conversation and goes,
"We have many crafters and artisans that are

01:38:03.448 --> 01:38:08.149
"within the grasp of the Clasp as well, within
Emon. We can begin to have these made and

01:38:08.149 --> 01:38:10.729
"scattered throughout the various offerings brought
to the center of the city."

01:38:10.729 --> 01:38:12.904
TALIESIN: Little shrines, hidden in ruins.

01:38:12.904 --> 01:38:14.418
MATT: "I like this."

01:38:14.418 --> 01:38:17.112
MARISHA: Hashtag Team Vorugal.

01:38:17.112 --> 01:38:22.877
MATT: "We can make this happen." You can make that
happen. Hashtag Team Vorugal.

01:38:22.877 --> 01:38:32.050
TALIESIN: I still will admit that Cabal's Ruin is
one of the Vestiges I feel would be-- and not just

01:38:32.050 --> 01:38:33.428
because I would like to use it.

01:38:33.428 --> 01:38:43.256
MARISHA: Is Ank'harel and the Ozmit Sea in the
same area? Can we hit one on our way to the

01:38:43.256 --> 01:38:44.136
other?

01:38:44.136 --> 01:38:48.805
MATT: The Ozmit Sea is in between Tal'Dorei and--
from your perspective, it's Tal'Dorei and Marquet,

01:38:48.805 --> 01:38:50.689
and the Ozmit Sea is what's in between.

01:38:50.689 --> 01:38:52.235
TALIESIN: So we could do a triple.

01:38:52.235 --> 01:38:56.074
MARISHA: We could do a triple. Because I have to
get to the Water Ashari at some point.

01:38:56.074 --> 01:38:59.811
TALIESIN: And that's very important, because we
need them on our side.

01:38:59.811 --> 01:39:01.801
SAM: Between what and what?

01:39:01.801 --> 01:39:04.200
TALIESIN: Ozmit Sea, so it's over here.

01:39:04.200 --> 01:39:05.684
SAM: It's between what and who?

01:39:05.684 --> 01:39:07.659
MATT: The Ozmit Sea is between Marquet and
Tal'Dorei.

01:39:07.659 --> 01:39:09.084
SAM: Is this Tal'Dorei?

01:39:09.084 --> 01:39:11.414
MARISHA: We're on Tal'Dorei.

01:39:11.414 --> 01:39:16.263
SAM: So Marquet is Japan.

01:39:16.263 --> 01:39:18.642
MATT: More Australia.

01:39:18.642 --> 01:39:25.314
SAM: Got it. Is this world round? Can we go the
other way?

01:39:25.314 --> 01:39:31.306
TALIESIN: Actually, this world is shaped like a
d20, so we're on the flat part at the five.

01:39:31.306 --> 01:39:32.929
SAM: Can't go the other way?

01:39:32.929 --> 01:39:35.969
MATT: You could eventually get there. It is
round.

01:39:35.969 --> 01:39:45.981
LAURA: Would I know how fast dragons can actually
fly? If it's a two-week trip to get to Draconia

01:39:45.981 --> 01:39:47.927
from where we are--

01:39:47.927 --> 01:39:52.830
MATT: Two weeks via ship. Ocean ship.

01:39:52.830 --> 01:39:55.596
LAURA: Okay. If they were flying, how fast could
they get there, potentially?

01:39:55.596 --> 01:39:59.334
TRAVIS: I'm only saying, maybe it's empty, right?

01:39:59.334 --> 01:40:03.247
MARISHA: What is?

01:40:03.247 --> 01:40:05.014
TRAVIS: Draconia.

01:40:05.014 --> 01:40:09.986
MATT: I'm going to make some mathematics here, if
you'll excuse me.

01:40:09.986 --> 01:40:12.587
TRAVIS: I'm only saying, if they were just here--

01:40:12.587 --> 01:40:16.053
SAM: But we could bamf there right now.

01:40:16.053 --> 01:40:19.649
LAURA: Check it out and get out before they get
back.

01:40:19.649 --> 01:40:22.490
TRAVIS: Get people out, do recon, whatever.

01:40:22.490 --> 01:40:24.564
SAM and MARISHA: Plant some seeds.

01:40:24.564 --> 01:40:31.653
LAURA: They've probably left a good amount of army
there to keep people under control. We'd have to

01:40:31.653 --> 01:40:33.609
get in and out in a couple of hours.

01:40:33.609 --> 01:40:35.116
SAM: And what would our mission be?

01:40:35.116 --> 01:40:36.664
LIAM: Dump a couple of statues.

01:40:36.664 --> 01:40:37.967
LAURA: We don't have them.

01:40:37.967 --> 01:40:39.793
TALIESIN: Let other people do that.

01:40:39.793 --> 01:40:46.299
SAM: Wait. What about, instead of dumping statues,
we find these orbs? We find his lair, we find his

01:40:46.299 --> 01:40:54.385
orbs, and we call Thordak and we do a voice like:
Yo, Thordak! You're a dickhead! I'm going to come

01:40:54.385 --> 01:40:58.810
kill you! Or we just smash them.

01:40:58.810 --> 01:41:02.104
TALIESIN: I don't know why everyone's so excited
about the notion of pissing off the dragons to the

01:41:02.104 --> 01:41:05.828
point at which they all come here, but it is a way
to go.

01:41:05.828 --> 01:41:07.060
SAM: They don't know we're here.

01:41:07.060 --> 01:41:08.213
TALIESIN: They know we're here.

01:41:08.213 --> 01:41:10.780
TRAVIS: I'm just pointing out an opportunity where
there is one.

01:41:10.780 --> 01:41:11.929
SAM: That's true.

01:41:11.929 --> 01:41:13.282
MATT: A few days.

01:41:13.282 --> 01:41:15.048
LAURA: It would take them a few days to get
there?

01:41:15.048 --> 01:41:17.995
TRAVIS: A few days? We would have a whole fucking
day!

01:41:17.995 --> 01:41:19.155
MARISHA: What time is it?

01:41:19.155 --> 01:41:22.782
MATT: At this point in time, it's mid-afternoon,
evening.

01:41:22.782 --> 01:41:25.616
SAM: We have to rest.

01:41:25.616 --> 01:41:33.543
LIAM: Percival, even just for intelligence, even
if it was brief, even to see what is going on there.

01:41:33.543 --> 01:41:39.747
TALIESIN: We have to make sure that we can get out
immediately, and we also have to agree that if

01:41:39.747 --> 01:41:43.120
things start looking too iffy, we run.

01:41:43.120 --> 01:41:44.340
MARISHA: I have an idea.

01:41:44.340 --> 01:41:45.896
SAM: You have the best ideas.

01:41:45.896 --> 01:41:46.777
MARISHA: Thank you.

01:41:46.777 --> 01:41:47.900
SAM: Lay it on me.

01:41:47.900 --> 01:41:51.746
MARISHA: Can you Seeming us to all look like
lizard army members?

01:41:51.746 --> 01:41:57.433
SAM: Tomorrow. And we'll look like us, except
vaguely like lizard people.

01:41:57.433 --> 01:41:59.498
TRAVIS: Why not wyverns?

01:41:59.498 --> 01:42:07.338
SAM: First of all, the lizard army, is that
different from wyverns? So they're just scaly

01:42:07.338 --> 01:42:09.380
creepers. I can do that.

01:42:09.380 --> 01:42:11.896
LAURA: Have you seen the lizard people?

01:42:11.896 --> 01:42:13.700
SAM: No, but I'll see them when we get there.

01:42:13.700 --> 01:42:14.800
LAURA: Okay.

01:42:14.800 --> 01:42:19.197
MATT: You've come across a few of the lizardfolk.
They attacked you in Emon. They were on the

01:42:19.197 --> 01:42:25.373
wyverns. They're humanoid. They're a little larger
than one of your half-elf companions or Percy.

01:42:25.373 --> 01:42:29.256
MARISHA: We fought them on the airship, too,
right?

01:42:29.256 --> 01:42:33.137
MATT: No, those were bandits. You fought wyverns.

01:42:33.137 --> 01:42:36.052
SAM: We could be lizard people, for sure.

01:42:36.052 --> 01:42:38.084
LAURA: Wait, what?

01:42:38.084 --> 01:42:45.603
TALIESIN: We could look like lizard people, and it
would trick anybody who wasn't a dragon. And if

01:42:45.603 --> 01:42:48.327
the dragon came, we would be fucked. That would be
the end. That would be game over.

01:42:48.327 --> 01:42:53.702
SAM: (singing) We could be lizard people!

01:42:53.702 --> 01:42:58.170
TALIESIN: I'm going to go on record as saying I do
not think this is the right move.

01:42:58.170 --> 01:43:00.303
LIAM: What do you think is the right move?

01:43:00.303 --> 01:43:04.359
SAM: He wants to go to Marquet to find some cloak
that may or may not help us in a week.

01:43:04.359 --> 01:43:12.915
TALIESIN: Will help us. Getting three more
Vestiges, two more Vestiges, just a little bit

01:43:12.915 --> 01:43:15.981
more power before starting to play chess again.

01:43:15.981 --> 01:43:21.711
LAURA: Really the only point of going there
would be reconnaissance. That's it. No fighting.

01:43:21.711 --> 01:43:24.083
TRAVIS: When else are we going to know for sure?

01:43:24.083 --> 01:43:29.196
TALIESIN: There's an ancient dwarven saying, and
I'm trying to remember where I heard it, but it

01:43:29.196 --> 01:43:35.652
goes somewhere along the lines of, it's never a
three-hour tour. That's my fear.

01:43:35.652 --> 01:43:41.437
TRAVIS: Yeah, I know an ancient dwarven one that
says no risk...

01:43:41.437 --> 01:43:43.124
SAM: That's it.

01:43:43.124 --> 01:43:46.871
TALIESIN: Your mind is a grandfather clock, you
know that.

01:43:46.871 --> 01:43:48.292
TRAVIS: Thank you.

01:43:48.292 --> 01:43:51.176
TALIESIN: It's correct twice a day, easily.

01:43:51.176 --> 01:43:54.889
SAM: If we go, what is our mission?

01:43:54.889 --> 01:43:57.684
TALIESIN: &lt;i&gt;Thank&lt;/i&gt; you.

01:43:57.684 --> 01:44:01.231
MARISHA: To get as many innocents out as we can.

01:44:01.231 --> 01:44:09.118
LAURA: No. That sounds wonderful, but if we get
people out, they're going to know something

01:44:09.118 --> 01:44:10.277
happened.

01:44:10.277 --> 01:44:15.897
MARISHA: I figured if we find good fighters once
again, and do our tree, our teleport thing--

01:44:15.897 --> 01:44:18.498
SAM: We can get 13 people out. That's it.

01:44:18.498 --> 01:44:21.338
MARISHA: But it could be the 13 people that could
change the tide.

01:44:21.338 --> 01:44:23.833
TALIESIN: This is not going to be a fight of 13
people.

01:44:23.833 --> 01:44:30.836
SAM: We had a group of 50 goliaths, and they were
all killed instantly.

01:44:30.836 --> 01:44:33.993
MARISHA: That's what I'm saying.

01:44:33.993 --> 01:44:38.405
LAURA: Plus, if we're lizard people, the survivors
aren't going to be wanting--

01:44:38.405 --> 01:44:41.220
TALIESIN: They're going to be wondering who we
are, first off.

01:44:41.220 --> 01:44:42.576
LAURA: They're going to be afraid of us.

01:44:42.576 --> 01:44:47.348
SAM: I would only want to go there if we had a
distinct plan to disrupt or trick or steal.

01:44:47.348 --> 01:44:50.048
TRAVIS: Disrupting communications is a great
tactic.

01:44:50.048 --> 01:44:52.423
TALIESIN: We're not going to be able to disrupt
communication.

01:44:52.423 --> 01:44:54.833
TRAVIS: You don't think we're going to make it to
the jewels and smashy-smash?

01:44:54.833 --> 01:44:55.791
TALIESIN: No.

01:44:55.791 --> 01:44:57.149
MARISHA: I don't think that's a good idea.

01:44:57.149 --> 01:45:04.625
SAM: And I slice the dragon's throat! And I say, I
am victorious!

01:45:04.625 --> 01:45:07.948
LIAM: That sounds like a plan. Let's go.

01:45:07.948 --> 01:45:13.887
MATT: So what are you guys doing?

01:45:13.887 --> 01:45:18.151
TALIESIN: Tightening up. We're going to go. What
are we going for?

01:45:18.151 --> 01:45:20.997
SAM: Smash the orbs.

01:45:20.997 --> 01:45:27.197
MARISHA: Well, here's something else I want to put
into perspective. If I scry and teleport us to the

01:45:27.197 --> 01:45:35.623
black dragon's lair, I can do one more scry, and
then I would burn my seventh level spell to get us

01:45:35.623 --> 01:45:37.762
there again, and then I'd be tapped out.

01:45:37.762 --> 01:45:39.790
LAURA: So we wouldn't be able to bamf out.

01:45:39.790 --> 01:45:44.400
MARISHA: We wouldn't be able to bamf out that day.
We'd be staying the night.

01:45:44.400 --> 01:45:49.439
SAM: But I can get us a safe place to stay for the
night, no matter where we are.

01:45:49.439 --> 01:45:52.785
TALIESIN: But it means this is not a one-day, this
is a three-day mission.

01:45:52.785 --> 01:45:59.581
MARISHA: I could not teleport us. It depends on
how many times. I've got two teleports, so I can

01:45:59.581 --> 01:46:02.504
teleport us there and teleport us out, but we'd be
doing it from here.

01:46:02.504 --> 01:46:08.761
TALIESIN: We teleport to the black dragon's lair,
we sleep overnight, teleport in, teleport out. And

01:46:08.761 --> 01:46:13.734
then sleep overnight, teleport either to
Whitestone or to Marquet.

01:46:13.734 --> 01:46:17.288
SAM: Can you teleport today? Or are you done?

01:46:17.288 --> 01:46:20.619
MATT: You can only use that once per day, though,
right?

01:46:20.619 --> 01:46:37.897
MARISHA: I used Plane Shift. I didn't use
Transport Via Plants. Yes. Wait. No. I Moved

01:46:37.897 --> 01:46:44.711
Earth. I can't do it today. It has to be tomorrow.
And if that's the case, it's tomorrow, then we

01:46:44.711 --> 01:46:53.470
lose that two-day grace period. Unless we go right
now and sleep overnight in Draconia and start

01:46:53.470 --> 01:46:54.727
first thing in the morning.

01:46:54.727 --> 01:46:59.269
TALIESIN: And risk a very reasonable reason that
they would know where we are.

01:46:59.269 --> 01:47:03.877
MATT: As far as I know, Plane Shift can't teleport
you on the same plane. It brings you specifically

01:47:03.877 --> 01:47:05.503
to another plane of existence.

01:47:05.503 --> 01:47:11.649
MARISHA: Yeah. I'm saying I cast Plane Shift from
the Feywild to here. That's all I'm saying. But I

01:47:11.649 --> 01:47:13.447
used that, and that's a seventh level spell.

01:47:13.447 --> 01:47:17.746
SAM: So if we go to Draconia tonight, if we want
to sleep in the mansion, we can't, because I

01:47:17.746 --> 01:47:19.713
changed his memory.

01:47:19.713 --> 01:47:21.955
LAURA: Oh fuck.

01:47:21.955 --> 01:47:25.840
SAM: So we would have to sleep out in the open as
lizard people.

01:47:25.905 --> 01:47:26.979
LAURA: Nope.

01:47:26.979 --> 01:47:29.123
LIAM: Too many negatives now.

01:47:29.123 --> 01:47:31.008
LAURA: This is danger zone.

01:47:31.008 --> 01:47:34.960
MARISHA: We're getting a lot of cons. There's not
so many pros.

01:47:34.960 --> 01:47:37.642
TALIESIN: We need to sleep anyway, because we're
exhausted.

01:47:37.642 --> 01:47:41.787
TRAVIS: Oh man. I can find all sorts of problems
with a situation if I look hard enough.

01:47:41.787 --> 01:47:48.527
TALIESIN: That is so astute. It's 12:00. My god,
he had a thought.

01:47:48.527 --> 01:47:54.613
TRAVIS: Opportunity. Honestly. There's a dragon's
perch, and he is vacated, and it will probably

01:47:54.613 --> 01:47:56.745
never happen again as far as we know.

01:47:56.745 --> 01:48:00.231
TALIESIN: I disagree. I think the next time they
come to attack and kill us, it will be vacated.

01:48:00.231 --> 01:48:04.066
TRAVIS: Cool. While they're killing Whitestone
because we didn't take advantage of this moment,

01:48:04.066 --> 01:48:05.841
then we'll go to Draconia.

01:48:05.841 --> 01:48:09.034
TALIESIN: I agree. I legitimately agree.

01:48:09.034 --> 01:48:13.386
LAURA: We can sleep and wake up in the morning and
teleport there.

01:48:13.386 --> 01:48:17.615
TALIESIN: We do have to sleep, regardless. There's
no getting around sleep.

01:48:17.615 --> 01:48:21.523
LAURA: We can't fucking go there when we haven't
slept, Grog. We'll all die.

01:48:21.523 --> 01:48:23.654
TALIESIN: We can't actually get there right now.

01:48:23.654 --> 01:48:26.765
MARISHA: There's also no guarantee that they're
going straight back there. Maybe they're heading

01:48:26.765 --> 01:48:31.823
somewhere else. They were heading with an army to
somewhere. It's probably not a city they've

01:48:31.823 --> 01:48:33.195
already conquered.

01:48:33.195 --> 01:48:34.454
TALIESIN: They were heading southeast.

01:48:34.454 --> 01:48:36.161
MATT: Southeast is what you saw, yes.

01:48:36.161 --> 01:48:37.417
SAM: That's where they live.

01:48:37.417 --> 01:48:39.877
TALIESIN: So they're probably heading back home.

01:48:39.877 --> 01:48:42.888
MARISHA: Balls. Then where did they come from?
What were they doing?

01:48:42.888 --> 01:48:44.964
LIAM: They were fishing.

01:48:44.964 --> 01:48:52.212
TALIESIN: They thought that we might be here, and
they took a quick look around, which is why I

01:48:52.212 --> 01:48:54.435
don't want to make any more noise around here.

01:48:54.435 --> 01:48:56.153
SAM: Let's sleep.

01:48:56.153 --> 01:48:57.743
TALIESIN: I'm going to go to the barkeep.

01:48:57.743 --> 01:49:03.905
MATT: There is no barkeep here. This tavern has
been opened just for you guys to be served. There

01:49:03.905 --> 01:49:07.930
is no current owner here. Most everyone who helped
you open this are yourselves and a couple of

01:49:07.930 --> 01:49:09.386
civilians that were just there.

01:49:09.386 --> 01:49:10.855
TALIESIN: Is there a civilian waitress?

01:49:10.855 --> 01:49:14.941
MATT: There is no waitress. There are a couple
civilians outside, but as soon as you guys started

01:49:14.941 --> 01:49:16.443
talking, all the civilians left the room.

01:49:16.443 --> 01:49:17.615
LAURA: They're so nice.

01:49:17.615 --> 01:49:19.672
TALIESIN: There's no barmaid at all?

01:49:19.672 --> 01:49:21.457
LIAM: Your nobility is showing, Percival.

01:49:21.457 --> 01:49:24.688
SAM: I need a young boy.

01:49:24.688 --> 01:49:28.620
(laughter)

01:49:28.620 --> 01:49:33.648
LIAM: These white gloves are sullied. I need a new
set of white gloves, please.

01:49:33.708 --> 01:49:37.999
TALIESIN: They're shooting mittens, and you're
so uncouth.

01:49:37.999 --> 01:49:41.812
SAM: I have an Unseen Servant. Do you need a
servant? I make an Unseen Servant for him.

01:49:41.896 --> 01:49:44.024
MATT: There's a wisp of air.

01:49:44.024 --> 01:49:46.362
SAM: Command him as you see fit.

01:49:46.362 --> 01:49:51.372
TALIESIN: Never mind. This is what I get for
trying to be nice to anybody. I've learned my

01:49:51.372 --> 01:49:52.240
lesson.

01:49:52.240 --> 01:49:53.764
SAM: I tip the Unseen Servant.

01:49:53.764 --> 01:49:57.594
MATT: You toss the coin and it (clinks) to the
ground.

01:49:57.594 --> 01:49:59.372
TRAVIS: I pounce on it.

01:49:59.372 --> 01:50:04.431
MATT: You (soft impact) into this weird cluster of
air. It's pushing your beard hair back, and your

01:50:04.431 --> 01:50:08.711
mouth is full of all that air pushing into it as
you reach into the Unseen Servant, grab the coin,

01:50:08.711 --> 01:50:09.958
and pull it out.

01:50:09.958 --> 01:50:11.201
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:50:11.201 --> 01:50:13.613
MATT: Well done. You got a gold.

01:50:13.613 --> 01:50:17.759
TALIESIN: We'll sleep for now. We'll wake up in
the morning, and we'll either go in one direction

01:50:17.759 --> 01:50:18.976
or the other.

01:50:18.976 --> 01:50:21.029
LAURA: Good plan, guys. Good plan.

01:50:21.029 --> 01:50:23.716
MARISHA: We came up with nothing.

01:50:23.716 --> 01:50:27.960
TALIESIN: That's so not true. We came up with a
lot. We just have to sleep and then make a

01:50:27.960 --> 01:50:30.391
decision based on what the world looks like in the
morning.

01:50:30.391 --> 01:50:33.206
LIAM: Dream about a cloak, Percival. Maybe we can
get you a cloak.

01:50:33.206 --> 01:50:36.562
TALIESIN: That cloak sounds useful.

01:50:36.562 --> 01:50:39.710
MARISHA: All right, let's sleep. Let's go to the
castle.

01:50:39.710 --> 01:50:41.366
MATT: You guys find your way to the castle.

01:50:41.366 --> 01:50:46.713
TALIESIN: As a side, I want to grab Vex for a
quick walk on the way to the castle. I want to go

01:50:46.713 --> 01:50:50.961
by the cemetery. Has it been worked on, by the
way? I suppose I'll find out.

01:50:50.961 --> 01:50:52.440
LIAM: You did say Vex, right?

01:50:52.440 --> 01:50:53.498
TALIESIN: Vax.

01:50:53.498 --> 01:50:54.531
LIAM: You said Vex.

01:50:54.531 --> 01:51:00.661
TALIESIN: &lt;i&gt;Vax.&lt;/i&gt; I've been drinking. I've not even
been drinking, I've been pretend drinking.

01:51:00.709 --> 01:51:04.208
MATT: All right. You grab him.

01:51:04.208 --> 01:51:06.270
TALIESIN: I have something to show you.

01:51:06.270 --> 01:51:07.338
LIAM: What is it?

01:51:07.338 --> 01:51:09.363
TALIESIN: You'll like it. Well, I don't know if
you'll like it. I don't know what you like. I'm

01:51:09.363 --> 01:51:17.180
going to take him to the cemetery, to the crypt.
The title I gave your sister doesn't come with

01:51:17.180 --> 01:51:27.608
much, but it does come with one, at the moment,
tiny plot of land, on which a crypt sits. This was

01:51:27.608 --> 01:51:35.470
the resting place of the father and grandfather
and assorted family members of the man you killed

01:51:35.470 --> 01:51:37.499
the first night we came here.

01:51:37.499 --> 01:51:39.738
LIAM: You want my sister to live in a mausoleum?

01:51:39.738 --> 01:51:49.356
TALIESIN: No. I want something else to live in a
mausoleum. This is actually for you. Open it. I go and I

01:51:49.356 --> 01:51:57.473
light the two little torches on the side. This is
very traditional, and it should open. Do you trust me?

01:51:57.473 --> 01:52:00.887
LIAM: Uh...

01:52:00.887 --> 01:52:03.184
TALIESIN: Good answer. I'll go in first.

01:52:03.184 --> 01:52:05.448
MATT: Percy enters the building.

01:52:05.448 --> 01:52:06.808
LIAM: I follow.

01:52:06.808 --> 01:52:12.598
MATT: Okay. As you enter the mausoleum, the gentle
flickering of torchlight that was lit by Percy

01:52:12.598 --> 01:52:17.931
shows the interior, though it is low-lit
partially, and your darkvision does catch you.

01:52:17.931 --> 01:52:25.641
What was once a relatively decent mausoleum seems
to have been gutted, retrofit, and now you see

01:52:25.641 --> 01:52:31.981
standing before you, is a mostly constructed
shrine to the Raven Queen.

01:52:31.981 --> 01:52:42.752
TALIESIN: I figured it would be a good idea. I've
had my fill of gods, but I'm not so foolish to

01:52:42.752 --> 01:52:47.893
think that we do not need them still. This is here
when you need it.

01:52:47.893 --> 01:52:59.204
LIAM: I am having trouble.

01:52:59.204 --> 01:53:10.088
TALIESIN: Me, too. I do not want to die who I am.
I would like to live long enough to be someone

01:53:10.088 --> 01:53:17.303
else. I think you understand that.

01:53:17.303 --> 01:53:27.672
LIAM: I've been really angry at you.

01:53:27.672 --> 01:53:31.142
TALIESIN: I've been encouraging it.

01:53:31.142 --> 01:53:37.635
LIAM: I don't know if it's entirely fair, but I
can't shake it. I don't know that I'm willing to

01:53:37.635 --> 01:53:39.340
let go of it yet.

01:53:39.340 --> 01:53:50.204
TALIESIN: Good. I certainly do not deserve it yet.
I don't know if I ever will. But I can't think of

01:53:50.204 --> 01:53:58.880
anything else to do with my time on earth right
now, other than... this. I am finished with gods.

01:53:58.880 --> 01:54:02.888
They will not help me. Maybe you will.

01:54:02.888 --> 01:54:04.873
LIAM: Percy.

01:54:04.873 --> 01:54:06.131
TALIESIN: Yes?

01:54:06.131 --> 01:54:12.537
LIAM: I've always liked you. From the beginning,
I've always liked you.

01:54:12.537 --> 01:54:15.430
TALIESIN: I've always liked you, too.

01:54:15.430 --> 01:54:21.926
LIAM: You are intelligent and charming.

01:54:21.926 --> 01:54:23.894
TALIESIN: Thank you.

01:54:23.894 --> 01:54:28.337
LIAM: And good in a tight spot.

01:54:28.337 --> 01:54:38.684
TALIESIN: It's the open spaces where I suffer. The
tight spots, I feel very good about. It's the open

01:54:38.684 --> 01:54:41.833
spaces. This is a very tight spot.

01:54:41.833 --> 01:54:48.707
LIAM: I would like to be friends with you again. I
just have a condition.

01:54:48.707 --> 01:54:50.406
TALIESIN: Yes?

01:54:50.406 --> 01:55:00.268
LIAM: My penchant for forgiveness with my sister's
welfare is razor thin.

01:55:00.268 --> 01:55:01.952
TALIESIN: I know.

01:55:01.952 --> 01:55:06.881
LIAM: If you can respect that, then we don't have
a problem.

01:55:06.881 --> 01:55:13.337
TALIESIN: Do you know why I titled your sister?

01:55:13.337 --> 01:55:16.757
LIAM: I have some idea.

01:55:16.757 --> 01:55:27.047
TALIESIN: She thought she was missing something
that-- and I use this term loosely-- ordinary

01:55:27.047 --> 01:55:37.033
people... We have a magic we use, to convince
people that we deserve the things we get, those of

01:55:37.033 --> 01:55:50.780
us who were born this way. It was treating her
unfairly and limiting her ability to see her world

01:55:50.780 --> 01:56:03.302
for what it was worth, and it was a simple and
easy fix. She is going to wake up one morning--

01:56:03.302 --> 01:56:13.137
not yet, but soon-- and realize that money will
not make her happy, and that trying to please that

01:56:13.137 --> 01:56:22.489
awful father will not make her happy. The first
step in that is realizing that he's weak, and

01:56:22.489 --> 01:56:27.243
there's no better way to do that than being better
titled than your parents.

01:56:27.243 --> 01:56:33.192
LIAM: I don't agree with that line of thinking.

01:56:33.192 --> 01:56:38.753
TALIESIN: I know. But you are not her. And I'm not
saying it's the truth, but it is what I believe is

01:56:38.753 --> 01:56:50.318
in her heart. I think perhaps that might lift. I
will never hurt her. I will never hurt anybody

01:56:50.318 --> 01:56:58.278
intentionally, especially not you, any more than I
already have. In return, I ask: never take your

01:56:58.278 --> 01:57:05.800
eyes off me. Never trust me. And that is the best
friend that you can be.

01:57:05.800 --> 01:57:11.986
LIAM: I will recommit to that same promise I
made.

01:57:11.986 --> 01:57:18.152
TALIESIN: You can like me. I would love that. And
in fact, I hope that I can earn your like.

01:57:18.152 --> 01:57:20.185
LIAM: I do like you.

01:57:20.185 --> 01:57:21.985
TALIESIN: I just never want to earn your trust.

01:57:21.985 --> 01:57:24.263
LIAM: Well, then it's your lucky day.

01:57:24.263 --> 01:57:37.123
TALIESIN: A gentle title will suit your sister
well. I'm leaving.

01:57:37.123 --> 01:57:49.243
MATT: Percy walks out. You're left alone in the
silence and darkness, looking at the small shrine

01:57:49.243 --> 01:57:51.768
before you.

01:57:51.768 --> 01:58:09.724
LIAM: I'm on board. You have me. Whatever you
will. I have something I need to take care of,

01:58:09.724 --> 01:58:22.374
which you know, and I hope you will help me with
it. But I do not take your gift lightly. You have

01:58:22.374 --> 01:58:30.126
me. I close the door again and head back to town.

01:58:30.126 --> 01:58:39.464
MATT: Back into town. You guys quietly keep your
distance in your walk, find your way back to the

01:58:39.464 --> 01:58:44.053
castle to your respective rooms, and an evening's
rest takes you all.

01:58:44.053 --> 01:58:50.131
MARISHA: Do I hear Vax go to his room?

01:58:50.131 --> 01:58:52.376
MATT: Are you waiting to hear Vax go to his room?

01:58:52.376 --> 01:58:53.965
MARISHA: I'm waiting to hear Vax go to his room.

01:58:53.965 --> 01:58:59.808
MATT: Actually, knowing Vax, you wouldn't hear
anything.

01:58:59.808 --> 01:59:06.020
(laughter)

01:59:06.020 --> 01:59:10.854
LIAM: 30.

01:59:10.854 --> 01:59:15.194
MATT: You wait for a long time, and no sound comes
to your ears.

01:59:15.194 --> 01:59:16.827
MARISHA: I go to sleep.

01:59:16.827 --> 01:59:22.511
MATT: All right. And with that, as you guys rest
for the night, we're going to take a quick

01:59:22.511 --> 01:59:28.306
bathroom break. We'll be back here in a few
minutes. We had a friend come and deliver a gift

01:59:28.306 --> 01:59:36.032
to Laura, which you can see presented on the table
now. It is a replica that someone, Kiki Day, made

01:59:36.032 --> 01:59:39.622
this awesome prop replica of Fenthras.

01:59:39.622 --> 01:59:44.325
LAURA: I wish you guys could see it up close.
Obviously, we're going to send a picture on

01:59:44.325 --> 01:59:49.378
Twitter so you guys can see it, but it lights up
different colors!

01:59:49.378 --> 01:59:53.697
MATT: Design based on David Rodriguez's concept
art for Fenthras.

01:59:53.697 --> 01:59:59.100
LAURA: It's got Elvish for "protector" and
"growth."

01:59:59.100 --> 02:00:01.400
MATT: That's so badass.

02:00:01.400 --> 02:00:05.995
LAURA: Did I say it right? Protector, not
protection? Protector is right!

02:00:05.995 --> 02:00:07.903
MARISHA: Protector and growth.

02:00:07.903 --> 02:00:09.707
LAURA: Say what?!

02:00:09.707 --> 02:00:10.851
MATT: That is awesome.

02:00:10.851 --> 02:00:12.041
LAURA: Thank you so much!

02:00:12.041 --> 02:00:13.074
MATT: Thank you, Kiki!

02:00:13.074 --> 02:00:14.590
LAURA: You're unbelievable.

02:00:14.590 --> 02:00:15.991
TRAVIS: Should we put it down?

02:00:15.991 --> 02:00:17.749
MATT: All right. There we go.

02:00:17.749 --> 02:00:19.443
LAURA: Lean it up against the table.

02:00:19.443 --> 02:00:26.823
MATT: So. As you guys come to consciousness the
next morning, the storm has come in now--

02:00:26.823 --> 02:00:31.762
LAURA: By the way, I got terrible sleep. I
replayed everything Saundor said in my head a

02:00:31.762 --> 02:00:33.765
hundred times.

02:00:33.765 --> 02:00:39.217
MATT: Make a general wisdom saving throw.

02:00:39.217 --> 02:00:45.272
LIAM: You're paralyzed from fear.

02:00:45.272 --> 02:00:55.426
LAURA: I am terrible! Wisdom saving throw?
12.

02:00:55.426 --> 02:00:59.285
MATT: 12? Okay. Your evening is hard-pressed. You
do manage to get a full night's sleep; you do not

02:00:59.285 --> 02:01:06.145
suffer any exhaustion. You do manage to get rest, though
the nightmares do come in memory of your last

02:01:06.202 --> 02:01:11.451
encounter at the Feywild, and Saundor's words
still swimming around in your head, finding cracks

02:01:11.451 --> 02:01:20.876
in your sense of self. But you still are stalwart
against the choice you made and the friends that

02:01:20.876 --> 02:01:25.659
were at your back. And as you all come to
consciousness, the sound of rain outside of the

02:01:25.659 --> 02:01:30.960
castle against the exterior stone greets you with
the morning. You can smell the fresh rain in the

02:01:30.960 --> 02:01:38.261
air, and eventually come down to find breakfast
prepared, a meal earned.

02:01:38.261 --> 02:01:39.763
TALIESIN: Not chicken.

02:01:39.763 --> 02:01:47.758
MATT: Not chicken, no. This is eggs, fruits. A
classic Whitestone breakfast. Chicken &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt;

02:01:47.758 --> 02:01:50.655
available, but strangely untouched.

02:01:50.655 --> 02:01:52.453
LAURA: Baked beans. Tell me there's baked beans!

02:01:52.453 --> 02:01:54.773
TALIESIN: The thick, single-slab bacon.

02:01:54.773 --> 02:01:56.116
LIAM: Blood pudding.

02:01:56.116 --> 02:01:58.458
MARISHA: Basically an Irish breakfast.

02:01:58.458 --> 02:02:07.699
MATT: There are a few farms here, most are in the
surrounding fields south of the city. It's good.

02:02:07.699 --> 02:02:08.767
It's fresh.

02:02:08.767 --> 02:02:15.066
TALIESIN: The rain is good. It will mean that
they'll have an easier time figuring out the water

02:02:15.066 --> 02:02:22.170
level while they're digging out beneath the Sun
Tree and making sure that it's secure. I love this

02:02:22.170 --> 02:02:23.695
weather.

02:02:23.695 --> 02:02:33.654
SAM: Well? To Marquet or to Draconia? What's it
going to be? Should we vote?

02:02:33.654 --> 02:02:38.331
TALIESIN: An attempt at an object of power or an
attempt at friends in power?

02:02:38.331 --> 02:02:40.245
SAM: Which is which?

02:02:40.245 --> 02:02:42.450
TALIESIN: Draconia has friends in power.

02:02:42.450 --> 02:02:46.616
MARISHA: Speaking of friends, we should probably
check up on ours.

02:02:46.616 --> 02:02:53.111
TALIESIN: (long sigh) That is true. We haven't
heard anything, but that is true.

02:02:53.111 --> 02:02:57.078
MARISHA: We haven't heard anything about him.

02:02:57.078 --> 02:02:59.719
LAURA: It's terrifying.

02:02:59.719 --> 02:03:01.581
MARISHA: I know.

02:03:01.581 --> 02:03:03.997
SAM: He's probably okay.

02:03:03.997 --> 02:03:06.199
TRAVIS: Who are we talking about?

02:03:06.199 --> 02:03:07.940
(laughter)

02:03:07.940 --> 02:03:09.341
SAM: Jarett.

02:03:09.341 --> 02:03:10.616
TRAVIS: Oh.

02:03:10.616 --> 02:03:15.694
SAM: Our only friend in Draconia.

02:03:15.694 --> 02:03:19.971
TALIESIN: I personally would assume that Tiberius
would either be on his way to one of the two

02:03:19.971 --> 02:03:24.998
cities, if he were so inclined. And if he had
survived. And if he wasn't working in the city

02:03:24.998 --> 02:03:27.276
itself to keep it functioning.

02:03:27.276 --> 02:03:33.049
MARISHA: He's hard-headed enough. So all of those
things are very true.

02:03:33.049 --> 02:03:38.471
TALIESIN: And again, we're at war. This is not a
battle. We do not win by going to Draconia. We do

02:03:38.471 --> 02:03:44.163
not win by going to Marquet. We win months from
now.

02:03:44.163 --> 02:03:48.228
MARISHA: You're starting to make less and less
sense, Percy.

02:03:48.228 --> 02:03:50.180
TALIESIN: No! I'm making perfect sense.

02:03:50.180 --> 02:03:52.265
LIAM: Part of the traditional Whitestone breakfast
is--

02:03:52.265 --> 02:03:54.432
LAURA: A rambling de Rolo.

02:03:54.432 --> 02:03:58.583
TALIESIN: Breakfast needs things to live.

02:03:58.583 --> 02:04:01.259
(laughter)

02:04:01.259 --> 02:04:03.286
LIAM: I think you got that backwards?

02:04:03.286 --> 02:04:09.022
SAM: Whitestone continental breakfast. Two eggs,
rambling tirade.

02:04:09.022 --> 02:04:14.374
(laughter)

02:04:14.374 --> 02:04:17.884
LAURA: Vote, then?

02:04:17.884 --> 02:04:19.180
LIAM: Vote.

02:04:19.180 --> 02:04:21.589
TALIESIN: I'm all right with a vote.

02:04:21.589 --> 02:04:29.982
SAM: All right, all in favor of going to Marquet
to find a Vestige that will maybe give us some

02:04:29.982 --> 02:04:33.110
more power that we need to kill a dragon, say
aye!

02:04:33.110 --> 02:04:35.470
TALIESIN and LIAM: Aye.

02:04:35.470 --> 02:04:40.591
SAM: All in favor of going to Draconia, where we
don't really have a great plan but I think we're

02:04:40.591 --> 02:04:47.134
going to go try to fuck up a dragon's lair and
maybe rescue five people and probably die as

02:04:47.134 --> 02:04:48.989
lizard people, say aye.

02:04:48.989 --> 02:04:51.315
LAURA, TRAVIS, and SAM: Aye.

02:04:51.315 --> 02:04:52.435
MARISHA: Aye.

02:04:52.435 --> 02:04:55.746
LAURA: I've changed my mind. I want to go to
Marquet now.

02:04:55.746 --> 02:04:57.656
SAM: Three to three.

02:04:57.656 --> 02:05:02.560
LAURA: Sorry. Oh shit! I didn't mean to fuck that
up. Trinket, what's your vote?

02:05:02.560 --> 02:05:05.912
TALIESIN: Hold on, let's see if Ashley texts in
the next ten minutes.

02:05:05.912 --> 02:05:10.773
MATT: Three versus three. Are you going leave it
up to the dice, being a game of DND?

02:05:10.773 --> 02:05:12.486
SAM: Let's do it.

02:05:12.486 --> 02:05:14.833
MARISHA: Where's that coin we have?

02:05:14.833 --> 02:05:17.975
TALIESIN: I have it. I have it right here. Yeah.

02:05:17.975 --> 02:05:20.627
LIAM: You could also do one to ten and 11 to 20.

02:05:20.627 --> 02:05:22.167
TALIESIN: One or 20. Ready?

02:05:22.167 --> 02:05:23.877
SAM: Wait, we're just doing one flip?

02:05:23.877 --> 02:05:24.820
LAURA: Yeah!

02:05:24.820 --> 02:05:25.976
SAM: No. What?!

02:05:25.976 --> 02:05:29.385
TALIESIN: Yes. It's flipped!

02:05:29.385 --> 02:05:30.585
LAURA: What is what?

02:05:30.585 --> 02:05:32.879
MARISHA: Okay! 20 is Marquet and a one is
Draconia.

02:05:32.879 --> 02:05:33.958
SAM: What about all the other numbers?

02:05:33.958 --> 02:05:35.968
TALIESIN: There's only two! It's a coin!

02:05:35.968 --> 02:05:38.546
MATT: 20, Marquet. One is Draconia.

02:05:38.546 --> 02:05:40.525
TALIESIN: And any other number, we stay home.

02:05:40.525 --> 02:05:43.760
LAURA: What is it?

02:05:43.760 --> 02:05:48.542
TALIESIN: We're going to Draconia, and we're going
to see if we could find Tiberius.

02:05:48.542 --> 02:05:50.534
SAM: Oh god!

02:05:50.534 --> 02:05:53.875
LAURA: Let it be known, I don't think we should go
as lizard people anymore.

02:05:53.875 --> 02:05:55.182
TRAVIS: Why?

02:05:55.182 --> 02:05:57.863
LAURA: I think we should go as ravaged
Draconians.

02:05:57.863 --> 02:06:00.597
TALIESIN: I think we should go as Draconians.

02:06:00.597 --> 02:06:04.673
MARISHA: We can make ourselves look like
dragonborn with Seeming?

02:06:04.673 --> 02:06:06.616
TALIESIN: I think that's a better plan.

02:06:06.616 --> 02:06:10.290
LAURA: At least that way, they'll trust us.

02:06:10.290 --> 02:06:18.952
TALIESIN: We don't have to teleport to the middle
of nowhere. Well, we do need to get farther away

02:06:18.952 --> 02:06:22.301
from here. Is there any way to get farther away
from where we are right now before we--

02:06:22.301 --> 02:06:25.217
LIAM: Can we get back to Umbrasyl's lair? I
thought that was a good idea.

02:06:25.217 --> 02:06:27.511
SAM: We could go there and there and back.

02:06:27.511 --> 02:06:31.956
TALIESIN: Well, as long as we commit to 24 hours
in Draconia no matter what.

02:06:31.956 --> 02:06:36.566
MARISHA: We can go to Umbrasyl's lair, but it'll
take an extra day, because I can only teleport us

02:06:36.566 --> 02:06:37.996
so many times.

02:06:37.996 --> 02:06:41.226
TALIESIN: I think 72 hours is a perfectly
reasonable amount of time to dedicate to this

02:06:41.226 --> 02:06:42.491
prospect.

02:06:42.491 --> 02:06:50.622
LAURA: Pop in, scry, pop into Draconia, look around
and next day, pop out. Can we do that?

02:06:50.622 --> 02:06:52.109
SAM: Yep.

02:06:52.109 --> 02:06:57.305
LIAM: If we stop at Umbrasyl's lair, is there
anything we can do to run Grog out like a

02:06:57.305 --> 02:07:01.099
labrador? I'm worried about him not getting enough
playtime in.

02:07:01.099 --> 02:07:03.061
SAM: In Draconia?

02:07:03.061 --> 02:07:08.197
LIAM: No, in the mansion. Can you bamf up anything
for him in the mansion?

02:07:08.197 --> 02:07:10.556
SAM: You're talking about tonight?

02:07:10.556 --> 02:07:14.963
LIAM: No. We're going to go camp somewhere for a
day, right?

02:07:14.963 --> 02:07:16.748
LAURA: No, we're going to Draconia.

02:07:16.748 --> 02:07:17.880
LIAM: Right now?

02:07:17.880 --> 02:07:21.855
SAM: Go to the black dragon lair, then go to
Draconia, then spend a night &lt;i&gt;there.&lt;/i&gt;

02:07:21.855 --> 02:07:25.745
LIAM: I've been travelling with these fuckers for
years, and I still don't understand magic.

02:07:25.745 --> 02:07:31.082
MARISHA: Hold on a second. We have two choices if
we're going to Draconia: we can either go to

02:07:31.082 --> 02:07:36.674
Umbrasyl's lair to scry from there, then teleport
there, which means we will be staying the night in

02:07:36.674 --> 02:07:37.735
Draconia.

02:07:37.735 --> 02:07:38.875
SAM: In Draconia?

02:07:38.875 --> 02:07:40.650
TALIESIN and MARISHA: In Draconia.

02:07:40.650 --> 02:07:48.918
MARISHA: Or we go to Draconia right now, blindly,
and then I'd still have a spell to get us out.

02:07:48.918 --> 02:07:50.878
SAM: But they could track us back here.

02:07:50.878 --> 02:07:53.449
LAURA: How can we go there blindly if you don't
know where a tree is?

02:07:53.449 --> 02:07:54.665
MARISHA: Well, I'd scry.

02:07:54.665 --> 02:07:57.163
SAM: And then they'd know where &lt;i&gt;we&lt;/i&gt; are.

02:07:57.163 --> 02:07:59.988
MARISHA: They could theoretically, if we get
caught.

02:07:59.988 --> 02:08:03.245
LAURA: We would only scry on a tree. We wouldn't
scry on a dragon.

02:08:03.245 --> 02:08:05.052
TALIESIN: I have a compromise.

02:08:05.052 --> 02:08:11.288
SAM: Actually, can I just throw this out? The only
thing that would detect us scrying is currently

02:08:11.288 --> 02:08:14.882
flying over the ocean. We can scry right now.

02:08:14.882 --> 02:08:19.444
TALIESIN: Let's scry from the giant's cave outside
the city.

02:08:19.444 --> 02:08:21.843
LAURA: It'll still take a couple of hours to get
there, though?

02:08:21.843 --> 02:08:24.899
TALIESIN: Couple of hours to get there. It's fine.
It's nine. It's seven--

02:08:24.899 --> 02:08:27.286
LAURA: It's 5:00 in the morning!

02:08:27.286 --> 02:08:30.070
TALIESIN: It's 3am! Why are we awake?

02:08:30.070 --> 02:08:33.018
MATT: You're still drunk somehow.

02:08:33.018 --> 02:08:39.047
TALIESIN: We get far enough outside of the city so
at the very least--

02:08:39.047 --> 02:08:41.763
SAM: To the giant's lair! To scry!

02:08:41.763 --> 02:08:48.664
MATT: North of the city, up into the beginning
stages of the Alabaster Sierras, you find the

02:08:48.664 --> 02:08:55.699
abandoned fortress that is there, embedded on the
side of the mountain wall. Keyleth, you are

02:08:55.699 --> 02:08:59.062
attempting a scrying spell? What are you scrying
on?

02:08:59.062 --> 02:09:04.617
MARISHA: Okay. I have the map of Draconia, let me
just see if I can scry--

02:09:04.617 --> 02:09:09.970
SAM: You know what you know in Draconia? Do you
know what you &lt;i&gt;know&lt;/i&gt; in Draconia? You know

02:09:09.970 --> 02:09:15.183
Tiberius and you know his armor, and you know his
objects and personal effects?

02:09:15.183 --> 02:09:17.331
MARISHA: No, we don't know if he's in
Draconia.

02:09:17.386 --> 02:09:19.562
TALIESIN: We may end up somewhere random.

02:09:19.562 --> 02:09:22.846
SAM: That's true. but what do you know what is in
Draconia?

02:09:22.846 --> 02:09:25.806
MARISHA: I know of the things that Tiberius has
told us.

02:09:25.806 --> 02:09:30.969
SAM: Do you know any of his friends or his family?
Have we met his family?

02:09:30.969 --> 02:09:33.546
MATT: You have not met his family. You've never
been there.

02:09:33.546 --> 02:09:38.983
MARISHA: I don't need to have a known location, 
right? I can just scry in a general area, yeah?

02:09:38.983 --> 02:09:41.898
MATT: You need generally a creature of some kind.

02:09:41.898 --> 02:09:43.971
SAM: What about his little pet?

02:09:43.971 --> 02:09:46.673
LAURA: Are you not scrying on a tree?

02:09:46.673 --> 02:09:48.246
LIAM: Lockheed.

02:09:48.246 --> 02:09:53.582
MARISHA: Lockheed has a higher chance of being
dead than Tiberius.

02:09:53.582 --> 02:09:57.545
TALIESIN: I think that's underestimating, or
overestimating-- I don't know.

02:09:57.545 --> 02:09:59.507
LIAM: It's a coin flip.

02:09:59.507 --> 02:10:03.129
TALIESIN: It's a coin flip, really. He's small.

02:10:03.129 --> 02:10:08.584
MARISHA: Well, this could answer our question. If
I can't find anybody, then we might be going to

02:10:08.584 --> 02:10:10.279
Marquet.

02:10:10.279 --> 02:10:11.317
SAM: That's true.

02:10:11.317 --> 02:10:12.908
TALIESIN: Go for it, then. See what happens.

02:10:12.908 --> 02:10:19.420
MARISHA: I guess it's Tiberius, then? He's all I
got. It's got to be someone that I know? It

02:10:19.489 --> 02:10:21.596
can't be something I've heard about?

02:10:21.596 --> 02:10:26.978
MATT: It can be something you've heard about. A
person or a creature.

02:10:26.978 --> 02:10:29.081
TALIESIN: A person or a creature, not a place?

02:10:29.081 --> 02:10:32.003
MATT: Not necessarily, no.

02:10:32.003 --> 02:10:34.230
TALIESIN: Can it be a magic object?

02:10:34.230 --> 02:10:37.473
MATT: It would be a creature of some kind.

02:10:37.473 --> 02:10:40.647
TRAVIS: We know about Tiberius. We know about
Kruvanis Stormwind.

02:10:40.647 --> 02:10:42.704
SAM: We know of Lockheed.

02:10:42.704 --> 02:10:47.575
LIAM: The Mending Wheel. A creature only? Oh shit.
Fucking magic!

02:10:47.575 --> 02:10:49.432
LAURA: That's what he just said!

02:10:49.432 --> 02:10:54.992
MARISHA: Are we gambling on Tiberius being
there?

02:10:54.992 --> 02:10:57.117
SAM: You're going to gamble on Tiberius?

02:10:57.117 --> 02:11:01.212
MARISHA: I am gambling on whoever we scry to,
because they could all be dead.

02:11:01.212 --> 02:11:03.964
SAM: How many times can you scry?

02:11:03.964 --> 02:11:07.430
MARISHA: Theoretically, four times.

02:11:07.430 --> 02:11:10.051
LAURA: I've also got a Scrying Stone.

02:11:10.051 --> 02:11:12.510
TALIESIN: Start with the stone.

02:11:12.510 --> 02:11:15.594
MARISHA: That's right, you've got that goddamn
thing. Give me the stone.

02:11:15.594 --> 02:11:17.918
LAURA: Here.

02:11:17.918 --> 02:11:19.257
MARISHA: Thank you!

02:11:19.257 --> 02:11:22.350
TALIESIN: I think we should call it rock. The
Rock.

02:11:22.350 --> 02:11:23.978
MARISHA: It doesn't go away, right?

02:11:23.978 --> 02:11:25.911
LAURA: No. it's a Scrying Eye. You can use it once
a day.

02:11:25.911 --> 02:11:27.566
MARISHA: Yeah. Let's do this!

02:11:27.566 --> 02:11:29.312
SAM: Start with Tiberius.

02:11:29.312 --> 02:11:30.877
TALIESIN: Start with Tiberius. We'll work our way
down.

02:11:30.877 --> 02:11:32.276
MARISHA: Start with Tiberius.

02:11:32.276 --> 02:11:33.907
LAURA: I was going to bring it out!

02:11:33.907 --> 02:11:35.905
TALIESIN: No, you did wonderfully.

02:11:35.905 --> 02:11:37.796
LAURA: It was just sitting there.

02:11:37.796 --> 02:11:43.693
MATT: You take the object. You close your eyes,
focusing on the memory and the life essence of

02:11:43.693 --> 02:11:55.217
Tiberius Stormwind. You project your thoughts into
the ether. The nature energies carry you into

02:11:55.217 --> 02:11:58.061
the darkness, and there is no response.

02:11:58.061 --> 02:11:59.287
SAM: No response?

02:11:59.287 --> 02:12:01.800
MATT: No response. The scrying spell finds no
target.

02:12:01.800 --> 02:12:04.871
TALIESIN: That can mean a lot of things.

02:12:04.871 --> 02:12:08.943
LIAM: Yes, does that stretch across the planes?

02:12:08.943 --> 02:12:11.379
SAM: Does it?

02:12:11.379 --> 02:12:14.659
MATT: Generally, it's on the same plane of
existence.

02:12:14.659 --> 02:12:17.941
SAM: Okay. What about his father?

02:12:17.941 --> 02:12:19.872
TALIESIN: Or Lockheed?

02:12:19.872 --> 02:12:22.145
SAM: Well, Lockheed would be with--

02:12:22.145 --> 02:12:26.849
TALIESIN: Not necessarily. How many times have we
found stray cats?

02:12:26.849 --> 02:12:30.082
LAURA: It's true. Maybe scry on Lockheed.

02:12:30.082 --> 02:12:33.690
MARISHA: Can I try it? Will it expend
another spell?

02:12:33.690 --> 02:12:35.608
MATT: This one will expend a spell.

02:12:35.667 --> 02:12:38.720
MARISHA: It lasts for ten minutes? Oh, per spell.

02:12:38.720 --> 02:12:41.410
SAM: So you're burning your own spell slot.

02:12:41.410 --> 02:12:43.072
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm burning my own spells.

02:12:43.072 --> 02:12:45.079
LAURA: At least you got one for free.

02:12:45.079 --> 02:12:46.565
SAM: Thanks, Vex.

02:12:46.565 --> 02:12:48.598
MARISHA: It makes me very nervous.

02:12:48.598 --> 02:12:50.133
SAM: We should do his dad.

02:12:50.133 --> 02:12:53.730
TALIESIN: That would be who I would kill if I were
taking over the city.

02:12:53.730 --> 02:12:57.118
SAM: You just want to kill everybody.

02:12:57.118 --> 02:12:58.313
TALIESIN: I do.

02:12:58.313 --> 02:13:02.765
MARISHA: I'm going to try Lockheed. His dad could
be in a place where he's being watched.

02:13:02.765 --> 02:13:09.093
MATT: Okay. So this time, you give the object back
to Vex and you sit down and create the ritual

02:13:09.093 --> 02:13:13.736
space before you. You sit down in the center of
the stone floor of the fortress and you close your

02:13:13.736 --> 02:13:19.994
eyes. This time, you send out your consciousness
once more. The druidic energies carry you an

02:13:19.994 --> 02:13:25.938
extended distance in but a few moments, and your
vision clicks in and you see, perched against a

02:13:25.938 --> 02:13:35.817
snow-covered rock in the inside of a ravine, a
shivering, small, green dragonling. Alone, and is

02:13:35.817 --> 02:13:41.270
partially asleep against the stone. You can see
just past over this large, gaping ravine that is

02:13:41.270 --> 02:13:48.267
the center of this portion of Wildemount, you can
see scattered rubble covered in ice and snow

02:13:48.267 --> 02:13:54.367
and small distant things you can't quite make out
with your vision here occasionally moving through it.

02:13:54.367 --> 02:13:56.258
SAM: Can you see any trees?

02:13:56.258 --> 02:13:58.081
MARISHA: Do I find any trees?

02:13:58.081 --> 02:14:03.293
MATT: Make a perception check.

02:14:03.293 --> 02:14:05.840
MARISHA: 19.

02:14:05.840 --> 02:14:13.530
MATT: 19. There's no visible trees in the ravine.
Anything that would be living down there has

02:14:13.530 --> 02:14:21.719
been-- from your vision here-- obscured by rock,
rubble, ruined floating island, and snowfall. You

02:14:21.719 --> 02:14:26.896
do see growing out of the side of the rock, not
far from where Lockheed is perched is one

02:14:26.896 --> 02:14:36.737
leafless, small branch of a tree that extends out.
And as you glance up, there is a very thick tree

02:14:36.737 --> 02:14:40.173
that is currently jutting out the side of the
mountain.

02:14:40.173 --> 02:14:42.423
MARISHA: Does it appear to be natural?

02:14:42.423 --> 02:14:43.907
MATT: It does.

02:14:43.907 --> 02:14:45.774
MARISHA: And large enough to fit Grog?

02:14:45.774 --> 02:14:47.605
MATT: Maybe.

02:14:47.605 --> 02:14:49.293
LAURA: Jutting out the side of--

02:14:49.293 --> 02:14:53.258
MATT: Yeah. It's not sitting on ground, but is
currently over the ravine.

02:14:53.258 --> 02:15:00.159
MARISHA: Yeah, one of those. Any other trees? Is
this the biggest or closest one?

02:15:00.159 --> 02:15:02.435
MATT: That's all you can make out from this
perspective.

02:15:02.435 --> 02:15:06.011
MARISHA: How big is the ravine? How deep is it?

02:15:06.011 --> 02:15:11.489
MATT: From where you can tell right now, from the
perspective you can see, looking at Lockheed, it's

02:15:11.489 --> 02:15:18.806
probably a good 50-foot fall before you hit a
scattering of broken rock, and eventually it

02:15:18.806 --> 02:15:21.635
comes into a grade to the bottom of the ravine.

02:15:21.635 --> 02:15:23.059
TRAVIS: Not great.

02:15:23.059 --> 02:15:25.130
MARISHA: Not a good option.

02:15:25.130 --> 02:15:28.466
MATT: You guys have fallen 50 feet and been
fine.

02:15:28.466 --> 02:15:34.465
SAM: Someone has Feather Fall, right? No?

02:15:34.465 --> 02:15:41.216
MARISHA: Did it look like a natural cavern or a
man-made cavern that Lockheed was in?

02:15:41.216 --> 02:15:44.680
MATT: From what you can tell, it looks natural.

02:15:44.680 --> 02:15:47.815
MARISHA: Like he found a little cave and is
hiding?

02:15:47.815 --> 02:15:51.490
MATT: It's less of a cave and more he's perched on
this little alcove, this little outcropping of

02:15:51.490 --> 02:15:53.651
rock on the side of the ravine wall.

02:15:53.651 --> 02:15:55.235
MARISHA: Oh, he's on the side of the ravine.

02:15:55.235 --> 02:15:56.684
MATT: On the side of the ravine.

02:15:56.684 --> 02:16:04.349
LAURA: Okay, I have an idea. What if we tie a rope
on something on this side and we all go out of the

02:16:04.349 --> 02:16:07.258
rope really fast and drop down?

02:16:07.258 --> 02:16:08.599
TALIESIN: Grog first.

02:16:08.599 --> 02:16:15.910
SAM: Should you scry one more time, for the dad?
Because best-case scenario, we're in a weird,

02:16:15.910 --> 02:16:19.426
snowy ravine with no civilization around.

02:16:19.426 --> 02:16:24.280
TALIESIN: We don't want to be around any
civilization. And also, that's one more spell gone.

02:16:24.280 --> 02:16:28.827
MATT: You did see, distant, blurred from your
perspective, since the focus of the scry was on

02:16:28.827 --> 02:16:36.470
Lockheed, you did see movement and very small
distant objects within the snow at the base of the ravine.

02:16:36.470 --> 02:16:38.916
LAURA: They could potentially see us as soon as we
come out of the tree.

02:16:38.916 --> 02:16:41.351
SAM: Yeah, we'll be far away.

02:16:41.351 --> 02:16:44.587
MARISHA: They could be citizens, they could be
creatures? I just saw movement of figures, I

02:16:44.587 --> 02:16:45.964
didn't see any details?

02:16:45.964 --> 02:16:48.467
SAM: Seems like a good plan.

02:16:48.467 --> 02:16:49.632
LAURA: This is risky.

02:16:49.632 --> 02:16:51.060
MARISHA: This is ridiculous.

02:16:51.060 --> 02:16:56.696
TALIESIN: It's true. There's only risk at this
point. Is this the risk we make or is this not the

02:16:56.696 --> 02:16:58.609
risk we make. Grog?

02:16:58.609 --> 02:17:02.448
TRAVIS: Oh, are we asking for Grog's opinion now?

02:17:02.448 --> 02:17:04.221
TALIESIN: Only so that we can ignore it.

02:17:04.221 --> 02:17:09.003
LAURA: You're the one that was most adamant about us
going there.

02:17:09.068 --> 02:17:11.748
TALIESIN: With the new data, how do you feel?

02:17:11.748 --> 02:17:15.100
TRAVIS: I think we should take the hint and not
go.

02:17:15.100 --> 02:17:17.477
SAM: But you said--

02:17:17.477 --> 02:17:22.219
TRAVIS: Yeah, but I was picturing meandering
out of a nice, beautiful tree in a forest.

02:17:22.219 --> 02:17:25.002
SAM: It's a little jolt. It's a little fall. It's
fine.

02:17:25.002 --> 02:17:29.998
LIAM: That's it. He created this idea and he's
backing out.

02:17:29.998 --> 02:17:37.126
SAM: You told us your famous phrase: all risk!
That's what this is.

02:17:37.126 --> 02:17:43.964
TRAVIS: I do hate to have my own words used
against me.

02:17:43.964 --> 02:17:49.854
SAM: All risk. That's what this is! We are
doing all risk!

02:17:49.854 --> 02:17:57.471
TRAVIS: I'm down to party. I'm just saying it was
a little different in my head.

02:17:57.471 --> 02:18:00.403
SAM: I've never known you to be a coward, Grog.

02:18:00.403 --> 02:18:06.385
TALIESIN: No! Why would you do that?!

02:18:06.385 --> 02:18:07.635
LAURA: Why, Scanlan?!

02:18:07.635 --> 02:18:11.375
TRAVIS: I'll go first. You hold my hand, and I'll
go first.

02:18:11.375 --> 02:18:14.640
LIAM: He can play the fiddle very well.

02:18:14.640 --> 02:18:16.766
TRAVIS: I'll go. Let's do it. I'm ready.

02:18:16.766 --> 02:18:22.453
LAURA: Okay, before we go through, I'm going to
cast Pass Without a Trace on us so we can stealth

02:18:22.453 --> 02:18:24.738
through the tree. Like that's going to work.

02:18:24.738 --> 02:18:26.401
TALIESIN: No, that's a good idea.

02:18:26.401 --> 02:18:30.286
LAURA: I'm going to look for something very solid.
Are there trees around us that we can go through

02:18:30.286 --> 02:18:31.322
right now?

02:18:31.322 --> 02:18:33.698
MATT: A short walk, you could get down to the base
of the forest.

02:18:33.698 --> 02:18:38.669
LAURA: All right. I'm going to tie the rope off
onto a very sturdy thing next to a tree that

02:18:38.669 --> 02:18:40.345
we're going to go through.

02:18:40.345 --> 02:18:41.628
TALIESIN: We're going to rappel.

02:18:41.628 --> 02:18:42.723
LAURA: Yes.

02:18:42.723 --> 02:18:45.769
TRAVIS: Does the portal only close after a
couple seconds?

02:18:45.826 --> 02:18:49.532
TALIESIN: Yes. Six seconds. We're all going to
hold on to the rope and we all go.

02:18:49.532 --> 02:18:51.866
MATT: Six seconds for all of you to--

02:18:51.866 --> 02:18:53.668
LAURA: Jump out!

02:18:53.668 --> 02:18:55.898
MARISHA: Bungee-jumping out of a tree!

02:18:55.898 --> 02:18:57.423
LIAM: We are fucking idiots!

02:18:57.423 --> 02:18:58.620
MARISHA: This is the stupidest--

02:18:58.620 --> 02:19:04.273
TALIESIN: This is a terrible plan. I want to go on
record for saying I was against this plan--

02:19:04.273 --> 02:19:10.155
SAM: We can just leave really quick! She's got
another teleport, yeah. We're going to climb up to

02:19:10.155 --> 02:19:11.367
the tree--

02:19:11.367 --> 02:19:19.029
MARISHA: I didn't see Draconia. I saw the ravine,
and it was snowy, so we can assume it's nearby.

02:19:19.029 --> 02:19:21.975
But I didn't see Draconia, did I?

02:19:21.975 --> 02:19:24.248
MATT: You've never seen Draconia before.

02:19:24.248 --> 02:19:26.024
MARISHA: But did I see a city in my scry?

02:19:26.024 --> 02:19:27.330
MATT: You saw no city.

02:19:27.330 --> 02:19:28.600
LAURA: You saw rubble.

02:19:28.600 --> 02:19:31.997
MARISHA: Once again, Lockheed could have flown
miles away.

02:19:31.997 --> 02:19:33.213
TALIESIN: He could have.

02:19:33.213 --> 02:19:39.331
SAM: At the worst, this is a quick recon mission.
We jump back in the tree, we come back. 15

02:19:39.391 --> 02:19:40.393
minutes.

02:19:40.393 --> 02:19:43.171
LAURA: But there's things that were crawling
around amongst the dead.

02:19:43.171 --> 02:19:45.214
SAM: They were far off in the distance!

02:19:45.275 --> 02:19:50.359
TALIESIN: They weren't that far off. But to be fair,
this is what a plan is, is everything going wrong.

02:19:50.359 --> 02:19:53.785
So I'm all right with doing this, if we're doing
this.

02:19:53.785 --> 02:19:55.124
TRAVIS: All right, sweet. I am, too.

02:19:55.124 --> 02:19:58.067
MARISHA: All right, fuck it! Let's do it.

02:19:58.067 --> 02:20:05.506
MATT: All right. So you've affixed the rope at the
base of the strongest tree you can find.

02:20:05.506 --> 02:20:09.925
MARISHA: Are we going to tie ourselves to each
other again, like before?

02:20:09.925 --> 02:20:13.820
LAURA: No! Because that's dumb. We're going to
break our backs. I'm going to cast Pass Without a

02:20:13.820 --> 02:20:16.903
Trace on everyone right now because why the fuck
not?

02:20:16.903 --> 02:20:19.760
SAM: You got a fucking broom. I'm hopping on the
broom.

02:20:19.760 --> 02:20:21.883
LAURA: Oh yeah, I'm on the broom. And he's on the
broom.

02:20:21.947 --> 02:20:24.462
TALIESIN: Vex, we're going to have the greatest
I-told-you-so if we survive this.

02:20:24.462 --> 02:20:27.968
MATT: All right. We have Vex and Scanlan on the
broom.

02:20:28.035 --> 02:20:30.821
TRAVIS: Should you make me some something teensy?

02:20:30.821 --> 02:20:32.973
MARISHA: Oh, this is such a stupid idea...

02:20:32.973 --> 02:20:36.216
TALIESIN: No, we're going to need every spell we
need in there. No, you're the weight that's going

02:20:36.216 --> 02:20:37.988
to hold the rope down, you're going first.

02:20:37.988 --> 02:20:39.517
MATT: Any of your spell prep?

02:20:39.517 --> 02:20:43.885
LIAM: I'm going to pop my wings out and hook my
arms under Kiki's armpits.

02:20:43.953 --> 02:20:45.338
MATT: Okay.

02:20:45.338 --> 02:20:48.150
TALIESIN: I'm holding on the rope, because I'm an
idiot.

02:20:48.150 --> 02:20:51.805
MATT: All right. Grog and Percy holding onto the
rope.

02:20:51.805 --> 02:20:55.513
MARISHA: This is stupid. This is so stupid!

02:20:55.513 --> 02:20:56.709
TALIESIN: I hate you all.

02:20:56.709 --> 02:20:59.770
MARISHA: We've done so many fucking stupid things.
But this is really stupid.

02:20:59.770 --> 02:21:06.011
MATT: Vex casts Pass Without a Trace. The shadows
reach around and embrace your forms. You become more

02:21:06.011 --> 02:21:10.133
obscured the further the light is from your body.
Keyleth, what are you doing?

02:21:10.201 --> 02:21:15.767
MARISHA: I cast Transport Via Plants on that big,
fatty tree!

02:21:15.767 --> 02:21:20.406
MATT: Keyleth touches the edge of the tree, the
rope which is affixed to above. The trunk (portal opens).

02:21:20.406 --> 02:21:21.704
MARISHA: Everyone ready?

02:21:21.704 --> 02:21:23.132
TALIESIN and MARISHA: Go!

02:21:23.132 --> 02:21:24.858
LAURA: I fly through stealthily.

02:21:24.858 --> 02:21:26.415
MATT: You fly through stealthily.

02:21:26.415 --> 02:21:30.439
LAURA: I'm trying to get down to the ground
quickly and hide behind something.

02:21:30.439 --> 02:21:33.515
MATT: Right. I would like all of you guys to make
stealth checks at disadvantage.

02:21:33.515 --> 02:21:37.379
TRAVIS: Yes! That's awesome.

02:21:37.379 --> 02:21:39.177
MARISHA: Oh, that's not too bad.

02:21:39.177 --> 02:21:41.868
TRAVIS: 17!

02:21:41.868 --> 02:21:44.952
SAM: Pass Without a Trace?

02:21:44.952 --> 02:21:48.776
TRAVIS: Oh. 27.

02:21:48.776 --> 02:21:50.048
TALIESIN: 20.

02:21:50.048 --> 02:21:50.873
SAM: 20.

02:21:50.873 --> 02:21:51.675
MARISHA: 22.

02:21:51.675 --> 02:21:52.537
LIAM: 35.

02:21:52.537 --> 02:21:53.417
LAURA: 33.

02:21:53.417 --> 02:21:54.510
TRAVIS: 27.

02:21:54.510 --> 02:22:03.221
MATT: All right. As Vex and Scanlan scoot first
through the opening, you coast down, and there is

02:22:03.221 --> 02:22:07.852
a cluster of rocks, but there's a light snowdust,
and you find a snowbank that you guys coast down

02:22:07.852 --> 02:22:11.381
to quickly. You can decide to float above the
snowbank. What do you want to do?

02:22:11.381 --> 02:22:14.290
LAURA: We get down on the ground and go under.

02:22:14.290 --> 02:22:20.510
MATT: Okay, so you disappear under the snowbank. It is
freezing cold, the wet immediately falling snow

02:22:20.510 --> 02:22:26.277
against your form begins to seep in. But you are
below eye-level. Vax and Keyleth? You guys just

02:22:26.277 --> 02:22:28.100
dart through, you holding her.

02:22:28.100 --> 02:22:32.880
LIAM: Fly through, and then once I see them hit
the ground, I'm going to dive-bomb us, and I'm

02:22:32.880 --> 02:22:37.252
going to wrap us in a little wing bubble and roll
into the snow.

02:22:37.252 --> 02:22:44.412
MATT: All right. As you guys come falling out the
side of the tree, you see nearby as a small,

02:22:44.412 --> 02:22:53.870
green tiny dragon gets startled and flies off. You
guys go coasting, the wings expand for a second.

02:22:53.870 --> 02:23:01.766
It picks up and as you hit, whipping past the 15 feet
of jagged rocks that were gathered at the

02:23:01.766 --> 02:23:07.107
base of the ravine, you scoot over it, the wings
fold in around you, and you guys tumble into the

02:23:07.107 --> 02:23:11.259
snow. Make an acrobatics check with disadvantage
because you're grabbing onto her and are

02:23:11.259 --> 02:23:12.775
covered in wings.

02:23:12.775 --> 02:23:14.228
LAURA: And you're covered in wings.

02:23:14.228 --> 02:23:17.414
LIAM: I rolled a 15 and a 20. That would be a 30.

02:23:17.414 --> 02:23:25.683
MATT: You don't feel the pain. And the wings do
cause a significant barrier of impact, as well as

02:23:25.683 --> 02:23:30.882
the snow. As soon as you land, you go into a
classic shoulder roll and use the inertia to not

02:23:30.882 --> 02:23:35.381
arise above the water. You both essentially coast
sideways, stopping within the snowbank. From an

02:23:35.381 --> 02:23:40.615
overhead perspective, you can see a large swath
has been carved through. But from visual eye

02:23:40.615 --> 02:23:43.786
range, at equal level, you guys still appear to be
hidden within the snow.

02:23:43.853 --> 02:23:50.972
The two of you jump through and start rappelling
down, Grog at the bottom end. Bringing the rope,

02:23:50.972 --> 02:23:58.445
bringing the rope down, bringing the rope down. It
slams shuts, the rope cuts at the other end as the

02:23:58.445 --> 02:24:04.501
portal closes. Percy, you just make it out as
the rope gives way. It is now Grog and Percy

02:24:04.501 --> 02:24:06.334
plummeting toward the ground.

02:24:06.334 --> 02:24:08.958
MARISHA: I cast a Grasping Vine to grab Grog.

02:24:08.958 --> 02:24:12.594
MATT: You don't have the opportunity, because this
all happens in a period of six seconds and you

02:24:12.594 --> 02:24:14.683
guys just landed and coasted in the snow.

02:24:14.683 --> 02:24:16.147
TRAVIS: Am I right under Percy?

02:24:16.147 --> 02:24:18.452
MATT: He's about five feet ahead of you, yeah.

02:24:18.452 --> 02:24:20.032
TRAVIS: (laughs)

02:24:20.032 --> 02:24:23.821
TALIESIN: I'm going to let that happen.

02:24:23.821 --> 02:24:27.457
MATT: You're cushioning his fall?

02:24:27.457 --> 02:24:28.486
TRAVIS: Yep.

02:24:28.486 --> 02:24:33.882
MATT: All right. Make an acrobatics check, just
for the hell of it.

02:24:33.882 --> 02:24:37.528
LIAM: I love this game.

02:24:37.528 --> 02:24:38.793
TRAVIS: 13.

02:24:38.793 --> 02:24:44.238
MATT: 13. As soon as you look over your shoulder
and see the ground coming, you try and swing your

02:24:44.238 --> 02:24:48.934
legs underneath to catch you, to slide across. And
you begin to. Your feet catch the rock and you

02:24:48.934 --> 02:24:55.129
feel the muscles tense. Your back gets jammed a
little bit. And you catch Percy in your arms, but

02:24:55.129 --> 02:25:02.265
the momentum of Percy hitting you sends you back
over, and you both tumble into the snow. You do

02:25:02.265 --> 02:25:07.784
prevent Percy from taking any damage, but you do
suffer five points of fall damage.

02:25:07.784 --> 02:25:10.050
LIAM: Stubbed your toe, big guy?

02:25:10.050 --> 02:25:12.354
TRAVIS: I got a booby.

02:25:12.354 --> 02:25:16.484
SAM: Is Lockheed within range still? Can we see
him?

02:25:16.484 --> 02:25:18.586
MATT: You guys make a perception check.

02:25:18.586 --> 02:25:21.429
MARISHA: Can I look, too?

02:25:21.429 --> 02:25:24.116
MATT: You're just now getting
up out of the ball of wings.

02:25:24.116 --> 02:25:25.256
LAURA: 25.

02:25:25.256 --> 02:25:26.273
SAM: Six.

02:25:26.273 --> 02:25:27.221
LAURA: 25.

02:25:27.221 --> 02:25:32.373
MATT: 25. You do see Lockheed is about 50, 60 feet
up on the rock right now.

02:25:32.373 --> 02:25:34.669
SAM: Where's Lockheed?

02:25:34.669 --> 02:25:45.862
LAURA: Can I whisper in Draconic? Lockheed! And
whatever the word is for "Come to me."

02:25:45.862 --> 02:25:49.512
MATT: Seems too far to really be within earshot of
a whisper.

02:25:49.512 --> 02:25:59.014
SAM: I see her doing this. I point to him, and I
cast Message, and I say: Lockheed! We're down

02:25:59.014 --> 02:26:01.646
here! Come down! It's us, your friends!

02:26:01.646 --> 02:26:18.191
MATT: Lockheed (wingbeats) and then glides against
the rock. And glides lower to the rock. Glides

02:26:18.191 --> 02:26:27.359
lower to the rock, and flies up-- still keeping a
cautious distance from you above the snow.

02:26:27.359 --> 02:26:34.097
LIAM: Tibs. We're friends with Tibs. Tiberius. You
remember us?

02:26:34.097 --> 02:26:40.821
MATT: You can see Lockheed a little closer
now. You remember him being fairly sick when he was

02:26:40.821 --> 02:26:45.721
initially purchased. While the illness has passed,
he looks greatly malnourished and thin--

02:26:45.721 --> 02:26:49.569
LAURA: I pull out some of my food that I give to
Trinket and try to feed it...

02:26:49.569 --> 02:26:52.877
MATT: As soon as you pull out the food, Lockheed's
demeanor changes immediately. Darts up and almost

02:26:52.877 --> 02:26:54.985
latches onto your hand and causes you to jump--

02:26:54.985 --> 02:26:58.226
LAURA: I cast Speak With Animals. Is he an
animal?

02:26:58.226 --> 02:26:59.343
MATT: Nope.

02:26:59.343 --> 02:27:01.177
SAM: I have Speak With Small Beasts...

02:27:01.177 --> 02:27:02.582
MATT: Not a beast.

02:27:02.582 --> 02:27:03.782
SAM: Fuck you!

02:27:03.782 --> 02:27:06.375
(laughter)

02:27:06.375 --> 02:27:08.253
LIAM: He's a little small monster.

02:27:08.253 --> 02:27:13.856
LAURA: I would have known, as a dragon expert,
that he's not a fucking animal, then. Whatever.

02:27:13.856 --> 02:27:16.855
SAM: What is a monster?

02:27:16.855 --> 02:27:18.786
TALIESIN: Hit your head in the fall.

02:27:18.786 --> 02:27:20.869
LAURA: I didn't fall, I flew.

02:27:20.869 --> 02:27:23.397
TRAVIS: Pike's a small monster.

02:27:23.397 --> 02:27:28.350
SAM: Just grab him and put him in the bag of
holding!

02:27:28.350 --> 02:27:37.679
MATT: At this point now, the temperature's really
set into you. You've heard stories. You're

02:27:37.679 --> 02:27:52.200
familiar with the sound. The words you've heard of
Wildemount, being largely a colder continent,

02:27:52.200 --> 02:27:59.239
especially to the north where the actual
civilizations of man exist. Draconia's a little

02:27:59.239 --> 02:28:04.929
further to the south, but also based on the
information you have, this being taken recently as

02:28:04.929 --> 02:28:14.199
the den of Vorugal, there is an almost perpetual
small snowstorm that is existing about this

02:28:14.199 --> 02:28:21.770
ravine, and the wind itself is beginning to cut
through. Thankfully, you're mostly armored up. For

02:28:21.770 --> 02:28:27.170
the time being, you're fine. But you can see where
this is a difficult weather pattern to perpetually

02:28:27.170 --> 02:28:32.353
live in. Lockheed finishes eating vigorously and
seems to be waiting across your hand.

02:28:32.353 --> 02:28:36.298
LAURA: Perch him on my shoulder and get out some
more of the little boar meat we have in the bag of

02:28:36.298 --> 02:28:38.579
colding and feeding him.

02:28:38.579 --> 02:28:40.585
MATT: He eats some, happily.

02:28:40.585 --> 02:28:46.300
LAURA: Can I speak Draconic to him, see if he
understands any of that?

02:28:46.300 --> 02:28:47.811
MATT: What do you say?

02:28:47.811 --> 02:28:49.815
LIAM: Tiberius was teaching him Draconic.

02:28:49.815 --> 02:28:57.153
LAURA: Yeah, I know. I say "Where is Tiberius?" in
Draconic.

02:28:57.153 --> 02:29:00.120
LIAM: Where is home?

02:29:00.120 --> 02:29:01.773
LAURA: Where is home?

02:29:01.773 --> 02:29:04.473
MATT: (croaking)

02:29:04.473 --> 02:29:07.673
LIAM: Unless Tibs got further along with him, it
was one word--

02:29:07.673 --> 02:29:11.396
SAM: He was teaching him "sit" and "play dead" and
stuff.

02:29:11.396 --> 02:29:12.978
LIAM: One word at a time.

02:29:12.978 --> 02:29:14.853
LAURA: All right. Stay.

02:29:14.853 --> 02:29:22.590
MATT: And stays and digs in the talons at the top
of your leather armor shoulder, folds thed wings in

02:29:22.590 --> 02:29:26.564
and just waits there, huddled up against 
your shoulder for warmth.

02:29:26.564 --> 02:29:29.513
TALIESIN: I'm going to look around and see if
there's a direction in which it seems there's

02:29:29.513 --> 02:29:32.169
civilization or any signs of battle or otherwise.

02:29:32.238 --> 02:29:35.060
MATT: Make a perception check.

02:29:35.060 --> 02:29:37.386
TALIESIN: 16.

02:29:37.386 --> 02:29:43.733
MATT: 16. You bring your head above the snowline
and you can see surrounding you-- and you are in

02:29:43.733 --> 02:29:49.364
the center of this giant ravine that opens up to
the sky. Not quite Grand Canyon size, but it's

02:29:49.364 --> 02:29:56.202
about half the width. It's a wide gulf. And you
guys are on one side of where the ravine slowly

02:29:56.202 --> 02:30:00.967
begins to coalesce, and there's various steps in
which the ravine casts down. You were already

02:30:00.967 --> 02:30:03.805
towards the bottom when you landed. This could
have been a lot worse were it higher up.

02:30:03.805 --> 02:30:15.121
Looking up, you see, just from this vantage point,
dozens of large stacks of broken rock and stone.

02:30:15.121 --> 02:30:21.634
You see pillars that are jutting out of portions
of this. You see partially and mostly collapsed

02:30:21.634 --> 02:30:28.811
buildings that themselves have been destroyed from
serious impact. You recall, during the initial

02:30:28.811 --> 02:30:34.197
attack of the Conclave, that one of the things
that was seen through a vision was the fall of

02:30:34.197 --> 02:30:40.820
Draconia, which were islands of stone that were
held aloft through arcane means within this

02:30:40.820 --> 02:30:46.783
ravine. What you now look upon are all the fallen
remains of each of these arcane islands now

02:30:46.783 --> 02:30:54.526
plummeted, crushed, and fell into the ravine and
have been sundered and destroyed. You do see

02:30:54.526 --> 02:30:59.753
figures moving quickly and crawling over elements
of it, and you see a cluster of them fighting over

02:30:59.753 --> 02:31:01.368
something and then disperse.

02:31:01.368 --> 02:31:02.637
LIAM: How far off?

02:31:02.637 --> 02:31:04.292
MATT: They're probably a good 300 feet off.

02:31:04.292 --> 02:31:06.520
LAURA: Could we tell what kind of creatures they
are?

02:31:06.520 --> 02:31:11.987
MATT: They appear to be humanoid, somewhat
reptilian.

02:31:11.987 --> 02:31:14.958
SAM: Should I make us lizard people?

02:31:14.958 --> 02:31:22.751
MARISHA: Can I do a nature check to see if I can
see the origin, the epicenter of the storm? Like

02:31:22.751 --> 02:31:25.365
the eye of the storm? Where it's coming from?

02:31:25.365 --> 02:31:26.895
TALIESIN: Clever.

02:31:26.895 --> 02:31:33.170
MARISHA: 16.

02:31:33.170 --> 02:31:42.756
MATT: 16. Best that you can view, the storm seems
to be slowly spiraling, and a large heavy portion

02:31:42.756 --> 02:31:51.874
of the snowfall and sleet is hitting about a mile
or so towards the right side of the ravine that

02:31:51.874 --> 02:31:55.157
you guys are looking at. From the wall you're at,
you have the right and the left sides of this

02:31:55.157 --> 02:31:59.383
current ravine structure, seems to be that
direction, about a mile.

02:31:59.383 --> 02:32:01.647
MARISHA: I think the dragon's lair is that way.

02:32:01.647 --> 02:32:05.679
SAM: Can you look around for more trees that
aren't so hard to get to in case we need to make a

02:32:05.679 --> 02:32:06.930
fast getaway?

02:32:06.930 --> 02:32:08.233
TALIESIN: We could just keep our eyes open.

02:32:08.233 --> 02:32:09.607
SAM: All right.

02:32:09.607 --> 02:32:14.735
MARISHA: You said it was a mile. Can we traverse
through the bottom of the ravine to get there in

02:32:14.735 --> 02:32:15.860
that direction?

02:32:15.860 --> 02:32:17.117
SAM: Or is it all water?

02:32:17.117 --> 02:32:18.340
MATT: No, you can.

02:32:18.340 --> 02:32:24.847
TRAVIS: We're going to crack out the good old Dust
of Tracelessness since there's knee-high snow?

02:32:24.847 --> 02:32:32.200
TALIESIN: Let's not be fleshy.

02:32:32.200 --> 02:32:37.173
SAM: You want me to make us Draconians or lizard
people?

02:32:37.173 --> 02:32:40.562
TALIESIN: If we're lizard people, Draconians will
not trust us.

02:32:40.562 --> 02:32:43.844
LIAM: Yeah. We can at least pretend to cower and
be afraid of lizard men if we see them.

02:32:43.844 --> 02:32:45.750
SAM: I don't think Grog can cower.

02:32:45.750 --> 02:32:48.434
TRAVIS: What is the definition of this word?

02:32:48.434 --> 02:32:50.591
SAM: Be a wussy.

02:32:50.591 --> 02:32:52.520
TALIESIN: Shaky dance.

02:32:52.520 --> 02:32:55.074
(laughter)

02:32:55.074 --> 02:33:05.323
LIAM: You know when you bang your balls on a rock
or something? It's like that, you go, (groans).

02:33:05.323 --> 02:33:19.483
TALIESIN: Is there anything you're not good at?
Don't think that hard. Never mind.

02:33:19.483 --> 02:33:25.353
SAM: Draconians?

02:33:25.353 --> 02:33:26.896
TALIESIN: Draconians.

02:33:26.896 --> 02:33:32.624
SAM: I will cast Seeming on the party and make us
all Draconians.

02:33:32.624 --> 02:33:38.455
MATT: What kind of Draconians? There are many
types of colors, there are those with and without tails--

02:33:38.455 --> 02:33:39.927
SAM: Wasn't Tiberius a strange one?

02:33:39.927 --> 02:33:41.215
LAURA: Don't do red!

02:33:41.215 --> 02:33:42.482
SAM: He was a strange one, right?

02:33:42.482 --> 02:33:45.074
MARISHA: He was the odd man out.

02:33:45.074 --> 02:33:47.219
LIAM: They didn't take kindly to him.

02:33:47.219 --> 02:33:49.851
SAM: Metallic, yeah?

02:33:49.851 --> 02:33:51.246
LIAM: Bronze?

02:33:51.246 --> 02:33:54.211
SAM: Like gray, silver?

02:33:54.211 --> 02:33:58.798
LAURA: Maybe it's good to make us silvers and
whiteish!

02:33:58.798 --> 02:34:07.606
SAM: Bronze, silver, and gold then, I guess.

02:34:07.606 --> 02:34:10.225
LIAM: That's chromatic. Metallic! Bronze, silver,
gold.

02:34:10.225 --> 02:34:11.906
SAM: Yeah, we'll do the Olympics.

02:34:11.906 --> 02:34:15.752
MATT: With or without tail? Because you've met
both.

02:34:15.752 --> 02:34:19.569
TALIESIN: They won't actually be tails. That might
actually get us in trouble.

02:34:19.569 --> 02:34:21.283
SAM: Which one was Tiberius?

02:34:21.283 --> 02:34:22.792
MATT: Tiberius had a tail.

02:34:22.792 --> 02:34:24.420
SAM: Do most of them have a tail?

02:34:24.420 --> 02:34:27.611
LAURA: Gern didn't have a tail and he was less
than-- I don't think Draconians will like us

02:34:27.611 --> 02:34:28.986
without a tail.

02:34:28.986 --> 02:34:31.403
SAM: We all have tails. Mine's a little longer
than the rest.

02:34:31.403 --> 02:34:35.317
(laughter)

02:34:35.317 --> 02:34:40.333
MATT: Keeping your normal attire, just on the top
of the Draconian form?

02:34:40.333 --> 02:34:43.625
SAM: No! What do Draconians wear?

02:34:43.625 --> 02:34:45.938
LAURA: Rags! Put us in rags, like we've been
living in rubble.

02:34:45.938 --> 02:34:52.626
SAM: Raw silk and tattered clothes, just rags,
terrible gray things.

02:34:52.626 --> 02:34:57.585
LAURA: Make us look like we've been beat up.

02:34:57.585 --> 02:35:02.850
SAM: Sure. We all have a single bruise.

02:35:02.850 --> 02:35:05.044
(laughter)

02:35:05.044 --> 02:35:12.858
SAM: In a different place on our face. Everyone's
got one face bruise in a different place.

02:35:12.858 --> 02:35:23.545
MATT: All of your forms shift into that of various
metallic dragonborn, with tails, adorned in rags,

02:35:23.545 --> 02:35:26.153
dirty. What do you do?

02:35:26.153 --> 02:35:28.364
LAURA: Oh shit, who all speaks Draconic here?

02:35:28.364 --> 02:35:29.904
SAM: You speak Draconic!

02:35:29.904 --> 02:35:33.934
(laughter)

02:35:33.934 --> 02:35:39.911
SAM: We're all mutes. We're lepers and mutes, and
you are our doctor?

02:35:39.911 --> 02:35:43.850
LIAM: Everybody else does fearful anime reacts the
whole time.

02:35:43.850 --> 02:35:47.323
(gasping)

02:35:47.323 --> 02:35:50.464
TRAVIS: (speaking in Japanese)

02:35:50.464 --> 02:35:52.630
LAURA: Don't actually speak Japanese, Grog.

02:35:52.630 --> 02:36:04.493
TALIESIN: We're moving towards the epicenter.

02:36:04.493 --> 02:36:09.690
MATT: You guys step up out of the snow and begin
walking?

02:36:09.690 --> 02:36:12.409
MARISHA: Stealthily.

02:36:12.409 --> 02:36:19.799
LAURA: Okay, I'm stealthily leading us. That
direction, towards where the lair is?

02:36:19.799 --> 02:36:21.691
TRAVIS: Keeping an eye out for trees.

02:36:21.691 --> 02:36:25.814
LAURA: And for any of the lizard creatures coming
towards us.

02:36:25.814 --> 02:36:27.465
MATT: Right now, no.

02:36:27.465 --> 02:36:31.955
LAURA: Then let's quietly make our way that
direction.

02:36:31.955 --> 02:36:34.412
LIAM: Remember, like you've been hit in the
balls.

02:36:34.412 --> 02:36:36.503
TRAVIS: &lt;i&gt;Oh.&lt;/i&gt;

02:36:36.503 --> 02:36:41.799
MATT: You guys cluster up and begin stepping above
the snow, which is still about waist, knee-high

02:36:41.799 --> 02:36:48.259
for some of you. Making your way to the right of
your current location, towards the center of the

02:36:48.259 --> 02:36:56.602
storm that Keyleth discovered. As you guys begin
to walk, a nearby pile of rock and rubble, there

02:36:56.602 --> 02:37:03.117
was that one cluster of four, five of these moving
lizard-like entities. Suddenly, one of them looks

02:37:03.117 --> 02:37:07.175
at your group, looks back at the rest, and they
all stand up and look over in your direction.

02:37:07.175 --> 02:37:15.766
SAM: You're our leader, friend. Do we continue?

02:37:15.766 --> 02:37:18.734
MATT: They're just watching you. They're not doing
anything.

02:37:18.734 --> 02:37:22.968
LAURA: Let's injuredly keep walking.

02:37:22.968 --> 02:37:35.041
MATT: They go back to rummaging through. You guys
continue to walk. The ravine curves to the right,

02:37:35.041 --> 02:37:41.145
or at least begins to open up further to the right
and you're met with the next large structure of

02:37:41.145 --> 02:37:49.747
rubble. What you saw was the edge of an extremely
large, once-floating island, now crushed and

02:37:49.747 --> 02:37:55.643
sundered across the ground. There are sheets of
ice across parts of it. You can see the better

02:37:55.643 --> 02:38:02.043
part of a large palace or library that is now
caved in partially. You can see frozen books

02:38:02.043 --> 02:38:07.841
scattered across portions of the stone and rock on
the ground before you. You can see a series of

02:38:07.841 --> 02:38:13.006
huts have been constructed on top of this rubble,
and there are some small fires lit, little plumes

02:38:13.006 --> 02:38:19.958
of smoke and probably two dozen dragonborn figures
that are currently combing through the rubble.

02:38:19.958 --> 02:38:23.105
LAURA: Do we see any books that seem interesting
as we're walking through them?

02:38:23.105 --> 02:38:27.320
MATT: They're underneath ice. You can try and
chisel some out, if you like.

02:38:27.320 --> 02:38:29.426
LIAM: Don't have time!

02:38:29.426 --> 02:38:35.904
MATT: A lot of it's covered in snow. There's some
bits you can peek through and see sheets of ice

02:38:35.904 --> 02:38:37.022
and frozen books--

02:38:37.022 --> 02:38:42.202
TRAVIS: Are there any frozen bodies?

02:38:42.202 --> 02:38:48.054
MATT: As you begin to have a closer book as you
walk by, there are many frozen bodies. You see

02:38:48.054 --> 02:38:58.797
many people, all dragonborn, some atop the rubble,
some partially crushed, some partially locked in

02:38:58.797 --> 02:39:07.424
ice, some destroyed by some sort of an acidic
substance. Some of them are covered in boils, and

02:39:07.424 --> 02:39:19.476
their face is locked in some sort of horrible
coughing fit. This was a very terrifying battle

02:39:19.476 --> 02:39:21.216
scene that has transpired here.

02:39:21.216 --> 02:39:22.856
LAURA: That means Raishan was here.

02:39:22.856 --> 02:39:24.636
MARISHA: That means Thordak was here.

02:39:24.636 --> 02:39:26.519
LIAM: Umbrasyl was here. Acid.

02:39:26.519 --> 02:39:28.410
MARISHA: They attacked the cities as a horde.

02:39:28.410 --> 02:39:30.103
MATT: There are no signs of anyone burned.

02:39:30.103 --> 02:39:32.173
MARISHA: I thought you said ash.

02:39:32.173 --> 02:39:38.577
LAURA: The people that are scouring through the
rubble, are those dragonborn or just the lizard

02:39:38.577 --> 02:39:39.668
people?

02:39:39.668 --> 02:39:42.513
MATT: Best that you can tell right now, it appears
to be dragonborn.

02:39:42.513 --> 02:39:46.244
LAURA: Can we look at their behavior and see what
it looks like they're doing?

02:39:46.244 --> 02:39:48.374
MATT: Make an insight check.

02:39:48.374 --> 02:39:50.654
TALIESIN: I would like to join that insight
check.

02:39:50.654 --> 02:39:52.739
SAM: I would not like to.

02:39:52.739 --> 02:39:56.423
TALIESIN: Nine.

02:39:56.423 --> 02:39:57.993
LIAM: Nine.

02:39:57.993 --> 02:40:00.167
SAM: I will join that insight check.

02:40:00.167 --> 02:40:01.453
MARISHA: I'll join in, too.

02:40:01.453 --> 02:40:02.747
MATT: You've already said no.

02:40:02.747 --> 02:40:07.013
LAURA: 13. This isn't having to do with dragons?
So it's 13.

02:40:07.013 --> 02:40:15.624
MARISHA: I don't do insight checks too often, I'm
sorry. 22.

02:40:15.624 --> 02:40:18.395
MATT: Did you roll or not?

02:40:18.395 --> 02:40:19.773
TRAVIS: Oh, I rolled a ten.

02:40:19.773 --> 02:40:26.493
MATT: Best you can tell, they're surviving.
They're scouring through the ruins, trying to find

02:40:26.493 --> 02:40:31.588
anything of worth. Some of it's finding wood and
throwing it onto these little flame pyres that are

02:40:31.588 --> 02:40:36.863
scattered around the ruins. You begin to look and
see that actually the sides of the ravine, there

02:40:36.863 --> 02:40:47.243
are hundreds of small caverns are carved into the
rock. Not quite like a dense honeycomb style, but

02:40:47.243 --> 02:40:51.161
it looks like there is an entire cave city that
lives within this ravine.

02:40:51.161 --> 02:40:53.581
LIAM: And they're not frozen over?

02:40:53.581 --> 02:40:56.492
MATT: Some of them are covered in snow.

02:40:56.492 --> 02:41:01.116
LIAM: But snow, not blasted with ice?

02:41:01.116 --> 02:41:02.832
TALIESIN: They look like they're in use?

02:41:02.832 --> 02:41:15.417
MATT: Some of these dragonborn, they're coming out
of their huts. Some of them are still looking up

02:41:15.417 --> 02:41:23.488
at the sky nervously. They look over and see you
guys approaching and a voice calls out, "Who goes there?"

02:41:23.488 --> 02:41:32.858
LAURA: Friends. Friends of Stormwinds.

02:41:32.858 --> 02:41:40.449
MATT: "Friends of Stormwind, you say? We have
friends of Stormwind. Approach."

02:41:40.449 --> 02:41:43.738
LAURA: I walk up injuredly.

02:41:43.738 --> 02:41:47.514
LIAM: I'm hobbling up behind.

02:41:47.514 --> 02:41:49.821
TALIESIN: I'm cowering.

02:41:49.821 --> 02:41:56.011
MATT: You guys cower and approach. Keyleth, Vax,
and Vex, you notice as you approach that a number

02:41:56.011 --> 02:42:02.437
of the people that have all stopped and are paying
attention are beginning to move around and

02:42:02.437 --> 02:42:03.978
encircle you.

02:42:03.978 --> 02:42:14.585
LAURA: Pardon my friends, their tongues have been
cut out by our captors. I'm all that's left.

02:42:14.585 --> 02:42:21.685
MATT: As you walk forward you can see the figure
that's talking to you, a very tall, burly,

02:42:21.685 --> 02:42:34.179
bronze-scaled dragonborn, long horns that protrude
down the back in a slow curvature. No tail. In

02:42:34.179 --> 02:42:38.713
fact, you now notice that every single one of the
dragonborn you've noticed here have no tail.

02:42:38.713 --> 02:42:41.198
SAM: We had a 50-50 chance!

02:42:41.198 --> 02:42:51.955
MATT: "Friends of Stormwind. That would make you
Sky-walkers. I see your tails. You survive the

02:42:51.955 --> 02:43:01.187
"onslaught and step into the den of those you
persecuted. Well, what are your last words?"

02:43:01.187 --> 02:43:03.705
SAM: This was a great plan.

02:43:03.705 --> 02:43:09.280
LIAM: Drop it.

02:43:09.280 --> 02:43:12.261
SAM: I don't know what's going on.

02:43:12.261 --> 02:43:14.813
MARISHA: Is this all being said in Draconic?

02:43:14.813 --> 02:43:17.108
SAM: It's Draconian! I don't know what's
happening.

02:43:17.108 --> 02:43:27.966
LAURA: You know what, I don't know what to tell
you. Everyone with a tail's an asshole. We got

02:43:27.966 --> 02:43:30.047
what was coming to us.

02:43:30.047 --> 02:43:33.999
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

02:43:33.999 --> 02:43:40.120
TALIESIN: Wow!

02:43:40.120 --> 02:43:43.172
LAURA: 19?

02:43:43.172 --> 02:43:53.956
MATT: He turns his head to the side a bit. (spits)
"What skills do you have?"

02:43:53.956 --> 02:43:58.361
LAURA: I can shoot.

02:43:58.361 --> 02:44:02.685
MATT: "Is that all?"

02:44:02.685 --> 02:44:06.122
LAURA: He makes boots.

02:44:06.122 --> 02:44:08.991
MATT: "That's a skill."

02:44:08.991 --> 02:44:13.844
LAURA: She's really good at stonecraft.

02:44:13.844 --> 02:44:18.743
MATT: All the other dragonborn that come behind
you are now holding spears, some of them

02:44:18.743 --> 02:44:23.843
rudimentary-looking pikes that are just held up
and pointed in your direction. You guys are now

02:44:23.843 --> 02:44:38.803
enclosed by about two dozen dragonborn. "Here are
your choices: You die here like the scum you are--"

02:44:38.803 --> 02:44:42.296
LAURA: Choice B.

02:44:42.296 --> 02:44:44.944
MATT: "Then slavery it is."

02:44:44.944 --> 02:44:56.482
(laughter)

02:44:56.482 --> 02:45:01.699
MATT: "You will join the rest of your ilk, and you
will seek food for us. You will know what it's

02:45:01.699 --> 02:45:09.537
"like to be bent beneath the knee of those who do
not deserve it. Put them in chains!"

02:45:09.537 --> 02:45:14.123
LAURA: Oh, they're going to know, as soon as we're
in chains.

02:45:14.123 --> 02:45:16.291
LIAM: Well, we're going to have a fight here.

02:45:16.291 --> 02:45:19.440
LAURA: Oh, shall we drop Seeming? Perhaps we should
drop Seeming?

02:45:19.440 --> 02:45:21.422
SAM: What? Is it going well?

02:45:21.422 --> 02:45:23.514
LAURA: Wait.

02:45:23.514 --> 02:45:28.395
MATT: They approach, and stop for a second. A few
of the folks who came over and went to grab for

02:45:28.395 --> 02:45:30.507
chains have stopped and are holding them in their
hand.

02:45:30.507 --> 02:45:38.101
LAURA: I have to tell you something. We're not
actually Draconian.

02:45:38.101 --> 02:45:45.134
MATT: He leans in and gives you this very keen
look now, and takes a few steps closer. He's about

02:45:45.134 --> 02:45:54.357
five feet from you now. "From where I stand, you
look pretty fucking Draconian to me."

02:45:54.357 --> 02:46:01.647
LAURA: Well, we have some really good magic users
with us. Look, forgive us for making tails. We

02:46:01.647 --> 02:46:07.256
don't know anything about your culture. We're
idiots! We came here because we know you're under

02:46:07.256 --> 02:46:09.495
attack, and we're trying to help.

02:46:09.495 --> 02:46:18.250
MATT: "And you just wander into the caves of the
Ravenites, dressed in the face of those that broke

02:46:18.250 --> 02:46:19.579
"our backs?"

02:46:19.579 --> 02:46:21.301
LAURA: Yep, because we're stupid!

02:46:21.301 --> 02:46:24.642
MATT: Make a persuasion check with disadvantage.

02:46:24.642 --> 02:46:28.658
SAM: Disadvantage. Not good.

02:46:28.658 --> 02:46:32.107
LAURA: 14?

02:46:32.107 --> 02:46:44.466
MATT: 14? "Bring the chains. You have ten seconds
to prove--"

02:46:44.466 --> 02:46:45.944
LAURA: Drop Seeming, just drop it.

02:46:45.944 --> 02:46:48.141
SAM: Really? It's one of my better spells.

02:46:48.141 --> 02:46:49.410
LAURA: I know, I'm sorry!

02:46:49.410 --> 02:46:52.579
SAM: All right, poof. We're back to normal.

02:46:52.579 --> 02:46:58.139
MATT: All of your images fade. Everyone takes a
step back. The spears come up even further, and

02:46:58.139 --> 02:46:59.537
there's a little pause.

02:46:59.537 --> 02:47:01.625
MARISHA: My tail's gone! Bummer.

02:47:01.625 --> 02:47:03.774
LAURA: No, believe me, you don't want the tail.

02:47:03.774 --> 02:47:05.522
MARISHA: But I enjoyed it.

02:47:05.522 --> 02:47:11.000
LIAM: Does this make things better or worse for
us?

02:47:11.000 --> 02:47:13.370
LAURA: I repeat him.

02:47:13.370 --> 02:47:20.466
MATT: Yeah, the reactions you get from them, you
gather most of these don't speak Common and none

02:47:20.466 --> 02:47:22.143
of them seem to understand what you're saying.

02:47:22.143 --> 02:47:29.412
LAURA: Here's the thing. You're being attacked by
a white dragon.

02:47:29.412 --> 02:47:33.368
MATT: "The white dragon came, and he tore down the
Sky-walkers."

02:47:33.368 --> 02:47:35.401
LAURA: So you're happy with it?

02:47:35.401 --> 02:47:40.108
MATT: "Well, it's put us in a better position."

02:47:40.108 --> 02:47:48.772
LAURA: Right. But now that the Sky-walkers have
already been torn down, do you want to keep the

02:47:48.772 --> 02:47:50.625
dragon in charge?

02:47:50.625 --> 02:48:00.888
MATT: "We owe the dragon for the freedom that he
gave us."

02:48:00.888 --> 02:48:07.597
LAURA: So you serve one.

02:48:07.597 --> 02:48:10.028
MATT: "For the time."

02:48:10.028 --> 02:48:15.885
LAURA: And he doesn't punish you at all? He's a
good master?

02:48:15.885 --> 02:48:25.926
MATT: "Those who deserve punishment get it. But we
hunt with it. It brings us power. It promises

02:48:25.926 --> 02:48:34.269
"expansion of the Ravenites, and we will no longer
live under the boot of those in this countryside

02:48:34.269 --> 02:48:36.267
"and this continent."

02:48:36.267 --> 02:48:38.097
LIAM: How's it going?

02:48:38.097 --> 02:48:40.103
LAURA: Really bad.

02:48:40.103 --> 02:48:46.658
MATT: "We have children to feed. We have families
of our own."

02:48:46.658 --> 02:48:51.369
LAURA: How can we help?

02:48:51.369 --> 02:48:53.702
MATT: "How can you help?"

02:48:53.702 --> 02:48:56.206
LAURA: That's what we're here for.

02:48:56.206 --> 02:49:03.214
MATT: "Bring us food, bring us warmth, chop some
firewood. Bring some trees. Work."

02:49:03.214 --> 02:49:08.251
LAURA: Gladly. But not in chains. We do this
freely.

02:49:08.251 --> 02:49:19.994
MATT: "Give us your weapons, and you can walk
freely."

02:49:19.994 --> 02:49:22.842
SAM: Let's kill them all.

02:49:22.842 --> 02:49:28.145
LAURA: I'm sorry, that's not happening.

02:49:28.145 --> 02:49:30.985
MATT: "Then leave."

02:49:30.985 --> 02:49:33.308
LAURA: That we will.

02:49:33.308 --> 02:49:37.503
MATT: "What is your business here, she who wanders
in the faces of others?"

02:49:37.503 --> 02:49:40.135
MARISHA: That's a cool title.

02:49:40.135 --> 02:49:55.839
LAURA: Yeah, add that to the list. Our entire
landscape is under attack. Now, Vorugal has helped

02:49:55.839 --> 02:50:06.180
you, but they've made many others suffer, not just
Draconians. Entire cities brought down, for

02:50:06.180 --> 02:50:17.275
nothing. We're here to right the wrong and help in
any way we can.

02:50:17.275 --> 02:50:24.361
MATT: "You should talk to Tooma."

02:50:24.361 --> 02:50:26.426
LAURA: Tooma.

02:50:26.426 --> 02:50:29.606
MARISHA: Tooma. It is not a tumor.

02:50:29.606 --> 02:50:32.083
LAURA: We knew that was going to happen.

02:50:32.083 --> 02:50:37.715
LIAM: Took about 1.5 seconds to fuck with Matt's
name.

02:50:37.715 --> 02:50:40.860
TALIESIN: I think he &lt;i&gt;assumed&lt;/i&gt;.

02:50:40.860 --> 02:50:49.048
MATT: All you're doing is putting fuel on the
fire.

02:50:49.048 --> 02:50:53.270
(groaning)

02:50:53.270 --> 02:50:54.848
SAM: Is it Tooma?

02:50:54.848 --> 02:50:56.191
MATT: Tooma. T-O-O-M-A.

02:50:56.191 --> 02:50:58.610
LIAM: That's totally different.

02:50:58.610 --> 02:51:03.571
LAURA: Who is Tooma?

02:51:03.571 --> 02:51:19.681
MATT: "Tooma is our chieftain. I'm not to make
this decision. Come. No chains, for now." They all

02:51:19.681 --> 02:51:23.478
stay with their spears still out in front, but
they nudge you forward.

02:51:23.478 --> 02:51:27.373
LAURA: I explain everything that's happening in
Common as we walk. Is everyone still cool with

02:51:27.373 --> 02:51:28.825
this? We're going to the chieftain.

02:51:28.825 --> 02:51:30.899
SAM: Just tell us when it's time to kill
everybody.

02:51:30.899 --> 02:51:32.505
LIAM: We improvise. It's what we do.

02:51:32.505 --> 02:51:36.104
TALIESIN: I think this is actually going far
better than I had hoped.

02:51:36.104 --> 02:51:41.823
SAM: Just remember Vex, ticking time bomb here.
We've got to get in, get out. We've got one day here.

02:51:41.823 --> 02:51:44.531
TRAVIS: Are there any trees that we can see as
we're walking?

02:51:44.531 --> 02:51:49.022
LAURA: They actually said they wanted us to chop
firewood, so if we can get sent on that mission,

02:51:49.022 --> 02:51:50.716
we're set.

02:51:50.716 --> 02:51:52.187
MATT: Make a perception check.

02:51:52.187 --> 02:51:55.487
TRAVIS: Hey, 19!

02:51:55.487 --> 02:52:00.960
LAURA: Are we in the mountains? No. Are we?

02:52:00.960 --> 02:52:02.403
LIAM: 29.

02:52:02.403 --> 02:52:04.634
MATT: You're in a ravine. Perception check was
just for Grog, as he's the only one that asked to

02:52:04.634 --> 02:52:06.691
look for trees. But you rolled a 19?

02:52:06.691 --> 02:52:07.689
TRAVIS: I did!

02:52:07.689 --> 02:52:13.914
MATT: Looking around, occasionally poking out of
the rubble, you'll see a tree. Most of them seem

02:52:13.914 --> 02:52:19.401
to have not fared so well with the cold weather
and have been snapped or broken in the process of

02:52:19.401 --> 02:52:25.361
the falling rubble. You do make out, towards the
edge on the other side of the ravine, beyond this

02:52:25.361 --> 02:52:31.142
giant one, you can see this one island, one larger
island of the cluster that made up Draconia, fell

02:52:31.142 --> 02:52:35.202
in the center here and is broken apart. On the far
end, you can see there's a small cluster of trees,

02:52:35.202 --> 02:52:39.015
the hint of green still to them, some of them
varying thickness.

02:52:39.015 --> 02:52:41.903
MARISHA: I could work with that.

02:52:41.903 --> 02:52:44.699
TRAVIS: Might be a long way, though.

02:52:44.699 --> 02:52:51.951
LIAM: We've been here, what, ten minutes?

02:52:51.951 --> 02:52:54.911
MATT: I'd say about 20.

02:52:54.911 --> 02:53:00.684
SAM: So we're going to go see Tooma, or we're
going to chop down some fucking trees?

02:53:00.684 --> 02:53:04.316
LAURA: We have to go. They're walking us to the
chieftain. Can't just walk away now.

02:53:04.316 --> 02:53:09.205
MATT: You guys are prodded along, over the rubble,
and as you come around you can start to see, where

02:53:09.205 --> 02:53:16.711
the outside of the island is broken rock, the
center of it is broken structures. Buildings,

02:53:16.711 --> 02:53:24.911
homes, giant great marble halls, everything is
mostly fallen in. You still see some structures

02:53:24.911 --> 02:53:31.143
standing, but at odd angles. There are sections of
buildings that still show the outer outline of

02:53:31.143 --> 02:53:42.491
what once stood, but it is all a complete ruin.
You do see every now and then a few large spikes

02:53:42.491 --> 02:53:48.853
of ice that are jutting out of portions, and you
see bodies that are jabbed onto the spikes and

02:53:48.853 --> 02:53:50.661
left to freeze.

02:53:50.661 --> 02:53:52.193
LAURA: Do they have tails?

02:53:52.193 --> 02:54:07.504
MATT: They do. You move over the bulk of this
giant pile of rubble and begin to descend the

02:54:07.504 --> 02:54:18.452
other side, and you can see now there is an active
village here that is half-frozen entirely. Half of

02:54:18.452 --> 02:54:27.047
it seems to be abandoned; the other half of it is
completely coated in solid ice. The crowd leads

02:54:27.047 --> 02:54:33.772
you past that abandoned village to a series of
tunnels against the wall, maybe 300 or 400 feet

02:54:33.772 --> 02:54:43.576
past that cluster of trees that you saw. Leads you
into this tunnel, and on the inside, there are small

02:54:43.576 --> 02:54:50.658
glow stones set in portions of the stone. Not
naturally forming, but essentially small natural

02:54:50.658 --> 02:54:54.907
bits of torchlight just pressed into the stonework
to give some sort of a light source.

02:54:54.907 --> 02:55:05.696
You're led in for about five or so minutes. and
you see other offshoot tunnels. It's like a giant

02:55:05.696 --> 02:55:14.490
anthill weaved throughout this, and you can see
rudimentary furniture made of wood and stone, with

02:55:14.490 --> 02:55:19.505
limestone rock, whatever's available within the
actual ravine here.

02:55:19.505 --> 02:55:24.701
MARISHA: Can I get a sense on when this was
carved? If this was carved recently or if this has

02:55:24.701 --> 02:55:26.397
been here a while?

02:55:26.397 --> 02:55:28.514
MATT: Make a nature check.

02:55:28.514 --> 02:55:32.980
MARISHA: Ooh, 27.

02:55:32.980 --> 02:55:38.181
MATT: Best you can tell from looking at the rock
and knowing the amount of erosion versus the

02:55:38.181 --> 02:55:51.408
curvature of it, these tunnels have been here for
a very long time. This portion opens up and you

02:55:51.408 --> 02:56:03.080
can see now there is a much more refined,
village-type structure inside, maybe 30-plus small

02:56:03.080 --> 02:56:08.488
homes carved from rock and stone. Built much
better than the makeshift huts that you saw

02:56:08.488 --> 02:56:19.510
outside. You also see a giant pile of broken
chains to the left side of the entryway. Many of

02:56:19.510 --> 02:56:26.456
them are manacles and neck vices that are just
thrown and discarded in this large pile.

02:56:26.456 --> 02:56:30.983
MARISHA: Tiberius never mentioned this side of
Draconia.

02:56:30.983 --> 02:56:40.543
MATT: As you are brought into the center of this
larger chamber you see two dozen Draconians that

02:56:40.543 --> 02:56:44.838
are out and about just currently gathering
materials, talking and walking, and stop and see as you

02:56:44.838 --> 02:56:54.076
enter and just watch as you pass by. Colors range
from metallic to chromatic, all spectrum; it's a

02:56:54.076 --> 02:56:56.905
mish-mash of all walks and sizes.

02:56:56.905 --> 02:57:01.936
LIAM: And the chromatic-- the red, the blue, the
green-- are we seeing tails on them?

02:57:01.936 --> 02:57:03.099
MATT: Nope.

02:57:03.099 --> 02:57:04.568
MARISHA: No tails.

02:57:04.568 --> 02:57:06.857
LAURA: Nobody has tails down here.

02:57:06.857 --> 02:57:12.164
SAM: I could make us all Draconian again without
tails.

02:57:12.164 --> 02:57:14.559
LAURA: That would probably work at this point,
right?

02:57:14.559 --> 02:57:20.658
MATT: You're led past a couple of these stone
structures and there is a central, open circular

02:57:20.658 --> 02:57:30.487
plot between a lot of these. There's a fountain
that seems to spring a very clean source of water

02:57:30.487 --> 02:57:37.223
within the center of this chamber. Beyond that,
there is a larger temple-like square structure

02:57:37.223 --> 02:57:43.916
that has a slight trapezoidal appearance to it.
The entranceway is an open arch, and you can see a

02:57:43.916 --> 02:57:47.047
large fire burning on the inside of it.

02:57:47.047 --> 02:57:55.791
You are led around the fountain and led to the
inside. There, sitting on a large stone seat made

02:57:55.791 --> 02:58:02.980
of haphazard bits of rock and stone, it looks
relatively uncomfortable, a large stone throne,

02:58:02.980 --> 02:58:15.365
there is a female dragonborn. She wears long,
drab, gray robes, tattered at the edges, a hood

02:58:15.365 --> 02:58:22.069
loosely pulled back and a large scarf or wrap
around her neck and shoulders. She just sits there

02:58:22.069 --> 02:58:26.472
with her hands over the side, draped, and as you
walk in and your eyes adjust you can see that she

02:58:26.472 --> 02:58:36.488
looks very old. As you're brought in, the rest of
your crew still pushes you in with the spears. She

02:58:36.488 --> 02:58:43.810
leans forward. "Are these prisoners of ours?"

02:58:43.810 --> 02:58:55.249
The dragonborn who brought you in goes, "They are,
for the time being. They say they come here

02:58:55.249 --> 02:59:11.352
"because the Frigid Doom and other dragons who came
are killing their people, as well. They have come

02:59:11.352 --> 02:59:24.813
"to fight the dragon, or so they claim. They walked
in under guise of our enemy. It is your wisdom to

02:59:24.813 --> 02:59:30.479
"make these choices." And the larger dragonborn
bows his head and steps away, the spears pull back

02:59:30.479 --> 02:59:35.287
and they step, blocking the exits that you walked
through; the entire archway now is shoulder to

02:59:35.287 --> 02:59:37.755
shoulder dragonborn with spears at the ready.

02:59:37.755 --> 02:59:48.637
LAURA: Tooma. We apologize for coming in the guise
of your enemies. Unfortunately, we don't know much

02:59:48.637 --> 02:59:57.511
about your culture, and no one ever informed us of
what you have suffered, and we apologize.

02:59:57.511 --> 03:00:03.407
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

03:00:03.407 --> 03:00:09.600
LAURA: 23?

03:00:09.600 --> 03:00:18.283
MATT: You're saying this in Draconic, I assume?
She leans in a bit, and the firelight crackles

03:00:18.283 --> 03:00:26.108
under her chin, and you can see the teeth on one
side pull out beyond the lip, and it gives her

03:00:26.108 --> 03:00:40.772
this lopsided look. The tongue wipes across the
front, and she leans in toward you. "You come here

03:00:40.772 --> 03:00:44.025
"to fight the Frigid Doom, you say?"

03:00:44.025 --> 03:00:47.365
LAURA: Yes.

03:00:47.365 --> 03:00:58.524
MATT: "I would be lying if I said it did not bring
a chance for freedom to all of us Ravenites."

03:00:58.524 --> 03:01:00.922
LAURA: Much deserved.

03:01:00.922 --> 03:01:17.159
MATT: "But as time progresses, I fear we shake one
bond to step into another. The dragon presented

03:01:17.159 --> 03:01:27.515
"itself as our savior, but has since required an
ever-growing fealty."

03:01:27.515 --> 03:01:30.078
LAURA: They do that.

03:01:30.078 --> 03:01:41.671
MATT: "Without the Draconians, without the
Sky-walkers, and without the Doom, we would be

03:01:41.671 --> 03:01:49.816
"free. Rebuild our culture."

03:01:49.816 --> 03:01:56.074
LAURA: I want nothing more for you than that. Let
us help you.

03:01:56.074 --> 03:02:05.318
MATT: Now, the rest of you hear this: "Do your
friends speak Common?"

03:02:05.318 --> 03:02:07.771
TALIESIN: Oh, that's lovely.

03:02:07.771 --> 03:02:08.817
MARISHA: Hi!

03:02:08.817 --> 03:02:10.023
SAM: Hi, yes.

03:02:10.023 --> 03:02:11.611
LAURA: Much relieved. Yes, they do.

03:02:11.611 --> 03:02:12.951
SAM: Grog doesn't, but we do.

03:02:12.951 --> 03:02:15.680
TRAVIS: (moans)

03:02:15.680 --> 03:02:22.458
(laughter)

03:02:22.458 --> 03:02:39.797
MATT: "If we are to let you go, do you promise to
slay this creature?"

03:02:39.797 --> 03:02:45.006
LAURA: We will do everything in our power to watch
it die.

03:02:45.006 --> 03:02:47.691
LIAM: It is our only purpose.

03:02:47.691 --> 03:02:50.721
MATT: "It has been gone for days."

03:02:50.721 --> 03:02:52.861
LAURA: It should be back very soon.

03:02:52.861 --> 03:02:55.508
MATT: "Took most of its army with it."

03:02:55.508 --> 03:02:58.295
SAM: Grog was right! He's always right!

03:02:58.295 --> 03:03:06.371
TALIESIN: That was our hope, that we would be able
to come here when it was at its weakest and get a

03:03:06.371 --> 03:03:07.404
sense of it.

03:03:07.404 --> 03:03:10.103
SAM: Do you know where its lair is?

03:03:10.103 --> 03:03:11.384
MATT: "I do."

03:03:11.384 --> 03:03:14.019
SAM: Is it far?

03:03:14.019 --> 03:03:18.016
MATT: "It is not far, but one hour walk."

03:03:18.016 --> 03:03:19.841
LAURA: Can I roll an insight check on her?

03:03:19.841 --> 03:03:21.625
MATT: You may.

03:03:21.625 --> 03:03:26.199
LAURA: 19.

03:03:26.199 --> 03:03:27.684
MATT: 19?

03:03:27.684 --> 03:03:30.024
SAM: (gasps) Oh boy.

03:03:30.024 --> 03:03:36.020
TALIESIN: Do you know what I like as much as
whispers? Loot Crate.

03:03:36.020 --> 03:03:42.526
SAM: What? Taliesin. You've got to do better than
that. Try something like this: You know, Matt's an

03:03:42.526 --> 03:03:47.373
asshole, but you know who's not? The good people
at Loot Crate.

03:03:47.373 --> 03:03:53.286
TALIESIN: Loot Crate doesn't decide to just tell one
person about what's going on. They let everyone

03:03:53.286 --> 03:03:56.846
know, not just Vex.

03:03:56.846 --> 03:04:01.261
SAM: Hey, you never told us what he whispered to
you before.

03:04:01.261 --> 03:04:02.903
MATT: No, he didn't.

03:04:02.903 --> 03:04:04.966
LIAM: We're good.

03:04:04.966 --> 03:04:06.569
SAM: Oh boy.

03:04:06.569 --> 03:04:09.677
LIAM: I'm a vampire. Just deal with it.

03:04:09.677 --> 03:04:17.133
MATT: "If you come here to kill this dragon, I
assume you have the means and a plan."

03:04:17.133 --> 03:04:19.308
SAM: We definitely have plans.

03:04:19.308 --> 03:04:21.066
MARISHA: Totally have a plan.

03:04:21.066 --> 03:04:22.835
MATT: "Then let us set an ambush."

03:04:22.835 --> 03:04:25.289
SAM: Ambush? Sorry?

03:04:25.289 --> 03:04:26.975
MARISHA: Come again?

03:04:26.975 --> 03:04:39.793
LAURA: Well, we tried to do that one other time.
While it did pay off, and its brother is dead, a

03:04:39.793 --> 03:04:45.340
lot of people died in the process. A lot. Very
large, strong people.

03:04:45.340 --> 03:04:52.574
MATT: "So what do you insist? We not have an
ambush, we just wait for it to land and attack head-on?"

03:04:52.574 --> 03:05:04.066
SAM: We were going to use this opportunity to find
our way into its lair and find its weaknesses, and plan.

03:05:04.066 --> 03:05:06.798
MARISHA: Sabotage, from the inside.

03:05:06.798 --> 03:05:10.138
TALIESIN: There's more than one dragon, and they
are supporting each other.

03:05:10.138 --> 03:05:15.523
MARISHA: We kill this one, it'll set off a chain
reaction that we might not be able to recover from

03:05:15.523 --> 03:05:17.493
if we're not fully prepared.

03:05:17.493 --> 03:05:25.455
TALIESIN: We want to make the means to make sure
that when the time comes, we can destroy them all

03:05:25.455 --> 03:05:27.343
in one fell swoop.

03:05:27.343 --> 03:05:32.241
LAURA: The risk here is that by destroying
Vorugal--

03:05:32.241 --> 03:05:37.103
SAM: The Frigid Doom.

03:05:37.103 --> 03:05:41.086
LAURA: We'll bring the wrath of the others upon
you.

03:05:41.086 --> 03:05:42.745
TALIESIN: He is not the strongest.

03:05:42.745 --> 03:05:47.842
LAURA: Thordak is much larger, and I don't think
he's been here.

03:05:47.842 --> 03:05:55.281
MATT: "You speak with accents I do not understand.
Where do you come from?"

03:05:55.281 --> 03:05:56.974
TALIESIN: Everywhere.

03:05:56.974 --> 03:05:58.393
MARISHA: We're a motley crew.

03:05:58.393 --> 03:06:01.483
LAURA: Lots of different places.

03:06:01.483 --> 03:06:03.435
TRAVIS: Do not answer that question.

03:06:03.435 --> 03:06:05.821
TALIESIN: We can answer the continent.

03:06:05.821 --> 03:06:09.322
LAURA: As you can see, we're half-elves.

03:06:09.322 --> 03:06:22.847
MATT: "We are to walk to the den. We are to learn
your information. Then what?"

03:06:22.847 --> 03:06:29.574
TALIESIN: Set up a situation where we can monitor
you and possibly contact you when it's time, and

03:06:29.574 --> 03:06:33.506
even let you know if we think the dragon's about
to leave, so that you can prepare.

03:06:33.506 --> 03:06:45.846
MATT: "I have lived to see this day by not being
deceived or tricked. You speak words that are not

03:06:45.846 --> 03:06:56.360
"direct. They wind. They spin. They circle. What
guarantee do I have that you will not just flee?"

03:06:56.360 --> 03:07:02.845
MARISHA: To be fair, what guarantee do we have
that you won't kill us, and the ambush was meant

03:07:02.845 --> 03:07:07.703
for us? I believe there is untrust on both sides.

03:07:07.703 --> 03:07:15.572
MATT: At which point, she steps off of the throne,
steps on both of her feet, and when she's off the

03:07:15.572 --> 03:07:22.832
throne, her imposing form becomes far less
imposing. You can see now there's a very heavy

03:07:22.832 --> 03:07:31.390
hunch to her back, and as she scuffles forward,
she's an almost pitiful-looking sight, physically.

03:07:31.390 --> 03:07:39.334
As she pulls forward to walk straight to you,
Keyleth, you see the somewhat clouded,

03:07:39.334 --> 03:07:50.823
cataract-ridden eyes of the dragonborn female
Tooma. She comes up to you and goes, "We are a

03:07:50.823 --> 03:07:59.186
"proud people, even when pressed into the dirt for
as many years as we have been. We reclaim our

03:07:59.186 --> 03:08:09.252
"honor. We reclaim our place in this world. We wish
to do this as peacefully as possible, but we have

03:08:09.252 --> 03:08:15.787
"been forced to scrounge and survive through this
freedom. We wish you no folly. We wish you no ill

03:08:15.787 --> 03:08:21.830
"will. But we also have learned that trust needs to
be earned; it cannot be spoken and given so

03:08:21.830 --> 03:08:33.944
"freely. Both ways. You are right to mistrust, as
are we of you. But that is the impasse. One must

03:08:33.944 --> 03:08:37.855
"have faith, in one way or another, if there is to
be a compromise."

03:08:37.855 --> 03:08:45.442
MARISHA: I think faith and trust are not mutually
exclusive. I can not trust you and still have

03:08:45.442 --> 03:08:52.682
faith, and you should not feel lack of pride for
living in the dirt, or surviving. There's nothing

03:08:52.682 --> 03:09:00.382
wrong with that. But I understand your urge to
want to rebuild, become the great culture that I

03:09:00.382 --> 03:09:10.400
know you all are. So you should at least trust
that we have similar interests in the end.

03:09:10.400 --> 03:09:15.096
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

03:09:15.096 --> 03:09:20.585
MARISHA: Ooh! 19!

03:09:20.585 --> 03:09:22.199
SAM: Was that opal?

03:09:22.199 --> 03:09:23.863
TALIESIN: Yes, it was.

03:09:23.863 --> 03:09:27.126
MARISHA: Opal's back! 25.

03:09:27.126 --> 03:09:35.086
MATT: 25. She reaches forward and extends a finger
that gently scrapes the bottom of the chin, not

03:09:35.086 --> 03:09:40.283
too much to hurt, but to go across the skin and
pull your chin upward into the light of the fire a

03:09:40.283 --> 03:09:54.368
little bit. "There is much wisdom in there for so
young a face. All right. There are not many

03:09:54.368 --> 03:10:08.140
"options we have, either. Come. We will walk. And
at the very least, if you decide to flee, never return."

03:10:08.140 --> 03:10:12.805
MARISHA: We can give you that word.

03:10:12.805 --> 03:10:19.934
LAURA: Tooma. Are the Frigid Doom's armies around?
Will they see us?

03:10:19.934 --> 03:10:29.919
MATT: "There are a handful of dregs that stayed
behind, but you tell me you wear many faces."

03:10:29.919 --> 03:10:32.985
LAURA: We certainly don't want them to see ours.

03:10:32.985 --> 03:10:35.583
SAM: What should we disguise ourselves as?

03:10:35.583 --> 03:10:42.764
MATT: She points past, over your head, and goes,
"Tiny gnome, the faces of those that lead you here."

03:10:42.764 --> 03:10:54.628
SAM: Okay, tiny is uncalled for, but I understand.
The faces of your tribe, of your clan. All right.

03:10:54.628 --> 03:10:57.884
MATT: "Be glad you walk with one as wise."

03:10:57.884 --> 03:11:03.226
MARISHA: Is she talking about me? That's awesome!

03:11:03.226 --> 03:11:08.171
MATT: She begins to shuffle over, and you watch as
two of the dragonborn walk over and scoop her up

03:11:08.171 --> 03:11:15.451
shoulder to shoulder, and she shrugs them off and
pushes them away. "I can walk myself." She begins

03:11:15.451 --> 03:11:19.995
shuffling, and they separate and open. She walks
partway out as you guys stand there, and turns

03:11:19.995 --> 03:11:22.526
around and beckons. "Well, come."

03:11:22.526 --> 03:11:24.093
TRAVIS: We follow.

03:11:24.093 --> 03:11:25.709
LAURA: Can you cast Seeming again?

03:11:25.709 --> 03:11:30.089
SAM: I can do Seeming one more time. All right.

03:11:30.089 --> 03:11:32.348
LAURA: Wait, if you cast Seeming, will we still be
able to get into the--

03:11:32.348 --> 03:11:40.324
SAM: We've still got the mansion. Handicaps me a
bit, but I will cast Seeming again on the party

03:11:40.324 --> 03:11:45.441
and do the same thing, except slightly different
colors and slightly less tail.

03:11:45.441 --> 03:11:50.307
(laughter)

03:11:50.307 --> 03:11:54.161
MATT: The larger dragonborn that let you in--

03:11:54.161 --> 03:12:10.346
SAM: My tail nub is slightly larger than the rest.
It's a cube. It's a tail cube.

03:12:10.346 --> 03:12:15.845
MATT: As the rest of the guards circle around and
begin to walk, a little bit of trepidation, but

03:12:15.845 --> 03:12:23.452
going along with Tooma, the large one who let you
in goes, "Tooma. Are you certain?"

03:12:23.452 --> 03:12:32.145
She turns around and goes, "Skork, there are few
things that are certain in this world. I am not

03:12:32.145 --> 03:12:39.053
"long for it, but if we are not to seize the
opportunity of kinship, we miss the opportunity

03:12:39.053 --> 03:12:48.618
"for survival. Is it a risk? Yes. Sometimes it's a
risk worth taking." And she keeps walking. The

03:12:48.618 --> 03:12:56.352
rest of them gather behind, and the now-named
Skork gives a nod and continues walking along.

03:12:56.352 --> 03:12:57.864
SAM: Have we heard of Skork?

03:12:57.864 --> 03:12:59.191
MARISHA: Is that his name?

03:12:59.191 --> 03:13:01.746
LAURA: He was the guy that we talked to right when
we got here.

03:13:01.746 --> 03:13:09.082
MATT: Yeah. You guys are led out of the tunnel,
back into the freezing air. The wind has picked up

03:13:09.082 --> 03:13:16.751
a bit, and you can now hear this low hum as it
hits certain portions of the cavern and causes low

03:13:16.751 --> 03:13:23.754
vibrational whistles in the distance. The snow has
begun to fall a little heavier now, and as you

03:13:23.754 --> 03:13:26.841
walk out, you can hear the crunch of your
footsteps as you're stepping through heavier and

03:13:26.841 --> 03:13:28.630
heavier blankets of snow.

03:13:28.630 --> 03:13:38.938
LAURA: Can I tell Tooma, as we walk out: P.S., if
that dragon comes back, we need to bolt.

03:13:38.938 --> 03:13:47.980
MATT: She nods. "If that dragon comes back, we
never saw you, you never saw us."

03:13:47.980 --> 03:13:49.983
LAURA: Thank you.

03:13:49.983 --> 03:13:55.170
MATT: She's very slow, by the way. Your passage of
travel is about half speed as she leads the

03:13:55.170 --> 03:13:57.930
charge, but everyone respectfully keeps in pace
with her.

03:13:57.930 --> 03:14:03.396
SAM: Tooma, have you ever heard of a dragonborn
named Gern Blanston?

03:14:03.396 --> 03:14:10.787
MATT: She thinks for a second. "That name has not
come to my mind, no."

03:14:10.787 --> 03:14:14.331
SAM: Us neither.

03:14:14.331 --> 03:14:28.571
MATT: Pushing on, it's gotten a little lighter in
the sky. You figure, based on your arrival, you

03:14:28.571 --> 03:14:33.984
may have just come in at the cusp of dawn, and the
sun has now gotten higher in the sky. You're on

03:14:33.984 --> 03:14:39.611
the entire opposite side of the planet now, so the
cycle has changed based on the location you're

03:14:39.611 --> 03:14:48.791
currently in. Well, you had rested, actually. You
left in the morning. You would've gotten here--

03:14:48.791 --> 03:14:53.690
actually, opposite of that. It's actually now
getting to dusk. Even though it's only been a

03:14:53.690 --> 03:14:58.933
couple of hours of daylight that you've seen since
you woke up this morning, it's already beginning

03:14:58.933 --> 03:15:01.368
to set, and the sky is getting darker.

03:15:01.368 --> 03:15:05.039
LAURA: We lost a day, but the dragon will still
take the same amount of time.

03:15:05.039 --> 03:15:06.976
LIAM: Ugh. I'm so tree-lagged, though.

03:15:06.976 --> 03:15:10.617
MARISHA: I know. Always sucks going west to east.

03:15:10.617 --> 03:15:20.955
MATT: You're led over a portion of the ravine,
ever so slowly, that lifts up, and then as you get

03:15:20.955 --> 03:15:24.906
to the crest, it bends down into a far deeper and
wider portion of the ravine. This is now the

03:15:24.906 --> 03:15:36.808
center part of this entire giant physical anomaly
that is this giant crack in the ground, and you

03:15:36.808 --> 03:15:40.779
can see the bulk of the fallen city is in the
center of this area.

03:15:40.779 --> 03:15:42.736
LAURA: Do we see any big trees around here?

03:15:42.736 --> 03:15:50.945
MATT: You see a couple of larger trees that sprout
out from the rubble. There's ones that managed to

03:15:50.945 --> 03:15:55.327
survive the impact of certain areas of stone,
though it looks like a lot of the bark has been

03:15:55.327 --> 03:16:00.985
stripped, and they might not be alive that you can
see from this distance. There are smaller trees

03:16:00.985 --> 03:16:05.128
towards the edge, and a few still protruding from
portions of the walls.

03:16:05.128 --> 03:16:07.383
SAM: Note every tree as we walk by.

03:16:07.383 --> 03:16:13.587
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm paying attention to the trees.
That's the biggest tree that's now closest to us.

03:16:13.587 --> 03:16:17.709
Now &lt;i&gt;that's&lt;/i&gt; the biggest tree that's now closest
to us. Now that one.

03:16:17.709 --> 03:16:23.957
MATT: As you're led down into the ravine, you
reach this central structure, and you can already

03:16:23.957 --> 03:16:31.130
see from this distance, as the snow falls, hitting
and covering the rocks, there are dozens and

03:16:31.130 --> 03:16:39.150
dozens of those spikes of ice jutting out of the
rock, each with one or two various frozen corpses

03:16:39.150 --> 03:16:47.741
impaled on them and left. At the top of this, you
can see a large cluster of ice that is in a

03:16:47.741 --> 03:17:00.006
somewhat round gathering, and you can see--
actually, no, you don't see that. Sorry. A note

03:17:00.006 --> 03:17:01.885
that will come into play in the future.

03:17:01.885 --> 03:17:06.870
TRAVIS: Can I ask a question? The bodies on the
spikes. None of them look familiar, right?

03:17:06.870 --> 03:17:14.987
MATT: You can keep watch as you go. You push
towards the center of the ravine, and upon the

03:17:14.987 --> 03:17:24.282
large island of rubble, you begin to move, and it
takes a good 40, 50 minutes, an hour, to traverse,

03:17:24.282 --> 03:17:29.280
a lot further than you would've expected in that
time period. Sorry, a lot less than you figured

03:17:29.280 --> 03:17:36.810
you would traverse in that time, being weighed
down by Tooma's gait. However, the rubble begins

03:17:36.810 --> 03:17:45.597
to subside, and you begin to see steps of ice. Not
perfect, carved steps, but elements of

03:17:45.597 --> 03:17:58.435
encapsulated broken platforms of ice that act as
stairs. Vax, Vex, and Keyleth, as you guys begin

03:17:58.435 --> 03:18:03.404
to move up the steps, and you especially, Vex, you
can see, with what little bit of light is

03:18:03.404 --> 03:18:15.763
beginning to shine down through the ice, you can
see mounds and mounds of coins and jewel boxes and

03:18:15.763 --> 03:18:30.339
many expensive knick-knacks and collections, all
below feet of solid ice, all clustered towards the

03:18:30.339 --> 03:18:35.706
apex of this collapsed, ruined island.

03:18:35.706 --> 03:18:45.593
LAURA: Tooma, is Vorugal having you collect all of
this?

03:18:45.593 --> 03:18:58.670
MATT: "Vorugal sends us to pay the debt we owe for
being freed, yes. We scavenge. We spend our days

03:18:58.670 --> 03:19:07.970
"searching for food, for the means to survive, and
finding what we can from the ruins of the broken

03:19:07.970 --> 03:19:09.297
"Draconia."

03:19:09.297 --> 03:19:13.213
LAURA: And when you can't find anything? What
then?

03:19:13.213 --> 03:19:25.597
MATT: "These are the thoughts that consume me. It
is the reason you are still alive." Everyone make

03:19:25.597 --> 03:19:27.580
a perception check.

03:19:27.580 --> 03:19:38.309
SAM: Yeah, dog! 14!

03:19:38.309 --> 03:19:40.190
MARISHA: 28.

03:19:40.190 --> 03:19:41.595
TALIESIN: Natural 20.

03:19:41.595 --> 03:19:43.989
SAM: That wasn't the golden snitch?

03:19:43.989 --> 03:19:47.616
TALIESIN: No, I put the golden snitch away for the
evening.

03:19:47.616 --> 03:19:50.704
LAURA: I got a natural 20 when I dropped it.
Giving up on it.

03:19:50.704 --> 03:19:57.287
MATT: As you guys begin to approach, you can see
now the ice that encases the golden coins begins

03:19:57.287 --> 03:20:01.757
to ripple upward, and it's getting harder and
harder to climb. You can see now, it comes to an

03:20:01.757 --> 03:20:07.181
apex in this bowl-like formation, and as you get
to a point where it's harder to ascend, you can

03:20:07.181 --> 03:20:12.948
see Tooma stops and sees that she can't go much
further, and she points up and goes, "That is

03:20:12.948 --> 03:20:21.839
"where it sleeps. That is where we come to give
what we find. And that is where it should fall."

03:20:21.839 --> 03:20:34.226
LAURA: What is its nature? Is it vain? Does it
want you to bow before it?

03:20:34.226 --> 03:20:51.181
MATT: "It does not ask for kneeling. It asks for
fear and respect. It asks us to bring the most

03:20:51.181 --> 03:20:54.849
"powerful creatures in the land for it to chase."

03:20:54.849 --> 03:21:08.231
LAURA: Can I roll an insight check on her again?
Jesus. This is creepy. 27.

03:21:08.231 --> 03:21:14.917
MATT: 27.

03:21:14.917 --> 03:21:16.743
LIAM: So the box is full of loot?

03:21:16.743 --> 03:21:18.690
SAM: No, it's a crate, Liam.

03:21:18.690 --> 03:21:21.140
LIAM: The crate is full of boxes?

03:21:21.140 --> 03:21:28.683
SAM: Yes. A crate full of boxes. Box Crate, our
best sponsor. Inside the boxes are tinier boxes.

03:21:28.683 --> 03:21:31.318
LIAM: When do you get to the loot, though?

03:21:31.318 --> 03:21:34.882
SAM: No, it's a Russian nesting doll of boxes and
crates.

03:21:34.882 --> 03:21:36.199
LIAM: Box-box.

03:21:36.199 --> 03:21:40.794
SAM: Box-box, and then inside is a box-crate, and
inside that is tiny-bag-crate.

03:21:40.794 --> 03:21:44.141
LAURA: What are you guys talking about?

03:21:44.141 --> 03:21:47.256
SAM: Liam! Do you want all those boxes?

03:21:47.256 --> 03:21:48.971
LIAM: I need boxes.

03:21:48.971 --> 03:21:57.965
SAM: You get $3 off the first box of boxes.
Crate-crate.

03:21:57.965 --> 03:22:09.804
MATT: All right. So. "This is its home. This is
its shrine."

03:22:09.804 --> 03:22:15.085
LAURA: Check for fucking traps before we go in
there.

03:22:15.085 --> 03:22:17.450
SAM: Is it up? Is it down? Is it through?

03:22:17.450 --> 03:22:23.229
MATT: The top comes into this giant bowl, this
platform of ice, and it's almost like a nest where

03:22:23.229 --> 03:22:24.453
it sits.

03:22:24.453 --> 03:22:25.745
TRAVIS: A big icy dog bed.

03:22:25.745 --> 03:22:31.112
SAM: By the way, we've been in dragons' lairs
before, and the lairs themselves do things, right?

03:22:31.112 --> 03:22:33.634
LIAM: Yes, with the dragon in them.

03:22:33.634 --> 03:22:37.417
SAM: But when the dragon's not in them they don't
do anything?

03:22:37.417 --> 03:22:42.126
LIAM: My sister and I are going to have a look
around. I have a question for you, though. If we

03:22:42.126 --> 03:22:51.665
make a stand here today, in theory, is it worth it
to you to stand with us?

03:22:51.665 --> 03:22:55.952
MATT: "If you feel confident. Otherwise, we walk
to our death prematurely."

03:22:55.952 --> 03:23:01.533
LAURA: Yeah, let's not do that today. This is
reconnaissance.

03:23:01.533 --> 03:23:05.320
TALIESIN: If all goes well, we will have one more
conversation.

03:23:05.320 --> 03:23:10.143
LIAM: All right. I'm going to start searching the
ground for traps.

03:23:10.143 --> 03:23:16.359
TALIESIN: I do have one other question: The bodies
on the spikes. How did that happen? What was that?

03:23:16.359 --> 03:23:27.237
MATT: "When the islands fell, there was a great
fight of those that survived against the dragon.

03:23:27.237 --> 03:23:43.923
"We did not join in, out of fear, and out of not
knowing which side would come out. Vorugal stayed

03:23:43.923 --> 03:23:55.400
"behind as the other two flew. The dragon asked us
why we do not fight. We said, 'Because it is not

03:23:55.400 --> 03:24:07.289
"'our place.' The dragon said, 'Well, your place is
now that of free kin.' The dragon summoned forth

03:24:07.289 --> 03:24:20.803
"these spikes, and drove it through the hearts of
many of the Sky-walkers. Many of us cheered, for

03:24:20.803 --> 03:24:30.884
"it was a symbol that many had wished to see for a
long time, but at the same time, the older ones of

03:24:30.884 --> 03:24:45.432
"us... It was not what we wanted. It was not how we
wished to be freed. But we had no way of stopping

03:24:45.432 --> 03:24:56.909
"him. As time went on, and with each surviving
Sky-walker that was found, there were no more

03:24:56.909 --> 03:25:10.482
"cheers. Just the dread of knowing that maybe in
time, when all the spikes are filled, it may be us

03:25:10.482 --> 03:25:12.551
"on them next."

03:25:12.551 --> 03:25:15.464
TALIESIN: Thank you.

03:25:15.464 --> 03:25:20.324
LIAM: 29. Looking for any traps.

03:25:20.324 --> 03:25:25.593
MATT: Okay. You spend the next 15 minutes or so,
20 minutes, skirting around the outside of this

03:25:25.593 --> 03:25:38.001
large frozen bowl, looking for some semblance of a
set trap. You don't recognize anything as any sort

03:25:38.001 --> 03:25:43.138
of mechanism placed that would set off your
warning defense systems as a rogue.

03:25:43.138 --> 03:25:53.991
LAURA: Can I stand on the top and look out from
the platform and see what is visible from the

03:25:53.991 --> 03:25:57.441
platform and what areas seem hidden in the
landscape?

03:25:57.441 --> 03:25:59.735
TALIESIN: I'm going to join you on that.

03:25:59.735 --> 03:26:01.613
MATT: Both of you guys roll perception checks.

03:26:01.613 --> 03:26:03.244
SAM: I have an idea.

03:26:03.244 --> 03:26:04.664
TALIESIN: Natural 20.

03:26:04.664 --> 03:26:06.343
MARISHA: Natural fucking 20.

03:26:06.343 --> 03:26:09.165
LAURA: I don't even need to look. Good.

03:26:09.165 --> 03:26:13.638
TALIESIN: You both saw that, right? That just
fucking happened. This is not my normal die. This

03:26:13.638 --> 03:26:14.948
is something I bought at Comic Con.

03:26:14.948 --> 03:26:19.742
MATT: Oh, it's not the dice anymore. We know that
you've somehow gained the favor of some Aztec

03:26:19.742 --> 03:26:23.679
deity that's trying to reclaim its foothold in the
current-day pantheon through you.

03:26:23.679 --> 03:26:26.169
TALIESIN: Sumerian, you asshole.

03:26:26.169 --> 03:26:28.309
MATT: It would be Sumerian.

03:26:28.309 --> 03:26:31.822
TALIESIN: I'm bringing a shrine to Burning Man, by
the way.

03:26:31.822 --> 03:26:34.249
LAURA: Oh, this is pertaining to dragons!

03:26:34.249 --> 03:26:43.764
MATT: No, this is more of an icy terrain.
Nevertheless, between the two of you keeping an

03:26:43.764 --> 03:26:46.618
eye out, through this Marduk Enki-loving fool over
here--

03:26:46.618 --> 03:26:50.783
TALIESIN: Bless you for knowing a Sumerian deity.

03:26:50.783 --> 03:26:59.286
MATT: You look off and see that most of it, and
its design here is to be a sentry point. The

03:26:59.286 --> 03:27:05.171
reason it's built over the structure is it has a
view of the entirety of this central open valley

03:27:05.171 --> 03:27:12.194
in the ravine. There are nooks and crannies. There
are elements of ice that can be carved away. There

03:27:12.194 --> 03:27:18.403
are small alcoves that could be out of sight,
lower beyond the ice steps and such, but there is

03:27:18.403 --> 03:27:24.092
no extremely visible pockets or things that are
completely out of the visual sight from that

03:27:24.092 --> 03:27:28.841
perch. It was designed specifically to be a place
to survey everything.

03:27:28.841 --> 03:27:30.637
TALIESIN: Are there other perches?

03:27:30.637 --> 03:27:35.956
MATT: From what you can see here? There are
outcroppings of stone and elements that jut out

03:27:35.956 --> 03:27:39.982
naturally from the valley wall, but it's a wide
berth from each side.

03:27:39.982 --> 03:27:46.397
TALIESIN: Does this seem like the only thing, or
would there be other sentry points, as well?

03:27:46.397 --> 03:27:51.233
MATT: If flown to and held in, yeah. There are a
couple of other rock areas where the dragon would

03:27:51.233 --> 03:27:52.984
be able to hold himself, but this is
definitively--

03:27:52.984 --> 03:27:54.194
LIAM: Is this the highest?

03:27:54.194 --> 03:27:55.633
MATT: Which one?

03:27:55.633 --> 03:27:56.721
LIAM: The highest.

03:27:56.721 --> 03:27:59.706
TRAVIS: The highest point.

03:27:59.706 --> 03:28:01.938
TALIESIN: So we have a really good vantage right
now.

03:28:01.938 --> 03:28:04.892
MATT: From here, yeah. This is the highest point
in the ravine.

03:28:04.892 --> 03:28:08.853
TALIESIN: Do we see the orb? Do we see an orb?

03:28:08.853 --> 03:28:11.584
MATT: Make an investigation check.

03:28:11.584 --> 03:28:13.095
SAM: Can I help?

03:28:13.095 --> 03:28:14.762
LAURA: We're all looking.

03:28:14.762 --> 03:28:19.346
TALIESIN: There we go. See? That wasn't great.

03:28:19.346 --> 03:28:20.722
SAM: 28.

03:28:20.722 --> 03:28:22.058
TALIESIN: 11.

03:28:22.058 --> 03:28:24.670
LIAM: 17.

03:28:24.670 --> 03:28:26.001
LAURA: 16.

03:28:26.001 --> 03:28:27.143
TRAVIS: Nine!

03:28:27.143 --> 03:28:32.285
MATT: You guys take a while glancing about.
Nothing. Scanlan, you dart down and begin peering

03:28:32.285 --> 03:28:39.535
up against the ice walls that surround it. Going
down into the actual scooping bowl of this dragon

03:28:39.535 --> 03:28:45.459
nest, and looking down, you can see a little
glimmer of light that refracts at a different

03:28:45.459 --> 03:28:50.915
angle than the rest of the ice. A spherical
surface is visible about two and a half feet

03:28:50.915 --> 03:28:52.056
below.

03:28:52.056 --> 03:29:02.805
SAM: Okay. Do we smash it? Do we use it to make a
crank call? What do we do with it? Steal it?

03:29:02.805 --> 03:29:09.553
LAURA: They'll be able to scry on us for sure if
we steal it. They see us. The minute we looked

03:29:09.553 --> 03:29:11.702
into Brimscythe's.

03:29:11.702 --> 03:29:17.493
SAM: I could do a Vorugal voice and say: Thordak,
you're a cock!

03:29:17.493 --> 03:29:19.846
TALIESIN: We don't actually know his voice.

03:29:19.846 --> 03:29:27.505
SAM: I could say: Thordak, I'm in desperate need
of pay!

03:29:27.505 --> 03:29:29.491
LAURA: Do you speak dragon?

03:29:29.491 --> 03:29:36.759
SAM: I guess you'll have to do that. What do we
do? Do we break it so he can't communicate with

03:29:36.759 --> 03:29:39.438
the outside? That way when we kill him, he can't
call for help.

03:29:39.438 --> 03:29:43.100
TRAVIS: If we do, then we violate what we said we
were going to do.

03:29:43.100 --> 03:29:46.777
SAM: What did we say we would to do? I have a
great idea for how to kill this fucker.

03:29:46.777 --> 03:29:48.590
LAURA: You have a great idea of how to kill it?

03:29:48.590 --> 03:30:00.632
SAM: Well, I have an idea. Tooma told us that they
bring animals to hunt. We could be one of those

03:30:00.632 --> 03:30:03.564
animals and draw it to a certain spot.

03:30:03.564 --> 03:30:05.574
TALIESIN: And draw it to a certain spot?

03:30:05.574 --> 03:30:07.285
SAM: Where we kill it.

03:30:07.285 --> 03:30:08.760
TALIESIN: With our...

03:30:08.760 --> 03:30:14.907
SAM: With our army of fucking Draconians and our
ice thing that we've shaped into some sort of a trap.

03:30:14.907 --> 03:30:18.577
TALIESIN: I get a distinct impression that it is
not impressed by ice.

03:30:18.577 --> 03:30:22.751
SAM: Fire trap. Rock trap.

03:30:22.751 --> 03:30:27.124
MATT: And you're saying this out loud amongst the
crew, right?

03:30:27.124 --> 03:30:28.292
SAM: Just us.

03:30:28.292 --> 03:30:29.335
MATT: Okay.

03:30:29.335 --> 03:30:30.640
SAM: Oh shit.

03:30:30.640 --> 03:30:32.853
MARISHA: The ears have walls.

03:30:32.853 --> 03:30:36.860
LAURA: And also, you're right in front of the
scrying circle.

03:30:36.860 --> 03:30:39.194
LIAM: It's buried by ice.

03:30:39.194 --> 03:30:42.844
MARISHA: It's buried by ice, but that doesn't mean
it doesn't work.

03:30:42.844 --> 03:30:45.811
MATT: As soon as you called them Draconians, there
were a few hisses from the nearby crew.

03:30:45.811 --> 03:30:48.289
MARISHA: The Ravenites.

03:30:48.289 --> 03:30:50.189
TALIESIN: Do they speak Common?

03:30:50.189 --> 03:30:54.034
LIAM: Some of them do. We spoke to them in
Common.

03:30:54.034 --> 03:30:56.201
LAURA: We spoke to Tooma in Common.

03:30:56.201 --> 03:30:57.753
TALIESIN: Let's make a plan.

03:30:57.753 --> 03:31:02.345
SAM: I just did. I made a plan. It's an ambush
plan.

03:31:02.345 --> 03:31:05.180
TALIESIN: Okay, and then we go home and the
dragons are at war. Then what?

03:31:05.180 --> 03:31:08.584
SAM: What do you mean, the dragons are at war?
There's only two more dragons at that point. We

03:31:08.584 --> 03:31:09.813
killed three-fifths of them.

03:31:09.813 --> 03:31:15.296
LAURA: If we attack one dragon, we start the war.
That is something we've been told over and over.

03:31:15.296 --> 03:31:18.537
SAM: What does that even mean? We've already
attacked two dragons. There's been no war.

03:31:18.537 --> 03:31:22.323
LAURA: Once one more is dead, they'll probably all
attack.

03:31:22.323 --> 03:31:23.687
SAM: Attack what?

03:31:23.687 --> 03:31:29.340
LIAM: They'll stop playing nice. They'll start
destroying.

03:31:29.340 --> 03:31:31.665
SAM: We have to kill them at some point.

03:31:31.665 --> 03:31:33.719
TALIESIN: Yes, and now is not that point.

03:31:33.719 --> 03:31:39.535
LAURA: The greatest plan we have is what Grog came
up with, which is pitting them against each

03:31:39.535 --> 03:31:40.603
other.

03:31:40.603 --> 03:31:42.945
SAM: All right, so how do we use this orb to do
that right now?

03:31:42.945 --> 03:31:44.839
MARISHA: Do we have to use the orb?

03:31:44.839 --> 03:31:46.045
SAM: That's why we came here!

03:31:46.045 --> 03:31:50.061
LAURA: We came here to find out what its lair
looked like.

03:31:50.061 --> 03:31:55.139
TALIESIN: What we are going to need is we need to
sneak you in there, and we need you to take a

03:31:55.139 --> 03:31:56.738
movement.

03:31:56.738 --> 03:31:58.194
SAM: What does that mean?

03:31:58.194 --> 03:31:59.892
LIAM: A poo, Scanlan.

03:31:59.892 --> 03:32:01.948
SAM: I can't do it anymore.

03:32:01.948 --> 03:32:03.923
LAURA and LIAM: What?!

03:32:03.923 --> 03:32:10.062
SAM: I used my last magic poo to look at my
daughter.

03:32:10.062 --> 03:32:15.576
LIAM: What a sentence! What a sentence.

03:32:15.576 --> 03:32:19.055
LAURA: In every aspect, Scanlan, disgusting.

03:32:19.055 --> 03:32:20.778
MATT: That's the next t-shirt.

03:32:20.778 --> 03:32:25.596
TRAVIS: That's amazing. I used my last magic poo
to look at my daughter!

03:32:25.596 --> 03:32:31.638
SAM: I need to know where she is. I need to know
she's okay. Gilmore can maybe make me some more

03:32:31.638 --> 03:32:36.895
potion, but I haven't wanted to bother him about
it because he's busy keeping a shield around

03:32:36.895 --> 03:32:37.966
Whitestone.

03:32:37.966 --> 03:32:39.328
LAURA: Don't!

03:32:39.328 --> 03:32:40.197
SAM: Shit.

03:32:40.197 --> 03:32:42.431
LAURA: You didn't say that out loud. You did not
just say that out loud.

03:32:42.431 --> 03:32:43.806
SAM: I said it in an accent.

03:32:43.806 --> 03:32:45.762
MATT: That was out loud.

03:32:45.762 --> 03:32:48.442
MARISHA: All right. Hang on. Let's think about
this for a minute.

03:32:48.442 --> 03:32:53.004
LAURA: Can we just step away from the orb while we
talk?

03:32:53.004 --> 03:32:54.356
MARISHA: Yeah, let's do that.

03:32:54.356 --> 03:32:56.663
TALIESIN: We're not near the orb. We're near the
Draconians, aren't we?

03:32:56.663 --> 03:32:58.790
TRAVIS and MARISHA: Ravenites.

03:32:58.790 --> 03:33:04.103
MATT: They're still all gathered around the base.
They walked you here and they're basically

03:33:04.103 --> 03:33:08.996
watching you set up for this ambush preparation or
gathering. They're not going to leave you to your

03:33:08.996 --> 03:33:11.622
own devices. They're still not quite sure of
everything.

03:33:11.622 --> 03:33:15.843
LAURA: Can we sketch what it looks like? I think
you should sketch, Percy.

03:33:15.843 --> 03:33:20.941
SAM: We need to use this opportunity. We're never
going to be in this dragon's lair again! This is

03:33:20.941 --> 03:33:24.193
it. Crack the thing. Set a trap. Burn it down.

03:33:24.193 --> 03:33:25.792
TRAVIS: I have a suggestion.

03:33:25.792 --> 03:33:27.196
SAM: Yes, Grog, you're the best.

03:33:27.196 --> 03:33:34.733
TRAVIS: The white dragon is primal, right? He
likes to hunt creatures. We've got to go now. We

03:33:34.733 --> 03:33:39.699
leave. We leave them alone. That way we're not in
danger, they're not in danger. We promise to come

03:33:39.699 --> 03:33:45.826
back, not only with forces to help remove the
white dragon, but also with something for it to

03:33:45.826 --> 03:33:49.373
hunt. That way we're not fighting it in its
fucking lair.

03:33:49.373 --> 03:33:51.230
TALIESIN: We know a lot already.

03:33:51.230 --> 03:33:53.118
SAM: I can pretend to be a beast.

03:33:53.118 --> 03:33:57.982
TALIESIN: Scanlan, why would you bother to pretend
to be a beast? If he just finds you, he'll hunt

03:33:57.982 --> 03:33:59.233
you and kill you.

03:33:59.233 --> 03:34:02.695
TRAVIS: We know that there are people that will
work with us. We know what the terrain looks like.

03:34:02.695 --> 03:34:06.540
We know what his lair looks like, which we don't
want to be in when we fight him. And we know how

03:34:06.540 --> 03:34:09.806
to get him out of it, possibly. It's a pretty
successful trip.

03:34:09.806 --> 03:34:13.848
LIAM: One possibility is we could come back with
Galdric, and he and I could play bait.

03:34:13.848 --> 03:34:16.171
SAM: Galdric is the wolf, right?

03:34:16.171 --> 03:34:21.110
LIAM: He's a big fucking wolf.

03:34:21.110 --> 03:34:27.676
TALIESIN: We've made allies. We've got a look at
everything. We know the terrain, and we know the

03:34:27.676 --> 03:34:29.079
political terrain.

03:34:29.079 --> 03:34:32.115
LAURA: Maybe Urukat would want to come and fight a
dragon.

03:34:32.115 --> 03:34:33.569
MARISHA: He might.

03:34:33.569 --> 03:34:38.300
TALIESIN: I will also add that we can leave them
with something.

03:34:38.300 --> 03:34:42.434
MARISHA: That's what I was thinking. Maybe this
isn't about destroying something. Maybe it's about

03:34:42.434 --> 03:34:50.303
planting something. If we destroy anything, the
dragon's going to immediately blame the locals.

03:34:50.303 --> 03:34:53.359
LAURA: What would we leave? I don't want them able
to scry on us.

03:34:53.359 --> 03:34:54.841
TRAVIS: How about a little wine?

03:34:54.841 --> 03:34:56.893
TALIESIN: How about a small grove of trees?

03:34:56.893 --> 03:34:59.825
MARISHA: I could leave trees.

03:34:59.825 --> 03:35:01.458
TRAVIS: They did want trees.

03:35:01.458 --> 03:35:04.082
LAURA: I could leave trees, too.

03:35:04.082 --> 03:35:12.207
MARISHA: We also have this Scrying Eye. Can I use
this remotely?

03:35:12.207 --> 03:35:15.179
MATT: No, you have to have it in your hands to
utilize it.

03:35:15.179 --> 03:35:17.683
TALIESIN: It's all right.

03:35:17.683 --> 03:35:19.376
TRAVIS: I like the tree idea.

03:35:19.376 --> 03:35:31.657
LAURA: Tooma, just in case something happens and a
big red dragon comes to pick a fight, everyone

03:35:31.657 --> 03:35:33.946
hide. Get out of the way.

03:35:33.946 --> 03:35:40.212
MATT: "I appreciate the advice. I can guarantee
you there would be no other course of action."

03:35:40.212 --> 03:35:45.354
SAM: Can we carve in the lair "Thordak was here"
or something?

03:35:45.354 --> 03:35:48.231
LIAM: They'll know it was you.

03:35:48.231 --> 03:35:50.968
LAURA: I think we got the information--

03:35:50.968 --> 03:35:58.105
TRAVIS: Tooma. Forgive me, I'm not the best
speaker, but we have learned from fighting these

03:35:58.105 --> 03:36:04.053
dragons that if we fight them in their lair, we
are at a severe disadvantage.

03:36:04.053 --> 03:36:07.045
MATT: "Then get it from its lair."

03:36:07.045 --> 03:36:09.385
TRAVIS: We are of a mind on that.

03:36:09.385 --> 03:36:11.902
LAURA: What kind of creatures do you offer to it
for hunt?

03:36:11.902 --> 03:36:20.867
MATT: "It is growing bored with dire beasts. We've
even brought it to the ocean, where there were

03:36:20.867 --> 03:36:35.247
"some great terrors beneath the sea, but it tore
them asunder. There are, northward, large

03:36:35.247 --> 03:36:47.690
"segmented insect-like creatures they call the
remorhaz. That was a scuffle, but I fear the

03:36:47.690 --> 03:36:49.512
"dragon grows bored."

03:36:49.512 --> 03:36:53.377
SAM: Got to go find us a beast and bring it here.

03:36:53.377 --> 03:36:55.692
TALIESIN: No, I've got a better idea.

03:36:55.692 --> 03:36:57.929
LIAM: Spit it out.

03:36:57.929 --> 03:37:09.998
TALIESIN: Once we've gathered some resources, when
we return, we prepare to attack post-hunt. Once it

03:37:09.998 --> 03:37:15.824
has exhausted itself on something large and angry,
that is when we strike the dragon.

03:37:15.824 --> 03:37:19.718
LAURA: How will we be able to communicate with
them, for them to let us know?

03:37:19.718 --> 03:37:21.677
SAM: We'll be here the whole time.

03:37:21.677 --> 03:37:28.994
TALIESIN: When we come back, we stay until it's
time. When we come back, it is to end this.

03:37:28.994 --> 03:37:31.926
LIAM: For now, we leave a back-door entrance.

03:37:31.926 --> 03:37:37.519
TALIESIN: With the trees, we will know how to
return quickly with a force.

03:37:37.519 --> 03:37:43.083
MARISHA: This might be something we go to the
Slayer's Take for. They always have a roster of

03:37:43.083 --> 03:37:44.415
big beasts.

03:37:44.415 --> 03:37:52.245
TALIESIN: With a little bit of information, we
could even keep them informed of things for it to

03:37:52.245 --> 03:37:58.941
kill that they may find around here, with the
Slayer's Take's help. We can keep you in supply of

03:37:58.941 --> 03:38:01.077
things to amuse it.

03:38:01.077 --> 03:38:07.193
MATT: "I trust you know what you say. These words
mean nothing to me."

03:38:07.193 --> 03:38:16.198
TALIESIN: We are sorry that this cannot end as
quickly as would be agreeable. We can do our best

03:38:16.198 --> 03:38:28.468
to help make you comfortable, and if you need some
proof of the power that we wield, we can offer a

03:38:28.468 --> 03:38:41.459
token. I have a thought. But if you wish, a token
of our power.

03:38:41.459 --> 03:38:55.369
MATT: "How about this. I trust you to return.
Let's set a time, so we know where the limits are.

03:38:55.369 --> 03:38:59.488
"Eight days."

03:38:59.488 --> 03:39:02.737
MARISHA: Wow. That's soon.

03:39:02.737 --> 03:39:12.753
TALIESIN: We can send a beast before, perhaps, but
our travel is long. We may need more time. We have

03:39:12.753 --> 03:39:14.498
two more continents.

03:39:14.498 --> 03:39:16.581
MATT: "How much time do you need?"

03:39:16.581 --> 03:39:20.369
LAURA and TALIESIN: Two weeks.

03:39:20.369 --> 03:39:22.387
MATT: "Two weeks?"

03:39:22.387 --> 03:39:29.723
TALIESIN: Continents. Further than you have walked
in your life. We move quickly, but there is only

03:39:29.723 --> 03:39:31.982
so much that can be done.

03:39:31.982 --> 03:39:44.636
MATT: "Two weeks. 14 sun cycles past. If we do not
hear from you, the Frigid Doom is known to this

03:39:44.636 --> 03:39:46.613
"Whitestone you speak."

03:39:46.613 --> 03:39:48.672
LAURA: Fucking shit balls, Scanlan.

03:39:48.672 --> 03:39:50.587
LIAM: They're extorting us.

03:39:50.587 --> 03:39:58.078
MATT: "Not extorting. Making sure you are of your
word, because otherwise you leave us here to die

03:39:58.078 --> 03:40:00.556
"on promises that are fake and false."

03:40:00.556 --> 03:40:02.730
LIAM: To-may-to, to-mah-to.

03:40:02.730 --> 03:40:04.562
LAURA: We don't do that.

03:40:04.562 --> 03:40:07.309
MATT: "Good. Then we'll see you before two weeks
is out."

03:40:07.309 --> 03:40:10.178
LAURA: Yep.

03:40:10.178 --> 03:40:20.739
MARISHA: I will leave you with a parting gift. I
will leave you with a grove of trees that should

03:40:20.739 --> 03:40:22.370
be ever-growing and present.

03:40:22.370 --> 03:40:26.808
LAURA: If you do that, he'll know something is
different.

03:40:26.808 --> 03:40:27.885
MARISHA: He will.

03:40:27.885 --> 03:40:31.935
TALIESIN: No. We plant one tree.

03:40:31.935 --> 03:40:33.839
MARISHA: One?

03:40:33.839 --> 03:40:39.357
TALIESIN: No, we have to plant some trees. Find a
place that is secret.

03:40:39.357 --> 03:40:44.870
MARISHA: I can plant these trees anywhere. Just
need solid ground.

03:40:44.870 --> 03:40:46.863
TRAVIS: If you can get away from the city--

03:40:46.863 --> 03:40:48.607
MARISHA: I can possibly do it subterranean.

03:40:48.607 --> 03:40:53.993
MATT: "There is solid ground here. Up there, above
the ravine, wherever else you need it to be."

03:40:53.993 --> 03:41:01.285
MARISHA: Where does the dragon not tread? Where do
you know he will not see the trees?

03:41:01.285 --> 03:41:07.307
MATT: "Probably out of the ravine. He stalks
inside quite extensively."

03:41:07.307 --> 03:41:12.085
TALIESIN: Let's find a place. This will be where
we leave, anyway.

03:41:12.085 --> 03:41:23.732
SAM: Tooma. I have one more question about Gern
Blanston. I raise the hand cone, and I cast

03:41:23.732 --> 03:41:27.681
Modify Memory on her.

03:41:27.681 --> 03:41:40.916
TRAVIS: Oh no. Oh jeez. Oh man, I love it.

03:41:40.916 --> 03:41:43.400
LIAM: Look at Matt's face.

03:41:43.400 --> 03:41:46.101
MATT: Okay.

03:41:46.101 --> 03:41:48.515
LAURA: We're about to get attacked.

03:41:48.515 --> 03:41:51.344
TALIESIN: No, we're about to run.

03:41:51.344 --> 03:41:53.004
LIAM: Can I roll my initiative in advance?

03:41:53.004 --> 03:41:58.823
MATT: There we go. All right, what's the DC?

03:41:58.823 --> 03:42:01.099
SAM: 21.

03:42:01.099 --> 03:42:04.881
MATT: What are you trying to do?

03:42:04.881 --> 03:42:13.340
SAM: I'm trying to change the moment that I said
"Whitestone" into "Emon."

03:42:13.340 --> 03:42:27.028
MATT: You watch as she leans in, and she shakes
her head for a minute and goes, "What was your

03:42:27.028 --> 03:42:30.326
"question? I do not know these words you speak."

03:42:30.326 --> 03:42:32.935
SAM: Candles. Have you ever met a candle-maker?

03:42:32.935 --> 03:42:34.431
MATT: "I know not of a candle-maker."

03:42:34.431 --> 03:42:38.442
TALIESIN: I do have a request on our way out.

03:42:38.442 --> 03:42:39.802
MATT: "What is your request?"

03:42:39.802 --> 03:42:48.603
TALIESIN: Would the dragon notice if any of these
bodies were disturbed?

03:42:48.603 --> 03:43:02.308
MATT: "Many, yes. But small amounts... why? If you
wish to take what they have, they mean nothing to

03:43:02.308 --> 03:43:05.836
"us. One or two turned over will make no difference
to the dragon."

03:43:05.836 --> 03:43:10.614
TALIESIN: Pull that one down, then.

03:43:10.614 --> 03:43:21.709
MATT: "Right." She points to it. Some of the
Ravenites come over and haul one of the corpses

03:43:21.709 --> 03:43:27.197
off of the spike. It breaks off and snaps, and
they bring it and throw it to the ground and step back.

03:43:27.197 --> 03:43:43.298
TALIESIN: Thank you. (sighs) It is exactly what I
expect, I would assume.

03:43:43.298 --> 03:43:47.128
MATT: The robes are familiar. The scale color is
familiar.

03:43:47.128 --> 03:43:51.948
TALIESIN: I look it over. I check.

03:43:51.948 --> 03:44:08.052
MATT: There, locked in the moments of valiant
defense of his city, frozen and lost, the remains

03:44:08.052 --> 03:44:20.904
of Tiberius Stormwind, left a hero defending his
people, defaced by Vorugal the Frigid Doom.

03:44:30.059 --> 03:44:33.121
TALIESIN: Let's bring him inside, at least.

03:44:33.121 --> 03:44:49.513
TRAVIS: Yeah. I go and I gather the remains.

03:44:49.513 --> 03:44:53.852
MATT: They are stiff and frozen, but light enough
for you to carry.

03:44:53.852 --> 03:45:02.231
LIAM: Where are we taking him?

03:45:02.231 --> 03:45:10.135
TALIESIN: I don't know. The remnants of the
library, perhaps. The ground's too hard to bury.

03:45:10.135 --> 03:45:18.326
MARISHA: We can't even pretend like he was our
friend.

03:45:18.326 --> 03:45:22.568
TALIESIN: No. We absolutely cannot.

03:45:22.568 --> 03:45:39.597
TRAVIS: I have a horrible thought. If we move him,
will the dragon know we were here?

03:45:39.597 --> 03:45:42.202
SAM: Was he on one of those stakes?

03:45:42.202 --> 03:45:49.973
TALIESIN: He was. No, I checked. Unless he's very
clever and very keen, and I don't think they are.

03:45:49.973 --> 03:46:03.775
I think that if they knew, he would be in a more
exalted position of defacement. I think this is

03:46:03.775 --> 03:46:16.129
just slaughter. Things vanish. I'm all right with
making this vanish. That's as much of a calling

03:46:16.129 --> 03:46:18.438
card as I feel we need to leave.

03:46:18.438 --> 03:46:20.775
TRAVIS: Where should we bring him?

03:46:20.775 --> 03:46:23.759
SAM: His home doesn't really exist anymore.

03:46:23.759 --> 03:46:26.792
MARISHA: His home was with us.

03:46:26.792 --> 03:46:28.685
LAURA: Back to Emon.

03:46:28.685 --> 03:46:30.349
TALIESIN: I have a thought.

03:46:30.349 --> 03:46:35.802
LIAM: To our keep. It was very important to him.

03:46:35.802 --> 03:46:37.927
SAM: This is his place.

03:46:37.927 --> 03:46:42.232
TALIESIN: We're not bringing him to us. We're
leaving him here, but we're putting him somewhere

03:46:42.232 --> 03:46:43.731
appropriate.

03:46:43.731 --> 03:46:50.121
LIAM: We'd take him away. Can you melt ice and
snow, and we'll lay him here?

03:46:50.121 --> 03:46:52.263
TALIESIN: Put him with the books.

03:46:52.263 --> 03:46:54.213
LAURA: He always loved them.

03:46:54.213 --> 03:47:05.219
SAM: For now, anyway. And then when we free this
place, we can find a proper tomb for him.

03:47:05.219 --> 03:47:12.087
TRAVIS: We take him back to where the frozen books
lay.

03:47:12.087 --> 03:47:20.000
MATT: You find the remnants of the library. As you
find a section of the stone rubble that's loose

03:47:20.000 --> 03:47:25.234
enough, you pull it open, and there beneath, you
can see there are hundreds and hundreds of books,

03:47:25.234 --> 03:47:34.282
many still pristine, if a little soggy from the
melted snow. You gather a lot of time was spent in

03:47:34.282 --> 03:47:41.425
this library in his youth, and it's probably as
good a place as any to leave his memory for the time.

03:47:41.425 --> 03:47:44.991
LAURA: Are any of the Ravenites around us, or are
we alone?

03:47:44.991 --> 03:47:56.543
MATT: They're keeping their distance, but they're
watching. You get the sense that they understand

03:47:56.543 --> 03:48:02.834
what's going on, but they're not taking any
offense to it.

03:48:02.834 --> 03:48:07.744
TALIESIN: This will do.

03:48:07.744 --> 03:48:10.427
LIAM: I start pulling books out.

03:48:10.427 --> 03:48:12.653
MARISHA: I start melting ice.

03:48:12.653 --> 03:48:18.279
LAURA: Is Lockheed still on my shoulder?

03:48:18.279 --> 03:48:20.699
MATT: Lockheed is still on your shoulder.

03:48:20.699 --> 03:48:24.544
LAURA: I bring him down so he can say goodbye.

03:48:24.544 --> 03:48:36.568
MATT: As the ice melts, color comes to the body.
You can see the tattered robes that show a fierce

03:48:36.568 --> 03:48:51.152
battle was fought. Regardless of this condition of
finding him, knowing him as well as you did, he

03:48:51.152 --> 03:49:02.539
still probably left a hero. As you lay him down on
the books, mostly thawed now, Lockheed finds a

03:49:02.539 --> 03:49:11.516
moment of recognition and immediately flutters
onto his chest and curls up, mews a bit, nibbles

03:49:11.516 --> 03:49:13.737
at the chin.

03:49:13.737 --> 03:49:28.703
LIAM: I'm going to sit three or four feet away
from him, facing him, and start privately thanking

03:49:28.703 --> 03:49:34.689
the Raven Queen for ushering him on.

03:49:34.689 --> 03:49:45.134
TRAVIS: I'm going to take a chalice out of the bag
of holding, and I begin to fill it with ale, and

03:49:45.134 --> 03:49:53.544
then remember he preferred water, and I take the
alchemy jug and I pour fresh water into the

03:49:53.544 --> 03:49:55.782
chalice and lay it with him.

03:49:55.782 --> 03:50:01.673
MARISHA: I take and I rip off a piece of his
robes. Tuck it away.

03:50:01.673 --> 03:50:04.628
TALIESIN: Can you seal it?

03:50:04.628 --> 03:50:14.426
MATT: As you guys step back, the nearby stone
clatters to life.

03:50:14.426 --> 03:50:20.638
LAURA: I get Lockheed out of there. I don't want
him to stay in. Do you want to come?

03:50:20.638 --> 03:50:23.673
MATT: Lockheed resists and resists and doesn't
want to leave.

03:50:23.673 --> 03:50:27.967
LAURA: In Draconic I say: It's all right.

03:50:27.967 --> 03:50:37.903
MATT: Lockheed curls up onto his face and nibbles
a bit on the forehead, then turns back and

03:50:37.903 --> 03:50:46.242
flutters up onto your shoulder. The stonework
clatters closed over the top of the rubble of the

03:50:46.242 --> 03:50:47.738
library.

03:50:47.738 --> 03:50:52.270
MARISHA: Keyleth drops to her knees and starts
crying.

03:50:52.270 --> 03:51:07.475
MATT: Vax. In this moment of sadness, there is a
bit of warmth, as you sense, though remote as it

03:51:07.475 --> 03:51:15.633
is through the Divine Gate, the Raven Queen's
assurance that his spirit has made it to the other side.

03:51:15.633 --> 03:51:27.521
LAURA: I put my hand on Keyleth's shoulder. He
loved you well, princess.

03:51:27.521 --> 03:51:33.591
MARISHA: He was so stupid.

03:51:33.591 --> 03:51:42.144
LIAM: He meant well.

03:51:42.144 --> 03:51:44.723
TALIESIN: I'm going to find Tooma. Is she behind
us?

03:51:44.723 --> 03:51:47.182
MARISHA: He should have never left our side.

03:51:47.182 --> 03:52:00.506
TALIESIN: Hopefully, this war will go on schedule.
But there's our promise. That's the best you're

03:52:00.506 --> 03:52:04.691
going to get. I head out.

03:52:04.691 --> 03:52:09.430
MARISHA: I follow Percy.

03:52:09.430 --> 03:52:21.087
SAM: I turn around and say: Goodbye, old friend.
We'll come back and we'll fix this. Because this

03:52:21.087 --> 03:52:33.679
is... poppycock.

03:52:33.679 --> 03:52:45.176
MATT: As you gather yourselves up, here amongst
the ruins of Draconia, the last of the sky's

03:52:45.176 --> 03:52:53.542
light, the sun has faded and the night has taken
its form. You hear the distant caws of the evening

03:52:53.542 --> 03:53:00.843
birds as they begin to take to the skies above the
ravine. Tooma and the rest of the Ravenites give a

03:53:00.843 --> 03:53:06.932
nod as you join hands. Keyleth?

03:53:06.932 --> 03:53:08.887
MARISHA: Let's go home.

03:53:08.887 --> 03:53:12.696
TALIESIN: Yes, let's. There's much to do.

03:53:12.696 --> 03:53:15.041
MARISHA: Back to Whitestone.

03:53:15.041 --> 03:53:21.475
LAURA: Were you going to leave a tree?

03:53:21.475 --> 03:53:24.444
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:53:24.444 --> 03:53:30.434
TALIESIN: We let them know where the grove would
be found, before we left them.

03:53:30.434 --> 03:53:36.823
MARISHA: I do Plant Growth. Make a big old tree.

03:53:36.823 --> 03:53:44.322
MATT: All righty. Where do you create the tree?

03:53:44.322 --> 03:53:48.267
MARISHA: Wherever we decided it was best to create
the tree.

03:53:48.267 --> 03:53:49.912
LAURA: Outside of the ravine.

03:53:49.912 --> 03:53:52.825
TALIESIN: At the top. A little grove of trees.

03:53:52.825 --> 03:54:00.564
MATT: Which, with a simple use of the broom or
wild shape, you can make your way up there, find a

03:54:00.564 --> 03:54:05.327
small patch of bushes, create a single tree that
didn't exist there previously, a small sapling now

03:54:05.327 --> 03:54:20.321
grown to full height. The bastion of a promise to
be kept. Keyleth returns. You take hands. You step

03:54:20.321 --> 03:54:24.987
through the nearest tree as the portal opens, and
find yourself emerging from the other side of the

03:54:24.987 --> 03:54:26.764
Sun Tree, back in Whitestone.

03:54:26.764 --> 03:54:30.785
MARISHA: I give the Sun Tree a little pat.

03:54:30.785 --> 03:54:39.367
MATT: The morning sun begins to rise.

03:54:39.367 --> 03:54:48.926
TALIESIN: We'll report what we've seen. We'll try
to gain our bearings again, get sleep tonight.

03:54:48.926 --> 03:55:01.753
We'll report what we've seen in the new room. No
one else. And we will never utter this city's name

03:55:01.753 --> 03:55:03.614
outside these walls again.

03:55:03.614 --> 03:55:08.230
SAM: Totally. Dick move.

03:55:08.230 --> 03:55:16.217
MATT: You find yourselves to rest, keeping
memories fresh untill sleep takes you.

03:55:16.217 --> 03:55:23.192
MARISHA: Knock on Vax's door.

03:55:23.192 --> 03:55:25.425
SAM: Oh god.

03:55:25.425 --> 03:55:31.987
MATT: All right. As everyone else is going to
rest, Keyleth, you find your way to Vax's door.

03:55:31.987 --> 03:55:36.170
MARISHA: Can I stay with you tonight?

03:55:36.170 --> 03:55:44.032
LIAM: I don't fuck anything up with words, and I
open the door.

03:55:44.032 --> 03:55:45.543
SAM: What?

03:55:45.543 --> 03:55:51.397
LIAM: I'm not going to fuck it up by saying
anything. I open the door.

03:55:51.397 --> 03:55:53.829
MARISHA: I just go in.

03:55:53.829 --> 03:56:02.876
MATT: Whether or not you are taking the time to
sleep or ruminate on the events, as it's only been

03:56:02.876 --> 03:56:11.651
half a day since last you woke up, you take some
time with Lockheed. He eats a little more food and

03:56:11.651 --> 03:56:18.587
leaps to the window of your room, and then takes
off over the rest of Whitestone.

03:56:18.587 --> 03:56:30.833
You process this time, this moment, this memory,
and realize how much has been lost through this

03:56:30.833 --> 03:56:40.334
journey, but yet how much is worth saving. How
much is worth fighting for. And then, as much as

03:56:40.334 --> 03:56:48.540
you bunch of fuck-up misfits that came together as
friends years ago have come to a point of

03:56:48.540 --> 03:56:52.371
understanding your true worth and what the
importance is of really standing up for the things

03:56:52.371 --> 03:56:59.937
that you believe in in this world, and the people
that need protecting, and know that the next step

03:56:59.937 --> 03:57:05.739
of your journey should come soon. Whether you
stand or fall, this is the fight that needs to be

03:57:05.739 --> 03:57:14.682
fought. And with luck be at your side, that
terrible fucking dragon will meet its end soon

03:57:14.682 --> 03:57:18.181
enough.

03:57:18.181 --> 03:57:21.199
And with that we'll pick up next week on
Thursday.

03:57:21.199 --> 03:57:24.955
TALIESIN: Glad we decided to take a light-hearted
game.

03:57:24.955 --> 03:57:28.062
SAM: It's a fun romp after the Feywild, a fun
romp.

03:57:28.062 --> 03:57:30.563
LIAM: Bar hop! Bar crawl!

03:57:30.563 --> 03:57:40.537
MARISHA: I need a stiff drink.

03:57:40.537 --> 03:57:45.281
MATT: I was simultaneously looking forward to and
not looking forward to the return to Draconia for

03:57:45.281 --> 03:57:46.832
that reason.

03:57:46.832 --> 03:57:49.695
LAURA: Man.

03:57:49.695 --> 03:57:52.162
MATT: We'll pick it up next week, guys.

03:57:52.162 --> 03:57:54.675
MARISHA: Yay.

03:57:54.675 --> 03:58:01.163
MATT: I'm sorry. Sorry, guys. Sorry to you.

03:58:01.163 --> 03:58:03.035
LAURA: Thanks, Loot Crate.

03:58:03.035 --> 03:58:09.753
SAM: $3 discount.

03:58:09.753 --> 03:58:13.935
TRAVIS: Pour one out for Tibs. We will be.

03:58:13.935 --> 03:58:20.343
MATT: Not all narrative is bright, but it has its
purpose.

03:58:20.343 --> 03:58:22.082
SAM: We're next.

03:58:22.082 --> 03:58:26.226
(laughter)

03:58:26.226 --> 03:58:29.871
MATT: We love you guys. Thank you for sticking
through us for an emotionally draining evening.

03:58:29.871 --> 03:58:37.240
We'll be back next Thursday to see the next length
of Vox Machina's journey. Is it Thursday yet? Good night.
