00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.065
MATT: Hello, everyone, and welcome to tonight's
episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us

00:00:03.065 --> 00:00:07.083
nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play
Dungeons and Dragons, or are a little late on the

00:00:07.083 --> 00:00:12.853
draw when shouting the phrase out, Travis
Willingham. (laughs) Anyway, before we get into

00:00:12.853 --> 00:00:19.190
tonight's episode, let's go ahead and jump into
our announcements. Let's see here, we've got a new

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:21.299
game called Injustice 2 that just came out.

00:00:21.299 --> 00:00:22.764
TRAVIS and ASHLEY: Yeah!

00:00:22.764 --> 00:00:25.846
LAURA: Wait a minute. What is this Injustice 2 you
speak of?

00:00:25.846 --> 00:00:31.076
TRAVIS: Is that the shapes and pie-making game
that you play in the kitchen bakery?

00:00:31.076 --> 00:00:32.557
MARISHA: It's like Cooking Mama.

00:00:32.557 --> 00:00:37.128
LAURA: I watched a video today of you and you
fighting, which was pretty exciting.

00:00:37.128 --> 00:00:39.098
MATT: Yeah, we have all the Flashes covered, I
think.

00:00:39.098 --> 00:00:41.569
TALIESIN: All of the Flashes are on this show.

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:43.165
LAURA: That's crazy.

00:00:43.165 --> 00:00:44.227
MATT: So who do you guys play?

00:00:44.227 --> 00:00:45.681
TALIESIN: I play Barry Allen.

00:00:45.681 --> 00:00:47.808
LIAM: I play Reverse-Flash. What's his name?

00:00:47.808 --> 00:00:49.584
TALIESIN: Eobard Thawne.

00:00:49.584 --> 00:00:50.798
LIAM: Right.

00:00:50.798 --> 00:00:52.194
LAURA: I play Supergirl!

00:00:52.235 --> 00:00:55.538
TRAVIS: I play Tim Garrick.

00:00:55.538 --> 00:00:57.274
TALIESIN: Jay Garrick.

00:00:57.274 --> 00:01:02.266
TRAVIS: Jay Garrick. I wear a tin pail for a
helmet.

00:01:02.266 --> 00:01:03.788
MATT: It's pretty slick.

00:01:03.788 --> 00:01:08.640
TRAVIS: The one Flash I don't know, really.

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.932
MATT: Next Halloween, man. Just saying. I'd love a
picture of you wearing that hat.

00:01:13.932 --> 00:01:15.411
TALIESIN: Oh my god!

00:01:15.411 --> 00:01:16.619
ASHLEY: Yes, please.

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:22.219
MATT: Please. It'll be great. And I play Deadshot.
Yeah, check it out, it looks really good. They had

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:25.148
us all do really intense facial motion capture
which is even funnier, considering that my

00:01:25.148 --> 00:01:27.493
character wears a mask the whole time.

00:01:27.493 --> 00:01:29.028
TRAVIS: Did they really make you do that?

00:01:29.028 --> 00:01:30.092
MATT and TALIESIN: Yeah.

00:01:30.092 --> 00:01:31.212
TRAVIS: With a mask?

00:01:31.212 --> 00:01:32.789
MATT: Well, not with a mask on my face, but yeah.

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:34.470
TALIESIN: That would've been even better.

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.253
MATT: I assume there'll be a DLC costume where he
doesn't have a mask, or they just did it to fuck

00:01:39.253 --> 00:01:41.886
with me, which I respect either way.

00:01:41.886 --> 00:01:44.830
TRAVIS: They're in the booth, going (whispers)
we're not getting any of this!

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:48.129
TALIESIN: Don't tell him! Let it roll.

00:01:48.129 --> 00:01:51.671
TRAVIS: Just draw a dick-butt on his forehead;
it's fine.

00:01:51.671 --> 00:01:54.629
LAURA: Those bright lights are headache-inducing,
yeah.

00:01:54.683 --> 00:02:01.360
MATT: So check it out. It's out now, it's fun!
What I've seen of it looks actually really cool.

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.226
TALIESIN: I've played a little; it's fun.

00:02:03.226 --> 00:02:08.035
MATT: They got their RPG in my fighting game,
and that's right up my alley. All right, also,

00:02:08.094 --> 00:02:15.730
because it's coming up real fast, reminder,
MomoCon, May 25th to the 28th. MoMocon! Taliesin,

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:20.162
Marisha, myself, and Brian W. Foster are going to
be there for a Talks Machina panel, as well as

00:02:20.162 --> 00:02:22.888
other events throughout the weekend, so look
forward to seeing you there in Atlanta, Georgia,

00:02:22.888 --> 00:02:28.691
weekend after this one. Also, I will be at A-Kon
once again, June 8th to the 11th in Fort Worth,

00:02:28.691 --> 00:02:35.507
Texas. Come say hello to me there. And then,
remember that Talks Machina is live on Tuesdays at

00:02:35.507 --> 00:02:42.451
7PM Pacific Time here on Twitch and Alpha. The
submission email has changed, so to submit your

00:02:42.451 --> 00:02:50.893
gif and/or fanart of the week, use
submit@talksmachina.com. So that is submit,

00:02:50.893 --> 00:02:59.044
submit! One submit, not two, that's just my
psychosis. Submit@talksmachina.com. Yes. Anything

00:02:59.044 --> 00:03:02.769
else anyone wants to talk about, are we good? Move
on to the game for the night.

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:11.179
LAURA: Oh! Farpoint came out. So if you have
PlayStation Virtual Reality System, then you can

00:03:11.179 --> 00:03:15.387
get Farpoint, and I play Dr. Eva Tyson on it, and
it's actually a really freaking cool game.

00:03:15.387 --> 00:03:18.576
TRAVIS: It's fun, you shoot things with a gun. Do
you have to get the gun for it?

00:03:18.576 --> 00:03:21.191
LAURA: You shoot things with a gun, and it was a
really cool script and stuff.

00:03:21.191 --> 00:03:23.213
I liked the story a lot.

00:03:23.213 --> 00:03:24.965
LIAM: That's not how guns work.

00:03:24.965 --> 00:03:26.784
TALIESIN and MARISHA: Are we talking about next
week?

00:03:26.784 --> 00:03:28.133
MATT: Oh, yeah, we should say that, too.

00:03:28.133 --> 00:03:29.291
MARISHA: That's a big one.

00:03:29.291 --> 00:03:34.102
MATT: That wasn't on the list. So yeah. So we're
missing two cast members next week.

00:03:34.102 --> 00:03:37.164
TRAVIS: Guess who's not here.

00:03:37.164 --> 00:03:42.129
MATT: What? That's terrible.

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:44.922
ASHLEY: Hey!

00:03:44.922 --> 00:03:49.687
MATT: But given the circumstance, instead, we're
going to have a non-numbered episode next week,

00:03:49.687 --> 00:03:54.220
instead it looks like we're going to throw in for
a new, higher-level battle royale for those who

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:58.406
will be here to see how some of these high-level
abilities function.

00:03:58.406 --> 00:04:02.980
MARISHA: You won't be there to put my face in lava
this time! I'll just have myself to do that.

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:05.142
ASHLEY: I know, you guys, I won't be there, so.

00:04:05.142 --> 00:04:07.259
TRAVIS: Will Friedle won the first one, she won
the last one.

00:04:07.259 --> 00:04:08.456
LAURA: I've never done it.

00:04:08.456 --> 00:04:09.715
SAM: I've never done it, either.

00:04:09.715 --> 00:04:11.614
LAURA: Oh no. And you're doing it as Tary?

00:04:11.614 --> 00:04:13.431
MATT: It's up to you; you get to choose.

00:04:13.431 --> 00:04:16.108
MARISHA: Are you going to bring back Scanlan?

00:04:16.108 --> 00:04:20.384
SAM: All right, Taryon's going to die in like five
seconds.

00:04:20.384 --> 00:04:22.168
(laughter)

00:04:22.168 --> 00:04:25.083
TALIESIN: So if we loot Tary's body, do we get all
of his stuff?

00:04:25.083 --> 00:04:26.039
MATT: It's not in canon.

00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:27.516
TALIESIN: No, even not in canon, in the game.

00:04:27.516 --> 00:04:30.509
MATT: Oh, if you go to his body after he's dead,
you can grab any of his shit to use it.

00:04:30.509 --> 00:04:32.809
TALIESIN: You are a loot drop, oh my god.

00:04:32.809 --> 00:04:35.410
MATT: As long as it's not attunement, you can use
it.

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:37.996
LAURA: Is the helmet attuned? It is, isn't it?

00:04:37.996 --> 00:04:39.230
MATT: I believe it is, yes.

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:40.273
SAM: Probably, yeah.

00:04:40.273 --> 00:04:42.602
LAURA: Too bad. But we can just steal all of his
jewels just for the sake of it.

00:04:42.602 --> 00:04:44.861
MATT: There you go. In the alternate universe
version, you are just decked out.

00:04:44.861 --> 00:04:46.434
SAM: Do I get Doty in the fight?

00:04:46.434 --> 00:04:47.234
MATT: Yeah.

00:04:47.234 --> 00:04:48.630
SAM: Okay. That helps.

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:49.942
MATT: And you'll be leveled up to their level.

00:04:49.942 --> 00:04:51.974
SAM: And I'll be leveled up to their level?

00:04:51.974 --> 00:04:53.218
MATT: For the battle royale, yeah.

00:04:53.218 --> 00:04:54.948
TALIESIN: Yeah, we level up for that.

00:04:54.948 --> 00:05:01.569
MATT: Anyway, that'll be next week. That pushes
our hundredth episode to June 8th. And it looks

00:05:01.569 --> 00:05:04.464
like we're confirmed for June 1st for our next
guest, I believe.

00:05:04.464 --> 00:05:09.583
SAM: Yes. Yes, we are. We are confirmed for that.
Are we announcing that?

00:05:09.583 --> 00:05:11.022
MATT: Yeah, sure. Yeah.

00:05:11.022 --> 00:05:16.922
SAM: Oh, well, yeah, on June 1st, our next guest,
Jon Heder AKA Napoleon Dynamite, is going to come

00:05:16.922 --> 00:05:22.041
play with us and roll some dice. Yeah.

00:05:22.041 --> 00:05:24.330
MARISHA: My mother has never been so proud of me.

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:28.274
LAURA: So, did we already say that because next
week is a battle royale,

00:05:28.274 --> 00:05:29.707
that means our hundredth episode--

00:05:29.707 --> 00:05:30.748
MATT: Is pushed to the 8th, yes.

00:05:30.748 --> 00:05:32.697
LAURA: Okay, you already said that? Was I busy
rolling dice and talking?

00:05:32.697 --> 00:05:40.504
MATT: You were. But thank you, Laura. Good looking
out. I appreciate that. So yeah, I think that's

00:05:40.504 --> 00:05:44.850
all the major news, and given that, let's go ahead
and dive in to

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:48.163
tonight's episode of Critical Role.

00:05:48.163 --> 00:07:16.291
[dramatic music]

00:07:16.354 --> 00:07:26.944
MATT: Hello and welcome back, everybody. So last
time where we left off, Vox Machina, upon working

00:07:26.996 --> 00:07:33.891
on their bakery, the Slayer's Cake in Whitestone,
made a possible new hire who turned out to be a

00:07:33.953 --> 00:07:42.425
drow bounty hunter named K'rynn, who was sent here
to acquire Taryon Darrington and bring him back

00:07:42.425 --> 00:07:50.833
home to the city of Deastok In Wildmount. You guys
all, through a series of high-level magic scrying

00:07:50.887 --> 00:07:57.618
and transportation, managed to cut off this
specific bounty hunter on the outskirts of the

00:07:57.618 --> 00:08:05.120
city, and in doing so made an agreement to not
slay her where she stood, and instead possibly

00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:12.389
make a transaction down the road. You guys then
made your way into the city of Deastok to the

00:08:12.389 --> 00:08:23.072
Darrington Estate and were led up into the study
of Howaardt Darrington, father of Taryon, in which

00:08:23.072 --> 00:08:29.437
you all discussed the reasons of why he was
brought back, the current financial state of the

00:08:29.437 --> 00:08:42.141
family, and the intent to resolve and remedy
long-standing sins of the father, through you

00:08:42.141 --> 00:08:47.271
standing up and doing your family duty, from his
perspective. We left off as you guys had just

00:08:47.271 --> 00:08:53.798
finished that conversation. You've exited his study
and were about to go about your business. Coming

00:08:53.841 --> 00:08:59.812
off the tension of the conversation, you closed
behind you with a clack the heavy wooden doors of

00:08:59.812 --> 00:09:09.654
Howaardt's study. There you have Bertholt, who's
standing off to the side, the dragonborn servant

00:09:09.710 --> 00:09:17.944
of the Darrington family, waiting patiently, and you
all at this moment are at your own disposal. What

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.484
do you wish to do?

00:09:19.484 --> 00:09:30.550
SAM: Just before we move: the names that Dad had
told us about to maybe parlay with in the Myriad?

00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:31.916
LAURA: Korshad.

00:09:31.981 --> 00:09:33.103
SAM: Korshad?

00:09:33.103 --> 00:09:35.045
MATT: Korshad, yes.

00:09:35.045 --> 00:09:40.625
TRAVIS: And how much was the debt? It was
260,000?

00:09:40.625 --> 00:09:42.073
SAM: 230,000!

00:09:42.073 --> 00:09:44.505
MATT: 230,000 gold debt.

00:09:44.505 --> 00:09:47.329
SAM: But wait, wasn't there some other name, the
little--

00:09:47.369 --> 00:09:49.449
TRAVIS: Lydia!

00:09:49.449 --> 00:09:58.131
MATT: Lydia was who you are to be betrothed to,
and the location was the Grumpy Lily.

00:09:58.169 --> 00:10:04.829
MARISHA: I was questioning myself, I was like
there was no way something

00:10:04.829 --> 00:10:06.630
was called the Grumpy Lily.

00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:08.731
MATT: Had a stroke while taking notes in D&amp;D.
Grumpy Lily!

00:10:08.774 --> 00:10:11.825
LAURA: The Many is who we want to speak to.

00:10:11.825 --> 00:10:19.593
TALIESIN: Just as something that happened, during
that whole family conversation I was scanning the

00:10:19.593 --> 00:10:24.475
room and the bookshelves for anything interesting,
anything out of sorts, anything out of place.

00:10:24.475 --> 00:10:27.537
MATT: Make a retroactive perception check.

00:10:27.537 --> 00:10:29.763
SAM: A retroactive perception check!

00:10:29.763 --> 00:10:34.939
TALIESIN: I didn't want to-- yeah, I didn't see
shit. I just rolled a three; that's nothing.

00:10:34.939 --> 00:10:36.944
MATT: Rightly so!

00:10:36.944 --> 00:10:41.972
SAM: Retrograde! You know they always say that
retrograde perception is 20/20?

00:10:41.972 --> 00:10:43.166
MATT: What?

00:10:43.166 --> 00:10:46.944
TALIESIN: I appreciate what you were going for
there.

00:10:46.944 --> 00:11:02.110
SAM: Anyway, I would love to ask Bertholt if he
knows the location of my sister.

00:11:02.110 --> 00:11:10.495
MATT: "Well, if you are looking for Maryanne,
she's probably in her chambers."

00:11:10.552 --> 00:11:18.221
SAM: All right, well, I mean I guess we can &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt;
walk to her room and knock on the door. It's a

00:11:18.221 --> 00:11:19.613
little weird, right?

00:11:19.613 --> 00:11:22.193
LIAM: You want to go talk to her and touch base
with her first?

00:11:22.193 --> 00:11:23.702
You can introduce us to her after.

00:11:23.702 --> 00:11:31.048
SAM: Sure. I'll lead them back downstairs to that
main room that was all awful and terrible, right?

00:11:31.048 --> 00:11:34.796
MATT: Well, it was just dark and cold and empty.

00:11:34.796 --> 00:11:42.943
SAM: So I'll lead them down there. This was our
playroom, maybe you should just wait here and I'll

00:11:42.943 --> 00:11:45.397
go talk to sis. I'll be right back.

00:11:45.397 --> 00:11:46.895
LAURA: All right.

00:11:46.895 --> 00:11:49.163
TRAVIS: Is there like furniture to sit on, or is
it barren?

00:11:49.163 --> 00:11:53.655
MATT: No, no. There's furniture, and a lot of the
furniture here is really well made, dark woods,

00:11:53.655 --> 00:11:57.708
fine deep red and maroon fabrics. A lot of it has
dust on it.

00:11:57.708 --> 00:11:59.539
TALIESIN: Plastic covers? No plastic covers?

00:11:59.539 --> 00:12:04.018
MATT: No plastic covers. But some of the
furniture here is for use and some of it is here just

00:12:04.018 --> 00:12:06.736
as part of the decor, and it's very easy to see
which ones are which.

00:12:06.798 --> 00:12:09.243
LAURA: I'm definitely going to sit on the ones
that are just for decor.

00:12:09.243 --> 00:12:10.951
MATT: Okay, they're really uncomfortable.

00:12:10.990 --> 00:12:13.452
LAURA: Cool. Going to rub my butt all over it.

00:12:13.452 --> 00:12:22.998
MATT: You leave a little butt-print in the dust.
Perfect. At which point, Bertholt acknowledges

00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:30.336
that you guys will be staying. "Could I get
anything for you? Perhaps teas, juice, water?"

00:12:30.379 --> 00:12:33.009
TRAVIS: What is this bullshit, no ale?

00:12:33.009 --> 00:12:35.617
LAURA: Do you have fermented juice?

00:12:35.617 --> 00:12:41.959
MATT: "I'll fetch the wine." And he hobbles off to
acquire some means of imbibement.

00:12:41.959 --> 00:12:46.689
TRAVIS: Should we pay him? We just found out he's
dead fucking broke.

00:12:46.689 --> 00:12:50.016
LAURA: I'd rather not.

00:12:50.016 --> 00:12:51.773
TRAVIS: Okay.

00:12:51.773 --> 00:12:54.254
(laughter)

00:12:54.254 --> 00:13:00.587
MATT: Okay. You make your way back to the second
floor and off to the far western end of the

00:13:00.587 --> 00:13:08.524
estate, to what you recall being Maryanne's
chambers. So as you enter her room, which has

00:13:08.524 --> 00:13:18.824
become her own study, as you recall last time
seeing her, her room was becoming more and more of a

00:13:18.824 --> 00:13:26.865
functional office, and as you knock and push the
door open like a familiar brother does, not

00:13:26.907 --> 00:13:34.709
wishing for any patience on her end, necessarily,
you can see the interiors. The bed's there for function.

00:13:34.764 --> 00:13:41.433
Most if it is, I wouldn't say a replica, but it very
much resembles the decor and mood of your father's

00:13:41.486 --> 00:13:51.213
study. You see her currently sitting at a desk in
the corner. Her blonde hair is tied back in a

00:13:51.213 --> 00:13:57.494
tied braid that runs down her back. She wears a
coat and pants and seems to be dressed a little

00:13:57.494 --> 00:14:02.771
formally or businesslike for being casually at
home. You haven't really seen her dress like this

00:14:02.771 --> 00:14:10.862
before, at least not in a casual circumstance. As
you glance over past the doorway she looks up from

00:14:10.862 --> 00:14:16.929
her papers and goes, "Brother!"

00:14:16.929 --> 00:14:19.749
SAM: Hello, sister.

00:14:19.749 --> 00:14:25.581
MATT: "Brother, what--" She closes the book. You
can see she's been looking over ledgers and

00:14:25.581 --> 00:14:30.684
catalogues. Looks like she's been doing a fair
amount of work here at the desk and stands up in a

00:14:30.684 --> 00:14:35.740
very formal way and begins to step towards you.
"When have you arrived?"

00:14:35.740 --> 00:14:39.774
SAM: Just today. Father kidnapped me and brought
me home.

00:14:39.774 --> 00:14:45.031
MATT: "Kidnapped?"

00:14:45.031 --> 00:14:52.542
SAM: Well, I'm not a kid, but still works.
Abducted. Abducted me and brought me home. Paid

00:14:52.542 --> 00:14:54.183
someone to do it.

00:14:54.183 --> 00:14:55.258
MATT: "Right."

00:14:55.258 --> 00:15:05.448
SAM: Yes. Anyway, it's good to see you. Your room
is coming along quite nicely. It seems like you're

00:15:05.448 --> 00:15:07.551
running the show now, is that true?

00:15:07.551 --> 00:15:14.037
MATT: "No, not quite, but the responsibilities
have definitely been mounting. You look well. How

00:15:14.037 --> 00:15:18.885
"have the wind-tossed roads of Exandria
treated you this past year?"

00:15:18.885 --> 00:15:26.002
SAM: Well, I have had many adventures and close
calls, but I won't bore you with those details.

00:15:26.069 --> 00:15:33.686
It's been an interesting year abroad, and I would
say I'm glad to be back, but for the abduction

00:15:33.686 --> 00:15:40.889
part and also the fact that I've now learned 
that we are destitute? Is that true?

00:15:40.930 --> 00:15:45.133
MATT: "We're on the path to destitution, yes."

00:15:45.133 --> 00:15:49.191
SAM: So it's true; he wasn't just trying to guilt
me.

00:15:49.191 --> 00:16:00.128
MATT: "Probably both, to be honest. We're in a
relatively dire situation compared to our previous

00:16:00.128 --> 00:16:08.699
"long-standing lifestyle choices. We're trying to
fix this mess."

00:16:08.699 --> 00:16:13.397
SAM: And what would have been your plan had I not
arrived today?

00:16:13.397 --> 00:16:21.126
MATT: "Well, you were part of the plan. We're
trying to figure this out the best we can and

00:16:21.126 --> 00:16:36.665
"given the circumstances, we feel this is probably
one of the most viable and least dangerous or risky

00:16:36.665 --> 00:16:40.589
"endeavors in which we can right the family's
trajectory."

00:16:40.589 --> 00:16:44.548
SAM: By marrying me to some lady I've never met?

00:16:44.548 --> 00:16:48.560
MATT: "Oh, you're welcome to meet her. I've met
her. I helped to arrange this."

00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:50.623
SAM: What is she like?

00:16:50.623 --> 00:16:56.474
MATT: "She's very nice. She's very pretty, a bit
bookish, which once again would befit you rather

00:16:56.474 --> 00:17:05.860
"well, but let's be honest. This is a
political marriage. You do what you want. I mean,

00:17:06.053 --> 00:17:12.540
"there isn't a politician or a lord of this land
that hasn't in some way, shape, or form made their

00:17:12.540 --> 00:17:18.980
"own life outside of the family." At that point,
you noticed she gets a bit dark and seems to speak

00:17:19.027 --> 00:17:21.241
with this bit of sarcasm.

00:17:21.241 --> 00:17:31.423
SAM: And father's businesses, are they being run
the same way? With the same attention to detail?

00:17:31.423 --> 00:17:43.944
MATT: "There's been no necessary change to the way
business has been done. Other than the transition

00:17:43.944 --> 00:17:49.313
"of some responsibilities, of course." And she
gives a slight nod. She's getting a little

00:17:49.361 --> 00:17:52.354
uncomfortable as this conversation continues.

00:17:52.354 --> 00:18:03.344
SAM: Listen, I'm sorry to pop in like this and
challenge your judgment, but me marrying this

00:18:03.344 --> 00:18:09.221
person would solve our problems long-term?
Somehow?

00:18:09.261 --> 00:18:21.566
MATT: "Marrying into this family, the Truscan lot,
would enable us the resources and connections to

00:18:21.566 --> 00:18:30.908
"reacquire the deeds to our land, to reacquire the
business elements that we've been in this

00:18:30.908 --> 00:18:37.046
"unnecessary partnership with for some time, and
would enable us to once again reclaim complete

00:18:37.046 --> 00:18:42.443
"rulership of our family-controlled lands."

00:18:42.443 --> 00:18:44.893
SAM: Do we not own anything anymore?

00:18:44.893 --> 00:18:51.876
MATT: "It is a partnership that is quickly
sliding into the behest of the Myriad."

00:18:51.941 --> 00:18:57.410
SAM: So what is ours now? Anything? Our personal
belongings? This home?

00:18:57.410 --> 00:19:06.788
MATT: "We still own everything, in partnership.
Own solely on our own? Some of the furniture."

00:19:06.788 --> 00:19:20.681
SAM: And again, if I do this, what's to say we're
not just going to drive up another debt again?

00:19:20.681 --> 00:19:30.609
Doesn't seem like father or you have been very
good at keeping us in the black.

00:19:30.609 --> 00:19:36.309
MATT: "I have only been recently brought into this
unfortunate circumstance, brother. And you can

00:19:36.309 --> 00:19:41.596
"trust in knowing that in my studies and my time
spent here, working with father, being very clear,

00:19:41.596 --> 00:19:44.443
"and very thorough with the mistakes he's made
in the past,

00:19:44.484 --> 00:19:46.678
"I will not be doomed to repeat them."

00:19:46.678 --> 00:19:53.614
SAM: So you and he are two peas in a pod, yes?

00:19:53.614 --> 00:20:01.857
MATT: "Well, he's certainly in need of retiring
based on the stress he's put upon himself. It would

00:20:02.007 --> 00:20:07.100
"not be long until I will take over the
responsibilities."

00:20:07.100 --> 00:20:17.132
SAM: Well, I may poke around and see if there's
another way I could help. But before I do, is this

00:20:17.187 --> 00:20:23.220
fun for you? Do you like running this business, or
almost running it?

00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:28.394
MATT: "It's certainly a better challenge than many
other daughters of lords

00:20:28.394 --> 00:20:30.334
"are given in their time."

00:20:30.334 --> 00:20:32.985
SAM: Do you have any friends?

00:20:32.985 --> 00:20:43.187
MATT: "Friends come, when the money and power's
in place. You know this."

00:20:43.227 --> 00:20:44.986
SAM: I do.

00:20:44.986 --> 00:20:49.151
MATT: "It's the way the land works."

00:20:49.151 --> 00:21:01.171
SAM: Well, I'll leave you to your work, and-- love
the decorations. I'm considering the offer and

00:21:01.171 --> 00:21:06.171
I'll have an answer for you by tomorrow morning.

00:21:06.171 --> 00:21:12.857
MATT: "Wonderful." As you begin to make any sort
of exit, she catches you and goes, "Brother,

00:21:12.857 --> 00:21:22.618
"your arrival here is a great boon to us. You have
the power to change the fate of this family.

00:21:22.618 --> 00:21:30.030
"Consider the respect you have for the people who
have worked their entire lives to provide for you

00:21:30.030 --> 00:21:40.302
"what you have been given. Mother and Father 
sacrificed so much for us. Consider weighing one's

00:21:40.359 --> 00:21:45.802
"selfish interest versus the importance of a
bloodline. That is all I ask."

00:21:45.802 --> 00:21:51.379
SAM: All right. I'll consider it. With all my
intellect.

00:21:51.420 --> 00:21:57.343
MATT: "Well, it's good to see you." She steps
forward and gives you a half-hug.

00:21:57.398 --> 00:21:59.307
It's like--

00:21:59.307 --> 00:22:07.983
SAM: A pat. The back pat. Good day.

00:22:07.997 --> 00:22:13.800
MATT: "Good day." She straightens her coat and 
sits back behind her desk

00:22:13.803 --> 00:22:16.002
and waits for you to leave.

00:22:16.002 --> 00:22:26.803
SAM: All right. I'll shimmy out. (sighs) All
right, I'll rejoin my friends downstairs. Well--

00:22:26.866 --> 00:22:28.229
LAURA: How did it go?

00:22:28.229 --> 00:22:29.704
LIAM: Well, yourself.

00:22:29.704 --> 00:22:38.696
SAM: As expected. Things are about the same
between me and Maryanne.

00:22:38.696 --> 00:22:40.430
LAURA: Is she still a raging bitch?

00:22:40.430 --> 00:22:42.481
SAM: No, she's not raging.

00:22:42.481 --> 00:22:45.884
ASHLEY: I just think it's rather rude that she
doesn't want to come down here and meet us.

00:22:45.884 --> 00:22:47.531
SAM: She has her work and her--

00:22:47.531 --> 00:22:49.236
LIAM: Oh, she's not coming down?

00:22:49.236 --> 00:22:50.530
SAM: No.

00:22:50.530 --> 00:22:51.985
LIAM: That's weird.

00:22:51.985 --> 00:22:57.499
SAM: I mean, I don't know, she's busy. I guess.

00:22:57.499 --> 00:22:58.883
LIAM: Okay.

00:22:58.883 --> 00:23:04.324
SAM: They're not guest people. They're not dinner
party family.

00:23:04.324 --> 00:23:05.748
LIAM: We picked up on that.

00:23:05.748 --> 00:23:13.094
LAURA: Not even for people who could help them with
their name?

00:23:13.148 --> 00:23:20.366
MARISHA: Did you mention us or anything else?

00:23:20.366 --> 00:23:22.795
SAM: Nope. It didn't come up.

00:23:22.795 --> 00:23:27.019
LIAM: Did they have any idea what a heavy hitter
you are now? The type of people you roll with?

00:23:27.019 --> 00:23:31.363
SAM: They said, how have I been? But they don't
really give a shit either way.

00:23:31.363 --> 00:23:34.522
MARISHA: So you didn't even offer up the
information?

00:23:34.567 --> 00:23:39.631
SAM: If they are not interested in me, why should
I be interested in them knowing about me?

00:23:39.631 --> 00:23:41.263
LAURA: That's a very good point.

00:23:41.263 --> 00:23:47.867
LIAM: Let's back it up. What are you thinking?
Where's your head at? How can we help you?

00:23:47.867 --> 00:23:58.759
SAM: I don't know what to do. There's this woman;
she's apparently nice and I could go for it and

00:23:58.766 --> 00:24:03.810
marry her, and then it seems like all my family
problems would be okay.

00:24:03.810 --> 00:24:05.147
ASHLEY: Forever?

00:24:05.194 --> 00:24:10.215
MARISHA: There's no such thing as family problems
being okay for forever.

00:24:10.281 --> 00:24:11.959
TRAVIS: Really?

00:24:11.959 --> 00:24:20.156
SAM: I don't know. I'm sort of curious about talking
to the people who are in this contract with my

00:24:20.214 --> 00:24:28.610
father and seeing if there's any way to wiggle out
of it a little bit, but I don't know how to solve

00:24:28.610 --> 00:24:39.115
everything right now. I also don't know-- I feel a
duty, a responsibility to this family, because

00:24:39.115 --> 00:24:40.622
they are my family.

00:24:40.622 --> 00:24:42.334
MARISHA: Grog!

00:24:42.334 --> 00:24:51.053
TRAVIS: You feel a doodie? The privy is over there!
Or over there! Or the front yard beckons.

00:24:51.204 --> 00:24:53.877
TALIESIN: He may have opened a bottle of wine.

00:24:53.918 --> 00:24:56.463
TRAVIS: I'm lost for the rest of this
conversation.

00:24:56.522 --> 00:25:01.532
LAURA: No, we're not drunk, we may have just had a 
little bit of wine, just a small amount.

00:25:01.580 --> 00:25:04.216
TRAVIS: I carved my name into the floor.

00:25:04.216 --> 00:25:14.583
SAM: Part of me wants to-- oh god. Part of me
wants to turn around and go back with you to

00:25:14.583 --> 00:25:20.384
Whitestone and forget that the Darringtons exist,
but I don't think I can't do that. I am a

00:25:20.384 --> 00:25:29.736
Darrington and I owe it at least to my name to
try and fix what I can.

00:25:29.789 --> 00:25:31.034
LAURA: That's your plan?

00:25:31.034 --> 00:25:31.892
SAM: Yes.

00:25:31.892 --> 00:25:34.206
LAURA: Don't sacrifice your entire life
for this, though.

00:25:34.247 --> 00:25:38.335
SAM: Well, I'll try not to, but it seems like a
plan B at this point.

00:25:38.335 --> 00:25:45.111
LIAM: Also, you had no prior knowledge to your
family's connection to the mob?

00:25:45.154 --> 00:25:54.146
SAM: No? It's way cooler than I thought my family
ever was. I knew my dad did shady business with

00:25:54.146 --> 00:26:01.845
lots of shady characters but I never knew-- I
assumed he paid off people. I assumed he had

00:26:01.845 --> 00:26:09.957
friends in high places and people who you'd have
to bribe to turn the other cheek, but I never knew

00:26:09.957 --> 00:26:24.225
that he was in business with them, owing our whole
existence to these terrible people, and I don't

00:26:24.225 --> 00:26:26.465
know what to make of that

00:26:26.465 --> 00:26:34.994
LIAM: T, I think we're all prepared to help you do
anything you want to do, but are you sure you want

00:26:34.994 --> 00:26:39.515
to help perpetuate the family business?

00:26:39.515 --> 00:26:45.113
SAM: Definitely not. Listen, I think there's two
steps to this: there's the short term and the long

00:26:45.113 --> 00:26:53.451
term. We have to solve this short-term need really
quickly. Not this whole 230,000-dollar-- I mean

00:26:53.451 --> 00:27:06.631
-gold debt. It's a Whitestone term, I mean a
Wildmount. Oh my god. My phone rang! I'm confused!

00:27:06.689 --> 00:27:18.695
Anyway, listen, couple drinks before-- no. We
have a short-term problem that we can maybe go

00:27:18.695 --> 00:27:24.906
alleviate a bit if we go talk to these folk at the
Laughing Ninny or whatever it's called.

00:27:24.906 --> 00:27:26.865
The Grumpy Lily.

00:27:26.865 --> 00:27:33.295
LIAM: I like the Laughing Ninny. I kinda want to go
there instead.

00:27:33.445 --> 00:27:35.828
TALIESIN: It's a stand-up comedy club.

00:27:35.828 --> 00:27:40.760
(laughter)

00:27:40.760 --> 00:27:46.784
SAM: And then there's a long-term problem which
I'll have to solve on another day. There's a long-

00:27:46.784 --> 00:27:52.198
term problem that my family is awful and needs to
be stopped at all costs, and that's something that

00:27:52.242 --> 00:27:54.427
I'll have to deal with tomorrow.

00:27:54.427 --> 00:28:01.174
LAURA: Do the Truscans, that's who you are being
married into potentially, do they have a son?

00:28:01.174 --> 00:28:06.294
TALIESIN: That doesn't help! That's almost beside
the point!

00:28:06.294 --> 00:28:09.484
SAM: You're talking about marrying the sister?
Yeah.

00:28:09.541 --> 00:28:11.233
TALIESIN: Oh, that's still--

00:28:11.233 --> 00:28:13.315
LAURA: I guess it's not the same, is it?

00:28:13.512 --> 00:28:17.148
TALIESIN: No! Actually, it's unfortunately
the opposite.

00:28:17.191 --> 00:28:19.795
SAM: You're royalty. You know this!

00:28:19.795 --> 00:28:22.194
LAURA: Of course, I know everything about
royalty.

00:28:22.194 --> 00:28:23.870
SAM: Little royal girl.

00:28:23.870 --> 00:28:34.996
MARISHA: What exactly is your duty that you are
feeling inclined towards? Damn it, Grog!

00:28:34.996 --> 00:28:36.518
TALIESIN: Lilah? Is it Lilah?

00:28:36.518 --> 00:28:37.602
ALL: Lydia.

00:28:37.602 --> 00:28:42.611
TALIESIN: Perhaps we should talk to this Lydia as
well, because she is obviously in a position of

00:28:42.665 --> 00:28:44.776
being told what she is going to do with herself.

00:28:44.776 --> 00:28:46.890
MARISHA: Yeah! Maybe she's also a badass!

00:28:46.900 --> 00:28:50.250
LIAM: At the very least, we should meet all the chess
pieces on the board, right?

00:28:50.292 --> 00:28:55.544
SAM: I mean, she lives in another part of the
kingdom, right, Matthew Mercer?

00:28:55.590 --> 00:28:58.249
MARISHA: That's not a problem.

00:28:58.249 --> 00:29:04.514
SAM: Oh yes, that's true. But there's the in-town
people we can meet first.

00:29:04.514 --> 00:29:07.494
LAURA: Sure. Let's talk to the mob!

00:29:07.494 --> 00:29:12.735
SAM: Yes, of course! You'll come with me? Because
I can't talk to the mob by myself.

00:29:12.735 --> 00:29:14.037
LAURA: Tary, of course we will!

00:29:14.037 --> 00:29:16.144
TRAVIS: Wait, when you said we need to stop your
family at all costs,

00:29:16.144 --> 00:29:17.560
are you talking about killing them?

00:29:17.560 --> 00:29:19.418
SAM: No, I'm not talking about killing them.

00:29:19.418 --> 00:29:24.198
MARISHA: Yeah, but Grog does bring up a point that
I was trying to make before he started laughing

00:29:24.198 --> 00:29:37.894
when I said "duty." (giggles) But what, are you
committed to keeping your family around? You said

00:29:37.894 --> 00:29:43.263
you were compelled and you felt like you had a duty
but then you immediately started talking about--

00:29:43.263 --> 00:29:46.209
TALIESIN: Stop it, Travis! God, I can't--

00:29:46.265 --> 00:29:50.948
MARISHA: Tearing your family apart? And stopping
them?

00:29:50.948 --> 00:30:02.697
SAM: My family is pretty bad, I've learned. But
I've also learned from young Trickfoot that even a

00:30:02.697 --> 00:30:14.730
rotten family is worth trying to save. And I
admire the path that she took with her family, and

00:30:14.730 --> 00:30:26.374
I would like to at least try to push mine in the
right direction and try to make our name a little

00:30:26.374 --> 00:30:30.019
less shitty.

00:30:30.019 --> 00:30:32.483
LIAM: That is a pretty big matzo ball, my friend.

00:30:32.483 --> 00:30:37.852
SAM: Well, that's why that's long term. In the
short term, I just want to get them safe.

00:30:37.919 --> 00:30:46.394
MARISHA: If there's one thing I understand, it's
giving your life to a cause.

00:30:46.394 --> 00:30:50.202
SAM: I don't want to die, if that's what you're
saying.

00:30:50.202 --> 00:30:52.835
MARISHA: No.

00:30:52.835 --> 00:30:54.285
SAM: Dedicating.

00:30:54.285 --> 00:30:55.204
MARISHA: Dedicating.

00:30:55.204 --> 00:30:56.573
SAM: Thank you.

00:30:56.573 --> 00:30:59.017
MARISHA: Time is a gift, I would say.

00:30:59.017 --> 00:31:00.050
SAM: Sure.

00:31:00.050 --> 00:31:06.206
MARISHA: So dedicating that gift is, it's a big
thing, but I hope you believe in it.

00:31:06.206 --> 00:31:12.263
SAM: I don't believe in them, but I believe in the
cause right now,

00:31:12.263 --> 00:31:15.083
and we'll see how far that takes us.

00:31:15.083 --> 00:31:16.848
MARISHA: We believe in you.

00:31:16.848 --> 00:31:20.113
SAM: You guys.

00:31:20.113 --> 00:31:23.660
TRAVIS: Can you describe to me this duty?

00:31:23.660 --> 00:31:26.718
MARISHA: You don't care!

00:31:26.718 --> 00:31:31.754
TRAVIS: I think I do now. Is it real hard?

00:31:31.754 --> 00:31:37.986
SAM: It's a little more nebulous than that, Grog.

00:31:37.986 --> 00:31:40.576
TALIESIN: We can pass on this for now.

00:31:40.576 --> 00:31:43.574
TRAVIS: Adjectives are not my strong suit, so.

00:31:43.574 --> 00:31:46.946
LAURA: You know what an adjective is! That's
impressive.

00:31:46.946 --> 00:31:51.295
TRAVIS: Yeah. No, I got it one time at this
tavern. I had it for two nights.

00:31:51.295 --> 00:31:53.847
It just itched everywhere.

00:31:53.847 --> 00:31:56.864
SAM: Listen. When you see my duty, you'll know.

00:31:56.864 --> 00:32:00.001
TRAVIS: Copy that.

00:32:00.001 --> 00:32:03.725
LIAM: It's loose. This duty is loose.

00:32:03.725 --> 00:32:06.204
LAURA: Should we go to the Grumpy Lily, then?

00:32:06.204 --> 00:32:07.410
TALIESIN: Please.

00:32:07.410 --> 00:32:09.887
LAURA: This is going so well.

00:32:09.887 --> 00:32:15.279
MATT: As you're exiting the house and Berthold's
opening the door, you hear some heavy creaking

00:32:15.336 --> 00:32:25.699
from the stair that leads down to the main area,
and you watch as an older woman in her early

00:32:25.699 --> 00:32:32.462
fifties or so with her mid-length, curly brown
hair in shades of gray, green eyes behind a small

00:32:32.462 --> 00:32:40.742
set of reading spectacles, stoic of face, wearing
what looks to be some sort of a finely crafted

00:32:40.742 --> 00:32:49.497
silk robe, clutching a book under her arm, comes
down the steps and looks down and goes, "Taryon?"

00:32:49.497 --> 00:32:51.630
SAM: Mama?

00:32:51.630 --> 00:32:56.492
MATT: "Taryon, my boy!" And she sets the book down
and walks up, puts her hands out as she says,

00:32:56.492 --> 00:33:05.965
"Oh," takes you at the sides of the face and pulls
you in for (kisses). "Oh, terribly sorry. I

00:33:05.965 --> 00:33:07.734
"didn't realize that we had guests."

00:33:07.734 --> 00:33:15.591
SAM: Oh, yes, these are my allies and my friends.
This is the team known as Vox Machina. They are a

00:33:15.591 --> 00:33:19.885
fearless band of adventurers and they have taken
me in as their own.

00:33:19.885 --> 00:33:22.248
MATT: "Look at you, so rugged!"

00:33:22.248 --> 00:33:25.795
SAM: Well. Yes, I am, a bit!

00:33:25.795 --> 00:33:28.941
MATT: "So you've had some adventures with my boy,
have you?

00:33:28.941 --> 00:33:30.727
ALL: We have.

00:33:30.727 --> 00:33:36.210
MATT: "That's wonderful. Have you spoken with your
father?"

00:33:36.210 --> 00:33:46.900
SAM: Yes, I've spoken to Father, and Sister, and
it's good to know they're healthy. And it's lovely

00:33:46.900 --> 00:33:52.026
to see you, as well. Have you been happy at all,
this last year?

00:33:52.026 --> 00:34:01.701
MATT: "I--" And she reaches back and takes the
book off the step and goes, "I've been making my

00:34:01.701 --> 00:34:04.140
"way through your library."

00:34:04.140 --> 00:34:07.263
SAM: Oh! Oh, my books, in my room.

00:34:07.263 --> 00:34:13.667
MATT: "Yes! Well, I've had a lot of time to
myself. Been a bit under the weather for some

00:34:13.667 --> 00:34:17.123
"time, and these have kept me fine company."

00:34:17.123 --> 00:34:26.844
SAM: Oh. That's lovely. I hope you've enjoyed them
as much as I did. What's your favorite one?

00:34:26.844 --> 00:34:40.018
MATT: "Well, not this piece of trash." And she
sets it down. "There's one. What was it called?

00:34:40.018 --> 00:34:45.817
"The River's Dawn. It was a brilliant--"

00:34:45.817 --> 00:34:47.745
SAM: Before the River's Dawn, yes.

00:34:47.745 --> 00:35:00.165
MATT: "Before the River's Dawn! That one, yes. It
was a continuation of the creation myth of

00:35:00.165 --> 00:35:06.703
"Wildmount, but it turned into the spirits of the
gods, these two fauns, and they fell in love but

00:35:06.703 --> 00:35:10.807
"could not be together because the dawn had to rise
and the sun would shine.

00:35:10.807 --> 00:35:12.931
"It was very, very beautiful!"

00:35:12.931 --> 00:35:15.547
SAM: Yes, yes! No it was, but also heartbreaking
at the same time.

00:35:15.547 --> 00:35:17.881
MATT: "Very much so. It reminded me of you."

00:35:17.881 --> 00:35:22.859
SAM: Yes. That's one of my favorites, as well.

00:35:22.859 --> 00:35:27.801
MATT: "Well. I didn't break the binding too much,
I hope."

00:35:27.801 --> 00:35:30.401
SAM: I'll fix it if you did. It's all right.

00:35:30.401 --> 00:35:31.556
MATT: "All right."

00:35:31.556 --> 00:35:40.637
SAM: Well, that's wonderful to hear. I'm glad
you've been entertaining yourself. I know living

00:35:40.637 --> 00:35:45.842
with Papa can be very hard, and it's been very
hard on you all these years.

00:35:45.842 --> 00:35:58.932
MATT: "If you would excuse us for just a moment,
please. Just a few moments." And she points

00:35:58.932 --> 00:36:00.345
towards the door.

00:36:00.345 --> 00:36:01.567
SAM: I told you they were like this.

00:36:01.567 --> 00:36:03.970
TRAVIS: Yeah, no, we're going out the front door.
Front yard.

00:36:03.970 --> 00:36:06.346
MARISHA: Bottle of wine!

00:36:06.346 --> 00:36:10.307
MATT: Berthold is leading you out of the main area,
out the front door.

00:36:10.307 --> 00:36:11.528
TRAVIS: Yeah, front door!

00:36:11.528 --> 00:36:13.525
LAURA: Out the house, like get out?

00:36:13.525 --> 00:36:15.014
MATT: You guys were on your way out.

00:36:15.014 --> 00:36:16.486
SAM: Just wait on the fucking porch!

00:36:16.486 --> 00:36:19.166
LIAM: We got it.

00:36:19.166 --> 00:36:21.223
LAURA: Fine.

00:36:21.223 --> 00:36:31.931
MATT: As soon as she has some privacy with you,
she goes, "My boy, if you could indulge me in some

00:36:31.931 --> 00:36:45.713
"strange honesty, I'm rather intrigued at this
idea. I don't wish to undermine anything that

00:36:45.713 --> 00:36:54.427
"we've built as a family. I've lived a privileged
life for a very long time, far longer than you and

00:36:54.427 --> 00:37:07.258
"your sister have. I've lived within this house,
removed from the world. I do as responsibility

00:37:07.258 --> 00:37:19.952
"asks of me, my wedded duties as both a wife and a
mother, and I do so without complaint. I have

00:37:20.002 --> 00:37:26.806
"always seen you fight these same circumstances
bravely, and I find vicarious joy in your escape

00:37:26.806 --> 00:37:43.440
"from this place this past year. These books are a
reminder of that same bravery. I know Howaardt has

00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:59.140
"said many things, and he may be right. But there's
a little part of me that welcomes a little change

00:37:59.140 --> 00:38:09.729
"in scenery and lifestyle. Maybe that's what the
family needs. I don't know. Perhaps I'm foolhardy.

00:38:09.729 --> 00:38:10.720
"I know not."

00:38:10.720 --> 00:38:21.822
SAM: No, you're right to think this way. This year
has been eye-opening for me, and I know that you

00:38:21.822 --> 00:38:31.563
care for Papa, and you are a diligent and faithful
wife. But I know how hard it must have been to

00:38:31.563 --> 00:38:40.718
live this life for so many years and I wonder what
it would be like if you hadn't been with him, what

00:38:40.718 --> 00:38:43.802
kind of person you would be.

00:38:43.802 --> 00:38:49.002
MATT: "Looking at you, looking at your sister, I
wouldn't change it for the world."

00:38:49.002 --> 00:38:59.385
SAM: Well, things are going to have to change at
some point, right?

00:38:59.385 --> 00:39:14.811
MATT: "One way or another. I just-- (sighs) I just
want you to make choices for yourself. I want you

00:39:14.811 --> 00:39:30.115
"to do what you think is right, that you could live
with. Duty and blood is one thing, but... Anyway,

00:39:30.115 --> 00:39:32.527
"I'm talking out of turn."

00:39:32.527 --> 00:39:36.754
SAM: No. Thank you. Thank you for that.

00:39:36.754 --> 00:39:42.915
MATT: "Could you not tell Howaardt we've had this
conversation?"

00:39:42.915 --> 00:39:56.454
SAM: Mum's the word. All right. I'll be back, and
maybe we'll have time to talk more books later.

00:39:56.454 --> 00:39:58.251
MATT: "I would like that very much."

00:39:58.251 --> 00:40:00.702
SAM: Good evening.

00:40:00.702 --> 00:40:08.750
MATT: "Good evening." As you leave, she's like,
"Oh! The other one I was trying to remember was

00:40:08.750 --> 00:40:13.827
"The Mountain Range of Gold. It was a wonderful
three-part series--"

00:40:13.827 --> 00:40:16.852
SAM: When you think he's dead, but he's not, and
he comes back?

00:40:16.852 --> 00:40:19.703
MATT: "Well, the second book, you get halfway
through it before he even turns

00:40:19.703 --> 00:40:20.721
"and reveals himself!"

00:40:20.721 --> 00:40:24.595
SAM: I know! Well, you never see the body in the
first one, so that should have been a tip-off.

00:40:24.595 --> 00:40:29.572
MATT: "And then the white robes and everything!
His renewed power, it's incredible! Anyway, I'm

00:40:29.572 --> 00:40:34.533
"sorry, you have your friends waiting on you. Good
night, Taryon."

00:40:34.533 --> 00:40:36.096
SAM: Yes.

00:40:36.096 --> 00:40:37.903
LIAM: I want to adopt her.

00:40:37.903 --> 00:40:39.508
MARISHA: She's awesome!

00:40:39.508 --> 00:40:44.152
MATT: So as you step out to greet the rest of your
friends?

00:40:44.152 --> 00:40:49.848
SAM: All right, let's go to the Jumping Jimmy, or
whatever it's called.

00:40:49.848 --> 00:40:51.290
LAURA: How's your mother?

00:40:51.290 --> 00:41:04.215
SAM: She's better. I mean, she's had a tough time.
That was the longest conversation I've had with

00:41:04.215 --> 00:41:06.562
her in many years.

00:41:06.562 --> 00:41:08.404
LAURA: Wow.

00:41:08.404 --> 00:41:12.030
ASHLEY: She said she's under the weather. What's
wrong?

00:41:12.030 --> 00:41:18.289
SAM: I think everybody's super stressed out and
heartsick about everything that's happening, and

00:41:18.289 --> 00:41:30.372
living under a tyrant of a father is not healthy.
You should have seen me when I lived here. I was

00:41:30.372 --> 00:41:37.703
not nearly as dashing or as charming as I am now.
It took me spreading my wings and flying before I

00:41:37.703 --> 00:41:44.855
found my sense of humor. My hair looks better, my
eyes look better.

00:41:44.855 --> 00:41:47.834
MARISHA: I thought you said that was because of
the aloe vera.

00:41:47.834 --> 00:41:50.116
SAM: Well, yes. We didn't have any at home.

00:41:50.116 --> 00:41:56.254
MARISHA: Right, yeah. Salt air is better for you.

00:41:56.254 --> 00:42:04.428
SAM: I mean, life needs aloe to live. Is something
I always say.

00:42:04.428 --> 00:42:09.163
TALIESIN: That's true.

00:42:09.163 --> 00:42:12.113
LIAM: I've heard you say that two or three times.

00:42:12.113 --> 00:42:17.336
SAM: Moisturizing products in general. Life needs
moisturizing products to live.

00:42:17.336 --> 00:42:20.002
TALIESIN: Life needs moisture to live.

00:42:20.002 --> 00:42:23.804
ASHLEY: I know my beauty regimen's changed.

00:42:23.804 --> 00:42:27.492
MARISHA: Life needs moisture to live. It's way
smarter-sounding.

00:42:27.492 --> 00:42:31.642
TALIESIN: All right, gauntlet dropped.

00:42:31.642 --> 00:42:36.502
LAURA: All right, to the Laughing Ninny it is.

00:42:36.502 --> 00:42:41.177
MATT: All right. Who's leading this charge?
Probably you, Taryon.

00:42:41.177 --> 00:42:42.972
SAM: I know the place.

00:42:42.972 --> 00:42:44.765
LIAM: You are in charge while we're here.

00:42:44.765 --> 00:42:48.025
MATT: You've never been to this place. You've
heard of it, but you'd never be seen dead in a

00:42:48.025 --> 00:42:54.806
place like this before. You lead your way in. At
this point, because when you arrived the sun was

00:42:54.806 --> 00:43:02.397
still in the sky, but it was deep in the sky, so
by now it's post-dusk. You now see the massive

00:43:02.397 --> 00:43:10.475
stone and wood structures of Deastok are dark
against the ever-dark sky with the windows now

00:43:10.475 --> 00:43:18.327
aglow, this warm yellows and orange of the candle
and lantern-lit interiors. You can see there are

00:43:18.327 --> 00:43:21.671
hanging lanterns that are put out there, and you
can see a number of individuals who seem to work

00:43:21.671 --> 00:43:27.281
for the city, who go and place these lanterns up in
each of these poles, are now finishing their job

00:43:27.430 --> 00:43:33.504
and are returning to the evening. Following these
lamps, along the street, the cobblestones are

00:43:33.504 --> 00:43:41.049
still really well kept for as old as this town
seems to be. For a city that isn't a major

00:43:41.049 --> 00:43:48.707
metropolis within a kingdom, and what your
experience has been in Tal'Dorei, a fair amount of

00:43:48.707 --> 00:43:56.468
money still makes it way through this city.
Eventually, you find your way fairly far north

00:43:56.468 --> 00:44:02.106
into the city until you come across the exterior
of the Grumpy Lily. Asking a few questions to

00:44:02.106 --> 00:44:07.725
guide you to which building it is, it's much smaller
than you expected. You see what appears to be a

00:44:07.725 --> 00:44:18.413
single-story pub with one window, one door, no
more than maybe 30 feet on any given side. It is

00:44:18.413 --> 00:44:26.874
lit from the inside, though it's dimly lit. As you
approach and push past the somewhat ajar entryway,

00:44:26.874 --> 00:44:36.383
you see before you what appears to be three
tables. Three singular, stained, brown tables. One

00:44:36.383 --> 00:44:41.876
lone patron sits at the center table, an elderly
man inspecting a small, clay sculpture that he's

00:44:41.876 --> 00:44:48.619
enraptured by, and a single barkeep to your right
that seems to notice your entry. A healthy, pale

00:44:48.619 --> 00:44:54.127
woman of brunette hair in her forties, dressed in
a simple gray blouse. As soon as you enter and

00:44:54.127 --> 00:45:00.760
take in the atmosphere, she goes, "Slow day,
folks! Happy to have the business!

00:45:00.760 --> 00:45:02.854
"What can I get you?"

00:45:02.854 --> 00:45:05.559
LIAM: Jeez, Grog, I don't even know if you're
going to fit in here.

00:45:05.559 --> 00:45:07.862
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's really tiny.

00:45:07.862 --> 00:45:10.593
MATT: Your head does reach the ceiling.

00:45:10.593 --> 00:45:11.696
TRAVIS: Shit.

00:45:11.696 --> 00:45:13.795
LAURA: Just dive in then?

00:45:13.795 --> 00:45:16.801
SAM: Should we get anything to drink first? Or
just dive in?

00:45:16.801 --> 00:45:19.446
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's like how you have to buy
something to use the restroom.

00:45:19.446 --> 00:45:28.777
MARISHA: Do you have a shiraz? I was just
wondering if you had any imports. Do you have a

00:45:28.777 --> 00:45:29.746
red wine?

00:45:29.746 --> 00:45:35.728
MATT: "Yes! That I can get for you, dear. Don't
worry. Red wine we can do definitely." She walks

00:45:35.728 --> 00:45:41.340
over and slams her hand on the side of the bar and
what you thought was once the patron now appears

00:45:41.340 --> 00:45:47.153
to be the one barman there. "Wait! What! Oh. I
missed the conversation."

00:45:47.153 --> 00:45:49.096
TRAVIS: Oh the guy with the sculpture?

00:45:49.096 --> 00:45:52.587
MATT: Yeah. "Red wine, for our guests."

00:45:52.587 --> 00:45:58.590
"Oh." He stands up and begrudgingly walks over.
You see his back is hunched forward and he's

00:45:58.590 --> 00:46:01.828
(pained grunting). Leaves the room for a second.

00:46:01.828 --> 00:46:04.321
"Well, sit down, find a place wherever you like."

00:46:04.321 --> 00:46:09.093
SAM: Put two tables together, I guess?

00:46:09.093 --> 00:46:10.686
LAURA: All three, really.

00:46:10.686 --> 00:46:12.512
MARISHA: Let's just take them all.

00:46:12.512 --> 00:46:17.124
TRAVIS: Wait, this is the meeting place of a dark
group, right? A shady group? Shouldn't we check

00:46:17.124 --> 00:46:19.311
this area for anything shady?

00:46:19.311 --> 00:46:25.097
TALIESIN: Is there shade in this establishment?

00:46:25.097 --> 00:46:27.611
MATT: It's dimly lit, so there's plenty of
shadows.

00:46:27.611 --> 00:46:36.094
LIAM: It's a five-by-five square. Do we see
anything amiss? Oh, that's terrible. 24.

00:46:36.094 --> 00:46:43.548
MATT: Nothing seems amiss. It seems like a shitty
pub. It's the definition of a

00:46:43.548 --> 00:46:45.581
poorly attended dive.

00:46:45.581 --> 00:46:51.774
LAURA: Does it look like there's any seams in the
ground that would be a trapdoor or anything?

00:46:51.834 --> 00:46:55.704
MATT: You can make an investigation check if you
want to.

00:46:55.704 --> 00:46:58.762
LAURA: 17.

00:46:58.762 --> 00:47:05.238
MATT: You begin to look around the floor and keep
perspective around the area. No. You see some

00:47:05.238 --> 00:47:09.753
stains, you see some crumbs, and at one point you
look over in the corner and you see what appears

00:47:09.753 --> 00:47:13.122
to be a piece of stale bread that's been left
under one of the tables and there are three rats

00:47:13.122 --> 00:47:16.694
currently eating it. As soon as you lean in, they
all stop and look at you and scatter.

00:47:16.694 --> 00:47:18.411
LAURA: Oh, you can keep going.

00:47:18.411 --> 00:47:21.970
TALIESIN: Could be worse. They could not be afraid
of you.

00:47:21.970 --> 00:47:23.130
LAURA: That's true.

00:47:23.130 --> 00:47:26.027
MATT: (laughs) They just give you the fuck-you
look and keep eating their bread.

00:47:26.180 --> 00:47:31.365
TALIESIN: That's when you know you've really found
the right bar. The rats were like: "We reserved

00:47:31.365 --> 00:47:36.020
"this table two weeks ago. You have to make a phone
call."

00:47:36.020 --> 00:47:41.152
MATT: The elderly barman walks in now and he's got
two bottles of red wine and he's shuffling.

00:47:41.152 --> 00:47:49.990
(grunts, clinks) "I'll get your cups." Turns
around and starts shuffling back.

00:47:49.990 --> 00:47:52.866
LAURA: (laughing) Do you need any help?

00:47:52.866 --> 00:47:55.811
MARISHA: I mean we have-- Oh, it's fine.

00:47:55.811 --> 00:47:57.695
TALIESIN: Just let it happen.

00:47:57.695 --> 00:48:01.875
SAM: Okay. Who do you think we proposition here?
The old man?

00:48:01.875 --> 00:48:02.845
LIAM: That guy.

00:48:02.845 --> 00:48:05.576
SAM: That guy? Really? What makes you say that?

00:48:05.576 --> 00:48:07.326
TALIESIN: Shifty eyes.

00:48:07.326 --> 00:48:09.401
LIAM: Shifty yeah, may be an act, even.

00:48:09.401 --> 00:48:11.649
SAM: He's just old I thought. No?

00:48:11.649 --> 00:48:13.169
LAURA: Nobody's just old.

00:48:13.169 --> 00:48:15.019
LIAM: He's many things.

00:48:15.019 --> 00:48:16.950
MARISHA: That's true, look at Pike's grandpa.

00:48:16.950 --> 00:48:18.466
LIAM: Look at Pike.

00:48:18.466 --> 00:48:20.321
ASHLEY: Look at me.

00:48:20.321 --> 00:48:25.302
LIAM: How old are you, again?

00:48:25.302 --> 00:48:27.841
ASHLEY: 142.

00:48:27.841 --> 00:48:29.144
LIAM: I said goddamn.

00:48:29.144 --> 00:48:30.525
SAM: Is that true?

00:48:30.525 --> 00:48:31.663
ASHLEY: No.

00:48:31.663 --> 00:48:32.523
SAM: Oh.

00:48:32.523 --> 00:48:36.574
(laughter)

00:48:36.574 --> 00:48:41.388
SAM: Oh. Well, because you could be.

00:48:41.388 --> 00:48:44.624
ASHLEY: I forgot my birthday. I don't know how old
I am.

00:48:44.624 --> 00:48:46.358
SAM: Is it in the hundreds?

00:48:46.358 --> 00:48:50.672
ASHLEY: No. I think it's in the 30s.

00:48:50.672 --> 00:48:53.356
SAM: Oh, okay.

00:48:53.356 --> 00:48:54.849
ASHLEY: Right?

00:48:54.849 --> 00:48:56.480
MATT: Whatever you want.

00:48:56.480 --> 00:48:58.151
ASHLEY: Yeah.

00:48:58.151 --> 00:48:59.782
LIAM: You ain't no baby.

00:48:59.782 --> 00:49:08.258
MATT: The gentleman shuffles back now with a bunch
of cups. His hands wrung through all the various

00:49:08.258 --> 00:49:10.500
handles. (grunts, clicks)

00:49:10.500 --> 00:49:13.329
LAURA: Impressive.

00:49:13.387 --> 00:49:19.926
MATT: (grunts) "Two gold for both bottles."

00:49:19.926 --> 00:49:22.099
LAURA: I give him two gold.

00:49:22.099 --> 00:49:24.216
MATT: "Thank you."

00:49:24.216 --> 00:49:25.418
LAURA: You're welcome.

00:49:25.418 --> 00:49:30.305
SAM: In my earring, I say to Vex: I'm clamming up,
you do it.

00:49:30.305 --> 00:49:31.749
LAURA: Sir?

00:49:31.749 --> 00:49:36.704
MATT: You see him walking and he goes like
(sighs).

00:49:36.704 --> 00:49:42.464
LAURA: On your way to the back, could you tell the
Many we'd like to speak to them?

00:49:42.464 --> 00:49:52.092
MATT: He slowly turns his head over to the
bartender, the woman. "What was that?"

00:49:52.092 --> 00:49:55.493
LAURA: Oh, just a conversation with the Many.

00:49:55.493 --> 00:49:58.475
MATT: "What about them?"

00:49:58.475 --> 00:50:02.775
LIAM: I dip my thumb into some wine and I use
thieves' cant and write "discuss"

00:50:02.775 --> 00:50:05.023
in wine on the bar.

00:50:05.220 --> 00:50:14.992
MATT: (click) She gives a click noise to the old
man, who goes (groan, thump) Are you going to take

00:50:15.035 --> 00:50:16.625
your bottles or what?

00:50:16.625 --> 00:50:18.295
LAURA: No, yeah, we'll definitely keep those.

00:50:18.295 --> 00:50:20.225
MATT: "All right, pick them up. Follow me."

00:50:20.225 --> 00:50:24.669
TALIESIN: Oh, we're going to get to see the real
bar.

00:50:24.669 --> 00:50:30.773
MATT: He turns around and shuffles out. It's like
following a bad, slow NPC in World of Warcraft.

00:50:30.773 --> 00:50:37.425
You're like, just go fucking faster! His pace is
terrible. Yeah, it's awful.

00:50:37.425 --> 00:50:39.383
LAURA: Running ahead, turning around.

00:50:39.383 --> 00:50:41.440
MATT: Exactly, just waiting.

00:50:41.440 --> 00:50:43.319
TRAVIS: Over here, adventurer!

00:50:43.319 --> 00:50:52.680
MATT: Eventually, he takes you out of the small
pub, past the unused kitchen, which has another

00:50:52.680 --> 00:50:58.583
series of stale bread clumps on the side, down to
what looks to be a broom closet. He gets there to

00:50:58.583 --> 00:51:01.305
the edge of the broom closet and pulls out a key
ring.

00:51:01.305 --> 00:51:04.915
LAURA: I want to pay attention to what key he's
taking.

00:51:04.915 --> 00:51:09.864
MARISHA: Can I take the bread crumbs from the
corner and throw it down

00:51:09.864 --> 00:51:11.451
so the rats could have it?

00:51:11.451 --> 00:51:15.834
MATT: Sure. So you walk over to the kitchen and
grab some of the bread crumbs and throw them down

00:51:15.834 --> 00:51:20.529
on the ground and you wait there, because there's
no rats present. And you're like, bread crumbs.

00:51:20.529 --> 00:51:27.532
They scatter a little further out. You turn around
and the minute you turn, in the air you hear

00:51:27.532 --> 00:51:32.235
(skittering) and look over, and there's like seven
rats that just scurried out of the shadows and are

00:51:32.235 --> 00:51:35.681
just going at these crumbs immediately.

00:51:35.681 --> 00:51:38.011
TRAVIS: I kill all of them.

00:51:38.011 --> 00:51:40.338
LAURA: Sploosh!

00:51:40.338 --> 00:51:49.909
LIAM: I nudge my sister and say, all mine.

00:51:49.909 --> 00:51:52.530
LAURA: Yes. That she is.

00:51:52.530 --> 00:52:00.981
MATT: He pulls one key and unlocks the small
closet. You paid attention? (creak) Opens this

00:52:00.981 --> 00:52:07.411
rickety wooden door, and goes (grunt) and walks
past, and he's behind the door, expectantly

00:52:07.411 --> 00:52:13.197
waiting. You guys glance into the space, and you
can see there's what looks to be a low torchlight

00:52:13.197 --> 00:52:18.263
about every ten feet down a wooden stairway that
descends about 30, 40 feet.

00:52:18.263 --> 00:52:25.689
LIAM: Traps, people hiding, anything that seems
out of place or dangerous.

00:52:25.689 --> 00:52:27.893
MATT: Traps, or people hiding?

00:52:27.893 --> 00:52:29.019
LIAM: Traps.

00:52:29.019 --> 00:52:30.494
LAURA: I'll look for people hiding.

00:52:30.494 --> 00:52:35.064
MATT: Perception check, investigation check.

00:52:35.064 --> 00:52:39.605
LAURA: 24.

00:52:39.605 --> 00:52:41.199
LIAM: 24.

00:52:41.199 --> 00:52:44.069
MARISHA and ASHLEY: Twinsies!

00:52:44.069 --> 00:52:52.116
MATT: Look at that. That's disgusting. All right,
so you guys make your way down. No traps in the

00:52:52.116 --> 00:52:54.942
stair descent, but you make your way to the bottom
of the stairs without issue. You don't see

00:52:54.942 --> 00:52:59.240
anything necessarily fishy. You do see these
torches have been burning for a little bit, a

00:52:59.240 --> 00:53:02.929
couple hours, and are probably needing to be
re-upped pretty soon. You guys eventually make

00:53:02.929 --> 00:53:05.574
your way down, and as soon as the last of you--
who's following up the rear in this, by the way?

00:53:05.574 --> 00:53:06.844
What's the marching order?

00:53:06.844 --> 00:53:09.368
SAM: I'll go toward the front with the twins?

00:53:09.368 --> 00:53:13.828
MATT: The hallway here is about big enough for you
to go single file.

00:53:13.828 --> 00:53:16.417
LAURA: Okay. You'll hang behind me, Tary?

00:53:16.417 --> 00:53:17.613
ASHLEY: I'm in front of Grog.

00:53:17.613 --> 00:53:19.521
MARISHA: Yeah, I'll hang with Grog and Pike.

00:53:19.521 --> 00:53:21.006
TALIESIN: I'm in the center, as well.

00:53:21.006 --> 00:53:22.369
TRAVIS: I'm in the back.

00:53:22.369 --> 00:53:25.723
MATT: Okay, so Grog's in the very back. Keyleth,
Percy.

00:53:25.723 --> 00:53:30.016
LAURA: Pike is with Grog.

00:53:30.016 --> 00:53:35.610
MATT: Yeah, Pike's with Grog. So we'll say, Grog
in the back, then Pike, then Keyleth, then Percy,

00:53:35.610 --> 00:53:37.821
then Taryon?

00:53:37.821 --> 00:53:39.064
LAURA: Yeah.

00:53:39.064 --> 00:53:45.771
MATT: And Vex and Vax. And you have Trinket in
your necklace, I assume? Okay. All right, so you

00:53:45.771 --> 00:53:51.226
guys descend down the stairway. As soon as, Grog,
you make your way in, it's tiny. You have to

00:53:51.226 --> 00:53:58.350
(straining) squeeze in and duck low and even just
walking through the pathway, your shoulders are

00:53:58.350 --> 00:54:02.042
rubbing against the sides of the wall, and your
head occasionally (bang, bang).

00:54:02.042 --> 00:54:03.852
LAURA: It's like you in Japan, baby!

00:54:03.852 --> 00:54:08.717
TRAVIS: I know. Taking a shower, I broke like two
shower heads.

00:54:08.717 --> 00:54:12.530
Just turning around, I was like (crash).

00:54:12.530 --> 00:54:17.683
LIAM: The beds, was that like lying down on a
saltine for you?

00:54:17.683 --> 00:54:20.743
TRAVIS: Oh yeah. My heels were just over like
the--

00:54:20.743 --> 00:54:25.316
LAURA: We went into McDonald's and his head hit
the ceiling!

00:54:25.316 --> 00:54:26.622
MATT: You are a kaiju!

00:54:26.622 --> 00:54:34.054
ASHLEY: A kaiju from the deep! A level seven!

00:54:34.054 --> 00:54:38.760
MARISHA: Okay, wait, before we go any further.

00:54:38.760 --> 00:54:39.976
MATT: Okay.

00:54:39.976 --> 00:54:41.879
MARISHA: Wait.

00:54:41.879 --> 00:54:48.303
TRAVIS: Oh my god. Holy shit. Before we go any
further, wait.

00:54:48.303 --> 00:54:52.267
MARISHA: Do I have to be doing a short rest to do
the Inspiring Leader thing?

00:54:52.267 --> 00:54:53.940
MATT: It's ten minutes, it takes to do.

00:54:53.940 --> 00:54:55.091
MARISHA: Oh, never mind.

00:54:55.091 --> 00:54:56.971
LAURA: Well, no, we could stand here for ten
minutes!

00:54:56.971 --> 00:54:59.876
TRAVIS: Yeah, no, please. Fucking say some words!

00:54:59.876 --> 00:55:03.475
MARISHA: I'm new to the being an inspiring leader
thing.

00:55:03.475 --> 00:55:06.832
MATT: Yeah, it's ten minutes, before you know
you're going to go into something,

00:55:06.832 --> 00:55:08.244
you stop and do this.

00:55:08.244 --> 00:55:09.781
MARISHA: I should've done that at the bar.

00:55:09.781 --> 00:55:12.036
LIAM: Wouldn't that be cool if you were just
pep-talking us all the way down here?

00:55:12.036 --> 00:55:13.143
SAM: Start it now.

00:55:13.143 --> 00:55:15.593
LAURA: Yeah, start it now! Just do it while we're
walking!

00:55:15.593 --> 00:55:21.833
MARISHA: Okay, okay. As we walk I'll be like: You
know what, guys? I've had a lot of time to think

00:55:21.888 --> 00:55:24.343
over the year that we've been away--

00:55:24.343 --> 00:55:26.921
MATT: The door closes behind Grog and you hear it
lock.

00:55:26.921 --> 00:55:38.448
MARISHA: And I feel like we've grown so much as
people, and you guys are family. You're a family

00:55:38.448 --> 00:55:47.708
to me. And I go on for a while. Do you guys
remember that time in Stillben? When we very first

00:55:47.708 --> 00:55:54.047
met, and we all didn't really like each other, and
Grog, I don't think you

00:55:54.047 --> 00:55:55.769
understood me for a while.

00:55:55.769 --> 00:55:57.228
TRAVIS: Still don't.

00:55:57.228 --> 00:56:01.233
MARISHA: Yeah, that's fine. That's fair. Hey Grog,
do you remember that one time--

00:56:01.233 --> 00:56:05.680
MATT: This is great, by the way, because at the
bottom of the stairs it only goes for about 15

00:56:05.721 --> 00:56:08.994
more feet before there's a door. There's a man on
a stool who's just sitting there going--

00:56:08.994 --> 00:56:13.283
LIAM: She'll just be another minute.

00:56:13.283 --> 00:56:17.319
TRAVIS: I'm about to find out what the inside of a
Bag of Holding feels like, I swear.

00:56:17.319 --> 00:56:22.204
MATT: He's not stopping you.

00:56:22.204 --> 00:56:31.219
MARISHA: Do you remember that time-- I think it
was the first time I made you laugh, and I turned

00:56:31.219 --> 00:56:35.104
into an earth elemental, and then pretended to do
an "I'm going down the stairs"

00:56:35.104 --> 00:56:36.873
thing through the floor?

00:56:36.873 --> 00:56:37.929
TRAVIS: Oh yeah!

00:56:37.929 --> 00:56:44.111
MARISHA: Yeah, I just remembered that the other
day, and I just love you guys so much, you know?

00:56:44.111 --> 00:56:46.345
TALIESIN: I don't feel included in this.

00:56:46.345 --> 00:56:50.543
MARISHA: Yeah, I don't think you were around yet.
But I love you so much!

00:56:50.543 --> 00:56:52.205
TALIESIN: Okay, now I feel better. That's all.

00:56:52.205 --> 00:56:54.302
SAM: Any change in our bodies or anything?

00:56:54.302 --> 00:57:01.572
LIAM: She's going for ten in-game, real-time
minutes.

00:57:01.572 --> 00:57:11.329
MATT: As you guys are all in the hallway, Grog at
the back, you can't move forward, because

00:57:11.329 --> 00:57:20.095
everyone's stopped, and you're just like-- (groan)
All of you who wish to can take 17 temporary hit

00:57:20.158 --> 00:57:22.745
points. That's by the inspiring leader feat.

00:57:22.745 --> 00:57:25.472
MARISHA: Oh yeah, you want to mock until you
realize you get your hit points!

00:57:25.472 --> 00:57:31.650
MATT: It is your choice as to whether or not you
felt inspired by that and take them.

00:57:31.650 --> 00:57:38.180
MARISHA: And I love you guys. I love you guys so
much.

00:57:38.180 --> 00:57:40.270
MATT: Grog's too uncomfortable to take them.

00:57:40.270 --> 00:57:43.177
TRAVIS: No, I just start weeping silently in the
back.

00:57:43.177 --> 00:57:45.738
LIAM: I mean, let's be honest, he wouldn't even
feel the difference.

00:57:45.738 --> 00:57:48.399
MATT: That's true, yeah. That's what Grog needs,
is temporary hit points.

00:57:48.399 --> 00:57:50.474
LIAM: Grog would just go (sneezes).

00:57:50.474 --> 00:57:53.182
MARISHA: Not showing your sensitivity?

00:57:53.182 --> 00:57:58.950
LAURA: Thanks. Thanks, Keyleth. That felt good.
That was a nice trip down memory lane.

00:57:58.950 --> 00:58:00.254
ASHLEY: I feel inspired.

00:58:00.254 --> 00:58:03.129
LAURA: Oh, hey! How's it going there?

00:58:03.129 --> 00:58:07.978
MATT: You see this guy, he's tough and surly,
looks like a balding man who's just like made of

00:58:07.978 --> 00:58:12.893
muscle and anger. He's sitting there with one eye
open, one a little squinted, he's just--

00:58:12.893 --> 00:58:15.739
LAURA: Do you feel inspired? No.

00:58:15.739 --> 00:58:17.735
LIAM: Not the warm and fuzzy type, are you?

00:58:17.735 --> 00:58:20.971
MATT: He doesn't seem to respond. You do hear like
a series of muffled voices and what sounds like a

00:58:20.971 --> 00:58:24.460
faint beat of some kind from the other side of the
wall, just muffled.

00:58:24.460 --> 00:58:31.470
TALIESIN: Is the password, "I am what I am," not
sure? Too strange a reference; never mind.

00:58:31.470 --> 00:58:35.230
MATT: He begins to reach over for what looks to be
a small lever that's hidden on the side.

00:58:35.230 --> 00:58:36.976
LAURA: We're here to speak to the Many.

00:58:36.976 --> 00:58:44.128
MATT: Stops. (grunts)

00:58:44.128 --> 00:58:49.406
SAM: We're in.

00:58:49.406 --> 00:58:51.477
LAURA: We're going to just go on in, then.

00:58:51.477 --> 00:58:53.507
SAM: That word just gets us in.

00:58:53.507 --> 00:59:05.419
MATT: So. As you guys enter this doorway, as it
pushes open, you're immediately hit with a wall of

00:59:05.419 --> 00:59:15.406
voices and laughter and conversation, interweaving
in multiple languages. This is far more lively

00:59:15.406 --> 00:59:22.036
than you expected it would be, it's a large tavern
hall. It's almost two stories tall, but it's open.

00:59:22.036 --> 00:59:26.742
There's a central, circular chandelier that hangs
over with what looks to be flickering candles in a

00:59:26.742 --> 00:59:31.471
circle around it. You can see elements of what are
almost like a second floor, but it's more like a

00:59:31.471 --> 00:59:36.531
slight balcony outcropping. You don't see any
doorways, it's just a level platform above, and

00:59:36.531 --> 00:59:40.559
there before you, you see what has to be three or
four dozen people scattered across a number of

00:59:40.559 --> 00:59:47.389
tables, all in various forms of dress and many of
them are drinking, some of them are playing games

00:59:47.389 --> 00:59:56.355
of chance, some of them are in deep conversation.
You can see, the music-- though this is a bad

00:59:56.355 --> 01:00:00.849
example, but it's what I have-- it's not a full
band, per se. It looks like there's a set of three

01:00:00.849 --> 01:00:06.125
percussionists in the far corner that are all in
the process of weaving this rhythmic beat that

01:00:06.125 --> 01:00:10.907
shifts and changes. Some of them are on more of a
hand drum, some of them are more small percussion

01:00:10.907 --> 01:00:14.791
instruments. It's interesting. It's not the usual
bar atmosphere you're used to.

01:00:14.791 --> 01:00:17.542
It has almost a weird--

01:00:17.542 --> 01:00:22.443
SAM: Would you say more like Blue Man Group or
more like a subway bucket drummer?

01:00:22.515 --> 01:00:27.457
MATT: I'd say it's in between the two, actually.
Take a little Blue Man Group and a little bit of

01:00:27.457 --> 01:00:33.126
subway bucket drummer. It's right in between
there. You guys step into the chamber and take in

01:00:33.126 --> 01:00:39.361
the atmosphere a bit. Whether that be with smiles,
awe, or confusion and care.

01:00:39.361 --> 01:00:41.643
TALIESIN: That's exactly what I said, the real
bar.

01:00:41.643 --> 01:00:43.527
ASHLEY: I like this.

01:00:43.527 --> 01:00:45.736
LIAM: This is like old times.

01:00:45.736 --> 01:00:53.208
MATT: As soon as you begin having this
conversation and taking in the atmosphere, one of

01:00:53.208 --> 01:00:58.032
four bar hands sees you approach. You see a jagged
smile of a hairless man with ruddy skin that

01:00:58.032 --> 01:01:05.058
immediately comes up to you. "Aye, friends! New
faces are few and far between here in Deastok.

01:01:05.058 --> 01:01:09.762
"Welcome to our little slice of the family. What
can I get you?"

01:01:09.762 --> 01:01:14.987
SAM: Well, we brought bottles. That's rude, isn't
it?

01:01:14.987 --> 01:01:17.119
LAURA: The good stuff is down here.

01:01:17.119 --> 01:01:19.217
MATT: "I don't know where you got that shit but
put that away.

01:01:19.217 --> 01:01:22.191
"We'll get you right fucked up, eh?"

01:01:22.191 --> 01:01:24.144
MARISHA: Do you have a shiraz?

01:01:24.144 --> 01:01:26.405
MATT: "I'll see what I can muster."

01:01:26.405 --> 01:01:29.872
MARISHA: I like these people!

01:01:29.872 --> 01:01:39.670
MATT: "Slim pickings for room here. It's a bit
early in the evening. That's when it's the

01:01:39.670 --> 01:01:44.546
"busiest. Just find some space, sit down. Folks
don't want you to sit by them?

01:01:44.546 --> 01:01:46.326
"Don't fucking sit by them."

01:01:46.326 --> 01:01:53.242
LAURA: Thank you. Do we see room for a large
group?

01:01:53.242 --> 01:01:56.680
MATT: You see two tables that have room for half
of a large group.

01:01:56.680 --> 01:01:59.098
LAURA: All right. Split up?

01:01:59.098 --> 01:02:02.520
SAM: Why don't we ask them nicely if they would
like to move?

01:02:02.520 --> 01:02:04.035
LAURA: No, let's not do that.

01:02:04.035 --> 01:02:06.523
TRAVIS: Yeah, no. You do that. Go by yourself.

01:02:06.523 --> 01:02:08.070
SAM: No?

01:02:08.070 --> 01:02:10.219
TALIESIN: No. This is special.

01:02:10.219 --> 01:02:12.583
TRAVIS: How about the talkers go to one table?

01:02:12.583 --> 01:02:17.235
MARISHA: And then the defenders go to another in
case shit goes bad. I like that.

01:02:17.235 --> 01:02:21.096
TRAVIS: The Defenders' Table. Yeah, so I'm going to
the talkers' table.

01:02:21.096 --> 01:02:23.279
LAURA: Yeah, obviously.

01:02:23.279 --> 01:02:28.950
MARISHA: Vex, Tary, I feel like you guys are good
talkers.

01:02:28.950 --> 01:02:29.988
LAURA: Right.

01:02:29.988 --> 01:02:31.753
TALIESIN: I'll join you.

01:02:31.753 --> 01:02:34.884
LIAM: I'm actually going to wander the room.

01:02:34.884 --> 01:02:38.146
MARISHA: I'll sit with Grog and Pike.

01:02:38.146 --> 01:02:39.189
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:02:39.189 --> 01:02:40.899
ASHLEY: Yeah, Shiraz time.

01:02:40.899 --> 01:02:42.584
LAURA: All right.

01:02:42.584 --> 01:02:49.735
SAM: What's our play here? Do we just keep saying
the word "many" as many times as we can and see

01:02:49.735 --> 01:02:50.692
how far it goes?

01:02:50.692 --> 01:02:53.713
LAURA: This is about as in as we get with the
Many.

01:02:53.713 --> 01:02:57.554
SAM: This is it? So now we ask for her by name? Or
him by name? Korshad?

01:02:57.554 --> 01:03:03.091
LAURA: Yeah. He or she may not reveal themselves
too quickly.

01:03:03.091 --> 01:03:04.298
SAM: All right.

01:03:04.298 --> 01:03:06.116
TALIESIN: We could buy Korshad a drink.

01:03:06.116 --> 01:03:07.907
LAURA: That is a beautiful idea.

01:03:07.907 --> 01:03:09.277
TALIESIN: Thank you.

01:03:09.277 --> 01:03:12.187
LAURA: Care of one Taryon Darrington.

01:03:12.187 --> 01:03:15.567
SAM: Of course. I have just enough for a nice
drink.

01:03:15.567 --> 01:03:22.086
LAURA: Oh, we'll cover the drink, darling. Party
funds cover the drink. It's just in your name.

01:03:22.086 --> 01:03:25.937
SAM: Oh. Oh, okay. All right. All right. I'm slow
to catch on sometimes.

01:03:25.937 --> 01:03:29.368
LAURA: Can we grab a barmaid?

01:03:29.368 --> 01:03:42.517
MATT: You split between the two tables. One of the
tables appears to be three guys who are in a card

01:03:42.517 --> 01:03:48.240
game. As soon as you sit down they (grunts) and
then keep talking amongst themselves more about

01:03:48.240 --> 01:03:53.442
taking bets, bluffing each other, giving shit
about their home lives, stuff like that. The other

01:03:53.442 --> 01:04:02.868
table has four quiet individuals that are, look to
be elvish lineage. Either half-elf or full elf;

01:04:02.868 --> 01:04:08.594
it's hard to tell. They're wearing these hoods
that show the ears from underneath but then seem

01:04:08.594 --> 01:04:12.625
to block a lot of the features of their face and
guard a lot of the forehead. This silk hood that

01:04:12.625 --> 01:04:15.451
drips down past the nose on the sides.

01:04:15.451 --> 01:04:20.311
LAURA: Do we recognize any semblance of that
garb?

01:04:20.311 --> 01:04:22.215
MATT: Make a history check.

01:04:22.215 --> 01:04:24.307
SAM: History check.

01:04:24.307 --> 01:04:30.639
LAURA: Well, my history is shit, but 19.

01:04:30.639 --> 01:04:45.245
MATT: 19. You haven't seen this kind of dress, but
you've heard of it. It seems to be of Wildmount

01:04:45.245 --> 01:04:52.018
but the eastern side of Wildmount, not a part of
the Dwendalian Empire. This more stems from

01:04:52.018 --> 01:05:00.978
Zorhaus, which is the other kingdom on the
continent. It's actually in a tense existence

01:05:00.978 --> 01:05:03.939
along the border of the Dwendalian Empire.

01:05:03.939 --> 01:05:07.438
LAURA: You said it was to the east?

01:05:07.438 --> 01:05:09.269
MATT: Zorhaus, I'm pretty sure that's what it's
called.

01:05:09.269 --> 01:05:11.190
LAURA: It is now.

01:05:11.190 --> 01:05:14.711
MATT: It is! It's whatever it's called in the
campaign guide.

01:05:14.711 --> 01:05:19.507
LAURA: Oh! Oh man, that's right. Now you have to
stick to what you wrote. That's crazy.

01:05:19.507 --> 01:05:26.131
MATT: I know, I'll just have to look it up again.
But anyway. As soon as you sit down at the table

01:05:26.131 --> 01:05:32.209
the four individuals look at each other and then
get up from the table and then walk off to find

01:05:32.209 --> 01:05:33.594
another place.

01:05:33.594 --> 01:05:41.486
LAURA: Maybe some of us don't smell very good in
this group. I'm not one of them, though.

01:05:41.486 --> 01:05:42.837
I smell amazing.

01:05:42.837 --> 01:05:48.425
LIAM: I smell fucking fantastic, and I'm over
there. I am going to laze about the musicians and

01:05:48.425 --> 01:05:51.838
listen to the musicians and wait for them to
finish a set.

01:05:51.838 --> 01:05:52.913
MATT: Okay.

01:05:52.913 --> 01:05:56.769
LAURA: I guess all of us can sit at the table
because of the people--

01:05:56.769 --> 01:06:02.918
MATT: All of you guys can sit at the table now
that you've forced them off their own space. The

01:06:02.918 --> 01:06:09.125
guys playing the card game seemed to pay no mind.
As you sit around the table, the barhand that met

01:06:09.246 --> 01:06:14.555
you here approaches and once more goes, "All
right, looks like you've found a place to sit,

01:06:14.555 --> 01:06:20.257
"what can I get you? Got you that shiraz you were
asking for, eh." He goes ahead and he pulls up

01:06:20.257 --> 01:06:28.036
what looks to be a dark green bottle, already uncorked
and he brings over a hefty metallic goblet or

01:06:28.234 --> 01:06:36.977
tankard and then pours it in there. It appears to
be something akin to a shiraz, I suppose. Fills it

01:06:36.977 --> 01:06:42.977
to the top, slides it forward. "All right. Drinks
for anyone else, eh?"

01:06:42.977 --> 01:06:47.779
TRAVIS: Yeah, you got any pies or meat or both?

01:06:47.779 --> 01:06:49.454
TALIESIN: To drink.

01:06:49.454 --> 01:06:52.857
TRAVIS: Do they not have food?

01:06:52.857 --> 01:06:54.427
LAURA: No, probably.

01:06:54.427 --> 01:06:57.930
MATT: "I can get you a meat pie, if that's what
you're asking. I don't recommend you drink it,

01:06:57.930 --> 01:07:01.937
"though you could probably squeeze water from a
stone, so wouldn't surprise me if you could."

01:07:01.937 --> 01:07:04.113
TRAVIS: Yeah, meat pie and an ale, please.

01:07:04.113 --> 01:07:07.103
MATT: "All right, coming on up. Anyone else?"

01:07:07.103 --> 01:07:08.358
LAURA: Whiskey?

01:07:08.358 --> 01:07:09.892
TALIESIN: Same.

01:07:09.892 --> 01:07:13.224
MATT: "It can be done. So whiskey. And you, little
one?"

01:07:13.224 --> 01:07:18.216
ASHLEY: Well, you said you have things that will
fuck you up right,

01:07:18.216 --> 01:07:20.477
so what would that be considered?

01:07:20.477 --> 01:07:26.199
MATT: "Oh, I mean no offense, lady, but you're a
bit small-sized--"

01:07:26.199 --> 01:07:28.623
ALL: Whoa!

01:07:28.623 --> 01:07:35.022
MATT: "I mean that respectfully! Look, I'm just
looking out for my patrons here. I don't want to

01:07:35.022 --> 01:07:38.929
"go ahead and send someone to the local temple."

01:07:38.929 --> 01:07:41.684
LAURA: She can drink most people under the table.

01:07:41.684 --> 01:07:42.951
ASHLEY: Bring it!

01:07:42.951 --> 01:07:45.580
MATT: "All right. I'll take your word for it,
then."

01:07:45.580 --> 01:07:47.979
SAM: I'll have another shiraz.

01:07:47.979 --> 01:07:49.863
MATT: "Another shiraz."

01:07:49.863 --> 01:07:54.161
LIAM: Over the earring: Pickle, will you get me
one of those, as well, and don't drink it before I

01:07:54.161 --> 01:07:55.211
come back?

01:07:55.211 --> 01:07:57.926
ASHLEY: As a matter of fact, I want two of
whatever that is.

01:07:57.926 --> 01:08:03.824
MATT: "All right, coming up." And he leaves the
table.

01:08:03.824 --> 01:08:08.825
TALIESIN: Did you order the drink for when he
comes back?

01:08:08.825 --> 01:08:17.822
SAM: Oh the other drink? Oh fuck. Wait, before he
goes, pardon me. I have one more order to make. I

01:08:17.822 --> 01:08:27.071
would like to buy a drink for Korshad, courtesy of
Taryon Darrington.

01:08:27.071 --> 01:08:30.390
And I'll slip him a gold piece.

01:08:30.390 --> 01:08:33.024
TRAVIS: I thought you were about to shake his hand
with two fingers.

01:08:33.024 --> 01:08:38.085
SAM: There is a coin between the two fingers.

01:08:38.085 --> 01:08:42.089
MATT: "Korshad, you say?"

01:08:42.089 --> 01:08:43.690
SAM: Yes.

01:08:43.690 --> 01:08:44.905
MATT: "All right."

01:08:44.905 --> 01:08:47.622
LAURA: I nudge him under the table.

01:08:47.622 --> 01:08:49.899
MATT: "You want what he likes, it's going to cost
you more than that."

01:08:49.899 --> 01:08:51.624
LAURA: What does he like?

01:08:51.624 --> 01:08:59.480
SAM: Whatever it is, here is another four and keep
another one for yourself.

01:08:59.480 --> 01:09:06.001
MATT: "Thank you very much. That'll put you up to
yours, though. We will go ahead and settle your

01:09:06.001 --> 01:09:12.541
"bills at the end of the drinks. But all right,
Korshad it is."

01:09:12.541 --> 01:09:17.248
TALIESIN: What table did the bartender look at
when he said that?

01:09:17.248 --> 01:09:19.170
MATT: Make a perception check.

01:09:19.170 --> 01:09:22.322
LAURA: Oh, I was planning on totally watching
that, too.

01:09:22.322 --> 01:09:26.369
TALIESIN: Yeah, that's a safe 13.

01:09:26.369 --> 01:09:28.303
LAURA: Should I roll, too?

01:09:28.303 --> 01:09:31.603
MATT: Well, you said you were looking, too, so
roll a perception, yeah.

01:09:31.603 --> 01:09:37.963
LAURA: Well yeah, okay. 30.

01:09:37.963 --> 01:09:47.676
MATT: 30, okay. You gather the direction that he
glanced. It was a cursory look, more to see if the

01:09:47.733 --> 01:09:54.327
individual in question was still in the room or
not. But you got the direction of it, and you know

01:09:54.327 --> 01:10:02.026
exactly where he was looking-- three tables and
that way there. He leaves for a bit, and the

01:10:02.026 --> 01:10:10.041
laughter is still rising and falling throughout
the room. The musicians in the corner, which are

01:10:10.041 --> 01:10:17.433
two younger human boys and what appears to be a
female goliath, who has the heavier drum in the

01:10:17.433 --> 01:10:25.333
center, who is like the mid-piece, the big (heavy
drum noises). The two guys, one of them has a

01:10:25.333 --> 01:10:32.165
small set of lap drums, (light drum noises) the
faster beats. And the guy to the left of her--

01:10:32.165 --> 01:10:37.479
they could be brothers; you're not too sure, their
features are similar but different enough, the

01:10:37.522 --> 01:10:43.982
ages seem off. The guy on the left has a series of
small wooden blocks and what looks to be some sort

01:10:43.982 --> 01:10:48.062
of contraption that has three or four different
small percussion instruments that are all fixed to

01:10:48.062 --> 01:10:52.873
it and so he is leaping between them all. For
being just percussion, that variety is still

01:10:52.873 --> 01:10:58.447
making a cool melody. You're still able to find
certain notes and certain blends where it still is

01:10:58.447 --> 01:11:03.875
a very different and unique atmosphere. They
manage to bring to this crescendo the piece that

01:11:03.875 --> 01:11:08.627
you entered on, and it finishes. There is no
real-- there is occasionally a couple of claps here

01:11:08.627 --> 01:11:10.519
and most everyone is busy about their own shit.

01:11:10.567 --> 01:11:13.482
LIAM: All right, I clap. Excuse me, players?

01:11:13.482 --> 01:11:18.824
MATT: As they're both looking over to grab a drink
to stop and the younger guy with a scruffy chin

01:11:18.824 --> 01:11:23.058
and this mop of hair that's a little wild glances
over to you: "Yeah?"

01:11:23.058 --> 01:11:28.499
LIAM: That was a really unique piece you guys just
did there. Thank you.

01:11:28.499 --> 01:11:30.939
MATT: "You're welcome."

01:11:30.939 --> 01:11:37.547
LIAM: You know, I have only ever heard music like
that one time, and it wasn't here. It wasn't in

01:11:37.547 --> 01:11:46.830
this city, it was actually in Emon. What was his
name? Dranzel. It was a musician named Dranzel--

01:11:46.830 --> 01:11:54.134
this is a long shot, but you haven't come across a
Dr. Dranzel in your travels? I've always wanted to

01:11:54.134 --> 01:11:55.456
hear him play again.

01:11:55.456 --> 01:11:57.951
MATT: "Can't say I have, sir. My apologies."

01:11:58.026 --> 01:11:59.318
LIAM: Oh, shit.

01:11:59.318 --> 01:12:06.637
MATT: "Sorry. You guys ever heard of Dr. Dranzel?"
And the other guy goes, "Nope."

01:12:06.637 --> 01:12:08.627
LIAM: Orcish. Stylish hats.

01:12:08.627 --> 01:12:14.488
MATT: The goliath woman is sitting there and she is
just staring off across the room and goes, "No."

01:12:14.488 --> 01:12:18.505
(laughter)

01:12:18.505 --> 01:12:20.564
MATT: "Sorry, friend."

01:12:20.564 --> 01:12:26.691
LAURA: I'm keeping an eye on the side of the room
that he glanced in, looking for anybody going and

01:12:26.691 --> 01:12:28.515
delivering drinks to the people.

01:12:28.515 --> 01:12:33.768
MATT: Okay. You watch the gentleman who has been
getting you guys drinks, and he is in the process

01:12:33.768 --> 01:12:41.584
of getting all of your various drink orders and
pouring what you have requested, and he does come

01:12:41.584 --> 01:12:49.142
to a point where he gets this one fine jewel
goblet that he has specifically set off to the

01:12:49.142 --> 01:12:54.981
side and he takes it and washes it and takes care
to clean it entirely and dry it off, and once it's

01:12:54.981 --> 01:12:59.577
set there he reaches underneath, counting a few
bottles and pulls one drink, uncorks it and there

01:12:59.577 --> 01:13:07.457
is this thick dark brown glass jug and as he
uncorks it he pours it into there, glances over,

01:13:07.457 --> 01:13:11.513
grabs another thing, seems to be mixing it with
something else. He is being very careful with the

01:13:11.513 --> 01:13:19.124
actual amounts he is pouring. He finishes that,
takes a piece of what looks like an orange,

01:13:19.124 --> 01:13:28.999
crushes it in the inside and leaves the rind and
takes it and swishes it for a second. (sighs) And

01:13:29.056 --> 01:13:34.637
walks over to a table across the entire hall,
where you saw him glance before.

01:13:34.682 --> 01:13:36.807
SAM: One sex on the beach!

01:13:36.807 --> 01:13:40.090
(laughter)

01:13:40.090 --> 01:13:49.142
MATT: He walks over to a table where you see what
appear to be about five different patrons at the

01:13:49.142 --> 01:13:57.164
table. Most of them wealthily dressed. Two of them
appear to be older mercantile or business owners,

01:13:57.164 --> 01:14:03.410
they wear the jewelry on their hands very
extravagantly and displaying both wealth and

01:14:03.410 --> 01:14:14.509
prestige to an ostentatious way that you know most
high-end guild workers or owners tend to display.

01:14:14.509 --> 01:14:17.994
You are very familiar with caste systems that have
emerged in a lot of these central metropolitan

01:14:17.994 --> 01:14:25.539
areas, and so you can very easily pick up some of
those themes. Two of them appear as a contrast

01:14:25.539 --> 01:14:31.462
very simply dressed. No jewelry. You can't make
out any details in this distance and there is one

01:14:31.462 --> 01:14:36.553
man who he hands the drink to, he sets it down in
front of him and slides it forward. The man you

01:14:36.553 --> 01:14:42.121
see there, he has deep brown skin, marked, there
appear to be a number of tattoos that curl up his

01:14:42.121 --> 01:14:49.111
arms and up the side of his neck and touch his ears
on each side. He's wearing light, billowing

01:14:49.111 --> 01:14:56.817
clothes of silver and maroon silks that end about
the elbow and are just hanging beneath, leaving

01:14:56.817 --> 01:15:01.123
the rest of his arm completely visible where you
can see the tattoo continues up the forearm and

01:15:01.123 --> 01:15:06.871
grasps the back of the hand, almost like he has a
gauntlet on that is just his skin. You see around

01:15:06.871 --> 01:15:14.188
him a series of gold and silver bracelets and
rings that adorn his fingers. His face is framed

01:15:14.188 --> 01:15:22.730
by a lion's mane of black and gray dreadlocked
hair. Because of your perception check, at this

01:15:22.730 --> 01:15:27.898
distance and your ranger-like eyes, you can see
what you perceive to be a visible scar on his

01:15:27.898 --> 01:15:34.562
throat from ear to ear. He's currently
mid-conversation with the patrons at the table,

01:15:34.562 --> 01:15:40.340
leaned back in his chair in a comfortable setting
and as soon as the drink-- huh?

01:15:40.340 --> 01:15:42.406
LAURA: Can I read his lips?

01:15:42.406 --> 01:15:49.857
MATT: Sure. Well, the drink arrives and gets
pushed forward and you read the barkeep's lips as

01:15:49.857 --> 01:15:58.674
he says, "This drink is a gift to you from patrons
on the other side of the place." And this

01:15:58.674 --> 01:16:04.610
individual, who you assume at this point is
probably Korshad, gives a look and goes, (grunts).

01:16:04.610 --> 01:16:10.409
And he points over, right over to your table
across the room. You watch as Korshad

01:16:10.451 --> 01:16:22.768
sits up, glances over your direction, sees you
looking at him directly. Takes the drink, scoots

01:16:22.768 --> 01:16:27.710
it over next to his side, and folds his fingers
and goes back into listening to the conversation

01:16:27.710 --> 01:16:35.501
of the other patrons. And the barkeep who is
standing there is, "Right." And then goes back to

01:16:35.501 --> 01:16:40.540
the bar, gathers the rest of your drinks and
brings them slowly over to your table and passes

01:16:40.540 --> 01:16:46.777
them out. "All right, got a second shiraz, for you
there, sir. We've got a whiskey, and a whiskey. We

01:16:46.777 --> 01:16:54.771
"got an ale and a meat pie for you. And you,
well--" (laughs) He brings up these two mugs.

01:16:54.771 --> 01:17:00.204
They're simple ceramic mugs that are dark and
handcrafted, and he sloshes them up to you and as

01:17:00.204 --> 01:17:07.048
you see inside, most ale has a good liquidy
content. This has a very syrupy thick texture to

01:17:07.048 --> 01:17:12.827
it. He slides both forward and goes, "I don't
expect you to drink both those back to back."

01:17:12.827 --> 01:17:22.257
ASHLEY: Well, that's not up for you to decide, my
friend. I get on my earring. Hey, String Bean,

01:17:22.257 --> 01:17:23.960
your drink is here.

01:17:23.960 --> 01:17:31.928
LIAM: Yeah, and Sarenrae will know if you drink it
before I get back, so just hold onto it for me.

01:17:31.928 --> 01:17:34.122
ASHLEY: Well, I can't make any promises.

01:17:34.122 --> 01:17:38.389
MATT: And he leans forward and goes, "This here is
the Change-Bringer's Nectar.

01:17:38.389 --> 01:17:40.456
"You sip this, slowly."

01:17:40.456 --> 01:17:42.964
LAURA: The Change-Bringer's Nectar?

01:17:42.964 --> 01:17:52.526
MARISHA: Write that shit down. Can Keyleth get up
and walk past the diplomats' table

01:17:52.526 --> 01:17:54.989
and run my hands--

01:17:54.989 --> 01:17:56.875
MATT: Well, you guys are all at the same table
now.

01:17:56.875 --> 01:17:58.099
MARISHA: Oh, we're at the same table now?

01:17:58.099 --> 01:18:00.321
MATT: Yeah, one table got up as soon as you sat
down.

01:18:00.321 --> 01:18:08.645
MARISHA: Oh, so we scootched together? Okay, then
I'm just going to lean into Vex and give her an

01:18:08.645 --> 01:18:10.850
Enhance Ability on her charisma.

01:18:10.850 --> 01:18:13.953
LAURA: Ooh! I'll take that.

01:18:13.953 --> 01:18:15.550
MATT: Okay.

01:18:15.550 --> 01:18:19.350
MARISHA: You get advantage--

01:18:19.350 --> 01:18:21.054
LAURA: On charisma checks?

01:18:21.054 --> 01:18:22.767
MARISHA: Yeah. On checks.

01:18:22.767 --> 01:18:27.890
LAURA: I like it.

01:18:27.890 --> 01:18:30.750
MARISHA: Her cleavage gets a little nicer.

01:18:30.750 --> 01:18:33.716
LAURA: It can't get any nicer than it already is.

01:18:33.716 --> 01:18:35.193
TALIESIN: Very fair.

01:18:35.193 --> 01:18:37.348
LIAM: All said out loud.

01:18:37.348 --> 01:18:46.323
TALIESIN: Pike, which one of those two is Vax's?
Which one of those two belongs to Vax?

01:18:46.323 --> 01:18:47.480
ASHLEY: This one.

01:18:47.480 --> 01:18:49.521
TALIESIN: Oh that one? I'm taking a sip of it.

01:18:49.521 --> 01:18:51.499
ASHLEY: Take a sip. It's very thick.

01:18:51.499 --> 01:18:59.440
MATT: It's very thick, and it's sweeter than you
expected, but it has a definite burn that grows

01:18:59.440 --> 01:19:09.444
and grows after drinking it. It's syrupy, but
because of its syrupy texture, as it goes down it

01:19:09.444 --> 01:19:13.072
also coats and numbs everything as it touches.

01:19:13.072 --> 01:19:15.615
LIAM: Percy, I saw that. You have to buy me a
whole other drink.

01:19:15.615 --> 01:19:20.432
TALIESIN: That's fine. I put my whiskey in its
place and take the whole cup.

01:19:20.432 --> 01:19:27.111
LIAM: No motherfucker, that's not what I said! I
want to drink that one and the one after it! Oh,

01:19:27.111 --> 01:19:30.365
you don't want to start with me, Fredrickstein.

01:19:30.365 --> 01:19:32.904
TRAVIS: Are you sipping it?

01:19:32.904 --> 01:19:39.710
ASHLEY: I'm sipping it. I'm doing as the locals
do. Enjoying it how he told me.

01:19:39.710 --> 01:19:42.449
MATT: And you get the sense it's probably a good
thing.

01:19:42.449 --> 01:19:44.578
ASHLEY: It burns!

01:19:44.578 --> 01:19:53.101
MATT: It's almost like maple syrup Everclear.

01:19:53.101 --> 01:19:54.719
ASHLEY: Ugh!

01:19:54.719 --> 01:19:56.204
LAURA: Gross!

01:19:56.204 --> 01:19:59.927
TRAVIS: How's my meat pie?

01:19:59.927 --> 01:20:01.539
MATT: Meat pie's pretty good!

01:20:01.539 --> 01:20:03.150
TRAVIS: This is pretty good!

01:20:03.150 --> 01:20:06.880
LAURA: That makes me want an empanada right now.

01:20:06.880 --> 01:20:09.400
LIAM: Role-playing, guys.

01:20:09.400 --> 01:20:13.634
MATT: Sadly, no empanadas in Deastok.

01:20:13.634 --> 01:20:19.985
SAM: Why isn't he coming over here? Should we send
another drink? Maybe two this time.

01:20:19.985 --> 01:20:21.636
LAURA: He's in the middle of a conversation right
now.

01:20:21.636 --> 01:20:23.053
TALIESIN: He has to sit and enjoy his drink.

01:20:23.053 --> 01:20:24.398
LAURA: Let him take some time.

01:20:24.398 --> 01:20:28.605
ASHLEY: (slurring words) Should we sent him a
Change-Bringer's Nectar? Oh no!

01:20:28.605 --> 01:20:32.071
LAURA: Oh no, Pike!

01:20:32.071 --> 01:20:36.399
ASHLEY: (still slurring) I only had like three
drinks. Three sips.

01:20:36.399 --> 01:20:37.976
TRAVIS: Keep going.

01:20:37.976 --> 01:20:41.105
LAURA: Just tiny sips.

01:20:41.105 --> 01:20:43.266
ASHLEY: They were so small.

01:20:43.266 --> 01:20:45.625
LAURA: Drink some, maybe some water, too, in
between each sip.

01:20:45.625 --> 01:20:48.441
ASHLEY: Okay. Maybe some meat pie.

01:20:48.441 --> 01:20:50.802
TALIESIN: That's whiskey. That's supposed to be--
never mind. Go ahead.

01:20:50.802 --> 01:20:58.606
MARISHA: Hey, who's the Change-Bringer? Does
anyone know? I feel like this drink is inspired.

01:20:58.606 --> 01:21:02.057
Can I do a check to see?

01:21:02.057 --> 01:21:03.288
MATT: Make a religion check.

01:21:03.288 --> 01:21:06.902
MARISHA: Aw, I'm not good at this. Pike, you know
gods!

01:21:06.902 --> 01:21:11.611
ASHLEY: Let me see if I know. Will I know the
Change-Bringer?

01:21:11.611 --> 01:21:17.384
MARISHA: Oh, please. I have no idea. I definitely
have zero idea.

01:21:17.384 --> 01:21:26.424
ASHLEY: I'm going to see if I can think of it.
14.

01:21:26.424 --> 01:21:32.013
MATT: It's really not that hard. The
Change-Bringer is Avandra. Avandra, one of the

01:21:32.013 --> 01:21:33.227
gods of the pantheon.

01:21:33.227 --> 01:21:35.520
MARISHA: Oh. Yeah, of course we knew that.

01:21:35.520 --> 01:21:47.618
MATT: The Change-Bringer is the deity that looks
over luck, looks over adventure, travel, the open

01:21:47.618 --> 01:21:56.759
road. That's as much as you can glean from your
passing knowledge of the deity. Since you are not

01:21:56.759 --> 01:22:00.742
a woman of faith, obviously, you don't know
much beyond that.

01:22:00.742 --> 01:22:02.450
MARISHA: It just sounded fancy.

01:22:02.450 --> 01:22:04.223
ASHLEY: It sounded so fancy.

01:22:04.223 --> 01:22:11.875
MATT: She's also known as "she who makes the
path."

01:22:11.875 --> 01:22:14.933
LAURA: Hey, Tary.

01:22:14.933 --> 01:22:17.209
SAM: Yes? Is it time? Should I go over there?

01:22:17.209 --> 01:22:20.815
LAURA: Just calm down. This is mainly what I'm
trying to tell you right now.

01:22:20.815 --> 01:22:22.561
Stop being so weird.

01:22:22.561 --> 01:22:24.938
ASHLEY: Do you want a sip of Change-Bringer's
Nectar?

01:22:24.938 --> 01:22:26.785
LAURA: It might actually help you just a little
bit.

01:22:26.785 --> 01:22:31.525
TALIESIN: Do what we do any time there's trouble.
Sit down, pay attention,

01:22:31.525 --> 01:22:33.041
and do everything she says.

01:22:33.041 --> 01:22:37.044
LAURA: And don't look sneaky.

01:22:37.044 --> 01:22:39.803
TALIESIN: Have a sip of this. It'll help.

01:22:39.803 --> 01:22:42.863
LAURA: Yeah, seriously. Just have a little sip. A
little sip,

01:22:42.863 --> 01:22:45.129
it's always good to relax your nerves.

01:22:45.129 --> 01:22:46.236
SAM: All right.

01:22:46.236 --> 01:22:47.441
ASHLEY: Loosey-goosey.

01:22:47.441 --> 01:22:49.754
SAM: I'll take my helm and cock it to the side.

01:22:49.754 --> 01:22:53.286
LAURA: Yeah, jauntily. That's good, yeah.

01:22:53.286 --> 01:22:55.830
TALIESIN: Okay, now I feel like I'm on a
listing ship.

01:22:55.872 --> 01:23:04.841
TRAVIS: What's your confident face look like? More
tongue. Little further. Yep. Little higher eyebrow

01:23:04.924 --> 01:23:06.332
on the right side.

01:23:06.332 --> 01:23:09.625
LAURA: Okay, maybe stop. I'm just afraid he's
going to look over here at any moment. I'm keeping

01:23:09.625 --> 01:23:18.462
an eye on good old Korshad, and seeing if he looks
over here. I also want to see if I can catch his

01:23:18.462 --> 01:23:22.148
lips and see what he's talking about over on the
side there.

01:23:22.148 --> 01:23:26.886
LIAM: And I would like to look around the room and
make sure that other people aren't watching us, or

01:23:26.886 --> 01:23:29.477
if so, where in the bar they are.

01:23:29.477 --> 01:23:30.751
MATT: Make a perception check.

01:23:30.751 --> 01:23:33.142
TRAVIS: And I would like to make my way over to
the goliath woman.

01:23:33.142 --> 01:23:42.692
MATT: Okay. So as you begin walking in that
direction, Vex. Couple things. One, you notice

01:23:42.736 --> 01:23:47.660
that Korshad, while he seems to be mostly being
talked at or at least just listening to a

01:23:47.660 --> 01:23:51.064
conversation, when he does speak, he leans in and
does this.

01:23:51.064 --> 01:23:52.774
LAURA: Of course he fucking does.

01:23:52.774 --> 01:23:59.042
MATT: You get the sense he's a very guarded man
and this is not his first rodeo. He speaks through

01:23:59.042 --> 01:24:00.149
his fingers.

01:24:00.149 --> 01:24:03.164
LAURA: I do, too!

01:24:03.164 --> 01:24:10.334
MATT: But he doesn't appear to look over at your
table again. He seems to have acknowledged the

01:24:10.334 --> 01:24:16.260
drink, is enjoying it slowly, and is back
enthralled by the conversation at his table. What

01:24:16.260 --> 01:24:17.446
did you roll?

01:24:17.446 --> 01:24:18.231
LIAM: 25.

01:24:18.231 --> 01:24:20.281
MATT: 25. And what did you say you were going to
do?

01:24:20.281 --> 01:24:21.431
MARISHA: Mimic Vex.

01:24:21.431 --> 01:24:24.098
MATT: Okay. You both cover your mouths.

01:24:24.098 --> 01:24:25.493
LAURA: What are you doing?

01:24:25.493 --> 01:24:26.886
MARISHA: I'm following your lead.

01:24:26.886 --> 01:24:28.947
LAURA: You don't have to do that.

01:24:28.947 --> 01:24:32.892
TALIESIN: Does this one still work? We can do this
one.

01:24:32.892 --> 01:24:34.548
LAURA: Yeah, that one's good. Just this.

01:24:34.548 --> 01:24:36.357
ASHLEY: Is this good?

01:24:36.357 --> 01:24:44.431
LAURA: That's it, Pike. Pike's got it. He's
definitely going to come over and talk to us now,

01:24:44.431 --> 01:24:46.668
I can feel it. We're so cool.

01:24:46.668 --> 01:24:50.397
TALIESIN: This is a lot of drink that I seem to
have taken on.

01:24:50.397 --> 01:24:57.943
MATT: Vax. Glancing about the chamber, remember I
said there was a secondary platform, that didn't

01:24:57.943 --> 01:25:02.834
have any doorways to rooms, but there was just the
upper walkway across the room both ways? There are

01:25:02.834 --> 01:25:05.970
about six figures on each one.

01:25:05.970 --> 01:25:07.443
LIAM: Six on each one?

01:25:07.443 --> 01:25:15.241
MATT: They're all sitting there, wearing leather
armor, mostly covered by a cloak. You glance up

01:25:15.241 --> 01:25:19.150
and you can see underneath at least two of the
cloaks what appear to be the shape or outline of a

01:25:19.150 --> 01:25:21.197
crossbow at the ready.

01:25:21.197 --> 01:25:24.576
TALIESIN: 12 of them? 12 men?

01:25:24.576 --> 01:25:36.728
LIAM: I relay to the group quietly, yes. Packing.
12 or so above us all, so no sudden movements.

01:25:36.728 --> 01:25:42.230
MATT: The music picks up again, Grog, as you're
walking over. The next piece is occurring and you

01:25:42.230 --> 01:25:48.351
can see now that while the previous one had a
frenetic tribal beat, this one has more of a

01:25:48.351 --> 01:25:55.708
scattered, if I could say percussion jazz sense.
It tends to have multiple changes. Yeah, if you

01:25:55.708 --> 01:26:05.293
could. If you haven't heard the jazz timpani
before, it's fantastic. It's more of an

01:26:05.293 --> 01:26:08.033
improvisational piece. You can see where they're
each building off of each other, and then one will

01:26:08.033 --> 01:26:11.957
make a change and the others will shift with it.
You don't notice this, because you really don't

01:26:11.957 --> 01:26:18.385
care, but anybody who had musical interests would
be able to pick up on this. But you walk up and

01:26:18.385 --> 01:26:26.548
you see the goliath woman. Most of the goliath
women you've come across, their lifestyle leads to

01:26:26.548 --> 01:26:37.314
either very short-kept or very tightly bound hair,
as the coarse hair of the goliaths tends to mat up

01:26:37.314 --> 01:26:43.615
very thickly when living in the wild as your tribe
did. This goliath female's hair is really well

01:26:43.615 --> 01:26:52.444
kept, actually. It's almost shining, which catches
you off guard entirely. She's not tattooed and

01:26:52.444 --> 01:26:58.070
appears to be in a trance as she's in the process
of drumming away, not even looking at the two of

01:26:58.070 --> 01:27:02.102
her compatriots or any patron. She's spacing out
and is currently enraptured

01:27:02.102 --> 01:27:03.817
by the music she's creating.

01:27:03.817 --> 01:27:07.141
TRAVIS: Are there any weapons around her feet or
where she's sitting or playing?

01:27:07.141 --> 01:27:10.698
MATT: Make a perception check.

01:27:10.698 --> 01:27:12.185
TRAVIS: Three.

01:27:12.185 --> 01:27:18.826
MATT: She has very nice boots. And as a man who
has made boots in the past, you can acknowledge,

01:27:18.826 --> 01:27:20.994
those are very well-made boots.

01:27:20.994 --> 01:27:23.817
TRAVIS: Me Grog!

01:27:23.817 --> 01:27:33.596
LIAM: I just love the alacrity that Travis goes to
two, three. It's so good.

01:27:33.596 --> 01:27:37.036
TRAVIS: You play good!

01:27:37.036 --> 01:27:42.579
MATT: The head slowly turns and the eyes focus for
a second in the dim, snow-blind looking pupils,

01:27:42.579 --> 01:27:44.356
and gives you a nod.

01:27:44.356 --> 01:27:47.877
TRAVIS: Nice hair.

01:27:47.877 --> 01:27:50.969
MATT: Head turns a little to the side.

01:27:50.969 --> 01:27:58.235
TRAVIS: I'll be-- if you--

01:27:58.235 --> 01:28:01.233
ASHLEY: Tell her she has nice boots, Grog.

01:28:01.233 --> 01:28:02.269
TRAVIS: What?

01:28:02.269 --> 01:28:04.781
ASHLEY: Tell her she has nice boots.

01:28:04.781 --> 01:28:05.974
TRAVIS: Nice boobs!

01:28:05.974 --> 01:28:14.043
MATT: (bang) Big drum hit, and her part of the
song comes to a halt. The two other bits of music

01:28:14.043 --> 01:28:18.039
alter but continue the beats, and she just--

01:28:18.039 --> 01:28:32.984
TRAVIS: Boots. Nice boots. Bidet. And I go back to
the group.

01:28:32.984 --> 01:28:39.455
MATT: As you walk back to the group, a little
dejected, Vax, since you're the one who's paying

01:28:39.455 --> 01:28:43.195
attention the most at this point, you notice as
the goliath gets this small grin on the side of

01:28:43.195 --> 01:28:46.180
her face and continues to go back to the drums.

01:28:46.180 --> 01:28:48.203
LAURA: You charmed her!

01:28:48.203 --> 01:28:49.662
MARISHA: Look at you!

01:28:49.662 --> 01:28:52.153
LIAM: Nice work, de Bergerac!

01:28:52.153 --> 01:28:54.969
MATT: But Grog doesn't see it.

01:28:54.969 --> 01:28:57.459
ASHLEY: I'll be your Cyrano!

01:28:57.459 --> 01:29:02.675
MATT: All right. So what's the next order of
business, guys?

01:29:02.675 --> 01:29:05.467
TALIESIN: Is that conversation breaking up?

01:29:05.467 --> 01:29:10.138
LAURA: That's what I planned on doing, is waiting
out that conversation. I in no way want to

01:29:10.138 --> 01:29:11.263
interrupt it.

01:29:11.263 --> 01:29:17.188
MATT: About 20 additional minutes go by. Another
round is bought at the table, with Korshad still

01:29:17.188 --> 01:29:22.492
slowly, very carefully sipping the drink that you
guys bought for him. Doesn't appear to be slowing,

01:29:22.492 --> 01:29:25.603
doesn't appear to be breaking. You can keep
waiting if you want.

01:29:25.603 --> 01:29:28.306
LAURA: I want to get one of those fancy drinks for
myself and see what it is.

01:29:28.306 --> 01:29:30.783
SAM: You mean the Korshad drink?

01:29:30.783 --> 01:29:32.892
LAURA: I want one of the Korshad drinks.

01:29:32.892 --> 01:29:35.327
MATT: One of the Korshad drinks, okay.

01:29:35.327 --> 01:29:39.558
TALIESIN: I would assume you've already had this
stuff at this point. We've been sharing a cup

01:29:39.558 --> 01:29:41.992
around. This is too much for a human being to
handle.

01:29:41.992 --> 01:29:45.505
MATT: Do you go to the bar?

01:29:45.505 --> 01:29:53.787
LAURA: I'll go up to the bar. We don't know his
name, do we? The bartender's name?

01:29:53.787 --> 01:29:57.304
MATT: You haven't asked him yet, no. There are a
few barhands that walk around, but the one you've

01:29:57.304 --> 01:30:00.391
been going with, you can go ahead and catch his
eye as you go through the area.

01:30:00.391 --> 01:30:02.678
"Hey, do you need something?"

01:30:02.678 --> 01:30:04.497
LAURA: Of course, darling. I didn't catch your
name.

01:30:04.497 --> 01:30:05.541
MATT: "Oh! Wence."

01:30:05.541 --> 01:30:11.485
LAURA: Wence, thank you so much. Could I grab
another of those fabulous five-gold drinks there,

01:30:11.485 --> 01:30:13.198
that you brought to our friend?

01:30:13.198 --> 01:30:17.674
MATT: "Oh, you want Schlond's Embrace. Okay. If
you're sure about that."

01:30:17.674 --> 01:30:19.753
LAURA: I don't know, what is it?

01:30:19.753 --> 01:30:28.284
MATT: "It's an acquired taste. It's made from a
very long-distilled, 40-year processing of a heavy

01:30:28.350 --> 01:30:36.697
"mint leaf, and that, when it's been very thickly
fermented, is mixed in with this very sour port

01:30:36.697 --> 01:30:42.867
"base that's been repeatedly funneled and sifted
until it's become almost thick in its own right.

01:30:42.867 --> 01:30:49.965
"That's mixed together with a few other sugars and a
bit of a special fruit. Honestly, I think it

01:30:49.965 --> 01:30:52.881
"tastes pretty shitty, but it's what he likes."

01:30:52.881 --> 01:30:54.323
LAURA: I'm going to give it a go.

01:30:54.323 --> 01:31:00.996
MATT: "All right then! Five gold." He goes and
makes the drink for you again.

01:31:00.996 --> 01:31:06.473
LAURA: Slowly but surely marking little amounts
off this party fund, y'all.

01:31:06.473 --> 01:31:08.766
MARISHA: Need to make some more money.

01:31:08.766 --> 01:31:15.053
MATT: However, he does not bring it in the same
glass. He brings it in a regular glass. You get

01:31:15.053 --> 01:31:27.863
the sense that the glass that was filled was his
own. But it's delivered and it's different. It

01:31:27.863 --> 01:31:34.567
almost has a weird, mushroomy flavor to it. The
fermentations involved in the processing of this

01:31:34.567 --> 01:31:42.621
is not the type of alcohol you'd expect. It's a
little musty. But it's functional, and it has an

01:31:42.621 --> 01:31:46.417
aftertaste that comes to a very strong mint, like
a wintergreen afterwards.

01:31:46.417 --> 01:31:48.964
It's a very strange mixture.

01:31:48.964 --> 01:31:51.141
LAURA: It's like brushing your teeth, only you get
drunk.

01:31:51.141 --> 01:31:56.038
MATT: Yeah, kind of. In fact, elements of it taste
like having orange juice

01:31:56.038 --> 01:31:57.413
after brushing your teeth.

01:31:57.413 --> 01:31:58.598
LAURA: Foul.

01:31:58.598 --> 01:32:01.421
MATT: Yeah. It's a little rough at times.

01:32:01.421 --> 01:32:06.207
MARISHA: What are you learning about the man by
what he drinks?

01:32:06.207 --> 01:32:08.702
LAURA: I'm learning that he probably has minty
fresh breath.

01:32:08.702 --> 01:32:09.865
MARISHA: Oh, really?

01:32:09.865 --> 01:32:12.553
ASHLEY: Maybe you should cheers him from afar so
he can see you're drinking it.

01:32:12.553 --> 01:32:14.551
LAURA: Yeah, but mine's in an ugly cup.

01:32:14.551 --> 01:32:18.052
MARISHA: They didn't give you the same cup?

01:32:18.052 --> 01:32:22.557
TRAVIS: I have nice cups. Do you want a
jewel-encrusted chalice?

01:32:22.557 --> 01:32:23.700
LAURA: Do you have one?

01:32:23.700 --> 01:32:25.050
TRAVIS: Yeah!

01:32:25.050 --> 01:32:26.382
LAURA: Pull it out.

01:32:26.382 --> 01:32:29.961
TRAVIS: I'm like fucking Bed, Bath, and Beyond in
this bitch. Jewel-encrusted chalice.

01:32:29.961 --> 01:32:33.951
LAURA: Do you really have a jewel-encrusted-- you
do, in your fucking Bag of Holding?

01:32:33.951 --> 01:32:35.987
TRAVIS: Not anymore, it's getting marked off now.

01:32:35.987 --> 01:32:40.183
LAURA: Sweet. I'm going to clean that shit out,
pour it in.

01:32:40.183 --> 01:32:43.301
TALIESIN: The interior of that bag looks like the
Pirates of the Caribbean ride.

01:32:43.301 --> 01:32:45.362
It's a little weird in there.

01:32:45.362 --> 01:32:54.893
MATT: It is a silver and pewter chalice that
contains a number of multi-colored gems embedded

01:32:54.893 --> 01:32:57.098
along the sides, going to the base.

01:32:57.098 --> 01:32:58.784
LAURA: This is gorgeous.

01:32:58.784 --> 01:33:01.234
MATT: Lil' Jon would be proud. It's beautiful.

01:33:01.234 --> 01:33:03.561
LAURA: Taryon. You drink out of this one.

01:33:03.561 --> 01:33:05.146
SAM: That drink?

01:33:05.146 --> 01:33:07.869
LAURA: Yeah, you're the one that bought him the
drink. Look like you're drinking it, too.

01:33:07.869 --> 01:33:10.306
SAM: All right. Pinky out.

01:33:10.306 --> 01:33:17.100
LAURA: How is it? Do you like it?

01:33:17.100 --> 01:33:19.299
SAM: I love it. (whispers) It's terrible.

01:33:19.299 --> 01:33:20.597
LAURA: I know.

01:33:20.597 --> 01:33:31.854
SAM: I'll just laugh, way too loud. (laughs) And
then she said to me, that's not armor!

01:33:31.910 --> 01:33:39.225
MATT: Another 20 or so minutes pass in the
tavern.

01:33:39.225 --> 01:33:45.488
MATT: Some folks have entered since then, some
have left. The patrons that are here don't seem to

01:33:45.488 --> 01:33:49.798
be-- there isn't a lot of switching in and out.
Seems like most of the folks here come here fairly

01:33:49.798 --> 01:33:56.062
often at the end of the day, whether to go about
their business or to unwind. But no one seems to

01:33:56.062 --> 01:34:00.150
be approaching you, no one's crossing your path.

01:34:00.150 --> 01:34:02.424
MARISHA: I'm so bored.

01:34:02.424 --> 01:34:05.360
LAURA: Can I go over and talk to Wence one more
time?

01:34:05.360 --> 01:34:09.984
MATT: Sure. You catch his attention. He comes back
to the table as you step up and start in his

01:34:09.984 --> 01:34:12.494
direction, he goes, "Hey. Another round, eh?"

01:34:12.494 --> 01:34:18.265
LAURA: Actually, no. I give him five gold.

01:34:18.265 --> 01:34:22.296
MATT: "All right. You want another one?"

01:34:22.296 --> 01:34:30.352
LAURA: No, I'd rather not. No, I was just
wondering, do you know how long Korshad usually

01:34:30.352 --> 01:34:32.637
hangs out here every night?

01:34:32.637 --> 01:34:39.273
MATT: "Varies. Easily probably another hour or
so."

01:34:39.273 --> 01:34:42.895
LAURA: Always with the same company, or different
people?

01:34:42.895 --> 01:34:48.869
MATT: "Varies. They've been here most of the
afternoon."

01:34:48.869 --> 01:34:59.844
LAURA: Oh, wow. Would you mind going over to him
and just letting him know that the gentleman who

01:34:59.844 --> 01:35:04.705
bought him the drink would love a moment of his
time.

01:35:04.705 --> 01:35:06.727
MATT: "Oh, all right."

01:35:06.727 --> 01:35:09.481
LAURA: Taryon Darrington. He needs to know the
name.

01:35:09.481 --> 01:35:18.834
MATT: "Okay. I will." He looks at the gold and
goes, "All right. I will."

01:35:18.834 --> 01:35:22.967
LAURA: No rush. But make sure it happens.

01:35:22.967 --> 01:35:30.094
MATT: You see he noticeably gets a little nervous.
Walks over. Do you go back to your table to join

01:35:30.094 --> 01:35:36.176
your compatriots? Okay. As you're watching, he
actually has to psych himself up. He approaches

01:35:36.176 --> 01:35:40.129
and then turns around and stops for a second, and
goes up to the table again and stops himself and

01:35:40.129 --> 01:35:46.856
gets the gumption up this time and goes to the
table. And you see him talking to Korshad, who at

01:35:46.856 --> 01:35:53.989
this point has his hand on the tip of the drink,
glances up at him. Looks over at the table again.

01:35:53.989 --> 01:36:00.053
LAURA: I walk over and put my hand on Taryon's
shoulder and keep eye-contact with Korshad.

01:36:00.053 --> 01:36:09.397
MATT: You see a smile creep slowly across
Korshad's face. Puts his hand up and immediately

01:36:09.397 --> 01:36:13.278
you can watch as Wence, who's in the middle of
talking and expressing this goes, "Yes." And

01:36:13.278 --> 01:36:18.582
quickly darts away. Korshad gives a point to the
rest of the guys and you watch his lips say,

01:36:18.582 --> 01:36:21.868
"Excuse me a moment." He stands up.

01:36:21.868 --> 01:36:24.926
SAM: Make some room. Grog, leave!

01:36:24.926 --> 01:36:27.461
MARISHA: I scoot with Grog.

01:36:27.461 --> 01:36:30.667
TRAVIS: We get up. I get up.

01:36:30.667 --> 01:36:36.013
MARISHA: I get up with Grog, too. Oh, I have to
pee. Do you want to go pee?

01:36:36.013 --> 01:36:41.787
MATT: As Korshad's walking across the room, Vax,
you do watch as all the individuals that are on

01:36:41.787 --> 01:36:50.472
the upper platform all watch him go through the
room and are now seeing the table and where they

01:36:50.472 --> 01:36:55.836
are standing. The attention is very strongly on
what is about to transpire.

01:36:55.836 --> 01:36:57.527
LIAM: So far just eyes, though?

01:36:57.527 --> 01:37:01.177
MARISHA: Yeah, I start paying attention to the
room as well, with Grog.

01:37:01.177 --> 01:37:05.487
LIAM: Grand Poobah, here.

01:37:05.487 --> 01:37:07.962
LAURA: You said that over the earring?

01:37:07.962 --> 01:37:09.197
LIAM: That was Liam.

01:37:09.197 --> 01:37:10.405
LAURA: Okay.

01:37:10.405 --> 01:37:14.926
MATT: Korshad walks his way over to the table and
you can see, as he walks through, occasionally

01:37:14.926 --> 01:37:21.909
somebody at a nearby table will stop and watch him
him. Very quickly to you, you get the sense that

01:37:21.909 --> 01:37:24.984
he's definitely one of the more powerful figures
that seems to come in and out of this

01:37:24.984 --> 01:37:31.318
establishment. He approaches the edge of the
table, still holding the cup from the upper lip.

01:37:31.318 --> 01:37:35.304
There's like a lip at the very edge that he keeps
clasped with his fingers as it drifts there in

01:37:35.304 --> 01:37:39.534
front of him, and he occasionally sips from it
that way as he walks towards you. Comes up to the

01:37:39.534 --> 01:37:43.766
edge of the table. "Do you mind if I sit here?"

01:37:43.766 --> 01:37:45.639
LAURA: Oh please, join us.

01:37:45.639 --> 01:37:51.457
MATT: He sits down and places the cup on the
table. (muffled) "So."

01:37:51.457 --> 01:37:57.427
(laughter)

01:37:57.427 --> 01:38:01.201
MATT: "My man Wence tells me that you are
requesting my presence."

01:38:01.201 --> 01:38:07.741
LAURA: Yes. For the sake of this. I'm going to
move my hands but just know my hands are here the

01:38:07.805 --> 01:38:09.321
whole time. Okay?

01:38:09.321 --> 01:38:10.273
MATT: Okay.

01:38:10.273 --> 01:38:11.814
(laughter)

01:38:11.814 --> 01:38:18.019
LAURA: I'm sure you're familiar with Taryon here.

01:38:18.019 --> 01:38:21.778
SAM: Taryon Darrington, of the Darrington family.

01:38:21.778 --> 01:38:23.795
MATT: I have not had the pleasure, but I know of
you.

01:38:23.795 --> 01:38:27.865
LAURA: And you are familiar with his father as
well?

01:38:27.865 --> 01:38:29.554
MATT: "Quite."

01:38:29.554 --> 01:38:38.342
LAURA: We've heard tell of recent situations with
his family and you.

01:38:38.342 --> 01:38:45.000
MATT: "And?"

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:53.458
LAURA: And we were hoping we could come to an
agreement.

01:38:53.458 --> 01:38:56.145
MATT: "What agreement do you have proposed?"

01:38:56.145 --> 01:39:00.176
LAURA: Well, I don't know if you've heard of Vox
Machina?

01:39:00.176 --> 01:39:12.735
MATT: "We trade in a great many things. Information
being one. And I am well aware of who you are."

01:39:12.735 --> 01:39:20.013
LAURA: And I'm well aware that someone like you
could find a good use for someone like us.

01:39:20.013 --> 01:39:22.084
MATT: "Are you offering your services?"

01:39:22.084 --> 01:39:26.219
LAURA: Potentially. If it could help clear the
Darrington name.

01:39:26.219 --> 01:39:40.325
MATT: (sighs) "You are not wrong. I, myself, am
the keeper of the deeds. I consider the Darrington

01:39:40.325 --> 01:39:52.482
"estate a long-growing loan that is now ripening.
You see, our community here thrives on a principle

01:39:52.482 --> 01:40:03.449
"that other syndicates in Exandria lack. Patience.
I have been letting this stew for a very, very

01:40:03.449 --> 01:40:13.359
"long time, so if you wish to make any sort of dent
in this debt,

01:40:13.359 --> 01:40:19.069
"your task will have to be equally monumental."

01:40:19.069 --> 01:40:27.407
SAM: Well, I can make magical items, if there's
something that you need made or enchanted. We have

01:40:27.407 --> 01:40:32.574
other members of the group that do different
things. We have a fine tinkerer, if you need

01:40:32.574 --> 01:40:40.858
something made for you. Vex here is an excellent
shot. She could put on an archery show or

01:40:40.858 --> 01:40:50.115
something, if that would be something worthwhile
to you. You know, if that will help ease the debt.

01:40:50.115 --> 01:40:54.089
I know my family owes you quite a bit of money.

01:40:54.089 --> 01:40:59.737
LAURA: 230,000 gold. If we're hearing correctly.

01:40:59.737 --> 01:41:02.866
MATT: "You are correct. For the time being."

01:41:02.866 --> 01:41:13.409
SAM: And might I inquire, as it is my family's
debt: what is the timetable on that? Will you be

01:41:13.409 --> 01:41:17.195
coming to collect anytime soon?

01:41:17.195 --> 01:41:29.873
MATT: "I have given your father a date of six
months to pay this debt. If it is not paid, then

01:41:29.873 --> 01:41:39.023
"the deeds, as agreed upon many years ago,
transition to my name entirely. I am not going to

01:41:39.023 --> 01:41:42.950
"kick your family to the street; I am not a
terrible man.

01:41:42.950 --> 01:41:47.387
"But I will be possessing all of your belongings."

01:41:47.387 --> 01:41:50.486
SAM: Will they be in any physical danger?

01:41:50.486 --> 01:41:54.342
MATT: "No. Not unless they put up a fight."

01:41:54.342 --> 01:42:05.314
SAM: Well, I don't know much about you, but I
assume you would much rather have the cash than have to

01:42:05.355 --> 01:42:07.531
own property and manage it.

01:42:07.531 --> 01:42:09.405
MATT: "Both have their uses."

01:42:09.405 --> 01:42:11.638
SAM: All right.

01:42:11.638 --> 01:42:15.326
LAURA: So would the Darringtons simply work for
you?

01:42:15.326 --> 01:42:26.969
MATT: "The family, I will happily give them time to
find whatever place they can afford to live or

01:42:26.969 --> 01:42:34.032
"leave the city entirely. It is not my business.
However, I will be taking over the farms, I will

01:42:34.032 --> 01:42:40.325
"be taking over the business, I will be taking over
the estate. Most of the assets within, they will

01:42:40.325 --> 01:42:43.098
"become property of the Myriad."

01:42:43.098 --> 01:42:48.857
TALIESIN: Well, there. That's where I think we could
come to an arrangement. We're not particularly

01:42:48.857 --> 01:42:58.867
invested in the power structure here. We're here
for sentimental reasons. The estate and just

01:42:58.867 --> 01:43:05.274
enough property to maintain a modest
comfortability. We don't really care what happens

01:43:05.274 --> 01:43:07.874
to the fortune so long as your family's taken
care of.

01:43:07.874 --> 01:43:10.644
SAM: Yes, I guess.

01:43:10.644 --> 01:43:13.895
TALIESIN: You keep your house, you keep your
things, you keep a little bit

01:43:13.895 --> 01:43:16.216
of property to manage.

01:43:16.216 --> 01:43:18.063
SAM: Sure.

01:43:18.063 --> 01:43:31.932
TALIESIN: What do you think? I mean, they did make
this bed. I'm suggesting to you that maybe it is

01:43:31.932 --> 01:43:38.061
not your job to save your family's power and allow
them to keep going as the way they have. But just

01:43:38.061 --> 01:43:45.506
to give them enough that even if they-- that they
can continue with reasonable means. Maybe not

01:43:45.506 --> 01:43:49.942
necessarily living the life that they were living
before but living far more comfortably.

01:43:49.942 --> 01:43:55.169
SAM: Even that would be a step up, but it seems
like we would have to do something in order just

01:43:55.169 --> 01:43:56.530
to earn that much.

01:43:56.530 --> 01:44:01.237
TALIESIN: Oh, I imagine so. It's just, there's a
difference between saving everything and saving

01:44:01.237 --> 01:44:03.397
enough to keep them comfortable.

01:44:03.397 --> 01:44:10.617
MATT: "If I am to understand you correctly, you
are willing to offer your service to us?"

01:44:10.617 --> 01:44:11.889
TALIESIN: Possibly.

01:44:11.889 --> 01:44:21.011
MATT: "And in exchange, we would still be taking
the land-based assets from the Darrington name,

01:44:21.011 --> 01:44:27.565
"other than the estate and enough means to live
comfortably."

01:44:27.565 --> 01:44:34.944
TALIESIN: And enough income property for them to
be relatively comfortable. Reasonably comfortable.

01:44:34.944 --> 01:44:39.911
I'm sure we can take a look at the assets and come
to a very, very reasonable arrangement. And you,

01:44:39.911 --> 01:44:45.355
in turn-- well, we could have a discussion about
what that would be worth to you. I have no

01:44:45.355 --> 01:44:50.930
interest in making an arrangement that doesn't
please you. We're only here, again, for

01:44:50.930 --> 01:44:54.130
sentimental reasons. We are not invested beyond
that.

01:44:54.130 --> 01:44:56.882
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

01:44:56.882 --> 01:45:03.216
TALIESIN: Please, god. You've been terrible today.
15.

01:45:03.216 --> 01:45:15.238
MATT: He goes, "Comfortable living is a relative
thing. To maintain my comfort of living, well,

01:45:15.238 --> 01:45:22.215
"your estate is but a drop in the bucket. But, and
I mean no offense--" as he looks about the rest of

01:45:22.215 --> 01:45:29.916
you-- "Comfortable living for some of you, well,
that could be as much as my drink would cost."

01:45:29.916 --> 01:45:41.489
SAM: My family would require their main property
and all residential rental property.

01:45:41.489 --> 01:45:48.486
MATT: "That is not a deal. The residential and the
farm territory is to become mine. I would leave

01:45:48.486 --> 01:45:59.438
"for them your estate and enough gold to live a
comparably comfortable lifestyle than living on

01:45:59.438 --> 01:46:05.120
"the street for years to come. They could then
strike out on their own, start a new fortune if

01:46:05.120 --> 01:46:10.483
"they wish. Perhaps land barony was not their
strong suit. You seem to have found other

01:46:10.483 --> 01:46:14.031
"pursuits, maybe you could lead them in a new
path."

01:46:14.031 --> 01:46:17.391
LAURA: And past that point, they would be in no
debt to you?

01:46:17.391 --> 01:46:25.962
MATT: "Past that point, and a task done in our
favor by the famed Vox Machina. Maybe."

01:46:25.962 --> 01:46:38.439
SAM: Would they get to maintain possession of
their personal property? Artwork, statues?

01:46:38.439 --> 01:46:44.494
MATT: "Everything that remains within the estate
home itself would be yours to keep.

01:46:44.494 --> 01:46:49.182
"The rest is mine."

01:46:49.182 --> 01:46:51.678
SAM: And what is this task?

01:46:51.678 --> 01:47:03.837
MATT: "Roughly 120 miles east of here lies a
sinkhole. It has swallowed the core of the

01:47:03.837 --> 01:47:13.070
"platinum mines of Herethis a few months back. Now,
those mines are a very lucrative point of business

01:47:13.070 --> 01:47:23.094
"for my employers. And every time we've sent scouts
to inspect the source of this erosion, none have

01:47:23.094 --> 01:47:34.754
"returned. Many very capable and proven men,
unheard again. One of our greatest diviners has

01:47:34.754 --> 01:47:49.230
"since spoken of a powerful force within this mine.
Ancient. Birthed improperly. But now seems to grow

01:47:49.230 --> 01:47:57.998
"more and more mad. We're at a loss, so we've put
out a contract or two, but nothing has taken a

01:47:57.998 --> 01:48:10.019
"bite yet. If you were to go to this mine, find
this entity that has ruined our mining operation

01:48:10.019 --> 01:48:15.249
"there, return with proof of its demise, and we
confirm its destruction,

01:48:15.249 --> 01:48:19.169
"I will consider our task complete."

01:48:19.169 --> 01:48:29.840
TALIESIN: We'll also need some operating capital
for this. It sounds dangerous, so we will take the

01:48:29.840 --> 01:48:38.404
job, but we will need to also charge a very
reasonable fee, I think, on top of this.

01:48:38.404 --> 01:48:42.973
MATT: "That is entirely understood. And we will
keep track of each fee, and we will deduct it from

01:48:42.973 --> 01:48:46.741
"the materials in the Darrington estate."

01:48:46.741 --> 01:48:53.976
LAURA: If we take care of this for you, it does
seem like a monumental task.

01:48:53.976 --> 01:49:01.070
MATT: "It may not be. But it would seem to be
something of your skill set."

01:49:01.070 --> 01:49:11.215
LAURA: From what we've learned, ancient beings
tend to be quite powerful. We would ask that you

01:49:11.215 --> 01:49:23.009
don't slander the Darrington name. That when they
stay in their estate, everyone believes they are

01:49:23.009 --> 01:49:26.650
still the Darringtons as they have always been.

01:49:26.650 --> 01:49:33.543
MATT: "I would agree to that. I have no interests
in your family's public image. I believe that

01:49:33.543 --> 01:49:37.021
"damage has been done well enough on your own."

01:49:37.021 --> 01:49:41.202
SAM: Yes. Are you sure you don't have a cloak I
could just enchant

01:49:41.202 --> 01:49:43.478
and then we could call it square?

01:49:43.478 --> 01:49:50.632
MATT: (chuckling) He takes another sip from his
drink. "When all this is said and done, Taryon,

01:49:50.632 --> 01:49:55.998
"we'll be in contact. I think there is much
business we could do in the future."

01:49:55.998 --> 01:50:01.451
SAM: All right. I suppose we have no choice.

01:50:01.451 --> 01:50:02.928
TALIESIN: We do.

01:50:02.928 --> 01:50:05.128
LAURA: There's always a choice, dear.

01:50:05.128 --> 01:50:08.981
MARISHA: You could marry the girl or we could go
kill an ancient being.

01:50:08.981 --> 01:50:11.334
TALIESIN: I'm feeling pretty good about this one.

01:50:11.334 --> 01:50:12.331
MARISHA: Yeah!

01:50:12.331 --> 01:50:14.373
SAM: All right.

01:50:14.373 --> 01:50:21.943
LAURA: Do we need to decide at this moment?

01:50:21.943 --> 01:50:24.143
SAM: Seems like we do.

01:50:24.143 --> 01:50:28.139
TALIESIN: We will also need all of the information
you have on this creature in the mines, and

01:50:28.139 --> 01:50:30.721
if you have anybody who has access to that--

01:50:30.721 --> 01:50:33.287
LAURA: The diviner would be wonderful to speak
to.

01:50:33.287 --> 01:50:36.389
MATT: "The information I have given you is
what the diviner has found."

01:50:36.432 --> 01:50:45.828
SAM: I'm not going to ask you all to risk your
lives for my shitty family, so I will pursue this

01:50:45.828 --> 01:50:47.931
matter on my own if I have to.

01:50:47.931 --> 01:50:49.611
LAURA: Good. Yeah. You're going to go by
yourself.

01:50:49.611 --> 01:50:55.802
SAM: Well, I would hire a couple of people to come
with me, but if you'd like to accompany me, I'd be

01:50:55.802 --> 01:50:57.729
okay with that too.

01:50:57.729 --> 01:51:00.150
TRAVIS: We could watch you do it. That'd be pretty
funny.

01:51:00.150 --> 01:51:04.663
SAM: Well, I mean, you've taught me a lot, so
maybe I could do it.

01:51:04.663 --> 01:51:06.433
LAURA: I think you're good.

01:51:06.433 --> 01:51:10.381
ASHLEY: You won't find anybody as good as us.

01:51:10.381 --> 01:51:11.849
SAM: Of course not.

01:51:11.849 --> 01:51:17.625
MARISHA: You are very skilled in hiring talented
mercenaries. That might be your strongest suit.

01:51:17.625 --> 01:51:20.619
SAM: I am one for two on that count.

01:51:20.619 --> 01:51:25.472
TALIESIN: And we do have another mercenary at our
beck, if we need. That's actually very fair.

01:51:25.472 --> 01:51:27.202
You're already one up.

01:51:27.202 --> 01:51:31.346
SAM: Should we vote on it then? Grog, do you want
to go kill something big and scary?

01:51:31.346 --> 01:51:32.348
TRAVIS: Yes.

01:51:32.348 --> 01:51:34.738
SAM: Pike, are you drunk?

01:51:34.738 --> 01:51:46.537
ASHLEY: I think you should marry whoever you want.
So that's what I think we should do. Yes. Yea. I

01:51:46.537 --> 01:51:47.926
vote yea.

01:51:47.926 --> 01:51:49.005
SAM: Twinsies?

01:51:49.015 --> 01:51:50.605
LAURA: Always have your back, dear.

01:51:50.605 --> 01:52:00.415
SAM: Oh, Vax isn't here. Hey Vax. You want to go
help me save my family by risking our lives in

01:52:00.485 --> 01:52:02.531
almost certain death?

01:52:02.531 --> 01:52:04.803
LIAM: What does that entail?

01:52:04.803 --> 01:52:07.826
SAM: I'll take that as a yes. Keyleth?

01:52:07.826 --> 01:52:12.178
MARISHA: Vax says yes, and so do I! Aye!

01:52:12.178 --> 01:52:14.772
SAM: Science bro?

01:52:14.772 --> 01:52:19.984
TALIESIN: Vex says yes, and I am so in the mood to
kill something.

01:52:19.984 --> 01:52:23.061
(laughter)

01:52:23.061 --> 01:52:28.866
MARISHA: I think we've all risked our lives for each
other at one point and another, so it's your turn,

01:52:28.929 --> 01:52:31.372
Tary. Welcome to the family.

01:52:31.372 --> 01:52:34.461
TALIESIN: Cheers. This stuff burns.

01:52:34.461 --> 01:52:42.332
MATT: And this whole conversation he's had his
mouth covered, he takes his fingers away from his

01:52:42.332 --> 01:52:53.029
mouth and he takes the drink. "Do we have an
accord?" Picks his drink up and clinks it. "Return

01:52:53.029 --> 01:52:57.289
"when the deed is done." Slaps the table and stands
up and walks back. And at this point, that you

01:52:57.289 --> 01:53:06.467
notice, the tables nearby, everyone's been just
quietly watching in on this. As soon as he leaves

01:53:06.617 --> 01:53:09.408
they go back to their business and drinking.

01:53:09.408 --> 01:53:13.412
TALIESIN: Everyone, on the count of three, we're
going to stand up very quickly.

01:53:13.412 --> 01:53:14.884
MARISHA: Okay.

01:53:14.884 --> 01:53:18.574
SAM: Why? Okay.

01:53:18.574 --> 01:53:20.862
LIAM: Wait! No, I'm just fucking with you.

01:53:20.862 --> 01:53:22.643
LAURA: Three! Let's go!

01:53:22.643 --> 01:53:30.671
MATT: As you do that, about half the folks get
startled by it. The music's still going.

01:53:30.671 --> 01:53:35.058
LAURA: On the way out, can I grab Wence again, one
last time?

01:53:35.058 --> 01:53:37.017
MATT: "Hey."

01:53:37.017 --> 01:53:40.779
LAURA: Most of the people here, are they local
patrons or do they come from all over?

01:53:40.779 --> 01:53:48.734
MATT: "Most of them are local and come from all
over."

01:53:48.734 --> 01:53:50.705
LAURA: Great. Thank you.

01:53:50.705 --> 01:53:52.073
MATT: "Sorry."

01:53:52.073 --> 01:53:53.688
LAURA: It's all I needed.

01:53:53.688 --> 01:53:55.498
MATT: "I just serve the drinks, miss."

01:53:55.498 --> 01:53:59.173
TRAVIS: Can I make my way back over to the
players?

01:53:59.173 --> 01:54:03.517
MATT: Okay. She's sitting there. (drumming)

01:54:03.517 --> 01:54:06.624
TRAVIS: Can I have your name?

01:54:06.624 --> 01:54:10.242
MATT: (drumming)

01:54:10.242 --> 01:54:14.517
TRAVIS: (louder) Can I have your name?

01:54:14.517 --> 01:54:22.149
MATT: As she's still drumming her head slowly
turns around and she goes, "Camilla." (drumming)

01:54:22.149 --> 01:54:24.633
TRAVIS: Thank you, and I leave.

01:54:24.633 --> 01:54:31.363
MATT: (laughs) All right. With that, we're going
to take a break. Try and get back here in a minute

01:54:31.363 --> 01:54:34.612
guys, see this next bit of interesting fun.

01:54:34.612 --> 01:54:36.127
MARISHA: To Camilla!

01:54:36.127 --> 01:54:44.911
MATT: All right guys, so we have tonight's Wyrmwood
giveaway: this awesome butternut wood and leather

01:54:44.911 --> 01:54:53.672
dice tray. Giveaway from our friends at Wyrmwood.
Come on over, jump into the Twitch chat to

01:54:53.672 --> 01:55:00.324
enter for the possibility to win this, the word

01:55:00.324 --> 01:55:02.096
you don't know, look it up on Google.

01:55:02.096 --> 01:55:03.923
MARISHA: You'll win it if you spell it right.

01:55:03.923 --> 01:55:09.566
MATT: Exactly. Butternut up or shut up with your
Myriad spelling. All right guys, be back here in a

01:55:09.612 --> 01:55:12.002
few minutes. See you in a second.

01:55:12.002 --> 02:12:12.940
[break]

02:12:13.002 --> 02:12:17.223
MATT: Hello, everyone. Welcome back to Critical
Role. Which, timing works out interesting

02:12:17.223 --> 02:12:21.859
sometimes. Yeah, welcome back to the game. We had
our break. Going to go ahead and jump in here.

02:12:21.859 --> 02:12:25.359
LIAM: I feel cheated. I didn't hear any of that.

02:12:25.359 --> 02:12:26.424
SAM: (belches)

02:12:26.424 --> 02:12:27.473
LAURA: Nice.

02:12:27.473 --> 02:12:28.518
SAM: Thanks.

02:12:28.518 --> 02:12:35.980
MATT: As you guys have found your way out of what
seems to be this strange subterranean bar beneath

02:12:35.980 --> 02:12:46.640
the Grumpy Lily, you've agreed to, at least for
the time being, to make your way east to this

02:12:46.640 --> 02:12:54.795
mine, which currently seems to be under the--
what's it called? The Platinum Mines of

02:12:54.795 --> 02:13:04.162
Herethis. Herethis. Which you, Taryon, you
understand. Herethis is a region, a regional

02:13:04.162 --> 02:13:12.104
forest area over there. The Herethis Wood. About
120 miles east. You guys decide: What's your best

02:13:12.104 --> 02:13:15.230
means of travel? How do you intend to get there?

02:13:15.230 --> 02:13:20.965
SAM: We have to misty there, right? Because you
don't know any trees in the area?

02:13:20.965 --> 02:13:24.420
MARISHA: I could scry on the area if I knew enough
about it.

02:13:24.420 --> 02:13:27.690
TALIESIN: If we misty there we could also camp for
the night.

02:13:27.690 --> 02:13:30.830
LAURA: Yeah, we need to camp because we need to
rest and get our shit back.

02:13:30.830 --> 02:13:33.180
MARISHA: That's fine. It's 120 miles.

02:13:33.180 --> 02:13:37.365
MATT: It's not terribly far, as the mist flies.

02:13:37.427 --> 02:13:40.599
MARISHA: Yep. I'm pretty fresh.

02:13:40.641 --> 02:13:44.660
TALIESIN: We can misty there, camp for the night.

02:13:44.660 --> 02:13:47.222
TRAVIS: (repeatedly, getting deeper) Yeah.

02:13:47.222 --> 02:13:49.025
(laughter)

02:13:49.025 --> 02:13:50.565
TRAVIS: Character voice.

02:13:50.565 --> 02:13:52.706
MATT: Well, I'll go ahead and by the way, because
I totally forgot. We do have a winner in the

02:13:52.706 --> 02:13:58.898
chatroom. Besolis8926, you won the giveaway.

02:13:58.898 --> 02:14:01.532
LIAM: You got the Nutter Butter box!

02:14:01.532 --> 02:14:05.713
MATT: Yeah, Denova will contact you for your
information to get it shipped to you, so

02:14:05.713 --> 02:14:10.896
congratulations. All right, so. What are you
thinking about for travel? You're just doing the

02:14:10.896 --> 02:14:12.933
Wind Walk?

02:14:12.933 --> 02:14:17.970
MARISHA: All right, before we leave, is there any
type of research we should potentially do?

02:14:17.970 --> 02:14:19.346
TRAVIS: Nope. Headlong.

02:14:19.346 --> 02:14:21.599
(laughter)

02:14:21.599 --> 02:14:25.691
SAM: I don't know what we'd be researching. The
guy who sent us on the mission doesn't even know

02:14:25.691 --> 02:14:26.695
what it is.

02:14:26.695 --> 02:14:30.854
LIAM: It's not even nearby, so it's not like we
could ask people what the mine is like. It's 120

02:14:30.854 --> 02:14:31.960
miles away.

02:14:31.960 --> 02:14:33.003
TRAVIS: Yep.

02:14:33.003 --> 02:14:34.555
LIAM: The mines of "hear this."

02:14:34.555 --> 02:14:36.068
LAURA: Herethis.

02:14:36.068 --> 02:14:38.806
TRAVIS: This is right up our alley. Like this is
literally what we've

02:14:38.806 --> 02:14:40.295
been training for our whole lives.

02:14:40.295 --> 02:14:44.093
MARISHA: I mean, just in case there's maybe some
ancient deity that rules over the forest of

02:14:44.093 --> 02:14:49.340
Herethis and some sort of goddess? Fuck it, let's
go.

02:14:49.340 --> 02:14:52.759
LAURA: I mean, do we know anything? Have we ever
heard about the woods of Herethis or the Platinum

02:14:52.759 --> 02:14:54.186
Mines of Herethis?

02:14:54.186 --> 02:15:00.048
MATT: You guys haven't. You have. They're woods
that lead into this small rocky-- it's almost too

02:15:00.048 --> 02:15:05.352
small to be a mountain range and more just large,
rocky hills. But there's no historical

02:15:05.352 --> 02:15:12.026
significance to the location that you know of. Go
ahead and make a history check.

02:15:12.026 --> 02:15:13.657
TRAVIS: Roll high.

02:15:13.657 --> 02:15:15.702
TALIESIN: That'll do.

02:15:15.702 --> 02:15:18.278
SAM: Oh yeah! 21.

02:15:18.278 --> 02:15:29.932
MATT: 21. You do know a number of the large-scale
battles that took place towards the end of the Age

02:15:29.932 --> 02:15:36.964
of Arcanum took place on Wildmount. In fact,
Zorhaus, the other kingdom that we were discussing

02:15:36.964 --> 02:15:45.186
before is largely a badlands, barren landscape
because that was where the final battle between

02:15:45.186 --> 02:15:53.325
the Betrayer Gods and the Prime Deities took
place. And the sheer volume of, the sheer

02:15:53.325 --> 02:15:59.778
intensity of that battle laid waste to the
landscape there, so you have the Dwendalian Empire

02:15:59.778 --> 02:16:07.328
and the whole western side of Wildmount, which is
fairly lush and functional, then towards the

02:16:07.328 --> 02:16:12.295
Zorhaus Kingdom is, and that whole eastern side of
the continent, a lot of it is just barren,

02:16:12.295 --> 02:16:24.732
cracked, destroyed. But you do know that Herethis,
the name, at least, stems from a hero that fell in

02:16:24.732 --> 02:16:33.260
a battle long ago. You can't recall the specific
details of it, but there is some significance to

02:16:33.260 --> 02:16:37.275
the title or at least the location there to
something ancient and old. May have to deal with

02:16:37.275 --> 02:16:46.761
this time period of entities battling gods. That's
the best you can make out. The mines are well

02:16:46.761 --> 02:16:52.704
known. The Platinum Mines are well known. They're
not well attended. They're not a public space, and

02:16:52.704 --> 02:17:01.181
they're definitely under the control of a number
of companies that are shadow corporations under

02:17:01.181 --> 02:17:06.287
the control of the Myriad. You can see where the
connection and the necessity for it to be reopened

02:17:06.287 --> 02:17:11.847
again is important. Platinum is not a very common
metal.

02:17:11.847 --> 02:17:16.860
TRAVIS: Anything we should be worried about?

02:17:16.860 --> 02:17:19.051
SAM: Gods attacking us.

02:17:19.051 --> 02:17:20.262
TRAVIS: Nope.

02:17:20.262 --> 02:17:22.329
MARISHA: Trial run.

02:17:22.329 --> 02:17:29.086
LAURA: Oh man. No, but really, that's where the
battles took place, huh? So this ancient being

02:17:29.086 --> 02:17:31.336
could be from, potentially--

02:17:31.336 --> 02:17:32.614
SAM: Or it could not.

02:17:32.614 --> 02:17:35.383
TALIESIN: Whatever it is, it's not leaving the
mine.

02:17:35.383 --> 02:17:40.879
LIAM: We're running off on a lark, but we've raked
ourselves in the faces before.

02:17:40.879 --> 02:17:42.889
LAURA: Yeah! If we die, we die.

02:17:42.889 --> 02:17:44.737
SAM: Oh god, I don't want to die.

02:17:44.737 --> 02:17:46.538
TALIESIN: Well, no one wants to die.

02:17:46.538 --> 02:17:48.146
MARISHA: Well, once again--

02:17:48.146 --> 02:17:51.995
LAURA: Don't say it, Keyleth. Do not fucking say
it.

02:17:51.995 --> 02:17:54.721
TRAVIS: Don't incant that shit again.

02:17:54.721 --> 02:17:57.802
LAURA: Don't say it about all of us and doom us to
your fate.

02:17:57.802 --> 02:17:59.360
TRAVIS: Goldfish.

02:17:59.360 --> 02:18:00.501
MARISHA: Duty.

02:18:00.501 --> 02:18:02.602
(laughter)

02:18:02.602 --> 02:18:03.708
TRAVIS: Better.

02:18:03.708 --> 02:18:10.712
SAM: Before we go, was there something you wanted
to tell the drow woman?

02:18:10.712 --> 02:18:14.806
LAURA: Oh shit.

02:18:14.806 --> 02:18:24.292
LIAM: If we're talking about what we were talking
about before, I don't think it's a good idea.

02:18:24.292 --> 02:18:26.604
TRAVIS: Why?

02:18:26.604 --> 02:18:38.004
LIAM: If you want to go and find him, us, and say hi,
that's a different story.

02:18:38.004 --> 02:18:45.315
LAURA: I would like to point out that this same
person you are so adamantly protecting from our

02:18:45.315 --> 02:18:51.214
scrying or our spying or our finding is the same
person who shit in the middle of a temple so that

02:18:51.214 --> 02:18:52.803
he could watch Pike.

02:18:52.803 --> 02:18:58.190
LIAM: Well, A) he did that, not us, and B) we were
all very much friends and happy with each other

02:18:58.190 --> 02:19:07.334
when he did that, and he is not happy with us.
It's not exactly the same thing, dear. But if you

02:19:07.334 --> 02:19:14.044
want to go with me and find him and check
in and say hello, I'd be very happy to do that

02:19:14.044 --> 02:19:22.148
with you. But to send the woman who threw our
friend, drugged, over the back of a horse, and

02:19:22.148 --> 02:19:29.096
took him off to his family? I don't really want to
send her after Scanlan, to look in on him or

02:19:29.096 --> 02:19:35.440
follow him or watch him or anything him. It didn't
sound like his father wanted him dragged back on

02:19:35.440 --> 02:19:39.324
the back of a horse, and it happened anyway. She
doesn't seem very trustworthy to me. Yeah, she's

02:19:39.324 --> 02:19:40.950
cool. So what?

02:19:40.950 --> 02:19:49.576
LAURA: I just realized I have the other half of
the stone. The traveling stone.

02:19:49.576 --> 02:19:52.465
MARISHA: That we gave Scanlan.

02:19:52.465 --> 02:19:55.105
LAURA: I could pop in on him anytime I want.

02:19:55.105 --> 02:19:57.094
TALIESIN: Or he could pop in on you anytime.

02:19:57.094 --> 02:19:58.585
MARISHA: But he hasn't.

02:19:58.585 --> 02:20:00.052
TRAVIS: If he has it, still.

02:20:00.052 --> 02:20:02.969
MARISHA: Yeah, maybe he threw it into the ocean
for all we know.

02:20:02.969 --> 02:20:05.441
TRAVIS: Ooh, that would suck because then we'd be
in the ocean.

02:20:05.441 --> 02:20:08.262
LAURA: That would be really, really shit if he did
that.

02:20:08.262 --> 02:20:10.413
MARISHA: It would be a massively dickish move.

02:20:10.413 --> 02:20:12.070
LIAM: That was very smart, Grog.

02:20:12.070 --> 02:20:14.009
TRAVIS: Hey.

02:20:14.009 --> 02:20:17.155
TALIESIN: Wow, that happened.

02:20:17.155 --> 02:20:19.833
TRAVIS: In your face.

02:20:19.833 --> 02:20:26.949
LIAM: Oh. Anyway, my point still stands. Once we
wrap up here if you want to go

02:20:26.949 --> 02:20:28.614
find him I will go with you.

02:20:28.614 --> 02:20:32.561
MARISHA: And do what? Convince him to come back?

02:20:32.561 --> 02:20:33.865
LIAM: No.

02:20:33.865 --> 02:20:36.130
MARISHA: See if he's okay? Ask him how his year's
been?

02:20:36.130 --> 02:20:37.741
LIAM: Yeah.

02:20:37.741 --> 02:20:46.042
TRAVIS: What about just a location and she has to
stay unseen? You know, I know Keyleth can scry and

02:20:46.042 --> 02:20:47.107
stuff but--

02:20:47.107 --> 02:20:49.819
TALIESIN: We could make her walk first into the
mines.

02:20:49.819 --> 02:20:54.467
MARISHA: Yeah, you didn't want me to even scry on
him and now we're talking about just popping in on

02:20:54.467 --> 02:20:57.851
him? I feel like there's a weird crossing of the
lines.

02:20:57.851 --> 02:21:00.441
TRAVIS: Yeah, but that was a year ago. I'm over that
sentiment.

02:21:00.490 --> 02:21:02.447
MARISHA: Oh man, Grog.

02:21:02.447 --> 02:21:03.907
TRAVIS: Yeah. Yep.

02:21:03.907 --> 02:21:08.443
MARISHA: You guilted me very hard on that. You
made me feel kind of shitty.

02:21:08.443 --> 02:21:10.591
TRAVIS: This is Grog evolved.

02:21:10.591 --> 02:21:15.766
MARISHA: No, you kind of got it right. Just go
with it.

02:21:15.766 --> 02:21:17.480
TALIESIN and LAURA: Exalted?

02:21:17.480 --> 02:21:19.733
TRAVIS: Absorbed. Yep.

02:21:19.733 --> 02:21:21.484
LIAM: You done been woked.

02:21:21.484 --> 02:21:23.093
TRAVIS: Woked.

02:21:23.093 --> 02:21:27.373
LIAM: So woked.

02:21:27.373 --> 02:21:35.129
LAURA: No, but seriously. What are we doing? I
don't think we use that mercenary to walk into a

02:21:35.129 --> 02:21:37.840
mine. I'm not sending her to her death.

02:21:37.840 --> 02:21:41.800
TALIESIN: I am perfectly content to hold onto that
chit for as long as we need.

02:21:41.800 --> 02:21:46.215
LIAM: Save that for a rainy day. We don't need to
punch that ticket now.

02:21:46.215 --> 02:21:51.890
SAM: Should we at least ask her to stay in town?
For a to-be-determined mission later?

02:21:51.890 --> 02:21:54.464
TRAVIS: Well, I think she needs to keep up her
employment, right?

02:21:54.464 --> 02:21:58.960
SAM: We can give her a little money to keep
around, a retainer.

02:21:58.960 --> 02:22:01.736
LAURA: No.

02:22:01.736 --> 02:22:04.643
SAM: I can give her a little money. I might need
her.

02:22:04.643 --> 02:22:09.704
TALIESIN: She was employed. She's reachable
through employment. We can just find out how to

02:22:09.704 --> 02:22:10.688
reach her.

02:22:10.688 --> 02:22:12.232
TRAVIS: Oh, yeah, that one!

02:22:12.232 --> 02:22:13.545
SAM: She might be gone.

02:22:13.545 --> 02:22:18.296
TALIESIN: You have to be able to hire her. I'm
sure there's a system.

02:22:18.296 --> 02:22:23.171
SAM: We have no idea how she was hired in the
first place.

02:22:23.171 --> 02:22:24.898
LAURA: We go ask her how to hire her.

02:22:24.898 --> 02:22:26.790
SAM: All right, well then let's do that.

02:22:26.790 --> 02:22:30.346
MARISHA: And no one has heard from him at all over
the course of the year?

02:22:30.346 --> 02:22:31.305
TRAVIS: Who?

02:22:31.305 --> 02:22:33.551
LAURA: Oh. Well, he writes me all the time, but
outside of that.

02:22:33.551 --> 02:22:36.486
TRAVIS: What? Really?! Scanlan does?!

02:22:36.486 --> 02:22:37.940
MARISHA: She's messing with you.

02:22:37.940 --> 02:22:41.547
TRAVIS: That was very mean.

02:22:41.547 --> 02:22:44.512
TALIESIN: You promised you'd keep that secret.

02:22:44.512 --> 02:22:46.220
LIAM: She has a mean streak.

02:22:46.220 --> 02:22:50.202
LAURA: (laughs) I have so many secrets to keep,
dear. So many.

02:22:50.202 --> 02:22:55.999
TRAVIS: I'm mad for an (stutters) a long time.

02:22:55.999 --> 02:22:59.652
LIAM: I know one of them. When she farts it sounds
like a duck.

02:22:59.652 --> 02:23:01.586
LAURA: It really does.

02:23:01.586 --> 02:23:03.031
MARISHA: That's kind of cute.

02:23:03.031 --> 02:23:06.940
LAURA: We go find-- (laughs)

02:23:06.940 --> 02:23:11.527
TALIESIN: You're going to fart awkwardly and we're
going to yell "imposter!"

02:23:11.527 --> 02:23:19.025
MATT: All right, so you find K'rynn. She let you know
that she was just around the corner from where the

02:23:19.310 --> 02:23:28.826
estate was and let you know where to find her, and
it's like an open tent/lounge area. She's just

02:23:28.987 --> 02:23:33.082
currently drinking water and eating a little bit
of dried meat, and as you approach, she stands up.

02:23:33.082 --> 02:23:37.497
She still has her illusion on. She still has her
pale skin. You get the sense that drow in general

02:23:37.497 --> 02:23:42.927
are not-- they don't have the easiest time walking
through large societal establishments.

02:23:42.927 --> 02:23:48.721
"You returned. So what did you need?"

02:23:48.721 --> 02:23:56.619
SAM: We have no mission at this moment, but we may
call on you shortly after we return.

02:23:56.619 --> 02:23:58.286
MATT: "Very well."

02:23:58.286 --> 02:24:00.911
SAM: Can we find you here or will you be gone?

02:24:00.911 --> 02:24:03.400
MATT: "I have no interest in staying in this city
in particular.

02:24:03.400 --> 02:24:06.639
"I generally prefer to stay around Vashlow."

02:24:06.639 --> 02:24:08.590
SAM: Where's that?

02:24:08.590 --> 02:24:14.673
MATT: "Vashlow? It's to the west of here. About 25
miles southeast of Port Demali."

02:24:14.673 --> 02:24:17.048
TRAVIS: Port Demali.

02:24:17.048 --> 02:24:22.959
MATT: "If you wish to contact me, you can send a
missive to Vashlow, or if you have access to a

02:24:22.959 --> 02:24:27.903
"practitioner of the arcane arts, perhaps a Sending
would be sufficient."

02:24:27.903 --> 02:24:29.424
SAM: Sending, okay.

02:24:29.424 --> 02:24:30.743
LAURA: Definitely.

02:24:30.743 --> 02:24:43.667
SAM: All right. Well, stand by. We'll call you.
Thank you for your time, and we'll be in touch.

02:24:43.667 --> 02:24:48.968
MATT: "Very well. It was just business."

02:24:48.968 --> 02:24:51.340
SAM: Sorry about your horse.

02:24:51.340 --> 02:24:59.490
MATT: "Eh. Fair trade." She gets up and gathers
her little satchel over the side of her shoulder.

02:24:59.490 --> 02:25:05.879
"Until we meet again." She nods and then walks out
into the darkness of the night.

02:25:05.879 --> 02:25:10.895
LAURA: Never to be heard from again because we'll
forget that we have that connection.

02:25:10.895 --> 02:25:12.565
(laughter)

02:25:12.565 --> 02:25:19.427
MATT: All right, so what are you guys doing?

02:25:19.427 --> 02:25:23.838
SAM: Let's Misty Step. Let's Wind Walk.

02:25:23.838 --> 02:25:26.770
LAURA: Misty Step tonight and then that way we can
recover everything?

02:25:26.770 --> 02:25:28.021
TALIESIN: In the morning.

02:25:28.021 --> 02:25:29.525
MARISHA: Yeah, what time is it?

02:25:29.525 --> 02:25:30.931
MATT: You're in the evening now.

02:25:30.931 --> 02:25:32.215
LAURA: Let's Misty Step there--

02:25:32.215 --> 02:25:34.682
MATT: Misty Step is a very different spell.

02:25:34.682 --> 02:25:36.162
LAURA: Oh, sorry.

02:25:36.162 --> 02:25:38.321
LIAM: We go 30 feet.

02:25:38.321 --> 02:25:40.627
(laughter)

02:25:40.627 --> 02:25:46.581
SAM: We're going to be windtalkers.

02:25:46.581 --> 02:25:52.874
MATT: Yes. All right, so you guys go ahead and
transform into your misty forms via the Wind Walk

02:25:52.874 --> 02:26:02.080
spell and begin making your way to the east,
towards the Herethis Wood. Travel is pretty rapid.

02:26:02.080 --> 02:26:09.749
It's a clear sky. The moon's still pretty-- it's
only been a few days since the last full moon when

02:26:09.749 --> 02:26:16.613
you guys had the ritual up at the top of the
mountains with the Trickfoots, so it's very easy

02:26:16.613 --> 02:26:23.177
to see the details, especially those of keen
vision. Rather rapidly, you find yourselves to the

02:26:23.177 --> 02:26:28.668
outskirts of the Herethis Forest, and after doing
a couple passes overhead, you can see there is a

02:26:28.668 --> 02:26:33.761
portion of the forest that is open, and there you
can see there are a couple of stone towers set up.

02:26:33.761 --> 02:26:42.109
There appear to be large ropes and cables fastened
at the edges of what looks to be a large circular

02:26:42.109 --> 02:26:50.218
ravine, some sort of an entry port, a very large
hole in the ground. And as you approach and get

02:26:50.218 --> 02:26:56.693
close you can see that, while there are two standing
towers, there appear to be remnants of two other

02:26:56.693 --> 02:27:01.348
towers that have fallen in, and looking at some of
the cables and the way that some of the equipment

02:27:01.348 --> 02:27:07.414
is set up, it appears that this sinkhole that he
spoke of that consumed a portion of this entryway,

02:27:07.414 --> 02:27:12.506
whether it be a quake or something, a lot of the
structure that was placed around the outside of

02:27:12.506 --> 02:27:19.698
the mine has fallen in, and is precariously being
held either dangling over the inside by cable work

02:27:19.698 --> 02:27:25.427
or has crumpled somewhere at the bottom of this
abyssal hole you see before you.

02:27:25.427 --> 02:27:31.061
MARISHA: What do you mean by--

02:27:31.061 --> 02:27:35.571
MATT: When I say abyssal hole, that's just a
descriptive way of saying it is pitch black from

02:27:35.571 --> 02:27:37.657
this distance. You cannot see anything past the
top.

02:27:37.657 --> 02:27:43.247
SAM: And it's connected to the Abyssal Plane.

02:27:43.247 --> 02:27:48.587
MATT: It is actually a doorway to the Abyss. Hey
guys! Orcus tonight!

02:27:48.587 --> 02:27:51.518
MARISHA: Finale!

02:27:51.518 --> 02:27:55.772
TRAVIS: Do we have any glow sticks that we could
throw in and watch fall?

02:27:55.772 --> 02:27:58.925
TALIESIN: Yes, we actually do.

02:27:58.925 --> 02:28:03.892
MATT: Have you guys transitioned back to your
physical forms to have this conversation?

02:28:03.892 --> 02:28:06.356
MARISHA: Yeah. Well, we can float down.

02:28:06.356 --> 02:28:12.385
TALIESIN: If we're doing our little circle, I
would say that a little bit of a distance.

02:28:12.385 --> 02:28:14.406
LAURA: Yeah, I don't want to camp right next to
the--

02:28:14.406 --> 02:28:17.709
TALIESIN: About half a mile away.

02:28:17.709 --> 02:28:20.979
LIAM: I'm looking for cooties around the outside.

02:28:20.979 --> 02:28:23.516
MATT: Okay, make a perception check.

02:28:23.516 --> 02:28:24.820
LIAM: Cooties.

02:28:24.820 --> 02:28:27.055
LAURA: Did you get it?

02:28:27.055 --> 02:28:29.179
ASHLEY: No, it's right here.

02:28:29.179 --> 02:28:31.003
LIAM: Dang it. 24.

02:28:31.003 --> 02:28:45.734
MATT: 24. Okay, you start coasting over the edge, and
you can see there are broken carts and crates. You

02:28:45.734 --> 02:28:55.781
can see the remains of what seem to be a couple of
humanoid bodies, mostly picked away to the point

02:28:55.781 --> 02:29:00.843
where there's just slightly pinkish bone from
whatever dried bits of muscle or blood that

02:29:00.843 --> 02:29:05.082
remain, the rest of the flesh and organs pulled
from or dissolved. You're not sure.

02:29:05.082 --> 02:29:08.761
LAURA: I think a Cure Wounds, a light Cure Wounds
would probably help.

02:29:08.761 --> 02:29:10.837
SAM: Dead talk?

02:29:10.837 --> 02:29:13.397
TALIESIN: They don't talk back, but yeah.

02:29:13.397 --> 02:29:15.378
SAM: Let's do that.

02:29:15.378 --> 02:29:17.739
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, you can do that!

02:29:17.739 --> 02:29:21.209
ASHLEY: We can talk to the dead. I have it.

02:29:21.209 --> 02:29:26.970
LAURA: We'll land a little bit away.

02:29:26.970 --> 02:29:29.858
TRAVIS: We didn't land yet, right?

02:29:29.858 --> 02:29:31.337
LAURA: Let's land a little bit away.

02:29:31.337 --> 02:29:33.299
LIAM: Getting some Baldur's Gate vibes here, man.

02:29:33.299 --> 02:29:38.919
MATT: So you land about half a mile out, and you
guys transition back to your physical forms. Vax

02:29:38.919 --> 02:29:41.363
shares the information and what he spotted.

02:29:41.363 --> 02:29:43.940
LAURA: Were the bodies on top or were the bodies
down below?

02:29:43.940 --> 02:29:45.110
LIAM: On the edges, right?

02:29:45.110 --> 02:29:46.875
MATT: They were on the edges.

02:29:46.875 --> 02:29:51.873
MARISHA: And when you mean seared, like acid? Or
like heat?

02:29:51.873 --> 02:29:56.923
MATT: Like white and pink bone. Like just whatever
flesh was on there has been picked off.

02:29:56.923 --> 02:29:59.567
ASHLEY: Like something was eating them?

02:29:59.567 --> 02:30:01.254
TALIESIN: Can we speak to dead?

02:30:01.254 --> 02:30:02.906
LAURA: Pike can do that.

02:30:02.906 --> 02:30:10.177
TALIESIN: Why don't you two misty there, somebody
start setting up camp for tonight.

02:30:10.177 --> 02:30:12.413
LAURA: I'll go with Pike and we can stealth in.

02:30:12.413 --> 02:30:13.839
MARISHA: I'll start setting up camp.

02:30:13.839 --> 02:30:17.103
TALIESIN: You can still misty. We're still
misty-able. You can fly in, talk to them,

02:30:17.103 --> 02:30:18.401
and fly back out.

02:30:18.401 --> 02:30:19.796
LAURA: She can't talk to them as mist.

02:30:19.796 --> 02:30:21.140
TALIESIN: I mean, land and then--

02:30:21.140 --> 02:30:25.425
LAURA: Oh, okay. I'll cast Pass Without a Trace,
anyways, so we'll be stealthy going in.

02:30:25.425 --> 02:30:26.711
So I do that.

02:30:26.711 --> 02:30:28.854
MATT: All right, so. Is it just you, Pike? Who's
going with you?

02:30:28.854 --> 02:30:29.957
LAURA: And me.

02:30:29.957 --> 02:30:31.883
LIAM: I'm already standing by the bodies, yeah.

02:30:31.883 --> 02:30:33.305
MATT: All right, so you go back to the bodies with
them?

02:30:33.305 --> 02:30:34.545
LAURA: Okay, you're still out there?

02:30:34.545 --> 02:30:35.886
LIAM: No, I--

02:30:35.886 --> 02:30:39.705
MATT: All right, so the three of you are turning
back to mist and making your way back toward the

02:30:39.705 --> 02:30:40.975
entrance.

02:30:40.975 --> 02:30:43.118
TALIESIN: I'm going to set up the tents.

02:30:43.118 --> 02:30:51.750
MATT: Okay. You guys land near the edge of this
crumpled rock and you see where the ground itself

02:30:51.829 --> 02:30:58.304
has curled in and collapsed inward, and there are a
number of cables or ropes that go across and

02:30:58.346 --> 02:31:03.045
various large structures, the stone towers that
sit at the edge of this opening. You can see

02:31:03.045 --> 02:31:07.904
there's tension on these ropes and either the
rope's going to snap at some point as the weather

02:31:07.904 --> 02:31:13.125
gets harsher over here, or the rock is going to
crumble in if the ground keeps eroding. You're not

02:31:13.125 --> 02:31:19.330
sure if it's done, or if it's a slow crawling
thing. There before you, you see a body. You can

02:31:19.330 --> 02:31:27.719
see elements of clothing, torn and dried, crusted
with old blood. You see a boot that's left off to

02:31:27.719 --> 02:31:31.967
the side. The foot's been removed, but it looks
like the edge of it's been torn and ripped a bit.

02:31:31.967 --> 02:31:34.511
The skeleton's been picked clean.

02:31:34.511 --> 02:31:37.966
ASHLEY: Okay. We only see the one body?

02:31:37.966 --> 02:31:41.881
MATT: There are three bodies around the whole
exterior, but you've landed next to one.

02:31:41.881 --> 02:31:44.965
LIAM: When you said picked clean, do they look
like they've been chewed upon?

02:31:44.965 --> 02:31:47.036
MATT: Make an investigation check.

02:31:47.036 --> 02:31:49.869
LIAM: It's fine. 18.

02:31:49.869 --> 02:31:57.485
MATT: Looking at the bones, you can see signs of
what appear to be scratches or grooves across the

02:31:57.485 --> 02:32:09.321
bones... It's interesting. A lot of the bones have
a very smooth texture to them. You're used to

02:32:09.321 --> 02:32:14.688
seeing very porous, but it looks like elements of
the bones have melted slightly.

02:32:14.688 --> 02:32:15.860
LAURA: Oh, gods.

02:32:15.860 --> 02:32:22.457
LIAM: Slimes, jellies. All right.

02:32:22.457 --> 02:32:28.241
LAURA: I'm going to get my broom ready. And while
Pike is doing her ritual I'm just going to keep a

02:32:28.241 --> 02:32:32.099
hand on her, that if anything happens then I can
just take off with her in tow.

02:32:32.099 --> 02:32:37.500
MATT: Okay. Pike, you're casting Speak with Dead?

02:32:37.500 --> 02:32:39.635
ASHLEY: Yes.

02:32:39.635 --> 02:32:44.977
MATT: All right. It's easy enough for you to cast
it. It's quick. Ritual complete, you go ahead and you

02:32:44.977 --> 02:32:46.792
burn some incense.

02:32:46.977 --> 02:32:49.804
ASHLEY: Okay, I get three questions.

02:32:49.804 --> 02:32:58.647
MATT: And at which point, the skeleton, which is
face down on the ground by the way, the skull

02:32:58.647 --> 02:33:07.078
(bone creaking) creaks up and looks over. Like,
turns around and faces you as it reaches. It curls

02:33:07.078 --> 02:33:11.011
upward, almost in like an upward dog--

02:33:11.011 --> 02:33:13.028
LAURA: Like downward dog? Oh. What's that called?

02:33:13.028 --> 02:33:16.550
MATT: Cobra position, but the head's turned
completely around and curled up.

02:33:16.550 --> 02:33:20.818
LIAM: Oh, I get down close to it and go (groans) and
I flip it over.

02:33:20.863 --> 02:33:24.366
MATT: (rattling thud) It flips over on its back
and the head (bone creaking) turns back

02:33:24.366 --> 02:33:25.542
around to its right.

02:33:25.542 --> 02:33:26.808
LIAM: Sorry.

02:33:26.808 --> 02:33:28.152
MATT: You get five questions.

02:33:28.152 --> 02:33:29.226
ASHLEY: Five questions.

02:33:29.226 --> 02:33:30.526
MARISHA: Five?

02:33:30.526 --> 02:33:35.851
ASHLEY: Good day, sir. It's not a good day for
you. Sorry.

02:33:35.851 --> 02:33:37.221
TRAVIS: Wow.

02:33:37.221 --> 02:33:39.391
LAURA: It's okay. Good start.

02:33:39.391 --> 02:33:42.617
ASHLEY: What happened to you?

02:33:42.617 --> 02:34:04.776
MATT: (raspy, strained) "Something in the mines we
found. It hatched. Or woke. And its anger shook

02:34:04.776 --> 02:34:18.807
"the halls. I tried to run, but the skittering
beasts got me first."

02:34:18.807 --> 02:34:21.532
LAURA: Skittering beasts?

02:34:21.532 --> 02:34:23.116
TRAVIS: Godzilla.

02:34:23.116 --> 02:34:25.030
LIAM: That's more than one.

02:34:25.030 --> 02:34:27.585
LAURA: (whispering) What did the skitterers look
like?

02:34:27.585 --> 02:34:35.688
ASHLEY: What did the skittering beasts look like?

02:34:35.688 --> 02:34:37.498
LAURA: Oh, in my drink?

02:34:37.498 --> 02:34:39.160
LIAM: It flew away.

02:34:39.160 --> 02:34:41.310
MARISHA: Yeah, it's a dick.

02:34:41.310 --> 02:34:57.155
MATT: (raspy, strained) "Large. Hard carapaces.
Pincers. Many legs."

02:34:57.155 --> 02:34:59.560
ASHLEY: (whispering) It's like spiders.

02:34:59.560 --> 02:35:01.680
TRAVIS: Umber hulk?

02:35:01.680 --> 02:35:04.172
LIAM: Umber hulk with many legs.

02:35:04.172 --> 02:35:09.915
MARISHA: That could be a glabrezu, which fucking
killed you the first time. They have pincers.

02:35:09.915 --> 02:35:11.642
LAURA: Yeah, but that's really big.

02:35:11.642 --> 02:35:14.485
MARISHA: I don't know. Skittering beasts?

02:35:14.485 --> 02:35:16.356
ASHLEY: Is there anyone else alive?

02:35:16.356 --> 02:35:19.777
LIAM: Did anything work against it?

02:35:19.777 --> 02:35:27.635
ASHLEY: Oh, yeah that's a good question. (louder)
Was there anything that you guys could tell of

02:35:27.635 --> 02:35:33.254
your knowledge-- did anything seem to damage it or
work against it?

02:35:33.254 --> 02:35:43.598
MATT: (grunts) He seems confused about what you're
referring to. The skittering creature or the--

02:35:43.598 --> 02:35:46.029
ASHLEY: Oh. The skittering creature or the big
thing?

02:35:46.029 --> 02:35:47.736
LAURA: The skittering creatures?

02:35:47.736 --> 02:35:52.831
ASHLEY: Both, because we still have--

02:35:52.831 --> 02:35:54.726
LIAM: Against them

02:35:54.726 --> 02:35:59.894
ASHLEY: Against them! Against the skittering
creatures

02:35:59.894 --> 02:36:08.267
MATT: "The skittering creatures, we just ran. I
didn't look to see."

02:36:08.267 --> 02:36:12.942
LAURA: That's already three questions.

02:36:12.942 --> 02:36:22.380
ASHLEY: Okay. Oh god, this is not--

02:36:22.380 --> 02:36:32.065
(whispering)

02:36:32.065 --> 02:36:43.735
ASHLEY: How big were the creatures?

02:36:43.735 --> 02:37:06.418
MATT: "They were rather large, maybe eight foot
end to end. They burrow, they spit. But they were

02:37:06.418 --> 02:37:10.353
"awoken by the smaller one."

02:37:10.353 --> 02:37:12.999
ASHLEY: Wait, he said they spit?

02:37:12.999 --> 02:37:20.128
LAURA: I didn't hear, something about his spit.
What did he say?

02:37:20.128 --> 02:37:25.284
MATT: You gather, what he said was--

02:37:25.284 --> 02:37:30.478
(laughing)

02:37:30.478 --> 02:37:44.127
MATT: No, the skitterers bite, they spit. But they
were awakened by the smaller one.

02:37:44.127 --> 02:37:46.687
MARISHA: The smaller one?

02:37:46.687 --> 02:37:49.885
LAURA: What's the smaller one?!

02:37:49.885 --> 02:37:53.645
LIAM: What can you tell us of the smaller one?

02:37:53.645 --> 02:37:55.785
SAM: They spit. Maybe acid, probably.

02:37:55.785 --> 02:38:01.780
LIAM: Yeah, they're smooth, that means they were
just like (slurping noises).

02:38:01.780 --> 02:38:07.563
ASHLEY: Is there anything that you can tell us
about the smaller one?

02:38:07.563 --> 02:38:25.967
MATT: "It was like a baby, and it cried out and
everything fell around us. I barely made it out,

02:38:25.967 --> 02:38:37.630
"but the skitterers found me." (deep exhale) The
enchantment leaves that embodied the skull, falls

02:38:37.630 --> 02:38:39.860
to rest, the bones now motionless.

02:38:39.860 --> 02:38:43.129
SAM: So it can emit a cry that shakes everything.

02:38:43.129 --> 02:38:44.824
ASHLEY: A baby, like a baby?

02:38:44.824 --> 02:38:46.405
LIAM: Mandrake?

02:38:46.405 --> 02:38:48.174
MATT: I would say, Marisha--

02:38:48.174 --> 02:38:54.418
MARISHA: Does it sound like anything we have
encountered? A nature check?

02:38:54.489 --> 02:38:57.209
MATT: We'll say a nature check for both you and
Vex.

02:38:57.209 --> 02:39:00.383
MARISHA: Would I have an advantage with my little
book?

02:39:00.383 --> 02:39:05.442
MATT: Not for this in particular.

02:39:05.442 --> 02:39:07.836
LIAM: It will be like the creature back in
Stillben?

02:39:07.836 --> 02:39:09.835
LAURA: Yeah, I don't think that's what it is.

02:39:09.835 --> 02:39:13.199
LIAM: And we have heard tales of mandrakes, and
they scream.

02:39:13.274 --> 02:39:17.367
LAURA: Yeah, did the pincers sound like something
we have fought though, before?

02:39:17.367 --> 02:39:20.918
MATT: No, it's not something you've encountered before,
necessarily.

02:39:21.117 --> 02:39:22.872
MARISHA: 19?

02:39:22.872 --> 02:39:26.440
MATT: 19, okay. And Vex?

02:39:26.440 --> 02:39:27.640
LAURA: Nature check?

02:39:27.640 --> 02:39:28.683
MATT: Yeah.

02:39:28.683 --> 02:39:33.123
LAURA: Do I get advantage because I'm standing in
the woods? Six!

02:39:33.123 --> 02:39:37.768
TALIESIN: You know you're standing in the woods.

02:39:37.768 --> 02:39:44.325
MATT: You have heard of a creature that does exist
in subterranean and sometimes forested areas,

02:39:44.325 --> 02:39:48.436
referred to as an ankheg.

02:39:48.436 --> 02:39:50.832
MARISHA: An ankheg?

02:39:50.832 --> 02:39:58.953
MATT: An ankheg. They generally tend to snatch
cattle and beasts of burden in the night. They are

02:39:58.953 --> 02:40:08.833
large and insect-like. They spit an acidic fluid.
Some of the things this corpse has described makes

02:40:08.833 --> 02:40:10.288
you think of that.

02:40:10.288 --> 02:40:15.259
LIAM: Isn't that what our bug juice is made out
of?

02:40:15.259 --> 02:40:20.990
MATT: You bug juice is made of sandkheg, which is
a desert-based variant of that creature.

02:40:20.990 --> 02:40:27.316
LAURA: Oh. I wonder if we could sprinkle it around
us and they won't bother us because we'll smell

02:40:27.316 --> 02:40:28.912
like their brethren.

02:40:28.912 --> 02:40:31.221
TRAVIS: I ain't wasting that shit!

02:40:31.221 --> 02:40:33.617
LAURA: Hey, man, it's an idea.

02:40:33.617 --> 02:40:35.505
MARISHA: So they snatch cattle--

02:40:35.505 --> 02:40:38.450
SAM: So we should all be cows.

02:40:38.450 --> 02:40:42.388
MARISHA: Oh my god, you guys. Perfect
opportunity!

02:40:42.388 --> 02:40:44.958
LIAM and MARISHA: Throwback Thursday!

02:40:44.958 --> 02:40:49.645
MATT: If only the person who could cast the spell
was in your party anymore. He's elsewhere in the

02:40:49.645 --> 02:40:50.864
world right now.

02:40:50.864 --> 02:40:52.245
LIAM: That asshole.

02:40:52.245 --> 02:40:54.490
SAM: We just talked to him. He was the dead body.

02:40:54.490 --> 02:40:57.487
(groaning)

02:40:57.487 --> 02:40:59.743
MATT: All right, so what are you guys doing?

02:40:59.743 --> 02:41:05.795
SAM: Well, we're going to rest for the night, and
then go in at first light.

02:41:05.795 --> 02:41:08.437
LAURA: Yes, we definitely should have a Heroes'
Feast.

02:41:08.437 --> 02:41:12.136
MARISHA: Yeah, let's have a Heroes' Feast, which--
okay, hang on, let me check here.

02:41:12.136 --> 02:41:13.600
TRAVIS: We don't need it.

02:41:13.600 --> 02:41:15.553
MARISHA: I can do a Heroes' Feast.

02:41:15.553 --> 02:41:18.798
TALIESIN: Protection from acid would probably be
very--

02:41:18.798 --> 02:41:26.034
MARISHA: Okay, but my Wind Walk-- I already Wind
Walked, so I can do a Heroes' Feast at a higher

02:41:26.034 --> 02:41:37.433
level. I also want to do a 5th-level Commune with
Nature.

02:41:37.433 --> 02:41:46.193
MATT: Okay. 5th-level Commune with Nature.

02:41:46.193 --> 02:41:49.595
MARISHA: What should I ask? What should I ask that
we don't already know?

02:41:49.595 --> 02:41:52.824
SAM: I mean, is there any nature down there? It's
a mine. It's all rocks.

02:41:52.824 --> 02:41:58.656
MARISHA: Well, I can see in a two-, three-mile
radius.

02:41:58.656 --> 02:42:00.209
TRAVIS: How deep does the hole go?

02:42:00.209 --> 02:42:01.688
MARISHA: I was thinking that.

02:42:01.688 --> 02:42:06.742
MATT: Instantly gain knowledge of up to three
facts of your choice about any of the following

02:42:06.742 --> 02:42:12.347
subjects as they relate to the area: terrain;
bodies of water; prevalent plants, minerals,

02:42:12.347 --> 02:42:19.902
animals, or peoples; powerful celestials, fey,
fiends, elementals, or undead; influence from

02:42:19.902 --> 02:42:21.664
other planes of existence; or buildings.

02:42:21.664 --> 02:42:22.513
MARISHA: Okay.

02:42:22.513 --> 02:42:23.891
MATT: Choose three of those.

02:42:23.891 --> 02:42:27.694
MARISHA: First and foremost, influences from other
planes of existence.

02:42:27.694 --> 02:42:35.145
MATT: Okay, so as you focus and Commune with
Nature, the plants speak to you in this series of

02:42:35.145 --> 02:42:43.116
images and thoughts that essentially get the idea
across to you that there is something planar

02:42:43.116 --> 02:42:48.617
involved here, but it's very old and long-dormant,
recently awoken.

02:42:48.617 --> 02:42:58.125
MARISHA: Okay. Planar, long dormant.

02:42:58.125 --> 02:42:59.991
TALIESIN: Recently awoken.

02:42:59.991 --> 02:43:09.041
TRAVIS: If it's a fucking baby ancient dragon I'm
going to be stoked.

02:43:09.041 --> 02:43:11.424
MARISHA: Okay, so something planar.

02:43:11.424 --> 02:43:14.640
LIAM: Didn't Drez Vina send us to a fetal thing?

02:43:14.640 --> 02:43:16.834
MARISHA: Yeah, that was our first fight.

02:43:16.834 --> 02:43:19.063
SAM: Oh, we can't do how deep is the mine? No?

02:43:19.063 --> 02:43:25.766
MARISHA: No, I can, it's a terrain question, so
terrain. Yeah. How deep does this mine go?

02:43:25.766 --> 02:43:29.367
LAURA: Maybe you can ask where the thing is in the
mine.

02:43:29.367 --> 02:43:34.029
MARISHA: Is. I think I can, right? Can I sense the
location of where--?

02:43:34.029 --> 02:43:35.927
MATT: You can ask whereabouts this thing is.

02:43:35.927 --> 02:43:37.103
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:43:37.103 --> 02:43:42.850
MATT: Nature tells you this sinkhole goes down for
about a quarter-mile,

02:43:42.850 --> 02:43:46.861
and it lies at the very bottom.

02:43:46.861 --> 02:43:50.410
LAURA: It's just straight down at the bottom of
it?

02:43:50.410 --> 02:43:52.221
TRAVIS: That's 400 meters, y'all.

02:43:52.221 --> 02:43:57.277
ASHLEY: So it's like this and then the little baby
thing at the bottom?

02:43:57.277 --> 02:44:00.281
MATT: Apparently, yeah. The whole ground just
collapsed inward.

02:44:00.281 --> 02:44:04.927
MARISHA: 400 meters and the entity lies at the
bottom.

02:44:04.927 --> 02:44:08.246
SAM: We can just jump. We're like gods.

02:44:08.246 --> 02:44:09.260
MARISHA: Yeah, we're gods!

02:44:09.260 --> 02:44:10.498
TALIESIN: We're golden gods.

02:44:10.498 --> 02:44:13.339
MARISHA: It's only a little bit more than 1000
feet.

02:44:13.339 --> 02:44:18.110
LAURA: Yeah, then you might survive that one? Only
if you turn into a goldfish and fall onto the

02:44:18.157 --> 02:44:19.597
ground. It's fine.

02:44:19.597 --> 02:44:23.422
MARISHA: Now I know Looney Tune physics doesn't
work in this world.

02:44:23.422 --> 02:44:26.098
LIAM: Always go earth elemental.

02:44:26.098 --> 02:44:29.422
LAURA and MARISHA: Always Keyteor.

02:44:29.496 --> 02:44:31.516
SAM: So what's our last question?

02:44:31.516 --> 02:44:35.218
TRAVIS: Something from another plane. We know it's
400 meters down.

02:44:35.218 --> 02:44:36.659
MARISHA: It lies at the bottom.

02:44:36.659 --> 02:44:38.880
TALIESIN: How many of these creatures are there?

02:44:38.880 --> 02:44:42.409
TRAVIS: Of the crawly ones?

02:44:42.409 --> 02:44:48.520
MARISHA: Ankhegs. Can I get a sense of how many
and whereabouts the ankhegs are?

02:44:48.520 --> 02:44:50.729
MATT: One of the two.

02:44:50.729 --> 02:44:55.376
LAURA: What are ankhegs? Are they fiends?

02:44:55.376 --> 02:44:58.971
LIAM: They're beasts, probably. They're big bugs.

02:44:58.971 --> 02:45:01.322
LAURA: Aberrations?

02:45:01.322 --> 02:45:02.847
MARISHA: How many?

02:45:02.847 --> 02:45:04.674
TRAVIS: Yeah, because if there's hundreds, then--

02:45:04.674 --> 02:45:05.839
MARISHA: That's a problem.

02:45:05.839 --> 02:45:08.411
TALIESIN: Then this is a stealth mission.

02:45:08.411 --> 02:45:11.814
MATT: They are monstrosities, and that's what they
look like right there.

02:45:11.814 --> 02:45:14.923
ALL: Oh!

02:45:14.923 --> 02:45:17.135
TALIESIN: I love Starship Troopers. I'm excited.

02:45:17.135 --> 02:45:22.024
LAURA: We're about to fight some big, armored
vaginas.

02:45:22.024 --> 02:45:29.901
MARISHA: About how many? Do I know about how many
there are? Sensing their skittering movements

02:45:29.901 --> 02:45:31.416
under the surface.

02:45:31.416 --> 02:45:41.132
MATT: Using the nature's essence to let you know:
somewhere in the neighborhood of about close to a

02:45:41.132 --> 02:45:45.743
hundred. Throughout the network of caves--

02:45:45.743 --> 02:45:48.384
MARISHA: Because this is a three-mile radius,
right?

02:45:48.384 --> 02:45:53.218
MATT: Yeah, so this is spread out amongst what
would essentially be a subterranean anthill of

02:45:53.218 --> 02:45:54.677
these ankhegs.

02:45:54.677 --> 02:45:56.737
MARISHA: There's a lot.

02:45:56.737 --> 02:46:06.431
TRAVIS: We're going to need a fast exit. He wants
us to take care of what the problem was.

02:46:06.431 --> 02:46:16.222
SAM: We've just got to kill the big boss. One
little baby big boss. The boss baby.

02:46:16.222 --> 02:46:28.030
LAURA: Did we understand correctly that it's the
baby that cried out is the big monster?

02:46:28.030 --> 02:46:29.373
The big boss?

02:46:29.373 --> 02:46:31.417
MATT: It seems to be the source of where all this
started.

02:46:31.489 --> 02:46:34.370
LAURA: Okay. And that's the thing that woke up the
skitterers?

02:46:34.370 --> 02:46:38.259
MATT: Or at least brought them to start attacking
the surface.

02:46:38.259 --> 02:46:41.494
LAURA: Okay. I just wanted to make sure it wasn't
like, there's a big boss and then there's

02:46:41.494 --> 02:46:44.055
skitterers and then there's also little babies
that cry out.

02:46:44.055 --> 02:46:46.150
MATT: You don't know. This is all the information
you have.

02:46:46.150 --> 02:46:50.058
ASHLEY: But do we know why the baby woke up? What
woke the baby?

02:46:50.058 --> 02:46:52.200
LAURA: No, we don't know what woke up the baby.

02:46:52.200 --> 02:46:53.366
ASHLEY: We didn't ask that? Okay.

02:46:53.366 --> 02:46:55.271
LAURA: Maybe we should talk to another dead
person.

02:46:55.271 --> 02:46:57.401
TRAVIS: Nah.

02:46:57.401 --> 02:46:59.207
SAM and TALIESIN: I don't think they'll know.

02:46:59.207 --> 02:47:01.838
LAURA: They're not miners.

02:47:01.838 --> 02:47:07.336
ASHLEY: They did something in the mine that awoke
it. And we can redo it.

02:47:07.336 --> 02:47:11.554
TALIESIN: I think anybody who was there who saw it
probably died at the center of it.

02:47:11.554 --> 02:47:22.633
LIAM: Sorry, we're trying to remember the very
first game of D&amp;D we ever played and Keyleth,

02:47:22.633 --> 02:47:24.555
twins, Grog were there.

02:47:24.555 --> 02:47:34.274
MATT: Yeah, that's right. That was what was
essentially a dead or stillborn deity. A demigod,

02:47:34.274 --> 02:47:36.438
essentially, in its own pocket plane.

02:47:36.438 --> 02:47:39.120
MARISHA: So does it have anything to do with
this?

02:47:39.120 --> 02:47:40.784
MATT: Roll a religion check.

02:47:40.784 --> 02:47:45.526
MARISHA: No. I'm bad at this! (groans)

02:47:45.526 --> 02:47:47.352
LIAM: I'm religious!

02:47:47.352 --> 02:47:51.638
MATT: Yeah, if you want to, whoever's having this
conversation you can make a religion check.

02:47:51.638 --> 02:47:53.313
LIAM: Luck of the day. Yes!

02:47:53.313 --> 02:47:55.959
LAURA: Natural 20.

02:47:55.959 --> 02:47:56.814
MARISHA: Are you serious?

02:47:56.814 --> 02:48:00.299
LAURA: No, I haven't rolled. I'm trying to make
myself roll it.

02:48:00.299 --> 02:48:01.983
LIAM: I got a 19.

02:48:01.983 --> 02:48:04.101
LAURA: (gasps) Oh my god I rolled a natural 20!

02:48:04.101 --> 02:48:05.138
MARISHA: Shut up!

02:48:05.138 --> 02:48:06.498
TRAVIS: She really did.

02:48:06.498 --> 02:48:11.557
LAURA: It's like &lt;i&gt;Run Lola, Run&lt;/i&gt; where she's doing
the roulette thing and she's like--

02:48:11.557 --> 02:48:24.650
MATT: Okay. You recall a while back that you
battled with that entity, you-- what was it

02:48:24.650 --> 02:48:26.097
called? Crysa-Thul.

02:48:26.097 --> 02:48:29.989
LAURA: How?

02:48:29.989 --> 02:48:40.515
MATT: (sighs) This is all I do with my free time,
guys. Make up shit for fun. But that was not tiny.

02:48:40.515 --> 02:48:45.291
That was a very large entity. Like, to the point
where you remember there was a 20-foot-wide well

02:48:45.291 --> 02:48:52.436
and a giant fleshy baby arm that slapped out and
crawled it out Akira-style. Everyone kept saying

02:48:52.436 --> 02:49:00.254
small on this one, so you don't know if-- maybe
related in some way? But you're not entirely

02:49:00.254 --> 02:49:03.903
certain. It doesn't appear to be the same kind of
thing, necessarily.

02:49:03.903 --> 02:49:05.962
Not by the descriptor you've heard.

02:49:05.962 --> 02:49:08.844
LIAM: Corpse called it a small one, right?

02:49:08.844 --> 02:49:10.320
MATT: It called it a small one.

02:49:10.320 --> 02:49:15.308
TRAVIS: We're good. We've still got to camp for
the night, right?

02:49:15.308 --> 02:49:21.207
LAURA: Yeah. We're camping. But we should camp in
the trees, y'all. Not in the ground, in case the

02:49:21.207 --> 02:49:22.330
things come up out.

02:49:22.330 --> 02:49:27.391
MATT: Yeah, the thick forest of Herethis surrounds
the mine.

02:49:27.391 --> 02:49:29.112
LAURA: Oh man.

02:49:29.112 --> 02:49:34.531
MARISHA: Can I Druidcraft some web hammocks?

02:49:34.531 --> 02:49:39.016
TALIESIN: I mean you can, I mean we've gone to all
this trouble, but if we want to add to it. I mean,

02:49:39.016 --> 02:49:40.521
this is just what we've been doing.

02:49:40.521 --> 02:49:42.634
MARISHA: Look, I really like elaborate tree
houses.

02:49:42.634 --> 02:49:44.587
TALIESIN: No, I understand. I respect the art
form.

02:49:44.587 --> 02:49:47.124
MARISHA: I can have a rope bridge here.

02:49:47.124 --> 02:49:48.458
LIAM: Hammock bed.

02:49:48.458 --> 02:49:53.200
MATT: We'll say Druidcraft, which is a very
localized and cantrip-based magic, you could, over

02:49:53.200 --> 02:49:55.609
the next couple hours craft a single web hammock.

02:49:55.609 --> 02:49:57.163
(groaning)

02:49:57.163 --> 02:49:59.002
MATT: It's a cantrip, yo!

02:49:59.002 --> 02:50:04.663
MARISHA: I'll pass. We'll just sleep with the ones
we have or whatever

02:50:04.663 --> 02:50:06.197
LIAM: A third-grade diorama.

02:50:06.197 --> 02:50:14.513
MATT: Yeah. This is what it would look like if you
were to build to scale. Okay. So you guys find a

02:50:14.513 --> 02:50:18.748
place in the trees? Who's helming finding that
spot? All right. Go ahead and roll an

02:50:18.748 --> 02:50:20.703
investigation check.

02:50:20.703 --> 02:50:26.404
LAURA: 15?

02:50:26.404 --> 02:50:27.552
MATT: Okay.

02:50:27.552 --> 02:50:31.957
LAURA: Oh wait! I honestly don't know anymore what
my favored terrain does for me.

02:50:31.957 --> 02:50:35.769
MATT: No, this is exactly where to use it because
forest is your favored terrain. This is exactly

02:50:35.769 --> 02:50:37.798
the kind of thing it would help with.

02:50:37.798 --> 02:50:42.547
LAURA: I always feel like I'm bullshitting it now.
What am I rolling? Investigation?

02:50:42.547 --> 02:50:43.592
MATT: Yes.

02:50:43.592 --> 02:50:44.598
LAURA: 24.

02:50:44.598 --> 02:50:50.537
MATT: 24. You find one massive tree. The trees
here can get pretty big, and there's one thick

02:50:50.537 --> 02:50:55.349
tree that the branches are pretty easy to climb,
and up top it branches out and all the various

02:50:55.349 --> 02:51:02.038
branches that make up the canopy. It's almost like
this little bowl at the very top, just underneath

02:51:02.038 --> 02:51:07.448
where the heavy foliage descends, and it's a
perfect place for you guys to make a camp higher

02:51:07.448 --> 02:51:08.618
up off the ground.

02:51:08.618 --> 02:51:10.648
LAURA: Hey, this is a place! Let's do it here!

02:51:10.648 --> 02:51:13.218
TALIESIN: I'll unload everything.

02:51:13.218 --> 02:51:17.458
MATT: All right, you guys make camp. Who's making
first watch?

02:51:17.458 --> 02:51:18.740
TRAVIS: Me!

02:51:18.740 --> 02:51:19.822
LAURA: All right.

02:51:19.822 --> 02:51:20.912
LIAM: Me, too.

02:51:20.912 --> 02:51:22.441
ASHLEY: Oh! Heroes' Feast.

02:51:22.441 --> 02:51:23.707
LAURA and MARISHA: Heroes' Feast.

02:51:23.707 --> 02:51:31.785
MATT: All right. We'll say as a note, this the
last of the chalices you have prepared. If you

02:51:31.785 --> 02:51:35.806
want to do any more Heroes' Feasts, you'll have to
specifically go and purchase the chalices or go

02:51:35.806 --> 02:51:37.804
look for it in town.

02:51:37.804 --> 02:51:39.224
LIAM: Let's do it!

02:51:39.224 --> 02:51:41.774
MARISHA: Is this including or not including the
chalice that

02:51:41.774 --> 02:51:45.001
Grog gave to Vex earlier to drink out of?

02:51:45.001 --> 02:51:49.894
MATT: That chalice, while it looks quite
delightful, is not worth a thousand gold pieces.

02:51:49.894 --> 02:51:51.571
TALIESIN: It's from Medieval Times.

02:51:51.571 --> 02:51:53.092
MATT: (laughs) It's a little gaudy.

02:51:53.092 --> 02:51:54.893
MARISHA: It's got Michael's. Michael's crafts.

02:51:54.893 --> 02:52:01.540
MATT: Yeah, every time you drink from it you get
glitter on your hands and you're like, shit.

02:52:01.613 --> 02:52:08.341
MARISHA: How do you turn it off? Cover it in
blankets.

02:52:08.341 --> 02:52:10.151
LAURA: Yay, Heroes' Feast.

02:52:10.151 --> 02:52:11.738
SAM: We're immune to fear?

02:52:11.738 --> 02:52:13.983
MATT: You're immune to fear, immune to poison,
and--

02:52:13.983 --> 02:52:15.559
LAURA: Advantage on wisdom.

02:52:15.559 --> 02:52:17.926
MATT: Marisha, you want to go ahead and roll the
additional hit points for Heroes' Feast?

02:52:17.926 --> 02:52:19.295
MARISHA: Yeah 2d10, yeah?

02:52:19.295 --> 02:52:20.775
MATT: 2d10, I believe.

02:52:20.775 --> 02:52:23.496
LAURA: We're losing our 17?

02:52:23.496 --> 02:52:25.357
LIAM: Lose our 17 from the speech?

02:52:25.357 --> 02:52:26.216
MATT: You do.

02:52:26.216 --> 02:52:28.154
TRAVIS: That's why I didn't take them.

02:52:28.154 --> 02:52:33.107
MARISHA: (gasps) Ooh! Wait, yeah! Ooh, that's
amazing! It's a nine and a ten!

02:52:33.107 --> 02:52:36.129
MATT: So 19 additional hit points to all of you
guys.

02:52:36.129 --> 02:52:40.875
LAURA: If you give us a speech, how long does that
last?

02:52:40.875 --> 02:52:45.041
MATT: Temporary hit points last until they go down
or you take a long rest, I believe.

02:52:45.041 --> 02:52:46.630
Let me double check.

02:52:46.630 --> 02:52:48.305
MARISHA: But this is going to be a long rest?

02:52:48.305 --> 02:52:51.224
LAURA: Oh wait, but does that mean we lose our
temporary hit points on the Heroes' Feast?

02:52:51.224 --> 02:52:56.281
MATT: Well, no. They're different. The Heroes'
Feast is in addition to your maximum hit points.

02:52:56.281 --> 02:53:03.623
Temporary hit points are different. Technically,
those two stack. You're about to lose the

02:53:03.623 --> 02:53:04.669
temporary hit points.

02:53:04.669 --> 02:53:07.042
MARISHA: But then at the top of the morning, I can
give us another speech.

02:53:07.042 --> 02:53:08.495
MATT: Should you be so inclined, yeah.

02:53:08.495 --> 02:53:09.513
LAURA: Tight.

02:53:09.513 --> 02:53:10.985
MARISHA: Do I have to do it?

02:53:10.985 --> 02:53:12.327
TRAVIS: No, you don't. You don't.

02:53:12.327 --> 02:53:17.711
MARISHA: Fuck you, Travis. Fuck you.

02:53:17.711 --> 02:53:21.449
MATT: You can give the essence of a speech.

02:53:21.449 --> 02:53:26.408
MARISHA: Right, I can do an interpretive dance.

02:53:26.408 --> 02:53:28.220
TRAVIS: That's better.

02:53:28.220 --> 02:53:31.087
TALIESIN: Only if you actually do the interpretive
dance.

02:53:31.087 --> 02:53:32.946
ASHLEY: Wait, 19 extra?

02:53:32.946 --> 02:53:35.060
LAURA: He's giving you a look.

02:53:35.060 --> 02:53:44.139
MARISHA: A laser light show. With fireflies. It's
like in a Disney Imagineer show.

02:53:44.139 --> 02:53:45.816
MATT: It's a speech.

02:53:45.816 --> 02:53:48.166
MARISHA: All right, well, it's a speech.

02:53:48.166 --> 02:53:54.591
MATT: You can give the essence of it, but the idea
here is just you honing

02:53:54.591 --> 02:53:56.310
your public speaking skills.

02:53:56.310 --> 02:53:58.343
LAURA: You're going to get better at it, Keyleth.

02:53:58.343 --> 02:54:00.633
LIAM: It's like public debate in high school.

02:54:00.633 --> 02:54:01.911
SAM: Toastmasters.

02:54:01.911 --> 02:54:04.304
TALIESIN: I love Toastmasters.

02:54:04.304 --> 02:54:14.529
MATT: Temporary hit points. They last until
they're depleted or you finish a long rest. Yes, I

02:54:14.529 --> 02:54:16.009
was correct. Cool.

02:54:16.009 --> 02:54:17.355
MARISHA: So in the top of the morning.

02:54:17.355 --> 02:54:19.126
LAURA and MARISHA: Top o' the mornin'!

02:54:19.126 --> 02:54:24.626
MATT: All right. We'll say for the purpose of
brevity, because even at your guys' level if you

02:54:24.626 --> 02:54:31.416
did encounter anything in this forest that was
indigenous, you'd splatter it in a round. But you

02:54:31.416 --> 02:54:34.939
don't have any issues. Nothing really sees you up
in the branches. You occasionally get caught off

02:54:34.939 --> 02:54:42.665
guard by the sound of a nearby (hooting). It's an
owl in the trees. But nothing seems to bother you

02:54:42.665 --> 02:54:47.849
during your evening slumber. You complete your
long rest. You still maintain your benefits from

02:54:47.849 --> 02:54:50.741
the Heroes' Feast, and as morning comes, Keyleth
gives a rousing speech.

02:54:50.741 --> 02:54:55.476
SAM: Just give us a topic.

02:54:55.476 --> 02:54:59.311
MATT: You can just describe the topics you talk
about. You don't have to give the actual speech.

02:54:59.311 --> 02:55:11.198
MARISHA: That's great, because one can only
bullshit so much in a four-hour fucking game. I

02:55:11.198 --> 02:55:20.202
talk about the smell of our breakfast. It's bacon
in the morning. And taste and smell the fleshy

02:55:20.202 --> 02:55:22.417
essence of the pork.

02:55:22.417 --> 02:55:25.053
TALIESIN: Is bacon what we're fighting for?

02:55:25.053 --> 02:55:37.800
MARISHA: No, bacon is definitely worth fighting
for. Bacon is worth fighting for, and when we kill

02:55:37.800 --> 02:55:47.368
that celestial baby we will have the godliest
bacon one could ever imagine.

02:55:47.368 --> 02:55:49.174
SAM: I do like bacon.

02:55:49.174 --> 02:55:54.264
TALIESIN: This is the most Burning Man thing
that's ever happened on this show.

02:55:54.264 --> 02:55:58.196
I'm flashing back.

02:55:58.196 --> 02:56:02.127
MATT: Keyleth, Voice of the Tempest.

02:56:02.127 --> 02:56:05.372
TALIESIN: Bacon. Speech.

02:56:05.372 --> 02:56:08.318
MATT: All right, guys. There you go. Take your 17
temporary hit points.

02:56:08.318 --> 02:56:13.250
MARISHA: She's not a great talker and has never
been one. Just want to point that out. You guys

02:56:13.250 --> 02:56:14.591
all know this.

02:56:14.591 --> 02:56:16.120
MATT: No, it's just her level.

02:56:16.120 --> 02:56:18.954
LAURA: Just add that to the 19 then?

02:56:18.954 --> 02:56:22.192
MATT: No, because the 17, once the 17 goes it's
gone.

02:56:22.192 --> 02:56:23.541
LAURA: But the 19 we can heal to?

02:56:23.541 --> 02:56:26.572
MATT: It's still your maximum. You can heal to it,
yeah. That is the difference.

02:56:26.572 --> 02:56:33.808
TALIESIN: I always imagine occasionally Keyleth
gives a speech that's like what's-his-name from

02:56:33.808 --> 02:56:35.210
Animal House.

02:56:35.210 --> 02:56:41.414
SAM: Matthew, I'm going to prepare some spells
that I'm going to inject into various coins.

02:56:41.414 --> 02:56:42.826
MATT: Yes, what are you doing?

02:56:42.826 --> 02:56:49.012
SAM: I'm going to drop another 300 gold and give
Vex another Revivify.

02:56:49.012 --> 02:56:50.677
MATT: Okay.

02:56:50.677 --> 02:56:55.595
SAM: Grog, you're already a good jumper, right?

02:56:55.595 --> 02:56:56.936
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:56:56.936 --> 02:56:59.031
SAM: How far can you jump?

02:56:59.031 --> 02:57:02.661
TRAVIS: You gave me a Fly coin.

02:57:02.661 --> 02:57:08.699
SAM: No, that's gone forever. That's gone. It
doesn't last forever. It lasts a couple hours.

02:57:08.699 --> 02:57:16.631
TRAVIS: Well, that's bullshit. Yeah, I can jump 15
feet vertically or 20 feet horizontally. So not

02:57:16.631 --> 02:57:18.664
great. Like three squares.

02:57:18.664 --> 02:57:23.712
SAM: I'll give you a Jump coin, so that will
triple your jump.

02:57:23.712 --> 02:57:28.328
TRAVIS: Will you sing "Jump" from Van Halen?

02:57:28.328 --> 02:57:35.931
SAM: Sure. When you do it. Let's see here. Who
needs things?

02:57:35.931 --> 02:57:39.628
ASHLEY: (singing) Jump! For my love.

02:57:39.628 --> 02:57:43.106
SAM: Oh no, you guys all cast things now, right?

02:57:43.106 --> 02:57:45.009
TALIESIN: Not really, why?

02:57:45.009 --> 02:57:50.363
LIAM: T., give me something! Show me some magic.
Give me a doodad.

02:57:50.363 --> 02:57:52.036
SAM: Can you turn invisible?

02:57:52.036 --> 02:57:54.056
LIAM: I used to be able to, but I--

02:57:54.056 --> 02:57:55.452
SAM: You gave away your ring.

02:57:55.452 --> 02:58:02.100
LAURA: Kerr bear. Oh no, it wasn't Kerr bear. It
was Tova.

02:58:02.100 --> 02:58:04.792
SAM: I'll give you a Blur coin.

02:58:04.792 --> 02:58:07.677
LAURA: Don't you already have that with your--

02:58:07.677 --> 02:58:10.123
LIAM: That cloak that I gave away?

02:58:10.123 --> 02:58:11.611
LAURA: Oh yeah, that one.

02:58:11.611 --> 02:58:12.920
MARISHA: That's the one that Kerr bear took.

02:58:12.920 --> 02:58:14.360
LIAM and LAURA: That's right.

02:58:14.360 --> 02:58:17.681
MATT: Yeah. (laughs) The inventory of the items
you've lost to guests.

02:58:17.681 --> 02:58:19.410
LIAM: Lost? Gave away.

02:58:19.410 --> 02:58:20.939
MATT: Lost and gave away.

02:58:20.939 --> 02:58:26.390
SAM: I'll give good old Percival a Cure Wounds
coin.

02:58:26.390 --> 02:58:27.955
MATT: What level?

02:58:27.955 --> 02:58:29.627
SAM: Just one.

02:58:29.627 --> 02:58:30.893
MATT: Level one. You got it.

02:58:30.893 --> 02:58:33.914
TALIESIN: Yeah. It will hopefully not come in
handy.

02:58:33.914 --> 02:58:41.334
SAM: And also I'm going to change my Robe of Many
Things to my new Robe of Many Things.

02:58:41.334 --> 02:58:43.331
MATT: Okay.

02:58:43.331 --> 02:58:44.732
SAM: And that's it.

02:58:44.732 --> 02:58:46.793
TALIESIN: A Vest of Several Items now.

02:58:46.793 --> 02:58:52.775
MATT: (laughs) The Kigurumi of Useful Trinkets.

02:58:52.775 --> 02:58:56.843
LAURA: Oh, hey. Well, no. Maybe would this be a
bad idea?

02:58:56.843 --> 02:58:59.933
To shoot an Oracle Arrow down into the bottom?

02:58:59.933 --> 02:59:08.375
TALIESIN: I think that's been working out very
well for us. It is pitch black down there,

02:59:08.375 --> 02:59:09.762
though, isn't it?

02:59:09.762 --> 02:59:16.897
LAURA: Well. We have this method that we used to
do. Light the arrow on fire, and then send it

02:59:16.897 --> 02:59:20.033
down. So I can see by the light of the fire on
it.

02:59:20.033 --> 02:59:21.862
LIAM: Would that make your actual eyeballs burn?

02:59:21.862 --> 02:59:23.052
LAURA: I don't think so.

02:59:23.052 --> 02:59:29.125
SAM: Oh! And I'm going to do one more thing. I'm
going to pull out a healing draught bottle, and

02:59:29.125 --> 02:59:31.833
give it to-- no, you can heal things.

02:59:31.833 --> 02:59:34.672
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm all right.

02:59:34.672 --> 02:59:35.870
SAM: You don't need to heal.

02:59:35.870 --> 02:59:37.935
TRAVIS: Other people, I normally do.

02:59:37.935 --> 02:59:39.304
SAM: I give it to Vax.

02:59:39.304 --> 02:59:42.108
TRAVIS: I turn into Nurse Betty almost in every
fight. What are you talking about?

02:59:42.108 --> 02:59:43.861
TALIESIN: Yeah, that's actually true.

02:59:43.861 --> 02:59:46.164
LAURA: That's true, he does. He does heal people a
lot.

02:59:46.164 --> 02:59:49.016
TRAVIS: But that's cool, you give it to somebody
that, you know--

02:59:49.016 --> 02:59:51.879
LIAM: Well, he can give it to me. I've got 50
things I can do a turn.

02:59:51.879 --> 02:59:53.618
It was what kind of potion?

02:59:53.618 --> 02:59:57.120
SAM: A healing draught. It's not a potion; it's a
bottle of healing shit.

02:59:57.120 --> 02:59:58.425
LIAM: Oh shit.

02:59:58.425 --> 02:59:59.617
SAM: It's 8d8.

02:59:59.617 --> 03:00:01.805
ASHLEY and LIAM: 8d8?!

03:00:01.805 --> 03:00:07.628
LIAM: I will never give this up. Ever. Thank you.
Thank you, Taryon.

03:00:07.628 --> 03:00:09.441
SAM: Sure.

03:00:09.441 --> 03:00:14.956
TALIESIN: I think that that's a really good idea,
shooting an arrow down there.

03:00:15.043 --> 03:00:18.976
LIAM: I'm going to set the Deathwalker's Ward to
necrotic.

03:00:18.976 --> 03:00:26.376
MARISHA: I'll light my hands on fire so that Vex
can light her arrows on fire.

03:00:26.376 --> 03:00:30.532
TALIESIN: So when we're ready we've got something
to light the--

03:00:30.532 --> 03:00:36.447
LAURA: Wait, should I cast Pass Without a Trace on
us? No, I'm going to do the Oracle Arrow first.

03:00:36.447 --> 03:00:39.658
Oh. What if we wake it up when I shoot it down and
things come out?

03:00:39.658 --> 03:00:42.344
LIAM: Well, that is a very real possibility.

03:00:42.344 --> 03:00:45.156
TALIESIN: Well, then they'll be easier to kill up
here than they will be down there.

03:00:45.156 --> 03:00:50.145
MARISHA: They'll be 400 meters down. I could
theoretically drop some awesome Fireballs on their

03:00:50.221 --> 03:00:51.268
face, potentially.

03:00:51.268 --> 03:00:55.770
LAURA: I like this idea. I'm going to cast Pass
Without a Trace on all of us, just to be safe. So

03:00:55.770 --> 03:01:00.610
we can stealth and be quiet. Yeah, but they'll
just keep falling, won't they?

03:01:00.610 --> 03:01:02.664
MARISHA: I don't know.

03:01:02.664 --> 03:01:04.241
LAURA: How does that work?

03:01:04.241 --> 03:01:05.987
MARISHA: That's a weird magic question.

03:01:05.987 --> 03:01:07.727
TALIESIN: This is why magic freaks me out.

03:01:07.727 --> 03:01:09.360
MATT: What's the question?

03:01:09.360 --> 03:01:14.550
MARISHA: If I drop a Fireball, how long it'll
go--

03:01:14.550 --> 03:01:16.673
LIAM: Does gravity continue to carry it down?

03:01:16.673 --> 03:01:18.419
MATT: Drop a what? A Fireball?

03:01:18.419 --> 03:01:22.478
TALIESIN: Fire a Fireball into the abyss. Will it
just eventually stop?

03:01:22.478 --> 03:01:24.172
MARISHA: Will it keep going?

03:01:24.172 --> 03:01:31.271
MATT: Well, a Fireball is a small bead of magic
energy that has a range. So if it reaches the end

03:01:31.271 --> 03:01:32.778
of the range, it has no effect.

03:01:32.778 --> 03:01:35.122
TALIESIN: This is why magic's weird.

03:01:35.122 --> 03:01:37.022
MARISHA: But I could Keyteor to the bottom.

03:01:37.022 --> 03:01:38.175
MATT: You could.

03:01:38.175 --> 03:01:40.577
TRAVIS: We're just spoiled for choice.

03:01:40.577 --> 03:01:43.031
MATT: You take half bludgeoning damage when you
impact.

03:01:43.031 --> 03:01:44.656
MARISHA: Yep, advantages to both.

03:01:44.656 --> 03:01:47.031
LIAM: Dropping a great height did not go well for
you.

03:01:47.031 --> 03:01:51.375
TRAVIS: Keyleth, did you roll 17 or 19 on your--

03:01:51.375 --> 03:01:55.418
MARISHA: I rolled 19, but then you get an
additional 17 because

03:01:55.418 --> 03:01:59.417
my weird speech about bacon.

03:01:59.417 --> 03:02:04.224
MATT: Bacon points. 17 bacon points.

03:02:04.224 --> 03:02:07.653
LAURA: It will make the most glorious bacon!

03:02:07.653 --> 03:02:10.616
MATT: To be fair, I've eaten some bacon in my time
that's given me some temporary hit points.

03:02:10.616 --> 03:02:12.520
Just saying.

03:02:12.520 --> 03:02:16.379
MARISHA: Look, it was inspired, okay?

03:02:16.379 --> 03:02:17.736
MATT: Oh, completely.

03:02:17.736 --> 03:02:19.074
MARISHA: I'm not wrong.

03:02:19.074 --> 03:02:21.569
LIAM: We will not go bacon-less into the night.

03:02:21.569 --> 03:02:24.652
MARISHA: Bacon has saved many a people.

03:02:24.652 --> 03:02:33.218
LAURA: All right. I'm setting my arrow on fire,
and I'm shooting it down into the pit.

03:02:33.218 --> 03:02:40.438
MATT: Okay. Oracle Arrow. You fire it. It's a big
pit. The radius of a small flame on an arrow

03:02:40.438 --> 03:02:47.661
doesn't seem to light up the walls. It's not
bright enough, so it just descends and descends,

03:02:47.661 --> 03:02:55.785
and the wood is catching and burning, and
eventually it hits the stony, earthy floor at the

03:02:55.785 --> 03:03:01.231
bottom (arrow impact) and it clatters and breaks a
little bit. It's burning pretty heavily, and you

03:03:01.231 --> 03:03:06.498
glance around the space inside and you can see
what looks like some broken mining equipment on

03:03:06.498 --> 03:03:12.474
the ground, jutting out in places. You see what
appears to be some sort of stony platform that is

03:03:12.474 --> 03:03:23.260
carved, but mildly forgotten or eroded steps, and
the rest of the arrow burns up

03:03:23.260 --> 03:03:25.358
and you lose your vision.

03:03:25.358 --> 03:03:27.918
LAURA: That was helpful. Super helpful.

03:03:27.918 --> 03:03:33.320
TALIESIN: Worth it. It was worth it. It didn't
cost us anything.

03:03:33.320 --> 03:03:37.519
LAURA: That's true. I didn't see the great baby
beast down at the bottom.

03:03:37.519 --> 03:03:40.583
TALIESIN: And that's information we didn't have.
And now we know.

03:03:40.583 --> 03:03:43.173
Great baby beast is not at the bottom--

03:03:43.173 --> 03:03:45.523
LAURA: Potentially. In that small circle.

03:03:45.523 --> 03:03:47.449
TALIESIN: It's not at the bottom of the topless
pit.

03:03:47.449 --> 03:03:58.360
LAURA: Okay, so we could take the flying carpet down. A
couple of people could fly. We can take the flying

03:03:58.360 --> 03:03:59.685
carpet down.

03:03:59.685 --> 03:04:01.785
TALIESIN: Two flyers, plus the carpet.

03:04:01.785 --> 03:04:06.079
TRAVIS: The circumference of this thing is
massive. The diameter.

03:04:06.079 --> 03:04:09.540
MATT: Well, the diameter of the actual hole is
maybe about--

03:04:09.540 --> 03:04:14.381
TRAVIS: Football field?

03:04:14.381 --> 03:04:21.767
MATT: Not quite that big. I'd say it's about 150,
200 feet across?

03:04:21.767 --> 03:04:24.800
TRAVIS: Stay away from the walls.

03:04:24.800 --> 03:04:29.934
LAURA: You think? The skitterers are going to come
out of the walls?

03:04:29.934 --> 03:04:32.787
TRAVIS: Yeah, do not come anywhere near the
walls.

03:04:32.787 --> 03:04:38.842
SAM: When we descend, do we want light to be able
to see? Or we don't want things to see us?

03:04:38.842 --> 03:04:42.488
LIAM: Good chance they can see in the dark.

03:04:42.488 --> 03:04:46.351
TALIESIN: Let's have the flashlights ready, but
not activated.

03:04:46.351 --> 03:04:48.483
MARISHA: I mean, I have a few Daylight spells.

03:04:48.531 --> 03:04:53.255
LAURA: It may be good to blind them if they dwell
under the surface.

03:04:53.255 --> 03:04:58.393
TRAVIS: You know, if we're not in a rush--
(deeper) if we're not in a rush, it might just be

03:04:58.393 --> 03:05:02.626
nice to send a little mini nuke down into the hole
and see what comes out.

03:05:02.626 --> 03:05:03.995
TALIESIN: Did your voice just crack?

03:05:03.995 --> 03:05:05.702
TRAVIS: Yeah, no, it's like reverse puberty.

03:05:05.702 --> 03:05:07.326
TALIESIN: Becoming a man? Okay.

03:05:07.326 --> 03:05:14.402
MARISHA: I'm down with that mini nuke. It extends
a lot of our magical ranges, unless I want to

03:05:14.402 --> 03:05:16.251
Keyteor down.

03:05:16.251 --> 03:05:21.531
TALIESIN: I think it's better, especially-- have
we seen a tree that we can port to in case of an

03:05:21.531 --> 03:05:23.974
emergency? Or some sort of object that we can port
to?

03:05:23.974 --> 03:05:26.246
MARISHA: There are definitely a lot of trees,
yeah.

03:05:26.246 --> 03:05:29.102
TALIESIN: But there will not be a tree down
there.

03:05:29.102 --> 03:05:30.366
LAURA and MATT: No.

03:05:30.366 --> 03:05:33.569
TALIESIN: Do we have an escape route if we need
it?

03:05:33.569 --> 03:05:41.395
LAURA: We have a flying carpet, two brooms, a set
of wings. Up and out.

03:05:41.395 --> 03:05:43.143
TALIESIN: Well, all right.

03:05:43.143 --> 03:05:46.208
TRAVIS: Just a reminder that I can't ride the
carpet.

03:05:46.208 --> 03:05:48.122
LAURA: Yes, you can.

03:05:48.122 --> 03:05:49.300
LIAM: It's a big one.

03:05:49.300 --> 03:05:50.774
TRAVIS: Is it? Is it bigger than the first one?

03:05:50.774 --> 03:05:52.581
TALIESIN: Yeah, it's bigger than the first one.

03:05:52.581 --> 03:05:54.123
TRAVIS: So I can get on there with everybody
else?

03:05:54.123 --> 03:06:00.348
LAURA: The only people we need to get on it are
Percy and Pike. Everybody else can fly. Unless

03:06:00.348 --> 03:06:01.662
Keyleth is out of--

03:06:01.662 --> 03:06:04.125
MARISHA: Well, I can Polymorph him.

03:06:04.125 --> 03:06:08.452
TALIESIN: How much weight can the carpet take?

03:06:08.452 --> 03:06:12.804
ASHLEY: I mean, you could technically just go on
it alone and I could--

03:06:12.804 --> 03:06:14.040
LAURA: Hop on the broom.

03:06:14.040 --> 03:06:15.738
LIAM: We are versatile as shit.

03:06:15.738 --> 03:06:17.710
ASHLEY: Hop on Vax's back.

03:06:17.710 --> 03:06:20.922
MATT: Okay, the flying carpet, the one that you
have? 800 pound capacity.

03:06:20.922 --> 03:06:22.055
TRAVIS: Okay.

03:06:22.055 --> 03:06:23.351
SAM: It's you, right?

03:06:23.351 --> 03:06:25.834
TALIESIN: You're 300 pounds, right?

03:06:25.834 --> 03:06:30.886
TRAVIS: No, I'm... it's arguable. I'm definitely
over 300.

03:06:30.886 --> 03:06:37.539
TALIESIN: Okay, so three of us on that carpet: one
big one, one little one, and a medium.

03:06:37.539 --> 03:06:39.603
MATT: You can fit Grog and one other person.

03:06:39.603 --> 03:06:41.213
TRAVIS: He's a big bastard.

03:06:41.213 --> 03:06:42.748
SAM: We can take someone on a broom.

03:06:42.748 --> 03:06:43.863
LAURA: Yeah.

03:06:43.927 --> 03:06:45.149
TALIESIN: I'll join you on the broom.

03:06:45.149 --> 03:06:46.364
LAURA: All right.

03:06:46.364 --> 03:06:49.666
MATT: I think you could probably fit Grog, Percy,
and Pike.

03:06:49.666 --> 03:06:51.864
TALIESIN: Yeah, okay then. That solves it.

03:06:51.864 --> 03:06:55.702
SAM: Well, then let's descend slowly and quietly?
Is that what we're doing?

03:06:55.702 --> 03:07:00.932
MARISHA: Hang on. Before we go, there's a few
things I want to do. Let me double-check-- I don't

03:07:00.932 --> 03:07:02.434
want to be a dumbass.

03:07:02.434 --> 03:07:05.088
TALIESIN: No, this is very clever. I see what
you're going for.

03:07:05.088 --> 03:07:14.188
MARISHA: Hang on. Wait. I might need the book.
Okay, one of the things I want to do is I want to

03:07:14.188 --> 03:07:21.181
use my staff to create an air elemental? So I want
to take a minute to use my

03:07:21.181 --> 03:07:26.633
Spire to conjure an air elemental.

03:07:26.633 --> 03:07:31.675
MATT: Conjure an air elemental.

03:07:31.675 --> 03:07:39.079
SAM: By the way, can I just remind everyone, this
whole year I've had one half of a communications

03:07:39.079 --> 03:07:42.706
bracelet and someone's been watching us the whole
time.

03:07:42.706 --> 03:07:43.791
TRAVIS: What?

03:07:43.791 --> 03:07:45.185
SAM: Remember that thing I found?

03:07:45.185 --> 03:07:47.182
LAURA: Because you got that down in the fucking
Nine Hells, right?

03:07:47.182 --> 03:07:50.015
SAM: Yeah. Someone's watching us. For a year.

03:07:50.015 --> 03:07:51.913
TALIESIN: Oh my god, they're right there.

03:07:51.913 --> 03:07:53.112
LAURA: That is so crazy.

03:07:53.112 --> 03:07:54.216
MARISHA: What?

03:07:54.216 --> 03:07:59.960
TRAVIS: Yeah, watching you make fucking blondies.
All right, this channel's boring.

03:07:59.960 --> 03:08:01.689
TALIESIN: The blondie channel.

03:08:01.689 --> 03:08:03.952
TRAVIS: He's making armor. Ugh.

03:08:03.952 --> 03:08:06.283
LIAM: (guttural, growly) I want a blondie so bad!

03:08:06.283 --> 03:08:15.571
MARISHA: I'm going to conjure an air elemental,
and then I'm going to go over to Grog and I'm

03:08:15.571 --> 03:08:27.416
going to give him a big hug and say, for the next
hour, no one can keep a hold of you. And I'm going

03:08:27.416 --> 03:08:29.767
to give him Freedom of Movement.

03:08:29.767 --> 03:08:31.733
TRAVIS: What is that?

03:08:31.733 --> 03:08:37.279
TALIESIN: Target should now spend five feet of
movement to automatically escape from non-magical

03:08:37.279 --> 03:08:40.454
restraints such as manacles or creatures that have
grapple.

03:08:40.454 --> 03:08:41.864
MARISHA: You can't be grappled.

03:08:41.864 --> 03:08:44.171
TRAVIS: So I just spend five feet of my movement?

03:08:44.171 --> 03:08:51.615
MARISHA: You're also unaffected by difficult
terrain. And spells and other magical effects can

03:08:51.615 --> 03:08:56.784
neither reduce the target's speed nor cause the
target to be paralyzed or restrained.

03:08:56.784 --> 03:08:58.544
TALIESIN: You are parkour.

03:08:58.544 --> 03:08:59.836
MARISHA: You're parkour.

03:08:59.836 --> 03:09:01.482
TRAVIS: I'm Chevy Chase in Christmas Vacation.

03:09:01.482 --> 03:09:04.673
MARISHA: Because I feel like you've been
restrained a lot.

03:09:04.673 --> 03:09:07.682
MATT: As you finish the conjuration with the staff
and slam it into the ground at the edge of the

03:09:07.682 --> 03:09:13.817
entranceway, you watch as a nearby cloud starts to
swirl and descend, and you hear this cracking

03:09:13.817 --> 03:09:20.174
sound as the planar shift between your plane and
the Elemental Plane of Air briefly hiccups open

03:09:20.174 --> 03:09:24.722
and then summons forth an air elemental that
(whoosh) rushes down under your control. It is

03:09:24.722 --> 03:09:26.224
concentration. Keep that in mind.

03:09:26.224 --> 03:09:27.412
MARISHA: Yes.

03:09:27.412 --> 03:09:28.699
MATT: All righty.

03:09:28.699 --> 03:09:29.944
TALIESIN: Let's go.

03:09:29.944 --> 03:09:31.134
TRAVIS: Do it.

03:09:31.134 --> 03:09:37.479
MATT: So. Two brooms of flying, magic carpet,
wings.

03:09:37.479 --> 03:09:40.926
LAURA and TALIESIN: (singing) And a partridge in a
pear tree.

03:09:40.926 --> 03:09:42.903
MATT: And you are...

03:09:42.903 --> 03:09:49.469
MARISHA: I know. I'm wondering if I should ahead
and go elemental, but I can't cast. Can I get on

03:09:49.469 --> 03:09:51.139
the carpet? Is there room?

03:09:51.139 --> 03:09:52.511
MATT: The carpet's full.

03:09:52.511 --> 03:09:54.941
TALIESIN: I'll hop on the broom. You hop on the
carpet.

03:09:54.941 --> 03:09:57.987
MATT: Okay, we can do that. All right, so you guys
slowly begin to descend down

03:09:57.987 --> 03:10:01.780
this heavy, open tunnel.

03:10:01.780 --> 03:10:04.420
LAURA: This is just the stupidest. We're sticking
to the middle.

03:10:04.420 --> 03:10:07.466
MARISHA: Did you cast Pass Without a Trace?

03:10:07.466 --> 03:10:11.890
MATT: Yes. So I would like all you guys to make a
stealth check, please.

03:10:11.953 --> 03:10:13.980
TRAVIS: Natural 20.

03:10:13.980 --> 03:10:19.222
LAURA: Oh shit! Flying carpet! Ooh, shit, and add
ten, y'all.

03:10:19.222 --> 03:10:20.719
TALIESIN: 27.

03:10:20.719 --> 03:10:22.014
SAM: 21.

03:10:22.014 --> 03:10:24.529
LIAM: I rolled a two, but it's a 37.

03:10:24.529 --> 03:10:26.291
ASHLEY: That's ridiculous.

03:10:26.291 --> 03:10:27.800
LAURA: 39.

03:10:27.800 --> 03:10:30.287
LIAM: Built into the rules, man!

03:10:30.287 --> 03:10:34.810
MATT: Yep, reliable rogues, man. That's what
rogues are good at.

03:10:34.810 --> 03:10:36.678
MARISHA: 37.

03:10:36.678 --> 03:10:38.225
ASHLEY: 28!

03:10:38.225 --> 03:10:39.324
TRAVIS: 30.

03:10:39.324 --> 03:10:45.075
MATT: 30, okay! As you guys all descend, you get
about halfway down the tunnel, and you can hear

03:10:45.075 --> 03:10:51.072
this occasional echo (clicking). And for those of
you that have Darkvision, you look off to the side

03:10:51.072 --> 03:10:58.506
and you see there are these small openings, these
tunnels in the sides, and occasionally you see a

03:10:58.506 --> 03:11:05.395
large insect-like creature skitter out (clicking)
and then into another hole. None seem to see or

03:11:05.395 --> 03:11:11.052
notice your presence. You continue delving deeper
and deeper and deeper. Looking up above, you can

03:11:11.052 --> 03:11:23.342
see the slowly vanishing circle of daylight above
you, and as you continue further and further down,

03:11:23.342 --> 03:11:31.223
those of you with Darkvision, you begin to see a
floor begin to approach.

03:11:31.223 --> 03:11:33.309
SAM: Don't land?

03:11:33.309 --> 03:11:34.940
LAURA: Don't land.

03:11:34.940 --> 03:11:36.322
SAM: Do we need light?

03:11:36.322 --> 03:11:41.511
TRAVIS: No, not yet. I halt the carpet 20 feet off
the ground.

03:11:41.511 --> 03:11:43.139
MATT: Okay. You halt the carpet.

03:11:43.139 --> 03:11:47.000
LAURA: And we're whispering. We're whispering, but
we're not whispering so that people can hear.

03:11:47.000 --> 03:11:49.720
We're definitely whispering over--

03:11:49.720 --> 03:11:55.707
ASHLEY: Can we see any little creature in the
middle of anything?

03:11:55.707 --> 03:11:57.957
MATT: Make a perception check.

03:11:57.957 --> 03:12:00.098
LAURA: Can I look, too?

03:12:00.098 --> 03:12:07.402
SAM: I have some sort of a cloak over my helm,
since it emits light always.

03:12:07.402 --> 03:12:14.709
MATT: Okay. It doesn't block all the light because
it's the Helm of Brilliance. As you guys are being

03:12:14.709 --> 03:12:20.015
somewhat stealthy going down here, Taryon is still
a slight beacon of fire. His helmet just emits a

03:12:20.015 --> 03:12:21.669
glow at all times.

03:12:21.669 --> 03:12:27.479
TRAVIS: Cool. Because insects don't love lights in
the dark.

03:12:27.479 --> 03:12:29.576
MARISHA: I know.

03:12:29.576 --> 03:12:31.691
ASHLEY: 25 for perception.

03:12:31.691 --> 03:12:32.856
LAURA: 22.

03:12:32.856 --> 03:12:39.096
MATT: Okay. You glance about and you can see this
opening at the bottom. There's some warping to the

03:12:39.096 --> 03:12:44.409
earth here. It's one large chamber that's almost
peanut-shaped, it pinches in the center and closes

03:12:44.453 --> 03:12:49.964
around, and there's a small tunnel that leads off
and then closes at the end. It appears to be what

03:12:49.964 --> 03:12:53.835
may have been some sort of mine shaft that has
then collapsed on the opposite side, but the

03:12:53.835 --> 03:13:03.283
center here looks like there's some fallen barrels
and chest pieces, and there are pieces of rods and

03:13:03.283 --> 03:13:09.849
rope and cords strewn about. And there's this
ancient stone platform that rises up in the

03:13:09.849 --> 03:13:15.835
center, and what appears to be some sort of a
small recess in the stonework there. It looks like

03:13:15.835 --> 03:13:20.856
it's the size of a football carved downward.

03:13:20.856 --> 03:13:28.074
SAM: I was wrong. It only emits light when there's
undead around.

03:13:28.074 --> 03:13:29.357
MATT: Oh.

03:13:29.357 --> 03:13:33.275
LAURA: Is it emitting light? Is it like an orc?

03:13:33.275 --> 03:13:35.263
MATT: It is currently not emitting light.

03:13:35.263 --> 03:13:37.672
LAURA: Should we just nuke it? Should we just nuke
that thing?

03:13:37.672 --> 03:13:41.586
TRAVIS: The ancient platform? No, don't do that.

03:13:41.586 --> 03:13:44.020
LAURA: Oh, it was like a coffin. Does it look like
a coffin?

03:13:44.020 --> 03:13:47.330
MATT: You could probably get closer.

03:13:47.330 --> 03:13:48.770
TALIESIN: Let's get a little closer.

03:13:48.770 --> 03:13:50.089
LAURA: A teeny bit.

03:13:50.089 --> 03:13:53.495
MATT: Okay. Because you're a ways from it and you
have no light down here. Even with your

03:13:53.495 --> 03:14:03.685
Darkvision, you can make out some details. The
closer you get, you see a number of small carvings

03:14:03.685 --> 03:14:07.980
in what looks like some sort of language that I
don't believe you understand.

03:14:07.980 --> 03:14:09.314
TALIESIN: Celestial?

03:14:09.314 --> 03:14:11.571
MATT: You don't see it. It's pitch-black for you,
Mr. Human.

03:14:11.571 --> 03:14:13.053
LAURA: Abyssal? Draconic?

03:14:13.128 --> 03:14:14.040
MATT: Nope.

03:14:14.040 --> 03:14:15.069
MARISHA: Primordial?

03:14:15.069 --> 03:14:16.397
MATT: Nope.

03:14:16.397 --> 03:14:18.265
TRAVIS: Common.

03:14:18.265 --> 03:14:20.638
MATT: Nope!

03:14:20.638 --> 03:14:22.781
TALIESIN: That would be amazing.

03:14:22.781 --> 03:14:24.608
ASHLEY: Dwarvish. Gnomish.

03:14:24.608 --> 03:14:25.776
MATT: Nope.

03:14:25.776 --> 03:14:26.760
TRAVIS: Giant?

03:14:26.760 --> 03:14:28.911
LAURA: Yeah, they're human. They can't see shit.

03:14:28.911 --> 03:14:32.860
MATT: The humans are sitting there in pitch black,
seeing this tiny little bead of light above and

03:14:32.860 --> 03:14:36.527
just hoping that someone's going to give them some
indicator.

03:14:36.527 --> 03:14:48.624
LAURA: Should we cast some light down here?

03:14:48.624 --> 03:14:54.955
SAM: Sure. We said that we had prepared our
flashlights before, didn't we?

03:14:54.955 --> 03:14:59.928
TALIESIN: Oh, we have that low-light version! We
have the red-light version of it.

03:14:59.928 --> 03:15:03.220
SAM: Yes, we do. I'm going to mark off two of
these.

03:15:03.283 --> 03:15:06.313
LIAM: I can get around very fast. Why don't I go
look?

03:15:06.313 --> 03:15:08.674
SAM: You want to borrow a flashlight?

03:15:08.674 --> 03:15:10.421
LIAM: I have a flashlight.

03:15:10.421 --> 03:15:13.018
TALIESIN: You don't speak Celestial.

03:15:13.018 --> 03:15:14.664
MARISHA: I can also just cast Daylight, by the
by.

03:15:14.732 --> 03:15:18.033
SAM: Well, that's what we have going in our
flashlights, are Daylight spells.

03:15:18.033 --> 03:15:20.836
TALIESIN: Except they're lensed and contained.

03:15:20.836 --> 03:15:23.129
MATT: It's contained, but it's still a single
beam.

03:15:23.129 --> 03:15:25.145
TALIESIN: A beam of red light.

03:15:25.145 --> 03:15:29.669
MATT: So you go ahead and get close on the broom.

03:15:29.669 --> 03:15:32.819
TALIESIN: And just start to see if I can make out
what it is.

03:15:32.819 --> 03:15:39.287
MATT: Right. You open up the hood of the light,
and it immediately beams this stark red beam down

03:15:39.287 --> 03:15:41.496
on this portion, and you look at it. It is
Celestial.

03:15:41.496 --> 03:15:43.261
TALIESIN: What does it say?

03:15:43.261 --> 03:15:57.940
MATT: It appears to be runes of gestation and
protection. It speaks of a seed, a guardian for

03:15:57.940 --> 03:16:00.994
ages to come: Symphior.

03:16:00.994 --> 03:16:03.276
ALL: Symphior.

03:16:03.276 --> 03:16:12.849
TALIESIN: It's an incubator. This isn't a coffin.
It hatched.

03:16:12.849 --> 03:16:17.431
ASHLEY: So this is the opening of-- this is where
it was.

03:16:17.431 --> 03:16:19.581
LIAM: Is it a guard cherub?

03:16:19.581 --> 03:16:26.202
MATT: You notice as this pale white light begins
to slowly appear a little ways ahead of you in the

03:16:26.202 --> 03:16:29.877
other side of the chamber. This light is emanating
from some--

03:16:29.877 --> 03:16:33.293
TALIESIN: I snuff. The second.

03:16:33.293 --> 03:16:35.229
LAURA: And we back away from the thing.

03:16:35.229 --> 03:16:40.811
MATT: You guys begin to drift back on the carpet,
and you see this beacon of light hovering maybe

03:16:40.811 --> 03:16:46.643
ten feet up off the ground, about the same height
that you guys were to the platform. And you see

03:16:46.643 --> 03:16:57.146
there what appears to be a cherub. It's a baby, or
an infant, but it appears to be withered and gray,

03:16:57.146 --> 03:17:02.542
and its arms and legs hang limply, and it has
these small, white angel-like wings, but the

03:17:02.542 --> 03:17:09.221
feathers are tattered and broken in places, and
the head's lolled back, and as the glow grows from

03:17:09.221 --> 03:17:18.840
it, it goes (wheezes, screams) and gives out this
heinous scream that echoes throughout the whole

03:17:18.840 --> 03:17:22.759
hall. You can't help but instinctually grab your
ears. I would like you all to make a wisdom saving

03:17:22.759 --> 03:17:23.950
throw, please.

03:17:23.950 --> 03:17:26.125
LAURA: Advantage on!

03:17:26.125 --> 03:17:32.544
MATT: Which, actually, you are immune to fear, so
it does not affect you. However, it shakes the

03:17:32.544 --> 03:17:38.867
interior and you watch as small stones (thud)
hitting the ground around you. You guys, looking

03:17:38.867 --> 03:17:44.958
up above, you can see that this scream is
affecting the structure a little bit. I need you

03:17:44.958 --> 03:17:47.142
all to roll initiative.

03:17:47.142 --> 03:17:51.290
MARISHA: Oh, that's good!

03:17:51.290 --> 03:17:54.862
SAM: Oh, that sucks.

03:17:54.862 --> 03:17:56.658
LAURA: Oh shit.

03:17:56.658 --> 03:18:00.115
MATT: So we have, up here by the platform.

03:18:00.115 --> 03:18:10.637
LIAM: I rolled a 20 on the wisdom save we didn't
need to make, and threw it away, and thought,

03:18:10.637 --> 03:18:13.498
"well, I wanted to keep it," and then I rolled
again and I got another natural 20.

03:18:13.498 --> 03:18:15.026
MARISHA: Oh shit.

03:18:15.026 --> 03:18:17.087
SAM: Whoa, look at that! There's a map.

03:18:17.087 --> 03:18:23.974
LAURA: Wow, it's cool-looking! Oh shit, we're
right by the baby.

03:18:23.974 --> 03:18:25.439
LIAM: Where's the baby?

03:18:25.439 --> 03:18:27.534
MATT: There it is.

03:18:27.534 --> 03:18:29.119
LAURA: Oh, that's the baby?

03:18:29.119 --> 03:18:30.684
MATT: It's very tiny.

03:18:30.684 --> 03:18:36.568
LAURA: Oh, it's a mean baby. I feel like it could
be saved, because it's--

03:18:36.568 --> 03:18:40.803
LIAM: When you say saved, do you mean killed?

03:18:40.803 --> 03:18:43.486
LAURA: I feel bad because it's a baby.

03:18:43.486 --> 03:18:50.121
MATT: All right. Initiatives. 25 to 20, anybody?

03:18:50.121 --> 03:18:51.668
LIAM: 25.

03:18:51.668 --> 03:18:53.174
MARISHA: Holy shit.

03:18:53.174 --> 03:18:54.518
MATT: Who rolled what?

03:18:54.518 --> 03:18:55.543
TALIESIN: 30.

03:18:55.543 --> 03:18:56.899
MATT: Jesus Christ, Percy.

03:18:56.899 --> 03:18:58.051
LIAM: So what did you roll?

03:18:58.051 --> 03:19:00.647
TALIESIN: I rolled a 19, and my initiative is 11.

03:19:00.647 --> 03:19:01.877
ASHLEY: Jeez.

03:19:01.877 --> 03:19:03.413
LIAM: Wow.

03:19:03.413 --> 03:19:08.785
TALIESIN: I am going to debate hard how dumb I'm
about to be.

03:19:08.785 --> 03:19:11.426
LIAM: The dumbest.

03:19:11.426 --> 03:19:15.526
MATT: All right. So 20 to 15.

03:19:15.526 --> 03:19:16.727
ASHLEY: 20.

03:19:16.727 --> 03:19:18.506
MARISHA: 19.

03:19:18.506 --> 03:19:20.302
ASHLEY: What did you get?

03:19:20.302 --> 03:19:21.594
LIAM: 25.

03:19:21.594 --> 03:19:23.427
ASHLEY: You got a 25, okay.

03:19:23.427 --> 03:19:24.890
MATT: All right. 15 to 10?

03:19:24.890 --> 03:19:26.084
LAURA: 12.

03:19:26.084 --> 03:19:28.429
MATT: Ten to five.

03:19:28.429 --> 03:19:29.878
SAM: Oh yeah.

03:19:29.878 --> 03:19:30.896
TRAVIS: Eight.

03:19:30.896 --> 03:19:31.946
SAM: Six.

03:19:31.946 --> 03:19:38.549
MATT: All righty. All right, guys, we're going to
keep this coming at everyone fast, because we're

03:19:38.549 --> 03:19:43.890
going to make this happen. All right, first and
foremost, as this creature emerges and you guys

03:19:43.890 --> 03:19:47.231
are in your respective places, Percival, you're up
first.

03:19:47.231 --> 03:19:48.707
TALIESIN: Where am I?

03:19:48.707 --> 03:19:51.494
MATT: You're up here near the top of the platform,
where you saw the recess.

03:19:51.494 --> 03:19:54.681
TALIESIN: Goddamn it! Okay, so I'm far away from
that little bugger, aren't I?

03:19:54.681 --> 03:19:59.180
MATT: Yeah, it appeared on the opposite side of
this double chamber. It's all up from there.

03:19:59.180 --> 03:20:03.988
TALIESIN: Okay. I'm going to hop off the broom.

03:20:03.988 --> 03:20:06.224
MATT: Okay. So you hop off of there.

03:20:06.224 --> 03:20:09.827
TALIESIN: Actually, no. You're going to move
towards it, I assume?

03:20:09.827 --> 03:20:12.772
LAURA: I'm so far below you in the initiative,
though.

03:20:12.772 --> 03:20:14.183
TALIESIN: Okay, that's fair.

03:20:14.183 --> 03:20:20.816
SAM: It's glowing, right, so we can see it even if
we don't turn on flashlights and things?

03:20:20.816 --> 03:20:24.598
MATT: You can see it, yes, but you cannot see the
terrain around you.

03:20:24.598 --> 03:20:26.575
TRAVIS: I'm sure we're going to try and talk to
it, right?

03:20:26.575 --> 03:20:29.909
SAM: Yeah. Maybe it knows my family's name.

03:20:29.909 --> 03:20:32.978
MATT: So Percival, what are you doing?

03:20:32.978 --> 03:20:46.163
TALIESIN: I'm going to hop off the broom, activate
my boots and activate my gloves, and start running

03:20:46.163 --> 03:20:55.600
through that little choke point, and I'm going to
get as close to and possibly on the wall of that

03:20:55.600 --> 03:20:58.591
choke point as humanly possible. The other side of
the choke point.

03:20:58.591 --> 03:21:01.744
MATT: Oh, this side? You can get about there. You
don't quite get to the wall.

03:21:01.744 --> 03:21:03.697
TALIESIN: Okay. I can get about there?

03:21:03.697 --> 03:21:06.431
MATT: You can get further, but currently the
creature is out of your view.

03:21:06.431 --> 03:21:12.677
TALIESIN: That's fine. That's as far as I can get
right now. That will be just fine. The gloves are

03:21:12.677 --> 03:21:15.890
charged, the boots are on, and I'm heading towards
the wall.

03:21:15.890 --> 03:21:17.128
MATT: Okay. That's your turn?

03:21:17.128 --> 03:21:18.229
TALIESIN: Yep.

03:21:18.229 --> 03:21:19.539
MATT: All right. Vax?

03:21:19.539 --> 03:21:25.822
LIAM: Okay. Boots on, I'm going to arc over to ten
feet away from the baby.

03:21:25.822 --> 03:21:28.485
MATT: All right. About there?

03:21:28.485 --> 03:21:33.318
LIAM: Yeah. Where I am, is it straight up, or am I
covered over here?

03:21:33.318 --> 03:21:38.286
MATT: It's straight up. Where you see the walls
are right now, even this is collapsed about here.

03:21:38.286 --> 03:21:45.536
In fact, I'd say, to keep it easier, I'll say
that's a collapsed entrance there. But this is all

03:21:45.536 --> 03:21:49.921
a straight-up hole in the ground. It slowly
funnels as it gets to the bottom.

03:21:49.921 --> 03:21:51.466
LAURA: Whoa.

03:21:51.466 --> 03:22:02.409
LIAM: All right. So action, action, bonus action.
I'm going to cast Vow of Enmity on it.

03:22:02.409 --> 03:22:04.099
MATT: All righty.

03:22:04.099 --> 03:22:06.605
LIAM: Then I'm going to throw Whisper at it.

03:22:06.605 --> 03:22:08.178
MATT: All righty.

03:22:08.178 --> 03:22:12.526
LIAM: That is a 33 to hit.

03:22:12.526 --> 03:22:13.720
MATT: That hits.

03:22:13.720 --> 03:22:16.362
LIAM: I'm going to cast Divine Smite on it.

03:22:16.362 --> 03:22:19.948
LAURA: Good job! Kill that celestial baby!

03:22:19.948 --> 03:22:22.477
LIAM: There's a lot of dice here.

03:22:22.477 --> 03:22:24.503
LAURA: Get all the bacon!

03:22:24.503 --> 03:22:34.125
LIAM: This is ten, plus psychic damage is 11.
That's not very good. 11 plus Divine Smite is 12,

03:22:34.125 --> 03:22:50.273
19, plus sneak attack damage. 19, 21, 26, 28, 29,
34, 36, 38. And there's nothing extra because it's

03:22:50.273 --> 03:22:52.332
celestial, not a fiend.

03:22:52.332 --> 03:22:53.483
MATT: Correct.

03:22:53.483 --> 03:22:58.456
LIAM: All right. So that was bonus action, action,
I'm going to use my action to then just fly away

03:22:58.456 --> 03:23:04.419
from the fucking thing, a hundred feet away
diagonally up into the tunnel where I can still

03:23:04.419 --> 03:23:06.531
see it, hopefully. I'm hasted.

03:23:06.531 --> 03:23:08.044
MATT: Right.

03:23:08.044 --> 03:23:15.661
LIAM: Movement was to get there. Bonus action for
Vow of Enmity. Action to attack, and then my

03:23:15.661 --> 03:23:18.551
hasted action I can use for dash, hide,
disengage.

03:23:18.551 --> 03:23:20.590
MATT: Correct. Dash is your full movement, which
is--

03:23:20.590 --> 03:23:28.442
LIAM: 60 normally, 120 feet hasted. I didn't make
these rules or these items. (whoosh)

03:23:28.442 --> 03:23:30.664
MATT: Cool.

03:23:30.664 --> 03:23:40.658
LIAM: Diagonally up. I'll fly by my sister, how's
that?

03:23:40.658 --> 03:23:47.549
MATT: You fly by your sister? Okay. No worries.
That ends your turn. All right. Pike, you're up.

03:23:47.549 --> 03:23:50.704
ASHLEY: Okay. I'm going to cast Beacon of Hope.

03:23:50.871 --> 03:23:55.560
MATT: Actually, sorry. Before the end of your
turn, it's going to go ahead and use a legendary

03:23:55.560 --> 03:23:58.086
action to use a terrain shift.

03:23:58.086 --> 03:24:01.698
TRAVIS: But it's just a baby!

03:24:01.698 --> 03:24:05.213
LAURA: Oh no! We're in its lair!

03:24:05.213 --> 03:24:12.050
MATT: Yep. As you stab the creature, it (gasps).
There's a horrible sucking sound as you dart back.

03:24:12.050 --> 03:24:17.122
It looks over in your direction. The wings flutter
once and it brings its arms up, and as it does and

03:24:17.122 --> 03:24:21.875
you land next to your sister, you feel the air
around you begin to freeze in cold. This energy's

03:24:21.875 --> 03:24:27.283
just (crackling). You feel ice crystals condense
around, and both of you feel the air in your lungs

03:24:27.283 --> 03:24:30.366
suddenly begin to freeze up. I need both of you
guys to make constitution saving throws.

03:24:30.366 --> 03:24:37.471
LAURA: Thanks for coming right next to me on that
one. Goddamn it.

03:24:37.471 --> 03:24:38.642
LIAM: Natural 20.

03:24:38.642 --> 03:24:39.840
MATT: Nice!

03:24:39.840 --> 03:24:41.227
LAURA: What am I doing, a constitution?

03:24:41.227 --> 03:24:42.911
MATT: Constitution saving throw.

03:24:42.911 --> 03:24:44.131
LAURA: Nine.

03:24:44.131 --> 03:24:55.708
MATT: All righty. 19 points of cold damage to you,
Vex, and that is nine points of cold damage to

03:24:55.708 --> 03:25:05.037
you, Vax. And while you manage to pull out of this
space of condensed cold, Vax, your sister,

03:25:05.037 --> 03:25:11.722
however, becomes stunned for one round as your
body is frozen and locked in place.

03:25:11.722 --> 03:25:14.964
SAM: Do we see any of this happen?

03:25:14.964 --> 03:25:19.146
MATT: You watch the air coalesce into this frozen
area, and while the broom is still holding you

03:25:19.146 --> 03:25:25.385
aloft, thankfully, you are standing there in place
and the ice falls, clatters, and slams into the

03:25:25.385 --> 03:25:29.543
ground below you, sounding like the shattering of
a hundred pieces of crystal across the stonework.

03:25:29.543 --> 03:25:31.472
Pike, now it's your turn.

03:25:31.472 --> 03:25:40.749
ASHLEY: Okay. I'm going to cast Beacon of Hope.
And for my bonus action, I'm going to pull out a

03:25:40.749 --> 03:25:44.962
spiritual weapon of a giant big greatsword.

03:25:44.962 --> 03:25:47.077
TRAVIS: Yeah!

03:25:47.077 --> 03:25:51.714
LAURA: A giant baby rattle that's directly in
front of it.

03:25:51.714 --> 03:25:54.050
TRAVIS: Don't fight, play with this.

03:25:54.050 --> 03:25:58.703
MATT: It's a level two spiritual weapon. Where are
you putting the spiritual weapon?

03:25:58.703 --> 03:26:00.692
ASHLEY: Right in front of the baby!

03:26:00.692 --> 03:26:03.654
MATT: All right. I believe you get to make an
attack with it, then, if you do.

03:26:03.654 --> 03:26:04.345
ASHLEY: Yeah.

03:26:04.414 --> 03:26:06.286
MATT: All right. So.

03:26:06.286 --> 03:26:10.808
ASHLEY: Oh, but I don't know if I want to hurt the
baby. Did you do any damage?

03:26:10.808 --> 03:26:12.037
LIAM: Yeah.

03:26:12.037 --> 03:26:15.671
MATT: Once again, roll for attack on that.

03:26:15.671 --> 03:26:18.892
ASHLEY: Oh, that's not very good.

03:26:18.892 --> 03:26:23.853
MATT: So you roll a d20 and add your spell attack
modifier.

03:26:23.853 --> 03:26:25.371
ASHLEY: 13.

03:26:25.371 --> 03:26:30.515
MATT: 13. (whoosh) It swings, and the creature
flaps out of the way and avoids the blow.

03:26:30.515 --> 03:26:32.596
ASHLEY: Stupid piece of dice crap.

03:26:32.596 --> 03:26:34.030
MATT: Are you going to move or stay where you
are?

03:26:34.030 --> 03:26:39.079
LAURA: Oh yeah! I'm resistant to cold, Travis just
reminded me! I have cold resistance because of my

03:26:39.079 --> 03:26:40.189
Vorugal armor.

03:26:40.189 --> 03:26:41.364
MATT: You do.

03:26:41.364 --> 03:26:42.874
LAURA: Does that mean I roll again for--

03:26:42.874 --> 03:26:45.111
MATT: No, you take half the damage, but you're
still stunned.

03:26:45.111 --> 03:26:49.437
LAURA: Oh, okay. So that was 17?

03:26:49.437 --> 03:26:52.200
MATT: You would take nine damage instead of the
19.

03:26:52.200 --> 03:26:54.241
LIAM: Nine instead of 18 is what you would've
taken for it.

03:26:54.241 --> 03:26:55.686
LAURA: Okay, so add nine back.

03:26:55.686 --> 03:26:58.395
MATT: So do you want to move with your turn?

03:26:58.395 --> 03:26:59.966
ASHLEY: No, I'm going to stay.

03:26:59.966 --> 03:27:01.041
MATT: Okay.

03:27:01.041 --> 03:27:05.792
ASHLEY: I'm going to stay. Because we're on the
carpet, right? Grog, Percy, and I on the carpet?

03:27:05.792 --> 03:27:07.047
TALIESIN: I'm not on the carpet.

03:27:07.047 --> 03:27:09.855
ASHLEY: You're not on the carpet anymore? Oh, the
three of us. I'm going to stay on the carpet.

03:27:09.855 --> 03:27:11.848
TALIESIN: You can move the carpet forward,
though.

03:27:11.848 --> 03:27:13.514
LAURA: Did Beacon of Hope get everybody?

03:27:13.514 --> 03:27:28.351
MATT: Beacon of Hope. The range on that is 30
feet. 30-foot range gets everybody

03:27:28.351 --> 03:27:30.572
except for the elemental.

03:27:30.572 --> 03:27:31.998
MARISHA: That's cool.

03:27:31.998 --> 03:27:33.729
TALIESIN: What do we get?

03:27:33.729 --> 03:27:38.121
MATT: Beacon of Hope, you have advantage on Wisdom
saving throws, death saving throws, and you regain

03:27:38.170 --> 03:27:41.046
the max number of hit points possible from any
healing.

03:27:41.046 --> 03:27:42.522
MARISHA: Sick.

03:27:42.522 --> 03:27:45.064
MATT: All righty. That end your turn?

03:27:45.064 --> 03:27:46.432
ASHLEY: Yes.

03:27:46.432 --> 03:27:51.334
LAURA: Death saving throw is huge. And healing is
huge.

03:27:51.334 --> 03:27:59.525
MATT: At the end of your turn, the creature goes
(raspy breathing) and you watch as the ground

03:27:59.525 --> 03:28:09.848
right beneath the carpet explodes. It peels back
as molten lava suddenly begins to spill up in a

03:28:09.848 --> 03:28:13.825
column beneath you, splattering up and to the back
and over the top of the carpet. I need everybody

03:28:13.825 --> 03:28:19.768
in this cluster, this ten-foot-by-ten-foot
section, to make a dexterity saving throw.

03:28:19.768 --> 03:28:32.773
SAM: Not good, but maybe I'm lucky. Oh, am I not
in that? Where am I?

03:28:32.773 --> 03:28:34.801
TALIESIN: You're over on the corner.

03:28:34.801 --> 03:28:36.627
SAM: I have no idea where I am.

03:28:36.627 --> 03:28:40.082
LAURA: You're next to the big white thing.

03:28:40.082 --> 03:28:41.319
SAM: I am?

03:28:41.319 --> 03:28:43.286
MATT: So Grog, Pike, and Keyleth.

03:28:43.286 --> 03:28:44.720
SAM: Oh, well then, never mind.

03:28:44.720 --> 03:28:46.294
TRAVIS: Danger sense 18.

03:28:46.294 --> 03:28:48.051
MATT: Danger sense 18.

03:28:48.051 --> 03:28:49.176
MARISHA: 17.

03:28:49.176 --> 03:28:50.387
ASHLEY: Natural 20.

03:28:50.387 --> 03:28:52.173
MATT: Natural 20 plus, what's your--

03:28:52.173 --> 03:28:54.557
ASHLEY: One! 21!

03:28:54.557 --> 03:28:56.958
MATT: Pike's the only one who made it.

03:28:56.958 --> 03:28:59.249
ASHLEY: What?

03:28:59.249 --> 03:29:06.258
MATT: Pike, you suffer 21 points of fire damage,
halved because of your armor, so you only take

03:29:06.258 --> 03:29:09.717
ten. Ten points of fire damage.

03:29:09.717 --> 03:29:10.815
ASHLEY: Okay.

03:29:10.815 --> 03:29:13.523
MATT: I need you to go ahead and make a
concentration check on Beacon of Hope.

03:29:13.523 --> 03:29:17.318
LAURA: You got this. You got this, Pike.

03:29:17.318 --> 03:29:19.292
MATT: Just roll a constitution saving throw.

03:29:19.292 --> 03:29:20.798
TRAVIS: Fucking molten lava!

03:29:20.798 --> 03:29:24.678
MATT: Keyleth and Grog, you guys both take 42
points of fire damage.

03:29:24.678 --> 03:29:29.195
TRAVIS: Oh, it was nice being over 250 for a
little while.

03:29:29.195 --> 03:29:30.817
ASHLEY: Fucking fuck.

03:29:30.817 --> 03:29:50.048
MATT: The ground below you right now is currently
in flames, and you guys have to stick around that

03:29:50.048 --> 03:29:57.787
space there. The open ground is billowing flame
and lava now, and the area around that platform is

03:29:57.787 --> 03:30:01.212
searing hot. So what did you roll?

03:30:01.212 --> 03:30:02.386
ASHLEY: Five.

03:30:02.386 --> 03:30:03.864
MATT: A five with your--

03:30:03.864 --> 03:30:05.736
ASHLEY: Yes.

03:30:05.736 --> 03:30:09.437
MATT: Yeah. You lose Beacon of Hope. Sorry.

03:30:09.437 --> 03:30:16.470
LAURA: What is it? You have to get above half of
the damage you took, is that what it is?

03:30:16.499 --> 03:30:19.556
MATT: You have to get above half the damage you
took or ten, whichever is higher.

03:30:19.556 --> 03:30:20.888
LAURA: Oh.

03:30:20.888 --> 03:30:23.361
TRAVIS: Do we stay on the carpet or are we knocked
off?

03:30:23.361 --> 03:30:29.532
MATT: You guys can choose to stay on the carpet.
You pull out of the way, and now the area is just

03:30:29.532 --> 03:30:32.874
billowing with lava and flame. Keyleth, it's your
turn.

03:30:32.874 --> 03:30:37.455
MARISHA: Okay. I'm going to take and control my
air elemental and send him over.

03:30:37.455 --> 03:30:40.895
MATT: All right. You took how much damage? 42?

03:30:40.895 --> 03:30:42.061
MARISHA: 42.

03:30:42.061 --> 03:30:45.270
MATT: Make a concentration check. Constitution
saving throw.

03:30:45.270 --> 03:30:48.565
MARISHA: So I have to get over-- I have advantage
on these.

03:30:48.565 --> 03:30:51.635
MATT: Yes. You have to get over a 21.

03:30:51.635 --> 03:30:53.632
SAM: Over a 21!

03:30:53.632 --> 03:30:57.003
MATT: A 21 or over.

03:30:57.003 --> 03:31:00.192
MARISHA: What's 17 plus four?

03:31:00.192 --> 03:31:01.361
SAM: 21.

03:31:01.361 --> 03:31:03.519
MATT: 21. You just maintain concentration.

03:31:03.519 --> 03:31:06.844
LAURA: Good roll!

03:31:06.844 --> 03:31:18.005
MARISHA: Thank you, Gil! All right. So (boom) I
send him over with my staff.

03:31:18.005 --> 03:31:22.624
It has 90-feet fly speed.

03:31:22.624 --> 03:31:27.513
MATT: 90-feet flying speed? Yeah, he gets over
there easy. Plops on over.

03:31:27.513 --> 03:31:36.179
MARISHA: And he's going to go ahead and do a
Whirlwind. The creatures in his space have to make

03:31:36.179 --> 03:31:39.238
a DC 13 strength saving throw.

03:31:39.238 --> 03:31:46.643
MATT: Okay. Nope. This is not a very strong
creature.

03:31:46.643 --> 03:31:51.588
MARISHA: That's what I hoped. They take 3d8 plus
two bludgeoning damage.

03:31:51.588 --> 03:31:54.189
MATT: Go ahead and roll the damage on that, yeah.

03:31:54.189 --> 03:32:08.290
MARISHA: Oh, that's nasty. 12 plus seven is 19
plus two, so 21. And they are flung up to 20 feet

03:32:08.290 --> 03:32:11.656
away from the elemental in a random direction and
knocked prone.

03:32:11.656 --> 03:32:16.582
MATT: Random direction, I'll roll for that. Okay.
That's going to fling him 20 feet into the five,

03:32:16.582 --> 03:32:20.654
ten, 15, 20 into the wall right there, and prone.

03:32:20.654 --> 03:32:22.566
MARISHA: And are knocked prone.

03:32:22.566 --> 03:32:24.143
LIAM: Stupid baby.

03:32:24.143 --> 03:32:27.171
MARISHA: Do I still have line of sight?

03:32:27.171 --> 03:32:30.860
MATT: To it right now, no. You would have to get
off the carpet to go.

03:32:30.860 --> 03:32:38.843
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm going to get off the carpet and
walk over just to where I have line of sight.

03:32:38.843 --> 03:32:50.348
MATT: Okay. At the top of your turn, by the way,
you suffer eight points of fire damage by the

03:32:50.348 --> 03:32:52.102
proximity to the flaming platform there.

03:32:52.102 --> 03:32:57.535
MARISHA: Even though my mantle allows me to ignore
the penalties of dangerous weather effects?

03:32:57.535 --> 03:33:02.593
MATT: It's not so much a weather effect. It's more
that there's a heaping column of molten rock.

03:33:02.593 --> 03:33:05.059
TRAVIS: Your old friend, molten lava.

03:33:05.059 --> 03:33:14.258
MATT: Eight points of fire damage. And I need you
to make another concentration check.

03:33:14.258 --> 03:33:16.695
SAM: Oh no, another concentration check!

03:33:16.695 --> 03:33:19.853
MARISHA: I'm a warcaster, though, man! Because
that's eight, so I just have

03:33:19.853 --> 03:33:21.215
to get over a ten, right?

03:33:21.215 --> 03:33:22.447
MATT: Yeah.

03:33:22.447 --> 03:33:26.397
LAURA: What is this considered, Underdark, or a
dungeon?

03:33:26.397 --> 03:33:28.732
MARISHA: Rolled a 13.

03:33:28.732 --> 03:33:35.854
MATT: This is considered subterranean, not
Underdark. Cavern. All right, so you've done that.

03:33:35.854 --> 03:33:38.269
What do you want to do, Keyleth? You're over
here.

03:33:38.269 --> 03:33:40.498
MARISHA: Okay. Can I move over to where I have
line of sight?

03:33:40.498 --> 03:33:43.083
MATT: Yeah, so you leap over and you get line of
sight on him right there.

03:33:43.083 --> 03:33:44.944
MARISHA: Okay, can I do Blight?

03:33:44.944 --> 03:33:48.746
MATT: Sure. What's the DC on that?

03:33:48.746 --> 03:33:53.595
MARISHA: I think my spell level, so 20.

03:33:53.595 --> 03:33:55.578
MATT: And it's a constitution saving throw, I
believe?

03:33:55.578 --> 03:33:57.097
MARISHA: 8d8.

03:33:57.097 --> 03:34:00.800
MATT: Six plus ten, so it's a 16.

03:34:00.800 --> 03:34:03.086
MARISHA: No, fail.

03:34:03.086 --> 03:34:05.829
MATT: Yeah. So roll your 8d8 necrotic damage.

03:34:05.829 --> 03:34:07.639
LAURA: Get it!

03:34:07.639 --> 03:34:12.399
MATT: Yeah, no. Even with advantage on the save,
it rolled a six and a four.

03:34:12.399 --> 03:34:21.891
MARISHA: One, two, three, four. Give me two more.
One more, and another.

03:34:21.891 --> 03:34:24.192
TALIESIN: I don't know if I have another.

03:34:24.192 --> 03:34:27.177
MARISHA: Give me a d8. Okay.

03:34:27.177 --> 03:34:33.009
TALIESIN: And you reroll ones, right?

03:34:33.009 --> 03:34:53.279
MARISHA: No, on elementals. Four, five, nine, 14,
plus eight is 22, plus four is 26, plus two is 28.

03:34:53.279 --> 03:34:56.366
28 Blight damage.

03:34:56.366 --> 03:35:01.282
MATT: Nice. As you reach, it's on the ground. It's
trying to get back up, and its wings are flapping,

03:35:01.282 --> 03:35:06.289
and all of a sudden you watch as its gray,
withered skin turns dark black on one half of its

03:35:06.289 --> 03:35:12.324
body and it (screech) shrieks out and gives
another scream (hoarse scream) from the ground,

03:35:12.324 --> 03:35:21.883
and the area quakes again, and you feel the ground
shimmy a bit. The ground beneath you, as its last

03:35:21.883 --> 03:35:27.289
legendary action, begins to give way. Keyleth, I
need you to make a dexterity saving throw.

03:35:27.289 --> 03:35:31.550
MARISHA: Fucking lava!

03:35:31.550 --> 03:35:35.516
TALIESIN: Didn't you move? Wait, no, you moved,
didn't you?

03:35:35.516 --> 03:35:37.240
MATT: Yeah, this is a different area.

03:35:37.240 --> 03:35:42.984
MARISHA: That's not bad. 19. No, 18?

03:35:42.984 --> 03:35:48.204
MATT: Nope. So as you finish casting this and you
hear it scream, you cover your ears, and suddenly

03:35:48.204 --> 03:35:52.251
the ground moves out beneath you. You watch as the
actual floor (whoosh).

03:35:52.251 --> 03:35:54.983
MARISHA: I turn to everyone behind me and I go,
aw, fuck!

03:35:54.983 --> 03:36:02.242
MATT: As you watch Keyleth plummet into a pit
below. You take eight points of bludgeoning damage

03:36:02.242 --> 03:36:05.873
and the ground (whoosh) covers over her.

03:36:05.873 --> 03:36:08.803
MARISHA: It's fine.

03:36:08.803 --> 03:36:15.084
MATT: Keyleth vanishes. The ground seems to
swallow her up. Keyleth, the entire pit collapses

03:36:15.084 --> 03:36:18.761
in on you, and you're currently restrained
underground, and you cannot breathe.

03:36:18.761 --> 03:36:20.043
MARISHA: All right.

03:36:20.043 --> 03:36:22.385
TALIESIN: That's fixable.

03:36:22.385 --> 03:36:25.057
SAM: But can you cast things while you can't
move?

03:36:25.057 --> 03:36:27.589
MATT: I need you to make another concentration
check.

03:36:27.589 --> 03:36:29.200
MARISHA: On my elemental?

03:36:29.200 --> 03:36:30.602
MATT: Yes.

03:36:30.602 --> 03:36:37.119
MARISHA: Yeah, 13 plus my constitution, right?

03:36:37.119 --> 03:36:38.248
MATT: Yeah.

03:36:38.248 --> 03:36:39.740
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm good.

03:36:39.740 --> 03:36:42.070
MATT: Okay. That ends your turn, Keyleth?

03:36:42.070 --> 03:36:44.571
TRAVIS: Matt, can you point to where the cherub
is?

03:36:44.571 --> 03:36:54.786
MATT: I am, because it's his turn. The cherub
creature, this Symphior, begins to fly up off the

03:36:54.786 --> 03:37:01.284
ground and make its way back in this direction,
out into the open once more.

03:37:01.284 --> 03:37:05.329
LIAM: Keeps everyone from getting a good night's
sleep.

03:37:05.329 --> 03:37:07.713
LAURA: He needs a nap.

03:37:07.713 --> 03:37:13.034
ASHLEY: He has a dirty diaper. He's mad.

03:37:13.034 --> 03:37:16.080
LIAM: It's been a thousand years!

03:37:16.080 --> 03:37:28.043
MATT: As it floats upward, it looks over towards
where-- let's see, because all it sees is you two.

03:37:28.043 --> 03:37:34.053
You both are still in the flames right there. It's
not worried about the fire at the moment. It sees

03:37:34.053 --> 03:37:41.243
you, Taryon, and goes (hoarse wheezing) and lifts
its hands up. I need you to go ahead and make a

03:37:41.243 --> 03:37:43.744
dexterity saving throw.

03:37:43.744 --> 03:37:50.591
SAM: I'm feeling lucky. Natural 20! Plus one.

03:37:50.591 --> 03:38:02.981
MATT: That's great. So you only suffer 11 points
of piercing damage.

03:38:02.981 --> 03:38:04.741
SAM: Hey, that's not bad.

03:38:04.741 --> 03:38:08.394
MATT: As you leap out of the way, you watch as the
ground suddenly turns into a series of earthlike

03:38:08.394 --> 03:38:14.000
spikes underneath, and some pierce you and scratch
you and you roll out of the way. You barely move

03:38:14.000 --> 03:38:21.244
off to the side, where now you see this giant,
jutting series of spike-like pillars forcing up

03:38:21.244 --> 03:38:27.395
from the ground. All right, that's going to end
that attack, and it's going to use the rest of its

03:38:27.395 --> 03:38:36.647
movement to move back (whoosh) over to there in
the corner. That brings us back to Vex.

03:38:36.647 --> 03:38:38.138
It's your turn now.

03:38:38.138 --> 03:38:39.758
LAURA: Yeah, I'm frozen.

03:38:39.758 --> 03:38:42.087
MATT: Yeah, so you're stunned, and that's your
turn.

03:38:42.087 --> 03:38:43.285
LAURA: Yay.

03:38:43.285 --> 03:38:48.189
MATT: You eventually break the ice off at the end
of your turn, and you're breathing heavily and

03:38:48.189 --> 03:38:52.966
trying to get the feeling back in your skin.
That's your go. Grog, you're up.

03:38:52.966 --> 03:38:55.278
TRAVIS: What does it take to activate the coin?

03:38:55.278 --> 03:38:57.081
SAM: You have to slap it on yourself.

03:38:57.081 --> 03:38:58.521
MATT: It's an action.

03:38:58.521 --> 03:39:01.066
TRAVIS: Yeah? Just an action?

03:39:01.066 --> 03:39:02.447
MATT: Which spell do you have?

03:39:02.447 --> 03:39:03.947
TRAVIS: It's the Jump coin, three times my--

03:39:03.947 --> 03:39:05.345
MATT: What's the casting time of Jump?

03:39:05.345 --> 03:39:06.358
SAM: It's touch.

03:39:06.358 --> 03:39:08.179
MATT: What's the casting &lt;i&gt;time&lt;/i&gt; of Jump?

03:39:08.179 --> 03:39:12.098
SAM: It lasts a minute. It's instantaneous. You
just touch, right?

03:39:12.098 --> 03:39:13.725
TALIESIN: No, is it a bonus action?

03:39:13.725 --> 03:39:16.714
MATT: So that would be your action to use it on
yourself.

03:39:16.714 --> 03:39:26.801
TRAVIS: Oh, damn. It's that whole shit, yo. All
right. (grunts) I'm going to jump! And I would

03:39:26.801 --> 03:39:37.723
like to rage as my bonus action. And with my new
Jump coin, I would like to jump with my Boots of

03:39:37.723 --> 03:39:44.886
Feral Leaping. It's three times my horizontal jump
speed, which is 20 feet, so 60 feet.

03:39:44.886 --> 03:39:47.463
MATT: Okay. You also take seven points of fire
damage at the start of your turn, because you're

03:39:47.463 --> 03:39:48.476
by this flame.

03:39:48.476 --> 03:39:55.384
TRAVIS: Oh, got it. Nice, that's fine. And can I
jump towards the baby? Actually just to the right

03:39:55.384 --> 03:40:01.011
of the-- just over here.

03:40:01.011 --> 03:40:02.559
MATT: Over to this side there?

03:40:02.559 --> 03:40:03.723
TRAVIS: Yeah, right there.

03:40:03.723 --> 03:40:07.800
MATT: Okay, yeah. You run (whoosh, thud) land next
to it.

03:40:07.800 --> 03:40:11.942
TRAVIS: Nice. Do I have any movement left?

03:40:11.942 --> 03:40:16.094
MATT: With the run and the jump, you have maybe
ten feet.

03:40:16.094 --> 03:40:17.695
TRAVIS: Okay. I want to get right up on him.

03:40:17.695 --> 03:40:20.600
MATT: Yeah, you're right up on him.

03:40:20.600 --> 03:40:27.859
TRAVIS: Never mind. I'm good. Rage, jump, no more
action. Titanstone Knuckles? Next round. Okay.

03:40:27.859 --> 03:40:29.396
MATT: You have an action, still.

03:40:29.396 --> 03:40:30.434
TRAVIS: Oh, I do?

03:40:30.434 --> 03:40:35.394
MATT: Well, no, because you said it's a bonus
action to do the leap? What's it say on that? Just

03:40:35.456 --> 03:40:40.291
to do the leap, right? It was the run. You still
have an action.

03:40:40.291 --> 03:40:41.623
TRAVIS: I want to hit him.

03:40:41.623 --> 03:40:43.013
MATT: Go for it.

03:40:43.013 --> 03:40:45.562
TRAVIS: Great weapon master, reckless attack.

03:40:45.562 --> 03:40:46.858
MATT: Okay!

03:40:46.858 --> 03:40:56.084
TRAVIS: That's a 26.

03:40:56.084 --> 03:40:58.386
MATT: 26 with the minus five? Yeah, that hits.

03:40:58.386 --> 03:41:12.239
TRAVIS: Nice. 12. Where are you? I should have
gotten this beforehand. Nice! Plus ten. 37.

03:41:12.239 --> 03:41:17.098
MATT: All righty. That's your first strike.

03:41:17.098 --> 03:41:19.244
TRAVIS: Oh, I get another one!

03:41:19.244 --> 03:41:21.262
MATT: You have extra attack, man!

03:41:21.262 --> 03:41:27.901
TRAVIS: 11, 24.

03:41:27.901 --> 03:41:36.483
MATT: 24 does not hit. It's a tiny size. It's hard
to swing at, and as your axe almost catches it, it

03:41:36.483 --> 03:41:38.056
(whoosh) out of the way.

03:41:38.056 --> 03:41:42.148
TRAVIS: Okay. Good to know. I whiff. That's it. I
just have the two.

03:41:42.148 --> 03:41:50.313
MATT: Yep, that's your turn. At the end of your
turn, because it's reset back to its ground, it's

03:41:50.313 --> 03:41:55.547
going to go ahead and look to you in front of it
and go (hoarse breathing).

03:41:55.547 --> 03:41:56.947
Make a dexterity check.

03:41:56.947 --> 03:41:59.345
TRAVIS: Okay. Saving throw or just dexterity?

03:41:59.345 --> 03:42:00.784
MATT: Dexterity saving throw, sorry.

03:42:00.784 --> 03:42:05.743
TRAVIS: I get two of those. That's better. 19.

03:42:05.743 --> 03:42:12.485
MATT: The ground crumbles beneath you and you
suddenly (whoosh) fall below. You are raging. It

03:42:12.485 --> 03:42:18.028
would've been 12 points of bludgeoning damage, but
it becomes six. But you are suddenly buried and

03:42:18.028 --> 03:42:20.848
restrained underground.

03:42:20.848 --> 03:42:23.760
LIAM: Got that slick stuff on you? Crisco oil?

03:42:23.760 --> 03:42:25.941
TRAVIS: But that's my next turn. That happens on
my turn.

03:42:25.941 --> 03:42:28.694
TALIESIN: Yeah, you burn five feet of movement to
get out of it.

03:42:28.694 --> 03:42:30.713
TRAVIS: Can I get out of it if I'm buried in soil,
though?

03:42:30.713 --> 03:42:34.712
MATT: Freedom of Movement. I'll say it doesn't
have--

03:42:34.712 --> 03:42:38.291
MARISHA: That's why I cast it on him, man.

03:42:38.291 --> 03:42:40.670
TALIESIN: You parkour around the rocks as they try
and--

03:42:40.670 --> 03:42:48.587
MATT: Well, he's buried in the ground, regardless.
That's the effect. He didn't avoid the burying. So

03:42:48.587 --> 03:42:53.402
I guess you'd just, if you want to use your action
to try to escape, you do so.

03:42:53.402 --> 03:42:56.829
LAURA: You could enlarge, maybe. You can enlarge
and come up out of it.

03:42:56.829 --> 03:43:04.296
MATT: All right. That ends that go. Taryon, you're
up.

03:43:04.296 --> 03:43:12.414
SAM: Me? Oh god. All right. I don't have anything
I can do. I will click my Boots of Speed, making

03:43:12.414 --> 03:43:22.348
me faster, and then I will move. Full movement of
60 feet towards him-- or her.

03:43:22.348 --> 03:43:24.952
We don't know, do we?

03:43:24.952 --> 03:43:28.787
LAURA: Is it wearing a diaper, or is its dangly
bits hanging out?

03:43:28.787 --> 03:43:30.580
LIAM: Is a peeper hanging out?

03:43:30.580 --> 03:43:32.044
SAM: Is it naked?

03:43:32.044 --> 03:43:37.573
MATT: You've got a pretty close look, if you
wanted to take a moment to inspect.

03:43:37.573 --> 03:43:43.441
LIAM: It's a boy!

03:43:43.488 --> 03:43:46.179
SAM: We're trying to kill this thing, yeah?

03:43:46.261 --> 03:43:48.323
TRAVIS: Yeah!

03:43:48.323 --> 03:43:56.568
SAM: I guess I'll punch a baby. It's going to
miss, though. That's a slippery baby, right?

03:43:56.568 --> 03:44:05.292
MATT: At 60 feet of movement, you're not quite
within melee range of it.

03:44:05.292 --> 03:44:07.766
SAM: No, I was going to use my Ring of the Ram.

03:44:07.766 --> 03:44:09.166
MATT: Oh, that'll do.

03:44:09.166 --> 03:44:13.011
SAM: But I'm probably not going to hit, because
it's got an amazing AC.

03:44:13.011 --> 03:44:14.390
LIAM: Got any Luck left?

03:44:14.393 --> 03:44:15.891
SAM: Yeah, I do.

03:44:15.891 --> 03:44:17.610
TALIESIN: See what happens.

03:44:17.610 --> 03:44:19.364
LIAM: Got to do something.

03:44:19.364 --> 03:44:28.796
SAM: Is this going to be a long fight? I'll do all
three charges of the Ring of the Ram,

03:44:28.796 --> 03:44:30.475
and punch a baby.

03:44:30.475 --> 03:44:32.756
MATT: Okay, go ahead and roll for an attack.

03:44:32.756 --> 03:44:42.583
SAM: Eight. Not good enough, I'll use Luck. 13
plus nine? 22.

03:44:42.583 --> 03:44:49.785
ASHLEY: Wait! Can I War God's Blessing?

03:44:49.785 --> 03:44:51.464
MATT: What's the range on War God's Blessing?

03:44:51.464 --> 03:44:53.650
ASHLEY: Let's see. 30 feet?

03:44:53.650 --> 03:44:57.259
MATT: No, he's out of range for that,
unfortunately. Sorry!

03:44:57.259 --> 03:44:58.852
LIAM: I wanted that baby to be punched so bad.

03:44:58.852 --> 03:45:05.383
MATT: As you (ring firing), it (whoosh) out of the
way and the fist goes by. Slamming into the wall.

03:45:05.383 --> 03:45:07.438
(crash)

03:45:07.438 --> 03:45:09.163
TALIESIN: One day, it's going to be epic.

03:45:09.163 --> 03:45:12.908
SAM: It worked once.

03:45:12.908 --> 03:45:15.444
MATT: It got you a kill. The marid.

03:45:15.444 --> 03:45:17.415
LIAM: That little baby just Zatoichi-ed out of the
way.

03:45:17.415 --> 03:45:20.079
MATT: Yeah, so you're just like, (ring firing). No
effect. It dodges out of the way. And now you can

03:45:20.079 --> 03:45:25.094
see its weird, lifeless white eyes turn towards
you once more.

03:45:25.094 --> 03:45:26.633
SAM: Oh, great.

03:45:26.633 --> 03:45:28.194
MATT: That end your turn?

03:45:28.194 --> 03:45:29.214
SAM: Yep.

03:45:29.214 --> 03:45:45.500
MATT: All righty. Let's see here. It's going to go
ahead and use another ability now. As it sees that

03:45:45.500 --> 03:45:51.029
you're closed in, it glances over, and you watch
as suddenly, a bunch of stonework just

03:45:51.073 --> 03:45:57.503
(rushing noise) up in the center of the area, as now--

03:45:57.503 --> 03:46:01.977
MARISHA: Oh, fuck. One of these guys. What? A
wall?

03:46:01.977 --> 03:46:07.407
MATT: A giant stone wall suddenly shoots up above
to about 40 feet.

03:46:07.407 --> 03:46:13.773
SAM: We got this, guys. Don't worry. Me and Grog
got it. Me and buried-Grog and buried-Keyleth,

03:46:13.773 --> 03:46:14.846
we got this.

03:46:14.846 --> 03:46:16.671
MARISHA: Wait, you're buried, too?

03:46:16.671 --> 03:46:18.500
SAM: No, you are and Grog is.

03:46:18.500 --> 03:46:21.605
MARISHA: I'm under the wall, right?

03:46:21.605 --> 03:46:26.778
MATT: You're underneath right over here. You're on
the outskirts of the wall.

03:46:26.778 --> 03:46:28.334
SAM: It's just me and the baby right now?

03:46:28.334 --> 03:46:32.342
MATT: Yeah, you and the baby, and an air
elemental, and a giant sword that's swinging.

03:46:32.342 --> 03:46:33.787
MARISHA: Yeah, my air elemental is there.

03:46:33.787 --> 03:46:35.578
SAM: Oh, great. I'm fine, then.

03:46:35.578 --> 03:46:41.274
MATT: But you lose vision entirely, Pike. Just
(rushing noise) wall's in front of you. Percy,

03:46:41.274 --> 03:46:42.128
you're up.

03:46:42.128 --> 03:46:44.025
TALIESIN: So is the wall hitting the roof?

03:46:44.025 --> 03:46:47.164
MATT: No, the wall would have to go way high. It's
about 40 feet up.

03:46:47.164 --> 03:46:49.811
TALIESIN: I'm going to run up to the top of that
wall.

03:46:49.811 --> 03:46:53.566
MATT: Your movement will not get you to the top.
Because you only move 30 feet.

03:46:53.566 --> 03:46:55.748
TALIESIN: How far will my movement get me?

03:46:55.748 --> 03:46:57.237
MATT: It'll get you about there.

03:46:57.237 --> 03:47:01.101
ASHLEY: Parkour!

03:47:01.101 --> 03:47:04.207
TRAVIS: Like some unmotivated Spider-Man.

03:47:04.207 --> 03:47:09.003
TALIESIN: In that case-- oh fuck, I've got nothing
I can do.

03:47:09.003 --> 03:47:12.565
MATT: I'll put you right there to remind us, but
you're almost at the top of the wall

03:47:12.565 --> 03:47:13.687
at your full movement.

03:47:13.687 --> 03:47:16.837
TALIESIN: Well, then I will burn my action to dash
up.

03:47:16.837 --> 03:47:19.805
MATT: Okay. You get to the top of the wall, there,
and you can now see it.

03:47:19.805 --> 03:47:24.770
TALIESIN: And I assume I can get part of the way
down the wall as well with my action?

03:47:24.770 --> 03:47:26.605
MATT: You can get partway down the wall, yeah.

03:47:26.605 --> 03:47:29.475
TALIESIN: Yeah, so I just want to start making my
way, I'm going Spider-man.

03:47:29.475 --> 03:47:34.412
MATT: So you get about, I'll say, there on the
opposite side.

03:47:34.412 --> 03:47:36.683
TALIESIN: That was definitely irritating.

03:47:36.683 --> 03:47:38.156
MATT: That's your turn, Percy?

03:47:38.156 --> 03:47:45.462
TALIESIN: That, and I'm going to cast Hex on that
little baby. And he has disadvantage on, let's

03:47:45.462 --> 03:47:51.590
make it his wisdom checks.

03:47:51.590 --> 03:48:07.506
MATT: Okay. All right. At the end of your turn,
Percy. Let's see, it's going to

03:48:07.506 --> 03:48:09.545
go ahead and use--

03:48:09.545 --> 03:48:13.961
TALIESIN: That's a lot of actions, this creature.

03:48:13.961 --> 03:48:21.939
MATT: It's legendary actions. It manipulates the
area around it. Because you are currently standing

03:48:21.939 --> 03:48:27.200
on the side there. No, you know what, it's going
to hold off. It's not going to do anything.

03:48:27.200 --> 03:48:28.528
Vax, you're up.

03:48:28.528 --> 03:48:30.571
TALIESIN: I haven't actually technically attacked
it.

03:48:30.571 --> 03:48:36.375
LIAM: I know what I want to do. You tell me what I
can do. First thing I want to do is cast Bless

03:48:36.375 --> 03:48:42.096
on-- I grab Vex, cast Bless on us and Pike, I have
a range of 30 feet on it.

03:48:42.096 --> 03:48:43.573
MATT: Okay.

03:48:43.573 --> 03:48:52.861
LIAM: Is that bonus? No, I don't want to do that.
I don't want to do that. I fly straight at Pike

03:48:52.861 --> 03:48:54.838
and I'm going to lift her up.

03:48:54.838 --> 03:49:02.777
MATT: Okay, you immediately take eight points of
fire damage by getting close to the flames to grab

03:49:02.777 --> 03:49:04.361
her. It's like (fire noises).

03:49:04.361 --> 03:49:09.639
LIAM: Sure. And then is it an action to grab and
an action to lift and carry over?

03:49:09.639 --> 03:49:15.298
MATT: I'd say it would be an action to grab her
enough, and you're going to move

03:49:15.298 --> 03:49:16.660
at half speed with her.

03:49:16.660 --> 03:49:18.547
LIAM: Which is still a ton at this point.

03:49:18.547 --> 03:49:19.885
MATT: Yeah.

03:49:19.885 --> 03:49:23.399
LIAM: And that's all I need is the action to grab
her and movement to go over?

03:49:23.399 --> 03:49:29.686
MATT: Action, and your movement there was about
there, I'd say you'll get your action and your

03:49:29.686 --> 03:49:32.238
movement will get you to up above the wall.

03:49:32.238 --> 03:49:41.022
LIAM: Okay. Action and movement will. All right,
then I will leave her on top of the wall, and I

03:49:41.022 --> 03:49:49.841
will use my bonus action to fly within range of
baby, and I should have one action left, yeah?

03:49:49.841 --> 03:49:52.944
Action, action, bonus action, hasted.

03:49:52.944 --> 03:49:58.689
MATT: Right. Hold on, no. You used an action to
pick up Pike. You brought her up there, you moved,

03:49:58.689 --> 03:50:08.879
you have another action and a bonus action. You
have an action and a bonus action. But the extra

03:50:08.879 --> 03:50:11.773
action that you have is from your haste, which
means it can be used for either

03:50:11.773 --> 03:50:13.172
a melee attack or ranged.

03:50:13.172 --> 03:50:18.071
LIAM: Great. So the bonus action I will use to
dash towards baby. And my final, hasted attack

03:50:18.071 --> 03:50:25.008
action, I will stay 30 feet away from the baby,
though, in the air, and I will throw Whisper with

03:50:25.008 --> 03:50:27.310
my last, hasted action.

03:50:27.310 --> 03:50:31.501
MATT: Okay. There you go. Put you down there.

03:50:31.501 --> 03:50:33.931
LIAM: And that's a 25, which hits, yeah?

03:50:33.931 --> 03:50:36.731
MATT: That hits. That just hits, yeah.

03:50:36.731 --> 03:50:42.303
LIAM: One, and can I dump Smite into this?

03:50:42.303 --> 03:50:44.060
MATT: If you'd like to, yeah.

03:50:44.060 --> 03:50:54.065
LIAM: I would like to. There's nine plus psychic
damage is 16 plus-- 20, 26, and here comes the

03:50:54.065 --> 03:51:05.049
sneak attack damage, 26, 27, 29, 30, 33, 37, 43,
47.

03:51:05.049 --> 03:51:13.930
MATT: 47? Nice. As you swipe down to (whoosh)
fling Whisper out, it slams right into the chest

03:51:13.930 --> 03:51:17.853
of the creature and it impales it off the back
side and there's the burst of divine energy

03:51:17.853 --> 03:51:22.195
inside, but you see the divine energy matches its
own, and what looks like a blow that would've

03:51:22.195 --> 03:51:29.982
killed the creature, it's like, (raspy inhale).
Turns back towards you, and gives another scream

03:51:29.982 --> 03:51:34.224
as the dagger returns to you. End of your turn?

03:51:34.224 --> 03:51:35.576
LIAM: That's the end of my turn.

03:51:35.576 --> 03:51:40.372
MATT: All right, at the end of your turn, it's
going to use its last legendary action. It's going

03:51:40.372 --> 03:51:44.372
to use another cold snap. You feel the air around
you, familiar, (whoosh) condense, and the ice

03:51:44.372 --> 03:51:48.102
cling to you. The air in your lungs freezes solid,
it seems. Go ahead and roll a

03:51:48.102 --> 03:51:50.217
constitution saving throw.

03:51:50.217 --> 03:51:55.513
LIAM: Going to use another Luck. 25.

03:51:55.513 --> 03:52:01.037
MATT: 25 will succeed, all right. So you shrug off
the stunned effect, but you do still suffer the

03:52:01.037 --> 03:52:20.619
halved damage. 13 points of cold damage. All
righty. Pike, you're up. Top of your turn, you

03:52:20.619 --> 03:52:24.131
suffer no damage, because you got out of the fire.
You're at the top of the wall now.

03:52:24.131 --> 03:52:35.227
ASHLEY: All right. If I climb down there, it's an
athletics thing?

03:52:35.227 --> 03:52:36.827
MATT: Yes.

03:52:36.827 --> 03:52:40.026
ASHLEY: Oh, okay. I'll climb down.

03:52:40.026 --> 03:52:43.888
MATT: Roll an athletics check. It's 40 feet down.
So that's going to be a long climb.

03:52:43.888 --> 03:52:45.674
ASHLEY: Okay.

03:52:45.674 --> 03:52:49.850
LAURA: Oh no.

03:52:49.850 --> 03:52:52.799
TRAVIS: Oh, is it really? Is it fucking really?

03:52:52.799 --> 03:52:55.328
MATT: It's a natural one?

03:52:55.328 --> 03:52:57.622
ASHLEY: Yeah.

03:52:57.622 --> 03:53:01.942
TRAVIS: Who put her on the top of a 40 foot wall?

03:53:01.942 --> 03:53:04.033
LAURA: Just picked her up and dropped her there.

03:53:04.033 --> 03:53:05.487
ASHLEY: Wait!

03:53:05.487 --> 03:53:07.342
LIAM: She can see and cast spells!

03:53:07.342 --> 03:53:09.174
ASHLEY: I have Feather Fall with my shield.

03:53:09.174 --> 03:53:15.336
MATT: You do. So you use your reaction to cast
Feather Fall on yourself as you stumble off the

03:53:15.336 --> 03:53:25.866
side, and as you plummet about 20 or so of the 40
feet (whoosh, soft impact) and you land unscathed

03:53:25.866 --> 03:53:27.299
on the ground.

03:53:27.299 --> 03:53:29.429
ASHLEY: Okay. Is that just my action?

03:53:29.429 --> 03:53:31.827
MATT: That's your reaction to do that. With the
shield.

03:53:31.827 --> 03:53:36.109
ASHLEY: Okay. How close am I to the baby? Can I
get to the baby?

03:53:36.109 --> 03:53:41.037
MATT: Not physically. It's over here and you're at
the base of the wall.

03:53:41.037 --> 03:53:42.729
LIAM: It's like 50 feet.

03:53:42.729 --> 03:53:43.744
ASHLEY: All right.

03:53:43.744 --> 03:53:45.342
MATT: You can get within range to it.

03:53:45.342 --> 03:53:49.825
ASHLEY: So you know what? I'm going to (sings)
Guiding Bolt the baby!

03:53:49.825 --> 03:53:51.981
MATT: Okay, what level?

03:53:51.981 --> 03:53:58.125
ASHLEY: Let's do five. 5th-level.

03:53:58.125 --> 03:54:02.548
MATT: Oh, shit, okay. Go ahead and roll for an
attack on that. Wait, is Guiding Bolt an attack?

03:54:02.548 --> 03:54:08.051
No, is it a saving throw? I think it's a saving
throw, isn't it? I always forget that. No, it's a

03:54:08.051 --> 03:54:11.948
ranged spell attack, so you have to roll to hit
it. Go ahead and roll a d20 and add your spell

03:54:11.948 --> 03:54:13.619
attack modifier.

03:54:13.619 --> 03:54:22.284
ASHLEY: It's not enough I don't think. 19? I will
use Guided Strike.

03:54:22.284 --> 03:54:26.632
MATT: Because you can do that! Guided Strike, you
get to add that to your own attack?

03:54:26.632 --> 03:54:27.996
ASHLEY: Yep.

03:54:27.996 --> 03:54:30.803
TRAVIS: Channel Divinity.

03:54:30.803 --> 03:54:43.284
MATT: (laughs) Still checking it. Guided Strike.
Yeah, plus ten to the roll. That'll do it. 29,

03:54:43.284 --> 03:54:45.893
boom. Go ahead and roll damage on that.

03:54:45.893 --> 03:54:48.904
ASHLEY: How many sixes? Let's see.

03:54:48.904 --> 03:54:52.677
MATT: Well it's four levels above that, so it's
8d6 radiant damage.

03:54:52.677 --> 03:55:06.858
ASHLEY: I'll get five, six, seven, eight. Okay, so
we've got six, 12. Help me out here, guys.

03:55:06.858 --> 03:55:09.444
18. Oh, wow.

03:55:09.444 --> 03:55:11.376
LAURA: You rolled a lot of sixes!

03:55:11.376 --> 03:55:12.906
ASHLEY: Whoa!

03:55:12.906 --> 03:55:19.428
TRAVIS: She rolled six sixes.

03:55:19.428 --> 03:55:21.837
MATT: Six sixes?

03:55:21.837 --> 03:55:23.928
MARISHA: What do you mean?

03:55:23.928 --> 03:55:25.789
LIAM: She rolled a ton of sixes.

03:55:25.789 --> 03:55:27.297
ASHLEY: 42.

03:55:27.297 --> 03:55:31.362
MATT: 42 points?

03:55:31.362 --> 03:55:35.997
TRAVIS: I'm looking at them.

03:55:35.997 --> 03:55:37.704
LAURA: They're all sixes.

03:55:37.704 --> 03:55:42.706
ASHLEY: We choose to kill this celestial baby not
because it is easy, but because it is hard!

03:55:42.706 --> 03:55:50.245
MATT: So as you land gently on the ground after
plummeting head over heels. (thuds, fire blast)

03:55:50.245 --> 03:55:55.437
Holding your holy symbol before you, you watch as
this beam of condensed divine energy rockets

03:55:55.437 --> 03:56:03.943
across, and this tiny, floating, withered planar
baby (fire blast) gets blasted. You watch as the

03:56:03.943 --> 03:56:08.328
wings get pushed back. It's holding itself in
place, but you see the dark shadow outline as the

03:56:08.328 --> 03:56:14.033
energy is blasting through it. As it hits, its
wings recoil, and it's still floating there, but

03:56:14.033 --> 03:56:17.746
you can see this sparkly outline of divine energy,
because the next attack on it has advantage.

03:56:17.746 --> 03:56:20.331
ASHLEY: Do I still have a bonus action?

03:56:20.331 --> 03:56:23.192
MATT: You do. Your sword's still up.

03:56:23.192 --> 03:56:25.639
ASHLEY: I'll use the spiritual weapon.

03:56:25.639 --> 03:56:28.767
MATT: Spiritual weapon, you can move 20 feet as a
bonus action. It moves up and takes a swipe. Go

03:56:28.767 --> 03:56:30.718
ahead and roll an attack.

03:56:30.718 --> 03:56:33.961
ASHLEY: Oh crap, my boots are stuck together. How
is this happening? Okay.

03:56:33.961 --> 03:56:37.192
Yeah, the hook on the top there.

03:56:37.192 --> 03:56:40.189
LAURA: That's how she fell off the wall.

03:56:40.189 --> 03:56:47.401
ASHLEY: Ooh. That's a 29.

03:56:47.401 --> 03:56:55.629
MATT: 29 hits! Yeah, so go ahead and roll the
damage for the spiritual weapon, which is 1d8 plus

03:56:55.629 --> 03:56:59.090
five, I think, for you. Whatever your wisdom
modifier is.

03:56:59.090 --> 03:57:05.870
ASHLEY: Sorry, guys. I don't know what I'm doing.
Oh, that's not a lot. Seven.

03:57:05.870 --> 03:57:11.106
MATT: Seven points of damage. It all helps. All
righty. Keyleth, you're up.

03:57:11.106 --> 03:57:13.350
MARISHA: I'm underground, right?

03:57:13.350 --> 03:57:18.314
MATT: You're underground, you are restrained, you
are blind. You cannot see anything.

03:57:18.314 --> 03:57:21.428
MARISHA: (growls) I'm going to go earth
elemental.

03:57:21.428 --> 03:57:22.933
MATT: Okay!

03:57:22.933 --> 03:57:27.356
TALIESIN: I'm amazed he didn't already have it out
of the bag.

03:57:27.356 --> 03:57:41.664
MATT: And with that ability, you get an
earthglide, and this is a non-issue for you. All

03:57:41.664 --> 03:57:52.268
righty, Keyleth. So you are an earth elemental.

03:57:52.268 --> 03:57:54.157
TRAVIS: Damn!

03:57:54.157 --> 03:57:57.644
MARISHA: Do I have enough movement to earthglide
to them?

03:57:57.644 --> 03:57:59.010
MATT: What's your speed?

03:57:59.010 --> 03:58:00.719
MARISHA: I think 60, earthglide?

03:58:00.719 --> 03:58:05.329
MATT: 60, earthglide? Yeah, totally. You're moving
into melee with the baby?

03:58:05.329 --> 03:58:13.322
MARISHA: Okay, can I come up from underground,
grab them, and then beat them into the ground?

03:58:13.322 --> 03:58:15.683
MATT: Sure. Go ahead and roll a slam attack.

03:58:15.683 --> 03:58:17.278
TALIESIN: Puny god!

03:58:17.278 --> 03:58:22.842
MATT: Make two slam attacks, so roll twice. It's
plus eight to attack each time.

03:58:22.842 --> 03:58:31.227
MARISHA: That's cocked. Natural 20 on that one,
and a four on a second one, which is 12.

03:58:31.227 --> 03:58:32.654
MATT: Yeah, that misses.

03:58:32.654 --> 03:58:34.936
MARISHA; Okay, but that one is a natural 20.

03:58:34.936 --> 03:58:38.887
MATT: As you reach up out of the ground from
underneath, (impact noise) your fingers clasp

03:58:38.887 --> 03:58:45.996
around the celestial baby and (whack) slam it into
the ground as hard as you can. Go ahead and roll

03:58:45.996 --> 03:58:51.665
damage on that. 2d8 plus five, so roll the 2d8.

03:58:51.665 --> 03:58:54.085
MARISHA: And then you double the 2d8.

03:58:54.085 --> 03:59:00.117
MATT: You double whatever you rol for the 2d8 and
then add plus five. Crit that baby. It's our next

03:59:00.191 --> 03:59:02.099
t-shirt: Crit that baby!

03:59:02.099 --> 03:59:08.791
MARISHA: Six doubled, which is 12, plus five
doubled, which is ten, so that's 22.

03:59:08.791 --> 03:59:10.985
MATT: The bonus isn't doubled. Just the dice.

03:59:10.985 --> 03:59:16.273
MARISHA: I know. Just the dice is 22, plus five.
So 27.

03:59:16.273 --> 03:59:23.169
MATT: That's great. 27 points of damage. (wham)
Slamming onto the ground. As your hand retracts

03:59:23.169 --> 03:59:29.729
up, you can see the wings are-- as it starts to
fly up, it (gasps).

03:59:29.729 --> 03:59:34.572
MARISHA: And I just want to hold onto it and be
like, yo! Yo, air elemental! And then let my air

03:59:34.572 --> 03:59:38.684
elemental come over and do its thing. Double slam
attack.

03:59:38.684 --> 03:59:39.876
MATT: Go for it.

03:59:39.876 --> 03:59:48.760
MARISHA: Slam attack. No, I'm going to do a multi
attack. Two slam attacks. So 2d8 plus eight, once

03:59:48.760 --> 03:59:54.192
again. That's an 18 and a 17. Plus eight.

03:59:54.192 --> 03:59:55.818
MATT: 18 and 17 plus eight?

03:59:55.818 --> 03:59:58.261
MARISHA: Yeah, so 26 and 25.

03:59:58.261 --> 04:00:00.486
MATT: Both hit. Go ahead and roll damage.

04:00:00.486 --> 04:00:17.515
MARISHA: Which is 3d8 plus two. So the first one,
oh! Six, seven, eight, plus seven, which is 15.

04:00:17.515 --> 04:00:29.893
For the first one, 15 plus two. 17. And then the
second one is eight, plus two fives, which is 18

04:00:29.893 --> 04:00:31.971
plus two, so 20.

04:00:31.971 --> 04:00:33.332
MATT: Nice.

04:00:33.332 --> 04:00:35.973
TALIESIN: And he gets flung in a random
direction?

04:00:35.973 --> 04:00:44.679
MATT: No, this was just hitting it. (impacts) All
righty. That's the end of your turn? All right. As

04:00:44.679 --> 04:00:51.561
it comes back to the entity's turn, it's looking
really, really rough. And as part of that, it's

04:00:51.561 --> 04:01:02.037
going to reach into itself. Its hands push into
its torso, and as it screams, (raspy scream) it

04:01:02.037 --> 04:01:05.910
gives out this horrible scream as it tears some of
its chest open, and from the inside, where you

04:01:05.910 --> 04:01:12.212
imagine it would be a ribcage, it's this
impossibly bright light that echoes out in a

04:01:12.212 --> 04:01:18.997
shockwave, affecting everybody except for Vex,
actually. I need everybody else to make a

04:01:18.997 --> 04:01:20.786
constitution saving throw.

04:01:20.786 --> 04:01:21.829
TALIESIN: All of us?

04:01:21.829 --> 04:01:23.047
MATT: Yes.

04:01:23.047 --> 04:01:26.582
SAM: Oh boy. That don't look good.

04:01:26.582 --> 04:01:29.091
TALIESIN: We don't have advantage on this, do we?

04:01:29.091 --> 04:01:30.179
MATT: Nope!

04:01:30.179 --> 04:01:33.774
TALIESIN: I'm going to burn a Resolve.

04:01:33.774 --> 04:01:44.464
MARISHA: Constitution: that's part of my physical
stats as being an elemental, correct? It's con,

04:01:44.464 --> 04:01:48.311
strength, and dex. Never mind. Yeah.

04:01:48.311 --> 04:01:53.737
MATT: So?

04:01:53.737 --> 04:01:54.868
SAM: 22.

04:01:54.868 --> 04:01:56.422
MATT: 22. That succeeds.

04:01:56.422 --> 04:01:57.700
TALIESIN: 17.

04:01:57.700 --> 04:01:59.162
MARISHA: 15.

04:01:59.162 --> 04:02:00.170
LIAM: 24.

04:02:00.170 --> 04:02:04.676
MATT: That succeeds. Pike?

04:02:04.676 --> 04:02:06.498
ASHLEY: 11.

04:02:06.498 --> 04:02:07.462
MATT: Okay.

04:02:07.462 --> 04:02:08.411
TRAVIS: 25.

04:02:08.411 --> 04:02:14.282
MATT: Succeeds. Everyone who succeeds, you suffer
48 points of radiant damage.

04:02:14.282 --> 04:02:15.890
SAM: Radiant damage?

04:02:15.890 --> 04:02:16.935
MATT: Yes.

04:02:16.935 --> 04:02:21.852
LIAM: 48 on a success. Whoa.

04:02:21.852 --> 04:02:25.272
MATT: If you failed, you took 96 points of radiant
damage.

04:02:25.272 --> 04:02:31.824
TALIESIN: Wait, that's magical. I have advantage.
The cloak wouldn't--

04:02:31.824 --> 04:02:34.464
MATT: The cloak doesn't say a spell effect?

04:02:34.464 --> 04:02:39.139
TALIESIN: Against spells and other magical
effects.

04:02:39.139 --> 04:02:45.000
MATT: Technically, because it's not a leveled
spell, it's just a radiant blast, it would not

04:02:45.000 --> 04:02:45.807
affect it.

04:02:45.807 --> 04:02:47.450
TALIESIN: It wouldn't have given me advantage on
that save?

04:02:47.450 --> 04:02:48.515
MATT: No, it wouldn't.

04:02:48.515 --> 04:02:51.521
ASHLEY: 96, you said?

04:02:51.521 --> 04:03:00.426
MATT: 96 points of radiant damage. So Keyleth, I
need you-- your elemental has gone berserk.

04:03:00.426 --> 04:03:02.042
MARISHA: There's no way.

04:03:02.042 --> 04:03:04.187
MATT: Aside of rolling a 20. Go for it. Just try.

04:03:04.187 --> 04:03:11.464
MARISHA: Unless I roll a nat 20? They just do
their own thing if you fail.

04:03:11.464 --> 04:03:15.040
TRAVIS: What do you got to roll, a 20? Percy,
bless that shit.

04:03:15.040 --> 04:03:19.154
MATT: Even so, I'm letting you have this
opportunity.

04:03:19.154 --> 04:03:22.562
MARISHA: I rolled a 19.

04:03:22.562 --> 04:03:29.161
MATT: Nope. So as the Conjure Elemental spell
fails, the control of your elemental shifts, and

04:03:29.161 --> 04:03:32.411
now it's aggressively turning its attention
towards you and the rest of your party.

04:03:32.411 --> 04:03:36.277
MARISHA: Can I not fade it after this? Oh, I can
drop concentration on it

04:03:36.277 --> 04:03:39.011
and then it will go away, right?

04:03:39.011 --> 04:03:41.074
MATT: No. That's not how this works.

04:03:41.074 --> 04:03:42.561
TRAVIS: Did you just put--

04:03:42.561 --> 04:03:44.045
LIAM: A new enemy on the map.

04:03:44.045 --> 04:03:46.608
SAM: A new opponent enters.

04:03:46.608 --> 04:03:51.682
MARISHA: To be fair, didn't it also get affected
by the blast?

04:03:51.682 --> 04:03:59.941
MATT: Yeah, actually. Roll a constitution saving
throw for the air elemental. It's a plus two.

04:03:59.941 --> 04:04:08.059
MARISHA: I rolled a 13, plus two, so 15.

04:04:08.059 --> 04:04:12.737
MATT: The air elemental is actually destroyed. To
your advantage, strangely.

04:04:12.737 --> 04:04:17.518
MARISHA: It only has 90 hit points, so it's fine,
guys! It's fine.

04:04:17.518 --> 04:04:27.327
MATT: All right, so the entity looks like it's
barely hanging on, and you see parts of its

04:04:27.327 --> 04:04:32.265
internal body falling out from where it tore its
chest open. It's going to use a bonus action to

04:04:32.265 --> 04:04:42.102
Misty Step out of this vicinity over to here. It's
going to use its movement to fly high up, almost

04:04:42.102 --> 04:04:52.334
trying to escape the cavern now. It's up in that
region right there. We'll say, here. On top of

04:04:52.334 --> 04:04:55.159
this. Turn that away.

04:04:55.159 --> 04:04:57.542
LAURA: Oh, look how teeny! I can finally see it.

04:04:57.542 --> 04:04:59.152
ASHLEY: Above a fountain.

04:04:59.152 --> 04:05:00.997
LIAM: It's a faerie dragon.

04:05:00.997 --> 04:05:02.203
LAURA: It's so teeny.

04:05:02.203 --> 04:05:03.973
MATT: All righty. Vex, you're up.

04:05:03.973 --> 04:05:10.985
LAURA: I guess I'll fly up so I can see over the
wall. I have no idea what's going on.

04:05:10.985 --> 04:05:15.210
MATT: You fly up and you see everyone below is
wrecked, the ground is charred with some sort of a

04:05:15.210 --> 04:05:22.732
radiant blast. You watched it flash over the wall
itself, like a small, rapid recreation of the

04:05:22.732 --> 04:05:27.563
intro of Akira. (boom) This big, arcing ball of
white energy.

04:05:27.563 --> 04:05:31.630
LAURA: Wow. Can I Hunter's Mark the baby?

04:05:31.630 --> 04:05:32.699
MATT: Sure.

04:05:32.699 --> 04:05:51.501
LAURA: And then I'm going to try to shoot the baby
with my Blazing Bowstring. That would be a 30. And

04:05:51.501 --> 04:05:53.466
I'm going to make it a bramble shot.

04:05:53.466 --> 04:05:54.838
MATT: Okay.

04:05:54.838 --> 04:05:58.636
LIAM: Ball of vines in the air.

04:05:58.636 --> 04:06:00.499
LAURA: DC of 17.

04:06:00.499 --> 04:06:02.647
MATT: Strength?

04:06:02.647 --> 04:06:03.814
LAURA: Yeah.

04:06:03.814 --> 04:06:05.651
MATT: I actually rolled a natural 17.

04:06:05.651 --> 04:06:07.645
LAURA: Motherfucker. Okay, well.

04:06:07.645 --> 04:06:09.018
MATT: But it still takes the damage.

04:06:09.018 --> 04:06:27.523
LAURA: Still 4d8 extra. Well. 17, plus five is 22,
plus eight is 30, plus two is 32, plus 1d6

04:06:27.523 --> 04:06:37.740
lightning damage... 35, plus 1d6 for Hunter's Mark
is 40.

04:06:37.740 --> 04:06:44.166
MATT: 40, nice! So as it hits, you watch as the
brambles try and wrap around it, but it actually

04:06:44.166 --> 04:06:45.396
flies free.

04:06:45.396 --> 04:06:50.580
LAURA: Oh wait! Plus the blazing bowstring,
another two fire damage.

04:06:50.580 --> 04:06:58.714
MATT: 42 total. You can see more of it's just
falling out of its small, decomposing torso, and

04:06:58.714 --> 04:07:03.637
it's trying to fly upward now, towards the light.
It's on the edge.

04:07:03.637 --> 04:07:06.154
LAURA: I want to try to do the same thing again.

04:07:06.154 --> 04:07:07.470
MATT: Okay, go for it.

04:07:07.470 --> 04:07:13.873
LAURA: With a Blazing Bowstring again. 28.

04:07:13.873 --> 04:07:15.310
MATT: 28 hits. Roll damage.

04:07:15.310 --> 04:07:25.661
LAURA: Okay, bramble shot again, because I get
two, motherfucker! That's ten for my Blazing

04:07:25.661 --> 04:07:56.114
Bowstring. Oh, Jesus H. Macy. 19, plus five is 24,
plus eight is 32, 36. Oh my god, 34. 38,

04:07:56.114 --> 04:08:01.204
plus ten is 48.

04:08:01.204 --> 04:08:02.596
MATT: How do you want to do this?

04:08:02.596 --> 04:08:04.615
(cheering)

04:08:04.615 --> 04:08:08.491
TRAVIS: Frozen no more! Freeze me at your peril!

04:08:08.491 --> 04:08:14.827
LAURA: Be free, little angel baby. We shall feast
tonight! That's so gross.

04:08:14.827 --> 04:08:18.845
And I just shoot the baby.

04:08:18.845 --> 04:08:27.780
MATT: All right. As you pull back as it's
fluttering up, you take aim and release, and as

04:08:27.780 --> 04:08:34.234
the arrow strikes it, you can see, the same way
the dagger hit the baby, it hits it, and throws

04:08:34.234 --> 04:08:38.795
it, the sheer force of the arrow against the wall,
and pins it there like it's stapled to the rock.

04:08:38.795 --> 04:08:46.087
As it reaches over to try and pull the arrow out,
and it begins to, suddenly the arrow (whoosh)

04:08:46.087 --> 04:08:50.683
breaks into a bunch of bramble vines that begin to
wrap around it, and you watch as the tiny baby arm

04:08:50.683 --> 04:08:57.595
and wing try and reach out (choking) as it
constricts and twists and slowly constrains it

04:08:57.595 --> 04:09:05.429
until you see it (crack) pop and go limp on the
inside of the vines. And as the vines unfurl, what

04:09:05.429 --> 04:09:14.804
was physically there is slowly dissipating into a
glitter-like powder. The body dissipating and

04:09:14.804 --> 04:09:16.046
falling apart.

04:09:16.046 --> 04:09:17.858
LAURA: I mean, it was an evil baby, right?

04:09:17.858 --> 04:09:19.109
TRAVIS: Yeah, nobody likes glitter.

04:09:19.109 --> 04:09:20.952
MARISHA: Yeah, glitter gets everywhere.

04:09:20.952 --> 04:09:25.501
LAURA: Should we get out of here?

04:09:25.501 --> 04:09:27.923
TRAVIS: (muffled) I don't mean to be rude!

04:09:27.923 --> 04:09:33.203
MARISHA: I run over to Grog. I'm still an
elemental, yeah? I am still an elemental.

04:09:33.203 --> 04:09:34.502
Where is he?

04:09:34.502 --> 04:09:35.866
MATT: You don't know, actually.

04:09:35.866 --> 04:09:39.249
SAM: I saw it. I'll point down.

04:09:39.249 --> 04:09:41.767
MARISHA: You point. I earthglide and I find him.

04:09:41.767 --> 04:09:42.896
MATT: Okay.

04:09:42.896 --> 04:09:47.003
MARISHA: And I can do double damage to structures.
Can I beat him out?

04:09:47.003 --> 04:09:51.173
MATT: I'd say you could probably, over time, yeah.
You have enough constitution to be fine.

04:09:51.173 --> 04:09:53.490
MARISHA: I don't want to kill him by suffocating.

04:09:53.490 --> 04:09:57.086
MATT: No, he's fine. He can hold his breath for
six minutes. He's got a really high constitution,

04:09:57.086 --> 04:10:03.606
so you're fine. You slowly pummel the rock out
from his way and pull Grog out from the interior

04:10:03.606 --> 04:10:05.123
of the stone floor.

04:10:05.123 --> 04:10:08.886
TALIESIN: Yeah, we should head out and bug bomb
the place.

04:10:08.886 --> 04:10:10.270
TRAVIS: Don't we need proof?

04:10:10.270 --> 04:10:11.574
TALIESIN: Grab the body. Let's go.

04:10:11.574 --> 04:10:13.001
SAM: There's no body!

04:10:13.001 --> 04:10:19.725
MARISHA: I go over to the glitter and I get some
of my potion bottles from my alchemy to--

04:10:19.725 --> 04:10:25.234
Oh, I'm actually good at this. I try and
harvest some, sweep some glitter.

04:10:25.234 --> 04:10:29.397
MATT: Okay. So you gather some glitter in.

04:10:29.463 --> 04:10:33.745
TALIESIN: Really quick, just look around, is there
anything of value to grab before we run?

04:10:33.745 --> 04:10:35.576
MATT: Make an investigation check.

04:10:35.576 --> 04:10:36.987
SAM: I'll look, too.

04:10:36.987 --> 04:10:42.603
LAURA: While she's doing that, can I just look
over the ground and see

04:10:42.653 --> 04:10:45.185
if there's any platinum deposits?

04:10:45.185 --> 04:10:48.399
SAM: We could do a quick mining.

04:10:48.399 --> 04:10:51.804
MATT: I mean, there are a number of visible edges
of veins.

04:10:51.804 --> 04:10:54.862
LIAM: Is there 230,000 gold worth?

04:10:54.862 --> 04:10:58.127
SAM: Probably. We could stay here for a couple
months.

04:10:58.127 --> 04:11:06.213
MATT: In this whole mine, there's a lot of
platinum, but you have to mine it. And as you guys

04:11:06.213 --> 04:11:18.773
are having this moment, you begin to hear the loud
sound of hundreds of large insect-like creatures

04:11:18.773 --> 04:11:21.015
climbing their way down the walls.

04:11:21.015 --> 04:11:23.494
LAURA: Oh god. Get to the middle and get in the
air.

04:11:23.494 --> 04:11:27.776
MARISHA: Okay, so I get everybody in the middle.
Is everyone ready?

04:11:27.776 --> 04:11:29.026
TRAVIS: I need help.

04:11:29.026 --> 04:11:30.493
TALIESIN: We pulled you out.

04:11:30.493 --> 04:11:32.267
MARISHA: What do you mean, you need help?

04:11:32.267 --> 04:11:34.063
TRAVIS: I'm on the other side of the 40-foot wall
from the carpet.

04:11:34.063 --> 04:11:40.006
MARISHA: I go (boom) and I pull Grog through.

04:11:40.006 --> 04:11:44.505
LAURA: No, the carpet. We just got to get the
carpet. I can go down and grab the carpet.

04:11:44.505 --> 04:11:49.596
MARISHA: Oh, the carpet. I take a few minutes as
my earth elemental self to beast through...

04:11:49.596 --> 04:11:51.293
LAURA: We don't have a few minutes.

04:11:51.293 --> 04:11:53.064
MARISHA: I can do double damage to structures.

04:11:53.064 --> 04:11:56.591
LAURA: You don't have to do that. I can go get the
carpet. I'm right there.

04:11:56.591 --> 04:11:58.340
MARISHA: Oh, okay. Go get the carpet.

04:11:58.340 --> 04:12:02.050
MATT: Okay. So you rush over and grab the carpet.
And you guys begin to make

04:12:02.050 --> 04:12:03.685
your way back up through.

04:12:03.685 --> 04:12:05.405
LAURA: Are we bamfing out or are we flying up?

04:12:05.405 --> 04:12:09.277
TALIESIN: I think we're flying up and if we see
anything we'll just take shots at anything that's

04:12:09.277 --> 04:12:13.812
rolling around, if anything is visible. Let's just
do damage on our way out.

04:12:13.812 --> 04:12:17.053
MARISHA: Oh, we're doing damage as we fly out.

04:12:17.053 --> 04:12:18.441
LIAM: Or we could Tree Stride out?

04:12:18.441 --> 04:12:20.449
TALIESIN: We can't Tree Stride. There's no trees.

04:12:20.449 --> 04:12:24.423
LAURA: Or we can Plane Shift.

04:12:24.423 --> 04:12:28.787
MATT: There is a small tree growing out of the
side of the wall from where you killed the

04:12:28.787 --> 04:12:31.791
creature, but it's not large enough for that
spell.

04:12:31.791 --> 04:12:33.959
LAURA: But still really cool!

04:12:33.959 --> 04:12:37.299
MATT: Yeah, it grows and twists out, like a bonsai
curves upward.

04:12:37.299 --> 04:12:40.737
LAURA: I hope that it slowly becomes a forest
underground.

04:12:40.737 --> 04:12:43.576
TRAVIS: They're going to chop it down as they mine
the platinum.

04:12:43.576 --> 04:12:47.669
MATT: All right, so you guys are coasting up
through the shaft?

04:12:47.669 --> 04:12:49.855
MARISHA: Oh, are we just riding up?

04:12:49.855 --> 04:12:51.962
TRAVIS: Straight up.

04:12:51.962 --> 04:12:53.734
MARISHA: Broom and carpet? Broom and carpet.

04:12:53.734 --> 04:13:00.031
MATT: Okay. You guys begin heading up through the
center column of this opening. As you're moving

04:13:00.031 --> 04:13:04.294
up, are you staying in the darkness?

04:13:04.294 --> 04:13:08.049
LAURA: Can you Daylight or something, like up and
out?

04:13:08.049 --> 04:13:10.173
MARISHA: I can. Do we need to?

04:13:10.173 --> 04:13:14.027
TALIESIN: You know, at this point, it might be.

04:13:14.027 --> 04:13:18.542
MARISHA: On the top of my spire I cast Daylight.

04:13:18.542 --> 04:13:26.018
MATT: Okay. So (boom) this light now emerges from
this area, and as you can see now through this

04:13:26.018 --> 04:13:39.098
cavern around you, there's about a dozen or so of
these large ankheg creatures, about every 30 feet

04:13:39.098 --> 04:13:46.734
or so, 40 feet up. You're in the center of-- you
look up and you can see easily the hundred that

04:13:46.734 --> 04:13:50.950
you saw earlier have all been drawn to the surface
by the screams of this creature. And as you begin

04:13:50.950 --> 04:13:55.125
rocketing up with this Daylight spell, you watch
as some of them start hanging upward in your

04:13:55.125 --> 04:13:58.503
direction. You start hearing this sound, (hiss).

04:13:58.503 --> 04:14:02.910
MARISHA: Are they attracted to the Daylight?

04:14:02.910 --> 04:14:10.513
MATT: They're apparently attracted to your
presence. It is a line shot. I'm going to go ahead

04:14:10.513 --> 04:14:19.042
and have, let's see here. Percy and Vex, I need
you guys to both make a

04:14:19.042 --> 04:14:21.355
constitution saving throw.

04:14:21.355 --> 04:14:35.527
TRAVIS: Oh shit. Oh god, we did not-- pretty sure
you said that last time, before you turned into

04:14:35.527 --> 04:14:36.941
Chef Boyardee.

04:14:36.941 --> 04:14:39.346
MATT: Sorry, sorry, not constitution. Dexterity,
my apologies.

04:14:39.346 --> 04:14:42.288
LAURA: Dexterity saving throw? That is so much
better.

04:14:42.288 --> 04:14:45.859
TALIESIN: Should I reroll? Yeah, I'll reroll.

04:14:45.859 --> 04:14:48.048
LAURA: Should you reroll?

04:14:48.048 --> 04:14:49.757
MATT: Yeah, roll again; it's fine.

04:14:49.757 --> 04:14:51.854
LAURA: 27.

04:14:51.854 --> 04:14:53.635
TALIESIN: 18.

04:14:53.635 --> 04:14:57.798
MATT: Yeah, you both make it. So you both suffer
eight points of acid damage.

04:14:57.798 --> 04:15:06.789
TALIESIN: I want to start taking shots as high up
as I can see,

04:15:06.789 --> 04:15:08.980
I want to start taking shots at these things.

04:15:08.980 --> 04:15:10.823
LAURA: Yeah, I'll do the same thing.

04:15:10.823 --> 04:15:17.318
MATT: There are over a hundred. And they take more
than a few shots to go. We'll say you start

04:15:17.389 --> 04:15:21.272
picking them off, a few as you go, but you watch
them fall past you. There's just such a mass

04:15:21.272 --> 04:15:28.054
number of them. As you guys get up another 40 or
so feet, (spray sound) again. From three different

04:15:28.054 --> 04:15:34.350
ones. All right, I need Taryon, Percival, and Vex
again to make dexterity saving throws.

04:15:34.350 --> 04:15:35.713
SAM: Natural 20!

04:15:35.713 --> 04:15:37.585
MATT and TRAVIS: Nice!

04:15:37.585 --> 04:15:41.290
TALIESIN: I'll live with that. 17.

04:15:41.290 --> 04:15:42.651
MATT: Okay.

04:15:42.651 --> 04:15:44.865
LAURA: 23.

04:15:44.865 --> 04:15:47.369
MATT: Okay, six points of acid damage to the three
of you.

04:15:47.369 --> 04:15:49.792
SAM: Halved to three for me.

04:15:49.792 --> 04:15:55.802
MATT: You make your way up even further. You're
about halfway up this tunnel at this point and now

04:15:55.802 --> 04:16:06.964
you're getting to the heavy cluster of these
creatures. At this point, a large cluster of them

04:16:06.964 --> 04:16:22.898
begin to spray all across. I need all of you guys
to make two dexterity saving throws. Anybody get

04:16:22.898 --> 04:16:24.587
lower than a 13?

04:16:24.587 --> 04:16:25.528
TALIESIN: Nope.

04:16:25.528 --> 04:16:27.312
ASHLEY and TRAVIS: I did.

04:16:27.312 --> 04:16:28.428
MATT: For one?

04:16:28.428 --> 04:16:29.854
TRAVIS: For the second one.

04:16:29.854 --> 04:16:31.170
MARISHA: Lower than a 13?

04:16:31.170 --> 04:16:39.759
MATT: Yeah. That would be all of you except for
Pike and Grog take a total of 14 points of acid

04:16:39.759 --> 04:16:49.743
damage. Both of you guys, for the purposes of
this, take 21 points of acid damage.

04:16:49.743 --> 04:16:52.448
SAM: You okay there, Pikey-pants?

04:16:52.448 --> 04:16:54.692
ASHLEY: Yeah, I'm fine!

04:16:54.692 --> 04:16:55.899
TRAVIS: I'm okay.

04:16:55.899 --> 04:17:00.767
MATT: As you're shooting and you hear the gunfire
(gunshots) going off, you fire the arrows. More

04:17:00.767 --> 04:17:04.591
and more of these ankhegs are falling and
crumbling off. You hear the (screeching) as they

04:17:04.642 --> 04:17:08.519
streak past you, plummeting into the darkness
below. Even more so, throwing streams out.

04:17:08.519 --> 04:17:11.072
However, their numbers are starting to thin
because you've gone past the thick part of it.

04:17:11.072 --> 04:17:27.383
Vax, Pike, and Grog. The three of you guys roll
dexterity saving throws, please.

04:17:27.383 --> 04:17:34.780
TRAVIS: 12.

04:17:34.780 --> 04:17:35.775
LIAM: 19.

04:17:35.775 --> 04:17:36.764
ASHLEY: 18.

04:17:36.764 --> 04:17:37.762
TRAVIS: 12.

04:17:37.762 --> 04:17:42.640
MATT: All right. Six points of acid damage, six points
of acid damage, 12 points of acid damage.

04:17:42.706 --> 04:17:46.736
LAURA: How much further do we have to go up?!

04:17:46.736 --> 04:17:53.271
MATT: You guys, with the brooms and the carpet,
it's not super fast. Putting up there again. You

04:17:53.271 --> 04:17:54.780
get about three-quarters of the way up.

04:17:54.780 --> 04:17:56.033
SAM: What is Pike riding on?

04:17:56.033 --> 04:17:57.437
MATT: She's on the carpet.

04:17:57.437 --> 04:17:59.196
ASHLEY: I'm on the carpet. I'm okay.

04:17:59.196 --> 04:18:00.885
LAURA: You should heal yourself!

04:18:00.885 --> 04:18:01.841
ASHLEY: I know.

04:18:01.841 --> 04:18:04.686
MARISHA: Can I do a Wind Wall to protect us from
around us?

04:18:04.686 --> 04:18:10.066
MATT: Wind Wall is stationary. It might help with
one round of the spray.

04:18:10.066 --> 04:18:12.525
MARISHA: Are we doing one more round?

04:18:12.525 --> 04:18:15.650
MATT: You'll find out. You don't know.

04:18:15.650 --> 04:18:21.070
MARISHA: If we are, I will prep my Wind Wall spell
to encompass us for one more round.

04:18:21.070 --> 04:18:25.315
MATT: Okay. As you guys are heading upward, now
you're about three-quarters of the way out. The

04:18:25.315 --> 04:18:29.216
numbers are thinning a little bit. They start
spraying once more. You go ahead and create a Wind

04:18:29.216 --> 04:18:36.013
Wall that you've been preparing. As you watch,
these jets of extremely acidic burning liquid

04:18:36.013 --> 04:18:41.912
shoot toward you, suddenly a column of wind gets
conjured upward from the darkness and deflects the

04:18:41.912 --> 04:18:47.340
spray into a mist that is thrown back against the
wall harmlessly. You're almost to the exit, and

04:18:47.340 --> 04:18:57.779
you see a handful more towards the very top of
this cavern. Keyleth, Percy, and Pike. Make a

04:18:57.779 --> 04:18:59.580
dexterity saving throw, if you can.

04:18:59.580 --> 04:19:01.447
SAM: Pikey.

04:19:01.447 --> 04:19:04.566
MARISHA: I'm good. 21.

04:19:04.566 --> 04:19:07.734
TALIESIN: I'm going to burn a reroll. It's the end
of my resolves!

04:19:07.734 --> 04:19:10.687
ASHLEY: Oh! Natural 20.

04:19:10.687 --> 04:19:12.960
TALIESIN: Ten.

04:19:12.960 --> 04:19:18.884
MATT: Okay, so eight points of acid damage. 16.
Keyleth?

04:19:18.884 --> 04:19:21.135
MARISHA: 21.

04:19:21.135 --> 04:19:27.148
MATT: All right. That's eight points of acid
damage. You took the--

04:19:27.148 --> 04:19:29.441
ASHLEY: Eight.

04:19:29.441 --> 04:19:34.730
MATT: The eight, yeah. As you guys just crest out
of the top of the dark column below, you can watch

04:19:34.730 --> 04:19:39.888
as the creatures are starting to skitter out from
the edges, but you are far above and a few of them

04:19:39.888 --> 04:19:45.346
are spraying, but you're above the range and it's
coasting over and disappearing below. You've now

04:19:45.346 --> 04:19:49.517
emerged into the night sky, the moonlight above
you. You're all fairly beaten.

04:19:49.517 --> 04:19:54.287
TALIESIN: Is there anything we can throw down
there to really piss them off?

04:19:54.287 --> 04:20:00.027
SAM: I'll drop a bead of Firewall.

04:20:00.027 --> 04:20:02.577
MARISHA: Yeah, and I can drop a Fireball on
there.

04:20:02.577 --> 04:20:04.891
SAM: I'm sorry, a Wall of Fire.

04:20:04.891 --> 04:20:07.380
MATT: You're going to throw a Wall of Fire on the
edge of it?

04:20:07.380 --> 04:20:08.317
SAM: Yeah.

04:20:08.317 --> 04:20:14.135
MARISHA: Yeah, and I'll throw a Fireball. Burn the
place down. Extermination.

04:20:14.135 --> 04:20:15.911
TALIESIN: Bug bomb.

04:20:15.911 --> 04:20:17.646
TRAVIS: I spit in the hole.

04:20:17.646 --> 04:20:23.608
ASHLEY: I was going to see if I could put a Blade
Barrier on top of the hole, so once the fire's in

04:20:23.678 --> 04:20:25.360
there, they can't get out.

04:20:25.360 --> 04:20:27.403
MATT: What's the radius on Blade Barrier?

04:20:27.403 --> 04:20:36.137
ASHLEY: 90 feet.

04:20:36.137 --> 04:20:41.423
MATT: Okay, we'll say as you come out the top, you
throw down the Blade Barrier-- what's the radius

04:20:41.423 --> 04:20:42.382
of it, though?

04:20:42.382 --> 04:20:44.313
ASHLEY: I don't think it says.

04:20:44.313 --> 04:20:45.485
MATT: I'll pull it up real fast.

04:20:45.485 --> 04:20:47.481
ASHLEY: Oh, it does say.

04:20:47.519 --> 04:20:54.617
LAURA: 60 feet in diameter. No! You can make a
straight wall of 100 feet or 60 feet in diameter.

04:20:54.617 --> 04:20:56.296
ASHLEY: Yeah, ringed wall up to 60 feet.

04:20:56.296 --> 04:21:01.012
MATT: Okay, so you can make a wall around the one
side of it. Not the whole thing.

04:21:01.012 --> 04:21:02.251
SAM: Wall of Fire around the other?

04:21:02.251 --> 04:21:11.759
MATT: You don't get to get the whole radius, but
between the Wall of Fire and the bladed wall, you

04:21:11.759 --> 04:21:20.329
blast the opening there. You coast away, watching
and hearing as dozens of ankhegs that are climbing

04:21:20.329 --> 04:21:28.659
up to the top begin to (screeching). Eventually,
they all begin to burrow back into the rock and

04:21:28.659 --> 04:21:34.152
stone and vanish. The ones on the surface begin to
burrow below. And a calm stillness comes over the

04:21:34.152 --> 04:21:39.335
exterior of the mines. As you all coast up,
hundreds of feet in the air over the forest,

04:21:39.335 --> 04:21:44.837
licking your wounds. So you removed the glitter
and you removed--

04:21:44.837 --> 04:21:46.217
LAURA: The little coffin.

04:21:46.217 --> 04:21:49.768
MATT: The little stone placard. You had to wedge
it out, but you got it up there.

04:21:49.768 --> 04:21:50.727
LAURA: Okay.

04:21:50.727 --> 04:21:52.552
MATT: And that's where we'll call it for the
night.

04:21:52.552 --> 04:21:53.740
TRAVIS: Nice!

04:21:53.740 --> 04:21:55.753
MARISHA: That was awesome!

04:21:55.753 --> 04:21:59.984
TALIESIN: I'm at 57 hit points. Yay.

04:21:59.984 --> 04:22:02.534
TRAVIS: Add 100 to that and that's somewhere
Grog.

04:22:02.534 --> 04:22:06.279
TALIESIN: Where were you at? I feared for you,
man.

04:22:06.279 --> 04:22:07.424
ASHLEY: 11.

04:22:07.424 --> 04:22:08.595
LAURA: Oh my god!

04:22:08.595 --> 04:22:12.586
TRAVIS: That cherub was a bitch.

04:22:12.586 --> 04:22:18.130
MATT: Aw man. That was also created by the chat.

04:22:18.130 --> 04:22:19.439
TRAVIS: Was it?!

04:22:19.439 --> 04:22:22.030
LAURA: The baby was created by the chat?!

04:22:22.030 --> 04:22:23.658
TRAVIS: Why you do this to us, chat?

04:22:23.658 --> 04:22:27.016
TALIESIN: Why you make us kill a baby? That was
great.

04:22:27.016 --> 04:22:29.176
LAURA: That was a really cool villain.

04:22:29.232 --> 04:22:31.393
MATT: That was a tiny celestial.

04:22:31.393 --> 04:22:33.209
LIAM: Like beating up a Kewpie doll.

04:22:33.209 --> 04:22:39.478
MATT: Was the prospect of doing something that
attacks via the terrain instead of--

04:22:39.478 --> 04:22:41.125
ASHLEY: Was he an evil baby?

04:22:41.125 --> 04:22:43.555
LAURA: Yeah, was it evil? Or could we have saved
it?

04:22:43.555 --> 04:22:52.663
MATT: The actual title for it is Symphior the
Withered Planetar. It was essentially a celestial

04:22:52.663 --> 04:22:57.011
seed that was placed to eventually emerge as a
guardian in a future time, almost a Ragnarok-type

04:22:57.011 --> 04:23:04.304
circumstance. But the land around it became
corrupted as it gestated or was held in stasis,

04:23:04.304 --> 04:23:10.549
and then was awoken prematurely. And as such,
became this horrible monstrous version of what it

04:23:10.549 --> 04:23:25.504
was supposed to be. It was neutral, but it was
dangerous. It seemed pretty far gone. Thank you

04:23:25.504 --> 04:23:29.842
guys so much. We'll be back next week with the
battle royale. That'll be fun.

04:23:29.842 --> 04:23:31.276
TRAVIS: Everybody kill Keyleth.

04:23:31.276 --> 04:23:34.434
LAURA: Yeah. Go for Keyleth to begin with. Try to
kill her.

04:23:34.434 --> 04:23:37.477
MARISHA: I am going to be looking at &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; of my
spells.

04:23:37.477 --> 04:23:39.791
TALIESIN: These two have to be the first to go
down.

04:23:39.791 --> 04:23:42.356
MARISHA: What? Why?

04:23:42.356 --> 04:23:44.182
TALIESIN: Because loot drop.

04:23:44.182 --> 04:23:53.051
TRAVIS: Yeah, we've got to get Hunger Games with
this shit. Defend the cornucopia of loot!

04:23:53.100 --> 04:23:55.540
MARISHA: I'm going for the machete!

04:23:55.540 --> 04:23:57.888
SAM: But Vex, you're my best friend!

04:23:57.888 --> 04:24:00.338
LAURA: No, you're my best friend. I won't kill
you.

04:24:00.338 --> 04:24:04.491
SAM: Okay! Like, within five minutes.

04:24:04.491 --> 04:24:08.516
LIAM: This one shoved my face into lava at the end
of the last battle royale.

04:24:08.516 --> 04:24:11.281
MARISHA: I love you! (sizzling)

04:24:11.281 --> 04:24:13.523
MATT: It was pretty good.

04:24:13.523 --> 04:24:18.533
MARISHA: Then Pike did it to me immediately the
next round. I love you! (sizzling)

04:24:18.533 --> 04:24:22.683
MATT: Yeah, it was pretty slick. Exactly.

04:24:22.683 --> 04:24:24.316
MARISHA: Yes, it was.

04:24:24.316 --> 04:24:25.293
LAURA: Tight.

04:24:25.293 --> 04:24:27.868
MATT: Awesome. Thank you so much for
watching. We'll be back next week, Thursday, with

04:24:27.868 --> 04:24:34.109
our battle royale. Hope you have a wonderful night
and weekend. And is it Thursday yet? Good night!
