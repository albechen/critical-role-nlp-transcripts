00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.858
MATT: So first and foremost, we'll get our
announcements out of the way as fast as possible.

00:00:03.858 --> 00:00:11.342
First thing I want to announce, with a little help
from our resident gnome bard here today: Scanlan's

00:00:11.342 --> 00:00:15.136
playlist on Spotify went up on the website. Do you
want to talk a little bit about that?

00:00:15.136 --> 00:00:20.214
SAM: Go log on to GeekandSundry.com, slash "find
it on that site somewhere."

00:00:20.214 --> 00:00:22.796
MARISHA: It's on the front page right now.

00:00:22.796 --> 00:00:27.067
SAM: And you can find it on Spotify. There's some
cool songs on there.

00:00:27.067 --> 00:00:30.308
TRAVIS: That's baby-making music right there,
baby.

00:00:30.308 --> 00:00:34.827
SAM: Yeah. There's some panty peelers in there,
too.

00:00:34.827 --> 00:00:36.286
LAURA: Oh god.

00:00:36.286 --> 00:00:37.547
MATT: That's a terrible term.

00:00:37.547 --> 00:00:41.517
SAM: I wrote it in the song description. Somebody
edited it out.

00:00:41.517 --> 00:00:44.717
(laughter)

00:00:44.717 --> 00:00:46.177
MARISHA: Oh no.

00:00:46.177 --> 00:00:48.391
TALIESIN: Well.

00:00:48.391 --> 00:00:49.912
MATT: Go check that out, guys.

00:00:49.912 --> 00:00:52.419
LAURA: Go check that out, guys.

00:00:52.419 --> 00:00:55.586
MATT: Exactly. It's actually a pretty great
playlist; I've been listening to it all afternoon

00:00:55.586 --> 00:00:58.948
while prepping for this. By the way, it's really
interesting to write stuff for the current

00:00:58.948 --> 00:01:01.620
scenario in Whitestone with some Marvin Gaye in
the background.

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.417
TALIESIN: Are we going to feel that influence in
tonight's game?

00:01:05.417 --> 00:01:14.396
MATT: I certainly hope not. Also, next cool
announcement: our first Critical Role comic came

00:01:14.396 --> 00:01:24.921
out today. Our four glorious first panels starting
off the past adventure of the party in Westruun

00:01:24.921 --> 00:01:30.199
for their first Winter's Crest Festival. So yeah,
there will be one four-panel comic coming out each

00:01:30.199 --> 00:01:35.085
week to go through the six week run of this
storyline, written by our fantastic Taliesin Jaffe

00:01:35.085 --> 00:01:39.317
and Marisha Ray over here, and drawn by the
incredible--

00:01:39.317 --> 00:01:40.509
SAM: Sam Riegel.

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:45.601
MATT: No. (laughs) @WendyDoodles on Twitter. You
guys know her as Wendy. She's one of our official

00:01:45.601 --> 00:01:51.061
artists. She's absolutely amazing. She's our
artist for this run. So show her some love.

00:01:51.061 --> 00:01:52.358
LIAM: Endlessly charming.

00:01:52.358 --> 00:01:53.462
LAURA: Yes, she is.

00:01:53.462 --> 00:01:54.581
MATT: Very much so.

00:01:54.581 --> 00:01:58.651
ZAC: Really quick announcement that I forgot to
put on the document. Hey, guys. We are still in

00:01:58.651 --> 00:02:03.671
sub-only chat tonight, but we will be doing a
giveaway at the half if we reach the sub goal,

00:02:03.671 --> 00:02:09.308
which is every 100, and I think we're 93 away from
the next one. So if we hit 11,500 before the half,

00:02:09.308 --> 00:02:13.718
there will be a giveaway, and we will open that up
to everyone watching, not just subscribers only.

00:02:13.718 --> 00:02:16.528
So anyone watching, don't fret. You still have a
chance to win stuff.

00:02:16.528 --> 00:02:18.103
MATT: And what is in the giveaway?

00:02:18.103 --> 00:02:25.924
ZAC: Tons of shit. Signed posters, D&amp;amp;D stuff. It's
just a box of awesome shit.

00:02:25.924 --> 00:02:27.980
TALIESIN: www.TonsOfShit.com

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:29.620
MARISHA: Don't look that up.

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.160
TALIESIN: Don't look that up. It's just going to
make you unhappy.

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:37.087
LIAM: We got a big fat care package from Kurtis
Wiebe, who is the writer of Rat Queens, so we have

00:02:37.087 --> 00:02:42.953
collected volumes. I think the first volume or two
of Rat Queens. There's some t-shirts, so some of

00:02:42.953 --> 00:02:45.694
that will probably be finding its way in.
Obviously, we love Rat Queens.

00:02:45.694 --> 00:02:47.219
LAURA: Obviously.

00:02:47.219 --> 00:02:54.209
MATT: We like to fill your care packages with tons
of cool shit. We throw random things in there for

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:56.679
you guys, as well. Cool random things, not just
random things.

00:02:56.679 --> 00:02:58.315
MARISHA: It's like Critical Role's favorite
things.

00:02:58.315 --> 00:02:59.650
MATT and LAURA: Yeah.

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:01.141
TALIESIN: We'll be putting out a catalog.

00:03:01.141 --> 00:03:01.889
MARISHA: Yes.

00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:04.091
TALIESIN: Critical Role's most favorite things.

00:03:04.091 --> 00:03:06.593
MATT: Cool, so check out the comic strip.

00:03:06.593 --> 00:03:08.352
ZAC: There is a fucking broom behind you.

00:03:08.352 --> 00:03:10.512
MATT: There is a broom. Get that out of there.
There you go.

00:03:10.512 --> 00:03:12.991
TRAVIS: It's because we're going to sweep these
Briarwoods under the carpet!

00:03:12.991 --> 00:03:14.760
ALL: Whoa!

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:18.177
SAM: That was quick. Love that one.

00:03:18.177 --> 00:03:19.582
MARISHA: So good.

00:03:19.582 --> 00:03:20.790
MATT: Are you?

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:22.838
(laughter)

00:03:22.838 --> 00:03:25.731
TALIESIN: I've got another character ready to roll
when this all goes down.

00:03:25.731 --> 00:03:29.369
MARISHA: No! You can't have a plan B already.

00:03:29.369 --> 00:03:30.903
LAURA: I don't have a plan B.

00:03:30.903 --> 00:03:32.738
TALIESIN: Much like my parents, I have no plan B.

00:03:32.738 --> 00:03:38.263
MATT: Laura, if you want to take this away, we
have some new merch, apparently, that just went up

00:03:38.263 --> 00:03:39.251
in the store.

00:03:39.251 --> 00:03:46.066
LAURA: Oh my goodness gracious! So yeah, starting
today, there will be a couple of Critmas hoodies

00:03:46.066 --> 00:03:49.553
available in the Geek and Sundry store, so
Marisha, if you want to hold up one?

00:03:49.553 --> 00:03:50.578
MARISHA: Ready?

00:03:50.578 --> 00:03:55.268
LAURA: There's black and green. You guys should go
on the website and check it out, because all the

00:03:55.268 --> 00:03:57.349
little details are freaking amazing.

00:03:57.349 --> 00:03:58.959
TRAVIS: There's ugly Critmas sweaters.

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:00.772
LAURA: And these are designed by Kenneth.

00:04:00.772 --> 00:04:03.523
TALIESIN: Yule poop! There's yule poop here.

00:04:03.523 --> 00:04:08.162
SAM: Aw, there is, and it's singing!

00:04:08.162 --> 00:04:14.036
LAURA: There's a little Trinket and there's Minxie.
And there's a Pepperbox shooting bullets

00:04:14.036 --> 00:04:15.480
TALIESIN: And then there's arrows.

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:16.951
LAURA: And there's "dagger, dagger, dagger."

00:04:16.951 --> 00:04:18.636
MARISHA: It's a Critmas sweater.

00:04:18.636 --> 00:04:22.592
LIAM: I just tweeted out links to the store from
the @criticalrole twitter handle.

00:04:22.592 --> 00:04:28.393
LAURA: So they're the coolest, and then I know
everybody was talking about how the "How Do You

00:04:28.393 --> 00:04:32.855
Want to Do This?" shirts were sold out. Those will
be coming back very soon, and there is also "How

00:04:32.855 --> 00:04:36.492
Do You Want to Do This?" mouse pads for those
people that don't want to wear anything and just

00:04:36.492 --> 00:04:38.619
want to surf the web.

00:04:38.619 --> 00:04:40.915
TRAVIS: Watch us, au naturel.

00:04:40.915 --> 00:04:43.980
TALIESIN: I'm now wondering how much of our
audience is currently-- no, never mind.

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:45.205
SAM: Just wearing a mouse pad?

00:04:45.205 --> 00:04:46.716
(laughter)

00:04:46.716 --> 00:04:49.242
MATT: For those who don't know, I don't wear pants
during this show.

00:04:49.242 --> 00:04:51.220
LAURA: We're like newscasters.

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:53.619
MATT: Exactly.

00:04:53.619 --> 00:04:55.421
TALIESIN: He's so hairy, we hardly notice.

00:04:55.421 --> 00:04:57.042
MATT: It's true, I'm like a satyr.

00:04:57.042 --> 00:05:01.190
(laughter)

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:02.690
MARISHA: This is escalating quickly.

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:04.033
TALIESIN: I've got plastic on my character.

00:05:04.033 --> 00:05:05.990
TRAVIS: A satyr! Draw that shit first.

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:07.646
(laughter)

00:05:07.646 --> 00:05:13.257
MATT: No, damn it. Oh man. Yeah, we had a lot of
great feedback from people saying that shirts were

00:05:13.257 --> 00:05:16.738
great, but we want to expand into other parts of
merchandise people were requesting, so we're

00:05:16.738 --> 00:05:17.832
starting to do that.

00:05:17.832 --> 00:05:21.446
LAURA: Yeah, there's some other cool things coming
up, too, but that's what's available now.

00:05:21.446 --> 00:05:24.602
MATT: We've been trying to be creative to make
sure you guys have stuff if you want it,

00:05:24.602 --> 00:05:25.963
especially for this season.

00:05:25.963 --> 00:05:29.917
TALIESIN: Oh, and just to do it again since we
haven't done it enough, please do check out the

00:05:29.917 --> 00:05:36.157
Spotify links and the comics. Go to the actual
Geek and Sundry website because the more traffic

00:05:36.157 --> 00:05:42.461
the Geek and Sundry website gets for you guys
going there to look at our stuff, the more excited

00:05:42.461 --> 00:05:46.823
they are to do cool stuff for us, so if you want
more of this, definitely go there.

00:05:46.823 --> 00:05:50.817
LAURA: Well, also if you go to the website, then
you can see the blurbs that we wrote about each of

00:05:50.817 --> 00:05:53.355
the songs and the explanations about why we chose
them.

00:05:53.355 --> 00:05:54.808
MARISHA: We each picked fanart.

00:05:54.808 --> 00:06:00.123
SAM: What I do is I favorite the geekandsundry.com
website. I check it every morning when I wake up.

00:06:00.123 --> 00:06:02.431
That's what I do. It's my news in the morning.

00:06:02.431 --> 00:06:07.552
TRAVIS: I think I'll do that tomorrow morning.
That's a great idea. That's imitatable.

00:06:07.552 --> 00:06:10.981
TALIESIN: We have so much stuff we want to do for
you guys. We have grand plans.

00:06:10.981 --> 00:06:12.756
LAURA: Grand slam plans.

00:06:12.756 --> 00:06:14.040
TALIESIN: Thank you, ma'am.

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:15.301
MARISHA: Thanks, Denny's.

00:06:15.301 --> 00:06:20.979
MATT: All right, cool. Next up, just to remind you
guys, most of our actual show announcements and

00:06:20.979 --> 00:06:25.809
stuff go up on our @criticalrole twitter handle,
and we have all our personal ones, but that's our

00:06:25.809 --> 00:06:29.553
central place for all Critical Role-related
business and announcements, so if you don't

00:06:29.553 --> 00:06:36.205
already follow that, you should because all our
cool stuff goes up on that. Also, today's

00:06:36.205 --> 00:06:41.312
donations and our donations for a while are going
to be going towards a new charity, pushing towards

00:06:41.312 --> 00:06:46.915
Doctors Without Borders, to help support people in
crisis around the world. It's a wonderful

00:06:46.915 --> 00:06:51.016
organization. We're going to play a video with
information about it during the break today, but

00:06:51.016 --> 00:06:56.945
in a world that is filled with a lot of
positivity, there are dark places and there are

00:06:56.945 --> 00:07:02.441
dark things and people need aid, so we're hoping
to do what we can to try and give to those

00:07:02.441 --> 00:07:06.747
circumstances, so check it out at the break and if
anyone who is able to help give to that,

00:07:06.747 --> 00:07:08.078
please do so.

00:07:08.078 --> 00:07:09.364
TRAVIS: Solid.

00:07:09.364 --> 00:07:13.923
MATT: Let's see, a couple other announcements. We
will be off next week for Thanksgiving because all

00:07:13.923 --> 00:07:18.684
of us have families to see, so there will be no
Critical Role next week, unfortunately. I think

00:07:18.684 --> 00:07:22.129
we'll be doing-- are we doing a rebroadcast of
something?

00:07:22.129 --> 00:07:25.099
ZAC: We'll probably do a rebroadcast of all the
episodes.

00:07:25.099 --> 00:07:25.994
MATT: Okay.

00:07:25.994 --> 00:07:27.133
LAURA: Like a marathon?

00:07:27.133 --> 00:07:28.008
ZAC: Sure, why not.

00:07:28.008 --> 00:07:34.349
MATT: Or just 24 hours of a close-up of a turkey.
A turkey I cooked, so undercooked. But yeah, so we

00:07:34.349 --> 00:07:38.081
won't be here next Thursday, but we'll be thinking
of you lovingly in the process, and we'll be

00:07:38.081 --> 00:07:40.875
returning the Thursday after that to continue the
story.

00:07:40.875 --> 00:07:43.410
TALIESIN: You'll be DMing a game for your family,
I would assume.

00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:46.778
(laughter)

00:07:46.778 --> 00:07:54.311
MATT: No, it never ends. No, I'll be eating
copious amounts of pumpkin pie, probably.

00:07:54.311 --> 00:07:57.574
LIAM: You are now Homer Simpson in hell with
donuts just going in.

00:07:57.574 --> 00:07:59.372
(laughter)

00:07:59.372 --> 00:08:09.122
MATT: More, more! Yeah, so there's that. Other
cool announcement, this week saw a video game

00:08:09.122 --> 00:08:11.279
release of Star Wars: Battlefront.

00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:12.475
TRAVIS: It's so good.

00:08:12.475 --> 00:08:14.598
MATT: I haven't had a chance to play it yet,
because Fallout.

00:08:14.598 --> 00:08:16.531
LAURA and MARISHA: Because Fallout.

00:08:16.531 --> 00:08:22.164
MATT: But that's next on the list. But you can
hear both me and Marisha in Star Wars: Battlefront

00:08:22.164 --> 00:08:23.478
as stormtroopers.

00:08:23.478 --> 00:08:25.045
(cheering)

00:08:25.045 --> 00:08:28.793
MATT: Both to kill you if you're rebels or to do
better if you're with the Empire.

00:08:28.793 --> 00:08:34.675
MARISHA: This is the first time they're really
focusing on female stormtroopers,

00:08:34.675 --> 00:08:37.302
so it's pretty cool.

00:08:37.302 --> 00:08:40.400
MATT: I think it's rad. So apologies for being
yelled at by us.

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:42.844
Anything else you want to go over?

00:08:42.844 --> 00:08:47.403
TRAVIS: Yeah. Sam. Put your hand up by your face.
Now high five me while I high five down on the

00:08:47.403 --> 00:08:48.534
count of three. One.

00:08:48.534 --> 00:08:49.693
SAM: Wait, do I go up or down?

00:08:49.693 --> 00:08:54.000
TRAVIS: You're going straight down, straight up.
One, two, three (impact noise). Did it work?

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.015
SAM: Did it work?

00:08:55.015 --> 00:08:57.603
TRAVIS: I've got to go lower. One, two, three
(impact noise).

00:08:57.603 --> 00:08:59.015
SAM: Ah! So strong!

00:08:59.015 --> 00:09:01.640
(laughter)

00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:04.209
LAURA: I want to see if it works.

00:09:04.209 --> 00:09:05.667
TRAVIS: You've got to wait 20 seconds.

00:09:05.667 --> 00:09:08.021
(laughter)

00:09:08.021 --> 00:09:17.500
LIAM: Switched over to PayPal. While he looks at
that, one last thing. We are, as always, friends

00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:24.642
with Wyrmwood Gaming. If you want beautiful wooden
boxes in all kinds of colors and patterns, go to

00:09:24.642 --> 00:09:29.983
Wyrmwood Gaming, and if you use the code CritRole,
you will get free shipping.

00:09:29.983 --> 00:09:31.355
LAURA: Say it again. CritRole.

00:09:31.355 --> 00:09:34.300
LIAM: You'll get free shipping. Hey, one nerd
helping out another.

00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:36.381
TRAVIS: They are so sexy.

00:09:36.381 --> 00:09:40.998
LAURA: They are very sexy. And they have magnets
in them to keep your dice protected when they're

00:09:40.998 --> 00:09:43.116
in your other bags. Your Bag of Holding.

00:09:43.116 --> 00:09:46.107
MARISHA: Christmas is just around the corner.

00:09:46.107 --> 00:09:50.111
MATT: It keeps my Critmas bronze? Thank you.

00:09:50.111 --> 00:09:53.204
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, you've got your little mini.

00:09:53.204 --> 00:09:57.343
MATT: I know I'm so excited I have a mini! I'm not
even in the game, really, but I am.

00:09:57.343 --> 00:10:02.145
LAURA: That's Gilmore's mini. Any time Gilmore
talks, can he have that mini?

00:10:02.145 --> 00:10:06.864
MATT: No. I'm going to one day do a Gilmore mini
in private. It'll be fun. All right.

00:10:06.864 --> 00:10:09.462
LIAM: I brought this for good luck today.

00:10:09.462 --> 00:10:12.354
(laughter)

00:10:12.354 --> 00:10:14.481
LIAM: It's going to be my woobie.

00:10:14.481 --> 00:10:22.959
TALIESIN: Hey, now. Not cool. Not cool. We do not
use the W word around here.

00:10:22.959 --> 00:10:24.594
SAM: Does he even know what he's saying?

00:10:24.594 --> 00:10:26.146
TALIESIN: Yeah, he knows.

00:10:26.146 --> 00:10:27.731
LIAM: We're off the rails again.

00:10:27.731 --> 00:10:28.887
SAM: All right, let's go.

00:10:28.887 --> 00:10:29.730
TALIESIN: Sorry.

00:10:29.730 --> 00:10:31.257
MARISHA: Fucking vampires.

00:10:31.257 --> 00:10:32.656
MATT: Did you use woobie intentionally?

00:10:32.656 --> 00:10:33.601
LIAM: Yes.

00:10:33.601 --> 00:10:34.748
TALIESIN: Goddamn it.

00:10:34.748 --> 00:10:36.874
LIAM: He's in Mr. Mom!

00:10:36.874 --> 00:10:40.053
TALIESIN: They don't know where you're pointing.

00:10:40.053 --> 00:10:42.028
LAURA: Point down!

00:10:42.028 --> 00:10:48.441
LIAM: He's in Mr. Mom. This guy right here.

00:10:48.441 --> 00:11:00.515
MATT: Anyway! Let's get kicking into this
evening's episode of Critical Role. So. To get all

00:11:00.515 --> 00:11:08.955
of you up to speed. The party has traveled to
Whitestone, partially to free their name of some

00:11:08.955 --> 00:11:14.746
negative political ramifications back in their
home city of Emon, and to aid Percy in possibly

00:11:14.746 --> 00:11:20.278
freeing his hometown of Whitestone from the
oppression of Lord and Lady Briarwood, a couple

00:11:20.278 --> 00:11:27.060
who have risen to power over the past five years
after slaughtering his family and taking it over

00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:28.712
and keeping it all this time.

00:11:28.712 --> 00:11:36.705
After arriving, they found a very heavy undead
presence in the town, with giant zombies roaming

00:11:36.705 --> 00:11:44.649
the streets as sentinels. Most of the townsfolk
kept under perpetual watch in this slowly

00:11:44.649 --> 00:11:51.033
will-crushing atmosphere. But as Vox Machina
arrived, they began to instill the thoughts of

00:11:51.033 --> 00:11:57.675
rebellion. Stoking those flames once again with
the return of the surviving de Rolo, they began to

00:11:57.675 --> 00:12:00.516
sway the people's minds to make a final stand.

00:12:00.516 --> 00:12:06.198
During that time, they also discovered that
Percy's sister Cassandra is also a surviving de

00:12:06.198 --> 00:12:12.614
Rolo and exists somewhere in Castle Whitestone,
seemingly under lock and key. The party began to

00:12:12.614 --> 00:12:17.934
systematically take out members of the new nobles
who worked underneath the Briarwoods, setting many

00:12:17.934 --> 00:12:23.770
buildings on fire, leaving emblems of the de Rolo
crest across the town and written in the sky, and

00:12:23.770 --> 00:12:30.093
after an extensive battle, began to make their way
toward Castle Whitestone itself. Burrowing into a

00:12:30.093 --> 00:12:37.347
partially collapsed but long-remembered secret
passage underneath the castle, the party rested

00:12:37.347 --> 00:12:44.313
for the evening with the help of their recently
arrived cleric Pike, who had managed to project

00:12:44.313 --> 00:12:49.653
herself through the will of Sarenrae as a
spiritual body given temporary physical form.

00:12:49.653 --> 00:12:55.610
While they were searching this tunnel, it led to
the dungeons, the prison cells beneath the Castle

00:12:55.610 --> 00:13:00.982
Whitestone where Percy once woke up five years
before, before Cassandra helped him escape. While

00:13:00.982 --> 00:13:07.369
they were walking through those cells, they
discovered an old woman currently locked down

00:13:07.369 --> 00:13:15.260
below there who is asking for the party's aid in
freeing her from her imprisonment. And last time

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:19.205
we left off, you were helping with--

00:13:19.205 --> 00:13:20.352
LAURA: Fake helping.

00:13:20.352 --> 00:13:22.816
MATT: Fake helping with the lock, much to her
chagrin.

00:13:22.816 --> 00:13:26.039
LAURA: Yeah, and I had just snapped it off into
the locks so that it's jammed it.

00:13:26.039 --> 00:13:32.140
MATT: Yeah, you're a terrible person. All right,
so as you snap off the lock and pull away from it,

00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:39.104
having the strange physical interaction in the
darkness around here, Trinket behind you just

00:13:39.104 --> 00:13:44.146
breathing over your shoulder, keeping close to you
just in case anything's wrong. She pulls her hands

00:13:44.146 --> 00:13:50.898
away. "Fine. (huff) Do as you wish, leave me to
rot."

00:13:50.898 --> 00:13:53.357
LAURA: Oh, we'll be back. Don't worry.

00:13:53.357 --> 00:14:00.410
MATT: She backs up and sits in the far corner of
the prison cell and (huffs).

00:14:00.410 --> 00:14:03.821
LAURA: I look around. Has everyone left me?

00:14:03.821 --> 00:14:05.917
TRAVIS: The only people that are in the light--

00:14:05.917 --> 00:14:09.498
LAURA: All right then I follow to where everybody
else is going.

00:14:09.498 --> 00:14:11.771
MATT: All right.

00:14:11.771 --> 00:14:15.036
TRAVIS: She only saw me and--

00:14:15.036 --> 00:14:17.348
LAURA: Me and Scanlan.

00:14:17.348 --> 00:14:20.615
MATT: And Scanlan, yeah. You all stepped out into
the light. The rest of you stayed in the shadows.

00:14:20.615 --> 00:14:23.484
LAURA: Okay.

00:14:23.484 --> 00:14:31.357
MATT: All right, so there are the rest of the
cells which Vax has gone through and taken some

00:14:31.357 --> 00:14:35.709
time to inspect, where you found what appear to be
the remnants of individuals who were imprisoned

00:14:35.709 --> 00:14:40.544
here and then left to die, long rotted, their
corpses picked apart by various resident rodents

00:14:40.544 --> 00:14:48.488
and other creatures. After doing your passes, the
conversation has happened, you see no other signs

00:14:48.488 --> 00:14:54.442
of life down here. This being the sole prisoner
currently within the cells below.

00:14:54.442 --> 00:14:57.318
LAURA: I go and I find Scanlan.

00:14:57.318 --> 00:14:58.889
SAM: Oi.

00:14:58.889 --> 00:15:01.053
LAURA: So, question.

00:15:01.053 --> 00:15:02.246
SAM: Yes?

00:15:02.246 --> 00:15:17.538
LAURA: When you cast Seeming on us, our visual--
if you made me look like a cow, would I seem like

00:15:17.581 --> 00:15:20.587
a cow when I bumped into you, or would I seem like
a human?

00:15:20.587 --> 00:15:22.536
SAM: Are you asking me to make you into a cow
right now?

00:15:22.536 --> 00:15:24.358
LAURA: No, I'm saying that if something was
different--

00:15:24.358 --> 00:15:26.042
SAM: Because I think this is not the right time.

00:15:26.042 --> 00:15:28.344
LAURA: I think that old woman was doing something
weird.

00:15:28.344 --> 00:15:29.494
SAM: Why do you think that?

00:15:29.494 --> 00:15:32.769
LAURA: Because she looked like she had full
handses, but--

00:15:32.769 --> 00:15:34.018
SAM: Four hands?

00:15:34.018 --> 00:15:35.556
LAURA: Full.

00:15:35.601 --> 00:15:37.327
SAM: Oh, full hands. Okay.

00:15:37.327 --> 00:15:39.684
LAURA: Normal sort of hands, but I didn't feel
them.

00:15:39.684 --> 00:15:44.083
SAM: You didn't feel them? You touched her hand
and it just passed right through?

00:15:44.083 --> 00:15:45.460
LAURA: Her hand touched me, but it didn't--

00:15:45.460 --> 00:15:47.344
SAM: That's an illusion of some sort, yeah.

00:15:47.344 --> 00:15:48.637
LAURA: So she was doing some sort of--

00:15:48.637 --> 00:15:54.064
SAM: I don't know what, but yes. If I were to cast
Seeming on us, or some other sort of magic, it

00:15:54.064 --> 00:15:57.475
would make us look one way but not feel that way.

00:15:57.475 --> 00:15:59.335
LAURA: I guess it's good that we left her, then.

00:15:59.335 --> 00:16:02.754
SAM: She's a caster of some sort?

00:16:02.754 --> 00:16:03.783
LAURA: I don't know.

00:16:03.783 --> 00:16:05.423
TRAVIS: Can you dispel Seeming?

00:16:05.423 --> 00:16:07.819
SAM: Should we go find out?

00:16:07.819 --> 00:16:10.139
LAURA: I don't know.

00:16:10.139 --> 00:16:11.447
TRAVIS: How would we do that?

00:16:11.447 --> 00:16:13.381
LAURA: Can you dispel Seeming?

00:16:13.381 --> 00:16:16.913
SAM: I don't know. (laughing) Let's go find out.

00:16:16.913 --> 00:16:19.677
MARISHA: Do you have a Dispel Magic on you right
now?

00:16:19.677 --> 00:16:20.897
SAM: I have-- No.

00:16:20.897 --> 00:16:22.456
MARISHA: Oh my god, I do!

00:16:22.456 --> 00:16:23.247
SAM: Well.

00:16:23.247 --> 00:16:24.368
MARISHA: I learned it.

00:16:24.368 --> 00:16:25.409
SAM: Oh, Keyleth?

00:16:25.409 --> 00:16:28.759
TALIESIN: Are we calling everyone over for this
conversation?

00:16:28.759 --> 00:16:31.179
SAM: I think we should.

00:16:31.179 --> 00:16:32.548
TRAVIS: Away from her.

00:16:32.548 --> 00:16:33.929
LAURA: Yeah, I'm far away from her now.

00:16:33.929 --> 00:16:36.911
SAM: That prisoner over there is casting magic of
some sort.

00:16:36.911 --> 00:16:41.258
LAURA: I think she had Seeming cast on her. I
don't know if she did it herself or if-- well, I

00:16:41.258 --> 00:16:42.807
don't think she was what she appeared to be.

00:16:42.807 --> 00:16:44.859
TALIESIN: Do we want to waste power on somebody
who's...

00:16:44.859 --> 00:16:45.942
SAM: What if she's--

00:16:45.942 --> 00:16:47.061
TRAVIS: An early warning system?

00:16:47.061 --> 00:16:48.486
SAM: Yeah, what if she's a guard?

00:16:48.486 --> 00:16:53.113
MARISHA: What if she's Lady Briarwood? Like what
we were saying? That's what I'm most afraid of.

00:16:53.113 --> 00:16:56.722
SAM: Well, then we should find out now and kill
the shit out of her.

00:16:56.722 --> 00:16:58.749
TRAVIS: I vote for that.

00:16:58.749 --> 00:17:05.109
MARISHA: Well, before we do that, let's see who
she is. I did come prepared, though,

00:17:05.109 --> 00:17:06.842
to dispel magic.

00:17:06.842 --> 00:17:09.077
LAURA: So you can do Dispel Magic?

00:17:09.077 --> 00:17:10.508
MARISHA: I learned it. I did.

00:17:10.508 --> 00:17:12.315
LAURA: Stay in the shadows, Keyleth, and cast it
on her.

00:17:12.315 --> 00:17:15.362
TRAVIS: Percy, you're wearing what?

00:17:15.362 --> 00:17:20.252
TALIESIN: I'm wearing a hat of disguise so that
I'm not immediately identifiable.

00:17:20.252 --> 00:17:22.089
TRAVIS: What are you in disguise as?

00:17:22.089 --> 00:17:23.683
LAURA: A dude in a hat.

00:17:23.683 --> 00:17:28.471
TALIESIN: Link from the Legend of Zelda. I don't
know.

00:17:28.471 --> 00:17:30.599
SAM: Well, you've got to figure it out right now.

00:17:30.599 --> 00:17:35.641
TALIESIN: I'm going to figure it out right now.
Just as a reasonable Whitestone peasant.

00:17:35.641 --> 00:17:36.746
MATT: Okay.

00:17:36.746 --> 00:17:39.299
LIAM: Terrible teeth.

00:17:39.299 --> 00:17:40.688
TALIESIN: Trying to blend in.

00:17:40.688 --> 00:17:45.511
MATT: By comparison to this troop, you're some
poor sap who got pulled along, but yeah. You are

00:17:45.511 --> 00:17:52.046
that one quest-giver in Warcraft that walks way
too slow and the party is like, "Come on, move!"

00:17:52.046 --> 00:17:53.912
That's who you look like right now.

00:17:53.912 --> 00:17:59.957
TRAVIS: Before we dispel magic on her, should we
have someone put her in their sights in case she

00:17:59.957 --> 00:18:01.449
gets a little funky monkey?

00:18:01.449 --> 00:18:02.916
MARISHA: She will be able to feel it.

00:18:02.916 --> 00:18:05.493
LAURA: Well, yeah. She'll look like she's not
herself.

00:18:05.493 --> 00:18:09.120
TALIESIN: We could also just ask her to drop it.

00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:14.996
TRAVIS: We asked her who she was. She lied. A
lot.

00:18:14.996 --> 00:18:17.133
TALIESIN: Well, we could ask her to drop the
Seeming.

00:18:17.133 --> 00:18:18.627
MARISHA: She lied pretty well, too.

00:18:18.627 --> 00:18:19.952
TALIESIN: She did.

00:18:19.952 --> 00:18:25.393
SAM: I could go talk to her, and meanwhile she
could be fiddling with her magic behind me.

00:18:25.393 --> 00:18:26.571
LAURA: Do it.

00:18:26.571 --> 00:18:28.279
MARISHA: You go talk to her. I'll be prepared.

00:18:28.279 --> 00:18:29.926
LAURA: I'll stay in the shadows with my arrow
notched.

00:18:29.926 --> 00:18:32.389
TRAVIS: I'll stay with Scanlan in case things go
wrong.

00:18:32.389 --> 00:18:37.764
MARISHA: I stay next to Vex.

00:18:37.764 --> 00:18:39.055
TALIESIN: I stay in the shadows.

00:18:39.055 --> 00:18:40.936
LIAM: How close together are the bars to this
cell?

00:18:40.936 --> 00:18:43.663
MATT: The bars are about four inches apart.

00:18:43.663 --> 00:18:44.553
LIAM: Four inches.

00:18:44.553 --> 00:18:46.470
LAURA: So my arrow will do much better than your
dagger.

00:18:46.470 --> 00:18:50.844
LIAM: Well, no. I'm not saying for you not to, but
would I be able to comfortably throw through?

00:18:50.881 --> 00:18:52.364
MATT: Yeah!

00:18:52.364 --> 00:18:55.116
LIAM: Yeah? All right. I'm not telling you not
to.

00:18:55.116 --> 00:18:56.416
LAURA: No, it's fine.

00:18:56.416 --> 00:18:58.179
MATT: She'd have a little bit of cover.

00:18:58.179 --> 00:19:01.185
LAURA: Shoot your arrow, too. Shoot your dagger.
Whatever.

00:19:01.185 --> 00:19:02.484
MARISHA: Shoot your dagger?

00:19:02.484 --> 00:19:03.695
SAM: He doesn't shoot daggers

00:19:03.695 --> 00:19:06.426
LIAM: Passive-aggressive much?

00:19:06.426 --> 00:19:08.574
SAM: All right, so I stroll over back to the
cell.

00:19:08.574 --> 00:19:10.159
TRAVIS: With Scanlan, also.

00:19:10.159 --> 00:19:12.538
SAM: Oh, flanked by Grog. Yes.

00:19:12.538 --> 00:19:14.036
MATT: Okay.

00:19:14.036 --> 00:19:16.298
TRAVIS: Not looking friendly, neither.

00:19:16.298 --> 00:19:20.570
MATT: Okay, and there is the one torch that's a
little off to the side that gives a little bit of

00:19:20.570 --> 00:19:25.180
light into this one portion of the dungeon below
here. She's sat out, into the shadows of the far

00:19:25.180 --> 00:19:31.372
corner, arms crossed. You can see a little bit of
the light framing her form. You make out okay in

00:19:31.372 --> 00:19:36.964
the darkness this close as a gnome, but you can
see that she's just hunched in the corner, huffing

00:19:36.964 --> 00:19:38.857
in frustration.

00:19:38.857 --> 00:19:45.883
SAM: Oi. Old lady. Listen. We said we were going
to come back for you and release you when all was

00:19:45.883 --> 00:19:52.413
said and done, but we cannot make that promise if
you don't tell us the complete truth. Now, we know

00:19:52.413 --> 00:19:55.989
that you're using magic of some sort. Tell us who
you really are.

00:19:55.989 --> 00:19:58.989
MATT: "I'm sorry, what?"

00:19:58.989 --> 00:20:03.610
SAM: We are smart little people. And big people.

00:20:03.610 --> 00:20:04.723
TRAVIS: Thank you.

00:20:04.723 --> 00:20:10.739
SAM: And we can sense that you are casting magic
of some sort on yourself to disguise yourself.

00:20:10.739 --> 00:20:17.640
Now, I have some familiarity with this, so I make
no judgment as to why, but please reveal your

00:20:17.702 --> 00:20:23.390
true self to us or else we cannot trust you and we
will leave you here to rot and possibly die.

00:20:23.390 --> 00:20:26.077
TRAVIS: (whispered) Now.

00:20:26.077 --> 00:20:31.601
MARISHA: Now! I do it now!

00:20:31.601 --> 00:20:34.664
(laughter)

00:20:34.664 --> 00:20:36.570
SAM: "Now, I do it now?"

00:20:36.570 --> 00:20:40.161
TRAVIS: Hopefully quieter than that.

00:20:40.161 --> 00:20:48.130
MATT: As Keyleth, partially in the shadows-- the
form of Scanlan small enough to not really obscure

00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:56.640
her presence-- but she nevertheless gestures in
the air, recites beneath her words the forbidden

00:20:56.640 --> 00:21:04.908
druidic languages that coalesce the powers of
nature around. At which point, there's a dull

00:21:04.908 --> 00:21:12.631
flash of energy within the cell. Some of the
nearby straw on the ground gets blown away from

00:21:12.631 --> 00:21:16.673
her form from the general push of air the spell
disperses and the impact.

00:21:16.673 --> 00:21:19.269
MARISHA: Sorry, got a little squirrely on that
one.

00:21:19.269 --> 00:21:29.443
MATT: The grey hair, the tattered clothes all
vanish, revealing beneath it a woman in her early

00:21:29.443 --> 00:21:36.104
mid-forties or so. Jet black hair pulled into a
tight ponytail, but strings of it in front of her

00:21:36.104 --> 00:21:41.645
face. Still in disarray but nowhere near as
wrecked as the previous visage you were presented

00:21:41.645 --> 00:21:51.480
with. She's wearing nice travel clothes with what
looks like some sort of a long duster-like coat

00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:57.722
that is a little ragged. You can see there's a
little stain from being down here for a while. As

00:21:57.722 --> 00:22:01.949
soon as this moment hits, she pushes back even
further, pressing herself against the wall, arms

00:22:01.949 --> 00:22:03.288
to the side.

00:22:03.288 --> 00:22:05.238
TRAVIS: There you are.

00:22:05.238 --> 00:22:09.415
SAM: I must say, you look way better like this.

00:22:09.415 --> 00:22:13.558
MATT: "Happy?"

00:22:13.558 --> 00:22:15.399
SAM: Extremely.

00:22:15.399 --> 00:22:16.648
TRAVIS: Yes, I'd say so.

00:22:16.648 --> 00:22:19.267
SAM: Yes, so who are you for real?

00:22:19.267 --> 00:22:30.379
MATT: "My name is Anna, and I would like to be set
free, if you don't mind. I can be of assistance to

00:22:30.379 --> 00:22:34.619
"you. I happen to know a lot of information about
the people that currently

00:22:34.619 --> 00:22:36.615
"reside within this castle."

00:22:36.615 --> 00:22:38.645
SAM: How would you know anything about them?

00:22:38.645 --> 00:22:42.511
MATT: "Release me and I'll tell you."

00:22:42.511 --> 00:22:44.408
TRAVIS: You want to be set free?

00:22:44.408 --> 00:22:46.648
LAURA: Tell us and we'll release you.

00:22:46.648 --> 00:22:52.511
MATT: "You've been so forthright in your interest
in helping such an old and frail woman. How can I

00:22:52.511 --> 00:22:55.957
"have any sort of guarantee of my safety should I
give you the information you seek? You could very

00:22:55.957 --> 00:22:57.850
"well slay me in this cell."

00:22:57.850 --> 00:22:59.771
TRAVIS: That might happen if you're not careful.

00:22:59.771 --> 00:23:02.270
MARISHA: What's Percy doing right now? Where's
Percy?

00:23:02.270 --> 00:23:04.872
LAURA: Do you recognize her, Percy?

00:23:04.872 --> 00:23:07.065
TALIESIN: Yes.

00:23:07.065 --> 00:23:16.748
MATT: You very much recognize her. You do notice,
by the way, her right hand? The sleeve ends. There

00:23:16.748 --> 00:23:21.205
is no hand there. It is just a missing hand, and
the left hand is visible.

00:23:21.205 --> 00:23:25.808
TRAVIS: As far as we can see, unarmed? Right?

00:23:25.808 --> 00:23:26.962
MATT: Yeah.

00:23:26.962 --> 00:23:28.052
TALIESIN: Anna?

00:23:28.052 --> 00:23:30.160
MATT: "Yes?"

00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:38.030
TALIESIN: Let's be frank with each other. You have
two options: either you are going to die in this

00:23:38.030 --> 00:23:45.401
cell-- and I promise you, you will die in this cell--
or you are going to convince us why you shouldn't.

00:23:45.469 --> 00:23:53.664
So I would start talking right now or I swear we
will not leave this dungeon before you're dead.

00:23:53.664 --> 00:24:01.574
MATT: Roll an intimidation check.

00:24:01.574 --> 00:24:04.705
MARISHA: It's pretty good.

00:24:04.705 --> 00:24:06.351
TALIESIN: 16.

00:24:06.351 --> 00:24:08.543
MATT: 16, okay.

00:24:08.543 --> 00:24:14.114
LIAM: And just as he finishes talking, I throw a
dagger a foot away from her head in the wall.

00:24:14.114 --> 00:24:15.051
MATT: Okay.

00:24:15.051 --> 00:24:17.951
LAURA: You gave her a fucking dagger? And then it
flashes back to you, right?

00:24:17.951 --> 00:24:19.989
(laughter)

00:24:19.989 --> 00:24:26.422
MATT: So the dagger which is thrown (whoosh) hits
the stone wall next to her and jams itself between

00:24:26.422 --> 00:24:32.297
two of the stone bricks and gets wedged there for
a second. She looks over for a second, reaches up

00:24:32.297 --> 00:24:35.652
for it and grabs the hilt as it vanishes in a puff
of smoke.

00:24:35.652 --> 00:24:37.365
LAURA: You are so fucking lucky it did that.

00:24:37.365 --> 00:24:43.335
(laughter)

00:24:43.335 --> 00:24:48.272
MATT: She leans forward and stands up and steps
into the light, and you have a better look of her

00:24:48.272 --> 00:24:53.699
now, and her face is a little weathered from
travel. You can see she definitely doesn't appear

00:24:53.699 --> 00:25:05.835
to be nobleborn, at least. She's by no means a
homely looking individual, but you can see she's

00:25:05.835 --> 00:25:10.764
seen the world, or elements of it, to have those
dark lines at the sides of her face, whether it be

00:25:10.807 --> 00:25:17.684
from smiles or frowning. She steps into the light
and looks to you, this peasant individual making

00:25:17.684 --> 00:25:24.395
these threats, and seems partially shaken but
keeping her composure in the face of such threats.

00:25:24.395 --> 00:25:33.014
She says, "Well, for one thing, I've been here
with them for the past five years. I helped them

00:25:33.014 --> 00:25:39.233
"reestablish their current social control of this
city when they left it a pile of flames and

00:25:39.233 --> 00:25:44.703
"rubble. And their little experiment beneath the
castle?

00:25:44.703 --> 00:25:48.604
"I was one of their chief scientific designers."

00:25:48.604 --> 00:25:52.815
TALIESIN: Tell us about the experiments beneath
the castle.

00:25:52.815 --> 00:25:56.702
MATT: (chuckles) "You'll have to ask Sylas or
Delilah for that. I don't have all the details or

00:25:56.702 --> 00:25:59.976
"the reasons behind it, other than the process I
was brought in to construct."

00:25:59.976 --> 00:26:01.799
MARISHA: Can I see if she's lying?

00:26:01.799 --> 00:26:05.075
MATT: You can. Make an insight check.

00:26:05.075 --> 00:26:06.895
MARISHA: Not great.

00:26:06.895 --> 00:26:08.544
TALIESIN: That's a number.

00:26:08.544 --> 00:26:10.558
MARISHA: It is a number. 16.

00:26:10.558 --> 00:26:20.381
MATT: 16? Okay. You get the sense that she's
telling the truth. You're not quite sure how far

00:26:20.381 --> 00:26:26.802
off the truth, but there doesn't seem to be any
sort of bald-faced deception in her voice, at this

00:26:26.802 --> 00:26:31.359
point. She speaks with a confidence and a
brusqueness of a person who is frustrated by the

00:26:31.359 --> 00:26:39.149
circumstance and has no other choice. "I wasn't
interested in their zealotry or the whispered

00:26:39.149 --> 00:26:44.195
"dealings, just the challenge behind the
construction. I enjoy challenge. Challenge that

00:26:44.195 --> 00:26:47.863
"pays, well, (chuckles) I enjoy that even more."

00:26:47.863 --> 00:26:54.997
TALIESIN: Question two: What are you doing down
here, really?

00:26:54.997 --> 00:27:02.106
MATT: "I'm down here because my work is done and I
wish not to linger with an impending battle. I

00:27:02.106 --> 00:27:07.348
"don't choose sides; I merely let them fight while
I live another day far, far away. I wouldn't have

00:27:07.348 --> 00:27:12.430
"gotten this far dealing with the people I've dealt
with in the past if I had chosen to stick around

00:27:12.430 --> 00:27:19.542
"under such circumstances, so I tried to leave. It
appears Anders saw me packing and decided to gain

00:27:19.542 --> 00:27:25.120
'a little favor by turning me in, so they threw me
down here, told me to wait out the rest of the

00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:32.281
"experiment, at least until the ziggurat was
complete. So here I am, living amongst rats in a

00:27:32.281 --> 00:27:35.016
"cell for over a week. That's my reward."

00:27:35.016 --> 00:27:37.391
LAURA: How did you lose the hand?

00:27:37.391 --> 00:27:44.017
MATT: "Experiments can be dangerous, sometimes. I
dabble with chemicals and alchemical reagents that

00:27:44.017 --> 00:27:53.281
"can be miscalculated, and I paid a price that will
be an ever-present reminder until I can find a way

00:27:53.281 --> 00:27:56.185
"to fix it. And there are ways."

00:27:56.185 --> 00:28:00.067
TRAVIS: Are you looking for ways to get back at
the Briarwoods?

00:28:00.067 --> 00:28:07.166
MATT: "Based on the way they've treated me here
and their possible intent to not even keep up

00:28:07.166 --> 00:28:11.312
"their end of the bargain now that I'm free to walk
away? Perhaps."

00:28:11.312 --> 00:28:15.161
TALIESIN: Can you lead us to Cassandra de Rolo?

00:28:15.161 --> 00:28:25.692
MATT: She turns her head with a curious look. "I
could, yes. Why do you ask?" She looks at you very

00:28:25.692 --> 00:28:26.698
intently.

00:28:26.698 --> 00:28:30.856
TALIESIN: That may be what your life is worth.

00:28:30.856 --> 00:28:44.175
MATT: "So. What else do you wish to know? What
else do you need, even, to get me out from behind

00:28:44.175 --> 00:28:48.611
"these bars? Because I'm growing very uncomfortable
and cold here in this cellar."

00:28:48.611 --> 00:29:00.297
TALIESIN: I pull forward, I look her very deeply
in the eye, and I say, you should know who your

00:29:00.297 --> 00:29:08.169
friends are here. Do you know that we're friends?
And I'm going to become friends.

00:29:08.169 --> 00:29:12.531
I'm casting Friends.

00:29:12.531 --> 00:29:13.838
MATT: Okay.

00:29:13.838 --> 00:29:17.571
TRAVIS and LAURA: What?

00:29:17.571 --> 00:29:23.113
TRAVIS: Is good Percy casting Friends or shadow
monster casting Friends?

00:29:23.113 --> 00:29:28.642
SAM: We'll never know until he and Ripley kill us
all.

00:29:28.642 --> 00:29:31.918
TALIESIN: I'm getting creepy. Just for flavor.
There is definitely some creepy happening.

00:29:31.918 --> 00:29:37.477
MATT: Okay. You stare at her at this point, intent
pushing yourself toward the bars, and she's still

00:29:37.477 --> 00:29:42.093
looking you over like she's searching for some
sort of an inclination as to why you're so

00:29:42.093 --> 00:29:44.075
interested in these particular questions.

00:29:44.075 --> 00:29:51.870
TALIESIN: You've been truthful with us so far,
correct? You haven't been fudging around or

00:29:51.870 --> 00:29:54.214
playing games with us, really, have you?

00:29:54.214 --> 00:29:57.285
MATT: "I've no reason to lie. Worst comes to
worst, you kill me where I stand or leave me here

00:29:57.285 --> 00:30:01.428
"to rot. What do I have to gain by lying at this
point? Besides, you've already proven you can see

00:30:01.428 --> 00:30:04.015
"through quite a few ruses. Apparently."

00:30:04.015 --> 00:30:10.266
TALIESIN: So you'd be happy to help us find
Cassandra de Rolo, wouldn't you?

00:30:10.305 --> 00:30:14.792
MATT: "If it gets me out of here and gets me free
to do my own business, then yes. I'll have to get

00:30:14.792 --> 00:30:22.071
"a few things from my room, but I would be more
than happy to be free of this desolate landscape.

00:30:22.071 --> 00:30:31.247
"This whole town is a ruin of misery, and it has no
color. It has no culture. I've grown bored of it."

00:30:31.247 --> 00:30:32.778
LAURA: You say you're a scientist.

00:30:32.827 --> 00:30:33.657
MATT: "Yes."

00:30:33.657 --> 00:30:35.661
LAURA: Do you use magic?

00:30:35.661 --> 00:30:47.265
MATT: "I've no interest in paltry magics. I'm more
of one who embraces the sciences as a means of

00:30:47.265 --> 00:30:52.277
"understanding mystery. My whole purpose here was
one giant chemical experiment."

00:30:52.277 --> 00:30:56.234
LAURA: Then who cast Seeming on you?

00:30:56.234 --> 00:30:59.995
MATT: "Oh, that isn't to say I have don't have my
tricks."

00:30:59.995 --> 00:31:10.969
TALIESIN: Anna. You will take us to Cassandra de
Rolo. You will tell us what you know about what's

00:31:11.031 --> 00:31:16.165
in the basement. You will tell us where to find
Lord and Lady Briarwood, and you will tell us

00:31:16.165 --> 00:31:24.627
where to find professor Anders. And for this, we
may let you go.

00:31:24.627 --> 00:31:29.347
MATT: "Hmm, may. That word, 'may.'"

00:31:29.347 --> 00:31:31.632
TALIESIN: I'll let you leave the castle.

00:31:31.632 --> 00:31:39.081
MATT: "And if I agree to these terms, you'll
release me at this moment? Keep me safe until it

00:31:39.081 --> 00:31:41.340
"is time for me to take my leave?"

00:31:41.340 --> 00:31:43.554
SAM: We may chain you to a bear, but yes.

00:31:43.554 --> 00:31:48.872
LAURA: This is Clarota all fucking over again.

00:31:48.929 --> 00:31:57.736
TALIESIN: You are, at the moment, the luckiest
person in Whitestone. Do you know why? Because

00:31:57.736 --> 00:31:59.872
you're at the bottom of my list.

00:31:59.872 --> 00:32:02.145
(laughter)

00:32:02.145 --> 00:32:03.706
TALIESIN: And I take off the hat.

00:32:03.706 --> 00:32:08.614
LAURA and MARISHA: Oh shit!

00:32:08.614 --> 00:32:18.130
MATT: As the peasant image fades, for her, there's
an intensity to her eyes, a widening of

00:32:18.130 --> 00:32:26.374
realization as she steps back instinctually with a
gasp. And there is definite fear in her voice and

00:32:26.374 --> 00:32:32.056
her eyes, but there's an uncontrollable smile on
her face which catches you off guard.

00:32:32.056 --> 00:32:37.159
"Percival." (laughs)

00:32:37.159 --> 00:32:39.049
MARISHA: She's a nervous laugher.

00:32:39.049 --> 00:32:49.838
MATT: "Well, then. This certainly explains a lot.
I have many questions. I found your recent work

00:32:49.838 --> 00:32:51.629
"very fascinating."

00:32:51.629 --> 00:33:00.378
TALIESIN: I will be happy to give you an up close
and very personal demonstration. Unless, of

00:33:00.378 --> 00:33:04.818
course, you would rather have conversations about
other topics.

00:33:04.818 --> 00:33:12.411
MATT: "We'll start with the other topics." She
adjusts her coat, regains her composure, and steps

00:33:12.411 --> 00:33:15.357
up to the bars expectantly.

00:33:15.357 --> 00:33:16.601
SAM: Vax?

00:33:16.601 --> 00:33:21.353
LIAM: All right. I come out of the shadows.

00:33:21.353 --> 00:33:23.761
LAURA: Oh god, are we really letting her out?

00:33:23.761 --> 00:33:27.038
SAM: Get a chain ready, or a noose of some sort.

00:33:27.038 --> 00:33:28.312
TRAVIS: No, we have manacles.

00:33:28.312 --> 00:33:32.312
LAURA: She's got one hand. How's that going to be
useful?

00:33:32.312 --> 00:33:36.335
MARISHA: One hand and then one on the bear,
right?

00:33:36.335 --> 00:33:40.647
TALIESIN: It means there's only one to shoot off
to make sure she won't be a problem.

00:33:40.647 --> 00:33:50.724
LIAM: I pull out a pick and I walk up to the gate
and I say, he's a very good shot. She's a &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt;

00:33:50.758 --> 00:33:52.129
good shot.

00:33:52.129 --> 00:33:57.380
LAURA: He poops on things.

00:33:57.380 --> 00:34:03.684
LIAM: This guy, I've watched turn things into the
Jelly of the Month, so I would tread very

00:34:03.684 --> 00:34:05.486
carefully.

00:34:05.486 --> 00:34:12.110
MARISHA: And then I peek out of the shadows and
go, hi. (giggles)

00:34:12.110 --> 00:34:13.814
LIAM: She's a nervous laugher.

00:34:13.814 --> 00:34:15.594
(laughter)

00:34:15.594 --> 00:34:20.815
MATT: Go ahead and make a check lock pick. This
will be more difficult than normal because--

00:34:20.815 --> 00:34:24.715
LAURA: I snapped off a thing in there. Sorry about
that.

00:34:24.715 --> 00:34:32.227
LIAM: All right, I'm going to use Luck.

00:34:32.256 --> 00:34:34.418
LAURA: You're going to use Luck now?!

00:34:34.418 --> 00:34:35.795
SAM: Shall I inspire you?

00:34:35.795 --> 00:34:40.324
TALIESIN: Don't use Luck yet

00:34:40.406 --> 00:34:44.375
LIAM: It's not that bad. That's a 20.

00:34:44.375 --> 00:34:45.971
MATT: That's a 20 baseline?

00:34:45.971 --> 00:34:48.648
LIAM: Yeah, because of my--

00:34:48.648 --> 00:34:53.177
MATT: Expertise? All right. 20 is exactly what you
needed.

00:34:53.177 --> 00:34:55.166
LIAM: Skadoosh.

00:34:55.166 --> 00:35:02.235
MATT: That was the next one. So you take a moment
you walk up all slick and (click).

00:35:02.235 --> 00:35:04.587
LIAM: Wait. One sec. This never happens.

00:35:04.587 --> 00:35:05.697
(laughter)

00:35:05.697 --> 00:35:09.514
MATT: You have to get down and you spend the next
30 seconds actually managing to get the pin that

00:35:09.514 --> 00:35:12.351
she has stuck in there out without actually
breaking the spring inside.

00:35:12.351 --> 00:35:14.324
LAURA: Sorry about that.

00:35:14.324 --> 00:35:15.494
SAM: Fucking doors!

00:35:15.494 --> 00:35:16.738
LIAM: Shut up!

00:35:16.738 --> 00:35:20.217
LAURA: It never ends!

00:35:20.217 --> 00:35:24.986
MATT: About a minute and a half of awkward quiet
as the sound of scraping metal and jimmying

00:35:24.986 --> 00:35:26.908
thieves' tools, eventually (click).

00:35:26.908 --> 00:35:28.442
LIAM: We're still very tough.

00:35:28.442 --> 00:35:30.602
(laughter)

00:35:30.602 --> 00:35:35.718
MATT: And with that, (ting) the lock comes loose
and the bars (creak) open a little bit.

00:35:35.718 --> 00:35:38.868
LAURA: Trinket, watch her.

00:35:38.868 --> 00:35:43.642
MATT: (grunts) The bear, which at this point has
been barely visible, steps

00:35:43.642 --> 00:35:44.738
out of the shadows, as well--

00:35:44.738 --> 00:35:45.795
SAM: Bear-ly?

00:35:45.795 --> 00:35:47.011
(groaning)

00:35:47.011 --> 00:35:48.044
MATT: It would be you.

00:35:48.044 --> 00:35:49.500
LIAM: Kill him!

00:35:49.500 --> 00:35:59.487
MATT: Steps out and presents a very puffed-up
Trinket made to look intimidating. (growl) Towards

00:35:59.487 --> 00:36:01.557
Dr. Anna Ripley.

00:36:01.557 --> 00:36:11.644
TALIESIN: Here's the deal, Anna. You do what we
ask, you do not betray us, you do not make our

00:36:11.644 --> 00:36:24.481
life difficult in any way, and you have my word
that you will leave Whitestone unmolested by us.

00:36:24.481 --> 00:36:33.267
If I sense the slightest hint, if I have a moment
where I think that you might make a run for it, if

00:36:33.267 --> 00:36:41.058
I have a moment where I think you may cough
inappropriately, I would ask you to think about

00:36:41.058 --> 00:36:47.559
everything you did to me, and I would like you to
know that I have learned so much more than what

00:36:47.559 --> 00:36:56.879
you taught me that day, and I cannot wait to show
you. And I will. But not until I find you again.

00:36:56.879 --> 00:37:08.559
MATT: "Understood, Percival. Well, then. Shall
we?" She steps out of the cell, pushes the bar

00:37:08.559 --> 00:37:15.657
aside, saunters up past you, steps over, still
facing you underneath the torch light.

00:37:15.697 --> 00:37:18.452
SAM: Should we shackle her?

00:37:18.452 --> 00:37:19.612
TALIESIN: No.

00:37:19.612 --> 00:37:21.287
SAM: Oh? All right.

00:37:21.287 --> 00:37:22.870
TALIESIN: It'll arouse suspicion.

00:37:22.870 --> 00:37:24.643
MATT: "I'd like to gather my things."

00:37:24.643 --> 00:37:27.492
SAM: Things? They let you have things in a prison
cell?

00:37:27.492 --> 00:37:30.479
MATT: "Well, I don't have them here in the cell.
They're in my room."

00:37:30.479 --> 00:37:32.318
SAM: We have to go to your room?

00:37:32.318 --> 00:37:34.266
MATT: "I would like to."

00:37:34.266 --> 00:37:36.734
LAURA: Tell us what you need and we'll get it for
you, dear.

00:37:36.734 --> 00:37:44.457
MATT: "Very well. Come." And she begins to step up
the stairway that leads out of the dungeon.

00:37:44.457 --> 00:37:47.346
LAURA: Can you walk quietly? Please?

00:37:47.346 --> 00:37:52.291
MATT: You can hear the slight chuckle in the
darkness. She goes, "I haven't lived this long

00:37:52.291 --> 00:37:54.422
"without learning to step a little gingerly."

00:37:54.422 --> 00:37:59.088
SAM: Oh boy.

00:37:59.088 --> 00:38:01.021
LIAM: Let's go parading through the castle.

00:38:01.021 --> 00:38:03.573
TALIESIN: I'll follow her.

00:38:03.573 --> 00:38:04.559
MATT: Okay.

00:38:04.559 --> 00:38:05.949
SAM: Let's all follow her, right?

00:38:05.949 --> 00:38:11.226
TRAVIS: We should check any of the other cells?

00:38:11.226 --> 00:38:12.960
LAURA: We did. We already checked them all

00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:20.089
MATT: As you're walking up the stairs, she's
talking to you a bit out loud and she's just

00:38:20.089 --> 00:38:28.175
saying, "This whole entire endeavor-- while it did
pay well at the get-go and did pique some of my

00:38:28.175 --> 00:38:36.506
"curiosity, I'm very happy to see it out of my life
after this." You guys get to the top of the stairs

00:38:36.541 --> 00:38:44.891
and there is a closed wooden door there. She comes
to the door and listens to it for a second.

00:38:44.891 --> 00:38:55.949
(creak) Opens it up and looks out. "Huh. Empty."
Holds the door open and says,

00:38:55.949 --> 00:38:58.323
"Who would like to enter?"

00:38:58.323 --> 00:39:00.872
SAM: You would like to enter.

00:39:00.872 --> 00:39:08.026
MATT: "All right, just giving the offer." And
she steps into the room. This is the end of a long

00:39:08.062 --> 00:39:12.188
hallway that leads to a series of doors on the
right and left side, and it opens into a large

00:39:12.188 --> 00:39:24.693
central entrance chamber to what would be the
castle. So she steps in. She's not going too far

00:39:24.693 --> 00:39:29.867
ahead. She's being very conscious that based on
the fact that she has nothing on her and you are

00:39:29.867 --> 00:39:33.207
very well armed, it would not behoove her to
attempt to make a run for it.

00:39:33.207 --> 00:39:36.279
LAURA: Do we see anything in the room?

00:39:36.279 --> 00:39:42.485
TALIESIN: Perception is passive as hell right now.
I am keeping very sharp eye on--

00:39:42.485 --> 00:39:49.716
MATT: No, I understand. Looking around. She's
taking her steps slowly, and she's looking around

00:39:49.716 --> 00:39:54.712
corners as you guys progress. The doors that are
there-- everyone's being very quiet, just the very

00:39:54.712 --> 00:40:04.076
gentle sounds of careful footsteps against the
smooth stone floor. (footsteps) She turns around,

00:40:04.076 --> 00:40:09.315
looking at the rest of you a little confused, and
goes, "Huh. Usually there are a lot more

00:40:09.315 --> 00:40:12.374
"individuals frequenting this castle."

00:40:12.374 --> 00:40:17.739
SAM: Maybe they've been drawn out by the thing
that we incited outside that's been going on for

00:40:17.739 --> 00:40:19.315
like 45 minutes now?

00:40:19.315 --> 00:40:20.679
MARISHA: Feels like a trap.

00:40:20.679 --> 00:40:23.244
LAURA: No, but there is fighting. Can we hear
fighting?

00:40:23.244 --> 00:40:29.931
MATT: You're inside the castle right now. You
could go and if you want to try and enter one of

00:40:29.931 --> 00:40:32.802
the rooms to the right or left, you can see if
there's a window.

00:40:32.802 --> 00:40:36.050
SAM: Are there any open doors?

00:40:36.050 --> 00:40:38.643
MATT: All the doors are currently closed.

00:40:38.643 --> 00:40:41.674
LIAM: I just want to see if I sense anything
around.

00:40:41.674 --> 00:40:42.741
MATT: Okay.

00:40:42.741 --> 00:40:43.910
LIAM: 23.

00:40:43.910 --> 00:40:44.792
MATT: Perception?

00:40:44.792 --> 00:40:45.774
LIAM: Perception, yeah.

00:40:45.774 --> 00:40:54.451
MATT: Okay. You take a moment and listen around.
Silent. Still. It's unnerving.

00:40:54.451 --> 00:40:58.309
SAM: Does she have a window in her room?

00:40:58.309 --> 00:40:59.664
MATT: You asking?

00:40:59.664 --> 00:41:02.299
SAM: We're at her doorway, aren't we?

00:41:02.299 --> 00:41:07.348
MATT: No, you've just stepped up to the base floor
of the castle. You're on the base floor, on the

00:41:07.348 --> 00:41:09.694
side of it. You're not even quite sure which way
is north.

00:41:09.694 --> 00:41:13.381
TRAVIS: Nobody we're looking for is going to be
above us, right? They're going to be below the

00:41:13.381 --> 00:41:14.475
castle.

00:41:14.475 --> 00:41:15.481
SAM: For sure.

00:41:15.481 --> 00:41:18.679
TRAVIS: So we don't want her to get her shit in
her room. We need to be asking how to get below

00:41:18.679 --> 00:41:19.915
the castle.

00:41:19.915 --> 00:41:21.155
TALIESIN: We'll get there.

00:41:21.155 --> 00:41:22.376
SAM: What are you getting?

00:41:22.376 --> 00:41:23.550
MARISHA: She wants her weapons.

00:41:23.550 --> 00:41:25.615
TALIESIN: And I want to see what she's built,
anyway.

00:41:25.615 --> 00:41:26.944
SAM: Why would we let her have a weapon?

00:41:26.944 --> 00:41:28.222
TRAVIS: We're not going to.

00:41:28.222 --> 00:41:31.727
LAURA: Can't we look at what she's built after we
fight them?

00:41:31.727 --> 00:41:33.999
SAM: It could be useful.

00:41:33.999 --> 00:41:39.814
TALIESIN: As we're walking, I just want to very
gently take my gun--

00:41:39.814 --> 00:41:41.775
SAM: And shoot her with it.

00:41:41.775 --> 00:41:43.749
(laughter)

00:41:43.749 --> 00:41:48.754
TALIESIN: And just put it gently at her back,
going, nothing personal.

00:41:48.805 --> 00:41:51.148
I'm just feeling a bit nervous.

00:41:51.148 --> 00:42:00.245
MATT: "Understood." She straightens up a little
more and continues walking ever so carefully. Not

00:42:00.245 --> 00:42:04.115
quite leaning her head or making too many large
movements, but definitely still keeping a

00:42:04.115 --> 00:42:08.746
seemingly nervous eye on how quiet the atmosphere
is.

00:42:08.746 --> 00:42:11.500
LAURA: I creep over to one of the doors in the
room and see if I can hear

00:42:11.500 --> 00:42:13.351
anything on the other side.

00:42:13.351 --> 00:42:19.155
MATT: You don't hear anything inside the room.
Roll a perception check.

00:42:19.155 --> 00:42:27.105
LAURA: (groans) 14.

00:42:27.105 --> 00:42:39.416
MATT: You hear some slight, muffled, dull thud
noise, but you can't really tell how close it is.

00:42:39.416 --> 00:42:41.320
It's very, very faint.

00:42:41.320 --> 00:42:44.473
LAURA: Can I see if the door handle is--

00:42:44.473 --> 00:42:47.144
MATT: (click) It's open.

00:42:47.144 --> 00:42:49.043
LAURA: I step to the side and push it open.

00:42:49.043 --> 00:42:53.412
MATT: Push it open (creak) The door opens.
Everyone before you whips around, hearing the

00:42:53.465 --> 00:43:07.259
noise in the silence. Looking inside, it appears
to be a long-untouched music room, a space for

00:43:07.259 --> 00:43:12.850
hosting individuals where you would have small
performances, and there is a very cold fireplace

00:43:12.850 --> 00:43:21.680
in the far corner. There is a small, circular
window that is placed in the center of the room

00:43:21.680 --> 00:43:26.945
that has a very thick glass pane with cross bar on
it that seems to look out. And this is your first

00:43:26.945 --> 00:43:31.164
view-- for you, especially, since you woke up in
the tunnel-- your first view of the outside.

00:43:31.164 --> 00:43:32.602
LAURA: And?

00:43:32.602 --> 00:43:34.482
MATT: Do you go up to the window and look?

00:43:34.482 --> 00:43:35.912
LAURA: Sure.

00:43:35.912 --> 00:43:38.401
LIAM: I'm following my sister in, doing the buddy
cop thing.

00:43:38.401 --> 00:43:46.905
MATT: Okay. You two coast up to the glass and look
out, and another cloud-covered, slightly drizzly

00:43:46.905 --> 00:43:55.917
morning has taken the caldera between the
mountains that houses Whitestone in this forest.

00:43:55.917 --> 00:44:04.141
You can see the entire city of Whitestone down
below this elevated part of topography. What you

00:44:04.141 --> 00:44:10.909
do see, one, are large plumes of smoke, about six
or seven of them, all gathered towards what you

00:44:10.909 --> 00:44:14.012
can tell now is the north side of the city, which
is the closest to you. You guys are on the

00:44:14.012 --> 00:44:18.511
southwest side of the castle, based on the spatial
awareness you've now made.

00:44:18.511 --> 00:44:22.505
MARISHA: Where the more upper-class folk would
live, I'm assuming?

00:44:22.505 --> 00:44:29.543
MATT: Go ahead and roll perception check, while
you're glancing out.

00:44:29.543 --> 00:44:30.871
MARISHA: Sure.

00:44:30.871 --> 00:44:34.676
LIAM: So close.

00:44:34.676 --> 00:44:36.312
LAURA: That could've been so bad. 20.

00:44:36.312 --> 00:44:37.152
MATT: Okay.

00:44:37.152 --> 00:44:38.888
LAURA: It was like whee-- oh.

00:44:38.888 --> 00:44:44.555
MATT: (laughing) Love those little (gasps)
moments. Taking a moment, you pull your brother in

00:44:44.555 --> 00:44:51.200
to point out where you're looking. It looks like
the gates to the castle are wide open. There are

00:44:51.200 --> 00:44:57.521
tracks through the mud that lead down the pathway
to the bottom, and right where the path from the

00:44:57.521 --> 00:45:03.973
castle intersects with the outer wall of
Whitestone, there is a fray going on right now. It

00:45:03.973 --> 00:45:08.202
looks like the remnants of whatever sort of undead
army that wasn't destroyed by you guys, combined

00:45:08.202 --> 00:45:14.068
with what may have been a number of the
individuals who normally guard the castle, have

00:45:14.068 --> 00:45:20.930
all been momentarily distracted by the rebellion
you guys have started, and for the time being, at

00:45:20.930 --> 00:45:25.043
least, have left elements of this castle
unguarded.

00:45:25.043 --> 00:45:33.043
LAURA: Nice. I would loot, but it's Percival's
home. Do we see anything that looks like it could

00:45:33.043 --> 00:45:35.243
be a doorway leading down, or anything?

00:45:35.243 --> 00:45:36.514
SAM: We've gone up, right?

00:45:36.514 --> 00:45:38.453
LAURA: We're on the main level.

00:45:38.453 --> 00:45:39.995
TALIESIN: We're going to try to get my sister
first.

00:45:40.039 --> 00:45:42.218
LAURA: Do you know, Percival, how to go under?

00:45:42.218 --> 00:45:46.263
TALIESIN: Yes. Unless there's something new, then
yes. I was born here.

00:45:46.263 --> 00:45:54.273
LIAM: Before my sister leaves, I grab her by the
arm and say, "Listen to me--"

00:45:54.273 --> 00:45:57.250
(creaking)

00:45:57.250 --> 00:46:06.145
LIAM: What is that? Pizza. Forget I said that.
Listen to me, I do not have a good feeling about

00:46:06.145 --> 00:46:15.521
this. And I start to undo the cloak that's on me,
And I want you to wear this. And I tie an elven

00:46:15.521 --> 00:46:22.077
cloak. Shut up, please. I don't need it. You will
wear this. You will stay hidden when it is needed.

00:46:22.077 --> 00:46:30.087
You almost lost me. I almost lost you. You will
wear this as needed.

00:46:30.087 --> 00:46:35.345
LAURA: I will wear it. Thank you.

00:46:35.345 --> 00:46:38.093
LIAM: I walk out ahead of her.

00:46:38.093 --> 00:46:47.581
MATT: Pull the hood up. So you get advantage on
stealth checks. As you guys step into the hallway

00:46:47.581 --> 00:46:57.186
and move forward, Pike's physical form is drifting
along you guys as she takes each step. You can see

00:46:57.229 --> 00:47:03.437
she's stopped a little bit and she's lost in
thought for a moment. And she looks at the rest of

00:47:03.437 --> 00:47:12.513
you and says, "There is a great evil here. It's--"
And you can see part of her form flicker and shake

00:47:12.513 --> 00:47:19.305
and almost blink for a moment, and then she
reaches forward and says, "Something's willing me

00:47:19.305 --> 00:47:22.541
"away. I ca--" And with that, her form just
vanishes.

00:47:22.640 --> 00:47:23.844
LAURA: Oh no!

00:47:23.844 --> 00:47:27.607
TALIESIN: Damn.

00:47:27.607 --> 00:47:34.724
MATT: As you feel this warmth on your hand, Vax,
and the symbol of Sarenrae that you have embedded

00:47:34.724 --> 00:47:40.769
in your glove. You look down, and it has a slight
glow to it, similar to the color that her divine

00:47:40.769 --> 00:47:47.990
energy form had taken. And you see it just slowly
fade, but not entirely. The symbol seems to just

00:47:47.990 --> 00:47:54.489
have this general very faint radiation. A
reminder, or at least what small semblance of a

00:47:54.489 --> 00:47:56.887
connection to her in this dark, dark place.

00:47:56.887 --> 00:47:59.698
LIAM: (whispering) Goodbye, Pike.

00:47:59.698 --> 00:48:05.008
TRAVIS: Before we move on from that foyer, can we
see the front door from where we're at?

00:48:05.008 --> 00:48:10.643
MATT: If you go another 20, 30 feet ahead to the
end of this hallway, it should open up into the

00:48:10.643 --> 00:48:13.316
main entrance chamber and you would be able to see
the doors.

00:48:13.316 --> 00:48:14.486
TRAVIS: So we're not there yet, okay.

00:48:14.486 --> 00:48:19.587
TALIESIN: I'm going to take a moment and I have an
epiphany, and I'm going to shift my form into a

00:48:19.587 --> 00:48:21.048
castle guard.

00:48:21.048 --> 00:48:22.667
MATT: Okay.

00:48:22.667 --> 00:48:31.127
SAM: Vex, what you saw through the window, should
we move through the castle quickly because it's

00:48:31.127 --> 00:48:32.459
unguarded?

00:48:32.459 --> 00:48:36.821
LAURA: I guess. There's fighting going on now. I
don't want to eat right now.

00:48:36.821 --> 00:48:39.443
TALIESIN: We'll get it on the break.

00:48:39.443 --> 00:48:49.901
LAURA: I saw fighting, lots of fighting. I feel
like if we're going to move, we need to do it

00:48:49.936 --> 00:48:50.873
quickly.

00:48:50.873 --> 00:48:52.366
TRAVIS: Yeah, we're on a clock.

00:48:52.366 --> 00:48:53.715
SAM: Okay, let's go.

00:48:53.715 --> 00:49:01.278
TALIESIN: Anna. I lower the gun and let her move
forward.

00:49:01.278 --> 00:49:03.166
TRAVIS: You don't need to lower it.

00:49:03.166 --> 00:49:17.243
MATT: She continues forward, heads towards the
rest of the hallway into the main entrance chamber

00:49:17.243 --> 00:49:23.147
of the castle, very carefully looking about. She
gestures to the rest of you to follow. And as you

00:49:23.147 --> 00:49:28.170
follow along beside her, you can see the two large
front doors that situate the entrance, the main

00:49:28.170 --> 00:49:29.665
entrance to Whitestone--

00:49:29.665 --> 00:49:30.951
SAM: Are they open?

00:49:30.951 --> 00:49:32.283
MATT: No, they are closed.

00:49:32.283 --> 00:49:38.229
TRAVIS: I have 20 caltrops. Can I throw ten of
them in front of the door?

00:49:38.229 --> 00:49:39.954
MATT: Yeah, if you'd like to.

00:49:39.954 --> 00:49:43.197
(laughter)

00:49:43.197 --> 00:49:46.291
MATT: They scatter and clink against the ground,
scraping against the stone and eventually coming

00:49:46.291 --> 00:49:52.121
to a stop loosely around the two doors, which are
about eight feet wide each, so 16 feet of it, so

00:49:52.148 --> 00:49:55.059
you're scattering about one every foot and a
half.

00:49:55.059 --> 00:49:59.557
LIAM: I watched him do that, and I shrug and I
reach into my pack, and I throw 30 more of them.

00:49:59.557 --> 00:50:04.498
MATT: Okay. The area has a little more coverage on
there, but nevertheless there is a nice cluster of

00:50:04.498 --> 00:50:07.446
nasty spiked caltrops now.

00:50:07.494 --> 00:50:10.450
LAURA: That was a good idea. Very smart there.

00:50:10.450 --> 00:50:11.621
TRAVIS: Yeah. Thank you.

00:50:11.621 --> 00:50:12.861
SAM: Grog, using your noggin.

00:50:12.861 --> 00:50:14.034
TRAVIS: One a day.

00:50:14.034 --> 00:50:15.195
(laughter)

00:50:15.195 --> 00:50:20.479
TALIESIN: Was that a thought for the day, then?
Don't sprain yourself. We need you later.

00:50:20.479 --> 00:50:22.057
TRAVIS: I'm back.

00:50:22.057 --> 00:50:24.108
(laughter)

00:50:24.108 --> 00:50:32.224
MATT: Ripley starts making her way up the stairs,
and the staircase ascends for a good 15 feet up

00:50:32.224 --> 00:50:35.176
before it splits into two curved stairways that
come around to a second landing

00:50:35.176 --> 00:50:36.505
to the second floor.

00:50:36.505 --> 00:50:39.797
MARISHA: So hang on one second, real quick, he's
dressed as a guard?

00:50:39.797 --> 00:50:40.898
TALIESIN: Yes.

00:50:40.898 --> 00:50:48.444
MARISHA: I'm going to go ahead and cast Enhance
Ability on you. For charisma.

00:50:48.444 --> 00:50:49.997
TALIESIN: I don't need it.

00:50:49.997 --> 00:50:51.843
MATT: Well, you do now.

00:50:51.843 --> 00:50:53.290
TALIESIN: Has it worn off?

00:50:53.290 --> 00:50:55.020
MATT: It lasts for a minute, so yeah, it's worn
off.

00:50:55.020 --> 00:50:56.464
MARISHA: Oh, it only lasts for a minute?

00:50:56.464 --> 00:50:58.872
MATT: Friends only lasts for a minute.

00:50:58.872 --> 00:51:02.181
TALIESIN: I had enhance charisma on for a while,
but now it's gone, so if you do it,

00:51:02.181 --> 00:51:06.941
what I had is gone--

00:51:06.941 --> 00:51:08.854
TRAVIS: Pour some sugar on, Keyleth.

00:51:08.854 --> 00:51:12.705
MARISHA: I'll do it. I'm going to enhance. In case
we get busted. So you'll have advantage on

00:51:12.705 --> 00:51:13.874
persuasion rolls.

00:51:13.874 --> 00:51:16.094
MATT: Okay, so you have advantage on all
charisma-based ability checks.

00:51:16.094 --> 00:51:18.286
TALIESIN: All right, putting that down.

00:51:18.286 --> 00:51:20.514
MARISHA: Also, no one forget that we have Heroes'
Feast.

00:51:20.514 --> 00:51:27.950
LAURA: Wait, if I put the holy oil on things, it
lasts for a few hours, right? It lasts for half a

00:51:27.950 --> 00:51:29.106
day or something?

00:51:29.106 --> 00:51:31.187
MATT: I'd say it lasts for about an hour after
application.

00:51:31.187 --> 00:51:33.110
TALIESIN: Wait until we're in the thick of it.

00:51:33.110 --> 00:51:36.537
MATT: The oil will eventually just drift off, as
it is an oil.

00:51:36.537 --> 00:51:37.906
LAURA: It dries and stuff.

00:51:37.906 --> 00:51:41.209
MATT: Yeah, it dries and gets rubbed off. It lasts
about an hour after application.

00:51:41.209 --> 00:51:43.877
TALIESIN: Let's head to her room.

00:51:43.877 --> 00:51:51.966
MATT: Okay. You head up the stairs. She's being
very quiet about it. She comes up to the landing,

00:51:51.966 --> 00:51:57.938
heads to the first major hallway that opens up
into a long set that goes all the way to the

00:51:57.938 --> 00:52:06.623
eastern side of the castle. You recognize this
area. This is where a number of smaller guest

00:52:06.623 --> 00:52:16.737
rooms were arranged. There's also a reading room.
Around the corner and down the way is where your

00:52:16.737 --> 00:52:26.277
father's study is. And around the back is where
Professor Anders's study was. She continues

00:52:26.277 --> 00:52:31.099
forward and eventually stops at a door halfway
down the hall. Motions to all of you.

00:52:31.099 --> 00:52:33.890
"Do you mind?"

00:52:33.890 --> 00:52:36.751
LAURA: What do you want? What's in there?

00:52:36.751 --> 00:52:38.682
MATT: "My belongings."

00:52:38.682 --> 00:52:41.088
TALIESIN: I want to see what you've been working
on.

00:52:41.088 --> 00:52:45.881
MATT: "All right." She opens the door. (creak)

00:52:45.881 --> 00:52:48.150
MARISHA: I'll wait outside and stand watch.

00:52:48.150 --> 00:52:49.553
LAURA: I walk in with her.

00:52:49.553 --> 00:52:51.151
TRAVIS: I stay right next to her.

00:52:51.151 --> 00:53:02.699
MATT: So in her room, it's very plainly decorated.
You know these rooms are generally very well

00:53:02.699 --> 00:53:08.049
decorated, just in case. Decorations have been
taken off. This room looks very minimalistic and

00:53:08.049 --> 00:53:15.527
for the most part more for function than anything
else. You see there is plain sheets on the bed,

00:53:15.527 --> 00:53:23.559
most of the room's open space is taken by a long
table that's been put here that has a series of

00:53:23.559 --> 00:53:31.685
alchemical glassware, and you can see what looks
to be small containers that contain different

00:53:31.685 --> 00:53:40.142
materials and powders and seems like she does her
own work here. There are two open drums on the

00:53:40.142 --> 00:53:52.340
side, and there is this very caustic smell to the
air. There is an acerbic tinge to the nose as soon

00:53:52.340 --> 00:53:58.177
as the room enters. There's just this
ever-present, very heavy fresh rust smell to the

00:53:58.177 --> 00:54:06.580
room. She walks to the far end. Underneath the
desk that contains this alchemical setup, she

00:54:06.580 --> 00:54:08.699
pulls a small chest out--

00:54:08.699 --> 00:54:10.705
TALIESIN: I watch very carefully.

00:54:10.705 --> 00:54:14.875
MATT: She brings the chest to the top. She opens
it up, and on the inside you can see just some

00:54:14.875 --> 00:54:19.144
folded clothing. She moves the clothing off to the
side and she pulls out what looks like relatively

00:54:19.144 --> 00:54:22.304
simple leather armor. "May I?"

00:54:22.620 --> 00:54:27.616
TRAVIS: Very, very slowly.

00:54:27.616 --> 00:54:29.546
LAURA: Don't be creepy, Grog.

00:54:29.546 --> 00:54:30.687
(laughter)

00:54:30.687 --> 00:54:34.335
TRAVIS: Creepy? I'm going to put her through the
wall if she moves in the wrong way.

00:54:34.335 --> 00:54:36.899
TALIESIN: You know, I almost killed you in
Stillben.

00:54:36.899 --> 00:54:38.827
MATT: "Really?"

00:54:38.827 --> 00:54:41.305
TALIESIN: Do you remember?

00:54:41.305 --> 00:54:44.263
MATT: "Huh. I didn't know that was you."

00:54:44.263 --> 00:54:47.298
TALIESIN: I was kind of curious if you had figured
it out or not.

00:54:47.298 --> 00:54:48.466
MATT: "No."

00:54:48.466 --> 00:54:51.936
LAURA: Tell you what, I'll hold onto that armor
for the time being.

00:54:51.936 --> 00:54:53.339
MATT: She's partway into it.

00:54:53.339 --> 00:54:56.298
LAURA: Yeah, you can take it off. We'll put it in
the Bag of Holding. You can put it

00:54:56.298 --> 00:54:57.949
on after we're done.

00:54:57.949 --> 00:55:04.516
MATT: (heavy sigh) She folds the tunic portion
over the chest piece and hands it to you, pulls

00:55:04.516 --> 00:55:07.570
out some of the arm braces and leg guards and
hands those over as well.

00:55:07.570 --> 00:55:09.739
TALIESIN: Show me your work.

00:55:09.739 --> 00:55:17.608
MATT: She goes underneath the chest and she pulls
out two small glass vials and sets them on the

00:55:17.608 --> 00:55:23.521
side. She then reaches underneath and pulls up
what looks to be a false bottom of the chest.

00:55:23.521 --> 00:55:31.752
Places it. At which point she reaches in and pulls
out a metallic construction that you all see looks

00:55:31.752 --> 00:55:37.347
not unlike in shape and purpose as the Pepperbox
that you've seen Percy use all this time, though

00:55:37.347 --> 00:55:46.195
it has only a single barrel and has a small
rotating four-part chamber to it. It's a little

00:55:46.195 --> 00:55:54.803
more refined than his construction, and you can
see now part of the alchemical setup she has in

00:55:54.803 --> 00:56:00.219
here actually is, and you recognize this as you
get close, part of it is designed in the creation

00:56:00.219 --> 00:56:08.262
of ammunition and refining the powder that is used
by this process. You see a series of notes that

00:56:08.262 --> 00:56:13.876
are off to the side that have sketches outlined of
your Pepperbox, though not really accurate. Almost

00:56:13.876 --> 00:56:20.173
like they were recalled from various individuals
that had seen it in person and given accounts of

00:56:20.173 --> 00:56:24.423
it. She's been keeping a very close log of
eyewitness accounts of your weaponry, apparently,

00:56:24.423 --> 00:56:25.866
for some time.

00:56:25.866 --> 00:56:28.065
SAM: She's a fangirl.

00:56:28.065 --> 00:56:29.094
MARISHA: Yeah, she is.

00:56:29.094 --> 00:56:33.708
TALIESIN: I'm disappointed. I was expecting
something more imaginative.

00:56:33.708 --> 00:56:38.289
MATT: (laughs) "You've seen my room, have you not?
I prefer function."

00:56:38.289 --> 00:56:42.520
TALIESIN: (scoffs) Hack.

00:56:42.520 --> 00:56:43.932
MATT: She reaches down and--

00:56:43.932 --> 00:56:45.991
TRAVIS: Keep your hands away and step back.

00:56:45.991 --> 00:56:49.238
TALIESIN: We'll give those to you when it's time
to leave.

00:56:49.238 --> 00:56:55.582
MATT: "How am I to defend myself should things go,
and pardon my term, ass-up?"

00:56:55.582 --> 00:57:00.620
LAURA: Are you planning on fighting with us?
Helping us?

00:57:00.620 --> 00:57:05.270
MATT: "You say you won't release me until you've
finished what you're doing here. I assume that what

00:57:05.305 --> 00:57:11.911
"you're doing here is ending the current reign of
those who rule this town. I can't assume that's

00:57:11.911 --> 00:57:14.238
"going to end with a conversation."

00:57:14.238 --> 00:57:16.744
LIAM: I lean my head in and say, the goliath
could turn your head into paste now,

00:57:16.744 --> 00:57:18.146
if you like.

00:57:18.146 --> 00:57:23.578
LAURA: Tell you what, we'll take the weapons and
give it to you if we need your help.

00:57:23.578 --> 00:57:28.664
TALIESIN: Let her have the armor. As a sign of
good faith.

00:57:28.664 --> 00:57:30.502
TRAVIS: What if it's enchanted armor?

00:57:30.502 --> 00:57:38.023
TALIESIN: And give me your ammunition. And when
it's time, I will hand some to you.

00:57:38.023 --> 00:57:40.990
SAM: So you're leaving her the weapons but no
ammo?

00:57:40.990 --> 00:57:42.219
LAURA: No, I'm taking the weapon.

00:57:42.219 --> 00:57:43.526
TALIESIN: The weapon's useless.

00:57:43.526 --> 00:57:45.151
LAURA: I don't care.

00:57:45.151 --> 00:57:49.445
MATT: She gives you the weapon begrudgingly. Hands
you a pouch about this big that's pretty heavy,

00:57:49.445 --> 00:57:58.609
containing a series of iron balls inside. You can
see there's the various instruments she uses for

00:57:58.609 --> 00:58:03.335
forging them and crafting them there across the
table. She puts her hand out towards you for the

00:58:03.335 --> 00:58:09.080
armor. She puts it on, a little quicker this time,
because she feels like she had a little victory.

00:58:09.080 --> 00:58:14.574
She takes a little vial, puts it in her pocket.
She reaches over and grabs a little pouch inside

00:58:14.574 --> 00:58:20.055
the side with change. Puts a little bit of money
to the side there.

00:58:20.055 --> 00:58:23.319
TRAVIS: What are in those vials?

00:58:23.319 --> 00:58:29.006
MATT: She reaches in, pulls them out, shows them
to you. And you recognize the color. She goes,

00:58:29.006 --> 00:58:35.414
"What, you think you're the only one who doesn't
occasionally suffer a wound? I have to look after

00:58:35.414 --> 00:58:39.310
"myself, as well." It's a greater healing potion.

00:58:39.310 --> 00:58:41.610
TRAVIS: One of them is? Or they both are?

00:58:41.610 --> 00:58:43.295
MATT: The one she pulled out and showed you.

00:58:43.295 --> 00:58:45.115
TRAVIS: What about the other one?

00:58:45.115 --> 00:58:48.301
(laughter)

00:58:48.301 --> 00:58:49.603
MATT: "Really?"

00:58:49.603 --> 00:58:53.873
TRAVIS: Really. Lest your brains leak out your
ears.

00:58:53.873 --> 00:59:01.287
MATT: She pulls out the other one. "This is in
case things go really poorly and I need to uphold

00:59:01.287 --> 00:59:03.831
"my sense of self-preservation."

00:59:03.831 --> 00:59:05.987
LAURA: What does that mean?

00:59:05.987 --> 00:59:07.801
TRAVIS: Yeah, what does that mean?

00:59:07.801 --> 00:59:12.109
MATT: (sighs angrily)

00:59:12.109 --> 00:59:14.185
TALIESIN: Convince us to let you keep it.

00:59:14.185 --> 00:59:19.170
MATT: "It allows me to make a fleeting escape on
the air as opposed to by foot."

00:59:19.170 --> 00:59:24.620
LAURA: Oh. Well, then give it to me.

00:59:24.620 --> 00:59:26.017
TRAVIS: Axe.

00:59:26.017 --> 00:59:28.134
(laughter)

00:59:28.134 --> 00:59:32.176
MATT: And with that, the glass almost shatters
with the amount of frustrating force she slams

00:59:32.176 --> 00:59:33.609
it into your hand.

00:59:33.609 --> 00:59:36.352
LAURA: Careful. That's made of glass, darling.

00:59:36.396 --> 00:59:39.822
TRAVIS: I was only stretching. No need to get
testy.

00:59:39.822 --> 00:59:42.136
MATT: So you have a Potion of Flying in your
inventory right now.

00:59:42.136 --> 00:59:47.426
TALIESIN: And god forbid you'll see how gracious
we're feeling when we find Cassandra De Rolo

00:59:47.426 --> 00:59:48.407
unhurt.

00:59:48.407 --> 00:59:51.832
SAM: Yeah, Grog! Grog with the steal.

00:59:51.832 --> 00:59:54.347
LAURA: Ooh, I get a piece of paper!

00:59:54.347 --> 00:59:55.627
TRAVIS: Shit, Potion of Flying.

00:59:55.627 --> 00:59:57.096
LAURA: This is awesome.

00:59:57.096 --> 01:00:00.236
SAM: All right, do you have your shit? Can we get
out of here?

01:00:00.236 --> 01:00:05.404
MATT: "Yes. Everything else here is of no interest
to me." She kicks one of the drums on the way out.

01:00:05.404 --> 01:00:07.256
Slips back into the hallway.

01:00:07.256 --> 01:00:08.749
SAM: Anything you could use, Percival?

01:00:08.749 --> 01:00:12.765
TALIESIN: Was there any more black powder? I've
taken all of her ammunition and black powder, I

01:00:12.765 --> 01:00:14.906
suppose. Anything else that looks useful to me?

01:00:14.906 --> 01:00:17.286
MATT: Make an investigation check.

01:00:17.286 --> 01:00:21.877
TALIESIN: That's intelligence.

01:00:21.877 --> 01:00:23.027
MATT: Yeah.

01:00:23.027 --> 01:00:24.384
TALIESIN: Oh. Well, hell. Eight.

01:00:24.384 --> 01:00:31.991
MATT: Eight? You give a quick once-over of the
room. The place is pretty barren. Other than the

01:00:32.096 --> 01:00:39.569
large drums of what seems like three inches of
some weird caustic substance at the bottom.

01:00:39.569 --> 01:00:41.512
TALIESIN: I hate what you've done with the place.

01:00:41.512 --> 01:00:45.358
MATT: It's a recurring substance. A lot of the
vials are based around it. There's a recurring

01:00:45.358 --> 01:00:48.896
theme of this caustic liquid throughout all of her
instruments.

01:00:48.896 --> 01:00:52.952
TALIESIN: We'll have a conversation about what she
was trying to do off-camera so I can have a better

01:00:52.952 --> 01:00:54.372
understanding of it.

01:00:54.372 --> 01:00:56.508
MATT: In what way?

01:00:56.508 --> 01:01:00.739
TALIESIN: I figure I may poke you later to get a
better understanding, just so we don't have to

01:01:00.739 --> 01:01:07.659
bore other people with her technical
accoutrements, but I would like, at some point, an

01:01:07.659 --> 01:01:12.674
out-of-character understanding of what I'm looking
at. Of what I could discern

01:01:12.674 --> 01:01:14.611
about what I'm looking at.

01:01:14.611 --> 01:01:16.094
MATT: Or we could have it on camera.

01:01:16.094 --> 01:01:17.868
TALIESIN: All right. No, I just figured it'd be, I
don't want to--

01:01:17.868 --> 01:01:19.259
(laughter)

01:01:19.259 --> 01:01:20.346
TALIESIN: I want to kill something tonight.

01:01:20.346 --> 01:01:23.080
LAURA: Yeah! We were also running out of time.

01:01:23.080 --> 01:01:24.214
TALIESIN: Exactly.

01:01:24.214 --> 01:01:27.150
LAURA: There are people fighting right now.

01:01:27.150 --> 01:01:29.557
TALIESIN: Committed as much to memory as possible.
Let's go.

01:01:29.557 --> 01:01:35.375
LAURA: When we defeat the Briarwoods, you can come
back and explore this room to your heart's

01:01:35.375 --> 01:01:36.276
content.

01:01:36.276 --> 01:01:37.275
TALIESIN: Touche.

01:01:37.275 --> 01:01:38.516
MARISHA: It'd still be your place.

01:01:38.516 --> 01:01:42.209
MATT: "Now, to your sister, is it?"

01:01:42.209 --> 01:01:45.049
SAM: Up or down?

01:01:45.049 --> 01:01:48.033
MATT: "This would be on the other side of this
floor."

01:01:48.033 --> 01:01:49.369
TALIESIN: Which room?

01:01:49.369 --> 01:01:57.510
MATT: "I think you know the room." And you know
that you're not too far from your sister's room.

01:01:57.510 --> 01:01:59.472
MARISHA: They let her keep her room.

01:01:59.472 --> 01:02:05.799
LIAM: See you later. I go stealth. 20. No, 23.

01:02:05.848 --> 01:02:13.162
MATT: As you guys make your way across the other
side of the hallway, back toward the western side

01:02:13.162 --> 01:02:19.039
of the castle, eventually finding where, not far
from where your room was, as well as the rooms of your

01:02:19.039 --> 01:02:25.124
brother and Cassandra. They're all localized in
this one area of the castle, so you were all

01:02:25.124 --> 01:02:29.765
nearby. She goes straight to Cassandra's room.
Goes to the door and doesn't touch it yet.

01:02:29.765 --> 01:02:37.519
TALIESIN: A quick question before I open this
door. Am I going to have a violent reaction

01:02:37.519 --> 01:02:39.617
towards you when I open it?

01:02:39.617 --> 01:02:42.128
MATT: "I certainly hope not."

01:02:42.128 --> 01:02:46.495
TALIESIN: Good. (sighs)

01:02:46.495 --> 01:02:48.610
TRAVIS: I stand right behind her.

01:02:48.610 --> 01:02:58.361
TALIESIN: I motion to everyone, stay back, open
the door, and I push Dr. Ripley into the room,

01:02:58.409 --> 01:03:00.301
with me behind her.

01:03:00.301 --> 01:03:07.754
MATT: Okay. As you pull the door open, (creak) you
push her in. The room is dark. There is no light.

01:03:07.754 --> 01:03:13.565
What little bit of light that peeks in from the
hallways in the poorly-lit interior of the castle

01:03:13.565 --> 01:03:20.192
for this time of day. You can see there is her
canopy bed. You can see there is her cabinet in

01:03:20.192 --> 01:03:23.162
the corner, but the room appears to be dark and
empty.

01:03:23.162 --> 01:03:26.143
TALIESIN: Torch.

01:03:26.143 --> 01:03:29.500
MARISHA: Are there any wall sconces around? Torch
wall sconces on the outside?

01:03:29.500 --> 01:03:33.140
MATT: There are a few along the walls that are
currently burnt out at this point.

01:03:33.140 --> 01:03:38.258
TRAVIS: I take a torch out of the Bag of Holding
and I take the Firebrand War Hammer, ignite it,

01:03:38.258 --> 01:03:40.219
and hand the torch to Percy.

01:03:40.219 --> 01:03:48.320
MATT: Okay. You glance about the room. It's lived
in. The actual bed covers themselves are pulled

01:03:48.320 --> 01:04:00.306
off. You can see she has a vanity mirror cabinet
in the far corner. It's all put away. The chair's

01:04:00.306 --> 01:04:07.803
open a little, like it was stepped out of. The
room is absent of anyone.

01:04:07.803 --> 01:04:11.117
TALIESIN: I walk over to the closet. I open it.

01:04:11.117 --> 01:04:18.714
MATT: Okay. You open the closet. She has outfits
there. Many of them don't appear to have been worn

01:04:18.714 --> 01:04:20.148
in a while.

01:04:20.148 --> 01:04:24.682
TALIESIN: Looking for signs of life with the paper
on the desk.

01:04:24.682 --> 01:04:27.170
MATT: You search her desk?

01:04:27.170 --> 01:04:28.356
TALIESIN: Yes.

01:04:28.356 --> 01:04:30.619
MATT: Make an investigation check.

01:04:30.619 --> 01:04:32.295
TALIESIN: Let's have a real roll. That will do.

01:04:32.295 --> 01:04:34.273
MARISHA: That's a really good roll.

01:04:34.273 --> 01:04:36.093
TALIESIN: That's a natural 20.

01:04:36.093 --> 01:04:37.413
TRAVIS: It is?

01:04:37.413 --> 01:04:38.584
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:04:38.584 --> 01:04:40.976
SAM: Classic Percy.

01:04:40.976 --> 01:04:42.957
MATT: All right.

01:04:42.957 --> 01:04:45.817
TALIESIN: It was doing this on Group Hug, man.

01:04:45.817 --> 01:04:55.801
MATT: You go through her vanity cabinet, and you
find there's small gems there. Just little

01:04:55.801 --> 01:05:05.402
keepsakes of hers. Things from her childhood. You
do find there is a tattered portrait of her and

01:05:05.402 --> 01:05:11.767
your brothers and you that appears to be partially
burned on one side that is kept on its own at the

01:05:11.767 --> 01:05:20.555
bottom of the top shelf. You can see currently it
just shows half of your face, her next to you, and

01:05:20.555 --> 01:05:24.333
your other three brothers to the side. The rest of
the family is burned off at the top point, but

01:05:24.333 --> 01:05:28.761
this was once a portrait that was in one of the
hallways that apparently was destroyed in the

01:05:28.761 --> 01:05:33.971
initial attack or since then. And she's kept this
scrap as some sort of memory and hid it within her

01:05:34.012 --> 01:05:35.002
cabinet.

01:05:35.002 --> 01:05:44.708
You also do find a stack of paper, a series of
partially-written notes and ink and quill that are

01:05:44.708 --> 01:05:50.538
false stops. Letters that were partially written
and then crossed off, or mistakes were made or

01:05:50.538 --> 01:06:01.309
they never got finished that are all written to
Archibald. And they talk about the general unrest

01:06:01.309 --> 01:06:15.356
in the city. Preparation for a possible coming
rebellion. Discussing past failures but the intent

01:06:15.356 --> 01:06:22.173
to try again. There's a theme through a lot of
these notes that this appears to be one of the

01:06:22.173 --> 01:06:27.545
methods she was using to communicate in the
outside of the castle, and was her role in

01:06:27.545 --> 01:06:30.768
previous attempts at freeing the people of
Whitestone.

01:06:30.768 --> 01:06:34.282
TALIESIN: She's not here.

01:06:34.282 --> 01:06:40.034
MATT: You see Ripley's also like, "Well, if she's
not here, she's somewhere else in

01:06:40.034 --> 01:06:42.442
"the castle. I assume."

01:06:42.442 --> 01:06:44.016
TALIESIN: Where would she be?

01:06:44.016 --> 01:06:54.082
MATT: "I don't spend my time wondering or curious
about her well-being! I just know that she is

01:06:54.082 --> 01:06:55.437
"usually here."

01:06:55.437 --> 01:07:05.197
TALIESIN: Anna. I'm going to take a leap of faith
and believe, contrary to all evidence, that you

01:07:05.197 --> 01:07:16.708
are a smart woman. I pull out the gun, and I put
it to her head. Now. If you were the Briarwoods,

01:07:16.708 --> 01:07:20.372
where would you put my sister?

01:07:20.372 --> 01:07:29.967
LAURA: An important question here, Percy. Are they
keeping her, or is she here of her own volition?

01:07:29.967 --> 01:07:35.075
TALIESIN: I don't know. And if you don't know,
make me believe it.

01:07:35.075 --> 01:07:47.610
MATT: "I know she's not allowed anywhere near the
ziggurat or near our distillery."

01:07:47.644 --> 01:07:50.359
TALIESIN: Distillery? I pull the gun away.

01:07:50.359 --> 01:07:56.452
MATT: She breathes a sigh of relief. "That's been
largely my project as part of this entire

01:07:56.452 --> 01:08:11.999
"endeavor. All right, so when I was brought in
here, I was tasked to experiment with the design

01:08:11.999 --> 01:08:19.079
"and create large amounts of a very, very
delicately prepared acidic compound, one that

01:08:19.079 --> 01:08:27.598
"could dissolve the stone of your whitestone and
distill it down into pure residuum. This would allow

01:08:27.598 --> 01:08:35.824
"the bulk creation of a very powerful magical
essence for use in construction materials that we

01:08:35.824 --> 01:08:42.874
"could instill and use apparently for this
ziggurat, as well as other such things. Thus, that

01:08:42.874 --> 01:08:50.392
"was my main reason for being here. We were ahead
of schedule, and I completed the bulk of our

01:08:50.392 --> 01:08:55.380
"development weeks ago, and I no longer had much of
a purpose here."

01:08:55.380 --> 01:09:06.044
MARISHA: Ahead of schedule? I'm sorry. Hi. By the
way, I'm Keyleth. We haven't really talked yet.

01:09:06.044 --> 01:09:11.796
What schedule were you trying to keep? What was
the deadline?

01:09:11.796 --> 01:09:17.019
MATT: "We were trying to create enough continuous
acid to develop enough residuum to be used in the

01:09:17.019 --> 01:09:21.758
"reconstruction of the ziggurat. Once I had
developed enough of the compound to where we no

01:09:21.758 --> 01:09:28.460
"longer had to create more, my purpose was
complete. I had no interest beyond that. The rest

01:09:28.460 --> 01:09:30.647
"is gibberish to me."

01:09:30.647 --> 01:09:36.873
TALIESIN: So you're telling me that somewhere in this
castle there is a storage facility full of caustic

01:09:36.914 --> 01:09:40.721
acid that dissolves the very stones of this
castle?

01:09:40.721 --> 01:09:42.237
MATT: "Yes."

01:09:42.237 --> 01:09:46.931
SAM: I reach out and I take out my potion of acid
resistance and I drink it.

01:09:46.931 --> 01:09:49.413
(laughter)

01:09:49.457 --> 01:09:59.951
MATT: Okay. Mark that. She looks at you, goes,
"Yes. If you've seen the vents of greenish fume

01:09:59.951 --> 01:10:04.332
"billowing out in the garden, that is where the
distillery exhausts to."

01:10:04.332 --> 01:10:11.154
TALIESIN: Well, this is interesting.

01:10:11.154 --> 01:10:14.821
LAURA: Ziggurat? What's it for?

01:10:14.821 --> 01:10:16.718
MARISHA: What exactly does it do?

01:10:16.718 --> 01:10:20.030
SAM: Hurry up. Time is of the essence.

01:10:20.030 --> 01:10:28.519
MATT: "I don't know. It has something to do with
the Briarwoods' interest in some third party.

01:10:28.519 --> 01:10:33.023
"Someone they've been working with. Someone I've
not met, someone who I have no interest in

01:10:33.023 --> 01:10:34.307
"inquiring within."

01:10:34.307 --> 01:10:36.076
MARISHA: A name. Give us a name, girl.

01:10:36.076 --> 01:10:39.851
MATT: "I was not given a name. They don't speak of
this individual's name. They are very secretive

01:10:39.851 --> 01:10:43.979
"about it. They paid well, they gave me land, they
gave me a title, and when things were done, I was

01:10:43.979 --> 01:10:49.486
"to go free. Which is why I was not happy in which
the predicament you found me, made me."

01:10:49.486 --> 01:10:51.339
TRAVIS: Where can we find this ziggurat?

01:10:51.339 --> 01:11:00.842
MATT: Her eyes trail down to the floor. "The
ziggurat itself is, well, based on the tunneling

01:11:00.842 --> 01:11:07.140
"structure, the distillery's direction? Right
beneath the city of Whitestone."

01:11:07.140 --> 01:11:09.074
TRAVIS: The city or this castle?

01:11:09.074 --> 01:11:12.603
MARISHA: They're going to destroy this fucking
city.

01:11:12.603 --> 01:11:14.173
LAURA: Is it underneath the Sun Tree?

01:11:14.173 --> 01:11:18.732
MATT: "No, not the distillery. The ziggurat might
be."

01:11:18.732 --> 01:11:20.798
SAM: Wait, what?

01:11:20.798 --> 01:11:21.842
TALIESIN: Oh dear.

01:11:21.842 --> 01:11:24.445
MARISHA: They're going to-- yeah.

01:11:24.445 --> 01:11:30.245
TALIESIN: Are they still melting down the
whitestone for magical energy?

01:11:30.245 --> 01:11:38.771
MATT: "No, I don't believe so, not for weeks. We
finished that process for quite a bit now."

01:11:38.771 --> 01:11:42.999
MARISHA: So you're done melting the whitestone,
but you still have a whole bunch of this acidic

01:11:42.999 --> 01:11:45.049
compound kicking it in a warehouse somewhere?

01:11:45.049 --> 01:11:49.470
MATT: "Well, not in a warehouse. That's all kept
stored underneath the garden of the castle."

01:11:49.470 --> 01:11:53.670
TRAVIS: We need to finish clearing this house now.
I don't know if they're even here.

01:11:53.670 --> 01:11:54.767
TALIESIN: We'd better move.

01:11:54.767 --> 01:11:56.494
SAM: Downstairs.

01:11:56.494 --> 01:11:57.589
TALIESIN: Downstairs.

01:11:57.589 --> 01:12:01.689
MATT: "You were asking about Anders, though. Do
you wish to pay him a visit?"

01:12:01.689 --> 01:12:03.894
TALIESIN: (growls)

01:12:03.894 --> 01:12:06.479
MATT: You can see a smile on her face. She does
not like Anders.

01:12:06.479 --> 01:12:11.893
MARISHA: She's trying-- Percy? Percy, she's trying
to bait you. She's trying to waste time right now.

01:12:11.893 --> 01:12:12.674
Come on.

01:12:12.674 --> 01:12:14.243
MATT: "He was your sister's keeper."

01:12:14.243 --> 01:12:17.645
MARISHA: She's trying to-- Percy, la la la. Percy,
come on.

01:12:17.645 --> 01:12:19.854
LAURA: He's probably with the Briarwoods.

01:12:19.854 --> 01:12:21.580
MARISHA: Come on, he's not there.

01:12:21.580 --> 01:12:24.894
LIAM: I'm off sitting in the shadows, but I say,
Percival, we need to cut off the head.

01:12:24.935 --> 01:12:27.427
TALIESIN: Is it possible that my sister would be
with him?

01:12:27.427 --> 01:12:29.346
MATT: "It's very possible if she's not here."

01:12:29.346 --> 01:12:33.740
LAURA: Anna, shut. Up.

01:12:33.740 --> 01:12:34.851
MATT: "Very well."

01:12:34.851 --> 01:12:35.683
LAURA: Percival.

01:12:35.683 --> 01:12:37.622
MATT: "I only say because my whole--"

01:12:37.622 --> 01:12:43.411
LAURA: "Anna!" And I notch an arrow and aim it
right at her throat. "Shut. Up."

01:12:43.411 --> 01:12:45.225
MARISHA: Percy?

01:12:45.225 --> 01:12:49.403
SAM: Where would this professor be?

01:12:49.403 --> 01:12:52.630
MATT: "I imagine his study. It's around the
corner."

01:12:52.681 --> 01:12:55.639
TALIESIN: We'll check his study, and then we'll
go.

01:12:55.639 --> 01:12:56.744
MARISHA: No!

01:12:56.744 --> 01:12:58.146
TALIESIN: Just his study, then we'll go.

01:12:58.146 --> 01:12:59.013
MARISHA: Percy!

01:12:59.013 --> 01:13:01.462
TALIESIN: Even if he's there, if she's not there,
we'll leave.

01:13:01.462 --> 01:13:02.771
TRAVIS: Go. Lead the way.

01:13:02.771 --> 01:13:05.133
MARISHA: We're running out of time.

01:13:05.133 --> 01:13:06.816
LAURA: Brother, run and check the study.

01:13:06.816 --> 01:13:10.341
LIAM: I start running towards the direction that
was described.

01:13:10.341 --> 01:13:11.996
LAURA: Let's go towards the under--

01:13:11.996 --> 01:13:13.289
TALIESIN: Very well.

01:13:13.289 --> 01:13:15.084
LAURA: Lead the way down.

01:13:15.084 --> 01:13:17.262
MATT: "Very well."

01:13:17.262 --> 01:13:19.143
LAURA: No talking.

01:13:19.143 --> 01:13:20.693
SAM: Wait, we're going down?

01:13:20.693 --> 01:13:22.835
TRAVIS: Yeah, we're not leaving Vax.

01:13:22.835 --> 01:13:25.182
LAURA: We're heading down. He's going to catch
up.

01:13:25.182 --> 01:13:32.640
MATT: She begins making her way towards the
landing that leads to the stairway down, whereas

01:13:32.640 --> 01:13:37.644
you stealth off in that direction. You find your
way around that corner. Go ahead and roll perception.

01:13:37.675 --> 01:13:43.412
LIAM: As I'm moving, by the way, it's minor, but I
take out Clarota's (sniffs, groans) metallic cap

01:13:43.412 --> 01:13:50.469
and put it on, and I also whip out this other
cloak that I've been looking at and whip it

01:13:50.469 --> 01:13:52.860
around. You're not here. And now continue on.

01:13:52.860 --> 01:13:54.774
MATT: All right. So both will attune to you at
your next short rest.

01:13:54.774 --> 01:13:56.583
LIAM: Yes, all right, excellent. It's fine.

01:13:56.583 --> 01:13:59.481
LAURA: Well, you've worn Clarota's thing before.

01:13:59.481 --> 01:14:03.232
LIAM: There's two things. Moving forward.

01:14:03.232 --> 01:14:05.604
MATT: All right, make a perception check.

01:14:05.604 --> 01:14:09.421
LIAM: That is 22.

01:14:09.421 --> 01:14:15.908
MATT: All right, as you make your way down the
hallway, you hear what sounds like a muffled

01:14:15.908 --> 01:14:23.603
female voice from behind a distant doorway. Like a
small cry in pain or worry.

01:14:23.603 --> 01:14:26.966
LIAM: Do I need to stealth again, or am I already
stealthed?

01:14:26.966 --> 01:14:29.655
MATT: You rolled stealth before this.

01:14:29.655 --> 01:14:31.382
LIAM: Yeah. It was like 23 before.

01:14:31.382 --> 01:14:32.409
MATT: Yeah.

01:14:32.409 --> 01:14:35.027
LIAM: So I'm going to move toward that sound.
Carefully.

01:14:35.027 --> 01:14:41.445
MATT: Okay. It leads down. There are three
doorways on this side of the hallway. The central

01:14:41.445 --> 01:14:46.284
door there is where you hear the noise coming
from.

01:14:46.284 --> 01:14:52.883
LIAM: Okay, I'm sticking my ear to the door, and
I'm going to listen for a full minute to see what

01:14:52.883 --> 01:14:54.035
I hear.

01:14:54.035 --> 01:14:59.835
MATT: You hear a little bit of quiet and a light
sobbing. Then you hear another voice, a male voice,

01:14:59.883 --> 01:15:05.806
an older voice, just say quickly, "Shh! You be
quiet until you're told to speak.

01:15:05.806 --> 01:15:08.659
"They should be close."

01:15:08.659 --> 01:15:13.963
LIAM: I want to gently try the door handle.

01:15:13.963 --> 01:15:19.045
MATT: Okay. It is not locked. It does turn.

01:15:19.045 --> 01:15:24.077
LIAM: I want to push it like one inch in and try
to peek in.

01:15:24.077 --> 01:15:25.521
SAM: Just the tip.

01:15:25.521 --> 01:15:26.778
LAURA: Don't.

01:15:26.778 --> 01:15:28.269
MARISHA: I'm having deja vu.

01:15:28.269 --> 01:15:29.962
LAURA: I know. We've been here before.

01:15:29.962 --> 01:15:35.282
MATT: You glance inside the room, and it's a nice
study, and there is a fireplace on one side that

01:15:35.282 --> 01:15:40.309
is part of a continuation of a two-story fireplace
column that goes up through the castle on this

01:15:40.309 --> 01:15:44.240
side. There are shelves of books, there is a desk
in the far corner, there's a couple of chairs

01:15:44.240 --> 01:15:50.390
laying around. From this side, from what you can
see, in the center to the back of the room is an

01:15:50.390 --> 01:15:59.869
older gentleman wearing a breastplate. You can see
his very short gray hair, a little bit of facial

01:15:59.869 --> 01:16:03.831
hair that's grown in but not to a full beard. It
looks like it's been left to go on its own for a

01:16:03.831 --> 01:16:09.834
little while. And he's currently holding a young
woman, roughly early twenties or so with dark

01:16:09.834 --> 01:16:15.297
brown hair with a couple streaks of white through
the sides of the temple. Holding her by her hair

01:16:15.297 --> 01:16:26.419
with a dagger to her throat, saying, "Shh! Now.
When I tell you, you'll say what I told you to

01:16:26.419 --> 01:16:31.361
"say. Got it?"

01:16:31.361 --> 01:16:34.613
And you can see she has tears streaking down her
face she's like (gasping).

01:16:34.613 --> 01:16:44.407
LIAM: I back up about five steps and very quietly
say, Jenga.

01:16:44.407 --> 01:16:47.428
(laughter)

01:16:47.428 --> 01:16:51.810
LIAM: And I run at the door and I kick it open and
throw at him.

01:16:51.810 --> 01:16:53.099
SAM: Yeah!

01:16:53.099 --> 01:16:59.314
TALIESIN: Well, that happened.

01:16:59.314 --> 01:17:00.568
SAM: Yeah.

01:17:00.568 --> 01:17:02.194
MATT: All righty.

01:17:02.194 --> 01:17:03.484
LAURA: So we take off running towards him.

01:17:03.484 --> 01:17:11.432
MARISHA: Here we go. Jenga. Fucking asshole.

01:17:11.432 --> 01:17:13.454
(laughter)

01:17:13.454 --> 01:17:14.664
TALIESIN: Dick!

01:17:14.664 --> 01:17:16.402
MARISHA: It's a trap. It's such a trap.

01:17:16.402 --> 01:17:17.551
SAM: Of course.

01:17:17.551 --> 01:17:23.619
MATT: All right. (laughs) So you have a surprise
round.

01:17:23.619 --> 01:17:24.931
LIAM: Yeah.

01:17:24.931 --> 01:17:26.697
MARISHA: Come on, Sneak Attack.

01:17:26.697 --> 01:17:31.177
MATT: Both those individuals right there. Go ahead
and make your attack.

01:17:31.177 --> 01:17:33.626
LIAM: What am I looking at?

01:17:33.626 --> 01:17:37.065
MATT: Okay, so as you burst in. You can see the
man's holding, there's the desk behind him, right

01:17:37.065 --> 01:17:41.346
there. Papers and stuff scattered on there.
There's some tables around with some chairs. There

01:17:41.346 --> 01:17:45.594
are these large bookshelves that hold this side
and there's the fireplace in the far corner right

01:17:45.594 --> 01:17:51.249
there. Flames. Warming the room. There's a small
chandelier on the ceiling that has magical light

01:17:51.249 --> 01:17:56.481
emanating from it that gives the room this warm
glow. You don't care right now because you're

01:17:56.481 --> 01:17:58.040
throwing a fucking dagger.

01:17:58.040 --> 01:17:59.823
LIAM: Right. But he's behind her a bit, right?

01:17:59.823 --> 01:18:01.769
MATT: Yeah, he's holding her right there with a
dagger to her throat.

01:18:01.769 --> 01:18:07.224
LIAM: Well, I recently added the sharpshooter
feat, so three-quarter and half cover means

01:18:07.224 --> 01:18:12.646
nothing to me. So I'm going to aim for his eye
that's peeking out the side. All three are

01:18:12.646 --> 01:18:14.784
going right in his eye.

01:18:14.784 --> 01:18:16.057
MATT: Okay.

01:18:16.057 --> 01:18:20.609
LIAM: So here's the first. The first is 24.

01:18:20.609 --> 01:18:22.844
MATT: That'll hit.

01:18:22.844 --> 01:18:29.033
LIAM: Okay, the second is 26. As you can tell,
I've been screaming monster sounds. My voice is a

01:18:29.033 --> 01:18:30.637
little ragged. 26 on the second.

01:18:30.637 --> 01:18:32.345
MATT: Hits.

01:18:32.345 --> 01:18:34.568
LIAM: And 16 on the third.

01:18:34.568 --> 01:18:38.743
MATT: 16 misses. But the first two strike true.

01:18:38.743 --> 01:18:52.277
LIAM: The first, it's three plus seven is ten.
Plus 14, 20, 26, 29, 33, 39. That's the first one.

01:18:52.277 --> 01:19:01.029
And then the second one does four plus six is ten.
Oh! But it's surprise, so the first one is doubled

01:19:01.029 --> 01:19:02.712
because it's automatically a crit.

01:19:02.712 --> 01:19:06.367
MATT: All right, so what's that now?

01:19:06.367 --> 01:19:14.043
LIAM: Well, it was 39, so now it's 60, 78. For the
first one. Ten for the second.

01:19:14.043 --> 01:19:15.393
TALIESIN: I love you.

01:19:15.393 --> 01:19:21.214
MATT: Okay. So 88 points of damage. You just went
80 miles per hour on your first turn. As you kick

01:19:21.214 --> 01:19:27.416
the doors open. (whoosh) The first dagger, he sees
it coming towards him for a second and attempts to

01:19:27.416 --> 01:19:31.253
dodge out of the way, and as he moves this eye out
of the way, the dagger (impact noise) right into

01:19:31.253 --> 01:19:37.356
this one, he screams out (screaming) in pain as it
just plunges into his eye socket. Not deep enough

01:19:37.356 --> 01:19:41.896
to actually hit any brain, but enough to
definitely take that eye out as any sort of viable

01:19:41.896 --> 01:19:48.142
method. The second one just hits him in the
shoulder and a reaction to that, Cassandra screams

01:19:48.142 --> 01:19:54.788
out, "No, run! It's a trap!" At which point, he
takes his dagger and just

01:19:54.788 --> 01:19:56.508
runs it across her throat.

01:19:56.508 --> 01:19:59.375
LAURA: (softly) I don't think it's her. 
It's not her.

01:19:59.375 --> 01:20:04.661
MATT: You see crimson start to pour down the front
as she (choking). Go ahead and roll initiative.

01:20:04.661 --> 01:20:14.544
LIAM: All right. I'm going to do luck. Yeah.
That's a 22.

01:20:14.544 --> 01:20:16.595
TALIESIN: Why would she be saying it's a trap if
it's not her?

01:20:16.595 --> 01:20:18.048
LAURA: Could be a peasant.

01:20:18.048 --> 01:20:28.617
MATT: All right. Okay. So you're going first.
Also, at this point as you throw the dagger,

01:20:28.617 --> 01:20:35.618
you're still at the doorway and you hear what
sounds like two sources of metal clanking

01:20:35.618 --> 01:20:42.716
together. You can't really see a source, but you
hear other sounds in the room. What are you doing

01:20:42.716 --> 01:20:44.084
with your action?

01:20:47.684 --> 01:20:55.343
LIAM: I am running at him and stabbing the shit
out of him.

01:20:55.343 --> 01:21:03.481
MATT: Okay, as you cross this boundary, I need you
to go ahead and immediately make a constitution

01:21:03.481 --> 01:21:04.712
saving throw.

01:21:04.712 --> 01:21:09.659
LIAM: I'll use luck again. Yeah.

01:21:09.659 --> 01:21:11.342
SAM: That's two lucks.

01:21:11.342 --> 01:21:14.251
LIAM: That's 17 for constitution saving throw.

01:21:14.251 --> 01:21:18.912
MATT: Great. All right, so as you step across the
threshold of the room, the tile in front of you

01:21:18.912 --> 01:21:23.751
all of a sudden bursts in a flash of blue,
painfully cold energy, like there's a concentrated

01:21:23.751 --> 01:21:26.060
moment of shredding ice.

01:21:26.060 --> 01:21:28.589
LIAM: Am I able to use evasion for that?

01:21:28.589 --> 01:21:30.005
MATT: You can, technically.

01:21:30.005 --> 01:21:31.567
LIAM: So if I succeed, I take no damage.

01:21:31.567 --> 01:21:37.396
MATT: Correct. Okay, so you take no damage. You
dart across, just managing to use that momentum

01:21:37.396 --> 01:21:41.429
and your intensity toward this horrible moment
that just happened before you. And you feel the

01:21:41.429 --> 01:21:45.964
explosion happen behind you. You just manage to
pass beyond it. You rush forward to him. All

01:21:45.964 --> 01:21:52.393
right. And he's dropped her to the ground now.
She's fallen onto her hands and knees.

01:21:52.393 --> 01:21:55.195
LIAM: I'm going into his guts.

01:21:55.195 --> 01:21:56.370
MATT: Okay.

01:21:56.370 --> 01:22:04.311
LIAM: So first attack is a 25, second attack is a
20, and the third attack is a 26.

01:22:04.311 --> 01:22:06.823
One, two, three?

01:22:06.823 --> 01:22:08.268
MATT: One, two, three.

01:22:08.268 --> 01:22:11.687
LIAM: Oh, and I'm going to turn the poison on for
the poison dagger, which I'm going to use for the

01:22:11.687 --> 01:22:12.774
second.

01:22:12.774 --> 01:22:14.813
LAURA: Just flip the little switch.

01:22:14.813 --> 01:22:27.204
LIAM: Well, it just drips. So nine for the first,
eight for the second, plus the poison is-- shit, I

01:22:27.204 --> 01:22:32.402
didn't copy it down here. I think it's 1d12. Let's
say it's 1d12, because I can't remember. If anyone

01:22:32.402 --> 01:22:39.569
wants to correct me, they can. Five points of
poison added to the five is 13. And then the last

01:22:39.569 --> 01:22:43.077
dagger is nine.

01:22:43.077 --> 01:22:48.631
MATT: Okay. So as you rush up to him and shank him
repeatedly in the side, the breastplates

01:22:48.631 --> 01:22:52.330
deflecting part of the blow, but you're managing
to find openings in the side, and you go for a

01:22:52.330 --> 01:22:56.390
shoulder and jam it underneath his arm, through
his ribcage, and he screams out (yelps) in pain,

01:22:56.390 --> 01:23:02.123
and you can see there's blood pouring out the
side of his mouth. And the dagger's returned by

01:23:02.123 --> 01:23:05.637
now, but there's this giant gaping, bleeding wound
on the side of his face where one of his eyes is

01:23:05.637 --> 01:23:12.446
completely ruined. He looks both surprised,
angered, and very, very confused about the way

01:23:12.446 --> 01:23:14.178
things suddenly happened.

01:23:14.178 --> 01:23:15.608
LIAM: Hello.

01:23:15.608 --> 01:23:19.732
MATT: All right so that's your turn.

01:23:19.732 --> 01:23:20.979
LIAM: That's it, I'm out.

01:23:20.979 --> 01:23:23.096
MATT: Okay, he's going to go.

01:23:23.096 --> 01:23:27.720
TALIESIN: Goddamn it.

01:23:30.810 --> 01:23:33.384
LIAM: We're six seconds in, Taliesin.

01:23:33.384 --> 01:23:40.015
MATT: First off, there were two sets of
decorative armor on the sides of the wall that

01:23:40.015 --> 01:23:45.225
suddenly have filled with some sort of reddish
arcane energy that gives them a solid physical

01:23:45.225 --> 01:23:49.383
form, and they both step off their pedestals and
begin (heavy impact) making their way towards you.

01:23:49.383 --> 01:23:53.284
But before all that happens, Professor Anders in
front of you, wounded and not looking terribly

01:23:53.284 --> 01:24:04.632
happy at the moment, is going to use his action to
attempt to cast Confusion on you. So he goes to

01:24:04.632 --> 01:24:12.509
step back, and (grunting) just releases his hand
in front of you as one functioning eye bores into

01:24:12.509 --> 01:24:17.403
you as he screams out. You can feel the pressure
towards your head. Go ahead and make a wisdom

01:24:17.403 --> 01:24:18.799
saving throw.

01:24:18.799 --> 01:24:21.085
LIAM: Wisdom, which I have advantage.

01:24:21.085 --> 01:24:23.560
MATT: Well, wisdom saving throw because of that
anyway, so.

01:24:23.560 --> 01:24:25.446
LIAM: That is a 20.

01:24:25.446 --> 01:24:32.242
MATT: A 20? The effect shrugs off. Nothing on you.
He is going to attempt to step back--

01:24:32.242 --> 01:24:33.726
LIAM: Oh, attack him.

01:24:33.726 --> 01:24:35.505
MATT: So you get attack of opportunity on him.

01:24:35.505 --> 01:24:38.433
LIAM: Yeah, it's a 22.

01:24:38.433 --> 01:24:40.206
MATT: 22? Okay, that does hit.

01:24:40.206 --> 01:24:42.446
LIAM: Eight.

01:24:42.446 --> 01:24:55.361
MATT: Okay. He will use his bonus action and he--
let me look up the definition of it real fast.

01:24:55.361 --> 01:25:02.223
Okay, takes a bonus action as he steps back,
"(grunts) Come. Take this inspiration to defeat my

01:25:02.223 --> 01:25:10.295
foe!" And he lends an inspiration dice to one of
the armored creatures stepping forward towards

01:25:10.295 --> 01:25:19.236
you. Now it's their turn. Both these armored
creatures pull out swords, and they lift up the

01:25:19.236 --> 01:25:26.372
shields that they had to their sides, and they
rush into you from two sides right there. You see

01:25:26.372 --> 01:25:30.414
this as they rush up to you: they're not really
touching the ground, they're gliding across it. So

01:25:30.414 --> 01:25:41.275
the first one is going to attempt to strike you
with two attacks of its longsword. That is a 14?

01:25:41.275 --> 01:25:42.370
LIAM: No.

01:25:42.370 --> 01:25:44.811
MATT: Second one is a 17.

01:25:44.811 --> 01:25:45.885
LIAM: No.

01:25:45.885 --> 01:25:51.970
MATT: All right. The second one now is going to go
ahead and take two swings at you. That is an 18.

01:25:51.970 --> 01:25:54.595
LIAM: Yeah, but I'll use uncanny dodge.

01:25:54.595 --> 01:25:55.814
MATT: To reduce the damage by half?

01:25:55.814 --> 01:25:56.479
LIAM: Yeah.

01:25:56.479 --> 01:26:03.563
MATT: Okay, so the first strike hits you for 13
points of slashing damage.

01:26:03.563 --> 01:26:06.219
LIAM: So, half that or all of that?

01:26:06.219 --> 01:26:07.335
MATT: That'll be half that.

01:26:07.335 --> 01:26:08.794
LIAM: Half that. Okay, so seven.

01:26:08.794 --> 01:26:12.315
MATT: There you go. And then that's going to be a
24 to hit.

01:26:12.315 --> 01:26:14.277
LIAM: That hits, yeah.

01:26:14.277 --> 01:26:22.004
MATT: And this is not halved. Okay, that's 12
points of slashing damage.

01:26:22.004 --> 01:26:24.239
LIAM: All right.

01:26:24.239 --> 01:26:36.216
MATT: Okay, now to Cassandra's turn. She is on the
ground just spilling out her life essence onto the

01:26:36.216 --> 01:26:39.273
ground. She's clutching at her throat and is like
(gasping). You hear that horrible sucking sound of

01:26:39.273 --> 01:26:50.705
her feeling her life drain from her. She's not
unconscious, but she doesn't have long for this

01:26:50.705 --> 01:26:55.394
world. All right, that brings us to the top of the
round. The rest of you guys are now rushing, I

01:26:55.394 --> 01:27:01.004
assume, dash motion, making your way as fast as
you can to that side. Due to distance, you would

01:27:01.004 --> 01:27:04.997
all get to the end of this hallway, about there.

01:27:08.927 --> 01:27:11.155
TALIESIN: Is that including sprint?

01:27:11.155 --> 01:27:14.343
MATT: Well, the dash action, yeah.

01:27:14.343 --> 01:27:15.862
TALIESIN: That's full dash?

01:27:15.862 --> 01:27:18.766
MATT: This is your movement and then dash action,
you guys, because you guys were down in this area,

01:27:18.766 --> 01:27:25.718
heading down the stairs. You just made it up and
over. And this is Ripley. We'll use that for

01:27:25.718 --> 01:27:34.930
Ripley for now. Everyone else roll initiative.
We're in a new combat round.

01:27:34.930 --> 01:27:36.925
TALIESIN: What the hell!?

01:27:36.925 --> 01:27:40.247
MARISHA: Oh! Percy's pissed.

01:27:40.247 --> 01:27:41.691
TALIESIN: I Percy'd again.

01:27:41.691 --> 01:27:42.584
MARISHA: He Percy'd.

01:27:42.584 --> 01:27:44.158
MATT: Who got him that dice?

01:27:44.158 --> 01:27:46.071
(laughter)

01:27:46.071 --> 01:27:47.781
TRAVIS: The golden snitch is powerful.

01:27:47.781 --> 01:27:53.613
TALIESIN: No, I was on Group Hug last week with
somebody else's dice, and it was comedy.

01:27:53.613 --> 01:27:54.893
LAURA: It's just you, Taliesin.

01:27:54.893 --> 01:27:57.397
TALIESIN: Thank you.

01:27:57.397 --> 01:27:58.664
MATT: You are the anti-Wheaton.

01:27:58.664 --> 01:28:00.200
TALIESIN: I'm the anti-Wheaton.

01:28:00.200 --> 01:28:04.207
MATT: If you guys were to play in the same group,
all RPGs would fold into themselves and no longer

01:28:04.207 --> 01:28:10.533
exist. It's like the end of Timecop. It'll be
terrible. Okay, so initiatives. We have 25 to 20?

01:28:10.533 --> 01:28:11.593
TALIESIN: 28.

01:28:11.593 --> 01:28:12.659
MATT: 28.

01:28:12.659 --> 01:28:13.656
TRAVIS: 21.

01:28:13.656 --> 01:28:15.590
MATT: 21. Remember your advantage, by the way.

01:28:15.590 --> 01:28:16.826
TRAVIS: That's the second roll.

01:28:16.826 --> 01:28:19.800
MATT: All right, so Percy at the top.

01:28:19.800 --> 01:28:22.004
TRAVIS: Feral instinct.

01:28:22.004 --> 01:28:24.936
MATT: All right, and you were at-- I think your
initiative was 20?

01:28:24.936 --> 01:28:27.974
LIAM: I don't remember. It was early 20s.

01:28:27.974 --> 01:28:33.839
MATT: Early 20s, yeah, so it'd be Percy, Vax. 20
to 15?

01:28:33.839 --> 01:28:34.756
MARISHA: 13.

01:28:34.756 --> 01:28:35.870
SAM: 19.

01:28:35.870 --> 01:28:37.027
MATT: 19.

01:28:37.027 --> 01:28:46.399
MARISHA: Oh wait, sorry. Might have jumped the gun
a bit there. I'm excited. Sorry. I'm bringing up

01:28:46.399 --> 01:28:48.884
the ranks anyway, I think. It's fine.

01:28:56.124 --> 01:29:00.098
MATT: Keyleth, all right. Vex, what'd you get?

01:29:00.098 --> 01:29:01.147
LAURA: 11.

01:29:01.147 --> 01:29:02.009
MATT: 11.

01:29:02.009 --> 01:29:03.017
LIAM: I'm Vax.

01:29:03.017 --> 01:29:06.945
MATT: I know, I said Vex! I got it right this
time!

01:29:06.945 --> 01:29:07.943
LIAM: Oh, you're from California.

01:29:07.943 --> 01:29:11.281
LAURA: Yeah. (laughing)

01:29:11.281 --> 01:29:21.081
MATT: Technically, I'm from Florida. All right, so
Percy, you're up first.

01:29:21.081 --> 01:29:24.693
TALIESIN: Can I drag Ripley with me?

01:29:24.693 --> 01:29:27.374
MATT: You can, but you'll be moving half
movement.

01:29:27.374 --> 01:29:28.294
TALIESIN: Fuck.

01:29:28.294 --> 01:29:31.020
TRAVIS: Leave her. Somebody else--

01:29:31.020 --> 01:29:39.978
TALIESIN: So as my bonus action before anything
happens I'm going to tell her, she lives, you

01:29:40.078 --> 01:29:46.320
show us where the entrance to the caverns are, you
walk with your things. And run.

01:29:46.320 --> 01:29:51.797
LAURA: She was trying to set us up in this trap.
You do understand that?

01:29:51.797 --> 01:29:53.343
MARISHA: Oh yeah, she's all about this fucking
shit.

01:29:53.343 --> 01:29:54.167
MATT: Full movement?

01:29:54.167 --> 01:29:55.106
TALIESIN: Full movement.

01:29:55.106 --> 01:29:59.895
MATT: Okay, that's your full turn there. All
right, that ends your turn, Percy.

01:29:59.895 --> 01:30:04.691
LIAM: I have one healing potion left, and I'm
going to take it and stick it into this girl's

01:30:04.691 --> 01:30:08.709
mouth and empty it and maybe drip a little on her
neck as well.

01:30:08.709 --> 01:30:10.379
MATT: Okay, go for it.

01:30:10.379 --> 01:30:12.585
MARISHA: Maybe hold her neck. Make sure it goes
down.

01:30:12.585 --> 01:30:19.633
MATT: Well, you have to roll to heal. You pull
back, and it's a really unsettling thing as you

01:30:19.633 --> 01:30:21.826
pull up her head to try and feed her the potion.

01:30:21.826 --> 01:30:25.379
LIAM: It's 2d4?

01:30:25.379 --> 01:30:26.890
MATT: It's just a regular healing potion?

01:30:26.890 --> 01:30:32.309
LIAM: Yeah, regular. It's the lowest of the rung.
Moderate? I think it's called moderate?

01:30:32.309 --> 01:30:34.649
MATT: Sorry, got it right here. That's 2d4 plus
two.

01:30:34.649 --> 01:30:46.966
LIAM: So four. Six. And then I want to step in
front of her, between her and that one, and then

01:30:47.016 --> 01:30:48.217
stab the one.

01:30:48.217 --> 01:30:51.860
MATT: Okay, as you take the potion, it's a messy
process. You get most of it in her, but some of it

01:30:51.860 --> 01:30:59.240
drips on the ground, but the wound seems to close.
All the blood goes away on the ground around her

01:30:59.240 --> 01:31:02.699
neck from the splashing of the potion, which has
vanished entirely, and you can see she's

01:31:02.699 --> 01:31:04.343
(gasping).

01:31:04.343 --> 01:31:05.674
LAURA: That's good.

01:31:05.674 --> 01:31:07.933
MATT: She's right on the edge, but she's looking
pretty rough.

01:31:07.933 --> 01:31:09.745
LIAM: So is that the bonus action, or is that the
action?

01:31:09.745 --> 01:31:10.873
MATT: That was your action.

01:31:10.873 --> 01:31:19.480
LIAM: Action, okay. By the way, I'm realizing I
didn't click my boots, so I did one two three

01:31:19.480 --> 01:31:24.263
before, and the third one missed, so luckily that
worked out, but I'm not clicking those.

01:31:24.263 --> 01:31:26.911
MATT: Thank you for the reminder. So used to
dagger, dagger, dagger. I'm like, "Wait, no."

01:31:26.911 --> 01:31:29.746
LIAM: So I just step between them, and that's all
I can do, yeah?

01:31:29.746 --> 01:31:33.246
MATT: Okay, so you move into there, great. That's
your turn.

01:31:33.246 --> 01:31:35.631
LIAM: No, I mean between her and the closest one
to her.

01:31:35.631 --> 01:31:38.773
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, we've got this new thing now.
That's so much better.

01:31:38.773 --> 01:31:45.577
MATT: For those who don't know, we have a top-down
camera for the players, which is really helpful

01:31:45.577 --> 01:31:46.682
for them to know--

01:31:46.682 --> 01:31:47.769
LAURA: What's going on.

01:31:47.769 --> 01:31:48.700
MATT: So you move.

01:31:48.700 --> 01:31:50.687
LIAM: I was hoping to stand in front of her, yeah.
Like that.

01:31:50.687 --> 01:31:54.524
MATT: So you push her aside and get in between the
two, okay. Cool, that ends your turn.

01:31:54.524 --> 01:31:56.136
Grog, you're up.

01:31:56.136 --> 01:31:57.350
TRAVIS: Dead sprint after Percy.

01:31:57.350 --> 01:31:58.575
MATT: Okay, and your speed is?

01:31:58.575 --> 01:31:59.580
TRAVIS: 50.

01:31:59.580 --> 01:32:01.882
LIAM and TALIESIN: (heavy footsteps)

01:32:01.882 --> 01:32:08.615
TALIESIN: Yeah!

01:32:08.615 --> 01:32:10.248
MARISHA: What's up, Grog?

01:32:10.248 --> 01:32:15.335
MATT: You can get all the way up into here, but
that's all you can do this turn. Yeah, so you're

01:32:15.335 --> 01:32:22.070
(heavy footsteps) bounding down the hall. You push
past Percy and rush into the room, and you see a

01:32:22.070 --> 01:32:30.022
young girl on the ground, doubled over, barely
conscious. You see Vax stepping in front of these

01:32:30.022 --> 01:32:36.911
weird, glowing armored creatures, and at the back
of the room, there's a man with bleeding, gaping

01:32:36.911 --> 01:32:38.237
eye socket.

01:32:38.237 --> 01:32:39.679
TRAVIS: What the fuck did you do?

01:32:39.679 --> 01:32:40.714
LIAM: Welcome to the party.

01:32:40.714 --> 01:32:42.177
MATT: All right. Scanlan, you're up.

01:32:42.177 --> 01:32:47.419
SAM: I'm up? I run as fast as my little legs will
take me. 25.

01:32:47.419 --> 01:32:48.824
MATT: There you go.

01:32:48.824 --> 01:32:59.950
SAM: I can't see them, so I'll just inspire--
Who's going to get in there next? Who's behind me?

01:32:59.950 --> 01:33:06.019
Can I inspire people that I can't see?

01:33:06.019 --> 01:33:08.319
MATT: I think they have to be in your sight.

01:33:08.319 --> 01:33:13.783
TALIESIN: You can see me, though whether or not
you want to inspire me at this point is definitely

01:33:13.783 --> 01:33:15.112
debatable.

01:33:15.544 --> 01:33:18.996
MATT: You can inspire somebody else in the hallway, if
you'd like.

01:33:18.996 --> 01:33:22.277
SAM: All right. They can't even make it in the
next turn, right?

01:33:22.277 --> 01:33:24.343
MARISHA: No, but we'll keep it.

01:33:24.343 --> 01:33:43.150
SAM: Sure. I will inspire Vex, behind me, and I'll
say, (sings) Arrows and bows, they fire at our

01:33:43.150 --> 01:33:50.398
foes and kill them, and they make them ghosts.
They won't let go.

01:33:50.398 --> 01:33:52.302
SAM and LAURA: (sing) Arrows and bows!

01:33:52.302 --> 01:34:01.442
MATT: As the beat hits you, you feel yourself a
little more sure shot with any arrows. Take your

01:34:01.442 --> 01:34:03.006
d10 inspiration die.

01:34:03.006 --> 01:34:07.014
LIAM: Forearms go (explosion noises).

01:34:07.014 --> 01:34:09.314
(laughter)

01:34:09.314 --> 01:34:20.611
MATT: All righty. So, that brings us to-- all
right. Professor Anders, now, is taking his turn.

01:34:20.611 --> 01:34:22.416
MARISHA: Professor Anders.

01:34:22.416 --> 01:34:24.443
SAM: Professor Anders.

01:34:24.443 --> 01:34:26.085
MARISHA: Professor Anders.

01:34:26.085 --> 01:34:29.813
LIAM: Mr. Anderson.

01:34:29.813 --> 01:34:35.793
MATT: He sees this giant creature in the room
looming and he reaches up and closes up one eye

01:34:35.793 --> 01:34:42.985
and goes, "You. Do this for me." And as he looks
at you for a second, he releases another spell and

01:34:42.985 --> 01:34:49.108
you feel a familiar arcane grasp begin to curl
over the back of your mind. Go ahead and roll a

01:34:49.108 --> 01:34:51.815
wisdom saving throw with advantage because of your
Heroes' Feast.

01:34:51.815 --> 01:34:53.553
TRAVIS: All right, okay.

01:34:53.553 --> 01:34:57.643
LIAM: Come on, baby. One more time.

01:34:57.643 --> 01:35:01.545
TRAVIS: 14.

01:35:01.545 --> 01:35:07.184
MATT: 14. Your brain, not tempered against these
types of magics and having previously failed you

01:35:07.184 --> 01:35:11.706
before. You feel your will no longer become your
own as now you are an instrument of destruction

01:35:11.706 --> 01:35:16.539
controlled by Professor Anders. You've been
Dominated.

01:35:16.539 --> 01:35:17.413
TALIESIN: Damn it!

01:35:17.413 --> 01:35:18.551
LAURA: Fuck!

01:35:18.551 --> 01:35:22.504
SAM: Oh no. Dominate goliath.

01:35:22.504 --> 01:35:24.478
LAURA: We've got to kill that motherfucker!

01:35:24.478 --> 01:35:34.296
MATT: Okay. I mean, he looks to you and goes,
"Kill that one!" And points to Vax, and you look

01:35:34.296 --> 01:35:38.505
down at Vax with a grin as the blood-letting
you've wanted so bad,

01:35:38.505 --> 01:35:39.959
your target lies before you.

01:35:39.959 --> 01:35:41.276
SAM: Hulk versus Wolverine!

01:35:41.276 --> 01:35:44.545
(laughter)

01:35:44.545 --> 01:35:45.790
MATT: Ending Anders's turn--

01:35:45.790 --> 01:35:48.298
TALIESIN: Remember what he did to your beard.

01:35:48.340 --> 01:35:51.554
TRAVIS: I know, is it me grinning, or is it
dominated Grog?

01:35:51.554 --> 01:35:53.553
(laughter)

01:35:53.553 --> 01:35:54.815
MATT: Moves to here.

01:35:54.815 --> 01:35:57.074
TALIESIN: Hulk versus Wolverine, man. I'm excited
by that.

01:35:57.074 --> 01:36:00.301
MATT: Both of these horrors move and shift around
now at this moment to get on each sides of you,

01:36:00.301 --> 01:36:07.077
giving them both a flanking bonus. Now it's four
strikes, longsword against you, with advantage.

01:36:07.077 --> 01:36:09.460
Double eights. Can't roll shit!

01:36:09.460 --> 01:36:12.607
LIAM: Why advantage? I'm just curious. Give it to
me, but what's the advantage from?

01:36:12.607 --> 01:36:15.196
MATT: They have advantage against you because they
moved into flanking position.

01:36:15.196 --> 01:36:16.305
LIAM: Because they're in flanking. Got it.

01:36:16.305 --> 01:36:22.611
MATT: Which, for those who're curious about it, it
is an optional rule in the DMG. It exists. Second

01:36:22.611 --> 01:36:25.580
attack. Three and a four. I can't roll!

01:36:25.580 --> 01:36:28.548
TALIESIN: (sucking sounds)

01:36:28.548 --> 01:36:30.516
MATT: So this guy just whiffs with both of his
weapon strikes.

01:36:30.516 --> 01:36:31.857
MARISHA: You're sucking his energy?

01:36:31.857 --> 01:36:33.349
TALIESIN: (raspy) I have your power.

01:36:33.349 --> 01:36:35.653
MATT: Natural 20 on the next strike.

01:36:35.653 --> 01:36:37.704
LAURA and MARISHA: Spoke too soon.

01:36:37.704 --> 01:36:38.944
MATT: Two natural 20s.

01:36:38.944 --> 01:36:40.195
TALIESIN: Damn it!

01:36:40.195 --> 01:36:44.816
MATT: It was a miss and a natural 20 on the first
attack, and then a natural 20 on the first roll of

01:36:44.816 --> 01:36:45.680
the second attack.

01:36:45.680 --> 01:36:46.980
TALIESIN: Goddamn it. I'm sorry.

01:36:46.980 --> 01:36:47.939
MARISHA: Spoke too soon.

01:36:47.939 --> 01:36:49.569
MATT: So you take on the first hit--

01:36:49.569 --> 01:36:51.965
MARISHA: You mock fate, fate punches you in the
mouth.

01:36:51.965 --> 01:37:02.644
MATT: That would be 16 points of slashing damage,
and 20 points of slashing damage with the second

01:37:02.644 --> 01:37:08.269
strike, so a total of 36 points of slashing
damage. And you can feel this strange, angry

01:37:08.269 --> 01:37:14.652
vibrating growl coming from within this unhallowed
armor that floats before you. That ends their go.

01:37:14.652 --> 01:37:16.112
Keyleth, you're up.

01:37:16.112 --> 01:37:22.730
MARISHA: I'm running like hell. Running, running,
running. Can I see? Can I peek around the corner

01:37:22.730 --> 01:37:23.710
just to see?

01:37:23.710 --> 01:37:25.602
MATT: You can just peek around the corner and see
the circumstance.

01:37:25.602 --> 01:37:26.651
MARISHA: Can I see Cassandra?

01:37:26.651 --> 01:37:27.723
MATT: You do, yes.

01:37:27.723 --> 01:37:28.855
MARISHA: Healing Word.

01:37:28.855 --> 01:37:30.184
MATT: Okay, go ahead and roll.

01:37:30.184 --> 01:37:31.204
SAM: Do you know it's her?

01:37:31.204 --> 01:37:32.379
TALIESIN: Yeah.

01:37:32.379 --> 01:37:33.724
LAURA: Either way. Whoever it is.

01:37:33.724 --> 01:37:34.874
SAM: Do you know what she looks like?

01:37:34.874 --> 01:37:35.846
TRAVIS: Just do what you're going to do.

01:37:35.846 --> 01:37:36.844
LAURA: Just do it.

01:37:36.844 --> 01:37:37.585
SAM: Okay.

01:37:37.585 --> 01:37:38.503
MARISHA: Healing Word.

01:37:38.503 --> 01:37:39.403
TALIESIN: Family resemblance.

01:37:39.403 --> 01:37:40.251
MARISHA: Family resemblance.

01:37:40.251 --> 01:37:45.378
MATT: I'd say given the circumstances, you have an
inkling that someone's in danger there. And the

01:37:45.378 --> 01:37:47.194
calling of Jenga. So go for it.

01:37:47.194 --> 01:37:53.655
MARISHA: I'll cast it-- no, I'm just going to keep
it at 1st level for now. I'm going to save my

01:37:53.655 --> 01:38:04.371
higher-level ones for Cure Wounds, so I'm going to
cast it at 1st level, so that's 1d4 plus my

01:38:04.371 --> 01:38:11.898
spellcaster. Three. That's not too bad. No, sorry.
16? No, 13.

01:38:11.898 --> 01:38:16.907
MATT: 13? Okay, good to know. All righty. That's
your turn. Vex, you're up.

01:38:16.907 --> 01:38:26.859
LAURA: So I'm with Anna. Trinket-- I tell him to
hold onto her and drag her along with us.

01:38:26.859 --> 01:38:28.210
MATT: Okay.

01:38:28.210 --> 01:38:30.389
LAURA: So he clamps down on her arm.

01:38:30.389 --> 01:38:34.405
MATT: So one, two. He's going to attempt to
grapple her. Go ahead and roll an athletics check

01:38:34.405 --> 01:38:39.498
with advantage because she's not expecting it.

01:38:39.498 --> 01:38:44.280
LAURA: 16?

01:38:44.280 --> 01:38:50.517
MATT: Okay. Trinket grabs onto the scruff of her
coat and begins pushing forward. They both get the

01:38:50.517 --> 01:38:53.665
rest of half of his movement because he's forcing
her forward. That's as far as he can get.

01:38:53.665 --> 01:38:55.732
LAURA: But I can keep running? I can run all the
way up?

01:38:55.732 --> 01:38:57.892
MATT: What's your speed? Is it 30?

01:38:57.892 --> 01:38:58.926
LAURA: 30.

01:38:58.926 --> 01:39:05.141
MATT: You get about there, right at the edge.

01:39:05.141 --> 01:39:06.451
LAURA: So I can shoot an arrow?

01:39:06.451 --> 01:39:09.645
MATT: No, that's your movement and then your dash
action to get there.

01:39:09.645 --> 01:39:10.659
LAURA: Okay, cool.

01:39:10.659 --> 01:39:22.751
MATT: All right. Ripley is just going to stay put
for the time being. She's held by a bear and being

01:39:22.751 --> 01:39:24.620
pushed along. She's just "Ugh."

01:39:24.620 --> 01:39:25.911
TALIESIN: With no weapons and no armor.

01:39:25.911 --> 01:39:27.474
MATT: Leather armor, basically.

01:39:27.474 --> 01:39:28.490
TALIESIN: Leather armor, yeah.

01:39:28.490 --> 01:39:31.456
MATT: Percy, you're up.

01:39:31.456 --> 01:39:38.606
TALIESIN: I'm going to run in. I can move six,
right?

01:39:38.606 --> 01:39:40.827
MATT: You can move six squares, yes.

01:39:40.827 --> 01:39:48.393
TALIESIN: One, two. Can I get a good view of
Professor Anders and maybe get a little cover from

01:39:48.393 --> 01:39:49.596
the dining room table?

01:39:49.596 --> 01:39:51.087
MATT: You can a little bit, yeah.

01:39:51.087 --> 01:39:55.589
TALIESIN: All right, I'll take my cover. I'm going
to pull out--

01:39:55.589 --> 01:39:59.711
MATT: As you walk in, around the corner you can
see these armor attacking Grog, his axe forward at

01:39:59.711 --> 01:40:03.151
these two armored entities floating in the air.
You see Anders in the corner, clutching a hand

01:40:03.151 --> 01:40:05.918
over one eye with blood streaking down the face, a
number of wounds bleeding out from the armor.

01:40:05.918 --> 01:40:09.486
Already been a rough day for him, and your eye
slips down, and for the first time in a long time,

01:40:09.486 --> 01:40:16.395
you see on the ground before you, clutching her
throat, no wound or blood splatter but clutching

01:40:16.395 --> 01:40:25.485
her throat and breathing heavily, your sister
Cassandra. And you look back up at Anders and you

01:40:25.485 --> 01:40:31.264
feel the burning rage begin to billow up inside
you, and as you walk in the room towards the

01:40:31.264 --> 01:40:36.607
center of the table, you guys who are able to see
the room, you see now, from outside of his

01:40:36.607 --> 01:40:42.549
sleeves, outside from under his coat, there's
blackish purple smoke beginning to (whoosh) billow

01:40:42.549 --> 01:40:43.768
out from behind.

01:40:43.768 --> 01:40:47.326
MARISHA: Does it seem more extreme than it has
been in the past?

01:40:47.326 --> 01:40:50.348
MATT: It seemed pretty extreme in the past. It
just started; you don't know. Go for it.

01:40:50.348 --> 01:40:59.873
TALIESIN: Bonus, I pull off my hat of disguise,
drop it on the floor. And I'm going to just unload

01:40:59.873 --> 01:41:01.287
at that motherfucker.

01:41:01.287 --> 01:41:08.868
MATT: As you pull off the hat, your image shifts
fully to Percy, at which point Anders looks back

01:41:08.868 --> 01:41:14.049
and sees this source of smoke and glances over.
His hand falls away at a moment of realization,

01:41:14.049 --> 01:41:19.199
eye goes wide. "Percy..."

01:41:19.229 --> 01:41:20.527
TALIESIN: Shot one.

01:41:20.583 --> 01:41:22.937
MATT: All right.

01:41:22.937 --> 01:41:25.933
TALIESIN: Oh, for the love of god!

01:41:25.933 --> 01:41:27.651
MARISHA: Oh, when it counts.

01:41:27.651 --> 01:41:30.604
SAM and MARISHA: (ricochet noise)

01:41:30.604 --> 01:41:38.875
MATT: In the frustration, the rage and such, you
pull up your gun and as you go to fire, the bullet

01:41:38.875 --> 01:41:44.149
gets caught in the chamber and it almost ejects
the entire barrel from the front of it. It's not

01:41:44.149 --> 01:41:46.820
too difficult to repair, but it definitely upsets
the current flow.

01:41:46.820 --> 01:41:52.847
TALIESIN: I'm going to attempt to repair it really
quickly. Trying to remember how to do that because

01:41:52.847 --> 01:41:55.921
I hate it. (mumbling)

01:41:55.921 --> 01:42:03.818
MATT: Is it an action or is it an attack to do?
Should say under the--

01:42:03.818 --> 01:42:07.803
TALIESIN: Action, shit.

01:42:07.803 --> 01:42:10.878
MATT: Yeah, so you have to use your next turn to
try and repair it.

01:42:10.878 --> 01:42:16.922
TALIESIN: (sighs) So I'm just going to sit and
scream a little bit. (shouting)

01:42:16.922 --> 01:42:24.635
MATT: Okay, you can see that this whole moment
here, as the smoke pours out from the front of the

01:42:24.635 --> 01:42:30.871
gun, you yell out angrily and there is this
unnatural bassy reverb from your scream that

01:42:30.871 --> 01:42:35.335
shakes the room. Anders actually takes a step back
from this and is looking about the room, and finds

01:42:35.335 --> 01:42:39.062
himself basically trapped in the far corner of his
study.

01:42:39.062 --> 01:42:42.216
MARISHA: Oh, you better not!

01:42:42.216 --> 01:42:43.224
MATT: That ends your turn.

01:42:43.224 --> 01:42:44.388
TALIESIN: That's my turn.

01:42:44.388 --> 01:42:45.283
MATT: Vax.

01:42:45.283 --> 01:42:57.225
LIAM: I'm going to use disengage, and I'm going to
hop over Cassandra towards Anders and stab him in

01:42:57.225 --> 01:42:58.346
the other eye.

01:42:58.346 --> 01:42:59.401
MATT: Okay.

01:42:59.401 --> 01:43:03.025
LIAM: First attack is 21.

01:43:03.025 --> 01:43:04.380
MATT: That hits.

01:43:04.380 --> 01:43:07.400
LIAM: Second attack is 17.

01:43:07.400 --> 01:43:08.850
MATT: That hits.

01:43:08.850 --> 01:43:14.290
LIAM: Okay, ten on the first, ten on the second.

01:43:14.290 --> 01:43:19.983
MATT: Okay. Needs to make concentration checks to
see if he can maintain his Dominate. Against ten

01:43:19.983 --> 01:43:24.740
damage? That succeeds, and yeah, that succeeds. So
he maintains concentration of his spell, but both

01:43:24.740 --> 01:43:29.764
daggers, you just run up and stab him. This angry
grunt under your breath with each stab and you can

01:43:29.764 --> 01:43:34.222
feel the armor itself is now warm with the pooling
blood from the wounds that you gave him before.

01:43:34.222 --> 01:43:36.025
He's looking pretty rough.

01:43:36.025 --> 01:43:39.478
LIAM: So, question? I asked if I could hit the
eye. Did I hit the eye?

01:43:39.478 --> 01:43:45.500
MATT: Unfortunately, no. It's one of those things
where a Sneak Attack would be an eye shot for this

01:43:45.500 --> 01:43:51.731
one. You go and try and stab towards the eye, and
he pulls away; he knows what's coming and uses

01:43:51.731 --> 01:43:57.024
that inertia to jam it into his side and stab a
second time in there. So yeah, no purchase in the

01:43:57.024 --> 01:43:58.018
eye, unfortunately.

01:43:58.018 --> 01:44:00.598
LIAM: Okay. And I'm squared off right in front of
him.

01:44:00.598 --> 01:44:03.671
MATT: Yeah, just right in front of him. That ends
your turn. Grog.

01:44:03.671 --> 01:44:06.765
TRAVIS: So when you're dominated, does that mean
charmed?

01:44:06.765 --> 01:44:12.033
MATT: Essentially, you have to follow his orders.
He's not directly, specifically controlling you

01:44:12.033 --> 01:44:17.615
right now, but he told you, "Attack him," so you
have to use all the things at your disposal to now

01:44:17.615 --> 01:44:18.650
attack him.

01:44:18.650 --> 01:44:22.269
TRAVIS: Okay. I can't try and break the
domination? Or rage?

01:44:22.269 --> 01:44:24.004
MATT: Nope. You get a saving throw at the end of
your turn.

01:44:24.004 --> 01:44:25.053
TRAVIS: I'm not raging.

01:44:25.053 --> 01:44:25.890
MATT: You're not raging.

01:44:25.890 --> 01:44:26.754
TRAVIS: So I only get two.

01:44:26.754 --> 01:44:33.021
MATT: One. You step over Cassandra, (impact noise)
stepping on the back of her leg, and find your way

01:44:33.021 --> 01:44:41.610
right there, which is flanking him between Anders,
so you have advantage on both your attacks.

01:44:41.610 --> 01:44:42.557
LAURA: Shit.

01:44:42.557 --> 01:44:44.902
TRAVIS: It's a three.

01:44:44.902 --> 01:44:45.953
LAURA: That's good.

01:44:45.953 --> 01:44:49.933
TRAVIS: 21.

01:44:49.933 --> 01:44:51.042
LIAM: Yeah.

01:44:51.042 --> 01:44:52.210
MATT: Second attack.

01:44:52.210 --> 01:44:56.031
TRAVIS: 26.

01:44:56.031 --> 01:44:58.343
MATT: Both hit. Go ahead and roll damage.

01:44:58.343 --> 01:45:01.912
TRAVIS: Really trying not to enjoy this.

01:45:01.912 --> 01:45:04.687
MATT: (laughs) With your flaming war hammer.

01:45:04.687 --> 01:45:10.580
TRAVIS: 18 for the first one.

01:45:10.580 --> 01:45:13.227
MATT: 18 points of slashing damage. No, sorry,
bludgeoning damage.

01:45:13.227 --> 01:45:20.556
TRAVIS: Bludgeoning, yeah. And fire. 20, 21.

01:45:20.556 --> 01:45:23.416
MATT: 21 points of bludgeoning and fire damage
with the second strike.

01:45:23.468 --> 01:45:28.994
LIAM: I am on my feet, but I am swaying back and
forth.

01:45:28.994 --> 01:45:32.996
MATT: Unexpectedly, these two titanic slams hit
you from behind. The first one throws you into

01:45:32.996 --> 01:45:38.523
Anders for a second. Anders then pushes you away,
and as you are still reeling from the impact, you

01:45:38.523 --> 01:45:42.773
look up and see the hammer come down, and (whack)
you move your head out in time, preventing you

01:45:42.773 --> 01:45:45.745
from being squished, but the impact hits your
shoulder and the side of your neck, and your whole

01:45:45.745 --> 01:45:50.658
body crumples into itself. You cry out in pain
instinctively, just (screams) from the hit. And

01:45:50.658 --> 01:45:54.938
your whole world blurs for a second as you're
barely keeping yourself on your feet. Grog, that

01:45:54.938 --> 01:45:57.668
ends your turn. You can make another saving throw
with advantage to try and shrug the effect.

01:45:57.668 --> 01:46:01.109
TRAVIS: Yeah. Add wisdom right?

01:46:01.109 --> 01:46:02.141
MATT: Yes.

01:46:02.141 --> 01:46:05.591
TRAVIS: 19?

01:46:05.591 --> 01:46:12.178
MATT: 19. With that, the momentary controlled
bloodshed fades. Your mind becomes your own, and

01:46:12.178 --> 01:46:17.102
what little bit of remorse you may feel for the
battered Vax in front of you, you can't help but

01:46:17.102 --> 01:46:21.784
laugh a little bit. But then you turn your
attention to the one who bent your will, and your

01:46:21.784 --> 01:46:26.444
rage begins to swell up inside you. So that ends
your turn. Scanlan, you're up.

01:46:26.444 --> 01:46:31.060
SAM: I continue my long journey into the room.

01:46:31.060 --> 01:46:36.439
MATT: You just get past there, and you can see
into the room. You have visual on, yeah, pretty

01:46:36.439 --> 01:46:37.852
much everything in the room from there.

01:46:37.852 --> 01:46:39.789
SAM: So I have to make a ranged shot if I'm to do
anything.

01:46:39.789 --> 01:46:40.753
MATT: Correct, yeah.

01:46:40.753 --> 01:46:44.570
SAM: What do I see? Can I see how rough Vax is?

01:46:44.570 --> 01:46:47.044
MATT: At a glance, it's hard to tell.

01:46:47.044 --> 01:46:49.883
LIAM: I'm bleeding out my mouth.

01:46:49.883 --> 01:46:51.752
MATT: He's also facing away from you.

01:46:51.752 --> 01:46:53.227
SAM: Looks normal to me.

01:46:53.227 --> 01:46:57.025
MATT: You see Grog and Vax facing off the guy in
the corner. You see two of these large armored

01:46:57.025 --> 01:46:58.102
entities.

01:46:58.102 --> 01:46:59.403
SAM: Okay, I'll go for them.

01:46:59.403 --> 01:47:00.472
MATT: Okay.

01:47:00.472 --> 01:47:06.845
SAM: Wand of Magic Missiles. And I'll shoot three
at the one at the left. That's the first charge,

01:47:06.845 --> 01:47:09.650
and then use three additional charges on the one
on the right.

01:47:09.650 --> 01:47:13.245
MATT: Okay. How many charges were restored in the
wand from your last long rest?

01:47:13.245 --> 01:47:20.662
SAM: I roll every day, and I restored five and I
had used five, so it's back to normal. I have

01:47:20.662 --> 01:47:21.815
seven total.

01:47:21.815 --> 01:47:23.614
MATT: So you're casting three on one and then--

01:47:23.614 --> 01:47:25.825
SAM: An additional three on the other.

01:47:25.825 --> 01:47:28.913
MATT: Okay, go for it. So that's 3d4 plus three to
each one. Go for it.

01:47:28.913 --> 01:47:30.751
SAM: Right, 3d4. Okay.

01:47:30.751 --> 01:47:34.810
MATT: (magical sound effects) Releasing the wand
on both flicks of your wrist, you can see these

01:47:34.810 --> 01:47:37.569
bursts of arcane energy swirl around and slam into
each one of these creatures.

01:47:37.569 --> 01:47:43.360
SAM: 3d4 plus three? Is that right? Is that how it
works, Matt?

01:47:43.360 --> 01:47:44.165
MATT: Yes.

01:47:44.165 --> 01:47:52.981
SAM: Okay, so five (mumbles), eight. Lame. And
(mumbles) nine, no wait. Yes, nine.

01:47:52.981 --> 01:48:01.469
MATT: Okay. All right. (explosion noise) The
impact hits. You see the armor shake for a second and

01:48:01.469 --> 01:48:07.239
look angered and frustrated for what a faceless
arcane entity in armor could, and both heads just

01:48:07.239 --> 01:48:11.616
go (shhhh) and look in your direction simultaneously. That
ends your turn.

01:48:11.670 --> 01:48:19.623
SAM: Oh, and I will inspire Grog. (sings) This
is the dawning of the age of a-Grog-ius. Age of

01:48:19.623 --> 01:48:23.979
a-Grog-ius. A-Grog-ius!

01:48:23.979 --> 01:48:26.227
(laughter)

01:48:26.227 --> 01:48:27.429
TRAVIS: d10?

01:48:27.429 --> 01:48:30.012
MATT: The words are lost on you, but it's a nice
theme. You take a d10, yeah.

01:48:30.012 --> 01:48:31.686
TRAVIS: Not quite my jam, but I'll still take it.

01:48:31.686 --> 01:48:41.077
MATT: All right, that ends your turn. Anders,
frustrated by the whole circumstance and on the

01:48:41.077 --> 01:48:49.351
cusp of a really bad circumstance, is going to
attempt to cast Dimension Door.

01:48:49.351 --> 01:48:52.050
MARISHA: I knew it. I knew he was going to do
that.

01:48:52.050 --> 01:48:56.952
LIAM: Do I get an attack? A reaction attack?

01:48:56.952 --> 01:48:59.868
MATT: Not unless you have-- there's a feat that
lets you do that.

01:48:59.868 --> 01:49:00.730
LIAM: No.

01:49:00.730 --> 01:49:03.073
MATT: Yeah, I think it's mage slayer.

01:49:03.073 --> 01:49:04.355
LIAM: I don't have that.

01:49:04.355 --> 01:49:05.668
MATT: Okay, all right.

01:49:05.668 --> 01:49:06.851
SAM: Do I see him?

01:49:06.851 --> 01:49:07.975
MATT: Yeah, you see him.

01:49:07.975 --> 01:49:16.663
SAM: I take out my broken shawm and I (piercing
whistle). And I cast Counterspell on him.

01:49:16.663 --> 01:49:18.886
MATT: Right, because you took that when you
leveled up.

01:49:18.886 --> 01:49:20.575
(cheering)

01:49:20.575 --> 01:49:28.459
MATT: All right. Oh lord bards. Shit.

01:49:28.459 --> 01:49:30.050
TRAVIS: (laughs) Shit.

01:49:30.092 --> 01:49:31.963
SAM: Wait, I have to tell a level, don't I?

01:49:31.963 --> 01:49:33.394
MATT: Yeah, you can tell me what level.

01:49:33.394 --> 01:49:35.728
SAM: Do I know, because he's a bard, what he's
doing?

01:49:35.728 --> 01:49:38.861
MATT: You are very familiar with the spell. It is
a 4th-level spell.

01:49:38.861 --> 01:49:40.750
SAM: Then I cast it at fourth level.

01:49:40.750 --> 01:49:47.738
MATT: Okay. Then there is no roll. With that, he
takes a moment to finish casting. You see there's

01:49:47.738 --> 01:49:52.924
a moment where this bit of purple arcane energy,
familiar to most of you as Scanlan's escapes, begins

01:49:52.924 --> 01:49:58.155
to sparkle behind him and as he goes to step into
it, the shawm shrieks out into the room, he

01:49:58.155 --> 01:50:02.445
(groans) reaches up and covers his eye as it
almost seems to be shrill to his head and cause the

01:50:02.445 --> 01:50:05.943
pain to pulse and the doorway just slams behind
him. (panting)

01:50:05.943 --> 01:50:08.290
SAM: Uh-uh, that door is locked, motherfucker!

01:50:08.290 --> 01:50:10.414
(laughter)

01:50:10.414 --> 01:50:12.212
SAM: Get used to it, because I am!

01:50:12.212 --> 01:50:14.180
(laughter)

01:50:14.180 --> 01:50:24.339
MATT: Yeah, that's his turn. That was his action.
He's going to use his bonus action to say, "Come

01:50:24.339 --> 01:50:33.280
"to my aid! Quickly!" He's going to put another
inspiration die to the other armor. And that's

01:50:33.280 --> 01:50:41.221
going to end his turn. It's now their turn. They
are both going to come around. This one is just

01:50:41.221 --> 01:50:44.328
going to move around Grog; no attack of
opportunity because it's still in your melee. This

01:50:44.328 --> 01:50:52.768
one is going to step into range from over here.
This one is going to turn and go for Percy. Sees

01:50:52.768 --> 01:50:56.612
this billowing as you're stuck there trying to fix
the gun, and just rushing towards you with its

01:50:56.612 --> 01:51:02.990
shield forward, its horrible, jagged longsword in
the air arcing towards you. Two strikes versus

01:51:02.990 --> 01:51:07.101
you. That'll be a 19?

01:51:07.101 --> 01:51:09.775
LIAM: That hits.

01:51:09.775 --> 01:51:18.372
MATT: Okay, first strike, you take nine points of
slashing damage.

01:51:18.372 --> 01:51:19.622
LIAM: I'm down.

01:51:19.622 --> 01:51:24.727
MATT: So you go down. Second strike, because it's
still going for you, hits automatically. It's an

01:51:24.727 --> 01:51:27.891
auto critical. You fail two death saving throws.

01:51:27.891 --> 01:51:28.974
LIAM: That's it?

01:51:28.974 --> 01:51:37.883
MATT: That ends its turn. This one is now going
for you, Percy. First strike.

01:51:37.883 --> 01:51:42.034
That would be a nine.

01:51:42.034 --> 01:51:43.069
TALIESIN: No.

01:51:43.069 --> 01:51:47.761
MATT: It's going to use its inspiration die. Add
nine to that, so 18.

01:51:47.761 --> 01:51:49.466
TALIESIN: 18? That's my armor class.

01:51:49.466 --> 01:51:58.824
MATT: (evil laugh) Bards! I'm sorry. I don't get
to use them very often. So that is 11 points of

01:51:58.824 --> 01:52:06.364
slashing damage. And the other strike-- oh, that's
a natural 18, so yeah, that will be... cocked. Oh,

01:52:06.364 --> 01:52:08.421
only eight points of slashing damage.

01:52:08.421 --> 01:52:10.145
TALIESIN: So 19 points of slashing damage, total?

01:52:10.145 --> 01:52:16.060
MATT: Correct. (whooshing) And it's painful, but
not a huge thing at this point. You're so focused

01:52:16.060 --> 01:52:19.898
right now on the weapon. All right. That ends
their turn. Keyleth, you're up.

01:52:19.898 --> 01:52:25.882
MARISHA: Okay, can I see Vax down? Which one
is he on the ground?

01:52:25.882 --> 01:52:30.770
MATT: Vax is right there. You see him get slashed
from behind, fall to the ground, and you see it

01:52:30.780 --> 01:52:35.045
raise a blade again and jam it into his torso,
pull it out, and there's a streak of blood that

01:52:35.071 --> 01:52:38.151
just spatters across the ceiling from the force of
the arc.

01:52:38.151 --> 01:52:41.304
TALIESIN: Yeah, I think you saw that.

01:52:41.304 --> 01:52:47.389
MARISHA: Okay. So I'm going to move around, tuck
in the door a bit.

01:52:47.389 --> 01:52:50.633
MATT: Okay, so you move in and you see this. As
you rush into the room, you see this arc

01:52:50.633 --> 01:52:51.553
happening.

01:52:51.553 --> 01:52:56.563
MARISHA: Can I tuck right here? God, I'm shaking.
Yeah, right behind that door.

01:52:56.563 --> 01:52:59.352
MATT: Right there, yeah. That'll be pretty much
your movement to get there.

01:52:59.352 --> 01:53:06.239
MARISHA: Okay, I'm going to duck down, crouch on
the floor. I'm going to cast-- first I'm going

01:53:06.239 --> 01:53:12.579
to-- god I'm so nervous-- I'm going to use Healing
Word on Vax, and heal that motherfucker.

01:53:12.579 --> 01:53:14.477
MATT: At what level?

01:53:14.477 --> 01:53:17.863
MARISHA: You're like &lt;i&gt;down&lt;/i&gt; down, right?

01:53:17.863 --> 01:53:19.043
LAURA: He's unconscious.

01:53:19.043 --> 01:53:23.587
LIAM: And I-- there wasn't even any rolls for
that, right?

01:53:23.587 --> 01:53:24.602
LAURA: No.

01:53:24.602 --> 01:53:29.042
MATT: If you're unconscious and a creature hits
you, you automatically fail a death saving throw

01:53:29.042 --> 01:53:33.024
and if it's a critical hit, which if you're
unconscious a hit is an automatic critical, it's

01:53:33.024 --> 01:53:34.576
technically two death saving throws.

01:53:34.576 --> 01:53:37.184
LIAM: Yeah, and just to understand the whole
breakdown, but where do the three rolls come in?

01:53:37.184 --> 01:53:38.842
LAURA: If nobody hits you--

01:53:38.842 --> 01:53:40.620
LIAM: Oh, if nobody hits, got it.

01:53:40.620 --> 01:53:43.443
MATT: Yeah, if nobody hits you and it's your turn,
you roll to see if you-- but if something keeps

01:53:43.443 --> 01:53:45.466
hitting you while you're down? Can kill you pretty
quick.

01:53:45.466 --> 01:53:46.447
LIAM: Got it.

01:53:46.447 --> 01:53:47.760
MATT: Like two hits.

01:53:47.760 --> 01:53:51.608
MARISHA: But he just hit zero hit points, so
whatever I bring will bring him over, correct?

01:53:51.608 --> 01:53:55.233
MATT: Yeah, and your death saves go away. It's per
turn. Per time you go down.

01:53:55.233 --> 01:54:00.471
MARISHA: Okay, I'm just going to do a-- I'm sorry,
a level one Healing Word for right now.

01:54:00.471 --> 01:54:01.565
MATT: Okay.

01:54:01.565 --> 01:54:10.105
MARISHA: Yes, which gives you 12 hit points. And
then I'm going to use my bonus action to cast

01:54:10.105 --> 01:54:15.484
Grasping Vine, and I'm going to take the vine and
I'm going to wrap it around--

01:54:15.484 --> 01:54:16.515
MATT: Your source?

01:54:16.515 --> 01:54:17.183
MARISHA: Huh?

01:54:17.183 --> 01:54:18.335
MATT: Which source?

01:54:18.335 --> 01:54:19.863
MARISHA: Next to me.

01:54:19.863 --> 01:54:21.237
MATT: Okay. So right here?

01:54:21.237 --> 01:54:23.285
MARISHA: I guess, yes.

01:54:23.285 --> 01:54:27.336
MATT: Okay so, out of the wood, a vine-- or it's
not wood, actually. This would be a stone wall. So

01:54:27.336 --> 01:54:31.944
out of a crack in the wall, little bit of material
begins to form into a giant vine that forms next to you.

01:54:31.944 --> 01:54:34.088
What are you doing with it?

01:54:34.130 --> 01:54:39.434
MARISHA: I want to wrap it around Cassandra's
feet, her ankle, and I want to

01:54:39.434 --> 01:54:40.667
pull her toward me.

01:54:40.667 --> 01:54:44.182
MATT: You pull her over to the side and she gets
pulled across the ground, and she's on her back

01:54:44.182 --> 01:54:49.449
now looking up. Her eyes are a little starry-eyed,
but she's (panting). Looks very confused, and her

01:54:49.449 --> 01:54:51.277
eyes are still adjusting to the whole
circumstance.

01:54:51.277 --> 01:54:54.713
MARISHA: And I say, "Hi! Just hang on." And that's
my turn.

01:54:54.713 --> 01:54:56.715
MATT: Yep. All right. Vex, you're up.

01:54:56.715 --> 01:54:59.176
LAURA: Okay. So I saw him go down.

01:54:59.176 --> 01:55:00.375
MATT: Yes.

01:55:00.375 --> 01:55:04.655
LAURA: Does it look like he's awake now to me? I'm
mean, it was all happening very quickly.

01:55:04.655 --> 01:55:07.642
MATT: You have no idea. This all happens very
quickly. You just saw your brother take a huge--

01:55:07.642 --> 01:55:09.841
LAURA: I scream and I run towards him.

01:55:09.841 --> 01:55:11.080
MATT: Okay.

01:55:11.080 --> 01:55:16.466
LAURA: I slide down on my knees and slide across
the room and try to cast Healing Word the minute--

01:55:16.466 --> 01:55:18.212
or cast Cure Wounds the minute I get to him.

01:55:18.212 --> 01:55:19.736
MATT: You won't get close enough to do it,
unfortunately.

01:55:19.736 --> 01:55:21.688
LAURA: If I slide down and slide?

01:55:21.688 --> 01:55:28.614
MATT: Make an acrobatics check. For this
circumstance, due to the circumstances with your

01:55:28.614 --> 01:55:30.909
brother being on the ground, I'll let this be a
little more intense.

01:55:30.909 --> 01:55:33.113
SAM: With inspiration.

01:55:33.113 --> 01:55:40.150
LAURA: With inspiration. That is-- wait, hold on.

01:55:40.150 --> 01:55:41.481
LIAM: Acrobatics.

01:55:41.481 --> 01:55:42.414
LAURA: Acrobatics?

01:55:42.414 --> 01:55:43.234
MATT: Yeah.

01:55:43.234 --> 01:55:45.306
LAURA: Oh, that's good. 17?

01:55:45.306 --> 01:55:50.617
MATT: 17, all right. With that, you rush forward,
just seeing this tunnel vision image of Vax on the

01:55:50.617 --> 01:55:55.241
ground, blood pooling under his form. You dart
forward, slam on your knees and begin preparing

01:55:55.241 --> 01:56:00.385
the spell as you skid across the stone floor of
the study. You reach out and your hands meet his

01:56:00.385 --> 01:56:05.558
form, stopping you in the process just as the surge of
healing energy jolts through his body. So you can

01:56:05.558 --> 01:56:07.020
go ahead and cast it on him.

01:56:07.020 --> 01:56:22.806
LAURA: Okay, so I'm going to cast that at 3rd
level. So that's 3d8. Where are my d8s? That was

01:56:22.852 --> 01:56:26.580
the worst roll! Nine!

01:56:26.580 --> 01:56:28.345
MATT: So you heal nine hit points.

01:56:28.345 --> 01:56:29.639
LIAM: That's good.

01:56:29.639 --> 01:56:31.889
LAURA: That's okay, because I slid to you.

01:56:31.889 --> 01:56:34.486
LIAM: It was amazing. I'll never forget it.

01:56:34.486 --> 01:56:37.738
MATT: (laughs) Okay, that's your turn.

01:56:37.738 --> 01:56:40.080
LAURA: Yeah, and Trinket keeps dragging her.

01:56:40.080 --> 01:56:53.459
MATT: Forward? Okay. That ends your turn. All
right, go ahead and roll an athletics check for

01:56:53.459 --> 01:56:55.955
Trinket.

01:56:55.955 --> 01:57:09.217
LAURA: Right, okay. It's going to count even
though it slipped out of my hand. It's eight.

01:57:09.217 --> 01:57:20.304
MATT: Eight? Okay. Trinket, holding onto the
scruff of Ripley's neck. Ripley then tugs away

01:57:20.304 --> 01:57:26.614
from the grip. Reaches into the pouch she had
earlier. As a bonus action throws down a small

01:57:26.614 --> 01:57:34.263
rock that (explosion noise) fills this entire
tunnel here with a 20 by 20 fog cloud, apparently.

01:57:34.263 --> 01:57:38.475
And now that she's disengaged, she's going
to...

01:57:38.567 --> 01:57:40.377
MARISHA: She smoke-bombed out.

01:57:40.377 --> 01:57:42.095
LAURA: She ain't got no weapons.

01:57:42.095 --> 01:57:49.181
MATT: Nope. Trinket does get an attack of
opportunity on her as she runs past.

01:57:49.181 --> 01:57:51.321
SAM: Yeah, Trinket does. Come on, Trinket.

01:57:51.321 --> 01:58:00.911
LAURA: All right, he's going to bite her. Can he
cannonball her as an attack of opportunity?

01:58:00.911 --> 01:58:02.066
MATT: No, unfortunately.

01:58:02.066 --> 01:58:03.076
LAURA: No? Not so much?

01:58:03.076 --> 01:58:04.343
MATT: No, sorry.

01:58:04.343 --> 01:58:07.495
LAURA: Nine.

01:58:07.495 --> 01:58:09.282
MATT: Nine. All right

01:58:09.282 --> 01:58:12.358
LAURA: Oh wait! Oh, no. I've got to roll for
attack first, huh?

01:58:12.358 --> 01:58:13.682
MATT: Yeah.

01:58:13.682 --> 01:58:19.408
LAURA: That was not what I was doing. So that's
21.

01:58:19.408 --> 01:58:20.505
MATT: That hits, yeah.

01:58:20.505 --> 01:58:21.616
LAURA: Okay, good. That's way better.

01:58:21.616 --> 01:58:22.712
MATT: She has no armor.

01:58:22.712 --> 01:58:28.839
LAURA: Oh, I don't know what I'm doing. What is
going on? I never attack with Trinket. 13.

01:58:28.839 --> 01:58:30.786
MATT: Okay, got it.

01:58:30.786 --> 01:58:32.218
TALIESIN: Cautionary tale in there somewhere.

01:58:32.218 --> 01:58:37.708
MATT: She runs past. The whole area is obscured
for Trinket. Trinket for the moment really has no

01:58:37.708 --> 01:58:43.613
idea really where she went as she rushed past, and
bit out and is now giving out this (bear growl)

01:58:43.613 --> 01:58:48.385
notification growl sound, but in the chaos right
now, it's not catching your attention as your

01:58:48.385 --> 01:58:49.718
brother nearly died before you.

01:58:49.718 --> 01:58:50.669
LAURA: Right.

01:58:50.669 --> 01:58:52.703
MATT: All right, that ends her turn. Percy, you're
up.

01:58:52.703 --> 01:58:57.207
TALIESIN: I'm going to break-- first off, I'm
going to fix my gun.

01:58:57.207 --> 01:58:59.635
MATT: Okay, go ahead and make your roll.

01:58:59.713 --> 01:59:14.948
TALIESIN: I'm going to make my roll. Come on. What
do I have to roll? (muttering) I hit the

01:59:14.948 --> 01:59:16.926
difficulty. Does that--

01:59:16.926 --> 01:59:23.208
MATT: You hit it, then yeah. With the creature
looming there, you manage to bend it back into

01:59:23.208 --> 01:59:28.633
place. You get it aligned as best as you can.
That's your action, though.

01:59:28.633 --> 01:59:31.819
TALIESIN: If that had been a slightly bigger
fuck-up, that would have been-- oh god! Okay.

01:59:31.819 --> 01:59:33.895
MATT: So your gun's functional, but that's your
action.

01:59:33.895 --> 01:59:37.367
TALIESIN: I'm going to use an action surge anyway,
so it doesn't matter.

01:59:37.367 --> 01:59:38.680
MATT: Yes, you are. Okay.

01:59:38.680 --> 01:59:44.513
TALIESIN: I'm going to break off from this guy,
and I'm going to rush towards Professor.

01:59:44.513 --> 01:59:46.808
MATT: Okay, gets an attack of opportunity on you.

01:59:46.808 --> 01:59:48.899
TALIESIN: Go ahead. Don't care.

01:59:48.899 --> 01:59:50.403
MATT: Guy rolls a 14.

01:59:50.403 --> 01:59:51.291
TALIESIN: Yeah.

01:59:51.291 --> 01:59:54.557
MATT: So you just (whoosh) duck under it
instinctually. It comes toward you. Eyes forward,

01:59:54.557 --> 01:59:55.812
you duck underneath the blade.

01:59:55.812 --> 01:59:57.207
TALIESIN: I push him in the face. I don't care.

01:59:57.207 --> 02:00:00.418
MATT: Okay, you get right up to there, and you can
see Anders backing away as you approach.

02:00:00.418 --> 02:00:01.896
TALIESIN: I'm going to unload in him.

02:00:01.896 --> 02:00:03.110
MATT: Go for it.

02:00:03.110 --> 02:00:07.676
TALIESIN: That's 21 to hit.

02:00:07.676 --> 02:00:08.606
MATT: That hits.

02:00:08.606 --> 02:00:12.284
TALIESIN: That's 25 to hit.

02:00:12.284 --> 02:00:13.613
MATT: That hits.

02:00:13.613 --> 02:00:16.287
TALIESIN: That's a natural 20.

02:00:16.287 --> 02:00:18.007
MARISHA: There is Percy!

02:00:18.007 --> 02:00:19.682
TRAVIS: What the fuck?

02:00:19.682 --> 02:00:21.510
MATT: Anti-Wheaton.

02:00:21.510 --> 02:00:29.462
TALIESIN: Okay, let's see, that's 11.

02:00:29.462 --> 02:00:30.583
MATT: Okay.

02:00:30.583 --> 02:00:34.005
TALIESIN: 14.

02:00:34.005 --> 02:00:40.008
MATT: All righty. This is the critical.

02:00:40.008 --> 02:00:49.118
TALIESIN: Yep, this is the critical which is
seven, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 20 with fire damage.

02:00:49.118 --> 02:00:51.674
MATT: Okay. How do you want to do this?

02:00:51.674 --> 02:00:53.530
(cheering)

02:00:53.530 --> 02:01:00.588
TALIESIN: How close to him do I get? And this was
without smoke damage, I might add.

02:01:00.588 --> 02:01:04.085
MATT: You can get one more step up there. You can
take the shots as you're stepping towards him,

02:01:04.085 --> 02:01:05.081
unloading.

02:01:05.081 --> 02:01:06.532
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm unloading as I walk towards
him.

02:01:06.532 --> 02:01:11.017
MATT: So the first one (gunshot) blasts out the
shoulder. You can see the bone exposed, the metal

02:01:11.017 --> 02:01:21.703
breastplate sundered by the bullet, as he backs up
(gasping) As you're walking towards him, he begins

02:01:21.703 --> 02:01:28.184
shouting, "Percival, you disappoint us all. All
you had to do was die like a good de Rolo."

02:01:28.184 --> 02:01:32.595
TALIESIN: Traitor! And I've got two more shots.
Next shot.

02:01:32.595 --> 02:01:38.081
MATT: This one (gunshot) into his chest, and you
can see the actual breastplate bends inward to the

02:01:38.081 --> 02:01:43.776
wound and he's (choking noise) spitting out blood
from his mouth as he bends forward. "This land has

02:01:43.776 --> 02:01:51.526
"a greater destiny. You and that fool Ripley, you
place your faith in toys and dust. You seek the

02:01:51.526 --> 02:01:52.956
"transient truths."

02:01:52.956 --> 02:01:57.019
TALIESIN: How close am I to him at this point?

02:01:57.019 --> 02:01:58.417
MATT: You're stepping up to him.

02:01:58.417 --> 02:01:59.480
TALIESIN: Perfect.

02:01:59.480 --> 02:02:04.674
MATT: And as you're doing this, as you're pull the
mask down, he says, "I die to rise again. We are

02:02:04.674 --> 02:02:05.912
"his blood."

02:02:05.912 --> 02:02:12.016
TALIESIN: I put my gun in his mouth to shut him
the fuck up. "You're the face I saw when murder

02:02:12.016 --> 02:02:16.306
"entered my heart. This is your doing." And I pull
the trigger.

02:02:16.306 --> 02:02:22.546
MATT: With that, a resounding blast (explosion
noise) echoes through the room. The back of his

02:02:22.546 --> 02:02:28.973
head just scatters across the wall behind him. The
top of his head folds in a little bit from the

02:02:28.973 --> 02:02:36.012
lack of a substantial base, and he tumbles
backwards, releasing the gun with a limp (splat)

02:02:36.012 --> 02:02:42.026
onto the ground behind. You're still holding the
Pepperbox in front of you, hands shaking. As you

02:02:42.026 --> 02:02:45.551
hold it there, looking at it, you can see there's
a flash of purple energy across the barrel that

02:02:45.551 --> 02:02:50.022
has Anders's name across it and (fluttering noise)
the name burns away, leaving the barrel blank.

02:02:50.022 --> 02:02:53.845
TALIESIN: (heavy breathing)

02:02:53.845 --> 02:02:59.243
MATT: Smoke begins to subside a little bit. It's
still there, but it seems like at the moment, it

02:02:59.243 --> 02:03:00.810
has this release aspect to it.

02:03:00.810 --> 02:03:02.277
TALIESIN: That's my turn.

02:03:02.277 --> 02:03:04.984
MATT: Yeah, that is your turn. Vax you're up.

02:03:04.984 --> 02:03:09.759
LIAM: How close are the suits of armor to me? I
can't tell.

02:03:09.759 --> 02:03:15.469
MATT: There's one over here, and there's one--
technically it's right next to you.

02:03:15.469 --> 02:03:17.312
LIAM: Right next to me? And am I still prone?

02:03:17.312 --> 02:03:18.376
MATT: You're still prone.

02:03:18.376 --> 02:03:19.618
LIAM: So how much movement does it take to--

02:03:19.618 --> 02:03:20.634
MATT: Half your movement.

02:03:20.634 --> 02:03:21.802
LIAM: Half my movement.

02:03:21.802 --> 02:03:23.468
SAM: Don't give him an attack of opportunity.

02:03:23.468 --> 02:03:26.382
LIAM: No, I'm going to get up, and I'm going to
use disengage.

02:03:26.382 --> 02:03:28.007
MATT: As a bonus action, okay.

02:03:28.007 --> 02:03:32.594
LIAM: Yeah, and I'm going to skip back into the
corner, and at this point I can throw one dagger

02:03:32.594 --> 02:03:35.036
at that suit of armor, so I'm going to do that.

02:03:35.036 --> 02:03:36.077
MATT: Yes, you can.

02:03:36.077 --> 02:03:39.042
LIAM: That is 19.

02:03:39.042 --> 02:03:40.163
MATT: That hits.

02:03:40.163 --> 02:03:44.720
LIAM: I have no voice left. That is an 11.

02:03:44.720 --> 02:04:07.381
MATT: 11 points of damage, all righty. Great,
okay. Let's see here now. That ends your turn. I

02:04:07.381 --> 02:04:09.585
had the list down here. All right. Grog, you're
up.

02:04:09.585 --> 02:04:12.253
TRAVIS: Am I flanked by two suits of armor or just
one?

02:04:12.253 --> 02:04:13.405
MATT: Nope, there's just one right next to you.

02:04:13.405 --> 02:04:15.409
TRAVIS: I'll turn to him and rage.

02:04:15.409 --> 02:04:16.782
MATT: Okay. Regular rage.

02:04:16.782 --> 02:04:18.826
TRAVIS: Regular rage, and swing away.

02:04:18.826 --> 02:04:20.517
LIAM: Classic rage, we call it.

02:04:20.517 --> 02:04:21.511
TRAVIS: Classic rage.

02:04:21.511 --> 02:04:22.765
LAURA: Good old classic rage.

02:04:22.765 --> 02:04:24.950
TRAVIS: 14?

02:04:24.950 --> 02:04:26.256
MATT: 14 hits.

02:04:26.256 --> 02:04:29.252
TRAVIS: Nice. And 25.

02:04:29.252 --> 02:04:30.817
MATT: Both hit, yeah.

02:04:30.817 --> 02:04:31.719
LAURA: You get three hits.

02:04:31.719 --> 02:04:32.719
TRAVIS: Nah, just two.

02:04:32.719 --> 02:04:33.715
LAURA: I thought rage-- oh.

02:04:33.715 --> 02:04:45.785
TRAVIS: Believe me, I know. 17 with the fire
damage. First one.

02:04:45.785 --> 02:04:47.262
MATT: Okay.

02:04:47.262 --> 02:04:52.486
TRAVIS: 18 on the second one.

02:04:52.486 --> 02:05:00.460
MATT: Okay, cool. So as you slam your hammer twice
into it, the armor dents. You can see now, the

02:05:00.460 --> 02:05:05.005
energy that's holding it together is flickering,
almost like the arcane entity that resides within

02:05:05.005 --> 02:05:09.945
it is having a hard time keeping itself in
physical form. All right. That end your turn,

02:05:09.945 --> 02:05:11.483
unless you want to move or do anything else.

02:05:11.483 --> 02:05:12.438
TRAVIS: Nope.

02:05:12.438 --> 02:05:13.563
SAM: Did you hit?

02:05:13.563 --> 02:05:14.503
MATT: Scanlan. You're up.

02:05:14.503 --> 02:05:15.409
TRAVIS: Yeah, twice.

02:05:15.409 --> 02:05:18.475
SAM: Okay. Oh, me? Oh man, I can't do anything
against these fuckers.

02:05:18.475 --> 02:05:20.874
MARISHA: Yes, you can.

02:05:20.874 --> 02:05:22.244
LIAM: You're Scanlan Shorthalt.

02:05:22.244 --> 02:05:23.854
MARISHA: Believe!

02:05:23.854 --> 02:05:31.454
SAM: All right. I'll enter the room, I suppose.
Just a little. Right there.

02:05:31.454 --> 02:05:32.806
MARISHA: Just the tip.

02:05:32.806 --> 02:05:42.111
SAM: Just the tip, and shit. I don't want to waste
anything on these fuckers. Okay, let's see here.

02:05:42.111 --> 02:05:49.486
I'll just do-- 2d8. All right, I'll run up.
Actually, a little bit closer to the guy closest

02:05:49.486 --> 02:05:51.623
to me.

02:05:51.623 --> 02:05:53.124
MATT: Okay. You'll get into melee with him if you
do.

02:05:53.124 --> 02:05:56.004
SAM: What does that mean?

02:05:56.004 --> 02:05:59.253
MATT: Means if you want to do any ranged attack or
spell attack roll, you would have disadvantage on

02:05:59.253 --> 02:06:00.692
it, but otherwise it has no effect.

02:06:00.692 --> 02:06:03.139
LAURA: He can attack you, though, because he's
right next to you.

02:06:03.139 --> 02:06:04.354
SAM: He won't be for long.

02:06:04.354 --> 02:06:05.678
MATT: Okay.

02:06:05.678 --> 02:06:10.130
SAM: So I get up close in, like five feet away,
and then I'll just Thunderwave him.

02:06:10.130 --> 02:06:11.349
MATT: Okay.

02:06:11.349 --> 02:06:15.208
SAM: I do that thing where frat boys do the chest
bump.

02:06:15.208 --> 02:06:16.917
MARISHA: Like, "Come at me, bro?"

02:06:16.917 --> 02:06:18.813
SAM: Yeah. (grunts)

02:06:18.813 --> 02:06:21.306
MARISHA: That's awesome.

02:06:21.353 --> 02:06:23.426
TRAVIS: (quietly) We did do that.

02:06:23.467 --> 02:06:25.228
MATT: All righty.

02:06:25.255 --> 02:06:29.901
SAM: That's just like 2d8.

02:06:29.901 --> 02:06:31.232
MATT: Yeah, okay.

02:06:31.232 --> 02:06:32.902
LIAM: Roll two d8s.

02:06:32.902 --> 02:06:34.598
MATT: Is this the 1st-level Thunderwave?

02:06:34.598 --> 02:06:36.487
SAM: I believe it is, yes.

02:06:36.487 --> 02:06:43.072
MATT: Okay, so makes a constitution saving throw.
No, he rolled a natural four, so it takes 2d8

02:06:43.072 --> 02:06:49.479
thunder damage and he is pushed over the table,
and then would fall over if it wasn't now drifting

02:06:49.479 --> 02:06:53.949
above the ground a few inches. Rights itself, but
it did push it away from you. Roll 2d8 damage.

02:06:53.949 --> 02:06:56.149
SAM: I did. It's only nine points of damage.

02:06:56.149 --> 02:07:02.213
MATT: Nine points of thunder damage against that
helmed creature. All right, that brings us to

02:07:02.213 --> 02:07:08.155
their turn. This creature you just slammed into is
going to rush back towards you. This one's going

02:07:08.155 --> 02:07:13.881
to turn and attack you, Grog. Two strikes against
you. That is a 15.

02:07:13.881 --> 02:07:15.038
TRAVIS: Misses.

02:07:15.038 --> 02:07:16.694
MATT: Sorry. 25. Rolled an 18 naturally.

02:07:16.694 --> 02:07:17.586
TRAVIS: Hits.

02:07:17.586 --> 02:07:18.504
MATT: And that is a 21.

02:07:18.504 --> 02:07:19.288
TRAVIS: Both hit.

02:07:19.288 --> 02:07:26.239
MATT: Okay, so you take six points of slashing
damage, halved to three, and nine points slashing

02:07:26.239 --> 02:07:31.379
damage, halved to five. So eight points of
slashing damage total. Two strikes against you,

02:07:31.379 --> 02:07:33.816
Scanlan. That is an 18.

02:07:33.816 --> 02:07:35.150
SAM: Oh, yes. That hits.

02:07:35.150 --> 02:07:37.468
MATT: Okay, and then a 12.

02:07:37.468 --> 02:07:38.957
SAM: Hey, that misses!

02:07:38.957 --> 02:07:46.977
MATT: So you take-- that's seven plus 11 points of
slashing damage. (whoosh) As it goes to strike a

02:07:46.977 --> 02:07:53.051
second time, you see the second blow coming and
just duck out of the way. That ends their go. Next

02:07:53.051 --> 02:07:54.590
up is Keyleth.

02:07:54.590 --> 02:07:56.250
MARISHA: So there are two guys alive right now?

02:07:56.250 --> 02:07:57.219
MATT: Correct, yes.

02:07:57.219 --> 02:07:58.730
MARISHA: One's on Scanlan.

02:07:58.730 --> 02:08:03.102
MATT: One's on Grog. The one on Grog is looking a
little rough. The one near Scanlan's doing okay.

02:08:03.102 --> 02:08:05.827
MARISHA: How's Cassandra looking next to me?

02:08:05.827 --> 02:08:11.340
MATT: She's fine. There's no blood. There's
nothing; the wound is gone entirely. But other

02:08:11.340 --> 02:08:12.779
than that, she looks fine.

02:08:12.779 --> 02:08:19.921
MARISHA: Looks fine. Okay, I've got my Grasping
Vine still up. I'm going to wrap it around the guy

02:08:19.921 --> 02:08:23.691
that's close to Scanlan and just yank him off of
Scanlan.

02:08:23.691 --> 02:08:31.148
MATT: Okay. This pulls him over Scanlan's form and
slams him right next to Cassandra.

02:08:31.148 --> 02:08:43.017
MARISHA: Okay, and then I will just go, oh! And
pop him with my staff.

02:08:43.017 --> 02:08:44.039
MATT: Go for it.

02:08:44.039 --> 02:08:45.360
SAM: You can hit things?

02:08:45.360 --> 02:08:52.231
MARISHA: Yeah, I got a big old staff, yo! I'm not
great at it, but I can do it. Oh, that's not bad.

02:08:52.231 --> 02:08:53.333
16.

02:08:53.333 --> 02:08:55.230
MATT: 16 does not hit, unfortunately.

02:08:55.230 --> 02:08:56.920
MARISHA: Aw. (ping)

02:08:56.920 --> 02:08:58.450
SAM: He's got armor.

02:08:58.450 --> 02:09:00.322
MARISHA: It sounded nice, though.

02:09:00.322 --> 02:09:01.249
SAM: It did.

02:09:01.249 --> 02:09:02.812
MARISHA: Kind of resonated a little.

02:09:02.812 --> 02:09:08.482
MATT: Shakes off of it for a second. All right, so
that ends your turn?

02:09:08.482 --> 02:09:09.450
MARISHA: Yep.

02:09:09.450 --> 02:09:10.810
MATT: All righty. That brings us to Vex.

02:09:10.810 --> 02:09:12.151
LAURA: So I'm still down on my knees.

02:09:12.151 --> 02:09:14.509
MATT: You're still down on your knees. Your
brother got up and rushed off, he seems okay,

02:09:14.509 --> 02:09:16.697
(panting) taking a breath for himself.

02:09:16.743 --> 02:09:22.369
LAURA: I look up at Percy who is covered in smoke,
and I grab his hand and I say,

02:09:22.369 --> 02:09:25.910
"Percival, how are you?"

02:09:25.910 --> 02:09:29.735
MATT: His head slowly turns towards you, the mask
still on. You can see his eyes just barely through

02:09:29.735 --> 02:09:33.805
the glistening circular glass slots where he looks
through. The smoke still billowing up from

02:09:33.805 --> 02:09:36.803
underneath, the head slowly turns towards you.

02:09:36.803 --> 02:09:37.977
TALIESIN: Fine.

02:09:37.977 --> 02:09:40.763
LAURA: "Darling, take the mask off," and I--

02:09:40.763 --> 02:09:42.477
TALIESIN: I don't have a turn yet.

02:09:42.477 --> 02:09:43.539
MATT: No.

02:09:43.539 --> 02:09:46.840
LAURA: And I shoot at the guy that's attacking
Grog.

02:09:46.840 --> 02:09:52.616
MATT: Okay. He is technically in melee with you,
so you get disadvantage on these strikes unless

02:09:52.616 --> 02:09:54.304
you want to move away.

02:09:54.304 --> 02:09:58.215
LAURA: Does he get an attack of opportunity,
though, if I scooch back?

02:09:58.215 --> 02:10:01.450
MATT: He would, unless-- he didn't take one
against you when you ran back because you

02:10:01.450 --> 02:10:02.740
disengaged, so yes, he would.

02:10:02.740 --> 02:10:04.020
LAURA: Okay, yeah.

02:10:04.020 --> 02:10:09.139
MATT: Okay, so you move back a step. That is a
21.

02:10:09.139 --> 02:10:10.519
LAURA: Hits.

02:10:10.519 --> 02:10:14.822
MATT: Okay, you take nine points of slashing
damage as you reach back. The creature (whoosh)

02:10:14.822 --> 02:10:16.868
arcs with its sword and manages to strike you.

02:10:16.868 --> 02:10:17.871
LAURA: Bastard!

02:10:17.871 --> 02:10:19.299
MATT: Roll for your attacks.

02:10:19.299 --> 02:10:27.050
LAURA: Okay, that is a 26 and a 23.

02:10:27.050 --> 02:10:30.918
MATT: Both hit.

02:10:30.918 --> 02:10:41.456
LAURA: I didn't Hunter's Mark him, because I'm
brilliant. Yes! 15, 30, 34 points.

02:10:41.456 --> 02:10:43.745
MATT: 34 points of damage for both?

02:10:43.745 --> 02:10:49.067
LAURA: Yeah, two eights. Plus 14. Plus my
bracers.

02:10:49.067 --> 02:10:54.428
MATT: Right. You pull the arrows out and launch
them both simultaneously, two arrows in one notch;

02:10:54.428 --> 02:10:58.683
release them both. One slams into the armor. That
one goes underneath the helmet, and as it strikes

02:10:58.683 --> 02:11:04.038
you hear this horrible echoing (screeching)
screech that echoes as the armor (thud) falls to

02:11:04.038 --> 02:11:04.903
the ground.

02:11:04.903 --> 02:11:05.964
TRAVIS: Yeah!

02:11:05.964 --> 02:11:09.776
MATT: You can take the rest of your movement, if
you like.

02:11:09.776 --> 02:11:12.431
LAURA: I stand up.

02:11:12.431 --> 02:11:15.316
MATT: Well, you were standing up to move back.

02:11:15.316 --> 02:11:16.320
LAURA: I scooched back, right?

02:11:16.320 --> 02:11:17.965
MATT: Unless you wanted to be like--

02:11:17.965 --> 02:11:19.457
LAURA: Yeah I wanted to be like--

02:11:19.457 --> 02:11:21.311
MATT: Okay, so you pulled back while on the
ground. Release the arrows.

02:11:21.311 --> 02:11:22.625
LAURA: Yeah, like up into them.

02:11:22.625 --> 02:11:27.281
MATT: There you go. All right. Stand up, brush
yourself off. That ends your go.

02:11:27.281 --> 02:11:30.429
LAURA: And Trinket isn't allowed to move any at
all?

02:11:30.429 --> 02:11:31.877
MATT: Trinket can, if you want.

02:11:31.877 --> 02:11:33.028
LAURA: Can he run after her?

02:11:33.028 --> 02:11:39.707
MATT: Yep. Rushes out. Will get there. Rushes
through the fog and looks over and sees her right

02:11:39.707 --> 02:11:49.284
there. Okay. That ends your turn, and now it's her
turn. She goes into a full dash and takes off.

02:11:49.284 --> 02:11:50.964
TALIESIN: Does Trinket get an attack of
opportunity for that?

02:11:50.964 --> 02:11:52.633
MATT: Trinket does get attack of opportunity.

02:11:52.633 --> 02:11:53.486
LAURA: Okay.

02:11:53.486 --> 02:11:54.487
MARISHA: Come on, Trinket.

02:11:54.487 --> 02:11:55.440
TRAVIS: Scratch her up.

02:11:55.440 --> 02:11:56.722
LAURA: That's in the corner. I can't really say.

02:11:56.722 --> 02:12:00.588
TRAVIS: Oh, you piece of shit

02:12:00.588 --> 02:12:01.692
LIAM: (clicks his teeth together)

02:12:01.692 --> 02:12:03.139
LAURA: Don't do that. I hate that sound.

02:12:03.139 --> 02:12:05.021
(laughter)

02:12:05.021 --> 02:12:06.033
MATT: So what did you roll?

02:12:06.033 --> 02:12:07.868
LAURA: That's a 12.

02:12:07.868 --> 02:12:09.062
LIAM: Good to know.

02:12:09.351 --> 02:12:10.367
MATT: 12?

02:12:10.367 --> 02:12:11.286
LAURA: Yeah.

02:12:11.286 --> 02:12:12.380
MATT: 12 does not hit, unfortunately.

02:12:12.380 --> 02:12:13.187
LAURA: No, it doesn't.

02:12:13.187 --> 02:12:16.524
MATT: Even with no armor, she's a pretty quick
one. She ducks below and bolts down the hallway

02:12:16.524 --> 02:12:17.758
and around the corner.

02:12:17.758 --> 02:12:19.797
TRAVIS: Why did we let her have anything?

02:12:19.797 --> 02:12:20.726
MATT: All right.

02:12:20.726 --> 02:12:21.769
LAURA: You're out.

02:12:21.769 --> 02:12:25.228
MATT: So that ends your turn, her turn. Percy,
you're up.

02:12:25.228 --> 02:12:39.717
TALIESIN: I'm going to pull off the mask and walk
forward a bit, about there, and take three shots

02:12:39.717 --> 02:12:41.255
at the armor.

02:12:41.255 --> 02:12:42.344
MATT: Okay, regular shots?

02:12:42.344 --> 02:12:43.640
TALIESIN: Sharpshooter shots.

02:12:43.640 --> 02:12:44.571
MATT: Okay.

02:12:44.571 --> 02:12:49.950
TALIESIN: With one ice, so 14.

02:12:49.950 --> 02:12:53.120
MATT: 14 misses. Deflects it with the shield.

02:12:53.120 --> 02:13:00.221
TALIESIN: Make sure I'm doing this right. Yeah.
Goddamn it. 17.

02:13:00.221 --> 02:13:02.259
MATT: Deflects the second one with the shield.

02:13:02.259 --> 02:13:03.338
LAURA: Damn it!

02:13:03.338 --> 02:13:04.696
MATT: Heavy armor on this one.

02:13:04.696 --> 02:13:06.601
TALIESIN: Dropping sharpshooter for the third
one.

02:13:06.601 --> 02:13:09.151
MATT: Okay.

02:13:09.151 --> 02:13:13.104
TALIESIN: Not that it helped. 16.

02:13:13.104 --> 02:13:17.565
MATT: This one actually manages to duck out of the
way and splinters across the wall behind it.

02:13:17.565 --> 02:13:20.309
SAM: They're tough.

02:13:20.309 --> 02:13:22.170
TALIESIN: That's my turn.

02:13:22.170 --> 02:13:23.551
MATT: All righty. Vax, you're up.

02:13:23.551 --> 02:13:24.585
MARISHA: Kill them.

02:13:24.585 --> 02:13:29.594
LIAM: I'm just going to walk as far as I can, so
30 feet.

02:13:29.594 --> 02:13:31.419
MATT: There.

02:13:31.419 --> 02:13:33.720
LIAM: Am I within 40 feet?

02:13:33.720 --> 02:13:36.651
MATT: No.

02:13:36.651 --> 02:13:38.545
LIAM: Then I just stand.

02:13:38.545 --> 02:13:40.987
MATT: Well, you can use the rest of your action to
keep moving, if you'd like.

02:13:40.987 --> 02:13:46.141
LIAM: All right, yeah. I'm going to move around
that table and get by Scanlan.

02:13:46.141 --> 02:13:47.534
Stand right next to him.

02:13:47.534 --> 02:13:49.990
MATT: Okay, that brings us to Grog.

02:13:49.990 --> 02:13:52.349
TRAVIS: I would like to move to the suit of armor
please.

02:13:52.349 --> 02:14:00.116
MATT: Run towards it, jumping and putting one foot
on the table; using that as momentum to rush in

02:14:00.116 --> 02:14:03.129
the air. Go ahead and roll
your attack.

02:14:03.129 --> 02:14:05.217
TRAVIS: 24?

02:14:05.217 --> 02:14:06.992
MATT: 24 hits.

02:14:06.992 --> 02:14:08.284
TRAVIS: And 25.

02:14:08.284 --> 02:14:09.762
MATT: That hits.

02:14:09.762 --> 02:14:15.388
TRAVIS: 20 with fire damage.

02:14:15.388 --> 02:14:16.542
MATT: Nice.

02:14:16.542 --> 02:14:21.658
TRAVIS: And 16 with fire damage.

02:14:21.658 --> 02:14:27.066
MATT: Gotcha. (grunts) Bringing the hammer down,
the helmet actually gets pushed into the armor and

02:14:27.066 --> 02:14:30.239
has to reform itself. Before it has a chance to,
you bring around the hammer and hit the shield

02:14:30.239 --> 02:14:34.416
with such force that it pushes it into itself and
slams it against the wall. You take the back of

02:14:34.416 --> 02:14:39.775
the hammer and slam it up under the actual helmet,
hitting the creature. You see the flames burn

02:14:39.775 --> 02:14:43.584
across the side of its arcane form, causing it to
shimmer for a second. It's looking pretty rough.

WEBVTT
Kind: captions
Language: en

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.555
MATT: Instead of using the table, though, you use
Grog's knee. You just run, jump onto his knee with

00:00:03.555 --> 00:00:05.959
one foot, leap off, blade in the air, go for the
strike.

00:00:05.959 --> 00:00:06.891
MARISHA: That's cool!

00:00:06.891 --> 00:00:10.394
LAURA: You can do it, Scanlan! (laughs)

00:00:10.394 --> 00:00:11.593
SAM: What do I add?

00:00:11.593 --> 00:00:12.543
MARISHA: Your attack bonus.

00:00:12.543 --> 00:00:13.706
MATT: Attack bonus for your weapon.

00:00:13.706 --> 00:00:14.606
SAM: I don't know what that is!

00:00:14.606 --> 00:00:16.293
(laughter)

00:00:16.365 --> 00:00:17.495
TRAVIS: It is never used.

00:00:17.495 --> 00:00:18.958
SAM: Okay. It's a plus seven!

00:00:18.958 --> 00:00:19.959
MATT: Yeah, so?

00:00:19.959 --> 00:00:20.805
SAM: 15.

00:00:20.805 --> 00:00:21.902
(laughter)

00:00:21.902 --> 00:00:24.961
MATT: As you rush in the air, you hesitate for a
moment, remembering the Pike thing, and you see

00:00:24.961 --> 00:00:29.056
this burning arcane rage in the face of this
entity. At that moment, that hesitation was all it

00:00:29.056 --> 00:00:34.038
needed. It takes the shield and almost knocks the
weapon out of your hand. You catch yourself, land

00:00:34.038 --> 00:00:41.343
on your feet-- yeah, your fingers sting a little
bit. (laughs) Worth a shot. All right, in

00:00:41.343 --> 00:00:46.482
retribution, it's going to strike at you twice.
That's a 15?

00:00:46.482 --> 00:00:48.519
SAM: That fails.

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:49.650
MATT: 21.

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:51.095
SAM: That is successful.

00:00:51.095 --> 00:00:52.547
MATT: That is seven points of slashing damage.

00:00:52.547 --> 00:00:53.547
SAM: Okay.

00:00:53.547 --> 00:00:55.968
MATT: All right. Keyleth, you're up.

00:00:55.968 --> 00:00:59.832
MARISHA: Ugh. You guys, I thought someone was
going to kill him!

00:00:59.832 --> 00:01:03.359
SAM: I tried, but he hurt my wrist really bad!

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:08.773
MARISHA: I know, because I don't want to fucking
burn any spells on this asshole.

00:01:08.773 --> 00:01:10.117
TALIESIN: Just hit him with your stick.

00:01:10.117 --> 00:01:11.316
MARISHA: Just-- ugh. God.

00:01:11.316 --> 00:01:13.248
MATT: Roll for it.

00:01:13.248 --> 00:01:17.115
MARISHA: Goddamn it, this hopefully works-- nope.

00:01:17.115 --> 00:01:18.277
TALIESIN: No! Wow!

00:01:18.277 --> 00:01:20.145
MARISHA: Nope, that didn't work. (tink)

00:01:20.145 --> 00:01:21.876
(laughter)

00:01:21.876 --> 00:01:24.663
MATT: Heavy armor on these guys. All right. Vex,
you're up.

00:01:24.663 --> 00:01:28.014
LAURA: Oh gosh. I guess I shoot him. Can I see him
to shoot him?

00:01:28.014 --> 00:01:32.011
MATT: I'll say yeah, you can see him all right.
You can move over there and get a better view a

00:01:32.011 --> 00:01:34.143
little bit. Just around this corner, off the
table.

00:01:34.143 --> 00:01:35.572
LAURA: And I'm going to Hunter's Mark him.

00:01:35.572 --> 00:01:36.442
MATT: Hunter's Mark him?

00:01:36.442 --> 00:01:37.370
LAURA: And then I'm going to shoot him.

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:38.758
MATT: Okay, go for it.

00:01:38.758 --> 00:01:48.784
LAURA: Oh gosh, I'm just so nervous about picking
the 20. No. 19?

00:01:48.784 --> 00:01:52.852
MATT: 19? The arrow hits the armor and shatters
across the side.

00:01:52.852 --> 00:01:53.905
LAURA: Shit.

00:01:53.905 --> 00:01:55.111
TRAVIS: 19?

00:01:55.111 --> 00:01:56.619
LAURA: 24.

00:01:56.619 --> 00:01:58.026
MATT: 24 does hit.

00:01:58.026 --> 00:01:58.905
LAURA: Okay.

00:01:58.905 --> 00:02:01.579
TALIESIN: Yay, you hurt it.

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:03.154
LAURA: Well, maybe.

00:02:03.154 --> 00:02:05.871
TRAVIS: That's a high AC. Because of the shield,
right?

00:02:05.871 --> 00:02:07.909
MATT: Because of the shield and the armor.

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:08.853
LAURA: 18.

00:02:08.853 --> 00:02:13.677
MATT: 18 points of damage? With that, the second
arrow strikes into the center of its chest armor.

00:02:13.677 --> 00:02:20.486
It hits some sort of core where its arcane form is
held and the reddish energy blinks out, and the armor

00:02:20.486 --> 00:02:22.500
just (impact noise) crumples to the ground.

00:02:22.581 --> 00:02:24.439
TRAVIS: That's two of them!

00:02:24.542 --> 00:02:26.114
LAURA: What's up, bitches?

00:02:26.114 --> 00:02:27.759
TRAVIS: That was tough.

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:34.305
MARISHA: Okay, I immediately turn my attention to
Cassandra. Can I do a medical check on her to make

00:02:34.305 --> 00:02:35.558
sure she's okay?

00:02:35.558 --> 00:02:37.245
MATT: Go ahead and make a medicine check, yeah.

00:02:37.245 --> 00:02:38.269
TRAVIS: Where's Ripley?

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:40.446
SAM: I start running out the hall to Ripley.

00:02:40.446 --> 00:02:41.354
TRAVIS: Me, as well.

00:02:41.354 --> 00:02:43.417
LAURA: Oh, Trinket is still running after her,
too.

00:02:43.417 --> 00:02:47.863
MATT: All right, make a perception check for
Trinket.

00:02:47.863 --> 00:02:51.298
LAURA: Oh. (laughs) Okay, is it his smelling?

00:02:51.298 --> 00:02:53.388
MATT: Yeah, it's his wisdom bonus.

00:02:53.388 --> 00:02:58.298
LAURA: I'm rolling a big dice for Trinket! Oh,
that's good. 26!

00:02:58.298 --> 00:02:59.667
MATT: 26, okay.

00:02:59.667 --> 00:03:00.839
LAURA: 25.

00:03:00.839 --> 00:03:05.072
MATT: 25, okay. Trinket is giving chase best it
can.

00:03:05.072 --> 00:03:10.382
LAURA: Except wait. Hold on, I get advantage
because he's got advantage on smell perception.

00:03:10.382 --> 00:03:12.637
Oh, it's the same thing.

00:03:12.637 --> 00:03:18.383
MATT: Okay, so Trinket is keeping track, but is
having a hard time fully keeping up at this point

00:03:18.383 --> 00:03:24.745
unless you're giving full attention towards him at
this point in time, but is keeping a track. He is

00:03:24.745 --> 00:03:28.866
rushing as fast as he can down the stairs and is
currently out of your sphere of personal influence

00:03:28.866 --> 00:03:29.938
at the moment.

00:03:29.938 --> 00:03:32.057
LAURA: I should have Hunter's Marked her. (sighs)

00:03:32.057 --> 00:03:35.850
TRAVIS: I grab Scanlan, and we're taking off 
after her out the door.

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:37.804
MARISHA: I rolled a 17 on a medicine check.

00:03:37.867 --> 00:03:46.943
MATT: Okay, checking Cassandra, there is no sign
of a wound now. She seems to be not in any

00:03:47.011 --> 00:03:48.298
danger.

00:03:48.298 --> 00:03:49.660
MARISHA: Okay.

00:03:49.762 --> 00:03:51.586
MATT: So, she's on the ground, dazed.

00:03:51.586 --> 00:03:55.896
TALIESIN: I'm going to collapse in a corner for a
minute and start using my ascot to clean some of

00:03:55.896 --> 00:04:00.534
the gore off my weapon and my clothing and my
mask.

00:04:00.534 --> 00:04:02.424
MATT: It is a lot of gore. Okay.

00:04:02.424 --> 00:04:04.096
LIAM: Are we out of combat now?

00:04:04.096 --> 00:04:05.313
MATT: You guys are currently out of combat.

00:04:05.313 --> 00:04:13.437
LIAM: Okay. I'm going to, clutching my bleeding
belly, walk over toward Keyleth and say, that was

00:04:13.437 --> 00:04:15.499
a close one.

00:04:15.499 --> 00:04:23.061
MARISHA: Yeah. You know, I feel like we've been
here before-- oh, right. We have been here

00:04:23.061 --> 00:04:25.113
before.

00:04:25.113 --> 00:04:27.862
LIAM: You know I'm in love with you, right? 
And I kiss her.

00:04:27.862 --> 00:04:29.045
SAM: Oh!

00:04:29.045 --> 00:04:33.427
TALIESIN: (coughs heavily)

00:04:33.427 --> 00:04:34.983
SAM: Persistent cough.

00:04:34.983 --> 00:04:39.352
MATT: (laughs) And on that note, we're going to go
ahead and take a quick little break!

00:04:39.352 --> 00:04:41.015
LAURA: What the fuck?!

00:04:41.015 --> 00:04:46.344
MATT: (laughs) All right, quick break!

00:04:46.344 --> 00:04:48.698
TALIESIN: I want to see what color you turned. Oh
my god, yeah!

00:04:48.698 --> 00:04:50.318
(laughter)

00:04:50.318 --> 00:04:53.604
MATT: All right, awesome. Quick break, guys! See
you guys back here in a few minutes.

00:04:53.604 --> 00:04:55.381
TRAVIS: Dude, what?!

00:04:55.381 --> 00:14:02.384
[break]

00:14:02.384 --> 00:14:06.563
ZAC: Couple quick things, guys, or I could just
sit here and talk for a good ten minutes, make you

00:14:06.563 --> 00:14:11.699
guys wait before we come back to the bombshell
that was dropped. I'm just going to keep going. We

00:14:11.699 --> 00:14:16.353
are 15 away from doing a giveaway, if we hit that
15 we will be doing that giveaway at the very end

00:14:16.353 --> 00:14:21.955
of this stream, right whenever Matt says that's
it. We will open up the chat for everyone and do

00:14:21.955 --> 00:14:25.062
that giveaway. I also want to say for all the
people wondering what in the world was the No

00:14:25.062 --> 00:14:30.448
Survivors thing, Snakes on a Plane number one was
this last Monday, and it's up on the website right

00:14:30.448 --> 00:14:33.525
now if you guys are curious and want to check it
out, it's probably the funniest thing we've ever

00:14:33.525 --> 00:14:37.861
done on this channel, and I don't say that
lightly. But we're doing Snakes on a Plane 2 this

00:14:37.861 --> 00:14:39.960
coming Monday, so thanks, guys.

00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:40.774
MATT: Hell yeah.

00:14:40.774 --> 00:14:42.717
TALIESIN: Snakes on a Plane 2: More Snakes, More
Plane.

00:14:42.717 --> 00:14:50.544
MATT: All right. So. With the chaos that has
ensued through the battle in Anders's study in the

00:14:50.544 --> 00:14:57.840
castle of Whitestone, the party looks about,
Cassandra de Rolo recovered, and pulled from

00:14:57.840 --> 00:15:06.061
seemingly the brink of death. Vax pulled seemingly
from the brink of death, and Percy managing to

00:15:06.061 --> 00:15:12.503
squeak in a second killshot on a member of his
list. As the rest period kicks in, Vax stepped

00:15:12.503 --> 00:15:17.391
across the room, holding his wound to his side,
admitting his affection for Keyleth, and reaching

00:15:17.391 --> 00:15:18.816
out and kissing her.

00:15:18.816 --> 00:15:22.043
TRAVIS: Or attempting to kiss.

00:15:22.043 --> 00:15:24.590
LAURA: Roll for contact there?

00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:26.885
SAM: Roll for tongue action.

00:15:26.885 --> 00:15:27.952
MATT: No.

00:15:27.952 --> 00:15:29.128
LIAM: No.

00:15:29.128 --> 00:15:36.617
MATT: So, as he breaks from the momentary,
unexpected embrace, you catch yourself off guard.

00:15:36.617 --> 00:15:43.611
LIAM: You know, the way you turn into animals and
stuff is really cool.

00:15:43.611 --> 00:15:47.107
TALIESIN: I'm going to collect some of Vex's
arrows.

00:15:47.107 --> 00:15:49.712
MARISHA: Are you sure you're--

00:15:49.712 --> 00:15:52.084
LAURA: I leave the room and look for Trinket.

00:15:52.084 --> 00:16:04.308
MARISHA: Just... let me. And I Cure Wounds him.
I'll do a 4th level. Shut up, Sam. I just can't

00:16:04.308 --> 00:16:08.464
find my spell. Yeah, I'll do that 4th-level Cure
Wounds.

00:16:08.464 --> 00:16:14.053
MATT: Burn all the spell slots. Go ahead and
roll.

00:16:14.053 --> 00:16:17.217
LIAM: Folks, we don't know what we're doing. None
of us know what we're doing.

00:16:17.217 --> 00:16:23.143
MARISHA: I feel like in the moment I would just do
it really at a-- shut up.

00:16:23.143 --> 00:16:24.611
SAM: Sure, overcompensate.

00:16:24.611 --> 00:16:34.896
MARISHA: Right. What do I roll? Hang on. 1d8. So
I'm rolling 4d8. I need d8s, goddamn it!

00:16:34.896 --> 00:16:35.965
Give me d8s.

00:16:35.965 --> 00:16:38.916
TALIESIN: You can't have my d8s.

00:16:38.916 --> 00:16:40.403
MARISHA: Why can't I have your d8s?

00:16:40.403 --> 00:16:41.803
TALIESIN: Okay, fine, have my d8s.

00:16:41.803 --> 00:16:43.609
MARISHA: That's fine, give me one more.

00:16:43.609 --> 00:16:45.172
MATT: All right.

00:16:45.172 --> 00:16:48.908
MARISHA: Okay, 14, 18. (counting)

00:16:48.908 --> 00:16:50.210
MATT: What are you doing?

00:16:50.210 --> 00:16:58.147
TALIESIN: I'm collecting three or four of Vex's
arrows from the ground and getting them in my

00:16:58.147 --> 00:17:03.255
hand, and I'm staying back from all of this and
letting it happen.

00:17:03.255 --> 00:17:08.711
MATT: Okay. Collect the arrows, Vex has stepped
out of the room to pursue after Trinket, Trinket

00:17:08.711 --> 00:17:12.069
is currently pursuing Ripley. Grog, you watched
that happen.

00:17:12.069 --> 00:17:14.798
TRAVIS: No, Grog and Scanlan ran out of the room
after Ripley.

00:17:14.798 --> 00:17:16.498
MATT: Okay, have you guys bolted out? Okay.

00:17:16.498 --> 00:17:17.948
TRAVIS: We're yelling out, Ripley!

00:17:17.948 --> 00:17:19.671
SAM: Ripley!

00:17:19.671 --> 00:17:21.271
TALIESIN: Vax, are you all right?

00:17:21.271 --> 00:17:23.072
SAM: We shouldn't yell, Grog.

00:17:23.072 --> 00:17:24.676
TRAVIS: Fuck that. I yell anyway.

00:17:24.676 --> 00:17:25.993
LIAM: Was there a total?

00:17:25.993 --> 00:17:26.970
MARISHA: 33.

00:17:26.970 --> 00:17:31.681
LIAM: Yes, I feel better. Thank you.

00:17:31.681 --> 00:17:36.740
TALIESIN: That's good. I'm going to now take my
handful of what is now basically a switch, and I'm

00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:39.521
going to start whacking him with it really hard on
the chest.

00:17:39.521 --> 00:17:40.701
LIAM: Who?

00:17:40.701 --> 00:17:45.257
TALIESIN: You! Don't go into rooms by yourself,
god damn it!

00:17:45.257 --> 00:17:48.733
MARISHA: I back into a corner upon seeing this, as
Percy ruins the moment.

00:17:48.733 --> 00:17:55.648
LIAM: Percival, he had a knife to your sister's
throat. He was going to kill her.

00:17:55.648 --> 00:17:59.468
TALIESIN: Thank you, but count to ten. And now I
drop them and go over to my sister.

00:17:59.468 --> 00:18:03.597
LIAM: I was afraid she was going to die.

00:18:03.597 --> 00:18:07.006
MARISHA: To be fair, you did get her throat slit,
but it's okay.

00:18:07.006 --> 00:18:12.585
MATT: As you're saying this, you turn around, you
can see she's sat up and she sees this

00:18:12.585 --> 00:18:16.446
conversation and goes, "Percy?"

00:18:16.446 --> 00:18:18.226
TALIESIN: Hi.

00:18:18.226 --> 00:18:20.789
MATT: "Percy!"

00:18:20.789 --> 00:18:22.576
TALIESIN: I'm so sorry.

00:18:22.576 --> 00:18:26.719
MATT: And she gets up off the ground and runs up
and just grabs you and embraces you tightly. You

00:18:26.719 --> 00:18:30.070
can feel all the muscles tense in her body as she
just holds you with a slight shake to her body.

00:18:30.070 --> 00:18:33.392
TALIESIN: I'm so sorry for leaving you.

00:18:33.392 --> 00:18:37.652
MATT: "I thought you were dead." She pulls away
for a second and just looks at you, and there's a

00:18:37.652 --> 00:18:46.078
coldness to her face. She's happy, but even for
her young age, you can see there's lines at the

00:18:46.078 --> 00:18:55.574
corners of her eyes. She's probably been through a
lot. She smiles and looks up at you again and you

00:18:55.574 --> 00:19:00.903
can see there's the white shocks in her hair, and
she looks up and touches your hair and goes, "I see

00:19:00.903 --> 00:19:04.595
"we've both survived quite a bit."

00:19:04.669 --> 00:19:05.941
TALIESIN: I wouldn't trade.

00:19:05.941 --> 00:19:11.797
MATT: She laughs to herself, and you see another
tear curl at her eye, and then her face goes cold

00:19:11.797 --> 00:19:18.586
for a second and she, not breaking this gaze,
steps back. "You shouldn't be here. They were

00:19:18.633 --> 00:19:20.797
"using me to get to you. I'm so sorry."

00:19:20.797 --> 00:19:24.562
TALIESIN: Are you all right? Did they do anything?
Are you yourself?

00:19:24.562 --> 00:19:33.977
MATT: She reaches up and holds her neck. "I'm
good. I'm good." And she steels herself for a

00:19:33.977 --> 00:19:39.028
second, and even more so, you see there's an
intensity to her.

00:19:39.028 --> 00:19:40.369
TALIESIN: Perception check?

00:19:40.369 --> 00:19:41.444
MATT: To...?

00:19:41.444 --> 00:19:49.864
TALIESIN: Insight. I want to make sure she's not
holding anything really important back.

00:19:49.864 --> 00:19:51.473
MATT: Okay, go for it.

00:19:51.473 --> 00:20:00.147
TALIESIN: Insight? Do I get a bonus for that right
now? It's a wisdom-- yeah!

00:20:00.147 --> 00:20:01.825
MATT: No, because you were concentrating.

00:20:01.825 --> 00:20:03.268
TALIESIN: This is not a saving throw, though.

00:20:03.268 --> 00:20:05.670
MATT: Yeah, and that's wisdom, not a saving
throw.

00:20:05.670 --> 00:20:07.605
TALIESIN: 11.

00:20:07.605 --> 00:20:19.396
MATT: 11. Okay. Best you can tell, she seems very
honest. She seems forthright. You're used to the

00:20:19.396 --> 00:20:26.402
memory of your sister being this bright-eyed,
cheerful, youngest of the bunch, and definitely a

00:20:26.402 --> 00:20:35.626
woman who sees the world with fresh eyes. These
eyes are different. They're colder. They're

00:20:35.626 --> 00:20:44.839
hardened. In ways, you're impressed; in ways,
you're also immediately sad to see that that

00:20:44.839 --> 00:20:48.261
memory of your sister probably is no longer
there.

00:20:48.261 --> 00:20:52.600
TALIESIN: We're putting an end to the Briarwoods
tonight. Before the sun sets. This is the end of

00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:59.379
them. It's all going to be over, and we're going
to stop whatever it is they're doing

00:20:59.379 --> 00:21:01.244
under the city.

00:21:01.244 --> 00:21:04.481
MATT: "You say this. We've tried twice."

00:21:04.481 --> 00:21:08.888
TALIESIN: I know. This is it.

00:21:08.888 --> 00:21:21.145
MATT: "That's what the others thought. You left
me, you know."

00:21:21.145 --> 00:21:24.136
TALIESIN: I know, and I'm so sorry.

00:21:24.136 --> 00:21:32.002
MATT: "Good. Well, if we're going to do this,
let's get ready."

00:21:32.002 --> 00:21:35.829
TALIESIN: You're going to your room.

00:21:35.829 --> 00:21:36.920
MATT: "Yes, I am."

00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:38.519
TALIESIN: To wait until this is over.

00:21:38.519 --> 00:21:47.044
MATT: "No. No, I'm not. I'm going to my room to
get my things. To get my mother's armor."

00:21:47.044 --> 00:21:54.644
TALIESIN: (sputters) You're-- I don't think that's
a very good idea.

00:21:54.644 --> 00:22:00.366
MATT: "You've been fighting them for what, a few
days? I've been fighting them for nearly three

00:22:00.366 --> 00:22:09.086
"years. You have no power over me, brother. And if
our goals are aligned to free this city, let's do

00:22:09.086 --> 00:22:12.491
"it together. But I don't have to listen to you."

00:22:12.491 --> 00:22:16.631
TALIESIN: God, you're irritating. Fine. Ugh!

00:22:16.631 --> 00:22:18.249
MATT: She walks out of the room.

00:22:18.249 --> 00:22:21.678
MARISHA: Percy!

00:22:21.678 --> 00:22:23.938
TALIESIN: She's so obnoxious. What?

00:22:23.938 --> 00:22:26.472
MARISHA: You have a sister.

00:22:26.472 --> 00:22:30.381
TALIESIN: Oh god, I do.

00:22:30.381 --> 00:22:39.289
MATT: You guys, charging off. Trinket's keeping
trail. She's run down the stairway, he is

00:22:39.289 --> 00:22:49.478
beginning to slowly gain on her. She reaches the
front doors, does remember the caltrops. Jumps

00:22:49.478 --> 00:22:55.826
over them, grabs the door, opens it, and rushes
out into the daylight. Go ahead and roll a

00:22:55.826 --> 00:22:58.149
perception check for Trinket.

00:22:58.149 --> 00:23:00.017
MARISHA: Oh, come on, Trinket.

00:23:00.017 --> 00:23:04.570
LAURA: He saw it happen! He's got really good
vision.

00:23:04.570 --> 00:23:07.612
MARISHA: Come on, Trink.

00:23:07.612 --> 00:23:08.770
TALIESIN: Yay!

00:23:08.770 --> 00:23:11.409
LAURA: Oh yeah, that's like 24.

00:23:11.409 --> 00:23:18.029
MATT: Yeah, Trinket just jumps over. The door's
only slightly open so Trinket has to stop and

00:23:18.029 --> 00:23:19.466
wedge his way through.

00:23:19.466 --> 00:23:21.657
LAURA: Can he cannonball into her? To try to catch
her?

00:23:21.657 --> 00:23:24.849
MATT: It's the same speed as if he dashed. It
would be the same speed.

00:23:24.849 --> 00:23:26.005
LAURA: All right.

00:23:26.005 --> 00:23:33.951
MATT: However, it takes a moment to get through.
You guys now get down the stairs. As Trinket opens

00:23:33.951 --> 00:23:44.607
the door and wedges through, there's a scent out
there, but she's nowhere in visible range. She's

00:23:44.666 --> 00:23:51.160
either darted off the path or possibly off the
actual sides, and you can see now the struggle

00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:58.476
that's happened. You can now hear in the distance
the sound of yells and fighting and there doesn't

00:23:58.476 --> 00:24:00.861
appear to be any one side or the other pushing.

00:24:00.861 --> 00:24:04.211
LAURA: I whistle at Trinket to get him to stop.

00:24:04.211 --> 00:24:06.617
MATT: Okay, as you get to the landing you whistle
out, and Trinket is just now pushing through the

00:24:06.617 --> 00:24:11.485
door and gets out for a bit, looking back and
forth. Looks over the shoulder, and runs back to

00:24:11.485 --> 00:24:16.834
you. It appears that Ripley has scattered into
Whitestone somewhere.

00:24:16.834 --> 00:24:18.440
SAM: Damn it.

00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:19.729
TRAVIS: We stop.

00:24:19.729 --> 00:24:21.731
MATT: Okay.

00:24:21.731 --> 00:24:24.323
LAURA: We need to find the Briarwoods.

00:24:24.323 --> 00:24:28.836
TALIESIN: I'm still upstairs. Are you going to
come meet us again upstairs?

00:24:28.836 --> 00:24:33.554
SAM: We'll get Trinket and go back upstairs,
wherever they are.

00:24:33.554 --> 00:24:36.836
TALIESIN: Taking a short rest.

00:24:36.836 --> 00:24:39.759
MARISHA: We're taking a short rest?

00:24:39.759 --> 00:24:43.767
TALIESIN: We're waiting there. They followed her
down; I'm waiting on Cassandra.

00:24:43.767 --> 00:24:46.847
TRAVIS: I could stay down in that foyer.

00:24:46.847 --> 00:24:48.084
TALIESIN: Come up.

00:24:48.084 --> 00:24:49.451
MATT: Are you waiting in the study?

00:24:49.451 --> 00:24:50.678
TALIESIN: Yeah, waiting in the study.

00:24:50.678 --> 00:24:53.962
MATT: Okay, she goes off to her room. You're there
for a few minutes.

00:24:53.962 --> 00:24:55.506
TALIESIN: Does Grog show up?

00:24:55.506 --> 00:25:06.829
SAM: We come back and say, that Ripley is very
talented. She got away. Talented Dr. Ripley.

00:25:06.829 --> 00:25:17.479
TALIESIN: We have bigger issues than Anna at this
point. Grog, do you have the Bag of Holding?

00:25:17.479 --> 00:25:18.561
TRAVIS: I do.

00:25:18.561 --> 00:25:21.986
TALIESIN: Can you scoop up what's left of
Professor Anders?

00:25:21.986 --> 00:25:28.853
LAURA: Can I loot him first? I mean, just see
what's on him.

00:25:28.853 --> 00:25:30.837
TRAVIS: Like, his head bits?

00:25:30.837 --> 00:25:36.712
TALIESIN: I don't want any of him sticking
around.

00:25:36.712 --> 00:25:38.612
MARISHA: Do we have to put him in the Bag of
Holding, though?

00:25:38.612 --> 00:25:40.262
TRAVIS: Why can't we just set him on fire?

00:25:40.262 --> 00:25:42.967
MARISHA: Yeah, stuff him in a closet or something
for now.

00:25:42.967 --> 00:25:45.579
TALIESIN: Fire will do.

00:25:45.579 --> 00:25:47.517
TRAVIS: Is there a fireplace in the room?

00:25:47.517 --> 00:25:49.622
TALIESIN: There is. Throw him in. Fine, we'll
throw him in the fire.

00:25:49.622 --> 00:25:52.463
LAURA: Wait. Let me see what's on him, first.

00:25:52.463 --> 00:25:55.090
MATT: Okay. Make an investigation check.

00:25:55.090 --> 00:25:56.714
TALIESIN: We don't want him coming back.

00:25:56.714 --> 00:26:02.177
MATT: He's crumpled up against the desk in the
corner, there's all these papers that got pushed

00:26:02.177 --> 00:26:04.931
off the side, there were a bunch of random
scrawlings.

00:26:04.931 --> 00:26:06.178
LAURA: 24.

00:26:06.178 --> 00:26:19.167
MATT: 24? Okay. You search his body. You find 120
gold pieces on him. Not a whole lot. He doesn't

00:26:19.167 --> 00:26:25.400
keep his important shit on him, for the most part.
You do find, however, the boots that he's wearing

00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:34.468
are very finely crafted, and unlike the rest of
his wear, have a hand-stitching in it that is

00:26:34.468 --> 00:26:40.562
exemplary in construction and doesn't match with
the rest of his ensemble. So it seems like

00:26:40.562 --> 00:26:44.188
something you'd wear more for function than for
actual style. Pardon.

00:26:44.188 --> 00:26:45.472
LAURA: I take them.

00:26:45.472 --> 00:26:47.152
MATT: You take them.

00:26:47.152 --> 00:26:48.319
TALIESIN: Take his shoes.

00:26:48.319 --> 00:26:49.329
MATT: Okay.

00:26:49.329 --> 00:26:52.801
LAURA: Does anybody have magic? Can you see what
these are?

00:26:52.801 --> 00:26:54.542
SAM: Sure, I can look at them.

00:26:54.542 --> 00:26:55.993
LAURA: Look at these, Scanlan.

00:26:55.993 --> 00:26:57.259
SAM: I look at them.

00:26:57.259 --> 00:27:00.894
MATT: Okay, if you're taking a short rest, you can
take the short rest to inspect the boots, get the

00:27:00.894 --> 00:27:08.319
feel for them, they are indeed enchanted. They are
a pair of Boots of Levitation. Once per day, you

00:27:08.319 --> 00:27:14.259
can trigger the levitation for up to ten minutes
as per the spell. You can't actually move as part

00:27:14.259 --> 00:27:18.474
of it, you just levitate in the air, and you have
to push off to get space.

00:27:18.474 --> 00:27:19.783
TRAVIS: So like zero-G.

00:27:19.783 --> 00:27:20.617
MATT: Zero-G.

00:27:20.617 --> 00:27:21.764
TALIESIN: Like Willy Wonka.

00:27:21.764 --> 00:27:23.402
MARISHA: Zero-G boots! Oh, hell yeah.

00:27:23.402 --> 00:27:24.749
SAM: Who do they fit?

00:27:24.749 --> 00:27:29.953
MATT: They fit anyone who wishes to put them on.
Magical items alter themselves.

00:27:29.953 --> 00:27:31.668
MARISHA: Oh, we're playing with that later.

00:27:31.668 --> 00:27:33.590
TRAVIS: I'll just hang onto it. I'll just hold
onto it.

00:27:33.590 --> 00:27:38.828
MARISHA: Can we all just try them once when we get
back to Greyskull Keep?

00:27:38.828 --> 00:27:40.603
MATT: Anything else you want to do while you're
waiting?

00:27:40.603 --> 00:27:42.608
SAM: Anything else in the room? Can I sniff around
the room and investigate?

00:27:42.608 --> 00:27:44.284
MATT: Yeah, go ahead and make an investigation
check.

00:27:44.284 --> 00:27:46.164
TRAVIS: I drag Anders over to the fireplace.

00:27:46.164 --> 00:27:47.859
LIAM: I'll look with Scanlan.

00:27:47.859 --> 00:27:49.320
SAM: 12.

00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:51.749
TRAVIS: He doesn't quite fit, so I have to snap
some joints.

00:27:51.749 --> 00:27:53.039
LIAM: 27.

00:27:53.039 --> 00:27:57.377
MATT: Okay, good. As you're looking through and
finding papers, papers and ledgers and tough

00:27:57.377 --> 00:28:04.357
discussions of old classes, untouched on the side,
you go through one of the bottom drawers, and

00:28:04.357 --> 00:28:05.559
there's a lock to it.

00:28:05.559 --> 00:28:07.083
LIAM: Well, let's unlock that.

00:28:07.083 --> 00:28:09.421
SAM: Vax, do you need my help to unlock it?

00:28:09.421 --> 00:28:11.869
LIAM: No, Shorty. Hold on. Are there any traps
in there?

00:28:11.869 --> 00:28:13.591
MATT: Make a perception check.

00:28:13.591 --> 00:28:17.511
LIAM: Oh, that is 20.

00:28:17.511 --> 00:28:19.240
MATT: It does appear to be trapped.

00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:20.648
SAM: It does appear to be trapped?

00:28:20.648 --> 00:28:23.580
LIAM: So what do I roll to undo that? Dexterity?
Lockpick?

00:28:23.580 --> 00:28:27.612
MATT: Thieves' tools, as well. So same check you
did.

00:28:27.612 --> 00:28:29.547
SAM: Oh, I can open it for you.

00:28:29.547 --> 00:28:31.824
LIAM: That's a natural 20, so that's untrapped.

00:28:31.824 --> 00:28:36.928
MATT: As part of that, you notice that this
mechanism is when it opens, if there isn't a

00:28:36.928 --> 00:28:43.243
switch underneath it held that's hidden, it will
cause a poison dart to launch out in the direction

00:28:43.243 --> 00:28:47.009
of whoever's in front of it. You hold the button,
you find it, you open it up without an issue, and

00:28:47.009 --> 00:28:51.795
you find the spring mechanism, snap it, and remove
the little poison-tipped bolt,

00:28:51.795 --> 00:28:52.941
and chuck it to the side.

00:28:52.941 --> 00:28:54.446
LAURA: No, wait. Give me that. I take it.

00:28:54.446 --> 00:28:56.739
MATT: Okay. You have a poison-tipped bolt.

00:28:56.739 --> 00:28:57.688
LAURA: Okay.

00:28:57.688 --> 00:29:00.821
MATT: For a tiny little hand-crossbow is
essentially what it is.

00:29:00.821 --> 00:29:02.609
LIAM: So now I've got to unlock it, right?

00:29:02.609 --> 00:29:03.565
MATT: Yeah.

00:29:03.565 --> 00:29:05.111
LIAM: Yeah. Hey, 20.

00:29:05.111 --> 00:29:06.320
MATT: Natural 20?

00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:07.585
LIAM: No, not a natural 20.

00:29:07.585 --> 00:29:11.114
MATT: Oh, okay. Easy enough to unlock at this
point, you get it open, you pull it open, there's

00:29:11.114 --> 00:29:13.340
a collection of letters.

00:29:13.340 --> 00:29:22.538
LIAM: Percival, come here. You're probably the
best person to know what to make of these.

00:29:22.538 --> 00:29:28.538
MATT: You glance through and inspect them, and you
take the next ten minutes or so to get the gist of

00:29:28.538 --> 00:29:36.942
these letters while Cassandra's away. Many of them
talk about a slew of things that are disconcerting

00:29:36.942 --> 00:29:42.850
to you as the information hits you, and you relay
this information to the group. Notes on the

00:29:42.850 --> 00:29:52.284
removal of key magical defenses during the
political meeting at Emon. The discussion, as in

00:29:52.284 --> 00:29:58.028
making sure that certain individuals and
safeguards that are usually made during political

00:29:58.028 --> 00:30:02.567
meetings like that were not present during that
endeavor.

00:30:02.567 --> 00:30:04.386
LAURA: Evidence is what that is!

00:30:04.386 --> 00:30:11.306
MATT: Notes on best construction methods using the
mined whitestone and repairs for the manse in the

00:30:11.363 --> 00:30:12.468
ziggurat.

00:30:12.468 --> 00:30:13.768
MARISHA and TRAVIS: The manse?

00:30:13.768 --> 00:30:15.035
SAM: As in a mansion?

00:30:15.035 --> 00:30:25.543
MATT: A manse is a place or a home; it has many
different meanings. They're warning Anders, and

00:30:25.543 --> 00:30:28.569
there are multiple letters at different periods of
time over the past few years that are warning

00:30:28.612 --> 00:30:31.447
Anders of an arrival of Seeker Asum's spies.

00:30:31.447 --> 00:30:33.029
SAM: He's a good guy.

00:30:33.029 --> 00:30:34.020
LAURA: Oh!

00:30:34.020 --> 00:30:36.236
SAM: No, he's a bad guy?

00:30:36.236 --> 00:30:41.641
MATT: There are letters talking about plotting,
diverting political attention away from Whitestone

00:30:41.641 --> 00:30:50.399
to leave it a political enigma during this period
of time. There are letters talking about planting

00:30:50.399 --> 00:30:57.500
information within Wildmount that would lead their
investigation team to believe the Briarwoods had

00:30:57.500 --> 00:30:58.700
been found dead.

00:30:58.700 --> 00:31:01.228
SAM: This is a whole paper trail!

00:31:01.228 --> 00:31:06.731
MATT: And occasionally there are mentions in a lot
of these letters that speak of, "The Undying King

00:31:06.731 --> 00:31:08.847
"shall return, we are his blood."

00:31:08.847 --> 00:31:11.777
MARISHA: Jarl? What?

00:31:11.777 --> 00:31:13.756
MATT: The Undying King shall return.

00:31:13.756 --> 00:31:15.237
LAURA: Where did she get Jarl from?

00:31:15.237 --> 00:31:16.285
MATT: We are his blood.

00:31:16.285 --> 00:31:17.398
LAURA: Oh, "we are."

00:31:17.398 --> 00:31:19.582
MARISHA: The Undying King...

00:31:19.582 --> 00:31:20.670
TALIESIN: Shall return.

00:31:20.670 --> 00:31:22.402
TALIESIN and SAM: We are his blood.

00:31:22.402 --> 00:31:23.927
MARISHA: Which is what he said.

00:31:23.927 --> 00:31:25.072
SAM: And then it says Jarl.

00:31:25.072 --> 00:31:27.173
TALIESIN: Jarl. Maybe he was dictating.

00:31:27.173 --> 00:31:28.697
MATT: The letters aren't signed.

00:31:28.697 --> 00:31:32.217
SAM: Okay? Are they all of the same hand?

00:31:32.217 --> 00:31:37.941
MATT: They are all of the same handwriting. In the
cluster, there is one completely unrelated letter

00:31:37.941 --> 00:31:42.893
that talks about business ledgers and construction
of the bridge. It appears to be a simple

00:31:42.893 --> 00:31:49.315
discussion on the future plans to construct the
bridge.

00:31:49.315 --> 00:31:50.532
SAM: Is that in the same hand?

00:31:50.532 --> 00:31:51.485
MATT: It is in the same handwriting.

00:31:51.485 --> 00:31:52.433
SAM: And is it signed?

00:31:52.433 --> 00:31:54.653
MATT: It is signed a Lord Riskel Daxio.

00:31:54.653 --> 00:31:57.354
MARISHA: What! Who? Axio?

00:31:57.354 --> 00:31:58.965
TRAVIS and SAM: Riskel Daxio.

00:31:58.965 --> 00:32:00.339
MATT: Riskel Daxio.

00:32:00.339 --> 00:32:01.745
LAURA and MARISHA: We know him!

00:32:01.745 --> 00:32:02.812
MATT: Yep.

00:32:02.812 --> 00:32:03.709
LAURA: Who is he?

00:32:03.709 --> 00:32:05.153
MATT: He's on the Council of Tal'Dorei.

00:32:05.153 --> 00:32:09.044
LAURA: (gasps) Oh, motherfucker! He's a spy.

00:32:09.044 --> 00:32:10.452
MARISHA: He's our fucking spy!

00:32:10.452 --> 00:32:15.074
MATT: He's technically also the one that helped
designate the construction of your keep and

00:32:15.074 --> 00:32:16.326
plotted the construction stuff--

00:32:16.326 --> 00:32:17.396
LAURA: Oh no.

00:32:17.396 --> 00:32:18.458
SAM: He built our keep!

00:32:18.458 --> 00:32:20.157
MARISHA: He's the construction guy, he's like our
head builder.

00:32:20.157 --> 00:32:22.754
LIAM: He could be spying on us around the keep.

00:32:22.754 --> 00:32:29.491
TALIESIN: He could have a secret entrance to our
Keep that he built and didn't tell us.

00:32:29.491 --> 00:32:30.860
LAURA: Holy moly.

00:32:30.860 --> 00:32:34.768
SAM: As soon as I see that, I go down in a crouch
and I shit-scry on our keep to

00:32:34.768 --> 00:32:36.620
see if it's still there.

00:32:36.620 --> 00:32:41.963
MARISHA: Oh my god, that's right, you did that!
And I put an elemental there. It's babysitting.

00:32:41.963 --> 00:32:43.506
MATT: Yes, you did.

00:32:43.506 --> 00:32:46.917
MARISHA: Hopefully still there. 30 days.

00:32:46.917 --> 00:32:54.186
MATT: 30 days. Glancing within the kitchen, there
doesn't appear to be much that catches your

00:32:54.186 --> 00:32:54.963
attention.

00:32:54.963 --> 00:32:56.210
TALIESIN: You shat in the kitchen?

00:32:56.210 --> 00:33:00.572
SAM: I put a mound of shit in a jar in the kitchen
and I told them, don't clean it up.

00:33:00.572 --> 00:33:03.111
MATT: Like you do.

00:33:03.111 --> 00:33:04.591
SAM: You know.

00:33:04.591 --> 00:33:05.507
LAURA: Like you do.

00:33:05.507 --> 00:33:06.999
SAM: Thursdays.

00:33:06.999 --> 00:33:11.475
TRAVIS: I've got Anders in the fireplace, and I
light the Firebrand War Hammer with the magic

00:33:11.475 --> 00:33:14.192
word, bacon, and I hit it and set him on fire.

00:33:14.192 --> 00:33:19.068
MATT: There was already a fire in the fireplace,
but you just stoke it a little further, and pretty

00:33:19.068 --> 00:33:22.252
soon the delicious scent of burning human flesh
fills the room.

00:33:22.252 --> 00:33:23.280
LAURA: Bacon?

00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:26.931
TRAVIS: Yeah, bacon. Did you not know that's what
the word was?

00:33:26.931 --> 00:33:28.929
SAM: So everything's fine at the keep?

00:33:28.929 --> 00:33:30.362
MATT: At the time.

00:33:30.362 --> 00:33:31.970
SAM: At the time, okay.

00:33:31.970 --> 00:33:35.251
MATT: At least, there's nothing on fire, there's
no screams, there's no movement. It just seems

00:33:35.251 --> 00:33:36.903
like the cold kitchen is untouched.

00:33:36.903 --> 00:33:41.270
SAM: Guys, my shit saw no movement.

00:33:41.270 --> 00:33:43.408
(laughter)

00:33:43.408 --> 00:33:46.267
LAURA: Good to know, Scanlan.

00:33:46.267 --> 00:33:49.611
TALIESIN: You've squeezed all you're going to be
able to get out of that.

00:33:49.611 --> 00:33:57.302
TRAVIS: Percy. Can we get into the underground
caverns from here?

00:33:57.302 --> 00:34:02.635
TALIESIN: Can I think of a way? I'm assuming I
know a way to where this might be.

00:34:02.635 --> 00:34:09.595
MATT: As you have this conversation, a voice from
the doorway rings out. "I can take you." You look

00:34:09.595 --> 00:34:10.981
over, and it's Cassandra.

00:34:10.981 --> 00:34:12.248
TALIESIN: She's going to take us.

00:34:12.248 --> 00:34:13.374
SAM: Is that your sister?

00:34:13.374 --> 00:34:14.298
TALIESIN: Apparently.

00:34:14.298 --> 00:34:19.905
MATT: She's currently now dressed in armor you've
seen as ornamental before. It was armor that your

00:34:19.905 --> 00:34:25.607
mother trained in when she was young, but was
unused for a long time. It seems to be

00:34:25.607 --> 00:34:31.297
serviceable; it's been updated and such. She
slides a shortsword into a sheath at her side, and

00:34:31.297 --> 00:34:36.674
her hair is pulled back and tied off, and she
looks at the rest of the room. "So are we ready?"

00:34:36.674 --> 00:34:38.586
TRAVIS: Let me see your neck.

00:34:38.586 --> 00:34:42.538
MATT: She steps up and lifts her chin up towards
you.

00:34:42.538 --> 00:34:43.888
SAM: By the way, this is Grog.

00:34:43.888 --> 00:34:45.412
LIAM: I'm going to insight check as he does that.

00:34:45.412 --> 00:34:47.093
TALIESIN: These are my friends, by the way.

00:34:47.093 --> 00:34:49.908
TRAVIS: Do I see anything on her neck?

00:34:49.908 --> 00:34:54.833
MATT: No. It seems fine. There's no signs of any
puncture wounds. Rolling?

00:34:54.833 --> 00:34:55.892
LIAM: It's a 15.

00:34:55.892 --> 00:35:01.188
MATT: Okay. She seems as determined as the rest of
you.

00:35:01.188 --> 00:35:04.414
LAURA: All right.

00:35:04.414 --> 00:35:07.620
TALIESIN: Lead the way, sister.

00:35:07.620 --> 00:35:12.915
MATT: She turns around and she begins walking back
down the hallway.

00:35:12.915 --> 00:35:16.823
LAURA: Can we expect any more traps that you're
aware of?

00:35:16.823 --> 00:35:22.402
MATT: "That I'm aware of, no, but I'm certain that
there may be. They know you're coming, it seems.

00:35:22.402 --> 00:35:26.063
"So be wary. Be careful. I'll take you to the
undercroft."

00:35:26.063 --> 00:35:27.836
LIAM: Did we just have a short rest here?

00:35:27.836 --> 00:35:28.777
MATT: You did.

00:35:28.777 --> 00:35:30.379
LIAM: Going to heal up.

00:35:30.379 --> 00:35:43.068
SAM: Hey, Percival. Any chance you can load up one
of Ripley's guns for me?

00:35:43.068 --> 00:35:50.191
TALIESIN: I don't know if it will actually-- I
would have to probably train you in

00:35:50.191 --> 00:35:51.431
how to use it.

00:35:51.431 --> 00:35:57.414
SAM: Really? I've seen you use it. You just pull
your finger on the finger part and the big boom

00:35:57.414 --> 00:35:58.727
part goes out.

00:35:58.727 --> 00:36:01.399
TALIESIN: It's a little more complicated than
that, actually.

00:36:01.399 --> 00:36:03.812
SAM: Well, you have to point it at the thing you
want to be boomed.

00:36:03.812 --> 00:36:07.400
MATT: He could use it, he just wouldn't be able to
add his proficiency bonus to the attack rolls.

00:36:07.400 --> 00:36:13.652
TALIESIN: I'll load one for you. I'll give him
her boomstick.

00:36:13.652 --> 00:36:16.375
MATT: Okay. You take it. You inspect it as you
guys are walking along.

00:36:16.375 --> 00:36:18.227
TALIESIN: Just making sure it functions, too.

00:36:18.227 --> 00:36:22.465
MATT: It seems pretty functional. It's
well-constructed, it's sleek. Your Pepperbox has a

00:36:22.465 --> 00:36:27.807
bit of flair to its design, this is your
background. Hers is just streamlined, simple, much

00:36:27.807 --> 00:36:32.791
like the decor of her room when you saw it. She
doesn't mess with anything fancy or unnecessary.

00:36:32.791 --> 00:36:39.860
The ammunition she does have are made specific to
size to her pistol. They will not function for the

00:36:39.860 --> 00:36:43.450
Pepperbox, unfortunately. They will only work for
the pistol.

00:36:43.450 --> 00:36:45.956
TALIESIN: Doing okay. Not doing great, but I'm
doing okay.

00:36:45.956 --> 00:36:51.906
MATT: It does act as a pistol for rules-wise,
which is on your sheet here, so yes, you would

00:36:51.906 --> 00:36:53.027
have that.

00:36:53.027 --> 00:36:55.061
LAURA: Do you want it? Just in case yours
misfires?

00:36:55.061 --> 00:36:57.628
TALIESIN: I'll steal it back from him if I need,
but it should be fine.

00:36:57.628 --> 00:37:04.935
SAM: I'd like to make an athletics check.
Athletics. See if I can spin it around and put it

00:37:04.935 --> 00:37:06.263
in my pocket.

00:37:06.263 --> 00:37:08.782
LAURA: Wait, where did you get it? I had it in my
belt.

00:37:08.782 --> 00:37:10.133
TALIESIN: No, if you have it.

00:37:10.133 --> 00:37:11.026
LAURA: I have it.

00:37:11.026 --> 00:37:12.031
SAM: Okay, give it to me.

00:37:12.031 --> 00:37:13.106
TALIESIN: Give it to him.

00:37:13.106 --> 00:37:14.759
MARISHA: Put your eye out.

00:37:14.759 --> 00:37:18.000
MATT: All right. Go ahead and roll dexterity, roll
a d20, add your dexterity modifier.

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:19.313
LIAM: Don't roll a one.

00:37:19.313 --> 00:37:23.275
TALIESIN: This is literally how she lost her
hand.

00:37:23.275 --> 00:37:26.770
SAM: Wait, what's this? Why does it say plus
four?

00:37:26.770 --> 00:37:28.884
LAURA: This music is awful as you're checking.

00:37:28.884 --> 00:37:30.926
MARISHA: Yeah, the violins plinking.

00:37:30.926 --> 00:37:34.482
SAM: Well, it's zero, but it says a big plus four
next to it for some reason.

00:37:34.595 --> 00:37:39.178
MATT: I don't know. Add zero. What did you roll?

00:37:39.178 --> 00:37:40.445
SAM: It was 14.

00:37:40.445 --> 00:37:45.779
MATT: Okay. You manage to get it in there.
Thankfully it's not loaded, because you feel the

00:37:45.779 --> 00:37:49.514
trigger go off. But there wasn't a bullet loaded,
so it's like (click).

00:37:49.514 --> 00:37:51.050
TRAVIS: Yeah, we took out the ammunition.

00:37:51.050 --> 00:37:52.666
SAM: Okay, now give me a bullet.

00:37:52.666 --> 00:37:56.732
TRAVIS: Maybe don't do that.

00:37:56.732 --> 00:38:01.555
TALIESIN: I hand him the ammunition. I load four
of them.

00:38:01.555 --> 00:38:02.835
SAM: Yeah!

00:38:02.835 --> 00:38:04.839
LAURA: Giving him a loaded gun?

00:38:04.839 --> 00:38:07.243
SAM: I'm a big boy. Well, I'm a little boy. But
I'm a little big boy.

00:38:07.243 --> 00:38:10.758
LIAM: I would like to walk past Scanlan and grab
it out of his hand.

00:38:10.758 --> 00:38:13.104
SAM: I will prevent him from doing that!

00:38:13.104 --> 00:38:14.109
MATT: Okay.

00:38:14.109 --> 00:38:16.527
MARISHA: You guys are fighting over a loaded gun.

00:38:16.527 --> 00:38:18.756
MATT: Sleight-of-hand check. Athletics check.

00:38:18.756 --> 00:38:23.985
LIAM: You go first.

00:38:23.985 --> 00:38:26.055
SAM: Is this a skill check?

00:38:26.055 --> 00:38:28.245
MATT: Yeah. Add your athletics to your roll.

00:38:28.245 --> 00:38:29.472
SAM: 17!

00:38:29.472 --> 00:38:31.440
LIAM: Shut up. 27.

00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:35.941
MATT: As you go to be, "No, what are you--" It's
already gone. You don't even know where it went,

00:38:35.941 --> 00:38:38.487
you didn't see him take it, you just all of a
sudden see it in his hand as he walks past you.

00:38:38.487 --> 00:38:43.667
LIAM: And I walk over to Cassandra. I don't give
her the gun, I just say, you're Cassandra?

00:38:43.667 --> 00:38:44.608
MATT: "Yes."

00:38:44.608 --> 00:38:50.488
LIAM: I was at the door. He had a knife to your
throat. He wanted you to say something to us. What

00:38:50.488 --> 00:38:51.815
did he want you to say?

00:38:51.815 --> 00:38:57.021
MATT: "He wanted me to shout for help. He wanted
me to draw you in."

00:38:57.021 --> 00:38:59.892
LAURA: Can I insight check her to see if she's
telling the truth?

00:38:59.892 --> 00:39:00.860
MATT: Yeah.

00:39:00.860 --> 00:39:07.020
LIAM: You've been living here. How did it come
that he had a blade to your throat today? How did

00:39:07.020 --> 00:39:08.886
it all unravel? Have you been living here?

00:39:08.886 --> 00:39:09.954
LAURA: 24.

00:39:09.954 --> 00:39:11.934
MATT: 24. She's telling the truth.

00:39:11.934 --> 00:39:13.644
LAURA: Okay. That's good.

00:39:13.644 --> 00:39:23.418
MATT: "Well, after the arrows felled me-- I guess
I should start at the beginning." And she's

00:39:23.418 --> 00:39:27.504
walking along with you guys as she's leading you
down the stairs and down to the bottom floor. She

00:39:27.504 --> 00:39:30.436
doesn't look to you. She's still looking ahead,
very intent.

00:39:30.436 --> 00:39:32.980
LAURA: I take that pistol back from you.

00:39:32.980 --> 00:39:41.369
MATT: "After the arrows felled me, I recovered.
Father Reynal found me. Brought me from the brink

00:39:41.369 --> 00:39:51.051
"at the temple of Pelor outside of town. Things
hadn't fallen quite that far back then. We had

00:39:51.051 --> 00:39:58.720
"more people in the city. At the time, the
Briarwood rule was fresh and folks were eager to

00:39:58.720 --> 00:40:02.931
"speak out against what they had wrought on this
city, the fall of the de Rolos.

00:40:02.931 --> 00:40:07.252
"We still thought they had fallen to plague, but
through some unfortunate political business, they

00:40:07.252 --> 00:40:13.322
"had come to power, but we began to question it. I
knew better. I told the truth once I'd recovered.

00:40:13.322 --> 00:40:22.932
"We began to build our first rebellion. Two years
we built up the resistance before we made our

00:40:22.976 --> 00:40:32.886
"first move. They seemed to know exactly what we
were plotting. Cut us off at every angle.

00:40:33.009 --> 00:40:43.480
"Couldn't see who it was who was giving up our
information, but I knew it was close. But before I

00:40:43.480 --> 00:40:51.563
"had the opportunity, I was helming a group that
was traveling to utilize the escape route that I

00:40:51.606 --> 00:41:00.672
"took you through when they first attacked. It was
just after dusk, and Lord Briarwood was there

00:41:00.672 --> 00:41:13.539
"waiting for us in the forest. He slaughtered most
of the men, but he recognized my face from the

00:41:13.539 --> 00:41:17.808
"dinner we had the night they took the castle.

00:41:17.808 --> 00:41:33.155
"They did not harm me, strangely. They treated me
like a guest against my will, in my own house. I

00:41:33.155 --> 00:41:40.648
"seemed to ascertain that by keeping me there,
having a member of the house within their grasp,

00:41:40.648 --> 00:41:42.810
"they could use that as leverage. I don't know.

00:41:42.856 --> 00:41:50.517
"Sylas, he had his charms, and there were many
that worked beneath them against their own will.

00:41:50.517 --> 00:42:03.932
"It did not work on me. My hatred was too strong.
So instead, they tried to provide me with wealth.

00:42:03.932 --> 00:42:15.272
"Power, here in Whitestone. I just took to reading
and ignoring it all. I don't know why they kept me

00:42:15.272 --> 00:42:21.650
"around, but I wasn't going to question it if it
gave me a chance to possibly undermine them."

00:42:21.650 --> 00:42:28.159
She grabs the side of her sword as you guys have
now reached now down the long hallway towards the

00:42:28.159 --> 00:42:32.407
back of the castle. You know the direction she's
taking you. It leads to the cellar, to the

00:42:32.407 --> 00:42:35.546
undercroft and the de Rolo mausoleum.

00:42:35.546 --> 00:42:49.329
"Three years of reading in that library. Father's
library. Strategy. Tactics. Old lines of

00:42:49.329 --> 00:42:58.620
"information, as well as the myths and history of
Whitestone. I found allies within the castle. I

00:42:58.620 --> 00:43:03.770
"contacted Yennen, and through him, Archibald, who
helped me build the first rebellion.

00:43:03.770 --> 00:43:14.743
"Archibald still lives, Percy. He's been
completely necessary for what we've built here."

00:43:14.743 --> 00:43:23.747
She looks down at her armor as you guys reach the
edge of the cellar, and she pulls the door open

00:43:23.747 --> 00:43:33.993
quietly. There's wooden stairs that lead down into
the cellar. She taps her armor. "This was

00:43:33.993 --> 00:43:39.443
"Mother's. It's good to know I'm not the only
tomboy in the bloodline." Brushes the hair out of

00:43:39.443 --> 00:43:42.939
her face, and for the first time really looks at
you with a smile since she first saw you.

00:43:42.939 --> 00:44:00.620
TALIESIN: (sighs) Can we do one thing before we go
down into the cellar? This is the best day of my

00:44:00.620 --> 00:44:06.995
life, and I can't help but be suspicious.

00:44:06.995 --> 00:44:09.789
MATT: "I completely understand."

00:44:09.789 --> 00:44:18.918
TALIESIN: Is there any way to check if she's being
controlled?

00:44:18.918 --> 00:44:21.323
TRAVIS: I was thinking the same thing.

00:44:21.323 --> 00:44:22.978
TALIESIN: Can we put your helmet on her?

00:44:22.978 --> 00:44:31.102
MATT: The only thing you really have seen work is
the Greater Restoration spell you cast on Seeker

00:44:31.144 --> 00:44:36.818
Asum when you guys were with the Council of
Tal'Dorei. That did seem to remove any sort of

00:44:36.818 --> 00:44:38.527
charm effects, if that's what you're asking.

00:44:38.527 --> 00:44:39.996
LAURA: We don't have that?

00:44:39.996 --> 00:44:47.521
MARISHA: I didn't learn it. Not for today. I
thought Pike's magic would hold up.

00:44:47.521 --> 00:44:50.092
TRAVIS: I can try and jog her memory.

00:44:50.092 --> 00:44:54.561
MATT: "What can I do to make you trust me?"

00:44:54.561 --> 00:44:55.884
SAM: Punch her in the face?

00:44:55.884 --> 00:44:58.576
TALIESIN: I do trust you. That's the problem.

00:44:58.576 --> 00:45:03.112
MATT: She smiles a little. "Whatever you need."

00:45:03.112 --> 00:45:10.240
TALIESIN: I've got nothing. (sighs)

00:45:10.240 --> 00:45:18.653
MATT: Does anyone have any creative means with
which they would want to check?

00:45:18.695 --> 00:45:21.624
TALIESIN: What would happen if we put your helmet
on her?

00:45:21.624 --> 00:45:24.689
MARISHA: If she's already controlled--

00:45:24.689 --> 00:45:26.784
TALIESIN: This would disrupt it, maybe.

00:45:26.784 --> 00:45:30.359
MARISHA: We could try it. It doesn't hurt to put a
hat on.

00:45:30.359 --> 00:45:33.077
LAURA: It has to be attuned over a short rest,
though.

00:45:33.077 --> 00:45:34.270
MARISHA: It does.

00:45:34.270 --> 00:45:36.464
TALIESIN: Does the hat need to be attuned over a
short rest?

00:45:36.464 --> 00:45:37.762
MATT: In theory.

00:45:37.762 --> 00:45:45.840
LIAM: I want to suggest something to you. We rest
here for a half hour, and I give this to you. This

00:45:45.840 --> 00:46:01.841
came from a very strange creature. It will help
you resist any control, if there is any control,

00:46:01.887 --> 00:46:10.271
and one of us-- you could even choose-- could
strike you and try to take you out of it, and if

00:46:10.271 --> 00:46:14.860
you are not being controlled, then you are being
struck across the face, and I'm sorry for that,

00:46:14.938 --> 00:46:22.765
but if you are, there's a possibility we'd pull
you out. I know that would hurt, but it would go a

00:46:22.765 --> 00:46:24.799
long way to earn our trust.

00:46:24.799 --> 00:46:33.348
MATT: "If that's what it takes." She takes it from
your hand and inspects it for a second. "Shoddy

00:46:33.348 --> 00:46:38.375
"craftsmanship." Places it on her head, and it's a
little big at first,

00:46:38.375 --> 00:46:40.319
then it conforms to her head.

00:46:40.319 --> 00:46:42.833
LIAM: Your choice.

00:46:42.833 --> 00:46:48.577
MATT: She sits down a couple of steps deeper into
the cellar. Curls around a corner; ushers you all

00:46:48.577 --> 00:46:50.124
over into the shadows.

00:46:50.124 --> 00:46:52.376
MARISHA: Can I see, before we leave, are we near
any windows?

00:46:52.376 --> 00:47:01.940
MATT: From this location? No. All the windows that
would be here would face out into the north side

00:47:01.940 --> 00:47:03.288
of Whitestone, which is forested.

00:47:03.288 --> 00:47:04.354
MARISHA: Backyard?

00:47:04.354 --> 00:47:06.987
MATT: You guys are on the north side of the castle
now. The city is south from you.

00:47:06.987 --> 00:47:08.446
MARISHA: All right.

00:47:08.446 --> 00:47:17.131
MATT: So you take a moment and sit. While you guys
are waiting, she takes a moment. She's adjusting

00:47:17.131 --> 00:47:24.563
it and feeling it and inspecting her hands.
(sighs) "I don't feel any different.

00:47:24.598 --> 00:47:26.297
"While we wait--"

00:47:26.297 --> 00:47:28.744
LIAM: What if the little one struck you?

00:47:28.784 --> 00:47:30.838
SAM: Struck her?

00:47:30.838 --> 00:47:33.263
LAURA: Give it some time.

00:47:33.263 --> 00:47:36.356
MATT: She gives a wry grin. "Whatever you
choose."

00:47:36.356 --> 00:47:40.136
SAM: I could try to tell if she's evil or not.
Would that help?

00:47:40.136 --> 00:47:41.077
LAURA: Yeah.

00:47:41.077 --> 00:47:45.590
LIAM: I don't know. I don't think she's evil. She
could be a puppet.

00:47:45.590 --> 00:47:56.726
MARISHA: Can I try this? This is a long shot. My--
actually, our fey ancestry, from being half-elves.

00:47:56.726 --> 00:48:03.456
We're immune to charm effects. Or we have
resistance.

00:48:03.456 --> 00:48:04.856
LIAM: Resistant to it.

00:48:04.856 --> 00:48:14.386
MARISHA: Advantage against saves. Since we have
that, can we use our fey ancestry, the three of

00:48:14.386 --> 00:48:18.005
us, to tap into her and see if we can detect a
charm?

00:48:18.005 --> 00:48:22.750
MATT: Your resistance doesn't make you attuned to
it. Unfortunately, it's just a natural ability

00:48:22.750 --> 00:48:27.828
that's inherent. Her being human, there's not a
way to really correlate with that. I mean, you've

00:48:27.828 --> 00:48:30.486
read over her a few times, doing insight checks.

00:48:30.486 --> 00:48:32.446
TALIESIN: Wait, it was Greater Restoration?

00:48:32.446 --> 00:48:33.347
MARISHA and LAURA: Yeah.

00:48:33.347 --> 00:48:34.466
TALIESIN: Ah!

00:48:34.466 --> 00:48:37.906
SAM: You have that?

00:48:37.906 --> 00:48:41.623
TALIESIN: I have a potion. This should solve all
of our problems.

00:48:41.623 --> 00:48:44.465
SAM: Or you could save that for when one of us
becomes a vampire.

00:48:44.465 --> 00:48:49.998
TALIESIN: No, it will be-- And I'm pulling out a
potion bottle. This is if you are controlled.

00:48:49.998 --> 00:48:51.980
This could fix it.

00:48:51.980 --> 00:48:57.336
MATT: She puts her hand out. Her leather glove's
pulled over it now. You've never seen her militant

00:48:57.336 --> 00:49:00.559
before, and it's a really interesting visual to
you.

00:49:00.559 --> 00:49:02.132
TALIESIN: I look at her.

00:49:02.132 --> 00:49:16.930
MATT: She drinks the potion. Whole thing down.
(coughs)

00:49:16.930 --> 00:49:19.575
TALIESIN: That was actually a minor healing
potion. I was just seeing if you did it

00:49:19.575 --> 00:49:20.747
intentionally.

00:49:20.747 --> 00:49:22.970
(laughter)

00:49:22.970 --> 00:49:27.502
MATT: She gives a wry grin and wipes her mouth. "I
thought I recognized that terrible earthy taste."

00:49:27.502 --> 00:49:30.008
She tosses the crystal decanter to you.

00:49:30.008 --> 00:49:31.521
LIAM: Clever boy.

00:49:31.521 --> 00:49:35.102
MATT: "Huh. You always were the clever one."

00:49:35.102 --> 00:49:41.987
TALIESIN: I figured it was worth a shot. Best
we're going to do.

00:49:41.987 --> 00:49:43.775
SAM: Am I supposed to punch her in the face now?

00:49:43.775 --> 00:49:44.750
LIAM: No.

00:49:44.750 --> 00:49:46.933
MATT: "Do you need this thing?"

00:49:46.933 --> 00:49:48.234
LIAM: I'll take it back, yeah.

00:49:48.234 --> 00:49:49.449
MATT: She hands it back to you.

00:49:49.449 --> 00:49:51.214
TALIESIN: All right.

00:49:51.214 --> 00:50:00.148
MATT: There's a fascination she has with her
armor. "I've not been able to wear this before. It

00:50:00.148 --> 00:50:02.721
"feels good to have something close to Mother."

00:50:02.721 --> 00:50:05.977
TALIESIN: It's been a long time. (sighs)

00:50:05.977 --> 00:50:13.259
MATT: "Simon repaired it for me when he was
working here. I haven't seen him in a while. I'm

00:50:13.259 --> 00:50:14.655
"worried."

00:50:14.655 --> 00:50:18.656
TALIESIN: Let's go down and take care of this.
Cass?

00:50:18.656 --> 00:50:22.592
MATT: She leads you down through the cellar--

00:50:22.592 --> 00:50:26.996
MARISHA: Wait, hang on. Before we enter: it's safe
to assume they know we're coming, correct?

00:50:26.996 --> 00:50:27.955
SAM: If they're there.

00:50:27.955 --> 00:50:29.293
LAURA: Yeah.

00:50:29.293 --> 00:50:30.155
TALIESIN: Yeah.

00:50:30.155 --> 00:50:32.730
LIAM: Better safe than sorry.

00:50:32.730 --> 00:50:38.880
SAM: Can I ask Cassandra--

00:50:38.880 --> 00:50:41.314
MATT: You can ask her anything you'd like.

00:50:41.314 --> 00:50:45.647
SAM: Are the Briarwoods going to be down there?
Are they here?

00:50:45.647 --> 00:50:50.210
MATT: She goes, "I have no confirmation of it, but
they spend most of their time down here. They're

00:50:50.210 --> 00:50:51.608
"preparing for something."

00:50:51.608 --> 00:50:53.236
LIAM: Have you ever been down here?

00:50:53.236 --> 00:50:58.341
MATT: "I'm not allowed down here, by their orders,
but I've snuck down a few times out of curiosity.

00:50:58.341 --> 00:51:06.196
"I've only gotten so far before I had to return,
but I've made it through the undercroft, through

00:51:06.196 --> 00:51:12.413
"most of the tunnels, and I've gotten to the
distillery, and that's about as far as I've

00:51:12.413 --> 00:51:17.250
"gotten. But I've followed them down here, and they
usually come with a group of guards,

00:51:17.250 --> 00:51:19.741
"four or five strong."

00:51:19.741 --> 00:51:22.415
LAURA: All right.

00:51:22.415 --> 00:51:26.045
TRAVIS: Are there sentries? Can we expect to find
traps, lookouts?

00:51:26.045 --> 00:51:30.874
MATT: "It's definitely a possibility, so move
quietly. Be careful."

00:51:30.940 --> 00:51:33.453
LAURA: What is Lady Briarwood?

00:51:33.453 --> 00:51:41.540
MATT: "What is Lady Briarwood? She's a wicked
beast of a creature, is what she is. I'd use less

00:51:41.540 --> 00:51:44.062
"savory words, but my brother's here."

00:51:44.062 --> 00:51:47.050
TALIESIN: There's a first time for everything, I
suppose.

00:51:47.050 --> 00:51:56.483
MATT: As she leads you guys down the stairs
towards the undercroft, she goes, "She's not like

00:51:56.483 --> 00:52:07.609
"her husband. That I know. As far as I can tell,
she's human, but she has a very powerful control

00:52:07.609 --> 00:52:13.911
"over life and death. She's a practitioner of the
arcane, definitely, but her focus seems to be

00:52:13.911 --> 00:52:23.520
"necromancy on a wide scale. And while Delilah and
Sylas are man and wife, they speak of another."

00:52:23.556 --> 00:52:26.787
SAM: They speak of another?

00:52:26.787 --> 00:52:29.116
LAURA: The guy that they're trying to bring back.

00:52:29.116 --> 00:52:31.739
MATT: "It's as if a third party completes their
union."

00:52:31.783 --> 00:52:34.365
SAM: Oh, this is the king that will rise again?

00:52:34.365 --> 00:52:40.694
MATT: "They don't say any names. They refer to him
as 'him' or 'The Whispered One.' No reference

00:52:40.694 --> 00:52:41.882
"beyond that."

00:52:41.882 --> 00:52:43.081
LAURA: (gasps)

00:52:43.081 --> 00:52:44.199
SAM: What?

00:52:44.199 --> 00:52:46.209
LAURA: (whispering) What if it's the guy in
Percy?

00:52:46.209 --> 00:52:47.041
SAM: What if it's what?

00:52:47.041 --> 00:52:48.276
TALIESIN: I'm having that thought, as well.

00:52:48.276 --> 00:52:49.847
LAURA: Percy's smoke monster.

00:52:49.847 --> 00:52:50.989
SAM: Oh shit.

00:52:50.989 --> 00:52:52.013
MARISHA: Oh boy.

00:52:52.013 --> 00:52:55.914
LIAM: He's playing both sides, possibly,
Percival.

00:52:55.914 --> 00:53:02.878
SAM: Oh, another question for Cassandra. The duke,
Negmeyer? Vegmeyer? Venkman?

00:53:02.878 --> 00:53:04.511
TALIESIN and MARISHA: Quagmire.

00:53:04.511 --> 00:53:06.865
MATT: "Vedmeyer, yes."

00:53:06.907 --> 00:53:10.449
SAM: Vedmeyer. Have you seen him around the castle
today, or recently?

00:53:10.449 --> 00:53:13.357
MATT: "I've only seen him in the castle maybe
three times since we've been here."

00:53:13.357 --> 00:53:16.860
SAM: Because Grog? He's a goliath.

00:53:16.860 --> 00:53:18.320
TRAVIS: He's-- wait, what?

00:53:18.320 --> 00:53:23.394
SAM: He's a big goliath, so if he's here, you
should just, you know--

00:53:23.394 --> 00:53:24.759
TRAVIS: How did you see him?

00:53:24.759 --> 00:53:30.131
SAM: Oh, when I was a dinosaur and I burned down a
house and killed a bunch of people...

00:53:30.131 --> 00:53:33.949
TALIESIN: That's a series of words that I know
individually, but he strings them together in ways

00:53:33.949 --> 00:53:35.271
that don't make any sense.

00:53:35.271 --> 00:53:38.910
SAM: I wouldn't say fought, because I beat him
really easily, and then I ran away.

00:53:38.910 --> 00:53:40.174
TRAVIS: Oh, you killed him?

00:53:40.174 --> 00:53:46.267
SAM: No, I just pushed him off a building, then I
thought that was enough for the day,

00:53:46.267 --> 00:53:47.579
so I went home.

00:53:47.579 --> 00:53:54.238
MATT: Cassandra looks over her shoulder at this.
"It's a shame you're not as tall as your tales,

00:53:54.238 --> 00:53:55.291
"small one."

00:53:55.291 --> 00:53:58.928
SAM: Well, thank you. I'll take that as a
compliment.

00:53:58.928 --> 00:54:00.195
TALIESIN: No!

00:54:00.195 --> 00:54:01.714
SAM: Don't worry.

00:54:01.714 --> 00:54:03.442
MARISHA: (laughing) No.

00:54:03.442 --> 00:54:05.306
(laughter)

00:54:05.306 --> 00:54:09.721
SAM: Before we cross the precipice into this--
what is it, undercroft?

00:54:09.721 --> 00:54:11.381
MATT: Undercroft she was referring to, yes.

00:54:11.381 --> 00:54:18.757
SAM: Percival, we all have fought with you this
whole time, and you know that we have your back

00:54:18.757 --> 00:54:23.683
and that we're with you in this 100 percent. But
I'd like our enemies to know that, as well, so

00:54:23.683 --> 00:54:29.864
with your permission, I will cast Seeming on all
of us. And I make the girls look like Cassandra,

00:54:29.864 --> 00:54:34.999
and the boys look like Percy. So I give us all the
gray hair.

00:54:34.999 --> 00:54:37.691
TALIESIN: You crazy motherfucker!

00:54:37.691 --> 00:54:44.611
SAM: And if possible, I'd like to emblazon the
sign of the rebellion on our chests in sort of an

00:54:44.611 --> 00:54:47.231
awesome Superman glowing thing.

00:54:47.231 --> 00:54:59.841
MATT: With a flicker of Scanlan's arcane mastery,
all of you form into a small battalion of Percys

00:54:59.841 --> 00:55:01.144
and Cassandras.

00:55:01.144 --> 00:55:02.574
LIAM: Is he a big Percy?

00:55:02.574 --> 00:55:08.406
MATT: He would have to be, yeah, because he still
stays similar to his actual size, so if Percy was

00:55:08.406 --> 00:55:10.012
a little thicker and a little taller--

00:55:10.012 --> 00:55:11.175
MARISHA: Percy's been hitting the 'roids.

00:55:11.175 --> 00:55:12.186
MATT: Yep.

00:55:12.186 --> 00:55:14.303
LAURA: What is Trinket?

00:55:14.303 --> 00:55:17.606
SAM: A bear with two streaks of white hair.

00:55:17.606 --> 00:55:19.127
(all laugh)

00:55:19.127 --> 00:55:21.831
LAURA: And he's wearing little circle glasses.

00:55:21.831 --> 00:55:26.117
SAM: Yeah, with the little glasses. We are all de
Rolos today.

00:55:26.117 --> 00:55:27.565
MARISHA: He's a Hello Trinket!

00:55:27.565 --> 00:55:29.413
TALIESIN: Hello Trinket?

00:55:29.413 --> 00:55:30.436
MARISHA: Hello Trinket.

00:55:30.436 --> 00:55:40.616
MATT: Cassandra looks around very confused for a
second. "Curious, yes."

00:55:40.616 --> 00:55:45.881
MARISHA: But abrasive. Right? You're put off by
it, so it works. It's working.

00:55:45.881 --> 00:55:47.118
SAM: Possibly confused.

00:55:47.118 --> 00:55:49.369
TALIESIN: Abrasiveness is his most powerful
weapon.

00:55:49.369 --> 00:55:57.484
MATT: "So I'm beginning to see. Well, then." She
pulls her shortsword out. "Shall we?"

00:55:57.484 --> 00:56:00.013
LAURA: Are we going in to fight now?

00:56:00.013 --> 00:56:01.651
TRAVIS: We're going into the cavern.

00:56:01.651 --> 00:56:02.840
LAURA: I'm stealthing.

00:56:02.840 --> 00:56:06.903
MATT: "As are we all." Everyone roll stealth
checks.

00:56:06.903 --> 00:56:11.149
LAURA: Should I cast Pass Without a Trace? Yeah,
I'm going to use Pass Without a Trace, because I

00:56:11.149 --> 00:56:12.764
don't have a lot of 2nd-level spells.

00:56:12.764 --> 00:56:13.767
MATT: Okay.

00:56:13.767 --> 00:56:15.024
TALIESIN: Oh yeah. Please.

00:56:15.024 --> 00:56:15.878
MATT: Plus ten.

00:56:15.878 --> 00:56:17.076
LAURA: Yeah, plus ten to your stealth.

00:56:17.076 --> 00:56:17.877
SAM: Oh, really?

00:56:17.877 --> 00:56:18.661
LAURA: Yeah.

00:56:18.661 --> 00:56:19.421
TALIESIN: Thank god.

00:56:19.421 --> 00:56:20.125
TRAVIS: Boom!

00:56:20.125 --> 00:56:21.196
LAURA: Natural 20!

00:56:21.196 --> 00:56:22.231
LIAM: You're welcome.

00:56:22.231 --> 00:56:24.870
TRAVIS: 26. Natural 20.

00:56:24.870 --> 00:56:26.601
LIAM: 30. Natural 20.

00:56:26.601 --> 00:56:29.405
LAURA: Oh, natural 20.

00:56:29.405 --> 00:56:31.065
MATT: 30, plus whatever your bonus is.

00:56:31.065 --> 00:56:32.849
LIAM: That's with the bonus.

00:56:32.849 --> 00:56:35.303
MATT: I thought you rolled a natural 20?

00:56:35.303 --> 00:56:36.700
LAURA: That's 29, that's 39.

00:56:36.700 --> 00:56:37.916
MATT: Oh, you?

00:56:37.916 --> 00:56:39.229
LAURA: 39 for me.

00:56:39.229 --> 00:56:40.894
MATT: 39? Your sister just out-stealthed you.

00:56:40.894 --> 00:56:42.349
LIAM: I gave her my fucking cloak, Matt.

00:56:42.349 --> 00:56:44.287
SAM: Do we all get plus ten?

00:56:44.287 --> 00:56:45.162
TALIESIN: Yeah.

00:56:45.162 --> 00:56:46.235
SAM: Oh, then 29.

00:56:46.235 --> 00:56:47.459
MARISHA: 28.

00:56:47.459 --> 00:56:48.521
TALIESIN: 21.

00:56:48.521 --> 00:56:52.129
MATT: You all (whoosh) vanish.

00:56:52.129 --> 00:56:55.461
MARISHA: Before we go in, I go, Vax?

00:56:55.461 --> 00:56:58.335
LAURA: How do you know it's him?

00:56:58.335 --> 00:57:00.863
MATT: Solid point.

00:57:00.863 --> 00:57:01.984
MARISHA: Vax?

00:57:01.984 --> 00:57:03.600
SAM: Yes, it's me.

00:57:03.600 --> 00:57:04.646
TALIESIN: Yes, Keyleth?

00:57:04.646 --> 00:57:05.621
MARISHA: Vax?

00:57:05.621 --> 00:57:08.409
(laughter)

00:57:08.409 --> 00:57:17.623
SAM: Yes, it's me, Vax. What do you need? It's
me.

00:57:17.623 --> 00:57:19.051
LIAM: Kiki, I'm over here.

00:57:19.051 --> 00:57:20.571
MARISHA: Goddamn it, Scanlan!

00:57:20.571 --> 00:57:27.901
LAURA: This is really creepy because it's brother
and sister talking to each other right now. It

00:57:27.901 --> 00:57:29.966
looks like Percival and Cassandra.

00:57:29.966 --> 00:57:32.954
MATT: She's very uncomfortable right now, by the
way.

00:57:32.954 --> 00:57:36.725
TALIESIN: Is there anybody who is not made
uncomfortable by this?

00:57:36.725 --> 00:57:41.325
MARISHA: This was supposed to be a passing
comment, and it's turned into a thing. (laughs)

00:57:41.325 --> 00:57:49.877
Be careful.

00:57:49.877 --> 00:57:51.357
TALIESIN: Of course, Keyleth.

00:57:51.357 --> 00:57:52.408
LAURA: He will be.

00:57:52.408 --> 00:57:55.657
MARISHA: God damn it! I can't do this anymore.

00:57:55.657 --> 00:57:56.650
TALIESIN: Carry on.

00:57:56.650 --> 00:58:00.150
MARISHA: Just go. Let's go. Can we go?

00:58:00.150 --> 00:58:04.486
SAM: Sister Vex? Do you mind giving me that gun
again?

00:58:04.524 --> 00:58:06.293
MARISHA: Shut up, Scanlan.

00:58:06.293 --> 00:58:08.188
TALIESIN: It will be no problem at all.

00:58:08.188 --> 00:58:09.689
LAURA: No, you can't have it.

00:58:09.689 --> 00:58:11.617
SAM: Why, because I'm three feet tall?

00:58:11.617 --> 00:58:13.352
LAURA: Because I want it.

00:58:13.352 --> 00:58:16.009
LIAM: (imitating Grog) Is this the body-switching
episode?

00:58:16.009 --> 00:58:19.669
TALIESIN: Right.

00:58:19.669 --> 00:58:20.843
SAM: Let's go.

00:58:20.843 --> 00:58:21.696
TALIESIN: Let's go.

00:58:21.696 --> 00:58:28.063
MATT: Continuing down, a long set of
whitestone-constructed stairs descend for about 45

00:58:28.063 --> 00:58:40.079
feet before they level off into the de Rolo
mausoleum. A long hallway continues forward that

00:58:40.079 --> 00:58:48.194
contains two ten-by-ten stone structures that
contain the entombed bodies of previous

00:58:48.194 --> 00:58:54.325
generations of de Rolos, with six passages-- three
on each side-- that split off of this main hallway

00:58:54.325 --> 00:59:03.770
that contain their own stone-encapsulated corpses.
This is a place of silent prayer and showing

00:59:03.770 --> 00:59:09.356
appreciation for the previous families. Not all of
them are full, and there were extensions planned

00:59:09.356 --> 00:59:17.411
as the family grew, but the first thing you notice
is all of the tomb doors are open.

00:59:17.411 --> 00:59:31.638
Is anyone holding a torch light source, going
through this?

00:59:31.638 --> 00:59:33.721
LAURA: He's got his flaming war hammer.

00:59:33.721 --> 00:59:35.335
MARISHA: Yeah, and I'll light up my hands.

00:59:35.335 --> 00:59:37.871
TALIESIN: I think I still have a torch, actually.

00:59:37.871 --> 00:59:40.382
MATT: Have you been carrying it with you
throughout this?

00:59:40.382 --> 00:59:41.379
TALIESIN: Yeah.

00:59:41.379 --> 00:59:42.226
MATT: Okay.

00:59:42.226 --> 00:59:43.112
LIAM: Dagger.

00:59:43.112 --> 00:59:45.630
MATT: Okay, so you have enough light sources to
keep a general idea of what's going on, and I know

00:59:45.630 --> 00:59:50.298
a lot of you guys have darkvision, too, so you have a
pretty decent range. What's the marching order

00:59:50.400 --> 00:59:53.320
here, guys? Just so I know, continuing down this
path.

00:59:53.320 --> 00:59:58.749
SAM: We'll go Percy, Cassandra, Cassandra, Percy,
Percy, Percy, Percy, Cassandra.

00:59:58.749 --> 01:00:00.508
MARISHA: Boy girl, boy girl, boy girl.

01:00:00.508 --> 01:00:02.563
LAURA: I'm going to perception ahead, so I'll be
towards the front.

01:00:02.599 --> 01:00:03.942
MATT: Towards the front?

01:00:03.942 --> 01:00:06.436
LIAM: How about Grog in second place? You big
sponge.

01:00:06.436 --> 01:00:08.320
MATT: Is Trinket staying with you or staying in
back?

01:00:08.320 --> 01:00:09.549
LAURA: He's going to stay further back.

01:00:09.549 --> 01:00:10.769
MARISHA: Put me in a happy middle.

01:00:10.769 --> 01:00:15.163
MATT: Grog's second. Keyleth is, you said, in the
middle?

01:00:15.163 --> 01:00:16.326
SAM: She's lucky Pierre.

01:00:16.326 --> 01:00:18.086
MATT: All right, the rest of you guys?

01:00:18.086 --> 01:00:21.388
LAURA: Trinket's staying close to Scanlan.

01:00:21.388 --> 01:00:23.678
MATT: Okay. Scanlan, you staying towards the
back?

01:00:23.678 --> 01:00:24.706
SAM: I guess so.

01:00:24.706 --> 01:00:26.673
MATT: All right. Percy and Vax?

01:00:26.673 --> 01:00:31.803
LIAM: I'll be behind Grog, as well.

01:00:31.803 --> 01:00:34.498
TALIESIN: So I'll be in the back with my sister.

01:00:34.498 --> 01:00:38.977
MATT: All right, and this is Cassandra.

01:00:38.977 --> 01:00:41.118
LAURA: Oh no. She's so drunk.

01:00:41.118 --> 01:00:43.768
MATT: Okay, so it's like a flying V formation you
guys are pushing in here.

01:00:43.768 --> 01:00:45.252
TALIESIN: Go home, de Rolo, you're drunk.

01:00:45.252 --> 01:00:55.925
MATT: All right, so. You progress through the
undercroft as quietly as possible. You notice as

01:00:55.925 --> 01:01:01.330
you get past the first section, you look to your
right and left and the inside of these small like

01:01:01.330 --> 01:01:08.908
cubby offshoots that contain these separate ten by
ten stone tombs. The walls have shelves burrowed

01:01:08.908 --> 01:01:17.654
into it, in which there are urns and small gems
and offerings-- things that were buried alongside

01:01:17.654 --> 01:01:21.426
the family members as part of a remembrance.

01:01:21.426 --> 01:01:23.679
LIAM and LAURA: (make snatching noises)

01:01:23.679 --> 01:01:25.451
MATT: Yeah, no. Don't go Skyrim on me.

01:01:25.451 --> 01:01:27.900
TALIESIN: Yeah. Not fun.

01:01:27.900 --> 01:01:34.417
MATT: Once again, you see the doors are open, and
from what you can tell, the stone lids on the

01:01:34.417 --> 01:01:42.280
tombs are pulled off and to the side. Across the
way, as you move towards the center of the room to

01:01:42.280 --> 01:01:48.778
the second set of openings, you can see the far
wall which, the room ends in the far side, but

01:01:48.778 --> 01:01:56.658
there is about a 15, 20-foot wide and about a ten
to 15-foot tall hole burrowed into the far wall.

01:01:56.658 --> 01:02:03.036
And the closer you get, you see large piles of
dirt that fill one side of the room were put off

01:02:03.036 --> 01:02:09.143
to the side as if pieces of this dig were
discarded and there is a trail of dirt across the

01:02:09.143 --> 01:02:13.979
ground that appears to have not been very well
cleaned to show that dirt was being moved in and

01:02:13.979 --> 01:02:21.195
out of this area. You also see, as you push
two-thirds into the room, broken pieces of

01:02:21.195 --> 01:02:26.422
whitestone that had been carved into what looks
like parts of walls or pillars. Support things

01:02:26.422 --> 01:02:34.220
that failed in their construction and just broke
and were tossed and discarded to the side. Make a

01:02:34.220 --> 01:02:38.045
perception check.

01:02:38.045 --> 01:02:39.158
MARISHA: Oh!

01:02:39.158 --> 01:02:42.560
TALIESIN: Oh! Natural 20.

01:02:42.560 --> 01:02:43.683
SAM: Jesus.

01:02:43.683 --> 01:02:45.460
TRAVIS: What the flipping fuck, man.

01:02:45.460 --> 01:02:47.964
TALIESIN: I had a one today.

01:02:47.964 --> 01:02:49.331
MATT: A one.

01:02:49.331 --> 01:02:50.899
TRAVIS: And four 20s.

01:02:50.899 --> 01:02:52.057
TALIESIN: I had a one.

01:02:52.057 --> 01:02:55.842
MATT: One of you Critters out there has to get
Taliesin a really, really pretty new d20 that he

01:02:55.842 --> 01:02:57.448
has to use going forward.

01:02:57.448 --> 01:03:00.417
TALIESIN: That's shapeways.com.

01:03:00.417 --> 01:03:01.662
MATT: Not that one!

01:03:01.662 --> 01:03:03.738
(laughter)

01:03:03.738 --> 01:03:06.632
MATT: All right. So what did you get?

01:03:06.632 --> 01:03:07.628
MARISHA: 29.

01:03:07.628 --> 01:03:08.528
SAM: 12.

01:03:08.528 --> 01:03:09.603
LIAM: 26.

01:03:09.603 --> 01:03:11.113
LAURA: I don't remember. It wasn't very good.

01:03:11.113 --> 01:03:11.918
MATT: Okay.

01:03:11.918 --> 01:03:12.775
TRAVIS: 13.

01:03:12.775 --> 01:03:21.046
MATT: Okay. Those of you with about 25 or above,
you glance and you find two of these slivers of

01:03:21.046 --> 01:03:31.012
this material you don't recognize and part of this
broken stone. It's like a dark green glass. About

01:03:31.012 --> 01:03:37.415
a half an inch to an inch thick in slivers. You
only find a small scattering few, and it has a

01:03:37.415 --> 01:03:48.367
grainy texture to it, and you take a look at it,
and it's transparent. You can see shapes through

01:03:48.367 --> 01:03:53.291
it, but it's opaque enough to the point where it
distorts a little bit of the visual and color

01:03:53.291 --> 01:03:54.583
behind it.

01:03:54.583 --> 01:04:00.755
MARISHA: Can I do a nature check on this? Is this
similar to the broken glass that I collected

01:04:00.755 --> 01:04:01.737
before?

01:04:01.737 --> 01:04:03.943
MATT: Which broken glass you collected before?

01:04:03.943 --> 01:04:07.987
MARISHA: I don't know. I just have broken glass
shards.

01:04:07.987 --> 01:04:10.421
TRAVIS: I feel like that was the red stones or
something from before.

01:04:10.421 --> 01:04:11.632
MARISHA: I feel like there was some sort of--

01:04:11.632 --> 01:04:13.223
TALIESIN: There was that sea of glass.

01:04:13.223 --> 01:04:15.137
MARISHA: Yeah, we were in some cavern.

01:04:15.137 --> 01:04:20.613
MATT: Oh, the sea of bone and glass? Okay. Yeah,
it is not similar to that, no. However, those who

01:04:20.613 --> 01:04:23.554
are trained in arcana, you can go ahead and make
an arcana roll.

01:04:23.554 --> 01:04:26.189
LAURA: Trained in arcana?

01:04:26.189 --> 01:04:27.404
MATT: Trained in arcana.

01:04:27.404 --> 01:04:29.319
LAURA: How do you know if you're trained in
arcana?

01:04:29.319 --> 01:04:30.474
TRAVIS: Negative two.

01:04:30.474 --> 01:04:33.190
MATT: You would have filled in, if you have a
proficiency.

01:04:33.190 --> 01:04:34.011
SAM: The dot?

01:04:34.011 --> 01:04:34.776
TALIESIN: The dot.

01:04:34.776 --> 01:04:35.684
LAURA: Oh.

01:04:35.684 --> 01:04:37.504
SAM: Oh. 11.

01:04:37.504 --> 01:04:43.806
MATT: You have really no idea what this glass is.

01:04:43.806 --> 01:04:45.059
LIAM: I grab it back.

01:04:45.059 --> 01:04:46.216
MATT: Okay.

01:04:46.216 --> 01:04:50.377
SAM: That was just me? I'm the only arcana-trained
person here?

01:04:50.377 --> 01:04:51.356
LAURA: That's it?

01:04:51.356 --> 01:04:54.951
SAM: Wow. Sorry, guys. Sorry.

01:04:54.951 --> 01:04:56.656
MARISHA: Can I try a nature check on it?

01:04:56.656 --> 01:04:58.017
MATT: Sure.

01:04:58.017 --> 01:05:02.049
MARISHA: He's like, "It's not going to tell you
shit, but sure." 15?

01:05:02.049 --> 01:05:12.964
MATT: It's glass. Most glass you understand is
designed by usually sand or other materials that

01:05:12.964 --> 01:05:17.787
at a high temperature or some sort of process is
melted and fused.

01:05:17.787 --> 01:05:22.218
MARISHA: So it's manufactured.

01:05:22.218 --> 01:05:28.811
MATT: It appears to be, or naturally occurred, and
the structure of it has this bumpy, wavy-- it's

01:05:28.811 --> 01:05:30.227
not like smooth glass.

01:05:30.227 --> 01:05:31.495
MARISHA: Like when lightning hits sand?

01:05:31.495 --> 01:05:34.526
MATT: Kind of. But you're not sure what it
actually is.

01:05:34.526 --> 01:05:36.778
LAURA: I wonder if this was holding that acid.

01:05:36.778 --> 01:05:40.660
TALIESIN: I wonder if something very, very hot...

01:05:40.660 --> 01:05:43.585
MARISHA: I'm wondering if it's a symptom of
something.

01:05:43.585 --> 01:05:46.643
SAM: When they burn the whitestone with the acid
or something?

01:05:46.643 --> 01:05:50.090
LAURA: Do I see any recent tracks around here?
Does it look like people came down here?

01:05:50.090 --> 01:05:56.947
MATT: Make a survival check with advantage because
you're a crazy ranger tracker.

01:05:56.947 --> 01:06:04.158
LAURA: 13.

01:06:04.158 --> 01:06:10.468
MATT: You see tracks here and there, some fresher
than others. Yeah.

01:06:10.468 --> 01:06:12.158
LIAM: How many of us found this?

01:06:12.158 --> 01:06:15.200
MATT: Well, two of you saw it.

01:06:15.200 --> 01:06:16.415
LIAM: I've got one.

01:06:16.415 --> 01:06:17.566
MATT: Yeah, you've got one piece.

01:06:17.566 --> 01:06:18.520
LIAM: And Percy's got the other?

01:06:18.520 --> 01:06:20.004
MATT: Second piece, yeah.

01:06:20.004 --> 01:06:21.419
SAM: You want to burn one?

01:06:21.419 --> 01:06:25.155
LIAM: I walk away from the group all the way to
the back, and I take it--

01:06:25.155 --> 01:06:27.548
MATT: To where you came from?

01:06:27.548 --> 01:06:33.918
LIAM: Yeah, towards where we came from. What's
behind us? Is it just tunnel back that way?

01:06:33.918 --> 01:06:37.641
MATT: You mean on that path you're going?

01:06:37.641 --> 01:06:39.687
LIAM: Yeah, I push through the back of the group
to the back.

01:06:39.687 --> 01:06:40.579
MATT: Okay.

01:06:40.579 --> 01:06:41.919
LIAM: What's behind us?

01:06:41.919 --> 01:06:43.988
MATT: Where you just came from is the stairs that
lead up to the castle.

01:06:43.988 --> 01:06:47.950
LIAM: I was going to throw it, but...

01:06:47.950 --> 01:06:52.372
TRAVIS: I see Vex looking around. Can I look for
tracks as well? I'm proficient in survival, and I

01:06:52.372 --> 01:06:53.645
never use it.

01:06:53.645 --> 01:06:57.109
MATT: Sure.

01:06:57.109 --> 01:07:00.408
TRAVIS: Natural 20! I swear to god.

01:07:00.408 --> 01:07:03.927
MATT: While you sit there inspecting the dirt--

01:07:03.927 --> 01:07:07.424
LAURA: It looks like there's some tracks here, but
I don't know what it's saying.

01:07:07.424 --> 01:07:15.789
MATT: Grog, you immediately see a cluster of
recent footprints, probably a day old at most,

01:07:15.789 --> 01:07:28.025
that lead in towards the tunnel. Looks like the
prints are of seven individuals. Feet are fairly

01:07:28.025 --> 01:07:35.098
wide, masculine and heavy in step. One gait
appears to be smaller, thinner, and more

01:07:35.098 --> 01:07:36.389
feminine.

01:07:36.389 --> 01:07:38.673
TRAVIS: How many tombs are open around us?

01:07:38.673 --> 01:07:45.092
MATT: Eight total in this room.

01:07:45.092 --> 01:07:47.505
TRAVIS: Should we check the tombs?

01:07:47.505 --> 01:07:49.043
LAURA: They're already open and empty.

01:07:49.043 --> 01:07:50.532
SAM: They're open and empty.

01:07:50.532 --> 01:07:52.142
MATT: You all make a perception check.

01:07:52.142 --> 01:07:53.558
MARISHA: All of us?

01:07:53.558 --> 01:07:56.595
SAM: Ten.

01:07:56.595 --> 01:07:58.119
MARISHA: 28.

01:07:58.119 --> 01:07:59.418
TALIESIN: 25.

01:07:59.418 --> 01:08:00.618
LIAM: 20.

01:08:00.618 --> 01:08:01.903
LAURA: 11.

01:08:01.903 --> 01:08:03.403
TRAVIS: 18.

01:08:03.403 --> 01:08:05.186
MATT: Okay, 20 and above that'd be just you two?

01:08:05.186 --> 01:08:06.278
LIAM: 20.

01:08:06.278 --> 01:08:12.978
MATT: Oh, yeah, three. All right, so you three,
you notice the temperature drop ever so slightly

01:08:12.978 --> 01:08:20.768
in the room and in the darkened shadow. you look
around and you see what appears to be some sort of

01:08:20.768 --> 01:08:23.061
ethereal mass drifting away.

01:08:23.061 --> 01:08:24.162
TALIESIN: Damn it!

01:08:24.162 --> 01:08:25.481
MARISHA: God damn it! Here we go again.

01:08:25.481 --> 01:08:26.597
LIAM: We've got company.

01:08:26.597 --> 01:08:29.705
MATT: There's one round that you three get to act.
The rest of you have a surprise round right now.

01:08:29.705 --> 01:08:31.996
MARISHA: What kind of mist?

01:08:31.996 --> 01:08:35.220
SAM: Bad deadly ghost mist.

01:08:35.220 --> 01:08:36.782
MARISHA: What kind of mist?

01:08:36.782 --> 01:08:38.145
SAM: A miasma.

01:08:38.145 --> 01:08:45.773
MATT: Grog and Vex are out here checking this. You
guys are back here. Keyleth is here. Vax, you're

01:08:45.773 --> 01:08:51.622
back here. Trinket's up with you, and Scanlan
you're--

01:08:51.622 --> 01:08:52.897
SAM: I was in the back.

01:08:52.897 --> 01:09:07.187
MATT: So you're over here with these guys. You see
one drifts out from this side, another drifts out

01:09:07.187 --> 01:09:10.431
from this side, and another drifts in from this
side.

01:09:10.431 --> 01:09:13.432
MARISHA: Undead ghoulie guys?

01:09:13.432 --> 01:09:14.779
LIAM: Ghosts. Wraiths.

01:09:14.779 --> 01:09:16.140
MARISHA: Wraiths?

01:09:16.140 --> 01:09:23.207
MATT: There is a cold chill that runs down the
spine of Keyleth and Vax, as they've encountered

01:09:23.207 --> 01:09:25.412
enemies similar to this in the past.

01:09:25.412 --> 01:09:27.774
MARISHA: It's that fucking shit that turned us.

01:09:27.774 --> 01:09:33.178
MATT: All right, let's roll some initiatives.

01:09:33.178 --> 01:09:36.656
TRAVIS: Just those three, right?

01:09:36.656 --> 01:09:37.934
MATT: Just those three.

01:09:37.934 --> 01:09:39.509
TALIESIN: I feel like an asshole.

01:09:39.509 --> 01:09:40.683
MARISHA: Shut the fuck up!

01:09:40.683 --> 01:09:42.022
TALIESIN: I feel like an asshole.

01:09:42.022 --> 01:09:42.897
MARISHA: Get out!

01:09:42.897 --> 01:09:45.430
TALIESIN: I'm changing dice. This is bullshit.

01:09:45.430 --> 01:09:47.508
MATT: Yeah, I'm banning that d20 for the rest of
the game.

01:09:47.508 --> 01:09:48.734
TALIESIN: I'm changing dice.

01:09:48.734 --> 01:09:55.176
MARISHA: It makes no sense. Yes! It's a hollow
die.

01:09:55.176 --> 01:10:00.495
TALIESIN: It's a hollow die. There's nothing to be
weighted on it. It's a wiffle die.

01:10:00.495 --> 01:10:02.308
MARISHA: And I rolled a one!

01:10:02.308 --> 01:10:06.696
MATT: So it's just you. Okay, so! Initiatives.

01:10:06.696 --> 01:10:08.785
TALIESIN: 28.

01:10:08.785 --> 01:10:11.217
MATT: (giggles) Okay.

01:10:11.217 --> 01:10:12.274
MARISHA: 14.

01:10:12.274 --> 01:10:13.309
MATT: Okay.

01:10:13.309 --> 01:10:14.125
LIAM: 15.

01:10:14.125 --> 01:10:15.221
TALIESIN: Thank you for that.

01:10:15.221 --> 01:10:18.893
MARISHA: (laughing) I can't believe I did that.
Rolled a one on it.

01:10:18.893 --> 01:10:23.727
MATT: All right. Percy, you're up first. You
glance around, and you can see the two entities

01:10:23.727 --> 01:10:29.490
going (hiss) towards you, towards Keyleth, and you
glance over your shoulder and see one drifting out

01:10:29.490 --> 01:10:31.133
of the distance towards Vax.

01:10:31.133 --> 01:10:37.133
TALIESIN: I yell, "Look out!" And I take several
steps toward Vax.

01:10:37.133 --> 01:10:42.126
MATT: To there?

01:10:42.126 --> 01:10:45.638
TALIESIN: Actually, on the other side of the
pillar so I can actually see the one that's

01:10:45.638 --> 01:10:46.938
getting towards him.

01:10:46.938 --> 01:10:47.956
MATT: There?

01:10:47.956 --> 01:10:48.622
TALIESIN: Yeah.

01:10:48.622 --> 01:10:51.423
MATT: You won't be able to see this one, just
those. This one actually will block your view to

01:10:51.423 --> 01:10:57.295
that one. These are about ten feet tall. These are
the little sections here, so right now, you would

01:10:57.295 --> 01:11:04.723
be able to see these two here and barely see this
one. It would have three-quarters cover. Which you

01:11:04.723 --> 01:11:05.848
ignore, with Sharpshooter.

01:11:05.848 --> 01:11:10.326
TALIESIN: I know. I want to back up into that
corner, though, just to get away from them.

01:11:10.326 --> 01:11:11.380
MATT: Over here?

01:11:11.380 --> 01:11:12.289
TALIESIN: Yeah.

01:11:12.289 --> 01:11:14.712
MATT: Okay, so you can see one of them right now.

01:11:14.712 --> 01:11:23.292
TALIESIN: I'll take-- fuck. Yep, screw it. I'll
take shots with the Pepperbox.

01:11:23.292 --> 01:11:24.567
MATT: Okay.

01:11:24.567 --> 01:11:25.846
TALIESIN: I'll take my first shot.

01:11:25.846 --> 01:11:27.022
MATT: Go for it.

01:11:27.022 --> 01:11:32.017
TALIESIN: That can't be right. Just checking. 20.
Natural 20.

01:11:32.017 --> 01:11:32.926
MATT: Okay.

01:11:32.926 --> 01:11:33.838
LAURA: With a different dice?

01:11:33.838 --> 01:11:36.178
TALIESIN: With a different die. Of course, with a
different die.

01:11:36.178 --> 01:11:37.488
MARISHA: Shut the fuck up!

01:11:37.488 --> 01:11:39.050
TRAVIS: Who are you?

01:11:39.050 --> 01:11:44.480
TALIESIN: I'm the devil. I am the devil, and I
have come to do the devil's work.

01:11:44.480 --> 01:11:47.995
MATT: So all of you who are going to conventions
to meet Taliesin in the future, make sure you get

01:11:47.995 --> 01:11:51.082
a nice long hold of his hand so you can roll
better, too.

01:11:51.082 --> 01:11:52.232
TRAVIS: Yeah, would you touch my dice?

01:11:52.232 --> 01:11:55.798
TALIESIN: I will lick your die, because that is
how I bless them.

01:11:55.798 --> 01:12:01.077
MATT: All right, so that's your first attack.
Second attack?

01:12:01.077 --> 01:12:02.316
TALIESIN: First attack.

01:12:02.316 --> 01:12:03.698
MATT: Both at the same guy?

01:12:03.698 --> 01:12:07.882
TALIESIN: Yeah, all against the same guy.

01:12:07.882 --> 01:12:09.190
MATT: Okay. Go for it.

01:12:09.190 --> 01:12:14.774
TALIESIN: First attack is 22 points of damage.

01:12:14.774 --> 01:12:16.710
MATT: Okay, is this with the element, or not?

01:12:16.710 --> 01:12:17.788
TALIESIN: No, no element.

01:12:17.788 --> 01:12:20.557
MATT: Okay. You fire. Just passes through it with
no effect.

01:12:20.557 --> 01:12:24.396
MARISHA: Yeah, fucking misty dudes.

01:12:24.396 --> 01:12:25.624
TRAVIS: What?

01:12:25.624 --> 01:12:28.788
MARISHA: Damn misty dudes. I'm mocking them.

01:12:28.788 --> 01:12:30.199
TALIESIN: I spin.

01:12:30.199 --> 01:12:31.154
MATT: Okay.

01:12:31.154 --> 01:12:34.320
TALIESIN: Shoot with fire.

01:12:34.320 --> 01:12:36.866
MATT: Okay.

01:12:36.866 --> 01:12:38.598
TALIESIN: What the fuck?!

01:12:38.598 --> 01:12:41.109
MARISHA: Get out!

01:12:41.109 --> 01:12:42.834
MATT: Take a picture. Take a picture right now.

01:12:42.834 --> 01:12:43.938
TALIESIN: Taking a picture.

01:12:43.938 --> 01:12:45.084
MARISHA: Get out! You're the anti-Wheaton.

01:12:45.084 --> 01:12:46.265
SAM: He's had, like, eight tonight.

01:12:46.265 --> 01:12:47.208
MARISHA: How many is that?

01:12:47.208 --> 01:12:48.579
TALIESIN: I don't know!

01:12:48.579 --> 01:12:53.093
MARISHA: CritRoleStats, how many is that? Tell us!
I know you've been counting.

01:12:53.093 --> 01:12:54.911
LAURA: Ridiculous.

01:12:54.911 --> 01:12:57.686
SAM: Go to Vegas!

01:12:57.686 --> 01:12:59.087
TALIESIN: I'll put it on Instagram later.

01:12:59.087 --> 01:13:00.518
MARISHA: Go to Vegas!

01:13:00.518 --> 01:13:01.518
LAURA: Yeah.

01:13:01.518 --> 01:13:03.297
TALIESIN: I go to Vegas. I don't gamble!

01:13:03.297 --> 01:13:04.397
LAURA: We need to go.

01:13:04.397 --> 01:13:07.127
MATT: You need to go find the D&amp;amp;D casino.

01:13:07.127 --> 01:13:09.682
SAM: D&amp;amp;D casino?

01:13:09.682 --> 01:13:11.995
MATT: D&amp;amp;D casino. Make it happen, guys. I know one
of you can.

01:13:11.995 --> 01:13:13.077
TALIESIN: All right.

01:13:13.077 --> 01:13:15.143
MATT: So which one is this?

01:13:15.143 --> 01:13:17.894
TALIESIN: This is fire elemental.

01:13:17.894 --> 01:13:18.790
MATT: Okay.

01:13:18.790 --> 01:13:27.721
TALIESIN: That's 14 points of damage, plus three
damage of fire.

01:13:27.721 --> 01:13:29.259
MATT: That's including crit damage?

01:13:29.259 --> 01:13:32.032
TALIESIN: Including the crit damage. I rolled
really poorly on my damage.

01:13:32.032 --> 01:13:36.997
MATT: Okay, so this one, the bullet does (impact
noise) hit its form with a burst of flame, the

01:13:36.997 --> 01:13:42.455
bullet converted to magical due to the nature of
the chamber. You can see its form (raspy cry). It

01:13:42.455 --> 01:13:45.727
disperses for a second and then re-forms,
continuing its movement.

01:13:45.727 --> 01:13:47.486
TALIESIN: We need magic! I'm taking my last
shot.

01:13:47.486 --> 01:13:48.511
MATT: Okay.

01:13:48.511 --> 01:13:52.131
MARISHA: That was seven, by the way. Seven 20s
this game.

01:13:52.131 --> 01:13:53.635
MATT: That's stupid.

01:13:53.635 --> 01:13:57.078
TALIESIN: Okay, see? That's better. 15.

01:13:57.078 --> 01:13:58.892
MATT: 15 does hit.

01:13:58.892 --> 01:14:08.686
TALIESIN: All right. They're easy to hit, at
least. That's such a shitty roll. 12 points of ice

01:14:08.686 --> 01:14:09.690
damage.

01:14:09.690 --> 01:14:16.731
MATT: Okay. The ice shot (gunshot) tears through
it, doing additional damage. You see part of its

01:14:16.731 --> 01:14:20.102
form crystallize from the little bit of ectoplasm
that's floating in the air, but it's not enough to

01:14:20.102 --> 01:14:28.142
actually disperse its form. It continues pushing
forward. You would have to reload to use those

01:14:28.142 --> 01:14:29.112
again.

01:14:29.112 --> 01:14:30.345
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm out.

01:14:30.345 --> 01:14:36.856
MATT: Okay, that ends your turn. It's now their
go. This one drifts forward to Keyleth. This one

01:14:36.856 --> 01:14:38.890
drifts forward to Grog.

01:14:38.890 --> 01:14:41.199
MARISHA: That's with our surprise round? You said
we have a surprise round.

01:14:41.199 --> 01:14:44.977
MATT: No, you guys were aware. Everyone else is
surprised.

01:14:44.977 --> 01:14:49.899
MARISHA: Oh, we're the only three that aren't
surprised. Oh, that sucks.

01:14:49.899 --> 01:14:54.710
MATT: So. Unless you do anything against
surprise?

01:14:54.710 --> 01:14:56.205
TRAVIS: Not unless I'm raging.

01:14:56.205 --> 01:15:06.471
MATT: That's true. All right. Keyleth, I need you
to make a constitution saving throw. Sorry, no, a

01:15:06.471 --> 01:15:07.848
charisma saving throw.

01:15:07.848 --> 01:15:13.941
MARISHA: A charisma saving throw? That's not
great. And no saving throw bonuses, okay, so

01:15:13.941 --> 01:15:15.381
that's ten?

01:15:15.381 --> 01:15:17.672
LIAM: (quietly) Oh, she's gone.

01:15:17.719 --> 01:15:19.880
MARISHA: We've been here before.

01:15:19.880 --> 01:15:21.419
MATT: Did you roll already?

01:15:21.419 --> 01:15:22.620
MARISHA: I did.

01:15:22.620 --> 01:15:23.741
MATT: What did you get?

01:15:23.741 --> 01:15:24.747
MARISHA: Ten.

01:15:24.747 --> 01:15:35.326
MATT: Ten. Okay. The ghost reaches out and
embraces Keyleth. It disappears into her form and

01:15:35.362 --> 01:15:38.827
she shivers for a second, and it is no longer
visible.

01:15:38.827 --> 01:15:40.887
LAURA: Oh, he's taken over her body?

01:15:40.887 --> 01:15:45.252
MATT: Keyleth's eyes all of a sudden flare up with
a ghostly blue glow, and she turns around, looking

01:15:45.252 --> 01:15:53.941
at the group with a hunger you haven't seen in her
eyes. For those who see it, as well-- I should

01:15:53.941 --> 01:15:57.734
have made this happen before-- I need you guys to
immediately after seeing these ghosts make a

01:15:57.734 --> 01:15:58.999
wisdom saving throw.

01:15:58.999 --> 01:15:59.934
TALIESIN: What for?

01:15:59.934 --> 01:16:00.777
SAM: Everyone?

01:16:00.777 --> 01:16:01.870
MATT: No, just the ones that see it.

01:16:01.870 --> 01:16:04.595
LAURA: We're all immune to fear because of the
feast.

01:16:04.595 --> 01:16:06.861
MATT: That's right, so never mind. That doesn't
matter.

01:16:06.861 --> 01:16:08.507
SAM: (laughs) Yeah!

01:16:08.507 --> 01:16:13.967
MATT: Good reminding. So I was right, then. I
didn't forget anything! All right,

01:16:13.967 --> 01:16:15.674
charisma saving throw?

01:16:15.674 --> 01:16:17.805
LIAM: Charisma saving throw?

01:16:17.805 --> 01:16:18.798
MATT: Correct.

01:16:18.798 --> 01:16:19.746
LIAM: Okay.

01:16:19.746 --> 01:16:20.988
MARISHA: This isn't a charm thing?

01:16:20.988 --> 01:16:22.670
MATT: And Grog, charisma saving throw.

01:16:22.670 --> 01:16:23.640
LAURA: Is this charm?

01:16:23.640 --> 01:16:28.382
MATT: Nope. This is not a charm.

01:16:28.382 --> 01:16:32.318
LIAM: Okay, so a 12 for me. Am I caught, as well?

01:16:32.318 --> 01:16:33.319
SAM: 12?

01:16:33.319 --> 01:16:34.228
MATT: 12?

01:16:34.228 --> 01:16:35.067
LIAM: Yeah.

01:16:35.067 --> 01:16:35.964
MATT: Okay.

01:16:35.964 --> 01:16:39.213
TALIESIN: God damn it.

01:16:39.213 --> 01:16:41.026
SAM: That was your last Luck, too.

01:16:41.026 --> 01:16:42.795
LIAM: No, that's two, isn't it?

01:16:42.795 --> 01:16:44.115
MARISHA: You did two.

01:16:44.115 --> 01:16:45.905
LAURA: We're going to die!

01:16:45.905 --> 01:16:47.906
TRAVIS: Grog is batting for the other team.

01:16:47.906 --> 01:16:49.378
MATT: What did you roll?

01:16:49.378 --> 01:16:50.460
TRAVIS: Four.

01:16:50.460 --> 01:16:54.272
LAURA: (muffled) We don't even have a cleric with
us!

01:16:54.272 --> 01:16:57.049
SAM: Wait, this is against charisma?

01:16:57.049 --> 01:16:58.347
LAURA and MARISHA: Yeah.

01:16:58.347 --> 01:16:59.449
SAM: Jesus.

01:16:59.449 --> 01:17:06.422
MATT: And with that, three of your teammates turn
around, their eyes intensely glowing with some

01:17:06.422 --> 01:17:09.385
sort of a weird ghostly glow.

01:17:09.385 --> 01:17:13.124
MARISHA: Three v three, man. Battle royale. Let's
do this.

01:17:13.167 --> 01:17:14.426
TALIESIN: Oh god.

01:17:14.426 --> 01:17:16.508
SAM: Wait, we have to fight them?

01:17:16.508 --> 01:17:18.870
MARISHA: He's going to call it at eight. He's
going to call it.

01:17:18.870 --> 01:17:20.614
MATT: Everyone else roll initiative.

01:17:20.614 --> 01:17:23.537
SAM: We have to fight them. How is that going to
happen?

01:17:23.579 --> 01:17:25.531
TALIESIN: This is going to go so poorly.

01:17:25.531 --> 01:17:27.726
TRAVIS: Not us. Not the possessed ones, right?

01:17:27.726 --> 01:17:31.080
MATT: No, you guys are already on the initiative.
Oh, no. Grog, you still do.

01:17:31.080 --> 01:17:32.454
TRAVIS: I still roll initiative?

01:17:32.454 --> 01:17:33.654
MATT: Yeah, for yourself.

01:17:33.654 --> 01:17:35.121
LAURA: What?

01:17:35.121 --> 01:17:37.305
TRAVIS: I'm possessed, though.

01:17:37.305 --> 01:17:45.155
TALIESIN: Roll your initiative.

01:17:45.155 --> 01:17:46.521
LIAM: What just happened?

01:17:46.521 --> 01:17:49.479
LAURA: You have to roll initiative to see when you
attack all of us.

01:17:49.479 --> 01:17:50.528
MATT: Yeah.

01:17:50.528 --> 01:17:52.263
TRAVIS: Well, then it's good it was a one.

01:17:52.263 --> 01:17:54.226
MATT: (laughs) Okay.

01:17:54.226 --> 01:17:56.566
MARISHA: Do we roll initiative, too? We're
re-rolling initiative, the three of us?

01:17:56.566 --> 01:18:00.358
MATT: Everyone who hasn't rolled yet rolls now.

01:18:00.358 --> 01:18:01.449
MARISHA: Oh.

01:18:01.449 --> 01:18:02.540
SAM: 15.

01:18:02.540 --> 01:18:03.706
MATT: 15. Okay.

01:18:03.706 --> 01:18:05.069
TRAVIS: Unless I have to roll with advantage.

01:18:05.069 --> 01:18:07.535
SAM: Do you have to roll with advantage?

01:18:07.535 --> 01:18:10.724
MATT: Technically, you would, yeah.

01:18:10.724 --> 01:18:12.028
TRAVIS: Two.

01:18:12.028 --> 01:18:14.454
MATT: All right, and what did you get?

01:18:14.454 --> 01:18:15.291
LAURA: 13.

01:18:15.291 --> 01:18:19.675
MATT: 13. All right. Percy, you're up first.

01:18:19.675 --> 01:18:24.195
MARISHA: Help us!

01:18:24.195 --> 01:18:26.251
TALIESIN: I don't know what to do.

01:18:26.251 --> 01:18:28.029
LAURA: We don't have a cleric!

01:18:28.029 --> 01:18:30.936
SAM: You have-- ugh.

01:18:30.936 --> 01:18:32.481
MARISHA: I think you guys--

01:18:32.481 --> 01:18:35.254
SAM: No, it's up to us to figure out, right?

01:18:35.254 --> 01:18:37.450
LAURA: He cast Turn Undead. We don't have that.

01:18:37.450 --> 01:18:38.917
MARISHA: Was that when Kashaw was here?

01:18:38.917 --> 01:18:39.733
LAURA: Yeah.

01:18:39.733 --> 01:18:41.852
MARISHA: That was Kashaw. Yeah, he cast Turn
Undead.

01:18:41.852 --> 01:18:43.725
TRAVIS: Awesome. He's not here right now. What are
you going to do?

01:18:43.725 --> 01:18:44.952
TALIESIN: Okay! What are we going to do?

01:18:44.952 --> 01:18:46.508
MATT: What are you going to do?

01:18:46.508 --> 01:18:53.298
TALIESIN: (sighs) All right, who's the most
dangerous?

01:18:53.298 --> 01:18:54.970
TRAVIS: Does Cassandra have any--

01:18:54.970 --> 01:18:59.665
TALIESIN: That's my first action. I'm going to use
my bonus action to turn to my sister and go, what

01:18:59.665 --> 01:19:01.740
the hell do we do?

01:19:01.740 --> 01:19:08.049
MATT: She looks at you, a little bit frustrated.

01:19:08.049 --> 01:19:14.886
MARISHA: Please tell me she trained in cleric.
Please tell me she multiclassed.

01:19:14.886 --> 01:19:28.657
MATT: She looks about, annoyed, and goes, "I'm
sorry. I'm not a holy woman. I have no symbols. I

01:19:28.657 --> 01:19:31.461
"have no power. I have nothing. Let's see what we
can do."

01:19:31.461 --> 01:19:35.095
TALIESIN: All right. I'm--

01:19:35.095 --> 01:19:38.572
MARISHA: You guys have that holy water, right?

01:19:38.572 --> 01:19:43.885
TALIESIN: I'm backing up. I'm going to do my best
to back up into the tomb right here.

01:19:43.885 --> 01:19:45.310
MATT: Right there?

01:19:45.310 --> 01:19:51.220
TALIESIN: Keep going to my right until the
drop-off behind me, and I'm going to back up into

01:19:51.220 --> 01:19:52.301
the tomb.

01:19:52.301 --> 01:19:54.104
MATT: Okay. Into there?

01:19:54.104 --> 01:19:57.152
TALIESIN: No, up. Towards you; the other side.

01:19:57.152 --> 01:19:58.148
MATT: There we go.

01:19:58.148 --> 01:19:59.868
TALIESIN: There we go. I'm putting my back against
the wall.

01:19:59.868 --> 01:20:01.505
MATT: Okay, so you're up against the stone?

01:20:01.505 --> 01:20:02.546
TALIESIN: I mean that column.

01:20:02.546 --> 01:20:04.705
MARISHA: Take the damn laser pointer.

01:20:04.705 --> 01:20:06.145
TALIESIN: Yeah, there.

01:20:06.145 --> 01:20:07.182
MATT: There you go.

01:20:07.182 --> 01:20:08.197
TALIESIN: Yeah!

01:20:08.197 --> 01:20:09.411
MATT: All right.

01:20:09.411 --> 01:20:15.300
TALIESIN: I'm unloading two shots. I'm reloading
and unloading two magical shots at Vax.

01:20:15.300 --> 01:20:16.827
MATT: Okay.

01:20:16.870 --> 01:20:31.573
TALIESIN: I'm going to burn some fucking points.
What am I going to do?

01:20:31.573 --> 01:20:35.200
SAM: We're fucked!

01:20:35.200 --> 01:20:37.052
TRAVIS: Do your worst.

01:20:37.052 --> 01:20:44.555
TALIESIN: First shot-- fuck it, I'm using the old
die. I've already rolled two 20s on that one.

01:20:44.555 --> 01:20:51.843
First shot, I'm shooting to get Vax to drop his
knives.

01:20:51.843 --> 01:20:53.309
MATT: Okay.

01:20:53.309 --> 01:20:55.225
TALIESIN: Burning a grit point to drop his knife.

01:20:55.225 --> 01:20:56.430
MARISHA: Good idea!

01:20:56.430 --> 01:20:57.861
MATT: He has two, so you only knock--

01:20:57.861 --> 01:21:01.732
TALIESIN: One of them out of his hand. The one
that doesn't auto-return.

01:21:01.732 --> 01:21:03.669
LIAM: They all do.

01:21:03.669 --> 01:21:04.697
TALIESIN: They all do?

01:21:04.697 --> 01:21:05.538
LIAM: Yeah.

01:21:05.538 --> 01:21:08.225
MATT: That crazy belt, man.

01:21:08.225 --> 01:21:15.247
TALIESIN: Shooting him in the face. Fuck it. And
my gun jams. You did that!

01:21:15.247 --> 01:21:16.810
MARISHA: I touched it. I'm sorry!

01:21:16.810 --> 01:21:22.678
MATT: (laughs) You turn around and holding your
gun out at Vax, even with this ghostly form, it's

01:21:22.678 --> 01:21:27.307
so hard to do so, and you close your eyes for a
second and you pull the trigger, and in a weird

01:21:27.307 --> 01:21:34.546
way you're both immediately distraught and at the
same time relieved that the gun jammed.

01:21:34.546 --> 01:21:35.605
(mechanical noise)

01:21:35.605 --> 01:21:36.948
TALIESIN: (frustrated noise)

01:21:36.948 --> 01:21:38.088
MATT: So that's your turn.

01:21:38.088 --> 01:21:38.987
TALIESIN: Yep.

01:21:38.987 --> 01:21:53.085
MATT: All right. Vax, you're up first. The ghost
drives you to turn up to him as he's trying to fix

01:21:53.085 --> 01:22:00.037
the gun. Daggers out. Go ahead and make your two
attacks against him. No sneak attack damage.

01:22:00.037 --> 01:22:06.160
LIAM: The first was a 13. The second was a 22.

01:22:06.160 --> 01:22:07.700
MATT: Pretty sure the 22 hits.

01:22:07.700 --> 01:22:08.607
TALIESIN: 22 hits.

01:22:08.607 --> 01:22:11.081
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and roll damage against
Percy.

01:22:11.081 --> 01:22:13.955
LIAM: Eight.

01:22:13.955 --> 01:22:19.923
MATT: All right, so you take eight points of
piercing damage. You feel the blade (pained cry)

01:22:19.923 --> 01:22:23.518
pierce into the side. It doesn't get too far in,
but you haven't been on the receiving end of his

01:22:23.518 --> 01:22:28.713
daggers before, and it's not fun seeing what they
do to others. All right, at the end of your turn,

01:22:28.713 --> 01:22:36.440
I want you to make a religion check.

01:22:36.487 --> 01:22:38.584
SAM: Check?

01:22:38.584 --> 01:22:39.936
TALIESIN: Oh yeah!

01:22:39.936 --> 01:22:41.148
MARISHA: Come on.

01:22:41.148 --> 01:22:43.181
TALIESIN: Magic fingers.

01:22:43.181 --> 01:22:44.410
LAURA: Magic glove.

01:22:44.410 --> 01:22:46.063
MARISHA: Do you want Taliesin to lick it?

01:22:46.063 --> 01:22:48.317
LIAM: 18.

01:22:48.317 --> 01:22:56.254
MATT: 18? That gentle glow left behind, that
slight sliver of Pike's essence that went into

01:22:56.254 --> 01:23:04.812
your symbol of Sarenrae, flares for a second. It
flares again, and for a moment, in your head, in

01:23:04.812 --> 01:23:08.257
which darkness has taken your vision, you feel
your body moving on its own, but you have no

01:23:08.257 --> 01:23:15.873
control. You hear Pike's voice whisper in your ear
from a distance. It says, "Vax? It's okay." At

01:23:15.873 --> 01:23:21.277
which point, suddenly you feel the coldness sucked
out from you. The symbol flares for a second, and

01:23:21.277 --> 01:23:23.519
the ghost is thrust out of your form.

01:23:23.519 --> 01:23:24.775
MARISHA: (excited shout)

01:23:24.775 --> 01:23:26.274
TALIESIN: Yeah!

01:23:26.274 --> 01:23:34.046
MATT: That is your turn, however. All right.
Scanlan, you're up.

01:23:34.046 --> 01:23:52.045
SAM: I read my Scroll of Spirit Guardians. I call
them forth to protect us in this moment.

01:23:52.045 --> 01:23:54.555
TALIESIN: Treguna mekoides--

01:23:54.595 --> 01:23:55.857
SAM: Hakuna matata.

01:23:55.857 --> 01:23:57.697
TALIESIN: Trecorum satis dee.

01:23:57.697 --> 01:23:59.853
SAM: I don't know how this works.

01:23:59.853 --> 01:24:01.832
(laughter)

01:24:01.832 --> 01:24:03.341
MATT: That's okay.

01:24:03.341 --> 01:24:10.887
SAM: (silly voice) They attack bad things around
me, and they don't like bad things, so I thought

01:24:10.887 --> 01:24:12.336
maybe that would be good.

01:24:12.336 --> 01:24:14.463
(laughter)

01:24:14.463 --> 01:24:25.029
SAM: Spirit Guardians. The thing I bought from
Gilmore. Right? Didn't I buy the Scroll of Spirit

01:24:25.029 --> 01:24:26.369
Guardians?

01:24:26.369 --> 01:24:27.972
LAURA: Yeah, you did.

01:24:27.972 --> 01:24:32.614
SAM: They attack anything evil within 15 feet of
me.

01:24:32.614 --> 01:24:34.468
MATT: Indeed.

01:24:34.468 --> 01:24:39.277
SAM: Necrotic damage.

01:24:39.277 --> 01:24:45.453
MATT: There we go: Spirit Guardians. So you call
forth spirits to protect you for the duration, for

01:24:45.453 --> 01:24:50.956
up to ten minutes. Your alignment is...?

01:24:50.956 --> 01:24:52.163
SAM: Good?

01:24:52.163 --> 01:24:53.122
MATT: Good, yeah.

01:24:53.122 --> 01:25:02.212
SAM: Good-ish. Sort of devious good.

01:25:02.212 --> 01:25:09.145
MATT: Okay, so here's what you do. You actually
use this to create these guardians-- this spell

01:25:09.145 --> 01:25:13.289
hasn't been used, either. To a distance of 15
feet. You have to choose things within 15 feet of

01:25:13.289 --> 01:25:14.829
you, so you have these two right here.

01:25:14.829 --> 01:25:17.193
SAM: They're both within 15 feet of me, aren't
they?

01:25:17.193 --> 01:25:22.579
MATT: So, these guys. Their speed is halved.

01:25:22.579 --> 01:25:30.047
SAM: When they take their turn, they get 3d8
damage.

01:25:30.047 --> 01:25:31.704
MATT: Yeah.

01:25:31.704 --> 01:25:37.580
SAM: It's a very confusing spell.

01:25:37.580 --> 01:25:43.612
MATT: Yeah, when they move within 15 feet of you,
their speed is halved, and at the start or when

01:25:43.612 --> 01:25:46.445
they enter the area, they make a wisdom saving
throw or take radiant damage.

01:25:46.445 --> 01:25:47.846
SAM: Is that now or when they move?

01:25:47.846 --> 01:25:49.573
MATT: That will be at the end of their turn.

01:25:49.573 --> 01:25:51.691
TALIESIN: Yay, radiant damage. That's awesome.

01:25:51.691 --> 01:25:52.879
SAM: I know.

01:25:52.879 --> 01:25:54.957
TALIESIN: You made a good call.

01:25:54.957 --> 01:25:55.987
TRAVIS: Nice, dude.

01:25:55.987 --> 01:26:01.750
MATT: All right. Does that end your turn?

01:26:01.750 --> 01:26:03.388
SAM: Do I get a bonus action?

01:26:03.388 --> 01:26:05.467
MATT: You get a bonus action, yes.

01:26:05.467 --> 01:26:14.100
SAM: Okay. Who's not undead right now? You? I've
already inspired you once. Sure, I'll inspire you

01:26:14.100 --> 01:26:23.226
again. I've got nothing. This time, I'll just go,
(harmonica noises).

01:26:23.226 --> 01:26:25.691
LAURA: I feel really inspired.

01:26:25.691 --> 01:26:30.891
MATT: Take the lamest d10 you've ever accepted,
because harmonica's not your favorite instrument.

01:26:30.891 --> 01:26:41.218
All righty. Great. That brings us to Keyleth's
turn.

01:26:41.218 --> 01:26:48.358
TALIESIN: (squeaking noise)

01:26:48.358 --> 01:26:51.859
MARISHA: Did you just squeak?

01:26:51.859 --> 01:26:55.940
TALIESIN: Maybe. You don't know. Shut up!

01:26:55.940 --> 01:27:02.487
MATT: So it turns towards Scanlan, having cast
that, and you make a staff attack against him.

01:27:02.487 --> 01:27:04.383
MARISHA: (grunts)

01:27:04.383 --> 01:27:16.559
SAM: I do a little doo-wop. (vocalizes) And that's
my Cutting Words to try to distract her from her

01:27:16.559 --> 01:27:17.418
attack.

01:27:17.418 --> 01:27:18.938
MATT: Okay. Go for it.

01:27:18.938 --> 01:27:20.015
MARISHA: I rolled a 19.

01:27:20.015 --> 01:27:21.061
SAM: Do I roll now?

01:27:21.061 --> 01:27:23.486
MATT: Yeah, you roll a d10 and subtract that from
her attack.

01:27:23.486 --> 01:27:24.553
MARISHA: I rolled a 19.

01:27:24.553 --> 01:27:26.582
SAM: Two.

01:27:26.582 --> 01:27:28.024
MATT: So it's a 17.

01:27:28.024 --> 01:27:29.157
MARISHA: What's your AC?

01:27:29.157 --> 01:27:31.020
SAM: I have a 17 armor class.

01:27:31.020 --> 01:27:32.560
MATT: Roll damage.

01:27:32.560 --> 01:27:36.691
SAM: Oh, wait! No, that's a ten. That's right.

01:27:36.691 --> 01:27:42.675
MARISHA: It's not a lot of damage, I promise. Oh,
see? Even better. Four damage.

01:27:42.675 --> 01:27:45.158
SAM: Oh. I shouldn't have even wasted it.

01:27:45.158 --> 01:27:46.138
TALIESIN: It's "ow."

01:27:46.138 --> 01:27:48.218
LAURA: It's just your little staff?

01:27:48.218 --> 01:27:50.309
SAM: You're adorable.

01:27:50.309 --> 01:27:51.785
MARISHA: I'm still doing my granny routine.

01:27:51.785 --> 01:28:02.289
MATT: Okay, now it has to make a wisdom saving
throw, which it succeeds. It still takes half as

01:28:02.289 --> 01:28:04.756
much damage, so roll 3d8.

01:28:04.756 --> 01:28:05.809
SAM: Who, me?

01:28:05.809 --> 01:28:06.681
MATT: Yes.

01:28:06.681 --> 01:28:15.041
SAM: Oh. Yes. Of course I will. I will do that
right now with these d8s that I have. 12.

01:28:15.041 --> 01:28:28.227
MATT: Okay. All righty. So this burst of radiant
energy burns around her. You take 12 points of

01:28:28.227 --> 01:28:29.245
radiant damage.

01:28:29.245 --> 01:28:33.106
MARISHA: 12 points?

01:28:33.106 --> 01:28:37.337
MATT: Yep. Vex, you're up.

01:28:37.337 --> 01:28:39.731
LAURA: All right.

01:28:39.731 --> 01:28:43.782
MATT: You see Grog turn to you with this wicked
grin on his face, eyes glowing a pale whitish-blue

01:28:43.782 --> 01:28:46.005
as he brings the hammer up in the air.

01:28:46.005 --> 01:28:51.484
LAURA: Oh god! Am I close by him?

01:28:51.484 --> 01:28:53.878
MATT: You are. You're right next to him.

01:28:53.878 --> 01:28:55.248
LAURA: I'm right next to him?

01:28:55.248 --> 01:28:56.440
MATT: You're right there.

01:28:56.440 --> 01:29:03.507
LAURA: Oh no! I back away from him. He's going to
get an attack on me.

01:29:03.507 --> 01:29:04.551
MATT: Yep.

01:29:04.551 --> 01:29:06.613
LAURA: But I really needed to put some distance
there.

01:29:06.613 --> 01:29:08.311
MATT: Make an attack of opportunity.

01:29:08.311 --> 01:29:10.659
LAURA: Wait! Okay, that's good.

01:29:10.659 --> 01:29:13.271
TRAVIS: 13.

01:29:13.271 --> 01:29:14.654
LAURA: You don't hit me!

01:29:14.654 --> 01:29:19.711
MATT: Whiff. (impact noise) The hammer hits the
side of the stonework, cracking it a little.

01:29:19.711 --> 01:29:20.985
TALIESIN: Oh, that's my mausoleum.

01:29:20.985 --> 01:29:23.174
MATT: What are you doing, Vex?

01:29:23.174 --> 01:29:30.621
LAURA: I'm going to have Trinket-- is he lined up
with anybody?

01:29:30.621 --> 01:29:34.523
MATT: Just Keyleth right now.

01:29:34.523 --> 01:29:37.706
LAURA: He can't cannonball through to Grog and
Keyleth?

01:29:37.706 --> 01:29:40.105
MATT: He can, but he'll hit Scanlan, as well.

01:29:40.105 --> 01:29:42.205
LAURA: Can you dodge, Scanlan?

01:29:42.205 --> 01:29:47.092
SAM: We'll see. Let's do this. I always loved that
bear.

01:29:47.092 --> 01:29:50.219
LAURA: Right! You deserve it. He's doing it.

01:29:50.219 --> 01:29:58.407
MATT: We'll say Trinket backs up a little bit to
get enough room on it. Keyleth, swing an attack.

01:29:58.407 --> 01:30:01.083
MARISHA: Oh, to Trinket?

01:30:01.083 --> 01:30:04.148
MATT: Yeah. Trinket has to get enough distance to
actually build up momentum.

01:30:04.148 --> 01:30:05.845
MARISHA: Oh, I think that hits. 20 total?

01:30:05.845 --> 01:30:08.804
MATT: 20 total is exactly the AC. Roll damage for
Trinket.

01:30:08.804 --> 01:30:11.321
MARISHA: It's okay. It's not a lot. Nine?

01:30:11.321 --> 01:30:13.628
MATT: Trinket takes nine points of bludgeoning
damage from the staff.

01:30:13.628 --> 01:30:14.669
LAURA: Halved?

01:30:14.669 --> 01:30:22.287
MATT: Right, yeah, because it's bludgeoning, so
five points. Trinket then rolls forward, (thudding

01:30:22.332 --> 01:30:27.928
noises). Roll attacks on Grog, Scanlan, and
Keyleth.

01:30:27.928 --> 01:30:30.639
MARISHA: Trinket bowling.

01:30:30.639 --> 01:30:40.984
LAURA: Eight plus 16 is 24.

01:30:40.984 --> 01:30:45.656
MATT: For who? Keyleth, Scanlan, and Grog.

01:30:45.656 --> 01:30:47.646
LAURA: Okay, so Keyleth is 24.

01:30:47.646 --> 01:30:48.718
MARISHA: Hits.

01:30:48.718 --> 01:30:50.724
LAURA: Scanlan is 18.

01:30:50.724 --> 01:30:51.528
SAM: Hits.

01:30:51.528 --> 01:30:52.945
LAURA: And Grog is 18.

01:30:52.945 --> 01:30:54.084
TRAVIS: Misses.

01:30:54.084 --> 01:30:55.585
LAURA: No, Grog is 20.

01:30:55.585 --> 01:30:56.704
TRAVIS: Hits.

01:30:56.704 --> 01:31:02.086
MATT: All three hit? All right, so no attacks of
opportunity against Trinket. Roll damage, and

01:31:02.086 --> 01:31:03.479
everyone takes that damage.

01:31:03.479 --> 01:31:06.982
LAURA: I don't know what to roll for cannonball
damage because I've never actually gotten to hit.

01:31:06.982 --> 01:31:09.235
MATT: Oh, I know. I have this. It's 2d6 plus
four.

01:31:09.235 --> 01:31:13.088
LAURA: Okay. For each person?

01:31:13.088 --> 01:31:13.978
MATT: Yep.

01:31:13.978 --> 01:31:18.517
LAURA: Oh, okay, so ten for Keyleth.

01:31:18.517 --> 01:31:20.417
MATT: Ten points of bludgeoning damage.

01:31:20.417 --> 01:31:24.906
LAURA: Seven plus four is 11 for Scanlan.

01:31:24.906 --> 01:31:25.890
SAM: Okay.

01:31:25.890 --> 01:31:29.772
LAURA: Oh, less for Grog. Eight.

01:31:29.772 --> 01:31:31.242
MATT: Eight points of damage for Grog.

01:31:31.242 --> 01:31:36.739
LAURA: And while he's doing-- I don't get to shoot
an arrow. Yes, I do! I get to shoot an arrow.

01:31:36.739 --> 01:31:37.611
MATT: Bonus.

01:31:37.611 --> 01:31:41.322
LAURA: I'm going to shoot an arrow as Trinket is
hitting Grog.

01:31:41.322 --> 01:31:42.254
MATT: Okay.

01:31:42.254 --> 01:31:50.546
LAURA: Oh god. 14 doesn't hit him.

01:31:50.546 --> 01:31:56.490
MATT: Nope. It hits the shoulder and gleans off
and carves a little wound across his chest, but not

01:31:56.490 --> 01:32:01.488
enough to do any damage. That ends your turn.
Grog.

01:32:01.535 --> 01:32:04.750
LAURA: And now Trinket is close to me, then. Did
he go through them and get back to me?

01:32:04.750 --> 01:32:07.526
MATT: Trinket, due to the line, slams into Grog at
the end of it, so he is now between the three

01:32:07.526 --> 01:32:08.461
others.

01:32:08.461 --> 01:32:09.594
LAURA: Shit.

01:32:09.594 --> 01:32:20.051
MATT: Grog. As a ghost, you just got shot and
slammed by a bear. I want you to roll one d20.

01:32:20.051 --> 01:32:22.438
MARISHA: Oh, he's going to see if he raged.

01:32:22.438 --> 01:32:25.705
TRAVIS: 15.

01:32:25.705 --> 01:32:30.830
MATT: 15. Your attention goes to Vex, as opposed
to Trinket. You move out of the way.

01:32:30.830 --> 01:32:33.399
SAM: And he takes 3d8.

01:32:33.399 --> 01:32:35.455
MATT: That's true.

01:32:35.455 --> 01:32:41.332
SAM: Eight plus nine is 17.

01:32:41.332 --> 01:32:49.375
MATT: Well, the creature has to make a wisdom
save. Fails, so yeah, takes 3d8. Yep.

01:32:49.375 --> 01:32:50.945
SAM: 17.

01:32:50.945 --> 01:32:52.164
MATT: 17.

01:32:52.164 --> 01:32:53.199
TRAVIS: 17 to hit?

01:32:53.199 --> 01:32:54.982
SAM: No, I just hit you with 17 points of damage.

01:32:54.982 --> 01:32:55.917
TRAVIS: Okay.

01:32:55.917 --> 01:33:04.306
MATT: All right. You're feeling the ghostly form--
you take the damage as soon as the form inside;

01:33:04.306 --> 01:33:11.164
you're feeling this dissipation. All right, so you
make your two attacks against Vex.

01:33:11.164 --> 01:33:12.177
LAURA: Shit.

01:33:12.177 --> 01:33:15.505
TRAVIS: Oh, that's not awesome. That's 17.

01:33:15.505 --> 01:33:16.716
LAURA: Doesn't hit.

01:33:16.716 --> 01:33:19.571
TRAVIS: That does. 24.

01:33:19.571 --> 01:33:25.075
MATT: Yeah. Go ahead and roll damage. The first
hammer swing you're ready for. Swing backward. It

01:33:25.075 --> 01:33:25.966
goes long.

01:33:25.966 --> 01:33:27.857
LAURA: Grog! Grog, no. No!

01:33:27.857 --> 01:33:32.816
TRAVIS: 20 on the first.

01:33:32.816 --> 01:33:36.167
MATT: 20 points of damage. (impact noise) First
one didn't hit, did it?

01:33:36.167 --> 01:33:38.017
LAURA: The first one didn't hit, so you only get
the 20.

01:33:38.017 --> 01:33:39.136
TRAVIS: Oh, just the 20!

01:33:39.136 --> 01:33:43.046
MATT: Just 20, so as the first one misses, you
pull back, trying to stop him, but the hammer

01:33:43.046 --> 01:33:46.021
still slams you in the side; you don't have time
to move out of the way, and it pushes you up

01:33:46.021 --> 01:33:50.647
against the wall. You land on your feet, and you
can feel the pulsing of the blood broken beneath

01:33:50.647 --> 01:33:54.551
the skin. That ends Grog's go. Percy, you're up.

01:33:54.551 --> 01:34:02.146
TALIESIN: (gasps, sighs) "Hi!" I saw what just
happened, right?

01:34:02.164 --> 01:34:03.465
MATT: Yeah.

01:34:03.465 --> 01:34:04.894
TALIESIN: I'm going to try to fix my gun.

01:34:04.929 --> 01:34:06.407
MATT: Go for it.

01:34:06.407 --> 01:34:07.508
TALIESIN: That fixes.

01:34:07.508 --> 01:34:08.450
MATT: All righty.

01:34:08.450 --> 01:34:20.343
TALIESIN: (sighs) Are you better? Good, then
let's deal with this. I'm going to start diving

01:34:20.343 --> 01:34:22.692
around the columns to get away from the wraith.

01:34:22.692 --> 01:34:23.713
MATT: Around here?

01:34:23.713 --> 01:34:25.131
TALIESIN: Yeah, because I don't have a shot this
round.

01:34:25.131 --> 01:34:27.666
MATT: Okay, so you move around that way.

01:34:27.666 --> 01:34:28.523
TALIESIN: Yeah, cool.

01:34:28.523 --> 01:34:31.124
MATT: All right. That ends your turn?

01:34:31.124 --> 01:34:31.955
TALIESIN: That ends my turn.

01:34:31.955 --> 01:34:46.432
MATT: It's now their turn. This one currently
loses interest in you and drifts two, three, four,

01:34:46.473 --> 01:34:53.618
five, six, seven, eight-- it (whoosh) passes
through the stone. Moves through and appears on

01:34:53.618 --> 01:34:56.580
the other side. I need you to make a charisma
saving throw.

01:34:56.580 --> 01:35:00.851
TALIESIN: I have advantage on charisma saving
throws right now, do I not?

01:35:00.851 --> 01:35:03.002
LAURA: Oh, yeah, because she cast--

01:35:03.002 --> 01:35:05.293
MARISHA: It's not there anymore. Sorry.

01:35:05.293 --> 01:35:08.317
MATT: Yeah. She dropped it when she picked up the
concentration spell.

01:35:08.317 --> 01:35:11.582
TRAVIS: Roll high, golden snitch.

01:35:11.582 --> 01:35:13.403
MATT: And that was ability checks, not saving
throws.

01:35:13.403 --> 01:35:22.765
TALIESIN: Oh, then never mind. What's my charisma
saving-- oh boy. Nope. I rolled a natural one. You

01:35:22.765 --> 01:35:25.472
did this! This is the third natural one. You
touched it.

01:35:25.472 --> 01:35:28.754
LAURA: That's why I'm superstitious about my
dice.

01:35:28.754 --> 01:35:29.925
MARISHA: I touched it.

01:35:29.925 --> 01:35:31.704
LAURA: He also touched mine, and I rolled a
three.

01:35:31.704 --> 01:35:34.739
TALIESIN: I'll come back to you after
Thanksgiving, baby.

01:35:34.739 --> 01:35:43.173
MATT: And with that, it goes dark and a spiritual
intent takes over your body. You feel like you're

01:35:43.173 --> 01:35:46.943
being puppeted, and you have no control over
yourself. You're hidden, captured within your own

01:35:46.943 --> 01:35:51.787
form. All right, that ends his turn. Vax, you're
up.

01:35:51.787 --> 01:35:52.758
LIAM: Okay.

01:35:52.758 --> 01:36:01.490
MATT: You still feel the residual warmth in your
glove pulsing.

01:36:01.490 --> 01:36:12.284
LIAM: All right. I'm going to click my boots
together. I'm going to move towards him.

01:36:12.284 --> 01:36:14.585
MATT: Towards Percy?

01:36:14.585 --> 01:36:21.444
LIAM: Towards Percy. Shit. I'm going to take the
keen dagger and stick it into his gut, and I'm

01:36:21.444 --> 01:36:25.745
going to take the glove with the symbol of
Sarenrae and punch him in the nose.

01:36:25.745 --> 01:36:26.949
MATT: Okay.

01:36:26.949 --> 01:36:31.365
LAURA: I like that you're violent instead of just
going, "Healing hand."

01:36:31.365 --> 01:36:32.364
MARISHA: Yeah!

01:36:32.364 --> 01:36:33.821
LAURA: You go, "fuck you!"

01:36:33.821 --> 01:36:37.566
SAM: Can I just say, this is Percy beating up
Percy right now.

01:36:37.566 --> 01:36:40.354
(laughter)

01:36:40.354 --> 01:36:43.476
MATT: Yeah. You're being attacked and stabbed by
yourself. It's weird.

01:36:43.476 --> 01:36:44.547
LIAM: 20 for the dagger.

01:36:44.547 --> 01:36:46.749
TALIESIN: I'm not reading too much into this.

01:36:46.749 --> 01:36:47.846
MATT: That hits.

01:36:47.846 --> 01:36:52.405
LIAM: The punch is just strength modifier, right?

01:36:52.405 --> 01:36:53.653
TALIESIN: This is not a metaphor!

01:36:53.653 --> 01:36:55.115
LIAM: 17 for the punch.

01:36:55.115 --> 01:37:02.491
MATT: All right. Roll damage for the dagger.
What's your AC?

01:37:02.491 --> 01:37:03.413
TALIESIN: 18.

01:37:03.413 --> 01:37:04.625
MATT: 18. Okay.

01:37:04.625 --> 01:37:06.283
LIAM: Nine.

01:37:06.283 --> 01:37:10.914
MATT: You take nine points of piercing damage as
the dagger stabs into your stomach. As you swing

01:37:10.914 --> 01:37:14.891
to haul the punch off, the body ducks out of the
way.

01:37:14.891 --> 01:37:16.426
MARISHA: Take the punch!

01:37:16.426 --> 01:37:18.101
MATT: All right. That ends your turn.

01:37:18.101 --> 01:37:19.613
LIAM: Wait. How far did I go?

01:37:19.613 --> 01:37:25.787
MATT: You were there, so that's 15 feet.

01:37:25.787 --> 01:37:28.655
LIAM: I want to spring back and run as far as I
can in the other direction, around the corner

01:37:28.655 --> 01:37:30.185
towards the rest.

01:37:30.185 --> 01:37:37.095
MATT: All right. That brings us to Scanlan.

01:37:37.095 --> 01:37:48.593
SAM: I walk between Grog and Keyleth, maintaining
my 15-foot distance. Even more between.

01:37:48.593 --> 01:37:50.252
MATT: There?

01:37:50.252 --> 01:37:54.495
SAM: Yeah, and I'll Thunderwave them both. Oh no,
and I hit Trinket.

01:37:54.495 --> 01:37:58.136
(laughter)

01:37:58.136 --> 01:38:05.516
MATT: All right. Constitution saving throw from
Grog and Keyleth and Trinket.

01:38:05.516 --> 01:38:09.636
TRAVIS: Do we roll something?

01:38:09.636 --> 01:38:10.754
LAURA: Yeah.

01:38:10.754 --> 01:38:11.723
MATT: What did you roll?

01:38:11.723 --> 01:38:12.722
MARISHA: 12.

01:38:12.722 --> 01:38:15.255
MATT: (thud) Grog?

01:38:15.255 --> 01:38:16.455
TRAVIS: I rolled an 18.

01:38:16.455 --> 01:38:18.593
MATT: What's your DC?

01:38:18.593 --> 01:38:20.089
SAM: 19.

01:38:20.089 --> 01:38:22.619
MATT: All right, so roll damage. What's
Trinket's?

01:38:22.619 --> 01:38:25.230
LAURA: You have a constitution saving throw of
eight.

01:38:25.230 --> 01:38:26.706
TRAVIS: Oh. 26.

01:38:26.706 --> 01:38:27.824
MATT: Okay, so you take half damage.

01:38:27.824 --> 01:38:30.563
LAURA: Trinket rolled an 11.

01:38:30.563 --> 01:38:32.793
MATT: Okay. (thud)

01:38:32.793 --> 01:38:37.000
SAM: Eight points of damage.

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:40.621
MATT: Okay, so you take eight points of damage.
Grog takes four. Trinket takes eight.

01:38:40.621 --> 01:38:47.951
SAM: Are we trying to kill our friends, here?

01:38:47.951 --> 01:38:49.116
TRAVIS: Yeah, get us.

01:38:49.116 --> 01:38:51.825
LAURA: Get them unconscious so they come out. But
then if they're unconscious, the ghosts come out

01:38:51.825 --> 01:38:53.847
and they could possess us.

01:38:53.847 --> 01:38:55.342
SAM: That's great.

01:38:55.342 --> 01:38:57.413
MARISHA: But they take radiant damage.

01:38:57.413 --> 01:39:00.677
MATT: Keyleth, top of the turn, roll--

01:39:00.677 --> 01:39:03.358
MARISHA: Did I get radiant damage from that push?

01:39:03.358 --> 01:39:04.246
SAM: No.

01:39:04.246 --> 01:39:06.294
MATT: You take 3d8 points of radiant damage.

01:39:06.294 --> 01:39:07.315
MARISHA: Oh, I do.

01:39:07.315 --> 01:39:15.318
SAM: From the spirit guardians. Oh, and I'll also
inspire Vax. (sings) Rip out someone's tongue

01:39:15.318 --> 01:39:21.741
and I'll know you. Cure someone dead and I'll show
you've got those moves with dagger. You've got

01:39:21.741 --> 01:39:23.812
those moves with dagger. You've got those--

01:39:23.857 --> 01:39:26.989
ALL: (sings) Moves like dagger.

01:39:26.989 --> 01:39:31.725
SAM: Okay. 13.

01:39:31.725 --> 01:39:41.679
MATT: All right, so 13 points of radiant damage to
you and to... okay.

01:39:41.679 --> 01:39:45.741
MARISHA: 62 hit points.

01:39:45.741 --> 01:39:49.606
MATT: All right. Scanlan, that's your turn.
Keyleth.

01:39:49.606 --> 01:39:50.748
MARISHA: Yeah?

01:39:50.748 --> 01:39:57.148
MATT: You turn around as you see Vax rush up with
a look of fear and intensity on his face. You see

01:39:57.148 --> 01:40:02.290
her turn around with this twisted grin on her
face, and she brings her staff up and swings it

01:40:02.290 --> 01:40:04.075
towards your head. Roll an attack.

01:40:04.075 --> 01:40:09.238
MARISHA: (whoosh) Baseball. 17.

01:40:09.238 --> 01:40:10.608
MATT: What's your AC?

01:40:10.608 --> 01:40:12.515
LIAM: It is 18.

01:40:12.515 --> 01:40:16.641
MATT: 18. As she swings, you duck, and her staff
(impact noise) smacks against the stone wall of

01:40:16.641 --> 01:40:23.629
the mausoleum. That ends your turn, bringing us to
Vex.

01:40:23.629 --> 01:40:27.371
LAURA: And I'm in a fight with Grog.

01:40:27.371 --> 01:40:28.350
MATT: Correct.

01:40:28.350 --> 01:40:34.376
LAURA: Okay. This is totally awesome.

01:40:34.376 --> 01:40:37.882
SAM: Wait! We have Cass. Does she get a turn?

01:40:37.882 --> 01:40:39.715
LAURA: She's not doing anything.

01:40:39.715 --> 01:40:42.272
MATT: I forgot to add her to the initiative.
That's my own fault.

01:40:42.272 --> 01:40:43.871
LAURA: I just thought she was being a bitch.

01:40:43.871 --> 01:40:47.337
MATT: I'll give her a couple of rounds here in a
second. Anyway, finish up.

01:40:47.337 --> 01:40:53.180
LAURA: Trinket runs forward and tries to pull
Grog's focus so that I can back away.

01:40:53.180 --> 01:40:59.752
MATT: Okay, so Trinket moves up to there.

01:40:59.752 --> 01:41:03.509
LAURA: He tries to grapple him, or something. Can
he do anything to make Grog not be able to attack

01:41:03.509 --> 01:41:09.949
me if I run away? Can he try to knock him down, or
something? Jump up on his back and knock him

01:41:09.949 --> 01:41:11.176
over.

01:41:11.176 --> 01:41:16.149
MATT: Use an action to make a trip attack. Sure,
why not. Roll an athletics check.

01:41:16.149 --> 01:41:19.495
LAURA: Okay. Yeah, no problem.

01:41:19.495 --> 01:41:21.636
TALIESIN: I'm imagining a bear doing mild
calisthenics.

01:41:21.636 --> 01:41:25.077
LAURA: An athletics check for me?

01:41:25.077 --> 01:41:26.244
MATT: No, for Trinket.

01:41:26.244 --> 01:41:28.961
LAURA: Okay. 12?

01:41:28.961 --> 01:41:31.108
MATT: Make a strength saving throw, Grog.

01:41:31.108 --> 01:41:36.020
TRAVIS: That's a 26.

01:41:36.020 --> 01:41:41.594
MATT: Yeah, Trinket rushes over and tries to knock
you off your feet, and you just (thud) no effect.

01:41:41.594 --> 01:41:44.411
You still have a bonus action and your movement,
if you want to.

01:41:44.411 --> 01:41:50.329
LAURA: I'm going to try to roll out of the way.
I'm going to try to duck down and roll out of the

01:41:50.329 --> 01:41:53.350
way to make him less likely to hit me.

01:41:53.350 --> 01:41:57.887
SAM: Yeah! The old "less likely" trick.

01:41:57.887 --> 01:42:00.146
MATT: Make an acrobatics check.

01:42:00.146 --> 01:42:03.809
LAURA: Okay. Oh, my dice suck tonight!

01:42:03.809 --> 01:42:05.041
SAM: You're inspired.

01:42:05.041 --> 01:42:07.606
MARISHA: He's sucking up all the good energy.

01:42:07.606 --> 01:42:13.251
LAURA: That's good! Acrobatics. 28.

01:42:13.251 --> 01:42:19.594
MATT: 28? Grog, roll an attack with disadvantage,
just for the hell of it.

01:42:19.594 --> 01:42:24.938
TRAVIS: 23.

01:42:24.938 --> 01:42:28.007
MATT: Okay, roll damage against Vex as she pulls
away from you.

01:42:28.007 --> 01:42:31.951
TRAVIS: The first one was a natural 20.

01:42:31.951 --> 01:42:34.417
MATT: Be glad it was disadvantage.

01:42:34.417 --> 01:42:37.950
TRAVIS: 21.

01:42:37.950 --> 01:42:43.568
MATT: You take 21 points of bludgeoning damage. As
you pull away, Grog (whack) backhands you with his

01:42:43.568 --> 01:42:47.013
hammer. Now you can take your bonus action, if you
want to.

01:42:47.013 --> 01:42:53.179
LAURA: As my bonus action, I'm going to cast--

01:42:53.179 --> 01:42:57.281
TRAVIS: Kill Goliath.

01:42:57.281 --> 01:43:02.163
LAURA: Right? I don't want to use any of my shit!

01:43:02.163 --> 01:43:04.026
TRAVIS: Can you conjure a keg of beer?

01:43:04.026 --> 01:43:06.408
SAM: That would distract you.

01:43:06.408 --> 01:43:13.879
LAURA: I can't, but that's a really good idea. For
my bonus action, I'm going to go, help!

01:43:13.879 --> 01:43:17.493
SAM: You can use your bonus action to throw me the
gun!

01:43:17.493 --> 01:43:20.467
LAURA: Oh. No.

01:43:20.467 --> 01:43:28.208
MATT: All right, that ends your turn. Cassandra is
going to rush up angrily with her shortsword out.

01:43:28.208 --> 01:43:40.973
Rushing up behind Grog, she's going to make a
strike. That is going to be 18.

01:43:40.973 --> 01:43:42.270
What's your armor class?

01:43:42.270 --> 01:43:43.061
TRAVIS: 19.

01:43:43.061 --> 01:43:46.981
MATT: 19. She goes to strike and whiffs,
unfortunately. She's going to attack with her

01:43:46.981 --> 01:43:54.679
dagger she pulls out in her off hand. Rolls a
three. Yeah. I'm giving her a second round because

01:43:54.679 --> 01:43:58.577
I missed the one. She's going to angrily pull up
again and attempt to strike with both a second

01:43:58.577 --> 01:44:01.102
time. That will be a 20.

01:44:01.102 --> 01:44:02.103
TRAVIS: That hits.

01:44:02.103 --> 01:44:06.631
MATT: All righty. Because Trinket is adjacent, she
gets sneak attack damage.

01:44:06.631 --> 01:44:09.082
LAURA: Yay! Oh, she's a rogue.

01:44:09.082 --> 01:44:10.283
LIAM: Rogue.

01:44:10.283 --> 01:44:24.873
MATT: So you take 27 points of piercing damage.
Well, it's slashing damage from the shortsword.

01:44:24.873 --> 01:44:29.240
The offhand attack is another three. Going to
miss.

01:44:29.240 --> 01:44:30.404
TRAVIS: Okay.

01:44:30.404 --> 01:44:40.906
MATT: All righty. That brings us to Grog. Roll
another d20.

01:44:40.906 --> 01:44:46.442
TRAVIS: 11.

01:44:46.442 --> 01:44:52.352
MATT: 11. Your attention switches to Cassandra.
Roll two attacks.

01:44:52.352 --> 01:44:55.752
SAM: Do I get my radiant damage on him?

01:44:55.752 --> 01:45:00.023
MATT: At the top of his turn, you do, yeah.
Actually, before that happens, roll radiant

01:45:00.023 --> 01:45:00.989
damage.

01:45:00.989 --> 01:45:02.327
SAM: 21.

01:45:02.327 --> 01:45:04.710
TRAVIS: 21 points?

01:45:04.710 --> 01:45:11.570
MATT: With that, as you're reeling up your hammer
to strike Cassandra, a burst of radiant energy

01:45:11.608 --> 01:45:16.865
disintegrates the ghostly presence within your
body, and you find your mind come to you as you're

01:45:16.865 --> 01:45:22.405
about to go into a downswing to smash Cassandra's
head in. You catch yourself.

01:45:22.405 --> 01:45:23.711
SAM: Do it anyway, Grog!

01:45:23.711 --> 01:45:25.408
(laughter)

01:45:25.408 --> 01:45:26.585
MARISHA: Don't!

01:45:26.585 --> 01:45:28.151
SAM: She's one of us.

01:45:28.151 --> 01:45:29.705
MATT: You have your turn now.

01:45:29.705 --> 01:45:30.997
TRAVIS: Oh, I have my turn?

01:45:30.997 --> 01:45:31.819
MATT: Yes.

01:45:31.819 --> 01:45:36.950
SAM: Grog, I know you don't know what's going on
right now, but kill Keyleth!

01:45:36.950 --> 01:45:41.805
TRAVIS: Okay. I turn and walk over to Keyleth.

01:45:41.805 --> 01:45:43.528
MATT: Over Cassandra.

01:45:43.528 --> 01:45:44.775
TALIESIN: Poor Cass.

01:45:44.775 --> 01:45:48.911
TRAVIS: I'm going to swing my hammer at the middle
of her chest.

01:45:48.911 --> 01:45:53.995
SAM: Oh, you're scary. She's so cute.

01:45:53.995 --> 01:45:56.025
TRAVIS: 15.

01:45:56.025 --> 01:45:57.957
MATT: What's your AC, Keyleth?

01:45:57.957 --> 01:45:58.982
MARISHA: 18.

01:45:58.982 --> 01:46:02.167
MATT: She ducks out of the way with this
preternatural speed.

01:46:02.167 --> 01:46:05.584
TRAVIS: Wow. 16.

01:46:05.584 --> 01:46:08.434
MARISHA: (cackles)

01:46:08.434 --> 01:46:13.730
MATT: Keyleth's ghostly form is too fast for you.
The confusion of the whole sequence caused you to

01:46:13.730 --> 01:46:18.597
not be able to think straight in the moment, and
you miss twice. That ends your turn, Grog. Percy.

01:46:18.597 --> 01:46:21.956
LAURA: Oh, right. Percy's still--

01:46:21.956 --> 01:46:23.817
SAM: Jesus. And he's got guns.

01:46:23.817 --> 01:46:25.170
MATT: Your gun was just fixed, correct?

01:46:25.170 --> 01:46:26.462
TALIESIN: Yeah.

01:46:26.462 --> 01:46:28.452
(laughter)

01:46:28.452 --> 01:46:32.282
TALIESIN: Would he use the gun or the sword in
phantom mode?

01:46:32.282 --> 01:46:38.242
MATT: You just finished fixing this, and you have
a gun before you. It's going to use it. Make three

01:46:38.242 --> 01:46:40.995
attacks against Vex-- Vax. I mean Vax.

01:46:40.995 --> 01:46:43.503
TALIESIN: I'm going to use this die, because it's
been--

01:46:43.503 --> 01:46:46.383
MARISHA: Failing? Yeah, I touched it. Use the one
that I touched.

01:46:46.383 --> 01:46:54.731
TALIESIN: That's-- I can't talk. 21.

01:46:54.731 --> 01:46:59.544
LIAM: That hits, but what's applicable? Uncanny
Dodge or Evasion for a gunshot?

01:46:59.581 --> 01:47:06.612
MATT: Whatever reduces the damage to half. It's
not a saving throw, so it would be-- which one

01:47:06.612 --> 01:47:08.026
reduces the damage by half?

01:47:08.061 --> 01:47:09.338
LIAM: That's Uncanny Dodge.

01:47:09.338 --> 01:47:12.856
MATT: Then it would be Uncanny Dodge. All right,
so attack two more times.

01:47:12.856 --> 01:47:15.309
TALIESIN: 21.

01:47:15.309 --> 01:47:17.194
MATT: Hits. And?

01:47:17.194 --> 01:47:20.684
TALIESIN: 26.

01:47:20.684 --> 01:47:23.348
MATT: All right, so roll damage three times. The
first one is halved.

01:47:23.348 --> 01:47:29.993
TALIESIN: All right. 13.

01:47:29.993 --> 01:47:32.125
MATT: So you take seven damage.

01:47:32.125 --> 01:47:35.321
TALIESIN: Fuck me. 15.

01:47:35.321 --> 01:47:37.109
MATT: 15 piercing damage.

01:47:37.109 --> 01:47:38.471
TALIESIN: And 11.

01:47:38.471 --> 01:47:42.918
MATT: Okay. (three gunshots)

01:47:42.918 --> 01:47:46.497
SAM: We are so strong! We should never fight
ourselves.

01:47:46.497 --> 01:47:58.402
MATT: All right. That ends Percy's turn there.
Vax, you're up.

01:47:58.402 --> 01:48:04.191
LIAM: Am I able to slide around Keyleth closer to
you, into that little alcove, or am I too pressed

01:48:04.191 --> 01:48:06.790
against the wall? The other way.

01:48:06.790 --> 01:48:10.655
MATT: Currently, it's just enemies, so you can't
move past them.

01:48:10.655 --> 01:48:11.879
LIAM: Okay.

01:48:11.879 --> 01:48:13.939
MATT: I could make you roll an acrobatics check,
if you wanted.

01:48:13.939 --> 01:48:16.791
LIAM: That's all right. I flip the daggers over,
and I start to whale on

01:48:16.791 --> 01:48:18.076
the back of Keyleth's head.

01:48:18.076 --> 01:48:18.843
MATT: Okay.

01:48:18.843 --> 01:48:20.095
LIAM: Pommels of the daggers.

01:48:20.095 --> 01:48:21.921
SAM: Kiss or kill.

01:48:21.921 --> 01:48:25.883
LIAM: 18.

01:48:25.883 --> 01:48:29.650
MATT: Are you doing sneak attack on this? She's
adjacent to Grog, so yeah.

01:48:29.650 --> 01:48:30.794
LIAM: Definitely.

01:48:30.794 --> 01:48:31.873
MATT: 18 hits.

01:48:31.873 --> 01:48:36.760
LIAM: Second one is 20.

01:48:36.760 --> 01:48:39.156
MARISHA: Hits.

01:48:39.156 --> 01:48:41.276
MATT: They both hit, so roll damage on both.

01:48:41.276 --> 01:48:42.752
LIAM: And then 32 on the last.

01:48:42.752 --> 01:48:45.547
MATT: Oh, that's right. So three hits, with sneak
attack.

01:48:45.547 --> 01:48:47.877
MARISHA: Oh, sneak attack is going to take me
down.

01:48:47.877 --> 01:48:57.514
LIAM: Three. Plus seven is ten. And the ten gets
doubled? Or everything?

01:48:57.514 --> 01:48:59.147
MARISHA: Dice rolls get doubled.

01:48:59.147 --> 01:49:03.985
LIAM: Ten, 16, 20, 21, 22, 23, 25, 50.

01:49:03.985 --> 01:49:05.324
SAM: 50?

01:49:05.324 --> 01:49:06.698
LIAM: 50 for the first hit.

01:49:06.698 --> 01:49:08.584
MARISHA: (laughs) I'm still alive.

01:49:08.584 --> 01:49:10.054
MATT: Was it doubled because you rolled a
critical?

01:49:10.054 --> 01:49:11.365
MARISHA: Sneak Attack.

01:49:11.365 --> 01:49:12.950
MATT: Sneak Attack, you just roll the dice.

01:49:12.950 --> 01:49:14.019
LIAM: Well, then no. 25.

01:49:14.019 --> 01:49:14.828
MATT: 25.

01:49:14.828 --> 01:49:16.005
LIAM: Thank you.

01:49:16.005 --> 01:49:16.890
MATT: No worries.

01:49:16.890 --> 01:49:19.016
LIAM: Plus nine, plus nine.

01:49:19.016 --> 01:49:21.184
MATT: Okay, so 25 plus 18...

01:49:21.184 --> 01:49:22.348
LIAM: 38.

01:49:22.348 --> 01:49:23.592
MARISHA: 38? Okay.

01:49:23.592 --> 01:49:27.656
MATT: 25 plus 18 is 43.

01:49:27.656 --> 01:49:30.357
MARISHA: 43?

01:49:30.357 --> 01:49:31.539
MATT: Yep.

01:49:31.539 --> 01:49:32.713
MARISHA: What was I at just now?

01:49:32.713 --> 01:49:34.441
SAM: 62. So you're at 19.

01:49:34.441 --> 01:49:35.597
MARISHA: 19 hit points.

01:49:35.597 --> 01:49:41.847
LIAM: I'm going to use-- I don't care. I'm going
to slide around Grog, to the side. Towards

01:49:41.847 --> 01:49:44.423
Scanlan. Right there, yeah.

01:49:44.423 --> 01:49:45.559
MATT: Okay.

01:49:45.559 --> 01:49:47.608
SAM: What's up, brother?

01:49:47.608 --> 01:49:53.473
MATT: All right, that ends your turn. Scanlan,
you're up.

01:49:53.473 --> 01:49:54.947
SAM: I'm up again?

01:49:54.947 --> 01:49:56.100
MATT: Yep.

01:49:56.100 --> 01:50:02.978
SAM: I feel like I just went. All right. We're
trying to kill our friends, right?

01:50:02.978 --> 01:50:03.945
LIAM: Yes.

01:50:03.945 --> 01:50:09.086
SAM: Okay. Thank you for moving, Vax. I'm going to
blast them both with lightning. Straight shot

01:50:09.086 --> 01:50:10.456
through, 100 feet.

01:50:10.456 --> 01:50:15.161
MATT: Through those two? Yeah. Okay.

01:50:15.161 --> 01:50:19.204
SAM: Yeah. What do I do? 8d6?

01:50:19.204 --> 01:50:23.177
MATT: 8d6, and I need Keyleth and Percy to both
make dexterity saving throws.

01:50:23.177 --> 01:50:29.206
MARISHA: Just the two of us? I actually have
disadvantage on dexterity stuff because of

01:50:29.206 --> 01:50:35.503
corruption. 20 for me.

01:50:35.503 --> 01:50:36.700
TALIESIN: 21.

01:50:36.700 --> 01:50:38.152
MATT: You both take half damage.

01:50:38.152 --> 01:50:39.206
SAM: 24.

01:50:39.206 --> 01:50:45.469
MATT: You both take 12 points of lightning damage.
The bolt strikes through, hitting both of you in

01:50:45.469 --> 01:50:48.240
the chest, but you both manage to pull out of the
way just in time to reduce the

01:50:48.240 --> 01:50:49.473
impact of the spell.

01:50:49.473 --> 01:50:58.830
SAM: And as a bonus action, I'll do a Healing Word
on Vex. Right? You're injured badly?

01:50:58.830 --> 01:51:02.219
LAURA: I mean, not badly, but--

01:51:02.219 --> 01:51:07.686
SAM: Oh, well then fuck it. Oh, you're injured
badly? Would I know that?

01:51:07.726 --> 01:51:11.686
MATT: You could glance over and look at him as he
pulls up to you, and see him (pants).

01:51:11.736 --> 01:51:13.259
LIAM: I've got gunshots in my back.

01:51:13.259 --> 01:51:17.324
SAM: Okay. Yeah, so I'll Healing Word.

01:51:17.324 --> 01:51:19.114
MATT: Roll the healing points for that.

01:51:19.114 --> 01:51:27.109
SAM: What is it? Shit. It's right here: d4 plus
five. That's it?! So lame. Seven points.

01:51:27.109 --> 01:51:31.226
MATT: All right. That ends your turn. Keyleth, at
the top of your turn, roll 3d8 radiant damage.

01:51:31.226 --> 01:51:34.343
SAM: Ooh, yes. Oh, this is going to knock you
out.

01:51:34.343 --> 01:51:35.556
MARISHA: Hopefully.

01:51:35.556 --> 01:51:41.036
SAM: That's nine already.

01:51:41.036 --> 01:51:42.075
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm down.

01:51:42.075 --> 01:51:44.936
SAM: Six more is 15.

01:51:44.936 --> 01:51:52.243
MATT: Keyleth falls unconscious to the ground as
this blast of radiant energy bursts around her as

01:51:52.243 --> 01:51:56.799
this spiritual radiant form that's been
surrounding the area and stalking the various

01:51:56.799 --> 01:52:03.421
individuals. It slams into her form. As she
collapses, the ghost is jettisoned from her body

01:52:03.421 --> 01:52:08.262
and looks like it's been taking the radiant damage
and is having a hard time keeping its corporeal

01:52:08.262 --> 01:52:15.145
form. All right, that ends Keyleth's turn.
Keyleth, I need you to roll a death saving throw.

01:52:15.145 --> 01:52:17.786
MARISHA: Nope. Six.

01:52:17.786 --> 01:52:22.786
MATT: You take one death saving throw failure. All
right. Vex, you're up.

01:52:22.786 --> 01:52:31.576
LAURA: I see the ghost come out of her? Okay, I'm
going to shoot it with my Blazing Bowstring.

01:52:31.576 --> 01:52:33.071
MATT: Okay.

01:52:33.071 --> 01:52:40.050
LAURA: 16?

01:52:40.050 --> 01:52:41.558
MATT: 16 hits.

01:52:41.558 --> 01:52:57.647
LAURA: 17. I want a good one. 17. 25.

01:52:57.647 --> 01:53:02.122
MATT: 25. As you pull back the arrow and you see
the flames ignite around the shaft, you release

01:53:02.122 --> 01:53:08.586
it. It slams into the ghost, and you see its form
(raspy cry) disperse from the impact, the arrow

01:53:08.586 --> 01:53:12.676
hitting the wall behind it and shattering against
the stone. Ghost destroyed.

01:53:12.676 --> 01:53:17.816
LAURA: For my second attack, I'm going to attack
Percy. Can I see him?

01:53:17.816 --> 01:53:19.181
MATT: Yep, right over there.

01:53:19.181 --> 01:53:22.930
LAURA: All right, I'm going to do it. 21.

01:53:22.930 --> 01:53:24.187
MATT: 21 hits.

01:53:24.187 --> 01:53:27.981
TALIESIN: (ghost noises)

01:53:27.981 --> 01:53:28.974
LAURA: 16.

01:53:28.974 --> 01:53:30.803
MATT: 16 points of damage to you, Percy.

01:53:30.803 --> 01:53:32.071
TALIESIN: 16?

01:53:32.071 --> 01:53:32.981
MATT: Yep.

01:53:32.981 --> 01:53:33.712
TALIESIN: Cool.

01:53:33.712 --> 01:53:35.413
LAURA: That was also through my Blazing
Bowstring.

01:53:35.413 --> 01:53:37.881
MATT: So you're using both Blazing Bowstring
abilities right now?

01:53:37.881 --> 01:53:38.715
LAURA: Yeah.

01:53:38.715 --> 01:53:42.860
MATT: Okay. A flaming arrow (impact noise) sticks
into the shoulder, and you can feel the flames

01:53:42.860 --> 01:53:44.122
burning into your body--

01:53:44.122 --> 01:53:46.468
LAURA: Plus another five. That was another five
burning damage.

01:53:46.468 --> 01:53:47.251
TRAVIS: 21.

01:53:47.251 --> 01:53:48.174
TALIESIN: 21?

01:53:48.174 --> 01:53:49.592
MATT: There you go.

01:53:49.592 --> 01:53:51.578
TALIESIN: I'm still doing fine.

01:53:51.578 --> 01:53:52.984
MARISHA: I hate these things.

01:53:52.984 --> 01:53:57.523
MATT: It's now Cass's turn. Cass, who's having a
weird time with the whole process of seeing a

01:53:57.523 --> 01:54:00.631
bunch of herselves and her brothers stabbing each
other and getting possessed.

01:54:00.631 --> 01:54:01.922
LAURA: How do we even know who's who?

01:54:01.922 --> 01:54:03.313
MARISHA: Stop hitting yourself!

01:54:03.313 --> 01:54:09.865
TALIESIN: Thank you for that. I was almost going
there.

01:54:09.865 --> 01:54:13.145
MATT: She's right there, and she brings herself
around the way. She's not able to do any actions,

01:54:13.145 --> 01:54:20.247
so she sees another of her brothers possessed but
clutching the gun in the hand, and is steeling her

01:54:20.247 --> 01:54:23.868
blade for the moment and doesn't do anything with
her turn. Grog, you're up.

01:54:23.936 --> 01:54:27.187
TRAVIS: "Percy!" And I run towards him.

01:54:27.187 --> 01:54:34.736
TALIESIN: (creepy voice) I'll swallow your soul!

01:54:34.736 --> 01:54:36.456
TRAVIS: 25.

01:54:36.456 --> 01:54:39.100
TALIESIN: Is no one a Sam Raimi fan? Never mind.

01:54:39.100 --> 01:54:40.601
SAM: That was Donald Duck, right?

01:54:40.601 --> 01:54:41.619
TRAVIS: 18?

01:54:41.619 --> 01:54:43.042
MATT: What's your armor class?

01:54:43.042 --> 01:54:43.902
TALIESIN: 18.

01:54:43.902 --> 01:54:45.436
MATT: Yeah, hits. Damage on both.

01:54:45.436 --> 01:54:55.714
TRAVIS: 17 for the first one. 19 for the second
one.

01:54:55.714 --> 01:55:05.556
MATT: Okay, so 36 points of damage. (two impacts)
You're thrown up against the wall and almost

01:55:05.556 --> 01:55:08.708
pushed over off your feet from the sheer weight of
the impact.

01:55:08.708 --> 01:55:10.411
TALIESIN: It has to be magic damage, though.

01:55:10.411 --> 01:55:11.779
LAURA: It was. It's a magic war hammer.

01:55:11.779 --> 01:55:15.516
TALIESIN: Okay, so it's taking damage, too. That's
good. Maybe.

01:55:15.516 --> 01:55:16.999
MARISHA: They have to be spells.

01:55:16.999 --> 01:55:18.453
TRAVIS: There was fire damage.

01:55:18.453 --> 01:55:26.652
MATT: Yeah. It seems that the radiant damage from
the Spirit Guardian spell you're doing has been

01:55:26.652 --> 01:55:31.250
doing the bulk of damage to them while they're
inside the form. Most everything else is going

01:55:31.250 --> 01:55:32.674
straight to the individual.

01:55:32.674 --> 01:55:34.109
TRAVIS and SAM: Oh shit!

01:55:34.109 --> 01:55:36.753
SAM: We've just been killing our friends for no
reason?

01:55:36.753 --> 01:55:38.078
LAURA: Good times.

01:55:38.078 --> 01:55:40.970
TRAVIS: Let's pass our--

01:55:40.970 --> 01:55:42.762
SAM: Hold our wrath.

01:55:42.762 --> 01:55:48.068
MATT: Percy. You have three more shots with this
gun, two of which are magical.

01:55:48.068 --> 01:55:49.366
TALIESIN: I do.

01:55:49.366 --> 01:55:53.855
MATT: So you pull up the gun, you take a step
back.

01:55:53.855 --> 01:55:57.785
TALIESIN: Does he get an attack of opportunity?

01:55:57.785 --> 01:56:01.319
MATT: You do. Attack of opportunity against Percy,
if you want to take it.

01:56:01.319 --> 01:56:02.555
MARISHA: Come on, take him down.

01:56:02.555 --> 01:56:04.007
LAURA: Oh no!

01:56:04.007 --> 01:56:05.324
TRAVIS: That's a natural 20.

01:56:05.324 --> 01:56:06.218
TALIESIN: Yes!

01:56:06.218 --> 01:56:07.265
MATT: Roll damage.

01:56:07.265 --> 01:56:11.216
TRAVIS: That's actually the first time I've
critted on this show.

01:56:11.216 --> 01:56:13.377
MATT: You get additional dice.

01:56:13.377 --> 01:56:14.753
TRAVIS: It does additional damage.

01:56:14.753 --> 01:56:16.868
MATT: It's the first time you've critically hit on
this show?

01:56:16.868 --> 01:56:18.185
TRAVIS: I think so, because I've never doubled my
dice.

01:56:18.185 --> 01:56:19.812
MATT: That's absurd.

01:56:19.812 --> 01:56:22.770
TRAVIS: I know. 14.

01:56:22.770 --> 01:56:24.571
TALIESIN: 14? I'm already out.

01:56:24.571 --> 01:56:26.765
MATT: Roll damage. I want to know what it is.

01:56:26.765 --> 01:56:28.858
TALIESIN: Yeah, go ahead, but I'm out.

01:56:28.858 --> 01:56:35.948
TRAVIS: 18, so-- what was the first one? 18 and?

01:56:35.948 --> 01:56:37.085
MARISHA: You said 14.

01:56:37.085 --> 01:56:43.154
MATT: Okay. You are out. Percy falls to the
ground, unconscious. The spirit is jettisoned out

01:56:43.154 --> 01:56:52.670
the side. That ends your turn entirely. The ghost
is going to shift over. It does not get its

01:56:52.670 --> 01:56:54.186
possession back.

01:56:54.186 --> 01:56:58.284
TALIESIN: It was just a crit. It wasn't hit
twice.

01:56:58.284 --> 01:57:00.079
MARISHA: It wasn't when he was down.

01:57:00.079 --> 01:57:03.866
MATT: Percy, I need you to make a death saving
throw, by the way.

01:57:03.866 --> 01:57:06.105
TALIESIN: Yay!

01:57:06.105 --> 01:57:13.393
MATT: Okay. The ghost gets pushed out of the body.
With you on the ground and its possession not

01:57:13.393 --> 01:57:16.151
returned, it reaches down and strikes at you with
its withering touch.

01:57:16.151 --> 01:57:17.359
TALIESIN: Oh, for the love of--

01:57:17.359 --> 01:57:18.491
MARISHA: With its withering touch?

01:57:18.491 --> 01:57:21.797
MATT: You take two death saving throw losses.

01:57:21.797 --> 01:57:23.088
TALIESIN: Whoa!

01:57:23.088 --> 01:57:24.199
LAURA: He rolled a crit?

01:57:24.199 --> 01:57:25.770
MATT: It's an auto-crit because he's unconscious.

01:57:25.770 --> 01:57:27.665
LAURA: Oh, jeez Louise!

01:57:27.665 --> 01:57:29.444
MARISHA: But you passed your first one.

01:57:29.444 --> 01:57:30.676
TALIESIN: I passed my first one.

01:57:30.676 --> 01:57:31.846
MARISHA: So you have two failures on you?

01:57:31.846 --> 01:57:38.090
TALIESIN: I have two failures and one success. So
guys? Heal me. Heal me now.

01:57:38.090 --> 01:57:39.702
MATT: Vax, you're up.

01:57:39.702 --> 01:57:48.042
LIAM: I start sprinting around that open hallway
near Cassandra. I stop by Cassandra and dagger,

01:57:48.042 --> 01:57:49.661
dagger, dagger.

01:57:49.661 --> 01:57:51.154
MATT: Do it.

01:57:51.154 --> 01:57:57.445
LIAM: First one is 30. Second one is 15. Third is
28.

01:57:57.445 --> 01:57:58.895
MATT: All three hit.

01:57:58.895 --> 01:58:10.867
LIAM: They all hit? Good. Ten plus seven is 17. 27
total.

01:58:10.867 --> 01:58:13.342
MATT: 27 damage, total?

01:58:13.342 --> 01:58:14.447
LIAM: All magic.

01:58:14.447 --> 01:58:19.083
MATT: All righty, so all daggers strike through
its form. You see it tearing through its ethereal

01:58:19.083 --> 01:58:22.905
physicality, but it's still holding its form
together. It looks damaged, but it's still holding

01:58:22.905 --> 01:58:26.223
its form on this plane. Scanlan, you're up.

01:58:26.223 --> 01:58:29.767
SAM: I vault over Keyleth--

01:58:29.767 --> 01:58:34.820
LIAM: Wait. I ran 20 feet? 30 feet?

01:58:34.820 --> 01:58:39.421
MATT: You were here, so 35.

01:58:39.421 --> 01:58:42.400
LIAM: 35? Can I run the "west" of the way--

01:58:42.400 --> 01:58:44.122
LAURA: The "west" of the way?

01:58:44.122 --> 01:58:48.838
LIAM: The "west" of the way through it in front of
Percy. Yeah.

01:58:48.838 --> 01:58:50.320
MATT: There? You can, yeah.

01:58:50.320 --> 01:58:51.587
LIAM: That's what I want to do.

01:58:51.587 --> 01:58:54.955
MATT: All right. Scanlan?

01:58:54.955 --> 01:59:04.179
SAM: I vault over Keyleth's body, using the right
part of a buttcheek to launch off. Grab a little

01:59:04.179 --> 01:59:05.691
feel as I go.

01:59:05.691 --> 01:59:07.182
MATT: Creepy gnome.

01:59:07.182 --> 01:59:10.569
SAM: I try to get within 15 feet of the thing.

01:59:10.569 --> 01:59:11.914
MATT: Okay.

01:59:11.914 --> 01:59:25.753
SAM: And as my first thing, I will Healing Word
Mr. Taliesin Jaffe. Percival de Rolo de Monico de

01:59:25.753 --> 01:59:27.350
Chico...

01:59:27.350 --> 01:59:29.317
TALIESIN: (sings) It's delightful, it's
de-lovely.

01:59:29.317 --> 01:59:37.954
SAM: Just at normal level, so that's nine points.

01:59:37.954 --> 01:59:39.719
TALIESIN: Thank you!

01:59:39.719 --> 01:59:41.255
MATT: Your death saving throws are fine.

01:59:41.255 --> 01:59:44.239
TALIESIN: Nine. Nine points! Ah-ah-ah.

01:59:44.239 --> 01:59:48.951
SAM: Jesus. I don't want to burn another fucking
thing on this guy.

01:59:48.951 --> 01:59:55.816
TALIESIN: Your aura thingy with 15 feet should do
it.

01:59:55.816 --> 02:00:02.623
SAM: I know, but that's when he moves, not when I
move, so I will mock him! I will say, you're not

02:00:02.623 --> 02:00:13.219
even corporeal. You have no substance. You're a
nothing. You're a nobody! You won't amount to

02:00:13.219 --> 02:00:14.779
nothing in this world!

02:00:14.779 --> 02:00:17.957
(laughter)

02:00:17.957 --> 02:00:20.948
MATT: Okay.

02:00:20.948 --> 02:00:23.111
TRAVIS: (laughing) You're a nothing. You're a
nobody!

02:00:23.111 --> 02:00:24.800
MATT: What's the DC on that?

02:00:24.800 --> 02:00:26.229
SAM: 19.

02:00:26.229 --> 02:00:29.470
MATT: It fails its save. Roll 3d4.

02:00:29.470 --> 02:00:31.922
MARISHA: Kill it, Scanlan. Kill it.

02:00:31.922 --> 02:00:35.083
SAM: Six.

02:00:35.133 --> 02:00:36.722
MATT: (laughing) How do you want to do this?

02:00:36.722 --> 02:00:38.577
(cheers and laughter)

02:00:38.577 --> 02:00:40.112
TRAVIS: A mocking kill!

02:00:40.112 --> 02:00:44.929
SAM: (giggles) I would like it to cry. That's
all.

02:00:44.929 --> 02:00:50.031
MATT: (laughs) As you're shouting this, you can
see its ghostly form. Its face suddenly shifts

02:00:50.031 --> 02:00:53.747
into the face of a person.

02:00:53.747 --> 02:00:56.176
SAM: You were nothing in life, and now you're
nothing in death!

02:00:56.176 --> 02:01:02.624
MATT: It recalls its memories. You can see its
physical form become that of a young adult wearing

02:01:02.624 --> 02:01:08.200
robes that hold the symbol of the de Rolo crest.
You see it look at its hands, and you see it look

02:01:08.200 --> 02:01:13.952
at you and look at Percy on the ground,
unconscious, and it moans out in horror as it

02:01:13.952 --> 02:01:15.120
suddenly dissipates.

02:01:15.120 --> 02:01:16.808
SAM: I'm sorry, I didn't mean it!

02:01:16.808 --> 02:01:21.909
TALIESIN: Which one of my ancestors did you just
shame to death? Again?

02:01:21.909 --> 02:01:23.520
SAM: The one who possessed you!

02:01:23.520 --> 02:01:24.597
TALIESIN: Okay, fair.

02:01:24.597 --> 02:01:28.650
MARISHA: Again! (laughs)

02:01:28.650 --> 02:01:33.032
TALIESIN: You're going to say it, aren't you?

02:01:33.032 --> 02:01:37.168
LIAM: I double back to Keyleth and start trying to
administer some sort of aid.

02:01:37.168 --> 02:01:38.443
MARISHA: Hi, I'm dead.

02:01:38.443 --> 02:01:39.842
LIAM: Medicine check? Is that it?

02:01:39.842 --> 02:01:42.663
MATT: You can make a medicine check to try to
stabilize her, yeah.

02:01:42.663 --> 02:01:43.825
LIAM: 18.

02:01:43.825 --> 02:01:46.981
MATT: 18, yeah. You stabilize the bleeding. She's
no longer making death saving throws. She is still

02:01:46.981 --> 02:01:52.814
unconscious. You all reconvene. Take a breath.

02:01:52.814 --> 02:01:54.001
SAM: Wait, is Keyleth alive?

02:01:54.001 --> 02:01:54.825
MARISHA: Nope.

02:01:54.825 --> 02:01:55.903
SAM: Oh Jesus! Keyleth, I'm sorry.

02:01:55.903 --> 02:01:57.711
MARISHA: I'm stabilized.

02:01:57.711 --> 02:01:59.841
LIAM: She needs help. Scanlan, come here.

02:01:59.841 --> 02:02:01.678
TALIESIN: Let's pull ourselves together.

02:02:01.678 --> 02:02:08.169
SAM: I will sing a song of rest, which will give
us 1d8 for everybody.

02:02:08.169 --> 02:02:11.180
MATT: For hit dice spent, or just for the rest?

02:02:11.180 --> 02:02:15.171
SAM: I don't know. It just says 1d8. It's my song
of rest.

02:02:15.171 --> 02:02:16.440
MATT: Song of rest.

02:02:16.440 --> 02:02:18.226
TRAVIS: I've got a lot of health potions.

02:02:18.226 --> 02:02:20.978
MARISHA: You do?

02:02:20.978 --> 02:02:21.911
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:02:21.911 --> 02:02:22.888
MARISHA: That's good.

02:02:22.888 --> 02:02:24.382
TALIESIN: I've got three.

02:02:24.382 --> 02:02:25.411
TRAVIS: Would you like one?

02:02:25.411 --> 02:02:26.450
TALIESIN: Probably.

02:02:26.450 --> 02:02:27.877
LAURA: What if we take a short rest?

02:02:27.877 --> 02:02:34.136
MATT: At the end of the short rest, everyone gains
an additional 1d8. It's nice. Doesn't hurt.

02:02:34.136 --> 02:02:37.501
MARISHA: I come to consciousness by Scanlan's
singing?

02:02:37.501 --> 02:02:42.363
SAM: (singing) You're down with more HP. Yeah, you
know me!

02:02:42.453 --> 02:02:44.401
TALIESIN: That's nice.

02:02:44.449 --> 02:02:45.535
MARISHA: What?

02:02:45.535 --> 02:02:46.716
TRAVIS: Hit dice?

02:02:46.716 --> 02:02:47.940
LAURA: Yeah, we can roll some hit dice.

02:02:47.940 --> 02:02:49.458
MATT: You guys take a short rest here to roll some
hit dice.

02:02:49.458 --> 02:02:53.428
MARISHA: (groans) Wait, how much did you heal us,
Scanlan?

02:02:53.428 --> 02:02:57.426
SAM: Just one extra d8. Do I roll that, or do
they?

02:02:57.426 --> 02:02:59.177
MATT: Everyone rolls it on their own. It's fine.

02:02:59.177 --> 02:03:09.554
SAM: Holy ba-Jesus, guys.

02:03:09.554 --> 02:03:10.955
LAURA: That was insane.

02:03:10.955 --> 02:03:12.735
SAM: Can we never do that again?

02:03:12.735 --> 02:03:14.883
LAURA: Well, we're about to, I think.

02:03:14.883 --> 02:03:19.528
LIAM: Who feels like making camp?

02:03:19.528 --> 02:03:21.609
SAM: Making camp?

02:03:21.609 --> 02:03:22.589
LIAM: Yes.

02:03:22.589 --> 02:03:26.062
SAM: We're in a tomb with ghosts. We have to
continue on.

02:03:26.062 --> 02:03:27.357
LIAM: I'm exhausted.

02:03:27.357 --> 02:03:31.600
TALIESIN: We'll heal, but I think we need to
continue down.

02:03:31.600 --> 02:03:33.648
LAURA: We need to keep going.

02:03:33.648 --> 02:03:43.537
MATT: Cassandra looks about the rest of you, still
seeing a group of herself and her brothers. She

02:03:43.537 --> 02:03:48.696
shakes her head for a second. "We can rest a
moment, but I don't think we can stay here much

02:03:48.696 --> 02:03:53.477
"longer. The more time we spend here, the more
chance they have of returning. If they get the

02:03:53.477 --> 02:03:56.436
"jump on us, we're done."

02:03:56.436 --> 02:03:57.816
TRAVIS: Let's go.

02:03:57.816 --> 02:03:59.980
LAURA: We need to press on.

02:03:59.980 --> 02:04:02.137
SAM: Yeah, aye.

02:04:02.137 --> 02:04:03.331
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:04:03.331 --> 02:04:04.407
SAM: Let's continue.

02:04:04.407 --> 02:04:05.260
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:04:05.260 --> 02:04:06.901
SAM: Into the tunnel. Into the dark.

02:04:06.901 --> 02:04:15.282
MATT: She sheathes her sword and her dagger.
(sighs) "Let's do this." As you all climb into the

02:04:15.282 --> 02:04:20.190
beginning of the excavation tunnel leading to 
the south, slowly making your way towards--

02:04:20.233 --> 02:04:24.807
SAM: Wait! Sorry. Percival, any point in looting?

02:04:24.807 --> 02:04:28.428
TALIESIN: Don't loot my family's crypt!

02:04:28.428 --> 02:04:32.106
SAM: Sorry! Forget I mentioned it. Let's go kick
some ass.

02:04:32.106 --> 02:04:37.821
MATT: Making your way towards the tunnels beneath
the city of Whitestone, towards whatever this

02:04:37.821 --> 02:04:43.976
ziggurat construction project has been, we will
pick this up the week after Thanksgiving.

02:04:43.976 --> 02:04:46.250
LAURA: Oh man! We're taking a whole week off from
this.

02:04:46.250 --> 02:04:49.579
MATT: Yeah. We went a little late tonight to try
and give a little extra since we're not going to

02:04:49.579 --> 02:04:52.933
be here next week, but that's it for the evening.

02:04:52.975 --> 02:04:57.592
MARISHA: We almost got our ass kicked by ghosts!

02:04:57.592 --> 02:04:59.414
SAM: No, by each other.

02:04:59.414 --> 02:05:00.824
LAURA: We really need a cleric.

02:05:00.824 --> 02:05:05.008
MATT: There were some really bad-- everyone rolled
poorly on those saving throws.

02:05:05.008 --> 02:05:07.077
That sucked. Oh, yes!

02:05:07.077 --> 02:05:09.390
LAURA: Oh, man. Right. Giveaways.

02:05:09.390 --> 02:05:13.446
ZAC: We've got to do a giveaway, so I am opening
the floodgates.

02:05:13.446 --> 02:05:16.676
TALIESIN: Welcome, all!

02:05:16.676 --> 02:05:18.437
LAURA: The whole time.

02:05:18.437 --> 02:05:25.875
TALIESIN: This is Twitch. Holy cow.

02:05:25.875 --> 02:05:28.781
MARISHA: I might need to burn a Cure Wounds or
something.

02:05:28.781 --> 02:05:30.781
TALIESIN: I'm not at a hundred, but I'm okay.

02:05:30.781 --> 02:05:35.751
MARISHA: I burned almost all of my hit dice to
bring me back up.

02:05:35.751 --> 02:05:40.813
TALIESIN: Ashley is getting home right now, in
case we need her.

02:05:40.813 --> 02:05:41.777
LAURA: Yeah.

02:05:41.777 --> 02:05:43.691
MATT: We're good.

02:05:43.691 --> 02:05:45.186
TRAVIS: Are we?

02:05:45.186 --> 02:05:48.550
TALIESIN: Can she come in for 30 seconds and heal
us?

02:05:48.550 --> 02:05:51.302
MATT: (laughs) It doesn't work that way.

02:05:51.302 --> 02:05:52.374
TALIESIN: I know.

02:05:52.374 --> 02:05:56.678
MARISHA: Guys, I got a little bit of a connection!
And gone. That's all.

02:05:56.678 --> 02:06:03.549
ZAC: We also got up to $6,000 total so far,
raised.

02:06:03.549 --> 02:06:05.318
LAURA: Oh wow, that's great!

02:06:05.318 --> 02:06:06.454
MATT: Incredible!

02:06:06.454 --> 02:06:10.191
ZAC: So we will continue that throughout the
weekend, all the way up to Monday.

02:06:10.191 --> 02:06:12.675
MATT: Thank you all so much for helping out.

02:06:12.675 --> 02:06:13.737
TALIESIN: Holy cow.

02:06:13.737 --> 02:06:17.388
MATT: You're helping a lot of wonderful people do
a lot of amazing things in places that need it.

02:06:17.388 --> 02:06:23.265
ZAC: So the floodgates are open. We're going to
let that build up for a little bit and then do the

02:06:23.265 --> 02:06:24.357
giveaway.

02:06:24.357 --> 02:06:27.853
MATT: Oh! Chat room explode!

02:06:27.853 --> 02:06:33.320
ZAC: Oh shoot, that's true. The next episode is
Critmas, as well, isn't it?

02:06:33.320 --> 02:06:34.631
LAURA and TALIESIN: No.

02:06:34.631 --> 02:06:36.168
ZAC: Is there not? There's one before it?

02:06:36.168 --> 02:06:37.470
LAURA: No, there's another one before.

02:06:37.470 --> 02:06:38.419
ZAC: Are you sure?

02:06:38.419 --> 02:06:39.314
TALIESIN: No.

02:06:39.314 --> 02:06:48.537
MARISHA: No, we're doing the Christmas Critmas a
little bit earlier, so we're going to do the next

02:06:48.537 --> 02:06:50.481
one before we go on Christmas break, right?

02:06:50.481 --> 02:06:58.205
MATT: No, the 3rd is the next Critmas. Because the
17th, our last show, is also the opening night of

02:06:58.205 --> 02:07:03.052
the new Star Wars movie, we can't go late that
night because everyone's going to be gone.

02:07:03.052 --> 02:07:06.859
LAURA: Oh. So yeah, we can't do Critmas next
week.

02:07:06.859 --> 02:07:09.253
ZAC: Next week's Thanksgiving.

02:07:09.253 --> 02:07:10.911
LAURA: I mean, on the 3rd.

02:07:10.911 --> 02:07:14.488
ZAC: And we've already told everyone the first
week of the month is--

02:07:14.488 --> 02:07:18.523
SAM: So the Christmas Critmas is going to be the
3rd.

02:07:18.523 --> 02:07:19.640
MATT: It's going to be the 3rd.

02:07:19.640 --> 02:07:20.522
LAURA: December 3rd?

02:07:20.522 --> 02:07:21.295
ZAC: Yes.

02:07:21.295 --> 02:07:22.549
TALIESIN: Yeah, that will be the Crit--

02:07:22.549 --> 02:07:26.001
ZAC: Math is hard, guys.

02:07:26.001 --> 02:07:28.384
MATT: Welcome to our late-night meetings.

02:07:28.384 --> 02:07:30.390
(all laugh)

02:07:30.435 --> 02:07:31.966
ZAC: All right, pull in a winner.

02:07:31.966 --> 02:07:33.332
MATT: We've got a winner coming in.

02:07:33.332 --> 02:07:36.626
LAURA: Can't we just do it the second week? It's
going to be a long episode. We'll have to cut it

02:07:36.626 --> 02:07:37.566
super short.

02:07:37.566 --> 02:07:39.561
MARISHA: That's what I was thinking. Can we move
it to the second week?

02:07:39.561 --> 02:07:41.531
TALIESIN: Move it to the 10th.

02:07:41.531 --> 02:07:43.391
MARISHA: Christmas Critmas is going to be the
10th.

02:07:43.391 --> 02:07:46.582
ZAC: Before we officially say that, let me check
the schedule, because we've already told everyone

02:07:46.582 --> 02:07:50.893
the first week, so before we say that officially,
let me check the schedule and make sure that's

02:07:50.893 --> 02:07:51.705
okay.

02:07:51.705 --> 02:07:53.173
LAURA: It's going to be really hard to do it on
the 3rd.

02:07:53.173 --> 02:07:53.974
ZAC: Okay.

02:07:53.974 --> 02:07:56.113
TALIESIN: I'm literally leaving the studio on the
17th for a road trip.

02:07:56.113 --> 02:07:57.744
ZAC: IEShoemaker is the winner.

02:07:57.744 --> 02:07:59.688
MATT: IEShoemaker, congratulations!

02:07:59.688 --> 02:08:04.554
ZAC: We're sending you a message right now. Send
back with your address and we'll send you all

02:08:04.554 --> 02:08:11.444
sorts of great shit. Tune in tomorrow, guys, for
Group Hug. Hector's bringing a couple of comedian

02:08:11.444 --> 02:08:17.441
friends of his, and they are playing all of the
Jessica Jones Alias characters tomorrow, and

02:08:17.441 --> 02:08:22.959
nobody wanted to play Purple Man.

02:08:22.959 --> 02:08:24.166
MATT: Understandably so.

02:08:24.166 --> 02:08:25.887
TALIESIN: Creepiest character in the Marvel
universe.

02:08:25.887 --> 02:08:27.088
ZAC: How do we do this?

02:08:27.088 --> 02:08:28.334
TALIESIN: He is the creepiest creep.

02:08:28.435 --> 02:08:30.900
ZAC: Whoever plays him has to know you're going to
get your ass kicked.

02:08:30.900 --> 02:08:31.975
MATT: That's Tennant, right?

02:08:31.975 --> 02:08:36.838
TALIESIN: That's Tennant. That's also who I
dressed up as at the superhero party. I painted

02:08:36.838 --> 02:08:38.191
myself purple.

02:08:38.191 --> 02:08:40.206
ZAC: You did Purple Man? Why would you do that?!

02:08:40.206 --> 02:08:43.961
TALIESIN: There's an amazing photo of a friend of
ours dressed as Luke Cage, just beating the shit

02:08:43.961 --> 02:08:45.062
out of me. It's amazing.

02:08:45.062 --> 02:08:46.157
ZAC: Well, that's good.

02:08:46.157 --> 02:08:47.847
MARISHA: He also sang Gogol Bordello's--

02:08:47.847 --> 02:08:49.210
MARISHA and TALIESIN: "Start Wearing Purple."

02:08:49.210 --> 02:08:50.877
MATT: It was good.

02:08:50.877 --> 02:08:52.587
TALIESIN: It was creepy.

02:08:52.587 --> 02:08:56.906
MATT: I'm just excited to see all the Doctor Who
Tennant fans watch the series for Tennant and then

02:08:56.906 --> 02:08:59.905
be like, "Oh no, no, no!"

02:08:59.905 --> 02:09:04.516
ZAC: Yeah. Sorry, guys. No bueno.

02:09:04.516 --> 02:09:06.727
TALIESIN: It's just going to be bad.

02:09:06.727 --> 02:09:09.169
ZAC: Sweet. That's it for tonight, guys.

02:09:09.169 --> 02:09:10.358
MATT: Thank you guys so much.

02:09:10.358 --> 02:09:12.179
MARISHA: See you in two weeks!

02:09:12.179 --> 02:09:14.000
MATT: For the next episode. See you guys in two weeks.

02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:15.138
TALIESIN: Happy Thanksgiving!

02:09:15.138 --> 02:09:21.414
MARISHA: There will still be a new comic next week
to hold you guys over. And playlists. Guess whose

02:09:21.457 --> 02:09:22.933
playlist is next.

02:09:24.885 --> 02:09:26.187

02:09:26.187 --> 02:09:27.457

02:09:29.895 --> 02:09:31.807

always go last.

02:09:31.807 --> 02:09:34.385
MATT: All right, guys. Thank you so much. Have a
wonderful evening.

02:09:34.385 --> 02:09:35.463
We'll see you in a couple of weeks.
