00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.741
MATT: -- tonight's episode of Critical Role, where
a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around

00:00:04.741 --> 00:00:10.669
and play Dungeons and Dragons. We are down one
Sam, unfortunately, tonight, so Scanlan will be

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:20.335
Jaeger-piloted by Keyleth and Percy over there,
and Pike is still in New York, but in trade, we do

00:00:20.335 --> 00:00:22.642
have Rothfuss joining us this week via Skype.

00:00:22.642 --> 00:00:24.097
(cheering)

00:00:24.097 --> 00:00:28.244
MATT: To continue the journey of Kerrek along with
these crazy kids.

00:00:28.244 --> 00:00:30.562
So thank you for joining us, Patrick.

00:00:30.562 --> 00:00:33.645
LIAM: Look at his beautiful office and all his
beautiful owlbears.

00:00:33.645 --> 00:00:35.103
MARISHA: So many owlbears!

00:00:35.103 --> 00:00:40.652
MATT: It's beautiful. Cool, so before we get into
the game tonight, let's go ahead and do our

00:00:40.652 --> 00:00:46.410
announcements. First and foremost, we are starting
with our first official sponsorship of the year

00:00:46.588 --> 00:00:54.221
with the return of Lootcrate. Thank you so much
for being amazing supporters of the show and we're

00:00:54.221 --> 00:00:57.550
excited to get started. Liam, you wanted to talk
about this one?

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:02.875
LIAM: Oh my gosh, Sam is not here and I got asked
to do something ten minutes ago. This is gonna be

00:01:02.875 --> 00:01:08.315
so good. In Sam and Lootcrate's honor, I have
written a limerick. I think you'll all approve.

00:01:08.315 --> 00:01:13.469
And then I'll tell you a little bit about
Lootcrate, but first, some Irish poetry. Sam's

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:19.190
style is not what you'd call quaint, let's be
honest, my man is no saint, but Lootcrate is

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:23.007
happy, his pitch plans are snappy, singing songs
about fisting and taint.

00:01:23.007 --> 00:01:25.913
(laughter)

00:01:25.913 --> 00:01:33.455
LIAM: Okay! So Lootcrate, the January theme is not
'taint' or 'fisting', it's 'origins'. The brands

00:01:33.455 --> 00:01:40.726
are Superman, Marvel, TMNT, Nintendo, I know
everyone here's familiar. The cutoff-- you have to

00:01:40.726 --> 00:01:43.244
order now, the cutoff is 9PM tonight.

00:01:43.244 --> 00:01:44.553
MATT: 9PM tonight.

00:01:44.553 --> 00:01:50.449
LIAM: So you gotta go get got, and you want to go
to lootcrate.com/criticalrole. Not critrole, but

00:01:50.449 --> 00:01:55.933
lootcrate.com/criticalrole. And the promo code is
'criticalrole', one word,

00:01:55.933 --> 00:01:58.647
for 10% off your first month.

00:01:58.647 --> 00:02:00.047
MATT: Rockin'.

00:02:00.047 --> 00:02:01.373
LIAM: Also taint.

00:02:01.373 --> 00:02:04.496
LAURA: Thank you, Lootcrate. We're glad to have
you back.

00:02:04.496 --> 00:02:09.005
MATT: We can't talk about the taint theme. That
doesn't happen until April.

00:02:09.005 --> 00:02:13.028
LAURA: So excited about it, though. Just so
excited.

00:02:13.028 --> 00:02:15.416
LIAM: There are some exclusives.

00:02:15.416 --> 00:02:22.614
MATT: There are some inclusives. So anyway. I also
wanted to give a shout-out to Blue Mics, Blue

00:02:22.614 --> 00:02:27.525
Microphones, they have been fantastic and sent us
a bunch of new equipment here to start upgrading

00:02:27.525 --> 00:02:32.998
the audio quality of our fantastic show here and
us personally, as voice actors, I myself have used

00:02:32.998 --> 00:02:39.080
Blues for quite a long time for home auditions and
I'm hoping that the one that now sits before me

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:44.880
will give you a little bit of a better boost from
my usual audio. So thank you guys so much, Blue

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.960
Mics, for helping support us here. If you're
interested at all in checking out their awesome

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:53.052
audio equipment, you can go to them at
bluemic.com. That's B-L-U-E-M-I-C.com.

00:02:53.052 --> 00:02:54.252
Thank you guys.

00:02:54.252 --> 00:02:56.569
TALIESIN: I cannot say enough good stuff.

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:01.022
MATT: Laura, you wanted to talk about stuff?

00:03:01.022 --> 00:03:05.986
LAURA: Oh my gosh. Okay, okay, okay, I'll stop
rolling for a second, because we have these new

00:03:05.986 --> 00:03:08.568
things in the store, and they're socks.

00:03:08.568 --> 00:03:10.622
(gasping)

00:03:10.622 --> 00:03:15.993
LAURA: I know, I know, I put 'em in front of
everybody. They don't smell yet, 'cause nobody's

00:03:15.993 --> 00:03:20.949
worn them. They should be in the store right now.
They say 'how do you want to do this?' and they've

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:26.429
got the logo on it, and if they do well, then
maybe we'll think about releasing some Sox Machina

00:03:26.429 --> 00:03:34.703
in all the different characters. I know, it's
exciting, it's fun. And also, the dice are still

00:03:34.703 --> 00:03:39.216
in the works, those should be coming up soon,
hopefully by this month, maybe next month, but

00:03:39.216 --> 00:03:44.513
they will be back in the store. We have pins, we
have bracelets, limited stock of those are back in

00:03:44.513 --> 00:03:48.524
the store, too, so. That's so exciting. And all
the other things that I've been announcing every

00:03:48.524 --> 00:03:51.379
week because, you know, we're just so on top of
it, no big deal.

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:55.129
(laughter)

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:56.292
TRAVIS: Can we keep these?

00:03:56.292 --> 00:03:57.583
LAURA: Yeah, no, these are for us.

00:03:57.583 --> 00:03:59.395
TRAVIS: Yay! These will stink in a week.

00:03:59.395 --> 00:04:02.664
MATT: Please bring them back next week and show
us.

00:04:02.664 --> 00:04:06.233
LAURA: Can I just tell everybody how much I miss
having you next to me, boo?

00:04:06.233 --> 00:04:07.504
MARISHA: Aww.

00:04:07.504 --> 00:04:09.482
LAURA: I'm sad you're not over here.

00:04:09.482 --> 00:04:11.595
TRAVIS: Oh, we're not in character yet, right? I
miss you too.

00:04:11.595 --> 00:04:21.073
MATT: Aww. Stop it. Next thing I want to announce
is there's a convention coming up in February

00:04:21.073 --> 00:04:28.954
called Anime Milwaukee, February 17-19, in which
me, Marisha, Travis, and Laura will be in

00:04:28.954 --> 00:04:34.513
attendance as guests. So come join us for an
awesome Critical Role panel, we'll have signings

00:04:34.513 --> 00:04:38.235
throughout the weekend, our other panels about
voiceover and other elements of chaos. So if

00:04:38.235 --> 00:04:41.559
you're in that area, please come and say hi. Bring
things for us to sign.

00:04:41.559 --> 00:04:45.815
TRAVIS: Yeah, bring a bathing suit, I hear there's
a pool party on Saturdays in the

00:04:45.815 --> 00:04:47.591
negative-two-degree weather.

00:04:47.591 --> 00:04:49.185
LAURA: Oh, god. Is it really that cold?

00:04:49.185 --> 00:04:50.722
TRAVIS: I don't know. It's Milwaukee.

00:04:50.722 --> 00:04:55.337
MARISHA: Yeah, it's by the lake, too, you got that
lake-effect air.

00:04:55.337 --> 00:05:03.750
MATT: Dress warm, just in case. Anything else
anyone wishes to discuss or mention? Patrick,

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:05.682
anything you wanna mention?

00:05:05.682 --> 00:05:09.822
PATRICK: You guys are coming to my state? You're
gonna be in Wisconsin? When's that?

00:05:09.822 --> 00:05:12.451
MATT: That is February 17-19.

00:05:12.451 --> 00:05:13.889
TRAVIS: But we're not gonna see you.

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:15.875
(laughter)

00:05:15.875 --> 00:05:18.387
PATRICK: You act like you have a choice.

00:05:18.387 --> 00:05:20.496
(laughter)

00:05:20.496 --> 00:05:23.051
MATT: So yeah. Come see us!

00:05:23.051 --> 00:05:28.300
PATRICK: I'll see, I'll check my calendar to see,
that'll be a short trip if you're just down in

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:29.426
Milwaukee.

00:05:29.426 --> 00:05:31.153
LAURA: Oh my gosh, Patrick dinner.

00:05:31.153 --> 00:05:33.249
PATRICK: That would be awesome.

00:05:33.249 --> 00:05:39.898
MATT: So look for a bearded fellow with sunglasses
and a hoodie at the convention. Well, cool. Thank

00:05:39.898 --> 00:05:44.151
you guys so much. Now that our announcements are
done, let's go ahead and dive in to tonight's

00:05:44.151 --> 00:05:47.357
episode of Critical Role.

00:05:47.357 --> 00:06:46.464
[no audio]

00:06:46.464 --> 00:07:17.585
[dramatic music]

00:07:17.585 --> 00:07:26.953
MATT: And welcome back. (laughs) Yeah, that was a
great countdown. So, to bring us into the story,

00:07:26.953 --> 00:07:32.831
and get you guys up to speed, the adventuring
group of Vox Machina had been battling the Chroma

00:07:32.831 --> 00:07:36.561
Conclave, a collection of ancient chromatic
dragons that had terrorized the Tal'Dorei

00:07:36.561 --> 00:07:42.213
countryside, ruined a number of the villages and
cities, their leader, Thordak the Cinderking,

00:07:42.213 --> 00:07:49.119
lording over the capital city of Emon for a number
of weeks at this point. In order to prepare

00:07:49.119 --> 00:07:52.932
themselves for this battle, they have traversed
the planes and all across the world to acquire

00:07:52.932 --> 00:07:58.874
Vestiges of Divergence, these powerful artifacts,
and upon acquiring them and gathering allies, they

00:07:58.874 --> 00:08:02.876
made an assault, with the help of these allies,
upon the city of Emon, defeated Thordak the

00:08:02.876 --> 00:08:07.909
Cinderking, and, after making an alliance with one
of these Conclave members, Raishan, the Diseased

00:08:07.909 --> 00:08:13.442
Deceiver, to aid them in this battle, they ended
up battling Raishan as well within Thordak's lair

00:08:13.442 --> 00:08:20.491
beneath the city. Raishan nearly annihilated the
entirety of the group Vox Machina, kept at bay

00:08:20.491 --> 00:08:26.391
only by them summoning one of their allies, J'mon
Sa Ord, the powerful brass dragon and secret

00:08:26.391 --> 00:08:32.148
leader of the city of Ank'harel. Enough of a
threat to push her away, Raishan took the corpse

00:08:32.148 --> 00:08:37.490
of Thordak, apparently via teleportation, as well
as two of the eggs that remained in the lair, and

00:08:37.490 --> 00:08:44.951
vanished. Upon wrestling your way outside of the
lair itself, you came upon a number of allies who

00:08:44.951 --> 00:08:50.169
had fought their way to the center of the city, as
well as Patrick's character Kerrek, who had

00:08:50.169 --> 00:08:56.254
brought a number of his ragtag adventurers from
the city of Westruun to aid. Kerrek joined you in

00:08:56.254 --> 00:09:00.845
your return to Whitestone, and has now agreed to
aid you in your search for the current whereabouts

00:09:00.845 --> 00:09:08.463
of Raishan. Through the use of some rather rapid
scry magic and the dragon's spent capability to

00:09:08.463 --> 00:09:13.514
defend against it at the time, you found the
location of Raishan, apparently a distant island

00:09:13.514 --> 00:09:21.091
to the far south in the Lucidian Ocean, one that
once was the lair of Thordak before he was sealed,

00:09:21.091 --> 00:09:29.807
and before that, apparently belonged to a
necromancer named Opash. You then spent the

00:09:29.807 --> 00:09:33.988
evening in Whitestone-- or, I guess, the day,
since you slept through the day-- in Whitestone,

00:09:33.988 --> 00:09:39.316
preparing to rest for a coming conflict, giving
chase to Raishan in hopes of stopping whatever her

00:09:39.316 --> 00:09:47.290
plans are before they come to fruition. So. That
is when we dive back in. So all of you guys have

00:09:47.290 --> 00:09:52.312
had a full night's rest, you're back up to your
full hit points, you regain half of your spent hit

00:09:52.312 --> 00:09:59.758
dice. Spells are back. I know we had a few
characters level. We had Scanlan level, Percy

00:09:59.758 --> 00:10:01.494
levelled, and Pike levelled.

00:10:01.494 --> 00:10:07.119
LAURA: So we're just gonna choose an eighth-level
for Pike, but it won't stick if she wants to not

00:10:07.119 --> 00:10:08.746
have that be it, right?

00:10:08.746 --> 00:10:14.237
MATT: Yeah. Sure. It's fine, as a cleric, you have
access to all the cleric spells.

00:10:14.237 --> 00:10:16.729
LAURA: Oh, so she doesn't have to choose one like
a ranger?

00:10:16.729 --> 00:10:21.820
MATT: No, no, no. That's kind of the benefits of
the cleric and the wizard, is they have a larger

00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:23.267
breadth of spells, druids as well.

00:10:23.267 --> 00:10:25.636
LAURA: Oh, that's great. Well, never mind!

00:10:25.636 --> 00:10:28.560
LIAM: We're gonna pick Power Word Kill Green
Dragon.

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:31.857
LAURA: Yeah, Power Word Kill Green Dragon for her
eighth-level spell.

00:10:31.857 --> 00:10:33.665
MATT: She's taking Power Word Kill?

00:10:33.665 --> 00:10:34.926
LIAM: Green Dragon.

00:10:34.926 --> 00:10:36.256
LAURA: Specifically.

00:10:36.256 --> 00:10:38.488
MARISHA: Can she do that?

00:10:38.488 --> 00:10:39.642
LAURA: No, no.

00:10:39.642 --> 00:10:41.659
MARISHA: Okay. I was just like, is that allowed?

00:10:41.659 --> 00:10:44.157
LIAM: You don't know.

00:10:44.157 --> 00:10:47.484
MARISHA: All right. All right.

00:10:47.484 --> 00:10:53.338
MATT: So. If you guys wanna get your-- any
attunement changes you want to situate for the

00:10:53.338 --> 00:10:56.788
coming party company move.

00:10:56.788 --> 00:11:06.032
LIAM: Yeah. I would like my boots back, and I've
been sort of dreading this moment. Can I have my

00:11:06.032 --> 00:11:07.343
boots back?

00:11:07.343 --> 00:11:11.580
LAURA: They look so good on me. Have you noticed?

00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:17.672
LIAM: It's all I've noticed for the last 24 hours
when we were fighting. I mean, we probably

00:11:17.672 --> 00:11:20.821
would've killed her yesterday, but I was so
distracted by how good

00:11:20.821 --> 00:11:22.824
you looked in the boots, yeah.

00:11:22.824 --> 00:11:24.094
LAURA: I know, I know.

00:11:24.094 --> 00:11:24.871
LIAM: Yeah.

00:11:24.871 --> 00:11:26.100
LAURA: I mean, like, really good.

00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:30.527
LIAM: Strategically, I think I can actually do
more, and I think I'm more likely to get a little

00:11:30.527 --> 00:11:31.981
more bang for my buck out of them.

00:11:31.981 --> 00:11:36.277
LAURA: Oh, really? Strategically, you can do more
than me?

00:11:36.277 --> 00:11:40.435
LIAM: Never mind. I'll use the sword--

00:11:40.435 --> 00:11:43.519
LAURA: No, no, no, I'll give them to you, I'll
give them to you.

00:11:43.519 --> 00:11:46.813
LIAM: That was as painful as I imagined it would
be.

00:11:46.813 --> 00:11:49.032
TRAVIS: It could've been worse.

00:11:49.032 --> 00:11:52.901
LIAM: Yes, it could've been. Percy, would you like
this sword back?

00:11:52.901 --> 00:11:54.489
TALIESIN: You know...

00:11:54.489 --> 00:11:57.327
LIAM: Or anybody. Yeah, the sword.

00:11:57.327 --> 00:11:58.855
LAURA: It's the Dragonkilling sword.

00:11:58.855 --> 00:12:06.454
LIAM: I just, I'm better when I'm maneuverable,
and I feel like I'm gonna get one swing and a miss

00:12:06.454 --> 00:12:08.164
and it go to waste.

00:12:08.164 --> 00:12:11.177
LAURA: Oh, jeez. Who needs it? Can anybody take
it?

00:12:11.177 --> 00:12:13.699
TALIESIN: I will admit, if I get within striking
distance, I'm probably--

00:12:13.699 --> 00:12:14.749
TRAVIS: Can I see it?

00:12:14.749 --> 00:12:19.516
LIAM: Sure you can. Here's the handle.

00:12:19.516 --> 00:12:23.143
MARISHA: Proper handling techniques.

00:12:23.227 --> 00:12:30.138
TRAVIS: What, really? (gasps) I'll have it.

00:12:30.138 --> 00:12:33.613
LAURA: Should I do stealth cloak or should I do--

00:12:33.613 --> 00:12:37.505
MATT: You guys have also taken some time to
inspect the other items that you received from the

00:12:37.505 --> 00:12:38.762
treasure hoard.

00:12:38.762 --> 00:12:41.399
LAURA: Get me out of this bench situation!

00:12:41.452 --> 00:12:43.867
MARISHA: Gimme those, gimme those, gimme those
boots.

00:12:43.867 --> 00:12:48.810
MATT: Boots to Keyleth, and this to whoever, the
hammer.

00:12:48.810 --> 00:12:51.977
TRAVIS: The hammer. There's a hammer?

00:12:51.977 --> 00:12:53.508
MATT: It's a warhammer.

00:12:53.508 --> 00:12:56.731
TRAVIS: What? Who found a warhammer? I was
asleep.

00:12:56.731 --> 00:13:01.397
LAURA: Hold on, hold on, I'll pass it over to you.
I'm not even going to read it, Keyleth.

00:13:01.397 --> 00:13:04.091
TALIESIN: Chapter one.

00:13:04.091 --> 00:13:10.957
LAURA: Okay, wait. The Dwarven Thrower, this is
the warhammer. Okay. You gain a +3 attack bonus,

00:13:10.957 --> 00:13:19.510
bonus to attack and damage rolls. It has a thrown
property. Normal range of 20 feet and a long range

00:13:19.510 --> 00:13:24.949
of 60 feet, Grog. When you hit with a ranged
attack using this weapon, it deals an extra 1d8

00:13:24.949 --> 00:13:30.079
damage or, if the target is Giant, which a dragon
is, 2d8 damage.

00:13:30.079 --> 00:13:31.962
MATT: Like an actual giant.

00:13:31.962 --> 00:13:36.718
LAURA: Oh, 'is a giant'. Never mind. Immediately
after the attack,

00:13:36.718 --> 00:13:38.971
the weapon flies back to your hand.

00:13:38.971 --> 00:13:40.939
LIAM: Another one of those secrets she was telling
me about.

00:13:40.939 --> 00:13:45.847
MATT: Yeah, it's Thor-hammerish. Does require
attunement by a dwarf.

00:13:45.847 --> 00:13:50.433
TRAVIS: What if I've got a dwarvish beard?

00:13:50.433 --> 00:13:58.152
MATT: If you have the Belt of Dwarvenkind attuned,
you can attune to the hammer as well. But only

00:13:58.152 --> 00:14:04.372
under that condition. If you unattune the belt,
you have to unattune the hammer.

00:14:04.372 --> 00:14:07.033
LIAM: And you have to give Matt $20.

00:14:07.033 --> 00:14:09.020
TRAVIS: I'm so happy right now.

00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:11.396
MATT: Yes, that as well. I forgot that on the
card.

00:14:11.396 --> 00:14:14.597
LAURA: Kerrek, are you secretly a dwarf?

00:14:14.597 --> 00:14:20.238
PATRICK: I... no, though the similarity is
notable.

00:14:20.238 --> 00:14:23.240
(laughter)

00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:28.047
LIAM: I noticed you haven't actually given me the
boots back, and I just wanted to remind you--

00:14:28.047 --> 00:14:32.497
LAURA: Oh my god, let me find the fucking piece of
paper. Jeez.

00:14:32.497 --> 00:14:34.862
LIAM: It's very important. I'm also going-- oh,
you go.

00:14:34.862 --> 00:14:41.378
MARISHA: Also, these boots may be good for our
wonderful cleric. These are Boots of Elvenkind.

00:14:41.378 --> 00:14:46.450
While you wear these boots, your steps make no
sound, regardless of the surface you are moving

00:14:46.450 --> 00:14:52.714
across. You also have advantage on dexterity
stealth checks that rely on moving silently.

00:14:52.714 --> 00:14:58.264
LAURA: Oh my gosh, but I don't know what else Pike
has attuned on her.

00:14:58.264 --> 00:15:00.995
MATT: Well, that one I don't think requires
attunement.

00:15:00.995 --> 00:15:07.664
LAURA: (gasps) Pass 'em over, Pike will wear them!
They don't need attune? Wow, I'll write them down

00:15:07.664 --> 00:15:08.961
on her sheet.

00:15:08.961 --> 00:15:12.397
MATT: But she will not have her Boots of
Levitation. Or no, she will not have her

00:15:12.397 --> 00:15:15.319
Sprinter's Boots. Sprinter's Boots will be
replaced by those.

00:15:15.319 --> 00:15:20.549
LIAM: Well, you know, what are the chances that
she's gonna need to bolt? Probably more than sneak

00:15:20.549 --> 00:15:22.387
around. Probably?

00:15:22.387 --> 00:15:24.434
MATT: It's a choice to make.

00:15:24.434 --> 00:15:29.412
LAURA: Okay, here's a question: can she have the
boots on and then right before the battle put on

00:15:29.412 --> 00:15:30.831
the Sprinter's Boots?

00:15:30.831 --> 00:15:32.871
MATT: Sprinter's Boots do require attunement.

00:15:32.871 --> 00:15:35.247
LAURA: And it's not like you can attune them and
then take them off?

00:15:35.247 --> 00:15:37.707
MATT: I'll have to double-check the card from her.
I don't know if they do.

00:15:37.707 --> 00:15:41.457
MARISHA: Sprinter's Boots are pretty clutch for
Pike.

00:15:41.457 --> 00:15:43.941
LAURA: Yeah, they're pretty clutch, especially
after the last time.

00:15:43.941 --> 00:15:46.027
LIAM: We're going to brawl.

00:15:46.027 --> 00:15:49.228
LAURA: But we're going stealthy, probably,
before--

00:15:49.228 --> 00:15:56.800
MATT: It's up to you. The process of a giant,
armored gnome to change out her boots is gonna

00:15:56.800 --> 00:16:00.455
be-- it's not like a quick, it's not pressing the
'x' button in your inventory.

00:16:00.455 --> 00:16:03.028
LIAM: It's like changing from one pair of ski
boots into another pair of ski boots.

00:16:03.028 --> 00:16:04.618
MATT: Essentially, yeah.

00:16:04.618 --> 00:16:06.320
(laughter)

00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:07.598
MATT: So be mindful of that.

00:16:07.598 --> 00:16:11.410
LIAM: All right. Minor thing, I'm going to attune
the Deathwalker's Ward to necrotic.

00:16:11.597 --> 00:16:13.010
MATT: To necrotic. Okay.

00:16:13.010 --> 00:16:15.507
MARISHA: Well, then, how's your stealth, Percy?

00:16:15.507 --> 00:16:17.610
TALIESIN: I have spider-boots.

00:16:17.610 --> 00:16:20.429
MARISHA: Oh, you have spider-boots. What about
you, Grog?

00:16:20.429 --> 00:16:24.297
TRAVIS: Huh? What was the question? Sorry, I'm
drooling all over this--

00:16:24.297 --> 00:16:29.123
LAURA: Do you mind-- can I put 'em on for now?
Since I gave him back his boots. Is that okay?

00:16:29.123 --> 00:16:31.306
MARISHA: Yeah, my stealth is pretty all right.

00:16:31.306 --> 00:16:34.248
TALIESIN: He's got leaping boots.

00:16:34.248 --> 00:16:36.268
LIAM: Is that a Thor hammer, is that thing?

00:16:36.268 --> 00:16:40.432
TRAVIS: It's pretty fucking close. Apparently I
throw it, it comes right back to my hand. If I had

00:16:40.432 --> 00:16:44.794
Frenzied Rage and three attacks, would it go
(whack whack whack) like a giant yo-yo?

00:16:44.794 --> 00:16:46.161
MATT: Technically yes?

00:16:46.161 --> 00:16:48.498
TRAVIS: (hyperventilates) I'm taking this one.

00:16:48.498 --> 00:16:49.689
TALIESIN: I get it.

00:16:49.689 --> 00:16:52.062
LIAM: How far can you throw that thing?

00:16:52.062 --> 00:16:53.127
TRAVIS: 60 feet.

00:16:53.127 --> 00:16:57.678
MATT: Well, it's 20 feet and then 60 feet is the
second range increment, so if it's longer than 20

00:16:57.678 --> 00:16:59.685
feet, your attacks are at disadvantage.

00:16:59.685 --> 00:17:00.496
TRAVIS: Son of a bitch.

00:17:00.496 --> 00:17:01.689
MATT: But you can still attack.

00:17:01.689 --> 00:17:02.827
TRAVIS: What if I did Reckless Attack?

00:17:02.827 --> 00:17:05.509
MATT: Then it would be no more roll, and then
everyone gets advantage against you.

00:17:05.509 --> 00:17:08.192
TRAVIS: I love you right now. If these two tables
weren't in our way...

00:17:08.192 --> 00:17:11.676
MATT: Love the dice that rolled that treasure
hoard.

00:17:11.676 --> 00:17:16.307
LIAM: Ugh, what's all over the bottom of the table
after the show?

00:17:16.307 --> 00:17:17.621
TRAVIS: Mayonnaise.

00:17:17.621 --> 00:17:19.858
MATT: Is there anybody else that wanted to--

00:17:19.858 --> 00:17:22.052
TRAVIS: I would like to attune to this.

00:17:22.052 --> 00:17:23.486
MATT: To the Dwarven Thrower?

00:17:23.486 --> 00:17:24.860
TRAVIS: Yes. Not the Blood Axe.

00:17:24.860 --> 00:17:28.855
MATT: Okay, so the Blood Axe goes away. Dwarven
Thrower's out.

00:17:28.855 --> 00:17:31.559
TALIESIN: Cabal's, Dragonslayer, Animus.

00:17:31.559 --> 00:17:36.692
MATT: So, just so you're aware, the dice roll on
that is a d8 to do damage, as opposed to a d12.

00:17:36.692 --> 00:17:41.319
LAURA: Oh. That doesn't sound as cool.

00:17:41.319 --> 00:17:43.167
TRAVIS: I must think.

00:17:43.167 --> 00:17:48.485
MARISHA: I'm gonna do my circlet, my antlers, as
always, Ring of Protection, Spire of Conflux.

00:17:48.485 --> 00:17:49.677
MATT: Okay.

00:17:49.677 --> 00:17:56.110
PATRICK: Just to chime in, out of character, I
know we picked up the dancing sword, which could

00:17:56.110 --> 00:18:02.846
act as an autonomous fighting thing, but I don't
know who has that or who

00:18:02.846 --> 00:18:04.625
has slots available to attune.

00:18:04.625 --> 00:18:06.412
MATT: That is-- Grog has that, actually.

00:18:06.412 --> 00:18:08.932
LAURA: Grog has every weapon ever.

00:18:08.932 --> 00:18:10.649
MARISHA: Is it an attunement thing?

00:18:10.649 --> 00:18:12.155
MATT: You have to attune to it, yeah.

00:18:12.155 --> 00:18:14.255
LIAM: You're a Fallout character.

00:18:14.255 --> 00:18:19.843
MATT: But yes, Grog does have the sword.

00:18:19.843 --> 00:18:25.059
MARISHA: Do you have an extra spot, Kerr? To
attune?

00:18:25.059 --> 00:18:31.591
PATRICK: I'm gonna show my age, here. You know, I
have only occasionally done 5th edition, back in

00:18:31.591 --> 00:18:35.127
the day when I got used to playing, we never attuned our
weapons.

00:18:35.193 --> 00:18:38.928
MATT: Yeah, you only have two things attuned. You
do, you can.

00:18:38.928 --> 00:18:45.508
PATRICK: So I'm relatively easy in terms of what
magic items. I could have it and set it loose at

00:18:45.508 --> 00:18:47.727
the beginning of combat, if nobody else can.

00:18:47.727 --> 00:18:49.235
TRAVIS: Okay.

00:18:49.235 --> 00:18:55.899
MATT: So Grog pulls the sword out from the Bag of
Holding, and as he reaches and extends it towards

00:18:55.899 --> 00:19:01.342
you, you feel this sudden almost like a sudden
burst of headache at the back of your mind, and

00:19:01.342 --> 00:19:06.387
you stop for a second, Grog, and you look at the
blade. And there across the metallic sheen of this

00:19:06.387 --> 00:19:11.322
gorgeous scimitar, you see this image begin to
seep through and look at you. It's this

00:19:11.322 --> 00:19:13.967
female-like face, very faint, a reflection--

00:19:13.967 --> 00:19:15.288
TRAVIS: Female setting!

00:19:15.288 --> 00:19:20.103
MATT: But the teeth are fanged, and you see what
looks to be almost like a swirl of snakes around

00:19:20.103 --> 00:19:25.343
the outside. At that moment, you feel that burst
of headache in the back of your head grow

00:19:25.343 --> 00:19:29.692
extremely strong, and you drop the blade out of
your hand, and you guys watch as Grog falls to his

00:19:29.692 --> 00:19:35.768
knees, just clutching the sides of his head. The
sword, as it hits the ground, it clacks. The blade

00:19:35.768 --> 00:19:43.076
almost immediately rusts and turns into a dark,
dull metal. The gems crack and turn to dust, and

00:19:43.076 --> 00:19:46.573
what now lies there is an inert weapon.

00:19:46.573 --> 00:19:48.219
LAURA: What the fuck?

00:19:48.219 --> 00:19:49.895
LIAM: What did you do?

00:19:49.895 --> 00:19:51.571
MARISHA: Grog?

00:19:51.571 --> 00:19:53.946
TRAVIS: Ow.

00:19:53.946 --> 00:19:55.906
(laughter)

00:19:55.906 --> 00:19:58.581
LAURA: Oh no, did it turn you really, really,
really stupid?

00:19:58.581 --> 00:20:01.629
TRAVIS: That really hurt, and it's still hurting.

00:20:01.629 --> 00:20:03.852
MARISHA: Grog, how many fingers am I holding up?

00:20:03.852 --> 00:20:04.986
TRAVIS: Square.

00:20:04.986 --> 00:20:07.058
TALIESIN: Well, he's fine.

00:20:07.058 --> 00:20:12.001
LIAM: That magic sword bit me. That really hurt.

00:20:12.001 --> 00:20:15.545
TRAVIS: What happened?

00:20:15.545 --> 00:20:20.869
LAURA: Is it just because it's only meant for
you?

00:20:20.869 --> 00:20:22.442
LIAM: Kerrek, do you still want it?

00:20:22.442 --> 00:20:24.270
(laughter)

00:20:24.270 --> 00:20:31.508
PATRICK: Do I have any idea, like, was this thing
rejecting me or pissed

00:20:31.508 --> 00:20:34.873
that Grog was abandoning it?

00:20:34.873 --> 00:20:38.624
MATT: You get the sense, just 'cause you've seen a
few things like this, that this was actually an

00:20:38.624 --> 00:20:44.165
inherent curse within the blade, and it just took
a moment to dig itself into Grog.

00:20:44.165 --> 00:20:45.952
TRAVIS: Oh no.

00:20:45.952 --> 00:20:50.937
MATT: But the source of the curse is expended, and
Grog, you are permanently at -2 to all of your

00:20:50.937 --> 00:20:54.188
saving throws. Correcting my mistake from the card
last session.

00:20:54.188 --> 00:20:55.557
LAURA: Oh, shit!

00:20:55.557 --> 00:20:57.377
MARISHA: This is the Deck of Many Things?

00:20:57.377 --> 00:21:01.479
MATT: This was me completely either misreading or
mishearing it last time, as the internet let me

00:21:01.479 --> 00:21:04.935
know that was the card drawn, I want to make sure
that we stick to what was drawn.

00:21:04.935 --> 00:21:07.218
TRAVIS: I don't have a problem with that, I do
have a problem with the headache. Can we maybe

00:21:07.218 --> 00:21:09.473
bargain to get the headache removed? 'Cause I'm
really--

00:21:09.473 --> 00:21:11.936
TALIESIN: I have Tylenol, but it requires
attunement.

00:21:11.936 --> 00:21:14.787
(laughter)

00:21:14.787 --> 00:21:16.807
TRAVIS: I need BC Powder.

00:21:16.807 --> 00:21:18.753
MATT: I think Grog has a way to get rid of
headaches.

00:21:18.753 --> 00:21:22.400
LIAM: Can I also say, no one's gonna ever try to
get away with anything here, because we know we're

00:21:22.529 --> 00:21:28.051
being watched-- people are watching like hawks.
Everything's going to be seen.

00:21:28.051 --> 00:21:32.673
MARISHA: So -2 to all of his saving throws?

00:21:32.673 --> 00:21:33.740
MATT: Yes.

00:21:33.740 --> 00:21:34.736
MARISHA: Permanently?

00:21:34.736 --> 00:21:37.284
MATT: Well, until a god takes it away.

00:21:37.284 --> 00:21:44.942
LAURA: A god? No, go talk to the Raven Queen or
somebody. Sarenrae! (gasps) Maybe she can Greater

00:21:44.942 --> 00:21:48.315
Restoration, if Pike realizes what it is.

00:21:48.315 --> 00:21:53.217
TRAVIS: Stupid sword. Jeez, me and swords. Just
really not doing well.

00:21:53.217 --> 00:21:55.627
LIAM: Pike, can you take a look at your buddy?

00:21:55.627 --> 00:21:58.779
LAURA: Well, I don't know if I know that
anything's wrong with him.

00:21:58.779 --> 00:22:01.612
Grog, do you have a headache?

00:22:01.612 --> 00:22:08.428
MATT: Grog is clutching the side of his head. Pike
just came up to you and asked you a question.

00:22:08.428 --> 00:22:09.756
TRAVIS: What'd she say?

00:22:09.756 --> 00:22:10.862
LAURA: Do you have a headache?

00:22:10.862 --> 00:22:12.923
TRAVIS: I do. Do you have anything to help with
it?

00:22:12.923 --> 00:22:19.072
LAURA: Well, I can maybe do like a Cure Wounds,
or--

00:22:19.072 --> 00:22:23.580
TRAVIS: I'm not wounded, it's just a headache. Do
you have Cure Headache?

00:22:23.580 --> 00:22:28.968
LAURA: I don't think so, but I can pray to
Sarenrae if it would help?

00:22:28.968 --> 00:22:32.803
TRAVIS: I don't know, it's out of my league. I
mean, maybe, yeah.

00:22:32.803 --> 00:22:37.469
LAURA: Can I-- is there anything I have?

00:22:37.469 --> 00:22:39.461
MATT: What do you want to try?

00:22:39.461 --> 00:22:44.312
MARISHA: Pike is just universally cute. She's like
a kigurumi, if you wear it, you're just

00:22:44.312 --> 00:22:45.418
automatically cute.

00:22:45.418 --> 00:22:46.816
LAURA: Just insta-cute.

00:22:46.816 --> 00:22:48.003
MATT: It's true.

00:22:48.003 --> 00:22:54.777
LAURA: Would I know what to do? Would she know
what to do to try to help him at all?

00:22:54.777 --> 00:23:00.220
MATT: If it's a curse, I mean, there are a few
things that can usually take care of a regular

00:23:00.220 --> 00:23:03.273
curse, but she doesn't understand the nature of
this curse.

00:23:03.273 --> 00:23:10.772
LAURA: Okay. I can try to do a-- I don't know what
level Greater Restoration is.

00:23:10.772 --> 00:23:12.088
MATT: It's a 5th-level.

00:23:12.088 --> 00:23:14.330
TRAVIS: It's only a headache. I'll be fine.

00:23:14.330 --> 00:23:15.616
LAURA: Are you sure, Grog?

00:23:15.616 --> 00:23:17.573
TRAVIS: Yeah, we all just healed, I'm fine.

00:23:17.573 --> 00:23:21.292
LAURA: Okay. Let me know if you need anything,
though.

00:23:21.292 --> 00:23:23.270
TRAVIS: All right, yeah, I will. Thank you, Pike.

00:23:23.270 --> 00:23:27.483
PATRICK: Coming into this fight down two on all
saves...

00:23:27.483 --> 00:23:32.964
TRAVIS: We're gonna kick some ass. Oh, down two.
That's...

00:23:32.964 --> 00:23:37.218
TALIESIN: Do we have anything sitting around
that's not attuned, though--

00:23:37.218 --> 00:23:47.399
LIAM: Pike got that cloak that fucking Hotis glued
to my flesh off. That's I think what she did.

00:23:47.399 --> 00:23:55.508
MARISHA: Grog, if you want, also, you can have my
Ring of Protection, which is a Ring of Protection

00:23:55.508 --> 00:24:02.144
+2, and it gives you +2 to AC and to all your
saving throws. I was gonna wear it, but I could

00:24:02.144 --> 00:24:04.960
wear the Cloak of Displacement instead.

00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:07.818
TRAVIS: I'm not a real big jewelry fan. Do I have
to attune to it?

00:24:07.868 --> 00:24:08.892
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:24:08.892 --> 00:24:10.263
TRAVIS: Nah, I don't want it.

00:24:10.263 --> 00:24:11.588
MARISHA: Okay.

00:24:11.588 --> 00:24:17.326
TRAVIS: Thank you, though, Keyleth, that's very
sweet.

00:24:17.326 --> 00:24:25.629
MARISHA: You're welcome. It's a little bit of a
girly ring, so I understand. Well, you're full on

00:24:25.629 --> 00:24:27.858
attunements, right? You're full up?

00:24:27.858 --> 00:24:30.806
LAURA: Pike's gonna try to do Greater Restoration
on Grog.

00:24:30.806 --> 00:24:36.684
MATT: Okay. So as you guys are finishing this
conversation, Grog and Keyleth, Pike walks up and

00:24:36.684 --> 00:24:47.363
holds her gauntlet out, her giant, awesome,
monster-ogre gauntlet. As it begins to suddenly

00:24:47.363 --> 00:24:52.671
emit this bright white vibrant glow, she touches
the front of your forehead, beckoning you to bend

00:24:52.671 --> 00:24:57.045
down to try and get rid of the headache. You watch
as the healing energy surges through your body

00:24:57.045 --> 00:25:02.588
from head to toe, and as it passes through you,
the light fades, the spell is spent-- that's a

00:25:02.588 --> 00:25:05.674
5th-level spell she used-- and the headache
remains.

00:25:05.674 --> 00:25:07.254
(groaning)

00:25:07.254 --> 00:25:09.188
TRAVIS: Did it do anything for my gas?

00:25:09.188 --> 00:25:13.628
MATT: There is no divine magic that can do
anything about that either, Grog.

00:25:13.628 --> 00:25:14.627
TRAVIS: Son of a bitch.

00:25:14.627 --> 00:25:21.053
LAURA: It was worth a try, though, because that
would've been helpful.

00:25:21.053 --> 00:25:28.803
TALIESIN: I cannot find my card for my Ring of
Lightning Resistance. It seems to have vanished.

00:25:28.803 --> 00:25:32.045
TRAVIS: I don't know where it would have gone.

00:25:32.045 --> 00:25:34.748
TALIESIN: Do we have anything else equipped that
we can--

00:25:34.748 --> 00:25:40.272
LAURA: I didn't say it the last time, but
Trinket's out of the necklace, and he healed

00:25:40.272 --> 00:25:42.743
overnight, 'cause he's low too.

00:25:42.743 --> 00:25:50.603
PATRICK: Actually, you know, Kerrek is kind of
standing around, buffing a little bit of the rust

00:25:50.603 --> 00:26:04.852
out of his off-the-rack chainmail. He's trying not
to look like that kid who showed up at the rich

00:26:04.852 --> 00:26:06.176
kids' party.

00:26:06.176 --> 00:26:08.880
(laughter)

00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:16.983
PATRICK: Out of character, I will say, if anyone
has anything that they're not using in terms of--

00:26:16.983 --> 00:26:18.337
TRAVIS: Yeah, no, we do!

00:26:18.337 --> 00:26:20.933
PATRICK: I'm reasonably geared up, I'll be able to
go in and hit.

00:26:20.933 --> 00:26:26.705
TALIESIN: Are you wearing armor?

00:26:26.705 --> 00:26:28.749
MATT: He has chainmail.

00:26:28.749 --> 00:26:31.017
TALIESIN: Okay, so the Bracers of Defense wouldn't
work.

00:26:31.017 --> 00:26:35.053
MARISHA: Yeah, would the cloak work with armor,
right? It wouldn't replace his armor, a cloak?

00:26:35.053 --> 00:26:36.736
MATT: No, the cloak can go over armor.

00:26:36.736 --> 00:26:42.601
MARISHA: Are you okay with that, Vax? Kerr, we
have this Cloak of Displacement that's pretty

00:26:42.601 --> 00:26:45.523
awesome, if you want to wear it.

00:26:45.523 --> 00:26:48.894
LIAM: Yeah, it's made from the flesh of a flying
manta ray-type thing, and it makes you really hard

00:26:48.894 --> 00:26:51.340
to hit, and this is a loaner--

00:26:51.340 --> 00:26:53.327
MATT: It's actually made from the flesh of a
displacer beast.

00:26:53.327 --> 00:27:01.099
LIAM: I know that, I know. I also have a very
precious ring which I would love to have back from

00:27:01.099 --> 00:27:05.260
you once we've killed this dragon, but you will
not be seen if you wear it.

00:27:05.260 --> 00:27:10.963
PATRICK: I would put that to good use in the
coming fight.

00:27:10.963 --> 00:27:15.751
MARISHA: Okay. I take the cloak and I throw it
over him. You gonna tweet it to him? Or text it to

00:27:15.751 --> 00:27:17.221
him? Whatever.

00:27:17.221 --> 00:27:21.422
LIAM: And I slap the ring down into his palm.

00:27:21.422 --> 00:27:23.328
MARISHA: Do you have a picture of the ring?

00:27:23.328 --> 00:27:24.774
LIAM: A picture of the ring?

00:27:24.774 --> 00:27:26.486
LAURA: It's a Ring of Invisibility?

00:27:26.486 --> 00:27:28.403
MARISHA: Do you have a thing? No?

00:27:28.403 --> 00:27:30.006
LIAM: Yes, I have a thing.

00:27:30.006 --> 00:27:32.092
LAURA: Just a legendary ring.

00:27:32.092 --> 00:27:47.637
MATT: Just a legendary ring like you do. Just
note, with the Ring of Invisibility, you remain

00:27:47.637 --> 00:27:52.238
invisible until the ring is removed, until you
attack or cast a spell, or until you use a bonus

00:27:52.238 --> 00:27:54.021
action to become visible again.

00:27:54.021 --> 00:27:56.726
LIAM: If anyone has anything better to give him,
we could do that.

00:27:56.726 --> 00:27:59.468
LAURA: No, that's really good. That's a badass
ring.

00:27:59.468 --> 00:28:07.667
LIAM: Hey, Siri, remind me to ask Patrick Rothfuss
for my Ring of Invisibility back once the dragon

00:28:07.667 --> 00:28:12.315
is dead. We're good.

00:28:12.315 --> 00:28:14.679
MATT: All right, there you go. Thank you, Siri.

00:28:14.679 --> 00:28:17.830
(laughter)

00:28:17.910 --> 00:28:20.083
TRAVIS: Assisting D&amp;D games since 2000-something.

00:28:20.083 --> 00:28:22.813
MATT: All right. So. What else do you guys want to
prepare, if anything, as you wake up, come to

00:28:22.813 --> 00:28:23.942
consciousness--

00:28:23.942 --> 00:28:25.751
LAURA: We should have a Heroes' Feast.

00:28:25.751 --> 00:28:27.420
MARISHA: Yes, we should.

00:28:27.420 --> 00:28:29.803
LAURA: Is there anybody that could do a Heroes'
Feast?

00:28:29.803 --> 00:28:31.690
MARISHA: Pike, how are you looking on Feasts?

00:28:31.690 --> 00:28:36.865
MATT: I mean, if Pike wants to prepare a Heroes'
Feast, Pike can cast it.

00:28:36.865 --> 00:28:39.943
MARISHA: Can Gilmore?

00:28:39.943 --> 00:28:41.735
LIAM: That was a one-time thing.

00:28:41.735 --> 00:28:46.650
MATT: Gilmore had a few items that basically
turned into a Heroes' Feast,

00:28:46.650 --> 00:28:47.807
but he lost his shop.

00:28:47.807 --> 00:28:55.455
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay. Pike can do another--
what level is that?

00:28:55.455 --> 00:29:02.124
MATT: Heroes' Feast. It is, I believe, 6th-level,
I think. Yes, 6th-level.

00:29:02.124 --> 00:29:07.258
TRAVIS: Why're we having a Feast? Are we going to
fight something?

00:29:07.258 --> 00:29:10.596
TALIESIN: It's breakfast. It's the most important
meal of the day.

00:29:10.596 --> 00:29:13.299
TRAVIS: That's right. I feel terrible for not
realizing that.

00:29:13.299 --> 00:29:16.345
LAURA: Okay, so we all have Heroes' Feast.

00:29:16.415 --> 00:29:24.849
MATT: All right, so. Mark your diamond that you
recently found in the hoard, marked off, as Pike

00:29:24.849 --> 00:29:29.764
prepares a long wooden table, summoned through
divine magic, that contains a fantastic meal of

00:29:29.764 --> 00:29:36.633
all the classic Westruun comfort foods, instilled
with the power and guidance of Sarenrae. As you

00:29:36.633 --> 00:29:44.207
spend the additional hour to eat and drink and
gain the effect of the spell, you become immune to

00:29:44.207 --> 00:29:49.558
poison, immune to fear, and you all get an
additional 2d10 to your maximum hit points, if you

00:29:49.558 --> 00:29:51.343
want to roll that, Laura.

00:29:51.343 --> 00:29:52.627
LAURA: For Pike?

00:29:52.627 --> 00:29:56.842
MATT: Yes. Well, this is for everybody. Everybody
gets this amount.

00:29:56.842 --> 00:30:01.513
LAURA: Oh, that's not bad, that's not bad. That's
a 15 added for everybody.

00:30:01.513 --> 00:30:03.822
MATT: So everybody gets 15 additional hit points.

00:30:03.822 --> 00:30:12.553
MARISHA: And I'm assuming Trinket is eating and
Allura is eating?

00:30:12.553 --> 00:30:21.365
MATT: It can feed up to 12 people, so yes. That
would be Kerr as well, and Allura, and Kima.

00:30:21.365 --> 00:30:25.650
TALIESIN: We get advantage on what saves?

00:30:25.650 --> 00:30:28.780
LAURA: Fear and poison.

00:30:28.780 --> 00:30:31.141
MATT: Well, you're immune to fear and immune to
poison.

00:30:31.141 --> 00:30:32.713
TALIESIN: We don't get advantage?

00:30:32.713 --> 00:30:34.139
LAURA: Advantage on wisdom.

00:30:34.139 --> 00:30:38.388
MATT: Wisdom saving throws. All righty.

00:30:38.388 --> 00:30:47.153
LAURA: And I attuned-- by the way, my Bracers of
Archery are attuned again.

00:30:47.153 --> 00:30:51.774
MATT: You reattuned to your Bracers of Archery?
Cool. All righty. So.

00:30:51.774 --> 00:30:54.372
MARISHA: Should I do a Scrying Eye, see if I can
still find Raishan?

00:30:54.372 --> 00:30:58.934
LAURA: Yeah, but what should you scry on? Can you
scry on Thordak's body or something? 'Cause she

00:30:58.934 --> 00:31:00.581
would have it right next to her.

00:31:00.581 --> 00:31:01.760
MARISHA: Can I?

00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:02.871
TALIESIN: We have the ball.

00:31:02.871 --> 00:31:04.582
MATT: It's either a creature or location.

00:31:04.582 --> 00:31:12.490
PATRICK: Well, if right now we're pretty sure that
they don't know we know where they are, do we want

00:31:12.490 --> 00:31:15.267
to risk that? Losing the surprise?

00:31:15.267 --> 00:31:24.654
MARISHA: We don't. If I scry on her cave, would
that tip her off? The cave of Opash?

00:31:24.654 --> 00:31:26.830
MATT: Only one way to find out.

00:31:26.830 --> 00:31:29.017
MARISHA: Only one way to find out?

00:31:29.017 --> 00:31:35.708
TALIESIN: I'm of the opinion that-- personally, I
think it's safer to know what we know now and go

00:31:35.708 --> 00:31:37.165
in, because if things--

00:31:37.165 --> 00:31:44.174
MARISHA: I mean, I can always teleport us there
and scry there. That way, at least-- minutes.

00:31:44.174 --> 00:31:49.022
MATT: As far as you know, when you create a sensor
at a location, creatures that can see invisibility

00:31:49.022 --> 00:31:54.996
can see the actual scrying location, the orb
itself that you create, the magical orb of which

00:31:54.996 --> 00:32:01.378
your vision appears through. But that's the only
thing you would have to consider.

00:32:01.378 --> 00:32:05.638
MARISHA: That's a massive thing to consider.

00:32:05.638 --> 00:32:11.070
TRAVIS: Unless she's in, like, perma-bubble-bath
world or something.

00:32:11.070 --> 00:32:12.304
LIAM: We should just go.

00:32:12.304 --> 00:32:13.710
MARISHA: I think we should, too.

00:32:13.710 --> 00:32:17.383
LAURA: Oh, jeez! I'm so nervous.

00:32:17.383 --> 00:32:18.558
MARISHA: I know.

00:32:18.558 --> 00:32:19.896
TRAVIS: I'm not.

00:32:19.896 --> 00:32:21.735
TALIESIN: I'm feeling strangely positive.

00:32:21.735 --> 00:32:23.196
TRAVIS: -2, playas.

00:32:23.196 --> 00:32:25.337
LIAM: Would you put that piece of wood down,
please?

00:32:25.337 --> 00:32:27.017
LAURA: He's eating wood again.

00:32:27.017 --> 00:32:29.644
MARISHA: We need to get him another salt lick.

00:32:29.644 --> 00:32:34.637
TRAVIS: I do miss my salt lick rock. Can I keep an
eye out as we walk

00:32:34.637 --> 00:32:36.398
around for another salt lick rock?

00:32:36.398 --> 00:32:38.165
MATT: Make a perception check.

00:32:38.165 --> 00:32:43.229
TRAVIS: Don't make me do that. Ooh!

00:32:43.229 --> 00:32:45.327
TALIESIN: God, the sound those things make.

00:32:45.327 --> 00:32:46.520
TRAVIS: 13.

00:32:46.520 --> 00:32:49.465
TALIESIN: It's like your dice have a subwoofer.

00:32:49.465 --> 00:32:56.090
MATT: You find a few separate pieces of what look
like quartz-like rock that line the sides of the

00:32:56.090 --> 00:33:01.620
road and the exterior garden of the castle, and
upon trying each one, not as salty as you'd hoped.

00:33:01.620 --> 00:33:05.109
They're generally just bits of whitestone or
rock.

00:33:05.109 --> 00:33:07.894
MARISHA: Grog, that's caca!

00:33:07.894 --> 00:33:09.262
TRAVIS: Find your own!

00:33:09.262 --> 00:33:12.511
TALIESIN: Let him lick it if he wants it. It's
just gonna make him happy.

00:33:12.511 --> 00:33:15.949
TRAVIS: Is it close to salty? Could I confuse it
with salt?

00:33:15.949 --> 00:33:19.382
MATT: I mean, you get a hint of salt, but it's
gone after the first lick.

00:33:19.386 --> 00:33:21.701
TRAVIS: More shiny than the others?

00:33:21.701 --> 00:33:24.314
MATT: After licking it a few times, it gets a
little shinier, yeah.

00:33:24.314 --> 00:33:27.332
TRAVIS: I am a great sorcerer. I will keep this
new stone.

00:33:27.332 --> 00:33:30.299
MATT: Okay. So go ahead and mark three quartz
rocks.

00:33:30.299 --> 00:33:31.552
TRAVIS: Palm-sized?

00:33:31.552 --> 00:33:34.986
MATT: Roughly. Some are a little bigger. The
center one is a little bit

00:33:34.986 --> 00:33:36.575
like a basketball size.

00:33:36.575 --> 00:33:38.916
TRAVIS: Bag of Holding, you've got new occupants.

00:33:38.916 --> 00:33:44.628
MARISHA: Putting rocks in the Bag of Holding. Just
filling it with rocks.

00:33:44.628 --> 00:33:46.426
LAURA: Rocks and like dried poo.

00:33:46.426 --> 00:33:48.478
MATT: Don't judge his collection.

00:33:48.478 --> 00:33:58.377
MARISHA: Ox, oxen, troll dicks, pet rocks, just a
bunch of pet rocks.

00:33:58.377 --> 00:34:06.430
MATT: All right. As you guys are preparing, Kima
and Allura catch up to you guys. They've gathered

00:34:06.430 --> 00:34:09.130
their materials and they're prepped for battle.
Kima's fully armored.

00:34:09.130 --> 00:34:12.702
MARISHA: Does she look badass? In her full
sorceress armor?

00:34:12.702 --> 00:34:14.032
MATT: Oh, Allura?

00:34:14.032 --> 00:34:16.707
MARISHA: Paint a picture. What's she look like?

00:34:16.707 --> 00:34:18.379
(laughter)

00:34:18.379 --> 00:34:22.168
MARISHA: She's an upper-middle-class girl.

00:34:22.168 --> 00:34:29.541
MATT: She's wearing one of her many ceremonial
robes that she does for presentory Tal'Dorei

00:34:29.541 --> 00:34:37.184
Council work, but you see she has a hood up over
her head, her hair braids are tied together behind

00:34:37.184 --> 00:34:41.734
her neck so they don't get in the way. You notice
that there is some really nice jewelry that's

00:34:41.734 --> 00:34:46.255
adorning the side of her neck. The staff she
carries with her usually is relatively simple, but

00:34:46.255 --> 00:34:52.271
you see now that there are a number of runes
carved in a spiral along the sides of it. You can

00:34:52.271 --> 00:34:58.145
see a number of rings that she previously wasn't
wearing that are on, and her face is hardened, and

00:34:58.145 --> 00:35:05.295
you see that she-- where normally she has this air
of keeping the room-- almost a teacher or

00:35:05.295 --> 00:35:11.358
parental-type presence in the area, there's an
intensity and darkness to her face that you

00:35:11.358 --> 00:35:15.229
haven't really seen before. Not since at least the
attack on the city happened.

00:35:15.229 --> 00:35:16.708
LIAM: Work!

00:35:16.708 --> 00:35:20.229
LAURA: (sings) Allura!

00:35:20.229 --> 00:35:22.285
MATT: (sings) And Kima.

00:35:22.285 --> 00:35:25.390
TRAVIS: Oh my god!

00:35:25.390 --> 00:35:35.956
MATT: All right, guys. So. They've arrived, and
Allura steps into the room, her staff clicking

00:35:35.956 --> 00:35:41.282
across the stone floor of the castle. "All right.
Have we put all of our affairs in order?"

00:35:41.282 --> 00:35:43.612
TRAVIS: Yes.

00:35:43.612 --> 00:35:45.538
TALIESIN: Well, I hate when you put it that way.

00:35:45.538 --> 00:35:47.654
LAURA: Kima got the Feast, too, right?

00:35:47.654 --> 00:35:51.613
MATT: They come in towards the beginning of the
casting of the Feast, and they eat as well, yes.

00:35:51.613 --> 00:35:54.691
TALIESIN: It's a buffet. It's a Heroes' Buffet.

00:35:54.691 --> 00:36:07.422
MATT: "So. How best should we arrive? If you have
the ability to bring us through the tree, or I can

00:36:07.422 --> 00:36:09.231
"teleport us there."

00:36:09.231 --> 00:36:13.646
LAURA: Is it the same difference?

00:36:13.646 --> 00:36:19.331
MARISHA: What power-- how much energy do you use
when you teleport?

00:36:19.331 --> 00:36:26.872
MATT: "As far as the advancement of spell
strength, a Teleport spell in its own right is the

00:36:26.872 --> 00:36:29.486
"seventh sphere of magical incantation."

00:36:29.486 --> 00:36:36.482
MARISHA: Mm. Then let me go with our Transport Via
Plants, which is more of a six, you know, level.

00:36:36.482 --> 00:36:38.729
MATT: "Sounds like a wondrous idea."

00:36:38.729 --> 00:36:45.141
TALIESIN: Worst-case scenario, we can camp for the
night, if are victorious and spent.

00:36:45.141 --> 00:36:47.587
TRAVIS: I love camping.

00:36:47.587 --> 00:36:50.544
MARISHA: Yeah, it looks like a very pretty
island.

00:36:50.544 --> 00:36:54.906
TALIESIN: Let's make sure that one of the Gate
Stones is left here in case one of us has to make

00:36:54.906 --> 00:36:56.078
a mad dash.

00:36:56.078 --> 00:36:57.537
MARISHA: Give it to Cassandra?

00:36:57.537 --> 00:37:03.417
TALIESIN: Give it, obviously, keep it in
Cassandra's care. If somebody comes back, you know

00:37:03.417 --> 00:37:05.419
everything's gone horribly wrong.

00:37:05.419 --> 00:37:09.121
MATT: Kima rushes over and takes the stone from
your hand and goes, "All right, I'll give it to

00:37:09.121 --> 00:37:14.033
"her. Be right back." She jogs off. You hear the
(clanging) of the armor as she disappears

00:37:14.033 --> 00:37:14.995
TALIESIN: Maybe we should give--

00:37:14.995 --> 00:37:16.659
TALIESIN and MARISHA: -- her the boots.

00:37:16.659 --> 00:37:18.410
MARISHA: That's not a bad call.

00:37:18.410 --> 00:37:20.648
LAURA: That's true.

00:37:20.648 --> 00:37:24.132
MATT: So.

00:37:24.132 --> 00:37:30.026
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, you know what? When Kima comes
back, I'm gonna give her the Elven boots, so she

00:37:30.026 --> 00:37:31.661
can be quiet.

00:37:31.661 --> 00:37:35.407
MATT: She takes them and is like, "Not really my
style."

00:37:35.407 --> 00:37:37.343
LAURA: If you don't want them, I'll wear them, I
mean, I like them a lot.

00:37:37.343 --> 00:37:40.147
I'm just saying, you're loud.

00:37:40.147 --> 00:37:47.656
MATT: "I'll take 'em." And you all wait patiently
for the next six minutes as she unbuckles and

00:37:47.656 --> 00:37:52.423
pulls off the rest of her lower armor and gets the
boots on.

00:37:52.423 --> 00:37:54.649
TRAVIS: That don't match at all.

00:37:54.649 --> 00:37:57.291
MATT: No. And you can see it gives her a twinge of
disappointment.

00:37:57.291 --> 00:38:02.550
MARISHA: It's like different tiered armors in
Warcraft. It's the worst.

00:38:02.550 --> 00:38:07.019
LIAM: Slips her Doc Martens over here.

00:38:07.019 --> 00:38:11.285
MATT: The expansion just came out, so it's like
all epics and one green that's better than the

00:38:11.285 --> 00:38:22.347
rest. Yeah. That's the worst. (laughs) All right.
With you all gathered there, Allura, hood still

00:38:22.347 --> 00:38:25.770
up, kind of nods. "Keyleth, lead the way. To the
Sun Tree, then?"

00:38:25.770 --> 00:38:27.025
MARISHA: To the Sun Tree.

00:38:27.025 --> 00:38:34.858
MATT: "Very well. (sighs) Let us hope that we
return here tomorrow victorious." She swirls

00:38:34.858 --> 00:38:39.137
around, her cloak spinning around her base as she
follows suit after you, Keyleth, the rest of you

00:38:39.137 --> 00:38:44.835
make your way, marching down the front of Castle
Whitestone to the center of the town, where there

00:38:44.835 --> 00:38:53.705
you see the faint elements of green bloom now
growing across the tree from where once it was

00:38:53.705 --> 00:39:01.712
bare, the season bringing a sense of spring and
summer that have been kept at bay for a while. And

00:39:01.712 --> 00:39:07.766
for you as well, Percival, this is the first time
in a long time you've seen the Sun Tree showing

00:39:07.766 --> 00:39:09.291
that growing life.

00:39:09.291 --> 00:39:11.496
TALIESIN: I quietly sneak up and give it a good
kiss.

00:39:11.496 --> 00:39:18.890
MARISHA: Aw. I see it, and I'm like. You know, I
know him. I can put in a good word.

00:39:18.890 --> 00:39:22.122
TALIESIN: Really? We talk all the time, he never
mentions you.

00:39:22.122 --> 00:39:29.743
MARISHA: What? What? I'm gonna let that go.

00:39:29.743 --> 00:39:32.233
(laughter)

00:39:32.233 --> 00:39:36.272
MARISHA: That could be a discussion. I don't wanna
do that right now. We'll talk later.

00:39:36.272 --> 00:39:38.594
Are we ready?

00:39:38.594 --> 00:39:43.674
MATT: All right, so what are you focusing on for
the receiving end of this?

00:39:43.674 --> 00:39:49.070
MARISHA: I'm assuming I found a tree that was
close to her cavern that's big enough?

00:39:49.070 --> 00:39:53.895
MATT: With the second scrying that you did with
Allura, which was just specifically the Island of

00:39:53.895 --> 00:40:02.898
Viscan, you did see a number of trees not far from
the rocky protrusion, the small mountain that

00:40:02.898 --> 00:40:11.576
seemed to be the place where this laboratory's in.
So yes, you can choose one of those trees you saw

00:40:11.576 --> 00:40:13.127
that would be large enough to do it.

00:40:13.127 --> 00:40:14.293
MARISHA: Okay.

00:40:14.293 --> 00:40:22.367
TALIESIN: Scanlan stops us before we start. For
the record, this is a terrible idea and we have no

00:40:22.367 --> 00:40:30.139
plan. Just putting it out there. I'm with you,
this is a terrible plan, and we're going to die.

00:40:30.139 --> 00:40:31.636
LAURA: You seem different.

00:40:31.636 --> 00:40:38.833
TALIESIN: I'm fine. I have a cold. I don't feel
well. I'm taking something for it.

00:40:38.833 --> 00:40:41.031
TRAVIS: Sing me a song. Sing me a song right now.

00:40:41.031 --> 00:40:42.136
TALIESIN: I'm not singing.

00:40:42.136 --> 00:40:47.044
MARISHA: I try to stealthily sniff Scanlan. Does
he smell like--

00:40:47.044 --> 00:40:49.027
MATT: (laughing) Well, first roll a stealth
check.

00:40:49.027 --> 00:40:50.815
(laughter)

00:40:50.815 --> 00:40:52.752
TRAVIS: Don't ever say the word.

00:40:52.752 --> 00:40:55.071
MARISHA: Okay. 14.

00:40:55.071 --> 00:41:01.718
MATT: 14. The not-stealthy-at-all Keyleth slowly
approaches you. You see her. You make eye contact.

00:41:01.718 --> 00:41:06.098
And yet she still slowly crawls up and begins
taking a big whiff on your shoulder.

00:41:06.098 --> 00:41:10.167
MARISHA: (sniffs) Ah, so nervous.

00:41:10.167 --> 00:41:18.587
TALIESIN: There once was a barbarian named Grog,
who had the IQ of a log-- I'd keep going, but now

00:41:18.587 --> 00:41:20.744
you're excited, and you've made me lose my--

00:41:20.744 --> 00:41:23.417
TRAVIS: That was amazing.

00:41:23.417 --> 00:41:26.436
MARISHA: Does he smell like the incense that I
smelled from him before?

00:41:26.436 --> 00:41:31.525
MATT: No. He smells of frustration,
disappointment, and worry.

00:41:31.525 --> 00:41:34.732
MARISHA: You smell like a sad man. All right,
let's go.

00:41:34.732 --> 00:41:39.138
MATT: (laughs) All right. So do you go ahead and
cast the spell? All right.

00:41:39.138 --> 00:41:45.447
MARISHA: I say to the Sun Tree, I say, I like your
new haircut. I have a new one too.

00:41:45.447 --> 00:41:46.756
Okay, let's go.

00:41:46.756 --> 00:41:49.281
LAURA: I cast Pass Without a Trace on all of us
before we go through the tree.

00:41:49.281 --> 00:41:56.187
MATT: Okay. So as the shadows coalesce around your
bodies, your legs, your knees, your feet, you

00:41:56.187 --> 00:42:02.224
watch as the front of the Sun Tree suddenly splits
open to reveal the pathway through across to what

00:42:02.224 --> 00:42:08.751
looks to be a partially ruined jungle. You all
step through the tree quickly before the portal

00:42:08.751 --> 00:42:13.537
slams shut behind you, and as you guys emerge,
looking about, you can see what looks to be a lot

00:42:13.537 --> 00:42:24.021
of heavy dirt and earth that-- there's spatterings
of sand throughout, and surrounding it

00:42:24.021 --> 00:42:29.484
immediately, you can see there are different trees
throughout this kind of-- some points are lush

00:42:29.484 --> 00:42:34.093
green jungle on the outside, and the further in
you go, you watch as the trees have all withered

00:42:34.093 --> 00:42:41.371
black. A little ways over the treeline, you can
see maybe a quarter-mile off what looks to be the

00:42:41.371 --> 00:42:48.237
top of the mountain that a brief instant of your
first vision in your Scry spell lent you towards.

00:42:48.237 --> 00:42:58.253
MARISHA: Does it look like the blight of the trees
is getting more concentrated the closer to the top

00:42:58.253 --> 00:42:59.360
of the mountain?

00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:02.722
MATT: It looks like it's a radial effect from the
actual mountain, yes.

00:43:02.722 --> 00:43:05.055
TRAVIS: Does it look like fire damage or something
else?

00:43:05.055 --> 00:43:07.740
MATT: You want to go ahead and take a look? Make an
investigation check.

00:43:07.740 --> 00:43:13.136
TRAVIS: Yeah! Stand back. 11 minus two.

00:43:13.183 --> 00:43:27.031
MATT: (laughs) You can't recall the color, really,
that they've become, but it's not alive.

00:43:27.031 --> 00:43:32.894
TRAVIS: Someone peed on these trees. All of 'em.
In a big circle. Like that.

00:43:32.894 --> 00:43:37.103
MARISHA: Grog, is this what happens when you pee
on trees?

00:43:37.103 --> 00:43:38.701
TRAVIS: Is that not normal?

00:43:38.701 --> 00:43:44.058
MARISHA: We should talk with Pike when we get
home. Make sure you're okay.

00:43:44.058 --> 00:43:48.932
LAURA: Oh, do you need me to cast another Greater
Restoration? For your--

00:43:48.932 --> 00:43:51.600
MARISHA: No, his bladder infection's fine.

00:43:51.600 --> 00:43:52.595
LAURA: Okay.

00:43:52.595 --> 00:43:54.048
TALIESIN: It can keep.

00:43:54.048 --> 00:43:58.234
MATT: It takes a Wish spell to get rid of that,
unfortunately.

00:43:58.234 --> 00:44:00.735
LIAM: He's been in every brothel in Tal'Dorei,
it's to be expected.

00:44:00.735 --> 00:44:02.677
(laughter)

00:44:02.677 --> 00:44:03.937
TRAVIS: Not ashamed.

00:44:03.937 --> 00:44:07.938
LAURA: He and Scanlan both.

00:44:07.938 --> 00:44:11.037
MARISHA: Did he find anything out? Did you find
anything out?

00:44:11.037 --> 00:44:12.466
MATT: No, he didn't find anything.

00:44:12.466 --> 00:44:13.506
MARISHA: Can I do a nature check?

00:44:13.506 --> 00:44:14.699
MATT: Sure, go for it.

00:44:14.699 --> 00:44:17.329
TRAVIS: These trees aren't alive.

00:44:17.329 --> 00:44:20.446
MARISHA: Fancy that. That's good. 21.

00:44:20.446 --> 00:44:25.591
MATT: Okay. As you guys begin to walk through--
it's not a very dense jungle.

00:44:25.591 --> 00:44:27.726
LAURA: We want to keep quiet as we do it.

00:44:27.726 --> 00:44:29.184
MATT: Okay, so make stealth checks as well.

00:44:29.184 --> 00:44:31.357
MARISHA: We have Pass Without a Trace?

00:44:31.357 --> 00:44:33.305
MATT: Yes you do, so plus ten to all your
stealth.

00:44:33.305 --> 00:44:34.635
MARISHA: Natural 20!

00:44:34.635 --> 00:44:36.517
MARISHA and LAURA: Pew-pew-pew!

00:44:36.517 --> 00:44:39.537
MARISHA: If only it mattered right now.
Pew-pew-pew.

00:44:39.537 --> 00:44:50.468
MATT: All righty. And a natural 20 for Allura.
And, actually-- I rolled with disadvantage for

00:44:50.468 --> 00:44:54.437
Kima, and it was like a 16 and a four, but then
she had the boots on, so the first one sticks.

00:44:54.437 --> 00:44:56.267
LAURA: 24 for Pike!

00:44:56.267 --> 00:45:00.397
MATT: Nice. So, stealthily, you guys-- what did
you roll?

00:45:00.397 --> 00:45:05.313
TALIESIN: I rolled 33 and Scanlan rolled 31.

00:45:05.313 --> 00:45:06.767
MATT: Grog?

00:45:06.767 --> 00:45:08.211
TRAVIS: 13.

00:45:08.211 --> 00:45:09.281
TALIESIN: Plus ten.

00:45:09.281 --> 00:45:10.274
TRAVIS: Yep.

00:45:10.274 --> 00:45:11.187
TALIESIN: Okay.

00:45:11.187 --> 00:45:12.302
MATT: With the plus ten?

00:45:12.302 --> 00:45:13.245
TRAVIS: Yep.

00:45:13.245 --> 00:45:14.449
TALIESIN: How did you do that?

00:45:14.449 --> 00:45:16.594
MATT: Okay, well, Kerr, what did you get?

00:45:16.594 --> 00:45:18.288
PATRICK: 14 for me.

00:45:18.288 --> 00:45:19.655
LAURA: Plus ten?

00:45:19.655 --> 00:45:23.598
PATRICK: Where did that plus ten come from?

00:45:23.598 --> 00:45:25.121
LAURA: From Pass Without a Trace!

00:45:25.121 --> 00:45:27.363
MATT: A spell that she had cast on all of you.

00:45:27.363 --> 00:45:29.251
PATRICK: Then I am at 24.

00:45:29.251 --> 00:45:30.866
(cheering)

00:45:30.866 --> 00:45:32.861
LAURA: 38.

00:45:32.861 --> 00:45:34.822
MARISHA: 37!

00:45:34.822 --> 00:45:39.669
MATT: As you guys fan out in this--

00:45:39.669 --> 00:45:41.700
(computer chime)

00:45:41.700 --> 00:45:43.475
TALIESIN: Now boarding: Star Tours.

00:45:43.475 --> 00:45:46.376
MARISHA: Thanks for that, Microsoft Outlook.

00:45:46.376 --> 00:45:51.615
MATT: As you begin to weave your way through these
trees as quietly as you possibly can, Keyleth, you

00:45:51.615 --> 00:45:59.222
step behind and run your fingers along some of
these withered grey and black fronds and branches.

00:45:59.222 --> 00:46:09.537
All these trees look like they had the life force
pulled from them, almost like a very, very rapid

00:46:09.537 --> 00:46:14.690
starvation, or thirst took them, but what's
interesting is a lot of these trees are

00:46:14.690 --> 00:46:18.535
near-petrified and have been this way for a very
long time.

00:46:18.535 --> 00:46:19.875
MARISHA: That was gonna be my question.

00:46:19.875 --> 00:46:21.304
MATT: It's not a recent occurrence.

00:46:21.304 --> 00:46:23.492
MARISHA: So like the petrified forest in Arizona?

00:46:23.492 --> 00:46:27.951
MATT: Kind of, yeah. But a sadder version, if
that's possible. They're all like

00:46:27.951 --> 00:46:31.028
"ehh, I'm a bad tree."

00:46:31.028 --> 00:46:37.752
TALIESIN: What do I know about Opash and the
crimes and what sort of tinkering?

00:46:37.752 --> 00:46:41.590
MATT: You don't know that much. The fact that you
knew the name and a little bit of the history was

00:46:41.590 --> 00:46:50.239
even impressive by the standards of everyone here.
What little you do know is that he was sent away

00:46:50.239 --> 00:46:58.080
specifically because of his inquiries into how far
you can reach with necromantic magics, and lost

00:46:58.080 --> 00:47:00.442
history from the Age of Arcanum.

00:47:00.442 --> 00:47:02.157
TALIESIN: Okay, that's good to know.

00:47:02.157 --> 00:47:09.230
MATT: The Age of Arcanum was the epoch before the
Divergence, before the Calamity hit, and not a lot

00:47:09.230 --> 00:47:12.844
of history exists about it, a lot of it was
destroyed either during the battle, or people

00:47:12.844 --> 00:47:20.244
destroyed it thereafter to prevent us from reusing
what led to that sort of conflict. But Opash

00:47:20.244 --> 00:47:23.514
apparently had gathered, or at least was in the
process of trying to recover, some of that

00:47:23.593 --> 00:47:24.713
information.

00:47:24.713 --> 00:47:29.509
MARISHA: So these trees have been dead for
hundreds of years.

00:47:29.509 --> 00:47:31.192
MATT: Hundreds of years, yes.

00:47:31.192 --> 00:47:32.519
MARISHA: All right.

00:47:32.519 --> 00:47:33.948
TALIESIN: So the scarring does not seem recent.

00:47:34.024 --> 00:47:36.083
MARISHA: And there's no new scarring.

00:47:36.083 --> 00:47:40.186
MATT: There does not appear to be any new scarring
that you can tell based on

00:47:40.186 --> 00:47:41.447
what you've seen so far.

00:47:41.447 --> 00:47:42.801
MARISHA: That's very good.

00:47:42.852 --> 00:47:47.318
LAURA: Do I see any sign of tracks or anything?
Dragon tracks?

00:47:47.318 --> 00:47:49.780
MATT: Go ahead and make an investigation check.

00:47:49.780 --> 00:47:53.751
LAURA: Dragging of giant carcasses or just,
y'know, footprints.

00:47:53.751 --> 00:47:55.865
TALIESIN: Yellow 'Dragon Crossing' signs.

00:47:55.865 --> 00:47:57.612
LAURA: Advantage, 'cause it's a dragon.

00:47:57.612 --> 00:47:59.162
MATT: If it's dragon-related.

00:47:59.162 --> 00:48:01.210
LAURA: It is dragon-related. Natural 20.

00:48:01.210 --> 00:48:04.162
MATT: All righty. There are no dragon tracks.

00:48:04.162 --> 00:48:05.325
LAURA: Motherfucker.

00:48:05.325 --> 00:48:09.744
TALIESIN: She licks a tree. "No dragon has been
here."

00:48:09.814 --> 00:48:12.832
(laughter)

00:48:12.832 --> 00:48:15.810
LAURA: I bet there's other tracks, though, that I
totally missed 'cause I was looking for dragons.

00:48:15.810 --> 00:48:17.072
MATT: Yes.

00:48:17.072 --> 00:48:21.114
LAURA: Can I look for anything other than dragons?
There won't be an advantage.

00:48:21.114 --> 00:48:22.527
MATT: Go for it, sure.

00:48:22.527 --> 00:48:28.957
LAURA: I really want that 20, but I don't
get it. This one is not as good. Is this an

00:48:29.008 --> 00:48:31.552
investigation? Perception?

00:48:31.552 --> 00:48:34.644
MATT: Yeah, this would be investigation for you,
sitting down and getting close and looking

00:48:34.644 --> 00:48:36.113
throughout the dirt.

00:48:36.113 --> 00:48:37.204
LAURA: (whispers) 11.

00:48:37.204 --> 00:48:42.813
MATT: 11? You do find tracks, but they're
scattered and they're small feet. Looks like some

00:48:42.813 --> 00:48:46.056
indigenous creatures or wildlife that exists on
this landscape.

00:48:46.056 --> 00:48:47.558
LAURA: Okay. But they were little.

00:48:47.558 --> 00:48:57.398
MATT: They were all little, yeah. As you guys push
through, Allura looks up toward the boughs of the

00:48:57.398 --> 00:49:05.600
dead trees. "While you were preparing, I did some
research on this island, and it seems that there

00:49:05.600 --> 00:49:16.107
"were an indigenous people that lived here before
Opash came. Thousands that made seaward trade

00:49:16.107 --> 00:49:24.553
"routes to the north and the west, and when he made
this his home, the indigenous people were never

00:49:24.553 --> 00:49:30.524
"heard from again. It is believed by many who fare
the seas that this land is cursed and is to be

00:49:30.524 --> 00:49:38.555
"avoided for that reason. This forest, one of the
superstitious points of that reasoning, there are

00:49:38.555 --> 00:49:48.204
"a few that come through hoping to scavenge or find
things from his lost whereabouts, or his own hoard

00:49:48.204 --> 00:49:53.416
"or treasures he may have garnished in his time,
but few of those return as well."

00:49:53.416 --> 00:50:00.747
TALIESIN: Well, if Raishan came back, then who
knows what horrors actually do exist on this

00:50:00.747 --> 00:50:07.117
island? It's possible that she found some of his
notes and built upon them.

00:50:07.117 --> 00:50:08.855
There could be anything.

00:50:08.855 --> 00:50:16.354
MARISHA: Did you read if the island was trapped or
any type of arcane presence on it?

00:50:16.354 --> 00:50:23.229
MATT: "Well, if this was the lair of a
necromancer, an entity that is both selfish and

00:50:23.229 --> 00:50:28.776
"driven towards the personal power and advancement
of their own narcissism, I can imagine that they

00:50:28.776 --> 00:50:36.605
"are very well protected with their secrets. The
fact that this abode was taken by Thordak before

00:50:36.605 --> 00:50:44.626
"he made reign upon the southern side of the
continent... who knows what happened to Opash?"

00:50:44.626 --> 00:50:48.802
MARISHA: Thordak made this his abode?

00:50:48.802 --> 00:50:55.208
MATT: "Yes. Up until he began to wander onto the
continent of Tal'Dorei."

00:50:55.208 --> 00:50:57.548
TALIESIN: Interesting.

00:50:57.548 --> 00:51:02.091
LAURA: Mm-hm.

00:51:02.091 --> 00:51:09.812
TALIESIN: I'm just playing some conjecture in my
head. You have a powerful necromancer, if there's

00:51:09.812 --> 00:51:18.307
any possibility that he could've found a semblance
of unlife, of Opash wandering around, and bent him

00:51:18.307 --> 00:51:23.502
towards his will, then we don't know how that gem
got into his chest in the first place. We don't

00:51:23.502 --> 00:51:30.275
know how any of this happened, and there's just
too much we don't know yet.

00:51:30.275 --> 00:51:31.976
We have to find the cave.

00:51:31.976 --> 00:51:40.479
MATT: "The gem we created. Me, Kima, Drake. As far
as we know, if any of her stories can be believed,

00:51:40.479 --> 00:51:47.208
"Raishan was responsible for the rituals that
embedded it within Thordak's chest on the

00:51:47.208 --> 00:51:53.261
"Plane of Fire during her time with the Fire
Ashari. Once again, as much as we can believe."

00:51:53.338 --> 00:51:56.070
TALIESIN: There's just a lot we don't know.

00:51:56.070 --> 00:51:58.965
MATT: "Let us be careful. Press on."

00:51:58.965 --> 00:52:05.403
LAURA: Tread carefully. Just keep an eye out.
We're keeping eyes out for anything that looks

00:52:05.458 --> 00:52:08.256
different than normal jungle-ness.

00:52:08.256 --> 00:52:11.886
LIAM: You and I head out 20 feet ahead of
everybody and check for traps as we go.

00:52:11.938 --> 00:52:13.215
Carefully.

00:52:13.215 --> 00:52:15.533
MATT: Investigation checks from both you guys, if
you don't mind.

00:52:15.533 --> 00:52:16.684
LIAM: Investigation or--

00:52:16.684 --> 00:52:20.196
MATT: If you're looking for traps specifically?
Investigation.

00:52:20.196 --> 00:52:24.003
LAURA: 26.

00:52:24.003 --> 00:52:25.144
LIAM: 18.

00:52:25.144 --> 00:52:28.854
MATT: Okay. Pushing forward, you guys--

00:52:28.854 --> 00:52:32.805
LAURA: I wasn't just looking for traps, I'm
looking for anything that looks out of place in

00:52:32.805 --> 00:52:37.231
the forest, 'cause I don't know what kind of traps
necessarily would be set by something like this.

00:52:37.231 --> 00:52:39.452
You know what I mean?

00:52:39.452 --> 00:52:48.414
MATT: Sure. In a very Laura Bailey "how much can I
get out of this roll?" I know, I know, I know, I'm

00:52:48.414 --> 00:52:56.126
just messing with you. So as you guys push
forward, you, Vax, notice that the further in you

00:52:56.126 --> 00:53:04.790
go towards this mountain, the trees, still dead,
grey, are even further withered, and many of them

00:53:04.790 --> 00:53:09.360
have just turned to ash and dust. And the closer
you get, the actual treeline grows thinner and

00:53:09.360 --> 00:53:15.444
lower as it seems like the closer it gets to the
mountain, they're bereft of most of their

00:53:15.444 --> 00:53:22.884
structure. You do, Vex, catch as your brother is
moving forward, he is stepping towards a section

00:53:22.884 --> 00:53:30.072
of the earth and sand that has slightly different
texture, ever-so-slightly from the rest, and he's

00:53:30.072 --> 00:53:32.488
but a few feet from stepping into that space.

00:53:32.488 --> 00:53:43.600
LAURA: Vax! Stop! There's some weirdness on the
ground. I feel like it's something.

00:53:43.753 --> 00:53:47.085
LIAM: So you think something's up under the ground
there?

00:53:47.085 --> 00:53:48.312
LAURA: Yeah.

00:53:48.312 --> 00:53:50.563
LIAM: I mean, what do I do at this point?

00:53:50.563 --> 00:53:52.593
MATT: What do you want to do? You look down, and
you--

00:53:52.593 --> 00:53:54.150
LAURA: Don't you see it?

00:53:54.150 --> 00:53:55.406
MATT: It looks almost like--

00:53:55.406 --> 00:53:57.262
LIAM: I'm gonna take a closer look, is what I'm
gonna do.

00:53:57.262 --> 00:54:01.554
MATT: It looks like the difference between sand
and slightly damp sand. The coloration is just

00:54:01.554 --> 00:54:03.461
ever so faintly--

00:54:03.461 --> 00:54:05.463
LAURA: Now that you're looking, now that you're
looking, you can tell, right?

00:54:05.463 --> 00:54:08.234
LIAM: Now that I have context. Context is key, as
always.

00:54:08.234 --> 00:54:11.153
TRAVIS: Can I push him in? No, I'm kidding.

00:54:11.153 --> 00:54:13.173
LAURA: Is it quicksand?

00:54:13.173 --> 00:54:18.259
LIAM: Do I find a trap if I'm looking closer, now,
with her added?

00:54:18.259 --> 00:54:25.859
MATT: I mean, it looks different from the rest.
There's no mechanism there, you don't see a pulley

00:54:25.859 --> 00:54:26.693
or a--

00:54:26.693 --> 00:54:27.939
LAURA: Maybe it's magic.

00:54:27.939 --> 00:54:29.618
LIAM: How much of it looks different?

00:54:29.618 --> 00:54:35.843
MATT: It's avoidable. It's like a ten-, 15-foot
oval area.

00:54:35.843 --> 00:54:40.265
LAURA: Hey, everyone. Let's just not step on this
dark patch, how about that?

00:54:40.265 --> 00:54:41.209
TRAVIS: Why?

00:54:41.209 --> 00:54:43.580
LAURA: 'Cause I think it's like magic or
something, Grog.

00:54:43.580 --> 00:54:44.735
TRAVIS: Like good magic?

00:54:44.735 --> 00:54:45.835
LAURA: Like bad magic.

00:54:45.835 --> 00:54:47.893
TRAVIS: What kind of bad magic?

00:54:47.893 --> 00:54:50.398
LAURA: The kind that would kill us all.

00:54:50.398 --> 00:54:54.465
MARISHA: Like the kind that gives you a really bad
headache.

00:54:54.465 --> 00:54:56.871
TRAVIS: I really don't want another one of those.

00:54:56.871 --> 00:54:58.806
LAURA: Similar sort of thing.

00:54:58.806 --> 00:54:59.829
LIAM: Continue.

00:54:59.829 --> 00:55:05.259
MATT: Now that you've identified that, you've come
across a few more patches, and they seem to grow

00:55:05.259 --> 00:55:12.518
more dense as the trees grow more withered and
gone, until you get to a point where you can now

00:55:12.518 --> 00:55:14.805
see the base of this mountain.

00:55:14.805 --> 00:55:23.027
MARISHA: Can I from a distance maybe do a nature
check? Are these almost like siphons, like wells

00:55:23.027 --> 00:55:26.442
where he was sucking the life force?

00:55:26.442 --> 00:55:28.250
MATT: Make a nature check.

00:55:28.250 --> 00:55:32.032
TALIESIN: Or maybe quicksand? This could be all
the quicksand we were promised as children.

00:55:32.032 --> 00:55:33.022
LAURA: I know, right?

00:55:33.022 --> 00:55:34.523
MARISHA: Oh my gosh. Always quicksand.

00:55:34.583 --> 00:55:36.633
TRAVIS: Seriously. Today's kids do not appreciate
quicksand.

00:55:36.633 --> 00:55:38.279
TALIESIN: It was such a big part of my childhood.

00:55:38.279 --> 00:55:40.334
MARISHA: Why did I never find quicksand? 22.

00:55:40.334 --> 00:55:46.355
MATT: 22. These are less siphons, they're more
what looks to be-- it's a phenomenon known as

00:55:46.355 --> 00:55:55.994
hollow earth, which is when subterranean caverns
go into collapse.

00:55:55.994 --> 00:55:57.340
LIAM: Sinkholes.

00:55:57.340 --> 00:56:03.492
MATT: It can create a sinkhole-like phenomenon,
but hollow earth generally is based on some sort

00:56:03.492 --> 00:56:10.846
of magical release, an explosion of magical energy
beneath the earth that causes-- even though there

00:56:10.846 --> 00:56:16.824
is no space, it erodes the earth from its magic
presence, whether it just completely disintegrates

00:56:16.824 --> 00:56:21.678
or destroys portions of the earth, it leaves this
very, very unstable portion of ground.

00:56:21.678 --> 00:56:26.884
MARISHA: So it's like a magical quasar? That
blasts out?

00:56:26.884 --> 00:56:30.386
MATT: You're not entirely certain what it'll do,
but it's not good.

00:56:30.386 --> 00:56:37.049
TRAVIS: I take one of my new salt lick rocks and I
throw it in one of the little sandy pools.

00:56:37.049 --> 00:56:46.094
MATT: Okay. As you take the rock and throw it into
the sandy pool, it lands with a little bit of dirt

00:56:46.094 --> 00:56:48.559
being kicked up around it and sits there for a
rest.

00:56:48.559 --> 00:56:51.042
TRAVIS: Ooh, magic, huh? Real scary.

00:56:51.042 --> 00:56:52.435
LAURA: And then?

00:56:52.435 --> 00:56:57.540
TALIESIN: Would the rock tell you if it was having
a headache right now? How would it tell you that?

00:56:57.540 --> 00:56:59.507
TRAVIS: I have a psychic connection with my
rocks.

00:56:59.507 --> 00:57:00.714
LIAM: You also weigh a little more--

00:57:00.714 --> 00:57:04.555
MATT: The rock then goes-- it just falls
underneath, and you can see a spot in the ground,

00:57:04.555 --> 00:57:07.517
perfectly shaped where the rock was, that is now
just--

00:57:07.517 --> 00:57:09.094
LAURA: Told you it was dangerous.

00:57:09.094 --> 00:57:11.456
TRAVIS: I actually did that. It's magic.

00:57:11.456 --> 00:57:13.273
LAURA: Good job, Grog.

00:57:13.273 --> 00:57:16.973
TRAVIS: Don't step there.

00:57:16.973 --> 00:57:20.095
MARISHA: You figured it out, Grog, good job.

00:57:20.095 --> 00:57:23.826
TALIESIN: Weird point of contention for my
imagination. Are the trees wilting, or do they

00:57:23.826 --> 00:57:25.816
seem like there was a bit of a blast?

00:57:25.816 --> 00:57:29.082
MATT: They are not leaning a specific direction.

00:57:29.082 --> 00:57:30.717
TALIESIN: Okay, so there's no pattern to it.

00:57:30.717 --> 00:57:33.739
MATT: Yeah, and it isn't like there are were
leaves or anything blown off of them. It just

00:57:33.739 --> 00:57:36.506
looked like they gradually just died rapidly in
place.

00:57:36.506 --> 00:57:38.446
LIAM: Seems like the closer we get, the deader it
gets.

00:57:38.446 --> 00:57:40.798
LAURA: Can we see the mountain that we're getting
towards?

00:57:40.798 --> 00:57:44.594
MATT: Yes, you can, and you guys maneuver around
these spaces to get to the base of it, and it's a

00:57:44.594 --> 00:57:52.782
moderate-sized mountain, nothing impressive on the
outside, it's maybe 600 feet tall at its apex,

00:57:52.782 --> 00:57:58.344
it's more of a large, rocky mound. Make a
perception check.

00:57:58.344 --> 00:58:01.923
LIAM: Natural 20.

00:58:01.923 --> 00:58:05.720
MATT: There's nothing in here. Why do I keep
trying to sip?

00:58:05.720 --> 00:58:08.704
LAURA: 30 is what I rolled, but that's not as good
as a natural 20.

00:58:08.704 --> 00:58:10.519
LIAM: No, it's not.

00:58:10.519 --> 00:58:12.716
LAURA: But 30 is still good.

00:58:12.716 --> 00:58:14.846
MATT: But what's your bonus to perception?

00:58:14.846 --> 00:58:17.275
LIAM: Perception, oh yeah, is 12. So 32.

00:58:17.275 --> 00:58:21.623
MATT: Okay, so close. You guys being at the front
of the party anyway--

00:58:21.623 --> 00:58:25.829
LAURA: Whoa, your perception bonus is higher than
mine? When did that happen?

00:58:25.829 --> 00:58:27.767
TALIESIN: How did you just notice that?

00:58:27.767 --> 00:58:29.627
LIAM: Who fucking knows?

00:58:29.627 --> 00:58:35.773
MATT: As you guys scoot forward, being ahead of
the rest of the party, you glance across the

00:58:35.773 --> 00:58:42.262
surface of this, and most of the rock follows the
familiar pattern of tectonic shift that's broken

00:58:42.262 --> 00:58:47.040
and cracked in places, but it's been, over
hundreds and thousands of years, just settled into

00:58:47.040 --> 00:58:53.459
its natural state. There is one section of rock
just maybe 200 feet from where you are landing at

00:58:53.459 --> 00:59:00.156
the base where it looks like the texture, the
natural lines of the rock, is in a different

00:59:00.156 --> 00:59:08.052
direction. And upon you heading in that direction,
you can see, now, what it appears to be is a large

00:59:08.052 --> 00:59:16.818
rock, very large, maybe 20, 30 feet wide, that is
jammed into an entranceway.

00:59:16.818 --> 00:59:18.761
LIAM: I perceive a rock.

00:59:18.761 --> 00:59:20.377
MARISHA: I got a rock.

00:59:20.377 --> 00:59:25.086
MATT: Kind of. There are a number of strange holes
peppered over the surface.

00:59:25.086 --> 00:59:26.937
LAURA: Like, big holes?

00:59:26.937 --> 00:59:31.462
MATT: About the size of a-- larger than a gold
piece, each hole.

00:59:31.462 --> 00:59:36.714
LAURA: Does it look like it could be, like, things
could come out of it?

00:59:36.714 --> 00:59:38.175
MATT: Possibly?

00:59:38.175 --> 00:59:40.691
LIAM: Checking for traps.

00:59:40.691 --> 00:59:42.398
MATT: You have to check it.

00:59:42.398 --> 00:59:46.019
TRAVIS: You know what Gilmore would do. Put his
hand in it.

00:59:46.019 --> 00:59:48.049
TALIESIN: How very Flash Gordon.

00:59:48.049 --> 00:59:50.743
LIAM: 25 for investigation.

00:59:50.743 --> 00:59:52.241
MATT: Investigation, okay.

00:59:52.241 --> 00:59:54.546
LAURA: Do I need to roll, since he's so good?

00:59:54.546 --> 00:59:55.743
LIAM: Might as well.

00:59:55.743 --> 00:59:59.543
LAURA: What if it's a one? Ooh. No, 24. Damn.

00:59:59.543 --> 01:00:01.448
TRAVIS: Got you a water, Matt.

01:00:01.448 --> 01:00:09.152
MATT: Thank you, sir. So. Are the rest of you guys
following up behind them?

01:00:09.239 --> 01:00:14.584
LIAM: Just wait a moment, wait a moment. No, hang
back for a second.

01:00:14.584 --> 01:00:23.233
MATT: Okay. Between the two of you glancing, you
notice that each one of these holes is actually a

01:00:23.233 --> 01:00:32.430
pierced intrusion upon the rock, something very
quickly jammed itself into the rock to create this

01:00:32.430 --> 01:00:41.446
hole. And they're clustered in places. And you,
with your experience, these claws are respective

01:00:41.446 --> 01:00:49.726
to the size of a very, very, very large dragon.
And it looks like different-- some of them are

01:00:49.726 --> 01:00:55.592
more weathered than others. This boulder has been
placed and pulled back and placed many, many times

01:00:55.592 --> 01:00:57.143
throughout the years.

01:00:57.143 --> 01:01:02.482
LAURA: It's probably too heavy for us to move, but
Grog, do you want to try?

01:01:02.482 --> 01:01:04.760
TALIESIN: I don't know if we should move it.

01:01:04.760 --> 01:01:07.536
LAURA: Well, how do we get in if we don't open the
entrance?

01:01:07.536 --> 01:01:13.597
PATRICK: If nothing else, rather than moving the
whole boulder, is there a way we could just get

01:01:13.597 --> 01:01:15.456
enough of a crack to get in?

01:01:15.493 --> 01:01:18.287
MARISHA: I can Stone Shape it a little bit
thinner.

01:01:18.287 --> 01:01:20.299
LAURA: Ooh, dig. I like that.

01:01:20.299 --> 01:01:24.374
TALIESIN: Just so that if the dragon tries to run,
they have to move a giant boulder, it would be

01:01:24.374 --> 01:01:25.778
really convenient.

01:01:25.778 --> 01:01:27.097
LAURA: Oh, good call.

01:01:27.097 --> 01:01:30.987
MARISHA: Does it look like there's-- am I there? I'm
not there yet.

01:01:31.037 --> 01:01:33.210
MATT: You guys are hanging back.

01:01:33.210 --> 01:01:34.581
LIAM: Kik.

01:01:34.581 --> 01:01:41.488
MARISHA: All right, I'll go up. Is there a crack
that looks like it can kind of just whittle it

01:01:41.488 --> 01:01:44.703
away, that's kind of already started with the
boulder?

01:01:44.703 --> 01:01:51.315
MATT: I mean, the boulder is larger than the
entranceway that it's jammed into, and you're not

01:01:51.315 --> 01:01:56.907
entirely certain what the inside of this cavern
mouth is, if it's just a direct intersection point

01:01:56.907 --> 01:02:00.336
or if it's a gradual influx. You can just try and
push through at

01:02:00.336 --> 01:02:02.124
one of those points if you'd like.

01:02:02.124 --> 01:02:05.439
LAURA: Can you just put a hole in the middle, like
right in the center of the boulder,

01:02:05.439 --> 01:02:06.427
on the ground?

01:02:06.427 --> 01:02:08.556
TALIESIN: Or would it be easier just to scrape
across the side?

01:02:08.556 --> 01:02:15.581
MARISHA: I only have a limited amount of space
that I can carve out, so the boulder might be too

01:02:15.581 --> 01:02:20.958
thick, but if I do it at the seam line, I should
be able to do it. I want to do it at the seam.

01:02:20.958 --> 01:02:26.189
TRAVIS: Do we want to take the first entrance that
we find, I mean, is it really one way in, one way

01:02:26.189 --> 01:02:28.565
out? What if it's just, like, a trap?

01:02:28.565 --> 01:02:31.798
MARISHA: Does someone want to check for traps?

01:02:31.798 --> 01:02:38.524
MATT: They already checked. It did not appear to
be trapped, just a very, very heavy rock.

01:02:38.524 --> 01:02:44.201
TRAVIS: I mean, like, run a perimeter, do any
recon, anything else?

01:02:44.201 --> 01:02:48.195
LAURA: We'd have to run around an entire mountain.
Does it look like there

01:02:48.195 --> 01:02:50.194
could be any other entrances?

01:02:50.194 --> 01:02:52.716
MATT: I mean, you'd have to go around the entire
mountain.

01:02:52.716 --> 01:02:54.699
LAURA: How long would it take if I flew around?

01:02:54.699 --> 01:03:03.267
MATT: Oh, maybe at full speed, hour and a half,
two hours?

01:03:03.267 --> 01:03:05.036
TRAVIS: Fuck that, death first, open the door.

01:03:05.036 --> 01:03:07.207
LAURA: All right, cool cool cool, let's just shape
the boulder.

01:03:07.207 --> 01:03:15.065
MARISHA: Do I want to scry on the inside, or are
we just going in? Do I want to scry and see if

01:03:15.065 --> 01:03:16.614
she's there?

01:03:16.614 --> 01:03:21.369
MATT: This accounts for you flying, stopping,
checking, flying, stopping, checking. You can't

01:03:21.369 --> 01:03:23.986
just check for traps while going by at 50 feet
around.

01:03:23.986 --> 01:03:25.810
TALIESIN: Scrying on the inside.

01:03:25.810 --> 01:03:29.195
MATT: Are you gonna scry?

01:03:29.195 --> 01:03:31.662
MARISHA: Are we just going in?

01:03:31.662 --> 01:03:32.729
TRAVIS: Yeah, we're doing it.

01:03:32.729 --> 01:03:34.757
TALIESIN: I think we'll just go in. I mean, what
are we gonna see that's gonna

01:03:34.757 --> 01:03:36.233
make us change our mind?

01:03:36.233 --> 01:03:39.397
LAURA and MARISHA: Well, if she's not there.

01:03:39.397 --> 01:03:43.987
LAURA: (gasps) Oh, I'm gonna try to detect
dragons! What the fuck?

01:03:43.987 --> 01:03:45.688
MARISHA: Yeah, that's better!

01:03:45.688 --> 01:03:47.508
LAURA: I sit down and go, hmm.

01:03:47.508 --> 01:03:53.361
TRAVIS: Do you have a headache too? Oh my god,
we're all gonna die. I'm patient zero.

01:03:53.361 --> 01:04:00.297
PATRICK: If I'm up by the boulder, too, I will
do-- I don't have a huge range, but I will do

01:04:00.297 --> 01:04:01.605
Divine Sense.

01:04:01.605 --> 01:04:02.708
MATT: Okay.

01:04:02.708 --> 01:04:06.819
PATRICK: I can detect all manner of stuff up to 60
feet.

01:04:06.819 --> 01:04:17.320
MATT: Yes, you can. All righty. So, using your
Divine Sense, let's see here. Okay, so you spend

01:04:17.320 --> 01:04:21.680
your time just focusing, making sure there's
nothing either in or in the immediate vicinity of

01:04:21.680 --> 01:04:27.836
the rock boulder that could be of celestial,
fiend, or undead nature. While you spend a spell

01:04:27.836 --> 01:04:41.125
slot to do your Primeval Awareness. So yes, you do
sense what appear to be three sources of dragon

01:04:41.125 --> 01:04:51.281
life force within the space. Roughly in the
direction of this mountain and below.

01:04:51.281 --> 01:04:59.340
LAURA: They're here, they're here. Oh, god.
(hyperventilates) They're here, she's still here,

01:04:59.340 --> 01:05:02.433
and I think the eggs are okay, 'cause I can still
feel like there's dragons.

01:05:02.433 --> 01:05:03.766
MARISHA: Oh, they're still alive?

01:05:03.766 --> 01:05:04.777
LAURA: I think so.

01:05:04.777 --> 01:05:07.371
MARISHA: God damn it. God. Okay. All right.

01:05:07.371 --> 01:05:13.161
LAURA: I just did it within a mile, so is that
okay? Was that within a mile?

01:05:13.161 --> 01:05:15.776
MATT: I believe it's--

01:05:15.776 --> 01:05:17.975
LAURA: Or did I need to spend longer?

01:05:17.975 --> 01:05:25.223
MATT: For that one, it is for one minute per level
of the spell. And it's within one mile, up to six

01:05:25.223 --> 01:05:27.091
miles if you're in your favored terrain.

01:05:27.091 --> 01:05:30.274
LAURA: Oh, so I am, because it's woods, right?
Wooded?

01:05:30.274 --> 01:05:34.501
MATT: It's not wooded anymore, so it's one mile.
So you know at least they're within a mile.

01:05:34.501 --> 01:05:36.184
MARISHA: That's big.

01:05:36.184 --> 01:05:37.742
TALIESIN: That's huge.

01:05:37.742 --> 01:05:39.177
MARISHA: All right.

01:05:39.177 --> 01:05:41.175
LIAM: So this is happening.

01:05:41.175 --> 01:05:45.729
MARISHA: Does anyone need to do anything else
before we go in?

01:05:45.729 --> 01:05:47.486
LAURA: I have to go take a poo.

01:05:47.486 --> 01:05:49.476
MARISHA: I have to pee, too. I have to pee so
bad.

01:05:49.476 --> 01:05:51.436
(laughter)

01:05:51.436 --> 01:05:53.170
MATT: Was that in character?

01:05:53.170 --> 01:05:54.587
MARISHA: It's both?

01:05:54.587 --> 01:05:56.513
LAURA: I'm so nervous.

01:05:56.513 --> 01:05:58.466
MARISHA: Little bit of both.

01:05:58.466 --> 01:06:02.669
LAURA: All right.

01:06:02.669 --> 01:06:04.783
MATT: So what's the plan, guys?

01:06:04.783 --> 01:06:06.497
LAURA: We're gonna go in? Let's go in!

01:06:06.497 --> 01:06:08.897
MARISHA: Does anyone need to do a thing?

01:06:08.897 --> 01:06:14.347
LAURA: I mean, I don't know if we're gonna have to
go through. And it only lasts for a minute, so I

01:06:14.347 --> 01:06:16.489
feel like we're gonna be in the caves longer than--

01:06:16.489 --> 01:06:17.467
MARISHA: Okay, okay, okay.

01:06:17.544 --> 01:06:19.397
LAURA: So we're still stealthing.

01:06:19.397 --> 01:06:25.126
TRAVIS: Wait, actually, can I pull Vex aside real
quick? Can I talk to you

01:06:25.126 --> 01:06:26.730
just real fast before we--

01:06:26.730 --> 01:06:27.529
LAURA: Me?

01:06:27.529 --> 01:06:30.357
TRAVIS: Yeah, like a little further away, like in
private?

01:06:30.357 --> 01:06:34.640
LAURA: Grog. I'm already seeing someone.

01:06:34.640 --> 01:06:42.893
TRAVIS: No, I know. I hate to beat a dead bush.
Horse? Cow? I hate to beat a dead cow, but I

01:06:42.893 --> 01:06:47.182
really did like that little magic thing I found.

01:06:47.182 --> 01:06:48.863
LAURA: What little magic thing, darling?

01:06:48.863 --> 01:06:52.907
TRAVIS: When we were looting and stuff? And I've
been really worried about you. I know you like to

01:06:52.907 --> 01:06:58.331
bargain, right? So I thought I could trade you
back for what I found. And I have this little

01:06:58.331 --> 01:07:04.297
Parapet of Wound Closure, you've been dying so
much, right? And if you wear this and you die, you

01:07:04.297 --> 01:07:08.186
immediately stabilize on your next turn. I figured
it'd be a good trade.

01:07:08.235 --> 01:07:12.918
LAURA: Do I have to attune to that, Grog?

01:07:12.918 --> 01:07:14.524
TRAVIS: No.

01:07:14.524 --> 01:07:17.177
LAURA: You're lying.

01:07:17.177 --> 01:07:24.591
TRAVIS: It's a big word. I don't really know what
you're saying. I really liked it. I mean, it made

01:07:24.591 --> 01:07:27.344
a magic sword when I touched it.

01:07:27.344 --> 01:07:28.931
LAURA: Grog, and then it gave you a headache!

01:07:28.931 --> 01:07:36.237
TRAVIS: Yeah, but I can deal with a headache. I
won't-- I just, I found it, you know?

01:07:36.237 --> 01:07:40.945
LAURA: Grog. (yells) Grog!

01:07:40.945 --> 01:07:42.309
TRAVIS: What?

01:07:42.309 --> 01:07:46.476
LAURA: This is awful. No, it's so bad for you.

01:07:46.476 --> 01:07:49.138
TRAVIS: Look, you won't die, you won't die.

01:07:49.138 --> 01:07:54.598
LAURA: (laughing) You motherfucker.

01:07:54.598 --> 01:07:57.298
TRAVIS: It's only 'cause I'm looking out for you.

01:07:57.298 --> 01:07:58.597
LAURA: Oh my god.

01:07:58.597 --> 01:08:00.338
LIAM: It's the wedding all over again.

01:08:00.338 --> 01:08:02.608
LAURA: You see how hard this is when people want
their boots back, when people

01:08:02.608 --> 01:08:03.932
want their decks back...

01:08:03.932 --> 01:08:06.866
LIAM: Don't compare the boots to the deck, are you
kidding me?

01:08:06.866 --> 01:08:10.004
LAURA: You did find it.

01:08:10.004 --> 01:08:12.119
TALIESIN: Technically, it's somebody else's.

01:08:12.119 --> 01:08:14.666
LIAM: What do you care what he says?

01:08:14.666 --> 01:08:19.899
LAURA: Grog. You have to promise me you won't pull
anything from it. All you can do is hold onto it.

01:08:19.899 --> 01:08:25.828
That's all you can do. You can't look at anything,
you have to keep it in its little pouch.

01:08:25.828 --> 01:08:32.499
TRAVIS: Okay. Yeah, I don't look at anything, I
keep it in its little pouch, I don't pull

01:08:32.499 --> 01:08:35.920
anything. I promise.

01:08:35.920 --> 01:08:42.433
LAURA: So, you know in Guardians of the Galaxy,
when he gives him that little ball at the end?

01:08:42.433 --> 01:08:43.754
MATT: Yeah.

01:08:43.754 --> 01:08:50.229
LAURA: Can I do that? Can I give him a pouch?
Here's your cards back. But don't look at them,

01:08:50.229 --> 01:08:53.871
Grog. They're really dangerous. All right?

01:08:53.871 --> 01:08:56.087
TRAVIS: You want to trade?

01:08:56.087 --> 01:08:57.598
LAURA: Yeah, give me the necklace.

01:08:57.598 --> 01:09:01.158
TRAVIS: Okay, there. I take the cards.

01:09:01.158 --> 01:09:03.996
MATT: Okay. So what are you giving him?

01:09:03.996 --> 01:09:08.906
LAURA: A little pouch that's the shape of the deck
of cards.

01:09:08.906 --> 01:09:11.921
MATT: How do you make the pouch the shape of
cards?

01:09:11.921 --> 01:09:15.267
LAURA: It's maybe not that good of a pouch, but
it's Grog.

01:09:15.267 --> 01:09:17.628
MATT: Make a sleight-of-hand check with
disadvantage.

01:09:17.628 --> 01:09:18.870
LAURA: Okay.

01:09:18.870 --> 01:09:20.662
TALIESIN: Aw, man.

01:09:20.662 --> 01:09:25.039
LIAM: Yeah, everybody saw through it immediately,
just so you know.

01:09:25.039 --> 01:09:33.295
LAURA: Well, obviously! But it's Grog. That's
really bad. He's gonna be able to tell. Nine?

01:09:33.295 --> 01:09:41.696
MATT: Go ahead and roll a perception check, Grog.

01:09:41.696 --> 01:09:44.866
TRAVIS: Six.

01:09:44.866 --> 01:09:46.737
TALIESIN: Yes!

01:09:46.737 --> 01:09:53.020
MATT: The trade is complete. She hands you your
deck of cards, she takes her

01:09:53.020 --> 01:09:55.338
Parapet of Wound Closure.

01:09:55.338 --> 01:09:57.694
LAURA: Oh my god, I'm in so much trouble!

01:09:57.694 --> 01:09:59.914
(laughter)

01:09:59.914 --> 01:10:03.116
PATRICK: I like to think that there's a live
kitten in this pouch.

01:10:03.116 --> 01:10:05.611
(laughter)

01:10:05.611 --> 01:10:08.176
MATT: If you pull the right card, yeah.

01:10:08.176 --> 01:10:10.621
LIAM: Well, you saved the party, but your marriage
is in jeopardy.

01:10:10.621 --> 01:10:16.076
LAURA: I know. He's so mad at me! He's so mad.
It's really good that he's sitting over at the

01:10:16.076 --> 01:10:18.068
other table right now.

01:10:18.068 --> 01:10:19.874
TALIESIN: I'm gonna get the wrath of this.

01:10:19.874 --> 01:10:21.383
MARISHA: I know, we have him!

01:10:21.383 --> 01:10:24.716
TALIESIN: I can feel the heat emanating right
now.

01:10:24.716 --> 01:10:35.045
MATT: So, feeling satisfied that your imploring of
Vex and a trade you've made, your shiny package of

01:10:35.045 --> 01:10:40.437
happy cards are back in your possession, but you
promised, at the moment, at least--

01:10:40.437 --> 01:10:42.717
TRAVIS: To not look at them. All right.

01:10:42.717 --> 01:10:46.158
MATT: While she's right there in front of you,
yeah.

01:10:46.158 --> 01:10:49.064
TRAVIS: Thank you, Vex. That really means the
world.

01:10:49.064 --> 01:10:51.264
LAURA: Seriously, though, they're really, really
dangerous.

01:10:51.330 --> 01:10:54.698
TRAVIS: I know, they're really special. I won't
look at them or anything. That means a lot. I

01:10:54.698 --> 01:10:58.797
don't find a lot of great things. I did find a
couple rocks, earlier, if you want them.

01:10:58.797 --> 01:11:00.578
LAURA: Oh, they're yours.

01:11:00.578 --> 01:11:04.195
TRAVIS: Okay. Are you sure? You're not gonna try
and steal that shit, too?

01:11:04.195 --> 01:11:05.858
LAURA: No, I promise.

01:11:05.858 --> 01:11:11.293
TRAVIS: Cool. Let's go kill a dragon. And I
jauntily and cheerily walk back to the group.

01:11:11.293 --> 01:11:13.977
(laughter)

01:11:13.977 --> 01:11:16.304
LIAM: He looks happy. What was that about?

01:11:16.304 --> 01:11:20.640
LAURA: (nervous laughter) Oh, I just gave him back
his cards, is all.

01:11:20.640 --> 01:11:24.817
TRAVIS: So happy to be reunited.

01:11:24.817 --> 01:11:27.051
TALIESIN: I'm so proud of you.

01:11:27.051 --> 01:11:28.870
MATT: All right, so. What are the rest of you
doing in the meantime?

01:11:28.870 --> 01:11:34.340
MARISHA: You've got a little bead of sweat on your
forehead, Vex. It's such a humid jungle.

01:11:34.340 --> 01:11:37.134
LIAM: We zoom in on the single drop.

01:11:37.134 --> 01:11:45.083
MARISHA: I'm waiting to sculpt a hole in the
door.

01:11:45.083 --> 01:11:52.059
MATT: Okay. So, using Stone Shape, you can-- a
section of stone no more than five feet in any

01:11:52.059 --> 01:11:59.247
dimension, and form in any shape that suits your
purpose. So. You can make a small passage, as long

01:11:59.247 --> 01:12:05.238
as it is no more than five feet thick. The wall
and the stone are both thicker than five feet. You

01:12:05.238 --> 01:12:14.356
can begin to make a slight passageway. You can
create enough of a crack with your spell, as it

01:12:14.356 --> 01:12:20.396
completes, which, mark off your 4th-level spell,
but as you create it, you do manage to pierce, and

01:12:20.396 --> 01:12:25.639
you can look into the darkness of the tunnel
behind, but through the full use of the spell, you

01:12:25.639 --> 01:12:32.326
create this kind of tunnel intrusion into the side
of this mountain, and you only

01:12:32.326 --> 01:12:34.295
get that much of opening.

01:12:34.295 --> 01:12:36.068
MARISHA: Son of a bitch.

01:12:36.068 --> 01:12:38.077
TALIESIN: No, this is an excellent start.

01:12:38.077 --> 01:12:43.880
MARISHA: All right. In spelunker-Keyleth mode, I'm
looking through the hole with my Darkvision.

01:12:43.880 --> 01:12:45.543
MATT: Okay, perception check.

01:12:45.543 --> 01:12:46.637
MARISHA: What do I see?

01:12:46.637 --> 01:12:48.323
LIAM: Fanart, please.

01:12:48.323 --> 01:12:50.635
MATT: Keyleth in The Descent.

01:12:50.635 --> 01:12:53.359
MARISHA: Oh, son of a bitch! That's a one.

01:12:53.359 --> 01:12:55.181
LAURA: What do you see, Keyleth?

01:12:55.181 --> 01:12:56.623
LIAM: You just got James Franco'd.

01:12:56.623 --> 01:12:59.093
MARISHA: It's so fucking dark, you guys.

01:12:59.093 --> 01:13:08.771
LAURA: How about I try-- Oh! What if we light an
arrow, can I do an Oracle Arrow through the hole?

01:13:08.771 --> 01:13:13.527
MARISHA: I shimmy out and say, Vex, go in the
hole.

01:13:13.527 --> 01:13:23.348
MATT: Okay. All right. So you pull back the arrow,
you fire it through. The arrow-- go ahead and make

01:13:23.348 --> 01:13:25.239
an attack roll.

01:13:25.239 --> 01:13:29.402
LAURA: I'm getting death looks. Natural 20!

01:13:29.402 --> 01:13:35.697
MATT: You fire the Oracle Arrow at just the right
angle where it doesn't hit any of the walls, it

01:13:35.697 --> 01:13:42.630
just arcs off straight, before it eventually
begins to curve. And what you do as you pass along

01:13:42.630 --> 01:13:48.276
with this arrow, with your Darkvision, you can
see, down the tunnel there is no light source.

01:13:48.276 --> 01:13:57.639
There is a layer of untouched dust all across the
ground, and interesting texture the further in you

01:13:57.639 --> 01:14:06.449
go. And then eventually, about 100 feet or so in,
the tunnel begins to curve to the left and descend

01:14:06.449 --> 01:14:11.763
before the arrow lands and sticks into the rock
there, splintering a little bit, and your vision

01:14:11.763 --> 01:14:17.818
now sits there with the arrow. There doesn't
appear to be any movement. It is silent and

01:14:17.818 --> 01:14:18.835
pitch-black.

01:14:18.835 --> 01:14:21.103
LAURA: Okay. And nothing had walked, it didn't
look like there were any tracks.

01:14:21.103 --> 01:14:22.534
It was just heavy dust.

01:14:22.534 --> 01:14:24.833
MATT: From what you could see from the arrow
rushing past it, yeah.

01:14:24.833 --> 01:14:26.719
LIAM: And that gap is just this much?

01:14:26.719 --> 01:14:28.058
MATT: It's about that big, yeah.

01:14:28.058 --> 01:14:30.735
LIAM: And does it go in like that, like a long
tunnel of that, or is it--

01:14:30.735 --> 01:14:32.318
could I reach my arm through?

01:14:32.318 --> 01:14:34.618
MATT: You could reach your arm through.
Essentially, it's like the edge of the wall of

01:14:34.618 --> 01:14:40.201
this tunnel and the rock were kind of jammed
together, and she punched through just enough to

01:14:40.201 --> 01:14:45.626
push past where the rock and the wall had hit, and
it created this slight opening, but there's still

01:14:45.626 --> 01:14:47.168
a bunch of stone there.

01:14:47.168 --> 01:14:48.410
LIAM: Shit.

01:14:48.410 --> 01:14:50.015
TALIESIN: It's okay, there's options.

01:14:50.015 --> 01:14:52.886
LAURA: I shimmy out. It's just a tunnel.

01:14:52.886 --> 01:14:54.769
TALIESIN: That's good.

01:14:54.769 --> 01:14:56.155
LAURA: Yeah, it's a long tunnel.

01:14:56.155 --> 01:15:01.036
PATRICK: That means we could make a little bit of
noise getting in here, maybe.

01:15:01.036 --> 01:15:07.919
LAURA: Potentially. Raishan, I think, has rather
good hearing. If we make a lot of noise, it might

01:15:07.919 --> 01:15:09.134
echo down.

01:15:09.134 --> 01:15:10.929
PATRICK: Right.

01:15:10.929 --> 01:15:16.225
TALIESIN: We have no way of keeping silent, do we?
We don't have any way of--

01:15:16.225 --> 01:15:25.357
MARISHA: I could try, like what you said. I can
always, worst-case scenario, burn another

01:15:25.357 --> 01:15:28.378
4th-level to finish this off.

01:15:28.378 --> 01:15:30.034
TRAVIS: For a door?

01:15:30.034 --> 01:15:32.848
TALIESIN: We've spent more opening a door.

01:15:32.848 --> 01:15:34.678
MARISHA: Yes, we have.

01:15:34.678 --> 01:15:37.083
TRAVIS: We don't have to spend anything. I'll just
beat the shit out of it.

01:15:37.083 --> 01:15:38.758
TALIESIN: You're our last resort at this point.

01:15:38.758 --> 01:15:40.688
LAURA: But you do have siege gauntlets, though.

01:15:40.688 --> 01:15:45.559
TRAVIS: I do, yeah. I actually have those, like,
no one's taken them from me.

01:15:45.559 --> 01:15:48.353
(laughter)

01:15:48.353 --> 01:15:51.234
LIAM: Why do you say that right now? How is that
relevant to the conversation at hand?

01:15:51.234 --> 01:15:58.903
TRAVIS: I just mean, like, they're mine, you know.
They work for me, they speak to me. Yeah.

01:15:58.903 --> 01:16:00.903
LIAM: I've always said as much.

01:16:00.903 --> 01:16:04.289
MARISHA: Do you have a relationship with all of
your inanimate objects?

01:16:04.289 --> 01:16:05.951
TRAVIS: I try to work on it at night.

01:16:05.951 --> 01:16:07.072
MARISHA: Sure.

01:16:07.072 --> 01:16:10.798
TALIESIN: Wow, I actually do blame myself for
this. This is interesting.

01:16:10.798 --> 01:16:13.291
MARISHA: Why would you say that, Percy?

01:16:13.291 --> 01:16:14.886
TALIESIN: I don't know.

01:16:14.886 --> 01:16:17.498
MARISHA: Man, I feel like there's a lot of
secrets.

01:16:17.498 --> 01:16:21.878
LAURA: What do you think? Should we burn another
4th, or should we have Grog punch the little hole

01:16:21.878 --> 01:16:23.176
a little bit?

01:16:23.176 --> 01:16:24.973
MARISHA: Well, let me see. I crawl back in the
hole.

01:16:24.973 --> 01:16:26.242
MATT: Okay.

01:16:26.242 --> 01:16:27.578
MARISHA: All right.

01:16:27.578 --> 01:16:28.988
MATT: All right.

01:16:28.988 --> 01:16:39.111
MARISHA: You know how, like, a blade of grass can
break a block of concrete?

01:16:39.111 --> 01:16:40.889
LAURA: What?

01:16:40.889 --> 01:16:43.088
MARISHA: I'm doing some monk shit, all right?

01:16:43.088 --> 01:16:45.145
(laughter)

01:16:45.173 --> 01:16:59.967
MARISHA: Okay. Go with me. Okay. You know how
plants can break stone when they grow through? If

01:16:59.967 --> 01:17:07.944
I do a Druidcraft cantrip and try and grow some
plants through this hole, will it maybe help crack

01:17:07.944 --> 01:17:08.991
open a bigger hole?

01:17:08.991 --> 01:17:11.131
TRAVIS: Can you fast-forward 1000 years?

01:17:11.131 --> 01:17:12.685
MATT: (creeper hissing)

01:17:12.685 --> 01:17:20.979
MARISHA: No, creeper. No creeper. Okay. I shimmy
back out and I say, no, apparently that takes like

01:17:20.979 --> 01:17:22.179
1000 years.

01:17:22.179 --> 01:17:24.087
(laughter)

01:17:24.087 --> 01:17:28.017
LAURA: Grog. You wanna go punch some shit?

01:17:28.017 --> 01:17:39.358
PATRICK: Hold on for one second. I know you can move this
stone, if it allows you to only move certain parts

01:17:39.358 --> 01:17:50.362
of it, could you use the stone you can shape to
effectively carve out a chunk that could be pulled

01:17:50.362 --> 01:17:59.280
out? Like a very thin, narrow, like just move as
much as a finger's-width around and then we could

01:17:59.280 --> 01:18:03.743
pull that out instead of just pushing it all the
way like clay?

01:18:03.743 --> 01:18:06.758
MATT: I mean, it could be, but one spell's already
been spent.

01:18:06.758 --> 01:18:08.685
LAURA: So it would just be another spell slot.

01:18:08.685 --> 01:18:09.923
MATT: But it would work.

01:18:09.923 --> 01:18:14.491
PATRICK: It would be another spell, but that would
be just two to get in, as opposed to endlessly

01:18:14.491 --> 01:18:17.171
throwing spell after spell at this.

01:18:17.239 --> 01:18:21.658
LAURA: Well, Grog has siege gauntlets, so he could
potentially do some damage to the rock, but it

01:18:21.658 --> 01:18:22.929
would make noise.

01:18:22.929 --> 01:18:27.789
LIAM: One second. Percy. I have a nutball idea
that maybe you could turn into a better one.

01:18:27.789 --> 01:18:29.890
LAURA: Doors!

01:18:29.890 --> 01:18:34.832
LIAM: I pull out the Oil of Etherealness that I've
been carrying for ages.

01:18:34.832 --> 01:18:36.111
MARISHA: The What of Whatness?

01:18:36.111 --> 01:18:39.582
LIAM: This, it's goop, you rub it on yourself and
you become ethereal for an hour.

01:18:39.582 --> 01:18:41.595
But I can't do it.

01:18:41.595 --> 01:18:42.868
LAURA: Why?

01:18:42.868 --> 01:18:48.473
LIAM: There's not enough to cover me. But Scanlan
could do it or Pike could do it and could walk

01:18:48.473 --> 01:18:50.027
through the rock.

01:18:50.027 --> 01:18:51.446
LAURA: And then do what?

01:18:51.446 --> 01:18:56.133
LIAM: Look around, see if there's anything to-- I
don't know. I prefaced it with saying it was a

01:18:56.133 --> 01:18:59.496
shitty idea, and I spoke to the brain to see if he
could come up with something better.

01:18:59.496 --> 01:19:01.386
TRAVIS: We looked for a switch, right?

01:19:01.386 --> 01:19:03.972
MARISHA: It's a giant rock. It's a boulder.

01:19:03.972 --> 01:19:06.334
TALIESIN: With handholds on it. It's Fortress of
Solitude.

01:19:06.334 --> 01:19:08.472
TRAVIS: Can I look for a switch?

01:19:08.472 --> 01:19:10.397
MATT: Make an investigation check.

01:19:10.397 --> 01:19:16.857
TRAVIS: If I solve this... 19. Oh, minus... 17.

01:19:16.857 --> 01:19:21.243
MATT: 17. Looking around as they're having this
conversation, there's no switches, but you do see

01:19:21.243 --> 01:19:26.643
fingerholds, like big, dragon-sized fingerholds,
like something grabbed it and jammed this boulder

01:19:26.643 --> 01:19:27.874
in there.

01:19:27.874 --> 01:19:33.497
PATRICK: I actually want to kind of take a look
around, too, because if this is a naturally formed

01:19:33.497 --> 01:19:40.656
rock, a naturally formed opening, this is not like
a cork in a bottle. There has to be some parts

01:19:40.656 --> 01:19:49.493
that don't fit really smoothly. Have we found the
best place to make our incursion? Is there an

01:19:49.493 --> 01:19:55.218
opening? Is there any-- this can't fit snugly into
this unless it's been shaped for that purpose.

01:19:55.218 --> 01:20:04.839
TALIESIN: We can now get enough of a hold to make
a lever and move the boulder out a little bit, get

01:20:04.839 --> 01:20:10.382
us all in, and then drop it back into place. In
theory. We have this hole now that's big enough

01:20:10.382 --> 01:20:17.333
for, let's say, a magical weapon that can't be
destroyed? And we can just apply as much pressure,

01:20:17.333 --> 01:20:21.268
put a bunch of other people pushing on the other
side and see if we can open it up enough to get in

01:20:21.268 --> 01:20:23.002
and then let it close behind us.

01:20:23.002 --> 01:20:25.278
LIAM: How would Bigby be in this situation?

01:20:25.278 --> 01:20:27.443
MARISHA: Bigby would be an upper-level spell.

01:20:27.443 --> 01:20:29.700
TALIESIN: I don't want to burn that right now.

01:20:29.700 --> 01:20:37.116
MARISHA: Grog. Do you want to try and use some of
your basic mechanics of physics? Of leveraging?

01:20:37.116 --> 01:20:42.767
TRAVIS: I don't know what that is, but I will
assault this stone with a quickness.

01:20:42.767 --> 01:20:44.472
LAURA: Do it! Just get us in.

01:20:44.472 --> 01:20:50.164
MARISHA: Don't assault it. Don't insul-- don't
insult or assault it. If you could just--

01:20:50.164 --> 01:20:52.085
TRAVIS: There's no joy in either of them.

01:20:52.085 --> 01:20:55.021
MARISHA: I know. I know. This one isn't for you.

01:20:55.021 --> 01:20:59.176
TALIESIN: Who's got a magical weapon that's very
long?

01:20:59.176 --> 01:21:00.455
TRAVIS: Kima.

01:21:00.455 --> 01:21:07.215
MARISHA: If you could take Kima's sword, pry open
a crack, let us slip in--

01:21:07.215 --> 01:21:09.902
TRAVIS: You ask Kima for the Holy Avenger, I'm not
taking that.

01:21:09.902 --> 01:21:12.009
MARISHA: Well, don't you have the dragon sword?

01:21:12.009 --> 01:21:14.826
TRAVIS: You ask Kima for her sword. See how that
goes.

01:21:14.826 --> 01:21:15.889
TALIESIN: Kima.

01:21:15.889 --> 01:21:17.290
MATT: "Yes?"

01:21:17.290 --> 01:21:22.941
TALIESIN: We're thinking about building a giant
lever. Could you put your sword in that hole and

01:21:22.941 --> 01:21:25.804
help us pull very, very hard to see if we can move
this boulder?

01:21:25.883 --> 01:21:28.440
MATT: "Will it damage the sword?"

01:21:28.440 --> 01:21:29.737
TALIESIN: In theory, no.

01:21:29.737 --> 01:21:31.099
LAURA: In theory.

01:21:31.099 --> 01:21:33.667
TALIESIN: It's a magical sword. Can you break a
magical sword with pressure?

01:21:33.667 --> 01:21:37.647
MATT: "You ding it, you pay."

01:21:37.647 --> 01:21:47.417
TALIESIN: That's fair. So I'm going to try and
build this lever. All of us are going to

01:21:47.417 --> 01:21:51.111
put pressure in the other direction, we're going
to try and have as many of us moving this thing

01:21:51.111 --> 01:21:56.460
just a couple feet. Not far. Just far enough to
make an opening to get as many of us through as

01:21:56.517 --> 01:21:57.764
possible.

01:21:57.764 --> 01:22:00.742
MATT: All right, so who's doing the leverage?

01:22:00.742 --> 01:22:01.930
LIAM: Pike is.

01:22:01.930 --> 01:22:03.750
LAURA and MARISHA: Definitely Pike.

01:22:03.750 --> 01:22:08.177
MATT: Okay, well, the size of the sword, at most
it's going to be one person assisting the main

01:22:08.177 --> 01:22:13.864
person. Which would be Pike assisting Grog. All
right. So as the rest of you guys get on the other

01:22:13.864 --> 01:22:17.695
side, Grog, I want you to go ahead and roll a
strength check.

01:22:17.695 --> 01:22:19.814
MARISHA: Pike and Grog, Pike and Grog.

01:22:19.814 --> 01:22:22.381
MATT: With advantage because of Pike's aid on
this.

01:22:22.381 --> 01:22:27.057
TRAVIS: Thank god. 23.

01:22:27.057 --> 01:22:34.230
MATT: 23, okay. As you guys get on the other side,
before you even start getting into position, Grog

01:22:34.230 --> 01:22:38.579
already begins to pull back on the sword. You
watch as Kima keeps glancing over her shoulder

01:22:38.579 --> 01:22:47.697
like (worried noise). Waiting for it to just snap.
But the large rock, the boulder begins to shift

01:22:47.697 --> 01:22:52.438
ever-so-slightly. You watch as dust and other
small pebbles begin to clatter down the outside of

01:22:52.438 --> 01:22:56.994
the rock. You all get on the other side and, all
together as a group,

01:22:56.994 --> 01:22:59.399
everyone else make strength checks.

01:22:59.399 --> 01:23:03.366
PATRICK: We can use the rod of immobility to brace
it if we need to.

01:23:03.366 --> 01:23:06.770
LAURA: Yeah, that's a good call, because we have
two of them, now.

01:23:06.770 --> 01:23:08.389
MARISHA: Oh, that's such a good idea.

01:23:08.389 --> 01:23:11.845
TALIESIN: We have holes drilled in the stone by
dragon feet.

01:23:11.845 --> 01:23:17.021
MARISHA: We can just wedge it in there. Yeah.
That's a good call, you guys. Wait, we're all

01:23:17.021 --> 01:23:18.596
doing a strength check?

01:23:18.596 --> 01:23:19.975
LAURA: 12.

01:23:19.975 --> 01:23:20.969
MARISHA: Just straight strength?

01:23:20.969 --> 01:23:23.360
MATT: Straight strength, so add your strength
modifier.

01:23:23.360 --> 01:23:24.349
TALIESIN: 17.

01:23:24.349 --> 01:23:25.302
MARISHA: 13.

01:23:25.302 --> 01:23:26.507
LIAM: 16.

01:23:26.507 --> 01:23:27.899
LAURA: Did you want Pike's?

01:23:27.899 --> 01:23:29.496
LIAM: To do what, help prop it up?

01:23:29.496 --> 01:23:33.295
TALIESIN: Scanlan rolled a four.

01:23:33.295 --> 01:23:40.711
MATT: Okay. Okay. So you manage to get about a
foot and a half--

01:23:40.711 --> 01:23:43.074
LAURA: Trinket rolled a 19.

01:23:43.074 --> 01:23:47.762
MATT: Okay. So Trinket's also pushing as well.
There isn't a whole lot of surface area here to

01:23:47.762 --> 01:23:53.675
really aid, it's mostly on you, Grog, and you
manage to get about a foot and a half wide before

01:23:53.675 --> 01:24:00.403
you pull out the Immovable Rods and Kerrek, and
anybody else who wants to help, you manage to jam

01:24:00.403 --> 01:24:07.538
them into two of the finger-holes, and as soon as they
lock in, you can release the weapon and it's just

01:24:07.538 --> 01:24:14.859
enough to hold it in place, although it is slowly
moving. Each rod can only hold 8,000 pounds. Mind

01:24:14.859 --> 01:24:18.954
you, it's not holding it entirely aloft, it seems
to be holding okay for now.

01:24:18.954 --> 01:24:21.966
LIAM: I immediately throw Whisper through the
crack and bamf through.

01:24:21.966 --> 01:24:23.452
TALIESIN: I scootch.

01:24:23.452 --> 01:24:24.440
LAURA: I scootch.

01:24:24.440 --> 01:24:27.334
MATT: You guys all pull through. Kima immediately
rushes and grabs the sword. You guys charge into

01:24:27.334 --> 01:24:28.337
the darkness.

01:24:28.337 --> 01:24:31.863
LAURA: Can Trinket get in or do I need to bamf him
in the necklace and bamf him out? Okay, that's

01:24:31.863 --> 01:24:33.012
what I do.

01:24:33.012 --> 01:24:36.870
MATT: You guys all do get inside the tunnel. The
boulder does appear to be stationary.

01:24:36.870 --> 01:24:43.461
LAURA: Should we leave it open, or should we take
the rods? We might need to get out in a hurry.

01:24:43.461 --> 01:24:48.057
TALIESIN: What a wonderfully convenient way to
close. And it also means that the dragon will not

01:24:48.057 --> 01:24:50.124
be able to open the door.

01:24:50.124 --> 01:24:51.471
MARISHA: Because it's wedged?

01:24:51.471 --> 01:24:52.687
TALIESIN: It's wedged shut.

01:24:52.687 --> 01:25:00.257
MARISHA: She could turn into a person. She can
also teleport. Let's not forget that. Okay, let's

01:25:00.257 --> 01:25:01.413
keep going.

01:25:01.413 --> 01:25:03.317
MATT: All right.

01:25:03.317 --> 01:25:07.635
TALIESIN: Just, let's remember to pick those up,
if there's anybody left to get them.

01:25:07.635 --> 01:25:14.031
MATT: You guys now stand in the 15-foot-wide,
about 12-foot-tall, tunnel entrance to this

01:25:14.031 --> 01:25:20.722
mountainside. As you saw before, the floor itself
has a layer of dust. There's a heavy smell of

01:25:20.722 --> 01:25:33.891
ancient rot and stagnant water and wet earth. The
rock walls of the pathway are rough, but appear to

01:25:33.891 --> 01:25:38.400
have been intentionally carved for a purpose more
than any sort of presentational element of it.

01:25:38.400 --> 01:25:44.863
There's no wind, there's no movement of air.
Everything in here has been, at least in this

01:25:44.863 --> 01:25:51.498
portion of it, still and untouched for quite some
time. As you guys push forward through this

01:25:51.498 --> 01:25:54.360
tunnel, to where it begins to make its slow
descent--

01:25:54.360 --> 01:25:55.725
LAURA: Stealth.

01:25:55.725 --> 01:25:57.543
MATT: You guys? All right.

01:25:57.543 --> 01:26:06.907
LIAM: Checking, checking, checking. 24.

01:26:06.907 --> 01:26:11.268
LAURA: Oh, this is investigation.

01:26:11.268 --> 01:26:12.981
TALIESIN: I thought you were stealthing.

01:26:12.981 --> 01:26:14.955
LAURA: Oh, was that a stealth roll or an
investigation roll?

01:26:14.955 --> 01:26:16.459
That was investigation, right?

01:26:16.459 --> 01:26:18.614
MATT: That was investigation. 24?

01:26:18.614 --> 01:26:20.119
LAURA: Dogshit. 11.

01:26:20.119 --> 01:26:25.464
MATT: Okay. We'll have to make-- we'll say, make
new stealth checks since you guys have come out of

01:26:25.464 --> 01:26:32.311
stealth and you're back in. But as you guys are
moving down the curvature of the tunnel, Vax, you

01:26:32.311 --> 01:26:40.591
notice that there are, amongst the dust and
pebbles of the floor, small pieces and chunks of

01:26:40.591 --> 01:26:48.865
other material. Most of them very small, maybe
anywhere from a pebble size to the size of this

01:26:48.865 --> 01:26:54.977
die or a little larger. And they're different than
the rock, they're a lighter material, and almost

01:26:54.977 --> 01:26:57.837
porous upon close look, as you take one and look
at it.

01:26:57.837 --> 01:27:05.153
LIAM: Scanlan and Keyleth, come up here, please.
Do you know what that is?

01:27:05.153 --> 01:27:07.366
MARISHA: What is it?

01:27:07.366 --> 01:27:13.436
MATT: You've seen this before, actually, in a
subterranean place once before, although it was a

01:27:13.436 --> 01:27:18.521
large field of it at the time. There are a number
of scattered shards of bone, just kind of

01:27:18.521 --> 01:27:23.986
scattered and cracked and broken across the floor.
Not a very thick mat, but just here and there,

01:27:23.986 --> 01:27:26.310
peppered throughout the walkway.

01:27:26.310 --> 01:27:30.420
MARISHA: These are dead things. This is bone.
Yeah.

01:27:30.420 --> 01:27:34.311
MATT: You also do notice, upon looking at a few of
them on the ground, now having the context, a lot

01:27:34.311 --> 01:27:38.633
of them look blackened, a lot of them look like
they've been charred, burnt.

01:27:38.633 --> 01:27:41.209
LAURA: Hey, Keyleth.

01:27:41.209 --> 01:27:42.346
MARISHA: Yeah?

01:27:42.346 --> 01:27:47.678
LAURA: When you did the scrying thing, how long
did it take to get down in the tunnels? Was it a

01:27:47.678 --> 01:27:50.204
lot of tunnels before you got to the laboratory?

01:27:50.204 --> 01:27:52.101
MARISHA: In terms of my vision?

01:27:52.101 --> 01:27:53.210
LAURA: Yeah.

01:27:53.210 --> 01:27:56.296
MATT: You don't know. It looked like you're at
this point, and then you're there.

01:27:56.296 --> 01:27:58.145
So you have no idea.

01:27:58.145 --> 01:28:00.198
LAURA: It's less than a mile down, I know.

01:28:00.198 --> 01:28:03.906
MARISHA: It kind of rushes past you really fast,
it's a little disorienting.

01:28:03.906 --> 01:28:06.245
LAURA: Okay.

01:28:06.245 --> 01:28:08.352
LIAM: No traps?

01:28:08.352 --> 01:28:10.332
MATT: No traps at the moment, no.

01:28:10.332 --> 01:28:12.192
LAURA: Should we all stealth?

01:28:12.192 --> 01:28:16.047
PATRICK: These are just here so that people step
on them and it makes noise?

01:28:16.047 --> 01:28:21.760
LIAM: It's a theory. We already stealthed.

01:28:21.760 --> 01:28:23.658
LAURA: I thought we had to reroll stealth.

01:28:23.658 --> 01:28:25.052
LIAM: Oh, I did.

01:28:25.052 --> 01:28:30.412
MARISHA: Can I do a-- this is some CSI shit.

01:28:30.412 --> 01:28:33.703
MATT: You guys are going stealth, right? All
right, so roll your stealth checks, please.

01:28:33.703 --> 01:28:35.396
TRAVIS: Plus ten?

01:28:35.396 --> 01:28:36.486
LAURA: 30.

01:28:36.486 --> 01:28:37.714
LIAM: 35.

01:28:37.714 --> 01:28:41.843
TALIESIN: 34. And then Scanlan...

01:28:41.843 --> 01:28:43.347
MARISHA: 30 total.

01:28:43.347 --> 01:28:44.505
TRAVIS: 28.

01:28:44.505 --> 01:28:45.682
LAURA: 25 for Pike.

01:28:45.682 --> 01:28:49.901
TRAVIS: No, sorry. Oh, 30.

01:28:49.901 --> 01:28:51.919
TALIESIN: 18 for Scanlan.

01:28:51.919 --> 01:28:54.278
PATRICK: 29 for me.

01:28:54.278 --> 01:29:01.079
MATT: Great, awesome. All right, so, as you guys
continue progressing down this curving tunnel, it

01:29:01.079 --> 01:29:05.266
goes into a very, very mild descent.

01:29:05.266 --> 01:29:15.430
MARISHA: Can I do-- I wanna do a quick check. This
is some Bones-type shit. Can I see if these bones

01:29:15.430 --> 01:29:21.204
were charred recently, or once again, if these
bones have been there for a long time? I know this

01:29:21.204 --> 01:29:23.476
is some weird carbon-dating shit.

01:29:23.476 --> 01:29:29.618
MATT: Make a nature check on this, actually. This
is your understanding at least of how fire against

01:29:29.618 --> 01:29:30.731
bone, which is--

01:29:30.731 --> 01:29:32.266
MARISHA: Ooh, that's good. 28.

01:29:32.266 --> 01:29:38.311
MATT: 28. Yeah, so understanding especially in the
Pyrah, and noticing the difference and just your

01:29:38.311 --> 01:29:43.887
experience of natural animals and creatures that
have been cooked to be eaten, and the effect of

01:29:43.887 --> 01:29:54.765
the fire on the bones that are left behind, this
bone charring is not as ancient as, say, the trees

01:29:54.765 --> 01:30:02.048
that have withered, but they're aren't-- they're
years old at the very least, if not longer.

01:30:02.048 --> 01:30:04.562
MARISHA: Years old, if not longer.

01:30:04.562 --> 01:30:08.494
MATT: Yeah, there's a layer of dust on these
bones, as well, that shows that at least they have

01:30:08.494 --> 01:30:10.375
been untouched for a short time.

01:30:10.375 --> 01:30:14.131
MARISHA: Okay. But wait, was Thordak here over a
year ago?

01:30:14.131 --> 01:30:15.813
TALIESIN: Could have been, yeah.

01:30:15.813 --> 01:30:22.710
LAURA: He was here for a long time before-- he was
here before he got the thing, right?

01:30:22.792 --> 01:30:30.425
MATT: Yeah. He made this his lair after avoiding
death from J'mon Sa Ord in Ank'harel, and then

01:30:30.425 --> 01:30:36.739
recuperated here, from what you know, and then
made this his domain for a while, and then pressed

01:30:36.739 --> 01:30:38.754
northward in Tal'Dorei, which is where--

01:30:38.754 --> 01:30:40.802
MARISHA: That's when Allura and her team
encountered him.

01:30:40.802 --> 01:30:46.445
MATT: Correct. That's when Thordak battled Raishan
and began the beginning of the formulation of the

01:30:46.445 --> 01:30:54.597
Conclave, that's when Thordak destroyed Byroden
and by proxy, their mother. That's when all of

01:30:54.597 --> 01:30:56.125
that went down.

01:30:56.125 --> 01:31:00.830
LIAM: While we're quiet here, in the dark, I pull
Pike over to the side. Pike!

01:31:00.830 --> 01:31:02.702
LAURA: Yes?

01:31:02.702 --> 01:31:11.541
LIAM: I have a bad-- will you take care of my
sister? You have that one thing that you do, I

01:31:11.541 --> 01:31:17.679
don't know what it's called, but if she falls
down, she gets back up again. Do you know what I'm

01:31:17.679 --> 01:31:18.740
talking about?

01:31:18.740 --> 01:31:25.259
LAURA: Is that the Death Ward? It's a thing. I
talk to Sarenrae and then she protects them for a

01:31:25.259 --> 01:31:26.850
little bit of time.

01:31:26.850 --> 01:31:29.733
LIAM: Could you do that to my sister now?

01:31:29.733 --> 01:31:32.191
LAURA: Feels a little selfish, but sure.

01:31:32.191 --> 01:31:34.101
(laughter)

01:31:34.101 --> 01:31:38.709
LIAM: I thought of it.

01:31:38.709 --> 01:31:42.955
LAURA: I mean, if you want me to do it.

01:31:42.955 --> 01:31:44.869
LIAM: I do, I do.

01:31:44.869 --> 01:31:55.628
LAURA: Sure, why not? I walk up to me. I guess
Pike will cast Death Ward on Vex.

01:31:55.628 --> 01:32:02.111
MATT: Okay. So that's a 4th-level spell off Pike,
and for the next eight hours,

01:32:02.111 --> 01:32:04.164
Vex is Death Warded.

01:32:04.164 --> 01:32:08.664
LIAM: When you're brought down to zero, you ping
up to one, is the math on that.

01:32:08.664 --> 01:32:14.541
MARISHA: It's kind of like buying Starbucks with
the company Amex.

01:32:14.541 --> 01:32:18.009
LAURA: Feels a little weird, not gonna lie.

01:32:18.009 --> 01:32:26.327
LIAM: It's just strategy, man. Game strategy.
Well, it's done, and my sister is a little safer

01:32:26.327 --> 01:32:28.883
than she was before, and y'all can go fuck
yourselves.

01:32:28.883 --> 01:32:32.339
MARISHA: So easy when you have the pin code.

01:32:32.339 --> 01:32:35.155
(laughter)

01:32:35.155 --> 01:32:39.100
LIAM: This one and this one on me.

01:32:39.100 --> 01:32:43.376
LAURA: Yeah, it's totally cool.

01:32:43.376 --> 01:32:51.345
LIAM: Out of character, Matt pooped out this new
feature to dying, and she's on her last fucking

01:32:51.345 --> 01:32:54.900
string, man. No regrets, move forward.

01:32:54.900 --> 01:32:58.542
MATT: To be fair, I'm still toying with it,
because it's one of the things that I'm adjusting

01:32:58.542 --> 01:32:59.736
as we go.

01:32:59.736 --> 01:33:02.003
LIAM: Well, you said it and the spell is cast.

01:33:02.003 --> 01:33:03.457
MATT: That's not true at all.

01:33:03.457 --> 01:33:05.221
MARISHA: You freaked everyone out, Matt.

01:33:05.221 --> 01:33:06.935
MATT: Oh, I can keep it if you want.

01:33:06.935 --> 01:33:08.872
MARISHA: No, don't worry about it.

01:33:08.872 --> 01:33:13.009
TALIESIN: You're literally wearing a creeper
shirt, you have to be careful what you say. God,

01:33:13.009 --> 01:33:14.384
every time.

01:33:14.384 --> 01:33:20.308
MATT: It's a rule that I'm working with. I may
have jumped the gun in releasing it at the time as

01:33:20.308 --> 01:33:24.497
I'm working on the campaign guide, but one of the
resurrection rules, I was deciding the DC, I think

01:33:24.497 --> 01:33:29.502
five per death is a bit intense, so I might adjust
it more to be a two. Just 'cause I was thinking,

01:33:29.502 --> 01:33:34.027
in a long-term campaign, your character might die
a lot more between levels one and 20. And then it

01:33:34.027 --> 01:33:36.582
gets a little insane. So I'm working on it.

01:33:36.582 --> 01:33:39.925
LIAM: Listen, I help my sister, okay?

01:33:39.925 --> 01:33:43.649
MATT: Mind you, she's still closer to death, but yes.

01:33:43.649 --> 01:33:46.634
MARISHA: Mind you, she's still closer to death.

01:33:46.634 --> 01:33:51.426
PATRICK: Just to ask a little bit, as we're going
down here, I don't know how everyone else is

01:33:51.426 --> 01:33:57.100
geared up, but I'm kind of vanilla human here, and
not that equipped to see in the dark.

01:33:57.100 --> 01:34:03.466
MATT: Yeah, in fact, currently Percival and Kerrek
are blind. Like, pitch-black blind.

01:34:03.466 --> 01:34:05.678
LAURA: Wait, light your little dagger up.

01:34:05.678 --> 01:34:07.154
MATT: All right--

01:34:07.154 --> 01:34:12.874
PATRICK: Actually, you probably just hear Kerrek
say, I am sorry, but at this point

01:34:12.874 --> 01:34:16.855
I can't see at all.

01:34:16.855 --> 01:34:23.392
LIAM: I'm always holding two, and one of them is,
I pull out the Flametongue Dagger, and I wave a

01:34:23.392 --> 01:34:24.464
fly away--

01:34:24.464 --> 01:34:25.856
LAURA: This gnat, this fucking gnat.

01:34:25.856 --> 01:34:31.577
LIAM: And I hold it so that Kerrek can see, and I
say, we might die, so try it one more time with

01:34:31.577 --> 01:34:37.601
me. Irish wristwatch. Just once more, before we
die.

01:34:37.601 --> 01:34:41.100
PATRICK: I dreamed about this last night.

01:34:41.100 --> 01:34:44.977
(laughter)

01:34:44.977 --> 01:34:47.097
TALIESIN: It's a tough one.

01:34:47.097 --> 01:34:50.471
PATRICK: Irish wr-- (laughs)

01:34:50.471 --> 01:34:52.779
(cheering)

01:34:52.779 --> 01:34:54.073
PATRICK: Irish wristwatch.

01:34:54.073 --> 01:34:55.866
(cheering)

01:34:55.866 --> 01:34:57.647
MATT: There you go. Well done.

01:34:57.647 --> 01:35:00.419
LIAM: I feel so much closer to you now. Let's
fucking do this.

01:35:00.419 --> 01:35:06.972
MATT: The dagger, which emits flame on it, is the
equivalent of a candle. He can see about 15 feet

01:35:06.972 --> 01:35:08.490
beyond you, and that's it.

01:35:08.490 --> 01:35:14.477
PATRICK: Well, actually, I'll say, as soon as I
say, are we okay with light? Or are we trying to

01:35:14.477 --> 01:35:16.722
keep it as dark as possible? Because--

01:35:16.722 --> 01:35:17.831
LIAM: Too late now.

01:35:17.831 --> 01:35:19.004
LAURA: A little bit of light.

01:35:19.004 --> 01:35:20.019
LIAM: There's a candle.

01:35:20.019 --> 01:35:25.035
MATT: There is now a flame licking the edge of the
blade that's being held aloft. So light is being

01:35:25.035 --> 01:35:27.229
shed now in the tunnel. Though not a lot.

01:35:27.229 --> 01:35:30.876
TRAVIS: You know, you could put that out and they
could just grab onto each one of our arms

01:35:30.876 --> 01:35:32.021
and move forward.

01:35:32.021 --> 01:35:33.524
MARISHA: Yeah, I go and find Percy.

01:35:33.524 --> 01:35:34.624
TALIESIN: Okay.

01:35:34.624 --> 01:35:35.948
MARISHA: And I link arms.

01:35:35.948 --> 01:35:37.817
TRAVIS: Oh, jeez. Hey, Kerr, you wanna cuddle?

01:35:37.817 --> 01:35:39.844
PATRICK: Actually, yes.

01:35:39.844 --> 01:35:42.297
(laughter)

01:35:42.297 --> 01:35:44.366
TRAVIS: Hey, Vax. Put that light out.

01:35:44.366 --> 01:35:49.834
MATT: All right, so Kerrek, there's a moment of
quiet and stillness in the darkness, as you feel

01:35:49.834 --> 01:35:57.539
the ground beneath you shift ever-so-slightly.
Heavy footfalls approaching you as suddenly a

01:35:57.539 --> 01:36:03.010
large, muscled, somewhat sweaty arm just curls
around the outside of your shoulders and pulls you

01:36:03.010 --> 01:36:05.964
close to Grog's torso.

01:36:05.964 --> 01:36:10.159
PATRICK: It is one of the most comforting things I
have ever experienced.

01:36:10.159 --> 01:36:12.919
(laughter)

01:36:12.919 --> 01:36:17.086
TRAVIS: I love it. I love it!

01:36:17.086 --> 01:36:21.113
LIAM: We're about to die.

01:36:21.113 --> 01:36:23.589
LAURA: No, no, no.

01:36:23.589 --> 01:36:27.436
MARISHA: Okay, I kinda guide Percy as we go
through.

01:36:27.436 --> 01:36:34.816
MATT: So you guys are making your way down this
slow grade beneath. Yes.

01:36:34.816 --> 01:36:38.332
MARISHA: Being stealthy as fuck.

01:36:38.332 --> 01:36:44.527
MATT: You make incremental checks as we go.
Eventually, as the grade continues downward, you

01:36:44.527 --> 01:36:51.154
begin to see the hallway open up ever-so-slightly,
and what was once just somewhat rough rock walls begin

01:36:51.154 --> 01:37:00.745
having slight shapes or details to them. It's
still hard to see. Darkvision is-- you still need

01:37:00.745 --> 01:37:04.209
a little light to make out fine details or things
at a distance, but it does help you at least make

01:37:04.209 --> 01:37:10.318
out the basic shapes and things ahead of you. You
see what appear to be small shelves or alcoves

01:37:10.318 --> 01:37:17.195
that are now beginning to show up every 20 or so
feet as you progress down. Little bits of rock

01:37:17.195 --> 01:37:24.301
that jut out that look like they were either
bolted in or crafted on top of it, and you see

01:37:24.301 --> 01:37:28.652
small, little cubbies, almost, little alcoves that
are put into the rock as well.

01:37:28.652 --> 01:37:31.519
LAURA: Hold your little dagger up to it, I want to
see what it is.

01:37:31.519 --> 01:37:32.714
LIAM: You're sure?

01:37:32.714 --> 01:37:33.906
LAURA: Yeah.

01:37:33.906 --> 01:37:37.375
MATT: Okay. Make a perception check.

01:37:37.375 --> 01:37:42.422
LIAM: That's pretty good. That is 29.

01:37:42.422 --> 01:37:48.518
MATT: Okay. You glance in the first one to your
immediate right, which is a small shelf outward,

01:37:48.518 --> 01:37:56.400
and you see what appear to be a number of
dust-covered-- a cluster of candles that have long

01:37:56.400 --> 01:38:01.631
burned and melted into dripping wax that pours
down the side of this alcove. That's it on that

01:38:01.631 --> 01:38:03.149
particular shelf.

01:38:03.149 --> 01:38:10.119
LAURA: Careful. Maybe keep it out, just keep an
eye out. It's hard to see down here.

01:38:10.119 --> 01:38:12.393
LIAM: I can look at these after.

01:38:12.393 --> 01:38:16.580
LAURA: No, I just, I mean for traps. Psh.

01:38:16.580 --> 01:38:20.463
MATT: Okay. So you're searching for traps now?

01:38:20.463 --> 01:38:21.913
LIAM: Constantly.

01:38:21.913 --> 01:38:25.239
MATT: Go ahead and make another investigation
check with disadvantage.

01:38:25.239 --> 01:38:29.264
LAURA: 'Cause it's dark. See? If you'd pulled your
dagger out, it wouldn't be so bad.

01:38:29.264 --> 01:38:32.157
LIAM: Good suggestion. Still at disadvantage?

01:38:32.157 --> 01:38:34.219
LAURA: If his dagger's out?

01:38:34.219 --> 01:38:41.058
MATT: Let me double-check, here. It's kind of a
frustratingly broken ability in some cases if it

01:38:41.058 --> 01:38:43.112
just is universally in here.

01:38:43.112 --> 01:38:50.156
LAURA: I'm gonna pull out the flying carpet.
(laughs) And I'm gonna walk over to--

01:38:50.156 --> 01:38:53.178
MATT: So you can see in dim light within 60 feet
of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness

01:38:53.178 --> 01:39:01.309
as if it were dim light, so you have about 15 feet
you can kind of see out in front of you in

01:39:01.309 --> 01:39:05.420
straight darkness. If you have your dagger out,
you can see pretty decently for 60 feet,

01:39:05.420 --> 01:39:07.153
is how it works.

01:39:07.153 --> 01:39:09.569
LIAM: But if it's gone, I can see 15 feet ahead?

01:39:09.569 --> 01:39:11.321
MATT: Kinda shitty in 15 feet.

01:39:11.321 --> 01:39:15.624
LAURA: I'm gonna give the--

01:39:15.718 --> 01:39:18.796
LIAM: So regular checks, if the dagger's out.

01:39:18.831 --> 01:39:22.264
MATT: For, at least, 60 feet for you.

01:39:22.264 --> 01:39:25.757
LIAM: And this is investigation. 18.

01:39:25.757 --> 01:39:33.146
MATT: Okay. Nothing seems to catch your attention.
As you continue pushing forward, you see one more

01:39:33.146 --> 01:39:35.323
of these shelves. Are you looking at each one as
you go?

01:39:35.323 --> 01:39:36.866
LIAM: Yeah, right now I am.

01:39:36.866 --> 01:39:39.382
MATT: Okay. As you glance past, another perception
check.

01:39:39.382 --> 01:39:43.496
LAURA: Hey, Grog. So I have this flying carpet...

01:39:43.496 --> 01:39:44.807
LIAM: 22.

01:39:44.807 --> 01:39:52.722
MATT: 22. Okay. You can see on the left shelf
appears to be a humanoid skull that's up on top,

01:39:52.722 --> 01:40:00.434
next to two more candles, one of them more melted
than the other, but the wax drips past. There's a

01:40:00.434 --> 01:40:05.976
shelf across the way on the opposite side that
appears to have a couple of small books that are

01:40:05.976 --> 01:40:09.446
put off to the side, and what looks like a small
wooden box.

01:40:09.446 --> 01:40:12.211
LIAM: Is the box trapped?

01:40:12.211 --> 01:40:15.261
MATT: Roll an investigation check.

01:40:15.261 --> 01:40:20.483
LIAM: That is a 22.

01:40:20.483 --> 01:40:23.344
MATT: Box does not appear trapped, from what you
can tell.

01:40:23.344 --> 01:40:25.657
LIAM: Nah, fuck it.

01:40:25.657 --> 01:40:27.751
TALIESIN: Put it in the Bag of Holding.

01:40:27.751 --> 01:40:29.061
LIAM: I don't.

01:40:29.061 --> 01:40:30.553
MATT: Okay, continue walking?

01:40:30.553 --> 01:40:32.227
LIAM: Mm-hm. Looking for traps.

01:40:32.227 --> 01:40:38.997
MATT: Okay. As you continue, keeping an eye out in
front of you, the next shelf you come across looks

01:40:38.997 --> 01:40:44.048
to have some sort of a mummified racoon-type
creature that is propped up.

01:40:44.048 --> 01:40:47.951
(laughter)

01:40:47.951 --> 01:40:54.262
MATT: Not taxidermied, by any means. It just looks
like it dried out in a sort of standing position,

01:40:54.262 --> 01:40:56.412
or at least is leaning against the wall of the
platform.

01:40:56.412 --> 01:41:00.024
MARISHA: Oh, like some weird Pompeii shit? Like he
died that way?

01:41:00.024 --> 01:41:01.928
MATT: Kind of. Literally just shriveled.

01:41:01.928 --> 01:41:06.118
LAURA: Grog, would you be able to use a flying
carpet in battle to get up to a dragon?

01:41:06.118 --> 01:41:08.655
TRAVIS: I have no idea.

01:41:08.655 --> 01:41:11.637
LAURA: It could be useful.

01:41:11.637 --> 01:41:14.244
MATT: Kerrek, do you have something you wanted to
say?

01:41:14.244 --> 01:41:19.229
PATRICK: Yeah, I'm just gonna-- blind as a bat as
I am, I'm gonna use Divine Sense to see if I can

01:41:19.229 --> 01:41:27.648
sense any undead, corrupt, fiend, it's kind of a
long list, but I do know corrupt

01:41:27.648 --> 01:41:29.671
was mentioned in there.

01:41:29.671 --> 01:41:38.645
TALIESIN: Also, Vax, what were the titles of those
books? Earpiece, listening to your vague

01:41:38.645 --> 01:41:40.298
description of things.

01:41:40.298 --> 01:41:50.792
LIAM: Thank you for retconning that. Yeah, we'll
ask him. Yeah, but I would've read them if I

01:41:50.792 --> 01:41:52.897
could've. I'm not Grog.

01:41:52.897 --> 01:41:56.395
TALIESIN: Grog would've read them, even if he just
made up words.

01:41:56.395 --> 01:42:04.927
MATT: You do sense that there is some sort of an
undead presence in your vicinity, Kerr, though you

01:42:04.927 --> 01:42:11.378
do not quite know what its nature is or its
direction. There is something undead near you.

01:42:11.378 --> 01:42:15.987
MARISHA: Oh, jeez. She didn't bring Thordak back,
did she? We're gonna have to

01:42:15.987 --> 01:42:17.197
fight an undead dragon.

01:42:17.197 --> 01:42:26.396
PATRICK: Do I get a sense of-- is it just, yes, it
is present, I don't get any sense of direction or

01:42:26.396 --> 01:42:32.395
intensity? I'm assuming this isn't my first rodeo.
Everybody bumps into skeletons

01:42:32.395 --> 01:42:33.947
early in their career.

01:42:33.947 --> 01:42:44.099
MATT: Correct. I would say it does not appear to
be any extreme-- yeah, it does not appear to be an

01:42:44.099 --> 01:42:49.562
extremely powerful undead presence. You can't tell
size or direction, by any means, but it's not like

01:42:49.562 --> 01:42:56.535
all of a sudden there's a lich ahead of you or
some massive arrival of Orcus. You just sense

01:42:56.535 --> 01:42:59.282
something around you that is an undead energy.

01:42:59.282 --> 01:43:01.599
LAURA: Around us? Like how close around us, can he
sense that?

01:43:01.599 --> 01:43:05.944
LIAM: I mean, this could be crypt shit on the
sides. I'm gonna focus a

01:43:05.944 --> 01:43:07.448
little more on the ground.

01:43:07.448 --> 01:43:09.373
MATT: Okay, do you guys all continue moving
forward?

01:43:09.373 --> 01:43:11.730
TALIESIN: I did ask about the books, the titles of
the books.

01:43:11.730 --> 01:43:13.631
LIAM: Yes, he asked me through the earpiece what
the books said.

01:43:13.631 --> 01:43:15.477
Could I read them when I saw them?

01:43:15.477 --> 01:43:17.227
MATT: What languages do you know?

01:43:17.227 --> 01:43:19.136
LIAM: Common, Elvish, and Abyssal?

01:43:19.136 --> 01:43:21.167
MATT: You do not know the title of the books.

01:43:21.167 --> 01:43:29.068
LIAM: Tighter Buns in 30 Days is the only title I
saw. Looking for traps.

01:43:29.068 --> 01:43:34.161
MATT: All right. Roll another investigation
check.

01:43:34.161 --> 01:43:37.264
LIAM: 25.

01:43:37.264 --> 01:43:48.233
MATT: 25, okay. You continue to push forward.
There is no trap set. You do look ahead and see

01:43:48.233 --> 01:43:54.697
what appears to be the pathway is now showing
stonework at times, almost like there are slabs,

01:43:54.697 --> 01:44:02.216
elements of a tunnel that was once better
constructed than what exists, but is either eroded

01:44:02.216 --> 01:44:06.478
away or elements of wall collapse have covered
what was once a

01:44:06.478 --> 01:44:09.210
very, very ancient form of architecture.

01:44:09.210 --> 01:44:14.207
LIAM: As a precaution, I'm going to, as much as I
can, stay to the stuff that looks natural or

01:44:14.207 --> 01:44:18.336
fucked-up and not civilized.

01:44:18.336 --> 01:44:27.563
PATRICK: Hold on, first, I'm sorry. I just found
my specific description. It does say I sense type

01:44:27.563 --> 01:44:29.307
and location.

01:44:29.307 --> 01:44:31.355
MATT: It does say that, I totally missed that.

01:44:31.355 --> 01:44:33.434
PATRICK: So long as it's not behind total cover.

01:44:33.434 --> 01:44:42.250
MATT: Got you. Okay. Then you sense there is
something. You know it's from one of the wall

01:44:42.250 --> 01:44:47.296
areas, but you cannot see, and your one single bit
of light source is ahead of you in the tunnel. But

01:44:47.296 --> 01:44:52.485
you do sense, at one point as you're walking, it
is to the left of you.

01:44:52.485 --> 01:45:00.099
PATRICK: Okay. I say, there is an unclean thing
here.

01:45:00.099 --> 01:45:03.589
TRAVIS: Well, fuck, I'm sorry, it's just not a
priority for me, all right?

01:45:03.589 --> 01:45:07.382
(laughter)

01:45:07.382 --> 01:45:10.616
TRAVIS: I mean, I put my arm down off his
shoulder, I'll grant him at least that.

01:45:10.806 --> 01:45:18.768
PATRICK: It's not you, Grog, there's some undead
thing here, and I say, it's off to the left.

01:45:18.768 --> 01:45:20.757
To my left.

01:45:20.757 --> 01:45:23.305
TALIESIN: The left hand of the tunnel.

01:45:23.305 --> 01:45:25.418
PATRICK: But I don't know what's around here.

01:45:25.418 --> 01:45:31.168
LAURA: Can we see anything on the walls that looks
like a door or anything?

01:45:31.168 --> 01:45:35.025
MATT: Are you stopping? 'Cause you two are moving
ahead of everyone else, so you guys are probably a

01:45:35.025 --> 01:45:37.567
good 15, 20 feet ahead. You want to move back with
them?

01:45:37.567 --> 01:45:38.748
LAURA: No, no.

01:45:38.748 --> 01:45:42.798
TRAVIS: Can I look to the left, just off him
saying that, because of the Belt of Dwarvenkind I

01:45:42.798 --> 01:45:44.515
have Darkvision?

01:45:44.515 --> 01:45:49.380
MATT: You do. You glance off to the left. You can
see upon that shelf unit there, there are the two

01:45:49.380 --> 01:45:52.656
candles and the singular skull set on the shelf.

01:45:52.656 --> 01:46:00.859
TRAVIS: I start to slowly make my way over to the
skull.

01:46:00.859 --> 01:46:02.398
MATT: Okay.

01:46:02.398 --> 01:46:03.724
LIAM: Gods damn it.

01:46:03.724 --> 01:46:06.999
MATT: Kerrek, you feel Grog slowly step in the
direction that you pointed out to him.

01:46:06.999 --> 01:46:08.719
TRAVIS: Is this the direction?

01:46:08.719 --> 01:46:10.973
PATRICK: Yes.

01:46:10.973 --> 01:46:12.856
TRAVIS: Are we getting warmer?

01:46:12.856 --> 01:46:22.718
PATRICK: Yes, it's over there. I'm not bringing my
hammer out, but my hammer's ready.

01:46:22.718 --> 01:46:24.991
TRAVIS: What does the skull look like?

01:46:24.991 --> 01:46:27.084
MATT: It looks like a human skull.

01:46:27.084 --> 01:46:30.106
TRAVIS: Anything shiny about it, or jewelled?

01:46:30.106 --> 01:46:35.565
MATT: No, it looks kind of dust-covered. You can
see what looks to be-- the bone itself appears to

01:46:35.565 --> 01:46:41.103
have a hint of blackened soot, or some sort of a
darker color to it,

01:46:41.103 --> 01:46:42.997
like it's been slightly singed.

01:46:42.997 --> 01:46:44.579
TRAVIS: Candles look like candles?

01:46:44.579 --> 01:46:46.556
MATT: Candles look like mostly melted candles.

01:46:46.556 --> 01:46:51.816
TRAVIS: Kerr, I hate to rain on your parade, but I
only see two candles and a human skull up here.

01:46:51.816 --> 01:47:02.030
PATRICK: Partial undead thing... do I know, again,
obviously nothing is trying to eat our faces off

01:47:02.030 --> 01:47:13.193
here, but can you turn an undead thing into just
like a watcher or a trap or a spy or a trigger?

01:47:13.193 --> 01:47:17.206
MATT: Make an intelligence check, or make a
religion check. Make a religion check.

01:47:17.206 --> 01:47:27.554
LAURA: Oh, it could be watching through the skull.
You're brilliant, Kerr! Fuck.

01:47:27.554 --> 01:47:30.869
PATRICK: You know, that's about a 12.

01:47:30.869 --> 01:47:31.948
MATT: Okay.

01:47:31.948 --> 01:47:33.515
PATRICK: Not my best.

01:47:33.515 --> 01:47:42.546
MATT: Best that you can understand is, undead
magic can raise dead, it can control dead. You

01:47:42.546 --> 01:47:54.027
have heard stories of undead or the use of them
being more situational, as opposed to just roaming

01:47:54.027 --> 01:47:58.488
as zombies, but that's as much as you can call off
the top of your head. It's been a while since

01:47:58.488 --> 01:48:01.812
you've been adventuring, so the specific stories
are a little too foggy.

01:48:01.812 --> 01:48:04.522
TALIESIN: Yeah, it could be a security camera.

01:48:04.522 --> 01:48:08.509
PATRICK: Actually, I say, if there's-- give me the
skull. And I'm just

01:48:08.509 --> 01:48:10.518
reaching out blindly in his direction.

01:48:10.518 --> 01:48:12.838
TRAVIS: All right. I grab the skull and hand it to
Kerr.

01:48:12.838 --> 01:48:14.180
MATT: Okay.

01:48:14.180 --> 01:48:19.443
PATRICK: And then I'll use Divine Sense again. Is
it this?

01:48:19.443 --> 01:48:29.305
MATT: It is, the skull is the source of the undead
energy. It is not currently moving or reacting or

01:48:29.305 --> 01:48:36.539
having any sort of reaction to being held by you.

01:48:36.539 --> 01:48:39.829
PATRICK: I say, anybody mind if I wreck this
thing?

01:48:39.829 --> 01:48:44.590
TRAVIS: No, I do not mind at all, thank god
there's someone else in this world

01:48:44.590 --> 01:48:46.290
with my sort of thinking.

01:48:46.290 --> 01:48:49.087
LIAM: What are you doing back there?

01:48:49.087 --> 01:48:58.442
TRAVIS: Hold on. I grab my earring, and I say,
Kerr found a human skull that has some undead

01:48:58.442 --> 01:49:00.876
vibes vibrating out of it.

01:49:00.876 --> 01:49:02.192
LAURA: Okay.

01:49:02.192 --> 01:49:07.558
TRAVIS: But it's not doing anything. Do you mind
if we destroy it?

01:49:07.558 --> 01:49:09.424
LIAM: He's already holding it?

01:49:09.424 --> 01:49:10.441
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:49:10.441 --> 01:49:15.823
LIAM: Well, I mean, if anything was gonna happen,
we're probably fucked already, so I don't know.

01:49:15.823 --> 01:49:17.427
TALIESIN: Actually, where's Kima?

01:49:17.427 --> 01:49:22.446
MATT: That's a good point. What is your guys'
marching order, by the way? I know the twins are

01:49:22.446 --> 01:49:23.846
in the front.

01:49:23.846 --> 01:49:30.267
TALIESIN: Then I think it's you and Kerr, and then
me and--

01:49:30.267 --> 01:49:36.950
MATT: Grog and Kerr, Keyleth and Percy--

01:49:36.950 --> 01:49:40.622
TALIESIN: Ash and Scanlan.

01:49:40.622 --> 01:49:49.751
MATT: Ash and Scanlan after that. And then we
have-- do you have Trinket out of the necklace,

01:49:49.751 --> 01:49:56.421
right? Then probably Kima and Allura back with
Trinket in the back. So they're kind of holding up

01:49:56.421 --> 01:49:58.516
the rear and keeping an eye out behind as they
go.

01:49:58.516 --> 01:50:00.220
TALIESIN: I think destroying it will trigger it.

01:50:00.220 --> 01:50:04.992
LIAM: I'm kind of for leaving things alone as we
go through here, Percival.

01:50:04.992 --> 01:50:07.653
TRAVIS: I mean, we can leave it alone.

01:50:07.653 --> 01:50:12.203
LAURA: I could do Sacred Flame on it, and it would
do radiant damage to it.

01:50:12.203 --> 01:50:17.835
MARISHA: What if we turn and just face the skull
so it's looking into the corner.

01:50:17.835 --> 01:50:19.609
LAURA: Sure.

01:50:19.609 --> 01:50:21.609
MARISHA: So it's not looking at us.

01:50:21.609 --> 01:50:25.629
LIAM: I think dicking with it in the first place
might have already ruined us, but yeah, let's just

01:50:25.629 --> 01:50:27.282
set it down, turn it around.

01:50:27.282 --> 01:50:32.332
TRAVIS: Hey, Kerr, they're worried we're gonna
kill ourselves. Can you just put it back, but face

01:50:32.332 --> 01:50:34.343
it towards the wall like it's in time out?

01:50:34.343 --> 01:50:40.252
PATRICK: Sure. If I've got a spare sack, I'll
stuff it in the sack and

01:50:40.252 --> 01:50:41.659
point it towards the wall.

01:50:41.659 --> 01:50:48.300
MATT: Okay. So you pull out the extra, kind of a
heavy burlap sack, you throw the skull in there,

01:50:48.300 --> 01:50:51.395
tie it taut, and set it back up on the shelf,
facing away from where you're standing.

01:50:51.395 --> 01:50:53.223
TALIESIN: Do not underestimate the power of
burlap.

01:50:53.223 --> 01:50:57.740
LAURA: We should've come down in the tunnel
wearing pantyhose on our heads so Raishan wouldn't

01:50:57.740 --> 01:50:59.015
have known.

01:50:59.015 --> 01:51:00.837
TALIESIN: Just thought it was a college prank?

01:51:00.837 --> 01:51:04.127
MARISHA: Oh man, we should totally invest in those
little pantyhose eggs.

01:51:04.127 --> 01:51:07.400
LIAM: Delta lambda again, sneaking in, aw.

01:51:07.400 --> 01:51:09.230
MATT: Every time!

01:51:09.230 --> 01:51:12.039
LIAM: I don't know enough about that to say that
correctly, either.

01:51:12.039 --> 01:51:18.181
MATT: Continuing onward, into the next length of
the tunnel, about another 50 feet or so, there

01:51:18.181 --> 01:51:27.655
is-- the room opens up, and you can see that
stonework eventually takes the entire floor, and

01:51:27.655 --> 01:51:34.964
the chamber opens up into what looks to be almost
like a hexagonal-shaped chamber that ends at a

01:51:34.964 --> 01:51:42.000
large iron door. It fills the entirety of the
chamber, and it seals off any progression from

01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:44.828
that point. Make a perception check.

01:51:44.828 --> 01:51:47.144
TRAVIS: Vex-agonal shaped.

01:51:47.144 --> 01:51:50.535
LAURA: Vex-agonal? Should I make a perception
check, too, since I'm near it?

01:51:50.535 --> 01:51:51.914
MATT: Sure.

01:51:51.914 --> 01:51:53.393
LIAM: 22.

01:51:53.393 --> 01:51:57.036
LAURA: Oh god, that was almost a one. But it's
not, it was a 15.

01:51:57.036 --> 01:52:06.528
MATT: Okay. So 15 total? Okay. As you glance, you
can see at the center of this chamber there looks

01:52:06.528 --> 01:52:18.101
to be-- let's see here. Okay, yeah. There stands a
pillar of dark green marble, about ten feet, 15

01:52:18.101 --> 01:52:24.247
feet away from where the iron door is, and what
looks to be a roughly forged bowl of iron that is

01:52:24.247 --> 01:52:29.026
imperfect and is bolted to the top of this
pillar.

01:52:29.026 --> 01:52:32.484
LIAM: On the top or out the side of the top?

01:52:32.484 --> 01:52:39.465
MATT: Resting on top of it, and it's about maybe
five, six feet up, and there is a platform that

01:52:39.465 --> 01:52:44.234
leads up to it. So maybe if you were standing on
the little dais around it, it'd be about

01:52:44.234 --> 01:52:45.929
chest-height to you.

01:52:45.929 --> 01:52:47.953
LIAM: How tall is this chamber?

01:52:47.953 --> 01:52:56.486
MATT: The chamber's whole height would be about 25
feet. You also see, off to the right, what appears

01:52:56.486 --> 01:53:03.954
to be another shelf that contains a very, very
large leather-bound tome and what looks to be a

01:53:03.954 --> 01:53:10.699
cold iron brazier that is unburnt but has a bunch
of dried tinder in it.

01:53:10.699 --> 01:53:14.798
LAURA: Oh, god.

01:53:14.798 --> 01:53:16.429
LIAM: Oh, come here, come here.

01:53:16.429 --> 01:53:17.703
LAURA: What?

01:53:17.703 --> 01:53:22.823
LIAM: There's some shit, there's some ingredients
in that, ready to go.

01:53:22.823 --> 01:53:25.320
LAURA: There's ingredients?

01:53:25.320 --> 01:53:29.187
LIAM: Yeah, there's something in that brazier over
there that she hasn't burned yet.

01:53:29.187 --> 01:53:33.343
TALIESIN: Can I get a little light in here, just
for a second?

01:53:33.343 --> 01:53:34.641
LIAM: I'm holding.

01:53:34.641 --> 01:53:40.463
MATT: You have a tiny bit of candlelight. You can
see about ten, 15 feet around Vax.

01:53:40.463 --> 01:53:44.463
TALIESIN: Okay, so I can't see the mechanism on
the door.

01:53:44.463 --> 01:53:47.581
MATT: You do not even know there's a door there.

01:53:47.581 --> 01:53:50.512
TALIESIN: Okay, that's fair. For the best, it
would just scare me.

01:53:50.512 --> 01:53:52.678
LAURA: I mean, would it be helpful if everyone
could see?

01:53:52.678 --> 01:53:55.029
TALIESIN: Take a look around.

01:53:55.029 --> 01:54:01.519
MARISHA: No one else is in this room, yeah? Can
the half-elves with Darkvision do a little--

01:54:01.519 --> 01:54:03.467
MATT: Make perception checks.

01:54:03.467 --> 01:54:08.368
LIAM: I'll do that, and I'm also going to do
Divine Sense here.

01:54:08.368 --> 01:54:14.851
MARISHA: Don't fuck me, Gil. Oh, thanks, Gil!
That's not bad! Perception, right? 26.

01:54:14.851 --> 01:54:16.499
TRAVIS: 16.

01:54:16.499 --> 01:54:17.651
LIAM: 22.

01:54:17.651 --> 01:54:21.705
MATT: There does not appear to be anybody else in
this chamber with you, and from your Divine Sense,

01:54:21.705 --> 01:54:26.885
you do not sense any undead within 60 feet of you
right now.

01:54:26.885 --> 01:54:28.826
LIAM: There's no undead dragons walking around.

01:54:28.826 --> 01:54:31.131
TRAVIS: Can I look for invisible dragons? No, I'm
kidding.

01:54:31.131 --> 01:54:33.929
TALIESIN: You see seven.

01:54:33.929 --> 01:54:37.042
LAURA: So, Light? Should we light it up?

01:54:37.042 --> 01:54:42.453
MATT: He doesn't sense any undead within 60 feet,
that's the range of it.

01:54:42.453 --> 01:54:47.553
LIAM: Right. How far from the gate to the far side
of the room, is the first question.

01:54:47.553 --> 01:54:50.749
MATT: The doorway, you mean?

01:54:50.749 --> 01:54:54.947
LIAM: I'm at a gate that blocks us from going in,
is that correct?

01:54:54.947 --> 01:54:58.084
MATT: No, you're entering this chamber, then on
the opposite side of the room there is a larger

01:54:58.084 --> 01:55:02.760
door that prevents you from progressing beyond the
doorway. In between you and that door, there is

01:55:02.760 --> 01:55:08.574
that raised platform, the pillar, and the iron
bowl, and then to the right and against the wall,

01:55:08.574 --> 01:55:13.877
there is the brazier and the shelf with the
singular tome.

01:55:13.877 --> 01:55:21.007
LAURA: Does it look like-- when we entered the
chamber, does it look like a door would come down

01:55:21.007 --> 01:55:23.460
or something when it opened up into the chamber?

01:55:23.460 --> 01:55:27.696
LIAM: Right, is there a gap, like a crack that
something could slide down out of right above

01:55:27.696 --> 01:55:29.151
where we are?

01:55:29.151 --> 01:55:34.632
MATT: Glancing up, based on your perception rolls,
you don't see anything that would dictate any sort

01:55:34.632 --> 01:55:36.866
of exit or entranceway from the ceiling.

01:55:36.866 --> 01:55:41.533
LIAM: And in addition to everything we see, do we
see levers, do we see panels, do we see anything

01:55:41.533 --> 01:55:43.313
on the walls in this room?

01:55:43.313 --> 01:55:51.039
MATT: No, there's standard stone, old stone
masonry. You can see chunks that have broken off

01:55:51.039 --> 01:55:56.615
and just fallen over the years, there's a couple
small cave-in areas where it looks like rocks have

01:55:56.615 --> 01:56:03.822
just tumbled in as the general shifting of the
island has caused some elements to fall loose and

01:56:03.822 --> 01:56:05.101
tumble in.

01:56:05.101 --> 01:56:07.727
MARISHA: Keyleth is gonna go ahead and light up
her fire hands.

01:56:07.727 --> 01:56:16.017
MATT: Okay. That gives a bigger radius. Comparable
torchlight to Keyleth, and now Kerrek and

01:56:16.017 --> 01:56:22.952
Percival, you guys can both have a much better
view of the room. You can see now this iron bowl

01:56:22.952 --> 01:56:28.971
on top of this pillar in the center. You can just
make out the large iron wall or door on the

01:56:28.971 --> 01:56:33.200
opposite side, and a little bit of the brazier and
the tome.

01:56:33.200 --> 01:56:41.236
TALIESIN: I've built a fire-lock mechanism for a
door before. Would I recognize this as being a set

01:56:41.236 --> 01:56:45.368
a fire in the bowl and that might open the door?

01:56:45.368 --> 01:56:47.024
MATT: Make an intelligence check.

01:56:47.024 --> 01:56:49.904
TALIESIN: I built one for the Raven Queen temple.

01:56:49.904 --> 01:56:51.436
MARISHA: Go Percy, go Percy, go.

01:56:51.436 --> 01:56:57.490
TALIESIN: Intelligence check? That's, with my new
intelligence level, that's a 19.

01:56:57.490 --> 01:57:03.636
MATT: 19. Best you can glance here, I mean, it's
possible, but this--

01:57:03.636 --> 01:57:05.803
TALIESIN: It's magic.

01:57:05.803 --> 01:57:10.181
MATT: You don't know. The room itself is ancient,
and the construction, there is nothing that

01:57:10.181 --> 01:57:12.323
appears to be mechanically attached.

01:57:12.323 --> 01:57:14.362
TALIESIN: So if it did, it would be magical. If
that was--

01:57:14.362 --> 01:57:22.853
MATT: Yeah, there's no chain, pulley system
visible at all. Where the door hits the seam of

01:57:22.853 --> 01:57:25.724
the room, it looks very smooth.

01:57:25.724 --> 01:57:31.162
LAURA: Can I go look in the bowl, the bowl in the
middle of the room, and just look and see if

01:57:31.162 --> 01:57:32.398
there's a residue of anything in it?

01:57:32.398 --> 01:57:36.000
MATT: Sure, you can make an investigation check.

01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:41.919
PATRICK: Can I just say that when the lights came
up, Kerr kind of, he'd been leaning into Grog

01:57:41.919 --> 01:57:49.277
maybe more than was entirely appropriate. So he
kind of stood up a little better on his own to get

01:57:49.277 --> 01:57:51.940
out of it.

01:57:51.940 --> 01:57:53.764
MATT: Right. (clears throat)

01:57:53.764 --> 01:57:55.921
LIAM: Luckily, no one saw you, because of that
robe.

01:57:55.921 --> 01:57:57.509
LAURA: 26.

01:57:57.509 --> 01:58:06.195
MATT: As you look down into the bowl, you can make
out what looks to be a very, very faint long-dried

01:58:06.195 --> 01:58:10.703
residue just at the very, very bottom of it. Some
sort of a liquid that was once in there that has

01:58:10.703 --> 01:58:16.458
since dried up entirely and left this very, very
faint, just a slight shift in texture other than

01:58:16.458 --> 01:58:17.912
the hammered iron.

01:58:17.912 --> 01:58:20.685
LAURA: No color change or anything on it?

01:58:20.685 --> 01:58:24.008
MATT: Not that you can really tell, no. You're
just looking into this dark bowl with a little bit

01:58:24.008 --> 01:58:25.162
of light source.

01:58:25.162 --> 01:58:26.637
LAURA: Well, I don't actually touch it.

01:58:26.637 --> 01:58:31.708
TALIESIN: Do you have something sharp to just
scrape some off?

01:58:31.708 --> 01:58:35.041
LIAM: While she's doing that, I'm just going to
quietly extend my wings now.

01:58:35.041 --> 01:58:37.830
MATT: Your wings.

01:58:37.830 --> 01:58:41.133
LAURA: Oh yeah, I get out a lockpick and scrape it
to see if I can--

01:58:41.133 --> 01:58:42.746
PATRICK: Holy shit!

01:58:42.746 --> 01:58:44.972
(laughter)

01:58:44.972 --> 01:58:46.821
LIAM: They're pretty cool, aren't they.

01:58:46.821 --> 01:58:48.624
LAURA: They take up a lot of room, though, so.

01:58:48.624 --> 01:58:51.675
LIAM: No, they don't. They go out and they slam
back into my back.

01:58:51.675 --> 01:58:54.476
MATT: Yeah, Kerrek, as they're having this
conversation, you're looking, watching as this

01:58:54.476 --> 01:59:00.361
small half-elf rogue that you've had a few
encounters with suddenly just sends this pair of

01:59:00.361 --> 01:59:06.692
large jet-black raven-like wings that fire from
his shoulderblades and slowly fold behind him.

01:59:06.692 --> 01:59:09.042
TALIESIN: They don't work. He just does that to be
an asshole.

01:59:09.042 --> 01:59:14.224
MARISHA: It's all a cosplay prop. That's all it
is.

01:59:14.224 --> 01:59:18.682
PATRICK: Strikes a bit of a figure, though,
doesn't he?

01:59:18.682 --> 01:59:20.023
TALIESIN: No, it's very attractive.

01:59:20.023 --> 01:59:23.879
LIAM: I heard Percival say that.

01:59:23.879 --> 01:59:26.920
LAURA: Scratch-scratch, scrape-scrape.

01:59:26.920 --> 01:59:28.176
MATT: You're scraping the--

01:59:28.176 --> 01:59:30.112
LAURA: Yeah, just to see what the residue is.

01:59:30.112 --> 01:59:35.027
MATT: Okay, it scrapes up, it creates a small,
almost like a dried powder-type substance.

01:59:35.027 --> 01:59:37.699
LAURA: What color is it?

01:59:37.699 --> 01:59:39.377
MATT: It's like a dark burgundy.

01:59:39.377 --> 01:59:41.066
LAURA: This is fucking blood.

01:59:41.066 --> 01:59:42.475
TALIESIN: Can I taste it?

01:59:42.475 --> 01:59:45.283
MATT: Yeah, taste it, has kind of an iron-like
taste.

01:59:45.283 --> 01:59:47.512
MARISHA: Oh, it's so blood. Oh, you're so right.

01:59:47.512 --> 01:59:50.165
LAURA: Maybe we should just bleed into this bowl
and the door will open.

01:59:50.165 --> 01:59:51.495
TALIESIN: Tempting.

01:59:51.495 --> 01:59:52.984
TRAVIS: I can do that.

01:59:52.984 --> 01:59:54.194
LAURA: Necromancy?

01:59:54.194 --> 01:59:57.354
MARISHA: I think that's the word, yeah.

01:59:57.354 --> 02:00:02.441
TALIESIN: Do we recognize the architecture of the
door, and I also want to take a look at that book.

02:00:02.441 --> 02:00:06.221
What is the book's language, what does it look
like? I'm not picking it up yet, I'm just looking

02:00:06.221 --> 02:00:07.892
at it on the shelf.

02:00:07.892 --> 02:00:13.679
MATT: The leather tome which is currently leaning
up against it has no text on the cover and no text

02:00:13.679 --> 02:00:17.613
on the spine, but it is big. It's about that big.
So it's like a tome.

02:00:17.613 --> 02:00:19.361
TRAVIS: Is it made of skin?

02:00:19.361 --> 02:00:22.714
MATT: Grog, do you want to go over and check it
out?

02:00:22.714 --> 02:00:24.038
TRAVIS: Yes.

02:00:24.038 --> 02:00:29.400
MATT: Okay. It appears to be a thick leather. It's
hard to tell in this light if it was made from

02:00:29.400 --> 02:00:33.033
tanned hide or tanned flesh, but it is old.

02:00:33.033 --> 02:00:38.275
LIAM: As we're watching Grog, I just lean over and
say, you know, you are criticizing the size of my

02:00:38.275 --> 02:00:43.938
wings, you are walking around with a Persian rug,
a broom, and a longbow strapped to your back.

02:00:43.938 --> 02:00:46.918
LAURA: I tried to give this rug to someone else,
but Grog didn't want to take it.

02:00:46.918 --> 02:00:54.041
MARISHA: And then I come up and I say, can I pet
your wings? I've never pet them before.

02:00:54.041 --> 02:00:59.633
LAURA: There's things going on in this room.

02:00:59.633 --> 02:01:06.260
MATT: You can hear this heavy sigh from Allura
behind you, she's like, (sighs). "I'm just, this

02:01:06.260 --> 02:01:08.902
"is my first time actually adventuring with you."

02:01:08.902 --> 02:01:13.057
MARISHA: This is our method.

02:01:13.057 --> 02:01:16.277
TALIESIN: We're going to see if we put the PDA in
the bowl, see if that'll--

02:01:16.277 --> 02:01:19.797
MATT: "Oh, don't get me wrong, it just reminds me
of my early days as an adventurer, and I forgot

02:01:19.797 --> 02:01:21.845
"just how ridiculous we were, so."

02:01:21.845 --> 02:01:24.304
TRAVIS: Is there still tinder under the--

02:01:24.304 --> 02:01:31.041
MATT: Yeah, there's the iron brazier and there's a
lot of dried-- inside there, yeah.

02:01:31.041 --> 02:01:35.185
TALIESIN: Well, we do have samples of blood, in
theory, in the Bag of Holding.

02:01:35.185 --> 02:01:39.959
LAURA: We've got dragon blood. I'm gonna get out a
vial of dragon blood.

02:01:39.959 --> 02:01:41.604
(feedback sound)

02:01:41.604 --> 02:01:43.042
LIAM: Oh, jeez.

02:01:43.042 --> 02:01:44.292
TALIESIN: You've caused a feedback loop.

02:01:44.292 --> 02:01:45.624
LIAM: She's coming!

02:01:45.624 --> 02:01:47.551
MARISHA: We are Spinal Tap!

02:01:47.551 --> 02:01:49.709
LAURA: What is it?

02:01:49.709 --> 02:01:51.243
MATT: I don't know.

02:01:51.243 --> 02:01:53.375
LAURA: I put the dragon blood away.

02:01:53.375 --> 02:01:56.970
LIAM: Are there any holes in the ceiling I can see
like there were in the last cave?

02:01:56.970 --> 02:01:58.653
MARISHA: I have this ringing in my ear.

02:01:58.653 --> 02:02:02.270
MATT: There do not appear to be holes in the
ceiling, no.

02:02:02.270 --> 02:02:07.373
LAURA: What should I do? Wait, I've also got other
kinds of blood, let me see what kinds of blood

02:02:07.373 --> 02:02:08.288
I've got.

02:02:08.288 --> 02:02:09.814
TALIESIN: Is the book trapped?

02:02:09.814 --> 02:02:17.391
LIAM: 24.

02:02:17.391 --> 02:02:23.300
MATT: 24? Looking at the book, are you taking it
off the shelf or are you--

02:02:23.300 --> 02:02:25.190
LIAM: No, I'm looking at it, man.

02:02:25.190 --> 02:02:29.022
MATT: Looking at it. It looks like it is just
resting against the wall. The shelf unit is not

02:02:29.022 --> 02:02:33.059
trapped, the book itself does not appear to have
any sort of connection to the wall, you can see

02:02:33.059 --> 02:02:38.686
the pages themselves are weathered, old, stained,
but intact.

02:02:38.686 --> 02:02:42.536
LIAM: Is anyone near me?

02:02:42.536 --> 02:02:46.672
MATT: Currently, Percival's a step or two behind
you.

02:02:46.672 --> 02:02:48.459
TALIESIN: I'm holding onto the wing.

02:02:48.459 --> 02:02:58.294
LIAM: I push back slowly with my wings. Just get
15, 20 behind me. I'm gonna bring it to you. I'm

02:02:58.294 --> 02:03:01.679
gonna try to take this fucking book off, okay? If
I'm going to go down, I don't want you to go down

02:03:01.679 --> 02:03:03.351
as well, all right?

02:03:03.351 --> 02:03:05.488
TRAVIS: Are you about to die right now?

02:03:05.488 --> 02:03:07.831
MARISHA: Don't, Ve-- Vax.

02:03:07.831 --> 02:03:12.097
(laughter)

02:03:12.097 --> 02:03:17.552
MARISHA: I love you! I know your name on my good
days.

02:03:17.552 --> 02:03:20.250
TRAVIS: (chanting) Grab it, grab it, grab it.

02:03:20.250 --> 02:03:29.439
LIAM: I get back about ten feet and I take my wing
and I scootch it--

02:03:29.439 --> 02:03:31.126
LAURA: Oh wait, you know what?

02:03:31.126 --> 02:03:36.905
MATT: As you're saying this, the book (impact) and
hits the ground. It scatters open.

02:03:36.905 --> 02:03:42.808
LIAM: Oh, it's open? Percival, come here. And I
light it up, just to look

02:03:42.808 --> 02:03:44.335
at the pages that are there.

02:03:44.335 --> 02:03:49.776
MATT: So you take the dagger and you place it over
there. You don't recognize the text. And you try

02:03:49.776 --> 02:03:53.106
and focus on it, too, and you don't recognize it,
either. It's like the more you look at the text,

02:03:53.106 --> 02:03:59.478
the text gets smaller and smaller and smaller
until it's microscopic. It just looks like a mess

02:03:59.478 --> 02:04:03.896
of symbols and details. It's weird, it's almost
like as you get closer, the perspective keeps

02:04:03.896 --> 02:04:07.863
shifting away from you, to where you cannot
actually make out or read the text in the book.

02:04:07.863 --> 02:04:09.173
TRAVIS: How's it feel?

02:04:09.173 --> 02:04:16.104
TALIESIN: I'm gonna flip gently, with a gloved
hand, flip through a couple pages just to see if

02:04:16.104 --> 02:04:17.932
it's text, text, text, or if there's any--

02:04:17.932 --> 02:04:23.075
MATT: As of right now, it looks like there's just
text. As you go through, every page seems to have

02:04:23.075 --> 02:04:28.219
the same sort of reaction, where as your eyes try
and focus in the low light, the text just gets

02:04:28.219 --> 02:04:30.510
smaller and smaller and just avoid comprehension.

02:04:30.510 --> 02:04:33.840
TALIESIN: I'm going to flip to the front really
quickly and see if there's a title.

02:04:33.840 --> 02:04:38.856
MATT: There is a title, and as you look at it, the
title itself seems to be blurred and obscured and

02:04:38.856 --> 02:04:42.785
begins to shrink as well. It's like trying to put
on a pair of reading glasses that won't focus.

02:04:42.785 --> 02:04:44.399
TALIESIN: I know that feeling.

02:04:44.399 --> 02:04:45.953
LIAM: Allura, will you have a look at this?

02:04:45.953 --> 02:04:47.668
MATT: She comes over. Kerr, what are you doing?

02:04:47.668 --> 02:04:57.422
PATRICK: I'll actually bring out my hammer and,
assuming that I can get close to the book as well,

02:04:57.422 --> 02:05:00.140
it does the same thing for me?

02:05:00.140 --> 02:05:04.912
MATT: As you get close and look, yes, the same
thing, your vision doesn't seem to focus on the

02:05:04.912 --> 02:05:06.768
text, the pages seem to just hide from--

02:05:06.768 --> 02:05:09.478
PATRICK: I was going to say, are we okay with more
light?

02:05:09.478 --> 02:05:12.256
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:05:12.256 --> 02:05:17.937
PATRICK: Kind of looking around. Okay. Then I'll
effectively, I'll activate the hammer.

02:05:17.937 --> 02:05:21.947
MATT: Okay. As he pulls his warhammer in front of
him, you watch as the head of it,

02:05:21.947 --> 02:05:24.425
the spike in the back--

02:05:24.425 --> 02:05:32.629
PATRICK: There is no head, it's just kind of a bar
of iron that he has until he holds it up, and then

02:05:32.629 --> 02:05:39.928
the head of it comes into being as an artifact of
radiant light.

02:05:39.928 --> 02:05:41.476
MARISHA: Oh, that's cool!

02:05:41.476 --> 02:05:48.161
MATT: So what would've been the back of the
hammer, the front of it is, like you said, missing

02:05:48.161 --> 02:05:55.069
entirely, and it just blazes forth with radiant
energy, like a giant, glowing metallic

02:05:55.069 --> 02:05:56.669
end of a weapon.

02:05:56.669 --> 02:06:00.505
PATRICK: I'd also like to think that it makes a
noise like a lightsaber, but that's just--

02:06:00.505 --> 02:06:10.077
MATT: (lightsaber sound) as it happens. The room
is now much brighter, and you can see the details

02:06:10.077 --> 02:06:18.935
of the stonework around you. The mustiness seems
to almost back away instinctually from the radiant

02:06:18.935 --> 02:06:21.148
light itself, almost warms the air in its
vicinity.

02:06:21.148 --> 02:06:23.784
MARISHA: It smells like strawberries!

02:06:23.784 --> 02:06:25.234
TALIESIN: That's me.

02:06:25.234 --> 02:06:31.659
MATT: It's very weird strawberries, probably. As
the light hits the pages, the pages go almost

02:06:31.659 --> 02:06:37.373
blank. The text just shrinks away to the point
where it looks like there's just tiny, tiny dots.

02:06:37.373 --> 02:06:39.097
TALIESIN: I think I've solved this!

02:06:39.097 --> 02:06:40.360
LAURA: What?

02:06:40.360 --> 02:06:45.358
TALIESIN: Let's extinguish all the lights, and
someone with low-light vision has to read it.

02:06:45.358 --> 02:06:47.571
LAURA: Okay. Grog.

02:06:47.571 --> 02:06:48.577
TRAVIS: Yeah?

02:06:48.577 --> 02:06:52.375
TALIESIN: No. That's not funny.

02:06:52.375 --> 02:06:55.109
LAURA: I mean, sure, yeah, extinguish all the
lights. I wanna go and see if I can read it.

02:06:55.109 --> 02:06:58.072
PATRICK: Switch off the hammer.

02:06:58.072 --> 02:07:05.485
MATT: Okay. The head of the warhammer flickers
out, leaving just the handle behind. You go ahead

02:07:05.485 --> 02:07:09.137
and look at it, and the text is more legible there
on the page,

02:07:09.137 --> 02:07:11.203
but it's still blurred to your vision.

02:07:11.203 --> 02:07:14.584
LAURA: I think I need glasses. It's blurry.

02:07:14.584 --> 02:07:17.132
TALIESIN: Do we have anybody with perfect
nightvision?

02:07:17.132 --> 02:07:19.094
MARISHA: Perfect nightvision?

02:07:19.094 --> 02:07:21.055
PATRICK: 20-20 nightvision?

02:07:21.055 --> 02:07:23.845
TALIESIN: Well, I can't see a thing.

02:07:23.845 --> 02:07:26.476
MARISHA: Nothing, for you?

02:07:26.476 --> 02:07:28.282
LAURA: Nah, it's blurry.

02:07:28.282 --> 02:07:34.336
MARISHA: Still blurry? I look over Vex's shoulder.
Maybe, I don't know, anything? I know Primordial.

02:07:34.336 --> 02:07:37.222
LIAM: Might be that we're too nice.

02:07:37.222 --> 02:07:42.682
TRAVIS: Maybe if you put something in the pot and
set it on fire, by that light, you'll--

02:07:42.682 --> 02:07:44.564
MARISHA: Scanlan goes up and looks at it.

02:07:44.564 --> 02:07:46.564
TALIESIN: Begrudgingly.

02:07:46.564 --> 02:07:54.221
MATT: Scanlan glances over. "It's fine to me. I
don't know what your problem was.

02:07:54.221 --> 02:07:58.129
"No, I have no idea what's on the pages, 
I'm just messing with you."

02:07:58.129 --> 02:07:59.469
(groaning)

02:07:59.469 --> 02:08:00.698
MATT: "Sorry, guys!"

02:08:00.698 --> 02:08:02.278
MARISHA: I thought we figured something out.

02:08:02.278 --> 02:08:04.726
LAURA: That's actually a really good idea, Grog.
Maybe we should light the brazier.

02:08:04.726 --> 02:08:08.128
TALIESIN: We should light the brazier. That, or
raid the cabinets we passed.

02:08:08.128 --> 02:08:12.536
MATT: Allura, who's-- oh, so you're going to light
the brazier with your hand?

02:08:12.536 --> 02:08:17.280
MARISHA: Oh, I don't know. I was lighting my hand.
I can do it.

02:08:17.280 --> 02:08:18.801
TALIESIN: We're bringing the light back.

02:08:18.801 --> 02:08:23.966
MATT: Okay, so the room fills with light once
more. Kerrek, you can bring your hammer back if

02:08:23.966 --> 02:08:25.149
you'd like.

02:08:25.149 --> 02:08:27.311
LIAM: We're basically all running around the room
in circles.

02:08:27.311 --> 02:08:28.802
MATT: Yeah, you guys are just charging around.

02:08:28.802 --> 02:08:35.133
MARISHA: Are we gonna light this brazier? Keyleth
goes up and just sticks her flaming hand right

02:08:35.133 --> 02:08:36.746
down into the middle of the brazier.

02:08:36.746 --> 02:08:42.326
MATT: Okay. Your hand hits the top of the
kindling, at which point the wood catches, and

02:08:42.326 --> 02:08:49.678
there's a slight flash as the extremely explosive
materials that were within the brazier detonate,

02:08:49.678 --> 02:08:59.544
causing Percival, Allura, Vex, and Vax, who were
also reading the book nearby, to all have to make

02:08:59.544 --> 02:09:05.248
a dexterity saving throw. As there's a sudden
(explosion). It explodes with a force.

02:09:05.248 --> 02:09:07.787
MARISHA: Do I make a dexterity save as well?

02:09:07.787 --> 02:09:10.569
MATT: You don't make it, you just take the damage,
since you were at ground zero.

02:09:10.569 --> 02:09:11.803
MARISHA: Yeah, that's fair.

02:09:11.803 --> 02:09:16.074
PATRICK: To be fair, I was right next to the book
as well.

02:09:16.074 --> 02:09:18.687
MATT: That's right. So you go ahead and make a
dexterity saving throw as well, Kerrek.

02:09:18.687 --> 02:09:23.267
TALIESIN: That'll do.

02:09:23.267 --> 02:09:26.394
LAURA: 22.

02:09:26.394 --> 02:09:27.873
TALIESIN: 24.

02:09:27.873 --> 02:09:30.542
LIAM: 16 and a Luck blown.

02:09:30.542 --> 02:09:33.322
MATT: Kerrek, what'd you get?

02:09:33.322 --> 02:09:36.499
PATRICK: I got a three.

02:09:36.499 --> 02:09:38.497
LAURA: Oh no, Kerr!

02:09:38.497 --> 02:09:46.791
MATT: Oh, Allura made it, okay. Everyone but
Kerrek made the saving throw. So Kerrek and

02:09:46.791 --> 02:09:54.735
Keyleth, you both take 32 points of fire damage.
The rest of you take 16. You take none because

02:09:54.735 --> 02:09:56.105
you're a rogue.

02:09:56.105 --> 02:10:09.192
LIAM: Yeah. I start breakdancing, doing the worm
underneath the blast. Jeez, all right. The Luck wasn't

02:10:09.192 --> 02:10:12.911
blown, because the other roll was a one.

02:10:12.911 --> 02:10:14.929
MARISHA: Grog! Did you see that?

02:10:14.929 --> 02:10:17.928
TRAVIS: I did, but everything's really, really
bright right now.

02:10:17.928 --> 02:10:23.581
MATT: Your ears are ringing from the blast of the
impact, the brazier's just, all the metal's just

02:10:23.581 --> 02:10:24.883
bent outward and ruined.

02:10:24.883 --> 02:10:29.167
TRAVIS: I've just got the lit-up shapes of a bunch
of people going like that.

02:10:29.167 --> 02:10:31.634
MATT: As Keyleth turns around, you can see just
her hair's blown back a bit.

02:10:31.634 --> 02:10:34.006
She's like a cartoon character.

02:10:34.006 --> 02:10:36.708
TALIESIN: This has happened to me dozens of
times.

02:10:36.708 --> 02:10:38.051
MARISHA: That was awesome.

02:10:38.051 --> 02:10:41.613
LAURA: If Raishan didn't hear us before, she
potentially heard us now.

02:10:41.613 --> 02:10:44.576
TALIESIN: At least now we don't have to try and
stealth anymore.

02:10:44.576 --> 02:10:49.725
MARISHA: (shouting) Is the door open? I'm sorry if
I'm speaking loudly!

02:10:49.725 --> 02:10:52.120
(laughter)

02:10:52.120 --> 02:10:56.431
MATT: The door is not open.

02:10:56.431 --> 02:10:58.229
MARISHA: (shouting) The door is not open?

02:10:58.229 --> 02:10:59.639
LAURA: We need blood.

02:10:59.639 --> 02:11:02.108
TALIESIN: The book's fine, I assume?

02:11:02.108 --> 02:11:05.599
MATT: The book has burned entirely. It is
destroyed.

02:11:05.599 --> 02:11:06.934
TALIESIN: That's awesome.

02:11:06.934 --> 02:11:08.577
TRAVIS: Who cares about books?

02:11:08.577 --> 02:11:14.558
MATT: And you see Allura, who made the save but
took some damage, is at the back and is kind of

02:11:14.558 --> 02:11:18.040
chuckling to herself, goes, "Well, I think now we
know the purpose of the book."

02:11:18.040 --> 02:11:19.283
MARISHA: What?

02:11:19.283 --> 02:11:21.057
LAURA: Oh, that dick book.

02:11:21.057 --> 02:11:22.902
TRAVIS: No fucking way.

02:11:22.902 --> 02:11:32.816
MATT: "It was well-played, and curse be on the one
who thought that up."

02:11:32.816 --> 02:11:36.710
LAURA: (laughs) I know who that is.

02:11:36.710 --> 02:11:39.783
(laughter)

02:11:39.783 --> 02:11:44.501
TALIESIN: Do I recognize the smell of whatever
they used to ignite that, or was it more mystical

02:11:44.501 --> 02:11:45.667
in nature?

02:11:45.667 --> 02:11:54.396
MATT: It was a sort of mixture of extremely
flammable liquids. It was not black powder.

02:11:54.396 --> 02:12:00.890
TALIESIN: Okay, I was just curious. All right.
Well. Let's try and pour some of the dragon blood

02:12:00.890 --> 02:12:02.937
into the bowl and see if that does it.

02:12:02.937 --> 02:12:03.769
TRAVIS: Does what?

02:12:03.769 --> 02:12:05.366
LAURA: Opens the door.

02:12:05.366 --> 02:12:06.617
TRAVIS: Oh.

02:12:06.617 --> 02:12:09.955
TALIESIN: Let's blow a vial, see what happens.

02:12:09.955 --> 02:12:12.109
LAURA: Dragon blood is so expensive.

02:12:12.109 --> 02:12:13.439
TRAVIS: Can't we just knock it down?

02:12:13.439 --> 02:12:18.052
LAURA: I have basilisk blood, black dragon blood,
and white dragon blood.

02:12:18.052 --> 02:12:19.845
TALIESIN: Let's try basilisk and work our way up.

02:12:19.845 --> 02:12:22.326
TRAVIS: They're worth 7000 gold each.

02:12:22.326 --> 02:12:25.860
LAURA: I know, that's why the basilisk is better.
One basilisk vial.

02:12:25.860 --> 02:12:33.086
MATT: Okay, so as you uncork and let it flow, and
it's thick, syrupy, it hits and it pools. A moment

02:12:33.086 --> 02:12:35.374
passes. Two moments. Nothing.

02:12:35.374 --> 02:12:40.512
LAURA: Fuck. I pull out my opal dagger and I just
cut my hand and drip it in.

02:12:40.512 --> 02:12:48.233
MATT: Okay. The basilisk blood that's still in
there, you bleed into the basilisk blood, and it

02:12:48.233 --> 02:12:54.377
pools in the center of it. And you watch as the
blood that you just dropped gets pulled beneath

02:12:54.377 --> 02:12:56.221
the surface of the basilisk blood and out of
sight.

02:12:56.221 --> 02:13:00.191
LAURA: Creepy. Is the door opening?

02:13:00.191 --> 02:13:03.607
MATT: From the few drops of blood you put in
there, it has not opened.

02:13:03.607 --> 02:13:07.255
LAURA: It's like a kill-something sort of
situation.

02:13:07.255 --> 02:13:14.948
PATRICK: Kerrek is reaching out, kind of like,
don't-don't-don't. There's a lot of things in the

02:13:14.948 --> 02:13:17.924
world that shouldn't have your blood.

02:13:17.924 --> 02:13:21.140
LAURA: Oh. Well, shit. (laughs)

02:13:21.140 --> 02:13:31.364
PATRICK: Especially something clever enough to lay
a trap like that. Might be clever enough to trick

02:13:31.364 --> 02:13:34.396
a bunch of people into handing over blood.

02:13:34.396 --> 02:13:38.094
TRAVIS: How far is it to the door?

02:13:38.094 --> 02:13:42.334
MATT: From the pillar? About 15 feet.

02:13:42.334 --> 02:13:44.371
TRAVIS: I walk over to the door.

02:13:44.371 --> 02:13:45.529
MATT: Okay.

02:13:45.529 --> 02:13:47.707
LIAM: I'm gonna go with Grog. Yeah.

02:13:47.707 --> 02:13:49.001
LAURA: Punch it!

02:13:49.001 --> 02:13:50.677
TRAVIS: Can I-- would you mind--

02:13:50.677 --> 02:13:54.118
TALIESIN: You guys work on your thing. I'm gonna
work on another thing. I'm gonna go over to those

02:13:54.118 --> 02:13:56.197
other shelves, I'm gonna see what the fuck is up
there.

02:13:56.197 --> 02:13:59.796
MARISHA: I go with Percy. I do that. Inspecting
the shelves.

02:13:59.796 --> 02:14:02.188
TALIESIN: I'm gonna quick-jog to the other shelves
and take a look at those books.

02:14:02.188 --> 02:14:12.527
MATT: The door begins to shift. There's a slight
shaking sensation as the bowl itself begins to

02:14:12.527 --> 02:14:19.266
glow, and the basilisk's blood begins to sizzle and
burn away, almost like it's being pushed to the

02:14:19.266 --> 02:14:25.327
outer edges of the bowl with just the singular
drops from your blood resting in the center. The

02:14:25.327 --> 02:14:29.490
room begins to shake a bit, and you watch as dust
that had been alongside the ceiling begins to

02:14:29.490 --> 02:14:40.592
slightly cascade from above you. The metallic door
lifts up and reveals the other side.

02:14:40.592 --> 02:14:42.701
MARISHA: Completely? It's open?

02:14:42.701 --> 02:14:46.663
MATT: It's open. You do take a point of damage
from the blood that you lost.

02:14:46.663 --> 02:14:48.010
LAURA: Okay.

02:14:48.010 --> 02:14:53.306
MATT: So you guys are just starting to push out of
the room. At which point,

02:14:53.306 --> 02:14:57.398
you begin to hear laughter.

02:14:57.398 --> 02:14:58.994
TALIESIN: Oh, fuck.

02:14:58.994 --> 02:15:08.249
MATT: Cackling, multiple-sources laughter.
(cackling) And you watch as, down in the distance

02:15:08.249 --> 02:15:13.589
of each side of the hallway from where you came
and where you're going, these little sources of

02:15:13.589 --> 02:15:18.394
light suddenly spark up and begin drifting towards
you.

02:15:18.394 --> 02:15:20.038
LAURA: Pike immediately casts--

02:15:20.038 --> 02:15:22.077
LIAM: Beacon of Hope?

02:15:22.077 --> 02:15:29.741
LAURA: No, no, no, not that. She casts the other
thing. Shouldn't she? It's undead. Holy Aura on

02:15:29.741 --> 02:15:31.409
all of us.

02:15:31.409 --> 02:15:33.406
MATT: Okay. What does that do?

02:15:33.406 --> 02:15:41.244
LAURA: I wrote it all down. Hold on, hold on. It
is within a 30-foot radius where everybody is. It

02:15:41.244 --> 02:15:47.008
sheds a five-foot radius of light on everyone.
Everybody gets advantage on saving throws. Enemies

02:15:47.008 --> 02:15:55.033
who are attacking have disadvantage on everyone.
Fiends and undead who do melee attacks have to

02:15:55.033 --> 02:15:56.968
make a constitution save or be blinded.

02:15:56.968 --> 02:16:04.368
MATT: Okay. All right, so yeah, that's on
yourself, and it creates a 30-foot radius around

02:16:04.368 --> 02:16:10.124
you. As you guys all see these sources of light
hovering towards you, the cackling getting louder

02:16:10.124 --> 02:16:16.333
and louder from a source just out of view, Pike
grabs her holy symbol and slams her hand down onto

02:16:16.333 --> 02:16:21.066
the stonework in the center by where the pillar
is. As it hits, there's a (explosion) sound as the

02:16:21.066 --> 02:16:26.701
vibrations or impact shift through the ground, and
you feel the ground itself grow warm with radiant

02:16:26.701 --> 02:16:34.268
energy as a giant circle of ancient radiant runes
begin to connect and intersect, and within that

02:16:34.268 --> 02:16:37.704
circle you all kind of rush in, and as you do, you
feel the warmth of that protection come over you.

02:16:37.704 --> 02:16:46.686
As you all gather, with your weapons at the ready,
you see now the sources of light, as roughly four

02:16:46.686 --> 02:16:56.130
floating flame-wreathed skulls come rocketing in,
two from each side of the hallway, cackling along

02:16:56.130 --> 02:16:59.208
the way. And we're gonna take a break.

02:16:59.208 --> 02:17:01.353
(yelling)

02:17:01.353 --> 02:17:04.032
TRAVIS: Flaming skulls?

02:17:04.032 --> 02:17:05.569
MATT: Flaming skulls.

02:17:05.569 --> 02:17:06.851
MARISHA: Flame-wreathed skulls.

02:17:06.851 --> 02:17:11.654
MATT: Just floating towards you. You get the sense
that one of these may have, at one point, been

02:17:11.654 --> 02:17:13.030
contained within a bag.

02:17:13.030 --> 02:17:15.352
LIAM: Guys, it's fine, my ten-year-old son
destroyed one of these recently.

02:17:15.352 --> 02:17:17.242
We're gonna be fine.

02:17:17.242 --> 02:17:18.948
TALIESIN: Firecracker outside.

02:17:18.948 --> 02:17:22.741
MATT: All right, so. We'll be back here in a few
minutes. We're going to go ahead and take a

02:17:22.741 --> 02:17:27.031
restroom break, and we'll see where this next
chapter is.

02:17:27.031 --> 02:17:29.386
LAURA: Oh my god.

02:17:29.386 --> 02:32:07.788
[break]

02:32:07.788 --> 02:32:12.512
MATT: Welcome back, everyone, to Critical Role.
We're back from break. The party just found

02:32:12.512 --> 02:32:16.266
themselves immediately surrounded by large,
floating, flaming skulls in the center of this

02:32:16.266 --> 02:32:21.773
hallway, going towards the necromancer's sanctum.
I need you all to roll initiative, please.

02:32:21.773 --> 02:32:24.876
LIAM: (sings) Get it on.

02:32:24.876 --> 02:32:28.573
MARISHA: (laughing) It's the Kiss army.

02:32:28.573 --> 02:32:35.527
MATT: While they're rolling their initiatives, we
had a winner in the chatroom for a Wyrmwood

02:32:35.527 --> 02:32:40.560
Zebrawood complete dice tower system right here,
as well as this awesome leather thing from

02:32:40.560 --> 02:32:44.879
Wyrmwood, here, they have this nice leather band
as well. The winner is heartman_, by the way,

02:32:44.879 --> 02:32:46.523
congratulations, heartman_.

02:32:46.523 --> 02:32:48.169
MARISHA: I think you have Zebrawood.

02:32:48.169 --> 02:32:50.764
TALIESIN: Zebrawood is, I believe, the one that I
have.

02:32:50.764 --> 02:32:59.524
MATT: Delightful. So congratulations, we'll get
this to you ASAP. All righty. So. Getting

02:32:59.524 --> 02:33:02.406
initiative scores here from people. 25 to 20.

02:33:02.406 --> 02:33:03.879
MARISHA: Oh wait, we're rolling initiative.

02:33:03.879 --> 02:33:05.057
MATT: Yes.

02:33:05.057 --> 02:33:06.023
TRAVIS: Jesus.

02:33:06.023 --> 02:33:11.496
MARISHA: Fuck me. That's cocked. Natural 20.

02:33:11.496 --> 02:33:13.470
MATT: All right, so.

02:33:13.470 --> 02:33:16.950
MARISHA: Why can't I have these when it really
makes sense?

02:33:16.950 --> 02:33:18.192
TRAVIS: 25 to 20.

02:33:18.192 --> 02:33:19.722
MARISHA: 22 total.

02:33:19.722 --> 02:33:21.048
LIAM: 21.

02:33:21.048 --> 02:33:23.313
TALIESIN: 22 for Scanlan.

02:33:23.313 --> 02:33:25.925
MATT: Whoa! Scanlan's always in the rear.

02:33:25.925 --> 02:33:27.433
TALIESIN: He rolled a natural 20.

02:33:27.433 --> 02:33:30.773
MARISHA: Me and Scanlan, nat-20 brothers! For
Scanlan who's not here.

02:33:30.773 --> 02:33:41.852
MATT: That's awesome. Vax and Scanlan at the top.
All right. 20 to 15.

02:33:41.852 --> 02:33:43.143
LAURA: 16 for Vex.

02:33:43.143 --> 02:33:44.595
TALIESIN: 17.

02:33:44.595 --> 02:33:48.845
MATT: Percy, Vex. 15 to ten?

02:33:48.845 --> 02:33:51.724
TRAVIS: Me. 14.

02:33:51.724 --> 02:33:53.581
MATT: All righty.

02:33:53.581 --> 02:34:04.141
PATRICK: Just out of curiosity, do you allow
people to delay their action to

02:34:04.141 --> 02:34:05.775
act later in the turn?

02:34:05.775 --> 02:34:10.798
MATT: You can hold an action, meaning you still
take your turn, you still move, but you can hold

02:34:10.798 --> 02:34:16.701
your action for a trigger. So like, I will hold my
action to attack if something comes in range. Or I

02:34:16.701 --> 02:34:20.651
can hold my action to cast a spell when a certain
creature does something. But you still take your

02:34:20.651 --> 02:34:22.771
turn, you don't move the turn order.

02:34:22.771 --> 02:34:23.921
TRAVIS: What'd Pike roll?

02:34:23.921 --> 02:34:25.522
LAURA: Pike rolled a nine.

02:34:25.522 --> 02:34:27.986
MATT: Pike at the end. Kerrek, what'd you get?

02:34:27.986 --> 02:34:30.286
PATRICK: A one.

02:34:30.286 --> 02:34:32.132
MATT: Oh, Kerr.

02:34:32.132 --> 02:34:33.366
LIAM: Number one.

02:34:33.366 --> 02:34:35.046
MARISHA: Pike?

02:34:35.046 --> 02:34:36.297
LAURA: Nine.

02:34:36.297 --> 02:34:37.921
MARISHA: Who rolled one?

02:34:37.921 --> 02:34:39.034
LAURA: Kerr.

02:34:39.034 --> 02:34:43.692
MATT: It's okay. You and Kima are down there. All
right, so.

02:34:43.692 --> 02:34:45.002
PATRICK: The term is anchor-man.

02:34:45.002 --> 02:34:46.595
LAURA: I like it.

02:34:46.595 --> 02:34:50.437
MATT: All righty. So, at the top of the round, as
these skulls are beginning to find their way in

02:34:50.437 --> 02:34:54.980
towards the cavern towards you, as you've all
circled around Pike in the center of this chamber

02:34:54.980 --> 02:34:58.647
here, I would like Scanlan and Vax to go first.

02:34:58.647 --> 02:35:01.769
LIAM: All right. After you, Scanman.

02:35:01.769 --> 02:35:06.585
TALIESIN: I can turn myself invisible? It's a
level three spell?

02:35:06.585 --> 02:35:07.702
MATT: You can.

02:35:07.702 --> 02:35:14.545
TALIESIN: I'm gonna turn invisible and back up
against the northern wall in the corner and see if

02:35:14.545 --> 02:35:15.996
the skulls notice.

02:35:15.996 --> 02:35:24.171
MATT: Okay. So Scanlan is gonna go invisible and
back up here.

02:35:24.171 --> 02:35:26.298
MARISHA: It's a 2nd-level spell.

02:35:26.298 --> 02:35:28.338
MATT: All righty. 2nd level.

02:35:28.338 --> 02:35:32.770
TALIESIN: And I'm going to hold my action until I
find out whether or not--

02:35:32.770 --> 02:35:34.428
oh, invisible is my action.

02:35:34.428 --> 02:35:36.082
MATT: Casting the spell is your action.

02:35:36.082 --> 02:35:38.536
TALIESIN: All right. I'm gonna back up, and yeah.

02:35:38.536 --> 02:35:44.310
MATT: Okay. So you back up against the wall there.
Okay. So that's your turn. Vax.

02:35:44.310 --> 02:35:50.096
LIAM: Can you point to where I am in that scrum? I
can't tell. I'm going to move to the opposite wall

02:35:50.096 --> 02:35:51.818
that Scanlan just went to.

02:35:51.818 --> 02:35:54.217
MATT: So over here?

02:35:54.217 --> 02:35:58.614
LIAM: Yeah, and I'll fly ten feet-- I'm winged, so
I'll be ten feet in the air as well.

02:35:58.614 --> 02:36:01.340
MATT: Okay. I'll put you up on here.

02:36:01.340 --> 02:36:08.032
LIAM: And I'm gonna huck a pair of daggers at-- I
hope this is the right way-- the one on this side

02:36:08.032 --> 02:36:09.498
that's closest to you.

02:36:09.498 --> 02:36:11.140
MATT: Right here. Okay, go for it.

02:36:11.140 --> 02:36:16.943
LIAM: That's shit. And then the second one--

02:36:16.943 --> 02:36:20.491
LAURA: Well, don't write it off, it was 15, that
first one.

02:36:20.491 --> 02:36:23.342
LIAM: That's true, it's a 15 and then a 23.

02:36:23.342 --> 02:36:25.031
MATT: Both hit.

02:36:25.031 --> 02:36:34.987
LIAM: Hey! All right, so first one is with
Whisper. That is four plus eight is 12, plus

02:36:34.987 --> 02:36:44.818
psychic damage, which is 19 for the first hit. And
from the venom dagger that I'm throwing next, that

02:36:44.818 --> 02:36:48.358
is four plus six is ten. Ten total.

02:36:48.358 --> 02:36:53.309
MATT: So 19 points of damage total. Awesome. That
end your turn?

02:36:53.309 --> 02:36:54.905
LIAM: That's the end of my turn.

02:36:54.905 --> 02:36:56.326
MATT: All right. That brings us to Keyleth.

02:36:56.326 --> 02:36:58.864
MARISHA: Oh dear god, I knew you were gonna say
that. Hang on, hang on, I'm looking up the

02:36:58.864 --> 02:37:02.201
parameters of the spell. Let me see. L-M-N-O--

02:37:02.201 --> 02:37:06.996
TRAVIS: What happened when he hit 'em with those
daggers?

02:37:06.996 --> 02:37:13.546
MATT: As both these daggers slam into the skull,
you watch as the flames themselves that are kind

02:37:13.546 --> 02:37:16.833
of wreathing around them, the skull just ducks out
of the way, but the blade still catches and

02:37:16.833 --> 02:37:22.474
scrapes across the side of the bone, and it has to
right itself, but then it gets right back into the

02:37:22.474 --> 02:37:26.183
place it was. It's taking damage, and you can see
portions of the bone are starting to crack and

02:37:26.183 --> 02:37:29.888
break, but it's still, you know, still holding
itself aloft.

02:37:29.888 --> 02:37:32.074
LAURA: Did its little jawbone go (chattering
teeth)?

02:37:32.074 --> 02:37:40.590
MATT: Not yet. It's not its turn yet. It's an
action to chatter. I'll get you, He-Man! No.

02:37:40.590 --> 02:37:42.403
LIAM: You boob!

02:37:42.403 --> 02:37:52.195
MATT: (sings) Oh my god do I pray. Anyway. Sorry.
Oh, internet. Never change.

02:37:52.195 --> 02:37:55.560
MARISHA: (sings) For a revolution.

02:37:55.560 --> 02:37:57.305
MATT: So what are you doing for your action,
Keyleth?

02:37:57.305 --> 02:37:58.496
MARISHA: Huh?

02:37:58.496 --> 02:37:59.875
TALIESIN: She's inspiring.

02:37:59.875 --> 02:38:01.096
MARISHA: I got inspired?

02:38:01.096 --> 02:38:02.593
MATT: No. What are you doing on your turn.

02:38:02.593 --> 02:38:06.190
TRAVIS: Did you stick cotton in your ears during
the break?

02:38:06.190 --> 02:38:13.487
MARISHA: Sorry, I got distracted. Okay.

02:38:13.487 --> 02:38:16.767
MATT: Next to Allura, and you have Kerrek to your
other side.

02:38:16.767 --> 02:38:19.191
MARISHA: Which direction were we heading?

02:38:19.191 --> 02:38:23.903
MATT: You were heading this direction. The giant
gate was here, and it lifted up, and then all the

02:38:23.903 --> 02:38:25.816
skulls swarmed in from that side.

02:38:25.816 --> 02:38:27.690
MARISHA: There's only two right now?

02:38:27.690 --> 02:38:30.921
MATT: There's four, there's two on this side, two
on this side.

02:38:30.921 --> 02:38:49.066
MARISHA: Okay. I'm going to cast Moonbeam on...
hm. Let me do this one. That guy. That make sense?

02:38:49.066 --> 02:38:55.648
So it's 120 foot, it's a concentration spell up to
a minute, and it's a five-foot radius,

02:38:55.648 --> 02:39:09.298
40-foot-high cylinder. It causes searing pain and
takes 2d10 radiant damage after a constitution

02:39:09.298 --> 02:39:10.717
saving throw.

02:39:10.717 --> 02:39:14.291
MATT: Okay, so constitution saving throw on each
of these guys here?

02:39:14.291 --> 02:39:15.575
MARISHA: It's a five-foot radius.

02:39:15.575 --> 02:39:19.323
MATT: Okay, so you can hit one-- oh, if you hit
there, you can hit 'em both.

02:39:19.323 --> 02:39:22.110
MARISHA: Can I? Then I do that.

02:39:22.110 --> 02:39:27.825
MATT: All righty. And they-- that is a 16.

02:39:27.825 --> 02:39:29.174
MARISHA: Fail.

02:39:29.174 --> 02:39:31.376
MATT: And a 13. So no, they fail 'em both.

02:39:31.376 --> 02:39:33.360
(cheering)

02:39:33.360 --> 02:39:41.614
MARISHA: Oh, that's good. Above average. Six plus
seven is 13 points of damage.

02:39:41.614 --> 02:39:43.490
MATT: 13 points of damage to both of them.

02:39:43.490 --> 02:39:46.409
MARISHA: You know, just a little bit of radiant
damage.

02:39:46.409 --> 02:39:54.891
MATT: So as the beam bursts out from the sky, you
see the white radiant nature energy burst around

02:39:54.891 --> 02:39:59.081
them, and the flames seem to subside for a moment
as the one that's already been damaged by Vax

02:39:59.081 --> 02:40:06.153
almost stumbles to the floor, then picks itself
back up, its flame flickering more so than the

02:40:06.153 --> 02:40:10.289
allies around you. That end your turn, Keyleth?
You gonna stay where you are or you gonna move?

02:40:10.289 --> 02:40:12.241
MARISHA: I'm on the-- are we all on the carpet?

02:40:12.241 --> 02:40:14.928
MATT: No, no one's been on the carpet.

02:40:14.928 --> 02:40:22.898
MARISHA: We never did that. Then I will back away
towards me and towards the southeast corner.

02:40:22.898 --> 02:40:25.647
MATT: Over here? Okay.

02:40:25.647 --> 02:40:28.003
MARISHA: Yeah. Southeast to you.

02:40:28.003 --> 02:40:29.021
MATT: More south?

02:40:29.021 --> 02:40:31.333
MARISHA: No, no, that's right, that's right.
That's good.

02:40:31.333 --> 02:40:44.255
MATT: That ends your turn? All right. It is now
the flame skulls' turn. So. All four of these

02:40:44.255 --> 02:40:50.399
skulls, you watch as the flames swirl around the
head, pour into the skull itself, and for a

02:40:50.399 --> 02:40:56.276
second, the flame almost goes dark, as all of a
sudden the eyes burst into angry fire, the mouth

02:40:56.276 --> 02:41:01.532
grows extremely bright, and a single red beam
streaks forth from the jaw to the center of the

02:41:01.532 --> 02:41:10.388
room. Four of these beams in different directions
here, followed by four simultaneous familiar

02:41:10.388 --> 02:41:14.293
explosions as four separate Fireballs rock the
room.

02:41:14.293 --> 02:41:16.473
LIAM: Four. Separate. Fireballs.

02:41:16.473 --> 02:41:18.770
TRAVIS: Fuck.

02:41:18.770 --> 02:41:21.127
LAURA: We're gonna die just from fucking--

02:41:21.127 --> 02:41:26.243
LIAM: Wow, look at that. Everybody.

02:41:26.243 --> 02:41:28.093
MATT: Yeah, you guys clustered right there.

02:41:28.093 --> 02:41:30.507
LAURA: Well, we didn't get a chance to move!

02:41:30.507 --> 02:41:32.984
MARISHA: This is the room!

02:41:32.984 --> 02:41:35.918
MATT: Well no, you guys said you all were gonna
back in around Pike,

02:41:35.918 --> 02:41:37.340
and you haven't had your turn yet.

02:41:37.340 --> 02:41:39.655
MARISHA: It's also still the room.

02:41:39.655 --> 02:41:42.793
MATT: I know. I know. This happens, guys. Sorry.

02:41:42.793 --> 02:41:46.151
TRAVIS: Like, where else were we gonna go? It's a
huge explosion.

02:41:46.151 --> 02:41:52.159
MATT: Not knowing or seeing where Sam went, they
all focus here, which will affect everybody. So I

02:41:52.159 --> 02:41:55.422
need everybody to make four dexterity saving
throws. Now, mind you--

02:41:55.422 --> 02:41:57.340
MARISHA: Everyone except Scanlan? Or still
Scanlan?

02:41:57.340 --> 02:41:58.692
MATT: Everyone except for Scanlan.

02:41:58.692 --> 02:42:01.121
LAURA: And everybody's got advantage on every
single one of those rolls.

02:42:01.121 --> 02:42:02.501
MARISHA: Wait, dex throws?

02:42:02.501 --> 02:42:04.386
MATT: All saving throws you have advantage on.

02:42:04.386 --> 02:42:06.398
TALIESIN: Four saving throws with advantage.

02:42:06.398 --> 02:42:08.901
LIAM: You crazy motherfucker.

02:42:08.901 --> 02:42:12.523
TRAVIS: God damn it, that's the same number.

02:42:12.523 --> 02:42:16.214
MATT: You're trying to beat a 13.

02:42:16.214 --> 02:42:24.282
MARISHA: How many do we-- oh, we have to roll it
each time?

02:42:24.282 --> 02:42:26.029
MATT: Yeah, for each one.

02:42:26.029 --> 02:42:41.338
MARISHA: Natural 20 on my second. We're trying to
beat a 13?

02:42:41.338 --> 02:42:43.496
MATT: Trying to beat a 13.

02:42:43.496 --> 02:42:46.325
MARISHA: I cleared all of them.

02:42:46.325 --> 02:42:47.768
TALIESIN: Cleared all of them.

02:42:47.768 --> 02:42:52.218
LIAM: Cleared all of them. Evasion.

02:42:52.218 --> 02:42:54.393
LAURA: Wait, I gotta do them for Pike.

02:42:54.393 --> 02:42:58.527
MARISHA: No rolls for Scanlan. Okay.

02:42:58.527 --> 02:43:17.669
LAURA: Fuck. (sighs) Do I have to roll for
Trinket, too? Oh, god.

02:43:17.669 --> 02:43:19.448
MATT: Everyone was there.

02:43:19.448 --> 02:43:24.461
LAURA: Okay, Pike saves two and fails two. Vex
saves all.

02:43:24.461 --> 02:43:26.119
MATT: Okay.

02:43:26.119 --> 02:43:30.308
LAURA: God.

02:43:30.308 --> 02:43:38.254
TRAVIS: These little disembodied bastards are
tough.

02:43:38.254 --> 02:43:40.363
LAURA: Trinket only saves against one.

02:43:40.363 --> 02:43:42.255
TRAVIS: What are these called?

02:43:42.255 --> 02:43:43.594
PATRICK: Even with advantage?

02:43:43.594 --> 02:43:45.164
LAURA: Even with advantage.

02:43:45.164 --> 02:43:46.514
TALIESIN: It's her magic power.

02:43:46.514 --> 02:43:52.189
LAURA: Trinket just constantly-- I didn't add
anything. Oh, well, he had a plus two.

02:43:52.189 --> 02:43:53.333
MATT: Grog.

02:43:53.333 --> 02:43:56.619
TRAVIS: I failed the first two, succeeded on the
second two. Ten, ten, 21, 21.

02:43:56.619 --> 02:44:06.656
MATT: Okay. So you take 76 points of fire damage.
Percy.

02:44:06.656 --> 02:44:08.569
TALIESIN: Save, save, save, save.

02:44:08.569 --> 02:44:13.666
MATT: Okay. So you take-- Grog, I said 78, right?

02:44:13.666 --> 02:44:16.380
TRAVIS: You said 72.

02:44:16.380 --> 02:44:32.729
MATT: Sorry, 72. That is 48 points of fire damage
to you, Percy.

02:44:32.729 --> 02:44:38.527
MARISHA: You saved from all of 'em? Same. 17,
natural 20, 14, 18.

02:44:38.527 --> 02:44:48.894
TALIESIN: 42 points of damage? Wait, how much?

02:44:48.894 --> 02:44:54.659
MATT: Sorry, this is a lot of Fireballs and a lot
of rolls right now. So for Percival, altogether,

02:44:54.659 --> 02:45:05.314
if you made all the saves, it would be-- shit.
Okay.

02:45:05.314 --> 02:45:07.356
TALIESIN: Some mild asbestos in the coat.

02:45:07.356 --> 02:45:08.831
MARISHA: Made of polyester.

02:45:08.831 --> 02:45:21.984
MATT: We'll say, for the sake of this and the ease
of the damage here, you take 56 points of fire

02:45:21.984 --> 02:45:23.206
damage, Percy.

02:45:23.206 --> 02:45:24.264
TALIESIN: How much, sorry?

02:45:24.264 --> 02:45:25.800
MATT: 56 points of fire damage.

02:45:25.800 --> 02:45:29.160
MARISHA: If you saved against all of them, 56?

02:45:29.160 --> 02:45:30.499
MATT: Yes.

02:45:30.499 --> 02:45:32.108
TRAVIS: Should I have taken more?

02:45:32.108 --> 02:45:35.352
MATT: You technically would've taken-- no, you
took 70.

02:45:35.352 --> 02:45:36.823
TRAVIS: I failed two.

02:45:36.823 --> 02:45:38.812
MATT: That's right, you failed two. So that would
be...

02:45:38.812 --> 02:45:47.844
MARISHA: That's with a nat 20?

02:45:47.844 --> 02:45:49.071
MATT: You take 88.

02:45:49.071 --> 02:45:50.749
LAURA: Oh my lord.

02:45:50.749 --> 02:45:52.953
MARISHA: With a nat 20, you still take half
damage?

02:45:52.953 --> 02:45:54.916
MATT: Yeah. So how many did you get, Keyleth?

02:45:54.916 --> 02:45:57.928
MARISHA: I saved all of them, so I'm at 50 hit
points.

02:45:57.928 --> 02:46:01.776
MATT: Okay. Kerrek, how many did you save?

02:46:01.776 --> 02:46:05.121
PATRICK: I did, I made all of them, thanks to the
advantage.

02:46:05.121 --> 02:46:06.828
LIAM: Nice, Kerrek.

02:46:06.828 --> 02:46:09.223
MATT: So you take 56 points of fire damage.

02:46:09.223 --> 02:46:12.899
LIAM: I saved all of them with Evasion. That's
zero, yeah?

02:46:12.899 --> 02:46:14.344
MATT: Yeah, so you take zero.

02:46:14.344 --> 02:46:15.613
LIAM: Yeah, flat against the ground.

02:46:15.613 --> 02:46:17.579
MATT: You just duck out of the way. Vex?

02:46:17.579 --> 02:46:19.380
LAURA: I saved against all of them.

02:46:19.380 --> 02:46:20.860
MATT: 56 points of fire damage.

02:46:20.860 --> 02:46:22.586
LAURA: So I'm at 57 hit points now.

02:46:22.586 --> 02:46:25.185
MATT: Okay. Pike failed two?

02:46:25.185 --> 02:46:27.882
LAURA: She failed two of them, yeah, so 88.

02:46:27.882 --> 02:46:30.200
MATT: 88, but half that, because she has fire
resistance, so 44.

02:46:30.200 --> 02:46:39.654
LAURA: Oh, thank god. Okay. That's good, that's
good. And then Trinket only got one, so he's in my

02:46:39.654 --> 02:46:43.146
necklace. Already.

02:46:43.146 --> 02:46:44.467
LIAM: Luckily, luckily.

02:46:44.467 --> 02:46:50.476
MATT: You can bring him out and heal him in a
minute, if you want to. That brings Allura,

02:46:50.476 --> 02:47:01.682
through her Barrier and extra hit points, that
brings her to-- okay, there we go. And Kima also

02:47:01.682 --> 02:47:07.434
failed two, so she took... All righty.

02:47:07.434 --> 02:47:11.355
PATRICK: If I'm still hugging Grog, can I use him
as partial cover?

02:47:11.355 --> 02:47:13.391
(laughter)

02:47:13.391 --> 02:47:18.399
MATT: Going forward, you can, yes. From the
curling flames of the arcane blasts,

02:47:18.399 --> 02:47:26.089
unfortunately, not that much cover from that.
However, they all then go ahead and scoot back

02:47:26.089 --> 02:47:31.149
towards the wall. The holy radius itself is
starting to affect them, so this one is starting

02:47:31.149 --> 02:47:34.307
to back up in this direction, and these two are
going to go ahead and this one's going to curl

02:47:34.307 --> 02:47:40.630
around the fallen stonework and land there. That
is going to end their turn.

02:47:40.630 --> 02:47:42.176
TRAVIS: We're in a fucking kill box.

02:47:42.176 --> 02:47:44.599
TALIESIN: It's a box of kill.

02:47:44.599 --> 02:47:47.065
MATT: Now that brings us to Percival's turn.

02:47:47.065 --> 02:47:54.201
TALIESIN: I'm irritated. So which was the one that
you were shooting at?

02:47:54.201 --> 02:47:56.979
MARISHA: There's one that's almost dead. What's
the one that's almost dead?

02:47:56.979 --> 02:47:58.619
LIAM: Yeah, the one that Matt just touched.

02:47:58.619 --> 02:48:10.546
TALIESIN: I'm gonna start with him, and I'm going
to, just to be a dick, I'm going to pull some

02:48:10.546 --> 02:48:13.680
deadeye and a sharpshooter on this one.

02:48:13.680 --> 02:48:15.046
LIAM: Get out of the box!

02:48:15.046 --> 02:48:17.616
TALIESIN: So I'm going to start with him, taking a
shot with Animus.

02:48:17.616 --> 02:48:20.094
LAURA: Animus?

02:48:20.094 --> 02:48:26.756
TALIESIN: With the Animus gun, which is, with the
sharpshooter on, is 26 to hit.

02:48:26.756 --> 02:48:28.761
MATT: Yeah, that hits, so roll damage for that.

02:48:28.761 --> 02:48:37.982
TALIESIN: That's-- sorry, I'm a little out of it.
What do I need? I need one of these. Oh, I'll use

02:48:37.982 --> 02:48:54.607
this one, it's prettier. Just counting the dice.
That's nice! That's 17, 27 points of damage, plus

02:48:54.607 --> 02:48:56.088
two points of psychic damage.

02:48:56.088 --> 02:49:00.802
MATT: Okay. As you take your first shot, the one
skull's just trying to duck around the partially

02:49:00.802 --> 02:49:05.448
crumbled wall, you catch it right before it goes
behind cover, and as your bullet hits from the

02:49:05.448 --> 02:49:11.413
side, the skull just explodes and shatters into a
burst of flame and broken bone, expelled and

02:49:11.413 --> 02:49:13.566
extinguished on the battlefield.

02:49:13.566 --> 02:49:15.150
MARISHA: Fucking dick.

02:49:15.150 --> 02:49:16.551
TALIESIN: Next shot. (laughs)

02:49:16.551 --> 02:49:20.884
MARISHA: Do you get a grit point? You get a grit
point back.

02:49:20.884 --> 02:49:24.288
TALIESIN: I killed it, so grit point back.
Actually, and I'm going to spend another grit

02:49:24.288 --> 02:49:28.818
point for the same shot. So yes. That's--

02:49:28.818 --> 02:49:31.380
TRAVIS: These are not living creatures, though,
right?

02:49:31.380 --> 02:49:32.596
MATT: They are not.

02:49:32.596 --> 02:49:37.219
TALIESIN: I'm gonna just switch to the one-- yeah,
just gonna switch

02:49:37.219 --> 02:49:38.712
so that we're not flanked by the--

02:49:38.712 --> 02:49:40.290
TRAVIS: Flaming jungle mob?

02:49:40.290 --> 02:49:45.040
TALIESIN: Same sharpshooter, same thing. Same
attack. 26.

02:49:45.040 --> 02:49:46.467
MATT: Hits.

02:49:46.467 --> 02:49:55.214
TALIESIN: That's not as good, but it's okay. 22
points of damage,

02:49:55.214 --> 02:49:56.443
plus six points of psychic damage.

02:49:56.443 --> 02:50:04.524
MATT: Okay. All righty. So this shot impacts, and
it sends it slamming into the wall, and it rights

02:50:04.524 --> 02:50:10.573
itself back in its position, but you can see
noticeable cracks across the bone cranium of it,

02:50:10.573 --> 02:50:14.835
and little bits of fire are poking through areas
where it's starting to come apart, but it's still

02:50:14.835 --> 02:50:16.598
keeping itself together at the moment.

02:50:16.598 --> 02:50:25.332
TALIESIN: I'm going to take another shot at it.
Sharpshooter, but not with the deadeye. Pew-pew.

02:50:25.332 --> 02:50:26.802
Not as good a shot. 16?

02:50:26.802 --> 02:50:29.161
MATT: 16 still hits.

02:50:29.161 --> 02:50:30.589
TALIESIN: That'll do.

02:50:30.589 --> 02:50:32.802
MARISHA: Kill it! Kill it!

02:50:32.802 --> 02:50:36.770
TALIESIN: That's 20 points of damage, with four
points of psychic damage.

02:50:36.770 --> 02:50:43.255
MATT: That does it. Another blast echoes through
as the gunshot goes off. You watch as the

02:50:43.255 --> 02:50:48.043
secondary light source from that side of the
hallway just is immediately extinguished. That

02:50:48.043 --> 02:50:51.751
hallway goes dark once more, the two glowing
lights untouched on the area

02:50:51.751 --> 02:50:53.665
you came from still standing.

02:50:53.665 --> 02:51:02.514
TALIESIN: I do a quick reload, and I run up the
wall to-- yeah, that way, but to an angle? Yeah,

02:51:02.514 --> 02:51:04.067
I'm gonna perch up there.

02:51:04.067 --> 02:51:05.879
MARISHA: Grit point back.

02:51:05.879 --> 02:51:07.873
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, I get the grit point back.
Thank you.

02:51:07.873 --> 02:51:14.755
MATT: I like how Keyleth is becoming your paper
clip for this battle.

02:51:14.755 --> 02:51:16.595
MARISHA: Did you know?

02:51:16.595 --> 02:51:19.276
TALIESIN: I'm trying to write.

02:51:19.276 --> 02:51:28.734
PATRICK: Sorry, I meant to mention this before.
And this might not be relevant because everyone

02:51:28.734 --> 02:51:34.668
has just made eight saving throws or rolled eight
saving throw dice. Everyone close to me, because

02:51:34.668 --> 02:51:39.937
of my Aura of Divinity, gets a plus three because
of my charisma bonus.

02:51:39.937 --> 02:51:41.543
MATT: That's true.

02:51:41.543 --> 02:51:45.893
PATRICK: I would not bring it up after the fact if
that was not just such

02:51:45.893 --> 02:51:48.557
an ungodly buttload of damage.

02:51:48.557 --> 02:51:50.264
TRAVIS: Doesn't affect my rolls.

02:51:50.264 --> 02:51:53.619
MATT: That would affect your rolls. You would get
plus three to any--

02:51:53.619 --> 02:51:55.092
TRAVIS: Still didn't make it, though.

02:51:55.092 --> 02:52:00.039
MATT: So it didn't help Grog. Pike is the only one
that's near you that would've gotten the benefit.

02:52:00.039 --> 02:52:02.611
LAURA: That would've gotten Pike up to one of--
she would've failed one of them.

02:52:02.611 --> 02:52:11.841
MATT: Okay. So take 22 points of fire damage off--
or no, it would be half that. 11 points.

02:52:11.841 --> 02:52:13.038
Take 11 points off.

02:52:13.038 --> 02:52:14.598
LIAM: That's for saves, not on attacks, right?

02:52:14.598 --> 02:52:15.690
MATT: Correct, just saves.

02:52:15.690 --> 02:52:16.799
LAURA: So add 11 points back.

02:52:16.799 --> 02:52:19.281
MARISHA: Yeah, I saved all mine. You saved all
yours.

02:52:19.281 --> 02:52:21.929
PATRICK: But didn't Grog roll tens, and he needs a 13?

02:52:22.117 --> 02:52:24.607
MATT: So what'd you roll as your final rolls?

02:52:24.607 --> 02:52:25.956
TRAVIS: Ten, ten, 21, 21.

02:52:25.956 --> 02:52:28.955
MATT: So that would've made 13 roll. So yeah, that
would've.

02:52:28.955 --> 02:52:30.347
LAURA: You would've saved on everything.

02:52:30.347 --> 02:52:36.712
TRAVIS: Hey! So if you saved on all of them, how
many points of damage would you take?

02:52:36.712 --> 02:52:38.315
MATT: All of them would have been 56.

02:52:38.315 --> 02:52:39.769
TRAVIS: Got it, 56.

02:52:39.769 --> 02:52:46.577
LAURA: Trinket still would've failed three. Just
to put that out there, he rolled so poorly.

02:52:46.577 --> 02:52:47.610
MATT: Even with the plus three?

02:52:47.610 --> 02:52:50.972
LAURA: Even with the plus three, Trinket would not
have gotten up to 13 on three of those.

02:52:50.972 --> 02:52:52.023
TRAVIS: Thank you, Kerr!

02:52:52.023 --> 02:52:55.572
TALIESIN: You know, I've been led to believe that
bears had more affinity with dealing with forest

02:52:55.572 --> 02:53:00.358
fires in general. I feel it's just-- this is
definitely a problem.

02:53:00.358 --> 02:53:01.697
LIAM: Somewhere, Sam is laughing.

02:53:01.697 --> 02:53:04.237
LAURA: Oh, poor Trinket. He's just--

02:53:04.237 --> 02:53:06.375
LIAM: He's good at cuddles.

02:53:06.375 --> 02:53:07.998
TALIESIN: Do you have a bald bear?

02:53:07.998 --> 02:53:09.601
MARISHA: With a little singed hair?

02:53:09.601 --> 02:53:13.613
MATT: All right, Percy, that ends your turn?

02:53:13.613 --> 02:53:14.958
TRAVIS: Percy, does that end your turn?

02:53:14.958 --> 02:53:16.345
MATT: Vex, you're up.

02:53:16.345 --> 02:53:26.948
LAURA: Oh, I'm up. Okay. I'm going to shoot them.
I'm going to shoot the one closer to you.

02:53:26.948 --> 02:53:28.391
MATT: Okay, there you go.

02:53:28.391 --> 02:53:33.924
LAURA: That definitely hits.

02:53:33.924 --> 02:53:35.308
MATT: Okay.

02:53:35.308 --> 02:53:49.344
LAURA: 16 damage plus three lightning damage.

02:53:49.344 --> 02:53:50.946
MATT: Okay, got it.

02:53:50.946 --> 02:53:57.049
LAURA: And then, fuck me, I Hunter's Mark him.

02:53:57.049 --> 02:54:02.450
MATT: (laughs) Okay. He has been Hunter's Marked.

02:54:02.450 --> 02:54:10.480
LAURA: I attack him again. Natural 20!

02:54:10.480 --> 02:54:13.069
(cheering)

02:54:13.069 --> 02:54:14.325
MATT: Well, there you go.

02:54:14.325 --> 02:54:18.386
TALIESIN: I was gonna say, somehow a skull is
giving you shade, and now he's not.

02:54:18.386 --> 02:54:30.826
LAURA: 20 plus eight lightning damage plus eight
Hunter's Mark.

02:54:30.826 --> 02:54:33.449
'Cause you double all your dice, right?

02:54:33.449 --> 02:54:39.611
MATT: You double the dice, yeah. So that's 20 plus
eight plus another eight.

02:54:39.611 --> 02:54:41.937
LAURA: So 28 plus eight lightning damage.

02:54:41.937 --> 02:54:49.243
MATT: Yeah. That secondary arrow happens to just
hit right on the suture at the side of the skull,

02:54:49.243 --> 02:54:54.366
and as it hits, the arrow cuts through and causes
the skull to crack in half, and you hear this kind

02:54:54.366 --> 02:55:00.549
of shriek, and the laughter fades, as it pulls
back and the flame just flickers out, and the two

02:55:00.549 --> 02:55:04.431
pieces of bone just clatter to the ground and
break across the stone.

02:55:04.431 --> 02:55:16.894
LAURA: I move away from him into the-- oh, on the
opposite side of Percy.

02:55:16.894 --> 02:55:25.238
MATT: Okay, so this way? 30, you can get about
there. All right. That ends your turn, Vex. Grog,

02:55:25.238 --> 02:55:26.215
you're up.

02:55:26.215 --> 02:55:28.794
TRAVIS: (yells) I run at the last remaining
skull.

02:55:28.794 --> 02:55:31.116
LIAM: Hey you guys!

02:55:31.116 --> 02:55:32.657
TRAVIS: In a rage.

02:55:32.657 --> 02:55:36.838
MATT: You get right up to it.

02:55:36.838 --> 02:55:38.975
TRAVIS: I'd like to play teeball, please.

02:55:38.975 --> 02:55:40.259
MATT: Okay, go for it.

02:55:40.259 --> 02:55:46.281
TRAVIS: With this new Dwarven Thrower. Should've
tried throwing it, but too late for that. With

02:55:46.281 --> 02:55:48.242
reckless, great weapon master, please.

02:55:48.242 --> 02:55:49.651
MATT: Go for it.

02:55:49.651 --> 02:55:59.178
TRAVIS: 33 minus five is 28?

02:55:59.178 --> 02:56:04.265
MATT: That hits. You don't add the extra d8, since
you only get that when you throw it.

02:56:04.265 --> 02:56:15.793
TRAVIS: Right. Shit, wait. Yeah. 26.

02:56:15.793 --> 02:56:18.134
MATT: 26 damage.

02:56:18.134 --> 02:56:21.207
TRAVIS: No, I'm sorry, the second hit was 26 to
hit.

02:56:21.207 --> 02:56:22.873
MATT: Oh, I see. What was the damage on the first
one?

02:56:22.873 --> 02:56:24.666
TRAVIS: I didn't do it yet.

02:56:24.666 --> 02:56:26.090
MATT: Oh, okay.

02:56:26.090 --> 02:56:29.254
TRAVIS: Now I've done it. What the fuck is that?

02:56:29.254 --> 02:56:31.899
MATT: Welcome to d8s, motherfucker.

02:56:31.899 --> 02:56:38.021
TRAVIS: I know. That's a six, plus-- I'm raging,
so 20 points of damage.

02:56:38.021 --> 02:56:43.693
MATT: Okay. You slam across the side of the skull.
It slams against the side of the wall where you

02:56:43.693 --> 02:56:46.905
hit it, and as it rights itself, you go with your
second attack, which does hit. Roll damage for

02:56:46.905 --> 02:56:47.921
that one.

02:56:47.921 --> 02:56:51.126
MARISHA: What the fuck is that? It's a number.

02:56:51.126 --> 02:56:52.412
TRAVIS: 19.

02:56:52.412 --> 02:56:59.097
MATT: 19 hits. Or 19 damage, sorry. Whack! You
slam it again. This time it falls to the ground

02:56:59.097 --> 02:57:03.373
and picks itself back up, the flames brightening
once again, the anger as its jaw clacks open,

02:57:03.373 --> 02:57:05.559
coming towards your face.

02:57:05.559 --> 02:57:08.478
MARISHA: It's still alive? Kill it!

02:57:08.478 --> 02:57:10.557
TRAVIS: I don't have a third attack.

02:57:10.557 --> 02:57:11.924
MATT: Yeah, he's not frenzied.

02:57:11.924 --> 02:57:19.021
TRAVIS: With a bonus action, can I attempt to use
my Boots of Feral Leaping and leap...

02:57:19.021 --> 02:57:22.936
(laughter)

02:57:22.936 --> 02:57:26.461
TRAVIS: To the wall towards you. (yelps)

02:57:26.461 --> 02:57:30.988
TALIESIN: He senses the all-powerful deity to the
outside of it and just leaps towards Matt's face.

02:57:30.988 --> 02:57:34.508
TRAVIS: Damn you, watcher of all things!

02:57:34.508 --> 02:57:40.113
MATT: I'll just grab your mini and slam it into
the ground. No saves.

02:57:40.113 --> 02:57:43.436
TRAVIS: Flatline. Not like this.

02:57:43.436 --> 02:57:46.842
MATT: Not like this.

02:57:46.842 --> 02:57:49.556
TRAVIS: I just want to leap towards the wall that
way so I'm not in the same line.

02:57:49.556 --> 02:57:54.128
MATT: Okay, so go ahead and make your athletics
check. Since you are raging,

02:57:54.128 --> 02:57:55.307
you have advantage on it.

02:57:55.307 --> 02:57:57.733
TRAVIS: Oh, cool. I don't need it, it's 26.

02:57:57.733 --> 02:58:00.799
MATT: Okay, so you-- there you go.

02:58:00.799 --> 02:58:04.353
TRAVIS: I expected you to die!

02:58:04.353 --> 02:58:14.670
MATT: All right, this is Allura's turn. She sees,
currently at the moment, that the heavily damaged

02:58:14.670 --> 02:58:20.580
flame skull, and there's nothing else in the
immediate vicinity. She glances past, steps over

02:58:20.580 --> 02:58:25.893
past Kerrek, and says, "Shall you, or shall I?"

02:58:25.893 --> 02:58:30.184
PATRICK: Be my guest.

02:58:30.184 --> 02:58:35.790
MATT: "You're too kind." And with one hand on your
shoulder and her staff in the other, she thrusts

02:58:35.790 --> 02:58:44.580
it forward, and you watch as four what looks like
small beads of arcane energy go rocketing out from

02:58:44.580 --> 02:58:50.735
the top of the staff, and arcing around each
other, as they swell with power and force. All

02:58:50.735 --> 02:59:03.559
slam multiple times into the side, the Magic
Missiles dealing five, ten, 15-- four fours in a

02:59:03.559 --> 02:59:12.530
row-- 20. Four fours in a row. And that's not
quite enough to finish it.

02:59:12.530 --> 02:59:16.853
LAURA: How is this ghost so strong?

02:59:16.853 --> 02:59:23.350
MATT: It's taken 59 points of damage. You watch
as--

02:59:23.350 --> 02:59:25.842
TRAVIS: I forgot to add ten.

02:59:25.842 --> 02:59:29.397
MATT: To each roll? Well.

02:59:29.397 --> 02:59:31.219
TRAVIS: I mean, you can add 20.

02:59:31.219 --> 02:59:33.770
MATT: So we'll say, given that circumstance.

02:59:33.770 --> 02:59:36.748
TRAVIS: Sorry.

02:59:36.748 --> 02:59:41.896
MATT: It's okay. Given the fact that it literally
had one hit point left--

02:59:41.896 --> 02:59:43.404
TRAVIS: She got it!

02:59:43.404 --> 02:59:49.178
MATT: It had one hit point left! So as the four
missiles slam into the side of the skull, the

02:59:49.178 --> 02:59:53.993
final one hits, and its jaw gets blown off as the
rest of the skull just turns to ash against

02:59:53.993 --> 03:00:01.600
the stonework and slowly rests across the side,
the combat coming to an end in that moment.

03:00:01.600 --> 03:00:03.216
LAURA: Good times, guys!

03:00:03.216 --> 03:00:07.325
TALIESIN: Every week. Every week for two years.
We've been playing this game for two years.

03:00:07.325 --> 03:00:10.914
LIAM: It's gonna be amazing when we're level one
again, we'll go, I hit it for three points!

03:00:10.914 --> 03:00:13.969
(cheering)

03:00:13.969 --> 03:00:17.690
TRAVIS: We came from that way, right?

03:00:17.690 --> 03:00:18.889
MATT: You came from this way, yes.

03:00:18.889 --> 03:00:20.115
TRAVIS: Can I run that way?

03:00:20.115 --> 03:00:21.667
MATT: This way? Yeah.

03:00:21.667 --> 03:00:23.350
LIAM: This is a death trap, Grog, what are you
doing?

03:00:23.350 --> 03:00:25.362
MARISHA: Why are you running backwards?

03:00:25.362 --> 03:00:27.218
TRAVIS: We came from the other way.

03:00:27.218 --> 03:00:29.277
MATT: You went this way.

03:00:29.277 --> 03:00:30.447
TRAVIS: I run the other way.

03:00:30.447 --> 03:00:34.015
MATT: Okay, so Grog just goes bolting through,
past all of you guys,

03:00:34.015 --> 03:00:35.787
into the currently unexplored--

03:00:35.787 --> 03:00:39.366
LIAM: I start flying with him. Grog, Grog, Grog,
we don't know if everything has been fucked up,

03:00:39.366 --> 03:00:41.000
will you just wait a second?

03:00:41.000 --> 03:00:42.405
LAURA: Check for traps, check for traps!

03:00:42.405 --> 03:00:44.407
TRAVIS: (braking noises)

03:00:44.407 --> 03:00:46.011
TALIESIN: At the edge of the map?

03:00:46.011 --> 03:00:48.297
LIAM: Wow. You're learning.

03:00:48.297 --> 03:00:54.831
MATT: You just caught him as he moved past the
partially collapsed part of the wall where the one

03:00:54.831 --> 03:00:56.163
skull was trying to hide.

03:00:56.163 --> 03:01:02.793
MARISHA: Pike. Do we have maybe like a group heal,
'cause I'm half hit points

03:01:02.793 --> 03:01:07.434
after flaming Night Riders.

03:01:07.434 --> 03:01:08.952
LAURA: Yeah.

03:01:08.952 --> 03:01:14.051
LIAM: I'm gonna check for traps past where the
gate was. 20 or 30 feet.

03:01:14.051 --> 03:01:16.767
LAURA: Some sort of healing thing.

03:01:16.767 --> 03:01:18.450
TRAVIS: How many of those did you fail?

03:01:18.450 --> 03:01:21.389
MARISHA: I passed all of them, one with a nat 20.

03:01:21.389 --> 03:01:23.645
TRAVIS: Oh. You're at half your hit points?

03:01:23.645 --> 03:01:27.086
MARISHA: Look, man, we can't all be Grog the
barbarian.

03:01:27.086 --> 03:01:35.103
LAURA: Do we wanna-- okay, if we all keep charging
in, that spell that we just did lasts for a

03:01:35.103 --> 03:01:43.016
minute. Thought Raishan was around. She was not.
So, we've got less than a minute left on that

03:01:43.016 --> 03:01:44.165
level eight there.

03:01:44.165 --> 03:01:47.486
MARISHA: That gives us advantage on all saving
throws?

03:01:47.486 --> 03:01:52.168
MATT: Which, actually, now that I think about it,
I need you to roll four concentration checks on

03:01:52.168 --> 03:01:56.047
that one for Pike. So four constitution saving
throws.

03:01:56.047 --> 03:01:59.876
LAURA: You know what, they did a good job of
keeping us from all dying just then, though.

03:01:59.876 --> 03:02:03.781
LIAM: Yes, they did, yes, that was not wasted
advantage. Here we go.

03:02:03.781 --> 03:02:11.273
LAURA: Natural 20, 18, 19, 11. 11.

03:02:11.273 --> 03:02:13.531
PATRICK: Actually, that 11 had plus three.

03:02:13.531 --> 03:02:22.797
MATT: Yeah. Okay, so she maintains concentration,
but you have roughly 50 seconds, 45 seconds.

03:02:22.797 --> 03:02:25.111
LIAM: Let's go right now, right now.

03:02:25.111 --> 03:02:27.231
LAURA: We're not gonna be able to get to her in a
minute, y'all.

03:02:27.231 --> 03:02:28.990
LIAM: Is there anything ahead of me as I look with
my 19?

03:02:28.990 --> 03:02:31.474
MATT: Okay, so as they're having this
conversation, you push past, you don't notice

03:02:31.474 --> 03:02:39.105
anything trapped, but about 30 feet from where the
iron door was, as you're scoping, the floor just

03:02:39.105 --> 03:02:43.994
turns to darkness, and as you peek over, you see
now a set of stairs are descending.

03:02:43.994 --> 03:02:46.433
LIAM: But no traps?

03:02:46.433 --> 03:02:48.322
MATT: No traps.

03:02:48.322 --> 03:02:50.895
LIAM: Do we want to keep moving, or do we want to
pause?

03:02:50.895 --> 03:02:53.880
LAURA: If we take a rest, we can rest up and
heal.

03:02:53.880 --> 03:02:56.194
PATRICK: I would like to have a short rest right
now so we can top off.

03:02:56.194 --> 03:02:59.364
LIAM: Okay. Let the spell go, then. Hit dice.

03:02:59.364 --> 03:03:03.730
LAURA: Okay, yeah. We use our hit dice, 'cause we
all got half of them back.

03:03:03.730 --> 03:03:06.545
MARISHA: How long, short rest?

03:03:06.545 --> 03:03:10.004
MATT: Short rest is about anywhere from 30 minutes
to an hour.

03:03:10.004 --> 03:03:14.971
LAURA: We can scry and see if Raishan totally
knows that we're here.

03:03:14.971 --> 03:03:20.712
PATRICK: Unless there's some sort of big healing
mojo, but I am really gimped.

03:03:20.712 --> 03:03:25.071
TRAVIS: Yeah, let's just use our hit dice, save
the big heals.

03:03:25.071 --> 03:03:27.244
MARISHA: I mean, I could burn a Mass Cure Wounds
and heal us.

03:03:27.244 --> 03:03:29.519
TRAVIS: We haven't even fought the dragon yet.

03:03:29.519 --> 03:03:30.926
LAURA: Yeah, that's the thing.

03:03:30.926 --> 03:03:34.075
LIAM: For all we know, we fucked ourselves with
that skull earlier.

03:03:34.075 --> 03:03:36.785
TALIESIN: So it wouldn't matter. So what's 40
minutes.

03:03:36.785 --> 03:03:39.509
MARISHA: I don't know, I feel like that was gonna
happen.

03:03:39.509 --> 03:03:41.741
TALIESIN: Yeah, we're good. Let's take a--

03:03:41.741 --> 03:03:44.980
MARISHA: She's a smart woman. The least that we
can assume is that she knows.

03:03:44.980 --> 03:03:46.605
LIAM: We haven't outsmarted her yet.

03:03:46.605 --> 03:03:48.154
LAURA: She's probably already bamfed out, y'all.

03:03:48.154 --> 03:03:50.434
TALIESIN: You can find out really easily.

03:03:50.434 --> 03:03:55.178
LAURA: Oh. Yeah, while we're resting, I'm gonna
detect dragons and see if she's still around.

03:03:55.178 --> 03:04:02.379
MATT: Okay. You sense the same three dragon
presences in the vicinity.

03:04:02.379 --> 03:04:07.593
LAURA: Same spot? Oh, all right.

03:04:07.593 --> 03:04:11.310
MARISHA: That's something.

03:04:11.310 --> 03:04:14.446
LIAM: (whispers) Tell us all your secrets.

03:04:14.446 --> 03:04:19.037
TRAVIS: Nine times a day, playa.

03:04:19.037 --> 03:04:23.084
MATT: Don't forget, you guys using your hit dice,
you get Scanlan's Song of Rest.

03:04:23.084 --> 03:04:25.161
LAURA: Okay, so what is that?

03:04:25.161 --> 03:04:27.582
MATT: It's an additional d12.

03:04:27.582 --> 03:04:30.507
MARISHA: Song of Rest is 1d12 healing points.

03:04:30.507 --> 03:04:32.649
TALIESIN: On top of?

03:04:32.649 --> 03:04:35.571
MATT: On top of whatever you healed, you then get
an additional d12.

03:04:35.571 --> 03:04:37.674
TRAVIS: I got a 12 right there, that's fucking
sweet.

03:04:37.674 --> 03:04:47.353
MARISHA: Plus 12? Plus 1d8 plus? Sorry. Plus 1d12,
right? He adds a 1d12.

03:04:47.353 --> 03:04:50.279
TALIESIN: Nine.

03:04:50.279 --> 03:04:55.818
MATT: That's overall, not on each dice, yeah. Just
overall.

03:04:55.818 --> 03:04:58.314
MARISHA: Hit dice.

03:04:58.314 --> 03:05:07.844
TRAVIS: Do we go back up to Heroes' Feast hit
points, or not anymore?

03:05:07.844 --> 03:05:11.610
MATT: Yeah. Heroes' Feast is addition to your
maximum hit points.

03:05:11.610 --> 03:05:14.111
TRAVIS: I heal 55 hit points with this d12
monster.

03:05:14.111 --> 03:05:15.698
LAURA: Oh my god, I rolled so good.

03:05:15.698 --> 03:05:19.186
TRAVIS: I'm just one below where I was.

03:05:19.186 --> 03:05:20.557
MATT: Which is what?

03:05:20.557 --> 03:05:21.924
TRAVIS: 235.

03:05:21.924 --> 03:05:23.575
MATT: 235 for Grog. Percy, where are you at?

03:05:23.575 --> 03:05:24.946
TALIESIN: I'm still rolling.

03:05:24.946 --> 03:05:32.789
LAURA: I went all the way back to my maximum, so
115 is what I'm at now.

03:05:32.789 --> 03:05:35.776
MATT: Okay. Vax, you didn't take any damage.
Kerrek, what are you at?

03:05:35.776 --> 03:05:37.571
PATRICK: Still rolling.

03:05:37.571 --> 03:05:38.925
MATT: Okay, no worries.

03:05:38.925 --> 03:05:48.562
TALIESIN: I'm rolling really shittily.

03:05:48.562 --> 03:05:51.187
MARISHA: I'm not doing great.

03:05:51.187 --> 03:05:52.550
LIAM: Scanlan helped out with that?

03:05:52.550 --> 03:05:53.970
MATT: He did, yeah.

03:05:53.970 --> 03:06:03.812
LIAM: (sings) When the Blight has come, and the
land is dark, and your health is down to 23 HP.

03:06:03.812 --> 03:06:07.359
TRAVIS: Oh, you're doing great! That's great.

03:06:07.359 --> 03:06:10.098
LAURA: That was good.

03:06:10.098 --> 03:06:12.370
TRAVIS: We're missing the high soprano tonal
quality.

03:06:12.370 --> 03:06:13.997
LIAM: Can't do it, can't do it.

03:06:13.997 --> 03:06:15.718
TALIESIN: Wow, I'm down a lot.

03:06:15.718 --> 03:06:20.236
MARISHA: I'm gonna burn my last few hit dice.

03:06:20.236 --> 03:06:25.147
TALIESIN: I'm at 140, I'm not at the top of my
peak.

03:06:25.147 --> 03:06:27.007
MARISHA: I'm at 95.

03:06:27.007 --> 03:06:28.393
MATT: 95, got it.

03:06:28.393 --> 03:06:33.912
TALIESIN: Is it possible-- god, I have
instructions on how to run Scanlan, and I'm

03:06:33.912 --> 03:06:35.558
debating how to best do that.

03:06:35.558 --> 03:06:39.888
LAURA: Oh, I went up to 117, because I forgot I
had the extra 15.

03:06:39.888 --> 03:06:43.108
MATT: Heroes' Feast, yeah.

03:06:43.108 --> 03:06:47.772
LIAM: Is he going to do a bump or a thing?

03:06:47.772 --> 03:06:50.640
MARISHA: Would he do a bump right now? He probably
would, wouldn't he?

03:06:50.640 --> 03:06:52.820
TALIESIN: I was going to say, according to the
instructions I was given--

03:06:52.820 --> 03:06:54.171
MARISHA: Probably.

03:06:54.171 --> 03:06:57.837
LAURA: Pike's back at 115.

03:06:57.837 --> 03:07:01.495
TALIESIN: Well, that's the thing, I want to make
sure I can do this in a way so I don't take

03:07:01.495 --> 03:07:03.548
anything from him later.

03:07:03.548 --> 03:07:08.795
MARISHA: Is he-- wait, hang on, wait, I feel like
he texted. No, he didn't.

03:07:08.795 --> 03:07:13.148
TALIESIN: He really-- yeah, no, I'm gonna try--

03:07:13.148 --> 03:07:15.117
TRAVIS: A number, give him a number.

03:07:15.117 --> 03:07:17.553
MARISHA: Hang on. How many bumps of suude does he
have left?

03:07:17.553 --> 03:07:18.559
MATT: One.

03:07:18.559 --> 03:07:20.038
TRAVIS: Save it.

03:07:20.038 --> 03:07:23.258
MARISHA: Would he do it for after Raishan or
before?

03:07:23.258 --> 03:07:24.302
TRAVIS: After.

03:07:24.302 --> 03:07:25.561
TALIESIN: Before.

03:07:25.561 --> 03:07:28.465
LIAM: Before, I think, too.

03:07:28.465 --> 03:07:31.164
TALIESIN: Yeah, I was given specific
instructions.

03:07:31.164 --> 03:07:33.401
MARISHA: I think he would do it before, too.

03:07:33.401 --> 03:07:38.005
TALIESIN: He's gonna push a little forward, up to
the stairs, get away from the rest of the group.

03:07:38.208 --> 03:07:41.335
MATT: That'll be going up to where Vax is.

03:07:41.335 --> 03:07:44.272
TALIESIN: Oh, then he's going to push a little far
back and just--

03:07:44.272 --> 03:07:46.092
MATT: Okay, so Scanlan backs away.

03:07:46.092 --> 03:07:48.685
LAURA: Wait, Scanlan gave us an extra nine hit
points?

03:07:48.685 --> 03:07:49.766
MATT: Extra d12.

03:07:49.766 --> 03:07:51.790
TALIESIN: Which is nine hit points.

03:07:51.790 --> 03:07:59.596
LAURA: Nine. I'm higher than 117, then I'm
one-whatever. 126.

03:07:59.596 --> 03:08:01.813
MARISHA: So he has one hit of suude left?

03:08:01.813 --> 03:08:06.382
TALIESIN: Yeah, he's gonna get himself quietly
away. I think he's had it packed already, so

03:08:06.382 --> 03:08:08.460
there's not gonna be a big, elaborate-- he's just
gonna--

03:08:08.460 --> 03:08:11.025
MARISHA: Holy shit, this feels so weird.

03:08:11.025 --> 03:08:15.946
MATT: To by-proxy do this? Yeah. Okay.

03:08:15.946 --> 03:08:17.733
MARISHA: It feels so dirty.

03:08:17.733 --> 03:08:19.800
MATT: Go ahead and roll a constitution saving
throw.

03:08:19.800 --> 03:08:25.940
TALIESIN: I'm not gonna sully it with my good
dice, I'm gonna use one of my crappy dice.

03:08:25.940 --> 03:08:28.100
MARISHA: He gave us instructions.

03:08:28.100 --> 03:08:31.683
TALIESIN: This is, I guess, the most stoner die I
have for this.

03:08:31.683 --> 03:08:37.718
So okay, constitution saving throw?

03:08:37.718 --> 03:08:40.140
MARISHA: Come on. Just straight constitution?

03:08:40.140 --> 03:08:42.680
TALIESIN: 19. Oh, saving throw. 19.

03:08:42.680 --> 03:08:52.927
MATT: 19, all right, great. As Scanlan takes the
flute and takes in the fumes of the char-burned

03:08:52.927 --> 03:09:03.020
suude, the familiar burn and chemical flavor fills
his lungs, and as he exhales, this fine brown

03:09:03.020 --> 03:09:09.792
smoke emits from his lungs, and his vision
clarifies suddenly, and he feels this elevated

03:09:09.792 --> 03:09:18.308
sense of energy and power in his mind. For the
next hour, Scanlan has one sorcery point that he

03:09:18.308 --> 03:09:26.291
can spend as the sorcerer metamagic class, and has
access to the extended spell Metamagic ability.

03:09:26.291 --> 03:09:29.476
LIAM: Do you know what that means? I kind of do.

03:09:29.476 --> 03:09:34.275
MARISHA: Okay, unextended spell Metamagic? So what
does that buy us?

03:09:34.275 --> 03:09:38.965
MATT: So he has one point, period, that he can
ever spend for the next hour.

03:09:38.965 --> 03:09:40.532
MARISHA: He has one sorcery point.

03:09:40.532 --> 03:09:41.735
MATT: Correct.

03:09:41.735 --> 03:09:46.599
MARISHA: Wait, how do you spell sorcery? How do
you spell sorcery?

03:09:46.599 --> 03:09:57.021
MATT: And basically, he can spend it to double the
duration of a spell as he casts it.

03:09:57.021 --> 03:09:59.217
MARISHA: He can double--

03:09:59.217 --> 03:10:01.935
LIAM: That's the only thing that's within reach of
one sorcery point, right?

03:10:01.935 --> 03:10:09.086
MATT: That's-- the suude gives him access to a
specific metamagic based on the color of the

03:10:09.086 --> 03:10:14.485
suude, and he gets a point. The more you use to
get more points, the higher the DC gets, and the

03:10:14.485 --> 03:10:16.429
closer you get to overdosing.

03:10:16.429 --> 03:10:19.438
TALIESIN: Ah, I love it! This is the worst thing
ever!

03:10:19.438 --> 03:10:21.258
MARISHA: So he could theoretically die by doing
this.

03:10:21.258 --> 03:10:23.497
LIAM: Hey, man, it's just another version of
Craven Edge.

03:10:23.497 --> 03:10:26.857
TALIESIN: No, it's great, yeah. This is weirdly--

03:10:26.857 --> 03:10:29.055
TRAVIS: Yeah, except I had it all under control.

03:10:29.055 --> 03:10:30.306
LAURA: Sure.

03:10:30.306 --> 03:10:33.912
MARISHA: So wait, he can double the length of one
spell.

03:10:33.912 --> 03:10:39.841
MATT: Yeah, a single spell that has a duration, he
can use that sorcery point to double the duration

03:10:39.841 --> 03:10:40.959
of that spell.

03:10:40.959 --> 03:10:42.465
MARISHA: The duration of one spell.

03:10:42.465 --> 03:10:43.300
MATT: Correct.

03:10:43.300 --> 03:10:45.372
MARISHA: And it could be-- wait, question.

03:10:45.372 --> 03:10:48.017
MATT: So if it's one minute concentration, it can
be two minutes concentration.

03:10:48.017 --> 03:10:50.630
MARISHA: What if it's one action? Could it be two
actions? He could do it back to back?

03:10:50.630 --> 03:10:56.179
MATT: No. The duration, not the casting time.
Those are different. The duration is once you cast

03:10:56.179 --> 03:10:57.949
it, how long it lasts before it expires.

03:10:57.949 --> 03:11:03.107
LAURA: So like a mansion we could have for two
days.

03:11:03.107 --> 03:11:05.081
TALIESIN: Two-day mansion!

03:11:05.081 --> 03:11:13.148
MATT: Actually, no, it says specifically as part
of the metamagic ability that it has a maximum of

03:11:13.148 --> 03:11:16.612
24 hours. So if it already has a 24 hour duration,
you cannot.

03:11:16.612 --> 03:11:18.323
LAURA: Just kidding.

03:11:18.323 --> 03:11:20.879
MARISHA: So only if it's below 24 hours.

03:11:20.879 --> 03:11:24.205
TALIESIN: The large print giveth and the small
print taketh away.

03:11:24.205 --> 03:11:28.092
(laughter)

03:11:28.092 --> 03:11:29.552
MATT: That's a beautiful quote.

03:11:29.552 --> 03:11:32.497
TALIESIN: Tom Waits, everybody. Tom Waits, bless
him.

03:11:32.497 --> 03:11:35.378
LIAM: (Tom Waits voice) What's Percy building in
there?

03:11:35.378 --> 03:11:38.769
TRAVIS: Patrick, how much did you heal, brother?

03:11:38.769 --> 03:11:41.400
PATRICK: I'm up to 94.

03:11:41.400 --> 03:11:42.860
MATT: All righty.

03:11:42.860 --> 03:11:44.678
TALIESIN: I dig this. We got this.

03:11:44.678 --> 03:11:50.271
MARISHA: One sorcery, double, okay. All right, all
right. Holy shit.

03:11:50.271 --> 03:11:55.659
LIAM: I found nothing in the further area, right?

03:11:55.659 --> 03:11:59.754
MATT: No traps. You came to the edge of the stairs
that lead down for about 20 or so feet, and then

03:11:59.754 --> 03:12:05.924
progress an even path, and then disappear below
what your visual is able to see from above.

03:12:05.924 --> 03:12:09.242
MARISHA: Keyleth is going to just, before this
short rest, is going to

03:12:09.242 --> 03:12:11.031
give one Cure Wounds to herself.

03:12:11.031 --> 03:12:12.543
MATT: Okay, go for it.

03:12:12.543 --> 03:12:13.899
MARISHA: Just to top me off.

03:12:13.899 --> 03:12:15.856
LIAM: Kerr, is your hammer still aglow?

03:12:15.856 --> 03:12:19.231
PATRICK: If you want light, I can do light.

03:12:19.231 --> 03:12:22.383
LIAM: I wanna know if it's aglow right now. Did
you have a chance to pop it out?

03:12:22.383 --> 03:12:26.067
PATRICK: It probably is unless somebody told me to
turn it off.

03:12:26.067 --> 03:12:29.812
LIAM: Okay. So I figured it was probably still
on.

03:12:29.812 --> 03:12:33.023
MATT: Yeah, it's still currently being the central
source of light in this room.

03:12:33.023 --> 03:12:35.378
LIAM: How far down the stairs do I see from where
I am?

03:12:35.378 --> 03:12:41.149
MATT: From where you are, you can see all the way
to the bottom of the 20 feet of stairs, but the

03:12:41.149 --> 03:12:45.692
roof of the tunnel cuts off the rest of the path,
so you have to go out further

03:12:45.692 --> 03:12:47.350
to look out where it goes.

03:12:47.350 --> 03:12:49.519
MARISHA: Keyleth is at 116 hit points.

03:12:49.519 --> 03:12:50.726
MATT: Cool, got it.

03:12:50.726 --> 03:12:52.358
LIAM: Put that out, please, Kerr?

03:12:52.358 --> 03:12:53.759
PATRICK: Okay, I snuff it.

03:12:53.759 --> 03:12:58.675
LIAM: I'm gonna go stealth, and I'm gonna go down
to the bottom of the steps. And I've already

03:12:58.675 --> 03:13:03.157
checked for traps-- oh no, I didn't, up to this
point, so I'm gonna check for traps as I go down

03:13:03.157 --> 03:13:03.975
the steps.

03:13:03.975 --> 03:13:05.566
MATT: Okay, stealth first.

03:13:05.566 --> 03:13:08.871
LIAM: Which is 25. Am I still under Pass Without a
Trace?

03:13:08.871 --> 03:13:10.300
MATT: No, because she cast--

03:13:10.300 --> 03:13:11.233
LIAM: 25.

03:13:11.233 --> 03:13:13.920
MATT: 25, okay. And then make an investigation
check.

03:13:13.920 --> 03:13:15.303
LIAM: Natural 20 for that.

03:13:15.303 --> 03:13:24.173
MATT: You make your way down the stairs into the
next bit of the hallway. No traps. The stonework

03:13:24.173 --> 03:13:32.602
here now is getting a little more refined the
further you go, and as you look out the hallway,

03:13:32.602 --> 03:13:41.836
you have another 25, 30 feet of this 20-foot-wide,
20-foot-tall hallway before it seems to just end

03:13:41.836 --> 03:13:47.187
and drop off. And you can see what looks to be the
gap in another wall

03:13:47.187 --> 03:13:49.257
about 25 feet across from that.

03:13:49.257 --> 03:13:55.758
LIAM: Okay. So hallway goes a ways, then there's
nothing, and then 20 feet past that--

03:13:55.758 --> 03:13:58.330
MATT: And then just a wall on the other side.

03:13:58.330 --> 03:14:00.531
LIAM: So a gap and then a wall?

03:14:00.531 --> 03:14:03.686
MATT: Yeah, looks like it goes down or up. You'd
have to get closer to get more detail.

03:14:03.686 --> 03:14:06.913
TALIESIN: I keep meaning to build something for
something like this. I just haven't had the time.

03:14:06.913 --> 03:14:10.712
LAURA: Oh, you know what, darling, don't worry.
You can use the carpet.

03:14:10.712 --> 03:14:20.061
LIAM: On the earring: team, there's a passage down
ahead of me. There's no traps, I don't think.

03:14:20.061 --> 03:14:21.452
LAURA: So let's walk up there.

03:14:21.452 --> 03:14:26.760
LIAM: Yeah, catch up with me and then pause, and
then either I or my sister and I will move ahead?

03:14:26.760 --> 03:14:31.854
TALIESIN: And just let us know which direction you
think we should head, Vex.

03:14:31.854 --> 03:14:35.410
LAURA: Of course.

03:14:35.410 --> 03:14:39.740
LIAM: Did you mean Vax or did you mean Vex? Just
want to be really sure. Because people make

03:14:39.740 --> 03:14:41.159
mistakes a lot.

03:14:41.159 --> 03:14:42.285
LAURA: They do, they really do.

03:14:42.285 --> 03:14:45.448
TALIESIN: I do, I know I do. That wasn't a
mistake, though.

03:14:45.659 --> 03:14:46.435
LIAM: Very similar.

03:14:46.435 --> 03:14:47.596
TALIESIN: Love you madly.

03:14:47.596 --> 03:14:49.409
LIAM: All right. I know you're talking to Vax.

03:14:49.409 --> 03:14:51.165
TALIESIN: That was for Vex. Vax. Which one?

03:14:51.165 --> 03:14:53.494
MATT: Trinket can use his own hit dice to heal, if
you wanted to.

03:14:53.494 --> 03:14:59.485
LAURA: Okay, then he healed himself while we were
rested, but he's in the necklace so that we can

03:14:59.485 --> 03:15:01.105
fly if we have to.

03:15:01.105 --> 03:15:05.344
MATT: That's fine. Okay, so yeah, you can go ahead
and heal him up. Vax, you move ahead?

03:15:05.344 --> 03:15:06.307
LIAM: Yeah.

03:15:06.307 --> 03:15:09.133
MATT: Okay, as they start catching up with you,
you hear them stepping down the stairs behind you,

03:15:09.133 --> 03:15:15.302
you come up to the edge, and now what you see is a
25-foot circular almost cylinder. There is a

03:15:15.302 --> 03:15:20.766
ceiling maybe about five feet above you, and
nothing there, but what you do see is about a

03:15:20.766 --> 03:15:29.471
three-foot-wide spiral staircase that just leads
down and down and down. And you cannot see where

03:15:29.471 --> 03:15:30.888
it ends at the bottom.

03:15:30.888 --> 03:15:36.234
LIAM: Is it a staircase where I'm forced to walk,
or is it stairs on the walls and empty space down

03:15:36.234 --> 03:15:37.422
the center of it?

03:15:37.422 --> 03:15:41.396
MATT: Empty space down the center of it, and it's
just a two-and-a-half- or three-foot-wide

03:15:41.396 --> 03:15:44.547
staircase that goes along the edge, and that's all
you have to walk on.

03:15:44.547 --> 03:15:49.567
LIAM: Ah. I'm going to float out above it and look
for traps down the cylinder.

03:15:49.567 --> 03:15:51.103
MATT: Okay.

03:15:51.103 --> 03:15:54.974
TALIESIN: Why don't you tie the endless rope to
yourself so we can pull you up--

03:15:54.974 --> 03:15:56.807
LIAM: I've got wings.

03:15:56.807 --> 03:16:00.515
LAURA: But they're only out for an hour, dear.

03:16:00.515 --> 03:16:01.704
LIAM: 18.

03:16:01.704 --> 03:16:10.428
MATT: 18, okay. As you slowly drift down, keeping
your wings, you hover further down, maybe

03:16:10.428 --> 03:16:14.240
incrementally ten feet at a time, looking around,
looking at the stairs. You don't notice anything

03:16:14.240 --> 03:16:19.918
trapped. It all seems pretty standard. The stones
are old, they're a little smooth at the edges,

03:16:19.918 --> 03:16:27.599
what were once kind of very, very rigid and square
protrusions from the stone seemingly have a little

03:16:27.599 --> 03:16:28.776
rubbed off.

03:16:28.776 --> 03:16:31.182
LIAM: At or near the bottom, doorway, passage?

03:16:31.182 --> 03:16:37.563
MATT: As you get closer to the bottom, and as you
get about roughly 100 feet down before you

03:16:37.563 --> 03:16:42.737
actually reach the bottom, but you begin to see
below you, there are, right in the center of the

03:16:42.737 --> 03:16:55.912
spiral downward, a cluster of four-foot-long kind
of deep brown or maroon-colored iron spikes that

03:16:55.912 --> 03:17:05.578
are all just jutting upward in slightly off-kilter
directions, and there is a very, very heavy pile

03:17:05.578 --> 03:17:11.602
of splintered bones and long-mummified dead
corpses that are currently just piled up at the

03:17:11.602 --> 03:17:17.449
base of these spikes, some still impaled, many of
which have slowly rotted and fallen apart.

03:17:17.449 --> 03:17:23.533
LIAM: Over the earring, I didn't see any traps
going down, but there's some bloody spikes down

03:17:23.533 --> 03:17:30.754
here and some dead things, so Vex, dear, could you
load everyone onto the carpet and get on your

03:17:30.754 --> 03:17:35.051
broom and go down and just float down to the
center and leave the stairs alone?

03:17:35.051 --> 03:17:39.490
LAURA: Of course. The carpet can fit everybody.

03:17:39.490 --> 03:17:47.159
MATT: The carpet can carry 600 pounds. That's
roughly four people, or a Grog. 800 pounds.

03:17:47.159 --> 03:17:49.605
LAURA: Grog and one person.

03:17:49.605 --> 03:17:52.074
TRAVIS: I'm more than 450, so.

03:17:52.074 --> 03:17:53.890
MATT: Grog and maybe two people.

03:17:53.890 --> 03:17:56.173
LAURA: So I can get Scanlan--

03:17:56.173 --> 03:17:59.241
MATT: You currently have ten people traveling with
you.

03:17:59.241 --> 03:18:03.668
TALIESIN: So here's an interesting thing. We don't
have an immovable bar anymore, we left those both

03:18:03.668 --> 03:18:08.422
outside. All right, that's fine. Let's--

03:18:08.422 --> 03:18:11.905
LAURA: What's at the bottom of the stairs? I mean,
can we drop people off and go back in?

03:18:11.905 --> 03:18:15.912
LIAM: Yeah, yeah, yeah, I can come up for Pike,
bring her down, we could just take a minute to--

03:18:15.912 --> 03:18:18.569
TALIESIN: We could shuttle or use a rope.

03:18:18.569 --> 03:18:20.992
LAURA: Let's shuttle-bus.

03:18:20.992 --> 03:18:26.276
LIAM: And what around the spikes, is there a safe
portion on the floor?

03:18:26.276 --> 03:18:27.975
LAURA: A safe landing?

03:18:27.975 --> 03:18:34.213
MATT: There is a very, very-- kind of where the
outer trim is of the stairway, the stonework

03:18:34.213 --> 03:18:40.676
travels around it, and then underneath the
stairway there is a small opening that leads into

03:18:40.676 --> 03:18:42.073
a further passageway.

03:18:42.073 --> 03:18:44.519
LAURA: Is it safe to walk into the passageway?

03:18:44.519 --> 03:18:46.734
TRAVIS: Pretty sure we should just take the
stairs.

03:18:46.734 --> 03:18:50.408
LAURA: Pretty sure we should just use the brazier
and light it.

03:18:50.408 --> 03:18:52.911
TALIESIN: I will avoid cardio at all costs.

03:18:52.911 --> 03:18:56.040
LIAM: 22 investigating for traps for that passage
down behind the spikes.

03:18:56.040 --> 03:18:59.669
MATT: Okay. I mean, just glancing around the
archway, it's not a closed doorway, just an

03:18:59.669 --> 03:19:04.492
archway, and then a dark tunnel beyond that, it
does not appear to be trapped.

03:19:04.492 --> 03:19:09.728
LIAM: All right. Best I can tell, it's okay. I'm
not 100% sure, but there's dead people down here,

03:19:09.728 --> 03:19:11.876
so I just want you guys to float down the middle,
let's get this done.

03:19:11.876 --> 03:19:13.174
TALIESIN: Grog first?

03:19:13.174 --> 03:19:15.271
LIAM: 'kay.

03:19:15.271 --> 03:19:17.983
TRAVIS: I'm game.

03:19:17.983 --> 03:19:21.203
LAURA: I'm gonna grab Scanlan on the broom. You
grab Pike.

03:19:21.203 --> 03:19:22.517
LIAM: I'm shooting up, yeah.

03:19:22.517 --> 03:19:26.463
LAURA: Okay, and then we'll take the gnomes and
Grog down and then come back up.

03:19:26.463 --> 03:19:29.093
LIAM: I kinda wanna move as fast as we can.

03:19:29.093 --> 03:19:34.952
MATT: Okay, so who's doing what? Okay, you guys
just threw a bunch of stuff at me right now.

03:19:34.952 --> 03:19:36.090
LIAM: I flew back up.

03:19:36.090 --> 03:19:37.319
MATT: You flew back up.

03:19:37.319 --> 03:19:38.484
LIAM: We take the gnomes down.

03:19:38.484 --> 03:19:42.986
LAURA: Yeah, I've got-- I want Pike on my broom.

03:19:42.986 --> 03:19:48.094
LIAM: I take my little drug-addled buddy, not that
I know that, and I float him down, and I plant the

03:19:48.094 --> 03:19:49.836
gnomes down together.

03:19:49.836 --> 03:19:56.101
MATT: Okay, so you have Scanlan, you have Pike.
Okay. You guys enter the center area and begin

03:19:56.101 --> 03:20:04.163
coasting downward. You notice a faint blue glow
above you in the ceiling. As you glance up, you

03:20:04.163 --> 03:20:07.257
watch as a glyph begins to slowly--

03:20:07.257 --> 03:20:08.986
TALIESIN: Dispel Magic.

03:20:08.986 --> 03:20:16.075
MATT: Dispel Magic from Scanlan right now? Okay,
have Scanlan go ahead and roll an ability check.

03:20:16.075 --> 03:20:20.824
TALIESIN: Ability check? Okay, I will admit, I
have no idea what I'm doing.

03:20:20.824 --> 03:20:25.149
MATT: For this, 'cause he can't cast as a
reaction, and this would technically be your

03:20:25.149 --> 03:20:29.254
reaction, as it's already been triggered, I wanna
have you go ahead and roll an initiative check.

03:20:29.254 --> 03:20:31.038
MARISHA: Is this a spell attack bonus?

03:20:31.038 --> 03:20:32.219
MATT: Huh?

03:20:32.219 --> 03:20:35.287
MARISHA: What? What ability check?

03:20:35.287 --> 03:20:40.992
MATT: This would be a charisma, plus six and plus
two. It's plus eight to whatever you roll, but

03:20:40.992 --> 03:20:47.018
first, I need you to go ahead and roll initiative.
Technically you would not be able to do this as

03:20:47.018 --> 03:20:48.576
it's not really a reaction.

03:20:48.576 --> 03:20:50.937
MARISHA: His charisma plus his proficiency bonus.

03:20:50.937 --> 03:20:59.319
MATT: Not for the ability check on Dispel Magic.
19? That's 17. So yes. Go ahead and roll a d20 and

03:20:59.319 --> 03:21:00.506
add eight.

03:21:00.506 --> 03:21:06.596
MARISHA: Big money, no whammies.

03:21:06.596 --> 03:21:08.940
TALIESIN: 21.

03:21:08.940 --> 03:21:14.884
MATT: 21, okay. As he streaks upward and releases
the spell, you watch as the glyph that was

03:21:14.884 --> 03:21:16.319
glowing--

03:21:16.319 --> 03:21:25.627
TALIESIN: (sings) Rock glyph! You don't have to
turn on the blue light. Rock glyph! You don't have

03:21:25.627 --> 03:21:32.250
to give our bodies to the spikes. Love you, Sam.
Love you.

03:21:32.250 --> 03:21:34.144
TRAVIS: That was good!

03:21:34.144 --> 03:21:38.956
MARISHA: That was good, get some Police up in
here.

03:21:38.956 --> 03:21:44.831
TALIESIN: Brought it all the way back for you.

03:21:44.831 --> 03:21:50.966
MATT: So. You guys manage to continue all the way
downward, flying, you place both of the gnomes at

03:21:50.966 --> 03:21:52.990
the base, safely by the spikes.

03:21:52.990 --> 03:21:58.065
LIAM: Oh man, I plant him down, I give him a big
fat kiss right between the eyes, you fucking

03:21:58.065 --> 03:21:59.664
beautiful bastard! Whack!

03:21:59.664 --> 03:22:01.702
LAURA: What was that? What was that? Sam?
Scanlan?

03:22:01.702 --> 03:22:03.604
TALIESIN: I have no idea. It just looked
dangerous, and I figured

03:22:03.604 --> 03:22:05.511
that's better safe than sorry.

03:22:05.511 --> 03:22:07.764
LAURA: Do you think it's broken now? Can we get
other people from--

03:22:07.764 --> 03:22:09.191
TALIESIN: Sure, they'll be fine.

03:22:09.191 --> 03:22:15.083
LIAM: I fly back up right away. Keep this train
moving.

03:22:15.083 --> 03:22:17.644
TRAVIS: On the carpet? I'm ready?

03:22:17.644 --> 03:22:19.091
LIAM: I bring Kima down.

03:22:19.091 --> 03:22:21.738
LAURA: Grog and Allura can fit on the carpet,
right?

03:22:21.738 --> 03:22:24.278
TRAVIS: Just me, I think.

03:22:24.278 --> 03:22:26.189
LIAM: She's wafer-thin.

03:22:26.189 --> 03:22:33.088
TRAVIS: What do you think? Me and Allura, or just
me?

03:22:33.088 --> 03:22:34.925
MATT: You and one other person could probably get
on.

03:22:34.925 --> 03:22:39.858
LAURA: Okay, then, oh god. Maybe, could you take, 
when you fly back up--

03:22:39.858 --> 03:22:42.357
TALIESIN: I'll go with you, 'cause I'm fine. So I
have options.

03:22:42.704 --> 03:22:45.154
LIAM: Is Kima down?

03:22:45.154 --> 03:22:48.165
MATT: You go ahead and begin to carry Kima down
without an issue, yeah.

03:22:48.165 --> 03:22:54.582
LAURA: Okay, I go back up and get Percy. We have
Kerr and Allura and Keyleth left.

03:22:54.582 --> 03:22:56.077
LIAM: Allura.

03:22:56.077 --> 03:22:58.386
MATT: Okay, so you grab Allura, bring her down
below.

03:22:58.386 --> 03:23:00.103
LIAM: I hope this is all right.

03:23:00.103 --> 03:23:03.246
LAURA: I grab Percy on the broom and come down.

03:23:03.246 --> 03:23:06.262
TRAVIS: Who else is left up top?

03:23:06.262 --> 03:23:11.413
LAURA: I feel like-- wait, I pause before we go
down the stairs, 'cause I'm like, there was this

03:23:11.413 --> 03:23:14.815
blue light that happened before, and Scanlan made
it stop.

03:23:14.815 --> 03:23:16.224
TALIESIN: Oh no, we saw.

03:23:16.224 --> 03:23:20.535
LAURA: How do we not let that happen this time?

03:23:20.535 --> 03:23:23.728
TALIESIN: Did we make it down and nothing
happened?

03:23:23.728 --> 03:23:26.783
MATT: Most of you made it down. Kerrek has not
come down--

03:23:26.783 --> 03:23:30.482
MARISHA: Who hasn't made it down? Have I made it
down?

03:23:30.482 --> 03:23:32.199
MATT: Keyleth hasn't made it down yet.

03:23:32.199 --> 03:23:34.500
LAURA: I thought you already went down on the
carpet. No?

03:23:34.500 --> 03:23:38.931
MATT: Grog hasn't made it yet. So you've carried
everybody but Grog, Kerrek, and Keyleth.

03:23:38.931 --> 03:23:40.000
LAURA: Okay.

03:23:40.000 --> 03:23:45.922
LIAM: I mean, whatever the time is needed. Go up,
grab Keyleth, bring her down, go up--

03:23:45.922 --> 03:23:48.521
MARISHA: What's going on with the blue light?

03:23:48.521 --> 03:23:50.758
MATT: It doesn't seem to be having an effect right
now.

03:23:50.758 --> 03:23:52.796
LIAM: I just grabbed up Kerrek.

03:23:52.796 --> 03:23:56.805
LAURA: You can carry Kerrek?

03:23:56.805 --> 03:23:59.107
MATT: Kerrek's pretty heavy. I need you to make a
strength check.

03:23:59.107 --> 03:24:04.122
LIAM: (laughs) Best one ever. 21.

03:24:04.122 --> 03:24:09.458
LAURA: You're so strong! Oh my god! You've been
lifting, bro!

03:24:09.458 --> 03:24:16.484
MATT: It's a bit of a strain with the weight of
his armor and getting up in his years, versus your

03:24:16.484 --> 03:24:22.089
tiny half-elf frame, but you do manage to bring
him down without issue.

03:24:22.089 --> 03:24:24.360
LIAM: (strained) The Raven Queen sends her
regards.

03:24:24.360 --> 03:24:26.605
LAURA: Grog.

03:24:26.605 --> 03:24:28.619
PATRICK: I'm getting to hug all the boys in this
adventure.

03:24:28.619 --> 03:24:30.534
(laughter)

03:24:30.534 --> 03:24:32.346
PATRICK: This is Kerrek's best day ever.

03:24:32.346 --> 03:24:41.398
TALIESIN: Somebody's got a coupon for a back
massage. Welcome to Vox Machina. You seem tense.

03:24:41.398 --> 03:24:43.086
MARISHA: That's what we pay you in.

03:24:43.086 --> 03:24:48.871
LIAM: I'm sure we just killed ten minutes doing
all that shit.

03:24:48.871 --> 03:24:51.867
LAURA: Groggy, can you come down?

03:24:51.867 --> 03:24:53.897
TRAVIS: Is it just me and Keyleth?

03:24:53.897 --> 03:24:58.551
MATT: Yeah, it's just the two of you up there. No,
he brought Keyleth down. So it's just you.

03:24:58.551 --> 03:25:05.086
TRAVIS: Okay. First, I stand on the carpet. I say,
lift!

03:25:05.086 --> 03:25:09.889
MATT: The carpet takes you off the ground. You
have to kinda get your--

03:25:09.889 --> 03:25:16.738
TRAVIS: No, I lay down flat. And I grab the edges
of the carpet, and I go, okay!

03:25:16.738 --> 03:25:18.311
And try to go down.

03:25:18.311 --> 03:25:24.163
MATT: Okay. You go into a pseudo-nosedive. It's
thrilling and scary at the same moment, and as

03:25:24.163 --> 03:25:26.254
you're going up, Grog just goes past you.

03:25:26.254 --> 03:25:28.885
TRAVIS: Stop, stop, stop!

03:25:28.885 --> 03:25:33.511
MATT: And it just barely coasts past the spikes
and lets you fine on the side.

03:25:33.511 --> 03:25:39.702
TALIESIN: It's about the speed of the children's
rides at Fantasyland at Disneyland, right?

03:25:39.702 --> 03:25:45.856
MATT: Yeah, it's not super fast. Magic carpet can
go about as fast as a person, especially this

03:25:45.856 --> 03:25:49.982
size. The smaller they are, the faster they are.
This is a very big one, but not very fast.

03:25:49.982 --> 03:25:55.126
LIAM: All right. Vax does a barrel roll, heads
back down, lands, and let's start looking around

03:25:55.126 --> 03:26:01.508
again. All right, stealth, traps, still vigilant.

03:26:01.508 --> 03:26:02.845
MATT: Indeed.

03:26:02.845 --> 03:26:13.814
LIAM: For stealth, that's a 28, and investigating
for traps, ooh, that's a one, and I'm not gonna

03:26:13.814 --> 03:26:15.382
use my Luck on it.

03:26:15.382 --> 03:26:16.867
MATT: All righty.

03:26:16.867 --> 03:26:21.790
LIAM: I'm not. Seems clear. We're good. I am
badass.

03:26:21.790 --> 03:26:28.522
MATT: So, as you guys have reached the bottom of
this cylindrical chamber, you follow suit, one by

03:26:28.528 --> 03:26:31.941
one, which by the way, just so I know going
forward, what's the marching order right now?

03:26:31.941 --> 03:26:34.798
LIAM: Vax in the front.

03:26:34.798 --> 03:26:36.963
PATRICK: I'm by Grog.

03:26:36.963 --> 03:26:39.225
(laughter)

03:26:39.225 --> 03:26:40.540
TRAVIS: Yeah, baby!

03:26:40.540 --> 03:26:42.186
MATT: Grog, where are you at?

03:26:42.186 --> 03:26:43.511
TRAVIS: I'll be behind the twins.

03:26:43.511 --> 03:26:49.865
MARISHA: I'll be behind Grog. Kerr, with Grog.

03:26:49.865 --> 03:26:52.195
MATT: Percy, where are you at?

03:26:52.195 --> 03:27:00.349
TALIESIN: I think probably, maybe Scanlan and Pike
are in front of me, and then I'm probably hanging

03:27:00.349 --> 03:27:04.560
back with Kima and Allura, just sort of ready to--
I want to be at a distance.

03:27:04.560 --> 03:27:06.114
LAURA: And Trinket's--

03:27:06.114 --> 03:27:08.553
MATT: Trinket is out now?

03:27:08.553 --> 03:27:13.443
LAURA: Trinket's still in my necklace. He's
healing in the necklace.

03:27:13.443 --> 03:27:17.997
MATT: Okay. So, moving forward, following Vax's
lead--

03:27:17.997 --> 03:27:27.107
LAURA: I'm just gonna stay on the broom and just
kind of very close to the ground, but not touching

03:27:27.107 --> 03:27:28.111
the ground.

03:27:28.111 --> 03:27:38.755
MATT: Okay. So the hallway's probably 20 feet wide
and 15 feet tall, as you push forward. The walls

03:27:38.755 --> 03:27:45.005
are chiseled rather roughly, and about 30 feet
forward ahead of you, you can see it ends at a

03:27:45.005 --> 03:27:51.342
cross-section of what looks like a very deep
ravine, both above and below. There is an

03:27:51.342 --> 03:27:56.195
underground chasm here that stretches both to the
right and left, though you'd have to get to the

03:27:56.195 --> 03:28:02.643
very edge to kind of see how far it goes. It's
about 60 feet across to the other side, and you

03:28:02.643 --> 03:28:08.736
can see what looks to be another entranceway to
another hallway, and there is a taut rope bridge

03:28:08.736 --> 03:28:11.691
bolted to each side leading across.

03:28:11.691 --> 03:28:13.261
TRAVIS: We should just use that.

03:28:13.261 --> 03:28:14.686
LAURA: Totally.

03:28:14.686 --> 03:28:16.692
MARISHA: That looks safe.

03:28:16.692 --> 03:28:19.945
LIAM: Jeez, we just blew so much time on that
fucking stairwell.

03:28:19.945 --> 03:28:23.414
MARISHA: Guys, in Latin, Jehovah starts with an
'i'.

03:28:23.414 --> 03:28:27.837
LAURA: It's a leap of faith!

03:28:27.837 --> 03:28:31.314
LIAM: Should've sent you to the Marx brothers.

03:28:31.314 --> 03:28:36.452
TALIESIN: When he said 'chiseled rather roughly',
he meant Brad Pitt.

03:28:36.452 --> 03:28:40.526
LAURA: How long until your wings stop working?

03:28:40.526 --> 03:28:42.491
LIAM: I don't know. Ten or 15, I guess?

03:28:42.491 --> 03:28:43.935
LAURA: Zoinks.

03:28:44.080 --> 03:28:45.370
LIAM: Zoinks.

03:28:45.370 --> 03:28:48.463
MATT: Your wings went out before the battle and
you took a long rest, your wings are pretty much

03:28:48.463 --> 03:28:51.184
done now. 30 minutes to an hour.

03:28:51.184 --> 03:28:53.380
LIAM: Yeah, I thought we were cutting it close,
like it could be

03:28:53.380 --> 03:28:55.391
five or ten minutes at this point.

03:28:55.391 --> 03:28:59.505
MATT: Between riding everyone up and down, I'm
letting you know, right now, Mr. Already Flying

03:28:59.505 --> 03:29:01.912
Everywhere, your wings are about expended.

03:29:01.912 --> 03:29:04.012
LIAM: All right. Should I stand on the ground?

03:29:04.012 --> 03:29:07.293
MATT: That's up to you. Do you want to keep flying
until they're gone, or do you want to sit there?

03:29:07.293 --> 03:29:09.909
LIAM: I'm gonna fly to the other side of the
bridge right now.

03:29:09.909 --> 03:29:10.883
MATT: Okay.

03:29:10.883 --> 03:29:13.062
LAURA: I'm gonna go with him. On my broom.

03:29:13.062 --> 03:29:21.649
MATT: Okay. So. You get about five feet out before
the wings go (fsh).

03:29:21.649 --> 03:29:23.875
LIAM: Over nothing?

03:29:23.875 --> 03:29:28.791
MATT: Looking down, you see darkness, and there's
a few stalagtites that--

03:29:28.791 --> 03:29:35.937
LIAM: I throw a dagger at the other side of the
chasm, 60 feet, sharpshooter, into the side near

03:29:35.937 --> 03:29:37.697
the top. Whisper.

03:29:37.697 --> 03:29:40.209
LAURA: This is why I went on the broom, I was
gonna catch you.

03:29:40.209 --> 03:29:44.741
LIAM: As an attack?

03:29:44.741 --> 03:29:48.885
MATT: You're attacking just the wall above, or--

03:29:48.885 --> 03:29:55.798
LIAM: There's a cliff facing me, right? Yeah, just
into the rock wall of the cliff. 20.

03:29:55.798 --> 03:30:04.297
MATT: 20, okay. The dagger hits the edge, and you
appear right at the edge of the cliff. You're

03:30:04.297 --> 03:30:07.004
gonna try to reach and grab. Make a dexterity
saving throw.

03:30:07.004 --> 03:30:09.850
LIAM: 22.

03:30:09.850 --> 03:30:12.520
MATT: Okay, so you grab and get up on the
other side.

03:30:12.520 --> 03:30:17.129
LAURA: Jesus! Small heart attack over here.

03:30:17.129 --> 03:30:25.161
MATT: You didn't even really fall for a moment.
Vex, you're floating across, and it feels strange,

03:30:25.161 --> 03:30:34.797
going across. There's no wind, but the broom is
acting extremely wobbly, and the way you control

03:30:34.797 --> 03:30:43.551
it and maneuver around, you feel almost drunk, but
you're not. This is not acting properly.

03:30:43.551 --> 03:30:45.392
LAURA: I'm gonna turn around and go back to the--

03:30:45.392 --> 03:30:47.160
MATT: Okay, so you head back?

03:30:47.160 --> 03:30:51.355
LAURA: That was weird. It doesn't feel right.

03:30:51.355 --> 03:30:56.175
TALIESIN: Okay, I'm going to grab on to the
bridge, I'm going to test it, I'm going to step to

03:30:56.175 --> 03:30:57.906
see if it's real. I'm checking it.

03:30:57.906 --> 03:31:07.344
MATT: Okay. You take your hands there, holding,
and you put your foot out onto the wood, and it's

03:31:07.344 --> 03:31:08.960
sturdy. It's strong.

03:31:08.960 --> 03:31:11.437
TRAVIS: (laughs) You bastard.

03:31:11.437 --> 03:31:19.954
MARISHA: I go up to the edge of the rope bridge
that Percy's now standing on. I lean down and on

03:31:19.954 --> 03:31:28.277
the dirt I cast Druidcraft. Can I craft some vines
to help reinforce the bridge?

03:31:28.277 --> 03:31:35.366
MATT: With Druidcraft, you can create some small
vines that wrap around it, and it might help in

03:31:35.366 --> 03:31:38.379
some regard, but not a lot. Druidcraft is a very
limited cantrip.

03:31:38.379 --> 03:31:45.614
TALIESIN: I'm gonna grab one end of the infinite
rope, and I'm gonna hand the other end of the

03:31:45.614 --> 03:31:52.749
infinite rope to someone who's staying. I think
that I pose a good chance of getting across this

03:31:52.749 --> 03:31:57.524
safely. I'm going to make a run for it. Well, not
a run.

03:31:57.524 --> 03:31:59.244
TRAVIS: Are you literally going to run?

03:31:59.244 --> 03:32:01.066
TALIESIN: No, I'm going to walk. Gingerly.

03:32:01.066 --> 03:32:02.798
TRAVIS: Oh. So you're gonna make a walk for it.

03:32:02.798 --> 03:32:08.435
TALIESIN: I'm tying the rope-- That may be one of
the smartest things you've ever said. I don't

03:32:08.435 --> 03:32:10.646
actually have a retort for it on any level.

03:32:10.646 --> 03:32:14.803
TRAVIS: I don't know why-- what is 'retort'?
Okay.

03:32:14.803 --> 03:32:21.709
TALIESIN: It means if I die, you win. I'm going to
tie the infinite rope to myself and hand it off to

03:32:21.709 --> 03:32:28.912
Grog. Oh god. I'm handing it to Grog. And I'm
going to start gingerly stepping out onto the

03:32:28.912 --> 03:32:34.120
bridge, being very careful, and checking with each
step that's it's real, and looking for weird

03:32:34.120 --> 03:32:37.280
glyphs or signs or anything out of the ordinary.

03:32:37.280 --> 03:32:41.301
LAURA: Percy? Be careful.

03:32:41.301 --> 03:32:42.769
MATT: Make a dexterity check.

03:32:42.769 --> 03:32:47.518
MARISHA: As this happens, Scanlan sings, hey
Percy, you're so fine, you're so fine you blow my

03:32:47.518 --> 03:32:53.356
mind, hey Percy! Hey Percy! Hey Percy, you're so
fine, you're so fine you blow my mind, with your

03:32:53.356 --> 03:32:58.495
gun! With your gun! And then he gets a point of
inspiration.

03:32:58.495 --> 03:33:01.861
MATT: All right, so you get your d12 inspiration
die.

03:33:01.861 --> 03:33:03.544
TRAVIS: Marisha, that was really nice.

03:33:03.544 --> 03:33:07.497
MARISHA: Thank you. I feel like I had the same
witty repartee as Sam Riegel.

03:33:07.497 --> 03:33:13.738
LIAM: Okay, okay, now just smile and make the
smile as big as Manhattan.

03:33:13.738 --> 03:33:15.374
MATT: Dexterity saving throw.

03:33:15.374 --> 03:33:25.527
TALIESIN: That's not bad. That's 22.

03:33:25.527 --> 03:33:32.229
MATT: That's really good. All right, so as you
start stepping out, you feel this shift in the

03:33:32.229 --> 03:33:34.206
space, and you grab on to the edges of the--

03:33:34.206 --> 03:33:39.295
TALIESIN: I'm also using my boots, and I'm gluing
them to whatever the-- yeah.

03:33:39.295 --> 03:33:44.167
MATT: Right. And as you glue the boots there,
that's really what solidifies you in place, and

03:33:44.167 --> 03:33:46.024
you're still there, on the bridge, without a
problem.

03:33:46.024 --> 03:33:48.767
TALIESIN: Are things just getting weird out here?

03:33:48.767 --> 03:33:53.797
MATT: It feels weird. You can't quite understand
what's transpiring, but it just feels weird.

03:33:53.797 --> 03:33:59.657
LAURA: Allura. It felt like almost I was drunk as
I was flying across that. Do you know--

03:33:59.657 --> 03:34:03.377
MATT: "I don't think it's drunk, per se, it's just
that you're not used to flying in that direction."

03:34:03.377 --> 03:34:07.630
And she points out towards the ravine, and you
watch as Percy, who's kind of holding onto the

03:34:07.630 --> 03:34:11.776
ravine, feet solid, his hair is just up.

03:34:11.776 --> 03:34:14.117
LIAM: Gravity is fucked.

03:34:14.117 --> 03:34:20.062
TALIESIN: Well, this will be fine. Is gravity
flipped?

03:34:20.062 --> 03:34:22.837
MATT: As you hear this conversation, it seems that
way, yeah.

03:34:22.837 --> 03:34:29.447
TALIESIN: I'm going to spider-climb. I'm just
going to use my spider-climb boots, and I'm going

03:34:29.447 --> 03:34:31.506
to make my way, with the rope.

03:34:31.506 --> 03:34:39.197
MATT: You do so. Make it across the way. The wood
shivers a little bit, shifts beneath your feet,

03:34:39.197 --> 03:34:42.469
being pulled upward from your weight. You guys
watch as the bridge that was once taut is now

03:34:42.469 --> 03:34:46.715
arcing up and following Percy as he moves across,
his weight pulling it upward.

03:34:46.715 --> 03:34:48.770
MARISHA: That's cool.

03:34:48.770 --> 03:34:53.988
LAURA: So can I try flying out there, knowing the
gravity's shifted? Does it feel okay to fly out

03:34:53.988 --> 03:34:54.990
like that?

03:34:55.147 --> 03:35:00.378
MATT: As you fly out and spin yourself
underneath-- yes, you do actually manage to fly,

03:35:00.378 --> 03:35:05.720
essentially barrel roll across, and manage to make
it across to your brother without an issue.

03:35:05.720 --> 03:35:08.510
LAURA: Oh, I didn't want to go all the way across,
I just wanted to test it so I could help bring

03:35:08.510 --> 03:35:09.894
other people across.

03:35:09.894 --> 03:35:15.181
TALIESIN: We've got now a third rope, we can
literally just clip people to the rope, now.

03:35:15.181 --> 03:35:20.373
LIAM: It was like pole-dancing, but in space?
Upside-down?

03:35:20.373 --> 03:35:27.594
TALIESIN: We can use the rope we just made as a
clipped rappel rope, can we? That's a thing that

03:35:27.594 --> 03:35:28.833
we can do.

03:35:28.833 --> 03:35:31.514
LAURA: Potentially?

03:35:31.514 --> 03:35:37.608
TALIESIN: If everybody wants to try and cross, we
can actually-- we now have an unencumbered piece

03:35:37.608 --> 03:35:40.295
that we can use to get people across.

03:35:40.295 --> 03:35:43.877
TRAVIS: I'm gonna jump.

03:35:43.877 --> 03:35:52.225
LIAM: No, no, that's a bad idea, Grog. You are
very hefty and the gravity turns upside-down.

03:35:52.225 --> 03:35:53.892
TALIESIN: There's probably spikes up there.

03:35:53.892 --> 03:35:56.059
LAURA: Grog, did you see how I barrel-rolled on my
broom?

03:35:56.059 --> 03:35:57.489
TRAVIS: Yeah, do I twist in the air?

03:35:57.489 --> 03:35:59.694
LAURA: Yeah, you should just do the same thing on
the carpet.

03:35:59.694 --> 03:36:05.859
LIAM: Wait, what if he took the carpet and hung
off the bottom of it on the first side and then as

03:36:05.859 --> 03:36:08.525
he made his way over, he'd be all right. You know
what I mean?

03:36:08.525 --> 03:36:09.777
LAURA: I don't know.

03:36:09.777 --> 03:36:15.413
MATT: Vex, Vax, and Keyleth, as you guys are
having this conversation, something catches the

03:36:15.413 --> 03:36:20.329
corner of your eye, and you watch something just
go (tss), just whizz past from the bottom of the

03:36:20.329 --> 03:36:21.648
ravine to the top.

03:36:21.648 --> 03:36:23.440
LIAM: We saw that. We saw that.

03:36:23.440 --> 03:36:24.970
MATT: You saw something quickly just go by.

03:36:24.970 --> 03:36:27.501
LAURA: Can I get a better look, can I look and see
if I see it again?

03:36:27.501 --> 03:36:30.445
MATT: Yeah, the three of you guys make a
perception check as you kind of come up to the

03:36:30.445 --> 03:36:31.790
edge and look.

03:36:31.790 --> 03:36:33.609
LIAM: 26.

03:36:33.609 --> 03:36:35.250
MARISHA: 14.

03:36:35.250 --> 03:36:36.773
LAURA: Is this related to dragons?

03:36:36.773 --> 03:36:38.827
MATT: This is not related to dragons.

03:36:38.827 --> 03:36:45.574
LAURA: Then that is a 21.

03:36:45.574 --> 03:36:46.900
LIAM: 26.

03:36:46.900 --> 03:36:56.924
MATT: All right. So you're seeing little things,
just right out of the middle of the light, you can

03:36:56.924 --> 03:37:03.494
see something shifting above and below you. You
guys have a little better view. You still can't

03:37:03.494 --> 03:37:09.827
quite see-- the length of your Darkvision is too
far for you to see what is below you or

03:37:09.827 --> 03:37:11.202
necessarily what's above--

03:37:11.202 --> 03:37:13.868
MARISHA: Can I, as a quick reaction, grab the rope
bridge?

03:37:13.868 --> 03:37:20.358
MATT: Yeah. So you're still off to the side, just
holding onto the bridge? Okay. You are beginning

03:37:20.358 --> 03:37:30.062
to watch what looks to be figures. Humanoid
bodies.

03:37:30.062 --> 03:37:31.927
TALIESIN: Oh, I have a theory.

03:37:31.927 --> 03:37:37.651
MATT: Just tumbling past. One of them hits the
edge of the bridge and it keeps spinning off as it

03:37:37.651 --> 03:37:39.189
disappears into the darkness above.

03:37:39.189 --> 03:37:42.612
TALIESIN: I have a weird theory. I'm going to
grab-- what do I have that I can do this with?

03:37:42.612 --> 03:37:46.175
LIAM: But they look like spirits falling upwards?

03:37:46.175 --> 03:37:55.954
MATT: You watch a couple more go by, and they are
nearly skeletal bodies falling upward. But, as you

03:37:55.954 --> 03:38:03.407
watch a couple more go by, they're limp, somewhat,
but still moving as they scoot past.

03:38:03.407 --> 03:38:07.346
LAURA: Let's just get across here, shall we?

03:38:07.346 --> 03:38:10.543
LIAM: I'm going to use Divine Sense, now. Just to
confirm.

03:38:10.543 --> 03:38:15.837
MATT: You wait about a minute or so before one
comes close enough to hit the sense, but there is

03:38:15.837 --> 03:38:22.735
an undead energy that passes past, and both you
and Kerr have this moment from across the ravine

03:38:22.735 --> 03:38:25.181
from each other, seeing this.

03:38:25.181 --> 03:38:28.499
PATRICK: Gonna throw up the horns.

03:38:28.499 --> 03:38:31.991
LIAM: That's me to you, man.

03:38:31.991 --> 03:38:36.367
TALIESIN: Try and clock them, see if it's the same
bodies over and over again. If it's an infinite

03:38:36.367 --> 03:38:37.679
loop of falling.

03:38:37.679 --> 03:38:39.642
MARISHA: An infinite loop of falling?

03:38:39.642 --> 03:38:43.393
LAURA: Okay, so I wanna get a good look at one of
them as they go by.

03:38:43.393 --> 03:38:44.888
LIAM: Oh, it's a gif.

03:38:44.888 --> 03:38:45.973
MARISHA: Six seconds.

03:38:45.973 --> 03:38:55.007
MATT: Three or four more stumble past, and they're
getting more and more rapid. And they're different

03:38:55.007 --> 03:38:59.156
sizes, they do not appear to be the same bodies.

03:38:59.156 --> 03:39:03.304
LAURA: I pick up Pike and try to barrel roll
across.

03:39:03.304 --> 03:39:09.732
MATT: Okay. Barrel roll across. As you're making
it across, three more come tumbling up, two of

03:39:09.732 --> 03:39:14.868
them too far away, but one of them does reach out
with its arms as it tumbles past you, and swats

03:39:14.868 --> 03:39:19.944
out to try and grab you. I need you to make an
acrobatics check.

03:39:19.944 --> 03:39:28.402
LIAM: You got this. Oh, you got such a bonus. Come
on, girl!

03:39:28.402 --> 03:39:34.884
TRAVIS: Such a bonus, huh? Such a bonus. Look at
Matt's face. Look at his face.

03:39:34.884 --> 03:39:37.257
TALIESIN: Oh, fuck no.

03:39:37.257 --> 03:39:41.148
MARISHA: Oh, come on. No, come on.

03:39:41.148 --> 03:39:43.527
LIAM: Do they both make that roll?

03:39:43.527 --> 03:39:46.738
MATT: She's the one driving the broom. She's
having to try and maneuver.

03:39:46.738 --> 03:39:51.453
TALIESIN: I was about to interject, and I know
that I didn't make that fast enough, but at some

03:39:51.453 --> 03:39:54.009
point I would already like to be moving to
interject in this.

03:39:54.009 --> 03:39:58.929
MATT: Right, as you're watching them start going
across, you get a step out onto the bridge--

03:39:58.929 --> 03:40:01.156
TALIESIN: I'm not going onto the bridge, I'm
pulling out my gun--

03:40:01.156 --> 03:40:07.382
LAURA: Oh wait, Pike has a thing that she can help
people with their--

03:40:07.382 --> 03:40:10.698
TRAVIS: War God's Blessing?

03:40:10.698 --> 03:40:12.356
MATT: That's an attack roll.

03:40:12.356 --> 03:40:13.538
LAURA: Damn it!

03:40:13.538 --> 03:40:16.236
MATT: War gods don't help you survive, they help
you kill shit.

03:40:16.236 --> 03:40:17.531
TRAVIS: Do what you're gonna do, Mercer.

03:40:17.531 --> 03:40:19.926
TALIESIN: I was gonna start skeet-shooting at some
point, so.

03:40:19.926 --> 03:40:29.419
MATT: Understood, but before we get to that. So
the creature grabs you and essentially grapples

03:40:29.419 --> 03:40:36.297
you in the moment. As that happens, the momentum
of pulling you up causes the broom to shift out of

03:40:36.297 --> 03:40:41.691
whack, and you begin to careen in a slight circle.
I need you and Pike

03:40:41.691 --> 03:40:44.339
to both make strength saving throws.

03:40:44.339 --> 03:40:47.975
PATRICK: How far away is this?

03:40:47.975 --> 03:40:50.552
MATT: They're about 30 feet from you.

03:40:50.552 --> 03:40:52.208
MARISHA: What about from Keyleth?

03:40:52.208 --> 03:40:55.750
MATT: About the same, so you guys are on the other
side of the ravine.

03:40:55.750 --> 03:41:06.190
LAURA: She's got a plus four on strength. Nine for
me.

03:41:06.190 --> 03:41:08.544
LIAM: 13 for Pike.

03:41:08.544 --> 03:41:25.702
MATT: So. Okay. So Pike's on the broom with you.
You get grabbed and yanked off the broom. Pike

03:41:25.702 --> 03:41:30.930
manages to hold the broom, but currently Pike is
not the current driver of it, and so she's

03:41:30.930 --> 03:41:37.945
clutching a broom that's just floating in the
gravity. You watch as both Pike and Vex go from

03:41:37.945 --> 03:41:41.589
careening off to tumbling upward into the darkness
above.

03:41:41.589 --> 03:41:43.181
MARISHA: Are they both attached to the broom?

03:41:43.181 --> 03:41:44.546
MATT: No. Vex is pulled off the broom.

03:41:44.546 --> 03:41:45.896
TALIESIN: But she's still tethered.

03:41:45.896 --> 03:41:47.880
MATT: She's still tethered, yeah.

03:41:47.880 --> 03:41:51.142
MARISHA: Does Keyleth have an action?

03:41:51.142 --> 03:41:55.540
MATT: Right now, the two of you can both make an
action.

03:41:55.540 --> 03:42:00.611
TALIESIN: All right, my first action, I was just
pulling to try and skeet-shoot and sharpshoot with

03:42:00.611 --> 03:42:08.884
Bad News to hit the undead that had grappled her,
and I assume I have spend a grit to get him to let

03:42:08.884 --> 03:42:10.475
go. To shove him off.

03:42:10.475 --> 03:42:16.605
MATT: Because of the nature of the rapid movement,
you are at a disadvantage on this attack.

03:42:16.605 --> 03:42:19.164
MARISHA: You still have the inspiration, right?

03:42:19.164 --> 03:42:20.975
TALIESIN: I still have that d12 inspiration.

03:42:20.975 --> 03:42:28.462
LIAM: Matt? Watching this, I'm going to pull
Whisper out and watch to see my sister falling

03:42:28.462 --> 03:42:31.359
through the air, and if I see her falling, I'm
going to throw the dagger at her.

03:42:31.359 --> 03:42:33.769
MATT: Okay. She's falling.

03:42:33.769 --> 03:42:35.529
LIAM: Down or up?

03:42:35.529 --> 03:42:36.770
MATT: Up.

03:42:36.770 --> 03:42:41.335
LIAM: I'm watching him and I'm watching her, and
if she goes-- how far away is she from me?

03:42:41.335 --> 03:42:48.053
MATT: Right now, she's about 30 feet out from the
ravine, and now tumbling upward, she's about 50

03:42:48.053 --> 03:42:49.332
feet from you.

03:42:49.332 --> 03:42:52.271
MARISHA: 'Cause he's on the other side, correct?

03:42:52.271 --> 03:42:54.941
TALIESIN: Oh, for fuck's sake, really?

03:42:54.941 --> 03:42:57.102
MATT: Misfire?

03:42:57.102 --> 03:42:58.733
TALIESIN: Misfire.

03:42:58.733 --> 03:43:03.360
MARISHA: All righty. Keyleth's gonna go. Seeing
Percy misfire, Keyleth is going to grab a Grasping

03:43:03.360 --> 03:43:10.514
Vine on the side of the wall, and she's going to
go for that broom. 'Cause both Pike and her are

03:43:10.514 --> 03:43:12.352
still grabbing onto that broom, yeah?

03:43:12.352 --> 03:43:14.912
LIAM: And I'm throwing Whisper at Vex. I'm doing
it.

03:43:14.912 --> 03:43:18.336
MATT: The vine, unfortunately, only has a range of
30 feet.

03:43:18.336 --> 03:43:20.568
MARISHA: You said she was 30 feet away.

03:43:20.568 --> 03:43:25.999
MATT: She's 30 feet out from the center of the
ravine and is now 15, 20 feet up in the air.

03:43:25.999 --> 03:43:29.926
MARISHA: Can she not hit the wall, get a vine off
the side of the wall and bring her down?

03:43:29.926 --> 03:43:31.662
MATT: The opposite side? Maybe.

03:43:31.662 --> 03:43:37.748
MARISHA: I've got a 60-foot range to this spell,
plus 30 feet from the Grasping Vine, right? Or is

03:43:37.748 --> 03:43:42.093
it 30 and 30? I thought you were still grabbing
onto the--

03:43:42.093 --> 03:43:43.792
LAURA: I'm tethered to the broom.

03:43:43.792 --> 03:43:50.457
MARISHA: To the broom, and Pike's still grabbing
onto the broom, yeah? I'm going for the broom.

03:43:50.457 --> 03:43:54.537
Come on, man!

03:43:54.537 --> 03:43:57.692
(laughter)

03:43:57.692 --> 03:44:04.250
MATT: Look, I'm trying to work out-- you guys do a
lot of things really fast. I'm trying, I'm working

03:44:04.250 --> 03:44:07.750
with you, so please bear with me on this.

03:44:07.750 --> 03:44:11.540
MARISHA: Grasping Vine! What? What?

03:44:11.540 --> 03:44:13.192
LIAM: You're like a loan officer.

03:44:13.192 --> 03:44:15.364
MATT: I wouldn't recommend doing that or I won't
give you a chance to even do it.

03:44:15.364 --> 03:44:16.854
Don't taunt the DM.

03:44:16.854 --> 03:44:20.396
LIAM: I want to sell you this house, but there's
some shit we need to go over.

03:44:20.396 --> 03:44:29.256
MATT: So. I'm going to ask you, Keyleth, to go
ahead and make just a general dexterity check.

03:44:29.256 --> 03:44:34.437
MARISHA: Just general dex? What?

03:44:34.437 --> 03:44:40.038
MATT: This is how fast you're able to enchant a
spell, which requires an incantation and the

03:44:40.038 --> 03:44:44.833
release of the spell's effect, thus summoning the
vine and causing it to lash out. This is just a

03:44:44.833 --> 03:44:49.365
general, base DC, I need you to go ahead and just
roll and add your dexterity modifier.

03:44:49.365 --> 03:44:51.264
LAURA: You got it, you got it.

03:44:51.264 --> 03:44:52.501
MARISHA: I love you.

03:44:52.501 --> 03:44:53.652
LAURA: I love you.

03:44:53.652 --> 03:45:01.470
MARISHA: That was a natural 19, so that is plus my
dex, which is plus two, so 21. Hah!

03:45:01.470 --> 03:45:04.597
LAURA: Don't hah, don't hah the DM!

03:45:04.597 --> 03:45:09.583
MARISHA: I mean, (yells, grunts).

03:45:09.583 --> 03:45:17.733
MATT: So, as Bad News misfires, you watch as the
front of it just, this burst of black smoke bursts

03:45:17.733 --> 03:45:23.693
outward, and this look of utter horror on Percy's
face. Keyleth rushes out, and grabbing the edge of

03:45:23.693 --> 03:45:28.722
the rope bridge to get enough of a reach out
there, you watch as her hair lifts up and part of

03:45:28.722 --> 03:45:33.641
her body begins to just drift upward, but she
holds on and reaches out with the staff, and,

03:45:33.641 --> 03:45:39.530
using the strength of her force of will, the edge
of the stone above the ravine cracks open and

03:45:39.530 --> 03:45:45.780
suddenly you watch where there is no life, a
piercing flash of dark green shoots outward, a

03:45:45.780 --> 03:45:50.889
vine freshly grown from the edge of the stonework
reaches out and grabs, wrapping around the broom

03:45:50.889 --> 03:45:56.715
itself and holding it taut. You watch as the vine
and the entire group shifts upward. You're

03:45:56.715 --> 03:46:02.861
suddenly pulled, you're still grappled by this
undead zombie-like corpse, and Pike is currently

03:46:02.861 --> 03:46:09.912
clutching onto the broom as hard as she can as you
both impact at the end. With your weight and the

03:46:09.912 --> 03:46:11.887
creature's weight, I now get to see if the--

03:46:11.887 --> 03:46:13.370
LAURA: Vine holds?

03:46:13.370 --> 03:46:17.960
MATT: Well, not the vine. The vine magically
holds. It's the chain that attaches you to the

03:46:17.960 --> 03:46:25.687
broom. Yeah, okay. So that holds. It goes taut,
you're held there. The creature's still clutching

03:46:25.687 --> 03:46:26.858
you right now.

03:46:26.858 --> 03:46:28.368
LAURA: Are my arms restrained?

03:46:28.368 --> 03:46:34.505
MATT: Your arms are held to, yeah. Actually,
'cause you're still held there, I want you to go

03:46:34.505 --> 03:46:36.696
ahead and make another acrobatics check.

03:46:36.696 --> 03:46:39.329
LIAM: Holy fuck.

03:46:39.329 --> 03:46:49.161
LAURA: Acrobatics. That's Pike. Acrobatics. 25.

03:46:49.161 --> 03:46:56.369
MATT: 25. So it does not progress into restrained.
You're still grappled, it's still holding on to

03:46:56.369 --> 03:47:02.105
you, but you manage to swivel out of its grasp, as
it's trying to pull you in, and it's starting to

03:47:02.105 --> 03:47:08.998
try and bite into you. As you glance upward, now
that you're drifting, dangling roughly 60 feet up,

03:47:08.998 --> 03:47:15.056
you look up, and you can see what is the top of
the ravine, and it is a writhing mass of hundreds

03:47:15.056 --> 03:47:21.388
and hundreds of undead corpses that are all
reaching out for you, their different-boned claws

03:47:21.388 --> 03:47:29.556
all extended, going (rasping), trying to just pull
you towards them into empty air, as you dangle,

03:47:29.556 --> 03:47:31.007
looking up into that.

03:47:31.007 --> 03:47:32.314
LIAM: This is fine.

03:47:32.314 --> 03:47:33.607
LAURA: Oh. My. God.

03:47:33.607 --> 03:47:34.875
MARISHA: Everything's okay.

03:47:34.875 --> 03:47:36.451
LAURA: Everything's fine, you guys.

03:47:36.451 --> 03:47:46.136
MATT: At which point, the vine pulls the broom,
Pike, you, and the creature up towards the edge of

03:47:46.136 --> 03:47:51.344
the wall. So you're still 30 feet up, but you're
slammed into the side of the wall, now, the vine

03:47:51.344 --> 03:47:53.985
is just holding the broom taut against the edge of
the rocks.

03:47:53.985 --> 03:47:55.074
MARISHA: Sorry!

03:47:55.074 --> 03:48:01.274
LAURA: No, I love you! You're amazing! Can I just
take out-- I just have a dagger, can I pull out my

03:48:01.274 --> 03:48:04.987
dagger and try to jam it up into the zombie's--
under his chin?

03:48:04.987 --> 03:48:09.643
MATT: Go for it. It's going to attempt to bite
attack you, by the way. Which it does not do with

03:48:09.643 --> 03:48:13.470
a two. Just getting your armor, gnawing on the
leather.

03:48:13.470 --> 03:48:20.818
LAURA: Oh, it's all zombie drool! I am really bad
at regular attacks. What do I add to this?

03:48:20.818 --> 03:48:27.979
MATT: You add your dexterity and your proficiency
modifier. So it would be plus ten, I think.

03:48:27.979 --> 03:48:28.885
LAURA: So 20.

03:48:28.885 --> 03:48:32.282
MATT: Okay, yeah, so you jam it with the dagger.
Go ahead and roll damage. That's 1d4 plus your

03:48:32.282 --> 03:48:33.763
dexterity modifier.

03:48:33.763 --> 03:48:39.797
LAURA: Oh, plus my dexterity. I didn't roll a 20,
I rolled--

03:48:39.797 --> 03:48:43.498
MATT: It's a d4 plus five, is what you're rolling
for damage.

03:48:43.498 --> 03:48:45.509
LAURA: Eight.

03:48:45.509 --> 03:48:53.240
MATT: Okay, so eight damage. You jam the dagger up
into its jaw and throat, and it slaps it out of

03:48:53.240 --> 03:49:00.870
the way. You can see it's damaged, but it's still
holding on. The creature's now grabbing onto you

03:49:00.870 --> 03:49:02.899
and slamming you into the wall best it can.

03:49:02.899 --> 03:49:04.337
LAURA: What is Pike doing?

03:49:04.337 --> 03:49:12.546
MATT: Pike is just holding onto the broom right
now. She's going to attempt to-- actually, what

03:49:12.546 --> 03:49:17.797
she would do in this moment would be Turn Undead.
'Cause that's what clerics do.

03:49:17.797 --> 03:49:22.026
LAURA: I didn't even see that spell, where's that
spell?

03:49:22.026 --> 03:49:24.015
MATT: It's not a spell, it's her Channel Divinity
ability.

03:49:24.015 --> 03:49:30.392
PATRICK: Yeah, it's Channel Divinity, but I
couldn't do it from the edge of the pit.

03:49:30.392 --> 03:49:31.680
It's 30 feet.

03:49:31.680 --> 03:49:37.602
MATT: Yeah, you have to be closer from there.
Okay, so it has to make a saving throw, which it

03:49:37.602 --> 03:49:43.261
does not make. So as you look over and this
zombie's biting at you and you're trying to jam at

03:49:43.261 --> 03:49:47.927
it, Pike, who's holding onto the broom, grabs the
symbol of Sarenrae from around her neck and looks

03:49:47.927 --> 03:49:52.438
up and just closes her eyes for a second, and as
they flash open again, there's no pupils, just

03:49:52.438 --> 03:49:59.463
white, bright, vibrant, radiant eyes. This small
shockwave bursts off her, and you watch as the

03:49:59.463 --> 03:50:03.680
zombie goes (gasps) just turns into ash and
disintegrates, its body just tumbling in chunks

03:50:03.680 --> 03:50:05.701
and pieces up into the ravine above you.

03:50:05.701 --> 03:50:08.534
LAURA: So I would look down at Pike.

03:50:08.534 --> 03:50:13.662
MATT: Yes, and then up at where the zombie went.
Pike is below you, still holding onto the broom.

03:50:13.662 --> 03:50:20.437
LAURA: You're amazing! That was amazing! This was
a mistake. How do we get down?

03:50:20.437 --> 03:50:22.557
MATT: "I don't know. Keyleth?"

03:50:22.557 --> 03:50:25.501
MARISHA: I'm holding on, man.

03:50:25.501 --> 03:50:29.931
LIAM: Where's the carpet, where's the carpet,
where's the carpet?

03:50:29.931 --> 03:50:31.417
TALIESIN: The carpet is not what we need.

03:50:31.417 --> 03:50:35.818
MATT: A few more corpses start tumbling up.

03:50:35.818 --> 03:50:41.577
TALIESIN: The rope that is currently tied at the
other end of the ravine, where they're currently

03:50:41.577 --> 03:50:44.460
above us, right?

03:50:44.460 --> 03:50:48.082
MATT: Yes, they're about 30 feet above you guys on
the opposite side.

03:50:48.082 --> 03:50:51.621
TALIESIN: I'm going to try and reverse rappel with
the rope, the other end of the endless rope,

03:50:51.621 --> 03:50:52.522
up to them.

03:50:52.522 --> 03:50:59.418
MARISHA: Also, as a bonus action, I can switch the
direction of the vine to lash out at the same

03:50:59.418 --> 03:51:08.940
creature as a bonus action, so can I grasp a vine
and hand them off and stair-step them down?

03:51:08.940 --> 03:51:16.304
MATT: No, the vine is attached at a base, it's
almost like it grew out of the ground, so what

03:51:16.304 --> 03:51:21.247
Grasping Vine allows you to do, is you can--
wherever it's based at, it pulls it to it.

03:51:21.247 --> 03:51:27.127
MARISHA: Right. It just says, until the spell
ends, you can direct the vine to lash out at the

03:51:27.127 --> 03:51:30.115
same creature on my bonus action. So.

03:51:30.115 --> 03:51:34.763
MATT: It doesn't do damage. What it does is it
just grasps and pulls towards it. So what you can

03:51:34.763 --> 03:51:38.426
do is, each turn you can change the target. If you
change the target, it's gonna release the broom

03:51:38.426 --> 03:51:39.865
and they're both gonna tumble up.

03:51:39.865 --> 03:51:42.747
MARISHA: Well, I don't wanna do that. But I can't
change the origin of the vine?

03:51:42.747 --> 03:51:44.278
MATT: Not without casting the spell again.

03:51:44.278 --> 03:51:47.324
TALIESIN: I'm gonna reverse-Batman this shit.

03:51:47.324 --> 03:51:49.853
MATT: All right, so you start reverse-rappelling
up the side. What's everyone else doing?

03:51:49.853 --> 03:51:51.936
LIAM: Where's Grog and the flying carpet?

03:51:51.936 --> 03:51:57.341
MATT: Grog, Kerrek, and Keyleth are all still on
the other side with Kima and Allura. They're all

03:51:57.341 --> 03:51:58.641
on the other side of the ravine.

03:51:58.641 --> 03:52:00.583
LIAM: Get off the rug, get off the rug. Get off
the rug, now, please.

03:52:00.583 --> 03:52:02.021
MARISHA: I'm not on the rug!

03:52:02.021 --> 03:52:06.069
LIAM: Isn't anyone on the rug? That's why I
asked.

03:52:06.069 --> 03:52:08.291
MATT: The rug is still with them, it's on the
other side.

03:52:08.291 --> 03:52:10.583
LIAM: Back where it was. Shit.

03:52:10.583 --> 03:52:12.029
MATT: Nobody's taken the rug across--

03:52:12.029 --> 03:52:14.605
TALIESIN: The rug's a terrible idea, right now,
anyway.

03:52:14.605 --> 03:52:18.044
TRAVIS: I can't get on the rug, so one of you
lighter people, will you go get those two,

03:52:18.044 --> 03:52:19.235
please?

03:52:19.235 --> 03:52:22.914
TALIESIN: I'm just, I'm going up super fucking
fast.

03:52:22.914 --> 03:52:26.838
MATT: Okay, so you rappel up the side. While
they're holding on there, one more corpse tumbles

03:52:26.838 --> 03:52:29.311
up past. It's going to attempt to--

03:52:29.311 --> 03:52:40.803
LAURA: Can I-- no, I can't do that. I'm like
floating, basically. Basically I'm like falling

03:52:40.803 --> 03:52:44.739
and just held onto a broom that's being held onto
the wall.

03:52:44.739 --> 03:52:51.336
MATT: Right now, if you were to try and take a
shot, you could try, but you'd be at disadvantage

03:52:51.336 --> 03:52:52.518
for all your attacks.

03:52:52.518 --> 03:52:56.276
LAURA: I want to try to-- any zombies or undead
that come near us, I want to try to shoot them

03:52:56.276 --> 03:52:57.781
and at least ricochet.

03:52:57.781 --> 03:53:01.047
MATT: Okay, well, one comes tumbling past.
What are you doing, Kerr?

03:53:01.047 --> 03:53:05.683
PATRICK: If nobody else on this side is getting on
this carpet, then I will.

03:53:05.683 --> 03:53:08.573
MATT: Okay, so Kerrek hops on the carpet and it
begins to lift above the ground.

03:53:08.573 --> 03:53:11.514
MARISHA: Can I get on it as well and still
maintain the concentration on my Grasping Vine?

03:53:11.514 --> 03:53:14.195
TRAVIS: But why would you do that, because you've
gotta put two people on that carpet?

03:53:14.195 --> 03:53:15.939
MARISHA: What?

03:53:15.939 --> 03:53:17.816
TRAVIS: We're trying to put them on the carpet,
right?

03:53:17.816 --> 03:53:24.048
TALIESIN: It can hold four or five people.

03:53:24.048 --> 03:53:30.748
MARISHA: I'm trying to hold the concentration on
their Grasping Vine so they don't get fucked. So

03:53:30.748 --> 03:53:33.921
I'm going to get on the carpet.

03:53:33.921 --> 03:53:37.432
TRAVIS: You know, if you get hit by something that
falls.

03:53:37.432 --> 03:53:42.394
MARISHA: That's true. But I have advantage on
concentration checks these days.

03:53:42.394 --> 03:53:44.060
MATT: Allura--

03:53:44.060 --> 03:53:47.337
LAURA: Oh my god.

03:53:47.337 --> 03:53:48.881
TALIESIN: Hang on, I'm coming.

03:53:48.881 --> 03:53:54.505
LAURA: Yeah, no, that's the thing. Percy's on his
way to save us, so you guys just try to hold onto

03:53:54.505 --> 03:53:55.684
that carpet.

03:53:55.684 --> 03:53:57.409
TALIESIN: Get across, we need people to pull us
back.

03:53:57.409 --> 03:54:02.731
MARISHA: Also, Grasping Vine's not a concentration
spell. It's a bonus action, and-- no, no, it's a

03:54:02.731 --> 03:54:03.867
concentration spell.

03:54:03.867 --> 03:54:13.351
MATT: Allura, watching this happen, grabs Kima and
Dimension Doors across to the other side, sets

03:54:13.351 --> 03:54:15.726
Kima aside, and just stays there, waiting
carefully.

03:54:15.726 --> 03:54:17.835
MARISHA: Scanlan does have Dimension Door.

03:54:17.835 --> 03:54:19.506
LAURA: He does. He could do it for himself.

03:54:19.506 --> 03:54:25.946
MATT: And one other person of equal size, which is
only Pike. And Kima, technically, but Kima's

03:54:25.946 --> 03:54:27.089
already gotten across.

03:54:27.089 --> 03:54:29.426
LAURA: That sucks, 'cause Scanlan could've taken
Kima.

03:54:29.426 --> 03:54:31.956
TALIESIN: Scanlan also has a plan, if you guys are
about to really fucking die.

03:54:31.956 --> 03:54:36.502
MATT: So you're just waiting. Kerrek and Keyleth
are going across. Are you guys going just directly

03:54:36.502 --> 03:54:38.655
across, or are you going towards Vex and--

03:54:38.655 --> 03:54:47.577
PATRICK: Well, if they were to fall, I'm heading
wherever below that is, toward them, to offer

03:54:47.577 --> 03:54:53.930
support if they lose it. I'm also ready to Turn
Undead if a big cluster of these things comes

03:54:53.930 --> 03:54:55.090
towards us.

03:54:55.090 --> 03:54:59.195
MARISHA: I'm maintaining concentration while
floating next to Kerr on the carpet.

03:54:59.195 --> 03:55:02.593
MATT: All right, so you guys, as the carpet heads
out, you hearing the carpet as you move forward,

03:55:02.593 --> 03:55:08.951
Kerrek, you barrel roll the carpet and begin
heading upward to float underneath where Pike and

03:55:08.951 --> 03:55:14.209
Vex will be. As you begin heading upward, it's
funny you mention that. What were singular bodies

03:55:14.209 --> 03:55:21.417
tumbling upward are now groupings. Four or five,
almost chained together, like these small balls of

03:55:21.417 --> 03:55:30.091
just limbs and bones and gnashing zombified teeth
begin just (falling sounds) upward. One of them

03:55:30.091 --> 03:55:38.371
slams into the bridge and scatters out, sending a
number of bodies spinning outward, broken arms and

03:55:38.371 --> 03:55:42.544
limbs from the impact. The bridge itself cracks a
bit, and you watch as the center of it is still

03:55:42.544 --> 03:55:46.749
being held by a rope, but it is currently not overly
walkable without holding the rope to get across.

03:55:46.749 --> 03:55:50.352
TALIESIN: You can use the rope just to steady
yourself on the carpet.

03:55:50.352 --> 03:55:55.278
MATT: One of these clusters starts making its way
upwards towards where the carpet is.

03:55:55.278 --> 03:56:04.816
PATRICK: If I'm steering the carpet, can I dodge
away from this? Because even if I Turn it, they

03:56:04.816 --> 03:56:06.043
will have velocity.

03:56:06.043 --> 03:56:15.109
MATT: Correct. You have not driven a magic carpet
before. I would ask you to go ahead and, let's

03:56:15.109 --> 03:56:17.592
see, for this? Make an intelligence check.

03:56:17.592 --> 03:56:19.014
PATRICK: Jesus is my copilot.

03:56:19.014 --> 03:56:20.416
(laughter)

03:56:20.416 --> 03:56:22.381
MATT: Go ahead and make an intelligence check,
just a straight d20

03:56:22.381 --> 03:56:23.663
plus your intelligence modifier.

03:56:23.663 --> 03:56:29.936
PATRICK: The first fucking character I make where
I lowball intelligence.

03:56:29.936 --> 03:56:31.893
(laughter)

03:56:31.893 --> 03:56:39.895
PATRICK: Oh. That is a-- just straight?

03:56:39.895 --> 03:56:42.139
MATT: Well, plus your modifier, whatever that is.

03:56:42.139 --> 03:56:44.562
PATRICK: Wait, my proficiency modifier?

03:56:44.562 --> 03:56:46.143
MATT: Your intelligence modifier.

03:56:46.143 --> 03:56:48.992
PATRICK: Oh, yeah, no. That's an eight.

03:56:48.992 --> 03:56:56.767
MATT: Okay. So, moving this across, you're
basically watching this thing come careening

03:56:56.767 --> 03:57:02.454
upwards, and you're trying to shift out of the way
to maintain momentum and have this not impact you,

03:57:02.454 --> 03:57:10.323
but both the nerves of what's happening, the
unfamiliarity with the change in gravity and not

03:57:10.323 --> 03:57:14.881
running a carpet before, you move out of the way
just as it slams into the upper corner, causing

03:57:14.881 --> 03:57:20.085
the carpet to shift and quake. Oh man.

03:57:20.085 --> 03:57:25.995
PATRICK: Can I push Keyleth hard enough to get her
to the other side?

03:57:25.995 --> 03:57:33.142
MATT: You guys were heading upward, so if you were
to kick her off, she would probably still arc

03:57:33.142 --> 03:57:38.774
upward at this point. You guys are essentially, in
theory, you're below the ravine if this were

03:57:38.774 --> 03:57:40.001
normal gravity.

03:57:40.001 --> 03:57:41.661
MARISHA: How close are we to--

03:57:41.661 --> 03:57:47.134
MATT: You guys are about 30 feet across, 'cause
the movement speed of the carpet is, if I recall,

03:57:47.134 --> 03:57:49.054
from what I told you, right, it was 30 feet?

03:57:49.054 --> 03:57:50.988
MARISHA: So we're not close to Pike and Vex.

03:57:50.988 --> 03:57:52.164
MATT: Not yet. You're halfway there.

03:57:52.164 --> 03:57:58.748
TALIESIN: Just so you know, the second my feet hit
the stone of the upper wall, I'm going to hold

03:57:58.748 --> 03:58:01.562
on-- I no longer have to repose, I've got the
spider, I'm going to

03:58:01.562 --> 03:58:03.514
double-dash towards them with the rope.

03:58:03.514 --> 03:58:09.076
MATT: So, as they get hit, Percy has just made it
up the wall to you and Pike.

03:58:09.076 --> 03:58:11.837
TALIESIN: And I'm just tying them to the rope.

03:58:11.837 --> 03:58:13.766
MATT: Double-dash got you there.

03:58:13.766 --> 03:58:19.054
MARISHA: If Kerr's kicking me off, I'm reaching
for Pike and the broom and still trying to maintain

03:58:19.054 --> 03:58:21.835
concentration while trying to reach for those
guys.

03:58:21.835 --> 03:58:28.914
MATT: Okay, well, first and foremost. First and
foremost. Oh man, this got really complicated. I

03:58:28.914 --> 03:58:43.482
love it, it's great. I-- okay. I would like both
Kerr and Keyleth to roll strength saving throws to

03:58:43.482 --> 03:58:45.658
maintain hold on the carpet.

03:58:45.658 --> 03:58:47.904
LIAM: How far are they from me?

03:58:47.904 --> 03:58:51.517
MATT: They're about-- right now? 35, 40 feet.

03:58:51.517 --> 03:58:55.643
PATRICK: You get a plus three, by the way.

03:58:55.643 --> 03:58:56.940
MARISHA: I do?

03:58:56.940 --> 03:59:04.400
MATT: Yes, you do. From being just near him. He's
so awesome that when you're near him--

03:59:04.400 --> 03:59:06.171
Paladins, man.

03:59:06.171 --> 03:59:09.246
LIAM: I'm on the very edge. Close as I can get,
right?

03:59:09.246 --> 03:59:10.495
MARISHA: 14.

03:59:10.495 --> 03:59:11.986
MATT: 14? Okay. Kerr?

03:59:11.986 --> 03:59:14.108
PATRICK: 23.

03:59:14.108 --> 03:59:23.752
MATT: You both maintain your grip on the carpet. I
will say, for the sake of this, Keyleth, make a

03:59:23.752 --> 03:59:24.812
concentration check.

03:59:24.812 --> 03:59:28.281
MARISHA: I have my advantage 'cause of Warcaster,
yeah?

03:59:28.281 --> 03:59:29.618
MATT: Yes, you do.

03:59:29.618 --> 03:59:32.784
MARISHA: That one's cocked.

03:59:32.784 --> 03:59:34.268
MATT: You just need to beat a ten.

03:59:34.268 --> 03:59:37.401
MARISHA: Okay, yeah, I beat that ten with a 26.

03:59:37.401 --> 03:59:39.759
MATT: Okay, so you maintain concentration, you
maintain hold of the carpet. The carpet rights

03:59:39.759 --> 03:59:45.972
itself, the corpses go spinning upward into the
abyss above. The carpet has now spent the rest of

03:59:45.972 --> 03:59:52.699
its turn getting into position to guard you and
Pike, just in case it's necessary. So. You guys

03:59:52.856 --> 03:59:54.673
are in place. Percy, you've tied the rope--

03:59:54.673 --> 03:59:58.218
TALIESIN: Tied them, holding onto everybody, and I
just have been yelling, pull!

03:59:58.218 --> 04:00:00.186
MARISHA: What?

04:00:00.186 --> 04:00:02.869
TALIESIN: I've got them on the rope, pull the rope
down!

04:00:02.869 --> 04:00:03.977
LAURA: That's you.

04:00:03.977 --> 04:00:05.439
TALIESIN: Who else is on that side of the--

04:00:05.439 --> 04:00:06.785
MATT: Right now, it's Kima and Allura as well.

04:00:06.785 --> 04:00:10.091
TALIESIN: Yeah, as many people as can start
running out that way.

04:00:10.091 --> 04:00:13.741
MATT: You guys all grab the rope that's currently
affixed to Percy, that hopefully you've been

04:00:13.741 --> 04:00:17.289
holding this whole time. I'm imagining you
would've.

04:00:17.289 --> 04:00:19.382
LIAM: I don't know, where's the rope? There's so
much going on.

04:00:19.382 --> 04:00:23.629
TALIESIN: I'm going to use my spider-walk ability
to actually just maintain everything and just keep

04:00:23.629 --> 04:00:26.626
an eye out and try and safety-spot everything.

04:00:26.626 --> 04:00:34.322
MATT: Okay. So you go ahead and start pulling the
rope. Kima and Allura help out. Allura's not doing

04:00:34.322 --> 04:00:36.300
much, eight, unfortunately, but Kima is.

04:00:36.300 --> 04:00:42.829
PATRICK: And we were technically below them. I'll
just bring the carpet towards them and elevator

04:00:42.829 --> 04:00:44.396
them up if I can get below.

04:00:44.396 --> 04:00:50.240
MATT: Okay, cool. So now we have Kerrek and
Keyleth. Keyleth, are you releasing the vine?

04:00:50.240 --> 04:00:52.909
Because it's currently what's holding them against
the stone wall.

04:00:52.909 --> 04:00:54.494
MARISHA: Are you grabbing onto the carpet?

04:00:54.494 --> 04:00:59.865
MATT: They both have ropes they're grabbing onto
from Percy, and they're being pulled below. Do a

04:00:59.865 --> 04:01:00.960
strength check.

04:01:00.960 --> 04:01:04.974
MARISHA: I let go, and can I switch to a Gust
cantrip to try and push us down?

04:01:04.974 --> 04:01:10.069
MATT: Gust cantrip is not gonna be strong enough
to push anyone of your weight.

04:01:10.069 --> 04:01:12.262
Cantrips are very simple.

04:01:12.262 --> 04:01:14.601
LIAM: I rolled a 19, so 21.

04:01:14.601 --> 04:01:21.278
MATT: 21, good, so between you and Kima, you both
begin to just hand-over-hand, pulling the rope as

04:01:21.278 --> 04:01:31.248
it's taut up against the edge and upward. Vex,
Pike, you both begin being pulled upwards, and

04:01:31.248 --> 04:01:40.720
Kerr, you're lifting with Keyleth, keeping that.
You guys get right to the edge. You look down as

04:01:40.720 --> 04:01:47.402
you see this one cluster of what looks to be maybe
20 or so bodies comes up, not as a ball, but what

04:01:47.402 --> 04:01:52.836
looks to be almost a giant skeletal hand made up
of smaller corpses is tumbling upward and

04:01:52.836 --> 04:01:59.390
reaching, its outstretched, large, maybe
15-foot-wide grasp towards this carpet.

04:01:59.390 --> 04:02:01.538
LAURA: Oh my god.

04:02:01.538 --> 04:02:05.313
PATRICK: I do Channel Divinity on that shit.

04:02:05.313 --> 04:02:10.711
MATT: Okay. So what is your save DC for your spell
DC?

04:02:10.711 --> 04:02:18.614
LAURA: Grog's still on the other side.

04:02:18.614 --> 04:02:20.184
TALIESIN: And Scanlan.

04:02:20.184 --> 04:02:22.214
LAURA: Oh, no, this is perfect.

04:02:22.214 --> 04:02:23.839
PATRICK: 14.

04:02:23.839 --> 04:02:36.419
MATT: 14. Okay. Hold on just a second, real fast.
So for your Channel Divinity here, it's eight plus

04:02:36.419 --> 04:02:38.774
your proficiency bonus plus your charisma
modifier.

04:02:38.774 --> 04:02:47.242
PATRICK: So eight plus... that'd be seven plus,
yeah, that's right.

04:02:47.242 --> 04:02:48.605
MATT: 15?

04:02:48.605 --> 04:02:54.083
PATRICK: 14. Oh, you're right, you're right, 15.

04:02:54.083 --> 04:02:56.819
MATT: 15, yeah. All right. Cool. So, with that.

04:02:56.819 --> 04:03:06.028
LAURA: This is a really cool setup, Matt, though.
It's really fucking badass.

04:03:06.028 --> 04:03:08.107
MARISHA: It's a pain in our ass, but it's really
awesome.

04:03:08.107 --> 04:03:11.038
LAURA: The visual of it is amazing.

04:03:11.038 --> 04:03:12.970
MATT: I'm enjoying this quite a bit.

04:03:12.970 --> 04:03:20.066
MARISHA: Dead bodies falling to the ceiling,
reaching up, yeah, no, it's cool. This is

04:03:20.066 --> 04:03:22.632
definitely a Brendan Frasier movie.

04:03:22.632 --> 04:03:25.332
LAURA: Yeah, for sure.

04:03:25.332 --> 04:03:38.747
MATT: Okay, so. As this giant, skeletal hand
reaches upwards to basically scoop up the entirety

04:03:38.747 --> 04:03:43.306
of the cluster of everyone gathered right at the
edge of this ravine, the carpet pushing them

04:03:43.306 --> 04:03:49.534
inward, it's almost gonna sandwich the party into
the palm of this, you watch as Kerrek, clutching

04:03:49.534 --> 04:03:56.832
the edge of the carpet, reaches up from beneath
his armor and grabs his own holy symbol, clutches

04:03:56.832 --> 04:04:01.733
it firm in his grasp and looks upward, shouting a
whispered word that doesn't reach anybody's ears

04:04:01.733 --> 04:04:06.901
but the ones that it's intended for. And as it
does, you watch as a piercing bit of light

04:04:06.901 --> 04:04:14.055
jettisons in an upward-- or downward direction
from your perspective-- towards this hand. As it

04:04:14.055 --> 04:04:19.212
reaches out its outstretched zombie fingers, it
bursts, and as it does, the hand is scattered

04:04:19.212 --> 04:04:25.494
outward in a small shockwave. All the bodies, once
linked, are now sent into separate, disparate

04:04:25.494 --> 04:04:31.225
spinning corpses that all reach out helplessly as
they all go scattering past upward and

04:04:31.225 --> 04:04:37.238
disappearing into the ravine above. With that
final push, you all get down on the opposite side

04:04:37.238 --> 04:04:38.817
of the ravine, safe and sound.

04:04:38.817 --> 04:04:43.583
LAURA: Oh my god. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

04:04:43.583 --> 04:04:52.316
TALIESIN: I grab you and give you a big kiss. Big,
sexy, still-tied-up makeout kiss. Hey, well done

04:04:52.316 --> 04:04:55.082
not passing out this time. Good for you.

04:04:55.082 --> 04:04:58.242
LAURA: Thanks for saving me, darling. You.

04:04:58.242 --> 04:05:00.483
MATT: Grog and Scanlan are waving from the other
side of the ravine.

04:05:00.483 --> 04:05:07.075
TALIESIN: I untie the broom and the--

04:05:07.075 --> 04:05:10.396
LAURA: Don't untie it all, I like being attached
to it.

04:05:10.396 --> 04:05:16.852
MARISHA: And I go over to Percy and I say,
smitten. Smitten.

04:05:16.852 --> 04:05:19.354
TALIESIN: I slowly start shoving Keyleth back
towards the ravine.

04:05:19.354 --> 04:05:24.845
MATT: Just Scanlan's arms crossed, and his eyes
are very wide, and he's kind of looking around.

04:05:24.845 --> 04:05:26.796
TALIESIN: Scanlan's with Grog.

04:05:26.796 --> 04:05:28.095
MATT: I know.

04:05:28.095 --> 04:05:29.856
TRAVIS: Yeah, we're just kind of watching the
fucking show.

04:05:29.856 --> 04:05:31.974
MATT: "So. What do you think?"

04:05:31.974 --> 04:05:33.529
TRAVIS: I think we just leave 'em.

04:05:33.529 --> 04:05:37.878
MATT: "Yeah, you're right, let's go." You watch as
Scanlan and Grog turn around and start walking

04:05:37.878 --> 04:05:39.247
back from where you guys came.

04:05:39.247 --> 04:05:47.458
LIAM: Hand around Kerrek's neck, pulling him in.
Thank you. Thank you. Fucking thank you.

04:05:47.458 --> 04:05:56.667
PATRICK: That... that... so this is pretty much
just a Tuesday for you guys, right?

04:05:56.667 --> 04:05:58.576
TALIESIN: It's more of a Thursday.

04:05:58.576 --> 04:06:03.634
(laughter)

04:06:03.634 --> 04:06:10.352
LAURA: I give Kerr a big hug. Thank you. Saved the
day.

04:06:10.352 --> 04:06:16.593
MATT: A giant impact, as behind you, another
sphere of these corpses slams into the bridge,

04:06:16.593 --> 04:06:20.952
causing it to snap and go limp against the upper
portion of the ravine.

04:06:20.952 --> 04:06:23.547
TALIESIN: Well, okay, how are we going to get the
last-- there's still a rope.

04:06:23.547 --> 04:06:29.247
TRAVIS: I had a question. So I take one of my five
empty jugs out of the Bag of Holding, and I go to

04:06:29.247 --> 04:06:34.260
the edge. While they were up there doing all that
shit. I look down and I just throw it straight

04:06:34.260 --> 04:06:37.494
down as hard as I can. Does it immediately go
whoop?

04:06:37.494 --> 04:06:39.708
MATT: Yep. Upwards.

04:06:39.871 --> 04:06:42.506
TALIESIN: Bit of an arc. You want to pee, don't
you?

04:06:42.506 --> 04:06:49.995
PATRICK: I see what you're doing, and I grab just
whatever, a rock or something. I try to throw it

04:06:49.995 --> 04:06:51.472
straight across.

04:06:51.472 --> 04:06:53.461
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and make a strength check.

04:06:53.461 --> 04:07:01.641
PATRICK: Because it should fall at first, but if
it's 50/50, it should fall and then fall the other

04:07:01.641 --> 04:07:03.321
way, and it'll go right across.

04:07:03.321 --> 04:07:05.023
TRAVIS: Right, so if you did a jump.

04:07:05.023 --> 04:07:09.552
LIAM: It's like Angry Birds. If you get the arc
right.

04:07:09.552 --> 04:07:14.823
TALIESIN: I've got a great idea. You grab the end
of the rope that's still tied, of our endless

04:07:14.823 --> 04:07:20.112
rope. On the count of three, Scanlan's going to
jump on your back, on the count of three, they're

04:07:20.112 --> 04:07:24.760
going to make a running jump, and we're going to
run, all of us holding like a giant game of

04:07:24.760 --> 04:07:26.148
tug-of-war, and just see if we can pull them
across like a kite.

04:07:26.148 --> 04:07:28.186
TRAVIS: I will pull you all into the chasm.

04:07:28.186 --> 04:07:30.180
MARISHA: I thought everyone was over.

04:07:30.180 --> 04:07:31.867
MATT: Scanlan and Grog.

04:07:31.867 --> 04:07:33.453
MARISHA: Son of a bitch.

04:07:33.453 --> 04:07:38.110
TALIESIN: Well, if you tie yourself to the rope,
too, no matter what, we'll be able to-- so you'll

04:07:38.110 --> 04:07:39.402
at least be tethered.

04:07:39.402 --> 04:07:44.015
TRAVIS: Can't somebody fly the carpet back over
and then-- can't Pike fly it back over, and then

04:07:44.015 --> 04:07:47.824
she and Scanlan can bamf over, and then I can just
try and make it across with the carpet.

04:07:47.824 --> 04:07:53.892
LAURA: Well, I could go over on the fucking broom
again, dear lord. How about the bodies? Are they

04:07:53.892 --> 04:07:55.282
still flying?

04:07:55.282 --> 04:07:57.867
MATT: They're still going past, and it's like
little singular ones here and there, but every now

04:07:57.867 --> 04:07:59.273
and then a cluster.

04:07:59.273 --> 04:08:02.879
LAURA: Thing is, I can put Grog in the necklace
and bring him over.

04:08:02.879 --> 04:08:04.796
MARISHA: Grog, can you backpack Scanlan?

04:08:04.796 --> 04:08:08.417
TRAVIS: Yeah. And then what?

04:08:08.417 --> 04:08:11.494
MARISHA: And jump really hard?

04:08:11.494 --> 04:08:13.196
TALIESIN: Chain of Returning?

04:08:13.196 --> 04:08:18.012
MATT: Chain of Returning is-- what's the range on
that?

04:08:18.012 --> 04:08:21.315
LAURA: 40 feet? Or is it 60 feet?

04:08:21.315 --> 04:08:24.692
TRAVIS: It is somewhere.

04:08:24.692 --> 04:08:26.272
TALIESIN: I've got a crazy idea.

04:08:26.272 --> 04:08:28.886
TRAVIS: Doesn't have a range.

04:08:28.886 --> 04:08:36.879
MATT: I want to say we have it set at a 30-foot
range. It's a big weapon.

04:08:36.879 --> 04:08:38.882
TRAVIS: Sure, I'm down with that, 30 feet.

04:08:38.882 --> 04:08:40.522
MATT: Are you attaching it to your hammer?

04:08:40.522 --> 04:08:47.551
TRAVIS: No, I'm not attuned to that. I've got the
little hammer now. Oh, sorry, the hammer, yes.

04:08:47.551 --> 04:08:51.553
MATT: So yeah, that has a furthest range of 60
feet.

04:08:51.553 --> 04:08:53.807
TRAVIS: How far across the chasm is the thing?

04:08:53.807 --> 04:08:55.271
MATT: 60 feet.

04:08:55.271 --> 04:08:58.072
MARISHA: Can you attach the Chain of Returning to
the hammer?

04:08:58.072 --> 04:09:01.850
TRAVIS: I mean, I can essentially attach it to
anything, I think.

04:09:01.850 --> 04:09:03.784
LAURA: I feel like I could go back over.

04:09:03.784 --> 04:09:06.132
TALIESIN: (laughs) Sorry.

04:09:06.132 --> 04:09:09.020
LAURA: I know, I rolled a one, though, you guys.
It was real shit.

04:09:09.020 --> 04:09:11.857
MARISHA: How much time has it been?

04:09:11.857 --> 04:09:17.196
MATT: Has passed? I'd say you've probably hit a
good minute, little over a minute since the very

04:09:17.196 --> 04:09:21.355
beginning of this endeavor. Probably a little
longer. Given time to look over it since it

04:09:21.355 --> 04:09:25.373
happened, and converse about what to do.

04:09:25.373 --> 04:09:32.023
PATRICK: I say, if we have a rope tied to her, we
could bring her back if something bad happened.

04:09:32.023 --> 04:09:39.207
LAURA: Totally, totally. All right, cool. Attach a
rope to me. I bamf Trinket out so my necklace is

04:09:39.207 --> 04:09:43.421
empty, and then I take off across the channel.

04:09:43.421 --> 04:09:45.373
TALIESIN: But we have two, are we just going to do
it twice?

04:09:45.373 --> 04:09:47.147
LAURA: Scanlan can get on the broom.

04:09:47.147 --> 04:09:50.221
TALIESIN: Oh, and Grog can get in the necklace!
That's very clever.

04:09:50.221 --> 04:09:51.888
LAURA: So I want to fly back over.

04:09:51.888 --> 04:09:53.381
MATT: All right, so.

04:09:53.381 --> 04:09:56.668
LAURA: Heart pounding, this was terrifying. I'm
sorry, buddy.

04:09:56.668 --> 04:10:01.672
MATT: You jump onto the broom, steel yourself.

04:10:01.672 --> 04:10:07.156
TALIESIN: I'm gonna anchor this rope also to
Trinket, just so there's extra weight.

04:10:07.156 --> 04:10:10.343
MATT: Trinket happily allows that anchoring
to happen.

04:10:10.343 --> 04:10:12.492
TALIESIN: All right, you guys feed it, I'm gonna
be ready.

04:10:12.492 --> 04:10:16.412
MATT: You barrel-roll across. Across the way--

04:10:16.412 --> 04:10:20.445
LAURA: I wanna try to time it so I avoid as many
as I can.

04:10:20.445 --> 04:10:27.541
MATT: There are-- there's a small cluster that
comes by, and a couple of minor individual bodies

04:10:27.541 --> 04:10:29.681
on this side. Make two dexterity saving throws.

04:10:29.681 --> 04:10:34.144
LAURA: Okay, cool, cool, cool, tight, tight,
tight. Here we go, here we go, here we go.

04:10:34.144 --> 04:10:36.137
Natural 20!

04:10:36.137 --> 04:10:38.430
MARISHA: What's up?

04:10:38.430 --> 04:10:43.392
LAURA: And that one's totally fine, too. That's a
29.

04:10:43.392 --> 04:10:47.472
MATT: You just whip past, out of the grasp. You
hear the clacking of bones--

04:10:47.472 --> 04:10:51.015
TALIESIN: I think with a natural 20, you could
steal jewelry from one of them as you went by,

04:10:51.015 --> 04:10:52.593
like, that's a nice necklace.

04:10:52.593 --> 04:10:55.010
MARISHA: Top Gun high-five!

04:10:55.010 --> 04:11:03.550
MATT: You make it across to the other side. There,
you see Scanlan waiting, arms crossed, foot

04:11:03.550 --> 04:11:11.025
tapping at an accelerated rate. Grog waiting,
finding another vase to throw, and all of a sudden

04:11:11.025 --> 04:11:15.293
you watch as Vex comes streaming across and
eventually rights herself back up to your

04:11:15.293 --> 04:11:17.516
position, her hair falling normally flat to her
side.

04:11:17.516 --> 04:11:18.806
LAURA: Oh hey, guys.

04:11:18.806 --> 04:11:20.704
MARISHA: And I give her a big high-five!

04:11:20.704 --> 04:11:22.816
MATT: You don't, 'cause you're on the other side.

04:11:22.816 --> 04:11:24.032
MARISHA: What?

04:11:24.032 --> 04:11:27.487
LIAM: She made it one way, she's gotta go back the
other way.

04:11:27.487 --> 04:11:30.894
MATT: Keyleth high-fives her from across the
ravine.

04:11:30.894 --> 04:11:33.415
MARISHA: High-five, woo!

04:11:33.415 --> 04:11:37.771
LIAM: Wait a minute. Are you saying this story
only exists in our imagination?

04:11:37.771 --> 04:11:39.653
(laughter)

04:11:39.653 --> 04:11:41.900
LAURA: Hey, Grog. Do you trust me?

04:11:41.900 --> 04:11:43.258
TRAVIS: No.

04:11:43.258 --> 04:11:45.140
LAURA: Do you wanna get in this necklace?

04:11:45.140 --> 04:11:46.027
TRAVIS: Sure.

04:11:46.027 --> 04:11:47.802
TALIESIN: He knows! Modify Memory.

04:11:47.802 --> 04:11:49.366
(laughter)

04:11:49.366 --> 04:11:50.749
TALIESIN: Back in the Matrix.

04:11:50.749 --> 04:11:52.555
LAURA: And then Scanlan.

04:11:52.555 --> 04:11:56.178
MATT: So Grog, a familiar sensation. Once you're
back in that chamber

04:11:56.178 --> 04:11:58.043
I described to you once before.

04:11:58.043 --> 04:12:05.173
LAURA: And Scanlan, I want him to affix himself to
this broom, like really tie him on here.

04:12:05.173 --> 04:12:08.928
MATT: You go to get to the broom, and he just
latches onto the side of your leg.

04:12:08.928 --> 04:12:10.825
"I'm fine here."

04:12:10.825 --> 04:12:16.424
LAURA: I still tie some rope around. I've got the
Rope of Entanglement, I can at least wrap us up.

04:12:16.424 --> 04:12:23.381
MATT: You actually magically restrain him with the
Rope of Entanglement, so he's bound in a spiral

04:12:23.381 --> 04:12:29.891
fashion to the actual broom as you get on top of
it. Begin to cross to the other side? Okay. At

04:12:29.891 --> 04:12:36.847
this point, you watch as another corpse tumbles
past, and looking downward, not a hand, but what

04:12:36.847 --> 04:12:46.296
looks like a giant face emerging, built of various
pieces of zombified corpses and bones, the mouth

04:12:46.296 --> 04:12:51.352
opening almost to try and swallow you as you zoom
over that way. Make two dexterity saving throws.

04:12:51.352 --> 04:12:54.007
The first is against the singular zombie, lower
DC.

04:12:54.007 --> 04:12:55.947
LIAM: Is she within 30 feet of me at this point?

04:12:55.947 --> 04:13:01.199
MATT: She will be in just a moment. First one
she's not, second one she will be.

04:13:01.199 --> 04:13:02.730
MARISHA: It's her and Pike?

04:13:02.730 --> 04:13:04.417
MATT: No, it's her and Scanlan.

04:13:04.417 --> 04:13:07.892
LAURA: The first one is-- I add my dexterity?

04:13:07.892 --> 04:13:09.831
MATT: Correct. Or whatever your dexterity saving
throw is.

04:13:09.831 --> 04:13:11.986
LAURA: Okay, that's a 26.

04:13:11.986 --> 04:13:15.188
MATT: First one, you zip past without an issue,
and that's when you look down and notice the giant

04:13:15.188 --> 04:13:17.390
face coming up. Second.

04:13:17.390 --> 04:13:20.682
LIAM: Wait, she's within 30 feet of me now? I'm
Blessing her.

04:13:20.682 --> 04:13:22.086
MATT: Okay.

04:13:22.086 --> 04:13:23.951
TALIESIN: Scanlan is also inspiring her.

04:13:23.951 --> 04:13:27.389
LAURA: Okay, that's good, that's good, though,
this is good. 27.

04:13:27.389 --> 04:13:33.341
MATT: 27. The mouth comes up to try and slam shut
around you, and as it comes up, you just arc out

04:13:33.341 --> 04:13:40.079
of the way. You guys watch as the jaw begins to
close, and just as these jutting pieces of broken

04:13:40.079 --> 04:13:45.950
bone, skulls, and shoulderblades that make this
weird makeshift mouth of this entity begin to

04:13:45.950 --> 04:13:50.408
close and slam shut, you watch as the broom just
barely catches out of the top of it, arcs

04:13:50.408 --> 04:13:55.656
downward, and makes it across the way without
impact. Just as Vax finishes his Blessing spell on

04:13:55.656 --> 04:14:00.840
her, you've all now made it across safely to the
other side of the ravine here.

04:14:00.840 --> 04:14:02.887
MARISHA: &lt;i&gt;Now&lt;/i&gt; I give her a high-five.

04:14:02.887 --> 04:14:08.457
LAURA: I untie Scanlan and pop Grog out.

04:14:08.457 --> 04:14:15.153
MATT: Grog, you're released. Trinket comes up to
you and starts licking the side of your face.

04:14:15.153 --> 04:14:21.054
TRAVIS: That really seemed very easy. I don't see
what the big deal was.

04:14:21.054 --> 04:14:24.047
(laughter)

04:14:24.047 --> 04:14:29.227
TALIESIN: You want to try again? I know that
you're considering it reasonably.

04:14:29.227 --> 04:14:31.916
MARISHA: Don't put these ideas in his head.

04:14:31.916 --> 04:14:33.487
MATT: So, what are you guys doing?

04:14:33.487 --> 04:14:35.713
LAURA: Move forward, I guess.

04:14:35.713 --> 04:14:38.398
MATT: All right, so you push forward--

04:14:38.398 --> 04:14:39.812
LAURA: Check for traps!

04:14:39.812 --> 04:14:41.597
MATT: Check for traps, okay.

04:14:41.597 --> 04:14:47.226
LIAM: Thank you. Thank for catching my sister,
thank you.

04:14:47.226 --> 04:14:50.304
MATT: Investigation check.

04:14:50.304 --> 04:14:51.905
LIAM: Checking for traps.

04:14:51.905 --> 04:14:53.960
LAURA: Good, I hope you rolled well.

04:14:53.960 --> 04:14:56.351
LIAM: I always roll well on this. 18.

04:14:56.351 --> 04:14:57.915
LAURA: 'Cause I rolled a one again.

04:14:57.915 --> 04:15:05.234
MATT: Wow. Better now than a moment ago. All
right, so. As you guys push forward into this dark

04:15:05.234 --> 04:15:13.507
chamber, now, the humans, I imagine you still have
your warhammer out for light, Kerrek?

04:15:13.507 --> 04:15:15.936
PATRICK: Yes.

04:15:15.936 --> 04:15:20.907
MATT: So you have enough of a radius where you can
kind of make out the scenery and such. As you

04:15:20.907 --> 04:15:27.829
progress forward about 45, 50 feet further down
this path, you see what looks to be a small

04:15:27.829 --> 04:15:35.224
structure built into the ground, almost like a
multi-tiered statue of some kind, and you hear

04:15:35.224 --> 04:15:39.587
what sounds like a very faint bit of trickling,
rushing water.

04:15:39.587 --> 04:15:41.162
LIAM: Statue of a what, please?

04:15:41.337 --> 04:15:49.502
MATT: You're not quite sure yet. As you approach,
you look at it, and it appears to be a fountain,

04:15:49.502 --> 04:15:58.070
like a small structure that contains what would be
a bowl for water, and then a central, smaller tier

04:15:58.070 --> 04:16:06.173
that opens up into a smaller bowl, and kind of a
jagged edge to it. It looks a little sinister. And

04:16:06.173 --> 04:16:12.081
at the very top looks to be a humanoid face that's
stretched into this ghastly, horrified expression

04:16:12.081 --> 04:16:22.606
of terror and gasp. From its mouth is pouring a
small trickle of water, but it is upward. And it's

04:16:22.606 --> 04:16:29.863
just spilling onto the ceiling, where it's just
pooling and separating into cracks. The path

04:16:29.863 --> 04:16:33.005
continues past it. It's just in the center of the
hallway.

04:16:33.005 --> 04:16:34.573
TRAVIS: It's going up, but we're not.

04:16:34.573 --> 04:16:35.803
MATT: Correct.

04:16:35.803 --> 04:16:38.173
MARISHA: We're just not light enough.

04:16:38.173 --> 04:16:40.756
TALIESIN: Or not close enough.

04:16:40.756 --> 04:16:44.225
PATRICK: Or we're not in the area of effect, yet.

04:16:44.225 --> 04:16:51.396
MARISHA: I reach down and I grab a little pebble
and toss it towards the fountain.

04:16:51.396 --> 04:16:57.351
MATT: Okay. You toss it towards the fountain, the
pebble clinks. And the fountain is empty, it is

04:16:57.351 --> 04:17:02.625
dry on the inside right now, on each of the lower
tiers, because the water that is being poured from

04:17:02.625 --> 04:17:07.868
this face is trickling upward and hitting the
ceiling. It's this steady, constant stream.

04:17:07.868 --> 04:17:09.573
MARISHA: Pebble.

04:17:09.573 --> 04:17:14.372
MATT: You throw the pebble into the fountain, it
just kinda comes to rest.

04:17:14.372 --> 04:17:15.949
TRAVIS: What's on the ceiling? Just flat?

04:17:15.949 --> 04:17:21.151
MATT: It looks to be just a stone ceiling, and the
water's just hitting in one particular spot. If

04:17:21.151 --> 04:17:24.161
you want to roll a perception check.

04:17:24.161 --> 04:17:26.329
TRAVIS: 16.

04:17:26.329 --> 04:17:31.483
MATT: Okay, you glance up, and from what little
bit you can see with your Darkvision, the water

04:17:31.483 --> 04:17:38.549
appears to be impacting something that has a
different surface than the ceiling stonework. It's

04:17:38.549 --> 04:17:41.797
smoother, shinier, it reflects a little bit of
light.

04:17:41.797 --> 04:17:44.037
MARISHA: How high, roughly, is the ceiling?

04:17:44.037 --> 04:17:47.862
MATT: It's about 15 feet up at this point.

04:17:47.862 --> 04:17:49.392
MARISHA: Only 15?

04:17:49.392 --> 04:17:50.833
LIAM: Is it a dead end?

04:17:50.833 --> 04:17:54.283
MATT: No, the path continues past it. Just
straight.

04:17:54.283 --> 04:17:59.182
TALIESIN: Oh, god.

04:17:59.182 --> 04:18:02.393
TRAVIS: Well, we could pour a bunch of water in
the fountain.

04:18:02.393 --> 04:18:05.620
TALIESIN: I don't know if we should touch the
water that's coming out of the fountain. I think

04:18:05.620 --> 04:18:11.609
it's coming out of a petrified human that's been
turned into a mystical source of water, is the

04:18:11.609 --> 04:18:12.978
vibe I'm getting.

04:18:12.978 --> 04:18:15.512
TRAVIS: Oh, I just meant pour water out of the
alchemy jug.

04:18:15.512 --> 04:18:17.680
LAURA: Like, into the fountain?

04:18:17.680 --> 04:18:20.639
LIAM: I'd like to move along the edge of the room,
checking for traps ahead.

04:18:20.639 --> 04:18:22.994
MATT: Okay. So Vax continues forward.

04:18:22.994 --> 04:18:28.269
LIAM: 19.

04:18:28.269 --> 04:18:36.006
MATT: Okay. So you coast ahead, keeping an eye
out. There are no traps, but you do sense that

04:18:36.006 --> 04:18:39.906
there is some mechanism involved with this
fountain.

04:18:39.906 --> 04:18:41.883
LIAM: I'm gonna stop where I am, then.

04:18:41.883 --> 04:18:42.952
MATT: Okay.

04:18:42.952 --> 04:18:52.084
TALIESIN: I'm going to walk up the wall towards,
very gingerly, doing my best to check for traps or

04:18:52.084 --> 04:18:54.866
anything unusual, towards whatever it is that the
water's hitting on the ceiling.

04:18:54.866 --> 04:18:57.044
MATT: Okay. Make an investigation check.

04:18:57.044 --> 04:19:00.702
TALIESIN: That's a natural 20.

04:19:00.702 --> 04:19:05.741
MATT: As you walk up the edge-- what's your actual
perception bonus?

04:19:05.741 --> 04:19:08.776
TALIESIN: My perception? With my perception, 28.

04:19:08.776 --> 04:19:13.181
MATT: Okay. You make it up to the top, and as you
glance in, you can see there's some sort of a

04:19:13.181 --> 04:19:21.131
green emerald-like gem that is embedded into the
ceiling that the water is just trickling onto.

04:19:21.131 --> 04:19:28.653
TALIESIN: Do I recognize the green emerald gem?
It's a green gem, or is it residuum?

04:19:28.653 --> 04:19:35.280
MATT: No, no, it is not residuum, it is not
processed whitestone. It is an emerald-like gem,

04:19:35.280 --> 04:19:41.174
although it is imperfect. It is not, you know, a
jeweler has not cut over it to make it a beautiful

04:19:41.174 --> 04:19:42.603
gem. It is a little rough.

04:19:42.603 --> 04:19:50.937
TALIESIN: And the water is hitting that gem.

04:19:50.937 --> 04:19:53.681
MATT: It's hitting the gem and it's kind of just
pooling around it and sifting into cracks and

04:19:53.681 --> 04:19:55.781
being drawn.

04:19:55.781 --> 04:20:04.620
TALIESIN: I'm feeling the urge to fuck with this.
I'm really hoping someone tells me not to.

04:20:04.620 --> 04:20:07.462
LAURA: Probably maybe leave it?

04:20:07.462 --> 04:20:09.046
LIAM: Wait half a minute, half a minute.

04:20:09.046 --> 04:20:14.399
TALIESIN: I'm going to edge towards it gently, and
I'm actually-- this is going to sound weird-- I'm

04:20:14.399 --> 04:20:17.893
going to spit at it to see at what range my spit
decides to move towards it.

04:20:17.893 --> 04:20:24.936
MATT: Okay. So you spit at it, and your spit still
kinda arcs downward, normal gravity, then it hits

04:20:24.936 --> 04:20:26.728
the water and just gets caught up in the water.

04:20:26.728 --> 04:20:30.849
TALIESIN: Okay, so it's the water itself that's
being-- something maybe in the fountain?

04:20:30.849 --> 04:20:34.753
MARISHA: Can I do an investigation? Can I do a
closer look at the fountain?

04:20:34.753 --> 04:20:36.412
MATT: Yeah, make an investigation check.

04:20:36.412 --> 04:20:40.031
MARISHA: Man, I hate investigating.

04:20:40.031 --> 04:20:42.249
LIAM: What's the light like?

04:20:42.249 --> 04:20:46.941
MATT: There is no light in this room, other than
the source of Kerr's hammer.

04:20:46.941 --> 04:20:50.593
MARISHA: 20 total on the fountain. 20.

04:20:50.593 --> 04:20:58.445
MATT: 20 on the fountain, okay. There is, best you
can tell, some magical source. This is connected

04:20:58.445 --> 04:21:00.929
to something. You're not entirely sure what.

04:21:00.929 --> 04:21:02.974
MARISHA: No gems? I don't see any gems?

04:21:02.974 --> 04:21:05.996
MATT: I mean, you see-- there's no gems based
inside the actual fountain itself.

04:21:05.996 --> 04:21:07.027
The only gem that's--

04:21:07.027 --> 04:21:08.497
MARISHA: Something magical about the fountain.

04:21:08.497 --> 04:21:10.271
MATT: Yes. There is a magical essence to it.

04:21:10.271 --> 04:21:18.766
PATRICK: I will do it if nobody else wants to. Can
you catch some of the water

04:21:18.766 --> 04:21:21.722
in a jar or container?

04:21:21.722 --> 04:21:24.552
MATT: Yeah, if you want to.

04:21:24.552 --> 04:21:30.944
PATRICK: 'Cause I look around, I don't want to
disrupt anything, but I'll just catch a little in

04:21:30.944 --> 04:21:35.900
a bottle. Once it's in the bottle, does it still
pull upward?

04:21:35.900 --> 04:21:41.111
MATT: Once you pull it in the bottle, it rests
back into regular gravity.

04:21:41.111 --> 04:21:43.594
PATRICK: Does it just smell like regular water?

04:21:43.594 --> 04:21:51.714
MATT: It smells... it smells very stagnant. Hard
water-ish, like Pirates of the Caribbean or It's a

04:21:51.714 --> 04:21:53.022
Small World.

04:21:53.022 --> 04:21:54.463
LAURA: Gross.

04:21:54.463 --> 04:22:04.275
MATT: Yeah, yeah. It's not the clearest of
Arrowhead. It's cold.

04:22:04.275 --> 04:22:06.600
MARISHA: I mean, we could have Scanlan do a Dispel
Magic on it.

04:22:06.600 --> 04:22:08.263
LAURA: Yeah.

04:22:08.263 --> 04:22:14.392
MARISHA: Dispel the fountain. Or the gem. Or I
could carve the gem out of the ceiling.

04:22:14.392 --> 04:22:18.908
TALIESIN: I'm standing next to the gem. I can pry
it out of the ceiling if we have to.

04:22:18.908 --> 04:22:20.542
MARISHA: But that means you have to touch it.

04:22:20.542 --> 04:22:23.900
LIAM: What can I see down the way I'm looking?

04:22:23.900 --> 04:22:31.525
MATT: You, looking ahead, the tunnel continues and
you're starting to see more and more of the

04:22:31.525 --> 04:22:36.083
essence of reclaimed stonework. You can see,
whereas previously this ravine was an actual

04:22:36.083 --> 04:22:45.913
semi-natural tunnel that pushed forward, the walls
begin to get more brick-like. It's looking more

04:22:45.913 --> 04:22:56.322
and more like a really, really old, for lack of a
better term, temple or structure where you can see

04:22:56.322 --> 04:22:59.601
there was care put into its design.

04:22:59.601 --> 04:23:06.325
LIAM: Okay. So the statue's in this semi-natural
chamber. And turns into more carved-out,

04:23:06.325 --> 04:23:07.467
civilized.

04:23:07.467 --> 04:23:16.865
TALIESIN: I might run down to Grog. Do you have a
spare jar or jug that I can borrow?

04:23:16.865 --> 04:23:18.546
TRAVIS: I do. What do you want for it?

04:23:18.546 --> 04:23:21.157
TALIESIN: I just want to borrow it for like five
minutes, and I'll give it back.

04:23:21.157 --> 04:23:22.578
TRAVIS: What you got for trade?

04:23:22.578 --> 04:23:25.158
(laughter)

04:23:25.158 --> 04:23:32.359
TALIESIN: I have nothing--

04:23:32.359 --> 04:23:34.136
TRAVIS: Is that an ascot you're wearing?

04:23:34.136 --> 04:23:35.685
TALIESIN: Yes, it is.

04:23:35.685 --> 04:23:37.014
TRAVIS: I'll take that.

04:23:37.014 --> 04:23:39.488
TALIESIN: It won't even fit around your neck.

04:23:39.488 --> 04:23:40.954
TRAVIS: I don't care. I want it.

04:23:40.954 --> 04:23:42.270
TALIESIN: Do you know how to tie an ascot?

04:23:42.270 --> 04:23:43.953
TRAVIS: I want to be dignified.

04:23:43.953 --> 04:23:45.671
MARISHA: I can teach you later, Grog.

04:23:45.671 --> 04:24:01.912
TALIESIN: Oh, that alone. That's adorable. I tie a
little Dickie's first day of school Christmas bow.

04:24:01.912 --> 04:24:05.639
And I take my little pin and I pin it on him.

04:24:05.639 --> 04:24:06.859
TRAVIS: Here's your jug.

04:24:06.859 --> 04:24:07.981
TALIESIN: Thank you.

04:24:07.981 --> 04:24:10.418
(laughter)

04:24:10.418 --> 04:24:18.025
TALIESIN: And I go walking back up. I have a
theory that maybe if we cover the green gem, that

04:24:18.025 --> 04:24:21.506
might do a thing, so if we start to cross and
everything goes weird, I'm going to cover the

04:24:21.506 --> 04:24:22.551
green gem.

04:24:22.551 --> 04:24:23.579
LIAM: Hey, for science.

04:24:23.579 --> 04:24:27.379
TALIESIN: For science. But let's try and leave
this room without doing anything, maybe.

04:24:27.379 --> 04:24:29.041
LIAM: Besides what you're doing?

04:24:29.041 --> 04:24:30.924
TALIESIN: I'm not gonna do anything unless
something happens.

04:24:30.924 --> 04:24:32.350
TRAVIS: How high is the ceiling?

04:24:32.350 --> 04:24:33.216
MATT: 15 feet.

04:24:33.216 --> 04:24:34.276
TRAVIS: Okay.

04:24:34.276 --> 04:24:40.745
MARISHA: Hey, Grog. If it comes to that. Don't
worry about it.

04:24:40.745 --> 04:24:41.952
MATT: So what's the plan?

04:24:41.952 --> 04:24:45.806
LIAM: Scootch forward, to the other side, looking
for traps, looking for traps.

04:24:45.806 --> 04:24:47.453
MATT: Okay, you continue to scootch forward.

04:24:47.453 --> 04:24:48.893
MARISHA: I stay with Grog and Percy.

04:24:48.893 --> 04:24:50.593
LAURA: I stand in between.

04:24:50.593 --> 04:24:54.941
MATT: Okay, so you guys stay back there. Okay,
Kima and Allura stay back, waiting for you guys to

04:24:54.941 --> 04:24:59.353
scout as well. Okay. You guys, make stealth checks
again.

04:24:59.353 --> 04:25:04.702
LAURA: I'm scared of all my dice right now. Just,
all of them.

04:25:04.702 --> 04:25:07.995
LIAM: 30.

04:25:07.995 --> 04:25:09.319
LAURA: 17.

04:25:09.319 --> 04:25:18.414
MATT: Okay. You guys begin to very, very slowly
make your way up ahead, and you watch as the path

04:25:18.414 --> 04:25:25.519
ahead of you begins to-- the ceiling begins to
grow higher and higher, and the hall begins to

04:25:25.519 --> 04:25:32.043
widen open a little bit, and begins to split in
two directions, like all of a sudden the tunnel

04:25:32.043 --> 04:25:37.295
breaks into two different paths, with the ceiling
rising and growing wider on each of those paths as

04:25:37.295 --> 04:25:42.606
it presses forward. You're starting to see
portions of it are still the cavern-type feel, but

04:25:42.606 --> 04:25:46.367
once again, you're seeing more and more sections
where it looks like all these walls at one point

04:25:46.367 --> 04:25:54.981
were carved stone and had a specific purpose, and
then over time, once again, portions of it have

04:25:54.981 --> 04:25:56.774
fallen to disuse and ruin.

04:25:56.774 --> 04:25:58.455
TALIESIN: So nothing-- the fountain did nothing?

04:25:58.455 --> 04:26:00.574
MATT: Currently not yet, no.

04:26:00.574 --> 04:26:04.608
LIAM: Fuck a duck. We've got a fork in the road.
What do you want to do?

04:26:04.608 --> 04:26:07.335
TALIESIN: Let's bring everyone towards you now. Is
it time?

04:26:07.335 --> 04:26:11.194
LIAM: Well, there's nothing immediately
dangerous-appearing.

04:26:11.194 --> 04:26:15.651
LAURA: I'm gonna try to focus on dragons again and
see if I can figure out which direction they are.

04:26:15.651 --> 04:26:18.254
MATT: Okay, so you use another spell slot.

04:26:18.254 --> 04:26:21.450
TRAVIS: We don't wanna pour anything into the
fountain?

04:26:21.450 --> 04:26:22.747
TALIESIN: I don't--

04:26:22.747 --> 04:26:28.424
TRAVIS: We did nothing to this thing that's right
here, magically pouring water out.

04:26:28.424 --> 04:26:31.348
TALIESIN: It might just be the equivalent of a big
red button.

04:26:31.348 --> 04:26:33.554
TRAVIS: I love buttons.

04:26:33.554 --> 04:26:35.660
TALIESIN: The world loves buttons.

04:26:35.660 --> 04:26:37.885
LAURA: It's up to you, Grog.

04:26:37.885 --> 04:26:40.935
TALIESIN: You have a jar of unending water if you
wanted to--

04:26:40.935 --> 04:26:49.613
MATT: Vex. The sources are still ahead of you.
They're still present and still in the direction

04:26:49.613 --> 04:26:51.021
you guys are facing.

04:26:51.021 --> 04:26:54.719
LAURA: Do I know which fork they're down?

04:26:54.719 --> 04:26:57.384
MATT: In that direction.

04:26:57.384 --> 04:27:04.057
LIAM: I'd also like to use my last instance of
Divine Sense here, at this fork in the road.

04:27:04.057 --> 04:27:14.588
MATT: 60-foot radius up there... no. There is no
sense of anything undead, fiendish, celestial.

04:27:14.588 --> 04:27:17.796
MARISHA: Nothing? No sway?

04:27:17.796 --> 04:27:21.954
MATT: Not where they currently are, no. What are
you guys doing?

04:27:21.954 --> 04:27:25.636
TALIESIN: I'm waiting for everyone else to-- I'm
circling to the other side of the green--

04:27:25.636 --> 04:27:28.814
LIAM: Are we all gathering up at this fork in the
road?

04:27:28.814 --> 04:27:30.801
TALIESIN: Yeah, if everyone's gonna cross the
room.

04:27:30.801 --> 04:27:36.191
MATT: Okay. So you just move on? Okay. You guys
continue and gather at the edge of this fork. You

04:27:36.191 --> 04:27:44.889
can see a very, very faint bit of light coming
from both sides of the fork, just glancing off a

04:27:44.889 --> 04:27:47.340
distant opposite cave wall.

04:27:47.340 --> 04:27:49.523
MARISHA: Both have light?

04:27:49.523 --> 04:27:55.143
MATT: Both have a very, very faint bit of a light
source. Two of you guys make, since you were up

04:27:55.143 --> 04:27:57.474
front first, make perception checks, if you
could.

04:27:57.474 --> 04:28:04.704
LIAM: Bupkis for me.

04:28:04.704 --> 04:28:06.077
LAURA: 24.

04:28:06.077 --> 04:28:17.593
MATT: 24? Glancing both ways, for you, it splits
off, and they both seem to curve around in almost

04:28:17.593 --> 04:28:23.448
like a rejoining direction, or at least, they get
close to it. The split is less of a split and more

04:28:23.448 --> 04:28:28.762
that there is just a large column of earth that
splits what would be a wide path. The two paths

04:28:28.762 --> 04:28:31.549
eventually seem to join again on the other side.

04:28:31.549 --> 04:28:33.801
LAURA: And there's a little bit of light coming
from the end of it?

04:28:33.801 --> 04:28:35.989
MATT: A little bit of light source. Apparently on
the other side of whatever this pillar would be,

04:28:35.989 --> 04:28:42.001
or at the other side of each of these different
paths, that it's just barely reflecting off of the

04:28:42.001 --> 04:28:46.042
cave walls, enough for it to give you the essence
that there is light further.

04:28:46.042 --> 04:28:52.387
LIAM: Should we all trot along, or should we send
us down?

04:28:52.387 --> 04:28:58.040
LAURA: Trap? You wanna look for traps? The dragons
are still in there. Just ahead.

04:28:58.040 --> 04:29:02.183
LIAM: This could be it, although we thought it
could be it twice at least.

04:29:02.183 --> 04:29:05.425
MARISHA: Do we wanna split the party, half one
way, half the other?

04:29:05.425 --> 04:29:07.235
LAURA: No, let's all stay on one side.

04:29:07.235 --> 04:29:14.201
TALIESIN: If the water were running, which
direction would the water be running down? Like,

04:29:14.201 --> 04:29:19.420
if the fountain filled-- this is just, I'm trying
to conjecture, I feel like the fountain's gonna

04:29:19.420 --> 04:29:21.260
irritate me for the rest of the god damn night.

04:29:21.260 --> 04:29:22.886
MARISHA: We can Dispel Magic the fountain.

04:29:22.886 --> 04:29:29.143
LAURA: It could just be like this could be a water
canal that we're looking at right now.

04:29:29.143 --> 04:29:33.825
MARISHA: I could also get rid of that gem. We have
options for dealing with that fountain.

04:29:33.825 --> 04:29:35.098
TALIESIN: Do it?

04:29:35.098 --> 04:29:36.817
LIAM: Well, I mean, if it's itching.

04:29:36.817 --> 04:29:42.292
PATRICK: I will say, a lot of the things that
we've touched here have been put there to hurt us

04:29:42.292 --> 04:29:43.724
if we touch them.

04:29:43.724 --> 04:29:44.865
TALIESIN: Touche.

04:29:44.865 --> 04:29:54.142
PATRICK: But also, the skull that we left behind
ambushed us, so it seems to be a horse apiece in

04:29:54.142 --> 04:29:55.700
terms of a pattern, here.

04:29:55.700 --> 04:30:00.918
TALIESIN: I figure, I think, if you've made it
this far, that you've not touched several things

04:30:00.918 --> 04:30:05.868
at this point, so. This is so obviously a-- I
know.

04:30:05.868 --> 04:30:09.552
MARISHA: I mean, if it's just a trap then it's
just a trap and we avoided it and we moved on.

04:30:09.552 --> 04:30:14.160
LIAM: All right, look, we've got two identical
passages. Do you want to flip a coin? Or can you

04:30:14.160 --> 04:30:15.744
see any benefit to either side?

04:30:15.744 --> 04:30:19.498
LAURA: It looks like they come back together. This
is just a giant separation thing.

04:30:19.498 --> 04:30:21.332
LIAM: Flip a coin?

04:30:21.332 --> 04:30:23.679
LAURA: Oh, but I have an actual coin.

04:30:23.679 --> 04:30:26.794
LIAM: Do you? Pull it out. Come on, treasurer.

04:30:26.794 --> 04:30:27.973
MATT: What are you guys doing?

04:30:27.973 --> 04:30:30.090
LIAM: We're picking a passageway.

04:30:30.090 --> 04:30:32.762
MATT: What are these guys doing? Are you catching
up with them?

04:30:32.762 --> 04:30:36.390
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'll start walking towards them.

04:30:36.390 --> 04:30:37.776
MARISHA: I hang back with Grog.

04:30:37.776 --> 04:30:39.014
MATT: Okay.

04:30:39.014 --> 04:30:44.534
MARISHA: Grog. What do you think, man?

04:30:44.534 --> 04:30:51.296
TRAVIS: I just feel like, I don't know, nothing
more sad than an empty fountain.

04:30:51.296 --> 04:30:54.291
MARISHA: What do you want to do, you want to fill
it with water?

04:30:54.291 --> 04:31:00.244
TRAVIS: Well, yeah, I feel like that's what a
fountain does. I mean, like, if you came across an

04:31:00.244 --> 04:31:03.433
empty fountain, kind of a worthless thing.

04:31:03.433 --> 04:31:07.362
MARISHA: Do you think a full fountain would help
our case in this instance?

04:31:07.362 --> 04:31:10.795
TRAVIS: I dunno.

04:31:10.795 --> 04:31:16.071
MARISHA: We can try it. Do you want to fill it
with water?

04:31:16.071 --> 04:31:19.525
TRAVIS: Yeah, kinda.

04:31:19.525 --> 04:31:25.616
MARISHA: All right. I support this endeavor if you
want to do it, Grog.

04:31:25.616 --> 04:31:30.474
TALIESIN: I hear this over the ears, and I'm gonna
slowly crawl, not too close back--

04:31:30.474 --> 04:31:33.671
MATT: Allura and Kima are, "Um, are you certain
you want to do this?"

04:31:33.671 --> 04:31:36.682
LIAM: Do what, now? Do what, now?

04:31:36.682 --> 04:31:40.431
TRAVIS: Allura, it's just an empty fountain,
right? It's gotta have a purpose.

04:31:40.431 --> 04:31:43.897
MATT: "Right. Do you know whether the purpose is a
good or a bad one?"

04:31:43.897 --> 04:31:48.687
TRAVIS: I never really get that far.

04:31:48.687 --> 04:31:53.184
MATT: "I know you've survived thus far on that
mindset. That's surprising,

04:31:53.184 --> 04:31:55.870
"but do what you will, just--"

04:31:55.870 --> 04:32:01.059
TALIESIN: Oh shit, I have a theory, now. Never
mind, I don't want to fuck with it anymore.

04:32:01.059 --> 04:32:06.982
TRAVIS: Allura, you're all smart with magic and
stuff. Why is this horribly terrified face giving

04:32:06.982 --> 04:32:09.610
water upwards on an emerald in the ceiling?

04:32:09.610 --> 04:32:11.591
MARISHA: She rolled good.

04:32:11.591 --> 04:32:20.985
MATT: She takes a moment, kind of steps forward
and looks at it. "Let me see one of your jugs."

04:32:20.985 --> 04:32:23.361
TRAVIS: Yeah, okay. What do you want for it?

04:32:23.361 --> 04:32:24.636
TALIESIN: I hand her my jug.

04:32:24.636 --> 04:32:26.865
(laughter)

04:32:26.865 --> 04:32:42.635
MATT: She takes it, sets the jug right in the
stream, and releases it, and the jug sucks up and

04:32:42.635 --> 04:32:47.623
essentially covers the gem, and the water just
kinda spills across the sides.

04:32:47.623 --> 04:32:49.267
MARISHA: And then what?

04:32:49.267 --> 04:32:54.378
MATT: "Huh. My theory was wrong."

04:32:54.378 --> 04:33:01.076
MARISHA: What? Hang on, what was your theory?
Maybe we can do process of elimination.

04:33:01.076 --> 04:33:03.544
MATT: "Well, I was trying to--" And you hear in
the distance, behind where you guys came from

04:33:03.544 --> 04:33:06.218
(impact sounds).

04:33:06.218 --> 04:33:08.142
TALIESIN: I'm moving right now.

04:33:08.142 --> 04:33:16.845
MATT: What sounds like many, many, many things
falling, cracking, impacting.

04:33:16.845 --> 04:33:20.102
MARISHA: Hey, Allura, good theory. Let's run.
Let's run.

04:33:20.102 --> 04:33:21.849
TRAVIS: We are running towards Vax and Vex.

04:33:21.849 --> 04:33:26.772
PATRICK: It just reversed the gravity in the
ravine.

04:33:26.772 --> 04:33:31.285
MATT: Which, as Kerrek says this and you all look
back, you watch as hundreds and hundreds and

04:33:31.285 --> 04:33:38.340
hundreds and hundreds of bodies are now tumbling
back down into the ravine below

04:33:38.340 --> 04:33:39.871
from where they came.

04:33:39.871 --> 04:33:42.034
LIAM: Turn down for what!

04:33:42.034 --> 04:33:45.979
(laughter)

04:33:45.979 --> 04:33:50.107
TRAVIS: That was so white. That was amazing.

04:33:50.107 --> 04:33:51.687
TALIESIN: We can make it whiter.

04:33:51.687 --> 04:33:53.010
TRAVIS: So white.

04:33:53.010 --> 04:33:54.707
MATT: Don't make this any whiter, please.

04:33:54.707 --> 04:33:55.895
LIAM: Guilty.

04:33:55.895 --> 04:33:57.650
(laughter)

04:33:57.650 --> 04:34:07.118
TRAVIS: Piano riff!

04:34:07.118 --> 04:34:11.183
TALIESIN: I may play Dungeons and Dragons on the
internet, but now I'm embarrassed.

04:34:11.183 --> 04:34:19.411
MATT: The water's still going up, and it's still
careening and falling through the cracks. It's not

04:34:19.411 --> 04:34:25.026
a very strong stream, it's just this-- like a
small faucet turned on, it's all just trickling

04:34:25.026 --> 04:34:28.852
upwards, appearing, but that gem being currently
blocked seems to have had

04:34:28.852 --> 04:34:30.953
an effect on the room behind.

04:34:30.953 --> 04:34:32.394
TALIESIN: Good to know.

04:34:32.394 --> 04:34:37.618
TRAVIS: To the right or the left?

04:34:37.618 --> 04:34:38.907
LAURA: To the right!

04:34:38.907 --> 04:34:40.745
LIAM: Going to the right, but hold on.

04:34:40.745 --> 04:34:42.308
MATT: Same marching order as before?

04:34:42.308 --> 04:34:49.007
LIAM: I'm gonna go a little bit ahead, 20 feet
ahead, looking for traps. I doubt, but I want to

04:34:49.007 --> 04:34:52.012
check for traps. Stealth and traps, stealth and
traps.

04:34:52.012 --> 04:34:53.847
MATT: You're still on the same stealth roll you
had before.

04:34:53.847 --> 04:34:58.044
LIAM: Okay, great. So traps, investigation is 18.

04:34:58.044 --> 04:35:04.190
MATT: Okay. The floor doesn't appear to be trapped
as you coast forward around the other side.

04:35:04.190 --> 04:35:06.179
LAURA: Check the ceiling. I look at the ceiling.

04:35:06.179 --> 04:35:14.679
MATT: It looks like a ceiling. It's about 25, 30
feet in height throughout this chamber.

04:35:14.679 --> 04:35:19.836
LIAM: And as we move through this passage, what do
we see as we get closer to it?

04:35:19.836 --> 04:35:30.858
MATT: As you curve around, you notice that the
rocky walls become just stone. You see these grey

04:35:30.858 --> 04:35:40.007
brick walls that begin to turn as you turn around,
you see a faint light source from a series of

04:35:40.007 --> 04:35:47.343
candleabras that mark the edges of this
square-like chamber. There are two distant cages

04:35:47.343 --> 04:35:56.282
in the far corners that seem to bear some sort of
slumped, unmoving bodies inside them. There are

04:35:56.282 --> 04:36:02.185
two pillars in the center of the room that appear
to be just strewn with carvings and glyphs from

04:36:02.185 --> 04:36:12.717
top to bottom, surrounding them entirely. Two
large scaled, crimson eggs lie placed against one

04:36:12.717 --> 04:36:20.852
side of the wall, seemingly untouched, and on the
right-hand side of the chamber, at the base of one

04:36:20.852 --> 04:36:29.994
of these cages, you see a withered and long-dead
corpse of Thordak the Cinderking, folded and

04:36:29.994 --> 04:36:37.677
sagging. You see a tome propped up against a
bookstand on the far end, marked by a singular

04:36:37.677 --> 04:36:46.669
page, where a series of bookshelves and chains
line the walls of this apparent laboratory. You

04:36:46.669 --> 04:36:56.422
see at the current opened tome across the way,
arms crossed, and reading quietly, a tall female

04:36:56.422 --> 04:37:09.210
with dark green hair and silver, shimmery-like
skin facing away from you.

04:37:09.210 --> 04:37:10.989
And we'll pick up for that next week.

04:37:10.989 --> 04:37:12.153
MARISHA: I knew it.

04:37:12.153 --> 04:37:16.217
MATT: 'Cause it is late. Patrick, are you gonna
join us for Skype next week?

04:37:16.217 --> 04:37:18.147
MARISHA: Or in LA?

04:37:18.147 --> 04:37:32.048
PATRICK: Actually, I am coming out to LA. It's an
issue of how quickly I'll be able to get to PAX

04:37:32.048 --> 04:37:33.310
afterwards.

04:37:33.310 --> 04:37:34.456
MATT: Oh, shit!

04:37:34.456 --> 04:37:42.435
PATRICK: 'Cause I'm doing PAX South after my LA
trip. Really hoping that I will be in your neck of

04:37:42.435 --> 04:37:50.371
the woods Thursday night. If not, if you want me
around for the finish, I would happily Skype in

04:37:50.371 --> 04:37:56.675
from San Antonio or wherever that is. Up to you.

04:37:56.675 --> 04:37:58.660
LAURA: Ash might be able to Skype in, too.

04:37:58.660 --> 04:38:02.841
MATT: Dual Skype, maybe. Well, let us know, please
do.

04:38:02.841 --> 04:38:05.004
PATRICK: I would be delighted.

04:38:05.004 --> 04:38:10.182
TALIESIN: Thank you for handling Skype so well. It
is not easy to be on the other side of that

04:38:10.182 --> 04:38:11.550
camera. It's so frustrating.

04:38:11.550 --> 04:38:18.611
PATRICK: It's certainly not as nice as being up
close and personal with you all, but I'm just glad

04:38:18.611 --> 04:38:24.429
that I am not experiencing vast technical eras--
eras, yes, errors.

04:38:24.429 --> 04:38:29.338
LIAM: Well, we're glad to have you.

04:38:29.338 --> 04:38:32.040
MATT: Yeah, thanks so much. All right, well we'll
be--

04:38:32.040 --> 04:38:33.872
LAURA: Thanks for saving us, Kerr!

04:38:33.872 --> 04:38:37.519
PATRICK: (laughs) There was a delightful amount of
mutual saving.

04:38:37.519 --> 04:38:45.174
MARISHA: And, as always, don't forget to tune in
for Talks Machina on Tuesday night with Brian

04:38:45.174 --> 04:38:52.320
Foster. I'm sure he's going to have at least two
of us.

04:38:52.320 --> 04:38:59.568
MATT: That will be announced as the week
progresses.

04:38:59.568 --> 04:39:04.170
MARISHA: Throughout the week, I'm sure, he will
announce two of us.

04:39:04.170 --> 04:39:09.618
MATT: Also, as a heads-up, guys, once again, big
thank you to Loot Crate for being our fantastic

04:39:09.618 --> 04:39:15.528
sponsor starting in the new year. They were
awesome enough to let us tonight be the first to

04:39:15.528 --> 04:39:21.536
announce their February theme, as their previous
theme ended. The theme is 'build' for this one,

04:39:21.536 --> 04:39:27.624
and the brands that are included in that include
Power Rangers, Batman, Lego, Tetris, things that

04:39:27.624 --> 04:39:32.493
involve building, construct, that type of a feel,
so more information will be coming out with that,

04:39:32.493 --> 04:39:36.251
but 'build' is the next theme. Check out
lootcrate.com for the full reveal of everything

04:39:36.251 --> 04:39:40.136
they're gonna have in there, and don't forget to
use the promo code 'criticalrole', one word, for

04:39:40.136 --> 04:39:41.799
the discount when you sign up.

04:39:41.799 --> 04:39:43.554
(cheering)

04:39:43.554 --> 04:39:46.950
MARISHA: I hope they got those Tetris stickers
again that they had a year ago, those Tetris

04:39:46.950 --> 04:39:48.231
stickers were dope.

04:39:48.231 --> 04:39:52.781
MATT: We'll see what they got. Thank you guys so
much, rest well, you guys as well. We'll see you

04:39:52.781 --> 04:39:56.088
next week, and is it Thursday yet? Have a good
night!

04:39:56.088 --> 04:39:59.203
TRAVIS: Nice one!

04:39:59.203 --> 04:40:07.428
