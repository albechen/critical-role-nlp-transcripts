00:00:00.286 --> 00:00:05.515
MATT: Welcome, everyone, to today's special
edition of Critical Role, where a number of us are

00:00:05.515 --> 00:00:10.626
going to be playing a fantastic game in the realm
of Mordor, thanks to our fantastic sponsor for

00:00:10.626 --> 00:00:17.831
this event, WB Games! We're putting this together
in celebration of the release of their upcoming

00:00:17.831 --> 00:00:23.723
game, Shadow of War, for Xbox and Playstation,
which all of us have worked on, actually, for an

00:00:23.723 --> 00:00:28.705
extended period of time. Let's see. Well, first
off, Travis, who'd you play in the game?

00:00:28.705 --> 00:00:34.841
TRAVIS: I played Commanding Orc #1, 
and I scream like this and I will be

00:00:34.841 --> 00:00:40.810
chasing you as you try and make your way through
the lands, and I escalate my ambitions through the

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:43.452
war ranks! I just made that up.

00:00:43.452 --> 00:00:47.625
MATT: So kill him immediately. Laura, who'd you
play in the game?

00:00:47.625 --> 00:00:49.061
LAURA: I don't play an orc.

00:00:49.061 --> 00:00:50.853
MATT: No. Who do you play?

00:00:50.853 --> 00:00:54.793
LAURA: I play Eltariel, also known as the Blade of
Galadriel.

00:00:54.793 --> 00:00:56.123
TRAVIS: She's super bad.

00:00:56.123 --> 00:01:01.125
LAURA: I'm a super cool and I have, like, daggers,
and I can kick a lot of butt.

00:01:01.125 --> 00:01:03.044
MATT: That's a great little view of the character,
there.

00:01:03.044 --> 00:01:04.133
LAURA: Thanks.

00:01:04.133 --> 00:01:05.475
TRAVIS: Just like a normal elf.

00:01:05.475 --> 00:01:07.724
LAURA: That's exactly how I recorded it.

00:01:07.724 --> 00:01:10.182
MATT: Perfect. Sam, what'd you do?

00:01:10.182 --> 00:01:22.523
SAM: I played a character named Orc 4, who, among
other things, hates humans. Enjoys grog. And is dumb.

00:01:22.523 --> 00:01:24.303
LAURA: How does he feel about elves?

00:01:24.303 --> 00:01:27.864
SAM: Oh, I think he hates them? I think he hates
most things.

00:01:27.864 --> 00:01:30.234
TRAVIS: Not a very affable--

00:01:30.234 --> 00:01:38.355
SAM: No, he just hates. He's a hater. Really, they
should spend more of the game talking about his

00:01:38.355 --> 00:01:42.656
wants and needs, and his ambitions and likes in
life, but no.

00:01:42.656 --> 00:01:44.566
TRAVIS: Does he hate the player, or does he hate
the game?

00:01:44.566 --> 00:01:48.937
SAM: He hates both. Just hates a lot of stuff.

00:01:48.937 --> 00:01:53.583
MATT: That's perfect. Well, thank you, Sam. Mr.
Darin De Paul?

00:01:53.583 --> 00:01:55.124
DARIN: Hi, internet friends!

00:01:55.124 --> 00:01:58.215
MATT: Hi! What'd you play in the game?

00:01:58.215 --> 00:02:05.790
DARIN: I am a massive olog, but he became-- one of
them became kind of notorious. Az-Laar the

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:12.299
Demolisher. There were, like, "RIP Az-Laar." There
were tribute videos to Az-Laar. People played sad

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:18.891
music when Az-Laar died. It was amazing. (deep
gruff voice) A big dumb thing, but he died from

00:02:18.891 --> 00:02:23.210
flames! (normal voice) And people were very upset,
so they were playing tinkling music and going,

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:25.919
"Rest in Peace, Az-Laar! We hardly knew you."

00:02:25.919 --> 00:02:28.169
LAURA: That was in the previous--?

00:02:28.169 --> 00:02:33.727
DARIN: No, in this one. I was not in the previous.
I wasn't here yet. I had not come to California

00:02:33.727 --> 00:02:38.188
yet. I was still in New York going, 
I really hope I get to do stuff like that!

00:02:38.188 --> 00:02:39.806
It's really fun!

00:02:39.806 --> 00:02:42.034
TRAVIS: You hear Darin and you're like, he was
definitely an orc forever.

00:02:42.034 --> 00:02:43.175
LAURA: Yeah.

00:02:43.175 --> 00:02:47.260
DARIN: It's only been, it's a little over four
years that I have been among the people that I

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.628
admire most. It makes my heart so happy.

00:02:49.628 --> 00:02:51.286
SAM: Feels like too long.

00:02:51.286 --> 00:02:55.582
DARIN: Thank you! And we haven't even started the
episode.

00:02:55.582 --> 00:03:02.217
MATT: Perfect. But glad you could join us, Darin.
I play a professional orc

00:03:02.217 --> 00:03:07.114
who's going to follow you around
everywhere, trying make sure that you're working

00:03:07.114 --> 00:03:10.749
it out. Where are you going, there? I'm going to
cut your throat, bastard! And I

00:03:10.749 --> 00:03:17.084
also get to play-- I'm really excited about this,
as a longtime Tolkien fan-- the Witch-king of

00:03:17.084 --> 00:03:22.658
Angmar, head of the NazgÅ±l. As a person that grew
up reading Tolkien fervently and spending two and

00:03:22.658 --> 00:03:27.199
a half years playing a MUD based on Tolkien, and
then, you know, the movies and everything-- huge

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:31.670
honor to be a part of this, let alone such an
iconic character. So, super excited. Super excited

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:35.548
for this game, and those of you who haven't played
the first game, Shadow of Mordor, what's wrong

00:03:35.548 --> 00:03:41.898
with you? It's legitimately a really fun game and
this one expands even more on how awesome that

00:03:41.898 --> 00:03:46.557
was, so super excited. Thank you so much to WB
Games for making this possible. You guys can check

00:03:46.557 --> 00:03:50.288
it out, Shadow of War releases October 10th, which
is right around the corner when this is airing,

00:03:50.288 --> 00:03:56.266
which is exciting. You can find it at
shadowofwar.com/purchase to go ahead and find out

00:03:56.266 --> 00:04:02.080
how to buy and pre-order it if you want to. Also,
a mobile game should be out by now. Shadow of War

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:07.469
has a mobile game for both iOS and Android that
you can get as well, so check that out. But yeah,

00:04:07.469 --> 00:04:12.049
this whole game is a big celebration of the
upcoming release of Shadow of War. We're stoked to

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:18.748
be in it, and we're stoked to have you here.
Without further ado, guys, let's go ahead and dive

00:04:18.748 --> 00:04:25.907
into the world of Mordor, shall we? Actually,
before we begin, because we haven't actually

00:04:25.907 --> 00:04:28.989
established here, do you guys want to talk about
who you're playing in this game?

00:04:28.989 --> 00:04:34.070
TRAVIS: Oh gosh, I guess we should, being that we
don't even know. We're figuring it out as we go.

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:35.375
Should I start?

00:04:35.375 --> 00:04:36.680
LAURA: Yeah, sure!

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:46.253
TRAVIS: (high squeaky voice) So I'm playing: I am
Skak Scar-Artist, and I'm a goblin. A trickster.

00:04:46.253 --> 00:04:54.807
Very creepy! Yeah. I'm a little goblin that's got
a crossbow and a shortsword, and I'm here to run

00:04:54.807 --> 00:05:03.380
amok and advance, you know, my efforts against
the horrible humans and elves of the land of

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:04.252
Mordor.

00:05:04.252 --> 00:05:07.828
DARIN: This could be my favorite day ever.

00:05:07.828 --> 00:05:12.730
MATT: I'm already so invested in everything. Thank
you, Travis. Laura?

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:19.380
LAURA: Oh. Hi, my name is
Arburuk. I'm the Unbreakable because people have

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:30.131
tried but nobody was able to actually break me.
I'm olog-hai, so I'm kind of big. But you know, I

00:05:30.131 --> 00:05:34.920
don't necessarily want to be a fighter, I'm just
really good at it, you know? Because I'm

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:37.683
unbreakable and all. Yeah.

00:05:37.683 --> 00:05:41.660
MATT: Thank you, Laura. Darin?

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:51.760
DARIN: There's two things you have to
know about me. My name is Mozuu the Chosen, and

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:53.180
that's it!

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:55.450
SAM: Nice.

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:58.903
LAURA: That was two things!

00:05:58.903 --> 00:06:00.513
MATT: And Sam, who are you playing?

00:06:00.513 --> 00:06:02.490
SAM: (raspy voice) Hello.

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:06.591
DARIN: You all right, mate?

00:06:06.591 --> 00:06:08.250
SAM: (rasping) Hello.

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:10.401
DARIN: We got that part.

00:06:10.401 --> 00:06:19.977
SAM: My name is Ur-Eden Goodthink, and I'm the
olog you want to see if you're hurt. Because me is

00:06:19.977 --> 00:06:21.630
a sawbones.

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:24.029
LAURA: You're an olog, too?

00:06:24.029 --> 00:06:29.267
SAM: I'm an olog, so I'm rather big. But I'm also
a sawbones, which means if you have a toothache

00:06:29.267 --> 00:06:34.602
or something, you come to me, I pull the tooth
right out. Probably half of your jaw, too. If you

00:06:34.602 --> 00:06:43.135
got a broken bone, I pull the arm off. If you got
a rash, I pull your skin off. So really, I take

00:06:43.135 --> 00:06:52.190
care of all your medical needs. Somebody came to
me with-- they were having some stress dreams. I

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:56.269
ripped their head off. Solved the problem right
away!

00:06:56.269 --> 00:06:57.741
TRAVIS: Great outpatient.

00:06:57.741 --> 00:07:06.967
SAM: Yeah. Usually most things can be solved
without insurance. But yeah, I'm here to help

00:07:06.967 --> 00:07:11.192
anyone who gets injured, and also to kill some
man-filth.

00:07:11.192 --> 00:07:25.311
MATT: Perfect. So. Players and audience, welcome
to Mordor. Chosen as the base to Sauron's foothold

00:07:25.311 --> 00:07:31.332
in the Second Age, these broken, ashen lands to
the southeast of Middle-earth lay guarded by

00:07:31.332 --> 00:07:38.020
towering mountain ranges, ever dark beneath
stormclouds and volcanic smoke spewed from within

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:45.741
the fiery depths of Orodruin, or Mount Doom. Here
in the Third Age, the once-thought-destroyed Dark

00:07:45.741 --> 00:07:53.181
Lord regains his strength, grows his armies, and
prepares for his vengeance on the world of man and elves.

00:07:53.181 --> 00:08:02.422
You, friends, are soldiers and warriors under this
shadowed banner. Whether Uruk- or Olog-hai, you've

00:08:02.422 --> 00:08:06.742
been raised and trained in the savage pits and
fields of these lands, given purpose amongst the

00:08:06.742 --> 00:08:13.422
ranks of Sauron's great army, taught to slaughter,
to devour, to outsmart and destroy all who would

00:08:13.422 --> 00:08:19.421
oppose his will, or be punished for your
insolence. You relish the thought of sinking your

00:08:19.421 --> 00:08:24.421
blades into elf-flesh, eager for the chance to
prove yourself and rise among your fellow uruk to

00:08:24.421 --> 00:08:30.981
command greater power-- and the rewards that come
with it, of course. However, such a path is not as

00:08:30.981 --> 00:08:34.272
easy as the daydream would lead you to believe.

00:08:34.272 --> 00:08:40.122
Now, you four have spent months stationed on the
outskirts of the watch-fortress of Nargaroth, on

00:08:40.122 --> 00:08:46.801
the eastern edge of the massive Plateau of
Gorgoroth, many miles southeast of Mount Doom. As

00:08:46.801 --> 00:08:52.381
part of the Marauder tribe, you've been sent on a
few raids here and there, between here and the Sea

00:08:52.381 --> 00:08:56.773
of Nurnen, scrounging up what meager spoils are
left when the bulk is brought to the feet of your

00:08:56.773 --> 00:09:05.031
war-chief, Barfta the Blood Pike. While you both
dislike and respect his greed, you've seen him

00:09:05.031 --> 00:09:10.443
carve every challenger to his position to pieces
as a show of power. You hope to show him your

00:09:10.443 --> 00:09:16.734
worth and achieve greatness under his specific
banner. At least, that would help you with your

00:09:16.734 --> 00:09:22.959
limited access to quality meats or being sent out
on aimless patrols that try your patience. Maybe

00:09:22.959 --> 00:09:24.604
one day.

00:09:24.604 --> 00:09:29.642
For now, you sit amongst the rowdy riff-raff of
the common tables in the fort courtyard, drinking

00:09:29.642 --> 00:09:34.823
from watered-down grog as you all celebrate a
fairly unimpressive crushing of a not-too-far-away

00:09:34.823 --> 00:09:42.212
ghul mound. You four have bonded out of a need for
allies, for boredom here leads to violence, and

00:09:42.212 --> 00:09:48.353
it's good to have friends when the brawls begin.
The late afternoon sees fading off what specter of

00:09:48.353 --> 00:09:53.558
sunlight ever finds itself in Mordor, and the
smell of burnt meats and blood fills the air.

00:09:53.558 --> 00:09:58.602
Welcome.

00:09:58.602 --> 00:10:08.540
You hear the clanking of glasses and partially
cracked mugs nearby. The cheers and rowdy screams

00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:14.853
and yells of various half-drunken uruk in your
vicinity, (shouting). You see two guys in the back

00:10:14.853 --> 00:10:18.373
far corner that are in the middle of a fist-fight
with a small crowd gathering, but it's too measly

00:10:18.373 --> 00:10:23.483
for your attention. You all sit here, staring into
your cups, contemplating your existence.

00:10:23.483 --> 00:10:25.756
TRAVIS: (high-pitched whining)

00:10:25.756 --> 00:10:29.995
LAURA: What's the matter, Skak?

00:10:29.995 --> 00:10:32.544
TRAVIS: I'm just bored, that's all.

00:10:32.544 --> 00:10:38.364
SAM: Do you want to go with me to kill something?
Would that break your boredom?

00:10:38.364 --> 00:10:42.021
TRAVIS: Is that an option? We could do that, now?

00:10:42.021 --> 00:10:46.164
SAM: Well, those two fellows having the fist
fight, we could go kill one of them.

00:10:46.164 --> 00:10:47.619
TRAVIS: Ooh!

00:10:47.619 --> 00:10:52.685
SAM: I think it's Rarr versus Oog, over there.

00:10:52.685 --> 00:10:56.554
TRAVIS: Naw, I think it's Oog, and it's actually
Oop-tha.

00:10:56.554 --> 00:10:58.225
SAM: You could be right.

00:10:58.225 --> 00:10:59.864
TRAVIS: Yeah, you get them easily confused.

00:10:59.864 --> 00:11:01.304
LAURA: They look a lot alike.

00:11:01.304 --> 00:11:04.353
SAM: Yeah, they do. All the uruks do.

00:11:04.353 --> 00:11:10.753
DARIN: Is that what you really want? You just want
to fight and bleed for nothing, or do we want

00:11:10.753 --> 00:11:13.911
gold? Ain't that what we're after?

00:11:13.911 --> 00:11:15.334
LAURA: I like gold!

00:11:15.334 --> 00:11:24.122
DARIN: Of course you like gold. We all like gold!
And I say we find it. While they're fighting and

00:11:24.122 --> 00:11:32.715
they're dying for nothing, we make our way up and
we rule this world, eh?

00:11:32.715 --> 00:11:35.584
LAURA: But I thought Barfta ruled this world.

00:11:35.584 --> 00:11:44.093
DARIN: There's two things you have to know about
Barfta. One, he &lt;i&gt;thinks&lt;/i&gt; he rules! And that's it.

00:11:44.093 --> 00:11:47.264
TRAVIS: He keeps doing this, with the two things.

00:11:47.264 --> 00:11:48.524
DARIN: What?

00:11:48.524 --> 00:11:51.454
TRAVIS: Nothing. You're always-- I'm a fan of gold
as well.

00:11:51.454 --> 00:11:57.034
DARIN: Well said, my friend. You see this gold
helmet that I stole?

00:11:57.034 --> 00:11:58.474
LAURA: Is that gold?

00:11:58.474 --> 00:12:04.247
DARIN: Of course it's gold! Don't mind the
man-filth head on the pike on the helmet, ha!

00:12:04.247 --> 00:12:12.064
That's ornamentation. But you know what you
aren't? You aren't the head of man-filth on my

00:12:12.064 --> 00:12:18.795
helmet. You're alive. And while we're alive, we
make a difference. Eh?

00:12:18.795 --> 00:12:20.551
TRAVIS: Yeah, that's true.

00:12:20.551 --> 00:12:27.039
MATT: It's that exact moment that a heavy nudge
slaps into the back of Mozuu. You watch a

00:12:27.039 --> 00:12:33.771
familiar, lanky, nasty-looking uruk with large,
broken teeth and a wiry physicality slamming into

00:12:33.771 --> 00:12:39.385
him, his large cup of thick, brackish grog
spilling over and across your shoulder as he spins

00:12:39.385 --> 00:12:45.405
around to stare down at you, Mozuu. You recognize
this as Hoshgrish Bootlick.

00:12:45.405 --> 00:12:47.945
SAM: Hoshgrish?

00:12:47.945 --> 00:12:54.535
MATT: Hoshgrish Bootlick. He turns around. "What
you doing, bumping my drink, lob?"

00:12:54.535 --> 00:12:59.924
LAURA: It's Hoshgrish. He's such a bully.

00:12:59.924 --> 00:13:02.526
DARIN: Come here. Come closer, Hoshgrish.

00:13:02.526 --> 00:13:06.574
MATT: "Oh, I'm doing just fine right here! Will
you go ahead and refill my drink!" And he puts his

00:13:06.574 --> 00:13:08.935
cup right on the table in front of you.

00:13:08.935 --> 00:13:15.036
DARIN: Skak! Refill his drink while I have a
little word with Hoshgrish.

00:13:15.036 --> 00:13:20.303
TRAVIS: Not a problem. Could I have, could you
hand me--? It's really high up there, right.

00:13:20.303 --> 00:13:21.960
DARIN: You're ruining the moment, Skak!

00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:23.770
TRAVIS: Okay! I've got it!

00:13:23.770 --> 00:13:28.600
DARIN: What's your problem, mate? We're just sitting
here having a little discussion. You wander up

00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:34.131
drunkenly, you bump into me! At least you didn't
get wine on the helmet. And now you're looking for

00:13:34.131 --> 00:13:38.549
trouble? Is that what you're looking for,
Hoshgrish Bootlick?

00:13:38.549 --> 00:13:43.800
MATT: As he wipes the bit of spittle from the
bottom of his pointed, jagged chin, he looks down

00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:51.927
at you with a sly grin, his overbite curling back
as it exposes with the smile. "Heh heh! You

00:13:51.927 --> 00:13:59.466
"obviously haven't seen the last one who bumped
into me when I was drinking! So you want to start

00:13:59.466 --> 00:14:06.830
"a problem? Please, be my guest." He takes a few
steps back and you watch as his hands go down to

00:14:06.830 --> 00:14:11.847
pull two jagged, black blades from the side. He
spins and tosses them in the air and catches them.

00:14:11.847 --> 00:14:17.060
LAURA: Hey. You mess with Mozuu, you mess with
me.

00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:25.311
MATT: "Well look here, I don't have any sort of a
problem with you, friend olog, but you understand.

00:14:25.311 --> 00:14:29.608
"I've had my drink disrespected and I'll take a
head for that!"

00:14:29.608 --> 00:14:34.839
LAURA: Oh. Oh! Oh, well, he was, his drink was
disrespected, that's all it is.

00:14:34.839 --> 00:14:36.517
MATT: "Thank you."

00:14:36.517 --> 00:14:38.975
DARIN: Skak, you got that drink for him yet?

00:14:38.975 --> 00:14:40.878
TRAVIS: Was I supposed to do that?

00:14:40.878 --> 00:14:42.457
DARIN: Yes.

00:14:42.457 --> 00:14:45.921
TRAVIS: Yeah, hold on one more second.

00:14:45.921 --> 00:14:54.870
DARIN: We'll refill your drink, friend, but know,
they call me Mozuu the Chosen because Sauron spoke

00:14:54.870 --> 00:15:01.283
to me. You know what he said? "The strong take
what they want."

00:15:01.283 --> 00:15:04.441
MATT: "The Dark Lord spoke to you?"

00:15:04.441 --> 00:15:06.453
DARIN: Aye, he did. That's--

00:15:06.453 --> 00:15:11.604
MATT: "What a load of serak!" He puts his blades
back in, like now disinterested, completely shut

00:15:11.604 --> 00:15:13.699
off from the conversation. "Give me my drink."

00:15:13.785 --> 00:15:15.229
TRAVIS: Yeah, here you go.

00:15:15.273 --> 00:15:22.385
MATT: "Thank you. 'Mozuu the Chosen.'" Turns
around and starts walking away.

00:15:22.385 --> 00:15:27.159
SAM: Is that true? Did Sauron really talk to you?

00:15:27.159 --> 00:15:32.093
DARIN: Of course it's true. Everything I say is
true, except the things that ain't, but that is true.

00:15:32.093 --> 00:15:37.531
SAM: Because sometimes I hear voices, but then I
turn around and it's just an orc talking to me

00:15:37.531 --> 00:15:39.098
that I didn't see.

00:15:39.098 --> 00:15:41.165
LAURA: Sometimes I'm talking to you, sometimes
but--

00:15:41.165 --> 00:15:42.508
SAM: Yeah, but I didn't see you.

00:15:42.508 --> 00:15:44.899
LAURA: Yeah. Sometimes. Because your helmet blocks
the view, you know.

00:15:44.899 --> 00:15:47.007
SAM: Yeah, that's the problem with these things.

00:15:47.007 --> 00:15:51.291
DARIN: We all hear voices when people are talking
in our general vicinity, but this was in my head.

00:15:51.291 --> 00:15:53.457
This was in my head, I heard it.

00:15:53.457 --> 00:15:55.368
LAURA: What's he sound like?

00:15:55.368 --> 00:16:03.866
DARIN: Well, scary. Large. And he sounds like
Sauron. He sounds like a Dark Lord. He sounds like

00:16:03.866 --> 00:16:05.717
someone who should be obeyed.

00:16:05.717 --> 00:16:07.218
SAM: You know what he sounds like to me?

00:16:07.218 --> 00:16:08.178
DARIN: What?

00:16:08.178 --> 00:16:12.528
SAM: A medical condition. I should probably get my
axe, chop up your head, and see what's in there

00:16:12.528 --> 00:16:13.530
making that noise.

00:16:13.530 --> 00:16:15.072
LAURA: Maybe just the top of it.

00:16:15.072 --> 00:16:21.573
DARIN: Wait. There's two things you should do with
that axe. One, put it away. And that's it.

00:16:21.573 --> 00:16:23.029
SAM: All right.

00:16:23.029 --> 00:16:24.928
LAURA: He's so good at math.

00:16:24.928 --> 00:16:32.042
MATT: As this conversation's taking place, you
hear this massive, echoing explosion right over

00:16:32.042 --> 00:16:37.530
your shoulders as you see a flash of light and
heat brighten the courtyard around you. Everyone

00:16:37.530 --> 00:16:42.420
in the vicinity looks up past. You can see one of
the three large towers that sits in the courtyard

00:16:42.420 --> 00:16:49.753
of this fortress. The tower of Warchief Barfta is
currently in flames, his chamber being burned as

00:16:49.753 --> 00:16:55.097
the thatch and mud that comprises its exterior are
beginning to burn. You can see now everyone's

00:16:55.138 --> 00:16:59.588
mobilizing around you, grabbing weapons as a
series of arrows come arcing in from over one of

00:16:59.588 --> 00:17:03.925
the walls. Three or four nearby uruk go (dying
sounds) and fall to the ground, dead immediately.

00:17:03.925 --> 00:17:07.508
LAURA: I take a helmet off one and put it in my
bag.

00:17:07.508 --> 00:17:10.319
MATT: All right, what are you guys doing?

00:17:10.319 --> 00:17:13.439
TRAVIS: I take out a crossbow, do I see any
intruders?

00:17:13.439 --> 00:17:15.101
MATT: Perception check, please.

00:17:15.101 --> 00:17:18.577
LAURA: Isn't that where Barfta lives up there?

00:17:18.577 --> 00:17:19.687
SAM: Yes.

00:17:19.687 --> 00:17:21.195
LAURA: And it's on fire?

00:17:21.195 --> 00:17:22.285
TRAVIS: 12!

00:17:22.285 --> 00:17:26.529
MATT: 12, okay! You glance around rapidly and you
see people running back and forth and you can see

00:17:26.529 --> 00:17:33.068
guards along the wall, but the guards are firing
inward. You see three or four uruk up on the edge

00:17:33.068 --> 00:17:37.821
of the perimeter wall that are currently loading
up their crossbows or shortbows and are ready to

00:17:37.821 --> 00:17:40.456
fire another volley into the crowd currently
drinking.

00:17:40.456 --> 00:17:44.231
TRAVIS: I don't understand! Those are uruk! Why
are they firing at us?

00:17:44.231 --> 00:17:46.157
LAURA: Because they need to die!

00:17:46.157 --> 00:17:49.709
SAM: Let's go get them!

00:17:49.709 --> 00:17:50.872
TRAVIS: Yeah!

00:17:50.872 --> 00:17:55.606
SAM: Let's go! I pick up my quarterstaff and start
stomping towards the tower.

00:17:55.606 --> 00:17:58.010
LAURA: Ditto with my maul.

00:17:58.010 --> 00:18:01.063
MATT: All righty. You follow as well?

00:18:01.063 --> 00:18:02.948
DARIN: I follow, behind them.

00:18:02.948 --> 00:18:04.977
SAM: That's where good leaders go.

00:18:04.977 --> 00:18:06.296
DARIN: Yes!

00:18:06.296 --> 00:18:11.127
MATT: So as Mozuu's picking up the rear you can
see other goblins and uruk rushing past. You see

00:18:11.127 --> 00:18:15.289
another volley get loosed towards it. I need all
of you to make dexterity saving throws, please.

00:18:15.289 --> 00:18:16.357
LAURA: Oh no!

00:18:16.357 --> 00:18:18.939
TRAVIS: Oh, shit!

00:18:18.939 --> 00:18:24.218
LAURA: What did you get?

00:18:24.218 --> 00:18:25.361
TRAVIS: One.

00:18:25.361 --> 00:18:27.509
SAM: I also got a one.

00:18:27.509 --> 00:18:28.875
LAURA: Oh no!

00:18:28.875 --> 00:18:30.473
MATT: Off to a great start!

00:18:30.473 --> 00:18:31.418
DARIN: Ten!

00:18:31.418 --> 00:18:32.420
MATT: Ten, all right!

00:18:32.420 --> 00:18:33.368
LAURA: 14.

00:18:33.368 --> 00:18:37.702
MATT: All right. Both Mozuu and Arburuk manage
to--

00:18:37.702 --> 00:18:39.854
LAURA: You can call me Arby.

00:18:39.854 --> 00:18:47.254
MATT: Arby. Mozuu and Arby, rushing forward, you
manage to get behind Arby as the heavy plates of

00:18:47.254 --> 00:18:52.008
armor that surround your large, troll-like form,
the arrows smash against. You two not so lucky.

00:18:52.008 --> 00:18:58.079
You both suffer six points of piercing damage as a
series of bolts or arrows stick into your chest

00:18:58.079 --> 00:19:02.978
and shoulders. You flex and tear them off as you
rush forward towards the side of the tower before

00:19:02.978 --> 00:19:06.064
you now, the smoke billowing off the top of the
inferno.

00:19:06.064 --> 00:19:13.985
LAURA: I step in front of Skak here to try to
block him from any more arrows coming. I'm a

00:19:13.985 --> 00:19:16.825
defender, you know.

00:19:16.825 --> 00:19:19.108
SAM: I could have used my Deflect Missiles! I'll
do that next time!

00:19:19.108 --> 00:19:23.029
TRAVIS: You need to be on your game! Come on!

00:19:23.029 --> 00:19:27.221
MATT: All right! So as you guys are rushing
forward now, the crowd swarming up behind you, you

00:19:27.221 --> 00:19:34.335
glance over to the right and you can see pouring
out of the back side of this tower, three very

00:19:34.335 --> 00:19:40.539
brutish-looking uruk with bulging muscles. They
have dark helmets on and this faint glow in their

00:19:40.539 --> 00:19:46.677
eyes as they charge in and start cleaving into
nearby allies of yours that were drinking not a

00:19:46.677 --> 00:19:47.850
moment ago.

00:19:47.850 --> 00:19:50.588
TRAVIS: Am I far enough away to pick one off with
my crossbow?

00:19:50.588 --> 00:19:51.934
MATT: Go for it! Make an attack.

00:19:51.934 --> 00:19:53.968
TRAVIS: Okay! Crossbow, 1d8.

00:19:53.968 --> 00:19:57.380
LAURA: I know what those are! This is cool, Matt!

00:19:57.380 --> 00:20:01.080
TRAVIS: Oh, that's good! That is 11.

00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:02.589
MATT: 11.

00:20:02.589 --> 00:20:07.666
TRAVIS: No, no, no! 16.

00:20:07.666 --> 00:20:10.402
LAURA: That's not close at all!

00:20:10.402 --> 00:20:12.230
TRAVIS: I know, it's way off.

00:20:12.230 --> 00:20:13.501
MATT: I'll consider that in character.

00:20:13.501 --> 00:20:14.729
TRAVIS: Thank you.

00:20:14.729 --> 00:20:16.061
MATT: That hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

00:20:16.061 --> 00:20:23.858
TRAVIS: Yes! d8. That's a 15.

00:20:23.858 --> 00:20:25.549
MATT: 15 damage?

00:20:25.549 --> 00:20:31.569
TRAVIS: Well, 1d8 plus four. So nope, that's
wrong. That's a six. Six damage.

00:20:31.569 --> 00:20:36.101
MATT: It is currently in a scuffle with somebody,
so I'll let you get sneak attack damage if you

00:20:36.101 --> 00:20:37.271
want to.

00:20:37.271 --> 00:20:39.529
LAURA: Whoa, you're a roguey rogue!

00:20:39.529 --> 00:20:40.468
TRAVIS: 3d6?

00:20:40.468 --> 00:20:41.468
MATT: 3d6, yeah.

00:20:41.468 --> 00:20:42.890
TRAVIS: Holy smokes!

00:20:42.890 --> 00:20:44.091
LAURA: He gets 3d6?

00:20:44.091 --> 00:20:47.778
TRAVIS: Five, six, ten. 11 total. Sneak attack.

00:20:47.778 --> 00:20:53.521
MATT: All right, so on top of the six, 17. So you
watch as this one orc grunt, rushing forward,

00:20:53.521 --> 00:20:57.822
takes its battleaxe and jams it right into the
clavicle of one of the nearby Uruk. Its weapon

00:20:57.822 --> 00:21:02.711
falls out of its hand. As it looks up, towards
you, with a flash in its eyes, (gurgle), the bolt

00:21:02.711 --> 00:21:07.240
goes straight into its throat. (gurgle) It begins
to bleed out its black dark ichor, before it falls

00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:08.798
to the ground, not moving.

00:21:08.798 --> 00:21:09.998
TRAVIS: Got one!

00:21:09.998 --> 00:21:13.815
LAURA: Nice going, Skak! I run forward and try to
do the same thing to another one.

00:21:13.815 --> 00:21:18.768
MATT: Okay. I will actually ask you three, since
he got the jump on him, two other existing ones

00:21:18.768 --> 00:21:20.760
are now charging towards you, to roll initiative
real fast.

00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:23.669
SAM: 21.

00:21:23.669 --> 00:21:26.089
LAURA: Oh shit. 18.

00:21:26.089 --> 00:21:30.339
DARIN: What do I add to my roll? 12.

00:21:30.339 --> 00:21:35.535
MATT: All righty. So we have Ur-Eden, we have
Arby.

00:21:35.535 --> 00:21:38.086
SAM: You can call me Eden.

00:21:38.086 --> 00:21:40.940
DARIN: You can call me Mozuu the Chosen.

00:21:40.940 --> 00:21:42.239
MATT: There we go.

00:21:42.239 --> 00:21:44.375
TRAVIS: There's only two things you need to call me.

00:21:44.375 --> 00:21:51.358
DARIN: Mozuu the Chosen, and that's it. Will this
be a theme? Yes it will.

00:21:51.358 --> 00:21:56.387
MATT: So Ur-Eden, you're up first. There are two
of these grunts that are rushing forward, both

00:21:56.387 --> 00:22:00.800
dual-handing battleaxes, and they're charging in.
(guttural shout)

00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:05.034
SAM: All right, I'll pick up my quarterstaff with
two hands, and I will hit one of them.

00:22:05.034 --> 00:22:06.368
MATT: Go for it!

00:22:06.368 --> 00:22:12.506
SAM: (laughs) The one on the left. Hiyah! Ooh, not
good. 11!

00:22:12.506 --> 00:22:18.219
MATT: 11. Nope! You swing, and it ducks low, and
it's going to come up with an upward strike. Do

00:22:18.219 --> 00:22:19.460
you have another attack?

00:22:19.460 --> 00:22:20.598
SAM: I have a second attack.

00:22:20.598 --> 00:22:21.960
MATT: All right, attack again.

00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:24.350
SAM: Ooh, this one is better! 26!

00:22:24.350 --> 00:22:26.197
MATT: That hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

00:22:26.197 --> 00:22:36.380
SAM: All right. 1d8 plus four. I don't know how to
do this. Okay, that's eight points of damage. But!

00:22:36.380 --> 00:22:43.817
Let's do other things, too. I'm going to use my
Stunning Strike, right?

00:22:43.817 --> 00:22:45.811
MATT: All right, so you spend a ki point to stun
him.

00:22:45.811 --> 00:22:50.805
SAM: I'm going to use a ki point. Yes. 14.

00:22:50.805 --> 00:22:56.891
MATT: 14, no, he gets an 11. So he is stunned.
Describe the Stunning Strike for me.

00:22:56.891 --> 00:23:02.277
SAM: Okay. The Stunning Strike. So when I hit him,
I, knowing my medical knowledge that I have so

00:23:02.277 --> 00:23:07.421
well, I aim for the one place that I know hurts
the most: the wang.

00:23:07.421 --> 00:23:11.992
DARIN: Would you like to act it out?

00:23:11.992 --> 00:23:13.291
SAM: On you.

00:23:13.291 --> 00:23:14.957
DARIN: Oh no, wait! I'm wearing a suit.

00:23:14.957 --> 00:23:18.980
SAM: So I jab him right between the legs.

00:23:18.980 --> 00:23:20.651
MATT: What's the uruk term for that, by the way?

00:23:20.651 --> 00:23:22.184
SAM: Oh, right in the gronk.

00:23:22.184 --> 00:23:23.455
MATT: There we go.

00:23:23.455 --> 00:23:29.881
SAM: Right in the gronk. Sharply hit. Nice and
low. Gronk hit!

00:23:29.881 --> 00:23:34.907
MATT: It barely manages to maintain grip on the
battleaxe, but right now is doubled over, knees

00:23:34.907 --> 00:23:39.987
knocked inward, in a bad place. Currently not able
to sustain any sort of combat motive.

00:23:39.987 --> 00:23:42.334
SAM: Take that, you glob!

00:23:42.334 --> 00:23:47.450
MATT: (groans) There's no words. That ends your
turn?

00:23:47.450 --> 00:23:51.192
SAM: I believe so. Oh, wait, a bonus. I don't know
how this guy works.

00:23:51.192 --> 00:23:53.092
LAURA: Does he stay stunned for a turn?

00:23:53.092 --> 00:23:55.856
MATT: You get a free bonus action strike if you
want to, with your fist.

00:23:55.856 --> 00:23:58.177
SAM: Bonus action strike?

00:23:58.177 --> 00:23:59.244
MATT: Yeah.

00:23:59.244 --> 00:24:00.184
SAM: You can do that?

00:24:00.184 --> 00:24:01.014
MATT: Yeah.

00:24:01.014 --> 00:24:06.732
SAM: All right, great. I will. If I hit a stunned
person, does he become unstunned? No.

00:24:06.732 --> 00:24:10.462
MATT: Sorry, that's the Flurry of Blows with your
Ki point, if you wanted to spend another one.

00:24:10.462 --> 00:24:12.004
SAM: Oh, no, I'm good. I'm done.

00:24:12.004 --> 00:24:14.758
LAURA: But if you hit a guy that's stunned, does
he become unstunned?

00:24:14.758 --> 00:24:17.654
MATT: No. But attacks against him have advantage.

00:24:17.654 --> 00:24:19.113
LAURA: Tight.

00:24:19.113 --> 00:24:21.593
MATT: All right. So next up is Arby. Arby, what are
you going to do?

00:24:21.593 --> 00:24:26.754
LAURA: I'm going to run up and hit the guy that he
hit between the legs with my maul.

00:24:26.754 --> 00:24:28.344
MATT: So as he's like (groans).

00:24:28.344 --> 00:24:30.003
LAURA: I hit him like a batter.

00:24:30.003 --> 00:24:34.763
MATT: The eyes glance up to meet yours, just as you go
for the giant golf swing.

00:24:34.763 --> 00:24:37.842
LAURA: That's a 15 to hit.

00:24:37.842 --> 00:24:39.579
MATT: You have advantage on this strike, don't
forget.

00:24:39.579 --> 00:24:40.667
LAURA: Because he's stunned.

00:24:40.667 --> 00:24:41.807
MATT: Yep.

00:24:41.807 --> 00:24:46.724
LAURA: That's a 19 to hit. No, that's wrong, that
was a 17 to hit.

00:24:46.724 --> 00:24:48.534
MATT: (laughs) That's okay.

00:24:48.534 --> 00:24:49.714
LAURA: Does it still hit?

00:24:49.714 --> 00:24:50.690
MATT: Yes.

00:24:50.690 --> 00:24:55.449
LAURA: Yeah! Okay, let's see.

00:24:55.449 --> 00:25:00.444
MATT: Actually, sorry, with the staff, you still
can do a bonus action strike if you want to.

00:25:00.444 --> 00:25:03.193
SAM: Oh. That's crazy! I already took two hits.

00:25:03.193 --> 00:25:07.859
MATT: Two hits, and bonus action you can get a
third. Or spend a Ki point and get a fourth as well.

00:25:07.859 --> 00:25:13.928
SAM: Can I jab at the guy next to me? All right,
sorry, Laura, I'm interfering.

00:25:13.928 --> 00:25:15.129
MATT: Damage?

00:25:15.129 --> 00:25:16.566
LAURA: 12 on the first hit.

00:25:16.566 --> 00:25:22.967
MATT: The guy who's stunned, you knock him a good
15 feet in the air with an arc. (shout) His

00:25:22.967 --> 00:25:27.596
crumpled body lands on the large wooden spikes of
the wall that you see some of the archers are on above

00:25:27.596 --> 00:25:29.939
and is stuck on there, impaled.

00:25:29.939 --> 00:25:34.165
LAURA: That was artistic. Is there another guy?

00:25:34.165 --> 00:25:36.114
SAM: Are you the scar artist?

00:25:36.114 --> 00:25:39.311
TRAVIS: No, that's me! I'm the Scar-Artist!

00:25:39.311 --> 00:25:41.095
LAURA: Do you have something else you have to do?

00:25:41.095 --> 00:25:42.586
SAM: I was just jabbing the other guy.

00:25:42.586 --> 00:25:43.954
MATT: What did you roll for that?

00:25:43.954 --> 00:25:45.814
SAM: I rolled a 23.

00:25:45.814 --> 00:25:47.390
MATT: That hits, go ahead and roll damage.

00:25:47.390 --> 00:25:50.425
SAM: Another eight points.

00:25:50.425 --> 00:25:52.597
MATT: All right. And then you.

00:25:52.597 --> 00:25:54.132
LAURA: And there's another guy I can hit?

00:25:54.132 --> 00:25:56.142
MATT: Same guy that he's attacking, so there's two
more that weren't destroyed.

00:25:56.142 --> 00:26:00.048
LAURA: Oh no. That might not. 11.

00:26:00.048 --> 00:26:05.256
MATT: Unfortunately, from hitting the first guy,
it's already telegraphed your next swing against the

00:26:05.256 --> 00:26:07.934
other. He sidesteps it, passes by.

00:26:07.934 --> 00:26:10.885
LAURA: It's because I wasn't looking at him. I was
looking at the beauty on the spike over there.

00:26:10.885 --> 00:26:16.818
MATT: Indeed. He's going to rush up to you with
his battleaxe and make a strike towards you, who

00:26:16.818 --> 00:26:19.918
destroyed his friend. That's going to be an 18.

00:26:19.918 --> 00:26:23.118
LAURA: That is my armor class.

00:26:23.118 --> 00:26:29.778
MATT: So it manages to hit you. You suffer 11
points of slashing damage.

00:26:29.778 --> 00:26:33.366
LAURA: Oh no! I'm going to use my reaction to
reduce the damage.

00:26:33.366 --> 00:26:36.087
MATT: You're using your Troll's Endurance?

00:26:36.087 --> 00:26:37.997
LAURA: Yeah, but can I only do that once?

00:26:37.997 --> 00:26:39.407
MATT: Once per short rest.

00:26:39.407 --> 00:26:40.576
LAURA: Oh, really?

00:26:40.576 --> 00:26:41.507
MATT: Yeah.

00:26:41.507 --> 00:26:43.017
TRAVIS: You better pick the time you want to use
it.

00:26:43.017 --> 00:26:44.189
LAURA: Okay, I'm not going to do that just yet.

00:26:44.189 --> 00:26:48.680
MATT: Okay, you take 11 points of slashing damage as the
battleaxe comes down, slamming between two plates

00:26:48.723 --> 00:26:57.425
of armor and embedding itself somewhere in your
torso. Mozuu, your turn.

00:26:57.425 --> 00:27:00.139
DARIN: There's one or two left?

00:27:00.139 --> 00:27:02.158
MATT: There's one left, who's been partially
wounded.

00:27:02.158 --> 00:27:08.898
DARIN: I think I'd like to use Bane and hold him.
That will stop him in his tracks, will it?

00:27:08.898 --> 00:27:11.059
MATT and DARIN: It may.

00:27:11.059 --> 00:27:12.766
SAM: Such a thinker, this one.

00:27:12.766 --> 00:27:19.108
DARIN: Because I shouted to him in a very powerful
way. I speak for Sauron.

00:27:19.108 --> 00:27:22.279
MATT: What's the spell DC?

00:27:22.279 --> 00:27:25.298
DARIN: The spell DC: 11.

00:27:25.298 --> 00:27:33.123
MATT: Okay, no. Nine minus one, so that's an
eight. You can have up to three creatures of your

00:27:33.123 --> 00:27:37.340
choice, if you want to. The range is 30 feet,
though, so it's pretty close. He's the only one

00:27:37.340 --> 00:27:42.662
you can see. As you stare at him, he looks fearful
for a moment and you can see the hand shaking.

00:27:42.662 --> 00:27:49.662
What's going to happen is you get to subtract 1d4 from
any of his rolls.

00:27:49.662 --> 00:27:54.633
LAURA: I am going to use Troll's Endurance because
if it's once per short rest, then it's okay, right?

00:27:54.633 --> 00:27:56.142
MATT: Sure!

00:27:56.142 --> 00:27:57.776
LAURA: Yeah! I'm going to do it.

00:27:57.776 --> 00:28:00.198
MATT: So roll your d12.

00:28:00.198 --> 00:28:05.919
LAURA: Ooh! Eight plus two, so I only take one
point of damage!

00:28:05.919 --> 00:28:10.422
MATT: One point of slashing damage. You shrug it
off. It goes through the plates of the armor, hits

00:28:10.422 --> 00:28:14.542
the skin and gets a minute in there, and you flex
your abs. They're so strong!

00:28:14.542 --> 00:28:16.502
LAURA: They're so strong!

00:28:16.502 --> 00:28:18.312
TRAVIS: Nice, Arby!

00:28:18.312 --> 00:28:22.382
LAURA: Thanks! That's why I'm Unbreakable; this is
why!

00:28:22.382 --> 00:28:24.473
MATT: Does that end your turn?

00:28:24.473 --> 00:28:25.383
DARIN: Yes.

00:28:25.383 --> 00:28:29.433
MATT: With that, another volley of crossbow bolts
and arrows comes flying over. You can see maybe a

00:28:29.433 --> 00:28:35.651
dozen flying from the wall. Other Uruk are
climbing to try and head these guys off in the

00:28:35.651 --> 00:28:39.331
distance. I need you all to make another dexterity
saving throw.

00:28:39.331 --> 00:28:44.535
SAM: 21!

00:28:44.535 --> 00:28:47.687
LAURA: Six!

00:28:47.687 --> 00:28:49.064
TRAVIS: 22.

00:28:49.064 --> 00:28:53.024
MATT: Both of you guys manage to dodge out of the
way. However, both of you take five points of

00:28:53.024 --> 00:28:57.145
piercing damage as a bolt or arrow hits each of
you in the shoulder or back.

00:28:57.145 --> 00:29:01.244
LAURA: Mine hit the back; yours hit the shoulder.

00:29:01.244 --> 00:29:02.575
DARIN: Thanks.

00:29:02.575 --> 00:29:03.686
LAURA: Yeah.

00:29:03.686 --> 00:29:05.312
DARIN: There's two things you have to know about
where that arrow hit.

00:29:05.312 --> 00:29:13.036
MATT: You guys are now at the base of the tower.
You hear a smaller explosion, muffled. More

00:29:13.036 --> 00:29:17.735
smoke's billowing out the side. It's a rather
large chamber that he lives in and it looks like

00:29:17.735 --> 00:29:23.885
about half of it is engulfed in flames, the side
nearest to the entrance. You guys rush up the

00:29:23.885 --> 00:29:27.404
stairs to head up the side of the tower? Or do you
find another way around?

00:29:27.404 --> 00:29:30.372
SAM: Are there any other ways around? Are there
ladders?

00:29:30.372 --> 00:29:34.445
DARIN: Did we defeat the one that we held?

00:29:34.445 --> 00:29:38.508
MATT: No, it's still standing there. What are you
going to do; are you going to fight that guy or

00:29:38.508 --> 00:29:39.678
keep moving?

00:29:39.678 --> 00:29:41.486
LAURA: Let's fuck that guy up.

00:29:41.486 --> 00:29:42.895
MATT: Then Eden, you're up first.

00:29:42.895 --> 00:29:49.679
SAM: Oh. We're going to beat this guy? I'm
ignoring this guy; I'm going to charge into the

00:29:49.679 --> 00:29:51.204
stairwell.

00:29:51.204 --> 00:29:53.443
TRAVIS: Go up the tower! Go!

00:29:53.443 --> 00:29:58.319
MATT: Attack of opportunity against you. That is a
15. What's your armor class?

00:29:58.319 --> 00:30:00.505
SAM: Does he have to roll a negative four?

00:30:00.505 --> 00:30:04.049
MATT: He has to minus d4 from him. So go ahead and
roll a d4.

00:30:04.049 --> 00:30:09.485
DARIN: That is a three.

00:30:09.485 --> 00:30:10.904
MATT: That's a 12.

00:30:10.904 --> 00:30:12.362
SAM: He does not hit me.

00:30:12.362 --> 00:30:17.685
MATT: The axe swings wide and you start darting up
the steps. Up next would be Arby.

00:30:17.685 --> 00:30:18.889
LAURA: I'm going to try to hit him.

00:30:18.889 --> 00:30:19.905
MATT: Go for it.

00:30:19.905 --> 00:30:25.348
TRAVIS: What about me? I thought I was at the top
of the round, right?

00:30:25.348 --> 00:30:26.729
MATT: Oh, that's right!

00:30:26.729 --> 00:30:30.054
TRAVIS: You know, because I went first with the
sneak attack.

00:30:30.144 --> 00:30:34.394
DARIN: It was your height, we overlooked you
because you're the smallest of the group

00:30:34.394 --> 00:30:38.753
apparently. You're a wee thing.

00:30:38.753 --> 00:30:42.554
TRAVIS: Can I run up and draw my shortsword, two
hands, and try and stick it in?

00:30:42.554 --> 00:30:46.472
MATT: Yeah you can, actually. So you toss the
crossbow over your shoulder, rush in blade out.

00:30:46.472 --> 00:30:50.946
Make an attack. With advantage, because he is
currently--

00:30:50.946 --> 00:30:52.524
TRAVIS: 19.

00:30:52.524 --> 00:30:55.072
MATT: All right, roll damage on that with sneak
attack.

00:30:55.072 --> 00:30:56.524
TRAVIS: Shortsword, 1d6.

00:30:56.524 --> 00:30:58.759
LAURA: And I'm standing next to him.

00:30:58.759 --> 00:31:03.013
TRAVIS: Sneak attack, five, six, ten--

00:31:03.013 --> 00:31:04.275
SAM: Sneak attack?

00:31:04.275 --> 00:31:09.904
TRAVIS: Yeah. Because somebody's within melee. 12
points of damage to his gut!

00:31:09.904 --> 00:31:18.268
MATT: With that, as he's currently standing there
swinging wide, missing Eden as he rushes past, he

00:31:18.268 --> 00:31:23.841
begins to give chase. At that point his body
stiffens up as the blade sinks right into the back

00:31:23.904 --> 00:31:27.471
of the spine. You drag it down through the
shoulder blades, and as it brings his arms forward

00:31:27.471 --> 00:31:30.982
it kind of opens the wound. He crumples to the
ground, not moving.

00:31:31.016 --> 00:31:33.921
TRAVIS: A beautiful scar to add to my collection.

00:31:33.921 --> 00:31:36.781
DARIN: How many does this make?

00:31:36.781 --> 00:31:40.321
TRAVIS: It makes 30.

00:31:40.321 --> 00:31:42.139
DARIN: Excellent.

00:31:42.139 --> 00:31:46.423
(laughter)

00:31:46.423 --> 00:31:48.537
SAM: Come on, you shugs, come with me up the
stairs!

00:31:48.537 --> 00:31:51.492
DARIN: Wait a minute, who's the leader of this
group?

00:31:51.492 --> 00:31:52.762
TRAVIS: You are.

00:31:52.762 --> 00:31:54.302
LAURA: Barfta.

00:31:54.302 --> 00:31:56.033
DARIN: Of this group, of us four!

00:31:56.033 --> 00:31:58.500
LAURA: Well, I was thinking I could lead?

00:31:58.500 --> 00:32:01.222
TRAVIS: As a collective? Do we vote? Is it
democracy?

00:32:01.222 --> 00:32:05.772
DARIN: This is a democracy in which I lead. Let's
go up the stairs, as he said.

00:32:05.772 --> 00:32:06.988
TRAVIS: Okay.

00:32:06.988 --> 00:32:07.892
DARIN: Good.

00:32:07.892 --> 00:32:10.658
MATT: All right, the rest of you catch up. You're
faster than the rest, so you dart up towards the

00:32:10.658 --> 00:32:15.885
top of the stairs. Partway up the stairway, as you
rush around the corner, you see an even more

00:32:15.885 --> 00:32:23.723
muscular orc standing there right before you. No
helmet on, fury and this faint gray glow to the

00:32:23.723 --> 00:32:32.453
eyes. Swinging wide with a giant, two-handed
hammer, goes swinging towards you. And gets two

00:32:32.453 --> 00:32:38.562
attacks, but the first one, a natural two, misses
the first one. And a natural one for the second

00:32:38.562 --> 00:32:44.178
one. Swings wide once, and then swings a second
time and you put your foot out and trip him, and

00:32:44.178 --> 00:32:47.867
as you do he stumbles forward and the hammer
actually slams into the side of the tower. It

00:32:47.867 --> 00:32:52.802
wedges itself into the stonework as it's cracked
and broken inward. And is currently trying to pull

00:32:52.802 --> 00:32:54.453
its weapon out of the stonework.

00:32:54.453 --> 00:33:01.033
SAM: Oh, that looks like a problem. I will solve
it! I will attack him with my quarterstaff. Ten

00:33:01.033 --> 00:33:02.995
plus seven, ooh, 17.

00:33:02.995 --> 00:33:05.112
MATT: 17 hits, go ahead and roll damage.

00:33:05.112 --> 00:33:12.608
SAM: Yes! So that hit goes for, ooh, 12 points,
and you said he looked stronger than the rest?

00:33:12.608 --> 00:33:13.573
MATT: Yes.

00:33:13.573 --> 00:33:16.566
SAM: I will use my Flurry of Blows.

00:33:16.566 --> 00:33:18.283
MATT: Okay, so you get three more attacks on him.

00:33:18.283 --> 00:33:29.556
SAM: I would like to flurry! 19 plus seven!

00:33:29.556 --> 00:33:31.685
MATT: That hits, roll damage on that.

00:33:31.685 --> 00:33:38.432
SAM: That's another nine points of damage. 20,
natural 20!

00:33:38.432 --> 00:33:41.042
DARIN: Well flurried, friend!

00:33:41.042 --> 00:33:43.642
MATT: Go ahead and roll your dice, double it.

00:33:43.642 --> 00:33:44.884
SAM: One.

00:33:44.884 --> 00:33:47.254
MATT: So two?

00:33:47.254 --> 00:33:55.133
SAM: That's two plus four. So that's six. And then
one more. Six plus seven is only a 13.

00:33:55.133 --> 00:33:59.494
MATT: 13 just barely hits, doesn't have a lot of
armor on him.

00:33:59.494 --> 00:34:02.372
SAM: Eight plus four, another 12 points of
damage!

00:34:02.372 --> 00:34:09.701
MATT: So how do you want to do this? You finish
this guy off. With these four strikes, as he's

00:34:09.701 --> 00:34:12.723
currently trying to wrestle his weapon from the
side of the tower, how do you finish him?

00:34:12.723 --> 00:34:14.164
SAM: Like Zorro.

00:34:14.164 --> 00:34:15.513
DARIN: Who?

00:34:15.513 --> 00:34:17.693
LAURA: Who's that?

00:34:17.693 --> 00:34:26.263
SAM: He was this glob that I killed two towns
over. He would always write a Z on his victims.

00:34:26.263 --> 00:34:36.395
But my name is Eden? So I'm going to try and write
an E. (grunts)

00:34:36.395 --> 00:34:43.214
MATT: With an exposed muscular torso, it takes a
lot of pressure to try and cut someone with a

00:34:43.214 --> 00:34:49.026
quarterstaff. However, you thankfully as an
olog-hai are a very strong creature by nature, and

00:34:49.026 --> 00:34:56.377
in a horrible display, you break the skin and
force an E across his body with your

00:34:56.377 --> 00:34:57.434
quarterstaff.

00:34:57.434 --> 00:34:59.113
SAM: Can I make a lowercase E?

00:34:59.113 --> 00:35:08.634
MATT: Sure! With that, he looks down at the E and
you just push him off the edge of the stairs and

00:35:08.634 --> 00:35:12.084
he tumbles. You hear this lower-pitched Wilhelm
scream.

00:35:12.084 --> 00:35:15.180
SAM: (roaring)

00:35:15.180 --> 00:35:20.161
DARIN: Ur-Eden, keep him alive! We need to
question him!

00:35:20.161 --> 00:35:23.364
SAM: He committed suicide.

00:35:23.364 --> 00:35:26.914
DARIN: As they all do when they see your might.

00:35:26.914 --> 00:35:28.975
SAM: He said he was so scared of you, Mozuu!

00:35:28.975 --> 00:35:37.682
DARIN: Oh, yeah, there's two things people do when
they're scared of me. Commit suicide, and that's it!

00:35:37.682 --> 00:35:43.065
MATT: At which point you guys have now caught up
to the back of Ur-Eden, and you guys climb up the

00:35:43.065 --> 00:35:46.756
rest of the stairs. You can now look over the side
of the walls, and you can see a number of the

00:35:46.756 --> 00:35:53.770
uruk within this fortress have now overtaken a lot
of the marauding, arriving traitors that had begun

00:35:53.770 --> 00:35:58.594
to attack. And it seems like most of the
uprising's being quelled, however no one has

00:35:58.594 --> 00:36:00.150
gotten to the tower as quick as you.

00:36:00.150 --> 00:36:07.185
SAM: Do the uprisers, the rebels, look different?
Do they have anything different about them in

00:36:07.185 --> 00:36:08.405
their eyes?

00:36:08.405 --> 00:36:15.264
MATT: Other than the occasional flash in the eyes,
nothing else seems to catch your attention.

00:36:15.264 --> 00:36:19.785
However, as you get to the top of the stairs
around this tower, you're looking at the entrance.

00:36:19.785 --> 00:36:24.576
The door's partially broken inward and flames
have completely wreathed the entrance to this

00:36:24.605 --> 00:36:30.258
chamber. It's really hot and you immediately
recoil at the blaze before you. How do you wish to

00:36:30.258 --> 00:36:31.334
proceed?

00:36:31.334 --> 00:36:33.026
LAURA: Is Barfta in there?

00:36:33.026 --> 00:36:35.329
SAM: That's where he slumbers.

00:36:35.329 --> 00:36:36.890
LAURA: And it's on fire?

00:36:36.890 --> 00:36:38.866
SAM: We should probably go in.

00:36:38.866 --> 00:36:41.176
DARIN: If we rescue him, we're heroes.

00:36:41.176 --> 00:36:44.974
MATT: You hear a (muffled yelling) from behind the
wall on the inside.

00:36:44.974 --> 00:36:47.606
LAURA: Barfta, is that you?

00:36:47.606 --> 00:36:55.035
DARIN: Yes, tell us if it's you. If it's you say,
"This is Barfta, I'm on fire!" If you're not on

00:36:55.035 --> 00:36:58.425
fire, say-- You know, just say whatever you like.

00:36:58.425 --> 00:37:02.645
MATT: There's a brief pause before you hear again
(muffled yelling).

00:37:02.645 --> 00:37:05.065
LAURA: I don't know if that was Barfta.

00:37:05.065 --> 00:37:08.998
DARIN: That was not following my directions.
Therefore, I do not know if we should enter--

00:37:08.998 --> 00:37:11.376
LAURA: Maybe we should break the door down to see
who it is?

00:37:11.376 --> 00:37:12.484
DARIN: Break it down.

00:37:12.484 --> 00:37:13.930
LAURA: I try to break it down.

00:37:13.930 --> 00:37:16.065
MATT: All right, make an attack.

00:37:16.065 --> 00:37:18.635
LAURA: 17 plus eight!

00:37:18.635 --> 00:37:24.646
MATT: Okay, go ahead and roll damage! With your
giant maul, you slam down with this gargantuan

00:37:24.646 --> 00:37:26.286
hammer into the burning wood.

00:37:26.286 --> 00:37:31.449
LAURA: I get to reroll ones! Ten plus five, 15!

00:37:31.449 --> 00:37:37.477
MATT: 15 points of damage, crack! Most of the door
breaks down. It's still barely holding on to the

00:37:37.477 --> 00:37:41.547
bottom hinge, but it now gives you a full view of
the inside. You do suffer four points of fire

00:37:41.547 --> 00:37:46.117
damage due to the proximity to the flame, however
you have opened an entryway to the chamber.

00:37:46.117 --> 00:37:52.825
Looking inside, you can see flames have taken the
entire western side of the chamber. You can see a

00:37:52.825 --> 00:37:57.416
lot of the silks that he keeps-- For the point
here, as the leader of this portion of the

00:37:57.416 --> 00:38:02.331
marauder tribe, Barfta likes nice things. Even
glancing inside you've gotten little glimpses of

00:38:02.331 --> 00:38:09.687
the inside of his chamber here and there, and you
can see gold spoils adorning taken cabinets and

00:38:09.687 --> 00:38:16.728
boxes and crates left around. There's just a large
pile of somewhat loosely comfortable materials

00:38:16.728 --> 00:38:20.854
that you scoff at the idea of such comfort, but
silently in the back of your head, you're like, I

00:38:20.854 --> 00:38:22.057
bet that's nice.

00:38:22.057 --> 00:38:23.767
LAURA: Can we see where Barfta is in here?

00:38:23.767 --> 00:38:29.264
MATT: You do actually see the far wall is an open
hole, destroyed by one of the earlier detonations.

00:38:29.264 --> 00:38:34.667
You can see the entry point was the other side of
this tower. You see numerous ruined bodies of

00:38:34.667 --> 00:38:40.907
uruk, like the one that you saw guarding the
stairway on the way up, are now littering the

00:38:40.907 --> 00:38:45.677
floor, near that opening in the window. And there
in the center you see Warchief Barfta, muscles

00:38:45.677 --> 00:38:51.776
swollen in rage. He kneels amidst these bodies,
repeatedly slamming his fist into the face of a

00:38:51.776 --> 00:38:58.948
still-living would-be assassin, who's now on the
ground just being clutched by the throat (roars).

00:38:58.948 --> 00:39:02.458
He's just like gone feral in his face at this
point.

00:39:02.458 --> 00:39:05.650
LAURA: Does he look like he's in trouble? Does he
look hurt?

00:39:05.650 --> 00:39:07.000
TRAVIS: Injured? On fire?

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:08.657
MATT: Make a perception check.

00:39:08.657 --> 00:39:14.408
LAURA: I'm very perceptive. 15.

00:39:14.408 --> 00:39:19.019
MATT: Glancing in, you can see he looks wounded on
one arm, one arm looks like it has a few gashes,

00:39:19.019 --> 00:39:24.397
but for the most part seems to be not too worse
for wear. As soon as the door bashes in, he's like

00:39:24.397 --> 00:39:28.584
growling at this one uruk on the ground who's
partially broken with one eye swollen shut.

00:39:28.584 --> 00:39:33.158
Glances over, looks in your direction,
"What're you doing? Get in and help!"

00:39:33.158 --> 00:39:38.950
LAURA: Okay, I try to break through the rest of
the door.

00:39:38.950 --> 00:39:43.732
MATT: Okay, so make an athletics check. Since
you've already ruined most of its structure, this

00:39:43.732 --> 00:39:46.160
is more of a just pushing the rest of it out of
the way.

00:39:46.160 --> 00:39:50.180
LAURA: Oh, no. Oh, I have really good athletics!
12.

00:39:50.180 --> 00:39:52.722
TRAVIS: It's nice, isn't it?

00:39:52.722 --> 00:39:55.309
LAURA: Yeah, oh my god! I'm so strong!

00:39:55.309 --> 00:40:01.100
MATT: You manage to take the rest of your hammer
and smash through the remains of the door. You do

00:40:01.100 --> 00:40:05.270
suffer another two points of fire damage in the
process, but you've cleared the entryway and no

00:40:05.270 --> 00:40:09.589
one else will suffer fire damage passing through
the entryway. You all step into the center of the

00:40:09.589 --> 00:40:13.741
chamber and there the warchief is still clutching
his assassin on the ground and he's grinning and

00:40:13.741 --> 00:40:22.680
going, "You stupid shrak, who sent you? What fool
dares raise arms against me?" The assassin

00:40:22.680 --> 00:40:31.191
(gurgles). Spits in his face. Looks back at the
rest of you with this look of rage in his eyes.

00:40:31.191 --> 00:40:38.691
The Warchief, "You there, make yourself useful and
get my information!" He throws the wounded

00:40:38.691 --> 00:40:45.390
assassin at your feet who tumbles. He
starts coughing and trying to get up.

00:40:45.390 --> 00:40:50.262
LAURA: Oh, I step on him, but not to kill him, to
hold him in place.

00:40:50.262 --> 00:40:57.251
MATT: A very big foot right on his chest, he's now
like pinned on the ground pushing against the

00:40:57.251 --> 00:41:03.142
foot, but not able to get any ground. He's looking
up at you, eyes wide from the pressure.

00:41:03.142 --> 00:41:05.400
(coughing)

00:41:05.400 --> 00:41:08.260
LAURA: Can you answer some questions for us,
please?

00:41:08.260 --> 00:41:09.989
TRAVIS: Why are you being so polite?

00:41:09.989 --> 00:41:15.346
LAURA: Oh, no. I scream in his face. Somebody ask
him questions.

00:41:15.404 --> 00:41:25.827
DARIN: I'll walk over, I'll get real close to him.
Hello friend, my name is Mozuu the Chosen. I've

00:41:25.827 --> 00:41:37.477
heard the voice of Sauron. He told me the strong
take what they want. You see all this around here?

00:41:37.477 --> 00:41:47.316
That could be part of yours if you're strong
enough. You tell us why, why you'd do this, and

00:41:47.316 --> 00:41:50.404
riches await you.

00:41:50.404 --> 00:41:51.697
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

00:41:51.697 --> 00:41:53.067
LAURA: Is that the truth?

00:41:53.067 --> 00:42:03.784
DARIN: Shush. Oh, I'm bad at dice. Miss. 15 plus--
Where is my thing?

00:42:03.784 --> 00:42:04.986
SAM: Persuasion, right?

00:42:04.986 --> 00:42:07.718
DARIN: Oh, 18.

00:42:07.718 --> 00:42:18.532
MATT: 18. He calms down for a minute and smiles at
you. You can see that same weird gray flash in his

00:42:18.532 --> 00:42:25.731
eyes. "You'll get nothing from me. Death comes for
you all."

00:42:25.731 --> 00:42:30.826
DARIN: Death comes for us all, friend, it just
depends on when. It doesn't have to come for you

00:42:30.826 --> 00:42:34.258
today. Riches can be yours.

00:42:34.258 --> 00:42:42.660
MATT: "Look, I was sent by Ur-Gram the
Face-Eater."

00:42:42.660 --> 00:42:45.463
SAM: Ur-Grandma?

00:42:45.463 --> 00:42:54.829
MATT: Ur-Gram the Face-Eater. "See, he survived
his duel in the wastes east of here under a new

00:42:54.829 --> 00:43:03.144
"lord. They have many under their banner. We was
sent to take this fort, we was, and succeed we

00:43:03.144 --> 00:43:14.467
"would have, and we will again soon. Nargroth is
next. Enjoy your heads while you still got them."

00:43:14.467 --> 00:43:22.237
LAURA: I start looking around the room and forget
that I'm actually standing on him and I put my

00:43:22.237 --> 00:43:24.011
full weight down.

00:43:24.011 --> 00:43:26.402
MATT: (gargled screaming)

00:43:26.402 --> 00:43:29.438
LAURA: Oh, does that hurt?

00:43:29.438 --> 00:43:34.742
DARIN: We thank you for your information. Arby,
eat his face.

00:43:34.742 --> 00:43:37.938
LAURA: I don't actually like the taste of--

00:43:37.938 --> 00:43:40.610
DARIN: Okay, that was a good moment and I was like
threatening him.

00:43:40.610 --> 00:43:42.614
LAURA: I'll just finish stepping on him.

00:43:42.614 --> 00:43:52.040
MATT: Heavy stomp. Just this watermelon splatter
of Uruk head against the stonework. The flames

00:43:52.040 --> 00:43:56.433
still burning around. The Warchief seems less
frustrated.

00:43:56.433 --> 00:44:00.362
DARIN: Your problem was solved, Warchief. We
interrogated.

00:44:00.362 --> 00:44:03.501
TRAVIS: I'm just carving little scars into the
dead body.

00:44:03.501 --> 00:44:12.359
MATT: The Warchief has now sat down on the ground,
back slumped against the pile of rags and cloth

00:44:12.359 --> 00:44:19.128
that he sleeps on and pulls a bottle of spoiled
wine and uncorks it. Begins to wash the open

00:44:19.128 --> 00:44:22.979
wounds on the arm, takes a swig.

00:44:22.979 --> 00:44:26.959
SAM: Oh, oh yes, do you need medical attention, my
lord?

00:44:26.959 --> 00:44:30.980
MATT: "Does it look like I need medical
attention?"

00:44:30.980 --> 00:44:33.764
SAM: Yes.

00:44:33.764 --> 00:44:35.798
MATT: "Then fix me!"

00:44:35.798 --> 00:44:50.650
SAM: All right, I grab my healer's kit and I will
use my really dirty bandages to wrap him up. I

00:44:50.650 --> 00:44:55.950
don't really have anything to fasten it with so I
hock a loogie on one and then fasten it to the

00:44:55.950 --> 00:44:58.097
other piece and hope that holds.

00:44:58.097 --> 00:45:01.340
MATT: Perfect, okay, roll your healing.

00:45:01.340 --> 00:45:07.276
SAM: Oh yes, 1d6 plus nine. 12 points.

00:45:07.276 --> 00:45:16.240
MATT: All right. So as you bend, take them, and:
"Yeah." He was like, (grunts, then breathes).

00:45:16.240 --> 00:45:27.245
"Ur-Gram leaves and wants to take my fort, does
he? Wants to wallow in my shadow, does he? That

00:45:27.245 --> 00:45:36.073
"sniveling orog's going to taste a &lt;i&gt;hundred blades&lt;/i&gt;
before he falls, I say. Am I right?"

00:45:36.073 --> 00:45:37.593
SAM and TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:45:37.593 --> 00:45:39.628
DARIN: Do you have a hundred blades?

00:45:39.628 --> 00:45:42.138
MATT: "I've got more than a hundred blades!"

00:45:42.138 --> 00:45:46.707
DARIN: How many exactly &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; we have? Do we ever
count? Is there someone in charge to count the

00:45:46.707 --> 00:45:47.673
blades?

00:45:47.673 --> 00:45:50.795
MATT: "Your job now is to count the blades."

00:45:50.795 --> 00:45:53.042
DARIN: We have two blades.

00:45:53.042 --> 00:45:54.834
LAURA: You are so good at-- oh, counting.

00:45:54.834 --> 00:46:01.242
DARIN: Yeah, I am very good at counting. That's
why they call me Mozuu the Chosen.

00:46:01.242 --> 00:46:02.460
MATT: "Mozuu?"

00:46:02.460 --> 00:46:03.590
DARIN: The Chosen.

00:46:03.590 --> 00:46:04.829
MATT: "And who chose you?"

00:46:04.829 --> 00:46:05.990
DARIN: Sauron.

00:46:05.990 --> 00:46:12.463
MATT: (laughs) "Stupid. What's your names, then?
Who's your commander?"

00:46:12.463 --> 00:46:15.884
SAM: We follow Barfta-- oh wait, that's you.

00:46:15.884 --> 00:46:21.141
MATT: "That's right. You follow &lt;i&gt;me&lt;/i&gt;!"

00:46:21.141 --> 00:46:22.442
SAM and LAURA: Yes.

00:46:22.442 --> 00:46:24.419
MATT: (shouting) "What's your name?"

00:46:24.419 --> 00:46:26.321
DARIN: Mozuu the Chosen.

00:46:26.321 --> 00:46:32.865
SAM: My name's Ur-Eden. Ur-Eden Goodthink. You
can call me Eden.

00:46:32.865 --> 00:46:41.561
LAURA: I'm Arb-Uruk, the Unbreakable. But you
can call me Arby.

00:46:41.561 --> 00:46:49.862
TRAVIS: Oh, powerful Barfta! I am lowly Skak the
Scar-Artist, to serve you.

00:46:49.862 --> 00:47:00.712
MATT: "All right. You seem to be an able-bodied
lot. You want to show your Warchief what &lt;i&gt;real&lt;/i&gt;

00:47:00.712 --> 00:47:03.204
"uruk are made of?"

00:47:03.204 --> 00:47:07.480
DARIN: Is this before or after I count the
blades?

00:47:07.480 --> 00:47:09.489
MATT: "After."

00:47:09.489 --> 00:47:10.591
DARIN: Good.

00:47:10.591 --> 00:47:16.392
MATT: "Yeah? Then go!" (gulps)

00:47:16.392 --> 00:47:17.932
LAURA: Where are we going again?

00:47:17.932 --> 00:47:29.912
MATT: "I'm getting there! Head east. Find where
Ur-Gram is hiding, tell me where and I'll reward

00:47:29.912 --> 00:47:38.952
"you. Bring me back his head, I'll shoot you all
straight to captains, with your own roots beneath you."

00:47:38.952 --> 00:47:41.342
TRAVIS: Captains!

00:47:41.342 --> 00:47:47.036
MATT: "Now hurry! Before the tracks go cold! Go!"

00:47:47.036 --> 00:47:52.682
DARIN: Again, you asked me to count blades, and
yet now--

00:47:52.682 --> 00:47:55.553
MATT: "Count them quickly! I don't care!"

00:47:55.553 --> 00:47:57.354
TRAVIS: It's a figure of speech, Mozuu.

00:47:57.354 --> 00:48:01.963
DARIN: I'll say there's more than a hundred. We're
going. We will bring you glory and we will bring

00:48:01.963 --> 00:48:03.331
you his head.

00:48:03.331 --> 00:48:09.481
MATT: "Good. Hundred swords. Heh."

00:48:09.481 --> 00:48:15.638
TRAVIS: Can I run across the room to the hole that
was blown in the other side of the room, check for

00:48:15.638 --> 00:48:18.854
clues or how they did it, or if there's any trace
of who came in?

00:48:18.854 --> 00:48:23.160
MATT: Make an investigation check in the vicinity,
and then a perception check looking through the hole.

00:48:23.160 --> 00:48:33.132
LAURA: While he's doing that, can I walk over to
Eden and say, I got burned a little in the door.

00:48:33.132 --> 00:48:37.753
SAM: All right. Do you need some healing, then?

00:48:37.753 --> 00:48:39.915
LAURA: Don't take my skin off, though.

00:48:39.915 --> 00:48:45.685
TRAVIS: 25 on the investigation, and an eight on
the perception.

00:48:45.685 --> 00:48:52.584
MATT: Okay! Looking through the hole that is
blasted into the side of this wall, there is a

00:48:52.584 --> 00:49:00.011
number of crumpled uruk, you see there are two
assassins on the ground, both with ruined forms,

00:49:00.011 --> 00:49:04.092
seemingly the explosion that they brought here
also blew them apart. The style you can

00:49:04.092 --> 00:49:16.256
appreciate. But you do see they have-- somehow through this
explosion, three small encased leather-bound orbs

00:49:16.256 --> 00:49:22.753
that survived the detonation. You take and sniff
it, it's a very familiar smell of powder.

00:49:22.753 --> 00:49:28.314
TRAVIS: Explodey powder? Can I pocket those
three?

00:49:28.314 --> 00:49:29.484
MATT: You do indeed. Yeah.

00:49:29.484 --> 00:49:30.749
LAURA: Oh, that's cool.

00:49:30.749 --> 00:49:32.334
MATT: What was your perception check?

00:49:32.334 --> 00:49:33.628
TRAVIS: It's an eight.

00:49:33.628 --> 00:49:39.775
MATT: An eight. You glance out past the hole, to
the dark hills in the distance. Nothing.

00:49:39.775 --> 00:49:47.089
TRAVIS: It's real blurry. Of you all, who has really good
like, you know, eyeballs?

00:49:47.166 --> 00:49:52.408
LAURA: I don't know if they're good or not, but I've
got some eyeballs.

00:49:52.497 --> 00:49:54.404
TRAVIS: Can you see anything out here?

00:49:54.404 --> 00:50:00.464
LAURA: I bring out my patch of eyeballs. Which kind
did you need, because I got little eyeballs and

00:50:00.464 --> 00:50:02.076
bigger eyeballs?

00:50:02.076 --> 00:50:04.079
TRAVIS: How long have you been holding those?

00:50:04.079 --> 00:50:06.375
SAM: Some of those aren't eyeballs, by the way.

00:50:06.375 --> 00:50:10.694
LAURA: Oh, that's a piece of lint, you're right.
What--

00:50:10.694 --> 00:50:14.435
(yelling and laughing)

00:50:14.435 --> 00:50:16.366
LAURA: The eagles! The eagles are coming!

00:50:16.366 --> 00:50:20.965
(laughing)

00:50:20.965 --> 00:50:22.036
MATT: That was amazing!

00:50:22.036 --> 00:50:24.274
TRAVIS: Are you Gandalf? Oh shit.

00:50:24.274 --> 00:50:25.793
DARIN: It's the magic of Mordor!

00:50:25.793 --> 00:50:27.496
SAM: I think we should follow you now!

00:50:27.496 --> 00:50:30.766
LAURA: I'm the chosen one! I'm the chosen!

00:50:30.766 --> 00:50:37.735
DARIN: That was Sauron made flesh!

00:50:37.735 --> 00:50:40.310
TRAVIS: Amazing.

00:50:40.310 --> 00:50:42.775
LAURA: Yeah, so...no?

00:50:42.775 --> 00:50:44.135
TRAVIS: Put those away.

00:50:44.135 --> 00:50:46.586
LAURA: Ow, but that made my hands hurt worse,
please.

00:50:46.586 --> 00:50:52.384
SAM: All right, I could heal you right now, or we
could use hit dice and take a short rest and that way

00:50:52.384 --> 00:50:56.088
I would save my ability to heal you later.

00:50:56.088 --> 00:50:59.259
LAURA: All right. Oh yeah, and then I get my
troll's endurance back!

00:50:59.259 --> 00:51:02.555
MATT: "So! Maggots!"

00:51:02.555 --> 00:51:04.336
SAM: Oh, you're still here!

00:51:04.336 --> 00:51:07.315
ALL: Sorry, sorry!

00:51:07.315 --> 00:51:13.265
SAM: If we're going to do this for you by the Dark
Lord's name, I feel that our group of four should

00:51:13.265 --> 00:51:16.436
have some sort of group name.

00:51:16.436 --> 00:51:18.456
TRAVIS: Ooh! Like a callsign!

00:51:18.456 --> 00:51:21.266
SAM: Yeah, a callsign or something. Is that
something you could hook us up with?

00:51:21.266 --> 00:51:23.526
MATT: "I mean..."

00:51:23.526 --> 00:51:26.127
LAURA: Do you have like fancy pins or something we
could wear?

00:51:26.127 --> 00:51:29.686
SAM: Or the Orc Four! The Orc Four! The Forcs!

00:51:29.686 --> 00:51:33.376
ALL: The Forcs! The Forcs!

00:51:33.376 --> 00:51:38.086
MATT: "No. All right, Forcs it is!"

00:51:38.086 --> 00:51:40.356
(cheering)

00:51:40.356 --> 00:51:44.057
MATT: "You! Are the Barfta Forcs!"

00:51:44.057 --> 00:51:48.757
SAM: Can we get little patches that say "Get
Forc-ed"?

00:51:48.757 --> 00:51:53.377
LAURA: Oh, you should, you should just carve it in
because you're a Scar-Artist!

00:51:53.377 --> 00:51:55.446
TRAVIS: Yeah, hold on, just one minute!

00:51:55.446 --> 00:52:00.251
DARIN: While you do that, I'm going to go count
some blades from this window.

00:52:00.251 --> 00:52:01.717
MATT: Okay, make a perception check.

00:52:01.717 --> 00:52:07.301
DARIN: Okay. 16.

00:52:07.301 --> 00:52:12.054
MATT: 16; glancing about over the next five or ten
minutes or so, you just count blades in the

00:52:12.054 --> 00:52:17.418
courtyard, and those that are pulling the
bodies of the gathered mutineers and executing

00:52:17.418 --> 00:52:23.216
them in the middle of the courtyard; you count
probably a good solid 73-74 blades by your

00:52:23.216 --> 00:52:28.727
estimation in immediate visual range. You throw in
some, you know, estimations of non-visual range

00:52:28.727 --> 00:52:34.207
based blades, the size of the fortress, probably
something around 125 blades currently available in

00:52:34.207 --> 00:52:37.627
just this small encampment outside the main
fortress.

00:52:37.627 --> 00:52:49.110
DARIN: By my count, we have 7,321 blades currently
available to us in this fort. We are unbeatable.

00:52:49.110 --> 00:52:54.703
We find this guy you want, this guy dies.

00:52:54.703 --> 00:52:57.547
MATT: "I like you."

00:52:57.547 --> 00:52:59.627
DARIN: Well thank you.

00:52:59.627 --> 00:53:00.798
MATT: "But get out."

00:53:00.798 --> 00:53:02.009
DARIN: Oh! Yeah, right.

00:53:02.009 --> 00:53:04.130
TRAVIS: Your shoulder is finished, where do you
want yours?

00:53:04.130 --> 00:53:05.507
LAURA: My shoulder looks really good.

00:53:05.507 --> 00:53:06.668
SAM: Across my back.

00:53:06.668 --> 00:53:11.513
MATT: As you're glancing out, you look past the
eastern mountainscape; you can see what are the

00:53:11.513 --> 00:53:18.675
Mithram Spur mountains to the east of this
encampment. The shadows of night have been

00:53:18.675 --> 00:53:24.728
claiming this vicinity as the sun's faded. You see
a handful of fleeing goblins, just vanishing into

00:53:24.728 --> 00:53:29.037
the mountains heading eastward and disappearing
into the shadows at the base.

00:53:29.037 --> 00:53:32.457
DARIN: Fleeing? Well, I couldn't probably tell,
the goblins--

00:53:32.457 --> 00:53:33.634
MATT: They're running away.

00:53:33.634 --> 00:53:35.658
DARIN: In the direction we're headed?

00:53:35.658 --> 00:53:36.698
MATT: Yes.

00:53:36.698 --> 00:53:38.515
SAM: Let's take on after them.

00:53:38.515 --> 00:53:45.664
DARIN: Yeah. Because, well, what goblins are
afraid of, no offense to you, we are not afraid

00:53:45.664 --> 00:53:51.009
of. We're better than goblins, no offense to you.

00:53:51.009 --> 00:53:52.368
TRAVIS: Again, no.

00:53:52.368 --> 00:53:53.528
DARIN: Yeah. Are we going?

00:53:53.528 --> 00:53:59.809
TRAVIS: No wait, you need your tattoo, yours is
done, it's on the lower back. Where would you like

00:53:59.809 --> 00:54:01.084
your Forcs tattoo?

00:54:01.084 --> 00:54:02.968
LAURA: You want one on your arm like I got?

00:54:02.968 --> 00:54:04.888
DARIN: See this head on my helmet?

00:54:04.888 --> 00:54:05.769
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:54:05.769 --> 00:54:14.770
DARIN: Put it up there. Because this will cause
true terror in any goblin, again, no offense to you.

00:54:14.770 --> 00:54:18.338
TRAVIS: Thank you. We'll get it later, we should
probably get after them.

00:54:18.338 --> 00:54:22.528
DARIN: Take this helmet and do it as we run! You
are a true artiste.

00:54:22.528 --> 00:54:27.497
LAURA: But we got to take a short rest though,
right, while we were getting our tattoos though.

00:54:27.497 --> 00:54:29.109
Was that a short rest?

00:54:29.109 --> 00:54:33.904
MATT: Okay, so you take a short rest outside of
the chambers of Warchief Barfta who has been

00:54:33.904 --> 00:54:39.398
trying to get you to leave for the past 20-- the
chamber is just in flames around him, he's just

00:54:39.398 --> 00:54:42.363
sitting there drinking like "Leave! Me!"

00:54:42.363 --> 00:54:50.058
DARIN: We have, technically, we are outside the
room, technically we have left. He agrees.

00:54:50.058 --> 00:54:51.871
MATT: "Smartass."

00:54:51.871 --> 00:54:53.669
SAM: Do I get ki points back?

00:54:53.669 --> 00:54:54.670
MATT: You do.

00:54:54.670 --> 00:54:55.558
SAM: All?

00:54:55.558 --> 00:54:56.359
MATT: Yep.

00:54:56.359 --> 00:55:00.159
SAM: Holy moly, I'm so powerful! Wow!

00:55:00.159 --> 00:55:02.539
DARIN: Must we roll to get hit points back?

00:55:02.539 --> 00:55:04.678
SAM: Hit dice. It will say right there.

00:55:04.678 --> 00:55:06.149
DARIN: Oh! Well, that's nice.

00:55:06.149 --> 00:55:08.835
LAURA: What's shrak mean again? Is that a dick?

00:55:08.835 --> 00:55:12.191
SAM: No. Shrak is feces.

00:55:12.191 --> 00:55:13.918
MATT: Excrement.

00:55:13.918 --> 00:55:16.789
LAURA: Okay. A gronk is a dick?

00:55:16.789 --> 00:55:26.719
SAM: A gronk is a dick. How will we chase after
these bad guys? Are we going to ride on something,

00:55:26.719 --> 00:55:28.529
or should we just walk? Do we need a cart?

00:55:28.529 --> 00:55:30.999
TRAVIS: Do we have any mounts available?

00:55:30.999 --> 00:55:32.639
DARIN: Do we see any carangors?

00:55:32.639 --> 00:55:40.040
MATT: You do have, in this encampment, three
carangors, that are caged, feral. They haven't

00:55:40.040 --> 00:55:44.399
been broken yet. But they are currently caged in
the corner, you could see a few beastmasters that

00:55:44.399 --> 00:55:49.030
roam about. As you walk up to approach and take a
look, you see one of them has a pike with this long,

00:55:49.030 --> 00:55:53.731
slivering piece of meat that has a little bit of
skin on it still, and you think may have belonged

00:55:53.765 --> 00:55:58.109
to one of the uruks that just got killed in the
fray and just throws into the cage. Immediately,

00:55:58.109 --> 00:56:08.651
this extremely large, hyena dog-like hybrid beast
starts tearing it apart, getting gore everywhere.

00:56:08.651 --> 00:56:12.387
TRAVIS: See, I'm afraid that would be us, if we
tried to ride them.

00:56:12.387 --> 00:56:14.370
SAM: Are you scared of a carangor?

00:56:14.370 --> 00:56:16.087
TRAVIS: Very much so. Yeah, I mean, look at them.

00:56:16.087 --> 00:56:18.516
SAM: I've killed so many carangor.

00:56:18.516 --> 00:56:20.061
TRAVIS: I haven't.

00:56:20.061 --> 00:56:21.537
SAM: I haven't either.

00:56:21.537 --> 00:56:26.237
LAURA: You could ride on my back. I could give you
a piggyback ride.

00:56:26.237 --> 00:56:29.807
TRAVIS: Not that I need it, but I will accept.

00:56:29.807 --> 00:56:34.466
LAURA: Because I think we're too big to ride this
scatagorse.

00:56:34.466 --> 00:56:36.838
SAM: The scatagorus?

00:56:36.838 --> 00:56:37.957
LAURA: Yeah.

00:56:37.957 --> 00:56:40.388
DARIN: Yeah, close enough.

00:56:40.388 --> 00:56:44.896
SAM: All right. Well then, we will go on foot.
Right?

00:56:44.896 --> 00:56:47.746
LAURA: I don't know. Are we too big?

00:56:47.746 --> 00:56:53.215
MATT: I mean, it's a big beast. You can certainly
try.

00:56:53.215 --> 00:56:55.821
SAM: Is anyone good with animals?

00:56:55.821 --> 00:57:00.661
TRAVIS and DARIN: Nope.

00:57:00.661 --> 00:57:04.673
LAURA and SAM: Maybe we should walk.

00:57:04.673 --> 00:57:08.338
(laughter)

00:57:08.338 --> 00:57:11.972
MATT: As you guys are having this conversation,
you see one of the beastmasters is by the cage,

00:57:11.972 --> 00:57:16.867
looking at you with his head turned to the side,
curious as to what you're talking about. And

00:57:16.867 --> 00:57:22.118
immediately, this claw grabs him and pulls him
against the cage, (screaming) as one of the jaws

00:57:22.118 --> 00:57:26.548
grabs and tears his shoulder off from the back. He
goes, (grunting). The other uruks start hitting it with

00:57:26.548 --> 00:57:30.337
pikes from the side of the cage, to calm it down,
but it's already torn the guy apart. You're like,

00:57:30.372 --> 00:57:31.508
this is bad.

00:57:31.508 --> 00:57:35.080
DARIN: We're walking, we are walking.

00:57:35.080 --> 00:57:40.702
MATT: Okay. So as you guys exit the outside of the
fortress on the outskirts of Nargroth, you begin

00:57:40.702 --> 00:57:43.898
to make your way eastward towards the mountains,
in the direction where you saw these fleeing

00:57:43.898 --> 00:57:47.978
goblins. Who's helming this journey? Who wants to
be tracking eastward?

00:57:47.978 --> 00:57:51.458
LAURA: Well, he has the head on his helmet, so he
can probably see farther than the rest of us.

00:57:51.501 --> 00:58:01.678
DARIN: Yes, but the eyes are missing. If you gave
me a couple of your eyes, we could stick them in there.

00:58:01.678 --> 00:58:06.407
LAURA: Here's a couple. They don't match, but
that's all right.

00:58:06.407 --> 00:58:11.018
DARIN: It's just eyes. So I'll take out a couple
of the eyes, I take off my helmet, and I put them

00:58:11.018 --> 00:58:20.039
in. And now, I am known as Mozuu the Chosen, the
tracker with the helmet that has the head with

00:58:20.039 --> 00:58:22.127
the eyes in it currently.

00:58:22.127 --> 00:58:29.887
LAURA: Upgrade. I'm going to take Skak and I'm
going to sit him on my shoulder.

00:58:29.887 --> 00:58:32.209
TRAVIS: (frantic noises)

00:58:32.209 --> 00:58:37.029
MATT: As he's slowly carving-- well no, if you
have the helmet on to track, he can't carve into

00:58:37.029 --> 00:58:41.702
it as you're moving. So a choice has to be
made.

00:58:41.702 --> 00:58:46.891
DARIN: Well, the eyes will be able to see as
you're carving. You tell me what they see, we go

00:58:46.891 --> 00:58:48.147
that way.

00:58:48.147 --> 00:58:49.741
TRAVIS: I'm to interpret the eyes?

00:58:49.741 --> 00:58:53.978
DARIN: Exactly. That what makes us a team! That's
what makes us the Forcs, apparently.

00:58:53.978 --> 00:58:58.394
ALL: The Forcs!

00:58:58.394 --> 00:59:00.651
MATT: So I want you to make a dexterity check.

00:59:00.651 --> 00:59:05.082
TRAVIS: (laughs) That was good. Oh, that's a
million. 22.

00:59:05.082 --> 00:59:12.460
MATT: 22. You, of all the scars you've carved
across the group, you saved the best for Mozuu.

00:59:12.460 --> 00:59:19.941
Even though it's a bumpy ride on the back of an
olog, it's a beautiful display on this helmet.

00:59:19.941 --> 00:59:23.112
TRAVIS: It's got mosaic work, filigree! It's
really nice.

00:59:23.112 --> 00:59:26.551
MATT: You're really proud of it, and also roll a
perception check, because you're now the person

00:59:26.551 --> 00:59:28.050
interpreting the eyes.

00:59:28.050 --> 00:59:32.412
TRAVIS: Oh good. Minus two. 14.

00:59:32.412 --> 00:59:37.422
MATT: 14. Okay. So as you glance about, and you
take a little while, heading forward, you begin to

00:59:37.422 --> 00:59:43.146
find the easiest path up the mountainside. As
opposed to having to climb cliff over cliff, you

00:59:43.146 --> 00:59:49.670
guys eventually hit the base of the Mithram Spur
Mountains, and begin to slowly pull your way up

00:59:49.670 --> 00:59:55.916
the occasional cliffside, but for the most part,
you've managed to maintain a fairly easy to climb

00:59:55.916 --> 01:00:02.402
switchback path that has been walked through this
mountain range a number of times. Make a survival

01:00:02.402 --> 01:00:04.221
check for me, please.

01:00:04.221 --> 01:00:06.759
LAURA: You hear those people screaming in the
background?

01:00:06.759 --> 01:00:08.000
SAM and DARIN: Yes.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:11.831
TRAVIS: I literally rolled a zero. Two minus two.

01:00:11.831 --> 01:00:20.482
MATT: All right. So as you guys begin to curl up
and down the edge of this mountain range, you

01:00:20.482 --> 01:00:27.922
can see the large fortress of Nargroth in the
distance, and the outskirts of the one small watch

01:00:27.922 --> 01:00:32.101
fortress on the outside of it, the three of which
dot its exterior. The one furthest to the east

01:00:32.101 --> 01:00:37.702
that you just came from begins to disappear over
the high mountain spires and now, in the dark

01:00:37.702 --> 01:00:44.172
skies, the black of night, just the faint glow of
orange-red in the distance as Mount Doom

01:00:44.172 --> 01:00:50.328
occasionally flares up into the clouds ahead. It is
very dark. Thankfully, I believe most of you have

01:00:50.328 --> 01:00:51.695
some form of darkvision.

01:00:51.695 --> 01:00:53.122
TRAVIS: 60 feet.

01:00:53.122 --> 01:00:54.218
LAURA: And torches.

01:00:54.218 --> 01:01:01.236
MATT: Yep. Great, so you guys are able to make
your way through, following the wonderful

01:01:01.236 --> 01:01:03.002
direction of Skak on top.

01:01:03.002 --> 01:01:06.253
TRAVIS: The eyes speak often. They lead us forth.

01:01:06.253 --> 01:01:12.527
SAM: I've noticed that one of those eyes is a
wolf's eye, and the other is an acorn. Is that

01:01:12.527 --> 01:01:13.883
going to...

01:01:13.883 --> 01:01:20.638
TRAVIS: No. Shouldn't make any difference. Both
the land and the beast speak to me through the eyes.

01:01:20.638 --> 01:01:24.832
MATT: Leading you with absolute confidence up the
side of this mountain path.

01:01:24.832 --> 01:01:31.540
DARIN: Because an acorn is technically a seed.
And you can't spell seed without &lt;i&gt;see&lt;/i&gt;.

01:01:31.540 --> 01:01:34.011
TRAVIS: I don't know if that's right.

01:01:34.011 --> 01:01:44.475
DARIN: S-E-E is "see." S-E-E-E-D-D-D-D-D is
"seed." Therefore, you could, if you wanted to.

01:01:44.475 --> 01:01:45.756
TRAVIS: Extrapolate.

01:01:45.756 --> 01:01:54.962
MATT: And it's at that moment, (laughs) Arby, as
your large foot hits a soft mound of dirt, a large

01:01:54.962 --> 01:02:04.555
one, one about maybe 25 or so feet across.
Your foot hits it. The mountain seems to give way

01:02:04.585 --> 01:02:10.228
for a moment into a little bit of a plateau, and
there looks to be packed ash and dirt that fills

01:02:10.228 --> 01:02:14.406
this small vicinity. And while you were conversing
and listening and following the direction of Skak,

01:02:14.406 --> 01:02:16.555
your foot hits this soft mound.

01:02:16.555 --> 01:02:21.726
LAURA: Hey, something's down here. It's softer. I
start stomping on it.

01:02:21.726 --> 01:02:29.519
MATT: Okay. I would like all of you to make an
intelligence check, please.

01:02:29.519 --> 01:02:32.456
DARIN: Five.

01:02:32.456 --> 01:02:33.389
SAM: Seven.

01:02:33.389 --> 01:02:34.399
LAURA: 14.

01:02:34.399 --> 01:02:37.876
TRAVIS: 18. This is new for me, guys!

01:02:37.876 --> 01:02:40.216
(laughter)

01:02:40.216 --> 01:02:45.486
MATT: So as all of you begin to follow suit with
Arby and stomping on the soft dirt, you're like,

01:02:45.486 --> 01:02:48.587
wait, we've raided some of these before.

01:02:48.587 --> 01:02:53.966
TRAVIS: Wait a second. Yeah, we've all got
experience with this.

01:02:53.966 --> 01:02:55.385
LAURA and SAM: What is it?

01:02:55.385 --> 01:03:03.516
MATT: You hear this soft growling sound as you
watch these tiny humanoid creatures with long

01:03:03.516 --> 01:03:10.382
thin arms and legs, hairless gray skin, begin to
pull their way out of small holes and tunnels in

01:03:10.382 --> 01:03:16.227
the sides of this mound. You watch as ghouls began
to emerge now from the recent disturbing of their space.

01:03:16.227 --> 01:03:18.934
LAURA: I hate ghouls.

01:03:18.934 --> 01:03:26.427
SAM: But the Forcs can take them. Forcs! It's
dinner time!

01:03:26.427 --> 01:03:30.246
MATT: Because you rolled so high on the intelligence
check, you do know that they have a hard time with

01:03:30.322 --> 01:03:33.356
bright light. However, I would like you all to
roll initiative because they are immediately

01:03:33.356 --> 01:03:35.780
lunging towards you. (snarls)

01:03:35.780 --> 01:03:38.927
TRAVIS: Remember, they have a hard time with
bright light!

01:03:38.927 --> 01:03:42.707
SAM: (laughs) Thank you, Lady Guinevere.

01:03:42.707 --> 01:03:44.979
(laughter)

01:03:44.979 --> 01:03:46.777
LAURA: You had a torch, right, in your hand?

01:03:46.777 --> 01:03:49.968
DARIN: We're using darkvision. Some of us.

01:03:49.968 --> 01:03:51.247
SAM: Totally black.

01:03:51.350 --> 01:03:53.393
DARIN: Yep. Let's go back in time. Did anyone--

01:03:53.393 --> 01:03:56.758
LAURA: I did mention torches, but I didn't say I
pulled it out.

01:03:56.758 --> 01:04:00.325
MATT: You can see four of them have emerged, and
it looks like more are making their way out. So.

01:04:00.325 --> 01:04:04.539
All right, initiative order. What do you have?

01:04:04.539 --> 01:04:06.719
DARIN: 11.

01:04:06.719 --> 01:04:08.254
SAM: 17.

01:04:08.254 --> 01:04:09.680
LAURA: 11.

01:04:09.680 --> 01:04:13.090
TRAVIS: 18.

01:04:13.090 --> 01:04:15.131
ALL: Ooh.

01:04:15.131 --> 01:04:24.121
MATT: All right. Skak, you're up first. As you
kept the helmet in your hand, you're like

01:04:24.121 --> 01:04:25.372
(hesitating).

01:04:25.372 --> 01:04:26.842
TRAVIS: How far away are they?

01:04:26.842 --> 01:04:31.605
MATT: There are two of them that are ten feet from
you now, rushing in your direction, and a few that are

01:04:31.605 --> 01:04:35.303
about 25 or 30 feet on the other side of the
mound that are now climbing over it and

01:04:35.339 --> 01:04:39.171
darting towards you. You move first, though, so
there's nobody quite in range or no one who's

01:04:39.171 --> 01:04:41.065
attacking you yet.

01:04:41.147 --> 01:04:48.872
TRAVIS: I would like to take out one of my acid
vials, and I'm going to throw it from atop

01:04:48.872 --> 01:04:53.016
your shoulders at the two ghouls coming forward.

01:04:53.060 --> 01:04:54.949
MATT: Perfect. Okay, then.

01:04:54.949 --> 01:04:57.233
TRAVIS: Using Acid Splash.

01:04:57.233 --> 01:05:05.441
MATT: So as you chuck it out, there are two of
them that are side by side that are emerging on

01:05:05.441 --> 01:05:08.467
the opposite side within range, so you could
probably hit them both. So I need you to go ahead

01:05:08.467 --> 01:05:15.392
and roll-- actually, no, it's a dexterity saving
throw on their point. Okay, so strangely enough,

01:05:15.392 --> 01:05:24.089
they both succeed. An 18 and a 20. You throw it,
and they're so fast as they dart past. They're

01:05:24.089 --> 01:05:29.172
small and they're wiry and they're lively, and as
soon as you throw and lob it, the both just separate

01:05:29.172 --> 01:05:33.383
and it splashes harmlessly on the ground below them.
You see the acid burn up. No effect, unfortunately.

01:05:33.383 --> 01:05:38.467
TRAVIS: Can I use my bonus action to nimble
escape, and I want to jump off your shoulders and hide.

01:05:38.467 --> 01:05:43.325
MATT: Sure, yeah. So we'll say you dart off, and
go ahead and roll a stealth check.

01:05:43.325 --> 01:05:47.725
TRAVIS: Nice. 20.

01:05:47.725 --> 01:05:52.095
MATT: Okay! Good to know. So that's you. You're
hidden. That ends Skak's turn. Eden, you're up.

01:05:52.095 --> 01:05:55.732
SAM: So there's two close together and two
others?

01:05:55.732 --> 01:06:00.523
MATT: Well, they've now separated a little bit.
There's four now rushing right in the front, and

01:06:00.523 --> 01:06:03.699
they're somewhat close. You can get in between two
of them and hit both.

01:06:03.699 --> 01:06:05.163
LAURA: Do we all have darkvision?

01:06:05.163 --> 01:06:06.712
MATT: I believe you do, yeah.

01:06:06.712 --> 01:06:12.402
SAM: And my flurry of blows, can that be used on
multiple targets? All right, so I'll run up to the

01:06:12.402 --> 01:06:15.557
first and quarterstaff attack.

01:06:15.557 --> 01:06:17.073
MATT: Go for it.

01:06:17.073 --> 01:06:19.828
SAM: Ooh, yeah. 23 to hit.

01:06:19.828 --> 01:06:22.058
MATT: 23 hits, yeah. Go ahead and roll damage.

01:06:22.058 --> 01:06:25.328
SAM: Seven.

01:06:25.328 --> 01:06:32.741
MATT: Seven points? All righty. So as you rush up
and-- by the way, as an olog-hai, you're a big

01:06:32.741 --> 01:06:38.230
troll-like entity. The quarterstaff in your hands
is like that long. It's like a tiny little baton.

01:06:38.230 --> 01:06:46.313
You smack it, and you dislocate its shoulder. And
it gives a horrible pained sound as it does so. It's

01:06:46.313 --> 01:06:50.044
hurt pretty bad. These things are not very hardy,
there's just a lot of them.

01:06:50.044 --> 01:06:53.459
SAM: All right. I will flurry of blows and strike
him with my hand.

01:06:53.459 --> 01:06:54.881
MATT: All right. Go for it.

01:06:54.881 --> 01:06:57.751
SAM: Ew, 11.

01:06:57.751 --> 01:07:03.378
MATT: 11 does not hit, unfortunately. You're too
confident at this point. As you swing a second

01:07:03.378 --> 01:07:05.389
time, it ducks below, missing.

01:07:05.389 --> 01:07:10.460
SAM: I'll strike again with my hand. (yelps) Oh,
that one's better. 19.

01:07:10.460 --> 01:07:12.050
MATT: 19. Go ahead and roll damage.

01:07:12.050 --> 01:07:16.771
SAM: Six points of damage.

01:07:16.771 --> 01:07:20.266
MATT: And with that, you slam down and crumple its
head into its shoulder. It makes

01:07:20.266 --> 01:07:25.669
this gurgle sound as it falls to the ground. And
there's one who's now rushing up behind you that

01:07:25.669 --> 01:07:27.869
you can move into and get your final attack, if
you want.

01:07:27.869 --> 01:07:29.720
SAM: With my hand, right? My bonus--

01:07:29.720 --> 01:07:31.379
MATT: Hand, or your staff.

01:07:31.379 --> 01:07:33.929
SAM: All right. Well, then I will quarterstaff him
in the gut!

01:07:33.929 --> 01:07:36.489
MATT: All right, go for it. So you run up and use
that momentum.

01:07:36.489 --> 01:07:38.858
SAM: Oh yeah! 18 plus seven. Ooh! 25.

01:07:38.858 --> 01:07:40.528
MATT: That hits. Yeah, roll damage.

01:07:40.528 --> 01:07:45.748
SAM: One. So five.

01:07:45.748 --> 01:07:51.637
MATT: Five points of damage. All right, so it hits
him, and he gives this guttural loss of air sound,

01:07:51.637 --> 01:07:53.681
but it's still standing without an issue.

01:07:53.681 --> 01:07:56.439
SAM: Is that a part of the flurry of blows attack,
or is that when I bonus attack?

01:07:56.439 --> 01:08:00.836
MATT: Well, the flurry of blows becomes your
bonus. You do two attacks instead of one with your

01:08:00.836 --> 01:08:02.271
bonus is what flurry does.

01:08:02.271 --> 01:08:06.980
SAM: Okay. So if I hit someone with a flurry of
blows, he must succeed on a dexterity saving throw

01:08:06.980 --> 01:08:08.505
or be knocked prone.

01:08:08.505 --> 01:08:15.493
MATT: Oh shit. With an eight, no, he does not. So
the one you slam, while it doesn't kill him, it

01:08:15.493 --> 01:08:20.249
knocks him off his feet, and it falls to the
ground. It's clawing to find purchase to get

01:08:20.249 --> 01:08:21.851
itself back to its feet.

01:08:21.851 --> 01:08:29.716
SAM: All right, Forcs. Appetizer course is over. I
don't know how far I can take this metaphor!

01:08:29.716 --> 01:08:32.695
(laughter)

01:08:32.695 --> 01:08:35.240
DARIN: All the way till dessert, is what I think!

01:08:35.240 --> 01:08:39.201
SAM: Salad course!

01:08:39.201 --> 01:08:46.819
MATT: With that, the remaining five... or the four
that aren't currently prone, rush up-- the one

01:08:46.819 --> 01:08:50.730
that was prone gets up with its turn and it's
going to go ahead and strike at you. It can't move

01:08:50.783 --> 01:08:55.823
anywhere, because it's no longer prone.
Something's going to strike at you-- okay, that's

01:08:55.823 --> 01:08:58.141
a 23 to hit?

01:08:58.141 --> 01:08:59.190
SAM: Yes.

01:08:59.190 --> 01:09:05.563
MATT: You take seven points of slashing damage
from its bite attack-- sorry, it's from the

01:09:05.563 --> 01:09:09.831
scratch attack as it strikes across you with its
claw. It rolled max damage. It's going to attempt

01:09:09.831 --> 01:09:15.031
to bite at you. That's a nine, which does not hit
you. So it strikes you with its claw, then goes to

01:09:15.031 --> 01:09:22.735
bite you and its jaw hits your armored flesh,
your hide, and can't seem to pierce it. Another one

01:09:22.735 --> 01:09:28.347
rushes to the side to try and gang up on you. It tries
to climb onto your back. That is a 16 to hit.

01:09:28.347 --> 01:09:29.476
What's your armor class?

01:09:29.476 --> 01:09:30.383
SAM: 17.

01:09:30.383 --> 01:09:34.993
MATT: 17! It jumps onto your back but it can't
pierce your hard hide, while another one-- a third

01:09:34.993 --> 01:09:40.375
one is going to rush up behind you as well. That
one is going to be a 21 to hit.

01:09:40.375 --> 01:09:41.485
SAM: Yes.

01:09:41.485 --> 01:09:46.549
MATT: And that one takes-- you take three points
of slashing damage as it rakes into your back and

01:09:46.549 --> 01:09:50.726
it gets up onto your shoulders. It's going to
attempt to bite down on the top of your head. With

01:09:50.726 --> 01:09:57.336
a ten. As it bites down once again, it just can't
seem to bite through your thick olog hide. Those

01:09:57.336 --> 01:10:03.761
are the three ghouls that are on you. Two more
emerge from the mound and began rushing in.

01:10:03.761 --> 01:10:09.495
However, they cannot get into combat right now and
still attack. The-- let's see, there's two more.

01:10:09.495 --> 01:10:14.066
One of them is going to rush towards you, Mozuu, and one's
going to rush around trying to look--

01:10:14.066 --> 01:10:15.513
LAURA: (sings)

01:10:15.597 --> 01:10:17.993
MATT: Oh, that would've been amazing.

01:10:17.993 --> 01:10:19.664
TRAVIS: No more eagles.

01:10:19.664 --> 01:10:27.044
MATT: (laughs) Good! That works to your favor.
Actually, no, that's going to be two on Mozuu.

01:10:27.114 --> 01:10:30.404
Because they don't know where you are and they're
a little scared of you at the moment. All right,

01:10:30.437 --> 01:10:32.070
that's going to be a 21?

01:10:32.111 --> 01:10:33.969
DARIN: 21 points of damage?

01:10:33.969 --> 01:10:36.656
MATT: No, 21 to hit. What's your armor class?

01:10:36.656 --> 01:10:38.336
DARIN: Yeah, it hits. Because I'm an 18.

01:10:38.336 --> 01:10:42.940
MATT: All right. So you take two points of slashing
damage from the scratch, and 18?

01:10:43.027 --> 01:10:44.300
DARIN: Yeah.

01:10:44.300 --> 01:10:50.892
MATT: You take three points of piercing damage from
the bite. The other one that swung up to you,

01:10:50.892 --> 01:11:01.751
because this one is now currently flanking you
with the other one, that is a 23 to hit, which I

01:11:01.751 --> 01:11:05.804
believe hits. And then 24 to hit. 18 and 19.

01:11:05.804 --> 01:11:08.277
SAM: Mozuu! They have chosen you!

01:11:08.277 --> 01:11:09.418
TRAVIS: Yeah! (laughs)

01:11:09.418 --> 01:11:10.648
DARIN: It's part of my name.

01:11:10.648 --> 01:11:15.669
MATT: That's seven points of slashing damage plus
an additional 1d4. So you get an additional one,

01:11:15.697 --> 01:11:20.754
so it's eight points of slashing damage. And
second strike is going to be-- damage-wise,

01:11:20.754 --> 01:11:26.486
(counting) ooh, nine points of piercing damage.

01:11:26.486 --> 01:11:29.024
TRAVIS: Ding!

01:11:29.102 --> 01:11:30.775
LAURA: How are you at? What's your health at?

01:11:30.775 --> 01:11:35.353
MATT: They're ganging up on you. You get the
sense, individually they are not very dangerous,

01:11:35.353 --> 01:11:40.225
necessarily. They go down pretty quick. But when
they gang up, it's bad, and they're ganging up on

01:11:40.225 --> 01:11:41.519
Mozuu right now.

01:11:41.519 --> 01:11:43.225
TRAVIS: I've heard this before about ghouls.

01:11:43.225 --> 01:11:46.336
MATT: So ending that turn. Arby, you're up.

01:11:46.336 --> 01:11:50.364
LAURA: I'm going to-- you said they're susceptible
to bright light?

01:11:50.364 --> 01:11:51.375
TRAVIS: Bright light!

01:11:51.375 --> 01:11:57.224
LAURA: All right. I'm going to pull out my torch
and I'm going to hold it in the same hand with my

01:11:57.224 --> 01:12:00.000
maul, because I got big hands. And then I'm going
to swing it.

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:03.062
MATT: Okay. I'm going to say it takes an action
for you to light the torch--

01:12:03.062 --> 01:12:08.439
LAURA: Oh, I have to light? No, I didn't light it.
As a bonus action, I took it out but I didn't

01:12:08.439 --> 01:12:09.574
light it.

01:12:09.574 --> 01:12:11.134
MATT: Okay, so you're just holding it? Okay.

01:12:11.134 --> 01:12:12.482
SAM: Hoping that'll be enough light?

01:12:12.544 --> 01:12:17.870
LAURA: Yeah. And then I'm going to try to hit the
ones that were attacking Mozuu.

01:12:17.870 --> 01:12:24.060
MATT: So you lumber up with an unlit torch,
clasped in your hand with your maul, and you're

01:12:24.060 --> 01:12:26.485
going to attack the ones against Mozuu. All right.
Roll for the first attack.

01:12:26.485 --> 01:12:27.971
LAURA: (laughs) Okay.

01:12:27.971 --> 01:12:31.171
SAM: It must cast some light.

01:12:31.171 --> 01:12:35.062
LAURA: Yeah! I mean, that's what torches do.

01:12:35.062 --> 01:12:36.771
(laughter)

01:12:36.771 --> 01:12:40.900
LAURA: Twenty-- I suck at this particular number
combination. 21.

01:12:40.900 --> 01:12:42.980
MATT: 21 hits. Yeah, go and roll damage.

01:12:42.980 --> 01:12:44.770
SAM: It's a 20 and a one.

01:12:44.770 --> 01:12:46.534
LAURA: Yeah.

01:12:46.534 --> 01:12:47.999
DARIN: Apparently it's forever.

01:12:47.999 --> 01:12:50.005
LAURA: Ooh, that's good. That's 15.

01:12:50.005 --> 01:12:51.672
MATT: 15 points of damage?

01:12:51.672 --> 01:12:52.561
LAURA: Yeah.

01:12:52.561 --> 01:12:56.257
MATT: With one strike, you splatter this ghoul
across the mound. You see its arms and legs go

01:12:56.257 --> 01:12:59.529
flying apart as its torso is crushed and
destroyed. It's in pieces.

01:12:59.529 --> 01:13:01.099
LAURA: I'm going to attack another one.

01:13:01.099 --> 01:13:03.731
SAM: Does the torso light the torch?

01:13:03.731 --> 01:13:08.902
MATT: Nope. (laughs) It's important to know.

01:13:08.902 --> 01:13:10.201
LAURA: 11.

01:13:10.201 --> 01:13:11.223
MATT: 11 just hits.

01:13:11.223 --> 01:13:18.497
LAURA: Yeah! Oh, I get to reroll that. Yes! 14.

01:13:18.497 --> 01:13:23.178
MATT: 14 points of damage. You splatter a second
one. You come swinging, and with each hit, the one

01:13:23.178 --> 01:13:27.735
to the left and the one to the right of Mozuu are
both turned to absolute unliving matter.

01:13:27.735 --> 01:13:32.026
LAURA: So there's two more of them on Mozuu? There's
two more on Mozuu?

01:13:32.026 --> 01:13:38.117
MATT: No, the two that are on Mozuu are gone.
There's three that are now climbing up on Eden

01:13:38.117 --> 01:13:40.252
that have been trying to strike through.

01:13:40.252 --> 01:13:44.934
LAURA: I'm going to turn. I'm going to use my
action surge to hit two more to try to hit them.

01:13:44.934 --> 01:13:47.152
MATT: All right. So you use the last bit of your
movement. This will be the end of your

01:13:47.152 --> 01:13:49.600
movement to get to Eden, but you can attack two
that are on him.

01:13:49.600 --> 01:13:52.374
LAURA: That's 14.

01:13:52.374 --> 01:13:53.684
MATT: 14 hits.

01:13:53.684 --> 01:14:02.688
LAURA: I've got to keep that eight. Five is...
eight plus five is 12-- 13? No.

01:14:02.688 --> 01:14:06.234
MATT: Eight plus five is 13. That's correct.

01:14:06.234 --> 01:14:07.551
LAURA: 13.

01:14:07.551 --> 01:14:15.988
MATT: You actually slam the maul into the side of
Eden. Eden, you take just a simple three points of

01:14:15.988 --> 01:14:22.504
bludgeoning damage, but the ghoul that was
currently clasped onto your side is smeared

01:14:22.551 --> 01:14:24.793
against you. There is a spray of dark crimson.

01:14:24.793 --> 01:14:31.177
LAURA: I've got one more attack here. Ooh, that's
good. That definitely hits. 24.

01:14:31.177 --> 01:14:32.933
MATT: Yeah. Roll damage.

01:14:32.933 --> 01:14:35.401
LAURA: Ooh! 15!

01:14:35.401 --> 01:14:40.834
MATT: 15. And with that, you splattered the one on
the other side, the back shoulder portion of Eden,

01:14:40.834 --> 01:14:47.815
and this time, you don't slam it &lt;i&gt;into&lt;/i&gt; Eden, you
just swing wide and you baseball-bat slam

01:14:47.815 --> 01:14:52.474
it, sending it flying 30, 40 feet arcing through
the sky. (ghoul screaming) There's still the one

01:14:52.474 --> 01:14:54.625
of top of his shoulders. You got four in one
round!

01:14:54.625 --> 01:14:57.420
LAURA: Yeah. &lt;i&gt;You're welcome.&lt;/i&gt;

01:14:57.420 --> 01:14:59.418
SAM: I don't know what that means.

01:14:59.418 --> 01:15:01.142
MATT: While this is happening, Mozuu, it's your
turn.

01:15:01.142 --> 01:15:02.794
DARIN: There are two in the distance?

01:15:02.794 --> 01:15:08.824
MATT: There are two more. There's one that got up
on the ground that's in front of Eden, there's

01:15:08.824 --> 01:15:13.535
one that's rushing in, and there's one that's on
top of Eden's shoulders right now.

01:15:13.535 --> 01:15:18.845
DARIN: I'll go for the one that's on top of Eden's
shoulders. I want to pull him off and bite, and

01:15:18.845 --> 01:15:20.644
try and rip his throat out?

01:15:20.644 --> 01:15:23.842
MATT: Okay.

01:15:23.842 --> 01:15:27.867
TRAVIS: Wow. Said so casually! "I would like to
bite and--"

01:15:27.867 --> 01:15:36.407
MATT: As you rush up to the side to grab it, make
a grapple check. Roll an athletics check.

01:15:36.407 --> 01:15:42.712
DARIN: Okay. Oh! 12.

01:15:42.712 --> 01:15:49.555
MATT: The ghoul rolled a natural one. Without an
issue, you peel the ghoul off its back. Do you

01:15:49.555 --> 01:15:54.788
want to lunge for its throat? All right, roll an
attack.

01:15:54.788 --> 01:15:59.129
DARIN: 12 plus my strength?

01:15:59.129 --> 01:16:00.585
MATT: Plus your strength, yeah.

01:16:00.585 --> 01:16:01.671
DARIN: 15.

01:16:01.671 --> 01:16:05.872
MATT: 15. Okay. Roll a 1d4 and add your strength
modifier and damage to it.

01:16:05.872 --> 01:16:14.517
DARIN: That would be 16, my modifier? Three! So
six.

01:16:14.517 --> 01:16:20.612
MATT: Six points of damage. So as you pull the
ghoul off, it's screeching. You grab it by the

01:16:20.612 --> 01:16:25.169
back of the head, pull it back, sink your teeth
into its throat and tear a chunk out. It's not a

01:16:25.169 --> 01:16:28.979
mortal wound, but now it's missing part of its
throat, and its screeching goes from a (screech)

01:16:28.979 --> 01:16:32.849
to (moan) this horrible sucking sound as part of
its trachea is now exposed.

01:16:32.849 --> 01:16:36.932
DARIN: I get another attack. It says, "you can
make two attacks."

01:16:36.932 --> 01:16:38.208
MATT: Oh, right.

01:16:38.208 --> 01:16:41.970
DARIN: When you make an attack action, you can
make two attacks. I want to attack his throat again.

01:16:41.970 --> 01:16:47.103
MATT: Go for it. He has a bonus action. War
cleric.

01:16:47.103 --> 01:16:50.609
DARIN: That's a 15. That is an 18.

01:16:50.609 --> 01:16:52.320
MATT: That hits. Roll another d4.

01:16:52.320 --> 01:16:54.988
DARIN: That's another six.

01:16:54.988 --> 01:16:59.353
MATT: As you pull away the first piece of flesh,
you spit it to the side. As this horrible sucking

01:16:59.353 --> 01:17:03.548
screech sound happens, you reach down this time,
getting a larger bite into its throat, and as you

01:17:03.548 --> 01:17:07.839
pull back, you leave nothing but the spine left
behind, and the ghoul goes limp in your grasp, as

01:17:07.839 --> 01:17:10.389
you have the rest of its throat in your maw.

01:17:10.389 --> 01:17:13.849
DARIN: Wow. I've finally lived my dreams.

01:17:13.849 --> 01:17:16.271
(laughter)

01:17:16.271 --> 01:17:19.185
MATT: All right, that ends your turn, Mozuu? That
brings it to the top. Skak, you're up.

01:17:19.185 --> 01:17:24.429
TRAVIS: I jump out from behind where I'm hiding,
and I load my crossbow at the one that's running,

01:17:24.429 --> 01:17:26.129
and I pull the trigger.

01:17:26.129 --> 01:17:29.998
MATT: Go for it. You have advantage because it
does not see you.

01:17:29.998 --> 01:17:33.280
TRAVIS: Oh! 21.

01:17:33.280 --> 01:17:35.119
MATT: 21? All right, roll for damage.

01:17:35.119 --> 01:17:42.431
TRAVIS: 12, right? No sneak attack?

01:17:42.431 --> 01:17:44.691
MATT: No, sneak attack, because it didn't see you.
You were hidden.

01:17:44.691 --> 01:17:51.070
TRAVIS: Right. Oh, it is sneak attack? (counting)
21.

01:17:51.070 --> 01:17:52.390
LAURA: Holy moly.

01:17:52.390 --> 01:18:00.561
MATT: As it's rushing, we're talking 28 Days Later
sprinting zombie level. Falls limp, unmoving, onto

01:18:00.561 --> 01:18:03.560
the mound. The bolt went through its throat and
chest area.

01:18:03.560 --> 01:18:06.635
TRAVIS: (pants) Forcs!

01:18:06.635 --> 01:18:09.320
(laughter)

01:18:09.320 --> 01:18:10.390
TRAVIS: Forcs!

01:18:10.390 --> 01:18:16.828
MATT: You watch as three more begin to emerge from
the sides of the mound. This looks to be

01:18:16.828 --> 01:18:22.771
essentially a hive home to these, and you have no
idea how many are inside. Three more emerge.

01:18:22.771 --> 01:18:26.900
Eden, you're up.

01:18:26.900 --> 01:18:32.951
SAM: Maybe we should go? Seems like they keep
coming. Maybe we should run?

01:18:32.951 --> 01:18:38.200
TRAVIS: Yes, I remember they have a weakness to
bright light, and they live in hives. We should go!

01:18:38.200 --> 01:18:39.675
LAURA: Don't worry, I have a torch.

01:18:39.675 --> 01:18:42.899
TRAVIS: Don't light it! I think it's an unlit
torch.

01:18:42.899 --> 01:18:44.670
LAURA: Well, you said it was susceptible--

01:18:44.670 --> 01:18:49.327
TRAVIS: Don't hurt yourself. It's okay. We should
go! Mozuu?

01:18:49.327 --> 01:18:51.180
SAM: Mozuu, do we have your blessing to flee?

01:18:51.180 --> 01:18:53.565
DARIN: Look, a lot happened just now.

01:18:53.565 --> 01:18:55.730
TRAVIS: What's on your face?

01:18:55.730 --> 01:19:03.237
DARIN: It's my face. It's called fear, and a
leader can't show fear. I'm not leader anymore.

01:19:03.237 --> 01:19:05.119
You're leader.

01:19:05.119 --> 01:19:10.091
SAM: I'm leader. You hear that? Bow before me!

01:19:10.091 --> 01:19:17.818
DARIN: I bow before him. You gave me eyes, and yet
I didn't see. I didn't see this hive, and I almost

01:19:17.818 --> 01:19:21.561
died. I'm not leader. I'm not fit to lead the
Forcs.

01:19:21.561 --> 01:19:23.270
LAURA: All right.

01:19:23.270 --> 01:19:25.240
DARIN: You're leader, as well.

01:19:25.240 --> 01:19:26.616
LAURA: All right.

01:19:26.616 --> 01:19:30.310
DARIN: You're leader, too. I follow all three of
you.

01:19:30.310 --> 01:19:32.134
TRAVIS: You can't have two leaders.

01:19:32.134 --> 01:19:40.930
DARIN: There's two things I know: the Forcs have
three leaders and one follower. There's three

01:19:40.930 --> 01:19:45.810
things I know: that follower is me, and that's
it.

01:19:45.810 --> 01:19:49.480
MATT: Eden, while this is happening, it's your
turn, and you've been bowing to him.

01:19:49.480 --> 01:19:53.171
SAM: He's been bowing to me. I'm going to run.

01:19:53.171 --> 01:19:55.461
MATT: Okay. You still have one on your shoulders,
by the way.

01:19:55.461 --> 01:19:56.440
SAM: Oh.

01:19:56.440 --> 01:19:59.010
DARIN: A lovely speech.

01:19:59.010 --> 01:20:01.478
MATT: As it's trying to claw and bite you.

01:20:01.478 --> 01:20:07.178
TRAVIS: Delineating responsibility.

01:20:07.178 --> 01:20:18.211
SAM: I'm going to run and hope he falls off, like
a big bucking bronco. I'll use my step of the wind

01:20:18.248 --> 01:20:21.752
to go faster and jump really far.

01:20:21.752 --> 01:20:27.926
MATT: Okay, you full run, dash action, and use
that to move another movement. You watch as this

01:20:27.926 --> 01:20:36.890
giant olog-hai, like Wile E. Coyote, leaves behind
a cloud in his shape behind. Because you're moving

01:20:36.890 --> 01:20:43.071
that fast, I will make sure the ghoul has to make
a save to stay on. With a natural two for a

01:20:43.071 --> 01:20:48.321
strength save, no. The ghoul stumbles off,
tumbling onto the ground behind you. Gets back up

01:20:48.321 --> 01:20:54.469
onto its feet. You start bolting in an eastern
direction. Ending your turn, it's now the ghouls'

01:20:54.469 --> 01:20:58.722
turn. They cannot catch up to you. The one that
gets up tries to run after you, but it's slowly

01:20:58.722 --> 01:21:03.612
behind. The other three now begin to emerge, and
they're now rushing up towards you, seeing that

01:21:03.612 --> 01:21:09.313
you smashed so many of them in the past rounds.
Three of them. Six attacks on you. They rush in.

01:21:09.313 --> 01:21:17.665
The first one's going to go for a scratch and bite.
12? And a seven.

01:21:17.665 --> 01:21:19.111
TRAVIS: Wow!

01:21:19.111 --> 01:21:25.863
MATT: Second one up behind you. That is 18? All
right, with that, because they're ganged up on

01:21:25.863 --> 01:21:30.681
you, they do more damage. That is six points of
slashing damage.

01:21:30.681 --> 01:21:32.163
SAM: Are we leaving?

01:21:32.163 --> 01:21:34.271
DARIN: You're leaving.

01:21:34.271 --> 01:21:35.723
SAM: I thought that was the plan!

01:21:35.723 --> 01:21:37.301
MATT: It's their turn now, and then they get to
go.

01:21:37.301 --> 01:21:38.854
DARIN: Bye!

01:21:38.854 --> 01:21:41.195
MATT: That's a 21.

01:21:41.195 --> 01:21:43.153
DARIN: A leader leaves.

01:21:43.153 --> 01:21:49.272
MATT: You take five points of piercing damage as
this one claws and bites into you, and then that

01:21:49.272 --> 01:21:59.303
is a 17? No. And a nine. So they're clawing and
jumping onto you. They're scraping at the armor, but

01:21:59.303 --> 01:22:03.612
it's keeping most of them at bay. They get a few
hits, but it's not too bad. That ends their turn.

01:22:03.612 --> 01:22:05.943
That brings us to you, Arby. What are you going to
do?

01:22:05.943 --> 01:22:08.853
LAURA: I guess I'm going to try to kill these
things that were attacking me.

01:22:08.853 --> 01:22:12.343
MATT: Okay. You've got three of them on you
right now. They're climbing all over you.

01:22:12.343 --> 01:22:16.589
LAURA: Ooh! I thought that was really good, but it
wasn't. It's 18.

01:22:16.589 --> 01:22:18.062
MATT: 18 still hits. Roll damage.

01:22:18.062 --> 01:22:27.176
LAURA: (cackles) 16!

01:22:27.176 --> 01:22:34.723
MATT: 16. There's one to the side. You grab it by
the head and smash it in your grip and throw it to

01:22:34.723 --> 01:22:38.004
the ground with a slopping sound. Your next
attack?

01:22:38.004 --> 01:22:43.632
LAURA: I'm going to look down and try to hit the
one that's at my feet. That's a natural one.

01:22:43.632 --> 01:22:47.994
MATT: You try to reach for him, but he's just out
of reach, so you start spinning to try to get a

01:22:47.994 --> 01:22:51.884
better reach, but he's attached to you, so he
spins, too. You end up going in circles for the

01:22:51.884 --> 01:22:53.983
rest of your round, chasing your tail.

01:22:53.983 --> 01:22:59.453
LAURA: Eden! I thought I was supposed to run, but
I can't run!

01:22:59.453 --> 01:23:00.743
SAM: Why?

01:23:00.743 --> 01:23:02.473
LAURA: There's ghouls!

01:23:02.473 --> 01:23:04.474
MATT: Mozuu, you're up.

01:23:04.474 --> 01:23:08.880
DARIN: It worked once. I'm going to grab him and
try to rip his throat out.

01:23:08.880 --> 01:23:16.383
MATT: Okay. Now you have a taste of ghoul in your
mouth. You rush over to Arburuk. Make a grapple check.

01:23:16.383 --> 01:23:18.903
DARIN: Grapple is plus what?

01:23:18.903 --> 01:23:20.586
MATT: It's an athletics check.

01:23:20.586 --> 01:23:24.262
DARIN: Oh, great. 20.

01:23:24.262 --> 01:23:31.331
MATT: 20? All right. Rolled a 19, actually. 18
plus one for its strength. It's not enough, so you

01:23:31.331 --> 01:23:36.604
manage to grab and pull it and barely peel it off,
and you're going to try to go for its throat

01:23:36.604 --> 01:23:37.992
again? Roll an attack.

01:23:37.992 --> 01:23:44.235
DARIN: 18 plus three. That is a 21.

01:23:44.235 --> 01:23:47.526
MATT: That hits. Roll damage. 1d4 plus your
strength.

01:23:47.526 --> 01:23:51.273
DARIN: Three plus three. That is a six. We are
repeating again.

01:23:51.273 --> 01:23:53.197
MATT: All right, roll one more time.

01:23:53.197 --> 01:23:59.675
DARIN: Seven. So that's ten, so that did not.

01:23:59.675 --> 01:24:05.644
MATT: Ten does not, unfortunately. You bite one
chunk out of the middle of its clavicle area, and

01:24:05.644 --> 01:24:10.222
it's scrambling against you and pushing against
your face. As you go for the secondary bite, it

01:24:10.222 --> 01:24:15.300
jams its hand into your mouth, and you gag
for a minute and have to pull it out. It manages

01:24:15.300 --> 01:24:19.779
to stave off the fight for the moment, at least.
That ends your turn, Mozuu? Skak, you're up.

01:24:19.779 --> 01:24:22.369
TRAVIS: How many are left? Two? Three?

01:24:22.369 --> 01:24:27.097
MATT: There are three. There's one that's still
stuck to Arby, there's one that's being held by

01:24:27.097 --> 01:24:30.493
Mozuu, and there's one that fell off the shoulders
of Eden as he ran away.

01:24:30.493 --> 01:24:33.072
TRAVIS: Are any of them within 15 feet of me?

01:24:33.072 --> 01:24:37.145
MATT: From where you were, you're not that far
from Arby and Mozuu. You could probably move in

01:24:37.145 --> 01:24:38.382
pretty close, yeah.

01:24:38.382 --> 01:24:40.512
TRAVIS: I want to try and cast Thunderwave.

01:24:40.512 --> 01:24:43.449
MATT: Thunderwave? Okay.

01:24:43.449 --> 01:24:48.031
TRAVIS: It's going to hit you guys, isn't it? It
hits everybody.

01:24:48.031 --> 01:24:53.643
MATT: You can aim it in a way that will hit both
of them, but you'll hit hit either one or the other.

01:24:53.643 --> 01:24:56.380
TRAVIS: I definitely want to try to hit as many of
you as possible.

01:24:56.380 --> 01:24:59.372
(laughter)

01:24:59.372 --> 01:25:04.352
MATT: You could hit all of them, all four. You
won't hit Eden, because he's too far away, but you

01:25:04.352 --> 01:25:05.603
can hit all four of them.

01:25:05.603 --> 01:25:09.035
SAM: (shouting) Guys, are you coming or what?
Guys?

01:25:09.035 --> 01:25:12.123
MATT: Perfect.

01:25:12.123 --> 01:25:16.763
TRAVIS: May the dark lord grant me a Thunderwave?

01:25:16.763 --> 01:25:25.002
MATT: What you do is reach into your pouch and
find one of those explosives that you had earlier,

01:25:25.002 --> 01:25:36.292
and you throw it and clench backward. I need both
Mozuu and Arby to roll a constitution saving

01:25:36.292 --> 01:25:40.872
throw. I'm going to do the same. What's your spell
save DC?

01:25:40.872 --> 01:25:42.074
TRAVIS: 14.

01:25:42.074 --> 01:25:46.123
MATT: They both fail. You rolled a ten? Fail.

01:25:46.123 --> 01:25:47.787
LAURA: 13.

01:25:47.787 --> 01:25:52.493
MATT: Fail. All of you take 2d8 thunder damage,
and you're pushed ten feet away. Roll, Travis.

01:25:52.493 --> 01:25:53.757
Roll 2d8.

01:25:53.757 --> 01:25:57.482
TRAVIS: 13.

01:25:57.482 --> 01:26:02.184
LAURA: You asshole. I mean, you glob!

01:26:02.184 --> 01:26:07.994
MATT: Both of you guys take 13 points of thunder
damage and are blown ten feet back as this small

01:26:07.994 --> 01:26:15.633
rolling ball explodes in a concussive blast. Both
of the ghouls get scattered into nothing. The

01:26:15.633 --> 01:26:21.093
sound of the explosion echoes throughout the
mountains, and both of you guys get pushed back

01:26:21.129 --> 01:26:22.752
ten feet, almost landing on the ground.

01:26:22.796 --> 01:26:26.624
TRAVIS: Can I bonus action my nimble escape? To
hide?

01:26:26.624 --> 01:26:28.413
MATT: Make a stealth check.

01:26:28.413 --> 01:26:38.131
TRAVIS: 15. No, 23. Stealth is plus ten! I'm used
to the other. 23.

01:26:38.131 --> 01:26:42.186
MATT: All right, so as the explosion happens and you're
standing right where the ball rolled, you're like,

01:26:42.186 --> 01:26:46.585
"shit!" Move back behind the mound and try to
stealth and hide. Okay, that ends your turn. Both

01:26:46.585 --> 01:26:52.046
of them are detonated, at this point. There is the
one across the way that fell off that's trying to

01:26:52.046 --> 01:26:57.249
catch up to Eden but is too slow. There's none
currently out in the open, but you can hear sounds

01:26:57.249 --> 01:26:59.125
of scratching and little voices.

01:26:59.125 --> 01:27:02.556
LAURA: I can't really hear anything after that
explosion.

01:27:02.556 --> 01:27:05.676
MATT: That's true. The two of you, your bell's a
little rung. You hear this, as you're hiding up

01:27:05.676 --> 01:27:07.166
against the mound right now.

01:27:07.166 --> 01:27:10.696
TRAVIS: How many of those explosive orbs did I
use? All of them, or just two?

01:27:10.696 --> 01:27:14.177
MATT: We'll say, for as many spell slots as you
have.

01:27:14.177 --> 01:27:15.337
TRAVIS: Fair enough.

01:27:15.337 --> 01:27:20.286
MATT: All right, so that brings us to Eden.

01:27:20.286 --> 01:27:26.838
SAM: I'm 80 feet away, and my darkvision can't see
that far, so all I heard was an explosion in the

01:27:26.838 --> 01:27:38.708
dark, so I drop to my knee, and I say: As the only
surviving member of the Forcs, I will say a word

01:27:38.708 --> 01:27:47.004
to thank the great dark lord for choosing me to
carry on the mantle of this mission. And I will

01:27:47.004 --> 01:27:49.391
keep running as fast as I can away.

01:27:49.391 --> 01:27:56.535
MATT: Okay. You bolt away. This poor little ghoul
has no sight of you. As that ends your turn, it is

01:27:56.535 --> 01:28:02.266
now the ghoul's turn. It's like, (panting). It's
lost and doesn't see you. It's going to make a

01:28:02.266 --> 01:28:07.278
perception check. Nope! It begins scrambling its
way back toward the mound.

01:28:07.278 --> 01:28:09.207
LAURA: Does it know where home is?

01:28:09.207 --> 01:28:12.637
MATT: We'll find out. The rest of this story is
the saddest little ghoul.

01:28:12.637 --> 01:28:15.726
SAM: It's like Benji.

01:28:15.726 --> 01:28:19.715
MATT: Three more ghouls emerge from the inside of
the mound.

01:28:19.715 --> 01:28:27.833
DARIN: We can take it. Earth ghouls are easy.
Thank you! Sorry.

01:28:27.833 --> 01:28:29.611
TRAVIS: Some of them are apparently explosive.

01:28:29.611 --> 01:28:30.644
DARIN: What?

01:28:30.644 --> 01:28:32.059
TRAVIS: Explosive!

01:28:32.059 --> 01:28:37.018
MATT: They emerge, but they are not in combat yet.
Arby, you're up.

01:28:37.018 --> 01:28:41.542
LAURA: I think we should run away! And I start
running away.

01:28:41.542 --> 01:28:42.686
MATT: Okay.

01:28:42.686 --> 01:28:44.947
LAURA: As I'm running, do I see the little lost
ghoul?

01:28:44.947 --> 01:28:50.290
MATT: I'll say yes. I'll say as you're running
away, it's coming back towards you.

01:28:50.290 --> 01:28:54.011
LAURA: I splat it. I want to try to splat it as
I'm running.

01:28:54.011 --> 01:28:55.742
TRAVIS: I totally heard law school.

01:28:55.742 --> 01:28:59.018
DARIN: I passed the bar.

01:28:59.018 --> 01:29:01.216
LAURA: 26!

01:29:01.216 --> 01:29:02.835
MATT: 26 hits. Roll damage.

01:29:02.835 --> 01:29:08.367
LAURA: 14.

01:29:08.367 --> 01:29:14.222
MATT: All right, so this one ghoul who had made
his journey back finally sees home and is running

01:29:14.222 --> 01:29:24.789
up and sees you (heavy footsteps, impact) and
full-on whack-a-mole him into the dirt.

01:29:24.789 --> 01:29:26.535
LAURA: I keep running.

01:29:26.535 --> 01:29:27.879
MATT: You keep running.

01:29:27.879 --> 01:29:34.462
LAURA: Can I use-- as my bonus action, I'm going
to use my second wind.

01:29:34.462 --> 01:29:40.351
MATT: Go for it. You get to heal up some damage.
All right. Mozuu.

01:29:40.351 --> 01:29:52.027
DARIN: Question: I started, hit-point-wise, at 44.
I'm now at nine. I can perform Lay on Hands and

01:29:52.027 --> 01:29:54.845
heal myself. Does that take time?

01:29:54.845 --> 01:29:56.208
MATT: It's an action.

01:29:56.208 --> 01:30:01.069
DARIN: Yeah. If it's my turn, I'm going to do
that.

01:30:01.069 --> 01:30:07.660
MATT: Okay. You can use as many points as you want
to heal yourself.

01:30:07.660 --> 01:30:14.396
DARIN: So if I spend nine hit points to heal as
many as I can?

01:30:14.396 --> 01:30:19.931
MATT: You have a pool of 25 hit points total, and
you choose a number of that 25. You only have 25

01:30:19.931 --> 01:30:23.089
for the whole day that you can heal with that, but
you can do five or ten or eight.

01:30:23.089 --> 01:30:24.663
DARIN: I'd like to try for ten.

01:30:24.663 --> 01:30:29.728
MATT: Okay, so you use your action to heal ten hit
points. Mark those ten off, and you heal ten.

01:30:29.728 --> 01:30:35.712
DARIN: Great. I'm at 19, minus ten, and then I
will run.

01:30:35.712 --> 01:30:39.759
MATT: Okay. You go running and bolting off. Okay,
so as you guys are all charging, you're still

01:30:39.759 --> 01:30:43.619
hidden against the mound. You see these three
emerge from the side, and they're between you and

01:30:43.619 --> 01:30:45.661
your allies as you're pressed against the mound.

01:30:45.661 --> 01:30:49.281
TRAVIS: (screams) I take off running, too.

01:30:49.281 --> 01:30:53.459
MATT: You go running past one of them. It does get
an attack of opportunity on you as you emerge.

01:30:53.459 --> 01:30:56.580
That's going to hit. That's a 17 plus five.

01:30:56.580 --> 01:30:58.478
TRAVIS: Uncanny dodge!

01:30:58.478 --> 01:31:05.737
MATT: Okay, so that's five points of slashing
damage, which you take half of, so that's two. But

01:31:05.737 --> 01:31:13.112
you go running past? Double charge? Okay. As you
guys are running, they're pretty quick, and

01:31:13.112 --> 01:31:18.020
they're keeping pace with you. They can't quite
catch up to you, but they're following. As you're

01:31:18.020 --> 01:31:21.070
rushing, since you're the furthest behind, make a
perception check.

01:31:21.070 --> 01:31:25.080
TRAVIS: 11.

01:31:25.080 --> 01:31:29.179
MATT: Okay. After a while, you eventually hear the
sound subside, and it seems like they're returning

01:31:29.179 --> 01:31:31.951
to their mound. They don't want to get too far
away from their home base.

01:31:31.951 --> 01:31:35.310
LAURA: They don't want to get lost like some other
little ghouls out there.

01:31:35.310 --> 01:31:43.680
TRAVIS: (wheezes) I think they left us behind. Why
do I sound like this?

01:31:43.680 --> 01:31:46.977
DARIN: They get you in the throat, did they?

01:31:46.977 --> 01:31:48.660
TRAVIS: Yeah. We're clear!

01:31:48.660 --> 01:31:53.863
DARIN: Sorry. Thought you were an imposter.

01:31:53.863 --> 01:31:55.569
TRAVIS: Forgot my inhaler.

01:31:55.569 --> 01:32:09.395
MATT: As the three of you reconvene, you make your
way up the path and see one heavy breathing,

01:32:09.395 --> 01:32:11.880
exhausted Eden, alone.

01:32:11.880 --> 01:32:21.312
SAM: They fought bravely. They were my friends.
They took care of me.

01:32:21.312 --> 01:32:24.547
DARIN: They're standing behind you.

01:32:24.547 --> 01:32:27.060
SAM: Oh! I'm hearing voices again.

01:32:27.060 --> 01:32:29.114
LAURA: It's the dark lord.

01:32:29.114 --> 01:32:31.699
DARIN: Yeah, the dark lord is speaking to you
now.

01:32:31.699 --> 01:32:34.084
LAURA: You should probably pick your nose.

01:32:34.084 --> 01:32:36.319
SAM: Two voices. Oh god.

01:32:36.319 --> 01:32:38.548
TRAVIS: Ur-Eden!

01:32:38.548 --> 01:32:46.701
SAM: Three voices. He speaks in mysterious ways.
Oh, well. I'll end it all right here.

01:32:46.701 --> 01:32:48.731
TRAVIS: Wait!

01:32:48.731 --> 01:32:50.645
DARIN: No, it's us! Turn around.

01:32:50.645 --> 01:32:52.591
SAM: Oh, hi!

01:32:52.591 --> 01:32:56.570
DARIN: Olog-hai, right back at you.

01:32:56.570 --> 01:32:58.440
TRAVIS: You're faster than I thought.

01:32:58.440 --> 01:33:00.202
SAM: Hi. How'd it go?

01:33:00.202 --> 01:33:07.529
LAURA: We killed them. All of them. Every last one
of them.

01:33:07.529 --> 01:33:08.789
TRAVIS: She killed five of them.

01:33:08.789 --> 01:33:10.311
LAURA: I did. Is that how many I killed?

01:33:10.311 --> 01:33:11.181
TRAVIS: Yep.

01:33:11.181 --> 01:33:13.490
SAM: I'm sorry I left, but when he made me leaver--

01:33:13.490 --> 01:33:16.121
DARIN: Leader.

01:33:16.166 --> 01:33:19.733
SAM: Leader? Oh. I thought he said "leaver."

01:33:19.733 --> 01:33:22.847
TRAVIS: Made me leaver?

01:33:22.847 --> 01:33:27.017
SAM: All right, shall we continue eastward?

01:33:27.017 --> 01:33:29.212
LAURA: Okay.

01:33:29.212 --> 01:33:31.710
SAM: Which way is that?

01:33:31.710 --> 01:33:33.918
TRAVIS: Do I know which way is east?

01:33:33.918 --> 01:33:38.721
MATT: Make a nature check, since you guys are a
little scattered, at this point.

01:33:38.721 --> 01:33:45.444
TRAVIS: Nature check. Natural 20. That doesn't
help with directions.

01:33:45.444 --> 01:33:49.611
MATT: You do that for a moment and realize that
doesn't help. However, you glance over and see the

01:33:49.611 --> 01:33:52.873
orange glow of the top of Mount Doom, and that
does help you realize: Ah! That is east.

01:33:52.873 --> 01:33:56.292
TRAVIS: That is east.

01:33:56.292 --> 01:34:00.153
MATT: As you begin to move in that direction, I'll
let you-- since you're leading this charge again,

01:34:00.153 --> 01:34:04.222
with the helmet, make a perception check with
advantage because of the nature check. That 20

01:34:04.222 --> 01:34:05.772
gave you a benefit to this.

01:34:05.772 --> 01:34:07.402
TRAVIS: Perception with advantage, or nature with
advantage?

01:34:07.402 --> 01:34:08.801
MATT: Perception with advantage.

01:34:08.801 --> 01:34:12.049
TRAVIS: That helps. 18.

01:34:12.049 --> 01:34:17.331
MATT: 18. You guys have now crested the highest
point of this mountain range and are now making

01:34:17.331 --> 01:34:22.013
your way down the opposite side of this first
ridge. As you climb over the edge, you glance

01:34:22.013 --> 01:34:24.942
over. Are you still on the shoulders of your
olog-hai friend?

01:34:24.942 --> 01:34:26.597
TRAVIS: Yeah, I climb back up.

01:34:26.597 --> 01:34:32.501
MATT: You glance over the shoulders and look down
just past the shelf, and you see this very faint

01:34:32.501 --> 01:34:38.362
bit of light, tucked in this small outcove in the
side of the mountain. You glance past, and you can

01:34:38.362 --> 01:34:47.703
see six uruk figures, five of which are bundled up
in ramshackle rags, small sleeping bag bundles,

01:34:47.703 --> 01:34:54.393
and one of them has a torch across its shoulder,
keeping watch. They look roughly about the size of

01:34:54.393 --> 01:34:57.333
the goblins that you saw fleeing from the
scene.

01:34:57.333 --> 01:35:08.626
TRAVIS: (shushing) I see figures ahead. Three of
them. Three of them! One on guard with a torch.

01:35:08.626 --> 01:35:10.601
LAURA: Do you think we could take them?

01:35:10.601 --> 01:35:13.913
TRAVIS: Yeah, slit their throats while they're
resting.

01:35:13.913 --> 01:35:19.483
LAURA: Wait, but I'm hurt still from the ghouls.
Will you help me?

01:35:19.483 --> 01:35:23.193
(laughter)

01:35:23.193 --> 01:35:28.351
SAM: I'm pretty hurt, too. And you're hurt, as
well. Should we take another rest?

01:35:28.351 --> 01:35:36.273
LAURA: Can we? Can we rest and watch them while we
rest? Let's sit down for 30 minutes, around, and

01:35:36.273 --> 01:35:40.326
maybe heal a little bit, but then be ready to
attack if they get up.

01:35:40.326 --> 01:35:43.433
TRAVIS: No, we charge in!

01:35:43.433 --> 01:35:45.603
LAURA: No, Skak.

01:35:45.603 --> 01:35:49.081
SAM: I can heal us if you want, and we can keep
going.

01:35:49.081 --> 01:35:50.270
LAURA: Yeah.

01:35:50.270 --> 01:35:58.784
SAM: All right, gather around. I will need to use
all of my healing potential for this. What hurts?

01:35:58.784 --> 01:36:05.175
LAURA: Well, my elbow's been giving me some
problems lately, because I think the maul might be

01:36:05.175 --> 01:36:07.642
a little too-- I may be overextending.

01:36:07.642 --> 01:36:10.455
DARIN: I think we're hurt from the fighting that
we just did.

01:36:10.455 --> 01:36:14.472
LAURA: Oh. Well, a ghoul bit me on my knee, and a
ghoul bit my ankle, and another one got up here

01:36:14.472 --> 01:36:18.784
around the shoulder, but I can't tell if it's from
the scar that Skak gave me.

01:36:18.784 --> 01:36:27.318
SAM: I cake some mud onto all of her wounds and
heal her 13 points.

01:36:27.318 --> 01:36:29.571
LAURA: That's good! I was down 15.

01:36:29.571 --> 01:36:35.893
SAM: Well, where do you hurt? What ails you?

01:36:35.893 --> 01:36:46.203
DARIN: Specifically, everything. I will take
whatever you give, O glorious leader. I bow to

01:36:46.203 --> 01:36:47.908
your healing prowess.

01:36:47.908 --> 01:36:50.772
SAM: I will take my hair--

01:36:50.772 --> 01:36:53.206
LAURA: You have hair?

01:36:53.206 --> 01:37:01.516
SAM: Yes, I have a little bit. I shake off the
dandruff, make it into a tea that he drinks, but

01:37:01.516 --> 01:37:06.540
it's filled with protein.

01:37:06.540 --> 01:37:10.485
MATT: Uruk scalp protein?

01:37:10.485 --> 01:37:12.274
SAM: Yeah. That heals 11 points.

01:37:12.274 --> 01:37:22.699
DARIN: That was the best I've ever had in my life.
I may be chosen, but you? You're good.

01:37:22.699 --> 01:37:25.074
TRAVIS: Dandruff scalp protein?

01:37:25.074 --> 01:37:26.387
LAURA: Gross.

01:37:26.387 --> 01:37:33.319
SAM: I keep a little flask of grog. I'll swig
that. Can I heal myself a bit?

01:37:33.319 --> 01:37:34.788
MATT: Yeah.

01:37:34.788 --> 01:37:39.975
SAM: Oh yeah. 11 points. Back up in it.

01:37:39.975 --> 01:37:43.745
LAURA: Can we run to the restroom?

01:37:43.745 --> 01:37:48.435
MATT: I was actually about to say, as you guys are
taking this moment to heal yourselves up and

01:37:48.435 --> 01:37:54.615
prepare yourselves for whatever point of entry to
this apparently unaware group of sleeping uruk

01:37:54.615 --> 01:38:00.516
traitors are, we're going to take a break. We'll
rest up here for a minute. We'll be back here for

01:38:00.516 --> 01:38:06.406
the second half, very soon, of our journey deeper
into the dark depths of Mordor.

01:38:06.406 --> 01:38:07.604
TRAVIS: The Forcs!

01:38:07.604 --> 01:38:10.043
ALL: The Forcs!

01:38:10.043 --> 01:38:14.105
MATT: Thank you again WB Games for this. We'll
come back here with the second half real soon.

01:38:14.105 --> 01:38:17.922
LAURA: This is so much fun!

01:38:17.922 --> 01:38:21.097
MATT: You guys are awesome!

01:38:21.097 --> 01:38:26.875
