00:00:00.689 --> 00:00:03.548
MATT: Welcome to tonight's episode of Critical
Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors

00:00:03.548 --> 00:00:06.759
sit around and play Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons. Nice try,
motherfuckers.

00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:10.307
(all laugh)

00:00:10.307 --> 00:00:14.133
MATT: Anyway, welcome to tonight's episode. Before
we get into it, we have some announcements to do

00:00:14.133 --> 00:00:19.713
really fast. First and foremost, getting to our
fantastic sponsor for the evening. Returning: the

00:00:19.713 --> 00:00:27.891
glorious Loot Crate! Thank you so much, Loot
Crate, for being fantastic and for being a sponsor

00:00:27.891 --> 00:00:30.572
for our show as long as you have! It's been awesome!

00:00:30.572 --> 00:00:32.096
SAM: Hi, guys!

00:00:32.153 --> 00:00:33.039
MATT: Hi, Sam.

00:00:33.039 --> 00:00:34.242
SAM: Oh, you didn't throw it to me yet, did you?

00:00:34.242 --> 00:00:36.042
MATT: No, but I can. Hey, Sam. Why don't you tell
us about our sponsor?

00:00:36.042 --> 00:00:41.283
SAM: Hey, as I tell you guys-- Hey, crew. By the way, crew:
as I tell you guys about Loot Crate, can you guys

00:00:41.352 --> 00:00:48.605
get a camera up here? I'm going to show some
close-up things. Should have done that ahead of

00:00:48.605 --> 00:00:55.594
time. It's on its way. Okay. Loot Crate, the theme
this week is Primal. Brands include X-Men,

00:00:55.594 --> 00:00:59.808
Overwatch, Predator, you can go to
lootcrate.com/criticalrole and use the promo code

00:00:59.808 --> 00:01:06.139
CRITICALROLE for 10% off. And that's some severe
savings. Just a few days left to catch this

00:01:06.139 --> 00:01:11.676
month's theme, so check it out. They're a great
sponsor; we love them. They do so much for the

00:01:11.676 --> 00:01:16.922
show. We genuinely appreciate them. Okay, that
being said-- and this will tie into Loot Crate, I

00:01:16.922 --> 00:01:26.455
promise-- I was thinking a lot this week about fan
art. Are you on me? Whatever. Fan art.

00:01:26.455 --> 00:01:28.133
MARISHA: Where did that camera come from?

00:01:28.133 --> 00:01:33.862
SAM: They're fast. So, we have amazing fan artists
on this show. We get hundreds of art pieces every

00:01:33.862 --> 00:01:39.111
week. We're floored by them constantly:
legitimately amazing artists. Talented, gifted.

00:01:39.111 --> 00:01:44.209
And I was like, "why should they get all the fun?"
So I was like, "I'm going to do my own fan art

00:01:44.209 --> 00:01:51.994
"this week!" Because things people know about me,
I'm a talented performer and all that stuff, but

00:01:52.055 --> 00:01:58.600
I'm also an emerging visual artist. And this is a
chance to get my art out to the world. And so I'm

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:06.041
going to present it right now. Guys, this is art,
so if you have any kind of a reaction that's real-- if

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:08.151
you cry, if you clap, whatever. I'll take it.

00:02:08.151 --> 00:02:10.111
LIAM: Man. Joma, your time is over!

00:02:11.442 --> 00:02:17.249
SAM: I'm going to start with Grog.

00:02:17.249 --> 00:02:18.378
LAURA: So good!

00:02:18.378 --> 00:02:19.374
SAM: It's pretty good!

00:02:19.374 --> 00:02:20.645
LAURA: Did you really draw that?

00:02:20.645 --> 00:02:22.507
MARISHA: Let me see over here! Is that you? Did
you do that?

00:02:22.576 --> 00:02:23.680
SAM: Magic marker on paper.

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:24.686
MARISHA: That's actually pretty good, man!

00:02:24.686 --> 00:02:25.644
LAURA: I like it!

00:02:25.644 --> 00:02:27.812
SAM: I feel like I got his rage and his ferocity.

00:02:27.812 --> 00:02:30.129
TALIESIN: I'm feeling it.

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:32.927
SAM: Next up, she's hard: Keyleth.

00:02:32.927 --> 00:02:34.175
MARISHA: That's pretty good!

00:02:34.175 --> 00:02:40.359
SAM: I did Keyleth. I should point out that all of
these are signed and numbered by the artist.

00:02:40.735 --> 00:02:42.779
MARISHA: I have some fierce bone structure going.

00:02:42.779 --> 00:02:45.366
SAM: You're hard. Lot of things going on.

00:02:45.366 --> 00:02:49.970
MATT: I can see she's cast the 5th-level spell
"Body to Forest."

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:55.867
SAM: I didn't know how to draw bodies! So I just
went with grass!

00:02:55.937 --> 00:02:57.628
LIAM: Druids don't shave pits, man.

00:02:57.628 --> 00:03:05.241
SAM: Truth be told, I was drinking, so things get
a little worse as we go. So, this is Percy! It's a

00:03:05.295 --> 00:03:10.114
lot of white. I don't know how to paint with white
or use white.

00:03:10.114 --> 00:03:11.907
LIAM: To be fair, so is Percy.

00:03:11.907 --> 00:03:20.736
SAM: He's a white guy with white hair. I've got to
work on this one. Next up, a guy who's near and

00:03:20.736 --> 00:03:28.237
dear to me. Here's Taryon Darrington. Little art
tip here, guys: don't use blue pencil on blue

00:03:28.237 --> 00:03:35.187
paper because it tends not to show up. That's a
free artist-to-artist tip for you guys.

00:03:35.187 --> 00:03:39.432
TALIESIN: Wait, you need to turn it back this way
more. Oh, okay.

00:03:39.432 --> 00:03:41.585
SAM: There is a drawing there.

00:03:41.585 --> 00:03:42.683
TALIESIN: Bold decisions.

00:03:42.683 --> 00:03:44.373
SAM: It's just blue pencil on blue paper.

00:03:44.373 --> 00:03:46.795
MATT: It's like one of the Magic Eye pictures. You
have to really focus to see it.

00:03:46.795 --> 00:03:48.185
TALIESIN: I see a sailboat.

00:03:48.185 --> 00:03:53.474
SAM: And then I was like, "The people are going to
want Scanlan, right?" So this one took the most

00:03:53.474 --> 00:04:01.236
time. I will say this. Took about an hour. Mostly
because I had to go to CVS to get more magic

00:04:01.236 --> 00:04:07.828
markers, so that was about 55 minutes of the time.
And then the rest was hardcore art. And I feel

00:04:07.828 --> 00:04:11.078
like I really captured him. He's got a flute. He's
got poop.

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:16.104
MARISHA: I love that you broke rule number one of
Pictionary and labeled things!

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:20.242
SAM: Okay, I'm going to do the twins next.
Probably go a little wider because these will be

00:04:20.242 --> 00:04:26.324
side-by-side, all right? So you can really get the
artistry. Okay, here they are.

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:27.821
LAURA: Which one's which?

00:04:27.821 --> 00:04:29.848
(all laugh)

00:04:29.848 --> 00:04:36.367
SAM: Some may argue that I photocopied Vax and put
pink ribbons in her hair to be Vex. Some could

00:04:36.367 --> 00:04:44.086
argue that, and they would be correct. But you can
also tell them apart because he's got a knife and

00:04:44.086 --> 00:04:46.749
she's got a little bow and arrow.

00:04:46.749 --> 00:04:48.635
TRAVIS: Are those arrows green?

00:04:48.635 --> 00:04:54.372
SAM: I ran out of a lot of things, and I was
drinking pretty heavily at this point, so I was

00:04:54.548 --> 00:05:00.350
probably fully drunk at this point. And then last,
but not least. I mean, all together, I'd say

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:08.645
probably an hour and a half it took me to do all
these, including the CVS run. And last but not

00:05:08.645 --> 00:05:12.793
least, I'm most proud of Pike Trickfoot, ladies
and gentlemen.

00:05:12.793 --> 00:05:16.140
ALL: Whoa!

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:21.917
SAM: Now, again, you could say that I printed out
her IMDB page and colored it in, and you'd be

00:05:21.917 --> 00:05:27.409
right, but it is also art, and I will stick by
that. Now here's how this all ties into Loot

00:05:27.409 --> 00:05:29.200
Crate, guys.

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:31.387
MATT: It tied into The Dark Knight in that
particular image.

00:05:31.387 --> 00:05:37.249
SAM: I'm giving all of this art away tonight! I'm
doing a contest, an unsanctioned contest that I'm

00:05:37.474 --> 00:05:43.248
running myself. So tonight, tweet me pictures of
your Loot Crate stuff, like you and your Loot

00:05:43.248 --> 00:05:50.830
Crate shirt, or you holding a Loot Crate, or a
screengrab of "I just subscribed to Loot Crate!"

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:54.687
Tweet it to me with the hashtag
#BrianFosterSmellsLikeCabbage.

00:05:54.687 --> 00:05:56.566
(all laugh)

00:05:56.566 --> 00:06:02.644
SAM: And I will, like a lottery, pick one at
random to win all of this art signed by the

00:06:02.644 --> 00:06:10.473
artist. One-of-a-kind pieces that will certainly
go up in value-- maybe even before I die! They

00:06:10.473 --> 00:06:16.111
will be worth a lot of money. And these are all
going to a fabulous art collector out there. Thank

00:06:16.111 --> 00:06:19.959
you, Loot Crate! Thank you, artists! And that's
it.

00:06:19.959 --> 00:06:22.201
TALIESIN: What are you?

00:06:22.747 --> 00:06:27.820
LIAM: Happy St. Pat's. That's the end of the episode, right?

00:06:28.548 --> 00:06:31.382
SAM: You can pass them around. Share them, show
them.

00:06:31.382 --> 00:06:33.715
MARISHA: When did you do these? Last night?

00:06:33.715 --> 00:06:35.820
SAM: I think it was after you left my house last
night.

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:39.078
MARISHA: Are you serious? We left at midnight!

00:06:39.078 --> 00:06:41.146
SAM: Yeah, it was eleven-something.

00:06:41.146 --> 00:06:45.201
TALIESIN: Is it my imagination that all of the
half-elves kind of have the same

00:06:45.257 --> 00:06:47.692
weird chin thing going on?

00:06:47.747 --> 00:06:49.046
MATT: It's consistent!

00:06:49.046 --> 00:06:50.047
SAM: Yeah!

00:06:50.047 --> 00:06:54.901
TALIESIN: I will also say that I definitely get
Ashley as the Joker threatening the city.

00:06:54.901 --> 00:06:56.151
SAM and MATT: Yeah.

00:06:56.151 --> 00:06:58.141
TALIESIN: Millions will die.

00:06:58.141 --> 00:07:00.195
MARISHA: Why the pink lipstick, man?

00:07:00.195 --> 00:07:01.190
SAM: That's what girls wear!

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:03.247
MARISHA: Have you ever seen Ashley wear pink
lipstick?

00:07:03.247 --> 00:07:04.791
SAM: Yep. Girls wear pink lipstick.

00:07:04.791 --> 00:07:07.157
MARISHA: Although I appreciate her guns and her
biceps.

00:07:07.157 --> 00:07:08.412
MATT: She's a monstah.

00:07:08.412 --> 00:07:10.716
TALIESIN: She's like if The Joker had a daughter
with Krondor.

00:07:10.716 --> 00:07:11.967
MATT: Thank you, Sam.

00:07:11.967 --> 00:07:12.837
SAM: Sure, sure.

00:07:12.837 --> 00:07:13.948
LAURA: Thank you, Sam, and thank you, Loot Crate!

00:07:13.948 --> 00:07:15.111
MATT: Thank you, Loot Crate.

00:07:15.111 --> 00:07:16.564
TALIESIN: What's that hashtag again?

00:07:16.564 --> 00:07:18.631
SAM: #BrianFosterSmellsLikeCabbage

00:07:18.631 --> 00:07:23.482
MATT: Okay, there we go. Remember that, guys. All
right, merch update. Same old, same old,

00:07:23.482 --> 00:07:24.466
I'm pretty sure?

00:07:24.466 --> 00:07:26.582
LAURA: Merch update! There's merch still in the
store!

00:07:26.582 --> 00:07:29.737
MATT: Cool. You've got stickers, mugs, patches,
bracelets, stuff like that.

00:07:29.737 --> 00:07:31.222
LAURA: All that stuff.

00:07:31.222 --> 00:07:35.149
MATT: Logo shirts and the disturbingly comfortable
"How do you want to do this?" hoodies up there.

00:07:35.149 --> 00:07:36.398
LAURA: It's true.

00:07:36.398 --> 00:07:42.549
MATT: WonderCon! We're going to be at WonderCon
doing a live Talks Machina panel on Saturday,

00:07:42.549 --> 00:07:51.432
April 1st from 2-3 PM Pacific at the arena at the
Anaheim Convention Center. The big room. So fill

00:07:51.432 --> 00:07:54.809
it, Critters! Come on in! We have plenty of room
and space for you guys. We want to try to show the

00:07:54.832 --> 00:07:55.895
convention that we are legion.

00:07:55.971 --> 00:07:57.579
MARISHA: Not an April Fools' joke!

00:07:57.579 --> 00:07:59.079
MATT: We're actually going to be there.

00:07:59.079 --> 00:08:00.296
LAURA: This is legit.

00:08:00.296 --> 00:08:02.516
LIAM: It is an April Fools' joke.

00:08:02.516 --> 00:08:03.839
LAURA: No, it's not!

00:08:03.902 --> 00:08:06.255
MATT: They gave us the big room and went, "You
can't fill this," and we're like, "Yeah, we can."

00:08:06.255 --> 00:08:10.203
So we're trying to prove to them that we can fill
the room. Come and join us, 2-3 PM.

00:08:10.203 --> 00:08:12.786
LIAM: Bring 4,000 of your closest friends.

00:08:16.303 --> 00:08:17.807
MATT: Wednesday Club! Taliesin!

00:08:17.807 --> 00:08:22.260
TALIESIN: Yes! I missed this week because I
realized, once again, that I'm supposed to be

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:27.074
doing things other than playing D&amp;amp;D and actually
working in the real world. So I missed this

00:08:27.074 --> 00:08:30.853
Wednesday Club, but I'll be back next week. I
don't actually know what the subject is yet

00:08:30.853 --> 00:08:32.859
because I've done nothing other than this all
week.

00:08:32.859 --> 00:08:34.230
SAM: Fantastic Four!

00:08:34.230 --> 00:08:36.864
TALIESIN: Actually, probably not. We did Marvel
last week.

00:08:36.864 --> 00:08:38.123
TRAVIS: Old Man Logan!

00:08:38.123 --> 00:08:41.564
TALIESIN: Maybe. No Marvel this week! We've got to
let DC, and Image, and independent books

00:08:41.564 --> 00:08:42.842
may give a thing.

00:08:42.842 --> 00:08:44.613
TRAVIS: X-O Manowar!

00:08:44.613 --> 00:08:48.799
TALIESIN: X-O Manowar? You are a nerd, dude, whoa!
Are you coming on?

00:08:48.799 --> 00:08:50.931
MATT: How about just Manowar? The band.

00:08:50.931 --> 00:08:53.363
TALIESIN: I was going to say, will you come on our
X-O Manowar show if we do one?

00:08:53.363 --> 00:08:54.798
TRAVIS: I don't know, man. I like football.

00:08:54.798 --> 00:09:00.761
TALIESIN: Okay. I love you. So yeah, there will be
a Wednesday Club. Check out Twitter for updates,

00:09:00.761 --> 00:09:05.212
but I'll be back and it will be fun, and I'll be
catching up on all my books.

00:09:07.671 --> 00:09:18.343
MATT: Awesome. Next up, we have debuting on, I
believe it's Sunday. This Sunday, March 19th, on

00:09:18.343 --> 00:09:24.720
Alpha we have Roundtable. Which is, essentially, a
series where a bunch of various storytellers get

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:29.956
together and talk about different themes about
storytelling over drinks. It's actually pretty

00:09:29.956 --> 00:09:35.890
badass. This first season is Gamemasters. We have
a collection of talented people from all over the

00:09:35.890 --> 00:09:38.863
webisphere running games.

00:09:39.036 --> 00:09:40.665
MARISHA: We went international!

00:09:40.665 --> 00:09:44.398
MATT: Heck yeah. This first episode premieres
Sunday. It's a conversation between me, Mark Humes

00:09:44.398 --> 00:09:50.672
of High Rollers, and Adam Koebel of Roll Play. So,
if you want to check it out, it's on

00:09:50.672 --> 00:09:53.070
projectalpha.com.

00:09:53.070 --> 00:09:54.715
MARISHA: Pro-JECT Alpha.

00:09:54.715 --> 00:09:56.018
MATT: Pro-JECT Alpha.

00:09:56.018 --> 00:09:58.044
MARISHA: Pro-JECT that Alpha.

00:09:58.044 --> 00:10:02.899
MATT: It actually was a really awesome
conversation. I'm pretty happy about it. We got a

00:10:02.899 --> 00:10:10.092
little tipsy. GM Tips episode went up today! It is
my final run on GM Tips, but the series continues

00:10:10.267 --> 00:10:15.119
as I pass it off to a new host. If you haven't
checked it out yet, our fantastic Satine Phoenix

00:10:15.119 --> 00:10:21.373
is picking up the torch to give her perspective as
a game master for this next bit. She's awesome.

00:10:21.373 --> 00:10:28.538
This episode is specifically about how to avoid or
deal with GM burnout, which is a topic that I

00:10:28.538 --> 00:10:30.737
think a lot of people are familiar with.

00:10:30.737 --> 00:10:32.331
LIAM: You don't have that, do you?

00:10:32.331 --> 00:10:33.635
MATT: Huh? Not yet.

00:10:33.705 --> 00:10:35.513
TRAVIS: They make pharmaceuticals for that.

00:10:35.513 --> 00:10:39.667
MATT: None. (laughs) Hopefully. No, but honestly,
it's got some good tips for anyone out there who

00:10:39.667 --> 00:10:43.303
is feeling like they're starting to run a little
ragged or a little sluggish. Check it out. Hope

00:10:43.303 --> 00:10:46.988
you like it. Signal Boost
episode.

00:10:47.059 --> 00:10:54.489
MARISHA: Featuring Satine! Which we timed out
pretty well. I think intentionally.

00:10:54.489 --> 00:10:56.203
TALIESIN: Maybe. Probably not.

00:10:56.203 --> 00:10:57.466
MARISHA: I'm not sure.

00:10:57.466 --> 00:10:59.082
MATT: Nothing that works out well is intentional
in our sphere.

00:10:59.082 --> 00:11:03.289
MARISHA: Totally intentionally. So if you don't
know who Satine is, get introduced to her with

00:11:03.289 --> 00:11:09.135
this week's episode of Signal Boost, and then
she'll lead you graciously into GM Tips.

00:11:09.135 --> 00:11:12.976
TALIESIN: It's the gothiest one since me, I think.
Well, no, Jason Charles is pretty gothy.

00:11:13.049 --> 00:11:17.194
MARISHA: She's awesome. I have kind of a girl
crush on Satine. She's so cool.

00:11:17.194 --> 00:11:18.356
TALIESIN: She's so cool.

00:11:18.356 --> 00:11:21.216
MARISHA: Yeah, you should go watch her.

00:11:22.469 --> 00:11:23.599
LAURA: Thanks, Matthew Mercer!

00:11:23.599 --> 00:11:25.319
MATT: You're welcome. Updated Trinket stats.

00:11:25.319 --> 00:11:28.397
LAURA: (singsong) New Trinket stats!

00:11:28.397 --> 00:11:33.648
LIAM: He's got guns attached now! Gatling gun!

00:11:34.937 --> 00:11:37.001
LAURA: Yep, and a cannon.

00:11:37.001 --> 00:11:37.911
MATT: Misfire score: 20.

00:11:37.911 --> 00:11:39.025
LIAM: It shoots bees!

00:11:39.025 --> 00:11:40.900
MATT: Yeah, and they all attack Trinket. It's bad.
You don't want to use it.

00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:43.060
(all laugh)

00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:48.934
MATT: (explosion noise) Right back into him. (bear
grunting) Yes, and last but not least, Talks

00:11:48.934 --> 00:11:54.316
Machina live on Tuesdays, 7 PM, here on Twitch and
Alpha. Brian Foster hosts every week. We talk

00:11:54.316 --> 00:11:57.998
about random shit about this, have guests from the
community on-- check it out. It's a good time.

00:11:57.998 --> 00:11:59.391
MARISHA: And apparently he smells like cabbage.

00:11:59.391 --> 00:12:00.565
MATT: Apparently, hashtag.

00:12:00.565 --> 00:12:04.313
SAM: Getting a lot of great tweets already.

00:12:04.791 --> 00:12:07.900
MATT: All right! That's the last of my
announcements.

00:12:08.877 --> 00:12:10.788
SAM: Are we doing the other thing?

00:12:10.788 --> 00:12:14.291
MATT: Oh, that's right! I'm sorry! The Critical
Role Fan Club on Facebook actually had a limerick

00:12:14.291 --> 00:12:24.722
contest to announce their 10,000th person joining
it. And we had a winner. The winner is Tamiko L.

00:12:24.722 --> 00:12:27.822
Fujio. Sam, do you have a copy of the limerick?

00:12:27.822 --> 00:12:29.753
SAM: I have a copy of the limerick in my inbox,
right here.

00:12:29.753 --> 00:12:31.316
MATT: I think you should read it off.

00:12:31.316 --> 00:12:35.042
SAM: I'm going to read this limerick. They had
their own internal contest, and this was the

00:12:35.042 --> 00:12:37.437
winner, and it's really awesome.

00:12:37.437 --> 00:12:41.874
Vox Machina is a fine troupe 
Who knock baddies and grannies for a loop

00:12:41.874 --> 00:12:46.560
Unless they encounter a door 
Then their plans are no more

00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:49.406
So instead they'll just scry with their poop.

00:12:49.406 --> 00:12:52.528
(all cheer and laugh)

00:12:52.528 --> 00:13:02.534
MATT: Congratulations, Tamiko. That was awesome!
Well done. And everyone leveled. Everyone's at 17

00:13:02.534 --> 00:13:05.073
except for Tary, who's at 14. Congratulations.

00:13:05.073 --> 00:13:07.267
TRAVIS: Fucking dingleberry.

00:13:08.052 --> 00:13:09.762
MARISHA: (sings) 9th-level spells!

00:13:09.762 --> 00:13:11.576
LAURA: That Scanlan could've gotten.

00:13:11.576 --> 00:13:12.516
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:13:12.516 --> 00:13:14.504
(all laugh)

00:13:14.504 --> 00:13:18.965
MATT: Anyway, let's go ahead and bring it into
tonight's episode of Critical Role.

00:13:18.965 --> 00:14:51.498
[opening credits]

00:14:51.553 --> 00:14:59.166
MATT: Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen. I'll
remember that. Taryon apparently exploded.

00:14:59.166 --> 00:15:00.941
TALIESIN: Yeah, that happened.

00:15:00.941 --> 00:15:05.256
MATT: Oh! There he is! Good job! (laughs) It's
like you rushed here from work.

00:15:05.256 --> 00:15:06.239
SAM: (whispers) Sorry!

00:15:06.239 --> 00:15:11.173
MATT: That's okay. So. Bringing us into tonight's
episode: Vox Machina, having completed the

00:15:11.173 --> 00:15:16.673
toppling and destruction of the Chroma Conclave,
have now gone towards tying up the loose ends at

00:15:16.673 --> 00:15:22.784
the end of this massive journey that involved
coming to the final stage of Keyleth's Aramente to

00:15:22.856 --> 00:15:30.263
prove to her people, the Ashari, that she is the
proper next leader of the Zephra Air Ashari.

00:15:30.263 --> 00:15:36.062
You traveled far west across the Ozmit Sea after
renting passage across a ship helmed by Captain

00:15:36.062 --> 00:15:42.736
Adela, and made your way to the island city of
Vesrah, where you encountered Uvenda, Heart of the

00:15:42.736 --> 00:15:46.495
Tides, the leader of the Water Ashari, and put
upon your final trial. You were sent into the

00:15:46.495 --> 00:15:56.907
subocean Aerie of Torrent where you were to
retrieve lodestones in the constant threat of a

00:15:56.907 --> 00:16:01.587
kraken in the vicinity. Unfortunately, the kraken
was triggered upon your attempt. A massive battle

00:16:01.587 --> 00:16:07.143
took place, one that claimed the life of
Vax'ildan, and barely escaped with a success under

00:16:07.143 --> 00:16:12.335
your belt. You managed to bring his body back to
the central temple at the top of Vesrah, and

00:16:12.335 --> 00:16:17.910
through bringing Pike's essence by a blessing
through Sarenrae, complete a resurrection ritual

00:16:17.910 --> 00:16:26.955
that succeeded. Vax returns on his ever-dwindling
borrowed time from the Raven Queen, it seems,

00:16:26.955 --> 00:16:35.806
thrusting himself into danger, but returns
nonetheless. After this, you guys got some

00:16:35.867 --> 00:16:47.252
pictures drawn by Doty, as Pike intimidated him
into learning your names in a wonderful method.

00:16:47.252 --> 00:16:54.972
You got passage on the ship back to Emon, where
you have made your way back to Greyskull Keep. And

00:16:54.972 --> 00:17:00.688
that was where we left off, as you plan for the
next leg of your venture.

00:17:00.688 --> 00:17:14.080
So. Picking up from there: as an evening rest
comes to you all, a night of sleep. Vax, you have

00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:24.585
a difficult evening, tossing and turning in bed,
the general ramifications of recent events

00:17:24.585 --> 00:17:29.319
surrounding you. Which, as a note, as a person
who's back from resurrection, you are at a

00:17:29.319 --> 00:17:35.808
relative penalty for the next few days. I don't
know if you were aware of that.

00:17:35.808 --> 00:17:36.816
Were you aware of that?

00:17:36.816 --> 00:17:38.115
TRAVIS: He is now.

00:17:38.115 --> 00:17:40.149
LIAM: I kind of remember people going through
that.

00:17:40.149 --> 00:17:45.435
MATT: Yep, so you have a night's rest after this,
so that's-- actually, no. You traveled on a boat

00:17:45.435 --> 00:17:49.043
for a few days. That would have gone away! That's
right, because you had to make a whole journey

00:17:49.043 --> 00:17:51.823
back to Emon, so you've rested up heavily in the
boat. Forget I said anything.

00:17:55.419 --> 00:18:01.310
MATT: But, tossing and turning as the night
eventually takes you into subconsciousness, you

00:18:01.551 --> 00:18:11.804
are plagued with flashes of deep-sea darkness.
Lashing tendrils. The ever-gaping maw, a beak

00:18:11.856 --> 00:18:21.432
swallowing you. The light fading. And there once
again, you see emerging from the darkness the same

00:18:21.432 --> 00:18:29.389
expressionless, solid porcelain mask of the Raven
Queen. The voice, omnipresent but gentle,

00:18:29.389 --> 00:18:39.153
strangely warming against the cold of nothing. And
the voice just calls out, "I've given you back, my

00:18:39.153 --> 00:18:49.796
"champion. But you are still mine. You have a
purpose. Do not forget."

00:18:54.387 --> 00:19:12.289
LIAM: You know well that my heart lies with them.
Both of them. All of them. But I have put my faith

00:19:12.289 --> 00:19:20.348
in you. And I await your word.

00:19:22.743 --> 00:19:47.102
MATT: "And wait you shall. I sense something on
the horizon. I sense rousing villainy. I sense

00:19:47.162 --> 00:19:59.057
"twisting the threads of life, but it is too far
beyond my vision. Only time will tell. But I've

00:19:59.057 --> 00:20:08.554
"watched your thread. And it leads to something
bright; it leads to something great. But your

00:20:08.554 --> 00:20:15.521
"thread is still clouded at that point. I cannot
see beyond. And as that thread moves, it gathers

00:20:15.521 --> 00:20:28.863
"many around it: those you've come to love. Perhaps
their fate is tied with yours. Is that a

00:20:28.863 --> 00:20:46.242
"responsibility you can bear, Vax'ildan? Then be
patient. Enjoy the time you have. For when this

00:20:46.242 --> 00:20:57.580
"rousing evil gathers, I will need your full
attention, my champion." The mask recedes back

00:20:57.580 --> 00:21:05.404
into the darkness, the cold overtakes you, and
suddenly you find yourself shooting up in bed,

00:21:05.404 --> 00:21:10.026
gasping for breath. Sweat pours down your face
just as a gentle bit of light begins to break over

00:21:10.026 --> 00:21:12.337
the sun coming through the window into the
bedroom.

00:21:12.337 --> 00:21:17.609
Keyleth, you are roused out of your slumber as
well, hearing him gasp and breathe heavily,

00:21:17.609 --> 00:21:20.056
leaning off the side of the bed.

00:21:22.952 --> 00:21:26.665
MARISHA: You okay?

00:21:28.717 --> 00:21:32.199
LIAM: Yeah. (coughs)

00:21:32.199 --> 00:21:35.665
MARISHA: Did you have a nightmare?

00:21:36.836 --> 00:21:38.142
LIAM: Yeah.

00:21:39.130 --> 00:21:42.801
MARISHA: I have them, too.

00:21:43.051 --> 00:21:45.164
LIAM: I know.

00:21:46.733 --> 00:21:48.907
MARISHA: Do you want to talk about it?

00:21:52.533 --> 00:21:54.463
LIAM: Eventually.

00:21:54.463 --> 00:22:00.791
MARISHA: Okay. Do you need anything?

00:22:03.302 --> 00:22:06.184
LIAM: I've everything I need.

00:22:09.914 --> 00:22:16.637
MARISHA: I do a little bit of Druidcraft,
something like lightning bugs in the room, and

00:22:16.637 --> 00:22:24.219
make them dance. Nice and calming, just trying to
get back to sleep.

00:22:24.219 --> 00:22:26.388
MATT: Okay. You get--

00:22:26.388 --> 00:22:29.903
LIAM: We get an extra hour.

00:22:30.433 --> 00:22:33.996
MATT: You guys curl up to get back to sleep, and
as you do and the darkness takes you once more,

00:22:34.057 --> 00:22:39.544
you hear the faint echoing whisper in the back of
your head as you fall back into your dreams, and

00:22:39.544 --> 00:22:43.053
it says, "My fate-touched."

00:22:46.748 --> 00:22:50.743
Now, the rest of you wake up the next morning.
It's been a while since you've been back in

00:22:50.743 --> 00:22:57.932
Greyskull Keep, and it is strangely heartening to
be back at home without another constant threat of

00:22:57.932 --> 00:23:04.868
death, without the looming of dragon destruction.
And it brings back a flood of memories of when you

00:23:04.868 --> 00:23:12.285
first had this keep made, the innocence of those
days and the things you've learned since, and the

00:23:12.285 --> 00:23:17.653
new appreciations you've gained through the struggles
you've had in the process. The other thing catches

00:23:17.707 --> 00:23:20.513
you is the smell of fresh breakfast being
made downstairs,

00:23:20.555 --> 00:23:22.796
as Laina apparently is already on task.

00:23:22.796 --> 00:23:24.170
TRAVIS: Fuck yeah.

00:23:24.352 --> 00:23:27.005
(all laugh)

00:23:30.244 --> 00:23:33.655
LAURA: I'll run downstairs. Can't miss that.

00:23:34.841 --> 00:23:40.279
MARISHA: As I wake up, before we head downstairs,
I grab Vax. Did you get back to sleep?

00:23:40.279 --> 00:23:41.864
Are you all right?

00:23:41.864 --> 00:23:46.147
LIAM: Yes. You ready for the day?

00:23:48.421 --> 00:23:52.962
MARISHA: Never? Always. Yeah. No. Sure, let's go!

00:23:52.962 --> 00:23:54.508
LIAM: You're a born leader. Come on.

00:23:54.508 --> 00:23:55.596
MARISHA: Thanks.

00:23:57.220 --> 00:24:01.602
MATT: You guys come down for breakfast. Laina is
currently rushing around, seemingly excited at the

00:24:01.602 --> 00:24:09.750
prospect of being back in her kitchen, which has
been outfitted partially. When she returned, as

00:24:09.805 --> 00:24:12.420
you know, most everything was stolen from the
keep, and it looks like she's made a few trips

00:24:12.420 --> 00:24:19.396
into town and has purchased enough to make it
functional. She comes out and she starts bringing

00:24:19.461 --> 00:24:28.009
meals; she has large piles of plates. "I'm really
quite sorry, but we don't have enough plates for

00:24:28.185 --> 00:24:32.120
"everyone, so if you don't mind sharing for now--
We'll go do some purchases."

00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:33.851
LAURA: I start grabbing bacon from the big piles.

00:24:33.851 --> 00:24:37.418
MARISHA: Yeah, same. Communal style.

00:24:37.418 --> 00:24:39.453
MATT: "Good. Well, I hope it's okay."

00:24:39.453 --> 00:24:40.633
LAURA: It's perfect.

00:24:40.633 --> 00:24:42.859
TALIESIN: Oh, good. Plates. I'll have a plate.

00:24:42.859 --> 00:24:45.456
SAM: I'll take one as well.

00:24:47.023 --> 00:24:49.913
LIAM: I reach in front of the boys and grab a big
fistful.

00:24:50.387 --> 00:24:53.994
MARISHA: Half-elves are just, (gnawing noises).

00:24:54.241 --> 00:25:11.238
MATT: As you guys are eating you hear some heavy
footfalls coming from around the corner. The first

00:25:11.238 --> 00:25:20.589
thing you notice is a familiar female face.
Once-short red hair has now grown quite long, or

00:25:20.589 --> 00:25:27.534
at least grown longer to about ear-, chin-length.
You see Shayne Tranter, one of the guards that you

00:25:27.596 --> 00:25:34.851
originally hired and then moved over to Whitestone
to guard, walk in, leather armor on, big pack over

00:25:34.851 --> 00:25:39.058
her shoulder, looks like she's also returned. As she
comes in, she throws her pack down--

00:25:39.131 --> 00:25:40.460
MARISHA: Dwarf, right?

00:25:40.460 --> 00:25:42.404
MATT: Human. Human female.

00:25:42.404 --> 00:25:44.656
MARISHA: Wrong note. Shayne Tranter?

00:25:44.656 --> 00:25:54.793
MATT: Shayne Tranter, yeah. She walks in and
throws her pack down. "Ah, good morning! Glad to

00:25:54.793 --> 00:25:59.084
"see you're all mostly alive."

00:25:59.084 --> 00:26:00.681
TRAVIS: Did you eat already?

00:26:00.681 --> 00:26:01.643
MATT: "No, is there food?"

00:26:01.643 --> 00:26:03.445
TRAVIS: Too bad, no.

00:26:03.445 --> 00:26:04.671
LAURA: Help yourself.

00:26:04.671 --> 00:26:06.304
TALIESIN: Grog, please, there is food.

00:26:06.304 --> 00:26:07.522
SAM: But no plates.

00:26:07.522 --> 00:26:09.418
TALIESIN: But no plates.

00:26:09.418 --> 00:26:10.906
MATT: "And you are?"

00:26:10.906 --> 00:26:17.424
SAM: Oh, hi there! Just here for a visit. Taryon
Darrington. You haven't heard of me yet, but you

00:26:17.424 --> 00:26:22.095
will. Do you work here? Are you one of our
employees?

00:26:23.356 --> 00:26:25.317
MATT: "I'm one of their employees, yes."

00:26:25.317 --> 00:26:28.787
SAM: Oh, well. They made me an official member
now, so.

00:26:28.787 --> 00:26:30.575
MATT: "Great, so you'll be the one that pays me,
then."

00:26:30.575 --> 00:26:31.829
LAURA: Oh!

00:26:31.829 --> 00:26:39.001
SAM: We will all chip in for whatever your monthly
wages will be.

00:26:39.001 --> 00:26:47.096
MATT: "Unless I'm mistaken, and-- well, unless you
canceled our contract. Mind you, we haven't been

00:26:47.096 --> 00:26:49.833
"guarding the keep for a long time, so I'm not
going charge you for the time over that, we

00:26:49.905 --> 00:26:52.554
"appreciate you on that, but we are back on the
clock,

00:26:52.554 --> 00:26:55.312
"and this is kind of my only job at the 
moment, so--"

00:26:55.312 --> 00:26:57.724
LAURA: Start guarding.

00:26:57.724 --> 00:27:01.235
MATT: "All right." And she smiles and sits down,
and she grabs a little bit of food and pulls it

00:27:01.235 --> 00:27:06.297
off into her hand and starts eating off her
leather gauntleted glove.

00:27:06.942 --> 00:27:10.099
LAURA: Taryon, you don't have to worry about
paying on this.

00:27:10.158 --> 00:27:12.258
SAM: How much do they cost?

00:27:12.258 --> 00:27:13.770
TALIESIN: A fortune.

00:27:13.770 --> 00:27:15.682
LAURA: I'm sure I have it written down somewhere.

00:27:15.682 --> 00:27:17.512
(all laugh)

00:27:17.512 --> 00:27:19.198
TALIESIN: We have books, there were books, we kept
books.

00:27:19.198 --> 00:27:21.918
LAURA: Yeah, there were books! There was also a
dragon attack.

00:27:22.906 --> 00:27:28.677
SAM: I fully expect to be treated as a full,
paying member of this and I will gladly contribute

00:27:28.677 --> 00:27:30.864
one-seventh of the salary.

00:27:30.864 --> 00:27:33.130
LAURA: Really not necessary.

00:27:33.130 --> 00:27:35.693
TALIESIN: It's quite all right.

00:27:35.693 --> 00:27:39.307
SAM: I insist. It's literally nothing to me.

00:27:39.307 --> 00:27:41.631
(all laugh)

00:27:41.631 --> 00:27:44.857
TRAVIS: Someone should teach him the Vox Machina
fight song, then.

00:27:44.857 --> 00:27:45.877
LAURA: You should do it, Grog.

00:27:45.877 --> 00:27:48.314
LIAM: Oh, yeah, Grog. You have the best voice of
all of us.

00:27:48.314 --> 00:27:50.625
TRAVIS: Yeah. Do you know the fight song?

00:27:50.625 --> 00:27:56.657
SAM: No, no, I've not learned any fight song. Most
of the songs that I've learned are either

00:27:56.657 --> 00:28:03.536
religious in nature or I've read them in books and
I've made up my own melodies to them. They were

00:28:03.536 --> 00:28:08.839
epic poems of yesteryear, and I sort of set them
to a little melody, mostly happy--

00:28:08.839 --> 00:28:10.554
TRAVIS: You made up songs, then?

00:28:10.554 --> 00:28:11.410
SAM: Well, I--

00:28:11.410 --> 00:28:15.853
TRAVIS: No, that's good. Each one of these songs is,
like, personal, to the member, right? So you make

00:28:15.907 --> 00:28:19.768
up a song about what Vox Machina means to you.

00:28:20.006 --> 00:28:21.132
SAM: I do that?

00:28:21.132 --> 00:28:22.247
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:28:22.247 --> 00:28:23.368
SAM: Wow.

00:28:23.368 --> 00:28:25.933
TRAVIS: We'll need it by sundown tomorrow.

00:28:25.933 --> 00:28:30.518
SAM: Doty, we have some work to do! Working
breakfast.

00:28:33.391 --> 00:28:35.251
MATT: Doty sits down right next to you.

00:28:35.251 --> 00:28:44.372
SAM: Machina, Machina. "Sock in a." Put a sock in
a-- no. Vox, Vox. Put it in the box.

00:28:44.372 --> 00:28:46.573
We'll work on this.

00:28:50.704 --> 00:28:54.707
LAURA: I'm scouring my notes for where I wrote
their salaries down.

00:28:54.707 --> 00:28:55.943
TALIESIN: That was a long time ago.

00:28:55.943 --> 00:28:58.073
LAURA: It was, but I've got my spiral here.

00:28:58.073 --> 00:29:07.810
SAM: They're 100 gold a month for five of them,
and then 50 gold a month for the other two. That's

00:29:07.810 --> 00:29:09.989
Vex's memory.

00:29:09.989 --> 00:29:13.655
LAURA: That's my memory! 100 gold a month for each
of the guards, and then what was the extra?

00:29:13.655 --> 00:29:17.298
SAM: Five of them get 100 gold a month and two of
them get 50 gold a month. I don't remember why or

00:29:17.298 --> 00:29:21.077
who, but that's how-- I think the guards get 100
and the cooks get 50, or something?

00:29:21.077 --> 00:29:23.529
MATT: Servants get 50, yeah.

00:29:23.529 --> 00:29:26.813
MARISHA: See, as I wrote down, I believe Shayne,
Cordell, Jarett, Kendrick,

00:29:26.813 --> 00:29:29.230
and Nitebe get 100 a month.

00:29:29.230 --> 00:29:31.684
LAURA: And then we always gave Jarett a bonus
because he was captain.

00:29:31.684 --> 00:29:34.914
MARISHA: Yeah. And because he was hot.

00:29:34.914 --> 00:29:40.050
MATT: Yeah. Well. There you go. Although Jarett is
technically not on your payroll anymore. Jarett's

00:29:40.050 --> 00:29:42.267
now a member of the Pale Guard in Whitestone.

00:29:42.267 --> 00:29:44.050
LAURA: Yeah, I remember.

00:29:44.050 --> 00:29:47.386
MARISHA: That's right. So, reducing our costs.
We're getting better at this.

00:29:49.877 --> 00:29:54.323
LAURA: Do you know where the rest of the crew is,
Shayne?

00:29:56.814 --> 00:30:03.282
MATT: "Kendrick is currently watching up on the
wall. Nitebe, I haven't seen since you sent him

00:30:03.452 --> 00:30:04.977
"off to Wildmount."

00:30:04.977 --> 00:30:06.934
LAURA: Right.

00:30:06.934 --> 00:30:12.767
MATT: And she gets a distant stare for a second
and says,

00:30:12.999 --> 00:30:19.280
"Well, Cordell didn't make it through the ordeal."

00:30:19.524 --> 00:30:21.244
TALIESIN: Really?

00:30:21.898 --> 00:30:26.808
MATT: You can see her kind of-- she has that
look of somebody who lost a close friend. She gets

00:30:26.973 --> 00:30:32.478
a distant stare for a second, clenches her jaw,
and then shakes her head

00:30:32.478 --> 00:30:35.581
and goes back to eating absentmindedly.

00:30:36.438 --> 00:30:41.413
MARISHA: We should have some sort of service,
then, or at least a dinner in Cordell's honor.

00:30:41.413 --> 00:30:45.137
MATT: "That's up to you. I've already had mine. My
piece has been said."

00:30:45.137 --> 00:30:47.738
LAURA: Well, we're glad to have you back.

00:30:47.738 --> 00:30:48.758
MATT: "Me, too."

00:30:48.758 --> 00:30:51.093
TALIESIN: Glad so many of us survived.

00:30:51.093 --> 00:30:52.243
MATT: "Not everyone."

00:30:52.243 --> 00:30:55.450
LAURA: Do any of us remember why Nitebe went to
Wildmount?

00:30:57.211 --> 00:31:01.828
MATT: You sent him a long time ago to look for
information about the Briarwoods.

00:31:02.394 --> 00:31:03.258
TALIESIN: Oh no!

00:31:03.258 --> 00:31:05.165
LAURA: Oh no!

00:31:05.537 --> 00:31:07.601
TRAVIS: We made him a snack!

00:31:08.260 --> 00:31:09.471
LAURA: We did?

00:31:09.471 --> 00:31:11.215
TRAVIS: He turned into a Hot Pocket, y'all!

00:31:11.215 --> 00:31:14.121
TALIESIN: Did we fight his undead body in the
crypt? Is that-- oh.

00:31:14.121 --> 00:31:18.692
MATT: You have not crossed his path.

00:31:18.769 --> 00:31:21.513
LAURA: Oh no, we killed our guard?

00:31:21.513 --> 00:31:23.449
MATT: You haven't heard anything from him in a
long time.

00:31:23.449 --> 00:31:27.107
TALIESIN and MARISHA: Vox Machina, not returning
your calls since 1992.

00:31:27.107 --> 00:31:34.536
MATT: To be fair, spies, by nature, live a very
dangerous lifestyle that they accept. Who knows

00:31:34.536 --> 00:31:37.371
what his whereabouts are or if he'll ever show up
again, but you haven't heard from him.

00:31:37.381 --> 00:31:39.983
LAURA: Maybe he just took our money and ran?

00:31:39.983 --> 00:31:41.179
MATT: It's also very possible.

00:31:41.179 --> 00:31:42.019
LAURA: I doubt it, though.

00:31:42.019 --> 00:31:43.655
TALIESIN: I would feel better about that, but
probably not.

00:31:43.655 --> 00:31:45.111
MARISHA: I can try and scry.

00:31:45.111 --> 00:31:49.475
TALIESIN: I just like the notion that maybe if we
just checked one more of those cells in the

00:31:49.475 --> 00:31:51.244
dungeon of Whitestone--

00:31:51.244 --> 00:31:54.249
MARISHA: Want me to scry on Nitebe? I can.

00:31:54.249 --> 00:31:59.813
TALIESIN: You know, I'll say just because I'm
curious where this particular rabbit hole leads--

00:31:59.813 --> 00:32:00.873
TRAVIS: Really?

00:32:00.873 --> 00:32:01.634
LAURA: Maybe.

00:32:01.634 --> 00:32:03.056
TALIESIN: It's not like we're going to go
wherever--

00:32:03.056 --> 00:32:04.623
TRAVIS: We're just eating breakfast. Go for it!

00:32:04.623 --> 00:32:05.930
LAURA: Yeah, just scry while we're eating
breakfast.

00:32:05.930 --> 00:32:07.583
MARISHA: All right. I scry on Nitebe.

00:32:07.583 --> 00:32:09.350
LIAM: I like that this is our breakfast
entertainment.

00:32:09.350 --> 00:32:13.912
TALIESIN: This is our version of looking at our
phones. This is Vox Machina going--

00:32:14.723 --> 00:32:17.933
LAURA: What do you see? Has he posted anything on
Facebook lately?

00:32:18.384 --> 00:32:22.609
TRAVIS: Have we figured out how to project this on
a 55-inch flat wall monitor for us yet?

00:32:22.609 --> 00:32:24.538
MARISHA: Actually, good question!

00:32:24.538 --> 00:32:27.710
TALIESIN: Yes, but the frame rate is only 120
frames per second.

00:32:27.710 --> 00:32:29.294
MARISHA: Yeah, it's only in black and white.

00:32:29.294 --> 00:32:35.024
LIAM: He posted on Instagram six weeks ago
and that was it.

00:32:35.024 --> 00:32:37.044
MATT: All right. So, are you doing Scry on
Nitebe?

00:32:37.100 --> 00:32:38.390
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:32:38.390 --> 00:32:39.895
LAURA: What do your scrying eyes see, Keyleth?

00:32:39.895 --> 00:32:44.819
MATT: So as you eat your breakfast, you take a
moment. You finish the small ritual on the center

00:32:44.819 --> 00:32:54.947
of the cold stone floor of your mess hall area of
the keep. You focus on your fuzzy but decent

00:32:54.947 --> 00:33:03.453
enough memory of Nitebe. As the ritual completes,
your vision focuses out for a second and then

00:33:03.453 --> 00:33:09.088
returns to you. There's no focus. There's no
Nitebe.

00:33:09.147 --> 00:33:10.930
LAURA: Oh no!

00:33:10.930 --> 00:33:13.816
TRAVIS: He's a Jolly Rancher in the belly of
Craven Edge!

00:33:16.473 --> 00:33:17.609
TALIESIN: What?

00:33:17.609 --> 00:33:20.797
MARISHA: I'm afraid the insane things that Grog
just said is correct.

00:33:23.086 --> 00:33:24.754
TRAVIS: I am a powerful magician.

00:33:24.754 --> 00:33:25.751
MARISHA: Yes.

00:33:25.751 --> 00:33:28.930
LIAM: A happy ranch hand in the--

00:33:28.930 --> 00:33:33.694
TRAVIS: Yeah, he's on the farm! He's running
through the fields of the farm, happy as can be.

00:33:33.694 --> 00:33:38.912
All the room to run he wants! (laughs)

00:33:38.912 --> 00:33:40.710
LAURA: This is actually very terrible.

00:33:40.710 --> 00:33:42.795
TALIESIN: This is really sad in the weirdest way.

00:33:42.795 --> 00:33:44.924
TRAVIS: I mean, yes. This is very dark, dark
time.

00:33:44.924 --> 00:33:47.040
LAURA: That's terrible.

00:33:47.040 --> 00:33:48.503
MARISHA: Travis!

00:33:48.503 --> 00:33:49.812
TALIESIN: I know. I can't.

00:33:49.812 --> 00:33:53.976
LIAM: We're laughing at ourselves. We haven't
thought of this guy in 72 years!

00:33:53.976 --> 00:33:56.359
TALIESIN: Pre-stream! It's been since pre-stream
that this has come up.

00:33:56.359 --> 00:33:57.425
LIAM: Yeah.

00:33:57.425 --> 00:33:58.915
TALIESIN: Okay. Wow.

00:33:58.915 --> 00:34:00.911
LAURA: Well.

00:34:00.911 --> 00:34:03.739
TRAVIS: Zero focus. Nothing.

00:34:03.739 --> 00:34:06.874
MATT: There's no creature to receive the scrying
spell.

00:34:06.874 --> 00:34:08.686
LIAM: My breakfast is not tasting as good.

00:34:08.686 --> 00:34:13.678
MATT: Which means he's either on another plane of
existence... or he's fucking dead!

00:34:13.678 --> 00:34:17.161
(all laugh)

00:34:17.161 --> 00:34:21.369
TALIESIN: Is that this version of "He's in the
Feywild. Everything's fine right now."

00:34:21.369 --> 00:34:23.792
MATT: You sent him to the great spy farm upstate.

00:34:23.792 --> 00:34:25.978
MARISHA: Whatever timeline you believe in.

00:34:25.978 --> 00:34:28.688
LAURA: At least we've avenged him, in a way.

00:34:28.688 --> 00:34:32.982
SAM: Did he have a family? What was his mother's
name?

00:34:32.982 --> 00:34:36.259
(all laugh)

00:34:36.259 --> 00:34:40.772
SAM: Because we might want to send her a gift or
some sort of a tribute in coin.

00:34:43.744 --> 00:34:46.483
LAURA: Yeah, I'll get right on that. Yeah.

00:34:46.483 --> 00:34:48.930
MARISHA: There's got to be public record, right?

00:34:48.930 --> 00:34:56.591
LAURA: Yeah. Yeah. Anywho. We're down a few
servants, we should probably get some more guards.

00:34:56.591 --> 00:35:00.126
Hey, Shayne, do you have anyone you'd recommend?

00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:06.366
MATT: "Honestly, me and Cordell worked as a team
for a long time. We didn't really make friends. I

00:35:06.366 --> 00:35:07.920
"can go looking in the city for you?"

00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:09.046
TRAVIS: No.

00:35:09.046 --> 00:35:10.106
LAURA: That's all right.

00:35:10.106 --> 00:35:13.262
TALIESIN: Keep your eyes open. We trust your
judgment.

00:35:13.262 --> 00:35:19.577
MATT: "Unless you want to go look for yourself? I
don't mind going and finding some good candidates."

00:35:19.577 --> 00:35:20.983
LAURA: Find a few more?

00:35:20.983 --> 00:35:21.870
MATT: "Yeah."

00:35:21.870 --> 00:35:25.932
MARISHA: I feel like the city is pretty
overwhelmed at the moment, though.

00:35:26.505 --> 00:35:27.888
MATT: "Up to you."

00:35:27.888 --> 00:35:31.190
LAURA: A lot of keeps have been ruined. Guards
might be looking for work, actually.

00:35:31.190 --> 00:35:35.569
MATT: "Yeah. People looking for work right now.
You look like you've got more important things to

00:35:35.569 --> 00:35:40.250
"focus on, so if you want to hire some guards and
you have trust in me, throw me some cash and I can

00:35:40.250 --> 00:35:41.813
"probably bring some people in."

00:35:41.813 --> 00:35:45.545
MARISHA: How do you feel about your workload? Do
you feel like you can handle this?

00:35:47.166 --> 00:35:52.883
MATT: "I can handle it." She shakes the bit of
scrambled eggs from her gauntleted hand.

00:35:52.883 --> 00:35:54.798
LAURA: Good leading. Good leading, Keyleth.

00:35:54.798 --> 00:35:59.618
TRAVIS: How's your keep bandwidth right now? Is
your plate full?

00:36:00.124 --> 00:36:04.411
LAURA: This is shitty. Can I roll for insight and
make sure that she's trustworthy? I feel like

00:36:04.411 --> 00:36:05.529
she's trustworthy, but--

00:36:05.529 --> 00:36:07.431
MATT: Totally.

00:36:09.701 --> 00:36:12.000
LAURA: I rolled poorly for my insight--

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:16.611
MATT: What did you roll? Even if you roll poorly,
with the bonuses.

00:36:16.802 --> 00:36:18.175
LAURA: 13?

00:36:18.175 --> 00:36:20.299
MATT: 13. She seems pretty straight.

00:36:20.299 --> 00:36:21.413
LAURA: All right.

00:36:21.413 --> 00:36:24.929
MATT: She's straight with you. She's not trying to
layer it at all.

00:36:24.929 --> 00:36:27.812
TALIESIN: We've got a trip to take, so perhaps
when we get back, we can audition some new

00:36:27.812 --> 00:36:32.242
candidates. That'll be fun. You'll enjoy that.

00:36:32.242 --> 00:36:36.370
SAM: Yes! I would enjoy anything.

00:36:36.370 --> 00:36:39.276
TALIESIN: Oh, it's quite fun. It's quite nice.

00:36:39.276 --> 00:36:41.429
SAM: I love me some fun.

00:36:41.429 --> 00:36:45.015
TRAVIS: Are you going to audition these new guards
like we did you?

00:36:45.015 --> 00:36:47.494
MATT: "Oh, I can figure something out. Don't
worry."

00:36:47.494 --> 00:36:51.180
LAURA: I like it. Make sure they're trustworthy,
if we're not going to be around. And I hand her

00:36:51.180 --> 00:36:59.115
500 gold for herself and for Kendrick.

00:36:59.115 --> 00:37:00.215
MATT: Yes.

00:37:00.215 --> 00:37:02.874
LAURA: And the three that you hire.

00:37:02.874 --> 00:37:09.364
MATT: "All right. I'll get on it, then. I think I
should have some time to go into town and do this

00:37:09.364 --> 00:37:15.752
"here within the afternoon." She grabs another roll
off the table and takes a bite of it.

00:37:15.752 --> 00:37:20.853
"Glad to have you back." And she turns around 
and leaves the room.

00:37:20.853 --> 00:37:21.608
TRAVIS: I like her.

00:37:21.608 --> 00:37:22.463
LAURA: She's cool.

00:37:22.463 --> 00:37:23.661
TRAVIS: Yep. Doesn't say too much.

00:37:23.661 --> 00:37:25.819
TALIESIN: Now I remember why we hired her in the
first place.

00:37:25.819 --> 00:37:30.783
TRAVIS: Because she fought well! She fought a
giant fucking scorpion in the courtyard. What are

00:37:30.783 --> 00:37:33.181
we doing today?

00:37:33.574 --> 00:37:39.178
MARISHA: Well, we talked about going to the Cobalt
Reserve to drop off this--

00:37:39.178 --> 00:37:43.153
LAURA: To drop off the evil book and do a little
research on the Nine fucking Hells.

00:37:43.153 --> 00:37:45.278
MARISHA: And then--

00:37:45.890 --> 00:37:53.396
TALIESIN: We need to do a bit of shopping, but
then we do have-- you're not quite done, are you?

00:37:54.426 --> 00:37:56.857
MARISHA: I mean, there's that.

00:37:56.857 --> 00:37:58.425
TALIESIN: I'm putting it out there.

00:37:58.425 --> 00:37:59.699
LIAM: Yeah, you up for it?

00:37:59.699 --> 00:38:00.694
TRAVIS: What?

00:38:00.694 --> 00:38:02.031
LAURA: She's got to get crowned.

00:38:02.031 --> 00:38:05.212
TRAVIS: (laughs)

00:38:05.212 --> 00:38:09.381
TALIESIN: Wow! I watched that work its way from
your ear all the way to your brain, there!

00:38:09.381 --> 00:38:10.838
TRAVIS: You're going to get crowned? Really?

00:38:10.838 --> 00:38:12.654
TALIESIN: It got lost on the way! It was amazing.

00:38:12.654 --> 00:38:13.631
LAURA: Even larger antlers?

00:38:13.631 --> 00:38:14.141
TRAVIS: Wow!

00:38:14.141 --> 00:38:16.238
MARISHA: Yeah, it's weird. I don't know.

00:38:16.238 --> 00:38:19.336
TRAVIS: Does it sit on your head, or on the
antlers?

00:38:19.336 --> 00:38:22.458
TALIESIN: They decorate it, like a winter's
festival.

00:38:22.458 --> 00:38:24.202
LIAM: They put antlers on the antlers.

00:38:24.202 --> 00:38:27.727
MATT: You do actually know, though you've never
seen anyone wear it, because in the time that

00:38:27.727 --> 00:38:36.308
you've been learning, there hasn't been a formal
Voice of the Tempest, it's not a crown. It's more

00:38:36.308 --> 00:38:41.883
of a mantle. It's a ceremonial mantle.

00:38:41.883 --> 00:38:44.569
LAURA: So you just hold it like a giant mantle?

00:38:44.569 --> 00:38:50.453
MARISHA: Well, not like a fireplace mantle.
Although I could, technically, transform into a

00:38:50.453 --> 00:38:52.125
fireplace now.

00:38:52.125 --> 00:38:53.547
TRAVIS: Why?

00:38:53.547 --> 00:38:55.580
MARISHA: Because I'm a badass.

00:38:55.580 --> 00:38:56.942
LAURA: (gasps) You could turn into doors!

00:38:56.942 --> 00:38:58.901
MARISHA: You know, I could, I'm pretty sure.

00:38:58.901 --> 00:38:59.885
MATT: Creature!

00:38:59.885 --> 00:39:02.698
MARISHA: No, I could! Hang on, hang on!

00:39:02.698 --> 00:39:03.561
LAURA: A mimic!

00:39:03.561 --> 00:39:06.953
MARISHA: A mimic! Couldn't I turn into a mimic
that could be a door? Or a mantle?

00:39:06.953 --> 00:39:10.719
MATT: Well, you haven't seen a door mimic before.
Because I don't hate you that much yet.

00:39:10.719 --> 00:39:12.151
LIAM: We haven't seen a base mimic before.

00:39:12.151 --> 00:39:12.837
LAURA: Yeah, we have!

00:39:12.837 --> 00:39:13.253
LIAM: In this game?

00:39:13.253 --> 00:39:14.492
MATT: You have seen a mimic, yeah.

00:39:14.492 --> 00:39:15.382
LIAM: I don't remember it.

00:39:15.382 --> 00:39:16.733
MATT: That was second session.

00:39:16.733 --> 00:39:18.694
LIAM: Ooh, shizz-nap!

00:39:18.694 --> 00:39:22.896
MATT: Yeah. That was second. A mimic and a
gelatinous cube in the same combat. I was like,

00:39:22.896 --> 00:39:25.506
"Hi guys! Welcome to D&amp;amp;D! (splat noise)"

00:39:25.506 --> 00:39:26.959
LIAM: That I remember, yeah.

00:39:26.959 --> 00:39:27.906
TALIESIN: Was I at that one?

00:39:27.906 --> 00:39:30.771
MATT: No, you weren't at that one, unfortunately.
That was before you came back to the campaign.

00:39:30.771 --> 00:39:34.692
MARISHA: Can I be a door?

00:39:34.692 --> 00:39:39.066
LAURA: I think it's a no.

00:39:39.306 --> 00:39:41.451
MATT: I'll look at Shapechange.

00:39:41.451 --> 00:39:42.776
MARISHA: We'll think about it. Anyway.

00:39:42.776 --> 00:39:43.882
MATT: I'm pretty sure it's just creatures.

00:39:43.882 --> 00:39:45.894
MARISHA: It's fine.

00:39:45.894 --> 00:39:48.337
LAURA: Okay! What are we fucking doing? What are
we doing?

00:39:48.337 --> 00:39:51.961
MATT: It's "different creature." If you encounter
a door-shaped creature in the future, you can

00:39:51.961 --> 00:39:54.734
totally do that.

00:39:55.725 --> 00:40:00.571
TALIESIN: Please! I'm sure you're having all sorts
of reservations and thoughts and processes about

00:40:00.571 --> 00:40:09.453
this notion, but I will admit, I have yet to
introduce your sister to the best part of being

00:40:09.453 --> 00:40:19.524
titled, which is dressing up. And it would be a
coronation! We could get some clothes! We could

00:40:19.524 --> 00:40:22.411
wear something lovely.

00:40:22.411 --> 00:40:27.321
LIAM: Does that jive with your hometown, though,
Kiki? Dressing up?

00:40:27.321 --> 00:40:29.315
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:40:29.315 --> 00:40:30.919
TALIESIN: It's a sign of respect.

00:40:30.987 --> 00:40:32.730
TRAVIS: Do all people with titles have to dress
up?

00:40:32.730 --> 00:40:33.797
TALIESIN: Yes.

00:40:33.797 --> 00:40:34.859
TRAVIS: Are you sure?

00:40:34.859 --> 00:40:36.098
TALIESIN: I am.

00:40:36.098 --> 00:40:39.126
MARISHA: We're very open-minded.

00:40:39.126 --> 00:40:42.303
LAURA: Oh, Grand Poobah. I'm afraid you have to
wear something quite formal.

00:40:42.303 --> 00:40:46.371
TRAVIS: You know what? Breakfast is disagreeing
with me. I think I have to go back to bed.

00:40:46.371 --> 00:40:48.313
TALIESIN: Heavy is the head that wears the crown.

00:40:48.313 --> 00:40:52.304
TRAVIS: (gags) Yeah, I don't feel well. I've got
to go. I go back up to my room.

00:40:52.304 --> 00:40:55.382
MATT: (laughs) Grog storms off.

00:40:55.382 --> 00:40:57.997
LAURA: I really thought we were going to get him
to bathe this time.

00:40:57.997 --> 00:41:01.056
MARISHA: Does he have an aversion to wearing
pants?

00:41:01.056 --> 00:41:03.598
TALIESIN: I'm sure we can work out something
without pants.

00:41:03.598 --> 00:41:10.824
LAURA: (laughs) Just a belt. A really glorious
belt. Over the dwarven belt.

00:41:10.824 --> 00:41:12.114
MARISHA: All blinged out.

00:41:12.114 --> 00:41:19.394
LIAM: It's like a kilt that's barely joined at the
bottom already. It's like a poopy diaper.

00:41:20.032 --> 00:41:23.637
TALIESIN: Just get him boots that go all the way
up to the neck.

00:41:24.828 --> 00:41:26.345
LIAM: It literally is a poopy diaper.

00:41:26.345 --> 00:41:28.080
MATT: Poopy diaper of dwarvenkind.

00:41:28.080 --> 00:41:29.708
LAURA: Gross!

00:41:30.767 --> 00:41:32.151
TALIESIN: Activate number one or number two.

00:41:32.151 --> 00:41:33.262
TRAVIS: Battle kilt.

00:41:33.262 --> 00:41:35.830
LAURA: Seriously, though, what are we doing?

00:41:35.830 --> 00:41:40.540
LIAM: Well, we're in town. We've got this book and
a library, but we should decide what we're going

00:41:40.540 --> 00:41:47.191
to do tomorrow. What's to wait? Why don't we go
home?

00:41:47.191 --> 00:41:59.048
MARISHA: (stammers) Well, it's just weird. It's
just weird. It's been so long. It's a lot of

00:41:59.048 --> 00:42:01.618
build-up, and then it's going to be over.

00:42:01.618 --> 00:42:04.171
LIAM: You are adorable right now.

00:42:04.171 --> 00:42:07.737
MARISHA: I'm serious!

00:42:08.227 --> 00:42:12.338
LAURA: Maybe your dad will have information on the
Nine Hells.

00:42:12.338 --> 00:42:19.816
MARISHA: He could, yeah. It's just, my whole life
has been building up to this, and if we complete

00:42:19.816 --> 00:42:21.905
it, that makes it real.

00:42:21.905 --> 00:42:27.662
LAURA: Wait, I do have a question, actually. If
you complete it, do they want you to stay?

00:42:27.662 --> 00:42:33.647
MARISHA: If I complete it, then I am the Voice of
the Tempest. I imagine I can do whatever I want.

00:42:33.647 --> 00:42:35.023
Right?

00:42:35.023 --> 00:42:36.526
LAURA: Or you stay and lead your people.

00:42:36.526 --> 00:42:39.553
LIAM: Yeah. Does the Tempest go on road trips?

00:42:39.553 --> 00:42:45.450
MARISHA: I don't know.

00:42:45.450 --> 00:42:46.735
LIAM: Oh.

00:42:46.735 --> 00:42:49.421
TALIESIN: Has your life been leading up to this
moment, or has your life been leading up to

00:42:49.421 --> 00:42:54.125
everything that happens after this moment?

00:42:55.548 --> 00:42:59.056
MARISHA: I'm not entirely sure of the difference
of what you just said.

00:42:59.056 --> 00:43:03.064
TALIESIN: I'm just saying, as somebody who spent
several years of their life avoiding the one thing

00:43:03.064 --> 00:43:12.047
that would make them even remotely happy, maybe
just barreling through it is the way to go. We'll

00:43:12.047 --> 00:43:14.728
be there!

00:43:14.966 --> 00:43:19.265
MARISHA: I guess it is that notion of leading up
to this one moment that you've thought of for a

00:43:19.265 --> 00:43:23.190
while. Once you complete that, what happens next?

00:43:23.190 --> 00:43:25.517
LAURA: It's just like getting married, Keyleth.

00:43:25.517 --> 00:43:27.119
MARISHA: Is it, though? Yeah?

00:43:27.119 --> 00:43:30.514
LAURA: It's all the planning. That just freaks you
out, that's all.

00:43:30.514 --> 00:43:33.095
MARISHA: Yeah, sure.

00:43:33.334 --> 00:43:34.587
LIAM: What do you know about that?

00:43:34.587 --> 00:43:37.337
TALIESIN: I was going to say, is that theoretical
or experiential?

00:43:37.337 --> 00:43:38.251
LAURA: Theoretical, obviously!

00:43:38.251 --> 00:43:40.174
TALIESIN: Okay. Just checking.

00:43:40.174 --> 00:43:44.939
LIAM: She does read a lot. Or she used to.

00:43:45.172 --> 00:43:46.516
TALIESIN: She still reads a lot.

00:43:46.516 --> 00:43:48.046
LAURA: I do! (laughs)

00:43:48.046 --> 00:43:49.894
LIAM: Are you sharing a library?

00:43:49.894 --> 00:43:50.781
TALIESIN: Lots of things.

00:43:50.781 --> 00:43:53.708
LIAM: Yeah, yeah. I don't need to hear about it.

00:43:53.708 --> 00:43:56.831
TALIESIN: No, you don't. That's why I was so
excited that you pried.

00:43:59.324 --> 00:44:07.097
MARISHA: It's whatever you guys think is best. We
can go to Westruun first, or we can go to Zephra

00:44:07.097 --> 00:44:09.416
first. Just whatever you want.

00:44:09.416 --> 00:44:12.660
LIAM: Oh, that's a big decision for you to make, I
think.

00:44:12.660 --> 00:44:15.958
MARISHA: No, it's the difference of a day or two,
right?

00:44:15.958 --> 00:44:22.121
MATT: You hear the heavy footfalls upstairs of
Grog's feet and a door slamming shut.

00:44:22.121 --> 00:44:23.351
TALIESIN: He took his time.

00:44:23.351 --> 00:44:29.321
MARISHA: Do we need an extra day to convince Grog
to wear pants? That could be the deciding factor!

00:44:29.321 --> 00:44:31.732
Maybe we should put it on him. Right?

00:44:31.732 --> 00:44:32.480
LAURA: Keyleth!

00:44:32.480 --> 00:44:33.133
MARISHA: What?

00:44:33.133 --> 00:44:34.450
LAURA: Make a decision.

00:44:34.450 --> 00:44:36.226
MARISHA: (groans)

00:44:36.226 --> 00:44:41.091
LAURA: Leader. You're going to be a leader. Just
make a choice.

00:44:41.091 --> 00:44:47.545
LIAM: Everybody else believes in you. Why
shouldn't you?

00:44:48.204 --> 00:44:50.043
TALIESIN: Pencil or pen?

00:44:50.043 --> 00:44:52.519
MARISHA: (laughs)

00:44:52.519 --> 00:44:56.964
LAURA: I'm looking forward to buying a dress
either way.

00:44:57.710 --> 00:45:02.003
MARISHA: Let's check in at Westruun. Drop off the
book.

00:45:02.003 --> 00:45:03.287
LAURA: And see how you feel.

00:45:03.287 --> 00:45:05.996
MARISHA: We'll head from Westruun to Zephra.

00:45:05.996 --> 00:45:07.520
LAURA: Good plan.

00:45:07.520 --> 00:45:08.502
MARISHA: All right.

00:45:08.502 --> 00:45:09.922
TALIESIN: You're going to be very good at this.

00:45:09.922 --> 00:45:11.954
MARISHA: Man! Decision-making is hard.

00:45:11.954 --> 00:45:13.035
TALIESIN: I know.

00:45:13.035 --> 00:45:14.029
MARISHA: So many choices.

00:45:14.029 --> 00:45:16.344
LAURA: So wait. (valley girl voice) Would the
shops here be better to buy a dress than the

00:45:16.344 --> 00:45:17.810
shops in Westruun?

00:45:17.981 --> 00:45:18.939
TALIESIN: Wow!

00:45:18.939 --> 00:45:22.736
MARISHA: Good question! Who's importing more?
Where's fashion week happening?

00:45:22.736 --> 00:45:24.419
LIAM: They're both handicapped, aren't they?

00:45:24.648 --> 00:45:27.076
LAURA: That's what I mean.

00:45:27.076 --> 00:45:31.223
MATT: They've both been under some recent duress,
so it really could go either way. Emon is

00:45:31.223 --> 00:45:35.057
definitely more of the cultural hub, especially
since it's such a huge port town. You get a lot

00:45:35.057 --> 00:45:40.850
more cultural influence from other continents and
heavier trade. Emon would probably have better

00:45:40.850 --> 00:45:47.889
outfits. But Westruun-- which, Grog, you grew up
in, and you guys have spent some time in-- does

00:45:47.889 --> 00:45:54.315
have its own textiles district. There are weddings
that happen there. They have other events where

00:45:54.315 --> 00:45:55.586
they sell fine--

00:45:55.586 --> 00:45:57.789
LIAM: What's Westruun like? Pittsburgh?

00:45:57.789 --> 00:46:00.596
MATT: You could say, yeah.

00:46:00.596 --> 00:46:01.728
TRAVIS: It's like Wisconsin.

00:46:01.728 --> 00:46:04.353
TALIESIN: Okay, that's less disappointing.

00:46:04.353 --> 00:46:09.003
MATT: Emon's the New York. Westruun's the
Pittsburgh.

00:46:09.003 --> 00:46:11.347
TALIESIN: Whitestone's the Boulder.

00:46:11.347 --> 00:46:12.807
MATT: Kind of, yeah! (laughs)

00:46:12.807 --> 00:46:13.876
TALIESIN: It's Boulder, Colorado.

00:46:13.876 --> 00:46:14.676
LIAM: Yeah, I like it!

00:46:14.676 --> 00:46:15.586
TALIESIN: There's nothing happening.

00:46:15.586 --> 00:46:16.403
TRAVIS: Boulder, baby.

00:46:16.403 --> 00:46:17.401
LAURA: But it's beautiful.

00:46:17.401 --> 00:46:21.612
MARISHA: If it's the Pittsburgh, then we should go
now, because everything closes at five.

00:46:22.805 --> 00:46:27.109
LIAM: We could also Tree Stride to Vasselheim for
the fanciest of shopping.

00:46:27.109 --> 00:46:29.896
If you want to go all-out.

00:46:29.896 --> 00:46:36.379
TALIESIN: In theory, they'll have your crest on
file. That's one of those things, any dressmaker

00:46:36.379 --> 00:46:40.925
would actually know how to assemble something
appropriate for any house

00:46:40.925 --> 00:46:43.102
of any nobility that exists.

00:46:43.102 --> 00:46:46.893
LAURA: You know what? Vasselheim will actually
know a little bit about Orcus and I bet the Nine

00:46:46.893 --> 00:46:49.465
Hells, as well, being the god hub.

00:46:49.465 --> 00:46:50.786
TALIESIN: Ooh, a work vacation.

00:46:50.786 --> 00:46:54.663
MARISHA: We did mention if we wanted to drop off
the book at Westruun or Vasselheim--

00:46:54.663 --> 00:46:56.927
LAURA: We should go to Vasselheim!

00:46:56.927 --> 00:46:58.144
MARISHA: Do we want to do that instead?

00:46:58.144 --> 00:46:59.438
LAURA: Decision's fucking made. Let's go.

00:46:59.438 --> 00:47:00.364
MARISHA: All right! Let's go to Vasselheim.

00:47:00.364 --> 00:47:01.911
SAM: I've never been. That sounds great!

00:47:01.911 --> 00:47:04.112
MARISHA: How far north have you been, Tary?

00:47:04.112 --> 00:47:07.681
SAM: Quite far north. Right? I'm from the north?

00:47:07.681 --> 00:47:09.301
MARISHA: You're from Wildmount, correct?

00:47:09.301 --> 00:47:16.983
MATT: You're from Wildmount, which is-- as far as
you know, from where you grew up, Tal'Dorei is to

00:47:16.983 --> 00:47:26.286
the southwest of where you grew up. Issylra, which
is where Vasselheim is,

00:47:26.286 --> 00:47:30.959
and Othanzia is far to the east.

00:47:30.959 --> 00:47:34.165
LIAM: First there was the dinosaurs.

00:47:34.165 --> 00:47:36.637
SAM: But I lived in the north of that place.

00:47:36.637 --> 00:47:44.485
MATT: You lived in the north of Wildmount. It's
pretty Siberian, you would consider it.

00:47:44.485 --> 00:47:45.287
SAM: Yeah.

00:47:45.287 --> 00:47:47.092
LIAM: I want to go to there.

00:47:47.092 --> 00:47:49.922
SAM: I thrive in cold places. Is this such a
place?

00:47:49.922 --> 00:47:52.621
MARISHA: It is quite chilly.

00:47:52.621 --> 00:47:55.080
TALIESIN: Not as cold as my home, but it'll do.

00:47:55.080 --> 00:48:00.224
SAM: I have some excellent cold-weather robes in
my bag of holding that I would love to flaunt.

00:48:00.288 --> 00:48:03.502
LAURA: Let's go.

00:48:03.502 --> 00:48:05.290
MARISHA: Let's go.

00:48:05.290 --> 00:48:09.666
TALIESIN: We also probably need a few healing
potions and such, and we'll probably have better

00:48:09.666 --> 00:48:11.049
luck somewhere else.

00:48:11.049 --> 00:48:12.163
LAURA: Yeah.

00:48:12.163 --> 00:48:14.128
TALIESIN: Yes!

00:48:14.128 --> 00:48:16.460
MARISHA: Anything else we need to do before we
leave Emon?

00:48:16.460 --> 00:48:18.855
SAM: They'll have potions and things there?

00:48:18.855 --> 00:48:20.411
TALIESIN: We probably need to stock up a bit.

00:48:20.411 --> 00:48:22.381
SAM: Yes. They'll have these things at
Vasselheim?

00:48:22.381 --> 00:48:23.244
LAURA: Yeah.

00:48:23.244 --> 00:48:24.062
SAM: Great.

00:48:24.062 --> 00:48:27.040
TRAVIS: You don't just have some health potions in
your armor? You can't just plink one out of your

00:48:27.040 --> 00:48:28.462
nutsack or something?

00:48:28.462 --> 00:48:35.970
SAM: I'm going to reach onto my robe and pull out
a patch that produces four healing potions.

00:48:35.970 --> 00:48:36.916
TRAVIS: What?!

00:48:36.916 --> 00:48:39.109
MATT: There you go.

00:48:39.109 --> 00:48:40.609
LAURA: Are they regular, or are they greater?

00:48:40.609 --> 00:48:41.226
SAM: They're regular.

00:48:41.226 --> 00:48:42.289
LAURA: Oh. All right.

00:48:42.289 --> 00:48:43.096
TRAVIS: That's great!

00:48:43.096 --> 00:48:45.383
LAURA: That's pretty cool.

00:48:45.383 --> 00:48:48.374
TRAVIS: Man! We should tear you apart limb from
limb and see what fucking shakes out!

00:48:48.374 --> 00:48:49.707
SAM: Please don't.

00:48:49.707 --> 00:48:52.437
LIAM: Does that regenerate and come back? Is it
one time only?

00:48:52.437 --> 00:48:56.137
SAM: No, but I'll just buy another one if I run
out.

00:48:56.137 --> 00:48:57.100
TRAVIS: Another robe?

00:48:57.100 --> 00:48:57.777
SAM: Yeah.

00:48:57.777 --> 00:48:58.737
TRAVIS: Wow.

00:48:58.737 --> 00:49:01.311
TALIESIN: It's like a four-pack of medieval
Five-Hour Energy drink.

00:49:01.311 --> 00:49:04.328
MATT: Basically.

00:49:04.328 --> 00:49:06.877
SAM: It's literally Monster Energy.

00:49:06.877 --> 00:49:09.618
TALIESIN: That's like a 1st-level healing potion.

00:49:09.618 --> 00:49:14.954
MARISHA: Tary, Vasselheim does get a little bit--

00:49:14.954 --> 00:49:16.504
LIAM: They don't like magic.

00:49:16.504 --> 00:49:18.796
SAM: They don't like magic?

00:49:18.796 --> 00:49:19.988
LAURA: Arcane magic.

00:49:19.988 --> 00:49:21.066
MARISHA: Arcane magic.

00:49:21.066 --> 00:49:25.341
SAM: I practice alchemic magic, mostly, so I'll be
okay. I think.

00:49:25.341 --> 00:49:28.082
TALIESIN: You might want to keep a low profile.

00:49:28.082 --> 00:49:37.300
MATT: Alchemical elements, yes. But a lot of your
spells and infusing everything is arcane-based.

00:49:37.300 --> 00:49:41.461
And you have a giant arcane metal man following
you around.

00:49:41.461 --> 00:49:44.525
SAM: Oh! Maybe I should disguise Doty in some
way.

00:49:44.525 --> 00:49:46.242
MARISHA: Can you do that?

00:49:46.242 --> 00:49:47.132
SAM: No.

00:49:47.132 --> 00:49:49.101
(all laugh)

00:49:49.101 --> 00:49:51.186
SAM: I can throw a cloth over him or--

00:49:51.186 --> 00:49:54.148
LAURA: Make him look like he's just a big dude
wearing a robe with a hood over his head.

00:49:54.148 --> 00:49:55.194
TALIESIN: Or a ghost.

00:49:55.194 --> 00:49:56.953
SAM: Or a ghost! Is it Halloween?

00:49:56.953 --> 00:49:59.070
MARISHA: I don't think so.

00:49:59.070 --> 00:50:02.392
TALIESIN: It is sadly not Hallow's Eve. We can put
him in some armor or some

00:50:02.392 --> 00:50:04.094
fake cloth of some sort.

00:50:04.094 --> 00:50:05.343
LAURA: Let's just put a robe over him.

00:50:05.343 --> 00:50:08.867
SAM: Could you and I craft something for him
before the journey, like a face mask of some sort

00:50:08.867 --> 00:50:10.915
that makes him look like a brave warrior?

00:50:10.915 --> 00:50:17.267
LIAM: I mean, I am really good at disguises. I
haven't flexed those muscles in a while, but--

00:50:17.267 --> 00:50:18.790
LAURA: Let him give it a go.

00:50:18.790 --> 00:50:20.874
SAM: You can make disguises?

00:50:20.874 --> 00:50:24.443
LIAM: I can work with a little bit of nose putty,
and yeah, I can make a fake face for this guy.

00:50:24.443 --> 00:50:26.846
SAM: That I would love to see.

00:50:26.846 --> 00:50:31.386
MATT: As best as you understand, it isn't like,
"Oh my god, there's some sort of magic source in

00:50:31.386 --> 00:50:35.547
"Vasselhiem, arrest everyone involved." It's not
super illegal, it's just generally frowned upon

00:50:35.547 --> 00:50:37.983
and calls suspicion.

00:50:37.983 --> 00:50:41.584
SAM: No, I want to pursue you making a mask for
Doty.

00:50:41.584 --> 00:50:44.062
LIAM: So do I. I feel really rusty.

00:50:44.062 --> 00:50:46.192
LAURA: I want to help him because I'm a rogue,
too.

00:50:46.192 --> 00:50:50.173
TALIESIN: Well let's go full Cinderella on this.
Let's get all the mice involved.

00:50:50.234 --> 00:50:52.141
LIAM: What do we want this guy to look like?

00:50:52.141 --> 00:50:54.719
SAM: Well, I mean, there's no disguising the fact
that he's eight feet tall

00:50:54.719 --> 00:50:57.228
and squeaks when he walks.

00:50:57.228 --> 00:50:58.923
(all laugh)

00:50:58.923 --> 00:51:01.824
LIAM: Should we turn him into a goliath, then?

00:51:01.824 --> 00:51:05.170
SAM: I mean, are we going to do full body paint
for this?

00:51:05.170 --> 00:51:09.967
LAURA: What if we just put a stealth cloak over
him or something?

00:51:09.967 --> 00:51:11.500
LIAM: Stealth cloak? Do you have a stealth cloak?

00:51:11.500 --> 00:51:12.966
LAURA: Yeah, then paint his-- yeah, I do.

00:51:12.966 --> 00:51:15.229
TALIESIN: Let's make him look like a goliath that
wears a lot of robes

00:51:15.229 --> 00:51:16.778
because he was horribly scarred.

00:51:16.778 --> 00:51:18.274
LAURA: I start taking robes out.

00:51:18.274 --> 00:51:20.517
TALIESIN: Grog, how do you feel about this? I feel
like you have the look--

00:51:20.517 --> 00:51:21.576
LAURA: Grog's upstairs.

00:51:21.576 --> 00:51:24.034
TALIESIN: Oh, you're upstairs, you're not actually
here. Never mind.

00:51:24.034 --> 00:51:25.977
MARISHA: He's upset about the notion of pants.

00:51:25.977 --> 00:51:27.485
TALIESIN: I know.

00:51:27.485 --> 00:51:31.016
SAM: Making him look like he is in a suit of armor
seems like a thing.

00:51:31.016 --> 00:51:35.768
TALIESIN: We could put him in a suit of armor.

00:51:35.768 --> 00:51:37.409
SAM: He's already metal.

00:51:37.409 --> 00:51:42.201
LAURA: Fine. I take all of the robes off. Do
whatever you want.

00:51:42.201 --> 00:51:49.603
TALIESIN: Is Doty strong enough to wear a suit of
armor?

00:51:49.603 --> 00:51:50.537
SAM: He's strong.

00:51:50.537 --> 00:51:52.106
MATT: I mean, decorative.

00:51:52.106 --> 00:51:53.414
TALIESIN: Yes, decorative.

00:51:53.414 --> 00:51:55.374
MATT: Yeah. Doty is his own suit of armor.

00:51:55.374 --> 00:51:56.351
LAURA: Why are we doing this?

00:51:56.351 --> 00:51:57.281
TALIESIN: Because this is funny.

00:51:57.281 --> 00:51:58.267
MATT: Because it's amazing.

00:51:58.267 --> 00:52:00.451
TRAVIS: He's a giant automaton!

00:52:00.451 --> 00:52:01.402
LAURA: Just wear a robe!

00:52:01.402 --> 00:52:02.545
TALIESIN: I'm having a wonderful time.

00:52:02.545 --> 00:52:05.934
SAM: I want Doty with a fake nose. That's all I
want.

00:52:05.934 --> 00:52:07.089
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah, do that!

00:52:07.089 --> 00:52:08.598
TALIESIN: Groucho Marx nose and glasses.

00:52:08.598 --> 00:52:10.036
(all laugh)

00:52:10.036 --> 00:52:17.344
LIAM: I'm going to need your help because I'm not
used to working on robots. You can make some mesh

00:52:17.344 --> 00:52:28.460
work, right? And we can get some clay, and some
spectacles like yours, but maybe shaded. Yeah?

00:52:28.460 --> 00:52:30.385
TRAVIS: He's only got the one pair now.

00:52:30.385 --> 00:52:32.073
TALIESIN: We can make him a mask at the very
least.

00:52:32.073 --> 00:52:32.529
LIAM: Yeah.

00:52:32.529 --> 00:52:33.466
TALIESIN: All right.

00:52:33.466 --> 00:52:35.291
LIAM: I have made masks for myself.

00:52:35.291 --> 00:52:37.610
MARISHA: This is going to look ridiculous!

00:52:37.610 --> 00:52:38.649
MATT: I'm so excited.

00:52:38.649 --> 00:52:42.361
MARISHA: Everyone's going to be like, that's a
robot wearing a mask!

00:52:42.361 --> 00:52:46.659
TALIESIN: No, it's just a man with no arms, legs,
heads, limbs and chest.

00:52:46.659 --> 00:52:48.045
LIAM: We don't have to, I mean--

00:52:48.045 --> 00:52:49.299
TALIESIN: No, we're doing it.

00:52:49.299 --> 00:52:50.799
SAM: Let's spend some time.

00:52:50.799 --> 00:52:54.831
TALIESIN: Everyone else can get their little
run-around of Westruun done

00:52:54.831 --> 00:52:56.498
while we sit making a robot.

00:52:56.498 --> 00:53:01.595
MATT: Okay. So, Vax, needing materials to prepare
such an elaborate--

00:53:01.595 --> 00:53:04.023
LIAM: Hey, give me some money. I don't have any
money. I never have money.

00:53:04.023 --> 00:53:07.509
LAURA: You need money to go buy a stupid mask for
a stupid robot?

00:53:07.509 --> 00:53:10.300
LIAM: This is the first time in this entire
goddamn campaign--

00:53:10.300 --> 00:53:11.130
LAURA: No, it's not.

00:53:11.130 --> 00:53:11.782
LIAM: Yes, it is.

00:53:11.782 --> 00:53:12.856
LAURA: No, it isn't.

00:53:12.856 --> 00:53:14.946
LIAM: Give me some fucking money.

00:53:14.946 --> 00:53:17.734
SAM: Or, I can give you money.

00:53:17.734 --> 00:53:18.877
LIAM: I want her money.

00:53:18.877 --> 00:53:19.646
SAM: All right.

00:53:19.646 --> 00:53:21.351
LIAM: Thanks.

00:53:21.351 --> 00:53:23.651
TALIESIN: It is important for him to express
himself.

00:53:23.651 --> 00:53:26.134
LAURA: I have passed out money lately, before, I
think.

00:53:26.134 --> 00:53:32.033
LIAM: I throw myself off of things for this one,
she can't give me 50 gold pieces.

00:53:32.033 --> 00:53:32.957
LAURA: Fine!

00:53:32.957 --> 00:53:33.844
LIAM: Thank you.

00:53:33.844 --> 00:53:36.524
LAURA: How about everybody gets a thousand gold.

00:53:36.606 --> 00:53:38.033
LIAM: It's a party!

00:53:38.033 --> 00:53:38.834
TRAVIS: Really?

00:53:38.834 --> 00:53:40.790
LAURA: Yeah, everybody take a thousand gold.

00:53:40.790 --> 00:53:41.385
SAM: Me too?

00:53:41.385 --> 00:53:42.148
LAURA: Except for you.

00:53:42.148 --> 00:53:50.414
(all laugh)

00:53:50.414 --> 00:53:51.181
LIAM: Hey, Matt?

00:53:51.181 --> 00:53:51.704
MATT: Yeah?

00:53:51.704 --> 00:53:54.440
LIAM: Do I have this ability? I feel like I
remember it, but I'm looking through--

00:53:54.440 --> 00:53:55.145
TRAVIS: You don't know?!

00:53:55.145 --> 00:53:57.516
(all laugh)

00:53:57.516 --> 00:53:59.775
TALIESIN: Oh no!

00:53:59.775 --> 00:54:06.565
MATT: I'm pretty sure you do! I think you have a
disguise kit. It's not an ability per se.

00:54:06.565 --> 00:54:08.623
LIAM: I have Imposter, right?

00:54:08.623 --> 00:54:09.595
MATT: Right, you have Imposter.

00:54:09.595 --> 00:54:11.732
LIAM: That's me, can I use it on a robot?

00:54:11.732 --> 00:54:15.382
SAM: By the way, Liam, if you don't have this
ability, I want to see this even more.

00:54:15.382 --> 00:54:17.684
LIAM: Oh, we're doing it.

00:54:17.684 --> 00:54:19.447
MARISHA: Just bluff your way through it.

00:54:19.447 --> 00:54:23.284
MATT: No, because Imposter is the ability to mimic
somebody else. It has nothing to do-- A disguise

00:54:23.284 --> 00:54:25.178
kit is what you're using.

00:54:25.178 --> 00:54:27.141
LIAM: And I've always had a disguise kit.

00:54:27.141 --> 00:54:28.021
MATT: Correct.

00:54:28.021 --> 00:54:30.773
LIAM: Because I did something back in the home
game, I did something.

00:54:30.773 --> 00:54:35.193
MATT: Yeah, you've done a couple of things. But
it's not an ability you have.

00:54:35.193 --> 00:54:36.416
LIAM: No?

00:54:36.416 --> 00:54:39.464
MATT: Well, you do have an ability, but it's only
for you, it's not for Doty.

00:54:39.464 --> 00:54:42.553
TALIESIN: You own a cardboard box with a bunch of
stuff.

00:54:42.553 --> 00:54:45.662
MATT: So here's what we do. First and foremost,
you have to go to the town and gather supplies

00:54:45.662 --> 00:54:49.318
because your disguise kit is designed for very
small prosthetics and things.

00:54:49.388 --> 00:54:50.752
This is a large endeavor.

00:54:50.752 --> 00:54:52.088
LIAM: This is five times that.

00:54:52.088 --> 00:54:54.233
MATT: Yeah. So I'm going to need you to roll an
investigation check. This is your ability to go

00:54:54.233 --> 00:54:58.472
around the town and find, through the midst of
chaos of Emon trying to repair itself, somebody

00:54:58.472 --> 00:55:00.781
who can sell you the supplies necessary.

00:55:00.781 --> 00:55:01.995
LIAM: Well, that is a 20.

00:55:01.995 --> 00:55:03.052
TALIESIN: I need some clay.

00:55:03.052 --> 00:55:03.822
MATT: A natural 20?

00:55:03.822 --> 00:55:04.692
LIAM: No, not a natural 20.

00:55:04.692 --> 00:55:06.369
MATT: But a 20? That's still fine. All right, it
takes you--

00:55:06.369 --> 00:55:08.871
TALIESIN: I gave him a list.

00:55:08.871 --> 00:55:12.397
MATT: It takes you about three hours, round trip,
to go into the city, locate the location, and

00:55:12.397 --> 00:55:17.071
purchase-- relatively inexpensive, comparatively,
about ten gold pieces for materials to do this.

00:55:17.127 --> 00:55:24.959
Which is expensive for anyone who's just-- and a
lot of it is burlap material that's gone over with

00:55:24.959 --> 00:55:31.128
a weatherproofing liquid, that when it solidifies,
it gives almost a rubbery texture. It's used for

00:55:31.128 --> 00:55:36.408
carts that are traveling a long distance under bad
weather. And you figure that might resemble some

00:55:36.408 --> 00:55:45.377
sort of a skin-type texture at a distance. You
gather other elements to build a mask, to wrap

00:55:45.377 --> 00:55:52.078
things in material, to block things that might
look metallic. So yeah, so you gather things that

00:55:52.078 --> 00:55:57.669
might work in your favor. So as you collect this,
what are you guys working on?

00:55:57.669 --> 00:55:59.079
SAM: We're making a mask?

00:55:59.079 --> 00:56:02.186
TALIESIN: Well, the first thing that we're going
to need, is we're going to need a way of

00:56:02.186 --> 00:56:06.229
connecting this to him without limiting his
movement, so I'm making so it's a very accessible,

00:56:06.229 --> 00:56:11.781
easy harness to get this on and off. And starting
to design and put together how we're going to--

00:56:11.781 --> 00:56:19.331
what I'd like to make is a couple-- a porcelain
cover for the hands and face so that it actually

00:56:19.331 --> 00:56:23.308
looks like perhaps-- it won't draw immediate
suspicion, but if it does, it will look like

00:56:23.308 --> 00:56:26.038
somebody with an artificial limb, maybe they've
been hurt.

00:56:26.038 --> 00:56:27.520
LIAM: Get me ten sets of scissors.

00:56:27.520 --> 00:56:30.926
MATT: (laughs) So are you crafting the porcelain?

00:56:30.926 --> 00:56:32.412
TALIESIN: I am. I've got the kiln.

00:56:32.412 --> 00:56:36.445
MATT: Yes, but your materials, you're used to
using--

00:56:36.445 --> 00:56:41.910
TALIESIN: Instead of porcelain, I'm going for the
ceramics that I use for some of my build. It's

00:56:41.910 --> 00:56:48.830
more practical. I've been working on some jewelry
shit, I could genuinely learn how to do this.

00:56:48.830 --> 00:56:53.744
MATT: This is true, but the skillset for jewelry
is very different from the skillset of porcelain.

00:56:53.744 --> 00:56:56.054
LIAM: I need you to make a rig, like in a video
game. Can you do that?

00:56:56.054 --> 00:56:58.603
LAURA: I'm going go into town and buy some plates
for Laina.

00:56:58.603 --> 00:57:00.715
MATT: Okay. I will say--

00:57:00.715 --> 00:57:03.133
TALIESIN: I'm willing to have this--

00:57:03.133 --> 00:57:06.030
SAM: We could just use mud from outside.

00:57:06.030 --> 00:57:09.752
MATT: Do you have a set of potter's tools? Because
that would be specifically what would be used for

00:57:09.752 --> 00:57:14.976
this, if you're going to be working with ceramics
and porcelain.

00:57:14.976 --> 00:57:17.623
TALIESIN: Can I roll to see? Because I have a
kiln, so I might have it,

00:57:17.623 --> 00:57:18.980
but I don't know if I have it--

00:57:18.980 --> 00:57:23.863
MATT: But you have a kiln that's designed more
for-- it's more of a metal-use forge.

00:57:23.863 --> 00:57:25.258
TALIESIN: It's more of a metal-use forge.

00:57:25.258 --> 00:57:29.435
MATT: So it'll destroy ceramics. It burns at a
certain heat.

00:57:29.435 --> 00:57:31.737
TRAVIS: This could be the dumbest--

00:57:31.737 --> 00:57:34.715
MARISHA: This is the best thing we've ever wasted
time on.

00:57:34.715 --> 00:57:36.521
MATT: I'm so excited.

00:57:36.521 --> 00:57:41.880
TALIESIN: If prototype one fails, I'll make it out
of pewter.

00:57:41.880 --> 00:57:46.548
MATT: Okay. This is an adjacent skill set. You're
not going to get your proficiency bonus to it, but

00:57:46.548 --> 00:57:52.800
you do have materials to essentially try it. I
want you to go ahead and roll a base dexterity

00:57:52.800 --> 00:57:57.908
check. Just add your dexterity modifier. You're
not proficient.

00:57:58.372 --> 00:58:01.539
TALIESIN: I'm trusting in Gil, because he also
can't make a pot.

00:58:01.539 --> 00:58:04.079
TRAVIS: Say the thing, say the incantation!

00:58:04.079 --> 00:58:06.718
TALIESIN: Mecca lecca high, mecca hiney ho, don't
fuck me, Gil.

00:58:06.718 --> 00:58:08.284
MARISHA: Where are those pottery tools, Gil?

00:58:08.284 --> 00:58:09.798
TALIESIN: And those pottery tools are--

00:58:09.798 --> 00:58:11.427
MARISHA: (laughs) It's a good roll.

00:58:11.427 --> 00:58:12.232
TALIESIN: 22.

00:58:12.232 --> 00:58:18.115
MATT: 22. It takes you the better part of the next
two hours, but you manage to create some--

00:58:18.115 --> 00:58:23.534
TALIESIN: Thank you for helping me Ghost, by the
way. Never mind.

00:58:23.534 --> 00:58:26.547
MATT: They have to cool and harden, but in the
process of crafting it and heating it, you do have

00:58:26.547 --> 00:58:29.934
some decent ceramic plates that you think might
work. They're going to be fragile.

00:58:29.934 --> 00:58:31.735
TALIESIN: That's fine.

00:58:31.735 --> 00:58:34.874
MATT: Not like they'll crumble on their own
walking, but, if they take any sort of chip and

00:58:34.874 --> 00:58:36.543
damage the ceramic.

00:58:36.543 --> 00:58:38.072
TALIESIN: Hands and face is what I was hoping
for.

00:58:38.072 --> 00:58:41.846
MATT: I'll say the better part of two hours or so
to craft them, and then you begin to heat them in

00:58:41.846 --> 00:58:44.473
the kiln. It'll take you a while for them to
harden and set.

00:58:44.473 --> 00:58:48.022
TALIESIN: Okay, and we're just figuring out a
little easy armature that won't get in his way.

00:58:48.022 --> 00:58:50.016
And I'm peeking at him, seeing how he works--

00:58:50.016 --> 00:58:54.484
MATT: All right. The armature, roll tinker's kit.
Check. Proficiency plus dex.

00:58:54.484 --> 00:58:55.732
SAM: I'm going to-- oh, sorry.

00:58:55.732 --> 00:58:56.664
TALIESIN: You can assist.

00:58:56.664 --> 00:58:59.988
MATT: Actually, this would be proficiency plus
intellect, is what it would be, because this is

00:58:59.988 --> 00:59:02.295
trying to figure it out specifically.

00:59:02.295 --> 00:59:04.949
TALIESIN: I'd be happy for an assist, unless
you're doing something.

00:59:04.949 --> 00:59:07.688
SAM: I was going upstairs to ask one of the help
something.

00:59:07.688 --> 00:59:15.422
TALIESIN: Oh, go ahead, okay, that's fine. I'll
just work on your robot by myself, then. 21.

00:59:15.487 --> 00:59:19.189
MATT: Okay, easy enough to figure out a harness.
What are you doing, Tary?

00:59:19.189 --> 00:59:24.075
SAM: What was the servant's name who you said used
to have short hair, now long?

00:59:24.075 --> 00:59:25.977
MATT: Shayne.

00:59:25.977 --> 00:59:29.322
SAM: I go to her? Him?

00:59:29.322 --> 00:59:33.718
MATT: It's a her. She will punch you so hard.

00:59:33.718 --> 00:59:40.591
SAM: I offer to buy her hair for 100 gold pieces
to use as a wig.

00:59:40.747 --> 00:59:42.068
MATT: How do you say this?

00:59:42.068 --> 00:59:43.961
(all laugh)

00:59:43.961 --> 00:59:51.964
MATT: She's literally outside, sitting on the
outside wall of the gate, leaning forward, just on

00:59:51.964 --> 00:59:56.370
a stool, with a loaded crossbow over her lap,
looking out at the distance. And you're down

00:59:56.370 --> 00:59:58.009
below, about 20 feet down.

00:59:58.009 --> 00:59:59.279
SAM: You there, excuse me. Hello?

00:59:59.279 --> 01:00:01.629
MATT: She looks over the top. "Yeah?"

01:00:01.629 --> 01:00:05.770
SAM: Hi! Taryon Darrington. New member of the
group. Hi.

01:00:05.770 --> 01:00:07.144
MATT: "Hi."

01:00:07.144 --> 01:00:12.770
SAM: Yes, we're working on a very important
project. It's an undercover mission in a foreign

01:00:12.770 --> 01:00:20.260
land, and we're going to need a disguise.
Specifically, a wig, a convincing wig. We all

01:00:20.260 --> 01:00:26.778
thought that it might be a good idea to have some
real hair for this wig, and, well, you have

01:00:26.778 --> 01:00:34.314
beautiful hair. I wouldn't mind if you would lend
it to the cause. I'd like to

01:00:34.314 --> 01:00:36.242
buy your hair for 100 gold pieces.

01:00:36.242 --> 01:00:38.636
(all laugh)

01:00:38.636 --> 01:00:40.883
MATT: Go ahead and roll a persuasion check.

01:00:40.883 --> 01:00:43.445
LIAM: Oh my god, where's Shorthalt when you need
him?

01:00:43.445 --> 01:00:44.516
LAURA: Did he roll well?

01:00:44.516 --> 01:00:46.099
TALIESIN: I'm not saying.

01:00:46.099 --> 01:00:50.833
SAM: Persuasion? 24.

01:00:50.833 --> 01:00:56.996
MATT: She goes, "You're kidding me, right?"

01:00:56.996 --> 01:01:03.352
SAM: Oh, no, no, no. And I reach into my bag of
holding and pull out 100 gold and say, it would

01:01:03.352 --> 01:01:08.819
mean a lot to me and to my teammates if you would
cooperate in this mission.

01:01:08.819 --> 01:01:12.326
It might even save a life.

01:01:12.326 --> 01:01:24.686
MATT: She gives you this long, stern, dark look.
"(laughs) Make it 500 and you got a deal."

01:01:24.686 --> 01:01:27.725
SAM: 500? All right, fine.

01:01:27.725 --> 01:01:30.139
(all laugh)

01:01:30.139 --> 01:01:32.378
SAM: And a bargain at that.

01:01:32.378 --> 01:01:35.951
MATT: "Ah, it was getting too long, anyway." She
makes her way down the ladder and just walks past

01:01:35.951 --> 01:01:44.793
you into the keep. Comes back about half an hour
later, head completely shaved smooth, and she's

01:01:44.793 --> 01:01:53.753
got, in a little square of fabric, a cluster of
all of her red hair. She balls it up, comes over.

01:01:53.753 --> 01:01:59.950
SAM: A pleasure doing business with you. This
haircut might very well be the fate of the world,

01:01:59.950 --> 01:02:02.435
so thank you.

01:02:02.435 --> 01:02:03.548
MATT: "You're welcome."

01:02:03.548 --> 01:02:06.346
SAM: Here's your money.

01:02:06.346 --> 01:02:13.723
MATT: "Thank you. Here's your fucking hair. God
damn weirdo." And walks off and heads back to her

01:02:13.723 --> 01:02:14.756
perch at the top of the wall.

01:02:14.756 --> 01:02:15.868
SAM: Buy my book!

01:02:15.868 --> 01:02:23.518
(all laugh)

01:02:23.518 --> 01:02:26.715
MATT: Okay. You now have Shayne's hair--

01:02:26.715 --> 01:02:28.901
SAM: I'm going to try and make a wig out of it.

01:02:28.901 --> 01:02:29.709
MATT: Okay.

01:02:29.709 --> 01:02:30.730
SAM: Don't really know how.

01:02:30.730 --> 01:02:32.441
LAURA: It's just a bunch of pieces of hair.

01:02:32.441 --> 01:02:36.310
SAM: Glue? I've got alchemy, right? I can make,
like, goop?

01:02:36.310 --> 01:02:38.583
TALIESIN: You want a-- no, nope, I'm not helping.
Never mind. Don't want to help.

01:02:38.583 --> 01:02:39.496
MATT: You can. Do you want to do that?

01:02:39.496 --> 01:02:41.576
SAM: Make some goop. Some glue to put on it.

01:02:41.576 --> 01:02:48.571
MATT: We'll say, using the basis of a tanglefoot
bag, which is a very simple alchemical--

01:02:48.571 --> 01:02:51.656
SAM: Oh, it's got goo in it, yeah.

01:02:51.656 --> 01:02:53.787
TRAVIS: I mean, I can make a gallon of it.

01:02:53.787 --> 01:02:58.960
MATT: You begin to apply it to the top of Doty's
head, and begin to very carefully layer hair

01:02:58.960 --> 01:03:05.155
across it. I'm going to need-- let's see--
(laughs) I love you guys so much.

01:03:05.155 --> 01:03:08.323
LAURA: How long does goop last? Will Doty just
always have hair now?

01:03:08.323 --> 01:03:10.070
SAM: I mean, it's pretty sticky.

01:03:10.070 --> 01:03:11.135
LAURA: Gross.

01:03:11.135 --> 01:03:16.292
MATT: Go ahead and make-- just make a dexterity
check.

01:03:16.292 --> 01:03:23.053
SAM: Okay. Okay. Ooh. Not good. I'm feeling lucky.
17.

01:03:23.053 --> 01:03:37.503
MATT: 17. (laughs) So it looks a little Carrot
Toppy, but it works. These clusters of poofy red

01:03:37.503 --> 01:03:47.297
hair, but you layer it in a way that looks as good
as you can, given the fact that you glued hair to

01:03:47.297 --> 01:03:48.989
Doty's head.

01:03:48.989 --> 01:03:50.645
(all laugh)

01:03:50.645 --> 01:03:55.464
MATT: It could've gone a lot worse. From a
distance, this kind of looks like a person.

01:03:55.464 --> 01:03:57.164
SAM: I also gave him a little bit of--

01:03:57.164 --> 01:03:58.048
MATT: Little bit of goatee?

01:03:58.048 --> 01:03:59.072
SAM: Just to match me.

01:03:59.072 --> 01:04:01.861
MATT: Okay, yeah, great. You now have--

01:04:01.861 --> 01:04:04.551
TRAVIS: Do you mean the fu man, or did you give
him the full goatee?

01:04:04.551 --> 01:04:06.350
Because you just did the fu manchu.

01:04:06.350 --> 01:04:07.226
SAM: Probably just the fu man.

01:04:07.226 --> 01:04:08.445
MATT: All right, there you go.

01:04:08.445 --> 01:04:10.139
LAURA: But it's going to be covered by a mask.

01:04:10.139 --> 01:04:11.701
SAM: Oh, yeah. Oh, shit.

01:04:11.701 --> 01:04:15.104
MATT: You've crafted your own avatar.

01:04:15.104 --> 01:04:18.015
LIAM: Is the hair curly or straight?

01:04:18.015 --> 01:04:19.633
MATT: It's a little wavy.

01:04:19.633 --> 01:04:21.385
LIAM: Wavy, okay.

01:04:21.385 --> 01:04:25.839
MATT: Her hair had been short before, when it grew
out long, it came out a little wavy. So yeah, it

01:04:25.839 --> 01:04:35.237
has a little bit of a-- it looks like... What was
the actor's name? From Mask?

01:04:35.237 --> 01:04:37.986
ALL: Eric Stoltz?

01:04:37.986 --> 01:04:40.403
MATT: Kind of looks like that on Doty.

01:04:40.403 --> 01:04:43.515
TALIESIN: Critical Role, ladies and gentlemen.
Eric Stoltz. Google it.

01:04:43.515 --> 01:04:45.454
MARISHA: Cher was great in that.

01:04:45.454 --> 01:04:46.657
MATT: It's a great movie.

01:04:46.657 --> 01:04:48.660
LIAM: I thought you were going to go Ronald
McDonald, so that's a step up.

01:04:48.660 --> 01:04:53.111
MATT: Yeah, see? But that's kind of the texture
and the look of the hair, from what I recall it.

01:04:53.111 --> 01:04:54.680
SAM: Okay, we've set the stage.

01:04:54.680 --> 01:04:55.508
LAURA: Wow.

01:04:55.508 --> 01:04:56.847
SAM: Vax, bring us home.

01:04:56.847 --> 01:05:02.242
MATT: So, with the porcelain cooling off, Vax
comes back with the rest of the supplies.

01:05:02.242 --> 01:05:05.408
(all laugh)

01:05:05.408 --> 01:05:09.006
LIAM: Oh, good gods! What did you make, what did
you do?

01:05:09.006 --> 01:05:11.090
SAM: He's not just the president, he's a member,
too!

01:05:11.090 --> 01:05:12.584
(all laugh)

01:05:12.584 --> 01:05:19.670
MATT: What's fantastic, is he's glued the facial
hair before the porcelain mask was put on, so as

01:05:19.670 --> 01:05:21.817
Percy and Vax come in with their pieces--

01:05:21.817 --> 01:05:23.453
TALIESIN: All right, I've got the-- Oh, good God!

01:05:23.453 --> 01:05:25.236
LAURA: (laughs)

01:05:25.236 --> 01:05:27.293
LIAM: I mean, it's bad. It's really bad.

01:05:27.293 --> 01:05:29.732
TALIESIN: No, it's-- I mean, like, it's--

01:05:29.732 --> 01:05:34.783
LIAM: It's a start. I think the hair will actually
help the molding clay stay in place.

01:05:34.783 --> 01:05:36.249
TALIESIN: We're going to put a little wrap, it'll
be fine.

01:05:36.249 --> 01:05:37.348
SAM: And you've got hands?

01:05:37.348 --> 01:05:38.382
LIAM: (sighs)

01:05:38.382 --> 01:05:39.750
TALIESIN: Oh, yes, that too. Yes.

01:05:39.750 --> 01:05:42.462
SAM: Ah, excellent. Excellent.

01:05:42.462 --> 01:05:46.323
LIAM: All right. We collectively are Dr.
Frankenstein.

01:05:46.323 --> 01:05:47.088
LAURA: (laughs)

01:05:47.088 --> 01:05:47.990
MARISHA: Oh my gosh.

01:05:47.990 --> 01:05:48.840
LIAM: Let's make this happen.

01:05:48.840 --> 01:05:50.020
SAM: (laughs)

01:05:50.020 --> 01:05:55.066
MATT: Okay. So, you put on the harness. You get
the ceramic plates on that can loosely appear to

01:05:55.066 --> 01:06:00.128
be smoother, and a little more of a general
curvature to the joints, so that it looks more

01:06:00.128 --> 01:06:06.543
natural from a distance. You put on the-- The mask
of porcelain that you made, I mean, you know, the

01:06:06.543 --> 01:06:10.076
facial hair that's underneath and is on Doty's
face is going to be under the mask.

01:06:10.076 --> 01:06:12.054
TALIESIN: Yes. Thank God.

01:06:12.054 --> 01:06:13.970
MATT: You could attempt to remove it, if you'd
like.

01:06:13.970 --> 01:06:15.615
LIAM: No, I think that'll help--

01:06:15.615 --> 01:06:16.477
TALIESIN: No, no.

01:06:16.477 --> 01:06:17.214
SAM: No. We'll leave it.

01:06:17.214 --> 01:06:18.603
LIAM: -- it'll help hold all it in place.

01:06:18.603 --> 01:06:19.551
SAM: Just a little glue to help stick it there.

01:06:19.551 --> 01:06:22.135
TALIESIN: In case we're in combat and it comes
out, maybe we'll get, like, a momentary element of

01:06:22.135 --> 01:06:24.132
surprise as they go, 'My God, what is that?'

01:06:24.132 --> 01:06:28.397
MATT: Plus it's just good to know that, at any
given point in time, Doty now has a secret goatee.

01:06:28.397 --> 01:06:32.553
(all laugh)

01:06:32.553 --> 01:06:33.745
MATT: That only you know about.

01:06:33.745 --> 01:06:36.107
SAM: I had extra hair, I wanted to use it.

01:06:36.107 --> 01:06:38.051
TALIESIN, MATT, and MARISHA: #secretgoatee.

01:06:38.051 --> 01:06:41.477
(all laugh)

01:06:41.477 --> 01:06:44.280
TALIESIN: What is this episode? What--

01:06:44.280 --> 01:06:45.285
LIAM: Oh my God.

01:06:45.285 --> 01:06:47.071
MARISHA: This is the worst thing!

01:06:47.071 --> 01:06:51.213
MATT: All right. Play 'em home, keyboard cat. Roll
a disguise kit.

01:06:51.213 --> 01:06:52.732
LIAM: Oh, all right. I'm going to try to make this
a--

01:06:52.732 --> 01:06:54.719
TRAVIS: (keyboard sounds)

01:06:54.719 --> 01:06:57.708
LIAM: What number do I use for the disguise kit?
Dexterity?

01:06:57.708 --> 01:07:02.738
MATT: No, this would be-- hold on, the toolkit
here-- with you it would be--

01:07:02.738 --> 01:07:04.019
Yeah, because it is--

01:07:04.019 --> 01:07:05.044
LIAM: Because I'm a rogue.

01:07:05.044 --> 01:07:07.006
MATT: It's how nimble your fingers are. It's a
dexterity bonus plus the proficiency modifier for

01:07:07.006 --> 01:07:10.253
a disguise kit. If you are proficient with this
kit, with the disguise kit?

01:07:10.253 --> 01:07:11.441
LIAM: Oh, my gods.

01:07:11.441 --> 01:07:12.532
MATT: What are your proficiencies?

01:07:12.532 --> 01:07:14.624
LIAM: I don't think so. I mean, I don't know, so
I'm just going to say no.

01:07:14.624 --> 01:07:15.552
MATT: Then it's just dexterity.

01:07:15.552 --> 01:07:16.444
LIAM: Dexterity.

01:07:16.444 --> 01:07:17.527
MATT: Just roll a d20, add your dex bonus.

01:07:17.527 --> 01:07:22.082
LIAM: Okay. All right, I'm going to go for like, a
General Krieg-type look to the face? I'm going to

01:07:22.082 --> 01:07:22.939
do my best--

01:07:22.939 --> 01:07:23.712
MATT: Okay.

01:07:23.712 --> 01:07:25.412
LIAM: -- to redheaded General Krieg?

01:07:25.412 --> 01:07:26.137
LAURA: Nice.

01:07:26.137 --> 01:07:27.200
MATT: Okay.

01:07:27.200 --> 01:07:30.131
LIAM: Okay, here we go. I'm going to use Luck.

01:07:30.131 --> 01:07:31.073
LAURA: (laughs)

01:07:31.073 --> 01:07:31.962
LIAM: I'm going to use Luck.

01:07:31.962 --> 01:07:32.839
MATT: (laughs) Are you sure?

01:07:32.839 --> 01:07:33.528
LIAM: Yeah.

01:07:33.528 --> 01:07:34.190
MATT: Are you sure?

01:07:34.190 --> 01:07:34.971
LAURA: Are you sure?

01:07:34.971 --> 01:07:36.069
LIAM: I'm quite sure. Natural 20!

01:07:36.069 --> 01:07:37.085
LAURA: Oh my God.

01:07:37.085 --> 01:07:40.022
(all cheer)

01:07:40.022 --> 01:07:41.712
LIAM: General Krieg, it's good to see ya!

01:07:41.712 --> 01:07:48.243
MATT: In spite of the absurdity of what you've
managed to accomplish with the better part of your

01:07:48.243 --> 01:07:53.484
day, as the sun is now setting, and the rest of
you have been wondering what the fuck is going on

01:07:53.484 --> 01:08:00.791
down there, you manage to build some semblance of
a muscular structure underneath the robes. And

01:08:00.791 --> 01:08:09.253
amongst the porcelain mask that Percy had set as a
base, you have crafted texture, color, it looks

01:08:09.253 --> 01:08:11.079
kind of like a face.

01:08:11.079 --> 01:08:12.777
TALIESIN: It looks like Lincoln from Disneyland!

01:08:12.777 --> 01:08:13.776
(all laugh)

01:08:13.776 --> 01:08:16.590
MATT: It does! It looks like a shitty animatronic.
Which means--

01:08:16.590 --> 01:08:18.456
SAM: I was the sixteenth president.

01:08:18.456 --> 01:08:19.324
(all laugh)

01:08:19.324 --> 01:08:20.469
MATT: Like, it really does.

01:08:20.469 --> 01:08:21.344
LIAM: Yeah.

01:08:21.344 --> 01:08:23.714
MATT: Like, not a good Disney animatronic. Like,
state fair animatronic.

01:08:23.714 --> 01:08:24.326
MARISHA: Sure.

01:08:24.326 --> 01:08:24.938
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:08:24.938 --> 01:08:26.353
TALIESIN, LIAM, and LAURA: Chuck E. Cheese.

01:08:26.353 --> 01:08:28.020
MATT: Yeah. This has been through a few fires.

01:08:28.020 --> 01:08:29.226
MARISHA: Yeah, I was just going to say, been
through a fire!

01:08:29.226 --> 01:08:30.394
TRAVIS: (animatronic sounds)

01:08:30.394 --> 01:08:35.728
MATT: Yeah, it's Bonnie Springs. It's straight-up
Bonnie Springs. But, given the circumstances, not

01:08:35.728 --> 01:08:36.672
too bad!

01:08:36.672 --> 01:08:38.205
TALIESIN: Boys, I'm so proud of both of you.

01:08:38.205 --> 01:08:41.904
LIAM: Guys, art is subjective, all right? Put
clothes on top of this thing and

01:08:41.904 --> 01:08:43.501
we're golden, I think.

01:08:43.501 --> 01:08:45.242
LAURA: #BrianFosterSmellsLikeCabbage.

01:08:45.242 --> 01:08:47.465
(all laugh)

01:08:47.465 --> 01:08:51.141
LIAM: Happy St. Patrick's Day, everybody!

01:08:51.141 --> 01:08:53.833
TALIESIN: I'm quite pleased. I'm quite pleased.

01:08:53.833 --> 01:09:02.136
SAM: I didn't think that Doty could be improved,
but you all impressed me today. Thank you. Thank

01:09:02.136 --> 01:09:03.068
you for this.

01:09:03.068 --> 01:09:03.967
TALIESIN: Good work, everybody.

01:09:03.967 --> 01:09:04.717
SAM: Good work.

01:09:04.717 --> 01:09:05.510
TALIESIN: Good work, everybody.

01:09:05.510 --> 01:09:06.323
SAM: Yes.

01:09:06.323 --> 01:09:07.073
LIAM: Good teamwork.

01:09:07.073 --> 01:09:07.730
SAM: Teamwork!

01:09:07.730 --> 01:09:08.463
LIAM: Yeah.

01:09:08.463 --> 01:09:10.396
SAM: Yes! Feels good to say it!

01:09:10.396 --> 01:09:14.562
LIAM: Well, good work.

01:09:16.609 --> 01:09:17.773
SAM: Shall we go to Vasselheim?

01:09:17.773 --> 01:09:19.836
MARISHA: Yeah, let's go.

01:09:19.836 --> 01:09:21.071
TALIESIN: Grog?

01:09:21.071 --> 01:09:22.885
TRAVIS: And I'll come down.

01:09:22.885 --> 01:09:23.833
TALIESIN: Grog!

01:09:23.833 --> 01:09:24.904
LAURA: What have you been doing up there?

01:09:24.904 --> 01:09:27.046
TRAVIS: Is that General Krieg? (screams)

01:09:27.046 --> 01:09:28.606
(all laugh)

01:09:28.606 --> 01:09:29.503
TALIESIN: It's all right! It's all right!

01:09:29.503 --> 01:09:30.938
SAM: No, no, no!

01:09:30.938 --> 01:09:33.795
TALIESIN: It's very expensive, don't break it.

01:09:33.795 --> 01:09:38.562
TRAVIS: Why have you aligned yourself with this
creature?

01:09:38.562 --> 01:09:41.174
LIAM: I knock on the side of its head.

01:09:41.174 --> 01:09:43.399
SAM: (hollow metal knocking sounds)

01:09:43.399 --> 01:09:44.506
LIAM: That's not Krieg.

01:09:44.506 --> 01:09:46.084
LAURA: It's Dootie.

01:09:46.084 --> 01:09:51.529
TRAVIS: No. Dootie did not have fire crotch hair.
He did not have a face or hands--

01:09:51.529 --> 01:09:52.464
SAM: Did you say 'fire crotch'?

01:09:52.464 --> 01:09:53.441
TALIESIN: Yes, he did.

01:09:53.441 --> 01:09:54.715
TRAVIS: --or a cloak. He didn't have any of that
stuff.

01:09:54.715 --> 01:09:57.554
LIAM: Yeah, but Grog, we glued it on. We Dorked
with it.

01:09:57.554 --> 01:10:00.315
TRAVIS: Oh, he's wearing a disguise! Yes.

01:10:00.315 --> 01:10:01.139
LIAM: Yes, he's a disguised robot.

01:10:01.139 --> 01:10:01.956
TRAVIS: Who did that?

01:10:01.956 --> 01:10:02.735
TALIESIN: Oh, all of us.

01:10:02.735 --> 01:10:04.009
TRAVIS: As a team?

01:10:04.009 --> 01:10:04.772
MARISHA: Mainly these three--

01:10:04.772 --> 01:10:05.722
LIAM: Mostly Keyleth.

01:10:05.722 --> 01:10:06.398
TRAVIS: Right.

01:10:06.398 --> 01:10:09.993
MATT: It occurs to you guys, you don't know where
the hair came from.

01:10:09.993 --> 01:10:11.593
LIAM: What?

01:10:11.593 --> 01:10:13.184
MARISHA: Druidcraft.

01:10:13.184 --> 01:10:13.898
TRAVIS: Wow.

01:10:13.898 --> 01:10:14.658
TALIESIN: Wow, well done.

01:10:14.658 --> 01:10:16.254
LIAM: Got all your hair--

01:10:16.254 --> 01:10:17.775
TRAVIS: Could you do that to me?

01:10:17.775 --> 01:10:19.785
TALIESIN: Where did you get the hair?

01:10:19.785 --> 01:10:20.659
LIAM: Where is the hair from?

01:10:20.659 --> 01:10:21.710
TALIESIN: What is it?

01:10:21.710 --> 01:10:24.527
SAM: I've got some tricks up my sleeve. (laughs)

01:10:24.527 --> 01:10:27.350
LIAM: Did you pull it like a patch off and it
turns into a bunch of hair?

01:10:27.350 --> 01:10:28.947
SAM: Maybe. Maybe I did.

01:10:28.947 --> 01:10:30.183
LIAM: God, magic is amazing.

01:10:30.183 --> 01:10:32.715
LAURA: Did you get glue all over my robe that I
put on him?

01:10:32.715 --> 01:10:34.312
SAM: Maybe. Maybe I did.

01:10:34.312 --> 01:10:35.969
MATT: Make a perception check.

01:10:35.969 --> 01:10:38.837
LAURA: Oh, motherfucker.

01:10:38.837 --> 01:10:41.682
LIAM: That'll do all right.

01:10:43.014 --> 01:10:44.805
LAURA: 24.

01:10:44.805 --> 01:10:45.783
MATT: (singsong) That robe is ruined.

01:10:45.783 --> 01:10:47.883
LAURA: Oh no! It's not ruined!

01:10:47.883 --> 01:10:51.880
MATT: (laughs) Certainly. Elements of it are
permanently glued to Doty.

01:10:51.880 --> 01:10:55.314
MARISHA: Oh, I think this is your hair-dying robe
now. Sorry.

01:10:55.314 --> 01:10:57.508
LAURA: That was my stealth robe.

01:10:57.508 --> 01:10:58.828
MARISHA: And now your--

01:10:58.828 --> 01:11:01.170
SAM: And will be once more, I'll have it cleaned
and pressed for you.

01:11:01.170 --> 01:11:02.007
LIAM: Wait there's glue on the--

01:11:02.007 --> 01:11:03.164
TALIESIN: That's the stealth robe?

01:11:03.164 --> 01:11:06.176
LIAM: -- on the elven cloak? Oh.

01:11:06.176 --> 01:11:07.261
TALIESIN: Oh.

01:11:07.261 --> 01:11:08.298
MARISHA: Does that mean that the--

01:11:08.298 --> 01:11:09.959
SAM: It's a magical item you put on?

01:11:09.959 --> 01:11:11.744
LAURA: (laughs nervously) Yes.

01:11:11.744 --> 01:11:12.875
TALIESIN: You put a magical item on the robot?!

01:11:12.875 --> 01:11:14.159
LAURA: That's the only robe I fucking had!

01:11:14.159 --> 01:11:16.617
TALIESIN: (laughs)

01:11:16.617 --> 01:11:17.424
TRAVIS: Wow.

01:11:17.424 --> 01:11:18.155
LIAM: Oh, that--

01:11:18.155 --> 01:11:19.025
TRAVIS: For nothing.

01:11:19.025 --> 01:11:20.787
LAURA: (shouts) I didn't know you were going to
glue it to him!

01:11:20.787 --> 01:11:22.228
LIAM: Much sentimental value--

01:11:22.228 --> 01:11:23.468
LAURA: (shouts) I know!

01:11:23.468 --> 01:11:25.650
TALIESIN: Now there's a robot with sentimental
value.

01:11:25.650 --> 01:11:29.840
LIAM: It's all right, you're still alive.
Whoop-dee-doo. Let's just do the thing, come on.

01:11:29.840 --> 01:11:35.188
MARISHA: You're right, now that I've blurred my
vision, the glue is the most noticeable part.

01:11:35.188 --> 01:11:37.161
MATT: (laughs)

01:11:37.161 --> 01:11:39.633
TALIESIN: I think it blends into the texture,
actually, quite nice.

01:11:39.633 --> 01:11:41.050
Makes it look like he's seen some shit.

01:11:41.050 --> 01:11:43.199
LAURA: Motherfucker! Let's go to Vasselheim.

01:11:43.199 --> 01:11:44.029
TRAVIS: Yeah, let's go.

01:11:44.029 --> 01:11:45.592
MATT: Okay.

01:11:45.592 --> 01:11:47.464
TALIESIN: I'll buy you a new robe.

01:11:47.464 --> 01:11:52.494
MATT: Doty's been standing there, and as soon as
you guys say let's go and Doty starts moving, it has

01:11:52.494 --> 01:11:55.605
this scary Return to Oz feel to it--

01:11:55.662 --> 01:12:00.357
LAURA: Ew. I like it.

01:12:00.357 --> 01:12:01.436
TALIESIN: This is everything I've ever wanted.

01:12:01.436 --> 01:12:03.691
MATT: (Doty walking sounds)

01:12:03.691 --> 01:12:04.843
LIAM: Oh, man.

01:12:04.843 --> 01:12:06.940
MARISHA: Hey, where did you learn contouring?

01:12:06.940 --> 01:12:08.602
LIAM: What--

01:12:08.602 --> 01:12:10.917
MARISHA: (laughs) Because that's really well
done.

01:12:10.917 --> 01:12:13.594
LIAM: You've seen what I can do with hair, right?
I mean, are you really surprised?

01:12:13.594 --> 01:12:14.980
MARISHA: Good point, let's go.

01:12:14.980 --> 01:12:16.071
MATT: It's the elvish half.

01:12:16.071 --> 01:12:16.955
MARISHA: It's the elvish half.

01:12:16.955 --> 01:12:18.907
TRAVIS: It's the elvish half.

01:12:18.907 --> 01:12:20.244
LIAM: Clasp time, Clasp time.

01:12:20.244 --> 01:12:25.286
MATT: Yeah. All right, so. You go ahead and head
up to the Temple of Sarenrae within your keep,

01:12:25.286 --> 01:12:29.541
there is the central tree there. You go ahead and
Transport via Plants to--

01:12:29.541 --> 01:12:31.094
MATT and MARISHA: Vasselheim!

01:12:31.094 --> 01:12:32.336
MATT: Where in Vasselheim do you want to exit?

01:12:32.336 --> 01:12:35.104
MARISHA: And we have the book? We have the book in
the chest? Chest and the book?

01:12:35.104 --> 01:12:36.162
TALIESIN: We have the book.

01:12:36.162 --> 01:12:37.010
MARISHA: All right.

01:12:37.010 --> 01:12:38.812
LAURA: Not the chest, but in the bag of holding.

01:12:38.812 --> 01:12:40.048
TALIESIN: But we have the book. Yeah.

01:12:40.048 --> 01:12:41.035
LAURA: Wrapped in cloth.

01:12:41.035 --> 01:12:46.188
MARISHA: Where? Wasn't there the tree that was
near the Slayer's Take?

01:12:46.188 --> 01:12:48.373
MATT: There is one, yeah, there's one that patches
there.

01:12:48.373 --> 01:12:49.287
MARISHA: Yeah. We'll do that.

01:12:49.287 --> 01:12:50.833
MATT: Okay, so you use that one.

01:12:50.833 --> 01:12:52.335
LIAM: Let's use that save point.

01:12:52.335 --> 01:12:57.137
MARISHA: Yeah. What do they call it? Never mind.

01:12:57.137 --> 01:12:58.169
MATT: Okay.

01:12:58.169 --> 01:12:58.974
LAURA: Waypoint.

01:12:58.974 --> 01:13:00.843
MARISHA: There! Yes, thank you.

01:13:00.843 --> 01:13:04.534
TRAVIS: The waypoint.

01:13:04.534 --> 01:13:14.490
MATT: So, as you guys emerge it is still early
afternoon in Vasselheim. The sun is just setting

01:13:14.490 --> 01:13:19.799
in your location, you guys have travelled far
northwest at this point when it was still midday.

01:13:19.799 --> 01:13:24.194
You emerge roughly in the center of the Quad Roads,
a little bit north-center area of the Quad Roads.

01:13:24.252 --> 01:13:27.679
What are you looking for?

01:13:27.679 --> 01:13:30.519
LAURA: Well, we should go--

01:13:30.519 --> 01:13:31.488
TALIESIN: Library.

01:13:31.488 --> 01:13:32.431
LAURA: Yes, the library.

01:13:32.431 --> 01:13:33.653
LIAM: Library.

01:13:33.653 --> 01:13:38.166
LAURA: We delivered the horn of Orcus to the
Platinum Dragon.

01:13:38.166 --> 01:13:39.314
MATT: Yeah, the Platinum Sanctuary.

01:13:39.314 --> 01:13:41.486
LAURA: Yes. So we should probably go talk to them
as well.

01:13:41.486 --> 01:13:46.248
MARISHA: Because I imagine they'd have a good
hiding place?

01:13:46.248 --> 01:13:48.255
TALIESIN: It's where I'd put the Ark of the
Covenant, certainly.

01:13:48.313 --> 01:13:50.174
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:13:50.174 --> 01:13:53.009
LAURA: And also to talk to them about Orcus.

01:13:53.009 --> 01:13:54.065
MARISHA: Correct.

01:13:54.065 --> 01:13:55.010
LAURA: Since that's--

01:13:55.010 --> 01:13:57.181
MARISHA: And then shops for more potions.

01:13:57.181 --> 01:14:02.600
LIAM: Do we want to split up? You want to go talk
Orcus?

01:14:02.600 --> 01:14:03.971
MARISHA: That's actually not a bad plan.

01:14:03.971 --> 01:14:05.217
LAURA: Yeah. Sure.

01:14:05.217 --> 01:14:08.575
MARISHA: Okay. You're going to go research Orcus?

01:14:08.575 --> 01:14:09.430
LIAM: Yeah.

01:14:09.430 --> 01:14:10.340
MARISHA: The twins?

01:14:10.340 --> 01:14:11.002
LIAM: Yeah.

01:14:11.002 --> 01:14:13.442
MARISHA: All right. Percy, you want to go to the
Platinum Reserve?

01:14:13.442 --> 01:14:14.988
TALIESIN: Always.

01:14:14.988 --> 01:14:20.614
MARISHA: All right. We'll take the book. Tary? You
want to come with us or the twins?

01:14:20.614 --> 01:14:22.101
SAM: With you, absolutely.

01:14:22.101 --> 01:14:23.428
MARISHA: All right. Grog?

01:14:23.428 --> 01:14:25.659
TRAVIS: Ugh, god, the options both suck.

01:14:25.659 --> 01:14:29.465
(all laugh)

01:14:29.465 --> 01:14:30.507
TRAVIS: Fuck!

01:14:30.507 --> 01:14:32.022
TALIESIN: Go with the twins, they're more inclined
to violence.

01:14:32.022 --> 01:14:33.891
LAURA: Oh, Grog could also go learn about the Nine
Hells!

01:14:33.891 --> 01:14:36.237
TRAVIS: No, no no. Okay, wait. Books?

01:14:36.237 --> 01:14:36.753
LAURA: Yeah.

01:14:36.753 --> 01:14:38.784
TRAVIS: Nope. What are you doing?

01:14:38.784 --> 01:14:41.037
MARISHA: Books.

01:14:41.037 --> 01:14:43.717
TRAVIS: No. I'm doing my own thing.

01:14:43.717 --> 01:14:45.080
LIAM: We're gonna go learn about scary
things, though.

01:14:45.080 --> 01:14:48.983
SAM: I've been wanting to buy some potions and
things, is that an option here?

01:14:49.223 --> 01:14:51.628
MARISHA: Oh, do you want to be team potions?

01:14:51.628 --> 01:14:53.364
TALIESIN: And buying things? You like buying
things.

01:14:53.364 --> 01:14:55.227
MARISHA: Team Shopping, right Grog?

01:14:55.227 --> 01:14:56.338
LAURA: Tary-- Tary!

01:14:56.338 --> 01:14:57.797
MATT: Grog's really good at buying potions.

01:14:57.797 --> 01:14:59.542
LAURA: Tary-- I pull Tary aside.

01:14:59.542 --> 01:15:00.616
SAM: Yes, what?

01:15:00.616 --> 01:15:06.407
LAURA: If you're going to go shopping with Grog
you need to know-- don't look at him. He is

01:15:06.407 --> 01:15:07.732
terrible with money.

01:15:07.732 --> 01:15:08.796
TALIESIN: I can't look away.

01:15:08.796 --> 01:15:16.450
LAURA: Tary, he's terrible with money. I mean
like, he will offer them-- stop it! He will offer

01:15:16.450 --> 01:15:20.267
them double what they ask for.

01:15:20.267 --> 01:15:26.123
SAM: Oh. And that's not good? Don't worry, I've
been raised around money,

01:15:26.123 --> 01:15:28.796
I know its worth. I have--

01:15:28.796 --> 01:15:29.550
LAURA: I'm just saying--

01:15:29.550 --> 01:15:32.374
SAM: -- at least six trust funds and they're all
managed quite well.

01:15:32.374 --> 01:15:35.306
LAURA: (deadpan) I'm so happy for you.

01:15:35.306 --> 01:15:36.592
LIAM: Tru-- what?

01:15:36.592 --> 01:15:39.364
LAURA: Just keep an eye on him, all right?

01:15:39.364 --> 01:15:44.173
SAM: I will receive your trust.

01:15:44.173 --> 01:15:46.446
LAURA: (sighs)

01:15:46.446 --> 01:15:51.322
SAM: And I will fulfill your request as a fellow
member of this team.

01:15:51.322 --> 01:15:52.953
LAURA: (strained) Fabulous.

01:15:52.953 --> 01:15:54.922
SAM: Thank you for entrusting me with this
mission.

01:15:54.922 --> 01:15:58.891
TALIESIN: Thank you, Tary, good luck. Grog, keep
an eye on him, make sure that everything's--

01:15:58.891 --> 01:16:00.222
TRAVIS: Oh, I will.

01:16:00.222 --> 01:16:03.133
LIAM: As they leave, I spank Grog hard on the ass
and say, money was meant to be spent!

01:16:03.133 --> 01:16:05.199
LAURA: (laughs)

01:16:05.199 --> 01:16:06.879
TRAVIS: I like that twin.

01:16:06.879 --> 01:16:12.457
MATT: (laughs) All right, you scatter into three
different directions. First--

01:16:12.457 --> 01:16:14.262
MARISHA: To the library?

01:16:14.262 --> 01:16:15.172
MATT: All right.

01:16:15.172 --> 01:16:16.474
LAURA: No, you were going to the Platinum
Sanctuary.

01:16:16.474 --> 01:16:17.662
TRAVIS: Yeah, Jesus. (laughs)

01:16:17.662 --> 01:16:18.614
LAURA: We're going to the library.

01:16:18.614 --> 01:16:21.910
MARISHA: Which is to the place where they--

01:16:21.910 --> 01:16:23.357
TRAVIS: Holy shit.

01:16:23.357 --> 01:16:24.547
TALIESIN: Archive.

01:16:24.547 --> 01:16:26.927
MARISHA: (shouts) To the archive!

01:16:26.927 --> 01:16:29.928
SAM: Did you guys both say goodbye and then you're
walking the same direction?

01:16:29.928 --> 01:16:32.651
MATT: Yep! Yeah.

01:16:32.651 --> 01:16:34.507
TRAVIS: Oh, you're parked over here, too? Oh,
okay, cool.

01:16:34.507 --> 01:16:36.091
TALIESIN: I'm tired-- okay, this is awkward now,
we'll just keep--

01:16:36.091 --> 01:16:38.043
MARISHA: They're right next door, they're
connected, they're partners.

01:16:38.043 --> 01:16:41.369
LIAM: Well some people go this way, and some
people go that way and some people go both ways!

01:16:41.369 --> 01:16:44.378
MATT: (laughs) All right, so you guys make your
way up to the Platinum Sanctuary, you head to the

01:16:44.378 --> 01:16:50.662
base of the central mountain that the north end of
Vasselheim is built around, to the winding stair

01:16:50.662 --> 01:16:57.993
that leads up to the Sanctuary proper. There, as
you ascend, you can see the sun is getting to the

01:16:57.993 --> 01:17:04.746
three to four o'clock in the afternoon position.
The color of the sky's starting to turn a bit

01:17:04.746 --> 01:17:12.153
different. You guys make your way to the outside
doors of the Sanctuary, where you see the guards

01:17:12.153 --> 01:17:18.980
are there, stationed, and as you approach, some of
them put up a bit of an aggressive front from a

01:17:18.980 --> 01:17:22.856
defensive standpoint, but one of them does
recognise you and approaches, pulls the front of

01:17:22.856 --> 01:17:28.544
his helmet up. "You are Vox Machina."

01:17:28.544 --> 01:17:30.663
LAURA: We are.

01:17:30.663 --> 01:17:33.187
MATT: "What business do you have here at the
Platinum Sanctuary?"

01:17:33.187 --> 01:17:40.894
LAURA: We have come to discuss the (whispers) Horn
of Orcus that we delivered here a while ago.

01:17:40.894 --> 01:17:48.378
MATT: "So you request an audience with Scalebearer
Vord?"

01:17:48.435 --> 01:17:49.601
LAURA: Mm-hm.

01:17:49.601 --> 01:17:52.009
LIAM: Yeah. That guy.

01:17:54.303 --> 01:17:55.992
TRAVIS: The sphinx's name.

01:17:55.992 --> 01:17:57.041
LAURA: What?

01:17:57.041 --> 01:17:58.195
TRAVIS: The sphinx's name.

01:17:58.195 --> 01:17:59.419
LAURA: I don't remember.

01:17:59.419 --> 01:18:03.335
MATT: (laughs) All righty. Highbearer Vord. He
says, "Very well. Please to be patient, I believe

01:18:03.335 --> 01:18:04.350
"he is busy."

01:18:04.350 --> 01:18:05.239
LAURA: Oh. Right.

01:18:05.239 --> 01:18:07.273
MATT: And he heads inside, the doors close
behind.

01:18:07.273 --> 01:18:12.860
LAURA: As he does that, I look to Vax and go, hey,
I have an idea. So the book we have, right?

01:18:12.860 --> 01:18:13.805
LIAM: Mm?

01:18:13.805 --> 01:18:18.754
LAURA: What if instead of leaving it here, we left
it at the Raven Queen's sanctuary? Don't you think

01:18:18.754 --> 01:18:25.165
they would keep it more safe? Because she hates
undead, right? This is like her nemesis, right?

01:18:25.165 --> 01:18:34.766
LIAM: She does. Yeah, I mean, that's a whole
thing, I don't think that's a bad idea, but I feel

01:18:34.766 --> 01:18:37.495
like if I go there, I need to stay for a bit.

01:18:37.495 --> 01:18:38.498
LAURA: Oh, really?

01:18:38.498 --> 01:18:39.733
LIAM: Yeah.

01:18:39.733 --> 01:18:41.225
LAURA: Do you want to do that?

01:18:41.225 --> 01:18:44.251
LIAM: No, not yet.

01:18:44.251 --> 01:18:46.762
LAURA: All right, cool. Let's forget I mentioned
anything.

01:18:46.762 --> 01:18:49.460
LIAM: Let's do that.

01:18:49.460 --> 01:18:51.589
LAURA: All right.

01:18:52.390 --> 01:18:57.087
MATT: All right. About 15 minutes or so pass
as you guys are led up. It's a gorgeous view

01:18:57.146 --> 01:19:05.615
from up here, by the way, I mean, for Vasselheim,
the cloud cover is probably 70 to 80% of the year,

01:19:05.615 --> 01:19:11.129
with coming storms and sleet. This is one of the
few days you've been during this part of the

01:19:11.129 --> 01:19:18.708
season where the sky is open. You actually see
some blue in the sky, and as the light of the day

01:19:18.768 --> 01:19:24.737
begins to grow more towards a dusk color you start
seeing the distant change and it's just endless

01:19:24.737 --> 01:19:30.944
thick, dense forest of the Vesper Timberland all
around the city. And so there's kind of this

01:19:30.944 --> 01:19:32.595
serene waiting period as well.

01:19:32.595 --> 01:19:34.504
LAURA: I just lean against Trinket.

01:19:34.504 --> 01:19:40.483
MATT: Trinket just (bear noises). You calm Trinket
a bit. Trinket doesn't like heights and is up here

01:19:40.483 --> 01:19:45.785
on this platform, it's literally like a very small
rail and then it drops probably a good 150, 200

01:19:45.785 --> 01:19:51.875
feet down, and so Trinket's just like staying as
far away from the edge as possible. Eventually the

01:19:51.875 --> 01:19:58.330
doors shift and one side opens up slightly, the
same guard walks out. "All right, very well.

01:19:58.330 --> 01:20:06.247
"Follow me." Turns around. Leads you in. He's
carrying his large, very well-polished tower

01:20:06.247 --> 01:20:10.699
shield to his side, he still has his helmet visor
up. Leads you into the central structure.

01:20:10.699 --> 01:20:13.241
LAURA: Do we know what we're going to say?

01:20:13.241 --> 01:20:21.646
LIAM: We're going to talk about the book. We're
going to ask them if they can destroy it.

01:20:21.646 --> 01:20:24.676
LAURA: Or hold it, right? Do something with it.

01:20:24.676 --> 01:20:26.572
LIAM: Preferably destroy.

01:20:26.572 --> 01:20:31.524
LAURA: Okay. It's history, though.

01:20:31.524 --> 01:20:35.421
LIAM: It's dangerous.

01:20:35.421 --> 01:20:37.796
LAURA: True.

01:20:37.796 --> 01:20:43.514
MATT: You guys are led to the audience chamber.
Surrounded by the wide den of pillars and the

01:20:43.514 --> 01:20:46.515
central area has a hole above the top of the
temple where the light comes through and there you

01:20:46.515 --> 01:20:54.015
see, stepping in hurriedly from the opposite side,
flanked by two advisors is Highbearer Vord, the

01:20:54.015 --> 01:21:00.285
Silver Touched. You see his elven form is very
fine-featured, his skin still very pale, almost

01:21:00.285 --> 01:21:11.020
pearlescent when the light hits it and his robes
flow behind him, dragging a good four or five feet

01:21:11.020 --> 01:21:16.134
across the center. It's such an open space between
the circular pillars that hold this-- it's just

01:21:16.134 --> 01:21:21.068
this tiny image of him approaching you amongst
this wide-open space with his two advisors. As the

01:21:21.068 --> 01:21:26.379
footsteps get louder and louder as he approaches.
"So yes, you've summoned me,

01:21:26.379 --> 01:21:28.666
"what is your business?"

01:21:28.666 --> 01:21:32.531
LAURA: Didn't mean to summon you, Scalebearer, I
know your time is precious.

01:21:32.531 --> 01:21:33.839
MATT: "Yes."

01:21:33.839 --> 01:21:41.035
LAURA: We however came across, in fighting the
Chroma Conclave and defeating them, this book

01:21:41.035 --> 01:21:50.885
which references Opash's search into necromancy.
NecromANcy? NecrOmancy.

01:21:50.885 --> 01:21:51.783
SAM: NecrOmancy.

01:21:51.783 --> 01:21:52.822
MATT: NecrOmancy. Josh NecrOmancy?

01:21:52.822 --> 01:21:54.712
LIAM: NECromancy.

01:21:54.712 --> 01:21:56.040
LAURA: Necrome-- yes.

01:21:56.040 --> 01:21:56.818
TRAVIS: Necromé?

01:21:56.818 --> 01:21:58.005
LAURA: Necromé.

01:21:58.005 --> 01:22:01.295
LIAM: (laughs) Does that name mean anything to
you?

01:22:01.295 --> 01:22:11.330
MATT: "I have read of it, yes. I mean, it's a
creature of lore. Opash was before the Divergence,

01:22:11.383 --> 01:22:17.572
"even. If you indeed found a tome that once
belonged to him, this is of much interest to us

01:22:17.572 --> 01:22:21.874
"and our network of researchers."

01:22:21.949 --> 01:22:23.843
LIAM: Research?

01:22:23.843 --> 01:22:25.261
LAURA: Researchers.

01:22:25.261 --> 01:22:27.182
MATT: "Well, yes."

01:22:27.182 --> 01:22:29.589
LAURA: It's an evil tome.

01:22:29.589 --> 01:22:32.905
MATT: "I can only assume it is, you are right."

01:22:34.147 --> 01:22:46.681
LIAM: We came to Vasselheim to dispose of it. My
sister has read it. Parts of it, and--

01:22:46.681 --> 01:22:49.022
LAURA: (whispers) All of it.

01:22:49.022 --> 01:22:54.774
LIAM: It's foul. It should not be allowed to
exist.

01:22:54.774 --> 01:23:01.996
MATT: "We can ensure that it falls into no hands
beyond this temple. However, we do have to

01:23:01.996 --> 01:23:07.947
"research the contents, you understand. The
necessity of understanding the evils and darkness

01:23:07.947 --> 01:23:11.798
"that are out there, that when they arise we can
properly counter them."

01:23:11.798 --> 01:23:13.064
LAURA: Can I insight check him?

01:23:13.064 --> 01:23:15.040
MATT: Yes, go for it.

01:23:18.578 --> 01:23:20.228
LAURA: (groans)

01:23:20.228 --> 01:23:21.368
TRAVIS: Turd burgers.

01:23:21.368 --> 01:23:25.628
LAURA: It's not terrible, but it ain't good, 14.

01:23:25.628 --> 01:23:32.765
MATT: 14. He's hard to read in general,
disposition and station, and his eyes are so

01:23:32.765 --> 01:23:41.299
white, like the iris is almost not visible. And
he's stone-faced in his explanation but he's making

01:23:41.429 --> 01:23:45.379
sense, you know. If you have information on--

01:23:45.446 --> 01:23:47.893
LAURA: Necromancy.

01:23:47.893 --> 01:23:49.332
MATT: On necromancy!

01:23:49.332 --> 01:23:50.538
LAURA: Yes.

01:23:50.538 --> 01:23:51.571
TALIESIN: Jif.

01:23:51.571 --> 01:23:55.564
MATT: Or any devices that darker forces utilize,
it better prepares you if

01:23:55.647 --> 01:23:58.469
you know what those entail.

01:23:58.475 --> 01:23:59.438
LAURA: Right.

01:23:59.438 --> 01:24:02.274
MATT: And if there is any place that could
withstand the corruption of such a book, it would

01:24:02.274 --> 01:24:08.616
be the strongest focus of the Platinum Dragon's
divine power that exists on the planet.

01:24:08.616 --> 01:24:09.911
LAURA: Well, that's good.

01:24:09.911 --> 01:24:15.972
MATT: So, you get the sense that Vord is not
deceiving you.

01:24:15.972 --> 01:24:18.034
LAURA: Okay.

01:24:20.041 --> 01:24:22.205
LIAM: What happens after you research it?

01:24:22.205 --> 01:24:25.801
MATT: "We seal it in the vaults below, same place
we stored the horn."

01:24:25.801 --> 01:24:33.091
LIAM: Has that vault ever been disturbed in its
entire history?

01:24:33.440 --> 01:24:39.746
MATT: "It's been a long time and we've reinforced
it. If I recall, last time you were here you

01:24:39.746 --> 01:24:43.832
"encountered some of our defense yourselves."

01:24:43.890 --> 01:24:45.270
LAURA: Yes.

01:24:45.270 --> 01:24:50.508
MATT: "I think you'll know by memory that we are
well fortified. So--"

01:24:53.820 --> 01:24:57.810
LAURA: Be warned, the book tried to claim me.

01:24:58.168 --> 01:25:08.491
MATT: "Hmm. If you resisted it, I have no doubt
our clerics can as well." He nods his head over to

01:25:08.491 --> 01:25:09.850
one of his advisors.

01:25:09.850 --> 01:25:10.721
TRAVIS: Shade.

01:25:10.721 --> 01:25:12.829
LAURA: I know, yeah.

01:25:12.829 --> 01:25:13.750
TRAVIS: Dark shade.

01:25:13.750 --> 01:25:17.028
MATT: This young man with a very, very tight braid
pulled to the back of the head that dangles about

01:25:17.028 --> 01:25:21.073
mid-back behind silver and white robes just
approaches and puts his hands out

01:25:21.073 --> 01:25:25.172
to accept the tome.

01:25:25.172 --> 01:25:32.228
LIAM: Oh, I'm sorry, we weren't clear. We came to
discuss it. We don't have it now.

01:25:33.844 --> 01:25:39.340
MATT: Puts his hands aside and steps back. "Oh.
Well. Return with the tome, should you see fit to

01:25:39.340 --> 01:25:41.280
"leave it here."

01:25:42.333 --> 01:25:46.421
LAURA: Can I ask you, how much do you know of
Orcus?

01:25:48.206 --> 01:25:50.332
MATT: "I know enough."

01:25:51.237 --> 01:25:56.119
LAURA: I don't know much of anything, and it's
important that we learn.

01:25:56.119 --> 01:26:04.304
MATT: "Hmm." So, he nods to one of the other
advisors who steps off for a moment. "Sit a

01:26:04.369 --> 01:26:10.599
"moment. This is a conversation to have." And some
of the guards come and bring a few chairs and set

01:26:10.599 --> 01:26:24.250
them behind you. "Orcus, the demon prince of
undeath, resides in the depths of Thanatos, one of

01:26:24.250 --> 01:26:33.082
"the varying realms of the Abyss. It is here that
he snuffs the life from all creatures and brings

01:26:33.082 --> 01:26:44.967
"them under his sway. He is an entity of
ever-hungering need for power, and to take all

01:26:44.967 --> 01:26:51.593
"life and break it so he can bring it under his
control. Thankfully, as one of the betrayer gods,

01:26:51.593 --> 01:26:58.233
"he was sealed away, and the Divine Gate was placed
up to prevent his, and any other evil entities'

01:26:58.233 --> 01:27:08.925
"entrance into our world. However, that does not
prevent him from sending his minions, sending his

01:27:08.925 --> 01:27:16.476
"powers, sending his influence out through the
permeable, small gaps in this gate. So his

01:27:16.476 --> 01:27:18.231
"influence remains."

01:27:20.138 --> 01:27:23.455
LAURA: He only has two horns, right?

01:27:23.455 --> 01:27:26.406
MATT: "Oh! Four, once."

01:27:27.927 --> 01:27:29.225
LAURA: Four?

01:27:29.225 --> 01:27:34.141
MATT: "Two that he maintains on himself to this
day, and two that were severed, enchanted, and

01:27:34.141 --> 01:27:39.396
"bequeathed into two of his, at the time, one of his
champions."

01:27:39.571 --> 01:27:42.777
LIAM: And all these many months, you've been in
possession of the horn you have?

01:27:42.777 --> 01:27:44.534
MATT: "Yes."

01:27:44.534 --> 01:27:47.048
LAURA: And you don't have another one down in that
vault?

01:27:47.048 --> 01:27:48.288
MATT: "We do not."

01:27:48.288 --> 01:27:51.545
LIAM: What have you learned of the one you do
have?

01:27:51.545 --> 01:27:58.999
MATT: "Well, this belonged to a great and terrible
champion of Orcus. It was utilized in the

01:27:58.999 --> 01:28:08.924
"Calamity, the war that came to the very gates of
Vasselheim. This armored evil was destroyed and

01:28:08.924 --> 01:28:16.287
"torn asunder, the horn scattered. We currently
have some of our finest and brightest out in

01:28:16.287 --> 01:28:23.038
"search of the other one, now that we know they
have and can be recovered. Not to any avail yet,

01:28:23.038 --> 01:28:25.168
"but we're doing our best."

01:28:28.215 --> 01:28:31.883
LAURA: If you hear any word of that horn, will you
send word to us?

01:28:31.883 --> 01:28:33.528
MATT: "Of course. And you do the same, please."

01:28:33.528 --> 01:28:35.114
LAURA: Of course.

01:28:35.114 --> 01:28:37.455
MATT: "One was dangerous enough."

01:28:42.179 --> 01:28:48.091
LIAM: We need to discuss a few things, but we'll
fetch the tome.

01:28:48.327 --> 01:28:49.192
MATT: "Very well."

01:28:49.192 --> 01:28:51.461
LAURA: Thank you so much for your time.

01:28:51.937 --> 01:28:56.799
MATT: "I don't have much of it. If you have
business to discuss with me personally, I would

01:28:56.799 --> 01:29:01.347
"recommend doing it now. Otherwise, you'll be
dealing with one of my advisors when you return."

01:29:01.786 --> 01:29:05.385
LAURA: Do you know much about the Nine Hells?

01:29:05.385 --> 01:29:09.496
MATT: "That's a complicated subject. What do you
need to know?"

01:29:09.496 --> 01:29:12.606
LAURA: I fear we have to travel there.

01:29:12.606 --> 01:29:17.888
MATT: "Why, pray tell, do you intend to travel
there?"

01:29:17.888 --> 01:29:30.027
LAURA: There is a rakshasa after my brother and
our cleric friend, Pike. And, unfortunately, I

01:29:30.027 --> 01:29:34.217
fear he will return if we don't snuff him out at
the source.

01:29:34.217 --> 01:29:36.365
LIAM: It's already made one attempt.

01:29:36.365 --> 01:29:37.579
MATT: "Hmm."

01:29:37.579 --> 01:29:39.421
LIAM: It's only a matter of time.

01:29:41.701 --> 01:29:50.209
MATT: "I've dealt with fiends. I've dealt with
devils. I am not a specialist on the Hells, but

01:29:50.209 --> 01:29:58.335
"there are a few places where you could possibly
research this information. Majority of such

01:29:58.335 --> 01:30:08.475
"research is found in the presence, or at least in
the grasp of the Cobalt Soul. They do have one

01:30:08.475 --> 01:30:16.711
"small temple here in the city, and they have one
over in Tal'Dorei. Either one will have some

01:30:16.711 --> 01:30:24.224
"semblance of research at their disposal. What I
can tell you is, in asking about Orcus and the

01:30:24.224 --> 01:30:31.570
"Abyss, those are demons, entities, savage,
chaotic, in selfish, hard to read societies that

01:30:31.570 --> 01:30:38.455
"twist, crumble and rebuild, a rate that only
insanity can seem to drive. Madness and hunger

01:30:38.455 --> 01:30:47.748
"drives the Abyss. But the Hells, the Hells are
built on tyranny. They are built on societies,

01:30:47.748 --> 01:30:59.616
"power structures, subservience and dominance.
Whereas few mortals dare tread in the Abyss, there

01:30:59.616 --> 01:31:06.474
"have been some from many different realms, who go
to the Hells to do business."

01:31:09.943 --> 01:31:16.063
LAURA: Do you know what sort of people might
survive there?

01:31:16.063 --> 01:31:18.190
LIAM: Or fit in?

01:31:18.692 --> 01:31:34.979
MATT: "Powerful ones. Ones that stay out of sight.
Ones that don't make a scene. Just know; they're

01:31:34.979 --> 01:31:43.574
"very clever, and above all else, they seek your
soul."

01:31:45.997 --> 01:31:47.888
LAURA: All right.

01:31:48.593 --> 01:31:52.045
LIAM: No big.

01:31:52.104 --> 01:31:53.825
LAURA: All right.

01:31:54.723 --> 01:31:55.838
LIAM: Thank you for your time.

01:31:55.838 --> 01:31:57.666
LAURA: So, we'll go to the Cobalt Reserve.

01:31:57.666 --> 01:32:01.240
MATT: "All right. One of my advisors will receive
the tome upon its delivery."

01:32:01.240 --> 01:32:03.055
LAURA: Fabulous. Thank you.

01:32:03.055 --> 01:32:04.526
MATT: "Good luck."

01:32:04.526 --> 01:32:05.917
LAURA: (whistles)

01:32:05.917 --> 01:32:08.896
MATT: He stands up and as soon as you begin to
stand up, the seats are already immediately pulled

01:32:08.896 --> 01:32:15.148
out from behind you. The guards separate them, he
leaves with his advisors and you guys are led out

01:32:15.148 --> 01:32:20.530
of the temple back onto the winding staircase and
into the heart of Vasselheim.

01:32:21.328 --> 01:32:32.289
LIAM: I pull Vex into an alleyway. (sighs) I don't
know what the right thing to do is. I thought one

01:32:32.289 --> 01:32:33.663
thing going in there.

01:32:33.663 --> 01:32:34.900
LAURA: Mm-hm.

01:32:34.900 --> 01:32:43.073
LIAM: And now I think maybe you were right. I have
not wanted to go to that temple, though. She has

01:32:43.073 --> 01:32:45.923
finally been speaking to me again.

01:32:45.923 --> 01:32:49.615
LAURA: All right. What about?

01:32:49.615 --> 01:33:01.177
LIAM: When I died, I saw her. I have dreamed of
her already. And she speaks of some sort of

01:33:01.177 --> 01:33:12.540
purpose on the horizon. And I don't know if she's
talking about your promise you made, or what. But

01:33:12.540 --> 01:33:19.918
she is with us. And I barely know what the fuck
I'm doing, but I know that she doesn't want that

01:33:19.918 --> 01:33:29.697
book to exist. And, honestly, I am frightened of
going to that temple because I want time. I want

01:33:29.752 --> 01:33:34.590
time with you, I want time with Keyleth, I want
time.

01:33:34.590 --> 01:33:35.781
LAURA: All right.

01:33:35.781 --> 01:33:40.213
LIAM: And I don't want to lose that time now, I
want to be selfish for a little while. We've been

01:33:40.213 --> 01:33:43.858
working so fucking hard, by all rights we should
be dead.

01:33:45.625 --> 01:33:49.919
LAURA: Do you think if you go to the Raven Queen's
temple, she'll claim you for her own right now?

01:33:49.919 --> 01:33:54.938
LIAM: Well, I don't know. I don't know. And look
at this. And I start to unbuckle the front of my

01:33:54.938 --> 01:33:57.575
chest-- Relax, look at this.

01:33:58.059 --> 01:33:59.724
LAURA: What am I seeing? (laughs)

01:33:59.724 --> 01:34:05.796
MATT: You see right around his heart there's a
dark spot in the skin where some dark veins travel

01:34:05.796 --> 01:34:08.198
for about an inch or two across.

01:34:08.198 --> 01:34:09.275
LAURA: What the fuck is this?

01:34:09.275 --> 01:34:10.595
LIAM: I don't know.

01:34:10.595 --> 01:34:11.968
LAURA: When did it happen?

01:34:11.968 --> 01:34:13.019
LIAM: I don't know.

01:34:13.019 --> 01:34:15.677
LAURA: What do you mean, you don't know? Did it
happen after you died?

01:34:15.677 --> 01:34:20.643
LIAM: I think so. Hurts a little bit.

01:34:20.643 --> 01:34:25.656
LAURA: What the fuck? We have to get you to a
cleric, that's not normal!

01:34:25.656 --> 01:34:31.110
LIAM: Not really, no. I cover it back up.

01:34:31.110 --> 01:34:35.929
LAURA: Are you sure it's related to her?

01:34:40.376 --> 01:34:45.433
LIAM: But I think you are right, and I think that
they're going to hold that, and someone will take

01:34:45.433 --> 01:34:50.202
it, whether it's in a hundred years or a thousand
years, and she doesn't want it and--

01:34:50.521 --> 01:34:53.522
LAURA: Well, they're holding the Horn of Orcus.
Playing devil's advocate.

01:34:53.522 --> 01:34:57.268
LIAM: Yeah, they already have that. They don't
have this.

01:34:57.852 --> 01:34:59.756
LAURA: Then let's go to the Raven Queen's temple.

01:34:59.756 --> 01:35:00.939
LIAM: All right.

01:35:00.939 --> 01:35:01.837
LAURA: Do you want to go now?

01:35:01.837 --> 01:35:02.531
LIAM: Yes.

01:35:02.531 --> 01:35:04.008
LAURA: Let's go.

01:35:04.856 --> 01:35:11.571
MATT: Okay, while you guys make your way to the
Raven's Eyrie, we go to you two. You guys are

01:35:11.571 --> 01:35:16.280
currently looking for a library. Who wants to make
the investigation check to ask for information?

01:35:16.508 --> 01:35:19.051
TALIESIN: I'll do it, that's funny.

01:35:20.558 --> 01:35:23.484
LAURA: Would I have known anything about what that
thing was?

01:35:24.774 --> 01:35:32.097
MATT: Not really. It doesn't look diseased. It
looks bruised almost. It's just a strange-looking

01:35:32.097 --> 01:35:35.548
bruise where you can see some of the veins are
dark and visible,

01:35:35.548 --> 01:35:38.032
almost like varicose near the surface.

01:35:39.619 --> 01:35:40.826
LAURA: Like trauma?

01:35:40.826 --> 01:35:44.681
MATT: Kind of, yeah, but it doesn't look--

01:35:44.915 --> 01:35:46.712
LAURA: It doesn't look like Raishan's?

01:35:46.712 --> 01:35:49.156
MATT: No, it's not like that.

01:35:50.136 --> 01:35:57.361
MARISHA: So, we have the book. They went to the
sanctuary. We are going to the library.

01:35:57.361 --> 01:35:58.230
MATT: Yes.

01:35:58.230 --> 01:35:58.956
TALIESIN: Okay.

01:35:58.956 --> 01:35:59.599
MARISHA: Okay!

01:35:59.599 --> 01:36:00.704
MATT: As far as I know, that's what you guys are
searching for.

01:36:00.704 --> 01:36:02.612
LAURA: Wait, I thought we had the book.

01:36:02.612 --> 01:36:06.360
TALIESIN: It's in the-- wait, no, the book's in
the bag.

01:36:06.360 --> 01:36:07.868
TRAVIS: And I'm the one with the low
intelligence.

01:36:07.868 --> 01:36:09.843
MATT: (singsong) Grog has the book.

01:36:09.843 --> 01:36:15.245
MARISHA: You guys, I thought our whole thing was
that we were taking the book to the sanctuary and

01:36:15.245 --> 01:36:18.953
then you guys were like, we're going to the
sanctuary, because you guys totally gave me shit

01:36:18.953 --> 01:36:23.692
when I was like, the library, and you were like,
not the library, but apparently we are.

01:36:24.533 --> 01:36:25.571
TALIESIN: Yes.

01:36:25.571 --> 01:36:27.133
MARISHA: All right. Let's go to the library.

01:36:27.133 --> 01:36:28.740
TALIESIN: I rolled a 16.

01:36:28.740 --> 01:36:30.756
MATT: It's like Vox Machina has a hard time
planning.

01:36:30.756 --> 01:36:32.814
(all laugh)

01:36:32.814 --> 01:36:34.084
TALIESIN: Don't agree with him.

01:36:34.084 --> 01:36:34.957
MATT: It's crazy.

01:36:34.957 --> 01:36:36.388
TALIESIN: That's not fair.

01:36:36.388 --> 01:36:37.522
SAM: I'm the new guy.

01:36:37.522 --> 01:36:39.467
(all laugh)

01:36:39.467 --> 01:36:40.739
TRAVIS: "I'm the new guy."

01:36:40.739 --> 01:36:42.179
TALIESIN: 16, investigation.

01:36:42.179 --> 01:36:44.378
MARISHA: We said we had the book.

01:36:44.378 --> 01:36:46.658
TALIESIN: We thought we did, we were not paying
attention.

01:36:46.658 --> 01:36:47.664
MATT: Did you say you took the book?

01:36:47.664 --> 01:36:49.182
MARISHA: I thought we took the book, that was our
whole fucking plan--

01:36:49.182 --> 01:36:50.537
TALIESIN: I thought we took the book too.

01:36:50.537 --> 01:36:52.102
MARISHA: -- that we took the damn book.

01:36:52.102 --> 01:36:53.926
TALIESIN: It occurs to me it was actually in the
bag that Grog was holding.

01:36:53.926 --> 01:36:56.731
MARISHA: But I would assume if we said, "we're
taking the book", that would mean--

01:36:56.731 --> 01:36:59.382
MATT: If you guys said you're taking the book;
Grog, you heard them take the book?

01:36:59.382 --> 01:37:01.690
TRAVIS: I thought you said you were taking the
book to go look at the wherever.

01:37:01.690 --> 01:37:03.196
MARISHA: We have the book.

01:37:03.196 --> 01:37:06.806
MATT: All right. I'll take that as consensus to
say that you guys have the book.

01:37:06.806 --> 01:37:09.074
SAM: Oh, I used the book to make the wig. Is that
okay?

01:37:09.074 --> 01:37:11.035
(all laugh)

01:37:11.035 --> 01:37:13.523
SAM: It's just, it's all paper.

01:37:13.523 --> 01:37:15.730
LAURA: It's glued under the cloak.

01:37:15.730 --> 01:37:16.735
MATT: Make a wisdom saving throw.

01:37:16.735 --> 01:37:19.088
TALIESIN: Papier-mâché of evil.

01:37:19.088 --> 01:37:24.298
MATT: Okay. You guys, not having a bag of holding,
are clutching the tome--

01:37:24.298 --> 01:37:26.742
it's a big tome, it's like--

01:37:26.742 --> 01:37:28.661
MARISHA: I thought we put it in a box, right?

01:37:28.661 --> 01:37:29.939
MATT: No.

01:37:29.939 --> 01:37:32.410
TALIESIN: No, we didn't have a box.

01:37:32.410 --> 01:37:36.865
LAURA: There was no box. It was a book wrapped in
cloth in the bag of holding.

01:37:36.865 --> 01:37:37.607
SAM: In a box.

01:37:37.607 --> 01:37:39.137
MARISHA: We wrapped it in cloth.

01:37:39.137 --> 01:37:43.375
MATT: So there you go. You have a tome wrapped in
cloth under your arm. You guys spend about an hour

01:37:43.375 --> 01:37:52.163
or so asking around. The locals, they're-- not
saying they're not friendly, but not all of them

01:37:52.163 --> 01:37:57.602
are well-versed in what you're asking. You say
library, some of them are more simpler folk are

01:37:57.602 --> 01:38:03.420
like, "I don't--" and eventually somebody says,
"Oh yeah, you can head over to the-- what's it

01:38:03.420 --> 01:38:09.493
"called? The Cobalt Vault. It's in the southern
region of the Quad Roads."

01:38:09.493 --> 01:38:11.107
TALIESIN: That's exactly what I was looking for,
thank you so much.

01:38:11.107 --> 01:38:13.134
MATT: "All right, yeah, I'll show you." And the
guy gives you a couple directions down the road,

01:38:13.134 --> 01:38:18.296
and you make your way there, and it's similar to
the Cobalt Reserve in Westruun, but it's about a

01:38:18.369 --> 01:38:19.860
quarter of the size.

01:38:19.860 --> 01:38:21.075
MARISHA: Okay.

01:38:21.075 --> 01:38:26.902
MATT: The Cobalt Reserve is the center of the
Cobalt Soul monk order, the Ioun worshipers that

01:38:26.902 --> 01:38:39.217
gather information and maintain it. As Ioun's
presence was shattered slightly during the

01:38:39.217 --> 01:38:50.892
Calamity, in the battle against the chained god,
her presence in Vasselheim was diminished and then

01:38:50.892 --> 01:38:58.789
regrew through the Cobalt Soul in Westruun, so
it's expanding back into Vasselheim. You make your

01:38:58.789 --> 01:39:06.986
way to the structure. The exterior of it is this
light-grey stone, it's a cylindrical building with

01:39:06.986 --> 01:39:16.346
three different doorways around the outside and a
giant, bright blue and black marbled dome on top.

01:39:16.346 --> 01:39:23.737
It looks somewhat transparent, like it's made of a
glass-type material. As you step into the front,

01:39:23.737 --> 01:39:30.002
you can see a central chamber within the inside
that's also cylindrical, so you have a small

01:39:30.186 --> 01:39:37.081
walk-around hallway on the immediate inside of
this giant structure, and then the actual library

01:39:37.141 --> 01:39:40.961
is in the interior, and so on the outside, you see
a few books and there are some paintings and

01:39:40.961 --> 01:39:48.956
tapestries on the walls and you see a few varying
monks walking around, a handful that are curious

01:39:48.956 --> 01:39:54.178
and turn as you walk in. They're all wearing the
uniform, dark grey and blue robes of the Cobalt

01:39:54.178 --> 01:40:02.365
Soul, and there is a desk at the front, where you
have a young woman of olive skin sitting, her hair

01:40:02.365 --> 01:40:08.075
short and wavy with very thick spectacles adorning
the front of her nose. Young-ish, maybe

01:40:08.075 --> 01:40:21.101
mid-twenties. She looks up as soon as you guys
approach. "Good day. I fear we're still in the

01:40:21.101 --> 01:40:26.999
"process of preparing the interior, but what do you
require?"

01:40:27.267 --> 01:40:31.405
TALIESIN: We were hoping for access to some of the
deep research archives. We've been looking around,

01:40:31.405 --> 01:40:39.099
we have several complicated matters that we need
to research, and we heard that you had a wonderful

01:40:39.156 --> 01:40:44.706
collection and we were hoping to gain access to
some materials, preferably of the histories of

01:40:44.706 --> 01:40:47.878
Orcus, the Nine Hells, a few various things.

01:40:48.806 --> 01:40:56.005
MATT: "I'm terribly sorry, that type of research
is only for Cobalt Soul members."

01:40:57.484 --> 01:41:00.752
TALIESIN: Who could we talk to about special
access?

01:41:00.752 --> 01:41:03.369
I'm sure that there must be somebody in charge.

01:41:04.897 --> 01:41:07.227
MATT: "I apologize, I am--"

01:41:08.528 --> 01:41:10.033
MARISHA: I'm sorry--

01:41:10.398 --> 01:41:11.665
MATT: "I'm going to have--"

01:41:11.665 --> 01:41:16.885
MARISHA: I am Keyleth of the Air Ashari and this
is Percival Fredrickstein Von Musel

01:41:16.885 --> 01:41:18.884
Klossowski de Rolo III.

01:41:18.884 --> 01:41:20.634
TALIESIN: Close enough.

01:41:20.634 --> 01:41:27.109
MARISHA: We're a part of the group Vox Machina,
we've been through here before, we're part of the

01:41:27.109 --> 01:41:37.668
Slayer's Take. This is a matter of great
importance, so if there is any type of upper

01:41:37.668 --> 01:41:39.371
management we could talk to--

01:41:39.371 --> 01:41:40.343
(all laugh)

01:41:40.343 --> 01:41:43.086
MATT: Roll a persuasion check.

01:41:43.086 --> 01:41:44.478
TRAVIS: Fuck this. It's just that dismount at the
end.

01:41:44.478 --> 01:41:45.972
TALIESIN: (creepy voice) Who wants to talk to the
librarian?

01:41:45.972 --> 01:41:46.970
MATT: It's Keyleth's specialty.

01:41:46.970 --> 01:41:48.462
LIAM: It was going great.

01:41:48.462 --> 01:41:53.889
MARISHA: (coughs) Mm, 11.

01:41:53.889 --> 01:42:03.241
MATT: "I mean no offense, but I don't think we
have the kind of research that you're looking for

01:42:03.241 --> 01:42:05.240
"that we could--"

01:42:05.240 --> 01:42:10.050
TALIESIN: We would also possibly like to make a
donation. And I pull out the Manual of Quickness

01:42:10.050 --> 01:42:13.179
of Action, place it upon the table.

01:42:15.770 --> 01:42:22.697
MATT: She adjusts her glasses for a second and
reaches into the desk and pulls out a small, white

01:42:22.697 --> 01:42:27.901
gem and passes it over, and as she does, you can
see the front of the tome seems to glow almost

01:42:27.901 --> 01:42:32.256
like a blacklight over something that was reactive
to it.

01:42:33.873 --> 01:42:35.905
SAM: Covered in semen.

01:42:36.849 --> 01:42:40.327
MATT: As soon as I said it, I was waiting for Sam
on that one.

01:42:40.327 --> 01:42:41.601
SAM: Sure, sure.

01:42:41.601 --> 01:42:44.601
TALIESIN: Thank you for ruining that one for me
for all time.

01:42:45.153 --> 01:42:54.011
MATT: Scans over. "Perhaps. Give me just a moment,
please." And she slides the book in your

01:42:54.011 --> 01:42:57.802
direction, gets up and exits through one of the
small doors in the side, that you didn't notice

01:42:57.802 --> 01:43:02.375
until now. It's part of a similar stone, just
gives way and then closes behind her.

01:43:02.448 --> 01:43:04.181
TALIESIN: Well, we'll see what happens now.

01:43:04.181 --> 01:43:08.699
MARISHA: And yet, worst case scenario, I also have
this book that Scanlan read that's on how to be a

01:43:08.699 --> 01:43:10.309
good leader--

01:43:11.090 --> 01:43:12.695
TALIESIN: Hold on to that one.

01:43:12.695 --> 01:43:14.558
MARISHA: All right, I'll hold on to it.

01:43:15.695 --> 01:43:25.726
MATT: The door opens again and she comes back out,
followed by a man of very, very dark skin, bright,

01:43:25.726 --> 01:43:32.282
soft eyes that crack on the sides from, you can
gather, a lot of smiling. He wears the same

01:43:32.282 --> 01:43:41.158
uniform, blue and gray robes, but as he walks, you
can hear what sounds almost like a faint-- almost

01:43:41.158 --> 01:43:47.049
like jewelry clanging, but you don't see any
jewelry on him, and as he approaches, his arms are

01:43:47.049 --> 01:43:54.036
folded into themselves, and he steps forward
quietly, looks at the book for a second, looks up

01:43:54.036 --> 01:44:05.000
at the two of you, and smiles, "Hello. My name is
Kusuo and I am in charge of looking over this

01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:11.420
"extension of the Cobalt Reserve's reach and
collection.

01:44:11.420 --> 01:44:15.290
"You have come to offer this book as trade?"

01:44:15.290 --> 01:44:16.067
TALIESIN: Yes.

01:44:16.067 --> 01:44:17.590
MATT: "And you are seeking what?"

01:44:17.590 --> 01:44:24.212
TALIESIN: Well, we are in a bit of a bind. We are
members of a traveling group of adventurers known

01:44:24.386 --> 01:44:29.045
as Vox Machina. We recently helped defeat the
Chroma Conclave.

01:44:29.653 --> 01:44:35.952
MATT: "I'm familiar with your exploits as of late,
yes. It is our job to collect information and

01:44:35.952 --> 01:44:39.892
"history and record of it, so I am very aware."

01:44:39.892 --> 01:44:45.256
TALIESIN: Well, the deeds and those things that
must be done have not yet been fulfilled. We have

01:44:45.256 --> 01:44:54.317
just a few last, treacherous events that we must
complete before the Chroma Conclave is completely

01:44:54.317 --> 01:45:02.314
put to rest. One of which has to do with Orcus,
and the other with the Nine Hells.

01:45:02.314 --> 01:45:04.525
MARISHA: It's a rakshasa.

01:45:04.525 --> 01:45:13.641
TALIESIN: And we are desperate for knowledge that
may keep us safe in our travels. Prepare us for

01:45:13.641 --> 01:45:15.529
our enemies.

01:45:17.512 --> 01:45:23.331
MATT: "Come with me." And he takes the book and
sweeps it up, and it vanishes into his robe.

01:45:23.822 --> 01:45:25.344
TALIESIN: Worth it!

01:45:25.855 --> 01:45:30.507
MATT: He leads you into the small doorway that you
watched open and shut before, and on the inside,

01:45:30.507 --> 01:45:41.030
you go from this barren outer walkway, into this
large cylindrical library that is from floor to

01:45:41.030 --> 01:45:51.655
ceiling about 60 feet tall, with dozens of ladders
that move around, and you can see books are in the

01:45:51.655 --> 01:45:55.785
process of being put up, some books are being
categorized, it looks like there were stacks that

01:45:55.785 --> 01:45:59.181
have just arrived that are in the process of being
researched and copied, there are a number of these

01:45:59.181 --> 01:46:05.175
monks that are at different tables in the process
of making copies of books, this is specifically a

01:46:05.175 --> 01:46:12.315
repository for the gathering and guarding of
information. In the center of the chamber, there

01:46:12.315 --> 01:46:18.392
is a spiral staircase that leads to an upper
platform that has another series of chairs, either

01:46:18.392 --> 01:46:22.894
a research or reading section, and there are only
a handful of people on the interior that are not

01:46:22.894 --> 01:46:30.340
dressed in the same way that these monks are, but
each one of them is attended by a monk. And you--

01:46:30.340 --> 01:46:35.335
MARISHA: Anyone look familiar? Any uniforms that
look recognizable?

01:46:35.335 --> 01:46:37.501
MATT: Make a perception check.

01:46:39.867 --> 01:46:42.508
TALIESIN: Yeah, use that one. That's weird.

01:46:42.508 --> 01:46:45.274
MARISHA: It's on another dice? All right.

01:46:45.274 --> 01:46:46.196
TALIESIN: There, that's better.

01:46:46.196 --> 01:46:47.261
MARISHA: Oh, that's good!

01:46:47.261 --> 01:46:47.951
TALIESIN: What is that? Oh--

01:46:47.951 --> 01:46:49.470
MARISHA: That's a 19! Perception?

01:46:49.470 --> 01:46:50.393
MATT: Perception.

01:46:50.393 --> 01:46:53.884
MARISHA: 21. Sorry, 20. Yeah, 21.

01:46:53.884 --> 01:46:55.038
MATT: Okay, so you glance around--

01:46:55.038 --> 01:46:57.216
MARISHA: No! 31!

01:46:57.216 --> 01:46:59.567
MATT: There we go! I was like, your wisdom's
pretty high--

01:46:59.567 --> 01:47:01.021
MARISHA: 31.

01:47:01.021 --> 01:47:06.964
MATT: Okay. You look around really fast, glance at
each person that is not of the Cobalt Reserve's

01:47:06.964 --> 01:47:13.955
attire, no one you recognize. But they all appear
to be fairly affluent. And they're all in the

01:47:13.955 --> 01:47:21.832
process of reading through some sort of thick book
with a stack next to them, of varying sizes, and

01:47:21.832 --> 01:47:25.540
the monk is just standing there patiently,
watching them as they do so.

01:47:25.540 --> 01:47:26.902
TALIESIN: That's disconcerting.

01:47:26.902 --> 01:47:32.606
MATT: And you recall, from your first time at the
Cobalt Reserve, that no books can be taken from

01:47:32.606 --> 01:47:37.997
the Reserve. They can be read within the interior,
they can be copied, notes can be taken. But you

01:47:37.997 --> 01:47:43.403
cannot remove them, and the monk that is assigned
to you is both a guide, and to make sure you don't

01:47:43.403 --> 01:47:44.900
take anything you're not supposed to.

01:47:44.900 --> 01:47:46.168
MARISHA: Right. Theft protection.

01:47:46.168 --> 01:47:52.847
MATT: Yes. And it seems that Kusuo has taken upon
himself to be your assigned monk.

01:47:52.847 --> 01:47:55.650
TALIESIN: There's quite a bustle today, this is
impressive.

01:47:55.705 --> 01:48:02.324
MATT: "It is more than we are used to, usually.
But we are happy to know that people are

01:48:02.324 --> 01:48:05.493
"interested in knowledge. Any given day."

01:48:05.493 --> 01:48:09.487
MARISHA: Any reason for the sudden spark in
interest?

01:48:09.487 --> 01:48:16.551
MATT: "Well, recent events of dragons terrorizing
countrysides, leads people to want to defend

01:48:16.551 --> 01:48:22.568
"themselves and learn of these occasional
terrors."

01:48:22.833 --> 01:48:24.431
MARISHA: Good on them.

01:48:24.431 --> 01:48:29.819
MATT: "Anyway, follow me." And he leads you to the
back of the spiral staircase, as it comes and

01:48:29.819 --> 01:48:37.031
meets with the floor, there is a large rug that
sits as part of the decor there, and he glances

01:48:37.031 --> 01:48:44.802
around, and using his foot, his toe clips the edge
of it and flicks up and catches the rug, folds it

01:48:44.802 --> 01:48:50.862
and sets it down, in one swift motion you weren't
expecting, and with the dust that sets off, you

01:48:50.862 --> 01:48:56.971
now see what looks to be a trap door of the same
material as the hardwood floor of the library. The

01:48:56.971 --> 01:49:01.291
small chain that he then bends down carefully,
tugs and lifts, and you see the staircase that

01:49:01.291 --> 01:49:02.640
descends below.

01:49:02.640 --> 01:49:04.747
MARISHA: Can you do that with your toes?

01:49:04.747 --> 01:49:05.892
TALIESIN: Not with my toes, no.

01:49:05.892 --> 01:49:10.350
LIAM: That's some Name of the Rose shit right there.

01:49:10.409 --> 01:49:18.771
MATT: "The books you require, we keep in the
cellar. So, please, after you." It's a staircase.

01:49:18.840 --> 01:49:21.231
(all laughs)

01:49:21.290 --> 01:49:22.903
TALIESIN: No! I'm committed!

01:49:22.903 --> 01:49:24.090
MATT: (laughs) You're just going down--

01:49:24.090 --> 01:49:25.600
LIAM: Then an escalator!

01:49:25.600 --> 01:49:31.760
MATT: You're dog paddling your way through the
darkness. You guys descend and the trap door

01:49:31.817 --> 01:49:37.598
closes behind you and it is pitch black. You have
no vision, you can see in the vicinity, the stairs

01:49:37.598 --> 01:49:42.977
go down maybe 20 feet, however as soon as the trap
door closes, a soft glow emanates from behind you

01:49:42.977 --> 01:49:50.073
and you can see there is some sort of a dangling
wristband with a small glass marble that hangs at

01:49:50.073 --> 01:49:55.012
the end that is now glowing with a soft
candlelight, and Kusuo is holding his arm in front

01:49:55.012 --> 01:50:00.627
of him as it dangles like a candle, and he slowly
brushes past you and leads the way down before the

01:50:00.627 --> 01:50:08.208
stairs stop and level off into an open chamber, a
square room, the cellar as he called it. There,

01:50:08.208 --> 01:50:15.084
inside, you see candelabras flickering in the
corners, there's four of them, two near you and

01:50:15.084 --> 01:50:20.611
two on the far side. Within the shadowed,
subterranean chamber, you see shelves and locked

01:50:20.611 --> 01:50:27.611
cases throughout. Some cases are glass, some are
almost crate-like, but they have locks on the

01:50:27.611 --> 01:50:33.286
sides, and on these shelves it isn't books stacked
to each end, each book is facing forward, and

01:50:33.286 --> 01:50:37.851
seems to be placed deliberately, and some of them
are chained in, some of them have chains that

01:50:37.851 --> 01:50:42.509
dangle from the piece-- this is where all the
secret books are kept.

01:50:42.509 --> 01:50:44.971
This is the private collection.

01:50:44.971 --> 01:50:48.140
TALIESIN: Books that want to get out.

01:50:48.140 --> 01:50:52.435
MATT: As soon you guys enter the space, two monks
of the Cobalt Soul spin out of the corners and

01:50:52.435 --> 01:50:55.527
immediately stand in the defensive position with
their arms out in front of them, and then as soon

01:50:55.527 --> 01:51:03.366
as they see Kusuo smiles and nods, they put their
guard down, arms together, and they bow for Kusuo.

01:51:03.422 --> 01:51:08.708
Kusuo turns back over the shoulder, "Do not worry,
this is Wailen and Sura, they are assigned to

01:51:08.708 --> 01:51:18.315
"watch over. So, stand aside, help our guests." He
walks forward and leads you through some of these

01:51:18.315 --> 01:51:22.482
cases, and you look and they're made of different
woods, some of them seem to have been brought from

01:51:22.482 --> 01:51:31.394
different locations, and there are scroll cases,
there are giant wads of ancient parchment that are

01:51:31.394 --> 01:51:38.263
clustered together and bound with some sort of a
leather strip, you can see tomes all across the

01:51:38.263 --> 01:51:45.845
way of different fronts and sizes, and some of
them are very old and ruined. And in the back

01:51:45.845 --> 01:51:53.200
right corner of this chamber, you see Kusuo pulls
what you didn't notice before, and that jangling

01:51:53.200 --> 01:51:58.935
sound you were hearing before is a giant ring of
over a hundred keys that he pulls off of his neck.

01:51:58.935 --> 01:52:01.939
He turns it and begins just thumbing through the
keys, very quickly, like he knows exactly what

01:52:01.939 --> 01:52:09.125
he's doing. Catches one key, looks at it, and
walks over to one of the cases in that corner of

01:52:09.125 --> 01:52:14.455
the room and just undoes the locks, but they're a
different key for each lock, and he goes and finds

01:52:14.455 --> 01:52:20.178
each one. First try, knows exactly where they go.
As each lock is taken, he opens the case and on

01:52:20.178 --> 01:52:29.584
the inside you smell this scent of dust and ash,
and there are four books in there, two of which

01:52:29.584 --> 01:52:38.182
look damaged, but they all look very old, and he
reaches in and grabs two of them. One of them is

01:52:38.182 --> 01:52:44.652
one of the damaged ones, one of them is not. "You
seek information on Orcus?" Sets one tome down on

01:52:44.652 --> 01:52:53.091
one of the nearby closed cases. "And the Nine
Hells." Places the other next to it.

01:52:53.091 --> 01:52:58.014
TALIESIN: I just try and see if I can discern what
the other two books are just from looking in and

01:52:58.014 --> 01:53:00.492
being a nerd.

01:53:00.492 --> 01:53:03.650
MATT: They don't have any labelling on the cover.

01:53:03.650 --> 01:53:13.057
TALIESIN: Oh, nothing. All right. Fascinating.
Thank you. I suppose we'll sit, and get to it.

01:53:13.057 --> 01:53:14.007
MATT: "Very well."

01:53:14.007 --> 01:53:15.309
TALIESIN: And I sit down and I open the book.

01:53:15.309 --> 01:53:16.969
MARISHA: Yes. Which one are you opening?

01:53:16.969 --> 01:53:21.071
TALIESIN: Before I touch it, this doesn't react
poorly to people handling it, does it?

01:53:21.071 --> 01:53:22.604
There's no--

01:53:22.604 --> 01:53:31.537
MATT: He arcs an eyebrow towards you. "No, part
of our distinct training is to disable any sort of

01:53:31.607 --> 01:53:35.122
"wards should you wish to research."

01:53:35.122 --> 01:53:36.708
TALIESIN: Excellent.

01:53:36.708 --> 01:53:39.556
MARISHA: Which one are you opening, Percy?

01:53:39.556 --> 01:53:42.281
TALIESIN: I open the first one just to look
into--

01:53:42.281 --> 01:53:44.083
MARISHA: The Orcus one?

01:53:45.037 --> 01:53:46.619
MATT: Do you speak Abyssal?

01:53:46.619 --> 01:53:50.478
TALIESIN: I do not speak Abyssal.

01:53:50.478 --> 01:53:55.095
MATT: The Orcus tome you aren't able to read. It
is all in Abyssal.

01:53:55.095 --> 01:54:00.230
TALIESIN: Do you speak Abyssal? And the other
book--

01:54:00.230 --> 01:54:01.922
MATT: The other book?

01:54:01.922 --> 01:54:04.613
TALIESIN: -- I open up the Nine Hells, take a
look.

01:54:04.613 --> 01:54:05.998
MATT: That one is actually written in Common.

01:54:05.998 --> 01:54:07.106
TALIESIN: Okay.

01:54:07.106 --> 01:54:08.181
MARISHA: Weird question.

01:54:08.181 --> 01:54:10.264
MATT: Yes.

01:54:10.264 --> 01:54:11.618
MARISHA: Abyssal.

01:54:11.618 --> 01:54:14.228
MATT: Yes.

01:54:14.228 --> 01:54:20.045
MARISHA: I know creatures who are from the Abyss,
right? I've encountered them?

01:54:20.045 --> 01:54:22.222
MATT: You have encountered demons in your past,
yes.

01:54:22.222 --> 01:54:30.746
MARISHA: If I do a Shapechange into a demon, can I
then read Abyssal?

01:54:30.746 --> 01:54:32.684
MATT: Lemme look at the spell real fast.

01:54:32.684 --> 01:54:35.534
SAM: You're going to change into a pit fiend in
the library?

01:54:35.534 --> 01:54:38.746
MARISHA: I would let him know! I would give him
like a disclaimer.

01:54:38.746 --> 01:54:42.984
TALIESIN: I'm going to show you a really weird
birthmark, don't panic.

01:54:47.054 --> 01:54:52.750
LAURA: I mean, if he really was a demon, why would
he need to do research?

01:54:52.750 --> 01:54:55.620
TALIESIN: Who is my father?! I don't know.

01:54:55.620 --> 01:54:59.508
LAURA: Genealogy of the Nine Hells!

01:55:00.792 --> 01:55:10.392
MATT: It does not specify, but it says you gain
the abilities.

01:55:10.392 --> 01:55:12.963
LIAM: I think I've read it says you keep the same
intellect, though, right?

01:55:12.963 --> 01:55:13.950
MATT: Yeah, you keep the same intellect.

01:55:13.950 --> 01:55:15.290
MARISHA: You keep the same mental stats.

01:55:15.290 --> 01:55:16.202
MATT: Correct.

01:55:16.202 --> 01:55:18.098
MARISHA: But you get the abilities--

01:55:18.098 --> 01:55:21.093
MATT: Yeah, you retain all your skills and saving
throw and proficiencies, in addition to gaining

01:55:21.093 --> 01:55:22.904
those of the creature.

01:55:22.904 --> 01:55:24.152
MARISHA: In addition.

01:55:24.152 --> 01:55:29.743
MATT: You don't know.

01:55:29.743 --> 01:55:31.110
MARISHA: I don't know.

01:55:31.110 --> 01:55:32.641
SAM: Might as well try!

01:55:32.641 --> 01:55:37.024
TALIESIN: I'm going to take a moment also before
this happens, open the Common book, take a moment,

01:55:37.024 --> 01:55:43.961
and gently ask the good sir if they have a reading
glass around, because I still don't have any

01:55:43.961 --> 01:55:45.657
reading glasses.

01:55:45.657 --> 01:55:51.846
MATT: (laughs) He gives a curious look. "But of
course." And he snaps his fingers, and the other

01:55:51.846 --> 01:55:57.460
monks, he just darts off for a second and then
returns a moment later with a small wooden case

01:55:57.460 --> 01:56:03.957
that opens up, and on the inside there are four
different types and thickness of reading glass you

01:56:03.957 --> 01:56:05.989
can go through. You find one that'll work okay.

01:56:05.989 --> 01:56:13.748
TALIESIN: Perfect. I'm going to let you deal with
this other end of things, because I'm going to sit

01:56:13.748 --> 01:56:16.519
and read.

01:56:16.682 --> 01:56:19.847
MARISHA: What was that demon guy we encountered?
Does he have a name?

01:56:19.847 --> 01:56:21.512
TALIESIN: Phil.

01:56:21.512 --> 01:56:23.199
SAM: You mean the pit fiend, or--?

01:56:23.199 --> 01:56:24.840
LAURA: Oh, you mean like Senokir?

01:56:24.840 --> 01:56:27.468
LIAM: No, he was a genasii.

01:56:27.468 --> 01:56:35.535
MARISHA: The pit fiend was a devil. Who was the
guy who lied to us, and you said devil at one

01:56:35.535 --> 01:56:38.232
point, and he was actually a demon.

01:56:38.232 --> 01:56:41.459
LAURA: You said he was a demon and he was actually
a devil.

01:56:41.459 --> 01:56:45.353
MATT: That was a glabrezu. That was what killed
Pike.

01:56:45.353 --> 01:56:47.359
TALIESIN: What about the basement way back when?

01:56:47.359 --> 01:56:48.409
TRAVIS: Where we found you?

01:56:48.409 --> 01:56:49.263
TALIESIN: Yeah, remember?

01:56:49.263 --> 01:56:50.379
LAURA: The succubus?

01:56:50.379 --> 01:56:52.233
MATT: That was after you found Percy. This was in
the palace of Emon.

01:56:52.233 --> 01:56:53.562
LAURA: What about the succubus?

01:56:53.562 --> 01:56:54.812
LIAM: The succubus. And that thing with the
bones.

01:56:54.812 --> 01:56:56.548
MARISHA: Succubus are-- yeah.

01:56:56.548 --> 01:56:57.717
LAURA: We did kill a succubus.

01:56:57.717 --> 01:56:58.496
MATT: You did, yeah.

01:56:58.496 --> 01:56:59.619
LIAM: In Krieg's house.

01:56:59.619 --> 01:57:00.780
MARISHA: And they're demons, right?

01:57:00.780 --> 01:57:05.813
MATT: They are fiends. You're not sure. You don't
have enough knowledge--

01:57:05.813 --> 01:57:07.929
Are you trained in religion?

01:57:07.929 --> 01:57:08.915
MARISHA: No.

01:57:08.915 --> 01:57:10.360
TALIESIN: But you could ask me. Well, I'm not--

01:57:10.360 --> 01:57:15.142
MATT: Yeah. You're not too familiar. Part of this
research is learning the distinguishing factors

01:57:15.142 --> 01:57:17.631
between fiends. You don't have a whole lot of
knowledge of that.

01:57:17.631 --> 01:57:20.809
MARISHA: Okay. You know what? You're reading the
book on the Nine Hells. That'll tell us what

01:57:20.809 --> 01:57:22.611
fiends there are.

01:57:22.611 --> 01:57:23.263
TALIESIN: All right.

01:57:23.263 --> 01:57:24.026
MARISHA: Right?

01:57:24.026 --> 01:57:24.852
MATT: Maybe.

01:57:24.852 --> 01:57:25.752
TALIESIN: Maybe. I'm reading the book.

01:57:25.752 --> 01:57:26.481
MARISHA: Read the book.

01:57:26.481 --> 01:57:27.226
MATT: Okay. There we go.

01:57:27.226 --> 01:57:29.607
(all laugh)

01:57:29.607 --> 01:57:31.735
LIAM: Saviors of the universe, we are.

01:57:31.829 --> 01:57:32.797
MATT: So.

01:57:32.797 --> 01:57:34.616
TALIESIN: Do you know the dewey decimal system?

01:57:34.616 --> 01:57:36.510
MARISHA: Yes. (laughs)

01:57:36.510 --> 01:57:39.031
MATT: What're you trying to find? Do you want to
just read all the information? It'll take you--

01:57:39.031 --> 01:57:41.969
TALIESIN: I'm skipping specifically through Orcus,
and also since she mentions what she's--

01:57:41.969 --> 01:57:43.368
MATT: There's no Orcus in this book. This is about
the Nine Hells.

01:57:43.368 --> 01:57:51.444
TALIESIN: Oh, I'm so sorry. Hierarchies. I'm
trying to get a general overlay of some of the

01:57:51.444 --> 01:57:57.425
information if there's a natural enemy for the
rakshasas.

01:57:57.425 --> 01:57:59.776
Any weaknesses, where we can find them.

01:57:59.776 --> 01:58:04.359
MATT: Okay. You do know there is a very strong
infernal hierarchy of all the hells.

01:58:04.359 --> 01:58:08.770
TALIESIN: I'm also seeing what the book also
specializes in.

01:58:08.826 --> 01:58:13.120
MATT: Yes, that's what it looks like as
he's reading.

01:58:13.175 --> 01:58:21.757
It's a very rigid power structure here. And
the whole purpose of most devils is to try and gain

01:58:21.820 --> 01:58:24.388
power and ascend their rank by proving themselves
stronger or

01:58:24.445 --> 01:58:26.595
tearing others down to take their position.

01:58:26.595 --> 01:58:29.210
TALIESIN: So anyone lower would be an enemy,
anyone higher would probably--

01:58:29.210 --> 01:58:33.971
MATT: Well, they'll work together because it is a
lawful evil society. It is a society that only

01:58:33.971 --> 01:58:36.846
functions because of its structure.

01:58:38.338 --> 01:58:41.284
So it is tyrant and underlings. And
underlings will work and serve things they hate

01:58:41.316 --> 01:58:47.600
that are more powerful in hope of gaining the
favor, especially since higher devils can bequeath

01:58:47.600 --> 01:58:50.434
lower devils the chance to ascend to a higher
tier.

01:58:50.434 --> 01:58:53.841
TALIESIN: Are there stories of anybody defeating a
rakshasa before?

01:58:53.841 --> 01:59:00.715
MATT: You glance through, and rakshasas, like any
other devil, can be killed. If you can go to it

01:59:00.715 --> 01:59:08.899
and kill it. But there are many tiers here. There
are archdevils at the top. That are the rulers of

01:59:08.899 --> 01:59:15.335
each-- essentially the top ranks. There are
greater devils below them. Greater devils include

01:59:15.335 --> 01:59:22.609
horned devils, erinyes, which you've encountered,
pit fiends, which you've encountered, and ice

01:59:22.609 --> 01:59:27.588
devils. And they are the greatest of the devils
below the archdevils. Then you have lesser devils,

01:59:27.588 --> 01:59:33.567
which are like imps, spine devils, bearded devils,
barbed devils, chain devils, bone devils. You've

01:59:33.567 --> 01:59:36.722
got all these names, you get some drawings and
sketches of some of these creatures, and they all

01:59:36.722 --> 01:59:49.221
look awful. Lowest in this rank are lemures.
Lemures are the souls of people that have passed,

01:59:49.399 --> 01:59:56.062
who have either done enough evil deeds that they
fall under the sway of one of the archdevils. Most

01:59:56.062 --> 02:00:01.149
of them are acquired by making a deal with a
devil. A contract. They're big into contracts.

02:00:01.209 --> 02:00:07.339
Their power structure is based on what sort of
souls, what power they can gain, what people they

02:00:07.339 --> 02:00:10.653
can sway, what people they can convince to--

02:00:10.726 --> 02:00:13.153
TALIESIN: Lemures are infernal Pokemon, is
basically what you're getting to.

02:00:13.153 --> 02:00:17.766
MATT: Yeah. Once a soul has come under the sway of
a devil and is brought to the Nine Hells, it

02:00:17.766 --> 02:00:26.215
either can become just a lost wandering soul used
as a source of energy; most of them convert into

02:00:26.215 --> 02:00:33.278
lemures which are the low-level slaves. They're
ever-tortured, flesh masses that--

02:00:33.278 --> 02:00:34.598
TALIESIN: So like The Scream?

02:00:34.598 --> 02:00:35.628
MATT: Yeah.

02:00:35.628 --> 02:00:43.267
They're the tortured souls of the Nine
Hells. If a lemure does manage to do good enough

02:00:43.317 --> 02:00:50.866
work over an extended period of time it can ascend
into a lesser devil, by pleasing its masters, by

02:00:50.915 --> 02:00:56.616
whatever it may be. There is a chance, that's how
devils ascending are brought to a higher station.

02:00:56.616 --> 02:00:57.939
TALIESIN: There's a few that have crawled their
way up.

02:00:57.939 --> 02:01:01.789
MATT: Yeah, and the pit fiend you killed probably
returned and got demoted.

02:01:01.789 --> 02:01:07.040
LAURA: Ooh, to a lesser? Like they get turned into
something smaller?

02:01:07.040 --> 02:01:10.138
MATT: If something really powerful and cool that
was given a station was suddenly walking through

02:01:10.138 --> 02:01:13.327
the street and killed by a bunch of people in the
city and came back and was like, "they killed me,"

02:01:13.327 --> 02:01:17.949
they'd be like, "you're weak obviously". Reading
the structure, you probably really ruined that

02:01:17.949 --> 02:01:19.841
guy's day. (laughs)

02:01:19.841 --> 02:01:24.255
TALIESIN: He's probably going to have centuries
getting his shit back together. He's probably

02:01:24.255 --> 02:01:25.587
really pissed.

02:01:25.587 --> 02:01:30.093
MATT: Yeah, you basically made him lose his house,
and his dog, and his wife. You turned him into a

02:01:30.093 --> 02:01:31.608
country song.

02:01:31.608 --> 02:01:34.201
TALIESIN: Do they talk about anything like the
children that we saved?

02:01:34.201 --> 02:01:40.858
The effect of angelic, angelic, why
those little angel children--

02:01:40.907 --> 02:01:45.650
MATT: There is very little talk about celestial
blood, divas, other than the fact that there's been

02:01:45.650 --> 02:01:53.401
a long-standing battle since the founding. Since
the prime gods and betrayer gods divided early in

02:01:53.401 --> 02:01:55.279
the creation of Exandria and--

02:01:55.279 --> 02:01:57.812
TALIESIN: There's no talk about using celestial
power as some sort of weapon

02:01:57.812 --> 02:02:00.825
against these creatures.

02:02:00.825 --> 02:02:07.110
MATT: Not celestial power necessarily, but some of
the entities are susceptible to various divine

02:02:07.110 --> 02:02:14.689
magics and abilities, and that is a strong back
and forth between the two sides. The big war is

02:02:14.689 --> 02:02:23.137
between the devils and the demons. The Abyss,
which is the nature of chaos and evil and driven

02:02:23.137 --> 02:02:31.556
hunger at whatever cost, versus the power-hungry
devils, which build structure, dominance,

02:02:31.556 --> 02:02:38.688
expanding their territory, and ruling through
structure and power.

02:02:38.688 --> 02:02:43.344
TALIESIN: Okay, so within evil, there is chaos
versus order is kind of the internal conflict of evil.

02:02:43.344 --> 02:02:45.293
MATT: Yes, those are the two sides, devils versus
demons.

02:02:45.293 --> 02:02:47.273
TALIESIN: All right. This is all very useful.

02:02:47.273 --> 02:02:50.699
MATT: But there are many tiers of the hells and
nine--

02:02:50.699 --> 02:02:56.398
MARISHA: Does it mention any Abyssal fiends that
they particularly hate

02:02:56.398 --> 02:02:59.966
that we might have encountered?

02:02:59.966 --> 02:03:02.611
TALIESIN: Flipping. I'm just going to keep
skimming.

02:03:02.611 --> 02:03:05.513
LIAM: While he's skimming could we jump back for
just thirty seconds?

02:03:05.513 --> 02:03:06.538
MATT: Sure.

02:03:06.538 --> 02:03:08.408
TALIESIN: Actually I'm happy to time-pass and
we'll revamp that.

02:03:08.408 --> 02:03:10.737
MATT: I just want to make sure that we don't get
lost on this somewhere.

02:03:10.737 --> 02:03:14.789
LIAM: Just 30 seconds before we go in, I'm like I
should have the book. I'll carry the book in, give

02:03:14.789 --> 02:03:16.220
me the book.

02:03:16.220 --> 02:03:17.842
LAURA: I thought you took the book.

02:03:17.842 --> 02:03:20.120
LIAM: I don't carry books.

02:03:20.120 --> 02:03:22.077
LAURA: No, you have the book. I thought you were
lying to the guy.

02:03:22.077 --> 02:03:25.205
You actually have the book, right?

02:03:25.205 --> 02:03:27.091
LIAM: You took the book when we left--

02:03:27.091 --> 02:03:29.516
LAURA: I didn't take the book, I thought you took
the book.

02:03:29.516 --> 02:03:30.586
LIAM: Are you fucking kidding me?

02:03:30.586 --> 02:03:32.160
LAURA: Are you fucking serious?

02:03:32.160 --> 02:03:33.942
LIAM: Fuck.

02:03:33.942 --> 02:03:36.784
TALIESIN: Can we direct people to the Benny Hill
steampunk theme song.

02:03:36.784 --> 02:03:38.173
MARISHA: (sings Yakety Sax)

02:03:38.173 --> 02:03:39.632
LAURA: Let's go to the library.

02:03:39.632 --> 02:03:41.259
MATT: All right, meanwhile.

02:03:41.259 --> 02:03:46.229
MARISHA: So were we supposed to take the book? Or
were they supposed to take the book?

02:03:46.229 --> 02:03:47.956
TALIESIN: I thought you said that we were taking
the book.

02:03:47.956 --> 02:03:51.172
MARISHA: Well, I also thought we were going to the
Reserve and now we're in the library.

02:03:51.172 --> 02:03:53.113
MATT: Are you unveiling the book?

02:03:53.113 --> 02:03:54.822
TALIESIN: No, we are not. We have it, we have not
unveiled it.

02:03:54.822 --> 02:03:56.034
LAURA: We're heading to the library.

02:03:56.034 --> 02:03:57.009
MATT: Okay.

02:03:57.009 --> 02:03:59.702
TALIESIN: I'm going to keep reading while they
head, you guys if you want to--

02:03:59.702 --> 02:04:02.181
MARISHA: I'm so confused on our plan.

02:04:02.252 --> 02:04:07.925
MATT: There are many things you learn. One, the
first layer of Avernus, which is the first layer

02:04:07.999 --> 02:04:16.214
of the hell. It is a terrible blackened rocky
wasteland, rivers of blood. It's a bad place.

02:04:16.214 --> 02:04:19.710
Usually, you have to travel from each layer into
the next one. There are very few portals that'll

02:04:19.710 --> 02:04:25.965
lead to the Hells. Usually, any that do start at
Inverness and you have to work your way in. That

02:04:26.017 --> 02:04:34.640
area is ruled by Zariel, which is the Archduchess
of Avernus. This is also the realm of Tiamat.

02:04:34.640 --> 02:04:37.793
TALIESIN: Ah, yeah, okay!

02:04:37.793 --> 02:04:40.378
MATT: You glancing through and trying to find
things that catch your attention. This is a large

02:04:40.378 --> 02:04:42.489
tome. You could spend days and
days researching this but you don't have a lot of

02:04:42.489 --> 02:04:47.926
time. You are looking for specific things. Dis is
the second layer of the Nine Hells. It is a

02:04:47.926 --> 02:04:53.367
labyrinth of canyons, wedged between sheer
mountains, filled with iron ore. There are iron

02:04:53.367 --> 02:04:57.902
roads that span through the canyons with a series
of bridges that lead over these giant crevasses

02:04:57.902 --> 02:05:07.259
and this dark landscape. The ruler of the second
layer and the lord currently is Dispater.

02:05:07.259 --> 02:05:08.345
TRAVIS: Dispater?

02:05:08.345 --> 02:05:09.660
MATT: Yes. Dispater, which is--

02:05:09.660 --> 02:05:10.862
LAURA: Similar to James Spader.

02:05:10.862 --> 02:05:11.609
LIAM: Yeah.

02:05:11.609 --> 02:05:12.895
(all laugh)

02:05:12.895 --> 02:05:17.454
MATT: Yeah. Just half-cousin. Talks kind of like
him, too, it's really creepy.

02:05:17.454 --> 02:05:19.957
MARISHA: So, it's the realm of Dis and the leader
is--

02:05:19.957 --> 02:05:21.225
TALIESIN and MARISHA: Dispater.

02:05:21.225 --> 02:05:22.337
MATT: Yeah.

02:05:22.337 --> 02:05:23.395
TALIESIN: They're not that clever.

02:05:23.395 --> 02:05:28.361
MARISHA: And the first layer of Hell is also
referred to as the layer of Inyimenemo-- what?

02:05:28.361 --> 02:05:29.311
MATT: Avernus.

02:05:29.311 --> 02:05:30.562
MARISHA: Avernus.

02:05:30.562 --> 02:05:37.066
MATT: However, what does catch your attention
immediately is on Dis there is a city called the

02:05:37.251 --> 02:05:49.275
Iron City of Dis that is a massive metropolis,
primarily where most extra-planar entities travel

02:05:49.275 --> 02:05:54.719
to do business. It is in many cases an open
market.

02:05:54.719 --> 02:05:56.954
TALIESIN: So, probably safer.

02:05:56.954 --> 02:06:04.097
MATT: It's one of the safer areas for a mortal to
walk through, comparatively-- it's still in one of

02:06:04.097 --> 02:06:10.099
the Hells. But because it is such a center for
business, it's a popular location for extra-planar

02:06:10.099 --> 02:06:16.829
travelers, it's a popular place for succubi,
incubi to travel, it's a popular place for

02:06:16.829 --> 02:06:27.988
rakshasas. It specifically brings up hags,
creatures that deal in business, deal in

02:06:27.988 --> 02:06:34.589
exchanges, deal in contracts. Beyond the usual
devil ones, a lot of them tend to go to the Iron

02:06:34.589 --> 02:06:35.962
City of Dis.

02:06:35.962 --> 02:06:39.316
TALIESIN: Okay. I'm marking that-- I'm putting a
pin on my Pinterest board.

02:06:39.316 --> 02:06:42.288
MARISHA: Atlas Obscura that shit.

02:06:42.288 --> 02:06:47.300
TALIESIN: Atlas Obscura the hell out of the City
of Dis.

02:06:47.300 --> 02:06:50.614
MATT: I can give you the rest of this to read on
the break, if you'd like because it's a lot of

02:06:50.614 --> 02:06:53.942
information, but that's the one that sticks out to
you.

02:06:53.942 --> 02:06:55.743
TALIESIN: I don't want to kill Travis.

02:06:55.743 --> 02:07:03.918
MATT: No. In looking specifically for the mention
of rakshasas, there are sections about the

02:07:03.918 --> 02:07:13.095
creatures and talking about their history and how
they originally stemmed from the Hells and burst

02:07:13.095 --> 02:07:18.527
out of the prime plane. It goes into their history
there, the rest of it doesn't have as much in

02:07:18.527 --> 02:07:22.288
correlation to where you would look for such a
creature. They do exist on

02:07:22.288 --> 02:07:24.115
multiple layers of the Hells.

02:07:24.115 --> 02:07:25.697
TALIESIN: City of Dis seems to be the winner.

02:07:25.697 --> 02:07:27.959
MATT: At the very least, a place where you can get
information that can lead you elsewhere.

02:07:27.959 --> 02:07:29.377
TALIESIN: I'm very excited.

02:07:29.377 --> 02:07:31.083
MARISHA: Any information on how to get there?

02:07:31.083 --> 02:07:33.764
LAURA and LIAM: (sing) We built Dis city on--

02:07:33.764 --> 02:07:36.158
TALIESIN: Inter-planar travel.

02:07:36.158 --> 02:07:41.773
MARISHA: I can Plane Shift there. I do a very
detailed look at what the

02:07:41.773 --> 02:07:44.483
Iron City of Dis seems like--

02:07:44.483 --> 02:07:46.689
TALIESIN: I'll sketch a little bit of it out of
the book, as well.

02:07:46.689 --> 02:07:53.467
MATT: Okay, cool. And there are some descriptors
in there, some mild sketches. One thing it does

02:07:53.467 --> 02:08:01.398
speak of is the Tower. The Iron Tower of Dispater
which is, essentially, this massive central

02:08:01.398 --> 02:08:08.303
structure to the city where the actual archdevil
himself looks down upon the city and keeps watch

02:08:08.303 --> 02:08:11.380
over most business that he can.

02:08:11.380 --> 02:08:12.854
LIAM: Great stealth roll.

02:08:12.854 --> 02:08:14.386
MATT: Good job, thank you.

02:08:14.386 --> 02:08:16.364
(all laugh)

02:08:16.364 --> 02:08:17.383
TALIESIN: Dagger, dagger.

02:08:17.383 --> 02:08:19.191
LIAM: Thank you.

02:08:19.191 --> 02:08:23.080
MATT: While you guys are completing your
research-- Taryon and Grog!

02:08:23.080 --> 02:08:26.696
What are you guys doing?

02:08:26.696 --> 02:08:29.161
SAM: Do you have the book?

02:08:29.161 --> 02:08:32.768
(all laugh)

02:08:32.768 --> 02:08:34.105
TRAVIS: Which book?

02:08:34.105 --> 02:08:37.792
SAM: Never mind. Let's go find a place to buy some
potions.

02:08:37.792 --> 02:08:41.608
TRAVIS: All right. Are you accustomed to buying
things?

02:08:41.608 --> 02:08:43.076
SAM: Very much so.

02:08:43.076 --> 02:08:45.993
TRAVIS: Oh. Do you have a personal shopper?

02:08:45.993 --> 02:08:48.095
SAM: I actually do, yes.

02:08:48.095 --> 02:08:50.540
TRAVIS: Nice. Well, show me how it's done.

02:08:50.540 --> 02:08:54.064
SAM: All right, I'll take you under my wing, so to
speak.

02:08:54.064 --> 02:08:57.460
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'm a bit big so I don't know how
you're going to do that.

02:08:57.460 --> 02:09:00.504
SAM: Doty, join us!

02:09:01.704 --> 02:09:09.097
MATT: And as you guys walk through the streets,
everyone stares. Partially because you are a

02:09:09.097 --> 02:09:19.055
bright shiny beacon of finely polished gems and
armor flanked by a massive bearded goliath and

02:09:19.055 --> 02:09:22.283
whatever the fuck Doty is.

02:09:23.119 --> 02:09:28.828
SAM: Hello, hi, greetings, good day, good
afternoon, don't mind them, they're my friends!

02:09:28.828 --> 02:09:31.455
Hahahaha!

02:09:31.455 --> 02:09:33.789
TRAVIS: Wow.

02:09:33.789 --> 02:09:39.192
MATT: About five minutes of walking before two
armored Bastions come up in their piecemeal

02:09:39.192 --> 02:09:45.029
leather and scale breastplate armor with their
heavy fur cloaks over their shoulders, holding

02:09:45.029 --> 02:09:47.766
spears. "You!"

02:09:47.766 --> 02:09:49.334
SAM: Uh!

02:09:49.334 --> 02:09:54.304
MATT: "You walk with strange company. What's your
business here in Vasselheim?"

02:09:54.304 --> 02:10:09.597
SAM: We are wandering merchants, trying to find
some textiles to buy to resell in other lands.

02:10:09.597 --> 02:10:17.386
That's all. Don't mind my traveling companions.
They're my protectors. I travel as a merchant with

02:10:17.386 --> 02:10:30.394
a lot of coin, so I found these two at a leper
colony and nursed them back to health. It was also

02:10:30.394 --> 02:10:42.594
a gym, a muscle-man place, so they're really buff.
But they're also lepers. And that explains their

02:10:42.594 --> 02:10:44.648
matted hair.

02:10:44.648 --> 02:10:47.755
MATT: Make a deception check, please.

02:10:47.755 --> 02:10:51.425
TALIESIN: You get to experience this as a normal
person now. I'm so excited.

02:10:51.425 --> 02:10:53.102
SAM: What, deception?

02:10:53.102 --> 02:10:53.932
MATT: Yeah.

02:10:53.932 --> 02:10:57.872
SAM: Ooh, I better use Luck. Ooh, no, that's
worse.

02:10:57.934 --> 02:11:00.073
(all laugh)

02:11:00.073 --> 02:11:03.570
SAM: So do I use the higher one, or just the
second one?

02:11:03.570 --> 02:11:06.407
MATT: I'll double check.

02:11:06.407 --> 02:11:10.623
LAURA: I think you have to use the second roll.

02:11:10.684 --> 02:11:12.884
SAM: Well, it don't matter.

02:11:12.933 --> 02:11:14.822
MATT: You choose.

02:11:14.822 --> 02:11:16.630
SAM: Okay, ten.

02:11:16.630 --> 02:11:20.281
MATT: Total of ten.

02:11:20.281 --> 02:11:22.376
SAM: Yeah.

02:11:22.376 --> 02:11:32.735
MATT: He leans in real fast. "Oh wow, that's got
to be unfortunate. Being so buff and so filled

02:11:32.735 --> 02:11:35.410
"with leprosy."

02:11:35.410 --> 02:11:46.202
SAM: It is their cross to bear. That's why this
one doesn't even talk, and this one is a leper of

02:11:46.202 --> 02:11:49.974
few words.

02:11:50.702 --> 02:11:55.927
MATT: He leans back, and the two guards watch you
and nod and step back

02:11:55.927 --> 02:11:57.602
to let you continue to pass.

02:11:57.602 --> 02:12:07.844
SAM: Thank you. Might I inquire from you fine
gentleman where we might find some medicine or

02:12:07.844 --> 02:12:19.137
healing potions? These lepers are set to relapse.
That way? All right. I'll head that way then. Good

02:12:19.137 --> 02:12:24.061
day to you. Keep warm.

02:12:24.061 --> 02:12:27.727
MATT: As you guys keep walking, they slowly close
behind you and just begin to follow from about 30

02:12:27.727 --> 02:12:29.011
feet back.

02:12:29.011 --> 02:12:31.866
TRAVIS: That was amazing. Have you ever lied to
anybody before?

02:12:31.866 --> 02:12:40.603
SAM: Never. I think I have a talent for it though.
I just felt the words coming out and I went with it.

02:12:40.603 --> 02:12:42.448
TRAVIS: It was a thrill, right?

02:12:42.448 --> 02:12:48.204
SAM: It was thrilling. It was exciting. And they
were going with it. They were eating it up. I had

02:12:48.204 --> 02:12:53.636
them right where I wanted them. I could've told
them fucking anything. It was great, right?

02:12:53.636 --> 02:12:54.879
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:12:54.879 --> 02:12:55.981
SAM: Wow.

02:12:55.981 --> 02:12:58.222
TRAVIS: On a scale from one to two, how do you
think it went?

02:12:58.222 --> 02:13:02.452
SAM: I mean, two's the higher of the two, right?
Oh, you don't know.

02:13:02.452 --> 02:13:06.161
(all laugh)

02:13:06.161 --> 02:13:07.684
SAM: I feel good.

02:13:07.684 --> 02:13:09.127
TRAVIS: Nice, yeah.

02:13:09.127 --> 02:13:13.407
SAM: Now, remember, if anyone asks you, just go
(moans in pain) "I'm a leper",

02:13:13.407 --> 02:13:15.157
or something like that.

02:13:15.157 --> 02:13:16.864
TRAVIS: (moans in pain) I'm a leper.

02:13:16.864 --> 02:13:17.917
SAM: That's good.

02:13:17.917 --> 02:13:20.563
TRAVIS: Yeah, good. Are they following us now?

02:13:20.563 --> 02:13:22.768
SAM: Oh, I hadn't looked.

02:13:22.768 --> 02:13:27.040
MATT: You turn around, right at them, and 30 feet
back they're walking and

02:13:27.040 --> 02:13:29.661
they just stop as you stop.

02:13:29.661 --> 02:13:31.237
TRAVIS: Still think it went well?

02:13:31.237 --> 02:13:33.555
SAM: (whispers) I think they're following us.

02:13:33.555 --> 02:13:34.790
TRAVIS: Really?

02:13:34.790 --> 02:13:35.875
SAM: What do we do?

02:13:35.875 --> 02:13:40.340
TRAVIS: You know, it was probably you told such a
good story, they're just fascinated by you now.

02:13:40.340 --> 02:13:42.893
SAM: What do I do? I've never been followed by
guards before.

02:13:42.893 --> 02:13:47.199
TRAVIS: You should probably act casual. Or you
could drop some money on the ground, and let all

02:13:47.199 --> 02:13:50.925
the people run and collect it, and make a
diversion. It's up to you.

02:13:50.925 --> 02:13:52.951
SAM: Are there people around?

02:13:52.951 --> 02:13:54.981
MATT: There's a few.

02:13:54.981 --> 02:13:59.365
TRAVIS: Just dump all your money on the ground.
They'll come out of the houses, the woodworks.

02:13:59.365 --> 02:14:06.875
SAM: I was warned about you and money. I won't
listen to that. But I will try to act casual. I

02:14:06.875 --> 02:14:16.366
will just take off my gigantic, diamond-encrusted
helmet. Let my hair down.

02:14:16.366 --> 02:14:18.611
TRAVIS: How long is his long, blonde hair?

02:14:18.611 --> 02:14:21.047
MATT: Just past the shoulders.

02:14:21.047 --> 02:14:23.809
TRAVIS: Just free-flowing? No fancy braids or buns
or anything?

02:14:23.809 --> 02:14:27.271
MATT: No, just free-flowing, perfectly arced in
the front, except pulled back because of the

02:14:27.271 --> 02:14:32.617
helmet. It's glorious. It's Bee Gee-tastic.

02:14:32.679 --> 02:14:34.961
SAM: (loudly) Ah, what a day, am I right?

02:14:34.961 --> 02:14:36.770
TRAVIS: You're talking real loud.

02:14:36.770 --> 02:14:38.175
SAM: (softly) That's what casual people do.

02:14:38.175 --> 02:14:39.201
TRAVIS: No. They don't.

02:14:39.201 --> 02:14:40.368
SAM: They don't care what people think.

02:14:40.368 --> 02:14:41.870
TRAVIS: Volume control, real important.

02:14:41.870 --> 02:14:48.437
SAM: Okay. (loudly) Ah, just want to take a load
off and just rest here for a while. Not going

02:14:48.437 --> 02:14:54.001
anywhere, just sitting here and acting real
boring, right?

02:14:54.001 --> 02:14:58.851
TRAVIS: Yep. How are we going to stay here and
find the health potions at the same time?

02:14:58.851 --> 02:15:01.054
SAM: Guide me. You've been doing this longer.

02:15:01.054 --> 02:15:06.247
TRAVIS: No, you're really doing well. I'm learning
a lot right now. Clearly, you are a well-traveled

02:15:06.247 --> 02:15:07.819
man of mystery.

02:15:07.819 --> 02:15:15.143
SAM: All right, I've read about situations like
this, right? We just need to create a diversion.

02:15:15.143 --> 02:15:18.452
While the guards are diverted, we run away, fast
as we can, right?

02:15:18.452 --> 02:15:20.718
TRAVIS: I literally told you about that one minute
ago.

02:15:20.718 --> 02:15:21.480
SAM: Yes.

02:15:21.480 --> 02:15:25.659
(all laugh)

02:15:25.659 --> 02:15:27.512
SAM: Here's my plan.

02:15:27.512 --> 02:15:30.020
MATT: Grog, make a perception check.

02:15:33.500 --> 02:15:34.800
TRAVIS: 15.

02:15:34.800 --> 02:15:40.355
MATT: You're getting close to the exterior of the
building pointed to by the guards, and you

02:15:40.355 --> 02:15:43.947
recognize it. It's the place where you've
previously purchased potions.

02:15:44.975 --> 02:15:50.023
TRAVIS: Look, I hate to interrupt, right. Do you
think you've done anything wrong?

02:15:50.023 --> 02:15:51.013
SAM: Illegal?

02:15:51.013 --> 02:15:52.762
TRAVIS: Yeah. Have you done anything wrong?

02:15:52.762 --> 02:15:54.097
SAM: I don't think so, no.

02:15:54.097 --> 02:15:55.620
TRAVIS: You've never been here before?

02:15:55.620 --> 02:16:00.527
SAM: Well, we are traveling around with an arcane
being. I don't know if that's illegal.

02:16:00.527 --> 02:16:06.287
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's totally fine. Look, this place
is where the goods are.

02:16:06.287 --> 02:16:10.011
SAM: You mean potions and magical items?

02:16:10.011 --> 02:16:14.979
TRAVIS: All sorts of stuff. I don't even know if
his inventory has improved since we've last been

02:16:14.979 --> 02:16:20.012
here, but he will give you a really great deal,
and it'll give you a chance to prove to me how

02:16:20.012 --> 02:16:22.563
good of a salesman you are.

02:16:22.563 --> 02:16:26.836
SAM: All right. But how do we shake the
uards-gay?

02:16:26.836 --> 02:16:28.194
TRAVIS: What?

02:16:28.194 --> 02:16:34.788
SAM: Well, that came out weird. Didn't think that
through.

02:16:34.788 --> 02:16:44.942
(all laugh)

02:16:44.942 --> 02:16:50.818
TRAVIS: I mean, the motherfucking pig-latin.
Jesus.

02:16:50.818 --> 02:16:58.062
SAM: What they do in the comfort of their own home
is their own--

02:16:58.062 --> 02:17:05.693
TRAVIS: I don't think there's any shaking them,
right. Why don't you leave old twinkle-toes

02:17:05.693 --> 02:17:12.241
outside, and we go in? Surely Doty can read or
something?

02:17:12.241 --> 02:17:16.483
SAM: He can stay here and keep watch, but if they
ask him anything, he will be--

02:17:16.483 --> 02:17:18.191
TRAVIS: Mute.

02:17:18.191 --> 02:17:20.249
SAM: Is that all right, do you think?

02:17:20.249 --> 02:17:21.703
TRAVIS: What's wrong with that?

02:17:21.703 --> 02:17:22.871
SAM: All right.

02:17:22.871 --> 02:17:26.939
TRAVIS: Maybe just tell him to be cool.

02:17:26.939 --> 02:17:28.424
SAM: Doty.

02:17:28.424 --> 02:17:32.860
MATT: Which, as you turn, you see he's been
drawing in his book the entire time, everything

02:17:32.860 --> 02:17:35.504
you guys have been discussing.

02:17:35.504 --> 02:17:44.844
SAM: Doty. Act cool. That means book down, don't
say a word, and if the guards get close, let us

02:17:44.844 --> 02:17:56.843
know with some sort of sound. Thank you. Remember,
you're a leper, so seem unhealthy.

02:17:56.843 --> 02:18:03.962
MATT: (lopsided mechanical footsteps) Horrible
creaking sounds.

02:18:03.962 --> 02:18:06.118
SAM: Good. All right, let's go inside.

02:18:06.118 --> 02:18:07.385
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:18:07.385 --> 02:18:11.289
MATT: So, the guards are closing the gap a little
bit. You guys pick up pace, they pick up pace a

02:18:11.289 --> 02:18:15.885
little bit. You get to the outside of the
building. The doors are closed. You open them and

02:18:15.885 --> 02:18:21.191
get inside. The warm interior is lit up. You can
see there's nobody else currently inside, except

02:18:21.191 --> 02:18:27.292
for your old friend, the potion-seller, who's
currently reading what looks to be some sort of

02:18:27.292 --> 02:18:32.495
a-- you're not actually sure what's inside the
book, but it's a small, handheld book, and he's

02:18:32.495 --> 02:18:36.999
reading through, bored. "No. No. No."

02:18:36.999 --> 02:18:45.586
TRAVIS: No, no. She's not here. It's just me and
my new, rich friend. Rich.

02:18:45.586 --> 02:18:48.470
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

02:18:49.137 --> 02:18:51.891
TRAVIS: Natural 20.

02:18:51.891 --> 02:18:53.034
MARISHA: Are you serious?

02:18:53.034 --> 02:18:55.454
TRAVIS: That's what it says.

02:18:55.702 --> 02:18:58.255
MATT: "She's not here?"

02:18:58.255 --> 02:19:00.651
TRAVIS: She's not here. It's just the two of us.

02:19:00.651 --> 02:19:02.103
MATT: "And your friend's very rich?"

02:19:02.103 --> 02:19:03.201
SAM: Extremely.

02:19:03.201 --> 02:19:06.929
TRAVIS: Do you see what he is covered in?

02:19:06.929 --> 02:19:10.656
MATT: "What is that?"

02:19:10.656 --> 02:19:13.812
SAM: Just outside the door there?

02:19:13.812 --> 02:19:16.635
MATT: "Yes."

02:19:16.635 --> 02:19:19.057
SAM: He's a man.

02:19:19.057 --> 02:19:20.097
MATT: "Great. Well then."

02:19:20.097 --> 02:19:25.140
(all laugh)

02:19:25.140 --> 02:19:29.555
TRAVIS: Nice. Slick.

02:19:29.555 --> 02:19:33.202
MATT: "So what can I get you? I've got all sorts
of salves and spices. We've got all sorts of

02:19:33.266 --> 02:19:35.793
"incense. What are you looking for?"

02:19:35.793 --> 02:19:40.297
TRAVIS: Inside the shop, has it grown or become
more ornate since we've last been here?

02:19:40.297 --> 02:19:44.283
MATT: It does, actually. Last time you were here
it was in the process of being put together. The

02:19:44.283 --> 02:19:50.448
shop seems to be fully open now and outfitted,
though it doesn't seem to be getting much traffic,

02:19:50.448 --> 02:19:59.506
as it is very empy. So he seems eager he has
customers. And now much more put at ease, now that

02:19:59.570 --> 02:20:04.902
you've let him know that from his vision, the
dragon woman did not come with you.

02:20:04.902 --> 02:20:10.542
TRAVIS: Yeah. (laughs) You first.

02:20:10.542 --> 02:20:19.532
SAM: Oh, for myself, do you have any spell
scrolls, or any sort of one-use items that I could

02:20:19.532 --> 02:20:27.465
use in a fight or a tangle with some bad chaps?

02:20:27.465 --> 02:20:31.441
MATT: "Let me see what I've got."

02:20:31.441 --> 02:20:35.743
SAM: Things that could deceive, things that could
use force against--

02:20:35.743 --> 02:20:48.773
MATT: And he rummages through a couple of scroll
pieces. Let's see here what he might have. "I do,

02:20:48.773 --> 02:20:58.652
"should you be so interested, currently carry one
scroll that would surround with you a wreath of

02:20:58.652 --> 02:21:00.645
"dangerous fire."

02:21:00.645 --> 02:21:06.760
SAM: Oh, all right. Just around me, or around an
area?

02:21:06.760 --> 02:21:11.698
MATT: "Just around you. Anything that came too
close would burst into flames and be burned."

02:21:11.698 --> 02:21:17.877
SAM: I have 13 of those right here. Do you have
anything else?

02:21:21.529 --> 02:21:22.983
TRAVIS: Not that that's not really impressive.

02:21:23.033 --> 02:21:24.428
SAM: It's really good.

02:21:24.428 --> 02:21:26.786
MATT: "I've got something that makes you jump."

02:21:26.786 --> 02:21:28.773
SAM: I've got that.

02:21:28.773 --> 02:21:30.838
MATT: "I've got something that makes you see in
the dark."

02:21:30.838 --> 02:21:32.956
SAM: Yeah, I have a light already.

02:21:32.956 --> 02:21:36.950
(all laugh)

02:21:36.950 --> 02:21:40.060
MATT: "What do you want?"

02:21:40.060 --> 02:21:45.180
SAM: All right, give me that one scroll, the fire
scroll. I could sell it and get something else.

02:21:45.180 --> 02:21:47.697
MATT: "All right."

02:21:47.697 --> 02:21:49.323
SAM: How much is that?

02:21:49.323 --> 02:21:52.911
MATT: I'm looking right now for the scroll that's
here.

02:21:52.911 --> 02:21:55.298
TRAVIS: You have to read the scroll, right?

02:21:55.298 --> 02:22:03.322
SAM: I could read it to you. If that's what you're
asking.

02:22:03.322 --> 02:22:10.490
MATT: He looks you over. "The scroll I would put
at a fair 6,000 gold pieces."

02:22:10.490 --> 02:22:19.745
SAM: (gulps) Watch how it's done. I'm going to put
an amount of gold on the table. I'd like you to

02:22:19.745 --> 02:22:29.609
consider it, and if it's to your liking, take it,
and if not, just shake your head. And I'll put 200

02:22:29.609 --> 02:22:56.710
gold on the table. I'll put 200 more. I'll put
2,000 more. And another 2,000.

02:22:56.710 --> 02:22:59.082
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

02:22:59.082 --> 02:23:00.591
TRAVIS: 4,400.

02:23:00.591 --> 02:23:04.624
SAM: 17. Plus seven! 24.

02:23:07.905 --> 02:23:10.621
MATT: Takes the gold.

02:23:10.621 --> 02:23:13.022
TRAVIS: Wow!

02:23:13.022 --> 02:23:15.330
SAM: Check and mate.

02:23:15.330 --> 02:23:17.526
TRAVIS: Check'n'mate?

02:23:17.526 --> 02:23:19.310
MATT: You now have a scroll of fire shield.

02:23:19.310 --> 02:23:24.432
SAM: Scroll of fire shield, excellent. I don't
know what that is.

02:23:24.432 --> 02:23:30.034
TRAVIS: Wow. Do you have anything that makes you
faster?

02:23:30.034 --> 02:23:32.361
MATT: "I said I have something that makes you
jump."

02:23:32.361 --> 02:23:40.778
TRAVIS: No. I'm pretty good at jumping. What about
regular healing potions?

02:23:40.778 --> 02:23:47.051
MATT: "That I've got! You cleared me out of my
other various vials last time."

02:23:47.102 --> 02:23:49.201
TRAVIS: No new exotics came in?

02:23:49.201 --> 02:23:54.285
MATT: "No, I'm waiting on-- Trade's been a little
slow. Looks like things are getting up in Emon, so

02:23:54.285 --> 02:23:58.781
"hopefully we'll have more soon. But for the time
being, I do have some more healing potions." And

02:23:58.781 --> 02:24:02.404
he goes into the back room, and you hear him
rummaging for a minute. You hear one crate fall

02:24:02.404 --> 02:24:06.483
over and a couple of things shatter. "Ah god
damn--". And eventually he comes back through the

02:24:06.483 --> 02:24:11.295
door, and he's holding in his arms a few clusters
of various glass vials. Some of them have been

02:24:11.295 --> 02:24:16.506
repurposed and taped at the top, but they're
functional. He sets them down on the counter. "All

02:24:16.506 --> 02:24:31.219
"right. I have six potions of healing, and I have
three of greater healing, and one superior."

02:24:31.219 --> 02:24:33.827
SAM: Do I know how much these things tend to
cost?

02:24:33.827 --> 02:24:36.374
MATT: Make an intelligence check.

02:24:36.374 --> 02:24:41.408
SAM: Ooh! This is not a save.

02:24:41.408 --> 02:24:45.373
MATT: Yes, just add your modifier.

02:24:45.891 --> 02:24:47.891
SAM: 20!

02:24:47.891 --> 02:24:55.420
MATT: Yes, actually. The healing potions
can range around 75 to 100 gold pieces generally.

02:24:55.630 --> 02:25:06.434
The uncommon ones can range somewhere in the 500
gold pieces range. The superior, however, are much

02:25:06.434 --> 02:25:11.583
rarer to come by, and the fact he even has one,
with how recently you guys cleared him out, it's

02:25:11.583 --> 02:25:16.631
pretty decent. That one can run anywhere between
4,000-5,000 gold pieces.

02:25:16.631 --> 02:25:19.324
SAM: And it's six, three, and one? Is that right?

02:25:19.324 --> 02:25:22.240
MATT: Six, three, and one.

02:25:22.698 --> 02:25:26.476
TRAVIS: Do you want to get them? It seems like you
got all the money in the world.

02:25:26.476 --> 02:25:31.734
SAM: I can heal myself just fine, but I don't know
about your friends--

02:25:31.734 --> 02:25:34.954
do they have healing abilities?

02:25:34.954 --> 02:25:39.292
TRAVIS: No, not-- well they do, they touch you
with their hand and then like all of a sudden it

02:25:39.292 --> 02:25:40.821
feels a bit better.

02:25:40.821 --> 02:25:41.791
SAM: A bit better?

02:25:41.791 --> 02:25:43.323
TRAVIS: Yeah. I don't really know how that works.

02:25:43.323 --> 02:25:45.548
SAM: But they use potions. I've seen them use
potions.

02:25:45.548 --> 02:25:48.354
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'm normally pouring them in their
mouths.

02:25:48.919 --> 02:25:52.380
SAM: Do you think they would appreciate these?

02:25:52.380 --> 02:26:01.274
TRAVIS: I don't know, I hadn't thought that far.
As a (mumbling) new member of Vox Machina--

02:26:01.274 --> 02:26:02.860
SAM: What was that?

02:26:02.860 --> 02:26:07.542
TRAVIS: Bad allergies here. It could be like a
really great gift, you know?

02:26:07.542 --> 02:26:10.379
Like Keyleth gave you.

02:26:10.379 --> 02:26:12.109
SAM: -- welcome-me-to-the-gang gift.

02:26:12.109 --> 02:26:14.001
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:26:14.001 --> 02:26:17.864
SAM: Do you gift-wrap, here, sir?

02:26:17.864 --> 02:26:22.689
MATT: "For an additional charge, yes, of course, I
gift wrap!"

02:26:22.689 --> 02:26:30.455
SAM: -- of course for an additional charge. What
if we took the whole lot of those for 6,000 gold?

02:26:31.760 --> 02:26:38.027
MATT: "The whole lot? For 6,000. I'm afraid that
is far under the price I'd be considering. Let me

02:26:38.027 --> 02:26:47.222
"see here." And he does some kind of notations, and
he goes, "Hm. You seem, from our previous

02:26:47.222 --> 02:26:52.521
"experience, to be quite the bargainer, my
friend."

02:26:52.521 --> 02:26:54.419
TRAVIS: Yeah, the brains.

02:26:54.419 --> 02:27:00.202
MATT: "How would you say to the fair price of
10,000 gold pieces for the batch?"

02:27:02.263 --> 02:27:09.721
TRAVIS: Let me confer with my partner. (whispers)
How many on your hands is that? Yeah, no-- both

02:27:09.721 --> 02:27:11.334
hands, how many?

02:27:11.334 --> 02:27:12.520
SAM: All.

02:27:12.520 --> 02:27:13.612
TRAVIS: Two?

02:27:13.612 --> 02:27:15.075
SAM: Oh. Wait.

02:27:15.075 --> 02:27:18.714
(all laugh)

02:27:18.714 --> 02:27:20.016
SAM: It's too much.

02:27:20.016 --> 02:27:21.199
TRAVIS: Too much.

02:27:21.199 --> 02:27:26.889
SAM: Yes. This man is insulting your intelligence,
and you should be very angry right now.

02:27:28.847 --> 02:27:43.574
TRAVIS: How about 9,000 gold pieces?

02:27:43.574 --> 02:27:53.484
MATT: "Mm, you drive a very hard bargain, my big
friend, however! Because it's you? Deal."

02:27:53.484 --> 02:27:55.132
TRAVIS: Done! Pay the man.

02:27:55.132 --> 02:28:03.431
SAM: I would object to this. This is coming out of
my purse, and I insist that you negotiate with me,

02:28:03.431 --> 02:28:06.277
and not--

02:28:06.277 --> 02:28:11.849
TRAVIS: Tary, this man drives a really well-known
establishment. If we leave here, after having

02:28:11.849 --> 02:28:17.563
struck that bargain, and we don't pay? There will
be more guards outside.

02:28:17.563 --> 02:28:27.479
SAM: (gulps) How about this. I can trade you
something worth far more than the extra 3,000 gold

02:28:27.479 --> 02:28:31.210
this gentleman promised you.

02:28:31.210 --> 02:28:34.702
MATT: "What would this be?"

02:28:34.702 --> 02:28:49.834
SAM: It's a rare egg. Magical in nature. It can
save a life, in any situation. And if you eat it

02:28:49.834 --> 02:28:58.129
when you are nearly dead, you will go back into
battle with the strength and bravery of ten men,

02:28:58.129 --> 02:29:02.156
and you will not rest until your foes are dead.

02:29:03.722 --> 02:29:07.245
MATT: Make a persuasion check. This isn't
deception because you believe this

02:29:07.245 --> 02:29:08.912
wholeheartedly.

02:29:08.912 --> 02:29:13.026
SAM: Is this deception or persuasion?

02:29:13.026 --> 02:29:14.525
MATT: This is persuasion.

02:29:14.525 --> 02:29:16.142
SAM: 22.

02:29:25.297 --> 02:29:36.237
MATT: "6,000 and the egg, you say? Very well." He
pushes the--

02:29:36.237 --> 02:29:37.776
SAM: Gentle!

02:29:37.776 --> 02:29:48.750
MATT: "I will be." He goes over and quickly
reaches over and grabs a thick towel-like pile of

02:29:48.750 --> 02:29:57.256
cloth, and wraps it up carefully. "Ooh." Sets it
down. "A pleasure doing business with you all."

02:29:57.256 --> 02:30:00.640
SAM: Ah-ah-ah. The gift-wrapping?

02:30:00.640 --> 02:30:03.645
(all laugh)

02:30:03.697 --> 02:30:10.087
MATT: "Terribly sorry. My apologies. I'll be right
to it." And he turns and leaves the room.

02:30:10.087 --> 02:30:14.921
TRAVIS: Tary, that was a personal gift from me to
you.

02:30:15.604 --> 02:30:22.496
SAM: I know, but we're partners, as you just said,
and I felt that you would approve of me doing so.

02:30:23.113 --> 02:30:26.690
TRAVIS: I suppose I am a bit proud.

02:30:27.707 --> 02:30:29.613
MATT: (loud clanging)

02:30:29.613 --> 02:30:30.734
SAM: What was that?

02:30:30.734 --> 02:30:32.075
MATT: You hear behind you guys in the doorway--

02:30:32.075 --> 02:30:33.066
SAM: Oh shit. Oh shit.

02:30:33.066 --> 02:30:35.936
MATT: -- some of the impacts of metal, rapidly and
heavily.

02:30:35.936 --> 02:30:37.549
TRAVIS: What?

02:30:37.549 --> 02:30:38.458
SAM: Sword!

02:30:38.458 --> 02:30:39.664
TRAVIS: Oh Jesus.

02:30:39.664 --> 02:30:46.585
MATT: You watch, (whoosh), whips into a longsword.
And you glance behind and you see, walking through

02:30:46.585 --> 02:30:51.753
the doorway, the very heavy, hulking figure of
Doty, carrying two unconscious guards that are

02:30:51.753 --> 02:30:53.387
hanging from his hands.

02:30:53.387 --> 02:30:55.589
SAM: Oh shit.

02:30:55.589 --> 02:31:04.486
TRAVIS: What did you do? Give me those! I punch
them both, one time each, in the jaw, just for

02:31:04.486 --> 02:31:06.718
extra measure.

02:31:07.818 --> 02:31:12.376
MATT: Okay. Both jaws are very broken.

02:31:13.210 --> 02:31:16.841
TRAVIS: Your guy really did a number. Cool. Okay.

02:31:16.841 --> 02:31:19.952
(all laugh)

02:31:19.952 --> 02:31:23.538
TRAVIS: Everybody's going to die, all right? So
we're going to kill everyone that we see in the

02:31:23.538 --> 02:31:24.565
next ten seconds.

02:31:24.565 --> 02:31:25.956
SAM: Wait, we're killing them? Even the shop
owner?

02:31:25.956 --> 02:31:27.270
TRAVIS: Yeah, he's got to die.

02:31:27.270 --> 02:31:31.820
SAM: Oh shit. All right. Partners, right? I'll do
whatever you say.

02:31:31.820 --> 02:31:33.848
TRAVIS: Is there a counter in the shop?

02:31:33.848 --> 02:31:35.950
MATT: Yeah, there's a counter in the front area.

02:31:35.950 --> 02:31:37.199
TRAVIS: Is it wooden?

02:31:37.199 --> 02:31:38.090
MATT: Yeah.

02:31:38.090 --> 02:31:39.142
TRAVIS: Can he see through the counter?

02:31:39.142 --> 02:31:42.131
MATT: No, the proprietor is in the back room. He's
wrapping your stuff right now.

02:31:42.131 --> 02:31:45.167
SAM: He doesn't know this happened. Let's get rid
of them. Get rid of them.

02:31:45.167 --> 02:31:49.067
TRAVIS: Well, what's in the shop? Is there a
tapestry, is there a rug?

02:31:49.067 --> 02:31:52.126
MATT: It's not a very big-- There is a secondary
room to the side where it looks like there is an

02:31:52.126 --> 02:31:54.889
upper platform, but that looks like where his
bedroom is, maybe.

02:31:54.889 --> 02:31:56.019
TRAVIS: Uh-huh.

02:31:56.019 --> 02:31:58.668
MATT: There's a couple of lanterns, it's a
warm-lit interior, and as you're looking around,

02:31:58.668 --> 02:32:03.243
it's not a huge establishment. Make a perception
check.

02:32:05.908 --> 02:32:07.567
TRAVIS: Yeah. Two.

02:32:07.567 --> 02:32:09.422
MATT: You have no idea! You're panicking.

02:32:09.422 --> 02:32:12.762
TRAVIS: I saw this in a tavern once. Let's sit
them up like they're just sleeping

02:32:12.762 --> 02:32:15.537
and nobody will notice.

02:32:15.537 --> 02:32:20.043
SAM: They have jaws-- the blood! Their jaws are
terrible!

02:32:20.043 --> 02:32:23.020
TRAVIS: Well, didn't you put a mask on Dotty?
Let's do it again.

02:32:23.020 --> 02:32:25.010
SAM: I can't! I don't have extra masks.

02:32:25.010 --> 02:32:26.407
TRAVIS: No, it will be no problem.

02:32:26.407 --> 02:32:28.416
SAM: We can put them somewhere else.

02:32:28.416 --> 02:32:32.355
TRAVIS: I sit one up in the corner, and I sit the
other one, and lean it on his shoulder.

02:32:32.355 --> 02:32:34.645
MATT: Okay.

02:32:34.934 --> 02:32:37.900
SAM: Oh my god. What?

02:32:37.900 --> 02:32:39.305
TRAVIS: This is great. Don't worry.

02:32:39.305 --> 02:32:41.837
SAM: Even I can tell that those are two--

02:32:41.837 --> 02:32:44.897
TRAVIS: I have an even better idea! I take the
cask of ale out of the bag of holding, and I just

02:32:44.897 --> 02:32:47.614
start pouring ale all over them.

02:32:47.614 --> 02:32:50.045
SAM: Why would they be in here drinking? They're
guards on duty!

02:32:50.045 --> 02:32:53.589
TRAVIS: They're terrible guards. They make
horrible life choices. They're in the wrong line

02:32:53.589 --> 02:32:58.944
of work. I take two chalices and I throw it in
their laps. Cool.

02:32:58.944 --> 02:33:01.054
Now I need you to vomit on them.

02:33:01.054 --> 02:33:03.258
SAM: I can't vomit.

02:33:03.258 --> 02:33:06.675
TRAVIS: Do it right now. Put your finger down your
throat and puke on these guards.

02:33:06.675 --> 02:33:09.171
MATT: Make an intimidation check, Grog.

02:33:11.167 --> 02:33:14.002
TRAVIS: 17! Puke on those fucking guards!

02:33:14.002 --> 02:33:14.919
SAM: What do I roll?

02:33:14.919 --> 02:33:19.376
MATT: I'm going to say, make an insight check.
Sure.

02:33:19.376 --> 02:33:21.166
SAM: 16.

02:33:21.166 --> 02:33:26.208
TRAVIS: Vomit on those bitches.

02:33:26.208 --> 02:33:31.375
SAM: (dry heaving)

02:33:31.375 --> 02:33:33.337
MATT: And that's going to be giffed forever.

02:33:33.337 --> 02:33:39.224
(all laugh)

02:33:39.224 --> 02:33:43.485
MATT: Make a constitution saving throw.

02:33:43.485 --> 02:33:46.168
SAM: Natural 20.

02:33:46.168 --> 02:33:52.960
MATT: About 30 seconds of you trying to gag
yourself pass, before the shop owner comes back,

02:33:52.960 --> 02:33:58.427
with these beautifully packaged healing potions.
"All right, so--"

02:33:58.427 --> 02:34:01.324
SAM: One second! One second.

02:34:01.324 --> 02:34:06.551
TRAVIS: I'm really sorry. These two gentlemen
obviously have been off their ass. They came in

02:34:06.551 --> 02:34:11.813
here, smelling of booze, looking for something to
make them feel better, I don't know, and they just

02:34:11.813 --> 02:34:15.934
passed out in the corner. Is there someone you
know that we can call? I really hate just leaving

02:34:15.934 --> 02:34:17.067
them here.

02:34:17.067 --> 02:34:18.578
MATT: Make a deception check.

02:34:18.578 --> 02:34:21.430
MARISHA: Oh my god. Come on, Grog!

02:34:21.430 --> 02:34:22.532
TALIESIN: Please a four.

02:34:22.532 --> 02:34:23.680
TRAVIS: Nine.

02:34:23.680 --> 02:34:25.060
TALIESIN: Yes!

02:34:25.060 --> 02:34:32.192
MATT: He slowly hands out this really nice bundle,
and it has a little bow on it and it's wrapped,

02:34:32.192 --> 02:34:41.796
and he hands it out to you and just goes, "Please,
take this and never come back. Please."

02:34:41.796 --> 02:34:42.930
TRAVIS: For the rest of the day?

02:34:42.930 --> 02:34:50.475
MATT: "Ever again. Your presence has brought me no
end of pain. Just go."

02:34:50.762 --> 02:34:54.559
TRAVIS: Obviously, we've gotten the better end of
this deal.

02:34:54.559 --> 02:34:58.186
SAM: I think that that is true, absolutely.

02:34:58.186 --> 02:34:59.171
TRAVIS: Do you still have the--

02:34:59.171 --> 02:35:00.322
MATT: "Go!"

02:35:00.322 --> 02:35:01.582
TRAVIS: We should go. We should leave.

02:35:01.582 --> 02:35:04.087
SAM: All right. Thank you for your--

02:35:04.087 --> 02:35:06.921
MATT: (incoherent noises)

02:35:06.921 --> 02:35:10.466
SAM: Good day to you. Let's go. Doty, come.

02:35:10.466 --> 02:35:11.540
TRAVIS: Bidet.

02:35:11.540 --> 02:35:21.200
MATT: Doty turns. "Ahh!" And comes running after
you guys as you exit the shop.

02:35:21.200 --> 02:35:22.379
LIAM: Holy shit.

02:35:22.379 --> 02:35:24.266
TALIESIN: That was amazing. I don't feel good.

02:35:24.266 --> 02:35:26.898
MARISHA: Wow.

02:35:26.898 --> 02:35:30.945
TRAVIS: Good job. We've got to go. We've got to
hole up somewhere for a minute.

02:35:30.945 --> 02:35:32.371
You know. A drink?

02:35:32.371 --> 02:35:33.891
SAM: Please.

02:35:33.891 --> 02:35:36.870
TRAVIS: Yeah. Is there a tavern near this shop?

02:35:36.870 --> 02:35:38.806
MATT: In the Quad Roads? Yeah. There's actually
quite a few taverns.

02:35:38.806 --> 02:35:41.057
SAM: As soon as we step outside, I barf all over
the floor.

02:35:41.057 --> 02:35:42.899
(all laugh)

02:35:42.899 --> 02:35:44.986
TRAVIS: Where was that? What the fuck?

02:35:44.986 --> 02:35:47.735
SAM: I'm sorry. It just comes naturally. I can't
force it.

02:35:47.735 --> 02:35:54.634
TRAVIS: You can't perform on command? I needed
you. Okay, you got more in there?

02:35:54.634 --> 02:35:55.545
SAM: No.

02:35:55.545 --> 02:35:56.398
TRAVIS: It's just a one-er?

02:35:56.398 --> 02:35:57.483
SAM: Maybe a little.

02:35:57.483 --> 02:35:58.373
TRAVIS: Okay.

02:35:58.373 --> 02:35:59.646
SAM: (barfs)

02:35:59.646 --> 02:36:02.529
TRAVIS: Okay. That looks like Lucky Charms.

02:36:02.529 --> 02:36:08.122
MATT: Okay. While you guys get a drink, we're
going to get a quick bathroom break. We have a

02:36:08.122 --> 02:36:10.824
couple more beats we want to get through before
the night's end. We're not going to go too long,

02:36:10.824 --> 02:36:13.885
trust me. But we're going to take a quick bathroom
break, and then we'll come back here in a few

02:36:13.885 --> 02:36:19.004
minutes. We do have one more giveaway here tonight
from our awesome friends at Wyrmwood. We have a

02:36:19.004 --> 02:36:28.531
dice box here, signed by the cast of Critical
Role. It is a birch dice box. Do we have a code

02:36:28.531 --> 02:36:31.385
for the chat room?

02:36:32.187 --> 02:36:33.487
CREW: Wyrmwood!

02:36:33.487 --> 02:36:37.696
MATT: Wyrmwood. Go ahead and use, one word,
Wyrmwood, in the chat room on Twitch. We'll have a

02:36:37.696 --> 02:36:41.736
break, and we'll have a winner announced for you
when we get back.

02:36:41.736 --> 02:36:43.386
MARISHA: Wyrmwood with a 'y'.

02:36:43.386 --> 02:36:47.011
MATT: Yes, Wyrmwood with a 'y', as in the actual
company. Thank you guys so much. We'll see you in

02:36:47.011 --> 02:36:48.326
a few minutes.

02:36:48.326 --> 02:51:34.474
[break]

02:51:34.527 --> 02:51:37.264
MATT: Welcome back, everyone. So, first and
foremost, we have our winner in the chat room.

02:51:37.264 --> 02:51:42.317
'OnlyTwentiesAllowed'. Great name, by the way. You
won the contest for this week. We're going to go

02:51:42.317 --> 02:51:46.176
ahead and get your information, and send you your
Wyrmwood box. Thank you again, Wyrmwood, for

02:51:46.176 --> 02:51:51.941
sending that so we can get that to you guys for
free as the contest weekly. Back into the story we

02:51:51.941 --> 02:51:56.789
were. So, you guys are drinking and laying low.

02:51:56.789 --> 02:51:57.950
TRAVIS: Yep.

02:51:57.950 --> 02:51:59.900
MATT: You guys were making your way to the
library, you said?

02:51:59.900 --> 02:52:00.868
LAURA: Yes.

02:52:00.868 --> 02:52:01.760
MATT: Okay.

02:52:01.760 --> 02:52:03.515
MARISHA: We're going to finish up and try and get
out, I guess?

02:52:03.515 --> 02:52:04.454
MATT: Okay.

02:52:04.454 --> 02:52:09.560
TALIESIN: I would also like to definitely talk
about maybe having access later, to come back at

02:52:09.560 --> 02:52:10.952
some point.

02:52:10.952 --> 02:52:12.867
MARISHA: We want to talk to Kusuo and see.

02:52:12.867 --> 02:52:14.263
TALIESIN: Just on our way out.

02:52:14.263 --> 02:52:19.582
MATT: On the way out, as the tomes are placed
and locked back up, you talk to Kusuo. "That is not a

02:52:19.582 --> 02:52:22.770
"worry. Just make sure that you request me when you
arrive."

02:52:22.842 --> 02:52:23.803
MARISHA: Okay.

02:52:23.803 --> 02:52:25.076
MATT: "It would be my pleasure."

02:52:25.076 --> 02:52:29.571
TALIESIN: Thank you so much. And I hope that that
book finds a proper home and is worthwhile. Thank

02:52:29.571 --> 02:52:30.708
you for your time.

02:52:30.708 --> 02:52:37.079
MARISHA: Thank you. And would it be possible if we
bring friends of ours in the future who are--

02:52:37.079 --> 02:52:40.330
TALIESIN: Of our group.

02:52:40.330 --> 02:52:44.703
MARISHA: Yeah, who are fluent in these languages.

02:52:44.703 --> 02:52:47.322
MATT: "But of course. Just make sure that you
accompany them."

02:52:47.322 --> 02:52:48.270
TALIESIN: Of course.

02:52:48.270 --> 02:52:49.672
MARISHA: Thank you.

02:52:49.672 --> 02:52:56.521
MATT: He leads you out. You guys exit the library
just as Vax and Vex, after finding information on

02:52:56.521 --> 02:52:58.943
where to go, arrive.

02:52:58.943 --> 02:53:00.204
LAURA: Do you guys have the book?

02:53:00.204 --> 02:53:00.894
TALIESIN: We do.

02:53:00.894 --> 02:53:01.917
MARISHA: We totally do.

02:53:01.917 --> 02:53:02.933
LAURA: What the fuck?

02:53:02.933 --> 02:53:05.988
MARISHA: I know-- I thought-- You know, I think--
I don't know.

02:53:05.988 --> 02:53:07.381
LAURA: What did you find?

02:53:07.381 --> 02:53:10.540
MARISHA: Well, some good stuff.

02:53:10.540 --> 02:53:12.396
TALIESIN: It actually went quite well.

02:53:12.396 --> 02:53:13.279
LAURA: All right.

02:53:13.279 --> 02:53:16.195
MARISHA: We found one book that we could read, and
one book that we couldn't.

02:53:16.195 --> 02:53:17.593
LAURA: Okay.

02:53:17.593 --> 02:53:21.353
MARISHA: So we'll have to come back with you guys.
Because it was all written in Abyssal.

02:53:21.353 --> 02:53:22.507
LAURA: We can read that!

02:53:22.507 --> 02:53:25.383
MARISHA: Yes! Because your father forced you to do
things.

02:53:25.383 --> 02:53:29.838
TALIESIN: Don't they all. Speaking of fathers
forcing you to do things, we have to deal with

02:53:29.838 --> 02:53:34.442
you. We have a starting point for the rakshasa.

02:53:34.495 --> 02:53:35.924
LAURA: Wonderful.

02:53:35.924 --> 02:53:42.392
TALIESIN: So, soon, when it's time, step one will
be the City of Dis.

02:53:42.392 --> 02:53:44.143
LAURA: The City of Dis?

02:53:44.143 --> 02:53:46.634
TALIESIN: Dis City. Not this city, but the City of
Dis.

02:53:46.634 --> 02:53:47.481
LAURA: Okay.

02:53:47.481 --> 02:53:49.379
MARISHA: We built Dis city.

02:53:49.379 --> 02:53:51.504
TALIESIN: Did you build Dis city?

02:53:51.504 --> 02:53:53.047
MARISHA: On rock'n'roll.

02:53:53.121 --> 02:53:54.470
LIAM: Can I have that book please?

02:53:54.470 --> 02:53:56.591
TALIESIN: Oh, yes! Hi. Yes, this is-- Yes.

02:53:56.591 --> 02:53:59.636
LIAM: I'm just going to hold on to that.

02:53:59.636 --> 02:54:02.639
TALIESIN: Are you going to hold on-- Do we have a
bag to put that in?

02:54:02.639 --> 02:54:07.066
LAURA: We have Grog's bag of holding, the same one
we've always had. Hey, is there somewhere we could

02:54:07.120 --> 02:54:09.687
buy a fucking bag of holding?

02:54:09.687 --> 02:54:11.593
TRAVIS: They're kind of rare.

02:54:11.593 --> 02:54:14.621
MATT: They're not expensive.

02:54:14.621 --> 02:54:16.390
TRAVIS: To Grog, they're rare.

02:54:16.390 --> 02:54:19.892
MATT: But you could ask around and try to find
somebody. It'll take a little time. You guys are

02:54:19.892 --> 02:54:24.659
right now hitting the cusp of dawn. Sorry, dusk.

02:54:24.659 --> 02:54:28.546
LAURA: Is there somewhere I could find before
things close? Just to see?

02:54:28.546 --> 02:54:31.249
MATT: Make an investigation check.

02:54:33.624 --> 02:54:38.003
LAURA: Oh, balls. That's terrible.

02:54:38.003 --> 02:54:39.155
MATT: What did you roll?

02:54:39.155 --> 02:54:40.823
LAURA: I rolled 13.

02:54:40.823 --> 02:54:44.385
MATT: You manage to find one location, but it's
been closed for half an hour when you get there.

02:54:44.385 --> 02:54:46.700
LAURA: Fuck! Fuck. Fine. It's fine.

02:54:46.700 --> 02:54:48.987
TALIESIN: It's in Los Angeles.

02:54:48.987 --> 02:54:49.913
TRAVIS: Pittsburgh.

02:54:49.913 --> 02:54:51.680
MARISHA: Pittsburgh, yeah.

02:54:51.680 --> 02:54:52.956
LAURA: Keyleth?

02:54:52.956 --> 02:54:53.560
MARISHA: Yeah?

02:54:53.560 --> 02:54:57.198
LAURA: How about we go see your dad.

02:54:57.198 --> 02:54:59.882
MARISHA: (laughs nervously)

02:54:59.882 --> 02:55:03.320
LIAM: Are we tabling the book, then?

02:55:03.320 --> 02:55:05.463
TALIESIN: We're going to drop it off, I think.

02:55:05.518 --> 02:55:09.359
MARISHA: What did you guys find out? Is it a good
spot, a good home for it?

02:55:09.359 --> 02:55:10.849
Do you want to drop it off?

02:55:10.849 --> 02:55:14.841
LAURA: They definitely are interested in it at the
Platinum Sanctuary.

02:55:14.841 --> 02:55:17.902
LIAM: A little too interested for my taste.

02:55:17.902 --> 02:55:19.367
TALIESIN: You think?

02:55:19.367 --> 02:55:25.840
LIAM: Yes. I don't want this book in anyone's
hands, frankly.

02:55:25.840 --> 02:55:29.782
LAURA: They were very interested in researching
it. Which I don't think is a bad thing. They're

02:55:29.782 --> 02:55:36.168
good people. And learning about history is a good
way to keep yourself from repeating it. However,

02:55:36.168 --> 02:55:45.857
you do serve the Raven Queen, who I know wants
nothing to do with the undead. And if it means

02:55:45.857 --> 02:55:50.309
destroying this book, then do what needs to be
done.

02:55:50.309 --> 02:55:52.925
TALIESIN: Can we destroy this book?

02:55:52.925 --> 02:55:56.961
MARISHA: It's like our magical items. It's not
easy to destroy them.

02:55:56.961 --> 02:56:00.235
Seems like a pretty powerful book.

02:56:00.235 --> 02:56:03.937
TALIESIN: The fear I have with the book is of
course if we keep it, we keep it out of the hands

02:56:03.937 --> 02:56:09.652
of everyone, save those who are finally strong
enough to best us.

02:56:10.035 --> 02:56:13.017
LIAM: Do we want this book to travel to hell?

02:56:13.017 --> 02:56:14.447
MARISH: Ooh, no.

02:56:14.447 --> 02:56:17.164
TALIESIN: No, no.

02:56:17.164 --> 02:56:23.672
MARISHA: But it might not be a bad-- I mean, we
did drop off the horn of Orcus here.

02:56:23.672 --> 02:56:30.003
LIAM: I'll tell you what. Why don't you guys get
everything set to go, and I will drop this off.

02:56:30.003 --> 02:56:34.805
MARISHA: What? Where? There? Where?

02:56:34.805 --> 02:56:38.750
TALIESIN: Oh. Oh.

02:56:38.750 --> 02:56:40.354
LIAM: Yeah, it'll be fine. It'll be fine.

02:56:40.354 --> 02:56:42.538
MARISHA: You're going to go back to the temple.

02:56:42.538 --> 02:56:46.748
TALIESIN: That's a terrible idea. I kind of like
it. That's not a good thing. I think it's a good

02:56:46.748 --> 02:56:49.276
idea. That may not be a good thing.

02:56:49.276 --> 02:56:51.539
LIAM: Do you want to come with me?

02:56:51.539 --> 02:56:54.314
TALIESIN: Yes.

02:56:54.314 --> 02:56:56.045
LIAM: I hook him by the arm and we just start
off.

02:56:56.045 --> 02:56:57.365
TALIESIN: Find a bar!

02:56:57.365 --> 02:57:00.048
MARISHA: I'll get things packed?

02:57:00.048 --> 02:57:03.767
LAURA: It was my idea! Go fuck yourself.

02:57:03.767 --> 02:57:05.808
LIAM: Love you!

02:57:05.808 --> 02:57:08.274
MARISHA: I look at Vex.

02:57:08.274 --> 02:57:10.166
LAURA: Dresses? Oh, everything's fucking closed!

02:57:10.166 --> 02:57:11.794
MARISHA: Oh goddamnit, Pittsburgh.

02:57:11.794 --> 02:57:15.235
LAURA: Are there dress shops open? At all?

02:57:15.235 --> 02:57:17.082
MATT: Make an investigation check.

02:57:17.082 --> 02:57:18.471
LIAM: This ain't New York City.

02:57:18.471 --> 02:57:22.112
LAURA: We just want pretty dresses. Oh! Oh! Oh!

02:57:22.112 --> 02:57:24.561
MARISHA: Get it, girl. Get it, get it, girl.

02:57:24.561 --> 02:57:26.023
LAURA: 25.

02:57:26.023 --> 02:57:28.409
MATT: You do manage to find one individual who is
in the process of

02:57:28.409 --> 02:57:31.828
closing their formal attire shop.

02:57:31.828 --> 02:57:36.127
MARISHA: I toss them 20 gold. An extra 20 minutes,
please.

02:57:36.127 --> 02:57:38.180
MATT: "But of course! Come on in."

02:57:38.180 --> 02:57:39.535
MARISHA: Thank you.

02:57:39.535 --> 02:57:41.703
TRAVIS: Wow.

02:57:41.703 --> 02:57:44.696
LAURA: Ah! Everything's better!

02:57:44.696 --> 02:57:47.562
MATT: (laughs) All right.

02:57:47.562 --> 02:57:49.996
LAURA: Keyleth?

02:57:49.996 --> 02:57:51.540
MARISHA: What?

02:57:51.540 --> 02:57:55.184
LAURA: What's good for your Ashari people?
Something covered in grass, maybe?

02:57:55.184 --> 02:57:58.254
MARISHA: Mm.

02:57:58.254 --> 02:58:00.378
LAURA: Turf? Astro-turf?

02:58:00.378 --> 02:58:07.903
MARISHA: You know, it's a little esoteric for me.
A little experimental. A little Gaga-esque.

02:58:07.903 --> 02:58:10.149
LAURA: Lots of pink bows, maybe, for me.

02:58:10.149 --> 02:58:17.134
MARISHA: You know, it reminds a little of when we
dressed Trinket up in pink bows.

02:58:17.134 --> 02:58:19.082
LAURA: Right, and we could be like--

02:58:19.082 --> 02:58:22.580
MARISHA: I don't know if that's a good thing.

02:58:22.580 --> 02:58:23.817
LAURA: Help us. Make us pretty.

02:58:23.817 --> 02:58:25.114
MARISHA: Make us pretty.

02:58:25.114 --> 02:58:26.791
LAURA: And very expensive looking.

02:58:26.791 --> 02:58:30.094
MARISHA: I'm going to become royalty. Kind of, but
not really.

02:58:30.094 --> 02:58:32.499
LAURA: It's my first time getting to dress up as
royalty.

02:58:32.499 --> 02:58:33.599
MARISHA: Yes!

02:58:33.599 --> 02:58:41.248
MATT: "All right. That-- Okay." The gentleman
seems a bit overwhelmed, but quickly goes ahead

02:58:41.248 --> 02:58:47.224
and helps you guys find, over the next 30 or so
minutes, some very nice dresses. Better than

02:58:47.224 --> 02:58:52.618
anything you've previously worn. And he gets you
something that he thinks royalty should wear. As

02:58:52.618 --> 02:59:00.590
there is no real royalty in Vasselheim, it is a
church-run state. It is more of a frumpy robe with

02:59:00.590 --> 02:59:02.529
a fur collar.

02:59:02.529 --> 02:59:04.771
MARISHA: Vex, this collar is so big.

02:59:04.771 --> 02:59:06.802
LAURA: This is terrible. Give her something flowy.

02:59:06.802 --> 02:59:08.434
MARISHA: Why can't I see over it?

02:59:08.434 --> 02:59:16.193
MATT: "Flowy. Of course. I'm so sorry. Flowy,
yes." He's starting to get a little impatient, but

02:59:16.193 --> 02:59:23.084
does manage to pull one very nice simple gown,
that just hangs off the shoulders and pools on the

02:59:23.084 --> 02:59:24.519
ground around you.

02:59:24.519 --> 02:59:26.291
LAURA: In all the colors. Can it be in all the
colors?

02:59:26.291 --> 02:59:29.078
MARISHA: Yeah, can we dip-dye it blue?

02:59:29.078 --> 02:59:33.173
MATT: "Dye? I could have it dyed. That would be by
tomorrow morning prepared."

02:59:33.173 --> 02:59:34.355
LAURA: Okay.

02:59:34.355 --> 02:59:35.592
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:59:35.592 --> 02:59:37.317
MATT: "All right, I'll get it taken care of."

02:59:37.317 --> 02:59:38.775
MARISHA: Okay.

02:59:38.775 --> 02:59:42.168
MATT: All right. While that's happening, you two
are heading to the Raven's Crest?

02:59:42.168 --> 02:59:43.170
LIAM: Yeah.

02:59:43.170 --> 02:59:52.334
MATT: All right. So you guys walk over to the Dusk
Meadow. You're met by the same gray, slightly

02:59:52.334 --> 02:59:57.560
bleak atmosphere on this side of Vasselheim. But
you make your way to the exterior of the large

02:59:57.560 --> 03:00:06.820
structure. The ominous obsidian and gold building
that represents the center, if you will, the

03:00:06.820 --> 03:00:14.120
beating heart of the Raven Queen's worship. As you
approach the front stairway, both of you familiar

03:00:14.120 --> 03:00:24.540
with, one brought in, the other not met with any
living person for the most part in your journey,

03:00:24.598 --> 03:00:28.547
you both approach-- still arms hooked?

03:00:28.547 --> 03:00:29.513
LIAM: No.

03:00:29.513 --> 03:00:31.008
MATT: Okay.

03:00:31.008 --> 03:00:33.571
LIAM: I suspect you've been here before.

03:00:33.571 --> 03:00:35.296
TALIESIN: Yes.

03:00:43.816 --> 03:00:54.274
LIAM: (sighs) I like that things are better
between you and I now.

03:00:54.345 --> 03:01:02.189
TALIESIN: I feel the same. I like that most things
are better now. Not everything, but it's a

03:01:02.189 --> 03:01:05.178
brighter world, even for us.

03:01:05.178 --> 03:01:14.351
LIAM: Do you know what I like? I like the version
of you that my sister brings out.

03:01:14.351 --> 03:01:29.100
TALIESIN: I do too. I'll do my best to keep him in
the forefront. And as for you: I like the version

03:01:29.100 --> 03:01:40.544
of you that's not afraid. So let's go meet this
terrible thing, drop off the book, get you feeling

03:01:40.544 --> 03:01:42.809
a bit better.

03:01:42.809 --> 03:01:45.258
LIAM: (clears throat) Come on.

03:01:45.258 --> 03:01:48.036
TALIESIN: Fuck. (clears throat)

03:01:48.036 --> 03:01:55.341
MATT: As you both ascend the stairs, you see
standing-- previously not noticed as you guys were

03:01:55.341 --> 03:02:01.088
having a conversation-- but off to the sides of
each side of the entryway, the two doors that are

03:02:01.088 --> 03:02:07.599
closed, there are two women in long black gowns
with dark veils that drift over their head to the

03:02:07.599 --> 03:02:14.419
mid torso, that you had lead you into the chamber
initially. Both suddenly present themselves, bow,

03:02:14.419 --> 03:02:20.887
and step out of the side as the chamber doors open
to the interior of the Raven's Crest temple.

03:02:20.887 --> 03:02:28.439
There, standing as the doors open, is what looks
to be an older woman wearing the same attire, the

03:02:28.439 --> 03:02:35.126
same dark veil, somewhat able to see her features
beneath the dark material that hangs in front of

03:02:35.126 --> 03:02:39.175
her. She steps forward as the doors open.

03:02:40.764 --> 03:03:00.832
LIAM: Hello there. You recognize me. This is my
friend. We bring you an offering for the Queen.

03:03:04.023 --> 03:03:09.022
MATT: The woman bends down, takes the tome from
your hand. She holds it, she takes her fingers and

03:03:09.022 --> 03:03:17.279
brushes the cloth away that currently obscures the
tome, takes a look at it, holds it a foot further

03:03:17.279 --> 03:03:24.928
away from her face, and throws the cloth over the
front, clasps it in her arms and brings it down

03:03:25.142 --> 03:03:30.183
towards her torso. And, for the first time since
this-- you've heard her speak before, you have

03:03:30.183 --> 03:03:35.387
done this before-- but the strange eerie kind of
airy whisper comes out from this older woman as

03:03:35.387 --> 03:03:47.734
she bends forward, clutching this tome. "We thank
you. And we will be sure that this finds its final seal."

03:03:54.506 --> 03:04:10.429
LIAM: She has begun to speak to me. Her desires
are not clear, entirely, but I am listening. And I

03:04:10.429 --> 03:04:13.218
intend to learn.

03:04:14.870 --> 03:04:16.940
MATT: "Good."

03:04:20.837 --> 03:04:26.449
LIAM: We have to go. But I mean to come back.

03:04:26.630 --> 03:04:34.712
MATT: "Whenever you're ready. The vision of the
gods is obscured beyond the Divine Gate. We are

03:04:34.712 --> 03:04:41.160
"not just their tools but their extensions. The
creations that act as their fingers in this plane.

03:04:41.212 --> 03:04:57.911
"The center of all other life and death. Be
watchful. Be vigilant." She bows, and backs into

03:04:57.911 --> 03:05:03.884
the Raven's Crest once more as the doors close,
the two other women now flanking out of the

03:05:03.884 --> 03:05:07.867
shadows and stepping before each door, and
seemingly just

03:05:07.867 --> 03:05:10.720
not paying attention to your presence.

03:05:12.902 --> 03:05:20.716
TALIESIN: I was envious of you once. God. So
sorry. (sighs)

03:05:20.716 --> 03:05:24.588
LIAM: (whispers) Good day.

03:05:24.588 --> 03:05:26.173
MATT: They make no response as you guys turn and
make your way

03:05:26.173 --> 03:05:28.933
down the stairs from the Raven's Crest.

03:05:32.949 --> 03:05:41.592
TALIESIN: Just so you know, it is your duty to
have some joy in the meantime. You do know that,

03:05:41.592 --> 03:05:55.301
right? You're no use to her a wreck. She needs a
man. Have a fucking beer. And I slap him on the

03:05:55.301 --> 03:05:58.945
ass as we walk towards the pub.

03:05:58.945 --> 03:06:08.976
LIAM: Look over my shoulder at the temple as we
walk. Come on, let's get drunk.

03:06:09.874 --> 03:06:14.913
MATT: As your head moves forward, walking, you feel
this cold tingle just drift down the back of your

03:06:14.968 --> 03:06:25.814
neck and spine, then it fades, and you keep
walking, carrying on your chest there a brief,

03:06:25.814 --> 03:06:41.905
warm secondary heartbeat representing the brief
boon granted upon you by the Raven Queen. You

03:06:41.905 --> 03:06:45.251
catch up with the ladies at the bar.

03:06:47.096 --> 03:06:48.475
MARISHA: Hey!

03:06:48.475 --> 03:06:50.777
LAURA and SAM: (laugh)

03:06:50.777 --> 03:06:54.210
TALIESIN: I shove Keyleth at him. Fix that, good
god.

03:06:54.210 --> 03:06:55.606
LIAM: (laughs)

03:06:55.606 --> 03:06:56.968
TALIESIN: Ahh.

03:06:56.968 --> 03:06:58.069
LIAM: Scoop and lift.

03:06:58.069 --> 03:06:59.054
MARISHA: Are you broken again?

03:06:59.054 --> 03:06:59.793
LIAM: No.

03:06:59.793 --> 03:07:00.351
MARISHA: Ah.

03:07:00.351 --> 03:07:01.603
LIAM: I need a drink, have you had one already?

03:07:01.603 --> 03:07:02.369
MARISHA: Yes.

03:07:02.369 --> 03:07:03.014
LIAM: I'm fine.

03:07:03.014 --> 03:07:03.915
LAURA: She's had a few.

03:07:03.915 --> 03:07:04.741
LIAM: Yeah?

03:07:04.741 --> 03:07:06.947
LAURA and MATT: (laugh)

03:07:06.947 --> 03:07:13.951
MATT: You guys, you've found dresses that are to
your liking. You've-- the cost of them with the

03:07:13.951 --> 03:07:17.895
materials would probably run about 20 gold
apiece.

03:07:17.895 --> 03:07:19.709
LAURA: I think that's acceptable.

03:07:19.709 --> 03:07:20.908
SAM: (laughs)

03:07:20.908 --> 03:07:22.248
MARISHA: Designer.

03:07:22.248 --> 03:07:23.585
LAURA: Mm-hm.

03:07:23.585 --> 03:07:24.369
TALIESIN: Couture.

03:07:24.369 --> 03:07:25.038
MARISHA: Couture.

03:07:25.038 --> 03:07:27.145
LAURA: I can't believe these dresses are so much
cheaper than a healing potion.

03:07:27.145 --> 03:07:28.075
MARISHA: I know.

03:07:28.075 --> 03:07:28.806
LAURA: Ridiculous.

03:07:28.806 --> 03:07:31.022
MARISHA: It's like, look at the beading!

03:07:31.022 --> 03:07:32.082
LAURA: (laughs)

03:07:32.082 --> 03:07:33.344
MARISHA: It's crazy!

03:07:33.344 --> 03:07:36.922
LAURA: Wait, we're picking them up in the morning,
Keyleth. You're not even wearing it yet.

03:07:36.922 --> 03:07:38.514
MARISHA: In the morning, I'll look at the
beading.

03:07:38.514 --> 03:07:40.317
(all laugh)

03:07:40.317 --> 03:07:41.691
KEYLETH: It's crazy.

03:07:41.691 --> 03:07:42.966
TALIESIN: That's sweat, yes.

03:07:42.966 --> 03:07:43.666
KEYLETH: Yeah.

03:07:43.666 --> 03:07:44.751
TALIESIN: Yeah.

03:07:44.751 --> 03:07:48.064
Ah, where are Grog and Taryon?

03:07:48.137 --> 03:07:50.144
LAURA: Oh, we haven't heard from them in a long
time.

03:07:50.144 --> 03:07:51.431
TALIESIN: Grog, Taryon!

03:07:51.431 --> 03:07:52.245
LAURA: Grog!

03:07:52.245 --> 03:07:53.344
TRAVIS: Can we hear them?

03:07:53.344 --> 03:07:57.214
MATT: You were still in the Quad Roads, keeping
low. You guys are both-- you're able to hear them.

03:07:57.214 --> 03:08:01.979
Whatever you guys have been up to trying to stay
out of sight.

03:08:01.979 --> 03:08:03.654
TRAVIS: Yes?

03:08:03.654 --> 03:08:05.862
TALIESIN: We're at a bar, where are you?

03:08:05.862 --> 03:08:10.865
TRAVIS: Funny, we are doing something similar. Are
you done?

03:08:10.865 --> 03:08:14.302
TALIESIN: No, we're just starting. You--

03:08:14.302 --> 03:08:16.054
SAM: Are they talking to you right now?

03:08:16.054 --> 03:08:16.788
TRAVIS: Yeah, they are.

03:08:16.788 --> 03:08:17.609
TALIESIN: Is that Taryon?

03:08:17.609 --> 03:08:18.788
SAM: Just tell them to--

03:08:18.788 --> 03:08:19.926
TALIESIN: Tell him we say hello.

03:08:19.926 --> 03:08:22.178
TRAVIS: All right. The two fucking people talking
to--

03:08:22.178 --> 03:08:22.972
SAM: Tell them--

03:08:22.972 --> 03:08:23.819
TRAVIS: Yep.

03:08:23.819 --> 03:08:25.144
LAURA: Did you buy potions?

03:08:25.144 --> 03:08:25.986
SAM: Can we ask them where they are?

03:08:25.986 --> 03:08:26.760
TALIESIN: I need to talk to Taryon.

03:08:26.760 --> 03:08:27.391
TRAVIS: Yeah.

03:08:27.391 --> 03:08:28.377
SAM: Ask them where they are.

03:08:28.377 --> 03:08:30.049
TALIESIN: Tell Taryon to take you where we all are
right now

03:08:30.049 --> 03:08:31.849
SAM: Tell them where we are right now, and ask
them where they are.

03:08:31.849 --> 03:08:34.373
TALIESIN: Just have him bring us to us-- I'll give
you directions. It'll be fine.

03:08:34.373 --> 03:08:35.497
SAM: Tell them--

03:08:35.497 --> 03:08:37.956
TRAVIS: My real-world ADD is fully maxed out.

03:08:37.956 --> 03:08:40.123
(all laugh)

03:08:40.123 --> 03:08:46.422
TRAVIS: I just heard a bunch of sea lions barking
like, "Ar ar ar ar." It was nothing. Oh fuck.

03:08:46.422 --> 03:08:48.664
TALIESIN: Why don't you two come join us?

03:08:48.664 --> 03:08:52.234
TRAVIS: I reach over, I cover Tary's mouth.
Percy?

03:08:52.234 --> 03:08:53.253
TALIESIN: Yes?

03:08:53.253 --> 03:08:55.498
TRAVIS: Let me know when you're done.

03:08:55.498 --> 03:08:57.503
TALIESIN: Are you sure? We're drinking. You can
join.

03:08:57.503 --> 03:08:59.948
TRAVIS: All right. What tavern are you in?

03:08:59.948 --> 03:09:03.652
TALIESIN: All right, I'm going to send you the
psychic information of where we are right now.

03:09:03.652 --> 03:09:05.078
TRAVIS: You can do that?

03:09:05.078 --> 03:09:06.556
LAURA: I want to say the name of it.

03:09:06.556 --> 03:09:08.367
MARISHA and MATT: (laugh)

03:09:08.367 --> 03:09:14.448
MATT: Okay. Vex lets you know that this is the--
shit, what is it? What tavern would this be here?

03:09:14.448 --> 03:09:16.237
Let me go through.

03:09:16.237 --> 03:09:18.586
TALIESIN: Can't you just bullshit? You have to
actually look up the real name?

03:09:18.586 --> 03:09:20.082
SAM: No, there's two bars in Vasselheim!

03:09:20.082 --> 03:09:21.618
MATT: There are a lot of bars in Vasselheim.

03:09:21.618 --> 03:09:25.633
TALIESIN: Yeah. It's-- the other bar would
actually be enough.

03:09:25.633 --> 03:09:26.593
LAURA: The other bar.

03:09:26.593 --> 03:09:27.980
MATT: The Siren's Succor.

03:09:27.980 --> 03:09:29.730
LAURA: (mystical voice) We're in the Siren's
Succor.

03:09:29.730 --> 03:09:31.228
TRAVIS: Oh my god, I heard it.

03:09:31.228 --> 03:09:32.231
TALIESIN: Isn't that amazing?

03:09:32.231 --> 03:09:33.546
TRAVIS: My powers are getting stronger.

03:09:33.546 --> 03:09:35.491
TALIESIN: I've gone beyond the veil.

03:09:35.491 --> 03:09:37.367
TRAVIS: All right. We'll make our way over to
you.

03:09:37.367 --> 03:09:38.457
TALIESIN: I've gained such power.

03:09:38.457 --> 03:09:40.523
LAURA: (mystical voice) Meet us soon. Did you buy
potions?

03:09:40.523 --> 03:09:42.142
TRAVIS: Are you asking me to buy potions, Percy?

03:09:42.142 --> 03:09:44.815
TALIESIN: No, I want you to come straight to the
bar. Straight to the bar.

03:09:44.815 --> 03:09:46.579
TRAVIS: But I thought you just sent me a request
for--

03:09:46.579 --> 03:09:49.644
TALIESIN: I was thinking about something else. No,
you just heard me thinking about something else.

03:09:49.701 --> 03:09:51.705
TRAVIS: All right, we'll have to fine-tune my
abilities.

03:09:51.705 --> 03:09:52.346
TALIESIN: You'll get there.

03:09:52.346 --> 03:09:53.198
TRAVIS: All right.

03:09:53.198 --> 03:09:54.367
TALIESIN: I have every faith.

03:09:54.367 --> 03:09:56.674
MARISHA: You're doing really well at perfecting
your mystical voice.

03:09:56.674 --> 03:09:59.177
TRAVIS: Oh my god, I hear two voices.

03:09:59.177 --> 03:10:00.835
MARISHA: Yeah, it's good. It's good. I like it.

03:10:00.835 --> 03:10:06.112
LIAM: Freddie. Order me something that rich people
drink.

03:10:08.063 --> 03:10:10.088
LAURA: Beer! (laughs)

03:10:10.088 --> 03:10:10.906
TALIESIN: Get him--

03:10:10.906 --> 03:10:12.044
LAURA: Some wine.

03:10:12.044 --> 03:10:14.305
LIAM: Is that it? I've done beer.

03:10:14.305 --> 03:10:20.501
TALIESIN: Get him a giant glass of half Guinness,
half whatever cider they have.

03:10:20.501 --> 03:10:21.483
LAURA: Ugh.

03:10:21.483 --> 03:10:24.852
TALIESIN: Rich people get drunk. Oh, do you want
something fancy?

03:10:24.852 --> 03:10:25.708
LIAM: Yeah!

03:10:25.708 --> 03:10:27.182
TALIESIN: Okay, I take the black and tan.

03:10:27.182 --> 03:10:28.848
MATT: (laughs)

03:10:28.848 --> 03:10:30.057
MARISHA: Oh, black and tan.

03:10:30.057 --> 03:10:32.744
TALIESIN: And I get him a tiny glass of creme de
menthe. (laughs)

03:10:32.744 --> 03:10:37.966
LIAM: This one tells me that you have the goods,
so I want the goods. Want the goods.

03:10:37.966 --> 03:10:40.496
TALIESIN: I don't know how to feel a little
awkward in saying I'm not sure I want to waste it

03:10:40.496 --> 03:10:42.365
on you. But--

03:10:42.365 --> 03:10:45.030
LIAM: We're in a bar, you fucker. Buy me a drink,
you asshole.

03:10:45.030 --> 03:10:47.164
I've saved your life like three times.

03:10:47.164 --> 03:10:50.108
TALIESIN: I wait for her to nod. Okay, that's
enough.

03:10:50.108 --> 03:10:52.472
MARISHA: What do you mean by the goods?

03:10:52.472 --> 03:10:57.582
TALIESIN: Oh dear. I pull up-- I tip the barman
because I'm showing him that I'm pulling something

03:10:57.582 --> 03:11:00.038
out for some glassware.

03:11:00.038 --> 03:11:00.952
MATT: Okay.

03:11:00.952 --> 03:11:02.626
TALIESIN: Because I'm not an asshole.

03:11:02.626 --> 03:11:03.311
MATT: Right.

03:11:03.311 --> 03:11:04.187
TALIESIN: Well--

03:11:04.187 --> 03:11:05.756
SAM: (incredulous sound)

03:11:05.756 --> 03:11:07.160
(all laugh)

03:11:07.160 --> 03:11:10.077
TALIESIN: And then I pour a little bit of the Tear
Whiskey. Of the Green Tear.

03:11:10.077 --> 03:11:11.963
LIAM: Mm.

03:11:11.963 --> 03:11:14.266
TALIESIN: It's mean. It's minty. You'll love it.

03:11:14.266 --> 03:11:15.086
LIAM: Hm.

03:11:15.086 --> 03:11:16.423
TALIESIN: We have it every year.

03:11:16.423 --> 03:11:18.235
MARISHA: Where did you keep that?

03:11:18.235 --> 03:11:19.347
LAURA: (laughs)

03:11:19.347 --> 03:11:20.580
MARISHA: Where'd you just pull that from?

03:11:20.580 --> 03:11:25.084
TALIESIN: Okay, do you actually want me to answer?
You can say yes, it's all right. It's not going to

03:11:25.084 --> 03:11:27.239
get weird. That's all right. I'm going to tell you
anyway.

03:11:27.239 --> 03:11:28.381
MARISHA: Whoa. Jeez.

03:11:28.381 --> 03:11:29.827
TALIESIN: See this belt? It's got a series of
these little--

03:11:29.827 --> 03:11:31.067
MARISHA: Uh-huh.

03:11:31.067 --> 03:11:34.651
TALIESIN: -- things on. Those are mostly filled
with little bits of gunpowder I have wrapped up in

03:11:34.651 --> 03:11:35.861
the thing.

03:11:35.861 --> 03:11:36.670
LIAM: That's all?

03:11:36.670 --> 03:11:37.673
MARISHA: Right.

03:11:37.673 --> 03:11:38.808
TALIESIN: These last four are liquor.

03:11:38.808 --> 03:11:39.692
MARISHA: (gasps)

03:11:39.692 --> 03:11:40.502
TALIESIN: Sh.

03:11:40.502 --> 03:11:41.983
MARISHA: That's so smart.

03:11:41.983 --> 03:11:45.801
TALIESIN: That's how I can just stand everywhere
among their being idiots, is I'm really trashed.

03:11:45.801 --> 03:11:48.511
MARISHA: Wow. And probably much cheaper than just
buying in bars all the time.

03:11:48.511 --> 03:11:51.148
TALIESIN: Yeah. Oh yeah. No, I'm-- well. I like
to--

03:11:51.148 --> 03:11:52.659
MARISHA: Wow.

03:11:52.743 --> 03:11:54.177
TALIESIN: -- drink what we-- the locals.

03:11:54.177 --> 03:11:55.436
LAURA: I'm staring at the door waiting for Grog
and Taryon.

03:11:55.436 --> 03:11:56.743
MATT: You have to take the pre-gaming feat to
actually use that ability.

03:11:56.743 --> 03:11:58.071
TALIESIN: What? Oh--

03:11:58.071 --> 03:12:04.807
MATT: (laughs) At that point, you watch as Grog's
hands hit the doorway and he sheepishly looks in,

03:12:04.807 --> 03:12:08.491
checking the surroundings for any possible--

03:12:08.491 --> 03:12:09.484
LAURA: Grog.

03:12:09.484 --> 03:12:10.928
TRAVIS: How busy is it in the tavern?

03:12:10.928 --> 03:12:14.250
MATT: It's actually pretty sparse, aside from your
friends, maybe two other individuals.

03:12:14.250 --> 03:12:16.045
TRAVIS: Okay. Come in. Come inside. Listen.

03:12:16.045 --> 03:12:20.669
MATT: Okay. Tary comes in and (crashing sound)
behind you. Doty.

03:12:20.669 --> 03:12:22.265
TRAVIS: No, sh. Gah. Sh.

03:12:22.265 --> 03:12:23.255
MARISHA: Hey! Oh, sorry.

03:12:23.255 --> 03:12:24.402
LAURA: I forgot how weird Doty looks.

03:12:24.402 --> 03:12:26.040
TRAVIS: Sh. Jeez. Just bring it down a notch.

03:12:26.040 --> 03:12:27.138
TALIESIN: This is so-- Oh. Hm.

03:12:27.138 --> 03:12:32.130
TRAVIS: Apparently, Dotty had a bit of a run-in
with some of that Vasselheim--

03:12:32.182 --> 03:12:33.846
LAURA: Did you get it? Did you finally get it?

03:12:33.846 --> 03:12:34.872
MARISHA: (laughs)

03:12:34.872 --> 03:12:36.196
SAM: Did you get it?

03:12:36.196 --> 03:12:37.099
TRAVIS: Yeah.

03:12:37.099 --> 03:12:38.245
(all laugh)

03:12:38.245 --> 03:12:39.626
TALIESIN: For those of you at home, this thing has
been just driving us nuts.

03:12:39.626 --> 03:12:40.609
LAURA: It's been all night.

03:12:40.609 --> 03:12:41.874
LIAM: It's a stirge.

03:12:41.874 --> 03:12:42.848
TRAVIS: We had a bit of a run-in--

03:12:42.848 --> 03:12:43.380
MATT: It's fine.

03:12:43.380 --> 03:12:49.130
TRAVIS: -- and Doty may or may not have
paddy-caked some of the guards, so, like, we need

03:12:49.130 --> 03:12:50.156
to remove--

03:12:50.156 --> 03:12:52.839
SAM: (tearfully) Doty killed two guards. He just
killed them. They're dead.

03:12:52.839 --> 03:12:53.866
TRAVIS: Well, there it is.

03:12:53.866 --> 03:12:54.831
SAM: (tearfully) They're dead!

03:12:54.831 --> 03:12:55.479
TRAVIS: Yeah.

03:12:55.479 --> 03:12:56.352
SAM: (tearfully) He killed two guards.

03:12:56.352 --> 03:12:57.062
LAURA: He killed them?

03:12:57.062 --> 03:12:57.745
TRAVIS: He's been like this.

03:12:57.745 --> 03:12:58.714
SAM: (tearfully) We didn't tell him to! He just
did.

03:12:58.714 --> 03:12:59.621
LAURA: Did he really kill them?

03:12:59.621 --> 03:13:01.273
LIAM: But did the disguise work?

03:13:01.273 --> 03:13:04.117
SAM: I actually think it did. Actually.

03:13:04.117 --> 03:13:06.222
TRAVIS: He's been doing this for about
half an hour, so--

03:13:06.222 --> 03:13:08.043
TALIESIN: Half full. He'll have a glass of
something half full. Thank--

03:13:08.220 --> 03:13:11.588
MARISHA: What? What did you tell Doty? What did
you inform him right before--

03:13:11.588 --> 03:13:13.018
LIAM: Are you sure they were dead? Are they just
fucked up?

03:13:13.018 --> 03:13:13.764
TRAVIS: I think they were--

03:13:13.764 --> 03:13:14.719
MATT: Doty is writing all this down by the way.

03:13:14.719 --> 03:13:16.121
MARISHA: Potentially murdered the-- Doty!

03:13:16.121 --> 03:13:17.427
SAM: This is evidence, Doty!

03:13:17.427 --> 03:13:19.375
MARISHA: I might-- Oh.

03:13:19.375 --> 03:13:21.076
TRAVIS: Look, Percy. Vax.

03:13:21.076 --> 03:13:21.775
SAM: Ugh.

03:13:21.775 --> 03:13:22.728
LAURA: Dear diary.

03:13:22.728 --> 03:13:23.579
TRAVIS: I think you you need to remove--

03:13:23.579 --> 03:13:25.526
LAURA: I have an itty bitty metal penis.

03:13:25.526 --> 03:13:27.831
(all laugh)

03:13:27.831 --> 03:13:29.089
TRAVIS: You need to remove--

03:13:29.089 --> 03:13:30.453
TALIESIN: Leave that there.

03:13:30.453 --> 03:13:31.903
TRAVIS: -- Doty's disguise.

03:13:31.903 --> 03:13:32.766
TALIESIN: No.

03:13:32.766 --> 03:13:35.627
SAM: No, no! Oh, because they might recognize him
as the murderer?

03:13:35.627 --> 03:13:37.079
TRAVIS: Yeah. They'll be looking for a giant
red-haired--

03:13:37.079 --> 03:13:37.877
TALIESIN: Wait.

03:13:37.877 --> 03:13:38.897
TRAVIS: -- eight-foot-tall--

03:13:38.897 --> 03:13:41.929
SAM: No. What we need to do is put another
disguise on top of this one.

03:13:41.929 --> 03:13:44.089
(all laugh)

03:13:44.089 --> 03:13:45.023
TRAVIS: You're right.

03:13:45.023 --> 03:13:51.226
TALIESIN: Doty. Doty. Did you actually expire two
soldiers?

03:13:52.698 --> 03:13:57.213
LAURA: As he's doing this, I pull out some
lipstick and I start drawing lipstick on his face,

03:13:57.213 --> 03:13:59.549
to try to turn him boy to girl.

03:13:59.549 --> 03:14:00.792
MATT: Doesn't resist.

03:14:00.792 --> 03:14:02.271
TALIESIN: You ask and he listens to you.

03:14:02.271 --> 03:14:03.694
LIAM: Is there a mop anywhere in the room?

03:14:03.694 --> 03:14:04.365
MARISHA: What?

03:14:04.365 --> 03:14:05.430
LIAM: In this room?

03:14:05.430 --> 03:14:06.838
MATT: Not within visual--

03:14:06.838 --> 03:14:07.698
LIAM: No.

03:14:07.698 --> 03:14:09.520
MARISHA: You want me to ask Doty? Or you want me
to ask Tary?

03:14:09.520 --> 03:14:10.546
MATT: -- vicinity. You could ask.

03:14:10.546 --> 03:14:11.575
LIAM: What about drapes on the windows?

03:14:11.575 --> 03:14:13.530
SAM: He won't answer any of you.

03:14:13.600 --> 03:14:14.683
TALIESIN: Ask him if he actually just hurt, or if
they're--

03:14:14.683 --> 03:14:15.512
MATT: Not in this tavern, no.

03:14:15.512 --> 03:14:16.421
MARISHA: -- just unconscious.

03:14:16.421 --> 03:14:17.581
TALIESIN: Maybe he just punched them a couple
times.

03:14:17.581 --> 03:14:18.384
SAM: Greg knows.

03:14:18.384 --> 03:14:19.329
TRAVIS: Yep.

03:14:19.329 --> 03:14:20.554
TALIESIN: Ah, that's close enough.

03:14:20.554 --> 03:14:23.668
SAM: Did you kill them, with those punches of
fury?

03:14:23.668 --> 03:14:24.721
TALIESIN: Did you?

03:14:24.721 --> 03:14:25.724
TRAVIS: I did.

03:14:25.724 --> 03:14:27.338
MARISHA: Are you sure? Did you check?

03:14:27.338 --> 03:14:28.998
TRAVIS: I don't know. I'm really strong these
days.

03:14:28.998 --> 03:14:30.142
MARISHA: Grog.

03:14:30.142 --> 03:14:31.388
LIAM: Insight check Grog.

03:14:31.388 --> 03:14:33.705
TALIESIN: I'm joining in on this insight check. I
call bullshit.

03:14:33.705 --> 03:14:36.965
MATT: (laughs) Sure.

03:14:36.965 --> 03:14:37.955
LIAM: Well, that's a one.

03:14:37.955 --> 03:14:38.946
LAURA: (laughs)

03:14:38.946 --> 03:14:39.997
LIAM: I'm not wasting Luck on it.

03:14:39.997 --> 03:14:41.826
MATT: He fucking killed two people.

03:14:41.826 --> 03:14:42.498
TALIESIN: 13.

03:14:42.498 --> 03:14:43.533
LIAM: Jeez, man.

03:14:43.533 --> 03:14:44.248
LAURA: Grog.

03:14:44.248 --> 03:14:45.235
TRAVIS: It was like an act of mercy, really.

03:14:45.235 --> 03:14:46.010
LIAM: Did they attack you?

03:14:46.010 --> 03:14:47.084
MATT: Grog, make a deception check.

03:14:47.084 --> 03:14:47.975
TRAVIS: No, no.

03:14:47.975 --> 03:14:49.452
SAM: Oh, boy.

03:14:49.452 --> 03:14:50.943
LAURA: (nervous sound)

03:14:50.943 --> 03:14:51.838
TRAVIS: 19.

03:14:51.838 --> 03:14:52.631
(all laugh)

03:14:52.631 --> 03:14:53.420
TALIESIN: Fuck.

03:14:53.420 --> 03:14:54.681
MATT: Grog fucking killed two people!

03:14:54.681 --> 03:14:55.392
TRAVIS: 20.

03:14:55.392 --> 03:14:56.301
LAURA: What? 20!

03:14:56.301 --> 03:14:57.312
LIAM: Why? Were you in danger?

03:14:57.312 --> 03:14:59.029
LAURA: This is what happens when Pike isn't
around!

03:14:59.029 --> 03:14:59.949
TRAVIS: No no.

03:14:59.949 --> 03:15:00.602
LIAM: Why?

03:15:00.602 --> 03:15:03.939
TRAVIS: Look, from what I understand, these guards
were attracted to the horrific disguise that Doty

03:15:03.939 --> 03:15:09.404
had. He knocked them out, brought them in. I
checked for, like, a pulse, checked their knee

03:15:09.404 --> 03:15:12.415
reflexes, and they were on death's door, so I just
finished the deal.

03:15:12.415 --> 03:15:13.138
MARISHA: Okay--

03:15:13.138 --> 03:15:14.071
TRAVIS: It was really merciful.

03:15:14.071 --> 03:15:14.873
MARISHA: That doesn't--

03:15:14.873 --> 03:15:16.209
TALIESIN: I'm feeling slightly better but slightly
worse?

03:15:16.209 --> 03:15:17.138
LIAM: What a clusterfuck.

03:15:17.138 --> 03:15:18.910
LAURA: Did anyone see you do it?

03:15:18.910 --> 03:15:22.706
SAM: We're not sure, Doty did this outside without
us being--

03:15:22.706 --> 03:15:25.370
LAURA: Doty, did anyone see you do that to the
guards?

03:15:25.370 --> 03:15:30.256
SAM: He won't answer you. Doty, did anyone witness
your crime?

03:15:30.256 --> 03:15:33.886
MATT: (squeaking "I don't know" sound)

03:15:33.886 --> 03:15:39.662
MARISHA: Tary, what do you mean you didn't tell
him to-- he just did this on --

03:15:39.662 --> 03:15:44.223
SAM: I told him to protect us! He's my protector.
He does what needs to be done to protect me.

03:15:44.223 --> 03:15:47.906
MARISHA: (sighs) Tary, is this thing safe to be
following us around?

03:15:47.906 --> 03:15:50.540
TRAVIS: Yeah, no, he's really impressive actually.
Have a little more respect.

03:15:50.540 --> 03:15:53.128
LAURA: Maybe you shouldn't bring him into cities.
Maybe that should just be a rule.

03:15:53.128 --> 03:15:54.181
LIAM: Was there no other choice?

03:15:54.181 --> 03:15:55.367
LAURA: Doty doesn't come into cities.

03:15:55.367 --> 03:15:56.261
TRAVIS: Well, I don't know, we weren't--

03:15:56.261 --> 03:15:57.703
TALIESIN: We let the bear come into bars.

03:15:57.703 --> 03:15:59.296
LAURA: Well, yeah, Trinket is well-behaved.

03:15:59.296 --> 03:16:00.733
TALIESIN: That's fair.

03:16:00.733 --> 03:16:02.132
LAURA: Doty kills people.

03:16:02.132 --> 03:16:05.669
SAM: Well, to be fair, Greg killed the people.

03:16:05.669 --> 03:16:06.788
TRAVIS: Yeah.

03:16:06.788 --> 03:16:08.636
SAM: Doty merely roughed them up.

03:16:08.636 --> 03:16:17.876
TRAVIS: And to be even more fair, they'd been
drinking all day. Smelled like alcohol.

03:16:17.927 --> 03:16:20.274
(all laugh)

03:16:20.274 --> 03:16:21.377
MATT: And he does.

03:16:21.377 --> 03:16:22.351
TALIESIN: Are we still buying this?

03:16:22.351 --> 03:16:23.498
MARISHA: No way we'd buy that delivery!

03:16:23.498 --> 03:16:24.456
MATT: (laughs)

03:16:24.456 --> 03:16:26.308
TRAVIS: You bet your ass you do, that's a 20!

03:16:26.360 --> 03:16:27.489
MARISHA: Can I roll an insight check? That's
bullshit!

03:16:27.489 --> 03:16:28.280
TRAVIS: That's a 20!

03:16:28.280 --> 03:16:29.086
MATT: You can.

03:16:29.086 --> 03:16:30.212
MARISHA: There's no fucking way!

03:16:30.212 --> 03:16:31.102
MATT: You can, go ahead and make an insight
check.

03:16:31.102 --> 03:16:32.376
MARISHA: What? Oh, bullshit. That was the most
bullshit delivery.

03:16:32.376 --> 03:16:33.366
LAURA: Yeah, can I try? Can I try too?

03:16:33.366 --> 03:16:34.578
TRAVIS: I'm never gonna roll that high again.

03:16:34.578 --> 03:16:35.433
LIAM: Please, save us from this moral dilemma!

03:16:35.433 --> 03:16:36.692
MARISHA: Mm, mm, 21!

03:16:36.692 --> 03:16:37.372
LAURA: Oh!

03:16:37.372 --> 03:16:40.887
MATT: You are the first person not to believe
Grog's story.

03:16:41.415 --> 03:16:42.495
MARISHA: (quietly) Grog.

03:16:42.495 --> 03:16:43.331
LAURA: (laughs)

03:16:43.331 --> 03:16:44.300
TRAVIS: Yeah.

03:16:44.300 --> 03:16:47.606
MARISHA: Do we need to make sure you're with an
adult from here on out? Can you not be trusted

03:16:47.606 --> 03:16:49.244
alone with Tary?

03:16:49.244 --> 03:16:50.761
LAURA: Did you buy potions?

03:16:50.761 --> 03:16:53.784
SAM: I have quite a gift for you!

03:16:53.784 --> 03:16:54.729
LAURA: For me?

03:16:54.729 --> 03:16:55.434
MATT: It looks like a--

03:16:55.434 --> 03:16:56.267
SAM: For all of you.

03:16:56.267 --> 03:16:57.116
LAURA: Oh.

03:16:57.116 --> 03:17:02.620
MARISHA: No, no! Do not! Do not be influenced by
his very generous act of kindness! That was so

03:17:02.620 --> 03:17:03.905
kind of you!

03:17:03.905 --> 03:17:04.921
SAM: I think you'll find something for everyone in
there.

03:17:04.921 --> 03:17:06.320
TRAVIS: Is there a little bit of vomit on there?

03:17:06.320 --> 03:17:07.989
MATT: Like a little. Spatter. It's dried by now.

03:17:07.989 --> 03:17:10.117
MARISHA: That was like 6,000 gold worth of-- But
do not! Don't!

03:17:10.117 --> 03:17:11.485
TALIESIN: Is this blood on the-- yep--

03:17:11.485 --> 03:17:12.465
TRAVIS: No, that's vomit.

03:17:12.465 --> 03:17:13.542
TALIESIN: Oh, that's good.

03:17:13.542 --> 03:17:14.298
TRAVIS: Yup.

03:17:14.298 --> 03:17:16.117
LIAM: We are skipping past the fact that two men
are dead right now.

03:17:16.117 --> 03:17:17.252
LAURA: (sighs)

03:17:17.252 --> 03:17:19.229
LIAM: Do we need to go and find them? And try
to--

03:17:19.229 --> 03:17:21.382
LAURA: Do we need to go find these dead guys?

03:17:21.382 --> 03:17:22.164
TRAVIS: Nope.

03:17:22.164 --> 03:17:23.231
MARISHA: Are you sure they're dead?

03:17:23.231 --> 03:17:24.615
TRAVIS: I forgot where I left them.

03:17:24.615 --> 03:17:27.150
MARISHA: Grog--

03:17:27.150 --> 03:17:28.350
LIAM: This is upsetting.

03:17:28.350 --> 03:17:35.841
SAM: I know where they are, but the situation was
fluid, and it was fast-moving. And we acted on our

03:17:35.841 --> 03:17:41.152
best instincts and our best judgment, and
mistakes were made.

03:17:41.222 --> 03:17:42.436
TRAVIS: Yeah. Mm-hm.

03:17:42.436 --> 03:17:45.866
MARISHA: Tary, it sounds like all of the opposite
of that is true.

03:17:45.866 --> 03:17:47.107
SAM: When you're an adventurer--

03:17:47.107 --> 03:17:48.232
LAURA: Except for mistakes.

03:17:48.232 --> 03:17:49.522
MARISHA: Except for the mistakes part, yeah.

03:17:49.522 --> 03:17:54.203
SAM: When you're an adventurer, you have to learn
to live with a certain amount of bloodshed around

03:17:54.203 --> 03:18:04.804
you, and I think what Greg has told me today--what
he has taught me was to toughen me up. And I

03:18:04.804 --> 03:18:09.247
appreciate him for that and I appreciate the
lesson. And I appreciate you all for sending me

03:18:09.247 --> 03:18:12.341
out with him, knowing full well that that would
happen.

03:18:12.341 --> 03:18:17.938
LAURA: Don't kill people in cities! Don't kill
people!

03:18:17.938 --> 03:18:22.928
SAM: I still haven't-- I-- okay.

03:18:22.928 --> 03:18:26.132
LAURA: Don't kill people!

03:18:26.132 --> 03:18:27.753
TRAVIS: Who killed anybody?

03:18:27.753 --> 03:18:28.474
LAURA: Grog!

03:18:28.474 --> 03:18:29.302
MARISHA: Vax?

03:18:29.302 --> 03:18:30.085
LAURA: Did you--

03:18:30.085 --> 03:18:31.319
TRAVIS: What?

03:18:31.319 --> 03:18:34.012
LAURA: You didn't kill anyone, did you?

03:18:34.012 --> 03:18:36.290
LIAM: Of course he did, he looked us in the eye
and he said he killed two people! We should go

03:18:36.290 --> 03:18:37.171
find them.

03:18:37.171 --> 03:18:38.339
TRAVIS: Yep. They're dead.

03:18:38.339 --> 03:18:40.250
LAURA: I don't believe him. Can I roll an insight
check?

03:18:40.250 --> 03:18:42.592
MATT: Sure.

03:18:42.592 --> 03:18:43.568
LAURA: Oh no.

03:18:43.568 --> 03:18:44.567
TALIESIN: Whose vomit was this?

03:18:44.567 --> 03:18:45.403
LAURA: Oh no!

03:18:45.403 --> 03:18:47.646
LAURA and LIAM: (laughs)

03:18:47.646 --> 03:18:48.549
MATT: What did you roll?

03:18:48.549 --> 03:18:50.061
LAURA: I believe him!

03:18:50.061 --> 03:18:50.697
MATT: What'd you roll?

03:18:50.697 --> 03:18:53.335
LAURA: I believe him so good! 11!

03:18:53.335 --> 03:18:54.286
TALIESIN: This game is a nightmare.

03:18:54.286 --> 03:18:55.730
MATT: Grog fucking killed two people!

03:18:55.730 --> 03:18:56.578
LAURA: Oh my God! Grog!

03:18:56.578 --> 03:18:57.409
LIAM: That's it.

03:18:57.409 --> 03:19:00.444
TRAVIS: Look, I was trying to protect our new
friend here. It had to be done.

03:19:00.444 --> 03:19:02.072
LIAM: Where was this place? Where was this place?

03:19:02.072 --> 03:19:03.562
LAURA: Ugh, we're never going to be able to come
back to Vasselheim!

03:19:03.562 --> 03:19:07.446
LIAM: We have to find these two men and bring them
to a temple or something, we can't just leave them--

03:19:07.446 --> 03:19:12.468
SAM: It was a potion seller, it was a medicinal,
herbalist or something--

03:19:12.468 --> 03:19:13.273
TALIESIN: Oh no.

03:19:13.273 --> 03:19:14.330
LIAM: Can you guide me there?

03:19:14.330 --> 03:19:16.605
MARISHA: Oh, you did not go to that guy, the guy
who-- oh no.

03:19:16.605 --> 03:19:17.562
TALIESIN: Did you go to that guy?

03:19:17.562 --> 03:19:18.425
SAM: It seems to be--

03:19:18.425 --> 03:19:21.276
TRAVIS: He did say he wanted to see the twins,
especially.

03:19:21.276 --> 03:19:22.259
SAM: That is not--

03:19:22.259 --> 03:19:25.391
LIAM: Look, listen, take me to this place. You and
I will carry these men to a temple.

03:19:25.391 --> 03:19:27.874
SAM: And do what? What they did to you?

03:19:27.874 --> 03:19:30.050
LIAM: We will-- what happened to me?

03:19:30.050 --> 03:19:32.190
SAM: Well, you were revived, from death.

03:19:32.190 --> 03:19:37.252
LIAM: Well, I can't do that. And you can't do
that, so we need to take these men to a temple

03:19:37.252 --> 03:19:38.525
where somebody can help them!

03:19:38.525 --> 03:19:41.228
TRAVIS: Oh, God, look, fine, they're not dead!

03:19:41.228 --> 03:19:42.290
LAURA: I don't believe you.

03:19:42.290 --> 03:19:46.756
TRAVIS: (sighs) No, I just knocked the life out of
them, but they're not dead, right, wiretapping

03:19:46.756 --> 03:19:49.081
does not mean dead, all right?

03:19:49.081 --> 03:19:50.745
(all laugh)

03:19:50.745 --> 03:19:51.821
SAM: It was in quotations.

03:19:51.821 --> 03:19:52.747
TRAVIS: Yeah.

03:19:52.747 --> 03:19:53.970
SAM and TRAVIS: Dead.

03:19:53.970 --> 03:20:00.782
TRAVIS: Okay, look, they're fine, they might be
covered in beer, we don't really need to go back

03:20:00.782 --> 03:20:01.507
for them.

03:20:01.507 --> 03:20:02.368
MARISHA: Insight check!

03:20:02.368 --> 03:20:03.451
LAURA: Yeah, I don't believe you. You killed
them.

03:20:03.451 --> 03:20:05.253
MARISHA: Now you're the fucking boy who cried wolf
three times.

03:20:05.253 --> 03:20:06.816
MATT: Go for it. Roll insight, both you guys.

03:20:06.816 --> 03:20:08.423
MARISHA: God damn it, don't fuck me, Gil.

03:20:08.423 --> 03:20:10.218
LAURA: Oh, I rolled Gil, too!

03:20:10.218 --> 03:20:12.250
MARISHA: Oh, jeez, that wasn't great.

03:20:12.250 --> 03:20:14.089
LAURA: I got it. I got you covered.

03:20:14.089 --> 03:20:14.821
MARISHA: 15.

03:20:14.821 --> 03:20:15.697
TALIESIN: Natural 20.

03:20:15.697 --> 03:20:17.261
TRAVIS: They didn't ask you to roll, Taliesin.

03:20:17.261 --> 03:20:18.450
LAURA: 24!

03:20:18.450 --> 03:20:22.259
MATT: No, you guys get at this point that Grog's
been fucking with you.

03:20:22.259 --> 03:20:23.898
LAURA: You fucking dick!

03:20:23.898 --> 03:20:24.758
TRAVIS: Yep.

03:20:24.758 --> 03:20:26.775
(all laugh)

03:20:26.775 --> 03:20:28.830
LAURA: No, but seriously, you still attacked the
guards, right?

03:20:28.830 --> 03:20:29.518
TRAVIS: He did.

03:20:29.518 --> 03:20:30.971
LAURA: That's still really bad.

03:20:30.971 --> 03:20:32.571
TALIESIN: Whose vomit is this?

03:20:32.571 --> 03:20:35.774
LIAM: So those guys aren't dead, is what you're
saying? Those two guys are not dead?

03:20:35.774 --> 03:20:36.991
LAURA and TRAVIS: They're not dead.

03:20:36.991 --> 03:20:38.117
LIAM: All right, that's kind of funny.

03:20:38.117 --> 03:20:44.311
TALIESIN: I still feel like I would like an answer
to the mystery of the vomit.

03:20:44.561 --> 03:20:48.913
LAURA: At least Doty was in disguise. No one will
recognize him. Just take the disguise off him now.

03:20:48.913 --> 03:20:51.294
TRAVIS: That's what I said like five minutes ago.

03:20:51.294 --> 03:20:53.413
LAURA: Take the disguise off of him.

03:20:53.413 --> 03:20:56.082
MARISHA: That looks like Tary's vomit.

03:20:56.147 --> 03:20:57.180
TALIESIN: How can you tell?

03:20:57.180 --> 03:21:00.832
MARISHA: Because I saw him puke under the water
and it floated right past me. I got a great view

03:21:00.832 --> 03:21:04.152
of it. He's a nervous puker.

03:21:04.152 --> 03:21:07.114
LIAM: What is better in this town? A disgusting
mess or a robit?

03:21:07.114 --> 03:21:08.264
LAURA: A robit?

03:21:08.264 --> 03:21:10.213
LIAM: An automaton.

03:21:10.213 --> 03:21:11.218
LAURA: It's necromancy.

03:21:11.218 --> 03:21:12.238
LIAM: An ottoman.

03:21:12.238 --> 03:21:13.164
LAURA: Yes.

03:21:13.164 --> 03:21:14.738
SAM: I think I need a drink.

03:21:14.738 --> 03:21:17.709
LAURA: (gasps)

03:21:17.709 --> 03:21:19.352
SAM: What?

03:21:19.352 --> 03:21:21.825
LAURA: What?

03:21:21.825 --> 03:21:24.851
TALIESIN: I pour him a little bit of the Tear
Whiskey.

03:21:24.851 --> 03:21:27.109
TRAVIS: How did you guys do?

03:21:27.109 --> 03:21:28.683
LIAM: Oh, great.

03:21:28.683 --> 03:21:30.154
LAURA: We thought we had a book.

03:21:30.154 --> 03:21:31.242
TRAVIS: But you don't?

03:21:31.410 --> 03:21:32.462
LAURA: But we didn't.

03:21:32.631 --> 03:21:35.747
LIAM: We left without the book, thinking we had
the book, and then we lied about not having the

03:21:35.747 --> 03:21:38.300
book, but we actually didn't have it.

03:21:38.300 --> 03:21:41.636
MARISHA: But it seems like it might be okay,
right?

03:21:41.636 --> 03:21:42.820
TRAVIS: Got that motherfucker.

03:21:42.820 --> 03:21:43.614
LAURA: Did you?

03:21:43.614 --> 03:21:49.315
MARISHA: Did you get it? Yeah! Real-life hero.

03:21:49.315 --> 03:21:52.667
MATT: Two guards alive. That is fucking dead

03:21:52.667 --> 03:21:54.666
(all laugh)

03:21:54.666 --> 03:21:56.572
LAURA: I say we get Doty's disguise off of him.

03:21:56.572 --> 03:21:57.659
TALIESIN: All right.

03:21:57.659 --> 03:21:59.627
LAURA: I say we go to sleep.

03:21:59.627 --> 03:22:01.022
LIAM: I start peeling it away.

03:22:01.022 --> 03:22:02.287
SAM: And then what?

03:22:02.287 --> 03:22:04.357
LAURA: Then we get up in the morning, and we pick
up our pretty dresses.

03:22:04.357 --> 03:22:05.258
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:22:05.258 --> 03:22:10.685
LAURA: And we go get you crowned! So we can wear
our pretty dresses.

03:22:10.685 --> 03:22:12.744
TALIESIN: Keep drinking.

03:22:12.744 --> 03:22:16.537
MATT: Everything but the hair comes off. The mask,
the porcelain, everything else comes off.

03:22:16.537 --> 03:22:17.875
LAURA: What about the cloak?

03:22:17.875 --> 03:22:19.886
MATT: The cloak does not come off.

03:22:19.886 --> 03:22:20.971
LAURA: No!

03:22:20.971 --> 03:22:23.454
MATT: Not from just tugging it. It's adhered
pretty strongly.

03:22:23.454 --> 03:22:26.310
LIAM: This is so fucking terrible. I'm so angry.

03:22:26.310 --> 03:22:28.527
(all laugh)

03:22:28.527 --> 03:22:35.710
MARISHA: Tary, going forward, I think you need to
recognize how literal Doty takes things, and maybe

03:22:35.710 --> 03:22:43.656
think maybe more detailedly on how you word
things, maybe?

03:22:43.656 --> 03:22:46.137
SAM: Doty did his job. He protected us.

03:22:46.137 --> 03:22:48.115
MARISHA: From innocent guards.

03:22:48.115 --> 03:22:50.428
SAM: Who were going to arrest us.

03:22:50.428 --> 03:22:52.824
LAURA: Why were they going to arrest you?

03:22:52.824 --> 03:22:56.571
SAM: Because we were arcanists walking loose in
the--

03:22:56.571 --> 03:22:57.933
LAURA: It's not illegal!

03:22:57.933 --> 03:23:07.390
SAM: I was led to believe it was. And I'm a
stranger in this land, and they were trailing us,

03:23:07.390 --> 03:23:14.985
and your cohort over there, the big guy himself,
told me that they were a danger to us, and Doty

03:23:14.985 --> 03:23:22.325
did his job. Listen, you can't blame Doty for the
mistakes that I may have made. I take full

03:23:22.325 --> 03:23:31.194
responsibility for this, and I throw myself at
your feet for mercy. I know I'm new to this team,

03:23:31.194 --> 03:23:39.607
and I hoped that this gift would be a peacemaking
gesture. By the way, you should divide all these

03:23:39.607 --> 03:23:41.729
potions up as you see fit.

03:23:41.729 --> 03:23:43.740
LAURA: We totally should.

03:23:43.740 --> 03:23:55.789
SAM: And I'm sorry if I made mistakes today. But
we're all alive, we have what we need, and we're

03:23:55.789 --> 03:23:58.976
still on an adventure, right?

03:23:58.976 --> 03:24:02.397
TALIESIN: A toast to mistakes--

03:24:02.397 --> 03:24:04.824
SAM: Let's all sing our fight song, shall we?

03:24:04.824 --> 03:24:07.644
TALIESIN: -- and to terrible consequences, to
failure.

03:24:07.644 --> 03:24:09.292
LAURA: How about you go first, Tary.

03:24:09.292 --> 03:24:11.466
MARISHA: Yes, let's learn it from you.

03:24:11.538 --> 03:24:23.299
SAM: Doty, show me what we wrote. (sings) 'Seven
intrepid warriors we, were strong before and

03:24:23.299 --> 03:24:33.818
'stronger with me. Drinking wine and Heroes'
Feasts, saving maidens, defeating beasts. We

03:24:33.818 --> 03:24:44.071
'fight, fight, fight, with strength and girth, I
slew a marid and proved my worth. Vix and Vox,

03:24:44.071 --> 03:24:58.320
'Kiko and Greg, and Percival with the head like an
egg. I defeated a kraken too, and I saved the

03:24:58.320 --> 03:25:06.799
'Ashari single-handedly in the ocean blue. We
fight, fight, fight, with strength and girth. I

03:25:06.799 --> 03:25:12.368
'won your hearts and I proved my worth.'

03:25:12.368 --> 03:25:14.230
TALIESIN: Ooh. Bravo!

03:25:14.230 --> 03:25:16.639
LAURA: Hey!

03:25:16.639 --> 03:25:19.865
SAM: Now you all have fight songs too, don't you?

03:25:19.865 --> 03:25:22.954
TALIESIN: We'll cover that at the next drink. I
think it's time to turn in.

03:25:22.954 --> 03:25:24.225
MARISHA: Hm, yes.

03:25:24.225 --> 03:25:25.170
LAURA: Wow.

03:25:25.170 --> 03:25:28.263
TALIESIN: I'm going to run-- I'm going to get a
little bit of the hardest alcohol that they have,

03:25:28.263 --> 03:25:32.971
preferably a clear alcohol, and ask them if they
have any chicken, like-- or some sort of meat that

03:25:32.971 --> 03:25:34.733
they're about to throw away.

03:25:34.733 --> 03:25:37.630
LAURA: Oh. Chicken.

03:25:37.630 --> 03:25:38.909
TALIESIN: Stop it.

03:25:38.909 --> 03:25:43.263
MATT: They do have some near-spoiling meat. And at
the cost of one gold piece you can get a pretty

03:25:43.263 --> 03:25:44.374
solid bottle.

03:25:44.374 --> 03:25:51.675
TALIESIN: I pop it and I'm just going to try and
start solventing away the glue with grease, with

03:25:51.675 --> 03:25:54.319
fatty grease and alcohol.

03:25:54.319 --> 03:25:57.273
MATT: It'll take you the better part of the
next couple of hours, but you can do it.

03:25:57.321 --> 03:26:00.931
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm just going to try and get this
thing off. Let me try and remove the hair too.

03:26:00.931 --> 03:26:05.859
MATT: You do manage to get the hair off. You don't
get all the glue splotches. Doty now has these,

03:26:05.859 --> 03:26:11.962
like, clusters of nasty-looking glue splotches all
over the head. And of like, taken pieces of

03:26:12.016 --> 03:26:18.162
thread, and fuzz, and dirt and things just from
the atmosphere to him. It looks awful. Doty looks

03:26:18.162 --> 03:26:22.115
awful. But the cloak does come off.

03:26:23.253 --> 03:26:24.849
TALIESIN: We'll have it cleaned, dear.

03:26:24.849 --> 03:26:28.782
LAURA: That's amazing. So worth it, darling, I
can't believe you did that. Thank you.

03:26:28.782 --> 03:26:31.317
LIAM: Does the cloak of Elvenkind look like butt?

03:26:31.317 --> 03:26:32.746
LAURA: It's got clumps of red hair stuck.

03:26:32.746 --> 03:26:36.479
MATT: Only like 10% butt. Like, there is still
glue on it. You have to spend more time.

03:26:36.479 --> 03:26:37.437
LIAM: It worked?

03:26:37.437 --> 03:26:38.428
SAM: Did we take off the mask?

03:26:38.428 --> 03:26:39.830
MATT: If you want to.

03:26:39.830 --> 03:26:41.288
TALIESIN: It looks like the kindergarten class
attacked it.

03:26:41.288 --> 03:26:42.002
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:26:42.002 --> 03:26:43.020
SAM: Should we take off the mask?

03:26:43.020 --> 03:26:43.798
LAURA: Probably.

03:26:43.798 --> 03:26:44.443
TALIESIN: Fucker.

03:26:44.443 --> 03:26:45.633
SAM and TALIESIN: There's another one!

03:26:45.633 --> 03:26:47.081
(all laugh)

03:26:47.132 --> 03:26:50.032
MATT: It's like a hydra, Travis killed one, two
more took its place.

03:26:50.032 --> 03:26:51.531
TRAVIS: It's so strange man, they go up, they come
back down.

03:26:51.531 --> 03:26:56.239
TALIESIN: Arsehole, where did you go? Fuck.
They're huge. Sorry. That was really

03:26:56.239 --> 03:26:58.700
inappropriate.

03:26:58.700 --> 03:27:00.727
MATT: So, as you guys get tired, you could rent a
room for the evening.

03:27:00.727 --> 03:27:01.693
LAURA: Yeah.

03:27:01.693 --> 03:27:02.984
MATT: At the tavern if you'd like, the Siren's
Succor.

03:27:02.984 --> 03:27:04.468
LAURA: Okay, let's rent a room.

03:27:04.468 --> 03:27:08.688
MATT: Okay. So, I'd say for the rooms for all of
you guys tonight, drinking there, mark off ten

03:27:08.688 --> 03:27:10.673
gold, it's fine.

03:27:10.673 --> 03:27:12.248
SAM: For everyone, or each.

03:27:12.248 --> 03:27:12.918
LAURA: For everyone.

03:27:12.918 --> 03:27:13.708
MATT: For everyone.

03:27:13.708 --> 03:27:14.672
SAM: Pf.

03:27:14.672 --> 03:27:15.331
TALIESIN: I know.

03:27:15.331 --> 03:27:16.075
TRAVIS: Yeah.

03:27:16.075 --> 03:27:17.593
SAM: I can take care of this, if you'd like.

03:27:17.593 --> 03:27:18.845
TALIESIN: No, we got this. It's okay.

03:27:18.845 --> 03:27:20.424
LAURA: We've got it. It's fine, Tary.

03:27:20.424 --> 03:27:21.542
TALIESIN: But part of being--

03:27:21.542 --> 03:27:26.610
LIAM: You buy the potions, we pay for the shitty
hotel rooms.

03:27:26.610 --> 03:27:31.644
SAM: (laughs) I don't know if that evens out. But
all right.

03:27:31.644 --> 03:27:36.310
TALIESIN: Don't think of it as a thing that evens
out, think of it as an ever-increasing debt that

03:27:36.310 --> 03:27:39.147
doesn't really ever get paid.

03:27:39.147 --> 03:27:40.979
SAM: I like the way you think, science bro.

03:27:40.979 --> 03:27:42.721
TALIESIN: Cheers.

03:27:42.721 --> 03:27:53.242
MATT: All righty. As you guys rest for the
evening, the morning comes around. You're across

03:27:53.242 --> 03:27:57.317
the board, fairly hung-over, but functional.
Except for Grog, Grog, you're fine. Yay

03:27:57.317 --> 03:28:04.945
constitution 20! But you guys muster yourselves,
get a quick bite to eat downstairs, in the now

03:28:04.996 --> 03:28:13.105
even-more-empty tavern. Your dresses are at the
ready, you go and collect them. What's next, what

03:28:13.105 --> 03:28:16.303
do you guys want to do?

03:28:17.121 --> 03:28:19.155
LAURA: We should go to see your people.

03:28:19.155 --> 03:28:20.850
MARISHA: I mean, we could catch brunch first?

03:28:20.850 --> 03:28:23.121
LAURA: No. We should go to see. Your. People.

03:28:23.121 --> 03:28:23.837
TALIESIN: No.

03:28:23.837 --> 03:28:24.420
LIAM: No.

03:28:24.420 --> 03:28:26.520
MARISHA: All right. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Let's go.

03:28:26.520 --> 03:28:28.488
LIAM: No time like the present.

03:28:28.488 --> 03:28:31.248
LAURA: Wait, what are the colors of Whitestone
again?

03:28:31.248 --> 03:28:35.098
TALIESIN: Lavender, white, blue, gold, silver.

03:28:35.098 --> 03:28:36.913
LAURA: That's the colors I want my dress to be.

03:28:36.913 --> 03:28:38.052
TRAVIS: That's five.

03:28:38.052 --> 03:28:38.837
MATT: Okay.

03:28:38.841 --> 03:28:40.115
LIAM: It's too late, it's black.

03:28:40.115 --> 03:28:41.851
(all laugh)

03:28:41.851 --> 03:28:46.449
TALIESIN: I might add, you do-- Part of taking a
crest is that you actually do get to build

03:28:46.449 --> 03:28:48.863
something of your own.

03:28:48.863 --> 03:28:50.642
LAURA: We need to work on that, Percival.

03:28:50.642 --> 03:28:56.806
TALIESIN: We do. I was-- I feel like I've been
negligent. That we've not been--

03:28:56.806 --> 03:28:59.680
LAURA: You also need to explain to me what
the fucking Grey Hunt is at some point.

03:28:59.734 --> 03:29:06.683
TALIESIN: Yes, we should get to that. I only
know because we've talked about that.

03:29:06.737 --> 03:29:08.171
MATT: Yeah. All right.

03:29:08.171 --> 03:29:09.788
LAURA: Come on, let's go, Keyleth.

03:29:09.788 --> 03:29:12.418
MARISHA: Okay. Let's go.

03:29:12.418 --> 03:29:14.301
LAURA: Antlers upon antlers.

03:29:14.301 --> 03:29:20.413
MATT: All right. And such. With the Transport Via
Plants spell cast into the nearest tree, you guys

03:29:20.413 --> 03:29:24.416
find yourself emerging from one of the
cliffside trees that have grown out of the

03:29:24.480 --> 03:29:32.345
outcropping of stone and rock that marks the
exterior of Zephra. Did you all travel here last

03:29:32.345 --> 03:29:34.054
time, or was it just Keyleth and Vax?

03:29:34.054 --> 03:29:36.945
MARISHA: It was just Vax and Allura--

03:29:36.945 --> 03:29:38.652
MATT: Yeah, Vax. Allura, that's right.

03:29:38.652 --> 03:29:39.313
TALIESIN: Ooh.

03:29:39.313 --> 03:29:41.078
MARISHA: Whom we kind of forgot was with us.
(nervous laugh)

03:29:41.078 --> 03:29:42.523
MATT: That's right, and she was like, "Whatever."

03:29:42.523 --> 03:29:43.664
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:29:43.664 --> 03:29:49.578
MATT: All right, so you guys all emerge, and you
see now, on these extremely tall mountain bluffs,

03:29:49.578 --> 03:29:57.565
the wind is strong on the outskirts, and you can
see, whizzing past you, puffs of cloud, and leaf,

03:29:57.565 --> 03:30:03.316
and dust. But it's all contained on the outside of
this bluff. And before you on the opposite side,

03:30:03.316 --> 03:30:10.058
built deep into this mountain top, you can see
dozens and dozens of structures made from the

03:30:10.058 --> 03:30:15.416
natural stone and bending of long wood slats that
seem to have been curved over into these dome-like

03:30:15.416 --> 03:30:22.245
structures. You see small trees emerging in
places, and even though you are a few hundred feet

03:30:22.245 --> 03:30:28.991
off, you can already see maybe 20 or so various
people just wandering the town, some of which are

03:30:28.991 --> 03:30:35.437
outside working on-- sitting on benches, working on
various crafts. You can see leathers being dried

03:30:35.502 --> 03:30:42.778
out from various hides. You catch the sight of a
griffin that swoops past and disappears into a

03:30:42.778 --> 03:30:46.664
nearby cloud. And looking over the bluff--

03:30:46.664 --> 03:30:47.438
SAM: Cool.

03:30:47.438 --> 03:30:51.631
MATT: -- about ten feet off, this is the drop, goes
down for hundreds of feet before vanishing into

03:30:51.683 --> 03:30:57.717
low-hanging clouds. You guys have no idea how high
up you are, but it seems very high.

03:30:57.717 --> 03:31:00.865
MARISHA: (inhales) Oh man.

03:31:00.865 --> 03:31:01.955
SAM: Are we falling?

03:31:01.955 --> 03:31:03.210
LAURA: Is it super windy?

03:31:03.210 --> 03:31:04.305
MARISHA: No no no, we're on the mountain.

03:31:04.305 --> 03:31:06.959
MATT: You can see a lot of wind rushing just
around you, but it seems like this portion of the

03:31:06.959 --> 03:31:13.420
mountain is almost protected, or at least the
winds are guided in a way where they're not

03:31:13.420 --> 03:31:16.205
affecting this portion of the mountain.

03:31:17.822 --> 03:31:19.208
LAURA: So what do we do?

03:31:19.208 --> 03:31:20.714
LIAM: What happens now, boss?

03:31:20.714 --> 03:31:26.426
MARISHA: I forgot you guys haven't seen my
hometown yet. Okay, all right. Let's go that way.

03:31:26.426 --> 03:31:31.981
Okay. See, over there is where I caught
my first baby griffin--

03:31:31.981 --> 03:31:33.090
TALIESIN: Oh no.

03:31:33.090 --> 03:31:36.622
MARISHA: -- he was lost and got separated from his
mom, and I captured him up, and I tucked him up under

03:31:36.622 --> 03:31:39.300
my shirt. And over there actually--

03:31:39.300 --> 03:31:40.366
TALIESIN: (groans)

03:31:40.366 --> 03:31:42.756
MARISHA: -- I tripped and fell and that was the
first time that I scraped my knee--

03:31:42.756 --> 03:31:43.770
SAM: Amazing.

03:31:43.770 --> 03:31:45.098
MARISHA: -- and I was like, oh no, I'm bleeding.

03:31:45.098 --> 03:31:46.174
SAM: It must have been terrible.

03:31:46.174 --> 03:31:48.503
LAURA: While she was walking, I go behind and do
this to Vax.

03:31:48.503 --> 03:31:49.363
MARISHA: Oh, it was so terrible, yeah.

03:31:49.363 --> 03:31:49.954
LIAM: Ow.

03:31:49.954 --> 03:31:50.719
LAURA: Does it still hurt?

03:31:50.719 --> 03:31:52.503
LIAM: No it's fine, I feel good. I feel really
good.

03:31:52.503 --> 03:31:53.206
LAURA: Yeah?

03:31:53.206 --> 03:31:59.185
LIAM: Yeah, I feel really good. I feel rested. I
feel fucking healthy man. I don't know. I'm

03:31:59.185 --> 03:32:01.634
serious.

03:32:01.634 --> 03:32:05.179
LAURA: All right, that's happy.

03:32:05.179 --> 03:32:06.375
LIAM: (growls)

03:32:06.375 --> 03:32:07.970
LAURA: (growls)

03:32:07.970 --> 03:32:14.923
MATT: As you guys are walking closer to the
outside of Zephra, you see a couple of individuals

03:32:14.923 --> 03:32:19.328
beginning to approach, three or four children,
just seeing these strange visitors in the

03:32:19.328 --> 03:32:25.232
outskirts. They're also keeping low and not trying
to draw your attention too strongly, though they

03:32:25.232 --> 03:32:30.806
are out in the middle of the open. You see a few
bushes and elements. You see two grown individuals

03:32:30.806 --> 03:32:38.598
walking up with the children, one of which appears
to be a relatively young girl, maybe around 13, 14

03:32:38.598 --> 03:32:44.992
years old who pushes the kids to the back and
goes, "Keyleth?"

03:32:45.427 --> 03:32:49.162
MARISHA: Yes, hi, hi. What's your name?

03:32:49.162 --> 03:32:52.974
MATT: "Sora. You used to watch over me when I was
little."

03:32:52.974 --> 03:32:59.901
MARISHA: Oh my goodness, Sora. Wow, last time I
saw you, you were like, like, oh man. Look how big

03:32:59.901 --> 03:33:01.594
you've gotten.

03:33:01.594 --> 03:33:02.665
MATT: "I--"

03:33:02.665 --> 03:33:07.185
MARISHA: Do you still know that handshake? Do you
remember the--

03:33:07.185 --> 03:33:08.734
MATT: It takes a moment for you guys to figure it
out.

03:33:08.734 --> 03:33:10.590
MARISHA: And there, you've got it. You got it.

03:33:10.590 --> 03:33:12.270
MATT: It's slightly awkward, but for the most part
you recall it.

03:33:12.270 --> 03:33:13.230
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah.

03:33:13.230 --> 03:33:14.402
MATT: "I'm much older now, I don't need to--"

03:33:14.402 --> 03:33:15.074
MARISHA: Oh man.

03:33:15.074 --> 03:33:15.991
MATT: "I didn't--"

03:33:15.991 --> 03:33:16.628
MARISHA: You forgot--

03:33:16.628 --> 03:33:17.627
MATT: "You're back."

03:33:17.627 --> 03:33:21.145
MARISHA: Yeah. I guess I am.

03:33:21.145 --> 03:33:24.268
MATT: "We have to tell everyone else."

03:33:24.268 --> 03:33:25.832
MARISHA: Hey, hey.

03:33:25.832 --> 03:33:29.062
MATT: The kids are all just quietly staring
wide-eyed and smiling quietly.

03:33:29.062 --> 03:33:33.701
MARISHA: Sora, Sora. Have you seen my dad around?

03:33:33.701 --> 03:33:35.572
MATT: "Do you want me to get him?"

03:33:35.572 --> 03:33:36.316
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:33:36.316 --> 03:33:36.990
MATT: "Okay."

03:33:36.990 --> 03:33:37.752
MARISHA: Okay.

03:33:37.752 --> 03:33:40.613
MATT: "C'mon, c'mon kids." And takes them by the
hand and they all drag the kids off as you guys

03:33:40.613 --> 03:33:44.524
wait in the outskirts of the city. One of the kids
who didn't quite get a hand on this young

03:33:44.524 --> 03:33:49.330
three-year-old boy who's running behind them
stops. Turns and stares at you all, but stares

03:33:49.330 --> 03:33:53.775
specifically at Grog and is just wide-eyed,
going--

03:33:54.300 --> 03:33:55.793
TRAVIS: Hey.

03:33:55.793 --> 03:33:59.224
MATT: "Hi."

03:33:59.481 --> 03:34:02.502
TRAVIS: Eat your vegetables, you'll look like
this.

03:34:02.502 --> 03:34:06.275
MATT: "Okay."

03:34:06.275 --> 03:34:07.233
TRAVIS: Now get out of here!

03:34:07.233 --> 03:34:08.176
MATT: (yells)

03:34:08.176 --> 03:34:09.402
(all laugh)

03:34:09.402 --> 03:34:12.336
MATT: Just immediately bolts past to catch up with
the rest of the crowd.

03:34:12.336 --> 03:34:16.324
TALIESIN: So I believe you just set up a lifetime
of unreasonable expectations.

03:34:16.324 --> 03:34:17.915
TRAVIS: He'll be healthy, though.

03:34:17.915 --> 03:34:19.756
LAURA: I've never seen Grog eat a single
vegetable--

03:34:19.756 --> 03:34:20.751
TRAVIS: No, fuck those things.

03:34:20.751 --> 03:34:22.608
LAURA: -- the entire time I've known him.

03:34:22.608 --> 03:34:23.740
TALIESIN: I was wondering about that.

03:34:23.740 --> 03:34:26.029
TRAVIS: Nothing in green is good.

03:34:27.080 --> 03:34:32.372
MATT: A short time passes. A few moments, before
you begin to see the city suddenly come to more

03:34:32.372 --> 03:34:37.176
vibrant life. People are stepping out of their
abodes. Dozens of individuals are beginning to

03:34:37.176 --> 03:34:41.400
come together, talking, whispering, and some
looking back and watching you all in the outskirts

03:34:41.400 --> 03:34:45.957
of Zephra, until eventually it seems a procession
of some kind is all gathering and moving out of

03:34:45.957 --> 03:34:52.122
this mass of people in your direction. As you
look, you begin to see people adorned in similar

03:34:52.122 --> 03:34:57.688
clothing as to when you first encountered Keyleth
in the swamps outside of Stillben. You see these

03:34:57.688 --> 03:35:05.466
leather-based, almost scaled-looking armor that
drifts down to the legs. You see people that hold

03:35:05.466 --> 03:35:15.726
giant staffs that hold golds and greens and blue
colors that mark the symbols of the Zephra tribe.

03:35:15.726 --> 03:35:23.966
And then, in the center of them, you've met once
before, you see stepping forth, Korren, the father

03:35:23.966 --> 03:35:31.638
of Keyleth and the current acting Voice of Tempest
of the Zephra. His long white, silver hair

03:35:31.638 --> 03:35:37.782
drifting behind him. He approaches with a look.
Everyone holds back as he steps forth from the

03:35:37.782 --> 03:35:43.773
crowd and ignoring the rest of you, just goes and
beelines straight to Keyleth. You can see him, he

03:35:43.839 --> 03:35:50.368
has a bit of a limp to him that you don't recall
from last time, but he seems other than that in

03:35:50.368 --> 03:35:56.156
good health. As he approaches you, he clasps his
hands out in front of him and takes a good long

03:35:56.156 --> 03:36:01.535
look at you as he reaches out and takes your hands
into his own. "My daughter."

03:36:01.575 --> 03:36:06.129
MARISHA: I just drop to a knee and say, Kaitiyaki,
father.

03:36:06.129 --> 03:36:16.881
MATT: "Kaitiyaki, Keyleth. We've heard that the
defense of Emon was successful, yes?"

03:36:17.389 --> 03:36:26.071
MARISHA: Yes, we have defeated the Chroma
Conclave. The help of Vox Machina and many many

03:36:26.071 --> 03:36:28.883
others, at the cost of many lives.

03:36:28.883 --> 03:36:33.354
MATT: "Good, good. I'm glad we could be of some
aid to your journey."

03:36:33.426 --> 03:36:40.199
MARISHA: Yes, thank you. The Air Ashari were very
valuable during that day. Very courageous.

03:36:40.203 --> 03:36:46.723
MATT: "And we will remember those we lost in that
fray. The great sacrifices that they gave so that

03:36:46.723 --> 03:36:55.052
"these children could live. So?" And at this point,
he now takes notice of the rest of the group. "By

03:36:55.214 --> 03:37:03.685
"what joy do we have of bringing your allies here
and returning to your people?"

03:37:03.975 --> 03:37:06.052
LAURA: He doesn't know.

03:37:06.052 --> 03:37:18.108
MARISHA: Sorry, I thought Uvenda might have said
something. I'm here because I have completed my

03:37:18.108 --> 03:37:21.346
Aramente, and have come for my blessing.

03:37:21.520 --> 03:37:22.451
MATT: "Yes, you have."

03:37:22.451 --> 03:37:24.542
LAURA: (gasps)

03:37:25.162 --> 03:37:28.276
MATT: "I just wanted to hear it from your lips."

03:37:30.143 --> 03:37:37.157
MARISHA: Still waiting on your final word, I
guess.

03:37:37.383 --> 03:37:48.354
MATT: "Well, while we still have daylight, let us
prepare for the ceremony. Come, come, all of you.

03:37:48.354 --> 03:37:59.216
"You are welcome, welcome here in Zephra. We'll
begin, decoration shall commence. Rest, prepare,

03:37:59.439 --> 03:38:04.524
"naught but two or three hours until the ceremony
is to occur." He turns, and folks begin to rush

03:38:04.524 --> 03:38:10.417
in, and people just begin to barrage you with
questions and congratulations, and a number of

03:38:10.417 --> 03:38:14.605
individuals who seem to have heard stories, many
second-hand, and exaggerations of the various

03:38:14.605 --> 03:38:21.517
things that you've accomplished over the past year
or so here in Tal'Dorei. You answer questions, you

03:38:21.517 --> 03:38:26.695
play into the tall tales if you want. One child
turns to you and goes, "And who are you?"

03:38:27.241 --> 03:38:28.662
SAM: Taryon Darrington.

03:38:28.662 --> 03:38:29.945
MATT: "I don't know who you are."

03:38:29.945 --> 03:38:30.669
SAM: You will.

03:38:30.669 --> 03:38:31.415
MATT: "You--"

03:38:31.415 --> 03:38:33.652
(all laugh)

03:38:33.652 --> 03:38:42.044
MATT: There is a massive interest around Grog as
goliaths generally do not travel this far up into

03:38:42.044 --> 03:38:46.385
the territory of the mountain. Most of them stay
far north in the Cliffkeep or wandering the

03:38:46.385 --> 03:38:52.832
dividing plain. They're just swarming you and
climbing up on you and hanging from your arms and

03:38:53.054 --> 03:38:57.324
you feel kind of awkward but kind of enjoying the
attention at the same time.

03:38:57.324 --> 03:38:59.194
TRAVIS: They're really little.

03:38:59.194 --> 03:39:00.915
LAURA: Kind of like gnomes.

03:39:00.915 --> 03:39:02.170
TRAVIS: Yeah. (gasps)

03:39:02.170 --> 03:39:04.069
(all laugh)

03:39:04.069 --> 03:39:05.910
TALIESIN: Well that works, well done.

03:39:05.910 --> 03:39:07.445
TRAVIS: I'm good.

03:39:07.445 --> 03:39:15.726
MATT: Immediately, over the next hour or two,
people begin to gather floral wreaths and strips

03:39:15.726 --> 03:39:20.988
of silk and material that have been prepared
specifically for these types of occasions. Many of

03:39:21.145 --> 03:39:26.131
them new, made from the recent generations in
preparation, many that are held over by tradition

03:39:26.182 --> 03:39:33.030
and by the various leaders that came before you.
Many that may have had the hope of the return of

03:39:33.030 --> 03:39:38.463
Vilya, but instead, carry through with memory of
Keyleth. As this transpires, you guys are brought

03:39:38.463 --> 03:39:47.024
food, you are gathered into a central open
celebration. Almost like a pit that descends about

03:39:47.024 --> 03:39:52.214
two feet, and there are a number of stools and
tables, and food and drink are brought about. As

03:39:52.214 --> 03:39:57.616
opposed to an event and then a celebration
afterward, it seems to be a reverse here at

03:39:57.616 --> 03:40:03.971
Zephra. It's a build-up. It's everyone, the
excitement grows. As this is happening, you glance

03:40:04.026 --> 03:40:10.669
off and there is one very large, singular tree
right across the way, at the very edge of the

03:40:10.669 --> 03:40:16.848
precipice of this rocky outcropping that holds
most of the city of Zephra. And there at the edge

03:40:16.848 --> 03:40:24.801
you see one large, twisting, gnarled tree that
curves upward. Not quite Sun Tree in height and

03:40:24.801 --> 03:40:30.527
size, but still very elegant and beautiful with
long, thin branches that gently sway on the

03:40:30.527 --> 03:40:35.748
outskirts of whatever barrier seems to bend and
twist the winds from coming and scattering the

03:40:35.748 --> 03:40:42.504
village. You watch as people step up to it, and
they're leaving jewelry, they're putting large

03:40:42.504 --> 03:40:47.229
ribbons across it. Elements of it remind you of
the tree that was in the center of the temple in

03:40:47.229 --> 03:40:55.956
Vesrah, though a different texture. It seems to be
a deep, vibrant, healthy dark brown, and with

03:40:55.956 --> 03:41:03.558
elements of gray bark, with moss that grow at the
base and tuck under the branches, where the

03:41:03.558 --> 03:41:11.086
shadows tend to linger throughout the day.
Eventually, it seems that they have returned and

03:41:11.086 --> 03:41:19.848
the decor is set, benches have been moved, and
most of the people of Zephra are now shifting in

03:41:19.848 --> 03:41:21.744
the direction of this tree.

03:41:21.744 --> 03:41:26.406
LIAM: In all the hubbub and the movement, a few
moments before, I've been watching for Korren, and

03:41:26.406 --> 03:41:30.492
when I see him alone for a second, I make a
beeline toward him.

03:41:30.492 --> 03:41:34.633
MATT: He's in the process of a conversation. And
it's interesting. During this whole thing, he was

03:41:34.633 --> 03:41:40.171
excited to see you and that you've come, but he's
also-- he's kept a strange distance from you

03:41:40.171 --> 03:41:49.454
during this preparation. He smiles, and you guys
meet eyes occasionally, but he's also just

03:41:49.454 --> 03:41:55.977
focusing on this endeavor, and then you kind of
come out of the blue. "Ah, yes, Vax'ildan."

03:41:56.028 --> 03:42:00.119
LIAM: Forgive me. Might I have just a moment?

03:42:00.119 --> 03:42:03.369
MATT: "Quickly. We're about to begin, but yes."

03:42:03.369 --> 03:42:12.132
LIAM: I will be brief. I just wanted to take a
moment to say, I really wish you could've seen

03:42:12.132 --> 03:42:26.896
some of the things she has done. I know you are
proud of her. I've never met anyone like her.

03:42:26.896 --> 03:42:36.313
She's going to do your people very proud. I'm
grateful.

03:42:36.366 --> 03:42:38.845
MATT: "As are we all."

03:42:41.302 --> 03:42:43.324
LIAM: You've a lot to do.

03:42:43.683 --> 03:42:51.074
MATT: "As do you. As does she." And he reaches out
and pats you on the head and ruffles your hair a

03:42:51.074 --> 03:42:57.476
little bit. And even that feels a little awkward
for him, like he felt impulsive to do it, and then

03:42:57.476 --> 03:43:01.923
'oh, that wasn't very-- mm.'

03:43:01.923 --> 03:43:05.385
LIAM: It's all right. It's more than I ever got.

03:43:06.107 --> 03:43:10.578
TALIESIN: Whoa. Ow.

03:43:10.578 --> 03:43:12.240
SAM: Darkness.

03:43:12.240 --> 03:43:21.798
MATT: "Anyway. Come. It's nearly time." And as all
of you are led over, there are spaces at the very

03:43:21.805 --> 03:43:27.431
front of the ceremony, in the semicircle around
this tree. There are platforms set up at the base

03:43:27.431 --> 03:43:37.901
of this tree now. Amongst these hundreds of
various, dangling threads, these small pieces of

03:43:37.901 --> 03:43:42.698
paper that flitter on the outskirts of the gentle
wind that pushes through. You guess they might

03:43:42.698 --> 03:43:48.275
contain wishes or passages or something, but you
see bits of script written on them amongst the

03:43:48.325 --> 03:43:55.369
various glinting pieces of glass and gems and
stone that have been polished. It's small, but beautiful.

03:44:00.065 --> 03:44:07.789
Eventually, you're led to sit in the center of this
semi-circle, and as everyone gathers and takes

03:44:07.962 --> 03:44:12.125
their seat, you hear the occasional kid crying
and people muttering to themself, and eventually

03:44:12.125 --> 03:44:20.974
everyone shushes as Korren, now wearing a very old
ceremonial long light blue and white robe

03:44:20.974 --> 03:44:31.524
wearing what looks to be some sort of a somewhat
tattered, like a scarf that's wrapped around his

03:44:31.524 --> 03:44:35.349
neck and drapes off each of his arms. It's thick and
it's long and it almost touches the ground around

03:44:35.349 --> 03:44:42.763
him, but you can tell from the way he holds it, and 
his arms consistently rest at this crooked position

03:44:42.763 --> 03:44:52.162
that it has some symbolism to this ceremony. As
he steps up under the tree and turns around

03:44:52.162 --> 03:44:58.734
everyone gets very quiet, and the wind seems
to almost stop on the outside of this barrier.

03:44:58.786 --> 03:45:07.624
The rushing, perpetual gust of air
seems to almost hold its breath for this. He

03:45:07.624 --> 03:45:18.008
clears his throat. And as he looks up to everyone,
you swear this tree begins to slowly produce

03:45:18.008 --> 03:45:30.283
cherry blossoms as his words continue. "For long,
we of the winds have awaited the procession of our

03:45:30.283 --> 03:45:39.737
"tradition. With the passing of our elder voice,
Dwala, it was my wife Vilya who was selected to

03:45:39.737 --> 03:45:48.797
"take the Aramente. Beautiful and full of
determination, she accepted her path. And while

03:45:48.797 --> 03:45:57.968
"she did not return to us, the destiny she set is
now seen as one of preparation. Her journey was

03:45:57.968 --> 03:46:09.113
"not in vain, for it was her love that produced our
daughter. It was her guidance in joy that taught

03:46:09.113 --> 03:46:19.320
"our child compassion. It was her discipline and
understanding that forged young Keyleth's spark of

03:46:19.320 --> 03:46:31.563
"intuition and unlocked her adept connection with
nature and the winds. We mourn the loss of our

03:46:31.563 --> 03:46:42.223
"Vilya, but take pride that she lives on in the
eyes of our own, returned, beloved woman of the

03:46:42.223 --> 03:46:51.596
"winds. Here we bring together our collective
voices to bless upon my daughter, the memory of

03:46:51.596 --> 03:47:02.285
"Vilya, the champion of Guasar, the mantle of our
destiny." And as he puts his arms up, from around

03:47:02.285 --> 03:47:08.483
you to each side, Keyleth, you watch as young
acolytes begin to approach from each side, arms

03:47:08.483 --> 03:47:17.464
down. All seemingly carrying these various pieces
of dark green, leather-like material. And as they

03:47:17.464 --> 03:47:27.744
come together, they latch them into place and
slowly build this mantle. "Ring clear our voices

03:47:27.911 --> 03:47:35.520
"to unite our breath and grant our strength to her
guidance and wisdom, as Keyleth takes the rightful

03:47:35.520 --> 03:47:44.010
"and earned responsibility of leading our people
into this next generation." At this point, the

03:47:44.010 --> 03:47:51.849
assembled mantle is placed into Korren's arms. And
you now see this beautiful neck and shoulder piece

03:47:51.849 --> 03:48:01.992
that rests past to the elbows, but limp and without
body, in his hands. As he holds it there and the

03:48:02.053 --> 03:48:06.352
rest of the acolytes step back and find their
place, seated, he lifts his arms up a bit and

03:48:06.352 --> 03:48:20.033
begins to just sing a singular note (sings). And
everyone around you in Zephra begins to join in in

03:48:20.033 --> 03:48:24.352
this singular note. Do you choose to join in as
well?

03:48:24.352 --> 03:48:25.035
TRAVIS: Yeah.

03:48:25.035 --> 03:48:26.311
LAURA: Sure.

03:48:26.311 --> 03:48:32.098
MATT: As you do, the notes begin to separate and
harmonize instinctually. It creates this symphony,

03:48:32.098 --> 03:48:39.915
this beautiful tangling of hundreds of voices from
all across the spectrum. And what at first may

03:48:39.915 --> 03:48:49.947
seem to resemble a discordant hymn, finds this
perfect spread of every note you've ever heard,

03:48:49.947 --> 03:48:59.418
musically merging as one. As he does this,
instinctually, Keyleth, without even thinking, you

03:48:59.418 --> 03:49:07.959
rise and begin to walk towards him. Like the
spirits of generations before you are lifting you

03:49:07.959 --> 03:49:13.592
by your shoulders and elbows, and bring you up
before your father. You find the breath leave your

03:49:13.592 --> 03:49:16.521
lungs, the inside of your mouth is dry.

03:49:16.521 --> 03:49:17.615
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:49:17.615 --> 03:49:21.874
MATT: You're unable to understand what it is
that's driving you, but before you know it you're

03:49:21.874 --> 03:49:27.810
standing before your father, looking up into his
eyes as all of these voices just swirl around you,

03:49:27.810 --> 03:49:33.733
this weird warmth. The nerves in your stomach
still climb to the top and vibrate within your

03:49:33.733 --> 03:49:41.927
chest. As your father places this mantle over your
head and shoulders, and it comes to rest on you,

03:49:41.927 --> 03:49:54.131
heavier than you expected, but it fits well. As he
places this, the green fades to a golden brown and

03:49:54.131 --> 03:50:05.026
red and orange and yellow. And the green leaves
almost drip back into a long, springing trail of a

03:50:05.026 --> 03:50:13.506
cloak behind you that seems to grow with each
passing surge of these voices around her, until it

03:50:13.506 --> 03:50:24.150
reaches the ground and curls behind.
Eventually the cloak stops. The voices soften, and

03:50:24.212 --> 03:50:33.441
come to silence, as you look up once more into
your father's face. "Rise, my daughter, and become

03:50:33.441 --> 03:50:47.446
"Keyleth, Voice of the Tempest." He steps back and
bows his head. Steps off the platform. And you

03:50:47.446 --> 03:50:55.844
stand and turn, and it's just you at the base of
tree, looking about at all of Zephra before you,

03:50:55.844 --> 03:51:01.439
quiet, silent. And your friends before you, at the
front of the crowd.

03:51:12.119 --> 03:51:25.059
MARISHA: Didn't think I'd make it here. I couldn't
have done any of this without not only the support

03:51:25.059 --> 03:51:46.690
of every person in Zephra, and every person of the
Ashari tribe, members of Emon, Tal'Dorei, Marquet,

03:51:46.690 --> 03:52:06.740
even Wildmount. In my journeys, I've learned being
a leader is a global effort, one that takes the

03:52:06.740 --> 03:52:20.818
wisdom of many. Most importantly, I couldn't have
done any of this without Vox Machina. And the

03:52:20.818 --> 03:52:29.972
pieces of them that I've taken away and have
desperately tried to emulate in each one of them

03:52:29.972 --> 03:52:43.519
over the years. Each one of them with qualities
that I admire and strive to embrace. Grog, with

03:52:43.519 --> 03:53:02.930
his strength and his unyielding loyalty. Vex, with
her self-confidence and utter fearlessness. Vax is

03:53:02.930 --> 03:53:13.389
one of the most compassionate people I think I've
ever come across and one of the most brave, even

03:53:13.389 --> 03:53:31.060
if it's maybe foolish. Percival, with your
intelligence and your sensibility, is always there

03:53:31.060 --> 03:53:46.126
to be my balance. Scanlan, with his charisma and
his wit. Pike--

03:53:46.126 --> 03:53:50.999
MATT: As you glance past the group, you can see
just the faint flutter of golden light and energy.

03:53:50.999 --> 03:53:53.975
Wherever she is, a part of her is watching.

03:53:53.975 --> 03:54:08.064
MARISHA: Pike, her generosity and her
authenticity, always true to herself. And even

03:54:08.064 --> 03:54:21.406
Tary. Taryon Darrington, whose blind faith in Vox
Machina and perseverance, trusted us even though

03:54:21.406 --> 03:54:25.045
he probably shouldn't have.

03:54:26.915 --> 03:54:29.488
SAM: (whispers) You're incredible.

03:54:35.343 --> 03:54:44.992
MARISHA: All of these things that I learned and
couldn't be a leader without. Vox Machina makes up

03:54:45.053 --> 03:55:15.098
me. Zephra makes up me. The Ashari people, and all
of greater Exandria. I don't know if I'm the

03:55:15.098 --> 03:55:28.000
leader that you deserve, or a good leader, but I'm
willing to dedicate the rest of my life to doing

03:55:28.000 --> 03:55:37.717
whatever I can for all of us. As long as Vox
Machina stands by my side.

03:55:43.099 --> 03:55:50.565
MATT: At this point, you watch as the light that
remains of the eventually soon-to-come setting sun

03:55:50.565 --> 03:55:56.277
glints across the cheek of Keyleth, the bit of
damp tear that has rolled down her cheek just

03:55:56.277 --> 03:56:03.198
detaches from the edge of her chin and hits the
bottom of the stone. Every cherry blossom in the

03:56:03.198 --> 03:56:11.250
tree releases, and drifts past her from behind,
before getting caught up in the wind just past

03:56:11.250 --> 03:56:21.826
her, causing this swirl of pinks and reds and
whites behind her. Everyone around rises up, and

03:56:21.826 --> 03:56:29.202
they all begin to cheer and clap. All together.
You look around and watch the rest of these

03:56:29.202 --> 03:56:37.374
blossoms slowly drift. You look and see your
friends around you. You look around and you see

03:56:37.374 --> 03:56:43.693
your mother, out of the corner of your eye, just
the memory of her. You sense that if she could be

03:56:43.693 --> 03:56:54.798
here, she would've been. Your father steps up and
takes your hands and just says, "I'm so proud of

03:56:54.798 --> 03:57:06.179
"you. And there's much to be done, I know, but I'm
proud of you." And he takes your hand, and holds

03:57:06.179 --> 03:57:15.504
it up once more. "To the Voice of the Tempest. And
the future of our people." Everyone cheers once

03:57:15.504 --> 03:57:16.546
more together.

03:57:16.546 --> 03:57:17.930
SAM: To Vox Tempesta!

03:57:17.930 --> 03:57:21.516
(all laugh)

03:57:21.809 --> 03:57:25.014
MATT: And with that, you gain the Inspiring Leader
feat.

03:57:25.014 --> 03:57:26.520
MARISHA: What? I get the what now?

03:57:26.520 --> 03:57:30.701
MATT: Inspiring Leader feat, as the end of your
Aramente.

03:57:30.701 --> 03:57:34.185
TRAVIS: Oh, shit, Voice of the Tempest!

03:57:36.223 --> 03:57:41.881
MATT: Which is pretty fun. What that allows you to
do is--

03:57:41.881 --> 03:57:43.820
TRAVIS: You can never die.

03:57:43.820 --> 03:57:52.058
MATT: No, you can totally die. You can spend ten
minutes inspiring your companions, shoring up

03:57:52.058 --> 03:57:57.156
their resolve to fight. When you do so, choose up
to six friendly creatures, which can include

03:57:57.156 --> 03:58:01.028
yourself, within 30 feet that can hear and
understand you. Each creature can gain temporary

03:58:01.028 --> 03:58:04.051
hit points equal to your level plus your charisma
modifier.

03:58:04.244 --> 03:58:07.991
MARISHA: Oh, what! Well, you guys are out of luck
with the charisma modifier shit, but what!

03:58:07.991 --> 03:58:09.842
(all laugh)

03:58:09.842 --> 03:58:13.267
MATT: And they can only gain the temporary hit
points from this until they finish a short or long

03:58:13.267 --> 03:58:17.370
rest. So every short rest you can give everyone 17
temporary hit points.

03:58:17.370 --> 03:58:22.061
MARISHA: That is fucking dope!

03:58:22.127 --> 03:58:23.865
SAM: You have to give a speech every time.

03:58:24.324 --> 03:58:27.388
MATT: Essentially, you take ten minutes to talk
everybody up. So start practicing.

03:58:27.388 --> 03:58:28.988
MARISHA: Jeez, no.

03:58:32.674 --> 03:58:34.248
MATT: And we'll leave it there for the evening.

03:58:34.307 --> 03:58:36.108
LAURA: Oh, man.

03:58:36.108 --> 03:58:38.645
TRAVIS: That was gorgeous, man. That was
gorgeous.

03:58:38.645 --> 03:58:40.264
LAURA: With the tree, man.

03:58:40.264 --> 03:58:46.315
MATT: That was awesome. Completed your Aramente,
took up the mantle, and, apparently, going to the

03:58:46.315 --> 03:58:49.648
Iron City of Dis soon. That's going to be fun.

03:58:50.318 --> 03:58:51.933
TRAVIS: (sings) We built this-- No, no more.

03:58:51.933 --> 03:58:54.034
LAURA: No more of Dis City.

03:58:54.912 --> 03:58:58.898
TALIESIN: I came up with great formal wear for
you, too. It's a shame we didn't get a chance. I

03:58:58.898 --> 03:59:02.128
figured you out.

03:59:02.128 --> 03:59:03.092
TRAVIS: We'll see.

03:59:03.092 --> 03:59:03.850
TALIESIN: All right.

03:59:03.850 --> 03:59:05.042
TRAVIS: Grog has a very discerning taste.

03:59:05.042 --> 03:59:06.742
TALIESIN: I'm very proud I came up with an idea.

03:59:06.742 --> 03:59:09.785
LAURA: Well, I'm glad we went with the blue dress
after that cape turned all the other colors of

03:59:09.785 --> 03:59:11.908
nature and it's like, you are covered.

03:59:11.908 --> 03:59:13.558
MARISHA: Yes.

03:59:13.558 --> 03:59:16.988
(all laugh)

03:59:16.988 --> 03:59:22.109
TRAVIS: Covered, girl.

03:59:22.109 --> 03:59:26.185
MATT: Well done, guys. Thank you again, Loot Crate,
for being our awesome sponsor.

03:59:26.237 --> 03:59:27.723
ALL: Loot Crate!

03:59:27.723 --> 03:59:29.689
TRAVIS: Matt, you did a great job.

03:59:29.689 --> 03:59:33.721
MATT: You guys are always such an absolute
pleasure. Thank you for playing in my weird

03:59:33.721 --> 03:59:35.880
make-up world.

03:59:37.581 --> 03:59:40.873
TALIESIN: How long have you been working on that
speech, man? That was nuts.

03:59:40.873 --> 03:59:42.993
MATT: Oh, that was fun. I've been waiting for
everybody to get to that moment.

03:59:42.993 --> 03:59:46.386
SAM: Improv-ed it.

03:59:46.505 --> 03:59:48.083
MATT: Glad you survived to get there.

03:59:48.083 --> 03:59:50.505
MARISHA: No shit.

03:59:51.077 --> 03:59:54.737
LIAM: Died in Stillben, game three.

03:59:55.829 --> 03:59:58.481
MARISHA: And send out the next one.

03:59:58.535 --> 04:00:03.534
MATT: All right. We'll be back next week, to see
where the next leg of Vox Machina's adventure

04:00:03.534 --> 04:00:09.184
takes them. Until then, have a wonderful night,
have a wonderful weekend, and is it Thursday yet?

04:00:09.184 --> 04:00:11.343
Take care guys.

04:00:11.343 --> 04:00:13.240
(all cheer)
