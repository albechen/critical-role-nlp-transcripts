(no audible dialogue)

00:00:11.067 --> 00:00:14.067
MATT: My name is Matthew Mercer,
Dungeon Master for the show.

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:16.100
Welcome to the
chaos of this evening.

00:00:16.133 --> 00:00:18.901
Before we get into
our actual game story,

00:00:18.934 --> 00:00:21.334
and the thread of what has
transpired in recent events,

00:00:21.367 --> 00:00:23.434
we're gonna go through
our quick announcements.

00:00:23.467 --> 00:00:27.501
First and foremost, tonight's
episode is sponsored by us!

00:00:27.534 --> 00:00:29.501
Sponsored by the new year.

00:00:29.534 --> 00:00:31.200
Sponsored by, hopefully,

00:00:31.234 --> 00:00:33.801
have our sponsor
contracts finalized soon,

00:00:33.834 --> 00:00:35.667
and we can have an
actual sponsor soon,

00:00:35.701 --> 00:00:37.234
but until then,
we are sponsored

00:00:37.267 --> 00:00:41.100
by you awesome people who
come and watch the show.

00:00:41.133 --> 00:00:42.634
I think Sam had
prepared a bit.

00:00:42.667 --> 00:00:45.067
SAM: What-- I, yeah,
I prepared a bit.

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:46.901
That's pretty much it.

00:00:46.934 --> 00:00:48.667
Now, I'm gonna need
a little quiet,

00:00:48.701 --> 00:00:50.968
because we've gotten a
lot of feedback from fans,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.384
and so, this new feature
we're gonna roll out.

00:00:53.384 --> 00:00:55.033
We're gonna have
a telephone number

00:00:55.067 --> 00:00:57.000
that people can call
and complain to,

00:00:57.033 --> 00:00:58.767
so I just wanted to--

00:00:58.801 --> 00:01:01.453
I think I can use this mic
if everyone can be quiet.

00:01:01.453 --> 00:01:04.733
I'm gonna just record our
outgoing message for the--

00:01:04.766 --> 00:01:08.267
the new phone line that
we're setting up right now.

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:10.067
So stand by.

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.868
Thank you for calling
Critical Role customer support.

00:01:12.901 --> 00:01:16.467
We value from your feedback and
want to improve your experience.

00:01:16.501 --> 00:01:18.278
If you're calling
to argue against

00:01:18.278 --> 00:01:21.801
one of Matthew Mercer's many,
many rule violations, press one.

00:01:21.834 --> 00:01:23.100
If you're calling to cry

00:01:23.133 --> 00:01:25.534
because Ashley Johnson
isn't on this episode,

00:01:25.567 --> 00:01:28.801
mash your forehead into
your number pad repeatedly.

00:01:28.834 --> 00:01:31.300
If you're calling to lodge a
complaint about Marisha Ray

00:01:31.334 --> 00:01:32.634
or the character of Keyleth,

00:01:32.667 --> 00:01:34.734
or how nothing she
ever does is cool,

00:01:34.767 --> 00:01:36.334
press three.

00:01:36.367 --> 00:01:39.267
You will be given five minutes
to rant and don't worry.

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:43.634
Your message will make Marisha
feel like shit within 24 hours.

00:01:43.667 --> 00:01:45.567
Quiet, guys.

00:01:45.601 --> 00:01:47.100
If you would
like to complain about

00:01:47.133 --> 00:01:49.100
the technical
aspects of the Twitch stream,

00:01:49.133 --> 00:01:51.901
please hang up and
call 1-800-hashtag

00:01:51.934 --> 00:01:54.934
W-E-K-N-O-W.

00:01:54.968 --> 00:01:57.901
If you are offended by something
Sam Riegel said on the stream,

00:01:57.934 --> 00:01:59.801
you can go
fuck yourself.

00:01:59.834 --> 00:02:01.100
Thank you for
your support.

00:02:01.133 --> 00:02:02.334
Okay, that's it.

00:02:02.367 --> 00:02:03.434
MATT: Good, good.

00:02:03.467 --> 00:02:07.968
(laughter, applause)

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.032
(talking over each other)

00:02:11.067 --> 00:02:13.934
LIAM: Pick up.

00:02:13.968 --> 00:02:15.737
Can I just, on behalf
on all of us?

00:02:15.737 --> 00:02:19.501
(humming)

00:02:19.534 --> 00:02:21.167
MATT: We miss you, Ashley.

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:22.968
We miss you.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.257
LAURA: Always, always.

00:02:24.257 --> 00:02:25.868
TRAVIS: Start crying before
the show starts.

00:02:25.901 --> 00:02:27.340
MARISHA: I look forward to
all the voicemails.

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:28.767
-SAM: Uh-huh.
-LAURA: Yeah, so many.

00:02:28.801 --> 00:02:29.767
LIAM: It's already full.

00:02:29.801 --> 00:02:31.501
TALIESIN: Yeah.

00:02:31.534 --> 00:02:33.501
It's like our very own
This American Life episode.

00:02:33.534 --> 00:02:35.801
-I'm so excited.
-MARISHA: Yeah.

00:02:35.834 --> 00:02:38.567
MATT: Thank you, Sam, for
that fantastic message.

00:02:38.601 --> 00:02:41.100
LIAM: Wow!

00:02:41.133 --> 00:02:42.767
MATT: We have some-- I think,
some merch updates

00:02:42.767 --> 00:02:44.133
if you want to
take that, Laura.

00:02:44.167 --> 00:02:45.400
LAURA: Oh, yes, we do!

00:02:45.434 --> 00:02:48.267
So if you guys check
the store right now,

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:52.200
there should be some Strongjaw
Ale shirts available.

00:02:52.234 --> 00:02:54.200
I was getting some tweets
about it, that, you know,

00:02:54.234 --> 00:02:56.033
we hadn't put those in
store for a long time,

00:02:56.067 --> 00:02:57.734
so, we made some more
and put them in the store.

00:02:57.767 --> 00:02:59.371
Along with the
Gilmore shirts, and the

00:02:59.371 --> 00:03:00.634
How do you want
to do this?

00:03:00.667 --> 00:03:01.934
and the regular
logo shirt.

00:03:01.968 --> 00:03:04.400
All of those things
available plus there are some

00:03:04.434 --> 00:03:06.000
How do you want to
do this? hoodies left

00:03:06.033 --> 00:03:08.100
from the pre-order stock
that we had a long time ago,

00:03:08.133 --> 00:03:11.000
so, there's a few of those
left in the store, and...

00:03:11.033 --> 00:03:12.000
(ding)

00:03:12.033 --> 00:03:13.567
I have a tweet.

00:03:13.601 --> 00:03:15.868
Sorry.

00:03:15.901 --> 00:03:19.234
Sorry about that, and
we also have these new,

00:03:19.267 --> 00:03:20.501
wait, where'd I put it?

00:03:20.534 --> 00:03:22.033
-LIAM: On the back of your book.
-LAURA: Where's my book?

00:03:22.067 --> 00:03:24.434
-LIAM: This is it.
-LAURA: Oh, I have it out.

00:03:24.467 --> 00:03:27.367
We have vinyl stickers now,
you guys.

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:28.767
Aren't they so spiffy?

00:03:28.801 --> 00:03:30.601
TRAVIS: Oh, yeah, look at it.

00:03:30.634 --> 00:03:32.601
LAURA: Yeah, I'm excited
about those, so those are--

00:03:32.634 --> 00:03:33.601
Those are here.

00:03:33.634 --> 00:03:34.601
Those are in the
store for you.

00:03:34.634 --> 00:03:36.567
-SAM: For sale?
-LAURA: For sale, Sam!

00:03:36.601 --> 00:03:38.534
TRAVIS: Do we get them for free,
do we get them?

00:03:38.567 --> 00:03:39.734
LAURA: You get-- you get--
you want one?

00:03:39.767 --> 00:03:41.334
-LIAM: Heavily discounted.
-LAURA: Here you go.

00:03:41.367 --> 00:03:42.934
-LIAM: Heavily discounted.
-LAURA: Do you guys want some?

00:03:42.968 --> 00:03:44.000
MARISHA: Yeah!

00:03:44.033 --> 00:03:46.767
I'll put it on
my white car.

00:03:46.801 --> 00:03:49.200
(laughter)

00:03:49.234 --> 00:03:51.133
LAURA: So, yeah, there's
all that stuff.

00:03:51.167 --> 00:03:53.300
SAM: Amazing.

00:03:53.334 --> 00:03:54.901
-TRAVIS: Those are awesome.
-LAURA: Yeah.

00:03:54.934 --> 00:03:56.100
And we have
more hats too.

00:03:56.133 --> 00:03:57.467
There's hats again.

00:03:57.501 --> 00:03:58.634
All these things, you guys.

00:03:58.667 --> 00:03:59.701
Just so many things.

00:03:59.734 --> 00:04:01.701
-TALIESIN: Loot!
-MATT: We're trying to keep up.

00:04:01.734 --> 00:04:03.734
LAURA: Yeah, we're trying to do away
with, like, the whole, you know,

00:04:03.767 --> 00:04:06.267
pre-order and wait a really
long time to get your stuff,

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:07.634
so, now we're trying
to keep things in stock

00:04:07.667 --> 00:04:08.901
so you can
actually buy it.

00:04:08.934 --> 00:04:10.133
TRAVIS: Yeah, trying to get
it to you sooner.

00:04:10.167 --> 00:04:11.501
LAURA: Yeah!

00:04:11.534 --> 00:04:13.667
MATT: Alright, thank you, Laura.

00:04:13.701 --> 00:04:15.534
Also want to mention for those
who want to check it out.

00:04:15.567 --> 00:04:17.767
We've been running it
for a few months now,

00:04:17.801 --> 00:04:19.834
but we have our
Talks Machina

00:04:19.868 --> 00:04:21.857
Critical Role after-show
Tuesday nights,

00:04:21.857 --> 00:04:24.501
7:00PM Pacific time

00:04:24.534 --> 00:04:27.467
And Alpha.
It's hosted by our amazing Brian Foster.

00:04:27.501 --> 00:04:28.734
TRAVIS: He's a dick!

00:04:28.767 --> 00:04:30.968
MATT: He is a dick, and
that's part of his charm.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.367
But yeah, so if you
haven't checked it out,

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.834
you can come and watch us
answer your community questions

or ask questions to
the @TalksMachina Twitter

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:40.801
and watch us fumble
our way through

00:04:40.834 --> 00:04:42.667
trying to explain
our inane actions

00:04:42.701 --> 00:04:43.734
in the dice
role-playing RPG

00:04:43.767 --> 00:04:45.734
we play
every week.

00:04:45.767 --> 00:04:47.133
Anyway, check that out.

00:04:47.167 --> 00:04:48.467
Anybody else have anything
else they want to talk about

00:04:48.501 --> 00:04:51.934
or mention or--
or say something?

00:04:51.968 --> 00:04:53.100
TRAVIS: Say-- say something?

00:04:53.133 --> 00:04:54.167
MATT: Say something?

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:55.300
MARISHA: You guys want
to say anything?

00:04:55.334 --> 00:04:56.434
You didn't say
anything this time.

00:04:56.467 --> 00:04:58.267
Do you want to say how
much you love everybody?

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:00.434
-SAM: Huh?
-LAURA: Oh, man.

00:05:00.467 --> 00:05:04.334
MATT: Alright, let's go ahead and get
us down to tonight's episode.

00:05:04.367 --> 00:05:05.767
SAM: Bring on the catharsis!

00:05:05.801 --> 00:05:06.934
MATT: Of Critical Role!

00:05:06.968 --> 00:05:08.434
(yelling)

00:05:08.467 --> 00:05:12.167
LAURA: Oh God, I got to--

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:13.567
SAM: We're not out,
we're not out.

00:05:13.601 --> 00:05:15.934
TRAVIS: We're not--

00:05:15.968 --> 00:05:17.334
(screaming)

00:05:17.367 --> 00:05:20.801
♪

00:05:20.834 --> 00:05:22.767
(electricity crackling)

00:05:22.801 --> 00:06:30.968
♪

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:40.834
MATT: Hello everyone
and welcome back.

00:06:40.868 --> 00:06:42.067
So, get you up to speed

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:43.901
with what's recently
happened in our game.

00:06:43.934 --> 00:06:45.868
Vox Machina, our
band of adventurers,

00:06:45.901 --> 00:06:47.701
have been traveling
across Tal'Dorei,

00:06:47.734 --> 00:06:50.400
continents and planes
of existence beyond,

00:06:50.434 --> 00:06:52.133
in search of the
Vestiges of Divergence.

00:06:52.167 --> 00:06:53.834
Magical artifacts that
can help outfit them

00:06:53.868 --> 00:06:56.667
for their coming struggle
against the Chroma Conclave,

00:06:56.701 --> 00:06:59.200
a group of chromatic
dragons that had terrorized

00:06:59.234 --> 00:07:01.801
and conquered the
Tal'Dorei countryside

00:07:01.834 --> 00:07:03.567
for quite some time now.

00:07:03.601 --> 00:07:04.934
At the end of
this venture,

00:07:04.968 --> 00:07:07.400
you've all, acquiring
your relics of power,

00:07:07.434 --> 00:07:09.234
your levels of experience,

00:07:09.267 --> 00:07:11.801
and the allies you've amassed
through this journey,

00:07:11.834 --> 00:07:14.367
converged upon the central
capitol city of Emon

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:15.767
in hopes of
finally defeating

00:07:15.801 --> 00:07:17.968
and destroying
Thordak, The Cinder King.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.501
You made a tenuous
relationship

00:07:19.534 --> 00:07:20.834
with a member
of the Conclave,

00:07:20.868 --> 00:07:24.601
Raishan, the Diseased
Deceiver, the green dragon,

00:07:24.634 --> 00:07:28.267
and after killing the other
three members of the Conclave,

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:30.467
you went in with
armies at your back,

00:07:30.501 --> 00:07:32.467
Ashari in the sky,

00:07:32.501 --> 00:07:33.767
who laid siege to the city

00:07:33.801 --> 00:07:35.434
as you snuck beneath
the streets of Emon,

00:07:35.467 --> 00:07:39.000
emerging on the outskirts
of the Cloudtop district

00:07:39.033 --> 00:07:42.501
through the help of your two
allies: Zahra and Kashaw.

00:07:42.534 --> 00:07:44.534
You managed to bypass
two waiting fire giants,

00:07:44.567 --> 00:07:46.634
push straight into the center

00:07:46.667 --> 00:07:49.300
of the mostly ruined
cloud topped district

00:07:49.334 --> 00:07:51.567
where you confronted
Thordak, The Cinder King,

00:07:51.601 --> 00:07:56.300
in his large, swollen powerful,
primordial red dragon form.

00:07:56.334 --> 00:07:57.834
(shivers)

00:07:57.868 --> 00:07:59.200
LAURA: Sorry.

00:07:59.234 --> 00:08:01.934
-TALIESIN: I was with you.
-TRAVIS: Gross.

00:08:01.968 --> 00:08:03.200
MATT: It's a favored
enemy, right?

00:08:03.234 --> 00:08:04.734
Just checking.

00:08:08.701 --> 00:08:12.667
You came prepared with--
with allies at your sides

00:08:12.701 --> 00:08:15.200
and full power
you tore into Thordak

00:08:15.234 --> 00:08:17.217
and while many
blows were sustained

00:08:17.217 --> 00:08:18.667
on both sides
of the fray,

00:08:18.701 --> 00:08:21.701
Thordak fell on
the battlefield.

00:08:21.734 --> 00:08:24.033
In those moments,
as Thordak attempted

00:08:24.067 --> 00:08:26.834
to retreat into his lair,

00:08:26.868 --> 00:08:31.234
you, Vax, gave chase
and slew the dragon

00:08:31.267 --> 00:08:33.767
using Whisper
in your grasp.

00:08:33.801 --> 00:08:38.167
As a few of you came up
behind, Raishan, as well,

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:40.267
asked as part of the
accord you had made

00:08:40.299 --> 00:08:43.734
to be given some time
with the corpse of Thordak.

00:08:43.767 --> 00:08:47.033
It was decided that
this was not to be allowed.

00:08:47.067 --> 00:08:50.534
She was not to be trusted,
and an attack was made on Raishan.

00:08:50.567 --> 00:08:52.100
Though Raishan
also had made

00:08:52.133 --> 00:08:55.801
a few unique choices of
her own leading up to it.

00:08:55.834 --> 00:09:00.434
This led to a confrontation in
Thordak's lair beneath the city

00:09:00.467 --> 00:09:03.400
where you
all nearly got

00:09:03.434 --> 00:09:07.734
your asses
handed to you.

00:09:07.767 --> 00:09:11.334
By-- by a
well-prepared Raishan.

00:09:11.367 --> 00:09:13.801
However, in the midst
of this battle,

00:09:13.834 --> 00:09:17.868
you did summon your
ally, J'Mon Sa Ord.

00:09:17.901 --> 00:09:19.934
They're the leader
of Ank'Harel,

00:09:19.968 --> 00:09:21.767
the distant city on the
continent of Marquet,

00:09:21.801 --> 00:09:25.300
and a brass dragon, who
upon arriving in this fray,

00:09:25.334 --> 00:09:27.334
full health and
ready to fight,

00:09:27.367 --> 00:09:29.901
was enough of a threat
to drive Raishan off

00:09:29.934 --> 00:09:32.567
in her damaged form before
she could finish you off

00:09:32.601 --> 00:09:34.167
in your-- the
state you were in.

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:35.267
SAM: So, it was worth it.

00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:36.267
TALIESIN: Yeah, it was
definitely worth it.

00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:37.267
LAURA: Yeah!

00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:39.000
TALIESIN: Yeah, it was worth it.

00:09:39.033 --> 00:09:41.434
MATT: However, you were
then kept at bay

00:09:41.467 --> 00:09:44.934
by a wall of force
as Raishan took two

00:09:44.968 --> 00:09:49.634
of Thordak's strangely
existing eggs

00:09:49.667 --> 00:09:53.067
and flew into a tunnel
towards the corpse of Thordak

00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:55.734
and then disappeared in
a flash of purple energy

00:09:55.767 --> 00:09:57.300
before the wall dropped

00:09:57.334 --> 00:09:59.767
and you all just arrived
halfway through the tunnel

00:09:59.801 --> 00:10:01.901
where the corpse
of Thordak once lay

00:10:01.934 --> 00:10:03.968
to find it missing
along with Raishan

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.701
and the eggs that
she had gathered.

00:10:06.734 --> 00:10:08.567
And that was where
we had left off.

00:10:08.601 --> 00:10:12.667
So, as the rest of your
party begins running up,

00:10:12.701 --> 00:10:15.534
winded, bloodied
and still reeling

00:10:15.567 --> 00:10:18.467
from the intensity of the
battle you just fought,

00:10:18.501 --> 00:10:21.167
you have the intense
heat of a nearby cavern,

00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:24.400
the hints of-- of cracked
red-hot Earth and rock

00:10:24.434 --> 00:10:26.634
that are kind of protruding
in small sections.

00:10:26.667 --> 00:10:28.434
The sweat just
pouring down your face.

00:10:28.467 --> 00:10:30.067
You run up and
you can see the trail.

00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:33.701
The pool of blood that once
was driven by the wounds

00:10:33.734 --> 00:10:38.000
left by your blade at the side
of Thordak's corpse-- missing.

00:10:38.033 --> 00:10:40.434
The impact crater
of Thordak's landing

00:10:40.467 --> 00:10:44.334
still carved into the
side of this curved tunnel.

00:10:44.367 --> 00:10:46.834
You see, as
Kima rushes up.

00:10:46.868 --> 00:10:49.200
Out of breath,
you see Gilmore rush up

00:10:49.234 --> 00:10:50.434
and push his hair 
out of his face

00:10:50.467 --> 00:10:51.801
and there's a
moment of silence

00:10:51.834 --> 00:10:55.968
as you all kind of take
in what has just transpired.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.767
What do you want to do?

00:10:58.801 --> 00:11:00.534
TRAVIS: Using my magic,
can I detect

00:11:00.567 --> 00:11:04.400
which direction
the beast fled?

00:11:04.434 --> 00:11:07.267
-MATT: No.
-TRAVIS: Okay.

00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:09.100
I don't know anything.

00:11:09.133 --> 00:11:10.367
LAURA: Should we get,
I don't know,

00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:12.033
does it matter to
get any of his blood?

00:11:12.067 --> 00:11:13.968
Maybe we can
track him easier?

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.267
-MARISHA: Yeah.
-LAURA: The body?

00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:18.300
SAM: Thordak's blood?

00:11:18.334 --> 00:11:19.701
LAURA: Yeah, Thordak's blood.

00:11:19.734 --> 00:11:21.567
MATT: Okay, so you go
ahead and you pull--

00:11:21.601 --> 00:11:23.267
Do you have empty
vials currently?

00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:25.734
LAURA: I took a lot of potions,
so I'm assuming so.

00:11:25.767 --> 00:11:27.133
MATT: Yes, you would
actually, so yeah.

00:11:27.167 --> 00:11:29.567
So you take some
of the-- the mostly

00:11:29.601 --> 00:11:32.100
or completely emptied healing
potion vials and collect--

00:11:32.133 --> 00:11:33.834
LAURA: I lick,
I lick the bottle

00:11:33.834 --> 00:11:37.501
for all the
remaining healing.

00:11:37.534 --> 00:11:38.901
-MATT: Little straw.
-LAURA: Like a Capri-Sun.

00:11:38.934 --> 00:11:40.601
MATT: Yeah, exactly.

00:11:40.634 --> 00:11:43.067
Okay.

00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:46.801
MARISHA: I head back
into the chamber

00:11:46.834 --> 00:11:49.000
and see if I can
find any of, like,

00:11:49.033 --> 00:11:52.668
Raishan's scales or,
like, Raishan blood or...

00:11:52.668 --> 00:11:54.234
LAURA: Maybe give it a moment

00:11:54.267 --> 00:11:56.801
just to let the lair actions
die down a little bit.

00:11:56.834 --> 00:11:58.167
LIAM: What?

00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:00.868
LAURA: The-- you know, all the lava
stuff happening in there.

00:12:00.901 --> 00:12:03.334
MARISHA: I'll watch from a distance
and make sure that, you know,

00:12:03.367 --> 00:12:04.434
it's not boiling over.

00:12:04.467 --> 00:12:06.000
-LAURA: It's safe?
-MARISHA: Yeah.

00:12:06.033 --> 00:12:07.901
LIAM: I'm gonna limp up to you.

00:12:07.934 --> 00:12:09.734
You're burnt all over.

00:12:09.767 --> 00:12:11.234
-MARISHA: Yeah.
-LIAM: Hold still for a second.

00:12:11.267 --> 00:12:12.300
MARISHA: That really sucks.

00:12:12.334 --> 00:12:14.400
I want to assume
that was karma.

00:12:14.434 --> 00:12:15.801
-Yeah.
-LIAM: Alright.

00:12:15.834 --> 00:12:17.033
I do have--

00:12:17.067 --> 00:12:18.767
MARISHA: I feel really bad
for that duergar now.

00:12:18.801 --> 00:12:19.834
That sucks.

00:12:19.868 --> 00:12:21.167
That's a
rough way to go.

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:22.868
(laughter)

00:12:22.901 --> 00:12:24.767
LIAM: I cover her mouth with
my hand for a second

00:12:24.801 --> 00:12:27.167
and use the last of
Lay on Hands and I--

00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:29.167
I checked with CritRoleStats,
I do have ten left.

00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:30.467
MATT: Okay.

00:12:30.501 --> 00:12:32.801
LIAM: So I'm gonna use
eight, eight of those

00:12:32.834 --> 00:12:34.901
to heal you up a bit.

00:12:34.934 --> 00:12:36.868
-MARISHA: Okay.
-LAURA: Eight whole points.

00:12:36.901 --> 00:12:38.734
-LIAM: I only got ten.
-LAURA: Romeo.

00:12:38.767 --> 00:12:40.701
What do you do
with those last two?

00:12:40.734 --> 00:12:42.200
TALIESIN: I just imagine
like light slapping

00:12:42.234 --> 00:12:43.901
in the face
just eight times.

00:12:43.934 --> 00:12:46.033
Pow, hit point, hit point.

00:12:46.067 --> 00:12:49.234
MARISHA: Lay on Hands,
Lay on Hands.

00:12:49.267 --> 00:12:53.667
LIAM: One, two, three,
four, five, six.

00:12:53.701 --> 00:12:57.133
MATT: The Oath of Annoyance Paladin.

00:12:57.167 --> 00:12:58.834
Coming soon in the
Tal'Dorei campaign book.

00:12:58.868 --> 00:13:00.234
LIAM: Thordak died like this.

00:13:00.267 --> 00:13:02.133
(laughter)

00:13:02.167 --> 00:13:06.300
MATT: Alright, so as
Vax heals you up

00:13:06.334 --> 00:13:09.234
with some of the remnants
of his divine power still--

00:13:09.267 --> 00:13:12.467
still in his body.

00:13:12.501 --> 00:13:15.701
Kima's kind of walking
up to Keyleth

00:13:15.734 --> 00:13:17.467
and Gilmore goes over
and starts helping you

00:13:17.501 --> 00:13:20.834
gather and
separate some of the--

00:13:20.868 --> 00:13:22.000
What little blood you can.

00:13:22.033 --> 00:13:23.501
A lot of its kind
of just dug into the--

00:13:23.534 --> 00:13:26.300
the rock and the dust
but there are a little bit

00:13:26.334 --> 00:13:27.901
that you can kind
of pull into it.

00:13:27.934 --> 00:13:29.834
It's not too
clustered and filled

00:13:29.868 --> 00:13:33.801
with the equivalent
of coffee grinds.

00:13:33.834 --> 00:13:35.634
What else are
you guys doing?

00:13:35.667 --> 00:13:38.667
TALIESIN: Once the lair is safe, I want to
get in and start examining it.

00:13:38.701 --> 00:13:39.934
-MARISHA: Same.
-LAURA: Yeah.

00:13:39.968 --> 00:13:41.801
MATT: Okay.

00:13:41.834 --> 00:13:45.534
It takes, I'd say,
probably a good two minutes

00:13:45.567 --> 00:13:49.868
or so before the--

00:13:49.901 --> 00:13:53.801
the general tremors of
the lair begin to subside.

00:13:53.834 --> 00:13:58.200
The presence of Thordak
being long enough removed

00:13:58.234 --> 00:14:01.300
that the volcanic
activity begins

00:14:01.334 --> 00:14:03.734
to come to a
small, gentle end.

00:14:03.767 --> 00:14:05.834
LAURA: Actually, before
we go back in,

00:14:05.868 --> 00:14:08.801
can I peek up on
the surface level

00:14:08.834 --> 00:14:10.601
and see if it looks like
the fighting has died down?

00:14:10.634 --> 00:14:12.234
LIAM: I was just about
to say the same.

00:14:12.267 --> 00:14:13.334
MATT: Uh, okay, you
guys go up there?

00:14:13.367 --> 00:14:14.367
-LAURA: Yeah.
-LIAM: Yeah.

00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:15.801
MATT: Okay.

00:14:15.834 --> 00:14:17.124
Everyone else staying down?

00:14:17.124 --> 00:14:18.334
-TRAVIS: Yep.
-(Same) Yeah.

00:14:18.367 --> 00:14:19.701
MATT: Okay, while you
guys are waiting,

00:14:19.734 --> 00:14:21.801
the two of you
rush up to the surface.

00:14:21.834 --> 00:14:24.634
The outside of the opening
to Thordak's lair.

00:14:24.667 --> 00:14:26.621
Both of you guys
make perception checks.

00:14:26.621 --> 00:14:27.655
TRAVIS: Don't die.

00:14:32.968 --> 00:14:34.934
-LAURA: Twenty-seven.
-LIAM: Twenty-nine.

00:14:34.968 --> 00:14:36.300
MATT: Okay.

00:14:36.334 --> 00:14:40.067
As you both
peek through the--

00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:42.000
the heated clouds
of soot and ash

00:14:42.033 --> 00:14:43.868
that are billowing
out from inside,

00:14:43.901 --> 00:14:46.868
your vision clarifies and
you can see up into the sky

00:14:46.901 --> 00:14:48.834
the thunderstorm that
has been encompassing

00:14:48.868 --> 00:14:50.033
the vicinity of Emon.

00:14:50.067 --> 00:14:51.667
It's still rolling
and firing off

00:14:51.701 --> 00:14:53.284
bolts of lightning
and thunder.

00:14:53.284 --> 00:14:54.901
(imitates thunder clap)

00:14:54.934 --> 00:14:56.767
In the distance.

00:14:56.801 --> 00:14:58.367
It is beginning
to slowly subside

00:14:58.400 --> 00:14:59.868
to the size that it began,

00:14:59.901 --> 00:15:02.334
but you also notice
that the wyvern riders

00:15:02.367 --> 00:15:06.234
that once rapidly
swung through the air

00:15:06.267 --> 00:15:07.734
are all retreating en masse.

00:15:07.767 --> 00:15:10.634
The few that still remain
into the southwest end of,

00:15:10.667 --> 00:15:13.577
now maybe, about a
half mile off Emon,

00:15:13.577 --> 00:15:15.200
and a number of
them are fleeing

00:15:15.234 --> 00:15:16.794
and catching up with them.

00:15:16.794 --> 00:15:19.934
It looks like they're
being fended off

00:15:19.968 --> 00:15:21.801
and the tides, at least,
have turned somewhat

00:15:21.834 --> 00:15:25.734
from where they
began here in Emon.

00:15:25.767 --> 00:15:27.968
You also do
notice that the--

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:29.701
the two doors that you
guys originally entered,

00:15:29.734 --> 00:15:31.868
that you pushed through?

00:15:31.901 --> 00:15:33.868
One of the doors is now
pushed off of its hinges

00:15:33.901 --> 00:15:35.067
and has fallen
to the ground.

00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:36.701
The other is kind
of partway off that--

00:15:36.734 --> 00:15:39.767
that giant gate doorway,
and just beyond it,

00:15:39.801 --> 00:15:43.634
you see what looks
to be battle still ensuing.

00:15:43.667 --> 00:15:48.634
You hear the muffled screams
echoing from outside that gate

00:15:48.667 --> 00:15:51.300
and streets beyond in Emon
of hundreds of soldiers

00:15:51.334 --> 00:15:52.834
shouting into battle.

00:15:52.868 --> 00:15:57.801
Large heaving war cries
of deep voiced giant-kin.

00:15:57.834 --> 00:15:59.767
You see bursts of
flame in the distance

00:15:59.801 --> 00:16:00.868
and what looks
to be bodies

00:16:00.901 --> 00:16:02.200
occasionally flung
through the air

00:16:02.234 --> 00:16:07.033
to disappear past the
horizon beyond the gate top.

00:16:07.067 --> 00:16:10.067
This-- there is still
warfare raging in this city.

00:16:10.100 --> 00:16:14.334
LIAM: Can we see through that gate to
where we parted with Kashaw?

00:16:14.367 --> 00:16:16.601
MATT: From this distance, you
cannot get that much more.

00:16:16.634 --> 00:16:17.834
You can just
see the motion of--

00:16:17.868 --> 00:16:19.133
You have to get closer.

00:16:19.167 --> 00:16:21.133
LAURA: So, we can't-- can
I reach into my shirt

00:16:21.167 --> 00:16:23.701
and grab out that note
that was on the arrow?

00:16:23.734 --> 00:16:25.334
I never read it.

00:16:25.367 --> 00:16:27.200
-MATT: Oh, yeah.
-LAURA: What is it?

00:16:27.234 --> 00:16:30.067
MATT: It says, My gift to you,
darling, use it well.

00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:32.601
LAURA: Oh, I knew it!

00:16:32.634 --> 00:16:35.534
We have to find them.

00:16:35.567 --> 00:16:37.090
LIAM: Let's go look.

00:16:40.234 --> 00:16:43.167
-Just a look.
-LAURA: Just stealth.

00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:46.534
To see if it looks
like the giant is gone,

00:16:46.567 --> 00:16:48.267
and if Zahra and
Kash are around.

00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:49.934
LIAM: Why don't we just cover
like half the distance?

00:16:49.968 --> 00:16:51.167
-See what we can see from there.
-LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:52.267
MATT: Okay, stealth
check both you guys.

00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:55.834
♪

00:16:55.868 --> 00:16:57.000
LIAM: Twenty-eight.

00:16:57.033 --> 00:17:00.400
♪

00:17:00.434 --> 00:17:03.534
LAURA: Twelve.

00:17:03.567 --> 00:17:04.834
-MATT: Wow.
-LAURA: I know.

00:17:04.867 --> 00:17:07.165
MATT: Okay.

00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:10.400
LAURA: I'm-- you know, I've--
I'm injured grievously.

00:17:10.434 --> 00:17:12.501
MATT: You are.

00:17:12.534 --> 00:17:14.834
You snatched from the
jaws of death temporarily,

00:17:14.867 --> 00:17:17.934
you find yourself
physically affected

00:17:17.968 --> 00:17:19.334
more than you
would have expected

00:17:19.367 --> 00:17:21.334
and what seemed to you as
just an instant of darkness,

00:17:21.367 --> 00:17:23.434
and as you begin to try and
follow after your brother,

00:17:23.467 --> 00:17:25.968
you find yourself stumbling
and falling to one knee

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:27.133
and trying
best to keep up.

00:17:27.165 --> 00:17:28.267
LAURA: Oh, shit.

00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:30.367
MATT: At this time, you
notice two figures

00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:34.000
running from the opening in
that gate in your direction.

00:17:34.033 --> 00:17:37.267
You see it first, but you
see it for a moment after him.

00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:39.834
You see bloodied, bruised,
but still in a full sprint

00:17:39.868 --> 00:17:43.434
both Kashaw and Zahra
rushing in your direction

00:17:43.467 --> 00:17:47.567
and you hear Kash
just yelling out,

00:17:47.601 --> 00:17:49.567
"Vox Machina!

00:17:49.601 --> 00:17:51.067
You're alive, right?"

00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:52.968
LAURA: Keep it down, you fuck!

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:56.267
Come on, come on
into this hole.

00:17:56.300 --> 00:17:58.934
MATT: "Hole?"
"Yes, the hole, darling."

00:17:58.968 --> 00:17:59.934
"Right."

00:17:59.968 --> 00:18:01.200
And they both rush up

00:18:01.234 --> 00:18:05.100
and as you guys are
catching up with them,

00:18:05.133 --> 00:18:08.667
you notice, by the gate,
pushing through

00:18:08.701 --> 00:18:11.434
what looks to be
another fire giant

00:18:11.467 --> 00:18:13.300
wielding a sword
kind of dragged behind,

00:18:13.334 --> 00:18:16.167
kind of pour through.

00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:18.033
(yells)

00:18:18.067 --> 00:18:20.200
And just begins
going into a--

00:18:20.234 --> 00:18:21.868
a large bounding
sprint in your direction.

00:18:21.901 --> 00:18:23.734
-LAURA: Oh, God.
-LIAM: Running.

00:18:23.767 --> 00:18:25.400
LAURA: Giants, giants at the door.

00:18:25.434 --> 00:18:26.834
-Giants!
-TALIESIN: I am moving towards it.

00:18:26.868 --> 00:18:28.300
TRAVIS: Yeah, now we're all going
on up towards the hole.

00:18:28.334 --> 00:18:30.934
-MATT: Okay.
-LAURA: Can I shoot an arrow at him?

00:18:30.968 --> 00:18:33.968
MATT: As you're saying "giants"
into your ear,

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:37.968
you watch as two
crossbow bolts kinda...

00:18:39.367 --> 00:18:41.534
into the back of the head
of the giant and giant goes...

00:18:41.567 --> 00:18:43.667
and stops and looks
over the shoulder

00:18:43.701 --> 00:18:47.467
and you see a flash
of light behind him.

00:18:47.501 --> 00:18:51.267
An impact into the back of the
black ironed giant's armor.

00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:54.367
Like a sudden impact of a fiery
meteor just slams into it.

00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:55.400
(yells)

00:18:55.434 --> 00:18:56.567
And the giant
stumbles to one knee

00:18:56.601 --> 00:18:58.300
before another blow
hits him right across

00:18:58.334 --> 00:18:59.667
the back of the head
and the fire giant

00:18:59.701 --> 00:19:03.400
just falls on face first
unconscious onto the ground.

00:19:03.434 --> 00:19:07.534
Little cloud of dust and dirt
kind of billows up to the sides.

00:19:07.567 --> 00:19:10.000
There you see, by
the front of the gate,

00:19:10.033 --> 00:19:13.701
you see Jarret with crossbow
right there and standing,

00:19:13.734 --> 00:19:16.300
and now stepping up onto the
back of the giant's armor

00:19:16.334 --> 00:19:20.234
and slamming a flashing
bright radiant war hammer

00:19:20.267 --> 00:19:21.968
into the back of its neck.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.834
You see,
in chain mail,

00:19:24.868 --> 00:19:28.133
long beard,
white streaked,

00:19:28.167 --> 00:19:29.734
billowing war torn
hair pulled into

00:19:29.767 --> 00:19:33.067
a tight ponytail
towards the back,

00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:34.167
a familiar face.

00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:36.968
You see Kerrek,
currently of white--

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:41.300
of Westruun standing,
wipes his brow

00:19:41.334 --> 00:19:43.400
and looks up and takes notice
of your presence immediately.

00:19:43.434 --> 00:19:45.167
Patrick, if you want
to come on the stage.

00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:46.334
LAURA: What the fuck?

00:19:46.367 --> 00:19:49.400
(applause, cheers)

00:19:49.434 --> 00:19:52.334
SAM: Geez, Louise!
Patrick Rothfuss.

00:19:52.367 --> 00:19:57.334
LAURA: Scooch on by since it's
so easy to make your way.

00:19:57.367 --> 00:19:58.467
(laughing)

00:19:58.501 --> 00:20:01.267
MATT: Our set is so conducive
to movement.

00:20:01.300 --> 00:20:03.701
TRAVIS: Oh!

00:20:03.734 --> 00:20:04.767
I didn't break it.

00:20:04.801 --> 00:20:07.767
-LAURA: The whole set falls down.
-MATT: I know!

00:20:07.801 --> 00:20:09.267
LAURA: Kerrek, you can fight!

00:20:09.300 --> 00:20:10.467
PATRICK: I get to sit
next to my besty.

00:20:10.501 --> 00:20:12.000
MARISHA: Yeah!

00:20:12.033 --> 00:20:13.761
My new besty.

00:20:16.534 --> 00:20:18.267
-LIAM: What in the fuck?
-LAURA: I thought you were--

00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:22.033
I thought--
you can fight?

00:20:22.067 --> 00:20:23.834
PATRICK: Uh.

00:20:23.868 --> 00:20:26.968
LAURA: Uh, yeah, you just brought
down a giant, no big deal.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:30.067
PATRICK: Uh, team effort.

00:20:30.100 --> 00:20:31.434
Like is everything cool now?

00:20:31.467 --> 00:20:33.000
Like is this
the last of them?

00:20:33.033 --> 00:20:34.467
MATT: For one, I think you might
want to move a little bit over

00:20:34.501 --> 00:20:35.567
to get into the camera.

00:20:35.601 --> 00:20:37.300
TRAVIS: Yes, come on over.

00:20:37.334 --> 00:20:38.434
MATT: Just a smidge
for the audience.

00:20:38.467 --> 00:20:40.434
-LAURA: Yeah.
-LIAM: Yeah, yeah.

00:20:40.467 --> 00:20:42.267
MATT: There you go,

00:20:42.300 --> 00:20:44.501
and as you've been in this
fray for quite some time

00:20:44.534 --> 00:20:47.467
and the exhaustion's starting
to mount on you a bit,

00:20:47.501 --> 00:20:49.434
and the--

00:20:49.467 --> 00:20:50.968
the two individuals
that you and your--

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.167
your allies have come upon,
being the smaller unit,

00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:55.303
you manage to penetrate
further into the city

00:20:55.303 --> 00:20:59.200
then the main armies that were
pushing towards the gates.

00:20:59.234 --> 00:21:02.801
You saw the
golden-armored human

00:21:02.834 --> 00:21:05.534
and the Tiefling
currently struggling with,

00:21:05.567 --> 00:21:07.868
what looked to be,
five fire giants.

00:21:07.901 --> 00:21:11.734
Three that had come up behind
the two that they had ensnared,

00:21:11.767 --> 00:21:14.367
and after minutes of battle

00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:15.601
and tearing through them

00:21:15.634 --> 00:21:16.968
it looks like you
finally gain the upper hand.

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:18.534
You've lost a number
of allies through this--

00:21:18.567 --> 00:21:20.100
this incursion, however,

00:21:20.133 --> 00:21:22.767
these are the really, really
familiar welcome faces

00:21:22.801 --> 00:21:26.067
given the perpetual
onslaught that you've seen

00:21:26.100 --> 00:21:29.450
since you first
arrived in Emon.

00:21:31.033 --> 00:21:34.601
PATRICK: He--he probably just says,

00:21:34.634 --> 00:21:36.300
"Is it done?"

00:21:36.334 --> 00:21:37.467
LAURA: Is it?

00:21:37.501 --> 00:21:39.067
PATRICK: That's his--
that's his opener.

00:21:39.100 --> 00:21:42.067
LAURA: I mean, eh.

00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:43.100
LIAM: Ish.

00:21:43.133 --> 00:21:45.801
LAURA: Thordak was killed.

00:21:45.834 --> 00:21:49.300
MATT: Kashaw pipes up and says,
"So you killed the thing?

00:21:49.334 --> 00:21:50.868
You killed it,
it's dead, right?"

00:21:50.901 --> 00:21:51.968
LAURA: Mm-hmm.

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:52.968
MATT: "Please tell me
you killed the thing."

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:53.968
LAURA: Yes, the thing is dead.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:55.540
-LIAM: We killed thing.
-LAURA: And gone.

00:21:55.540 --> 00:21:57.067
Literally, gone.

00:21:57.100 --> 00:21:58.801
-MATT: "Great."
-LAURA: Stolen.

00:21:58.834 --> 00:22:01.200
MATT: "Fantastic, that's--
that's wonderful, great."

00:22:01.234 --> 00:22:03.467
-"We can go home."
-PATRICK: Stolen?

00:22:03.501 --> 00:22:05.434
LAURA: Can I hug Zahra?

00:22:05.467 --> 00:22:07.701
MATT: Yeah, she-- she
eagerly puts her arms out

00:22:07.734 --> 00:22:10.334
and as you guys kind
of embrace real fast,

00:22:10.367 --> 00:22:13.467
she kind of-- both of you
almost, from the impact,

00:22:13.501 --> 00:22:15.434
stop, the bruising sets in.

00:22:15.467 --> 00:22:17.467
-MATT: "Darling, careful."
-LAURA: Yeah, yeah, I know, darling.

00:22:17.501 --> 00:22:18.968
Injured.

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.667
PATRICK: How-- how do
these guys look?

00:22:21.701 --> 00:22:24.434
MATT: You don't see them yet,
you just see these two.

00:22:24.467 --> 00:22:25.968
And after a moment
of these hugs happen,

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:27.567
you kind of
catch your breath.

00:22:27.601 --> 00:22:29.434
You notice a few
more figures appear

00:22:29.467 --> 00:22:31.467
from out of this large
craterous hole in the ground

00:22:31.501 --> 00:22:33.300
in the center of
this ruined district,

00:22:33.334 --> 00:22:35.868
and from there you watch
as the familiar Percival,

00:22:35.901 --> 00:22:38.434
Scanlan, oh no,
you stay behind?

00:22:38.467 --> 00:22:43.033
Grog and Keyleth all
emerge from the hole.

00:22:45.601 --> 00:22:47.133
PATRICK: How's she look?

00:22:47.167 --> 00:22:48.601
SAM: Whoo!

00:22:48.634 --> 00:22:51.067
MATT: A little-- a little
singed, a little burned.

00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:53.854
A little worse
for wear, but alive.

00:22:53.854 --> 00:22:55.344
Can't say that
much different

00:22:55.344 --> 00:22:57.100
from the rest of
her allies as well.

00:22:57.133 --> 00:22:58.634
PATRICK: Okay.

00:23:03.367 --> 00:23:07.167
I might actually kind of lumber
a little bit in that direction

00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:11.601
as if I were going in for a hug,
and then stop when I remember

00:23:11.634 --> 00:23:13.400
that maybe I'm not
that sort of person.

00:23:13.434 --> 00:23:15.367
(laughter)

00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:17.467
It looks-- it looks
actually very awkward.

00:23:17.501 --> 00:23:20.701
(laughter)

00:23:20.734 --> 00:23:21.934
TALIESIN: Oh, good.

00:23:21.968 --> 00:23:23.734
This is-- this is a face
I would like to see.

00:23:23.767 --> 00:23:26.667
MARISHA: Kerr?

00:23:26.701 --> 00:23:29.467
LAURA: He just killed
a giant with his

00:23:29.501 --> 00:23:32.467
giant hammer of
blazing white--

00:23:32.501 --> 00:23:34.934
MARISHA: Keyleth just
closes the distance

00:23:34.968 --> 00:23:38.000
and runs up and
just hugs Kerr.

00:23:38.033 --> 00:23:41.400
PATRICK: Big bear hug,
big bear hug.

00:23:41.434 --> 00:23:44.244
MARISHA: What are you doing here?

00:23:45.267 --> 00:23:47.300
PATRICK: Same as everyone.

00:23:47.334 --> 00:23:52.167
Been doing-- doing as
much as a person can do.

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:56.167
MARISHA: I got your gift.

00:23:56.200 --> 00:23:59.767
PATRICK: I'm so glad of that.

00:23:59.801 --> 00:24:02.601
-MARISHA: It meant everything.
-PATRICK: Oh.

00:24:02.634 --> 00:24:05.901
MARISHA: Maybe even a little
too literally, like--

00:24:05.934 --> 00:24:08.968
like 20 minutes ago.

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:12.133
A lot of passing through
fire here lately.

00:24:12.167 --> 00:24:14.434
PATRICK: Yeah.

00:24:14.467 --> 00:24:16.634
TALIESIN: To break the
awkward briefly, dear.

00:24:16.667 --> 00:24:18.667
TRAVIS: Yeah, much
war still happening.

00:24:18.701 --> 00:24:20.968
-LAURA: Maybe we should go down.
-TALIESIN: Wait!

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:24.567
MARISHA: I sky write up in the air,
is there like a--

00:24:24.601 --> 00:24:27.100
like a sigil of Emon?

00:24:27.133 --> 00:24:28.400
Like a--

00:24:28.434 --> 00:24:31.200
MATT: I mean, there is a
crest for the city.

00:24:31.234 --> 00:24:33.334
You can do a simplified
version of it, if you like.

00:24:33.367 --> 00:24:36.267
MARISHA: I do that into the
sky with Sky Write.

00:24:36.300 --> 00:24:38.367
MATT: Okay, so the storm,
which is still raging,

00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:41.100
but it's moving itself
southwest to almost follow the--

00:24:41.133 --> 00:24:44.033
the wyvern riders that have
survived this battle so far

00:24:44.067 --> 00:24:46.467
and are fleeing
from the scene.

00:24:46.501 --> 00:24:49.267
The clouds then begin
to shift and shape

00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:51.200
and the darkness separates
into what looks like

00:24:51.234 --> 00:24:52.601
little plumes of white

00:24:52.634 --> 00:24:56.334
that spell out a very basic
rendition of the symbol of Emon.

00:24:56.367 --> 00:24:59.267
♪

00:24:59.300 --> 00:25:01.133
What else you wanna do?

00:25:01.167 --> 00:25:02.234
TRAVIS: Is Kash there?

00:25:02.267 --> 00:25:03.887
MATT: Kash is there
with you guys.

00:25:03.887 --> 00:25:05.901
-TRAVIS: How's he look?
-TALIESIN: Yeah.

00:25:05.934 --> 00:25:08.100
MATT: He looks pretty messed up.

00:25:08.133 --> 00:25:10.234
There are a few large
sections of armor

00:25:10.267 --> 00:25:12.200
that have been
just cloven through

00:25:12.234 --> 00:25:17.167
and you see a number
of flesh wounds sustained

00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:19.200
but nothing mortal, but he--

00:25:19.234 --> 00:25:21.501
He holds himself
with a kind of a

00:25:21.534 --> 00:25:23.467
knowing confidence
with his arms crossed,

00:25:23.501 --> 00:25:24.868
but as soon as any sort
of physical movement,

00:25:24.901 --> 00:25:26.467
there is a little
bit of a wheeze

00:25:26.501 --> 00:25:28.300
and a trying to cover
for the physical impact

00:25:28.334 --> 00:25:29.934
of the battle
he's just sustained.

00:25:29.968 --> 00:25:32.841
TRAVIS: You look a little
worse for the wear there.

00:25:33.504 --> 00:25:35.434
MATT: "I don't know what
you mean, I'm sorry."

00:25:35.467 --> 00:25:38.701
TRAVIS: Oh, I'm sorry.
Z, did he go unconscious?

00:25:38.734 --> 00:25:40.767
MATT: "Actually, no, he
fought quite bravely."

00:25:40.801 --> 00:25:42.634
-TRAVIS: Are you lying?
-MATT: "No."

00:25:42.667 --> 00:25:44.467
-TRAVIS: Shit.
-MARISHA: She's lying.

00:25:44.501 --> 00:25:47.968
TRAVIS: Good job,
I guess, Kash.

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:50.534
MATT: He goes, "You didn't
too bad yourself, big man."

00:25:50.567 --> 00:25:51.667
Smacks you on the
shoulder and goes...

00:25:51.701 --> 00:25:53.434
(whimpering)

00:25:53.467 --> 00:25:54.701
TRAVIS: No, that would
never hurt me.

00:25:54.734 --> 00:25:56.834
LIAM: I'm gonna walk up
to him as well,

00:25:56.868 --> 00:25:58.901
cause he looks
fucked up and say,

00:25:58.934 --> 00:26:00.467
"Hey, thank you for
the assist, Spanky."

00:26:00.501 --> 00:26:02.534
And I'm gonna give
him two slaps of the cheek

00:26:02.567 --> 00:26:04.267
and leave a couple of
black feathers stuck there

00:26:04.300 --> 00:26:07.300
with sweat and use the last
of my Lay on Hands on him.

00:26:07.334 --> 00:26:10.067
TALIESIN: Now that-- now that we've
sent the word, maybe now--

00:26:10.100 --> 00:26:11.634
(indistinct talking)

00:26:11.667 --> 00:26:13.467
The conversation's
underground.

00:26:13.501 --> 00:26:14.767
MARISHA: Okay.

00:26:14.801 --> 00:26:16.868
LIAM: Everything hurts.

00:26:16.901 --> 00:26:19.767
MATT: What's your
armor class?

00:26:19.801 --> 00:26:21.801
LIAM: Twenty-one.

00:26:21.834 --> 00:26:24.934
MATT: He knees you gently
enough in the nuts

00:26:24.968 --> 00:26:26.467
to get you to
drop to one knee.

00:26:26.501 --> 00:26:27.801
TRAVIS: "Gently enough."

00:26:27.834 --> 00:26:29.033
MATT: "That's two."

00:26:29.067 --> 00:26:31.534
(laughter)

00:26:31.567 --> 00:26:32.567
TRAVIS: Yes, good
throwback!

00:26:32.601 --> 00:26:35.501
LIAM: I laugh through it.

00:26:35.534 --> 00:26:36.534
TRAVIS: Good callback.

00:26:36.567 --> 00:26:37.534
TALIESIN: Are there-- are
there any soldiers

00:26:37.567 --> 00:26:38.534
running around
by the way?

00:26:38.567 --> 00:26:39.834
Right now, any
of our people?

00:26:39.868 --> 00:26:41.334
MATT: Right now, some soldiers
are beginning to pour in

00:26:41.367 --> 00:26:43.300
through the gate
that they emerged from.

00:26:43.334 --> 00:26:45.314
Some of your allies,
some from other armies

00:26:45.314 --> 00:26:46.868
that are starting
to find their way

00:26:46.901 --> 00:26:48.750
towards the center
core of the city.

00:26:48.750 --> 00:26:51.601
Not everyone's been
made aware that the--

00:26:51.634 --> 00:26:53.601
the center of this battle

00:26:53.634 --> 00:26:57.367
has already been
won, essentially.

00:26:57.400 --> 00:26:58.400
TRAVIS: Damn it.

00:26:58.434 --> 00:27:00.300
MATT: So, people are
starting to come in

00:27:00.334 --> 00:27:01.501
and calm down a bit
and then rush back out

00:27:01.534 --> 00:27:02.868
to see what else is there.

00:27:02.901 --> 00:27:04.734
You watch as a few wyvern riders
try and scoot through the sky

00:27:04.767 --> 00:27:06.961
to catch up with the rest of
them as a bolt of lightning...

00:27:06.961 --> 00:27:08.467
Slams into one
and you see it...

00:27:08.501 --> 00:27:09.501
(yells)

00:27:09.534 --> 00:27:11.534
Streak and tumble
and then crash somewhere

00:27:11.567 --> 00:27:14.191
on the outside
of the district.

00:27:14.191 --> 00:27:16.167
TALIESIN: I'm gonna fire a couple
of times into the air

00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:17.834
just to get some
attention and just,

00:27:17.868 --> 00:27:20.601
"Spread the word,
Thordak has fallen!

00:27:20.634 --> 00:27:21.901
Spread the word!"

00:27:21.934 --> 00:27:23.381
Now, we can go down.

00:27:23.381 --> 00:27:25.234
MATT: You see some of the
soldiers immediately

00:27:25.267 --> 00:27:26.767
kind of look at each other
and you can hear the--

00:27:26.801 --> 00:27:28.534
sound of the shouting and
whispering back and forth.

00:27:28.567 --> 00:27:32.300
Voices are shouting, "Thordak
has fallen! Thordak has fallen!

00:27:32.334 --> 00:27:33.968
Thordak has fallen!"

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:36.834
It starts just carrying
throughout the city and echoing.

00:27:36.868 --> 00:27:39.267
MARISHA: Call the locksmith!

00:27:39.300 --> 00:27:40.501
MATT: Everyone goes, "What?"

00:27:40.534 --> 00:27:42.267
"Sorry, Thordak has fallen!"

00:27:42.267 --> 00:27:44.137
(laughter)

00:27:46.334 --> 00:27:48.960
So, as you--
you follow them

00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:50.901
and gather into the
area, or you want to--

00:27:50.934 --> 00:27:54.200
PATRICK: I'd say, just as--
and I have to go talk.

00:27:54.234 --> 00:27:56.968
I'm like,
"Samantha, it's you.

00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:58.367
Circle everyone up.

00:27:58.400 --> 00:28:00.400
Make sure the people
are taken care of."

00:28:00.434 --> 00:28:02.334
MATT: "Yes."

00:28:02.367 --> 00:28:05.300
PATRICK: And it's just
like, 30--

00:28:05.334 --> 00:28:07.501
SAM: Another campaign going on.

00:28:07.534 --> 00:28:10.901
lots of campaigns have
just briefly touched.

00:28:10.934 --> 00:28:13.901
PATRICK: It's a couple--
a couple dozen

00:28:13.934 --> 00:28:17.267
moderately well armored,

00:28:17.300 --> 00:28:20.400
but you know, like...

00:28:20.434 --> 00:28:22.367
These-- these are not
maybe crack troops.

00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:24.567
They have a
lot of heart.

00:28:24.601 --> 00:28:27.200
LIAM: Do they have
any hit points?

00:28:27.234 --> 00:28:30.968
PATRICK: More than you
might expect.

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:33.067
Yeah, and so I just,
I square them away.

00:28:33.100 --> 00:28:34.868
They can take care
of themselves by now,

00:28:34.901 --> 00:28:36.667
at least for a bit.

00:28:36.701 --> 00:28:38.300
MATT: Yeah, they set
up a small perimeter

00:28:38.334 --> 00:28:40.367
to the entrance ways
to the district

00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:43.868
and are awaiting
other forces to arrive

00:28:43.901 --> 00:28:45.267
and inform them
of what's going on

00:28:45.300 --> 00:28:47.534
and still stay alert for any
stragglers of the battle.

00:28:47.567 --> 00:28:49.491
LIAM: What a world,
what a world.

00:28:50.634 --> 00:28:52.701
MATT: As you--
What'd you do?

00:28:52.734 --> 00:28:56.267
MARISHA: I just-- I grab Kerr and I start
ushering him down into the hole.

00:28:56.300 --> 00:28:57.868
PATRICK: Okay.

00:28:57.901 --> 00:29:00.434
MARISHA: Into the hole!

00:29:00.467 --> 00:29:01.734
MATT: Laura.

00:29:01.767 --> 00:29:03.167
LAURA: I'm so sorry!

00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:06.434
MATT: You are-- you're my
favorite 13 year old.

00:29:06.467 --> 00:29:08.734
PATRICK: It's-- it's
a lovely hole.

00:29:08.767 --> 00:29:11.067
(laughter)

00:29:11.100 --> 00:29:13.133
-LIAM: That's what they tell me.
-MATT: There's room for everyone.

00:29:13.167 --> 00:29:16.434
PATRICK: It's been a long
time for me, you know.

00:29:16.467 --> 00:29:17.901
I haven't done
this recently.

00:29:17.934 --> 00:29:20.367
LIAM: I'm in here
all the time.

00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:22.234
All the time.

00:29:22.267 --> 00:29:25.267
MATT: While this is
happening, Scanlan,

00:29:25.300 --> 00:29:28.367
you stayed down there
with Kima and Gilmore.

00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:31.767
SAM: Yeah, I sort of moseyed my
way back to the beginning--

00:29:31.801 --> 00:29:33.601
to the opening
of the lair,

00:29:33.634 --> 00:29:35.400
like, where I had
tossed the flute.

00:29:35.434 --> 00:29:36.434
MATT: Yeah.

00:29:36.467 --> 00:29:37.868
LIAM: And I pick it up,

00:29:37.901 --> 00:29:40.634
and I carefully divide

00:29:40.667 --> 00:29:44.000
my sachet of Suude
into three parts.

00:29:44.033 --> 00:29:47.834
Three thirds.

00:29:47.868 --> 00:29:51.100
And I'm going to
snort one third of it.

00:29:51.133 --> 00:29:53.100
MATT: Okay.

00:29:53.133 --> 00:29:55.834
The large brass dragon
that has currently

00:29:55.868 --> 00:29:58.434
-been heading at the end--
-SAM: He can watch.

00:29:58.467 --> 00:30:00.777
They can watch, they
can watch, they can watch.

00:30:00.777 --> 00:30:04.467
MATT: At the end of the
tunnel, Devo'ssa,

00:30:04.501 --> 00:30:08.164
they've slowly brought down
to their hands and knees

00:30:08.164 --> 00:30:10.033
after travelling through
and scoping out

00:30:10.067 --> 00:30:13.534
the interior
of the lair.

00:30:13.567 --> 00:30:16.234
Approaches you as you're pulling
out your stash and you know,

00:30:16.267 --> 00:30:19.100
Gilmore and Kima
approaching as well.

00:30:19.133 --> 00:30:22.133
"What have you there?"

00:30:22.167 --> 00:30:24.801
SAM: I've had a...

00:30:24.834 --> 00:30:27.767
Not a great
day, Devo'ssa.

00:30:29.968 --> 00:30:31.934
Thank you for coming.

00:30:31.968 --> 00:30:34.334
For answering our call.

00:30:34.367 --> 00:30:37.801
I just need a second to
myself if you don't mind.

00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:41.567
LAURA: Isn't Pike
still down there?

00:30:41.601 --> 00:30:44.471
MATT: Technically, Pike would
still be down there with him.

00:30:45.834 --> 00:30:48.868
SAM: Maybe just
turn a wing?

00:30:48.901 --> 00:30:51.334
(laughter)

00:30:56.334 --> 00:30:57.701
MATT: They give a
curious glance

00:30:57.734 --> 00:31:00.458
as Gilmore
kind of walks up

00:31:00.458 --> 00:31:01.954
and brushes
his hair back,

00:31:01.954 --> 00:31:03.767
which it catches
your eye interestingly.

00:31:03.801 --> 00:31:05.804
There is like a glowing
rune of some kind

00:31:05.804 --> 00:31:07.701
in the center of
Gilmore's forehead.

00:31:07.734 --> 00:31:10.434
He kind of brushes the hair
out of the way and he goes,

00:31:10.467 --> 00:31:13.634
"If a man wants some privacy,
give him some privacy.

00:31:13.667 --> 00:31:15.434
I just want to ask
you a few questions.

00:31:15.467 --> 00:31:19.167
It's not very often
I get to talk to...

00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:20.601
J'Mon."

00:31:21.834 --> 00:31:26.801
And Gilmore walks up
as the dragon sits back up

00:31:26.834 --> 00:31:30.801
and puts out a claw and kind
of lifts Gilmore into his claw.

00:31:30.834 --> 00:31:33.200
They both begin having a
conversation back and forth,

00:31:33.234 --> 00:31:35.054
which, at this point
Pike is also curious

00:31:35.054 --> 00:31:36.400
and begins to
pay attention

00:31:36.434 --> 00:31:37.634
and sidles
up next to you

00:31:37.667 --> 00:31:39.234
as you begin
divvying out and goes--

00:31:39.267 --> 00:31:40.760
SAM: Are they talking
in their language,

00:31:40.760 --> 00:31:42.334
the Marquet
language or--

00:31:42.367 --> 00:31:43.930
MATT: If you want
to listen in--

00:31:43.930 --> 00:31:46.167
SAM: No, no, I'm just curious.

00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:48.834
MATT: Marquesian, and
yes, they are.

00:31:48.868 --> 00:31:51.534
-SAM: Exciting.
-TALIESIN: I don't speak that.

00:31:51.567 --> 00:31:54.901
MATT: As you begin
taking it out

00:31:54.934 --> 00:31:57.467
and you're getting ready to go
ahead and snort one portion.

00:31:57.501 --> 00:31:58.601
SAM: One third.

00:31:58.634 --> 00:32:01.047
MATT: One third of
your Suude.

00:32:01.701 --> 00:32:03.167
Pike approaches
from behind

00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:05.868
and claps her gauntlet
onto your shoulder and says,

00:32:05.901 --> 00:32:07.834
"Scanlan, you okay?"

00:32:07.868 --> 00:32:10.000
SAM: Oh, yeah, I just--

00:32:10.033 --> 00:32:14.601
This is some, some
healing herbs that I got.

00:32:14.634 --> 00:32:19.000
MATT: "Okay, well, if I--
I'm trained in--

00:32:19.033 --> 00:32:22.037
in medicinal applications
if you need my help."

00:32:23.701 --> 00:32:25.000
(laughter)

00:32:25.033 --> 00:32:26.234
SAM: I put it away.

00:32:26.267 --> 00:32:28.901
(laughter)

00:32:28.934 --> 00:32:31.064
TRAVIS: Pike cures all.

00:32:32.667 --> 00:32:34.988
MATT: She looks over towards Kima

00:32:34.988 --> 00:32:37.400
and Kima is now
approaching the rest of you guys

00:32:37.434 --> 00:32:39.000
and walking into the lair

00:32:39.033 --> 00:32:40.901
and they're feeling
out the vicinity

00:32:40.934 --> 00:32:43.901
to see if the lair actions
have come to a halt,

00:32:43.934 --> 00:32:46.053
and made it safe.

00:32:47.067 --> 00:32:49.133
And so Pike begins
shouting out orders, like,

00:32:49.167 --> 00:32:50.634
"Alright, we have
to make a perimeter!

00:32:50.667 --> 00:32:51.701
Make sure there's
no other exits!

00:32:51.734 --> 00:32:52.868
Make sure there's no--

00:32:52.901 --> 00:32:56.017
nothing else waiting
for us in this cavern!

00:32:56.017 --> 00:32:57.467
I'm giving
orders to a dragon.

00:32:57.501 --> 00:32:58.968
You, dragon!

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:01.513
Help us do a
perimeter, please!"

00:33:01.513 --> 00:33:03.367
And kind of interrupting
the conversation

00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:07.734
between Devo'ssa
and Gilmore.

00:33:07.767 --> 00:33:10.334
The brass dragon
turns the head down.

00:33:10.367 --> 00:33:13.601
"Well, if you
insist, small one."

00:33:13.634 --> 00:33:15.200
And sets Gilmore back down

00:33:15.234 --> 00:33:19.133
onto the center of
the lair floor and...

00:33:19.167 --> 00:33:21.367
They just begin
to walk perimeter

00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:24.701
as Pike joins up and you are
still left alone in the tunnel,

00:33:24.734 --> 00:33:26.000
should you be so inclined.

00:33:26.033 --> 00:33:27.827
SAM: Alright, I'll
whip it out again.

00:33:27.827 --> 00:33:29.467
(laughter)

00:33:29.501 --> 00:33:31.907
MATT: Make an intelligence
check if you don't mind.

00:33:31.907 --> 00:33:33.234
Just add your
intelligence.

00:33:33.267 --> 00:33:35.501
-SAM: Oh, not good.
-TALIESIN: Wow.

00:33:35.534 --> 00:33:37.294
LAURA: You're gonna put
it in your butt.

00:33:37.294 --> 00:33:38.400
(laughter)

00:33:38.434 --> 00:33:41.334
-SAM: Six!
-MATT: Six!

00:33:41.367 --> 00:33:42.954
TRAVIS: Six total?

00:33:44.367 --> 00:33:45.934
MATT: Okay.

00:33:46.567 --> 00:33:48.868
This looks exactly like
the kind of substance

00:33:48.901 --> 00:33:51.267
you should be
snorting for use.

00:33:51.300 --> 00:33:55.467
So, you-- you take a bit
of the Suude, and this--

00:33:55.501 --> 00:33:59.267
this particular Suude,
taking a closer look at it,

00:33:59.300 --> 00:34:00.400
the grains of it,
and it's like--

00:34:00.434 --> 00:34:02.033
almost like a--

00:34:02.067 --> 00:34:04.300
like a brown sugar
type texture to it.

00:34:04.334 --> 00:34:06.200
It is a dark
brown color to it.

00:34:06.234 --> 00:34:07.901
It looks like a
crystallized dirt almost

00:34:07.934 --> 00:34:09.868
and you kind of like take--
take a second, look around.

00:34:09.900 --> 00:34:11.833
(sniffs)

00:34:11.868 --> 00:34:13.400
It burns!

00:34:13.434 --> 00:34:15.567
It burns.

00:34:15.601 --> 00:34:17.801
Oh, man,
does it burn!

00:34:21.100 --> 00:34:22.701
It burns a lot,
and you're like...

00:34:22.734 --> 00:34:24.434
(groaning)

00:34:24.467 --> 00:34:26.077
SAM: No effect?

00:34:27.601 --> 00:34:29.967
MATT: It burns,
that's an effect.

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:31.467
SAM: Okay.

00:34:31.501 --> 00:34:33.601
I take out
the flute.

00:34:33.634 --> 00:34:35.427
I pack some in
the front of it.

00:34:35.427 --> 00:34:37.177
(laughter)

00:34:37.177 --> 00:34:39.067
MATT: This is how you
treat relics

00:34:39.100 --> 00:34:42.501
that were gifted to you by the
leader of a foreign nation

00:34:42.534 --> 00:34:45.567
by turning the expended energy
into a makeshift pipe.

00:34:45.601 --> 00:34:47.167
SAM: I'm taking another third

00:34:47.199 --> 00:34:49.132
and I'm packing it in
the front of the flute.

00:34:49.167 --> 00:34:50.869
TRAVIS: Oh, please let it be--

00:34:50.869 --> 00:34:52.766
(talking over each other)

00:34:52.801 --> 00:34:54.367
Free basing, so!

00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:58.868
(talking over each other)

00:34:58.901 --> 00:35:02.834
SAM: I will dip a torch into
a bit of lava to light it.

00:35:02.868 --> 00:35:05.501
(laughter)

00:35:05.534 --> 00:35:08.634
And I am going
to bong rip

00:35:08.667 --> 00:35:11.701
from this ancient
brass flute.

00:35:11.734 --> 00:35:13.868
(laughter)

00:35:13.901 --> 00:35:16.267
MATT: Alrighty.

00:35:16.300 --> 00:35:18.650
I need you to make a
constitution saving throw.

00:35:18.650 --> 00:35:20.000
LAURA: What are you doing?!

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:22.100
-SAM: Constitution saving--
-MATT: Constitution saving.

00:35:22.133 --> 00:35:25.400
-LAURA: Constitution saving throw!
-MATT: Constitution saving throw.

00:35:25.434 --> 00:35:26.467
SAM: Not good.

00:35:26.501 --> 00:35:28.467
(laughter)

00:35:28.501 --> 00:35:30.868
-Eight.
-MATT: Eight.

00:35:30.901 --> 00:35:32.634
Roll 1d4.

00:35:32.667 --> 00:35:36.133
SAM: Here we go,
here we go.

00:35:36.167 --> 00:35:38.200
Three.

00:35:38.234 --> 00:35:40.167
MATT: As you inhale deeply,

00:35:40.200 --> 00:35:42.001
as opposed to the
burning sensation

00:35:42.001 --> 00:35:44.334
from when you decided
to snort the granules,

00:35:44.367 --> 00:35:47.534
the smoke and
mist that emerges

00:35:47.567 --> 00:35:49.868
as it fills your
lungs, actually has a--

00:35:49.901 --> 00:35:54.334
a very fine herbal taste
to it almost and it is warm,

00:35:54.367 --> 00:35:56.834
and there's a head rush
immediately that hits you.

00:35:56.868 --> 00:35:58.634
You feel for a moment your
vision kind of crystallize

00:35:58.667 --> 00:36:00.208
and clarify
all of a sudden.

00:36:00.208 --> 00:36:03.434
All the colors become
briefly brighter

00:36:03.467 --> 00:36:07.111
and you feel this
slight pulse of--

00:36:07.111 --> 00:36:08.914
of energy whenever
you cast a spell,

00:36:08.914 --> 00:36:10.634
like the fingers
kind of warm at the tips

00:36:10.667 --> 00:36:12.634
and you
feel the immediate need

00:36:12.667 --> 00:36:15.801
to just practice something.

00:36:15.834 --> 00:36:19.801
Right before your vision
gets blurry, and dark.

00:36:21.300 --> 00:36:22.720
As--

00:36:25.334 --> 00:36:28.300
Yeah, that's it,
the rest of you guys--

00:36:28.334 --> 00:36:31.834
The rest of you guys come
walking down the tunnel,

00:36:31.868 --> 00:36:33.000
being careful,
you know,

00:36:33.033 --> 00:36:34.534
weapons out,
but talking,

00:36:34.567 --> 00:36:37.000
kind of getting up to speed
with what's transpired.

00:36:37.033 --> 00:36:39.237
You look in the distance and
you can see within the lair

00:36:39.237 --> 00:36:41.434
and you're seeing
this, it's a down--

00:36:41.434 --> 00:36:45.100
A decline into this
large heavy tunnel

00:36:45.133 --> 00:36:48.167
that is just made
of volcanic rock

00:36:48.200 --> 00:36:51.133
and blackened stone with
occasional cracks of--

00:36:51.167 --> 00:36:53.167
of melting rock that
are just spilling through

00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:56.000
and these small
orange glowing pockets

00:36:56.033 --> 00:36:58.100
into this large central
underground cavern

00:36:58.133 --> 00:37:01.000
that has an entire
pool of molten rock

00:37:01.033 --> 00:37:03.567
that is kind of spiraling
through portions of the floor.

00:37:03.601 --> 00:37:05.734
There is a large
brass dragon

00:37:05.767 --> 00:37:08.400
just casually strolling
around the opposite side.

00:37:08.434 --> 00:37:12.167
Huge, gargantuan in
size, strolling around

00:37:12.200 --> 00:37:14.434
and a few other
humanoid individuals,

00:37:14.467 --> 00:37:19.300
and you guys watch as
a singular male gnome ally

00:37:19.334 --> 00:37:22.004
is face down on
the ground not moving.

00:37:22.004 --> 00:37:24.217
TRAVIS: Oh, there was
no one even in here!

00:37:24.217 --> 00:37:25.667
LAURA: Can I run up to him?

00:37:25.701 --> 00:37:28.204
-MATT: Yeah.
-LAURA: Scanlan?

00:37:29.367 --> 00:37:32.067
Smack him a couple times,
does he wake up?

00:37:32.100 --> 00:37:33.601
MATT: Nope.

00:37:33.634 --> 00:37:34.667
LAURA: Can I roll him over?

00:37:34.701 --> 00:37:36.167
PATRICK: Probably get over
there pretty quick too.

00:37:36.200 --> 00:37:37.634
It's not that I don't
think that these guys

00:37:37.667 --> 00:37:39.067
can take of their
own wounded, but--

00:37:39.100 --> 00:37:40.434
-MATT: Yeah.
-PATRICK: Yeah.

00:37:40.467 --> 00:37:43.133
MATT: So, you rush up and
have both of you

00:37:43.167 --> 00:37:45.434
make a medicine
check right now.

00:37:45.467 --> 00:37:48.501
LAURA: Oh my God.

00:37:48.534 --> 00:37:49.767
SAM: This is everything.

00:37:49.801 --> 00:37:51.868
(laughter)

00:37:51.901 --> 00:37:53.901
MARISHA: Great time for
a personal crisis.

00:37:53.934 --> 00:37:55.634
Great timing!

00:37:55.667 --> 00:37:58.901
LIAM: ♪ I'll do anything
for Suude ♪♪

00:37:58.934 --> 00:38:01.324
-LAURA: Only eight.
-TALIESIN: That's the end of his turn.

00:38:01.324 --> 00:38:02.801
MARISHA: Yes, that was his turn.

00:38:02.834 --> 00:38:04.200
-Yeah.
-TALIESIN: Fair.

00:38:04.234 --> 00:38:07.567
LAURA: But I've got a Cure Wounds
potion I can--

00:38:07.601 --> 00:38:09.300
a Cure Wounds
spell I can use.

00:38:09.334 --> 00:38:11.070
MATT: But what'd you roll
your medicine check?

00:38:11.070 --> 00:38:13.200
-LAURA: Eight.
-MATT: Eight.

00:38:13.234 --> 00:38:15.734
PATRICK: Not great, like,
is he gushing blood?

00:38:15.767 --> 00:38:18.434
MATT: No, there is no blood
from his wounds.

00:38:18.467 --> 00:38:21.734
PATRICK: (sniffing)

00:38:21.767 --> 00:38:23.200
Do I know what
that smell is?

00:38:23.234 --> 00:38:25.467
MATT: What'd you roll for
your medicine check?

00:38:25.501 --> 00:38:27.267
PATRICK: Not worth speaking of.
Like 6.

00:38:27.267 --> 00:38:28.567
MATT: Okay, okay.

00:38:28.601 --> 00:38:30.334
So you're not sure
exactly what happened.

00:38:30.367 --> 00:38:33.467
You do smell this
strange kind of herbal,

00:38:33.501 --> 00:38:35.754
almost like an
incense scent

00:38:35.754 --> 00:38:37.300
that is centered
around his area

00:38:37.334 --> 00:38:39.024
and he is breathing.

00:38:39.024 --> 00:38:40.387
But he is not conscious.

00:38:40.387 --> 00:38:42.234
-LIAM: Pike!
-PATRICK: Can I check for poison?

00:38:42.267 --> 00:38:45.767
LAURA: Can I do a nature check to
see if I recognize the scent?

00:38:45.767 --> 00:38:47.634
MATT: Sure, make a nature check.

00:38:47.667 --> 00:38:49.967
LAURA: I'm gonna cast Cure Wounds
on him, just to try it.

00:38:49.967 --> 00:38:52.117
LIAM: And I'm just shouting
out Pike's name.

00:38:52.117 --> 00:38:53.968
MARISHA: Ooh, I rolled
a natural 19.

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:57.533
-MATT: Okay.
-MARISHA: So that's 29-- no 30 total.

00:38:57.533 --> 00:39:00.597
MATT: Okay, best that you can make,
strangely enough, there's--

00:39:00.597 --> 00:39:03.934
the scent is
medicinal almost,

00:39:03.968 --> 00:39:06.363
but it's also synthetic
in a way that's not natural.

00:39:06.363 --> 00:39:08.300
This-- whatever
this smell is,

00:39:08.334 --> 00:39:10.244
it's not a natural incense.

00:39:10.244 --> 00:39:11.850
SAM: PCP.

00:39:13.334 --> 00:39:14.567
It was laced.

00:39:14.601 --> 00:39:17.111
TRAVIS: Anyone check to see if
the pipe's still packed?

00:39:17.111 --> 00:39:20.834
MARISHA: Yeah, are there any
signs around Scanlan as--

00:39:20.868 --> 00:39:22.200
MATT: Well, yeah, there is--

00:39:22.234 --> 00:39:26.300
There is
the tarnished brass flute

00:39:26.334 --> 00:39:29.434
that was gifted
to him by the leader

00:39:29.467 --> 00:39:31.400
of the foreign city
of Ank'Harel

00:39:31.434 --> 00:39:33.901
that is currently tarnished
by the use of its magic

00:39:33.934 --> 00:39:36.701
and it is jammed pack with a
black ashy crystalline substance

00:39:36.734 --> 00:39:38.434
with a trail of smoke

00:39:38.467 --> 00:39:41.133
that is kind of lazily
drizzling off the tip.

00:39:41.167 --> 00:39:43.634
TRAVIS: What did J'Mon do to him?

00:39:43.667 --> 00:39:46.200
(laughter)

00:39:49.434 --> 00:39:52.601
LAURA: Well, regardless of what's going
on, you healed 13 points.

00:39:52.634 --> 00:39:54.244
SAM: Oh, that's nice.

00:39:54.244 --> 00:39:57.167
MARISHA: Okay, I pick up the pipe,
since I recognize what--

00:39:57.200 --> 00:39:59.534
that's where the
scent is coming from.

00:39:59.567 --> 00:40:04.367
Can I like, do an investigation
check or something?

00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:07.267
LAURA: Can I smack him across
the face as hard as I can?

00:40:07.300 --> 00:40:09.133
-MATT: You can.
-LAURA: Even though I just healed him.

00:40:09.167 --> 00:40:10.868
MARISHA: If I can put together
what's going on.

00:40:10.901 --> 00:40:13.100
PATRICK: This obviously-- if
he's not gushing blood.

00:40:13.133 --> 00:40:14.734
Some sort of
poison going on.

00:40:14.767 --> 00:40:15.901
MATT: Okay, so-- so--

00:40:15.934 --> 00:40:17.901
SAM: Am I having any sort
of dream, Matt?

00:40:17.934 --> 00:40:20.868
MATT: No, darkness.

00:40:20.901 --> 00:40:22.400
TRAVIS: Darkness.

00:40:22.434 --> 00:40:24.501
MATT: You utilize Detect Poison
and you don't--

00:40:24.534 --> 00:40:28.234
you don't sense anything
that is clarified toxin

00:40:28.267 --> 00:40:30.801
to the point where it would
register as a poison,

00:40:30.834 --> 00:40:32.367
so at least,
you're calm--

00:40:32.400 --> 00:40:33.868
you're calmed
to know that

00:40:33.901 --> 00:40:35.968
there isn't something coursing
through his system right now

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:37.267
that is in danger
of killing him.

00:40:37.300 --> 00:40:39.400
-PATRICK: Okay.
-MARISHA: Fifteen.

00:40:39.434 --> 00:40:41.767
-MATT: Fifteen on investigation?
-MARISHA: Yeah.

00:40:41.801 --> 00:40:43.767
MATT: Yeah, he smoked
something out of this.

00:40:43.801 --> 00:40:46.847
(laughter)

00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:51.167
MARISHA: Guys.

00:40:51.200 --> 00:40:54.423
I feel like this was
a classic Scanlan.

00:40:56.067 --> 00:40:59.033
In terms of choices, I don't
think anyone did this.

00:40:59.067 --> 00:41:01.300
LAURA: I don't understand.

00:41:01.334 --> 00:41:04.200
MARISHA: I'm gonna start kind
of, like, like kinda,

00:41:04.234 --> 00:41:07.334
can I start seeing if I can find
whatever he put in this pipe?

00:41:07.367 --> 00:41:08.567
MATT: Make an investigation check

00:41:08.601 --> 00:41:11.534
as you start rummaging
through his stuff.

00:41:11.567 --> 00:41:12.801
MARISHA: Eleven.

00:41:12.834 --> 00:41:14.534
MATT: Alright, you're pulling
through pockets.

00:41:14.567 --> 00:41:16.801
He has a lot more pockets
than you'd expect.

00:41:16.834 --> 00:41:18.200
LAURA: Can I do investigation check?

00:41:18.234 --> 00:41:21.067
Cause I'm good at hiding
things on my person.

00:41:21.100 --> 00:41:23.634
MARISHA: Hey, Vex--
Vex, look.

00:41:23.667 --> 00:41:25.334
I-- I think he
did something.

00:41:25.367 --> 00:41:27.334
I think he--
he tried something.

00:41:27.367 --> 00:41:29.133
Look and see if you
can find what might be--

00:41:29.167 --> 00:41:30.934
what he might have
put in this pipe.

00:41:30.968 --> 00:41:33.024
MATT: So they're starting to go
the rest of his pockets.

00:41:33.024 --> 00:41:34.567
Make an investigation check.

00:41:34.601 --> 00:41:37.187
What'd you get here, Vex?

00:41:37.801 --> 00:41:40.901
LAURA: Goddammit, I'm
rolling like shit!

00:41:41.934 --> 00:41:43.367
Ten.

00:41:43.400 --> 00:41:45.121
MATT: Okay, you both
start pulling

00:41:45.121 --> 00:41:47.367
through the pockets
before Scanlan--

00:41:47.400 --> 00:41:50.667
SAM: I have a porn book
that they might find.

00:41:50.701 --> 00:41:54.000
MATT: And you do, you find a fantastic
small pocket sized tome

00:41:54.033 --> 00:41:57.367
that manages to contain
a lot of very, very detailed

00:41:57.400 --> 00:41:59.734
pieces of artwork about
male and female anatomy.

00:41:59.767 --> 00:42:01.834
TRAVIS: I'll take that.

00:42:01.868 --> 00:42:04.267
MARISHA: I take the pipe.

00:42:04.300 --> 00:42:07.200
Sorry, the flute.

00:42:07.234 --> 00:42:10.501
MATT: You also, you watch
as Scanlan begins to shift

00:42:10.534 --> 00:42:12.467
and his eyes begin to
flutter open and you--

00:42:12.501 --> 00:42:15.167
you come back to consciousness
with a mild headache

00:42:15.200 --> 00:42:17.200
with all of your
friends gathered around

00:42:17.234 --> 00:42:19.868
and Keyleth and Vax with
their hands in your pockets.

00:42:19.901 --> 00:42:21.067
LAURA: I'm Vex, hi.

00:42:21.100 --> 00:42:22.133
-MATT: Vex.
-LAURA: Hi.

00:42:22.167 --> 00:42:24.000
SAM: Get your hands
out of my pockets.

00:42:24.033 --> 00:42:26.067
LAURA: What the fuck
did you do?

00:42:26.100 --> 00:42:27.761
SAM: Wait, first.

00:42:28.534 --> 00:42:29.667
Are you real?

00:42:29.701 --> 00:42:31.367
(laughter)

00:42:31.400 --> 00:42:33.001
TALIESIN: No.

00:42:33.734 --> 00:42:35.033
SAM: Is this a hallucination?

00:42:35.067 --> 00:42:36.534
-TRAVIS: Yep.
-TALIESIN: Yes.

00:42:36.567 --> 00:42:38.133
MARISHA: Scanlan, why
would you be asking

00:42:38.167 --> 00:42:39.901
if this is a
hallucination?

00:42:39.934 --> 00:42:41.033
Just curious.

00:42:41.067 --> 00:42:42.980
SAM: We've had a
very rough day.

00:42:42.980 --> 00:42:45.234
How do I feel, Matt?

00:42:45.267 --> 00:42:48.204
MATT: I mean, you feel
like there was--

00:42:49.567 --> 00:42:51.634
there was something
to the rush,

00:42:51.667 --> 00:42:53.267
but your body
rejected it.

00:42:53.300 --> 00:42:55.634
SAM: Rejected it.

00:42:55.667 --> 00:42:57.434
-Hmm, interesting.
-MARISHA: Huh.

00:42:57.467 --> 00:42:58.567
TRAVIS: Are you tired?

00:42:58.601 --> 00:43:00.501
You were asleep
when we found you.

00:43:00.534 --> 00:43:03.067
LAURA: Face down.

00:43:03.100 --> 00:43:06.033
SAM: I was shaken
by today's events

00:43:06.067 --> 00:43:08.300
and there was a lair action
that knocked me unconscious.

00:43:08.334 --> 00:43:10.467
-TRAVIS: Holy shit.
-LAURA: What's a lair action?

00:43:10.501 --> 00:43:15.000
SAM: I mean, there was
a trap set by Thordak

00:43:15.033 --> 00:43:18.534
previously to his death that
knocked me unconscious?

00:43:18.567 --> 00:43:20.634
LAURA: What's in this flute,
you piece of shit?

00:43:20.667 --> 00:43:21.901
What's in the flute?

00:43:21.934 --> 00:43:23.434
SAM: Herbs, give it to me!

00:43:23.467 --> 00:43:25.634
MARISHA: No, no, no.

00:43:25.667 --> 00:43:28.501
LAURA: No, you're too short,
you can't even reach.

00:43:28.534 --> 00:43:29.640
MARISHA: I'm too--

00:43:31.434 --> 00:43:32.567
TALIESIN: Angry T-Rex.

00:43:32.601 --> 00:43:34.594
MARISHA: Can I do an
insight check on him?

00:43:34.594 --> 00:43:35.934
MATT: Sure.

00:43:35.968 --> 00:43:38.367
Scanlan, make a
deception check.

00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:39.400
SAM: Thirty-two.

00:43:39.434 --> 00:43:43.100
(laughter)

00:43:43.133 --> 00:43:44.100
MATT: What'd you get,
Keyleth?

00:43:44.133 --> 00:43:45.901
MARISHA: Twenty-two.

00:43:45.934 --> 00:43:49.367
MATT: Legitimately, like, aw,
I guess a misunderstanding.

00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:52.767
SAM: I'm shaken,
guys, I'm sorry.

00:43:52.801 --> 00:43:54.267
I'm-- I'm not myself.

00:43:54.300 --> 00:43:55.801
TRAVIS: Was it like poison gas

00:43:55.834 --> 00:43:58.334
or like lava or did a
rock fall on your head?

00:43:58.367 --> 00:44:00.968
SAM: I appreciate your concern
but what the fuck, Vax?

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:05.033
Why did you just charge
in after Raishan like that?

00:44:05.067 --> 00:44:06.334
See how I did that?

00:44:06.367 --> 00:44:10.601
(laughter)

00:44:10.634 --> 00:44:12.568
TALIESIN: This is the
best thing ever.

00:44:13.901 --> 00:44:15.974
SAM: Next time, will
you please tell us?

00:44:15.974 --> 00:44:17.901
LAURA: There wasn't a lot
of time there, Scanlan.

00:44:17.934 --> 00:44:19.100
LIAM: She was casting.

00:44:19.133 --> 00:44:20.634
She was reaching
for whatever it is

00:44:20.667 --> 00:44:22.434
she's been angling
for for months.

00:44:22.467 --> 00:44:24.901
SAM: Well, you almost got me
fucking killed, alright?

00:44:24.934 --> 00:44:26.200
TRAVIS: Actually, you--
you did get killed.

00:44:26.234 --> 00:44:28.267
LAURA: You died, so did I.

00:44:28.300 --> 00:44:31.200
SAM: That's even worse
than almost being killed.

00:44:31.234 --> 00:44:33.167
LIAM: I reach out and I do
this thing to his eye.

00:44:33.200 --> 00:44:35.200
Like that (indistinguishable).

00:44:35.234 --> 00:44:37.901
What did you think we
were coming here to do?

00:44:37.934 --> 00:44:40.200
We're here to-- the
fucking world is on fire.

00:44:40.234 --> 00:44:41.367
SAM: Yeah, but we're
your backup.

00:44:41.400 --> 00:44:42.834
You don't go in
without your backup.

00:44:42.868 --> 00:44:45.033
You've done this so
many times at this point.

00:44:45.067 --> 00:44:46.601
You've got to wait
for your backup to go.

00:44:46.634 --> 00:44:47.701
-LIAM: I do--
-SAM: Listen!

00:44:47.734 --> 00:44:50.133
I will do anything
that you want me to do.

00:44:50.167 --> 00:44:54.367
I will kill Kerr right--
hi, Kerr, by the way.

00:44:54.400 --> 00:44:57.033
I will kill him dead right
now if you want me to.

00:44:57.067 --> 00:44:59.334
That's how much
you are my brother.

00:44:59.367 --> 00:45:01.734
You need to trust us and
tell us what you're doing.

00:45:01.767 --> 00:45:03.171
Kerr, no offense.

00:45:04.534 --> 00:45:06.734
PATRICK: None taken.

00:45:06.767 --> 00:45:09.868
LIAM: I hear what
you're saying.

00:45:09.901 --> 00:45:13.200
She was reaching
for whatever power

00:45:13.234 --> 00:45:15.701
she has been
working towards

00:45:15.734 --> 00:45:18.501
and I wasn't going
to freely let her take it,

00:45:18.534 --> 00:45:19.734
and you weren't there.

00:45:19.767 --> 00:45:22.501
Fate didn't place you there,

00:45:22.534 --> 00:45:26.000
and when we ran in that cave,
you were ten seconds behind me.

00:45:26.033 --> 00:45:28.148
SAM: I have little legs.

00:45:30.901 --> 00:45:32.257
LIAM: Listen.

00:45:33.701 --> 00:45:36.133
-We failed.
-SAM: I know.

00:45:36.167 --> 00:45:37.754
LIAM: Hard.

00:45:39.267 --> 00:45:43.067
It doesn't mean it
was wrong to try.

00:45:43.100 --> 00:45:45.834
SAM: That's true.

00:45:45.868 --> 00:45:47.734
Man, we really
did fail though.

00:45:47.767 --> 00:45:49.234
LIAM: If not now, when?

00:45:49.267 --> 00:45:50.501
If not us, who?

00:45:50.534 --> 00:45:53.734
♪

00:45:53.767 --> 00:45:57.567
LAURA: Well, it's not
now, so, when?

00:45:57.601 --> 00:45:59.767
MARISHA: And it is us, so.

00:45:59.801 --> 00:46:01.868
TALIESIN: And I'm not calling
this a failure.

00:46:01.901 --> 00:46:03.334
MARISHA: You're not calling
this a failure?

00:46:03.367 --> 00:46:04.734
TALIESIN: I'm not calling
this a failure.

00:46:04.767 --> 00:46:07.300
-SAM: Well, it is.
-TALIESIN: We bought time.

00:46:07.334 --> 00:46:08.434
-MARISHA: What?
-TALIESIN: What?

00:46:08.467 --> 00:46:10.033
TRAVIS: Yeah, we shit
the bed on that.

00:46:10.067 --> 00:46:11.300
It was a complete failure.

00:46:11.334 --> 00:46:13.200
-LAURA: Truly, here's the thing.
-TALIESIN: Two dragons!

00:46:13.234 --> 00:46:15.067
LAURA: If she had succeeded,

00:46:15.100 --> 00:46:16.467
if we hadn't attacked
her when we did,

00:46:16.501 --> 00:46:17.767
and she had
succeeded in

00:46:17.801 --> 00:46:19.901
whatever she's about
to do with Thordak,

00:46:19.934 --> 00:46:22.601
you know, we probably
would have had to fight

00:46:22.634 --> 00:46:25.267
a much more powerful
Raishan or Thordak again

00:46:25.300 --> 00:46:26.734
or whatever the fuck
she's doing.

00:46:26.767 --> 00:46:27.734
LIAM: We don't know
what it was.

00:46:27.767 --> 00:46:28.834
TRAVIS: Yep.

00:46:28.868 --> 00:46:29.968
LIAM: And I wasn't
about to stand back

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:31.868
and listen to her
Scooby Doo monologue.

00:46:31.901 --> 00:46:33.267
I wanted to put
an end to it.

00:46:33.300 --> 00:46:34.467
SAM: What's Scooby Doo, man?

00:46:34.501 --> 00:46:36.000
TRAVIS: Don't know, folk tale.

00:46:36.033 --> 00:46:38.033
LIAM: It's an island far away
in the next campaign.

00:46:38.067 --> 00:46:39.601
SAM: Listen, I get it, I know.

00:46:39.634 --> 00:46:42.834
I know why you acted
and I probably

00:46:42.868 --> 00:46:46.024
would have done the same
thing had I been closer,

00:46:46.024 --> 00:46:47.334
but just next time,

00:46:47.367 --> 00:46:49.601
give us some sort
of a heads up, alright?

00:46:49.634 --> 00:46:52.827
We have a code word
and everything.

00:46:52.827 --> 00:46:55.133
LIAM: HolyshitI'mthrowingthedagger.

00:46:55.167 --> 00:46:56.934
LAURA: Jenga, I think it's jenga.

00:46:56.968 --> 00:46:58.968
LIAM: It doesn't apply
to this situation.

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:00.467
I'm sorry, you
weren't there.

00:47:00.501 --> 00:47:02.067
She was moving.

00:47:02.100 --> 00:47:05.264
The only thing I regret
is that she got away.

00:55:40.367 --> 00:55:42.367
The teeth curl into a grin

00:55:42.400 --> 00:55:45.501
and the voice
kinda billows out,

00:55:45.534 --> 00:55:48.567
like, a slow rolling
landslide into your face

00:55:48.601 --> 00:55:50.534
with the warmth
of its breath.

00:55:50.567 --> 00:55:54.310
"Nah, keep it."

00:55:56.534 --> 00:55:57.534
MARISHA: J'Mon!

00:55:57.567 --> 00:55:58.567
MATT: And just steps
over and starts

00:55:58.601 --> 00:56:02.033
making its way
up the hall--

00:56:02.067 --> 00:56:05.200
the cavern
towards the district.

00:56:05.234 --> 00:56:09.000
MARISHA: Before you leave?

00:56:09.033 --> 00:56:13.334
If you were fighting
a green dragon

00:56:13.367 --> 00:56:16.234
named the Diseased Deceiver,

00:56:16.267 --> 00:56:20.334
who wanted ultimate
power over her domain,

00:56:20.367 --> 00:56:22.067
where would you start?

00:56:25.667 --> 00:56:27.701
MATT: "In my opinion,

00:56:27.734 --> 00:56:32.434
entities that are
this intelligent,

00:56:32.467 --> 00:56:34.167
you never want
to wait for them

00:56:34.200 --> 00:56:35.634
to fight on
their terms."

00:56:40.033 --> 00:56:44.267
-TRAVIS: Good answer.
-LIAM: Yeah.

00:56:44.300 --> 00:56:49.067
MATT: And the slow
rolling impacts

00:56:49.100 --> 00:56:50.801
of the dragon's feet

00:56:50.834 --> 00:56:54.300
grow quieter and quieter
before you hear eventually...

00:56:54.334 --> 00:56:55.767
The wings lifting
up and you see

00:56:55.801 --> 00:56:59.501
as a cloud of
smoke and ash

00:56:59.534 --> 00:57:01.434
kind of pulls forth
into the tunnel,

00:57:01.467 --> 00:57:05.000
showing the lift off
as you can only ascertain

00:57:05.033 --> 00:57:08.033
J'Mon Sa Ord,
leader of Ank'Harel,

00:57:08.067 --> 00:57:12.067
the brass dragon begins flight
back towards their home.

00:57:12.100 --> 00:57:15.434
LAURA: Oh, shit, did J'Mon
fly here that entire way?

00:57:15.467 --> 00:57:18.934
SAM: No, I don't
I don't think so.

00:57:18.968 --> 00:57:20.400
TRAVIS: Flash.

00:57:20.434 --> 00:57:21.400
SAM: Maybe.

00:57:21.434 --> 00:57:24.634
LAURA: I was joking,
I was joking.

00:57:24.667 --> 00:57:27.334
SAM: As terrible as
this day has been,

00:57:27.367 --> 00:57:30.367
there is some gold at
the end of the tunnel.

00:57:30.400 --> 00:57:34.534
TRAVIS: Which is probably
rigged to explode.

00:57:34.567 --> 00:57:37.634
TALIESIN: I think it's
probably-- well--

00:57:37.667 --> 00:57:38.801
SAM: Want to go
check it out?

00:57:38.834 --> 00:57:40.868
LAURA: Kind of feel like,
we should, you know--

00:57:40.901 --> 00:57:42.367
Heal up a bit.

00:57:42.400 --> 00:57:43.901
I've been here before.

00:57:43.934 --> 00:57:47.901
It didn't go so well.

00:57:47.934 --> 00:57:49.868
PATRICK: Yeah, how knocked
about are they?

00:57:49.901 --> 00:57:52.501
I mean, obviously, singes
and abrasions and--

00:57:52.534 --> 00:57:54.701
LAURA: Like really, really
knocked to shit.

00:57:54.734 --> 00:57:57.601
TRAVIS: Raise your hand if you have
less than 30 hit points.

00:57:57.634 --> 00:57:59.200
MARISHA: I'm at 30.

00:57:59.234 --> 00:58:01.267
PATRICK: I could probably take
out the whole group.

00:58:01.300 --> 00:58:06.200
(laughter)

00:58:06.234 --> 00:58:09.868
-TALIESIN: Wow, that would be--
-MATT: Plot twist!

00:58:09.901 --> 00:58:11.501
LAURA: Oh my God,
are you Raishan?

00:58:11.534 --> 00:58:15.033
LIAM: Rothfuss!

00:58:15.067 --> 00:58:19.734
PATRICK: I was sent here
by Acquisitions.

00:58:19.767 --> 00:58:21.434
MATT: Assassination mission.

00:58:21.467 --> 00:58:23.504
-I love it.
-PATRICK: You sons of bitches.

00:58:23.504 --> 00:58:24.901
(laughter)

00:58:24.934 --> 00:58:26.067
SAM: You befriended us!

00:58:26.100 --> 00:58:30.033
PATRICK: Next time you pay
your protection money.

00:58:30.067 --> 00:58:32.601
SAM: Just like us to do this,
we trust everybody!

00:58:32.634 --> 00:58:35.367
God, we're idiots!

00:58:35.400 --> 00:58:36.567
LAURA: Oh, shit.

00:58:36.601 --> 00:58:38.481
MATT: The last thing you
hear is the laughter

00:58:38.481 --> 00:58:41.200
of a one-armed man in
the distance echoing.

00:58:41.234 --> 00:58:43.534
LIAM: Clarota, Asum, Rothfuss.

00:58:43.567 --> 00:58:45.400
Never ends!

00:58:45.434 --> 00:58:47.300
PATRICK: But no, if
people are that--

00:58:47.334 --> 00:58:51.901
are that bad,
like, I'll--

00:58:51.934 --> 00:58:54.167
You know.

00:58:54.200 --> 00:58:55.400
How are you?

00:58:55.434 --> 00:58:57.467
You're obviously, like,
it's gonna be, like,

00:58:57.501 --> 00:58:59.701
are you like visibly
like knocked about?

00:58:59.734 --> 00:59:02.300
-LAURA: I mean she's--
-MARISHA: I kinda fell in a pit of lava.

00:59:02.334 --> 00:59:04.400
LAURA: She's basically black
cinder right now.

00:59:04.434 --> 00:59:06.167
PATRICK: Oh, really?

00:59:06.200 --> 00:59:07.934
-Okay.
-LAURA: She face planted into lava.

00:59:07.968 --> 00:59:09.767
LIAM: She's burned,
she's burned.

00:59:09.801 --> 00:59:13.300
PATRICK: I'm like, Do you really want to
go looking for gold right now?

00:59:13.334 --> 00:59:15.033
Because you--

00:59:15.067 --> 00:59:18.701
♪

00:59:18.734 --> 00:59:20.033
Would you like to come
over here and sit down?

00:59:20.067 --> 00:59:21.434
I can take a look at--

00:59:21.467 --> 00:59:23.467
TRAVIS: As they discuss, can I
just walk over to a pile of--

00:59:23.501 --> 00:59:25.367
LAURA: Kash, how low are
you on healing?

00:59:25.400 --> 00:59:27.701
Can you heal us?

00:59:27.734 --> 00:59:30.100
MATT: Kash and Zahra, who
just kind of sitting off

00:59:30.133 --> 00:59:33.033
of the edge of the cavern,
kind of taking a breather.

00:59:33.067 --> 00:59:37.300
"Um, well, I got a
little bit, I guess."

00:59:37.334 --> 00:59:40.534
Zahra, by the way,
is like healed to full.

00:59:40.567 --> 00:59:43.667
TRAVIS: Of course.

00:59:43.701 --> 00:59:45.501
MARISHA: Yeah, I just--

00:59:49.167 --> 00:59:52.100
Keyleth just
bursts into tears.

00:59:52.133 --> 00:59:54.133
She just start--

00:59:54.167 --> 00:59:56.734
I'm so tired!

00:59:56.767 --> 00:59:59.167
I'm so tired.

00:59:59.200 --> 01:00:01.367
PATRICK: I'll kinda just kinda
usher her off a little bit

01:00:01.400 --> 01:00:07.300
wherever, like, is a little less
in the middle of everything.

01:00:07.334 --> 01:00:08.868
And I've got
my little pack

01:00:08.901 --> 01:00:10.400
and we can lay
it on the blanket.

01:00:10.434 --> 01:00:13.300
And she needs to get
some of these charred,

01:00:13.334 --> 01:00:15.601
smoldering clothes off of her.

01:00:15.634 --> 01:00:17.300
And so I can
look at these burns

01:00:17.334 --> 01:00:21.133
and start, um, you know...

01:00:21.167 --> 01:00:23.033
LAURA: I nudge Vax.

01:00:23.067 --> 01:00:28.434
I think that guy's puttin'
moves on your woman.

01:00:28.467 --> 01:00:32.367
-Okay.
-TRAVIS: Super worried.

01:00:32.400 --> 01:00:34.441
MARISHA: I do the same to Kerr,

01:00:34.441 --> 01:00:37.801
I just...my eyes.

01:00:37.834 --> 01:00:40.501
MATT: Kash kind of walks up and
slaps you on your shoulder,

01:00:40.534 --> 01:00:45.968
Vex, and kind of a jolt
and you heal 14 points.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:47.868
Cure wounds a little too,

01:00:47.901 --> 01:00:51.334
but as a bit of a
jolt through your body.

01:00:51.367 --> 01:00:53.601
LAURA: It's good, it's good.

01:00:53.634 --> 01:00:56.300
-Thank you.
-MATT: "You're welcome."

01:00:56.334 --> 01:00:59.167
He turns back around and
walks back to Zahra.

01:00:59.200 --> 01:01:01.501
PATRICK: And I just kind of
do the slow talk.

01:01:01.534 --> 01:01:03.067
You know, we're kind of like,

01:01:03.100 --> 01:01:04.868
it's like, oh,
this isn't as bad

01:01:04.901 --> 01:01:06.534
as it looks
at first, you know.

01:01:06.567 --> 01:01:08.300
And, 'cause this
was the old thing

01:01:08.334 --> 01:01:10.234
that I did in town for years.

01:01:10.267 --> 01:01:12.200
Somebody would come to
me hurt and I'd be like,

01:01:12.234 --> 01:01:16.734
oh, it's like--nobody
knew who I was in town

01:01:16.767 --> 01:01:18.167
for 20 years.

01:01:18.200 --> 01:01:24.400
So I do the gentlest, least
obtrusive laying on of hands.

01:01:24.434 --> 01:01:26.234
You know, where it's like,
oh, you know,

01:01:26.267 --> 01:01:28.467
this probably stung
like the dickens,

01:01:28.501 --> 01:01:30.000
but, you know--

01:01:30.033 --> 01:01:31.067
Look at this,
look at this,

01:01:31.100 --> 01:01:32.901
it's just rubbing,
this is just--

01:01:32.934 --> 01:01:35.167
TRAVIS: Oh, you skinned your knees,
let me blow on that.

01:01:35.200 --> 01:01:36.801
(cross talk)

01:01:36.834 --> 01:01:37.901
LAURA: And I'm hugging you.

01:01:37.934 --> 01:01:39.133
MARISHA: Why am I so cold?

01:01:39.167 --> 01:01:42.067
LAURA: I heal Vax 12 points
while I'm hugging him.

01:01:42.100 --> 01:01:44.300
SAM: I take a little potion.

01:01:44.334 --> 01:01:45.934
TALIESIN: Try and clear
my guns in the hopes

01:01:45.968 --> 01:01:48.501
that they're
actually gonna work.

01:01:48.534 --> 01:01:50.033
So proficiency?

01:01:50.067 --> 01:01:53.267
PATRICK: Uh, so down, like you can soak
up another 30, I'm assuming?

01:01:53.300 --> 01:02:00.100
MARISHA: Yeah, I have 118 max, so.

01:02:00.133 --> 01:02:03.834
PATRICK: Then, yeah,
soak up a full 35.

01:02:03.868 --> 01:02:05.434
TALIESIN: Whoa, there you go.

01:02:05.467 --> 01:02:06.701
Are we calling
this a short rest?

01:02:06.734 --> 01:02:09.400
Is that what's
happening right now?

01:02:09.434 --> 01:02:12.100
Are we having, like, some sort
of spontaneous short rest?

01:02:12.133 --> 01:02:14.057
MATT: If you would like
to take a short rest--

01:02:14.057 --> 01:02:16.400
TALIESIN: Oh, my God.

01:02:16.434 --> 01:02:18.100
LIAM: I got 16 hit dice, man.

01:02:18.133 --> 01:02:21.267
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm gonna burn
a few hit dice as well.

01:02:21.300 --> 01:02:23.627
TRAVIS: So there is a full blown war
happening up on--

01:02:23.627 --> 01:02:25.434
SAM: Oh, shit, that's true.

01:02:25.467 --> 01:02:27.167
TALIESIN: Yeah, you know,
we just fought two dragons,

01:02:27.200 --> 01:02:29.934
they can handle this.

01:02:29.968 --> 01:02:31.701
MATT: Okay, so you're all
taking a short rest before

01:02:31.734 --> 01:02:33.200
or your going to
the gold and not taking--

01:02:33.234 --> 01:02:35.267
-TRAVIS: Gold.
-MATT: Okay.

01:02:35.300 --> 01:02:36.634
So as you all take a moment--

01:02:36.667 --> 01:02:38.198
TRAVIS: There's a lot
of talking happening,

01:02:38.198 --> 01:02:39.667
I just wandered off.

01:02:39.701 --> 01:02:41.567
MATT: So as you guys begin
to take the rests,

01:02:41.601 --> 01:02:44.234
tend to your wounds,
take a breather,

01:02:44.267 --> 01:02:45.734
and begin to mentally
prepare yourself

01:02:45.767 --> 01:02:47.834
for whatever the next stage
of your journey is.

01:02:47.868 --> 01:02:49.334
Grog, you step out
into the cavern,

01:02:49.367 --> 01:02:51.234
now without the
red in your eyes

01:02:51.267 --> 01:02:53.601
that normally calls to
combat where your focus is on

01:02:53.634 --> 01:02:55.901
what you can hurt and
kill as soon as possible.

01:02:55.934 --> 01:02:58.501
Now it's what can loot and
keep as soon as possible.

01:02:58.534 --> 01:03:01.200
And make an
investigation check.

01:03:01.234 --> 01:03:04.100
TRAVIS: Okay, gonna be high.

01:03:04.133 --> 01:03:07.467
Oh, 17 plus, minus 2.

01:03:07.501 --> 01:03:08.901
-Fifteen.
-MATT: Fifteen.

01:03:08.934 --> 01:03:13.400
Uh, doesn't matter too much

01:03:13.434 --> 01:03:15.334
as you walk in and begin
taking in the surroundings,

01:03:15.367 --> 01:03:17.501
you can see there
are edges of the cavern

01:03:17.534 --> 01:03:22.601
that are just crammed
with gold and platinum

01:03:22.634 --> 01:03:29.100
and art fixtures and vases,
and golden, brass, and silver

01:03:29.133 --> 01:03:31.601
keepsakes and knick-knacks
and decorations.

01:03:31.634 --> 01:03:33.634
You can see chains
and candelabras

01:03:33.667 --> 01:03:35.334
You can see all sorts--

01:03:35.367 --> 01:03:38.334
it looks like
and you kind of--

01:03:38.367 --> 01:03:41.188
some of you gleaned this
as you went in here.

01:03:41.188 --> 01:03:43.033
This is more wealth
than you've ever seen

01:03:43.067 --> 01:03:44.167
in your entire life.

01:03:44.200 --> 01:03:49.033
This...this is probably
a majority of the wealth

01:03:49.067 --> 01:03:52.534
of Emon that has been slowly
brought to Thordak

01:03:52.567 --> 01:03:57.267
and forced into his lair
as part of the tyranny

01:03:57.300 --> 01:04:01.033
that he took over the city.

01:04:01.067 --> 01:04:03.801
So, all the money
here has been amassed

01:04:03.834 --> 01:04:06.734
from the guilds,
from the villagers,

01:04:06.767 --> 01:04:10.100
from the townsfolk,
from the temples,

01:04:10.133 --> 01:04:14.667
from the shops,
from the Cloudtop.

01:04:14.701 --> 01:04:17.734
This is the economy of Emon

01:04:17.767 --> 01:04:20.100
crammed into, at least
a majority of it,

01:04:20.133 --> 01:04:21.868
into a singular cavern.

01:04:21.901 --> 01:04:26.334
TRAVIS: I feel overwhelmed by
the sheer amount of stuff.

01:04:26.367 --> 01:04:30.100
Are there any, like,
unique looking knick-knacks

01:04:30.133 --> 01:04:33.701
or really lovely or
dangerous looking weapons

01:04:33.734 --> 01:04:35.033
that grab my eye?

01:04:35.067 --> 01:04:36.534
Because it's just
a lot of shit.

01:04:36.567 --> 01:04:39.000
MATT: Well, as based on your
investigation check,

01:04:39.033 --> 01:04:44.734
which is a 15, um, you do
find a couple of fun things.

01:04:44.767 --> 01:04:47.324
You find a...

01:04:48.068 --> 01:04:49.868
TRAVIS: I love it when he
reaches for stuff.

01:04:49.901 --> 01:04:51.133
LAURA: I know.

01:04:51.167 --> 01:04:55.167
MATT: You find a somewhat familiar
looking metallic rod

01:04:55.200 --> 01:04:58.067
about that long, cylindrical.

01:04:58.100 --> 01:05:02.567
Looks to have a couple of small,
almost ring divots on it.

01:05:02.601 --> 01:05:04.100
You're pretty
sure you have one of these.

01:05:04.133 --> 01:05:05.367
LAURA: Immovable rod.

01:05:05.400 --> 01:05:06.534
TRAVIS: What?

01:05:06.567 --> 01:05:07.667
SAM: Immovable rod.

01:05:07.701 --> 01:05:09.567
-TRAVIS: Yeah.
-SAM: Who has ours?

01:05:09.601 --> 01:05:12.067
-LAURA: I think I have it.
-MATT: You've seen it?

01:05:12.100 --> 01:05:14.501
SAM: Why don't we use that more?

01:05:14.534 --> 01:05:18.467
TRAVIS: Oh, no, no, it's
not the same thing.

01:05:18.501 --> 01:05:19.434
LAURA: Ooh.

01:05:19.467 --> 01:05:21.367
MARISHA: Oh, yeah,
you'd be like climbing.

01:05:21.400 --> 01:05:24.300
TRAVIS: This is different,
this is a movable rod.

01:05:24.334 --> 01:05:27.047
SAM: Oh, it's a movable one,
not an immovable one?

01:05:27.047 --> 01:05:28.968
PATRICK: Just, which means
it's just a rod.

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:30.667
MATT: It's just a rod, basically.

01:05:30.701 --> 01:05:33.157
TALIESIN: It's a shake weight,
it's a shake weight,

01:05:33.167 --> 01:05:35.567
(laughing)

01:05:35.601 --> 01:05:37.434
It can't stop moving.

01:05:37.467 --> 01:05:40.133
LIAM: You sullied
Dungeons and Dragons.

01:05:40.167 --> 01:05:41.334
TALIESIN: I would hope so.

01:05:41.367 --> 01:05:44.601
MATT: Mind you, that fighter's
forearms look amazing.

01:05:44.634 --> 01:05:47.667
So you pick that up
and you start glancing through

01:05:47.701 --> 01:05:49.000
and you're just kind
of pushing through

01:05:49.033 --> 01:05:50.534
some of the art objects--

01:05:50.567 --> 01:05:52.767
a large painting that
just breaks in half.

01:05:52.801 --> 01:05:54.968
TRAVIS: If there's a vase I
would totally smash that.

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:56.667
MATT: You smash a
few vases, actually.

01:05:56.701 --> 01:05:58.901
TALIESIN: Ironically, there are
two gold coins inside.

01:05:58.934 --> 01:06:02.567
(laughing)

01:06:02.601 --> 01:06:05.234
MATT: Um, you also do
see to the side

01:06:05.267 --> 01:06:09.300
a...what looks to be a
wooden box about that big

01:06:09.334 --> 01:06:10.434
that is latched shut.

01:06:10.467 --> 01:06:14.334
It has beautiful
engraving all across it.

01:06:14.367 --> 01:06:16.400
And what looks to
be almost like gold leaf

01:06:16.434 --> 01:06:19.167
with little gems
of blue and red

01:06:19.200 --> 01:06:20.534
kind of toward the corners.

01:06:20.567 --> 01:06:24.868
It's a really beautiful artisan
wooden box about that big.

01:06:24.901 --> 01:06:29.868
And then there is a large, looks
like a beautiful tapestry

01:06:29.901 --> 01:06:31.334
that is rolled up and bound.

01:06:31.367 --> 01:06:32.767
TRAVIS: Okay, that's boring.

01:06:32.801 --> 01:06:35.901
The box, like does it look
like it's simple to open?

01:06:35.934 --> 01:06:38.434
MATT: Uh, you pick
it up and look at it.

01:06:38.467 --> 01:06:40.667
It has a little latch on it.

01:06:40.701 --> 01:06:42.367
-TRAVIS: What would--
-MATT: Make an intelligence check.

01:06:42.400 --> 01:06:45.801
TRAVIS: What would that guy that's
always sneaking around do?

01:06:45.834 --> 01:06:50.100
Intelligence check
two minus--yeah two, okay.

01:06:50.133 --> 01:06:54.167
-So, zero.
-MATT: Zero.

01:06:54.200 --> 01:06:57.234
You shake it, there's something
inside it, rattles around.

01:06:57.267 --> 01:06:58.200
It's got a little heft to it.

01:06:58.234 --> 01:06:59.367
TALIESIN: Oh, boy.

01:06:59.400 --> 01:07:01.400
MATT: You look at it, try
and pry open the side.

01:07:01.434 --> 01:07:02.434
Nothing.

01:07:02.467 --> 01:07:03.901
TRAVIS: Even with the
titanstone knuckles,

01:07:03.934 --> 01:07:04.901
it doesn't open?

01:07:04.934 --> 01:07:05.868
MATT: You want to
use your strength?

01:07:05.901 --> 01:07:07.027
Go and roll
a strength check.

01:07:07.027 --> 01:07:08.434
-TRAVIS: Yeah.
-MATT: Force it open.

01:07:08.467 --> 01:07:10.200
LIAM: You're going to break
a wonderful item.

01:07:10.234 --> 01:07:12.334
TRAVIS: Dammit.

01:07:12.367 --> 01:07:13.467
Eleven.

01:07:13.501 --> 01:07:14.534
MATT: Eleven, okay.

01:07:14.567 --> 01:07:16.634
TRAVIS: That was a low roll.

01:07:16.667 --> 01:07:22.767
MATT: Uh, you crssshh and the wooden
case just breaks in half.

01:07:22.801 --> 01:07:24.100
And as it does,
you see what looks to be

01:07:24.133 --> 01:07:26.501
a small leather sleeve,

01:07:26.534 --> 01:07:30.234
similar shape kind
of pfff and land.

01:07:30.267 --> 01:07:31.267
-TRAVIS: I'll go get it.
-MATT: Pick it up.

01:07:31.300 --> 01:07:32.467
And it's a leather pouch,

01:07:32.501 --> 01:07:34.667
it has a little top,
it's buttoned shut.

01:07:34.701 --> 01:07:36.100
And it looks like there's
something inside,

01:07:36.133 --> 01:07:37.200
almost like cards.

01:07:37.234 --> 01:07:40.434
MARISHA: No, no.

01:07:40.467 --> 01:07:43.567
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah, open the sleeve,
the leather sleeve.

01:07:43.601 --> 01:07:44.434
PATRICK: No.

01:07:44.467 --> 01:07:46.300
MATT: What are you gonna pull out?

01:07:46.334 --> 01:07:48.067
MARISHA: You wish.

01:07:48.100 --> 01:07:49.434
MATT: You open it
and you can see inside

01:07:49.467 --> 01:07:52.167
what looks to
be about 13 cards,

01:07:52.200 --> 01:07:53.701
tarot looking cards.

01:07:53.734 --> 01:07:55.868
-TRAVIS: Little cards.
-MATT: Cards, yeah.

01:07:55.901 --> 01:07:57.701
TRAVIS: Do they smell
like anything?

01:07:57.734 --> 01:08:00.801
MATT: Uh, they smell
clean and fresh.

01:08:00.834 --> 01:08:04.367
TRAVIS: How far away is the lava?

01:08:04.400 --> 01:08:07.200
MATT: Um, maybe from where you are
right now in this portion,

01:08:07.234 --> 01:08:09.167
I'd say 25 feet.

01:08:09.200 --> 01:08:11.400
-TRAVIS: Who the hell uses--
-LAURA: No, Travis!

01:08:11.434 --> 01:08:14.634
(laughing)

01:08:14.667 --> 01:08:17.000
-TRAVIS: What?
-LAURA: What are you even doing?

01:08:17.033 --> 01:08:18.234
TRAVIS: I'm going through the loot,

01:08:18.267 --> 01:08:19.968
you all are fucking
healing and shit,

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:21.701
I'm trying to find
something useful here.

01:08:21.734 --> 01:08:23.133
TALIESIN: Did you find
anything useful?

01:08:23.167 --> 01:08:24.901
LIAM: Laura Bailey manifested.

01:08:24.934 --> 01:08:27.667
(laughing)

01:08:29.567 --> 01:08:31.367
Oh, harp please, poof!

01:08:31.399 --> 01:08:33.399
MATT: As you guys have
been resting, to be fair,

01:08:33.434 --> 01:08:34.767
as you're all sitting there
in the tunnel kind of talking,

01:08:34.801 --> 01:08:36.773
you hear in the distance
an occasional like

01:08:36.773 --> 01:08:38.200
ting, ting, ting, clunk.

01:08:38.234 --> 01:08:39.600
You look in the distance
and you see Grog

01:08:39.634 --> 01:08:41.667
just like rummaging through
the loot and throwing shit.

01:08:41.701 --> 01:08:43.300
-TRAVIS: Pretty much.
-LAURA: What are you doing?

01:08:43.334 --> 01:08:44.533
TRAVIS: What, I'm trying
to find something.

01:08:44.567 --> 01:08:46.667
There's a giant rolled
up carpet over here.

01:08:46.701 --> 01:08:48.133
LAURA: A carpet?

01:08:48.167 --> 01:08:51.834
TRAVIS: Yeah, I mean some people call
it a telafaphy or whatever.

01:08:51.868 --> 01:08:53.968
LAURA: I go over to Grog.

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:55.767
What do you
have in your hand?

01:08:55.801 --> 01:08:59.533
TRAVIS: Uh, I don't know, it looks
like a bunch of cards.

01:08:59.567 --> 01:09:00.667
LAURA: Can I see them?

01:09:00.701 --> 01:09:02.033
TRAVIS: No, they're mine,
I found them.

01:09:02.067 --> 01:09:05.968
You have all of this stuff
to choose from, have at it.

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.701
LAURA: What's that tapestry
he's talking about?

01:09:08.734 --> 01:09:10.067
MATT: Uh, the tapestry
that's bound up?

01:09:10.100 --> 01:09:10.767
-LAURA: Yeah.
-MATT: Go and make

01:09:10.801 --> 01:09:12.501
an investigation check.

01:09:12.533 --> 01:09:14.167
TALIESIN: I'm gonna start
wandering into this mess.

01:09:14.200 --> 01:09:17.200
This is exciting.

01:09:17.234 --> 01:09:18.300
LAURA: Twenty four.

01:09:18.334 --> 01:09:19.834
MATT: Okay, as you quickly go over,

01:09:19.868 --> 01:09:24.267
you find--there are a
number of what look to be

01:09:24.300 --> 01:09:25.801
types of decoration,
wall tapestries.

01:09:25.834 --> 01:09:28.868
And there one
that Grog caught

01:09:28.901 --> 01:09:30.533
that it's a very,
very fine material,

01:09:30.567 --> 01:09:31.901
it looks like it's
probably expensive.

01:09:31.934 --> 01:09:34.801
Made of a very deep
dyed navy blue silk

01:09:34.834 --> 01:09:40.167
with looks to be a very, very
light tan pattern across it.

01:09:40.200 --> 01:09:44.200
As you unravel it, it's
roughly six foot by nine foot.

01:09:44.234 --> 01:09:46.767
Um, it rolls out
in front of you.

01:09:46.801 --> 01:09:49.734
LAURA: Do you fly, fly?

01:09:49.767 --> 01:09:51.267
Try to fly right now.

01:09:51.300 --> 01:09:53.000
Go up in the air.

01:09:53.033 --> 01:09:54.501
(spit)

01:09:54.534 --> 01:09:56.400
-TRAVIS: No.
-PATRICK: Did you just spit on it?

01:09:56.434 --> 01:09:58.901
LAURA: Well, that's my code word
for my flying broom.

01:09:58.934 --> 01:10:01.267
MATT: Chuck on it, you'll fly.

01:10:01.300 --> 01:10:03.534
Which sounds like chat-oo!

01:10:03.567 --> 01:10:04.701
MARISHA: Naturally.

01:10:04.734 --> 01:10:05.968
MATT: What do you want to do,

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.434
do you want to spend
some time with the tapestry?

01:10:08.467 --> 01:10:10.300
LAURA: No, I'm gonna roll it up
and save it for later

01:10:10.334 --> 01:10:11.734
and look around
for other cool stuff.

01:10:11.767 --> 01:10:14.267
MATT: Okay, so you grab
the tapestry and roll it up

01:10:14.300 --> 01:10:17.033
and toss it to the side.

01:10:17.067 --> 01:10:18.400
TRAVIS: There's really
no way around this,

01:10:18.434 --> 01:10:20.130
I've got to pull a card

01:10:20.130 --> 01:10:22.133
out of the
leather sleeve, right?

01:10:22.167 --> 01:10:23.300
LIAM: Are you gonna take
this fucking tapestry

01:10:23.334 --> 01:10:24.367
or you're gonna
look around the room?

01:10:24.400 --> 01:10:25.267
MATT: All right, so you
pull one card out?

01:10:25.300 --> 01:10:26.400
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'll pull one card out,

01:10:26.434 --> 01:10:28.100
but I want to pull
the one in the middle

01:10:28.133 --> 01:10:30.267
because I remember
magicians be like,

01:10:30.300 --> 01:10:31.968
choose a card, any card.

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.234
LIAM: Travis, you could
destroy the world.

01:10:34.267 --> 01:10:35.834
TALIESIN: I'm so excited.

01:10:35.868 --> 01:10:38.077
TRAVIS: I mean, on any day, but you're
lucky I'm really in control.

01:10:38.077 --> 01:10:39.734
LAURA: I don't know what can
come out of that thing,

01:10:39.767 --> 01:10:42.634
but like, really
bad things can come out.

01:10:42.667 --> 01:10:45.200
TRAVIS: What is that, I don't
even know what that is.

01:10:45.234 --> 01:10:47.467
MATT: Ryan, do we have a
deck of cards anywhere?

01:10:47.501 --> 01:10:49.601
MARISHA: Jesus Christ.

01:10:49.634 --> 01:10:51.300
TRAVIS: What is this?

01:10:51.334 --> 01:10:52.100
PATRICK: I probably...

01:10:52.133 --> 01:10:52.968
MATT: Just regular playing cards.

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:54.267
(Ryan) I'm going to look for some.

01:10:54.300 --> 01:10:56.654
TRAVIS: Is it fair to say that everyone
knows what this is but me?

01:10:56.654 --> 01:10:58.100
SAM: I don't know what it is.

01:10:58.133 --> 01:10:59.868
TRAVIS: Sam doesn't know.

01:10:59.901 --> 01:11:02.334
LAURA: I've heard that--oh, God,
there's cards right there.

01:11:02.367 --> 01:11:03.634
They had 'em right there!

01:11:03.667 --> 01:11:04.734
MATT: Thank you.

01:11:04.767 --> 01:11:06.300
TRAVIS: Scanlan doesn't
know what this is.

01:11:06.334 --> 01:11:07.200
Do you know what this is?

01:11:07.234 --> 01:11:08.188
LIAM: Yes.

01:11:08.188 --> 01:11:09.330
TRAVIS: Laura, do you know?

01:11:09.330 --> 01:11:10.934
LAURA: I know it's really--
it can be really bad.

01:11:10.968 --> 01:11:12.467
TRAVIS: Patrick, do you
know what this is?

01:11:12.501 --> 01:11:15.834
LAURA: Didn't they pull this out
during one of the charity games?

01:11:15.868 --> 01:11:20.234
LIAM: Amazing and great or it
could be totally destructive.

01:11:20.267 --> 01:11:22.868
TRAVIS: I'm feeling amazing
and great right now.

01:11:22.901 --> 01:11:26.133
LAURA: Oh, God, oh, God.

01:11:26.167 --> 01:11:28.067
LIAM: Aren't you glad you're here?

01:11:28.067 --> 01:11:30.734
PATRICK: I'm so--there's nothing
I'd rather be here for.

01:11:30.767 --> 01:11:33.300
TRAVIS: Oh really, just straight up?

01:11:33.334 --> 01:11:34.601
MATT: All righty, so.

01:11:34.634 --> 01:11:37.067
TRAVIS: That's unfortunate.

01:11:37.100 --> 01:11:40.657
(cross talk)

01:11:40.657 --> 01:11:43.733
LIAM: I'm sweating harder than the
dragon fight right now.

01:11:43.733 --> 01:11:45.868
(cross talk)

01:11:45.901 --> 01:11:47.234
MATT: Be patient here
for a second, folks,

01:11:47.267 --> 01:11:49.000
as I have to pull out the
proper deck here so I know--

01:11:49.033 --> 01:11:50.467
(cross talk)

01:11:50.501 --> 01:11:54.234
As Travis now currently
pulling a card out of

01:11:54.267 --> 01:11:56.834
some sort of enchanted deck.

01:11:56.868 --> 01:11:59.400
TRAVIS: It's called
an enchanted deck?

01:11:59.434 --> 01:12:01.081
LIAM: If he wins, he can win big.

01:12:01.081 --> 01:12:02.868
TRAVIS: Is there a name for it,
whatever this is?

01:12:02.901 --> 01:12:04.167
-PATRICK: Oh, yes.
-TRAVIS: What's the name?

01:12:04.200 --> 01:12:05.234
TALIESIN: Idiocy.

01:12:05.267 --> 01:12:06.601
LIAM: Yes.

01:12:06.634 --> 01:12:07.667
LIAM: We'll tell you later.

01:12:07.701 --> 01:12:09.434
(cross talk)

01:12:09.467 --> 01:12:11.501
'Cause we're all
out of character.

01:12:11.534 --> 01:12:12.701
TRAVIS: I genuinely
am only doing this

01:12:12.734 --> 01:12:14.467
because I don't know
what the hell it is.

01:12:14.501 --> 01:12:18.234
PATRICK: Which is perfect,
it's perfect, perfect.

01:12:18.267 --> 01:12:19.767
This could not be better.

01:12:19.801 --> 01:12:22.247
Although honestly, they're
like--and into the lava

01:12:22.247 --> 01:12:23.701
would also be perfect, yeah.

01:12:23.734 --> 01:12:26.000
MARISHA: That would be perfect, yeah.

01:12:26.033 --> 01:12:28.133
TRAVIS: Would that have activated
all of them and then...?

01:12:28.167 --> 01:12:29.834
LAURA: I don't know.

01:12:29.868 --> 01:12:31.801
MARISHA: You can't really destroy
magical items though, right?

01:12:31.834 --> 01:12:34.227
TALIESIN: No, they would have just
put them into the rock.

01:12:34.227 --> 01:12:35.701
TRAVIS: Oh, they're magical...

01:12:35.734 --> 01:12:37.367
MATT: In my rush to
get everything ready,

01:12:37.367 --> 01:12:38.868
-I did not...
-SAM: How dare you.

01:12:38.901 --> 01:12:41.734
LAURA: How dare you not prepare?

01:12:41.767 --> 01:12:44.067
MATT: Well, there was that too,
but you know.

01:12:44.100 --> 01:12:46.300
I learn lessons
the hard way sometimes.

01:12:46.334 --> 01:12:48.067
LAURA: If Travis gets
a hold of it...

01:12:48.100 --> 01:12:50.067
LIAM: Not ready for eSports, Matt.

01:12:50.100 --> 01:12:51.634
(laughing)

01:12:51.667 --> 01:12:53.061
MATT: I hate you so much.

01:12:53.061 --> 01:12:54.801
(laughing)

01:12:54.834 --> 01:12:57.834
TRAVIS: Not ready for...

01:12:57.868 --> 01:12:59.367
-MATT: Okay.
-TALIESIN: So excited.

01:12:59.400 --> 01:13:02.000
LAURA: Oh, God, I'm terrified.

01:13:02.033 --> 01:13:04.200
I don't know what all the
things are that they can do.

01:13:04.234 --> 01:13:05.367
TALIESIN: I don't think I would
have the guts to do it.

01:13:05.400 --> 01:13:07.200
I think--'cause I would know,

01:13:07.234 --> 01:13:08.634
I would not have the guts.

01:13:08.667 --> 01:13:10.334
TRAVIS: 'Cause you know what it is.

01:13:10.367 --> 01:13:12.868
Well, there's like 13 cards,
how bad can it be?

01:13:12.901 --> 01:13:14.934
What's the percentage
of bad cards to good cards?

01:13:14.968 --> 01:13:16.267
LIAM: It's mostly bad.

01:13:16.300 --> 01:13:17.634
TRAVIS: It's mostly bad?

01:13:17.667 --> 01:13:19.901
LAURA: Do you know, you know,
you know all the cards.

01:13:19.934 --> 01:13:20.901
LIAM: But the goods are amazing.

01:13:20.934 --> 01:13:22.493
MATT: Shuffle these
here for a minute.

01:13:22.493 --> 01:13:24.133
LAURA: Oh, God, oh, God!

01:13:24.167 --> 01:13:26.640
Oh, my God, what if
we're all about to die?

01:13:26.640 --> 01:13:28.467
'Cause it could
be world ending, right?

01:13:28.501 --> 01:13:29.667
It could just...

01:13:29.701 --> 01:13:33.067
MARISHA: I'm with Kerr
in the hall, right?

01:13:33.100 --> 01:13:35.000
MATT: You guys are all just resting.

01:13:35.033 --> 01:13:38.000
And Vax is asleep.

01:13:38.033 --> 01:13:40.334
SAM: I'm checking to see if
there's any more in the flute

01:13:40.367 --> 01:13:42.334
that didn't get burned.

01:13:42.367 --> 01:13:45.334
-MATT: Uh...
-LIAM: Now is the time.

01:13:45.367 --> 01:13:47.400
TALIESIN: Smoke 'em if you got 'em.

01:13:47.434 --> 01:13:48.868
MATT: Literally.

01:13:48.901 --> 01:13:50.267
As you check the flute,

01:13:50.300 --> 01:13:54.901
what you put in the flute
has been expended, yes.

01:13:54.934 --> 01:14:00.601
All right, so I want you
to just pull one of these--

01:14:00.634 --> 01:14:02.868
I'll turn them around, shuffle.

01:14:02.901 --> 01:14:04.000
TRAVIS: How many pulls do I get?

01:14:04.033 --> 01:14:05.710
MATT: You said you were
just pulling one card,

01:14:05.710 --> 01:14:07.801
so you pull one card.

01:14:07.834 --> 01:14:10.000
TALIESIN: Only Travis,
Travis is the only one.

01:14:10.033 --> 01:14:10.968
MATT: What's it say?

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:12.434
MARISHA: You have this
conviction to your voice

01:14:12.467 --> 01:14:14.501
that's just--I believe you.

01:14:14.534 --> 01:14:16.267
PATRICK: I'm very calming.

01:14:16.300 --> 01:14:17.567
MATT: All right, good to know.

01:14:17.601 --> 01:14:18.634
SAM: Good to know.

01:14:18.667 --> 01:14:21.234
Oh, good to know,
you all die.

01:14:21.267 --> 01:14:22.767
LAURA: It's a giant...

01:14:22.801 --> 01:14:25.267
TALIESIN: No, don't look at the screen,
don't look at the screen.

01:14:25.300 --> 01:14:27.100
That's not gonna
make anyone feel better.

01:14:27.133 --> 01:14:29.767
(cross talk)

01:14:29.801 --> 01:14:31.267
MARISHA: 50 gold, 50--
50,000 gold.

01:14:31.300 --> 01:14:32.534
LIAM: No whammies, no whammies.

01:14:32.567 --> 01:14:33.434
MATT: Okay.

01:14:33.467 --> 01:14:34.868
SAM: He's turning more pages, why?

01:14:34.901 --> 01:14:36.367
Why more pages?

01:14:36.400 --> 01:14:37.567
PATRICK: I'm actually sweating.

01:14:37.601 --> 01:14:39.234
SAM: You should only
be on one page.

01:14:39.267 --> 01:14:41.634
Why would he need to be
on multiple pages?

01:14:41.667 --> 01:14:43.467
(cross talk)

01:14:43.501 --> 01:14:47.300
TALIESIN: It's a centerfold.

01:14:47.334 --> 01:14:49.934
LIAM: It's the most powerful
thing in the book.

01:14:49.968 --> 01:14:51.434
MATT: Okay, hold on, I have
to go back for a--

01:14:51.467 --> 01:14:53.033
SAM: Why are there
more pages, Matt?

01:14:53.067 --> 01:14:55.234
MATT: You'll find out,
you'll find out.

01:14:55.267 --> 01:14:57.434
TRAVIS: Why would you give me that?!

01:14:57.467 --> 01:14:59.901
(laughing)

01:14:59.934 --> 01:15:02.300
MARISHA: I was asking
the same question.

01:15:02.334 --> 01:15:03.868
TRAVIS: You give me
like chastity belts or--

01:15:03.901 --> 01:15:06.367
MATT: Look, man, the last
thing I expected was Grog

01:15:06.400 --> 01:15:08.901
to be the first to loot
for magical items.

01:15:08.934 --> 01:15:11.400
And roll a decent
investigation check.

01:15:11.434 --> 01:15:15.667
And yet, here you are,
discovering this deck.

01:15:15.701 --> 01:15:17.601
All right, so...

01:15:17.634 --> 01:15:20.133
With this...

01:15:20.167 --> 01:15:24.534
You pull the card out and it
looks like this beautiful

01:15:24.567 --> 01:15:28.067
tarot like design of what
looks like a metallic key

01:15:28.100 --> 01:15:30.801
that is currently
held aloft in space

01:15:30.834 --> 01:15:33.200
behind what looks
like almost like the stars

01:15:33.234 --> 01:15:39.167
converging into some sort of
a pattern in the night sky.

01:15:39.200 --> 01:15:40.977
TRAVIS: That's good, stars are nice.

01:15:40.977 --> 01:15:42.167
MATT: At this point--

01:15:42.200 --> 01:15:43.467
TRAVIS: Orion wouldn't fuck us.

01:15:43.501 --> 01:15:45.400
LIAM: Nope.

01:15:45.434 --> 01:15:50.200
PATRICK: That's not a
sword on his belt.

01:15:50.234 --> 01:15:51.667
MATT: As you pull the card
and look at it,

01:15:51.701 --> 01:15:55.501
the card bursts into flames,

01:15:55.534 --> 01:15:57.868
and you feel this slight
tingling in the hand

01:15:57.901 --> 01:16:01.567
that held the card.

01:16:01.601 --> 01:16:04.267
Suddenly, you watch as
there's a flash of light

01:16:04.300 --> 01:16:06.267
within your grasp with
what looks to be extending

01:16:06.300 --> 01:16:08.801
from where the card once was.

01:16:08.834 --> 01:16:12.601
You immediately feel
something steel in your hand

01:16:12.634 --> 01:16:14.400
and as you clutch your fingers
instinctually around it,

01:16:14.434 --> 01:16:16.100
and try to crush
whatever it is,

01:16:16.133 --> 01:16:20.868
you look and watch as this
beautiful looking scimitar

01:16:20.901 --> 01:16:23.334
like blade is now
in your grasp.

01:16:23.367 --> 01:16:25.968
TRAVIS: Oooh!

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:27.400
Whoa.

01:16:27.434 --> 01:16:33.400
MATT: It's beautifully made,
an ornate hilt and hand guard.

01:16:33.434 --> 01:16:36.334
And it has like a chain dangling
from the bottom of the pommel

01:16:36.367 --> 01:16:39.100
that has, looks like
a small blue gem.

01:16:39.133 --> 01:16:40.934
It's a beautiful
looking piece of weaponry.

01:16:40.968 --> 01:16:42.033
And as you whip
it back and forth,

01:16:42.067 --> 01:16:43.367
it's perfectly balanced.

01:16:43.400 --> 01:16:47.200
TRAVIS: Does it make any noise
when I swing it?

01:16:47.234 --> 01:16:49.267
LAURA: A card turned into a sword?

01:16:49.300 --> 01:16:51.567
SAM: We should pull the other cards
to see what swords they'll make.

01:16:51.601 --> 01:16:53.234
PATRICK: You can do that 12 more times!

01:16:53.267 --> 01:16:55.701
TRAVIS: I'm apparently the
most powerful sorcerer

01:16:55.734 --> 01:16:57.667
that has ever lived.

01:16:57.701 --> 01:17:00.634
SAM: This is a deck
of weapon cards.

01:17:00.667 --> 01:17:02.934
LAURA: I mean seriously, though.

01:17:02.968 --> 01:17:05.334
TRAVIS: I have to hit
something with it.

01:17:05.367 --> 01:17:06.567
LAURA: Well, go hit
something with it.

01:17:06.601 --> 01:17:09.901
TRAVIS: Is there like a tall
statue around or anything?

01:17:09.934 --> 01:17:13.100
MATT: I mean, you can see
there are a few marble busts

01:17:13.133 --> 01:17:17.100
and things that have been
collected from the more--

01:17:17.133 --> 01:17:18.667
TRAVIS: A marble bust is good,
that's perfect.

01:17:18.701 --> 01:17:20.204
TALIESIN: Please don't
decimate the antiquities.

01:17:20.204 --> 01:17:21.634
TRAVIS: Can I pick it up?

01:17:21.667 --> 01:17:23.000
Lob it--

01:17:23.033 --> 01:17:25.400
LAURA: Grog, also don't forget
this is property of Emon.

01:17:25.434 --> 01:17:26.734
TRAVIS: It just broke because
you distracted me.

01:17:26.767 --> 01:17:29.968
(laughing)

01:17:32.501 --> 01:17:34.701
I've got to go
find another bust.

01:17:34.734 --> 01:17:36.027
Is there another?

01:17:36.027 --> 01:17:37.457
MATT: There are a few, yeah.

01:17:37.457 --> 01:17:39.100
TRAVIS: Thank God there's another.

01:17:39.133 --> 01:17:41.841
MATT: You need to recognize,
some of these used to exist

01:17:41.841 --> 01:17:43.230
in the Alabaster Lyceum.

01:17:43.234 --> 01:17:47.033
These are actually busts
of old heralded teachers

01:17:47.067 --> 01:17:50.680
within the arcane halls
of the lyceum.

01:17:50.680 --> 01:17:53.133
-TRAVIS: They wrote on stuff, right?
-MATT: Yeah.

01:17:53.167 --> 01:17:55.967
TRAVIS: Okay, then nobody cares
what they looked like, cool.

01:17:55.967 --> 01:17:58.234
Take it and lob it
in the air, big swing.

01:17:58.267 --> 01:18:00.531
-MATT: Make an attack roll.
-TRAVIS: Okay.

01:18:01.894 --> 01:18:03.767
Can I make this
a reckless attack?

01:18:03.801 --> 01:18:05.667
MATT: You can.

01:18:05.701 --> 01:18:08.144
TALIESIN: Is it a strength
or dex weapon?

01:18:08.144 --> 01:18:09.467
MATT: It's a strength weapon.

01:18:09.501 --> 01:18:10.270
TALIESIN: Ah.

01:18:10.270 --> 01:18:11.567
TRAVIS: Twenty seven.

01:18:11.601 --> 01:18:14.400
MATT: Twenty seven.
Um, roll damage.

01:18:14.434 --> 01:18:17.534
It is considered a scimitar.

01:18:17.567 --> 01:18:18.367
TRAVIS: Okay.

01:18:18.400 --> 01:18:19.567
LAURA: A scimitar.

01:18:19.601 --> 01:18:21.667
MATT: It's a d8, I believe.

01:18:23.801 --> 01:18:26.297
MARISHA: It's considered a scimitar.

01:18:26.297 --> 01:18:27.601
TALIESIN: But really.

01:18:27.634 --> 01:18:30.067
PATRICK: It looks exactly
like a scimitar.

01:18:30.100 --> 01:18:31.340
TALIESIN: It's a meal.

01:18:31.340 --> 01:18:35.300
(cross talk)

01:18:35.334 --> 01:18:38.534
TRAVIS: I'm kind of doing it
off of the blood axe, so like 16?

01:18:38.567 --> 01:18:40.400
No necrotic no--

01:18:40.434 --> 01:18:42.100
MATT: No, no magical bonus on it.

01:18:42.133 --> 01:18:44.154
-TRAVIS: Just 16.
-MATT: 16, okay.

01:18:44.154 --> 01:18:45.868
And with your gauntlets
you have siege,

01:18:45.901 --> 01:18:48.027
which means you
do double damage

01:18:48.027 --> 01:18:49.467
against objects and structures.

01:18:49.501 --> 01:18:50.854
So as you take the sword back

01:18:50.854 --> 01:18:52.467
you strike the
edge of this bust

01:18:52.501 --> 01:18:56.400
and watch it just
turn to gravel and dust.

01:18:56.434 --> 01:18:59.117
Pshhh, it just shatters
and explodes out the side

01:18:59.117 --> 01:19:00.601
with one singular swing

01:19:00.634 --> 01:19:02.847
and you watch as
the small chunks of rock

01:19:02.847 --> 01:19:05.334
that still somewhat
resemble any sort of, you know,

01:19:05.367 --> 01:19:10.033
sculptured structure go
scattering across the black,

01:19:10.067 --> 01:19:12.868
you know, lava and magma
encrusted darkened floor

01:19:12.901 --> 01:19:14.734
of the cavern.

01:19:14.767 --> 01:19:16.334
Blade is untouched.

01:19:16.367 --> 01:19:18.934
TRAVIS: It is really
well balanced, that is,

01:19:18.968 --> 01:19:21.711
and I just hold
it up to my ear.

01:19:22.934 --> 01:19:24.767
(laughing)

01:19:24.801 --> 01:19:26.734
MATT: A moment passes.

01:19:26.767 --> 01:19:28.000
A second moment passes.

01:19:28.033 --> 01:19:29.700
-TRAVIS: We're good.
-LAURA: Yeah.

01:19:29.700 --> 01:19:30.868
TRAVIS: We're totally good.

01:19:30.901 --> 01:19:32.161
SAM: It's a cool weapon.

01:19:32.161 --> 01:19:33.133
TRAVIS: It is, yeah.

01:19:33.167 --> 01:19:38.854
And I stealthily try
and pocket the other cards.

01:19:39.868 --> 01:19:41.501
LAURA: What are you doing?

01:19:41.534 --> 01:19:45.133
TRAVIS: But I haven't showered in
a few days and my bum itches.

01:19:45.167 --> 01:19:47.431
MATT: Make a slight of
hand check, Grog.

01:19:47.431 --> 01:19:50.160
(laughing)

01:19:50.160 --> 01:19:52.133
TRAVIS: Shit, that's a natural 1!

01:19:52.167 --> 01:19:54.767
(laughing)

01:19:54.801 --> 01:19:56.300
God damn it!

01:19:56.334 --> 01:20:00.200
MATT: You watch as Grog so
discreetly takes the cards

01:20:00.234 --> 01:20:02.601
and just kind of throws them.

01:20:02.634 --> 01:20:05.817
(laughing)

01:20:05.817 --> 01:20:07.580
Somehow throws
them closer to you

01:20:07.580 --> 01:20:09.133
and in between
him and you guys,

01:20:09.167 --> 01:20:10.971
trying to hide them
and just go thdummp.

01:20:10.971 --> 01:20:12.367
LAURA: I pick them up.

01:20:12.400 --> 01:20:13.734
SAM: Does anyone know
what these are?

01:20:13.767 --> 01:20:15.601
LAURA: Grog just made a sword
out of one of these cards.

01:20:15.634 --> 01:20:16.734
Do we know what this is?

01:20:16.767 --> 01:20:18.367
TRAVIS: They only activate
under my magical touch.

01:20:18.400 --> 01:20:20.837
SAM: I'm gonna look at it
and just see if I happen

01:20:20.837 --> 01:20:22.133
to know anything about it.

01:20:22.167 --> 01:20:23.687
MATT: Roll an arcana check.

01:20:23.687 --> 01:20:26.334
SAM: I don't know
anything about it.

01:20:26.367 --> 01:20:28.834
I rolled a 12, do I
know anything about it?

01:20:28.868 --> 01:20:31.300
MATT: Mmm, they're
apparently magical.

01:20:31.334 --> 01:20:32.501
TALIESIN: Twenty three.

01:20:32.534 --> 01:20:36.167
MATT: Twenty three.
You, being a studious child

01:20:36.200 --> 01:20:38.770
and reading many things,
you've heard rumors,

01:20:38.770 --> 01:20:40.033
you have heard myths,

01:20:40.067 --> 01:20:43.367
you have heard
legends of glory and woe

01:20:43.400 --> 01:20:45.434
based around an
artifact referred to

01:20:45.467 --> 01:20:47.067
as the Deck of Many Things.

01:20:47.100 --> 01:20:48.901
LAURA: I start to open it up and--

01:20:48.934 --> 01:20:50.934
TALIESIN: No, no, no, no.

01:20:50.968 --> 01:20:52.801
No, oh, he looks--

01:20:52.834 --> 01:20:54.868
LAURA: I think these made weapons.

01:20:54.901 --> 01:20:56.868
TALIESIN: They can make
a lot of things.

01:20:56.901 --> 01:20:58.281
SAM: Can they make bad things?

01:20:58.281 --> 01:21:00.133
TALIESIN: They can make a
lot of bad things.

01:21:00.167 --> 01:21:01.767
SAM: And do you know
what activates them,

01:21:01.801 --> 01:21:03.100
just looking at a card?

01:21:03.133 --> 01:21:05.868
TALIESIN: If I recall,
it doesn't take much.

01:21:05.901 --> 01:21:08.957
LAURA: I just shut the little
case and stuff it in my...

01:21:08.957 --> 01:21:10.284
SAM: Let's keep it.

01:21:10.284 --> 01:21:12.200
TALIESIN: I was going to say
let's put it somewhere

01:21:12.234 --> 01:21:14.080
where no one will
ever find it,

01:21:14.080 --> 01:21:16.000
but that will
be fine for now.

01:21:16.033 --> 01:21:19.100
TRAVIS: May, may I--I actually,
I found that.

01:21:19.133 --> 01:21:20.901
LAURA: Oh, Grog, that's sweet.

01:21:20.934 --> 01:21:23.501
TRAVIS: But I don't, I want to
hold on to it, it's mine.

01:21:23.534 --> 01:21:24.501
LAURA: No.

01:21:24.534 --> 01:21:26.501
TRAVIS: You can keep
all the other gold.

01:21:26.534 --> 01:21:28.968
LAURA: Yeah, no, I don't
trust you with it.

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:29.801
TRAVIS: Why not?

01:21:29.834 --> 01:21:30.884
LAURA: Because you do stupid things.

01:21:30.884 --> 01:21:32.067
TRAVIS: Look what I made.

01:21:32.100 --> 01:21:33.834
LAURA: You made a beautiful sword
and I'm proud of you.

01:21:33.868 --> 01:21:36.167
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'm sure it's like
reactive its user--

01:21:36.200 --> 01:21:39.464
LAURA: Maybe there's another set
in here, we should find it!

01:21:39.464 --> 01:21:41.133
TRAVIS: And then you can have it.

01:21:41.167 --> 01:21:44.424
LAURA: No, if we find another set,
you can have it.

01:21:45.467 --> 01:21:47.127
LIAM: That's a bad deal, too.

01:21:47.127 --> 01:21:49.847
TRAVIS: I go to look for
another Deck of Many Things

01:21:49.847 --> 01:21:51.361
and nothing else.

01:21:51.361 --> 01:21:52.734
(laughing)

01:21:52.767 --> 01:21:55.634
MATT: For all the gold
that is in this cavern,

01:21:55.667 --> 01:21:59.834
none of it has any
luster or shine to you

01:21:59.868 --> 01:22:02.567
as your singularly focused
on finding another one

01:22:02.601 --> 01:22:04.000
of these deck of cards.

01:22:04.033 --> 01:22:07.100
You are throwing handfuls of
platinum over your shoulder.

01:22:07.133 --> 01:22:08.400
TRAVIS: Garbage.

01:22:08.434 --> 01:22:09.968
Rubbish, filth.

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:11.434
(laughing)

01:22:11.467 --> 01:22:14.033
Life has no luster
to it anymore.

01:22:14.067 --> 01:22:15.968
You wretched...

01:22:17.567 --> 01:22:21.434
MATT: All right, so continuing off of
your investigation check--

01:22:21.467 --> 01:22:23.567
-LIAM: What a heart attack.
-TALIESIN: Wow.

01:22:23.601 --> 01:22:25.734
MATT: So you do have the
Deck of Many Things

01:22:25.767 --> 01:22:27.200
which now has
12 cards in it.

01:22:27.234 --> 01:22:28.434
LAURA: Oh, my God.

01:22:28.467 --> 01:22:29.634
TALIESIN: Ah!

01:22:29.667 --> 01:22:31.400
MATT: I'm gonna hand that to Laura.

01:22:31.434 --> 01:22:35.267
SAM: Next time I go back to casino,
I'm taking that with me.

01:22:35.300 --> 01:22:37.434
MATT: You do--you
have that tapestry.

01:22:37.467 --> 01:22:41.367
You have--you find what
looks to be a pair of very fine

01:22:41.400 --> 01:22:44.400
crafted dark
green leather boots

01:22:44.434 --> 01:22:46.868
that have almost a silver
or platinum scrolling

01:22:46.901 --> 01:22:48.484
along the edges
of the leather,

01:22:48.484 --> 01:22:50.017
almost like
leaves and branches

01:22:50.017 --> 01:22:52.501
that tangle in towards
the front of the foot.

01:22:52.534 --> 01:22:53.968
LAURA: Do they look Elvish?

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:56.300
MATT: It looks Elvish in design.

01:22:56.334 --> 01:22:57.968
And you find
what looks to be

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:03.267
a very, very well
crafted war hammer.

01:23:03.300 --> 01:23:06.898
It has--its shape
and its design is--

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:10.167
and only because you've seen
this type of handle before--

01:23:10.200 --> 01:23:12.534
it appears to be
Dwarven in make.

01:23:12.567 --> 01:23:16.934
And it has a
series of runes and glyphs

01:23:16.968 --> 01:23:19.834
along the sides of
the war hammer head itself

01:23:19.868 --> 01:23:23.154
that seem to
give you the sense

01:23:23.154 --> 01:23:24.701
that this is a very expensive,

01:23:24.734 --> 01:23:27.467
or at least a very, very
elegantly crafted weapon.

01:23:27.501 --> 01:23:29.000
LAURA: Okay.

01:23:33.567 --> 01:23:35.067
Sweet.

01:23:35.100 --> 01:23:38.133
I can't, can I see if
they're magic, I can't can I?

01:23:38.167 --> 01:23:41.567
MATT: I mean, you can take
the rest of your short rest

01:23:41.601 --> 01:23:43.501
with one of the objects

01:23:43.534 --> 01:23:45.644
to see if you can
ascertain any sort of magic

01:23:45.644 --> 01:23:47.094
or information about it.

01:23:47.094 --> 01:23:49.400
LAURA: I'm gonna do that
on the tapestry.

01:23:49.434 --> 01:23:50.534
MATT: Okay.

01:23:50.567 --> 01:23:52.133
-TALIESIN: I'm with you.
-LAURA: Fly, fly for me.

01:23:52.167 --> 01:23:54.000
MATT: All right,
the rest of you guys,

01:23:54.033 --> 01:23:56.033
is there anything else should
rest, just healing up?

01:23:56.067 --> 01:23:57.937
TALIESIN: Healing up,
fixing my guns,

01:23:57.937 --> 01:23:59.997
and then sort of
trying to navigate

01:23:59.997 --> 01:24:01.467
some of this crazy in here

01:24:01.501 --> 01:24:03.033
and then eventually
looking around the cavern

01:24:03.067 --> 01:24:04.067
to see if there's anything.

01:24:04.100 --> 01:24:05.834
MATT: Has everyone
spent their hit dice?

01:24:05.868 --> 01:24:07.367
What are we at
in point totals here?

01:24:07.400 --> 01:24:08.968
SAM: Sixty eight.

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:10.334
TALIESIN: I've got 102.

01:24:10.367 --> 01:24:11.701
MARISHA: Seventy nine.

01:24:11.734 --> 01:24:12.667
MATT: I think you're still full.

01:24:12.701 --> 01:24:14.067
LIAM: Ninety nine.

01:24:14.100 --> 01:24:15.534
LAURA: One hundred.

01:24:15.567 --> 01:24:17.434
TRAVIS: I didn't roll any 'cause
I was looking through this

01:24:17.467 --> 01:24:19.974
Deck of Many Things!
90.

01:24:20.767 --> 01:24:22.033
MATT: Ninety, okay.

01:24:22.067 --> 01:24:24.741
At the end
of the short rest,

01:24:26.934 --> 01:24:30.501
Vex, you've taken the
time with the tapestry,

01:24:30.534 --> 01:24:31.934
looking at it.

01:24:31.968 --> 01:24:34.234
Its design kind of
hurts your heart a little bit

01:24:34.267 --> 01:24:37.104
'cause it reminds you of the
flying carpet that you once had

01:24:37.104 --> 01:24:39.767
and you're like
hoping and praying.

01:24:39.801 --> 01:24:42.467
And as it--as you're
concentrating on it,

01:24:42.501 --> 01:24:44.968
and hoping that
something comes to you,

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:51.567
you're like, "Fly,"
you know, "Go."

01:24:51.601 --> 01:24:53.037
"Traverse, carry."

01:24:53.037 --> 01:24:54.961
You're just throwing
all these words out.

01:24:54.961 --> 01:24:57.364
And as you're just getting
more and more exhausted,

01:24:57.364 --> 01:24:59.667
and the rest of your
party kind of look over

01:24:59.667 --> 01:25:02.067
with this, "Oh, give it up,
girl," kind of look

01:25:02.100 --> 01:25:03.701
and shaking their head,

01:25:03.734 --> 01:25:06.934
a sudden hit of
inspiration hits your mind

01:25:06.968 --> 01:25:08.901
and clarifies--the word "lift."

01:25:08.934 --> 01:25:11.834
You say lift and the tapestry
goes fll fll fll.

01:25:11.868 --> 01:25:15.280
LAURA: Shut the fucking--!

01:25:16.033 --> 01:25:17.000
You guys!

01:25:17.033 --> 01:25:19.434
VAX: (snoring)

01:25:19.467 --> 01:25:22.267
TRAVIS: It's a flying telefaphy.

01:25:22.300 --> 01:25:24.667
LAURA: Lift higher.

01:25:24.701 --> 01:25:27.297
♪ High up in love ♪♪

01:25:28.200 --> 01:25:30.367
SAM: Another flying carpet.

01:25:30.400 --> 01:25:32.234
LAURA: Oh, you guys,
this is wonderful.

01:25:32.267 --> 01:25:34.707
TALIESIN: I legitimately think this
is the one she tried to replace

01:25:34.707 --> 01:25:35.891
the one we stole.

01:25:35.891 --> 01:25:37.067
TRAVIS: Wwwaahhhhhhh.

01:25:37.100 --> 01:25:38.000
LAURA: Waahhhhhh.

01:25:38.033 --> 01:25:39.687
LIAM: It's Allura's other carpet.

01:25:39.687 --> 01:25:40.780
TALIESIN: It's her other carpet.

01:25:40.780 --> 01:25:42.860
-LAURA: Oh, shit.
-MARISHA: She collects magical carpets.

01:25:42.860 --> 01:25:45.171
TALIESIN: Well, she should
only ever needs one,

01:25:45.171 --> 01:25:47.367
we just keep taking it.

01:25:47.400 --> 01:25:49.701
SAM: Does it say
how much weight it can hold?

01:25:49.734 --> 01:25:51.133
TRAVIS: Eight hundred.

01:25:51.167 --> 01:25:52.167
LAURA: Eight hundred pounds, it can
carry more than the last one.

01:25:52.167 --> 01:25:54.534
SAM: How big is Grog?

01:25:54.534 --> 01:25:56.934
MARISHA: Ah, is it a bigger tapestry?

01:25:56.968 --> 01:25:58.067
LAURA: It's six by nine.

01:25:58.100 --> 01:25:59.300
TRAVIS: Like three hundred.

01:25:59.334 --> 01:26:00.968
LAURA: This is like the
California king version.

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:02.100
MATT: Bigger than the one
you had before, yeah.

01:26:02.133 --> 01:26:04.400
MARISHA: It's a California
king version.

01:26:04.434 --> 01:26:06.300
SAM: Grog can get on that
and go hit things.

01:26:06.334 --> 01:26:08.684
TRAVIS: Yeah flying speed of 30,
I can run faster than that.

01:26:08.684 --> 01:26:10.917
MARISHA: Can you be like a
Silver Surfer thing?

01:26:10.917 --> 01:26:12.601
TRAVIS: Blaaaaah, yeah.

01:26:12.634 --> 01:26:13.934
MARISHA: Ya!

01:26:13.968 --> 01:26:17.100
LAURA: What's my carrying
capacity on my broom?

01:26:17.133 --> 01:26:18.901
MATT: Uh...

01:26:18.934 --> 01:26:20.900
LAURA: I should probably know this.

01:26:20.900 --> 01:26:26.567
MATT: Your broom can carry, uh,
it can carry 400 pounds

01:26:26.601 --> 01:26:28.133
at a flying speed of 30.

01:26:28.167 --> 01:26:29.300
LAURA: Well good, so...

01:26:29.334 --> 01:26:31.227
MATT: Sorry, it can
carry 400 pounds,

01:26:31.227 --> 01:26:32.797
but its flying
speed becomes 30

01:26:32.797 --> 01:26:34.354
while carrying
over 200 pounds.

01:26:34.354 --> 01:26:35.300
LAURA: Okay.

01:26:35.334 --> 01:26:38.334
Oh, this is amazing.

01:26:38.367 --> 01:26:39.834
SAM: That's a good find.

01:26:39.868 --> 01:26:42.210
-TALIESIN: That's a very useful find.
-LAURA: This is some good stuff.

01:26:42.234 --> 01:26:45.200
MARISHA: Vex, does it look
like our old carpet?

01:26:45.234 --> 01:26:47.574
LAURA: I mean, it looks similar,
it's a bit bigger.

01:26:47.574 --> 01:26:50.404
MARISHA: Does it looks like they were
maybe in the same family?

01:26:50.404 --> 01:26:52.133
-LAURA: Definitely, Keyleth.
-MARISHA: Yeah?

01:26:52.167 --> 01:26:53.734
LAURA: Hey, look at
these boots,

01:26:53.734 --> 01:26:55.318
I throw them down to you.

01:26:55.318 --> 01:26:56.934
They look kind of Druidish.

01:26:56.968 --> 01:26:59.100
MARISHA: They do look Druidish.

01:26:59.133 --> 01:27:01.133
Do they look Druidish?

01:27:01.167 --> 01:27:03.934
-MATT: Roll an arcana check.
-MARISHA: Okay.

01:27:03.968 --> 01:27:06.000
♪

01:27:06.033 --> 01:27:07.300
Five.

01:27:07.334 --> 01:27:09.534
MATT: They look pretty.

01:27:09.567 --> 01:27:11.334
-MARISHA: These are so pretty!
-LAURA: I know, right?

01:27:11.367 --> 01:27:12.647
MARISHA: Oh, my gosh.

01:27:12.647 --> 01:27:14.104
LAURA: I think the color looks nice,

01:27:14.104 --> 01:27:15.718
it would look good
with your dress.

01:27:15.718 --> 01:27:17.834
MARISHA: Okay, I'll
look at these later.

01:27:17.868 --> 01:27:20.634
MATT: They're nicer than
the boots you have on.

01:27:20.667 --> 01:27:23.033
TRAVIS: Ooh, that's a diss
on your boots, dog.

01:27:23.067 --> 01:27:24.434
MARISHA: I, well...

01:27:24.467 --> 01:27:27.051
MATT: They don't necessarily
match the ensemble, per se,

01:27:27.051 --> 01:27:28.467
but they're nice boots.

01:27:28.501 --> 01:27:31.067
MARISHA: The soles are
a little melted now.

01:27:31.100 --> 01:27:32.868
LAURA: I mean basically Keyleth
would be naked this whole time

01:27:32.901 --> 01:27:35.067
'cause all of her clothes would
have burned off in the lava.

01:27:35.100 --> 01:27:37.084
MATT: This is the magical
world of fantasy

01:27:37.084 --> 01:27:39.100
in which characters don't
suddenly lose all their clothing

01:27:39.133 --> 01:27:41.767
or facial hair or body hair
because of magical spells.

01:27:41.801 --> 01:27:43.234
LAURA: All right, sure, whatever.

01:27:43.267 --> 01:27:45.501
MARISHA: Sounds like that Japanese RPG.

01:27:45.534 --> 01:27:48.264
(cross talk)

01:27:48.264 --> 01:27:50.177
MATT: I'm sure there
are RPGs out there

01:27:50.177 --> 01:27:51.400
that let you do that.

01:27:51.434 --> 01:27:53.400
I'm sure Lamentations
of the Flame Princess

01:27:53.434 --> 01:27:55.000
lets you do that.

01:27:55.033 --> 01:27:57.634
I think there's
actually some exalted

01:27:57.667 --> 01:28:00.300
expansions that let you do that.

01:28:00.334 --> 01:28:02.234
Not this game.

01:28:02.267 --> 01:28:05.200
The fan artists take
care of that for us.

01:28:05.234 --> 01:28:08.834
TALIESIN: And with that, yeah, I'd love
to take a look around the room,

01:28:08.868 --> 01:28:10.934
see if anything
captures my eye.

01:28:10.968 --> 01:28:13.297
MARISHA: I think also,
I think Keyleth's hair

01:28:13.297 --> 01:28:15.324
would probably
be shorter now again,

01:28:15.324 --> 01:28:16.714
thanks to the fire, again.

01:28:16.714 --> 01:28:18.167
MATT: Yeah, sure.

01:28:18.167 --> 01:28:20.000
LAURA: Ooh, can I fly
up on the carpet

01:28:20.033 --> 01:28:22.193
and see if anything
catches my eye from above?

01:28:22.193 --> 01:28:24.434
MATT: Sure, you can
jump up on the carpet

01:28:24.467 --> 01:28:25.901
and get an aerial view.

01:28:25.934 --> 01:28:27.634
And as you get up towards the
top if the cavern, look over.

01:28:27.667 --> 01:28:28.901
LAURA: Not that I couldn't have
done that on my broom,

01:28:28.934 --> 01:28:30.133
but I feel a little safer

01:28:30.167 --> 01:28:32.334
'cause there's
stuff all around me.

01:28:32.367 --> 01:28:34.901
MATT: Yeah, it's a nice big
square patch just for you.

01:28:34.934 --> 01:28:36.234
LAURA: I'm gonna lay down and...

01:28:36.267 --> 01:28:38.067
LIAM: Is there room for
your broom on your carpet?

01:28:38.100 --> 01:28:39.534
LAURA: Yes.

01:28:39.567 --> 01:28:41.567
TALIESIN: I'm gonna run on up there

01:28:41.601 --> 01:28:44.588
and get a vantage point 'cause
I still have some spider walk--

01:28:44.588 --> 01:28:45.701
MATT: You do, yeah.

01:28:45.734 --> 01:28:47.467
LAURA: Hop on over, Perc.

01:28:47.501 --> 01:28:50.234
MATT: So you watch as Percy
kind of walks upside down

01:28:50.267 --> 01:28:52.701
from on the cavern
and kind of gets

01:28:52.734 --> 01:28:54.200
a similar perspective as you.

01:28:54.234 --> 01:28:57.634
Make an
investigation check.

01:29:00.287 --> 01:29:02.067
-SAM: Not great.

01:29:02.100 --> 01:29:03.501
-MARISHA: That's real bad.
-TALIESIN: I can't pretend,

01:29:03.534 --> 01:29:05.634
-I can't pretend that that's--
-SAM: Real, real bad.

01:29:05.667 --> 01:29:07.634
MARISHA: That's pretty bad.

01:29:07.667 --> 01:29:09.534
TALIESIN: Why am I even bothering?

01:29:09.567 --> 01:29:10.667
Six.

01:29:10.701 --> 01:29:13.467
MATT: Yeah. In all the
time you spent here,

01:29:13.501 --> 01:29:17.701
most anything that catches
your eye beyond just value,

01:29:17.734 --> 01:29:21.601
you've managed to scavenge
and glean from the horde.

01:29:21.634 --> 01:29:25.601
Everything else seems
to be just collections

01:29:25.634 --> 01:29:30.601
of expensive or
valuable knick-knacks,

01:29:30.634 --> 01:29:33.300
collectibles, museum pieces.

01:29:33.334 --> 01:29:39.400
You know, silverware,
furniture, art pieces.

01:29:39.434 --> 01:29:42.634
Gem collections, and
then gold, silver, platinum.

01:29:42.667 --> 01:29:48.400
It's...you knowing
good amounts of money,

01:29:48.434 --> 01:29:52.200
you can't even
fathom the scope of this.

01:29:52.234 --> 01:29:53.394
Like this is...

01:29:55.367 --> 01:29:57.801
TRAVIS: Vex, you're drooling.

01:29:57.834 --> 01:30:00.544
MATT: Like millions of gold pieces.

01:30:00.544 --> 01:30:01.904
LAURA: That's a lot.

01:30:01.904 --> 01:30:04.067
TRAVIS: I feel like this
is too much for anyone--

01:30:04.067 --> 01:30:05.634
LAURA: No, no, no, it is.

01:30:05.667 --> 01:30:07.467
We need to return this
to the people of Emon,

01:30:07.501 --> 01:30:09.067
I mean, that's who
this money came from.

01:30:09.100 --> 01:30:10.534
TRAVIS: Yeah, but how do we do that?

01:30:10.567 --> 01:30:12.457
-LAURA: Yeah?
-MARISHA: Do you see anything

01:30:12.457 --> 01:30:13.834
from Greyskull in there?

01:30:13.868 --> 01:30:16.868
LAURA: Oh, do I see
anything from our keep?

01:30:16.901 --> 01:30:20.167
MATT: Nothing that stands out
or you would recognize.

01:30:20.200 --> 01:30:21.734
LAURA: Not that I can see.

01:30:21.767 --> 01:30:23.801
MARISHA: All right.

01:30:23.834 --> 01:30:26.884
TALIESIN: Now we'll, we'll take
a tithing for ourselves

01:30:26.884 --> 01:30:29.133
to help rebuild and then
everything we're gonna

01:30:29.167 --> 01:30:33.534
have to post guards and someone
is gonna have to take charge

01:30:33.567 --> 01:30:36.271
of all this, put it to a use
rebuilding the city,

01:30:36.271 --> 01:30:39.167
make sure that the antiquities
get back to the proper owners

01:30:39.200 --> 01:30:41.704
and that the money is used
to just rebuild everything.

01:30:41.704 --> 01:30:44.360
LAURA: People will have to put in
papers with the counsel.

01:30:44.360 --> 01:30:46.817
MARISHA: I was gonna say people
are gonna have to pull papers.

01:30:46.817 --> 01:30:48.700
TALIESIN: I think they're probably not
gonna get their money back,

01:30:48.700 --> 01:30:50.398
but they're at least
gonna get their--

01:30:50.398 --> 01:30:51.701
LAURA: Something.

01:30:51.734 --> 01:30:53.290
TRAVIS: Should we reward Kerr?

01:30:53.290 --> 01:30:54.934
Kerr, do you want
some of this bling?

01:30:54.968 --> 01:30:57.367
PATRICK: Actually Kerr, after
you're okay and kind of

01:30:57.400 --> 01:30:59.067
up and about yourself,

01:30:59.100 --> 01:31:03.167
probably very casually
like kind of wanders around

01:31:03.200 --> 01:31:07.000
and like when he gets
to the jewelry and the gems,

01:31:07.033 --> 01:31:10.467
like very matter
of factly fills up a sack.

01:31:11.100 --> 01:31:13.667
MARISHA: Very matter of factly.

01:31:13.701 --> 01:31:15.334
PATRICK: You know like, no like,

01:31:15.367 --> 01:31:18.100
ooh, I'm a---I feel a little
awkward about this,

01:31:18.133 --> 01:31:23.701
just like, like this is really
not my first rodeo and money.

01:31:23.734 --> 01:31:25.434
And money,
money does some--

01:31:25.467 --> 01:31:27.033
this is more
than they can carry.

01:31:27.067 --> 01:31:30.400
And, um, I have some
uses for this money.

01:31:30.434 --> 01:31:31.734
MATT: Yeah.

01:31:31.767 --> 01:31:34.000
LAURA: I did give
20 pounds of gems

01:31:34.033 --> 01:31:35.901
when we were down
in the city of Brass,

01:31:35.934 --> 01:31:37.501
maybe I can find
some more gems.

01:31:37.534 --> 01:31:38.634
MATT: Okay, yeah.

01:31:38.667 --> 01:31:41.234
TALIESIN: No, this is, we are
taking our tithing.

01:31:41.267 --> 01:31:43.713
You know taking it, we have work
that needs to be done.

01:31:43.713 --> 01:31:45.300
MATT: How much are you taking?

01:31:45.334 --> 01:31:47.167
I mean, it's your choice
really at this point.

01:31:47.200 --> 01:31:48.463
How much do you want to

01:31:48.463 --> 01:31:50.133
and how much can you carry?

01:31:50.167 --> 01:31:51.667
Do you feel
comfortable doing?

01:31:51.701 --> 01:31:55.377
LAURA: We do have a lot of, we do
have a lot of money right now.

01:31:55.377 --> 01:31:57.300
TALIESIN: We're going to be rebuilding.

01:31:57.334 --> 01:31:59.100
We need gems and platinum.

01:31:59.133 --> 01:32:01.677
Let's not take anything that
isn't gems and platinum

01:32:01.677 --> 01:32:03.667
and let's not
take a ton of it.

01:32:03.701 --> 01:32:05.614
TRAVIS: What about like big
diamonds or rubies

01:32:05.614 --> 01:32:07.334
for like important
spells and stuff?

01:32:07.367 --> 01:32:09.300
TALIESIN: A few of those
would be good.

01:32:09.334 --> 01:32:12.367
MARISHA: Gems, yeah--gems for
heroes feasts are always good.

01:32:12.400 --> 01:32:13.667
LAURA: Oh yeah, smart, smart.

01:32:13.701 --> 01:32:15.501
TALIESIN: We did burn a bunch
of them for this.

01:32:15.534 --> 01:32:17.133
LAURA: Smart, Grog.

01:32:17.167 --> 01:32:19.354
TRAVIS: I pass out
from the smartness.

01:32:19.354 --> 01:32:22.033
(laughing)

01:32:22.067 --> 01:32:24.874
MATT: As Grog falls asleep
cuddling with the gold coins.

01:32:24.874 --> 01:32:28.067
Like a slow rolling
Scrooge McDuck.

01:32:28.100 --> 01:32:30.200
(yawn)

01:32:30.234 --> 01:32:33.033
Vex, you do find--with
eight of your friends, too--

01:32:33.067 --> 01:32:35.634
there are two diamonds roughly
worth about 1,000 gold pieces

01:32:35.667 --> 01:32:38.567
that you can put off
to the side as component.

01:32:38.601 --> 01:32:41.507
You do find gems,
but really I mean,

01:32:41.507 --> 01:32:43.438
how much do you
want to take, really?

01:32:43.438 --> 01:32:44.937
This isn't how
much did you find,

01:32:44.937 --> 01:32:46.341
there's enough
here to take

01:32:46.341 --> 01:32:48.267
pretty much anything
you can carry.

01:32:48.300 --> 01:32:51.033
There's no way you can carry
even but a fraction of this,

01:32:51.067 --> 01:32:53.667
so, what do you want to take?

01:32:53.701 --> 01:32:55.267
SAM: Platinum is worth ten gold?

01:32:55.300 --> 01:32:57.701
LAURA: Yeah, so like we have--

01:32:57.734 --> 01:32:59.567
SAM: I'm taking
200 platinum for myself.

01:32:59.601 --> 01:33:01.340
MATT: Okay.

01:33:01.340 --> 01:33:03.271
TALIESIN: I think I would
actually honestly say

01:33:03.271 --> 01:33:04.917
at least 1,000
platinum in general

01:33:04.917 --> 01:33:06.868
just for general
use for the group.

01:33:06.901 --> 01:33:08.283
-MARISHA: Yeah.
-LAURA: Yeah.

01:33:08.283 --> 01:33:10.467
TALIESIN: And then ten of each
gem that we can find.

01:33:10.501 --> 01:33:13.701
LAURA: 1,000 platinum
for the group then?

01:33:13.734 --> 01:33:14.987
-MATT: Sure.
-LAURA: Okay.

01:33:14.987 --> 01:33:16.474
TALIESIN: That seems reasonable.

01:33:16.474 --> 01:33:17.667
LAURA: Yeah, totally.

01:33:17.701 --> 01:33:21.324
TALIESIN: We're also gonna need to put
somebody in charge of all this.

01:33:21.324 --> 01:33:23.934
MARISHA: Yes, someone trustworthy.

01:33:23.968 --> 01:33:25.767
PATRICK: (snoring)

01:33:25.801 --> 01:33:27.267
(laughing)

01:33:27.300 --> 01:33:29.534
TALIESIN: Oh, we know you have
things to do.

01:33:29.567 --> 01:33:30.941
TRAVIS: The guilt of it.

01:33:30.941 --> 01:33:33.367
(laughing)

01:33:35.133 --> 01:33:38.234
MARISHA: I see Kerr hesitate,
and I bend down

01:33:38.267 --> 01:33:41.968
and I pick up like
a handful of gold and say...

01:33:45.357 --> 01:33:47.901
PATRICK: No, it's more like,
it's like am I gonna

01:33:47.934 --> 01:33:49.567
be in charge of another city?

01:33:49.601 --> 01:33:52.400
LAURA: No, no, no, not
unless you want to be.

01:33:52.434 --> 01:33:57.200
PATRICK: It's, uh, but no, I grab mostly
not big gems, nothing flashy,

01:33:57.234 --> 01:34:00.367
but light, portable,
and stuff that

01:34:00.400 --> 01:34:02.367
can be converted into cash.

01:34:02.400 --> 01:34:04.901
Like, I've got troops
who are going to--

01:34:04.934 --> 01:34:08.067
and a city back home, yeah.

01:34:08.100 --> 01:34:11.634
TALIESIN: And you did come here, so.

01:34:11.667 --> 01:34:15.707
SAM: Vex, there are six,
there are seven of us.

01:34:17.701 --> 01:34:19.734
Maybe we should
take a bit more.

01:34:19.767 --> 01:34:21.367
MARISHA: I'm taking a little bit
of gold for myself

01:34:21.400 --> 01:34:23.300
just 'cause I'm low.

01:34:23.334 --> 01:34:26.824
LAURA: Yeah, if you guys want
to grab stuff yourself.

01:34:26.824 --> 01:34:29.167
MATT: Kima's abstained, by the way.

01:34:29.200 --> 01:34:31.634
Kima's not taking anything.

01:34:31.667 --> 01:34:34.033
While Gilmore is currently
filling up a small satchel,

01:34:34.067 --> 01:34:38.834
he's like, "Well, I have
to rebuild some way."

01:34:38.868 --> 01:34:41.734
Shoveling in small amounts,
but you know, not too much.

01:34:41.767 --> 01:34:43.294
LAURA: Same.

01:34:44.868 --> 01:34:49.968
I'll take...so hard.

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:52.811
TRAVIS: I'm taking 184 gold pieces.

01:34:52.811 --> 01:34:54.057
MATT: Good job, Grog.

01:34:54.057 --> 01:34:55.467
LAURA: Nice, Grog.

01:34:55.501 --> 01:34:57.000
(laughing)

01:34:57.033 --> 01:34:59.727
TALIESIN: I'm just gonna
put 500 gold pieces.

01:34:59.727 --> 01:35:01.290
SAM: Dude, that's
a million dollars.

01:35:01.290 --> 01:35:02.600
MARISHA: That's what I did
with 500.

01:35:02.600 --> 01:35:03.801
TALIESIN: 500 gold pieces.

01:35:03.834 --> 01:35:04.868
TRAVIS: Like candy or something.

01:35:04.901 --> 01:35:06.334
Jellybeans in a jar.

01:35:06.367 --> 01:35:09.467
LAURA: Fifty platinum,
so it's lighter.

01:35:09.501 --> 01:35:14.534
TALIESIN: We're going to have
to seal this cave for now.

01:35:16.634 --> 01:35:18.767
SAM: Why, the city is secured.

01:35:18.801 --> 01:35:21.501
TALIESIN: The city is secured, the
city is about to become a riot

01:35:21.534 --> 01:35:22.767
once they finish getting

01:35:22.801 --> 01:35:24.914
-everything out of here.
-LAURA: And looters will come down here

01:35:24.914 --> 01:35:26.307
and take far
more than we did.

01:35:26.307 --> 01:35:27.434
TRAVIS: No, really?

01:35:27.467 --> 01:35:29.467
SAM: Wait a second.

01:35:29.501 --> 01:35:31.634
Don't we owe The
Clasp half of this?

01:35:31.667 --> 01:35:35.567
LAURA: We owe The Clasp
half of our loot.

01:35:35.601 --> 01:35:37.000
SAM: What does that mean?

01:35:37.033 --> 01:35:40.434
MARISHA: But that's our loot,
that's not the city's.

01:35:40.467 --> 01:35:45.367
LAURA: If we don't take as much,
then we don't give them as much.

01:35:45.400 --> 01:35:47.834
SAM: I don't think they
would view it that way.

01:35:47.868 --> 01:35:49.790
TALIESIN: That's the deal they made.

01:35:49.790 --> 01:35:52.734
This is not our loot
we just looted.

01:35:52.767 --> 01:35:56.434
LAURA: It's not our money,
it's Emon's.

01:35:56.467 --> 01:35:58.367
MARISHA: The Clasp should
be aware of that.

01:35:58.400 --> 01:36:00.281
SAM: I think we're going
to make an enemy

01:36:00.281 --> 01:36:01.501
out of them by doing this.

01:36:01.534 --> 01:36:03.827
TALIESIN: I think we're going to
keep an enemy out of them

01:36:03.827 --> 01:36:04.968
is really more likely.

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:07.067
LAURA: How do we even
know who we told?

01:36:07.100 --> 01:36:08.334
It could have
been two underlings,

01:36:08.367 --> 01:36:09.834
nobody would believe
what they said anyway.

01:36:09.868 --> 01:36:12.167
TRAVIS: Sure would be a gesture in
the right direction, though.

01:36:12.200 --> 01:36:14.167
MARISHA: Well we can, I'm sure
we can still throw them

01:36:14.200 --> 01:36:16.501
a little bit
of platinum, but...

01:36:16.534 --> 01:36:17.767
I mean, Percy--

01:36:17.801 --> 01:36:19.267
SAM: What like 5,000,
is that what you're saying,

01:36:19.300 --> 01:36:21.400
half of, half
of what we take?

01:36:21.434 --> 01:36:23.133
How does this work?

01:36:23.167 --> 01:36:25.701
That's nothing to them.

01:36:25.734 --> 01:36:27.267
We promised them
untold riches.

01:36:27.300 --> 01:36:29.200
LAURA: We took 1,000 platinum
for ourselves.

01:36:29.234 --> 01:36:31.567
If we took another 1,000
and gave it to The Clasp,

01:36:31.601 --> 01:36:32.734
that's a lot of money.

01:36:32.767 --> 01:36:34.200
TRAVIS: How about we don't
give them anything

01:36:34.234 --> 01:36:36.200
and we just let them know
it's clear to come down here

01:36:36.234 --> 01:36:37.667
and deal with it as they will.

01:36:37.701 --> 01:36:39.100
SAM: They'll take everything.

01:36:39.133 --> 01:36:41.167
TALIESIN: I don't know if they'll
take everything, actually.

01:36:41.200 --> 01:36:44.534
MARISHA: Well, Percy, you once
said that every good city

01:36:44.567 --> 01:36:46.067
needs a good underbelly.

01:36:46.100 --> 01:36:47.634
TALIESIN: That's true.

01:36:47.667 --> 01:36:50.167
MARISHA: I imagine that
the underbelly would also

01:36:50.200 --> 01:36:52.968
have a vested interest
in a having good city,

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:54.434
I imagine it
works both ways, right?

01:36:54.467 --> 01:36:55.968
TALIESIN: I'm so proud
of you right now.

01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:57.267
MARISHA: Yeah, thank you.

01:36:57.300 --> 01:36:58.501
TALIESIN: Oh my God.

01:36:58.534 --> 01:37:00.100
MARISHA: I'm learning from you,
just like a little,

01:37:00.133 --> 01:37:01.534
-where it's appropriate.
-TALIESIN: I'm so sorry,

01:37:01.567 --> 01:37:03.000
-but I'm so proud.
-MARISHA: Only where it's appropriate.

01:37:03.033 --> 01:37:04.267
TRAVIS: So what is it,
we hand deliver it

01:37:04.300 --> 01:37:05.868
or we just let them know
it's clear to come down?

01:37:05.901 --> 01:37:08.701
SAM: Hand deliver, we don't want
them coming here at all.

01:37:08.734 --> 01:37:10.033
TRAVIS: I agree, it's more personal.

01:37:10.067 --> 01:37:13.000
You write the limerick and
we give them two platinum.

01:37:13.033 --> 01:37:14.367
(laughing)

01:37:14.400 --> 01:37:15.901
What was the number you said?

01:37:15.934 --> 01:37:18.334
LAURA: That two is what I said, yes.

01:37:18.367 --> 01:37:22.067
PATRICK: Send them an envelope
with half of the deck in it.

01:37:22.100 --> 01:37:24.537
(gasps)

01:37:24.537 --> 01:37:26.667
TRAVIS: It just turns into swords--

01:37:26.701 --> 01:37:29.501
TALIESIN: How are you the cruelest
human I've ever--oh, my.

01:37:29.534 --> 01:37:30.601
That's amazing.

01:37:30.634 --> 01:37:32.890
LAURA: I don't know what
the deck can do.

01:37:32.890 --> 01:37:36.968
Could it, could it cause
the entire city to crumble?

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:38.300
Potentially?

01:37:42.267 --> 01:37:43.367
Ooh.

01:37:43.400 --> 01:37:44.434
PATRICK: That, I do not know.

01:37:44.467 --> 01:37:45.787
TALIESIN: We can give them the deck.

01:37:45.787 --> 01:37:46.934
LIAM: Vax just woke up.

01:37:46.968 --> 01:37:49.400
MATT: Hi, Vax, welcome back.

01:37:49.434 --> 01:37:51.567
TRAVIS: So, what, five
thousand platinum?

01:37:51.601 --> 01:37:53.000
SAM: Five thousand platinum.

01:37:53.033 --> 01:37:55.234
LAURA: Why five tho--where are you
coming up with these numbers?

01:37:55.267 --> 01:37:58.234
MARISHA: You literally said
different numbers every time.

01:37:58.267 --> 01:38:00.501
TRAVIS: We could give them like
three pizza platinum,

01:38:00.534 --> 01:38:01.767
it doesn't
really matter to me,

01:38:01.801 --> 01:38:03.100
I just want to go.

01:38:03.133 --> 01:38:04.300
-LIAM: Hey, big man?
-TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:38:04.334 --> 01:38:05.634
LIAM: That's a nice sword,
where did you get that?

01:38:05.667 --> 01:38:07.911
TRAVIS: I took out a card
of this little pouch

01:38:07.911 --> 01:38:09.643
and it turned into this thing.

01:38:09.643 --> 01:38:11.367
LIAM: What are you talking about?

01:38:11.400 --> 01:38:13.850
TRAVIS: Yeah, it was like a little card
in like a leather pouch

01:38:13.850 --> 01:38:15.431
and then Vex took it from me

01:38:15.431 --> 01:38:18.367
'cause apparently
I make too many weapons.

01:38:18.400 --> 01:38:21.400
SAM: If we want them
to be our allies,

01:38:21.434 --> 01:38:23.667
and not hate us
and try to kill us,

01:38:23.701 --> 01:38:26.701
we have to give them
a good amount of money.

01:38:26.734 --> 01:38:27.901
LIAM: What, The Clasp?

01:38:27.934 --> 01:38:28.801
SAM: Yes.

01:38:28.834 --> 01:38:30.300
LIAM: We're talking about payment.

01:38:30.334 --> 01:38:33.334
LAURA: We give them 1,000 platinum and
say that's half of what we took.

01:38:33.367 --> 01:38:35.934
LIAM: Oh, they're a crime syndicate,
they're gonna laugh at that.

01:38:35.968 --> 01:38:37.367
SAM: I agree.

01:38:37.400 --> 01:38:41.567
PATRICK: And they know when someone's
running a game on them.

01:38:41.601 --> 01:38:44.167
LAURA: But we didn't take any more,
that's our loot.

01:38:44.200 --> 01:38:46.634
SAM: That's not how
they're gonna see this.

01:38:46.667 --> 01:38:48.547
LIAM: That's a letter
of the law argument,

01:38:48.547 --> 01:38:50.334
they're gonna want
to go spirit.

01:38:50.367 --> 01:38:55.317
MARISHA: We also just saved their
city from utter destruction.

01:38:55.317 --> 01:38:57.501
TRAVIS: Honestly, are we
gonna stay around

01:38:57.534 --> 01:39:00.234
and really regulate what happens
here, we're not, right?

01:39:00.267 --> 01:39:01.467
We've got shit to do.

01:39:01.501 --> 01:39:02.968
TALIESIN: I would honestly say,

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:05.901
and I cannot believe
that I'm agreeing to this,

01:39:05.934 --> 01:39:07.601
but I think just
if we run into them,

01:39:07.634 --> 01:39:09.737
we let them know
that the dragon's dead

01:39:09.737 --> 01:39:11.801
and that's where it is.

01:39:11.834 --> 01:39:13.567
TRAVIS: I'm with Percy.

01:39:13.601 --> 01:39:15.000
TALIESIN: They're not gonna
bankrupt the city,

01:39:15.033 --> 01:39:16.701
it's not in
their best interests.

01:39:16.734 --> 01:39:17.934
They're gonna
take a look at it

01:39:17.968 --> 01:39:20.000
and they're gonna get
what they can carry.

01:39:22.367 --> 01:39:25.000
SAM: So we're turning over the city
and the city's treasury

01:39:25.033 --> 01:39:26.467
to a bunch of thieves.

01:39:26.501 --> 01:39:28.434
TALIESIN: We turned over the city
to a bunch of thieves,

01:39:28.467 --> 01:39:29.901
they've basically
been running the place

01:39:29.934 --> 01:39:32.534
for the past few months.

01:39:32.567 --> 01:39:34.200
PATRICK: How small town am I?

01:39:34.234 --> 01:39:35.787
Do I know about these folks?

01:39:35.787 --> 01:39:38.133
MATT: You've never dealt
with them directly

01:39:38.167 --> 01:39:42.534
other than scaring off a
couple of younger cutthroats

01:39:42.567 --> 01:39:44.701
you caught in like
an alleyway here or there.

01:39:44.734 --> 01:39:46.491
But you're aware of The Clasp.

01:39:46.491 --> 01:39:48.868
The Clasp, while
largely centered in Emon,

01:39:48.901 --> 01:39:51.567
is a syndicate that is
across all Tal'Dorei

01:39:51.601 --> 01:39:54.434
and has some hand in every
village no matter how small.

01:39:54.467 --> 01:39:56.400
PATRICK: Right.

01:39:56.434 --> 01:39:58.434
LAURA: Maybe we let them
know that it's there,

01:39:58.467 --> 01:40:00.000
but that the
guards are coming.

01:40:00.033 --> 01:40:01.334
They won't have
a lot of time.

01:40:01.367 --> 01:40:04.634
MARISHA: Why don't we just hand
this over to someone else

01:40:04.667 --> 01:40:06.000
and let them handle it?

01:40:06.033 --> 01:40:08.601
PATRICK: If you hand it
over to someone else,

01:40:08.601 --> 01:40:11.567
and send them a letter, it
will take a while to get there.

01:40:11.601 --> 01:40:13.267
SAM: The Clasp?

01:40:13.300 --> 01:40:15.887
They're down the hallway.

01:40:15.887 --> 01:40:16.968
PATRICK: Which one?

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:18.534
TRAVIS: Over yonder.

01:40:18.567 --> 01:40:20.968
SAM: They're in the sewers
1,000 meters from here.

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:22.834
PATRICK: Oh.

01:40:24.847 --> 01:40:26.868
MARISHA: Regardless,
I agree with Grog.

01:40:26.901 --> 01:40:30.200
We have more important things
to worry about right now.

01:40:30.234 --> 01:40:31.910
TRAVIS: I'm running for office.

01:40:31.910 --> 01:40:34.701
SAM: T-shirt: Regardless,
I agree with Grog.

01:40:34.734 --> 01:40:37.968
(laughing)

01:40:40.200 --> 01:40:43.567
MARISHA: Things never
been said before.

01:40:43.601 --> 01:40:46.033
PATRICK: Is there any of
the people collected,

01:40:46.067 --> 01:40:47.601
the generals or whatever,

01:40:47.634 --> 01:40:49.934
have you worked
with them as well?

01:40:49.968 --> 01:40:51.000
LAURA: The Clasp or the--

01:40:51.033 --> 01:40:55.033
PATRICK: No, the former
leaders of this city,

01:40:55.067 --> 01:40:56.868
any of the people
that you've--

01:40:56.901 --> 01:40:59.100
SAM: The military, we can put
them in charge of this.

01:40:59.133 --> 01:41:01.534
TALIESIN: There's not
really any military.

01:41:01.567 --> 01:41:03.534
SAM: There's a visiting army.

01:41:03.567 --> 01:41:04.834
Yeah, we can put
them in charge of it,

01:41:04.868 --> 01:41:06.167
at least temporarily.

01:41:06.200 --> 01:41:07.367
They can be trusted.

01:41:07.400 --> 01:41:08.467
TALIESIN: Can they?

01:41:08.501 --> 01:41:12.567
LIAM: Kima, do you feel
like keeping an eye

01:41:12.601 --> 01:41:17.133
on a small group of
soldiers from Syngorn?

01:41:17.167 --> 01:41:18.387
Protecting this?

01:41:18.387 --> 01:41:19.670
A few days?

01:41:19.670 --> 01:41:22.334
MATT: "I could probably run it,
I'd probably have to go

01:41:22.367 --> 01:41:23.767
and check in with Allie.

01:41:23.801 --> 01:41:26.227
I'm sure she'd be interested
in knowing about this

01:41:26.227 --> 01:41:28.033
since she's, you know,
part of the council."

01:41:28.067 --> 01:41:29.467
LAURA: Right, we need to tell her.

01:41:29.501 --> 01:41:33.767
MATT: "We have Asum--I mean
we still have a number

01:41:33.801 --> 01:41:35.367
of standing council members

01:41:35.400 --> 01:41:37.200
and there's a few we still
haven't accounted for."

01:41:37.234 --> 01:41:38.067
LIAM: This is your home.

01:41:38.100 --> 01:41:39.200
TALIESIN: That would be better.

01:41:39.234 --> 01:41:41.430
MATT: "My home is Westruun,
to be honest,

01:41:41.430 --> 01:41:44.467
but I've kind of taken
this as a second home."

01:41:44.501 --> 01:41:47.734
TALIESIN: Far more stories of treasures
being looted by foreigners.

01:41:47.767 --> 01:41:50.667
LAURA: Honestly, we need to get to
Whitestone, speaking of.

01:41:50.701 --> 01:41:53.138
TRAVIS: Yeah, don't we need
to like get a hand

01:41:53.138 --> 01:41:55.567
and plant it under a tree
or something like that?

01:41:55.601 --> 01:41:57.501
LAURA: Yes.

01:41:57.534 --> 01:41:58.220
Yes.

01:41:58.220 --> 01:41:59.530
SAM: Forgot about that.

01:41:59.530 --> 01:42:00.767
TALIESIN: We have a hand.

01:42:00.801 --> 01:42:02.104
MARISHA: We have a hand.

01:42:02.104 --> 01:42:03.934
LAURA: We have ashes to
bury in Vasselheim.

01:42:03.968 --> 01:42:05.167
MARISHA: We have a lot to do.

01:42:05.200 --> 01:42:06.868
LAURA: We have to find out
where the fuck Raishan is.

01:42:06.901 --> 01:42:08.834
Can we see if maybe
she went to Whitestone

01:42:08.868 --> 01:42:10.634
and the whole city's decimated?

01:42:10.667 --> 01:42:14.000
MARISHA: I can try and scry
with the scrying eye,

01:42:14.033 --> 01:42:16.033
but that's it.

01:42:16.067 --> 01:42:18.351
TRAVIS: How about we go to
Whitestone and then scry?

01:42:18.351 --> 01:42:20.767
SAM: Well, we won't need
to if we're there.

01:42:20.801 --> 01:42:22.167
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:42:22.200 --> 01:42:23.968
LAURA: Just find out
if it's all right.

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:25.743
TALIESIN: Let's crawl upstairs.

01:42:25.743 --> 01:42:28.100
Let's keep some
people on this, Kima,

01:42:28.133 --> 01:42:29.968
and we'll crawl upstairs.

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:31.334
MARISHA: I can try to scry on Rai--

01:42:31.367 --> 01:42:35.367
Did I find a little, like a
scale of hers, by the way?

01:42:35.400 --> 01:42:37.901
MATT: Glancing about, uh...
roll an investigation check

01:42:37.934 --> 01:42:39.434
specifically
looking for the scale.

01:42:39.467 --> 01:42:41.734
As opposed to looking for
other things about the room.

01:42:41.767 --> 01:42:44.701
TALIESIN: That's crock, that's--
yeah, I know.

01:42:44.734 --> 01:42:46.100
MARISHA: That's slightly better.

01:42:46.133 --> 01:42:47.934
Uh, ten total.

01:42:47.968 --> 01:42:51.734
MATT: Ten total? It takes
you about ten minutes

01:42:51.767 --> 01:42:56.667
and because the
shifting low light in here

01:42:56.701 --> 01:43:00.300
the rocky formations
of the ground itself,

01:43:00.334 --> 01:43:04.467
you're having a hard time
finding any scales of Raishan's.

01:43:04.501 --> 01:43:06.834
MARISHA: Anything, blood?

01:43:06.868 --> 01:43:08.901
MATT: It takes you about
15 or 20 minutes

01:43:08.934 --> 01:43:11.334
before you actually
find a small cluster.

01:43:11.367 --> 01:43:15.400
From one of the wounds
left behind by Grog.

01:43:15.434 --> 01:43:17.100
MARISHA: Yeah, that'll do it, yeah.

01:43:17.133 --> 01:43:19.400
TALIESIN: I'm gonna
grab the bag of colding

01:43:19.434 --> 01:43:23.267
and take samples of the
dragon eggs that we cracked,

01:43:23.300 --> 01:43:28.447
the fluid, the bodies, like I'll
put the whole thing in there.

01:43:30.601 --> 01:43:32.200
We need that.

01:43:32.234 --> 01:43:34.234
PATRICK: They intend?

01:43:34.267 --> 01:43:38.267
-They took the body--
-LAURA: Raishan?

01:43:38.300 --> 01:43:44.100
LIAM: She, uh, no, no, she's been
playing us for a long time.

01:43:44.133 --> 01:43:47.033
We were in a loose
agreement with her

01:43:47.067 --> 01:43:49.701
to get to today
and we've never felt

01:43:49.734 --> 01:43:52.834
like she's told us
the whole picture.

01:43:52.868 --> 01:43:56.434
Uh, we have watched her
gas scores of people

01:43:56.467 --> 01:43:58.601
in front of us.

01:43:58.634 --> 01:44:03.200
She's killed many
of your friends.

01:44:03.234 --> 01:44:04.667
She's not good.

01:44:04.701 --> 01:44:09.634
But no, we don't ultimately
know what her next move is.

01:44:09.667 --> 01:44:13.501
MARISHA: I can try to scry on her
and maybe get lucky

01:44:13.534 --> 01:44:16.901
or I can try and
scry on Whitestone.

01:44:16.934 --> 01:44:19.033
The problem is
is she's smart,

01:44:19.067 --> 01:44:20.434
so even if I try
and scry on her,

01:44:20.467 --> 01:44:22.767
there's a possibility
that she'll resist it.

01:44:22.801 --> 01:44:26.667
TALIESIN: She's exhausted still,
I would assume.

01:44:26.701 --> 01:44:28.714
MARISHA: She did burn all of her
legendary resistance,

01:44:28.714 --> 01:44:30.534
-didn't she?
-MATT: She did.

01:44:30.567 --> 01:44:33.033
TALIESIN: And she's
probably been running.

01:44:33.067 --> 01:44:34.267
LIAM: What could it hurt?

01:44:34.300 --> 01:44:36.334
MARISHA: I'm gonna try
and scry on Raishan.

01:44:36.367 --> 01:44:37.968
MATT: Okay, casting the spell?

01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:39.267
MARISHA: Scrying eye.

01:44:39.300 --> 01:44:41.501
MATT: Scrying eye, okay the reason,
the item's DC,

01:44:41.534 --> 01:44:42.767
not your spell DC.

01:44:42.801 --> 01:44:44.567
MARISHA: I guess so, but I
don't know if you ever put

01:44:44.601 --> 01:44:50.801
the scrying eye DC on here,
it doesn't have a DC.

01:44:50.834 --> 01:44:54.367
MATT: It doesn't--then, uh, then
we'll use your spell DC,

01:44:54.400 --> 01:44:57.000
that's fine, okay, so.

01:44:57.033 --> 01:44:59.501
So as you guys
begin situating,

01:44:59.534 --> 01:45:02.901
Kima walks up at the surface.

01:45:02.934 --> 01:45:05.234
Gilmore's still kind
of rummaging through

01:45:05.267 --> 01:45:06.667
and trying to find some
interesting things.

01:45:06.701 --> 01:45:09.400
And there's a few moments when
you hear Gilmore across from you

01:45:09.434 --> 01:45:13.601
like, "Hah, hah,
this is mine."

01:45:13.634 --> 01:45:16.100
Starting to find things left
over from his destroyed shop

01:45:16.133 --> 01:45:17.367
that have been
scavenged by looters

01:45:17.400 --> 01:45:20.367
and brought back to
Thordak as, you know,

01:45:20.400 --> 01:45:23.501
paying homage to
their new ruler.

01:45:23.534 --> 01:45:25.300
Um, Kima begins to head up

01:45:25.334 --> 01:45:28.701
and you can hear now people
have begun to gather en masse

01:45:28.734 --> 01:45:30.767
into the Cloudtop
it sounds like other--

01:45:30.801 --> 01:45:33.801
the rest of your soldiers
along with Zahra and Kashaw

01:45:33.834 --> 01:45:36.270
are walking up with her
and begin to organize

01:45:36.270 --> 01:45:39.033
and find whoever's been
fighting through the city

01:45:39.067 --> 01:45:43.467
and figuring out how to set up a
perimeter to defend the center

01:45:43.501 --> 01:45:45.923
which essentially the entire
economy of the city

01:45:45.923 --> 01:45:48.467
lies underground.

01:45:48.501 --> 01:45:50.367
You begin to pull
out the scrying eye

01:45:50.400 --> 01:45:53.534
and set up the small
space for the ritual.

01:45:53.567 --> 01:45:56.367
You concentrate on it and
kind of thrust your vision

01:45:56.400 --> 01:45:59.934
towards the center
of the artifact.

01:45:59.968 --> 01:46:01.701
What's the spell DC?

01:46:01.734 --> 01:46:03.801
MARISHA: My spell save DC is 20.

01:46:10.300 --> 01:46:13.067
MATT: All right.

01:46:13.100 --> 01:46:18.901
So as you focus, you feel
your vision kind of lift up

01:46:18.934 --> 01:46:22.200
into the dark clouds
as the storm is drifting

01:46:22.234 --> 01:46:24.634
south--south east of the city

01:46:24.667 --> 01:46:29.667
towards where the wyvern
riders have been escaping.

01:46:29.701 --> 01:46:31.934
Into the clouds and the dark,
the moisture, the rain,

01:46:31.968 --> 01:46:35.133
you feel the humidity
almost oppressive against you

01:46:35.167 --> 01:46:38.567
and you feel your
essence being tugged,

01:46:38.601 --> 01:46:40.497
being pulled rapidly
in a direction.

01:46:40.497 --> 01:46:42.601
Amidst the cloud, you don't
know which direction it is,

01:46:42.634 --> 01:46:43.701
but it's pulled you quickly

01:46:43.734 --> 01:46:46.421
and suddenly you
emerge from the clouds

01:46:46.421 --> 01:46:47.767
and you're over ocean.

01:46:47.801 --> 01:46:50.567
Um, over ocean you
see in the distance

01:46:50.601 --> 01:46:54.667
just open waves,
no signs of land, just water.

01:46:54.701 --> 01:46:58.047
And then a singular island,
isolated, distant,

01:46:58.047 --> 01:46:59.200
far from everything.

01:46:59.234 --> 01:47:00.734
Your vision suddenly jumps,

01:47:00.767 --> 01:47:03.434
scats upright to the outside
of this cavern opening.

01:47:03.467 --> 01:47:07.234
You see--
skips, I meant to say.

01:47:07.267 --> 01:47:09.567
Nothing escapes Laura's mind.

01:47:09.601 --> 01:47:12.033
She is our
resident 13-year-old.

01:47:12.067 --> 01:47:13.934
-LIAM: It was me that time.
-LAURA: It was actually him.

01:47:13.968 --> 01:47:16.534
-It was him that time.
-MATT: You're twins, that's fine.

01:47:16.567 --> 01:47:17.734
LIAM: Poopy.

01:47:17.767 --> 01:47:19.067
MATT: Yes.

01:47:19.100 --> 01:47:22.467
Skips ahead to the
exterior of some sort of

01:47:22.501 --> 01:47:25.501
a mountain based cavern
that dips deep into the ground

01:47:25.534 --> 01:47:29.968
in the center of this very,
very thick jungle-like terrain.

01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:34.067
You can see portions
of the cavern here

01:47:34.100 --> 01:47:35.667
have been ruined
and broken down

01:47:35.701 --> 01:47:41.234
and there appears to be some
sort of geothermal activity

01:47:41.267 --> 01:47:42.267
in the vicinity.

01:47:42.300 --> 01:47:44.834
Your vision skips again
and you can see

01:47:44.868 --> 01:47:46.934
a deep series
of winding caverns

01:47:46.968 --> 01:47:50.501
that lead to what
looks to be like a stone--

01:47:50.534 --> 01:47:57.400
a very, very old
stone laboratory.

01:47:57.434 --> 01:47:58.467
You see cages.

01:47:58.501 --> 01:48:01.200
You see wooden furniture.

01:48:01.234 --> 01:48:05.234
You see what look to
be portions of bookshelves

01:48:05.267 --> 01:48:06.868
that are toppled over.

01:48:06.901 --> 01:48:11.544
And out of the blurry peripheral
of this one focal point

01:48:11.544 --> 01:48:13.400
where the spell
has taken you,

01:48:13.434 --> 01:48:16.701
you can see what looks
to be just out of sight,

01:48:16.734 --> 01:48:21.767
a large deep red crimson mass
that is just resting still.

01:48:23.501 --> 01:48:27.267
You also see what appear to be
to your other peripheral,

01:48:27.300 --> 01:48:33.801
two ovoid-like red shapes that
are kind of resting in the edge.

01:48:33.834 --> 01:48:37.701
And there at one
of the bookshelves

01:48:37.734 --> 01:48:42.400
you see a woman
with long dark green hair.

01:48:42.434 --> 01:48:45.400
Um, wounded and bleeding.

01:48:45.434 --> 01:48:49.367
Currently pulling books out
of the shelf and opening them

01:48:49.400 --> 01:48:52.868
and looking through and slamming
it closed and throwing it down

01:48:52.901 --> 01:48:55.534
and pulling another
book and going through.

01:48:55.567 --> 01:49:03.033
♪

01:49:03.067 --> 01:49:05.534
The vision recedes and your eyes
blink and come back to you

01:49:05.567 --> 01:49:07.634
and you're back
in the cavern of the lair.

01:49:07.667 --> 01:49:09.267
MARISHA: She's not in Whitestone.

01:49:09.300 --> 01:49:11.567
SAM: She was looking for the
third book of the trilogy

01:49:11.601 --> 01:49:13.133
of Patrick Rothfuss--

01:49:13.167 --> 01:49:18.033
(laughing)

01:49:21.734 --> 01:49:25.033
It couldn't be
found anywhere!

01:49:25.067 --> 01:49:28.968
Why can't I find
this fucking book?

01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:32.667
(laughing)

01:49:35.767 --> 01:49:37.684
MATT: And with that
we'll take our break.

01:49:37.684 --> 01:49:39.200
(cheering)

01:49:39.234 --> 01:49:40.567
That's your break, we'll--

01:49:40.601 --> 01:49:42.601
(laughing)

01:49:46.230 --> 01:49:48.200
Alright, we'll be back
here in a few minutes,

01:49:48.234 --> 01:49:49.601
take a restroom break
and a snack break,

01:49:49.634 --> 01:49:51.267
we'll see you
guys here shortly.

01:49:51.300 --> 01:49:52.400
Stay tuned.

01:49:52.434 --> 01:49:54.167
(laughing)

01:50:54.367 --> 01:58:20.801
♪

01:59:50.968 --> 02:03:36.934
♪

02:06:41.434 --> 02:06:44.167
Welcome back, ladies and
gentlemen, to Critical Role.

02:06:44.200 --> 02:06:47.200
(laughing)

02:06:49.767 --> 02:06:52.467
Well done, Liam, well done.

02:06:52.501 --> 02:06:56.100
(indistinct remarks)

02:06:56.133 --> 02:06:58.434
So welcome back.

02:06:58.467 --> 02:07:02.501
Jumping back into our adventure.

02:07:02.534 --> 02:07:06.067
(laughing)

02:07:06.100 --> 02:07:09.267
So as the armies
begin to filter in,

02:07:09.300 --> 02:07:13.234
word begins to spread
throughout the city that

02:07:13.267 --> 02:07:17.100
every Fire Giant that
stood beneath Thordak

02:07:17.133 --> 02:07:20.534
in the city has been slain.

02:07:20.567 --> 02:07:24.400
A multitude of the lizardfolk
that were under Thordak

02:07:24.434 --> 02:07:27.300
and the Conclaves barrier
have also been slain

02:07:27.334 --> 02:07:30.300
or have fled the city.

02:07:30.334 --> 02:07:33.434
The storm of the Ashari
has wandered and dissipated

02:07:33.467 --> 02:07:36.801
as the immediate threat
of the wyvern riding horde

02:07:36.834 --> 02:07:40.868
has fled towards the Stormcrest
Mountains to the Southeast,

02:07:40.901 --> 02:07:43.467
and are now out of sight.

02:07:43.501 --> 02:07:46.000
The armies have converged

02:07:46.033 --> 02:07:48.567
and have begun
searching for survivors

02:07:48.601 --> 02:07:51.467
and putting them
under their care.

02:07:51.501 --> 02:07:53.534
Members of the Clasp
have begun to rise up

02:07:53.567 --> 02:07:57.367
and meet with the
remaining armies

02:07:57.400 --> 02:08:00.701
in discussions of how to bring
most of the survivors out

02:08:00.734 --> 02:08:03.501
as the Clasp has actually been--
as they discussed before--

02:08:03.534 --> 02:08:06.300
taking many of the survivors
that aren't already bound

02:08:06.334 --> 02:08:10.000
to Thordak and keeping
them underground,

02:08:10.033 --> 02:08:13.234
and kind of building small
underground tent cities

02:08:13.267 --> 02:08:16.033
for them to live in while they
try and figure out what to do.

02:08:16.067 --> 02:08:18.167
It's very interesting
with those of you

02:08:18.200 --> 02:08:20.000
who've lived in Emon
for enough time

02:08:20.033 --> 02:08:22.300
to see so many different people

02:08:22.334 --> 02:08:23.868
and so many different
racial backgrounds,

02:08:23.901 --> 02:08:27.067
and so many different
cultural decrees

02:08:27.100 --> 02:08:31.133
all coming to one point
and all working together

02:08:31.167 --> 02:08:34.133
so quickly and so strongly
just for the sake

02:08:34.167 --> 02:08:38.634
of recovery, for aid and
there is an air of relief.

02:08:38.667 --> 02:08:41.234
Some people are gathering
the dead and identifying them,

02:08:41.267 --> 02:08:43.934
bringing them out into portions
of the streets to make sure

02:08:43.968 --> 02:08:47.167
that they are properly buried

02:08:47.200 --> 02:08:50.213
and the families are
given notification.

02:08:50.213 --> 02:08:52.734
You can see a lot of the
fires are being put out

02:08:52.767 --> 02:08:54.874
and people are doing the
best they can to salvage

02:08:54.874 --> 02:08:57.133
as much of the city
that still stands.

02:08:57.167 --> 02:08:59.334
And a lot of the city
still stands untouched.

02:08:59.367 --> 02:09:01.434
I'd say a good third
of it is gonna need

02:09:01.467 --> 02:09:04.501
some serious reconstruction
and rebuilding.

02:09:04.534 --> 02:09:07.248
And being one of the largest--
if not the largest city

02:09:07.248 --> 02:09:10.501
on the continent, it's
gonna take some time.

02:09:10.534 --> 02:09:12.234
You guys have begun

02:09:12.267 --> 02:09:16.801
to speak with the Warmaster

02:09:16.834 --> 02:09:19.033
as he approaches with his army,

02:09:19.067 --> 02:09:22.501
and kind of trade stories

02:09:22.534 --> 02:09:25.767
on what has transpired
on their end and yours.

02:09:25.801 --> 02:09:28.267
And as this is happening,

02:09:28.300 --> 02:09:32.133
a familiar face steps
into the district

02:09:32.167 --> 02:09:36.000
with a small group
of cloaked figures.

02:09:36.033 --> 02:09:37.701
LAURA: Oh shit.

02:09:37.734 --> 02:09:41.033
MATT: Standing before you,
you see a tall,

02:09:41.067 --> 02:09:44.234
scaled female Dragonborn,

02:09:44.267 --> 02:09:46.601
tailless, armored,

02:09:46.634 --> 02:09:48.667
Tofor Brotorus,

02:09:48.701 --> 02:09:51.033
looking harried and exhausted.

02:09:51.067 --> 02:09:53.534
She steps up and you
see what looks to be

02:09:53.567 --> 02:09:56.901
the cusp of a toothy grin

02:09:56.934 --> 02:09:59.801
at the edge of her mouth as
she catches your attention,

02:09:59.834 --> 02:10:03.167
raises one hand.

02:10:03.200 --> 02:10:06.100
"You have no idea how happy I am

02:10:06.133 --> 02:10:10.033
to see that you all live.

02:10:10.067 --> 02:10:13.567
So, if I'm to be told,
you are the ones

02:10:13.601 --> 02:10:16.534
that took down the Cinder King?"

02:10:16.567 --> 02:10:18.501
-TRAVIS: Yeah.
-TALIESIN: Yes.

02:10:18.534 --> 02:10:23.100
MARISHA: Us and with the aid of
many others, of course.

02:10:23.133 --> 02:10:26.694
MATT: "Then this is indeed
the turning point.

02:10:26.694 --> 02:10:29.667
Do you have access to any
of the members of the council?

02:10:29.701 --> 02:10:31.868
We've been cut off in
the Lyceum for months."

02:10:31.901 --> 02:10:33.767
-TRAVIS: Aye.
-LAURA: Yes.

02:10:33.801 --> 02:10:36.801
MARISHA: Allura is safe is
Whitestone currently.

02:10:36.834 --> 02:10:38.868
We can say Whitestone now right?

02:10:38.901 --> 02:10:40.801
-TALIESIN: We can say Whitestone now, yes.
-MARISHA: Okay.

02:10:40.834 --> 02:10:44.567
-She's safe in Whitestone.
-TRAVIS: Whitestone.

02:10:44.601 --> 02:10:47.367
-Sorry, are we not saying it?
-MARISHA: Whitestone, yeah.

02:10:47.400 --> 02:10:48.667
It's kinda nice saying it again.

02:10:48.701 --> 02:10:50.701
LAURA: Emperor Uriel's
wife and children

02:10:50.734 --> 02:10:52.701
are in Whitestone as well.

02:10:52.734 --> 02:10:55.424
MATT: "This is good to know,
I was worried about them

02:10:55.424 --> 02:10:57.701
after the initial attack.

02:10:57.734 --> 02:11:00.334
Okay, all right."

02:11:00.367 --> 02:11:03.901
MARISHA: Asum should still be
here as well, right?

02:11:03.934 --> 02:11:06.033
-TALIESIN: Back in Whitestone as well.
-MARISHA: Also back in Whitestone?

02:11:06.067 --> 02:11:08.133
SAM: Mhm, Whitestone.
I think--wait,

02:11:08.167 --> 02:11:10.901
Raishan was supposed
to take Asum somewhere.

02:11:10.934 --> 02:11:13.400
Did we ever--
did that ever happen?

02:11:13.434 --> 02:11:15.868
TRAVIS: I thought Asum came
down to the Ziggurat.

02:11:15.901 --> 02:11:18.634
-MARISHA: Yeah.
-SAM: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:11:18.667 --> 02:11:21.200
MARISHA: Raishan brought Asum back to us.

02:11:21.234 --> 02:11:25.367
-LAURA: Yeah, that.
-LIAM: Sound of confidence.

02:11:25.400 --> 02:11:28.100
-TALIESIN: It was like a month ago.
-MATT: "Very well.

02:11:28.133 --> 02:11:31.167
With Warmaster's aid, and
any of you who are able to,

02:11:31.200 --> 02:11:33.467
we'll begin to do
the best we can

02:11:33.501 --> 02:11:35.434
to restructure some semblance

02:11:35.467 --> 02:11:37.434
of law and order
here within the city."

02:11:37.467 --> 02:11:40.000
MARISHA: And Kima's in there,
she's kind of guarding

02:11:40.033 --> 02:11:43.601
the treasury, if you will.

02:11:43.634 --> 02:11:46.634
-SAM: Solo.
-MARISHA: Solo, by herself.

02:11:46.667 --> 02:11:49.400
LIAM: We were hoping to peel
off some of the troops,

02:11:49.434 --> 02:11:51.601
maybe some of Syngorn's
troops to help

02:11:51.634 --> 02:11:54.200
keep an eye on things in there.

02:11:54.234 --> 02:11:57.634
MATT: "Well, master, could
you make that happen?"

02:11:57.667 --> 02:12:01.434
You see Mikael Daxio
who is currently

02:12:01.467 --> 02:12:03.467
in the midst of giving orders
to a few of his soldiers

02:12:03.501 --> 02:12:05.367
kind of puts his hand
up and walks over.

02:12:05.400 --> 02:12:08.434
"I'm sorry, what?"

02:12:08.467 --> 02:12:10.501
"Mikael, if you would be able

02:12:10.534 --> 02:12:13.567
to offer some aid or
strength of your troops

02:12:13.601 --> 02:12:16.601
to guard what remains

02:12:16.634 --> 02:12:19.834
of the city's economy."

02:12:19.868 --> 02:12:21.734
And Mikael nods.

02:12:21.767 --> 02:12:22.801
"Should not be a worry.

02:12:22.834 --> 02:12:24.434
Of course, I'll uh--"

02:12:24.467 --> 02:12:26.167
and he begins to
talk with Tofor,

02:12:26.200 --> 02:12:27.701
and they begin to break
down and structure

02:12:27.734 --> 02:12:29.033
how people are gonna
go here and there.

02:12:29.067 --> 02:12:31.667
So the longer this progresses,
the more it gets

02:12:31.701 --> 02:12:33.907
into more logistical
conversations.

02:12:33.907 --> 02:12:35.601
What do you guys wanna do?

02:12:35.634 --> 02:12:39.657
MARISHA: I fill them in on
what I saw in scrying.

02:12:39.657 --> 02:12:42.300
More importantly, what
this means is that she

02:12:42.334 --> 02:12:44.234
is on this plane of existence.

02:12:44.267 --> 02:12:48.734
I can't scry if she's on
another plane, so she's here.

02:12:48.767 --> 02:12:51.767
LIAM: Do you know where
that island is?

02:12:51.801 --> 02:12:54.000
♪

02:12:54.033 --> 02:12:56.634
MARISHA: I could attempt to think

02:12:56.667 --> 02:12:59.667
really hard about it.

02:12:59.701 --> 02:13:00.767
I could attempt to think.

02:13:00.767 --> 02:13:03.540
SAM: The Marisha Ray Story.

02:13:03.540 --> 02:13:05.334
LIAM: Scrying doesn't
give any direction.

02:13:05.334 --> 02:13:07.434
MATT: I mean even the
visuals I'm giving

02:13:07.467 --> 02:13:10.000
from a narrative standpoint
are like a little more

02:13:10.033 --> 02:13:11.868
than the spell should,
but it's for fun.

02:13:11.901 --> 02:13:15.000
MARISHA: Can I do like a--can
I do a roll to see--

02:13:15.033 --> 02:13:18.467
-MATT: Make an intelligence check.
-MARISHA: Oh, geez.

02:13:18.501 --> 02:13:21.434
Thanks for your vote
of confidence, Sam.

02:13:21.467 --> 02:13:23.434
That's not good,
that's not good.

02:13:23.467 --> 02:13:25.133
-SAM: For the dice.
-MARISHA: This is your fault.

02:13:25.167 --> 02:13:27.667
-It's a five total.
-SAM: Yeah, it is.

02:13:27.701 --> 02:13:30.501
MARISHA: Wait, wait, wait, no, just a
straight intelligence check?

02:13:30.534 --> 02:13:33.634
-MATT: Yup, intelligence modifier.
-MARISHA: Yeah, it's five.

02:13:33.667 --> 02:13:36.801
MATT: Yeah, you've--you,
for lack of a better term,

02:13:36.834 --> 02:13:39.267
are the homeschooled
one of the bunch,

02:13:39.300 --> 02:13:42.868
and you only recently left the--

02:13:42.901 --> 02:13:47.100
well, before meeting the
rest of these adventurers,

02:13:47.133 --> 02:13:49.167
you know, left Zephra to go

02:13:49.200 --> 02:13:50.501
and see what the
world was about.

02:13:50.534 --> 02:13:53.000
So, unfortunately, you don't
have as much worldly experience

02:13:53.033 --> 02:13:54.767
as other people
on your team would.

02:13:54.801 --> 02:13:57.767
So the visuals you
have clear in your mind,

02:13:57.801 --> 02:14:02.434
you have no personal life
experience or any place

02:14:02.467 --> 02:14:05.033
that you've seen that you
can connect the dots to.

02:14:05.067 --> 02:14:07.033
MARISHA: I turned to Pike and asked--

02:14:07.067 --> 02:14:09.667
and tell her of the island,

02:14:09.701 --> 02:14:12.467
and ask if she has
encountered anything

02:14:12.501 --> 02:14:16.400
like this in her travels.

02:14:16.434 --> 02:14:19.667
MATT: She closes her eyes for a second
and kinda winces a little bit,

02:14:19.701 --> 02:14:22.701
her tongue kinda peaks outside
her mouth for a second.

02:14:22.734 --> 02:14:26.734
"Uh, no.

02:14:26.767 --> 02:14:29.133
Wide ocean, you said, right?"

02:14:29.167 --> 02:14:33.767
MARISHA: Big, nothing but ocean, except
for that one singular island.

02:14:33.801 --> 02:14:36.534
It looked like there was
geothermal activity going on,

02:14:36.567 --> 02:14:41.067
so it must be near a
volcano or something.

02:14:41.100 --> 02:14:44.100
MATT: "Most of my sailing was
done in the Ozmit Sea."

02:14:44.133 --> 02:14:45.601
MARISHA: Nothing like that?

02:14:45.634 --> 02:14:47.617
MATT: "Nothing that I've seen.

02:14:47.617 --> 02:14:49.294
Sorry."

02:14:50.267 --> 02:14:52.834
MARISHA: It's okay, Pikey.

02:14:52.868 --> 02:14:55.267
PATRICK: I'll throw a Hail Mary,
like how wide-ranging

02:14:55.300 --> 02:14:57.667
was I back in the day

02:14:57.701 --> 02:14:59.701
when I was doing
this for my career?

02:14:59.734 --> 02:15:01.801
Any of this sound
familiar to me?

02:15:01.834 --> 02:15:04.567
-MATT: Roll an intelligence check.
-LAURA: Come on!

02:15:04.601 --> 02:15:08.133
(mixed remarks)

02:15:08.167 --> 02:15:11.067
Natural 20!

02:15:11.100 --> 02:15:13.067
-PATRICK: Eighteen.
-MATT: Eighteen?

02:15:13.100 --> 02:15:15.334
Plus your intelligence modifier?

02:15:15.367 --> 02:15:18.601
PATRICK: Eighteen.

02:15:18.634 --> 02:15:21.033
No negative modifiers.

02:15:21.067 --> 02:15:23.400
MATT: That's good.
Must be nice.

02:15:23.434 --> 02:15:26.434
(laughing)

02:15:29.667 --> 02:15:32.033
As Keyleth is going over
the description again,

02:15:32.067 --> 02:15:35.400
you're thinking about it,
and you did a bit of sailing.

02:15:35.434 --> 02:15:39.000
Sailing in the Lucidian
Ocean is difficult.

02:15:39.033 --> 02:15:43.434
That's why Wildmount...

02:15:43.467 --> 02:15:46.534
-Take it outside, Liam.
-LAURA: He's good, he's good.

02:15:46.567 --> 02:15:48.267
-MARISHA: Don't die.
-LIAM: I pulled the wrong card

02:15:48.300 --> 02:15:50.467
from the deck.

02:15:50.501 --> 02:15:54.234
MATT: The glass of many drinks.

02:15:54.267 --> 02:15:57.133
You've done a bit of
sailing out of necessity,

02:15:57.167 --> 02:16:00.133
and the Lucidian Ocean is known
for being the more treacherous

02:16:00.167 --> 02:16:02.133
of the large bodies
of water, which is why

02:16:02.167 --> 02:16:04.601
between Wildmount and
the other continents

02:16:04.634 --> 02:16:06.167
there isn't a whole lot
of trade, or the trade

02:16:06.200 --> 02:16:08.868
that's out there is generally
considered very expensive

02:16:08.901 --> 02:16:13.167
and for rarer items
and resources.

02:16:13.200 --> 02:16:15.767
What catches your
mind is the idea

02:16:15.801 --> 02:16:18.167
of geothermal activity.

02:16:18.200 --> 02:16:22.033
And while you haven't

02:16:22.067 --> 02:16:24.734
specifically been
to a place like that,

02:16:24.767 --> 02:16:27.067
the islands you know
that usually contain

02:16:27.100 --> 02:16:29.734
that type of
subvolcanic activity

02:16:29.767 --> 02:16:34.133
to expel that type of, you know,

02:16:34.165 --> 02:16:37.566
region based terrain,

02:16:37.601 --> 02:16:41.534
those usually are in
the southern region,

02:16:41.566 --> 02:16:43.400
south of Tal'Dorei.

02:16:43.433 --> 02:16:46.601
♪

02:16:46.634 --> 02:16:50.534
More like southern,
southern Ozmit Sea.

02:16:50.566 --> 02:16:53.334
Close, but not specifically
to the Hespit Archipelago,

02:16:53.367 --> 02:16:56.400
but somewhere in that
similar type region.

02:16:56.433 --> 02:16:58.400
♪

02:16:58.433 --> 02:17:00.868
SAM: Hespit Archipelago?

02:17:00.901 --> 02:17:03.133
TRAVIS: I believe it's archipela-jo.

02:17:03.165 --> 02:17:04.933
MATT: I'm gonna throw every
dice at you, Travis.

02:17:04.968 --> 02:17:07.933
(laughing)

02:17:07.968 --> 02:17:09.700
MARISHA: Southern southern Ozmit Sea.

02:17:09.734 --> 02:17:13.467
PATRICK: This lair did not seem to
be the bookish sort of lair,

02:17:13.501 --> 02:17:16.799
like the sort of dragon
who collects a lot of lore,

02:17:16.834 --> 02:17:18.767
and would have like,
stuff like that, no.

02:17:18.799 --> 02:17:21.566
MATT: No, not this one, this--the--

02:17:21.601 --> 02:17:23.433
Thordak in particular
has been interesting too,

02:17:23.467 --> 02:17:25.767
and as people have been
discussing it here--

02:17:25.799 --> 02:17:28.100
once a very intelligent

02:17:28.133 --> 02:17:30.968
and cunning Red Dragon.

02:17:31.000 --> 02:17:32.267
You don't know the
full details of it,

02:17:32.299 --> 02:17:35.467
but there was something
about his return

02:17:35.501 --> 02:17:39.868
to this realm after being sealed
on the Fire Elemental plane,

02:17:39.901 --> 02:17:42.634
his return involved harboring

02:17:42.665 --> 02:17:45.501
an enchanted gem within
his chest that kind of held

02:17:45.534 --> 02:17:47.901
and carried the essence of
the Fire plane with him,

02:17:47.933 --> 02:17:50.700
and the longer it
resided within Thordak,

02:17:50.734 --> 02:17:53.901
it caused him to mutate
and swell into this, like,

02:17:53.933 --> 02:17:58.165
primordial beast dragon,
but it also drove him insane.

02:17:58.200 --> 02:18:00.367
And so everything
you've seen in the lair,

02:18:00.400 --> 02:18:04.334
it seems to be a natural
chaotic formation

02:18:04.367 --> 02:18:07.000
of a more feral
type dragon mentality

02:18:07.031 --> 02:18:09.133
than what you've heard
about in your travels.

02:18:09.165 --> 02:18:12.665
PATRICK: Right, um, the only other thing

02:18:12.700 --> 02:18:15.234
I can think of from
what you've described

02:18:15.267 --> 02:18:19.200
is if she was there, and she--

02:18:19.234 --> 02:18:23.566
and this place was obviously
in ruin and abandoned,

02:18:23.601 --> 02:18:26.933
and she was tossing at
looking for information--

02:18:26.968 --> 02:18:29.968
it wasn't hers,
but it's abandoned--

02:18:30.000 --> 02:18:32.400
the only thing I can think
of that she would want

02:18:32.433 --> 02:18:35.433
would be some sort
of lore or magic,

02:18:35.467 --> 02:18:37.834
which means this is the lab

02:18:37.868 --> 02:18:40.700
of someone powerful,

02:18:40.734 --> 02:18:42.700
which means those people

02:18:42.734 --> 02:18:45.734
show up in stories.

02:18:45.767 --> 02:18:50.234
And so, that might be

02:18:50.267 --> 02:18:53.868
a way to find out where this is.

02:18:53.901 --> 02:18:56.868
In this area, if you find out

02:18:56.901 --> 02:18:59.868
who was doing terrible things--

02:18:59.901 --> 02:19:01.700
'cause you said cages, right?

02:19:01.734 --> 02:19:04.634
-MARISHA: Yes.
-PATRICK: Nothing good comes from cages.

02:19:04.665 --> 02:19:09.100
So whoever was doing terrible
things in that area--

02:19:09.133 --> 02:19:11.400
LAURA: Maybe a necromancer
of some sort?

02:19:11.433 --> 02:19:15.133
PATRICK: Well, if she stole
a dead dragon...

02:19:15.165 --> 02:19:17.501
LAURA: Hm, all right.

02:19:17.534 --> 02:19:21.234
TALIESIN: Can I make a lore roll
for Booky McBookerson?

02:19:21.267 --> 02:19:23.367
MATT: Make a history check.

02:19:25.400 --> 02:19:26.700
TALIESIN: Natural twenty.

02:19:26.734 --> 02:19:29.433
(cheering)

02:19:29.467 --> 02:19:32.700
PATRICK: The look of incredulity
on his face!

02:19:32.734 --> 02:19:35.734
TALIESIN: That's a 29.

02:19:35.767 --> 02:19:37.665
MATT: Literally was like,
If he's...

02:19:37.700 --> 02:19:40.968
he better roll
a natural-- okay.

02:19:41.000 --> 02:19:43.734
TALIESIN: You're just gonna hand me your
notebook and I can just read.

02:19:43.767 --> 02:19:46.334
-MATT: No.
-TRAVIS: Well done, man.

02:19:46.367 --> 02:19:48.165
MARISHA: Holy shit, holy shit!

02:19:48.200 --> 02:19:49.901
TALIESIN: Knew there was one
in there somewhere.

02:19:49.934 --> 02:19:52.901
MARISHA: Oh my god, you just saved
us a trip to the library.

02:19:52.934 --> 02:19:55.000
-MATT: Don't say that yet.
-TALIESIN: I was about to say,

02:19:55.033 --> 02:19:56.834
no, we're going to the library.

02:19:56.868 --> 02:19:59.734
Use these places or
they disappear.

02:19:59.767 --> 02:20:02.100
MATT: You have always had

02:20:02.133 --> 02:20:04.901
a mild fascination
with the macabre.

02:20:04.934 --> 02:20:09.467
And since the Age of
Arcanum was also referred

02:20:09.501 --> 02:20:12.067
to as the Age of
Wanton Necromancy,

02:20:12.100 --> 02:20:15.033
because at the time,
there was no law against it.

02:20:15.067 --> 02:20:19.234
While necromancy exists
in modern day Tal'Dorei--

02:20:19.267 --> 02:20:22.067
more so in Wildmount,
but it's generally

02:20:22.100 --> 02:20:25.634
heavily regulated.

02:20:27.834 --> 02:20:30.868
There are very few necromancers
that weren't sanctioned

02:20:30.901 --> 02:20:34.000
or part of a government
system so that

02:20:34.033 --> 02:20:35.667
it could be very
closely watched,

02:20:35.701 --> 02:20:37.868
and any sort of research or
development could be made,

02:20:37.901 --> 02:20:40.200
you know, made sure
that it didn't turn into

02:20:40.234 --> 02:20:42.868
the usual classic, you know--
My power's greater

02:20:42.901 --> 02:20:44.968
than everything, I'm gonna
go off and do my own thing.

02:20:45.000 --> 02:20:47.421
The den that she's
describing is very much

02:20:47.421 --> 02:20:49.667
that type of a necromancer.

02:20:49.701 --> 02:20:52.300
And there are only a handful

02:20:52.334 --> 02:20:55.300
that catch your attention.

02:20:55.334 --> 02:20:58.767
One, uh,

02:20:58.801 --> 02:21:03.033
is an entity that you're
very familiar with.

02:21:03.067 --> 02:21:04.767
That is what was once

02:21:04.801 --> 02:21:08.167
a great mage, necromancer,

02:21:08.200 --> 02:21:11.834
that began to pursue

02:21:11.868 --> 02:21:15.834
ascension to god-dom,

02:21:15.868 --> 02:21:17.234
known as the Whispered One,

02:21:17.267 --> 02:21:19.667
or the very familiar
name of Vecna.

02:21:19.701 --> 02:21:21.834
However, however,

02:21:21.868 --> 02:21:25.601
the acknowledgement
of Vecna's history

02:21:25.634 --> 02:21:28.200
was heavily tied into Wildmount,

02:21:28.234 --> 02:21:29.934
and what little bit
of research you've done

02:21:29.968 --> 02:21:33.167
into the back history
of the Briarwoods

02:21:33.200 --> 02:21:36.934
says that wherever Vecna's old,

02:21:36.968 --> 02:21:39.801
forgotten laboratory was,

02:21:39.834 --> 02:21:42.967
it most likely existed on
the continent of Wildmount.

02:21:42.967 --> 02:21:45.167
The only other individual
you can think of

02:21:45.200 --> 02:21:47.534
that is known historically

02:21:47.567 --> 02:21:51.534
was an individual
known as Opash.

02:21:51.567 --> 02:21:54.834
Opash was a
sanctioned necromancer

02:21:54.868 --> 02:21:58.234
during the Age of Arcanum

02:21:58.267 --> 02:22:00.601
on the continent of Marquet,

02:22:00.634 --> 02:22:04.100
and then after being
discovered to be

02:22:04.133 --> 02:22:08.300
delving into his own
experimentations,

02:22:08.334 --> 02:22:12.100
largely in the idea of
crafting and sculpting flesh

02:22:12.133 --> 02:22:15.000
and undead flesh into
whatever form it wishes,

02:22:15.033 --> 02:22:18.968
as well as the prolonging of
life to pursue this endeavor,

02:22:19.000 --> 02:22:23.200
was set to be,
was set to be executed.

02:22:23.234 --> 02:22:26.834
Through some very,
very clever conversations

02:22:26.868 --> 02:22:30.033
and favors that were owed

02:22:30.067 --> 02:22:32.868
to Opash, it was agreed instead

02:22:32.901 --> 02:22:36.757
to just banish the
necromancer out to sea.

02:22:36.757 --> 02:22:39.567
-SAM: Well, that could be it too.
-MARISHA: Wait, what was that last part?

02:22:39.601 --> 02:22:41.701
That was really important,
banish the necromancer

02:22:41.734 --> 02:22:45.000
-out to sea?
-MATT: Banished out to sea.

02:22:45.033 --> 02:22:48.200
-MARISHA: Who was banished to sea?
-MATT: Opash.

02:22:48.234 --> 02:22:50.934
SAM: So those are two different
stories, two different--

02:22:50.968 --> 02:22:55.300
MATT: Those are the only two, like,
famous necromancers that--

02:22:55.334 --> 02:22:58.567
-SAM: Are a-sea.
-LAURA: You're brilliant.

02:22:58.601 --> 02:23:02.701
MARISHA: You guys--you're all--
we have such smart friends.

02:23:02.734 --> 02:23:05.100
Oh my goodness.

02:23:05.133 --> 02:23:06.667
TALIESIN: Well, we need to, in theory,

02:23:06.701 --> 02:23:09.868
find the last resting
place of Opash.

02:23:09.901 --> 02:23:14.200
MARISHA: Well, you know, we have--

02:23:14.234 --> 02:23:16.400
TALIESIN: Can't be harder than
killing a Red Dragon.

02:23:16.434 --> 02:23:19.968
MARISHA: We have a paladin
of the Raven Queen,

02:23:20.000 --> 02:23:23.730
and from what I remember, the
Raven Queen hates necromancers.

02:23:23.730 --> 02:23:26.267
LAURA: Vecna is one of
her sworn enemies.

02:23:26.300 --> 02:23:29.868
MARISHA: Maybe she knows, maybe
you could talk to her.

02:23:29.901 --> 02:23:33.000
TALIESIN: We can do that
back at Whitestone.

02:23:33.033 --> 02:23:35.801
PATRICK: What do I know about
the Raven Queen?

02:23:35.834 --> 02:23:37.801
(laughing)

02:23:37.834 --> 02:23:41.133
Because that one's,
that one's new to me.

02:23:41.167 --> 02:23:43.467
MATT: So yes, it catches
your attention.

02:23:43.501 --> 02:23:45.834
The Raven Queen,
the mother of ravens

02:23:45.868 --> 02:23:50.400
is, um, is a fairly
prominent member

02:23:50.434 --> 02:23:53.467
of the Pantheon of Exandria,
the entire world.

02:23:53.501 --> 02:23:55.934
Once immortal,
ascended to take on

02:23:55.968 --> 02:23:59.734
the mantle of death and winter

02:23:59.767 --> 02:24:03.334
as her domains of influence.

02:24:03.367 --> 02:24:07.868
She presides not
over the afterlife,

02:24:07.901 --> 02:24:12.467
but the moment in transition
from life to death.

02:24:12.501 --> 02:24:15.734
She is the keeper of fate,

02:24:15.767 --> 02:24:19.734
and keeps watch over
the destinies of those

02:24:19.767 --> 02:24:22.834
who walk the prime
and beyond planes,

02:24:22.868 --> 02:24:25.968
and occasionally takes
interest in those

02:24:26.000 --> 02:24:28.767
that tend to bend the
threads around them.

02:24:28.801 --> 02:24:31.834
Um, you know,

02:24:31.868 --> 02:24:33.667
resurrection, healing magic,

02:24:33.701 --> 02:24:36.701
things that maintain
life naturally

02:24:36.734 --> 02:24:39.334
or a natural life, per se,

02:24:39.367 --> 02:24:41.467
are not infractions
upon her belief

02:24:41.501 --> 02:24:44.367
as destiny is stronger and
if an entity is meant to live

02:24:44.400 --> 02:24:46.767
to fulfill his destiny,

02:24:46.801 --> 02:24:49.267
then that is how
it's meant to be.

02:24:49.300 --> 02:24:51.467
It's the creatures
that pervert destiny,

02:24:51.501 --> 02:24:55.234
creatures that bypassed
the natural predestined

02:24:55.267 --> 02:24:59.601
and essentially, balk what,

02:24:59.634 --> 02:25:02.200
in her sphere,
says is supposed to be

02:25:02.234 --> 02:25:04.234
your way, your path,
your timeline.

02:25:04.267 --> 02:25:06.968
Those are her fervent enemies.

02:25:07.000 --> 02:25:09.634
Largely feared because
of what she represents.

02:25:09.667 --> 02:25:13.234
Largely misunderstood because
of what she represents.

02:25:13.267 --> 02:25:15.367
Generally, worship of the
Raven Queen is pretty rare

02:25:15.400 --> 02:25:17.734
from the circles
you've run into.

02:25:17.767 --> 02:25:19.970
You've generally
walked in a lot of--

02:25:19.970 --> 02:25:22.001
especially in recent years--

02:25:22.001 --> 02:25:24.334
more, um--

02:25:24.367 --> 02:25:26.968
for lack of a better term--

02:25:27.000 --> 02:25:29.901
-not urban--
-LAURA: Rural.

02:25:29.934 --> 02:25:32.334
MATT: Rural, thank you,
more rural environments

02:25:32.367 --> 02:25:33.968
Raven Queen worship
is acknowledged,

02:25:34.000 --> 02:25:36.601
but generally there's
no temples to her.

02:25:36.634 --> 02:25:38.734
-PATRICK: Right, okay.
-TALIESIN: I love the notion of

02:25:38.767 --> 02:25:41.667
cornfield Raven Queen worship.

02:25:41.701 --> 02:25:43.167

02:25:43.200 --> 02:25:45.267

02:25:49.734 --> 02:25:51.133

02:25:54.367 --> 02:25:56.434

02:25:56.467 --> 02:25:59.234
I mean, I know she's
prone to lying,

02:25:59.267 --> 02:26:01.868
but she did say she
was from Wildmount.

02:26:01.901 --> 02:26:05.467
That's where she wanted
to go back to she said.

02:26:07.601 --> 02:26:10.834
TALIESIN: We have two very clean paths.

02:26:10.868 --> 02:26:14.234
LAURA: Maybe she's studying necromancy,
maybe she's been studying Vecna,

02:26:14.267 --> 02:26:15.934
maybe she's been studying Opash.

02:26:15.968 --> 02:26:18.767
TALIESIN: Maybe she's been studying a
lot of things, but one of them

02:26:18.801 --> 02:26:22.667
would probably be how to
resurrect a red dragon.

02:26:22.701 --> 02:26:25.734
MARISHA: And she's also very
familiar with, I'm sure,

02:26:25.767 --> 02:26:28.667
whatever the Briarwoods were
doing, and with whatever

02:26:28.701 --> 02:26:31.567
the Ziggurat is on
the bottom of Whitestone

02:26:31.601 --> 02:26:34.067
that we still don't know
what it's technically for.

02:26:34.100 --> 02:26:35.400
-LAURA: She knows what it is.
-MARISHA: I bet she does.

02:26:35.434 --> 02:26:38.133

the orb of death is.

-MARISHA: Is Gilmore still around?
-MATT: Gilmore is.

02:26:41.234 --> 02:26:43.501
Gilmore's kind of listening
to the conversation

02:26:43.534 --> 02:26:46.033
while finishing closing off
the satchels that he's filled

02:26:46.067 --> 02:26:48.734
with coin, and is currently
kind of thinking to himself

02:26:48.767 --> 02:26:51.434
with his, you know,
fingers crossed, his chin

02:26:51.467 --> 02:26:53.801
kind of perched upon his hands,
and himself, trying to see

02:26:53.834 --> 02:26:56.000
if there's anything he knows
out of the conversation.

02:26:56.033 --> 02:26:57.767
You do notice that also at
this point there's a very faint

02:26:57.801 --> 02:26:59.267
glowing glyph on his forehead.

02:26:59.300 --> 02:27:02.901

-MATT: Oh, and he kinda waves a hand

02:27:20.100 --> 02:27:23.067
briefly, and it kind of
fades back into his skin

02:27:23.100 --> 02:27:24.767

no glow there.

02:33:21.100 --> 02:33:23.531
TALIESIN: I'm not actually
going to build a list,

02:33:23.531 --> 02:33:25.367
we're just gonna make--

02:33:25.400 --> 02:33:29.300
MARISHA: How much longer do you think
Raishan will stay there?

02:33:29.334 --> 02:33:31.734
Especially if she's not finding
what she's looking for.

02:33:31.767 --> 02:33:34.033
-TRAVIS: Not long.
-TALIESIN: I think it'll be a base

02:33:34.067 --> 02:33:35.667
of operations, that's
what I would do.

02:33:35.701 --> 02:33:37.534
If I thought that I was
going to be safe somewhere,

02:33:37.567 --> 02:33:40.300
I would stay there
and simply hunt out,

02:33:40.334 --> 02:33:43.000
much as we did with Whitestone.

02:33:43.033 --> 02:33:44.634
Safe until it's not.

02:33:44.667 --> 02:33:47.801
LAURA: Do you think she knew
you were scrying on her?

02:33:47.834 --> 02:33:49.840
MARISHA: She didn't seem to notice.

02:33:49.840 --> 02:33:51.367
A lot of times
you can kinda tell.

02:33:51.400 --> 02:33:55.200
-LAURA: Yeah.
-MARISHA: She seemed distracted.

02:33:55.234 --> 02:33:58.067
-TALIESIN: She's been beaten pretty badly.
-MARISHA: Yeah.

02:33:58.100 --> 02:34:02.234
LAURA: We should get to Whitestone.

02:34:02.267 --> 02:34:04.734
SAM: Is here taken care of?

02:34:04.767 --> 02:34:07.868
And do we need to stop
in on our home, our keep,

02:34:07.901 --> 02:34:10.234
and do anything there
before we leave?

02:34:10.267 --> 02:34:13.133
LIAM: I mean, can--aren't
we all tapped out?

02:34:13.167 --> 02:34:15.534
Can you get us
to Whitestone now?

02:34:15.567 --> 02:34:17.767
LAURA: Maybe we spend the
night in the keep

02:34:17.801 --> 02:34:19.868
-for old time's sake.
-SAM: For old time's sake.

02:34:19.901 --> 02:34:23.467
-TRAVIS: The old hangout!
-MARISHA: I could get us to--

02:34:23.501 --> 02:34:27.400
back to Whitestone using
my last seventh level spell,

02:34:27.434 --> 02:34:31.100
and then that's it,
I'm done, done, done.

02:34:31.133 --> 02:34:33.767
-TALIESIN: We could go home.
-SAM: You couldn't get all of us,

02:34:33.801 --> 02:34:36.734
-right, I mean--
-MARISHA: No, transport via plants.

02:34:36.767 --> 02:34:40.000
SAM: But like Jarrett,
and Kima, and Gilmore--

02:34:40.033 --> 02:34:42.267
-MARISHA: It lasts six seconds.
-MATT: "If we all go quickly, yeah."

02:34:42.300 --> 02:34:44.767
-LIAM: We could get in a line.
-MARISHA: I think my record was like

02:34:44.801 --> 02:34:47.334
25 people when we were
moving refugees through.

02:34:47.367 --> 02:34:50.834
Yeah, it was pretty good,
still trying to break that.

02:34:50.868 --> 02:34:54.033
MATT: "I would recommend not
really trying to break it."

02:34:54.067 --> 02:34:55.767
PATRICK: We don't wanna
get 25 and a half.

02:34:55.801 --> 02:34:57.868
(laughing)

02:34:57.901 --> 02:35:00.234

happen, I can tell."

02:35:00.267 --> 02:35:03.033
(mixed remarks)

02:35:03.067 --> 02:35:06.334
"Well, I'm glad I'm alive,
I'm glad you're all alive."

02:35:06.367 --> 02:35:08.734
-LAURA: Thank you for helping.
-LIAM: Thank you, Shaun.

02:35:08.767 --> 02:35:11.367
MATT: "It's the least I could do,
and if anything, it's really--

02:35:11.400 --> 02:35:14.868
this experience has helped me
come to terms with the fact

02:35:14.901 --> 02:35:18.767
that I should not be
on the battlefield.

02:35:18.801 --> 02:35:21.434
I need to stay in
the shop, and I--"

02:35:21.467 --> 02:35:24.167
TRAVIS: That is not true, that finger
of yours is very powerful.

02:35:24.200 --> 02:35:26.934
MATT: "Yes, and I was
also on fire a lot.

02:35:26.968 --> 02:35:28.634
-I want to avoid that."
-TRAVIS: That's true.

02:35:28.667 --> 02:35:30.734
TALIESIN: Are you gonna be
rebuilding your shop here

02:35:30.767 --> 02:35:33.234
or are we gonna see you
in Whitestone as well?

02:35:33.267 --> 02:35:35.334
MATT: "You know, my intent
a while back

02:35:35.367 --> 02:35:39.067
was to start a franchise.

02:35:39.100 --> 02:35:41.667
We'll see how the winds carry
me, after all, I think--"

02:35:41.701 --> 02:35:44.234
And he kinda tugs open this
large heavy sack and satchel

02:35:44.267 --> 02:35:47.033
that's on his side now,
and to the other side you see

02:35:47.067 --> 02:35:51.467
a small compact bag of
holding, and he goes,

02:35:51.501 --> 02:35:53.467
"I think I've got
it taken care of."

I would love to.

02:36:33.667 --> 02:36:36.501
I would love to,
give me just a moment,

02:36:36.534 --> 02:36:39.267
and I head back to the troops

02:36:39.300 --> 02:36:42.467
and I talk to, like,
the couple of them

02:36:42.501 --> 02:36:45.167
that have kind
of like risen up--

02:36:45.200 --> 02:36:47.133
-LAURA: Samantha.
-PATRICK: Samantha, yeah,

02:36:47.167 --> 02:36:49.133
like fucking runs the
whole thing right now.

-LIAM: Sam's pretty legit.
-PATRICK: Yeah.

02:36:51.968 --> 02:36:54.968
And so--and I also

02:36:55.000 --> 02:36:58.567
kind of circumspectly--

02:36:58.601 --> 02:37:03.133
I sort of distribute
a little bit of money.

02:37:03.167 --> 02:37:06.067
I give Samantha some,
and this is like--

02:37:06.100 --> 02:37:08.033
it's like if something happens,

02:37:08.067 --> 02:37:12.400
if I don't come back,
here's how long you stay,

02:37:12.434 --> 02:37:15.534
here's what to do
among the populous.

02:37:15.567 --> 02:37:19.534
Like--and I don't need to
give them the talk of like,

02:37:19.567 --> 02:37:22.434
No looting, 'cause they've
already had Daddy Ker

02:37:22.467 --> 02:37:24.977
like constantly lecturing them
about how to not be dicks.

02:37:24.977 --> 02:37:27.267
MATT: The kind of people that would
follow you into battle for this,

02:37:27.300 --> 02:37:29.400
as small as your group was,
the kind of people that you know

02:37:29.434 --> 02:37:31.200
you can trust this, and
Samantha with her like,

02:37:31.234 --> 02:37:33.634
kind of, you know, graying
hair that's pulled into

02:37:33.667 --> 02:37:36.200
this kind of hard topknot
on top, and her darker skin

02:37:36.234 --> 02:37:39.734
with the scar across her cheek,
and her breastplate of armor,

02:37:39.767 --> 02:37:41.634
she comes up and kind of
grabs your hand and goes,

02:37:41.667 --> 02:37:43.701
"Don't worry, I've got it
taken care of, it's fine."

02:37:43.734 --> 02:37:46.133

you've done it before.

make sure with what you've given

02:37:49.033 --> 02:37:51.734
that we'll get it back to
the families that remain."

02:37:51.767 --> 02:37:55.067

02:37:55.100 --> 02:37:58.567
a tricky place for
a couple of weeks,

02:37:58.601 --> 02:38:02.000
and not only could our
people maybe use a rest,

02:38:02.033 --> 02:38:05.667
but maybe it would benefit from

02:38:05.701 --> 02:38:09.434
30 or 40 level-handed
people with swords

02:38:09.467 --> 02:38:12.200
maybe keeping an eye out,

02:38:12.234 --> 02:38:14.167
maybe traveling in
pairs around the city

02:38:14.200 --> 02:38:17.100
making sure nobody's
houses get broken into.

02:38:17.133 --> 02:38:19.400
Just--you can't take
care of everything,

02:38:19.434 --> 02:38:22.567
but it would not be bad to
camp out maybe for a week.

02:38:22.601 --> 02:38:24.868
Wait for me, and I'll be back,

02:38:24.901 --> 02:38:26.868

looks like she could

02:41:50.834 --> 02:41:54.267
and stay safe."

02:41:54.300 --> 02:41:58.367
And he turns back to
handle some more business.

02:41:58.400 --> 02:41:59.901
What do you guys wanna do?

02:41:59.934 --> 02:42:02.801
-TRAVIS: Make for Greyskull Keep--
-LAURA: Where our giant tree is

02:42:02.834 --> 02:42:05.267
so we can go to
our other giant tree.

02:42:05.300 --> 02:42:08.033
-MATT: Okay.
-MARISHA: What they said.

02:42:08.067 --> 02:42:10.763
MATT: You guys make your
way walking southward

02:42:10.763 --> 02:42:13.000
through Emon, and--

02:42:13.033 --> 02:42:15.734
LAURA: Just loot everything
along the way, like--

02:42:15.767 --> 02:42:18.801
-MARISHA: Just like decking children.
-LAURA: Every person you see.

02:42:18.834 --> 02:42:22.501
(crosstalk)

02:42:22.534 --> 02:42:26.634
LIAM: Matt starts rolling
random encounters.

02:42:26.667 --> 02:42:29.200
MATT: Six episodes just
getting out of Emon.

02:42:29.234 --> 02:42:31.367
(laughing)

02:42:31.400 --> 02:42:34.300
TRAVIS: Why the hell did we walk?

02:42:34.334 --> 02:42:37.133
MATT: You guys make your way
through, and as you do,

02:42:37.167 --> 02:42:40.133
it's, it's an emotional journey,

02:42:40.167 --> 02:42:43.734
because as you walk through
the city that became your home

02:42:43.767 --> 02:42:46.968
as you all became a family,

02:42:47.000 --> 02:42:48.767
you can see familiar sights,

02:42:48.801 --> 02:42:53.067
you can see familiar
thoroughfares,

02:42:53.100 --> 02:42:57.167
and streetsides, and taverns,

02:42:57.200 --> 02:42:59.400
many of which have
sustained severe damage,

02:42:59.434 --> 02:43:03.067
many that have been reduced
to nothing but rubble and ash.

02:43:03.100 --> 02:43:04.968
And some that still
stand defiantly

02:43:05.000 --> 02:43:08.267
versus all the
difficulty, and stress,

02:43:08.300 --> 02:43:12.601
and strenuous struggle
that has existed

02:43:12.634 --> 02:43:15.601
for weeks and weeks
and weeks here.

02:43:15.634 --> 02:43:17.767
You see people slowly
emerging from the shadows

02:43:17.801 --> 02:43:20.501
to try and reclaim what
remains of their life,

02:43:20.534 --> 02:43:22.133
but you also see them
helping each other.

02:43:22.167 --> 02:43:26.234
You also see a comparison

02:43:26.267 --> 02:43:29.000
between the busy bustle

02:43:29.033 --> 02:43:31.334
and kind of general
selfish lifestyle

02:43:31.367 --> 02:43:34.734
that most people in a well-off
capital city exist in

02:43:34.767 --> 02:43:37.767
replaced with a newly
understood sense of kinship

02:43:37.801 --> 02:43:40.133
and looking out for each other.

02:43:40.167 --> 02:43:43.067
You see the guards
themselves beginning

02:43:43.100 --> 02:43:47.334
to really understand,

02:43:47.367 --> 02:43:49.467
in their lifetime,
the first true,

02:43:49.501 --> 02:43:51.968
large-scale victory
for the betterment

02:43:52.000 --> 02:43:54.167
of their people and
what that means to them.

02:43:54.200 --> 02:43:58.300
And there's kinda
a sense of pride

02:43:58.334 --> 02:44:00.734
through the sadness that
many of the armed soldiers

02:44:00.767 --> 02:44:03.400
you've come across
probably never had.

02:44:03.434 --> 02:44:06.334
♪

02:44:06.367 --> 02:44:08.334
It gives you hope,

02:44:08.367 --> 02:44:10.434
though to see it in
such a state in itself

02:44:10.467 --> 02:44:14.567
is harrowing in its own right.

02:44:14.601 --> 02:44:16.801
You can already begin to
see through this energy

02:44:16.834 --> 02:44:20.167
and through the
slow crawling return

02:44:20.200 --> 02:44:24.133
to life that you've
helped ensure

02:44:24.167 --> 02:44:27.267
that Emon still has a future,

02:44:27.300 --> 02:44:30.018
let alone Tal'Dorei itself.

02:44:30.018 --> 02:44:32.834
No one catches your
attention as you leave,

02:44:32.868 --> 02:44:36.667
but a number of eyes train
onto you as you exit.

02:44:36.701 --> 02:44:39.501
And many of them flash
with recognition,

02:44:39.534 --> 02:44:42.534
their face going bright,

02:44:42.567 --> 02:44:46.667
and then with just a solemn nod

02:44:46.701 --> 02:44:49.801
of, "Thank you."

02:44:49.834 --> 02:44:52.767
Eventually you find yourself
to the southern gates of Emon

02:44:52.801 --> 02:44:57.000
exiting out into the charred
fields that once were green

02:44:57.033 --> 02:45:01.601
and lush with grain and grass.

02:45:01.634 --> 02:45:04.667
Eventually coming upon the
exterior of Greyskull Keep,

02:45:04.701 --> 02:45:07.167
the home of Vox Machina.

02:45:07.200 --> 02:45:11.000
Just as you left it, abandoned,
the front gate partially ajar.

02:45:11.033 --> 02:45:12.934
There stands the keep.

02:45:12.968 --> 02:45:15.100
Mighty, defiant,

02:45:15.133 --> 02:45:18.367
and somewhere there is a jar
of no-longer-magical poop.

02:45:18.400 --> 02:45:21.267
(laughing)

02:45:21.300 --> 02:45:23.634
Making your way inside, there
is the garden that you left

02:45:23.667 --> 02:45:25.801
within the Temple to Sarenrae

02:45:25.834 --> 02:45:27.801
and the large central
tree that you use

02:45:27.834 --> 02:45:30.734
for most of your transport
to and from, Keyleth.

02:45:30.767 --> 02:45:34.467
-MARISHA: How's the garden look?
-MATT: Looks as good as you left it.

02:45:34.501 --> 02:45:36.467
It was far enough from
the battle to where

02:45:36.501 --> 02:45:38.901
it didn't seem to suffer
any sort of blows or issues.

02:45:38.934 --> 02:45:41.200
You guys managed to basically
focus everything within

02:45:41.234 --> 02:45:44.834
the city's walls, so,
good on you for that.

02:45:47.734 --> 02:45:50.234
MARISHA: Okay, anybody need anything?

02:45:50.267 --> 02:45:52.133
SAM: Not gonna go through the--

02:45:52.167 --> 02:45:54.467

your rooms or anything?

02:45:54.501 --> 02:45:57.267
-LAURA: We'll be back here.
-SAM: Change of underwear?

02:45:57.300 --> 02:46:00.968
-TRAVIS: What's that?
-LAURA: It's all at Whitestone.

02:46:01.000 --> 02:46:03.033
We have everyone with us.

02:46:03.067 --> 02:46:05.133
Jarrett, Kash, Zahra.

02:46:05.167 --> 02:46:07.901
MATT: They've all kinda
walked along with you.

02:46:07.934 --> 02:46:09.734
LIAM: I'm just gonna
pluck another flower

02:46:09.767 --> 02:46:12.033
and tuck it behind my ear.

02:46:12.067 --> 02:46:15.200
MATT: Okay.

02:46:15.234 --> 02:46:17.534
As Keyleth steps forward
and places her hands

02:46:17.567 --> 02:46:19.868
across the base of
the tree, she focuses

02:46:19.901 --> 02:46:23.601
and it's almost like
grasping two ends of a bag

02:46:23.634 --> 02:46:26.534
and then pulling it open
with alternating zippers.

02:46:26.567 --> 02:46:30.033
You watch the bark split,
and as it opens up

02:46:30.067 --> 02:46:33.434
and crawls from floor
to the seven-foot apex,

02:46:33.467 --> 02:46:36.234
a doorway is opened temporarily,
and on the other side

02:46:36.267 --> 02:46:39.734
you immediately see the,

02:46:39.767 --> 02:46:43.400
the slow morning sun
beginning to rise

02:46:43.434 --> 02:46:47.033
in Whitestone across the city.

02:46:47.067 --> 02:46:50.834
-SAM: Jump in.
-MARISHA: Six seconds, go, go, go!

02:46:50.868 --> 02:46:52.667
MATT: You all go charging through
as fast as you can,

02:46:52.701 --> 02:46:54.601
all emerging into the center

02:46:54.634 --> 02:46:57.968
of Whitestone's central area,

02:46:58.000 --> 02:47:01.801
the twilight being slowly
cast away by the rising sun.

02:47:01.834 --> 02:47:05.501
The Sun Tree at your back as
the doorway closes behind you,

02:47:05.534 --> 02:47:09.000
and the cold air

02:47:09.033 --> 02:47:10.501
immediately catches your lungs.

02:47:10.534 --> 02:47:14.267
You've been amongst
the heat and the clouds

02:47:14.300 --> 02:47:18.434
of smoke and soot
of Emon for so long

02:47:18.467 --> 02:47:22.133
amongst the struggle,
the cold crisp air is almost

02:47:22.167 --> 02:47:25.968
a welcome moment of respite
from that experience.

02:47:26.000 --> 02:47:28.033
You look around you and
the little bits of grass

02:47:28.067 --> 02:47:31.968
have broken the cobblestone
and floor of the open area,

02:47:32.000 --> 02:47:35.868
have bits of frozen dew
across their surface,

02:47:35.901 --> 02:47:39.000
and it's this beautiful
crystal moment

02:47:39.033 --> 02:47:42.901
of peace that you didn't realize

02:47:42.934 --> 02:47:46.267
you've been seeking
for quite some time.

02:47:46.300 --> 02:47:48.801
You can see the gentle bit
of light beginning to crest

02:47:48.834 --> 02:47:51.701
over the mountains, hitting
Castle Whitestone ahead of you.

02:47:51.734 --> 02:47:54.033
You've returned.

LAURA: Well, I thought it would a
be a nightcap, but it seems

thick Parchwood Forest,

Not too large, but enough
to have once housed

02:49:38.267 --> 02:49:42.334
a very respectable royal family,

lord and lady blood.

02:49:46.701 --> 02:49:49.690

You've never been to Whitestone,
you've heard about it,

Well, this is what they call it

has a little bit of white.

Entering inside, it's
slowly beginning to rouse.

to be late teens,
early twenties physically,

02:50:22.167 --> 02:50:26.734

the wisdom that only

02:50:26.767 --> 02:50:31.267
years of trauma
and survival can hold.

02:50:31.300 --> 02:50:33.667
Her dark brunette hair with
a single shock of white

02:51:21.534 --> 02:51:25.367
-We've had a good day.
-MARISHA: We're not dead.

02:51:25.400 --> 02:51:28.501
MATT: "I can see that,
and I'm quite thankful.

02:51:28.534 --> 02:51:31.934
Um, your friend, I don't
believe I've had the honor."

02:51:31.968 --> 02:51:35.868
-MARISHA: Oh yeah, this is Ker.
-PATRICK: Am I still like--

02:51:35.901 --> 02:51:39.501
do I look like Brian Blessed
who's just been through,

02:51:39.534 --> 02:51:42.567
like, a bloody fucking massacre?

02:51:42.601 --> 02:51:44.901
-Am I still like--
-MATT: All of you do.

02:51:44.934 --> 02:51:48.801
All of you right now
are just wrecked.

02:51:48.834 --> 02:51:52.400
-PATRICK: Okay.
-MATT: Like still,

02:51:52.434 --> 02:51:54.801
still shiny from
like oils and sweat.

02:51:54.834 --> 02:51:59.033
There's still like
smeared ash and--

02:51:59.067 --> 02:52:03.067
PATRICK: It's probably not until
right then where I'm like,

02:52:03.100 --> 02:52:06.300
I am, I am a fucking mess.

02:52:06.334 --> 02:52:10.501
I'm like up to
elbows bloody, yeah.

02:52:10.534 --> 02:52:13.601
-TALIESIN: You fit right in here.
-PATRICK: Yeah, okay.

02:52:13.634 --> 02:52:15.701
MATT: "I've not had the pleasure."

02:52:15.734 --> 02:52:17.601
PATRICK: Ker, it's a pleasure
to meet you.

02:52:17.634 --> 02:52:19.868
LAURA: How did you know we
were here, Cassandra?

02:52:19.901 --> 02:52:23.868
MATT: "The guards went
and summoned me.

02:52:23.901 --> 02:52:26.200
To be perfectly honest,
I don't usually rouse

02:52:26.234 --> 02:52:30.000
so early in the morning,
but this is good news.

02:52:30.033 --> 02:52:31.934
And to be perfectly honest,
the last few times

02:52:31.968 --> 02:52:33.467
the guards have summoned
me with your arrival,

02:52:33.501 --> 02:52:35.868
they've been with
a bit of a scare.

02:52:35.901 --> 02:52:39.300
So, um, it's an absolute
pleasure to make

02:52:39.334 --> 02:52:42.467
your acquaintance, Ker,
you are welcome here.

02:52:42.501 --> 02:52:45.801
Any friends of my friends
are a friend of mine."

02:52:45.834 --> 02:52:49.100
LAURA: Can we roll an insight check
to see if it's really her?

02:52:49.133 --> 02:52:50.601
-LIAM: Sure.
-MATT: Sure, roll an insight check.

02:52:50.634 --> 02:52:53.667
-LAURA: I don't trust anybody now.
-TRAVIS: Me too, it was my idea.

02:52:53.701 --> 02:52:57.133
LIAM: You've burned us too
many times, Matt.

02:52:57.167 --> 02:53:00.968
-LAURA: Twenty-five.
-LIAM: She's a beholder.

02:53:01.000 --> 02:53:02.767
TRAVIS: Four.

02:53:06.200 --> 02:53:08.200
-LAURA: This is just a ruse.
-SAM: Secrets!

02:53:08.234 --> 02:53:11.734
LAURA: It's not gonna be Raishan.

02:53:11.767 --> 02:53:14.767
(laughing)

02:53:19.734 --> 02:53:22.234
Go team.

02:53:22.267 --> 02:53:25.267
MATT: Suddenly suffers how much psychic damage?

02:53:29.567 --> 02:53:32.033
-SAM: Vex.
-LAURA: Huh?

02:53:32.067 --> 02:53:34.734
Do you think this would be my
reaction if it was Raishan?

02:53:34.767 --> 02:53:37.367
(laughing)

02:53:37.400 --> 02:53:40.834
MATT: "Well, rest."

02:53:40.868 --> 02:53:43.634
TALIESIN: Have a bit a of drink,
we're going to rest, and then--

02:53:43.667 --> 02:53:46.934
MATT: "Well, you know where
we keep the wine."

02:53:46.968 --> 02:53:49.601
LAURA: ♪ Bloody Marys ♪

02:53:49.634 --> 02:53:52.467
♪ Mimosas ♪♪

02:53:52.501 --> 02:53:54.701
MATT: "Are we expecting more
or is it just you?"

02:53:54.734 --> 02:53:58.100
-TALIESIN: Did Vex just do that?
-SAM: It's just us for now.

02:53:58.133 --> 02:54:01.590
-I think--
-TRAVIS: It's just us, yeah.

02:54:01.590 --> 02:54:04.200
SAM: They never gave our
airship any instructions.

02:54:04.234 --> 02:54:08.234
I guess it's just
roaming the countryside.

02:54:08.267 --> 02:54:11.334
TRAVIS: It's just us this time, I know
we usually have a lot in tow--

02:54:11.367 --> 02:54:13.734
SAM: Oh, and we don't need to--
well, do we need to keep

02:54:13.767 --> 02:54:15.734
the force field up
around the city anymore?

02:54:15.767 --> 02:54:19.067
TALIESIN: No, everything's--we can
stand down at this point.

02:54:19.100 --> 02:54:21.734
It's time for everything
to rest briefly.

02:54:21.767 --> 02:54:24.834
-LAURA: We need to wake Allura.
-TALIESIN: We do need to wake Allura.

02:54:24.868 --> 02:54:27.400
MATT: "All right, I'll
have her roused.

02:54:27.434 --> 02:54:30.200
The rest of you, if you wish,
I could have baths drawn.

02:54:30.234 --> 02:54:32.968
I think you could use it."

02:54:33.000 --> 02:54:36.601
-TALIESIN: What are you trying to imply?
-MATT: "Brother."

02:54:36.634 --> 02:54:39.067
TALIESIN: I know, I know,
you owe me--I owe one.

02:54:39.100 --> 02:54:42.033
LIAM: You don't like
Dragon Age splatter?

02:54:42.067 --> 02:54:45.534
(laughing)

02:54:45.567 --> 02:54:47.434
TRAVIS: Paintbrush of gore.

02:54:47.467 --> 02:54:51.267
MATT: "I mean no disrespect,
but as a lady

02:54:51.300 --> 02:54:55.100
of esteemed blood, you
are all a terrible mess."

02:54:55.133 --> 02:54:59.701
TALIESIN: I am going to walk right up
to her, give her a big hug.

02:54:59.734 --> 02:55:02.434
MATT: "No, no, no, no!"

02:55:02.467 --> 02:55:04.964
And for a second, for
a second you see a glimmer

02:55:04.964 --> 02:55:07.767
of the young sister
that grew up with Percy

02:55:07.801 --> 02:55:10.934
fighting him off,
and she pushes him off.

02:55:10.968 --> 02:55:13.834
(laughing)

02:55:13.868 --> 02:55:16.400
"Thank you."

02:55:16.434 --> 02:55:20.667
TALIESIN: I am going to be owed for much
more than that, I'm well aware.

02:55:20.701 --> 02:55:23.234
MATT: "Yes, yes, you are.

02:55:23.267 --> 02:55:25.834
-I'm glad you're back."
-TALIESIN: It's good to be home.

02:55:25.868 --> 02:55:28.734
MATT: "All right, I'll have
Allura brought to you.

02:55:28.767 --> 02:55:31.400
Rest well, should you
require anything, I'll be

02:55:31.434 --> 02:55:35.367
in my chambers
waking properly."

02:55:35.400 --> 02:55:37.067
She leaves the room.

♪

02:55:40.300 --> 02:55:43.133

little scraps of food

as they were available,
a full breakfast meal

02:55:45.334 --> 02:55:49.367
is properly prepared
for you, warm food.

and we're clean?

02:55:51.701 --> 02:55:55.901
MATT: Yeah, you guys take time
just being cleaned properly.

MARISHA: My hair is still
singed short again.

SAM: Before we part
ways with Jarrett,

02:56:03.100 --> 02:56:06.434
I'd like to pull him
aside a little bit.

02:56:06.467 --> 02:56:08.901
MATT: As you pull Jarrett aside,
you get but a few steps away

02:56:08.934 --> 02:56:10.767
and he goes, "I'm
not doing it again."

02:56:10.801 --> 02:56:13.434
SAM: I know, I know.

02:56:13.467 --> 02:56:16.567
I just wanted to thank
you for your efforts,

02:56:16.601 --> 02:56:20.167
and, you know, it really
meant a lot to me,

02:56:20.200 --> 02:56:23.734
and I'm gonna cast
an eighth level

modify memory on you.

(laughing)

02:56:29.500 --> 02:56:31.501
-TALIESIN: What?
-TRAVIS: I love him so much.

02:56:31.534 --> 02:56:33.857
MARISHA: You still have an
eighth level spell?

level spell left?

MATT: Okay, okay.

02:56:47.067 --> 02:56:49.534
LAURA: I don't even feel
bad that he died now.

02:56:49.567 --> 02:56:52.133
MATT: Is this through the hand cone,
because that's a whole--

02:56:52.167 --> 02:56:54.400
-that's not subtle.
-SAM: No, it would not be subtle,

02:56:54.434 --> 02:56:57.267
-so I cannot do the hand cone.
-MATT: That's okay, he rolled a five.

02:56:57.300 --> 02:57:00.167
So, what are you modifying?

02:57:00.200 --> 02:57:04.701
SAM: When he delivered
the suude to me,

02:57:04.734 --> 02:57:07.734
I thanked him for it
and I went into a--

02:57:07.767 --> 02:57:10.067
I'm implanting this
memory in his head.

02:57:10.100 --> 02:57:12.501
I told him why I
needed it so badly,

02:57:12.534 --> 02:57:15.167
and it was a very sad tale

02:57:15.200 --> 02:57:18.400
of how a goblin killed my
mother and the image haunts me

02:57:18.434 --> 02:57:21.767
to this day and I can't
get through a night--

02:57:21.801 --> 02:57:25.567
I can't function without
some sort of sustenance.

02:57:25.601 --> 02:57:29.701
He felt terrible for me and
vowed to get me more, much more.

02:57:29.734 --> 02:57:31.767
(laughing)

02:57:31.801 --> 02:57:34.367
And at that time,

02:57:34.400 --> 02:57:37.434
I gave him 50 platinum.

02:57:37.467 --> 02:57:40.701
TRAVIS: Holy shit, you're
turning into a drug lord.

02:57:40.734 --> 02:57:45.067
SAM: Which he finds in his pocket
now, because I gave it to him.

02:57:45.100 --> 02:57:48.133
TALIESIN: We have met the
enemy, oh my god.

02:57:48.167 --> 02:57:50.434

-SAM: And he feels for me.

02:57:50.467 --> 02:57:53.634

02:57:53.667 --> 02:57:57.067

(crosstalk)

02:58:01.234 --> 02:58:04.133
SAM: I broke down and he's never
seen me break down like that.

02:58:04.167 --> 02:58:06.033
-MATT: No, he hasn't.
-SAM: In his mind anyway.

02:58:06.067 --> 02:58:08.534
-MATT: He hasn't, and--
-TALIESIN: Wow!

02:58:08.567 --> 02:58:11.667
-TRAVIS: Outstanding.
-TALIESIN: I can't--what?

02:58:11.701 --> 02:58:13.868
-MATT: Okay.
-SAM: That's that.

02:58:13.901 --> 02:58:16.601
MATT: All right, and at which
point you watch as his eyes

02:58:16.634 --> 02:58:19.094
kind of glaze over for a moment.

02:58:19.094 --> 02:58:22.000
He was about to make his way
towards getting his own shower.

02:58:22.033 --> 02:58:24.901
He let everybody else go first,
and he kinda stops for a second

02:58:24.934 --> 02:58:28.200
and his eyes glaze over, and
he kinda blinks for a second.

02:58:28.234 --> 02:58:31.100
"Well, I understand these
have been very trying days.

02:58:31.133 --> 02:58:34.300
If there's anything I can
do to help, let me know."

02:58:34.334 --> 02:58:36.334
SAM: You know how to help.

02:58:36.367 --> 02:58:39.334
(laughing)

02:58:39.367 --> 02:58:42.234
MATT: And you see the look in his
eyes that you've seen before,

02:58:42.267 --> 02:58:45.367
which is the, I don't do this,

02:58:45.400 --> 02:58:47.601
I barely know how to do this,

02:58:47.634 --> 02:58:50.367
and the connections I have,

02:58:50.400 --> 02:58:52.901
it's, it's gonna be hard.

02:58:52.934 --> 02:58:55.234
And you see this look, but
as opposed--where previously

02:58:55.267 --> 02:58:57.367
it was, I can't
do this anymore.

02:58:57.400 --> 02:58:59.901
He goes--he reaches up,
touches your shoulder and goes,

02:58:59.934 --> 02:59:02.133
"I'll do what I can."

02:59:02.167 --> 02:59:04.167
SAM: That's all I ask.

02:59:04.200 --> 02:59:06.367
LIAM: Yeah, Mr. Shorthalt, yeah.

02:59:06.400 --> 02:59:09.734
-TRAVIS: Meat man coming.
-MARISHA: What the fuck?

02:59:09.767 --> 02:59:12.300
SAM: Rest well, Jarrett, thank
you for your brave battle.

02:59:12.334 --> 02:59:16.000
MARISHA: Oh my god, oh my god.

02:59:16.033 --> 02:59:20.534
MATT: "Just so you know, I'm
expecting a raise, 'cause, uh,

02:59:20.567 --> 02:59:23.601
I kinda almost died like twice.

02:59:23.634 --> 02:59:25.033
It's ridiculous."

02:59:25.067 --> 02:59:26.734
SAM: You should've seen me.

02:59:26.767 --> 02:59:27.948
I did.

02:59:30.000 --> 02:59:32.067
MATT: "I'll see what I can do."

02:59:32.100 --> 02:59:34.334
Then he goes and
leaves to take a bath.

02:59:34.367 --> 02:59:36.267
LIAM: We were all taking baths, right?

02:59:36.300 --> 02:59:39.367
And they're like big royal baths
'cause this is Whitestone?

02:59:39.400 --> 02:59:42.000
MATT: Yeah, there's maybe four
at any given point in time.

02:59:42.033 --> 02:59:44.100
So you guys still have
to kinda take turns.

02:59:44.133 --> 02:59:47.934
LIAM: Excellent, I take
mine very quickly,

02:59:47.968 --> 02:59:52.167
and walk in the buck, and
I find Percival's bath,

02:59:52.200 --> 02:59:54.901
and silently walk
in while he's bathing,

02:59:54.934 --> 02:59:57.901
and I sit in the bath
on the other side,

02:59:57.934 --> 03:00:00.467
and just stare for a minute.

03:00:00.501 --> 03:00:01.968

TALIESIN: I would agree, although,
again, I'm in a bath

03:00:19.734 --> 03:00:21.334
at the moment...

03:00:22.934 --> 03:00:24.300
Cut to it, I think,

03:00:24.334 --> 03:00:26.188
I was really
working on something.

MATT: So, after you've all come--

03:03:53.934 --> 03:03:56.167
finished bathing, come down
to get your breakfast,

03:03:56.200 --> 03:03:57.601
and you've all kinda
gathered around the table

03:03:57.634 --> 03:04:00.701
and there's, you know, chatter,
that sort of,

03:04:00.734 --> 03:04:02.701
the release after
so many nerves built up

03:04:02.734 --> 03:04:04.734
even though there is
still things to tackle,

03:04:04.767 --> 03:04:07.868
there is a moment
of kinship and respite

03:04:07.901 --> 03:04:10.317
and, honestly, Ker,

03:04:10.317 --> 03:04:12.167
it's a little strange
for you at first.

03:04:12.200 --> 03:04:16.467
You--such jovial atmosphere

03:04:16.501 --> 03:04:19.234
in the face of such...

03:04:19.267 --> 03:04:23.634
you know, recent tragedy
and trauma

03:04:23.667 --> 03:04:26.400
reminds you of back
when you used to do this.

03:04:26.434 --> 03:04:29.334
And it's weirdly welcome.

03:04:29.367 --> 03:04:31.033
You know, it's very humanizing,

03:04:31.067 --> 03:04:35.567
and there's a brotherhood
that comes after battle

03:04:35.601 --> 03:04:38.041
that you can only describe
if you've been there.

03:04:38.041 --> 03:04:39.667
And it's been a while
since you've had

03:04:39.701 --> 03:04:41.033
this type of brotherhood.

03:04:41.067 --> 03:04:43.494
And even though you're quiet
amongst their chatter,

03:04:43.494 --> 03:04:46.033
and they are a family
that you're outside of,

03:04:46.067 --> 03:04:47.868
you can't fight the smile.

03:04:47.901 --> 03:04:50.033
PATRICK: Oh, no, it's--this is--

03:04:50.067 --> 03:04:52.667
and actually it's, you know,

03:04:52.701 --> 03:04:56.467
it's very nice to watch
like, you know--

03:04:56.501 --> 03:04:59.701
It did not stay
like this for me,

03:04:59.734 --> 03:05:02.267
and it's obviously
staying like this for them.

03:05:02.300 --> 03:05:04.534
And so, yeah, I'm very happy.

03:05:04.567 --> 03:05:08.200
And honestly,
if there is liquor here,

03:05:08.234 --> 03:05:10.734
I probably do not stay
very quiet for long.

03:05:10.767 --> 03:05:13.868
(laughing)

03:05:13.901 --> 03:05:15.033

03:05:15.067 --> 03:05:16.701

03:05:18.834 --> 03:05:20.234
TALIESIN: One of my Brit friends--

03:05:20.267 --> 03:05:22.267
actually, were you at
that breakfast at Comic Con

03:05:22.300 --> 03:05:23.501
where we went to the pub

03:05:23.534 --> 03:05:24.968
and he said, Do you have
any breakfast beer?

03:05:25.000 --> 03:05:26.934
What do you have on
the breakfast beer menu?

03:05:26.968 --> 03:05:28.400
TRAVIS: Yeah, if Ker
is with the liquor

03:05:28.434 --> 03:05:29.901
and not being quiet,

03:05:29.934 --> 03:05:32.000
-I'm probably with him.
-MATT: All right, well,

03:05:32.033 --> 03:05:36.968
you watch as Ker comes back
with two bottles

03:05:37.000 --> 03:05:40.727
after being given directions
as to where the...

03:05:40.727 --> 03:05:41.667
(bottle pops)

03:05:41.667 --> 03:05:42.901
Just like that.

03:05:42.934 --> 03:05:45.033
(laughing)

03:05:46.968 --> 03:05:49.934
A bottle in each hand,
and each of you grab a bottle,

03:05:49.968 --> 03:05:53.467
and kinda toast
the bottle itself.

03:05:53.501 --> 03:05:55.144
You're gonna drink.

03:05:55.144 --> 03:05:56.868
Is there anything
you guys wanna discuss

03:05:56.901 --> 03:05:58.637
while you're having breakfast?

03:05:59.901 --> 03:06:01.501
TRAVIS: We're not worried
about the spinning

03:06:01.534 --> 03:06:02.801
dirt button of death, right?

03:06:02.834 --> 03:06:05.000
It's fine down there,
like it's--

03:06:05.033 --> 03:06:06.400
TALIESIN: I think it's on the list,

03:06:06.434 --> 03:06:09.634
but we have a list,
we can slow down a bit.

03:06:09.667 --> 03:06:12.934
SAM: What is our list,
'cause, I mean--

03:06:12.968 --> 03:06:15.234
so here's what
I got on my list.

03:06:15.267 --> 03:06:16.601
It's not very long.

03:06:16.634 --> 03:06:19.434
Bury a hand in Vasselheim.

03:06:19.467 --> 03:06:21.534
LAURA: No, bury ashes in Vasselheim.

03:06:21.567 --> 03:06:22.601

03:06:22.634 --> 03:06:24.667
LAURA: The hand was return the hand.

03:06:24.701 --> 03:06:26.467

03:06:32.443 --> 03:06:34.400
I don't need to know,
I just wanted to see

03:06:34.434 --> 03:06:38.334
-if I was doing it right.
-SAM: Bury ashes in Vasselheim.

03:06:38.367 --> 03:06:41.400
-Find Opash, go to--
-TALIESIN: Island of Opash.

03:06:41.434 --> 03:06:44.033
-SAM: Go to Wildmount.
-LAURA: Both, yes.

03:06:44.067 --> 03:06:46.434
-SAM: Is that the same thing?
-LAURA: No.

03:06:46.467 --> 03:06:49.467
SAM: Well, what--which one do we do?

03:06:49.501 --> 03:06:51.167
LAURA: Well, Vasselheim is--

03:06:51.200 --> 03:06:53.601
is Vasselheim north--
close to Wildmount?

03:06:53.634 --> 03:06:55.200
-TALIESIN:Nothing is north--
-MATT: No, opposite side.

03:06:55.234 --> 03:06:58.901
-LAURA: Oh, well, shit.
-MATT: Vasselheim's to the northwest.

03:06:58.934 --> 03:07:02.734
Wildmount is the east--
northeast of Tal'Dorei.

03:07:02.767 --> 03:07:05.467
TRAVIS: We may find more
about Opash in Wildmount.

03:07:05.501 --> 03:07:07.901
LAURA: Zahra's from Wildmount.

03:07:07.934 --> 03:07:08.934
MATT: Uhh.

03:07:08.968 --> 03:07:11.067
-TRAVIS: Is she?
-LAURA: Originally, I think.

03:07:11.100 --> 03:07:12.801
MATT: Maybe--you'd have
to check with Zahra.

03:07:12.834 --> 03:07:15.801
LAURA: I think she is--when she told me
her history, I think it was.

03:07:15.834 --> 03:07:17.033
MATT: Sure, there we go.

03:07:17.067 --> 03:07:19.400
TRAVIS: What else is on your list?

03:07:19.434 --> 03:07:21.834
-SAM: Uh--
-LAURA: Ooh, and the boys!

03:07:21.868 --> 03:07:23.734
The boys.

03:07:23.767 --> 03:07:25.200
SAM: Oh, the little boys!

03:07:25.234 --> 03:07:28.300
LAURA: Yeah, the little angel babies,
they're from Wildmount.

03:07:28.334 --> 03:07:29.834
SAM: Where are they--
where did we leave them?

03:07:29.868 --> 03:07:31.834
-LAURA: They're here.
-SAM: Oh, okay.

03:07:31.868 --> 03:07:34.000
TRAVIS: Where did we leave them?

03:07:34.033 --> 03:07:35.634
TALIESIN: On the side of the road.

03:07:35.667 --> 03:07:37.400
SAM: Any other to-do list items?

03:07:37.434 --> 03:07:39.501
TALIESIN: We have a demon.

03:07:39.534 --> 03:07:41.400
LAURA: Oh, God, we have Hotis,

03:07:41.434 --> 03:07:46.300
and the other demon that
we fought in the City of Brass.

03:07:46.334 --> 03:07:50.400
LIAM: We've got time on that--
how long has it been Hotis-wise?

03:07:50.434 --> 03:07:53.934
MATT: Hotis-wise,
it's been a few weeks.

03:07:53.968 --> 03:07:55.868
-LIAM: We've got time.
-SAM: Is there another one?

03:07:55.901 --> 03:07:57.834
-TALIESIN: No.
-LAURA: The ambassador

03:07:57.868 --> 03:08:01.267
to the Nine Hells
was in the City of Brass,

03:08:01.300 --> 03:08:04.133
and we killed him,
and he's gonna hate us.

03:08:04.167 --> 03:08:06.191
-SAM: Wait, he can come back?
-LAURA: I think so!

03:08:06.191 --> 03:08:07.834
-TRAVIS: Hotis, oh, yeah.
-SAM: Well, we can't do anything

03:08:07.868 --> 03:08:09.767
about that.

03:08:10.968 --> 03:08:13.267
MATT: Make an arcana check, Sam.

03:08:15.834 --> 03:08:19.634
SAM: Uh, more than 20--23.

03:08:19.667 --> 03:08:21.000
MATT: Twenty-three.

03:08:21.033 --> 03:08:25.868
Umm, best that you know,

03:08:25.901 --> 03:08:30.534
as far as like hierarchies
and devils in that plane,

03:08:30.567 --> 03:08:35.100
a devil as high-ranking as
the one that you guys fought

03:08:35.133 --> 03:08:37.834
that got its ass handed to it
by a bunch of random people

03:08:37.868 --> 03:08:42.200
in the City of Brass
is considered such a slight

03:08:42.234 --> 03:08:45.400
in the eyes of the hierarchy
of the Nine Hells,

03:08:45.434 --> 03:08:48.634
that devil probably
has been punished

03:08:48.667 --> 03:08:50.767
stripped of its power,

03:08:50.801 --> 03:08:55.400
and is not something you
probably need to worry about.

on our to-do list.

TALIESIN: I have a bit of...

03:09:09.033 --> 03:09:11.334
I have a bit of work to do
around the house, so to speak.

03:09:11.367 --> 03:09:13.534
There's a few matters
that have to be tended to here

03:09:13.567 --> 03:09:15.834
that we should at least
get up and started, but...

03:09:15.868 --> 03:09:18.968
-MARISHA: I mean, I feel like...
-TALIESIN: ...nothing's urgent.

green dragon in the room

is pretty urgent.

but it's not something

03:09:25.901 --> 03:09:27.701

solved tomorrow.

03:09:27.734 --> 03:09:28.901
It's not something
that's necessarily

03:09:28.934 --> 03:09:30.133
going to bite us tomorrow.

03:09:30.167 --> 03:09:32.100
I think it's going
to bite us, honestly--

03:09:32.133 --> 03:09:33.701
if we left it alone,
I think we would be

03:09:33.734 --> 03:09:36.000
reaping the damage of it
in six months.

MATT: "Preferably no biting at all."

03:09:37.667 --> 03:09:39.133
As you look,
you see at the table,

03:09:39.167 --> 03:09:41.701
her hair kinda pulled up
into these small circles

03:09:41.734 --> 03:09:44.968
at the bottom of her head--
you see Allura, um,

03:09:45.000 --> 03:09:47.267
with just kinda
like a nightrobe on.

with blondish, light hair

03:09:56.467 --> 03:09:58.167
that's been braided
into long braids

03:09:58.200 --> 03:09:59.267
and then curled up into

03:09:59.300 --> 03:10:02.334
these small little balls
underneath

03:10:02.367 --> 03:10:07.033
with like a dark blue--
almost shimmering materials

03:10:07.067 --> 03:10:09.901
are her robe.

03:10:09.934 --> 03:10:12.834
She steps in a sits down
across from you guys

03:10:12.868 --> 03:10:14.234
at the other end of the table

03:10:14.267 --> 03:10:15.367
and begins taking them out

03:10:15.400 --> 03:10:18.100

rebraiding them.

"I'm very happy to see
that you're all safe.

to maintain the illusory barrier
over Whitestone,

03:10:30.534 --> 03:10:34.300
which is of great relief to me

03:10:34.334 --> 03:10:38.133
as that's been draining.

03:10:38.167 --> 03:10:41.701
I have also heard
that Thordak has fallen,

03:10:41.734 --> 03:10:44.300
so congratulations
are in order."

a replacement flying carpet.

in our battles to come.

when I have my tower rebuilt,

03:11:08.033 --> 03:11:10.467
then perhaps we'll find
the right place for it

03:11:10.501 --> 03:11:12.567
where it matches the rest
of the furniture.

03:11:12.601 --> 03:11:14.033
Until then, hold onto it."

a tacky color, though.

the past few years,

on the island of Opash.

was banished to, that is.

in ... we'll check.

the name of the island

after Thordak
was long thought dead,

reemerged after spending

a few--as far as you know--

03:13:16.701 --> 03:13:18.934
years, decades,

03:13:18.968 --> 03:13:23.968
centuries, possibly,
rebuilding his domain

03:13:24.000 --> 03:13:28.200
on what was called
the island of Viscon.

Now, I know this island is--
it was part of our research

began to attack

of Tal'Dorei

our focus was more
to banish the creature

into the center of its home,

03:14:34.000 --> 03:14:38.033

do I know anything about Opash?

03:14:51.767 --> 03:14:57.133
Like necromancer working
against the natural order?

Uhh, 17.

03:15:05.467 --> 03:15:06.767
MATT: Seventeen.

03:15:06.801 --> 03:15:11.267
I mean, you've--
you've come across

03:15:11.300 --> 03:15:13.634
a modicum of necromancy
in your years--

03:15:13.667 --> 03:15:15.901
your younger years, at least.

03:15:15.934 --> 03:15:23.901
Usually, low level,
employed by various tribal sages

03:15:23.934 --> 03:15:26.567
and wandering,
marauding hordes of orcs

03:15:26.601 --> 03:15:30.267
or knolls that were, you know,
given positions of power

03:15:30.300 --> 03:15:31.767
within their small cultures,

03:15:31.801 --> 03:15:33.167
because they had
begun to harness

03:15:33.200 --> 03:15:35.000
some of the powers
of life and death,

03:15:35.033 --> 03:15:39.501
but nothing that really
left a lasting impression.

03:15:39.534 --> 03:15:43.868
There was one tomb
that you excavated

03:15:43.901 --> 03:15:49.067
that it was beyond
the southern lands

03:15:49.100 --> 03:15:52.434
of the Stormcrest Mountains.

03:15:52.467 --> 03:15:55.100
It was in
the Reifenmist Peninsula,

03:15:55.133 --> 03:15:58.467
which is the thick
jungles that exist

03:15:58.501 --> 03:16:01.734
on the southern peninsula
of Tal'Dorei,

03:16:01.767 --> 03:16:02.934
below the countryside,

03:16:02.968 --> 03:16:04.601
below the actual
political structure.

03:16:04.634 --> 03:16:07.200
It's a free land,
it is beyond the rule

03:16:07.234 --> 03:16:09.234
of Tal'Dorei or Syngorn,

03:16:09.267 --> 03:16:13.033
and it is where refugees
flee from society.

03:16:13.067 --> 03:16:15.334
It's where folks that want
to live beyond the law

03:16:15.367 --> 03:16:17.767
go and build their own place,

03:16:17.801 --> 03:16:20.534
but south of that
into the jungle,

03:16:20.567 --> 03:16:24.968
there are many lost
and ancient places

03:16:25.000 --> 03:16:27.501
that were either
forgotten intentionally,

03:16:27.534 --> 03:16:29.033
or buried through time

03:16:29.067 --> 03:16:32.000
as the founding
to the age of Arcanum

03:16:32.033 --> 03:16:34.501
in these eons past and past.

03:16:34.534 --> 03:16:36.434
There is one tomb
that you went to

03:16:36.467 --> 03:16:40.033
that was steeped
in heavy necromancy

03:16:40.067 --> 03:16:42.200
and even just
a short journey in,

03:16:42.234 --> 03:16:44.501
you lost two friends,

03:16:44.534 --> 03:16:47.667
watching the life sucked
from their corpses,

03:16:47.701 --> 03:16:54.033
left behind just these
dust-skinned skeletal memories,

03:16:54.067 --> 03:16:56.367
and you fled--you
and the remaining members

03:16:56.400 --> 03:16:58.067
of your team.

03:16:59.701 --> 03:17:02.968
Since then, you've
been keenly aware

03:17:03.000 --> 03:17:05.167
of the awful effects
of necromancy,

03:17:05.200 --> 03:17:07.601
and it honestly scares you,

03:17:07.634 --> 03:17:09.467
and so the more
this discussion continues,

03:17:09.501 --> 03:17:13.400
the more and more just uneasy
you become with the discussion.

03:17:13.434 --> 03:17:18.467
Um, as far as the essence
of what Opash may have in store,

03:17:18.501 --> 03:17:21.868
uh, you're not
particularly sure,

03:17:21.901 --> 03:17:28.000
but, um, I mean, the domain
of necromancy is life and death.

03:17:28.033 --> 03:17:32.534
Um, and that central theme

03:17:32.567 --> 03:17:35.434
keeps reemerging
with Thordak, with Raishan,

03:17:35.467 --> 03:17:36.801
with whatever this dynamic is,

03:17:36.834 --> 03:17:38.601
there's something
about life and death

03:17:38.634 --> 03:17:40.300
that is cyclical
in this conversation

03:17:40.334 --> 03:17:42.934

03:18:43.734 --> 03:18:47.734
MATT: "I'm--I don't doubt that.

03:18:47.767 --> 03:18:50.434
There is something
to be said for that, so--"

03:18:50.467 --> 03:18:52.133
SAM: More Lava, Keyleth.

03:18:52.167 --> 03:18:54.000
MARISHA: My favorite.

03:18:54.033 --> 03:18:56.667
TALIESIN: One day we're going
to meet a lava door.

03:18:58.033 --> 03:19:01.501
TRAVIS: Don't you put that evil on us.

03:19:01.534 --> 03:19:03.234
Don't even put it out there.

03:19:03.267 --> 03:19:04.968
LIAM: Matt hadn't even
thought of that!

03:19:05.000 --> 03:19:06.534
TALIESIN: Three times,
you say it three times.

03:19:06.567 --> 03:19:08.634
SAM: Door made of lava.

03:19:10.834 --> 03:19:12.567
MATT: "If you do decide to inquire,

03:19:12.601 --> 03:19:16.133
this island of Viscon,

03:19:16.167 --> 03:19:20.968
carefully, slowly, methodically,

03:19:21.000 --> 03:19:22.467
whether or not this has a tie

03:19:22.501 --> 03:19:28.868
or this is specifically
where the deceiver lives

03:19:28.901 --> 03:19:31.701
at the moment, who knows
how long they'll stay.

03:19:31.734 --> 03:19:34.801
You say she's seeking
something there?"

03:19:34.834 --> 03:19:37.033
LAURA: That's what Keyleth
said it seemed like.

03:19:37.067 --> 03:19:39.334
MARISHA: She seemed to be poring
through tomes and books

03:19:39.367 --> 03:19:40.434
looking for something.

03:19:40.467 --> 03:19:43.601
She seemed very frustrated.

03:19:43.634 --> 03:19:46.868
Question--oh, go ahead.

03:19:46.901 --> 03:19:48.234
MATT: "Let's just say,
what happens if she finds

03:19:48.267 --> 03:19:49.334
what she's looking for?"

03:19:49.367 --> 03:19:51.400
MARISHA: Exactly.

03:19:51.434 --> 03:19:57.033
PATRICK: Oh, she brings the dragon
back from the dead.

03:19:57.067 --> 03:20:00.067
TALIESIN: Or transfers her consciousness
into the dragon's body,

03:20:00.100 --> 03:20:02.033
reanimates an undead red dragon.

03:20:02.067 --> 03:20:04.000
LAURA: I don't know what necromancy
is capable of.

03:20:04.033 --> 03:20:05.734
TALIESIN: ...create some unholy monster.

03:20:05.767 --> 03:20:08.200
-PATRICK: You...
-SAM: There's also dragon babies.

03:20:08.234 --> 03:20:13.267
PATRICK: ...put into the--
into the eggs...

03:20:13.300 --> 03:20:16.501
LAURA: Hey, K, you remember when
I said you were really smart?

03:20:16.534 --> 03:20:19.534
(laughing)

03:20:19.567 --> 03:20:22.367
SAM: He makes wagon hitches,
all right?

03:20:22.400 --> 03:20:24.367
-Listen!
-LIAM: I like this guy.

03:20:24.400 --> 03:20:26.634
SAM: He's a simple man!

03:20:28.100 --> 03:20:30.334
He's a great wagon hitch maker.

03:20:30.367 --> 03:20:32.367
PATRICK: Well, I mean,
why do you take a body?

03:20:32.400 --> 03:20:34.033
I mean, well,

03:20:34.067 --> 03:20:36.267
and you're all like,
"Well, I died Tuesday,

03:20:36.300 --> 03:20:38.534
I died Thursday!"

03:20:38.567 --> 03:20:42.701
Like, and then you killed--
how bad did you kill the dragon?

03:20:42.734 --> 03:20:45.434
Because if you didn't
kill it real bad--

03:20:45.467 --> 03:20:46.501
LAURA: It could be brought back.

03:20:46.534 --> 03:20:48.267
PATRICK: Like Tuesday, right?

03:20:48.300 --> 03:20:50.567
LAURA: At least
the gem was shattered--

03:20:50.601 --> 03:20:52.100
the gem was shattered.

03:20:52.133 --> 03:20:53.367
-MATT: "It was?"
-LAURA: Yes.

03:20:53.400 --> 03:20:54.534
MATT: "You destroyed the Soul Anchor?"

03:20:54.567 --> 03:20:56.000
LAURA: Yeah, and Thordak shrunk!

03:20:56.033 --> 03:20:59.601
He was huge, and then
he was like normal after that.

03:20:59.634 --> 03:21:01.567
MATT: "Well, that's something at least."

03:21:01.601 --> 03:21:03.067
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's something.

03:21:03.100 --> 03:21:06.434
SAM: I don't think that she's trying
to reanimate Thordak.

03:21:06.467 --> 03:21:08.567
I think she's
trying to probe him

03:21:08.601 --> 03:21:10.000
for knowledge of some sort.

03:21:10.033 --> 03:21:12.901
-TRAVIS: Probe.
-TALIESIN: I think she's attempting--

03:21:12.934 --> 03:21:14.434
SAM: She's trying to probe
his dead body.

03:21:14.467 --> 03:21:16.267
TRAVIS: Probe.

03:21:18.901 --> 03:21:24.200
MARISHA: Allura, if we scried
on this island,

03:21:24.234 --> 03:21:29.567
if you saw it again,
would you recognize it?

03:21:29.601 --> 03:21:32.267
MATT: "I'm--I haven't been there,

03:21:32.300 --> 03:21:36.400
-but if I were to scry..."
-MARISHA: Oh, I thought you said...

03:21:36.434 --> 03:21:39.400
MATT: "...what would you require--
what would you need?"

03:21:39.434 --> 03:21:41.100
MARISHA: I wanna confirm
if she actually is

03:21:41.133 --> 03:21:43.868
on the island
of Viscar--Viscon.

03:21:43.901 --> 03:21:46.300
MATT: "Well, I mean, I can attempt to.

03:21:46.334 --> 03:21:48.300
I've only heard of it, so..."

03:21:49.934 --> 03:21:52.300
SAM: Do you--what if we--

03:21:52.334 --> 03:21:55.400
would it help you to scry
if we gave you some blood

03:21:55.434 --> 03:21:58.534
of the thing that
we're scrying on?

03:21:58.567 --> 03:22:00.100
LAURA: Thordak?

03:22:00.133 --> 03:22:03.100
MARISHA: But she would still see
the same thing that I would--

03:22:03.133 --> 03:22:04.267
that I would've seen.

03:22:04.300 --> 03:22:06.467
-It wouldn't confirm the island.
-LAURA: Oh, right.

03:22:06.501 --> 03:22:09.133
TALIESIN: It also might mean
that we would be discovered.

03:22:09.167 --> 03:22:11.234
SAM: Keyleth, don't you have some spell

03:22:11.267 --> 03:22:13.000
where you say
the name of a place

03:22:13.033 --> 03:22:15.033
and it shows you
the way there or something?

03:22:15.067 --> 03:22:17.167
LIAM: Well, can you look
for trees on that island?

03:22:17.200 --> 03:22:20.200
MARISHA: I could try and scry...

03:22:21.868 --> 03:22:25.693
on Viscar--Viscon.

03:22:25.693 --> 03:22:27.801
Right? If I know
enough about Viscon,

03:22:27.834 --> 03:22:30.234
I could try and scry
on a location, correct?

03:22:30.267 --> 03:22:31.701
SAM: No, you can only scry
on a person.

03:22:31.734 --> 03:22:33.367
MATT: Yup, you can scry
on a location.

03:22:33.400 --> 03:22:34.767
That was my fault
in the past, by the way.

03:22:34.801 --> 03:22:36.667
I completely--I--
very into the spell.

03:22:36.701 --> 03:22:39.567
SAM: But no, don't you have
like a directions spell?

03:22:39.601 --> 03:22:42.501
-MARISHA: Find the path, yeah.
-SAM: What does that do?

03:22:42.534 --> 03:22:45.100
MATT: Yeah, if you have
secondhand knowledge,

03:22:45.133 --> 03:22:46.701
and you've heard of the target,
you can still scry to it,

03:22:46.734 --> 03:22:49.067
it just has a modifier--
if it's a target.

03:22:49.100 --> 03:22:53.234
If it's a location, um...

03:22:53.267 --> 03:22:55.601
LAURA: But, 'cause I--will it--

03:22:55.634 --> 03:22:57.167
I mean, we lucked out
the first time

03:22:57.200 --> 03:22:58.767
that she didn't catch on.

03:22:58.801 --> 03:23:00.701
What if she realizes?

03:23:00.734 --> 03:23:03.767
MARISHA: If I scry on the island,
she won't notice.

03:23:03.801 --> 03:23:05.300
-LAURA: Okay.
-MARISHA: It's only if I scry on her.

03:23:05.334 --> 03:23:07.501
SAM: ...you're looking
at some leaves and trees.

03:23:07.534 --> 03:23:09.434
TALIESIN: But we'll get an idea
of where to go.

03:23:09.467 --> 03:23:12.067
-MARISHA: I could look--
-LIAM: You saw it once already,

03:23:12.100 --> 03:23:13.934
and you would know it--
you'd probably recognize it

03:23:13.968 --> 03:23:16.501
-a second time.
-MARISHA: Would I?

03:23:16.534 --> 03:23:18.167
-TRAVIS: Would you?
-LIAM: It's worth a fucking shot.

03:23:18.200 --> 03:23:22.400
MARISHA: If I--if I scried on Viscon,

03:23:22.434 --> 03:23:24.200
could I recognize, yeah,

03:23:24.234 --> 03:23:26.534
this looks like
the similar island?

03:23:26.567 --> 03:23:27.534
MATT: You could try, yeah.

03:23:27.567 --> 03:23:29.467
LAURA: Yeah, you could certainly try.

03:23:29.501 --> 03:23:31.434
MATT: You can certainly try.

03:23:31.467 --> 03:23:32.711
Thank you, Laura.

03:23:32.711 --> 03:23:34.155
I needed a little goose.

03:23:34.155 --> 03:23:35.690
-MARISHA: All right.
-MATT: Needed a little ...

03:23:35.690 --> 03:23:37.701
MARISHA: Last fifth-level
spell of the day.

03:23:37.734 --> 03:23:39.801
(cross talk)

03:23:42.033 --> 03:23:45.334
LAURA: Ker, you should try this wine
that Grog got from--

03:23:45.334 --> 03:23:47.033
-TRAVIS: Yes!
-MARISHA: You should try it!

03:23:47.067 --> 03:23:49.968
-TRAVIS: Oh, it's really good!
-MARISHA: It's so tasty!

03:23:50.000 --> 03:23:54.033
-TRAVIS: ...sand dunes of terribleness.
-LIAM: I mean, you don't want to--

03:23:54.067 --> 03:23:55.434
I haven't tried it either.

03:23:55.467 --> 03:23:57.328
You don't want
to finish your life

03:23:57.328 --> 03:23:58.868
without trying this bug juice.

03:23:58.901 --> 03:24:00.467
It's the nickname
we have for it.

03:24:00.501 --> 03:24:02.701
TRAVIS: I pop the top,
and I hand the bottle to him.

03:24:02.734 --> 03:24:04.868
LAURA: Just small--small amounts.

03:24:04.901 --> 03:24:08.200
TRAVIS: What is it, sand keg, sand...

03:24:08.234 --> 03:24:11.634
-LIAM: Bug juice.
-TRAVIS: Yeah, that stuff.

03:24:11.667 --> 03:24:14.167
(cross talk)

03:24:14.200 --> 03:24:15.567
LIAM: I take the bottle,
and I put my thumb over it

03:24:15.601 --> 03:24:16.601
and pretend like
I'm drinking--go--

03:24:16.601 --> 03:24:18.667
MATT: Sleight-of-hand.

03:24:18.667 --> 03:24:20.734
LIAM: That's great, sure.

03:24:22.868 --> 03:24:25.934
LIAM: Sure, sure, sure.

03:24:25.968 --> 03:24:28.267
LIAM: That is a 26.

03:24:28.300 --> 03:24:31.400
MATT: For the hell of it, Kerrek,
go ahead and roll--

03:24:31.434 --> 03:24:34.734
roll a perception check.

03:24:34.767 --> 03:24:37.734
PATRICK: Uh, no, not by--
not by a country mile.

03:24:37.767 --> 03:24:39.234
MATT: He took a mighty swig.

03:24:39.267 --> 03:24:40.901
PATRICK: Yeah, well, it's--

03:24:40.934 --> 03:24:44.033
-LAURA: Don't take a swig that big.
-PATRICK: It's that good?

03:24:44.067 --> 03:24:45.901
-LIAM: It's smooth.
-TRAVIS: It has really got

03:24:45.934 --> 03:24:47.934
-some balls on it.
-LIAM: It goes down smooth.

03:24:47.968 --> 03:24:50.200
PATRICK: You gotta shake the flavor in.

03:24:50.234 --> 03:24:51.767
(laughing)

03:24:51.801 --> 03:24:55.100
'Cause the flavor goes
slowly to the bottom.

03:24:55.133 --> 03:24:57.300
-LAURA: Oh, God, oh, no.
-PATRICK: It's 'cause of the gravity.

03:24:57.334 --> 03:24:58.868
LAURA: What if he realized
something we didn't?

03:24:58.901 --> 03:25:00.267
MARISHA: See, I told you see was wise.

03:25:00.300 --> 03:25:01.834
LIAM: I wish it could be
my first time again.

03:25:01.868 --> 03:25:05.334
MATT: So as the liquid hits
your lips, it's thick.

03:25:05.367 --> 03:25:06.801
It's like...

03:25:06.834 --> 03:25:09.033
(laughing)

03:25:09.067 --> 03:25:10.968
PATRICK: Too much flavor.

03:25:12.767 --> 03:25:14.601
MATT: It doesn't pour
like wine or liquor,

03:25:14.634 --> 03:25:16.234
it pours more like a--

03:25:16.267 --> 03:25:18.868
like a light honey.

03:25:18.901 --> 03:25:25.367
But it has
a very acrid, um...

03:25:25.400 --> 03:25:29.167
pungent, immediate flavor
as it hits your tongue.

03:25:29.200 --> 03:25:31.767
I need you to roll
a constitution saving throw.

03:25:31.801 --> 03:25:38.067
PATRICK: So is this like when I left
that glass of Surge out

03:25:38.100 --> 03:25:42.400
for so long that it
evaporated in the cup down?

03:25:42.434 --> 03:25:43.868
-TRAVIS: Just, like, ...
-MATT: Kind of, yeah.

03:25:43.901 --> 03:25:48.501
PATRICK: And then because there
was no mold growing on it,

03:25:48.534 --> 03:25:50.968
and I am a scientist at heart...

03:25:51.000 --> 03:25:52.100
TRAVIS: It's all clear.

03:25:52.133 --> 03:25:53.734
TALIESIN: You went where mold
feared to tread.

03:25:53.767 --> 03:25:55.667
PATRICK: I, uh--I thought,

03:25:55.701 --> 03:25:57.834
when will I ever have
this opportunity again?

03:25:57.868 --> 03:25:59.467
MATT: When the most basic
forms of life

03:25:59.501 --> 03:26:01.701
eschew existing on a substance,

03:26:01.734 --> 03:26:03.767
that's when you
have to drink it.

03:26:03.801 --> 03:26:05.634
TRAVIS: Agreed.

03:26:05.667 --> 03:26:09.033
TALIESIN: Yes, yes!

03:26:09.067 --> 03:26:11.801
PATRICK: That's gonna be
my best role all year.

03:26:11.834 --> 03:26:14.267
MATT: So--so--

03:26:14.300 --> 03:26:16.334
LIAM: Wait, can I point out

03:26:16.367 --> 03:26:19.033
that this is the best game
in existence?

03:26:19.067 --> 03:26:19.847
(laughing)

03:26:19.847 --> 03:26:20.927
MATT: You may.

03:26:23.367 --> 03:26:24.667
As it fills your gullet,

03:26:24.701 --> 03:26:26.868
the warm, burning sensation
you're used to

03:26:26.901 --> 03:26:29.200
with fine,
heavy liquors is surpassed

03:26:29.234 --> 03:26:35.000
by the ever-burning sensation
of fire within your lungs,

03:26:35.033 --> 03:26:37.300
and as the heartburn
begins to kick in,

03:26:37.334 --> 03:26:39.334
you stop for a second and
realize that the burn goes away

03:26:39.367 --> 03:26:41.367
and everything goes numb.

03:26:41.400 --> 03:26:42.701
Everything goes numb.

03:26:42.734 --> 03:26:47.167
Your tongue...your jaw...

03:26:47.200 --> 03:26:48.834
LAURA: How do you feel, Ker?

03:26:53.200 --> 03:26:55.200
(indistinct speech)

03:26:55.234 --> 03:26:57.567
(laughing)

03:27:00.467 --> 03:27:02.067
LIAM: One more time?

03:27:05.501 --> 03:27:07.400
SAM: Beard got in the way.

03:27:10.267 --> 03:27:12.934
(indistinct speech)

03:27:12.968 --> 03:27:16.167
(laughing)

03:27:16.200 --> 03:27:17.901
LAURA: He likes it--
I think he likes it.

03:27:17.934 --> 03:27:19.267
LIAM: I would've thought that as well.

03:27:19.300 --> 03:27:20.334
TALIESIN: Ladies and gentlemen,
Burning Man,

03:27:20.367 --> 03:27:21.400
ladies and gentlemen.

03:27:21.434 --> 03:27:23.267
Welcome to Burning Man.

03:27:23.300 --> 03:27:25.434
TRAVIS: That is good shit.

03:27:25.467 --> 03:27:27.667
MARISHA: The fire has passed through you.

03:27:27.701 --> 03:27:31.267
(laughing)

03:27:31.300 --> 03:27:33.734
It's gonna go
all the way through you.

03:27:33.767 --> 03:27:35.534
So be careful when it
comes out the other end.

03:27:35.567 --> 03:27:37.300
LIAM: Good reincorporation!

03:27:37.334 --> 03:27:39.300
(laughing)

03:27:41.934 --> 03:27:43.701
TALIESIN: I remember this.

03:27:43.734 --> 03:27:46.367
LAURA: But you're still conscious,
and that is saying something.

03:27:46.400 --> 03:27:48.601
TRAVIS: Really impressive.

03:27:48.634 --> 03:27:50.033
LAURA: I wouldn't drink
any more of it, though.

03:27:50.067 --> 03:27:51.167
TRAVIS: No, no, no, yeah,
you gotta warm up

03:27:51.200 --> 03:27:52.367
-and then take another one.
-LIAM: No, no, no,

03:27:52.400 --> 03:27:54.901
I mean, that's all fun
and games, but come on.

03:27:56.701 --> 03:27:58.200
MATT: As this is happening,
you all look over

03:27:58.234 --> 03:28:00.133
and glance that, as Allura
has cleared the table

03:28:00.167 --> 03:28:02.667
and begun to set a space
for the scry ritual,

03:28:02.701 --> 03:28:04.934
-is just staring at you all.
-LAURA: Oh, shit, right.

03:28:04.968 --> 03:28:07.601
MARISHA: Thanks for setting
this up for us, Allura.

03:28:07.634 --> 03:28:09.601
-MATT: "Oh, please, keep going."
-TRAVIS: We didn't mean to be rude.

03:28:09.634 --> 03:28:10.868
MATT: "This is the most fun
I've had in days."

03:28:10.901 --> 03:28:13.300
TRAVIS: Do you want some?

03:28:13.334 --> 03:28:14.467
TALIESIN: After!

03:28:14.501 --> 03:28:17.434
(yelling)

03:28:17.467 --> 03:28:20.400
LIAM: No, that's a bad idea,
don't do it!

03:28:20.434 --> 03:28:21.801
-TRAVIS: Do it.
-SAM: She needs to do the spell!

03:28:21.834 --> 03:28:24.133
LIAM: Do it later--
that shit's fucked up.

03:28:24.167 --> 03:28:25.801
TRAVIS: Don't listen to him.

03:28:25.834 --> 03:28:26.934
MARISHA: Wait, I thought
I was doing the spell.

03:28:26.968 --> 03:28:28.734
We could do it together.

03:28:28.767 --> 03:28:30.834
TRAVIS: We're trustworthy.
Open the bottle.

03:28:30.868 --> 03:28:33.501
-Down the hatch.
-MATT: She pops it off, and goes,

03:28:33.534 --> 03:28:36.067
"Look, it's morning,
we're all alive.

03:28:36.100 --> 03:28:37.334
What's the point if
we're not celebrating?"

03:28:37.367 --> 03:28:39.244
-TRAVIS: That's what I'm saying!
-LIAM: That will turn

03:28:39.244 --> 03:28:41.234
your blonde hair green!

03:28:41.267 --> 03:28:43.133
TALIESIN: No!

03:28:43.167 --> 03:28:44.274
MATT: Ah.

03:28:45.667 --> 03:28:46.834
"Not my favorite flavor."

03:28:46.868 --> 03:28:48.133
(gasping)

03:28:48.167 --> 03:28:50.024
-LIAM: She's got magic.
-SAM: She's so strong!

03:28:50.024 --> 03:28:52.067
LAURA: Constitutions for days!

03:28:52.067 --> 03:28:53.367
LIAM: She's so cool.

03:28:53.400 --> 03:28:55.901
TRAVIS: Will you teach me
your sorcerous ways?

03:28:55.934 --> 03:28:57.834
LAURA: Keep talking, keep talking.

03:28:57.868 --> 03:28:59.234
TRAVIS: How do you feel?

03:28:59.267 --> 03:29:01.300
MATT: "I feel fine."

03:29:01.334 --> 03:29:03.267
TRAVIS: I don't--I don't
know what to say.

03:29:03.300 --> 03:29:05.934
-LIAM: Fucking magic.
-SAM: She's amazing.

03:29:05.968 --> 03:29:07.634
MARISHA: You're awesome.

03:29:07.667 --> 03:29:10.601
LIAM: Can you say red leather,
yellow leather?

03:29:14.434 --> 03:29:15.901
What about--

03:29:15.934 --> 03:29:17.133
(laughing)

03:29:17.167 --> 03:29:19.667
What about--try saying
three times in a row

03:29:19.701 --> 03:29:22.100
can you say Irish wristwatch?

03:29:22.133 --> 03:29:24.033
(laughing)

03:29:27.267 --> 03:29:30.834
PATRICK: Three times in a row.

03:29:30.868 --> 03:29:35.834
LIAM: This is to Ker or Patrick--
Irish wristwatch

03:29:35.868 --> 03:29:37.968
as fast as you can
three times in a row.

03:29:38.000 --> 03:29:39.634
I have faith in you.

03:29:43.300 --> 03:29:45.000
PATRICK: Irish wr--

03:29:45.033 --> 03:29:48.534
(laughing)

03:29:48.567 --> 03:29:50.934
Irish wr--

03:29:59.234 --> 03:30:02.200
Irish wish--

03:30:02.234 --> 03:30:04.367
LIAM: You know, thank you for playing.

03:30:06.267 --> 03:30:08.133
That was a valiant effort.

03:30:10.634 --> 03:30:12.567
Hey, let's scry on a dragon!

03:30:14.667 --> 03:30:15.801
MATT: "All right."

03:30:15.834 --> 03:30:17.834
(laughing)

03:30:20.501 --> 03:30:21.701
TRAVIS: Were you in a motorcycle gang?

03:30:21.734 --> 03:30:25.033
How did she do that?

03:30:25.067 --> 03:30:27.801
-LIAM: Warrior!
-SAM: She's immune to alcohol.

03:30:27.834 --> 03:30:29.767
MATT: She sits across the table
from you and puts her hands out.

03:30:29.801 --> 03:30:31.667
SAM: Oh, yeah, let's do this.

03:30:31.701 --> 03:30:34.200
MARISHA: Oh, man, it just feels
like old days, Allura!

03:30:34.234 --> 03:30:36.167
MATT: "That it does--simpler times."

03:30:36.200 --> 03:30:37.868
MARISHA: Yes, it was.

03:30:37.901 --> 03:30:39.400
MATT: As you both close your eyes

03:30:39.434 --> 03:30:44.167
and you all watch as Allura
and Keyleth close their eyes.

03:30:45.267 --> 03:30:48.601
A moment passes,
a second moment,

03:30:48.634 --> 03:30:52.501
and across the smooth,
polished wood table surface

03:30:52.534 --> 03:30:53.834
of which you've been
having breakfast,

03:30:53.868 --> 03:30:57.100
you watch as the grain
begins to shift.

03:30:57.133 --> 03:31:01.868
Almost these small lines
of light blue and white

03:31:01.901 --> 03:31:04.734
sparkling, tiny arcane ley lines

03:31:04.767 --> 03:31:07.300
begin to just curl
a circle around the table.

03:31:07.334 --> 03:31:11.000
In the center,
their arms are clenched.

03:31:11.033 --> 03:31:13.267
You watch as it
carves two circles--

03:31:13.300 --> 03:31:14.868
one smaller one
within the other--

03:31:14.901 --> 03:31:17.300
and then begin to form
these various, rigid,

03:31:17.334 --> 03:31:21.000
star-like patterns within,
and as soon as the two points

03:31:21.033 --> 03:31:22.701
eventually connect
in the center,

03:31:22.734 --> 03:31:24.901
there's a flash,
and both Keyleth and Allura

03:31:24.934 --> 03:31:27.267
open their eyes,
but there is no pupil,

03:31:27.300 --> 03:31:29.267
there is no iris,
it is just white.

03:31:29.300 --> 03:31:31.434
-TRAVIS: Creepy.
-PATRICK: Fuck.

03:31:31.467 --> 03:31:35.200
(laughing)

03:31:35.234 --> 03:31:38.868
TALIESIN: That was the most Brian Blessed
fuck I've ever...

03:31:38.901 --> 03:31:39.968
It was amazing.

03:31:40.000 --> 03:31:42.033
(laughter continues)

03:31:45.167 --> 03:31:46.567
MATT: The two of you share a vision--

03:31:46.601 --> 03:31:49.901
a vision of water,
a vision of endless ocean--

03:31:49.934 --> 03:31:51.434
a familiar vision
of endless ocean.

03:31:51.467 --> 03:31:54.934
You see small pillars of steam

03:31:54.968 --> 03:31:57.501
rising out of the center
of this expanse,

03:31:57.534 --> 03:31:58.901
clusters of them in places,

03:31:58.934 --> 03:32:01.167
occasionally a few rocks
breaking the surface,

03:32:01.200 --> 03:32:03.367
and beyond that,
you see an island

03:32:03.400 --> 03:32:07.067
isolated out in the ocean,
covered with green.

03:32:07.100 --> 03:32:10.234
You see a large mountain
set across one side

03:32:10.267 --> 03:32:13.734
as your vision flashes inward
to an overhead view,

03:32:13.767 --> 03:32:15.567
you see a familiar island.

03:32:16.968 --> 03:32:19.067
SAM: ♪ And the line where
the sea meets the sky ♪

03:32:19.100 --> 03:32:21.133
♪ It's blinding ♪♪

03:32:21.167 --> 03:32:24.067
(laughing)

03:32:24.100 --> 03:32:26.000
MATT: The vision fades,
you both return,

03:32:26.033 --> 03:32:28.767
the circular glyphs
on the table

03:32:28.801 --> 03:32:30.067
kind of sparkle out

03:32:30.100 --> 03:32:32.467
leaving the smooth surface
untouched.

03:32:32.501 --> 03:32:34.234
Both of their eyes clarify,

03:32:34.267 --> 03:32:36.901
their irises
and pupils returning,

03:32:36.934 --> 03:32:39.234
and they both take
a simultaneous breath,

03:32:39.267 --> 03:32:41.334
and then release
each other's hands.

03:32:43.367 --> 03:32:45.634
MARISHA: Holy shit.

03:32:45.667 --> 03:32:47.167
-LAURA: So yeah?
-MARISHA: Yeah.

03:32:47.200 --> 03:32:48.234
We know where she is.

03:32:48.267 --> 03:32:50.067
(gasping)

03:32:50.100 --> 03:32:51.267
It's the island.

03:32:51.300 --> 03:32:52.868
LAURA: Do we know how to get
to the island?

03:32:52.901 --> 03:32:54.767
MARISHA: I can tree stride us there.

03:32:54.801 --> 03:32:56.334
I saw a tree--did I see
a tree big enough?

03:32:56.367 --> 03:32:57.734
-MATT: There were a number of trees.
-LAURA: Oh, geez!

03:32:57.767 --> 03:32:59.033
SAM: Palm trees?

03:32:59.067 --> 03:33:01.667
LAURA: Oh, my God, we need
to rest and get there.

03:33:01.701 --> 03:33:04.100
-MARISHA: We need to rest and get there.
-LIAM: We need to go the fuck to bed.

03:33:04.133 --> 03:33:05.367
PATRICK: Let's go right now!

03:33:05.400 --> 03:33:07.501
(cross talk)

03:33:10.367 --> 03:33:12.100
That was a joke.

03:33:12.133 --> 03:33:15.501
(laughing)

03:33:15.534 --> 03:33:16.701
LAURA: Shit, we need to rest!

03:33:16.734 --> 03:33:18.100
MARISHA: Oh, my God, yeah.

03:33:18.133 --> 03:33:20.734
-LAURA: And go!
-MARISHA: We need to rest and go.

03:33:20.767 --> 03:33:22.234
LIAM: We should go right away.

03:33:22.267 --> 03:33:25.400
What a to-do to die today
at a minute or two 'til two.

03:33:25.434 --> 03:33:27.267
SAM: Trippingly off the tongue.

03:33:28.834 --> 03:33:31.100
-MATT: "You get two options."
-LAURA: Okay.

03:33:31.133 --> 03:33:34.267
MATT: "And I defer to
your judgment on this.

03:33:34.300 --> 03:33:35.934
You rest and prepare,

03:33:35.968 --> 03:33:38.033
that leaves her
to rest and prepare."

03:33:38.067 --> 03:33:40.167
-LAURA: Yes.
-MATT: "You don't rest,

03:33:40.200 --> 03:33:42.067
she doesn't rest.

03:33:42.100 --> 03:33:44.017
The choice is yours
as to which you think

03:33:44.017 --> 03:33:46.634
leaves you in the more
advantageous position.

03:33:46.667 --> 03:33:50.167
MARISHA: I--I--I cannot...

03:33:50.200 --> 03:33:52.167
get us there.

03:33:52.200 --> 03:33:54.467
-LAURA: We need to rest.
-LIAM: Can you get us there?

03:33:54.501 --> 03:33:57.033
MATT: "I've unfortunately
already used my spell

03:33:57.067 --> 03:34:00.100
to get you to..."

03:34:00.133 --> 03:34:02.167
LIAM: But you're say--I understand
what you're saying.

03:34:02.200 --> 03:34:03.868
-She's got nothing--
-MATT: She stops and goes,

03:34:03.901 --> 03:34:06.567
"I've seen it, actually,
with the vision.

03:34:06.601 --> 03:34:10.100
And I did rest--I do--I could.

03:34:10.133 --> 03:34:12.467
I could get you there."

03:34:12.501 --> 03:34:14.501
SAM: To what end?

03:34:14.534 --> 03:34:16.901
-MATT: "The choice is yours."
-SAM: I have nothing.

03:34:16.934 --> 03:34:20.467
LIAM: But Scanlan, pluses and minuses.

03:34:20.501 --> 03:34:23.000
She has nothing.

03:34:23.033 --> 03:34:27.167
SAM: I can't die, Vax.

03:34:27.200 --> 03:34:28.701
I've already died once today,

03:34:28.734 --> 03:34:29.934
I can't do it again.

03:34:29.968 --> 03:34:31.234
LAURA: We don't have any healing.

03:34:31.267 --> 03:34:34.868
If anybody dies,
we can't come back.

03:34:34.901 --> 03:34:36.701
TRAVIS: I've got two healing potions.

03:34:36.734 --> 03:34:40.100
MARISHA: Okay, all right.

03:34:40.133 --> 03:34:41.934
(humming)

03:34:41.968 --> 03:34:45.534
Is there a way, do you know,
where we can maybe, like,

03:34:45.567 --> 03:34:48.234
restore ourselves faster?

03:34:50.534 --> 03:34:53.033
(laughing)

03:34:53.067 --> 03:34:55.367
MATT: "I wouldn't recommend that."

03:34:55.400 --> 03:34:57.133
TRAVIS: Oh?

03:34:57.167 --> 03:34:59.801
LAURA: Oh!

03:34:59.834 --> 03:35:01.501
MATT: "But nevertheleth..."

03:35:01.534 --> 03:35:02.934
(laughing)

03:35:02.968 --> 03:35:04.901
TRAVIS: Amazing.

03:35:04.934 --> 03:35:07.567
PATRICK: Say, Irish wr--wr--

03:35:07.601 --> 03:35:09.868
(laughing)

03:35:09.901 --> 03:35:11.334
TALIESIN: Hard, isn't it?

03:35:17.567 --> 03:35:19.673
MATT: She goes back to
braiding her hair.

03:35:19.673 --> 03:35:21.934
(laughing)

03:35:21.968 --> 03:35:24.834
MARISHA: What is the minimum amount
of time we could sleep?

03:35:24.868 --> 03:35:26.334
MATT: Eight hours.

03:35:26.367 --> 03:35:27.868
(grumbling)

03:35:27.901 --> 03:35:29.167
TRAVIS: Let's do it, let's sleep.

03:35:29.200 --> 03:35:31.701
LIAM: So if we rest,
she gets her meteors,

03:35:31.734 --> 03:35:33.000
she gets her everything.

03:35:33.033 --> 03:35:34.901
-LAURA: She gets it all back.
-SAM: And she could leave.

03:35:37.234 --> 03:35:40.067
LIAM: She's gonna rest, too,
to get all her shit back.

03:35:40.100 --> 03:35:44.167
If we go now,
having had a breather

03:35:44.200 --> 03:35:46.033
with this drunk guy...

03:35:47.567 --> 03:35:50.300
-LAURA: No!
-LIAM: I'm not saying what we do.

03:35:50.334 --> 03:35:52.400
You can decide what we do
because you're the smart one,

03:35:52.434 --> 03:35:53.734
but I'm just talking it out.

03:35:53.767 --> 03:35:55.434
She--it would be
a physical fight

03:35:55.467 --> 03:35:57.634
with none of her magic.

03:35:57.667 --> 03:36:00.467
TALIESIN: If we had--if we had
a dragon with us, I'd say yes.

03:36:00.501 --> 03:36:03.014
LIAM: You two brainiacs
can make the decision,

03:36:03.014 --> 03:36:06.133
but she's got no meteors,
she's got a lot less.

03:36:06.167 --> 03:36:08.267
LAURA: Look, we took on Thordak
with full health,

03:36:08.300 --> 03:36:11.267
and we made it out pretty well.

03:36:11.300 --> 03:36:13.167
MARISHA: I mean, once again,
unless we do this--

03:36:13.200 --> 03:36:16.267
unless we get to the island,

03:36:16.300 --> 03:36:20.133
try and scout out--
find Raishan...

03:36:20.167 --> 03:36:24.767
...island,
that way if she moves...

03:36:24.801 --> 03:36:26.667
we won't let her leave?

03:36:27.834 --> 03:36:29.701
What Grog, what?

03:36:29.734 --> 03:36:33.067
SAM: I can't camp on the island,
I don't have the mansion.

03:36:33.100 --> 03:36:36.934
MARISHA: We can camp like we did
old school style.

03:36:36.968 --> 03:36:38.467
TALIESIN: She would know
that we were there--

03:36:38.501 --> 03:36:41.801
LAURA: Wait a minute,
you said you had it left.

03:36:41.834 --> 03:36:44.200
TALIESIN: And if we go there...

03:36:44.234 --> 03:36:45.834
LAURA: Scanlan, you said you
still had the spell left

03:36:45.868 --> 03:36:47.701
-so we could--
-MARISHA: No, he used it

03:36:47.734 --> 03:36:51.534
to change Jarrett's mind, right?

03:36:51.567 --> 03:36:52.868
MATT: Well, you don't know that.

03:36:52.901 --> 03:36:55.133
MARISHA: Well.

03:36:55.167 --> 03:36:57.634
LAURA: Oh, well, shit.

03:36:57.667 --> 03:36:59.868
SAM: I used it in the battle,
fuck off.

03:36:59.901 --> 03:37:01.968
(laughing)

03:37:04.434 --> 03:37:05.968
TALIESIN: If--if we were to go right now,

03:37:06.000 --> 03:37:07.467
I would almost recommend

03:37:07.501 --> 03:37:09.868
that Scanlan
and Keyleth stay behind

03:37:09.901 --> 03:37:12.300
because they would be
nothing but targets.

03:37:13.667 --> 03:37:15.467
TRAVIS: Ooh, how does that feel?

03:37:15.501 --> 03:37:16.834
LIAM: Well, then, we won't do that.

03:37:16.868 --> 03:37:18.067
TALIESIN: Which is why we shouldn't go,

03:37:18.100 --> 03:37:21.334
because if we go, it is...
the four of us.

03:37:21.367 --> 03:37:24.367
TRAVIS: Strangely, I agree with Percy.

03:37:24.400 --> 03:37:27.100
TALIESIN: And if we wait a day?

03:37:29.267 --> 03:37:31.667
It's six--it's at least
six, seven, eight of us--

03:37:31.701 --> 03:37:32.834
however many was can bring,

03:37:32.868 --> 03:37:35.234
but every magic user
right now is--

03:37:35.267 --> 03:37:37.434
-LAURA: Tapped.
-LIAM: Allura.

03:37:37.467 --> 03:37:38.667
-MATT: "Yes."
-LAURA: Except for her.

03:37:38.701 --> 03:37:41.734
LIAM: I kinda wanted to bring you
in the beginning.

03:37:41.767 --> 03:37:44.434
Are you willing to come with us?

03:37:44.467 --> 03:37:47.634
MATT: "There's no need for me
to maintain the illutho--

03:37:47.667 --> 03:37:50.950
-the illusory barrier on the thity."

03:37:50.950 --> 03:37:52.470
-PATRICK: Wristwatch.

03:37:52.470 --> 03:37:54.767
(laughing)

03:37:54.801 --> 03:37:57.100
MARISHA: You did it!

03:37:57.133 --> 03:37:58.701
MATT: "That's rather imprethive."

03:38:01.200 --> 03:38:04.534
MARISHA: Okay, well, look,
if we wanted to go now,

03:38:04.567 --> 03:38:08.234
I still have my beast shaping back.

03:38:08.267 --> 03:38:10.934
TALIESIN: That's a bit...

03:38:10.968 --> 03:38:14.334
MARISHA: I have one first-level spell,
two third-level spells,

03:38:14.367 --> 03:38:17.767
and one fourth-level spell.

03:38:17.801 --> 03:38:19.100
-LAURA: Oh, my God.
-SAM: That's enough to kill a dragon.

03:38:19.133 --> 03:38:23.267
LIAM: Do we have--here's a question.

03:38:23.300 --> 03:38:25.801
Do we have some
healing potions banked

03:38:25.834 --> 03:38:27.968
-at Whitestone right now?
-TRAVIS: No.

03:38:28.000 --> 03:38:29.534
-LAURA: We took them all.
-MATT: "To be perfectly honetht,

03:38:29.567 --> 03:38:31.300
we've given you
everything we have."

03:38:31.334 --> 03:38:32.868
(laughing)

03:38:32.901 --> 03:38:34.834
-LAURA: Are there any--
-MATT: "Don't laugh at me, Vex'thahlia."

03:38:34.868 --> 03:38:37.033
LAURA: I'm not, darling, I'm not.

03:38:37.067 --> 03:38:39.133
MARISHA: I haven't used any of my health.

03:38:39.167 --> 03:38:42.534
LAURA: Are there any steal-- heal--(stammering)

03:38:42.567 --> 03:38:45.100
LAURA: Are there any healers
within the castle?

03:38:45.133 --> 03:38:48.367
PATRICK: I am relatively fresh
in terms of healing.

03:38:48.400 --> 03:38:50.601
I could heal some.

03:38:50.634 --> 03:38:52.133
-LAURA: Would you wanna go with us?
-LIAM: Yes, but are you

03:38:52.167 --> 03:38:54.200
in Burbank next week, though?

03:38:54.234 --> 03:38:56.300
(laughing)

03:38:56.334 --> 03:38:58.290
SAM: Pike is out!

03:38:58.290 --> 03:39:00.400
LAURA: Pike is done.

03:39:00.400 --> 03:39:03.100
She's got two 
first-level spells left.

03:39:03.133 --> 03:39:04.234
That's it.

03:39:04.267 --> 03:39:06.901
SAM: I have one fifth and one fourth.

03:39:06.934 --> 03:39:08.200
No, two fourths.

03:39:08.234 --> 03:39:09.901
LAURA: I think I've got two
first-levels spells left,

03:39:09.934 --> 03:39:12.234
-but that's it.
-TALIESIN: It's--

03:39:12.267 --> 03:39:13.767
TRAVIS: Let's be honest.

03:39:13.801 --> 03:39:15.868
We're not quite at our best,

03:39:15.901 --> 03:39:19.968
and it's one diseased
deceiver in a cave

03:39:20.000 --> 03:39:21.834
with another
dead dragon that might

03:39:21.868 --> 03:39:25.667
or might not come back to life,
and two baby little eggs.

03:39:25.701 --> 03:39:29.501
We rest, and then
we give 'em hell!

03:39:29.534 --> 03:39:33.801
PATRICK: The brass dragon, I feel,
made a great point

03:39:33.834 --> 03:39:39.367
that if you let
someone of that...

03:39:39.400 --> 03:39:43.801
-SAM: Power.
-PATRICK: ...power choose

03:39:43.834 --> 03:39:46.167
the rules of engagement...

03:39:48.801 --> 03:39:50.334
-LAURA: Right.
-LIAM: That's a good point,

03:39:50.367 --> 03:39:52.634
and Allura makes a good point.

03:39:54.234 --> 03:39:56.968
TRAVIS: Plus she doesn't know
that we know where she is.

03:39:57.000 --> 03:40:00.167
She thinks she's got
all the time in the world.

03:40:00.200 --> 03:40:01.467
SAM: You wanna go now?

03:40:01.501 --> 03:40:03.267
TRAVIS: No, I wanna wait.

03:40:03.300 --> 03:40:04.834
TALIESIN: Go tomorrow.

03:40:04.868 --> 03:40:07.601
LAURA: I think we rest
and we go tonight.

03:40:07.634 --> 03:40:09.868
We sleep eight hours,
it's only in the morning--

03:40:09.901 --> 03:40:11.901
we go as soon as we're rested.

03:40:11.934 --> 03:40:14.267
LIAM: She's gonna have
everything tomorrow.

03:40:14.267 --> 03:40:18.567
MARISHA: Can we, like, do,
like, six hours...

03:40:18.601 --> 03:40:19.834
SAM: She won't be
expecting us at all.

03:40:19.868 --> 03:40:21.667
MARISHA: ...and chug some coffee?

03:40:21.701 --> 03:40:23.434
MATT: Nope, need a full
eight hour rest.

03:40:23.467 --> 03:40:25.133
SAM: She won't be
expecting us at all.

03:40:25.167 --> 03:40:26.868
We'll still have
the element of surprise,

03:40:26.901 --> 03:40:29.801
she won't have a lair to defend.

03:40:29.834 --> 03:40:32.834
She won't have any other
fire giants to protect her.

03:40:32.868 --> 03:40:34.367
TALIESIN: There might be a lair.

03:40:34.400 --> 03:40:38.868
TRAVIS: Maybe, but we are fucking tits
against lairs, come on.

03:40:38.901 --> 03:40:40.734
SAM: You have a dancing
fucking sword.

03:40:40.767 --> 03:40:42.234
LAURA: That's right.

03:40:42.267 --> 03:40:43.534
LIAM: Percy, what do you think?

03:40:43.567 --> 03:40:48.667
TALIESIN: I think we--honestly,
I think that we--

03:40:48.701 --> 03:40:50.434
I think if we go
right now, we win,

03:40:50.467 --> 03:40:52.400
and at least one of us dies.

03:40:52.434 --> 03:40:55.634
And if we go tomorrow,
we're probably going to win,

03:40:55.667 --> 03:40:58.834
and probably most of us
are going to survive.

03:40:58.868 --> 03:41:04.567
PATRICK: Unless she is merely
scrounging there.

03:41:04.601 --> 03:41:06.167
TALIESIN: I think she might be scrounging,

03:41:06.200 --> 03:41:08.667
but I think if she's scrounging,
that's a lot to look through.

03:41:08.701 --> 03:41:10.567
I think that
she thinks she's safe.

03:41:10.601 --> 03:41:13.734
LAURA: Did it look like there was
a lot of books there, Keyleth?

03:41:13.767 --> 03:41:15.100
MATT: There were quite a number.

03:41:15.133 --> 03:41:17.234
Probably 100 at the very least.

03:41:17.267 --> 03:41:19.067
SAM: We don't even know what she is.

03:41:19.100 --> 03:41:21.968
-Didn't you see a woman?
-LIAM: But that was her.

03:41:22.000 --> 03:41:23.734
MARISHA: That's Raishan
in her female form.

03:41:23.767 --> 03:41:26.634
LIAM: So she can look at books so
she doesn't fucking mangle them.

03:41:26.667 --> 03:41:28.934
TRAVIS: Keyleth, are you worried
if we wait,

03:41:28.968 --> 03:41:31.901
you're going to lose
the chance to kill Raishan?

03:41:33.968 --> 03:41:36.977
MARISHA: I don't think we're gonna lose
the chance to kill Raishan,

03:41:36.977 --> 03:41:40.601
it's just a matter
of who's killing who first.

03:41:40.634 --> 03:41:42.567
TALIESIN: I say that we take
eight hours' sleep,

03:41:42.601 --> 03:41:44.968
and we go there immediately.

03:41:46.467 --> 03:41:48.567
TRAVIS: She thinks she's got cover,
but she doesn't.

03:41:48.601 --> 03:41:51.033
TALIESIN: It will have
only been ten hours at best

03:41:51.067 --> 03:41:52.267
by the time we get there.

03:41:52.300 --> 03:41:54.467
MARISHA: Allura, since you know
of the island,

03:41:54.501 --> 03:41:56.234
and we know where she is,
is there any way

03:41:56.267 --> 03:41:58.100
where we can keep an eye
on the island

03:41:58.133 --> 03:42:00.701
magically from afar?

03:42:00.734 --> 03:42:04.267
If Raishan moves, we know?

03:42:04.300 --> 03:42:11.534
MATT: "I mean, I can incrementally
scry on an island

03:42:11.567 --> 03:42:14.167
and keep an eye on the vicinity,

03:42:14.200 --> 03:42:18.300
but if I scry
directly on Raishan--"

03:42:18.334 --> 03:42:19.767
-MARISHA: She could sense it.
-TALIESIN: She'll sense it.

03:42:19.801 --> 03:42:21.601
MATT: "Well, there's a chance."

03:42:21.634 --> 03:42:23.534
MARISHA: Yeah, let's not do that.

03:42:25.067 --> 03:42:27.100
TRAVIS: Don't you wanna be at your best?

03:42:27.133 --> 03:42:31.167
Don't you wanna be some fucking
wicked badass from the sky?

03:42:31.200 --> 03:42:33.100
Or do you wanna limp in?

03:42:33.133 --> 03:42:34.901
-LAURA: Right?
-TRAVIS: Yeah.

03:42:34.934 --> 03:42:37.067
LAURA: Plus, if she's got
100 books to go through,

03:42:37.100 --> 03:42:38.601
that's gonna take
more than two hours.

03:42:38.634 --> 03:42:41.434
TALIESIN: She may not--it's possible
she may not even rest.

03:42:41.467 --> 03:42:42.968
She might just be
so angry that she's--

03:42:43.000 --> 03:42:44.901
LAURA: She might not be fully rested
by the time we get there.

03:42:44.934 --> 03:42:47.033
TRAVIS: I know it feels like
an advantage to press,

03:42:47.067 --> 03:42:49.834
but we were five down
at one point.

03:42:49.868 --> 03:42:51.701
LAURA: I can't die again.

03:42:51.734 --> 03:42:54.501
TRAVIS: You can, but it's not advisable.

03:42:56.434 --> 03:42:57.767
TALIESIN: Let's not let that happen.

03:42:57.801 --> 03:43:00.634
MARISHA: She has none of her legendary
resistances right now.

03:43:00.667 --> 03:43:02.601
TRAVIS: No, I'm not worried about those.

03:43:02.634 --> 03:43:06.300
TALIESIN: She--we may
interrupt her mid-slumber.

03:43:06.334 --> 03:43:10.300
MARISHA: How long did it take when, um,

03:43:10.334 --> 03:43:15.467
we injured...was that Vorugal?

03:43:15.501 --> 03:43:17.868
Who retreated
and started healing?

03:43:17.901 --> 03:43:21.334
-LIAM: Umbrasyl.
-MARISHA: Umbrasyl.

03:43:21.367 --> 03:43:24.100
-TRAVIS: In his lair.
-MARISHA: In his lair.

MATT: All right, so as you all
find evening's rest,

03:53:45.367 --> 03:53:47.467

PATRICK: Honestly, I was already

03:54:12.868 --> 03:54:14.901
trying to figure
that out in my head.

03:54:14.934 --> 03:54:18.067
Like, it's--I mean,
I've flown places

You know, so I'll maybe
email with you a little bit

03:54:26.767 --> 03:54:27.901

LAURA: You had a pretty
awesome hammer there!

03:54:35.234 --> 03:54:37.767
PATRICK: I, uh--I have yet
to actually take him

03:54:37.801 --> 03:54:40.067
for a test drive
in that way, so...
