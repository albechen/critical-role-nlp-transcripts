00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.450
MATT: Welcome, everybody, to Critical Role! Our
Thursday night show where a bunch of us nerdy-ass

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:08.724
voice actors play Dungeons and Dragons and roll
dice and all that fun stuff in between! So for all

00:00:08.724 --> 00:00:13.723
you new folks, welcome to our chaos. For all you
old folks, thanks and welcome back. We have a

00:00:13.723 --> 00:00:16.693
number of announcements to get through. I'll try
and cruise through them as fast as humanly

00:00:16.693 --> 00:00:23.055
possible. Pardon my phone as a reminder. Google
docs are a delightful thing. Starting off, I

00:00:23.055 --> 00:00:30.759
wanted to direct all you Critters to our official
Twitter, @CriticalRole, for official news and

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:35.833
announcements. You're welcome to still tweet at us
for individual cast fun but we do have our

00:00:35.833 --> 00:00:41.186
official source for all official announcements,
times, and our appearances. That would be the one

00:00:41.186 --> 00:00:45.452
to pay attention to. Go to @CriticalRole, follow
it and any important stuff that comes in the

00:00:45.452 --> 00:00:52.071
future will be available via that Twitter.
Awesome. Next up this weekend we're all going to

00:00:52.071 --> 00:01:00.317
be at New York Comic Con, which is going to be
awesome. We have a two hour block from noon to

00:01:00.317 --> 00:01:04.453
2:00 PM Saturday, October 12th. Where is it at?
What's the room?

00:01:04.453 --> 00:01:13.730
LIAM: It's a weird word, the Winga Stage?

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:25.179
MATT: It's not on the Google Doc. Curse you,
Google doc! But Saturday from noon to 2:00 PM, and

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:29.234
then on Sunday, for those who can't make the
actual convention, we're having an off-site

00:01:29.234 --> 00:01:35.134
gathering of Critters at the wonderful and
illustrious comic book store Forbidden Planet.

00:01:35.134 --> 00:01:41.781
That will be from 2:30 to 4:30. Our time block
shifted a little later in the day. 2:30 to 4:30,

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:46.468
Forbidden Planet, we'll be there. We'll be signing
autographs, meeting you guys, chatting it up, and

00:01:46.468 --> 00:01:54.802
we'll be debuting our brand new awesome poster
here, exclusively for the New York Comic Con. Our

00:01:54.802 --> 00:02:01.230
Critical Role poster! We're super excited about
it. This was wonderfully designed by one of our

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:14.387
fellow Critters Joma Cueto. Joma did the art and
Kim Davis did the actual layout and design. Both

00:02:14.387 --> 00:02:17.965
did an amazing job. We're going to have a bunch of
these available. We'll be signing them for you

00:02:17.965 --> 00:02:20.263
guys, and we'll hope to see you there.

00:02:20.263 --> 00:02:21.685
LIAM: I love it.

00:02:21.685 --> 00:02:25.631
TRAVIS: They are pretty sexy.

00:02:25.631 --> 00:02:31.326
LIAM: We're going to be on the Wikia stage.

00:02:31.326 --> 00:02:37.968
MATT: The Wikia stage on Saturday, near hall 1A,
the Wikia stage at noon to 2:00 PM. Come find us

00:02:37.968 --> 00:02:50.914
on Saturday, we're going to be there. Also, a ton
of mail was recently received just after Critmas.

00:02:50.914 --> 00:02:59.811
If your gifts weren't seen this last Critmas,
they're probably in this batch. So next Critmas is

00:02:59.811 --> 00:03:05.289
probably going to be a long haul. It's going to be
a doozy! But we're excited about that. That'll be

00:03:05.289 --> 00:03:12.766
the first Thursday of November, so look forward to
that happening then. Next update. If you haven't

00:03:12.766 --> 00:03:16.906
been paying attention, we've been having
occasional interviews once a week of our cast

00:03:16.906 --> 00:03:20.982
going up on Geek and Sundry's website. Today we
had Travis's go up and if you haven't checked them

00:03:20.982 --> 00:03:26.519
out you should. It's a little step into our
mindset, our crazy history and background of how

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:31.918
this whole thing got started. Silly things ensue.
So go read them if you have the chance, if you

00:03:31.918 --> 00:03:38.167
haven't yet. Or wait until after the show. Also,
as of today we now have in the Geek and Sundry

00:03:38.167 --> 00:03:41.060
store Critical Role key chains and necklaces.

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:44.921
LAURA: They look so cool.

00:03:44.921 --> 00:03:51.523
MATT: Pretty rad. I'm really excited. They're
metal and awesome. They're of our logo and if you

00:03:51.523 --> 00:03:56.814
feel like being as nerdy as we are and want to
adorn your key chains with them, they are there

00:03:56.814 --> 00:03:58.523
available for your purchase.

00:03:58.523 --> 00:04:04.311
LAURA: They're custom order, so they make them
when you order them. It takes a few weeks to get

00:04:04.311 --> 00:04:06.292
them once you order them, but it's worth it.

00:04:06.292 --> 00:04:11.327
LIAM: They have to come all the way from
Kraghammer.

00:04:11.327 --> 00:04:18.525
MATT: Mithril's hard to sculpt properly. Takes a
while. Couple of other things, LARP: the Series,

00:04:18.525 --> 00:04:23.779
one of the live action series here in Geek and
Sundry. Season two just premiered today. It's a

00:04:23.779 --> 00:04:29.627
really cool series that both has moments of drama
and comedy that plays into the whole world and

00:04:29.627 --> 00:04:35.537
lifestyle of the LARPing game systems and the people.
It's a really cool series. Check it out if that's

00:04:35.537 --> 00:04:45.303
your kind of bag. It's good stuff, really funny.
Next Monday starts a new show called TPK Monday

00:04:45.303 --> 00:04:52.216
Nights, where our illustrious Ivan, who hosts many
wonderful things here, will be running for the

00:04:52.216 --> 00:04:58.860
rest of October a group of other individuals
through the RPG Outbreak Undead, which is actually

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:06.567
a really cool RPG that Ivan actually designed and was
in the whole process for, so it's Monday nights,

00:05:06.567 --> 00:05:10.762
check that out the rest of October! To keep the
Halloween theme, we will probably be getting dead

00:05:10.762 --> 00:05:14.395
repeatedly at the hands of Ivan, so look forward
to that.

00:05:14.395 --> 00:05:22.450
This is the last week you can buy the
#NoShaveTil10k shirts. We have people who are

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:26.892
keeping it up. I had to shave for Vin Diesel, but
the rest of the month is straight on this now,

00:05:26.892 --> 00:05:33.112
largely for my Halloween costume and for this
wonderful event. 20% of all proceeds from those

00:05:33.112 --> 00:05:37.855
shirts goes to the Extra Life charity we've been
supporting, it helps out good people.

00:05:37.855 --> 00:05:43.718
ZAC: I drew that shirt, by the way. I had to look
at his face for 12 hours.

00:05:43.718 --> 00:05:45.772
TRAVIS: You're welcome.

00:05:45.772 --> 00:05:51.110
ZAC: We've already hit 9,100. Protocol95, you are
the first winner of the night!

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:56.718
MATT: Protocol95, congratulations. You will be
winning the first bundle. Every 100 subscribers

00:05:56.718 --> 00:06:02.868
there will be another giveaway within the chat
room. You have to be active in the chat to be up

00:06:02.868 --> 00:06:09.325
for it. It includes a cast photo signed by the
cast of Critical Role, possibly signed while he's

00:06:09.325 --> 00:06:16.219
wearing that awesome beard. And a wonderful piece
of art from our main artist Kit Buss, also signed

00:06:16.219 --> 00:06:19.696
by the cast of Critical Role. So every 100
subscribers, that giveaway goes out in the

00:06:19.696 --> 00:06:26.418
chatroom. Be active and bring your friends on to
subscribe so you can win one. Last thing I want to

00:06:26.418 --> 00:06:29.860
mention, this has been a question that's come up
quite a bit, some people are definitely eager to

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:36.122
hear the information, so I had the pleasure on
Monday this week of designing and running a very

00:06:36.122 --> 00:06:39.050
quick game of Dungeons and Dragons for Vin
Diesel.

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:41.509
LIAM: What? (laughs)

00:06:41.509 --> 00:06:46.421
MATT: Let's just cross that bucket list item off
immediately. That was ridiculous. So it was a lot

00:06:46.421 --> 00:06:50.802
of fun. He was fantastic, super awesome, genuine,
and was really excited--

00:06:50.802 --> 00:06:54.236
LAURA: He rolled this die. It's sacred.

00:06:54.236 --> 00:06:57.782
TALIESIN: It was literally bucket list! That was
one of the things we discussed when this game started;

00:06:57.782 --> 00:07:00.781
it could lead to a game with Vin Diesel.

00:07:00.781 --> 00:07:06.052
MARISHA: I bet if you go back and look at the Q
and A session we had, someone asked our dream game

00:07:06.052 --> 00:07:07.294
crew--

00:07:07.294 --> 00:07:11.647
MATT: Vin Diesel was one of our bucket list
players. So we've already knocked one off on the

00:07:11.647 --> 00:07:12.896
show.

00:07:12.896 --> 00:07:15.496
TALIESIN: It's like a group mass suicide at this
point.

00:07:15.496 --> 00:07:17.729
MATT: Get matching tennis shoes, and it'll be
great.

00:07:17.729 --> 00:07:20.405
LIAM: You didn't seem that excited, though.

00:07:20.405 --> 00:07:24.644
ZAC: We can already announce that next Thursday at
the midpoint--

00:07:24.644 --> 00:07:31.219
MATT: Next Thursday at the midpoint of next week's
Critical Role, we are going to show a mostly

00:07:31.219 --> 00:07:37.834
complete video of that game. The full one will be
released shortly thereafter, but next week, on

00:07:37.834 --> 00:07:41.597
Critical Role during the midpoint, we're going to
show you the majority of that game session with

00:07:41.597 --> 00:07:43.719
him. Don't miss that.

00:07:43.719 --> 00:07:48.564
ORION: Can I get a teaser? What did he smell
like?

00:07:48.564 --> 00:07:52.585
LIAM: Iron.

00:07:52.585 --> 00:07:54.264
TRAVIS: Quarry.

00:07:54.264 --> 00:07:55.600
LAURA: Muscle.

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:59.878
TALIESIN: Antifreeze and lilac.

00:07:59.878 --> 00:08:11.809
MATT: All of those answers at once. A majestic
scent. It was delightful. We'll have interviews

00:08:11.809 --> 00:08:16.935
going up throughout the week, exclusively next
week here on Thursday you'll be seeing most of

00:08:16.935 --> 00:08:21.352
that game here and then more stuff's coming out
for the week thereafter. Really excited about

00:08:21.352 --> 00:08:26.153
that, and I custom-made a witchhunter class for
him that I tailored for that level, and there's

00:08:26.153 --> 00:08:29.261
been such a wide response for everyone asking
about the class that I've now spent a lot of my

00:08:29.261 --> 00:08:34.562
free time that I'm not preparing for this game now
customizing a homebrew witchhunter class for all

00:08:34.562 --> 00:08:39.226
of you to partake in. So that'll be fun and
probably coming out sometime next week. It'll

00:08:39.226 --> 00:08:43.298
probably be broken. You're welcome to homebrew my
homebrew, I'm not perfect, but it should be fun

00:08:43.298 --> 00:08:48.473
and a cool guide for some people to give it a shot
as a player class, so look forward to that. Liam,

00:08:48.473 --> 00:08:50.138
you got a couple things to announce?

00:08:50.138 --> 00:08:54.822
LIAM: Yeah, just two things. I wanted to thank
every Critter who helped out with Joe Madureira's

00:08:54.822 --> 00:09:00.718
Kickstarter with Airship Syndicate's Kickstarter
for Battle Chasers: Nightwar. They crushed it.

00:09:00.718 --> 00:09:05.582
They got to almost every rung of their ladder.
Maybe you guys could help them raise 100k tonight.

00:09:05.582 --> 00:09:12.035
But Joe told me that they saw a little bit of a
bump every Thursday, and that our roleplaying

00:09:12.035 --> 00:09:15.224
power had some effect, so thank you guys, thank
you very much.

00:09:15.224 --> 00:09:18.010
TRAVIS: Because we are many.

00:09:18.010 --> 00:09:19.451
MATT: We are legion.

00:09:19.451 --> 00:09:23.196
LIAM: The other thing is tomorrow is Sam Riegel's
birthday.

00:09:23.196 --> 00:09:26.171
TRAVIS: Nipples, is it really?

00:09:26.171 --> 00:09:32.498
LIAM: I have a birthday present for him tonight.
Something I commissioned the lovely Kit Buss to

00:09:32.498 --> 00:09:33.606
make for you.

00:09:33.606 --> 00:09:35.327
SAM: What? It's Vaxmas?

00:09:35.327 --> 00:09:38.602
LIAM: It's Vaxmas. Here it is. I'm going to send
it across and then I'll tweet it out. You guys can

00:09:38.602 --> 00:09:40.598
look, but I made this just for you.

00:09:40.598 --> 00:09:42.135
SAM: I'm not looking.

00:09:42.135 --> 00:09:43.734
MARISHA: I made this just for you.

00:09:43.734 --> 00:09:54.093
SAM: Oh wow, that's really nice! I thought it was
going to be vulgar. Wow. That's so sweet.

00:09:54.093 --> 00:09:56.058
TRAVIS: Kit Buss, why are you the best?

00:09:56.058 --> 00:10:03.107
SAM: Thank you, Kit Buss. Me and two ladies, what
could be better? Right?

00:10:03.107 --> 00:10:05.589
TRAVIS: I guess three ladies.

00:10:05.589 --> 00:10:12.193
SAM: I don't know how to put this up, but thank
you. That's so sweet. Aw. I won't kill you

00:10:12.628 --> 00:10:14.190
tonight.

00:10:14.190 --> 00:10:19.712
ORION: Fun fact: Sam shares a birthday with my
mom. That's why I'll never forget your birthday,

00:10:19.712 --> 00:10:20.969
ever.

00:10:20.969 --> 00:10:22.557
SAM: And John Lennon.

00:10:22.557 --> 00:10:24.719
MARISHA: Happy birthday, Orion's mom.

00:10:24.719 --> 00:10:26.632
LAURA: Yeah. Happy birthday, Sam.

00:10:26.632 --> 00:10:31.013
MATT: Happy unbirthday to Sam's mom, who is also a
Critter. You should go follow her on Twitter.

00:10:31.013 --> 00:10:33.058
MARISHA: Momlan.

00:10:33.058 --> 00:10:35.061
LIAM: She's not effing around, either.

00:10:35.061 --> 00:10:44.265
MATT: Any other announcements? Or shall we dive
in?

00:10:44.265 --> 00:10:50.220
LAURA: I have one. I got nominated for a Golden
Joystick award.

00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:51.441
MATT: Really?

00:10:51.441 --> 00:10:53.516
LAURA: Yeah, for Fiona in Tales from the
Borderlands.

00:10:53.516 --> 00:10:54.652
MATT: That's awesome!

00:10:54.652 --> 00:10:56.532
(cheering)

00:10:56.532 --> 00:10:58.411
SAM: Hey Travis, you didn't know this?

00:10:58.411 --> 00:11:07.755
LAURA: I didn't tell him. I think there's a week
left of voting, so you can go and help out.

00:11:07.755 --> 00:11:10.139
ORION: They can vote for you?

00:11:10.139 --> 00:11:12.232
LAURA: Yes, they can vote for me.

00:11:12.232 --> 00:11:13.759
SAM: Can they vote many times?

00:11:13.759 --> 00:11:16.734
LAURA: I think you have to register your email
address, so I don't know how many times you can

00:11:16.734 --> 00:11:21.041
vote, but you have to vote in all the categories
in order to vote for the one category.

00:11:21.041 --> 00:11:25.979
TRAVIS: Congratulations, Laura.

00:11:25.979 --> 00:11:27.752
LAURA: Thanks, baby!

00:11:27.752 --> 00:11:30.138
MARISHA: As Orion says, release the Critters.

00:11:30.138 --> 00:11:38.567
MATT: That's awesome. Go show your support for
Fiona, and awesome! Let's go ahead and bring the

00:11:38.567 --> 00:11:43.417
mood back to our realm of imagination and fantasy
and be back here in just a minute with the

00:11:43.417 --> 00:11:47.003
beginning of this night's Critical Role.

00:11:47.003 --> 00:12:54.183
[dramatic music]

00:12:54.359 --> 00:13:01.519
MATT: So to get you guys caught up on what
happened recently, the group, having heard that

00:13:01.519 --> 00:13:08.764
the Briarwoods, a couple who had taken power in
the town of Whitestone far to the northeast,

00:13:08.764 --> 00:13:17.522
apparently responsible for the destruction of
Percy's entire family and his escape into the

00:13:17.522 --> 00:13:24.503
wilds of Tal'Dorei, were going to be coming to
Emon to bridge a political handshake with

00:13:24.503 --> 00:13:31.321
Sovereign Uriel and all of Tal'Dorei proper to
build a bridge across the channel that separates

00:13:31.321 --> 00:13:35.437
this continent from Wildemount across the sea.

00:13:35.437 --> 00:13:45.400
Upon hearing this, the party was planning to
gather information, and in doing so Vax got

00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:51.184
himself caught by sneaking into their bedroom and
was nearly killed in the process. The group

00:13:51.184 --> 00:13:58.552
managed to aid him, pull him out from the jaws of
death, and the Briarwoods escaped through arcane

00:13:58.552 --> 00:14:07.394
means, leaving a shattered carriage, a mostly
beaten driver of their carriage. Through the

00:14:07.394 --> 00:14:14.385
scuffle, a number of guards were hurt or killed,
and the party, upon meeting an individual named

00:14:14.385 --> 00:14:20.879
Lilith, a tiefling, leading her back to the Keep,
they were attacked, or seemingly attacked, by a

00:14:20.879 --> 00:14:28.074
series of bounty hunters that were after her.
There was some intense violence displayed against

00:14:28.074 --> 00:14:32.787
a few of them, and this all got back to the
Council. The Council called Vox Machina to the

00:14:32.787 --> 00:14:41.844
central palace and began a trial to see if they
were responsible for attacking guests of the

00:14:41.844 --> 00:14:50.368
Council, ruining what could've been a very
lucrative union between the two towns and possibly

00:14:50.368 --> 00:14:58.768
murdering an old woman. They had their membership
revoked, and during this sequence, apparently the

00:14:58.768 --> 00:15:05.362
charmed Seeker Asum was restored, seemingly to
little effect.

00:15:05.362 --> 00:15:11.746
The group then left, realizing that perhaps the
moral ramifications of their actions are having a

00:15:11.746 --> 00:15:16.986
bigger impact due to their visibility and their
heroic status in the kingdom at large. When they

00:15:16.986 --> 00:15:20.458
returned to the keep, they found two
representatives of the northern farmers of Emon

00:15:20.458 --> 00:15:26.041
that required aid; their livestock had been stolen
over the past few weeks and was putting them in

00:15:26.041 --> 00:15:31.702
dire straits when it came to the necessary amount
of meat they had to raise. The group, trying to

00:15:31.702 --> 00:15:37.460
turn their morality on its head, decided to aid,
waited out in the center of the cow pasture at

00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:48.091
night, masquerading, through illusionary magic, as
cows themselves. The giant roc, a gargantuan bird,

00:15:48.091 --> 00:15:56.097
swooped down and grabbed Cow-leth, Keyleth, here.
Swept her away. The rest of the party, Tiberius

00:15:56.097 --> 00:16:00.938
enabled to fly through arcane means, and thus we
had a squadron of evening cows chasing after the

00:16:00.938 --> 00:16:07.555
roc, which then got turned into a cow, to crash
into a mountain. They chased it back to its perch

00:16:07.555 --> 00:16:11.102
up in the Cliffside Mountains to the northwest of
Emon.

00:16:11.102 --> 00:16:12.898
LIAM: Such an old trope in fantasy.

00:16:12.898 --> 00:16:23.219
MATT: Isn't it, though? "Cow-mouflage." And
engaged a guardian of this roc, a gnome druid who

00:16:23.276 --> 00:16:29.642
had been removed from society for quite some time.
After some rather roundabout and at some points

00:16:29.642 --> 00:16:37.839
on-the-edge-of-conflict conversation, they managed
to convince him to instead take the bird and flee

00:16:37.839 --> 00:16:41.437
across the Ozmit Sea, to the northwest, towards
Vasselheim, where it would be a much better

00:16:41.437 --> 00:16:51.379
landscape for the creature to thrive and grow. After that,
the party is making their way back. Right around

00:16:51.379 --> 00:16:59.996
the beginning of daybreak, towards the keep. So
that is where we left off. Percy.

00:16:59.996 --> 00:17:05.955
TALIESIN: Yes? Hello.

00:17:05.955 --> 00:17:20.380
MATT: Darkness. Cold, lonely darkness. A flicker
of light. It swells, bright, white, blinding, then

00:17:20.380 --> 00:17:31.155
flashes of your family, screaming. Julius,
silenced by a bolt to the throat. Vesper, thrown

00:17:31.155 --> 00:17:36.230
from a tower wall. Your younger brothers' lifeless
bodies tossed in a pile. The smell of death

00:17:36.230 --> 00:17:43.102
filling your cell. Your father Frederick, a blade
jutting from his chest, slick with crimson. Your

00:17:43.102 --> 00:17:48.440
mother, Johanna, burned with irons, screaming.
Cassandra, running towards you, calling your name

00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:57.339
into the night, begging you to help. One, two,
three arrows. She falls. Darkness once more.

00:17:57.339 --> 00:18:07.300
Darkness and red. Red of blood. Red of burning
fire. The sky is fire. The world burns with flame

00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:13.529
and iron. The smoke rises from the cinders,
coalescing into a face, black as soot with eyes as

00:18:13.529 --> 00:18:21.414
burning coals, and a wicked grin. It speaks with a
raspy, rumbling bass, like a slow-moving

00:18:21.414 --> 00:18:33.843
landslide. "You hold your vengeance, Percival. You
made it. You only need to take it for yourself.

00:18:33.843 --> 00:18:46.935
"Make the world right. My gift is yours, and your
gift shall bring justice. Our bargain stands eager

00:18:46.935 --> 00:18:48.822
"to close."

00:18:48.822 --> 00:18:55.718
You suddenly come to consciousness, gasping loudly
against the air. You feel the warmth of the forge

00:18:55.718 --> 00:18:59.796
across the side of the workshop crawling across
your face. You are sitting at your workbench,

00:18:59.796 --> 00:19:04.906
having fallen asleep amidst a pile of contraptions
in mid-construction. As you look around, you can

00:19:04.906 --> 00:19:11.505
see your leather gloves are still on, apron on,
blackened soot spread across your face, and a

00:19:11.505 --> 00:19:16.646
series of things you were in mid-build on broken
before you on your workshop table.

00:19:16.646 --> 00:19:27.210
TALISEN: (sighs) How long have I been here?

00:19:27.210 --> 00:19:33.578
MATT: There's nobody in the room, and you have no
idea. You're underground in the workshop. You

00:19:33.578 --> 00:19:37.146
haven't seen the sun probably for a good day and a
half.

00:19:37.146 --> 00:19:40.122
ORION: It's a new day. I didn't waste it at all.

00:19:40.122 --> 00:19:44.199
MATT: You have no idea quite how long you've been
down here, and you've been left alone for quite

00:19:44.199 --> 00:19:45.970
some time.

00:19:45.970 --> 00:19:49.885
TALISEN: I'm going to head upstairs.

00:19:49.885 --> 00:19:57.805
MATT: You go and open the metallic door that leads
into your workshop and come around the corner, and

00:19:57.805 --> 00:20:05.985
there's a chair set in the corner, where Jarett
would be sitting, one of the head guards at your

00:20:05.985 --> 00:20:14.159
facility. Jarett, however, is standing, hands up
to his throat, going (choking sounds) with no

00:20:14.159 --> 00:20:16.095
visible assailant.

00:20:16.095 --> 00:20:19.064
TALIESIN: (shouting) Help!

00:20:19.064 --> 00:20:22.287
SAM: Are we there? No, we're not even there.

00:20:22.287 --> 00:20:24.955
MATT: I want you to go ahead and roll initiative.

00:20:24.955 --> 00:20:27.034
SAM: Oh shit, it's already started!

00:20:27.034 --> 00:20:30.072
LAURA: Trinket was down there.

00:20:30.072 --> 00:20:32.408
SAM: Was?

00:20:32.408 --> 00:20:35.557
LAURA: Don't say that!

00:20:35.557 --> 00:20:38.714
SAM: Just saying that Trinket died already.

00:20:38.714 --> 00:20:42.189
LAURA: Don't say it.

00:20:42.189 --> 00:20:43.866
TALIESIN: Natural 20. 28.

00:20:43.866 --> 00:20:46.070
(cheering)

00:20:46.070 --> 00:20:48.274
MATT: And that's how Percy does it.

00:20:48.274 --> 00:20:50.454
TRAVIS: What is with that dice and you, man?

00:20:50.454 --> 00:20:57.667
LIAM: You are the yin to Wil Wheaton's yang.

00:20:57.667 --> 00:21:04.840
TALIESIN: He was sitting here 20 minutes ago. I
rubbed him for luck when he was leaving the

00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:07.000
building.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:10.409
MARISHA: No, we have him. It's balance.

00:21:10.409 --> 00:21:23.502
MATT: All right. So what's your total?

00:21:23.502 --> 00:21:25.748
TALIESIN: 28.

00:21:25.748 --> 00:21:40.361
MATT: 28. (laughs) You are definitely-- Okay. You
are up first. What do you want to do? As you come

00:21:40.361 --> 00:21:44.518
around the corner and you see this visual in front
of you. If you want to go ahead and roll for

00:21:44.518 --> 00:21:45.949
Trinket, too.

00:21:45.949 --> 00:21:50.414
LAURA: (worried noises) Oh no!

00:21:50.414 --> 00:21:53.041
TALIESIN: So I just see him up like this?

00:21:53.041 --> 00:21:54.834
LAURA: 19.

00:21:54.834 --> 00:21:56.444
MATT: 19? Nice.

00:21:56.444 --> 00:22:03.105
TALIESIN: Just for some reference, does it look
like he's possessed, or does it look like he's

00:22:03.105 --> 00:22:04.510
trying to remove something?

00:22:04.510 --> 00:22:06.336
MATT: It looks like he's trying to remove
something from around his neck, and looking down,

00:22:06.336 --> 00:22:11.810
you can see his feet are actually off the ground,
kicking. It looks like there's a little bit of air

00:22:11.810 --> 00:22:14.333
wisping around behind him.

00:22:14.333 --> 00:22:18.211
TALIESIN: How insane would it be to try and make a
shot beneath his legs?

00:22:18.211 --> 00:22:21.142
MATT: You can certainly go for it and try.

00:22:21.142 --> 00:22:27.020
TALIESIN: I'm going to drop down. Can I make an
aimed shot against something I can't see?

00:22:27.020 --> 00:22:30.284
MATT: You can try, it'll be with disadvantage, but
you can definitely make it.

00:22:30.284 --> 00:22:36.563
ORION: He's in the kitchen?

00:22:36.563 --> 00:22:38.949
LAURA: No, he's downstairs.

00:22:38.949 --> 00:22:43.175
SAM: Can I request that the rest of us do the
sounds of the ricocheting bullets in case he

00:22:43.175 --> 00:22:44.554
misses?

00:22:44.554 --> 00:22:47.898
TALIESIN: Okay, I want 5.1; start here and make it
all the way down.

00:22:47.898 --> 00:22:52.108
LAURA: But you're not going to miss, so it doesn't
matter.

00:22:52.108 --> 00:22:56.012
TALIESIN: I'm going to take an aimed shot for my
first shot, and then start firing blindly.

00:22:56.012 --> 00:23:00.301
MATT: This will be disadvantage against an
invisible assailant.

00:23:00.301 --> 00:23:03.439
TRAVIS: It misses?

00:23:03.439 --> 00:23:08.478
TALIESIN: It missed. I'm just making sure I didn't
misfire. No, I didn't! Thank god.

00:23:08.478 --> 00:23:10.991
MATT: So what's the total?

00:23:10.991 --> 00:23:15.478
TALIESIN: 15.

00:23:15.478 --> 00:23:17.899
MATT: Total of 15? Still hits.

00:23:17.899 --> 00:23:35.884
TALIESIN: Still hits? 15 hits? Oh, that's 16
points of damage, and he has to make a

00:23:35.884 --> 00:23:38.284
constitution saving throw to not be knocked
prone.

00:23:38.284 --> 00:23:40.298
MATT: Okay. What's the DC on that?

00:23:40.298 --> 00:23:55.752
TALIESIN: Where is my DC? DC of eight plus my
proficiency mod, plus my dexterity mod, so 19.

00:23:55.752 --> 00:24:02.701
MATT: Sure enough. You see all of a sudden the air
go (gasp) and Jaret falls to his knees (coughs).

00:24:02.701 --> 00:24:06.218
TALIESIN: I'm going to take two more shots right
above his head.

00:24:06.218 --> 00:24:07.863
MATT: Go for it.

00:24:07.863 --> 00:24:09.209
SAM: Don't hit Jarett.

00:24:09.209 --> 00:24:11.001
MATT: Jarett's on his knees, prone, essentially.

00:24:11.001 --> 00:24:13.678
SAM: He could still hit Jarett! He's our best
guy.

00:24:13.678 --> 00:24:15.640
MATT: You still have disadvantage on these.

00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:16.630
TALIESIN: I don't?

00:24:16.630 --> 00:24:19.993
MATT: No, you still have disadvantage on these. It
is still an invisible creature.

00:24:19.993 --> 00:24:21.139
TALIESIN: 20.

00:24:21.139 --> 00:24:22.781
MATT: 20 hits.

00:24:22.781 --> 00:24:28.371
TALIESIN: That's 13.

00:24:28.371 --> 00:24:30.442
MATT: 13 does not hit.

00:24:30.442 --> 00:24:32.394
TALIESIN: No, 13 points of damage.

00:24:32.394 --> 00:24:33.751
MATT: Oh. Yes.

00:24:33.751 --> 00:24:40.046
TALIESIN: And then 20 again.

00:24:40.046 --> 00:24:42.928
MATT: 20 hits.

00:24:42.928 --> 00:24:44.495
TALIESIN: Nine points of damage.

00:24:44.495 --> 00:24:49.117
MATT: Nine points of damage. (gunshots) The
gunshots are echoing through the hallway. Whatever

00:24:49.117 --> 00:24:52.978
this weird entity is, you can see some of the
nearby cloth and dust swirl up from its movement,

00:24:52.978 --> 00:24:58.869
you hear this (gasping sound), this angry sucking
sound in the air around you. Do you want to move,

00:24:58.869 --> 00:25:00.867
or are you staying where you are?

00:25:00.867 --> 00:25:08.963
TALIESIN: I'm going to stay where I am. And I'm
going to keep yelling. Help! I don't think I have

00:25:08.963 --> 00:25:10.522
an earring.

00:25:10.522 --> 00:25:18.350
MATT: You see some sort of shimmer of wind come
around the corner towards you. This one turns

00:25:18.350 --> 00:25:23.969
around and (whooshing sound) over to the bars, and
you can see in the distance, it's moving over

00:25:23.969 --> 00:25:26.113
towards where your captive currently is.

00:25:26.113 --> 00:25:32.507
ORION: How far away are we from the keep?

00:25:32.507 --> 00:25:37.873
MATT: I'm getting to that. At the end of this
combat round, all of you guys are right toward the

00:25:37.873 --> 00:25:41.604
outskirts of the keep, and you hear the muffled
ringing of gunshots from the inside of the keep.

00:25:41.604 --> 00:25:43.278
ORION: We do hear that.

00:25:43.278 --> 00:25:45.754
MATT: You do hear this as you're just getting to
the outer gates.

00:25:45.754 --> 00:25:52.325
ORION: As soon as I hear that, I cast Fly on
myself and (whoosh).

00:25:52.325 --> 00:25:55.199
LAURA: Are you wearing an earring, Percy?

00:25:55.199 --> 00:26:04.271
MATT: No, he is not. The entity swooshes down the
stairs and comes at you. That's going to be a 22.

00:26:04.271 --> 00:26:05.575
TALIESIN: That hits.

00:26:05.575 --> 00:26:07.992
MATT: And a 12.

00:26:07.992 --> 00:26:09.522
TALIESIN: That does not.

00:26:09.522 --> 00:26:16.916
MATT: It swings towards you, and a giant slam of
extremely condensed air with a raking claw impact

00:26:16.916 --> 00:26:23.242
hits you in the torso, doing 15 points of
bludgeoning damage. The other one swings out, same

00:26:23.242 --> 00:26:26.575
direction. This time you actually pull off to the
side and knock it out of the way with your

00:26:26.575 --> 00:26:36.619
Pepperbox. The one back there is going to attempt
to grapple. Succeeds. That's its action, and you

00:26:36.619 --> 00:26:46.739
can see the driver that you had put into prison is
currently being (choking) making strangling sounds

00:26:46.739 --> 00:26:50.442
in the distance. That ends it. Trinket's up.

00:26:50.442 --> 00:27:00.179
LAURA: Trinket. He can see Percy getting attacked
and instinct takes over, and he runs forward and

00:27:00.179 --> 00:27:02.929
he claws him.

00:27:02.929 --> 00:27:05.391
MATT: All right, go ahead and roll for the
attack.

00:27:05.391 --> 00:27:12.194
LAURA: That does not hit. That's a natural 20.

00:27:12.194 --> 00:27:15.914
MATT: That will hit! (laughs) It begins.

00:27:15.914 --> 00:27:22.705
LAURA: Oh, that's the wrong thing. That's a 2d4.

00:27:22.705 --> 00:27:28.630
MATT: So roll 2d4 and then multiply those by two.

00:27:28.630 --> 00:27:31.179
LAURA: 17 damage.

00:27:31.179 --> 00:27:39.796
MATT: 17 damage, nice. Trinket runs up, coming out
of his somewhat sleepy stupor, goes for a bite

00:27:39.796 --> 00:27:43.645
attack and grabs nothing with it, and turns around
and rakes a claw backwards, manages to get the

00:27:43.645 --> 00:27:48.927
back of whatever this entity is, and you hear it
scream (gasping scream). You do, at least.

00:27:48.927 --> 00:27:53.050
TALIESIN: I have a technical dispute, really
quickly. Could the wraith have gotten that far,

00:27:53.050 --> 00:27:54.946
since I knocked him prone?

00:27:54.946 --> 00:28:00.806
MATT: Yes, it could've, because it uses half its
movement speed to get up.

00:28:00.806 --> 00:28:02.187
TALIESIN: Oh, thank you. Never mind.

00:28:02.187 --> 00:28:03.643
MATT: Its movement is actually 50.

00:28:03.643 --> 00:28:05.560
TALIESIN: Ignore me! 50?!

00:28:05.560 --> 00:28:11.398
MATT: Not that you know that. But it moved far for
what you think it should've been able to.

00:28:11.398 --> 00:28:15.264
ORION: By the way, for the record, Matthew, I have
no idea what we're fighting.

00:28:15.264 --> 00:28:17.086
TRAVIS: Nobody does.

00:28:17.086 --> 00:28:19.648
ORION: I'm just saying, I haven't meta-gamed
here.

00:28:19.648 --> 00:28:22.186
MATT: Congrats. (laughs) I'm proud of you.

00:28:22.186 --> 00:28:24.140
LIAM: Fresh start.

00:28:24.140 --> 00:28:36.573
MATT: Jarett then gets up, sees this happening,
moves over, and pulls out the key to try and open

00:28:36.573 --> 00:28:42.177
the prison door. Spends the turn doing so. Manages
to get the door open. That's the end of Jarett's

00:28:42.177 --> 00:28:47.144
turn. Okay, now, the rest of you guys roll
initiative.

00:28:47.144 --> 00:28:53.046
TRAVIS: Okay. Come on, you giant ball-bearing.
Damn.

00:28:53.046 --> 00:28:56.874
LAURA: Does that count, if I hit it into my box
and it slammed into the side? Does that count, or

00:28:56.874 --> 00:28:58.886
should I let it roll naturally?

00:28:58.886 --> 00:29:07.442
MATT: Let it roll naturally. That would normally
count, but it's fine. Wherever it lands, you take

00:29:07.442 --> 00:29:11.501
it, going forward. Okay, so 25 to 20?

00:29:11.501 --> 00:29:14.646
SAM: Oh, initiative?

00:29:14.646 --> 00:29:17.673
TALIESIN: Keep up, people! Come on.

00:29:17.673 --> 00:29:20.974
MATT: You hear the gunshot. You're entering this
intensity.

00:29:20.974 --> 00:29:25.640
SAM: I don't think it's anything. I think it's
just him tinkering.

00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:36.343
MATT: So Scanlan stays behind. 25 to 20? 20 to 15?
What are your scores?

00:29:36.343 --> 00:29:37.821
LIAM and ORION: 15.

00:29:37.821 --> 00:29:39.483
LAURA: 17.

00:29:39.483 --> 00:29:41.578
MARISHA and TRAVIS: 16.

00:29:41.578 --> 00:29:45.475
TALIESIN: Thank you all, by the way, for leaving a
bear on suicide watch. That was really cool.

00:29:45.475 --> 00:29:47.108
LAURA: You're welcome.

00:29:47.108 --> 00:29:56.070
MATT: Vex, what'd you get again?

00:29:56.070 --> 00:29:57.666
TRAVIS: 17.

00:29:57.666 --> 00:29:59.429
LAURA: I got 17.

00:29:59.429 --> 00:30:03.039
SAM: He got 15.

00:30:03.039 --> 00:30:05.998
MATT: 15, Tiberius. And what'd you get, Vax?

00:30:05.998 --> 00:30:07.094
LIAM: 15.

00:30:07.094 --> 00:30:10.113
MATT: 15, all right. Three 15s.

00:30:10.113 --> 00:30:12.460
SAM: I got three.

00:30:12.460 --> 00:30:22.210
MATT: You got three? Okay. All right, so you guys
all spend your turn, if you choose to, to rush

00:30:22.249 --> 00:30:27.384
through the gates. As soon as the gunshots go off,
you can see Shayne's up on top, and she sees it,

00:30:27.384 --> 00:30:32.682
gives a quick turn, and you can see the gates
begin to open, and you hear this angry grunting as

00:30:32.682 --> 00:30:36.595
your half-orc guard is now pulling the doors open
as fast as he can. You guys find a moment and slip

00:30:36.595 --> 00:30:40.668
through, running towards the front of the keep.
You guys manage to get, with full dash and full

00:30:40.668 --> 00:30:43.875
turn, including your flight-- because you fly a
little bit faster, but you have a little more of

00:30:43.875 --> 00:30:47.334
an arc to get over-- you guys get to the front of
the keep this turn. So you won't get into this

00:30:47.334 --> 00:30:51.882
until next round. That brings it back to the top.
Percy, you're up.

00:30:51.882 --> 00:31:05.104
TALIESIN: (sighs) There's no way I can fire at the
one who's far away from me right now, is there?

00:31:05.104 --> 00:31:07.623
MATT: It's hard to see.

00:31:07.623 --> 00:31:09.409
LAURA: But Jarett's got him.

00:31:09.409 --> 00:31:10.958
TALIESIN: I can ignore cover, though.

00:31:10.958 --> 00:31:15.286
MATT: You can ignore cover, but you have this
entity in front of you. I mean, you'll be at

00:31:15.286 --> 00:31:18.681
disadvantage regardless, because you're shooting
at something invisible, and you have something

00:31:18.681 --> 00:31:20.983
that's in melee of you and you have a ranged
weapon.

00:31:20.983 --> 00:31:26.448
TALIESIN: I'm going to see if there's a charge
left in my glove and try and take the-- there

00:31:26.448 --> 00:31:28.947
wouldn't be a charge left in my glove, would
there?

00:31:28.947 --> 00:31:31.983
MATT: You glance down at the glove, and you see
the gemstone in the center of the palm is

00:31:31.983 --> 00:31:34.452
currently dark and lifeless.

00:31:34.452 --> 00:31:41.587
TALIESIN: Okay. (sighs) Hold on, sorry.

00:31:41.587 --> 00:31:43.965
TRAVIS: Fan the hammer, motherfuck.

00:31:43.965 --> 00:31:58.348
TALIESIN: It gets weird when it's up close. Okay.
Let's see what we do. All right. There's no way I

00:31:58.348 --> 00:32:00.448
can step back right now, is there?

00:32:00.448 --> 00:32:03.493
MATT: Currently? I mean, you can if you want to.
It'll get a free strike on you.

00:32:03.493 --> 00:32:05.553
TALIESIN: Okay, I'm going to try and take shots,
then.

00:32:05.553 --> 00:32:11.241
MATT: The one in front of you? Okay. Go for it.
With disadvantage on each shot.

00:32:11.241 --> 00:32:16.794
TALIESIN: Firing with disadvantage? Screw it, I'm
going to take my first one with sharpshooter to

00:32:16.794 --> 00:32:24.187
see if I can do any damage that way. Nope.
Actually, that's a misfire.

00:32:24.187 --> 00:32:27.711
MATT: So Pepperbox (explosion sound). You go to
shoot, and--

00:32:27.711 --> 00:32:32.395
MARISHA: (ricochet sound)

00:32:32.395 --> 00:32:38.488
MATT: The barrel gets clogged, and the front of it
actually catches fire for a second, and you have

00:32:38.488 --> 00:32:43.120
to shake it out right now. It's completely offset,
and it's going to take a moment to even get it to

00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:45.105
where you can fire again.

00:32:45.105 --> 00:32:50.783
TALIESIN: Okay. Do I have six seconds?

00:32:50.783 --> 00:32:54.158
MATT: You do. And you've used one attack. You have
two more attacks.

00:32:54.158 --> 00:32:57.524
TALIESIN: Well, it misfired.

00:32:57.524 --> 00:33:00.590
MATT: Yeah, that weapon you have to use an action
to repair.

00:33:00.590 --> 00:33:06.905
TALIESIN: Okay. I'm going to do something a little
weird. I'm going to pull out Bad News. I know I

00:33:06.905 --> 00:33:10.663
can't shoot this close with it, or god only knows
what would happen. I'm going to try and swing it

00:33:10.663 --> 00:33:14.663
like a pugil stick, and I'm going to try and hit
him with the butt of Bad News.

00:33:14.663 --> 00:33:20.102
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and make a melee attack. This
is strength-based. Add your proficiency modifier

00:33:20.102 --> 00:33:22.128
and your strength modifier.

00:33:22.128 --> 00:33:24.388
TALIESIN: 15?

00:33:24.388 --> 00:33:28.459
MATT: You still have disadvantage on it because
you can't see it. And you're not proficient.

00:33:28.459 --> 00:33:29.596
TALIESIN: 15?

00:33:29.596 --> 00:33:31.436
MATT: 15 just barely hits.

00:33:31.436 --> 00:33:33.317
(cheering)

00:33:33.317 --> 00:33:45.524
MATT: All right, so go ahead and roll-- with the
size of Bad News, I'd say 1d6, plus your strength

00:33:45.524 --> 00:33:46.589
modifier.

00:33:46.589 --> 00:33:47.894
TALIESIN: Four.

00:33:47.894 --> 00:33:52.598
MATT: Okay, so four points of damage, as you
bludgeon it. You took a turn to get it out. Your

00:33:52.598 --> 00:33:57.436
third attack is then slamming it in the side.
Whatever entity you smacked gets pushed against

00:33:57.436 --> 00:34:00.985
the wall. Go ahead and roll a d20 for me.

00:34:00.985 --> 00:34:04.539
TALIESIN: 14.

00:34:04.539 --> 00:34:10.754
MATT: Okay. So the impact does not appear to
damage Bad News in this instance. It is a fragile

00:34:10.754 --> 00:34:17.816
construct, and even doing melee attacks with it
does subject it to a misfire possibility.

00:34:17.816 --> 00:34:20.648
TALIESIN: I hit it with the stock, I was careful.

00:34:20.648 --> 00:34:23.454
MATT: I know. Okay, so that concludes your turn?

00:34:23.454 --> 00:34:26.621
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm kind of-- yeah.

00:34:26.621 --> 00:34:29.786
MATT: Okay, you stay there. All right. The one
that's in front of you now is going to go ahead

00:34:29.786 --> 00:34:35.007
and go over this way. Trinket-- well, no, it's
still in melee, so it doesn't actually get an

00:34:35.007 --> 00:34:40.259
attack. It does get two strikes on you. That is a
17.

00:34:40.259 --> 00:34:41.436
TALIESIN: Nope.

00:34:41.436 --> 00:34:43.393
MATT: And that is 18.

00:34:43.393 --> 00:34:45.707
TALIESIN: Armor class is 18.

00:34:45.707 --> 00:34:47.229
MATT: So it does just hit you.

00:34:47.229 --> 00:34:48.984
TALIESIN: Can I do that crazy thing?

00:34:48.984 --> 00:34:51.609
MATT: No, I've eliminated that.

00:34:51.609 --> 00:34:55.603
TALIESIN: Oh, you've removed that. Okay, never
mind. I don't have the new update, sorry. I don't

00:34:55.603 --> 00:34:57.256
have a dodge anymore, right?

00:34:57.256 --> 00:35:04.121
MATT: No, the dodge is not there. It rarely came
into play. Okay, so that puts you at another 15

00:35:04.121 --> 00:35:08.791
points of bludgeoning damage as it just smacks you
right across the head. Your eyes go dizzy for a

00:35:08.791 --> 00:35:13.103
second, and you take a minute to refocus your
vision, and you can now see in the air, the

00:35:13.103 --> 00:35:19.086
shimmering expression that looks like a humanoid
face stretched and ghastly going (gasps) in front

00:35:19.086 --> 00:35:22.940
of you, but it's still barely even visible, and
only because of the proximity to you are you able

00:35:22.940 --> 00:35:28.329
to actually make out any sort of shape or shimmer
in the air in front of you. The other one is

00:35:28.329 --> 00:35:44.919
attempting to choke out the prisoner. However, the
prisoner resists through athletics, so he's

00:35:44.919 --> 00:35:51.502
currently holding back at bay the strength of the
entity. That ends its turn. Trinket's up.

00:35:51.502 --> 00:35:59.000
LAURA: Trinket's up! He's going to try to jump and
land on top of the ghostly thing and bite its

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:02.128
face. I don't know how to do that.

00:36:02.128 --> 00:36:08.828
MATT: (laughs) To do a real leap, Trinket would
have to back up and then run towards it. If

00:36:08.828 --> 00:36:14.672
Trinket wants to do that. Okay. So Trinket backs
up. As it does, it gets one free swipe at Trinket.

00:36:14.672 --> 00:36:17.420
That is 18 to hit.

00:36:17.420 --> 00:36:24.611
LAURA: I'm having an issue here. Because I have 18
in parentheses, and then I wrote a 20 and I

00:36:24.611 --> 00:36:26.575
circled it and I don't know why.

00:36:26.575 --> 00:36:28.101
MATT: I don't know why, either.

00:36:28.101 --> 00:36:29.310
LAURA: 18 is probably--

00:36:29.310 --> 00:36:32.423
MATT: Yeah, we'll say 18. So that hits. Trinket
takes 15 points of bludgeoning damage as the

00:36:32.423 --> 00:36:36.885
entity swings out and backhands Trinket. However
Trinket now leaps-- go ahead and make an athletics

00:36:36.885 --> 00:36:38.005
check.

00:36:38.005 --> 00:36:39.972
LIAM: He has better armor class than I do.

00:36:39.972 --> 00:36:42.030
SAM: Does he have armor?

00:36:42.030 --> 00:36:47.374
LAURA: He does! He's got his bulette armor, man.
He's a cannonball. What am I doing? A strength?

00:36:47.374 --> 00:36:48.892
MATT: Athletics, yeah.

00:36:48.892 --> 00:36:50.696
LAURA: 17?

00:36:50.696 --> 00:36:57.047
MATT: 17. Yeah. Trinket leaps forward, slamming
this entity onto the ground and knocking it prone,

00:36:57.047 --> 00:36:59.059
and you get to go ahead and make a bite attack.

00:36:59.059 --> 00:37:03.489
LAURA: Yes! That didn't count because it slipped
out of my hand. That was even worse than the other

00:37:03.489 --> 00:37:10.061
one. So 11. It slipped out of my hand. It
shouldn't count if it goes like that! 20.

00:37:10.061 --> 00:37:15.888
MATT: So Trinket manages to knock it prone,
however, because it gets pushed out of the way,

00:37:15.888 --> 00:37:19.351
Trinket has a hard time, Trinket just makes a big
slash and a bite out in the air where it once was

00:37:19.351 --> 00:37:20.969
and misses entirely.

00:37:20.969 --> 00:37:23.307
LAURA: But he's gone prone.

00:37:23.307 --> 00:37:30.154
MATT: But he is knocked prone. Jarett's now going
to attempt to grapple the entity.

00:37:30.154 --> 00:37:32.105
SAM: Wait, Trinket missed? (ricochet sound)

00:37:32.105 --> 00:37:35.644
(laughter)

00:37:35.644 --> 00:37:39.075
MATT: Jarett manages to reach out and grab onto
whatever this creature is, hold onto it, just

00:37:39.075 --> 00:37:45.159
grappling, and is going to attempt to try and pull
it back. For this, I will do a contested roll on

00:37:45.159 --> 00:37:52.314
that. It rolled a one. Jarett pulled it back that
far, managing to let go of its quarry, and is

00:37:52.314 --> 00:37:59.148
currently holding onto some sort of angry,
whirling entity at that point. That ends Jarett's

00:37:59.148 --> 00:38:10.819
turn. The rest of you guys all manage to make your
way up into the armory up top. First is Vex. You

00:38:10.819 --> 00:38:15.265
rush in there, and what do you want to do?

00:38:15.265 --> 00:38:17.658
LAURA: I want to run down and shoot something.

00:38:17.658 --> 00:38:22.603
MATT: Okay. You can get just about there.

00:38:22.603 --> 00:38:26.110
LAURA: Can I see anything? Can I ricochet an arrow
to hit?

00:38:26.110 --> 00:38:32.814
MATT: (laughs) I would say this guy has
three-quarters cover, so it would be disadvantage

00:38:32.814 --> 00:38:39.321
on the attack. You already have disadvantage
because it's invisible, so it's hard to hit,

00:38:39.321 --> 00:38:40.681
regardless.

00:38:40.681 --> 00:38:47.060
LAURA: That was the same one each time. 28.

00:38:47.060 --> 00:38:49.027
MATT: 28? 28 hits.

00:38:49.027 --> 00:39:05.061
LAURA: Oh, I didn't fucking Hunter's Mark him.
God damn it. Fuck. 15.

00:39:05.061 --> 00:39:09.107
MATT: 15 points of damage. The first arrow sinks
into whatever's there, and you can see it jutting

00:39:09.107 --> 00:39:10.817
out of no physical space.

00:39:10.817 --> 00:39:13.468
LAURA: Now I'm going to Hunter's Mark him and I'm
going to hit him again. Can I do that?

00:39:13.468 --> 00:39:16.469
MATT: Technically, it's part of your attack. You
can do two attacks first, then you can bonus

00:39:16.469 --> 00:39:19.108
action, so you're like (arrow sounds) and then you
Hunter's Mark it after.

00:39:19.108 --> 00:39:24.615
LAURA: All right. That one doesn't hit. Doesn't
matter. Doesn't hit anyway. I missed it.

00:39:24.615 --> 00:39:25.978
SAM: (ricochet sound)

00:39:25.978 --> 00:39:31.175
MATT: Second shot shatters against the back wall
of the stone. You can Hunter's Mark for your

00:39:31.175 --> 00:39:32.310
bonus.

00:39:32.310 --> 00:39:33.550
LAURA: I Hunter's Mark him.

00:39:33.550 --> 00:39:42.369
MATT: All right. Entity is now Hunter's Marked.
That ends Vex's turn. Keyleth, you now also make

00:39:42.369 --> 00:39:44.131
your way into the doorway.

00:39:44.131 --> 00:39:45.713
MARISHA: How far can I get?

00:39:45.713 --> 00:39:52.239
MATT: About there. Nothing's in visual sight right
now, unfortunately.

00:39:52.239 --> 00:39:53.799
MARISHA: Nothing's in visual sight?

00:39:53.799 --> 00:39:58.692
MATT: No, half of that was getting to that point.
You could dash and try and make your way in, but

00:39:58.692 --> 00:40:00.333
you wouldn't be able to do anything.

00:40:00.333 --> 00:40:02.161
MARISHA: Can I dash and then make a bonus action?

00:40:02.161 --> 00:40:12.049
MATT: You could, yeah. Your call. What do you got?
Grog, you're on deck.

00:40:12.049 --> 00:40:14.350
MARISHA: I'll just wait.

00:40:14.350 --> 00:40:18.470
MATT: Okay. Keyleth waits there. Grog, you're up.

00:40:18.470 --> 00:40:23.264
MARISHA: Let me just scootch over so I can be
behind Vex.

00:40:23.264 --> 00:40:28.998
MATT: You have a little better movement, so you
actually manage to get two more squares in. What's

00:40:28.998 --> 00:40:30.379
your speed again?

00:40:30.379 --> 00:40:31.339
TRAVIS: 50.

00:40:31.339 --> 00:40:33.956
MATT: 50? Yeah, you manage to get up to there, and
now your turn begins.

00:40:33.956 --> 00:40:41.628
TRAVIS: I go into a rage, and I come in, and I
turn to the right, and I run up as close as I can

00:40:41.628 --> 00:40:42.973
to Jared--

00:40:42.973 --> 00:40:44.239
LAURA: Jarett.

00:40:44.239 --> 00:40:46.944
TRAVIS: Yeah, Jarett. And wispy fuck.

00:40:46.944 --> 00:40:52.947
MATT: All right, so you charge in. Angry, you see
Jarett's currently reaching back and trying to go

00:40:52.947 --> 00:40:56.924
for his crossbow now that this entity's in his
face. He's grappled it with one arm and he's

00:40:56.924 --> 00:41:00.966
reaching back to try and grab it. You come rushing
in. Go for it.

00:41:00.966 --> 00:41:08.059
TRAVIS: I take out a holy oil vial out of the Bag
of Holding, I crush it in my hand, and I take a

00:41:08.059 --> 00:41:10.267
swing at whatever he's holding.

00:41:10.267 --> 00:41:16.330
MATT: All right. Cool. So as you pull out (glass
breaking) the pain from the glass even further

00:41:16.330 --> 00:41:21.324
angers you in your rage. You can see a mix of holy
water and blood trickle down from your fist as you

00:41:21.324 --> 00:41:25.021
clench it. Go ahead and swing for a punch with
disadvantage.

00:41:25.021 --> 00:41:26.782
TRAVIS: That's a one.

00:41:26.782 --> 00:41:32.899
MATT: So that first strike just whiffs over.
Through your anger, you're unable to focus on

00:41:32.899 --> 00:41:34.334
where this entity may be.

00:41:34.334 --> 00:41:39.914
TRAVIS: Not off to a good start with this. Number
two. Disadvantage. Fuck.

00:41:39.914 --> 00:41:43.097
MATT: What's the total?

00:41:43.097 --> 00:41:44.857
TRAVIS: 15.

00:41:44.857 --> 00:41:47.756
MATT: 15 just barely hits. Go ahead and roll.

00:41:47.756 --> 00:41:49.328
TRAVIS: One of these guys?

00:41:49.328 --> 00:41:51.361
MATT: Go ahead and roll that. Half that damage,
yes.

00:41:51.361 --> 00:41:55.717
TRAVIS: One. Plus rage, which is--

00:41:55.717 --> 00:41:57.227
MATT: Plus strength.

00:41:57.227 --> 00:42:01.506
TRAVIS: Oh, right. Eight.

00:42:01.506 --> 00:42:07.280
MATT: So eight points of damage to it. All righty.
(whack) It hits, and you hear this (yelps) sound

00:42:07.280 --> 00:42:12.609
as it takes the impact, and you can see this
strange, angry face appear suddenly out of the

00:42:12.609 --> 00:42:16.538
shimmering air that just then disperses again, and
you don't quite know where it is. You can make a

00:42:16.538 --> 00:42:18.036
third strike now, if you want.

00:42:18.036 --> 00:42:19.378
LAURA: Did it do any holy damage?

00:42:19.378 --> 00:42:21.624
MATT: Did not appear to have any additional effect
on the entity.

00:42:21.624 --> 00:42:27.572
TRAVIS: Well, hell, it was worth a shot. Oh, at
disadvantage. 19.

00:42:27.572 --> 00:42:30.259
MATT: 19 still hits. Go ahead and roll the next
attack.

00:42:30.259 --> 00:42:32.080
TRAVIS: Eight again.

00:42:32.080 --> 00:42:37.655
MATT: Eight damage again. (whack) You backhand it
with your third strike, this time finding the edge

00:42:37.655 --> 00:42:42.843
of its face again, and you see the chair right
next to it tumble as it barely manages to catch

00:42:42.843 --> 00:42:48.943
itself and keep itself aloft. Nevertheless, this
strange invisible entity is still there holding

00:42:48.943 --> 00:42:50.080
its ground.

00:42:50.080 --> 00:42:52.656
TRAVIS: Would you say the blood from my hand is
splattering Jarett behind him?

00:42:52.656 --> 00:42:56.118
MATT: You look over at Jarett. Jarett's currently
trying to grab onto the creature and keep it

00:42:56.118 --> 00:42:58.736
grappled. So yeah, it's spattering on him.

00:42:58.736 --> 00:43:00.273
TRAVIS: I'm a painter.

00:43:00.273 --> 00:43:08.775
MATT: (laughs) All right, that ends Grog's turn.
Vax and Tiberius. You guys both get up to the edge

00:43:08.775 --> 00:43:10.310
of this room here.

00:43:10.310 --> 00:43:14.746
ORION: Your cape is looking really nice, Vax.

00:43:14.746 --> 00:43:22.091
LIAM: I'm clicking my Boots of Haste, and I get
double movement, so I get to go 60 feet. I'm going

00:43:22.091 --> 00:43:28.232
to slink up right beside Trinket and stab the shit
out of this invisible thing.

00:43:28.232 --> 00:43:32.454
ORION: Stab him! Hey, what do they look like?

00:43:32.454 --> 00:43:42.549
LIAM: So because Trinket's right there, this is a
sneak attack. That hits. That is 29 to hit.

00:43:42.549 --> 00:43:47.606
MATT: That'll hit.

00:43:47.606 --> 00:43:50.379
(laughter)

00:43:50.379 --> 00:43:54.276
MATT: It is prone. It is invisible but it is
prone, so that evens out to no advantage or

00:43:54.276 --> 00:43:55.969
disadvantage.

00:43:55.969 --> 00:44:10.195
LIAM: (counting) 25 for the first hit.

00:44:10.195 --> 00:44:12.498
MATT: 25, all right.

00:44:12.498 --> 00:44:15.222
LAURA: Don't you double it? You had to double 19.

00:44:15.222 --> 00:44:20.707
LIAM: No, he didn't-- that's a critical hit.

00:44:20.707 --> 00:44:22.605
LAURA: Oh, right.

00:44:22.605 --> 00:44:32.629
LIAM: One shy. So now out comes the Dagger of
Life-Stealing. It misses-- well, does 15 hit?

00:44:32.629 --> 00:44:34.118
MATT: 15 just barely hits.

00:44:34.118 --> 00:44:40.937
LIAM: Just barely hits? Oh, that's better than I
thought. That is three plus six is nine for

00:44:40.937 --> 00:44:49.760
damage, and then the Keen Dagger comes back, and
that gets a 27, so that also hits for nine of

00:44:49.760 --> 00:44:51.069
damage.

00:44:51.069 --> 00:44:55.035
MATT: All right. So as you rush over, you stab
downward. You hear this (gurgle) sound as your

00:44:55.035 --> 00:44:58.238
blade comes down into whatever entity's there, and
your hand moves around as it struggles against the

00:44:58.238 --> 00:45:01.663
blade. You pull it out, grab your other dagger,
and then throw it in the air, catch it, slam it

00:45:01.663 --> 00:45:04.190
down again for that third strike, and then pull
back and stab a third time.

00:45:04.190 --> 00:45:10.496
LIAM: And Trinket is very comforting, pressed
against my shoulder as I do all that. He's

00:45:10.496 --> 00:45:11.746
supple.

00:45:11.746 --> 00:45:18.620
MATT: Supple bear. #SuppleBear. All right, that
ends your turn. Tiberius, what are you doing?

00:45:18.620 --> 00:45:20.257
ORION: How far can I get?

00:45:20.257 --> 00:45:27.561
MATT: That's about as far as you can get with your
movement. You currently do not have visual on

00:45:27.561 --> 00:45:31.733
either of them. You're flying. What's your fly
speed?

00:45:31.733 --> 00:45:33.760
ORION: 60 feet.

00:45:33.760 --> 00:45:36.436
MATT: You said that last time, and we found out it
was 40, I believe wasn't it?

00:45:36.436 --> 00:45:43.510
ORION: Was it 40? I thought it was 60. It was
double the-- shit, hold on. I have a card--

00:45:43.510 --> 00:45:47.069
MATT: You have a card and yet I find it faster.

00:45:47.069 --> 00:45:48.650
ORION: 60 feet.

00:45:48.650 --> 00:45:53.819
MATT: It is 60. You're right. Yeah, so you can go
double. You are now just coasting down the

00:45:53.819 --> 00:45:55.169
stairway.

00:45:55.169 --> 00:45:57.912
ORION: I'm going to attempt something I haven't
actually tried before.

00:45:57.912 --> 00:45:59.323
MATT: All right, go for it.

00:45:59.323 --> 00:46:02.410
ORION: Because there's one to my right and one to
my left, right?

00:46:02.410 --> 00:46:06.745
MATT: Correct. There's one over here that has Grog
and Jarett flanking. The other one has Percy, Vax,

00:46:06.745 --> 00:46:11.950
and Trinket all around it. That one's actually
prone on the ground. It's hard to see normally;

00:46:11.950 --> 00:46:14.458
it's very hard to see now that it's swarmed.

00:46:14.458 --> 00:46:17.921
ORION: Do I have visual of both wraiths?

00:46:17.921 --> 00:46:21.092
MATT: You have visual of both entities, whatever
they are.

00:46:21.092 --> 00:46:28.813
ORION: Okay, sorry. I call them wraiths. Okay, so.
I'm going to cast at--

00:46:28.813 --> 00:46:31.372
SAM: Have we rested, by the way?

00:46:31.372 --> 00:46:33.935
MATT: No, you have not rested yet.

00:46:33.935 --> 00:46:36.321
SAM: So we're down a bunch of spells.

00:46:36.321 --> 00:46:38.391
MATT: Yeah, you're still where you were when you
came back.

00:46:38.391 --> 00:46:40.891
MARISHA: Well, to be fair, we talked. We didn't
have a battle.

00:46:40.891 --> 00:46:45.340
SAM: Some of us used spells. Fly and stuff.

00:46:45.340 --> 00:46:50.171
ORION: I'm going to try to do this about now. I'm
going to look to my right and my left and at

00:46:50.171 --> 00:46:56.658
6th-level I'm going to try to do Glacial Blast and
split the damage and try to hit both of them.

00:46:56.658 --> 00:47:00.081
Because it does 8d8 damage--

00:47:00.081 --> 00:47:02.009
MATT: Are you doing this single-stream?

00:47:02.009 --> 00:47:08.392
ORION: I'm trying to split my arc. So instead of
doing this, I'm trying to-- (ice sounds)

00:47:08.392 --> 00:47:13.465
MATT: Okay. How much damage is it?

00:47:13.465 --> 00:47:15.955
ORION: At sixth level, it's 8d8 damage.

00:47:15.955 --> 00:47:18.113
MATT: Okay, and what's the saving throw?

00:47:18.113 --> 00:47:21.522
ORION: 17.

00:47:21.522 --> 00:47:32.148
MATT: 17, okay. Jarett and Vax have to make saving
throws, as well. Go ahead and make that. Jarett

00:47:32.148 --> 00:47:37.533
rolled an 18 and has high dex, so yeah, Jarett
makes his save. That's half-damage for Jarett.

00:47:37.533 --> 00:47:39.150
LIAM: 28 for me.

00:47:39.150 --> 00:47:46.832
MATT: All right. So you take no damage, because
you're a rogue. Go ahead and roll damage. That's

00:47:46.832 --> 00:47:51.459
18 for one. This one fails, this one succeeds.

00:47:51.459 --> 00:47:55.866
ORION: Cool. Right hand does-- oh, sweet.

00:47:55.866 --> 00:47:59.357
MARISHA: No. That's a d10. These are d8s.

00:47:59.357 --> 00:48:02.673
ORION: Sorry, my bad.

00:48:02.673 --> 00:48:05.868
MATT: It's actually not prone. They're immune to
being prone.

00:48:05.868 --> 00:48:16.854
ORION: Right hand-- that's 14 to my right, and
then 18 to my left.

00:48:16.854 --> 00:48:19.897
MATT: So how much is that?

00:48:19.897 --> 00:48:22.092
ORION: So 14 to my right, 18 to my left.

00:48:22.092 --> 00:48:25.190
MATT: Okay. Got you.

00:48:25.190 --> 00:48:32.504
ORION: The one that doesn't save gets (freezing
sound).

00:48:32.504 --> 00:48:39.428
MATT: It would if it wasn't immune. However, as
you arc down, the ice blast comes through. You can

00:48:39.428 --> 00:48:43.554
see Vax manages to pull down to the ground and get
out of the way in time. Jarett ducks out of the

00:48:43.554 --> 00:48:47.529
way and it blasts over, hitting both these
entities. Ice crackles around both their forms,

00:48:47.529 --> 00:48:59.495
but then the forms shift out of it. That ends your
turn right there. Comes back to Scanlan.

00:48:59.495 --> 00:49:01.357
SAM: Oh, where am I?

00:49:01.357 --> 00:49:04.015
MATT: You are right there. Just entered the room
behind everybody else.

00:49:04.015 --> 00:49:08.318
SAM: Where does Percy do his tinkering?

00:49:08.318 --> 00:49:09.716
MATT: Over here.

00:49:09.716 --> 00:49:12.055
SAM: Because I can't see what's going on down
there.

00:49:12.055 --> 00:49:17.568
MATT: No, you just see, currently, these three
down the hallway. You can just see Tiberius blast

00:49:17.568 --> 00:49:19.565
a bunch of ice, arc in the air.

00:49:19.565 --> 00:49:26.029
SAM: Okay, so I know there's shit going on down
there, but I can't really see what. So I would

00:49:26.029 --> 00:49:34.687
probably just Dimension Door into the tinkering
room, because that's where I assume Percy is. And

00:49:34.687 --> 00:49:40.029
then I see what's going on, and nobody's there. Do
I have line-of-sight on anybody?

00:49:40.029 --> 00:49:43.660
MATT: Currently, you see Percy through this
doorway right there.

00:49:43.660 --> 00:49:47.677
SAM: Okay. Well, then. I can move also, can't I?

00:49:47.677 --> 00:49:49.313
MATT: Yeah, Dimension Door is your action.

00:49:49.313 --> 00:50:00.970
SAM: I'll move towards him. Oh, then I see a crazy
thing in front of me. Shit. So I probably take a

00:50:00.970 --> 00:50:02.303
couple steps back.

00:50:02.303 --> 00:50:07.283
(laughter)

00:50:07.283 --> 00:50:19.862
SAM: And then I'll inspire Percy. (sings) All the
single Percys, all the single Percys.

00:50:19.862 --> 00:50:27.681
ALL: (sing) All the single Percys, all the single
Percys, put your guns up-up-up.

00:50:27.681 --> 00:50:30.053
MATT: d10 inspiration dice to you, Percy.

00:50:30.053 --> 00:50:31.567
TALIESIN: What is that, a d10?

00:50:31.567 --> 00:50:35.453
MATT: d10, yeah. That brings it to the top of the
combat round. Percy, you're up first.

00:50:35.453 --> 00:50:39.073
TALIESIN: I'm going to use my action to try and
clear my gun.

00:50:39.073 --> 00:50:42.077
MATT: Okay. So go ahead and make your check.

00:50:42.077 --> 00:50:45.293
TALIESIN: What is that again? Did it change
since last time?

00:50:45.293 --> 00:50:48.055
MATT: That one shouldn't have changed, no.

00:50:48.055 --> 00:50:59.761
TALIESIN: Okay, so it's 11. I'm adding my bonus
die. God damn it. Nine.

00:50:59.761 --> 00:51:07.893
MATT: Nine. As you pull over your Pepperbox,
you're like, (ping). The actual barrel comes off

00:51:07.893 --> 00:51:11.634
and hits the ground and rolls off toward the back
of the room.

00:51:11.634 --> 00:51:22.487
TALIESIN: I'm tossing it into my room. I'm using
an action surge. Actually, can I even do that?

00:51:22.487 --> 00:51:30.849
Yes, I'm going to use my action surge, and I'm
going to walk over to the wraith on the ground,

00:51:30.849 --> 00:51:34.748
put the barrel of Bad News up to it, and pull the
trigger.

00:51:34.748 --> 00:51:38.558
MATT: The wraith is no longer on the ground, by
the way.

00:51:38.558 --> 00:51:39.923
TALIESIN: Is he not?

00:51:39.923 --> 00:51:45.655
MATT: The entity actually, upon looking, is immune
to being prone. So we won't retcon anything, but

00:51:45.655 --> 00:51:48.605
as you go to pull the barrel up, you can see now
the face is standing up before you.

00:51:48.605 --> 00:51:51.318
TALIESIN: I'm just going to try and shove it until
I hit something and then pull.

00:51:51.318 --> 00:51:56.072
MATT: Okay, so go ahead and roll with disadvantage
with Bad News.

00:51:56.072 --> 00:52:00.659
TALIESIN: 22.

00:52:00.659 --> 00:52:03.411
MATT: 22 hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

00:52:03.411 --> 00:52:05.476
TRAVIS: Oh shit. We're all going to go deaf.

00:52:05.476 --> 00:52:09.811
LAURA: Oh man, that's going to be loud as fuck.

00:52:09.811 --> 00:52:17.655
TALIESIN: 19.

00:52:17.655 --> 00:52:26.894
MATT: 19. (gunshot) Bad News goes off. The sound
is deafening in the room, the echoing of the

00:52:26.894 --> 00:52:31.835
explosion through the stone walls. I'm going to go
ahead and have you roll a constitution saving

00:52:31.835 --> 00:52:32.644
throw.

00:52:32.644 --> 00:52:33.740
LIAM: Vax or Liam?

00:52:33.740 --> 00:52:35.247
MATT: Vax. Both, maybe.

00:52:35.247 --> 00:52:36.491
LIAM: Roll a what now?

00:52:36.491 --> 00:52:37.705
MATT: Constitution saving throw.

00:52:37.705 --> 00:52:39.869
TALIESIN: If you fail, I get to scream in your
ear.

00:52:39.869 --> 00:52:41.474
LIAM: That is a 15.

00:52:41.474 --> 00:52:48.195
MATT: 15, okay. You don't go deaf, but your ears
are ringing very hard. The entity screams and then

00:52:48.195 --> 00:52:49.706
disperses.

00:52:49.706 --> 00:52:52.665
TALIESIN: I get a grit point back.

00:52:52.665 --> 00:52:56.188
MARISHA: You do! Dope.

00:52:56.188 --> 00:53:01.393
MATT: Okay, so two more attacks. Or you have to
use one to reload.

00:53:01.393 --> 00:53:06.276
TALIESIN: I have to use one to reload. I have one
more attack, but I've already-- I didn't move. I'm

00:53:06.276 --> 00:53:25.798
going to try and roll around the corner and I'm
going to take another shot. 27.

00:53:25.798 --> 00:53:31.022
MATT: 27 hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

00:53:31.022 --> 00:53:33.816
TALIESIN: 19 points of damage.

00:53:33.816 --> 00:53:40.407
MATT: Okay. This time (gunshot), the shot goes off
right by your head, Tiberius. You're flying in the

00:53:40.407 --> 00:53:43.410
air and you look down and see him pull Bad News
out right beneath you, and before you have a

00:53:43.410 --> 00:53:50.161
chance to react, (gunshot) the flash of the muzzle
just bursting forward, a big plume of black powder

00:53:50.161 --> 00:53:52.787
smoke fills the air around you.

00:53:52.787 --> 00:53:56.271
ORION: So I see a big flash? And what do I roll?

00:53:56.271 --> 00:53:58.358
MATT: Make a constitution saving throw.

00:53:58.358 --> 00:53:59.742
TALIESIN: Sorry.

00:53:59.742 --> 00:54:01.218
ORION: Seven.

00:54:01.218 --> 00:54:04.496
MATT: Okay, you are considered deaf until the
start of his next turn.

00:54:04.496 --> 00:54:09.194
ORION: Okay, so as soon as I see the flash, I go,
(yelps). That's all I do.

00:54:09.194 --> 00:54:12.991
(laughter)

00:54:12.991 --> 00:54:18.742
MATT: So that ends your turn, Percy? All right.
Next, this entity that's Hunter's Marked is going to

00:54:18.742 --> 00:54:30.999
rush forward, straight out of the grapple from
Jarett. Shifts right out of his hands. Is going to

00:54:30.999 --> 00:54:40.104
run forward and take the double attack against the
prisoner. That's a 19 plus six. 25 hits. And 15

00:54:40.104 --> 00:54:49.776
hits, as well. Takes 30 points of damage. Is
currently unconscious. Punches him twice, and you

00:54:49.776 --> 00:54:54.086
see the poor driver is knocked up into the
ceiling, falls down onto the bed, and is

00:54:54.086 --> 00:54:58.567
half-laying off. You see blood trickling down the
front of his face, his eyes open, and slowly

00:54:58.567 --> 00:54:59.901
close.

00:54:59.901 --> 00:55:01.613
MARISHA: We need him alive.

00:55:01.613 --> 00:55:03.991
MATT: That brings us to Trinket's turn.

00:55:03.991 --> 00:55:05.995
MARISHA: Come on, Trinket!

00:55:05.995 --> 00:55:09.229
LAURA: Trinket roars, rushes forward.

00:55:09.229 --> 00:55:15.098
MATT: Actually, we're now going to roll Trinket
into your turn.

00:55:15.098 --> 00:55:17.335
LAURA: Oh, all right. Then he stays there.

00:55:17.335 --> 00:55:23.059
MATT: Okay. Trinket stays there until it's your
turn. Jarett is going to rush forward and come to

00:55:23.059 --> 00:55:28.862
this corner. The crossbow is not much aid at this
point. Reaches over and pulls out a short sword

00:55:28.862 --> 00:55:39.805
and lunges forward with the short sword. Yeah,
with disadvantage, nine. Oh god. Rolls a 20 and a

00:55:39.805 --> 00:55:45.484
three. Great. Sorry, Jarett. Swinging through,
trying to pierce through the bars at this entity,

00:55:45.484 --> 00:55:49.526
and can't seem to get any sort of attack to hit.

00:55:49.526 --> 00:55:52.716
LAURA: So he's actually locked in the thing
still?

00:55:52.716 --> 00:55:56.446
MATT: Jarett got the door open, he came through to
try and grab the creature, and as he tried to pull

00:55:56.446 --> 00:56:01.465
it back, the creature sifted through his hands
again to go ahead and attack the prisoner. That

00:56:01.465 --> 00:56:03.726
ends Jarett's turn. Vex, it is now your turn.

00:56:03.726 --> 00:56:06.921
LAURA: Okay. Can I move forward so I can see?

00:56:06.921 --> 00:56:10.075
MATT: Yeah, you can see about there; it would give
you visual on the entity.

00:56:10.075 --> 00:56:16.984
LAURA: All right. Yeah, I'll do that. I'll shoot
him. He's Hunter's Marked already, okay, good.

00:56:16.984 --> 00:56:19.479
MATT: He is, yes. So both attacks at
disadvantage.

00:56:19.479 --> 00:56:24.767
LAURA: 15.

00:56:24.767 --> 00:56:27.337
MATT: 15 hits. Just hits.

00:56:27.337 --> 00:56:39.277
LAURA: 16.

00:56:39.277 --> 00:56:44.173
MATT: 16 also hits-- oh, 16 damage. All right.
Including the additional Hunter's Mark?

00:56:44.173 --> 00:56:47.848
LAURA: Yes. And then 14 doesn't hit.

00:56:47.848 --> 00:56:53.355
MATT: 14 does not hit. The arrow disappears in the
back of the cell, scattering and shattering

00:56:53.355 --> 00:56:55.104
against part of the stone wall.

00:56:55.104 --> 00:57:00.217
LAURA: And Trinket, can he get up to him? Oh, but
I took all the attacks.

00:57:00.217 --> 00:57:02.704
MATT: Correct. So Trinket rushes up, but doesn't
attack.

00:57:02.704 --> 00:57:04.896
LAURA: Trinket stays in the corner, then, because
he can't do shit.

00:57:04.896 --> 00:57:11.600
MATT: Okay. Trinket just cheers you on. (bear
growl) Cool, that ends your turn. Keyleth.

00:57:11.600 --> 00:57:17.759
MARISHA: Okay, I'm going to-- seeing the direction
that everyone's pointing, going to walk up and

00:57:17.759 --> 00:57:26.404
reach around Vex and I'm going to cast Faerie Fire
right-- oh god, wrong direction. Right in the

00:57:26.404 --> 00:57:27.560
fucking eye.

00:57:27.560 --> 00:57:30.617
(laughter)

00:57:30.617 --> 00:57:33.378
LIAM: You turn on yourself.

00:57:33.378 --> 00:57:39.137
MARISHA: Crit fail. It's a 20-foot cube, so I want
to cast it right in the cell.

00:57:39.137 --> 00:57:49.337
MATT: Okay. So as you cast that, it's going to
attempt to make its save. What's the DC on that?

00:57:49.337 --> 00:57:54.214
MARISHA: Against my spell's DC? 18.

00:57:54.214 --> 00:57:59.665
MATT: And it fails with a 14. All right, so you
guys watch as she reaches her hand out. The entire

00:57:59.665 --> 00:58:04.192
cell, all of a sudden there's a burst of purplish
light, and these little dust-stars of purple

00:58:04.192 --> 00:58:09.248
glowing begin to drift down from the ceiling. As
they do, they cling to whatever this form is, and

00:58:09.248 --> 00:58:13.498
you can now see, very clearly, this invisible
entity that is surrounded in these purple

00:58:13.498 --> 00:58:19.461
sparkles. It looks humanoid from the torso up, but
its legs are shimmering and shifting around. You

00:58:19.461 --> 00:58:22.472
now have a very clear look on it. You've nullified
its invisibility.

00:58:22.472 --> 00:58:24.989
MARISHA: You have advantage now.

00:58:24.989 --> 00:58:29.307
MATT: Gives advantage, as well? Yeah. You guys now
all have advantage on this entity.

00:58:29.307 --> 00:58:36.725
MARISHA: And I'm going to take my bonus action to
do Healing Word on the-- it's not Jarett that's

00:58:36.725 --> 00:58:40.393
unconscious, it's the cab driver. On the cab
driver.

00:58:40.393 --> 00:58:43.411
MATT: Okay, so go ahead and roll for the Healing
Word.

00:58:43.411 --> 00:58:50.939
SAM: Desmond. Jarett and Desmond.

00:58:50.939 --> 00:58:53.858
MATT: How much does he heal?

00:58:53.858 --> 00:59:08.871
MARISHA: Six plus my spell modifier. So ten? Is
that right, is that how it works? Plus my spell

00:59:08.871 --> 00:59:11.058
level? Is that what it is with Healing Word?

00:59:11.058 --> 00:59:15.622
MATT: I think it's plus five, whatever it is.
Healing Word, yeah.

00:59:15.622 --> 00:59:17.544
MARISHA: 1d4 plus my spellcasting ability
modifier.

00:59:17.544 --> 00:59:19.071
MATT: So it's plus six.

00:59:19.071 --> 00:59:20.947
MARISHA: Six, so 12.

00:59:20.947 --> 00:59:26.157
MATT: 12. Got you. Okay. Desmond's eyes clarify
for a second and he begins to breathe heavily.

00:59:26.157 --> 00:59:30.251
Still looking very wounded, but conscious and
prone across the bed, as the entity that's

00:59:30.251 --> 00:59:33.571
Hunter's Marked is still looming over it, bringing
its fists up for another round to try and finish

00:59:33.571 --> 00:59:36.707
its job. That ends your turn, Keyleth. Grog,
you're up.

00:59:36.707 --> 00:59:42.466
TRAVIS: There you are. Hold still, Casper! And I
run up and I swing.

00:59:42.466 --> 00:59:45.190
(laughter)

00:59:45.190 --> 00:59:48.185
MATT: As you rush up angrily, make your strike.

00:59:48.185 --> 00:59:51.737
TRAVIS: That's 28.

00:59:51.737 --> 00:59:53.297
MATT: That hits.

00:59:53.297 --> 00:59:57.737
TRAVIS: That's a 27.

00:59:57.737 --> 00:59:59.005
MATT: Hits.

00:59:59.005 --> 01:00:00.548
LIAM: Those would hit Tiamat.

01:00:00.548 --> 01:00:03.643
TRAVIS: 17.

01:00:03.643 --> 01:00:08.268
MATT: 17 also hits, so roll damage three times. As
you rush up, the bars open, bringing the axe down

01:00:08.268 --> 01:00:10.524
on top of this now sparkling purple entity.

01:00:10.524 --> 01:00:15.681
TRAVIS: Ten, so 14 on the first one, plus fire
damage.

01:00:15.681 --> 01:00:17.247
MATT: Cool.

01:00:17.247 --> 01:00:27.206
TRAVIS: 17 plus-- 21. No. Is that right? Did I do
that right?

01:00:27.206 --> 01:00:28.362
LAURA: Yeah?

01:00:28.362 --> 01:00:30.815
TRAVIS: Yeah. So 21. The second one.

01:00:30.815 --> 01:00:32.075
MATT: Okay.

01:00:32.075 --> 01:00:37.013
TRAVIS: And 17, 21 again!

01:00:37.013 --> 01:00:45.891
MATT: Nice! All righty, so you run up (hammer
strikes) hammer down a third time, you can see its

01:00:45.952 --> 01:00:50.986
body being beaten around by the attack. And you
see the whispering of its wind around its lower

01:00:50.986 --> 01:00:53.929
body is starting to slow, and it's looking like
it's getting more sluggish, but it's definitely

01:00:53.929 --> 01:00:57.830
still intent on its job. That ends your turn,
Grog. Vax, you're up.

01:00:57.830 --> 01:01:02.904
LIAM: All right, in a split second I'm watching
Grog take the thing apart. I size up everybody in

01:01:02.904 --> 01:01:07.751
front of me in the distance and I think I can
Assassin Creed my way through the crowd because I

01:01:07.751 --> 01:01:13.240
can go 60 feet normally, so 30 feet if it's
crowded, and I'm going to use Grog's proximity to

01:01:13.240 --> 01:01:15.008
take this thing apart.

01:01:15.008 --> 01:01:17.890
MATT: Okay. I will say you would normally get
advantage. Because you're attacking it through the

01:01:17.890 --> 01:01:22.320
bars, melee, it disables it, so it's just a
straight attack. You're having to fight it through

01:01:22.320 --> 01:01:24.533
prison bars with daggers, which is difficult.

01:01:24.533 --> 01:01:27.331
LIAM: All right. So the first one is terrible,
it's a 14.

01:01:27.331 --> 01:01:29.023
MATT: 14 misses, unfortunately.

01:01:29.023 --> 01:01:31.392
LIAM: And that's where the sneak attack damage is,
right?

01:01:31.392 --> 01:01:34.806
MATT: Well, it's the first attack you get on it
would get it. So even if you miss the first

01:01:34.806 --> 01:01:36.836
attack, you can still get it with the second and
third.

01:01:36.836 --> 01:01:39.797
LIAM: All right. Third one is a 21.

01:01:39.797 --> 01:01:40.795
MATT: That does hit.

01:01:40.795 --> 01:01:58.076
LIAM: So there's the delivery system, and that is
the Keen Dagger. 26, 27, 32. 38.

01:01:58.076 --> 01:02:04.180
MATT: All right. With that, the first blade comes
through and you try and get it through the bars

01:02:04.180 --> 01:02:08.383
and it gets nothing. You pull back, take the other
dagger and swing through it. Falls too wide and

01:02:08.383 --> 01:02:11.646
you have to bring your arm back. This time, you
can see after Grog has slammed it with the hammer,

01:02:11.646 --> 01:02:17.203
it falls. The sparkles come towards the edge.
Its slamming its back into the bars. It's right

01:02:17.203 --> 01:02:19.979
there in front of you, and you use that instance
to go ahead and reach through the bars, grab it by

01:02:19.979 --> 01:02:28.530
the throat, and stab it repeatedly, at which point
its form disperses into wind around you.

01:02:28.530 --> 01:02:36.806
LIAM: And I slap Grog on the back and say, you
softened the shit of him. That's terrible

01:02:36.806 --> 01:02:39.860
English. You softened him up for me! Asshole.

01:02:39.860 --> 01:02:41.425
TRAVIS: You've been drinking?

01:02:41.425 --> 01:02:45.835
LAURA: (giggling) You softened the shit of him.

01:02:45.835 --> 01:02:49.124
LIAM: You shitted him up for me, Grog. Good job.

01:02:49.124 --> 01:02:56.100
MATT: You guys look over. You see Desmond is still
on the bed, eyes wide (panting).

01:02:56.100 --> 01:03:03.343
ORION: I rush over to Desmond, and out of my pouch
I bring out a sandwich that I had made earlier. I

01:03:03.343 --> 01:03:08.564
hand it to him and I go, Desmond, decker. Here,
have it. It's a decker sandwich. You should have

01:03:08.564 --> 01:03:09.541
it.

01:03:09.541 --> 01:03:13.713
MATT: Gets up on the bed and takes it. "What
happened?"

01:03:13.713 --> 01:03:16.282
LAURA: I run up and I cast Cure Wounds on him.

01:03:16.282 --> 01:03:18.890
MATT: Okay. So go ahead and roll for the Cure
Wounds heal on that.

01:03:18.890 --> 01:03:21.102
TRAVIS: You casting that all over the place now
aren't you, fancy-pants?

01:03:21.102 --> 01:03:28.651
SAM: From the tinkering room I yell out, is it
safe? Can I come out now?

01:03:28.651 --> 01:03:30.607
ORION: It's safe.

01:03:30.607 --> 01:03:32.485
LIAM: There's four more of them. Stay back.

01:03:32.485 --> 01:03:34.300
SAM: Oh! Okay. I'll stay.

01:03:34.300 --> 01:03:38.369
TRAVIS: I remember I have the holy oil in my hand,
mixed with the blood, and I start blessing him. With

01:03:38.369 --> 01:03:42.178
bloody fist.

01:03:42.178 --> 01:03:43.445
LAURA: 17.

01:03:43.445 --> 01:03:44.709
MATT: All right, awesome.

01:03:44.709 --> 01:03:47.294
LAURA: Do I add my wisdom to that?

01:03:47.294 --> 01:03:49.219
MATT: You add your wisdom modifier.

01:03:49.219 --> 01:03:51.550
LAURA: Then it's 20.

01:03:51.550 --> 01:03:55.467
MATT: That's good to know. All right, cool. All
right.

01:03:55.467 --> 01:03:56.911
ORION: How's that sandwich?

01:03:56.911 --> 01:04:02.622
MATT: Desmond isn't eating it. He's just holding
it and still taking in. "What happened? What was

01:04:02.622 --> 01:04:04.928
"that?! Look, what was that thing?"

01:04:04.928 --> 01:04:07.804
TRAVIS: Yeah, what was that thing?

01:04:07.804 --> 01:04:09.230
LAURA: What was that thing?

01:04:09.230 --> 01:04:10.945
ORION: I would say opaque buttholes.

01:04:10.945 --> 01:04:13.063
MARISHA: Can we do a check?

01:04:13.063 --> 01:04:14.611
MATT: Make an arcana check.

01:04:14.611 --> 01:04:16.955
TALIESIN: I'll make an arcana check, too.

01:04:16.955 --> 01:04:18.914
SAM: How did you get two?

01:04:18.914 --> 01:04:20.771
ORION: I rolled one by accident.

01:04:20.771 --> 01:04:28.527
MATT: If you rolled by accident, you have to roll
intentionally to take the score. Because if you

01:04:28.527 --> 01:04:31.758
were to accidentally roll really bad, you'd be
like, "That doesn't count! I didn't actually

01:04:31.758 --> 01:04:33.004
"roll."

01:04:33.004 --> 01:04:34.616
ORION: A hard 12.

01:04:34.616 --> 01:04:35.839
MATT: Total of 12?

01:04:35.839 --> 01:04:37.764
LIAM: I rolled a 22 arcana check.

01:04:37.764 --> 01:04:39.135
MARISHA: 22?

01:04:39.135 --> 01:04:42.460
LAURA: Oh, he's faced these things before. That's
what it is.

01:04:42.460 --> 01:04:48.298
MATT: That's the thing, you've seen these. These
entities are used by certain high-level arcane

01:04:48.298 --> 01:04:54.309
practitioners. They can be summoned as certain
spells. They're air elemental-based in nature, but

01:04:54.309 --> 01:05:03.328
they're generally known as invisible stalkers.
They're used as assassins that have a very sole,

01:05:03.328 --> 01:05:04.445
single-minded purpose.

01:05:04.445 --> 01:05:07.228
LIAM: All I know is they feel like the
Briarwoods.

01:05:07.228 --> 01:05:11.047
MATT: You get that, based on recent events,
there's probably a good probability that was the

01:05:11.047 --> 01:05:12.349
source of this.

01:05:12.349 --> 01:05:17.358
LAURA: Do you know from your previous experience
if there's any way to protect against them? Other

01:05:17.358 --> 01:05:18.976
than setting up walls?

01:05:18.976 --> 01:05:23.138
LIAM: Well, all I know is how to stick my face in
the beehives, apparently.

01:05:23.138 --> 01:05:28.203
LAURA: Does anybody know how to protect against
air stalkers?

01:05:28.203 --> 01:05:30.051
ORION: Give me a day, I will find out.

01:05:30.051 --> 01:05:37.111
MATT: Jarett, at which point has put his hand
against the wall, and goes, "Ugh. I would

01:05:37.111 --> 01:05:41.356
"recommend that next time you decide to put me on
watch, let me know if we're up against things that

01:05:41.356 --> 01:05:45.654
"are invisible. I apologize. I was not prepared for
such a foe to show up."

01:05:45.654 --> 01:05:49.095
LAURA: We were unprepared to warn you. I'm sorry.

01:05:49.095 --> 01:05:54.837
MATT: "It's all right. If I might ask, what
exactly are we up against here?"

01:05:54.837 --> 01:05:56.225
TRAVIS: Fuck if we know.

01:05:56.225 --> 01:06:03.094
ORION: Seems like we're up against either vampires
or liches. Prepare the troops. There will be some

01:06:03.094 --> 01:06:07.568
changes made to the keep over the next couple of
days. We shall shore up security, as well.

01:06:07.568 --> 01:06:12.904
MATT: "I would like also to consider possibly some
changes made to our income, as this suddenly

01:06:12.904 --> 01:06:17.839
"turned from a general guarding job to going up
against the denizens of the afterlife. It's

01:06:17.839 --> 01:06:20.874
"already been a very dangerous proposition."

01:06:20.874 --> 01:06:24.147
ORION: Of course. We shall discuss that in the--
is it the morning?

01:06:24.147 --> 01:06:28.038
MATT: "Very well. I'm going to go ahead and make
sure the rest of my team is alive."

01:06:28.038 --> 01:06:30.278
LIAM: Jarett! Are you up for it?

01:06:30.278 --> 01:06:32.473
MATT: "If the pay is good, yes."

01:06:32.473 --> 01:06:35.267
LAURA: Jarett's up for anything.

01:06:35.267 --> 01:06:42.230
MATT: "You understand. Ugh, okay. Talk to you in
the morning. I think a bit of rest is necessary."

01:06:42.230 --> 01:06:47.705
And he makes his way up the stairs to the rest of
the keep. Desmond at this point is still in shock,

01:06:47.705 --> 01:06:50.301
and he starts absentmindedly eating the sandwich
that you handed him.

01:06:50.301 --> 01:06:53.972
ORION: It's good, right? I had one yesterday.

01:06:53.972 --> 01:06:57.939
LAURA: Well. Maybe it's best not to leave him down
here.

01:06:57.939 --> 01:07:01.367
ORION: No. You should stay in the guest room.
Come.

01:07:01.367 --> 01:07:03.728
MATT: "Is it safer there?"

01:07:03.728 --> 01:07:05.239
ORION: Yes, it is.

01:07:05.239 --> 01:07:07.958
MATT: "I told you they'd come for me. I told you
they would."

01:07:07.958 --> 01:07:11.650
LAURA: But you know what! You're still alive.

01:07:11.650 --> 01:07:14.950
SAM: You've had the worst couple of days.

01:07:14.950 --> 01:07:18.961
MATT: Wipes the blood from the side of his face
and looks at it.

01:07:18.961 --> 01:07:34.762
ORION: Let's take you upstairs and get you all
fitted... Who do we talk to that works for us that

01:07:34.762 --> 01:07:37.732
does the actual construction to the keep?

01:07:37.732 --> 01:07:44.484
LAURA: That is one of Uriel's staff. In which
case, we cannot talk to them right now.

01:07:44.484 --> 01:07:50.535
MATT: Yeah, the individual responsible for the
construction of the keep was Lord Riskel Daxio,

01:07:50.535 --> 01:07:55.455
which is an elven gentleman on the Council that
helped oversee the whole construction and helped

01:07:55.455 --> 01:07:57.162
you guys design it, so.

01:07:57.162 --> 01:07:58.941
LIAM: Is he still on the bed?

01:07:58.941 --> 01:08:00.156
MATT: Still on the bed.

01:08:00.156 --> 01:08:06.248
LIAM: I sit down next to him and say, listen. You
are a victim of circumstance, we understand that.

01:08:06.248 --> 01:08:13.485
We are, to a certain degree, as well. We're not
leaving your side, and really there's no other

01:08:13.485 --> 01:08:19.591
choice. I mean, you're fucked like we are. So we
will do our best to protect you, I promise you.

01:08:19.591 --> 01:08:23.277
MATT: "Okay."

01:08:23.277 --> 01:08:27.132
TRAVIS: I volunteer to sleep down in the room.

01:08:27.132 --> 01:08:28.691
LIAM: Oh wow.

01:08:28.691 --> 01:08:30.285
ORION: He shall stay in my quarters.

01:08:30.285 --> 01:08:32.553
TRAVIS: It's better down here, isn't it?

01:08:32.553 --> 01:08:36.572
LIAM: In a locked cell with Grog? I think is
pretty safe.

01:08:36.572 --> 01:08:40.892
LAURA: I think it's probably better to bring him
upstairs, because if it's locked, we can't get to

01:08:40.892 --> 01:08:42.519
him very quickly.

01:08:42.519 --> 01:08:47.278
ORION: Don't worry, we can enchant his room, as
well, to have an alert thing go on if anything

01:08:47.278 --> 01:08:52.280
happens in the room at night, and it would be
safer. I shall be sleeping in my laboratory for

01:08:52.280 --> 01:08:54.066
the next several nights, as well.

01:08:54.066 --> 01:09:02.525
MARISHA: I mean, I can still go ahead and do the
planar bindings to an elemental that maybe I

01:09:02.525 --> 01:09:07.848
should've done beforehand. It lasts 30 days.

01:09:07.848 --> 01:09:12.540
LIAM: I like all of these things, but I think Grog
as a bunkmate is a good idea.

01:09:12.540 --> 01:09:18.250
MATT: At this point, Desmond leans into you and
quietly says in your ear, Vax, he goes, "Is where

01:09:18.250 --> 01:09:23.007
"I'm sleeping going to be away from him?" He looks
over towards Percy.

01:09:23.007 --> 01:09:26.714
TRAVIS: Yeah, totally away from him.

01:09:26.714 --> 01:09:31.089
MARISHA: It's fine. You'll have him in between you
and him.

01:09:31.089 --> 01:09:33.643
MATT: You don't hear that; it's whispered to Vax.

01:09:33.643 --> 01:09:44.730
LIAM: There is a lot of history for Percy wrapped
up in this and he has done you wrong, no question.

01:09:44.730 --> 01:09:54.420
But the answer is yes. You will be separate from
Percival. You will be protected. And you have my

01:09:54.420 --> 01:09:55.726
word.

01:09:55.726 --> 01:09:57.844
MATT: Make a persuasion roll.

01:09:57.844 --> 01:09:59.684
LAURA: And you have my axe!

01:09:59.684 --> 01:10:07.190
LIAM: I'm going to use some Luck. Using my Luck.
Natural 20, with Luck.

01:10:07.190 --> 01:10:11.752
MATT: Takes another bite of the sandwich and packs
it away in a little piece of cloth he had in a

01:10:11.752 --> 01:10:15.126
pocket, puts it in there. And you know, you can
still see as he brings his hand up, you can see the

01:10:15.126 --> 01:10:19.722
blood streak against where the fingers were on the
lower half of that hand. Strokes the edge of his

01:10:19.722 --> 01:10:27.728
chin and goes, "Okay. I trust you. Please. Please
don't let them kill me."

01:10:27.728 --> 01:10:32.023
LIAM: We may be fuck-ups--

01:10:32.023 --> 01:10:34.201
ORION: Speak for yourself.

01:10:34.201 --> 01:10:40.085
LIAM: But we're not without ability. You have my
word. I promise you.

01:10:40.085 --> 01:10:44.554
MATT: "Okay. I'm very tired."

01:10:44.554 --> 01:10:51.732
LAURA: Desmond, dear. Let's go upstairs. Grog!
That bed needs to go back up to the guest room.

01:10:51.732 --> 01:10:57.162
TRAVIS: Fucking hell. I start to take the fucking
bed up the stairs.

01:10:57.162 --> 01:11:01.310
MATT: Takes you roughly another 20 minutes or so
to bring it out of there, fitting it through the

01:11:01.310 --> 01:11:02.700
door.

01:11:02.700 --> 01:11:05.243
ORION: Erwen! Where is that old man?

01:11:05.243 --> 01:11:13.192
MATT: As you call out, Erwen eventually comes
down. "Hi. Yes, Tiberius. You called? It's quite

01:11:13.192 --> 01:11:15.999
"early in the morning." He has his night cap on and
he's rubbing at his eyes.

01:11:15.999 --> 01:11:17.344
MARISHA: What time is it?

01:11:17.344 --> 01:11:21.593
MATT: Right now, it's about probably 6:30 in the
morning or so. It's just after sunrise; you guys

01:11:21.593 --> 01:11:23.137
haven't even slept yet.

01:11:23.137 --> 01:11:29.065
ORION: Oh. Shit. Never mind, I'll talk to you once
we've slept. Go back to sleep. I didn't realize

01:11:29.065 --> 01:11:33.220
what time it was! I thought it was 10:00 AM, which
is totally different than 6:00 AM. I didn't know

01:11:33.220 --> 01:11:34.270
that.

01:11:34.270 --> 01:11:40.593
MATT: "It's all right. All right. In the morning
then, Master Tiberius." And he goes off to his bed

01:11:40.593 --> 01:11:41.862
to sleep.

01:11:41.862 --> 01:11:43.170
TRAVIS: We go to sleep?

01:11:43.170 --> 01:11:44.956
LAURA: Yeah, we need to sleep.

01:11:44.956 --> 01:11:52.861
SAM: I gently fall asleep under Percy's workbench,
where I've been hiding this whole time.

01:11:52.861 --> 01:11:54.926
MATT: Okay, make a stealth check.

01:11:54.926 --> 01:11:56.435
TALIESIN: Not going to sleep down there.

01:11:56.435 --> 01:11:58.766
SAM: Natural 20.

01:11:58.766 --> 01:12:03.151
MATT: All right, so. As the rest of you go to
sleep--

01:12:03.151 --> 01:12:06.360
TALIESIN: I'm going to go into my workshop.

01:12:06.360 --> 01:12:13.469
LIAM: On my way up, I fall in next to Keyleth.
Ask, is your hand all right?

01:12:13.469 --> 01:12:15.105
MARISHA: It's fine.

01:12:15.105 --> 01:12:16.747
LIAM: Do you need anything?

01:12:16.747 --> 01:12:18.168
MARISHA: Nope.

01:12:18.168 --> 01:12:24.843
TRAVIS: Since he's sleeping in the room with me, I
take a few of the caltrops that I have and I put

01:12:24.843 --> 01:12:27.747
them on the inside of the doorway before I close
it.

01:12:27.747 --> 01:12:31.150
MATT: Okay. So you guys are doing your setup
there. Percy, you're in your workshop. Go ahead and

01:12:31.150 --> 01:12:35.885
roll a perception check, Percy.

01:12:35.885 --> 01:12:37.201
TALIESIN: 17.

01:12:37.201 --> 01:12:39.744
MATT: 17. Okay. You go about your work.

01:12:39.744 --> 01:12:41.394
TALIESIN: I'm fixing my gun.

01:12:41.394 --> 01:12:48.487
MATT: Okay. The materials that it requires you to
do so are expensive, you actually have to pay the

01:12:48.487 --> 01:12:50.934
cost of the gun, and go ahead and make another
check.

01:12:50.934 --> 01:12:52.541
SAM: The fuck is that sound?

01:12:52.541 --> 01:12:58.928
MATT: So go ahead and make another tinkering check. And
the cost of the Pepperbox should be at the bottom

01:12:58.928 --> 01:13:00.027
of your--

01:13:00.027 --> 01:13:02.211
TALIESIN: Is it the whole cost or half?

01:13:02.211 --> 01:13:06.817
MATT: Should be half the cost. It should say under
the repair rules for a misfire.

01:13:06.817 --> 01:13:15.077
TALIESIN: Half cost. Oh my god, that's awful.
Okay, tinkering check. 12.

01:13:15.077 --> 01:13:16.695
MATT: 12. Okay.

01:13:16.695 --> 01:13:18.609
TALIESIN: Technically, that would be a success.

01:13:18.609 --> 01:13:24.562
MATT: Yeah. So you take the rest of the morning,
unsleeping, the dark bags under your eyes. You

01:13:24.562 --> 01:13:26.051
manage to get the Pepperbox back in working
order.

01:13:26.051 --> 01:13:28.527
TALIESIN: Oh, I was asleep. I wasn't with them, so
I just woke up really early.

01:13:28.527 --> 01:13:34.203
MATT: Right, right. But even so, even though you
slept, it hasn't been very restful. It's been

01:13:34.203 --> 01:13:40.455
technically enough to rest, but your evening has
been fraught with nightmares. Perpetually. But

01:13:40.455 --> 01:13:43.816
your Pepperbox is repaired, and does cost you half
the cost of the weapon cost to repair.

01:13:43.816 --> 01:13:45.392
TALIESIN: 75 gold.

01:13:45.392 --> 01:13:48.263
ORION: I sleep in my little nook in my
laboratory.

01:13:48.263 --> 01:13:55.020
MATT: Okay. You guys rest through the rest of the
morning, waking up past noon, probably about 2:00

01:13:55.020 --> 01:14:02.057
in the afternoon. You all gradually begin to come to
consciousness. Make your way downstairs. As you

01:14:02.057 --> 01:14:12.037
come downstairs, you can already smell breakfast
has been prepared. You can see Laina already has

01:14:12.037 --> 01:14:15.871
the meal set out for you, and as you guys
approach, "Oh it's so nice of all of you to come

01:14:15.871 --> 01:14:20.785
"down! It was very interesting. These very nice
folks came by this morning and dropped off a whole

01:14:20.785 --> 01:14:28.976
"bunch of food and fresh veggies and stuff. Makes
for a great meal. It was very nice of them. Food

01:14:28.976 --> 01:14:32.670
"is served." And she&nbsp;gives out the plates and
gives you a smile.

01:14:32.670 --> 01:14:35.068
TRAVIS: I love you. (eating noises)

01:14:35.068 --> 01:14:36.819
LIAM: Is this a frittata?

01:14:36.819 --> 01:14:40.251
MATT: "I believe that's what it's called in some
circles. I'm trying a few new things!"

01:14:40.251 --> 01:14:42.121
TRAVIS: Can I make a beard check?

01:14:42.121 --> 01:14:46.350
ORION: I'm going to take some food and feed it to
Lockheed and roll for my animal handling for the

01:14:46.350 --> 01:14:47.082
day.

01:14:47.082 --> 01:14:48.227
TRAVIS: 66.

01:14:48.227 --> 01:14:50.433
MATT: No effect, unfortunately.

01:14:50.433 --> 01:14:52.631
TRAVIS: Just a little tingle?

01:14:52.631 --> 01:14:57.901
MATT: There is a slight tingle, but it's mostly a
placebo.

01:14:57.901 --> 01:15:01.760
(laughter)

01:15:01.760 --> 01:15:08.201
MATT: As you guys are having your meals and you're
trying and you're feeding food, teaching this,

01:15:08.201 --> 01:15:10.485
everyone roll a perception check.

01:15:10.485 --> 01:15:12.562
LIAM: At home?

01:15:12.562 --> 01:15:17.068
ORION: 16!

01:15:17.068 --> 01:15:18.438
LIAM: I rolled a one.

01:15:18.438 --> 01:15:19.600
MARISHA: 17.

01:15:19.600 --> 01:15:21.129
LIAM: This frittata is lovely.

01:15:21.129 --> 01:15:22.914
SAM: Six.

01:15:22.914 --> 01:15:24.462
TRAVIS: Eight.

01:15:24.462 --> 01:15:26.557
LAURA: 16. But my passive is 21.

01:15:26.557 --> 01:15:35.863
MATT: Right, understood. Good to know. Percy's
down in his workshop. As you guys are in the

01:15:35.863 --> 01:15:42.114
middle of your meal, you hear, clearing the
stillness and quiet of the low munching-up,

01:15:42.114 --> 01:15:49.507
(clears throat) and sitting at the table adjacent
to you guys, completely unnoticed in his entry, is

01:15:49.507 --> 01:15:51.694
Seeker Asum, arms crossed.

01:15:51.694 --> 01:15:54.465
LAURA: Motherfucker, you are sneaky! I need to
talk to you.

01:15:54.465 --> 01:15:56.085
TRAVIS: We are not cool right now.

01:15:56.085 --> 01:16:00.520
MATT: "Well, obviously not. That's why I'm here to
have a conversation with the rest of you. Please

01:16:00.520 --> 01:16:02.497
"continue to eat. I don't mean to disturb you."

01:16:02.497 --> 01:16:03.864
ORION: Oh, very well.

01:16:03.864 --> 01:16:06.129
LAURA: Help yourself to a frittata.

01:16:06.129 --> 01:16:08.731
MATT: "I've already eaten, but I appreciate the
offer."

01:16:08.731 --> 01:16:10.921
ORION: Try this hakuna frittata. It's really
good!

01:16:10.921 --> 01:16:12.218
TRAVIS: Hakuna matata?

01:16:12.218 --> 01:16:14.077
LAURA: Let him talk.

01:16:14.077 --> 01:16:24.483
MATT: "What a wonderful meal. Well, things have
certainly gotten sticky, haven't they? Well, first

01:16:24.483 --> 01:16:30.632
"and foremost, I would like to thank you, Keyleth,
for clearing my head. Lord Briarwood had locked me

01:16:30.632 --> 01:16:35.739
"into some form of mental charm during my attempt
to aid Vax--"

01:16:35.739 --> 01:16:41.458
MARISHA: I told you it worked! Sorry, I'm a little
defensive right now. Continue.

01:16:41.458 --> 01:16:45.258
MATT: "That's all right. Things are a bit mixed
up. It's hard to explain; let's just say I have

01:16:45.258 --> 01:16:52.550
"been clouded in my judgment for the past few days
until you cleansed me. I'm sorry to uphold the

01:16:52.550 --> 01:16:54.806
"charade back in the palace."

01:16:54.806 --> 01:17:00.353
LIAM: Apologies are mine, I think. I believe you
had some sort of plan, and I thought I knew

01:17:00.353 --> 01:17:02.272
better, and for that I'm sorry.

01:17:02.272 --> 01:17:08.870
MATT: "I cannot say that is untrue. But I accept
your apology."

01:17:08.870 --> 01:17:10.948
LAURA: Can I roll for insight?

01:17:10.948 --> 01:17:12.525
MATT: You may.

01:17:12.525 --> 01:17:14.310
LIAM: Roll high!

01:17:14.310 --> 01:17:20.918
LAURA: I know! That was a shit roll. Nine.

01:17:20.918 --> 01:17:27.825
MATT: He's a hard person to gauge, anyway. You
gathered over time that most of his work deals in

01:17:27.825 --> 01:17:33.690
a network of spies and the gathering of
information across all of Tal'Dorei, so he is very

01:17:33.690 --> 01:17:38.884
well-trained to hide the essence of his true
nature and the intent. Hard to read. But he seems

01:17:38.884 --> 01:17:47.018
pleasant as he's been, and given the
circumstances. "Nevertheless, I accept your

01:17:47.018 --> 01:17:53.820
"apology, and I apologize for having upheld the
charade during the council meeting, but I had to

01:17:53.820 --> 01:17:59.347
"keep up appearances so as not to cause any sort of
stir at the time. I fear, based on my observations

01:17:59.347 --> 01:18:05.985
"since, that our very own sovereign also fell to
the same charm I did and has been clouded since

01:18:05.985 --> 01:18:07.818
"the dinner the night before."

01:18:07.818 --> 01:18:09.820
LAURA: Shit! That makes sense.

01:18:09.820 --> 01:18:11.342
MARISHA: We were afraid of that.

01:18:11.342 --> 01:18:13.252
SAM: He's fallen for that stuff before.

01:18:13.252 --> 01:18:18.028
MATT: "He's been through quite a bit, and while
he's a resolute and a very good man, I would say

01:18:18.028 --> 01:18:21.600
"that he is predisposed to outer influence from
those that are quite strong-willed."

01:18:21.600 --> 01:18:28.078
SAM: And this is why you kept up our accusations
against us in front of him?

01:18:28.078 --> 01:18:33.190
MATT: "Under those conditions, the room filled
with guards that were all intent against keeping

01:18:33.190 --> 01:18:37.218
"you at bay. Should you have made any attempt to
try and cleanse him as well during that time, I

01:18:37.218 --> 01:18:39.920
"think you all would have wound up in prison. Or
worse."

01:18:39.920 --> 01:18:45.501
MARISHA: So why didn't you want to show that you
were also cleansed? What was the point of holding

01:18:45.501 --> 01:18:46.905
up the charade?

01:18:46.905 --> 01:18:54.011
MATT: "Because when you're under this influence,
to speak against the proposed ally of the charm is

01:18:54.011 --> 01:18:58.645
"to draw a line. I wish to stay in his good graces
because that would enable us a much better chance

01:18:58.645 --> 01:19:02.962
"of getting you close enough to him to absolve him
of this charm. If I was to reveal this

01:19:02.962 --> 01:19:07.768
"instantaneously in the presence of the entire
council, I fear that might have put me in the same

01:19:07.768 --> 01:19:14.781
"court of disfavor as you and lost any future
chance of expelling this influence."

01:19:14.781 --> 01:19:18.480
LAURA: Do you it's only Uriel, or do you think
it's the rest of the council as well?

01:19:18.480 --> 01:19:28.951
MATT: "Best I can gather, most of the council is
not as well-- how do I put it? Not used to

01:19:28.951 --> 01:19:34.004
"business with Vox Machina. Allura seems to be of
clear mind, as she is very powerfully protected

01:19:34.004 --> 01:19:38.206
"against such influences and did not have any
immediate interaction with the Briarwoods during

01:19:38.206 --> 01:19:44.024
"that dinner. I fear the intent was on the
sovereign himself."

01:19:44.024 --> 01:19:51.059
SAM: Wait, are you saying that the Briarwoods
corrupted him?

01:19:51.059 --> 01:19:53.010
MATT: "Same way they corrupted me."

01:19:53.010 --> 01:19:55.141
SAM: During the dinner? While we were all sitting
there?

01:19:55.141 --> 01:19:57.348
MATT: "Apparently, it takes naught but a glance."

01:19:57.348 --> 01:20:00.250
LAURA: Oh shit! They could have gotten any of us.

01:20:00.250 --> 01:20:07.027
ORION: Yes. They did. Me. It was rather
inconvenient. I hate them. Sorry.

01:20:07.027 --> 01:20:09.150
MATT: "I think we have something in common."

01:20:09.150 --> 01:20:11.395
SAM: Aren't you deaf?

01:20:11.395 --> 01:20:13.493
LIAM: No, that was brief.

01:20:13.493 --> 01:20:15.790
ORION: I mean, what?

01:20:15.790 --> 01:20:19.215
SAM: Is that why you're talking so loud?

01:20:19.215 --> 01:20:21.013
ORION: Yes. I was getting it back.

01:20:21.013 --> 01:20:27.642
MATT: "There are a few options at our disposal.
You could continue to work to clear your name,

01:20:27.642 --> 01:20:33.118
"during his distraction southward, if you have some
idea as to how we could get close enough to him to

01:20:33.118 --> 01:20:38.118
"absolve him of this now, that would leave the risk
of, should anything go poorly, being poked with

01:20:38.118 --> 01:20:39.414
"many spear holes."

01:20:39.414 --> 01:20:45.665
LAURA: Is it possible to sneak into his room, and
restore him without anybody knowing?

01:20:45.665 --> 01:20:51.192
MATT: "If you're confident. That may be more of a
mission for the quieter of your bunch, should they

01:20:51.192 --> 01:20:54.879
"be a little more intelligent with their actions,
going forward."

01:20:54.879 --> 01:20:58.409
ORION: What about drawing him out to a luncheon or
whatnot?

01:20:58.409 --> 01:21:04.190
MATT: "I will say, based on recent circumstances,
he is very careful and defensive."

01:21:04.190 --> 01:21:10.920
LIAM: I have fair chances of getting in, but no
ability to cure him of any such thing.

01:21:10.920 --> 01:21:18.447
LAURA: What if Keyleth, who can do it, polymorphed
into a fly or a very small creature, traveled on

01:21:18.447 --> 01:21:23.356
you, you snuck in, she popped out, did the thing.
Money.

01:21:23.356 --> 01:21:30.099
SAM: (laughs) Unless they're caught, in which
case, you've got two of our members against the

01:21:30.099 --> 01:21:32.117
entire palace guard.

01:21:32.117 --> 01:21:35.913
LAURA: So then you go with them and Dimension Door
out.

01:21:35.913 --> 01:21:39.406
SAM: I didn't even want to face the little
invisible thing downstairs!

01:21:39.406 --> 01:21:43.558
ORION: Why don't we hold a special dinner?

01:21:43.558 --> 01:21:46.493
SAM: He hates our fucking guts.

01:21:46.493 --> 01:21:49.538
TRAVIS: Why don't we let Seeker Asum finish?

01:21:49.538 --> 01:21:55.410
SAM: Seeker Asum, in your opinion, is it safer to
try and heal him or to try and clear our name

01:21:55.410 --> 01:21:58.118
through the traditional legal means?

01:21:58.118 --> 01:22:06.924
MATT: "Honestly, I have no idea. I think this
plan, if successful, is quite inspired. However,

01:22:06.924 --> 01:22:14.736
"failure would probably end in the immediate
incarceration and/or death of both individuals

01:22:14.736 --> 01:22:22.390
"involved. Public execution does not befit the
country-wide name of Vox Machina, if you were to

01:22:22.390 --> 01:22:26.603
"fail. If you were to succeed, that would be the
most direct route between two points."

01:22:26.603 --> 01:22:30.917
MARISHA: So are we in agreement that we have to
clear Uriel's mind first?

01:22:30.917 --> 01:22:36.844
SAM: No. No, the other option is to clear our
names and not worry about clearing his mind.

01:22:36.844 --> 01:22:41.452
LAURA: Uriel, if he's got his mind controlled, it
doesn't matter if we try to clear our names, he's

01:22:41.452 --> 01:22:42.747
going to find us guilty.

01:22:42.747 --> 01:22:46.498
SAM: But during our trial, we will have a direct
line of sight to him, we might be able to get

01:22:46.498 --> 01:22:47.938
through to him.

01:22:47.938 --> 01:22:49.667
LIAM: Does he still trust Allura?

01:22:49.667 --> 01:22:51.527
MATT: "As far as I know, yes."

01:22:51.527 --> 01:22:55.421
TRAVIS: You know, if we kill the Briarwoods, is
this even a point?

01:22:55.421 --> 01:23:01.017
SAM: That's true. He doesn't trust Allura, she
wasn't even allowed in the room to talk to us.

01:23:01.017 --> 01:23:04.928
There's definitely suspicion there, right?

01:23:04.928 --> 01:23:07.789
LIAM: He did. He did question her allegiances.

01:23:07.789 --> 01:23:14.522
MATT: "If that's the case, then perhaps her
current power is not as strong in the council when

01:23:14.522 --> 01:23:19.922
"regarding you. But she is still a member of the
council, should she not be immediately affiliated

01:23:19.922 --> 01:23:28.462
"with you for her purposes. This is up to you.
Whatever you choose to do, if it requires my aid,

01:23:28.462 --> 01:23:36.233
"I will give it a day before I have to leave. My
next intent is to head-- well, I wish to go past

01:23:36.233 --> 01:23:41.478
"the eastern curtain set up by Whitestone into
Wildemount. I have spent the better part of the

01:23:41.478 --> 01:23:46.565
"past day since the cleansing seeking all records
of the Briarwoods and their doings. There was a

01:23:46.565 --> 01:23:51.803
"period of about eight years in which there is no
public record of their goings-on. It appears that

01:23:51.803 --> 01:23:56.528
"most records that deal with their involvement in
Wildemount, and whatever homestead gave them their

01:23:56.528 --> 01:24:01.580
"title, Lord and Lady Briarwood, has all been but
erased. So I intend to go to the source,

01:24:01.580 --> 01:24:04.864
"Wildemount itself, and research. This will take me
some time, of course."

01:24:04.864 --> 01:24:06.514
ORION: When do you plan on leaving?

01:24:06.514 --> 01:24:08.770
MATT: "Sooner the better. I was thinking
tomorrow."

01:24:08.770 --> 01:24:10.845
MARISHA: Is Percy here? Is Percy in the room?

01:24:10.845 --> 01:24:13.134
MATT: Percy is not even here. Percy is down in the
workshop.

01:24:13.134 --> 01:24:15.487
MARISHA: I go get Percy.

01:24:15.487 --> 01:24:16.645
MATT: Okay.

01:24:16.645 --> 01:24:19.469
TALIESIN: I was going to be at the door.

01:24:19.469 --> 01:24:23.059
MARISHA: Oh. I come around the corner, and I see
Percy.

01:24:23.059 --> 01:24:25.526
MATT: As you come around the corner, Percy is
currently leaning up against the side of the wall,

01:24:25.526 --> 01:24:27.585
listening in to the conversation.

01:24:27.585 --> 01:24:35.059
MARISHA: Hey! I was looking for you. You want to
come and actually join the conversation for once,

01:24:35.059 --> 01:24:39.673
instead of sitting outside the door and just
listening to them? Because I really feel like this

01:24:39.673 --> 01:24:44.371
is going to be your time to input and maybe
really help?

01:24:44.371 --> 01:24:47.361
TALIESIN: I don't feel like doing that. Oh. Lead
on.

01:24:47.361 --> 01:24:48.847
MARISHA: Okay.

01:24:48.847 --> 01:24:58.264
TRAVIS: Seeker Asum, we have managed to capture
and keep one of the coachmen. Down in our cell.

01:24:58.264 --> 01:25:05.095
Would he be safer in our hands, or within the
castle walls?

01:25:05.095 --> 01:25:06.713
MARISHA: Percy and I walk in.

01:25:06.713 --> 01:25:08.187
TRAVIS: I'm fucking asking.

01:25:08.187 --> 01:25:14.939
MATT: "Well, that depends. If you have strong
defenses, and the enemy has no means of entering,

01:25:14.939 --> 01:25:19.855
"then he will be safer here. The palace itself is a
very well-protected area; however, there currently

01:25:19.855 --> 01:25:31.149
"is an open invitation into the palace, and if the
essence of our enemy is as I think it is, then

01:25:31.149 --> 01:25:33.753
"they can enter whenever they like."

01:25:33.753 --> 01:25:35.502
TRAVIS: Never mind.

01:25:35.502 --> 01:25:40.968
LIAM: I think we're really choosing between two
paths here. Either we stay in town and tinker and

01:25:40.968 --> 01:25:45.476
gamble, or we're runaways.

01:25:45.476 --> 01:25:49.415
SAM: Runaways? No, we go to the Briarwoods--

01:25:49.415 --> 01:25:54.521
LIAM: That's what I'm talking about. The minute we
leave, we're outlaws. They've told us not to go.

01:25:54.521 --> 01:26:00.472
ORION: We can leave, we just cannot flee. We can
travel as we see fit. We just need to let them

01:26:00.472 --> 01:26:02.490
know where we're going.

01:26:02.490 --> 01:26:08.244
LIAM: Yeah, but we can't tell them 'we're going to
check out your associates'.

01:26:08.244 --> 01:26:10.015
TRAVIS: Yeah, we lie.

01:26:10.015 --> 01:26:12.865
MARISHA: Wait, what's the name of the town?

01:26:12.865 --> 01:26:14.334
SAM: Whitestone?

01:26:14.334 --> 01:26:19.295
MARISHA: Not Whitestone. Oh, I thought he was
saying he was going to go to their hometown.

01:26:19.295 --> 01:26:22.976
MATT: He's going to Wildemount, the kingdom that
they're originally from. The continent to the far

01:26:22.976 --> 01:26:24.111
east.

01:26:24.111 --> 01:26:33.071
MARISHA: He's not going to Whitestone. He's going
to go to Wildemount, which is on another

01:26:33.071 --> 01:26:37.941
continent. If we go to another continent, it
doesn't matter if we're fleeing or not. It's going

01:26:37.941 --> 01:26:39.427
to look like fleeing.

01:26:39.427 --> 01:26:41.288
TRAVIS: Why are you going to Wildemount, again?

01:26:41.288 --> 01:26:46.555
MATT: "I'm trying to find as much information to
incriminate them in case whatever you're

01:26:46.555 --> 01:26:48.333
"attempting does not work."

01:26:48.333 --> 01:26:55.080
ORION: Seeker, would you mind staying for a week
or so before your venture? We need time to

01:26:55.080 --> 01:27:00.707
convince the council to let us leave without
conflict and to procure particular items and

01:27:00.707 --> 01:27:04.061
things that we need. Very briefly. Would just take
some time.

01:27:04.061 --> 01:27:12.488
MATT: "I have already made arrangements for
travel. I could try, but depends on what you need

01:27:12.488 --> 01:27:14.019
"me here for."

01:27:14.019 --> 01:27:16.356
TRAVIS: What do we need him here for?

01:27:16.356 --> 01:27:19.731
ORION: Ultimately, protection or a good ear.

01:27:19.731 --> 01:27:27.260
MARISHA: Do you genuinely think they're going to
let us go with permission? We're not on their good

01:27:27.260 --> 01:27:28.187
side.

01:27:28.187 --> 01:27:30.491
LAURA: No, they're not. They're not going to let
us go.

01:27:30.491 --> 01:27:35.033
LIAM: We're going to be outlaws. We have to clear
ourselves by ending the charm on Uriel by

01:27:35.033 --> 01:27:37.426
finishing off Sylas.

01:27:37.426 --> 01:27:42.062
SAM: Or by killing the Briarwoods, thus ending the
charm.

01:27:42.062 --> 01:27:44.180
LIAM: Sylas Briarwood.

01:27:44.180 --> 01:27:48.290
MATT: "So that would be a way to clear your name
and clear his head."

01:27:48.290 --> 01:27:50.220
TRAVIS: Let's do that.

01:27:50.220 --> 01:27:51.791
SAM: Percival--

01:27:51.791 --> 01:27:55.260
ORION: What of eight days instead of two weeks?
Oh, sorry.

01:27:55.260 --> 01:28:04.320
SAM: Percival, what do you think we should do? Go
seek revenge on your family and get some blood on

01:28:04.320 --> 01:28:09.168
our hands, Briarwood blood? Or do the sneaky thing
and try to--

01:28:09.168 --> 01:28:11.954
LAURA: Please, we need your input.

01:28:11.954 --> 01:28:14.502
MARISHA: You know them better than anyone.

01:28:14.502 --> 01:28:19.674
TALIESIN: I really don't. I think we're here
because I wasn't prepared.

01:28:19.674 --> 01:28:23.853
MARISHA: Can I do an insight check on him? See if
he knows more than what he's saying?

01:28:23.853 --> 01:28:27.541
MATT: Sure.

01:28:27.541 --> 01:28:31.425
MARISHA: 19.

01:28:31.425 --> 01:28:35.778
MATT: You can go ahead and roll a d20.

01:28:35.778 --> 01:28:41.320
MARISHA: Is that a nine?

01:28:41.320 --> 01:28:42.849
TALIESIN: Nine.

01:28:42.849 --> 01:28:44.504
MATT: Is there anything you're holding back?

01:28:44.504 --> 01:28:45.667
TALIESIN: Nope.

01:28:45.667 --> 01:28:48.286
MATT: He seems clear as day, telling the honest
truth.

01:28:48.286 --> 01:28:56.078
LIAM: I don't think we're here in this city to
become lords and ladies serving Uriel, as good a

01:28:56.078 --> 01:29:04.348
man he is. I think Percival's our ally, and this
is a grievous wrong done to him, and we can kill

01:29:04.348 --> 01:29:06.607
two birds with one stone.

01:29:06.607 --> 01:29:11.978
TALIESIN: I think we are in the situation we're in
because we now know how much we don't know. How

01:29:11.978 --> 01:29:20.208
much I don't know. I'm not prepared. If we face
them now, I'm going to get you all killed.

01:29:20.208 --> 01:29:26.000
ORION: I agree. We need proper preparation. Percy,
I'm pretty sure you have a good background on

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:30.601
vampires and what-have-you, as do I, as I've
researched them in the last couple of days.

01:29:30.601 --> 01:29:35.490
There's other things that we should research, as
well, and probably arm ourselves for that kind of

01:29:35.490 --> 01:29:40.630
conflict, if it comes to it. Quite frankly, I have
a feeling if it's the whole town we're dealing

01:29:40.630 --> 01:29:45.969
with, we need to find out how many innocents there
are to save, and if the number is low enough, we

01:29:45.969 --> 01:29:53.392
can fly in with an army ourselves, which would
take some time. The Draconian Knights. I am an

01:29:53.392 --> 01:29:58.262
ambassador to Draconia, officially, after all the
assistance I've sent, in giving them the Wheel of

01:29:58.262 --> 01:30:00.610
Mending, and proving my point.

01:30:00.610 --> 01:30:01.733
LAURA: You gave them the Wheel?

01:30:01.733 --> 01:30:05.634
ORION: No, I showed it to them, proving that my
quest was true, which they gave me full

01:30:05.634 --> 01:30:12.080
ambassadorship, which means that, if harm comes to
a Stormwind, harm comes to all of Draconia. And a

01:30:12.080 --> 01:30:14.469
town full of vampires and liches--

01:30:14.469 --> 01:30:18.747
LAURA: I didn't know we had a whole army at our
disposal. That's wonderful to hear.

01:30:18.747 --> 01:30:20.985
ORION: If worse comes to worst.

01:30:20.985 --> 01:30:24.227
LIAM: Started on the bottom, now we're here.

01:30:24.227 --> 01:30:27.065
SAM: Diplomatic immunity.

01:30:27.065 --> 01:30:35.502
ORION: Even then, our relations must be strong
with Emon. We need their allyship, as well.

01:30:35.502 --> 01:30:39.532
Draconia will not go into things alone. We need a
union.

01:30:39.532 --> 01:30:45.890
MARISHA: I agree. While we're not serving Uriel,
that's not our purpose, I also don't want to leave

01:30:45.890 --> 01:30:52.631
an enemy of the state. That's not good for me, for
what I want.

01:30:52.631 --> 01:30:58.065
ORION: I go up to Jarett. Eight days. What do you
think of eight days?

01:30:58.065 --> 01:31:03.838
MARISHA: And what, go with Jarett? Not Jarett,
Asum.

01:31:03.838 --> 01:31:07.564
SAM: He's not even going where we would be going.
We would be going to Whitestone, right? That's

01:31:07.564 --> 01:31:09.124
where the Briarwoods are.

01:31:09.124 --> 01:31:13.176
LIAM: But Keyleth, Uriel is the law, and the law
is now corrupt.

01:31:13.176 --> 01:31:17.484
MARISHA: Then why don't we save his mind before we
go?

01:31:17.484 --> 01:31:25.282
LAURA: Here's the thing. He's going to find out
stuff about the Briarwoods. What's the fucking

01:31:25.282 --> 01:31:28.607
point of him going if we're just going to go
attack the Briarwoods before we know what he

01:31:28.607 --> 01:31:34.275
knows? We need to let him go, find out his shit,
take care of Uriel, wait until he gets back, go

01:31:34.275 --> 01:31:35.799
take out the Briarwoods--

01:31:35.799 --> 01:31:39.516
ORION: As Vex is saying this, Tiberius is getting
a half-chub.

01:31:39.516 --> 01:31:42.884
TRAVIS and LAURA: A what?

01:31:42.884 --> 01:31:44.996
TALIESIN: Well, that's just weird.

01:31:44.996 --> 01:31:46.664
ORION: You can't see it because it's inside.

01:31:46.664 --> 01:31:48.259
LIAM: Yes, but you said it out loud.

01:31:48.259 --> 01:31:49.800
MATT: Anyway.

01:31:49.800 --> 01:31:51.328
ORION: I'm just saying.

01:31:51.328 --> 01:31:53.650
SAM: It's a strategy boner?

01:31:53.650 --> 01:31:55.281
LIAM: It's a strategy chub, all right.

01:31:55.281 --> 01:31:57.679
TALIESIN: I'm still weirded out.

01:31:57.679 --> 01:32:01.034
MARISHA: You've got to give context to those
things, man.

01:32:01.034 --> 01:32:05.038
LIAM: It's an odd choice of words, but now 30
seconds later, I see what you mean

01:32:05.038 --> 01:32:10.077
ORION: Sorry. Her brain. That's what I'm talking
about.

01:32:10.077 --> 01:32:23.254
MATT: Asum says, "My getting to Wildemount is not
easy, nor is it safe. I cannot linger for long.

01:32:23.254 --> 01:32:25.025
"Maybe a few days."

01:32:25.025 --> 01:32:26.733
TALIESIN: How soon will you return?

01:32:26.733 --> 01:32:35.746
MATT: "That depends on if I even return. Every spy
I've sent to seek information on the Briarwoods or

01:32:35.746 --> 01:32:38.655
"to Whitestone has not come back."

01:32:38.655 --> 01:32:47.062
ORION: (ripping noises) I'll give him two strips of
Scroll of Telescription. If any harm falls upon

01:32:47.062 --> 01:32:49.629
you, write on this. I explain what it does.

01:32:49.629 --> 01:32:52.313
MATT: Okay. How many of those do you have left, by
the way?

01:32:52.313 --> 01:32:56.227
ORION: I have 30 tickets left, so 28 now.

01:32:56.227 --> 01:33:05.522
LIAM: I have another idea. Uriel said that-- he was
resistant, but he said that he would bring me in

01:33:05.522 --> 01:33:14.317
to have his people check me out. Check out my
story. What if Keyleth and Scanlan rode in my

01:33:14.317 --> 01:33:15.635
pockets--

01:33:15.635 --> 01:33:17.273
SAM: I'm not that small.

01:33:17.273 --> 01:33:20.018
LAURA: As roaches.

01:33:20.018 --> 01:33:22.521
LIAM: You're pretty small. Just as mice.

01:33:22.521 --> 01:33:25.467
LAURA: Or bugs. Roly-polies!

01:33:25.467 --> 01:33:32.769
LIAM: Magic user's choice. Can you cast magic when
you're transformed?

01:33:32.769 --> 01:33:34.378
SAM: No.

01:33:34.378 --> 01:33:43.039
LAURA: So they'd have to pop out. Can you shrink
yourself and still do magic teeny-tiny?

01:33:43.039 --> 01:33:46.161
SAM: Are you asking me?

01:33:46.161 --> 01:33:48.110
LAURA: Either of you.

01:33:48.110 --> 01:33:51.662
SAM: No, but I can shit on things. Yes?

01:33:51.662 --> 01:33:55.451
ORION: Can you give the Seeker an inspiration
before he goes on an adventure?

01:33:55.451 --> 01:33:59.846
SAM: It could last him 20 minutes, yes. Get him to
the docks, maybe.

01:33:59.846 --> 01:34:08.457
LAURA: Seeker, what do you think? What was your
goal of coming here?

01:34:08.457 --> 01:34:11.613
TRAVIS: Yeah, do you want us to come with you or
what?

01:34:11.613 --> 01:34:18.664
MATT: "My journey requires the utmost of silence,
speed, stealth, and I mean no offense to your

01:34:18.664 --> 01:34:27.377
"entourage, but I think I can do this alone, and
should. However, this journey may take me two

01:34:27.377 --> 01:34:31.897
"weeks, a month, many months-- I do not know. I'm
doing this just in case whatever you're choosing

01:34:31.897 --> 01:34:38.804
"to do fails. At least, if Vox Machina falls in
this, I can come back with proof enough to try, and

01:34:38.804 --> 01:34:45.235
"once the army has been gathered, perhaps we can
rally all of Emon against Whitestone."

01:34:45.235 --> 01:34:50.372
TRAVIS: If you die, can you write a letter and
sign your name saying that we were right, you were

01:34:50.372 --> 01:34:53.476
wrong, you were full of shit, the Briarwoods are
assholes--

01:34:53.476 --> 01:34:55.851
ORION: But a lot more eloquently than that.

01:34:55.851 --> 01:34:57.254
TRAVIS: Or not.

01:34:57.254 --> 01:34:58.635
MATT: "I can try my best."

01:34:58.635 --> 01:35:00.145
LAURA: That would be lovely.

01:35:00.145 --> 01:35:14.669
MARISHA: I go up to his arm, and I Druidcraft a
wooden armband. Make it look cool. And put that on

01:35:14.669 --> 01:35:15.669
him.

01:35:15.669 --> 01:35:16.913
SAM: Onto Tiberius?

01:35:16.913 --> 01:35:18.476
MARISHA: No, onto Asum.

01:35:18.476 --> 01:35:23.952
Now I can scry through that. That way I
can at least check in on you every once in a while.

01:35:23.952 --> 01:35:25.889
If you're okay with that?

01:35:25.889 --> 01:35:28.473
SAM: I could've shat on him and had the same
effect.

01:35:28.473 --> 01:35:32.857
MATT: Make a persuasion roll.

01:35:32.857 --> 01:35:40.946
LAURA: What about being invisible? Can you cast
spells while you're invisible?

01:35:40.946 --> 01:35:46.081
ORION: Only with Greater Invisibility, you can.

01:35:46.081 --> 01:35:47.484
MARISHA: 21.

01:35:47.484 --> 01:35:57.745
SAM: We've always sought out the path of the most
glory, and I think that that is the Briarwoods.

01:35:57.745 --> 01:36:08.824
Going into a giant, vampire-lich-ridden castle and
killing two evil bastards amid their army of

01:36:08.824 --> 01:36:11.560
protectors is the coolest thing we could ever do.

01:36:11.560 --> 01:36:16.246
LAURA: It's super-duper cool. Here's the thing:
it's not going to be just two, I don't think. It's

01:36:16.246 --> 01:36:19.281
going to be an entire town of people that they've
controlled.

01:36:19.281 --> 01:36:24.797
SAM: You think we can get into Sovereign Uriel
without anyone detecting magic on us? He's got

01:36:24.797 --> 01:36:27.087
clerics all round him--

01:36:27.087 --> 01:36:29.856
LAURA: Yeah, but Seeker Asum knows all the ins and
outs of the palace.

01:36:29.856 --> 01:36:31.556
LIAM: He's leaving town tomorrow.

01:36:31.556 --> 01:36:34.055
LAURA: We'd have to do it stat, but he knows how
to get in.

01:36:34.055 --> 01:36:38.341
MARISHA: He did say it was an inspired idea. His
words.

01:36:38.341 --> 01:36:44.795
MATT: "Regardless, you have to make a choice soon.
I cannot dilly-dally. I'll take your band, yes."

01:36:44.795 --> 01:36:48.855
He takes the wooden band and puts it around his
arm and says, "If this will put you at ease, I'll

01:36:48.855 --> 01:36:49.869
"take it."

01:36:49.869 --> 01:36:54.949
MARISHA: Don't worry. I won't abuse it, I promise.
Could you potentially help us with sneaking in the

01:36:54.949 --> 01:36:56.240
castle?

01:36:56.240 --> 01:36:59.848
MATT: "I could get you in the door, but I could
not escort you to that room. That would put myself

01:36:59.848 --> 01:37:02.394
"in extreme danger and the entirety of our
mission."

01:37:02.394 --> 01:37:04.493
LAURA: Could you distract people?

01:37:04.493 --> 01:37:08.067
MATT: (laughs) "I can do that quite well, yes."

01:37:08.067 --> 01:37:13.943
SAM: We can get there, but something tells me
we're still going to be fighting a big fight in a

01:37:13.943 --> 01:37:16.954
palace. I'd rather fight that big fight in the
Briarwoods'.

01:37:16.954 --> 01:37:22.723
LIAM: Scanlan and I are in agreement, and here's
the problem. If things go south in Uriel's palace,

01:37:22.723 --> 01:37:30.983
we are then forced to fight against people who are
good and true, or give up and go to jail, which

01:37:30.983 --> 01:37:31.990
sucks.

01:37:31.990 --> 01:37:35.019
SAM: But in the Briarwoods', we can kill every
motherfucker in that place.

01:37:35.019 --> 01:37:38.519
ORION: There are a number of innocents that we
need to figure out, still.

01:37:38.519 --> 01:37:40.088
MARISHA: What if we talk to Allura?

01:37:40.088 --> 01:37:42.534
SAM: You killed an old lady!

01:37:42.534 --> 01:37:45.357
ORION: She attacked us! And I will not back down
from that decision.

01:37:45.357 --> 01:37:47.714
SAM: She did have an old lady smell.

01:37:47.714 --> 01:37:54.756
TRAVIS: All right. Can we just vote on something,
please? Since Percy's being oh-so-quiet about all

01:37:54.756 --> 01:37:55.637
this.

01:37:55.637 --> 01:37:57.230
MARISHA: Percy is being very quiet about this.

01:37:57.230 --> 01:37:59.726
TRAVIS: Are you sure you have nothing to say?

01:37:59.726 --> 01:38:06.167
LAURA: It's fucking your family. It's the people
that attacked your family. Do you have no

01:38:06.167 --> 01:38:08.456
contribution to this?

01:38:08.456 --> 01:38:21.527
TALIESIN: I still feel I owe everybody an apology.
I still feel terrible about dragging you all into

01:38:21.527 --> 01:38:23.413
this and putting you in danger.

01:38:23.413 --> 01:38:25.854
LAURA: We're choosing to do it.

01:38:25.854 --> 01:38:33.528
MATT: "Vengeance." A voice whispers in your ear,
Percy. No one hears this. "Vengeance."

01:38:33.528 --> 01:38:45.468
TALIESIN: If you're with me, we can be prepared
for them this time. We know enough to prepare

01:38:45.468 --> 01:38:48.438
ourselves, we can have ourselves ready this time.

01:38:48.438 --> 01:38:54.614
ORION: How many days do we have? I would like
eight days to prepare.

01:38:54.614 --> 01:38:57.272
MARISHA: Can I see if he looks like shaken or
fucked up at all?

01:38:57.272 --> 01:39:01.770
MATT: I mean, he looks shaken and fucked up, yeah.
He's obviously had a horrible few days.

01:39:01.770 --> 01:39:04.450
TALIESIN: I think a week to prepare is
reasonable.

01:39:04.450 --> 01:39:05.637
LAURA: And then leave.

01:39:05.637 --> 01:39:07.921
TALIESIN: And then we leave. We leave quietly.

01:39:07.921 --> 01:39:10.341
MARISHA: Wait, we're leaving to Whitestone?

01:39:10.341 --> 01:39:12.753
TRAVIS and LAURA: Yes.

01:39:12.753 --> 01:39:16.561
TALIESIN: I've been avoiding it for too long, and
now I know too much.

01:39:16.561 --> 01:39:22.485
LIAM: The law of this land is compromised.
Percival, I agree with you. I think this is the

01:39:22.485 --> 01:39:24.148
right choice.

01:39:24.148 --> 01:39:26.275
TRAVIS: All in favor, say aye.

01:39:26.275 --> 01:39:28.386
ALL (except Orion): Aye.

01:39:28.386 --> 01:39:32.909
TRAVIS: All opposed, say nay. Nice.

01:39:32.909 --> 01:39:36.397
MATT: "Then it is settled. I'll be on my way."

01:39:36.397 --> 01:39:39.395
LAURA: Wait! Before you go, could I talk to you?

01:39:39.395 --> 01:39:41.641
MATT: "Certainly."

01:39:41.641 --> 01:39:45.606
LAURA: Were you going to say anything else?
Because I'll talk to you in private.

01:39:45.606 --> 01:39:51.118
MATT: "Three days and I'll be off on my side of
the mission. Very well."

01:39:51.118 --> 01:39:52.701
LAURA: I'll follow you out.

01:39:52.701 --> 01:39:55.020
MATT: Yes, and he walks out, walks with you.

01:39:55.020 --> 01:40:02.385
TALIESIN: Hold on, I'm going to hold you before
you go. I just wanted to say, I'm so sorry and

01:40:02.385 --> 01:40:09.067
thank you. And thank you for doing this for me. I
fear my temper before this weight is lifted from

01:40:09.067 --> 01:40:17.126
my heart. I do not wish to lose myself like that
again, and I am so sorry for everything I've

01:40:17.126 --> 01:40:18.685
done.

01:40:18.685 --> 01:40:25.074
ORION: Tiberius puts his hand on Percy's shoulder,
and go, I'm sorry for the tragedy which is your

01:40:25.074 --> 01:40:31.143
family, and what these Briarwoods have befallen to
them, and I will promise you, I will do my best to

01:40:31.143 --> 01:40:37.308
have you give that final blow from that barrel to
the names assigned to them. But now it is a far

01:40:37.308 --> 01:40:39.812
dangerous situation, as you very well know.

01:40:39.812 --> 01:40:44.341
TALIESIN: I will do my best to maintain myself. I
apologize.

01:40:44.341 --> 01:40:52.961
MATT: And as you all scatter, Percy, as you walk
out, the same voice creeps into your ear, "Yes."

01:40:52.961 --> 01:41:01.110
Now, as you step out with Seeker Asum, who now has
a bit of haste to his step, arms crossed, looking

01:41:01.110 --> 01:41:04.164
around. "So you wish to speak with me?"

01:41:04.164 --> 01:41:06.520
LAURA: Yes, I do. You're a ranger.

01:41:06.520 --> 01:41:07.954
MATT: "I am."

01:41:07.954 --> 01:41:10.151
LAURA: You're very sneaky.

01:41:10.151 --> 01:41:11.814
MATT: "I can be."

01:41:11.814 --> 01:41:18.324
LAURA: I've only ever seen people like thieves,
like my brother, do things like you've done. Can

01:41:18.324 --> 01:41:25.637
you teach me anything that you know to help me
maybe be a little more stealthy, as well?

01:41:25.637 --> 01:41:32.568
MATT: (sighs) "We'll go over what you know, and
perhaps there are a few tricks that I can teach you

01:41:32.568 --> 01:41:38.331
"in the three days I have. I can't guarantee that
it'll be extremely changing, as that's a very

01:41:38.331 --> 01:41:42.236
"short time to train over what I've learned over a
lifetime, but I can certainly attempt."

01:41:42.236 --> 01:41:43.769
LAURA: I appreciate it.

01:41:43.769 --> 01:41:46.181
MATT: "I require your concentration for those
days, though, before I leave."

01:41:46.181 --> 01:41:47.556
LAURA: Utmost.

01:41:47.556 --> 01:41:51.530
MATT: "All right. Meet me at the morrow, crack of
dawn. I'll be at the front of your keep."

01:41:51.530 --> 01:41:52.742
LAURA: Okay.

01:41:52.742 --> 01:41:56.694
MATT: "Very well." And he heads off, outside of
the keep. The rest of you, what are you doing?

01:41:56.694 --> 01:41:58.182
ORION: I go to my laboratory.

01:41:58.182 --> 01:41:59.778
MARISHA: What time is it?

01:41:59.778 --> 01:42:01.745
MATT: About 3:00, 4:00 in the afternoon now.

01:42:01.745 --> 01:42:05.210
TRAVIS: That temple of Sarenrae is in the city.

01:42:05.210 --> 01:42:09.781
MATT: It's part of the keep, yeah. Oh, you mean
the actual temple you went to? That is inside the

01:42:09.781 --> 01:42:14.534
city, yes. You can go into the city; you just
can't get to the Cloudtop District.

01:42:14.534 --> 01:42:18.641
ORION: Use the earring real quick. I'm going to
write a quick letter. If anybody goes shopping,

01:42:18.641 --> 01:42:19.778
let me know.

01:42:19.778 --> 01:42:21.685
MATT: Tiberius loves shopping.

01:42:21.685 --> 01:42:23.666
LAURA: He really, really does.

01:42:23.666 --> 01:42:26.681
MATT: All right, we'll go ahead and take a quick
break. We'll be back in five minutes. Keep it a

01:42:26.681 --> 01:42:28.138
stringent break, guys.

01:42:28.138 --> 01:42:31.378
LIAM: So errands will happen after that break?
Because I have some errands that I want to do.

01:42:31.378 --> 01:42:34.490
MATT: Yes. We'll try to keep the errands pretty
concise so we can keep on schedule, yeah, so it's

01:42:34.490 --> 01:42:37.494
like, use this break to conjecture exactly what
you want to do. All right, guys, we'll see you

01:42:37.494 --> 01:42:39.127
back here in five minutes.

01:42:39.127 --> 01:55:26.129
[break]

01:55:26.129 --> 01:55:31.228
MATT: Welcome back. So to try and expedite this,
over the next period of time you guys want to take

01:55:31.228 --> 01:55:34.238
to prepare, what are you going to do? Percy.

01:55:34.238 --> 01:55:39.831
TALIESIN: I'm going to finish up those things that
we talked about earlier, spend some time making

01:55:39.831 --> 01:55:47.225
some ammunition, and I'm going to attempt to build
what we were talking about earlier.

01:55:47.225 --> 01:55:50.261
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and make a tinkering check
for your ammunition.

01:55:50.261 --> 01:55:54.600
MARISHA: What we were talking about? Can I help
him with that? Can I assist him?

01:55:54.600 --> 01:55:58.193
MATT: I would say the tinkering, the mechanisms
involved, would be so far beyond your

01:55:58.193 --> 01:56:03.622
understanding as a druid. Even just metalwork in
general. You can cheer him on, but would not be

01:56:03.622 --> 01:56:04.846
able to assist him with it.

01:56:04.846 --> 01:56:08.022
MARISHA: Go Percy, go! That's pretty good.

01:56:08.022 --> 01:56:09.449
TALIESIN: 24.

01:56:09.449 --> 01:56:19.692
MATT: 24? Okay. You manage to produce 25 rounds
for your Pepperbox and ten rounds for the Bad

01:56:19.692 --> 01:56:20.699
News.

01:56:20.699 --> 01:56:22.927
LAURA: Ooh, that's good.

01:56:22.927 --> 01:56:26.896
MARISHA: You still have inspiration from Scanlan?

01:56:26.896 --> 01:56:28.908
TALIESIN: No, I used that.

01:56:28.908 --> 01:56:48.288
MATT: Used that to repair his Pepperbox. Roll for
the secondary construction. Smoke bombs.

01:56:48.288 --> 01:56:52.912
TALIESIN: Okay. 11.

01:56:52.912 --> 01:57:01.663
MATT: 11. You take a better part of two days
attempting to get these to work, and most of your

01:57:01.663 --> 01:57:05.925
materials are ruined, unfortunately. You manage to
come out with it with, and I want you to write

01:57:05.925 --> 01:57:13.569
this down, "smoke bomb, question mark." It may
function. We will see upon use. But you have one

01:57:13.569 --> 01:57:21.268
at your disposal that is questionable. However,
for the cost of the ammunition and the cost of the

01:57:21.268 --> 01:57:27.371
smoke bomb's construction, already that comes to
about, I'd say 75 gold pieces, so mark that off.

01:57:27.371 --> 01:57:35.916
And you're attempting to make, you're attempting
to make, based on what you told me, an Archimedes

01:57:35.916 --> 01:57:37.071
death ray.

01:57:37.071 --> 01:57:42.686
TALIESIN: They're not hard. I say that as, like,
knowing my actual skill level, I could make one.

01:57:42.686 --> 01:57:47.234
MATT: You could. To be functional with the
materials that are at your disposal, it's going to

01:57:47.234 --> 01:57:49.785
be very large and hard to move.

01:57:49.785 --> 01:57:52.711
MARISHA: We were talking about making it
collapsible.

01:57:52.711 --> 01:57:58.584
TALIESIN: I could make a collapsible one, where
it's basically a one-third dodecahedron, like an

01:57:58.584 --> 01:57:59.920
observatory.

01:57:59.920 --> 01:58:07.111
MATT: You spend the remainder of this week of
preparation. Go ahead and roll your tinkering

01:58:07.111 --> 01:58:10.861
check. This is going to cost you in materials.

01:58:10.861 --> 01:58:16.428
ORION: Wait, hold on, can I pause real quick? You
don't need to do this if you want to make more

01:58:16.428 --> 01:58:20.992
ammo and other stuff. I can do this without you
making this and spending the rest of the time, if

01:58:20.992 --> 01:58:24.304
you want to make other stuff. Option.

01:58:24.304 --> 01:58:26.759
MATT: What do you want to do?

01:58:26.759 --> 01:58:29.920
TALIESIN: Story-wise it's more amusing.

01:58:29.920 --> 01:58:32.723
MATT: Okay, go for it. All right, so. The actual
materials for this--

01:58:32.723 --> 01:58:34.281
TALIESIN: It's copper.

01:58:34.281 --> 01:58:39.078
MATT: I know, it's copper, but the actual
dodecahedron that's involved, the mirrors, the

01:58:39.078 --> 01:58:43.255
lenses, the whole thing? In order to be of the
scale and quality to even make it even remotely

01:58:43.255 --> 01:58:47.520
functional, all of it for the extremely high
quality and some of it custom-made within

01:58:47.520 --> 01:58:51.528
the first couple days within this, with a rush
order. I'd say the total cost is going to come to

01:58:51.528 --> 01:58:53.512
about 1,200 gold pieces.

01:58:53.512 --> 01:58:56.246
MARISHA: I'll pitch in for that. How much do you
have?

01:58:56.246 --> 01:58:59.081
TALIESIN: At this point I have less than 100
gold.

01:58:59.081 --> 01:59:01.409
MARISHA: You have less than 100 gold? I'll pay for
it in full.

01:59:01.409 --> 01:59:03.384
ORION: What is the diameter of this?

01:59:03.384 --> 01:59:11.918
MATT: The actual focal lens is about this big. The
whole construct can be carried by two people.

01:59:11.918 --> 01:59:15.054
TALIESIN: But it will fold.

01:59:15.054 --> 01:59:22.262
ORION: I was just going to say, what's the radius
of the actual thing's lens?

01:59:22.262 --> 01:59:26.453
MATT: Of the lens itself? This is the radius of
the lens. I mean, even when it's collapsed, it can

01:59:26.453 --> 01:59:29.680
be carried by one person, but it's still a heavy
mechanism.

01:59:29.680 --> 01:59:32.324
ORION: So it's only one foot? Two feet? Three
feet?

01:59:32.324 --> 01:59:35.372
MATT: I'd say it's about two and a half feet in
diameter.

01:59:35.372 --> 01:59:38.210
ORION: Are you sure you want to do that?

01:59:38.210 --> 01:59:40.197
MATT: He's already agreed. Go ahead and roll.

01:59:40.197 --> 01:59:43.360
MARISHA: Why? It's fine. This is what we were
talking about.

01:59:43.360 --> 01:59:47.844
TALIESIN: 22.

01:59:47.844 --> 02:00:02.189
MATT: 22. Through the materials and the construct
of it, you get partway through the final stages of

02:00:02.189 --> 02:00:07.822
it, and as you're tightening one of the sections,
all of a sudden there's a (cracking) sound. Your

02:00:07.822 --> 02:00:11.226
whole body freezes as you glance over. the lens
itself has a giant crack through it.

02:00:11.226 --> 02:00:14.264
TALIESIN: There shouldn't be a glass piece-- aw,
man.

02:00:14.264 --> 02:00:20.936
MATT: For the construct for this one, there was a
focusing lens that is part of what the initial

02:00:20.936 --> 02:00:24.217
blast, otherwise there wouldn't be a point of
actually projecting a ray from.

02:00:24.217 --> 02:00:26.354
ORION: I thought they were all mirrors.

02:00:26.354 --> 02:00:30.282
MATT: There's all different sorts of construction
based on. This one's the one we're going on here,

02:00:30.282 --> 02:00:33.695
or if you can say the center of it is a gem, but
regardless, the tinkering roll was not high enough

02:00:33.695 --> 02:00:37.170
to construct the device. Sorry.

02:00:37.170 --> 02:00:42.293
MARISHA: The whole thing's wasted? Can we try and
repair the crack?

02:00:42.293 --> 02:00:47.994
MATT: It's not something you can repair. The
entire piece is constructed from a solid piece.

02:00:47.994 --> 02:00:50.517
TALIESIN: What, could we put it on the Mending
Wheel?

02:00:50.517 --> 02:00:52.604
MATT: You could attempt to.

02:00:52.604 --> 02:00:59.122
ORION: (grunting) Let's see. Okay. (clicking
noise)

02:00:59.122 --> 02:01:06.635
TRAVIS: I want to go to the store. I would like to
get a shovel and a pickaxe.

02:01:06.635 --> 02:01:08.827
ORION: You going to Gilmore's? We're going to
Gilmore's, too. We could go together if you're

02:01:08.827 --> 02:01:09.970
doing that.

02:01:09.970 --> 02:01:12.815
TRAVIS: I don't give a fuck where we go. Just a
shovel and a pickaxe.

02:01:12.815 --> 02:01:25.072
MATT: Pickaxe... comes to four gold pieces for
the two of those. You got them. Make a secondary

02:01:25.072 --> 02:01:27.387
tinkering check.

02:01:27.387 --> 02:01:32.288
TALIESIN: 22.

02:01:32.288 --> 02:01:39.345
MATT: 22. This time you go back and as you're
tightening it, the actual metal housing of the

02:01:39.345 --> 02:01:45.843
device ends up bending in a way that both cracks
the gem and causes the frame itself to be dented to

02:01:45.843 --> 02:01:51.991
the point where the beam will be imperfect. This
is a very hard thing that you've come up with in

02:01:51.991 --> 02:01:56.193
your mind that has not been constructed before,
and the level of difficulty to create this is very

02:01:56.193 --> 02:02:00.532
difficult. It does not cost you additional money,
thanks to the Mending Wheel, but right now the

02:02:00.532 --> 02:02:07.448
entire device looks like to continue, it's going
to take more time and money to construct it.

02:02:07.448 --> 02:02:12.339
TALIESIN: (sighs) I can always use this for spare
parts for other things.

02:02:12.339 --> 02:02:16.664
LAURA: You're already 1,200 in? How much more
would you have to put in?

02:02:16.664 --> 02:02:19.293
MATT: I'd say about half the cost. An additional 600.

02:02:19.293 --> 02:02:22.429
MARISHA: And how many more days?

02:02:22.429 --> 02:02:23.880
MATT: Two more days.

02:02:23.880 --> 02:02:26.304
MARISHA: How many more days do we have?

02:02:26.304 --> 02:02:30.861
MATT: You agreed upon eight, so we'd be pushing
about seven, then.

02:02:30.861 --> 02:02:36.439
TALIESIN: I've already built a smoke bomb and
some rounds of bullets. All right, I'll put a

02:02:36.529 --> 02:02:39.246
little more time in this. Can I get some
inspiration for this, too, if that would be

02:02:39.246 --> 02:02:40.561
possible?

02:02:40.561 --> 02:02:42.400
LIAM: Music, you mean?

02:02:42.400 --> 02:02:44.304
MARISHA: There's nothing I can do to help him?

02:02:44.304 --> 02:02:46.796
MATT: Unfortunately-- what's your intellect?

02:02:46.796 --> 02:02:52.776
MARISHA: My intellect? I've got plus three.

02:02:52.776 --> 02:02:56.999
SAM: (singing) Here comes the sun--

02:02:56.999 --> 02:03:04.474
ALL: (singing) It's all right. (vocalizing)

02:03:04.474 --> 02:03:06.132
LIAM: (singing) Kill the vampire.

02:03:06.132 --> 02:03:10.852
MARISHA and TALIESIN: Come on, come on.

02:03:10.852 --> 02:03:14.621
MARISHA: Percy roll. Come on.

02:03:14.621 --> 02:03:17.883
TALIESIN: 23?

02:03:17.883 --> 02:03:28.168
MATT: Working on the device a third time, you get
it right to the point where you think it could

02:03:28.168 --> 02:03:32.995
work and you go to set it up, and as you do, you
find that the light focuses in a way that actually

02:03:32.995 --> 02:03:37.662
slowly melts the copper on the outside of the
housing of the device, and it begins to melt onto

02:03:37.662 --> 02:03:43.646
itself, and you have to pull it out of the light.
This design is beyond your grasp right now. You're

02:03:43.646 --> 02:03:50.062
inventing something that takes quite a lot of time
to eventually perfect.

02:03:50.062 --> 02:04:02.081
TALIESIN: Okay. I'm going to put these away for a
later time, and if I have one more day, I would

02:04:02.081 --> 02:04:03.963
like to work on--

02:04:03.963 --> 02:04:07.896
MARISHA: Maybe a version of it that is not
collapsible that we can at least mount?

02:04:07.896 --> 02:04:10.568
TALIESIN: We've got it taken care of.

02:04:10.568 --> 02:04:12.146
MATT: That's been your guys' week.

02:04:12.146 --> 02:04:13.620
TALIESIN: That's my week, okay.

02:04:13.620 --> 02:04:19.010
MATT: Okay. You bought your pickaxe and your
shovel. Cool. Vex, what are you doing?

02:04:19.010 --> 02:04:20.361
LAURA: I'm training.

02:04:20.361 --> 02:04:22.122
MATT: You're training, okay.

02:04:22.122 --> 02:04:25.974
LIAM: All right. I want to be brief. I have four
things I want to do, but I'll be very brief. I

02:04:25.974 --> 02:04:31.723
promise. Okay, so first thing I want to do is I
think at some point, I heard Tiberius talking about

02:04:31.723 --> 02:04:36.973
wooden stakes and vampires. So I want to go buy
about ten wooden stakes.

02:04:36.973 --> 02:04:38.678
ORION: I give him extra. Get me 20.

02:04:38.678 --> 02:04:40.851
LIAM: I'm going shopping.

02:04:40.851 --> 02:04:42.971
LAURA: Yes, get me some holy arrows.

02:04:42.971 --> 02:04:50.322
LIAM: Can I get a loaner on that? I've got about
230 gold.

02:04:50.322 --> 02:04:52.978
TRAVIS: I thought you said you were going to be
brief. (laughs)

02:04:52.978 --> 02:04:54.877
LIAM: On my own.

02:04:54.877 --> 02:04:57.306
MARISHA: I thought we got a bit of an allowance.

02:04:57.306 --> 02:05:04.195
LIAM: It's a week, so I get some gold from these
people and I go and I don't even know what they

02:05:04.195 --> 02:05:06.915
said. I'm getting ten wooden stakes for myself.

02:05:06.915 --> 02:05:12.584
MATT: 20, technically, because Tiberius requested
ten. Those will cost you a total of two gold.

02:05:12.584 --> 02:05:14.991
LIAM: That's what I thought. And what did you
want?

02:05:14.991 --> 02:05:16.722
LAURA: I wanted some holy arrows.

02:05:16.722 --> 02:05:18.080
MATT: Make an investigation check.

02:05:18.080 --> 02:05:21.584
LAURA: Or holy water. Try to get some holy water.
Holy oil.

02:05:21.584 --> 02:05:27.884
LIAM: I'll get to that. Investigation, you say?
That is a 13.

02:05:27.884 --> 02:05:37.122
MATT: 13. Asking around the town: holy arrows,
that is an enchantment. They're pricey and they

02:05:37.122 --> 02:05:40.858
don't appear to be anywhere in the major shops,
even shops like Gilmore's, that they specialize

02:05:40.858 --> 02:05:49.520
in. It's usually a special order-type thing. Holy
water flasks can be purchased at 20 gold apiece.

02:05:49.520 --> 02:05:53.914
LIAM: I'll get to that. All right, so we got wood.
That was two gold, you said. All right, minus two.

02:05:53.914 --> 02:06:07.181
The next thing I want to do is go to the temple of
Sarenrae and get my sister's holy oil for her. How

02:06:07.181 --> 02:06:08.691
much is that?

02:06:08.691 --> 02:06:11.212
MATT: Holy oil? As opposed to the holy water?

02:06:11.212 --> 02:06:13.844
LIAM: I'll take both, if you've got it.

02:06:13.844 --> 02:06:19.354
MATT: Well, holy oil is a more expensive version.
Holy water is a one-use. Holy oil can be applied

02:06:19.354 --> 02:06:20.718
to a weapon.

02:06:20.718 --> 02:06:24.296
LIAM: Holy oil.

02:06:24.296 --> 02:06:26.087
ORION: How much do the stakes weigh? Like each
stake?

02:06:26.087 --> 02:06:32.697
MATT: A cluster of ten, if that's what you wanted,
would weigh about five pounds. But they're

02:06:32.697 --> 02:06:34.573
relatively light.

02:06:34.573 --> 02:06:36.879
ORION: Tell him that he bought me 20 more.

02:06:36.879 --> 02:06:39.192
SAM: Tell him that he bought you?

02:06:39.192 --> 02:06:51.847
LIAM: 40 stakes, four gold. Totally happened. Then
I went to the temple of Sarenrae and I got two

02:06:51.847 --> 02:06:54.515
vials of holy oil. One for my sister, one for me.

02:06:54.515 --> 02:06:56.205
MATT: Those are 100 gold apiece.

02:06:56.205 --> 02:07:02.322
LIAM: Okay. Got it. I can't. Oh, you gave me gold.
I'll get four vials of that.

02:07:02.322 --> 02:07:04.569
LAURA: Yeah, I gave him gold to do it.

02:07:04.569 --> 02:07:14.163
LIAM: We'll work that out, I promise. I ask if the
cleric who helped bring Pike back to life is

02:07:14.163 --> 02:07:15.497
here.

02:07:15.497 --> 02:07:17.221
MATT: Yeah, Tristan is here.

02:07:17.221 --> 02:07:18.878
LIAM: Jesus, how do you do that?

02:07:18.878 --> 02:07:20.323
MATT: Because I have to.

02:07:20.323 --> 02:07:27.654
LIAM: When I find him I say, you remember my
friend Pike? You remember me?

02:07:27.654 --> 02:07:32.011
MATT: "Yes, I inspected you. Is that healing well,
by the way?" He inspects the wounds on the side of

02:07:32.011 --> 02:07:32.991
your neck.

02:07:32.991 --> 02:07:41.382
LIAM: It is. I'm grateful. I need a keepsake of
your deity.

02:07:41.382 --> 02:08:15.595
[no audio]

02:08:15.595 --> 02:08:20.528
MATT: And he steps away, goes back, disappears for
a minute, comes back and he's holding in a chain

02:08:20.528 --> 02:08:28.790
around his neck-- It's seen some years of use, but
still clean and very well kept, an identical holy

02:08:28.790 --> 02:08:32.718
symbol of Sarenrae as the one that Pike keeps
around her neck. He hands it over and puts it over

02:08:32.718 --> 02:08:38.412
your head. "May she keep you safe and bring your
soul to redemption."

02:08:38.412 --> 02:08:40.760
LIAM: It reminds me of my friend.

02:08:40.760 --> 02:08:43.730
MATT: "As it should." Pats you on the cheek. "As
it should."

02:08:43.730 --> 02:08:52.035
LIAM: All right, so chore number two down. I would
like to go to Uriel's temple and ask the guards if

02:08:52.035 --> 02:08:55.124
anyone has seen my belt, Simon.

02:08:55.124 --> 02:08:59.483
MATT: You are stopped at the edge of the Cloudtop
District. The guards see you as you approach and

02:08:59.483 --> 02:09:03.843
block the doorway and say, "We're sorry, but
Vox Machina has been given no passage into the

02:09:03.843 --> 02:09:05.974
"Cloudtop District at this time."

02:09:05.974 --> 02:09:11.782
LIAM: I understand. I don't mean to go in. I
understand that we caused a lot of trouble, and I

02:09:11.782 --> 02:09:20.655
am very sorry, and I don't mean to be any further
trouble. There is a belt that I left inside.

02:09:20.655 --> 02:09:25.287
MATT: "That's certainly unfortunate, isn't it?"

02:09:25.287 --> 02:09:29.276
LIAM: Have you seen a snake called Simon? Or any
snake?

02:09:29.276 --> 02:09:35.250
MATT: Both the guards look at each other and laugh
for a second. "Piss off."

02:09:35.250 --> 02:09:37.890
LIAM: Okay. Chore number four.

02:09:37.890 --> 02:09:41.091
(laughter)

02:09:41.091 --> 02:09:48.632
LIAM: I go back. I give everybody their things. I
would like to spend the rest of the week, because

02:09:48.632 --> 02:10:02.519
I am ready, hanging out across the road from the
butcher's house that Kynan ran from, and if there

02:10:02.519 --> 02:10:16.872
are any youths his age who go there to shop, I
would like to ask as they leave if they have any

02:10:16.872 --> 02:10:19.189
idea where he's gone.

02:10:19.189 --> 02:10:24.018
MATT: Okay. Make a perception check.

02:10:24.018 --> 02:10:34.024
LIAM: Perception check. Oh, that's a seven.
Thought it was a one. (laughs) That is a 17.

02:10:34.024 --> 02:10:38.221
MATT: 17. Okay. Keeping an eye out, you do
eventually come across a boy that looks about his

02:10:38.221 --> 02:10:43.640
age. Late teens, maybe early twenties. Comes by
and gathers a little bit of meat and rushes off

02:10:43.640 --> 02:10:44.850
and you stop him.

02:10:44.850 --> 02:10:50.262
LIAM: Excuse me, I'm sorry to take you away from your
day. I'm sorry, what is your name?

02:10:50.262 --> 02:10:52.043
MATT: "Jameson."

02:10:52.043 --> 02:10:53.156
LIAM: Jameson.

02:10:53.156 --> 02:10:56.086
MATT: "Yeah, can I help you? I've really got to get
home with this."

02:10:56.086 --> 02:11:02.040
LIAM: I understand, I'll just take a second of
your time. I owe a boy who lives here named Kynan,

02:11:02.040 --> 02:11:08.649
I owe him a few silver and I want to see that he
gets it. Is he in town?

02:11:08.649 --> 02:11:10.256
MATT: Make a deception check.

02:11:10.256 --> 02:11:18.266
LIAM: I'll use the meteorite. That's a 15.

02:11:18.266 --> 02:11:26.755
MATT: 15, gives you a look over and goes, "I'm
certain you've given him silver, but Kynan's been gone

02:11:26.755 --> 02:11:28.256
"for the better part of a week."

02:11:28.256 --> 02:11:29.977
LIAM: Where would he have gone?

02:11:29.977 --> 02:11:33.867
MATT: "I don't know. He just told us all he
was off to find his destiny or some sort of

02:11:33.867 --> 02:11:37.791
"bullshit like that. He's always had his head in
the clouds, that one."

02:11:37.791 --> 02:11:43.107
LIAM: I agree. He ever talked about where he was
going, how he meant to go about doing it?

02:11:43.107 --> 02:11:50.071
MATT: "No, kept to himself mostly. Sorry, I wish I
could be more of a service. If I see him, where

02:11:50.071 --> 02:11:52.435
"should I send him?"

02:11:52.435 --> 02:11:56.184
(clattering)

02:11:56.184 --> 02:12:05.688
LIAM: I don't know who that guy is. If you see
him, tell him that V. is looking for him at

02:12:05.688 --> 02:12:07.354
Greyskull Keep.

02:12:07.354 --> 02:12:09.200
MATT: "Well, I'll pass that along."

02:12:09.200 --> 02:12:10.293
LIAM: Thank you.

02:12:10.293 --> 02:12:14.662
MATT: "Good day," and he hurries off to continue
with his errand.

02:12:14.662 --> 02:12:16.623
LIAM: Are you all right, old man?

02:12:16.623 --> 02:12:18.390
TRAVIS: (old-man voice) I'm fine. It's my knee.

02:12:18.390 --> 02:12:20.751
(laughter)

02:12:20.751 --> 02:12:21.862
MATT: Is that your last errand?

02:12:21.862 --> 02:12:22.703
LIAM: That's it.

02:12:22.703 --> 02:12:23.859
MATT: Scanlan.

02:12:23.859 --> 02:12:25.500
SAM: I go to Gilmore's. Are we near Gilmore's?

02:12:25.500 --> 02:12:28.713
MATT: Yeah, Gilmore's in the city. He's not in the
Cloudtop, so you have access to him still.

02:12:28.713 --> 02:12:36.314
SAM: I want to know if such a thing exists, and if
so, how much. A potion or a scroll that could

02:12:36.314 --> 02:12:40.695
invoke either Hallow or Spirit Guardians.

02:12:40.695 --> 02:12:45.777
TALIESIN: Say what?

02:12:45.777 --> 02:12:57.061
SAM: Spirit Guardians is four. Hallow is five.

02:12:57.061 --> 02:13:11.181
MATT: Here we go. Okay. Asking around, there are
no potions for it, but there is a Scroll of Hallow

02:13:11.181 --> 02:13:21.020
available, and I will say that comes to roughly
6,000 gold pieces for the Scroll of Hallow.

02:13:21.020 --> 02:13:24.920
MARISHA: It's how much?

02:13:24.920 --> 02:13:31.797
MATT: 6,000 for the Hallow Scroll. And for the
Spirit Guardian, you said it was? 4th-level?

02:13:31.797 --> 02:13:33.003
SAM: 4th-level.

02:13:33.003 --> 02:13:34.545
MATT: That one is 2,000 gold.

02:13:34.545 --> 02:13:37.677
LAURA: What does that do?

02:13:37.677 --> 02:13:46.268
SAM: Spirit Guardians would make some beings
around us.

02:13:46.268 --> 02:13:52.532
MATT: Spirit Guardians is level three, actually,
not level four. That makes it a lot cheaper. That

02:13:52.532 --> 02:13:54.290
is 600 gold.

02:13:54.290 --> 02:13:59.514
SAM: It scares evil things away. It's like a
Pike-y thing.

02:13:59.514 --> 02:14:01.044
LAURA: Do it.

02:14:01.044 --> 02:14:08.646
SAM: Can I cast that if I have a scroll?

02:14:08.646 --> 02:14:11.406
MATT: If you have a scroll you can, yeah. It has a
chance of failing.

02:14:11.406 --> 02:14:15.463
MARISHA: Yeah, you have to have magic.

02:14:15.463 --> 02:14:18.251
SAM: How much did you say?

02:14:18.251 --> 02:14:19.264
MATT: 600 gold pieces.

02:14:19.264 --> 02:14:20.631
SAM: I'll buy one of those.

02:14:20.631 --> 02:14:23.108
MATT: There's only one available. So you mark that
down.

02:14:23.108 --> 02:14:33.337
SAM: Okay. Yes, I will. I would also like to find
a smithy of some sort and make me a little metal

02:14:33.337 --> 02:14:36.428
choker of chainmail.

02:14:36.428 --> 02:14:44.671
MATT: Okay, remembering that you have spoken to
Karin before, which is the renowned custom

02:14:44.671 --> 02:14:52.357
blacksmith in Emon, you speak with her. A
chainmail half coif around the neck there is

02:14:52.357 --> 02:14:57.099
relatively inexpensive. It's a partial piece of
armor. She looks at some scrap chainmail on the

02:14:57.099 --> 02:15:00.386
side and is like: "I'd be more than happy to use
that for it. It shouldn't me take more than an hour,

02:15:00.386 --> 02:15:01.642
"two maybe at most."

02:15:01.642 --> 02:15:02.894
LAURA: Get one for everyone.

02:15:02.894 --> 02:15:05.295
TRAVIS: I think they can bite besides the neck,
right?

02:15:05.295 --> 02:15:07.338
LAURA: Yeah, technically, but still!

02:15:07.338 --> 02:15:11.267
SAM: (laughs) Sure, I'll get eight of them, or
seven of them.

02:15:11.267 --> 02:15:14.152
MATT: Okay. (laughs) All right.

02:15:14.152 --> 02:15:15.518
SAM: How much are they?

02:15:15.518 --> 02:15:18.831
MATT: Seven of those. I'd say for the whole seven
it'd put you at 100 gold, because it's custom

02:15:18.831 --> 02:15:21.106
orders. Seven of those.

02:15:21.106 --> 02:15:22.827
LIAM: What are they?

02:15:22.827 --> 02:15:25.032
SAM: Chainmail chokers

02:15:25.032 --> 02:15:26.453
MARISHA: Chainmail dickies.

02:15:26.453 --> 02:15:29.514
TRAVIS: Oh wait, do you have one more?

02:15:29.514 --> 02:15:34.346
SAM: And a small one for my dick.

02:15:34.346 --> 02:15:36.938
(laughter)

02:15:36.938 --> 02:15:37.866
MATT: All righty.

02:15:37.866 --> 02:15:38.854
SAM: A tiny one.

02:15:38.854 --> 02:15:46.569
MATT: She awkwardly judges and turns that request
down. She's uncomfortable with that.

02:15:46.569 --> 02:15:49.581
SAM: Then I bow and leave.

02:15:49.581 --> 02:15:55.200
MATT: Okay. So you got that. Yes. Just a second
there, Tiberius.

02:15:55.200 --> 02:16:01.721
LIAM: I go to Gilmore's Glorious Goods and ask at
the front door if Gilmore is there.

02:16:01.721 --> 02:16:07.257
MATT: Gilmore, unfortunately, is in Westruun
currently. Still overseeing the construction of

02:16:07.257 --> 02:16:08.860
his expansion there.

02:16:08.860 --> 02:16:13.403
LIAM: Understood. Who's the most knowledgeable
person next to Gilmore in this store right now?

02:16:13.403 --> 02:16:34.532
MATT: That would be... I can't find my
updated NPC sheet. Do you remember what her name

02:16:34.532 --> 02:16:35.434
was?

02:16:35.434 --> 02:16:36.317
MARISHA: Sherri.

02:16:36.317 --> 02:16:42.150
MATT: Sherri, thank you. I was like, Shelby? No.
Sherri. Sherri is there greeting you. "That would

02:16:42.150 --> 02:16:43.876
"probably be me."

02:16:43.876 --> 02:16:50.018
LIAM: Oh, hi. You remember me. I have a very
important question. I won't take up much of your

02:16:50.018 --> 02:16:59.099
time. I pull out a small metal skull cap. Dented
in a few places, rusted a bit, from the Underdark.

02:16:59.099 --> 02:17:03.690
What can you tell me about this?

02:17:03.690 --> 02:17:10.540
MATT: She takes it. "If you're requesting
identification of a magical item, that is a

02:17:10.540 --> 02:17:12.257
"service we charge."

02:17:12.257 --> 02:17:16.923
LIAM: Sis, can I borrow some money?

02:17:16.923 --> 02:17:19.672
LAURA: How much do you need?

02:17:19.672 --> 02:17:22.096
LIAM: How much would that require?

02:17:22.096 --> 02:17:24.777
MATT: "125 gold pieces per enchantment
identified."

02:17:24.777 --> 02:17:25.737
LIAM: Done.

02:17:25.737 --> 02:17:26.639
MATT: "All right."

02:17:26.639 --> 02:17:27.876
LAURA: Talk her down.

02:17:27.876 --> 02:17:31.615
MATT: She takes it. She steps inside, sets it on
the counter. She starts going through her books

02:17:31.615 --> 02:17:37.432
and starts looking at it and holding it for a
second and doing a full inspection of it. "Based

02:17:37.432 --> 02:17:44.538
"on the enchantment on this device, it's very crude
in construction and the enchantment is in an

02:17:44.538 --> 02:17:49.998
"arcane offshoot of language I'm not very familiar
with, but it appears it is a guard from some sort

02:17:49.998 --> 02:17:57.801
"of a mental influence. If worn, it would give you
a stronger resistance against things that would

02:17:57.801 --> 02:18:00.706
"attempt to peer into your mind."

02:18:00.706 --> 02:18:04.059
LIAM: Are we talking magic?

02:18:04.059 --> 02:18:08.497
MATT: "Yes." So essentially what it would do is it
would give you advantage on wisdom saving throws

02:18:08.497 --> 02:18:10.097
against magic spells.

02:18:10.097 --> 02:18:11.215
LIAM: Against?

02:18:11.215 --> 02:18:15.445
MATT: It would give you advantage on wisdom saving
throws against magical effects.

02:18:15.445 --> 02:18:24.704
LIAM: That's fucking brilliant. I hand her the
gold and say, Scanlan sends his regards.

02:18:24.704 --> 02:18:34.019
MATT: She noticeably blushes and goes, "Well, send
mine back if you wouldn't mind. I've got work to

02:18:34.019 --> 02:18:35.513
"do." And she rushes off.

02:18:35.513 --> 02:18:37.104
LIAM: Thank you.

02:18:37.104 --> 02:18:39.418
MATT: All right. Now, Tiberius.

02:18:39.418 --> 02:18:42.432
SAM: 16 errands.

02:18:42.432 --> 02:18:51.444
ORION: I only have eight. Just kidding, no. The
real quick one is going to the Temple of

02:18:51.444 --> 02:18:52.915
Sarenrae to pick up a canteen.

02:18:52.915 --> 02:18:59.172
MATT: Okay. Did you pay for it already? You paid
up front. Okay. So you get the canteen, the

02:18:59.172 --> 02:19:07.917
explanation is: the enchantment of the actual
water creation itself is separate than the holy

02:19:07.917 --> 02:19:11.491
enchantment that has been attached to it. The holy
enchantment is not very powerful because it is an

02:19:11.491 --> 02:19:17.221
enchanted item. How it functions is the first
burst per day that you use of the water does an

02:19:17.221 --> 02:19:21.528
additional 1d6 radiant damage. That's it. But any
additional after that is just water. Basically,

02:19:21.528 --> 02:19:27.087
whatever water is immediately contained within it
at the start of the day is considered blessed.

02:19:27.087 --> 02:19:30.408
Once that's expelled, all the rest that it
creates-- because it's pulling it out of the

02:19:30.408 --> 02:19:34.186
elemental plane of water; that's how it's
continuously projecting it. The rest of it runs

02:19:34.186 --> 02:19:38.247
straight through, so it doesn't have a chance to
even absorb the blessing.

02:19:38.247 --> 02:19:48.603
ORION: Gotcha. Okay, cool. Second thing. I drop
off my Swallow, or I'll call it the surge blade,

02:19:48.603 --> 02:19:53.299
and to have that enchanted on both ends.

02:19:53.299 --> 02:19:54.518
MATT: With?

02:19:54.518 --> 02:20:01.876
ORION: One side fire, the other side water. So
however many mages I have to hire for that to

02:20:01.876 --> 02:20:05.484
happen in ten days, I think we talked about it
being eight days or something like that? Or was

02:20:05.484 --> 02:20:07.565
that only one side?

02:20:07.565 --> 02:20:15.058
MATT: (laughs) So what enchantment do you want? Do
you want to just do an additional-- What do you

02:20:15.058 --> 02:20:16.278
want it to be?

02:20:16.278 --> 02:20:18.313
ORION: I just want it to be a magical weapon.

02:20:18.313 --> 02:20:25.229
MATT: Just a magical weapon? Okay, just a general
plus-one magical weapon. Okay. That would take

02:20:25.229 --> 02:20:35.238
about-- let me double-check the rarity here.

02:20:35.238 --> 02:20:44.247
SAM: In the meantime, check out those Critical
Role keychains available on Geek and Sundry.

02:20:44.247 --> 02:20:46.389
(laughter)

02:20:46.389 --> 02:20:53.919
MATT: That would run you approximately 700 gold to
create it as a plus-one magical item. Would take

02:20:53.919 --> 02:20:55.885
one mage a week to do it.

02:20:55.885 --> 02:20:59.362
ORION: Okay. So I'll do that.

02:20:59.362 --> 02:21:07.047
MATT: Okay, so for the week it takes, you pay
700 gold pieces. Your quarterstaff with a

02:21:07.047 --> 02:21:13.086
couple of daggers tied to the end is now
considered a plus-one magical weapon.

02:21:13.086 --> 02:21:18.214
(laughter)

02:21:18.214 --> 02:21:29.413
ORION: I stop at Gilmore's and I drop off my Ring
of Protection. And pay whatever that is to add a

02:21:29.413 --> 02:21:33.661
plus-one to make it instead of a minor, an actual
Ring of Protection.

02:21:33.661 --> 02:21:38.456
MATT: Unfortunately, the thing is, an enchantment
cannot be progressively enhanced. You would

02:21:38.456 --> 02:21:41.136
have to disenchant and then re-enchant the entire
thing.

02:21:41.136 --> 02:21:44.172
ORION: I thought Gilmore said they could do that
there, before. That's why I was going to cough up

02:21:44.172 --> 02:21:46.878
the green for the Gil, as it were.

02:21:46.878 --> 02:21:52.097
MATT: No. They can enchant the item with it, but
it would be the cost of basically re-enchanting

02:21:52.097 --> 02:21:53.061
the item.

02:21:53.061 --> 02:21:55.954
ORION: How much would that be?

02:21:55.954 --> 02:22:13.311
MATT: That would cost approximately 25,000 gold
pieces.

02:22:13.311 --> 02:22:14.706
SAM: Oh jeez.

02:22:14.706 --> 02:22:20.737
MATT: And it would take the better part of a year. A
plus-two Ring of Protection is a very powerful

02:22:20.737 --> 02:22:21.647
item.

02:22:21.647 --> 02:22:23.163
SAM: It's worth it. It's a good investment.

02:22:23.163 --> 02:22:26.186
MATT: That you even acquired one earlier was great
luck.

02:22:26.186 --> 02:22:29.496
ORION: How about buffing the ring of source
spelling--

02:22:29.496 --> 02:22:32.558
MATT: The Ring of Spell Storing?

02:22:32.558 --> 02:22:36.163
SAM: The thing that I had that I still want. That
one.

02:22:36.163 --> 02:22:47.314
MATT: The Ring of Spell Storing? That's its
enchantment. There is no more powerful version of

02:22:47.314 --> 02:22:54.046
the Ring of Spell Storing. If you wanted to attempt to
do that yourself on your own time, you could. That

02:22:54.046 --> 02:22:58.291
will cost you upward 60,000 gold pieces and about
a year.

02:22:58.291 --> 02:23:00.149
ORION: No, not right now.

02:23:00.149 --> 02:23:03.295
LAURA: How about we stick to the level we're at?

02:23:03.295 --> 02:23:06.222
ORION: I didn't know all that stuff was going to
be that way. That's why I asked.

02:23:06.222 --> 02:23:08.358
LIAM: How do you learn if you don't ask?

02:23:08.358 --> 02:23:12.284
MATT: It's good to ask these things.

02:23:12.284 --> 02:23:20.886
ORION: (laughs) So okay. While the days are going,
I want to roll for animal handling to teach

02:23:20.886 --> 02:23:24.494
Lockheed stuff, which is every morning, whatever.

02:23:24.494 --> 02:23:30.845
MATT: I'll say throughout the week, 'cause you've
taught Lockheed a lot of things back to back. You

02:23:30.845 --> 02:23:36.712
can't cram everything in there in the three to
four days and like: "You learn everything!"

02:23:36.712 --> 02:23:39.857
Because you've already taught Lockheed one thing
this week. Roll for a second thing you want to

02:23:39.857 --> 02:23:41.219
teach Lockheed.

02:23:41.219 --> 02:23:45.955
ORION: Like, with advantage? I'm just having fun.

02:23:45.955 --> 02:23:48.716
MATT: Sure, I'll give you advantage on that.

02:23:48.716 --> 02:23:52.923
ORION: That's fine, that's fine. I'll take that.
That's 17.

02:23:52.923 --> 02:23:55.068
MATT: Roll advantage. Go for it.

02:23:55.068 --> 02:23:56.913
ORION: 17.

02:23:56.913 --> 02:23:59.921
TRAVIS: For the sake of brevity, can I roll one
beard check?

02:23:59.921 --> 02:24:02.214
MATT: Yeah. You can roll several beard checks.

02:24:02.214 --> 02:24:03.442
TRAVIS: 43.

02:24:03.442 --> 02:24:05.507
MATT: 43. It starts filling in.

02:24:05.507 --> 02:24:06.740
TRAVIS: 81.

02:24:06.740 --> 02:24:07.833
MATT: Nope.

02:24:07.833 --> 02:24:09.001
TRAVIS: 86.

02:24:09.001 --> 02:24:10.338
LIAM: Aw, come on Grog.

02:24:10.338 --> 02:24:11.627
TRAVS: 16.

02:24:11.627 --> 02:24:12.748
MATT: 16.

02:24:12.748 --> 02:24:19.831
TRAVIS: 68, 19. 58.

02:24:19.831 --> 02:24:24.459
MATT: Okay. So by the time the week comes to an end, the
other side of your beard has finally filled in and

02:24:24.459 --> 02:24:26.379
you are back to a full beard, Grog.

02:24:26.379 --> 02:24:28.295
LAURA: Good job, Grog.

02:24:28.295 --> 02:24:33.395
MATT: So yeah, that succeeds. It takes you a few
days to get it though, but what do you want to

02:24:33.395 --> 02:24:36.772
teach Lockheed?

02:24:36.772 --> 02:24:39.473
ORION: I want to teach him to be quiet.

02:24:39.473 --> 02:24:47.425
MATT: A very important thing to teach a creature.
So Lockheed has learned to be quiet. Good. Anything

02:24:47.425 --> 02:24:48.490
else?

02:24:48.490 --> 02:24:58.087
ORION: Yes. I got that, that. Throughout the days,
I'm going to go all the shops and see how many

02:24:58.087 --> 02:25:05.727
glass mirrors-- I'm looking for mirrors, just all
kinds of mirrors, every size.

02:25:05.727 --> 02:25:10.809
MATT: There are plenty of mirrors out there. There
are general stores that sell them all over.

02:25:10.809 --> 02:25:14.123
ORION: I'm looking for five-by-five to ten-by-ten
size mirrors.

02:25:14.123 --> 02:25:15.184
SAM: Feet?!

02:25:15.184 --> 02:25:17.534
ORION: Yeah. No, inches.

02:25:17.534 --> 02:25:26.447
MATT: Okay. I misunderstood. Yeah. You could've
had them custom made if they weren't out there,

02:25:26.447 --> 02:25:29.702
but they have mirrors of that size available.

02:25:29.702 --> 02:25:34.506
ORION: I need about 1,500 of them. Can I get
1,500? How many can I get?

02:25:34.506 --> 02:25:37.975
MATT: There aren't that many mirrors in the city.

02:25:37.975 --> 02:25:40.505
ORION: Okay. All of them.

02:25:40.505 --> 02:25:44.096
SAM: You know, if you hold two next to each other
there looks like there's a million of them.

02:25:44.096 --> 02:25:46.046
ORION: You know what, that's true.

02:25:46.046 --> 02:25:53.105
MATT: They're five gold apiece, and of what is
currently available for purchase, you may be able

02:25:53.105 --> 02:25:58.400
to acquire about 35 mirrors, and you'll clean out
most of the places that will stop selling them to

02:25:58.400 --> 02:25:59.432
you.

02:25:59.432 --> 02:26:02.333
LIAM: That's cutting-edge technology in this day
and age.

02:26:02.333 --> 02:26:08.357
ORION: How many, if I laid them out on a flat
surface, how many-- (laughs) How many feet would

02:26:08.357 --> 02:26:11.616
that cover?

02:26:11.616 --> 02:26:19.602
LIAM: Well, two per foot, Tibs. They're five
inches apiece, right? You can fit two in a foot.

02:26:19.602 --> 02:26:22.111
So you just bought 35, so that's about--

02:26:22.111 --> 02:26:27.427
LAURA: 17 feet! 17 whole feet of mirrors!

02:26:27.427 --> 02:26:32.705
SAM: If you're doing a square, it's three feet by
three feet.

02:26:32.705 --> 02:26:36.494
MATT: Yeah, four by four. So there you go. Four by
four.

02:26:36.494 --> 02:26:39.521
ORION: I'll take all that. How much is that?

02:26:39.521 --> 02:26:47.453
MATT: Okay. 35 times five. So we're looking at 175
gold.

02:26:47.453 --> 02:26:59.650
ORION: Done. And then, for timeline stuff, I'm
going to do as much as I can to start enchanting

02:26:59.650 --> 02:27:03.431
my bolts, and I'm going to go work with Keyleth on
stuff.

02:27:03.431 --> 02:27:06.415
MATT: Keyleth's been working with Percy this whole
time.

02:27:06.415 --> 02:27:08.136
MARISHA: The whole time?

02:27:08.136 --> 02:27:11.189
MATT: It's taken the entire week for him, you said
you were assisting him.

02:27:11.189 --> 02:27:14.358
MARISHA: No, you said I couldn't assist him. I had
no intelligence to assist him.

02:27:14.358 --> 02:27:19.053
MATT: I thought you said you were still going to
help cheer him on. Okay, then no worries. Then yeah,

02:27:19.122 --> 02:27:20.095
you're available.

02:27:20.095 --> 02:27:27.019
ORION: I'm going to try to make as many sleep
bolts as I can. But the other thing with Keyleth is I

02:27:27.019 --> 02:27:35.969
would like to enchant a bolt that is a smoke
screen, but it consists of holy water. So I use a

02:27:35.969 --> 02:27:39.846
pour of the day from the canteen and use that as a
mist instead of a smoke.

02:27:39.846 --> 02:27:45.470
MATT: The enchantment of an arrow to do that is
the use of a Fog spell. There is no way to infuse

02:27:45.470 --> 02:27:47.298
a Fog spell with holy water.

02:27:47.298 --> 02:27:50.513
MARISHA: That's what I was saying. I don't know if
you can do holy water. I can do a Fog spell.

02:27:50.513 --> 02:27:52.693
ORION: Can we infuse a Fog spell with a Sleep
spell?

02:27:52.693 --> 02:27:53.857
MATT: No.

02:27:53.857 --> 02:27:55.382
ORION: Can we try super hard?

02:27:55.382 --> 02:27:57.745
MATT: Sure. Make a roll.

02:27:57.745 --> 02:27:59.291
ORION: God damn it. Okay.

02:27:59.291 --> 02:28:01.915
MARISHA: Like, the best I could possibly do is
maybe take one of these holy water things.

02:28:01.915 --> 02:28:03.605
ORION: What am I rolling?

02:28:03.605 --> 02:28:04.718
MATT: Plus arcana.

02:28:04.718 --> 02:28:07.303
TRAVIS: Do you think it matters? No.

02:28:07.303 --> 02:28:08.355
ORION: 24.

02:28:08.355 --> 02:28:14.047
MATT: 24. Okay. After spending approximately 500
gold in materials, the enchantment fails, both

02:28:14.047 --> 02:28:19.819
spells fizzled. You lost 500 gold. But now you
know. Probably can't combine two spells into a

02:28:19.819 --> 02:28:21.150
single enchantment.

02:28:21.150 --> 02:28:23.514
LIAM: And knowing is half the battle.

02:28:23.514 --> 02:28:25.500
ORION: Don't worry, it came out of my pocket.

02:28:25.500 --> 02:28:26.927
SAM: I've got fog.

02:28:26.927 --> 02:28:27.782
ORION: Okay.

02:28:27.782 --> 02:28:30.474
TRAVIS: How about you get nothing else, and we
move on?

02:28:30.474 --> 02:28:31.703
ORION: Last thing.

02:28:31.703 --> 02:28:33.910
TRAVIS: No last thing.

02:28:33.910 --> 02:28:35.379
ORION: I stop at Allura's.

02:28:35.379 --> 02:28:38.815
MATT: You go towards the Cloudtop District, and
the guards stop you again.

02:28:38.815 --> 02:28:45.106
ORION: I remember that as I walk up, and I go back
to Greyskull Keep.

02:28:45.106 --> 02:28:46.472
MATT: All right.

02:28:46.472 --> 02:28:47.867
MARISHA: Oh wait, I don't do that.

02:28:47.867 --> 02:28:48.915
ORION: Oh wait, I don't do that.

02:28:48.915 --> 02:28:50.362
MARISHA: #OrionAcaba.

02:28:50.362 --> 02:28:53.411
ORION: I realize what I'm doing, and I stop.

02:28:53.411 --> 02:28:59.352
LIAM: Also. This will just take ten seconds, at
some point in the week, when Keyleth is taking a

02:28:59.352 --> 02:29:05.093
walk, I go into her garden, and I clip one flower,
and I take it.

02:29:05.093 --> 02:29:11.150
MATT: How many sleep bolts?

02:29:11.150 --> 02:29:16.330
LIAM: Go sleep in your money.

02:29:16.330 --> 02:29:18.694
ORION: You said I could do that.

02:29:18.694 --> 02:29:21.510
TALIESIN: You're busy this week.

02:29:21.510 --> 02:29:26.844
SAM: Can he get back to the keep and we've all
left four days ago?

02:29:26.844 --> 02:29:29.576
(laughter)

02:29:29.576 --> 02:29:35.339
ORION: Carrying groceries in, look, guys: hoagie
stuff!

02:29:35.339 --> 02:29:40.171
SAM: Dear Tiberius. We left.

02:29:40.171 --> 02:29:43.046
LAURA: We got really bored and we left.

02:29:43.046 --> 02:29:52.046
MATT: Okay, I will say for each arrow, it will
cost you 600 gold and will take you six days to

02:29:52.046 --> 02:29:53.527
do, per arrow.

02:29:53.527 --> 02:29:55.014
LAURA: Six days per arrow?

02:29:55.014 --> 02:30:00.734
MATT: Yes. It's one day per 100 gold of an
enchantment. Which is even me making it higher

02:30:00.734 --> 02:30:03.456
than the book says. It should take you four times
that.

02:30:03.456 --> 02:30:06.492
ORION: Cool. Can it cost more if I hire a mage?

02:30:06.492 --> 02:30:09.046
LAURA: (screams)

02:30:09.046 --> 02:30:13.866
MATT: You want to hire a mage?

02:30:13.866 --> 02:30:15.685
MARISHA: I need to do shit, too. I can't be
everyone's bitch.

02:30:15.685 --> 02:30:18.779
MATT: So three and a half days and it cost you
1,200 gold for a single sleep bolt.

02:30:18.779 --> 02:30:21.753
ORION: Sweet. And I do two of those. And I'm
broke.

02:30:21.753 --> 02:30:24.280
LIAM: He's spent people, he's spent.

02:30:24.280 --> 02:30:27.330
MATT: Okay, so you've done all of your
shopping in one day and spent the rest of the week

02:30:27.330 --> 02:30:30.837
doing those. All right, so there we go. You're
broke and you have two sleep bolts on your person.

02:30:30.837 --> 02:30:32.019
Keyleth.

02:30:32.019 --> 02:30:35.083
MARISHA: I got to Gilmore's and I buy an alchemy
set.

02:30:35.083 --> 02:30:40.012
MATT: Okay. That comes to--

02:30:40.012 --> 02:30:42.124
SAM: 95,000 gold

02:30:42.124 --> 02:30:44.915
ORION: It's going to be a lot more than you think,
apparently.

02:30:44.915 --> 02:30:47.882
MATT: Alchemist supplies? 50 gold.

02:30:47.882 --> 02:30:49.263
ORION: Oh, come on!

02:30:49.263 --> 02:30:53.751
MATT: Not enchanted, yo. "It's magic, give me all
the magic!"

02:30:53.751 --> 02:30:56.336
TALIESIN: This is made of things.

02:30:56.336 --> 02:31:02.267
MARISHA: This is made of things. And then I go
home and I make a few Cure Wounds potions. Try it

02:31:02.267 --> 02:31:07.622
out, since I've learned and I've been studying and
I've been doing my research. So maybe a few level

02:31:07.622 --> 02:31:10.154
two, level three Cure Wounds potions?

02:31:10.154 --> 02:31:16.423
MATT: A level two healing potion, a greater
healing potion. The materials involved in creating

02:31:16.423 --> 02:31:23.448
that will come to, I'd say about 400 apiece, and
you'd have time to create two. It's about four

02:31:23.448 --> 02:31:25.225
days per potion.

02:31:25.225 --> 02:31:26.948
SAM: (whispered) How much do they cost?

02:31:26.948 --> 02:31:32.485
MATT: To purchase? They cost about 500 to 600.
She's getting a discount because she's making it

02:31:32.485 --> 02:31:33.685
herself.

02:31:33.685 --> 02:31:37.443
MARISHA: Wait, they cost 500 to 600 and they cost
400 for me to make them?

02:31:37.443 --> 02:31:42.785
MATT: Yes. It's your first time doing it. They'll
probably get cheaper over time as you get better

02:31:42.785 --> 02:31:44.057
at it.

02:31:44.057 --> 02:31:50.301
MARISHA: Oh, okay. Cheaper over time as I get
better at it? That's funsies. Well, let me make--

02:31:50.301 --> 02:31:52.899
What is that? A greater healing potion?

02:31:52.899 --> 02:31:57.207
MATT: It's a greater healing. So for each one you
make, roll a d20 and add five.

02:31:57.207 --> 02:31:59.047
MARISHA: Let me make one for right now.

02:31:59.047 --> 02:32:00.485
MATT: Okay.

02:32:00.485 --> 02:32:03.218
MARISHA: That's an 18. That's pretty good.

02:32:03.218 --> 02:32:05.518
MATT: Then yeah, you successfully create the
potion. No issue.

02:32:05.518 --> 02:32:16.714
MARISHA: Awesome. I had a Percy-roll! And he hates
me for it. How long will it take me to make a

02:32:16.714 --> 02:32:18.182
Daylight scroll?

02:32:18.182 --> 02:32:20.612
MATT: A Daylight scroll? What level spell is
that?

02:32:20.612 --> 02:32:21.874
MARISHA: Third.

02:32:21.874 --> 02:32:30.999
MATT: Third? That'll cost you about, I'd say, 600
gold pieces. It'll take you six days. You don't

02:32:31.032 --> 02:32:34.699
have time. You could pay more to have somebody else
help you make one if you wanted to.

02:32:34.699 --> 02:32:39.692
MARISHA: Then I make two greater healing potions.
Actually, no, I want to experiment. I want to take

02:32:39.692 --> 02:32:52.054
one of those holy water bottles. And I want to see
if I can enchant it with my Fog spell. To make it a

02:32:52.054 --> 02:32:58.895
holy water fog grenade. When you throw it, it'll
go (shatters) with my fog spell.

02:32:58.895 --> 02:33:08.761
MATT: You know that upon throwing the holy water,
it would shatter. It would create a fog, but the

02:33:08.761 --> 02:33:14.490
holy water itself would just affect the creature
you threw it at. You'd be able to blend the two

02:33:14.490 --> 02:33:19.237
enchantments; they don't necessarily mix. The fog
itself is not created from the water, it's created

02:33:19.237 --> 02:33:21.579
from the glass that you're enchanting.

02:33:21.579 --> 02:33:25.169
LAURA: Plus, we didn't get any holy water, we only
got holy oil to put on our weapons.

02:33:25.169 --> 02:33:26.993
MATT: You have a couple of flasks of holy water.

02:33:26.993 --> 02:33:35.780
MARISHA: What if I enchant it with Daylight? Oh
wait, it still won't--

02:33:35.780 --> 02:33:39.912
MATT: It's a whole different thing. Daylight,
that's more of a scroll thing.

02:33:39.912 --> 02:33:44.216
MARISHA: I'm going to do it, anyway. I'm going to
do the fog thing, because I said it. I'm going to

02:33:44.216 --> 02:33:45.195
commit.

02:33:45.195 --> 02:33:54.222
MATT: Okay. That will cost you-- I'll put it at
500 gold pieces. And that'll take you five days.

02:33:54.222 --> 02:33:56.393
ORION: For a fog scroll?

02:33:56.393 --> 02:34:02.851
MARISHA: No, for the fog holy water thing. It's a
holy smoke grenade.

02:34:02.851 --> 02:34:07.068
LIAM: Someday, we will get out of the character
creation menu, but not this day.

02:34:07.068 --> 02:34:10.697
TALIESIN: I don't like the nose yet. It's too
low.

02:34:10.697 --> 02:34:12.646
MARISHA: Sure. That'll be my two things I do.

02:34:12.646 --> 02:34:15.113
MATT: Okay, roll another d20. Plus five.

02:34:15.113 --> 02:34:17.015
MARISHA: Natural 20.

02:34:17.015 --> 02:34:24.611
MATT: All right. You feel the fog enchantment take
shape in the glass vial. It seems relatively

02:34:24.611 --> 02:34:34.327
unstable. You gather that this glass was not meant
to contain an enchantment from the get-go. You

02:34:34.327 --> 02:34:37.832
somehow manage to make it function, but you have
to be very careful with that vial.

02:34:37.832 --> 02:34:39.415
ORION: Here, put it in here.

02:34:39.415 --> 02:34:42.374
MATT: Who knows what'll happen if it actually is
thrown?

02:34:42.374 --> 02:34:44.157
LAURA: Don't put it in a Bag of Holding.

02:34:44.157 --> 02:34:45.699
LIAM: Give it to Scanlan.

02:34:45.699 --> 02:34:47.905
MARISHA: Who would like a very unstable item?

02:34:47.905 --> 02:34:50.809
LAURA: Percy's used to unstable things.

02:34:50.809 --> 02:34:52.479
MARISHA: I give it to Scanlan.

02:34:52.479 --> 02:34:54.258
TALIESIN: Was that a jab at my-- No, never mind.

02:34:54.258 --> 02:34:57.635
MATT: It's a fog-enchanted vial of holy water. You
can write it down that way if you'd like.

02:34:57.635 --> 02:35:03.922
SAM: I'll just put it on my back. I'll just hang
it.

02:35:03.922 --> 02:35:15.082
MARISHA: Please be careful. Wait, I tell him.
Scanlan, this is very delicate. Please be very

02:35:15.082 --> 02:35:16.220
gentle with this.

02:35:16.220 --> 02:35:21.075
SAM: I will put it where I put all gentle things.

02:35:21.075 --> 02:35:24.645
MARISHA: That I trust. I trust that more. Fine.
Good.

02:35:24.645 --> 02:35:28.291
ORION: You do not make the wisest decisions here
your Majesty, I must say.

02:35:28.291 --> 02:35:30.333
MATT: What was once holy--

02:35:30.333 --> 02:35:34.027
(laughter)

02:35:34.027 --> 02:35:35.456
MATT: All right.

02:35:35.456 --> 02:35:36.678
TALIESIN: Oh god.

02:35:36.678 --> 02:35:41.250
SAM: I give everyone the chainmail.

02:35:41.250 --> 02:35:43.272
MATT: Okay. You give all the chainmail.

02:35:43.272 --> 02:35:45.286
LAURA: Oh. Look at this, so fancy.

02:35:45.286 --> 02:35:51.106
SAM: I take that fancy box I bought a couple times
ago, and I take the blue crystal that we found in

02:35:51.106 --> 02:35:58.614
our very first adventure and I put it in and I
seal it tight. Shit. I had one more thing I wanted

02:35:58.614 --> 02:36:05.217
to do. Oh yes, I drink my Shit-Scrying Potion,
shit in a jar and leave it in the kitchen. And

02:36:05.217 --> 02:36:09.789
tell the help, don't touch it.

02:36:09.789 --> 02:36:15.010
MATT: Okay. (laughs) It takes much convincing, but
nevertheless they acquiesce to your request, being

02:36:15.010 --> 02:36:19.390
the boss. All right. Anything else?

02:36:19.390 --> 02:36:24.791
TALIESIN: Yeah. Just going to let the guards know
to watch our guest while we're away. Keep him

02:36:24.791 --> 02:36:26.568
under protection.

02:36:26.568 --> 02:36:28.463
TRAVIS: Are we leaving him here?

02:36:28.463 --> 02:36:29.766
TALIESIN: I think so.

02:36:29.766 --> 02:36:31.119
LAURA: Oh god.

02:36:31.119 --> 02:36:32.237
MATT: The what?

02:36:32.237 --> 02:36:36.281
ORION: The guy who built stuff, regardless, did I
do that or is that just in my head?

02:36:36.281 --> 02:36:38.643
MATT: Lord Daxio, you mean? What about him?

02:36:38.643 --> 02:36:41.635
ORION: So I didn't do that yet.

02:36:41.635 --> 02:36:44.133
TRAVIS: Yeah, you going to do something on his
room, Keyleth?

02:36:44.133 --> 02:37:00.869
LAURA: I go find Jarett, and I give him 200 gold.
And I say, do not let-- Desmond? Leave your side.

02:37:00.869 --> 02:37:07.579
Watch him, watch for invisible anything. Protect
him with everything you can.

02:37:07.579 --> 02:37:09.925
MATT: "I will do this with my life. Do not
worry."

02:37:09.925 --> 02:37:11.678
SAM: Have we given them a raise?

02:37:11.678 --> 02:37:13.383
LAURA: I just gave him 200 fucking gold.

02:37:13.383 --> 02:37:15.008
TRAVIS: Double the guard on him.

02:37:15.008 --> 02:37:22.587
LAURA: And yeah, everybody-- fuck. I give a
hundred--

02:37:22.587 --> 02:37:25.803
SAM: Five of them make 100 a month, two of them
make 50 a month.

02:37:25.803 --> 02:37:34.962
LAURA: I give another 200 to him and tell him to
pass it out to the rest of the guard. We'll be

02:37:34.962 --> 02:37:36.247
back soon!

02:37:36.247 --> 02:37:40.319
MATT: "Very generous, and I think they'll be very
happy to find this. Thank you very much."

02:37:40.319 --> 02:37:43.643
LAURA: And add another guard to the watch.

02:37:43.643 --> 02:37:47.426
TRAVIS: Two to Desmond. At all times.

02:37:47.426 --> 02:37:51.051
MATT: "Very well. I will do this. Thank you."

02:37:51.051 --> 02:37:52.384
LAURA: Thank you.

02:37:52.384 --> 02:37:59.138
ORION: I going to tell Erwen to go and ask for
court for the lord that can construct and tell him

02:37:59.138 --> 02:38:05.062
that we would like to make some changes and have
the cells converted into barracks for our

02:38:05.062 --> 02:38:06.064
soldiers.

02:38:06.064 --> 02:38:07.727
SAM: That won't do anything.

02:38:07.727 --> 02:38:10.002
ORION: That's what I do. That's what Tiberius
does.

02:38:10.002 --> 02:38:13.930
MATT: Okay. Erwen goes, "All right, sir." And he
wanders off.

02:38:13.930 --> 02:38:18.112
ORION: Getting a good reputation does not mean
holding prison cells.

02:38:18.145 --> 02:38:22.488
MATT: About an hour later Erwen returns and says, "I'm
sorry. They would not allow me into the central

02:38:22.488 --> 02:38:29.986
"district. I do not have the proper papers to pass
within. I mentioned that I worked for you, and

02:38:29.986 --> 02:38:33.087
"they told me I was not to enter."

02:38:33.087 --> 02:38:35.493
ORION: Oh, maybe you should have said a different
name.

02:38:35.493 --> 02:38:38.220
SAM: They would have known when they got to our
keep.

02:38:38.220 --> 02:38:39.862
ORION: That's true. (laughs)

02:38:39.862 --> 02:38:41.233
LAURA: Shall we head out?

02:38:41.233 --> 02:38:42.366
TALIESIN: Yes.

02:38:42.366 --> 02:38:44.617
LAURA: Did I learn anything from Seeker Asum?

02:38:44.752 --> 02:38:47.915
MATT: Go ahead and roll a d20, adding your wisdom
modifier.

02:38:47.915 --> 02:38:49.537
LAURA: Ah jeez, really?

02:38:49.537 --> 02:38:51.208
LIAM: Come on, Laura.

02:38:51.208 --> 02:38:52.738
LAURA: What if I roll like shit?

02:38:52.738 --> 02:38:57.892
LIAM: Then it'll be hilarious. Roll that die. Come
on. Roll high and it will be amazing.

02:38:57.892 --> 02:39:00.889
MATT: Make it with advantage, because Asum is a
very good teacher.

02:39:00.889 --> 02:39:02.503
LAURA: He is. He's so good.

02:39:02.503 --> 02:39:03.830
SAM: He's awesome.

02:39:03.830 --> 02:39:05.850
LAURA: (fake crying) No, that was terrible.

02:39:05.850 --> 02:39:07.345
MARISHA: Advantage!

02:39:07.345 --> 02:39:10.197
LIAM: You are playing DND right now! All right.

02:39:10.197 --> 02:39:15.024
LAURA: Plus my wisdom. 17.

02:39:15.024 --> 02:39:17.603
MATT: 17, okay.

02:39:17.603 --> 02:39:19.521
LIAM: Is she an emperor now?

02:39:19.521 --> 02:39:27.666
MATT: (laughs) Is that how this works? All right,
so talking with Asum. He works with you for a bit

02:39:27.666 --> 02:39:31.786
and teaches you the ranger ability Skirmisher's
Stealth.

02:39:31.786 --> 02:39:34.157
SAM: Skirmisher's Stealth?

02:39:34.157 --> 02:39:46.329
MATT: So if you start one of your turns hidden
from a creature, you can then, as a bonus action

02:39:46.329 --> 02:39:50.520
at the end of your turn, make another stealth
check to remain hidden from them. You essentially

02:39:50.520 --> 02:39:53.990
can dive between areas and still be hidden.

02:39:53.990 --> 02:39:55.637
LAURA: While I'm attacking?

02:39:55.637 --> 02:39:57.493
LIAM: That's all ranger stuff?

02:39:57.493 --> 02:39:58.806
LAURA: Cool.

02:39:58.806 --> 02:40:02.527
LIAM and SAM: (air horn noises)

02:40:02.527 --> 02:40:06.822
MATT: So yeah. We'll go over the details of it
after the game. Essentially, you learn a new

02:40:06.822 --> 02:40:08.950
ranger ability from Seeker Asum.

02:40:08.950 --> 02:40:09.989
MARISHA: Dope.

02:40:09.989 --> 02:40:11.635
LIAM: Wow. I bought some sticks.

02:40:11.635 --> 02:40:13.222
MATT: All right.

02:40:13.222 --> 02:40:18.358
ORION: At the end of the first day, before all of
that stuff happens. Sorry, guys, this is

02:40:18.358 --> 02:40:19.357
necessary.

02:40:19.357 --> 02:40:20.942
TRAVIS: Is it?

02:40:20.942 --> 02:40:28.150
LIAM: Everybody shut up and let Grog go on a one
man, solo kill spree.

02:40:28.150 --> 02:40:31.153
TRAVIS: It's bound to happen. He's going to
secede.

02:40:31.153 --> 02:40:35.436
MATT: Tiberius, what do you want to do?

02:40:35.436 --> 02:40:40.789
ORION: I'm in my lab the first night and I write a
Scroll of Telescription to my father. And I go,

02:40:40.789 --> 02:40:45.163
dear father, and I tell him about the circumstances 
with the vampires.

02:40:45.163 --> 02:40:47.961
LAURA: Dear diary. Sorry.

02:40:47.961 --> 02:40:55.569
ORION: At the end of it I go: I invoke the
ambassador's right of war time as of now, and

02:40:55.569 --> 02:41:02.143
moreover as your son when I provide concrete
evidence, you will know. But in the meantime, I

02:41:02.143 --> 02:41:07.164
would have you gather 50 ground troops of the
Draconian knights and 50 winged soldiers of the

02:41:07.164 --> 02:41:11.629
wyvern fleet. Have them at the ready for my
signal. I know it will take you a few days of

02:41:11.629 --> 02:41:17.788
travel to get here, but this is a town of vampires
and possibly liches, which you know need to be

02:41:17.788 --> 02:41:22.138
destroyed no matter what. Your son, with love,
Tiberius.

02:41:22.138 --> 02:41:23.470
MATT: All right.

02:41:23.470 --> 02:41:29.472
LAURA: Everyone is aware that Tiberius is the
giant eagles in Lord of the Rings. Tiberius can

02:41:29.472 --> 02:41:34.932
invoke ultimate destruction at the call of whatever
he wants.

02:41:34.932 --> 02:41:36.942
ORION: I don't know what's going on over there.

02:41:36.942 --> 02:41:41.721
MATT: All right. As the week comes to a close,
eventually a note appears before you, Tiberius,

02:41:41.721 --> 02:41:52.180
within your magical room. (fluttering) It reads:
"Tiberius, child. I understand your request.

02:41:52.180 --> 02:42:01.616
"However, you are fresh to these political matters
and as the young one prone to jump at the sight of

02:42:01.616 --> 02:42:08.769
"a shadow, I would need some very heavy proof to
invoke wartime. Which, if I might add, is not your

02:42:08.769 --> 02:42:15.293
"jurisdiction, but my own. Should you wish to bring
this to my attention, you are welcome to, but you

02:42:15.293 --> 02:42:24.333
"have but one chance before I set aside this
intrusion to my work time as mere poppycock."

02:42:24.333 --> 02:42:29.773
(laughter)

02:42:29.773 --> 02:42:40.605
MATT: "Tiberius, I trust that in time you will
prove yourself to this family and to this country,

02:42:40.605 --> 02:42:46.005
"but for the time being, business matters of this
larger scale are best left to those with

02:42:46.005 --> 02:42:50.038
"experience. With love, Kruvanis Stormwind."

02:42:50.038 --> 02:42:52.446
LIAM: (whispers) Send him three more letters.

02:42:52.446 --> 02:43:03.192
ORION: Damn it. Have to provide proof to my
fucking father. Fine. He didn't say no, which is

02:43:03.192 --> 02:43:07.152
what he always says. Which is a lot better than
what he always says.

02:43:07.152 --> 02:43:12.781
SAM: I walk into Tiberius' room while he's having
this conversation with himself. And I say, what

02:43:12.781 --> 02:43:14.261
are you doing in here?

02:43:14.261 --> 02:43:15.727
ORION: I'm talking to myself, Scanlan.

02:43:15.727 --> 02:43:19.684
SAM: Oh, okay. All right. I'm going to go get some
garlic from the kitchen, and then let's go!

02:43:19.684 --> 02:43:30.551
LAURA: I write a note. Address it to Uriel, hand
it to our main butler. Who I know his name.

02:43:30.551 --> 02:43:31.710
MATT: Erwen.

02:43:31.710 --> 02:43:42.799
LAURA: Erwen. It basically says: Uriel, FYI, we
didn't totally flee. We's looking for evidence.

02:43:42.859 --> 02:43:48.485
No, we didn't flee. We'll be back, how about that?
We'll be back.

02:43:48.485 --> 02:43:50.456
MATT: All right. The note is left with Erwen.

02:43:50.456 --> 02:43:55.020
LAURA: And I tell him, only give this to anybody
if they come looking for us and they're angry.

02:43:55.020 --> 02:43:58.807
MATT: "Yes, of course. Of course."

02:43:58.807 --> 02:44:09.164
MARISHA: Grog? Do you think I should do the whole
elemental guardian thing?

02:44:09.164 --> 02:44:10.694
TRAVIS: Why not?

02:44:10.694 --> 02:44:12.017
MARISHA: All right.

02:44:12.017 --> 02:44:13.434
ORION: How are you doing, Grog?

02:44:13.434 --> 02:44:14.721
TRAVIS: I'm fucking bored.

02:44:14.721 --> 02:44:17.793
(laughter)

02:44:17.793 --> 02:44:21.890
TRAVIS: I've been sitting here for 30 fucking
minutes. I'm bored! Cast an elemental and make it

02:44:21.890 --> 02:44:24.479
smash everything around the keep.

02:44:24.479 --> 02:44:33.490
MARISHA: Give me that ruby. (ting) I catch it.
Water elemental seems appropriate based on our

02:44:33.490 --> 02:44:43.410
knowledge, yeah? Water elemental. And Planar
Binding. And I talk to him in my elemental speech,

02:44:43.410 --> 02:44:45.045
which I can do.

02:44:45.045 --> 02:44:48.887
TALIESIN: And you say? (gargles water during
Marisha's speech)

02:44:48.887 --> 02:45:01.385
MARISHA: And I say, look, we're going to be gone
for 30 days. We have a visitor here. Make sure

02:45:01.385 --> 02:45:06.478
nothing or no one brings him any harm.

02:45:06.478 --> 02:45:09.350
(laughter)

02:45:09.350 --> 02:45:12.050
MATT: I don't have a drink.

02:45:12.050 --> 02:45:14.318
ORION: That make you thirsty?

02:45:14.318 --> 02:45:19.303
TALIESIN: You know, you can speak English, you
don't have to--

02:45:19.303 --> 02:45:25.627
MATT: Yeah. The elemental gives you an acknowledgment
and speaks back in its own tongue the equivalent

02:45:25.627 --> 02:45:28.581
of, for my time here, I serve.

02:45:28.581 --> 02:45:30.480
MARISHA: Wait, what? I'm sorry.

02:45:30.480 --> 02:45:33.614
MATT: "For my time here, I serve" is essentially
the essence of what you get from him

02:45:33.614 --> 02:45:34.837
MARISHA: For my time here, I serve?

02:45:34.837 --> 02:45:37.154
MATT: For my time here, I serve. All right.

02:45:37.154 --> 02:45:38.206
SAM: Onward.

02:45:38.206 --> 02:45:40.249
LIAM: I love doing this show.

02:45:40.249 --> 02:45:42.489
(laughter)

02:45:42.489 --> 02:45:46.479
SAM: Do we know where we're going?

02:45:46.479 --> 02:45:48.851
TALIESIN: Yeah, I know where we're going.

02:45:48.851 --> 02:45:53.629
LIAM: Percival de Rolo knows where we're going to
go.

02:45:53.629 --> 02:45:55.273
TALIESIN: We head to Turst Fields.

02:45:55.273 --> 02:46:00.137
MARISHA: Are we riding there by horseback? Is that
what we're doing?

02:46:00.137 --> 02:46:05.218
SAM: Do we know where we're going?

02:46:05.218 --> 02:46:10.158
MATT: Well, Percy said the Turst Fields. The Turst
Fields you do know. Some of you may have passed by

02:46:10.158 --> 02:46:15.268
them. They are to the east, northeast area of
Westruun, on the eastern side of the continent.

02:46:15.268 --> 02:46:21.352
It's about four and a half days' travel horseback.

02:46:21.352 --> 02:46:23.783
TRAVIS: What if we purchased a carriage?

02:46:23.783 --> 02:46:28.659
ORION: What if we went on airship instead? We have
one at our disposal, do we not?

02:46:28.659 --> 02:46:32.050
MARISHA: Well, we had one at our disposal when we
were friends of the city.

02:46:32.050 --> 02:46:34.666
LAURA: I think it's in the Cloudtop District,
actually.

02:46:34.666 --> 02:46:41.267
LIAM: I think we need to go on the down-low.

02:46:41.267 --> 02:46:44.294
MARISHA: Yeah, let's not tell anybody that we're
leaving.

02:46:44.294 --> 02:46:48.893
SAM: Carriage. Let's go. How much do they cost?

02:46:48.893 --> 02:46:52.905
MARISHA: Do we need a carriage? We have a stable
full of horses.

02:46:52.905 --> 02:46:55.560
LIAM: Rein it in. We're going to fight vampires.

02:46:55.560 --> 02:47:01.529
MATT: You have four horses, and you technically
have the teleportation sigil for Westruun.

02:47:01.529 --> 02:47:02.917
LAURA: Oh yeah!

02:47:02.917 --> 02:47:04.888
ORION: Is Briarwood keep over there?

02:47:04.888 --> 02:47:07.681
MATT: Westruun's most of the way across the
continent. It's about a day's ride out from

02:47:07.681 --> 02:47:08.729
Westruun.

02:47:08.729 --> 02:47:10.047
MARISHA: So that would shave time?

02:47:10.047 --> 02:47:11.687
MATT: It would shave about three days off your
journey.

02:47:11.687 --> 02:47:13.601
LIAM: Matt, I'm pretty sure it's "si-google."

02:47:13.601 --> 02:47:19.497
TALIESIN: Turst Fields is just northeast of
Westruun.

02:47:19.497 --> 02:47:21.055
LAURA: Let's do it!

02:47:21.055 --> 02:47:23.189
LIAM: What's in those fields?

02:47:23.189 --> 02:47:29.484
MATT: The Turst Fields are a farming community
that takes care of a lot of the eastern side.

02:47:29.484 --> 02:47:34.796
They're not really an extension of Westruun, but
it's one of the closest cities. And they do a lot

02:47:34.796 --> 02:47:37.927
of food trade up into Whitestone, or did
previously.

02:47:37.927 --> 02:47:40.116
TALIESIN: It's where we would make our camp.

02:47:40.116 --> 02:47:45.493
MARISHA: Let's head there and make camp. And maybe
talk about a plan.

02:47:45.493 --> 02:47:54.135
LIAM: Yes. I think, Percival, you're leading the
way. Use my sister as an advisor, but you're

02:47:54.135 --> 02:47:55.957
leading the way right now.

02:47:55.957 --> 02:48:02.724
TALIESIN: I'm going to draw out a crude map while
we make our way so I can let you all know where

02:48:02.724 --> 02:48:03.824
we're going.

02:48:03.824 --> 02:48:06.381
ORION: Well, then join me in my laboratory,
everyone.

02:48:06.381 --> 02:48:08.909
SAM: All right, yes. We go to Tiberius's
laboratory.

02:48:08.909 --> 02:48:13.285
MATT: Okay. Tiberius, you go ahead and cast
Teleportation Circle.

02:48:13.285 --> 02:48:18.927
ORION: Not yet. I go, hey, look at the laboratory,
guys. What do you think? Scanlan, it looks like

02:48:18.927 --> 02:48:20.262
you're impressed.

02:48:20.262 --> 02:48:22.213
SAM: (dryly) Oh, I'm very impressed.

02:48:22.213 --> 02:48:23.893
MATT: Now you cast Circle of Teleportation.

02:48:23.893 --> 02:48:27.233
ORION: I use my sigil there. I got it set up
there.

02:48:27.233 --> 02:48:33.342
MATT: Yep, and the circle appears. You guys rush
through it. You do not have your horses with you

02:48:33.342 --> 02:48:36.903
because they would not be able to travel through
the teleportation circle with you. However, you

02:48:36.903 --> 02:48:44.447
could probably procure some while you're in
Westruun. In doing that, you guys, for the case of

02:48:44.447 --> 02:48:47.534
brevity on this-- we've been missing that for a
lot of this session.

02:48:47.534 --> 02:48:49.189
LIAM: Let's do this in real time.

02:48:49.189 --> 02:48:58.132
MATT: We'll say the total gold to purchase horses
for the whole party--

02:48:58.132 --> 02:49:01.711
LAURA: After I haggled. Because let's be honest, I
would've.

02:49:01.711 --> 02:49:03.792
MATT: You would've. Go ahead and make a persuasion
roll.

02:49:03.792 --> 02:49:05.219
TRAVIS: You would've.

02:49:05.219 --> 02:49:07.343
ORION: Even in real time.

02:49:07.343 --> 02:49:08.460
MARISHA: Do it.

02:49:08.460 --> 02:49:12.389
LAURA: 21.

02:49:12.389 --> 02:49:22.553
MATT: 21? Okay, yeah, would put you at about,
we'll say because you are renowned in this area

02:49:22.553 --> 02:49:27.807
and you've helped Westruun. Helped them during the
Winter's Crest Festival the year before, using

02:49:27.807 --> 02:49:33.042
that discount. You manage to procure everyone's
horses, including your warhorse, for 210 gold,

02:49:33.042 --> 02:49:35.722
which is a pretty decent discount.

02:49:35.722 --> 02:49:41.031
LAURA: Yes it is. All right.

02:49:41.031 --> 02:49:42.869
TALIESIN: Can I share my map?

02:49:42.869 --> 02:49:44.383
MATT: You can, yeah.

02:49:44.383 --> 02:49:46.751
LAURA: (gasps) You made a map?

02:49:46.751 --> 02:49:48.785
SAM: You drew that just now?

02:49:48.785 --> 02:49:52.989
TALIESIN: You know I've forged all of our
documents? You are aware of that, right? Any time

02:49:52.989 --> 02:49:54.570
we've needed papers.

02:49:54.570 --> 02:49:58.571
LAURA: Wait, where is Westruun? Oh, there's
Westruun, that's where we are right now. So we

02:49:58.571 --> 02:50:05.559
have to go-- I just spit on your map, Percy. Up
through the woods, into the mountains. Whitestone

02:50:05.559 --> 02:50:06.887
is mountains.

02:50:06.887 --> 02:50:08.127
LIAM: You can handle that.

02:50:08.127 --> 02:50:09.729
LAURA: Yeah, I can handle both.

02:50:09.729 --> 02:50:12.532
TRAVIS: We're here, and we've got to go here.

02:50:12.532 --> 02:50:14.057
LAURA: Right.

02:50:14.057 --> 02:50:15.719
SAM: Let's set out.

02:50:15.719 --> 02:50:24.218
MATT: You have two paths. You have the path into
the center of the Parchwood Woods that leads up

02:50:24.218 --> 02:50:30.094
into the valley of the Alabaster Sierras that
surround it. That is the direct route to

02:50:30.094 --> 02:50:36.322
Whitestone that leads through the main pathway.
The forest to the front of the city. There's also

02:50:36.322 --> 02:50:40.818
the Alabaster Sierras themselves, which surround
that peninsula that extends into the northern part

02:50:40.818 --> 02:50:48.358
of the continent. They are very tall, fjord-like,
craggy mountain ranges up against the sea along

02:50:48.358 --> 02:50:53.892
the edge. They're a little more treacherous, but a
little more out of the way; a backdoor route. So

02:50:53.892 --> 02:50:55.664
you guys choose which route you want to take.

02:50:55.664 --> 02:50:57.341
TALIESIN: I would prefer not the direct route.

02:50:57.341 --> 02:50:59.207
ORION: Always go in the backdoor.

02:50:59.207 --> 02:51:02.689
TALIESIN: Can you say that anything that is not
laced with sexual innuendo?

02:51:02.689 --> 02:51:14.824
LAURA: Mountain ranges are part of my favored
terrain. We don't get disadvantage traveling

02:51:14.824 --> 02:51:15.847
through.

02:51:15.847 --> 02:51:19.252
TALIESIN: I would prefer taking that direction. I
don't want to head straight towards them.

02:51:19.252 --> 02:51:22.718
LAURA: There probably will be mountain giants,
though, remember, that throw boulders and they

02:51:22.718 --> 02:51:24.018
will be terrible.

02:51:24.018 --> 02:51:27.960
TALIESIN: The Parchwood Forests are dangerous as
they are. There's really no safe way.

02:51:27.960 --> 02:51:29.732
SAM: I trust Percy; whatever you say.

02:51:29.732 --> 02:51:34.601
MATT: Percy, you are aware that here have been
problems in the past with various mountain-faring

02:51:34.601 --> 02:51:38.688
giants that lived north of Whitestone that
occasionally would wander too far south. They

02:51:38.688 --> 02:51:43.198
mostly kept to themselves, but occasionally they
had some crossover, there were some scuffles here

02:51:43.198 --> 02:51:48.538
and there. So you guys are deciding to take the
Alabaster Sierras?

02:51:48.538 --> 02:51:51.155
LAURA: Yes. I want to cast Pass Without a Trace on
everyone.

02:51:51.155 --> 02:51:57.071
MATT: You guys head out from Westruun; it takes
about a day's worth of travel. You stop in the

02:51:57.071 --> 02:52:04.725
Turst Fields. It's a small farming community. You
ask around for a bit, most of the folks there say

02:52:04.725 --> 02:52:09.543
that they haven't had much trade or communication
with Whitestone like they used to. They do still

02:52:09.543 --> 02:52:14.484
provide crops and such, but they don't allow
anyone past into the actual forest. They trade at

02:52:14.484 --> 02:52:21.712
the boundary created by the forest. Still pay
gold, but it seems to be more enclosed scenario,

02:52:21.712 --> 02:52:25.765
but very few folks there seem to question it.
Business as usual is still left within Turst

02:52:25.765 --> 02:52:27.134
Fields.

02:52:27.134 --> 02:52:35.083
Make your way northward to the bottom of the
Alabaster Sierras, and as you begin heading up the

02:52:35.083 --> 02:52:40.808
outskirts of this mountain range, you do notice
that the mountains are extremely high in altitude.

02:52:40.808 --> 02:52:45.958
There's a perpetual climb at nearly a 40-degree
angle as you continue upward further and further

02:52:45.958 --> 02:52:54.193
and further. The drop-off at the edge of the cliff
is 1,000 to 2,000 feet at times, straight down

02:52:54.193 --> 02:53:00.697
into the ocean or rocks below. There are paths
worn up here; it has been used as travel before.

02:53:00.697 --> 02:53:08.044
Although you're uncertain as to how recently it
may have been traversed. Occasionally, the wind

02:53:08.044 --> 02:53:12.006
picks up and you have to steel yourself, push
yourself against the side. The path, thankfully,

02:53:12.006 --> 02:53:16.794
is maybe 15, 20, sometimes 30 feet in width. It's
not too much where you're being forced against the

02:53:16.794 --> 02:53:20.411
edge, but it's enough to be aware of the danger of
the circumstance.

02:53:20.411 --> 02:53:29.865
You guys are heading up, I'd say, about half a
day's travel, it's about 2:00 in the afternoon.

02:53:29.865 --> 02:53:39.855
Also, you can tell there are slight outcroppings a
few hundred feet down to the bottom, a few bits of

02:53:39.855 --> 02:53:44.654
stone that jut out from the side. You can see
small nests or bushes that have taken root on

02:53:44.654 --> 02:53:52.755
those side areas. The rock itself of this mountain
range is unusually, unnaturally white. The actual

02:53:52.755 --> 02:54:00.636
rock that forms this entire region is almost a
glowing quartz-like texture. There are parts that

02:54:00.636 --> 02:54:05.839
are almost translucent, there are parts that are
very milky white. Number one, you can now

02:54:05.839 --> 02:54:12.054
understand as to partially why the area is called
Whitestone, the town nearby, and you've heard

02:54:12.054 --> 02:54:16.361
mention from Percy in the past of the large
quarries here that mine the stone for various uses

02:54:16.361 --> 02:54:21.035
and export it throughout all of Tal'Dorei. That's
where a large portion of the town was built around

02:54:21.035 --> 02:54:23.957
that trade at the beginning of its construction.

02:54:23.957 --> 02:54:31.038
Eventually, you come to a point where there is a
falloff on the path, where the erosion or some

02:54:31.038 --> 02:54:38.328
sort of large impact of the side caused the path
to fall into a scooped crevasse that is a smooth

02:54:38.328 --> 02:54:44.383
fall down the side. There is no way across other
than a large sea salt air-rotted rope bridge that

02:54:44.383 --> 02:54:51.197
goes across about a hundred feet. You see it
rocking (creaking) with the wind.

02:54:51.197 --> 02:54:56.829
TRAVIS: I don't think this looks very stable.

02:54:56.829 --> 02:55:02.724
LAURA: Man, you know what I would give for a
flying fucking carpet right now?

02:55:02.724 --> 02:55:05.595
SAM: So the bridge is out?

02:55:05.595 --> 02:55:10.930
MATT: No, the bridge can be crossed. It looks a
little rickety. It's not terrible or frightening,

02:55:10.930 --> 02:55:14.869
but it's been there for a while, and you can tell
from the color of the rope--

02:55:14.869 --> 02:55:16.943
SAM: How far is it across?

02:55:16.943 --> 02:55:18.413
MATT: A hundred feet.

02:55:18.413 --> 02:55:20.221
ORION: Should I go first, everyone?

02:55:20.221 --> 02:55:24.297
TALIESIN: I want to inspect it from an engineering
perspective, if that's possible.

02:55:24.297 --> 02:55:28.504
MATT: Go ahead and make an investigation check.

02:55:28.504 --> 02:55:29.874
TALIESIN: Ten.

02:55:29.874 --> 02:55:36.111
MATT: Okay. Looking at it, I mean, the anchors are
pretty solid in the stonework. There's no

02:55:36.111 --> 02:55:41.017
looseness to their element. The rope itself is
taut and seems to have serviced long enough. There

02:55:41.017 --> 02:55:44.848
are no signs of extreme wear other than just time
and weather.

02:55:44.848 --> 02:55:46.854
LIAM: I'm going to walk forward.

02:55:46.854 --> 02:55:50.419
LAURA: I'm going to tie the fucking rope around
your waist before you do that.

02:55:50.419 --> 02:55:52.389
TALIESIN: That's quite a good idea!

02:55:52.389 --> 02:55:59.777
LIAM: Sarenrae, jeepers. I'm going to use
perception, I'm going to look at it before going

02:55:59.777 --> 02:56:04.840
out. That is a 23.

02:56:04.840 --> 02:56:07.537
MATT: All right. Are you taking your horse with
you?

02:56:07.537 --> 02:56:15.141
LIAM: I leave my horse with my sister. I'm on
foot; I'm on all fours, really. Spidering out.

02:56:15.141 --> 02:56:21.567
MATT: Making your way across, you get halfway across the
bridge. There's a creaking sound and slight

02:56:21.567 --> 02:56:25.486
movement as the wind picks up at times and you
(creaking).

02:56:25.486 --> 02:56:33.384
LIAM: So I'm lasting. What would I make, is it an
insight check to decide if I thought Grog could

02:56:33.384 --> 02:56:35.533
make it across this thing?

02:56:35.533 --> 02:56:42.045
MATT: Make an intelligence check. Roll and add
your intelligence modifier.

02:56:42.045 --> 02:56:43.516
TALIESIN: It's a ten.

02:56:43.516 --> 02:56:45.841
LIAM: Take that zero off it, and you've got it.

02:56:45.841 --> 02:56:51.222
MATT: Best you can tell, Grog looks like a big
guy.

02:56:51.222 --> 02:56:57.632
LIAM: This is fun. You swing back and forth. Grog,
I think you might like this!

02:56:57.632 --> 02:57:00.983
MARISHA: How far across is the bridge? A hundred
feet?

02:57:00.983 --> 02:57:05.076
TALIESIN: Once you're across, let's secure the
rope that's attached to you, and we'll make

02:57:05.076 --> 02:57:07.748
ourselves a guideline that we can hang onto.

02:57:07.748 --> 02:57:08.919
LAURA: I like it.

02:57:08.919 --> 02:57:12.660
LIAM: All right, he sounds like a Debbie Downer,
Grog, but I'll go across, and you can follow.

02:57:12.660 --> 02:57:15.734
MATT: Okay, you make the rest of your way across.
No issue. The rope bridge carries your weight all

02:57:15.734 --> 02:57:17.028
the way.

02:57:17.028 --> 02:57:20.283
LAURA: Tie a rope. I tie the other side.

02:57:20.283 --> 02:57:22.724
LIAM: Is there anything on the other side I could
tie it to?

02:57:22.724 --> 02:57:30.757
MATT: There's a couple of small cliffside trees
that grow off in strange twisting bonsai tree-like

02:57:30.757 --> 02:57:32.594
branches that stick off. They're pretty sturdy.

02:57:32.594 --> 02:57:34.185
LIAM: I use a sailor knot.

02:57:34.185 --> 02:57:40.350
LAURA: I use a special ranger knot that's really
extra strong.

02:57:40.350 --> 02:57:42.921
MATT: Secret ranger knot. Well played.

02:57:42.921 --> 02:57:45.756
(laughter)

02:57:45.756 --> 02:57:47.670
MATT: Who's up next?

02:57:47.670 --> 02:57:49.798
LIAM: I double-knot mine.

02:57:49.798 --> 02:57:51.412
SAM: We've got to get the horses across.

02:57:51.412 --> 02:57:52.719
TRAVIS: No, they ain't coming.

02:57:52.719 --> 02:57:55.557
SAM: They're not coming? Oh. Well, I just
Dimension Door across, then.

02:57:55.557 --> 02:58:00.650
LIAM: Jeepers! Will you warn a half-elf when
you're going to do that?

02:58:00.650 --> 02:58:07.892
MATT: Spooks you for a second. You hold on
and you make your way across. You guys

02:58:07.892 --> 02:58:10.621
are now on the other side. You're holding onto
everyone's horses left behind.

02:58:10.668 --> 02:58:11.948
LAURA: Trinket.

02:58:11.948 --> 02:58:15.926
TRAVIS: I tie up all the horses to a very large
tree.

02:58:15.926 --> 02:58:17.953
MARISHA: Are we going by foot now?

02:58:17.953 --> 02:58:29.643
LAURA: Looks like it. Tiberius, are you still on
our side? Are you with me, still? Will you cast

02:58:29.643 --> 02:58:32.155
Fly on Trinket? I love you.

02:58:32.155 --> 02:58:37.635
ORION: Sure. To make it across?

02:58:37.635 --> 02:58:42.254
LAURA: I can climb on him and you cast Fly and you
only have to use one little spell.

02:58:42.254 --> 02:58:47.004
ORION: If I cast it on him, I would probably jump on
myself, because I'm a little bit heavier than you

02:58:47.004 --> 02:58:48.392
are, darling.

02:58:48.392 --> 02:58:49.442
LAURA: Then do it!

02:58:49.442 --> 02:58:50.963
LIAM: She's haggling you right now.

02:58:50.963 --> 02:58:52.618
ORION: You can have him afterwards.

02:58:52.618 --> 02:58:56.091
LAURA: Yeah, you can go, and I'll just use the
little rope.

02:58:56.091 --> 02:58:59.511
ORION: Fine. Proceed.

02:58:59.511 --> 02:59:01.428
MATT: You cast Fly on Trinket--

02:59:01.428 --> 02:59:05.055
ORION: No, I don't. I don't do shit yet. I wait
for you guys to get across, so if something

02:59:05.055 --> 02:59:06.984
happens, then I can cast it.

02:59:06.984 --> 02:59:08.752
LAURA: Okay, just protect him.

02:59:08.752 --> 02:59:10.653
MATT: So you get on Trinket's back?

02:59:10.653 --> 02:59:12.510
LAURA: No, he hasn't cast it on him yet.

02:59:12.510 --> 02:59:15.096
MATT: So who's going across now?

02:59:15.096 --> 02:59:16.146
LAURA: I am!

02:59:16.146 --> 02:59:22.380
MATT: Okay, you make it across. No problem. You're
light enough and able to guide the movement of the

02:59:22.380 --> 02:59:23.281
bridge.

02:59:23.281 --> 02:59:25.675
LAURA: Good thing I only had one frittata the
other day!

02:59:25.675 --> 02:59:31.069
MARISHA: Here's my question. What looks shaky, the
connection of the bridge or the actual, physical

02:59:31.069 --> 02:59:32.639
condition of the bridge itself?

02:59:32.639 --> 02:59:35.959
MATT: The physical condition of the bridge. There
is no actual visible point that is--

02:59:35.959 --> 02:59:45.602
MARISHA: For bonus added safety in case this
bridge gives way, I'm going to cast Grasping Vine

02:59:45.602 --> 02:59:52.743
and have it loop and wrap around the edge of the
bridge. Further enforce it.

02:59:52.743 --> 02:59:59.324
MATT: The vines reach around and wrap around the
edges of the wood slats and the rope handholds,

02:59:59.324 --> 03:00:01.379
and it seems to be pretty well-held on that side.

03:00:01.379 --> 03:00:02.703
TALIESIN: Clever!

03:00:02.703 --> 03:00:08.669
MARISHA: At least that side will be fine. And then
I'll go across.

03:00:08.669 --> 03:00:12.239
MATT: Cool, you make it across without a problem.

03:00:12.239 --> 03:00:14.339
TRAVIS: Who else needs to go across?

03:00:14.339 --> 03:00:18.791
LAURA: Just you and Tiberius and Trinket.

03:00:18.791 --> 03:00:20.377
TRAVIS: You want me to go first?

03:00:20.377 --> 03:00:28.142
ORION: It's fine! I hop on Trinket and I pet
Lockheed. And then I hop on Trinket and I cast Fly

03:00:28.183 --> 03:00:34.243
on him and say, Remember how to go across. 
And then as we start flying

03:00:34.243 --> 03:00:40.056
across, I cast Telekinesis on Grog and take him
with me. Kind of like Green Lantern.

03:00:40.056 --> 03:00:43.433
MARISHA: Concentration spells.

03:00:43.433 --> 03:00:48.061
ORION: Yeah. That should be 12 seconds to get across
a bridge, right?

03:00:48.061 --> 03:00:52.596
MATT: Yeah, that would be 12 seconds, which will
be enough time. So as you're coasting over with

03:00:52.596 --> 03:00:57.314
Trinket, floating (bear sounds) you turn around
and cast Telekinesis. Grog, all of a sudden,

03:00:57.314 --> 03:01:01.268
you're lifted up and held aloft. You look down
over yourself, waving your hands instinctually.

03:01:01.268 --> 03:01:06.560
Looking down, you can see a 600, 700 foot drop
before the rock comes to a point which would probably

03:01:06.560 --> 03:01:12.641
splinter or crush anyone who fell into it, and
then is pushed out to the ocean. So it's a little

03:01:12.641 --> 03:01:16.224
scary, but you start flailing about as you're
being pulled across by Tiberius. Eventually,

03:01:16.224 --> 03:01:23.297
Trinket comes, lands on the other side safely. You
guide Grog over, down onto his feet. Safe and

03:01:23.297 --> 03:01:24.327
sound.

03:01:24.327 --> 03:01:25.526
MARISHA: Who's left?

03:01:25.526 --> 03:01:27.083
SAM: No one. The horses.

03:01:27.083 --> 03:01:30.216
LAURA: Oh yeah, what do you want to do with the
horses?

03:01:30.216 --> 03:01:31.553
TRAVIS: We tied them up.

03:01:31.553 --> 03:01:36.325
ORION: I'm going to dispel the Fly. But I'm going
to hold the Telekinesis for the ten minutes I can

03:01:36.325 --> 03:01:40.254
on Grog. I'm not going to do anything, I'm just
going to keep that spell going.

03:01:40.254 --> 03:01:43.839
MATT: Okay. Cool. All righty.

03:01:43.839 --> 03:01:47.330
SAM: I say a prayer of thanks to the horses, who
will surely die of starvation.

03:01:47.330 --> 03:01:56.192
LAURA: They were tied up in a super grassy area
with a shit-ton of water around.

03:01:56.192 --> 03:02:00.273
LIAM: They'll be eaten by something long before
that. It's fine.

03:02:00.273 --> 03:02:03.932
MARISHA: So what's our plan? What are we doing?

03:02:03.932 --> 03:02:06.364
SAM: The plan is walk until we get there.

03:02:06.364 --> 03:02:12.283
MATT: The path pinches a little bit tighter as you
go across, about a ten foot width and you guys

03:02:12.283 --> 03:02:19.489
begin pulling across. There's a sudden large gust
of sea air blows in as you guys go ahead and

03:02:19.489 --> 03:02:23.427
buckle down to hold on. I'd like you all to roll
an athletics check.

03:02:23.427 --> 03:02:26.526
LAURA: Are we in mountains yet? So I have
advantage?

03:02:26.526 --> 03:02:28.096
MATT: You have advantage on it.

03:02:28.096 --> 03:02:29.738
TRAVIS: Me too, because mountains are my
favorite--

03:02:29.738 --> 03:02:31.029
MATT: That's true, yeah!

03:02:31.029 --> 03:02:34.282
LAURA: What is this, acrobatics?

03:02:34.282 --> 03:02:36.259
SAM and LAURA: Athletics.

03:02:36.259 --> 03:02:37.487
SAM: Nine.

03:02:37.487 --> 03:02:39.232
ORION. 18.

03:02:39.232 --> 03:02:40.341
MARISHA: 19.

03:02:40.341 --> 03:02:41.431
TALIESIN: Ten.

03:02:41.431 --> 03:02:43.454
LAURA: 11.

03:02:43.454 --> 03:02:44.394
TRAVIS: 23.

03:02:44.394 --> 03:02:51.388
MATT: All right, as you guys are holding tight,
both Scanlan and Vax are trying to grab something,

03:02:51.388 --> 03:02:54.976
holding onto rocks, but before they can get
enough, they're both so small, it pushes them

03:02:54.976 --> 03:02:55.903
out.

03:02:55.903 --> 03:02:57.810
ORION: How much time has passed?

03:02:57.810 --> 03:03:03.005
MATT: It's three seconds. Oh! Passed since the
bridge? About five, six minutes.

03:03:03.005 --> 03:03:06.702
ORION: Can I try to catch them because I still
have the Telekinesis going?

03:03:06.702 --> 03:03:08.715
MATT: You can catch one of them.

03:03:08.715 --> 03:03:10.992
ORION: (yelling) Why, Matthew?!

03:03:10.992 --> 03:03:13.183
MATT: Because the spell has to be directed!

03:03:13.183 --> 03:03:14.748
MARISHA: Are they flying off a cliff?

03:03:14.748 --> 03:03:18.571
MATT: They're both being dragged by the wind off
the side of the cliff. You can see them grabbing

03:03:18.571 --> 03:03:22.800
the ground. Vax is being pulled off the side as
Scanlan is actually lifted off his feet.

03:03:22.800 --> 03:03:24.577
ORION: I know Vax can't. I grab Vax!

03:03:24.577 --> 03:03:26.272
LIAM: Tell my sister I love her!

03:03:26.272 --> 03:03:28.286
TRAVIS: I jump and try and grab Vex.

03:03:28.286 --> 03:03:31.745
LAURA: Vax. You want to hold me?

03:03:31.745 --> 03:03:33.022
LIAM: I'm Vox.

03:03:33.022 --> 03:03:34.536
ORION: Wait, you're grabbing him?

03:03:34.536 --> 03:03:36.415
LAURA: I'm Vex.

03:03:36.415 --> 03:03:37.840
TRAVIS: That's what I said!

03:03:37.840 --> 03:03:44.064
MATT: You grab Vax and hold him in place as you
reach out and grab Vax by the arms and pull him

03:03:44.064 --> 03:03:45.270
back onto--

03:03:45.270 --> 03:03:46.352
LIAM: Wait, who?

03:03:46.352 --> 03:03:47.244
ORION: You!

03:03:47.244 --> 03:03:48.475
LIAM: Oh, &lt;i&gt;he&lt;/i&gt; grabs me!

03:03:48.475 --> 03:03:49.439
TRAVIS: I grab her.

03:03:49.439 --> 03:03:50.713
LAURA: Grog grabbed me.

03:03:50.713 --> 03:03:53.721
MATT: You were fine.

03:03:53.721 --> 03:03:55.669
LAURA: I know. But he still said he'd grabbed me.

03:03:55.669 --> 03:04:01.746
MATT: Okay. Then you're being held aloft by
Tiberius' Telekinesis concentrating. Scanlan has

03:04:01.746 --> 03:04:03.061
fallen out of view.

03:04:03.061 --> 03:04:04.858
MARISHA: I Grasping Vine him before he goes out of
view.

03:04:04.858 --> 03:04:08.308
MATT: Okay. It's all right.

03:04:08.308 --> 03:04:11.004
MARISHA: Off the side of the cliff.

03:04:11.004 --> 03:04:14.010
MATT: Go ahead and make an attack roll with your
Grasping Vine.

03:04:14.010 --> 03:04:16.318
ORION: I can manipulate a thousand pounds.

03:04:16.318 --> 03:04:17.299
LIAM: You've got me.

03:04:17.299 --> 03:04:18.489
MARISHA: What?!

03:04:18.489 --> 03:04:20.824
MATT: This is to aim the vine as he falls.

03:04:20.824 --> 03:04:21.953
MARISHA: 19.

03:04:21.953 --> 03:04:27.808
MATT: 19? Not a problem! The vine grabs Scanlan
and pulls him back and holds him as the wind

03:04:27.808 --> 03:04:29.335
slowly dies down.

03:04:29.335 --> 03:04:32.786
ORION: I guide Vax back to the cliff.

03:04:32.786 --> 03:04:39.321
MATT: The wind dies down. You guys now begin
pushing yourselves close to the edge of this

03:04:39.321 --> 03:04:44.459
pathway up the side of this seaside cliff. It
doesn't seem to deviate much beyond that 15-foot

03:04:44.459 --> 03:04:48.672
width now, which puts you all at general unease.
As the sun's getting closer and closer to setting,

03:04:48.672 --> 03:04:51.968
you're making your way around the crest. You've
been traveling this mountain range for a good

03:04:51.968 --> 03:04:57.014
number of hours now. You're at a decent height,
you're on foot, a good distance inside the

03:04:57.014 --> 03:05:01.974
Alabaster Sierra mountain range. Perception check,
everyone.

03:05:01.974 --> 03:05:05.675
TALIESIN: Yeah!

03:05:05.675 --> 03:05:07.023
TRAVIS: Five.

03:05:07.023 --> 03:05:08.102
SAM: Four.

03:05:08.102 --> 03:05:09.359
MATT: Three, two, one.

03:05:09.359 --> 03:05:10.667
MARISHA: 25.

03:05:10.667 --> 03:05:11.678
TALIESIN: 26.

03:05:11.678 --> 03:05:12.969
LIAM: 29.

03:05:12.969 --> 03:05:14.133
LAURA: 25.

03:05:14.133 --> 03:05:16.546
ORION: I rolled a natural one, with negative two.

03:05:16.546 --> 03:05:24.493
MATT: Okay! Those of you with a higher perception
than 20 on this roll. As you pull along, you hear

03:05:24.493 --> 03:05:33.714
this echoing sound, this (bird-like sounds) in the
distance, the wind's carrying it as it's blowing

03:05:33.714 --> 03:05:34.866
past you.

03:05:34.866 --> 03:05:38.697
MARISHA: Does it sounds like anything
nature-based? Something I could possibly have

03:05:38.697 --> 03:05:40.036
talked to in the past?

03:05:40.036 --> 03:05:41.560
TALIESIN: Is it something I would know?

03:05:41.560 --> 03:05:48.150
MATT: Go ahead and make an intelligence check. You
go ahead and make a nature check.

03:05:48.150 --> 03:05:51.467
TALIESIN: 21.

03:05:51.467 --> 03:05:52.734
MARISHA: 25.

03:05:52.734 --> 03:06:00.515
MATT: It is birdish in nature, but it sounds too
guttural and too articulate to be a bird. There is

03:06:00.515 --> 03:06:06.236
enough of-- you notice there's a language of the
chittering that is bird-like, but there is actual

03:06:06.236 --> 03:06:13.996
voice. You recall that there are various creatures
that make the cliffsides home. One of the ones

03:06:13.996 --> 03:06:17.866
that are more obnoxious that some of the earlier
traders of Whitestone had problems with making

03:06:17.866 --> 03:06:21.540
this path for mining were clusters of harpies.

03:06:21.540 --> 03:06:23.917
MARISHA: Oh, fucking harpies.

03:06:23.917 --> 03:06:25.323
TALIESIN and ORION: Harpies.

03:06:25.323 --> 03:06:29.284
ORION: They're the opposite of the Harpers, which
are good.

03:06:29.284 --> 03:06:31.789
TRAVIS: What's a harpy?

03:06:31.789 --> 03:06:35.498
ORION: A harpy's a jerk, a stupid butthole who's
super loud.

03:06:35.498 --> 03:06:39.925
MATT: You glance over as you guys are having this
conversation. Behind you, you can see in the

03:06:39.925 --> 03:06:44.814
distance from where you were, a couple of these
dark shapes swooping down. You see a cluster of

03:06:44.814 --> 03:06:46.591
about four or five of these harpies diving.

03:06:46.591 --> 03:06:48.962
TALIESIN: Can we find a place to maybe settle
down?

03:06:48.962 --> 03:06:53.409
LAURA: Can we stealth? I cast Pass Without a Trace
on us!

03:06:53.409 --> 03:06:55.439
SAM: Don't worry! I can make us all look like cows
again!

03:06:55.439 --> 03:06:57.816
MARISHA: (shushes) Everyone be quiet!

03:06:57.816 --> 03:07:01.059
MATT How long is the concentration on Pass Without
a Trace? How long can you hold that

03:07:01.059 --> 03:07:02.526
concentration?

03:07:02.526 --> 03:07:05.792
LAURA: Up to one hour.

03:07:05.792 --> 03:07:08.741
MATT: Okay. It has faded since then.

03:07:08.741 --> 03:07:13.072
MARISHA: Where are we against the mountain? Are we
still on the mountain edge?

03:07:13.072 --> 03:07:15.900
MATT: Yeah, you're still on the path, and you look
back from where you came from.

03:07:15.900 --> 03:07:18.564
MARISHA: So we have a mountain behind our backs?

03:07:18.564 --> 03:07:20.277
MATT: Yeah, a sheer cliff.

03:07:20.277 --> 03:07:27.141
MARISHA: I turn around and I cast Move Earth, my
6th-level fucker. And I (boof) and I clear out a

03:07:27.141 --> 03:07:28.632
cave.

03:07:28.632 --> 03:07:33.753
MATT: Okay. As you're concentrating on this,
eventually, Keyleth begins to focus, and over the

03:07:33.753 --> 03:07:36.839
next minute or so, she begins to push a cavern.

03:07:36.839 --> 03:07:38.601
LAURA: I cast Pass Without a Trace on us now.

03:07:38.601 --> 03:07:43.180
MATT: Okay. As this is happening, you can see the
harpies have definitely found some sort of prey.

03:07:43.180 --> 03:07:47.298
They're distracted as they're slowly tearing apart
what you gather are the horses you left behind.

03:07:47.298 --> 03:07:50.236
LAURA: Oh no! Terrible!

03:07:50.236 --> 03:07:57.186
MATT: Yeah. Good news is, they're distracted.

03:07:57.246 --> 03:07:59.666
MARISHA: Horses saved our lives, guys.

03:07:59.666 --> 03:08:03.190
MATT: Bad news is they're probably not going
to be there when you come back.

03:08:03.190 --> 03:08:05.529
TALIESIN: It's getting dark. I think we should
camp.

03:08:05.529 --> 03:08:07.582
LIAM: So you're saying there's a chance.

03:08:07.582 --> 03:08:14.525
MATT: Over the next few minutes or so, Keyleth,
you've pushed a good ten by 15-foot cavern into

03:08:14.525 --> 03:08:19.777
the side of this wall that didn't previously
exist. You guys are able to step out of the light

03:08:19.777 --> 03:08:25.024
as the sun's starting to disappear over the
mountain range, the Cliffkeep, which you can see

03:08:25.024 --> 03:08:28.166
in the distance across this channel now. There's a
channel of water between the two.

03:08:28.166 --> 03:08:33.454
MARISHA: I go ahead and Druidcraft a little
campfire. Tiberius, you want to light a fire for

03:08:33.454 --> 03:08:34.488
us?

03:08:34.488 --> 03:08:39.110
LAURA: I'm going to use Hide in Plain Sight. I'm
going to see if I can do this. That sort of

03:08:39.110 --> 03:08:43.881
ability to camouflage the opening of the cave to
where they wouldn't be able to see it.

03:08:43.881 --> 03:08:48.470
MATT: Sure! Go ahead and make a stealth check.

03:08:48.470 --> 03:08:54.335
LAURA: 28.

03:08:54.335 --> 03:09:00.797
MATT: Okay! You take the next 15 minutes or so,
finding what nearby pieces of brush you can and rocks

03:09:00.797 --> 03:09:05.595
that have been loosely around the area and you
start setting up this pattern of them that closes

03:09:05.595 --> 03:09:11.782
off some of the entrance from the smooth
opening that Keyleth had created. It takes a

03:09:11.782 --> 03:09:15.530
little ingenuity because it's just a rock opening,
and there isn't a whole lot of brush and things

03:09:15.614 --> 03:09:19.476
around. But you feel you've managed to mask it to
the point that to a distant eye it would be hard

03:09:19.476 --> 03:09:24.753
to see that there is an actual cavern there. At
this point, the sun has set, night has come in,

03:09:24.753 --> 03:09:28.636
and you guys are sitting within this cavern
hearing the distant sound of the ocean waves

03:09:28.636 --> 03:09:32.990
crashing against the bottom of these cliffside,
coastal fjords.

03:09:32.990 --> 03:09:34.760
MARISHA: Me and Tiberius made a fire.

03:09:34.760 --> 03:09:36.207
MATT: All right, a fire is made.

03:09:36.207 --> 03:09:38.027
ORION: I lit it with my spitting.

03:09:38.027 --> 03:09:45.650
MATT: Okay. Tiberius forms a relatively useful and
effective campfire within this cave.

03:09:45.650 --> 03:09:54.997
LAURA: Oh! I want to use my holy oil and dip a
couple arrows in the holy oil because I know I can

03:09:54.997 --> 03:09:57.195
make three based on what we've done before.

03:09:57.195 --> 03:10:00.325
MATT: You can, yes. Do be aware, the holy oil will
only last about a day.

03:10:00.325 --> 03:10:04.038
LAURA: Oh, really? Oh, so I'll do that right
before.

03:10:04.038 --> 03:10:08.179
MATT: It's one of those things where if you dip it
now and leave it, over time it'll just either

03:10:08.179 --> 03:10:11.537
evaporate or drip off of the arrow.

03:10:11.537 --> 03:10:13.125
LAURA: Good to know.

03:10:13.125 --> 03:10:18.129
LIAM: While my sister's looking at her shit, I
bogart Trinket and climb up onto him, use him like a

03:10:18.129 --> 03:10:23.334
sleeping bag and cuddle into his softest warm
parts and fall asleep.

03:10:23.334 --> 03:10:27.024
MATT: (bear groaning) Trinket, at first, just
haplessly pushes you away, but recognizes your

03:10:27.024 --> 03:10:28.372
scent and lets you.

03:10:28.372 --> 03:10:29.917
LAURA: You ganked my sleeping bag.

03:10:29.917 --> 03:10:31.679
LIAM: Sorry, not sorry.

03:10:31.679 --> 03:10:39.506
ORION: I find a little patch of dust and do a
little dust bath real quick and then I'm going to

03:10:39.506 --> 03:10:46.355
use one of my books of stuffs and start
researching liches just because I want to.

03:10:46.355 --> 03:10:54.161
MATT: Okay. I mean, what book would you be
researching this in?

03:10:54.161 --> 03:10:57.905
ORION: Tobin's Spirit Guide?

03:10:57.905 --> 03:11:02.447
MATT: The researcher ability is that you can go to
places of research and find books. You don't

03:11:02.447 --> 03:11:06.881
really keep a tome of all knowledge with you. The
next time you find a town or you're in town, then you

03:11:06.969 --> 03:11:09.042
can use that ability to research in advance.

03:11:09.042 --> 03:11:12.005
LAURA: I ask Grog how he's doing.

03:11:12.005 --> 03:11:14.351
TRAVIS: I'm bored as shit.

03:11:14.351 --> 03:11:16.401
LAURA: You want to arm wrestle?

03:11:16.401 --> 03:11:17.483
TRAVIS: No.

03:11:17.483 --> 03:11:19.285
LAURA: All right.

03:11:19.285 --> 03:11:24.301
SAM: Come on, do it, Grog! Come on, you can't beat
a girl?

03:11:24.301 --> 03:11:27.507
MATT: Do you guys all rest for the evening?

03:11:27.507 --> 03:11:29.275
LAURA and LIAM: Yeah.

03:11:29.275 --> 03:11:31.020
LAURA: But we should take watch.

03:11:31.020 --> 03:11:36.267
TALIESIN: I'm still awake. I'm going to fall
asleep last.

03:11:36.267 --> 03:11:39.167
MARISHA: I also stay up with Percy.

03:11:39.167 --> 03:11:40.398
MATT: Okay.

03:11:40.398 --> 03:11:42.511
SAM: I'll take first watch.

03:11:42.511 --> 03:11:45.084
LAURA: Wake me up when you're tired.

03:11:45.084 --> 03:11:46.712
ORION: I'm gonna feed Lockheed some treats.

03:11:46.712 --> 03:11:51.065
MATT: Okay. You guys continue your business for
the evening.

03:11:51.065 --> 03:11:57.552
MARISHA: I talk to Percy for a second. Percy,
while we're alone for a moment, there's something

03:11:57.552 --> 03:12:04.409
that's been bothering me, and I can't get it out
of my head. I thought I'd talk to you about it

03:12:04.409 --> 03:12:10.192
because I feel-- we're friends, right? We're
friends? Are we friends?

03:12:10.192 --> 03:12:13.061
TALIESIN: Sure! I'd like to think so, yes.

03:12:13.061 --> 03:12:15.902
MARISHA: Been through a lot, been together a
while.

03:12:15.902 --> 03:12:17.622
TALIESIN: It's been a while, yes.

03:12:17.622 --> 03:12:18.907
MARISHA: Two years now?

03:12:18.907 --> 03:12:20.502
TALIESIN: I suppose.

03:12:20.502 --> 03:12:23.604
SAM: I go invisible to see if I can hear their
conversation.

03:12:23.604 --> 03:12:26.826
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and make a perception check.

03:12:26.826 --> 03:12:30.075
SAM: Perception or stealth? 20.

03:12:30.075 --> 03:12:38.423
MATT: Okay. You are keeping relatively low and are
able to overhear their conversation.

03:12:38.423 --> 03:12:43.187
MARISHA: You know, you're a very brilliant
person.

03:12:43.187 --> 03:12:45.124
TALIESIN: Thank you.

03:12:45.124 --> 03:12:54.698
MARISHA: I can't help but feel like I'm being
watched right now. Never mind, forget I said

03:12:54.698 --> 03:13:06.582
anything. I can't help but feel like there's
something else, there's something more to this

03:13:06.582 --> 03:13:13.745
that you're not telling us. And I didn't really
think of anything until we were having that fight

03:13:13.745 --> 03:13:16.382
where Tiberius brutally murdered that old woman.

03:13:16.382 --> 03:13:19.961
TALIESIN: Been trying not to think about it.

03:13:19.961 --> 03:13:26.831
MARISHA: Yeah, me too. But the one thing that I
can't get out of my head was something that you

03:13:26.831 --> 03:13:37.699
said during that fight. And for a long time I was
like, damn, Percy's got really cool one-liners and

03:13:37.699 --> 03:13:42.562
he's so smart, and I wish I could have cool
one-liners. You and Grog have really cool

03:13:42.562 --> 03:13:54.109
one-liners. And then you said "your soul is now
forfeit" to the person you shot that night. And I

03:13:54.109 --> 03:13:58.566
thought, wow! That was an interesting one-liner.

03:13:58.566 --> 03:14:01.133
TALIESIN: I did say that, didn't I?

03:14:01.133 --> 03:14:06.655
MARISHA: Yeah! Yeah, you did. For some reason, I
was the only one who noticed it, and I don't know

03:14:06.655 --> 03:14:16.243
if that's because I'm just reading into things, if
that was just a really awesome, but scary and

03:14:16.243 --> 03:14:26.784
brutal thing to say in the moment, or if there's
something deeper that you might be serving.

03:14:26.784 --> 03:14:34.654
TALIESIN: Honestly, I'll say, I've had a number of
years thinking about what I would do and what I

03:14:34.654 --> 03:14:44.185
would say and how I would go about this. This kind
of obsession is not healthy, and I know that, and

03:14:44.185 --> 03:14:52.165
it's no way to live. And I'm sure that was
something on the list of things I thought I would

03:14:52.165 --> 03:15:03.255
say, some attempt to be scary when I met them, as
opposed to being scared, I think I was-- (sighs)

03:15:03.255 --> 03:15:10.916
again, I don't really remember much because I was
so angry. I've never been so angry. And I think I

03:15:10.916 --> 03:15:19.246
was just trying to sound threatening. And I'd had
these dreams before, you know I've-- you don't build

03:15:19.246 --> 03:15:26.761
anything like this without the knowledge that
you're-- I'm aware that inventing this thing has

03:15:26.761 --> 03:15:28.684
been a mistake.

03:15:28.684 --> 03:15:30.231
MARISHA: What thing?

03:15:30.231 --> 03:15:32.451
TALIESIN: I pull out my gun.

03:15:32.451 --> 03:15:39.516
MARISHA: Wait, what are you saying? You had
knowledge? You didn't build that without

03:15:39.516 --> 03:15:41.376
inspiration? What do you mean?

03:15:41.376 --> 03:15:48.522
TALIESIN: I've had thoughts about it, but I didn't
really think about what I was doing or what I was

03:15:48.522 --> 03:15:55.418
going to build until I decided to take my revenge,
and I'd never thought about building it because I

03:15:55.418 --> 03:16:04.018
realized what a dangerous idea it was. (sighs) And
I fear for the day that that comes back to haunt

03:16:04.018 --> 03:16:12.745
me. I don't know what I'll do, but I don't know, I
think I was just trying to say something to be

03:16:12.745 --> 03:16:17.224
intimidating. I honestly didn't even think I was
going to kill him, it just happened.

03:16:17.224 --> 03:16:19.960
MARISHA: Can I see if he's lying to me?

03:16:19.960 --> 03:16:22.613
MATT: Go ahead and make an insight check.

03:16:22.613 --> 03:16:29.131
MARISHA: 17.

03:16:29.131 --> 03:16:31.471
MATT: 17. Roll a d20.

03:16:31.471 --> 03:16:33.163
TALIESIN: Is your insight really that good?

03:16:33.163 --> 03:16:34.866
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm wise as fuck!

03:16:34.866 --> 03:16:37.577
MATT: And add your charisma modifier.

03:16:37.577 --> 03:16:42.020
TALIESIN: Add my charisma modifier? 18.

03:16:42.020 --> 03:16:51.622
MATT: Best you can tell, he's seeming honest, and
sharing open-hearted to you. You feel like you've

03:16:51.622 --> 03:16:54.877
really gotten to the core truth of what Percy's
about.

03:16:54.877 --> 03:16:56.622
MARISHA: What? What did you say?

03:16:56.622 --> 03:16:58.938
MATT: You feel like you've gotten to the core and
truth of what Percy's about, and perhaps your

03:16:58.938 --> 03:17:04.742
questioning this has upset him, and you feel like
maybe you've pushed this a little too far.

03:17:04.742 --> 03:17:16.189
TALIESIN: I do regret what happened and I know he
was a bad man, but I still hope to never lose my

03:17:16.189 --> 03:17:18.040
temper like that again.

03:17:18.040 --> 03:17:20.641
LIAM: Got to roleplay that shit. He convinced
you.

03:17:20.641 --> 03:17:27.620
MARISHA: I still really feel like we're being
watched. Do you feel that? I don't know.

03:17:27.620 --> 03:17:30.321
TALIESIN: Honestly, I think we both need sleep.

03:17:30.321 --> 03:17:33.456
MARISHA: It's really distracting. Yeah. Well, I
love you.

03:17:33.456 --> 03:17:34.925
TALIESIN: I love you, too.

03:17:34.925 --> 03:17:37.635
MARISHA: We're in this with you until this end.

03:17:37.635 --> 03:17:39.103
TALIESIN: Thank you.

03:17:39.103 --> 03:17:41.561
MARISHA: Let's sleep.

03:17:41.561 --> 03:17:48.229
MATT: Okay. You guys, through your turns, the
evening goes by uneventful. Morning comes to you.

03:17:48.229 --> 03:17:54.222
You can hear the distant caws of seagulls waking
you up as the heat from the morning sun begins to

03:17:54.222 --> 03:17:57.858
eventually hit this side of the cave. Since you're
on this side of the mountain, by the time you wake

03:17:57.858 --> 03:18:01.089
up, you realize the hour's probably a little bit
past noon.

03:18:01.089 --> 03:18:02.398
LAURA: Oh shit.

03:18:02.398 --> 03:18:04.310
MARISHA: We overslept!

03:18:04.310 --> 03:18:07.125
ORION: It's so dark in here, because of the cave
thing.

03:18:07.125 --> 03:18:11.189
MARISHA: Okay, so wait. Percy, how much further
out are we from Whitestone?

03:18:11.189 --> 03:18:18.377
MATT: You gather you probably have about a day's
worth of travel, and you'll be able to make your

03:18:18.377 --> 03:18:22.486
way down into the ravine from here. You've come up
quite a bit of the mountain range.

03:18:22.486 --> 03:18:26.434
TALIESIN: Probably another day before we can camp
close enough to attack.

03:18:26.434 --> 03:18:28.734
SAM: Let's get going.

03:18:28.734 --> 03:18:32.154
LAURA: Should we stealth through the mountains,
just in case they have any kind of lookouts?

03:18:32.154 --> 03:18:33.752
ORION: Oh, they will have lookouts.

03:18:33.752 --> 03:18:36.520
LAURA: I cast Pass Without a Trace on us again.

03:18:36.520 --> 03:18:37.912
LIAM: Let's go slower.

03:18:37.912 --> 03:18:40.397
LAURA: Should we all stealth? Try at least?

03:18:40.397 --> 03:18:41.540
LIAM: Yes.

03:18:41.540 --> 03:18:43.003
TALIESIN: Let's keep stealthy.

03:18:43.003 --> 03:18:48.112
MATT: Okay. You guys gather outside of the cavern
and head up, continuing along this path.

03:18:48.112 --> 03:18:59.251
Eventually, you do notice that the path becomes
broken and too steep to continue. It actually

03:18:59.251 --> 03:19:06.410
falls and tumbles down into this long, sliding
ravine. There is a slight rockslide trail that

03:19:06.410 --> 03:19:10.939
you could climb up and over and it looks like
there is a separate ravine, or a separation where

03:19:10.939 --> 03:19:15.338
the two mountains join, that could possibly be
traversed. But continuing on the seaside path is

03:19:15.338 --> 03:19:19.709
not going to work. It does bring you inward
towards-- maybe a little further south than you

03:19:19.709 --> 03:19:23.554
would have wanted to for optimal backdoor entrance
into Whitestone, but it's about your only path.

03:19:23.554 --> 03:19:26.286
TALIESIN: Have I walked this path before? I never
walked this path at all.

03:19:26.286 --> 03:19:31.633
MATT: You would have had no reason to walk this
path. You've heard about it, you know of this side

03:19:31.633 --> 03:19:34.927
of the mountain range, but based on your history,
there's no reason you would have come here.

03:19:34.927 --> 03:19:37.470
ORION: Whatever it takes to get to that back
door.

03:19:37.470 --> 03:19:40.478
MATT: Everyone make a stealth check, by the way.
Just so we're aware of what your stealth rolls are

03:19:40.478 --> 03:19:42.168
with the Pass Without a Trace.

03:19:42.168 --> 03:19:43.494
LAURA: Add ten to it.

03:19:43.494 --> 03:19:45.687
LIAM: You get ten? Oh. Well, I got a 40, then.

03:19:45.687 --> 03:19:46.494
MATT: Okay.

03:19:46.494 --> 03:19:47.218
SAM: 27

03:19:47.218 --> 03:19:48.198
MATT: 27.

03:19:48.198 --> 03:19:50.599
ORION: Nine.

03:19:50.599 --> 03:19:52.327
MATT: With the ten?

03:19:52.327 --> 03:19:53.739
ORION: Oh, 19.

03:19:53.739 --> 03:19:54.940
MARISHA: 32.

03:19:54.940 --> 03:19:55.991
TALIESIN: 32.

03:19:55.991 --> 03:19:56.880
TRAVIS: 27.

03:19:56.880 --> 03:19:57.859
LAURA: 37.

03:19:57.859 --> 03:20:02.448
MATT: That's a pretty good spread. So you guys,
you've hit the edge of the path. Are you heading

03:20:02.448 --> 03:20:04.012
up the rockslide trail?

03:20:04.012 --> 03:20:04.941
LAURA: Yes.

03:20:04.941 --> 03:20:08.104
MATT: Okay. You all, one by one, begin to climb
over the trail and some rocks tumble loose beneath

03:20:08.104 --> 03:20:10.608
your feet, grasp. And you help each other get to
the very top.

03:20:10.608 --> 03:20:12.277
ORION: I use my Mage Hand to help.

03:20:12.277 --> 03:20:15.034
MATT: (laughs) That's adorable.

03:20:15.034 --> 03:20:19.110
(laughter)

03:20:19.110 --> 03:20:22.348
LAURA: As he looks at the clock! "That's
adorable."

03:20:22.348 --> 03:20:28.326
MATT: So you all eventually manage to make it over
the top of the rockslide trail and eventually it

03:20:28.326 --> 03:20:33.860
leads you to where these two large mountains come
together, and there is a small path that leads

03:20:33.860 --> 03:20:38.124
between. It winds and travels downward. You can
see bits of the rock have fallen and crumbled, and

03:20:38.124 --> 03:20:41.719
there are small boulders and such that just, over
time and through erosion, have tumbled down this

03:20:41.719 --> 03:20:48.568
ravine to start filling it with occasional chunks
of stone. You begin walking through this ravine

03:20:48.568 --> 03:20:52.905
for another good 45 minutes to an hour, keeping a
keen eye out.

03:20:52.905 --> 03:21:02.457
ORION: Is this the same ravine that we're
travelling across?

03:21:02.457 --> 03:21:06.737
MATT: Basically, you guys have been traveling up
the side of the coast. You've now turned inward

03:21:06.737 --> 03:21:11.031
over the mountain range to head down into the
valley of Whitestone. You are currently just now

03:21:11.031 --> 03:21:13.758
heading up through the mountain range, inwards
towards the mountain.

03:21:13.758 --> 03:21:15.429
TALIESIN: Is this the river?

03:21:15.429 --> 03:21:20.516
MATT: There's no river here. It's just stone that
comes together for a pathway in between. This is

03:21:20.516 --> 03:21:23.239
where two large peaks of the mountains basically
come to join at the bottom.

03:21:23.239 --> 03:21:24.723
TALIESIN: Okay, so we're not at the river.

03:21:24.723 --> 03:21:30.086
MATT: No, the river is actually inside the valley
and to the south of Whitestone. So pressing down I

03:21:30.086 --> 03:21:31.957
would like you all to roll a perception check.

03:21:31.957 --> 03:21:33.317
LAURA: Jesus.

03:21:33.317 --> 03:21:35.264
MARISHA: Ah, that's all right.

03:21:35.264 --> 03:21:36.286
SAM: One!

03:21:36.286 --> 03:21:37.522
LAURA: Natural 20!

03:21:37.522 --> 03:21:38.849
LIAM: Natural 20!

03:21:38.849 --> 03:21:40.691
LIAM: Yeah!

03:21:40.691 --> 03:21:43.304
MATT: One, one, 20, 20.

03:21:43.304 --> 03:21:44.449
ORION: 16.

03:21:44.449 --> 03:21:45.419
MARISHA: 14.

03:21:45.419 --> 03:21:46.388
TALIESIN: 16.

03:21:46.388 --> 03:21:52.727
MATT: Okay. As all of you guys are charging
forward, both Vex and Vax, you hear this slight

03:21:52.727 --> 03:21:58.845
noise of a couple rocks (clattering) in the ravine
behind you. You both turn and look and for a split

03:21:58.845 --> 03:22:05.638
second you swear you see between some of the rocks
and paths of jagged stone that mark the walls of

03:22:05.638 --> 03:22:11.542
this ravine, you see a quick blur of blue that
vanishes behind a higher platform above you.

03:22:11.542 --> 03:22:14.815
LIAM: Smurfs!

03:22:14.815 --> 03:22:16.878
LAURA: A blur of blue?

03:22:16.878 --> 03:22:22.453
MATT: A large blur of blue just disappears behind
one of the outcroppings that's blocking your view

03:22:22.453 --> 03:22:23.711
of higher up the ravine.

03:22:23.711 --> 03:22:26.353
LAURA: (shushes) Down. Hide.

03:22:26.353 --> 03:22:28.276
ORION: I cast Stoneskin.

03:22:28.276 --> 03:22:29.774
MATT: Okay.

03:22:29.774 --> 03:22:30.887
LIAM: Stealth.

03:22:30.887 --> 03:22:35.664
ORION: I fasten my Cloak of Displacement.

03:22:35.664 --> 03:22:37.614
LAURA: And I prepare--

03:22:37.614 --> 03:22:41.738
MATT: You guys prepare for a second, and as you're
all paying attention, you guys also see another

03:22:41.738 --> 03:22:46.571
shift of blue (whoosh) go across the way. And this
time you see it's something large and blue that

03:22:46.571 --> 03:22:51.409
moves across the stone and goes into a small
cavern that looks about 25 feet up the way that's

03:22:51.409 --> 03:22:54.352
just past your visual range from this low in the
ravine.

03:22:54.352 --> 03:22:57.071
LAURA: Do we have any visual on what it could be?

03:22:57.071 --> 03:23:03.355
MATT: It moved very quickly, and for a split
second, you could see it appeared to be-- the way

03:23:03.355 --> 03:23:09.201
it moved was almost serpentine, like (whoosh) and
vanished inside. You swear you saw limbs, though.

03:23:09.201 --> 03:23:11.888
It wasn't a giant snake. There was something
attached to it.

03:23:11.888 --> 03:23:19.640
LAURA: (whispering) Wyvern? I look at Keyleth.
Keyleth. (louder) And I whisper, but for sake of

03:23:19.640 --> 03:23:27.954
microphones, do you know of a creature that's
blue, and fast, and is kind of snakey but has arms

03:23:27.954 --> 03:23:29.318
and legs?

03:23:29.318 --> 03:23:35.552
MARISHA: Let me think about it for a second. Do I
know a creature that's blue and snakey?

03:23:35.552 --> 03:23:38.517
LIAM: It sounds like basilisks, but they're too
slow.

03:23:38.517 --> 03:23:40.379
MATT: What did you roll?

03:23:40.379 --> 03:23:42.781
MARISHA: I don't know. Ooh, that's 24.

03:23:42.781 --> 03:23:50.975
MATT: 24. You've heard of various lizard-like
creatures that grow to large sizes. Usually those

03:23:50.975 --> 03:23:54.617
fall into the realm of dragons and such. The color
blue, though, is uncommon, unless it were a blue

03:23:54.617 --> 03:24:03.426
dragon. However, the motion of this creature does
not seem to necessarily be the territory of a blue

03:24:03.426 --> 03:24:11.830
dragon. It's hard to point exactly what this 
is, but you do know it's probably something in the

03:24:11.830 --> 03:24:14.318
serpentine-type magical realm.

03:24:14.318 --> 03:24:17.229
TALIESIN: I heard them, I heard them describe it.
Would I know it from the description? Just from my

03:24:17.229 --> 03:24:18.608
local knowledge?

03:24:18.608 --> 03:24:20.118
MATT: Go ahead and make a history check.

03:24:20.118 --> 03:24:22.616
MARISHA: The blue thing's weird. The blue thing is
what's throwing me.

03:24:22.616 --> 03:24:23.599
TALIESIN: Nine.

03:24:23.599 --> 03:24:28.711
MATT: Nine. Unfortunately, nothing of this type
has come across you. If it has, it's been too

03:24:28.711 --> 03:24:32.838
long, and you've forgotten it. There are a number
of dangerous things that exist in these

03:24:32.838 --> 03:24:33.767
mountains.

03:24:33.767 --> 03:24:42.341
LAURA: I've got a really good idea. Wait. No!
Grog, pick up something really heavy, and throw it

03:24:42.341 --> 03:24:43.869
as far as you can.

03:24:43.869 --> 03:24:45.599
TRAVIS: I go over and I grab Scanlan--

03:24:45.599 --> 03:24:47.073
SAM: No!

03:24:47.073 --> 03:24:49.990
LAURA: A boulder or something.

03:24:49.990 --> 03:24:55.620
TRAVIS: I put Scanlan down. Find a large rock
that's tumbled down, maybe.

03:24:55.620 --> 03:24:58.643
MATT: Yeah, they're easy to find. There's like
some that are this big, some that are larger.

03:24:58.643 --> 03:24:59.960
They're really heavy.

03:24:59.960 --> 03:25:02.603
TRAVIS: And I discus the thing and (whoosh).

03:25:02.603 --> 03:25:06.113
MATT: Make an athletics check.

03:25:06.113 --> 03:25:09.199
TRAVIS: Well, that was great. 24.

03:25:09.199 --> 03:25:20.233
MATT: (whoosh) You release the rock. (impact) It
skids to a halt. As it does, you can see suddenly

03:25:20.233 --> 03:25:26.769
over the course (whoosh) something very quickly
move, and it's a head. It's a snout. You see it's

03:25:26.769 --> 03:25:40.963
probably a good six, seven-foot wide. A giant,
lizard-like, toothy jaw. Blue scales against it

03:25:40.963 --> 03:25:45.165
with large kind of horned ridges across the back
of its head. And its claws (clacking) on the edge.

03:25:45.165 --> 03:25:49.373
Looks down. Looks down at the rest of you. Rears
back.

03:25:49.373 --> 03:25:50.893
LAURA: It saw us?

03:25:50.893 --> 03:25:53.632
LIAM: Didn't see me.

03:25:53.632 --> 03:25:55.243
ORION: Well, of course it saw us.

03:25:55.243 --> 03:25:57.172
LAURA: With 37 stealth, yo. It saw us?

03:25:57.172 --> 03:25:59.755
MARISHA: But it didn't seem to give a shit?

03:25:59.755 --> 03:26:02.516
MATT: It just withdrew over the edge.

03:26:02.516 --> 03:26:03.899
SAM: Should we run?

03:26:03.899 --> 03:26:05.828
LAURA: Maybe just move really fast away from him

03:26:05.828 --> 03:26:09.795
MARISHA: I can, I can cast Anti-Life Shell on us.
Then we can haul ass really fast.

03:26:09.795 --> 03:26:11.367
SAM: Will it move with us, your shell?

03:26:11.367 --> 03:26:14.252
MARISHA: Yeah, as long as you stay close to me. It
moves with me.

03:26:14.252 --> 03:26:16.888
LIAM: Yeah, fuck this thing. Let's get out of
here.

03:26:16.888 --> 03:26:18.723
MARISHA: Okay! I cast Anti-Life Shell. Stay
close!

03:26:18.723 --> 03:26:27.253
MATT: Okay. As you begin casting and finish the
spell. As the sphere appears-- at which point you

03:26:27.253 --> 03:26:35.188
now see a large blue blur (whoosh) dart off of the
cliffside into the air (impact noise) and skidding

03:26:35.188 --> 03:26:39.017
right in front of you guys, blocking off the side
of the ravine you guys were running towards. You

03:26:39.017 --> 03:26:45.371
can now see it: a huge, elongated, serpentine body
covered in blue scales and horns. You can see what

03:26:45.371 --> 03:26:53.705
looks to be six to eight arms and a series of legs
all across its long, snakelike torso. As it looks

03:26:53.705 --> 03:27:00.418
it snarls at you all (snarls). And you see sparks
of energy, electricity (sparking noises) in its

03:27:00.418 --> 03:27:05.368
jaw. (growls, roars)

03:27:05.368 --> 03:27:06.730
LIAM: Salamander?

03:27:06.730 --> 03:27:08.642
MATT: And that's where we're going it end
tonight!

03:27:08.642 --> 03:27:09.736
(yelling)

03:27:09.736 --> 03:27:10.862
LAURA: Oh, jeez Louise!

03:27:10.862 --> 03:27:11.842
SAM: You can't do that!

03:27:11.842 --> 03:27:14.117
MATT: I can, because it's 10:30.

03:27:14.117 --> 03:27:16.565
LIAM: No, it's not. It's like 8:45.

03:27:16.565 --> 03:27:19.016
MATT: We can keep going if you guys want to stay
long. It's Thursday night.

03:27:19.016 --> 03:27:25.356
ZAC: I'm coming to you with my laptop before you
continue.

03:27:25.356 --> 03:27:27.209
LIAM: Who's that guy?

03:27:27.209 --> 03:27:29.707
MATT: But to give you a little perspective, that
is what essentially you'd be facing.

03:27:29.707 --> 03:27:32.213
(loud reactions)

03:27:32.213 --> 03:27:35.259
LAURA: What the fuck? It's got so many arms.

03:27:35.259 --> 03:27:38.418
LIAM: That's a kobold.

03:27:38.418 --> 03:27:40.658
MATT: Yeah, totally. Kobold.

03:27:40.658 --> 03:34:46.741
