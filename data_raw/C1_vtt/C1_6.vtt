MATT: Hello everyone! Welcome to Critical Role tonight!

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:05.479
We have some interesting adventurous points
to go over.

00:00:05.479 --> 00:00:08.467
We're also coming off International Tabletop Day,

00:00:08.467 --> 00:00:09.952
which we had a great time.

00:00:09.952 --> 00:00:11.699
Met a lot of the wonderful fans, one of which

00:00:11.699 --> 00:00:13.701
had created their own t-shirt of our group

00:00:13.701 --> 00:00:15.367
and inspired us to do the same!

00:00:15.367 --> 00:00:17.692
So you'll see a bunch of us wearing our fantastic,

00:00:17.692 --> 00:00:20.499
full assortment of Critical Role party member t-shirts tonight.

00:00:20.499 --> 00:00:23.470
Just for fun.

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:26.160
In the meantime, let’s go ahead and get this started,

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.937
as we all have the chance to warm up with

00:00:27.937 --> 00:00:30.761
character backgrounds and maybe a little surprise.

00:00:30.761 --> 00:00:32.847
So be back here in a few minutes, guys!

00:00:35.137 --> 00:00:40.402
(drumming battle music)

00:01:05.952 --> 00:01:11.239
(drumming battle music continues)

00:01:42.533 --> 00:01:44.740
ASHLEY: Pike grew up in the outskirts of town,

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:46.174
near the Bramblewood.

00:01:46.174 --> 00:01:48.511
Her ancestors were a family of deep gnomes

00:01:48.511 --> 00:01:50.672
with quite an unfavorable reputation.

00:01:50.672 --> 00:01:54.126
Thievery, destruction, and trickery left them

00:01:54.126 --> 00:01:56.919
with the curse of the last name Trickfoot.

00:01:56.919 --> 00:02:00.065
Sarenrae, the goddess of healing and redemption,

00:02:00.065 --> 00:02:02.935
had other plans for Pike's great-great-grandfather,

00:02:02.935 --> 00:02:05.437
Wilhand, who left his family at a young age

00:02:05.437 --> 00:02:06.713
after a dream.

00:02:06.713 --> 00:02:09.136
A dream that changed the course

00:02:09.136 --> 00:02:10.927
of the Trickfoot family.

00:02:10.927 --> 00:02:12.822
Wilhand devoted his life to Sarenrae

00:02:12.822 --> 00:02:15.252
and pledged from then on that him and his family

00:02:15.252 --> 00:02:18.218
would live a life of service and devotion.

00:02:18.218 --> 00:02:22.435
As a child, Pike seemed to have an affinity to heal.

00:02:22.435 --> 00:02:26.422
Whether it was animals, people, or even flowers,

00:02:26.422 --> 00:02:29.305
she felt she had a purpose in making things whole

00:02:29.305 --> 00:02:30.831
that had once been broken.

00:02:30.831 --> 00:02:33.582
She studied and learned the ways to heal

00:02:33.582 --> 00:02:35.070
through divine magic.

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.884
She lived a peaceful life, quiet and simple,

00:02:37.884 --> 00:02:40.757
until one day, Wilhand was captured

00:02:40.757 --> 00:02:43.744
and almost killed by a group of goliath barbarians.

00:02:43.744 --> 00:02:45.951
One of the goliaths took a stand

00:02:45.951 --> 00:02:47.589
against the murder of the innocent gnome

00:02:47.589 --> 00:02:50.946
and he himself was beaten, bloodied, and left for dead,

00:02:50.946 --> 00:02:53.013
abandoned by his herd.

00:02:54.093 --> 00:02:55.819
Wilhand went to Pike for help.

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:58.133
She prayed and healed this barbarian

00:02:58.133 --> 00:03:01.443
as best she could, bringing him back to life.

00:03:01.443 --> 00:03:04.537
When he awoke, she discovered his name

00:03:04.537 --> 00:03:06.682
was Grog Strongjaw.

00:03:06.682 --> 00:03:09.854
After that, they were best of friends,

00:03:09.854 --> 00:03:11.483
a rather unlikely pair.

00:03:11.483 --> 00:03:14.590
Little did she know that in a few years' time

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:17.403
Grog would soon return the favor

00:03:17.403 --> 00:03:20.054
and bring her back from the clutches of death.

00:03:23.374 --> 00:03:24.627
After being killed in battle,

00:03:24.627 --> 00:03:26.183
Pike felt angry.

00:03:26.183 --> 00:03:27.806
She wanted to be stronger

00:03:27.806 --> 00:03:29.495
so that it would never happen again.

00:03:29.495 --> 00:03:31.893
She spent four months at sea

00:03:31.893 --> 00:03:33.811
training with the men and women

00:03:33.811 --> 00:03:35.542
aboard a ship called the Broken Howl.

00:03:35.542 --> 00:03:39.131
Gripping her holy symbol in one hand,

00:03:39.131 --> 00:03:40.910
and her morningstar in the other,

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:43.145
this time, Pike is ready.

00:03:45.595 --> 00:03:48.730
TRAVIS: Right, Listen up! If you have ale,

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:52.580
then you have a friend in Grog Strongjaw!

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:55.724
A goliath of towering height and size,

00:03:55.724 --> 00:03:59.768
this barbarian has an appetite for the two great

00:03:59.768 --> 00:04:05.438
loves in his life: combat, women, and ale! (chuckle)

00:04:05.438 --> 00:04:06.540
(record scratch)

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:07.753
Wait.

00:04:07.753 --> 00:04:09.563
Easily the brains of the group,

00:04:09.563 --> 00:04:12.682
Grog is often consulted for his vast knowledge

00:04:12.682 --> 00:04:16.730
of shapes, colors, and (chuckle) shiny things!

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:18.679
...also ale.

00:04:18.679 --> 00:04:22.651
In his early years, armed with his two-handed great axe,

00:04:22.651 --> 00:04:25.804
Grog often enjoyed proving his might amongst the ranks

00:04:25.804 --> 00:04:27.882
of his family's wandering herd.

00:04:27.882 --> 00:04:33.262
But after coming upon an unsuspecting elderly gnome in the woods,

00:04:33.262 --> 00:04:36.773
he objected to the killing such an innocent life.

00:04:36.773 --> 00:04:41.699
A creature of impulse, Grog felt only pity for this...

00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:45.283
well this terrified little thing.

00:04:45.283 --> 00:04:48.180
And his disobedience cost him dearly.

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:49.302
(weapon crack)

00:04:49.302 --> 00:04:51.806
Beaten bloody, and banished by the herd leader,

00:04:51.806 --> 00:04:53.248
his uncle Kevdak,

00:04:53.248 --> 00:04:56.739
Grog was abandoned and left to die.

00:04:56.739 --> 00:05:00.414
Exiled from his herd, it was then that

00:05:00.414 --> 00:05:03.540
the relative of the very gnome he fought to save,

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:05.626
saved him.

00:05:05.626 --> 00:05:09.081
It was the kindness of a gnome cleric named Pike,

00:05:09.081 --> 00:05:12.868
that healed Grog, bringing him back from death's edge.

00:05:12.868 --> 00:05:16.934
And they have remained close friends ever since.

00:05:16.934 --> 00:05:18.162
(brawling sounds)

00:05:18.162 --> 00:05:20.322
Most nights, Grog can be found challenging

00:05:20.322 --> 00:05:22.901
entire taverns to wrestling matches! Ha!

00:05:22.901 --> 00:05:26.380
...or accompanying Scanlan to the nearest house,

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:28.309
where you pay for...

00:05:28.309 --> 00:05:29.553
lady favors.

00:05:29.553 --> 00:05:31.471
Also ale!

00:05:33.141 --> 00:05:34.925
MARISHA: A first Impression of Keyleth would

00:05:34.925 --> 00:05:36.334
leave you with little information

00:05:36.334 --> 00:05:37.800
on the half-elven druid.

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:40.601
You might even think that her social awkwardness

00:05:40.601 --> 00:05:43.356
due to her sheltered upbringing is kinda sweet.

00:05:43.356 --> 00:05:44.316
(chuckle)

00:05:44.316 --> 00:05:47.508
Of course, it would be unwise underestimate her

00:05:47.508 --> 00:05:49.056
based on first impressions.

00:05:49.056 --> 00:05:50.314
(thunder crack)

00:05:50.314 --> 00:05:52.826
Under that unintimidating petite frame is a

00:05:52.826 --> 00:05:55.328
vicious beast waiting to be unleashed,

00:05:55.328 --> 00:05:57.707
whose natural powers have made even the fiercest of

00:05:57.707 --> 00:06:01.060
champions pee their pants, literally!

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:02.291
(soft chuckle)

00:06:02.291 --> 00:06:04.655
Born to the Air Tribe of the Ashari people,

00:06:04.655 --> 00:06:06.908
Keyleth was raised with a deep love

00:06:06.908 --> 00:06:09.265
of nature and the elemental magics.

00:06:09.265 --> 00:06:11.975
It is her people’s inherent duty to protect the

00:06:11.975 --> 00:06:14.092
delicate areas in Tal'Dorei

00:06:14.092 --> 00:06:17.568
where the four elemental planes begin to bleed with this realm.

00:06:17.568 --> 00:06:20.795
Since she was a little girl, she had quite a knack

00:06:20.795 --> 00:06:23.407
for air manipulation and beast shaping abilities.

00:06:23.407 --> 00:06:26.187
Well, if you consider kittens and

00:06:26.187 --> 00:06:28.496
flying squirrels to be little beasts.

00:06:28.496 --> 00:06:30.340
Which, I do.

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:31.363
(clears throat)

00:06:31.363 --> 00:06:34.282
Anyways, it wasn't long before the headmaster of the tribe,

00:06:34.282 --> 00:06:35.892
her father, Kohren,

00:06:35.892 --> 00:06:38.368
realized her true prodigious abilities and

00:06:38.368 --> 00:06:42.042
she was inveterated to succeed him as the next headmaster.

00:06:42.042 --> 00:06:45.569
Just like that, her jovial childhood was stripped and

00:06:45.569 --> 00:06:48.072
replaced with endless spell memorization,

00:06:48.072 --> 00:06:49.700
teachings from ancient traditions,

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:52.132
and exceedingly high expectations.

00:06:52.132 --> 00:06:55.436
Every druid leader to be must embark on a journey

00:06:55.436 --> 00:06:57.027
to seek out the sister tribes

00:06:57.027 --> 00:06:59.391
in order to introduce and establish respect

00:06:59.391 --> 00:07:01.221
amongst the fellow headmasters.

00:07:01.221 --> 00:07:05.322
They call this the Aramente, or Noble Odyssey.

00:07:05.322 --> 00:07:08.733
When her father felt she was ready, he set her on the path

00:07:08.733 --> 00:07:10.674
to truly discovering herself.

00:07:10.674 --> 00:07:13.967
Not knowing when, or if she will ever return.

00:07:13.967 --> 00:07:16.854
As she hiked down the mountain towards Stillben,

00:07:16.854 --> 00:07:19.160
she meditated on the task ahead.

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:22.159
Part of the Aramente is proving yourself

00:07:22.159 --> 00:07:24.347
a strong warrior, a valiant protector,

00:07:24.347 --> 00:07:26.910
and a wise and compassionate leader.

00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:29.962
With this knowledge, one thought plays

00:07:29.962 --> 00:07:31.345
in repeat in her mind:

00:07:31.345 --> 00:07:34.468
Is she even worthy?

00:07:36.968 --> 00:07:39.146
TALIESIN: Percy was the third child of 7 children,

00:07:39.146 --> 00:07:41.188
born to a noble family who lived far to the

00:07:41.188 --> 00:07:44.182
north in the ancient castle of Whitestone.

00:07:44.182 --> 00:07:46.648
With so many siblings to share the burdens of

00:07:46.648 --> 00:07:49.040
lordship, Percy turned his attention to the

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:52.101
sciences, engineering, and naturalism.

00:07:52.101 --> 00:07:54.694
One day, a mysterious couple,

00:07:54.694 --> 00:07:57.423
named Lord and Lady Briarwood, came to court.

00:07:57.423 --> 00:08:00.133
During a feast held in their honor,

00:08:00.133 --> 00:08:02.384
the Briarwoods violently took control of the castle,

00:08:02.384 --> 00:08:06.118
killing or imprisoning everyone who would stand in their way.

00:08:06.118 --> 00:08:08.550
Percy awoke chained in the dungeon,

00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:10.924
only to be freed by his younger sister.

00:08:10.924 --> 00:08:14.431
Together they fled, chased by the Briarwoods’ men.

00:08:14.431 --> 00:08:17.333
As they ran, Percy’s sister took

00:08:17.333 --> 00:08:19.417
several arrows to the chest and fell.

00:08:19.417 --> 00:08:22.321
Percy kept running, eventually jumping into

00:08:22.321 --> 00:08:25.504
a freezing river and floating unconscious to freedom.

00:08:25.504 --> 00:08:28.938
He did not remember waking up on a fishing boat.

00:08:28.938 --> 00:08:31.243
He barely remembered the next two years, as he

00:08:31.243 --> 00:08:34.625
slowly made his way as far south as possible.

00:08:34.635 --> 00:08:37.169
Then one night, Percy had a dream.

00:08:37.169 --> 00:08:39.865
A roaring cloud of smoke offered him

00:08:39.865 --> 00:08:42.794
vengeance against those who destroyed his family.

00:08:42.794 --> 00:08:47.165
When he awoke, Percy began to design his first gun.

00:08:47.165 --> 00:08:49.585
(sound of a gun cocking and firing)

00:08:50.165 --> 00:08:53.692
SAM: Oh, you haven’t heard of Scanlan Shorthalt?

00:08:53.692 --> 00:08:55.504
Well, gird your loins, ladies,

00:08:55.504 --> 00:08:57.466
because he has his eye on you.

00:08:57.466 --> 00:09:00.517
A talented musician, master of disguise, and dashingly

00:09:00.517 --> 00:09:03.472
handsome in his own mind, Scanlan sings songs

00:09:03.472 --> 00:09:06.602
almost as much as he sings his own praises.

00:09:06.602 --> 00:09:10.080
Born a poor gnome, Scanlan used his endless

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:11.803
charm and soaring tenor voice to

00:09:11.803 --> 00:09:14.322
croon for coin and support his single mother.

00:09:14.322 --> 00:09:17.381
One day he was discovered by a half-orc promoter,

00:09:17.381 --> 00:09:21.349
and joined Dr. Dranzel’s Spectacular Traveling Troupe

00:09:21.349 --> 00:09:23.378
where he learned the ways of the world,

00:09:23.378 --> 00:09:27.395
and honed his skills as a bard extraordinaire.

00:09:27.395 --> 00:09:29.960
A loner much of his life, Scanlan has never quite

00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:31.655
come to terms with the violent death

00:09:31.655 --> 00:09:33.921
of his mother at the hands of a goblin invasion.

00:09:33.921 --> 00:09:38.091
While his years on the road provided many, shall we say,

00:09:38.091 --> 00:09:41.350
educational experiences with the opposite sex,

00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:43.951
deep down Scanlan yearns for the one thing

00:09:43.951 --> 00:09:46.163
he’s never known: the true love

00:09:46.163 --> 00:09:47.876
of a fellow gnome.

00:09:47.876 --> 00:09:51.730
Still, Scanlan considers himself a lover first,

00:09:51.730 --> 00:09:55.051
performer second, and fighter distant third.

00:09:55.051 --> 00:09:57.438
On the battlefield, he’ll support his allies,

00:09:57.438 --> 00:10:00.419
but rarely draws blood unless it’s to protect

00:10:00.419 --> 00:10:04.365
fellow gnome, Pike. Count on Scanlan for a hearty laugh,

00:10:04.365 --> 00:10:08.220
a rollicking song, and a twinkle in his eye that melts hearts

00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:10.948
and makes the females swoon.

00:10:14.308 --> 00:10:15.907
ORION: Greetings and salutations.

00:10:15.907 --> 00:10:17.901
I am Tiberius Stormwind.

00:10:17.901 --> 00:10:19.846
I hail from a town called Ty'rex,

00:10:19.846 --> 00:10:21.861
located in the heart of Draconia,

00:10:21.861 --> 00:10:24.397
born from a politically respected family.

00:10:24.397 --> 00:10:27.620
At the age of 15, I succeeded in passing the Sorcerer’s Rite,

00:10:27.620 --> 00:10:30.146
showing prodigy-like control of my magic.

00:10:30.146 --> 00:10:32.790
The judges and the Draconian high council were amazed at

00:10:32.790 --> 00:10:36.186
how powerful my spells were for how long I had been training.

00:10:36.186 --> 00:10:38.971
At 20 years old, I was the youngest appointed member

00:10:38.971 --> 00:10:41.750
of the magic guild in Draconian history. For the

00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:43.800
next few years, I almost went mad from the

00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:45.809
malaise of being a guild member,

00:10:45.809 --> 00:10:47.799
as it’s rather boring.

00:10:47.799 --> 00:10:50.378
However, one day I happened upon a chamber,

00:10:50.378 --> 00:10:52.591
unused for quite some time.

00:10:52.591 --> 00:10:55.026
In the room were stacks of books and maps

00:10:55.026 --> 00:10:56.879
of the surrounding cities and areas

00:10:56.879 --> 00:10:58.375
around the known world.

00:10:58.375 --> 00:11:00.482
For months I would frequent the chamber, and learned

00:11:00.482 --> 00:11:02.256
of artifacts from legend.

00:11:02.256 --> 00:11:05.061
After a long period of research, I made a list of artifacts

00:11:05.061 --> 00:11:06.480
that caught my eye.

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:09.034
I brought these findings to the high council and was told that

00:11:09.034 --> 00:11:11.730
all of the information in the chamber I had stumbled upon

00:11:11.730 --> 00:11:15.398
was either believed to be fiction, or unsolvable mysteries,

00:11:15.398 --> 00:11:17.745
and hence were lost forever.

00:11:17.745 --> 00:11:20.697
I found those answers to be unacceptable.

00:11:20.697 --> 00:11:22.698
A year later I devised a ruse and managed to

00:11:22.698 --> 00:11:25.237
convince the city council to lend support

00:11:25.237 --> 00:11:27.303
in me leaving Draconia on a mission of peace

00:11:27.303 --> 00:11:29.455
and diplomacy for the surrounding kingdoms.

00:11:29.455 --> 00:11:32.035
Going from town to town and making friends and allies,

00:11:32.035 --> 00:11:34.118
in and for the name of Draconia.

00:11:34.118 --> 00:11:35.578
Being a red dragonborn,

00:11:35.578 --> 00:11:38.512
I had quite the task on my hands in that respect,

00:11:38.512 --> 00:11:41.276
but it was exactly what I needed so I could explore

00:11:41.276 --> 00:11:43.329
the world and find these artifacts,

00:11:43.329 --> 00:11:46.124
as I felt the truth was out there.

00:11:46.124 --> 00:11:47.938
Some may describe me as buffoonish,

00:11:47.938 --> 00:11:49.866
but I say poppycock to all that.

00:11:49.866 --> 00:11:53.402
I am much sharper than most give me credit for.

00:11:53.402 --> 00:11:55.754
I just don’t pay attention to things sometimes.

00:11:55.754 --> 00:11:59.222
I’ve also been known to be rather cunning, loyal,

00:11:59.222 --> 00:12:03.240
happy-go-lucky, and well, dangerous.

00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:06.255
I can’t help but show my true scales every now and then.

00:12:06.255 --> 00:12:09.567
But overall, I think I’m quite friendly for a Dragonborn.

00:12:11.467 --> 00:12:13.702
LIAM: Never entirely welcome in the company of

00:12:13.702 --> 00:12:15.492
elves or men, Vax'ildan learned

00:12:15.492 --> 00:12:18.438
at a young age to skip past formality,

00:12:18.438 --> 00:12:21.870
preferring instead to invite himself in your door.

00:12:21.870 --> 00:12:24.268
Along with twin sister Vex'ahlia,

00:12:24.268 --> 00:12:27.101
Vax was born by a chance encounter between elven

00:12:27.101 --> 00:12:30.166
royalty and human peasantry.

00:12:30.166 --> 00:12:33.000
Raised by their mother in their early years, the twins

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:34.546
were eventually sent off to their father

00:12:34.546 --> 00:12:36.766
in the elven capital of Singorn.

00:12:36.766 --> 00:12:39.802
But their cool reception among the elves there never warmed,

00:12:39.802 --> 00:12:42.992
and their time in the capital didn’t last.

00:12:42.992 --> 00:12:46.045
The siblings stole away one autumn night and set out on

00:12:46.045 --> 00:12:47.770
the open road.

00:12:47.770 --> 00:12:50.749
After a few years of wandering, they eventually decided to

00:12:50.749 --> 00:12:52.995
return to their mother, and journeyed

00:12:52.995 --> 00:12:55.122
back to the lands of their youth.

00:12:55.122 --> 00:12:57.485
But instead of finding their childhood home,

00:12:57.485 --> 00:13:00.537
they returned to a pile of rubble.

00:13:00.537 --> 00:13:03.830
Their mother was gone, their home burned to ash.

00:13:03.830 --> 00:13:06.787
Pressing the townspeople for answers,

00:13:06.787 --> 00:13:09.148
they learned of the day the dragon came.

00:13:09.158 --> 00:13:12.418
(dragon roaring)

00:13:12.418 --> 00:13:15.955
With their ties all severed, Vax'ildan and his sister

00:13:15.955 --> 00:13:19.027
set out to find their fortune together in Tal'Dorei.

00:13:19.027 --> 00:13:24.118
An outsider since birth, Vax quickly learned to solve life’s

00:13:24.118 --> 00:13:26.925
challenges in his own particular way,

00:13:26.925 --> 00:13:29.743
often by sidestepping them entirely.

00:13:29.743 --> 00:13:32.493
And when his knack for circumventing adversity isn’t enough,

00:13:32.493 --> 00:13:34.853
(ringing weapons SFX)

00:13:34.853 --> 00:13:37.652
the way of blades the elves schooled him in

00:13:37.652 --> 00:13:39.872
more than makes up the difference.

00:13:40.772 --> 00:13:42.749
LAURA: Like so many half-elves,

00:13:42.749 --> 00:13:45.737
Vex'ahlia has spent most of her life suffering

00:13:45.737 --> 00:13:50.017
the cool reception of a people who don’t fully accept her.

00:13:50.017 --> 00:13:54.098
Born of a human mother, and an elven father 
who only later in life

00:13:54.098 --> 00:13:56.639
took an interest in their existence,

00:13:56.639 --> 00:13:59.792
Vex'ahlia and her twin brother Vax'ildan quickly

00:13:59.792 --> 00:14:03.080
realized the only people they could truly rely on

00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:06.524
in this world were each other.

00:14:06.524 --> 00:14:09.633
It was at the age of 10 when the two were taken from their mother,

00:14:09.633 --> 00:14:11.832
and brought to live in Singorn,

00:14:11.832 --> 00:14:15.991
the isolated elven city for which their father 
was an ambassador.

00:14:15.991 --> 00:14:19.680
He quietly took them in, but always kept an icy distance,

00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:22.574
and after too many years of disdainful looks,

00:14:22.574 --> 00:14:26.109
the pair decided to leave his indifference behind,

00:14:26.109 --> 00:14:28.955
and set out on their own.

00:14:28.955 --> 00:14:32.814
Vax took to the cities, stealing small trinkets and

00:14:32.814 --> 00:14:34.470
learning the ways of the thief,

00:14:34.470 --> 00:14:37.720
while Vex kept to the woods.

00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:40.442
She preferred the isolation.

00:14:40.442 --> 00:14:44.313
Always the keen observer, she learned to hunt and to track,

00:14:44.313 --> 00:14:46.865
to spy and to shoot.

00:14:46.865 --> 00:14:49.264
And through a series of fateful events,

00:14:49.264 --> 00:14:52.977
earned herself a companion in the form of a bear -

00:14:52.994 --> 00:14:55.254
her own stolen Trinket -

00:14:55.254 --> 00:14:59.194
to fight alongside her and protect her fiercely.

00:14:59.194 --> 00:15:03.905
Also he is adorable, and gives expert massages.

00:15:04.875 --> 00:15:07.676
MATT: Welcome back, everyone! The new intro tonight,

00:15:07.676 --> 00:15:09.951
which I think we're all pretty damn proud of,

00:15:09.951 --> 00:15:13.342
was put together by our fantastic overlord, Zac.

00:15:13.342 --> 00:15:19.460
(all cheering)

00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:22.095
MATT: It put him to work for quite some time,

00:15:22.095 --> 00:15:24.038
also the mixing and sound effects done by

00:15:24.038 --> 00:15:25.976
the amazing Alex Neat and the music you heard

00:15:25.976 --> 00:15:29.360
was composed by the amazingly talented 
Jason Charles Miller.

00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:32.658
So if you don't know Jason you should look him up.

00:15:32.658 --> 00:15:34.593
He's done stuff for The Guild and many other web shows.

00:15:34.593 --> 00:15:36.965
Also a fantastic musician on his own with his own stuff.

00:15:36.965 --> 00:15:38.152
He is the lead singer of Godhead.

00:15:38.152 --> 00:15:39.813
He's just a good guy.

00:15:39.813 --> 00:15:43.950
Also a voice actor, look him up if you have any time.

00:15:43.950 --> 00:15:46.009
Good people, and he lent his talents to our intro

00:15:46.009 --> 00:15:47.687
so we really appreciate that, buddy.

00:15:49.857 --> 00:15:52.672
Also we had a great time at Tabletop Day.

00:15:52.672 --> 00:15:54.453
Got to meet some of our fans.

00:15:54.453 --> 00:15:55.942
Got to take some pictures.

00:15:55.942 --> 00:15:56.821
Bunch of cool folks.

00:15:56.821 --> 00:15:58.616
Some of us got to go on the stream

00:15:58.616 --> 00:15:59.889
at certain points in the day.

00:15:59.889 --> 00:16:01.133
All around a good time!

00:16:01.133 --> 00:16:02.468
So those of you that got a chance to come,

00:16:02.468 --> 00:16:04.085
thank you so much!

00:16:04.085 --> 00:16:05.926
And a fan created, as I mentioned before,

00:16:05.926 --> 00:16:07.240
this awesome t-shirt with the roster,

00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:08.832
so we were all really inspired to go ahead

00:16:08.832 --> 00:16:11.608
and make some of our own.

00:16:11.608 --> 00:16:17.256
Got the party showing off their Critical Role positive.

00:16:17.256 --> 00:16:19.372
MARISHA: So one of the things

00:16:19.372 --> 00:16:21.186
we were actually talking about doing,

00:16:21.186 --> 00:16:29.656
so we'd like to give a shout out to the person who made this,

00:16:29.656 --> 00:16:31.572
big shout out to @RuzGofDi.

00:16:31.572 --> 00:16:33.448
Thank you! For doing this.

00:16:33.448 --> 00:16:38.058
A lot of people have been asking for shirts.

00:16:38.058 --> 00:16:41.371
I don't know if you guys maybe would be into that or not.

00:16:41.371 --> 00:16:43.614
So we thought maybe we would wear these,

00:16:43.614 --> 00:16:45.294
see what you guys thought.

00:16:45.294 --> 00:16:47.878
But if you guys are into it,

00:16:47.878 --> 00:16:50.405
we thought about doing a limited run of these

00:16:50.405 --> 00:16:56.436
and making this the first of our fan-designed t shirts.

00:16:56.436 --> 00:16:57.839
SAM: First of many.

00:16:57.839 --> 00:16:59.419
MARISHA: First of many.

00:16:59.419 --> 00:17:02.794
Every once in awhile we'll have fans submit designs

00:17:02.794 --> 00:17:05.006
and then we'll pick a winner.

00:17:05.006 --> 00:17:06.863
Each one will be a limited run.

00:17:06.863 --> 00:17:09.819
So if you guys will like this, let us know,

00:17:09.819 --> 00:17:12.001
and maybe we'll make it happen.

00:17:12.001 --> 00:17:14.441
SAM: I'm wearing one right now in my underpants,

00:17:14.441 --> 00:17:16.270
which we will be selling next week.

00:17:16.270 --> 00:17:20.148
MARISHA: Yes, and there might be some stills 
of that to order.

00:17:20.148 --> 00:17:22.333
ORION: I'm going to wear mine next game.

00:17:22.333 --> 00:17:23.137
TALIESIN: Next game.

00:17:23.137 --> 00:17:26.655
MATT: I guess some people are into the idea,

00:17:26.655 --> 00:17:28.209
let the chat know.

00:17:28.209 --> 00:17:29.938
People seem to be, and we'll be putting more designs out,

00:17:29.938 --> 00:17:33.275
getting some shirt possibilities to you guys in the near future.

00:17:33.275 --> 00:17:35.903
MARISHA: Let us know in the chat guys.

00:17:35.903 --> 00:17:39.340
LIAM: Wait wait wait, I've got some thing.

00:17:39.340 --> 00:17:44.259
I just gave everyone in the party rupees, treasure!

00:17:44.259 --> 00:17:46.083
MARISHA: Rupees!

00:17:46.083 --> 00:17:48.150
LIAM: These were sent to me by Tim West

00:17:48.150 --> 00:17:51.925
who has a great new company called Fantasy Coin HQ.

00:17:51.925 --> 00:17:55.067
If you go to fantasycoinhq.com he makes -

00:17:55.067 --> 00:17:57.603
Matt's holding up a dwarven coin at the moment -

00:17:57.603 --> 00:18:00.973
they make gems, they make fantasy coins, nerd coins.

00:18:00.973 --> 00:18:02.987
SAM: Are we doing free ads now for people?

00:18:02.987 --> 00:18:04.231
LIAM: This is just a thank you!

00:18:04.231 --> 00:18:05.526
MATT: This is a thank you.

00:18:05.526 --> 00:18:06.684
LIAM: Check it out.

00:18:06.684 --> 00:18:10.840
Or if you just hit a really tall tuft of grass with a sword,

00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:13.318
these will pop out of it so you don't have to order them.

00:18:13.318 --> 00:18:14.800
Just mow your lawn.

00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:16.365
MARISHA: They’re hefty, too.

00:18:16.365 --> 00:18:22.239
ORION: If these were rupees, this is what they would feel like.

00:18:22.239 --> 00:18:24.836
MARISHA: I kind of want to throw them at people

00:18:24.836 --> 00:18:26.266
across the room!

00:18:26.266 --> 00:18:29.162
ORION: I want to trade them, put them in a pouch.

00:18:29.162 --> 00:18:32.499
MATT: Also guys, as a note, we have,

00:18:32.499 --> 00:18:34.877
available tonight for the person,

00:18:34.877 --> 00:18:36.600
for people who have managed to get themselves

00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:38.746
to 2,150 subscribers tonight,

00:18:38.746 --> 00:18:40.800
we will send out another promo kit

00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:42.360
to one of you folks in the chat

00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:45.011
with another signed picture of our Critical Role cast.

00:18:45.011 --> 00:18:47.527
So be sure to see if we can get the subscribers

00:18:47.527 --> 00:18:49.010
to climb up as well,

00:18:49.010 --> 00:18:50.543
so keep an eye out for that in the evening

00:18:50.543 --> 00:18:52.440
so we can give out one of those before the night is over.

00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:54.555
That would be awesome.

00:18:54.555 --> 00:18:55.874
SAM: Let's do this!

00:18:55.874 --> 00:18:58.846
MATT: Let's kick into the game proper, guys!

00:18:58.846 --> 00:19:02.736
Let's get some proper music playing, 
because that's what I do.

00:19:02.736 --> 00:19:05.198
ORION: That’s what I baby do right.

00:19:05.198 --> 00:19:08.115
SAM: (Beatboxing)

00:19:08.115 --> 00:19:12.944
MATT: So last we left off, music's not playing here.

00:19:12.944 --> 00:19:14.286
I need music!

00:19:14.286 --> 00:19:16.437
SAM: Doesn't matter.
MATT: The music's important to me!

00:19:16.437 --> 00:19:18.793
The party had been travelling

00:19:18.793 --> 00:19:20.915
into the dwarven city of Kraghammer

00:19:20.915 --> 00:19:22.959
at the behest of arcanist Allura Vysoren

00:19:22.959 --> 00:19:26.491
in search of a halfling paladin,

00:19:26.491 --> 00:19:29.216
a very revered folk hero named Lady Kima of Vord

00:19:29.216 --> 00:19:31.122
who had gone missing following a vision quest

00:19:31.122 --> 00:19:33.550
somewhere beneath the dwarven city of Kraghammer,

00:19:33.550 --> 00:19:35.759
supposedly for some great evil that was germinating there,

00:19:35.759 --> 00:19:37.568
festering and growing.

00:19:37.568 --> 00:19:39.600
After you guys traversed through the dwarven city,

00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:42.396
you began to find your way down into the mines.

00:19:42.396 --> 00:19:45.710
The mythril mines of Greyspine beneath the dwarven town.

00:19:45.710 --> 00:19:49.366
After a few fateful encounters, the return of your gnome cleric.

00:19:50.076 --> 00:19:52.766
ASHLEY: Hey, that's me!

00:19:52.766 --> 00:19:55.850
MATT: Grog having his proverbial brains blown out

00:19:55.850 --> 00:19:58.498
by an intellect devourer.

00:19:58.498 --> 00:20:03.076
The party then decided to make friends with a mind flayer,

00:20:03.076 --> 00:20:04.967
an illithid that had been cast out from its people

00:20:04.967 --> 00:20:09.354
seeking vengeance and possible return to its people.

00:20:09.354 --> 00:20:10.878
Upon making this alliance,

00:20:10.878 --> 00:20:13.490
they made an attack on the dwarven, or the duergar,

00:20:13.490 --> 00:20:15.895
war camp that is threatening to rise up

00:20:15.895 --> 00:20:17.363
and attack Kraghammer

00:20:17.363 --> 00:20:19.436
from deep within the mountains themselves.

00:20:19.436 --> 00:20:21.070
The attack was successful.

00:20:21.070 --> 00:20:22.234
The general was killed, interrogated,

00:20:22.234 --> 00:20:23.998
and some interesting information was gleaned from him

00:20:23.998 --> 00:20:26.282
before his brain was sucked out from his head

00:20:26.282 --> 00:20:28.945
by Clarota, the mindflayer friend.

00:20:28.945 --> 00:20:32.680
However, this attack also announced to the local war camp

00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:35.134
of your presence and in the process of attempting 
to escape,

00:20:35.134 --> 00:20:39.270
the druid was damaged and lost her eagle form

00:20:39.270 --> 00:20:41.956
and thus began a freefall of many party members.

00:20:41.956 --> 00:20:44.255
A haphazard attempt to use the magic carpet

00:20:44.271 --> 00:20:47.421
far over its weight limit led most of the party

00:20:47.421 --> 00:20:50.205
to come crash landing and nearly killing everyone.

00:20:51.255 --> 00:20:52.406
Managed to escape,

00:20:52.406 --> 00:20:56.025
walled themselves in thanks to 
Keyleth’s stone wall spell.

00:20:56.025 --> 00:20:58.239
And after staying the evening in one 
of the deeper tunnels,

00:20:58.239 --> 00:21:01.785
and barely avoiding a roving band of duergar there,

00:21:01.785 --> 00:21:03.788
you managed to find yourselves in battle with 2 ogres

00:21:03.788 --> 00:21:07.843
carrying some sort of strange, mutated, 
black pudding ooze

00:21:07.843 --> 00:21:09.283
contained in a glass container.

00:21:09.283 --> 00:21:10.997
The glass container being shattered, of course,

00:21:10.997 --> 00:21:13.869
by an explosive arrow created by Percy and fired by Vex.

00:21:13.869 --> 00:21:14.894
LAURA: Go us!

00:21:14.894 --> 00:21:16.773
MATT: At the very start of the battle,

00:21:16.773 --> 00:21:18.475
led into a very rough battle

00:21:18.475 --> 00:21:19.855
with this strange mutating ooze

00:21:19.855 --> 00:21:21.690
that kept splitting and splitting,

00:21:21.690 --> 00:21:24.923
until through some good teamwork,

00:21:24.923 --> 00:21:26.959
crafty use of telekinesis and a nearby lava pool,

00:21:26.959 --> 00:21:29.972
and general high damage rolls,

00:21:29.972 --> 00:21:31.512
you guys managed to survive the encounter.

00:21:31.512 --> 00:21:32.204
TRAVIS: Barely.

00:21:32.204 --> 00:21:33.954
MATT: Making your way to the bottom of this tunnel,

00:21:33.954 --> 00:21:36.884
you found yourself looping back around

00:21:36.884 --> 00:21:38.335
to the large crevice

00:21:38.335 --> 00:21:39.869
where the giant waterfall had fallen in before,

00:21:39.869 --> 00:21:41.403
where you had met Clarota.

00:21:41.403 --> 00:21:43.228
Which allowed you to retrieve your bear Trinket.

00:21:43.228 --> 00:21:45.504
LAURA: Yeah! Trinket!

00:21:45.504 --> 00:21:48.271
MATT: We pick up as you guys begin to step down

00:21:48.271 --> 00:21:50.889
into the lower tunnels,

00:21:50.889 --> 00:21:53.169
the ones that are partially coated

00:21:53.169 --> 00:21:56.083
with a series of magma pools and falls

00:21:56.083 --> 00:21:58.913
that are trickling out of the rockside.

00:21:58.913 --> 00:22:00.319
All right everyone.

00:22:04.249 --> 00:22:09.537
SAM: I was just so out of it last time.

00:22:09.537 --> 00:22:10.952
Have we rested?

00:22:10.952 --> 00:22:12.631
Are we in some need of rest?

00:22:12.631 --> 00:22:14.162
LAURA: We should probably rest.

00:22:14.162 --> 00:22:15.448
SAM: What are we around?

00:22:15.448 --> 00:22:16.612
What's near us?

00:22:16.612 --> 00:22:17.974
Is this just a tunnel?

00:22:17.974 --> 00:22:19.686
Is there any sort of shelter, caves?

00:22:19.686 --> 00:22:22.528
LAURA: We're by that lake with the giant monster.

00:22:22.528 --> 00:22:24.340
LIAM: We circled all the way back around.

00:22:24.340 --> 00:22:25.415
SAM: Oh shit.

00:22:25.415 --> 00:22:26.514
LAURA: And went down to that place

00:22:26.514 --> 00:22:27.786
that you told us not to go in the first place?

00:22:27.786 --> 00:22:29.487
Yeah, that's where we ended up.

00:22:29.487 --> 00:22:31.155
SAM: How was that for you?

00:22:31.155 --> 00:22:32.941
(all laugh)

00:22:34.081 --> 00:22:35.592
MATT: So essentially there was--

00:22:35.592 --> 00:22:37.496
SAM: We're back in the camp.

00:22:37.496 --> 00:22:38.553
MATT: You're under the camp.

00:22:38.553 --> 00:22:41.269
You're where the giant chasm leads down into the waterfall.

00:22:41.269 --> 00:22:42.707
There is a pool of water at the bottom

00:22:42.707 --> 00:22:44.312
where the aboleth was in the water.

00:22:44.312 --> 00:22:45.559
LIAM: We just barely survived the chat room

00:22:45.559 --> 00:22:47.229
and now we need to rest.

00:22:47.229 --> 00:22:49.937
TRAVIS: (chuckles) The chatroom.

00:22:49.937 --> 00:22:51.742
Take it easy on us, all right?

00:22:51.742 --> 00:22:53.645
MATT: You guys also just woke up about 2, 3 hours ago.

00:22:53.645 --> 00:22:56.347
LAURA: Right, so we don't really -

00:22:56.347 --> 00:22:57.620
oh, we can take hit points.

00:22:57.620 --> 00:22:59.270
MATT: You guys can take a short rest

00:22:59.270 --> 00:23:01.329
and use your hit dice to heal up.

00:23:01.329 --> 00:23:02.907
You didn't take any damage last game.

00:23:02.907 --> 00:23:04.077
Thankfully you stayed out of the fray.

00:23:04.077 --> 00:23:04.989
SAM: So I'm okay.

00:23:04.989 --> 00:23:06.146
That's all I need to know.

00:23:08.066 --> 00:23:11.979
MATT: You did use one of your Dominate spells.

00:23:11.979 --> 00:23:12.985
SAM: Okay.

00:23:12.985 --> 00:23:14.457
MATT: Only thing of note.

00:23:15.777 --> 00:23:17.036
So the rest of you who need to heal up

00:23:17.036 --> 00:23:18.533
can use this time to take a short rest

00:23:18.533 --> 00:23:20.327
and use your hit dice to heal up on your own.

00:23:22.417 --> 00:23:23.485
TRAVIS: I'm ready.

00:23:23.485 --> 00:23:24.658
Who we fighting next?

00:23:24.658 --> 00:23:26.228
SAM: Anyone need some healing?

00:23:26.228 --> 00:23:27.678
Are we all okay? Are we all good?

00:23:27.678 --> 00:23:28.732
ASHLEY: I think we're all good.

00:23:28.732 --> 00:23:31.261
Where's everybody at in terms of...

00:23:31.261 --> 00:23:33.833
ORION: Well, I'm fine.

00:23:33.833 --> 00:23:36.149
LAURA: On a personal level, or?

00:23:36.149 --> 00:23:38.581
ASHLEY: You mean like in life, or?

00:23:40.517 --> 00:23:43.160
SAM: As we survey the area,

00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:44.907
how many tunnels we looking at?

00:23:44.907 --> 00:23:46.520
What's our options here?

00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:47.372
MATT: So,

00:23:47.372 --> 00:23:50.460
(all laugh)

00:23:50.460 --> 00:23:51.732
TRAVIS: He's back, he's back.

00:23:51.732 --> 00:23:54.480
ORION: Would you calm down?

00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:57.120
MATT: Let me pull out this visual aid for you.

00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:00.866
This is the tunnel sequence

00:24:00.866 --> 00:24:02.831
you guys have traversed down to the main area

00:24:02.831 --> 00:24:04.466
where the goblin encampment was.

00:24:04.466 --> 00:24:06.354
This is the large bridge that went across the giant chasm

00:24:06.354 --> 00:24:08.251
to where the duergar war camp was.

00:24:08.251 --> 00:24:11.981
This is the giant drop-off at the waterfall.

00:24:11.981 --> 00:24:13.870
You guys are currently in this section

00:24:13.870 --> 00:24:15.228
about to go deeper into this tunnel

00:24:15.228 --> 00:24:17.768
where a series of small magma trickles are pouring

00:24:17.768 --> 00:24:19.533
out of the rock.

00:24:19.533 --> 00:24:22.579
SAM: So we never went up to the war camp and through it.

00:24:22.588 --> 00:24:23.706
MATT: You did.

00:24:23.706 --> 00:24:25.136
SAM: Oh we did!

00:24:25.136 --> 00:24:27.120
LIAM: We crashed down by the tunnel, we fled.

00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:30.868
We sealed up the way behind us, ran in.

00:24:30.868 --> 00:24:33.961
SAM: Got it. So we should keep going?

00:24:33.961 --> 00:24:35.340
We should just keep going.

00:24:35.340 --> 00:24:37.304
Magma? Follow the magma.

00:24:37.304 --> 00:24:38.736
LIAM: Well I recommend.

00:24:38.736 --> 00:24:41.551
We don't want to go up and through the camp again?

00:24:41.551 --> 00:24:42.974
LAURA: No no no, we're going into the cavern.

00:24:42.974 --> 00:24:44.347
LIAM: So we're going to backtrack the way we came

00:24:44.347 --> 00:24:46.325
to that war camp road, yes?

00:24:46.325 --> 00:24:48.839
LAURA: No, we're going into the tunnel.

00:24:48.839 --> 00:24:50.889
SAM: Did you see the visual aid?

00:24:50.889 --> 00:24:52.562
ORION: Yes, we are going into the lava tunnel.

00:24:52.562 --> 00:24:54.005
LAURA: No no no, in through the tunnel.

00:24:54.005 --> 00:24:55.600
LIAM: I’ll just follow. I thought I understood.

00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:57.271
MATT: (laughs) It’s been a week.

00:24:57.271 --> 00:24:58.561
SAM: I mean there might be something to be gleaned

00:24:58.561 --> 00:25:00.165
from going back to the war camp.

00:25:00.165 --> 00:25:01.430
LAURA: That tunnel.

00:25:01.430 --> 00:25:02.531
LIAM: We went out of there.

00:25:02.531 --> 00:25:03.386
LAURA: No no no no no.

00:25:03.386 --> 00:25:04.900
MATT: You guys came through here,

00:25:04.900 --> 00:25:06.284
you traveled across over the war camp,

00:25:06.284 --> 00:25:08.664
went back here and tunneled below.

00:25:08.664 --> 00:25:10.422
LAURA: And popped this out right there.

00:25:10.422 --> 00:25:11.652
So now we're going into this.

00:25:11.652 --> 00:25:13.184
MATT: Correct. Maps.

00:25:13.184 --> 00:25:17.012
LIAM: And just to make sure that my memory is on point--

00:25:17.012 --> 00:25:18.101
TRAVIS: It's not.

00:25:18.101 --> 00:25:20.146
LIAM: --Before we circled back around,

00:25:20.146 --> 00:25:22.572
we hit a fork in the road where we could have gone up

00:25:22.572 --> 00:25:23.603
and we could have gone down.

00:25:23.603 --> 00:25:24.694
MATT: Correct.

00:25:24.694 --> 00:25:25.935
LIAM: So that's behind us.

00:25:25.935 --> 00:25:28.545
LAURA: That's behind us, we're going down down down.

00:25:28.545 --> 00:25:29.595
LIAM: Cheers.

00:25:29.595 --> 00:25:33.165
MATT: Cheers indeed, huzzah. All right.

00:25:33.165 --> 00:25:34.304
LAURA: Shall we?

00:25:35.484 --> 00:25:37.030
ASHLEY: We shall!

00:25:37.030 --> 00:25:40.113
SAM: Is Clarence with us still?

00:25:40.113 --> 00:25:42.583
MATT: Clarota is indeed with you.

00:25:42.583 --> 00:25:46.541
Clarota took a large black iron duergar bolt

00:25:46.541 --> 00:25:49.541
to the chest earlier and is mostly recovered

00:25:49.541 --> 00:25:52.376
but is still even more hunched than usual.

00:25:52.376 --> 00:25:53.665
LAURA: Does he need healing?

00:25:53.665 --> 00:25:55.204
ASHLEY: He also ate those brains.

00:25:55.204 --> 00:25:56.394
MATT: The brains helped him--

00:25:56.394 --> 00:25:57.609
ASHLEY: Helped him a little bit?

00:25:57.609 --> 00:25:59.671
MATT: --keep healthy, but he's still a little wounded

00:25:59.671 --> 00:26:01.204
but he's taking his time to rest up.

00:26:01.204 --> 00:26:02.662
He seems to be okay.

00:26:02.662 --> 00:26:04.915
Not as worse for wear as he was before.

00:26:04.915 --> 00:26:09.072
A slight wheeze that's always to him still present.

00:26:09.072 --> 00:26:12.024
ASHLEY: He's just always a little weezy.

00:26:12.024 --> 00:26:14.102
LAURA &amp;amp; LIAM: (meh meh meh sounds)

00:26:14.102 --> 00:26:16.052
MATT: Sounds just like that.

00:26:16.052 --> 00:26:21.461
So, as you guys begin to push down into this lower chasm,

00:26:21.461 --> 00:26:25.110
the temperature of the air itself

00:26:25.110 --> 00:26:29.048
grows steadily warmer and warmer with a drier heat.

00:26:29.048 --> 00:26:30.351
ORION: This feels nice.

00:26:30.351 --> 00:26:31.945
MATT: You find yourselves, especially those of you

00:26:31.945 --> 00:26:33.155
with thick armor--

00:26:33.155 --> 00:26:34.875
ASHLEY: Oh, it's so hot!

00:26:34.875 --> 00:26:36.994
MATT: --You find that sweat beads begin to 
trickle down the side of your face--

00:26:36.994 --> 00:26:37.930
ASHLEY: I'm sweating!

00:26:37.930 --> 00:26:39.005
MARISHA: You're all glisteny!

00:26:39.005 --> 00:26:41.280
MATT: --And begin to pool and gather
in parts of your chestplate.

00:26:41.280 --> 00:26:43.210
SAM: Pike, if you'd like me to hold your armor

00:26:43.210 --> 00:26:45.276
or do you want me to take it off for a little while?

00:26:45.276 --> 00:26:47.238
ASHLEY: No, I'll keep it on just for safety.

00:26:47.238 --> 00:26:49.260
SAM: Let it hang out a little bit?

00:26:49.260 --> 00:26:52.215
LIAM: Do you even lift, bro?

00:26:52.215 --> 00:26:54.675
SAM: Just saying, you might feel more comfortable

00:26:54.675 --> 00:26:57.610
with a loose fitting sort of cloak?

00:26:57.610 --> 00:26:58.914
LAURA: Scanlan, stop being creepy!

00:26:58.914 --> 00:27:01.241
SAM: I'm not creepy! I'm just trying to be mindful!

00:27:01.241 --> 00:27:02.595
ASHLEY: No, it's fine Scanlan.

00:27:02.595 --> 00:27:04.807
TRAVIS: Very considerate of you, a gentleman's offer.

00:27:04.807 --> 00:27:06.660
ASHLEY: Yeah, it’s okay. I'll keep it on.

00:27:06.660 --> 00:27:08.270
SAM: I'll just have to use my imagination.

00:27:08.270 --> 00:27:10.397
MARISHA: A gentleman's offer, yes.

00:27:10.397 --> 00:27:12.547
That's what we'll call it from now on.

00:27:12.547 --> 00:27:14.258
TRAVIS: What permission?

00:27:14.258 --> 00:27:15.538
SAM: Onward.

00:27:15.538 --> 00:27:17.555
MATT: Pressing further down, the air itself that once

00:27:17.555 --> 00:27:19.713
had a kind of a hint of that sulfur smell,

00:27:19.713 --> 00:27:21.835
is now becoming stronger and stronger as you step

00:27:21.835 --> 00:27:23.992
deeper and deeper into this cavernous tunnel.

00:27:23.992 --> 00:27:27.921
It rests about 30 feet to 40 feet at width and about

00:27:27.921 --> 00:27:32.493
25, 30 feet up and it varies to come pinched tighter

00:27:32.493 --> 00:27:34.756
or wider at moments, but it continues to be

00:27:34.756 --> 00:27:39.156
a steady downward climb in a continuous direction.

00:27:39.156 --> 00:27:41.210
The small trickles, some of them pool

00:27:41.210 --> 00:27:47.271
and gather into these small, magma cups if you will.

00:27:47.271 --> 00:27:51.098
Molten hot magma, I knew it was coming.

00:27:51.098 --> 00:27:54.028
ORION: (murmurs) I was just wondering if it would happen.

00:27:54.028 --> 00:27:56.392
MATT: Ooh, that's minus 200 experience points.

00:27:56.392 --> 00:27:57.993
(all laugh)

00:27:57.993 --> 00:28:01.315
ORION: I feel a bit weaker now.

00:28:04.885 --> 00:28:09.563
MATT: You get about 20 or 30 minutes deeper into this 
tunnel

00:28:09.563 --> 00:28:13.603
before the sweltering heat gets noticeably warmer

00:28:13.603 --> 00:28:17.046
and as you crest a slight incline and decline

00:28:17.046 --> 00:28:19.611
over a small hill portion of this tunnel,

00:28:19.611 --> 00:28:21.883
you can see now a large portion of the rock has

00:28:21.883 --> 00:28:26.496
collapsed on the left side and a gargantuan pool of magma

00:28:26.496 --> 00:28:29.898
is pooling into the tunnel, essentially covering

00:28:29.898 --> 00:28:31.715
half of the tunnel you are traversing down.

00:28:31.715 --> 00:28:35.527
It can be walked on the side of safely at about 2 or 3

00:28:35.527 --> 00:28:38.605
at shoulder width, but you only have about 
a 15 foot width here

00:28:38.605 --> 00:28:43.444
and the rest of it is just extremely bright, hot, molten rock.

00:28:43.444 --> 00:28:44.850
LAURA: Does it hurt us to get near it?

00:28:44.850 --> 00:28:46.604
MATT: No, but it's uncomfortable and something

00:28:46.604 --> 00:28:48.190
to be very aware of and to watch your step.

00:28:48.190 --> 00:28:49.193
ORION: I feel great!

00:28:49.193 --> 00:28:50.004
MATT: You feel great.

00:28:50.004 --> 00:28:52.328
LIAM: I would just like to point out that we're 9 adults playing

00:28:52.328 --> 00:28:54.298
don't touch the hot lava at the moment.

00:28:54.298 --> 00:28:56.277
(all laugh)

00:28:58.177 --> 00:29:01.246
SAM: Keyleth, you don't have any way of -

00:29:01.246 --> 00:29:03.292
say it gets hotter than this?

00:29:03.292 --> 00:29:06.009
You don't have any way of getting some water out here?

00:29:06.009 --> 00:29:09.378
ORION: Ooh! I do! And I pull out an empty bottle.

00:29:09.378 --> 00:29:13.887
LAURA: Oh? Oh?

00:29:13.887 --> 00:29:17.303
LIAM: Tiberius, I've seen that bottle a lot. What does it do?

00:29:17.303 --> 00:29:20.718
ORION: Oh! Um well, uh. I pull out two bottles.

00:29:21.454 --> 00:29:24.044
This one - they're both empty bottles -

00:29:24.044 --> 00:29:27.314
but this one is an air bottle and this one is a water bottle.

00:29:28.505 --> 00:29:30.675
LIAM: Oh! Thank you! That clears that up!

00:29:30.675 --> 00:29:34.025
(all laugh)

00:29:34.025 --> 00:29:36.822
TRAVIS: Even I feel dumber right now.

00:29:36.822 --> 00:29:38.280
(all laugh)

00:29:38.280 --> 00:29:40.013
SAM: Your intelligence is now 4.

00:29:40.013 --> 00:29:40.875
(all laugh)

00:29:40.875 --> 00:29:42.163
TRAVIS: 4...3 and a half.

00:29:42.163 --> 00:29:43.874
LIAM: Does it make a lot of water?

00:29:43.874 --> 00:29:49.056
ORION: Oh! This, if we ever need air--

00:29:49.056 --> 00:29:52.108
SAM: I think that's the water one that you just pulled out.

00:29:52.108 --> 00:29:54.597
ORION: I take it out (wind SFX).

00:29:54.597 --> 00:29:56.473
I control a small gust.

00:29:56.473 --> 00:29:58.805
LAURA: Yes, but what about water?

00:30:00.819 --> 00:30:01.702
Oh my.

00:30:02.442 --> 00:30:05.319
ORION: This, if we need water -

00:30:05.319 --> 00:30:07.181
And I do a small stream.

00:30:07.181 --> 00:30:09.661
MATT: Okay. So a little bit of water just begins to pour perpetually,

00:30:09.661 --> 00:30:11.930
and without seeming end due to the size of the bottle.

00:30:11.930 --> 00:30:13.280
SAM: It's like a piss stream!

00:30:13.280 --> 00:30:14.383
LAURA: Oh, nice!

00:30:14.383 --> 00:30:15.814
ORION: So, if you want to just squirt -

00:30:15.814 --> 00:30:19.510
and I do a small, little squirt-blasts on Scanlan.

00:30:19.510 --> 00:30:21.235
SAM: Ahh!

00:30:22.725 --> 00:30:25.003
LAURA: Oh, okay. Lovely.

00:30:25.003 --> 00:30:26.471
LIAM: Is that unlimited?

00:30:26.471 --> 00:30:27.975
ORION: Well, of course it is!

00:30:27.975 --> 00:30:29.929
Why would I carry a non-magical item on me?

00:30:29.929 --> 00:30:31.505
That's ridiculous.

00:30:31.505 --> 00:30:33.264
ASHLEY: Just a water bottle.

00:30:33.264 --> 00:30:36.745
ORION: So yes, Scanlan, we're fine.

00:30:36.745 --> 00:30:38.541
SAM: That's good to know.

00:30:38.541 --> 00:30:40.007
LAURA: So, should we try to cross this little path here?

00:30:40.007 --> 00:30:41.388
ASHLEY: That sounds cool!

00:30:41.388 --> 00:30:42.424
SAM: That's really cool.

00:30:42.424 --> 00:30:43.963
LAURA: Can I use my tracking to see any of those duergar?

00:30:43.963 --> 00:30:46.983
To see if any of them have passed through the area;

00:30:46.983 --> 00:30:48.802
if there's a large group of them ahead of us?

00:30:48.802 --> 00:30:49.845
MATT: Sure.

00:30:49.845 --> 00:30:53.014
LAURA: I can use my tracking and my favored terrain

00:30:53.014 --> 00:30:55.040
to see how many within 6 miles,

00:30:55.040 --> 00:30:56.763
if there's a large group of them.

00:30:56.763 --> 00:30:58.160
MATT: Yes you can. All right.

00:30:58.160 --> 00:31:01.313
Go ahead and roll for your tracking check on that.

00:31:01.313 --> 00:31:02.287
LIAM: First roll.

00:31:02.287 --> 00:31:03.647
MATT: I believe it's survival.

00:31:03.647 --> 00:31:05.120
LAURA: Ooh! Here we go!

00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:06.764
TRAVIS: Do it for the Star Wars trailer.

00:31:06.764 --> 00:31:07.667
MARISHA: Roll. Roll. Roll.

00:31:07.667 --> 00:31:09.029
MATT: This is with advantage, I believe,

00:31:09.029 --> 00:31:10.267
because it's your favored terrain, correct?

00:31:10.267 --> 00:31:11.500
LAURA: Oh, okay.

00:31:11.500 --> 00:31:12.638
MARISHA: (singing) Your favored terrain!

00:31:12.638 --> 00:31:14.512
LAURA: Okay, that's better.

00:31:14.512 --> 00:31:15.648
Is that it?

00:31:15.648 --> 00:31:16.460
LIAM: Survival.

00:31:16.460 --> 00:31:17.350
LAURA: 21?

00:31:17.350 --> 00:31:19.926
MATT: 21! All right.

00:31:19.926 --> 00:31:22.222
You take a moment,

00:31:22.222 --> 00:31:25.338
and about 30 to 40 feet, you go through

00:31:25.338 --> 00:31:26.732
and inspect the way the terrain's been pushed

00:31:26.732 --> 00:31:27.682
and the dirt has been shoved aside.

00:31:27.682 --> 00:31:30.230
Tracking footprints and scuff marks on the rock

00:31:30.230 --> 00:31:32.491
and the walls nearby, seeing if any of the flows

00:31:32.491 --> 00:31:35.111
have been interrupted recently, and you ascertain

00:31:35.111 --> 00:31:38.557
that there is actually a pretty continuous patrol through here.

00:31:38.557 --> 00:31:41.766
About once every 4 to 8 hours up and down this tunnel

00:31:41.766 --> 00:31:45.271
that contain anywhere from 5 to 10 or more duergar,

00:31:45.271 --> 00:31:46.959
sometimes other, larger creatures.

00:31:46.959 --> 00:31:49.114
You find footprints that resemble maybe the ogres

00:31:49.114 --> 00:31:52.245
you mentioned earlier, possible troll footprints,

00:31:52.245 --> 00:31:55.182
but you're not familiar with that entity.

00:31:55.182 --> 00:31:59.322
You also notice some of the walls have what looks like

00:31:59.322 --> 00:32:01.483
small, localized cave-ins, almost as if something

00:32:01.483 --> 00:32:03.550
had burrowed through at one time or another.

00:32:03.550 --> 00:32:05.499
TRAVIS: Awesome. Great.

00:32:05.499 --> 00:32:07.005
MATT: Large, large creatures. So, there's also things

00:32:07.005 --> 00:32:09.584
that exist outside of the tunnel system.

00:32:09.584 --> 00:32:10.739
ASHLEY: Like Tremors?

00:32:10.739 --> 00:32:12.202
LAURA: So, as quickly as possible, we should get 
through these tunnels, I assume?

00:32:12.202 --> 00:32:13.360
MATT: Probably a good idea.

00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:14.388
As a note though, you said within 6 miles?

00:32:14.388 --> 00:32:15.373
LAURA: Yes.

00:32:15.373 --> 00:32:16.798
SAM: 6 miles?!

00:32:16.798 --> 00:32:19.477
MATT: As you continue tracking down this tunnel -

00:32:19.477 --> 00:32:23.099
and it takes you a good 3 or 4 hours to finally reach a point

00:32:23.099 --> 00:32:25.779
where the tunnel begins to widen up -

00:32:25.779 --> 00:32:30.997
you assess that, maybe 3 miles up,

00:32:30.997 --> 00:32:33.960
there is a localized town.

00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:38.865
Or, at least, a population of duergar amassed 
in a central place.

00:32:38.865 --> 00:32:41.252
LIAM: Check out the brain on Brad!

00:32:41.252 --> 00:32:43.045
LAURA: So 3 to 4 miles up, you said,

00:32:43.045 --> 00:32:44.338
from where we are at this point?

00:32:44.338 --> 00:32:47.243
MATT: Yeah. From where you began.

00:32:47.243 --> 00:32:48.603
TRAVIS: Should we be stealthing?

00:32:48.603 --> 00:32:49.795
LAURA: We should probably start stealthing 
at this point, yes.

00:32:49.795 --> 00:32:50.995
LIAM: Yes. I was about to say I'd like to move

00:32:50.995 --> 00:32:53.622
ahead of the group a bit and start sneaking along.

00:32:53.622 --> 00:32:54.747
MATT: Let's do that! Go ahead and roll stealth.

00:32:54.747 --> 00:32:57.262
LIAM: Do I have advantage like my sister had for--

00:32:57.262 --> 00:32:58.811
MATT: You do not.

00:32:58.811 --> 00:33:00.083
LIAM: No. All right, well--

00:33:00.083 --> 00:33:01.013
LAURA: Should we all try to stealth?

00:33:01.013 --> 00:33:02.056
LIAM: 26 for me.

00:33:02.056 --> 00:33:03.663
MATT: This would be a group stealth check.

00:33:03.663 --> 00:33:05.608
LIAM: 26. I've tiptoed away.

00:33:09.746 --> 00:33:10.456
SAM: 19.

00:33:10.456 --> 00:33:12.039
MARISHA: 15.

00:33:12.039 --> 00:33:13.217
TALIESIN: 7.

00:33:13.217 --> 00:33:14.109
TRAVIS: 17.

00:33:14.109 --> 00:33:15.156
ASHLEY: 7.

00:33:15.156 --> 00:33:16.215
LAURA: 20.

00:33:16.215 --> 00:33:16.866
LIAM: 26.

00:33:16.866 --> 00:33:17.809
MATT: All right.

00:33:17.809 --> 00:33:18.980
ASHLEY: (laughs)

00:33:18.980 --> 00:33:21.552
MATT: Picking up on the shortcomings of a handful of members

00:33:21.552 --> 00:33:24.479
of your group, you do manage to maintain what you feel is

00:33:24.479 --> 00:33:30.102
a fairly stealthy advance deeper into this tunnel system.

00:33:30.102 --> 00:33:32.772
About an hour and a half of perpetual travel,

00:33:32.772 --> 00:33:35.414
as the tunnel slowly widens further and further,

00:33:35.414 --> 00:33:39.349
with every quarter mile or so, you eventually

00:33:39.349 --> 00:33:42.115
get to a point where the tunnel shoots open

00:33:42.115 --> 00:33:45.542
into a gargantuan cavern.

00:33:45.542 --> 00:33:48.964
A chamber nearly a mile and a half across

00:33:48.964 --> 00:33:50.264
from this visual point.

00:33:50.264 --> 00:33:51.580
ASHLEY: (quietly)...of secrets?

00:33:51.580 --> 00:33:55.349
MATT: It is extremely tall, with hundreds of very jagged

00:33:55.349 --> 00:33:57.737
stalagmites hanging from the ceiling,

00:33:57.737 --> 00:34:01.796
and rock formations that rise and fall at different points

00:34:01.796 --> 00:34:04.032
of the topography. This entire tunnel is built

00:34:04.032 --> 00:34:05.817
in this strange, large, natural,

00:34:05.817 --> 00:34:07.794
downward curve that disappears out of sight

00:34:07.794 --> 00:34:10.463
about a mile ahead and to the left.

00:34:10.463 --> 00:34:13.828
But this huge tunnel is lit with what looks like maybe

00:34:13.828 --> 00:34:19.594
2 to 3 dozen various small lava falls that are pouring

00:34:19.594 --> 00:34:25.009
down the sides of this giant cavern's structure.

00:34:25.009 --> 00:34:28.363
You also see some small pockets of that red glow stone

00:34:28.363 --> 00:34:33.568
that a lot of these Dwarven tunnels tend to use 
as a light source.

00:34:33.568 --> 00:34:38.237
You also, as you begin to step into this, carefully -

00:34:38.237 --> 00:34:42.427
you, taking point on this, both the twins; you notice -

00:34:42.427 --> 00:34:45.531
on the far end of this cavern…

00:34:50.098 --> 00:34:52.809
Well, first off, the entire landscape is rough and craggy,

00:34:52.809 --> 00:34:55.079
with large, black, obsidian spikes

00:34:55.079 --> 00:34:56.780
just jutting out of the ground at various points.

00:34:56.780 --> 00:34:58.829
Whether it be seismically created or otherwise,

00:34:58.829 --> 00:35:01.370
it's a very unwelcoming atmosphere.

00:35:01.370 --> 00:35:03.334
And that sulfurous smell is extremely strong.

00:35:03.334 --> 00:35:05.032
Even though you’ve gotten used to it as far as you can

00:35:05.032 --> 00:35:07.311
for this travel, it’s still a very pungent odor

00:35:07.311 --> 00:35:09.037
and you find that it’s going to be very difficult for you

00:35:09.037 --> 00:35:12.556
to make out any other scent in this location right now

00:35:12.556 --> 00:35:14.450
other than that horrible mixture of chemicals that probably

00:35:14.450 --> 00:35:17.118
isn’t very healthy to be breathing at the moment.

00:35:19.446 --> 00:35:21.882
What you see across the chamber, your eyes focus

00:35:21.882 --> 00:35:25.558
on a small cluster of buildings, it looks, of a similar construct

00:35:25.558 --> 00:35:28.648
as the barracks that you saw at the war camp.

00:35:30.117 --> 00:35:32.274
You can probably surmise somewhere in the neighborhood

00:35:32.274 --> 00:35:33.893
of about 20 to 25 of these structures,

00:35:33.893 --> 00:35:36.992
all localized in this one area

00:35:36.992 --> 00:35:38.903
that is punctuated with -

00:35:38.903 --> 00:35:42.439
you can count about 7 of these black obsidian spires

00:35:42.439 --> 00:35:45.701
that rise out at different points around like watchtowers.

00:35:45.701 --> 00:35:46.780
LIAM: Still natural?

00:35:46.780 --> 00:35:48.171
MATT: No, these are constructed.

00:35:48.171 --> 00:35:50.855
These are very smooth and have that

00:35:50.855 --> 00:35:52.467
rigid Dwarvish construction

00:35:52.467 --> 00:35:58.767
with a jagged edge to each one of the leveled lips 
of these towers.

00:35:58.767 --> 00:36:02.066
The one that you can see closest to you, 
which is about a quarter mile off,

00:36:02.066 --> 00:36:04.076
you can just barely make out what looks like a couple of duergar

00:36:04.076 --> 00:36:06.282
walking across one of the upper levels

00:36:06.282 --> 00:36:08.991
and what looks like some sort of ballista and/or

00:36:08.991 --> 00:36:11.495
anti-personnel weapon that is put--

00:36:11.495 --> 00:36:12.797
LAURA: This is where Kima’s being held.

00:36:12.797 --> 00:36:14.720
SAM: How do you know that?

00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:16.010
LAURA: She had a vision.

00:36:16.010 --> 00:36:17.644
ORION: Plus, it’s a really big thing.

00:36:17.644 --> 00:36:18.857
SAM: That’s true.

00:36:18.857 --> 00:36:21.512
MATT: These giant bolt-throwers currently reside on 
each one of these,

00:36:21.512 --> 00:36:25.602
and then in the center of this cluster of buildings,

00:36:25.602 --> 00:36:30.040
you see standing a gargantuan ebony fortress.

00:36:30.040 --> 00:36:32.329
Serrated stonework marks the top of each wall

00:36:32.329 --> 00:36:34.296
and more of these giant bolt-throwers

00:36:34.296 --> 00:36:36.100
are mounted across the parapets.

00:36:36.100 --> 00:36:39.397
A massive magma fall descends from the rocky ceiling,

00:36:39.397 --> 00:36:42.108
right above the stronghold, onto the roof

00:36:42.108 --> 00:36:46.579
and is forked onto each side and then continues to flow down,

00:36:46.579 --> 00:36:50.145
buttressing each side of the stronghold almost as 
a defense mechanism,

00:36:50.145 --> 00:36:52.781
like they built it intentionally underneath this magma fall.

00:36:52.781 --> 00:36:53.634
SAM: Wow.

00:36:53.634 --> 00:36:55.446
LAURA: Oh, that’s where the trapdoor is!

00:36:55.446 --> 00:36:56.712
SAM: What? Trapdoor?

00:36:56.712 --> 00:36:57.875
TRAVIS: There’s a trapdoor.

00:36:57.875 --> 00:36:58.736
LAURA: Yeah.

00:36:58.736 --> 00:36:59.570
MARISHA: Wait...under the magma?

00:36:59.570 --> 00:37:01.370
LAURA: You missed a lot, Scanlan.
MARISHA: Oh, right.

00:37:01.370 --> 00:37:03.181
SAM: I was with you the whole time.

00:37:03.181 --> 00:37:04.531
ORION: Yes, but you were never paying attention.

00:37:04.531 --> 00:37:06.137
SAM: I was drunk.

00:37:06.137 --> 00:37:07.538
ORION: You got that new magazine and you’ve

00:37:07.538 --> 00:37:09.694
been staring at it a long time.

00:37:09.694 --> 00:37:11.163
SAM: Well, it’s hot gnomes.

00:37:11.163 --> 00:37:15.684
LIAM: Vax creeps back to Pike and ushers her up to the front.

00:37:15.684 --> 00:37:20.739
Do you recall any of the details from your vision, 
from your dreams?

00:37:20.739 --> 00:37:23.718
ASHLEY: I’ve definitely been here in my vision.

00:37:23.718 --> 00:37:25.936
(all laugh)

00:37:25.936 --> 00:37:28.286
ASHLEY: I do remember that much.

00:37:28.286 --> 00:37:31.704
All of this looks familiar,

00:37:31.704 --> 00:37:34.186
and I think we’re in the right place.

00:37:34.186 --> 00:37:35.439
LAURA: Sweet.

00:37:35.439 --> 00:37:38.621
ORION: Very good. That’s all important.

00:37:38.621 --> 00:37:41.480
ASHLEY: Do we know what else is around?

00:37:41.480 --> 00:37:43.391
What was the building again? With the--

00:37:43.391 --> 00:37:44.450
SAM: It’s a fortress.

00:37:44.450 --> 00:37:46.734
MATT: The giant building you see is called Emberhold.

00:37:46.734 --> 00:37:48.314
That’s what it’s been referred to as.

00:37:48.314 --> 00:37:49.709
SAM: And it’s not a temple?

00:37:49.709 --> 00:37:50.909
MATT: It’s not a temple, it is a fortress.

00:37:50.909 --> 00:37:53.373
The temple of where apparently K'Varn

00:37:53.373 --> 00:37:54.958
as far as you know exists

00:37:54.958 --> 00:37:59.985
is further below in the fungal forest that

00:37:59.985 --> 00:38:01.666
surrounds this ancient city ruin

00:38:01.666 --> 00:38:04.867
that has been repurposed by the illithids

00:38:04.867 --> 00:38:06.997
that Clarota actually came from.

00:38:06.997 --> 00:38:11.973
LAURA: Oh, yes! And we know here, because the general

00:38:11.973 --> 00:38:15.668
that we mind melded - Clarota read his brain.

00:38:15.668 --> 00:38:17.097
SAM: Yeah, I was there!

00:38:17.097 --> 00:38:18.888
LAURA: I know. It’s just you were drunk, so I’m reiterating it.

00:38:18.888 --> 00:38:20.153
(all laugh)

00:38:20.153 --> 00:38:21.477
SAM: Yeah yeah, good, thank you for that.

00:38:21.477 --> 00:38:23.391
ORION: Just making sure.

00:38:23.391 --> 00:38:25.262
TALIESIN: You had this very vivid look the whole time.

00:38:25.262 --> 00:38:26.730
LAURA: So remember, Scanlan, that the general said

00:38:26.730 --> 00:38:28.061
that on the left side of the fortress--

00:38:28.061 --> 00:38:29.203
SAM: Of the fortress.

00:38:29.203 --> 00:38:30.408
LAURA: --is how we can get into the trapdoor.

00:38:30.408 --> 00:38:32.294
SAM: How we can get into the trapdoor, exactly.

00:38:32.294 --> 00:38:33.341
LIAM: By the smaller--

00:38:33.341 --> 00:38:35.077
SAM: Smaller--

00:38:35.077 --> 00:38:36.724
LIAM: --of two lava flows.
LAURA: By the smaller of two lava flows.

00:38:36.724 --> 00:38:37.626
SAM: --of two...what?

00:38:37.626 --> 00:38:39.161
LAURA: Lava flows.

00:38:39.161 --> 00:38:40.329
ASHLEY: So what we’re looking at is the fortress?

00:38:40.329 --> 00:38:41.359
LAURA: Yes.

00:38:41.359 --> 00:38:42.560
MATT: You’re looking at Emberhold itself,

00:38:42.560 --> 00:38:44.845
the center of the duergar society and from what you’ve gleaned

00:38:44.845 --> 00:38:47.286
from two different duergar that you’ve interrogated,

00:38:47.286 --> 00:38:50.018
supposedly where Lady Kima has been held should she still--

00:38:50.018 --> 00:38:51.491
LAURA: by King Murghol?

00:38:51.491 --> 00:38:53.382
MATT: --By King Murghol.

00:38:53.382 --> 00:38:58.585
Murghol and Queen Ulara.

00:39:00.619 --> 00:39:06.865
LIAM: From our vantage point can we see the two lava flows

00:39:06.865 --> 00:39:09.522
that we were warned about?

00:39:09.522 --> 00:39:10.959
MATT: It is way too far away.

00:39:10.959 --> 00:39:12.810
That stronghold is probably a good mile and a half away 
from you right now.

00:39:12.810 --> 00:39:15.581
LAURA: So, there is a lot of cover as we go near it

00:39:15.581 --> 00:39:16.833
because of all the…?

00:39:16.833 --> 00:39:18.751
MATT: There is a lot of cover, yes, but it’s a lot 
of open area with cover,

00:39:18.751 --> 00:39:21.016
so it’s one of those you’re just going to have to be careful 
as you move through.

00:39:21.016 --> 00:39:21.883
SAM: Percy.

00:39:21.883 --> 00:39:23.374
LAURA: It’s pretty dark here, right?

00:39:23.374 --> 00:39:24.710
TALIESIN: Yes?

00:39:24.710 --> 00:39:26.199
SAM: How long would it take you to make a nuclear weapon?

00:39:26.199 --> 00:39:27.866
MATT: Yes, it’s pretty dark here, the only reason 
you can see much is because of the low light vision.

00:39:27.866 --> 00:39:29.480
TALIESIN: A very long time. If I start it right now..

00:39:29.480 --> 00:39:30.977
MATT: Even at this radius, things you could see nearby,

00:39:30.977 --> 00:39:32.605
a light source would be very helpful in making sure

00:39:32.605 --> 00:39:34.785
that you can see details and not fall in anything you 
don’t want to,

00:39:34.785 --> 00:39:37.841
but it also makes you very visible to anything else out there,

00:39:37.841 --> 00:39:38.980
so you have to decide.

00:39:38.980 --> 00:39:43.223
LIAM: Between the lava and the red stones, the twins can see, 
correct?

00:39:43.223 --> 00:39:44.449
Because of the dim light.

00:39:44.449 --> 00:39:46.336
MATT: You can see near, but these are things 
that are a mile away.

00:39:46.336 --> 00:39:47.332
LAURA: But nothing at a distance.

00:39:47.332 --> 00:39:48.008
LIAM: Right, right, right.

00:39:48.008 --> 00:39:49.325
MATT: It’s way too far away.

00:39:49.325 --> 00:39:52.811
The reason you can make out this small city and Emberhold itself

00:39:52.811 --> 00:39:55.657
is because there are clusters of the red glowstone

00:39:55.657 --> 00:39:58.434
used within that city and the giant magma fall

00:39:58.434 --> 00:40:01.245
that currently envelops the sides of the stronghold,

00:40:01.245 --> 00:40:03.921
making it very, very visible and easy to pick out

00:40:03.921 --> 00:40:06.047
against the rest of the cavern.

00:40:06.047 --> 00:40:07.327
ASHLEY: So this is a whole little city down here.

00:40:07.327 --> 00:40:08.192
LIAM: Yes.

00:40:08.192 --> 00:40:09.169
MATT: About a mile off, yeah.

00:40:09.169 --> 00:40:10.537
LAURA: So we should keep to the left and head

00:40:10.537 --> 00:40:11.580
down that direction and try to--

00:40:11.580 --> 00:40:13.141
MARISHA: I'm actually gonna go ahead and cast

00:40:13.141 --> 00:40:15.007
Pass Without A Trace.

00:40:15.007 --> 00:40:16.260
MATT: Okay.

00:40:16.260 --> 00:40:17.673
SAM: (whispering) What does that do?

00:40:17.673 --> 00:40:19.573
MARISHA: (whispering) It makes us really stealthy.

00:40:19.573 --> 00:40:20.920
SAM: Oh, cool!

00:40:20.920 --> 00:40:23.000
ORION: It's the thing that saved our butts last time.

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:24.029
LIAM: It quiets your parts.

00:40:24.029 --> 00:40:25.086
MATT: You've seen this before.

00:40:25.086 --> 00:40:27.143
As she finishes her incantation, you feel the darkness

00:40:27.143 --> 00:40:29.136
of the shadows around you begin to coalesce

00:40:29.136 --> 00:40:30.822
and almost stick to you.

00:40:30.822 --> 00:40:32.382
Although there's no substance, for a moment you almost

00:40:32.382 --> 00:40:34.100
find yourself repulsed by it, until you realize

00:40:34.100 --> 00:40:36.825
that it's probably an advantageous circumstance.

00:40:36.825 --> 00:40:40.032
But you find yourself now much easier to slip 
into the surrounding shadows.

00:40:40.032 --> 00:40:41.325
MARISHA: They're nice shadows.

00:40:41.325 --> 00:40:42.704
TRAVIS: And I'm doing my flower girl routine

00:40:42.704 --> 00:40:44.617
with the dust of tracelessness.

00:40:44.617 --> 00:40:48.961
Just over here, over there, put a little on Pike.

00:40:48.961 --> 00:40:51.970
TALIESIN: We don't really need - Well...

00:40:51.970 --> 00:40:54.506
TRAVIS: What? We've got a really large amount.

00:40:54.506 --> 00:40:55.812
ORION: You never know, Percy, he does it all the time.

00:40:55.812 --> 00:40:56.824
We don't know how many times it's saved us.

00:40:56.824 --> 00:40:58.037
MARISHA: (laughing) We've got a really large amount.

00:40:58.037 --> 00:40:59.202
TALIESIN: I suppose that's fair.

00:40:59.202 --> 00:41:00.891
SAM: What's our angle here, gents?

00:41:00.891 --> 00:41:02.603
LIAM: We need to get closer up.

00:41:02.603 --> 00:41:05.545
We need to find this trap door, because it's suicide 
going in the front.

00:41:05.545 --> 00:41:07.447
LAURA: Right. And Lady Kima's being held here.

00:41:07.447 --> 00:41:09.160
SAM: So there's an entrance to this trap door that

00:41:09.160 --> 00:41:11.582
possibly is on the outskirts of the city?

00:41:11.582 --> 00:41:12.354
LIAM &amp;amp; LAURA: Yes.

00:41:12.354 --> 00:41:13.560
SAM: So we need to find it.

00:41:13.560 --> 00:41:14.827
LAURA: Yes, it's on the left.

00:41:14.827 --> 00:41:16.080
SAM: Oh, it's on the left?

00:41:16.080 --> 00:41:17.465
LAURA: Yes, so we're heading left and going--

00:41:17.465 --> 00:41:18.601
SAM: Let's do it!

00:41:18.601 --> 00:41:21.295
LIAM: The twins will creep - continue ahead.

00:41:21.295 --> 00:41:23.513
ASHLEY: Yeah, you guys real stealthy, so--

00:41:23.513 --> 00:41:25.057
TRAVIS: Yeah, keep creeping, keep creeping.

00:41:25.057 --> 00:41:26.249
ASHLEY: --Probably smart that you're moving ahead.

00:41:26.249 --> 00:41:27.829
MATT: Okay.

00:41:27.829 --> 00:41:30.036
ORION: I'll take point on the group that's following.

00:41:30.036 --> 00:41:31.031
MATT: All right.

00:41:31.031 --> 00:41:32.919
LAURA: You guys take care of Trinket as I'm ahead of you.

00:41:32.919 --> 00:41:34.342
ASHLEY: Come on, Trinket.

00:41:34.342 --> 00:41:35.948
TRAVIS: (growling sounds) Me and Trinket are telling jokes

00:41:35.948 --> 00:41:37.319
in the back of the group.

00:41:37.319 --> 00:41:38.785
SAM: Quietly.

00:41:38.785 --> 00:41:40.861
MARISHA: Classic Trinket.

00:41:40.861 --> 00:41:45.065
MATT: All right. You guys continue staying off the main path

00:41:45.065 --> 00:41:47.661
and you can see there is about a 20-foot natural formation

00:41:47.661 --> 00:41:52.094
of a walkway or at least where most of the patrols

00:41:52.094 --> 00:41:56.430
and any sort of duergar foot travel is localized.

00:41:56.430 --> 00:41:58.881
You can see where that natural road has been created 
over time.

00:41:58.881 --> 00:42:01.005
You avoid that path and steer off to the left,

00:42:01.005 --> 00:42:03.331
dodging between the various bits of terrain.

00:42:03.331 --> 00:42:07.525
And it's a very rocky and difficult terrain

00:42:07.525 --> 00:42:09.662
should you not be with your ranger,

00:42:09.662 --> 00:42:11.751
who has the Underdark as her favored terrain.

00:42:11.751 --> 00:42:13.455
LAURA: Oh, I'll go back, then. Should I?

00:42:13.455 --> 00:42:14.975
Or is it okay because we're all together?

00:42:14.975 --> 00:42:16.863
MATT: It's okay because you guys are in theory together.

00:42:16.863 --> 00:42:18.393
I'm going to say essentially you're just marking places

00:42:18.393 --> 00:42:20.636
where the terrain would be dangerous, to watch your step

00:42:20.636 --> 00:42:24.479
and to be wary of any locations that might be unsafe

00:42:24.479 --> 00:42:26.742
for load bearing, anything like that.

00:42:26.742 --> 00:42:29.503
TRAVIS: Yeah, I saw that look.

00:42:29.503 --> 00:42:31.766
You calling me load bearing?

00:42:31.766 --> 00:42:32.825
(all laugh)

00:42:32.825 --> 00:42:34.133
MATT: Yes!

00:42:34.133 --> 00:42:37.414
TRAVIS: That's honest.

00:42:37.414 --> 00:42:44.764
MATT: Specific. As you guys begin to curve around the left,

00:42:44.764 --> 00:42:46.697
everyone roll a perception check real fast.

00:42:46.697 --> 00:42:48.506
SAM: Oh, snap.

00:42:48.506 --> 00:42:52.007
TRAVIS: Prepare for a natural... lap.

00:42:54.039 --> 00:42:55.725
ORION: With our proficiency bonus?

00:42:55.725 --> 00:42:58.245
MATT: Only if you're proficient with perception.

00:42:58.245 --> 00:43:00.490
SAM: I can't read the dice.

00:43:00.490 --> 00:43:02.043
It's either a 6 or a 9. No idea.

00:43:02.043 --> 00:43:02.809
ORION: 15.

00:43:02.809 --> 00:43:03.851
MATT: Is there a dot on the bottom?

00:43:03.851 --> 00:43:04.688
SAM: Oh, that's the bottom?

00:43:04.688 --> 00:43:05.558
MATT: Yeah.

00:43:05.558 --> 00:43:07.033
SAM: It's a 6!

00:43:07.033 --> 00:43:09.104
(all laugh)

00:43:09.104 --> 00:43:10.710
ASHLEY: Oh, Scanlan!

00:43:10.710 --> 00:43:11.607
MARISHA: 16.

00:43:11.607 --> 00:43:12.449
ORION: 15.

00:43:12.467 --> 00:43:13.146
TALIESIN: 24.

00:43:13.146 --> 00:43:13.861
TRAVIS: 9.

00:43:13.861 --> 00:43:14.588
ASHLEY: 19.

00:43:14.588 --> 00:43:15.298
LAURA: 20.

00:43:15.298 --> 00:43:16.144
LIAM: 25.

00:43:16.144 --> 00:43:21.505
MATT: All right. Both Percy and Vax simultaneously

00:43:21.505 --> 00:43:24.380
put their arms out to hold everyone back as you instinctively--

00:43:24.380 --> 00:43:27.242
LIAM: Dtdtdt!

00:43:27.242 --> 00:43:32.050
MATT: --You hear a slight distant clanking of metal and voices.

00:43:32.050 --> 00:43:34.403
Low, kind of conversational voices.

00:43:34.403 --> 00:43:36.344
Too far for you to listen at this point.

00:43:36.344 --> 00:43:38.275
But you guys immediately stop everyone.

00:43:38.275 --> 00:43:41.871
And you can just see, over maybe a good 70, 80 feet

00:43:41.871 --> 00:43:45.303
from your distance, heading up the path you guys 
had just began to skirt around,

00:43:45.303 --> 00:43:48.312
a small, what looks like a roving patrol of duergar.

00:43:48.312 --> 00:43:49.885
Probably the ones that go up and down the tunnel.

00:43:49.885 --> 00:43:51.948
LAURA: I can ambush them!

00:43:51.948 --> 00:43:52.963
SAM: Ambush them?

00:43:52.963 --> 00:43:53.861
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah!

00:43:53.861 --> 00:43:55.021
TALIESIN: (whispering) Let them pass.

00:43:55.021 --> 00:43:56.322
SAM: Why don't we create a distraction and get rid of them?

00:43:56.322 --> 00:43:58.102
LAURA: Well, okay, but I can - (whispering) I can be really quiet.

00:43:58.102 --> 00:44:00.514
I can do Hide In Plain Sight now.

00:44:00.514 --> 00:44:02.251
So, I could completely hide myself standing there.

00:44:02.251 --> 00:44:03.823
SAM: How many are there? Are you gonna kill--

00:44:03.823 --> 00:44:05.163
MATT: No one's seen them, you can just hear them.

00:44:05.163 --> 00:44:06.255
No one's gone to check.

00:44:06.255 --> 00:44:07.335
LAURA: Oh! Can I look?

00:44:07.335 --> 00:44:08.332
LIAM: Yes, let's go look.

00:44:08.332 --> 00:44:09.151
MATT: You can.

00:44:09.151 --> 00:44:09.982
LAURA: Okay, let's look.

00:44:09.982 --> 00:44:10.924
LIAM: Let's go catch one.

00:44:10.924 --> 00:44:12.094
MARISHA: (quietly) Can we not just hide?

00:44:12.094 --> 00:44:13.874
MATT: Just the two of you?

00:44:13.874 --> 00:44:16.616
ORION: How far away are we from them?

00:44:16.616 --> 00:44:17.934
Like, in distance?

00:44:17.934 --> 00:44:21.930
MATT: Right now? You're guessing about 80 to 70 feet, 
but closing fast.

00:44:21.930 --> 00:44:25.546
Not closing directly on you, because they're doing 
a slightly different path.

00:44:25.546 --> 00:44:26.567
LAURA: (whispering) Everybody stay quiet.

00:44:26.567 --> 00:44:27.841
TALIESIN: They're taking the path that we're not on, right?

00:44:27.841 --> 00:44:28.789
MATT: Correct.

00:44:28.789 --> 00:44:30.232
TALIESIN: So, if we hide--

00:44:30.232 --> 00:44:31.299
LAURA: They won't find us.

00:44:31.299 --> 00:44:32.237
TALIESIN: --They won't find us.

00:44:32.237 --> 00:44:33.140
LAURA: Potentially.

00:44:33.140 --> 00:44:34.605
ORION: And they can just pass.

00:44:34.605 --> 00:44:35.865
LAURA: But I want to hear what they're saying.

00:44:35.865 --> 00:44:37.969
MATT: Okay, so all of you guys, who's--

00:44:37.969 --> 00:44:41.596
MARISHA: We'll all hide. I go ahead and cast

00:44:41.596 --> 00:44:44.198
Guidance on Vax.

00:44:44.198 --> 00:44:45.491
LAURA: What does that mean?

00:44:45.491 --> 00:44:46.207
LIAM: Vex.

00:44:46.207 --> 00:44:47.218
MATT: Is that a concentration spell?

00:44:47.218 --> 00:44:48.327
LAURA: I'm Vex, he's Vax.

00:44:48.327 --> 00:44:49.252
We look alike, it's understandable.

00:44:49.252 --> 00:44:51.532
MATT: Just checking if it’s concentration or not,

00:44:51.532 --> 00:44:54.669
because that will definitely break your other spell.

00:44:54.669 --> 00:44:55.992
I'll pull it up here real fast.

00:44:55.992 --> 00:44:57.014
LAURA: Oh, no, then don't. Keep Pass Without A Trace.

00:44:57.014 --> 00:44:58.601
TRAVIS: Well, we could just get this party started right here,
if we want to.

00:44:58.601 --> 00:44:59.701
MARISHA: Let me see, it might just be--

00:44:59.701 --> 00:45:01.107
MATT: Guidance is concentration.

00:45:01.107 --> 00:45:02.545
MARISHA: No, sorry, you don't have my guidance.

00:45:02.545 --> 00:45:04.091
LAURA: That's okay, that’s okay.

00:45:04.091 --> 00:45:05.664
MARISHA: No guidance here.

00:45:05.664 --> 00:45:06.938
LIAM: Why don't we go just up ahead and scout?

00:45:06.938 --> 00:45:08.919
LAURA: Just a little bit ahead and see what we can see.

00:45:08.919 --> 00:45:12.028
MATT: Okay. So, the two of you kind of work up.

00:45:18.107 --> 00:45:20.305
As the rest of you are holding back,

00:45:20.305 --> 00:45:22.863
the twins slink between the various rock formations

00:45:22.863 --> 00:45:25.739
and strange, jagged spires that are currently

00:45:25.739 --> 00:45:27.950
peppering this entire underground landscape.

00:45:27.950 --> 00:45:29.824
You get up to a point where you're maybe 10 feet

00:45:29.824 --> 00:45:33.400
from the road and with your backs against the rock,

00:45:33.400 --> 00:45:38.182
you can begin to see the roving band slowly move around.

00:45:38.182 --> 00:45:39.734
SAM: (whispering) Band?

00:45:39.734 --> 00:45:42.824
MATT: The band of duergar.

00:45:42.824 --> 00:45:45.960
You count, at quick glance, roughly 12 to 15.

00:45:45.960 --> 00:45:47.459
MARISHA: Oh, yeah...

00:45:47.459 --> 00:45:50.278
MATT: Armed with hammers, halberds, um...

00:45:51.990 --> 00:45:55.219
Both of you guys roll a perception check right now.

00:45:55.988 --> 00:45:57.478
LIAM: Perception check.

00:45:57.478 --> 00:45:59.032
MATT: Perception check. Specific for this one.

00:46:01.243 --> 00:46:02.494
LIAM: 26.

00:46:02.494 --> 00:46:03.563
LAURA: 17.

00:46:03.563 --> 00:46:06.388
MATT: You make out that one of them holds no weapons.

00:46:06.388 --> 00:46:07.938
Instead is dressed in--

00:46:07.938 --> 00:46:09.540
LAURA: Wait, no! I get advantage on perception,

00:46:09.540 --> 00:46:10.761
because I'm in my favored terrain.

00:46:10.761 --> 00:46:11.779
MATT: There you go.

00:46:11.779 --> 00:46:12.872
LIAM: I already perceived it.

00:46:12.872 --> 00:46:14.251
LAURA: Oh, yeah, never mind, okay.

00:46:14.251 --> 00:46:15.399
(all laugh)

00:46:15.399 --> 00:46:17.189
MATT: You can also perceive, I suppose.

00:46:17.189 --> 00:46:18.708
ORION: (whispering) I already perceived it.

00:46:18.708 --> 00:46:21.158
MATT: One of the duergar walking alongside is

00:46:21.158 --> 00:46:24.537
completely bald on top with this extremely long,

00:46:24.537 --> 00:46:29.900
well sculpted, black goatee beard that streams down.

00:46:29.900 --> 00:46:32.313
Thick black and red trimmed robes.

00:46:32.313 --> 00:46:37.903
Carries no weapons and looks extremely dangerous.

00:46:37.903 --> 00:46:40.092
However, as you're listening to the conversation,

00:46:40.092 --> 00:46:42.933
you specifically, being able to understand 
Undercommon--

00:46:42.933 --> 00:46:44.478
LAURA: Yes.

00:46:44.478 --> 00:46:46.970
LIAM: What is he saying?

00:46:46.970 --> 00:46:48.394
LAURA: Hold on.

00:46:48.394 --> 00:46:50.157
MATT: --You pick up bits and pieces as they begin to pass by.

00:46:50.157 --> 00:46:52.225
You hold your breath, hoping nobody notices you,

00:46:52.225 --> 00:46:53.507
and so far so good.

00:46:53.507 --> 00:46:57.570
They begin to walk slowly past the rock you guys are against.

00:46:57.570 --> 00:47:00.460
You overhear one of them say:

00:47:00.460 --> 00:47:04.673
“Well, keep your eyes peeled, eh. That thing is still out there.”

00:47:04.673 --> 00:47:06.464
And the other one slaps him and says:

00:47:06.464 --> 00:47:09.509
“Horek says that it ate a whole scouting party in seconds.”

00:47:09.509 --> 00:47:10.928
Another one goes:

00:47:10.928 --> 00:47:13.085
“Listening to Horek was your first mistake.

00:47:13.085 --> 00:47:15.227
“Shut up and keep walking.”

00:47:15.227 --> 00:47:17.932
And they all keep pushing. At which point, the same

00:47:17.932 --> 00:47:20.673
scared one from before says:

00:47:20.673 --> 00:47:22.942
“I mean, if that one went crazy, well,

00:47:22.942 --> 00:47:25.131
“can't the other ones crack, too?

00:47:25.131 --> 00:47:31.029
“I don't know if I feel safe around any of K'varn's pets 
anymore at this rate.”

00:47:31.029 --> 00:47:33.729
And by that point, they begin to slowly move past

00:47:33.729 --> 00:47:35.159
and their voices begin to fade,

00:47:35.159 --> 00:47:37.107
as they continue up the path you guys just traversed down.

00:47:37.107 --> 00:47:38.626
LAURA: (gasps)

00:47:38.626 --> 00:47:39.930
MATT: Up to the lava tunnels.

00:47:39.930 --> 00:47:41.141
LAURA: Oh shit.

00:47:41.141 --> 00:47:42.909
TRAVIS: Good thing I was clearing our footprints.

00:47:42.909 --> 00:47:46.978
(all laugh)

00:47:46.978 --> 00:47:48.518
MATT: It's actually a very good thing.

00:47:48.518 --> 00:47:49.657
SAM: It's a win for Grog.

00:47:49.657 --> 00:47:50.470
TRAVIS: (high-pitched voice) Is it?

00:47:50.470 --> 00:47:51.438
Did I do something good?

00:47:51.438 --> 00:47:52.446
LIAM: Good job, dummy.

00:47:52.446 --> 00:47:53.464
MARISHA: (laughing) Did I do something good?

00:47:53.464 --> 00:47:54.377
MATT: You guys have, like,

00:47:54.377 --> 00:47:58.099
bear tracks and a giant goliath, like, what-- (laughs)

00:47:58.099 --> 00:48:00.913
ORION: These are amazing.

00:48:00.913 --> 00:48:02.129
MARISHA: What are they?

00:48:02.129 --> 00:48:03.375
LAURA: Fried banana.

00:48:03.375 --> 00:48:05.137
MARISHA: Oh! That's fun.

00:48:05.137 --> 00:48:06.567
MATT: Fried bananas? Toss me one of those.

00:48:06.567 --> 00:48:07.730
Is that from the chat?

00:48:07.730 --> 00:48:08.837
SAM: You're working. You don't have time to eat.

00:48:08.837 --> 00:48:10.165
ZAC: (off screen) Yes, the chat room.

00:48:10.165 --> 00:48:11.367
MATT &amp;amp; LAURA: Thank you, chatroom.

00:48:11.367 --> 00:48:12.538
MARISHA: Thank you.
ORION: Thanks so much.

00:48:12.538 --> 00:48:13.903
MATT: I know it's not a piece of pizza, guys,

00:48:13.903 --> 00:48:15.247
but I'll do what I can.

00:48:15.247 --> 00:48:16.041
(all laugh)

00:48:16.041 --> 00:48:17.358
SAM: Next time, sushi. Sushi.

00:48:17.358 --> 00:48:22.629
ZAC: (off screen) Instajur and somebody who didn't 
put their name on it.

00:48:22.629 --> 00:48:23.573
MATT: (disappointed) Oh.

00:48:23.573 --> 00:48:25.451
ORION: Instajur and mystery guy, thanks!

00:48:25.451 --> 00:48:26.954
ZAC: Coleson sent the pizza.

00:48:26.954 --> 00:48:29.760
ALL: Thank you!

00:48:29.760 --> 00:48:31.518
ASHLEY: Oh my god, that's so good.

00:48:31.518 --> 00:48:33.167
MATT: The sound of the duergar walking eventually fades

00:48:33.167 --> 00:48:34.668
and you feel pretty confident that

00:48:34.668 --> 00:48:37.149
you're safe to return to the rest of the party.

00:48:37.149 --> 00:48:39.204
LAURA: Okay. So, we walk back.

00:48:39.204 --> 00:48:41.923
So, apparently, number one, big party,

00:48:41.923 --> 00:48:44.470
we don't want to fight them if we don't have to.

00:48:44.470 --> 00:48:47.573
Secondly, there's some weirdo creature that's gotten loose

00:48:47.573 --> 00:48:51.803
and is very, very bad and it's killed multiple duergar already.

00:48:51.803 --> 00:48:53.087
LIAM: Quickly.

00:48:53.087 --> 00:48:55.146
LAURA: That might be the thing--

00:48:55.146 --> 00:48:56.644
SAM: No indication of what kind of a creature it was?

00:48:56.644 --> 00:48:58.676
LAURA: No, but it might be the thing we already killed.

00:48:58.676 --> 00:49:01.059
It could've been the thing with the plate that 
showed up in the camp, I don't know.

00:49:01.059 --> 00:49:02.114
SAM: The thing with the plate?

00:49:02.114 --> 00:49:03.603
ASHLEY: The thing in the red rider wagon.
TRAVIS: The bullet, the bullet.

00:49:03.603 --> 00:49:04.525
LAURA: The big thing.

00:49:04.525 --> 00:49:05.702
TRAVIS: Bulette.
MARISHA: Bulé.

00:49:05.702 --> 00:49:06.952
SAM: Oh!
LAURA: It could've been that, I'm not sure.

00:49:06.952 --> 00:49:08.213
TRAVIS: It's a French dog.

00:49:08.213 --> 00:49:09.487
MARISHA: It’s French, yeah.

00:49:09.487 --> 00:49:11.165
LAURA: Regardless, we should be very careful, 
traveling forward.

00:49:11.165 --> 00:49:12.651
TALIESIN: I've seen your sheet, you don't speak French.

00:49:12.651 --> 00:49:13.647
SAM: We could use that to our advantage.

00:49:13.647 --> 00:49:15.309
ORION: We could! We could.

00:49:15.309 --> 00:49:17.438
We could scare them off quite easily.

00:49:17.438 --> 00:49:18.873
MARISHA: I had a grandmother who did, okay?

00:49:18.873 --> 00:49:21.487
LAURA: I like the way you think. All right.

00:49:21.487 --> 00:49:22.855
ORION: I can make funny sounds.

00:49:22.855 --> 00:49:24.065
LAURA: Should we keep moving forward

00:49:24.065 --> 00:49:25.238
at a very stealthy sort of pace?

00:49:25.238 --> 00:49:26.356
ORION: Waka waka.

00:49:26.356 --> 00:49:27.748
MATT: Certainly.

00:49:27.748 --> 00:49:28.931
TALIESIN: The stealthy mix.

00:49:28.931 --> 00:49:30.806
MATT: You guys push forward, keeping that wide,

00:49:30.806 --> 00:49:34.288
kind of left curve, which adds a fair amount of time

00:49:34.288 --> 00:49:37.191
to your travel, as you're being careful and moving

00:49:37.191 --> 00:49:43.114
at a very very heavy, circular arc around the duergar city.

00:49:43.114 --> 00:49:45.973
SAM: I'm looking for doors and stuff as we go.
I don't know why.

00:49:45.973 --> 00:49:48.413
MATT: Sure! Looking for doors!

00:49:48.413 --> 00:49:50.306
SAM: Well, there's a trap door somewhere, right?

00:49:50.306 --> 00:49:52.136
ORION: (old man voice) There’s doors in them there caves.

00:49:52.136 --> 00:49:53.341
MATT: Good thinking.

00:49:53.341 --> 00:49:54.783
LIAM: That'll be the fortress, maybe, but--

00:49:54.783 --> 00:49:57.012
LAURA: Possibly. Could be farther. Can we see

00:49:57.012 --> 00:50:00.123
the molten things that he was talking about?

00:50:00.123 --> 00:50:01.353
The lava flows?

00:50:01.353 --> 00:50:02.601
MATT: Still too far away.

00:50:02.601 --> 00:50:04.219
LAURA: Still too far away.

00:50:04.219 --> 00:50:05.499
MATT: As you begin to make your way around,

00:50:05.499 --> 00:50:06.887
you're just starting to get to the point where you can see

00:50:06.887 --> 00:50:08.966
the front of the fortress. And you can see where

00:50:08.966 --> 00:50:14.100
the magma fall splits and just coalesces around 
each side of the stronghold.

00:50:14.100 --> 00:50:16.398
Almost like a blanket waterfall on each side.

00:50:16.398 --> 00:50:20.113
It does split up at certain points, you can begin to start 
making it out.

00:50:20.113 --> 00:50:22.467
TALIESIN: Where does the magma runoff lead to?

00:50:22.467 --> 00:50:24.390
Does it just pour out? Does it fill a moat?

00:50:24.390 --> 00:50:26.232
MATT: It's hard to tell from this distance, unfortunately.

00:50:26.232 --> 00:50:28.926
You'd have to get closer up to see.

00:50:28.926 --> 00:50:31.275
About an hour of travel around the side--

00:50:31.275 --> 00:50:32.455
LAURA: Oh wow.

00:50:32.455 --> 00:50:33.574
LIAM: I’m so bored.

00:50:33.574 --> 00:50:36.095
LAURA: (laughs) Don't say that.

00:50:36.095 --> 00:50:38.319
MATT: (laughs) That can be fixed, Liam.

00:50:38.319 --> 00:50:39.659
(all laugh)

00:50:39.659 --> 00:50:41.088
TALIESIN: If only there were a way to just speed up

00:50:41.088 --> 00:50:41.977
this exposition somehow.

00:50:41.977 --> 00:50:43.529
TRAVIS: Of all the things.
MATT: Indeed.

00:50:43.529 --> 00:50:46.166
TALIESIN: Life isn't like that.

00:50:46.983 --> 00:50:48.637
ORION: Wow, Percy!

00:50:48.637 --> 00:50:49.544
TALIESIN: Sorry.

00:50:49.544 --> 00:50:51.254
(all laugh)

00:50:51.254 --> 00:50:52.651
LAURA: (whispering) Be quiet.

00:50:52.651 --> 00:50:56.704
MATT: It's at this point, immediately catching your eye, Vex,

00:50:56.704 --> 00:51:03.614
one of the nearby obsidian spires is a different 
color than the rest.

00:51:03.614 --> 00:51:06.814
The rest are like a deep black, glass shiny color.

00:51:06.814 --> 00:51:09.224
This one is a dull crimson.

00:51:09.224 --> 00:51:12.121
LAURA: Ooh! We should go towards that one.

00:51:12.121 --> 00:51:14.133
SAM: Because it's a different color?

00:51:14.133 --> 00:51:15.748
LIAM: Let's go check it out.

00:51:15.748 --> 00:51:17.199
MARISHA: Wait, what was the first color?

00:51:17.199 --> 00:51:19.538
I was still laughing at Percy. What?

00:51:19.538 --> 00:51:21.633
LIAM: Just eat your banana, the twins 
will go check it out.

00:51:21.633 --> 00:51:23.312
MATT: Black obsidian, this was red--

00:51:23.312 --> 00:51:24.656
MARISHA: (laughing) Red, okay.

00:51:24.656 --> 00:51:26.144
MATT: --crimson, ruddy, anyway.

00:51:26.144 --> 00:51:27.268
TALIESIN: Do you not know anything?

00:51:27.268 --> 00:51:28.322
LIAM: The twins are gonna go have a peek.

00:51:28.322 --> 00:51:28.962
MATT: Okay.

00:51:28.962 --> 00:51:30.140
SAM: I'm coming with.

00:51:30.140 --> 00:51:31.831
MATT: Scanlan comes with. Go ahead and roll a stealth check.

00:51:31.831 --> 00:51:33.118
SAM: Oh boy. (laughs)

00:51:33.118 --> 00:51:34.045
TALIESIN: I'm not coming with.

00:51:34.045 --> 00:51:35.379
SAM: Not my strong suit.

00:51:35.379 --> 00:51:36.469
TRAVIS: Don't fuck it up.

00:51:36.469 --> 00:51:37.751
LAURA: No, Scanlan, what did you do?

00:51:37.751 --> 00:51:38.799
LIAM: You dick!

00:51:38.799 --> 00:51:39.700
TRAVIS: Did you?

00:51:39.700 --> 00:51:40.657
MARISHA: What did you do?

00:51:40.657 --> 00:51:42.038
(all laugh)

00:51:42.038 --> 00:51:43.282
ORION: You can change your mind.

00:51:43.282 --> 00:51:44.292
ASHLEY: Wait, wait, I go and--

00:51:44.292 --> 00:51:45.745
SAM: I've got advantage, don't I?

00:51:45.745 --> 00:51:47.741
ASHLEY: --I grab Scanlan and I kiss him on the cheek

00:51:47.741 --> 00:51:48.839
and make him stay.

00:51:48.839 --> 00:51:51.999
(all gasp and exclaim)

00:51:51.999 --> 00:51:53.763
ORION: What?!

00:51:53.763 --> 00:51:56.143
TALIESIN: Way to take one for the team.

00:51:56.143 --> 00:51:57.442
ORION: Oh no.

00:51:57.442 --> 00:51:58.334
TRAVIS: I don't know.

00:51:58.334 --> 00:52:00.017
LIAM: You just stopped him from farting into his flute.

00:52:00.017 --> 00:52:01.933
ASHLEY: Persuasion? That would be...

00:52:01.933 --> 00:52:03.307
ORION: Ladies and gentlemen, this is a huge moment.

00:52:03.307 --> 00:52:05.441
MARISHA: Can you roll a persuasion against a critical fail?

00:52:05.441 --> 00:52:07.808
Can you? Can you persuade a crit fail?

00:52:07.808 --> 00:52:09.224
LAURA: Can you persuade the DM?

00:52:09.224 --> 00:52:10.335
ASHLEY: Wait, is it a fail?

00:52:10.335 --> 00:52:11.377
MARISHA: (laughing) Can you persuade the DM?

00:52:11.377 --> 00:52:12.327
ASHLEY: It is a 1?

00:52:12.327 --> 00:52:13.095
MATT: Okay, so it was a 1--

00:52:13.095 --> 00:52:14.265
SAM: It was a 1.
LIAM: That's a 1 face.

00:52:14.265 --> 00:52:15.208
(all laugh)

00:52:15.208 --> 00:52:16.661
LIAM: That's a 1 face.

00:52:18.878 --> 00:52:21.607
MATT: I will say, Pike, roll a perception check.

00:52:25.087 --> 00:52:26.462
ORION: d20!

00:52:26.462 --> 00:52:28.259
LAURA: Come on, come on, d20.

00:52:28.259 --> 00:52:30.161
ASHLEY: Perception?

00:52:30.161 --> 00:52:32.081
LIAM: Yes, d20. Uh, that's a half a d20.

00:52:32.081 --> 00:52:33.262
ASHLEY: 14?

00:52:33.262 --> 00:52:34.703
LAURA: (soft, high voice) No, no... yes, 14.

00:52:34.703 --> 00:52:37.720
(all laugh)

00:52:37.720 --> 00:52:38.967
SAM: I don't know.

00:52:38.967 --> 00:52:40.136
LAURA: I'll stop.

00:52:40.136 --> 00:52:42.938
MATT: Unfortunately, you're not quite perceptive enough

00:52:42.938 --> 00:52:45.583
to notice Scanlan's not quite so quiet walking away,

00:52:45.583 --> 00:52:46.990
as you're distracted by the surroundings

00:52:46.990 --> 00:52:49.070
and the circumstance locally.

00:52:49.070 --> 00:52:51.861
You continue up with the twins,

00:52:51.861 --> 00:52:54.859
absentmindedly humming to yourself.

00:52:54.859 --> 00:52:56.944
SAM: (sings softly)

00:52:56.944 --> 00:52:59.174
MATT: The twins, being used to your humming,

00:52:59.174 --> 00:53:02.494
for some reason it doesn't connect.

00:53:02.494 --> 00:53:04.888
You make your way up to the spire.

00:53:04.888 --> 00:53:07.446
At about 15, 20 feet out, you notice

00:53:07.446 --> 00:53:10.923
the coloration is different, because it is completely coated

00:53:10.923 --> 00:53:14.462
in what looks like dried blood of some kind.

00:53:14.462 --> 00:53:15.666
LIAM: Fuck.

00:53:15.666 --> 00:53:16.704
LAURA: (gasps) Oh god.

00:53:16.704 --> 00:53:18.432
MATT: And immediately to the right of it, along the ground--

00:53:18.432 --> 00:53:19.835
ORION: So grossed out.

00:53:19.835 --> 00:53:21.742
MATT: --currently your vision is obscured by another,

00:53:21.742 --> 00:53:26.122
large kind of twisted stalactite, but there appears to be

00:53:26.122 --> 00:53:30.197
an arm and a whole bunch more dried blood 
across the ground, just out of view.

00:53:30.197 --> 00:53:31.642
LAURA: (gasps) Stop! Can we stop? Can we stop?

00:53:31.642 --> 00:53:32.853
MATT: You can stop.

00:53:32.853 --> 00:53:34.152
MARISHA: An arm?

00:53:34.152 --> 00:53:35.366
LAURA: Scanlan. Shh.

00:53:35.366 --> 00:53:36.375
SAM: What? What?

00:53:36.375 --> 00:53:37.322
LAURA: (whispering) You're singing.

00:53:37.322 --> 00:53:38.804
SAM: I was singing? (whispering) I was singing?

00:53:38.804 --> 00:53:41.544
I didn't even know! It's a force of habit!

00:53:41.544 --> 00:53:45.659
LIAM: I'm going to see if I can see anything in the area

00:53:45.659 --> 00:53:48.419
that has done this recently.

00:53:48.419 --> 00:53:50.569
LAURA: Is the arm attached to whatever did--

00:53:50.569 --> 00:53:51.739
MATT: Make an investigation check.

00:53:51.739 --> 00:53:53.048
LIAM: Investigation check?

00:53:53.048 --> 00:53:54.754
LAURA: --Is the arm part of a dead thing or is it alive?

00:53:54.754 --> 00:53:56.415
MATT: It's on the ground.

00:53:56.415 --> 00:53:58.465
TRAVIS: I'm pretty sure whatever it is, it's dead.

00:53:58.465 --> 00:53:59.176
LIAM: 7.

00:53:59.176 --> 00:54:00.107
MATT: 7?

00:54:00.107 --> 00:54:01.680
LAURA: Can I check it out as well? I mean, I'm there, 
I might as well.

00:54:01.680 --> 00:54:02.983
MATT: You can also attempt to make an investigation check.

00:54:02.983 --> 00:54:04.003
LIAM: Clever. There you go.

00:54:04.003 --> 00:54:06.095
LAURA: Wait, I'm doing advantage, too, just in case.

00:54:06.095 --> 00:54:07.595
Okay, that one's better.

00:54:07.595 --> 00:54:09.023
LIAM: Oh, I can get advantage?

00:54:09.023 --> 00:54:10.471
SAM: You get advantage on investigation?

00:54:10.471 --> 00:54:12.234
LAURA: No, I got it because I'm fucking 
in my favored terrain.

00:54:12.234 --> 00:54:13.049
(all laugh)

00:54:13.049 --> 00:54:13.883
LAURA: 21.

00:54:13.883 --> 00:54:15.872
MARISHA: You walk up in this terrain.

00:54:15.872 --> 00:54:19.215
MATT: The state of the blood that you see around

00:54:19.215 --> 00:54:24.347
seems to indicate that this has transpired over some time.

00:54:24.347 --> 00:54:27.619
You're guessing probably within a few days, if not a week,

00:54:27.619 --> 00:54:29.278
since this happened.

00:54:29.278 --> 00:54:30.477
LIAM: I'm picking up one of the arms--

00:54:30.477 --> 00:54:31.414
LAURA: (Gasps)

00:54:31.414 --> 00:54:32.502
LIAM: --to bring back to the group.

00:54:32.502 --> 00:54:35.003
MATT: Okay, so as you walk up towards the arm to grab it,

00:54:35.003 --> 00:54:36.796
you have more of a view of what's happened.

00:54:36.796 --> 00:54:39.057
And what you see before you are definitely remnants

00:54:39.057 --> 00:54:41.895
of some battle long past.

00:54:41.895 --> 00:54:43.660
LAURA: This is the skelly pile.

00:54:43.660 --> 00:54:45.554
MATT: Against these rocky formations there's 
dried blood everywhere.

00:54:45.554 --> 00:54:46.520
LIAM: Not pretty.

00:54:46.520 --> 00:54:49.024
MATT: This terrible bloodbath, whatever this event was,

00:54:49.024 --> 00:54:51.717
it was probably a horrible thing to see.

00:54:51.717 --> 00:54:54.201
There are pieces of duergar flung about.

00:54:54.201 --> 00:54:57.088
And I say pieces - the only reason you know duergar

00:54:57.088 --> 00:54:59.855
were there is because occasionally you see 
part of a head, or part of a foot.

00:54:59.855 --> 00:55:02.441
And you recognize the ashy skin from the areas

00:55:02.441 --> 00:55:05.219
that aren't currently caked with its own gore.

00:55:05.219 --> 00:55:07.558
LIAM: (gagging sounds)

00:55:08.381 --> 00:55:12.548
MATT: From what you can tell, because of 
your investigation check,

00:55:14.631 --> 00:55:17.084
the remains are torn apart by no blade.

00:55:17.084 --> 00:55:22.686
There's no cuts, there's no clean wounds.

00:55:22.686 --> 00:55:25.212
They're either pulled apart by force--

00:55:25.212 --> 00:55:26.549
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:55:26.549 --> 00:55:28.968
MATT: --like, arms and limbs were wrenched from the body

00:55:28.968 --> 00:55:30.435
just out of sheer power.

00:55:30.435 --> 00:55:31.839
TRAVIS: Like a Wookiee.

00:55:31.839 --> 00:55:35.208
MATT: Or there appears to be some sort of gnawing,

00:55:35.208 --> 00:55:38.073
some chewing, like toothy fangs, sharp teeth

00:55:38.073 --> 00:55:41.143
have partially eaten portions of these bodies.

00:55:41.143 --> 00:55:43.062
LIAM: This is the work of a beaver.

00:55:43.062 --> 00:55:44.555
LAURA: Yes, definitely, a very large beaver.

00:55:44.555 --> 00:55:46.026
ORION: A busy beaver.

00:55:46.026 --> 00:55:47.462
SAM: I think it's suicide.

00:55:47.462 --> 00:55:49.759
(all laugh)

00:55:49.759 --> 00:55:52.384
LAURA: Based on tracking and everything and insight,

00:55:52.384 --> 00:55:56.376
can we tell if that creature is anywhere nearby? 
Or if it's gone?

00:55:56.376 --> 00:55:57.714
ORION: I think it might be foul play, actually.

00:55:57.714 --> 00:55:59.067
MATT: From what you can tell--

00:55:59.067 --> 00:56:00.278
LIAM: It happened in the past.

00:56:00.278 --> 00:56:02.347
MATT: --Yeah, it happened quite some time ago.

00:56:02.347 --> 00:56:05.338
Looking at the tracks, you can see duergar feet,

00:56:05.338 --> 00:56:07.830
you can see other creatures that resemble

00:56:07.830 --> 00:56:11.612
those hook horrors that you encountered earlier 
during the lava pool.

00:56:11.612 --> 00:56:14.342
However, there's a series of tracks that you haven't seen.

00:56:14.342 --> 00:56:19.986
Well, there is very erratic footsteps that look human size,

00:56:19.996 --> 00:56:23.057
but they seem to be placed randomly,

00:56:23.057 --> 00:56:25.111
like one foot here, one foot here, one foot here.

00:56:25.111 --> 00:56:28.965
LAURA: (gasps) It's that big creature that - it was like
one of those things that that thing put together, like--

00:56:28.965 --> 00:56:32.555
MATT: And you see what seem like strange strikes

00:56:32.555 --> 00:56:34.308
through the sand, like someone had been dragged

00:56:34.308 --> 00:56:38.319
very quickly in a very localized spot, scattered all about.

00:56:38.319 --> 00:56:40.698
LIAM: It's a human centipede.

00:56:40.698 --> 00:56:42.572
SAM: It is. It's a human centipede.

00:56:42.572 --> 00:56:44.867
MATT: It's a very strange pattern that you can't

00:56:44.867 --> 00:56:47.455
really grasp what kind of creature would make it.

00:56:47.455 --> 00:56:50.771
LAURA: And it seems like it was here recently,
or a while ago?

00:56:50.771 --> 00:56:53.165
MATT: Best you can tell, the last time it was here was

00:56:53.165 --> 00:56:57.221
about two or three days ago, to feast on more of the remains.

00:56:57.221 --> 00:56:58.730
LIAM: Human? Human footprints?

00:56:58.730 --> 00:56:59.818
LAURA: Should we get out of here?

00:56:59.818 --> 00:57:00.735
MATT: Human sized.

00:57:00.735 --> 00:57:01.600
LIAM: Human sized.

00:57:01.600 --> 00:57:02.674
TRAVIS: Or set a trap.

00:57:02.674 --> 00:57:04.143
LAURA: We could try to set a trap, or we could

00:57:04.143 --> 00:57:08.270
look and see if we can loot anything?

00:57:08.270 --> 00:57:09.892
Is there anything to loot?

00:57:09.892 --> 00:57:11.639
Does it look like anything shiny?

00:57:11.639 --> 00:57:14.097
MATT: Any semblance of armor that belonged to any

00:57:14.097 --> 00:57:20.252
of these individuals is in such tatters that it's unusable.

00:57:20.252 --> 00:57:24.033
You do manage to find, across some of the body parts,

00:57:24.033 --> 00:57:27.670
a couple of blood-soaked gold coin purses.

00:57:27.670 --> 00:57:28.655
LAURA: Okay.

00:57:28.655 --> 00:57:31.071
MARISHA: Take it.
LAURA: I like gold.

00:57:31.071 --> 00:57:33.002
MATT: One of them contains a handful of gems.

00:57:33.002 --> 00:57:34.081
LAURA: Ooh!

00:57:34.081 --> 00:57:35.661
MARISHA: Gems.

00:57:35.661 --> 00:57:38.925
MATT: Yes, those right there. So you can mark that down,

00:57:38.925 --> 00:57:42.424
until you get a chance to appraise them.

00:57:42.424 --> 00:57:45.166
LIAM: I don't think we want to tangle with this.

00:57:45.166 --> 00:57:47.414
What are we trying to prove? 
Let's just keep trucking.

00:57:47.414 --> 00:57:49.585
SAM: I'm really bad at stealthing, we should go.

00:57:49.585 --> 00:57:51.463
(all laugh)

00:57:51.463 --> 00:57:52.823
SAM: We should leave.

00:57:52.823 --> 00:57:55.251
LIAM: Also, put the accordion back 
in the bag, all right?

00:57:55.251 --> 00:58:00.911
SAM: Was I doing that? It's force of habit,
I don't - it's like breathing.

00:58:00.911 --> 00:58:02.387
LIAM: Yeah, we're going to go back to the group,

00:58:02.387 --> 00:58:03.832
I'm going to bring the arm.

00:58:03.832 --> 00:58:05.265
TRAVIS: I take out the cask of ale and pour

00:58:05.265 --> 00:58:08.868
a little tankard of ale, just because I'm bored.

00:58:08.868 --> 00:58:10.037
ASHLEY: Have a sip sip.

00:58:10.037 --> 00:58:11.881
MATT: Good man. Well done. It's very tasty.

00:58:11.881 --> 00:58:15.047
TRAVIS: Would anyone else like a sip? Keyleth?

00:58:15.047 --> 00:58:17.477
MATT: Having been underground for what probably amounts

00:58:17.477 --> 00:58:20.288
now to four or five days, that little 
taste of ale on your lips

00:58:20.288 --> 00:58:22.865
is a very welcoming and very refreshing sensation.

00:58:22.865 --> 00:58:25.056
TRAVIS: It's good shit, right?

00:58:25.056 --> 00:58:26.862
ASHLEY: Oh, delicious. Oh no, I'm drunk!
Just kidding.

00:58:26.862 --> 00:58:28.494
(all laugh)

00:58:28.494 --> 00:58:30.837
ASHLEY: That was fast! Just kidding.

00:58:30.837 --> 00:58:31.925
LIAM: When we get back to the group,

00:58:31.925 --> 00:58:33.249
I'm going to toss the arm to Grog.

00:58:33.249 --> 00:58:35.029
MATT: Grog, you instinctively reach up and catch it.

00:58:35.029 --> 00:58:36.211
You look down and see what looks like

00:58:36.211 --> 00:58:38.141
a duergar arm that has been very heavily mangled.

00:58:38.141 --> 00:58:39.771
TRAVIS: Oh! Thanks for the hand!

00:58:39.771 --> 00:58:42.239
(all laugh)

00:58:42.239 --> 00:58:43.596
LIAM: It's a back scratcher.

00:58:43.596 --> 00:58:44.859
ORION: That was clever, Grog!

00:58:44.859 --> 00:58:46.049
LAURA: Well, we killed a lot of duergar this time.

00:58:46.049 --> 00:58:47.515
TRAVIS: Don't negative anything. It was a good joke.

00:58:47.515 --> 00:58:48.453
(all laugh)

00:58:48.453 --> 00:58:50.645
MATT: It was a good joke. I considered it, but no.

00:58:50.645 --> 00:58:51.714
TRAVIS: Have mercy!

00:58:51.714 --> 00:58:53.615
ORION: That was a good joke.

00:58:53.615 --> 00:58:56.420
LAURA: There's a big centipede-y 
human, creepy creature

00:58:56.420 --> 00:58:57.945
that's killed a lot of things and we should probably

00:58:57.945 --> 00:58:59.994
avoid that at all costs.

00:58:59.994 --> 00:59:01.337
ORION: I would agree with that.

00:59:01.337 --> 00:59:02.641
LIAM: If we have to, we will, but--

00:59:02.641 --> 00:59:03.975
TALIESIN: That seems fair.

00:59:03.975 --> 00:59:07.059
LAURA: Can we avoid that and still 
head left of the keep?

00:59:07.059 --> 00:59:08.551
MATT: You haven't seen a creature.

00:59:08.551 --> 00:59:10.245
SAM: Wait, we didn't make it into the -

00:59:10.245 --> 00:59:12.176
was there a structure that we could have entered?

00:59:12.176 --> 00:59:13.295
LAURA: That's where we're going.

00:59:13.295 --> 00:59:14.742
LIAM &amp;amp; MATT: You're heading towards that structure.

00:59:14.742 --> 00:59:15.973
SAM: Okay. But I mean, where we just were?

00:59:15.973 --> 00:59:17.040
ORION: The magma fortress.

00:59:17.040 --> 00:59:18.243
MATT: Where you just were? No, there's just all these

00:59:18.243 --> 00:59:19.774
giant rocky spires jutting out of the ground.

00:59:19.774 --> 00:59:21.025
LIAM: Spike coated in dried blood.

00:59:21.025 --> 00:59:22.195
SAM: They didn't have doors in them?

00:59:22.195 --> 00:59:23.427
LAURA: Should we probably have looked for like a nest?

00:59:23.427 --> 00:59:24.262
MATT: There were no doors.

00:59:24.262 --> 00:59:25.241
SAM: Okay, good. I'm looking for a door!

00:59:25.241 --> 00:59:26.561
LIAM: No, we should just keep going.

00:59:26.561 --> 00:59:27.811
If we're going to run into it, we're going to run into it.

00:59:27.811 --> 00:59:28.566
Let's not find it.

00:59:28.566 --> 00:59:29.688
LAURA: Yeah.

00:59:29.688 --> 00:59:31.177
MATT: It appears like there was, at one point in time,

00:59:31.177 --> 00:59:32.381
some very intense seismic activity in this area that

00:59:32.381 --> 00:59:33.694
created this cavern, and whatever is the source

00:59:33.694 --> 00:59:37.280
of a lot of this perpetually flowing, molten rock.

00:59:37.280 --> 00:59:41.980
That's why the entire terrain here is so dangerous and uninviting,

00:59:41.980 --> 00:59:45.726
is because of the sheer force that went into its creation.

00:59:45.726 --> 00:59:46.653
SAM: Okay.

00:59:46.653 --> 00:59:48.513
LAURA: So we should just keep freaking being careful

00:59:48.513 --> 00:59:49.752
and keep going towards the giant thing.

00:59:49.752 --> 00:59:50.715
SAM: Okay. Let's go.

00:59:50.715 --> 00:59:51.630
ASHLEY: Keep trucking on.

00:59:51.630 --> 00:59:53.949
SAM: Pike, I have this weird feeling,

00:59:53.949 --> 00:59:56.528
like you wanted to make out with me.

00:59:56.528 --> 00:59:59.325
Is that something that happened? 
Am I dreaming?

00:59:59.325 --> 01:00:02.189
ASHLEY: Well, you just, you know, you weren't
paying attention.

01:00:02.189 --> 01:00:03.372
SAM: Really?

01:00:03.372 --> 01:00:04.903
LAURA: And that makes you want to 
make out with him?

01:00:04.903 --> 01:00:07.922
ASHLEY: No, I think you were moving 
along to try to go stealth

01:00:07.922 --> 01:00:11.482
and sometimes you should just stay 
put and see what happens.

01:00:11.482 --> 01:00:13.476
(all laugh)

01:00:13.476 --> 01:00:16.209
ORION: Well said, cleric!

01:00:16.209 --> 01:00:19.068
LIAM: That was the most adorable diss in history.

01:00:19.068 --> 01:00:21.083
(all laugh)

01:00:21.083 --> 01:00:22.124
TALIESIN: That was cold.

01:00:22.124 --> 01:00:23.287
SAM: All right.

01:00:23.287 --> 01:00:24.298
ORION: Yet inviting.

01:00:24.298 --> 01:00:26.126
TRAVIS: It's all right, Scanlan. 
We'll go pay for it later.

01:00:26.126 --> 01:00:28.428
(all laugh)

01:00:28.428 --> 01:00:30.623
MATT: A small hit to Scanlan's morale,

01:00:30.623 --> 01:00:33.415
but the party marches on.

01:00:33.415 --> 01:00:35.340
LIAM: You lose an inspiration die.

01:00:35.340 --> 01:00:36.256
(all laugh)

01:00:36.256 --> 01:00:38.731
TRAVIS: Disadvantage on whatever roll.

01:00:40.291 --> 01:00:41.701
SAM: I deserved it, I deserved it.

01:00:41.701 --> 01:00:43.737
LIAM: Okay, twins in front, here we go.

01:00:43.737 --> 01:00:44.654
LAURA: Let's keep going.

01:00:44.654 --> 01:00:46.755
MATT: Twins in front. You guys 
continue to push forward.

01:00:46.755 --> 01:00:48.763
For the sake of the length of this journey,

01:00:48.763 --> 01:00:50.134
I'm going to have the party go ahead and

01:00:50.134 --> 01:00:52.510
roll a communal stealth check once more.

01:00:53.893 --> 01:00:55.395
MARISHA: I still have Pass Without A Trace up.

01:00:55.395 --> 01:00:56.704
TALIESIN: Oh, for the love of god.

01:00:56.704 --> 01:00:58.181
MARISHA: Which gives everyone a plus 10.

01:00:58.181 --> 01:00:59.595
LAURA: Oh, really?!

01:00:59.595 --> 01:01:00.691
MATT: Yes.

01:01:00.691 --> 01:01:01.767
LIAM: Percy! Don't bang the guns together.

01:01:01.767 --> 01:01:03.148
TALIESIN: Yeah, that happened too.

01:01:03.148 --> 01:01:04.006
ORION: 24.

01:01:04.006 --> 01:01:04.733
MATT: 24?

01:01:04.733 --> 01:01:05.478
SAM: 19.

01:01:05.478 --> 01:01:06.306
LIAM: We all have plus 10?

01:01:06.306 --> 01:01:06.937
MATT: Yes.

01:01:06.937 --> 01:01:07.634
LAURA: And this is plus 10, already?

01:01:07.634 --> 01:01:08.389
SAM: Yes.

01:01:08.389 --> 01:01:09.437
TALIESIN: I rolled a 1.

01:01:09.437 --> 01:01:10.205
MATT: Okay.

01:01:10.205 --> 01:01:11.928
(all groan)

01:01:11.928 --> 01:01:12.658
LAURA: Oh, Percy!

01:01:12.658 --> 01:01:13.813
SAM: I kiss Percy!

01:01:13.813 --> 01:01:15.069
(all laugh)

01:01:15.069 --> 01:01:16.799
TALIESIN: What?! Ah!

01:01:16.799 --> 01:01:19.399
SAM: I don’t know! I thought it might help.

01:01:19.399 --> 01:01:21.527
ORION: You have to use the tongue, Scanlan.

01:01:21.527 --> 01:01:22.895
MARISHA: 23.

01:01:22.895 --> 01:01:24.404
SAM: Is that bubblegum?

01:01:24.404 --> 01:01:25.186
MATT: Okay. Grog?

01:01:25.186 --> 01:01:25.838
TRAVIS: 26.

01:01:25.838 --> 01:01:26.790
ASHLEY: 3.

01:01:26.790 --> 01:01:28.121
TALIESIN: I have a habit.

01:01:28.121 --> 01:01:29.030
LAURA: (gasps) You have a plus 10.

01:01:29.030 --> 01:01:29.972
ASHLEY: Oh! I get to do plus 10 bonus to that?
MATT: Yes.

01:01:29.972 --> 01:01:30.972
ASHLEY: 13!

01:01:30.972 --> 01:01:31.933
MATT: All right, so that's three failures.

01:01:31.933 --> 01:01:32.874
LAURA: 30.

01:01:32.874 --> 01:01:33.611
MARISHA: Three failures?

01:01:33.611 --> 01:01:34.335
LIAM: 32.

01:01:34.335 --> 01:01:35.296
MATT: Okay, good.

01:01:35.296 --> 01:01:36.167
TALIESIN: (relieved) Ah!

01:01:36.167 --> 01:01:37.465
MATT: More than half you guys succeeded.

01:01:37.465 --> 01:01:39.636
That bit is key. A one is two failures.

01:01:39.636 --> 01:01:41.118
LAURA: Oh no!

01:01:41.118 --> 01:01:42.328
ASHLEY: I'm not stealthy, man.

01:01:42.328 --> 01:01:43.466
MARISHA: A one is two failures?

01:01:43.466 --> 01:01:45.572
MATT: A one is considered two failures for this challenge.

01:01:45.572 --> 01:01:46.823
Pushing forward--

01:01:46.823 --> 01:01:47.699
TALIESIN: Now you roll well.

01:01:47.699 --> 01:01:49.385
MATT: --you manage to stop Percy and find out

01:01:49.385 --> 01:01:53.083
the root of this audio problem.

01:01:53.083 --> 01:01:54.778
Pushing forward, you manage to make your way

01:01:54.778 --> 01:01:59.604
about a quarter mile on the outskirts of this cluster of buildings.

01:01:59.604 --> 01:02:03.995
Curving far left, you're just managing to keep out of the city proper

01:02:03.995 --> 01:02:07.927
and move straight towards the very back wall of this cavern,

01:02:07.927 --> 01:02:13.083
which is buttressed against - 
what this fortress is built against.

01:02:13.083 --> 01:02:17.290
So you're circumventing the city to go 
straight to this fortress.

01:02:17.290 --> 01:02:23.398
As you're moving, about a quarter mile 
from the stronghold,

01:02:23.398 --> 01:02:29.429
Vex, you pick up a strange person

01:02:29.429 --> 01:02:32.894
standing maybe about 50, 60 feet ahead of you.

01:02:34.170 --> 01:02:35.733
LAURA: Just a person?

01:02:35.733 --> 01:02:38.306
MATT: Just a person, it looks like.

01:02:38.306 --> 01:02:40.495
LAURA &amp;amp; ORION: (worried laughter)

01:02:40.495 --> 01:02:42.421
LAURA: Can they see us? Does it look like they
can see us?

01:02:42.421 --> 01:02:44.258
MATT: You take a moment, keeping an eye out,

01:02:44.258 --> 01:02:48.244
and the person isn't moving. Just standing right there.

01:02:48.244 --> 01:02:51.535
LAURA: (whispering) So. There's a person standing right there.

01:02:51.535 --> 01:02:52.986
MARISHA: (whispering) What?

01:02:52.986 --> 01:02:54.597
LAURA: (whispering) A person. He's just standing there.

01:02:54.597 --> 01:02:56.414
MATT: It's too dark to make out any details, unfortunately.

01:02:56.414 --> 01:02:58.291
LAURA: No. Hmm.

01:02:58.291 --> 01:02:59.742
SAM: Could be good, could be bad. 
We have no idea.

01:02:59.742 --> 01:03:03.581
LIAM: Can I see him now that she's 
pointed him out to me?

01:03:03.581 --> 01:03:04.584
SAM: I can hold him. Might piss him off.

01:03:04.584 --> 01:03:05.668
TRAVIS: At least do the hold.

01:03:05.668 --> 01:03:06.556
MATT: You can see it.

01:03:06.556 --> 01:03:07.900
And there is a humanoid, standing on its own.

01:03:07.900 --> 01:03:09.888
LIAM: It doesn't seem to be moving, though.

01:03:09.888 --> 01:03:11.825
LAURA: Maybe it's a scarecrow?
LIAM: Maybe it's a statue.

01:03:11.825 --> 01:03:12.755
LAURA: Yeah, that's what I mean.

01:03:12.755 --> 01:03:13.690
TRAVIS: A statue?

01:03:13.690 --> 01:03:14.495
SAM: Want me to go check it out?

01:03:14.495 --> 01:03:15.529
LIAM: No! I don’t!

01:03:15.529 --> 01:03:16.609
LAURA: Can't you go invisible?

01:03:16.609 --> 01:03:17.977
SAM: Yes, I can go invisible.

01:03:17.977 --> 01:03:19.825
LAURA: Go invisible and check it out.

01:03:19.825 --> 01:03:24.517
SAM: I polymorph and turn into a fly and I buzz over.

01:03:24.517 --> 01:03:26.033
MARISHA: Oh, yay! That's fun.

01:03:26.033 --> 01:03:27.837
LIAM: Good job, gnome nuts.

01:03:27.837 --> 01:03:30.623
LAURA: Oh no, if he's magic, he's going to know.

01:03:30.623 --> 01:03:34.468
SAM: It's all right. I've got magic, too.

01:03:36.588 --> 01:03:39.887
MATT: You approach this individual and 
notice it is unmoving

01:03:39.887 --> 01:03:42.701
and is of a singular, solid color.

01:03:42.701 --> 01:03:44.121
LAURA: (whispering) It's a statue.

01:03:44.121 --> 01:03:48.417
MATT: What looks to be what is an illithid 
or a mind flayer

01:03:48.417 --> 01:03:52.899
is currently locked in some sort of reactionary position,

01:03:52.899 --> 01:03:54.568
but is completely turned to stone.

01:03:54.568 --> 01:03:55.825
LAURA: Oh no!

01:03:55.825 --> 01:03:56.813
MARISHA: Oh shit.

01:03:56.813 --> 01:03:58.170
SAM: Like a Medusa type of a thing?

01:03:58.170 --> 01:04:01.880
LIAM: We faced basilisks once and they did this to Vex'ahlia.

01:04:01.880 --> 01:04:03.271
TRAVIS: We've got basilisk eggs.

01:04:03.271 --> 01:04:04.740
MARISHA: There's a lot of things that can do this, 
actually, to be fair.

01:04:04.740 --> 01:04:06.379
LAURA: We do have basilisk eggs in the bag of holding.

01:04:06.379 --> 01:04:07.825
TRAVIS: Yeah, we’ve got eight of them.

01:04:07.825 --> 01:04:11.038
Maybe we should crack one on statue guy.

01:04:11.038 --> 01:04:16.164
SAM: I buzz back to the group. (buzzing)

01:04:16.164 --> 01:04:18.179
LAURA: Oh, what's that? Oh, it's Scanlan.

01:04:18.179 --> 01:04:20.183
SAM: I kind of fuck with Tiberius's ear a little bit.

01:04:20.183 --> 01:04:21.289
(all laugh)

01:04:21.289 --> 01:04:22.697
ORION: Oh, Scanlan, stop it!

01:04:22.697 --> 01:04:23.994
SAM: And I turn back.

01:04:23.994 --> 01:04:25.029
(all laugh)

01:04:25.029 --> 01:04:26.279
TRAVIS: Well, what did you see?

01:04:26.279 --> 01:04:27.193
LAURA: What was it?

01:04:27.193 --> 01:04:28.864
SAM: A crazy statue of a crazy illithid.

01:04:28.864 --> 01:04:30.655
LIAM: That's crazy.

01:04:30.655 --> 01:04:32.568
LAURA: Can we look at Clarota and say:

01:04:32.568 --> 01:04:34.897
“Do you know anything about this?”

01:04:34.897 --> 01:04:37.200
MATT: Clarota kind of thinks for a second and goes:

01:04:37.200 --> 01:04:42.458
(breathy, raspy voice) “As far as I've noticed, occasionally

01:04:42.458 --> 01:04:50.235
“these patrols do walk with a lizard creature that 
has this ability.

01:04:50.235 --> 01:04:55.874
“It's generally used as a threatening device

01:04:55.874 --> 01:04:59.992
“or a guardian amongst the city.”

01:04:59.992 --> 01:05:02.027
MARISHA: Oh! So the duergar--

01:05:02.027 --> 01:05:03.540
LAURA: Have basilisks.

01:05:03.540 --> 01:05:06.524
MARISHA: --have this as, like, their pets?

01:05:06.524 --> 01:05:08.999
MATT: “A trained beast, yes.”

01:05:08.999 --> 01:05:13.167
LIAM: Why do you suppose they used it 
on one of their own?

01:05:13.167 --> 01:05:16.634
MATT: “I can only imagine maybe this transpired

01:05:16.634 --> 01:05:22.475
“before the union and is left as a warning.”

01:05:22.475 --> 01:05:24.210
LIAM: So it's a duergar pet?

01:05:24.210 --> 01:05:26.086
LAURA: Do we remember how to take care of basilisks?

01:05:26.086 --> 01:05:27.837
Like, do we not look at them, is that how they don't--

01:05:27.837 --> 01:05:29.865
LIAM: Don't look at them. That's correct.

01:05:29.865 --> 01:05:31.722
LAURA: Don't look them in the eye?
Or don't look at their face?

01:05:31.722 --> 01:05:33.011
LIAM: Yes, that's it. It's a vision thing.

01:05:33.011 --> 01:05:34.689
LAURA: Yes?
TALIESIN: Yes, I believe it's vision based.

01:05:34.689 --> 01:05:35.572
LAURA: Okay.

01:05:35.572 --> 01:05:37.335
MATT: This would be a nature check.

01:05:37.335 --> 01:05:38.537
TALIESIN: Double check.

01:05:38.537 --> 01:05:39.860
MATT: For anyone who wishes to make one.

01:05:39.860 --> 01:05:41.242
MARISHA: I'll do that.

01:05:41.242 --> 01:05:42.210
TRAVIS: Me too.

01:05:42.210 --> 01:05:43.059
(all laugh)

01:05:43.059 --> 01:05:44.161
TALIESIN: 23. Natural 20.

01:05:44.161 --> 01:05:45.286
LAURA: Oh, well, never mind. He's got it.

01:05:45.286 --> 01:05:46.572
ORION: Very good, yay!

01:05:46.572 --> 01:05:48.033
MARISHA: Oh, well, I'll stop there.

01:05:48.033 --> 01:05:49.226
TRAVIS: Just go ahead and dunk on everybody, 
why don't you?

01:05:49.226 --> 01:05:50.275
MATT: Natural 20.

01:05:54.205 --> 01:05:57.829
Essentially it is a sight-based circumstance.

01:05:57.829 --> 01:06:01.345
TALIESIN: It's entirely visual. They have to catch your gaze

01:06:01.345 --> 01:06:04.345
and then that is how they can turn you into stone.

01:06:04.345 --> 01:06:07.146
Otherwise, as long as you don't catch
their gaze, you'll be fine.

01:06:07.146 --> 01:06:08.242
LAURA: All right.

01:06:08.242 --> 01:06:09.602
LIAM: All right. It's a good thing we've all been watching

01:06:09.602 --> 01:06:10.761
Daredevil last week.

01:06:10.761 --> 01:06:12.405
TRAVIS: So, look them in the eye? Got it.

01:06:12.405 --> 01:06:13.351
(all laugh)

01:06:13.351 --> 01:06:14.608
TALIESIN: Yes! Very helpful.

01:06:14.608 --> 01:06:16.146
TRAVIS: Let's go.

01:06:16.146 --> 01:06:18.807
MARISHA: Poor basilisks. Can never make eye contact.

01:06:18.807 --> 01:06:19.882
SAM: We're going on?

01:06:19.882 --> 01:06:20.765
TRAVIS: Yeah!

01:06:20.765 --> 01:06:21.729
LAURA: Yeah, let's keep going.

01:06:21.729 --> 01:06:25.040
MATT: As you guys push forward, Clarota lags 
behind a little bit to inspect the statue.

01:06:25.040 --> 01:06:26.496
Kind of looks it over for a second--

01:06:26.496 --> 01:06:28.458
LAURA: Did you know him?

01:06:28.458 --> 01:06:30.331
MATT: (low, breathy voice) “Uh…”

01:06:30.331 --> 01:06:31.651
SAM: Dave.

01:06:31.651 --> 01:06:33.709
MATT: (laughing) Goddamn it!

01:06:33.709 --> 01:06:35.464
(all laugh)

01:06:35.464 --> 01:06:39.098
ORION: I don't think his name was Dave, Scanlan.

01:06:39.098 --> 01:06:40.836
MATT: He takes a moment to look over and you can see

01:06:40.836 --> 01:06:43.381
his eyes close slightly for a second.

01:06:43.381 --> 01:06:46.130
(raspy, breathy voice) “Aye, we've met.

01:06:46.130 --> 01:06:51.871
“Not the kindest of my people, but, nevertheless,

01:06:51.871 --> 01:06:55.710
“should all this pass, I would like to, maybe,

01:06:55.710 --> 01:06:59.386
“release him from this stony prison.”

01:06:59.386 --> 01:07:01.513
LAURA: So you know how to do that?

01:07:01.513 --> 01:07:04.408
MATT: “I know not, but it can be done. I've seen it.”

01:07:04.408 --> 01:07:05.501
LAURA: Didn't we do that?

01:07:05.501 --> 01:07:06.255
ORION: Yes.

01:07:06.255 --> 01:07:07.683
LAURA: Didn't we have to do that?

01:07:07.683 --> 01:07:10.147
LIAM: We sprinkled some of its blood on your eyes,

01:07:10.147 --> 01:07:11.591
if I remember correctly.

01:07:11.591 --> 01:07:12.464
ORION: Yes!

01:07:12.464 --> 01:07:13.388
LAURA: I turned to stone?

01:07:13.388 --> 01:07:14.347
MATT: You did.

01:07:14.347 --> 01:07:15.680
LIAM: You did. I was very sad.

01:07:15.680 --> 01:07:17.196
ORION: Yes, that's correct. 
We used the blood of the creature.

01:07:17.196 --> 01:07:18.862
LAURA: I remember, I remember. 
Yeah, I remember that.

01:07:18.862 --> 01:07:20.819
MATT: Essentially, there is a liquid that can be

01:07:20.819 --> 01:07:24.173
distilled from the basilisk blood.

01:07:24.173 --> 01:07:25.532
LAURA: Okay.

01:07:25.532 --> 01:07:27.542
TRAVIS: We don't have any more of that.

01:07:27.542 --> 01:07:28.727
MATT: You do not.

01:07:28.727 --> 01:07:29.999
LAURA: Okay. So we'll be careful.

01:07:29.999 --> 01:07:31.064
TRAVIS: Dragon blood for fucking days.

01:07:31.064 --> 01:07:32.275
LIAM: We also don't know if it's a basilisk.

01:07:32.275 --> 01:07:34.058
SAM: Should we move this statue off to a safe place,

01:07:34.058 --> 01:07:35.393
inside or anything?

01:07:35.393 --> 01:07:36.467
LAURA: Nah, fuck it.
SAM: It's fine here, it's fine.

01:07:36.467 --> 01:07:37.435
LIAM: No, it's heavy.

01:07:37.435 --> 01:07:38.448
LAURA: Let's just keep going.

01:07:38.448 --> 01:07:39.545
MARISHA: It's been there for a while.

01:07:39.545 --> 01:07:40.800
TALIESIN: Let's not give anybody any indication 
we've been here.

01:07:40.800 --> 01:07:41.831
LAURA: It's got bat poo on it, let's keep going.

01:07:41.831 --> 01:07:42.920
SAM: Okay.

01:07:42.920 --> 01:07:47.092
MATT: As you guys press forward, about another 20 or so

01:07:47.092 --> 01:07:52.597
minutes, you now have a much better view 
of the left side of Emberhold proper.

01:07:52.597 --> 01:07:55.679
And you can see the large magma fall

01:07:55.679 --> 01:07:59.772
that is pouring over the top of the fortress's second story

01:07:59.772 --> 01:08:01.329
and completely encompasses that side.

01:08:01.329 --> 01:08:04.358
It splits and divides towards the center -

01:08:04.358 --> 01:08:06.858
a larger fall towards the front of the fortress

01:08:06.858 --> 01:08:08.645
and a thinner one towards the very back.

01:08:08.645 --> 01:08:10.304
LAURA: (whispering) Thin one! Thin one!

01:08:10.304 --> 01:08:11.674
TRAVIS: Yeah, let's go towards the door.

01:08:11.674 --> 01:08:12.866
LIAM: All right, creeping back.

01:08:12.866 --> 01:08:14.137
LAURA: Yeah! Creepy, creepy, creepy towards the thin one.

01:08:14.137 --> 01:08:15.177
LIAM: The creeps are creeping.

01:08:15.177 --> 01:08:16.143
MATT: Okay.

01:08:16.143 --> 01:08:17.481
LIAM: We're in stealth, still, or...?

01:08:17.481 --> 01:08:18.482
TRAVIS: Yeah, we're all stealthed.

01:08:18.482 --> 01:08:19.290
MATT: For you, it'd be stealth.

01:08:19.290 --> 01:08:20.334
Yeah, you guys are all stealthed still.

01:08:20.334 --> 01:08:21.018
LAURA: Okay.

01:08:21.018 --> 01:08:21.635
MARISHA: We're rolling again?

01:08:21.635 --> 01:08:22.289
LIAM: 26.

01:08:22.289 --> 01:08:24.815
LAURA: You don't to need check it again, 
he didn't tell us to.

01:08:24.815 --> 01:08:26.640
LIAM: Oh. Well, I said I wanted to go back and look.

01:08:26.640 --> 01:08:27.478
LAURA: Oh.

01:08:27.478 --> 01:08:30.164
MATT: So you move ahead of the rest of the group

01:08:30.164 --> 01:08:32.480
and head to the front of this stream.

01:08:32.480 --> 01:08:37.857
And you can see the smooth wall with molten rock

01:08:37.857 --> 01:08:39.579
pouring down the side, and you can see where

01:08:39.579 --> 01:08:43.843
portions of the stone have been 
gradually worn and melted

01:08:43.843 --> 01:08:46.376
by just the contact, but then built upon by

01:08:46.376 --> 01:08:51.270
more and more cooled rock. 
This is a very weird clustered

01:08:51.270 --> 01:08:54.486
framing of cooled rock around this fall.

01:08:54.486 --> 01:08:57.842
You see no doorway, as the actual magma is pressing

01:08:57.842 --> 01:09:00.851
directly against the side of the stronghold.

01:09:00.851 --> 01:09:03.171
LIAM: Right, I want to see if I can tell if anything -

01:09:03.171 --> 01:09:07.071
I know this all looks natural, but perhaps 
something is fashioned to look such.

01:09:07.071 --> 01:09:08.621
I want to see if I can figure that out.

01:09:08.621 --> 01:09:11.438
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and make an investigate check.

01:09:11.438 --> 01:09:15.207
LIAM: Uh, lalalala. 18.

01:09:15.207 --> 01:09:19.929
MATT: 18? Best that you can find, looking around,

01:09:21.889 --> 01:09:26.211
you cannot see anything before you, any sort of mechanism,

01:09:26.211 --> 01:09:29.539
any sort of any button, any sort of lever, or additional doorway.

01:09:29.539 --> 01:09:33.791
It's just a solid wall, with the two magma flows.

01:09:33.791 --> 01:09:35.966
LIAM: All right. I double back for the Underdark expert

01:09:35.966 --> 01:09:37.527
and I bring my sister up.

01:09:37.527 --> 01:09:39.297
LAURA: Right, right, right. Can I come up and look and

01:09:39.297 --> 01:09:41.739
see if I can see any tracking?

01:09:41.739 --> 01:09:44.186
If there's any footprints around a certain area around this.

01:09:44.186 --> 01:09:45.890
LIAM: See if you can find a false door or something.

01:09:45.890 --> 01:09:46.908
LAURA: Yeah.

01:09:46.908 --> 01:09:48.597
MATT: All right. Go ahead and make an investigate check.

01:09:48.597 --> 01:09:50.684
LIAM: Do it. Do it.

01:09:50.684 --> 01:09:52.121
MARISHA: Wait, I thought it was behind--

01:09:52.121 --> 01:09:53.098
LIAM: No!

01:09:53.098 --> 01:09:54.197
LAURA: It's okay, no, no, no! I get an advantage.

01:09:54.197 --> 01:09:54.797
LIAM: It was a 1.

01:09:54.797 --> 01:09:55.555
LAURA: Shush.

01:09:55.555 --> 01:09:56.921
LIAM: All right. That's not a 1.

01:09:56.921 --> 01:09:58.031
MARISHA: (laughs)
LAURA: Is it investigation?

01:09:58.031 --> 01:09:58.843
LIAM: Yes.

01:09:58.843 --> 01:10:00.505
LAURA: 22.

01:10:00.505 --> 01:10:06.573
MATT: Okay. Looking at this, the side of this fortress,

01:10:06.573 --> 01:10:12.554
you can see what amounts to a very, very slight raise

01:10:12.554 --> 01:10:16.674
in the smooth flow of magma. It seems to pour down

01:10:16.674 --> 01:10:20.203
most of the stronghold and then slightly bulge out,

01:10:20.203 --> 01:10:22.274
and then it pools, and you can now have a better,

01:10:22.274 --> 01:10:24.068
closer so you see where it runs off to.

01:10:24.068 --> 01:10:26.212
It continues into a stream following the edge

01:10:26.212 --> 01:10:28.893
of the giant cavern wall that's curving down

01:10:28.893 --> 01:10:33.209
and to the left into a far deeper cavern.

01:10:33.209 --> 01:10:35.970
You can see the entire cavern, almost like a giant U.

01:10:35.970 --> 01:10:38.393
It's open, and the entire thing banks around it and goes

01:10:38.393 --> 01:10:41.411
deeper still. You guys have made it to the far back wall.

01:10:41.411 --> 01:10:43.587
LAURA: (gasps, sighs)

01:10:43.587 --> 01:10:47.038
MATT: Ah, the chicken has arrived.

01:10:47.038 --> 01:10:48.485
SAM: (laughs) Metaphorically...

01:10:48.485 --> 01:10:50.246
MATT: Metaphorically, and actually.

01:10:50.246 --> 01:10:52.058
But from what you can see

01:10:52.058 --> 01:10:54.489
there is a slight raise beneath the magma.

01:10:54.489 --> 01:10:56.982
LAURA: Okay. Does it look like it's safe to bring

01:10:56.982 --> 01:11:02.101
everybody up here or does it seem like 
anything's around that could see us?

01:11:02.101 --> 01:11:03.654
Anything looking from above?

01:11:03.654 --> 01:11:06.108
MATT: You glance up and you can see there are two duergar

01:11:06.108 --> 01:11:09.560
perched up on the edge of the first floor, right on the parapet.

01:11:09.560 --> 01:11:12.472
You can see there's all this jagged, obsidian stone,

01:11:12.472 --> 01:11:17.173
almost teeth, sticking out of the very top edge of the wall.

01:11:17.173 --> 01:11:19.591
And you see the patrols just walking, keeping an eye out.

01:11:19.591 --> 01:11:22.477
They have crossbows on their arms.

01:11:22.477 --> 01:11:24.830
A couple of others just have javelins at the side.

01:11:24.830 --> 01:11:26.571
And they're just doing slow patrols.

01:11:26.571 --> 01:11:27.927
LAURA: Okay.

01:11:27.927 --> 01:11:30.203
SAM: We need to 007--

01:11:30.203 --> 01:11:31.527
LAURA: We're going to have to be super--

01:11:31.527 --> 01:11:32.949
SAM: We're going to have to 007 sniper them out.

01:11:32.949 --> 01:11:33.639
LAURA: Yeah.

01:11:33.639 --> 01:11:35.287
MARISHA: I can handle this, I think.

01:11:35.287 --> 01:11:36.698
LAURA: You can?

01:11:36.698 --> 01:11:39.064
MARISHA: I think I can get us into that trap door.

01:11:39.064 --> 01:11:40.888
SAM: I think you're right.

01:11:40.888 --> 01:11:42.456
LAURA: Do you have something that can 
pull it towards you?

01:11:42.456 --> 01:11:44.191
SAM: No no no, can you redirect the magma flow around

01:11:44.191 --> 01:11:47.910
that bulge with your - can't you, move rocks or--

01:11:47.910 --> 01:11:48.943
MARISHA: I can.

01:11:48.943 --> 01:11:51.263
SAM: So you can create a like a little lip for it to go around?

01:11:51.263 --> 01:11:52.490
LAURA: Ooh...

01:11:52.490 --> 01:11:55.259
MARISHA: I was thinking I could either do - 
that's not a bad idea, or I could -

01:11:55.259 --> 01:11:58.049
That's actually not a bad idea.

01:11:58.049 --> 01:12:00.274
(all laugh)

01:12:00.274 --> 01:12:02.592
MATT: (singing) That's fucking teamwork.

01:12:02.592 --> 01:12:03.822
(all laugh)

01:12:03.822 --> 01:12:06.030
MARISHA: Or I could, or I was thinking I could cool off

01:12:06.030 --> 01:12:09.217
the magma and we could break it.

01:12:09.217 --> 01:12:13.102
LAURA: Oh yeah, maybe you can move 
it away, and then cool it.

01:12:13.102 --> 01:12:14.476
LIAM: That sounds kind of noisy.

01:12:14.476 --> 01:12:15.600
MARISHA: Well...

01:12:15.600 --> 01:12:17.342
SAM: First we’ve got to take care of the guys on the roof.

01:12:17.342 --> 01:12:20.002
Are they back with us, or are they still stealthing in front?

01:12:20.002 --> 01:12:22.028
MATT: They're still stealthing in front, and you guys have

01:12:22.028 --> 01:12:23.335
come back to the group?

01:12:23.335 --> 01:12:24.421
LAURA: Yeah, I guess we came back to the group

01:12:24.421 --> 01:12:26.077
and told them about what's going on.

01:12:26.077 --> 01:12:30.697
SAM: Okay. We can - me and Pike - can take out 
the guys on the roof.

01:12:30.697 --> 01:12:31.863
LAURA: Oh really?

01:12:31.863 --> 01:12:33.228
TRAVIS: Yeah! Do it!
ASHLEY: You want to give it a go?

01:12:33.228 --> 01:12:34.301
LAURA: Wait, but he's got sneak attack.

01:12:34.301 --> 01:12:36.404
LIAM: Yeah, I'm thinking that Keyleth should--

01:12:36.404 --> 01:12:37.805
LAURA: Yeah but we could--

01:12:37.805 --> 01:12:38.809
SAM: Yeah, but they're a good 200 feet up.

01:12:38.809 --> 01:12:39.729
LIAM: --bird out and drop me.

01:12:39.729 --> 01:12:41.588
LAURA: If Keyleth can bird up or you could go over 
on the flying carpet or something.

01:12:41.588 --> 01:12:43.249
SAM: I can take Pike and we can do it.

01:12:43.249 --> 01:12:44.544
LAURA: Oh my god.

01:12:44.544 --> 01:12:45.692
(all laugh)

01:12:45.692 --> 01:12:46.894
MARISHA: Are they are they unable to be shot out?

01:12:46.894 --> 01:12:48.000
Can you not arrow them out?

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:49.314
LAURA: I can try to arrow them out too.

01:12:49.314 --> 01:12:50.363
MARISHA: How high are they?

01:12:50.363 --> 01:12:52.276
LIAM: She can get a hit or two, but 
the chances that she

01:12:52.276 --> 01:12:54.224
could take them both out at once...

01:12:54.224 --> 01:12:56.782
LAURA: Maybe you should go up and I'll 
arrow one and you...

01:12:56.782 --> 01:12:58.778
TRAVIS: Why don't you let the little 
people have some fun?

01:12:58.778 --> 01:13:00.817
MARISHA: I'm just afraid if you go up there, that you're 
going to alarm yourself to other people.

01:13:00.817 --> 01:13:05.613
TALIESIN: How loud is it down there? 
Is the lava flow making noise?

01:13:05.613 --> 01:13:08.923
MATT: Very subtle pops and hisses, but other 
than that it's pretty quiet.

01:13:08.923 --> 01:13:11.016
TALIESIN: Not like the roaring sound of a waterfall.

01:13:11.016 --> 01:13:14.147
MATT: No, no, it's a slow gradual pour.

01:13:14.898 --> 01:13:17.839
TALIESIN: Does anybody have a "mute" spell
of some kind?

01:13:17.839 --> 01:13:20.859
SAM: Mute, as in silence noise, or a person?

01:13:20.859 --> 01:13:22.549
LAURA: I mean, Pass Without Trace, there's silence?

01:13:22.549 --> 01:13:23.666
TALIESIN: Yes, as in silence noise.

01:13:23.666 --> 01:13:24.790
ASHLEY: Wait!

01:13:24.790 --> 01:13:25.951
SAM: No, not me.

01:13:25.951 --> 01:13:26.909
TALIESIN: Damn it.

01:13:26.909 --> 01:13:27.629
ASHLEY: I have - okay wait.

01:13:27.629 --> 01:13:29.868
MATT: David Norris? Thank you David Norris 
for the chicken!

01:13:29.868 --> 01:13:31.066
ALL: Thank you David Norris!

01:13:31.066 --> 01:13:31.827
LAURA: The chicken is delicious!

01:13:31.827 --> 01:13:32.677
ORION: I love chicken.

01:13:32.677 --> 01:13:33.885
LIAM: Dave, the illithids have it. Thank you, Dave.

01:13:33.885 --> 01:13:39.393
LAURA: I'm just not going to let you see me eat it.

01:13:39.393 --> 01:13:42.318
LIAM: Oh my god, her mouth opens up and 
tentacles come out and -

01:13:42.318 --> 01:13:44.317
ORION: It's really scary.

01:13:47.911 --> 01:13:49.407
MARISHA: Sorry, what are we doing?

01:13:49.407 --> 01:13:52.223
MATT: It's a good question. What are you doing?

01:13:52.223 --> 01:13:54.221
SAM: We gotta take out the fuckers on the roof.

01:13:54.221 --> 01:13:55.232
LAURA: Right.

01:13:55.232 --> 01:13:56.855
SAM: Do you want to try to shoot them out?

01:13:56.855 --> 01:13:59.181
Or do you want me to take Pike and fuck their shit up?

01:13:59.181 --> 01:14:00.176
TRAVIS: Do that.

01:14:00.176 --> 01:14:01.359
LAURA: I mean, if you can flip them off the roof

01:14:01.359 --> 01:14:02.391
that would be awesome.

01:14:02.391 --> 01:14:04.365
SAM: That's what we're going to do.
LAURA: Okay, then do it.

01:14:04.365 --> 01:14:06.581
LIAM: Wait, can we see anyone else?
ASHLEY: We're just going to fling them off of the roof?

01:14:06.581 --> 01:14:07.830
LIAM: Can I see duergar from any other perch?

01:14:07.830 --> 01:14:08.817
TRAVIS: Yep, pressure's on!

01:14:08.817 --> 01:14:10.599
MATT: From your current position, you're up 
against the wall, no.

01:14:10.599 --> 01:14:12.129
LIAM: No? All right.

01:14:12.129 --> 01:14:14.214
MATT: You can back away and take up 
more of a case on it if you want.

01:14:14.214 --> 01:14:15.794
MARISHA: I mean if I took eagle form I could drop you

01:14:15.794 --> 01:14:18.229
and then I could just pick one up with my eagle talons 
and in the lava they go.

01:14:18.229 --> 01:14:20.655
LIAM: This seems dangerous and reckless.

01:14:20.655 --> 01:14:22.737
MARISHA: It does seem very dangerous and reckless.

01:14:22.737 --> 01:14:24.106
LIAM: Let's do it?

01:14:24.106 --> 01:14:25.270
ASHLEY: What if it brings attention?

01:14:25.270 --> 01:14:26.738
LIAM: Who gives a shit?

01:14:26.738 --> 01:14:28.237
MARISHA: I'm keeping my Pass Without A Trace up.

01:14:28.237 --> 01:14:29.913
LAURA: We'll just have to be fast. Be really speedy.

01:14:29.913 --> 01:14:31.980
ORION: Can they see down to where we are? 
Does it just keep going?

01:14:31.980 --> 01:14:33.292
MARISHA: I'm going with you guys.

01:14:33.292 --> 01:14:35.315
TRAVIS: It's been over an hour, we've 
killed nothing, we'll kill these fucks!

01:14:35.315 --> 01:14:37.107
MATT: So far only the two of them have really 
approached the stronghold and you guys

01:14:37.107 --> 01:14:38.904
have stayed back behind the elevations.

01:14:38.904 --> 01:14:40.701
TRAVIS: I'm a vampire. I need blood.

01:14:40.701 --> 01:14:42.703
MATT: So you can all try, in theory, if you want 
to just stealth past them.

01:14:42.703 --> 01:14:44.043
MARISHA: Wait, what?

01:14:44.043 --> 01:14:44.978
SAM: Here's my plan.

01:14:44.978 --> 01:14:45.823
LAURA: Okay!

01:14:45.823 --> 01:14:46.834
ORION: We're not with them.

01:14:46.834 --> 01:14:48.029
MARISHA: Yeah we are, we are.

01:14:48.029 --> 01:14:50.074
SAM: I take Pike up there. We knock those 
fuckers off, super easy.

01:14:50.074 --> 01:14:50.820
TRAVIS: Yep.

01:14:50.820 --> 01:14:53.030
SAM: Grog runs out and brains them the second 
they hit the ground.

01:14:53.030 --> 01:14:54.758
TRAVIS: I approve of this plan.

01:14:54.758 --> 01:14:56.440
LIAM: Or fall in the lava. You just gotta shove them.

01:14:56.440 --> 01:14:57.894
LAURA: Yeah, they'll fall in the lava pit, 
just shove them off the side.

01:14:57.894 --> 01:14:59.171
SAM: Maybe. I don't know where they're going to fall.

01:14:59.171 --> 01:15:00.481
LAURA: Well, just do it.

01:15:00.481 --> 01:15:02.544
MARISHA: Well, if they miss they miss 
the lava pit, we've got Grog.

01:15:02.544 --> 01:15:04.222
ORION: Can I just say right now--

01:15:04.222 --> 01:15:06.270
LAURA: Just be ready to let us know if you need help.

01:15:06.270 --> 01:15:08.421
ORION: --I'm going to be reading this book.

01:15:08.421 --> 01:15:09.925
MARISHA: Eagle form.

01:15:09.925 --> 01:15:13.512
LIAM: I'm hanging by Keyleth in case shit goes south.
LAURA: Oh my god this is so stupid.

01:15:13.512 --> 01:15:14.773
LIAM: Then we're going up, right?

01:15:14.773 --> 01:15:15.971
MARISHA: Jump on my back.

01:15:15.971 --> 01:15:17.055
SAM: What you got, Pike?

01:15:17.055 --> 01:15:18.059
LIAM: Yeah, girl.

01:15:18.059 --> 01:15:19.310
LAURA: Give me the flying carpet just in case 
I need to fly.

01:15:19.310 --> 01:15:20.314
MARISHA: Or I can give you a ride.

01:15:20.314 --> 01:15:21.866
SAM: I can get you up there. What can you do 
when we're up there?

01:15:21.866 --> 01:15:23.272
ASHLEY: There's something I've been wanting to do.

01:15:23.272 --> 01:15:24.060
SAM: Yeah!

01:15:24.060 --> 01:15:25.145
TRAVIS: What do you say?

01:15:25.145 --> 01:15:26.121
ORION: Oh my word, this is fascinating!

01:15:26.121 --> 01:15:27.145
LAURA: We're doing it!

01:15:27.145 --> 01:15:28.388
TRAVIS: But what do you say to get the magic carpet?

01:15:28.388 --> 01:15:30.440
LAURA: Please can I have the magic carpet?

01:15:30.440 --> 01:15:34.745
SAM: I'm going to just look at the guard's 
pattern of movement.

01:15:34.745 --> 01:15:38.062
Are they staying in position, or are they walking around?

01:15:38.062 --> 01:15:39.982
Are they talking to each other at all?

01:15:39.982 --> 01:15:41.212
TRAVIS: Ooh, good question.

01:15:41.212 --> 01:15:44.284
MATT: As you watch, you take a moment, still from 
the far back position,

01:15:44.284 --> 01:15:48.535
watch the two up there come together; 
they chat for a second,

01:15:48.535 --> 01:15:50.219
then a third one appears.

01:15:50.219 --> 01:15:51.143
SAM: Oh shit.

01:15:51.143 --> 01:15:52.682
MATT: Then one of them rotates out

01:15:52.682 --> 01:15:53.991
for the one that just arrived.

01:15:53.991 --> 01:15:55.264
ASHLEY: They were switching shifts.

01:15:55.264 --> 01:15:56.566
MATT: They both just sit there, keeping an eye.

01:15:56.566 --> 01:15:57.374
One of them cleans his bow.

01:15:57.374 --> 01:15:58.404
SAM: Are they close to each other?

01:15:58.404 --> 01:15:59.795
MATT: They're about twenty feet from each other

01:15:59.795 --> 01:16:01.295
along the top of the parapet.

01:16:01.295 --> 01:16:02.940
TRAVIS: There's three? There's three, not two?

01:16:02.940 --> 01:16:04.001
SAM: You said twenty feet?

01:16:04.001 --> 01:16:04.725
MATT: Twenty feet, yes.

01:16:04.725 --> 01:16:06.183
TRAVIS: There's three up there?

01:16:06.183 --> 01:16:07.250
TALIESIN: Now there's three.

01:16:07.250 --> 01:16:08.127
MATT: Two.

01:16:08.127 --> 01:16:09.820
SAM: No no, one came to swap out the other.

01:16:09.820 --> 01:16:11.436
LAURA: Oh my gosh.

01:16:11.436 --> 01:16:13.042
TRAVIS: I’m just saying, I have been known to climb

01:16:13.042 --> 01:16:16.248
a few things in my time, if you need an extra.

01:16:16.248 --> 01:16:18.801
ASHLEY: All right, let's do it.

01:16:18.801 --> 01:16:20.842
MARISHA: Are you coming too, Pike?

01:16:20.842 --> 01:16:26.549
ASHLEY: Yeah! I'm a-coming up there 
to kill some - some things.

01:16:26.549 --> 01:16:29.359
(all laugh)

01:16:29.359 --> 01:16:31.001
TRAVIS: Do you have any climbing gear or anything?

01:16:31.001 --> 01:16:34.506
ASHLEY: I have a grappling hook.

01:16:34.506 --> 01:16:35.886
LIAM: The ocean has changed you.

01:16:35.886 --> 01:16:37.413
LAURA: Oh my god. This is stupid.

01:16:37.413 --> 01:16:40.288
SAM: Okay, they're standing twenty feet apart?

01:16:40.288 --> 01:16:41.397
MATT: Yeah.

01:16:41.397 --> 01:16:43.018
TALIESIN: I'm going to watch this all 
go down with Bad News.

01:16:43.018 --> 01:16:44.198
SAM: Radius? 15 feet?

01:16:44.198 --> 01:16:45.239
LAURA: Yeah, me and you get ready to shoot.

01:16:45.239 --> 01:16:46.922
TALIESIN: I'm waiting in case--

01:16:46.922 --> 01:16:48.274
SAM: Is the range a radius?

01:16:48.274 --> 01:16:49.714
MARISHA: So wait, who's all going?

01:16:49.714 --> 01:16:50.613
TRAVIS: Just those two.

01:16:50.613 --> 01:16:51.675
MATT: No, range is how far away from you they are,

01:16:51.675 --> 01:16:52.692
and the radius is for the point of the spell.

01:16:52.692 --> 01:16:54.171
SAM: No, I mean a range of a spell, is how far from me?

01:16:54.171 --> 01:16:55.477
MARISHA: Just those two?
TRAVIS: Scanlan and Pike.

01:16:55.477 --> 01:16:56.496
LAURA: And you're going to bring them up if you can.

01:16:56.496 --> 01:16:57.249
MATT: Yes.

01:16:57.249 --> 01:16:58.383
SAM: Got it. We're good.

01:16:58.383 --> 01:16:59.539
LIAM: Are they carpeting up? How are you going up?

01:16:59.539 --> 01:17:00.301
MARISHA: Are you guys going to fly on me?

01:17:00.301 --> 01:17:01.538
LAURA: They'll fly on Keyleth.

01:17:01.538 --> 01:17:02.966
LIAM: Scanlan, how are you guys going up? 
Eagle? Carpet?

01:17:02.966 --> 01:17:04.424
SAM: No.

01:17:04.424 --> 01:17:05.323
LAURA: Eagle.

01:17:05.323 --> 01:17:06.187
LIAM: What?

01:17:06.187 --> 01:17:07.278
TRAVIS: You're climbing that shit, aren't you?

01:17:07.278 --> 01:17:08.722
SAM: I can get there like that. We're good.

01:17:08.722 --> 01:17:09.616
TRAVIS: Cliffhanger. Beautiful.

01:17:09.616 --> 01:17:10.551
LIAM: Do it, Tom Cruise.

01:17:10.551 --> 01:17:11.909
LAURA: All right, do it. Mission Impossible.

01:17:11.909 --> 01:17:13.809
SAM: All right. You ready? Do you know what you're 
going to do up there?

01:17:13.809 --> 01:17:16.041
ASHLEY: Not really, but let's just wing it!

01:17:16.041 --> 01:17:18.815
SAM: I'm going to try to knock them 
both off in one blow,

01:17:18.815 --> 01:17:21.055
but if I miss, you gotta take one.

01:17:21.055 --> 01:17:22.117
LAURA: You can charge them off if you want.

01:17:22.117 --> 01:17:23.365
ASHLEY: Okay. all right. I can take one 
if you can take one.

01:17:23.365 --> 01:17:24.327
TRAVIS: You’ve got a morningstar.

01:17:24.327 --> 01:17:25.089
SAM: Okay.

01:17:25.089 --> 01:17:26.057
ASHLEY: All right.

01:17:26.057 --> 01:17:26.848
TRAVIS: Morningstar to the taint.

01:17:26.848 --> 01:17:27.642
SAM: Grog, you ready to kill?

01:17:27.642 --> 01:17:28.386
TRAVIS: Yeah, oh yeah!

01:17:28.386 --> 01:17:30.284
LAURA: Be really quiet while you're fighting, 
try to take them out before they--

01:17:30.284 --> 01:17:31.374
TALIESIN: This is awesome and nothing 
is going to go wrong.

01:17:31.374 --> 01:17:32.928
MARISHA: Why are we using the gnomes 
to throw people over?

01:17:32.928 --> 01:17:34.358
ORION: I can't believe how they wrote this.

01:17:34.358 --> 01:17:35.786
SAM: We’re little people! You know why?

01:17:35.786 --> 01:17:38.053
Because I need someone with me 
and I can only take her,

01:17:38.053 --> 01:17:42.429
because that's the only other one who will fit 
through the Dimension Door with me.

01:17:42.429 --> 01:17:43.664
LAURA: Go!

01:17:43.664 --> 01:17:44.645
ASHLEY: The Dimension Door?

01:17:44.645 --> 01:17:46.362
SAM: Yes, we're going to go through a Dimension Door.

01:17:46.362 --> 01:17:49.030
I can take one person of my height or smaller.

01:17:49.030 --> 01:17:50.160
MATT: All right.

01:17:50.160 --> 01:17:51.157
SAM: So I will take Pike.

01:17:51.157 --> 01:17:52.167
LIAM: Portal, motherfucker!

01:17:52.167 --> 01:17:55.183
MATT: You reach over and hold on to Pike gently, 
give her a little wink. And suddenly--

01:17:55.183 --> 01:17:57.798
SAM: We're going to try to appear between the two of them.

01:17:57.798 --> 01:18:00.443
Exactly between the two of them.

01:18:00.443 --> 01:18:05.475
MATT: Okay. You feel the sudden rush of air and 
the surrounding atmosphere of you goes from

01:18:05.475 --> 01:18:09.664
that uncomfortable warmth to a sudden freezing cold 
as your vision goes black and all you can see

01:18:09.664 --> 01:18:14.556
is Scanlan looking at you with this heightened grin 
as he's muttering these arcane incantations under his breath.

01:18:14.556 --> 01:18:18.953
An instant later, you guys are both standing at the top 
of the wall, with both of the duergar,

01:18:18.953 --> 01:18:23.819
one kind of facing away, one looking really surprised 
at the fact that you guys both appeared there.

01:18:23.819 --> 01:18:25.344
You have a surprise round. What are you doing?

01:18:25.344 --> 01:18:28.180
SAM: I cast Thunderwave and blast out from where

01:18:28.180 --> 01:18:31.558
I'm standing between them, 15 feet in either direction.

01:18:31.558 --> 01:18:32.823
LAURA: (whispering) That's so loud!

01:18:32.823 --> 01:18:33.744
MARISHA: Isn't that loud?

01:18:33.744 --> 01:18:35.165
SAM: So, 10 feet and 10 feet away from me.

01:18:35.165 --> 01:18:36.770
MATT: Okay. What's your save?

01:18:36.770 --> 01:18:38.548
SAM: Uh, 19.

01:18:38.548 --> 01:18:39.796
LIAM: But a quiet Thunderwave, right?

01:18:39.796 --> 01:18:40.728
MATT: 19, all right.

01:18:40.728 --> 01:18:41.685
LAURA: A really quiet Thunderwave.

01:18:41.685 --> 01:18:42.957
ORION: Thunderclap is loud. Thunderwave is different.

01:18:42.957 --> 01:18:44.287
LAURA: Oh, okay.

01:18:44.287 --> 01:18:47.900
MARISHA: But I'm pretty sure it's still thunder.

01:18:47.900 --> 01:18:51.625
MATT: Thunderwave, looking it up real fast just to 
make sure of the situation.

01:18:51.625 --> 01:18:52.746
TRAVIS: I like this plan.

01:18:52.746 --> 01:18:54.106
ORION: Thunder makes a noise right?

01:18:54.106 --> 01:18:55.514
LIAM: (singing) This is a triumph.

01:18:55.514 --> 01:18:56.910
ASHLEY: (singing) I'm making a note here.

01:18:56.910 --> 01:18:58.431
SEVERAL: (singing) Huge success.

01:18:58.431 --> 01:18:59.844
(all laugh)

01:18:59.844 --> 01:19:01.079
MATT: Here we go.

01:19:01.079 --> 01:19:02.276
SAM: I don't think it's loud.

01:19:02.276 --> 01:19:04.062
LIAM: We're total fake geeks, all of us.

01:19:04.062 --> 01:19:05.085
(all laugh)

01:19:05.085 --> 01:19:06.288
TALIESIN: Such fake geeks.

01:19:06.288 --> 01:19:09.744
SAM: Oh no - well, it's a wave of thunderous force,

01:19:09.744 --> 01:19:12.435
but it doesn't say sound.
It just says thunderous force.

01:19:12.435 --> 01:19:15.661
MATT: I would say thunderous force isn't 
a thunderclap,but it will make some noise.

01:19:15.661 --> 01:19:16.475
SAM: Okay, fine.

01:19:16.475 --> 01:19:17.744
MATT: So keep that in mind.

01:19:17.744 --> 01:19:19.585
LAURA: Keyleth, fly up and cast Pass Without Trace 
on them.

01:19:19.585 --> 01:19:22.639
MATT: So, as you guys appear, you release Pike, 
you bring your arms up and slam your arms

01:19:22.639 --> 01:19:28.730
in a downward motion. As you do, there is 
a dull flash of light and a (boom noise)

01:19:28.730 --> 01:19:30.715
burst sound emanates from you.

01:19:30.715 --> 01:19:31.966
ORION: I say, “Ooh, light.”

01:19:31.966 --> 01:19:34.673
MATT: Both of the duergar, the one who sees you,

01:19:34.673 --> 01:19:36.346
who is bringing us his crossbow to fire,

01:19:36.346 --> 01:19:39.469
gets impacted and blown off the side of the wall.

01:19:39.469 --> 01:19:42.106
The one facing away gets blown up towards,

01:19:42.106 --> 01:19:44.559
slams into the side of the wall, right at the edge,

01:19:44.559 --> 01:19:47.594
and then topples over the side, both plummeting over.

01:19:47.594 --> 01:19:49.138
LIAM: Wilhelm scream!

01:19:49.138 --> 01:19:50.609
ASHLEY: Oh!

01:19:50.609 --> 01:19:52.463
MATT: Brief Wilhelm scream. You're standing there, 
you watch this happen.

01:19:52.463 --> 01:19:54.246
ASHLEY: I didn't have to do anything, Scanlan!

01:19:54.246 --> 01:19:55.596
SAM: Make out with me!

01:19:55.596 --> 01:19:57.617
(all laugh)

01:19:57.617 --> 01:20:01.228
SAM: We’re alone, it’s super romantic. 
I just killed two fuckers!

01:20:01.228 --> 01:20:03.874
Come on! It’s now or never, baby!

01:20:03.874 --> 01:20:05.072
TRAVIS: (singing) I think we’re alone now!

01:20:05.072 --> 01:20:07.041
ASHLEY &amp;amp; TRAVIS: (singing) Doesn’t seem to be anyone around!

01:20:07.041 --> 01:20:08.874
(all laugh)

01:20:08.874 --> 01:20:10.841
ASHLEY: Well, let’s just wait until we’re out of danger.

01:20:10.841 --> 01:20:12.532
MARISHA: Yeah, it’s getting real romantic real quick, Scanlan.

01:20:12.532 --> 01:20:13.606
SAM: Wait? 
ASHLEY: But that was really hot!

01:20:13.606 --> 01:20:14.663
SAM: It was really hot, right? Come on!
ASHLEY: It was.

01:20:14.663 --> 01:20:16.163
SAM: Just a little something something?

01:20:16.163 --> 01:20:17.036
ASHLEY: Let’s just--

01:20:17.036 --> 01:20:17.927
MARISHA: So sexy.

01:20:17.927 --> 01:20:21.714
MATT: As this is happening, both of the duergar come 
plummeting off the side of the wall.

01:20:21.714 --> 01:20:22.966
LIAM: Friendzoned.

01:20:22.966 --> 01:20:28.936
MATT: One manages to kind of loosely break his fall 
but the full 25 foot fall - he takes--

01:20:28.936 --> 01:20:30.109
LAURA: Get ready.

01:20:30.109 --> 01:20:31.057
LIAM: Come on, Grog.

01:20:31.057 --> 01:20:32.016
TRAVIS: I rage!

01:20:32.016 --> 01:20:33.143
(all laugh)

01:20:33.143 --> 01:20:38.823
MATT: There’s one that lands just to the side of the 
magma pool that’s forming.

01:20:38.823 --> 01:20:43.442
He took some damage and is like (pained gasps) 
trying to get back up. He fell hard on one arm.

01:20:43.442 --> 01:20:48.316
The other one that’s further away from the magma, 
the one that saw you, managed to reduce his damage

01:20:48.316 --> 01:20:50.626
a little bit because it was aware at least you were there.

01:20:50.626 --> 01:20:51.981
SAM: We have to kill these fuckers.

01:20:51.981 --> 01:20:54.791
MATT: Looks like it took some damage, but not too much. 
It’s maybe 10 feet from you.

01:20:54.791 --> 01:20:57.097
TRAVIS: (eager laugh)

01:20:57.097 --> 01:21:01.311
MATT: As he’s trying to get back up, he looks up and sees you
charging towards him, Grog, raging.

01:21:01.311 --> 01:21:02.739
Go ahead and make your two attacks.

01:21:02.739 --> 01:21:03.617
LAURA: Yes!

01:21:03.617 --> 01:21:08.677
TRAVIS: (roars) 19.

01:21:08.677 --> 01:21:10.370
MATT: 19 hits.

01:21:10.370 --> 01:21:12.418
TRAVIS: Nice. And 19 again!

01:21:12.418 --> 01:21:13.994
MATT: Both hit. Go ahead and roll damage.

01:21:13.994 --> 01:21:16.613
LIAM: I’m going to get some duergar!

01:21:18.743 --> 01:21:22.387
TRAVIS: 17 and 19.

01:21:22.387 --> 01:21:25.144
MATT: So as he gets up, (grunt) he goes back for 
his warhammer.

01:21:25.144 --> 01:21:27.652
Before he gets a chance to, you cleave off one arm

01:21:27.652 --> 01:21:30.555
and send the axe right into the center of his torso,

01:21:30.555 --> 01:21:32.087
silencing him in an instant.

01:21:32.087 --> 01:21:34.997
He slightly spreads at the wound. (choking sound)

01:21:34.997 --> 01:21:37.738
This gurgling sound, and you just have to kick him 
off the edge of your axe.

01:21:37.738 --> 01:21:40.927
TRAVIS: I tilt him towards the pillar to spray 
the pillar with his gore.

01:21:40.927 --> 01:21:42.896
Look, I can make one too! Ha ha!

01:21:42.896 --> 01:21:44.498
(all laugh)

01:21:44.498 --> 01:21:49.583
MARISHA: I run across to the other one and Thorn Whip 
him from across the lava pool.

01:21:49.583 --> 01:21:53.219
MATT: You have to jump over the lava to do that because 
he’s on the side you guys are on.

01:21:53.219 --> 01:21:55.904
MARISHA: Oh. Well then, is there anyone on the other side?

01:21:55.904 --> 01:21:57.782
ASHLEY: Is he already dying, or no? He’s in the lava?

01:21:57.782 --> 01:21:58.923
MARISHA: He’s on the same side as me?

01:21:58.923 --> 01:22:00.379
MATT: He’s on the same side as you.
SAM: He’s hurt.

01:22:00.379 --> 01:22:02.001
LAURA: We run up and kick him into the lava!
MARISHA: Is he standing up or...yeah!

01:22:02.001 --> 01:22:03.766
MATT: He’s in the process of standing up, yeah.
LAURA: Can we just run up and kick him into the lava?

01:22:03.766 --> 01:22:05.446
MARISHA: Yeah, can I just run and push?

01:22:05.446 --> 01:22:07.363
MATT: (laughs) Okay, all right, so…

01:22:07.363 --> 01:22:08.835
LIAM: I use pushing attack!

01:22:08.835 --> 01:22:10.250
TRAVIS: (grunts) Hunh!
MARISHA: (grunts) Hunh!

01:22:10.250 --> 01:22:11.547
SAM: (high voice) I’m sorry!

01:22:11.547 --> 01:22:12.691
MARISHA: (laughing) Yes, exactly!

01:22:12.691 --> 01:22:13.589
(all laugh)

01:22:13.589 --> 01:22:14.886
MATT: All right, so go ahead and roll athletics.

01:22:14.886 --> 01:22:16.103
MARISHA: This is the meanest thing I’ve ever done!

01:22:16.103 --> 01:22:17.248
LIAM &amp;amp; MATT: (laugh)

01:22:17.248 --> 01:22:19.128
LAURA: No, no, remember you killed that kid one time.

01:22:19.128 --> 01:22:21.491
MARISHA: Oh, thanks for bringing that up, Vax!

01:22:21.491 --> 01:22:22.532
(all laugh)

01:22:22.532 --> 01:22:23.941
LAURA: I’m Vex, he’s Vax!

01:22:23.941 --> 01:22:25.505
TRAVIS: That’s some dark shit! That’s some dark shit!

01:22:25.505 --> 01:22:27.826
MARISHA: Oh, I thought it was Vex and Vax. 
Every time I get confused.

01:22:27.826 --> 01:22:29.409
MATT: (laughing) It’s a long story!

01:22:29.409 --> 01:22:30.686
ASHLEY: Oh my god. Remember you killed 
that kid one time?

01:22:30.686 --> 01:22:33.103
LIAM: Two and a half years in and Keyleth 
has just learned our names.

01:22:33.103 --> 01:22:35.091
MARISHA: I get them confused.

01:22:35.091 --> 01:22:36.588
SAM: I do too. All the time.

01:22:36.588 --> 01:22:37.677
SEVERAL: All the time.

01:22:37.677 --> 01:22:38.846
MARISHA: See, no one else has any idea!

01:22:38.846 --> 01:22:39.891
ORION: I have your names written down!

01:22:39.891 --> 01:22:41.895
LIAM: I’m Vex, okay? It’s simple!

01:22:41.895 --> 01:22:43.086
SAM: No, no! That is not true!

01:22:43.086 --> 01:22:44.419
LAURA: No, no, don’t do that. He’s lying.

01:22:44.419 --> 01:22:46.218
MARISHA: (laughing) Two years, and I just don’t.

01:22:46.218 --> 01:22:49.610
MATT: So, as the terrible blood spray occurs across the

01:22:49.610 --> 01:22:52.276
nearby pillar on Grog’s side, the other duergar is getting up

01:22:52.276 --> 01:22:57.120
with his crossbow, trying to get it ready. 
You rush forward.

01:22:57.120 --> 01:22:58.628
Go ahead and roll athletics.

01:22:58.628 --> 01:22:59.906
MARISHA: Oh!

01:22:59.906 --> 01:23:00.746
ASHLEY: Come on!

01:23:00.746 --> 01:23:01.755
LAURA: Oh no!

01:23:01.755 --> 01:23:03.608
ORION: As she does this, I notice 
everything, and I sit down.

01:23:03.608 --> 01:23:05.197
MARISHA: This is for that kid!

01:23:05.197 --> 01:23:06.253
ORION: And turn to the next chapter in my book.

01:23:06.253 --> 01:23:07.068
MATT: Okay.

01:23:07.068 --> 01:23:08.486
LIAM: (singing) He had it coming, he had it coming.

01:23:08.486 --> 01:23:10.512
ASHLEY: This is quite a good read!

01:23:10.512 --> 01:23:12.891
MARISHA: It could be worse. 14.

01:23:12.891 --> 01:23:15.051
MATT: That’s okay. He rolled a 1.

01:23:15.051 --> 01:23:17.152
LAURA: Ooh! Yes!

01:23:17.152 --> 01:23:18.649
MATT: So, as the duergar is getting up, he goes - (grunt)

01:23:18.649 --> 01:23:19.850
You just run up and - boom!

01:23:19.850 --> 01:23:23.034
And he falls back - (hissing SFX) (screams)

01:23:23.034 --> 01:23:29.375
- and starts giving a horrible, painful scream as he’s 
essentially flailing in the magma, melting.

01:23:29.375 --> 01:23:30.680
ASHLEY: Someone shoot him in the mouth.

01:23:30.680 --> 01:23:38.974
MARISHA: I say, shh! Shh! Shh! And I wind down 
to push him under the lava!

01:23:38.974 --> 01:23:41.147
ASHLEY: Oh, this is brutal!

01:23:41.147 --> 01:23:42.651
ORION: That’s not what it’s called.

01:23:42.651 --> 01:23:45.745
MATT: Okay. So, as he’s screaming your Wind Wall shoves 
him further under the magma as he’s screaming,

01:23:45.745 --> 01:23:49.219
cooling the magma around him as the rock (cracking SFX) 
cracks around him, turning into black rock--

01:23:49.219 --> 01:23:50.489
MARISHA: I’m sorry! I’m sorry!

01:23:50.489 --> 01:23:53.921
MATT: --his face still visible over the surface, 
going (choking SFX)

01:23:53.921 --> 01:23:57.408
in this horrible, almost Han-in-carbonite type of look 
at the top of the magma pool.

01:23:57.408 --> 01:23:58.449
LAURA: Keyleth!

01:23:58.449 --> 01:24:00.012
LIAM: You just one-upped Grog, man.

01:24:00.012 --> 01:24:01.527
TRAVIS: That was awesome!

01:24:01.527 --> 01:24:06.519
MATT: As fresh magma now begins to pool over the cool, 
covering his face, you step away.

01:24:06.519 --> 01:24:08.012
SAM: Piss on the body!

01:24:08.012 --> 01:24:10.136
TRAVIS: I never knew you were an artist.

01:24:10.136 --> 01:24:12.196
MARISHA: (laughs nervously)

01:24:12.196 --> 01:24:16.717
MATT: However, the subtle sound of the Thunderwave 
and then the horrible screams of pain,

01:24:16.717 --> 01:24:20.146
you can hear footsteps coming toward the wall edge 
where both you and Pike are currently on.

01:24:20.146 --> 01:24:21.335
What are you going to do?

01:24:21.335 --> 01:24:22.650
LAURA: Run! Or can you turn yourselves into duergar?

01:24:22.650 --> 01:24:23.618
SAM: Is there a door or something?

01:24:23.618 --> 01:24:24.922
MATT: Not from your current position, no.

01:24:24.922 --> 01:24:29.594
You’re just on a five foot ledge of the second story.

01:24:29.594 --> 01:24:33.480
SAM: Of the fortress. Oh, it’s not a standalone 
tower. It’s part of a larger wall.

01:24:33.480 --> 01:24:36.160
ASHLEY: How far of a jump down is it?

01:24:36.160 --> 01:24:37.699
MATT: It’s about 25 feet.

01:24:37.699 --> 01:24:39.372
LAURA: What, am I too excited about it?

01:24:39.372 --> 01:24:41.873
Turn yourself into a duergar! Make it seem 
like everything’s okay!

01:24:41.873 --> 01:24:43.243
ASHLEY: Should we call Grog?

01:24:43.243 --> 01:24:44.310
SAM: No, I’ll do the same thing to get us down.

01:24:44.310 --> 01:24:45.158
ASHLEY: Oh yeah, Dimension Door!

01:24:45.158 --> 01:24:46.080
SAM: Unless you want to stay and fight.

01:24:46.080 --> 01:24:46.887
MATT: You’ve got 20 seconds.

01:24:46.887 --> 01:24:47.882
MARISHA: Wait, what’s happening?

01:24:47.882 --> 01:24:48.998
ASHLEY: We could try to stay and fight?

01:24:48.998 --> 01:24:49.970
LIAM: Turn into a duergar! (cawing sounds)

01:24:49.970 --> 01:24:52.991
LAURA: Turn into a duergar! Act like you’re a duergar! 
Say everything’s okay!

01:24:52.991 --> 01:24:54.169
ASHLEY: Turn into a duergar?

01:24:54.169 --> 01:24:55.160
SAM: Should we get out of here?

01:24:55.160 --> 01:24:56.091
ASHLEY: Yeah, let’s get out.

01:24:56.091 --> 01:24:57.146
SAM: Okay, we’re going to Dimension Door out.

01:24:57.146 --> 01:25:00.812
MATT: Okay. So you grab her, (magic SFX) 
back down to the bottom.

01:25:00.812 --> 01:25:01.913
TRAVIS: Cast that shit.

01:25:01.913 --> 01:25:05.166
MATT: They reappear at the bottom.

01:25:05.166 --> 01:25:06.738
ORION: Are you done?

01:25:06.738 --> 01:25:14.433
MARISHA: Okay, I cast Wall of Stone, but right 
over top of where I see that lip.

01:25:14.433 --> 01:25:19.984
But I don't want to bring it out far. Just like, halfsies.

01:25:19.984 --> 01:25:21.458
SAM: (laughs) Just the tip.

01:25:21.458 --> 01:25:22.786
MARISHA: Just the tip.

01:25:22.786 --> 01:25:23.957
ASHLEY: Does it stop the magma?

01:25:23.957 --> 01:25:25.360
MATT: As you guys appear at the bottom--

01:25:25.360 --> 01:25:28.028
MARISHA: So it goes like magma flow, here's the wall, 
I want it to go - (grinding noise)

01:25:28.028 --> 01:25:32.389
MATT: --you guys hear footprints along the wall. 
They don't seem to have seen you yet.

01:25:32.389 --> 01:25:36.344
At which point there's this (grinding and thump sounds)
sound of shifting rock.

01:25:36.344 --> 01:25:42.936
A giant stone wall juts out the side of the fortress 
right where the lava pool was pouring over the side.

01:25:42.936 --> 01:25:48.179
As it does, the lava pools on top of the wall 
and is offset, leaving a small gap

01:25:48.179 --> 01:25:50.164
where you guys can try to squeeze through.

01:25:50.164 --> 01:25:54.507
You can see, right underneath where it was, 
there is a stone doorway.

01:25:54.507 --> 01:25:58.793
It does not appear to have a handle or anything, 
it's just a stone door.

01:25:58.793 --> 01:26:00.334
SAM: How do we get in?

01:26:00.334 --> 01:26:01.637
LIAM: Tiberius, fly up there quick.

01:26:01.637 --> 01:26:02.707
ORION: What?

01:26:02.707 --> 01:26:04.532
LIAM: Stop eating chicken and fly up to that door.

01:26:04.532 --> 01:26:05.729
ORION: Oh.

01:26:05.729 --> 01:26:08.541
ASHLEY: Where did you get that chicken?

01:26:08.541 --> 01:26:10.211
ORION: What's going on?

01:26:10.211 --> 01:26:13.282
LIAM: There's a magic doorway up there, I don't see 
any handles or anything.

01:26:13.282 --> 01:26:15.335
MATT: It's right underneath the lava.

01:26:15.335 --> 01:26:16.518
LIAM: Oh, it’s on the ground?

01:26:16.518 --> 01:26:19.200
MATT: Basically she put the stone
wall out. It pours off.

01:26:19.200 --> 01:26:20.577
ORION: It's right there! What are you talking about?

01:26:20.577 --> 01:26:22.323
LIAM: I walk up to it and take a look.

01:26:22.323 --> 01:26:24.449
LAURA: Oh yeah, that was good. Maybe Grog can push it!

01:26:24.449 --> 01:26:25.902
ORION: I'm going to do an Arcana check.

01:26:25.902 --> 01:26:26.923
LIAM: Do I have advantage?

01:26:26.923 --> 01:26:27.891
MATT: Uh, no.

01:26:27.891 --> 01:26:28.999
LAURA: Can Grog push it?

01:26:28.999 --> 01:26:29.928
LIAM: All right, take a look, dude.

01:26:29.928 --> 01:26:30.694
TRAVIS: No, he's doing an arcana check.

01:26:30.694 --> 01:26:32.065
SAM: Grog, just kill it!

01:26:32.065 --> 01:26:33.533
MARISHA: (laughing) Go kill it, just punch the door!

01:26:33.533 --> 01:26:34.839
ORION: 22.

01:26:34.839 --> 01:26:39.479
MATT: 22? As you guys are inspecting this, 
in the time you've taken to do this,

01:26:39.479 --> 01:26:45.239
both the duergar up on top have seen you, 
and are both taking shots at you.

01:26:45.239 --> 01:26:47.113
SAM: Oh shit.

01:26:47.113 --> 01:26:49.356
TALIESIN: I was waiting for that anyways 
so, I'm going to--

01:26:49.356 --> 01:26:50.868
MARISHA: He was waiting.

01:26:50.868 --> 01:26:54.478
MATT: As they appear on the top, you guys who have 
your arrow and gun at the ready,

01:26:54.478 --> 01:26:56.386
both take a shot then they get a retribution shot.

01:26:56.386 --> 01:26:57.455
LIAM: Keyleth!

01:26:57.455 --> 01:26:58.269
MARISHA: What?

01:26:58.269 --> 01:26:59.017
LIAM: Let's go up!

01:26:59.017 --> 01:26:59.615
MARISHA: Go up?

01:26:59.615 --> 01:27:00.754
LIAM: Up to them, quick.

01:27:00.754 --> 01:27:02.071
MARISHA: I want see how they fare.

01:27:02.071 --> 01:27:03.386
LIAM: That’s going to be about 6 seconds.

01:27:03.386 --> 01:27:05.427
MATT: The door is not magical. It is a
mechanism of some kind.

01:27:05.427 --> 01:27:06.817
LAURA: 65. Oh, 65? (laughter) Shit.

01:27:06.817 --> 01:27:07.958
SAM: I rolled a 65.

01:27:07.958 --> 01:27:09.098
LIAM: 65? Holy shit you're a deity!

01:27:09.098 --> 01:27:10.546
LAURA: I'm amazing!

01:27:12.099 --> 01:27:15.556
ORION: Vax. Pay attention, the door mechanical, 
it is not magical. That's how we open it.

01:27:15.556 --> 01:27:16.413
LAURA: 25.

01:27:16.413 --> 01:27:19.484
MATT: 25. Percy? And you get 2 attacks each. 
So - (zipping SFX)

01:27:19.484 --> 01:27:22.915
TALIESIN: I hit a 23.

01:27:22.915 --> 01:27:24.767
MATT: 23 hits. Go ahead and roll second attack.

01:27:24.767 --> 01:27:27.568
TALIESIN: Okay, roll damage.

01:27:27.568 --> 01:27:29.331
MATT: Well, roll both attacks first.

01:27:29.331 --> 01:27:30.571
LAURA: 18 for the second one.

01:27:30.571 --> 01:27:31.582
MATT: Hits as well.

01:27:31.582 --> 01:27:33.361
TALIESIN: I have to reload with my second attack.

01:27:33.361 --> 01:27:35.617
MATT: Oh right. Is this with the Bad News?

01:27:35.617 --> 01:27:36.825
TALIESIN: I've got the big gun out.

01:27:36.825 --> 01:27:39.182
MATT: You’ve got the Bad News out. Okay then, 
yeah. So you fire and then reload.

01:27:39.182 --> 01:27:42.913
Go ahead and roll damage.

01:27:42.913 --> 01:27:45.392
LAURA: I'm using my fire bow.

01:27:45.392 --> 01:27:48.696
MATT: You're using the fire bowstring. As you nock 
your first arrow, (swoosh sound) it bursts into flame

01:27:48.696 --> 01:27:50.336
as it hits your fingers.

01:27:50.336 --> 01:27:51.324
TALIESIN: Oh my god.

01:27:51.324 --> 01:27:53.030
MARISHA: (dejected groan)

01:27:53.030 --> 01:27:54.303
TALIESIN: 7 damage.

01:27:54.303 --> 01:27:55.826
MATT: 7 damage? Okay.

01:27:55.826 --> 01:27:57.540
TALIESIN: I'm so embarrassed.

01:27:57.540 --> 01:27:58.953
MATT: I'm sorry.

01:27:58.953 --> 01:28:00.403
LIAM: (gunshot sound) You got me right in the ear.

01:28:00.403 --> 01:28:01.643
LAURA: 20 damage on the first attack.

01:28:01.643 --> 01:28:03.252
MATT: Okay.

01:28:05.196 --> 01:28:06.836
MARISHA: Come on, Vex.

01:28:06.836 --> 01:28:08.632
LAURA: 13 on the second.

01:28:08.632 --> 01:28:16.033
MATT: Okay, as both are going up with their crossbows 
ready to go, first one, Bad News - (gunshot sound) -

01:28:16.033 --> 01:28:19.170
with a cacophonous echoing gunshot 
that within this cavern,

01:28:19.170 --> 01:28:22.247
definitely carries some sound to it.

01:28:22.247 --> 01:28:28.431
And to some degree, suprise may be a 
little harder to find going forward.

01:28:28.431 --> 01:28:32.210
TALIESIN: They were ready to start shooting at us.

01:28:32.210 --> 01:28:36.399
MATT: However, the shot hits the guy in the shoulder,
knocks him off balance for a second.

01:28:36.399 --> 01:28:39.747
Not enough of a wound to prevent his next action.

01:28:39.747 --> 01:28:43.097
You, however, place one arrow into 
the other guy’s shoulder.

01:28:43.097 --> 01:28:49.095
He's dropped the crossbow. As he goes to reach for his 
other weapon, the other one just,

01:28:49.095 --> 01:28:51.821
right at the bottom of his throat, out the back of his head,
and he just drops below the wall.

01:28:51.821 --> 01:28:53.301
ASHLEY: Awesome.

01:28:53.301 --> 01:28:57.175
MATT: The other one does get a crossbow 
shot off at you, Percy.

01:28:57.175 --> 01:29:00.292
That is a 23 versus armor class.

01:29:00.292 --> 01:29:01.821
TALIESIN: That hits.

01:29:01.835 --> 01:29:04.256
MATT: You take 9 points of piercing damage.

01:29:04.256 --> 01:29:07.516
As the bolt just streaks you across 
the front of your torso.

01:29:07.516 --> 01:29:09.695
Passes through, thankfully, but you do feel there is

01:29:09.695 --> 01:29:12.006
a wound that’s slowly turning warmer

01:29:12.006 --> 01:29:13.159
beneath your armor.

01:29:13.159 --> 01:29:15.283
LAURA: Can I shoot at the other one?

01:29:15.283 --> 01:29:16.411
MATT: That's been the round.

01:29:16.411 --> 01:29:18.577
Now, you guys have been inspecting the door.

01:29:18.577 --> 01:29:21.789
The door is not magical. There is some sort of contraption 
that opens it from the inside.

01:29:21.789 --> 01:29:25.497
LIAM: I’m getting my picks out, seeing if I 
can figure out some way to--

01:29:25.497 --> 01:29:29.369
MATT: Go ahead and make a check with your thieves’ tools.

01:29:31.194 --> 01:29:32.504
LIAM: 29.

01:29:32.504 --> 01:29:36.846
MATT: A 29. You take a second and you find that the contraption

01:29:36.846 --> 01:29:40.652
that holds this door in place definitely is on the other side. 
It's a series of winches and a chain pull.

01:29:40.652 --> 01:29:45.368
You find that there is one slight gap where you manage 
to hook one of the chains, pull it out ever so slightly,

01:29:45.368 --> 01:29:47.768
and you know with a strong yank from a strong person,

01:29:47.768 --> 01:29:51.168
you could probably pull it out from the outside.

01:29:51.168 --> 01:29:53.175
ORION: Grog!
TRAVIS: Sounds like we need a strong person.

01:29:53.175 --> 01:29:54.822
LIAM: So this is the part where I ask Grog over to pull.

01:29:54.822 --> 01:29:56.064
Grog, grab this--

01:29:56.064 --> 01:29:57.672
ASHLEY: I'll do it! I'll do it.

01:29:57.672 --> 01:29:59.693
(all laugh)

01:29:59.693 --> 01:30:03.180
TRAVIS: Yeah, me and Pike are on this.

01:30:03.180 --> 01:30:04.599
ASHLEY: I'll assist.

01:30:04.599 --> 01:30:07.909
MATT: Grog, you reach over and grab the chain, and Pike 
grabs onto the back of you and you both pull.

01:30:07.909 --> 01:30:09.987
TRAVIS: Give it a good heave-ho.

01:30:09.987 --> 01:30:12.242
MATT: Go ahead and make a strength 
check with advantage.

01:30:14.470 --> 01:30:16.556
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, 23.

01:30:16.556 --> 01:30:21.827
MATT: 23. As you pull, you hear the grinding of this chain 
against the stone, (cracking SFX)

01:30:21.827 --> 01:30:24.874
and you can see the actual door begin to 
rise upward this way.

01:30:24.874 --> 01:30:27.298
SAM: It's a Delorean.

01:30:27.298 --> 01:30:31.372
MATT: Essentially. When it opens up, it moves 
the magma out of the way.

01:30:31.372 --> 01:30:34.317
That's how this construct is used as an exit.
It's what I mentioned before.

01:30:34.317 --> 01:30:40.069
This is supposed to be an exit for the royal individuals 
of the stronghold.

01:30:40.069 --> 01:30:44.326
It only opens part way, however, because the stone wall 
currently blocks the rest of its movement.

01:30:44.326 --> 01:30:46.788
However, you can still move through it.

01:30:46.788 --> 01:30:49.183
LIAM: We can't leave this duergar behind though, 
we gotta take him out.

01:30:49.183 --> 01:30:52.462
MATT: Yes, there is one duergar still there.

01:30:52.462 --> 01:30:56.095
So that's been all of your guys' actions. We're bringing
it back. Pike, you haven't gone yet.

01:30:56.095 --> 01:30:57.964
ASHLEY: Okay.

01:30:57.964 --> 01:31:03.250
MATT: Keyleth you've gone, so the only one left to 
take an action is--

01:31:03.250 --> 01:31:05.201
MARISHA: Tiberius, have you gone?

01:31:05.201 --> 01:31:07.197
MATT: Yeah, he checked the doorway.

01:31:07.197 --> 01:31:08.233
MARISHA: Oh right.

01:31:08.233 --> 01:31:09.609
ASHLEY: Where's he at?

01:31:09.609 --> 01:31:11.284
MATT: He's up on top of the wall, about 25 feet from you.

01:31:11.284 --> 01:31:19.791
ASHLEY: I want to create a spiritual weapon, 
like a poisonous lasso, and (whiff SFX)

01:31:19.791 --> 01:31:21.675
and then put him down into the lava.

01:31:21.675 --> 01:31:24.300
MATT: Huh. Sure.

01:31:24.300 --> 01:31:26.410
(all laugh)

01:31:26.410 --> 01:31:28.565
SAM: A lariat of truth?

01:31:28.565 --> 01:31:30.123
TRAVIS: That's awesome.

01:31:30.123 --> 01:31:31.464
TALIESIN: Well, all right then.

01:31:31.464 --> 01:31:38.118
MATT: So using your spiritual weapon, you take a moment, 
you grasp your Sarenrae holy symbol around your neck,

01:31:38.118 --> 01:31:44.886
and as you pull your hand away from the symbol you see 
this glowing celestial rope extends out of nowhere.

01:31:44.886 --> 01:31:49.857
You begin to spin your fingers, and on its own, 
it begins to swirl and swirl.

01:31:49.857 --> 01:31:55.828
You then throw your hand forward and on its own, 
it cascades upward toward the edge of the wall.

01:31:55.828 --> 01:31:58.204
Go ahead and roll an attack roll.

01:31:58.204 --> 01:32:00.588
ASHLEY: An attack roll? Which is?

01:32:00.588 --> 01:32:02.947
MATT: Using your spell modifier as the attack bonus.

01:32:09.719 --> 01:32:11.558
ASHLEY: 10.

01:32:11.558 --> 01:32:14.168
SAM: Ooh. That ain't gonna do it.

01:32:14.168 --> 01:32:16.476
MATT: Total of 10?

01:32:16.476 --> 01:32:18.557
ASHLEY: I think so.

01:32:18.557 --> 01:32:19.774
(all laugh)

01:32:19.774 --> 01:32:21.140
MATT: What'd you roll?

01:32:21.140 --> 01:32:24.450
ASHLEY: I rolled a 2, and then I have a plus 8.

01:32:24.450 --> 01:32:26.544
MATT: Okay.

01:32:26.544 --> 01:32:29.795
SAM: That ain't no good.

01:32:29.795 --> 01:32:31.564
LIAM: It was a good idea though.

01:32:31.564 --> 01:32:33.135
LAURA: It was such a good idea.

01:32:33.135 --> 01:32:36.530
MATT: The celestial lasso, which you don't get the feeling
poison is something you could really muster

01:32:36.530 --> 01:32:38.803
based on your deity's central good--

01:32:38.803 --> 01:32:42.369
ASHLEY: I was just kidding! I was just getting 
a little crazy with ideas.

01:32:42.369 --> 01:32:48.706
MATT: I like it. However, as it heads over the wall, 
you see it does not find purchase on the duergar.

01:32:48.706 --> 01:32:50.592
It instead finds purchase on part of the wall.

01:32:50.592 --> 01:32:51.689
ASHLEY: Fuck.

01:32:51.689 --> 01:32:53.385
TRAVIS: Poisoning the wall effectively.

01:32:53.385 --> 01:32:56.139
MATT: Yes, it is now a poisoned property.

01:32:56.139 --> 01:32:58.340
ASHLEY: (laughs) Poisoning that wall, effectively. 
Gosh dang it. That would have been cool.

01:32:58.340 --> 01:32:59.746
MATT: That would have been cool, unfortunate bad roll.

01:32:59.746 --> 01:33:00.989
TRAVIS: It was going to be pretty cool.

01:33:00.989 --> 01:33:02.119
LIAM: Remember it for the future though.

01:33:02.119 --> 01:33:03.492
MATT: That brings us to the top of the round order.

01:33:03.492 --> 01:33:06.866
I believe at the top we have--

01:33:06.866 --> 01:33:08.153
SAM: Mister Me?

01:33:08.153 --> 01:33:09.229
MATT: Yes, Scanlan.

01:33:09.229 --> 01:33:14.513
SAM: Okay. Boy, oh boy.

01:33:17.443 --> 01:33:21.266
We're still trying to get that fucker up on the roof right?

01:33:21.266 --> 01:33:22.629
LIAM: Yes, he's going to run and tell people.

01:33:22.629 --> 01:33:25.170
SAM: I've got almost nothing. So I'll just -

01:33:29.309 --> 01:33:34.036
can I summon an Unseen Servant to push him?

01:33:34.036 --> 01:33:36.696
(all laugh)

01:33:36.696 --> 01:33:39.524
MARISHA: Oh yeah, that's a good idea.

01:33:39.524 --> 01:33:41.341
MATT: We can give it a shot.

01:33:41.341 --> 01:33:43.768
TRAVIS: Roll high. Roll really high.

01:33:43.768 --> 01:33:45.672
SAM: I don't have any ranged weapons.

01:33:45.672 --> 01:33:47.168
LAURA: Natural 20!

01:33:47.168 --> 01:33:49.556
MATT: So you conjure Unseen Servant.
Mark off your spell use.

01:33:49.556 --> 01:33:52.076
ORION: I look up and go, “Ooh, It's Monty's cousin.”

01:33:52.076 --> 01:33:56.668
MATT: You see a slight shimmer of ethereal energy 
behind the duergar.

01:33:56.668 --> 01:34:01.146
It's going to attempt to shove him. 
It isn't, unfortunately, on its own, extremely strong.

01:34:01.146 --> 01:34:05.786
It's mainly meant as an aide. However, it is possible. 
Go ahead and make an athletics check.

01:34:05.786 --> 01:34:08.198
Not your athletics, just make a d20 roll.

01:34:08.198 --> 01:34:09.990
SAM: Just a normal athletics.

01:34:09.990 --> 01:34:11.114
LIAM: Come on, 20.

01:34:11.114 --> 01:34:12.580
SAM: Yeah, I mean it's a 5, so.

01:34:12.580 --> 01:34:14.396
(all laugh)

01:34:14.396 --> 01:34:17.027
ASHLEY: What's your athletics? We're 
really rolling well tonight.

01:34:17.027 --> 01:34:22.326
MATT: You hear a (ting) sound as the duergar's
armor is given a hefty slap,

01:34:22.326 --> 01:34:24.201
but no apparent force is placed upon its body.

01:34:24.201 --> 01:34:25.779
ORION: A hefty slap.

01:34:25.779 --> 01:34:27.185
SAM: Thank you, Jarvis!

01:34:27.185 --> 01:34:28.837
(all laugh)

01:34:28.837 --> 01:34:30.773
SAM: But is he confused?

01:34:30.773 --> 01:34:35.693
MATT: A little bit, but not enough to not be loading 
his crossbow for a second shot.

01:34:35.693 --> 01:34:37.268
SAM: Damn it!

01:34:37.268 --> 01:34:38.946
MATT: Good thinking on that point.

01:34:38.946 --> 01:34:42.641
MARISHA: We're a party of 7 people just like, 
“Aw, damn it, you!"

01:34:42.641 --> 01:34:46.710
TALIESIN: Like a cat in a tree, just - (beckoning whistle)

01:34:46.710 --> 01:34:52.482
SAM: And I'm going to just give a little 
inspiration to Vax. That's Laura, obviously.

01:34:52.482 --> 01:34:54.264
(all laugh)

01:34:54.264 --> 01:34:55.514
LAURA: Yes, thank you.

01:34:55.514 --> 01:34:57.537
MARISHA: It inverted. That's what I always get mixed.

01:34:57.537 --> 01:34:59.624
MATT: All right, a d8 inspiration die to you as Scanlan
hums a little tune under his breath.

01:34:59.624 --> 01:35:00.970
LAURA: Nice.

01:35:00.970 --> 01:35:03.653
SAM: (hums Dueling Banjos)
MATT: You're up.

01:35:03.653 --> 01:35:05.622
LAURA: Oh! I attack him.

01:35:05.622 --> 01:35:06.950
MATT: All right.

01:35:06.950 --> 01:35:08.139
MARISHA: Pew pew.

01:35:08.139 --> 01:35:09.398
ASHLEY: Pew pew!

01:35:10.127 --> 01:35:11.139
LAURA: It's good.

01:35:11.139 --> 01:35:12.188
LIAM: It's a 1.

01:35:12.188 --> 01:35:13.707
MARISHA: Damn it! What is wrong with us?

01:35:13.707 --> 01:35:15.271
TRAVIS: What in the hot and holy shit is happening right now?

01:35:15.271 --> 01:35:16.290
ASHLEY: What are we doing?
MATT: That's your first attack?

01:35:16.290 --> 01:35:18.422
LAURA: My first attack is a serious fail. 
My second attack, though, is a 25.

01:35:18.422 --> 01:35:19.404
MATT: That hits.

01:35:19.404 --> 01:35:20.405
MARISHA: That's pretty cool.

01:35:20.405 --> 01:35:23.367
MATT: So the first one you pull back, and as you pull back 
the actual arrow snaps.

01:35:23.367 --> 01:35:24.935
LIAM: You almost shot me!

01:35:24.935 --> 01:35:26.777
LAURA: Ow, that hurt my arm so bad.

01:35:26.777 --> 01:35:28.246
MATT: Yeah, you're gonna have a little rash there 
probably tomorrow.

01:35:28.246 --> 01:35:30.816
LAURA: Great. 8.

01:35:30.816 --> 01:35:32.307
MATT: 8 damage, all right.

01:35:32.307 --> 01:35:35.169
Your second arrow manages to find its mark.

01:35:35.169 --> 01:35:42.788
As it sticks pretty close to where the first arrow hit, 
or where he was shot from the Bad News.

01:35:42.788 --> 01:35:48.700
The duergar just shrugs it off angrily, and aims 
his crossbow from once on Percy, now onto you.

01:35:48.700 --> 01:35:49.998
LAURA: (nervously) Haha.

01:35:49.998 --> 01:35:51.698
MATT: It's getting its shot at you.

01:35:51.698 --> 01:35:54.007
That is a 17 versus armor class.

01:35:54.007 --> 01:35:54.915
LAURA: Nope.

01:35:54.915 --> 01:35:55.818
MATT: Nope?

01:35:55.818 --> 01:35:56.812
LAURA: Nope.

01:35:56.812 --> 01:36:02.072
MATT: You manage to just dodge out of the way. 
You hear it whiz past your ear.

01:36:02.072 --> 01:36:04.455
That brings us to Percy.

01:36:04.455 --> 01:36:06.102
TALIESIN: I'll take one more shot at him.

01:36:06.102 --> 01:36:07.335
LIAM: Redemption, Percy.

01:36:07.335 --> 01:36:08.464
TRAVIS: Come on, buddy.

01:36:08.464 --> 01:36:09.422
SAM: Kill this guy.

01:36:09.422 --> 01:36:10.412
ASHLEY: Get it.

01:36:10.412 --> 01:36:11.944
SAM: He's lasted longer than most of the people we fight.

01:36:11.944 --> 01:36:13.515
MARISHA: (laughing) Yeah he has.

01:36:13.515 --> 01:36:14.758
TALIESIN: 18?

01:36:14.758 --> 01:36:17.391
MATT: 18 hits.

01:36:17.391 --> 01:36:19.114
TALIESIN: Come on die.

01:36:19.114 --> 01:36:20.299
TRAVIS: Come on, Percy.

01:36:20.299 --> 01:36:21.359
LIAM: Right in the belly button.

01:36:21.359 --> 01:36:23.210
MARISHA: Oh, that's nice. That's pretty.

01:36:23.210 --> 01:36:26.558
TALIESIN: That's 25 points of damage.

01:36:26.558 --> 01:36:27.782
TRAVIS: Thank you!

01:36:27.782 --> 01:36:29.005
LAURA: Yes!

01:36:29.005 --> 01:36:35.421
MATT: With a second (click), you pull out one of your custom made,
nasty looking bullets, load it back into Bad News.

01:36:35.421 --> 01:36:39.959
You pull it back, aim up, and fire. And once again, 
you guys are seeing this weapon up close again.

01:36:39.959 --> 01:36:44.867
With each fire, it takes all of his physical body to not get 
blown off his feet with each time it fires.

01:36:44.867 --> 01:36:46.794
LAURA: That's badass, Percy.

01:36:46.794 --> 01:36:52.600
MATT: (thunder crack) A plume of white and ash-like smoke 
comes shooting out the side of the weapon.

01:36:52.600 --> 01:36:56.380
Nearby, you almost have to close your ears instinctually
from the loudness of the shot.

01:36:56.380 --> 01:36:58.355
However, the duergar at the top of the wall,

01:36:58.355 --> 01:37:02.882
you see where his head once was just (wet impact SFX) 
across the wall behind it.

01:37:02.882 --> 01:37:04.539
ASHLEY: I love Bad News.

01:37:04.539 --> 01:37:05.633
TALIESIN: Let's move quickly.

01:37:05.633 --> 01:37:06.488
LAURA: Let's get in the door.

01:37:06.488 --> 01:37:07.429
SAM: I think they heard us.

01:37:07.429 --> 01:37:08.610
ORION: I go in the door.

01:37:08.610 --> 01:37:10.078
TALIESIN: Going in the door.

01:37:10.078 --> 01:37:11.787
LAURA: We all go in the door.

01:37:11.787 --> 01:37:14.645
MATT: All of you have made your way into the doorway.

01:37:14.645 --> 01:37:16.377
LAURA: Can Trinket fit? Trinket can fit.

01:37:16.377 --> 01:37:18.875
MATT: Trinket can fit with you, yes.

01:37:18.875 --> 01:37:20.139
LIAM: Just barely.

01:37:20.139 --> 01:37:21.667
ASHLEY: Just bear-ly.

01:37:21.667 --> 01:37:22.859
LIAM: It's like Winnie the Pooh, in the--

01:37:22.859 --> 01:37:25.081
LAURA: If Grog can fit, Trinket can fit.

01:37:27.071 --> 01:37:28.979
TALIESIN: It’s the one you don’t suit.

01:37:28.979 --> 01:37:31.919
TRAVIS: Oh no, we can't see anything.

01:37:33.629 --> 01:37:38.826
MATT: You guys make your way into this tiny little room--

01:37:38.826 --> 01:37:40.474
ALL: Whoa!

01:37:40.474 --> 01:37:43.757
MATT: You're all very crammed in, to get anywhere.

01:37:43.757 --> 01:37:46.109
LAURA: Into this (high voice) teeny-tiny little room.

01:37:46.109 --> 01:37:48.339
LIAM: Feels like an intermission room.

01:37:48.339 --> 01:37:52.547
LAURA: Oh. A bathroom break room?

01:37:52.547 --> 01:37:56.029
LIAM: Yes. We could all relieve ourselves in this room.

01:37:59.037 --> 01:38:02.921
MATT: You guys all slowly push into this storage room.

01:38:02.921 --> 01:38:06.326
It's very musty. It hasn't seen use in quite a while.

01:38:06.326 --> 01:38:10.145
In fact, you can see a little bit of mold is growing 
on the side of one of the barrels in the corner.

01:38:10.145 --> 01:38:11.789
ORION: Ooh, dank.

01:38:11.789 --> 01:38:15.478
MATT: There is a doorway that is closed on 
the opposite side of this wall,

01:38:15.478 --> 01:38:19.295
and from what you can see, there is a stairway 
that curves upwards to the second floor.

01:38:19.295 --> 01:38:21.017
LAURA: Ooh!

01:38:21.017 --> 01:38:23.564
SAM: Guys, I'm sensing a lot of purple and brown 
construction paper here.

01:38:23.564 --> 01:38:25.677
(all laugh)

01:38:25.677 --> 01:38:27.580
ORION: I am as well, Scanlan.

01:38:27.580 --> 01:38:28.899
LIAM: That's your favored terrain, right?

01:38:28.899 --> 01:38:29.981
SAM: It is.

01:38:29.981 --> 01:38:33.171
(all laugh)

01:38:34.283 --> 01:38:36.864
LAURA: Can we take an intermission break at this moment?

01:38:36.864 --> 01:38:38.642
MATT: I think as you guys just entered the stronghold,

01:38:38.642 --> 01:38:40.639
we'll take this as an intermission break.

01:38:40.639 --> 01:38:45.175
So take a little over 10 minutes. We'll watch the rest of the 
videos here again, and we'll return

01:38:45.175 --> 01:38:49.114
as the party has just entered the Emberhold itself.

01:38:49.114 --> 01:38:50.597
LAURA: All right. Oh wait, quick announcement.

01:38:50.597 --> 01:38:52.160
ZAC: A couple quick announcements.

01:38:52.160 --> 01:38:53.390
LIAM: Zac matches the construction paper.

01:38:53.390 --> 01:38:54.162
LAURA: What?!

01:38:54.162 --> 01:38:55.036
MARISHA: You do!

01:38:55.036 --> 01:38:56.626
(all laugh)

01:38:56.626 --> 01:38:58.137
ZAC: You can't see me!

01:38:58.137 --> 01:38:59.749
So guys before we go on intermission,

01:38:59.749 --> 01:39:01.984
I wanted to bring up one more time 826LA

01:39:01.984 --> 01:39:07.055
which is the charity that Critical Role is supporting.

01:39:07.055 --> 01:39:08.512
Do you want to give a brief--

01:39:08.512 --> 01:39:13.854
MARISHA: Yeah. A portion of our proceeds, or whatever 
our donations are, go to 826LA.

01:39:13.854 --> 01:39:16.166
They are an after-school tutoring program that help

01:39:16.166 --> 01:39:18.448
children between the ages of 5 and 18,

01:39:18.448 --> 01:39:21.084
mainly with literacy and creative writing and they have

01:39:21.084 --> 01:39:25.489
this awesome program where it's a young authors thing.

01:39:25.489 --> 01:39:29.262
You can buy all their books and their stories, and 
you should totally check them out.

01:39:29.262 --> 01:39:30.217
ZAC: Sweet!

01:39:30.217 --> 01:39:31.165
MATT: Fantastic.

01:39:31.165 --> 01:39:33.452
ZAC: So guys, we can spam you with that link in the chatroom

01:39:33.452 --> 01:39:36.031
if you want to support a charity for Critical Role.

01:39:36.031 --> 01:39:39.801
We also still have a giveaway at 2150 subs,

01:39:39.801 --> 01:39:42.803
which is a picture of the entire Critical Role cast

01:39:42.803 --> 01:39:46.046
they've all signed, and it's really cool.

01:39:46.046 --> 01:39:48.115
We'll show that to you guys again later, but we'll go ahead

01:39:48.115 --> 01:39:50.644
and roll those videos for you guys again.

01:39:50.644 --> 01:39:53.320
MATT: See if we can squeeze the intro 
again, that would be best.

01:39:53.320 --> 01:39:55.994
All right, cool guys, we'll see you again in a little bit.

01:39:56.874 --> 01:39:58.784
ASHLEY: Pike grew up in the outskirts of town,

01:39:58.784 --> 01:40:00.252
near the Bramblewood.

01:40:00.252 --> 01:40:02.081
Her ancestors were a family of deep gnomes

01:40:02.081 --> 01:40:04.949
with quite an unfavorable reputation.

01:40:04.949 --> 01:40:08.006
Thievery, destruction, and trickery left them

01:40:08.006 --> 01:40:10.914
with the curse of the last name Trickfoot.

01:40:10.914 --> 01:40:13.972
Sarenrae, the goddess of healing and redemption,

01:40:13.972 --> 01:40:16.465
had other plans for Pike's great-great-grandfather,

01:40:16.465 --> 01:40:19.052
Wilhand, who left his family at a young age

01:40:19.052 --> 01:40:21.087
after a dream.

01:40:21.087 --> 01:40:22.951
A dream that changed the course

01:40:22.951 --> 01:40:24.387
of the Trickfoot family.

01:40:24.387 --> 01:40:26.806
Wilhand devoted his life to Sarenrae

01:40:26.806 --> 01:40:28.962
and pledged from then on that him and his family

01:40:28.962 --> 01:40:31.987
would live a life of service and devotion.

01:40:31.987 --> 01:40:36.033
As a child, Pike seemed to have an affinity to heal.

01:40:36.033 --> 01:40:40.371
Whether it was animals, people, or even flowers,

01:40:40.371 --> 01:40:43.176
she felt she had a purpose in making things whole

01:40:43.176 --> 01:40:45.164
that had once been broken.

01:40:45.164 --> 01:40:47.194
She studied and learned the ways to heal

01:40:47.194 --> 01:40:48.677
through divine magic.

01:40:48.677 --> 01:40:51.824
She lived a peaceful life, quiet and simple,

01:40:51.824 --> 01:40:54.417
until one day, Wilhand was captured

01:40:54.417 --> 01:40:57.758
and almost killed by a group of goliath barbarians.

01:40:57.758 --> 01:40:59.515
One of the goliaths took a stand

01:40:59.515 --> 01:41:01.570
against the murder of the innocent gnome

01:41:01.570 --> 01:41:05.298
and he himself was beaten, bloodied, and left for dead,

01:41:05.298 --> 01:41:07.492
abandoned by his herd.

01:41:07.492 --> 01:41:09.770
Wilhand went to Pike for help.

01:41:09.770 --> 01:41:11.705
She prayed and healed this barbarian

01:41:11.705 --> 01:41:15.377
as best she could, bringing him back to life.

01:41:15.377 --> 01:41:18.612
When he awoke, she discovered his name

01:41:18.612 --> 01:41:21.120
was Grog Strongjaw.

01:41:21.120 --> 01:41:23.476
After that, they were best of friends,

01:41:23.476 --> 01:41:25.765
a rather unlikely pair.

01:41:25.765 --> 01:41:28.760
Little did she know that in a few years' time

01:41:28.760 --> 01:41:30.866
Grog would soon return the favor

01:41:30.866 --> 01:41:33.835
and bring her back from the clutches of death.

01:41:33.835 --> 01:41:36.835
(roar) (wet smack sounds)

01:41:36.835 --> 01:41:38.566
After being killed in battle,

01:41:38.566 --> 01:41:40.006
Pike felt angry.

01:41:40.006 --> 01:41:41.388
She wanted to be stronger

01:41:41.388 --> 01:41:43.569
so that it would never happen again.

01:41:43.569 --> 01:41:45.392
She spent four months at sea

01:41:45.392 --> 01:41:46.865
training with the men and women

01:41:46.865 --> 01:41:49.948
aboard a ship called the Broken Howl.

01:41:49.948 --> 01:41:52.506
Gripping her holy symbol in one hand,

01:41:52.506 --> 01:41:54.676
and her morningstar in the other,

01:41:54.676 --> 01:41:56.759
this time, Pike is ready.

01:41:58.958 --> 01:42:01.934
TRAVIS: Right, Listen up! If you have ale,

01:42:01.934 --> 01:42:05.968
then you have a friend in Grog Strongjaw!

01:42:05.968 --> 01:42:09.711
A goliath of towering height and size,

01:42:09.711 --> 01:42:13.342
this barbarian has an appetite for the two great

01:42:13.342 --> 01:42:18.758
loves in his life: combat, women, and ale! (chuckle)

01:42:18.758 --> 01:42:19.835
(record scratch)

01:42:19.835 --> 01:42:20.667
Wait.

01:42:20.667 --> 01:42:23.440
Easily the brains of the group,

01:42:23.440 --> 01:42:26.407
Grog is often consulted for his vast knowledge

01:42:26.407 --> 01:42:30.500
of shapes, colors, and (chuckle) shiny things!

01:42:30.500 --> 01:42:32.556
...also ale.

01:42:32.556 --> 01:42:36.552
In his early years, armed with his two-handed great axe,

01:42:36.552 --> 01:42:39.493
Grog often enjoyed proving his might amongst the ranks

01:42:39.493 --> 01:42:42.235
of his family's wandering herd.

01:42:42.235 --> 01:42:46.525
But after coming upon an unsuspecting elderly gnome in the woods,

01:42:46.525 --> 01:42:50.721
he objected to the killing such an innocent life.

01:42:50.721 --> 01:42:55.616
A creature of impulse, Grog felt only pity for this...

01:42:55.616 --> 01:42:58.551
well this terrified little thing.

01:42:58.551 --> 01:43:01.602
And his disobedience cost him dearly.

01:43:01.602 --> 01:43:02.876
(weapon crack)

01:43:02.876 --> 01:43:05.722
Beaten bloody, and banished by the herd leader,

01:43:05.722 --> 01:43:07.050
his uncle Kevdak,

01:43:07.050 --> 01:43:10.704
Grog was abandoned and left to die.

01:43:10.704 --> 01:43:13.808
Exiled from his herd, it was then that

01:43:13.808 --> 01:43:17.217
the relative of the very gnome he fought to save

01:43:17.217 --> 01:43:19.364
saved him.

01:43:19.364 --> 01:43:22.915
It was the kindness of a gnome cleric named Pike

01:43:22.915 --> 01:43:26.775
that healed Grog, bringing him back from death's edge.

01:43:26.775 --> 01:43:30.431
And they have remained close friends ever since.

01:43:30.431 --> 01:43:32.182
(brawling sounds)

01:43:32.182 --> 01:43:34.227
Most nights, Grog can be found challenging

01:43:34.227 --> 01:43:36.525
entire taverns to wrestling matches! Ha!

01:43:36.525 --> 01:43:39.400
...or accompanying Scanlan to the nearest house,

01:43:39.400 --> 01:43:41.653
where you pay for...

01:43:41.653 --> 01:43:43.322
lady favors.

01:43:43.322 --> 01:43:45.153
Also ale!

01:43:46.571 --> 01:43:48.422
MARISHA: A first Impression of Keyleth would

01:43:48.422 --> 01:43:49.908
leave you with little information

01:43:49.908 --> 01:43:51.797
on the half-elven druid.

01:43:51.797 --> 01:43:54.029
You might even think that her social awkwardness

01:43:54.029 --> 01:43:56.601
due to her sheltered upbringing is kinda sweet.

01:43:56.601 --> 01:43:57.726
(chuckle)

01:43:57.726 --> 01:44:01.210
Of course, it would be unwise to underestimate her

01:44:01.210 --> 01:44:02.798
based on first impressions.

01:44:02.798 --> 01:44:03.992
(thunder crack)

01:44:03.992 --> 01:44:06.629
Under that unintimidating petite frame is a

01:44:06.629 --> 01:44:09.261
vicious beast waiting to be unleashed,

01:44:09.261 --> 01:44:11.517
whose natural powers have made even the fiercest of

01:44:11.517 --> 01:44:14.937
champions pee their pants, literally!

01:44:14.937 --> 01:44:16.159
(soft chuckle)

01:44:16.159 --> 01:44:18.347
Born to the Air Tribe of the Ashari people,

01:44:18.347 --> 01:44:20.445
Keyleth was raised with a deep love

01:44:20.445 --> 01:44:23.234
of nature and the elemental magics.

01:44:23.234 --> 01:44:26.008
It is her people’s inherent duty to protect the

01:44:26.008 --> 01:44:27.740
delicate areas in Tal'Dorei

01:44:27.740 --> 01:44:31.725
where the four elemental planes begin to bleed with this realm.

01:44:31.725 --> 01:44:34.321
Since she was a little girl, she had quite a knack

01:44:34.321 --> 01:44:37.102
for air manipulation and beast shaping abilities.

01:44:37.102 --> 01:44:39.454
Well, if you consider kittens and

01:44:39.454 --> 01:44:42.219
flying squirrels to be little beasts.

01:44:42.219 --> 01:44:43.569
Which, I do.

01:44:43.569 --> 01:44:44.828
(clears throat)

01:44:44.828 --> 01:44:47.883
Anyways, it wasn't long before the headmaster of the tribe,

01:44:47.883 --> 01:44:49.489
her father, Kohren,

01:44:49.489 --> 01:44:51.697
realized her true prodigious abilities and

01:44:51.697 --> 01:44:56.033
she was inveterated to succeed him as the next headmaster.

01:44:56.033 --> 01:44:59.225
Just like that, her jovial childhood was stripped and

01:44:59.225 --> 01:45:01.720
replaced with endless spell memorization,

01:45:01.720 --> 01:45:03.415
teachings from ancient traditions,

01:45:03.415 --> 01:45:06.245
and exceedingly high expectations.

01:45:06.245 --> 01:45:08.953
Every druid leader-to-be must embark on journey

01:45:08.953 --> 01:45:10.390
to seek out the sister tribes

01:45:10.390 --> 01:45:12.679
in order to introduce and establish respect

01:45:12.679 --> 01:45:14.987
amongst the fellow headmasters.

01:45:14.987 --> 01:45:19.258
They call this the Aramente, or Noble Odyssey.

01:45:19.258 --> 01:45:22.120
When her father felt she was ready, he set her on the path

01:45:22.120 --> 01:45:24.284
to truly discovering herself.

01:45:24.284 --> 01:45:27.639
Not knowing when, or if she will ever return.

01:45:27.639 --> 01:45:30.320
As she hiked down the mountain towards Stillben,

01:45:30.320 --> 01:45:33.028
she meditated on the task ahead.

01:45:33.028 --> 01:45:35.703
Part of the Aramente is proving yourself

01:45:35.703 --> 01:45:38.370
a strong warrior, a valiant protector,

01:45:38.370 --> 01:45:40.889
and a wise and compassionate leader.

01:45:40.889 --> 01:45:43.309
With this knowledge, one thought plays

01:45:43.309 --> 01:45:45.511
in repeat in her mind:

01:45:45.511 --> 01:45:48.178
Is she even worthy?

01:45:50.603 --> 01:45:52.767
TALIESIN: Percy was the third child of 7 children,

01:45:52.767 --> 01:45:54.814
born to a noble family who lived far to the

01:45:54.814 --> 01:45:58.117
north in the ancient castle of Whitestone.

01:45:58.117 --> 01:46:00.331
With so many siblings to share the burdens of

01:46:00.331 --> 01:46:02.402
lordship, Percy turned his attention to the

01:46:02.402 --> 01:46:06.113
sciences, engineering, and naturalism.

01:46:06.113 --> 01:46:08.350
One day, a mysterious couple

01:46:08.350 --> 01:46:11.165
named Lord and Lady Briarwood came to court.

01:46:11.165 --> 01:46:13.069
During a feast held in their honor,

01:46:13.069 --> 01:46:15.995
the Briarwoods violently took control of the castle,

01:46:15.995 --> 01:46:20.192
killing or imprisoning everyone who would stand in their way.

01:46:20.192 --> 01:46:22.307
Percy awoke chained in the dungeon,

01:46:22.307 --> 01:46:24.770
only to be freed by his younger sister.

01:46:24.770 --> 01:46:28.452
Together they fled, chased by the Briarwoods’ men.

01:46:28.452 --> 01:46:30.754
As they ran, Percy’s sister took

01:46:30.754 --> 01:46:33.595
several arrows to the chest and fell.

01:46:33.595 --> 01:46:35.895
Percy kept running, eventually jumping into

01:46:35.895 --> 01:46:39.612
a freezing river and floating unconscious to freedom.

01:46:39.612 --> 01:46:42.459
He did not remember waking up on a fishing boat.

01:46:42.459 --> 01:46:44.515
He barely remembered the next two years, as he

01:46:44.515 --> 01:46:48.461
slowly made his way as far south as possible.

01:46:48.461 --> 01:46:51.283
Then one night, Percy had a dream.

01:46:51.283 --> 01:46:53.604
A roaring cloud of smoke offered him

01:46:53.604 --> 01:46:56.898
vengeance against those who destroyed his family.

01:46:56.898 --> 01:47:01.299
When he awoke, Percy began to design his first gun.

01:47:01.299 --> 01:47:03.749
(click sound) (gunshot)

01:47:04.324 --> 01:47:07.302
SAM: Oh, you haven’t heard of Scanlan Shorthalt?

01:47:07.302 --> 01:47:08.815
Well, gird your loins, ladies,

01:47:08.815 --> 01:47:11.023
because he has his eye on you.

01:47:11.023 --> 01:47:13.615
A talented musician, master of disguise, and dashingly

01:47:13.615 --> 01:47:17.292
handsome in his own mind, Scanlan sings songs

01:47:17.292 --> 01:47:20.320
almost as much as he sings his own praises.

01:47:20.320 --> 01:47:23.337
Born a poor gnome, Scanlan used his endless

01:47:23.337 --> 01:47:25.242
charm and soaring tenor voice to

01:47:25.242 --> 01:47:28.113
croon for coin and support his single mother.

01:47:28.113 --> 01:47:31.081
One day he was discovered by a half-orc promoter

01:47:31.081 --> 01:47:35.110
and joined Dr. Dranzel’s Spectacular Traveling Troupe

01:47:35.110 --> 01:47:37.341
where he learned the ways of the world,

01:47:37.341 --> 01:47:40.868
and honed his skills as a bard extraordinaire.

01:47:40.868 --> 01:47:43.463
A loner much of his life, Scanlan has never quite

01:47:43.463 --> 01:47:44.864
come to terms with the violent

01:47:44.864 --> 01:47:48.207
death of his mother at the hands of a goblin invasion.

01:47:48.207 --> 01:47:51.304
While his years on the road provided many, shall we say,

01:47:51.304 --> 01:47:54.714
educational experiences with the opposite sex,

01:47:54.714 --> 01:47:57.486
deep down Scanlan yearns for the one thing

01:47:57.486 --> 01:47:59.829
he’s never known: the true love

01:47:59.829 --> 01:48:01.839
of a fellow gnome.

01:48:01.839 --> 01:48:05.330
Still, Scanlan considers himself a lover first,

01:48:05.330 --> 01:48:08.726
performer second, and fighter distant third.

01:48:08.726 --> 01:48:10.890
On the battlefield, he’ll support his allies,

01:48:10.890 --> 01:48:14.051
but rarely draws blood unless it’s to protect

01:48:14.051 --> 01:48:17.925
fellow gnome, Pike. Count on Scanlan for a hearty laugh,

01:48:17.925 --> 01:48:21.626
a rollicking song, and a twinkle in his eye that melts hearts

01:48:21.626 --> 01:48:24.374
and makes the females swoon.

01:48:26.744 --> 01:48:29.060
ORION: Greetings and salutations.

01:48:29.060 --> 01:48:31.248
I am Tiberius Stormwind.

01:48:31.248 --> 01:48:33.523
I hail from a town called Ty'rex,

01:48:33.523 --> 01:48:35.721
located in the heart of Draconia,

01:48:35.721 --> 01:48:38.028
born from a politically respected family.

01:48:38.028 --> 01:48:41.387
At the age of 15, I succeeded in passing the Sorcerer’s Rite,

01:48:41.387 --> 01:48:43.677
showing prodigy-like control of my magic.

01:48:43.677 --> 01:48:46.417
The judges and the Draconian high council were amazed at

01:48:46.417 --> 01:48:49.874
how powerful my spells were for how long I had been training.

01:48:49.874 --> 01:48:52.436
At 20 years old, I was the youngest appointed member

01:48:52.436 --> 01:48:55.178
of the magic guild in Draconian history. For the

01:48:55.178 --> 01:48:56.956
next few years, I almost went mad from the

01:48:56.956 --> 01:48:58.940
malaise of being a guild member,

01:48:58.940 --> 01:49:01.400
as it’s rather boring.

01:49:01.400 --> 01:49:04.010
However, one day I happened upon a chamber,

01:49:04.010 --> 01:49:05.997
unused for quite some time.

01:49:05.997 --> 01:49:08.445
In the room were stacks of books and maps

01:49:08.445 --> 01:49:09.963
of the surrounding cities and areas

01:49:09.963 --> 01:49:11.381
around the known world.

01:49:11.381 --> 01:49:13.752
For months I would frequent the chamber, and learned

01:49:13.752 --> 01:49:15.728
of artifacts from legend.

01:49:15.728 --> 01:49:18.639
After a long period of research, I made a list of artifacts

01:49:18.639 --> 01:49:20.022
that caught my eye.

01:49:20.022 --> 01:49:22.202
I brought these findings to the high council and was told that

01:49:22.202 --> 01:49:25.499
all of the information in the chamber I had stumbled upon

01:49:25.499 --> 01:49:29.113
was either believed to be fiction, or unsolvable mysteries,

01:49:29.113 --> 01:49:31.276
and hence were lost forever.

01:49:31.276 --> 01:49:34.038
I found those answers to be unacceptable.

01:49:34.038 --> 01:49:36.351
A year later I devised a ruse and managed to

01:49:36.351 --> 01:49:38.303
convince the city council to lend support

01:49:38.303 --> 01:49:40.360
in me leaving Draconia on a mission of peace

01:49:40.360 --> 01:49:42.937
and diplomacy for the surrounding kingdoms.

01:49:42.937 --> 01:49:45.455
Going from town to town and making friends and allies,

01:49:45.455 --> 01:49:47.358
in and for the name of Draconia.

01:49:47.358 --> 01:49:49.309
Being a red dragonborn,

01:49:49.309 --> 01:49:52.299
I had quite the task on my hands in that respect,

01:49:52.299 --> 01:49:54.975
but it was exactly what I needed so I could explore

01:49:54.975 --> 01:49:56.988
the world and find these artifacts,

01:49:56.988 --> 01:49:59.659
as I felt the truth was out there.

01:49:59.659 --> 01:50:01.620
Some may describe me as buffoonish,

01:50:01.620 --> 01:50:03.620
but I say poppycock to all that.

01:50:03.620 --> 01:50:06.602
I am much sharper than most give me credit for.

01:50:06.602 --> 01:50:09.703
I just don’t pay attention to things sometimes.

01:50:09.703 --> 01:50:12.903
I’ve also been known to be rather cunning, loyal,

01:50:12.903 --> 01:50:16.787
happy-go-lucky, and well, dangerous.

01:50:16.787 --> 01:50:20.071
I can’t help but show my true scales every now and then.

01:50:20.071 --> 01:50:23.053
But overall, I think I’m quite friendly for a Dragonborn.

01:50:24.984 --> 01:50:26.850
LIAM: Never entirely welcome in the company of

01:50:26.850 --> 01:50:29.011
elves or men, Vax'ildan learned

01:50:29.011 --> 01:50:32.133
at a young age to skip past formality,

01:50:32.133 --> 01:50:35.483
preferring instead to invite himself in your door.

01:50:35.483 --> 01:50:37.871
Along with twin sister Vex'ahlia,

01:50:37.871 --> 01:50:40.447
Vax was born by a chance encounter between elven

01:50:40.447 --> 01:50:43.395
royalty and human peasantry.

01:50:43.395 --> 01:50:45.969
Raised by their mother in their early years, the twins

01:50:45.969 --> 01:50:47.972
were eventually sent off to their father

01:50:47.972 --> 01:50:50.102
in the elven capital of Singorn.

01:50:50.102 --> 01:50:53.802
But their cool reception among the elves there never warmed,

01:50:53.802 --> 01:50:56.229
and their time in the capital didn’t last.

01:50:56.229 --> 01:50:59.253
The siblings stole away one autumn night and set out on

01:50:59.253 --> 01:51:00.713
the open road.

01:51:00.713 --> 01:51:04.228
After a few years of wandering, they eventually decided to

01:51:04.228 --> 01:51:06.355
return to their mother, and journeyed

01:51:06.355 --> 01:51:08.445
back to the lands of their youth.

01:51:08.445 --> 01:51:11.061
But instead of finding their childhood home,

01:51:11.061 --> 01:51:13.839
they returned to a pile of rubble.

01:51:13.839 --> 01:51:17.597
Their mother was gone, their home burned to ash.

01:51:17.597 --> 01:51:20.408
Pressing the townspeople for answers,

01:51:20.408 --> 01:51:23.187
they learned of the day the dragon came.

01:51:23.187 --> 01:51:26.121
(dragon roaring)

01:51:26.121 --> 01:51:29.353
With their ties all severed, Vax'ildan and his sister

01:51:29.353 --> 01:51:33.329
set out to find their fortune together in Tal'Dorei.

01:51:33.329 --> 01:51:37.135
An outsider since birth, Vax quickly learned to solve life’s

01:51:37.135 --> 01:51:40.544
challenges in his own particular way,

01:51:40.544 --> 01:51:43.178
often by sidestepping them entirely.

01:51:43.178 --> 01:51:47.016
And when his knack for circumventing adversity isn’t enough,

01:51:47.016 --> 01:51:48.556
(ringing weapons SFX)

01:51:48.556 --> 01:51:51.214
the way of blades the elves schooled him in

01:51:51.214 --> 01:51:53.156
more than makes up the difference.

01:51:54.391 --> 01:51:56.197
LAURA: Like so many half-elves,

01:51:56.197 --> 01:51:58.427
Vex'ahlia has spent most of her life suffering

01:51:58.427 --> 01:52:03.332
the cool reception of a people who don’t fully accept her.

01:52:03.332 --> 01:52:07.411
Born of a human mother and an elven father who only later in life

01:52:07.411 --> 01:52:09.973
took an interest in their existence,

01:52:09.973 --> 01:52:13.391
Vex'ahlia and her twin brother Vax'ildan quickly

01:52:13.391 --> 01:52:16.688
realized the only people they could truly rely on

01:52:16.688 --> 01:52:19.784
in this world were each other.

01:52:19.784 --> 01:52:23.342
It was at the age of 10 when the two were taken from their mother

01:52:23.342 --> 01:52:25.279
and brought to live in Singorn,

01:52:25.279 --> 01:52:29.312
the isolated elven city for which their father was an ambassador.

01:52:29.312 --> 01:52:33.642
He quietly took them in, but always kept an icy distance,

01:52:33.642 --> 01:52:36.446
and after too many years of disdainful looks,

01:52:36.446 --> 01:52:40.018
the pair decided to leave his indifference behind,

01:52:40.018 --> 01:52:42.247
and set out on their own.

01:52:42.247 --> 01:52:46.153
Vax took to the cities, stealing small trinkets and

01:52:46.153 --> 01:52:48.206
learning the ways of the thief,

01:52:48.206 --> 01:52:51.358
while Vex kept to the woods.

01:52:51.358 --> 01:52:53.581
She preferred the isolation.

01:52:53.581 --> 01:52:57.759
Always the keen observer, she learned to hunt and to track,

01:52:57.759 --> 01:53:00.208
to spy and to shoot.

01:53:00.208 --> 01:53:02.552
And through a series of fateful events,

01:53:02.552 --> 01:53:06.597
earned herself a companion in the form of a bear -

01:53:06.597 --> 01:53:09.000
her own stolen Trinket -

01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:13.011
to fight alongside her and protect her fiercely.

01:53:13.011 --> 01:53:17.662
Also he is adorable, and gives expert massages.

01:53:19.795 --> 01:53:25.070
(drumming battle music)

01:53:48.907 --> 01:53:54.059
(drumming battle music continues)

01:54:27.204 --> 01:54:28.563
ORION: Still alive!

01:54:28.563 --> 01:54:29.907
MATT: (laughs) Welcome back, guys.

01:54:29.907 --> 01:54:31.936
Welcome back to Critical Role.

01:54:31.936 --> 01:54:33.612
And we have Orion -- .

01:54:33.612 --> 01:54:34.694
LIAM: Holy hell.

01:54:34.694 --> 01:54:35.777
TALIESIN: Ow.

01:54:35.777 --> 01:54:36.776
MARISHA: Are you okay?

01:54:36.776 --> 01:54:37.698
TALIESIN: I'm fine.

01:54:37.698 --> 01:54:39.445
MATT: 2d6 damage to Tiberius.

01:54:39.445 --> 01:54:41.330
So, guys, for those who are keeping up:

01:54:41.330 --> 01:54:42.813
two things, real fast.

01:54:42.813 --> 01:54:47.280
We want to thank Jacqueline Lassiter for the 
awesome food she sent for us.

01:54:47.280 --> 01:54:49.558
ALL: (words of acclamation and thanks)

01:54:49.558 --> 01:54:50.669
MATT: Seriously, thank you.

01:54:50.669 --> 01:54:52.420
A delightful, necessary treat after this game time.

01:54:52.420 --> 01:54:54.009
So, thank you, thank you, thank you.

01:54:54.009 --> 01:54:58.199
Also for the 2,150-subscriber mark, we're giving away

01:54:58.199 --> 01:55:00.587
this autographed photo of the cast.

01:55:00.587 --> 01:55:01.994
LAURA: Autographed photo.

01:55:01.994 --> 01:55:03.571
MATT: We'll send out to you.

01:55:03.571 --> 01:55:04.913
LIAM: It's so handsome.

01:55:04.913 --> 01:55:06.065
MARISHA: Who is it going to?

01:55:06.065 --> 01:55:07.928
MATT: Some lucky person in the chatroom 
once we hit 2,150.

01:55:07.928 --> 01:55:09.120
MARISHA: Oh. We don't know yet.

01:55:09.120 --> 01:55:11.017
MATT: Whenever that happens, that will be going to you.

01:55:11.017 --> 01:55:13.310
So, yes, returning to the game--

01:55:13.310 --> 01:55:15.871
SAM: Also, we've got these t-shirts. You should want them.

01:55:15.871 --> 01:55:17.680
(Laura and Marisha laugh)

01:55:17.680 --> 01:55:19.143
MATT: We're going to now look into--

01:55:19.143 --> 01:55:20.098
MARISHA: Yes, let us know if you want them.

01:55:20.098 --> 01:55:21.053
LAURA: We're going to look into that.

01:55:21.053 --> 01:55:22.144
MATT: We're going to look into possibly finding a way

01:55:22.144 --> 01:55:23.818
to get these shirts to you guys in the next couple weeks.

01:55:23.818 --> 01:55:24.974
MARISHA: Only if you want them, though.

01:55:24.974 --> 01:55:26.743
This is going to be a lot of work.

01:55:26.743 --> 01:55:28.706
We don't want to do it unless you really want them.

01:55:28.706 --> 01:55:29.458
ORION: We hate doing work.

01:55:29.458 --> 01:55:30.268
TRAVIS: We're voice actors.

01:55:30.268 --> 01:55:31.270
TALIESIN: We're not here to work.

01:55:31.270 --> 01:55:34.717
SAM: Where are we? We were just going in a door.

01:55:34.717 --> 01:55:36.463
MATT: Indeed. You guys--

01:55:36.463 --> 01:55:37.878
LIAM: Come on. Yes, they want them.

01:55:37.878 --> 01:55:41.431
MATT: Cool. I guess that feedback is good.

01:55:41.431 --> 01:55:45.515
The party had just managed to not-quite-so-stealthily

01:55:45.515 --> 01:55:49.409
pry their way into the hidden entrance to the outside

01:55:49.409 --> 01:55:52.081
of the duergar stronghold of Emberhold.

01:55:52.081 --> 01:55:56.493
They found themselves crammed into a very tiny,

01:55:56.493 --> 01:55:58.970
essentially a storage room,

01:55:58.970 --> 01:56:02.111
with a stairway leading up and a closed doorway

01:56:02.111 --> 01:56:04.453
leading further into the stronghold.

01:56:04.453 --> 01:56:07.112
So, what is your preference?

01:56:07.112 --> 01:56:10.087
LAURA: I think we should go through the door, 
instead of going up.

01:56:10.087 --> 01:56:11.192
LIAM: I agree.

01:56:11.192 --> 01:56:12.717
LAURA: Because any prisoners are probably

01:56:12.717 --> 01:56:14.593
going to be kept at a low level.

01:56:14.593 --> 01:56:16.579
TALIESIN: Can we quietly open the door?

01:56:16.579 --> 01:56:18.044
MATT: Yeah, once inside.

01:56:18.044 --> 01:56:20.057
LAURA: Can we very stealthily try to open -

01:56:20.057 --> 01:56:21.857
oh, check for traps!

01:56:21.857 --> 01:56:25.799
LIAM: Yes, I'm going to sniff the door a bit.

01:56:25.799 --> 01:56:28.058
MATT: All right.

01:56:28.058 --> 01:56:30.172
LAURA: (sniffing SFX)

01:56:30.172 --> 01:56:31.374
LIAM: Yeah, that's a 20.

01:56:31.374 --> 01:56:38.375
MATT: 20? Best you can tell, the door itself is locked,

01:56:38.375 --> 01:56:40.349
but is not trapped.

01:56:40.349 --> 01:56:42.644
LIAM: Okay, well - (clinking SFX)

01:56:42.644 --> 01:56:44.375
Okay, thieves’ tools out.

01:56:44.375 --> 01:56:45.768
Oh, that's an easy 30.

01:56:45.768 --> 01:56:46.916
SAM: 30?!

01:56:46.916 --> 01:56:48.018
MATT: A 30!

01:56:48.018 --> 01:56:49.106
LIAM: 30.

01:56:49.106 --> 01:56:50.356
SAM: Jesus.
MARISHA: God damn.

01:56:50.356 --> 01:56:52.202
MATT: Which is good because it's a very, very intricate lock.

01:56:52.202 --> 01:56:55.983
There is a specific key, a single key that 
is designed for this lock,

01:56:55.983 --> 01:56:59.878
that you gather is probably held by King Murghol himself.

01:56:59.878 --> 01:57:01.571
ASHLEY: King Myrtle?

01:57:01.571 --> 01:57:03.010
LAURA: Mairgil. Mare - Mairgil?

01:57:03.010 --> 01:57:04.010
MATT: Mur-ghol.

01:57:04.010 --> 01:57:04.803
MARISHA: Marigold.

01:57:04.803 --> 01:57:05.893
SEVERAL: Murghol.

01:57:05.893 --> 01:57:07.560
SAM: And his queen, Durarara.

01:57:07.560 --> 01:57:09.454
MATT: (laughs)

01:57:09.454 --> 01:57:12.339
MARISHA: Is that how you pronounce 
her name? Doo-gara-gar?

01:57:12.339 --> 01:57:13.782
LIAM: It's, uh, Ermahgerd?

01:57:13.782 --> 01:57:16.299
ALL: Ermahgerd.

01:57:16.299 --> 01:57:17.533
LAURA: Ulara is her name.

01:57:17.533 --> 01:57:18.565
ORION: Kuma.

01:57:18.565 --> 01:57:19.592
LAURA: Queen Ulara.

01:57:19.592 --> 01:57:20.471
SAM: Ulara. Uhura.

01:57:20.471 --> 01:57:21.419
MATT: Yes. Uhura.

01:57:21.419 --> 01:57:22.235
MARISHA: Uhura.

01:57:22.235 --> 01:57:23.027
TALIESIN: Kana.

01:57:23.027 --> 01:57:23.623
MATT: Kumar.

01:57:23.623 --> 01:57:24.873
MARISHA: I don't know! What is her name?

01:57:24.873 --> 01:57:25.750
Seriously, what is her name, now?

01:57:25.750 --> 01:57:26.432
LAURA: It's Ulara! Ulara.

01:57:26.432 --> 01:57:27.141
SAM: Ulara.

01:57:27.141 --> 01:57:27.901
MARISHA: What is -- ?

01:57:27.901 --> 01:57:28.571
SEVERAL: Ulara.

01:57:28.571 --> 01:57:29.744
MARISHA: Ulara. (giggles)

01:57:29.744 --> 01:57:30.601
MATT: Shh.

01:57:30.601 --> 01:57:32.129
TALIESIN: Maybe not.

01:57:32.129 --> 01:57:35.627
MARISHA: Uladra. Right?

01:57:35.627 --> 01:57:37.210
LIAM: I'm picking a lock.

01:57:37.210 --> 01:57:39.111
LAURA: Shh. He's picking a lock. Be very quiet.

01:57:39.111 --> 01:57:40.261
LIAM: (clicking SFX)

01:57:40.261 --> 01:57:42.693
MATT: However, you do manage to find a series

01:57:42.693 --> 01:57:44.475
of intricate, strangely-constructed dwarven tumblers

01:57:44.475 --> 01:57:48.118
on the inside that each have a very strange, 
rigid structure -- (laughs)

01:57:48.118 --> 01:57:49.928
LIAM: ‘Ey!

01:57:49.928 --> 01:57:52.091
MATT: Please do that every time you pick a lock.

01:57:52.091 --> 01:57:54.176
You manage to get the right sequence,

01:57:54.176 --> 01:57:56.910
and with a slight - (clicking SFX) - clicking sound,

01:57:56.910 --> 01:58:00.113
(squeak SFX) the door opens slightly on the inside.

01:58:00.113 --> 01:58:01.692
LAURA: Yes.

01:58:01.692 --> 01:58:02.976
LIAM: It was pretty easy.

01:58:02.976 --> 01:58:05.711
MATT: Leading into what you can see is a hallway,

01:58:07.375 --> 01:58:12.055
that continues further down to about there.

01:58:12.055 --> 01:58:13.628
LIAM: Where is the door?

01:58:13.628 --> 01:58:15.127
Where is the door that I just picked?

01:58:15.127 --> 01:58:16.217
MATT: The door that you picked, if you wanted

01:58:16.217 --> 01:58:17.740
to walk through is right there.

01:58:17.740 --> 01:58:18.882
LIAM: It's naturally there.

01:58:18.882 --> 01:58:21.614
LAURA: So that other stuff is upstairs.

01:58:22.918 --> 01:58:24.510
MATT: All of this is on the floor that you're on.

01:58:24.510 --> 01:58:26.420
LAURA: Oh! Okay.

01:58:27.920 --> 01:58:32.008
LIAM: I'm going to take six or seven 
quiet steps forward, stealthily.

01:58:35.170 --> 01:58:36.673
19 stealth.

01:58:36.673 --> 01:58:37.888
MATT: All right.

01:58:37.888 --> 01:58:42.571
ORION: As he does this, I'm going to pull out my Ioun stone

01:58:42.571 --> 01:58:44.566
from my pouch, and let it-- (whirling SFX)

01:58:44.566 --> 01:58:45.877
MATT: All right, cool.

01:58:45.877 --> 01:58:47.062
TRAVIS: We're all trapped in that room together, right?

01:58:47.062 --> 01:58:47.973
MATT: You are. Correct.

01:58:47.973 --> 01:58:49.162
TRAVIS: I fart.

01:58:49.162 --> 01:58:50.533
(all laugh)

01:58:50.533 --> 01:58:53.721
ORION: Oh! Grog! Prestidigitation, and I (whoosh SFX)

01:58:53.721 --> 01:58:55.273
make a quick wind-gust--

01:58:55.273 --> 01:58:56.276
MATT: Okay.

01:58:56.276 --> 01:58:57.685
LIAM: Just circulate it around the room, will you?

01:58:57.685 --> 01:58:58.843
ORION: I blew it away!

01:58:58.843 --> 01:59:01.672
I could blow it right up your nose, Vax! (fluttering SFX)

01:59:01.672 --> 01:59:03.945
TRAVIS: I'm closer to you now than I've ever been before.

01:59:03.945 --> 01:59:05.305
LAURA: I throw up in my mouth just a little bit.

01:59:05.305 --> 01:59:06.478
TALIESIN: Go around the corner and tell us what you see.

01:59:06.478 --> 01:59:07.288
MATT: Just a little bit.

01:59:07.288 --> 01:59:08.339
ORION: Oh. I'm sorry.

01:59:08.339 --> 01:59:09.154
MATT: (laughs)

01:59:09.154 --> 01:59:10.525
TALIESIN: Take a very quiet peek around the corner.

01:59:10.525 --> 01:59:12.053
LIAM: All right, I'm having a peeky-poo.

01:59:12.053 --> 01:59:13.177
TALIESIN: Quietly.

01:59:13.177 --> 01:59:16.916
MATT: As you peek through, you can get a general idea

01:59:16.916 --> 01:59:26.424
of what looks to be some sort of an empty storage room.

01:59:26.424 --> 01:59:28.720
A lot of materials have been moved out of it.

01:59:28.720 --> 01:59:31.748
It looks like the remnants of stone,

01:59:31.748 --> 01:59:33.889
things that were used for construction that once were

01:59:33.889 --> 01:59:35.699
in this room that have been pulled out to build things.

01:59:35.699 --> 01:59:37.545
Possibly moved as part of the war camp to start building

01:59:37.545 --> 01:59:40.708
some of the siege weapons that you saw above.

01:59:40.708 --> 01:59:43.027
LIAM: Do I hear anything?

01:59:43.027 --> 01:59:45.119
MATT: Not currently. Roll a perception check.

01:59:45.119 --> 01:59:47.325
LIAM: Yes.

01:59:47.325 --> 01:59:49.015
LAURA: Oh, that's good.

01:59:49.015 --> 01:59:50.823
LIAM: That's pretty good. 27.

01:59:50.823 --> 01:59:53.967
MATT: Listening, you hear footsteps above.

01:59:53.967 --> 01:59:57.018
You hear very, very faintly through the stonework about

01:59:57.018 --> 02:00:00.652
20 feet above you - (thumping SFX) -

02:00:00.682 --> 02:00:03.147
some footsteps moving above.

02:00:03.147 --> 02:00:06.821
Apparently there is some level of alert on the second floor.

02:00:06.821 --> 02:00:08.883
LAURA: Oh, shit. We should move fast.

02:00:08.883 --> 02:00:09.970
MARISHA: Hmm. I wonder why.

02:00:09.970 --> 02:00:10.855
LIAM: Go figure.

02:00:10.855 --> 02:00:11.724
LAURA: We should get out of the room.

02:00:11.724 --> 02:00:12.710
ORION: Yes, Percy, I wonder why.

02:00:12.710 --> 02:00:13.792
LAURA: We start getting out of the room.

02:00:13.792 --> 02:00:15.569
TALIESIN: It’s a wonder, looking outside.

02:00:15.569 --> 02:00:17.039
LIAM: I go back to the door and just be like--

02:00:17.039 --> 02:00:18.579
LAURA: (whispering) Come on. Hurry!

02:00:18.579 --> 02:00:22.543
LIAM: So, I want to go further - no 
doorway, as of yet. Correct?

02:00:22.543 --> 02:00:23.813
MATT: No doorway here.

02:00:23.813 --> 02:00:24.867
LIAM: If I go this way--

02:00:24.867 --> 02:00:26.371
LAURA: They're going to start coming down 
these fricking stairs in this room.

02:00:26.371 --> 02:00:28.061
MATT: This way? It ends. The hallway 
comes to an end, with a wall.

02:00:28.061 --> 02:00:30.868
LIAM: Well then, I'm going to peek into 
this door here. This open door.

02:00:30.868 --> 02:00:32.064
MATT: Here?

02:00:32.064 --> 02:00:33.830
LIAM: No. What's right by the figure?

02:00:33.830 --> 02:00:35.626
MATT: This is the one you just looked into that had 
this empty room that--

02:00:35.626 --> 02:00:37.808
LIAM: Thank you, thank you. So, down the one hall.

02:00:37.808 --> 02:00:39.938
MATT: Down the one hall.

02:00:39.938 --> 02:00:42.273
Look past here there is a stairway that descends downward.

02:00:42.273 --> 02:00:43.779
LIAM: Down.

02:00:43.779 --> 02:00:45.719
MATT: Looking down - pardon me.

02:00:49.980 --> 02:00:54.635
Looking down this hallway, you see what resembles -

02:00:54.635 --> 02:00:57.476
there's a door to your left that's closed currently,

02:00:57.476 --> 02:00:59.815
and it splits off into two directions, right and left.

02:00:59.815 --> 02:01:01.248
LIAM: Right, I don't even tell anyone.

02:01:01.248 --> 02:01:02.989
I just start to slink down the steps.

02:01:02.989 --> 02:01:04.026
MATT: Okay.

02:01:04.026 --> 02:01:05.206
LAURA: Did he go down?

02:01:05.206 --> 02:01:06.477
LIAM: Yes.

02:01:06.477 --> 02:01:07.693
LAURA: Oh, geez Louise.

02:01:07.693 --> 02:01:09.441
MATT: Okay.

02:01:11.988 --> 02:01:14.026
Put Clarota there.

02:01:15.828 --> 02:01:18.009
You continue down the stairway, and as you 
slowly move around,

02:01:18.009 --> 02:01:19.935
you can see down towards the bottom

02:01:19.935 --> 02:01:24.068
a very faint bit of reddish glow-stone light

02:01:24.068 --> 02:01:26.029
and a hallway that splits right and left.

02:01:26.029 --> 02:01:27.620
Laura: (whispering) We should go downstairs.

02:01:27.620 --> 02:01:29.170
LIAM: Right and left? I go to the right.

02:01:29.170 --> 02:01:30.264
MATT: Okay.

02:01:30.264 --> 02:01:31.668
TRAVIS: Why don’t we just go left?

02:01:31.668 --> 02:01:32.793
LAURA: We're getting bored.

02:01:32.793 --> 02:01:33.810
MATT: As you look past the right - you guys

02:01:33.810 --> 02:01:34.734
are all waiting in the room?

02:01:34.734 --> 02:01:35.467
LIAM: You should just storm in.

02:01:35.467 --> 02:01:36.137
LAURA: I get out.

02:01:36.137 --> 02:01:37.050
LIAM: Start banging your weapons together.

02:01:37.050 --> 02:01:38.566
LAURA: No! I come out, because you're taking too long.

02:01:38.566 --> 02:01:39.421
MARISHA: (laughs)

02:01:39.421 --> 02:01:40.311
MATT: Anyone else?

02:01:40.311 --> 02:01:41.321
ORION: I saunter about.

02:01:41.321 --> 02:01:43.025
(all laugh)

02:01:43.025 --> 02:01:44.469
ASHLEY: I'll head on out there.

02:01:44.469 --> 02:01:45.897
SAM: I go where Pike goes.

02:01:45.897 --> 02:01:48.000
MARISHA: We're just losing all attention span?

02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:50.098
Is that what's going on? We're just wandering off.

02:01:50.098 --> 02:01:50.977
LAURA: No no no.

02:01:50.977 --> 02:01:52.658
I said we stay in the area, but I wanted to check

02:01:52.658 --> 02:01:54.517
on my brother because I feel like he's taking awhile.

02:01:54.517 --> 02:01:55.567
MATT: All right.

02:01:55.567 --> 02:01:57.940
LAURA: And he was just gonna check the doors.

02:01:57.940 --> 02:02:00.864
MATT: As you move and glance over, you can see

02:02:00.864 --> 02:02:04.805
there are two duergar stationed on each 
side of the split hallways.

02:02:04.805 --> 02:02:07.976
One is a closed doorway to your right, and to the left

02:02:07.976 --> 02:02:11.091
there's an open doorway that leads into a room.

02:02:11.091 --> 02:02:13.017
LIAM: And that's when I went to the right?

02:02:13.017 --> 02:02:15.503
MATT: Well, as soon as you went into where the division was,

02:02:15.503 --> 02:02:17.795
you turned to the right and there were duergar there,

02:02:17.795 --> 02:02:19.325
and a duergar on the left.

02:02:19.325 --> 02:02:21.526
LIAM: I'm going to turn my chin over to the left,

02:02:21.526 --> 02:02:22.797
and see what I see down there.

02:02:22.797 --> 02:02:24.318
MATT: There's a second duergar that is currently

02:02:24.318 --> 02:02:27.219
sitting in armor, weapon to its side.

02:02:27.219 --> 02:02:28.801
Just occasionally glancing in.

02:02:28.801 --> 02:02:30.805
You can hear, every now and then,

02:02:30.805 --> 02:02:35.998
sounds like a moan or a slight whispering gurgle,

02:02:35.998 --> 02:02:37.712
and the duergar will lean in -

02:02:37.712 --> 02:02:40.035
“Hey, shut up in there! 'Kay?!”

02:02:40.035 --> 02:02:43.330
LIAM: Yeah, I'm going to go kill this guy.

02:02:43.330 --> 02:02:44.828
LAURA: You don't want to tell us what you found?

02:02:44.828 --> 02:02:46.119
ORION: As I notice him going up, I'm going to -

02:02:46.119 --> 02:02:48.715
(click) Vax, what are you doing?

02:02:48.715 --> 02:02:51.642
LIAM: (softly) Uh, I'm killing someone. Hold, please.

02:02:51.642 --> 02:02:53.879
(all laughing)

02:02:53.879 --> 02:02:56.336
SAM: (humming a Muzak version of "The Girl from Ipanema")

02:02:56.336 --> 02:02:57.889
ORION: Uh, guys, Vax is going to go kill something.

02:02:57.889 --> 02:02:59.935
MARISHA: It's okay. Let him do it by himself.

02:02:59.935 --> 02:03:01.369
It's what he does best.

02:03:01.369 --> 02:03:02.780
LIAM: I'm going to sneak up on this duergar.

02:03:02.780 --> 02:03:03.876
MATT: Make a stealth check.

02:03:03.876 --> 02:03:05.064
ORION: I worry.

02:03:05.064 --> 02:03:06.640
MARISHA: I know. It's okay.

02:03:06.640 --> 02:03:07.756
LIAM: 19?

02:03:07.756 --> 02:03:10.814
MATT: 19? Let me go ahead and--

02:03:10.814 --> 02:03:13.262
LAURA: Oh, no! Look at this.

02:03:13.262 --> 02:03:14.991
MATT: This'll be an interesting--

02:03:14.991 --> 02:03:16.792
LIAM: Like a magician, you just whip it out, Matt.

02:03:16.792 --> 02:03:18.325
MATT: That's what I'm doing.

02:03:18.325 --> 02:03:19.827
Trying, at least.

02:03:19.827 --> 02:03:21.257
There we go.

02:03:21.257 --> 02:03:22.984
TRAVIS: Do you want an extra hand?

02:03:22.984 --> 02:03:24.969
TALIESIN: If Mr. Wizard can do it, you can do it.

02:03:24.969 --> 02:03:26.566
SAM: Watch out!

02:03:26.566 --> 02:03:28.028
LAURA It's that book.

02:03:28.028 --> 02:03:29.936
MATT: Oh, it is the book, isn't it?

02:03:29.936 --> 02:03:31.926
Stupid book.

02:03:43.068 --> 02:03:49.164
As you've made your way here,

02:03:50.922 --> 02:03:52.737
Vex [sic] you look to the right.

02:03:52.737 --> 02:03:57.951
There's the duergar here to the left 
that's shouting into this room here.

02:03:58.926 --> 02:04:00.230
SAM: Do something!

02:04:00.230 --> 02:04:01.613
MATT: You missed entirely what I was telling you.

02:04:01.613 --> 02:04:02.574
TRAVIS: Will you fucking do something, please?

02:04:02.574 --> 02:04:03.879
LIAM: He's right there on the side.

02:04:03.879 --> 02:04:05.954
There's one over there, there's one over there.

02:04:05.954 --> 02:04:08.986
There's two. Oh, shit.

02:04:12.617 --> 02:04:14.701
Well, we all come slamming down in here.

02:04:14.701 --> 02:04:15.680
SAM: Yeah!

02:04:15.680 --> 02:04:17.179
TRAVIS: No, you're down there.

02:04:17.179 --> 02:04:22.445
LIAM: So I sneak back up and I put 
a hand on my sister's shoulder,

02:04:22.445 --> 02:04:25.604
and I give her a little come along motion.

02:04:25.604 --> 02:04:28.217
And tell everyone else--

02:04:28.217 --> 02:04:29.702
SAM: Don't you need some Grog?

02:04:29.702 --> 02:04:33.809
LIAM: --I mouth "Kima" at everybody, 
and then pull my sister down.

02:04:33.809 --> 02:04:35.513
MATT: As you're doing this, you hear footsteps

02:04:35.513 --> 02:04:37.173
across the way echoing through the hallway,

02:04:37.173 --> 02:04:39.936
what sounds like a number of other foot patters

02:04:39.936 --> 02:04:41.109
heading through the halls--

02:04:41.109 --> 02:04:42.468
LAURA: (gasps) We should just go down.

02:04:42.468 --> 02:04:44.216
MATT: --towards the front of the stronghold.

02:04:44.216 --> 02:04:46.150
LIAM: I'm just pulling Vex down.

02:04:46.150 --> 02:04:48.664
ORION: The front? Oh, the front of the front.

02:04:48.664 --> 02:04:50.287
Not where we're at, right?

02:04:50.287 --> 02:04:53.449
MATT: Vex and Vax both disappear off to the side, down a hallway.

02:04:53.449 --> 02:04:56.719
MARISHA: Before they leave I just tap their shoulders

02:04:56.719 --> 02:05:00.363
and meditate and grant them Guidance.

02:05:00.363 --> 02:05:01.593
MATT: Okay, you can give one of them

02:05:01.593 --> 02:05:02.745
Guidance because it's concentration.

02:05:02.745 --> 02:05:03.920
MARISHA: Uh, Vex.

02:05:03.920 --> 02:05:05.373
MATT: Okay.

02:05:05.373 --> 02:05:06.235
LAURA: That's me.

02:05:06.235 --> 02:05:07.097
MATT: Yes.

02:05:07.097 --> 02:05:07.959
MARISHA: Fuck.

02:05:07.959 --> 02:05:09.838
LAURA: Did you mean to give it to him?

02:05:09.838 --> 02:05:11.233
MARISHA: Yes.

02:05:11.233 --> 02:05:16.088
(everyone laughs)

02:05:16.088 --> 02:05:17.116
ORION: Brava.

02:05:17.116 --> 02:05:19.510
MATT: All right, who gets guidance?

02:05:19.510 --> 02:05:21.900
SAM: The man one.

02:05:21.900 --> 02:05:23.273
MATT: Vax.

02:05:23.273 --> 02:05:24.540
MARISHA: Vax.

02:05:24.540 --> 02:05:32.307
LIAM: So I pull my poison blade out and 
I pull the keen dagger out.

02:05:32.307 --> 02:05:33.966
Okay, and I take the keen dagger -

02:05:33.966 --> 02:05:35.367
so the one on the left is by the door and the one

02:05:35.367 --> 02:05:36.614
that muttered through the doorway, right?

02:05:36.614 --> 02:05:37.509
MATT: The one right here.

02:05:37.509 --> 02:05:39.935
LIAM: So I give a little fwip, toss in my hand

02:05:39.935 --> 02:05:42.273
and throw it right at his neck.

02:05:42.273 --> 02:05:45.008
LAURA: At the same time I reach out and I go (arrow SFX).

02:05:45.008 --> 02:05:48.626
LIAM: And the other one, the poison one, toward the other.

02:05:48.626 --> 02:05:50.327
MATT: Okay and you are?

02:05:50.327 --> 02:05:51.861
LAURA: And I was going to shoot at the other one.

02:05:51.861 --> 02:05:54.278
MATT: Go ahead and roll for this guy here.

02:05:54.278 --> 02:05:57.865
LIAM: That guy.

02:05:57.865 --> 02:06:00.865
That is a 17 for me.

02:06:00.865 --> 02:06:02.286
MATT: 17 hits.

02:06:02.286 --> 02:06:03.289
LAURA: 27.

02:06:03.289 --> 02:06:04.384
MATT: 27, all right.

02:06:04.384 --> 02:06:06.765
LIAM: And then on the other guy, or should 
I just go ahead and attack?

02:06:06.765 --> 02:06:08.914
MATT: Go ahead and attack both.

02:06:08.914 --> 02:06:10.552
LIAM: 17. So that’s--

02:06:10.552 --> 02:06:11.949
LAURA: And 25 on the same.

02:06:11.949 --> 02:06:14.066
MATT: Both arrows on the guy on the right?

02:06:14.066 --> 02:06:15.579
LAURA: Let’s do both, one on each.

02:06:15.579 --> 02:06:17.490
MATT: Each? (shooting SFX) You both - (impact SFX) - ?

02:06:17.490 --> 02:06:18.390
LAURA: Yeah!

02:06:18.390 --> 02:06:22.490
MATT: Okay, cool. Damage on the one on the left?

02:06:22.490 --> 02:06:25.389
Which is sneak attack because he didn’t know you were there.

02:06:28.391 --> 02:06:35.111
LIAM: So, 46 with the keen dagger on the guard at the door.

02:06:35.111 --> 02:06:36.363
TALIESIN: Damn.

02:06:36.363 --> 02:06:38.648
LAURA: So I was really useful!

02:06:38.648 --> 02:06:41.056
MATT: The guy on the left, as he’s leaning back,

02:06:41.056 --> 02:06:42.919
he’s getting angry with whoever is in that room.

02:06:42.919 --> 02:06:44.887
As he turns back to take his post again,

02:06:44.887 --> 02:06:49.023
(swoosh SFX) (gurgling) he just gurgles, 
slumps to the ground.

02:06:49.023 --> 02:06:52.409
As he’s slumping, an arrow goes (impact sound)
into his stomach.

02:06:52.409 --> 02:06:53.733
(everyone laughs)

02:06:53.733 --> 02:06:55.608
LIAM: It’s like a punctuation.

02:06:55.608 --> 02:06:57.206
LAURA &amp;amp; MATT: Yeah.

02:06:57.206 --> 02:06:59.327
MATT: Roll damage for the second attack.

02:06:59.327 --> 02:07:00.975
LIAM: The poison dagger goes (thunk sound).

02:07:00.975 --> 02:07:02.223
Well, I didn’t roll to hit him.

02:07:02.223 --> 02:07:03.275
MATT: And you are using the poison effect on him?

02:07:03.275 --> 02:07:04.411
LIAM: Yes.

02:07:04.411 --> 02:07:05.580
LAURA: 15 on the other guy for me.

02:07:05.580 --> 02:07:07.327
LIAM: That is a 19.

02:07:07.327 --> 02:07:09.708
MATT: Okay, that hits. Now roll damage.

02:07:09.708 --> 02:07:11.864
LIAM: This doesn’t get sneak attack?

02:07:11.864 --> 02:07:12.948
MATT: No.

02:07:12.948 --> 02:07:14.834
LIAM: Because I already used that.

02:07:14.834 --> 02:07:17.610
I made some noise hitting the first guy.

02:07:17.610 --> 02:07:20.469
7 plus the poison.

02:07:20.469 --> 02:07:23.336
MATT: What is the poison damage?

02:07:23.336 --> 02:07:26.369
LIAM: The poison is DC 15.

02:07:26.369 --> 02:07:29.287
MATT: He does not make the save, 
even though he’s a duergar.

02:07:29.287 --> 02:07:31.990
LAURA: I go running back up since 
I’ve already shot my arrows.

02:07:31.990 --> 02:07:33.344
MATT: Let me check one thing real fast.

02:07:33.344 --> 02:07:34.822
LAURA: And I figured you’ve got this.

02:07:34.822 --> 02:07:36.654
MATT: Check one thing.

02:07:36.654 --> 02:07:39.154
ASHLEY: He could just clear this whole place by himself.

02:07:39.154 --> 02:07:40.493
LIAM: 9 points of poison on him.

02:07:40.493 --> 02:07:45.239
MATT: Okay. So, an arrow (impact SFX) into his chest

02:07:45.239 --> 02:07:48.006
just as the poison blade makes contact.

02:07:48.006 --> 02:07:51.683
You can see him (gurgling SFX) double over for a second,

02:07:51.683 --> 02:07:55.189
but the hardy duergar once-dwarven form

02:07:55.189 --> 02:07:57.956
seems to shrug off a lot of the poison’s impact.

02:07:57.956 --> 02:07:59.316
LAURA: Oh, shit!

02:07:59.316 --> 02:08:02.529
MATT: He is still dribbling a very heavy 
amount of deep crimson

02:08:02.529 --> 02:08:05.236
from his mouth, but he still (gasps) looks over

02:08:05.236 --> 02:08:07.279
and sees you both in the hallway

02:08:07.279 --> 02:08:10.069
and goes to reach for his warhammer

02:08:10.069 --> 02:08:11.859
and turn around towards the door behind him.

02:08:11.859 --> 02:08:15.316
LAURA: Can I throw an arrow at him?

02:08:15.316 --> 02:08:16.817
LIAM: Do we roll for initiative at this point?

02:08:16.817 --> 02:08:18.962
MATT: You guys roll for initiative to see who goes first.

02:08:20.476 --> 02:08:22.439
SAM: I turn to Pike and say,

02:08:22.439 --> 02:08:25.153
“What the fuck is going on? Where are they?”

02:08:25.153 --> 02:08:26.972
ORION: I don’t know, but this book, Scanlan, is incredible.

02:08:26.972 --> 02:08:28.158
SAM: I’m sure it is.

02:08:28.158 --> 02:08:30.052
ORION: It’s all about this, er, an ice thing--

02:08:30.052 --> 02:08:31.278
SAM: I read non-fiction.

02:08:31.278 --> 02:08:32.658
ORION: --and these other things.

02:08:32.658 --> 02:08:33.729
ASHLEY: Let’s head down there. I’m going 
to head down there.

02:08:33.729 --> 02:08:34.574
LIAM: Careful, clanky.

02:08:34.574 --> 02:08:35.496
ASHLEY: Oh.

02:08:35.496 --> 02:08:37.573
MATT: So the rest of you are heading down there?

02:08:37.573 --> 02:08:38.912
TRAVIS: I follow Pike down there.

02:08:38.912 --> 02:08:40.055
SAM: I’m going, too.

02:08:40.055 --> 02:08:41.160
LAURA: There are so many prisoners down this way.

02:08:41.160 --> 02:08:42.098
MATT: Everyone else roll stealth checks.

02:08:42.098 --> 02:08:43.154
LAURA: Everybody fucking come down.

02:08:43.154 --> 02:08:43.883
MARISHA: Are we going down?

02:08:43.883 --> 02:08:45.154
MATT: Stealth checks everyone.

02:08:45.154 --> 02:08:46.230
You guys both beat him on initiative.

02:08:46.230 --> 02:08:46.968
LAURA: Yes.

02:08:46.968 --> 02:08:51.241
MATT: Roll attacks, both of you, just roll the dice.

02:08:51.241 --> 02:08:52.352
SAM: Roll the dice.

02:08:52.352 --> 02:08:53.563
ORION: Roll the dice.

02:08:53.563 --> 02:08:54.873
ASHLEY: 19.

02:08:54.873 --> 02:08:55.886
LIAM: 28.

02:08:55.886 --> 02:08:57.351
ASHLEY: Getting a handle on my armor.

02:08:57.351 --> 02:08:58.266
MATT: Okay. You don’t need to roll damage.

02:08:58.266 --> 02:08:59.103
He has like, 2 hit points left.

02:08:59.103 --> 02:09:01.174
You guys pepper him with additional arrows and daggers.

02:09:01.174 --> 02:09:02.662
The poor guys is like:

02:09:02.662 --> 02:09:04.730
“Uh, I’m gonna--” (impact SFX, gurgle)

02:09:04.730 --> 02:09:07.568
He just goes down with this horrible sense of overkill,

02:09:07.568 --> 02:09:10.261
his body just slumps up against the door,

02:09:10.261 --> 02:09:14.298
leaning against the wooden door he was guarding.

02:09:14.298 --> 02:09:15.586
LAURA: I say on my earring:

02:09:15.586 --> 02:09:17.342
“I think we found the prison cells. Get down here.”

02:09:17.342 --> 02:09:18.533
SAM: We’re coming.

02:09:18.533 --> 02:09:19.673
ORION: I’m assuming they’re dead.

02:09:19.673 --> 02:09:21.011
MATT: Both duergar.

02:09:21.011 --> 02:09:22.178
LIAM: I start to loot the bodies.

02:09:22.178 --> 02:09:23.082
MATT: Stealth checks?

02:09:23.082 --> 02:09:23.725
ORION: 16.

02:09:23.725 --> 02:09:24.360
MARISHA: 17.

02:09:24.360 --> 02:09:25.019
TALIESIN: 12.

02:09:25.019 --> 02:09:25.631
SAM: 12.

02:09:25.631 --> 02:09:26.391
TRAVIS: 20.

02:09:26.391 --> 02:09:27.890
ASHLEY: 19.

02:09:27.890 --> 02:09:29.883
MATT: All right, go team!

02:09:29.883 --> 02:09:32.457
MARISHA: Woo! We’re stealthy bastards.

02:09:32.457 --> 02:09:35.267
MATT: That was with disadvantage?

02:09:35.267 --> 02:09:36.496
ASHLEY: I have to roll again?

02:09:36.496 --> 02:09:37.489
LIAM: Yes.

02:09:37.489 --> 02:09:38.322
LAURA: Why?

02:09:38.322 --> 02:09:39.596
MATT: Because you’re in heavy plate armor.

02:09:39.596 --> 02:09:40.748
MARISH &amp;amp; LAURA: No!

02:09:40.748 --> 02:09:43.234
ALL: (words of encouragement)

02:09:46.684 --> 02:09:48.685
ASHLEY: (laughs)

02:09:48.685 --> 02:09:50.265
LAURA: That’s not bad, that’s still not bad.

02:09:50.265 --> 02:09:51.942
ASHLEY: I rolled an 8.

02:09:51.942 --> 02:09:52.665
MATT: Okay.

02:09:52.665 --> 02:09:53.488
LAURA: Plus what?

02:09:53.488 --> 02:09:54.388
ASHLEY: Plus nothing.

02:09:54.388 --> 02:09:55.769
(all laugh)

02:09:55.769 --> 02:09:57.588
MATT: Okay.

02:09:57.588 --> 02:10:00.560
LIAM: (clanking SFX)

02:10:00.560 --> 02:10:04.665
MATT: You guys, all rush down the stairs (stomping SFX)

02:10:04.665 --> 02:10:06.461
the clanking of the plate armor as you're going down.

02:10:06.461 --> 02:10:09.535
The rest of you wince as you notice it,

02:10:09.535 --> 02:10:12.256
but you make it down anyway.

02:10:12.256 --> 02:10:13.437
ASHLEY: (laughing) Oh my God.

02:10:13.437 --> 02:10:14.535
TRAVIS: I should have picked you up.

02:10:14.535 --> 02:10:16.096
MARISHA: I'm actually going to go ahead and throw Guidance

02:10:16.096 --> 02:10:17.121
on Pike now.

02:10:17.121 --> 02:10:18.280
SAM: Little late, little late.

02:10:18.280 --> 02:10:19.883
TALIESIN: What does Guidance do?

02:10:19.883 --> 02:10:22.973
MARISHA: It gives you a plus on your ability checks.

02:10:22.973 --> 02:10:26.501
And it gives you a 1d4 plus to your--

02:10:26.501 --> 02:10:27.979
(several talking at once)

02:10:27.979 --> 02:10:29.404
SAM: Do they already knew [sic] we were here?

02:10:29.404 --> 02:10:30.403
Now they really know.

02:10:30.403 --> 02:10:34.781
MATT: So, the rest of you have made it down.

02:10:34.781 --> 02:10:37.051
LIAM: Surprise!

02:10:37.051 --> 02:10:38.505
MATT: In this hallway, there are 2 dead 
duergar on the ground.

02:10:38.505 --> 02:10:40.250
One with a closed door and one with an open door.

02:10:40.250 --> 02:10:43.682
LAURA: Well, let's go look in the 
open door. Stealthily.

02:10:43.682 --> 02:10:45.212
MATT: You glance over into the open door,

02:10:45.212 --> 02:10:48.758
you can see what appears to be a series of dungeon cells

02:10:48.758 --> 02:10:52.498
held underneath the stronghold.

02:10:52.498 --> 02:10:54.350
LIAM: Lady Kima?

02:10:54.350 --> 02:10:56.713
MATT: Within these, you can see there are a number

02:10:56.713 --> 02:11:00.612
of dwarven captives that are in very, very, very poor health--

02:11:00.612 --> 02:11:01.935
TALIESIN: I don't care about them.

02:11:01.935 --> 02:11:03.470
LAURA: We need to get them awake.

02:11:03.470 --> 02:11:05.366
MATT: --that are currently lying down, unfed, gaunt.

02:11:05.366 --> 02:11:06.472
SAM: Are any of them Lady Kima?

02:11:06.472 --> 02:11:07.672
Because if they're not, they're about to die.

02:11:07.672 --> 02:11:09.220
LAURA: No, they're regular dwarves, they're good people.

02:11:09.220 --> 02:11:11.198
ORION: I go inspect them and see what's going on.

02:11:11.198 --> 02:11:12.372
MATT: Okay.

02:11:12.372 --> 02:11:14.551
MARISHA: I'll go in with Tiberius.

02:11:14.551 --> 02:11:17.135
MATT: Okay, you guys enter.

02:11:17.135 --> 02:11:21.855
As you look around, there are a series of largely

02:11:21.855 --> 02:11:24.274
decomposed bodies in a few of these cells.

02:11:24.274 --> 02:11:26.122
They are people who've just been left to die.

02:11:26.122 --> 02:11:27.345
LAURA: Oh no.

02:11:27.345 --> 02:11:30.082
MATT: One, there are these kind of strange deep underground,

02:11:30.082 --> 02:11:34.040
rat-like creatures that are feeding on one of them.

02:11:34.040 --> 02:11:36.892
One of the dwarves is just wheezing in pain (moaning).

02:11:36.892 --> 02:11:39.671
You can see his stomach is a little distended.

02:11:39.671 --> 02:11:42.212
The other one is either unconscious, asleep, or dead.

02:11:42.212 --> 02:11:43.732
You can't tell.

02:11:43.732 --> 02:11:48.373
ASHLEY: Can I do a Mass Cure on them?

02:11:48.373 --> 02:11:49.676
MATT: You can if you'd like.

02:11:49.676 --> 02:11:52.115
ASHLEY: Okay. I'll do that.

02:11:52.115 --> 02:11:53.125
LIAM: Yes, I was about to say.

02:11:53.125 --> 02:11:54.419
I'm going to go start inspecting the other door.

02:11:54.419 --> 02:11:55.539
TALIESIN: I'll go with him.

02:11:55.539 --> 02:11:56.947
LAURA: Why don't you unlock the prison cells here?

02:11:56.947 --> 02:11:58.162
MARISHA: Yeah, can you unlock the prison cells?

02:11:58.162 --> 02:11:58.970
LIAM: Oh, sorry.

02:11:58.970 --> 02:12:01.762
LAURA: Can we go in? Can we talk to them?

02:12:01.762 --> 02:12:04.857
MATT: If you guys want to.

02:12:04.857 --> 02:12:06.685
So you go through. It's fairly simple

02:12:06.685 --> 02:12:09.714
over time for you to unlock the cells 
if you'd like, the 2 that are in there.

02:12:09.714 --> 02:12:16.392
There's a difference between healing magic and nutrition.

02:12:16.392 --> 02:12:21.426
You make them feel physically better for the moment,

02:12:21.426 --> 02:12:23.873
but their physical form itself is failing.

02:12:23.873 --> 02:12:27.215
TRAVIS: Just a thought, shouldn't we clear this mess 
before we let prisoners out?

02:12:27.215 --> 02:12:28.788
MATT: They need food, they need air,

02:12:28.788 --> 02:12:30.410
they need to be out of here soon.

02:12:30.410 --> 02:12:31.613
They're both on the edge of death.

02:12:31.613 --> 02:12:32.777
SAM: Put them in the bag of holding, Grog.

02:12:32.777 --> 02:12:34.053
MARISHA: I pull out a water.

02:12:34.053 --> 02:12:36.996
ORION: I go to the room, I take out my bottle of water..

02:12:36.996 --> 02:12:39.931
MARISHA: I'll do the opposite one.

02:12:39.931 --> 02:12:42.577
MATT: You guys hear heavy footsteps 
coming from the stairway

02:12:42.577 --> 02:12:43.901
you guys just descended from.

02:12:43.901 --> 02:12:46.932
TRAVIS: I go stand right next to the stairway.

02:12:46.932 --> 02:12:48.557
MARISHA &amp;amp; TALIESIN: In the cells, in the cells.

02:12:48.557 --> 02:12:50.510
LIAM: I pull my sister and we flank.

02:12:50.510 --> 02:12:52.290
I push her into flanking position to the door.

02:12:52.290 --> 02:12:55.079
LAURA: Oh God, I nock an arrow, notch an arrow?

02:12:55.079 --> 02:12:56.735
ORION: Where are they coming from?

02:12:56.735 --> 02:12:59.840
LIAM: The stairs, from where we entered?

02:12:59.840 --> 02:13:01.963
MATT: What are you guys doing?

02:13:01.963 --> 02:13:05.015
MARISHA: I jump in the cells and I pull

02:13:05.015 --> 02:13:09.142
a dead, decomposing corpse over the top of me.

02:13:09.142 --> 02:13:12.825
LAURA: Eww, Keyleth. All kinds of nastiness.

02:13:12.825 --> 02:13:15.062
TALIESIN: I find a corner of a cell and slowly pull out my gun.

02:13:15.062 --> 02:13:16.333
MARISHA: I’m going savage!

02:13:16.333 --> 02:13:18.511
(all laugh)

02:13:18.511 --> 02:13:21.253
TALIESIN: I should make sure all the 
doors are shut, not locked.

02:13:21.253 --> 02:13:23.754
MATT: All right, all the doors are shut.

02:13:23.754 --> 02:13:26.210
Pike, anything you doing?

02:13:26.210 --> 02:13:28.678
ASHLEY: I'm just, you know, preparing.

02:13:28.678 --> 02:13:30.093
MATT: (laughs) All right.

02:13:30.093 --> 02:13:31.412
MARISHA: Just kicking it, just chilling.

02:13:31.412 --> 02:13:33.643
LAURA: Do we need to move out of the way of the stairs?

02:13:33.643 --> 02:13:35.375
LIAM: Vax is scooching Scanlan out of the way

02:13:35.375 --> 02:13:37.230
to take that position right there.

02:13:37.230 --> 02:13:39.227
TALIESIN: The bear is at the back cell.

02:13:39.227 --> 02:13:40.692
LAURA: Scanlan, where are you?

02:13:40.692 --> 02:13:42.994
SAM: There's voices coming from the stairs?

02:13:42.994 --> 02:13:44.619
LIAM: Yeah, someone's coming.

02:13:44.619 --> 02:13:45.779
SAM: But there's a bear in the stairs.

02:13:45.779 --> 02:13:47.026
LAURA: Well, Trinket's coming down.

02:13:47.026 --> 02:13:48.212
MARISHA: I call,

02:13:48.212 --> 02:13:50.954
“Trinket, Trinket, Trinket (kissing SFX) Trinket!”

02:13:50.954 --> 02:13:52.345
MATT: Trinket barely hears you from way over at the side.

02:13:52.345 --> 02:13:53.702
MARISHA: (kissing SFX) Come on.

02:13:53.702 --> 02:13:54.983
MATT: He's coming into this room.

02:13:54.983 --> 02:13:59.905
Clarota just steps back, along the side 
of the stairs and out of view.

02:14:02.195 --> 02:14:07.743
A few moments pass as the footsteps slowly trail off.

02:14:09.945 --> 02:14:12.676
ORION: I leave and turn around where Vex and Vax are.

02:14:12.676 --> 02:14:13.667
MARISHA: I know.

02:14:13.667 --> 02:14:16.051
LAURA: What's in the other door?

02:14:19.178 --> 02:14:22.824
MATT: The other door is currently locked 
from what you can tell.

02:14:22.824 --> 02:14:25.079
LIAM: One moment.

02:14:25.079 --> 02:14:27.359
It is now not locked, I think.

02:14:27.359 --> 02:14:28.477
MATT: (chuckles)

02:14:28.477 --> 02:14:29.870
LIAM: 25?

02:14:29.870 --> 02:14:36.523
MATT: (clicking SFX) You push the door open 
and you see immediately,

02:14:36.523 --> 02:14:43.073
the fast moving heft of some large blade towards your head.

02:14:43.073 --> 02:14:44.778
SAM: Oh, snap!

02:14:44.778 --> 02:14:45.944
LAURA: Oh, it's Kima.

02:14:45.944 --> 02:14:47.742
LIAM: No, it's a trap ready to hit me.

02:14:47.742 --> 02:14:50.536
MATT: That is 24 versus armor class.

02:14:50.536 --> 02:14:51.668
LIAM: That hits.

02:14:51.668 --> 02:14:53.137
MATT: That hits, all right.

02:14:53.137 --> 02:14:54.618
LAURA: Oh, you didn't check for traps.
LIAM: Didn't check for traps.

02:14:54.618 --> 02:14:55.771
TRAVIS: I thought you were good at this shit.

02:14:55.771 --> 02:14:56.977
LIAM: I'm going to use uncanny dodge.

02:14:56.977 --> 02:15:00.071
MATT: What would have been 20 points of 
slashing damage is reduced to 10.

02:15:00.071 --> 02:15:03.411
So you take 10 damage as the axe (impact SFX)

02:15:03.411 --> 02:15:06.335
hits you and imbeds itself in the wooden door, pulls back.

02:15:06.335 --> 02:15:10.056
Now you see as a duergar wearing this nasty-looking

02:15:10.056 --> 02:15:13.477
black leather tunic with a hood pulled back,

02:15:13.477 --> 02:15:19.417
with a giant, gnarled, hefted greataxe,

02:15:19.417 --> 02:15:22.108
words escaped me on that one,

02:15:22.108 --> 02:15:24.009
has a bunch of scars on its face.

02:15:24.009 --> 02:15:26.584
As it's grinning, it pulls the axe out of the doorway.

02:15:26.584 --> 02:15:28.916
LIAM: Right, I spit on the ground, and yank my belt off

02:15:28.916 --> 02:15:30.230
and throw it at his head.

02:15:30.230 --> 02:15:31.591
LAURA: And I yell ‘hold.’

02:15:31.591 --> 02:15:34.076
MATT: Okay. As you throw the belt--

02:15:34.076 --> 02:15:35.451
SAM: Hold?

02:15:35.451 --> 02:15:36.850
LAURA: Yeah, tell him to stop attacking.

02:15:36.850 --> 02:15:37.985
LIAM: Yeah, serpent.

02:15:37.985 --> 02:15:40.763
MATT: --he ducks out of the way,

02:15:43.917 --> 02:15:46.799
pulls back out of the way, as the snake forms itself.

02:15:46.799 --> 02:15:47.995
It goes ahead and makes its attack.

02:15:47.995 --> 02:15:50.433
Go ahead and roll for snake attack against him.

02:15:50.433 --> 02:15:52.098
SAM: Snake attack!

02:15:52.098 --> 02:15:54.318
LIAM: Okay, 12 plus, I don't know what, 12.

02:15:54.318 --> 02:15:55.802
Is my attack, his attack, snake attack?

02:15:55.802 --> 02:15:56.699
MATT: Did you roll a 12 on that?

02:15:56.699 --> 02:15:57.422
LIAM: Yeah.

02:15:57.422 --> 02:15:58.986
MATT: Okay, that will not hit unfortunately.

02:15:58.986 --> 02:15:59.808
LIAM: All right.

02:15:59.808 --> 02:16:02.260
MATT: As he slaps it off himself and it (swish SFX)

02:16:02.260 --> 02:16:03.711
cascades off to the side of the room.

02:16:03.711 --> 02:16:05.004
ASHLEY: Is he in a cell?

02:16:05.004 --> 02:16:07.561
TRAVIS: Is a base attack a straight line from him to Vax to--

02:16:07.561 --> 02:16:08.857
SAM: He's protecting the cells.

02:16:08.857 --> 02:16:10.184
ASHLEY: He's protecting the cells.

02:16:10.184 --> 02:16:11.539
MATT: At which point he kicks the door closed again.

02:16:11.539 --> 02:16:13.599
TRAVIS: Can I, in my rage, bullrush through this?

02:16:13.599 --> 02:16:14.896
SAM: Yes, yes.

02:16:14.896 --> 02:16:18.421
MATT: Now roll initiative, guys.

02:16:18.423 --> 02:16:20.303
ORION: As he's going I immediately cast

02:16:20.303 --> 02:16:22.220
Stone Skin on myself. (cracking SFX)

02:16:22.220 --> 02:16:23.552
MATT: Okay.

02:16:28.172 --> 02:16:30.978
LIAM: What I like is that there are 8 of us and 1 of him.

02:16:30.978 --> 02:16:32.641
LAURA: Possibly, if no one else is behind that door.

02:16:32.641 --> 02:16:33.630
TALIESIN: So far.

02:16:33.630 --> 02:16:35.483
LAURA: He's in a room by himself.

02:16:35.483 --> 02:16:37.565
LIAM: I can see the square, it's very small.

02:16:39.366 --> 02:16:42.665
MATT: You've looked inside, seeing a brief bit of the room.

02:16:42.665 --> 02:16:43.700
25 to 20?

02:16:43.700 --> 02:16:44.571
TALIESIN: 26.

02:16:44.571 --> 02:16:45.661
LIAM: 20.

02:16:45.661 --> 02:16:47.077
MATT: 26, all right Percy.

02:16:47.077 --> 02:16:49.728
LIAM: (shooting SFX)

02:16:52.782 --> 02:16:54.382
MATT: All right. 20 to 15?

02:16:54.382 --> 02:16:55.409
MARISHA: 18.

02:16:55.409 --> 02:16:56.415
LAURA: 15.

02:16:56.415 --> 02:16:57.665
ORION: 19.

02:17:02.916 --> 02:17:04.532
MATT: 15 to 10?

02:17:04.532 --> 02:17:05.945
TRAVIS: 14.

02:17:05.945 --> 02:17:06.826
MATT: 14.

02:17:07.877 --> 02:17:08.887
10 to 5?

02:17:08.887 --> 02:17:09.885
ASHLEY: 7.

02:17:12.219 --> 02:17:13.034
MATT: 5 to 1?

02:17:13.034 --> 02:17:14.517
SAM: (nervously) 4.

02:17:16.098 --> 02:17:17.522
MATT: All right. Percy, you're up first.

02:17:17.522 --> 02:17:19.964
TALIESIN: Where am I?

02:17:19.964 --> 02:17:21.539
MATT: You are way back in this cell, and you hear

02:17:21.539 --> 02:17:25.177
a slam of broken wood and another slam of a door closing.

02:17:25.177 --> 02:17:28.044
TALIESIN: I'm going to run to the hall.

02:17:28.044 --> 02:17:29.711
MATT: Make an acrobatics check to try and move

02:17:29.711 --> 02:17:31.341
through this cluster of people here.

02:17:31.341 --> 02:17:32.725
TALIESIN: I can do that.

02:17:34.385 --> 02:17:35.643
24.

02:17:35.643 --> 02:17:39.312
MATT: 24. You leap over, vaulting off of Trinket,

02:17:39.312 --> 02:17:41.520
land and move into this hallway.

02:17:41.520 --> 02:17:43.122
And that's the extent of your movement.

02:17:43.122 --> 02:17:47.332
TALIESIN: Okay, I'm going to try and take 
a shot and blow the lock.

02:17:47.332 --> 02:17:49.474
MATT: Okay, with the Bad News or with your--?

02:17:49.474 --> 02:17:50.597
TALIESIN: Oh no, Bad News is away.

02:17:50.597 --> 02:17:52.562
This is just with the handheld,

02:17:54.202 --> 02:17:56.172
shooting at the lock at the door.

02:17:56.172 --> 02:17:57.744
MATT: Okay, go for it.

02:17:59.358 --> 02:18:02.912
TALIESIN: Jesus H, 30.

02:18:02.912 --> 02:18:04.971
MATT: Go ahead and roll damage.

02:18:10.249 --> 02:18:11.806
TALIESIN: 9 points of damage.

02:18:11.806 --> 02:18:13.222
MATT: 9 points of damage.

02:18:13.222 --> 02:18:15.880
As the door slams back and you prepare yourself

02:18:15.880 --> 02:18:19.087
to try and kick it open, you hear the familiar (zoom SFX)

02:18:19.087 --> 02:18:20.772
of one of Percy's pepperbox bullets

02:18:20.772 --> 02:18:23.137
as the actual handle of the door (impact SFX)

02:18:23.137 --> 02:18:26.237
gets blown off and there's a small hole 
in the wooden door now

02:18:26.237 --> 02:18:28.321
where its handle once was.

02:18:28.321 --> 02:18:32.357
The door swings open a little bit 
loosely due to the impact.

02:18:32.357 --> 02:18:34.056
That ends your turn.

02:18:34.056 --> 02:18:35.285
TALIESIN: That ends my turn.

02:18:35.285 --> 02:18:36.379
MATT: Vax, you're up.

02:18:36.379 --> 02:18:38.717
LIAM: Okay. All I'm gonna do is grab the hole of the door

02:18:38.717 --> 02:18:40.637
and yank it open and yell,

02:18:40.637 --> 02:18:42.877
“Your turn, Grog!”

02:18:42.877 --> 02:18:45.147
MARISHA: Oh! That's fun!

02:18:47.205 --> 02:18:53.446
MATT: As you pull it open, the dwarf backs up

02:18:53.446 --> 02:18:55.214
over what you can see now,

02:18:55.214 --> 02:18:58.204
this room is completely covered in a series

02:18:58.204 --> 02:19:02.746
of really nasty, hooked instruments.

02:19:02.746 --> 02:19:06.506
Hot irons, you can see large pincers--

02:19:06.506 --> 02:19:07.925
TRAVIS: (laughs excitedly)

02:19:07.925 --> 02:19:09.341
MATT: --you can see various blades.

02:19:09.341 --> 02:19:10.469
ASHLEY: Oh, it's like a torture chamber?

02:19:10.469 --> 02:19:11.484
MATT: It's a torture chamber.

02:19:11.484 --> 02:19:12.430
(all groan)

02:19:12.430 --> 02:19:13.783
TRAVIS: It's Christmas!

02:19:13.783 --> 02:19:15.203
TALIESIN: Grog is running into Toys R Us.

02:19:15.203 --> 02:19:16.751
This is going to be great.

02:19:16.751 --> 02:19:19.839
MATT: You see gently as he backs away

02:19:19.839 --> 02:19:24.403
there is someone on this rack-like table.

02:19:24.404 --> 02:19:27.910
The dwarf backs up with his axe getting ready.

02:19:27.910 --> 02:19:29.491
LIAM: I use my bonus action to say,

02:19:29.491 --> 02:19:31.644
“You are so fucked, dwarf.”

02:19:31.644 --> 02:19:34.567
(all laugh)

02:19:34.567 --> 02:19:37.506
MATT: All right, that brings us to Tiberius.

02:19:37.506 --> 02:19:41.677
ORION: I like where this is going, Vax.

02:19:41.677 --> 02:19:44.046
Wait, I go over there first and then I say that.

02:19:44.046 --> 02:19:45.855
(all laugh)

02:19:45.855 --> 02:19:46.949
MATT: Acrobatics check.

02:19:46.949 --> 02:19:48.005
ORION: Acrobatics, why?

02:19:48.005 --> 02:19:49.092
SAM: You gotta jump over people.

02:19:49.092 --> 02:19:50.242
MATT: You've got to move through people.

02:19:50.242 --> 02:19:51.633
The area is congested.

02:19:51.633 --> 02:19:53.303
Small spaces, man.

02:19:53.303 --> 02:19:54.935
Downside of a big party.

02:19:54.935 --> 02:19:57.923
ORION: Okay. 22.

02:19:57.923 --> 02:20:00.664
MATT: 22. You manage to move through, 
push the bear out of the way.

02:20:00.664 --> 02:20:03.781
Move, Trinket. Get out the way!

02:20:03.781 --> 02:20:05.079
ORION: (muttering) Bear!

02:20:05.079 --> 02:20:06.813
MATT: You manage to make your way, 
squeeze past Percy.

02:20:06.813 --> 02:20:08.680
ORION: The bear surprisingly smells really nice.

02:20:08.680 --> 02:20:11.848
MATT: All right, Tiberius, what do 
you want to do now?

02:20:11.848 --> 02:20:16.509
ORION: I'm going to follow suit as 
I see what Vax is doing.

02:20:16.509 --> 02:20:18.735
I'm going to cast Hold Person on the dwarf.

02:20:18.735 --> 02:20:20.560
MATT: You don't have visual on the 
dwarf currently, the dwarf is back--

02:20:20.560 --> 02:20:22.135
ORION: What? That's absurd!

02:20:22.135 --> 02:20:24.747
MATT: As you run through the hallway - 
which you don't know there's a dwarf there -

02:20:24.747 --> 02:20:26.632
you rush out to the hallway after hearing 
all this commotion.

02:20:26.632 --> 02:20:28.675
You look in and there's an open door into 
a room that's currently vacant.

02:20:28.675 --> 02:20:31.460
You don't have enough movement to 
get close enough, unfortunately.

02:20:31.460 --> 02:20:33.326
ORION: Oh well, poop.

02:20:33.326 --> 02:20:35.913
I... I encourage violence.

02:20:35.913 --> 02:20:38.310
(all laugh)

02:20:38.310 --> 02:20:40.194
MATT: A wondrous use of an action.

02:20:40.194 --> 02:20:43.249
ORION: Do it! Do it, Grog!

02:20:43.249 --> 02:20:45.845
Destroy them!

02:20:45.845 --> 02:20:47.304
With no regard to any of his existence.

02:20:47.304 --> 02:20:48.928
MATT: Keyleth.

02:20:48.928 --> 02:20:50.595
TRAVIS: (laughing) I encourage violence!

02:20:50.595 --> 02:20:52.282
LIAM: That's the best line of the night! (laughs)

02:20:57.041 --> 02:20:59.404
MATT: You are currently in a cell with

02:20:59.404 --> 02:21:01.426
a dead body draped over you.

02:21:01.426 --> 02:21:03.550
(all laughing)

02:21:03.550 --> 02:21:05.475
MARISHA: It's cozy down here.

02:21:05.475 --> 02:21:06.998
Okay, so with the dead body,

02:21:06.998 --> 02:21:08.592
I hear what's going on -

02:21:12.062 --> 02:21:14.216
we're roleplaying it up!

02:21:14.216 --> 02:21:16.334
ORION: Get the body off of you.

02:21:16.334 --> 02:21:18.670
MARISHA: I morph into Minxy form.

02:21:18.670 --> 02:21:19.786
TRAVIS: Minxy!

02:21:19.786 --> 02:21:21.566
MARISHA: And as I morph into Minxy form,

02:21:21.566 --> 02:21:23.456
I take the dead body that's on top of me and

02:21:23.456 --> 02:21:25.895
just pick it up with my mouth.

02:21:28.225 --> 02:21:30.630
MATT: In your mouth, the body stirs.

02:21:30.630 --> 02:21:32.757
It wasn't quite dead.

02:21:32.757 --> 02:21:33.964
MARISHA: Oh, why?!

02:21:33.964 --> 02:21:35.251
LAURA: (Gasps) Oh, Keyleth!

02:21:35.251 --> 02:21:37.246
MARISHA: It was supposed to be - 
I wanted the dead one.

02:21:37.246 --> 02:21:38.298
TRAVIS: Minxy says I'm sorry!

02:21:38.298 --> 02:21:39.805
MARISHA: Can I drop that one and find a dead one?

02:21:39.805 --> 02:21:41.274
MATT: Well, you wanted a dead one. It is now.

02:21:41.274 --> 02:21:42.026
ALL: Oh!

02:21:42.026 --> 02:21:43.631
MARISHA: That's fine, that's fine.

02:21:43.631 --> 02:21:45.190
LIAM: Oh, murdering children again.

02:21:45.190 --> 02:21:47.560
TALIESIN: Spend the entire game being the 
worst person in the world.

02:21:47.560 --> 02:21:50.251
MARISHA: I know! I try so hard, you guys!

02:21:50.251 --> 02:21:51.474
TRAVIS: Was it a child duergar?

02:21:51.474 --> 02:21:54.830
MARISHA: I try so hard, I'm still the fucking worst!

02:21:54.830 --> 02:21:59.857
MATT: So, you now have a dead, gaunt dwarf,

02:21:59.857 --> 02:22:01.069
hanging from Minxy's mouth.

02:22:01.069 --> 02:22:02.425
(all laugh)

02:22:02.425 --> 02:22:04.986
MATT: What do you want to do?

02:22:04.986 --> 02:22:06.378
SAM: Keep chewing.

02:22:06.378 --> 02:22:08.943
MARISHA: Um, it was...

02:22:08.943 --> 02:22:11.582
TRAVIS: Oh, go ahead, do something else.

02:22:11.582 --> 02:22:14.079
TALIESIN: At least it's not gamey, it’s fresh.

02:22:14.079 --> 02:22:18.701
MARISHA: Keyleth tries. Keyleth tries so hard.

02:22:18.701 --> 02:22:20.385
ORION: You're not trying hard enough, damn it!

02:22:20.385 --> 02:22:23.911
MARISHA: Fuck you man, all right? 
I'm having a tough day.

02:22:23.911 --> 02:22:25.405
TRAVIS: You hear a little dwarf in the corner go:

02:22:25.405 --> 02:22:26.189
"Mommy?"

02:22:26.189 --> 02:22:27.743
MARISHA: Vex brought up the fact that I killed a kid.

02:22:27.743 --> 02:22:30.553
I’m having all these memories coming back, I'm on the brink.

02:22:30.553 --> 02:22:33.096
MATT: Yeah, there's some PTSD coming through.

02:22:33.096 --> 02:22:36.592
MARISHA: So I've got this now-dead corpse in my mouth

02:22:36.592 --> 02:22:39.679
and I come out around the corner.

02:22:39.679 --> 02:22:41.274
MATT: Make an Acrobatics check.

02:22:41.274 --> 02:22:42.673
Because you’re still moving through 
this clustered hallway

02:22:42.673 --> 02:22:43.932
with a dead dwarf in your mouth.

02:22:43.932 --> 02:22:44.884
LIAM: Holy cow!

02:22:44.884 --> 02:22:46.522
MARISHA: I'm a tiger so--

02:22:46.522 --> 02:22:49.493
LIAM: That was Greyspine's cousin.

02:22:49.493 --> 02:22:51.726
MARISHA: Can I have an advantage?

02:22:51.726 --> 02:22:54.619
Oh, I rolled a 15. Plus being a tiger?

02:22:54.619 --> 02:22:58.683
MATT: You're fine. You manage to push through, 
you're leaping through.

02:22:58.683 --> 02:23:01.213
MARISHA: I'm pouncy. And I come out into the hallway.

02:23:01.213 --> 02:23:03.793
MATT: You actually shift Tiberius out of the way.

02:23:03.793 --> 02:23:05.210
This is a very small space, you're a very big cat.

02:23:05.210 --> 02:23:06.740
You're really pushing for space here.

02:23:06.740 --> 02:23:08.136
MARISHA: Move!

02:23:08.136 --> 02:23:11.143
MATT: It's very, very tight quarters for you, you're like - 
(struggling SFX)

02:23:11.143 --> 02:23:14.263
ORION: Keyleth, as a cat, you smell less good as 
Trinket does.

02:23:14.263 --> 02:23:16.074
MARISHA: It's not me, it's the dead body.

02:23:16.074 --> 02:23:17.825
ORION: Oh. That's disgusting.

02:23:17.825 --> 02:23:19.924
MARISHA: And I look at the dwarf.

02:23:19.924 --> 02:23:21.295
MATT: You can't see him from your vantage point,

02:23:21.295 --> 02:23:23.862
he's actually back out of sight.

02:23:23.862 --> 02:23:25.319
ORION: I can't see him, you can't see him.

02:23:25.319 --> 02:23:27.183
MARISHA: No? Can I shift to see him at all?

02:23:27.183 --> 02:23:28.378
MATT: You don't know there's a dwarf there.

02:23:28.378 --> 02:23:29.348
You just know there's some sort of commotion

02:23:29.348 --> 02:23:30.568
going on. You move around the corner

02:23:30.568 --> 02:23:31.407
and you see just an empty room.

02:23:31.407 --> 02:23:32.394
LIAM: Everybody give up your turn to Grog.

02:23:32.394 --> 02:23:33.421
LAURA: I know, let him go in the room.

02:23:33.421 --> 02:23:34.373
ORION: Just let Grog deal with this butthole.

02:23:34.373 --> 02:23:35.519
MARISHA: I look at Grog and I foam at the mouth

02:23:35.519 --> 02:23:37.536
a little bit with the corpse and I--

02:23:37.536 --> 02:23:38.398
SAM: Encourage violence.

02:23:38.398 --> 02:23:39.607
MARISHA: --I encourage violence.

02:23:39.607 --> 02:23:40.600
(all laugh)

02:23:40.600 --> 02:23:43.706
MATT: All right. Vex?

02:23:43.706 --> 02:23:45.008
MARISHA: Just gnawing on the dead dwarf.

02:23:45.008 --> 02:23:46.718
LAURA: Oh, well, let's make this nice and easy.

02:23:46.718 --> 02:23:48.430
I smack Grog on the ass and say,

02:23:48.430 --> 02:23:49.538
"Go get him".

02:23:49.538 --> 02:23:50.824
TRAVIS: (eager snarling)

02:23:50.824 --> 02:23:51.835
MATT: All right, Grog, it's your turn.

02:23:51.835 --> 02:23:53.441
TRAVIS: (eager snarling continues)

02:23:53.441 --> 02:23:56.654
MARISHA: Does he get advantage because

02:23:56.654 --> 02:23:58.667
we're all encouraging violence?

02:23:58.667 --> 02:23:59.544
ORION: Yeah, or inspiration?

02:23:59.544 --> 02:24:02.251
MATT: Oh no, you get inspiration dice for this whole set up.

02:24:02.251 --> 02:24:03.610
1d8 inspiration dice.

02:24:03.610 --> 02:24:04.836
SAM: You don't kill him in one shot,

02:24:04.836 --> 02:24:06.596
it's very very disappointing.

02:24:06.596 --> 02:24:07.925
MATT: All right, you run in.

02:24:07.925 --> 02:24:09.140
TRAVIS: You said the room was full of shiny

02:24:09.140 --> 02:24:10.369
pointy things on the wall, right?

02:24:10.369 --> 02:24:11.085
MATT: Yes.

02:24:11.085 --> 02:24:12.884
TRAVIS: I would like to bull rush the dwarf up

02:24:12.884 --> 02:24:14.924
and against the wall, try and spear him

02:24:14.924 --> 02:24:16.612
with all the sharp shit on the wall.

02:24:16.612 --> 02:24:17.522
MATT: Okay!

02:24:17.522 --> 02:24:18.986
ALL: (cheering)

02:24:21.786 --> 02:24:27.969
MATT: Oh, that's nasty. Okay then, so for the-- (laughs)

02:24:27.969 --> 02:24:30.098
LIAM: Instant karma's going to get you, man.

02:24:30.098 --> 02:24:32.325
MATT: All right, so go ahead and make an athletics check.

02:24:32.325 --> 02:24:33.783
LIAM: You hear that, Keyleth?

02:24:33.783 --> 02:24:35.467
MARISHA: (growling)

02:24:35.467 --> 02:24:37.186
TRAVIS: 24.

02:24:37.186 --> 02:24:39.934
MATT: Yeah, against his 7.

02:24:39.934 --> 02:24:44.701
You rush in and with your first attack, 
you grab him, lift him,

02:24:44.701 --> 02:24:46.889
and you can see there's a series of giant meat hooks

02:24:46.889 --> 02:24:48.319
hanging from the back of the wall,

02:24:48.319 --> 02:24:50.560
and you just lift him up and (impaling SFX)

02:24:50.560 --> 02:24:52.115
shove him down onto the hook which protrudes

02:24:52.115 --> 02:24:54.678
from the front of his chest. (gurgling SFX)

02:24:54.678 --> 02:24:58.838
TRAVIS: No, perfect. Tell me I get another attack.

02:24:58.838 --> 02:25:00.029
MATT: You do.

02:25:00.029 --> 02:25:01.490
TRAVIS: Excellent!

02:25:01.490 --> 02:25:03.124
MATT: That's 12 points of damage and he's

02:25:03.124 --> 02:25:07.317
currently restrained by the hook through his chest.

02:25:07.317 --> 02:25:08.653
LAURA: Impaled? Oh!

02:25:08.653 --> 02:25:10.293
TRAVIS: Perfect! With my second attack 
as he's screaming out

02:25:10.293 --> 02:25:14.770
I reach inside, grab his lower jaw and 
pull him straight down.

02:25:14.770 --> 02:25:16.400
MATT: Okay, make an attack roll.

02:25:16.400 --> 02:25:19.532
LAURA: Oh no! That's so gross.

02:25:19.532 --> 02:25:21.092
ASHLEY: Oh, I love this so much.

02:25:21.092 --> 02:25:24.068
LIAM: Vax is using his free hand to cover his eyes.

02:25:24.068 --> 02:25:25.864
SAM: Keyleth starts eating him.

02:25:25.864 --> 02:25:27.252
TRAVIS: (laughing) 24.

02:25:27.252 --> 02:25:29.547
MATT: (laughs) Go ahead and roll damage on this.

02:25:29.547 --> 02:25:30.480
LAURA: Oh, sick.

02:25:30.480 --> 02:25:31.883
TRAVIS: With a 12?

02:25:31.883 --> 02:25:36.234
MATT: For flavor, roll a 12. Why not? 
You're pulling his jaw.

02:25:36.234 --> 02:25:38.397
TRAVIS: Excellent! (laughing)

02:25:38.397 --> 02:25:39.547
ASHLEY: He rolled really high.

02:25:39.547 --> 02:25:40.928
TRAVIS: 15.

02:25:40.928 --> 02:25:46.031
MATT: After you throw him onto the hook,

02:25:46.031 --> 02:25:48.048
his axe clatters to the ground and he reaches up

02:25:48.048 --> 02:25:50.197
with his hands to grab you and it looks like

02:25:50.197 --> 02:25:52.352
he's pulling back to try and bring you in for a headbutt.

02:25:52.352 --> 02:25:55.671
This angry look of burning rage in his white eyes,

02:25:55.671 --> 02:25:59.121
this fucked-up duergar with all these scars on his face,

02:25:59.121 --> 02:26:00.474
as he reaches up towards you,

02:26:00.474 --> 02:26:04.173
you take your giant hand and jam it into his maw.

02:26:04.173 --> 02:26:06.060
With this horrible (choking SFX) sound,

02:26:06.060 --> 02:26:08.061
as you put all your muscle into it,

02:26:08.061 --> 02:26:10.737
glaring him in the face with a terrible grin you 
(breaking SFX)

02:26:10.737 --> 02:26:13.223
and yank the jaw off from the bottom of his head.

02:26:13.223 --> 02:26:15.318
ALL: (cheering)

02:26:15.318 --> 02:26:17.485
MATT: A spatter of blood across the front of his mouth

02:26:17.485 --> 02:26:20.983
and his tongue dangling, he gives out this horrible 
(gagging scream)

02:26:20.983 --> 02:26:22.817
this gurgling scream as all the blood begins

02:26:22.817 --> 02:26:24.769
to pour up into his throat.

02:26:24.769 --> 02:26:27.716
With that, clutching the jaw with one hand,

02:26:27.716 --> 02:26:30.561
you begin to pummel him in the face over and over,

02:26:30.561 --> 02:26:33.787
with his jaw, as he's watching, his head slowly cave in.

02:26:33.787 --> 02:26:35.071
TRAVIS: (laughing) Yes!

02:26:35.071 --> 02:26:36.442
SAM: I think he's going to make it.

02:26:36.442 --> 02:26:37.639
MATT: Until eventually, he's no longer moving

02:26:37.639 --> 02:26:39.861
and you throw the jaw to the ground, 
just coated with blood.

02:26:39.861 --> 02:26:41.158
LIAM: You're going to pull through, buddy.

02:26:41.158 --> 02:26:43.098
LAURA: Pike! I think Grog, um, I think he did his job.

02:26:43.098 --> 02:26:44.108
ASHLEY: I scream out,

02:26:44.108 --> 02:26:46.882
"Good job Grog! That's your best one yet!"

02:26:46.882 --> 02:26:49.058
MARISHA: And they say video games are violent.

02:26:49.058 --> 02:26:50.438
(all laugh)

02:26:50.438 --> 02:26:51.786
LAURA: (gagging sounds)

02:26:53.876 --> 02:26:55.344
MATT: As you've entered the room now--

02:26:55.344 --> 02:26:56.329
ASHLEY: Wait, is he dead?

02:26:56.329 --> 02:26:58.322
(all laugh)

02:26:58.322 --> 02:26:59.604
MATT: Oh, he's very dead.

02:26:59.604 --> 02:27:02.374
TRAVIS: We made cheese of him.

02:27:02.374 --> 02:27:04.236
MATT: He lies there limply on the wall,

02:27:04.236 --> 02:27:06.347
twitching every few seconds.

02:27:06.347 --> 02:27:08.324
Grog, still in a rage, you look over at the other individual.

02:27:08.324 --> 02:27:12.280
You can see now strapped to this wooden frame

02:27:12.280 --> 02:27:15.356
is a smallish humanoid, female,

02:27:15.356 --> 02:27:18.283
currently chained and being pulled on a rack.

02:27:18.283 --> 02:27:20.351
You can see bunch of scars and wounds,

02:27:20.351 --> 02:27:21.598
blood pouring from each one of them.

02:27:21.598 --> 02:27:22.635
SAM: Is that our girl?

02:27:22.635 --> 02:27:23.467
LAURA: That's our girl!

02:27:23.467 --> 02:27:25.123
TALIESIN: I'm running in. 
Do I know how to disable the rack?

02:27:25.123 --> 02:27:28.264
MATT: You can probably figure it out with a tinker.

02:27:28.264 --> 02:27:29.791
LIAM: Pike!
TRAVIS: Is it chains or rope?

02:27:29.791 --> 02:27:31.646
LAURA: Come heal her!
LIAM: We need Pike in here!

02:27:31.646 --> 02:27:33.392
TRAVIS: Is it chains or rope?
SAM: I'll go!

02:27:33.392 --> 02:27:35.298
MATT: It's chains holding her on.

02:27:35.298 --> 02:27:37.391
TALIESIN: I'm going to undo it.

02:27:37.391 --> 02:27:38.424
MATT: Okay.

02:27:38.424 --> 02:27:39.738
SAM: Wait. Do we know it's her?

02:27:39.738 --> 02:27:40.782
MATT: Go ahead and make a tinker check.

02:27:40.782 --> 02:27:41.869
LAURA: It's her. It's gotta be her.

02:27:41.869 --> 02:27:43.211
ORION: Whoever it is, we should help.

02:27:43.211 --> 02:27:44.530
TALIESIN: What do I add? 
Is it proficiency bonus?

02:27:44.530 --> 02:27:46.076
MATT: Proficiency bonus.

02:27:46.076 --> 02:27:47.430
TALIESIN: 12.

02:27:47.430 --> 02:27:48.498
MATT: 12?

02:27:48.498 --> 02:27:50.978
You take a moment and you manage to find

02:27:50.978 --> 02:27:51.926
where the winch to this machine is,

02:27:51.926 --> 02:27:53.067
where you can go ahead and release the tension

02:27:53.067 --> 02:27:54.792
and eventually the chains go a little more slack

02:27:54.792 --> 02:27:59.942
and (gasps) the halfling woman takes a deep breath

02:27:59.942 --> 02:28:01.224
and looks about the room a second,

02:28:01.224 --> 02:28:03.117
looks like there's a bit of a haze, but through the haze

02:28:03.117 --> 02:28:08.196
there's this constant anger and 
she looks down and goes:

02:28:08.196 --> 02:28:11.269
“So? Are you gonna let me go?

02:28:11.269 --> 02:28:13.731
“Come on! Release these chains!”

02:28:13.731 --> 02:28:15.233
ASHLEY: Who is she?

02:28:15.233 --> 02:28:16.591
TRAVIS: Wait, wait. Find out who she is first.

02:28:16.591 --> 02:28:19.380
LAURA: Can we insight and make sure that it's 
really who she--

02:28:19.380 --> 02:28:21.483
MATT: You can indeed.

02:28:21.483 --> 02:28:23.581
This is an insight check.

02:28:23.581 --> 02:28:26.745
LAURA: Great, I don't get any...

02:28:26.745 --> 02:28:29.261
Anybody else want to roll for insight?

02:28:29.261 --> 02:28:31.514
LIAM: 5, 1. Pike, roll well. The twins fucked it.

02:28:31.514 --> 02:28:33.624
ASHLEY: Insight?

02:28:33.636 --> 02:28:35.247
LIAM: Scanlan! Come up here!

02:28:35.247 --> 02:28:36.081
SAM: Yeah, yeah, oh.

02:28:36.081 --> 02:28:37.338
ASHLEY: 15! 15?

02:28:37.338 --> 02:28:40.269
LIAM: She's not in her right mind.

02:28:40.269 --> 02:28:41.716
MATT: It's a very small room, only a few people 
can make it in here.

02:28:41.716 --> 02:28:42.841
SAM: I'm gonna take a peek at her.

02:28:42.841 --> 02:28:44.150
What do I do? What do I roll?

02:28:44.150 --> 02:28:45.281
LIAM: Insight to see if she's in her right mind.

02:28:45.281 --> 02:28:46.349
ASHLEY: 15? 18 is better.

02:28:46.349 --> 02:28:49.373
MATT: At this point, it's pretty apparent that whatever

02:28:49.373 --> 02:28:53.023
this woman is, she's been here a while

02:28:53.023 --> 02:28:56.205
and has been subjected to many, many horrible things

02:28:56.205 --> 02:29:00.375
and still has that spark of life to her,

02:29:00.375 --> 02:29:03.843
mainly out of vengeance, anger, and pain,

02:29:03.843 --> 02:29:07.430
but she does not seem to be overtly aggressive 
or trying to deceive you;

02:29:07.430 --> 02:29:09.571
just trying to get out of these fucking chains.

02:29:09.571 --> 02:29:11.129
LAURA: Well, let's let her go.

02:29:11.129 --> 02:29:12.364
ORION: I'll do an Arcana check on her.

02:29:12.364 --> 02:29:14.557
MATT: What's that? Arcana check? To...?

02:29:14.557 --> 02:29:20.481
ORION: See if there's like any kind of magical impurities in her.

02:29:20.481 --> 02:29:21.863
TRAVIS: If she's under the Imperius Curse.

02:29:21.863 --> 02:29:23.121
MATT: Best you can tell, there's none.

02:29:23.121 --> 02:29:24.288
LIAM: I'm pulling out my lockpicks and

02:29:24.288 --> 02:29:25.690
I'm going to start working on--

02:29:25.690 --> 02:29:27.727
SAM: I'm going to heal her with a little bit of a song.

02:29:27.727 --> 02:29:30.250
LIAM: And you know my lockpick snaps so...

02:29:30.250 --> 02:29:31.712
just totally broken.

02:29:31.712 --> 02:29:34.014
ASHLEY: How hurt is she?

02:29:34.014 --> 02:29:35.432
SAM: If I may.

02:29:35.432 --> 02:29:37.576
MATT: She's pretty rough.

02:29:37.576 --> 02:29:40.576
As you look up, she's not clothed.

02:29:40.576 --> 02:29:48.663
Her body is just a spray of scars and 
gashes and rake marks.

02:29:48.663 --> 02:29:52.878
She's been tortured to an extent 
you hadn't seen in person,

02:29:52.878 --> 02:29:57.493
and to still be tensing her muscles against the chains

02:29:57.493 --> 02:30:00.329
and looking at you with this intensity,

02:30:00.329 --> 02:30:01.980
if this is indeed Lady Kima,

02:30:01.980 --> 02:30:04.518
you now see why she's made the reputation she has.

02:30:04.518 --> 02:30:07.343
LIAM: Grog, the locking mechanism on this is jammed.

02:30:07.343 --> 02:30:09.502
SAM: Okay. So, I step forward and I pull out my flute

02:30:09.502 --> 02:30:12.329
and I sing, (singing)

02:30:12.329 --> 02:30:16.391
"As long as I got my song and flute,

02:30:16.391 --> 02:30:19.776
“I'm gonna give some healing to you.

02:30:19.776 --> 02:30:22.395
“Love and magic in the air tonight,

02:30:22.395 --> 02:30:25.168
“gonna give you some hit points.

02:30:25.168 --> 02:30:27.918
“Gonna give you some hit points,

02:30:27.918 --> 02:30:32.638
“gonna give you some hit points of our love.”

02:30:32.638 --> 02:30:34.191
(all laugh)

02:30:34.191 --> 02:30:36.169
SAM: Dadadanana, okay.

02:30:36.169 --> 02:30:39.885
I roll 9 hit points.

02:30:39.885 --> 02:30:44.617
MATT: The fresher wounds seal up, the 
blood flow comes to a stop.

02:30:44.617 --> 02:30:47.105
You see her muscles tense for a moment -

02:30:47.105 --> 02:30:49.342
her tension in her muscles relax for a minute.

02:30:49.342 --> 02:30:51.247
She looks to you for a second and says,

02:30:51.247 --> 02:30:55.327
“It's been a while since I've heard a song. Thank you.”

02:30:55.327 --> 02:30:56.529
SAM: It was a slow jam.

02:30:56.529 --> 02:30:57.788
TALIESIN: Please be careful for a moment.

02:30:57.788 --> 02:30:59.641
Can someone cover her ears for just a second?

02:30:59.641 --> 02:31:00.890
TRAVIS: Yeah, I got it.

02:31:00.890 --> 02:31:01.975
ASHLEY: Earmuffs.

02:31:01.975 --> 02:31:03.776
TALIESIN: I'm going to utility shot -

02:31:03.776 --> 02:31:05.763
I'm going to put my gun against the lock,

02:31:05.763 --> 02:31:09.020
somewhere where it will not harm her and just blow it.

02:31:09.020 --> 02:31:12.231
MATT: Go ahead and roll damage.

02:31:12.231 --> 02:31:15.148
You don't have to roll to hit, it's right there.

02:31:17.573 --> 02:31:19.022
TALIESIN: 15.

02:31:19.022 --> 02:31:21.583
Is it two locks?

02:31:21.583 --> 02:31:25.020
MATT: Well, there's one chain for the legs, 
one chain for the arms.

02:31:25.020 --> 02:31:29.603
TALIESIN: Okay. 15 for the leg. 10 for the arm.

02:31:29.603 --> 02:31:31.393
MATT: (gunshot sound) The legs get free.

02:31:31.393 --> 02:31:35.125
(gunshot sound) The chain mostly 
snaps on the top part,

02:31:35.125 --> 02:31:36.563
but not quite enough.

02:31:36.563 --> 02:31:37.833
It's enough for you, Grog, to-

02:31:37.833 --> 02:31:39.695
TRAVIS: I got it! (snarling)

02:31:39.695 --> 02:31:41.356
MATT: You reach over and bring it down,

02:31:41.356 --> 02:31:42.881
with a brief moment of extreme tension

02:31:42.881 --> 02:31:44.625
as the whole room watches Grog walk up with his axe

02:31:44.625 --> 02:31:47.981
and swing it down towards this halfling.

02:31:47.981 --> 02:31:49.600
Before you have a moment to stop,

02:31:49.600 --> 02:31:51.441
everyone's heart skips a beat.

02:31:51.441 --> 02:31:52.953
The chain is bisected--

02:31:52.953 --> 02:31:54.666
LIAM: Ease down! Ease down.

02:31:54.666 --> 02:31:56.359
MATT: --at which point the halfling woman immediately

02:31:56.359 --> 02:31:58.063
jumps to her feet with almost like a kip-up stand

02:31:58.063 --> 02:32:02.071
and is now standing on top of the table.

02:32:02.071 --> 02:32:05.700
Her arms are still bound and she - (groans)

02:32:05.700 --> 02:32:07.823
You can now see where the metal was 
weakened from the axe blow.

02:32:07.823 --> 02:32:09.867
She (metal snapping SFX) pulls herself free

02:32:09.867 --> 02:32:11.271
from the metal binding--

02:32:11.271 --> 02:32:12.500
TRAVIS: That's hot.

02:32:12.500 --> 02:32:14.453
MATT: --there's a blister across her wrist,

02:32:14.453 --> 02:32:17.336
from how long she's been pulling 
against these restraints.

02:32:17.336 --> 02:32:19.063
But she bore through it, with a little bit of blood

02:32:19.063 --> 02:32:20.775
that trickles from that wound.

02:32:20.775 --> 02:32:23.963
She has freed herself and she looks 
around the rest of the group.

02:32:25.609 --> 02:32:27.979
“So, I take it you're not from around here?”

02:32:27.979 --> 02:32:30.832
ORION: No! Would you like some water?

02:32:30.832 --> 02:32:33.359
MATT: She grabs it from you, pulls off the cork

02:32:33.359 --> 02:32:35.857
and just starts chugging like she hasn't had anything

02:32:35.857 --> 02:32:37.350
to drink in a long time.

02:32:37.350 --> 02:32:39.079
LAURA: Lady Kima, we need to get you out of here.

02:32:39.079 --> 02:32:40.845
LIAM: Allura has sent us.

02:32:40.845 --> 02:32:43.830
MATT: She caps it off after a moment 
and takes a deep breath.

02:32:43.830 --> 02:32:50.068
“I'd hoped she would. It was foolish of me 
to come down here so unprepared.

02:32:50.068 --> 02:32:54.581
“Just knew there wasn't much time.” (chuckles)

02:32:54.581 --> 02:32:57.035
LIAM: Time 'til what?

02:32:57.035 --> 02:33:00.003
MATT: She looks around and says,

02:33:00.003 --> 02:33:02.758
“Look, we don't- it's a story. I have no--”

02:33:02.758 --> 02:33:05.101
And she kind of points to her pretty much

02:33:05.101 --> 02:33:07.837
unclothed, unarmored form, and says,

02:33:07.837 --> 02:33:11.212
“I need to find my implements. We need to get out of here.”

02:33:11.212 --> 02:33:14.663
TRAVIS: Could I offer to you this black, 
studded leather, dwarven armor?

02:33:14.663 --> 02:33:16.351
It's not leather, actually.

02:33:16.351 --> 02:33:18.199
LIAM: It's magical, it'll fit you.

02:33:18.199 --> 02:33:20.702
ORION: Would you care for this robe?

02:33:20.702 --> 02:33:22.223
LAURA: Which sounds better?

02:33:22.223 --> 02:33:24.066
MATT: What armor were you offering her?

02:33:24.066 --> 02:33:25.453
TRAVIS: It's the black, dwarven armor--

02:33:25.453 --> 02:33:26.915
LIAM: The armor that I found and gave to Grog.

02:33:26.915 --> 02:33:28.280
It's magical.

02:33:28.280 --> 02:33:29.643
MATT: Oh, the studded leather.

02:33:29.643 --> 02:33:30.646
LIAM: Yes.

02:33:30.646 --> 02:33:31.733
TRAVIS: It's in the bag.

02:33:31.733 --> 02:33:33.128
MATT: She goes, “Sure, it works for now.”

02:33:33.128 --> 02:33:34.370
She takes it from you and starts putting it on.

02:33:34.370 --> 02:33:35.488
You see her wincing as she puts it on,

02:33:35.488 --> 02:33:36.946
as it covers some of the wounds.

02:33:36.946 --> 02:33:39.094
Her whole body is just sore, but she still pushes through it.

02:33:39.094 --> 02:33:40.599
ASHLEY: I'm going to heal her a little bit more.

02:33:40.599 --> 02:33:41.608
MATT: Okay.

02:33:41.608 --> 02:33:42.933
ASHLEY: I'll put my hands on her.

02:33:42.933 --> 02:33:44.942
I'm sorry. You're not fully healed, let me help you out.

02:33:44.942 --> 02:33:46.411
TRAVIS: (quietly) Grog likes scars.

02:33:46.411 --> 02:33:49.483
MATT: As you do, she takes a moment and she says -

02:33:49.483 --> 02:33:50.932
You heal her and she goes,

02:33:50.932 --> 02:33:51.944
“Can I-”

02:33:51.944 --> 02:33:53.049
She sees your mace and goes,

02:33:53.049 --> 02:33:54.144
“Can I borrow that for a second?”

02:33:54.144 --> 02:33:55.146
ASHLEY: Uh...

02:33:55.146 --> 02:33:56.238
MATT: “Please?”

02:33:56.238 --> 02:33:57.162
ASHLEY: My mace?

02:33:57.162 --> 02:33:58.346
MATT: “Your mace, please.”

02:33:58.346 --> 02:33:59.865
ASHLEY: What do you need it for?

02:33:59.865 --> 02:34:01.964
(all laugh)

02:34:01.964 --> 02:34:03.388
TRAVIS: You can have mine.

02:34:03.388 --> 02:34:04.414
MATT: “Do you trust me?”

02:34:04.414 --> 02:34:06.967
ASHLEY: I don't know. This is all I have 
to protect myself.

02:34:06.967 --> 02:34:09.778
MATT: “You've come this far.”

02:34:09.778 --> 02:34:12.650
ORION: Grog has something for you.

02:34:12.650 --> 02:34:14.274
SAM: Say yes to life, Pike.

02:34:14.274 --> 02:34:16.168
ASHLEY: All right, well, I also have 
a morningstar, but this is--

02:34:16.168 --> 02:34:17.506
(all laugh)

02:34:17.506 --> 02:34:19.143
ASHLEY: Are you gonna give it back?

02:34:19.143 --> 02:34:22.124
MATT: As you hand it out, she grabs it from your hands--

02:34:22.124 --> 02:34:23.399
ASHLEY: That was rude.

02:34:23.399 --> 02:34:24.747
MATT: --walks to the edge of the table--

02:34:24.747 --> 02:34:25.874
ASHLEY: I don't like her.

02:34:25.874 --> 02:34:29.145
MATT: --stares at the dwarf that is 
currently hooked onto the wall.

02:34:29.145 --> 02:34:32.920
(angry yell) And with a yell, slams it right into his face,

02:34:32.920 --> 02:34:35.943
causing his head to explode against the back of the wall.

02:34:35.943 --> 02:34:38.131
Slams it again and again and again,

02:34:38.131 --> 02:34:41.632
and is just making hamburger of his entire body.

02:34:41.632 --> 02:34:44.209
The arm sloughs off and she's just going nuts.

02:34:44.209 --> 02:34:46.176
You can see her bludgeoning over and over again

02:34:46.176 --> 02:34:47.963
with a spray of gore on her.

02:34:47.963 --> 02:34:50.124
And there's this look of anger, frustration--

02:34:50.124 --> 02:34:51.279
LAURA: She's raging.

02:34:51.279 --> 02:34:53.445
MATT: --and a sick sense of joy a little bit in her eyes

02:34:53.445 --> 02:34:55.881
in how she's just tearing this dwarf apart.

02:34:55.881 --> 02:34:57.953
Eventually, after this frenzy, you're all taken aback,

02:34:57.953 --> 02:35:00.339
and she takes a moment. (heavy breathing)

02:35:00.339 --> 02:35:03.396
There is very little left recognizable of 
what once was a duergar.

02:35:03.396 --> 02:35:05.680
SAM: I notice a bulge in Grog's pants.

02:35:05.680 --> 02:35:07.264
(all laugh)

02:35:07.264 --> 02:35:12.231
ORION: I use my Mage Hand to slowly 
pick up my bottle of water...

02:35:12.231 --> 02:35:13.669
(all laugh)

02:35:13.669 --> 02:35:19.302
MATT: Okay. She takes the mace she borrowed 
from you. (splatter sound)

02:35:19.302 --> 02:35:20.747
ASHLEY: I'm sorry I questioned you.

02:35:20.747 --> 02:35:22.398
MATT: As she begins to hand it back to you,

02:35:22.398 --> 02:35:24.807
there's a slight flash of radiant energy that emanates

02:35:24.807 --> 02:35:27.259
from her hand, and it burns all of the blood

02:35:27.259 --> 02:35:29.907
that currently encapsulates the mace off,

02:35:29.907 --> 02:35:31.688
and hands it back to you.

02:35:31.688 --> 02:35:33.775
“Thank you. I needed that.”

02:35:33.775 --> 02:35:36.187
ASHLEY: You're very welcome. I'm sorry I questioned you.

02:35:36.187 --> 02:35:37.503
ORION: Give her something, Grog!

02:35:37.503 --> 02:35:38.720
Let her use one of your things!

02:35:38.720 --> 02:35:40.456
TRAVIS: That was amazing.

02:35:40.456 --> 02:35:41.636
(all laugh)

02:35:41.636 --> 02:35:43.424
ORION: Like, you know, give her one of your things, Grog.

02:35:43.424 --> 02:35:46.010
TRAVIS: Could I, um, would you like to touch my axe?

02:35:46.010 --> 02:35:47.443
(all laugh)

02:35:47.443 --> 02:35:49.975
MATT: “If you want to part with it, certainly.“

02:35:49.975 --> 02:35:52.403
TRAVIS: Oh, uh. (clears throat, sniffs)

02:35:52.403 --> 02:35:54.152
Maybe we should get out of here.

02:35:54.152 --> 02:35:56.535
(all laugh)

02:35:56.535 --> 02:35:58.659
TALIESIN: Why don't we collect your things?

02:35:58.659 --> 02:36:00.345
LAURA: Yeah, where are they? Do you know?

02:36:00.345 --> 02:36:01.752
TALIESIN: I would assume they're being stored upstairs.

02:36:01.752 --> 02:36:02.952
MATT: “I have no idea.

02:36:02.952 --> 02:36:04.100
“They're either in the vault or they're in the armory.”

02:36:04.100 --> 02:36:05.719
SAM: Vault or the armory?

02:36:05.719 --> 02:36:07.066
Those are places that we can go?

02:36:07.066 --> 02:36:08.349
LAURA: There's a vault?

02:36:08.349 --> 02:36:11.232
TALIESIN: Are there stairs in the room that we're in?

02:36:11.232 --> 02:36:12.457
MATT: “As far as I can tell, my--”

02:36:12.457 --> 02:36:14.288
LIAM: Lady Kima, are these things absolutely necessary?

02:36:14.288 --> 02:36:16.518
We have a secret entrance to this place.

02:36:16.518 --> 02:36:18.272
We could leave now.

02:36:18.272 --> 02:36:22.267
Are they of vital importance, the things you've lost?

02:36:22.267 --> 02:36:26.048
MATT: She thinks to herself for a second, and goes,

02:36:26.048 --> 02:36:28.696
“They are divine implements, gifted to me from

02:36:28.696 --> 02:36:30.709
“an avatar of Bahamut directly.

02:36:30.709 --> 02:36:34.259
“I feel, to leave them behind would 
be a partial failure to my quest.

02:36:34.259 --> 02:36:38.062
“Not to mention, that what we may face beyond this,

02:36:38.062 --> 02:36:39.725
“we'll need every bit of help we can get.”

02:36:39.725 --> 02:36:40.700
TRAVIS: Oh, shit.

02:36:40.700 --> 02:36:41.794
LIAM: Well, that's that then.

02:36:41.794 --> 02:36:42.962
ORION: You'll have a friend in us, that's for sure.

02:36:42.962 --> 02:36:44.178
LAURA: Let's find the frigging vault!

02:36:44.178 --> 02:36:45.872
TALIESIN: Let's go upstairs.
LIAM: Let's go to the vault! Let's go upstairs.

02:36:45.872 --> 02:36:46.991
MATT: As you show the back of that card,

02:36:46.991 --> 02:36:48.301
she gives you a look and smiles and says,

02:36:48.301 --> 02:36:50.910
“Ah. It's good to see that your scale of color

02:36:50.910 --> 02:36:52.329
“does not belie your intent.

02:36:52.329 --> 02:36:57.508
“That is a face I've not seen for some time. 
I thank you.”

02:36:57.508 --> 02:37:01.146
She leaps off the table.

02:37:01.146 --> 02:37:04.876
“So.” (sighs) “Shall we?”

02:37:07.136 --> 02:37:09.270
SAM: Do you know where the vault is?

02:37:09.270 --> 02:37:10.412
MATT: “I can show you.”

02:37:10.412 --> 02:37:11.363
LAURA: (whispering) Yes!

02:37:11.363 --> 02:37:12.406
SAM: Lead the way!

02:37:12.406 --> 02:37:13.794
MARISHA: I go up to her, still in my Minxy form,

02:37:13.794 --> 02:37:18.254
and I rub on her legs.

02:37:18.254 --> 02:37:20.049
TALIESIN: Have you dropped the body yet?

02:37:20.049 --> 02:37:21.780
TRAVIS: I get right up behind them too, competing for space.

02:37:21.780 --> 02:37:22.935
TALIESIN: Are you dragging a dead body around?

02:37:22.935 --> 02:37:24.202
MARISHA: No, I dropped the body.

02:37:24.202 --> 02:37:25.613
While she was talking, I took the body,

02:37:25.613 --> 02:37:28.372
and I drug it back, and I buried my shame.

02:37:28.372 --> 02:37:32.469
(all laugh)

02:37:32.469 --> 02:37:34.269
MARISHA: So, first, I buried my shame.

02:37:34.269 --> 02:37:35.773
MATT: Your shame has been sufficiently buried.

02:37:35.773 --> 02:37:37.319
(laughter continues)

02:37:37.319 --> 02:37:38.701
ORION: Hashtag bury your shame.

02:37:38.701 --> 02:37:43.576
MARISHA: And I purr.

02:37:43.576 --> 02:37:45.548
MATT: She doesn't look at you,

02:37:45.548 --> 02:37:47.337
but she pats you absentmindedly as she passes you,

02:37:47.337 --> 02:37:50.726
her direct intent on heading back up those stairs herself.

02:37:50.726 --> 02:37:51.930
LAURA: All right.

02:37:51.930 --> 02:37:53.376
SAM: Let's go, but should we unlock all the other dwarves?

02:37:53.376 --> 02:37:55.035
LAURA: Yes, let's let all the other dwarves out,

02:37:55.035 --> 02:37:58.140
and maybe give them some food to 
try to help them out, if we can.

02:37:58.140 --> 02:38:00.871
TRAVIS: In the meantime, I have a greatsword

02:38:00.871 --> 02:38:03.510
or a morningstar mace that you can have

02:38:03.510 --> 02:38:06.043
until we find your items.

02:38:06.043 --> 02:38:07.163
MATT: “Greatsword.”

02:38:07.163 --> 02:38:09.339
TRAVIS: Greatsword it is.

02:38:09.339 --> 02:38:11.952
MATT: She takes it from you, and the sword is

02:38:11.952 --> 02:38:14.892
a little over a foot taller than she is.

02:38:14.892 --> 02:38:16.758
Maybe a little more than that.

02:38:16.758 --> 02:38:17.743
LAURA: She's really fricking buff.

02:38:17.743 --> 02:38:20.253
MATT: But as you hand it to her, she 
still takes it, and you can see--

02:38:20.253 --> 02:38:21.597
LIAM: She's a ripped halfling.
LAURA: That's pretty badass.

02:38:21.597 --> 02:38:22.728
MATT: --she is a built halfling female.

02:38:22.728 --> 02:38:25.943
She has seen some war, and she 
has survived some shit.

02:38:25.943 --> 02:38:27.625
LIAM: She's the Tyler Durden of halflings.

02:38:27.625 --> 02:38:28.792
(all laugh)

02:38:28.792 --> 02:38:30.537
MATT: Kind of, yeah.

02:38:30.537 --> 02:38:31.808
TRAVIS: As I see her grab the sword, I ask,

02:38:31.808 --> 02:38:33.382
“Would you care for some ale?”

02:38:33.382 --> 02:38:35.025
(all laugh)

02:38:35.025 --> 02:38:37.123
MATT: She glances over her shoulder 
at you, and says,

02:38:37.123 --> 02:38:39.259
“Later. We have nothing to celebrate for yet.”

02:38:39.259 --> 02:38:41.093
TRAVIS: Absolutely. Plenty of time!

02:38:41.093 --> 02:38:43.010
(all laugh)

02:38:43.010 --> 02:38:44.530
LIAM: I think Grog is smitten!

02:38:44.530 --> 02:38:46.061
LAURA: She comes to your knee.

02:38:46.061 --> 02:38:47.158
LIAM: Oh my goodness!

02:38:47.158 --> 02:38:49.792
LAURA: Can I run in the little prison, 
and tell the dwarves,

02:38:49.792 --> 02:38:51.487
if they are conscious, to say,

02:38:51.487 --> 02:38:53.806
“Don't exit from where you came.

02:38:53.806 --> 02:38:55.730
“There's a secret entrance up and in a store room.

02:38:55.730 --> 02:38:57.325
“Go that way, and stealth out.”

02:38:57.325 --> 02:39:00.246
MATT: One of the ones that was semi-conscious--

02:39:00.246 --> 02:39:01.949
LAURA: All of that, I say all of it.

02:39:01.949 --> 02:39:04.588
MATT: He sits up and looks at-- (laughs)

02:39:04.588 --> 02:39:05.802
That's fucked up.

02:39:05.802 --> 02:39:07.937
Sits up and looks back at you and - (ragged breathing)

02:39:07.937 --> 02:39:09.892
“Thank ye. Thank ye kindly.”

02:39:09.892 --> 02:39:11.219
LAURA: Here's some cheese!

02:39:11.219 --> 02:39:12.378
(all laugh)

02:39:12.378 --> 02:39:13.842
MATT: He takes it hungrily through the bars

02:39:13.842 --> 02:39:16.236
and just starts eating it, incessantly, as you leave.

02:39:16.236 --> 02:39:18.117
TALIESIN: Government cheese.

02:39:18.117 --> 02:39:19.479
LIAM: Is provolone all you've got?

02:39:19.479 --> 02:39:22.459
MATT: Lady Kima's already up the stairs.

02:39:22.459 --> 02:39:23.689
LAURA: It's Velveeta.

02:39:23.689 --> 02:39:24.779
MATT: (disgusted groan) Velveeta!

02:39:24.779 --> 02:39:26.227
SAM: We're following up the stairs.

02:39:26.227 --> 02:39:28.263
MARISHA: (laughs) It's calories!

02:39:28.263 --> 02:39:31.318
MATT: All right. Clean this off here.

02:39:31.318 --> 02:39:32.430
LAURA: Oh goodness, oh goodness!

02:39:32.430 --> 02:39:36.083
TALIESIN: It's going to be fun! Savage burning--

02:39:36.083 --> 02:39:38.737
TRAVIS: I'm right with Minxy, competing for first place.

02:39:38.737 --> 02:39:40.688
LIAM: I place a hand on Lady Kima’s shoulder--

02:39:40.688 --> 02:39:42.421
MARISHA: First place, for how fucked-up we are.

02:39:42.421 --> 02:39:43.478
TRAVIS: Perfection! (laughs)

02:39:43.478 --> 02:39:44.669
MARISHA: Perfection! (laughs)

02:39:44.669 --> 02:39:45.935
LIAM: --place a hand on Kima's shoulder and say,

02:39:45.935 --> 02:39:46.954
“Please, allow me,”

02:39:46.954 --> 02:39:49.272
and move several feet ahead of her
and start sneaking along.

02:39:49.272 --> 02:39:52.252
MATT: As you move up to her, you notice she's standing

02:39:52.252 --> 02:39:55.539
at the bottom of the stairs with a tension,

02:39:55.539 --> 02:39:58.057
staring up at the top of the stairway,

02:39:58.057 --> 02:39:59.729
where Clarota is looking down at her--

02:39:59.729 --> 02:40:00.756
LAURA: (gasps)

02:40:00.756 --> 02:40:02.166
MATT: --and backing away, and she goes--

02:40:02.166 --> 02:40:03.213
ORION: Oh! Yes. Uh--

02:40:03.213 --> 02:40:04.248
LAURA: Wait- Wait!

02:40:04.248 --> 02:40:05.194
MATT: “Who is this filthy--”

02:40:05.194 --> 02:40:06.453
TALIESIN: No no no no!

02:40:06.453 --> 02:40:07.359
MARISHA: (screams)

02:40:07.359 --> 02:40:08.549
ORION: I put my Mage Hand in front of her.

02:40:08.549 --> 02:40:09.592
Wait, wa-wait! Hold on! It- it's fine!

02:40:09.592 --> 02:40:10.911
Er, this mind flayer is with us!

02:40:10.911 --> 02:40:12.763
We saved him, or he- he's our ally now; he's fine.

02:40:12.763 --> 02:40:15.470
No one needs to fight.

02:40:15.470 --> 02:40:20.768
He, uh, she's fine, he's fine. His name is Clarota.

02:40:20.768 --> 02:40:22.540
TALIESIN: He's been an enormous help.

02:40:22.540 --> 02:40:24.407
MATT: Without taking her eyes off of Clarota--

02:40:24.407 --> 02:40:25.495
ORION: This is Kiva-

02:40:25.495 --> 02:40:26.192
SAM: Kima.

02:40:26.192 --> 02:40:27.257
ORION: Kima.

02:40:27.257 --> 02:40:28.548
MATT: She looks back over - (laughs)

02:40:28.548 --> 02:40:34.006
ORION: We are allies, all, yes?

02:40:34.006 --> 02:40:36.707
MATT: “Are you to tell me that you've come down here

02:40:36.707 --> 02:40:42.380
“and allied yourself with an entity that 
is the anathema of the Mountain?”

02:40:42.380 --> 02:40:43.598
ORION: Yes!

02:40:43.598 --> 02:40:45.067
TRAVIS: Uh, what was that word?

02:40:45.067 --> 02:40:46.597
LIAM: I'm right at her shoulder, so I say,

02:40:46.617 --> 02:40:50.579
“We understand he's dangerous, but he's gotten us this far.”

02:40:50.579 --> 02:40:51.692
MATT: “And for what purpose?

02:40:51.692 --> 02:40:54.325
“You think they don't have plots lined out 
for weeks and months--”

02:40:54.325 --> 02:40:55.808
ORION: No, no, no! Listen, listen-

02:40:55.808 --> 02:40:57.253
MATT: “--there is no trust to be had with these creatures.”

02:40:57.253 --> 02:40:59.907
LIAM: He has been shit out by these creatures.

02:40:59.907 --> 02:41:04.354
They do not want him or trust him. 
He is an outcast.

02:41:04.354 --> 02:41:08.250
And we are working together, in this moment,

02:41:08.250 --> 02:41:11.107
and without him we would not have gotten here.

02:41:11.107 --> 02:41:13.042
LAURA: We see a single tear drop from Clarota's eye.

02:41:13.042 --> 02:41:14.950
MATT: “And with him you will never get out.”

02:41:14.950 --> 02:41:18.140
ORION: No! We have his, er, alliance.

02:41:18.140 --> 02:41:21.088
There's a greater entity controlling his people,

02:41:21.088 --> 02:41:26.131
which he has been outcast from, like Vax was saying!

02:41:26.131 --> 02:41:27.571
MATT: “And have you not thought for a second

02:41:27.571 --> 02:41:29.809
“that perhaps all of you are being 
manipulated by this creature?”

02:41:29.809 --> 02:41:31.693
ASHLEY: Well, I have.

02:41:31.693 --> 02:41:33.125
MATT: You can see the greatsword now flares

02:41:33.125 --> 02:41:34.411
with divine energy and she goes,

02:41:34.411 --> 02:41:37.285
“I will not stand here and let us ally 
ourselves with this filth!”

02:41:37.285 --> 02:41:39.235
ORION: (shouting) “Lady Kima!”

02:41:39.235 --> 02:41:41.742
And I blow fire breath.

02:41:41.742 --> 02:41:45.901
And I use Control Flames to create a bunch of swords

02:41:45.901 --> 02:41:47.826
around me with fire.

02:41:47.826 --> 02:41:49.709
LAURA: Don't threaten Kima! She's better.

02:41:49.709 --> 02:41:51.116
ORION: (harshly) I give you my word.

02:41:51.116 --> 02:41:52.579
MATT: Her attention divided from Clarota,

02:41:52.579 --> 02:41:54.043
now tends towards you.

02:41:54.043 --> 02:41:58.665
ORION: Don't act me a fool, and don't 
treat me like one either!

02:41:58.665 --> 02:42:01.771
None of us are half-wits as you are claiming.

02:42:01.771 --> 02:42:05.580
We would not be fooled by such a creature like this.

02:42:05.580 --> 02:42:08.580
The words he speaks are true. And we believe him.

02:42:08.580 --> 02:42:10.487
MATT: You go ahead and make a diplomacy check.

02:42:10.487 --> 02:42:12.141
Or a persuasion. Persuasion check.

02:42:12.141 --> 02:42:12.853
LAURA: Oh god!

02:42:12.853 --> 02:42:13.860
LIAM: Get it on, Tiberius!

02:42:13.860 --> 02:42:14.760
TRAVIS: Do it.

02:42:14.760 --> 02:42:15.782
LIAM: Get. It. On.

02:42:15.782 --> 02:42:17.426
ORION: That's terrible.

02:42:17.426 --> 02:42:19.104
LIAM: Oh. Get it off?

02:42:23.654 --> 02:42:24.903
SAM: Not good.

02:42:24.903 --> 02:42:26.301
LAURA: Not good?

02:42:26.301 --> 02:42:27.364
SAM: Not good!

02:42:27.364 --> 02:42:28.681
ORION: 12.

02:42:28.681 --> 02:42:31.905
MATT: 12. Okay. She walks towards you, 
and with each step,

02:42:31.905 --> 02:42:33.900
you can see the color of her eyes begins to vanish,

02:42:33.900 --> 02:42:37.330
giving way to an extremely bright, burning, silver light.

02:42:37.330 --> 02:42:38.877
And she says--

02:42:38.877 --> 02:42:40.883
LAURA: (whispering) Oh my god, she's so cool!

02:42:40.883 --> 02:42:46.149
MATT: “Listen. You come with me. Without this creature!

02:42:46.149 --> 02:42:48.722
“Or you continue with it, and without me.”

02:42:48.722 --> 02:42:50.287
ORION: Why you have to be like that?

02:42:50.287 --> 02:42:52.437
MATT: “I will not walk beside this.

02:42:52.437 --> 02:42:56.281
“I have had its people devour mine since I set foot in here.

02:42:56.281 --> 02:43:01.098
“This creature, whatever its reasoning is, is not in your best interest.

02:43:01.098 --> 02:43:04.617
“It will lead you into a web of your own destruction!

02:43:04.617 --> 02:43:07.158
“I've seen their kind work.“

02:43:07.158 --> 02:43:08.787
LIAM: Clarota!

02:43:08.787 --> 02:43:10.527
ORION: Yeah, they're mostly buttholes,
but he's not a butthole!

02:43:10.527 --> 02:43:11.780
(all laugh)

02:43:11.780 --> 02:43:12.742
ORION: I understand that -

02:43:12.742 --> 02:43:13.811
LIAM: Clarota!

02:43:13.811 --> 02:43:15.144
ORION: - we had to kill a couple and 
he actually helped a lot!

02:43:15.144 --> 02:43:18.674
LIAM: Speak your mind! Convince her. Fix this.

02:43:18.674 --> 02:43:22.110
MATT: Clarota, at the top of the stairs, 
you can see his tendrils

02:43:22.110 --> 02:43:25.732
in his mouth curl back in a sneer, 
his hands crossed before--

02:43:25.732 --> 02:43:27.279
ORION: He won't even do anything!

02:43:27.279 --> 02:43:28.874
MATT: --Clarota says, (gasping, breathy voice)

02:43:28.874 --> 02:43:35.937
“Listen. I am not going to walk where I am not welcome.

02:43:35.937 --> 02:43:38.017
“I will not wake up with this--”

02:43:38.017 --> 02:43:39.890
LIAM: Giving us a Walking Dead decision.

02:43:39.890 --> 02:43:45.789
MATT: “--woman's blade in my back! We made a deal.”

02:43:48.483 --> 02:43:51.701
MARISHA: People with kids. You deal with this all the time.

02:43:51.701 --> 02:43:53.271
LIAM: I walk between them and put hands out.

02:43:53.271 --> 02:43:54.426
LAURA: Come on, roll a 20!

02:43:54.426 --> 02:43:55.671
LIAM: And say,

02:43:55.671 --> 02:43:57.279
“We all want the same thing.

02:43:57.279 --> 02:43:58.906
“Kima. Tell us. What is it that you've come here for?

02:43:58.906 --> 02:44:02.399
“What is your purpose here? 
Speak your mind, if you are true.”

02:44:02.399 --> 02:44:04.244
MATT: Kima turns back towards you,

02:44:04.244 --> 02:44:07.984
the same glowing flare in her eyes.

02:44:07.984 --> 02:44:11.259
“I've come here to rid this mountain and this continent

02:44:11.259 --> 02:44:14.677
“of the darkness that resides deep within the bowels

02:44:14.677 --> 02:44:15.992
“of this thing's city!”

02:44:15.992 --> 02:44:20.299
LIAM: Clarota, why have you come here.
What is it you seek?

02:44:20.299 --> 02:44:24.618
MATT: Clarota settles into itself for a second.

02:44:24.618 --> 02:44:32.326
“Ah, I've come to destroy this creature 
K'Varn and free my people.”

02:44:32.326 --> 02:44:36.140
LIAM: Then the two of you. Get over your fucking shit.

02:44:36.140 --> 02:44:37.577
(all laugh)

02:44:37.577 --> 02:44:39.756
LIAM: We want the same thing here.

02:44:39.756 --> 02:44:42.586
Get over yourselves. Both of you.

02:44:42.586 --> 02:44:44.767
We share a common purpose.

02:44:44.767 --> 02:44:47.234
We are going to end this fucking bullshit.

02:44:47.234 --> 02:44:50.005
Kima, we have come here for you.

02:44:50.005 --> 02:44:53.437
Pay us the respect that we have earned.

02:44:53.437 --> 02:44:56.328
We have come a long way for you.

02:44:56.328 --> 02:45:00.943
He is an unlikely ally, but he has gotten us to this point.

02:45:00.943 --> 02:45:04.061
And together, for this moment and this moment only,

02:45:04.061 --> 02:45:05.914
we can work together.

02:45:05.914 --> 02:45:09.355
We don't have to be school chums or 
buddies in a week from now.

02:45:09.355 --> 02:45:12.744
But right now, right here, we will work together

02:45:12.744 --> 02:45:14.385
and achieve the same thing.

02:45:14.385 --> 02:45:16.664
What say you, Kima?

02:45:16.664 --> 02:45:18.640
MATT: She looks towards you and says,

02:45:20.550 --> 02:45:23.975
“Free his people, he says.

02:45:23.975 --> 02:45:27.653
“What do you think will happen once 
his people are free?

02:45:27.653 --> 02:45:29.591
“Shall they let us walk out on our own?”

02:45:29.591 --> 02:45:31.473
ORION: Yes! He said so!

02:45:31.473 --> 02:45:35.201
And then they'll be buttholes when we leave!

02:45:37.128 --> 02:45:40.580
MATT: “You know so very little of these 
dark caverns, my dragon friend.”

02:45:40.580 --> 02:45:41.921
ORION: Yeah, it's our first time here!

02:45:41.921 --> 02:45:45.628
MATT: “These entities I watched steal 
the very life essence

02:45:45.628 --> 02:45:48.927
“of the men and women I hired and travelled with

02:45:48.927 --> 02:45:51.975
“for weeks down here. I watched them capture them,

02:45:51.975 --> 02:45:55.075
“and devour their very minds before me,

02:45:55.075 --> 02:45:58.558
“and laugh and cackle as I fled into the shadows.”

02:45:58.558 --> 02:46:01.431
LAURA: But they were under control of 
K'Varn at that point. Yeah!

02:46:01.431 --> 02:46:04.934
MATT: “Oh! Understand; whether or not K'Varn

02:46:04.934 --> 02:46:07.687
“controls them to give them direction,

02:46:07.687 --> 02:46:14.474
“they are of that type of mindset at all points.

02:46:14.474 --> 02:46:16.872
“They do not hope society will thrive.

02:46:16.872 --> 02:46:20.310
“They do not want us free peoples to walk the surface.

02:46:20.310 --> 02:46:23.625
“They want us for food.“

02:46:23.625 --> 02:46:25.744
SAM: Lady Kima, if I may.

02:46:25.744 --> 02:46:34.423
If you're intending us to choose between you, 
and our ally Clarota,

02:46:34.423 --> 02:46:38.132
and we can't get you to see eye to eye with us,

02:46:38.132 --> 02:46:40.278
then I'm afraid you leave us no choice but

02:46:40.278 --> 02:46:43.226
to choose our own friend Clarota over you.

02:46:43.226 --> 02:46:44.670
LAURA: (gasps) What?

02:46:44.670 --> 02:46:46.534
SAM: We're giving you one last chance.

02:46:46.534 --> 02:46:50.612
Either you are with us, or you are against us.

02:46:50.612 --> 02:46:53.242
This is a threat.

02:46:53.242 --> 02:46:57.156
MATT: “So you walk in here, save me from my binds,

02:46:57.156 --> 02:47:02.939
“under the words of my dear, 
lifelong friend Arcanist Allura--”

02:47:02.939 --> 02:47:05.556
SAM: We mean you no ill will.

02:47:05.556 --> 02:47:08.446
It is you who are aggravating the situation.

02:47:08.446 --> 02:47:12.910
LIAM: You could be sitting in a cell 
by yourself doing fuck-all,

02:47:12.910 --> 02:47:15.614
or ending this problem now.

02:47:15.614 --> 02:47:18.211
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

02:47:18.211 --> 02:47:20.156
MARISHA: Everyone's giving her inspirational talks.

02:47:20.156 --> 02:47:23.044
LAURA: I'm so nervous! Oh, Scanlan, come on!

02:47:24.539 --> 02:47:26.138
SAM: Well, I rolled a 3...

02:47:26.138 --> 02:47:27.770
LIAM: I rolled a 13.

02:47:27.770 --> 02:47:29.461
SAM: But I have a plus 13!

02:47:29.461 --> 02:47:31.361
So that's a 16.

02:47:31.361 --> 02:47:34.972
LIAM: Plus 13? 3 plus 13? Okay.

02:47:34.972 --> 02:47:37.469
ASHLEY: Plus, plus, uh... hold on.

02:47:37.469 --> 02:47:38.608
(all laugh)

02:47:38.608 --> 02:47:40.401
ASHLEY: Because, you didn't- where the fuck.

02:47:40.401 --> 02:47:42.654
(all laugh)

02:47:42.654 --> 02:47:44.372
ASHLEY: War God's Blessing!

02:47:44.372 --> 02:47:45.606
MATT: Cleric flail!

02:47:45.606 --> 02:47:48.381
ASHLEY: No, I can't do that, because that's when 
a person makes an attack roll.

02:47:48.381 --> 02:47:49.725
(all laugh)

02:47:49.725 --> 02:47:51.276
ASHLEY: Get 'em, Scanlan!

02:47:51.276 --> 02:47:52.128
(all laugh)

02:47:52.128 --> 02:47:54.090
TALIESIN: Can I assist?

02:47:54.090 --> 02:47:56.021
LAURA: He assisted because he was talking--

02:47:56.021 --> 02:47:57.563
MATT: Unfortunately, it's too late. Once the roll--

02:47:57.563 --> 02:47:59.123
SAM: No, he was with me, he was with me.

02:47:59.123 --> 02:48:00.210
LAURA: He assisted?

02:48:00.210 --> 02:48:04.033
MATT: Right, right. And because of that, the DC 
has been considered.

02:48:04.033 --> 02:48:05.848
She takes a moment and steps forward.

02:48:05.848 --> 02:48:08.105
She's a few inches taller than you.

02:48:08.105 --> 02:48:09.708
SAM: Of course she is! Everyone is!

02:48:09.708 --> 02:48:11.695
(all laugh)

02:48:11.695 --> 02:48:14.153
MATT: And she looks at you, and says,

02:48:14.153 --> 02:48:16.070
“He of the pretty voice.

02:48:20.130 --> 02:48:23.935
“I am grateful that all of you have come and traversed

02:48:23.935 --> 02:48:28.620
“all this danger in my name, to free me

02:48:28.620 --> 02:48:31.275
“from the binds that have held me.

02:48:31.275 --> 02:48:35.691
“And I do wish, very much, to walk 
alongside you to this end.

02:48:35.691 --> 02:48:42.149
“And I understand, it may be very well
possible that this thing

02:48:42.149 --> 02:48:47.427
“has taken your minds without 
your knowledge. However--”

02:48:47.427 --> 02:48:50.052
And her eyes close for a second, and 
she opens them again,

02:48:50.052 --> 02:48:53.068
and that radiant spark of silver fades,

02:48:53.068 --> 02:48:55.328
and her normal eye color returns.

02:48:57.068 --> 02:48:59.603
“We see ourselves with little choices.

02:49:04.473 --> 02:49:08.263
“And I have very little allies at this point 
to achieve my goal.”

02:49:08.263 --> 02:49:09.937
LAURA: (whispering) Oh, thank god.

02:49:09.937 --> 02:49:17.977
MATT: “If we are to travel together, this one 
must walk in step the entire time.

02:49:17.977 --> 02:49:22.831
“One single misstep, and I will not hesitate

02:49:22.831 --> 02:49:26.417
“to carve that head from your body 
in the name of Bahamut.

02:49:26.417 --> 02:49:28.591
ORION: I'm sorry. Do you mean like dancing?

02:49:28.591 --> 02:49:32.873
TRAVIS: I will help you do that if he missteps.

02:49:32.873 --> 02:49:35.623
MATT: Clarota, hands still crossed,

02:49:35.623 --> 02:49:38.235
takes a step down the stairs towards her.

02:49:38.235 --> 02:49:41.852
Its tendrils in its mouth kind of-- (slurping SFX)

02:49:41.852 --> 02:49:45.536
(breathy voice) “And please, understand,

02:49:45.536 --> 02:49:51.163
“if you ever intend to try and cut my life short,

02:49:51.163 --> 02:49:59.499
“I will also not hesitate to bore that 
beautiful mind from your skull.”

02:49:59.499 --> 02:50:04.028
LIAM: Once we murder this K'Varn, 
you guys are going to laugh so hard.

02:50:04.028 --> 02:50:05.872
LAURA &amp;amp; MATT: (laugh)

02:50:05.872 --> 02:50:07.035
SAM: So friends then?

02:50:07.035 --> 02:50:08.166
ORION: Allies, allies.

02:50:08.166 --> 02:50:09.493
TRAVIS: Allies, allies.
LAURA: Allies?

02:50:09.493 --> 02:50:11.472
TALIESIN: I suppose everybody understands 
everyone now.

02:50:11.472 --> 02:50:13.132
ORION: Allies. Clarota likes allies.

02:50:13.132 --> 02:50:14.222
LAURA: Good times.

02:50:14.222 --> 02:50:15.429
LIAM: The enemy of my enemy...

02:50:15.429 --> 02:50:17.072
ORION: Is...
LAURA: Is my...

02:50:17.072 --> 02:50:19.934
SAM: Has mind-sucking tentacles.

02:50:19.934 --> 02:50:21.357
MATT: She looks back at the rest of you

02:50:21.357 --> 02:50:23.642
and gives you all an understanding look and a nod

02:50:23.642 --> 02:50:25.125
and she says,

02:50:25.125 --> 02:50:30.720
“I pray that you are right. I pray that you're honest

02:50:30.720 --> 02:50:35.191
“and I pray that through some strange will of the gods,

02:50:35.191 --> 02:50:37.705
“this entity is telling the truth.

02:50:37.705 --> 02:50:42.871
“Because if it's not, none of us will make 
it out of here alive.”

02:50:42.871 --> 02:50:47.656
LIAM: We're playing a game of chess here, 
Kima, and we will win.

02:50:47.656 --> 02:50:49.007
LAURA: I whisper in her ear:

02:50:49.007 --> 02:50:51.936
“I would have chosen you.”

02:50:51.936 --> 02:50:54.208
SAM: And I start humming 'Kumbaya'.

02:50:54.208 --> 02:50:56.404
(all laughing)

02:50:56.404 --> 02:50:58.582
SAM (singing softly): Kumbaya, my lord. Kumbaya.

02:50:58.582 --> 02:51:00.917
ORION: I take the dagger and make a happy face of fire.

02:51:00.917 --> 02:51:03.649
MATT: She doesn't notice this, as she steps 
up the stairs towards Clarota.

02:51:03.649 --> 02:51:04.874
LAURA: Oh god. Okay.

02:51:04.874 --> 02:51:07.172
MATT: Clarota steps back, hands up in front, this little spark

02:51:07.172 --> 02:51:09.803
of arcane energy forming in his hands.

02:51:09.803 --> 02:51:12.202
Clarota [sic], bringing the sword up in front of her,

02:51:12.202 --> 02:51:15.106
pushes Clarota aside and continues ascending

02:51:15.106 --> 02:51:17.237
back up the stairs to the first level.

02:51:17.237 --> 02:51:18.444
(offscreen thump)

02:51:18.444 --> 02:51:19.911
MATT: --To the first level.

02:51:19.911 --> 02:51:20.877
(all laugh)

02:51:20.877 --> 02:51:22.766
ORION: Killing two guards on the way.

02:51:22.766 --> 02:51:25.339
MATT: Clarota puts the hands folded back together.

02:51:25.339 --> 02:51:28.803
(unimpressed huff) (breathy voice) “Shall we?”

02:51:28.803 --> 02:51:31.844
And walks up the stairs after her.

02:51:31.844 --> 02:51:34.230
And you all begin to ascend back onto the first floor

02:51:34.230 --> 02:51:36.062
and that’s where we’ll end the game for this evening.

02:51:36.062 --> 02:51:37.864
(Multiple groans and exclamations)

02:51:37.864 --> 02:51:39.634
MARISHA: What? No. What time is it?
I thought we just got started?

02:51:39.634 --> 02:51:40.784
TRAVIS: I thought we were going to have to pick.

02:51:40.784 --> 02:51:41.817
We got like ten more minutes!

02:51:41.817 --> 02:51:43.002
MARISHA: Yeah, we have ten more minutes.
SAM: No, no, no. That's fine, that's fine.

02:51:43.002 --> 02:51:44.429
LAURA: No, yeah, that is a good place,
or we're going to get in a battle.

02:51:44.429 --> 02:51:46.521
MATT: (chuckles) Depending on where 
you guys are going next

02:51:46.521 --> 02:51:49.020
it could be a bit of a lengthy encounter, so...

02:51:49.020 --> 02:51:49.987
LAURA: Oh god.

02:51:49.987 --> 02:51:51.785
LIAM: So the building is empty.

02:51:51.785 --> 02:51:53.053
MATT: It's totally empty.

02:51:53.053 --> 02:51:54.105
LAURA: Completely empty.

02:51:54.105 --> 02:51:55.638
LIAM: There's ghouls everywhere.

02:51:55.638 --> 02:51:57.161
MATT: There’s nobody in there.
No one has any idea that you're here.

02:51:57.161 --> 02:51:58.604
TRAVIS: Wait, show of hands, if we have to pick

02:51:58.604 --> 02:51:59.913
between one or the other, who's picking Kima?

02:51:59.913 --> 02:52:00.791
ORION: Oh, Kima?

02:52:00.791 --> 02:52:02.829
TRAVIS: Who's picking turtle-face?

02:52:02.829 --> 02:52:04.234
LIAM: I don't know.

02:52:04.234 --> 02:52:05.811
ORION: She's Allura's friend, right?

02:52:05.811 --> 02:52:07.145
TRAVIS: We're going to throw down, this is gonna be

02:52:07.145 --> 02:52:07.877
Marvel versus DC in this bitch.

02:52:07.877 --> 02:52:08.797
LAURA: She's Allura's friend, she's good!

02:52:08.797 --> 02:52:09.826
LIAM: Undecided, I don't know.

02:52:09.826 --> 02:52:10.646
LAURA: Would you pick Kima?

02:52:10.646 --> 02:52:11.773
TRAVIS: Yeah!

02:52:11.773 --> 02:52:12.748
LAURA: Okay, yeah.

02:52:12.748 --> 02:52:14.544
SAM: You just want her because she's badass

02:52:14.544 --> 02:52:16.115
and you could hump her.

02:52:16.115 --> 02:52:16.970
TRAVIS: Yeah!

02:52:16.970 --> 02:52:17.727
(all laugh)

02:52:17.727 --> 02:52:18.687
MATT: Oh, Grog.

02:52:18.687 --> 02:52:19.880
LAURA: That would be the most awkward humping ever.

02:52:19.880 --> 02:52:21.008
ORION: That's a good idea. Grog!

02:52:21.008 --> 02:52:21.898
You can go hump, I can get Allura.

02:52:21.898 --> 02:52:22.859
LIAM: She can hump your leg.

02:52:22.859 --> 02:52:23.828
TRAVIS: Did you see her work in that room of blood?

02:52:23.828 --> 02:52:25.463
TALIESIN: Only one of them is demanding that 
I become a liar.

02:52:25.463 --> 02:52:27.135
MARISHA: Isn't Kima a dwarf?

02:52:27.135 --> 02:52:28.548
MATT: No, Kima is a halfling.

02:52:28.548 --> 02:52:29.977
LAURA: Kima is a halfling.
MARISHA: Halfling?

02:52:29.977 --> 02:52:31.088
LIAM: She's a ropy, muscular, halfling.

02:52:31.088 --> 02:52:33.521
ASHLEY: Wait, dang it! I wanted to 
take some torture weapons!

02:52:33.521 --> 02:52:35.050
MATT: You can go back if you want to.

02:52:35.050 --> 02:52:36.608
ASHLEY: Yeah, can I go back since we have ten minutes

02:52:36.608 --> 02:52:37.956
and go get some torture weapons?

02:52:37.956 --> 02:52:39.077
LIAM: What's it for?!

02:52:39.077 --> 02:52:40.377
(all laugh)

02:52:40.377 --> 02:52:41.560
MATT: This would be pretty quick, you have

02:52:41.560 --> 02:52:42.855
to grab some things as everyone 
is heading up the stairs.

02:52:42.855 --> 02:52:44.506
LIAM: Who's your deity? Harvey Keitel?

02:52:44.506 --> 02:52:45.570
(More laughing)

02:52:45.570 --> 02:52:47.048
ASHLEY: No! Just for Grog!

02:52:47.048 --> 02:52:49.169
MATT: So, Pike, the war priest, however,

02:52:49.169 --> 02:52:53.576
who the light of Sarenrae has guided 
her through her life,

02:52:53.576 --> 02:52:57.259
once a gifted being of light and joy,

02:52:57.259 --> 02:52:59.444
upon coming to the edge of death,

02:52:59.444 --> 02:53:01.242
her soul taken from her form and returned,

02:53:01.242 --> 02:53:03.427
going at sea and traveling with some of the more

02:53:03.427 --> 02:53:05.859
rough and tumble folks of the landscape,

02:53:05.859 --> 02:53:09.482
has returned now with her mind bent 
on war, vengeance--

02:53:09.482 --> 02:53:10.821
TRAVIS: Yeah!

02:53:10.821 --> 02:53:12.626
MATT: --and what it means to win a battle,

02:53:12.626 --> 02:53:14.768
through force if necessary.

02:53:14.768 --> 02:53:18.495
Watching Pike rush off and going to gather up

02:53:18.495 --> 02:53:22.168
what appear to be two large, bladed hooks--

02:53:22.168 --> 02:53:23.649
ASHLEY: (hissing)

02:53:23.649 --> 02:53:27.156
MATT: .--a lengthy hand-razor--

02:53:27.156 --> 02:53:29.315
TALIESIN: Nice.

02:53:29.315 --> 02:53:32.208
ASHLEY: Okay, wait, hold on. Lengthy hand-razor...

02:53:32.208 --> 02:53:33.809
MARISHA: You're going to go Sweeney Todd 
all up in this shit.

02:53:33.809 --> 02:53:35.230
LAURA: (mimicking Ashley) Hold on, hold on. 
Lengthy hand-razor.

02:53:35.230 --> 02:53:36.205
(More laughter)

02:53:36.205 --> 02:53:37.843
LIAM: A Milli Vanilli album, and...

02:53:37.843 --> 02:53:39.007
ASHLEY: Wait, what was the first one?

02:53:39.007 --> 02:53:41.474
MATT: Two large, pointed hooks that are 
about two feet in length.

02:53:41.474 --> 02:53:42.862
Almost like a bladed jai alai.

02:53:42.862 --> 02:53:43.953
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:53:43.953 --> 02:53:49.623
MATT: And you gather a small bag of various instruments

02:53:49.623 --> 02:53:50.821
that are rusty and nasty.

02:53:50.821 --> 02:53:51.802
LAURA: Ew.

02:53:51.802 --> 02:53:53.789
MATT: There is just some leather pouch and 
you put that in your bag.

02:53:53.789 --> 02:53:56.139
It's all you have time to grab before you 
have to bolt back up to get to the rest.

02:53:56.139 --> 02:53:57.314
TALIESIN: (swishing SFX)

02:53:57.314 --> 02:53:58.563
MATT: And we'll pick up the next game as you guys

02:53:58.563 --> 02:53:59.854
head up the stairs back into the hallway

02:53:59.854 --> 02:54:03.642
you first entered in the center of the 
Emberhold duergar stronghold,

02:54:03.642 --> 02:54:08.438
Lady Kima released and a very tentative alliance.

02:54:08.438 --> 02:54:10.341
So, thank you guys all for watching.

02:54:10.341 --> 02:54:11.604
ASHLEY: Whoo!

02:54:11.604 --> 02:54:14.139
MARISHA: Pain in the ass, Lady Kima. Pain in my ass.

02:54:14.139 --> 02:54:15.307
LAURA: Hey.

02:54:15.307 --> 02:54:16.643
ZAC: Oh hey.

02:54:16.643 --> 02:54:17.531
MATT: Hello, Zac!

02:54:17.531 --> 02:54:18.912
ZAC: I was doing my little pop-ins here.

02:54:18.912 --> 02:54:19.771
MATT: Yeah.

02:54:19.771 --> 02:54:22.121
ZAC: So we had some donations to the charity.

02:54:22.121 --> 02:54:23.240
MATT: Oh, that's awesome!

02:54:23.240 --> 02:54:24.142
LAURA: Really?

02:54:24.142 --> 02:54:25.041
MARISHA: Yeah!

02:54:25.041 --> 02:54:26.051
MARISHA: Thanks guys.

02:54:26.051 --> 02:54:28.098
ZAC: I have really terrible handwriting, so...

02:54:28.098 --> 02:54:30.574
So I wrote these myself and I'm supposed to read them and...

02:54:30.574 --> 02:54:31.715
MATT: Right, right, that's okay.

02:54:31.715 --> 02:54:34.068
ZAC: TheConman93.

02:54:34.068 --> 02:54:35.474
MATT: Conman93, thank you!

02:54:35.474 --> 02:54:37.765
ZAC: ...Marilyn?

02:54:37.765 --> 02:54:39.169
MATT: Marilyn, thank you!

02:54:39.169 --> 02:54:41.956
ZAC: A123Junior.

02:54:41.956 --> 02:54:45.210
MATT: A123Junior, appreciate it, buddy.

02:54:45.210 --> 02:54:46.821
ZAC: Poltergeist123.

02:54:46.821 --> 02:54:50.585
MATT: Poltergeist123, yeah. All good movies. First two.

02:54:50.585 --> 02:54:53.687
ZAC: Almsnuffufin... Um, Eon? Something?

02:54:53.687 --> 02:54:55.625
MATT: Yeah MisnurMenfrishunsen.

02:54:55.625 --> 02:54:57.106
ZAC: AxisOfAnarchy...

02:54:57.106 --> 02:54:58.039
MATT: Thank you. Nice, Axis.

02:54:58.039 --> 02:54:59.499
ZAC: RuzGofDi.

02:54:59.499 --> 02:55:02.125
MATT: RuzGofDi! Thank you guys so much for donating! 
Really appreciate it.

02:55:02.125 --> 02:55:05.720
ZAC: Give to charity. Thank you.

02:55:05.720 --> 02:55:06.926
MATT: Thank you, guys.

02:55:06.926 --> 02:55:09.621
ZAC: So thank you guys for tuning in tonight

02:55:09.621 --> 02:55:11.600
and for all you front page viewers.

02:55:11.600 --> 02:55:16.049
We stream 6 to 7 hours 5 to 6 days a week.

02:55:16.049 --> 02:55:19.338
We do a lot of varied programming, 
from comic book shows

02:55:19.338 --> 02:55:23.803
to tabletop gaming to Steam group 
games, indie gaming.

02:55:23.803 --> 02:55:25.554
All sorts of fun stuff.

02:55:25.554 --> 02:55:28.955
Every Friday night we have live music and 
bands play and stuff.

02:55:28.955 --> 02:55:30.066
LAURA: Nice!

02:55:30.066 --> 02:55:31.785
ZAC: And tomorrow we're having a special party to celebrate

02:55:31.785 --> 02:55:34.060
our reaching 2000 subscribers.

02:55:34.060 --> 02:55:36.138
MATT: Yeah. That's awesome.

02:55:36.138 --> 02:55:37.242
(Cheering and clapping)

02:55:37.242 --> 02:55:38.363
ZAC: You guys are all welcome to stop by.

02:55:38.363 --> 02:55:39.656
MATT: We might just do that. Awesome.

02:55:39.656 --> 02:55:40.622
ZAC: It's from 7 to 9 we'll have a band playing,

02:55:40.622 --> 02:55:41.763
we're gonna do some fun group games.

02:55:41.763 --> 02:55:44.226
Probably play some inappropriate 
Cards Against Humanity.

02:55:44.226 --> 02:55:45.727
And Super Fight and stuff like that.

02:55:45.727 --> 02:55:48.138
MATT: As if there was appropriate 
Cards Against Humanity.

02:55:48.138 --> 02:55:49.806
ZAC: Every time I break it out, I'm like, 
I should never do this.

02:55:49.806 --> 02:55:51.143
(all laugh)

02:55:51.143 --> 02:55:52.386
MATT: I know. It's part of the fun.

02:55:52.386 --> 02:55:55.578
And we're every Thursday, 7 o'clock, 
7PM Pacific Standard Time.

02:55:55.578 --> 02:55:58.705
Usually we run about 2 and a half, 3 hours, 
our game sessions.

02:55:58.705 --> 02:56:01.527
So please come watch every Thursday. 
We love to have you guys.

02:56:01.527 --> 02:56:04.713
ZAC: And for Team Hooman tomorrow 
is Ify Appreciation Day.

02:56:04.713 --> 02:56:08.246
So if you guys want to get on that.

02:56:08.246 --> 02:56:12.811
And for those that know Ify as sholfboys 
and not much else,

02:56:12.811 --> 02:56:17.067
Ify is a really prominent figure in 
the local comedy scene

02:56:17.067 --> 02:56:21.144
and he does a lot of work on shows like Key &amp;amp; Peele,

02:56:21.144 --> 02:56:23.112
Comedy Bang! Bang!, stuff like that.

02:56:23.112 --> 02:56:24.342
He's a really talented dude.

02:56:24.342 --> 02:56:26.678
You should look him up before you write those tweets

02:56:26.678 --> 02:56:28.846
just so you know more of what he's about.

02:56:28.846 --> 02:56:32.336
And we are going to throw that dropcam up 
and set up for dancing.

02:56:32.336 --> 02:56:34.667
If any of you want to stay, you're welcome to.

02:56:34.667 --> 02:56:36.879
If not, you're welcome to leave. 
No one is going to force you,

02:56:36.879 --> 02:56:38.534
except chatroom now that I brought it up.

02:56:38.534 --> 02:56:40.221
(all laugh)

02:56:40.221 --> 02:56:41.281
ASHLEY: I mean, it's a good workout after all this food.

02:56:41.281 --> 02:56:42.521
ZAC: You burn some calories after all that chicken, right?

02:56:42.521 --> 02:56:43.355
ASHLEY: Burn some calories...

02:56:43.355 --> 02:56:44.101
LAURA: Right, right.

02:56:44.101 --> 02:56:44.824
MATT: Exactly.

02:56:44.824 --> 02:56:46.131
ZAC: We are, I think, 20 away from a giveaway.

02:56:46.131 --> 02:56:48.902
So as long as we're live, the giveaway counts.

02:56:48.902 --> 02:56:49.963
TRAVIS: Is valid.

02:56:49.963 --> 02:56:50.705
MATT: Exactly.

02:56:50.705 --> 02:56:52.999
ZAC: So, if you get 20 subs before we go offline

02:56:52.999 --> 02:56:56.197
we will ship this wherever you are in the world.

02:56:56.197 --> 02:56:58.046
So, let's throw the dropcam up!

02:56:58.046 --> 02:56:59.857
MATT: Yeah guys, thank you so much! (kiss)
